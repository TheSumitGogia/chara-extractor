King Louis XIII is King of France. Louis XIII is not much of a ruler, and is dominated by his advisors, most notably Cardinal Richelieu, the most powerful man in France. He is a petulant and petty person, and those around him who are most successful are those who have learned to manipulate his pettiness.
