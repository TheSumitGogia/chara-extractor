Queen Anne is Queen of France. Anne is Spanish, and her loyalties are divided between her Spanish heritage, her position as Queen of France, and her love for George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham. The King does not trust her, or particularly like her, and the Cardinal hates her. Anne leads an unhappy life in the court.
