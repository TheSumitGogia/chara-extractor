Arya Stark (Arry, Weasel, Nymeria, Nan) is the youngest daughter of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Stark. Nine-year-old Arya is missing and presumed dead, but she is alive and disguised as a feisty young boy on the way to the Wall. From a young age, she has rejected the trappings of being a lady in favor of learning to be a warrior.
