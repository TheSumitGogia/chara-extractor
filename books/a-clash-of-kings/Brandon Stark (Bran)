Brandon Stark (Bran) is the second son of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Stark. At eight years old, Bran oversees Winterfell while his brother Robb and his mother are gone. Bran was paralyzed in a fall and cannot walk. Like his half-brother Jon Snow, Bran is a warg (skinchanger), capable of inhabiting his direwolf, Summer, during dreams, though Bran's ability is much greater.
