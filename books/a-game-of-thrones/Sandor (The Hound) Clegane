Sandor (The Hound) Clegane is Prince Joffâ€™s unofficial bodyguard. Proud that he is not a knight, The Hound appears to have no scruples whatsoever and does what Joffrey orders, however cruel or unjust, without question. His face is scarred on one side by extensive burning inflicted by his brother, Gregor.
