Ser Jorah Mormont is an exiled knight who serves unofficially as Daenerysâ€™s chief advisor. Though he was exiled by Ned Stark for selling slaves, he is intelligent, valiant, and a great fighter. He swears allegiance to Viserys as true king of Westeros, but he also feeds information about the Targaryens back to Varys.
