Jon Snow is the bastard son of Eddard Stark and a brother of the Night's Watch. Because he was a bastard, he was never treated as a true member of the Stark family, leaving him feeling uncertain of his identity. Jon joins the wildlings and pretends to be a turncoat, but the more time he spends in their company, the more he respects them, leading him to further questioning of his identity.
