Robb Stark is the oldest son of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. Robb is only 16, yet he has won numerous battles. Somewhat foolhardy, he marries Jeyne Westerling despite his promise that he would marry a Frey girl, a move that proves disastrous. Robb is ultimately assassinated during the Red Wedding, a massacre of his family and court.
