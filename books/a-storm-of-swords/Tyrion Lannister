Tyrion Lannister is the youngest son of Tywin Lannister. He is a little person, or dwarf in the parlance of the book, and is regularly mocked by those around him. He's also incredibly shrewd and intelligent, and he's often able to turn others' perception of him to his advantage. Tyrion is cynical and sarcastic, but he also has moments of mercy and kindness. He marries Sansa Stark during the course of the novel.
