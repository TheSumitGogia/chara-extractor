Bartle Massey is the schoolteacher and Adam’s best friend. Unbeknownst to his friends, not only does Mr. Massey care deeply for his students, but he exhibits a patience with them that he seldom shows in the company of friends. Mr. Massey rails against the stupidity of women and says everything twice. During Hetty’s trial, he is a tactful comfort to Adam because he is able to see when it is best not to speak.
