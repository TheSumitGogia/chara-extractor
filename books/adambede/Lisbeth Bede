Lisbeth Bede is the mother of Adam and Seth, the wife of Thias. Lisbeth shrieks at her children, complains incessantly about the wrongs the world does to her, and wishes for death when her husband dies. For all that, she loves Adam and Seth, although she favors Adam over Seth and never spares Seth’s feelings on the subject. She is the first to remark on Adam and Dinah’s love for each other.
