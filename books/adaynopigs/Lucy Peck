Lucy Peck is Robert's mother. Whereas Haven is eager for Robert to grow up, Lucy always treats Robert like a boy. She lavishes love and care on him, heals his wounds, mends his pants, and helps him through his broken heart. She is a hardy woman who can cook just about anything, and she never complains about the way Haven smells after a day of killing pigs.
