Berkeley Cole is Good friends with the narrator. Berkeley is an innately aristocratic man who helps the narrator to develop fine tastes. His aristocracy can be seen in his insistence of drinking champagne each morning in the forest. He, like Denys Finch-Hatton, possesses a level of gentility that allows him to easily transcend cultural differences. He can speak Masai and gets along well with most natives. He is a gentle man with a good heart, although he frequently acts as a jokester, or a buffoon. Berkeley's desire to always enjoy life is what ultimately leads to his death. Even know he knows that his life may be in jeopardy, he refuses to remain in bed for a month and rest.
