Esa is the narrator's original cook who is later murdered by his wife. Esa is an older man, who is described as being very gentle. Esa often is taken advantage of by other people, perhaps because of his gentility. Later Esa acquires a young wife, after inheriting a cow. She too uses him, first by deserting him for other native men and then by murdering him. Perhaps Esa's lust for a younger wife led to his death, but overall he is a gentle, kind figure whose murder was simply a tragedy.
