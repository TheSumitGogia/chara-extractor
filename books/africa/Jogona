Jogona is the father of Wamai. Jogona is an upright, kind figure. He is poor, but appears to have worked hard in order to take care of his adopted son and wife. During the legal disputes, Jogona's figure helps to provide a contrast with Kinanu, the Kikuyu man who is held responsible for the shooting of Jogona's son. Jogona appears more honest and upright than Kinanu. Although others accuse Jogona of misdeeds, after Jogona gives his account to the narrator, he is able to establish that he is an honest, forthright figure and therefore is properly compensated.
