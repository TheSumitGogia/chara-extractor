Kabero is the Kikuyu boy who accidentally shoots the other boys during the shooting accident. Kabero initially appears a tragic figure, as he is presumed dead by lions or suicide. Later, it is discovered that he is not dead. Instead he has been living with the Masai. By becoming a Masai and returning to the farm, Kabero serves to personify the differences between the neighboring tribes. As a Kikuyu boy, he was a slightly disobedient servant, but as a Masai he stands tall and noble with formality. The two tribes live close together, but are very different as Kabero indicates.
