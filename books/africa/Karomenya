Karomenya is a young native boy who is deaf and dumb. Karomenya lives entirely in his own world because he lacks the ability to speak and hear. The other native children do not like him as they say he is violent. Eventually, Karomenya befriends the narrator's dogs after he learns to use a whistle. He tires of the dogs as well, and loses the whistle with no interest in getting it back. The narrator fears for Karomenya's future since he is a nomad in his own culture as well as the harsh colonial world.
