Kinanjui is the Chief of the Kikuyus. Kinanjui is one of the most noble of the local natives. His profile itself appears aristocratic and he always holds himself upright. Although he does not have the luxuries that European aristocrats use, such as palaces, Kinanjui manages to make his dignity known by his stance and his behavior. The narrator likes Kinanjui and often uses him to arbitrate disputes on her farm. By the end of the novel, he turns into a tragic figure. He dies from a wound to his knee that turns gangrenous. It is an unfortunate illness, but one that could have been cured had Kinanjui had access to medical treatment. Furthermore, with his death the future leadership of the Kikuyu people is not secure, and the narrator implicitly suggests that bad things may lie ahead for the natives.
