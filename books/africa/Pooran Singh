Pooran Singh is the blacksmith on the farm. Singh is an Indian from Kashmir who has not seen his family in many years, but who frequently sends money to them. Because of his trade as a blacksmith, the narrator pictures him as a mythic character, like one of the Gods who bends metal in beautiful ways. Although he is discussed infrequently, Pooran Singh is a sympathetic character. Tears run down his face and into his long black beard when he realizes that the farm is truly closing. This description of his sensitivity suggests that he is a gentle, hardworking man, despite the fierceness of his trade.
