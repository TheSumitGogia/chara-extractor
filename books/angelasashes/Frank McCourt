Frank McCourt is the book’s author, narrator, and protagonist. As the teller of his own life story, McCourt writes from the perspective of an adolescent looking out onto the world rather than as an adult looking back on his childhood. McCourt’s memoir therefore maintains a voice and perspective rich with the enthusiasm, tenderness, and determination of a young man.
