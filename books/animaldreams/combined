Codi is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. After losing her mother at age three and her unborn child at age fifteen, Codi does not want to love anything for fear of losing it. She blends a fierce independence with a deep desire to find someone who will help give her life meaning. Unsure of her direction in life or of her connection to her past, Codi thinks of herself as an awkward outsider in Grace and wherever she goes. She slowly learns that not only does she have a great deal to offer the community, but also that she is and always has been a beloved member of a large family.
Doc Homer is Codi and Hallie's father and the person from whose perspective the secondary third person narrator interjects. Although he serves as the sole town doctor for Grace his entire life, Doc Homer, partly of his own volition, always feels like an outsider.

As he loses his mind to Alzheimer's disease, he also loses many of his inhibitions and is finally able to at least voice his care for and understanding of Codi.
