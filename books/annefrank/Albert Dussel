Albert Dussel is a dentist and an acquaintance of the Franks who hides with them in the annex. His real name is Fritz Pfeffer, but Anne calls him Mr. Dussel in the diary. Anne finds Mr. Dussel particularly difficult to deal with because he shares a room with her, and she suffers the brunt of his odd personal hygiene habits, pedantic lectures, and controlling tendencies. Mr. Dusselâ€™s wife is a Christian, so she does not go into hiding, and he is separated from her. He dies on December20,1944, at the Neuengamme concentration camp.
