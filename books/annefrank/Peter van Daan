Peter van Daan is the teenage son of the van Daans, whose real name is Peter van Pels. Anne first sees Peter as obnoxious, lazy, and hypersensitive, but later they become close friends. Peter is quiet, timid, honest, and sweet to Anne, but he does not share her strong convictions. During their time in the annex, Anne and Peter develop a romantic attraction, which Mr. Frank discourages. Peter is Anneâ€™s first kiss, and he is her one confidant and source of affection and attention in the annex. Peter dies on May5,1945, at the concentration camp at Mauthausen, only three days before the camp was liberated.
