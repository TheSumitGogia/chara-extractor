Dr. Rippleton Holabird is a department head at McGurk, Holabird has very much the same business mind-set as Tubbs. He believes in competition and success and eventually joins the League of Cultural Agencies with Tubbs. He constantly brags about an old war wound and becomes another foil for Martin's personality.
