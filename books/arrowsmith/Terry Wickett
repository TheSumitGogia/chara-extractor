A laboratory scientist much like Gottlieb, Terry Wickett is completely committed to his work. He does not have a family or much of a social life because of this commitment. He is the extreme of what Martin could be, and by the end of the novel he becomes the symbol of freedom and independence. He is very much an individual in a world of "collaborators" and he strives always for what he believes. He is stubborn and thought of as cold, though he and Martin have an "understanding" of each other and are, in fact comrades by the end.
