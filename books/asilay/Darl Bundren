Darl Bundren is the second Bundren child. Darl is the most sensitive and articulate of the surviving Bundrens and delivers the greatest number of interior monologues in the novel. As the family encounters disaster upon disaster during the trip, Darl’s frustration with the whole process leads him to try to end things decisively by incinerating his dead mother’s coffin.
