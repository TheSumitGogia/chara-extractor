Jewel is the bastard child of Addie and Whitfield, the minister. Though Darl seems to understand him, Jewel remains the novelâ€™s greatest mystery, and is the least represented in its many sections. Jewel has a proud, fiercely independent nature that most of his family and neighbors confuse for selfishness. His passionate, brooding nature, however, reveals a real love and dedication to his mother, and he becomes a fierce protector of her coffin.
