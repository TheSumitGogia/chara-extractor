Vardaman Bundren is the youngest of the Bundren children. Vardaman has a lively imagination, and he views his motherâ€™s death through the same lens with which he views a fish he has recently caught and cleaned. Although his ramblings at the beginning of the novel border on the maniacal, Vardaman proves to be a thoughtful and innocent child.
