George F. Babbitt is Babbitt is a middle-aged successful real estate broker in Zenith. When the novel opens, he is a typical member of Zenith's hypocritical, ignorant, unthinking, conformist middle class. However, he is vaguely dissatisfied with the monotonous, conventional middle-class lifestyle. After his best friend, Paul Riesling, is sent to jail for shooting his wife in an argument, Babbitt briefly rebels against middle-class values. He has an affair, joins his mistress's Bohemian circle of friends, and voices liberal political opinions. However, his friends and associates quickly crush his rebellion by shunning him socially and refusing to do business with him. When Myra Babbitt falls seriously ill, Babbitt realizes that it is too late for him to rebel. He has too much to lose, and he doesn't want his family to suffer for his unorthodox behavior. He returns to his conventional life to regain his social status and respectability with a new understanding of the hypocritical, ignorant values of his class.
