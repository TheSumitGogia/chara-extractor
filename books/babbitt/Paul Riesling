Paul Riesling was Babbitt's college classmate and is his closest friend. When he was young, he wanted to become a professional violinist, but like Babbitt, he became mired in the conventional lifestyle of the middle-class businessman. He is harshly critical of the monotonous, hypocritical character of Zenith's middle class. His wife, Zilla, is equally dissatisfied with this life, but she vents her frustration on Riesling by constantly nagging him. One day, Riesling snaps and shoots her during an argument, for which he is sentenced to three years in prison. The loss of his friend devastates Babbitt, and it prompts him to embark on a rebellion against the middle-class lifestyle.
