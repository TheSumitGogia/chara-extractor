Seneca Doane is a radical lawyer who was one of Babbitt's college classmates. He supports the labor rights movement and unsuccessfully runs against Prout in the Zenith mayoral election. He protests the standardized opinions and values of the middle class. When Babbitt engages in a brief rebellion against those values, he voices support for Doane's political opinions, much to the horror and dismay of his friends.
