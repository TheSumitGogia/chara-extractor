Stanley Graff is a real estate salesman in Babbitt's real estate business. When he becomes engaged, he asks Babbitt for a raise but receives a lecture for his lack of gratitude and business ethics. His low wages force him to cheat some of Babbitt's customers in order to feed himself and his wife. When Babbitt discovers his unethical business practices, he lectures Graff about morals and fires him. Graff points out that Babbitt is in no position to preach morality because he engages in bigger, more unethical practices. He threatens to reveal the details of Babbitt's shady deals if Babbitt tries to prevent him from getting a job in another firm.
