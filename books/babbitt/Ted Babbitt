Ted Babbitt is George and Myra's teenaged son. He doesn't want to go to college because his talents and interests lay in mechanics. Like most middle class boys, he is interested in girls, nice clothing, and expensive cars. At the end of the novel, he drops out of college and elopes with Eunice Littlefield. Because Babbitt now understands that the conventional middle-class lifestyle is extremely repressive, he tells his son to follow his dreams.
