Vergil Gunch is a Zenith coal merchant and one of Babbitt's many friends and associates in the Zenith business community. When Babbitt rebels against the conventional social and political values of Zenith's middle class, Gunch tries to coerce him into conforming by shunning him socially and organizing a boycott of Babbitt's real estate firm through the Good Citizen's League. When Myra falls seriously ill, Gunch once again extends his friendship and support to Babbitt, but it comes with strings attached. Babbitt welcomes the chance to return to the security of conformity.
