Katsumi Hosokawa is the head of a major Japanese electronics firm and an extremely hard worker. Order and diligence characterize Hosokawaâ€™s life, and only when listening to opera does he feel passionately alive. His adoration for the voice of opera singer Roxanne Coss brings him to the poor South American country where the novel is set. There, Hosokawa and Coss fall in love.
