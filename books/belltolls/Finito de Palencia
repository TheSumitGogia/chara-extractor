Finito de Palencia is Pilar’s former lover, a bullfighter who died from complications from wounds received in a bullfight. Short, sad-eyed, and sullen, Finito was brave in the ring in spite of his fear of bulls. Finito, who appears in the novel only in Pilar’s flashbacks, exemplifies the courage of Hemingway’s code hero and Hemingway’s deep respect for the bullfighting profession.
