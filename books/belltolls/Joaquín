Joaquín is One of the members of El Sordo’s band. Joaquín originally wanted to be bullfighter but was too scared. He lost most of his family at the hands of the Fascists and cries when he talks about them. Joaquín buys into the Republicans’ propaganda but turns back to religion at the moment of his death, illustrating the emptiness of political rhetoric in times of true crisis.
