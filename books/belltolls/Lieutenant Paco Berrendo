Lieutenant Paco Berrendo is a devoutly Catholic Fascist officer who orders the beheading of El Sordo’s men. Berrendo’s sorrow for his dead friend, his awareness of the useless horror of war, and his tendency toward introspection make him a sympathetic character. Hemingway’s portrayal of Berrendo underscores the fact that the enemy side is not faceless but composed of real individuals who also make real and difficult decisions.
