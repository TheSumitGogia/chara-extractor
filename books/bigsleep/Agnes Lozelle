Agnes Lozelle is the front girl for Geiger's pornography rentals. Agnes is the equivalent of Brody: she is a common criminal, a grifter in search of a buck. She has an expensive drug addiction that has landed her in a deep hole. Agnes takes up with Brody and then with Harry Jones, both times in schemes to make an easy dollar. She is unhappy with her life, but she does nothing to better herself, instead blaming the men around her.
