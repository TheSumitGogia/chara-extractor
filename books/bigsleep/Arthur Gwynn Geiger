Arthur Gwynn Geiger is a pornographer who runs an illegal smut rental shop under the guise of a rare bookstore. Geiger, who is homosexual (or perhaps bisexual), blackmails General Sternwood, and murdered in the act of attempting to further his blackmail by taking nude pictures of Carmen Sternwood. Though Geiger is murdered early on in the novel, his death causes a series of events that set the plot in motion.
