General Sternwood is the rich and very ill oil baron who has fathered two wild daughters—Vivian and Carmen Sternwood—and who has hired Marlowe as a private detective. Chandler implies that the General has fathered Carmen quite late in life and that his life has wild in its own fashion, and corrupt as well. Nevertheless, we may feel sorry for Sternwood because he seems to have a genuinely sentimental side to him. Although he is aware of his daughters' wild behavior, he is unaware of their true malice, particularly Carmen's. It is General Sternwood that introduces both plot lines—that of Geiger and that of Regan.
