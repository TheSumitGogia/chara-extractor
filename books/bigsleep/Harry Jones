Harry Jones is a man involved in crime, but for whom crime is the wrong business. Indeed, though Harry Jones is bad at criminal activity, he seems to have no other option. He is bad at tailgating, as illustrated by his poor performance in following Marlowe. He plans a moneymaking scheme with Agnes—trading his knowledge of the hiding place of Mona Grant (Eddie Mars's wife) for money—but gets killed before he ever sees the money. Harry is not very smart, but he illustrates a good will when he gives Canino the wrong address and when he protects Agnes, his partner in crime.
