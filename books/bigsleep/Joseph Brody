Joseph Brody is a man who tries to take over Geiger's porn racket. Brody is a common criminal who blackmails and gets involved in any scheme or illegal activity that might make him a dollar. He blackmails Vivian Sternwood with the pictures of Carmen he has in his possession. He is not incredibly smart, and his life seems almost an accident, just like his death, which is a mere misunderstandingâ€”Lundgren thinks it is Brody who has killed Geiger.
