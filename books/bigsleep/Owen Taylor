Owen Taylor is the Sternwoods' chauffeur, a young man. Taylor is in love with Carmen Sternwood, and tries to run away with her, but is jailed because Vivian, Carmen's sister, presses charges. The only way Taylor can see to save Carmen and her name is to murder Geiger. Not very much is known about Taylor, as his is the only death in the novel that remains ambiguous—whether he commits suicide or is killed is unclear. Because we do not know the nature of his death, we do not know how he feels about the murder he commits. Regardless, Taylor is one of the two characters in the novel—Carol Lundgren being the other—who "kill for love."
