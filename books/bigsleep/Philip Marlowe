Philip Marlowe is the novel's protagonist and in many ways its modern "knight." Marlowe is a private detective who is asked to deal with a blackmailing case for the wealthy General Sternwood. Although he is apparently attractive to women, he is not prone to take advantage of them, and he remains respectful in his own hard- boiled way. Marlowe is a man of the streets, tough and clever, but he is honest and good-willed. Other characters even call him na√Øve in several instances. His dialogue and manner of speaking are particularly raw and witty, often brash. A good judge of human character, he is perfect for his line of work.Read anin-depth analysis of Philip Marlowe.
