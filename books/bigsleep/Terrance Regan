Terrance Regan is an ex-bootlegger and husband of Vivian Sternwood. Regan is somewhat of a phantom character: we never meet him because he is dead long before the narrative begins. He remains, however, one of the novel's main characters in the sense that much of the novel revolves around him and the search for him. General Sternwood wants Regan found because he had been a good friend to the General, sweating with him in the greenhouse many a day, providing conversation to a sick and dying man. In the end, Regan is one of the very few characters who is saved from the plight of the novel and its aftermathâ€”he exists only in a long sleep, "the big sleep," far away from the everyday reality of a seedy Los Angeles.
