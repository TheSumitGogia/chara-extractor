Alan is Richard’s younger brother. Born Leon Alan Wright, he goes by the name Alan. Alan does not contribute much to the story ofBlack Boy: a few times, he limply objects to something naughty that Richard is planning to do, like burn straws in a fireplace or hang a kitten. In this sense, he serves as one of Richard’s critics.
