P.D. East is the editor of a newspaper in a small Mississippi town. Like Griffin, East is a passionate advocate for racial equality in America. East's family is ostracized as a result of his stance, and his newspaper is a financial disaster. But he is an inspiration to Griffin, who sees him as a sign of goodness flourishing amid the evil of racism and segregation.
