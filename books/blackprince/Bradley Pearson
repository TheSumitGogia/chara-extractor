Bradley Pearson is the protagonist and the author of the novel. Bradley is the novel's most fully developed character and also the one who changes the most within it. Bradley starts the book as a cold and occasionally cruel character. He treats Francis and Christian with blunt rudeness. He ignores his very depressed sister, Priscilla, and it is his neglect, in part, that leads to her suicide. In the beginning of the novel, Bradley acts only with self-interest, but after his experience of love he changes into a content, more generous creature, who is finally able to write a master novel.
