Francis Marloe is Christian's brother and Bradley Pearson's ex-brother-in-law. Francis is a comic character who exists for other characters and readers to laugh at. Francis's comic nature comes from his pitiful physical condition and his constantly groveling behavior. Furthermore, the way that the other characters verbally abuse Francis provides comic effect, in a slapstick manner. Francis basically is a kind man who wants to treat other people kindly, but his constant fumbling makes it difficult to fully respect and sympathize with him. For example, Francis wants to help Priscilla, but leaves her for the whole night to go get drunk with Bradley's homosexual neighbor, during which time she kills herself. The foolishness of Francis's behavior is characteristic of his way and is one of the reasons that he fits the role of the buffoon in the novel.Read anin-depth analysis of Francis Marloe.
