P. Loxias is the editor of the novel. "Loxias" is a pseudonym for Apollo, the Greek god of the Arts. The prophetess Cassandra refers to Apollo as "Loxias" in Aeschylus'sThe Oresteia.Loxias is not truly a developed character in the novel, as he only serves to provide a foreword and postscript. His primary role is to alert the readers to the primary theme of the book: the importance of art in articulating truth. Since Apollo is the God of Arts, it seems appropriate that he is the one to supervise a novel that debates its relative merits.
