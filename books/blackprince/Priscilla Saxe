Priscilla Saxe is the sister of Bradley Pearson. Priscilla is a sympathetic, but pitiful woman who spends the majority of the book moaning about the ruined state of her life. Priscilla's life, it appears, is somewhat ruined, since she spent most of it in an unloving marriage. Her painful experience testifies to the difficulties of life as well as the specific difficulties of being a woman. Priscilla's great regret is the abortion that left her unable to have children. Priscilla's sadness helps to establish Bradley's coldness as a character, because, despite her needs, he basically ignores her.
