Rachel Baffin is the wife of Arnold Baffin. Rachel is a forceful woman whom both Arnold and Bradley underestimate. Arnold seems to think that all is well between him and his wife; Bradley regards Rachel as a benign, older woman. Rachel's firm speech and unforgiving tone, however, suggests the power within her personality, even if the other characters cannot see it. Rachel herself predicts her fierceness when she tells Bradley that she still has "real fire" in her. Despite Rachel's fierceness, she is also a sympathetic character who also helps to articulate the difficulties of being a middle-aged housewife.
