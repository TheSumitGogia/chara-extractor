Ahmed’s Father is an esteemed engineer and native Egyptian. Ahmed’s father’s life changes when he decides to oppose Prime Minister and President Nasser’s plan to build the High Dam. Ahmed’s father has legitimate environmental concerns, but his opposition costs him dearly, as he is persecuted by the government for the rest of his life. In her father, Ahmed also sees the roots of “colonial consciousness,” an acceptance or even reverence for the culture of the oppressor.
