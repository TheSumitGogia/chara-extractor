Samia is Ahmed’s cousin, four years her senior. Samia visits Ain Shams, Ahmed’s home in Cairo, and spends hours discussing her love life with Ahmed’s mother. Ahmed is perhaps envious of this relationship, one in which her mother offers wise and even-handed advice. If Samia were her own daughter, Ahmed’s mother would, Ahmed is certain, be more judgmental.
