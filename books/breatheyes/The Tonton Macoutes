The Tonton Macoutes is Creole for "Uncle Bogeyman." Refers to the private militia first conscripted under Francois Duvalier, Haitian president from 1957–1971, and formally known as the VSN (Volontaires de la SÃ©curite Nationale). They are widely feared as torturers, assassins and agents of arbitrary cruelty.
