Basil Michael is Mattie’s only son. Basil is the center of Mattie’s life from the moment of his birth and grows up under her watchful and loving eye. He is unable to accept any responsibility for his actions, and, as an adult, he kills a man in a fight. While out on bail, he selfishly decides to flee and forfeit his mother’s house rather than risk even the slim chance of going to jail.
