Man in the Tree Lot is a gruff but warmhearted man, he feels bad chucking the tree at Francie and Neeley. Like many characters in Brooklyn, his rough speech and curses are meant to be taken kindly. Like many proprietors in Francie's neighborhood, he reluctantly takes advantage of kids in order to feed his own.
