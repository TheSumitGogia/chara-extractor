Liza Khokhlakov is (Lise) Madame Khokhlakovâ€™s daughter, a mischievous and capricious young girl who is briefly engaged to Alyosha. At least as shallow and self-centered as her mother, Lise has a hard time taking things seriously and finally lapses into a kind of self-destructive despair, in which she pathetically crushes her fingernail in a door in an attempt to punish herself for wickedness.
