Captain De Vriess is the first captain of theCaineunder whom Willie serves, he is probably the best captain to command the ship. With only an abbreviated understanding of how the Navy and ships like theCainerun, he emphasizes performance, not appearance. He makes a very accurate assessment of Willie to Keefer early in the book, saying that though Willie needs conditioning, he will turn into a competent officer. De Vriess is well liked by the crew, who present him with a silver watch upon his departure from the ship.
