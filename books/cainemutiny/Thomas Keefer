A scholar in a band of idiots, Thomas Keefer is the antihero ofThe Caine Mutiny, despite all of his admirable qualities. Some consider him an extremely competent officer, but he has a terrible attitude toward the service, and carries out his duties badly. When Keefer is trusted with the role of captain, he proves to be just as bad as Queeg. Also, the novel that Keefer cites as his true passion, though it will sell plenty of copies, has no real literary merit, despite the extent of his reading and knowledge.
