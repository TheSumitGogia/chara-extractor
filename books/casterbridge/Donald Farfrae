Donald Farfrae is the Scotchman who arrives in Casterbridge at the same time as Susan Henchard and Elizabeth-Jane. Farfrae’s business efficiency, good humor, and polish make him extremely popular among the town’s citizens. These same qualities, however, eventually make him Henchard’s rival. Despite this tension in their friendship, Farfrae remains fair-minded, patient, and even kind in his dealings with the ruined Henchard.
