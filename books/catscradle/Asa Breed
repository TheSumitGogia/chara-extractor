Asa Breed was Felix's supervisor at the Research Laboratory where Felix helped develop the atomic bomb. John interviewed him when he was researching his book,The Day the World Ended,which was never finished. Asa took offense at John's questions because he felt that John believed scientists were heartlessly indifferent to humankind. He told John about Felix's attempts to createice-nine.When John nervously asked if Felix had succeeded, Asa denied it and furiously ended the interview.
