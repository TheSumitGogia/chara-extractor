Felix Hoenikker was a key researcher in the development of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. When John began researching the Hoenikker family, he quickly learned that Felix cared little for human responsibilities. Felix approached his work as if it were an amusing game, regardless of the content of the research. Felix was emotionally indifferent to other people, including his family, simply because people were not his "specialty." When a marine general asked him to solve the problem of mud, Felix began working on the creation of an isotope of water, which he calledice-nine,that was solid at room temperature. Unfortunately, Felix succeeded in creatingice-nine,but he kept no records of his research. After his death, his three children, Angela, Newt, and Frank, secretly divided his creation among themselves.
