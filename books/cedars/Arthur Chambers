Arthur Chambers is Ishmael’s father. Arthur founded and edited the San Piedro Review, the most prominent newspaper on the island. Arthur frequently—and courageously—used the editorial column in his newspaper as a forum to condemn the racism directed at San Piedro’s Japanese-American residents during World War II. Though his editorials often provoked hostility from much of the community, Arthur maintained a strong heart and firmly believed that his perspective was the correct one.
