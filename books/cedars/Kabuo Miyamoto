Kabuo Miyamoto is the Japanese-American fisherman who stands trial for the alleged murder of Carl Heine. When Kabuo was a boy, his family worked as sharecroppers on the strawberry farm owned by Carl Heine, Sr. Like his father, Zenhichi, Kabuo is a master at kendo, the Japanese art of stick fighting. Kabuo considers himself a murderer because he killed enemy soldiers in World War II, in which he fought for the United States Army. Since the war, Kabuo has been consumed with his dream to repurchase his familyâ€™s land.
