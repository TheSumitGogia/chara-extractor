Mrs. Shigemura is Hatsueâ€™s teacher. When Hatsue was thirteen, her parents sent her to Mrs. Shigemura for training in social graces. Mrs. Shigemura told Hatsue to avoid white men and their bizarre fetishes for Japanese girls and advised Hatsue to marry a good Japanese man. She thus represents the old school of Japanese values.
