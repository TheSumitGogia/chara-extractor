Ali Kondey is Esi’s second husband and the managing director of Linga HideAway Travel. Ali is a very handsome and well-educated man.

He happily claims several different nationalities as his own, and he spends much of his life traveling from one part of the world to another. He grows up and marries his childhood friend and first love, Fusena. Drawn to Esi’s beauty and independence, he takes her as a second wife but quickly begins to spend less and less time with her.

Ali continues his multiple affairs throughout his marriage to Esi.Read anin-depth analysis of Ali Kondey.
