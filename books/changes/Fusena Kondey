Fusena Kondey is Ali’s first wife. Fusena has known Ali since they were young children. Following her marriage to Ali and the birth of her first child, Fusena abandons her career and education. She longs to finish school and get her degree but is constantly held back by Ali, who insists that he can earn enough money to support the family. She tries to resist Ali’s desire for a second marriage but is eventually coaxed into it by the elder women of Ali’s family. She is resentful of the fact that Ali has chosen a woman with a university degree to be his second wife, given that he prevented her from completing her degree. She is a somewhat tragic figure in that she has sacrificed her independence and career for a husband who not only takes a second wife but also continues to have multiple affairs with numerous other women.
