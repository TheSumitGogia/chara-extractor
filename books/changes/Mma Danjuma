Mma Danjuma is the sister of Ali’s father. Following the death of Ali’s mother, Mma Danjuma raises Ali as her own son. She advocates for him to be educated in the French schools and plays a critical role in arranging Ali’s marriage to Fusena. Although she is initially resistant to Ali taking Esi as a second wife, she is eventually able to accept Esi (to a limited degree).
