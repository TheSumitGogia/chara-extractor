Ogyaanowa Sekyi is the daughter of Esi and Oko. As a young child, Ogyaanowa is caught in the middle of her parents’ frequent fights and eventual divorce. These experiences will clearly haunt her later in life. She is shuffled back and forth between her parents, but she is primarily raised by her father and her father’s mother. Although she loves her mother, she is clearly much more comfortable spending time at her grandmother’s house than in the empty home where her mother lives.
