Arthur Hayes is a fat man with a Southern accent. Arthur overlooks Hookset from his cage-like fire escape. Arnold refers to Adam as "honey" while reluctantly giving him information about his stolen bike. He is ordered around by another man inside his apartment, and is distressed that he never gets to do anything. Adam feels sorry for Arthur, whom he sees as trapped in a prison due to his obesity and his situation.
