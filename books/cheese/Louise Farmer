Louise Farmer is Adam's mother. Louise is kind, compassionate, and protective. Adam is delighted whenever she makes him chocolate desserts. Ever since the family moved to Monument she has been withdrawn, and closes herself off in her room. She does not have friends, nor does she go to PTA meetings like other women in the community. She lives her life in fear of the "Never Knows"mdash;the state of never knowing whom to trust or what will happen next.
