Carolina Maria de Jesus is the author of, and central player in, the diary. Carolina, forty-one years old and the mother of three young children, lives in a favela, or slum,in Brazil. She collects paper scraps to sell in order to buy food and writes in her diary about daily life. In contrast to the other women of the favela, Carolina does not drink, engage in fighting, or otherwise compromise the safety of her children. She has also resolved not to marry. Perceptive, critical, and sometimes dryly humorous, Carolina creates an accurate record of life in the favela.
