João is Carolina’s oldest son. João is eight when the diary begins. When a neighbor accuses him of raping her daughter midway through the diary, he is interrogated by the local authorities, who ask prying questions in front of his brother and sister about his knowledge of sex. Nothing comes of the charges by the end of the book.
