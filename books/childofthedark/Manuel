Manuel is Carolina’s long-time lover. Manuel appears to be better than the favelados: he doesn’t drink, he works, and he dresses and behaves like a man of a much higher station. Manuel would like to marry Carolina, but her feelings about him fluctuate. On one hand, she thinks very highly of him and has obvious affection for him, though she is fundamentally resistant to the idea of marrying anyone. Manuel grows jealous of Carolina’s relationship with the gypsy Raimundo, though he comes back to her, as she predicts.
