Orlando Lopes is a man who lives and works in the favela. Orlando is sometimes helpful to Carolina, as when he helps her slaughter a pig, but he is also corrupt. In charge of electricity in the favela, he collects electrical deposits even thought the electric company abolished such deposits years ago. Orlando also reacts negatively to Carolina’s publication and the fact that she accused him of being lazy in her account—he shuts off her electricity for nonpayment of the dubious fees.
