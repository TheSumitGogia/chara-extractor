Jerry Renault is the protagonist of the story. Jerry decides that he dares to disturb the universe. He single-handedly takes on the biggest bullies in schoolâ€”both a gang of kids and a crooked teacher. Jerry does not complain or rat on the people making his life hell. Rather, he deals with them quietly, with his own silent protest. He is an admirable character that shows strength and individualism, but in the end pays for those qualities.
