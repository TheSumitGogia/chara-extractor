David Malter is a traditional Orthodox Jew and a teacher, scholar, writer, and humanitarian. Mr. Malter raises his son, Reuven, to be an ethical, caring, and intellectually honest young man, well-versed in both Judaic and secular studies. Mr. Malter is notorious within the Hasidic community for his controversial Biblical scholarship and his outspoken support of Zionism. His health deteriorates as the novel progresses due to his tireless hard work on behalf of the Zionist movement. He wants Reuven to become a mathematics professor, but once he realizes his son is dedicated to becoming a rabbi, he fully supports Reuvenâ€™s decision. Throughout the book, he encourages the intellectual curiosity of both his son and Danny Saunders.
