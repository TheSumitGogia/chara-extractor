Mr. Galanter is the gym instructor at Reuven’s yeshiva. Mr. Galanter leads Reuven’s high school softball team and brings Reuven to the hospital after his eye injury. He speaks to his team using military metaphors, and the boys wonder why he is not fighting in World War II. Mr. Galanter later tells Reuven that he “couldn’t make it as a soldier,” but he never elaborates.
