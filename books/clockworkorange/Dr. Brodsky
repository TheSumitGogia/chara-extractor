Dr. Brodsky is the State-employed behavioral scientist in charge of administering Ludovico’s Technique to Alex. Brodsky is short, fat, and hairy, with thick glasses and a rather sadistic temperament. He often laughs at Alex’s suffering. Unlike Alex, he knows nothing of classical music, except that it proves useful for intensifying Alex’s emotions during the administration of the technique. He also demonstrates a warped sense of morality by calling Alex “a true Christian” after Alex loses his ability to make his own moral choices.
