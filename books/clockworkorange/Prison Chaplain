Prison Chaplain is the resident priest of Staja 84F, Alexâ€™s prison. The chaplain (or charlie, in prison slang) is a big, burly drunk with a red face. He preaches to the prisoners about morals, but his career ambitions lead him to rationalize the treatment that Alex receives at the hands of the government. He gives the most concise expression of the importance of free will in the novel.
