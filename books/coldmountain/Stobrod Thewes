Stobrod Thewes is Ruby’s father. Despite his drunk and disreputable past, Stobrod partially redeems himself through music. He delights in composing and performing his own fiddle tunes. As an outlier living in a cave on Cold Mountain, Stobrod looks to his daughter for help in evading the Home Guard. Even when down on his luck, Stobrod always manages to pull through, as evidenced by his narrow brush with death at the hands of Teague’s men.
