Appearing briefly, but on two separate occasions in the novel, the widow keeps Crusoeâ€™s200pounds safe in England throughout all his thirty-five years of journeying. She returns it loyally to Crusoe upon his return to England and, like the Portuguese captain and Friday, reminds us of the goodwill and trustworthiness of which humans can be capable, whether European  or not.
