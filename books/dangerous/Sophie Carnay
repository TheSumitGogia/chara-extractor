Sophie Carnay is a friend Cécile made during the time she was in the convent. Sophie continues to live among the nuns, though she is able to take time out to write to Cécile from time to time. Sophie's letters are not included in the novel, but we can imagine that they contain plenty of warnings and advice, the work of a traditional, devout, and extremely naïve, young girl.
