Silas is a monk of Opus Dei, and the murderer of Jacques Sauni√®re. Silas, an albino, is motivated by the rejection and horror he has faced since he was young. When he falls into the orbit of Bishop Aringarosa, he finds religion and devotes himself to the strict Catholic ways of Opus Dei. He is obsessed with self-punishment and celibacy, and his goal in life is to aid  the Bishop and Opus Dei.
