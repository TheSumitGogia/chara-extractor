Knauer is a student who seeks out Sinclair for intellectual guidance toward the end of Sinclair's time at preparatory school. Sinclair seems to find him mostly annoying and their interaction does not go very far. He is interesting because he tries to make Sinclair his mentor. Sinclair, however, is used to being the one who is mentored and is unable to make this role reversal.
