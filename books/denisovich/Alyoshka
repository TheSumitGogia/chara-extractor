Alyoshka is a prisoner with a bunk that neighbors Shukhov’s. Alyoshka is a devout Baptist who reads late at night in the notebook into which he has copied half of the New Testament. Alyoshka is known for doing favors for other inmates but never expecting or receiving rewards for these favors. By the end of the novel, Shukhov begins to respect Alyoshka’s naïve goodwill, faith, and disdain of worldly goods.
