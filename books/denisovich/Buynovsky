Buynovsky is a prisoner known familiarly throughout the novel as “the captain” for his former military rank. In the prison camp, Buynovsky is no more privileged than Shukhov. He is well-educated, as demonstrated by his theoretical discussions with Tsezar about Russian films. But his culture is of little service to him in the camp, as the only thing that truly matters is survival.
