Ivan Denisovich Shukhov is an inmate of a Stalinst labor camp somewhere in Siberia in1951. Shukhov is the novelâ€™s protagonist. He is a working-class, somewhat uneducated man, and his daily struggle represents that of the average Russian citizen. He believes in God but is not religious. His conversation with Alyoshka at the end of the novel, however, shows that he may experience a turn to spirituality, when for the first time he does someone a favor without hope of payback.
