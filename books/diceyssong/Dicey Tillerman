Dicey Tillerman is the novel's protagonist. Dicey is a tough, capable, and fiercely independent girl who is deeply loyal to and protective of her family members. Dicey, who is thirteen, resents school and the entire world of social conventions, and thus reflexively shuns friendships, choosing instead to devote her time to her job and to refurbishing an old sailboat in her grandmother's barn. Throughout the novel, Dicey struggles to come to terms with the illness and eventual death of her mother, and these events are part of Dicey's instruction in opening up to the world around her.
