James Tillerman is Dicey's ten year old brother. James is a serious and cerebral boy who has always been an outsider despite his desire to be liked. James often frustrates Dicey with his abstract and philosophical musings, and he tends to forget the needs of others or to lose sight of right and wrong in the interest of serving his own ends. At the same time, James' seriousness and intelligence help the family confront many of their problems.
