The leader of the pack of wild dogs that lives on Ghalas-at, Rontu was brought to the island by the Aleuts. Unlike the other dogs, which have brown fur and brown eyes, Rontu has yellow eyes and gray fur (he is also much larger than the average dog of the island). Though Rontu and Karana are enemies at the beginning of the novel, they become friends after Karana injures Rontu and then nurses him back to health.
