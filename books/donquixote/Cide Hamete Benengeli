Cide Hamete Benengeli is the fictional writer of Moorish decent from whose manuscripts Cervantes supposedly translates the novel. Cervantes uses the figure of Benengeli to comment on the ideas of authorship and literature explored in the novel and to critique historians. Benengeliâ€™s opinions, bound in his so-called historical text, show his contempt for those who write about chivalry falsely and with embellishment.
