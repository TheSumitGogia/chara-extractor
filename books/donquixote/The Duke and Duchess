The Duke and Duchess is the cruel and haughty contrivers of the adventures that occupy Don Quixote for the majority of the novelâ€™s Second Part. Bored and snobby, the Duke and Duchess feign interest in Don Quixote and Sancho but continually play pranks on them for their personal entertainment. The Duke and Duchess spend so much money and effort on their ploys that they seem as mad as Don Quixote.
