Adam Trask is the son of Cyrus Trask and the father of Aron and Cal. Adam is a goodhearted but somewhat impractical man, and his innocence leads him to fall in love with the novel’s most evil character, Cathy Ames. In the novel’s retelling of the biblical story of Cain and Abel, Adam plays the Abel role in the first generation of the Trask family; in the second generation, he plays the Adam role befitting his name. Adam’s benediction to Cal at the end of the novel validatestimshel,the idea that individuals are free to choose their own moral paths.
