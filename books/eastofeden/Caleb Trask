Caleb Trask is the son of Adam and Cathy and the twin brother of Aron. Cal is a manipulative, tempestuous boy who is fiercely jealous of his more likable brother, Aron. Cal struggles throughout the second half of the novel to control his temptations and to lead a moral life. Ultimately, he accepts the idea oftimshel,that every individual is free to choose his own moral path in life. This acceptance enables Cal to overcome his fear that his mother’s evil has been passed down to him. At the end of the novel, Cal is the character who most directly embodies this central idea oftimshel.Cal plays the Cain role in the second generation of the Trask family, indirectly killing Aron (the corresponding Abel) by revealing to Aron that their mother is a prostitute, which leads Aron to join the army and die in World War I. When his father confronts him about Aron’s whereabouts, Cal sneers, “Am I supposed to look after  him?”—an echo of Cain’s famous retort to God, “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
