Cyrus Trask is the patriarch of the Trask family and the father of Adam and Charles. The imposing Cyrus lies so convincingly about his military heroics during the Civil War that the government appoints him to a powerful position in the Army administration. In fact, Cyrus was wounded in the very first hour of his battlefield experience in the Civil War and lost his leg to amputation. Cyrus leaves his (probably stolen) fortune of more than $100,000to his sons.
