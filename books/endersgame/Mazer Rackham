Mazer Rackham is Ender's last teacher, Rackham makes no attempt to become Ender's friend, although, like Graff, he loves and respects the boy. Rackham is forced to deceive Ender into thinking he is playing mere games and explains to him that no one but a child could have won the warâ€”it took both compassion, daring, and ruthlessness that he himself could not have had since he knew it was not a game.
