Hana is a young Canadian who serves the Allies as a nurse in World War II. Only twenty years old, Hana is an excellent nurse who takes good care of her patients. She has quickly learned that she must not become emotionally attached to her patients, as she has seen too many young soldiers slip out of her life. Very close to her father, Hana had an emotional breakdown when she heard the news of his death.

Her heart, however, belongs to Kip, to whom she looks for protection as she stands at the boundary between adolescence and adulthood.Read anin-depth analysis of Hana.
