Madox is Alm치sy's best friend in the desert. Madox is a rational, level-headed man who, like Alm치sy, chose to live in the desert to study the features of the land and report back to the Geographical Society. Unlike Alm치sy, Madox includes his own emotional reactions in his writing and reports, and is not shy to describe his amazement at a particular mountain or his wonder at the size of the moon. Madox always carries a copy ofAnna Karenina,the famous tale of adultery, but remains ever faithful to his wife back home. Madox sees the church as proclaiming a jingoistic pro-war message during World War II. He takes his own life in the church, and Alm치sy concludes that he "died because of nations."
