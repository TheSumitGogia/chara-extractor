Helen Ferguson is a nurse’s aide who works at the American hospital and a dear friend of Catherine. Though  Helen is friendly and accepting of Henry and Rinaldi’s visits to Catherine early in the novel, her hysterical outburst over Henry and Catherine’s “immoral”  affair establishes her as an unhappy woman who is paranoid about her friend’s safety and anxious about her own loneliness.
