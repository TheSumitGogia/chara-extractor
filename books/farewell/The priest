The priest is a kind, sweet, young man who provides spiritual guidance to the few soldiers interested in it. Often the butt of the officers’ jokes, the priest responds with good-natured understanding. Through Henry’s conversations with him regarding the war, the  novel challenges abstract ideals like glory, honor,  and sacredness.
