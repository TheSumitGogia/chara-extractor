Elrond Halfelven is the Master of Rivendell. Elrond is descended from a Man and an Elf—thus, “Halfelven.” He had the choice to be mortal or immortal and chose the latter. As a consequence, Elrond must leave Middle-earth when the time comes, most likely at the end of the War of the Ring. He is renowned for his wisdom and learning.
