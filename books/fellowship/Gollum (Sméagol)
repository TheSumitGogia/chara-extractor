Gollum (Sméagol) is a hunched, miserable creature who was once Sméagol, a young boy of a Hobbit-like race. Sméagol killed his friend Déagol after Déagol found the One Ring on the bottom of the Anduin River. The Ring corrupted Sméagol and changed him into his current form, the creature called Gollum. Gollum maintained possession of the Ring until he lost in it in his caves in the Misty Mountains, where Bilbo recovered it.
