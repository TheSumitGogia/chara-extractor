Orcs is Squat, swarthy, wretched creatures that are seemingly limitless in number and that serve the purposes of Sauron. Hordes of Orcs, which are unable to withstand daylight and therefore emerge almost exclusively at night, pursue the Fellowship through the Mines of Moria and beyond; it is presumed that the Orcs are also responsible for the death of Balin and the other Dwarves who returned to Moria in an attempt to reclaim the ancient Dwarf realm there.
