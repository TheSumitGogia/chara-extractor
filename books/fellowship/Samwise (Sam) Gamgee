Samwise (Sam) Gamgee is the former gardener at Bag End and Frodoâ€™s indomitable servant throughout his quest. Although Sam is not extraordinarily wise or intelligent, his common sense and powers of observation serve him well. Perhaps most important, he is stubborn, brave, and deeply loyal to Frodo.
