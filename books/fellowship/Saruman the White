Saruman the White is the head of Gandalf’s order of Wizards. Saruman advises the other Wizards not to challenge the growing power of Sauron. Gandalf, who suspects that Saruman intends to join Sauron’s forces outright, confirms his suspicions when he travels to Saruman’s tower, Orthanc. Saruman does not himself appear as a character untilThe Two Towers,but his presence and influence are clearly felt inThe Fellowship of the Ring.
