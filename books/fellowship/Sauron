Sauron is the antagonist and title character ofThe Lord of the Rings.The Dark Lord Sauron, a servant of Morgoth, the Great Enemy, took his master’s place after the First Age. The enormously powerful Sauron is never seen at any point in the novel; he is represented only by images of his Great Eye or the Dark Tower where he resides. He fervently desires the One Ring, which he created long ago and which holds a great part of his power. Sauron is wise, but he only thinks in terms of desire—especially desire for power. He therefore does not understand those who would want to destroy the Ring rather than use it—which is perhaps his only weakness.
