The Balrog is a mysterious, gigantic, terrifying elemental demon from deep inside the earth. The Balrog, the “nameless fear” awakened by the Dwarves in the Mines of Moria, emerges from the depths when the Fellowship passes through the Mines, and it ultimately confronts Gandalf in an epic battle. The Balrog, which brandishes an enormous flaming sword and whip, is wreathed in flame and yet exudes shadow and darkness.
