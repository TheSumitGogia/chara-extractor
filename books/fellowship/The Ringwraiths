The Ringwraiths is Nine minions of Sauron who ceaselessly search for the One Ring. The Ringwraiths—also known as the Black Riders, the Nine, or the Nazgûl (the Elvish term)—take the form of cloaked riders on terrifying black horses. They pursue Frodo incessantly, and are especially drawn to him at any moments when he puts the Ring on his finger.
