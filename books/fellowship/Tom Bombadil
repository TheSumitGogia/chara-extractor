Tom Bombadil is a jovial, mysterious, and powerful being who dances around his small realm, singing songs in doggerel. Tom is extremely old, perhaps immortal, and his origins are unknown. He has great power and is deeply connected to the earth, but he is unconcerned with the world outside his realm.
