Dominique Francon is Daughter of the prestigious architect Guy Francon, her fragile appearance, pale gold hair, and gray eyes belie her capability and bluntness. Dispassionate, cynical, and cold, Dominique nurses a masochistic streak. Although she loves Roark and his beliefs, she initially tries to destroy him before the rest of the world can. Eventually, to punish herself for her behavior, she marries Peter Keating and then Gail Wynand.
