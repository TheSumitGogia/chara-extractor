Henry Cameron is Roark’s mentor, an intractable and aggressive architect who is in the twilight of his career at the onset of the novel. Like Roark, Cameron suffers greatly at the hands of the world because he loves his buildings, but he does not have Roark’s strength and lives a frustrated and anguished life. Ruined physically and financially, Cameron dies still fighting the world.
