Buddy Glass is the narrator who claims to have authored the "Zooey" section, Buddy is the second-oldest Glass child. At the time in which he narrates the story, however, Buddy is the oldest remaining Glass child, since Seymour committed suicide several years prior. Buddy claims to be guilty of perhaps excess religious coaching of Franny and Zooey. Buddy is a writer and a teacher at a remote college. Many parallels can be drawn between the character of Buddy and J. D. Salinger himself.
