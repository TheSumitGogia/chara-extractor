Bea Marshall is Partial owner of the Marshall Plantation. Bea is married to Jack Marshall. Bea Marshall also is an old and ineffectual representative of the old plantation order. Like her husband, she spends most of her days drunk. She cares little for her niece and for the people who work in her plantation. In the opening scene, she searches in the weeds for pecans under a tree, which seems an accurate metaphor for how clueless she is to what is truly happening in the world. She too seems an appropriate useless mistress for a deteriorating Southern plantation.
