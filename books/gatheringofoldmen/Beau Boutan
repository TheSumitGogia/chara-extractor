Beau Boutan is the Cajun farmer who leases the Marshall Plantation and who is killed right before the action begins. Because he is dead for most of the novel, his role is largely symbolic. Beau represents all white men who perpetuated violence against blacks. Beau's murder, similarly, represents the murder that many of the persecuted blacks may have fantasized about. Beau's connection to the agricultural transformation of the Marshall Plantation also makes him a symbol of the detrimental shift in local economic patterns.
