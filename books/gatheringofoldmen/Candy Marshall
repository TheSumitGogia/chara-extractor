Candy Marshall is Partial owner of the Marshall Plantation. Candy organizes the events in the novel after she learns of the murder of Beau Bauton. She appears to be close friends with the blacks on the plantation, but actually possesses a form of benevolent racism consistent with her high social class. Although she appears headstrong and spunky when she confesses to Beau's murder, she actually is blind in many ways. The man that she believes committed the crime, Mathu, did not do it. With her unwillingness to let Mathu handle the situation, Candy restricts his freedom and humanity. Still Candy is generally a good figure, who represents the possibility of a future for the plantation. By the end of the novel, she has grown more self-realized and lost some of her tacitly racist ways.
