Griffin is the deputy who Mapes brings to the plantation. Griffin is a comic figure who fears the old black man. He also maintains allegiance with the ways of the Old South by refusing to fight against Luke Will because he is white and argues that the old black men should be made to shut up. Griffin's adherence to racist ideas despite his youth suggests the unlikelihood of rapid racial harmony in the South.
