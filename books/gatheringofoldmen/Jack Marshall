Jack Marshall is Part owner of the Marshall plantation. Jack is drunk during the entire novel and says little. He represents the obsolescent order of plantation owners. He is ineffectual, usually intoxicated, and generally disinterested. His drinking might arise from his guilt over his family's slave owning past, but his inactivity suggests his lack of interest in making any effort to redefine his self. Furthermore, while his family's identity may disgust him, Jack clings to it with his snobbery. Jack is a useless ineffectual figure who appropriately owns deteriorating ineffectual plantation.
