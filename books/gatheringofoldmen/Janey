Janey is the servant of the Marshall House. She fits into the classic role of a "house Negro," a role that has existed and been pointed out since the times of slavery. Janey maintains allegiance to more subservient ideas of race. For example, she tells Snookum to refer to the whites with "Miss" or "Mr" and refuses to let him in the front yard. Like the other residents of the Marshall House, Janey exists in the past social structure of plantation times. She clings to their ideas of the world, which are outdated.
