Lou Dimes is Candy's boyfriend. Lou is the most frequent narrator in the novel. He works as a journalist in Baton Rouge and his style is detached and observant. In addition to being a narrator, Lou also is the representative of a new Southern male. Lou wants to marry Candy, who represents the plantation world, but he is an educated city journalist who does not entirely fit in at the plantation. Both Sheriff Mapes and Miss Merle question Lou's manhood when he fails to control and quiet Candy down. Lou's relatively liberal view on her behavior differs from the older Southern masculinity that dominated women as well as land and blacks. Lou's unique masculinity represents the changing times.
