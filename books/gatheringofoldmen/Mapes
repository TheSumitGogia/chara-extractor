Mapes is the Sheriff of Bayonne. Mapes is a complex character who is likeable in some ways, but whose techniques are outdated. Mapes relies about the use of violence to interrogate the old black men, a technique that is unnecessary and harsh. Mapes belongs to an older order of Southern men who did define their manhood by their ability to subjugate another. In this way, his time has past. Still, in some ways the Sheriff eludes the concept of race in his friendship with Mathu. Sheriff Mapes respects Mathu's manhood and therefore has gone fishing with him. The Sheriff's willingness to interact with a black man, shows is willing to live outside of the concept of race. Similarly, the Sheriff listens to the narratives of the older black men without complaint and shows no preference for whites in the final battle. In many ways, Sheriff Mapes is a likable character, but his techniques suggest that he is stuck in an earlier Southern era.Read anin-depth analysis of Mapes.
