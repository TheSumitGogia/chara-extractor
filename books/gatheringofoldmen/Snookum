Snookum is the sole male child described during the novel. His youth and freshness stands in contrast to the old men that surround him. Snookum is curious, disobedient, and questioning. He represents the generation of black males that is to come in the future. His attitudes toward the whites and toward masculinity will be greatly different from those of his elders. The display of brave masculinity shown by the older black men in the novel will teach Snookum lessons of manhood that few Southern blacks have been able to learn before him. Snookum represents the future and the change that will come with the future.
