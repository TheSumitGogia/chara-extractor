Sully is a football player from Louisiana State, who accompanies Gil Boutan back to his home and reports on the events there. Sully is of an Irish background, an important distinction that allows him to be a more objective narrator. Sully is also an educated narrator who compares the scene at the Marshall Plantation to the Twilight Zone. This comparison reminds us that Sully is addicted to television, but also highlights the new dimension of reality that is beginning to exist in the world.
