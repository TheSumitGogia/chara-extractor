Tee Jack is One of the narrators and the owner of a local bar/corner store. Tee Jack's primary concern is pleasing his customers. Tee Jack may not be a deep racist at heart, but his unwillingness to counter the racist ideas voiced in his bar make him a tacit accomplice in the crimes that they commit. Tee Jack represents the quiet acceptance of racist values in the South and the difficulty of complete social change.
