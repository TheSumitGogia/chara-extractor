Jakob Engstrand is a carpenter with a deformed leg, Jakob married Johanna when she was pregnant with Captain Alving's child. The daughter was Regina. At the start of the play, he is working on the orphan asylum meant to memorialize Captain Alving. He wants to use the money he is saving to open an "establishment" for sailors. When speaking to Pastor Manders, whom the hypocritical Jakob always tries to please, he describes the establishment as a place to reform sailors. But when he describes it to Regina, it sounds like a high-class saloon. He is an alcoholic.
