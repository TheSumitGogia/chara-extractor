Regina Engstrand is Regina is Mrs. Alving's maidservant. She is believed to be the daughter of Jakob Engstrand, a carpenter, and the late Johanna, Mrs. Alving's former maid. In fact, she is the illegitimate daughter of Johanna and Captain Alving. She only learns this at the end of the play. Throughout the play, she resists her father's dubious affection and takes pride from working in Mrs. Alving's home. She seems to return Oswald's affection, even peppering her speech with French, which she has learned in the hope that Oswald will take her to Paris. However, she is careful not to overstep the bounds of what is proper.
