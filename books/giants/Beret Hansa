Beret Hansa is Per's suffering wife. Unlike her husband, Beret cannot endure life on the prairie, and she longs to return to the comforts of her home in Norway. However, she still loves her husband and does not blame him for persuading her to emigrate. She constantly fears the unknown, lurking threats of the wilderness. Incapable of severing ties to her old country, she gradually sinks into depression and thinks about death. When a plague of locusts arrive, Beret descends into madness, and Per fears for her and the children's safety. A traveling minister finally cures Beret, but she only replaces her former madness with a religious mania. Unlike her husband, she is a thinker and an introvert and at times displays a cold personality.
