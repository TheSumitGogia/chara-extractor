Hans Olsa is Per's best friend and Beret's childhood friend. Hans was a fisherman in Norway along with Per until Per persuaded him to move to America. The two friends become neighbors in the Dakota Territory. Hans is naturally good-natured, physically strong, and mentally slow. He prospers along with Per, but they both become victims of the harsh environment when they die from the fierce winter of 1880â€“1881.
