Peder Victorious is Per and Beret's youngest child. Peder Victorious is born on Christmas Day during their first winter in the Dakota Territory. He provides a source of amusement for the settlement during the lonely winter. When Per wants to baptize the child Peder Victorious, Beret refuses to accept the name, reasoning that the name is sacrilegious.
