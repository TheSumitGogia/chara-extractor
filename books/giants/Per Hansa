Per Hansa is a former fisherman from Norway who immigrates to the Dakota Territory with his wife, children, and other friends. A man of action and a natural pioneer, Per possesses indomitable optimism and courage in the face of hardship. He dreams about building a kingdom in the Great Plains for his wife and family. Intelligent and strong, Per becomes the natural leader of his community, seeming to succeed at almost everything he does. To protect his friends and neighbors, he removes the stakes he finds in their land that belong to earlier settlers. Although he is capable of great tenderness in his relations with his wife and children, he gradually drifts apart from his wife. Unlike his wife, Per exudes warmth, cheer, and good humor.
