Polly is a disfigured patient. Before entering McLean, Polly poured gasoline over her face and upper body and set herself aflame. Polly appears to be at peace, even cheerful, during her first year at the hospital. One day, Polly suddenly becomes aware of the awful extent of her injuries. She is inconsolable. Kaysen notes that although everyone at McLean is affected by sickness, Polly is the only patient trapped forever by the consequences of her illness.
