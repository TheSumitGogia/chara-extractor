The Giver is the old man known in the community as the Receiver of Memory. The Giver has held the communityâ€™s collective memory for many years and uses his wisdom to help the Committee of Elders make important decisions, even though he is racked by the pain his memories give him and believes that perhaps those memories belong in the minds of everyone in the community.
