Captain Edward Ashburnham is Dowell describes Edward Ashburnham as "the cleanest looking sort of chap," "an excellent magistrate, a first-rate soldier, and one of the best landlords." He appears to be exactly the sort of man one could trust with his wife. He is generous with those who live on his land and even jumps overboard from a ship to save a drowning man. But Edward is not practical; he is a poor manager of money and easily led by instincts of lust and passion. Though the narrator deeply sympathizes with Edward's "good intentions," such an assessment of him is questionable.
