Leonora Powys Ashburnham is Described as a "sheer individualist," Leonora cares deeply that her affairs are in order and that the Ashburnham family maintains every ounce of propriety. She is economical, practical, and efficient with matters of money. Though she has the capacity to be deeply in love with her husband, Edward, she is also easily hurt by him. When wounded, Leonora defends herself with great power and cruelty. Above all, she seeks to have a "normal" life, free of the distractions of her husband's passion.
