Also known as "the Girl," Nancy Rufford becomes the ward of Leonora and Edward after her mother abandons her and her father leaves for India. Having been educated in a convent school with nuns, Nancy remains very naive and unworldly. She is in awe of what she perceives to be her heroic uncle (Edward) and his wonderful marriage. She willingly "sacrifices" herself to save Edward at the end of the story, but ultimately, along with the other "passionate" people, she is destroyed by madness.
