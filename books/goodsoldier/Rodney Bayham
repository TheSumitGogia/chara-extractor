Described by Dowell as "quite an economical person of so normal a figure that he can get quite a large portion of his clothes ready-made," Rodney Bayham is portrayed as the utterly normal (and somewhat boring) British man. He is the second husband of Leonora, and is mentioned, but does not act, in the story. His character serves as a foil to Edward; Bayham is 'perfectly normal' and quite respectable in his quiet (passionless) liaisons.
