Hrothgar is King of the Danes. Hrothgar maintains a highly powerful and prosperous kingdom until Grendel begins terrorizing the area. InBeowulf,Hrothgar is an exemplary model of kingship, but inGrendelhe is more flawed and human. Grendel often describes his war with the humans as a personal battle between Hrothgar and himself.
