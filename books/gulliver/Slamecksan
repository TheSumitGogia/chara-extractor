Slamecksan is the Low-Heels, a Lilliputian political group reminiscent of the British Whigs. The king has ordained that all governmental administrators must be selected from this party, much to the resentment of the High-Heels of the realm. Thus, while there are fewer Slamecksan than Tramecksan in Lilliput, their political power is greater. The kingâ€™s own sympathies with the Slamecksan are evident in the slightly lower heels he wears at court.
