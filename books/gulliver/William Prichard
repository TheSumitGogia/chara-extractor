William Prichard is the master of theAntelope,the ship on which Gulliver embarks for the South Seas at the outset of his first journey, in 1699. When theAntelopesinks, Gulliver is washed ashore on Lilliput. No details are given about the personality of Prichard, and he is not important in Gulliver’s life or in the unfolding of the novel’s plot. That Gulliver takes pains to name him accurately reinforces our impression that he is obsessive about facts but not always reliable in assessing overall significance.
