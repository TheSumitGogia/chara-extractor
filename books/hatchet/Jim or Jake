Jim or Jake is the pilot of the Cessna plane. He is a man in his mid-forties and the only other person on the plane. He is quiet at the beginning of the trip and later on allows Brian to control the board and get the feel for flying. He dies of a heart attack, forcing Brian to attempt to control the plane's descent.
