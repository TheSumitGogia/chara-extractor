Jonah Herzog is Moses' father, he was a Russian-Jewish immigrant who moved his family to Canada and raised his four children in the slums of Montreal on Napoleon Street. He worked long hours to support the five members of his family, but often failed in his endeavors. He ended up working as a bootlegger, and had trouble succeeding at that, too. He had a temper, and made empty threats. Once, he threatened Moses with a gun. Good at heart, on his death Jonah left Moses twenty thousand dollars. Moses has fond childhood memories of helping his father label the smuggled bottles of liquor.
