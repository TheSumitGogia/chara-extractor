Ramona is Moses' lover, she is Argentinean, and the woman in Moses' life throughout the novel. She is beautiful, well-educated, and, as Moses puts it, a "priestess" of sex and love, the epitome of "sex and swagger." She cooks extravagant meals for Moses, tends to him, and even follows him to the country.
