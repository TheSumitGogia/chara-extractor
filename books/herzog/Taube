Taube is Moses' stepmother, she was Jonah Herzog's second wife. She had been widowed twice, and lived alone in the old house she used share with Jonah. When she was married to Kaplitzky, a wholesaler who loved her dearly, she excelled at the role of rich, childless darling. Taube is now an old woman, and Moses calls her a survivor who fights off death.
