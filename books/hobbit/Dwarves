Dwarves is Thorin’s group, composed of Fili, Kili, Dwalin, Balin, Oin, Gloin, Ori, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur, none of whom is really developed as an individual character in the novel. The narrator describes dwarves unfavorably in Chapter12, noting their greed and trickery. Some, however, are “decent enough people like Thorin and Company, if you don’t expect too much.”
