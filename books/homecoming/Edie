Edie is Louis's girlfriend. Edie buys into Louis's cynical and self-indulgent philosophies about life and right and wrong. Louis convinced her to steal money from her father and run away with him, and occasionally he teases her and treats her cruelly. Edie is a gentle girl and plays the autoharp, so the children warily agree to spending time with the couple.
