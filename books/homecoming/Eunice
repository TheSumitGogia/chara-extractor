Eunice is the Tillerman children's cousin. Eunice is Gram's sister's daughter. Eunice is a pious Catholic used to her routine and very nearly incapable of spontaneity and affection. She takes the Tillerman children in out of a sense of duty, but, consciously or not, expects the children to show gratitude and earn their keep through their good behavior and hard work. Fussy and flighty, Eunice lives a carefully scripted life.
