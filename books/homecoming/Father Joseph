Father Joseph is Eunice's priest. Father Joseph is a well-intentioned but ultimately unsympathetic man. Eunice relies on him for advice when the Tillerman children appear on his doorstep. Though, from his perspective, he has the good of the children firmly in mind, he never truly tries to understand them or reach out to them. Like Eunice, he is guided by a sense of piety, religious duty, and propriety.
