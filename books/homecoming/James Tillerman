James Tillerman is Dicey's twelve-year-old brother. James is serious and intelligent, and unlike Dicey, cannot fight to defend himself when his peers tease him about his family. Consequently, James withdraws into his studies and philosophical musings. He reacts to Momma's departure more harshly and judgmentally than Dicey, and occasionally indulges in criticism of her lifestyle to help explain why she left them. He looks up to Dicey and relies on her to make decisions, but can also act rebelliously and selfishly.
