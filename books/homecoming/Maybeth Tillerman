Maybeth Tillerman is Dicey's eight-year-old sister. Maybeth is a quiet and pretty young girl troubled by an overwhelming shyness. Her shyness and difficulty performing in front of others have resulted in her being held back in school and in the perception of her peers and teachers that she is mentally retarded. The Tillermans know differently. Maybeth is uncannily emotionally perceptive and can quickly and easily sense the emotional truth behind people and the implications of the situations in which they find themselves. Maybeth takes after Momma physically, and can sing beautifully.
