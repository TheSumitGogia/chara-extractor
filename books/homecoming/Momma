Momma is the Tillerman's mother. Momma decided when she left home at the age of twenty never to marry, having learned from Gram's sad example. Momma is loving and beautiful, but is neither reliable nor practical. When Momma is pregnant with Sammy, their fourth child, the childrens' father leaves her, possibly under legal duress. Momma struggles under the responsibility of raising her four children on her own, but eventually buckles under the pressure.
