Sammy Tillerman is Dicey's six-year-old brother. Sammy is a stubborn and uninhibited child. Momma's favorite, and as the youngest, he is perhaps hardest hit by Momma's disappearance. Like Dicey, Sammy has learned how to fight to ward off the taunts of his peers, which are even worse for him than for Dicey because the children tease him about Maybeth as well as about Momma. Thus, Sammy is belligerent, aggressive, and stubborn, but often, especially with his family, he is joyful, spontaneous, and utterly free. This recklessly happy side of Sammy is part of what wins Gram over in the end of the book.
