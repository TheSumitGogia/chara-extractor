Stewart is Windy's roommate. Stewart is quieter and more serious than Windy, but just as generous and open-hearted. He talks gravely to James about the personal implications of stealing, and plays the Dobro, teaching the children a song they take with them all the way to Crisfield. Stewart drives the children to Bridgeport in his car.
