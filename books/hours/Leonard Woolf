Leonard Woolf is Virginia Woolf’s husband. Leonard is the editor and publisher of the Hogarth Press, and he believes Virginia to be the most important writer of her generation. Though occasionally testy and curmudgeonly, he never becomes angry with Virginia, though he worries about her constantly. He looks out for Virginia’s health when she becomes too distracted to do so herself.
