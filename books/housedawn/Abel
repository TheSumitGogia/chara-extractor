Abel is the novel's protagonist, a young Native American man. Abel has grown up in Walatowa, New Mexico, under the care of his grandfather, Francisco. Abel has just returned from war, and one of the first things we learn about him is that he is often drunk. He is reserved, not talking unless necessary, and is by nature slow to open up to others. Like many around him at Walatowa, he feels a strong connection to the earth and the landscape around him, and his spiritual upbringing, such as his membership in the Eagle Watchers Society, is firmly grounded in a relationship with the outdoors.
