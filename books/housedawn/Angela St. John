Angela St. John is a pale, brunette white woman who has recently married and who arrives at the Benevides house at Walatowa for rest and relaxation. Angela, by Abel's standards, is impatient. From her perspective, however, Abel is too silent, and causes her significant irritation. When Abel goes to work at Angela's house to chop firewood, her fascination that she has never seen a man put his whole body into work like Abel does eventually leads to their love affair.
