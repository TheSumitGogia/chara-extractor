Francisco is Abel's grandfather, who affectionately calls Abel "Abelito." The elderly Francisco, a farmer, remembers how different life for the area's Indians in 1945 is from how life used to be years ago. As one of the elders, he participates in gatherings of elders in the kiva—a partly-underground ceremonial structure—during important events such as feasts. Francisco has raised Abel and his brother, Vidal, the way his ancestors raised him, telling them the stories of his tribe and the stories of the land around Walatowa. At some point after his youth one of his legs stiffened up because of disease.
