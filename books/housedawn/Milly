Milly is the only daughter of a farmer in Oklahoma who has come to Los Angeles for an education. Milly, who has blond hair, a plain face, and a constant laugh, is now a social worker on Abel's case. Sensitive enough to notice that Abel hates the questions on her social-services surveys, she starts visiting Ben and Abel merely on a social level, which causes Abel to begin to appreciate her. Milly and Abel eventually become lovers, and she nurtures him even when he loses his job and starts drinking heavily.
