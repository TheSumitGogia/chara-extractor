The proud Dona Ester Trueba is a direct descendant of one of Peru's oldest families. In her youth she fell in love with and married the lower class immigrant Trueba. The money she brought to the marriage quickly ran out, her husband died, and she is afflicted by severe arthritis which confines her to a wheelchair. She dies shortly after Esteban has finished restoring Tres Marias.
