Never given any other name in the story, The Candidate runs for president for the Socialist Party every single year, never expecting to win. Over these years he and Jaime become friends. He is as surprised as the Conservatives are when he wins the election. He does his best as president, but he has great difficulties running the country in the face of the Conservative's attempts to undermine his government. He is one of the first people killed during the Military Coup.
