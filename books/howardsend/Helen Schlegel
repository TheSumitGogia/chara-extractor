Helen Schlegel is Margaret's sister, a passionate, flighty girl of  21 who lives for art, literature, and "human  relations."  Like Margaret, Helen is a representative  of the idealistic, cultured Schlegel family, which  represents the intellectual aspect of the upper  classes.  But Helen, who is prettier than Margaret,  is also much less grounded and far more prone to  excessive and dramatic behavior.
