Leonard Bast is a poor insurance clerk on the very bottom rung of the  middle class--he has money for food, clothing, and a  place to live, but not much else, and is constantly  beset with financial worries.  Married to Jacky.   Leonard represents the aspirations of the lower  classes; he is obsessed with self-improvement and  reads constantly, hoping to lift himself up.  But he  is never able to transform his meager education into  an improved standard of living.  Late in the novel,  Leonard has a sexual encounter with Helen  Schlegel, which results in his becoming the father  of Helen's child.  Leonard is killed by Charles  Wilcox near the end of the novel.
