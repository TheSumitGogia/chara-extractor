Ruth Wilcox is Henry's wife, who dies in the first half of the  novel.  Gentle, selfless, loving, and strangely  omniscient, Mrs. Wilcox seems to represent the past  of England.  Howards End belongs to her, and she  attempts to leave it to Margaret when she dies,  an attempt which is blocked by Henry and Charles.
