Aunt Linda is a slave on the Johnson plantation. Aunt Linda’s clairvoyant visions reveal her strong faith, as she predicts the slaves’ freedom and ultimate salvation. She also acts as a preacher of sorts who converses regularly with other characters about leading a moral life, and she endorses pro-suffrage and antislavery sentiment. Intelligent and worldly, the feminist Aunt Linda establishes her own business and contributes her earnings toward purchasing a home for herself and her husband.
