Eugene Leroy is Iolaâ€™s white father and a wealthy Southern plantation and slave owner. Leroy leads a morally depraved and spiritually empty lifestyle fraught with carousing and carelessness until he falls ill. Progressive in thought and bold in his actions, Leroy marries a slave, Marie, at a time when southern culture deemed him a social pariah for doing so. However, the cautious father overprotects his children and hides their true identities from them.
