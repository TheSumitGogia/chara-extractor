Harry Leroy is Iola’s brother, Miss Delany’s fiancé, and a soldier in the Union army’s black regimen. Harry initially wavers about his decision to pass as black, unwilling to accept the decline in social status that accompanies such a choice. At times portrayed as lacking confidence and appearing physically weak, Harry’s resolve strengthens throughout the novel, and he becomes more assertive and proud of identifying himself as black.
