Candelaria is Another maid in the landowner’s house, where Rigoberta works in Guatemala City. Candelaria is a “ladinized” Indian, which means she speaks Spanish and wears ladino clothing, not the traditional Indian dress. Confident and street-smart, Candelaria shows Rigoberta how to perform household duties at the landowner’s house, but she also teaches her how to sabotage wealthy landowners and what it takes to stand up to authority. She is a survivor who holds onto her dignity, even though she is eventually thrown out of the landowner’s house.
