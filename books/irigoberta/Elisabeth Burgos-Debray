Elisabeth Burgos-Debray is the editor ofI, Rigoberta Menchu. Burgos-Debray interviewed, recorded, transcribed, and arranged Rigoberta’s autobiography. Though Burgos-Debray’s presence is only implied in the action ofI, Rigoberta Menchu, she shapes the story. An educated, left-leaning anthropologist, Burgos-Debray sympathizes with Rigoberta and holds a romantic view of her and her fellow Indian peasants. Cooking the traditional dishes that are staples in both women’s homelands, for instance, Burgos-Debray feels a deep connection with Rigoberta, but Rigoberta doesn’t return the connection because she mistrusts ladinosand other outsiders.
