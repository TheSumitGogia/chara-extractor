Dorcas's best friend from school, Felice lives with her grandmother while her mother and father work elsewhere. She is darker-skinned and less attractive than her friend Dorcas but she has a much stronger sense of self and she disapproves of the other girl's reckless behavior even though she often acts as an accomplice or provides Dorcas with an alibi.
