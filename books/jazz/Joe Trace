Violet's husband, Joe Trace is a good looking man in his late fifties who, despite having lived in the City for twenty years, retains the boyish innocence and dignified comportment of a hardworking outdoorsman. Joe works hard, shuttling between a job as a waiter and a cosmetic salesman. The women in Harlem trust and respect Joe because he seems decent and honest. Joe loves his wife but is hurt when she closes herself off from him because of her depression. A sympathetic character, Joe is nonetheless a murderer and adulterer, cheating on his wife and then killing his lover.
