Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain is Union. Thirty-four years old, Chamberlain has left his home in Maine and a comfortable professorship at Bowdoin College to come to war. He is the colonel of the Twentieth Maine Infantry regiment. He was an excellent student at school, speaks seven languages, and has a lovely singing voice, but all his life he has wanted to be a soldier. He lied to Bowdoin and told them he was going on sabbatical to France because they would not let him go to war. He is an intellectual, given to brooding and poetic thoughts.
