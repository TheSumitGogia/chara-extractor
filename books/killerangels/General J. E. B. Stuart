General J. E. B. Stuart is Confederacy. Stuart is the cavalry leader assigned by Lee to track the movements of the Union army. A fun-loving publicity hound, Stuart is off joyriding for the first two days of the battle, and it is his negligence that causes the Confederate army to lose track of the Union troops in the first place. Because of Stuartâ€™s absence, during the first two days the Confederates never know where the Union troops are or what the surrounding area looks like.
