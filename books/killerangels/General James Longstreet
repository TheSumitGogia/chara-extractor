General James Longstreet is Confederacy. Lee’s second in command and, since the death of “Stonewall” Jackson, his most important general. At forty-two, Longstreet is full-bearded, slow talking, and crude. He is aware of the new nature of warfare, and he knows that military tactics have to change with new technology. He is very stubborn, but he has great respect for Robert E. Lee, and ultimately he defers to his commander’s judgment, though not without a good deal of argument. All three of his children were killed by a fever during the winter before the Battle of Gettysburg. This loss has sunk the usually jovial Longstreet into a depression that is severe at times.
