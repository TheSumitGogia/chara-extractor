General Jubal Early is Confederacy. A young, ambitious, and cold general. Like Ewell, he has been given a part of Jacksonâ€™s old command. He accepts this responsibility easily. He is capable and confident, but also pushy, particularly with Ewell. Though Ewell technically has the greater responsibility and the greater control, he defers to Early. Longstreet and Armistead despise Early.
