Margaret Weylin is Tom Weylinâ€™s wife. Margaret spoils her son and goes half-crazy after her infant twins die. Dim-witted and temperamental, Margaret lashes out at the slaves. Once she begins using opium, she transforms from a peevish and overwrought woman into a mellow person who is sickeningly sweet to those she formerly abused.
