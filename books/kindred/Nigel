Nigel is the son of two slaves, Luke and Carrie, and the grandson of Sarah. Because Nigel’s father advises him to follow his own path, Nigel dreams of running away and views freedom as a possibility. Although he is whipped for infractions, Nigel’s usefulness makes him largely untouchable. As boys, Nigel and Rufus are friends. As an adult, however, Nigel realizes that Rufus does not view him as a true friend.
