Tess is the slave forced to sleep with Weylin and Edwards. When her value as a sexual slave is diminished, Tess is sold off. She is a kind and helpful person. She fears what eventually comes to pass: that she will be forced to work in the fields so that Edwards can keep a closer eye on her. Tessâ€™s fate shows that slave owners afford no special treatment or consideration even to their lovers.
