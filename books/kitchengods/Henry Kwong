Henry Kwong is Helen's second husband. Henry loves his wife very much, and it is important for him to look good and strong in front of her. He is not as he seems, however, and is, in some ways weak, as is illustrated by the fact that he takes credit for Auntie Du's work in getting Winnie out of prison. Nevertheless, he is a good man.
