Jiang Sao-yan is Winnie's father. Jiang Sao-yan is a wealthy and powerful man at the beginning of the story who forces his daughter to live with his brother and his wives so as not to be reminded of Winnie's mother. He begins powerful but ends up a weak man with no memory and a lack of will. It is dubious whether he has the capacity to love, but one action—the act of giving his daughter the gold ingots—redeems him somewhat.
