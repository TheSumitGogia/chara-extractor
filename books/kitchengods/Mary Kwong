Mary Kwong is Helen's daughter. Mary is married to a physician and is also the daughter of immigrants. She is married to a doctor who had treated Pearl and, therefore knows about Winnie's condition. She is careful around Pearl, somewhat too careful. This overly "sympathetic" behavior deeply irritates Pearl. She is also a person that is very concerned with appearances.
