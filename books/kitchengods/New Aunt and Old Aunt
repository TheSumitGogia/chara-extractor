New Aunt and Old Aunt is Winnie's Aunts. New Aunt and Old Aunt raised Winnie in Winnie's father's house. Old Aunt is the more conservative of the two, basing her beliefs on ancient Chinese customs. New Aunt is younger, yet still conservative. Both treat Winnie as an outsider of sorts, and yet later, when the war is over, they seem to have real love for her.
