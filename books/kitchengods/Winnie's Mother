Winnie's mother. She disappears from the novel early on, and yet she plays a central role since she mysteriously disappeared from Winnie's life and changed it forever. She had been a modern Shanghai woman who had wanted to marry for love and was, instead, forced to take on the position of second wife to a man for whom she did not care. Because she was strong-willed and independent-minded, she escaped her marriage and her station in life, one way or another.
