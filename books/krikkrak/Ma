Ma is Grace and Caroline’s mother. Ma maintains her Haitian traditions and beliefs twenty-five years after leaving. Ma is sad to see Caroline with a non-Haitian because the marriage represents the end of Haitian culture in their family. She’s ashamed that her husband stopped loving her and that she has nothing but her daughters, who will leave her.
