Mrs. Bolton is Ivy Bolton is Clifford's nurse and caretaker. She is a competent, complex, still-attractive middle-aged woman. Years before the action in this novel, her husband died in an accident in the mines owned by Clifford's family. Even as Mrs. Bolton resents Clifford as the owner of the mines--and, in a sense, the murderer of her husband--she still maintains a worshipful attitude towards him as the representative of the upper class. Her relationship with Clifford--she simultaneously adores and despises him, while he depends and looks down on her--is probably the most fascinating and complex relationship in the novel.
