Caroline Perry is Paul's first and only love and Mitchell's wife. Paul first meets the kindhearted Caroline when she is defending and comforting a black boy from the taunting of peers. Caroline is industrious, independent, forthright, and strong willedâ€”she never hesitates to speak her mind or cling stubbornly to her convictions. Mitchell and Paul welcome her onto the forty acres as a hard worker and as a source of laughter, happiness, and comfort. She serves as an unlimited supply of inspiration and faith.
