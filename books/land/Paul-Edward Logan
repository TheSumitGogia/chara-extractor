Paul-Edward Logan is the protagonist and narrator of the novel. Paul is a steady, hardworking young man of mixed racial heritage. Throughout his life, he struggles to come to terms with his relationship to his white, landowning and formerly slave-owning, family and with his deep desire to own land. He seeks to master his fate and limit the extent to which the racist, postbellum (post-Civil War) southern society can circumscribe his role. Paul is a skilled horseman and furniture maker and an industrious laborer. He is loyal and fair, and he reacts calmly in the face of cruelty and racism, while persistently trying to counteract bigotry and injustice.
