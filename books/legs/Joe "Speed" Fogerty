Joe "Speed" Fogerty is Jack's driver and right-hand man, he is the spitting image of Eddie. Fogerty carries around Eddie's revolver and essentially provides a replacement for Jack's brother. Fogerty does not like to fight, so Jack rarely asks him to strong-arm anyone, and Fogerty usually leaves Eddie's .38 millimeter gun unloaded.
