Marion "Kiki" Roberts is Jack's girlfriend, she is a stereotypical Broadway dancer. She has a perfect body and knows how to wield her sex appeal, but is not exceptionally intelligent and she can't cook, either. She loves to party and hates being left alone when Jack has to do business or go home to his wife.
