Agustín de Carvajal (“The Bishop”) is the Augustine friar who served as bishop of Guamanga from 1612 until his death in 1620. The bishop risks his life to help Catalina escape the constables in Guamanga, and he is one of the only people to get through Catalina’s tough exterior. She is deeply touched by his spirituality and refers to him as a “saintly man.” He is the first person to whom she confesses the truth of her biological gender. Bearing out her faith in his caring and belief in honor, he protects Catalina after she makes her confession.
