Captain Esteban Eguiño is Catalina’s uncle, also the first cousin of Catalina’s mother. Esteban hires her on as ship’s boy on his vessel, and although he does not recognize her as his niece, as a loyal Basque he allows Catalina to curry favor with him simply due to the fact that her background is also Basque.
