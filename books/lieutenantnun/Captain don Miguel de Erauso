Captain don Miguel de Erauso is Catalina’s father, a native-born resident of San Sebastian, Spain. Captain de Erauso is genuinely anguished by Catalina’s flight from the convent and resolutely searches for her, even going to the king’s secretary for assistance. He does not recognize Catalina when he sees her dressed as a page, but expresses great concern for her.
