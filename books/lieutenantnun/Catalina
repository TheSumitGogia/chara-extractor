Catalina is the narrator of the memoir that covers twenty-six years of her life. Catalina escapes a convent at the age of fifteen and lives her life as a man, joining the army and inciting violence both on and off the battlefield. Although Catalina does not exhibit significant emotional growth during this time, she is weighed down by the secret that she keeps—that of her biological gender—and much of the focus of her memoir is the price she pays to keep this secret. Catalina also explores her conflicting feelings about the church and God, as well as her intense patriotism toward her native country, Spain.Read anin-depth analysis of Catalina.
