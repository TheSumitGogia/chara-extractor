Bejance is an old black slave who works as a basket maker. Like True Son, he grew up with an Indian tribe, the Wyandottes of Virginia, and misses the freedom of his youth very much. The experiences he has endured in both the Indian and white worlds have given the slave a wise perspective on life, which he is able to share with True Son and Gordie.
