Del Hardy is the twenty-year-old soldier Del provides a contrasting viewpoint to True Son's perspective on frontier life. Del was raised near Indians and knows their customs and language. His background causes him to be more sympathetic toward True Son than some of the other white characters, but he is still a strong white soldier who adamantly believes in the superiority of whites. He does not understand why True Son cannot appreciate the white way of life.
