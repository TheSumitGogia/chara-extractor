Gordie is True Son's na√Øve younger brother. Gordie seems unaware that True Son's actions or behavior is different from whites'. On the contrary, Gordie looks up to his older brother and tries to defend him against their less tolerant relatives. A truly loving and understanding character, Gordie symbolizes hope for the whites, and he represents the innocent children who are destroyed by the ongoing racial war. His relationship with True Son is the most powerful bond True Son establishes with another white.
