Myra Butler is True Son's white mother. Myra Butler has been an invalid ever since he was stolen from their family. Like Harry Butler, Myra loves True Son very much and has experienced guilt since his disappearance. She wants desperately to believe that True Son will one day give up his Indian ways and refuses to listen to the pessimistic Aunt Kate. However, True Son views his white mother as disgraceful, since she does not work, as he believes women should.
