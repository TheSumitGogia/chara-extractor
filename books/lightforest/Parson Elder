A thin, wise, and elderly man, Parson Elder is one of the most respected and accomplished citizens of Paxton Township. He has worked as a colonel and farmer, in addition to being the village pastor. Although he firmly believes in Christian superiority, Pastor Elder understands the complex situation that exists between whites and Indians. He is able to see True Son's perspective on the violent nature of whites, and he is honest about the mistakes he has committed as a military leader.
