Thitpan, whose appropriate name means "Bitter," is Little Crane's brother. A bloodthirsty and ruthless man, Thitpan's character strongly parallels that of Uncle Wilse. Just as Uncle Wilse has no mercy for Indians, Thitpan has no compassion for whites and feels justified in killing even white children.
