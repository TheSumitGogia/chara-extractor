Uncle Wilse is a radical white supremacist and leader of the infamous Paxton boys. Wilse is True Son's large-set and powerful uncle, who believes strongly in the extermination of the Indian race. His aggressive intolerance represents the racist attitudes of many white settlers of the eighteenth century. Like his nephew True Son, Wilse is stubborn, passionate about his feelings, and willing to use violence against those he perceives as enemies.
