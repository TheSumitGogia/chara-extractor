Mr. Hines (a.k.a. Uncle Doc) is Joe Christmasâ€™s biological grandfather. Uncle Doc is an unkempt, angry, and spiteful man whose violence and extreme behavior have landed him in jail more than once. Infamous for his crazed ravings, he uses his religious fundamentalism to justify his implicit belief in white superiority. His extreme, unyielding sense of right and propriety pollutes his better intentions, causing him to punish and betray those who are closest to him. He shuffles around in a near-catatonic state that is interrupted only by his boisterous attempts to incite the residents of first Mottstown and then Jefferson to lynch his grandson.
