Mrs. Hines is Joe Christmas’s biological grandmother. Short, obese, and round-faced, Mrs. Hines is a shadow figure whom few in town recognize, even though she has lived there for years. She is eccentric and emotional, and her tenuous grasp on reality is compromised when the grandson she thought was dead is charged with the murder of Miss Burden. Mrs. Hines’s passivity and deference to her husband have led to a series of tragedies—mistakes she desires to make up for only when it is too late.
