Mrs. McEachern is Joe Christmas’s foster mother. Mrs. McEachern is a timid, hunched woman with a weather-beaten face that makes her look considerably older than her husband. A silent, cringing, somewhat invisible presence in the family, she tries to earn her son’s love and respect by countering her husband’s violence with excessive doting and kindness. She also attempts to forge a closer bond with her adopted son by creating and indulging in secrets that only the two of them share.
