Simon McEachern is Joe Christmasâ€™s foster father. Mr. McEachern is a thick-bodied man with a closely cropped brown beard and cold, light-colored eyes. Stern and devout, his religiosity borders on fanaticism and far outweighs the limited reserves of kindness and sympathy that he is able to muster. Blinded by his extreme faith and belief in divine retribution, he displays a marked contempt for humanity and the folly and sin of others. He upholds that hard labor, self-sacrifice, self-denial, and personal suffering are the hallmarks of a life lived in an upstanding and staunchly moral manner. However, he is prone to violence, and his unyielding and authoritarian presence compromises his essential humanity and ultimately provokes the homicidal rage of his foster son.
