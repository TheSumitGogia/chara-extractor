Jake Blount is a heavy-drinking, ranting man who comes into town and frequents Mr. Brannon's caf√©. Jake is a bizarre looking man: short, but with long arms, large hands, and a moustache that appears oddly detached from his somewhat distorted face. He drinks constantly and often goes on long, frustrated rants about socialism. Jake's behavior is extremely volatile and occasionally violent.
