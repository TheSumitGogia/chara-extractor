Pierce Inverarity is Oedipa's ex-boyfriend and a fabulously rich real-estate tycoon. We never meet him except in Oedipa's memories, which tell us that he liked to play with his own voice by doing vocal impersonations. He was a general jokester in real life and may be playing a mean trick on Oedipa by inventing this whole Tristero conspiracy.
