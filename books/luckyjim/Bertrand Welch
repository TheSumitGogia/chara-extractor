Bertrand Welch is the eldest of Professor Welch's two sons. Bertrand lives in London, where he has begun a career as a painter. Bertrand presents himself as cultured, witty, and cosmopolitan, which usually translates into a kind of elitism. Bertrand looks up to the rich and very definitely considers Dixon to be below him. Bertrand hopes to get a job with Christine's uncle, Gore- Urquhart, as the wealthy patron's personal assistant. Bertrand plans to marry Christine in a couple of years, even though he is currently having an affair with Carol Goldsmith.
