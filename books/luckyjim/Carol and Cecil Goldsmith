Carol and Cecil Goldsmith is Cecil Goldsmith is Dixon's officemate and a senior lecturer in the History Department at the college. Carol Goldsmith is in her forties and is having an affair with Bertrand Welch, which she has told her husband about. Dixon considers Carol to be an ally of his, as she is good at turning people's statements back on them and speaks frankly. Dixon is also impressed by her "femaleness," which seems mostly to consist of her ability to admit she enjoys sex. The Goldsmiths are friends with Dixon and Margaret, as well as with the Welches.
