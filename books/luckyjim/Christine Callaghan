Christine Callaghan lives in London, and dates Bertrand for most of the novel. Christine's family seems to have money—her uncle is the rich Gore-Urquhart—but Christine herself works in a bookshop and wears the same outfit every time Dixon sees her. Christine can come off as prissy and prim, but truly enjoys Dixon's predicaments and laughs unabashedly. Christine is very good-looking and presents herself well, leading Dixon to believe at first that she would never date a man such as himself.
