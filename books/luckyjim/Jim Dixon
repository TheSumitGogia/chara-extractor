The narrative ofLucky Jimcenters on the thoughts and feelings of Jim Dixon, an unremarkable young man about to complete his first year as an assistant lecturer in the Department of History at a provincial college in Britain. Intolerant of the pretension and hypocrisy of the college's faculty and their families, Jim hides his contempt, channeling it into venomous mental outbursts and a wide array of nasty faces. Dixon can be clumsy and careless, and even sneaky and mean to those he truly hates, but is genuine and compassionate as well.
