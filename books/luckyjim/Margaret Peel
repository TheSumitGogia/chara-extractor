Margaret Peel holds a slightly higher post than Jim Dixon at the same college. Margaret and Dixon are close, and Margaret imagines that she knows Dixon better than anyone else. Margaret is not very attractive and tries to compensate for this by wearing arty clothing and too much make-up. Margaret has her moments of straightforward discussion with Dixon, but can just as quickly become clingy, condescending, or aggressive. She takes advantage of Dixon's good-natured concern for her to keep him in a relationship, and even fakes a suicide attempt to attract the concern of either Dixon or Catchpole.
