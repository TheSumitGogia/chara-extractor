Professor Ned Welch is Professor Welch seems to have been holding his job for quite some time. He is an absent-minded man who rambles on about old English music, the recorder, and children's artwork, not noticing whether or not his audience cares. Welch is certainly not malicious, but he is an extremely bad driver due his general lack of awareness to things around him. He and his wife have some social pretensions, and they often try to attract the local press to musical events at their house. Professor Welch believes that things were better in the old days, and wishes he could go back to his sentimentalized ideal of the period in English history when everyone made their own music and artwork.
