Lucy Josephine Potter is Anau pairfor a wealthy American family, and the novelâ€™s protagonist and narrator. More than anything, Lucy wants to escape the influence of her native land, a British-ruled Caribbean island, but her homesickness and difficult relationship with her mother stand in her way. Sharply observant and frequently critical, she grows close to her employers while remaining keenly aware of the disparate circumstances separating her from them. Lucy unapologetically enjoys her sexual encounters with men but reserves her deepest, most painful feelings for her relationships with women. Though she suffers persistent dissatisfaction and disillusion as her new existence fails to meet her expectations, she also experiences moments of hope and peace and demonstrates great strength and determination in her quest to live on her own terms.
