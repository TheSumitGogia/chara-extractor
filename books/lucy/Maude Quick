Maude Quick is the woman from Lucy’s homeland who brings Lucy news of her father’s death. Though Maude strikes Lucy’s mother as a model of proper behavior, Maude serves as a bit of a foil for Lucy, who finds her sadistic and an inspiration, by negative example, to leave her mother’s home by age nineteen. Despite Maude’s unpleasantness, she provides Lucy some comfort when bringing news of Lucy’s father’s death, evoking Lucy’s violently mixed feelings about her native land.
