Carol is the novel's main protagonist, from whose point of view nearly the entire story is told. Intelligent and vivacious, Carol Milford attends college in Minneapolis and then works as a librarian in St. Paul for three years before marrying Dr. Will Kennicott and moving to Gopher Prairie. An incurable romantic, she yearns to bring beauty and culture to the ugly towns of the Middle West. Her failed attempts to reform Gopher Prairie provide the novel's main conflict. Unhappy with her life in Gopher Prairie, Carol seeks escape through books and a romantic friendship with a young man named Erik. In the end, however, the town defeats her. She leaves Gopher Prairie to move to Washington, D.C., but returns and accepts the town as it is. Throughout the novel, her marriage to Kennicott endures its ups and downs, although she continues to love and admire him. Lewis loosely based Gopher Prairie on his own hometown of Sauk Centre, Minnesota, and the character of Carol on himself.Read anin-depth analysis of Carol.
