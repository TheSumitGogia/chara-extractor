Guy Pollock is Another important friend of Carol's. Guy is an intelligent, middle-aged bachelor lawyer. Although Carol admires him briefly, she discovers, to her disappointment, that he maintains a defeatist attitude and feels quite content doing nothing important with his life. During an important conversation with Carol, Guy explains that he suffers from the "Village Virus," a disease that saps the will of ambitious people who live in small towns.
