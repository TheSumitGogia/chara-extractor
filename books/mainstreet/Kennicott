Kennicott is the novel's secondary protagonist. Dr. Will Kennicott provides a foil to his wife, Carol. While she also desires achieving social change and individual happiness, he feels satisfied with his life and prefers to maintain the status quo. While Carol is romantic and interested in the fine arts, Kennicott is realistic and materialistic, interested only in making money and taking care of his family and patients. Will sets Carol on a pedestal and admires her, regardless of her whims. As they drift apart, however, he begins a short-lived secretive affair with Maud Dyer. When Carol moves to Washington, Kennicott visits her and courts her a second time in order to persuade her to return to Gopher Prairie.
