Miles Bjornstam is Gopher Prairie's town handyman. Miles, who supports socialism and the Democratic Party, is largely scorned by the citizens of Gopher Prairie, who consider him slightly insane. Carol, however, finds him to be a kindred spirit because she shares many of his liberal views. Although Bjornstam settles down after his marriage to Bea, he leaves Gopher Prairie forever when his wife and son, Olaf, die.
