Vida Sherwin is Gopher Prairie's high school teacher. Vida becomes one of Carol's best friends, often serving as a buffer between Carol and Gopher Prairie, as she understands both points of views. Because she once loved Will Kennicott herself, Vida develops a love-hate relationship with Carol and tries to become her adviser. While the two women share many interests, they gradually drift apart when Vida marries Raymond Wutherspoon and devotes herself to housework.
