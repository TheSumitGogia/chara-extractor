Julian of Norwich (“Dame Julian”) is One of the greatest English mystics and best-known female writers of the Middle Ages. Julian was an anchoress (female hermit) in a convent in the city of Norwich. The author of a book of her “revelations,” Julian was often sought out for guidance by political and religious authorities, as well as by common folk. Margery goes to pay her respects to Julian soon after her own mystical visions commence. The pair have a long conversation in which Julian tries to instruct Margery how to tell a true vision from a false one. Julian also tells Margery that her tears are a blessing and a sign of God’s favor.
