Margery’s Confessor (“Master R,” “Master Robert Spryngolde”) is a priest of Lynn, and Margery’s primary spiritual advisor. In Margery’s visions, Jesus instructs her several times to honor and obey the wisdom of Master Robert. Master Robert believes in Margery’s visions and defends her several times against those who would claim that her tears are fake or inspired by the devil rather than by God. Master Robert predicts that Margery will be helped on her pilgrimage by a “broken-backed man,” and the appearance of Richard in Venice seems to fulfill his prophecy. Margery’s confessor helps her through many crises, including Margery’s difficulty with her enemy (the preaching friar) and the great fire that endangers the church in Lynn. The greatest crisis in their relationship comes when Margery departs for Germany with her daughter-in-law, after Master Robert has advised her to stay home. On her return, Margery apologizes humbly and is forgiven. Margery’s sense of profound gratitude toward her confessor is best expressed by her prayer to Jesus that Master Robert have half of any blessing that Margery may receive in heaven.
