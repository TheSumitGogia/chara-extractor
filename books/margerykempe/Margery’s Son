Margery’s Son is the only one of Margery’s children to emerge as a full-fledged character. Margery’s son is described as “a tall young man” who works as a merchant in Germany. He is at first rather loose-living, and his mother warns him often of the dangers of lust and “lechery.” Margery’s worry causes friction between them, but when the son becomes covered in sores and pustules, apparently due to a venereal complaint, he decides to mend his ways. Margery’s son eventually reforms, makes a trip to Rome, and settles down with a German woman. After the birth of their first child, the couple comes to England to visit Margery, but the son becomes sick and dies soon after.
