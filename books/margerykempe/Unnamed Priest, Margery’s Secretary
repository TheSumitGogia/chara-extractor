Unnamed Priest, Margery’s Secretary is the priest who records Margery’s words, providing the text of theBook.This priest befriends Margery late in her life and agrees to help her tell her story. This is actually the second attempt to write down Margery’s life story. The first came several years before, when Margery made the attempt with an unnamed helper (very likely her son), and the result was a nearly illegible manuscript. The priest breaks into Margery’s story on occasion to verify her account or to back up her claims—for example, when Margery helps heal the young woman stricken, as Margery had been, with post-partum psychosis. The priest has a brief episode of trouble with his vision at the start of writing theBook, but he and Margery pray and his vision clears.
