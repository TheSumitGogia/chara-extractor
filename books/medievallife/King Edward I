King Edward I is Ruler of England from 1272 to 1307. An unusually strong monarch, Edward I ruled during a crucial epoch in the development of English law, witnessing the institution of parliamentary custom, common law, and codified property laws. In his last thirteen years, however, the state of England worsened as Edward I harshly taxed and drafted his subjects for his campaigns against the French and his attempted subjugation of Scotland, whose resistance was led by William Wallace.
