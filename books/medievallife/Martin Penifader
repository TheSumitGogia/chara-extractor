Martin Penifader is Cecilia’s nephew and the son of Henry Penifader. After Cecilia’s death, Martin claimed inheritance for Cecilia’s lands but was denied in favor of Cecilia’s sister Christina. Promptly following this decision, Martin received half of the lands in dispute from Christina, which suggested that he and Christina reached an informal agreement.
