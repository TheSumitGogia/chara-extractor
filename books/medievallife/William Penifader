William Penifader is Ceciliaâ€™s older brother and a wealthy and important landholder. Like Cecilia, William never married, though he did father an illegitimate son to whom he willed his lands upon his death. As an adult, William lived next door to Cecilia, sharing a wall of his house with her. Also, he was unique among peasants insofar as he was educated and served officially as a cleric in Brigstock.
