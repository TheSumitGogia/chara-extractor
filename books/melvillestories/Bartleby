Bartleby is a young man hired by the Lawyer to serve as a scrivener, or law- copyist. He starts out as an excellent copyist, but when asked to examine his work for errors, he replies that he "would prefer not to." Bartleby soon answers anything he is asked to do with "I would prefer not to," and he slowly drives the Lawyer and his fellow scriveners crazy.
