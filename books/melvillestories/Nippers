Nippers is another scrivener, or law-copyist, employed by the Lawyer in "Bartleby the Scrivener." Nipper is the opposite of his fellow scrivener Turkey; Nipper is young, and he works best in the afternoon. In the morning, he is troubled by stomach problems and a constant need to adjust the height of his desk.
