Oberlus's story is told in "Sketch Nine" of "The Encantadas." He deserted his ship and became a hermit on Hood's Isle, where he kept a small hut and grew vegetables that he sold to passing ships. He eventually began to desire lordship over other people and kidnapped several sailors. Finally he stole a small boat from a passing ship and used it to return to the mainland, where he was arrested and thrown in jail.
