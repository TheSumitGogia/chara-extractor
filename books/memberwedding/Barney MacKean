Barney MacKean is In the summer previous to the novella's action, Frankie and Barney "committed a queer sin" in Barney's garage. We can safely assume they were kissing, though McCullers is vague. Frankie's reaction to the experience with Barney tells us how she is both ignorant and afraid of matters regarding sex.
