Frankie Addams is the novella's protagonist. Frankie Addams is a precocious and gregarious twelve year-old girl in the throes of adolescence. She is in a state of limbo between the innocent, sheltered days of her childhood, and the more worldliness of young adulthood. As a result of this rift, she is disconnected from everyone around her and spends the novella searching for a way to meld with other people. She has lofty fantasies about how she will escape what she feels is a stifling existence. And she is stubborn and contentious with anyone who might stand in her way. However, her naïveté and lack of awareness of the adult world, particularly when it comes to matters of sex and interpersonal relationships, hold her back from achieving her fantastical plans. In each of the three parts of the novella, she goes by three different names: first Frankie, then F. Jasmine, and then Frances.
