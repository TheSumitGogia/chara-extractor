Honey Brown is Berenice's foster brother. Honey seems to have a few screws loose. He is unable to go to war, so he lives with Big Mama. He is a lighted skinned African- American and represents someone who might be able to change their racial identity in the same way that Frankie might otherwise change herself from an androgynous child to a feminine adult.
