Royal Quincy Addams is Frankie's quiet and serious widower. Mr. Addams' wife, Frankie's mother, died when Frankie was born. His function in the novel is minimal, as he spends most of the novel out of frame, working in his jewelry shop. When we do hear from him, it is as a stern adult voice, one that keeps the cantankerous Frankie in line.
