Louvinie is a West-African slave girl on the Saxon plantation. Louvinie has a jutting chin and is commonly thought to be so unattractive that she is relegated to working in the kitchen garden. Louvinie always wears black headrags, and many people believe she is incapable of smiling. Children are drawn to her and her ability to tell frightening tales of the supernatural.
