Meridian Hill is a young civil rights worker and the protagonist of the novel. Thin and slight, with deep brown skin, Meridian is a deeply sad and serious presence. Bold, defiant, and courageous, Meridian seems older than she is. Cynical and often pessimistic, she does not fill her life and perceptions with hope. Rather, a stubborn ambivalence often prevails.

As her illness progresses and her hair falls out, she takes to wearing a knitted cap at all times.Read anin-depth analysis of Meridian Hill.
