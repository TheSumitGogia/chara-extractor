Meridian’s Father is a former history teacher and farmer. Dreamy, quiet, and unambitious, Meridian’s father prefers mostly his own company. He has an abiding interest in historical studies, and he feels a profound connection to the Native Americans who lived on and worked the land before him. Although he is a practicing Baptist, he acknowledges the credence and viability of Native American spirituality as an alternative to the deep Christian faith his wife subscribes to.
