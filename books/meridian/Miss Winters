Miss Winters is a music professor at Saxon College. Sallow, with bulging black eyes and a blue wig, Miss Winters is worldly and learned and one of only three black instructors at the college. She teaches whatever she pleases and always manages to skirt the disapproval or control of the administration. A kindly maternal presence, she offers Meridian the warmth and forgiveness that Meridianâ€™s own mother cannot give her.
