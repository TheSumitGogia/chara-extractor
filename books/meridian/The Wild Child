The Wild Child is a pregnant orphan who lives in the slums surrounding Saxon College. Believed to be about thirteen, the Wild Child is a tough survivor who lives in an abandoned building and survives through scavenging. Uncouth and untouched by any civilizing influences, she has smoked and cursed since an early age. She is also elusive and wary of other people until Meridian seizes her.
