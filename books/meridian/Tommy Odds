Tommy Odds is a friend of Trumanâ€™s who works on voter-registration drives in Mississippi. Tommy is dedicated and charismatic, and he is successful at getting more southern blacks to register and vote. Later, his less appealing qualities emerge, as his anger and resentment over losing part of his arm boil over into rape and other violence. His desire for revenge and his wish to blame Lynne for his troubles blind him to reason and mute his otherwise kind and generous nature.
