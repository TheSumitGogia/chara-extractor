Camden Farebrother is a Vicar, but he doesn't consider himself to be a very good clergyman, though many people like his sensible sermons. He becomes fast friends with Lydgate and supports his mother, sister, and aunt on his small income. He must gamble to make ends meet and to pursue his scientific hobbies. He loses in the election for the chaplaincy at the New Hospital. He receives the Lowick parish after Casaubon's death. Fred Vincy enlists his help in courting Mary Garth. He himself loves Mary, but he does his duty.
