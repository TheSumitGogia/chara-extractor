Captain James Purrinton is Martha’s neighbor, who murders his family before committing suicide. Sober, industrious, taciturn James is a respected member of the local militia, and, before the murders, Martha bakes for James and often trades goods with the rest of the family. Early historians have theorized that James diverts from his original plan to only commit suicide because he needs to control his family’s future. A Universalist, he believes that everyone will be saved regardless of their actions.
