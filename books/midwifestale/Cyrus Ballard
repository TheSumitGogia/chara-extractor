Cyrus Ballard is Martha’s oldest son. Quiet and unmarried, Cyrus follows miller jobs wherever they become available and moves in and out of his parents’ house until he is in his early forties. Having developed powerful shoulders through his years of re-chiseling mill stones, Cyrus is a great help to Martha whenever he is in town. Though no mention of it is made in the diary, Ulrich theorizes that Cyrus had great difficulty achieving independence due to some sort of mental impairment.
