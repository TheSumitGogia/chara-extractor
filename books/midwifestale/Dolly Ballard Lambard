Dolly Ballard Lambard is Martha’s youngest daughter. The only daughter to develop a specific career of her own, Dolly trains and begins working as a dressmaker for a period of time before her marriage to Barnabas Lambard. Dolly is a hard, uncomplaining worker, and she assists her mother during her midwiving and nursing duties, though she is not always sympathetic enough to Martha’s needs. Dolly is left in charge of Martha’s papers after she dies, and she passes the diary on to her daughters.
