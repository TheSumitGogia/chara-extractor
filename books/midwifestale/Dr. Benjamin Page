Dr. Benjamin Page is a Hallowell physician who sometimes works with Martha. Page is intent on developing an obstetrics practice rather than arriving during emergencies like most physicians, and Martha thinks him bumbling enough to record more than one of his mistakes for posterity. His skill improves with experience, however, and during the years when Martha delivers fewer babies, he is one of the main people whom the expectant mothers request.
