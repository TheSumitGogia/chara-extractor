Ephraim Ballard is Marthaâ€™s husband. A surveyor for most of his life, Ephraim is a well-respected man who holds several positions of authority and trust within the community. Ephraim is calm and independent and generally lets Martha have full authority over her duties and whereabouts. He angers Martha only when he feels she is complaining too much about the help. Finally sick of being attacked, Ephraim quits his surveying job and becomes a tax collector. Though the job leads him to being jailed for debt, Ephraim seems to see his confinement almost as a period of relaxation. When he is home, however, Ephraim is a great help around the house and generally a good friend to Martha.
