Hannah Ballard Pollard is One of Martha’s daughters. A quiet, dutiful girl who masters all of the domestic skills necessary to set up a good household of her own, Hannah is the only daughter living at home during the course of the diary who isn’t mentioned in conjunction with directly helping with her mother’s nursing duties. After her marriage to Moses Pollard, Hannah’s focus seems to be on her own large family. Still, Hannah’s birth so close to the death of her sisters may have led to a special relationship between her and Martha, as she is the only child listed at Martha’s bedside in the diary’s final entry.
