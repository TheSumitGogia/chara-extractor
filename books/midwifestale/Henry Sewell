Henry Sewell is Another Hallowell diarist often quoted by Ulrich. Martha’s neighbor and occasional employer, Sewell is very conservative in his religious beliefs and is a major force behind driving the Fosters out of town. Sewell is highly patriotic and attuned to ceremony, and he disapproves of any activity that even hints of scandal. In his diary, he offers a very male perspective of the time—that is, he seems completely oblivious to the daily rhythms of life going on around him. Even the birth of one of his children is recorded only in Martha’s diary, not in his.
