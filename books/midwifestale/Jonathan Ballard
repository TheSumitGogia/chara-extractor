Jonathan Ballard is Martha’s middle son. Jonathan is brash and drinks too much, and his fits of temper are a source of contention between him and Martha for much of her life. On more than one occasion, Martha records fights that Jonathan has instigated with neighbors, and though the rest of the family learns to accept these brawls, Martha’s descriptions indicate that she remains opposed to his behavior. Despite his temper, Jonathan is very aware of his responsibilities. He marries Sally when she gives birth to his child, and he makes sure his mother is taken care of even if it isn’t in the way she might have wanted. Ephraim’s declared heir, Jonathan has occasional problems with debt but works hard to raise the fortunes of himself and his children.
