Judge Joseph North is Martha’s neighbor who is accused of rape. A well-respected member of the community, North seems to feel sympathy for the woman he is accused of attacking. He is acquitted of Rebecca Foster’s rape charges and seems to suffer no lasting effects on his career. Martha and her family, however, never forgive him, and her daughters go out of their way to have someone else officiate at their weddings.
