Martha Moore Ballard is a Hallowell midwife and the protagonist ofA Midwife’s Tale. A reserved woman, Martha deeply values her own autonomy and avoids passing judgment on others. However, she is very firm in her own opinions and finds ways of making her displeasure known when she or someone she likes is slighted. Though Martha rarely says so explicity, her actions show that she loves her family and has a comfortable, mutually helpful marriage with Ephraim. Martha takes her duties as a nurse and midwife very seriously, giving help to anyone who needs it, no matter what their position in society or her own life situation. Deeply religious, Martha is aware of God’s power and influence in her life even when she doesn’t attend meetings. Like all women, Martha occasionally feels very tired and sorry for herself, and during these times, the diary serves as an outlet for the feelings she can’t share with her family.
