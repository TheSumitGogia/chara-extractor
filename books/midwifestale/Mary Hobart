Mary Hobart is Martha’s great-great-granddaughter, who inherited the diary. A practicing physician in the late 1800s, Mary is one of the first women allowed into the once exclusively male Massachusetts Medical Society. Mary cherishes Martha’s diary, admiring her great-grandmother’s skill and professionalism and feeling a deep kinship with her. She donates the diary to the Maine State Library to keep it safe and give others greater accessibility to it. Though highly disappointed by the deletions in the incomplete transcript they give her in return, Mary is gracious enough to thank the library for their efforts.
