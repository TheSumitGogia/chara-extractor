Parthenia Barton Pitts is One of Martha’s nieces. Sent by her mother, Dorothy Barton, to live with Martha as a teenager, Parthenia likes the arrangement so well that she stays with Martha until she marries Shubael Pitts and sets up a household of her own. A patient, uncomplaining worker, Parthenia assists Martha both through housework and by watching patients when Martha can’t do so herself. Baptized during her final illness, Martha commends the niece she thinks of as a daughter on her patience and Christian meekness. Parthenia dies at a young age.
