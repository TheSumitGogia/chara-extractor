Rev. Isaac Foster is a local preacher who Martha likes. Somewhat more radical in his religious beliefs than many town leaders, Foster is given to suing his enemies and is eventually dismissed from his position. Looking for work out of town at the time, Foster seems able to do little to defend his wifeâ€™s safety or reputation from the abuse of town leaders. Eventually, he and his family are forced to flee Hallowell in disgrace and debt. The same traits that brought him and Rebecca such trouble in Hallowell also get them chased out of several other towns. Eventually, they find a town that accepts their eccentricities.
