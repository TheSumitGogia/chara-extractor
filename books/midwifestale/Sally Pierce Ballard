Sally Pierce Ballard is Jonathan’s wife and Martha’s daughter-in-law. A strong woman who knows what she wants, Sally has no trouble claiming Jonathan as the father of her daughter and pressuring him until he agrees to marry her. This strength of will gives both her and Martha considerable difficulty when they live under the same roof, each fighting to be mistress of the same space. Though she often complains of Martha’s inflexibility, the entries suggest that she behaves similarly when living as a widow under her own son’s roof. Sally cares very much for her sister Hitty and occasionally fulfills nursing needs in the neighborhood.
