Joanne is James’s psychologist at the clinic. Like all staff members at the facility, she is a recovering addict. Joanne is the first to recognize that the best way to deal with James is to let him make his own decisions. She presses gently and knows when the time is right to let him have his own way. She’s well traveled and worldly.
