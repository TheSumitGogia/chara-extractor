John is One of James’s first roommates at the clinic. John is an ex-con who was molested by his father as a child. He is also a trust-fund baby, something that James can relate to. John is one of the strangest patients James encounters: when he meets people, he gives them a business card advertising himself as a “Sexual Ninja” and explains that he is addicted to anal sex.
