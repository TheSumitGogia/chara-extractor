Lincoln is Unit supervisor at the clinic. Lincoln is the resident tough guy, the person who is called in when the patients get physically out of control. Although gruff, Lincoln can also be a kind person. He constantly butts heads with James but is made to see Jamesâ€™s reasoning each time they encounter each other. Near the end of the story, Lincoln and James set aside their differences and reach a level of mutual respect.
