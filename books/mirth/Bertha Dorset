Bertha Dorset is the wife of George Dorset. Most of the characters (including perhaps her husband) know that she has a history of extramarital affairs, one of which may have been with Lawrence Selden. She is described as a nasty woman who enjoys making other people miserable, especially her own husband. She invites Lily on a cruise with her, her husband, and Ned Silverton around the Mediterranean, but only so Lily will distract George while Bertha has an affair with Ned. Bertha, the novel's antagonist, spreads the rumor that Lily and George are having an affair, then uses her money and influence to keep Lily out of society forever.Read anin-depth analysis of Bertha Dorset.
