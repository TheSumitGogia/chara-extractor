Albert Cluveau is an old Cajun man who fishes near Jane's cabin each day and who shoots Ned Douglass. Initially Cluveau is a friendly character, even though he speaks frequently about killing people. He and Jane are even friends. Cluveau's willingness to shoot Ned shows him as a coward. Cluveau is a poor white Cajun who will follow the orders of the higher-ranking whites in order to get their acceptance. After Cluveau believes that Jane has cursed him, his status as a weak coward becomes more obvious since he fears going to hell so much that he beats his innocent daughter. Cluveau is so afraid of death that he screams for days before it comes. This cowardice toward the end of his life contrasts strongly with the bravery showed by Ned Douglass, the man he shot.
