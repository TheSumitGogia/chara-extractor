Brady is a older black man on the Samson plantation who is supposed to drive Miss Jane to town on the day of the protest at the courthouse. Brady is too scared to do so, however. His fear is representative of the fear felt by most of the black people in the area because of years of abuse and control by the whites. Because Brady is an older black man, his inability to stand up for that in which he believes also suggests the way in which the southern order emasculated black men into inaction.
