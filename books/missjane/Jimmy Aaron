Jimmy Aaron is a boy born in the plantation whom everyone believes is going to be the "one". Jimmy Aaron is a messiah-like figure who will return to help mobilize the community toward action. The elders on the plantation want Jimmy to become a religious leader, but because of the changes in Civil Rights he becomes more interested in politics. Jimmy Aaron's commitment and the final sacrifice of his life truly saves the other people from the fear that has governed them all their life.
