Jimmy Caya is Tee Bob's best friend, whom he met at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. Jimmy Caya is not from the high landowning class like the Samsons, and Jules Raynard looks down on him for that reason. Jimmy Caya is young, like Tee Bob, but Jimmy Caya maintains the classic southern ideas on race. Any meaningful relationship between Tee Bob and a black woman is unthinkable in his eyes, as it is for most white men. After he learns of Tee Bob's death, he responds in the classic southern white way: he wants to blame the girl that Tee Bob loved and have her killed. He serves as a contrast to Tee Bob, who was willing to stretch the confining social limitations that society placed upon him. Caya's character articulates the racist status quo, while simultaneously demonstrating the classicism within the white southern sphere.
