Job is a poor white man who takes Jane and Ned to his house when they are fleeing slavery. His wife has gone crazy during the war, and he has little to share with them, but he does so anyway and takes them to the safe location of Mr. Bone's plantation. He represents kindness in the face of so much evil. Like his biblical namesake, he is a man who has seemingly endured much but who still maintains a sense of goodness and Godliness by being charitable.
