Madame Gautier is a Creole "hoodoo" woman whom Jane consults. Madame Gautier moved to a country town from New Orleans because of the competition in the city. Madame Gautier speaks with a funny accent in order to affect a spiritual tone. In many ways, she is a comedic figure because her affectations suggest that she is just a plain black woman dressed up and acting like a sorceress for financial gain.
