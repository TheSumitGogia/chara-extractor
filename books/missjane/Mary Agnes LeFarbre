Mary Agnes LeFarbre is the Creole schoolteacher that comes to live on the Samson plantation and with whom Tee Bob falls in love. Mary Agnes came to the plantation in an effort to make amends for her family's slaveholding past. Most of the plantation, however, believes her to be slightly uppity, because of her background. Her desire to be with dark skinned people is equally as racist as her Creole family's desire to only be with whites. Mary Agnes is somewhat of a coquette, as she continues to befriend Tee Bob but na√Øvely assumes that nothing will come of it. She never considered the relationship between them serious. Her attitude, to a great extent, leads to his death.
