Robert Samson is the Master of the Samson Plantation and the father of Tee Bob. Robert Samson represents the old southern social order. He governs his plantation almost as men did during slavery. He seduces a black woman and fathers a child, Timmy, but he refuses to accept this son as his own because he is black. Timmy lives on the plantation and resembles him more than Samson's white son, but for Samson the color barrier between them is larger than their blood connection. Samson's inability to see beyond the old southern order leads to his rejection of Timmy and the death of his other son, Tee Bob. Because of his archaic beliefs, his legacy is ruined.
