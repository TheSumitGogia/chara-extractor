Sheriff Guidry is the local Sheriff in town. He is a classic white southern sheriff who seems totally indifferent to justice in the wake of Tee Bob's death. He supports Jules Raynard when Raynard begs for peace, but it seems just as likely that he would look away if the Samson family proceeded with violence.
