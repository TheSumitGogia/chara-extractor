Tee Bob is the son of Robert Samson, the owner of the Sampson Plantation. Tee Bob is a tragic figure who kills himself during the book because he cannot accept the social mores of the South. Tee Bob's first disappointment with the Southern order comes when his father forces his half-brother, Timmy, off the plantation. Tee Bob cannot understand why Timmy has to leave because the white overseer beat him. Tee Bob's later love for Mary Agnes again steps outside of the rules proscribed by their culture. No one, not even Mary Agnes, supports Tee Bob's love of her. When she turns him down, he sees that the world is too harsh for him, and he kills himself. Tee Bob's love for his brother and for Mary Agnes is pure, and he cannot understand why anything can be wrong with them. Tee Bob in many ways still maintains a sense of racial superiority because he is white, but the kind nature of his heart makes him willing to step outside the rules. And it is his willingness that leads to his dismay and suicide.
