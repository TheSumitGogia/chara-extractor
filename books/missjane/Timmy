Timmy is the unrecognized son of Robert Samson. Timmy looks and acts just like Robert Samson, but because Timmy is the son of a black woman he cannot claim Robert Samson's name. Timmy's knowledge of who is father is makes him slightly more obstinate than other blacks. Timmy is not entirely a likeable character because he is so hardheaded and mischievous, but he is a sympathetic one. His father exiles him from the plantation eventually because Timmy's attitude is not becoming of a black man. Timmy yearns to be the man that he is, but despite his heritage, his black race still requires that he cower in a white man's world. Timmy's presence is a testament to the widespread existence of black children of white men and the longtime rejection of them by their fathers both during and after slavery.
