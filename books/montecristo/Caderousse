Caderousse is a lazy, drunk, and greedy man. Caderousse is present when the plot to frame DantÃ¨s is hatched, but he does  not take an active part in the crime. Unlike Danglars  and Mondego, Caderousse never finds his fortune,  instead making his living through petty crime and the occasional murder.
