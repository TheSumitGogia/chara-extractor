Franklin Blake, Lady Verinder's nephew, is the editorial force behind the collected narratives of the novelâ€”he has asked everyone to write what they know about the disappearance of the diamond, in the interests of clearing his own name. Franklin is good-natured and somewhat indecisive, perhaps because of his training in various foreign countries. Franklin is in love with Rachel Verinder.
