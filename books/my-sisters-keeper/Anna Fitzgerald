Anna Fitzgerald is the youngest Fitzgerald child and the protagonist of the novel. Described                 by her father as their family’s constant, thirteen-year-old Anna is smart, funny,                 and observant. Anna’s actions drive the plot, as she struggles to reconcile her                 knowledge that only she can provide Kate, whom she loves dearly, with the organs she                 needs to survive and her desire to live without this extraordinary burden. While the                 rest of the family has often been left to sit idly by in Kate’s fight against                 cancer, Anna, because her genes match Kate’s, has been an active participant. Anna’s                 role in Kate’s survival has been a blessing and a curse for her, as it has made her                 Kate’s savior but has also made Anna unable to be her own person.
