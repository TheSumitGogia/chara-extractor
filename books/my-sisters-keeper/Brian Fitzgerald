Brian Fitzgerald is the father of the Fitzgerald children and a career firefighter. Brian                 often serves as a foil to Sara. In contrast to her, he can view the situation from                 his childrenâ€™s perspectives, making him both more perceptive and understanding than                 Sara at times. Yet Brian also escapes into his work to avoid dealing with the                 hardships surrounding his family. He can be kinder than Sara, but by the end of the                 story Sara proves to be the emotionally stronger of the two.
