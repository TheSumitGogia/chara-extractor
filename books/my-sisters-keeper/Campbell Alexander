Campbell Alexander is Annaâ€™s lawyer. Initially arrogant and brusque, Campbell gradually emerges                 as a character with many layers. In many ways, he mirrors Anna. Both have found it                 difficult to be who their parents want them to be, and both have secrets they are                 unwilling to share. Campbell struggles between his urge to erect barriers around                 himself and his genuine desire to reach out to people. He ultimately experiences the                 most personal growth of any of the characters, and by the end of the story he has                 formed strong bonds with the people around him.Read anin-depth analysis of Campbell Alexander.
