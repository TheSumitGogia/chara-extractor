Jesse Fitzgerald is the oldest of the Fitzgerald children and the most delinquent. Despite                 his tough exterior, Jesse is in reality a vulnerable and sensitive character. He                 uses his destructive behavior to mask a fundamental feeling of inadequacy. Jesse                 cannot save Kate, and he has never been able to forgive himself for that. In                 addition, he has often felt ignored by his parents, who focus their attention almost                 exclusively on Kate, and he acts out in part to gain their                 attention.
