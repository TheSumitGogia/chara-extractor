Judge (the dog) is Campbellâ€™s service dog. Campbell does not reveal why he needs Judge for                 most of the book. Ultimately he reveals that Judge is an epilepsy service dog,                 meaning he alerts Campbell if a seizure is imminent so Campbell can move to a safe                 environment.
