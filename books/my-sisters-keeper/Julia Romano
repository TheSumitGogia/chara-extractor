Julia Romano is Guardian ad litem to Anna and Campbell’s high-school girlfriend. Julia                 has a genuine desire to discover what is best for Anna and is one of the most open                 and caring characters in the story. She possesses an independent personality that                 made her an outsider in high school but now makes her ideally suited for rendering                 an objective opinion on Anna’s case.             Julia never truly recovered from the way her and Campbell’s relationship                 ended, yet she still retains her ability to care deeply about                 people.
