Kate Fitzgerald is the middle Fitzgerald child and the focal point of many of the novel’s                 events. Kate’s cancer is at the heart of the story, but she only narrates the                 prologue and epilogue. She has struggled with cancer nearly her entire life, and she                 appears to have come to terms with the fact that she might die. The reader sees                 glimpses of the girl Kate could have been, but for the most part her battle with                 cancer defines her character.
