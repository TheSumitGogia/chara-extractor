Sara Fitzgerald is the mother of the Fitzgerald family. Sara is strong, stubborn, and                 intelligent, and her life centers on her efforts to keep Kate alive. She has                 extremely strong maternal instincts, but her single-minded focus on saving Kate                 sometimes exists at the expense of her marriage and her relationships with her two                 other children. Even so, she has a deep and abiding love for all her family, though                 she does not always know how to show that love.
