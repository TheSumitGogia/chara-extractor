Zanne is Saraâ€™s older sister. Zanne, a high-powered career woman without children,                 provides a foil to Sara, who could have been a successful attorney but essentially                 gave up her law career to care for her children full-time. Zanne often gives Brian                 and Sara comfort and support. For instance, she watches Anna and Jesse when Sara                 goes with Kate to the hospital and Brian has to work. Her relationship with Sara                 offers another example of the unique bond that exists between                 sisters.
