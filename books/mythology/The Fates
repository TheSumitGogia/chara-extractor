The Fates is Three mysterious sisters who affect the paths of all in the universe. Clotho spins the thread of life, Lachesis assigns each personâ€™s thread, and Atropos snips the thread of life at its end. Since fate is the only force to rule above both gods and men, the fates arguably have more power than anyone else in the Greek universe.
