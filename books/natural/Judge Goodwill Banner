Judge Goodwill Banner is the owner of the New York Knights. Judge prefers hi steam to lose, as this allows him to run the organization cheaply. He is crooked and often bets against his own players. He attempts to bribe Roy into throwing the game for the pennant. Judge lives in a tower high above the ballpark, scheming ways to make money and to take back Pop Fisher's remaining forty percent of the team's stock.
