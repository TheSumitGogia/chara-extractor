Something of a character itself, Wonderboy is Roy's bat. When Roy was a boy, he came across a tree that had been struck by lightning, and he decided to make a bat out of it. In the mythological world ofThe Natural,Wonderboy is Roy's Excalibur. It is also an unquestionable phallic symbol; when Roy is in a slump, the bat is said to "sag like a baloney." It is implied that the bat gives Roy extra strength that he might not have had otherwise, allowing him to hit bad pitches.
