Marquis de Rollebon is Although not a character in the novel per se, he is the subject of Roquentin's research. He was a mysterious French aristocrat who meddled in politics during and after the French Revolution. At first Roquentin thinks he can learn everything about him, but soon realizes that not only is he guessing about who the marquis really was, but he is also using him to justify his existence. Roquentin's rejection of Rollebon is thus a rejection of living in the past.
