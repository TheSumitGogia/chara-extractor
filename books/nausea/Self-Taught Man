Self-Taught Man is a lonely man whom Roquentin meets at the Bouville Library. Roquentin mocks him for thinking he can learn all there is to know by reading everything in the Library in alphabetical order. He is a defender of humanism, believing that all men and women are united by the common bond of love. He is later chased out of town for fondling a small boy in public.
