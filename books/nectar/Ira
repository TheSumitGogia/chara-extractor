Ira is Rukmani’s daughter, her first child. Ira is named for the great Irawaddy River because water is so precious. Ira is more beautiful than either of her parents and has a sweet, obedient, uncomplaining nature. She sings like a bird. When her husband abandons her because she is barren, she falls into a depression lifted only by the birth of her youngest brother, Kuti. She devotes herself to him with great determination, as she later does to her own illegitimate albino son.
