Old Granny is a woman without family who barely scrapes a living selling produce in the village. Old Granny remains friendly with Rukmani even after Rukmani stops selling garden produce to her. At Rukmani’s request, Old Granny arranges what all consider a good marriage for Ira. Old Granny never forgives herself for the failure of that marriage, and she brings a rupee as a gift when Ira’s baby is born, when she herself is starving.
