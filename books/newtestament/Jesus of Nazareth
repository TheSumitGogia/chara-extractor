Jesus of Nazareth is the central figure of the New Testament, whose life, death, and resurrection are chronicled in the books. The four Gospels describe Jesusâ€™s life until his resurrection, and the remainder of the New Testament concerns itself with the community of followers of Jesus that steadily grows after his death.
