Polyphemus is One of the Cyclopes (uncivilized one-eyed giants) whose island Odysseus comes to soon after leaving Troy. Polyphemus imprisons Odysseus and his crew and tries to eat them, but Odysseus blinds him  through a clever ruse and manages to escape. In  doing so, however, Odysseus angers Polyphemusâ€™s father, Poseidon.
