John Osborne is a scientist with CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. More than any other character, John faces the reality of his impending death and uses his last few months to fulfill his dreams. Traveling on the submarine and racing his Ferrari give him the chance to break from his mundane lifestyle. Attracted to wealth and exclusivity, Osborne joins the fancy and formal Pastoral Club. Often cynical, he is described by Moira as "dippy." He gets nervous easily, but tries—usually successfully—to hide his fears. As a scientist and engineer, John is the character with whom Shute could most readily identify. For this reason, he describes, but never mocks, John's love for machines.
