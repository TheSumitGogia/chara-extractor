Peter Holmes is a lieutenant commander in the Royal Australian Navy. Peter, like Dwight, is a real Navy man who longs to go to the sea even if it means leaving his wife, Mary, and baby daughter, Jennifer, during their last few months alive. When Holmes is not working, his time is consumed with domestic matters, such as gardening and shopping. He does his best to take care of his family. On the whole, he is very much an ordinary man, written that way intentionally so that we might easily relate to him.
