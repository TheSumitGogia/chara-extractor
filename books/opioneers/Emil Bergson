Emil Bergson is the youngest son of John Bergson, and the younger brother of Oscar, Lou, and Alexandra. Emil reaps the advantages of Alexandra's financial success: freed from the obligations of farm work, he is able to go to college and explore the world. He grows up tall, handsome, and athletic--a shining emblem of America's immense promise. Tragically, however, Emil falls in love with his flirtatious neighbor Marie Shabata; he is killed, along with her, by her husband, Frank.
