Lou Bergson is the second son of John Bergson, and the brother of Alexandra, Oscar, and Emil. Lou is relatively intelligent, but he is also devious, small-minded, and vicious. He marries Annie Lee and settles into a life of scheming and small-time politics. He is less creative and flexible than Alexandra, and, like his older brother Oscar, he resents the relationship between Alexandra and Carl Linstrum.
