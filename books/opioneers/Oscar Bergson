Oscar Bergson is the oldest son of John Bergson, the younger brother of Alexandra, and the older brother of Lou and Emil. Oscar is a hard worker, but mentally sluggish and uncreative. Like his smarter brother Lou, he resents Alexandra for her financial success, her unconventional ways, and her relationship with Carl Linstrum.
