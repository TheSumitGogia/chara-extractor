Katy is Jeanette's second long term lover. Katy's character is confident, open, and unashamed. Katy's obviously sexual invitation to Jeanette demonstrates to Jeanette a new confidence about same sex relations. Katy contrasts with the character of Melanie in that Katy understands what she is doing with Jeanette, but lacks any shame about her behavior. Not surprisingly, their confidence and happiness leads to their being caught. Still while they are caught, the capture differs greatly from the time that Melanie and Jeanette were found out. Katy has helped to instill Jeanette with confidence in her self and her sexuality.
