Melanie is Jeanette's first lover. Jeanette meets Melanie at a fish stand. Melanie's character is sweet, docile, and not too smart. Initially, Melanie tells Jeanette that she got her name because her head resembled a melonâ€” a wry comment also upon Melanie's limited intellectual capacity. Melanie's docility leads her to later marry, have children, and deny that she ever had a lesbian love. Melanie represents another weak soul who refuses to follow her true desires and venture outside of the role society has placed upon her, unlike Jeanette. Her weak characters helps to highlight the strength of Jeanette's.
