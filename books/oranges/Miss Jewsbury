Miss Jewsbury is a member of Jeanette's church who plays the oboe. Miss Jewsbury represents the closeted lesbian that Jeanette refuses to become. Miss Jewsbury's character is awkward, slightly unfriendly, and generally disdained by others who deem her unholy, because of her latent sexual desires. Still, Miss Jewsbury's inability to choose either her lesbianism or her religion leaves her as a character torn between two contradictory worlds. She can never live with a full identity. After Jeanette has liberated herself by choosing her sexuality over her community, she declines to visit Miss Jewsbury who lacked the courage to make a similar choice.
