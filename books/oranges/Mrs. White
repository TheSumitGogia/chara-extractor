Mrs. White is a very religious member of Jeanette's church. As her name indicates, Mrs. White appears to be of the utmost purity. With Jeanette's mother, she represents one of the church members who holds very unbending ideas about sin and goodness. The narrator frequently uses Mrs. White's allegedly purity for comic effect. While Mrs. White is supposedly devout, she grabs a wine glass to better eavesdrop on the fornication at the next-door neighbors, an act of a gossip rather than a saint. Further, Mrs. White's eventual difficulty in breathing because of her proximity to a lesbian seems ludicrous.
