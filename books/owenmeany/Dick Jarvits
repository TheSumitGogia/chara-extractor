Dick Jarvits is the boy who kills Owen Meany. A hulking, sadistic fifteen-year-old from a trashy family in Phoenix. Dick lives for the day when he will be old enough to travel to Vietnam; he dreams of slaughtering the Viet Cong. Owen is assigned to return the body of Dick's dead brother. When Dick sees Owen escorting a group of Vietnamese orphans into a men's room, he throws a grenade into the room. Owen is killed in the act of saving the children's lives.
