Harriet Wheelwright is John's maternal grandmother, a domineering, aristocratic woman who loves her family very deeply. Descended from John Adams, and having married into the most prominent family in Gravesend, Mrs. Wheelwright is the matriarch of the town in her old age, and represents aristocracy and New England propriety throughout the novel. Mrs. Wheelwright maintains a manor at 80 Front Street in Gravesend, where John is largely raised and where many of the novel's most important events take place.
