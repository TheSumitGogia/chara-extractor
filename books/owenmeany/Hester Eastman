Hester Eastman is John's youngest cousin (about a year older than he is), for whom John feels a bizarre, quasi-sexual attraction as a young man. Hester is extremely bitter about the inequitable treatment she receives from her parents, believing that they favor her brothers, and remains an angry, sexually and emotionally aggressive woman. By 1987, Hester has become a rock star, performing under the name "Hester the Molester." During their adolescence, Hester becomes romantically and possibly sexually involved with Owen Meany, and develops a passionate, fatalistic attachment to him. In the novel, Hester gives Irving an instrument for introducing the murky element of sexuality and gender relations into the lives of his boy-heroes. Like John, she remains deeply damaged by Owen's death for the rest of her life.
