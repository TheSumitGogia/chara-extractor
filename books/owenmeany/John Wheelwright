John Wheelwright is Owen Meany's best friend, the narrator of the novel. The son of Tabby Wheelwright and Rev. Louis Merrill (though he does not know who his father is until the end of the novel), John is raised by the aristocratic Wheelwright family in Gravesend, New Hampshire. As a young man he is led to religious faith by the life of his best friend Owen Meany, and in 1987, he decides to write down Owen's story and to chronicle the awakening of his own belief in God. Though he has an active religious life, John is also extremely bitter and furiously angry about his experience, and frequently launches into lengthy diatribes against the Reagan administration. As a middle-aged man, he remains a virgin, "neutered," he says, by the things that have happened to him. In the novel, John serves both as a fixed perspective and as a contrast to the character of Owen Meany, a passive foil for Owen's charismatic dynamism.
