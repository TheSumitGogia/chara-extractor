Owen Meany is John's best friend, a dwarf with weirdly luminous skin and a high-pitched, nasal voice represented in the novel in all capital letters. Owen's father runs a granite quarry; some of Owen's eccentricities may be due to the inhalation of granite dust at an early age. Despite his tiny size, Owen is a powerful personality, often dominating situations and telling adults what to do even when he is a young child. Owen possesses a powerful and personal religious faith, believing himself to be God's instrument on Earth; he also believes that everything that happens is fated, and that his own dreams are prophecies of his future purpose in life. (As it turns out at the end of the novel, he is right.) When Owen and John are eleven, Owen accidentally kills John's mother when a foul ball he hits at a Little League game breaks her neck. Throughout the novel, Owen represents the relationship between the earthly and the spiritual, as well as the avocation of faith.
