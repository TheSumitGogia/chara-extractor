Amory Blaine is the protagonist whose development the novel chronicles. Amory grows up with his sophisticated mother, Beatrice, until he leaves for boarding school. He then attends Princeton University and falls in love with several women, of whom Rosalind has the most traumatic impact (she breaks his heart by leaving him to marry a wealthier man). Amory is extraordinarily handsome and somewhat egocentric. He enjoys idling with friends, has literary ambitions, and ultimately achieves some portion of self-knowledge, though at the cost of losing his money and his dearest friends.
