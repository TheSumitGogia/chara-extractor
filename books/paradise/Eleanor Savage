Eleanor Savage is a young, wild girl, educated in France, whom Amory meets on a rainy haystack in Maryland. The two have an intense summer romance, sharing a love of literature. They can almost read each others' thoughts, but Amory feels like he is incapable of love at this point. The romance ends when Eleanor sends her horse charging toward a cliff, but throws herself off the horse just before it plummets to its death.
