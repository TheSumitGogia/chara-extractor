Alice Greer is Taylor's mother. At the beginning of the book, she still lives in rural Kentucky, but she runs away from her old life when she comes out west to visit her daughter. She is a strong, lonely woman, craving a community that could provide her the comfort and warmth that her husband Harland cannot. Like Taylor, she has a spunky, determined spirit, and a strong love for her daughter and granddaughter.
