Cash Stillwater is a Cherokee man living in Wyoming. Cash suffers the losses of the women in his family, including his dead wife and daughter Alma. As Turtle's biological grandfather, he also suffers as the result of her disappearance from the Nation. Cash also is a little misguided. Like his name implies, he seems to always be concocting new get-rich-quick ideas, and is lured by the false promise of happiness that money brings. Cash knows how to cook and loves to talk; he also has a strong sense of home rooted in the Cherokee Nation.
