Sugar Hornbuckle is the face on theLifemagazine advertisement. She was photographed on the Cherokee Nation, in front of a sign that read "Welcome to Heaven," the small town where she has lived for all of her adult life. Sugar and Alice are second cousins, and were close companions growing up. Now a grandma, Sugar is still kind and warm, and loves her home and family on the Nation.
