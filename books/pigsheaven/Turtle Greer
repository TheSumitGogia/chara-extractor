Turtle Greer is the adopted Cherokee daughter of Taylor. When Taylor found her in a car on the Cherokee Nation three years prior, Turtle had been sexually abused, and appeared to be half-dead. Now a bright and charming little girl, Turtle still harbors fears of her past She feels threatened whenever she is separated from anyone, most of all Taylor. She sparks the beginning of conflict in the book when she insists that she saw a man who fell down from the Hoover Dam. Quiet and uncomplaining by nature, she was named for the snapping turtles in Kentucky that keep a firm grip on whatever they bite.
