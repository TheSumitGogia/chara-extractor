Ginny Weasley is Ron Weasley’s pretty, popular younger sister. Harry develops strong feelings for Ginny but prevents himself from acting on them because he is afraid of jeopardizing his relationship with Ron. Eventually, after an especially triumphant Quidditch match, Harry kisses her, to Ron’s approval. Like Ron, Ginny is extremely brave, and she has fought with the Order of the Phoenix and is a member of Dumbledore’s Army, the group of students who banded together to study Defense Against the Dark Arts in the previous novel in the series.
