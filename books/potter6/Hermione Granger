Hermione Granger is One of Harry Potter’s two best friends. Hermione is an extremely conscientious student, her hand perpetually in the air during class. In addition to being highly intelligent, Hermione is also the more cautious of Harry’s friends, constantly challenging his quick thinking and lack of foresight. Hermione is a Mudblood, meaning she is a wizard born to Muggle parents. Many Slytherins, including Draco Malfoy, deride her for this condition.
