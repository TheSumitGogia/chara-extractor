Arthur Weasley is the father of the Weasley family, and an employee of the Ministry of Magic. Arthur has always had a fondness for and curiosity about the Muggle (non-wizarding) world, which has kept him from advancing very far in his career at the Ministry. When Voldemortâ€™s Death Eaters take over the Ministry, his safety is imperiled as well.
