Dolores Umbridge is Formerly (and briefly) the head of Hogwarts, and now a senior member of the Ministry of Magic. Umbridge is thoroughly evil, delighting in punishing others and using rules and regulations to persecute people, though she is apparently not one of Voldemortâ€™s Death Eaters. She is in charge of finding and punishing Mudbloods for the Ministry.
