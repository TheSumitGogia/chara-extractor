Neville Longbottom is a student in Harry’s class, who for most of the series has been a pathetic weakling, unable to remember his lessons or perform magic properly. In previous novels we learn that his parents were Aurors (Dark wizard hunters) who were tortured and driven insane by the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange. In this novel, he transforms himself into the heroic leader of Dumbledore’s Army and the underground resistance to Snape, filling Harry’s role in his absence.
