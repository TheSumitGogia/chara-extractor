Miss Bornstein is a young Jewish woman who arrives to teach at the Barberton primary school while Peekay is studying there. She becomes a mentor to Peekay and helps him to win a scholarship to the prestigious private boys school in Johannesburg, the Prince of Wales school. Her grandfather, Mr. Bornstein, becomes Doc's chess partner. Peekay is stupefied by Miss Bornstein's beauty-she has thick dark hair, bright green eyes, a perfect complexion, and a perfect smile. She continues to write copious study notes for Peekay after he leaves for the Prince of Wales school. Peekay and Morrie eventually publish these notes and sell them. They help to establish the famous "Miss Bornstein Correspondence School," of which Miss Bornstein becomes the principal.
