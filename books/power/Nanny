Nanny is Peekay's Zulu wet nurse. She brings Peekay up telling him stories of warriors and women washing by the baboon's water hole. When Peekay prays as a child, he prays not to God, but to his nanny. She summons the great Inkosi-Inkosikazi to cure Peekay's bedwetting problem. As a result, Peekay brings great honor on her because she has the chance to flaunt her story-telling skills in front of the medicine man. When Peekay arrives in Barberton, he is distraught to find that his beloved Nanny is not there. Peekay learns that Nanny had an argument with his mother-Nanny refused to remove her charms and amulets in accordance with Peekay's mother's born-again Christian beliefs.
