The Judge is a huge Afrikaans boy who traumatizes five-year-old Peekay at his first boarding school. The Judge dubs Peekay "Pisskop" and makes Peekay his personal slave and "prisoner of war." The Judge convinces Peekay that Hitler is going to march all the Englishmen in South Africa into the sea. He has a swastika tattoo on his arm. In his final torture of Peekay at school, he tries to make Peekay eat human feces. When Peekay's pet chicken, Granpa Chook, defecates into his mouth, the Judge pelts Granpa Chook to death. At the end of the novel the Judge happens to be Peekay's diamond driller in the mines. In the novel's final scene, the Judge (Botha) searches for Peekay in the Crud Bar, screaming for his blood. Peekay recognizes the tattoo on Botha's arm, and fights him until he has knocked him out. With a pocketknife, Peekay carves a Union Jack and the letters "PK" over the Judge's swastika tattoo.
