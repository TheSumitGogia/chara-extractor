William Goldman is the actual author ofThe Princess Bride,as well as many other well- reputed books and screenplays. Goldman explains that this is his favorite book, the book his father used to read to him when he was sick. He casts himself as the "good-parts editor," rewriting the original S. Morgenstern version so that we can enjoy it the way he did when he was young.
