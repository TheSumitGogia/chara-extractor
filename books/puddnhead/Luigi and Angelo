Luigi and Angelo Capello, a set of near-identical twins, appear in Dawson's Landing in reply to an ad placed by Aunt Patsy, who is looking for a boarder. They say they are looking to relax after years of traveling the world. They claim to be the children of an Italian nobleman who was forced to flee Italy after a revolution and died soon afterward. According to their story, they were enslaved by a traveling circus and put on display (in the first version of Twain's story they were Siamese twins). After several years they escaped and went into business for themselves, putting themselves on display. The twins are good-looking and smooth-talking, and the townspeople fall over themselves trying to be associated with them. Luigi has a dark secret in his past, though: he once killed a man who tried to rob them and was about to kill Angelo. Luigi's temper gets him into trouble in Dawson's Landing, too: he assaults "Tom" after "Tom" insults him. This leads to a duel in which the twins, with their old-world traditions, are only too happy to take part. While they seem suspicious, the twins are never unmasked as conmen; instead, they leave Dawson's Landing vindicated and triumphant.
