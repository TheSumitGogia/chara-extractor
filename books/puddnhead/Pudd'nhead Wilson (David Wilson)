Pudd'nhead Wilson (David Wilson) is the town eccentric, Pudd'nhead Wilson first came to Dawson's Landing intending to set up a law practice. His sense of humor proves too much for the townspeople, though, and his law practice goes nowhere. He fills his time with odd surveying and accounting jobs, and dabbles in a number of quasi-scientific hobbies, most notably fingerprinting and palmistry. Judge Driscoll is his closest friend. Pudd'nhead has also written a calendar full of clever sayings and dark proverbs, which provides the epigraphs for each chapter of the text. Pudd'nhead is an outsider, and thinks a little differently from the rest of the townspeople.
