Roxana (Roxy) is Roxana, called Roxy, begins as a slave owned by Percy Driscoll. Only one-sixteenth black, she looks white, and is described as an extremely beautiful woman. She gives birth to a son, Chambers, who will later be known as "Tom" when she switches him with another infant. Roxy is tough, intelligent, and resourceful, and, although she is freed when Percy Driscoll dies, she is the character most threatened by slavery.
