Thomas a Becket Driscoll (Tom, "Chambers") is the son of Percy Driscoll, Tom is switched with Roxy's baby Chambers when he is only a few months old, and is called "Chambers" from then on. "Chambers" is raised as a slave and is purchased by Judge Driscoll when Percy dies to prevent "Tom" from selling him "down the river." "Chambers" is a decent young man who is often forced to fight bullies for "Tom." He speaks in a black dialect.
