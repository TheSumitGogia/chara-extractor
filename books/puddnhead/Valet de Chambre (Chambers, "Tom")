Valet de Chambre (Chambers, "Tom") is Roxy's son. At a young age he is switched by his mother with Thomas a Becket Driscoll, a white child who shares his birthday and looks just like him. From then on he is known as "Tom." Raised as a white heir to a substantial estate, "Tom" is spoiled, vicious, and dissolute. His penchant for gambling leads him into debt, and his "uncle," Judge Driscoll, frequently disinherits him, only to rewrite his will again.
