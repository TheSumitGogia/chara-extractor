Julien Sorel is the central character of the novel, Julien is the nineteen-year-old son of a provincial carpenter. Ambitious, intelligent, fierce, hypocritical, and an admirer of Napoleon, Julien dreams of rising in the ranks of French society. His photographic memory gives him the opportunity to become a successful priest, but Julien wants only to be a soldier. He tries to balance the two career impulses by becoming a tutor and seducing women. Like any romantic hero, Julien falls in love with his conquests, but also never really has any idea what he is doing. What he knows of the real world comes from books, never experience. He is obsessed with becoming a modern day Napoleon, but always lets those around him choose his own path. Blind ambition leads him to forego less "glorious" opportunities and true love. His failure to succeed in both love and life is also the failure of a society that has no place for him.
