M. Valenod is a bourgeois liberal and thus M. de Rênal's nemesis. M. Valenod has made his fortune by running the local poorhouse, cheating the less fortunate of society out of what little money they have. He is jealous of Julien's affair with Mme. de Rênal and avenges his pride by voting for Julien's execution. The novel's most corrupt character, he is also its most successful in society.
