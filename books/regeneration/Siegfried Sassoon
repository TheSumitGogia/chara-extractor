Siegfried Sassoon is In real life, a distinguished soldier and Great War poet. In the novel, Sassoon is both of these things as well. He is depicted as being truthful, self- composed, morally upright, and slightly arrogant.

In the end, Sassoon returns to his duty, though he maintains his belief that the war is wrong.Read anin-depth analysis of Siegfried Sassoon.
