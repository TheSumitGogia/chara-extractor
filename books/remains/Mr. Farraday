Mr. Farraday is the new owner of Darlington Hall after Lord Darlington's death, and, as such, Stevens's new employer. Mr. Farraday is a very easygoing American gentleman, and frequently jokes around with Stevens, who does not know how to handle such "banter." Mr. Farraday does not figure very prominently in the novel.
