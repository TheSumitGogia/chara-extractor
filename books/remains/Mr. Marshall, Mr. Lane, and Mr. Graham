Mr. Marshall, Mr. Lane, and Mr. Graham is Butlers in other distinguished houses during Lord Darlington's time. When any of these men came to Darlington Hall, Stevens could look forward to a pleasant chat by the fire, in which they would discuss various problems they were having at work, or larger questions such as debating the definition of "dignity." Throughout the novel, Stevens constantly holds these men up as paragons of all that a good butler should be.
