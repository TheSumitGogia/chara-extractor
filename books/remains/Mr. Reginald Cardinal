Mr. Reginald Cardinal is Lord Darlington's godson. After Reggie Cardinal's father passes away, Lord Darlington treats the young man as his kin, though their political views differ widely. Cardinal is a journalist, and it infuriates him that the Nazis have used Lord Darlington's noble instincts to turn him into a pawn for their fascist regime. Cardinal is the one who tells Stevens directly that the Nazis have been using Lord Darlingtonâ€”Cardinal is amazed that Stevens has not noticed himself. Cardinal is later killed in the war, in Belgium.
