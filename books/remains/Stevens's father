Stevens's father is a world-class butler for many years who comes to work at Darlington Hall when he is already in his seventies and struggling with arthritis. Mr. William Stevens and his son only communicate very formally until the night the elder Stevens is on his deathbed. Stevens's father is extremely dedicated to his work as a butler; Stevens often holds him up as an example of what a "great butler" should be.
