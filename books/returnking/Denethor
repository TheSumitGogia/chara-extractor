Denethor is the Steward of Gondor and the father of Boromir and Faramir. Denethor undergoes a painful descent into madness that Tolkien uses to explore the complexity of human evil. Proud and wise, Denethor fails not because he is inherently evil, but because he allows the evil lies of thepalantírto convince him that he is incapable of saving Minas Tirith from Mordor’s power.
