Faramir is the son of Denethor, brother of the deceased Boromir, and future husband of Éowyn. Faramir appears confident and assured when Frodo and Sam encounter him at Ithilien, outside Mordor. Denethor’s attempts to burn Faramir alive are the extreme manifestations of the Steward’s suppression of his dutiful son. In contrast to his father, Faramir displays the depth of his nobility by immediately recognizing Aragorn’s long-awaited claim to the throne of Gondor.
