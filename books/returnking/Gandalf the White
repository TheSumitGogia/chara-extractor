Gandalf the White is the great wizard, also known as Mithrandir, who leads the forces of the West. Gandalf, resurrected from his seeming death inThe Fellowship of the Ring,functions as a soldier and a mystic, but more often as an advisor to the political rulers of the world of Men. While Gandalf possesses supernatural abilities, his powers of speech remain his greatest tool for admonishing his counterparts and rebuking his foes.
