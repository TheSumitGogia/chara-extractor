Gollum (Sméagol) is a black and bestial creature who owned the Ring prior to Bilbo. Gollum incessantly pursues Frodo throughoutThe Lord of the Ringsin hopes of regaining the Ring. Throughout the novel, Gollum acts as a strange double to Frodo. The shriveled creature represents what Frodo might become under the Ring’s influence. As Gandalf predicts, Gollum’s evil ultimately serves a good purpose. Gollum completes the Ring-quest, biting the Ring off Frodo’s finger and falling into the Cracks of Doom.
