Saruman the White is the deposed wizard and the enactor of the Shire’s brief police state. Out of pride, Saruman refuses forgiveness at the hands of Gandalf or Galadriel. Saruman’s power is so diminished that the hobbits easily overthrow his regime, after which the wizard’s dejected slave, Wormtongue, kills him.
