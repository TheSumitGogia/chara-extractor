Sauron is the Dark Lord of Mordor and creator of the One Ring. While we never encounter Sauron himself in the novel, the far-reaching effects of the Darkness of Mordor suggest Sauron’s overwhelming presence throughout Middle-earth. Sauron’s Great Eye, which scans the land from his home in the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr, acts as a manifestation of his will. The destruction of the Ring ultimately empties Sauron of his power.
