The Lieutenant of the Dark Tower is a deputy to Sauron who confronts Gandalf and Aragorn at the gates of Mordor. Although the Lieutenant is a living creature, his face is a skull, and fire burns in his eye sockets and nostrils. The Lieutenant taunts and mocks the assembled army of Gondor, but Gandalf rebukes him and sends him fleeing back into Mordor.
