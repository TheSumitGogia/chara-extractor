Théoden is the King of the Mark and the leader of the Riders of Rohan, or Rohirrim. Théoden functions as a foil, or counterpoint, to Denethor. Whereas Denethor neglects the fate of Minas Tirith by committing suicide, Théoden bravely sacrifices his own life on the battlefield for the sake of the West.
