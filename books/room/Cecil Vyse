Cecil Vyse is the dislikable man who becomes Lucy's fiance for a short period of time. Cecil is pretentious and despises all the country people of Lucy's town, finding them unsophisticated and coarse in comparison to the affluent London society he is used to. He sees Lucy not for herself but as an abstract vision that he has hung upon her. He treats people without kindness or respect. Cecil tries to be authoritarian and manly, but is actually awkward and self-conscious.
