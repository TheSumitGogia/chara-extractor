Lucy Honeychurch is a young woman from Surrey who doesn't know what she wants. Her piano skills show that she has potential for great passions and the ability to recognize truth even if it means breaking the social codes that are expected of her. She grows into a woman through the course of the book, choosing to follow the true instincts of love (as represented by George) over the tedious falsities perpetuated by pretentious upper class society (as represented in Cecil).
