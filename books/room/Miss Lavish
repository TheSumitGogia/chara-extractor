Miss Lavish is an ostentatious writer who also stays in the same pension in Florence, and hopes to write novels about Italian life. She is outspoken and clever, but also abrasive. She despises English people traveling abroad and believes she alone knows the "true" Italy; however, her unconventionality falls very close to conventional ideas.
