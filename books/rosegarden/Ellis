Ellis is a Conscientious Objector. When given a choice between prison and working in the mental hospital, he chooses the hospital. He is the replacement for Hobbs, an attendant who commits suicide during the course of the novel. Ellis's fear and hatred of the mental patients is evident in his every gesture. The patients, sensing that Ellis himself has mental problems, torment him by ridiculing his fundamental religious beliefs. McPherson, another attendant, convinces Deborah and the other patients to stop tormenting them. Later, Deborah witnesses Ellis physically abuse Helene, but no one takes her seriously when she reports it.
