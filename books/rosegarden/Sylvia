Sylvia is a patient at the mental hospital. She is normally silent and withdrawn. When Helene attacks Sylvia in a fit of violence, Sylvia makes no outward sign of distress. While the staff rushes to contain Helene, only Deborah understands why Sylvia needs attention as much as Helene. The same thing happened when Helene attacked Deborah. Deborah wants to offer Sylvia comfort, but she can't bring herself to do it.
