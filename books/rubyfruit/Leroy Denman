Leroy Denman is Molly’s cousin. The tubby, slow-witted son of Ep and Jenna, Leroy is Molly’s main childhood playmate. As an adolescent, Leroy thins out and becomes more of a redneck, spending most of his free time at the motorcycle shop. Though he seems unsure of his sexuality in his teens, he marries and has children by his twenties.
