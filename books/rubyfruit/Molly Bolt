Molly Bolt is the sharp-witted lesbian protagonist. Molly is beautiful, athletic, and highly intelligent, and she has a very strong will. She rarely backs down from a dispute, is honest to the point of painfulness, and is driven to succeed beyond society’s expectations. Molly’s determination often gets her into trouble, but she always exudes self-esteem and remains unapologetic for being who she is.
