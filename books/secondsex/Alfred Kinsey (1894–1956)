Alfred Kinsey (1894–1956) is an American zoologist and sex therapist known for his revolutionary work on human sexual behavior,Sexual Behavior in the Human Male. Because this landmark work was published in1948, only a year beforeThe Second Sex, its influence is keenly felt throughout de Beauvoir’s study. Kinsey followed this report five years later withSexual Behavior in the Human Female. Both reports, based on tens of thousands of interviews, came under scrutiny for the witnesses’ unreliable testimonies.
