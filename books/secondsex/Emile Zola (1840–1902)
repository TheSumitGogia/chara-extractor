Emile Zola (1840–1902) is a French novelist, journalist, and founder of the naturalist movement in late nineteenth-century French letters. Zola’s novels, especiallyNana(1880), are known for their stinging depiction of the moral decay of French society. De Beauvoir cites Zola’s realistic depiction of the situation of women.
