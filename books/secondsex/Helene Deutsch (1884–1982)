Helene Deutsch (1884–1982) is an early follower of Freud who became known as one of the first psychoanalysts to introduce theories of female sexuality into public discourse. A pioneer for women in fields of medicine and psychology, Deutsch had a troubled relationship with her parents, which she used as the basis for many of her later theories in her most famous book,The Psychology of Women(1944–1945). She argued that girls’ problems stemmed from the inability to detach from their mothers.
