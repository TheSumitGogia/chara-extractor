Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) is the French existentialist philosopher, playwright, and novelist who dominated three decades of intellectual life in France and was the lifelong companion of de Beauvoir. Sartre’s major works include the philosophical treatiseBeing and Nothingness(1943) and the playsThe Flies(1943) andNo Exit(1944). He rejected the institution of “bourgeois marriage” and took the lead in pursuing “contingent” affairs with other woman, but he remained allied to de Beauvoir until his death. As is evident throughoutThe Second Sex, his ideas influenced hers immensely—sometimes too much, as her detractors often claim.
