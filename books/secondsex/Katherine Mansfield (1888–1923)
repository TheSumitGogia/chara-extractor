Katherine Mansfield (1888–1923) is New Zealand’s most famous writer, who is credited with reinventing the short story in English. Mansfield’s two most celebrated works areBliss(1920) andThe Garden Party(1922). De Beauvoir often cites passages from Mansfield’s fiction to illustrate the frequent swoons and spasms of sudden revelation that seize her respectable, outwardly conventional heroines.
