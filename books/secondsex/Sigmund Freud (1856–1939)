Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) is the father of psychoanalysis and one of the first theorists of the sexual nature of hysteria. Freud’s first major works wereThe Interpretation of Dreams(1899), his first manifesto of psychoanalysis, followed byThe Psychopathology of Everyday Life(1901) andThree Essays on the Theory of Sexuality(1905). In the years leading up to World War I, Freud’s theories attracted many followers, including Carl Jung, Willem Stekel, and Alfred Adler, although many of his original adherents later broke with him. De Beauvoir finds many deficiencies in Freud’s thinking as they relate to the development of women.
