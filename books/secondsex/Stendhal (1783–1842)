Stendhal (1783–1842) is the writer most credited with developing the French novel from romanticism to realism in the nineteenth century. Proof of Stendhal’s realism surfaces in his portrayal of women in classic novels likeThe Red and the Black(1831) andThe Charterhouse of Parma(1839). In “The Myth of Women in Five Authors,” de Beauvoir argues that Stendhal is unique in demonstrating an understanding of women as real flesh-and-blood creatures, doomed by the mediocrity of their circumstances.
