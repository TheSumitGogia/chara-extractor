June Boatwright is Sister of August and May and part owner of the Boatwright farm. June finds it difficult to like Lily at first because she resents August’s involvement in the white world as a housekeeper for Lily’s mother. In her spare time, June volunteers as a cellist for the local hospital, where her music soothes dying patients. She is involved in a love affair with Neil, to whom she refuses to get married. Stubborn and strong-headed, June eventually shows herself to be kind and caring as well.
