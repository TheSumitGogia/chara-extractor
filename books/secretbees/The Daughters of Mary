The Daughters of Mary is a group of African Americans who have created their own religion, based around the Boatwright statue of the black Mary. Although most group members are women, there are some men who attend the Daughters get-togethers and celebrations. Lily and Rosaleen participate in this religion while staying at Augustâ€™s farm.
