Madame Marie Arnoux is the woman Frédéric pursues unsuccessfully for years. Madame Arnoux represents a domestic, maternal figure for Frédéric, satisfying his needs for safety and comfort. Although she finally returns Frédéric’s feelings, she remains virtuous; Frédéric rejects her sole attempt to become his lover. She represents his inability to desire anything that he can actually have; when he gets her, he no longer wants her.
