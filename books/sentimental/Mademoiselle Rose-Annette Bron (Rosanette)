Mademoiselle Rose-Annette Bron (Rosanette) is a courtesan, also called the Marshal because she teases her guests about being their Marshal, or general. Rosanette becomes a significant lover of Frédéric, eventually bearing him a son who dies in infancy. Rosanette is “kept” by various men, including Arnoux, Monsieur Oudry, Delmar, and Frédéric.
