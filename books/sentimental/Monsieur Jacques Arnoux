Monsieur Jacques Arnoux is the husband of Frédéric’s love, Madame Arnoux. Monsieur Arnoux becomes a friend of sorts to Frédéric, introducing him into his social circle and taking him into his confidence. He never seems to see Frédéric’s infatuation with Madame Arnoux, perhaps because he is too involved in his own string of love affairs. Monsieur Arnoux is an art dealer who had once aspired to be an artist. He eventually gives up his art shop to become a factory owner.
