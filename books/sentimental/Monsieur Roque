Monsieur Roque is an acquaintance of Madame Moreau’s. Although Roque lost his reputation from living with his housekeeper, he redeems it slightly when he marries her. He is a steward for Monsieur Dambreuse and loaned a great deal of money to Madame Moreau—only to then demand repayment, which destroyed her financially. His daughter is Louise.
