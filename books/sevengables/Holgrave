A young lodger in Hepzibah’s home, Holgrave earns his living by making an early kind of photograph known as a daguerreotype. Holgrave’s politics are very liberal and revolutionary, but he is kind despite the strange and lawless company he keeps. No one knows that Holgrave is actually a descendant of the first Matthew Maule. This link has given him hypnotic powers, but does not prevent him from falling in love with Phoebe Pyncheon.
