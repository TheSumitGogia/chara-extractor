Bob Starrett is Bob is the narrator of the book and allows us to see Shane and the rest of the characters and events through the eyes of a boy. He is a boy yearning for action and yearning for someone to revere. His father is his hero, but, when he meets Shane, he realizes that Shane is the most extraordinary man he has ever known. Shane redefines for Bob what it means to be a man and a hero, and Shane teaches Bob many lessons, such as that it does not take a man to engage in a fight. He also teaches Bob to accept responsibility for his actions, even if some external force has provoked them. Bob looks at Shane with wonder and awe throughout the book, and it is easy then for the reader to absorb this outlook. Much of Shane's impact, especially on Marian, is lost on Bob because he is too young to understand it.Read anin-depth analysis of Bob Starrett.
