Fletcher is the antagonist of the book. He is a pure villain and a problem from the outset, becoming increasingly more and more threatening as the book progresses. He is angry that Joe will not sell him his farm and angry that Joe has rallied the other farmers against him. When Shane comes to town, Joe becomes an even more formidable adversary to Fletcher, driving Fletcher to greater and greater lengths in order to triumph. Fletcher resorts to violence and murder and stands in direct contrast as a man to both Joe and Shane.
