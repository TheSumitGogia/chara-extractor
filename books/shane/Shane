Shane is the title character and protagonist of the book. A stoic, mysterious man, he says little about himselfâ€”no one even knows his last name. He dresses differently and moves differently, with a kind of confidence and power that is immediately noticeable. He is Bob's hero and quickly becomes Joe Starrett's companion. Shane is loyal to the very end, never compromising any of the Starretts or placing them in danger. He is quick to deal with people and situations that are potentially dangerous, and he feels both tenderness and responsibility for the Starretts. He is both dangerous and the safest man to have around because it is clear that he can handle himself in a fistfight or gunfight, but it is also clear that once tied to someone he will forever be loyal. Shane epitomizes for the novel both what it means to be a man and what it means to be a hero.Read anin-depth analysis of Shane.
