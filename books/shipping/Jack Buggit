Jack Buggit is Editor ofThe Gammy Birdin Killick-Claw, Newfoundland. A fisherman through and through, Jack usually chooses fishing over coming into work. He has an uncanny sense about the sea. Although he has saved many from drownings, he failed to save his son Jesson, who died at sea. Although he is almost never around, he maintains a tight grip on his authority at the newspaper, and feels proud that his paper lacks any resemblance to good journalism.
