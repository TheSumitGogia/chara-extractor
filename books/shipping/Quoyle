Quoyle is a thirty-six year old pathetic newspaper reporter and the protagonist for the novel. Quoyle is a failure at life, and, the narrator tells, a failure of physical appearance. He is extremely large and clumsy, with a most prominent shelf under his chin. Quoyle is lonely and consigned to seeing himself as a failure, and is therefore vulnerable to the hurt of a cruel lover. His submissive kindness does help him make friends and he is a loving father. He is deathly afraid of water and car wrecks. The prodigy of a long line of wild, dimwitted murderers, Quoyle struggles with segregating himself from the pain of his familial and personal past.
