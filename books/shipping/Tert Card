Tert Card is the managing editor for theGammy Bird, who bears great resemblance to the devil himself. Politically, he falls on the opposite end of the spectrum from Billy Pretty, worshipping oil and the age of technology in general. He is cantankerous and crusty. He has a terrible reputation with typographical errors in the paper, and condemns the harsh living conditions of Newfoundland.
