Wavey Prowse is the "tall and quiet" woman in Quoyle's life. She is passionately devoted to her son, and just like Quoyle, she is haunted by the memories of a past, abusive lover. Quoyle first notices her for the dignified way she carries herself, and her habit of walking. She is kind, and also loves Quoyle's kids.
