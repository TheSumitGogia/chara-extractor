Siddhartha’s Father is a respected Brahmin in Siddhartha’s boyhood community. Siddhartha’s father familiarizes Siddhartha with many basic religious teachings, but he is unable to provide Siddhartha with the answers he needs, which leads to Siddhartha’s quest for enlightenment through other religious traditions. When the Samanas arrive to tempt Siddhartha away, Siddhartha’s father initially resists but eventually lets him go.
