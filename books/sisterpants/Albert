Albert is Carmen’s father. Albert failed to tell Carmen he was engaged and that he’d moved to a new house, thinking it’d be best to tell her in person. However, his efforts to spare Carmen pain actually make things worse. He doesn’t know how to communicate effectively with Carmen, preferring instead to just pretend everything is okay.
