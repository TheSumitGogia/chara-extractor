Bridget Vreeland is the athletic, daring friend who spends the summer at soccer camp in Baja California, Mexico. Bridget is impulsive, courageous, and a little reckless, but her extroversion and high spirits help her to make friends easily. She’s an ace soccer player, but she can sometimes be too aggressive, and she is often scolded for not being a team player. Bridget falls in love with a coach named Eric, an experience that leaves her devastated. Bridget’s mother died (probably a suicide) many years ago.
