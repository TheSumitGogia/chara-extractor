Carmen Lowell is the thoughtful friend, whose first-person narratives open and close the novel. Carmen is the most introspective of the four girls, and she recognizes the importance of their friendship more clearly than the other girls do. Half Puerto Rican and half white, Carmen lives with her mother, Christina. Her plans for spending a summer with her father, Albert, in South Carolina are ruined when she discovers that Albert is engaged to a woman with two teenage children, all of them blond.
