Lena Karigalis is the shy, beautiful friend who travels to Oia, Greece, to spend the summer with her grandparents. Lena is introverted and quiet, happiest when she can spend time alone and paint. She distrusts all boys, certain they like her only for her looks, and she automatically writes off Kostos, the Greek boy her grandmother tries to set her up with. Her inability to open up to people leads her to make a confusing mess out of an unexpected encounter she has with Kostos. Fearing sheâ€™ll be alone forever, she eventually forces herself to tell Kostos she likes him.
