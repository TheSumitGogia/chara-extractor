Paul Lazzaro is AnotherPOWand the man responsible for Billy’s death. Lazzaro, a revenge-loving ruffian with criminal tendencies, arranges for Billy’s assassination to avenge Roland Weary’s death. Lazzaro’s determination to kill Billy does not create a conflict between the two characters, however; because Billy has accepted the Tralfamadorians’ conception of nonlinear time, he is unconcerned by his death.
