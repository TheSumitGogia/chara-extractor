The Irish Headmistress is a twenty-six-year-old woman recruited by the Colonial Office in England to run the girl’s school in Antigua. The headmistress often rebuked the girls by telling them to stop behaving “as if they were monkeys just out of the trees.” Her thoughtless racism is emblematic of the callousness of colonial rule and of the passivity of the Antiguans when faced with it.
