The Woman from the Mill Reef Club is a wealthy woman Kincaid speaks to regarding the rebuilding effort for the library. This unnamed woman is well-known for her dislike of the Antiguans in any role except that of a servant. She encourages “her girls” (employees) to use the library and wants to rebuild it just as it was before the earthquake. Kincaid sees her as motivated by nostalgia for the days of colonial rule and resents the woman’s smirking at the corruption of the post-independence government, though she also resents the accuracy of the charge.
