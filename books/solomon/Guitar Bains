Guitar Bains is Milkman’s best friend. Having grown up in poverty after his father was killed in a factory accident, Guitar harbors a lifelong hatred for white people, whom he sees as responsible for all evil in the world. Morrison points out that while Guitar’s rage is justifiable, his murders of white people neither combat racism nor help the African-American community.
