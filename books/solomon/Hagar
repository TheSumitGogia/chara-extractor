Hagar is Pilate’s granddaughter and Milkman’s lover. Hagar devotes herself to Milkman, even though he loses interest and frequently rejects her. Like her biblical namesake—a servant who, after bearing Abraham’s son is thrown out of the house by his barren wife, Sarah—Hagar is used and abandoned. Her plight demonstrates a central theme inSong of Solomon: the inevitable abandonment of women who love men too much.
