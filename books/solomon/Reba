Reba is Pilate’s daughter and Hagar’s mother, also known as Rebecca. Reba has a strong sexual drive but is  attracted to abusive men. Nevertheless, because  Pilate is her mother, the few men who dare mistreat  her are punished. Reba’s uncanny ability to win contests such as the Sears half-millionth customer diamond ring giveaway demonstrates that wealth is transient and unimportant.
