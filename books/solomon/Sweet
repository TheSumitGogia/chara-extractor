Sweet is a prostitute with whom Milkman has a brief affair. Unlike Milkmanâ€™s affairs with other women, especially Hagar, his relationship with Sweet is mutually respectful and entirely reciprocal. His interactions with her demonstrate that the most gratifying relationships in the novel are those in which both partners treat each other as equals.
