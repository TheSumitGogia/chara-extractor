Sophie's teacher, Alberto Knox represents the ideal philosopher. He is never quick to judge and he always thinks about what he is doing. Alberto believes passionately in philosophy, since it helps him understand that his existence is due to the mind of Albert Knag. Alberto is an excellent teacher because he forces Sophie to think things out on her own and does not make things easy for her but he also cares about her and wants her to learn.
