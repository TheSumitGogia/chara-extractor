Hilde MÃ¸ller Knag is Hilde is Albert Knag's daughter and Sophie and Alberto are created for her amusement. Like Sophie, she is a deep thinker, and the philosophy in the book intrigues her deeply. Hilde is also extremely compassionate, and she feels for Sophie and Alberto while her father plays with their lives. She is independent, and proves it by giving her father a taste of his own medicine during his return from Lebanon. Hilde thinks things through but also trusts her instincts over her reason sometimes, and her instinct is what tells her that Sophie actually exists.
