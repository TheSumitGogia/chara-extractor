Joanna is Sophie's best friend and she is loyal and friendly, although she does not think about things in the same way that Sophie does. But Joanna also will not turn away from philosophy in the same way that Sophie's mother does. So Joanna shows some promise. Perhaps if she had a philosophy course she would progress in the same way that Sophie did.
