Sophie's mother is one of the funnier characters in the book because she provides a foil for Sophie's philosophical adventures. Mrs. Amundsen thinks that her daughter is losing her mind when she starts spouting off about the differences between humans and animals and how thinking makes one a human being. Sadly, she also represents those who do not think in the world, a population that, Alberto warns Sophie, includes most of the people.
