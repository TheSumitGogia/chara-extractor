John Gilbert is a young settler from Springfield whom the Indians hold captive. John is ill and suffering when Rowlandson visits him in a settlement near Hadley. Underclothed and left outside, along with an orphaned Indian baby, John moves Rowlandson to pity. His predicament exemplifies the Indiansâ€™ cruelty and the extent to which all captives are reduced to dependence on the kindness of strangers.
