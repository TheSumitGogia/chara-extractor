John Hoar is an English settler who is friendly with the “praying Indians” of Massachusetts. Kind, diplomatic Hoar acts as a messenger and helps to negotiate Rowlandson’s release. He arrives at Wachuset with letters to King Philip from the council in Boston, and when Rowlandson is freed, he travels back to Boston with her. Well-connected in both Indian and British circles, Hoar provides a means for settlers to interact with Indians without losing any of their own civility.
