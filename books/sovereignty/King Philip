King Philip is the unstable, unreliable leader of the Wampanoag Indians. At times, King Philip reassures Rowlandson that she’ll soon be free. But when her redemption is near, he tries to bypass the structure of the council, refusing to meet with the rest of the Indians in their General Court and promising Rowlandson her freedom in exchange for food and goods.
