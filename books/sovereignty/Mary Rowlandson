Mary Rowlandson is the narrator and protagonist. Mary Rowlandson is a wife and mother who finds her life disrupted when Indians take her captive after the attack on Lancaster. Rowlandson finds solace in the Bible during her captivity, and her charity and kindness prompt her to help others when she is able, often by helping them find solace in the Bible as well. As her time with the Indians progresses, however, Rowlandson becomes less sure of her own moral high ground and less certain of the savagery of her captors. She begins to realize the capacity for savagery that lies within all people, even Christians, and this knowledge haunts her even after her return to civilization. But she is grateful to God for her redemption and writes her story as a way of teaching other settlers about Godâ€™s power and grace.
