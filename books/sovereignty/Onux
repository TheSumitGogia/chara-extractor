Onux is the oldest of Quannopin’s three wives. Onux is kind to Rowlandson, unlike Wettimore, another of Quannopin’s wives. When Rowlandson arrives in Wachuset, Quannopin asks Onux to tend to Rowlandson’s needs, and Onux feeds her a meal of beans, meat, and ground-nut cake. As an Indian who is willing to treat a captive decently, Onux demonstrates the kindness and compassion that can exist even among people who are presumed to be savages and who are, in wartime, the enemy.
