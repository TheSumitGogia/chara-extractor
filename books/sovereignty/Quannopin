Quannopin is a Saggamore Indian who is related to King Philip by virtue of being married to Philip’s wife’s sister. Quannopin is Rowlandson’s master when she is among the Indians. Having purchased Rowlandson from the Indian who originally took her captive, Quannopin is generally kind and decent to her. He is not always present to make sure Rowlandson is well-treated, however. For several weeks of Rowlandson’s captivity, Quannopin travels elsewhere among the Indian settlements, leaving Rowlandson in the care of one of his three wives.
