Robert Pepper is a captive colonist who proves helpful to Rowlandson. Pepper meets Rowlandson after he has already been traveling with the Indians for some time. Like Rowlandson, he had a wound to tend to when he was first taken captive. He shares with Rowlandson the folk knowledge he learned from the Indians, teaching her how oak leaves can help to heal her. Pepper, who has learned how to use nature to his advantage, is a positive example of a settler negotiating the world of the wilderness.
