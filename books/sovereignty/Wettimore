Wettimore is One of Quannopin’s three wives. Wettimore is proud and vain, concerned primarily with wealth, status, and her own appearance. She is generally unkind to Rowlandson, and only when Rowlandson’s freedom approaches does she begin treating her better, possibly because she wants some of the ransom money the settlers will offer. Wettimore serves as a foil to Rowlandson: her negative qualities contrast strongly with Rowlandson’s positive characteristics.
