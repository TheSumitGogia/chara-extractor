Count Mippipopolous is a wealthy Greek count and a veteran of seven wars and four revolutions. Count Mippipopolous becomes infatuated with Brett, but, unlike most of Brett’s lovers, he does not subject her to jealous, controlling behavior. Amid the careless, amoral pleasure-seeking crowd that constitutes Jake’s social circle, the count stands out as a stable, sane person. Like Pedro Romero, he serves as a foil for Jake and his friends.
