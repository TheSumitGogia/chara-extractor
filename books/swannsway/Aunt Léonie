Aunt LÃ©onie is Marcel's great aunt. She is convinced that she will die at any moment and tries to get as much sympathy as possible for her various "ailments." Nevertheless, Marcel has fond memories of her and her habit of dipping madeleines in tea. Marcel later dips madeleines himself, helping him recall his lost memories of Combray.
