M. Vinteuil is the composer of Swann and Odette's favorite sonata, which becomes the theme music of Swann's love. This sonata has the power to conjure up Swann's feelings for Odette even when he tries not to think of her. The sorrow and despair that Vinteuil expresses in this sonata about the lesbian love affair of his daughter, Mademoiselle Vinteuil, come to stand for Swann's sufferings as well.
