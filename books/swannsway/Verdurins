Verdurins is the insufferably hypocritical and obnoxious bourgeois couple that first introduces Odette to Swann and then to Forcheville. They enlist a salon of "faithful" members who become their slaves and whom they force to attend various functions. Compared to Swann, the Verdurins have no class, intelligence, culture, or social distinction.
