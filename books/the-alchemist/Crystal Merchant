Crystal Merchant is a struggling merchant who owns a crystal shop on top of a desolate hill.                 His shop was once popular but lost much of its business as Tangier lost its status                 as Egyptâ€™s premiere port town. He is a good-hearted, devout Muslim, but has a                 crippling fear of change.
