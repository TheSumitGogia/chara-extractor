Siobhan is Christopher’s primary teacher at school. An even-handed mentor, she works                 to expand Christopher’s horizons socially as well as academically. As a result, she                 is one of the few people whom Christopher trusts, and in the limited moments when                 the reader sees her, she mirrors the reader as an observer and commentator on                 Christopher’s life.
