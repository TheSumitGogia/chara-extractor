Isaac is the mutual friend of Hazel's and Augustus's who facilitates their introduction at Support Group. Isaac is cynical by nature. Blinded by cancer and kicked to the curb by his girlfriend Monica, Isaac often embodies skepticism and rage. It is worth noting that he shares his name with Biblical Isaac, who also was blind.
