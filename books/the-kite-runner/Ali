Ali is Acting father to Hassan and a servant of Baba’s. Ali is defined by his                 modesty more than anything, and he works diligently as Baba’s servant. He loves                 Hassan deeply, though he rarely expresses his emotions outwardly. Poor and an ethnic                 Hazara, he suffers from partial paralysis of his face and walks with a limp caused                 by polio.
