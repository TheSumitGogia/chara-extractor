Amir is the narrator and the protagonist of the story. Amir is the sensitive and                 intelligent son of a well-to-do businessman in Kabul, and he grows up with a sense                 of entitlement. His best friend is Hassan, and he goes back and forth between acting                 as a loyal friend and attacking Hassan out of jealousy whenever Hassan receives                 Amir’s father’s affection. Amir is a gifted storyteller and grows from aspiring                 writer to published novelist. His great desire to please his father is the primary                 motivation for his behavior early in the novel, and it is the main reason he allows                 Hassan to be raped. From that point forward, he is driven by his feelings of guilt                 as he searches to find a way to redeem himself. Ultimately he does so through                 courage and self-sacrifice, and he tells his story as a form of                 penance.
