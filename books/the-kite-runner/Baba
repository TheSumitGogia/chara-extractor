Baba is Father of Amir and Hassan and a wealthy, well-respected businessman. Baba                 believes first and foremost in doing what is right and thinking for oneself, and he                 tries to impart these qualities to Amir. He also never lets anyoneâ€™s lack of belief                 in him stop him from accomplishing his goals. Although he distrusts religious                 fundamentalism, he follows his own moral code and acts with self-assurance and                 bravery. When necessary, he is even willing to risk his life for what he believes                 in. Yet his shame at having a child with a Hazara woman leads him to hide the fact                 that Hassan is his son. Because he cannot love Hassan openly, he is somewhat distant                 toward Amir and is often hard on him, though he undoubtedly loves                 him.
