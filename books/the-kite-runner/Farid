Farid is Amir’s driver and friend. A former mujahedin fighter, Farid is at first                 gruff and unfriendly. But he becomes a valuable and loyal friend to Amir in Amir’s                 search to find and rescue Sohrab. He is missing toes and fingers from a landmine                 explosion and represents the difficulties that many Afghans faced in the years of                 warfare that ravaged the country.
