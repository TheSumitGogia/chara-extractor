General Taheri is Sorayaâ€™s father and a friend of Baba. General Taheri is proud to the                 point of arrogance at times, and he places great value on upholding Afghan                 traditions. He is in many ways the stereotypical Afghan male, both in his roles as a                 father and husband.
