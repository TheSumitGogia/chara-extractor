Hassan is Amir’s best friend and half-brother as well as a servant of Baba’s.                 Hassan proves himself a loyal friend to Amir repeatedly, defending Amir when he is                 attacked and always being ready to listen. His defining traits are bravery,                 selflessness, and intelligence, though his smarts are more instinctual than bookish,                 largely because he is uneducated. As a poor ethnic Hazara, he is considered an                 inferior in Afghan society, and he is the victim of racism throughout the novel as a                 result. He is Baba’s illegitimate child, though he is not aware of this fact, and he                 grows up with Ali acting as his father. His rape is an early catalyst in the story,                 and even though he is not present in a significant portion of the novel, he plays a                 major role throughout.Read anin-depth analysis of Hassan.
