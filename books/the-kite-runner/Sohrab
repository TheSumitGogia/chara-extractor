Sohrab is Son of Hassan and Farzana. In many ways, Sohrab acts as a substitute for                 Hassan in the novel, and he is a central focus of the plot in the later sections of                 the book. He is also an ethnic Hazara and is great with a slingshot. His character                 arc takes him from being a normal little boy to the traumatized victim of sexual and                 physical abuse, and he goes from speaking very little to not at all.
