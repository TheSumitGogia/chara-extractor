Enoch is a fanatical convert to the Christian church in Umuofia. Enochâ€™s disrespectful act of ripping the mask off anegwugwuduring an annual ceremony to honor the earth deity leads to the climactic clash between the indigenous and colonial justice systems. While Mr. Brown, early on, keeps Enoch in check in the interest  of community harmony, Reverend Smith approves of his zealotry.
