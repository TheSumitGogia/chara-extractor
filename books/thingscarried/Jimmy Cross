Jimmy Cross is the lieutenant of the Alpha Company, who is responsible for the entire group of men. Cross is  well intentioned but unsure of how to lead his men. He is wracked with guilt because he believes that his preoccupation with his unrequited love for a girl named Martha and his tendency to follow orders despite his better judgment caused the deaths of Ted Lavender and Kiowa, two members of Alpha Company.
