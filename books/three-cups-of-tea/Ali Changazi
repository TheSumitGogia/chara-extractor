Ali Changazi is a Pakistani broker who both helps and hinders Mortenson’s mission.                 Changazi is a local “operator” who takes advantage of Mortenson’s naiveté on several                 occasions. Mortenson initially believes Changazi is trustworthy because he has                 organized K2 expeditions. However, Changazi tries to pressure Mortenson into                 building a school in his own village instead of Korphe. Mortenson obtains help from                 the well-connected Changazi to secure the bridge materials, but later learns that                 Changazi has stolen some of the building supplies stored for the Korphe                 school.
