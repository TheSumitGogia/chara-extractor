Haji Ali is village chief of Korphe and one of those who inspired Mortenson’s                 mission. Mortenson stays in Haji’s home on his trips to Korphe, and over time Haji                 explains the customs of his people, helping Mortenson to a better understanding of                 human relationships. Haji shows his commitment to educating the children of his                 village when he pays a bribe of twelve valuable rams to a nearby chief in order to                 ensure construction of the Korphe school.Read anin-depth analysis of Haji Ali.
