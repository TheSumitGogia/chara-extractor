Jahan is Twaha’s daughter and Haji Ali’s granddaughter. She becomes one of the                 Korphe school’s best students and is among the first to receive a CAI scholarship                 for further study. She inspires Kevin Fedarko to write about Mortenson’s work inParadeMagazine when she speaks out during one of Mortenson’s                 speeches, showing a boldness not typical of women in the region. Jahan explains to                 Mortenson that education has given her confidence, and she expands her goals from                 becoming a health care worker to becoming a medical administrator. She wants to                 become a “superlady” who can inspire other women.
