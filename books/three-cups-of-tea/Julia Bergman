Julia Bergman is Jennifer Wilson’s sister and a librarian who selects the books for the                 CAI curriculum. Bergman visits the school in Korphe by chance and sees the name of                 her brother-in-law, Jean Hoerni, on a sign there, then later meets Mortenson and                 joins the board of directors at the CAI. She selects culturally appropriate books                 for the Institute’s schools. After 9/11, she goes to Afghanistan with Mortenson to                 bring supplies for schools.
