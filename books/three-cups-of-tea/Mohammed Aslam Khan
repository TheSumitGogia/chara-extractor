Mohammed Aslam Khan is leader of the Hushe Valley who persuades Mortenson to build a school in                 his village. As a boy, Aslam was sent by his father downriver on a raft to attend                 the nearest school, and after graduation, he was offered a government post. Instead,                 he returned to his village to improve the quality of life there. Aslam recognizes                 that his daughter Shakeela is very gifted and he is eager for her to be educated. He                 is also interested in art and designs the Hushe school, which is adorned with                 colorful decorations.
