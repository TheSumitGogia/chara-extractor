Mouzafer Ali is a Balti man who helps Mortenson survive after his failed climb and later                 becomes a part of his mission. Mouzafer is a highly skilled guide who is modest                 about his accomplishments. He assists Mortenson on his descent, carrying his pack                 and watching him carefully. Mouzafer is later employed by the CAI, and when                 Mortenson learns that Mouzafer’s health is failing, he rushes to build a school for                 Mouzafer’s village.
