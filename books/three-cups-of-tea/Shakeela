Shakeela is Mohammed Aslam Khan’s daughter, who attends the CAI school in Hushe and                 goes on to further study. Her father supports her education, even though most people                 in the area do not approve of schooling for girls. Shakeela’s success brings pride                 to her village and changes its attitude toward educating women.
