Sir Edmund Hillary is the first man to reach the top of Mt. Everest, and an inspiration to                 Mortenson. Hillary made the ascent of Everest in 1953 with his Nepalese guide Tenzin                 Norgay. He later honored the people he met in Nepal during the historic climb by                 funding schools and medical clinics in the remote region. Hillary speaks at an                 American Himalayan Foundation dinner attended by Mortenson, and Mortenson has an                 opportunity to meet the man he has admired since childhood.
