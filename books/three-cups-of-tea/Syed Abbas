Syed Abbas is a conservative Shiite cleric who is instrumental in lifting the fatwa                 against Mortenson. Syed Abbas comes to respect Mortensonâ€™s work, and the two                 collaborate on a project to provide water for a large refugee encampment. Syed                 offers condolences and apologies from the Muslim people in a speech after 9/11.                 Mortenson describes Syed Abbas as an example of the moderate center of                 Islam.
