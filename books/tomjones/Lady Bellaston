Lady Bellaston is a London lady, and a relative of Sophia, whose passionate,  lusty personality leads her to dabble in intrigues. The stem of her last name  "Bella-", meaning "war" in Latin, points to her malicious natureâ€”she  thinks of no one but herself. Lady Bellaston carries out a vengeful battle  against Tom and Sophia with the utmost glee.
