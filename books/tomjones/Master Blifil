Master Blifil is Blifil is antagonist to Tom Jones and the son of Bridget Allworthy and Captain  Blifil. Although he appears at first to be a virtuous character, his hypocrisy  soon exposes itself—Blifil pretends to be pious and principled, but greed  governs him. The fact that Blifil has few redeeming qualities makes Tom  compassion for him at the end of the novel—after the revelation that  Blifil kept the secret of Tom's birth to himself—even more commendable.  Blifil's dearth of natural human appetites—he at first does not desire  Sophia—does not distinguish him as a virtuous character, but rather  provides a depressing picture of what humanity would be like if devoid of  passion.
