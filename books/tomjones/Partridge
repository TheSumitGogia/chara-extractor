Partridge is the teacher whom Allworthy accuses of being Tom's father. He is a  kind of comedic Harlequin character (Fielding even compares him to Harlequin).  Although pathetic, bumbling, and cowardly, Partridge remains a loyal servant to  Jones and deserves his reward at the end of the novel. Partridge has a passion  for speaking in Latin non sequiturs. Although Partridge creates problems for Tom  and Sophia by boosting Tom's reputation and defiling Sophia's to all and sundry,  Tom cannot help forgiving Partridge, who always has the best of intentions.
