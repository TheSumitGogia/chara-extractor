Sophia Western % is Sophia Western is Fielding's beautiful, generous heroine and the daughter of the  violent Squire Western. Like Tom, Sophia lavishes gifts on the poor, and she  treats people of all classes with such respect that one landlady cannot believe  she is a "gentlewoman." Sophia manages to reconcile her love for Tom, her filial  duty to her father, and her hatred for Blifil through her courage and patience.  Sophia's natural courtesy can be contrasted with her Aunt Western's artificial  manners.
