Square is a philosopher who lives with Allworthy. He justifies his questionable  behavior (such as making love to Molly Seagrim) by contorting his philosophical  notions. Square, although a foil to Thwackum, is less sinister than the latter.  Indeed, Square's virtuous transformation at the end of the novel allows  Allworthy to forgive Tom.
