Squire Western % is Squire Western is a caricature of the rough-and-ready, conservative country  gentleman. Affectionate at heart, the Squire nevertheless acts with extreme  violence towards his daughter Sophia, by constantly incarcerating her, and even  verbally and physically abusing her. However, since the Squire is a caricature,  Fielding does not intend for us to judge these actions too harshly. Similarly,  the Squire's insistence on Sophia marrying Blifil has less to do with greed than  with his stubbornness and adherence to tradition. Squire Western's speaks in  West Country dialect, and peppers his speech with curses.
