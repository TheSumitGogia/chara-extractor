Mrs. Torrelli is When Mr. Torrelli is not around, the paisanos have to go through Mrs. Torrelli to get their wine and other goods. Often she barters commodities other than money, despite Mr. Torrelli's efforts to keep her pure. For this weakness and for her plumpness, Mrs. Torrelli is called Butter Duck by the paisanos.
