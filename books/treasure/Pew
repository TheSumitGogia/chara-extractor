Pew is an old, blind beggar and pirate. Pew presents Billy with a black spot, an ultimatum to give up the sea chest’s contents to the pirate gang. Billy dies soon after Pew’s visit, and Pew then dies in a carriage accident. Pew can be seen as an angel of death, foreshadowing the many pirate deaths in the novel.
