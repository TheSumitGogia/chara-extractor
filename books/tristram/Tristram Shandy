Tristram is both the fictionalized author ofThe Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandyand the child whose conception, birth, christening, and circumcision form one major sequence of the narrative. The adult Tristram Shandy relates certain aspects of his family history, including many that took place before his own birth, drawing from stories and hearsay as much as from his own memories. Hisopinionswe get in abundance; of the actual details of his life the author furnishes only traces, and the child Tristram turns out to be a minor character.
