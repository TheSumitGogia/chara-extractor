Margaret Cadaver is Phoebe's next-door neighbor and Sal's father's friend. Margaret helped Sal's father find a job selling farm machinery in order that he could live in Euclid, away from his farm. Although Sal feels deeply suspicious of Margaret's intentions toward her father, Margaret realizes that Sal's father sees her only as a friend and understands that their friendship is based on the fact that Margaret befriended Sal's mother during her last days alive. Margaret herself suffered a great tragedy when she lost her husband in a car accident.
