Shelob is an unimaginably ancient, enormous, and evil female spider that lives in the tunnels near Mordor, ever hungry for prey. Shelob, who is even older than Sauron, serves as a kind of guard for one of the entrances to Mordor. Gollum deceitfully leads Frodo and Sam into Shelobâ€™s lair, where the spider paralyzes Frodo and nearly kills both hobbits before Sam drives her away.
