Jimmy is an old European sailor who settled down on the islands and who speaks the native Polynesian tongue. He often interprets for the Frenchmen. He also enjoys "taboo" status, allowing him to travel through the island with no harm from the natives. Jimmy appears to be an unkind figure, since he basically trades Toby away to a whaling ship with no consideration that Tommo will be trapped.
