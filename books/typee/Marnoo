Marnoo is a native who enjoys "taboo" status and who is able to therefore wander around the island. Marnoo is an elegant person who possesses a dignified stature as well as sexually alluring qualities. Tommo feels attracted to Marnoo just like all the Typees do. Marnoo is described as a Polynesian "Apollo." Marnoo ultimately is also a kind figure because it is he who tells other natives that Tommo is amongst the Typees, which eventually leads to Tommo's rescue.
