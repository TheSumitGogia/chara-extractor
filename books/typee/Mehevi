Mehevi is the most important chief of the Typees. Mehevi's status amongst the Typees is similar to that of a king. Mehevi is a noble and dignified figure whom everyone, including Tommo, treats with respect. Mehevi is also friendly. Tommo spends almost every afternoon sitting and eating with him because he so enjoys Mehevi's company. Mehevi is a classic "noble savage," someone so dignified that they do not need the trappings of civilization to demonstrate the fine person within. His stature speaks for itself.
