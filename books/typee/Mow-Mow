Mow-Mow is a fierce one-eyed chieftain who appears several times, mostly at the very end of the book. Mow-Mow is a threatening figure who primarily serves to contrast with the gentler nobility of Chief Mehevi. The expression of Mow-Mow's ferocity is the final image we receive of the Typees. It is not consistent with the peaceful image that has been developed throughout the book.
