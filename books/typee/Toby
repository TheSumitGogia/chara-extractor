Toby is a young, quiet man who agrees to accompany the narrator on his adventure. We are told that Toby speaks rarely, but that he smiles and never speaks of his past. During their adventure, Toby serves primarily to complement the narrator's character. Their opinions and perspectives frequently are contrary to one another. For example, while Toby believes that they are heading into the Happar valley, Tommo thinks it likely belongs to the Typees. When Tommo feels happy in the valley, Toby remains distrustful of the people around him. Toby's character is not as fully developed as Tommo's, but he does remain a loyal friend who is inadvertently separated from Tommo in the end.
