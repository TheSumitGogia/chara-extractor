Ultima’s teacher was also known as el hombre volador, or “the flying man.” He gave her the owl that became her spirit familiar, her guardian. He told her to do good works with her powers but to avoid interfering with a person’s destiny. The invocation of his name inspires awe and respect among the people who have heard about his legendary powers.
