Franz is a Geneva professor and idealist. Sabina's lover. Franz falls in love with Sabina, whom he (erroneously) considers a liberal and romantically tragic Czech dissident. Sabina considers both of those identities kitsch. He is tortured by the fact that he must betray his wife in order to see Sabina. Ultimately he leaves his wife in what to him is an act of courage, but to Sabina seems an unhappy and sentimental choice. Franz identifies strongly with the European liberal left, loves parades and marches, and idol izes his dead mother. Abandoned by Sabina, he finds solace in the arms of a perfectly ordinary young student who loves him.Read anin-depth analysis of Franz.
