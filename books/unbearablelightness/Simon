Simon is Tomas's son by his first wife. Simon is a dreamer and always idealized his father, who did not wish to know him. After the Prague Spring, a time of increased political and artistic freedom, Simon joins a dissident group and regains contact with Tomas in a failed attempt to win approval. Simon later turns to Christianity, and organizes the funeral of Tomas and Tereza after their deaths.
