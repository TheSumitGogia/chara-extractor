Apollon is the Underground Manâ€™s elderly servant. Apollon lives with the Underground Man and performs household tasks for him somewhat grudgingly. The Underground Man thinks that Apollon is constantly judging him, and that he is unforgivably vain. The Underground Man hates the way Apollon looks and talks.
