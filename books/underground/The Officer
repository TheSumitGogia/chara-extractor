The Officer is a military officer who treats the Underground Man dismissively in a tavern one night, thereby making himself the object of the Underground Manâ€™s obsessive desire for revenge for several years. The Underground Man resents the officer for his rank, wealth, physical prowess, and confidence, but is also intimidated by him for these same reasons, and therefore can never make a move against him.
