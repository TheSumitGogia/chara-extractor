Ab Snopes is a shiftless, lower-class farmer who represents the ugly future of the white South. In other Faulkner novels the Snopes family represents a class of degraded poor whites who eventually rise in power and overwhelm old aristocrats like the Sartorises. Ab Snopes is no exception: he is lazy, greedy and cowardly and betrays Granny Millard twice, first to the Yankees and then to the bandit Grumby. Though he comes across as good-natured at first, he is the novel's most unappealing character, and the fact that he escapes without punishment represents a breach in the moral order.
