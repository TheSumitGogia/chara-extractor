Bayard Sartoris is the novel's narrator and protagonist. The novel traces his coming of age from the time he is twelve until he is a grown man and the head of his family. Bayard is decent, honorable, courageous and intelligent, a model Southern aristocrat for the post-war era. As a boy, he is occasionally given to impetuousness and rashness. In the course of the novel he matures profoundly, gaining a sense of the tragedy of life and learning to balance the often-violent chivalry of the traditional Southern gentleman with sensitivity and mercy.
