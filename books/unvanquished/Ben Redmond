Ben Redmond is Colonel Sartoris's business partner-turned-enemy, who murders him and is in turn driven out of Jefferson by Bayard. Redmond is not successful as the Sartorises are, but the other characters stress that he is not a coward. His confrontation with Bayard is honorable to both sides, although he is defeated.
