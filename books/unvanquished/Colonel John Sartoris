Colonel John Sartoris is Bayard's proud and glorious father, the patriarch of the Sartoris family. Colonel Sartoris commands his own regiment on the Virginia front until he is demoted by his troops so he can return home to care for his family; even then, he raises an "irregular" brigade who terrorize the far more numerous Yankees in Mississippi with their dashing assaults. He is a larger-than-life figure, hot- blooded and arrogant but unceasingly heroic, and Bayard worships him. When he dies at the end of the novel, his son begins to assume his grandeur and valor.
