Colonel Nathaniel Dick is a Union colonel who spares Bayard and Ringo when they shoot a Yankee horse and who issues an order granting Granny more than a hundred mules and slaves. Bayard and the others believe that Yankees are practically a different species, but Colonel Dick represents the humane face of the Northern armyâ€”he is humorous and reasonable, and sympathetic to Granny's plight thanks to thoughts of his own children.
