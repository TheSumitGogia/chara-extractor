Drusilla is Bayard's older cousin, who abandons home to join the Confederate army after her fianc√© is killed. She is fierce, violent, militaristic and stubbornly independent, but displays a moving vulnerability when her mother tries to confine her and force her to be feminine. Eventually, she is pressured into marrying Colonel Sartoris after living with him on the front as a common soldier. Drusilla is the book's most tragic figure, confined by a narrow Southern womanhood that almost breaks her spirit. The book seems to hint that she is in love with Bayard, though she only expresses her passion in a few intense moments.Read anin-depth analysis of Drusilla.
