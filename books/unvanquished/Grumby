Grumby is a cowardly ex-Confederate soldier whose band of mauraders terrorizes the countryside in the wake of the Yankee occupation. Grumby is the opposite of Colonel Sartoris: he preys on the local population rather than protecting them, and kills a defenseless old woman rather than fighting against the Yankees. By killing him, Bayard achieves more than personal revengeâ€”he sets right the moral order for the entire community.
