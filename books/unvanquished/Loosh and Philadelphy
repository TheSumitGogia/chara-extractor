Loosh and Philadelphy is a traitorous slave of the Sartoris family and his helpless wife. Although Loosh's fury at white Southerners seems understandable to the reader, he is portrayed as cruel and deceitful, leading the Yankees to the plantation and stealing Granny's silver. Philadelphy does not share his vengefulness and feels sad and guilty, but she is unable to sway him from his course.
