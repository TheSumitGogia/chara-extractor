Louvinia is a practical, devoted slave of the Sartoris family. Louvinia is the equivalent of the family mammy, and like the stereotypical mammy she is ornery but ultimately loyal and affectionate. She has no desire to be free, and angrily criticizes Loosh for turning on the Sartorises, calling him an ingrate and a fool.
