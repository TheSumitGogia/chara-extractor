Ringo is a black slave born the same month as Bayard, who is his best friend and constant companion. Ringo (short for Marengo) is the smarter of the two boys, and displays savvy and entrepreneurism as well as a sense of humor that Bayard lacks. He is bold and courageous, and accompanies Bayard on his most dangerous and difficult adventures. Even after the slaves are freed, he continues to serve Bayard with the same unfailing devotion as before.
