Rosa Millard is Bayard's grandmother, Granny Millard a stubborn old woman who becomes the novel's most authentic hero. At first Granny seems difficult to like: she is cold and severe, quick to punish others, insistent on having her own way and rigidly moral, even though her morality does not prevent her from lying and cheating when she has to. In fact, she sets up an audacious mule-stealing scam against the Yankees that lasts for almost a year, which relies on her fragile, elderly appearance and her brilliant cunning. But despite these apparent flaws, Faulkner clearly feels a genuine affection for her, and ultimately portrays her as a tireless crusader for her family and for the poor people of the county, every bit as chivalrous as Bayard or Colonel Sartoris. Her death at the hands of a cowardly bandit is the novel's turning point and its emotional climax.
