Uncle Buck is a brave but undeniably eccentric old man who lives with his brother Uncle Buddy on the outskirts of town. Buck and Buddy (whose real names are Amodeus and Theophilus) are true town characters, who live in a converted slave cabin while their slaves live in the main house. They give their slaves considerable freedom and are beloved by the poor hill people for their generosity and leadershipâ€”the polar opposite of the Snopeses. Buck, forced to stay home in Jefferson while his brother is away at the war, accompanies Bayard on his quest for revenge against Grumby.
