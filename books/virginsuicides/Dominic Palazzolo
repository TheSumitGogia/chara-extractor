Dominic Palazzolo is an overly suave Italian boy of romantic temperament. Dominic lives with his relatives in the neighborhood. He hespeaks little English but is desperately in love with local rich girl Diana Porter. To prove his love, and his despair at her leaving for vacation, he jumps from the roof of his relatives' house, emerging unharmed and satisfied. Shortly thereafter, his family calls him to New Mexico. Neighborhood speculation suggests, probably wrongly, that his jump inspired Cecilia's own.
