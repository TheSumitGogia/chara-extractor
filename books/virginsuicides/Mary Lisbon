Mary Lisbon is the second oldest of the Lisbon girls. Mary Lisbon, age sixteen, is prim, proper, poised, and spends hours in front of the mirror. Her hair is the darkest of the sisters, and she has a slight mustache and a widow's peak. As the house decays, she attempts to maintain her appearance, and wears bright sweaters to collect the mail. After her unsuccessful suicide attempt on the night of June fifteen, Mary spends a month sleeping and obsessively showering while the community faithfully awaits her death. She dies in July by taking sleeping pills.
