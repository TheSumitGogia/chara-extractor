Miss Kilsen is a social worker. Miss Kilsen was hired by the high school after Cecilia's death and she is thought to be the only person in whom the Lisbon girls confided. However, there is no way of knowing for sure, as Miss Kilsen disappeared after her credentials were discovered to be false, and the patient records she had kept were later destroyed in a freak fire.
