Mr. Lisbon is the father of the Lisbon family. A thin, effeminate, retiring man with a high, boyish voice, Mr. Lisbon teaches math at the local high school, for which his daughters receive free tuition. He has been a teacher for as long as anyone can remember, and he seems to enjoy his job and to throw himself into his work. Although he loves his daughters, he finds them to be complete strangers. Despite his accommodating nature, he often feels lost amid the flurry of femininity at home, humiliated by being sent on endless trips to the drugstore for Tampax. Mr. Lisbon is completely cowed by his domineering wife, deferring to her decisions almost automatically. He is unable to even try to challenge her opinion or change her mind. As the novel's tragedy unfolds, Mr. Lisbon withdraws further into his private worldâ€”he eats lunch in his classroom alone at school, he watches baseball obsessively, and after Homecoming he seems unaware of his wife's decision to keep the girls at home, as his tenuous hold on reality begins to slip.
