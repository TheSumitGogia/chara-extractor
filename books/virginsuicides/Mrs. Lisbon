Mrs. Lisbon is the mother of the Lisbon family. Mrs. Lisbon, a vehement, forceful matriarch, is the de facto head of the Lisbon household. Heavy and commandeering, with steel- wool hair and glasses, she bears little resemblance to her five lovely daughters, leaving the boys to wonder how she could have produced them. She rules the house with an iron fist, strictly supervising the girls' comings and goings, television watching, and church attendance. She is insistently Catholic, and many of her rules for the girls—no makeup, no even slightly revealing clothes, and ultimately no rock music—reflect her brand of piety. Mrs. Lisbon reacts strongly to cracks in her totalitarian regime, responding to Lux's breaking curfew on Homecoming by withdrawing the girls from school entirely and locking them in the house "to recover." She is permanently suspicious of the outside world, with a firm belief that girls are best and happiest at home under a mother's watchful eye. Despite her forcefully maternal rhetoric, however, Mrs. Lisbon seems progressively uninterested or unable to attend to the physical welfare of her daughters, taking to her bed for weeks after Cecilia's death. Her housekeeping, fully average as the novel begins, rapidly disintegrates after the first suicide, as the house becomes a jungle of open cans, half-eaten food, mail-order catalogs, and dust.
