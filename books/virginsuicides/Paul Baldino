Paul Baldino is One of the high school boys. Even at fourteen, Paul Baldino's gut, tall tales, gold rings, sleek black shoes, and intimidating presence leave no doubt that he is the son of Sammy "The Shark" Baldino, a suspected local gangster. While the boys rarely believe Paul's elaborate tales, he commands their uniform fear and respect. It is Paul who, exploring storm sewers, comes up into the Lisbon house and discovers Cecilia in the bathtub bleeding from her wrists.
