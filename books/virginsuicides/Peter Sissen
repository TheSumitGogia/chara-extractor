Peter Sissen is the first boy to set foot inside the Lisbon house. Peter Sissen is invited to dinner for helping Mr. Lisbon install a model of the solar system in his high- school math classroom. For months thereafter, Peter regales the boys with his eyewitness account of the Lisbon house and its feminine secrets. His search of the bathroom reveals that at least one girl has begun her period, and he is able to steal Lux's bra from its provocative perch on a crucifix.
