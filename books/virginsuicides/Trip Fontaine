Trip Fontaine is the high school stud. Trip emerges from an unspectacular childhood to become the handsomest boy in high school. Fully aware of his masculine power, Trip takes great care of his appearance, entrance, clothing, and hair. He swaggers down the hall and suns himself daily in the family pool. Trip cares little for school, and instead takes regular trips to his car to smoke marijuana and run a minor drug business on the side. Female admirers, who swoon at his every move and climb willingly into his bed, continually surround him. His recurrent erotic success is assured by his intuitive, gentlemanly discretion, which never allows him to reveal the details of his conquests. When Trip meets Lux and falls overwhelmingly in love, Trip has no idea how to pursue her, having always been the one pursued. Though he interacts with the neighborhood boys, Trip is not one of them, and is not part of the novel's narrative voice.Read anin-depth analysis of Trip Fontaine.
