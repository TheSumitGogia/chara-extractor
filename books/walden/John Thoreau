John Thoreau is Elder brother to Henry David Thoreau. The two brothers oversaw and taught at the Concord Academy, a progressive independent school, from 1838 to 1841. John Thoreauâ€™s failing health was a contributing factor in the demise of the school, and he died in 1842 from complications related to lockjaw.
