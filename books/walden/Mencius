Mencius is a Chinese sage of the fourth centuryB.C.and a disciple of Confucius. Mencius was best known for his anthology of sayings and stories collected under the titleThe Book of Mencius,and did much to promote the reputation of Confucius, although he himself was not widely venerated until more than a thousand years later. Like his master’s work, Mencius’s combination of respect for social harmony and the inward reconciliation with the universe exerted a powerful influence on Thoreau.
