Countess Natalya Rostova is Count Rostov’s wife. The countess is as neglectful of money matters as her husband, maintaining standards of luxury that prove a burden to her son Nicholas when he supports her after the count’s death. The death of her youngest son, Petya, deeply affects the countess, sinking her into a gloom from which she never again emerges.
