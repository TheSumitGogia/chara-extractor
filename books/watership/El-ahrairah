El-ahrairah is the folk hero of rabbits. El-ahrairah is the ultimate trickster, the prince of the rabbits who tries to trick even Lord Frith himself, the sun god and creator. El-ahrairah's adventures, often with the aid of his friend Rabscuttle, are a part of rabbit lore, and Dandelion tells many of his stories.
