Dr. Crane is the headmaster at the private boarding school the boys attend. Dr. Crane represents both traditional authority and religion, and the boysâ€™ individual responses to him are telling. Neville despises him as a repressive, pompous, insincere figure, while Louis admires him as the representative of the English society he so much wants to be a part of. Bernard sees the headmaster primarily as a character about whom he can spin a story.
