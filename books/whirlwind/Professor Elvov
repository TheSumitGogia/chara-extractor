Professor Elvov is a friend and colleague of Ginzburg and a member of the party’s municipal committee. Before the start of Ginzburg’s memoir, Elvov writes a chapter of a book on the history of the Bolsheviks that Stalin later denounces as containing “Trotskyist ideas.” After Kirov’s death, Elvov is arrested on suspicion of being a Trotskyist. Ginzburg’s association with Elvov results in her arrest and trial.
