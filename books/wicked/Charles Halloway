Charles Halloway finds himself throughout the course of the novel. He has to protect Will and Jim, and in the process he is transformed. Mr. Halloway starts out as an old man who vividly remembers his times as a youth but is sure that his days of action are over. But he slowly learns that there is more action in him then he thought, and it also becomes apparent that he is a man with cool nerves and much inner strength. He is the only one who truly sees the carnival for the mockery that it is, and this allows him to laugh at it. He destroys the carnival by laughing at it, and he laughs with such certainty because he is completely comfortable with who he is.
