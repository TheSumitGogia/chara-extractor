Dust Witch is Though the Witch is blind, she feels and hears things that no one else feels or hears. She is the lookout for Mr. Dark and the carnival. The Witch is evil and greedy, and Will uses those traits against her when he destroys her balloon. She is also fearsome, but only if her powers are believed in, and Charles Halloway destroys her with a laugh.
