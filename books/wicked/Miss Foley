A woman who is not happy with her life, Miss Foley thinks that she can find happiness on the merry-go-round. She is obsessed with the idea of the carousel and tries to get Will and Jim into trouble so that they will not stop her from using it, even though the boys saved her from the Mirror Maze. The carousel does not save her but rather takes everything from her and turns her into the broken little girl that the boys come across.
