Brave Orchid is Kingston's mother, whose "talk-stories" about Chinese life and traditions haunt Kingston like ghosts from another world. Brave Orchid is a proud and intelligent woman who comes off as both gentle and cruel in equal parts in the memoir. She appears throughout the book but figures most prominently in "Shaman," which depicts her life in China as a doctor and a woman of almost magical powers. Along with her sister, Moon Orchid, Brave Orchid is a main focus of "At the Western Palace."Read anin-depth analysis of Brave Orchid.
