Fa Mu Lan is a heroic female warrior from a traditional Chinese legend, whom Brave Orchid originally described to Kingston in a talk-story. Fa Mu Lan represents both the Chinese female ideal—as a loving mother and wife—and a source of great power and independence. Kingston feels a kinship with the woman warrior and, in "White Tigers," re-imagines her story in the first person, as if she were the warrior herself. Kingston also contrasts Fa Mu Lan's great accomplishments and victories with the disappointments of her own life.
