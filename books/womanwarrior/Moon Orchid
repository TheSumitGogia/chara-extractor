Moon Orchid is Brave Orchid's sister, who comes to America in her 1960s. Moon Orchid emigrates—at Brave Orchid's encouragement—in an attempt to find her estranged husband, who left China thirty years earlier. Whereas Brave Orchid is forceful and capable and determined, Moon Orchid is timid and incapable of completing even the easiest tasks. She is largely unable to adjust to life in America.
