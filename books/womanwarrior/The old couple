The old couple is an elderly couple who, in "White Tigers," train Fa Mu Lan in martial arts and survival skills on top of the mountain. The old couple are quasi-deities—Fa Mu Lan sees that they are hundreds of years old—and, significantly, are more like parents to the woman warrior than her own parents are.
