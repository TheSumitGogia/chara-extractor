Ts'ai Yen is a Chinese poetess born in 175 A.D., the source of the title of the final chapter. Ts'ai Yen was captured by barbarians and forced to fight their battles, and brought back to her people, the Han, a song called "Eighteen Stanzas for a Barbarian Reed Pipe." She serves a metaphor for both Kingston's own project in writing her memoir—bringing her songs to her people back from "savage lands"—and for the act of talk-story in general.
