Earl McGrath is a friend of the Dunnes’. When Quintana collapses at LAX, Didion calls Earl to see if she can use his house, and he offers her a spot on the private plane he’s taking to L.A. the next day. While in L.A., he calls her daily, and when she doesn’t have plans for the evening he takes her out for quiet dinners with friends.
