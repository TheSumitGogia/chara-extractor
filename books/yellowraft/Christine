Christine is Clara and Lecon’s daughter. Christine is raised as Ida’s daughter, although she is actually Ida’s half-sister and cousin.

After her disillusionment with religion, Christine devotes her time to being popular and chasing boys. Christine is very protective of her brother, Lee, and always concerned for his welfare.
