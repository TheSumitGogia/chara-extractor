Father Hurlburt is a priest on the mission who first becomes acquainted with Ida’s family after the affair between Clara and Lecon. Father Hurlburt has a unique connection with Ida because, after the death of her parents, he is the only person on the reservation who knows the truth of Christine’s lineage. Ida and Father Hurlburt share a special, though often unarticulated, friendship. He is one of the few people who seems to understand Ida, and he is always there when she needs him.
