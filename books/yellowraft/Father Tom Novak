Father Tom Novak is a new cleric at the Holy Martyrs Mission who recruits Rayona into the God Squad. Father Tom is the only person on the reservation who seems to think Rayona is worth his time. The two spend a lot of time together, if only because Rayona has no one else to whom she can relate. However, their close friendship ends awkwardly when Father Tomâ€™s friendship turns to lechery at Bearpaw Lake.
