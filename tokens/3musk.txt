In
which
it
is
proved
that
,
notwithstanding
their
names
'
ending
in
OS
*NL*
and
IS
,
the
heroes
of
the
story
which
we
are
about
to
have
the
honor
to
*NL*
relate
to
our
readers
have
nothing
mythological
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
time
ago
,
while
making
researches
in
the
Royal
Library
for
my
*NL*
History
of
Louis
XIV
,
I
stumbled
by
chance
upon
the
Memoirs
of
M.
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
printed
--
as
were
most
of
the
works
of
that
period
,
in
which
*NL*
authors
could
not
tell
the
truth
without
the
risk
of
a
residence
,
more
*NL*
or
less
long
,
in
the
Bastille
--
at
Amsterdam
,
by
Pierre
Rouge
.
The
title
*NL*
attracted
me
;
I
took
them
home
with
me
,
with
the
permission
of
the
*NL*
guardian
,
and
devoured
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
my
intention
here
to
enter
into
an
analysis
of
this
curious
*NL*
work
;
and
I
shall
satisfy
myself
with
referring
such
of
my
readers
as
*NL*
appreciate
the
pictures
of
the
period
to
its
pages
.
They
will
therein
*NL*
find
portraits
penciled
by
the
hand
of
a
master
;
and
although
these
*NL*
squibs
may
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
traced
upon
the
doors
of
barracks
and
*NL*
the
walls
of
cabarets
,
they
will
not
find
the
likenesses
of
Louis
XIII
,
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
,
Richelieu
,
Mazarin
,
and
the
courtiers
of
the
period
,
*NL*
less
faithful
than
in
the
history
of
M.
Anquetil
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
it
is
well
known
,
what
strikes
the
capricious
mind
of
the
poet
is
*NL*
not
always
what
affects
the
mass
of
readers
.
Now
,
while
admiring
,
as
*NL*
others
doubtless
will
admire
,
the
details
we
have
to
relate
,
our
main
*NL*
preoccupation
concerned
a
matter
to
which
no
one
before
ourselves
had
*NL*
given
a
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
relates
that
on
his
first
visit
to
M.
de
Treville
,
captain
of
*NL*
the
king
's
Musketeers
,
he
met
in
the
antechamber
three
young
men
,
*NL*
serving
in
the
illustrious
corps
into
which
he
was
soliciting
the
honor
*NL*
of
being
received
,
bearing
the
names
of
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
confess
these
three
strange
names
struck
us
;
and
it
immediately
*NL*
occurred
to
us
that
they
were
but
pseudonyms
,
under
which
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
disguised
names
perhaps
illustrious
,
or
else
that
the
bearers
of
these
*NL*
borrowed
names
had
themselves
chosen
them
on
the
day
in
which
,
from
*NL*
caprice
,
discontent
,
or
want
of
fortune
,
they
had
donned
the
simple
*NL*
Musketeer
's
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
we
had
no
rest
till
we
could
find
some
trace
in
*NL*
contemporary
works
of
these
extraordinary
names
which
had
so
strongly
*NL*
awakened
our
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
catalogue
alone
of
the
books
we
read
with
this
object
would
fill
a
*NL*
whole
chapter
,
which
,
although
it
might
be
very
instructive
,
would
*NL*
certainly
afford
our
readers
but
little
amusement
.
It
will
suffice
,
*NL*
then
,
to
tell
them
that
at
the
moment
at
which
,
discouraged
by
so
many
*NL*
fruitless
investigations
,
we
were
about
to
abandon
our
search
,
we
at
*NL*
length
found
,
guided
by
the
counsels
of
our
illustrious
friend
Paulin
*NL*
Paris
,
a
manuscript
in
folio
,
endorsed
4772
or
4773
,
we
do
not
recollect
*NL*
which
,
having
for
title
,
``
Memoirs
of
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
,
Touching
Some
*NL*
Events
Which
Passed
in
France
Toward
the
End
of
the
Reign
of
King
Louis
*NL*
XIII
and
the
Commencement
of
the
Reign
of
King
Louis
XIV
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
easily
imagined
how
great
was
our
joy
when
,
in
turning
over
*NL*
this
manuscript
,
our
last
hope
,
we
found
at
the
twentieth
page
the
name
*NL*
of
Athos
,
at
the
twenty-seventh
the
name
of
Porthos
,
and
at
the
*NL*
thirty-first
the
name
of
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discovery
of
a
completely
unknown
manuscript
at
a
period
in
which
*NL*
historical
science
is
carried
to
such
a
high
degree
appeared
almost
*NL*
miraculous
.
We
hastened
,
therefore
,
to
obtain
permission
to
print
it
,
*NL*
with
the
view
of
presenting
ourselves
someday
with
the
pack
of
others
at
*NL*
the
doors
of
the
Academie
des
Inscriptions
et
Belles
Lettres
,
if
we
*NL*
should
not
succeed
--
a
very
probable
thing
,
by
the
by
--
in
gaining
*NL*
admission
to
the
Academie
Francaise
with
our
own
proper
pack
.
This
*NL*
permission
,
we
feel
bound
to
say
,
was
graciously
granted
;
which
compels
*NL*
us
here
to
give
a
public
contradiction
to
the
slanderers
who
pretend
*NL*
that
we
live
under
a
government
but
moderately
indulgent
to
men
of
*NL*
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
is
the
first
part
of
this
precious
manuscript
which
we
offer
*NL*
to
our
readers
,
restoring
it
to
the
title
which
belongs
to
it
,
and
*NL*
entering
into
an
engagement
that
if
-LRB-
of
which
we
have
no
doubt
-RRB-
this
*NL*
first
part
should
obtain
the
success
it
merits
,
we
will
publish
the
*NL*
second
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
as
the
godfather
is
a
second
father
,
we
beg
the
reader
*NL*
to
lay
to
our
account
,
and
not
to
that
of
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
,
the
*NL*
pleasure
or
the
ENNUI
he
may
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
understood
,
let
us
proceed
with
our
history
.

1
THE
THREE
PRESENTS
OF
D'ARTAGNAN
THE
ELDER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
Monday
of
the
month
of
April
,
1625
,
the
market
town
of
*NL*
Meung
,
in
which
the
author
of
ROMANCE
OF
THE
ROSE
was
born
,
appeared
to
*NL*
be
in
as
perfect
a
state
of
revolution
as
if
the
Huguenots
had
just
made
*NL*
a
second
La
Rochelle
of
it
.
Many
citizens
,
seeing
the
women
flying
*NL*
toward
the
High
Street
,
leaving
their
children
crying
at
the
open
doors
,
*NL*
hastened
to
don
the
cuirass
,
and
supporting
their
somewhat
uncertain
*NL*
courage
with
a
musket
or
a
partisan
,
directed
their
steps
toward
the
*NL*
hostelry
of
the
Jolly
Miller
,
before
which
was
gathered
,
increasing
*NL*
every
minute
,
a
compact
group
,
vociferous
and
full
of
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
those
times
panics
were
common
,
and
few
days
passed
without
some
city
*NL*
or
other
registering
in
its
archives
an
event
of
this
kind
.
There
were
*NL*
nobles
,
who
made
war
against
each
other
;
there
was
the
king
,
who
made
*NL*
war
against
the
cardinal
;
there
was
Spain
,
which
made
war
against
the
*NL*
king
.
Then
,
in
addition
to
these
concealed
or
public
,
secret
or
open
*NL*
wars
,
there
were
robbers
,
mendicants
,
Huguenots
,
wolves
,
and
scoundrels
,
*NL*
who
made
war
upon
everybody
.
The
citizens
always
took
up
arms
readily
*NL*
against
thieves
,
wolves
or
scoundrels
,
often
against
nobles
or
*NL*
Huguenots
,
sometimes
against
the
king
,
but
never
against
the
cardinal
or
*NL*
Spain
.
It
resulted
,
then
,
from
this
habit
that
on
the
said
first
Monday
*NL*
of
April
,
1625
,
the
citizens
,
on
hearing
the
clamor
,
and
seeing
neither
*NL*
the
red-and-yellow
standard
nor
the
livery
of
the
Duc
de
Richelieu
,
*NL*
rushed
toward
the
hostel
of
the
Jolly
Miller
.
When
arrived
there
,
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
hubbub
was
apparent
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
--
we
can
sketch
his
portrait
at
a
dash
.
Imagine
to
yourself
a
*NL*
Don
Quixote
of
eighteen
;
a
Don
Quixote
without
his
corselet
,
without
his
*NL*
coat
of
mail
,
without
his
cuisses
;
a
Don
Quixote
clothed
in
a
woolen
*NL*
doublet
,
the
blue
color
of
which
had
faded
into
a
nameless
shade
between
*NL*
lees
of
wine
and
a
heavenly
azure
;
face
long
and
brown
;
high
cheek
*NL*
bones
,
a
sign
of
sagacity
;
the
maxillary
muscles
enormously
developed
,
*NL*
an
infallible
sign
by
which
a
Gascon
may
always
be
detected
,
even
*NL*
without
his
cap
--
and
our
young
man
wore
a
cap
set
off
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
feather
;
the
eye
open
and
intelligent
;
the
nose
hooked
,
but
finely
*NL*
chiseled
.
Too
big
for
a
youth
,
too
small
for
a
grown
man
,
an
experienced
*NL*
eye
might
have
taken
him
for
a
farmer
's
son
upon
a
journey
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
the
long
sword
which
,
dangling
from
a
leather
baldric
,
hit
*NL*
against
the
calves
of
its
owner
as
he
walked
,
and
against
the
rough
side
*NL*
of
his
steed
when
he
was
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
our
young
man
had
a
steed
which
was
the
observed
of
all
observers
.
*NL*
It
was
a
Bearn
pony
,
from
twelve
to
fourteen
years
old
,
yellow
in
his
*NL*
hide
,
without
a
hair
in
his
tail
,
but
not
without
windgalls
on
his
legs
,
*NL*
which
,
though
going
with
his
head
lower
than
his
knees
,
rendering
a
*NL*
martingale
quite
unnecessary
,
contrived
nevertheless
to
perform
his
*NL*
eight
leagues
a
day
.
Unfortunately
,
the
qualities
of
this
horse
were
so
*NL*
well
concealed
under
his
strange-colored
hide
and
his
unaccountable
*NL*
gait
,
that
at
a
time
when
everybody
was
a
connoisseur
in
horseflesh
,
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
aforesaid
pony
at
Meung
--
which
place
he
had
entered
*NL*
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
by
the
gate
of
Beaugency
--
produced
an
*NL*
unfavorable
feeling
,
which
extended
to
his
rider
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
feeling
had
been
more
painfully
perceived
by
young
*NL*
d'Artagnan
--
for
so
was
the
Don
Quixote
of
this
second
Rosinante
*NL*
named
--
from
his
not
being
able
to
conceal
from
himself
the
ridiculous
*NL*
appearance
that
such
a
steed
gave
him
,
good
horseman
as
he
was
.
He
had
*NL*
sighed
deeply
,
therefore
,
when
accepting
the
gift
of
the
pony
from
M.
*NL*
d'Artagnan
the
elder
.
He
was
not
ignorant
that
such
a
beast
was
worth
at
*NL*
least
twenty
livres
;
and
the
words
which
had
accompanied
the
present
*NL*
were
above
all
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
,
''
said
the
old
Gascon
gentleman
,
in
that
pure
Bearn
PATOIS
of
*NL*
which
Henry
IV
could
never
rid
himself
,
``
this
horse
was
born
in
the
*NL*
house
of
your
father
about
thirteen
years
ago
,
and
has
remained
in
it
*NL*
ever
since
,
which
ought
to
make
you
love
it
.
Never
sell
it
;
allow
it
to
*NL*
die
tranquilly
and
honorably
of
old
age
,
and
if
you
make
a
campaign
with
*NL*
it
,
take
as
much
care
of
it
as
you
would
of
an
old
servant
.
At
court
,
*NL*
provided
you
have
ever
the
honor
to
go
there
,
''
continued
M.
d'Artagnan
*NL*
the
elder
,
''
--
an
honor
to
which
,
remember
,
your
ancient
nobility
gives
*NL*
you
the
right
--
sustain
worthily
your
name
of
gentleman
,
which
has
been
*NL*
worthily
borne
by
your
ancestors
for
five
hundred
years
,
both
for
your
*NL*
own
sake
and
the
sake
of
those
who
belong
to
you
.
By
the
latter
I
mean
*NL*
your
relatives
and
friends
.
Endure
nothing
from
anyone
except
Monsieur
*NL*
the
Cardinal
and
the
king
.
It
is
by
his
courage
,
please
observe
,
by
his
*NL*
courage
alone
,
that
a
gentleman
can
make
his
way
nowadays
.
Whoever
*NL*
hesitates
for
a
second
perhaps
allows
the
bait
to
escape
which
during
*NL*
that
exact
second
fortune
held
out
to
him
.
You
are
young
.
You
ought
to
*NL*
be
brave
for
two
reasons
:
the
first
is
that
you
are
a
Gascon
,
and
the
*NL*
second
is
that
you
are
my
son
.
Never
fear
quarrels
,
but
seek
adventures
.
*NL*
I
have
taught
you
how
to
handle
a
sword
;
you
have
thews
of
iron
,
a
wrist
*NL*
of
steel
.
Fight
on
all
occasions
.
Fight
the
more
for
duels
being
*NL*
forbidden
,
since
consequently
there
is
twice
as
much
courage
in
*NL*
fighting
.
I
have
nothing
to
give
you
,
my
son
,
but
fifteen
crowns
,
my
*NL*
horse
,
and
the
counsels
you
have
just
heard
.
Your
mother
will
add
to
*NL*
them
a
recipe
for
a
certain
balsam
,
which
she
had
from
a
Bohemian
and
*NL*
which
has
the
miraculous
virtue
of
curing
all
wounds
that
do
not
reach
*NL*
the
heart
.
Take
advantage
of
all
,
and
live
happily
and
long
.
I
have
but
*NL*
one
word
to
add
,
and
that
is
to
propose
an
example
to
you
--
not
mine
,
for
*NL*
I
myself
have
never
appeared
at
court
,
and
have
only
taken
part
in
*NL*
religious
wars
as
a
volunteer
;
I
speak
of
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
who
was
*NL*
formerly
my
neighbor
,
and
who
had
the
honor
to
be
,
as
a
child
,
the
*NL*
play-fellow
of
our
king
,
Louis
XIII
,
whom
God
preserve
!
Sometimes
their
*NL*
play
degenerated
into
battles
,
and
in
these
battles
the
king
was
not
*NL*
always
the
stronger
.
The
blows
which
he
received
increased
greatly
his
*NL*
esteem
and
friendship
for
Monsieur
de
Treville
.
Afterward
,
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
fought
with
others
:
in
his
first
journey
to
Paris
,
five
times
;
*NL*
from
the
death
of
the
late
king
till
the
young
one
came
of
age
,
without
*NL*
reckoning
wars
and
sieges
,
seven
times
;
and
from
that
date
up
to
the
*NL*
present
day
,
a
hundred
times
,
perhaps
!
So
that
in
spite
of
edicts
,
*NL*
ordinances
,
and
decrees
,
there
he
is
,
captain
of
the
Musketeers
;
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
chief
of
a
legion
of
Caesars
,
whom
the
king
holds
in
great
*NL*
esteem
and
whom
the
cardinal
dreads
--
he
who
dreads
nothing
,
as
it
is
*NL*
said
.
Still
further
,
Monsieur
de
Treville
gains
ten
thousand
crowns
a
*NL*
year
;
he
is
therefore
a
great
noble
.
He
began
as
you
begin
.
Go
to
him
*NL*
with
this
letter
,
and
make
him
your
model
in
order
that
you
may
do
as
he
*NL*
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
which
M.
d'Artagnan
the
elder
girded
his
own
sword
round
his
son
,
*NL*
kissed
him
tenderly
on
both
cheeks
,
and
gave
him
his
benediction
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
paternal
chamber
,
the
young
man
found
his
mother
,
who
was
*NL*
waiting
for
him
with
the
famous
recipe
of
which
the
counsels
we
have
*NL*
just
repeated
would
necessitate
frequent
employment
.
The
adieux
were
on
*NL*
this
side
longer
and
more
tender
than
they
had
been
on
the
other
--
not
*NL*
that
M.
d'Artagnan
did
not
love
his
son
,
who
was
his
only
offspring
,
but
*NL*
M.
d'Artagnan
was
a
man
,
and
he
would
have
considered
it
unworthy
of
a
*NL*
man
to
give
way
to
his
feelings
;
whereas
Mme.
d'Artagnan
was
a
woman
,
*NL*
and
still
more
,
a
mother
.
She
wept
abundantly
;
and
--
let
us
speak
it
to
*NL*
the
praise
of
M.
d'Artagnan
the
younger
--
notwithstanding
the
efforts
he
*NL*
made
to
remain
firm
,
as
a
future
Musketeer
ought
,
nature
prevailed
,
and
*NL*
he
shed
many
tears
,
of
which
he
succeeded
with
great
difficulty
in
*NL*
concealing
the
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
the
young
man
set
forward
on
his
journey
,
furnished
with
*NL*
the
three
paternal
gifts
,
which
consisted
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
fifteen
*NL*
crowns
,
the
horse
,
and
the
letter
for
M.
de
Treville
--
the
counsels
being
*NL*
thrown
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
VADE
MECUM
d'Artagnan
was
morally
and
physically
an
exact
*NL*
copy
of
the
hero
of
Cervantes
,
to
whom
we
so
happily
compared
him
when
*NL*
our
duty
of
an
historian
placed
us
under
the
necessity
of
sketching
his
*NL*
portrait
.
Don
Quixote
took
windmills
for
giants
,
and
sheep
for
armies
;
*NL*
d'Artagnan
took
every
smile
for
an
insult
,
and
every
look
as
a
*NL*
provocation
--
whence
it
resulted
that
from
Tarbes
to
Meung
his
fist
was
*NL*
constantly
doubled
,
or
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
;
and
yet
the
*NL*
fist
did
not
descend
upon
any
jaw
,
nor
did
the
sword
issue
from
its
*NL*
scabbard
.
It
was
not
that
the
sight
of
the
wretched
pony
did
not
excite
*NL*
numerous
smiles
on
the
countenances
of
passers-by
;
but
as
against
the
*NL*
side
of
this
pony
rattled
a
sword
of
respectable
length
,
and
as
over
*NL*
this
sword
gleamed
an
eye
rather
ferocious
than
haughty
,
these
*NL*
passers-by
repressed
their
hilarity
,
or
if
hilarity
prevailed
over
*NL*
prudence
,
they
endeavored
to
laugh
only
on
one
side
,
like
the
masks
of
*NL*
the
ancients
.
D'Artagnan
,
then
,
remained
majestic
and
intact
in
his
*NL*
susceptibility
,
till
he
came
to
this
unlucky
city
of
Meung
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
,
as
he
was
alighting
from
his
horse
at
the
gate
of
the
Jolly
*NL*
Miller
,
without
anyone
--
host
,
waiter
,
or
hostler
--
coming
to
hold
his
*NL*
stirrup
or
take
his
horse
,
d'Artagnan
spied
,
though
an
open
window
on
*NL*
the
ground
floor
,
a
gentleman
,
well-made
and
of
good
carriage
,
although
*NL*
of
rather
a
stern
countenance
,
talking
with
two
persons
who
appeared
to
*NL*
listen
to
him
with
respect
.
D'Artagnan
fancied
quite
naturally
,
*NL*
according
to
his
custom
,
that
he
must
be
the
object
of
their
*NL*
conversation
,
and
listened
.
This
time
d'Artagnan
was
only
in
part
*NL*
mistaken
;
he
himself
was
not
in
question
,
but
his
horse
was
.
The
*NL*
gentleman
appeared
to
be
enumerating
all
his
qualities
to
his
auditors
;
*NL*
and
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
auditors
seeming
to
have
great
deference
for
*NL*
the
narrator
,
they
every
moment
burst
into
fits
of
laughter
.
Now
,
as
a
*NL*
half-smile
was
sufficient
to
awaken
the
irascibility
of
the
young
man
,
*NL*
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
this
vociferous
mirth
may
be
easily
*NL*
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
d'Artagnan
was
desirous
of
examining
the
appearance
of
*NL*
this
impertinent
personage
who
ridiculed
him
.
He
fixed
his
haughty
eye
*NL*
upon
the
stranger
,
and
perceived
a
man
of
from
forty
to
forty-five
years
*NL*
of
age
,
with
black
and
piercing
eyes
,
pale
complexion
,
a
strongly
marked
*NL*
nose
,
and
a
black
and
well-shaped
mustache
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
doublet
*NL*
and
hose
of
a
violet
color
,
with
aiguillettes
of
the
same
color
,
without
*NL*
any
other
ornaments
than
the
customary
slashes
,
through
which
the
shirt
*NL*
appeared
.
This
doublet
and
hose
,
though
new
,
were
creased
,
like
*NL*
traveling
clothes
for
a
long
time
packed
in
a
portmanteau
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
made
all
these
remarks
with
the
rapidity
of
a
most
minute
observer
,
and
*NL*
doubtless
from
an
instinctive
feeling
that
this
stranger
was
destined
to
*NL*
have
a
great
influence
over
his
future
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
at
the
moment
in
which
d'Artagnan
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
*NL*
gentleman
in
the
violet
doublet
,
the
gentleman
made
one
of
his
most
*NL*
knowing
and
profound
remarks
respecting
the
Bearnese
pony
,
his
two
*NL*
auditors
laughed
even
louder
than
before
,
and
he
himself
,
though
*NL*
contrary
to
his
custom
,
allowed
a
pale
smile
-LRB-
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
use
*NL*
such
an
expression
-RRB-
to
stray
over
his
countenance
.
This
time
there
could
*NL*
be
no
doubt
;
d'Artagnan
was
really
insulted
.
Full
,
then
,
of
this
*NL*
conviction
,
he
pulled
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
,
and
endeavoring
to
*NL*
copy
some
of
the
court
airs
he
had
picked
up
in
Gascony
among
young
*NL*
traveling
nobles
,
he
advanced
with
one
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
*NL*
the
other
resting
on
his
hip
.
Unfortunately
,
as
he
advanced
,
his
anger
*NL*
increased
at
every
step
;
and
instead
of
the
proper
and
lofty
speech
he
*NL*
had
prepared
as
a
prelude
to
his
challenge
,
he
found
nothing
at
the
tip
*NL*
of
his
tongue
but
a
gross
personality
,
which
he
accompanied
with
a
*NL*
furious
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
sir
,
you
sir
,
who
are
hiding
yourself
behind
that
shutter
--
yes
,
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
tell
me
what
you
are
laughing
at
,
and
we
will
laugh
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
raised
his
eyes
slowly
from
the
nag
to
his
cavalier
,
as
if
*NL*
he
required
some
time
to
ascertain
whether
it
could
be
to
him
that
such
*NL*
strange
reproaches
were
addressed
;
then
,
when
he
could
not
possibly
*NL*
entertain
any
doubt
of
the
matter
,
his
eyebrows
slightly
bent
,
and
with
*NL*
an
accent
of
irony
and
insolence
impossible
to
be
described
,
he
replied
*NL*
to
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
was
not
speaking
to
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
speaking
to
you
!
''
replied
the
young
man
,
additionally
*NL*
exasperated
with
this
mixture
of
insolence
and
good
manners
,
of
*NL*
politeness
and
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
looked
at
him
again
with
a
slight
smile
,
and
retiring
from
*NL*
the
window
,
came
out
of
the
hostelry
with
a
slow
step
,
and
placed
*NL*
himself
before
the
horse
,
within
two
paces
of
d'Artagnan
.
His
quiet
*NL*
manner
and
the
ironical
expression
of
his
countenance
redoubled
the
*NL*
mirth
of
the
persons
with
whom
he
had
been
talking
,
and
who
still
*NL*
remained
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
seeing
him
approach
,
drew
his
sword
a
foot
out
of
the
*NL*
scabbard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
horse
is
decidedly
,
or
rather
has
been
in
his
youth
,
a
buttercup
,
''
*NL*
resumed
the
stranger
,
continuing
the
remarks
he
had
begun
,
and
*NL*
addressing
himself
to
his
auditors
at
the
window
,
without
paying
the
*NL*
least
attention
to
the
exasperation
of
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
however
,
placed
*NL*
himself
between
him
and
them
.
``
It
is
a
color
very
well
known
in
botany
,
*NL*
but
till
the
present
time
very
rare
among
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
people
who
laugh
at
the
horse
that
would
not
dare
to
laugh
at
*NL*
the
master
,
''
cried
the
young
emulator
of
the
furious
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
often
laugh
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
stranger
,
``
as
you
may
perceive
*NL*
by
the
expression
of
my
countenance
;
but
nevertheless
I
retain
the
*NL*
privilege
of
laughing
when
I
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
will
allow
no
man
to
laugh
when
it
*NL*
displeases
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
continued
the
stranger
,
more
calm
than
ever
;
``
well
,
that
*NL*
is
perfectly
right
!
''
and
turning
on
his
heel
,
was
about
to
re-enter
the
*NL*
hostelry
by
the
front
gate
,
beneath
which
d'Artagnan
on
arriving
had
*NL*
observed
a
saddled
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
d'Artagnan
was
not
of
a
character
to
allow
a
man
to
escape
him
thus
*NL*
who
had
the
insolence
to
ridicule
him
.
He
drew
his
sword
entirely
from
*NL*
the
scabbard
,
and
followed
him
,
crying
,
``
Turn
,
turn
,
Master
Joker
,
lest
*NL*
I
strike
you
behind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
me
!
''
said
the
other
,
turning
on
his
heels
,
and
surveying
the
*NL*
young
man
with
as
much
astonishment
as
contempt
.
``
Why
,
my
good
fellow
,
*NL*
you
must
be
mad
!
''
Then
,
in
a
suppressed
tone
,
as
if
speaking
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
This
is
annoying
,
''
continued
he
.
``
What
a
godsend
this
would
be
for
his
*NL*
Majesty
,
who
is
seeking
everywhere
for
brave
fellows
to
recruit
for
his
*NL*
Musketeers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
finished
,
when
d'Artagnan
made
such
a
furious
lunge
at
*NL*
him
that
if
he
had
not
sprung
nimbly
backward
,
it
is
probable
he
would
*NL*
have
jested
for
the
last
time
.
The
stranger
,
then
perceiving
that
the
*NL*
matter
went
beyond
raillery
,
drew
his
sword
,
saluted
his
adversary
,
and
*NL*
seriously
placed
himself
on
guard
.
But
at
the
same
moment
,
his
two
*NL*
auditors
,
accompanied
by
the
host
,
fell
upon
d'Artagnan
with
sticks
,
*NL*
shovels
and
tongs
.
This
caused
so
rapid
and
complete
a
diversion
from
*NL*
the
attack
that
d'Artagnan
's
adversary
,
while
the
latter
turned
round
to
*NL*
face
this
shower
of
blows
,
sheathed
his
sword
with
the
same
precision
,
*NL*
and
instead
of
an
actor
,
which
he
had
nearly
been
,
became
a
spectator
of
*NL*
the
fight
--
a
part
in
which
he
acquitted
himself
with
his
usual
*NL*
impassiveness
,
muttering
,
nevertheless
,
``
A
plague
upon
these
Gascons
!
*NL*
Replace
him
on
his
orange
horse
,
and
let
him
begone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
before
I
have
killed
you
,
poltroon
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
making
the
*NL*
best
face
possible
,
and
never
retreating
one
step
before
his
three
*NL*
assailants
,
who
continued
to
shower
blows
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
gasconade
!
''
murmured
the
gentleman
.
``
By
my
honor
,
these
Gascons
*NL*
are
incorrigible
!
Keep
up
the
dance
,
then
,
since
he
will
have
it
so
.
*NL*
When
he
is
tired
,
he
will
perhaps
tell
us
that
he
has
had
enough
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
stranger
knew
not
the
headstrong
personage
he
had
to
do
with
;
*NL*
d'Artagnan
was
not
the
man
ever
to
cry
for
quarter
.
The
fight
was
*NL*
therefore
prolonged
for
some
seconds
;
but
at
length
d'Artagnan
dropped
*NL*
his
sword
,
which
was
broken
in
two
pieces
by
the
blow
of
a
stick
.
*NL*
Another
blow
full
upon
his
forehead
at
the
same
moment
brought
him
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
covered
with
blood
and
almost
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
moment
that
people
came
flocking
to
the
scene
of
action
*NL*
from
all
sides
.
The
host
,
fearful
of
consequences
,
with
the
help
of
his
*NL*
servants
carried
the
wounded
man
into
the
kitchen
,
where
some
trifling
*NL*
attentions
were
bestowed
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
gentleman
,
he
resumed
his
place
at
the
window
,
and
surveyed
*NL*
the
crowd
with
a
certain
impatience
,
evidently
annoyed
by
their
*NL*
remaining
undispersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
it
with
this
madman
?
''
exclaimed
he
,
turning
round
as
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
door
announced
the
entrance
of
the
host
,
who
came
in
to
*NL*
inquire
if
he
was
unhurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
excellency
is
safe
and
sound
?
''
asked
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Perfectly
safe
and
sound
,
my
good
host
;
and
I
wish
to
know
*NL*
what
has
become
of
our
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
better
,
''
said
the
host
,
``
he
fainted
quite
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
before
he
fainted
,
he
collected
all
his
strength
to
challenge
you
,
*NL*
and
to
defy
you
while
challenging
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
fellow
must
be
the
devil
in
person
!
''
cried
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
your
Excellency
,
he
is
not
the
devil
,
''
replied
the
host
,
with
a
*NL*
grin
of
contempt
;
``
for
during
his
fainting
we
rummaged
his
valise
and
*NL*
found
nothing
but
a
clean
shirt
and
eleven
crowns
--
which
however
,
did
*NL*
not
prevent
his
saying
,
as
he
was
fainting
,
that
if
such
a
thing
had
*NL*
happened
in
Paris
,
you
should
have
cause
to
repent
of
it
at
a
later
*NL*
period
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
the
stranger
coolly
,
``
he
must
be
some
prince
in
disguise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
this
,
good
sir

resumed
the
host
,
``
in
order
that
you
*NL*
may
be
on
your
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
name
no
one
in
his
passion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
struck
his
pocket
and
said
,
`
We
shall
see
what
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
will
think
of
this
insult
offered
to
his
protege
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Treville
?
''
said
the
stranger
,
becoming
attentive
,
``
he
put
*NL*
his
hand
upon
his
pocket
while
pronouncing
the
name
of
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
?
Now
,
my
dear
host
,
while
your
young
man
was
insensible
,
you
*NL*
did
not
fail
,
I
am
quite
sure
,
to
ascertain
what
that
pocket
contained
.
*NL*
What
was
there
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
addressed
to
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
captain
of
the
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
as
I
have
the
honor
to
tell
your
Excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
,
who
was
not
endowed
with
great
perspicacity
,
did
not
observe
*NL*
the
expression
which
his
words
had
given
to
the
physiognomy
of
the
*NL*
stranger
.
The
latter
rose
from
the
front
of
the
window
,
upon
the
sill
of
*NL*
which
he
had
leaned
with
his
elbow
,
and
knitted
his
brow
like
a
man
*NL*
disquieted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
murmured
he
,
between
his
teeth
.
``
Can
Treville
have
set
this
*NL*
Gascon
upon
me
?
He
is
very
young
;
but
a
sword
thrust
is
a
sword
thrust
,
*NL*
whatever
be
the
age
of
him
who
gives
it
,
and
a
youth
is
less
to
be
*NL*
suspected
than
an
older
man

''
and
the
stranger
fell
into
a
reverie
which
*NL*
lasted
some
minutes
.
``
A
weak
obstacle
is
sometimes
sufficient
to
*NL*
overthrow
a
great
design

*NL*
*NL*
``
Host

said
he
,
``
could
you
not
contrive
to
get
rid
of
this
frantic
boy
*NL*
for
me

In
conscience
,
I
can
not
kill
him
;

yet

added
he
,
with
a
*NL*
coldly
menacing
expression
,
``
he
annoys
me

Where
is
he

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

*NL*
*NL*
``
His
things

Has
he
taken
off
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be

he

respectable

put
up
with

Go
;
make
out
my
bill
and
notify
*NL*
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

will
you
leave
us
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

very
well

as
I
gave
my
order
to
saddle
my
horse

Have
*NL*
they
not
obeyed
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done

as
your

have
observed

your

great

ready
saddled
for
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the

''
said
the
host
to
himself
.
``
Can
he
be
afraid
of
this
*NL*
boy

''
But
an
imperious
glance
from
the
stranger
stopped
him
short
;
he
*NL*
bowed
humbly
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
necessary
for
Milady

to
be

by
this
fellow

''
continued
*NL*
the
stranger
.
``
She
will
soon
pass
;
she
is
already
late
.
I
had
better
get
*NL*
on
horseback
,
and
go
and
meet
her
.
I
should
like
,
however
,
to
know
what
*NL*
this
letter
addressed
to
Treville
contains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
*
We
are
well
aware
that
this
term
,
milady
,
is
only
properly
*NL*
used
when
followed
by
a
family
name
.
But
we
find
it
thus
*NL*
in
the
manuscript
,
and
we
do
not
choose
to
take
upon
*NL*
ourselves
to
alter
it
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
stranger
,
muttering
to
himself
,
directed
his
steps
toward
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
host
,
who
entertained
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
young
man
that
drove
the
stranger
from
his
hostelry
,
*NL*
re-ascended
to
his
wife
's
chamber
,
and
found
d'Artagnan
just
recovering
*NL*
his
senses
.
Giving
him
to
understand
that
the
police
would
deal
with
him
*NL*
pretty
severely
for
having
sought
a
quarrel
with
a
great
lord
--
for
in
*NL*
the
opinion
of
the
host
the
stranger
could
be
nothing
less
than
a
great
*NL*
lord
--
he
insisted
that
notwithstanding
his
weakness
d'Artagnan
should
*NL*
get
up
and
depart
as
quickly
as
possible
.
D'Artagnan
,
half
stupefied
,
*NL*
without
his
doublet
,
and
with
his
head
bound
up
in
a
linen
cloth
,
arose
*NL*
then
,
and
urged
by
the
host
,
began
to
descend
the
stairs
;
but
on
*NL*
arriving
at
the
kitchen
,
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
his
antagonist
*NL*
talking
calmly
at
the
step
of
a
heavy
carriage
,
drawn
by
two
large
*NL*
Norman
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
interlocutor
,
whose
head
appeared
through
the
carriage
window
,
was
a
*NL*
woman
of
from
twenty
to
two-and-twenty
years
.
We
have
already
observed
*NL*
with
what
rapidity
d'Artagnan
seized
the
expression
of
a
countenance
.
He
*NL*
perceived
then
,
at
a
glance
,
that
this
woman
was
young
and
beautiful
;
*NL*
and
her
style
of
beauty
struck
him
more
forcibly
from
its
being
totally
*NL*
different
from
that
of
the
southern
countries
in
which
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
hitherto
resided
.
She
was
pale
and
fair
,
with
long
curls
falling
in
*NL*
profusion
over
her
shoulders
,
had
large
,
blue
,
languishing
eyes
,
rosy
*NL*
lips
,
and
hands
of
alabaster
.
She
was
talking
with
great
animation
with
*NL*
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
Eminence
,
then
,
orders
me
--
''
said
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
return
instantly
to
England
,
and
to
inform
him
as
soon
as
the
duke
*NL*
leaves
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
to
my
other
instructions
?
''
asked
the
fair
traveler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
contained
in
this
box
,
which
you
will
not
open
until
you
are
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
Channel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
and
you
--
what
will
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
return
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
without
chastising
this
insolent
boy
?
''
asked
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
was
about
to
reply
;
but
at
the
moment
he
opened
his
mouth
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
heard
all
,
precipitated
himself
over
the
threshold
*NL*
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
insolent
boy
chastises
others
,
''
cried
he
;
``
and
I
hope
that
this
*NL*
time
he
whom
he
ought
to
chastise
will
not
escape
him
as
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
not
escape
him
?
''
replied
the
stranger
,
knitting
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
before
a
woman
you
would
dare
not
fly
,
I
presume
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
said
Milady
,
seeing
the
stranger
lay
his
hand
on
his
sword
,
*NL*
``
the
least
delay
may
ruin
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
cried
the
gentleman
;
``
begone
then
,
on
your
part
,
and
I
*NL*
will
depart
as
quickly
on
mine
.
''
And
bowing
to
the
lady
,
he
sprang
into
*NL*
his
saddle
,
while
her
coachman
applied
his
whip
vigorously
to
his
*NL*
horses
.
The
two
interlocutors
thus
separated
,
taking
opposite
*NL*
directions
,
at
full
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pay
him
,
booby
!
''
cried
the
stranger
to
his
servant
,
without
checking
*NL*
the
speed
of
his
horse
;
and
the
man
,
after
throwing
two
or
three
silver
*NL*
pieces
at
the
foot
of
mine
host
,
galloped
after
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Base
coward
!
false
gentleman
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
springing
forward
,
in
*NL*
his
turn
,
after
the
servant
.
But
his
wound
had
rendered
him
too
weak
to
*NL*
support
such
an
exertion
.
Scarcely
had
he
gone
ten
steps
when
his
ears
*NL*
began
to
tingle
,
a
faintness
seized
him
,
a
cloud
of
blood
passed
over
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
he
fell
in
the
middle
of
the
street
,
crying
still
,
*NL*
``
Coward
!
coward
!
coward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
coward
,
indeed
,
''
grumbled
the
host
,
drawing
near
to
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
and
endeavoring
by
this
little
flattery
to
make
up
matters
with
the
*NL*
young
man
,
as
the
heron
of
the
fable
did
with
the
snail
he
had
despised
*NL*
the
evening
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
base
coward
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
she
--
she
was
very
*NL*
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
she
?
''
demanded
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Milady
,
''
faltered
d'Artagnan
,
and
fainted
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
all
one
,
''
said
the
host
;
``
I
have
lost
two
customers
,
but
this
*NL*
one
remains
,
of
whom
I
am
pretty
certain
for
some
days
to
come
.
There
*NL*
will
be
eleven
crowns
gained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
remembered
that
eleven
crowns
was
just
the
sum
that
remained
*NL*
in
d'Artagnan
's
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
had
reckoned
upon
eleven
days
of
confinement
at
a
crown
a
day
,
*NL*
but
he
had
reckoned
without
his
guest
.
On
the
following
morning
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
d'Artagnan
arose
,
and
descending
to
the
kitchen
without
help
,
*NL*
asked
,
among
other
ingredients
the
list
of
which
has
not
come
down
to
*NL*
us
,
for
some
oil
,
some
wine
,
and
some
rosemary
,
and
with
his
mother
's
*NL*
recipe
in
his
hand
composed
a
balsam
,
with
which
he
anointed
his
*NL*
numerous
wounds
,
replacing
his
bandages
himself
,
and
positively
refusing
*NL*
the
assistance
of
any
doctor
,
d'Artagnan
walked
about
that
same
evening
,
*NL*
and
was
almost
cured
by
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
time
came
to
pay
for
his
rosemary
,
this
oil
,
and
the
wine
,
*NL*
the
only
expense
the
master
had
incurred
,
as
he
had
preserved
a
strict
*NL*
abstinence
--
while
on
the
contrary
,
the
yellow
horse
,
by
the
account
of
*NL*
the
hostler
at
least
,
had
eaten
three
times
as
much
as
a
horse
of
his
*NL*
size
could
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
done
--
d'Artagnan
found
nothing
*NL*
in
his
pocket
but
his
little
old
velvet
purse
with
the
eleven
crowns
it
*NL*
contained
;
for
as
to
the
letter
addressed
to
M.
de
Treville
,
it
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
commenced
his
search
for
the
letter
with
the
greatest
*NL*
patience
,
turning
out
his
pockets
of
all
kinds
over
and
over
again
,
*NL*
rummaging
and
rerummaging
in
his
valise
,
and
opening
and
reopening
his
*NL*
purse
;
but
when
he
found
that
he
had
come
to
the
conviction
that
the
*NL*
letter
was
not
to
be
found
,
he
flew
,
for
the
third
time
,
into
such
a
*NL*
rage
as
was
near
costing
him
a
fresh
consumption
of
wine
,
oil
,
and
*NL*
rosemary
--
for
upon
seeing
this
hot-headed
youth
become
exasperated
and
*NL*
threaten
to
destroy
everything
in
the
establishment
if
his
letter
were
*NL*
not
found
,
the
host
seized
a
spit
,
his
wife
a
broom
handle
,
and
the
*NL*
servants
the
same
sticks
they
had
used
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
letter
of
recommendation
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
my
letter
of
*NL*
recommendation
!
or
,
the
holy
blood
,
I
will
spit
you
all
like
ortolans
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
there
was
one
circumstance
which
created
a
powerful
*NL*
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
of
this
threat
;
which
was
,
as
we
have
*NL*
related
,
that
his
sword
had
been
in
his
first
conflict
broken
in
two
,
*NL*
and
which
he
had
entirely
forgotten
.
Hence
,
it
resulted
when
d'Artagnan
*NL*
proceeded
to
draw
his
sword
in
earnest
,
he
found
himself
purely
and
*NL*
simply
armed
with
a
stump
of
a
sword
about
eight
or
ten
inches
in
*NL*
length
,
which
the
host
had
carefully
placed
in
the
scabbard
.
As
to
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
blade
,
the
master
had
slyly
put
that
on
one
side
to
make
*NL*
himself
a
larding
pin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
deception
would
probably
not
have
stopped
our
fiery
young
man
*NL*
if
the
host
had
not
reflected
that
the
reclamation
which
his
guest
made
*NL*
was
perfectly
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
after
all
,
''
said
he
,
lowering
the
point
of
his
spit
,
``
where
is
*NL*
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
where
is
this
letter
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
*NL*
warn
you
that
that
letter
is
for
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
and
it
must
be
*NL*
found
,
or
if
it
is
not
found
,
he
will
know
how
to
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
threat
completed
the
intimidation
of
the
host
.
After
the
king
and
*NL*
the
cardinal
,
M.
de
Treville
was
the
man
whose
name
was
perhaps
most
*NL*
frequently
repeated
by
the
military
,
and
even
by
citizens
.
There
was
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
Father
Joseph
,
but
his
name
was
never
pronounced
but
with
a
*NL*
subdued
voice
,
such
was
the
terror
inspired
by
his
Gray
Eminence
,
as
the
*NL*
cardinal
's
familiar
was
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throwing
down
his
spit
,
and
ordering
his
wife
to
do
the
same
with
her
*NL*
broom
handle
,
and
the
servants
with
their
sticks
,
he
set
the
first
*NL*
example
of
commencing
an
earnest
search
for
the
lost
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
the
letter
contain
anything
valuable
?
''
demanded
the
host
,
after
a
*NL*
few
minutes
of
useless
investigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
!
I
think
it
does
indeed
!
''
cried
the
Gascon
,
who
reckoned
upon
*NL*
this
letter
for
making
his
way
at
court
.
``
It
contained
my
fortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bills
upon
Spain
?
''
asked
the
disturbed
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bills
upon
his
Majesty
's
private
treasury
,
''
answered
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
*NL*
reckoning
upon
entering
into
the
king
's
service
in
consequence
of
this
*NL*
recommendation
,
believed
he
could
make
this
somewhat
hazardous
reply
*NL*
without
telling
of
a
falsehood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
cried
the
host
,
at
his
wit
's
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
of
no
importance
,
''
continued
d'Artagnan
,
with
natural
*NL*
assurance
;
``
it
's
of
no
importance
.
The
money
is
nothing
;
that
letter
was
*NL*
everything
.
I
would
rather
have
lost
a
thousand
pistoles
than
have
lost
*NL*
it
.
''
He
would
not
have
risked
more
if
he
had
said
twenty
thousand
;
but
a
*NL*
certain
juvenile
modesty
restrained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ray
of
light
all
at
once
broke
upon
the
mind
of
the
host
as
he
was
*NL*
giving
himself
to
the
devil
upon
finding
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
letter
is
not
lost
!
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
has
been
stolen
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stolen
?
By
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
gentleman
who
was
here
yesterday
.
He
came
down
into
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
where
your
doublet
was
.
He
remained
there
some
time
alone
.
I
would
lay
a
*NL*
wager
he
has
stolen
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
answered
d'Artagnan
,
but
little
convinced
,
as
he
knew
*NL*
better
than
anyone
else
how
entirely
personal
the
value
of
this
letter
*NL*
was
,
and
saw
nothing
in
it
likely
to
tempt
cupidity
.
The
fact
was
that
*NL*
none
of
his
servants
,
none
of
the
travelers
present
,
could
have
gained
*NL*
anything
by
being
possessed
of
this
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
,
''
resumed
d'Artagnan
,
``
that
you
suspect
that
impertinent
*NL*
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
am
sure
of
it
,
''
continued
the
host
.
``
When
I
informed
him
*NL*
that
your
lordship
was
the
protege
of
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
and
that
you
*NL*
even
had
a
letter
for
that
illustrious
gentleman
,
he
appeared
to
be
very
*NL*
much
disturbed
,
and
asked
me
where
that
letter
was
,
and
immediately
came
*NL*
down
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
knew
your
doublet
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
's
my
thief
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
will
complain
to
Monsieur
*NL*
de
Treville
,
and
Monsieur
de
Treville
will
complain
to
the
king
.
''
He
*NL*
then
drew
two
crowns
majestically
from
his
purse
and
gave
them
to
the
*NL*
host
,
who
accompanied
him
,
cap
in
hand
,
to
the
gate
,
and
remounted
his
*NL*
yellow
horse
,
which
bore
him
without
any
further
accident
to
the
gate
of
*NL*
St.
Antoine
at
Paris
,
where
his
owner
sold
him
for
three
crowns
,
which
*NL*
was
a
very
good
price
,
considering
that
d'Artagnan
had
ridden
him
hard
*NL*
during
the
last
stage
.
Thus
the
dealer
to
whom
d'Artagnan
sold
him
for
*NL*
the
nine
livres
did
not
conceal
from
the
young
man
that
he
only
gave
*NL*
that
enormous
sum
for
him
on
the
account
of
the
originality
of
his
*NL*
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
d'Artagnan
entered
Paris
on
foot
,
carrying
his
little
packet
under
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
walked
about
till
he
found
an
apartment
to
be
let
on
terms
*NL*
suited
to
the
scantiness
of
his
means
.
This
chamber
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
garret
,
situated
in
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
,
near
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
earnest
money
was
paid
,
d'Artagnan
took
possession
of
his
*NL*
lodging
,
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
sewing
onto
his
doublet
*NL*
and
hose
some
ornamental
braiding
which
his
mother
had
taken
off
an
*NL*
almost-new
doublet
of
the
elder
M.
d'Artagnan
,
and
which
she
had
given
*NL*
her
son
secretly
.
Next
he
went
to
the
Quai
de
Feraille
to
have
a
new
*NL*
blade
put
to
his
sword
,
and
then
returned
toward
the
Louvre
,
inquiring
*NL*
of
the
first
Musketeer
he
met
for
the
situation
of
the
hotel
of
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
,
which
proved
to
be
in
the
Rue
du
Vieux-Colombier
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
chamber
hired
by
d'Artagnan
--
a
*NL*
circumstance
which
appeared
to
furnish
a
happy
augury
for
the
success
of
*NL*
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
satisfied
with
the
way
in
which
he
had
conducted
himself
at
*NL*
Meung
,
without
remorse
for
the
past
,
confident
in
the
present
,
and
full
*NL*
of
hope
for
the
future
,
he
retired
to
bed
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
*NL*
brave
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sleep
,
provincial
as
it
was
,
brought
him
to
nine
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
at
which
hour
he
rose
,
in
order
to
repair
to
the
residence
of
*NL*
M.
de
Treville
,
the
third
personage
in
the
kingdom
,
in
the
paternal
*NL*
estimation
.

THE
ANTECHAMBER
OF
M.
DE
TREVILLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Troisville
,
as
his
family
was
still
called
in
Gascony
,
or
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
,
as
he
has
ended
by
styling
himself
in
Paris
,
had
really
*NL*
commenced
life
as
d'Artagnan
now
did
;
that
is
to
say
,
without
a
sou
in
*NL*
his
pocket
,
but
with
a
fund
of
audacity
,
shrewdness
,
and
intelligence
*NL*
which
makes
the
poorest
Gascon
gentleman
often
derive
more
in
his
hope
*NL*
from
the
paternal
inheritance
than
the
richest
Perigordian
or
Berrichan
*NL*
gentleman
derives
in
reality
from
his
.
His
insolent
bravery
,
his
still
*NL*
more
insolent
success
at
a
time
when
blows
poured
down
like
hail
,
had
*NL*
borne
him
to
the
top
of
that
difficult
ladder
called
Court
Favor
,
which
*NL*
he
had
climbed
four
steps
at
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
friend
of
the
king
,
who
honored
highly
,
as
everyone
knows
,
*NL*
the
memory
of
his
father
,
Henry
IV
.
The
father
of
M.
de
Treville
had
*NL*
served
him
so
faithfully
in
his
wars
against
the
league
that
in
default
*NL*
of
money
--
a
thing
to
which
the
Bearnais
was
accustomed
all
his
life
,
and
*NL*
who
constantly
paid
his
debts
with
that
of
which
he
never
stood
in
need
*NL*
of
borrowing
,
that
is
to
say
,
with
ready
wit
--
in
default
of
money
,
we
*NL*
repeat
,
he
authorized
him
,
after
the
reduction
of
Paris
,
to
assume
for
*NL*
his
arms
a
golden
lion
passant
upon
gules
,
with
the
motto
FIDELIS
ET
*NL*
FORTIS
.
This
was
a
great
matter
in
the
way
of
honor
,
but
very
little
in
*NL*
the
way
of
wealth
;
so
that
when
the
illustrious
companion
of
the
great
*NL*
Henry
died
,
the
only
inheritance
he
was
able
to
leave
his
son
was
his
*NL*
sword
and
his
motto
.
Thanks
to
this
double
gift
and
the
spotless
name
*NL*
that
accompanied
it
,
M.
de
Treville
was
admitted
into
the
household
of
*NL*
the
young
prince
where
he
made
such
good
use
of
his
sword
,
and
was
so
*NL*
faithful
to
his
motto
,
that
Louis
XIII
,
one
of
the
good
blades
of
his
*NL*
kingdom
,
was
accustomed
to
say
that
if
he
had
a
friend
who
was
about
to
*NL*
fight
,
he
would
advise
him
to
choose
as
a
second
,
himself
first
,
and
*NL*
Treville
next
--
or
even
,
perhaps
,
before
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Louis
XIII
had
a
real
liking
for
Treville
--
a
royal
liking
,
a
*NL*
self-interested
liking
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
a
liking
.
At
that
unhappy
*NL*
period
it
was
an
important
consideration
to
be
surrounded
by
such
men
as
*NL*
Treville
.
Many
might
take
for
their
device
the
epithet
STRONG
,
which
*NL*
formed
the
second
part
of
his
motto
,
but
very
few
gentlemen
could
lay
*NL*
claim
to
the
FAITHFUL
,
which
constituted
the
first
.
Treville
was
one
of
*NL*
these
latter
.
His
was
one
of
those
rare
organizations
,
endowed
with
an
*NL*
obedient
intelligence
like
that
of
the
dog
;
with
a
blind
valor
,
a
quick
*NL*
eye
,
and
a
prompt
hand
;
to
whom
sight
appeared
only
to
be
given
to
see
*NL*
if
the
king
were
dissatisfied
with
anyone
,
and
the
hand
to
strike
this
*NL*
displeasing
personage
,
whether
a
Besme
,
a
Maurevers
,
a
Poltiot
de
Mere
,
*NL*
or
a
Vitry
.
In
short
,
up
to
this
period
nothing
had
been
wanting
to
*NL*
Treville
but
opportunity
;
but
he
was
ever
on
the
watch
for
it
,
and
he
*NL*
faithfully
promised
himself
that
he
would
not
fail
to
seize
it
by
its
*NL*
three
hairs
whenever
it
came
within
reach
of
his
hand
.
At
last
Louis
*NL*
XIII
made
Treville
the
captain
of
his
Musketeers
,
who
were
to
Louis
XIII
*NL*
in
devotedness
,
or
rather
in
fanaticism
,
what
his
Ordinaries
had
been
to
*NL*
Henry
III
,
and
his
Scotch
Guard
to
Louis
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
part
,
the
cardinal
was
not
behind
the
king
in
this
respect
.
When
*NL*
he
saw
the
formidable
and
chosen
body
with
which
Louis
XIII
had
*NL*
surrounded
himself
,
this
second
,
or
rather
this
first
king
of
France
,
*NL*
became
desirous
that
he
,
too
,
should
have
his
guard
.
He
had
his
*NL*
Musketeers
therefore
,
as
Louis
XIII
had
his
,
and
these
two
powerful
*NL*
rivals
vied
with
each
other
in
procuring
,
not
only
from
all
the
*NL*
provinces
of
France
,
but
even
from
all
foreign
states
,
the
most
*NL*
celebrated
swordsmen
.
It
was
not
uncommon
for
Richelieu
and
Louis
XIII
*NL*
to
dispute
over
their
evening
game
of
chess
upon
the
merits
of
their
*NL*
servants
.
Each
boasted
the
bearing
and
the
courage
of
his
own
people
.
*NL*
While
exclaiming
loudly
against
duels
and
brawls
,
they
excited
them
*NL*
secretly
to
quarrel
,
deriving
an
immoderate
satisfaction
or
genuine
*NL*
regret
from
the
success
or
defeat
of
their
own
combatants
.
We
learn
this
*NL*
from
the
memoirs
of
a
man
who
was
concerned
in
some
few
of
these
defeats
*NL*
and
in
many
of
these
victories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Treville
had
grasped
the
weak
side
of
his
master
;
and
it
was
to
this
*NL*
address
that
he
owed
the
long
and
constant
favor
of
a
king
who
has
not
*NL*
left
the
reputation
behind
him
of
being
very
faithful
in
his
*NL*
friendships
.
He
paraded
his
Musketeers
before
the
Cardinal
Armand
*NL*
Duplessis
with
an
insolent
air
which
made
the
gray
moustache
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
curl
with
ire
.
Treville
understood
admirably
the
war
method
of
*NL*
that
period
,
in
which
he
who
could
not
live
at
the
expense
of
the
enemy
*NL*
must
live
at
the
expense
of
his
compatriots
.
His
soldiers
formed
a
*NL*
legion
of
devil-may-care
fellows
,
perfectly
undisciplined
toward
all
but
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Loose
,
half-drunk
,
imposing
,
the
king
's
Musketeers
,
or
rather
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
's
,
spread
themselves
about
in
the
cabarets
,
in
the
public
*NL*
walks
,
and
the
public
sports
,
shouting
,
twisting
their
mustaches
,
*NL*
clanking
their
swords
,
and
taking
great
pleasure
in
annoying
the
Guards
*NL*
of
the
cardinal
whenever
they
could
fall
in
with
them
;
then
drawing
in
*NL*
the
open
streets
,
as
if
it
were
the
best
of
all
possible
sports
;
*NL*
sometimes
killed
,
but
sure
in
that
case
to
be
both
wept
and
avenged
;
*NL*
often
killing
others
,
but
then
certain
of
not
rotting
in
prison
,
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
being
there
to
claim
them
.
Thus
M.
de
Treville
was
praised
to
*NL*
the
highest
note
by
these
men
,
who
adored
him
,
and
who
,
ruffians
as
they
*NL*
were
,
trembled
before
him
like
scholars
before
their
master
,
obedient
to
*NL*
his
least
word
,
and
ready
to
sacrifice
themselves
to
wash
out
the
*NL*
smallest
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
employed
this
powerful
weapon
for
the
king
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
and
the
friends
of
the
king
--
and
then
for
himself
and
his
own
*NL*
friends
.
For
the
rest
,
in
the
memoirs
of
this
period
,
which
has
left
so
*NL*
many
memoirs
,
one
does
not
find
this
worthy
gentleman
blamed
even
by
his
*NL*
enemies
;
and
he
had
many
such
among
men
of
the
pen
as
well
as
among
men
*NL*
of
the
sword
.
In
no
instance
,
let
us
say
,
was
this
worthy
gentleman
*NL*
accused
of
deriving
personal
advantage
from
the
cooperation
of
his
*NL*
minions
.
Endowed
with
a
rare
genius
for
intrigue
which
rendered
him
the
*NL*
equal
of
the
ablest
intriguers
,
he
remained
an
honest
man
.
Still
*NL*
further
,
in
spite
of
sword
thrusts
which
weaken
,
and
painful
exercises
*NL*
which
fatigue
,
he
had
become
one
of
the
most
gallant
frequenters
of
*NL*
revels
,
one
of
the
most
insinuating
lady
's
men
,
one
of
the
softest
*NL*
whisperers
of
interesting
nothings
of
his
day
;
the
BONNES
FORTUNES
of
de
*NL*
Treville
were
talked
of
as
those
of
M.
de
Bassompierre
had
been
talked
*NL*
of
twenty
years
before
,
and
that
was
not
saying
a
little
.
The
captain
of
*NL*
the
Musketeers
was
therefore
admired
,
feared
,
and
loved
;
and
this
*NL*
constitutes
the
zenith
of
human
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XIV
absorbed
all
the
smaller
stars
of
his
court
in
his
own
vast
*NL*
radiance
;
but
his
father
,
a
sun
PLURIBUS
IMPAR
,
left
his
personal
*NL*
splendor
to
each
of
his
favorites
,
his
individual
value
to
each
of
his
*NL*
courtiers
.
In
addition
to
the
leeves
of
the
king
and
the
cardinal
,
there
*NL*
might
be
reckoned
in
Paris
at
that
time
more
than
two
hundred
smaller
*NL*
but
still
noteworthy
leeves
.
Among
these
two
hundred
leeves
,
that
of
*NL*
Treville
was
one
of
the
most
sought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
court
of
his
hotel
,
situated
in
the
Rue
du
Vieux-Colombier
,
*NL*
resembled
a
camp
from
by
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
summer
and
eight
*NL*
o'clock
in
winter
.
From
fifty
to
sixty
Musketeers
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
replace
one
another
in
order
always
to
present
an
imposing
number
,
*NL*
paraded
constantly
,
armed
to
the
teeth
and
ready
for
anything
.
On
one
of
*NL*
those
immense
staircases
,
upon
whose
space
modern
civilization
would
*NL*
build
a
whole
house
,
ascended
and
descended
the
office
seekers
of
Paris
,
*NL*
who
ran
after
any
sort
of
favor
--
gentlemen
from
the
provinces
anxious
to
*NL*
be
enrolled
,
and
servants
in
all
sorts
of
liveries
,
bringing
and
*NL*
carrying
messages
between
their
masters
and
M.
de
Treville
.
In
the
*NL*
antechamber
,
upon
long
circular
benches
,
reposed
the
elect
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
those
who
were
called
.
In
this
apartment
a
continued
buzzing
*NL*
prevailed
from
morning
till
night
,
while
M.
de
Treville
,
in
his
office
*NL*
contiguous
to
this
antechamber
,
received
visits
,
listened
to
complaints
,
*NL*
gave
his
orders
,
and
like
the
king
in
his
balcony
at
the
Louvre
,
had
*NL*
only
to
place
himself
at
the
window
to
review
both
his
men
and
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
on
which
d'Artagnan
presented
himself
the
assemblage
was
*NL*
imposing
,
particularly
for
a
provincial
just
arriving
from
his
province
.
*NL*
It
is
true
that
this
provincial
was
a
Gascon
;
and
that
,
particularly
at
*NL*
this
period
,
the
compatriots
of
d'Artagnan
had
the
reputation
of
not
*NL*
being
easily
intimidated
.
When
he
had
once
passed
the
massive
door
*NL*
covered
with
long
square-headed
nails
,
he
fell
into
the
midst
of
a
troop
*NL*
of
swordsmen
,
who
crossed
one
another
in
their
passage
,
calling
out
,
*NL*
quarreling
,
and
playing
tricks
one
with
another
.
In
order
to
make
one
's
*NL*
way
amid
these
turbulent
and
conflicting
waves
,
it
was
necessary
to
be
*NL*
an
officer
,
a
great
noble
,
or
a
pretty
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
then
,
into
the
midst
of
this
tumult
and
disorder
that
our
young
*NL*
man
advanced
with
a
beating
heart
,
ranging
his
long
rapier
up
his
lanky
*NL*
leg
,
and
keeping
one
hand
on
the
edge
of
his
cap
,
with
that
half-smile
*NL*
of
the
embarrassed
provincial
who
wishes
to
put
on
a
good
face
.
When
he
*NL*
had
passed
one
group
he
began
to
breathe
more
freely
;
but
he
could
not
*NL*
help
observing
that
they
turned
round
to
look
at
him
,
and
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
his
life
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
till
that
day
entertained
a
very
*NL*
good
opinion
of
himself
,
felt
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
staircase
,
it
was
still
worse
.
There
were
four
Musketeers
*NL*
on
the
bottom
steps
,
amusing
themselves
with
the
following
exercise
,
*NL*
while
ten
or
twelve
of
their
comrades
waited
upon
the
landing
place
to
*NL*
take
their
turn
in
the
sport
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
,
stationed
upon
the
top
stair
,
naked
sword
in
hand
,
*NL*
prevented
,
or
at
least
endeavored
to
prevent
,
the
three
others
from
*NL*
ascending
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
three
others
fenced
against
him
with
their
agile
swords
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
at
first
took
these
weapons
for
foils
,
and
believed
them
to
*NL*
be
buttoned
;
but
he
soon
perceived
by
certain
scratches
that
every
*NL*
weapon
was
pointed
and
sharpened
,
and
that
at
each
of
these
scratches
*NL*
not
only
the
spectators
,
but
even
the
actors
themselves
,
laughed
like
so
*NL*
many
madmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
at
the
moment
occupied
the
upper
step
kept
his
adversaries
*NL*
marvelously
in
check
.
A
circle
was
formed
around
them
.
The
conditions
*NL*
required
that
at
every
hit
the
man
touched
should
quit
the
game
,
*NL*
yielding
his
turn
for
the
benefit
of
the
adversary
who
had
hit
him
.
In
*NL*
five
minutes
three
were
slightly
wounded
,
one
on
the
hand
,
another
on
*NL*
the
ear
,
by
the
defender
of
the
stair
,
who
himself
remained
intact
--
a
*NL*
piece
of
skill
which
was
worth
to
him
,
according
to
the
rules
agreed
*NL*
upon
,
three
turns
of
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
difficult
it
might
be
,
or
rather
as
he
pretended
it
was
,
to
*NL*
astonish
our
young
traveler
,
this
pastime
really
astonished
him
.
He
had
*NL*
seen
in
his
province
--
that
land
in
which
heads
become
so
easily
*NL*
heated
--
a
few
of
the
preliminaries
of
duels
;
but
the
daring
of
these
*NL*
four
fencers
appeared
to
him
the
strongest
he
had
ever
heard
of
even
in
*NL*
Gascony
.
He
believed
himself
transported
into
that
famous
country
of
*NL*
giants
into
which
Gulliver
afterward
went
and
was
so
frightened
;
and
yet
*NL*
he
had
not
gained
the
goal
,
for
there
were
still
the
landing
place
and
*NL*
the
antechamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
landing
they
were
no
longer
fighting
,
but
amused
themselves
with
*NL*
stories
about
women
,
and
in
the
antechamber
,
with
stories
about
the
*NL*
court
.
On
the
landing
d'Artagnan
blushed
;
in
the
antechamber
he
*NL*
trembled
.
His
warm
and
fickle
imagination
,
which
in
Gascony
had
rendered
*NL*
him
formidable
to
young
chambermaids
,
and
even
sometimes
their
*NL*
mistresses
,
had
never
dreamed
,
even
in
moments
of
delirium
,
of
half
the
*NL*
amorous
wonders
or
a
quarter
of
the
feats
of
gallantry
which
were
here
*NL*
set
forth
in
connection
with
names
the
best
known
and
with
details
the
*NL*
least
concealed
.
But
if
his
morals
were
shocked
on
the
landing
,
his
*NL*
respect
for
the
cardinal
was
scandalized
in
the
antechamber
.
There
,
to
*NL*
his
great
astonishment
,
d'Artagnan
heard
the
policy
which
made
all
*NL*
Europe
tremble
criticized
aloud
and
openly
,
as
well
as
the
private
life
*NL*
of
the
cardinal
,
which
so
many
great
nobles
had
been
punished
for
trying
*NL*
to
pry
into
.
That
great
man
who
was
so
revered
by
d'Artagnan
the
elder
*NL*
served
as
an
object
of
ridicule
to
the
Musketeers
of
Treville
,
who
*NL*
cracked
their
jokes
upon
his
bandy
legs
and
his
crooked
back
.
Some
sang
*NL*
ballads
about
Mme.
d'Aguillon
,
his
mistress
,
and
Mme.
Cambalet
,
his
*NL*
niece
;
while
others
formed
parties
and
plans
to
annoy
the
pages
and
*NL*
guards
of
the
cardinal
duke
--
all
things
which
appeared
to
d'Artagnan
*NL*
monstrous
impossibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
the
name
of
the
king
was
now
and
then
uttered
*NL*
unthinkingly
amid
all
these
cardinal
jests
,
a
sort
of
gag
seemed
to
*NL*
close
for
a
moment
on
all
these
jeering
mouths
.
They
looked
hesitatingly
*NL*
around
them
,
and
appeared
to
doubt
the
thickness
of
the
partition
*NL*
between
them
and
the
office
of
M.
de
Treville
;
but
a
fresh
allusion
soon
*NL*
brought
back
the
conversation
to
his
Eminence
,
and
then
the
laughter
*NL*
recovered
its
loudness
and
the
light
was
not
withheld
from
any
of
his
*NL*
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certes
,
these
fellows
will
all
either
be
imprisoned
or
hanged
,
''
thought
*NL*
the
terrified
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
I
,
no
doubt
,
with
them
;
for
from
the
*NL*
moment
I
have
either
listened
to
or
heard
them
,
I
shall
be
held
as
an
*NL*
accomplice
.
What
would
my
good
father
say
,
who
so
strongly
pointed
out
*NL*
to
me
the
respect
due
to
the
cardinal
,
if
he
knew
I
was
in
the
society
*NL*
of
such
pagans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
no
need
,
therefore
,
to
say
that
d'Artagnan
dared
not
join
in
the
*NL*
conversation
,
only
he
looked
with
all
his
eyes
and
listened
with
all
his
*NL*
ears
,
stretching
his
five
senses
so
as
to
lose
nothing
;
and
despite
his
*NL*
confidence
on
the
paternal
admonitions
,
he
felt
himself
carried
by
his
*NL*
tastes
and
led
by
his
instincts
to
praise
rather
than
to
blame
the
*NL*
unheard-of
things
which
were
taking
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
court
of
M.
de
Treville
's
*NL*
courtiers
,
and
this
his
first
appearance
in
that
place
,
he
was
at
length
*NL*
noticed
,
and
somebody
came
and
asked
him
what
he
wanted
.
At
this
demand
*NL*
d'Artagnan
gave
his
name
very
modestly
,
emphasized
the
title
of
*NL*
compatriot
,
and
begged
the
servant
who
had
put
the
question
to
him
to
*NL*
request
a
moment
's
audience
of
M.
de
Treville
--
a
request
which
the
*NL*
other
,
with
an
air
of
protection
,
promised
to
transmit
in
due
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
a
little
recovered
from
his
first
surprise
,
had
now
leisure
*NL*
to
study
costumes
and
physiognomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
center
of
the
most
animated
group
was
a
Musketeer
of
great
height
*NL*
and
haughty
countenance
,
dressed
in
a
costume
so
peculiar
as
to
attract
*NL*
general
attention
.
He
did
not
wear
the
uniform
cloak
--
which
was
not
*NL*
obligatory
at
that
epoch
of
less
liberty
but
more
independence
--
but
a
*NL*
cerulean-blue
doublet
,
a
little
faded
and
worn
,
and
over
this
a
*NL*
magnificent
baldric
,
worked
in
gold
,
which
shone
like
water
ripples
in
*NL*
the
sun
.
A
long
cloak
of
crimson
velvet
fell
in
graceful
folds
from
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
disclosing
in
front
the
splendid
baldric
,
from
which
was
*NL*
suspended
a
gigantic
rapier
.
This
Musketeer
had
just
come
off
guard
,
*NL*
complained
of
having
a
cold
,
and
coughed
from
time
to
time
affectedly
.
*NL*
It
was
for
this
reason
,
as
he
said
to
those
around
him
,
that
he
had
put
*NL*
on
his
cloak
;
and
while
he
spoke
with
a
lofty
air
and
twisted
his
*NL*
mustache
disdainfully
,
all
admired
his
embroidered
baldric
,
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
more
than
anyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
?
''
said
the
Musketeer
.
``
This
fashion
is
coming
in
.
*NL*
It
is
a
folly
,
I
admit
,
but
still
it
is
the
fashion
.
Besides
,
one
must
*NL*
lay
out
one
's
inheritance
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Porthos
!
''
cried
one
of
his
companions
,
``
do
n't
try
to
make
us
*NL*
believe
you
obtained
that
baldric
by
paternal
generosity
.
It
was
given
*NL*
to
you
by
that
veiled
lady
I
met
you
with
the
other
Sunday
,
near
the
*NL*
gate
St.
Honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
upon
honor
and
by
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
,
I
bought
it
with
the
*NL*
contents
of
my
own
purse
,
''
answered
he
whom
they
designated
by
the
name
*NL*
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
about
in
the
same
manner
,
''
said
another
Musketeer
,
``
that
I
bought
*NL*
this
new
purse
with
what
my
mistress
put
into
the
old
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
though
,
''
said
Porthos
;
``
and
the
proof
is
that
I
paid
twelve
*NL*
pistoles
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wonder
was
increased
,
though
the
doubt
continued
to
exist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
not
true
,
Aramis
?
''
said
Porthos
,
turning
toward
another
*NL*
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
other
Musketeer
formed
a
perfect
contrast
to
his
interrogator
,
who
*NL*
had
just
designated
him
by
the
name
of
Aramis
.
He
was
a
stout
man
,
of
*NL*
about
two
-
or
three-and-twenty
,
with
an
open
,
ingenuous
countenance
,
a
*NL*
black
,
mild
eye
,
and
cheeks
rosy
and
downy
as
an
autumn
peach
.
His
*NL*
delicate
mustache
marked
a
perfectly
straight
line
upon
his
upper
lip
;
*NL*
he
appeared
to
dread
to
lower
his
hands
lest
their
veins
should
swell
,
*NL*
and
he
pinched
the
tips
of
his
ears
from
time
to
time
to
preserve
their
*NL*
delicate
pink
transparency
.
Habitually
he
spoke
little
and
slowly
,
bowed
*NL*
frequently
,
laughed
without
noise
,
showing
his
teeth
,
which
were
fine
*NL*
and
of
which
,
as
the
rest
of
his
person
,
he
appeared
to
take
great
care
.
*NL*
He
answered
the
appeal
of
his
friend
by
an
affirmative
nod
of
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
affirmation
appeared
to
dispel
all
doubts
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
baldric
.
They
continued
to
admire
it
,
but
said
no
more
about
it
;
and
*NL*
with
a
rapid
change
of
thought
,
the
conversation
passed
suddenly
to
*NL*
another
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
the
story
Chalais
's
esquire
relates
?
''
asked
*NL*
another
Musketeer
,
without
addressing
anyone
in
particular
,
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
speaking
to
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
he
say
?
''
asked
Porthos
,
in
a
self-sufficient
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
relates
that
he
met
at
Brussels
Rochefort
,
the
AME
DAMNEE
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
disguised
as
a
Capuchin
,
and
that
this
cursed
Rochefort
,
thanks
*NL*
to
his
disguise
,
had
tricked
Monsieur
de
Laigues
,
like
a
ninny
as
he
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ninny
,
indeed
!
''
said
Porthos
;
``
but
is
the
matter
certain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
it
from
Aramis
,
''
replied
the
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
knew
it
,
Porthos
,
''
said
Aramis
.
``
I
told
you
of
it
yesterday
.
*NL*
Let
us
say
no
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
about
it

That
's
YOUR
opinion

replied
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
about
it
!
PESTE
!
You
come
to
your
conclusions
quickly

*NL*
What
!
The
cardinal
sets
a
spy
upon
a
gentleman
,
has
his
letters
stolen
*NL*
from
him
by
means
of
a
traitor
,
a
brigand
,
a
rascal

has

with
the
help
*NL*
of
this
spy
and
thanks
to
this
correspondence
,
Chalais
's
throat
cut
,
*NL*
under
the
stupid
pretext
that
he
wanted
to
kill
the
king
and
marry
*NL*
Monsieur
to
the
queen
!
Nobody
knew
a
word
of
this
enigma

You
unraveled
*NL*
it
yesterday
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
;
and
while
we
are
still
*NL*
gaping
with
wonder
at
the
news
,
you
come
and
tell
us
today

Let

no
more
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
us
talk
about
it
,
since
you
desire
it

replied
Aramis
,
*NL*
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Rochefort

''
cried
Porthos
,
``
if
I
were
the
esquire
of
poor
Chalais

*NL*
should
pass
a
minute
or
two
very
uncomfortably
with
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

you
would
pass
rather
a
sad
quarter-hour
with
the
Red
Duke

*NL*

Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

the
Red
Duke

Bravo

Bravo

cried
Porthos

clapping
*NL*
his
hands
and
nodding
his
head

``
The
Red
Duke

I
'll
circulate

that
saying

assured

my

Who
says
this
Aramis

not

What
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
only
a
temporary
postponement

replied
Aramis
;
``
I
shall
be

one
someday

You

*NL*
*NL*

Porthos

later

*NL*
``
Sooner

*NL*
``

another

They
say

replied
Aramis
,
*NL*
with
a
significant
smile
which
gave
to
this
sentence
,
apparently
so
*NL*
simple
,
a
tolerably
scandalous
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

good
friend

interrupted
Porthos

*NL*
``

always
leading
you
beyond

mild
eye
a
flash
passed
like
lightning

Porthos
.
``
You
know

Athos
told
you
the
other
day

eat
at

mess

Ah

do
n't
be
angry
,
I
beg
of
you
,
that
would
be
*NL*
useless

you
know
what
is
agreed

between
you

You
go

a

At
this

during

everyone

became
mute

amid

general
silence
the
young
man
crossed
part
of

the
length
of
the
antechamber
,
and
entered
the
apartment
of
the
captain

of

Musketeers

congratulating
himself
with

THE
AUDIENCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
was
at
the
moment
in
rather
ill-humor
,
nevertheless
he
*NL*
saluted
the
young
man
politely
,
who
bowed
to
the
very
ground
;
and
he
*NL*
smiled
on
receiving
d'Artagnan
's
response
,
the
Bearnese
accent
of
which
*NL*
recalled
to
him
at
the
same
time
his
youth
and
his
country
--
a
double
*NL*
remembrance
which
makes
a
man
smile
at
all
ages
;
but
stepping
toward
the
*NL*
antechamber
and
making
a
sign
to
d'Artagnan
with
his
hand
,
as
if
to
ask
*NL*
his
permission
to
finish
with
others
before
he
began
with
him
,
he
called
*NL*
three
times
,
with
a
louder
voice
at
each
time
,
so
that
he
ran
through
*NL*
the
intervening
tones
between
the
imperative
accent
and
the
angry
*NL*
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos
!
Porthos
!
Aramis
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Musketeers
with
whom
we
have
already
made
acquaintance
,
and
who
*NL*
answered
to
the
last
of
these
three
names
,
immediately
quitted
the
group
*NL*
of
which
they
had
formed
a
part
,
and
advanced
toward
the
cabinet
,
the
*NL*
door
of
which
closed
after
them
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
.
Their
*NL*
appearance
,
although
it
was
not
quite
at
ease
,
excited
by
its
*NL*
carelessness
,
at
once
full
of
dignity
and
submission
,
the
admiration
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
beheld
in
these
two
men
demigods
,
and
in
their
leader
an
*NL*
Olympian
Jupiter
,
armed
with
all
his
thunders
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
Musketeers
had
entered
;
when
the
door
was
closed
behind
*NL*
them
;
when
the
buzzing
murmur
of
the
antechamber
,
to
which
the
summons
*NL*
which
had
been
made
had
doubtless
furnished
fresh
food
,
had
recommenced
;
*NL*
when
M.
de
Treville
had
three
or
four
times
paced
in
silence
,
and
with
a
*NL*
frowning
brow
,
the
whole
length
of
his
cabinet
,
passing
each
time
before
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
who
were
as
upright
and
silent
as
if
on
parade
--
he
*NL*
stopped
all
at
once
full
in
front
of
them
,
and
covering
them
from
head
*NL*
to
foot
with
an
angry
look
,
``
Do
you
know
what
the
king
said
to
me
,
''
*NL*
cried
he
,
``
and
that
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
evening

do
you
know

*NL*
gentlemen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
two
Musketeers
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
``
no
,
sir
,
we
*NL*
do
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
that
you
will
do
us
the
honor
to
tell
us
,
''
added
Aramis
,
in
*NL*
his
politest
tone
and
with
his
most
graceful
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
told
me
that
he
should
henceforth
recruit
his
Musketeers
from
among
*NL*
the
Guards
of
Monsieur
the
Cardinal

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Guards
of
the
cardinal
!
And
why
so
?

asked
Porthos
,
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
plainly
perceives
that
his
piquette

stands
in
need
of
being
*NL*
enlivened
by
a
mixture
of
good
wine

A
watered
liquor

from
the
second
pressing
of
the
grape

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Musketeers
reddened
to
the
whites
of
their
eyes
.
D'Artagnan
did
*NL*
not
know
where
he
was
,
and
wished
himself
a
hundred
feet
underground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

continued
M.
de
Treville
,
growing
warmer
as
he
spoke
,
``
and
*NL*
his
majesty
was
right
;
for
,
upon
my
honor
,
it
is
true
that
the
*NL*
Musketeers
make
but
a
miserable
figure
at
court
.
The
cardinal
related
*NL*
yesterday
while
playing
with
the
king
,
with
an
air
of
condolence
very
*NL*
displeasing
to
me
,
that
the
day
before
yesterday
those
DAMNED
*NL*
MUSKETEERS
,
those
DAREDEVILS

he
dwelt
upon
those
words
with
an
ironical
*NL*
tone
still
more
displeasing
to
me
--
those
BRAGGARTS

added
he
,
glancing
*NL*
at
me
with
his
tiger-cat
's
eye
,
had
made
a
riot
in
the
Rue
Ferou
in
a
*NL*
cabaret
,
and
that
a
party
of
his
Guards

I
thought
he
was
going
to
laugh

in

something

Arrest
Musketeers

You
were

them

you
*NL*
were
!
Do
n't
deny
it
;
you
were
recognized

the
cardinal
named
you
.
*NL*
But
it
's
all
my
fault
;
yes
,
it
's
all
my
fault
,
because
it
is
myself
who
*NL*
selects
my
men

You

why
the

did
you
ask
me
for

uniform

you
would

been
so
much
better

And

And

It

Porthos

desirous

conversation

is
serious
is
*NL*
that
it
will
certainly
spoil
his
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
smallpox
!
That
's
a
great
story
to
tell
me
,
Porthos
!
Sick
of
the
*NL*
smallpox
at
his
age
!
No
,
no
;
but
wounded
without
doubt
,
killed
,
perhaps
.
*NL*
Ah
,
if
I
knew
!
S'blood
!
Messieurs
Musketeers
,
I
will
not
have
this
*NL*
haunting
of
bad
places
,
this
quarreling
in
the
streets
,
this
swordplay
*NL*
at
the
crossways
;
and
above
all
,
I
will
not
have
occasion
given
for
the
*NL*
cardinal
's
Guards
,
who
are
brave
,
quiet
,
skillful
men
who
never
put
*NL*
themselves
in
a
position
to
be
arrested
,
and
who
,
besides
,
never
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
arrested
,
to
laugh
at
you
!
I
am
sure
of
it
--
they
would
*NL*
prefer
dying
on
the
spot
to
being
arrested
or
taking
back
a
step
.
To
*NL*
save
yourselves
,
to
scamper
away
,
to
flee
--
that
is
good
for
the
king
's
*NL*
Musketeers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
trembled
with
rage
.
They
could
willingly
have
*NL*
strangled
M.
de
Treville
,
if
,
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
,
they
had
not
*NL*
felt
it
was
the
great
love
he
bore
them
which
made
him
speak
thus
.
They
*NL*
stamped
upon
the
carpet
with
their
feet
;
they
bit
their
lips
till
the
*NL*
blood
came
,
and
grasped
the
hilts
of
their
swords
with
all
their
might
.
*NL*
All
without
had
heard
,
as
we
have
said
,
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
*NL*
called
,
and
had
guessed
,
from
M.
de
Treville
's
tone
of
voice
,
that
he
*NL*
was
very
angry
about
something
.
Ten
curious
heads
were
glued
to
the
*NL*
tapestry
and
became
pale
with
fury
;
for
their
ears
,
closely
applied
to
*NL*
the
door
,
did
not
lose
a
syllable
of
what
he
said
,
while
their
mouths
*NL*
repeated
as
he
went
on
,
the
insulting
expressions
of
the
captain
to
all
*NL*
the
people
in
the
antechamber
.
In
an
instant
,
from
the
door
of
the
*NL*
cabinet
to
the
street
gate
,
the
whole
hotel
was
boiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
The
king
's
Musketeers
are
arrested
by
the
Guards
of
the
cardinal
,
*NL*
are
they
?
''
continued
M.
de
Treville
,
as
furious
at
heart
as
his
*NL*
soldiers
,
but
emphasizing
his
words
and
plunging
them
,
one
by
one
,
so
to
*NL*
say
,
like
so
many
blows
of
a
stiletto
,
into
the
bosoms
of
his
auditors
.
*NL*
``
What
!
Six
of
his
Eminence
's
Guards
arrest
six
of
his
Majesty
's
*NL*
Musketeers
!
MORBLEU
!
My
part
is
taken
!
I
will
go
straight
to
the
louvre
;
*NL*
I
will
give
in
my
resignation
as
captain
of
the
king
's
Musketeers
to
*NL*
take
a
lieutenancy
in
the
cardinal
's
Guards
,
and
if
he
refuses
me
,
*NL*
MORBLEU
!
I
will
turn
abbe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
the
murmur
without
became
an
explosion
;
nothing
was
to
*NL*
be
heard
but
oaths
and
blasphemies
.
The
MORBLEUS
,
the
SANG
DIEUS
,
the
*NL*
MORTS
TOUTS
LES
DIABLES
,
crossed
one
another
in
the
air
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
looked
for
some
tapestry
behind
which
he
might
hide
himself
,
and
felt
an
*NL*
immense
inclination
to
crawl
under
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
Captain
,
''
said
Porthos
,
quite
beside
himself
,
``
the
truth
is
*NL*
that
we
were
six
against
six
.
But
we
were
not
captured
by
fair
means
;
*NL*
and
before
we
had
time
to
draw
our
swords
,
two
of
our
party
were
dead
,
*NL*
and
Athos
,
grievously
wounded
,
was
very
little
better
.
For
you
know
*NL*
Athos
.
Well
,
Captain
,
he
endeavored
twice
to
get
up
,
and
fell
again
*NL*
twice
.
And
we
did
not
surrender
--
no
!
They
dragged
us
away
by
force
.
On
*NL*
the
way
we
escaped
.
As
for
Athos
,
they
believed
him
to
be
dead
,
and
left
*NL*
him
very
quiet
on
the
field
of
battle
,
not
thinking
it
worth
the
trouble
*NL*
to
carry
him
away
.
That
's
the
whole
story
.
What
the
devil
,
Captain
,
one
*NL*
can
not
win
all
one
's
battles
!
The
great
Pompey
lost
that
of
Pharsalia
;
*NL*
and
Francis
the
First
,
who
was
,
as
I
have
heard
say
,
as
good
as
other
*NL*
folks
,
nevertheless
lost
the
Battle
of
Pavia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
the
honor
of
assuring
you
that
I
killed
one
of
them
with
his
*NL*
own
sword
,
''
said
Aramis
;
``
for
mine
was
broken
at
the
first
parry
.
Killed
*NL*
him
,
or
poniarded
him
,
sir
,
as
is
most
agreeable
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
that
,
''
replied
M.
de
Treville
,
in
a
somewhat
softened
*NL*
tone
.
``
The
cardinal
exaggerated
,
as
I
perceive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
pray
,
sir
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
who
,
seeing
his
captain
become
*NL*
appeased
,
ventured
to
risk
a
prayer
,
``
do
not
say
that
Athos
is
wounded
.
*NL*
He
would
be
in
despair
if
that
should
come
to
the
ears
of
the
king
;
and
*NL*
as
the
wound
is
very
serious
,
seeing
that
after
crossing
the
shoulder
it
*NL*
penetrates
into
the
chest
,
it
is
to
be
feared
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
the
tapestry
was
raised
and
a
noble
and
handsome
head
,
*NL*
but
frightfully
pale
,
appeared
under
the
fringe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos
!
''
cried
the
two
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos
!
''
repeated
M.
de
Treville
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
sent
for
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Athos
to
M.
de
Treville
,
in
a
feeble
*NL*
yet
perfectly
calm
voice
,
``
you
have
sent
for
me
,
as
my
comrades
inform
*NL*
me
,
and
I
have
hastened
to
receive
your
orders
.
I
am
here
;
what
do
you
*NL*
want
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
these
words
,
the
Musketeer
,
in
irreproachable
costume
,
belted
as
*NL*
usual
,
with
a
tolerably
firm
step
,
entered
the
cabinet
.
M.
de
Treville
,
*NL*
moved
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
by
this
proof
of
courage
,
sprang
toward
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
about
to
say
to
these
gentlemen
,
''
added
he
,
``
that
I
forbid
my
*NL*
Musketeers
to
expose
their
lives
needlessly
;
for
brave
men
are
very
dear
*NL*
to
the
king
,
and
the
king
knows
that
his
Musketeers
are
the
bravest
on
*NL*
the
earth
.
Your
hand
,
Athos
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
waiting
for
the
answer
of
the
newcomer
to
this
proof
of
*NL*
affection
,
M.
de
Treville
seized
his
right
hand
and
pressed
it
with
all
*NL*
his
might
,
without
perceiving
that
Athos
,
whatever
might
be
his
*NL*
self-command
,
allowed
a
slight
murmur
of
pain
to
escape
him
,
and
if
*NL*
possible
,
grew
paler
than
he
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
had
remained
open
,
so
strong
was
the
excitement
produced
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
Athos
,
whose
wound
,
though
kept
as
a
secret
,
was
known
to
*NL*
all
.
A
burst
of
satisfaction
hailed
the
last
words
of
the
captain
;
and
*NL*
two
or
three
heads
,
carried
away
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
,
*NL*
appeared
through
the
openings
of
the
tapestry
.
M.
de
Treville
was
about
*NL*
to
reprehend
this
breach
of
the
rules
of
etiquette
,
when
he
felt
the
*NL*
hand
of
Athos
,
who
had
rallied
all
his
energies
to
contend
against
pain
,
*NL*
at
length
overcome
by
it
,
fell
upon
the
floor
as
if
he
were
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
surgeon
!
''
cried
M.
de
Treville
,
``
mine
!
The
king
's
!
The
best
!
A
*NL*
surgeon
!
Or
,
s
`
blood
,
my
brave
Athos
will
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
cries
of
M.
de
Treville
,
the
whole
assemblage
rushed
into
the
*NL*
cabinet
,
he
not
thinking
to
shut
the
door
against
anyone
,
and
all
*NL*
crowded
round
the
wounded
man
.
But
all
this
eager
attention
might
have
*NL*
been
useless
if
the
doctor
so
loudly
called
for
had
not
chanced
to
be
in
*NL*
the
hotel
.
He
pushed
through
the
crowd
,
approached
Athos
,
still
*NL*
insensible
,
and
as
all
this
noise
and
commotion
inconvenienced
him
*NL*
greatly
,
he
required
,
as
the
first
and
most
urgent
thing
,
that
the
*NL*
Musketeer
should
be
carried
into
an
adjoining
chamber
.
Immediately
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
opened
and
pointed
the
way
to
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
who
bore
*NL*
their
comrade
in
their
arms
.
Behind
this
group
walked
the
surgeon
;
and
*NL*
behind
the
surgeon
the
door
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabinet
of
M.
de
Treville
,
generally
held
so
sacred
,
became
in
an
*NL*
instant
the
annex
of
the
antechamber
.
Everyone
spoke
,
harangued
,
and
*NL*
vociferated
,
swearing
,
cursing
,
and
consigning
the
cardinal
and
his
*NL*
Guards
to
all
the
devils
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
after
,
Porthos
and
Aramis
re-entered
,
the
surgeon
and
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
alone
remaining
with
the
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
M.
de
Treville
himself
returned
.
The
injured
man
had
*NL*
recovered
his
senses
.
The
surgeon
declared
that
the
situation
of
the
*NL*
Musketeer
had
nothing
in
it
to
render
his
friends
uneasy
,
his
weakness
*NL*
having
been
purely
and
simply
caused
by
loss
of
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
M.
de
Treville
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
,
and
all
retired
except
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
did
not
forget
that
he
had
an
audience
,
and
with
the
*NL*
tenacity
of
a
Gascon
remained
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
had
gone
out
and
the
door
was
closed
,
M.
de
Treville
,
on
*NL*
turning
round
,
found
himself
alone
with
the
young
man
.
The
event
which
*NL*
had
occurred
had
in
some
degree
broken
the
thread
of
his
ideas
.
He
*NL*
inquired
what
was
the
will
of
his
persevering
visitor
.
D'Artagnan
then
*NL*
repeated
his
name
,
and
in
an
instant
recovering
all
his
remembrances
of
*NL*
the
present
and
the
past
,
M.
de
Treville
grasped
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
he
,
smiling
,
``
pardon
me
my
dear
compatriot
,
but
I
had
*NL*
wholly
forgotten
you
.
But
what
help
is
there
for
it
!
A
captain
is
*NL*
nothing
but
a
father
of
a
family
,
charged
with
even
a
greater
*NL*
responsibility
than
the
father
of
an
ordinary
family
.
Soldiers
are
big
*NL*
children
;
but
as
I
maintain
that
the
orders
of
the
king
,
and
more
*NL*
particularly
the
orders
of
the
cardinal
,
should
be
executed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
could
not
restrain
a
smile
.
By
this
smile
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
judged
that
he
had
not
to
deal
with
a
fool
,
and
changing
the
*NL*
conversation
,
came
straight
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
respected
your
father
very
much
,
''
said
he
.
``
What
can
I
do
for
the
*NL*
son
?
Tell
me
quickly
;
my
time
is
not
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
on
quitting
Tarbes
and
coming
hither
,
it
*NL*
was
my
intention
to
request
of
you
,
in
remembrance
of
the
friendship
*NL*
which
you
have
not
forgotten
,
the
uniform
of
a
Musketeer
;
but
after
all
*NL*
that
I
have
seen
during
the
last
two
hours
,
I
comprehend
that
such
a
*NL*
favor
is
enormous
,
and
tremble
lest
I
should
not
merit
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
indeed
a
favor
,
young
man
,
''
replied
M.
de
Treville
,
``
but
it
may
*NL*
not
be
so
far
beyond
your
hopes
as
you
believe
,
or
rather
as
you
appear
*NL*
to
believe
.
But
his
majesty
's
decision
is
always
necessary
;
and
I
inform
*NL*
you
with
regret
that
no
one
becomes
a
Musketeer
without
the
preliminary
*NL*
ordeal
of
several
campaigns
,
certain
brilliant
actions
,
or
a
service
of
*NL*
two
years
in
some
other
regiment
less
favored
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
bowed
without
replying
,
feeling
his
desire
to
don
the
*NL*
Musketeer
's
uniform
vastly
increased
by
the
great
difficulties
which
*NL*
preceded
the
attainment
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
continued
M.
de
Treville
,
fixing
upon
his
compatriot
a
look
so
*NL*
piercing
that
it
might
be
said
he
wished
to
read
the
thoughts
of
his
*NL*
heart
,
``
on
account
of
my
old
companion
,
your
father
,
as
I
have
said
,
I
*NL*
will
do
something
for
you
,
young
man
.
Our
recruits
from
Bearn
are
not
*NL*
generally
very
rich
,
and
I
have
no
reason
to
think
matters
have
much
*NL*
changed
in
this
respect
since
I
left
the
province
.
I
dare
say
you
have
*NL*
not
brought
too
large
a
stock
of
money
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
drew
himself
up
with
a
proud
air
which
plainly
said
,
``
I
ask
*NL*
alms
of
no
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
very
well
,
young
man
,
''
continued
M.
de
Treville
,
``
that
's
all
*NL*
very
well
.
I
know
these
airs
;
I
myself
came
to
Paris
with
four
crowns
in
*NL*
my
purse
,
and
would
have
fought
with
anyone
who
dared
to
tell
me
I
was
*NL*
not
in
a
condition
to
purchase
the
Louvre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
's
bearing
became
still
more
imposing
.
Thanks
to
the
sale
of
*NL*
his
horse
,
he
commenced
his
career
with
four
more
crowns
than
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
possessed
at
the
commencement
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
,
I
say
,
then
,
to
husband
the
means
you
have
,
however
large
*NL*
the
sum
may
be
;
but
you
ought
also
to
endeavor
to
perfect
yourself
in
*NL*
the
exercises
becoming
a
gentleman
.
I
will
write
a
letter
today
to
the
*NL*
Director
of
the
Royal
Academy
,
and
tomorrow
he
will
admit
you
without
*NL*
any
expense
to
yourself
.
Do
not
refuse
this
little
service
.
Our
*NL*
best-born
and
richest
gentlemen
sometimes
solicit
it
without
being
able
*NL*
to
obtain
it
.
You
will
learn
horsemanship
,
swordsmanship
in
all
its
*NL*
branches
,
and
dancing
.
You
will
make
some
desirable
acquaintances
;
and
*NL*
from
time
to
time
you
can
call
upon
me
,
just
to
tell
me
how
you
are
*NL*
getting
on
,
and
to
say
whether
I
can
be
of
further
service
to
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
stranger
as
he
was
to
all
the
manners
of
a
court
,
could
not
*NL*
but
perceive
a
little
coldness
in
this
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
can
not
but
perceive
how
sadly
I
miss
the
letter
*NL*
of
introduction
which
my
father
gave
me
to
present
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
am
surprised
,
''
replied
M.
de
Treville
,
``
that
you
should
*NL*
undertake
so
long
a
journey
without
that
necessary
passport
,
the
sole
*NL*
resource
of
us
poor
Bearnese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
one
,
sir
,
and
,
thank
God
,
such
as
I
could
wish
,
''
cried
*NL*
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
it
was
perfidiously
stolen
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
related
the
adventure
of
Meung
,
described
the
unknown
gentleman
*NL*
with
the
greatest
minuteness
,
and
all
with
a
warmth
and
truthfulness
*NL*
that
delighted
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
very
strange
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
,
after
meditating
a
*NL*
minute
;
``
you
mentioned
my
name
,
then
,
aloud
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
certainly
committed
that
imprudence
;
but
why
should
I
have
*NL*
done
otherwise
?
A
name
like
yours
must
be
as
a
buckler
to
me
on
my
way
.
*NL*
Judge
if
I
should
not
put
myself
under
its
protection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Flattery
was
at
that
period
very
current
,
and
M.
de
Treville
loved
*NL*
incense
as
well
as
a
king
,
or
even
a
cardinal
.
He
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
a
smile
of
visible
satisfaction
;
but
this
smile
soon
disappeared
,
and
*NL*
returning
to
the
adventure
of
Meung
,
``
Tell
me
,
''
continued
he
,
``
had
not
*NL*
this
gentlemen
a
slight
scar
on
his
cheek
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
such
a
one
as
would
be
made
by
the
grazing
of
a
ball

*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
not
a
fine-looking
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
lofty
stature

Of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

that
is

is
it

that
you
are
acquainted

man

If
I
ever
find
him
again

I
will
find
him
,
I
swear
,
were
it
in
*NL*
hell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
waiting
for
a
woman
,
''
continued
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
departed
immediately
after
having
conversed
for
a
minute
with
her
*NL*
whom
he
awaited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
not
the
subject
of
their
conversation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
gave
her
a
box

told
her
not
to
open
it
except
in
London

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
this
woman
English
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
called
her
Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

he

be

murmured
Treville
.
``
I
believed
him
still
at

Brussels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
if
you
know
who
this
man
is

''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
tell
me
who
*NL*
he
is

and
whence
he
is

I
will
then
release
you
from
all
your
*NL*
promises
--
even
that
of
procuring
my
admission
into
the
Musketeers
;
for
*NL*
before
everything
,
I
wish
to
avenge
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
,
young
man
!
''
cried
Treville
.
``
If
you
see
him
coming
on
one
side
*NL*
of
the
street
,
pass
by
on
the
other

Do
not
cast
yourself
against
such
a
*NL*
rock
;
he
would
break
you
like
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
not
prevent
me
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
if
ever
I
find
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meantime
,
''
said
Treville
,
``
seek
him
not

if
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
advise
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
captain
stopped
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
suspicion
.
*NL*
This
great
hatred
which
the
young
traveler
manifested
so
loudly
for
this
*NL*
man
,
who
--
a
rather
improbable
thing
--
had
stolen
his
father
's
letter
from
*NL*
him
--
was
there
not
some
perfidy
concealed
under
this
hatred
?
Might
not
*NL*
this
young
man
be
sent
by
his
Eminence
?
Might
he
not
have
come
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
laying
a
snare
for
him
?
This
pretended
d'Artagnan
--
was
he
not
*NL*
an
emissary
of
the
cardinal
,
whom
the
cardinal
sought
to
introduce
into
*NL*
Treville
's
house
,
to
place
near
him
,
to
win
his
confidence
,
and
*NL*
afterward
to
ruin
him
as
had
been
done
in
a
thousand
other
instances
?
He
*NL*
fixed
his
eyes
upon
d'Artagnan
even
more
earnestly
than
before
.
He
was
*NL*
moderately
reassured
,
however
,
by
the
aspect
of
that
countenance
,
full
*NL*
of
astute
intelligence
and
affected
humility
.
``
I
know
he
is
a
Gascon
,
''
*NL*
reflected
he
,
``
but
he
may
be
one
for
the
cardinal
as
well
as
for
me
.
Let
*NL*
us
try
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
said
he
,
slowly
,
``
I
wish
,
as
the
son
of
an
ancient
*NL*
friend
--
for
I
consider
this
story
of
the
lost
letter
perfectly
true
--
I
*NL*
wish
,
I
say
,
in
order
to
repair
the
coldness
you
may
have
remarked
in
my
*NL*
reception
of
you
,
to
discover
to
you
the
secrets
of
our
policy
.
The
king
*NL*
and
the
cardinal
are
the
best
of
friends
;
their
apparent
bickerings
are
*NL*
only
feints
to
deceive
fools
.
I
am
not
willing
that
a
compatriot
,
a
*NL*
handsome
cavalier
,
a
brave
youth
,
quite
fit
to
make
his
way
,
should
*NL*
become
the
dupe
of
all
these
artifices
and
fall
into
the
snare
after
the
*NL*
example
of
so
many
others
who
have
been
ruined
by
it
.
Be
assured
that
I
*NL*
am
devoted
to
both
these
all-powerful
masters
,
and
that
my
earnest
*NL*
endeavors
have
no
other
aim
than
the
service
of
the
king
,
and
also
the
*NL*
cardinal
--
one
of
the
most
illustrious
geniuses
that
France
has
ever
*NL*
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
young
man
,
regulate
your
conduct
accordingly
;
and
if
you
*NL*
entertain
,
whether
from
your
family
,
your
relations
,
or
even
from
your
*NL*
instincts
,
any
of
these
enmities
which
we
see
constantly
breaking
out
*NL*
against
the
cardinal
,
bid
me
adieu
and
let
us
separate
.
I
will
aid
you
*NL*
in
many
ways
,
but
without
attaching
you
to
my
person
.
I
hope
that
my
*NL*
frankness
at
least
will
make
you
my
friend
;
for
you
are
the
only
young
*NL*
man
to
whom
I
have
hitherto
spoken
as
I
have
done
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Treville
said
to
himself
:
``
If
the
cardinal
has
set
this
young
fox
upon
*NL*
me
,
he
will
certainly
not
have
failed
--
he
,
who
knows
how
bitterly
I
*NL*
execrate
him
--
to
tell
his
spy
that
the
best
means
of
making
his
court
to
*NL*
me
is
to
rail
at
him
.
Therefore
,
in
spite
of
all
my
protestations
,
if
it
*NL*
be
as
I
suspect
,
my
cunning
gossip
will
assure
me
that
he
holds
his
*NL*
Eminence
in
horror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
,
however
,
proved
otherwise
.
D'Artagnan
answered
,
with
the
greatest
*NL*
simplicity
:
``
I
came
to
Paris
with
exactly
such
intentions
.
My
father
*NL*
advised
me
to
stoop
to
nobody
but
the
king
,
the
cardinal
,
and
*NL*
yourself
--
whom
he
considered
the
first
three
personages
in
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
added
M.
de
Treville
to
the
others
,
as
may
be
perceived
;
but
*NL*
he
thought
this
addition
would
do
no
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
greatest
veneration
for
the
cardinal
,
''
continued
he
,
``
and
*NL*
the
most
profound
respect
for
his
actions
.
So
much
the
better
for
me
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
you
speak
to
me
,
as
you
say
,
with
frankness
--
for
then
you
will
*NL*
do
me
the
honor
to
esteem
the
resemblance
of
our
opinions
;
but
if
you
*NL*
have
entertained
any
doubt
,
as
naturally
you
may
,
I
feel
that
I
am
*NL*
ruining
myself
by
speaking
the
truth
.
But
I
still
trust
you
will
not
*NL*
esteem
me
the
less
for
it
,
and
that
is
my
object
beyond
all
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
was
surprised
to
the
greatest
degree
.
So
much
penetration
,
*NL*
so
much
frankness
,
created
admiration
,
but
did
not
entirely
remove
his
*NL*
suspicions
.
The
more
this
young
man
was
superior
to
others
,
the
more
he
*NL*
was
to
be
dreaded
if
he
meant
to
deceive
him
.
Nevertheless
,
he
pressed
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
hand
,
and
said
to
him
:
``
You
are
an
honest
youth
;
but
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
I
can
only
do
for
you
that
which
I
just
now
offered
.
My
*NL*
hotel
will
be
always
open
to
you
.
Hereafter
,
being
able
to
ask
for
me
at
*NL*
all
hours
,
and
consequently
to
take
advantage
of
all
opportunities
,
you
*NL*
will
probably
obtain
that
which
you
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
that
you
will
wait
until
I
have
*NL*
proved
myself
worthy
of
it
.
Well
,
be
assured
,
''
added
he
,
with
the
*NL*
familiarity
of
a
Gascon
,
``
you
shall
not
wait
long
.
''
And
he
bowed
in
*NL*
order
to
retire
,
and
as
if
he
considered
the
future
in
his
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wait
a
minute
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
,
stopping
him
.
``
I
promised
you
*NL*
a
letter
for
the
director
of
the
Academy
.
Are
you
too
proud
to
accept
*NL*
it
,
young
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
I
will
guard
it
so
carefully
that
I
*NL*
will
be
sworn
it
shall
arrive
at
its
address
,
and
woe
be
to
him
who
*NL*
shall
attempt
to
take
it
from
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
smiled
at
this
flourish
;
and
leaving
his
young
man
*NL*
compatriot
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
,
where
they
had
talked
*NL*
together
,
he
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
order
to
write
the
promised
*NL*
letter
of
recommendation
.
While
he
was
doing
this
,
d'Artagnan
,
having
no
*NL*
better
employment
,
amused
himself
with
beating
a
march
upon
the
window
*NL*
and
with
looking
at
the
Musketeers
,
who
went
away
,
one
after
another
,
*NL*
following
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
,
after
having
written
the
letter
,
sealed
it
,
and
rising
,
*NL*
approached
the
young
man
in
order
to
give
it
to
him
.
But
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
d'Artagnan
stretched
out
his
hand
to
receive
it
,
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
was
highly
astonished
to
see
his
protege
make
a
sudden
spring
,
*NL*
become
crimson
with
passion
,
and
rush
from
the
cabinet
crying
,
``
S'blood
,
*NL*
he
shall
not
escape
me
this
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
?
''
asked
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
,
my
thief
!
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
Ah
,
the
traitor
!
''
and
he
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
take
the
madman
!
''
murmured
M.
de
Treville
,
``
unless
,
''
added
*NL*
he
,
``
this
is
a
cunning
mode
of
escaping
,
seeing
that
he
had
failed
in
*NL*
his
purpose

*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
in
a
state
of
fury
,
crossed
the
antechamber
at
three
bounds
,
*NL*
and
was
darting
toward
the
stairs
,
which
he
reckoned
upon
descending
*NL*
four
at
a
time
,
when
,
in
his
heedless
course
,
he
ran
head
foremost
*NL*
against
a
Musketeer
who
was
coming
out
of
one
of
M.
de
Treville
's
*NL*
private
rooms
,
and
striking
his
shoulder
violently
,
made
him
utter
a
*NL*
cry
,
or
rather
a
howl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
endeavoring
to
resume
his
course
,
``
excuse
*NL*
me
,
but
I
am
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
he
descended
the
first
stair
,
when
a
hand
of
iron
seized
*NL*
him
by
the
belt
and
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
a
hurry
?
''
said
the
Musketeer
,
as
pale
as
a
sheet
.
``
Under
*NL*
that
pretense
you
run
against
me
!
You
say
,
`
Excuse
me
,
'
and
you
believe
*NL*
that
is
sufficient
?
Not
at
all
,
my
young
man
.
Do
you
fancy
because
you
*NL*
have
heard
Monsieur
de
Treville
speak
to
us
a
little
cavalierly
today
*NL*
that
other
people
are
to
treat
us
as
he
speaks
to
us

Undeceive
*NL*
yourself

comrade
,
you
are
not
Monsieur
de
Treville

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith

''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
recognizing
Athos
,
who
,
after
the
*NL*
dressing
performed
by
the
doctor
,
was
returning
to
his
own
apartment
.
``
I
*NL*
did
not
do
it
intentionally

It
appears
to
me
that
this
is
quite
enough
.
I
repeat
to
*NL*
you
,
however
,
and
this
time
on
my
word
of
honor
--
I
think
perhaps
too
*NL*
often
--
that
I
am
in
haste
,
great
haste
.
Leave
your
hold
,
then
,
I
beg
of
*NL*
you
,
and
let
me
go
where
my
business
calls
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Athos
,
letting
him
go
,
``
you
are
not
polite
;
it
is
easy
*NL*
to
perceive
that
you
come
from
a
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
already
strode
down
three
or
four
stairs
,
but
at
Athos
's
*NL*
last
remark
he
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MORBLEU
,
monsieur
!
''
said
he
,
``
however
far
I
may
come
,
it
is
not
you
who
*NL*
can
give
me
a
lesson
in
good
manners
,
I
warn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
If
I
were
not
in
such
haste
,
and
if
I
were
not
running
after
*NL*
someone
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Man-in-a-hurry
,
you
can
find
me
without
running
--
ME
,
you
*NL*
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
,
I
pray
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
the
Carmes-Deschaux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
noon
?
That
will
do
;
I
will
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Endeavor
not
to
make
me
wait
;
for
at
quarter
past
twelve
I
will
cut
off
*NL*
your
ears
as
you
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
will
be
there
ten
minutes
before
twelve
.
''
*NL*
And
he
set
off
running
as
if
the
devil
possessed
him
,
hoping
that
he
*NL*
might
yet
find
the
stranger
,
whose
slow
pace
could
not
have
carried
him
*NL*
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
street
gate
,
Porthos
was
talking
with
the
soldier
on
guard
.
*NL*
Between
the
two
talkers
there
was
just
enough
room
for
a
man
to
pass
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
thought
it
would
suffice
for
him
,
and
he
sprang
forward
like
*NL*
a
dart
between
them
.
But
d'Artagnan
had
reckoned
without
the
wind
.
As
he
*NL*
was
about
to
pass
,
the
wind
blew
out
Porthos
's
long
cloak
,
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
rushed
straight
into
the
middle
of
it
.
Without
doubt
,
Porthos
*NL*
had
reasons
for
not
abandoning
this
part
of
his
vestments
,
for
instead
*NL*
of
quitting
his
hold
on
the
flap
in
his
hand
,
he
pulled
it
toward
him
,
*NL*
so
that
d'Artagnan
rolled
himself
up
in
the
velvet
by
a
movement
of
*NL*
rotation
explained
by
the
persistency
of
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
hearing
the
Musketeer
swear
,
wished
to
escape
from
the
*NL*
cloak
,
which
blinded
him
,
and
sought
to
find
his
way
from
under
the
*NL*
folds
of
it
.
He
was
particularly
anxious
to
avoid
marring
the
freshness
*NL*
of
the
magnificent
baldric
we
are
acquainted
with
;
but
on
timidly
*NL*
opening
his
eyes
,
he
found
himself
with
his
nose
fixed
between
the
two
*NL*
shoulders
of
Porthos
--
that
is
to
say
,
exactly
upon
the
baldric
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
like
most
things
in
this
world
which
have
nothing
in
their
favor
*NL*
but
appearances
,
the
baldric
was
glittering
with
gold
in
the
front
,
but
*NL*
was
nothing
but
simple
buff
behind
.
Vainglorious
as
he
was
,
Porthos
*NL*
could
not
afford
to
have
a
baldric
wholly
of
gold
,
but
had
at
least
*NL*
half
.
One
could
comprehend
the
necessity
of
the
cold
and
the
urgency
of
*NL*
the
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
''
cried
Porthos
,
making
strong
efforts
to
disembarrass
himself
*NL*
of
d'Artagnan
,
who
was
wriggling
about
his
back
;
``
you
must
be
mad
to
run
*NL*
against
people
in
this
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
reappearing
under
the
shoulder
of
the
*NL*
giant
,
``
but
I
am
in
such
haste
--
I
was
running
after
someone
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
always
forget
your
eyes
when
you
run
?
''
asked
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
piqued
,
``
and
thanks
to
my
eyes
,
I
can
see
what
*NL*
other
people
can
not
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Porthos
understood
him
or
did
not
understand
him
,
giving
way
to
*NL*
his
anger
,
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
stand
a
chance
of
getting
chastised
*NL*
if
you
rub
Musketeers
in
this
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chastised
,
Monsieur
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
the
expression
is
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
one
that
becomes
a
man
accustomed
to
look
his
enemies
in
the
*NL*
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
PARDIEU
!
I
know
full
well
that
you
do
n't
turn
your
back
to
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
young
man
,
delighted
with
his
joke
,
went
away
laughing
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
foamed
with
rage
,
and
made
a
movement
to
rush
after
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
,
presently
,
''
cried
the
latter
,
``
when
you
have
n't
your
cloak
*NL*
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
one
o'clock
,
then
,
behind
the
Luxembourg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
at
one
o'clock
,
then
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
turning
the
angle
*NL*
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
in
the
street
he
had
passed
through
,
nor
in
the
one
which
*NL*
his
eager
glance
pervaded
,
could
he
see
anyone
;
however
slowly
the
*NL*
stranger
had
walked
,
he
was
gone
on
his
way
,
or
perhaps
had
entered
some
*NL*
house
.
D'Artagnan
inquired
of
everyone
he
met
with
,
went
down
to
the
*NL*
ferry
,
came
up
again
by
the
Rue
de
Seine
,
and
the
Red
Cross
;
but
*NL*
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
!
This
chase
was
,
however
,
advantageous
to
*NL*
him
in
one
sense
,
for
in
proportion
as
the
perspiration
broke
from
his
*NL*
forehead
,
his
heart
began
to
cool
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
reflect
upon
the
events
that
had
passed
;
they
were
numerous
*NL*
and
inauspicious
.
It
was
scarcely
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
yet
*NL*
this
morning
had
already
brought
him
into
disgrace
with
M.
de
Treville
,
*NL*
who
could
not
fail
to
think
the
manner
in
which
d'Artagnan
had
left
him
*NL*
a
little
cavalier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
he
had
drawn
upon
himself
two
good
duels
with
two
men
,
*NL*
each
capable
of
killing
three
d'Artagnans
--
with
two
Musketeers
,
in
*NL*
short
,
with
two
of
those
beings
whom
he
esteemed
so
greatly
that
he
*NL*
placed
them
in
his
mind
and
heart
above
all
other
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
outlook
was
sad
.
Sure
of
being
killed
by
Athos
,
it
may
easily
be
*NL*
understood
that
the
young
man
was
not
very
uneasy
about
Porthos
.
As
*NL*
hope
,
however
,
is
the
last
thing
extinguished
in
the
heart
of
man
,
he
*NL*
finished
by
hoping
that
he
might
survive
,
even
though
with
terrible
*NL*
wounds
,
in
both
these
duels
;
and
in
case
of
surviving
,
he
made
the
*NL*
following
reprehensions
upon
his
own
conduct
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
madcap
I
was
,
and
what
a
stupid
fellow
I
am
!
That
brave
and
*NL*
unfortunate
Athos
was
wounded
on
that
very
shoulder
against
which
I
must
*NL*
run
head
foremost
,
like
a
ram
.
The
only
thing
that
astonishes
me
is
that
*NL*
he
did
not
strike
me
dead
at
once
.
He
had
good
cause
to
do
so
;
the
pain
*NL*
I
gave
him
must
have
been
atrocious
.
As
to
Porthos
--
oh
,
as
to
Porthos
,
*NL*
faith
,
that
's
a
droll
affair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
spite
of
himself
,
the
young
man
began
to
laugh
aloud
,
looking
*NL*
round
carefully
,
however
,
to
see
that
his
solitary
laugh
,
without
a
*NL*
cause
in
the
eyes
of
passers-by
,
offended
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
Porthos
,
that
is
certainly
droll
;
but
I
am
not
the
less
a
giddy
*NL*
fool
.
Are
people
to
be
run
against
without
warning
?
No
!
And
have
I
any
*NL*
right
to
go
and
peep
under
their
cloaks
to
see
what
is
not
there
?
He
*NL*
would
have
pardoned
me
,
he
would
certainly
have
pardoned
me
,
if
I
had
*NL*
not
said
anything
to
him
about
that
cursed
baldric
--
in
ambiguous
words
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
but
rather
drolly
ambiguous
.
Ah
,
cursed
Gascon
that
I
am
,
I
*NL*
get
from
one
hobble
into
another
.
Friend
d'Artagnan
,
''
continued
he
,
*NL*
speaking
to
himself
with
all
the
amenity
that
he
thought
due
himself
,
*NL*
``
if
you
escape
,
of
which
there
is
not
much
chance
,
I
would
advise
you
to
*NL*
practice
perfect
politeness
for
the
future
.
You
must
henceforth
be
*NL*
admired
and
quoted
as
a
model
of
it
.
To
be
obliging
and
polite
does
not
*NL*
necessarily
make
a
man
a
coward
.
Look
at
Aramis
,
now
;
Aramis
is
mildness
*NL*
and
grace
personified
.
Well
,
did
anybody
ever
dream
of
calling
Aramis
a
*NL*
coward
?
No
,
certainly
not
,
and
from
this
moment
I
will
endeavor
to
model
*NL*
myself
after
him
.
Ah
!
That
's
strange
!
Here
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
walking
and
soliloquizing
,
had
arrived
within
a
few
steps
of
*NL*
the
hotel
d'Arguillon
and
in
front
of
that
hotel
perceived
Aramis
,
*NL*
chatting
gaily
with
three
gentlemen
;
but
as
he
had
not
forgotten
that
it
*NL*
was
in
presence
of
this
young
man
that
M.
de
Treville
had
been
so
angry
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
as
a
witness
of
the
rebuke
the
Musketeers
had
*NL*
received
was
not
likely
to
be
at
all
agreeable
,
he
pretended
not
to
see
*NL*
him
.
D'Artagnan
,
on
the
contrary
,
quite
full
of
his
plans
of
*NL*
conciliation
and
courtesy
,
approached
the
young
men
with
a
profound
bow
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
most
gracious
smile
.
All
four
,
besides
,
immediately
*NL*
broke
off
their
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
not
so
dull
as
not
to
perceive
that
he
was
one
too
many
;
*NL*
but
he
was
not
sufficiently
broken
into
the
fashions
of
the
gay
world
to
*NL*
know
how
to
extricate
himself
gallantly
from
a
false
position
,
like
that
*NL*
of
a
man
who
begins
to
mingle
with
people
he
is
scarcely
acquainted
with
*NL*
and
in
a
conversation
that
does
not
concern
him
.
He
was
seeking
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
then
,
for
the
least
awkward
means
of
retreat
,
when
he
remarked
*NL*
that
Aramis
had
let
his
handkerchief
fall
,
and
by
mistake
,
no
doubt
,
had
*NL*
placed
his
foot
upon
it
.
This
appeared
to
be
a
favorable
opportunity
to
*NL*
repair
his
intrusion
.
He
stooped
,
and
with
the
most
gracious
air
he
*NL*
could
assume
,
drew
the
handkerchief
from
under
the
foot
of
the
Musketeer
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
efforts
the
latter
made
to
detain
it
,
and
holding
it
out
*NL*
to
him
,
said
,
``
I
believe
,
monsieur
,
that
this
is
a
handkerchief
you
*NL*
would
be
sorry
to
lose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
handkerchief
was
indeed
richly
embroidered
,
and
had
a
coronet
and
*NL*
arms
at
one
of
its
corners
.
Aramis
blushed
excessively
,
and
snatched
*NL*
rather
than
took
the
handkerchief
from
the
hand
of
the
Gascon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
cried
one
of
the
Guards
,
``
will
you
persist
in
saying
,
most
*NL*
discreet
Aramis
,
that
you
are
not
on
good
terms
with
Madame
de
*NL*
Bois-Tracy
,
when
that
gracious
lady
has
the
kindness
to
lend
you
one
of
*NL*
her
handkerchiefs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
darted
at
d'Artagnan
one
of
those
looks
which
inform
a
man
that
*NL*
he
has
acquired
a
mortal
enemy
.
Then
,
resuming
his
mild
air
,
``
You
are
*NL*
deceived
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
handkerchief
is
not
mine
,
and
I
*NL*
can
not
fancy
why
Monsieur
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
offer
it
to
me
*NL*
rather
than
to
one
of
you
;
and
as
a
proof
of
what
I
say
,
here
is
mine
in
*NL*
my
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
pulled
out
his
own
handkerchief
,
likewise
a
very
elegant
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
of
fine
cambric
--
though
cambric
was
dear
at
the
*NL*
period
--
but
a
handkerchief
without
embroidery
and
without
arms
,
only
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
single
cipher
,
that
of
its
proprietor
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
d'Artagnan
was
not
hasty
.
He
perceived
his
mistake
;
but
the
*NL*
friends
of
Aramis
were
not
at
all
convinced
by
his
denial
,
and
one
of
*NL*
them
addressed
the
young
Musketeer
with
affected
seriousness
.
``
If
it
*NL*
were
as
you
pretend
it
is
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
should
be
forced
,
my
dear
*NL*
Aramis
,
to
reclaim
it
myself
;
for
,
as
you
very
well
know
,
Bois-Tracy
is
*NL*
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
,
and
I
can
not
allow
the
property
of
his
wife
*NL*
to
be
sported
as
a
trophy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
the
demand
badly
,
''
replied
Aramis
;
``
and
while
acknowledging
*NL*
the
justice
of
your
reclamation
,
I
refuse
it
on
account
of
the
form
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
''
hazarded
d'Artagnan
,
timidly
,
``
I
did
not
see
the
*NL*
handkerchief
fall
from
the
pocket
of
Monsieur
Aramis
.
He
had
his
foot
*NL*
upon
it
,
that
is
all
;
and
I
thought
from
having
his
foot
upon
it
the
*NL*
handkerchief
was
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
were
deceived
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
replied
Aramis
,
coldly
,
very
*NL*
little
sensible
to
the
reparation
.
Then
turning
toward
that
one
of
the
*NL*
guards
who
had
declared
himself
the
friend
of
Bois-Tracy
,
``
Besides
,
''
*NL*
continued
he
,
``
I
have
reflected
,
my
dear
intimate
of
Bois-Tracy
,
that
I
*NL*
am
not
less
tenderly
his
friend
than
you
can
possibly
be
;
so
that
*NL*
decidedly
this
handkerchief
is
as
likely
to
have
fallen
from
your
pocket
*NL*
as
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
upon
my
honor
!
''
cried
his
Majesty
's
Guardsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
about
to
swear
upon
your
honor
and
I
upon
my
word
,
and
then
it
*NL*
will
be
pretty
evident
that
one
of
us
will
have
lied
.
Now
,
here
,
*NL*
Montaran
,
we
will
do
better
than
that
--
let
each
take
a
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
handkerchief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
just
,
''
cried
the
other
two
Guardsmen
,
``
the
judgment
of
King
*NL*
Solomon
!
Aramis
,
you
certainly
are
full
of
wisdom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
as
may
be
supposed
,
the
affair
had
*NL*
no
other
sequel
.
In
a
moment
or
two
the
conversation
ceased
,
and
the
*NL*
three
Guardsmen
and
the
Musketeer
,
after
having
cordially
shaken
hands
,
*NL*
separated
,
the
Guardsmen
going
one
way
and
Aramis
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
is
my
time
to
make
peace
with
this
gallant
man
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
*NL*
himself
,
having
stood
on
one
side
during
the
whole
of
the
latter
part
of
*NL*
the
conversation
;
and
with
this
good
feeling
drawing
near
to
Aramis
,
who
*NL*
was
departing
without
paying
any
attention
to
him
,
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
you
will
excuse
me
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

monsieur

interrupted
Aramis
,
``
permit
me
to
observe
to
you

*NL*

cried
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*

I
suppose

coming
from

*NL*
``
Monsieur

you
act
wrongly

endeavoring

mortify

said
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
in
whom
the
natural
quarrelsome
spirit
began
to
speak
more
*NL*
loudly
than
his
pacific
resolutions
.
``
I
am
from

you
know

there

no

*NL*

led

THE
KING
'S
MUSKETEERS
AND
THE
CARDINAL
'S
GUARDS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
acquainted
with
nobody
in
Paris
.
He
went
therefore
to
his
*NL*
appointment
with
Athos
without
a
second
,
determined
to
be
satisfied
with
*NL*
those
his
adversary
should
choose
.
Besides
,
his
intention
was
formed
to
*NL*
make
the
brave
Musketeer
all
suitable
apologies
,
but
without
meanness
or
*NL*
weakness
,
fearing
that
might
result
from
this
duel
which
generally
*NL*
results
from
an
affair
of
this
kind
,
when
a
young
and
vigorous
man
*NL*
fights
with
an
adversary
who
is
wounded
and
weakened
--
if
conquered
,
he
*NL*
doubles
the
triumph
of
his
antagonist
;
if
a
conqueror
,
he
is
accused
of
*NL*
foul
play
and
want
of
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
we
must
have
badly
painted
the
character
of
our
adventure
seeker
,
*NL*
or
our
readers
must
have
already
perceived
that
d'Artagnan
was
not
an
*NL*
ordinary
man
;
therefore
,
while
repeating
to
himself
that
his
death
was
*NL*
inevitable
,
he
did
not
make
up
his
mind
to
die
quietly
,
as
one
less
*NL*
courageous
and
less
restrained
might
have
done
in
his
place
.
He
*NL*
reflected
upon
the
different
characters
of
those
with
whom
he
was
going
*NL*
to
fight
,
and
began
to
view
his
situation
more
clearly
.
He
hoped
,
by
*NL*
means
of
loyal
excuses
,
to
make
a
friend
of
Athos
,
whose
lordly
air
and
*NL*
austere
bearing
pleased
him
much
.
He
flattered
himself
he
should
be
able
*NL*
to
frighten
Porthos
with
the
adventure
of
the
baldric
,
which
he
might
,
*NL*
if
not
killed
upon
the
spot
,
relate
to
everybody
a
recital
which
,
well
*NL*
managed
,
would
cover
Porthos
with
ridicule
.
As
to
the
astute
Aramis
,
he
*NL*
did
not
entertain
much
dread
of
him
;
and
supposing
he
should
be
able
to
*NL*
get
so
far
,
he
determined
to
dispatch
him
in
good
style
or
at
least
,
by
*NL*
hitting
him
in
the
face
,
as
Caesar
recommended
his
soldiers
do
to
those
*NL*
of
Pompey
,
to
damage
forever
the
beauty
of
which
he
was
so
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
,
d'Artagnan
possessed
that
invincible
stock
of
*NL*
resolution
which
the
counsels
of
his
father
had
implanted
in
his
heart
:
*NL*
``
Endure
nothing
from
anyone
but
the
king
,
the
cardinal
,
and
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
.
''
He
flew
,
then
,
rather
than
walked
,
toward
the
convent
of
the
*NL*
Carmes
Dechausses
,
or
rather
Deschaux
,
as
it
was
called
at
that
period
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
building
without
a
window
,
surrounded
by
barren
fields
--
an
*NL*
accessory
to
the
Preaux-Clercs
,
and
which
was
generally
employed
as
the
*NL*
place
for
the
duels
of
men
who
had
no
time
to
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
d'Artagnan
arrived
in
sight
of
the
bare
spot
of
ground
which
*NL*
extended
along
the
foot
of
the
monastery
,
Athos
had
been
waiting
about
*NL*
five
minutes
,
and
twelve
o'clock
was
striking
.
He
was
,
then
,
as
punctual
*NL*
as
the
Samaritan
woman
,
and
the
most
rigorous
casuist
with
regard
to
*NL*
duels
could
have
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
who
still
suffered
grievously
from
his
wound
,
though
it
had
been
*NL*
dressed
anew
by
M.
de
Treville
's
surgeon
,
was
seated
on
a
post
and
*NL*
waiting
for
his
adversary
with
hat
in
hand
,
his
feather
even
touching
*NL*
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
I
have
engaged
two
of
my
friends
as
seconds
;
*NL*
but
these
two
friends
are
not
yet
come
,
at
which
I
am
astonished
,
as
it
*NL*
is
not
at
all
their
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
seconds
on
my
part
,
monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
for
having
*NL*
only
arrived
yesterday
in
Paris
,
I
as
yet
know
no
one
but
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
,
to
whom
I
was
recommended
by
my
father
,
who
has
the
honor
to
*NL*
be
,
in
some
degree
,
one
of
his
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
reflected
for
an
instant
.
``
You
know
no
one
but
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
I
know
only
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
then
,
''
continued
Athos
,
speaking
half
to
himself
,
``
if
I
kill
*NL*
you
,
I
shall
have
the
air
of
a
boy-slayer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
too
much
so
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
with
a
bow
that
was
not
deficient
*NL*
in
dignity
,
``
since
you
do
me
the
honor
to
draw
a
sword
with
me
while
*NL*
suffering
from
a
wound
which
is
very
inconvenient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
inconvenient
,
upon
my
word
;
and
you
hurt
me
devilishly
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
.
But
I
will
take
the
left
hand
--
it
is
my
custom
in
such
*NL*
circumstances
.
Do
not
fancy
that
I
do
you
a
favor
;
I
use
either
hand
*NL*
easily
.
And
it
will
be
even
a
disadvantage
to
you
;
a
left-handed
man
is
*NL*
very
troublesome
to
people
who
are
not
prepared
for
it
.
I
regret
I
did
*NL*
not
inform
you
sooner
of
this
circumstance
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
truly
,
monsieur

said
d'Artagnan
,
bowing
again
,
``
a
courtesy
,
*NL*
for
which
,
I
assure
you
,
I
am
very
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
confuse
me
,
''
replied
Athos
,
with
his
gentlemanly
air
;
``
let
us
talk
*NL*
of
something
else
,
if
you
please
.
Ah
,
s
`
blood
,
how
you
have
hurt
me
!
My
*NL*
shoulder
quite
burns

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
permit
me
--
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
with
timidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
miraculous
balsam
for
wounds
--
a
balsam
given
to
me
by
my
*NL*
mother
and
of
which
I
have
made
a
trial
upon
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
sure
that
in
less
than
three
days
this
balsam
would
cure
*NL*
you
;
and
at
the
end
of
three
days
,
when
you
would
be
cured
--
well
,
sir
,
*NL*
it
would
still
do
me
a
great
honor
to
be
your
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
spoke
these
words
with
a
simplicity
that
did
honor
to
his
*NL*
courtesy
,
without
throwing
the
least
doubt
upon
his
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARDIEU
,
monsieur
!
''
said
Athos
,
``
that
's
a
proposition
that
pleases
me
;
*NL*
not
that
I
can
accept
it
,
but
a
league
off
it
savors
of
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
Thus
spoke
and
acted
the
gallant
knights
of
the
time
of
Charlemagne
,
in
*NL*
whom
every
cavalier
ought
to
seek
his
model
.
Unfortunately
,
we
do
not
*NL*
live
in
the
times

great
emperor

we
live
in

times

three
days
hence

however
well
the
secret
might
be

guarded

it
would
be
known

I
say
,
that
we
were
to
fight

our
combat

would
be
prevented

I
think
these
fellows
will
never
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
in
haste

said
d'Artagnan
,
with
the
same
*NL*
simplicity
with
which
a
moment
before
he
had
proposed
to
him
to
put
off
*NL*
the
duel
for
three
days
,
``
and
if
it
be
your
will
to
dispatch
me
at
once

*NL*
do
not
inconvenience
yourself

I
pray
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
another
word

pleases
me

cried
Athos
,
with
a
gracious
*NL*
nod
to
d'Artagnan
.
``
That
did
not
come
from
a
man
without
a
heart
.
*NL*
Monsieur
,
I
love
men
of
your
kidney
;
and
I
foresee
plainly
that
if
we
*NL*
do
n't
kill
each
other
,
I
shall
hereafter
have
much
pleasure
in
your
*NL*
conversation
.
We
will
wait
for
these
gentlemen
,
so
please
you
;
I
have
*NL*
plenty
of
time
,
and
it
will
be
more
correct
.
Ah
,
here
is
one
of
them
,
I
*NL*
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
at
the
end
of
the
Rue
Vaugirard
the
gigantic
Porthos
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
is
your
first
witness
Monsieur
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
disturbs
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
the
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
turned
in
the
direction
pointed
to
by
Athos
,
and
perceived
*NL*
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
he
,
in
an
accent
of
greater
astonishment
than
before
,
*NL*
``
your
second
witness
is
Monsieur
Aramis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
!
Are
you
not
aware
that
we
are
never
seen
one
without
the
*NL*
others
,
and
that
we
are
called
among
the
Musketeers
and
the
Guards
,
at
*NL*
court
and
in
the
city
,
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
,
or
the
Three
*NL*
Inseparables
?
And
yet
,
as
you
come
from
Dax
or
Pau
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Tarbes
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
probable
you
are
ignorant
of
this
little
fact
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
!
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
are
well
named
,
gentlemen
;
and
my
*NL*
adventure
,
if
it
should
make
any
noise
,
will
prove
at
least
that
your
*NL*
union
is
not
founded
upon
contrasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Porthos
had
come
up
,
waved
his
hand
to
Athos
,
and
then
*NL*
turning
toward
d'Artagnan
,
stood
quite
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
in
passing
that
he
had
changed
his
baldric
and
relinquished
*NL*
his
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
he
,
``
what
does
this
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
gentleman
I
am
going
to
fight
with
,
''
said
Athos
,
pointing
*NL*
to
d'Artagnan
with
his
hand
and
saluting
him
with
the
same
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
is
with
him
I
am
also
going
to
fight
,
''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
before
one
o'clock
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
also
am
to
fight
with
this
gentleman
,
''
said
Aramis
,
coming
in
his
*NL*
turn
onto
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
until
two
o'clock
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
with
the
same
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
going
to
fight
about
,
Athos
?
''
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
!
I
do
n't
very
well
know
.
He
hurt
my
shoulder
.
And
you
,
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
!
I
am
going
to
fight
--
because
I
am
going
to
fight
,
''
answered
*NL*
Porthos
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
whose
keen
eye
lost
nothing
,
perceived
a
faintly
sly
smile
pass
*NL*
over
the
lips
of
the
young
Gascon
as
he
replied
,
``
We
had
a
short
*NL*
discussion
upon
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Aramis
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ours
is
a
theological
quarrel
,
''
replied
Aramis
,
making
a
sign
to
*NL*
d'Artagnan
to
keep
secret
the
cause
of
their
duel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
indeed
saw
a
second
smile
on
the
lips
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
a
passage
of
St.
Augustine
,
upon
which
we
could
not
agree
,
''
said
*NL*
the
Gascon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
this
is
a
clever
fellow
,
''
murmured
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
are
assembled
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
permit
me
to
*NL*
offer
you
my
apologies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
word
APOLOGIES
,
a
cloud
passed
over
the
brow
of
Athos
,
a
haughty
*NL*
smile
curled
the
lip
of
Porthos
,
and
a
negative
sign
was
the
reply
of
*NL*
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
understand
me
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
throwing
up
his
*NL*
head
,
the
sharp
and
bold
lines
of
which
were
at
the
moment
gilded
by
a
*NL*
bright
ray
of
the
sun
.
``
I
asked
to
be
excused
in
case
I
should
not
be
*NL*
able
to
discharge
my
debt
to
all
three
;
for
Monsieur
Athos
has
the
right
*NL*
to
kill
me
first
,
which
must
much
diminish
the
face-value
of
your
bill
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Porthos
,
and
render
yours
almost
null
,
Monsieur
Aramis
.
And
*NL*
now
,
gentlemen
,
I
repeat
,
excuse
me
,
but
on
that
account
only
,
and
--
on
*NL*
guard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
with
the
most
gallant
air
possible
,
d'Artagnan
drew
his
*NL*
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
had
mounted
to
the
head
of
d'Artagnan
,
and
at
that
moment
he
*NL*
would
have
drawn
his
sword
against
all
the
Musketeers
in
the
kingdom
as
*NL*
willingly
as
he
now
did
against
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
quarter
past
midday
.
The
sun
was
in
its
zenith
,
and
the
spot
*NL*
chosen
for
the
scene
of
the
duel
was
exposed
to
its
full
ardor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
hot
,
''
said
Athos
,
drawing
his
sword
in
its
turn
,
``
and
yet
I
*NL*
can
not
take
off
my
doublet
;
for
I
just
now
felt
my
wound
begin
to
bleed
*NL*
again
,
and
I
should
not
like
to
annoy
Monsieur
with
the
sight
of
blood
*NL*
which
he
has
not
drawn
from
me
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
Monsieur
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
whether
drawn
by
*NL*
myself
or
another
,
I
assure
you
I
shall
always
view
with
regret
the
*NL*
blood
of
so
brave
a
gentleman
.
I
will
therefore
fight
in
my
doublet
,
*NL*
like
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
enough
of
such
compliments
!
''
cried
Porthos
.
``
Remember
,
we
*NL*
are
waiting
for
our
turns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
for
yourself
when
you
are
inclined
to
utter
such
incongruities
,
''
*NL*
interrupted
Aramis
.
``
For
my
part
,
I
think
what
they
say
is
very
well
*NL*
said
,
and
quite
worthy
of
two
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
please
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Athos
,
putting
himself
on
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
waited
your
orders
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
crossing
swords
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
scarcely
had
the
two
rapiers
clashed
,
when
a
company
of
the
Guards
*NL*
of
his
Eminence
,
commanded
by
M.
de
Jussac
,
turned
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cardinal
's
Guards
!
''
cried
Aramis
and
Porthos
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
``
Sheathe
your
swords
,
gentlemen
,
sheathe
your
swords
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
too
late
.
The
two
combatants
had
been
seen
in
a
position
*NL*
which
left
no
doubt
of
their
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halloo
!
''
cried
Jussac
,
advancing
toward
them
and
making
a
sign
to
his
*NL*
men
to
do
so
likewise
,
``
halloo
,
Musketeers
?
Fighting
here
,
are
you
?
And
*NL*
the
edicts
?
What
is
become
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
generous
,
gentlemen
of
the
Guards
,
''
said
Athos
,
full
of
*NL*
rancor
,
for
Jussac
was
one
of
the
aggressors
of
the
preceding
day
.
``
If
*NL*
we
were
to
see
you
fighting
,
I
can
assure
you
that
we
would
make
no
*NL*
effort
to
prevent
you
.
Leave
us
alone
,
then
,
and
you
will
enjoy
a
little
*NL*
amusement
without
cost
to
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Jussac
,
``
it
is
with
great
regret
that
I
pronounce
the
*NL*
thing
impossible
.
Duty
before
everything
.
Sheathe
,
then
,
if
you
please
,
*NL*
and
follow
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Aramis
,
parodying
Jussac
,
``
it
would
afford
us
great
*NL*
pleasure
to
obey
your
polite
invitation
if
it
depended
upon
ourselves
;
*NL*
but
unfortunately
the
thing
is
impossible
--
Monsieur
de
Treville
has
*NL*
forbidden
it
.
Pass
on
your
way
,
then
;
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
raillery
exasperated
Jussac
.
``
We
will
charge
upon
you
,
then
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
if
you
disobey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
five
of
them
,
''
said
Athos
,
half
aloud
,
``
and
we
are
but
three
;
*NL*
we
shall
be
beaten
again
,
and
must
die
on
the
spot
,
for
,
on
my
part
,
I
*NL*
declare
I
will
never
appear
again
before
the
captain
as
a
conquered
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
instantly
drew
near
one
another
,
while
Jussac
*NL*
drew
up
his
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
short
interval
was
sufficient
to
determine
d'Artagnan
on
the
part
*NL*
he
was
to
take
.
It
was
one
of
those
events
which
decide
the
life
of
a
*NL*
man
;
it
was
a
choice
between
the
king
and
the
cardinal
--
the
choice
made
,
*NL*
it
must
be
persisted
in
.
To
fight
,
that
was
to
disobey
the
law
,
that
was
*NL*
to
risk
his
head
,
that
was
to
make
at
one
blow
an
enemy
of
a
minister
*NL*
more
powerful
than
the
king
himself
.
All
this
the
young
man
perceived
,
*NL*
and
yet
,
to
his
praise
we
speak
it
,
he
did
not
hesitate
a
second
.
*NL*
Turning
towards
Athos
and
his
friends
,
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
allow
me
*NL*
to
correct
your
words
,
if
you
please
.
You
said
you
were
but
three
,
but
*NL*
it
appears
to
me
we
are
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
not
one
of
us
,
''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
have
not
the
uniform
,
but
I
have
*NL*
the
spirit
.
My
heart
is
that
of
a
Musketeer
;
I
feel
it
,
monsieur
,
and
*NL*
that
impels
me
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Withdraw
,
young
man
,
''
cried
Jussac
,
who
doubtless
,
by
his
gestures
and
*NL*
the
expression
of
his
countenance
,
had
guessed
d'Artagnan
's
design
.
``
You
*NL*
may
retire
;
we
consent
to
that
.
Save
your
skin
;
begone
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
not
budge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
you
are
a
brave
fellow
,
''
said
Athos
,
pressing
the
young
*NL*
man
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
choose
your
part
,
''
replied
Jussac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Porthos
to
Aramis
,
``
we
must
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
is
full
of
generosity
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
three
reflected
upon
the
youth
of
d'Artagnan
,
and
dreaded
his
*NL*
inexperience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
only
be
three
,
one
of
whom
is
wounded
,
with
the
addition
of
a
*NL*
boy
,
''
resumed
Athos
;
``
and
yet
it
will
not
be
the
less
said
we
were
four
*NL*
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
to
yield
!
''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
IS
difficult
,
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
comprehended
their
irresolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
me
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
swear
to
you
by
my
honor
that
I
*NL*
will
not
go
hence
if
we
are
conquered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
,
my
brave
fellow
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Athos
,
Porthos
,
Aramis
,
and
d'Artagnan
,
forward
!
''
cried
*NL*
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
gentlemen
,
have
you
decided
?
''
cried
Jussac
for
the
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
your
choice
?
''
asked
Jussac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
about
to
have
the
honor
of
charging
you
,
''
replied
Aramis
,
*NL*
lifting
his
hat
with
one
hand
and
drawing
his
sword
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
You
resist
,
do
you
?
''
cried
Jussac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
S'blood
;
does
that
astonish
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
nine
combatants
rushed
upon
each
other
with
a
fury
which
however
*NL*
did
not
exclude
a
certain
degree
of
method
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
fixed
upon
a
certain
Cahusac
,
a
favorite
of
the
cardinal
's
.
*NL*
Porthos
had
Bicarat
,
and
Aramis
found
himself
opposed
to
two
*NL*
adversaries
.
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
he
sprang
toward
Jussac
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heart
of
the
young
Gascon
beat
as
if
it
would
burst
through
his
*NL*
side
--
not
from
fear
,
God
be
thanked
,
he
had
not
the
shade
of
it
,
but
*NL*
with
emulation
;
he
fought
like
a
furious
tiger
,
turning
ten
times
round
*NL*
his
adversary
,
and
changing
his
ground
and
his
guard
twenty
times
.
*NL*
Jussac
was
,
as
was
then
said
,
a
fine
blade
,
and
had
had
much
practice
;
*NL*
nevertheless
it
required
all
his
skill
to
defend
himself
against
an
*NL*
adversary
who
,
active
and
energetic
,
departed
every
instant
from
*NL*
received
rules
,
attacking
him
on
all
sides
at
once
,
and
yet
parrying
*NL*
like
a
man
who
had
the
greatest
respect
for
his
own
epidermis
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
contest
at
length
exhausted
Jussac
's
patience
.
Furious
at
being
*NL*
held
in
check
by
one
whom
he
had
considered
a
boy
,
he
became
warm
and
*NL*
began
to
make
mistakes
.
D'Artagnan
,
who
though
wanting
in
practice
had
a
*NL*
sound
theory
,
redoubled
his
agility
.
Jussac
,
anxious
to
put
an
end
to
*NL*
this
,
springing
forward
,
aimed
a
terrible
thrust
at
his
adversary
,
but
*NL*
the
latter
parried
it
;
and
while
Jussac
was
recovering
himself
,
glided
*NL*
like
a
serpent
beneath
his
blade
,
and
passed
his
sword
through
his
body
.
*NL*
Jussac
fell
like
a
dead
mass
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
cast
an
anxious
and
rapid
glance
over
the
field
of
*NL*
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
had
killed
one
of
his
adversaries
,
but
the
other
pressed
him
*NL*
warmly
.
Nevertheless
,
Aramis
was
in
a
good
situation
,
and
able
to
defend
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bicarat
and
Porthos
had
just
made
counterhits
.
Porthos
had
received
a
*NL*
thrust
through
his
arm
,
and
Bicarat
one
through
his
thigh
.
But
neither
*NL*
of
these
two
wounds
was
serious
,
and
they
only
fought
more
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
wounded
anew
by
Cahusac
,
became
evidently
paler
,
but
did
not
give
*NL*
way
a
foot
.
He
only
changed
his
sword
hand
,
and
fought
with
his
left
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
laws
of
dueling
at
that
period
,
d'Artagnan
was
at
*NL*
liberty
to
assist
whom
he
pleased
.
While
he
was
endeavoring
to
find
out
*NL*
which
of
his
companions
stood
in
greatest
need
,
he
caught
a
glance
from
*NL*
Athos
.
The
glance
was
of
sublime
eloquence
.
Athos
would
have
died
rather
*NL*
than
appeal
for
help
;
but
he
could
look
,
and
with
that
look
ask
*NL*
assistance
.
D'Artagnan
interpreted
it
;
with
a
terrible
bound
he
sprang
*NL*
to
the
side
of
Cahusac
,
crying
,
``
To
me
,
Monsieur
Guardsman
;
I
will
slay
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cahusac
turned
.
It
was
time
;
for
Athos
,
whose
great
courage
alone
*NL*
supported
him
,
sank
upon
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
S'blood
!
''
cried
he
to
d'Artagnan
,
``
do
not
kill
him
,
young
man
,
I
beg
of
*NL*
you
.
I
have
an
old
affair
to
settle
with
him
when
I
am
cured
and
sound
*NL*
again
.
Disarm
him
only
--
make
sure
of
his
sword
.
That
's
it
!
Very
well
*NL*
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exclamation
was
drawn
from
Athos
by
seeing
the
sword
of
Cahusac
fly
*NL*
twenty
paces
from
him
.
D'Artagnan
and
Cahusac
sprang
forward
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
,
the
one
to
recover
,
the
other
to
obtain
,
the
sword
;
but
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
being
the
more
active
,
reached
it
first
and
placed
his
foot
*NL*
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cahusac
immediately
ran
to
the
Guardsman
whom
Aramis
had
killed
,
seized
*NL*
his
rapier
,
and
returned
toward
d'Artagnan
;
but
on
his
way
he
met
Athos
,
*NL*
who
during
his
relief
which
d'Artagnan
had
procured
him
had
recovered
*NL*
his
breath
,
and
who
,
for
fear
that
d'Artagnan
would
kill
his
enemy
,
*NL*
wished
to
resume
the
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
perceived
that
it
would
be
disobliging
Athos
not
to
leave
him
*NL*
alone
;
and
in
a
few
minutes
Cahusac
fell
,
with
a
sword
thrust
through
*NL*
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
Aramis
placed
his
sword
point
on
the
breast
of
his
*NL*
fallen
enemy
,
and
forced
him
to
ask
for
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
only
then
remained
Porthos
and
Bicarat
.
Porthos
made
a
thousand
*NL*
flourishes
,
asking
Bicarat
what
o'clock
it
could
be
,
and
offering
him
*NL*
his
compliments
upon
his
brother
's
having
just
obtained
a
company
in
the
*NL*
regiment
of
Navarre
;
but
,
jest
as
he
might
,
he
gained
nothing
.
Bicarat
*NL*
was
one
of
those
iron
men
who
never
fell
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
it
was
necessary
to
finish
.
The
watch
might
come
up
and
*NL*
take
all
the
combatants
,
wounded
or
not
,
royalists
or
cardinalists
.
*NL*
Athos
,
Aramis
,
and
d'Artagnan
surrounded
Bicarat
,
and
required
him
to
*NL*
surrender
.
Though
alone
against
all
and
with
a
wound
in
his
thigh
,
*NL*
Bicarat
wished
to
hold
out
;
but
Jussac
,
who
had
risen
upon
his
elbow
,
*NL*
cried
out
to
him
to
yield
.
Bicarat
was
a
Gascon
,
as
d'Artagnan
was
;
he
*NL*
turned
a
deaf
ear
,
and
contented
himself
with
laughing
,
and
between
two
*NL*
parries
finding
time
to
point
to
a
spot
of
earth
with
his
sword
,
``
Here
,
''
*NL*
cried
he
,
parodying
a
verse
of
the
Bible
,
``
here
will
Bicarat
die
;
for
I
*NL*
only
am
left
,
and
they
seek
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
are
four
against
you
;
leave
off
,
I
command
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
command
me
,
that
's
another
thing
,
''
said
Bicarat
.
``
As
you
are
*NL*
my
commander
,
it
is
my
duty
to
obey
.
''
And
springing
backward
,
he
broke
*NL*
his
sword
across
his
knee
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
surrendering
it
,
*NL*
threw
the
pieces
over
the
convent
wall
,
and
crossed
him
arms
,
whistling
*NL*
a
cardinalist
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bravery
is
always
respected
,
even
in
an
enemy
.
The
Musketeers
saluted
*NL*
Bicarat
with
their
swords
,
and
returned
them
to
their
sheaths
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
the
same
.
Then
,
assisted
by
Bicarat
,
the
only
one
left
*NL*
standing
,
they
bore
Jussac
,
Cahusac
,
and
one
of
Aramis
's
adversaries
who
*NL*
was
only
wounded
,
under
the
porch
of
the
convent
.
The
fourth
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
was
dead
.
They
then
rang
the
bell
,
and
carrying
away
four
swords
*NL*
out
of
five
,
they
took
their
road
,
intoxicated
with
joy
,
toward
the
*NL*
hotel
of
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
arm
in
arm
,
occupying
the
whole
width
of
the
street
and
*NL*
taking
in
every
Musketeer
they
met
,
so
that
in
the
end
it
became
a
*NL*
triumphal
march
.
The
heart
of
d'Artagnan
swam
in
delirium
;
he
marched
*NL*
between
Athos
and
Porthos
,
pressing
them
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
not
yet
a
Musketeer
,
''
said
he
to
his
new
friends
,
as
he
passed
*NL*
through
the
gateway
of
M.
de
Treville
's
hotel
,
``
at
least
I
have
entered
*NL*
upon
my
apprenticeship
,
have
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
6
HIS
MAJESTY
KING
LOUIS
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
affair
made
a
great
noise
.
M.
de
Treville
scolded
his
Musketeers
in
*NL*
public
,
and
congratulated
them
in
private
;
but
as
no
time
was
to
be
lost
*NL*
in
gaining
the
king
,
M.
de
Treville
hastened
to
report
himself
at
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
It
was
already
too
late
.
The
king
was
closeted
with
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
and
M.
de
Treville
was
informed
that
the
king
was
busy
and
*NL*
could
not
receive
him
at
that
moment
.
In
the
evening
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
attended
the
king
's
gaming
table
.
The
king
was
winning
;
and
as
he
was
*NL*
very
avaricious
,
he
was
in
an
excellent
humor
.
Perceiving
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
at
a
distance
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
Monsieur
Captain
,
''
said
he
,
``
come
here
,
that
I
may
growl
at
*NL*
you
.
Do
you
know
that
his
Eminence
has
been
making
fresh
complaints
*NL*
against
your
Musketeers
,
and
that
with
so
much
emotion
,
that
this
*NL*
evening
his
Eminence
is
indisposed
?
Ah
,
these
Musketeers
of
yours
are
*NL*
very
devils
--
fellows
to
be
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sire
,
''
replied
Treville
,
who
saw
at
the
first
glance
how
things
*NL*
would
go
,
``
on
the
contrary
,
they
are
good
creatures
,
as
meek
as
lambs
,
*NL*
and
have
but
one
desire
,
I
'll
be
their
warranty
.
And
that
is
that
their
*NL*
swords
may
never
leave
their
scabbards
but
in
your
majesty
's
service
.
*NL*
But
what
are
they
to
do
?
The
Guards
of
Monsieur
the
Cardinal
are
forever
*NL*
seeking
quarrels
with
them
,
and
for
the
honor
of
the
corps
even
,
the
*NL*
poor
young
men
are
obliged
to
defend
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
''
said
the
king
;
``
listen
to
him
!
Would
*NL*
not
one
say
he
was
speaking
of
a
religious
community
?
In
truth
,
my
dear
*NL*
Captain
,
I
have
a
great
mind
to
take
away
your
commission
and
give
it
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Chemerault
,
to
whom
I
promised
an
abbey
.
But
do
n't
fancy
*NL*
that
I
am
going
to
take
you
on
your
bare
word
.
I
am
called
Louis
the
*NL*
Just
,
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
and
by
and
by
,
by
and
by
we
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sire
;
it
is
because
I
confide
in
that
justice
that
I
shall
wait
*NL*
patiently
and
quietly
the
good
pleasure
of
your
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
then
,
monsieur
,
wait
,
''
said
the
king
;
``
I
will
not
detain
you
*NL*
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
fortune
changed
;
and
as
the
king
began
to
lose
what
he
had
won
,
*NL*
he
was
not
sorry
to
find
an
excuse
for
playing
Charlemagne
--
if
we
may
*NL*
use
a
gaming
phrase
of
whose
origin
we
confess
our
ignorance
.
The
king
*NL*
therefore
arose
a
minute
after
,
and
putting
the
money
which
lay
before
*NL*
him
into
his
pocket
,
the
major
part
of
which
arose
from
his
winnings
,
*NL*
``
La
Vieuville
,
''
said
he
,
``
take
my
place
;
I
must
speak
to
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
on
an
affair
of
importance
.
Ah
,
I
had
eighty
louis
before
me
;
*NL*
put
down
the
same
sum
,
so
that
they
who
have
lost
may
have
nothing
to
*NL*
complain
of
.
Justice
before
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
toward
M.
de
Treville
and
walking
with
him
toward
the
*NL*
embrasure
of
a
window
,
``
Well
,
monsieur
,
''
continued
he
,
``
you
say
it
is
*NL*
his
Eminence
's
Guards
who
have
sought
a
quarrel
with
your
Musketeers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
as
they
always
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
the
thing
happen
?
Let
us
see
,
for
you
know
,
my
dear
*NL*
Captain
,
a
judge
must
hear
both
sides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
In
the
most
simple
and
natural
manner
possible
.
Three
of
my
*NL*
best
soldiers
,
whom
your
Majesty
knows
by
name
,
and
whose
devotedness
*NL*
you
have
more
than
once
appreciated
,
and
who
have
,
I
dare
affirm
to
the
*NL*
king
,
his
service
much
at
heart
--
three
of
my
best
soldiers
,
I
say
,
*NL*
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
,
had
made
a
party
of
pleasure
with
a
young
*NL*
fellow
from
Gascony
,
whom
I
had
introduced
to
them
the
same
morning
.
The
*NL*
party
was
to
take
place
at
St.
Germain
,
I
believe
,
and
they
had
*NL*
appointed
to
meet
at
the
Carmes-Deschaux
,
when
they
were
disturbed
by
de
*NL*
Jussac
,
Cahusac
,
Bicarat
,
and
two
other
Guardsmen
,
who
certainly
did
not
*NL*
go
there
in
such
a
numerous
company
without
some
ill
intention
against
*NL*
the
edicts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
You
incline
me
to
think
so
,
''
said
the
king
.
``
There
is
no
doubt
*NL*
they
went
thither
to
fight
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
accuse
them
,
sire
;
but
I
leave
your
Majesty
to
judge
what
five
*NL*
armed
men
could
possibly
be
going
to
do
in
such
a
deserted
place
as
the
*NL*
neighborhood
of
the
Convent
des
Carmes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
right
,
Treville
,
you
are
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
upon
seeing
my
Musketeers
they
changed
their
minds
,
and
forgot
*NL*
their
private
hatred
for
partisan
hatred
;
for
your
Majesty
can
not
be
*NL*
ignorant
that
the
Musketeers
,
who
belong
to
the
king
and
nobody
but
the
*NL*
king
,
are
the
natural
enemies
of
the

who
belong
to
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Treville
,
yes
,
''
said
the
king
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
;
``
and
it
is
*NL*
very
sad
,
believe
me

to
see
thus
two
parties
in
France

two
heads

*NL*
royalty

But
all
this
will
come
to
an
end
,
Treville
,
will
come
to
an
*NL*
end

You
say
,
then
,
that
the
Guardsmen
sought
a
quarrel
with
the
*NL*
Musketeers
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say

it
is
probable
that
things
have
fallen
out
so

I
will
*NL*
not
swear
to
it
,
sire
.
You
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
discover
the
*NL*
truth
;
and
unless
a
man
be
endowed
with
that
admirable
instinct
which

causes
Louis
XIII
to
be
named
the
Just

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

Treville

they
were
not

with

*NL*
*NL*

of
whom
was
wounded

a
youth
not

maintained

their
ground
against
five
of
the
most
terrible
of
the
cardinal
's

Guardsmen
,
but
absolutely
brought
four
of
them
to
earth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

this
is
a
victory
!

cried
the
king

all
radiant
,
``

*NL*
``
Yes

Four

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hardly

admirably

will
take
the

recommending

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
And
Louis
XIII
twisted
his
mustache
proudly
,
placing
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
hip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
resumed
Treville
,
``
as
I
told
you
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
is
little
*NL*
more
than
a
boy
;
and
as
he
has
not
the
honor
of
being
a
Musketeer
,
he
*NL*
was
dressed
as
a
citizen
.
The
Guards
of
the
cardinal
,
perceiving
his
*NL*
youth
and
that
he
did
not
belong
to
the
corps
,
invited
him
to
retire
*NL*
before
they
attacked

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
may
plainly
see
,
Treville

interrupted
the
king
,
``
it
was
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true

there
can
be
no
more
doubt
on
that
head

They
*NL*
called
upon
him
then
to
retire
;
but
he
answered
that
he
was
a
Musketeer
*NL*
at
heart

entirely
devoted
to
your
Majesty

that
therefore
he
would

*NL*
``
Brave

murmured
the
king

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
did
remain
with

your

in

so
firm

made

angry

*NL*

the

When

Devoted

are
so
rare

Treville

by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Treville

an

is
still
an

all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
encounter
,
sire
,
is
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
conditions
of
a
*NL*
duel
.
It
is
a
brawl
;
and
the
proof
is
that
there
were
five
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
's
Guardsmen
against
my
three
Musketeers
and
Monsieur
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
king
;
``
but
never
mind
,
Treville
,
come
still
by
*NL*
the
back
staircase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Treville
smiled
;
but
as
it
was
indeed
something
to
have
prevailed
upon
*NL*
this
child
to
rebel
against
his
master
,
he
saluted
the
king
*NL*
respectfully
,
and
with
this
agreement
,
took
leave
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
the
three
Musketeers
were
informed
of
the
honor
accorded
*NL*
them
.
As
they
had
long
been
acquainted
with
the
king
,
they
were
not
much
*NL*
excited
;
but
d'Artagnan
,
with
his
Gascon
imagination
,
saw
in
it
his
*NL*
future
fortune
,
and
passed
the
night
in
golden
dreams
.
By
eight
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
he
was
at
the
apartment
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
found
the
Musketeer
dressed
and
ready
to
go
out
.
As
the
hour
*NL*
to
wait
upon
the
king
was
not
till
twelve
,
he
had
made
a
party
with
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
to
play
a
game
at
tennis
in
a
tennis
court
situated
*NL*
near
the
stables
of
the
Luxembourg
.
Athos
invited
d'Artagnan
to
follow
*NL*
them
;
and
although
ignorant
of
the
game
,
which
he
had
never
played
,
he
*NL*
accepted
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
time
from
nine
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
as
it
then
scarcely
was
,
till
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Musketeers
were
already
there
,
and
were
playing
together
.
Athos
,
*NL*
who
was
very
expert
in
all
bodily
exercises
,
passed
with
d'Artagnan
to
*NL*
the
opposite
side
and
challenged
them
;
but
at
the
first
effort
he
made
,
*NL*
although
he
played
with
his
left
hand
,
he
found
that
his
wound
was
yet
*NL*
too
recent
to
allow
of
such
exertion
.
D'Artagnan
remained
,
therefore
,
*NL*
alone
;
and
as
he
declared
he
was
too
ignorant
of
the
game
to
play
it
*NL*
regularly
they
only
continued
giving
balls
to
one
another
without
*NL*
counting
.
But
one
of
these
balls
,
launched
by
Porthos
'
herculean
hand
,
*NL*
passed
so
close
to
d'Artagnan
's
face
that
he
thought
that
if
,
instead
of
*NL*
passing
near
,
it
had
hit
him
,
his
audience
would
have
been
probably
*NL*
lost
,
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
present
himself
before
*NL*
the
king
.
Now
,
as
upon
this
audience
,
in
his
Gascon
imagination
,
*NL*
depended
his
future
life
,
he
saluted
Aramis
and
Porthos
politely
,
*NL*
declaring
that
he
would
not
resume
the
game
until
he
should
be
prepared
*NL*
to
play
with
them
on
more
equal
terms
,
and
went
and
took
his
place
near
*NL*
the
cord
and
in
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
for
d'Artagnan
,
among
the
spectators
was
one
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
's
Guardsmen
,
who
,
still
irritated
by
the
defeat
of
his
*NL*
companions
,
which
had
happened
only
the
day
before
,
had
promised
himself
*NL*
to
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
avenging
it
.
He
believed
this
*NL*
opportunity
was
now
come
and
addressed
his
neighbor
:
``
It
is
not
*NL*
astonishing
that
that
young
man
should
be
afraid
of
a
ball
,
for
he
is
*NL*
doubtless
a
Musketeer
apprentice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
turned
round
as
if
a
serpent
had
stung
him
,
and
fixed
his
*NL*
eyes
intensely
upon
the
Guardsman
who
had
just
made
this
insolent
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARDIEU
,
''
resumed
the
latter
,
twisting
his
mustache
,
``
look
at
me
as
*NL*
long
as
you
like
,
my
little
gentleman
!
I
have
said
what
I
have
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
since
that
which
you
have
said
is
too
clear
to
require
any
*NL*
explanation
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
I
beg
you
to
follow
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
?
''
asked
the
Guardsman
,
with
the
same
jeering
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
once
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
who
I
am
,
without
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
am
completely
ignorant
;
nor
does
it
much
disquiet
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
the
wrong
there
;
for
if
you
knew
my
name
,
perhaps
you
would
*NL*
not
be
so
pressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bernajoux
,
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Monsieur
Bernajoux
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
tranquilly
,
``
I
will
*NL*
wait
for
you
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
monsieur
,
I
will
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
hurry
yourself
,
monsieur
,
lest
it
be
observed
that
we
go
out
*NL*
together
.
You
must
be
aware
that
for
our
undertaking
,
company
would
be
*NL*
in
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
the
Guardsman
,
astonished
that
his
name
had
not
*NL*
produced
more
effect
upon
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
name
of
Bernajoux
was
known
to
all
the
world
,
d'Artagnan
*NL*
alone
excepted
,
perhaps
;
for
it
was
one
of
those
which
figured
most
*NL*
frequently
in
the
daily
brawls
which
all
the
edicts
of
the
cardinal
*NL*
could
not
repress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
were
so
engaged
with
their
game
,
and
Athos
was
*NL*
watching
them
with
so
much
attention
,
that
they
did
not
even
perceive
*NL*
their
young
companion
go
out
,
who
,
as
he
had
told
the
Guardsman
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
,
stopped
outside
the
door
.
An
instant
after
,
the
Guardsman
*NL*
descended
in
his
turn
.
As
d'Artagnan
had
no
time
to
lose
,
on
account
of
*NL*
the
audience
of
the
king
,
which
was
fixed
for
midday
,
he
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
around
,
and
seeing
that
the
street
was
empty
,
said
to
his
adversary
,
``
My
*NL*
faith
!
It
is
fortunate
for
you
,
although
your
name
is
Bernajoux
,
to
have
*NL*
only
to
deal
with
an
apprentice
Musketeer
.
Never
mind
;
be
content
,
I
*NL*
will
do
my
best
.
On
guard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
he
whom
d'Artagnan
thus
provoked
,
``
it
appears
to
me
that
*NL*
this
place
is
badly
chosen
,
and
that
we
should
be
better
behind
the
*NL*
Abbey
St.
Germain
or
in
the
Pre-aux-Clercs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
is
full
of
sense
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
unfortunately
*NL*
I
have
very
little
time
to
spare
,
having
an
appointment
at
twelve
*NL*
precisely
.
On
guard
,
then
,
monsieur
,
on
guard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bernajoux
was
not
a
man
to
have
such
a
compliment
paid
to
him
twice
.
In
*NL*
an
instant
his
sword
glittered
in
his
hand
,
and
he
sprang
upon
his
*NL*
adversary
,
whom
,
thanks
to
his
great
youthfulness
,
he
hoped
to
*NL*
intimidate
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
had
on
the
preceding
day
served
his
apprenticeship
.
Fresh
*NL*
sharpened
by
his
victory
,
full
of
hopes
of
future
favor
,
he
was
resolved
*NL*
not
to
recoil
a
step
.
So
the
two
swords
were
crossed
close
to
the
hilts
,
*NL*
and
as
d'Artagnan
stood
firm
,
it
was
his
adversary
who
made
the
*NL*
retreating
step
;
but
d'Artagnan
seized
the
moment
at
which
,
in
this
*NL*
movement
,
the
sword
of
Bernajoux
deviated
from
the
line
.
He
freed
his
*NL*
weapon
,
made
a
lunge
,
and
touched
his
adversary
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
immediately
made
a
step
backward
and
raised
his
sword
;
but
*NL*
Bernajoux
cried
out
that
it
was
nothing
,
and
rushing
blindly
upon
him
,
*NL*
absolutely
spitted
himself
upon
d'Artagnan
's
sword
.
As
,
however
,
he
did
*NL*
not
fall
,
as
he
did
not
declare
himself
conquered
,
but
only
broke
away
*NL*
toward
the
hotel
of
M.
de
la
Tremouille
,
in
whose
service
he
had
a
*NL*
relative
,
d'Artagnan
was
ignorant
of
the
seriousness
of
the
last
wound
*NL*
his
adversary
had
received
,
and
pressing
him
warmly
,
without
doubt
would
*NL*
soon
have
completed
his
work
with
a
third
blow
,
when
the
noise
which
*NL*
arose
from
the
street
being
heard
in
the
tennis
court
,
two
of
the
*NL*
friends
of
the
Guardsman
,
who
had
seen
him
go
out
after
exchanging
some
*NL*
words
with
d'Artagnan
,
rushed
,
sword
in
hand
,
from
the
court
,
and
fell
*NL*
upon
the
conqueror
.
But
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
quickly
appeared
in
*NL*
their
turn
,
and
the
moment
the
two
Guardsmen
attacked
their
young
*NL*
companion
,
drove
them
back
.
Bernajoux
now
fell
,
and
as
the
Guardsmen
*NL*
were
only
two
against
four
,
they
began
to
cry
,
``
To
the
rescue
!
The
Hotel
*NL*
de
la
Tremouille
!
''
At
these
cries
,
all
who
were
in
the
hotel
rushed
out
*NL*
and
fell
upon
the
four
companions
,
who
on
their
side
cried
aloud
,
``
To
*NL*
the
rescue
,
Musketeers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
cry
was
generally
heeded
;
for
the
Musketeers
were
known
to
be
*NL*
enemies
of
the
cardinal
,
and
were
beloved
on
account
of
the
hatred
they
*NL*
bore
to
his
Eminence
.
Thus
the
soldiers
of
other
companies
than
those
*NL*
which
belonged
to
the
Red
Duke
,
as
Aramis
had
called
him
,
often
took
*NL*
part
with
the
king
's
Musketeers
in
these
quarrels
.
Of
three
Guardsmen
of
*NL*
the
company
of
M.
Dessessart
who
were
passing
,
two
came
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
the
four
companions
,
while
the
other
ran
toward
the
hotel
*NL*
of
M.
de
Treville
,
crying
,
``
To
the
rescue
,
Musketeers
!
To
the
rescue
!
''
*NL*
As
usual
,
this
hotel
was
full
of
soldiers
of
this
company
,
who
hastened
*NL*
to
the
succor
of
their
comrades
.
The
MELEE
became
general
,
but
strength
*NL*
was
on
the
side
of
the
Musketeers
.
The
cardinal
's
Guards
and
M.
de
la
*NL*
Tremouille
's
people
retreated
into
the
hotel
,
the
doors
of
which
they
*NL*
closed
just
in
time
to
prevent
their
enemies
from
entering
with
them
.
As
*NL*
to
the
wounded
man
,
he
had
been
taken
in
at
once
,
and
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
in
a
very
bad
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excitement
was
at
its
height
among
the
Musketeers
and
their
allies
,
and
*NL*
they
even
began
to
deliberate
whether
they
should
not
set
fire
to
the
*NL*
hotel
to
punish
the
insolence
of
M.
de
la
Tremouille
's
domestics
in
*NL*
daring
to
make
a
SORTIE
upon
the
king
's
Musketeers
.
The
proposition
had
*NL*
been
made
,
and
received
with
enthusiasm
,
when
fortunately
eleven
o'clock
*NL*
struck
.
D'Artagnan
and
his
companions
remembered
their
audience
,
and
as
*NL*
they
would
very
much
have
regretted
that
such
an
opportunity
should
be
*NL*
lost
,
they
succeeded
in
calming
their
friends
,
who
contented
themselves
*NL*
with
hurling
some
paving
stones
against
the
gates
;
but
the
gates
were
*NL*
too
strong
.
They
soon
tired
of
the
sport
.
Besides
,
those
who
must
be
*NL*
considered
the
leaders
of
the
enterprise
had
quit
the
group
and
were
*NL*
making
their
way
toward
the
hotel
of
M.
de
Treville
,
who
was
waiting
for
*NL*
them
,
already
informed
of
this
fresh
disturbance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
to
the
Louvre
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
the
Louvre
without
losing
an
*NL*
instant
,
and
let
us
endeavor
to
see
the
king
before
he
is
prejudiced
by
*NL*
the
cardinal
.
We
will
describe
the
thing
to
him
as
a
consequence
of
the
*NL*
affair
of
yesterday
,
and
the
two
will
pass
off
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
,
accompanied
by
the
four
young
fellows
,
directed
his
*NL*
course
toward
the
Louvre
;
but
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
captain
*NL*
of
the
Musketeers
,
he
was
informed
that
the
king
had
gone
stag
hunting
*NL*
in
the
forest
of
St.
Germain
.
M.
de
Treville
required
this
intelligence
*NL*
to
be
repeated
to
him
twice
,
and
each
time
his
companions
saw
his
brow
*NL*
become
darker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
his
Majesty
,
''
asked
he
,
``
any
intention
of
holding
this
hunting
*NL*
party
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
your
Excellency
,
''
replied
the
valet
de
chambre
,
``
the
Master
of
the
*NL*
Hounds
came
this
morning
to
inform
him
that
he
had
marked
down
a
stag
.
*NL*
At
first
the
king
answered
that
he
would
not
go
;
but
he
could
not
resist
*NL*
his
love
of
sport
,
and
set
out
after
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
king
has
seen
the
cardinal
?
''
asked
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
all
probability
he
has
,
''
replied
the
valet
,
``
for
I
saw
the
horses
*NL*
harnessed
to
his
Eminence
's
carriage
this
morning
,
and
when
I
asked
*NL*
where
he
was
going
,
they
told
me
,
`
To
St.
Germain
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
beforehand
with
us
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
.
``
Gentlemen
,
I
will
see
*NL*
the
king
this
evening
;
but
as
to
you
,
I
do
not
advise
you
to
risk
doing
*NL*
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
was
too
reasonable
,
and
moreover
came
from
a
man
who
knew
*NL*
the
king
too
well
,
to
allow
the
four
young
men
to
dispute
it
.
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
recommended
everyone
to
return
home
and
wait
for
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
his
hotel
,
M.
de
Treville
thought
it
best
to
be
first
in
*NL*
making
the
complaint
.
He
sent
one
of
his
servants
to
M.
de
la
Tremouille
*NL*
with
a
letter
in
which
he
begged
of
him
to
eject
the
cardinal
's
*NL*
Guardsmen
from
his
house
,
and
to
reprimand
his
people
for
their
audacity
*NL*
in
making
SORTIE
against
the
king
's
Musketeers
.
But
M.
de
la
*NL*
Tremouille
--
already
prejudiced
by
his
esquire
,
whose
relative
,
as
we
*NL*
already
know
,
Bernajoux
was
--
replied
that
it
was
neither
for
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
nor
the
Musketeers
to
complain
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
for
him
,
*NL*
whose
people
the
Musketeers
had
assaulted
and
whose
hotel
they
had
*NL*
endeavored
to
burn
.
Now
,
as
the
debate
between
these
two
nobles
might
*NL*
last
a
long
time
,
each
becoming
,
naturally
,
more
firm
in
his
own
*NL*
opinion
,
M.
de
Treville
thought
of
an
expedient
which
might
terminate
it
*NL*
quietly
.
This
was
to
go
himself
to
M.
de
la
Tremouille
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repaired
,
therefore
,
immediately
to
his
hotel
,
and
caused
himself
to
*NL*
be
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
nobles
saluted
each
other
politely
,
for
if
no
friendship
existed
*NL*
between
them
,
there
was
at
least
esteem
.
Both
were
men
of
courage
and
*NL*
honor
;
and
as
M.
de
la
Tremouille
--
a
Protestant
,
and
seeing
the
king
*NL*
seldom
--
was
of
no
party
,
he
did
not
,
in
general
,
carry
any
bias
into
his
*NL*
social
relations
.
This
time
,
however
,
his
address
,
although
polite
,
was
*NL*
cooler
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
,
``
we
fancy
that
we
have
each
cause
to
*NL*
complain
of
the
other
,
and
I
am
come
to
endeavor
to
clear
up
this
*NL*
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
objection
,
''
replied
M.
de
la
Tremouille
,
``
but
I
warn
you
that
*NL*
I
am
well
informed
,
and
all
the
fault
is
with
your
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
just
and
reasonable
a
man
,
monsieur
!
''
said
Treville
,
``
not
*NL*
to
accept
the
proposal
I
am
about
to
make
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
it
,
monsieur
,
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Monsieur
Bernajoux
,
your
esquire
's
relative
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
monsieur
,
very
ill
indeed
!
In
addition
to
the
sword
thrust
in
his
*NL*
arm
,
which
is
not
dangerous
,
he
has
received
another
right
through
his
*NL*
lungs
,
of
which
the
doctor
says
bad
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
has
the
wounded
man
retained
his
senses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
talk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
difficulty
,
but
he
can
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
monsieur
,
let
us
go
to
him
.
Let
us
adjure
him
,
in
the
name
of
the
*NL*
God
before
whom
he
must
perhaps
appear
,
to
speak
the
truth
.
I
will
take
*NL*
him
for
judge
in
his
own
cause
,
monsieur
,
and
will
believe
what
he
will
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
la
Tremouille
reflected
for
an
instant
;
then
as
it
was
difficult
to
*NL*
suggest
a
more
reasonable
proposal
,
he
agreed
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
descended
to
the
chamber
in
which
the
wounded
man
lay
.
The
latter
,
*NL*
on
seeing
these
two
noble
lords
who
came
to
visit
him
,
endeavored
to
*NL*
raise
himself
up
in
his
bed
;
but
he
was
too
weak
,
and
exhausted
by
the
*NL*
effort
,
he
fell
back
again
almost
senseless
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
la
Tremouille
approached
him
,
and
made
him
inhale
some
salts
,
which
*NL*
recalled
him
to
life
.
Then
M.
de
Treville
,
unwilling
that
it
should
be
*NL*
thought
that
he
had
influenced
the
wounded
man
,
requested
M.
de
la
*NL*
Tremouille
to
interrogate
him
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
happened
which
M.
de
Treville
had
foreseen
.
Placed
between
life
and
*NL*
death
,
as
Bernajoux
was
,
he
had
no
idea
for
a
moment
of
concealing
the
*NL*
truth
;
and
he
described
to
the
two
nobles
the
affair
exactly
as
it
had
*NL*
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
that
M.
de
Treville
wanted
.
He
wished
Bernajoux
a
speedy
*NL*
convalescence
,
took
leave
of
M.
de
la
Tremouille
,
returned
to
his
hotel
,
*NL*
and
immediately
sent
word
to
the
four
friends
that
he
awaited
their
*NL*
company
at
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
entertained
good
company
,
wholly
anticardinalist
,
though
.
*NL*
It
may
easily
be
understood
,
therefore
,
that
the
conversation
during
the
*NL*
whole
of
dinner
turned
upon
the
two
checks
that
his
Eminence
's
Guardsmen
*NL*
had
received
.
Now
,
as
d'Artagnan
had
been
the
hero
of
these
two
fights
,
*NL*
it
was
upon
him
that
all
the
felicitations
fell
,
which
Athos
,
Porthos
,
*NL*
and
Aramis
abandoned
to
him
,
not
only
as
good
comrades
,
but
as
men
who
*NL*
had
so
often
had
their
turn
that
they
could
very
well
afford
him
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
six
o'clock
M.
de
Treville
announced
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
*NL*
the
Louvre
;
but
as
the
hour
of
audience
granted
by
his
Majesty
was
past
,
*NL*
instead
of
claiming
the
ENTREE
by
the
back
stairs
,
he
placed
himself
*NL*
with
the
four
young
men
in
the
antechamber
.
The
king
had
not
yet
*NL*
returned
from
hunting
.
Our
young
men
had
been
waiting
about
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
amid
a
crowd
of
courtiers
,
when
all
the
doors
were
thrown
open
,
*NL*
and
his
Majesty
was
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
announcement
d'Artagnan
felt
himself
tremble
to
the
very
marrow
*NL*
of
his
bones
.
The
coming
instant
would
in
all
probability
decide
the
*NL*
rest
of
his
life
.
His
eyes
therefore
were
fixed
in
a
sort
of
agony
upon
*NL*
the
door
through
which
the
king
must
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XIII
appeared
,
walking
fast
.
He
was
in
hunting
costume
covered
*NL*
with
dust
,
wearing
large
boots
,
and
holding
a
whip
in
his
hand
.
At
the
*NL*
first
glance
,
d'Artagnan
judged
that
the
mind
of
the
king
was
stormy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
disposition
,
visible
as
it
was
in
his
Majesty
,
did
not
prevent
the
*NL*
courtiers
from
ranging
themselves
along
his
pathway
.
In
royal
*NL*
antechambers
it
is
worth
more
to
be
viewed
with
an
angry
eye
than
not
to
*NL*
be
seen
at
all
.
The
three
Musketeers
therefore
did
not
hesitate
to
make
*NL*
a
step
forward
.
D'Artagnan
on
the
contrary
remained
concealed
behind
*NL*
them
;
but
although
the
king
knew
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
personally
,
*NL*
he
passed
before
them
without
speaking
or
looking
--
indeed
,
as
if
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
them
before
.
As
for
M.
de
Treville
,
when
the
eyes
of
the
king
*NL*
fell
upon
him
,
he
sustained
the
look
with
so
much
firmness
that
it
was
*NL*
the
king
who
dropped
his
eyes
;
after
which
his
Majesty
,
grumbling
,
*NL*
entered
his
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matters
go
but
badly
,
''
said
Athos
,
smiling
;
``
and
we
shall
not
be
made
*NL*
Chevaliers
of
the
Order
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
here
ten
minutes
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
;
``
and
if
at
the
expiration
*NL*
of
ten
minutes
you
do
not
see
me
come
out
,
return
to
my
hotel
,
for
it
*NL*
will
be
useless
for
you
to
wait
for
me
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
young
men
waited
ten
minutes
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
twenty
*NL*
minutes
;
and
seeing
that
M.
de
Treville
did
not
return
,
went
away
very
*NL*
uneasy
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
entered
the
king
's
cabinet
boldly
,
and
found
his
Majesty
*NL*
in
a
very
ill
humor
,
seated
on
an
armchair
,
beating
his
boot
with
the
*NL*
handle
of
his
whip
.
This
,
however
,
did
not
prevent
his
asking
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
coolness
,
after
his
Majesty
's
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
,
monsieur
,
bad
!
''
replied
the
king
;
``
I
am
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
,
in
fact
,
the
worst
complaint
of
Louis
XIII
,
who
would
*NL*
sometimes
take
one
of
his
courtiers
to
a
window
and
say
,
``
Monsieur
*NL*
So-and-so
,
let
us
weary
ourselves
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
Your
Majesty
is
bored
?
Have
you
not
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
the
*NL*
chase
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
pleasure
,
indeed
,
monsieur
!
Upon
my
soul
,
everything
*NL*
degenerates
;
and
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
is
the
game
which
leaves
no
*NL*
scent
,
or
the
dogs
that
have
no
noses
.
We
started
a
stag
of
ten
*NL*
branches
.
We
chased
him
for
six
hours
,
and
when
he
was
near
being
*NL*
taken
--
when
St.-Simon
was
already
putting
his
horn
to
his
mouth
to
sound
*NL*
the
mort
--
crack
,
all
the
pack
takes
the
wrong
scent
and
sets
off
after
a
*NL*
two-year-older
.
I
shall
be
obliged
to
give
up
hunting
,
as
I
have
given
*NL*
up
hawking
.
Ah
,
I
am
an
unfortunate
king
,
Monsieur
de
Treville
!
I
had
*NL*
but
one
gerfalcon
,
and
he
died
day
before
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sire
,
I
wholly
comprehend
your
disappointment
.
The
misfortune
*NL*
is
great
;
but
I
think
you
have
still
a
good
number
of
falcons
,
sparrow
*NL*
hawks
,
and
tiercels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
a
man
to
instruct
them
.
Falconers
are
declining
.
I
know
no
one
*NL*
but
myself
who
is
acquainted
with
the
noble
art
of
venery
.
After
me
it
*NL*
will
all
be
over
,
and
people
will
hunt
with
gins
,
snares
,
and
traps
.
If
*NL*
I
had
but
the
time
to
train
pupils
!
But
there
is
the
cardinal
always
at
*NL*
hand
,
who
does
not
leave
me
a
moment
's
repose
;
who
talks
to
me
about
*NL*
Spain
,
who
talks
to
me
about
Austria
,
who
talks
to
me
about
England
!
Ah
!
*NL*
A
PROPOS
of
the
cardinal
,
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
I
am
vexed
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
chance
at
which
M.
de
Treville
waited
for
the
king
.
He
knew
*NL*
the
king
of
old
,
and
he
knew
that
all
these
complaints
were
but
a
*NL*
preface
--
a
sort
of
excitation
to
encourage
himself
--
and
that
he
had
now
*NL*
come
to
his
point
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in

unfortunate

the

Is
it
for

assassinate

set
fire

continued
the

my

*NL*

However
ill

M.

slept
still
worse

He

had
ordered
his
three
Musketeers
and
their
companion
to
be
with
him
at
*NL*
half
past
six
in
the
morning
.
He
took
them
with
him
,
without
encouraging
*NL*
them
or
promising
them
anything
,
and
without
concealing
from
them
that
*NL*
their
luck
,
and
even
his
own
,
depended
upon
the
cast
of
the
dice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
back
stairs
,
he
desired
them
to
wait
.
If
the
*NL*
king
was
still
irritated
against
them
,
they
would
depart
without
being
*NL*
seen

if
the

consented
to
see

they
would

have

called

*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
king

private
antechamber
,
M.
de
Treville
found
La
*NL*
Chesnaye
,
who
informed
him
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
find
M.
de

*NL*
Tremouille
on
the
preceding
evening
at
his
hotel
,
that
he
returned
too
*NL*
late
to
present
himself
at
the
Louvre
,
that
he
had
only
that
moment
*NL*
arrived
and
that
he
was
at
that
very
hour
with
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
pleased
M.
de
Treville
much
,
as
he
thus
became
certain
*NL*
that
no
foreign
suggestion
could
insinuate
itself
between
M.
de
la
*NL*
Tremouille
's
testimony
and
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
ten
minutes
had
scarcely
passed
away
when
the
door
of

*NL*
king

closet
opened
,
and
M.
de
Treville
saw
M.
de
la
Tremouille
come
*NL*
out
.
The
duke
came
straight
up
to
him
,
and
said
:
``
Monsieur

Treville

*NL*
his

has
just
sent
for
me

inquire
respecting
the

circumstances
which
took
place
yesterday
at

I
have
told
him
*NL*
the
truth
;
that
is
to
say
,
that
the
fault
lay
with
my
people
,
and
that
I
*NL*
was
ready
to
offer
you
my
excuses

Since
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
*NL*
you

I
beg
you
to
receive
them

hold
me
always
as
one

friends

*NL*
``
Monsieur

M.

I
was
so
confident

I
required
no
other
defender
before

yourself
.
I
find
that
I
have
not
been
mistaken
,

I
thank
you
that
*NL*
there
is
still
one
man
in

may

disappointment

what
I
have
said

you

I
also

be

he
*NL*
neglects
me

nearly
three

have
seen

I
never
do

saluted

retired

At
the
moment
he
opened
the
door

the
*NL*
three
Musketeers

d'Artagnan

conducted
by

appeared
at

closely
behind

D'Artagnan
related
the
adventure
of
the
preceding
day
in
all
its
*NL*
details
;
how
,
not
having
been
able
to
sleep
for
the
joy
he
felt
in
the
*NL*
expectation
of
seeing
his
Majesty
,
he
had
gone
to
his
three
friends
*NL*
three
hours
before
the
hour
of
audience
;
how
they
had
gone
together
to
*NL*
the
tennis
court
,
and
how
,
upon
the
fear
he
had
manifested
lest
he
*NL*
receive
a
ball
in
the
face
,
he
had
been
jeered
at
by
Bernajoux
,
who
had
*NL*
nearly
paid
for
his
jeer
with
his
life
,
and
M.
de
la
Tremouille
,
who
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
,
with
the
loss
of
his
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
very
well
,
''
murmured
the
king
,
``
yes
,
this
is
just
the
*NL*
account
the
duke
gave
me
of
the
affair
.
Poor
cardinal
!
Seven
men
in
two
*NL*
days
,
and
those
of
his
very
best
!
But
that
's
quite
enough
,
gentlemen
;
*NL*
please
to
understand
,
that
's
enough
.
You
have
taken
your
revenge
for
the
*NL*
Rue
Ferou
,
and
even
exceeded
it
;
you
ought
to
be
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
Majesty
is
so
,
''
said
Treville
,
``
we
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
am
,
''
added
the
king
,
taking
a
handful
of
gold
from
La
*NL*
Chesnaye
,
and
putting
it
into
the
hand
of
d'Artagnan
.
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
is
a
proof
of
my
satisfaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
epoch
,
the
ideas
of
pride
which
are
in
fashion
in
our
days
did
*NL*
not
prevail
.
A
gentleman
received
,
from
hand
to
hand
,
money
from
the
*NL*
king
,
and
was
not
the
least
in
the
world
humiliated
.
D'Artagnan
put
his
*NL*
forty
pistoles
into
his
pocket
without
any
scruple
--
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
thanking
his
Majesty
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
the
king
,
looking
at
a
clock
,
``
there
,
now
,
as
it
is
half
*NL*
past
eight
,
you
may
retire
;
for
as
I
told
you
,
I
expect
someone
at
nine
.
*NL*
Thanks
for
your
devotedness
,
gentlemen
.
I
may
continue
to
rely
upon
it
,
*NL*
may
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sire
!
''
cried
the
four
companions
,
with
one
voice
,
``
we
would
allow
*NL*
ourselves
to
be
cut
to
pieces
in
your
Majesty
's
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
but
keep
whole
;
that
will
be
better
,
and
you
will
be
more
*NL*
useful
to
me
.
Treville
,
''
added
the
king
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
the
others
*NL*
were
retiring
,
``
as
you
have
no
room
in
the
Musketeers
,
and
as
we
have
*NL*
besides
decided
that
a
novitiate
is
necessary
before
entering
that
*NL*
corps
,
place
this
young
man
in
the
company
of
the
Guards
of
Monsieur
*NL*
Dessessart
,
your
brother-in-law
.
Ah
,
PARDIEU
,
Treville
!
I
enjoy
*NL*
beforehand
the
face
the
cardinal
will
make
.
He
will
be
furious
;
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
.
I
am
doing
what
is
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
waved
his
hand
to
Treville
,
who
left
him
and
rejoined
the
*NL*
Musketeers
,
whom
he
found
sharing
the
forty
pistoles
with
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
,
as
his
Majesty
had
said
,
was
really
furious
,
so
furious
*NL*
that
during
eight
days
he
absented
himself
from
the
king
's
gaming
table
.
*NL*
This
did
not
prevent
the
king
from
being
as
complacent
to
him
as
*NL*
possible
whenever
he
met
him
,
or
from
asking
in
the
kindest
tone
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Cardinal
,
how
fares
it
with
that
poor
Jussac
and
that
poor
*NL*
Bernajoux
of
yours
?

THE
INTERIOR
*
OF
THE
MUSKETEERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
d'Artagnan
was
out
of
the
Louvre
,
and
consulted
his
friends
upon
*NL*
the
use
he
had
best
make
of
his
share
of
the
forty
pistoles
,
Athos
*NL*
advised
him
to
order
a
good
repast
at
the
Pomme-de-Pin
,
Porthos
to
*NL*
engage
a
lackey
,
and
Aramis
to
provide
himself
with
a
suitable
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
*
Domestic
affairs
,
housekeeping
_
*NL*
*NL*
The
repast
was
carried
into
effect
that
very
day
,
and
the
lackey
waited
*NL*
at
table
.
The
repast
had
been
ordered
by
Athos
,
and
the
lackey
furnished
*NL*
by
Porthos
.
He
was
a
Picard
,
whom
the
glorious
Musketeer
had
picked
up
*NL*
on
the
Bridge
Tournelle
,
making
rings
and
plashing
in
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
pretended
that
this
occupation
was
proof
of
a
reflective
and
*NL*
contemplative
organization
,
and
he
had
brought
him
away
without
any
*NL*
other
recommendation
.
The
noble
carriage
of
this
gentleman
,
for
whom
he
*NL*
believed
himself
to
be
engaged
,
had
won
Planchet
--
that
was
the
name
of
*NL*
the
Picard
.
He
felt
a
slight
disappointment
,
however
,
when
he
saw
that
*NL*
this
place
was
already
taken
by
a
compeer
named
Mousqueton
,
and
when
*NL*
Porthos
signified
to
him
that
the
state
of
his
household
,
though
great
,
*NL*
would
not
support
two
servants
,
and
that
he
must
enter
into
the
service
*NL*
of
d'Artagnan
.
Nevertheless
,
when
he
waited
at
the
dinner
given
by
his
*NL*
master
,
and
saw
him
take
out
a
handful
of
gold
to
pay
for
it
,
he
*NL*
believed
his
fortune
made
,
and
returned
thanks
to
heaven
for
having
*NL*
thrown
him
into
the
service
of
such
a
Croesus
.
He
preserved
this
opinion
*NL*
even
after
the
feast
,
with
the
remnants
of
which
he
repaired
his
own
*NL*
long
abstinence
;
but
when
in
the
evening
he
made
his
master
's
bed
,
the
*NL*
chimeras
of
Planchet
faded
away
.
The
bed
was
the
only
one
in
the
*NL*
apartment
,
which
consisted
of
an
antechamber
and
a
bedroom
.
Planchet
*NL*
slept
in
the
antechamber
upon
a
coverlet
taken
from
the
bed
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
and
which
d'Artagnan
from
that
time
made
shift
to
do
*NL*
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
on
his
part
,
had
a
valet
whom
he
had
trained
in
his
service
in
a
*NL*
thoroughly
peculiar
fashion
,
and
who
was
named
Grimaud
.
He
was
very
*NL*
taciturn
,
this
worthy
signor
.
Be
it
understood
we
are
speaking
of
Athos
.
*NL*
During
the
five
or
six
years
that
he
had
lived
in
the
strictest
intimacy
*NL*
with
his
companions
,
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
they
could
remember
having
*NL*
often
seen
him
smile
,
but
had
never
heard
him
laugh
.
His
words
were
*NL*
brief
and
expressive
,
conveying
all
that
was
meant
,
and
no
more
;
no
*NL*
embellishments
,
no
embroidery
,
no
arabesques
.
His
conversation
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
without
a
single
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Athos
was
scarcely
thirty
years
old
,
and
was
of
great
personal
*NL*
beauty
and
intelligence
of
mind
,
no
one
knew
whether
he
had
ever
had
a
*NL*
mistress
.
He
never
spoke
of
women
.
He
certainly
did
not
prevent
others
*NL*
from
speaking
of
them
before
him
,
although
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
*NL*
this
kind
of
conversation
,
in
which
he
only
mingled
by
bitter
words
and
*NL*
misanthropic
remarks
,
was
very
disagreeable
to
him
.
His
reserve
,
his
*NL*
roughness
,
and
his
silence
made
almost
an
old
man
of
him
.
He
had
,
then
,
*NL*
in
order
not
to
disturb
his
habits
,
accustomed
Grimaud
to
obey
him
upon
*NL*
a
simple
gesture
or
upon
a
simple
movement
of
his
lips
.
He
never
spoke
*NL*
to
him
,
except
under
the
most
extraordinary
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
Grimaud
,
who
feared
his
master
as
he
did
fire
,
while
*NL*
entertaining
a
strong
attachment
to
his
person
and
a
great
veneration
*NL*
for
his
talents
,
believed
he
perfectly
understood
what
he
wanted
,
flew
*NL*
to
execute
the
order
received
,
and
did
precisely
the
contrary
.
Athos
*NL*
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
,
without
putting
himself
in
a
passion
,
*NL*
thrashed
Grimaud
.
On
these
days
he
spoke
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
as
we
have
seen
,
had
a
character
exactly
opposite
to
that
of
*NL*
Athos
.
He
not
only
talked
much
,
but
he
talked
loudly
,
little
caring
,
we
*NL*
must
render
him
that
justice
,
whether
anybody
listened
to
him
or
not
.
He
*NL*
talked
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
and
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
*NL*
himself
talk
.
He
spoke
upon
all
subjects
except
the
sciences
,
alleging
*NL*
in
this
respect
the
inveterate
hatred
he
had
borne
to
scholars
from
his
*NL*
childhood
.
He
had
not
so
noble
an
air
as
Athos
,
and
the
commencement
of
*NL*
their
intimacy
often
rendered
him
unjust
toward
that
gentleman
,
whom
he
*NL*
endeavored
to
eclipse
by
his
splendid
dress
.
But
with
his
simple
*NL*
Musketeer
's
uniform
and
nothing
but
the
manner
in
which
he
threw
back
*NL*
his
head
and
advanced
his
foot
,
Athos
instantly
took
the
place
which
was
*NL*
his
due
and
consigned
the
ostentatious
Porthos
to
the
second
rank
.
*NL*
Porthos
consoled
himself
by
filling
the
antechamber
of
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
and
the
guardroom
of
the
Louvre
with
the
accounts
of
his
love
scrapes
,
*NL*
after
having
passed
from
professional
ladies
to
military
ladies
,
from
*NL*
the
lawyer
's
dame
to
the
baroness
,
there
was
question
of
nothing
less
*NL*
with
Porthos
than
a
foreign
princess
,
who
was
enormously
fond
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
proverb
says
,
``
Like
master
,
like
man
.
''
Let
us
pass
,
then
,
from
*NL*
the
valet
of
Athos
to
the
valet
of
Porthos
,
from
Grimaud
to
Mousqueton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mousqueton
was
a
Norman
,
whose
pacific
name
of
Boniface
his
master
had
*NL*
changed
into
the
infinitely
more
sonorous
name
of
Mousqueton
.
He
had
*NL*
entered
the
service
of
Porthos
upon
condition
that
he
should
only
be
*NL*
clothed
and
lodged
,
though
in
a
handsome
manner
;
but
he
claimed
two
*NL*
hours
a
day
to
himself
,
consecrated
to
an
employment
which
would
provide
*NL*
for
his
other
wants
.
Porthos
agreed
to
the
bargain
;
the
thing
suited
him
*NL*
wonderfully
well
.
He
had
doublets
cut
out
of
his
old
clothes
and
*NL*
cast-off
cloaks
for
Mousqueton
,
and
thanks
to
a
very
intelligent
tailor
,
*NL*
who
made
his
clothes
look
as
good
as
new
by
turning
them
,
and
whose
wife
*NL*
was
suspected
of
wishing
to
make
Porthos
descend
from
his
aristocratic
*NL*
habits
,
Mousqueton
made
a
very
good
figure
when
attending
on
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Aramis
,
of
whom
we
believe
we
have
sufficiently
explained
the
*NL*
character
--
a
character
which
,
like
that
of
his
companions
,
we
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
follow
in
its
development
--
his
lackey
was
called
Bazin
.
Thanks
*NL*
to
the
hopes
which
his
master
entertained
of
someday
entering
into
*NL*
orders
,
he
was
always
clothed
in
black
,
as
became
the
servant
of
a
*NL*
churchman
.
He
was
a
Berrichon
,
thirty-five
or
forty
years
old
,
mild
,
*NL*
peaceable
,
sleek
,
employing
the
leisure
his
master
left
him
in
the
*NL*
perusal
of
pious
works
,
providing
rigorously
for
two
a
dinner
of
few
*NL*
dishes
,
but
excellent
.
For
the
rest
,
he
was
dumb
,
blind
,
and
deaf
,
and
*NL*
of
unimpeachable
fidelity
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
that
we
are
acquainted
,
superficially
at
least
,
with
the
masters
*NL*
and
the
valets
,
let
us
pass
on
to
the
dwellings
occupied
by
each
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
dwelt
in
the
Rue
Ferou
,
within
two
steps
of
the
Luxembourg
.
His
*NL*
apartment
consisted
of
two
small
chambers
,
very
nicely
fitted
up
,
in
a
*NL*
furnished
house
,
the
hostess
of
which
,
still
young
and
still
really
*NL*
handsome
,
cast
tender
glances
uselessly
at
him
.
Some
fragments
of
past
*NL*
splendor
appeared
here
and
there
upon
the
walls
of
this
modest
lodging
;
*NL*
a
sword
,
for
example
,
richly
embossed
,
which
belonged
by
its
make
to
the
*NL*
times
of
Francis
I
,
the
hilt
of
which
alone
,
encrusted
with
precious
*NL*
stones
,
might
be
worth
two
hundred
pistoles
,
and
which
,
nevertheless
,
in
*NL*
his
moments
of
greatest
distress
Athos
had
never
pledged
or
offered
for
*NL*
sale
.
It
had
long
been
an
object
of
ambition
for
Porthos
.
Porthos
would
*NL*
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
to
possess
this
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
he
had
an
appointment
with
a
duchess
,
he
endeavored
even
*NL*
to
borrow
it
of
Athos
.
Athos
,
without
saying
anything
,
emptied
his
*NL*
pockets
,
got
together
all
his
jewels
,
purses
,
aiguillettes
,
and
gold
*NL*
chains
,
and
offered
them
all
to
Porthos
;
but
as
to
the
sword
,
he
said
it
*NL*
was
sealed
to
its
place
and
should
never
quit
it
until
its
master
should
*NL*
himself
quit
his
lodgings
.
In
addition
to
the
sword
,
there
was
a
*NL*
portrait
representing
a
nobleman
of
the
time
of
Henry
III
,
dressed
with
*NL*
the
greatest
elegance
,
and
who
wore
the
Order
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
and
*NL*
this
portrait
had
certain
resemblances
of
lines
with
Athos
,
certain
*NL*
family
likenesses
which
indicated
that
this
great
noble
,
a
knight
of
the
*NL*
Order
of
the
King
,
was
his
ancestor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
these
,
a
casket
of
magnificent
goldwork
,
with
the
same
arms
as
*NL*
the
sword
and
the
portrait
,
formed
a
middle
ornament
to
the
mantelpiece
,
*NL*
and
assorted
badly
with
the
rest
of
the
furniture
.
Athos
always
carried
*NL*
the
key
of
this
coffer
about
him
;
but
he
one
day
opened
it
before
*NL*
Porthos
,
and
Porthos
was
convinced
that
this
coffer
contained
nothing
*NL*
but
letters
and
papers
--
love
letters
and
family
papers
,
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
lived
in
an
apartment
,
large
in
size
and
of
very
sumptuous
*NL*
appearance
,
in
the
Rue
du
Vieux-Colombier
.
Every
time
he
passed
with
a
*NL*
friend
before
his
windows
,
at
one
of
which
Mousqueton
was
sure
to
be
*NL*
placed
in
full
livery
,
Porthos
raised
his
head
and
his
hand
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
That
is
my
abode
!
''
But
he
was
never
to
be
found
at
home
;
he
never
*NL*
invited
anybody
to
go
up
with
him
,
and
no
one
could
form
an
idea
of
what
*NL*
his
sumptuous
apartment
contained
in
the
shape
of
real
riches
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Aramis
,
he
dwelt
in
a
little
lodging
composed
of
a
boudoir
,
an
*NL*
eating
room
,
and
a
bedroom
,
which
room
,
situated
,
as
the
others
were
,
on
*NL*
the
ground
floor
,
looked
out
upon
a
little
fresh
green
garden
,
shady
and
*NL*
impenetrable
to
the
eyes
of
his
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
d'Artagnan
,
we
know
how
he
was
lodged
,
and
we
have
*NL*
already
made
acquaintance
with
his
lackey
,
Master
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
was
by
nature
very
curious
--
as
people
generally
are
who
*NL*
possess
the
genius
of
intrigue
--
did
all
he
could
to
make
out
who
Athos
,
*NL*
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
really
were
-LRB-
for
under
these
pseudonyms
each
of
*NL*
these
young
men
concealed
his
family
name
-RRB-
--
Athos
in
particular
,
who
,
a
*NL*
league
away
,
savored
of
nobility
.
He
addressed
himself
then
to
Porthos
*NL*
to
gain
information
respecting
Athos
and
Aramis
,
and
to
Aramis
in
order
*NL*
to
learn
something
of
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
Porthos
knew
nothing
of
the
life
of
his
silent
companion
*NL*
but
what
revealed
itself
.
It
was
said
Athos
had
met
with
great
crosses
*NL*
in
love
,
and
that
a
frightful
treachery
had
forever
poisoned
the
life
of
*NL*
this
gallant
man
.
What
could
this
treachery
be
?
All
the
world
was
*NL*
ignorant
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Porthos
,
except
his
real
name
-LRB-
as
was
the
case
with
those
of
his
*NL*
two
comrades
-RRB-
,
his
life
was
very
easily
known
.
Vain
and
indiscreet
,
it
*NL*
was
as
easy
to
see
through
him
as
through
a
crystal
.
The
only
thing
to
*NL*
mislead
the
investigator
would
have
been
belief
in
all
the
good
things
*NL*
he
said
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
respect
to
Aramis
,
though
having
the
air
of
having
nothing
secret
*NL*
about
him
,
he
was
a
young
fellow
made
up
of
mysteries
,
answering
little
*NL*
to
questions
put
to
him
about
others
,
and
having
learned
from
him
the
*NL*
report
which
prevailed
concerning
the
success
of
the
Musketeer
with
a
*NL*
princess
,
wished
to
gain
a
little
insight
into
the
amorous
adventures
of
*NL*
his
interlocutor
.
``
And
you
,
my
dear
companion
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
speak
of
*NL*
the
baronesses
,
countesses
,
and
princesses
of
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARDIEU
!
I
spoke
of
them
because
Porthos
talked
of
them
himself
,
*NL*
because
he
had
paraded
all
these
fine
things
before
me
.
But
be
assured
,
*NL*
my
dear
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
,
that
if
I
had
obtained
them
from
any
other
*NL*
source
,
or
if
they
had
been
confided
to
me
,
there
exists
no
confessor
*NL*
more
discreet
than
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
doubt
that
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
it
seems
to
me
that
*NL*
you
are
tolerably
familiar
with
coats
of
arms
--
a
certain
embroidered
*NL*
handkerchief
,
for
instance
,
to
which
I
owe
the
honor
of
your
*NL*
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Aramis
was
not
angry
,
but
assumed
the
most
modest
air
and
*NL*
replied
in
a
friendly
tone
,
``
My
dear
friend
,
do
not
forget
that
I
wish
*NL*
to
belong
to
the
Church
,
and
that
I
avoid
all
mundane
opportunities
.
The
*NL*
handkerchief
you
saw
had
not
been
given
to
me
,
but
it
had
been
forgotten
*NL*
and
left
at
my
house
by
one
of
my
friends
.
I
was
obliged
to
pick
it
up
*NL*
in
order
not
to
compromise
him
and
the
lady
he
loves
.
As
for
myself
,
I
*NL*
neither
have
,
nor
desire
to
have
,
a
mistress
,
following
in
that
respect
*NL*
the
very
judicious
example
of
Athos
,
who
has
none
any
more
than
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
the
devil
!
You
are
not
a
priest
,
you
are
a
Musketeer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Musketeer
for
a
time
,
my
friend
,
as
the
cardinal
says
,
a
Musketeer
*NL*
against
my
will
,
but
a
churchman
at
heart
,
believe
me
.
Athos
and
Porthos
*NL*
dragged
me
into
this
to
occupy
me
.
I
had
,
at
the
moment
of
being
*NL*
ordained
,
a
little
difficulty
with
--
But
that
would
not
interest
you
,
and
*NL*
I
am
taking
up
your
valuable
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
it
interests
me
very
much
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
at
this
*NL*
moment
I
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
have
my
breviary
to
repeat
,
''
answered
Aramis
;
``
then
some
*NL*
verses
to
compose
,
which
Madame
d'Aiguillon
begged
of
me
.
Then
I
must
go
*NL*
to
the
Rue
St.
Honore
in
order
to
purchase
some
rouge
for
Madame
de
*NL*
Chevreuse
.
So
you
see
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
if
you
are
not
in
a
hurry
,
I
*NL*
am
very
much
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
held
out
his
hand
in
a
cordial
manner
to
his
young
companion
,
and
*NL*
took
leave
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
all
the
pains
he
took
,
d'Artagnan
was
unable
to
learn
*NL*
any
more
concerning
his
three
new-made
friends
.
He
formed
,
therefore
,
*NL*
the
resolution
of
believing
for
the
present
all
that
was
said
of
their
*NL*
past
,
hoping
for
more
certain
and
extended
revelations
in
the
future
.
In
*NL*
the
meanwhile
,
he
looked
upon
Athos
as
an
Achilles
,
Porthos
as
an
Ajax
,
*NL*
and
Aramis
as
a
Joseph
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
rest
,
the
life
of
the
four
young
friends
was
joyous
enough
.
*NL*
Athos
played
,
and
that
as
a
rule
unfortunately
.
Nevertheless
,
he
never
*NL*
borrowed
a
sou
of
his
companions
,
although
his
purse
was
ever
at
their
*NL*
service
;
and
when
he
had
played
upon
honor
,
he
always
awakened
his
*NL*
creditor
by
six
o'clock
the
next
morning
to
pay
the
debt
of
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
had
his
fits
.
On
the
days
when
he
won
he
was
insolent
and
*NL*
ostentatious
;
if
he
lost
,
he
disappeared
completely
for
several
days
,
*NL*
after
which
he
reappeared
with
a
pale
face
and
thinner
person
,
but
with
*NL*
money
in
his
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Aramis
,
he
never
played
.
He
was
the
worst
Musketeer
and
the
most
*NL*
unconvivial
companion
imaginable
.
He
had
always
something
or
other
to
*NL*
do
.
Sometimes
in
the
midst
of
dinner
,
when
everyone
,
under
the
*NL*
attraction
of
wine
and
in
the
warmth
of
conversation
,
believed
they
had
*NL*
two
or
three
hours
longer
to
enjoy
themselves
at
table
,
Aramis
looked
at
*NL*
his
watch
,
arose
with
a
bland
smile
,
and
took
leave
of
the
company
,
to
*NL*
go
,
as
he
said
,
to
consult
a
casuist
with
whom
he
had
an
appointment
.
At
*NL*
other
times
he
would
return
home
to
write
a
treatise
,
and
requested
his
*NL*
friends
not
to
disturb
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Athos
would
smile
,
with
his
charming
,
melancholy
smile
,
which
so
*NL*
became
his
noble
countenance
,
and
Porthos
would
drink
,
swearing
that
*NL*
Aramis
would
never
be
anything
but
a
village
CURE
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
,
d'Artagnan
's
valet
,
supported
his
good
fortune
nobly
.
He
*NL*
received
thirty
sous
per
day
,
and
for
a
month
he
returned
to
his
*NL*
lodgings
gay
as
a
chaffinch
,
and
affable
toward
his
master
.
When
the
*NL*
wind
of
adversity
began
to
blow
upon
the
housekeeping
of
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Fossoyeurs
--
that
is
to
say
,
when
the
forty
pistoles
of
King
Louis
XIII
*NL*
were
consumed
or
nearly
so
--
he
commenced
complaints
which
Athos
thought
*NL*
nauseous
,
Porthos
indecent
,
and
Aramis
ridiculous
.
Athos
counseled
*NL*
d'Artagnan
to
dismiss
the
fellow
;
Porthos
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
*NL*
should
give
him
a
good
thrashing
first
;
and
Aramis
contended
that
a
*NL*
master
should
never
attend
to
anything
but
the
civilities
paid
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
very
easy
for
you
to
say
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
for
you
,
*NL*
Athos
,
who
live
like
a
dumb
man
with
Grimaud
,
who
forbid
him
to
speak
,
*NL*
and
consequently
never
exchange
ill
words
with
him
;
for
you
,
Porthos
,
*NL*
who
carry
matters
in
such
a
magnificent
style
,
and
are
a
god
to
your
*NL*
valet
,
Mousqueton
;
and
for
you
,
Aramis
,
who
,
always
abstracted
by
your
*NL*
theological
studies
,
inspire
your
servant
,
Bazin
,
a
mild
,
religious
man
,
*NL*
with
a
profound
respect
;
but
for
me
,
who
am
without
any
settled
means
*NL*
and
without
resources
--
for
me
,
who
am
neither
a
Musketeer
nor
even
a
*NL*
Guardsman
,
what
am
I
to
do
to
inspire
either
the
affection
,
the
terror
,
*NL*
or
the
respect
in
Planchet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
serious
,
''
answered
the
three
friends
;
``
it
is
a
family
affair
.
*NL*
It
is
with
valets
as
with
wives
,
they
must
be
placed
at
once
upon
the
*NL*
footing
in
which
you
wish
them
to
remain
.
Reflect
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
reflect
,
and
resolved
to
thrash
Planchet
provisionally
;
*NL*
which
he
did
with
the
conscientiousness
that
d'Artagnan
carried
into
*NL*
everything
.
After
having
well
beaten
him
,
he
forbade
him
to
leave
his
*NL*
service
without
his
permission
.
``
For
,
''
added
he
,
``
the
future
can
not
fail
*NL*
to
mend
;
I
inevitably
look
for
better
times
.
Your
fortune
is
therefore
*NL*
made
if
you
remain
with
me
,
and
I
am
too
good
a
master
to
allow
you
to
*NL*
miss
such
a
chance
by
granting
you
the
dismissal
you
require
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
manner
of
acting
roused
much
respect
for
d'Artagnan
's
policy
among
*NL*
the
Musketeers
.
Planchet
was
equally
seized
with
admiration
,
and
said
no
*NL*
more
about
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
of
the
four
young
men
had
become
fraternal
.
D'Artagnan
,
who
had
*NL*
no
settled
habits
of
his
own
,
as
he
came
from
his
province
into
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
world
quite
new
to
him
,
fell
easily
into
the
habits
of
his
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
rose
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
winter
,
about
six
in
summer
,
and
*NL*
went
to
take
the
countersign
and
see
how
things
went
on
at
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
's
.
D'Artagnan
,
although
he
was
not
a
Musketeer
,
performed
the
*NL*
duty
of
one
with
remarkable
punctuality
.
He
went
on
guard
because
he
*NL*
always
kept
company
with
whoever
of
his
friends
was
on
duty
.
He
was
well
*NL*
known
at
the
Hotel
of
the
Musketeers
,
where
everyone
considered
him
a
*NL*
good
comrade
.
M.
de
Treville
,
who
had
appreciated
him
at
the
first
*NL*
glance
and
who
bore
him
a
real
affection
,
never
ceased
recommending
him
*NL*
to
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
side
,
the
three
Musketeers
were
much
attached
to
their
young
*NL*
comrade
.
The
friendship
which
united
these
four
men
,
and
the
need
they
*NL*
felt
of
seeing
another
three
or
four
times
a
day
,
whether
for
dueling
,
*NL*
business
,
or
pleasure
,
caused
them
to
be
continually
running
after
one
*NL*
another
like
shadows
;
and
the
Inseparables
were
constantly
to
be
met
*NL*
with
seeking
one
another
,
from
the
Luxembourg
to
the
Place
St.
Sulpice
,
*NL*
or
from
the
Rue
du
Vieux-Colombier
to
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
the
promises
of
M.
de
Treville
went
on
prosperously
.
*NL*
One
fine
morning
the
king
commanded
M.
de
Chevalier
Dessessart
to
admit
*NL*
d'Artagnan
as
a
cadet
in
his
company
of
Guards
.
D'Artagnan
,
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
donned
his
uniform
,
which
he
would
have
exchanged
for
that
of
a
*NL*
Musketeer
at
the
expense
of
ten
years
of
his
existence
.
But
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
promised
this
favor
after
a
novitiate
of
two
years
--
a
novitiate
*NL*
which
might
besides
be
abridged
if
an
opportunity
should
present
itself
*NL*
for
d'Artagnan
to
render
the
king
any
signal
service
,
or
to
distinguish
*NL*
himself
by
some
brilliant
action
.
Upon
this
promise
d'Artagnan
withdrew
,
*NL*
and
the
next
day
he
began
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
became
the
turn
of
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
to
mount
guard
*NL*
with
d'Artagnan
when
he
was
on
duty
.
The
company
of
M.
le
Chevalier
*NL*
Dessessart
thus
received
four
instead
of
one
when
it
admitted
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.

CONCERNING
A
COURT
INTRIGUE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
forty
pistoles
of
King
Louis
XIII
,
like
all
other
*NL*
things
of
this
world
,
after
having
had
a
beginning
had
an
end
,
and
after
*NL*
this
end
our
four
companions
began
to
be
somewhat
embarrassed
.
At
first
,
*NL*
Athos
supported
the
association
for
a
time
with
his
own
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
succeeded
him
;
and
thanks
to
one
of
those
disappearances
to
*NL*
which
he
was
accustomed
,
he
was
able
to
provide
for
the
wants
of
all
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
.
At
last
it
became
Aramis
's
turn
,
who
performed
it
with
a
*NL*
good
grace
and
who
succeeded
--
as
he
said
,
by
selling
some
theological
*NL*
books
--
in
procuring
a
few
pistoles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
they
had
been
accustomed
to
do
,
they
had
recourse
to
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
,
who
made
some
advances
on
their
pay
;
but
these
advances
could
*NL*
not
go
far
with
three
Musketeers
who
were
already
much
in
arrears
and
a
*NL*
Guardsman
who
as
yet
had
no
pay
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
when
they
found
they
were
likely
to
be
really
in
want
,
they
*NL*
got
together
,
as
a
last
effort
,
eight
or
ten
pistoles
,
with
which
*NL*
Porthos
went
to
the
gaming
table
.
Unfortunately
he
was
in
a
bad
vein
;
he
*NL*
lost
all
,
together
with
twenty-five
pistoles
for
which
he
had
given
his
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
inconvenience
became
distress
.
The
hungry
friends
,
followed
by
*NL*
their
lackeys
,
were
seen
haunting
the
quays
and
Guard
rooms
,
picking
up
*NL*
among
their
friends
abroad
all
the
dinners
they
could
meet
with
;
for
*NL*
according
to
the
advice
of
Aramis
,
it
was
prudent
to
sow
repasts
right
*NL*
and
left
in
prosperity
,
in
order
to
reap
a
few
in
time
of
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
was
invited
four
times
,
and
each
time
took
his
friends
and
their
*NL*
lackeys
with
him
.
Porthos
had
six
occasions
,
and
contrived
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
that
his
friends
should
partake
of
them
;
Aramis
had
eight
of
*NL*
them
.
He
was
a
man
,
as
must
have
been
already
perceived
,
who
made
but
*NL*
little
noise
,
and
yet
was
much
sought
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
who
as
yet
knew
nobody
in
the
capital
,
he
only
found
*NL*
one
chocolate
breakfast
at
the
house
of
a
priest
of
his
own
province
,
*NL*
and
one
dinner
at
the
house
of
a
cornet
of
the
Guards
.
He
took
his
army
*NL*
to
the
priest
's
,
where
they
devoured
as
much
provision
as
would
have
*NL*
lasted
him
for
two
months
,
and
to
the
cornet
's
,
who
performed
wonders
;
*NL*
but
as
Planchet
said
,
``
People
do
not
eat
at
once
for
all
time
,
even
when
*NL*
they
eat
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
thus
felt
himself
humiliated
in
having
only
procured
one
meal
*NL*
and
a
half
for
his
companions
--
as
the
breakfast
at
the
priest
's
could
*NL*
only
be
counted
as
half
a
repast
--
in
return
for
the
feasts
which
Athos
,
*NL*
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
had
procured
him
.
He
fancied
himself
a
burden
to
the
*NL*
society
,
forgetting
in
his
perfectly
juvenile
good
faith
that
he
had
fed
*NL*
this
society
for
a
month
;
and
he
set
his
mind
actively
to
work
.
He
*NL*
reflected
that
this
coalition
of
four
young
,
brave
,
enterprising
,
and
*NL*
active
men
ought
to
have
some
other
object
than
swaggering
walks
,
*NL*
fencing
lessons
,
and
practical
jokes
,
more
or
less
witty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
four
men
such
as
they
were
--
four
men
devoted
to
one
another
,
*NL*
from
their
purses
to
their
lives
;
four
men
always
supporting
one
*NL*
another
,
never
yielding
,
executing
singly
or
together
the
resolutions
*NL*
formed
in
common
;
four
arms
threatening
the
four
cardinal
points
,
or
*NL*
turning
toward
a
single
point
--
must
inevitably
,
either
subterraneously
,
*NL*
in
open
day
,
by
mining
,
in
the
trench
,
by
cunning
,
or
by
force
,
open
*NL*
themselves
a
way
toward
the
object
they
wished
to
attain
,
however
well
*NL*
it
might
be
defended
,
or
however
distant
it
may
seem
.
The
only
thing
*NL*
that
astonished
d'Artagnan
was
that
his
friends
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
by
himself
,
and
even
seriously
racking
his
brain
to
find
*NL*
a
direction
for
this
single
force
four
times
multiplied
,
with
which
he
*NL*
did
not
doubt
,
as
with
the
lever
for
which
Archimedes
sought
,
they
*NL*
should
succeed
in
moving
the
world
,
when
someone
tapped
gently
at
his
*NL*
door
.
D'Artagnan
awakened
Planchet
and
ordered
him
to
open
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
phrase
,
``
d'Artagnan
awakened
Planchet
,
''
the
reader
must
not
*NL*
suppose
it
was
night
,
or
that
day
was
hardly
come
.
No
,
it
had
just
*NL*
struck
four
.
Planchet
,
two
hours
before
,
had
asked
his
master
for
some
*NL*
dinner
,
and
he
had
answered
him
with
the
proverb
,
``
He
who
sleeps
,
*NL*
dines
.
''
And
Planchet
dined
by
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
was
introduced
of
simple
mien
,
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
*NL*
tradesman
.
Planchet
,
by
way
of
dessert
,
would
have
liked
to
hear
the
*NL*
conversation
;
but
the
citizen
declared
to
d'Artagnan
that
,
what
he
had
*NL*
to
say
being
important
and
confidential
,
he
desired
to
be
left
alone
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
dismissed
Planchet
,
and
requested
his
visitor
to
be
seated
.
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
silence
,
during
which
the
two
men
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
,
as
if
to
make
a
preliminary
acquaintance
,
after
which
d'Artagnan
*NL*
bowed
,
as
a
sign
that
he
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
spoken
of
as
a
very
brave
young
man
,
''
*NL*
said
the
citizen
;
``
and
this
reputation
which
he
justly
enjoys
had
*NL*
decided
me
to
confide
a
secret
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
monsieur
,
speak
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
instinctively
scented
*NL*
something
advantageous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
citizen
made
a
fresh
pause
and
continued
,
``
I
have
a
wife
who
is
*NL*
seamstress
to
the
queen
,
monsieur
,
and
who
is
not
deficient
in
either
*NL*
virtue
or
beauty
.
I
was
induced
to
marry
her
about
three
years
ago
,
*NL*
although
she
had
but
very
little
dowry
,
because
Monsieur
Laporte
,
the
*NL*
queen
's
cloak
bearer
,
is
her
godfather
,
and
befriends
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

monsieur
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
resumed
the
citizen
,
``
well

monsieur

wife
was
abducted

yesterday
morning

coming
out

And

the

all
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
love
than
politics

replied
d'Artagnan
,
with
a
reflective
air
;
*NL*
``

what
do
you
suspect

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*

nothing

*NL*

that
it

intrigues

amours

Bois-Tracy

*NL*
said
d'Artagnan
,
wishing
to
have
the
air

in
the
eyes
of
the
citizen

of
*NL*
being
posted
as
to
court
affairs

the

low

``

In

a
cloak

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

cried
d'Artagnan

the

at

each
*NL*
having
recognized
his
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

time

cried
d'Artagnan
,
springing
to
his
sword
,
``
this
time
he
*NL*
will
not
escape
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drawing
his
sword
from
its
scabbard
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
apartment
.
On
*NL*
the
staircase
he
met
Athos
and
Porthos
,
who
were
coming
to
see
him
.
They
*NL*
separated
,
and
d'Artagnan
rushed
between
them
like
a
dart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pah
!
Where
are
you
going

cried
the
two
Musketeers
in
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
of
Meung
!
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
more
than
once
related
to
his
friends
his
adventure
with
*NL*
the
stranger
,
as
well
as
the
apparition
of
the
beautiful
foreigner
,
to
*NL*
whom
this
man
had
confided
some
important
missive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
opinion
of
Athos
was
that
d'Artagnan
had
lost
his
letter
in
the
*NL*
skirmish
.
A
gentleman
,
in
his
opinion
--
and
according
to
d'Artagnan
's
*NL*
portrait
of
him
,
the
stranger
must
be
a
gentleman
--
would
be
incapable
of
*NL*
the
baseness
of
stealing
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
saw
nothing
in
all
this
but
a
love
meeting
,
given
by
a
lady
to
a
*NL*
cavalier
,
or
by
a
cavalier
to
a
lady
,
which
had
been
disturbed
by
the
*NL*
presence
of
d'Artagnan
and
his
yellow
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
said
that
as
these
sorts
of
affairs
were
mysterious
,
it
was
*NL*
better
not
to
fathom
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
understood
,
then
,
from
the
few
words
which
escaped
from
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
what
affair
was
in
hand
,
and
as
they
thought
that
overtaking
his
man
,
or
*NL*
losing
sight
of
him
,
d'Artagnan
would
return
to
his
rooms
,
they
kept
on
*NL*
their
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
d'Artagnan
's
chamber
,
it
was
empty
;
the
landlord
,
*NL*
dreading
the
consequences
of
the
encounter
which
was
doubtless
about
to
*NL*
take
place
between
the
young
man
and
the
stranger
,
had
,
consistent
with
*NL*
the
character
he
had
given
himself
,
judged
it
prudent
to
decamp

D'ARTAGNAN
SHOWS
HIMSELF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Athos
and
Porthos
had
foreseen
,
at
the
expiration
of
a
half
hour
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
returned
.
He
had
again
missed
his
man
,
who
had
disappeared
as
*NL*
if
by
enchantment
.
D'Artagnan
had
run
,
sword
in
hand
,
through
all
the
*NL*
neighboring
streets
,
but
had
found
nobody
resembling
the
man
he
sought
*NL*
for
.
Then
he
came
back
to
the
point
where
,
perhaps
,
he
ought
to
have
*NL*
begun
,
and
that
was
to
knock
at
the
door
against
which
the
stranger
had
*NL*
leaned
;
but
this
proved
useless
--
for
though
he
knocked
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
times
in
succession
,
no
one
answered
,
and
some
of
the
neighbors
,
who
put
*NL*
their
noses
out
of
their
windows
or
were
brought
to
their
doors
by
the
*NL*
noise
,
had
assured
him
that
that
house
,
all
the
openings
of
which
were
*NL*
tightly
closed
,
had
not
been
inhabited
for
six
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
d'Artagnan
was
running
through
the
streets
and
knocking
at
doors
,
*NL*
Aramis
had
joined
his
companions
;
so
that
on
returning
home
d'Artagnan
*NL*
found
the
reunion
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
the
three
Musketeers
all
together
,
on
seeing
d'Artagnan
*NL*
enter
with
his
brow
covered
with
perspiration
and
his
countenance
upset
*NL*
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
he
,
throwing
his
sword
upon
the
bed
,
``
this
man
must
be
the
*NL*
devil
in
person
;
he
has
disappeared
like
a
phantom
,
like
a
shade
,
like
a
*NL*
specter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
in
apparitions
?
''
asked
Athos
of
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
believe
in
anything
I
have
not
seen
,
and
as
I
never
have
seen
*NL*
apparitions
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Bible
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
makes
our
belief
in
them
a
law
;
the
ghost
of
*NL*
Samuel
appeared
to
Saul
,
and
it
is
an
article
of
faith
that
I
should
be
*NL*
very
sorry
to
see
any
doubt
thrown
upon
,
Porthos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
man
or
devil
,
body
or
shadow
,
illusion
or
reality
,
this
*NL*
man
is
born
for
my
damnation
;
for
his
flight
has
caused
us
to
miss
a
*NL*
glorious
affair
,
gentlemen
--
an
affair
by
which
there
were
a
hundred
*NL*
pistoles
,
and
perhaps
more
,
to
be
gained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
''
cried
Porthos
and
Aramis
in
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Athos
,
faithful
to
his
system
of
reticence
,
he
contented
himself
*NL*
with
interrogating
d'Artagnan
by
a
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
his
domestic
,
who
just
then
insinuated
*NL*
his
head
through
the
half-open
door
in
order
to
catch
some
fragments
of
*NL*
the
conversation
,
``
go
down
to
my
landlord
,
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
and
ask
*NL*
him
to
send
me
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
Beaugency
wine
;
I
prefer
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
You
have
credit
with
your
landlord
,
then
?
''
asked
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
from
this
very
day
;
and
mind
,
if
the
wine
is
*NL*
bad
,
we
will
send
him
to
find
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
use
,
and
not
abuse
,
''
said
Aramis
,
sententiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
said
that
d'Artagnan
had
the
longest
head
of
the
four
,
''
said
*NL*
Athos
,
who
,
having
uttered
his
opinion
,
to
which
d'Artagnan
replied
with
*NL*
a
bow
,
immediately
resumed
his
accustomed
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
come
,
what
is
this
about
?
''
asked
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
impart
it
to
us
,
my
dear
friend
,
unless
the
honor
*NL*
of
any
lady
be
hazarded
by
this
confidence
;
in
that
case
you
would
do
*NL*
better
to
keep
it
to
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
the
honor
of
no
one
will
have
cause
*NL*
to
complain
of
what
I
have
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
related
to
his
friends
,
word
for
word
,
all
that
had
passed
*NL*
between
him
and
his
host
,
and
how
the
man
who
had
abducted
the
wife
of
*NL*
his
worthy
landlord
was
the
same
with
whom
he
had
had
the
difference
at
*NL*
the
hostelry
of
the
Jolly
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
affair
is
not
bad
,
''
said
Athos
,
after
having
tasted
like
a
*NL*
connoisseur
and
indicated
by
a
nod
of
his
head
that
he
thought
the
wine
*NL*
good
;
``
and
one
may
draw
fifty
or
sixty
pistoles
from
this
good
man
.
Then
*NL*
there
only
remains
to
ascertain
whether
these
fifty
or
sixty
pistoles
*NL*
are
worth
the
risk
of
four
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
observe
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
that
there
is
a
woman
in
the
affair
--
a
*NL*
woman
carried
off
,
a
woman
who
is
doubtless
threatened
,
tortured
*NL*
perhaps
,
and
all
because
she
is
faithful
to
her
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
,
d'Artagnan
,
beware
,
''
said
Aramis
.
``
You
grow
a
little
too
warm
,
*NL*
in
my
opinion
,
about
the
fate
of
Madame
Bonacieux

Woman
was
created
for
*NL*
our
destruction
,
and
it
is
from
her
we
inherit
all
our
miseries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
speech
of
Aramis
,
the
brow
of
Athos
became
clouded
and
he
bit
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
Madame
Bonacieux
about
whom
I
am
anxious
,

cried
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
``
but
the
queen
,
whom
the
king
abandons

whom
the
cardinal
persecutes

heads

all
her
friends
fall

one
after
the
other

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Spaniards

the
*NL*
English

*NL*
*NL*
``
Spain
is
her
country

replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
it
is
very
natural
that
*NL*
she
should
love
the
Spanish

who
are
the
children

herself

As
to
the
second
reproach

I
have
heard
it
said
that
she

not

*NL*
``
Well

Athos

it
must

a

scabbard

At
this

the
four

seeing
four
Musketeers
standing

their
swords
by

they
hesitated
about
going
farther

*NL*

d'Artagnan

in
a

rapid

low
tone

d'Artagnan

aloud

I

no

And
*NL*
d'Artagnan
pushed
the
half-stupefied

him

*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
were
full
of
thanks

and
took
away
their
prey
.
As
they
were
*NL*
going
down
d'Artagnan
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
their
leader

*NL*
``
May

d'Artagnan

filling
two
glasses
with
the
Beaugency
wine
which
he
had
obtained
from
*NL*
the
liberality
of
M.
Bonacieux

*NL*
*NL*

The
leader
of
the
posse
would
perhaps
have
doubted
the
sincerity
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
if
the
wine
had
been
bad

the
wine
was
good

convinced

Porthos

themselves
alone

congratulate
him
upon
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now

said
d'Artagnan
,
without
stopping
to
explain
his
*NL*
conduct
to
Porthos
,
``
All
for
one
,
one
for
all

that
is
our
motto

it

not

``

said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
out
your
hand

swear

cried
Athos
and
Aramis
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overcome
by
example
,
grumbling
to
himself
,
nevertheless
,
Porthos
*NL*
stretched
out
his
hand
,
and
the
four
friends
repeated
with
one
voice
the
*NL*
formula
dictated
by
d'Artagnan
:

*NL*
``
All
for
one

one
for
all

*NL*
``
That
's
well
!
Now
let
us
everyone
retire
to
his
own
home

said
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
but
command
all
his
life
;
``
and
*NL*
attention
!
For
from
this
moment
we
are
at
feud
with
the
cardinal

10
A
MOUSETRAP
IN
THE
SEVENTEENTH
CENTURY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
invention
of
the
mousetrap
does
not
date
from
our
days
;
as
soon
as
*NL*
societies
,
in
forming
,
had
invented
any
kind
of
police
,
that
police
*NL*
invented
mousetraps
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
perhaps
our
readers
are
not
familiar
with
the
slang
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Jerusalem
,
and
as
it
is
fifteen
years
since
we
applied
this
word
for
the
*NL*
first
time
to
this
thing
,
allow
us
to
explain
to
them
what
is
a
*NL*
mousetrap
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
in
a
house
,
of
whatever
kind
it
may
be
,
an
individual
suspected
of
*NL*
any
crime
is
arrested
,
the
arrest
is
held
secret
.
Four
or
five
men
are
*NL*
placed
in
ambuscade
in
the
first
room
.
The
door
is
opened
to
all
who
*NL*
knock
.
It
is
closed
after
them
,
and
they
are
arrested
;
so
that
at
the
*NL*
end
of
two
or
three
days
they
have
in
their
power
almost
all
the
*NL*
HABITUES
of
the
establishment
.
And
that
is
a
mousetrap
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
apartment
of
M.
Bonacieux
,
then
,
became
a
mousetrap
;
and
whoever
*NL*
appeared
there
was
taken
and
interrogated
by
the
cardinal
's
people
.
It
*NL*
must
be
observed
that
as
a
separate
passage
led
to
the
first
floor
,
in
*NL*
which
d'Artagnan
lodged
,
those
who
called
on
him
were
exempted
from
this
*NL*
detention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
nobody
came
thither
but
the
three
Musketeers
;
they
had
all
been
*NL*
engaged
in
earnest
search
and
inquiries
,
but
had
discovered
nothing
.
*NL*
Athos
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
question
M.
de
Treville
--
a
thing
which
,
*NL*
considering
the
habitual
reticence
of
the
worthy
Musketeer
,
had
very
*NL*
much
astonished
his
captain
.
But
M.
de
Treville
knew
nothing
,
except
*NL*
that
the
last
time
he
had
seen
the
cardinal
,
the
king
,
and
the
queen
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
looked
very
thoughtful
,
the
king
uneasy
,
and
the
redness
of
*NL*
the
queen
's
eyes
donated
that
she
had
been
sleepless
or
tearful
.
But
*NL*
this
last
circumstance
was
not
striking
,
as
the
queen
since
her
marriage
*NL*
had
slept
badly
and
wept
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
requested
Athos
,
whatever
might
happen
,
to
be
observant
of
*NL*
his
duty
to
the
king
,
but
particularly
to
the
queen
,
begging
him
to
*NL*
convey
his
desires
to
his
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
he
did
not
budge
from
his
apartment
.
He
converted
his
*NL*
chamber
into
an
observatory
.
From
his
windows
he
saw
all
the
visitors
*NL*
who
were
caught
.
Then
,
having
removed
a
plank
from
his
floor
,
and
*NL*
nothing
remaining
but
a
simple
ceiling
between
him
and
the
room
beneath
,
*NL*
in
which
the
interrogatories
were
made
,
he
heard
all
that
passed
between
*NL*
the
inquisitors
and
the
accused
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interrogatories
,
preceded
by
a
minute
search
operated
upon
the
*NL*
persons
arrested
,
were
almost
always
framed
thus
:
``
Has
Madame
Bonacieux
*NL*
sent
anything
to
you
for
her
husband
,
or
any
other
person
?
Has
Monsieur
*NL*
Bonacieux
sent
anything
to
you
for
his
wife
,
or
for
any
other
person
?
*NL*
Has
either
of
them
confided
anything
to
you
by
word
of
mouth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
knew
anything
,
they
would
not
question
people
in
this
manner
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
.
``
Now
,
what
is
it
they
want
to
know
?
Why
,
*NL*
they
want
to
know
if
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
is
in
Paris
,
and
if
he
has
*NL*
had
,
or
is
likely
to
have
,
an
interview
with
the
queen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
held
onto
this
idea
,
which
,
from
what
he
had
heard
,
was
not
*NL*
wanting
in
probability
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
mousetrap
continued
in
operation
,
and
likewise
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
vigilance
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
after
the
arrest
of
poor
Bonacieux
,
as
Athos
*NL*
had
just
left
d'Artagnan
to
report
at
M.
de
Treville
's
,
as
nine
o'clock
*NL*
had
just
struck
,
and
as
Planchet
,
who
had
not
yet
made
the
bed
,
was
*NL*
beginning
his
task
,
a
knocking
was
heard
at
the
street
door
.
The
door
*NL*
was
instantly
opened
and
shut
;
someone
was
taken
in
the
mousetrap
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
flew
to
his
hole
,
laid
himself
down
on
the
floor
at
full
*NL*
length
,
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cries
were
soon
heard
,
and
then
moans
,
which
someone
appeared
to
be
*NL*
endeavoring
to
stifle
.
There
were
no
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
.
``
It
seems
like
a
woman
!
They
*NL*
search
her
;
she
resists
;
they
use
force
--
the
scoundrels
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
prudence
,
d'Artagnan
restrained
himself
with
great
*NL*
difficulty
from
taking
a
part
in
the
scene
that
was
going
on
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
tell
you
that
I
am
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
gentlemen
!
I
tell
*NL*
you
I
am
Madame
Bonacieux
;
I
tell
you
I
belong
to
the
queen
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
unfortunate
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Bonacieux
!
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
``
Can
I
be
so
lucky
as
to
find
*NL*
what
everybody
is
seeking
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
became
more
and
more
indistinct
;
a
tumultuous
movement
shook
*NL*
the
partition
.
The
victim
resisted
as
much
as
a
woman
could
resist
four
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
gentlemen
--
par
--
''
murmured
the
voice
,
which
could
now
only
be
*NL*
heard
in
inarticulate
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
binding
her
;
they
are
going
to
drag
her
away
,
''
cried
*NL*
d'Artagnan
to
himself
,
springing
up
from
the
floor
.
``
My
sword
!
Good
,
it
*NL*
is
by
my
side
!
Planchet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
and
seek
Athos
,
Porthos
and
Aramis
.
One
of
the
three
will
certainly
*NL*
be
at
home
,
perhaps
all
three
.
Tell
them
to
take
arms
,
to
come
here
,
and
*NL*
to
run
!
Ah
,
I
remember
,
Athos
is
at
Monsieur
de
Treville
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
you
going
,
monsieur
,
where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
down
by
the
window
,
in
order
to
be
there
the
sooner
,
''
cried
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
``
You
put
back
the
boards
,
sweep
the
floor
,
go
out
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
run
as
I
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
monsieur
!
Monsieur
!
You
will
kill
yourself
,
''
cried
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
stupid
fellow
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
and
laying
hold
of
*NL*
the
casement
,
he
let
himself
gently
down
from
the
first
story
,
which
*NL*
fortunately
was
not
very
elevated
,
without
doing
himself
the
slightest
*NL*
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
straight
to
the
door
and
knocked
,
murmuring
,
``
I
will
go
*NL*
myself
and
be
caught
in
the
mousetrap
,
but
woe
be
to
the
cats
that
shall
*NL*
pounce
upon
such
a
mouse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
knocker
had
scarcely
sounded
under
the
hand
of
the
young
man
before
*NL*
the
tumult
ceased
,
steps
approached
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
sword
in
hand
,
rushed
into
the
rooms
of
M.
Bonacieux
,
the
*NL*
door
of
which
,
doubtless
acted
upon
by
a
spring
,
closed
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
those
who
dwelt
in
Bonacieux
's
unfortunate
house
,
together
with
the
*NL*
nearest
neighbors
,
heard
loud
cries
,
stamping
of
feet
,
clashing
of
*NL*
swords
,
and
breaking
of
furniture
.
A
moment
after
,
those
who
,
surprised
*NL*
by
this
tumult
,
had
gone
to
their
windows
to
learn
the
cause
of
it
,
saw
*NL*
the
door
open
,
and
four
men
,
clothed
in
black
,
not
COME
out
of
it
,
but
*NL*
FLY
,
like
so
many
frightened
crows
,
leaving
on
the
ground
and
on
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
furniture
,
feathers
from
their
wings
;
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
patches
of
their
clothes
and
fragments
of
their
cloaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
conqueror
--
without
much
effort
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
for
*NL*
only
one
of
the
officers
was
armed
,
and
even
he
defended
himself
for
*NL*
form
's
sake
.
It
is
true
that
the
three
others
had
endeavored
to
knock
*NL*
the
young
man
down
with
chairs
,
stools
,
and
crockery
;
but
two
or
three
*NL*
scratches
made
by
the
Gascon
's
blade
terrified
them
.
Ten
minutes
*NL*
sufficed
for
their
defeat
,
and
d'Artagnan
remained
master
of
the
field
*NL*
of
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbors
who
had
opened
their
windows
,
with
the
coolness
peculiar
*NL*
to
the
inhabitants
of
Paris
in
these
times
of
perpetual
riots
and
*NL*
disturbances
,
closed
them
again
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
four
men
in
*NL*
black
flee
--
their
instinct
telling
them
that
for
the
time
all
was
over
.
*NL*
Besides
,
it
began
to
grow
late
,
and
then
,
as
today
,
people
went
to
bed
*NL*
early
in
the
quarter
of
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
left
alone
with
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
d'Artagnan
turned
toward
her
;
*NL*
the
poor
woman
reclined
where
she
had
been
left
,
half-fainting
upon
an
*NL*
armchair
.
D'Artagnan
examined
her
with
a
rapid
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
charming
woman
of
twenty-five
or
twenty-six
years
,
with
dark
*NL*
hair
,
blue
eyes
,
and
a
nose
slightly
turned
up
,
admirable
teeth
,
and
a
*NL*
complexion
marbled
with
rose
and
opal
.
There
,
however
,
ended
the
signs
*NL*
which
might
have
confounded
her
with
a
lady
of
rank
.
The
hands
were
*NL*
white
,
but
without
delicacy
;
the
feet
did
not
bespeak
the
woman
of
*NL*
quality
.
Happily
,
d'Artagnan
was
not
yet
acquainted
with
such
niceties
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
d'Artagnan
was
examining
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
and
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
close
to
her
,
he
saw
on
the
ground
a
fine
cambric
handkerchief
,
which
he
*NL*
picked
up
,
as
was
his
habit
,
and
at
the
corner
of
which
he
recognized
*NL*
the
same
cipher
he
had
seen
on
the
handkerchief
which
had
nearly
caused
*NL*
him
and
Aramis
to
cut
each
other
's
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
,
d'Artagnan
had
been
cautious
with
respect
to
*NL*
handkerchiefs
with
arms
on
them
,
and
he
therefore
placed
in
the
pocket
*NL*
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
the
one
he
had
just
picked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Mme.
Bonacieux
recovered
her
senses
.
She
opened
her
eyes
,
*NL*
looked
around
her
with
terror
,
saw
that
the
apartment
was
empty
and
that
*NL*
she
was
alone
with
her
liberator
.
She
extended
her
hands
to
him
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
the
sweetest
smile
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
!
''
said
she
,
``
you
have
saved
me
;
permit
me
to
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
have
only
done
what
every
gentleman
would
*NL*
have
done
in
my
place
;
you
owe
me
no
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
monsieur
,
oh
,
yes
;
and
I
hope
to
prove
to
you
that
you
have
*NL*
not
served
an
ingrate
.
But
what
could
these
men
,
whom
I
at
first
took
*NL*
for
robbers
,
want
with
me
,
and
why
is
Monsieur
Bonacieux
not
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
those
men
were
more
dangerous
than
any
robbers
could
have
been
,
*NL*
for
they
are
the
agents
of
the
cardinal
;
and
as
to
your
husband
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
he
is
not
here
because
he
was
yesterday
evening
*NL*
conducted
to
the
Bastille
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
in
the
Bastille
!
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
What
*NL*
has
he
done
?
Poor
dear
man
,
he
is
innocence
itself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
something
like
a
faint
smile
lighted
the
still-terrified
features
of
*NL*
the
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
he
done
,
madame
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
believe
that
his
only
*NL*
crime
is
to
have
at
the
same
time
the
good
fortune
and
the
misfortune

*NL*
be
your

*NL*

Ah

his

I
do
not

And
did
my

know
I
had
been
carried
off

*NL*
*NL*

He
was
informed

by

written
to
him
by

himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
he
suspect

said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
with
some
embarrassment
,
*NL*
``
the
cause
of
this
event

*NL*
*NL*

He
attributed
it

to
a
political

*NL*
*NL*

I
doubted
from
the
first

I
think

Then
my

has
not
suspected
me
a
single

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
from

proud

your

your
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
smile
,
almost
imperceptible
,
stole
over
the
rosy
lips
of
the
*NL*
pretty
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

''
continued
d'Artagnan
,
``
how
did
you
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
advantage
of
a
moment
when
they
left
me
alone

as
I
had
*NL*
known
since
morning
the
reason
of
my
abduction
,
with
the
help
of
the
*NL*
sheets
I
let
myself
down
from
the
window
.
Then
,
as
I
believed
my
husband
*NL*
would
be
at
home
,
I
hastened
hither
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
place
yourself

*NL*
*NL*

Oh

no

poor

man

I
knew
very
well
that
he
was
incapable
of

defending
me

but
as
he
could
serve
us
in
other
ways

I
wished
to
inform
*NL*
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

that

not
my
secret

I
must
not

Besides

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
she
passed
her
arm
under
that
of
d'Artagnan

urged
*NL*
him
forward
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*

The
young
woman

the
young
man
,
without
taking
the
trouble
to
shut
*NL*
the
door
after
them
,
descended
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
rapidly
,
turned
*NL*
into
the
Rue
des
Fosses-Monsieur-le-Prince

did
not
stop

came
to
the
Place

And
now

d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*

quite
a

Mme.

Both
resumed
their
way
.
As
d'Artagnan
had
foreseen
,
Athos
was
not
*NL*
within
.
He
took
the
key
,
which
was
customarily
given
him
as
one
of
the
*NL*
family
,
ascended
the
stairs
,
and
introduced
Mme.
Bonacieux
into
the
*NL*
little
apartment
of
which
we
have
given
a
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
he

he
tapped
*NL*
thrice

two
taps
close
together

pretty
hard
,
the
other
after
an
*NL*
interval
,
and
lighter

*NL*

*NL*
D'Artagnan
bowed
to
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
darting
at
her
the
most
loving
*NL*
glance
that
he
could
possibly
concentrate
upon
her
charming
little
*NL*
person
;
and
while
he
descended
the
stairs
,
he
heard
the
door
closed
and
*NL*
double-locked
.
In
two
bounds
he
was
at
the
Louvre
;
as
he
entered
the
*NL*
wicket
of
L'Echelle
,
ten
o'clock
struck
.
All
the
events
we
have
*NL*
described
had
taken
place
within
a
half
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
fell
out
as
Mme.
Bonacieux
prophesied
.
On
hearing
the
*NL*
password
,
Germain
bowed
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
Laporte
was
at
the
lodge
;
in
*NL*
two
words
d'Artagnan
informed
him
where
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
.
Laporte
*NL*
assured
himself
,
by
having
it
twice
repeated
,
of
the
accurate
address
,
*NL*
and
set
off
at
a
run
.
Hardly
,
however
,
had
he
taken
ten
steps
before
he
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
''
said
he
to
d'Artagnan
,
``
a
suggestion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
get
into
trouble

has
taken

*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
call
upon
him
,
in
order
that
he
may
give
evidence
of
your
having
*NL*
been
with
him
at
half
past
nine
.
In
a
court
of
justice
that
is
called
an
*NL*
alibi
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
found
his
advice
prudent
.
He
took
to
his
heels
,
and
was
soon
*NL*
at
M.
de
Treville
's
;
but
instead
of
going
into
the
saloon
with
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
crowd
,
he
asked
to
be
introduced
to
M.
de
Treville
's
office
.
As
*NL*
d'Artagnan
so
constantly
frequented
the
hotel
,
no
difficulty
was
made
in
*NL*
complying
with
his
request
,
and
a
servant
went
to
inform
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
that
his
young
compatriot
,
having
something
important
to
communicate
,
*NL*
solicited
a
private
audience
.
Five
minutes
after
,
M.
de
Treville
was
*NL*
asking
d'Artagnan
what
he
could
do
to
serve
him
,
and
what
caused
his
*NL*
visit
at
so
late
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
profited
by
the
moment
*NL*
he
had
been
left
alone
to
put
back
M.
de
Treville
's
clock
three-quarters
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
``
but
I
thought
,
as
it
was
yet
only
twenty-five
minutes
past
*NL*
nine
,
it
was
not
too
late
to
wait
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
minutes
past
nine
!
''
cried
M.
de
Treville
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
clock
;
``
why
,
that
's
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
rather
,
monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
the
clock
shows
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
;
``
I
believed
it
later
.
But
what
can
I
*NL*
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
told
M.
de
Treville
a
long
history
about
the
queen
.
He
*NL*
expressed
to
him
the
fears
he
entertained
with
respect
to
her
Majesty
;
*NL*
he
related
to
him
what
he
had
heard
of
the
projects
of
the
cardinal
with
*NL*
regard
to
Buckingham
,
and
all
with
a
tranquillity
and
candor
of
which
M.
*NL*
de
Treville
was
the
more
the
dupe
,
from
having
himself
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
observed
something
fresh
between
the
cardinal
,
the
king
,
and
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
ten
o'clock
was
striking
,
d'Artagnan
left
M.
de
Treville
,
who
thanked
*NL*
him
for
his
information
,
recommended
him
to
have
the
service
of
the
king
*NL*
and
queen
always
at
heart
,
and
returned
to
the
saloon
;
but
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
stairs
,
d'Artagnan
remembered
he
had
forgotten
his
cane
.
He
*NL*
consequently
sprang
up
again
,
re-entered
the
office
,
with
a
turn
of
his
*NL*
finger
set
the
clock
right
again
,
that
it
might
not
be
perceived
the
*NL*
next
day
that
it
had
been
put
wrong
,
and
certain
from
that
time
that
he
*NL*
had
a
witness
to
prove
his
alibi
,
he
ran
downstairs
and
soon
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
street
.

IN
WHICH
THE
PLOT
THICKENS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
visit
to
M.
de
Treville
being
paid
,
the
pensive
d'Artagnan
took
the
*NL*
longest
way
homeward
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
what
was
d'Artagnan
thinking
,
that
he
strayed
thus
from
his
path
,
*NL*
gazing
at
the
stars
of
heaven
,
and
sometimes
sighing
,
sometimes
smiling
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
For
an
apprentice
Musketeer
the
young
*NL*
woman
was
almost
an
ideal
of
love
.
Pretty
,
mysterious
,
initiated
in
*NL*
almost
all
the
secrets
of
the
court
,
which
reflected
such
a
charming
*NL*
gravity
over
her
pleasing
features
,
it
might
be
surmised
that
she
was
*NL*
not
wholly
unmoved
;
and
this
is
an
irresistible
charm
to
novices
in
*NL*
love
.
Moreover
,
d'Artagnan
had
delivered
her
from
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
demons
who
wished
to
search
and
ill
treat
her
;
and
this
important
*NL*
service
had
established
between
them
one
of
those
sentiments
of
*NL*
gratitude
which
so
easily
assume
a
more
tender
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
already
fancied
himself
,
so
rapid
is
the
flight
of
our
dreams
*NL*
upon
the
wings
of
imagination
,
accosted
by
a
messenger
from
the
young
*NL*
woman
,
who
brought
him
some
billet
appointing
a
meeting
,
a
gold
chain
,
*NL*
or
a
diamond
.
We
have
observed
that
young
cavaliers
received
presents
*NL*
from
their
king
without
shame
.
Let
us
add
that
in
these
times
of
lax
*NL*
morality
they
had
no
more
delicacy
with
respect
to
the
mistresses
;
and
*NL*
that
the
latter
almost
always
left
them
valuable
and
durable
*NL*
remembrances
,
as
if
they
essayed
to
conquer
the
fragility
of
their
*NL*
sentiments
by
the
solidity
of
their
gifts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
a
blush
,
men
made
their
way
in
the
world
by
the
means
of
women
*NL*
blushing
.
Such
as
were
only
beautiful
gave
their
beauty
,
whence
,
without
*NL*
doubt
,
comes
the
proverb
,
``
The
most
beautiful
girl
in
the
world
can
only
*NL*
give
what
she
has
.
''
Such
as
were
rich
gave
in
addition
a
part
of
their
*NL*
money
;
and
a
vast
number
of
heroes
of
that
gallant
period
may
be
cited
*NL*
who
would
neither
have
won
their
spurs
in
the
first
place
,
nor
their
*NL*
battles
afterward
,
without
the
purse
,
more
or
less
furnished
,
which
*NL*
their
mistress
fastened
to
the
saddle
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
owned
nothing
.
Provincial
diffidence
,
that
slight
varnish
,
*NL*
the
ephemeral
flower
,
that
down
of
the
peach
,
had
evaporated
to
the
*NL*
winds
through
the
little
orthodox
counsels
which
the
three
Musketeers
*NL*
gave
their
friend
.
D'Artagnan
,
following
the
strange
custom
of
the
*NL*
times
,
considered
himself
at
Paris
as
on
a
campaign
,
neither
more
nor
*NL*
less
than
if
he
had
been
in
Flanders
--
Spain
yonder
,
woman
here
.
In
each
*NL*
there
was
an
enemy
to
contend
with
,
and
contributions
to
be
levied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
we
must
say
,
at
the
present
moment
d'Artagnan
was
ruled
by
a
*NL*
feeling
much
more
noble
and
disinterested
.
The
mercer
had
said
that
he
*NL*
was
rich
;
the
young
man
might
easily
guess
that
with
so
weak
a
man
as
M.
*NL*
Bonacieux
;
and
interest
was
almost
foreign
to
this
commencement
of
love
,
*NL*
which
had
been
the
consequence
of
it
.
We
say
ALMOST
,
for
the
idea
that
a
*NL*
young
,
handsome
,
kind
,
and
witty
woman
is
at
the
same
time
rich
takes
*NL*
nothing
from
the
beginning
of
love
,
but
on
the
contrary
strengthens
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
in
affluence
a
crowd
of
aristocratic
cares
and
caprices
which
*NL*
are
highly
becoming
to
beauty
.
A
fine
and
white
stocking
,
a
silken
robe
,
*NL*
a
lace
kerchief
,
a
pretty
slipper
on
the
foot
,
a
tasty
ribbon
on
the
*NL*
head
do
not
make
an
ugly
woman
pretty
,
but
they
make
a
pretty
woman
*NL*
beautiful
,
without
reckoning
the
hands
,
which
gain
by
all
this
;
the
*NL*
hands
,
among
women
particularly
,
to
be
beautiful
must
be
idle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
,
as
the
reader
,
from
whom
we
have
not
concealed
the
*NL*
state
of
his
fortune
,
very
well
knows
--
d'Artagnan
was
not
a
millionaire
;
*NL*
he
hoped
to
become
one
someday
,
but
the
time
which
in
his
own
mind
he
*NL*
fixed
upon
for
this
happy
change
was
still
far
distant
.
In
the
*NL*
meanwhile
,
how
disheartening
to
see
the
woman
one
loves
long
for
those
*NL*
thousands
of
nothings
which
constitute
a
woman
's
happiness
,
and
be
*NL*
unable
to
give
her
those
thousands
of
nothings
.
At
least
,
when
the
woman
*NL*
is
rich
and
the
lover
is
not
,
that
which
he
can
not
offer
she
offers
to
*NL*
herself
;
and
although
it
is
generally
with
her
husband
's
money
that
she
*NL*
procures
herself
this
indulgence
,
the
gratitude
for
it
seldom
reverts
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
,
disposed
to
become
the
most
tender
of
lovers
,
was
at
*NL*
the
same
time
a
very
devoted
friend
.
In
the
midst
of
his
amorous
*NL*
projects
for
the
mercer
's
wife
,
he
did
not
forget
his
friends
.
The
*NL*
pretty
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
just
the
woman
to
walk
with
in
the
Plain
St.
*NL*
Denis
or
in
the
fair
of
St.
Germain
,
in
company
with
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
*NL*
Aramis
,
to
whom
d'Artagnan
had
often
remarked
this
.
Then
one
could
enjoy
*NL*
charming
little
dinners
,
where
one
touches
on
one
side
the
hand
of
a
*NL*
friend
,
and
on
the
other
the
foot
of
a
mistress
.
Besides
,
on
pressing
*NL*
occasions
,
in
extreme
difficulties
,
d'Artagnan
would
become
the
*NL*
preserver
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
M.
Bonacieux
,
whom
d'Artagnan
had
pushed
into
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
officers
,
denying
him
aloud
although
he
had
promised
in
a
whisper
to
*NL*
save
him
?
We
are
compelled
to
admit
to
our
readers
that
d'Artagnan
*NL*
thought
nothing
about
him
in
any
way
;
or
that
if
he
did
think
of
him
,
it
*NL*
was
only
to
say
to
himself
that
he
was
very
well
where
he
was
,
wherever
*NL*
it
might
be
.
Love
is
the
most
selfish
of
all
the
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
our
readers
reassure
themselves
.
If
d'Artagnan
forgets
his
host
,
or
*NL*
appears
to
forget
him
,
under
the
pretense
of
not
knowing
where
he
has
*NL*
been
carried
,
we
will
not
forget
him
,
and
we
know
where
he
is
.
But
for
*NL*
the
moment
,
let
us
do
as
did
the
amorous
Gascon
;
we
will
see
after
the
*NL*
worthy
mercer
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
reflecting
on
his
future
amours
,
addressing
himself
to
the
*NL*
beautiful
night
,
and
smiling
at
the
stars
,
ascended
the
Rue
*NL*
Cherish-Midi
,
or
Chase-Midi
,
as
it
was
then
called
.
As
he
found
himself
*NL*
in
the
quarter
in
which
Aramis
lived
,
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
pay
*NL*
his
friend
a
visit
in
order
to
explain
the
motives
which
had
led
him
to
*NL*
send
Planchet
with
a
request
that
he
would
come
instantly
to
the
*NL*
mousetrap
.
Now
,
if
Aramis
had
been
at
home
when
Planchet
came
to
his
*NL*
abode
,
he
had
doubtless
hastened
to
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
,
and
finding
*NL*
nobody
there
but
his
other
two
companions
perhaps
,
they
would
not
be
*NL*
able
to
conceive
what
all
this
meant
.
This
mystery
required
an
*NL*
explanation
;
at
least
,
so
d'Artagnan
declared
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
likewise
thought
this
was
an
opportunity
for
talking
about
pretty
*NL*
little
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
of
whom
his
head
,
if
not
his
heart
,
was
already
*NL*
full
.
We
must
never
look
for
discretion
in
first
love
.
First
love
is
*NL*
accompanied
by
such
excessive
joy
that
unless
the
joy
be
allowed
to
*NL*
overflow
,
it
will
stifle
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
for
two
hours
past
had
been
dark
,
and
seemed
a
desert
.
Eleven
*NL*
o'clock
sounded
from
all
the
clocks
of
the
Faubourg
St.
Germain
.
It
was
*NL*
delightful
weather
.
D'Artagnan
was
passing
along
a
lane
on
the
spot
*NL*
where
the
Rue
d'Assas
is
now
situated
,
breathing
the
balmy
emanations
*NL*
which
were
borne
upon
the
wind
from
the
Rue
de
Vaugirard
,
and
which
*NL*
arose
from
the
gardens
refreshed
by
the
dews
of
evening
and
the
breeze
*NL*
of
night
.
From
a
distance
resounded
,
deadened
,
however
,
by
good
*NL*
shutters
,
the
songs
of
the
tipplers
,
enjoying
themselves
in
the
cabarets
*NL*
scattered
along
the
plain
.
Arrived
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
d'Artagnan
*NL*
turned
to
the
left
.
The
house
in
which
Aramis
dwelt
was
situated
between
*NL*
the
Rue
Cassette
and
the
Rue
Servandoni
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
just
passed
the
Rue
Cassette
,
and
already
perceived
the
*NL*
door
of
his
friend
's
house
,
shaded
by
a
mass
of
sycamores
and
clematis
*NL*
which
formed
a
vast
arch
opposite
the
front
of
it
,
when
he
perceived
*NL*
something
like
a
shadow
issuing
from
the
Rue
Servandoni
.
This
something
*NL*
was
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
and
d'Artagnan
at
first
believed
it
was
a
man
;
*NL*
but
by
the
smallness
of
the
form
,
the
hesitation
of
the
walk
,
and
the
*NL*
indecision
of
the
step
,
he
soon
discovered
that
it
was
a
woman
.
Further
,
*NL*
this
woman
,
as
if
not
certain
of
the
house
she
was
seeking
,
lifted
up
*NL*
her
eyes
to
look
around
her
,
stopped
,
went
backward
,
and
then
returned
*NL*
again
.
D'Artagnan
was
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
and
offer
her
my
services
?
''
thought
he
.
``
By
her
step
she
*NL*
must
be
young
;
perhaps
she
is
pretty
.
Oh
,
yes
!
But
a
woman
who
wanders
*NL*
in
the
streets
at
this
hour
only
ventures
out
to
meet
her
lover
.
If
I
*NL*
should
disturb
a
rendezvous
,
that
would
not
be
the
best
means
of
*NL*
commencing
an
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
the
young
woman
continued
to
advance
,
counting
the
houses
and
*NL*
windows
.
This
was
neither
long
nor
difficult
.
There
were
but
three
*NL*
hotels
in
this
part
of
the
street
;
and
only
two
windows
looking
toward
*NL*
the
road
,
one
of
which
was
in
a
pavilion
parallel
to
that
which
Aramis
*NL*
occupied
,
the
other
belonging
to
Aramis
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARIDIEU
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
,
to
whose
mind
the
niece
of
the
*NL*
theologian
reverted
,
``
PARDIEU
,
it
would
be
droll
if
this
belated
dove
*NL*
should
be
in
search
of
our
friend
's
house
.
But
on
my
soul
,
it
looks
so
.
*NL*
Ah
,
my
dear
Aramis
,
this
time
I
shall
find
you
out
.
''
And
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
making
himself
as
small
as
he
could
,
concealed
himself
in
the
darkest
*NL*
side
of
the
street
near
a
stone
bench
placed
at
the
back
of
a
niche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
continued
to
advance
;
and
in
addition
to
the
lightness
*NL*
of
her
step
,
which
had
betrayed
her
,
she
emitted
a
little
cough
which
*NL*
denoted
a
sweet
voice
.
D'Artagnan
believed
this
cough
to
be
a
signal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
whether
the
cough
had
been
answered
by
a
similar
signal
*NL*
which
had
fixed
the
irresolution
of
the
nocturnal
seeker
,
or
whether
*NL*
without
this
aid
she
saw
that
she
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
her
journey
,
*NL*
she
resolutely
drew
near
to
Aramis
's
shutter
,
and
tapped
,
at
three
equal
*NL*
intervals
,
with
her
bent
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
very
fine
,
dear
Aramis
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
``
Ah
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Hypocrite
,
I
understand
how
you
study
theology
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
blows
were
scarcely
struck
,
when
the
inside
blind
was
opened
*NL*
and
a
light
appeared
through
the
panes
of
the
outside
shutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
the
listener
,
``
not
through
doors
,
but
through
windows
!
*NL*
Ah
,
this
visit
was
expected
.
We
shall
see
the
windows
open
,
and
the
lady
*NL*
enter
by
escalade
.
Very
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
the
great
astonishment
of
d'Artagnan
,
the
shutter
remained
*NL*
closed
.
Still
more
,
the
light
which
had
shone
for
an
instant
*NL*
disappeared
,
and
all
was
again
in
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
thought
this
could
not
last
long
,
and
continued
to
look
with
*NL*
all
his
eyes
and
listen
with
all
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
right
;
at
the
end
of
some
seconds
two
sharp
taps
were
heard
*NL*
inside
.
The
young
woman
in
the
street
replied
by
a
single
tap
,
and
the
*NL*
shutter
was
opened
a
little
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
judged
whether
d'Artagnan
looked
or
listened
with
avidity
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
the
light
had
been
removed
into
another
chamber
;
but
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
young
man
were
accustomed
to
the
night
.
Besides
,
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
Gascons
have
,
as
it
is
asserted
,
like
those
of
cats
,
the
faculty
of
*NL*
seeing
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
saw
that
the
young
woman
took
from
her
pocket
a
white
*NL*
object
,
which
she
unfolded
quickly
,
and
which
took
the
form
of
a
*NL*
handkerchief
.
She
made
her
interlocutor
observe
the
corner
of
this
*NL*
unfolded
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
immediately
recalled
to
d'Artagnan
's
mind
the
handkerchief
which
he
*NL*
had
found
at
the
feet
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
which
had
reminded
him
of
that
*NL*
which
he
had
dragged
from
under
the
feet
of
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
could
that
handkerchief
signify
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Placed
where
he
was
,
d'Artagnan
could
not
perceive
the
face
of
Aramis
.
*NL*
We
say
Aramis
,
because
the
young
man
entertained
no
doubt
that
it
was
*NL*
his
friend
who
held
this
dialogue
from
the
interior
with
the
lady
of
the
*NL*
exterior
.
Curiosity
prevailed
over
prudence
;
and
profiting
by
the
*NL*
preoccupation
into
which
the
sight
of
the
handkerchief
appeared
to
have
*NL*
plunged
the
two
personages
now
on
the
scene
,
he
stole
from
his
hiding
*NL*
place
,
and
quick
as
lightning
,
but
stepping
with
utmost
caution
,
he
ran
*NL*
and
placed
himself
close
to
the
angle
of
the
wall
,
from
which
his
eye
*NL*
could
pierce
the
interior
of
Aramis
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
gaining
this
advantage
d'Artagnan
was
near
uttering
a
cry
of
*NL*
surprise
;
it
was
not
Aramis
who
was
conversing
with
the
nocturnal
*NL*
visitor
,
it
was
a
woman
!
D'Artagnan
,
however
,
could
only
see
enough
to
*NL*
recognize
the
form
of
her
vestments
,
not
enough
to
distinguish
her
*NL*
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
the
woman
inside
drew
a
second
handkerchief
from
her
*NL*
pocket
,
and
exchanged
it
for
that
which
had
just
been
shown
to
her
.
Then
*NL*
some
words
were
spoken
by
the
two
women
.
At
length
the
shutter
closed
.
*NL*
The
woman
who
was
outside
the
window
turned
round
,
and
passed
within
*NL*
four
steps
of
d'Artagnan
,
pulling
down
the
hood
of
her
mantle
;
but
the
*NL*
precaution
was
too
late
,
d'Artagnan
had
already
recognized
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
!
The
suspicion
that
it
was
she
had
crossed
the
mind
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
when
she
drew
the
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
;
but
what
*NL*
probability
was
there
that
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
who
had
sent
for
M.
Laporte
*NL*
in
order
to
be
reconducted
to
the
Louvre
,
should
be
running
about
the
*NL*
streets
of
Paris
at
half
past
eleven
at
night
,
at
the
risk
of
being
*NL*
abducted
a
second
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
must
be
,
then
,
an
affair
of
importance
;
and
what
is
the
most
*NL*
important
affair
to
a
woman
of
twenty-five
!
Love
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
was
it
on
her
own
account
,
or
on
account
of
another
,
that
she
*NL*
exposed
herself
to
such
hazards
?
This
was
a
question
the
young
man
asked
*NL*
himself
,
whom
the
demon
of
jealousy
already
gnawed
,
being
in
heart
*NL*
neither
more
nor
less
than
an
accepted
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
very
simple
means
of
satisfying
himself
whither
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
was
going
;
that
was
to
follow
her
.
This
method
was
so
simple
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
employed
it
quite
naturally
and
instinctively
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
sight
of
the
young
man
,
who
detached
himself
from
the
wall
*NL*
like
a
statue
walking
from
its
niche
,
and
at
the
noise
of
the
steps
*NL*
which
she
heard
resound
behind
her
,
Mme.
Bonacieux
uttered
a
little
cry
*NL*
and
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
ran
after
her
.
It
was
not
difficult
for
him
to
overtake
a
*NL*
woman
embarrassed
with
her
cloak
.
He
came
up
with
her
before
she
had
*NL*
traversed
a
third
of
the
street
.
The
unfortunate
woman
was
exhausted
,
*NL*
not
by
fatigue
,
but
by
terror
,
and
when
d'Artagnan
placed
his
hand
upon
*NL*
her
shoulder
,
she
sank
upon
one
knee
,
crying
in
a
choking
voice
,
``
Kill
*NL*
me
,
if
you
please
,
you
shall
know
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
raised
her
by
passing
his
arm
round
her
waist
;
but
as
he
felt
*NL*
by
her
weight
she
was
on
the
point
of
fainting
,
he
made
haste
to
*NL*
reassure
her
by
protestations
of
devotedness
.
These
protestations
were
*NL*
nothing
for
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
for
such
protestations
may
be
made
with
the
*NL*
worst
intentions
in
the
world
;
but
the
voice
was
all
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
*NL*
thought
she
recognized
the
sound
of
that
voice
;
she
reopened
her
eyes
,
*NL*
cast
a
quick
glance
upon
the
man
who
had
terrified
her
so
,
and
at
once
*NL*
perceiving
it
was
d'Artagnan
,
she
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
,
``
Oh
,
it
is
you
,
*NL*
it
is
you
!
Thank
God
,
thank
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
I
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
is
I
,
whom
God
has
sent
to
watch
*NL*
over
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
with
that
intention
you
followed
me
?
''
asked
the
young
woman
,
*NL*
with
a
coquettish
smile
,
whose
somewhat
bantering
character
resumed
its
*NL*
influence
,
and
with
whom
all
fear
had
disappeared
from
the
moment
in
*NL*
which
she
recognized
a
friend
in
one
she
had
taken
for
an
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
no
,
I
confess
it
.
It
was
chance
that
threw
me
in
*NL*
your
way
;
I
saw
a
woman
knocking
at
the
window
of
one
of
my
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
your
friends

''
interrupted
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without

friends

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

That

*NL*
D'Artagnan
offered
his
arm
to
Mme.

,
who
willingly
took
it
,
*NL*
half
laughing
,
half
trembling
,
and
both
gained
the
top
of
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Harpe
.
Arriving
there
,
the
young
woman
seemed
to
hesitate
,
as
she
had
*NL*
before
done
in
the
Rue
Vaugirard
.
She
seemed
,
however
,
by
certain
signs
,
*NL*
to
recognize
a
door
,
and
approaching
that
door
,
``
And
now

*NL*
said
she
,
``

d'Artagnan

in

*NL*
on
my
own
account
can
not
stop
you
,
think
of
those
you
may
yourself
run
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
there
is
peril
of
imprisonment
,
risk
of
life
in
knowing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
not
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
!
''
said
the
young
woman
,
supplicating
him
and
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
together
,
``
monsieur
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
,
by
the
honor
of
a
*NL*
soldier
,
by
the
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
,
depart
!
There
,
there
midnight
*NL*
sounds
!
That
is
the
hour
when
I
am
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
bowing
;
``
I
can
refuse
nothing
asked
of
me
*NL*
thus
.
Be
content
;
I
will
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
not
follow
me
;
you
will
not
watch
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
return
home
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
was
quite
sure
you
were
a
good
and
brave
young
man
,
''
said
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
,
and
placing
the
other
upon
the
*NL*
knocker
of
a
little
door
almost
hidden
in
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
seized
the
hand
held
out
to
him
,
and
kissed
it
ardently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
you
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
with
that
ingenuous
*NL*
roughness
which
women
often
prefer
to
the
affectations
of
politeness
,
*NL*
because
it
betrays
the
depths
of
the
thought
and
proves
that
feeling
*NL*
prevails
over
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
resumed
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
in
a
voice
almost
caressing
,
and
*NL*
pressing
the
hand
of
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
not
relinquished
hers
,
``
well
:
I
*NL*
will
not
say
as
much
as
you
do
;
what
is
lost
for
today
may
not
be
lost
*NL*
forever
.
Who
knows
,
when
I
shall
be
at
liberty
,
that
I
may
not
satisfy
*NL*
your
curiosity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
make
the
same
promise
to
my
love
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
beside
himself
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
to
that
,
I
do
not
engage
myself
.
That
depends
upon
the
*NL*
sentiments
with
which
you
may
inspire
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
today
,
madame
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
today
,
I
am
no
further
than
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
You
are
too
charming
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
sorrowfully
;
``
and
you
abuse
*NL*
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
use
your
generosity
,
that
's
all
.
But
be
of
good
cheer
;
with
*NL*
certain
people
,
everything
comes
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
render
me
the
happiest
of
men
!
Do
not
forget
this
evening
--
do
*NL*
not
forget
that
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
.
In
the
proper
time
and
place
I
will
remember
everything
.
*NL*
Now
then
,
go
,
go
,
in
the
name
of
heaven
!
I
was
expected
at
sharp
*NL*
midnight
,
and
I
am
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
in
certain
circumstances
five
minutes
are
five
ages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
loves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
And
who
told
you
I
had
no
affair
with
a
lover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
man
,
then
,
who
expects
you
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
A
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
discussion
is
going
to
begin
again
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
with
a
*NL*
half-smile
which
was
not
exempt
from
a
tinge
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
go
,
I
depart
!
I
believe
in
you
,
and
I
would
have
all
the
*NL*
merit
of
my
devotion
,
even
if
that
devotion
were
stupidity
.
Adieu
,
*NL*
madame
,
adieu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
if
he
only
felt
strength
to
detach
himself
by
a
violent
effort
*NL*
from
the
hand
he
held
,
he
sprang
away
,
running
,
while
Mme.
Bonacieux
*NL*
knocked
,
as
at
the
shutter
,
three
light
and
regular
taps
.
When
he
had
*NL*
gained
the
angle
of
the
street
,
he
turned
.
The
door
had
been
opened
,
and
*NL*
shut
again
;
the
mercer
's
pretty
wife
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
pursued
his
way
.
He
had
given
his
word
not
to
watch
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
and
if
his
life
had
depended
upon
the
spot
to
which
she
was
*NL*
going
or
upon
the
person
who
should
accompany
her
,
d'Artagnan
would
have
*NL*
returned
home
,
since
he
had
so
promised
.
Five
minutes
later
he
was
in
*NL*
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Athos
!
''
said
he
;
``
he
will
never
guess
what
all
this
means
.
He
will
*NL*
have
fallen
asleep
waiting
for
me
,
or
else
he
will
have
returned
home
,
*NL*
where
he
will
have
learned
that
a
woman
had
been
there
.
A
woman
with
*NL*
Athos
!
After
all
,
''
continued
d'Artagnan
,
``
there
was
certainly
one
with
*NL*
Aramis
.
All
this
is
very
strange
;
and
I
am
curious
to
know
how
it
will
*NL*
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Badly
,
monsieur
,
badly
!
''
replied
a
voice
which
the
young
man
recognized
*NL*
as
that
of
Planchet
;
for
,
soliloquizing
aloud
,
as
very
preoccupied
*NL*
people
do
,
he
had
entered
the
alley
,
at
the
end
of
which
were
the
stairs
*NL*
which
led
to
his
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
badly
?
What
do
you
mean
by
that
,
you
idiot
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
sorts
of
misfortunes

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
Monsieur
Athos
is
arrested

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arrested
!
Athos
arrested
!
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
found
in
your
lodging
;
they
took
him
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
whom
was
he
arrested

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Guards
brought
by
the
men
in
black
whom
you
put
to
flight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
he
not
tell
them
his
name
?
Why
did
he
not
tell
them
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
about
this
affair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
took
care
not
to
do
so
,
monsieur
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
came
up
to
me
*NL*
and
said
,
`
It
is
your
master
that
needs
his
liberty
at
this
moment
and
*NL*
not
I
,
since
he
knows
everything
and
I
know
nothing
.
They
will
believe
*NL*
he
is
arrested
,
and
that
will
give
him
time
;
in
three
days
I
will
tell
*NL*
them
who
I
am
,
and
they
can
not
fail
to
let
me
go
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
Athos
!
Noble
heart
!
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
know
him
well
*NL*
there
!
And
what
did
the
officers
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
conveyed
him
away
,
I
do
n't
know
where
--
to
the
Bastille
or
Fort
*NL*
l'Eveque
.
Two
remained
with
the
men
in
black
,
who
rummaged
every
place
*NL*
and
took
all
the
papers
.
The
last
two
mounted
guard
at
the
door
during
*NL*
this
examination
;
then
,
when
all
was
over
,
they
went
away
,
leaving
the
*NL*
house
empty
and
exposed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Porthos
and
Aramis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
not
find
them
;
they
did
not
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
may
come
any
moment
,
for
you
left
word
that
I
awaited
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

do
n't
budge

then

they
come

tell

what
has
happened

Let
*NL*
them
wait
for
me
at
the
Pomme-de-Pin
.
Here
it
would
be
dangerous
;
the
*NL*
house
may
be
watched
.
I
will
run
to
Monsieur
de
Treville
to
tell
them
*NL*
all
this
,
and
will
meet
them
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
remain
;
you
are
not
afraid
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
coming
back
*NL*
to
recommend
courage
to
his
lackey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
;
``
you
do
not
know
me
yet
.
I
am
brave
*NL*
when
I
set
about
it
.
It
is
all
in
beginning
.
Besides
,
I
am
a
Picard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
is
understood
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
you
would
rather
be
killed
*NL*
than
desert
your
post
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
;
and
there
is
nothing
I
would
not
do
to
prove
to
Monsieur
*NL*
that
I
am
attached
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
.
``
It
appears
that
the
method
I
have
*NL*
adopted
with
this
boy
is
decidedly
the
best
.
I
shall
use
it
again
upon
*NL*
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
all
the
swiftness
of
his
legs
,
already
a
little
fatigued
,
*NL*
however
,
with
the
perambulations
of
the
day
,
d'Artagnan
directed
his
*NL*
course
toward
M.
de
Treville
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
was
not
at
his
hotel
.
His
company
was
on
guard
at
the
*NL*
Louvre
;
he
was
at
the
Louvre
with
his
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
reach
M.
de
Treville
;
it
was
important
that
he
*NL*
should
be
informed
of
what
was
passing
.
D'Artagnan
resolved
to
try
and
*NL*
enter
the
Louvre
.
His
costume
of
Guardsman
in
the
company
of
M.
*NL*
Dessessart
ought
to
be
his
passport
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
therefore
went
down
the
Rue
des
Petits
Augustins
,
and
came
up
to
the
*NL*
quay
,
in
order
to
take
the
New
Bridge
.
He
had
at
first
an
idea
of
*NL*
crossing
by
the
ferry
;
but
on
gaining
the
riverside
,
he
had
mechanically
*NL*
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
perceived
that
he
had
not
wherewithal
*NL*
to
pay
his
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
gained
the
top
of
the
Rue
Guenegaud
,
he
saw
two
persons
coming
out
*NL*
of
the
Rue
Dauphine
whose
appearance
very
much
struck
him
.
Of
the
two
*NL*
persons
who
composed
this
group
,
one
was
a
man
and
the
other
a
woman
.
*NL*
The
woman
had
the
outline
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
the
man
resembled
Aramis
so
*NL*
much
as
to
be
mistaken
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
the
woman
wore
that
black
mantle
which
d'Artagnan
could
still
*NL*
see
outlined
on
the
shutter
of
the
Rue
de
Vaugirard
and
on
the
door
of
*NL*
the
Rue
de
la
Harpe
;
still
further
,
the
man
wore
the
uniform
of
a
*NL*
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
hood
was
pulled
down
,
and
the
man
held
a
handkerchief
to
his
*NL*
face
.
Both
,
as
this
double
precaution
indicated
,
had
an
interest
in
not
*NL*
being
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
the
bridge
.
That
was
d'Artagnan
's
road
,
as
he
was
going
to
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
D'Artagnan
followed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
gone
twenty
steps
before
he
became
convinced
that
the
woman
*NL*
was
really
Mme.
Bonacieux
and
that
the
man
was
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
at
that
instant
all
the
suspicions
of
jealousy
agitating
his
*NL*
heart
.
He
felt
himself
doubly
betrayed
,
by
his
friend
and
by
her
whom
he
*NL*
already
loved
like
a
mistress
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
declared
to
him
,
by
*NL*
all
the
gods
,
that
she
did
not
know
Aramis
;
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
after
having
made
this
assertion
,
he
found
her
hanging
on
the
arm
of
*NL*
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
not
reflect
that
he
had
only
known
the
mercer
's
pretty
*NL*
wife
for
three
hours
;
that
she
owed
him
nothing
but
a
little
gratitude
*NL*
for
having
delivered
her
from
the
men
in
black
,
who
wished
to
carry
her
*NL*
off
,
and
that
she
had
promised
him
nothing
.
He
considered
himself
an
*NL*
outraged
,
betrayed
,
and
ridiculed
lover
.
Blood
and
anger
mounted
to
his
*NL*
face
;
he
was
resolved
to
unravel
the
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
and
young
woman
perceived
they
were
watched
,
and
redoubled
*NL*
their
speed
.
D'Artagnan
determined
upon
his
course
.
He
passed
them
,
then
*NL*
returned
so
as
to
meet
them
exactly
before
the
Samaritaine
,
which
was
*NL*
illuminated
by
a
lamp
which
threw
its
light
over
all
that
part
of
the
*NL*
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
stopped
before
them
,
and
they
stopped
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
monsieur
?
''
demanded
the
Musketeer
,
recoiling
a
step
,
*NL*
and
with
a
foreign
accent
,
which
proved
to
d'Artagnan
that
he
was
*NL*
deceived
in
one
of
his
conjectures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
Aramis
!
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
it
is
not
Aramis
;
and
by
your
exclamation
I
perceive
you
*NL*
have
mistaken
me
for
another
,
and
pardon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pardon
me
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
stranger
.
``
Allow
me
,
then
,
to
pass
on
,
since
it
is
*NL*
not
with
me
you
have
anything
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
monsieur
,
it
is
not
with
you
that
I
have
anything
to
do
;
*NL*
it
is
with
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Madame
!
You
do
not
know
her
,
''
replied
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
deceived
,
monsieur
;
I
know
her
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
in
a
tone
of
reproach
,
``
ah
,
monsieur
,
I
had
*NL*
your
promise
as
a
soldier
and
your
word
as
a
gentleman
.
I
hoped
to
be
*NL*
able
to
rely
upon
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
madame
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
embarrassed
;
``
you
promised
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
my
arm
,
madame
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
and
let
us
continue
our
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
however
,
stupefied
,
cast
down
,
annihilated
by
all
that
*NL*
happened
,
stood
,
with
crossed
arms
,
before
the
Musketeer
and
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musketeer
advanced
two
steps
,
and
pushed
d'Artagnan
aside
with
his
*NL*
hand
.
D'Artagnan
made
a
spring
backward
and
drew
his
sword
.
At
the
same
*NL*
time
,
and
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
,
the
stranger
drew
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
my
Lord
!
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
throwing
herself
*NL*
between
the
combatants
and
seizing
the
swords
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
enlightened
by
a
sudden
idea
,
``
my
Lord
!
*NL*
Pardon
me
,
monsieur
,
but
you
are
not
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
in
an
undertone
;
*NL*
``
and
now
you
may
ruin
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
Madame
,
I
ask
a
hundred
pardons
!
But
I
love
her
,
my
Lord

and
*NL*
was
jealous
.
You
know
what
it
is
to
love
,
my
Lord

Pardon
me
,
and
then
*NL*
tell
me
how
I
can
risk
my
life
to
serve
your
Grace

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
brave
young
man
,
''
said
Buckingham
,
holding
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
pressed
it
respectfully
.
``
You
offer
me
your
services
;
*NL*
with
the
same
frankness
I
accept
them
.
Follow
us
at
a
distance
of
twenty
*NL*
paces
,
as
far
as
the
Louvre
,
and
if
anyone
watches
us
,
slay
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
placed
his
naked
sword
under
his
arm
,
allowed
the
duke
and
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
to
take
twenty
steps
ahead
,
and
then
followed
them
,
ready
*NL*
to
execute
the
instructions
of
the
noble
and
elegant
minister
of
Charles
*NL*
I.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
he
had
no
opportunity
to
give
the
duke
this
proof
of
his
*NL*
devotion
,
and
the
young
woman
and
the
handsome
Musketeer
entered
the
*NL*
Louvre
by
the
wicket
of
the
Echelle
without
any
interference
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
d'Artagnan
,
he
immediately
repaired
to
the
cabaret
of
the
*NL*
Pomme-de-Pin
,
where
he
found
Porthos
and
Aramis
awaiting
him
.
Without
*NL*
giving
them
any
explanation
of
the
alarm
and
inconvenience
he
had
caused
*NL*
them
,
he
told
them
that
he
had
terminated
the
affair
alone
in
which
he
*NL*
had
for
a
moment
believed
he
should
need
their
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
carried
away
as
we
are
by
our
narrative
,
we
must
leave
our
*NL*
three
friends
to
themselves
,
and
follow
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
and
his
*NL*
guide
through
the
labyrinths
of
the
Louvre
.

GEORGE
VILLIERS
,
DUKE
OF
BUCKINGHAM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
and
the
duke
entered
the
Louvre
without
difficulty
.
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
was
known
to
belong
to
the
queen
;
the
duke
wore
the
uniform
of
*NL*
the
Musketeers
of
M.
de
Treville
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
were
that
*NL*
evening
on
guard
.
Besides
,
Germain
was
in
the
interests
of
the
queen
;
*NL*
and
if
anything
should
happen
,
Mme.
Bonacieux
would
be
accused
of
having
*NL*
introduced
her
lover
into
the
Louvre
,
that
was
all
.
She
took
the
risk
*NL*
upon
herself
.
Her
reputation
would
be
lost
,
it
is
true
;
but
of
what
*NL*
value
in
the
world
was
the
reputation
of
the
little
wife
of
a
mercer
?
*NL*
*NL*
Once
within
the
interior
of
the
court
,
the
duke
and
the
young
woman
*NL*
followed
the
wall
for
the
space
of
about
twenty-five
steps
.
This
space
*NL*
passed
,
Mme.
Bonacieux
pushed
a
little
servants
'
door
,
open
by
day
but
*NL*
generally
closed
at
night
.
The
door
yielded
.
Both
entered
,
and
found
*NL*
themselves
in
darkness
;
but
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
acquainted
with
all
the
*NL*
turnings
and
windings
of
this
part
of
the
Louvre
,
appropriated
for
the
*NL*
people
of
the
household
.
She
closed
the
door
after
her
,
took
the
duke
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
and
after
a
few
experimental
steps
,
grasped
a
balustrade
,
put
*NL*
her
foot
upon
the
bottom
step
,
and
began
to
ascend
the
staircase
.
The
*NL*
duke
counted
two
stories
.
She
then
turned
to
the
right
,
followed
the
*NL*
course
of
a
long
corridor
,
descended
a
flight
,
went
a
few
steps
farther
,
*NL*
introduced
a
key
into
a
lock
,
opened
a
door
,
and
pushed
the
duke
into
an
*NL*
apartment
lighted
only
by
a
lamp
,
saying
,
``
Remain
here
,
my
Lord
Duke
;
*NL*
someone
will
come
.
''
She
then
went
out
by
the
same
door
,
which
she
*NL*
locked
,
so
that
the
duke
found
himself
literally
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
isolated
as
he
was
,
we
must
say
that
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Buckingham
did
not
experience
an
instant
of
fear
.
One
of
the
salient
*NL*
points
of
his
character
was
the
search
for
adventures
and
a
love
of
*NL*
romance
.
Brave
,
rash
,
and
enterprising
,
this
was
not
the
first
time
he
*NL*
had
risked
his
life
in
such
attempts
.
He
had
learned
that
the
pretended
*NL*
message
from
Anne
of
Austria
,
upon
the
faith
of
which
he
had
come
to
*NL*
Paris
,
was
a
snare
;
but
instead
of
regaining
England
,
he
had
,
abusing
*NL*
the
position
in
which
he
had
been
placed
,
declared
to
the
queen
that
he
*NL*
would
not
depart
without
seeing
her
.
The
queen
had
at
first
positively
*NL*
refused
;
but
at
length
became
afraid
that
the
duke
,
if
exasperated
,
*NL*
would
commit
some
folly
.
She
had
already
decided
upon
seeing
him
and
*NL*
urging
his
immediate
departure
,
when
,
on
the
very
evening
of
coming
to
*NL*
this
decision
,
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
who
was
charged
with
going
to
fetch
the
*NL*
duke
and
conducting
him
to
the
Louvre
,
was
abducted
.
For
two
days
no
one
*NL*
knew
what
had
become
of
her
,
and
everything
remained
in
suspense
;
but
*NL*
once
free
,
and
placed
in
communication
with
Laporte
,
matters
resumed
*NL*
their
course
,
and
she
accomplished
the
perilous
enterprise
which
,
but
*NL*
for
her
arrest
,
would
have
been
executed
three
days
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
,
left
alone
,
walked
toward
a
mirror
.
His
Musketeer
's
uniform
*NL*
became
him
marvelously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
thirty-five
,
which
was
then
his
age
,
he
passed
,
with
just
title
,
for
*NL*
the
handsomest
gentleman
and
the
most
elegant
cavalier
of
France
or
*NL*
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
favorite
of
two
kings
,
immensely
rich
,
all-powerful
in
a
kingdom
*NL*
which
he
disordered
at
his
fancy
and
calmed
again
at
his
caprice
,
George
*NL*
Villiers
,
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
had
lived
one
of
those
fabulous
existences
*NL*
which
survive
,
in
the
course
of
centuries
,
to
astonish
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
of
himself
,
convinced
of
his
own
power
,
certain
that
the
laws
which
*NL*
rule
other
men
could
not
reach
him
,
he
went
straight
to
the
object
he
*NL*
aimed
at
,
even
were
this
object
were
so
elevated
and
so
dazzling
that
it
*NL*
would
have
been
madness
for
any
other
even
to
have
contemplated
it
.
It
*NL*
was
thus
he
had
succeeded
in
approaching
several
times
the
beautiful
and
*NL*
proud
Anne
of
Austria
,
and
in
making
himself
loved
by
dazzling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Villiers
placed
himself
before
the
glass
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
restored
the
undulations
to
his
beautiful
hair
,
which
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
hat
had
disordered
,
twisted
his
mustache
,
and
,
his
heart
swelling
with
*NL*
joy
,
happy
and
proud
at
being
near
the
moment
he
had
so
long
sighed
for
,
*NL*
he
smiled
upon
himself
with
pride
and
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
door
concealed
in
the
tapestry
opened
,
and
a
woman
*NL*
appeared
.
Buckingham
saw
this
apparition
in
the
glass
;
he
uttered
a
cry
.
*NL*
It
was
the
queen
!
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
was
then
twenty-six
or
twenty-seven
years
of
age
;
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
she
was
in
the
full
splendor
of
her
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
carriage
was
that
of
a
queen
or
a
goddess
;
her
eyes
,
which
cast
the
*NL*
brilliancy
of
emeralds
,
were
perfectly
beautiful
,
and
yet
were
at
the
*NL*
same
time
full
of
sweetness
and
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mouth
was
small
and
rosy
;
and
although
her
underlip
,
like
that
of
*NL*
all
princes
of
the
House
of
Austria
,
protruded
slightly
beyond
the
*NL*
other
,
it
was
eminently
lovely
in
its
smile
,
but
as
profoundly
*NL*
disdainful
in
its
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
skin
was
admired
for
its
velvety
softness
;
her
hands
and
arms
were
*NL*
of
surpassing
beauty
,
all
the
poets
of
the
time
singing
them
as
*NL*
incomparable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
her
hair
,
which
,
from
being
light
in
her
youth
,
had
become
*NL*
chestnut
,
and
which
she
wore
curled
very
plainly
,
and
with
much
powder
,
*NL*
admirably
set
off
her
face
,
in
which
the
most
rigid
critic
could
only
*NL*
have
desired
a
little
less
rouge
,
and
the
most
fastidious
sculptor
a
*NL*
little
more
fineness
in
the
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
remained
for
a
moment
dazzled
.
Never
had
Anne
of
Austria
*NL*
appeared
to
him
so
beautiful
,
amid
balls
,
fetes
,
or
carousals
,
as
she
*NL*
appeared
to
him
at
this
moment
,
dressed
in
a
simple
robe
of
white
satin
,
*NL*
and
accompanied
by
Donna
Estafania
--
the
only
one
of
her
Spanish
women
*NL*
who
had
not
been
driven
from
her
by
the
jealousy
of
the
king
or
by
the
*NL*
persecutions
of
Richelieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
took
two
steps
forward
.
Buckingham
threw
himself
at
her
*NL*
feet
,
and
before
the
queen
could
prevent
him
,
kissed
the
hem
of
her
*NL*
robe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duke
,
you
already
know
that
it
is
not
I
who
caused
you
to
be
written
*NL*
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
madame
!
Yes
,
your
Majesty
!
''
cried
the
duke
.
``
I
know
that
I
*NL*
must
have
been
mad
,
senseless
,
to
believe
that
snow
would
become
*NL*
animated
or
marble
warm
;
but
what
then
!
They
who
love
believe
easily
in
*NL*
love
.
Besides
,
I
have
lost
nothing
by
this
journey
because
I
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Anne
,
``
but
you
know
why
and
how
I
see
you
;
because
,
*NL*
insensible
to
all
my
sufferings
,
you
persist
in
remaining
in
a
city
*NL*
where
,
by
remaining
,
you
run
the
risk
of
your
life
,
and
make
me
run
the
*NL*
risk
of
my
honor
.
I
see
you
to
tell
you
that
everything
separates
*NL*
us
--
the
depths
of
the
sea
,
the
enmity
of
kingdoms
,
the
sanctity
of
vows
.
*NL*
It
is
sacrilege
to
struggle
against
so
many
things
,
my
Lord
.
In
short
,
I
*NL*
see
you
to
tell
you
that
we
must
never
see
each
other
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
on
,
madame
,
speak
on
,
Queen
,
''
said
Buckingham
;
``
the
sweetness
of
*NL*
your
voice
covers
the
harshness
of
your
words
.
You
talk
of
sacrilege
!
*NL*
Why
,
the
sacrilege
is
the
separation
of
two
hearts
formed
by
God
for
*NL*
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
''
cried
the
queen
,
``
you
forget
that
I
have
never
said
that
I
*NL*
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
never
told
me
that
you
did
not
love
me
;
and
truly
,
to
*NL*
speak
such
words
to
me
would
be
,
on
the
part
of
your
Majesty
,
too
great
*NL*
an
ingratitude
.
For
tell
me
,
where
can
you
find
a
love
like
mine
--
a
love
*NL*
which
neither
time
,
nor
absence
,
nor
despair
can
extinguish
,
a
love
*NL*
which
contents
itself
with
a
lost
ribbon
,
a
stray
look
,
or
a
chance
*NL*
word
?
It
is
now
three
years
,
madame
,
since
I
saw
you
for
the
first
time
,
*NL*
and
during
those
three
years
I
have
loved
you
thus
.
Shall
I
tell
you
*NL*
each
ornament
of
your
toilet
?
Mark
!
I
see
you
now
.
You
were
seated
upon
*NL*
cushions
in
the
Spanish
fashion
;
you
wore
a
robe
of
green
satin
*NL*
embroidered
with
gold
and
silver
,
hanging
sleeves
knotted
upon
your
*NL*
beautiful
arms
--
those
lovely
arms
--
with
large
diamonds
.
You
wore
a
close
*NL*
ruff
,
a
small
cap
upon
your
head
of
the
same
color
as
your
robe
,
and
in
*NL*
that
cap
a
heron
's
feather
.
Hold
!
Hold
!
I
shut
my
eyes
,
and
I
can
see
*NL*
you
as
you
then
were
;
I
open
them
again
,
and
I
see
what
you
are
now
--
a
*NL*
hundred
times
more
beautiful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
folly
,
''
murmured
Anne
of
Austria
,
who
had
not
the
courage
to
find
*NL*
fault
with
the
duke
for
having
so
well
preserved
her
portrait
in
his
*NL*
heart
,
``
what
folly
to
feed
a
useless
passion
with
such
remembrances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
upon
what
then
must
I
live
?
I
have
nothing
but
memory
.
It
is
my
*NL*
happiness
,
my
treasure
,
my
hope
.
Every
time
I
see
you
is
a
fresh
diamond
*NL*
which
I
enclose
in
the
casket
of
my
heart
.
This
is
the
fourth
which
you
*NL*
have
let
fall
and
I
have
picked
up
;
for
in
three
years
,
madame
,
I
have
*NL*
only
seen
you
four
times
--
the
first
,
which
I
have
described
to
you
;
the
*NL*
second
,
at
the
mansion
of
Madame
de
Chevreuse
;
the
third
,
in
the
gardens
*NL*
of
Amiens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duke
,
''
said
the
queen
,
blushing
,
``
never
speak
of
that
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
us
speak
of
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
let
us
speak
of
it
!
That
is
*NL*
the
most
happy
and
brilliant
evening
of
my
life
!
You
remember
what
a
*NL*
beautiful
night
it
was
?
How
soft
and
perfumed
was
the
air
;
how
lovely
*NL*
the
blue
heavens
and
star-enameled
sky
!
Ah
,
then
,
madame
,
I
was
able
for
*NL*
one
instant
to
be
alone
with
you
.
Then
you
were
about
to
tell
me
*NL*
all
--
the
isolation
of
your
life
,
the
griefs
of
your
heart
.
You
leaned
*NL*
upon
my
arm
--
upon
this
,
madame
!
I
felt
,
in
bending
my
head
toward
you
,
*NL*
your
beautiful
hair
touch
my
cheek
;
and
every
time
that
it
touched
me
I
*NL*
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
Oh
,
Queen
!
Queen
!
You
do
not
know
what
*NL*
felicity
from
heaven
,
what
joys
from
paradise
,
are
comprised
in
a
moment
*NL*
like
that
.
Take
my
wealth
,
my
fortune
,
my
glory
,
all
the
days
I
have
to
*NL*
live
,
for
such
an
instant
,
for
a
night
like
that
.
For
that
night
,
*NL*
madame
,
that
night
you
loved
me
,
I
will
swear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
yes
;
it
is
possible
that
the
influence
of
the
place
,
the
charm
*NL*
of
the
beautiful
evening
,
the
fascination
of
your
look
--
the
thousand
*NL*
circumstances
,
in
short
,
which
sometimes
unite
to
destroy
a
woman
--
were
*NL*
grouped
around
me
on
that
fatal
evening
;
but
,
my
Lord
,
you
saw
the
queen
*NL*
come
to
the
aid
of
the
woman
who
faltered
.
At
the
first
word
you
dared
*NL*
to
utter
,
at
the
first
freedom
to
which
I
had
to
reply
,
I
called
for
*NL*
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
is
true
.
And
any
other
love
but
mine
would
have
sunk
*NL*
beneath
this
ordeal
;
but
my
love
came
out
from
it
more
ardent
and
more
*NL*
eternal
.
You
believed
that
you
would
fly
from
me
by
returning
to
Paris
;
*NL*
you
believed
that
I
would
not
dare
to
quit
the
treasure
over
which
my
*NL*
master
had
charged
me
to
watch
.
What
to
me
were
all
the
treasures
in
the
*NL*
world
,
or
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
!
Eight
days
after
,
I
was
back
*NL*
again
,
madame

That
time
you
had
nothing
to
say
to
me
;
I
had
risked
my
*NL*
life
and
favor
to
see
you
but
for
a
second
.
I
did
not
even
touch
your
*NL*
hand

you
pardoned
me
on
seeing
me
so
submissive
and
so
repentant
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

calumny
seized
upon
all
those
follies
in
which
I
took
no
part
,
*NL*
as
you
well
know
,
my
Lord
.
The
king
,
excited
by
the
cardinal
,
made
a
*NL*
terrible
clamor
.
Madame
de
Vernet
was
driven
from
me
,
Putange
was
*NL*
exiled
,
Madame
de
Chevreuse
fell
into
disgrace
,
and
when
you
wished
to
*NL*
come
back
as
ambassador
to
France
,
the
king
himself
--
remember
,
my
*NL*
lord
--
the
king
himself
opposed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

France
is
about
to
pay
for

refusal

I
am
*NL*
not
allowed
to
see
you
,
madame

you
shall
every
day
hear
of
me

What
*NL*
object

think
you
,
have
this
expedition
to
Re
and
this
league
with
the
*NL*
Protestants
of
La
Rochelle
which
I
am
projecting
?
The
pleasure

seeing
*NL*
you

I
have
no
hope

penetrating

in

to
Paris

I

well

But
this

may
bring
round

my
happiness
with
their
lives

what
is
that
to
me
,
provided
I
see
*NL*
you
again
!
All
this
is
perhaps
folly

perhaps
insanity
;

tell
me
what

has
a
lover
more
truly
in
love

what

a

more
ardent

stretched

closing

leaning

with

faithful
to
the

he
rushed
out

In
the
corridor
he
met

who
waited

who

with

the

precautions

conducted

MONSIEUR
BONACIEUX

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
all
this
,
as
may
have
been
observed
,
one
personage
*NL*
concerned
,
of
whom
,
notwithstanding
his
precarious
position
,
we
have
*NL*
appeared
to
take
but
very
little
notice
.
This
personage
was
M.
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
the
respectable
martyr
of
the
political
and
amorous
intrigues
*NL*
which
entangled
themselves
so
nicely
together
at
this
gallant
and
*NL*
chivalric
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
the
reader
may
remember
,
or
may
not
remember
--
fortunately
*NL*
we
have
promised
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officers
who
arrested
him
conducted
him
straight
to
the
Bastille
,
*NL*
where
he
passed
trembling
before
a
party
of
soldiers
who
were
loading
*NL*
their
muskets
.
Thence
,
introduced
into
a
half-subterranean
gallery
,
he
*NL*
became
,
on
the
part
of
those
who
had
brought
him
,
the
object
of
the
*NL*
grossest
insults
and
the
harshest
treatment
.
The
officers
perceived
that
*NL*
they
had
not
to
deal
with
a
gentleman
,
and
they
treated
him
like
a
very
*NL*
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
thereabouts
,
a
clerk
came
to
put
an
end
to
*NL*
his
tortures
,
but
not
to
his
anxiety
,
by
giving
the
order
to
conduct
M.
*NL*
Bonacieux
to
the
Chamber
of
Examination
.
Ordinarily
,
prisoners
were
*NL*
interrogated
in
their
cells
;
but
they
did
not
do
so
with
M.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
guards
attended
the
mercer
who
made
him
traverse
a
court
and
enter
a
*NL*
corridor
in
which
were
three
sentinels
,
opened
a
door
and
pushed
him
*NL*
unceremoniously
into
a
low
room
,
where
the
only
furniture
was
a
table
,
a
*NL*
chair
,
and
a
commissary
.
The
commissary
was
seated
in
the
chair
,
and
was
*NL*
writing
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
guards
led
the
prisoner
toward
the
table
,
and
upon
a
sign
from
*NL*
the
commissary
drew
back
so
far
as
to
be
unable
to
hear
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
,
who
had
till
this
time
held
his
head
down
over
his
*NL*
papers
,
looked
up
to
see
what
sort
of
person
he
had
to
do
with
.
This
*NL*
commissary
was
a
man
of
very
repulsive
mien
,
with
a
pointed
nose
,
with
*NL*
yellow
and
salient
cheek
bones
,
with
eyes
small
but
keen
and
*NL*
penetrating
,
and
an
expression
of
countenance
resembling
at
once
the
*NL*
polecat
and
the
fox
.
His
head
,
supported
by
a
long
and
flexible
neck
,
*NL*
issued
from
his
large
black
robe
,
balancing
itself
with
a
motion
very
*NL*
much
like
that
of
the
tortoise
thrusting
his
head
out
of
his
shell
.
He
*NL*
began
by
asking
M.
Bonacieux
his
name
,
age
,
condition
,
and
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
accused
replied
that
his
name
was
Jacques
Michel
Bonacieux
,
that
he
*NL*
was
fifty-one
years
old
,
a
retired
mercer
,
and
lived
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
,
*NL*
No.
14
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
then
,
instead
of
continuing
to
interrogate
him
,
made
him
*NL*
a
long
speech
upon
the
danger
there
is
for
an
obscure
citizen
to
meddle
*NL*
with
public
matters
.
He
complicated
this
exordium
by
an
exposition
in
*NL*
which
he
painted
the
power
and
the
deeds
of
the
cardinal
,
that
*NL*
incomparable
minister
,
that
conqueror
of
past
ministers
,
that
example
*NL*
for
ministers
to
come
--
deeds
and
power
which
none
could
thwart
with
*NL*
impunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
second
part
of
his
discourse
,
fixing
his
hawk
's
eye
upon
poor
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
he
bade
him
reflect
upon
the
gravity
of
his
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reflections
of
the
mercer
were
already
made
;
he
cursed
the
instant
*NL*
when
M.
Laporte
formed
the
idea
of
marrying
him
to
his
goddaughter
,
and
*NL*
particularly
the
moment
when
that
goddaughter
had
been
received
as
Lady
*NL*
of
the
Linen
to
her
Majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
bottom
the
character
of
M.
Bonacieux
was
one
of
profound
selfishness
*NL*
mixed
with
sordid
avarice
,
the
whole
seasoned
with
extreme
cowardice
.
*NL*
The
love
with
which
his
young
wife
had
inspired
him
was
a
secondary
*NL*
sentiment
,
and
was
not
strong
enough
to
contend
with
the
primitive
*NL*
feelings
we
have
just
enumerated
.
Bonacieux
indeed
reflected
on
what
had
*NL*
just
been
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Monsieur
Commissary
,
''
said
he
,
calmly
,
``
believe
that
I
know
and
*NL*
appreciate
,
more
than
anybody
,
the
merit
of
the
incomparable
eminence
by
*NL*
whom
we
have
the
honor
to
be
governed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
?
''
asked
the
commissary
,
with
an
air
of
doubt
.
``
If
that
is
really
*NL*
so
,
how
came
you
in
the
Bastille
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
came
there
,
or
rather
why
I
am
there
,
''
replied
Bonacieux
,
``
that
*NL*
is
entirely
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you
,
because
I
do
n't
know
myself
;
*NL*
but
to
a
certainty
it
is
not
for
having
,
knowingly
at
least
,
disobliged
*NL*
Monsieur
the
Cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
,
nevertheless
,
have
committed
a
crime
,
since
you
are
here
and
*NL*
are
accused
of
high
treason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
high
treason
!
''
cried
Bonacieux
,
terrified
;
``
of
high
treason
!
How
is
*NL*
it
possible
for
a
poor
mercer
,
who
detests
Huguenots
and
who
abhors
*NL*
Spaniards
,
to
be
accused
of
high
treason
?
Consider
,
monsieur
,
the
thing
*NL*
is
absolutely
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
''
said
the
commissary
,
looking
at
the
accused
as
if
*NL*
his
little
eyes
had
the
faculty
of
reading
to
the
very
depths
of
hearts
,
*NL*
``
you
have
a
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
the
mercer
,
in
a
tremble
,
feeling
that
it
was
*NL*
at
this
point
affairs
were
likely
to
become
perplexing
;
``
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
I
HAD
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
`
had
one
'
?
What
have
you
done
with
her
,
then
,
if
you
have
her
*NL*
no
longer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
abducted
her
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
abducted
her
?
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
inferred
from
this
``
Ah
''
that
the
affair
grew
more
and
more
*NL*
intricate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
abducted
her
,
''
added
the
commissary
;
``
and
do
you
know
the
man
*NL*
who
has
committed
this
deed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
that
I
affirm
nothing
,
Monsieur
the
Commissary
,
and
that
I
*NL*
only
suspect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
suspect
?
Come
,
answer
freely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
Bonacieux
was
in
the
greatest
perplexity
possible
.
Had
he
better
deny
*NL*
everything
or
tell
everything
?
By
denying
all
,
it
might
be
suspected
*NL*
that
he
must
know
too
much
to
avow
;
by
confessing
all
he
might
prove
his
*NL*
good
will
.
He
decided
,
then
,
to
tell
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
tall
,
dark
man
,
of
lofty
carriage
,
who
has
the
*NL*
air
of
a
great
lord
.
He
has
followed
us
several
times
,
as
I
think
,
when
*NL*
I
have
waited
for
my
wife
at
the
wicket
of
the
Louvre
to
escort
her
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
now
appeared
to
experience
a
little
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
his
name
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
to
his
name
,
I
know
nothing
about
it
;
but
if
I
were
ever
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
I
should
recognize
him
in
an
instant
,
I
will
answer
for
it
,
were
he
*NL*
among
a
thousand
persons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
the
commissary
grew
still
darker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
recognize
him
among
a
thousand
,
say
you
?
''
continued
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
''
cried
Bonacieux
,
who
saw
he
had
taken
a
false
step
,
*NL*
``
that
is
to
say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
answered
that
you
should
recognize
him
,
''
said
the
commissary
.
*NL*
``
That
is
all
very
well
,
and
enough
for
today
;
before
we
proceed
further
,
*NL*
someone
must
be
informed
that
you
know
the
ravisher
of
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
not
told
you
that
I
know
him
!
''
cried
Bonacieux
,
in
despair
.
*NL*
``
I
told
you
,
on
the
contrary
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
away
the
prisoner
,
''
said
the
commissary
to
the
two
guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
must
we
place
him
?
''
demanded
the
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
dungeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
In
the
first
one
handy
,
provided
it
is
safe
,
''
said
the
*NL*
commissary
,
with
an
indifference
which
penetrated
poor
Bonacieux
with
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
alas
!
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
misfortune
is
over
my
head
;
my
wife
*NL*
must
have
committed
some
frightful
crime
.
They
believe
me
her
*NL*
accomplice
,
and
will
punish
me
with
her
.
She
must
have
spoken
;
she
must
*NL*
have
confessed
everything
--
a
woman
is
so
weak
!
A
dungeon
!
The
first
he
*NL*
comes
to
!
That
's
it
!
A
night
is
soon
passed
;
and
tomorrow
to
the
wheel
,
*NL*
to
the
gallows
!
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
,
have
pity
on
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
listening
the
least
in
the
world
to
the
lamentations
of
M.
*NL*
Bonacieux
--
lamentations
to
which
,
besides
,
they
must
have
been
pretty
*NL*
well
accustomed
--
the
two
guards
took
the
prisoner
each
by
an
arm
,
and
*NL*
led
him
away
,
while
the
commissary
wrote
a
letter
in
haste
and
*NL*
dispatched
it
by
an
officer
in
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
could
not
close
his
eyes
;
not
because
his
dungeon
was
so
very
*NL*
disagreeable
,
but
because
his
uneasiness
was
so
great
.
He
sat
all
night
*NL*
on
his
stool
,
starting
at
the
least
noise
;
and
when
the
first
rays
of
*NL*
the
sun
penetrated
into
his
chamber
,
the
dawn
itself
appeared
to
him
to
*NL*
have
taken
funereal
tints
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
heard
his
bolts
drawn
,
and
made
a
terrified
bound
.
He
*NL*
believed
they
were
come
to
conduct
him
to
the
scaffold
;
so
that
when
he
*NL*
saw
merely
and
simply
,
instead
of
the
executioner
he
expected
,
only
his
*NL*
commissary
of
the
preceding
evening
,
attended
by
his
clerk
,
he
was
ready
*NL*
to
embrace
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
affair
has
become
more
complicated
since
yesterday
evening

*NL*
good

I

whole
truth

anger

Bonacieux

gentleman
is
in
the
company
of
Monsieur
de
Treville
's
Musketeers
.
Look
*NL*
at
his
uniform
,
Monsieur
Commissary
,
look
at
his
uniform
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
murmured
the
commissary
;
``
PARDIEU
,
that
's
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
quickly
,
and
a
messenger
,
introduced
*NL*
by
one
of
the
gatekeepers
of
the
Bastille
,
gave
a
letter
to
the
*NL*
commissary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
unhappy
woman
!
''
cried
the
commissary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
What
do
you
say
?
Of
whom
do
you
speak
?
It
is
not
of
my
wife
,
I
*NL*
hope
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
of
her
.
Yours
is
a
pretty
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
the
agitated
mercer
,
``
do
me
the
pleasure
,
monsieur
,
to
tell
*NL*
me
how
my
own
proper
affair
can
become
worse
by
anything
my
wife
does
*NL*
while
I
am
in
prison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
that
which
she
does
is
part
of
a
plan
concerted
between
you
--
of
*NL*
an
infernal
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,
Monsieur
Commissary
,
that
you
are
in
the
profoundest
*NL*
error
,
that
I
know
nothing
in
the
world
about
what
my
wife
had
to
do
,
*NL*
that
I
am
entirely
a
stranger
to
what
she
has
done
;
and
that
if
she
has
*NL*
committed
any
follies
,
I
renounce
her
,
I
abjure
her
,
I
curse
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
Athos
to
the
commissary
,
``
if
you
have
no
more
need
of
me
,
*NL*
send
me
somewhere
.
Your
Monsieur
Bonacieux
is
very
tiresome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissary
designated
by
the
same
gesture
Athos
and
Bonacieux
,
``
Let
*NL*
them
be
guarded
more
closely
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
Athos
,
with
his
habitual
calmness
,
``
if
it
be
Monsieur
*NL*
d'Artagnan
who
is
concerned
in
this
matter
,
I
do
not
perceive
how
I
can
*NL*
take
his
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
I
bade
you
,
''
cried
the
commissary
,
``
and
preserve
absolute
*NL*
secrecy
.
You
understand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
followed
his
guards
silently
,
while
M.
*NL*
Bonacieux
uttered
lamentations
enough
to
break
the
heart
of
a
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
locked
the
mercer
in
the
same
dungeon
where
he
had
passed
the
*NL*
night
,
and
left
him
to
himself
during
the
day
.
Bonacieux
wept
all
day
,
*NL*
like
a
true
mercer
,
not
being
at
all
a
military
man
,
as
he
himself
*NL*
informed
us
.
In
the
evening
,
about
nine
o'clock
,
at
the
moment
he
had
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
bed
,
he
heard
steps
in
his
corridor
.
These
*NL*
steps
drew
near
to
his
dungeon
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
the
guards
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
me
,
''
said
an
officer
,
who
came
up
behind
the
guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follow
you
!
''
cried
Bonacieux
,
``
follow
you
at
this
hour
!
Where
,
my
God
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
we
have
orders
to
lead
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
not
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
nevertheless
,
the
only
one
we
can
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
murmured
the
poor
mercer
,
``
now
,
indeed
,
I
am
*NL*
lost
!
''
And
he
followed
the
guards
who
came
for
him
,
mechanically
and
*NL*
without
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
along
the
same
corridor
as
before
,
crossed
one
court
,
then
a
*NL*
second
side
of
a
building
;
at
length
,
at
the
gate
of
the
entrance
court
*NL*
he
found
a
carriage
surrounded
by
four
guards
on
horseback
.
They
made
*NL*
him
enter
this
carriage
,
the
officer
placed
himself
by
his
side
,
the
*NL*
door
was
locked
,
and
they
were
left
in
a
rolling
prison
.
The
carriage
*NL*
was
put
in
motion
as
slowly
as
a
funeral
car
.
Through
the
closely
*NL*
fastened
windows
the
prisoner
could
perceive
the
houses
and
the
*NL*
pavement
,
that
was
all
;
but
,
true
Parisian
as
he
was
,
Bonacieux
could
*NL*
recognize
every
street
by
the
milestones
,
the
signs
,
and
the
lamps
.
At
*NL*
the
moment
of
arriving
at
St.
Paul
--
the
spot
where
such
as
were
*NL*
condemned
at
the
Bastille
were
executed
--
he
was
near
fainting
and
*NL*
crossed
himself
twice
.
He
thought
the
carriage
was
about
to
stop
there
.
*NL*
The
carriage
,
however
,
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
on
,
a
still
greater
terror
seized
him
on
passing
by
the
cemetery
*NL*
of
St.
Jean
,
where
state
criminals
were
buried
.
One
thing
,
however
,
*NL*
reassured
him
;
he
remembered
that
before
they
were
buried
their
heads
*NL*
were
generally
cut
off
,
and
he
felt
that
his
head
was
still
on
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
But
when
he
saw
the
carriage
take
the
way
to
La
Greve
,
when
*NL*
he
perceived
the
pointed
roof
of
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
and
the
carriage
*NL*
passed
under
the
arcade
,
he
believed
it
was
over
with
him
.
He
wished
to
*NL*
confess
to
the
officer
,
and
upon
his
refusal
,
uttered
such
pitiable
*NL*
cries
that
the
officer
told
him
that
if
he
continued
to
deafen
him
thus
,
*NL*
he
should
put
a
gag
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
measure
somewhat
reassured
Bonacieux
.
If
they
meant
to
execute
him
*NL*
at
La
Greve
,
it
could
scarcely
be
worth
while
to
gag
him
,
as
they
had
*NL*
nearly
reached
the
place
of
execution
.
Indeed
,
the
carriage
crossed
the
*NL*
fatal
spot
without
stopping
.
There
remained
,
then
,
no
other
place
to
*NL*
fear
but
the
Traitor
's
Cross
;
the
carriage
was
taking
the
direct
road
to
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
;
it
was
at
the
Traitor
's
Cross
*NL*
that
lesser
criminals
were
executed
.
Bonacieux
had
flattered
himself
in
*NL*
believing
himself
worthy
of
St.
Paul
or
of
the
Place
de
Greve
;
it
was
at
*NL*
the
Traitor
's
Cross
that
his
journey
and
his
destiny
were
about
to
end
!
*NL*
He
could
not
yet
see
that
dreadful
cross
,
but
he
felt
somehow
as
if
it
*NL*
were
coming
to
meet
him
.
When
he
was
within
twenty
paces
of
it
,
he
heard
*NL*
a
noise
of
people
and
the
carriage
stopped
.
This
was
more
than
poor
*NL*
Bonacieux
could
endure
,
depressed
as
he
was
by
the
successive
emotions
*NL*
which
he
had
experienced
;
he
uttered
a
feeble
groan
which
might
have
*NL*
been
taken
for
the
last
sigh
of
a
dying
man
,
and
fainted
.

THE
MAN
OF
MEUNG
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
caused
,
not
by
the
expectation
of
a
man
to
be
hanged
,
but
*NL*
by
the
contemplation
of
a
man
who
was
hanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
,
which
had
been
stopped
for
a
minute
,
resumed
its
way
,
*NL*
passed
through
the
crowd
,
threaded
the
Rue
St.
Honore
,
turned
into
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Bons
Enfants
,
and
stopped
before
a
low
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
;
two
guards
received
Bonacieux
in
their
arms
from
the
*NL*
officer
who
supported
him
.
They
carried
him
through
an
alley
,
up
a
*NL*
flight
of
stairs
,
and
deposited
him
in
an
antechamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
movements
had
been
effected
mechanically
,
as
far
as
he
was
*NL*
concerned
.
He
had
walked
as
one
walks
in
a
dream
;
he
had
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
objects
as
through
a
fog
.
His
ears
had
perceived
sounds
without
*NL*
comprehending
them
;
he
might
have
been
executed
at
that
moment
without
*NL*
his
making
a
single
gesture
in
his
own
defense
or
uttering
a
cry
to
*NL*
implore
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
on
the
bench
,
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
wall
and
his
*NL*
hands
hanging
down
,
exactly
on
the
spot
where
the
guards
placed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
looking
around
him
,
however
,
as
he
could
perceive
no
threatening
*NL*
object
,
as
nothing
indicated
that
he
ran
any
real
danger
,
as
the
bench
*NL*
was
comfortably
covered
with
a
well-stuffed
cushion
,
as
the
wall
was
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
beautiful
Cordova
leather
,
and
as
large
red
damask
*NL*
curtains
,
fastened
back
by
gold
clasps
,
floated
before
the
window
,
he
*NL*
perceived
by
degrees
that
his
fear
was
exaggerated
,
and
he
began
to
turn
*NL*
his
head
to
the
right
and
the
left
,
upward
and
downward
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
movement
,
which
nobody
opposed
,
he
resumed
a
little
courage
,
and
*NL*
ventured
to
draw
up
one
leg
and
then
the
other
.
At
length
,
with
the
help
*NL*
of
his
two
hands
he
lifted
himself
from
the
bench
,
and
found
himself
on
*NL*
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
an
officer
with
a
pleasant
face
opened
a
door
,
continued
*NL*
to
exchange
some
words
with
a
person
in
the
next
chamber
and
then
came
*NL*
up
to
the
prisoner
.
``
Is
your
name
Bonacieux
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Monsieur
Officer
,
''
stammered
the
mercer
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
``
at
*NL*
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
moved
out
of
the
way
to
let
the
mercer
pass
.
The
latter
obeyed
*NL*
without
reply
,
and
entered
the
chamber
,
where
he
appeared
to
be
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
large
cabinet
,
close
and
stifling
,
with
the
walls
furnished
*NL*
with
arms
offensive
and
defensive
,
and
in
which
there
was
already
a
*NL*
fire
,
although
it
was
scarcely
the
end
of
the
month
of
September
.
A
*NL*
square
table
,
covered
with
books
and
papers
,
upon
which
was
unrolled
an
*NL*
immense
plan
of
the
city
of
La
Rochelle
,
occupied
the
center
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
before
the
chimney
was
a
man
of
middle
height
,
of
a
haughty
,
*NL*
proud
mien
;
with
piercing
eyes
,
a
large
brow
,
and
a
thin
face
,
which
was
*NL*
made
still
longer
by
a
ROYAL
-LRB-
or
IMPERIAL
,
as
it
is
now
called
-RRB-
,
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
pair
of
mustaches
.
Although
this
man
was
scarcely
*NL*
thirty-six
or
thirty-seven
years
of
age
,
hair
,
mustaches
,
and
royal
,
all
*NL*
began
to
be
gray
.
This
man
,
except
a
sword
,
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
*NL*
soldier
;
and
his
buff
boots
,
still
slightly
covered
with
dust
,
indicated
*NL*
that
he
had
been
on
horseback
in
the
course
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
Armand
Jean
Duplessis
,
Cardinal
de
Richelieu
;
not
such
as
*NL*
he
is
now
represented
--
broken
down
like
an
old
man
,
suffering
like
a
*NL*
martyr
,
his
body
bent
,
his
voice
failing
,
buried
in
a
large
armchair
as
*NL*
in
an
anticipated
tomb
;
no
longer
living
but
by
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
genius
,
and
no
longer
maintaining
the
struggle
with
Europe
but
by
the
*NL*
eternal
application
of
his
thoughts
--
but
such
as
he
really
was
at
this
*NL*
period
;
that
is
to
say
,
an
active
and
gallant
cavalier
,
already
weak
of
*NL*
body
,
but
sustained
by
that
moral
power
which
made
of
him
one
of
the
*NL*
most
extraordinary
men
that
ever
lived
,
preparing
,
after
having
*NL*
supported
the
Duc
de
Nevers
in
his
duchy
of
Mantua
,
after
having
taken
*NL*
Nimes
,
Castres
,
and
Uzes
,
to
drive
the
English
from
the
Isle
of
Re
and
*NL*
lay
siege
to
La
Rochelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
sight
,
nothing
denoted
the
cardinal
;
and
it
was
impossible
for
*NL*
those
who
did
not
know
his
face
to
guess
in
whose
presence
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
mercer
remained
standing
at
the
door
,
while
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
personage
we
have
just
described
were
fixed
upon
him
,
and
appeared
to
*NL*
wish
to
penetrate
even
into
the
depths
of
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
that
Bonacieux
?
''
asked
he
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
.
Give
me
those
papers
,
and
leave
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
took
from
the
table
the
papers
pointed
out
,
gave
them
to
him
*NL*
who
asked
for
them
,
bowed
to
the
ground
,
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
recognized
in
these
papers
his
interrogatories
of
the
*NL*
Bastille
.
From
time
to
time
the
man
by
the
chimney
raised
his
eyes
from
*NL*
the
writings
,
and
plunged
them
like
poniards
into
the
heart
of
the
poor
*NL*
mercer
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
ten
minutes
of
reading
and
ten
seconds
of
examination
,
the
*NL*
cardinal
was
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
head
has
never
conspired
,
''
murmured
he
,
``
but
it
matters
not
;
we
*NL*
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
accused
of
high
treason
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
been
told
already
,
monseigneur
,
''
cried
Bonacieux
,
giving
his
*NL*
interrogator
the
title
he
had
heard
the
officer
give
him
,
``
but
I
swear
*NL*
to
you
that
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
repressed
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
conspired
with
your
wife
,
with
Madame
de
Chevreuse
,
and
with
*NL*
my
Lord
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
monseigneur
,
''
responded
the
mercer
,
``
I
have
heard
her
pronounce
*NL*
all
those
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
what
occasion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
that
the
Cardinal
de
Richelieu
had
drawn
the
Duke
of
*NL*

!
''
said
Bonacieux
,
hesitating
to
take
the
*NL*
purse
,
fearing
,
doubtless
,
that
this
pretended
gift
was
but
a
*NL*
pleasantry
.
``
But
you
are
able
to
have
me
arrested
,
you
are
able
to
have
*NL*
me
tortured
,
you
are
able
to
have
me
hanged
;
you
are
the
master
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
have
the
least
word
to
say
.
Pardon
you
,
monseigneur
!
You
*NL*
can
not
mean
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
you
are
generous
in
this
matter
.
I
see
*NL*
it
and
I
thank
you
for
it
.
Thus
,
then
,
you
will
take
this
bag
,
and
you
*NL*
will
go
away
without
being
too
malcontent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
away
enchanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
,
then
,
or
rather
,
AU
REVOIR
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
Monseigneur
wishes
,
I
shall
be
firmly
at
the
orders
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
often
,
be
assured
,
for
I
have
found
your
conversation
*NL*
quite
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Monseigneur
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
AU
REVOIR
,
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
AU
REVOIR
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
cardinal
made
him
a
sign
with
his
hand
,
to
which
Bonacieux
*NL*
replied
by
bowing
to
the
ground
.
He
then
went
out
backward
,
and
when
he
*NL*
was
in
the
antechamber
the
cardinal
heard
him
,
in
his
enthusiasm
,
crying
*NL*
aloud
,
``
Long
life
to
the
Monseigneur
!
Long
life
to
his
Eminence
!
Long
*NL*
life
to
the
great
cardinal
!
''
The
cardinal
listened
with
a
smile
to
this
*NL*
vociferous
manifestation
of
the
feelings
of
M.
Bonacieux
;
and
then
,
when
*NL*
Bonacieux
's
cries
were
no
longer
audible
,
``
Good
!
''
said
he
,
``
that
man
*NL*
would
henceforward
lay
down
his
life
for
me
.
''
And
the
cardinal
began
to
*NL*
examine
with
the
greatest
attention
the
map
of
La
Rochelle
,
which
,
as
we
*NL*
have
said
,
lay
open
on
the
desk
,
tracing
with
a
pencil
the
line
in
which
*NL*
the
famous
dyke
was
to
pass
which
,
eighteen
months
later
,
shut
up
the
*NL*
port
of
the
besieged
city
.
As
he
was
in
the
deepest
of
his
strategic
*NL*
meditations
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Rochefort
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
cardinal
,
eagerly
,
rising
with
a
promptitude
which
*NL*
proved
the
degree
of
importance
he
attached
to
the
commission
with
which
*NL*
he
had
charged
the
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
a
young
woman
of
about
twenty-six

*NL*
twenty-eight
years
of
age

forty

have
*NL*
indeed
lodged
at
the
two
houses
pointed
out
by
your

the

woman
left
last
night
,
and
the
man
this
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
they

cried
the
cardinal
,
looking
at
the
clock
;
``
and
now
it
is
*NL*
too
late
to
have
them
pursued

*NL*
``
What

*NL*
*NL*

Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
man

what
has
your

him

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Bonacieux

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Comte
de
Rochefort
bowed
like
a
man
who
acknowledges
the
superiority
*NL*
of
the
master
as
great
,
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
the
cardinal
seated
himself
again
and
wrote
a
letter
,
which
*NL*
he
secured
with
his
special
seal
.
Then
he
rang
.
The
officer
entered
for
*NL*
the
fourth
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
Vitray
to
come
to
me
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
tell
him
to
get
ready
for
a
*NL*
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
after
,
the
man
he
asked
for
was
before
him
,
booted
and
*NL*
spurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vitray

said
he
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
messenger
,
without
replying
a
single
word
,
bowed
,
took
the
letter
,
*NL*
with
the
order
for
the

retired

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
after
these
events
had
taken
place
,
Athos
not
having
*NL*
reappeared
,
M.
de
Treville
was
informed
by
d'Artagnan
and
Porthos
of
the
*NL*
circumstance
.
As
to
Aramis
,
he
had
asked
for
leave
of
absence
for
five
*NL*
days
,
and
was
gone
,
it
was
said
,
to
Rouen
on
family
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
was
the
father
of
his
soldiers
.
The
lowest
or
the
least
*NL*
known
of
them
,
as
soon
as
he
assumed
the
uniform
of
the
company
,
was
as
*NL*
sure
of
his
aid
and
support
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repaired
,
then
,
instantly
to
the
office
of
the
LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL
.
*NL*
The
officer
who
commanded
the
post
of
the
Red
Cross
was
sent
for
,
and
by
*NL*
successive
inquiries
they
learned
that
Athos
was
then
lodged
in
Fort
*NL*
l'Eveque
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
had
passed
through
all
the
examinations
we
have
seen
Bonacieux
*NL*
undergo
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
present
at
the
scene
in
which
the
two
captives
were
confronted
*NL*
with
each
other
.
Athos
,
who
had
till
that
time
said
nothing
for
fear
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
,
interrupted
in
his
turn
,
should
not
have
the
time
*NL*
necessary
,
from
this
moment
declared
that
his
name
was
Athos
,
and
not
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
He
added
that
he
did
not
know
either
M.
or
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
*NL*
that
he
had
never
spoken
to
the
one
or
the
other
;
that
he
had
come
,
at
*NL*
about
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
friend
M.
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
but
that
till
that
hour
he
had
been
at
M.
de
Treville
's
,
*NL*
where
he
had
dined
.
``
Twenty
witnesses
,
''
added
he
,
``
could
attest
the
*NL*
fact
''
;
and
he
named
several
distinguished
gentlemen
,
and
among
them
was
*NL*
M.
le
Duc
de
la
Tremouille
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
commissary
was
as
much
bewildered
as
the
first
had
been
by
*NL*
the
simple
and
firm
declaration
of
the
Musketeer
,
upon
whom
he
was
*NL*
anxious
to
take
the
revenge
which
men
of
the
robe
like
at
all
times
to
*NL*
gain
over
men
of
the
sword
;
but
the
name
of
M.
de
Treville
,
and
that
of
*NL*
M.
de
la
Tremouille
,
commanded
a
little
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
was
then
sent
to
the
cardinal
;
but
unfortunately
the
cardinal
was
*NL*
at
the
Louvre
with
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
precisely
at
this
moment
that
M.
de
Treville
,
on
leaving
the
*NL*
residence
of
the
LIEUTENANT-CRIMINEL
and
the
governor
of
Fort
l'Eveque
*NL*
without
being
able
to
find
Athos
,
arrived
at
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
captain
of
the
Musketeers
,
M.
de
Treville
had
the
right
of
entry
at
*NL*
all
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
well
known
how
violent
the
king
's
prejudices
were
against
the
*NL*
queen
,
and
how
carefully
these
prejudices
were
kept
up
by
the
cardinal
,
*NL*
who
in
affairs
of
intrigue
mistrusted
women
infinitely
more
than
men
.
*NL*
One
of
the
grand
causes
of
this
prejudice
was
the
friendship
of
Anne
of
*NL*
Austria
for
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
.
These
two
women
gave
him
more
uneasiness
*NL*
than
the
war
with
Spain
,
the
quarrel
with
England
,
or
the
embarrassment
*NL*
of
the
finances
.
In
his
eyes
and
to
his
conviction
,
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
*NL*
not
only
served
the
queen
in
her
political
intrigues
,
but
,
what
*NL*
tormented
him
still
more
,
in
her
amorous
intrigues
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
word
the
cardinal
spoke
of
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
--
who
,
though
*NL*
exiled
to
Tours
and
believed
to
be
in
that
city
,
had
come
to
Paris
,
*NL*
remained
there
five
days
,
and
outwitted
the
police
--
the
king
flew
into
a
*NL*
furious
passion
.
Capricious
and
unfaithful
,
the
king
wished
to
be
called
*NL*
Louis
the
Just
and
Louis
the
Chaste
.
Posterity
will
find
a
difficulty
in
*NL*
understanding
this
character
,
which
history
explains
only
by
facts
and
*NL*
never
by
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
cardinal
added
that
not
only
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
had
been
in
*NL*
Paris
,
but
still
further
,
that
the
queen
had
renewed
with
her
one
of
*NL*
those
mysterious
correspondences
which
at
that
time
was
named
a
CABAL
;
*NL*
when
he
affirmed
that
he
,
the
cardinal
,
was
about
to
unravel
the
most
*NL*
closely
twisted
thread
of
this
intrigue
;
that
at
the
moment
of
arresting
*NL*
in
the
very
act
,
with
all
the
proofs
about
her
,
the
queen
's
emissary
to
*NL*
the
exiled
duchess
,
a
Musketeer
had
dared
to
interrupt
the
course
of
*NL*
justice
violently
,
by
falling
sword
in
hand
upon
the
honest
men
of
the
*NL*
law
,
charged
with
investigating
impartially
the
whole
affair
in
order
to
*NL*
place
it
before
the
eyes
of
the
king
--
Louis
XIII
could
not
contain
*NL*
himself
,
and
he
made
a
step
toward
the
queen
's
apartment
with
that
pale
*NL*
and
mute
indignation
which
,
when
it
broke
out
,
led
this
prince
to
the
*NL*
commission
of
the
most
pitiless
cruelty
.
And
yet
,
in
all
this
,
the
*NL*
cardinal
had
not
yet
said
a
word
about
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
M.
de
Treville
entered
,
cool
,
polite
,
and
in
*NL*
irreproachable
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
Informed
of
what
had
passed
by
the
presence
of
the
cardinal
and
the
*NL*
alteration
in
the
king
's
countenance
,
M.
de
Treville
felt
himself
*NL*
something
like
Samson
before
the
Philistines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XIII
had
already
placed
his
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
;
at
the
*NL*
noise
of
M.
de
Treville
's
entrance
he
turned
round
.
``
You
arrive
in
good
*NL*
time
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
king
,
who
,
when
his
passions
were
raised
to
a
*NL*
certain
point
,
could
not
dissemble
;
``
I
have
learned
some
fine
things
*NL*
concerning
your
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
Treville
,
coldly
,
``
I
have
some
pretty
things
to
tell
your
*NL*
Majesty
concerning
these
gownsmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
the
king
,
with
hauteur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
to
inform
your
Majesty
,
''
continued
M.
de
Treville
,
in
*NL*
the
same
tone
,
``
that
a
party
of
PROCUREURS
,
commissaries
,
and
men
of
the
*NL*
police
--
very
estimable
people
,
but
very
inveterate
,
as
it
appears
,
*NL*
against
the
uniform
--
have
taken
upon
themselves
to
arrest
in
a
house
,
to
*NL*
lead
away
through
the
open
street
,
and
throw
into
Fort
l'Eveque
,
all
*NL*
upon
an
order
which
they
have
refused
to
show
me
,
one
of
my
,
or
rather
*NL*
your
Musketeers
,
sire
,
of
irreproachable
conduct
,
of
an
almost
*NL*
illustrious
reputation
,
and
whom
your
Majesty
knows
favorably
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos

''
said
the
king
,
mechanically
;
``
yes
,
certainly
I
know
that
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
Majesty
remember
,
''
said
Treville
,
``
that
Monsieur
Athos
is
the
*NL*
Musketeer
who
,
in
the
annoying
duel
which
you
are
acquainted
with
,
had
*NL*
the
misfortune
to
wound
Monsieur
de
Cahusac
so
seriously
.
A
PROPOS

*NL*

,
''
continued
Treville
,
addressing
the
cardinal
,
``
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Cahusac
is
quite
recovered
,
is
he
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
biting
his
lips
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos
,
then
,
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
one
of
his
friends
absent
at
the
*NL*
time

continued
Treville
,
``
to
a
young
Bearnais

a
cadet
in
his

the
company

,
but
scarcely
had
*NL*
he
arrived
at
his
friend

and
taken
up
a
book
,
while
waiting
his
*NL*
return
,
when
a
mixed
crowd
of
bailiffs
and
soldiers
came
and
laid
siege
*NL*
to
the
house
,
broke
open
several
doors

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
made
the
king
a
sign
,
which
signified
,
``
That
was
on
account

the
affair
about

I
spoke

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

interrupted
the

aloud

The

imprudent

M.

launched
it
with

knowledge

He

suppliant

*NL*
Treville
bowed
very
respectfully

with
a
joy
that
was
not

with

fear
;
he
would
have
preferred
an
obstinate
resistance

signed

carried
it
away

without
delay

he
was
about

leave

the
cardinal
gave
*NL*
him
a
friendly
smile

said
,

more

M

made
his
entrance
triumphantly
into

whence
he
delivered
the
Musketeer

peaceful
indifference
had
not

abandoned

him

As
to
the
rest

M.

had
good
reason
to
mistrust
the

to
think
that
all
was
not
over

for
scarcely
had
the
captain

closed
the
door
after
him

his

said
to

said
the

loving

have
my

*NL*
``
I

political

I
am
sure
that

guilty

let
her
tremble

*NL*

Indeed

said
the
cardinal
,

whatever
repugnance
I
may
have
to
*NL*
directing
my
mind
to
such
a
treason

your
Majesty

me
to
think
of
*NL*
it

,
according
to
your
Majesty

command
,
I
have
*NL*
frequently
interrogated

told

this

the

*NL*
her
Majesty
sat
up
very
late

this

she
wept

she
was
writing
all

But
how
to

It

me

neither
your

himself

*NL*
*NL*

How

the

And
Louis
XIII
,
opening
the
door
of
communication
,
passed
into
the
*NL*
corridor
which
led
from
his
apartments
to
those
of
Anne
of
Austria
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
was
in
the
midst
of
her
women
--
Mme.
de
Guitaut
,
Mme.
de
Sable
,
*NL*
Mme.
de
Montbazon
,
and
Mme.
de
Guemene
.
In
a
corner
was
the
Spanish
*NL*
companion
,
Donna
Estafania
,
who
had
followed
her
from
Madrid
.
Mme.
*NL*
Guemene
was
reading
aloud
,
and
everybody
was
listening
to
her
with
*NL*
attention
with
the
exception
of
the
queen
,
who
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
desired
this
reading
in
order
that
she
might
be
able
,
while
feigning
to
*NL*
listen
,
to
pursue
the
thread
of
her
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
,
gilded
as
they
were
by
a
last
reflection
of
love
,
were
*NL*
not
the
less
sad
.
Anne
of
Austria
,
deprived
of
the
confidence
of
her
*NL*
husband
,
pursued
by
the
hatred
of
the
cardinal
,
who
could
not
pardon
her
*NL*
for
having
repulsed
a
more
tender
feeling
,
having
before
her
eyes
the
*NL*
example
of
the
queen-mother
whom
that
hatred
had
tormented
all
her
*NL*
life
--
though
Marie
de
Medicis
,
if
the
memoirs
of
the
time
are
to
be
*NL*
believed
,
had
begun
by
according
to
the
cardinal
that
sentiment
which
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
always
refused
him
--
Anne
of
Austria
had
seen
her
most
*NL*
devoted
servants
fall
around
her
,
her
most
intimate
confidants
,
her
*NL*
dearest
favorites
.
Like
those
unfortunate
persons
endowed
with
a
fatal
*NL*
gift
,
she
brought
misfortune
upon
everything
she
touched
.
Her
friendship
*NL*
was
a
fatal
sign
which
called
down
persecution
.
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
and
*NL*
Mme.
de
Bernet
were
exiled
,
and
Laporte
did
not
conceal
from
his
*NL*
mistress
that
he
expected
to
be
arrested
every
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
moment
when
she
was
plunged
in
the
deepest
and
darkest
of
*NL*
these
reflections
that
the
door
of
the
chamber
opened
,
and
the
king
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
hushed
herself
instantly
.
All
the
ladies
rose
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
profound
silence
.
As
to
the
king
,
he
made
no
demonstration
of
*NL*
politeness
,
only
stopping
before
the
queen
.
``
Madame
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
are
*NL*
about
to
receive
a
visit
from
the
chancellor
,
who
will
communicate
*NL*
certain
matters
to
you
with
which
I
have
charged
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
queen
,
who
was
constantly
threatened
with
divorce
,
*NL*
exile
,
and
trial
even
,
turned
pale
under
her
rouge
,
and
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
saying
,
``
But
why
this
visit
,
sire
?
What
can
the
chancellor
*NL*
have
to
say
to
me
that
your
Majesty
could
not
say
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
turned
upon
his
heel
without
reply
,
and
almost
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
the
captain
of
the
Guards
,
M.
de
Guitant
,
announced
the
visit
of
*NL*
the
chancellor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
chancellor
appeared
,
the
king
had
already
gone
out
by
another
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chancellor
entered
,
half
smiling
,
half
blushing
.
As
we
shall
*NL*
probably
meet
with
him
again
in
the
course
of
our
history
,
it
may
be
*NL*
well
for
our
readers
to
be
made
at
once
acquainted
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
chancellor
was
a
pleasant
man
.
He
was
Des
Roches
le
Masle
,
canon
of
*NL*
Notre
Dame
,
who
had
formerly
been
valet
of
a
bishop
,
who
introduced
him
*NL*
to
his
Eminence
as
a
perfectly
devout
man
.
The
cardinal
trusted
him
,
and
*NL*
therein
found
his
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
stories
related
of
him
,
and
among
them
this
.
After
a
wild
*NL*
youth
,
he
had
retired
into
a
convent
,
there
to
expiate
,
at
least
for
*NL*
some
time
,
the
follies
of
adolescence
.
On
entering
this
holy
place
,
the
*NL*
poor
penitent
was
unable
to
shut
the
door
so
close
as
to
prevent
the
*NL*
passions
he
fled
from
entering
with
him
.
He
was
incessantly
attacked
by
*NL*
them
,
and
the
superior
,
to
whom
he
had
confided
this
misfortune
,
wishing
*NL*
as
much
as
in
him
lay
to
free
him
from
them
,
had
advised
him
,
in
order
*NL*
to
conjure
away
the
tempting
demon
,
to
have
recourse
to
the
bell
rope
,
*NL*
and
ring
with
all
his
might
.
At
the
denunciating
sound
,
the
monks
would
*NL*
be
rendered
aware
that
temptation
was
besieging
a
brother
,
and
all
the
*NL*
community
would
go
to
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
appeared
good
to
the
future
chancellor
.
He
conjured
the
evil
*NL*
spirit
with
abundance
of
prayers
offered
up
by
the
monks
.
But
the
devil
*NL*
does
not
suffer
himself
to
be
easily
dispossessed
from
a
place
in
which
*NL*
he
has
fixed
his
garrison
.
In
proportion
as
they
redoubled
the
exorcisms
*NL*
he
redoubled
the
temptations
;
so
that
day
and
night
the
bell
was
ringing
*NL*
full
swing
,
announcing
the
extreme
desire
for
mortification
which
the
*NL*
penitent
experienced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monks
had
no
longer
an
instant
of
repose
.
By
day
they
did
nothing
*NL*
but
ascend
and
descend
the
steps
which
led
to
the
chapel
;
at
night
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
complines
and
matins
,
they
were
further
obliged
to
leap
*NL*
twenty
times
out
of
their
beds
and
prostrate
themselves
on
the
floor
of
*NL*
their
cells
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
known
whether
it
was
the
devil
who
gave
way
,
or
the
monks
who
*NL*
grew
tired
;
but
within
three
months
the
penitent
reappeared
in
the
world
*NL*
with
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
terrible
POSSESSED
that
ever
*NL*
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
convent
he
entered
into
the
magistracy
,
became
president
*NL*
on
the
place
of
his
uncle
,
embraced
the
cardinal
's
party
,
which
did
not
*NL*
prove
want
of
sagacity
,
became
chancellor
,
served
his
Eminence
with
zeal
*NL*
in
his
hatred
against
the
queen-mother
and
his
vengeance
against
Anne
of
*NL*
Austria
,
stimulated
the
judges
in
the
affair
of
Calais
,
encouraged
the
*NL*
attempts
of
M.
de
Laffemas
,
chief
gamekeeper
of
France
;
then
,
at
length
,
*NL*
invested
with
the
entire
confidence
of
the
cardinal
--
a
confidence
which
*NL*
he
had
so
well
earned
--
he
received
the
singular
commission
for
the
*NL*
execution
of
which
he
presented
himself
in
the
queen
's
apartments
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
was
still
standing
when
he
entered
;
but
scarcely
had
she
*NL*
perceived
him
then
she
reseated
herself
in
her
armchair
,
and
made
a
sign
*NL*
to
her
women
to
resume
their
cushions
and
stools
,
and
with
an
air
of
*NL*
supreme
hauteur
,
said
,
``
What
do
you
desire
,
monsieur
,
and
with
what
*NL*
object
do
you
present

*NL*
For
form
's
sake
the
chancellor
paid
a
visit
to
the
pieces
of
furniture
*NL*
named
;
but
he
well
knew
that
it
was
not
in
a
piece
of
furniture
that
the
*NL*
queen
would
place
the
important
letter
she
had
written
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
chancellor
had
opened
and
shut
twenty
times
the
drawers
of
the
*NL*
secretaries
,
it
became
necessary
,
whatever
hesitation
he
might
*NL*
experience
--
it
became
necessary
,
I
say
,
to
come
to
the
conclusion
of
the
*NL*
affair
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
search
the
queen
herself
.
The
chancellor
*NL*
advanced
,
therefore
,
toward
Anne
of
Austria
,
and
said
with
a
very
*NL*
perplexed
and
embarrassed
air
,
``
And
now
it
remains
for
me
to
make
the
*NL*
principal
examination

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
the
queen
,
who
did
not
understand
,
or
rather
was
*NL*
not
willing
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His

not

This

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would

said
Anne

Austria
,
*NL*
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
,
and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
the
*NL*
chancellor
with
an
expression
almost
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*

And
the

laid

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

*NL*

I
repeat

I
am

reclaiming

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
queen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be

*NL*

*NL*
``
I

No

no

''
cried
the
queen
,
in
*NL*
whom
the
imperious
blood
of
Spain
and
Austria
began
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chancellor
made
a
profound
reverence
.
Then
,
with
the
intention
quite
*NL*
patent
of
not
drawing
back
a
foot
from
the
accomplishment
of
the
*NL*
commission
with
which
he
was
charged
,
and
as
the
attendant
of
an
*NL*
executioner
might
have
done
in
the
chamber
of
torture
,
he
approached
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
,
from
whose
eyes
at
the
same
instant
sprang
tears
of
*NL*
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
great
beauty
.
The
commission
might
*NL*
well
be
called
delicate
;
and
the
king
had
reached
,
in
his
jealousy
of
*NL*
Buckingham
,
the
point
of
not
being
jealous
of
anyone
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
doubt
the
chancellor
Seguier
looked
about
at
that
moment
for
the
*NL*
rope
of
the
famous
bell
;
but
not
finding
it
he
summoned
his
resolution
,
*NL*
and
stretched
forth
his
hands
toward
the
place
where
the
queen
had
*NL*
acknowledged
the
paper
was
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
took
one
step
backward
,
became
so
pale
that
it
might
be
*NL*
said
she
was
dying
,
and
leaning
with
her
left
hand
upon
a
table
behind
*NL*
her
to
keep
herself
from
falling
,
she
with
her
right
hand
drew
the
paper
*NL*
from
her
bosom
and
held
it
out
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
monsieur
,
there
is
that
letter
!
''
cried
the
queen
,
with
a
broken
*NL*
and
trembling
voice
;
``
take
it
,
and
deliver
me
from
your
odious
*NL*
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chancellor
,
who
,
on
his
part
,
trembled
with
an
emotion
easily
to
be
*NL*
conceived
,
took
the
letter
,
bowed
to
the
ground
,
and
retired
.
The
door
*NL*
was
scarcely
closed
upon
him
,
when
the
queen
sank
,
half
fainting
,
into
*NL*
the
arms
of
her
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chancellor
carried
the
letter
to
the
king
without
having
read
a
*NL*
single
word
of
it
.
The
king
took
it
with
a
trembling
hand
,
looked
for
*NL*
the
address
,
which
was
wanting
,
became
very
pale
,
opened
it
slowly
,
then
*NL*
seeing
by
the
first
words
that
it
was
addressed
to
the
King
of
Spain
,
he
*NL*
read
it
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nothing
but
a
plan
of
attack
against
the
cardinal
.
The
queen
*NL*
pressed
her
brother
and
the
Emperor
of
Austria
to
appear
to
be
wounded
,
*NL*
as
they
really
were
,
by
the
policy
of
Richelieu
--
the
eternal
object
of
*NL*
which
was
the
abasement
of
the
house
of
Austria
--
to
declare
war
against
*NL*
France
,
and
as
a
condition
of
peace
,
to
insist
upon
the
dismissal
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
;
but
as
to
love
,
there
was
not
a
single
word
about
it
in
all
*NL*
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
,
quite
delighted
,
inquired
if
the
cardinal
was
still
at
the
*NL*
Louvre
;
he
was
told
that
his
Eminence
awaited
the
orders
of
his
Majesty
*NL*
in
the
business
cabinet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
went
straight
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Duke
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
were
right
and
I
was
wrong
.
The
whole
*NL*
intrigue
is
political
,
and
there
is
not
the
least
question
of
love
in
*NL*
this
letter
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
abundant
question
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
took
the
letter
,
and
read
it
with
the
greatest
attention
;
*NL*
then
,
when
he
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
it
,
he
read
it
a
second
time
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
Majesty
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
see
how
far
my
enemies
go
;
they
*NL*
menace
you
with
two
wars
if
you
do
not
dismiss
me
.
In
your
place
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
sire
,
I
should
yield
to
such
powerful
instance
;
and
on
my
part
,
*NL*
it
would
be
a
real
happiness
to
withdraw
from
public
affairs
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say

my
health

sinking

excessive
struggles

these
never-ending
labors

I
say
that
according
to
all
probability
I
*NL*
shall
not
be
able
to
undergo
the
fatigues
of
the
siege
of
La
Rochelle
,
*NL*
and
that
it
would
be
far
better
that
you
should
appoint
there
either
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Conde
,
Monsieur
de
Bassopierre

or
some
valiant
gentleman
*NL*

business
is
war

not
me

am
a
churchman

am
*NL*
constantly
turned
aside
for
my
real
vocation

look

matters

which
I

no
aptitude

You
would
be
the
happier
for
it
at
home

do
not

you
would
be
the
greater
for
it
abroad

*NL*
``
Monsieur

said
the
king
,
``
I
understand
you

Be
satisfied

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall

Monsieur

we
shall
see

''
said
the
king
,
who
,
in
*NL*
his
joy
at
finding
the
queen
guilty
of
a
crime
which
he
cared
little
*NL*
about
,
and
innocent
of
a
fault
of
which
he
had
great
dread
,
was
ready
to
*NL*
make
up
all
differences
with
her
,
``
we
shall
see
,
but
upon
my
honor
,
you
*NL*
are
too
indulgent
toward

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
leave
severity

Clemency

virtue

employ
it

that
you
derive
*NL*
advantage
therein

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
the
cardinal
,
hearing
the
clock
strike
eleven
,
bowed
low
,
*NL*
asking
permission
of
the
king
to
retire
,
and
supplicating
him
to
come
to
*NL*
a
good
understanding
with
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
the
seizure
of
her
letter
,
*NL*
expected
reproaches
,
was
much
astonished
the
next
day
to
see
the
king
*NL*
make
some
attempts
at
reconciliation
with
her
.
Her
first
movement
was
*NL*
repellent
.
Her
womanly
pride
and
her
queenly
dignity
had
both
been
so
*NL*
cruelly
offended
that
she
could
not
come
round
at
the
first
advance
;
*NL*
but
,
overpersuaded
by
the
advice
of
her
women
,
she
at
last
had
the
*NL*
appearance
of
beginning
to
forget
.
The
king
took
advantage
of
this
*NL*
favorable
moment
to
tell
her
that
he
had
the
intention
of
shortly
giving
*NL*
a
fete
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fete
was
so
rare
a
thing
for
poor
Anne
of
Austria
that
at
this
*NL*
announcement
,
as
the
cardinal
had
predicted
,
the
last
trace
of
her
*NL*
resentment
disappeared
,
if
not
from
her
heart
,
at
least
from
her
*NL*
countenance
.
She
asked
upon
what
day
this
fete
would
take
place
,
but
the
*NL*
king
replied
that
he
must
consult
the
cardinal
upon
that
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
every
day
the
king
asked
the
cardinal
when
this
fete
should
take
*NL*
place
;
and
every
day
the
cardinal
,
under
some
pretext
,
deferred
fixing
*NL*
it
.
Ten
days
passed
away
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eighth
day
after
the
scene
we
have
described
,
the
cardinal
*NL*
received
a
letter
with
the
London
stamp
which
only
contained
these
*NL*
lines
:
``
I
have
them
;
but
I
am
unable
to
leave
London
for
want
of
money
.
*NL*
Send
me
five
hundred
pistoles
,
and
four
or
five
days
after
I
have
*NL*
received
them
I
shall
be
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
same
day
the
cardinal
received
this
letter
the
king
put
his
*NL*
customary
question
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
counted
on
his
fingers
,
and
said
to
himself
,
``
She
will
arrive
,
*NL*
she
says
,
four
or
five
days
after
having
received
the
money
.
It
will
*NL*
require
four
or
five
days
for
the
transmission
of
the
money
,
four
or
*NL*
five
days
for
her
to
return
;
that
makes
ten
days
.
Now
,
allowing
for
*NL*
contrary
winds
,
accidents
,
and
a
woman
's
weakness
,
there
are
twelve
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Monsieur
Duke
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
have
you
made
your
calculations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
.
Today
is
the
twentieth
of
September
.
The
aldermen
of
the
*NL*
city
give
a
fete
on
the
third
of
October
.
That
will
fall
in
wonderfully
*NL*
well
;
you
will
not
appear
to
have
gone
out
of
your
way
to
please
the
*NL*
queen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
cardinal
added
,
``
A
PROPOS
,
sire
,
do
not
forget
to
tell
her
*NL*
Majesty
the
evening
before
the
fete
that
you
should
like
to
see
how
her
*NL*
diamond
studs
become
her

BONACIEUX
AT
HOME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
second
time
the
cardinal
had
mentioned
these
diamond
studs
to
*NL*
the
king
.
Louis
XIII
was
struck
with
this
insistence
,
and
began
to
fancy
*NL*
that
this
recommendation
concealed
some
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
once
the
king
had
been
humiliated
by
the
cardinal
,
whose
*NL*
police
,
without
having
yet
attained
the
perfection
of
the
modern
police
,
*NL*
were
excellent
,
being
better
informed
than
himself
,
even
upon
what
was
*NL*
going
on
in
his
own
household
.
He
hoped
,
then
,
in
a
conversation
with
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
,
to
obtain
some
information
from
that
conversation
,
and
*NL*
afterward
to
come
upon
his
Eminence
with
some
secret
which
the
cardinal
*NL*
either
knew
or
did
not
know
,
but
which
,
in
either
case
,
would
raise
him
*NL*
infinitely
in
the
eyes
of
his
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
then
to
the
queen
,
and
according
to
custom
accosted
her
with
*NL*
fresh
menaces
against
those
who
surrounded
her
.
Anne
of
Austria
lowered
*NL*
her
head
,
allowed
the
torrent
to
flow
on
without
replying
,
hoping
that
*NL*
it
would
cease
of
itself
;
but
this
was
not
what
Louis
XIII
meant
.
Louis
*NL*
XIII
wanted
a
discussion
from
which
some
light
or
other
might
break
,
*NL*
convinced
as
he
was
that
the
cardinal
had
some
afterthought
and
was
*NL*
preparing
for
him
one
of
those
terrible
surprises
which
his
Eminence
was
*NL*
so
skillful
in
getting
up
.
He
arrived
at
this
end
by
his
persistence
in
*NL*
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
Anne
of
Austria
,
tired
of
these
vague
attacks
,
``
but
,
sire
,
*NL*
you
do
not
tell
me
all
that
you
have
in
your
heart
.
What
have
I
done
,
*NL*
then
?
Let
me
know
what
crime
I
have
committed
.
It
is
impossible
that
*NL*
your
Majesty
can
make
all
this
ado
about
a
letter
written
to
my
*NL*
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
,
attacked
in
a
manner
so
direct
,
did
not
know
what
to
answer
;
*NL*
and
he
thought
that
this
was
the
moment
for
expressing
the
desire
which
*NL*
he
was
not
going
to
have
made
until
the
evening
before
the
fete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
he
,
with
dignity
,
``
there
will
shortly
be
a
ball
at
the
*NL*
Hotel
de
Ville
.
I
wish
,
in
order
to
honor
our
worthy
aldermen
,
you
*NL*
should
appear
in
ceremonial
costume
,
and
above
all
,
ornamented
with
the
*NL*
diamond
studs
which
I
gave
you
on
your
birthday
.
That
is
my
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
terrible
.
Anne
of
Austria
believed
that
Louis
XIII
knew
*NL*
all
,
and
that
the
cardinal
had
persuaded
him
to
employ
this
long
*NL*
dissimulation
of
seven
or
eight
days
,
which
,
likewise
,
was
*NL*
characteristic
.
She
became
excessively
pale
,
leaned
her
beautiful
hand
*NL*
upon
a
CONSOLE
,
which
hand
appeared
then
like
one
of
wax
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
the
king
with
terror
in
her
eyes
,
she
was
unable
to
reply
by
a
single
*NL*
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
,
madame
,
''
said
the
king
,
who
enjoyed
the
embarrassment
to
its
*NL*
full
extent
,
but
without
guessing
the
cause
.
``
You
hear
,
madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
,
I
hear
,
''
stammered
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
appear
at
this
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
those
studs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
's
paleness
,
if
possible
,
increased
;
the
king
perceived
it
,
and
*NL*
enjoyed
it
with
that
cold
cruelty
which
was
one
of
the
worst
sides
of
*NL*
his
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
is
agreed
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
and
that
is
all
I
had
to
say
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
on
what
day
will
this
ball
take
place
?
''
asked
Anne
of
Austria
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XIII
felt
instinctively
that
he
ought
not
to
reply
to
this
*NL*
question
,
the
queen
having
put
it
in
an
almost
dying
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
shortly
,
madame
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
I
do
not
precisely
recollect
*NL*
the
date
of
the
day
.
I
will
ask
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
cardinal
,
then
,
who
informed
you
of
this
fete
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
astonished
king
;
``
but
why
do
you
ask
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
he
who
told
you
to
invite
me
to
appear
with
these
studs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
madame
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
he
,
sire
,
it
was
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
does
it
signify
whether
it
was
he
or
I
?
Is
there
any
*NL*
crime
in
this
request
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
will
appear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
,
''
said
the
king
,
retiring
,
``
that
is
well
;
I
count
upon
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
made
a
curtsy
,
less
from
etiquette
than
because
her
knees
were
*NL*
sinking
under
her
.
The
king
went
away
enchanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lost
,
''
murmured
the
queen
,
``
lost
!
--
for
the
cardinal
knows
all
,
and
*NL*
it
is
he
who
urges
on
the
king
,
who
as
yet
knows
nothing
but
will
soon
*NL*
know
everything
.
I
am
lost
!
My
God
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knelt
upon
a
cushion
and
prayed
,
with
her
head
buried
between
her
*NL*
palpitating
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
her
position
was
terrible
.
Buckingham
had
returned
to
London
;
*NL*
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
was
at
Tours
.
More
closely
watched
than
ever
,
the
*NL*
queen
felt
certain
,
without
knowing
how
to
tell
which
,
that
one
of
her
*NL*
women
had
betrayed
her
.
Laporte
could
not
leave
the
Louvre
;
she
had
not
*NL*
a
soul
in
the
world
in
whom
she
could
confide
.
Thus
,
while
contemplating
*NL*
the
misfortune
which
threatened
her
and
the
abandonment
in
which
she
was
*NL*
left
,
she
broke
out
into
sobs
and
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
be
of
service
to
your
Majesty
?
''
said
all
at
once
a
voice
full
of
*NL*
sweetness
and
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
turned
sharply
round
,
for
there
could
be
no
deception
in
the
*NL*
expression
of
that
voice
;
it
was
a
friend
who
spoke
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
at
one
of
the
doors
which
opened
into
the
queen
's
apartment
*NL*
appeared
the
pretty
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
She
had
been
engaged
in
arranging
*NL*
the
dresses
and
linen
in
a
closet
when
the
king
entered
;
she
could
not
*NL*
get
out
and
had
heard
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
uttered
a
piercing
cry
at
finding
herself
surprised
--
for
in
*NL*
her
trouble
she
did
not
at
first
recognize
the
young
woman
who
had
been
*NL*
given
to
her
by
Laporte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
fear
nothing
,
madame
!
''
said
the
young
woman
,
clasping
her
hands
and
*NL*
weeping
herself
at
the
queen
's
sorrows
;
``
I
am
your
Majesty
's
,
body
and
*NL*
soul
,
and
however
far
I
may
be
from
you
,
however
inferior
may
be
my
*NL*
position
,
I
believe
I
have
discovered
a
means
of
extricating
your
*NL*
Majesty
from
your
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
oh
,
heaven
,
you
!
''
cried
the
queen
;
``
but
look
me
in
the
face
.
I
am
*NL*
betrayed
on
all
sides
.
Can
I
trust
in
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
madame
!
''
cried
the
young
woman
,
falling
on
her
knees
;
``
upon
my
*NL*
soul
,
I
am
ready
to
die
for
your
Majesty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
expression
sprang
from
the
very
bottom
of
the
heart
,
and
,
like
the
*NL*
first
,
there
was
no
mistaking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
continued
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
yes
,
there
are
traitors
here
;
but
by
*NL*
the
holy
name
of
the
Virgin
,
I
swear
that
no
one
is
more
devoted
to
your
*NL*
Majesty
than
I
am
.
Those
studs
which
the
king
speaks
of
,
you
gave
them
*NL*
to
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
did
you
not
?
Those
studs
were
enclosed
in
a
*NL*
little
rosewood
box
which
he
held
under
his
arm
?
Am
I
deceived
?
Is
it
*NL*
not
so
,
madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
murmured
the
queen
,
whose
teeth
chattered
with
*NL*
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
those
studs
,
''
continued
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
we
must
have
them
back
*NL*
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
without
doubt
,
it
is
necessary

cried
the
queen
;
``
but
how
am
I
to
*NL*
act
?
How
can
it
be
effected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
must
be
sent
to
the
duke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
,
who
?
In
whom
can
I
trust

*NL*
*NL*
``
Place
confidence
in
me

madame

do
me
that
honor
,
my
queen
,
and
I
will
*NL*
find
a
messenger

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
write

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

that
is
indispensable

Two
words

hand

*NL*
*NL*
``

bring
about

divorce

at

the

been
at

*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
took
the
two
hands
of
the
young
woman
with
a
burst
of
emotion
,
*NL*
gazed
at
her
as
if
to
read
her
very
heart

and
,
seeing
nothing

sincerity
in

beautiful
eyes

embraced

tenderly

*NL*

The
queen
ran
to
a
little
table
,
on
which
were
ink
,
paper
,
and
pens
.
She
*NL*
wrote
two
lines

sealed
the

that
what
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
some

avaricious

Nevertheless

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

''
said
the
queen
.
Those
who
have
read
the
*NL*
MEMOIRS
of
Mme.
de
Motteville
will
not
be
astonished
at
this
reply
.
``
But

a
minute

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
of
Austria
ran
to
her
jewel
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
she
,
``
here
is
a
ring
of
great
value

as
I
have
been

It
came
from

the
King
of
Spain
.
It
is
mine
,
and
I
*NL*
am
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
it
.
Take
this
ring
;
raise
money
with
it

and
*NL*
let
your

set
out

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
hour
you
shall
be
obeyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
the
address
,
''
said
the
queen
,
speaking
so
low
that
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
could
hardly
hear
what
she
said
,
``
To
my
Lord
Duke
of
*NL*
Buckingham
,
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
shall
be
given
to
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Generous
girl
!
''
cried
Anne
of
Austria
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
kissed
the
hands
of
the
queen
,
concealed
the
paper
in
the
*NL*
bosom
of
her
dress
,
and
disappeared
with
the
lightness
of
a
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
minutes
afterward
she
was
at
home
.
As
she
told
the
queen
,
she
had
*NL*
not
seen
her
husband
since
his
liberation
;
she
was
ignorant
of
the
*NL*
change
that
had
taken
place
in
him
with
respect
to
the
cardinal
--
a
*NL*
change
which
had
since
been
strengthened
by
two
or
three
visits
from
the
*NL*
Comte
de
Rochefort
,
who
had
become
the
best
friend
of
Bonacieux
,
and
had
*NL*
persuaded
him
,
without
much
trouble
,
that
no
culpable
sentiments
had
*NL*
prompted
the
abduction
of
his
wife
,
but
that
it
was
only
a
political
*NL*
precaution
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
M.
Bonacieux
alone
;
the
poor
man
was
recovering
with
*NL*
difficulty
the
order
in
his
house
,
in
which
he
had
found
most
of
the
*NL*
furniture
broken
and
the
closets
nearly
emptied
--
justice
not
being
one
*NL*
of
the
three
things
which
King
Solomon
names
as
leaving
no
traces
of
*NL*
their
passage
.
As
to
the
servant
,
she
had
run
away
at
the
moment
of
her
*NL*
master
's
arrest
.
Terror
had
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
poor
girl
that
*NL*
she
had
never
ceased
walking
from
Paris
till
she
reached
Burgundy
,
her
*NL*
native
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
worthy
mercer
had
,
immediately
upon
re-entering
his
house
,
informed
*NL*
his
wife
of
his
happy
return
,
and
his
wife
had
replied
by
congratulating
*NL*
him
,
and
telling
him
that
the
first
moment
she
could
steal
from
her
*NL*
duties
should
be
devoted
to
paying
him
a
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
moment
had
been
delayed
five
days
,
which
,
under
any
other
*NL*
circumstances
,
might
have
appeared
rather
long
to
M.
Bonacieux
;
but
he
*NL*
had
,
in
the
visit
he
had
made
to
the
cardinal
and
in
the
visits
*NL*
Rochefort
had
made
him
,
ample
subjects
for
reflection
,
and
as
everybody
*NL*
knows
,
nothing
makes
time
pass
more
quickly
than
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
more
so
because
Bonacieux
's
reflections
were
all
*NL*
rose-colored
.
Rochefort
called
him
his
friend
,
his
dear
Bonacieux
,
and
*NL*
never
ceased
telling
him
that
the
cardinal
had
a
great
respect
for
him
.
*NL*
The
mercer
fancied
himself
already
on
the
high
road
to
honors
and
*NL*
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
side
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
also
reflected
;
but
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
*NL*
upon
something
widely
different
from
ambition
.
In
spite
of
herself
her
*NL*
thoughts
constantly
reverted
to
that
handsome
young
man
who
was
so
brave
*NL*
and
appeared
to
be
so
much
in
love
.
Married
at
eighteen
to
M.
Bonacieux
,
*NL*
having
always
lived
among
her
husband
's
friends
--
people
little
capable
*NL*
of
inspiring
any
sentiment
whatever
in
a
young
woman
whose
heart
was
*NL*
above
her
position
--
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
remained
insensible
to
vulgar
*NL*
seductions
;
but
at
this
period
the
title
of
gentleman
had
great
*NL*
influence
with
the
citizen
class
,
and
d'Artagnan
was
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
Besides
,
he
wore
the
uniform
of
the
Guards
,
which
,
next
to
that
of
the
*NL*
Musketeers
,
was
most
admired
by
the
ladies
.
He
was
,
we
repeat
,
handsome
,
*NL*
young
,
and
bold
;
he
spoke
of
love
like
a
man
who
did
love
and
was
*NL*
anxious
to
be
loved
in
return
.
There
was
certainly
enough
in
all
this
to
*NL*
turn
a
head
only
twenty-three
years
old
,
and
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
just
*NL*
attained
that
happy
period
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
couple
,
then
,
although
they
had
not
seen
each
other
for
eight
days
,
*NL*
and
during
that
time
serious
events
had
taken
place
in
which
both
were
*NL*
concerned
,
accosted
each
other
with
a
degree
of
preoccupation
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Bonacieux
manifested
real
joy
,
and
advanced
toward
his
*NL*
wife
with
open
arms
.
Madame
Bonacieux
presented
her
cheek
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
talk
a
little
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
''
said
Bonacieux
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
something
of
the
highest
importance
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
have
some
questions
sufficiently
serious
to
put
*NL*
to
you

Describe
to
me
your
abduction
,
I
pray
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
of
no
consequence
just
now
,
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
it
concern
,
then
--
my
captivity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
of
it
the
day
it
happened
;
but
as
you
were
not
guilty
of
any
*NL*
crime

as
you
were
not
guilty
of
any
intrigue
,
as
you
,
in
short
,
knew
*NL*
nothing
that
could
compromise
yourself
or
anybody
else
,
I
attached
no
*NL*
more
importance
to
that
event
than
it
merited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
very
much
at
your
ease
,
madame
,
''
said
Bonacieux
,
hurt
at
the
*NL*
little
interest
his
wife
showed
in
him
.
``
Do
you
know
that
I
was
plunged
*NL*
during
a
day
and
night
in
a
dungeon
of
the
Bastille
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
day
and
night
soon
pass
away
.
Let
us
return
to
the
object
that
*NL*
brings
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
that
which
brings
you
home
to
me

Is
it
not
the
desire
of
seeing

a

again
from
whom
you
have
been
separated
for
a
week
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
mercer
,
piqued
to
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
first
,
and
other
things
afterward

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

*NL*
*NL*

It

a

of
the
highest
interest

upon

our
future
*NL*
fortune
perhaps
depends

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
complexion

changed

much

should
not

*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
knew
that
in
talking
of
money
to
her

she
took
*NL*
him
on
his
weak
side

But

*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
was
repeating

for

a
sentence

had
heard

from

Comte

the
poor

reckoned
on

in

at

Nevertheless

Bonacieux

Monsieur

said
the

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame

said
Bonacieux

who
had
never
seen
his

recoiled
before
this
conjugal
anger

``
madame

*NL*
*NL*

I

you

continued
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
who
saw
*NL*
she
was
regaining
some
little
influence
over
her
husband
.
``
You
meddle
*NL*
with
politics

do
you

still
more

with

politics

Why

you
sell
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

the

I
have
told

You

accomplish
loyally
the

I
deign
to

on

condition
I

I

what

more

and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
,
``
I
restore
my

*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
was
cowardly
and
avaricious
,
but
he
loved
his
wife
.
He
was
*NL*
softened
.
A
man
of
fifty
can
not
long
bear
malice
with
a
wife
of
*NL*
twenty-three
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
saw
that
he
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Have
you
decided
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
love
,
reflect
a
little
upon
what
you
require
of
me
.
London
*NL*
is
far
from
Paris
,
very
far
,
and
perhaps
the
commission
with
which
you
*NL*
charge
me
is
not
without
dangers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
matters
it
,
if
you
avoid
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
Madame
Bonacieux

''
said
the
mercer
,
``
hold
!
I
positively
refuse
;
*NL*
intrigues
terrify
me

I
have
seen
the
Bastille

My

Whew
!
That
's
a
*NL*
frightful
place
,
that
Bastille
!
Only
to
think
of
it
makes
my
flesh
*NL*
crawl
.
They
threatened
me
with
torture
.
Do
you
know
what
torture
is
?
*NL*
Wooden
points
that
they
stick
in
between
your
legs

your
bones
stick
*NL*
out

No
,
positively
I
will
not
go

And
,
MORBLEU
,
why
do
you
not
go
*NL*
yourself
?
For
in
truth
,
I
think
I
have
hitherto
been
deceived
in
you

I
*NL*
really
believe
you
are
a
man

a
violent
one

too

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you

you
are
a

a
miserable

stupid

brutal

You
are

afraid

are
you

Well
,
if
you
do
not
go
this
very
instant
,
I
will
have
*NL*
you
arrested
by
the
queen
's
orders
,
and
I
will
have
you
placed
in
the
*NL*
Bastille
which
you
dread
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
fell
into
a
profound
reflection
.
He
weighed
the
two
angers
in
*NL*
his
brain
--
that
of
the
cardinal
and
that
of
the
queen
;
that
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
predominated
enormously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
me
arrested
on
the
part
of
the
queen
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
--
I
will
*NL*
appeal
to
his
Eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
Mme.
Bonacieux
saw
that
she
had
gone
too
far
,
and
she
was
*NL*
terrified
at
having
communicated
so
much
.
She
for
a
moment
contemplated
*NL*
with
fright
that
stupid
countenance
,
impressed
with
the
invincible
*NL*
resolution
of
a
fool
that
is
overcome
by
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
it
so
!
''
said
she
.
``
Perhaps
,
when
all
is
considered
,
you
are
*NL*
right
.
In
the
long
run
,
a
man
knows
more
about
politics
than
a
woman
,
*NL*
particularly
such
as
,
like
you
,
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
have
conversed
with
*NL*
the
cardinal
.
And
yet
it
is
very
hard
,
''
added
she
,
``
that
a
man
upon
*NL*
whose
affection
I
thought
I
might
depend
,
treats
me
thus
unkindly
and
*NL*
will
not
comply
with
any
of
my
fancies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
because
your
fancies
go
too
far
,
''
replied
the
triumphant
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
``
and
I
mistrust
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
give
it
up
,
then
,
''
said
the
young
woman
,
sighing
.
``
It
is
*NL*
well
as
it
is
;
say
no
more
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
you
should
tell
me
what
I
should
have
to
do
in
London
,
''
*NL*
replied
Bonacieux
,
who
remembered
a
little
too
late
that
Rochefort
had
*NL*
desired
him
to
endeavor
to
obtain
his
wife
's
secrets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
use
for
you
to
know
anything
about
it
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
woman
,
whom
an
instinctive
mistrust
now
impelled
to
draw
back
.
``
It
was
*NL*
about
one
of
those
purchases
that
interest
women
--
a
purchase
by
which
*NL*
much
might
have
been
gained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
more
the
young
woman
excused
herself
,
the
more
important
*NL*
Bonacieux
thought
the
secret
which
she
declined
to
confide
to
him
.
He
*NL*
resolved
then
to
hasten
immediately
to
the
residence
of
the
Comte
de
*NL*
Rochefort
,
and
tell
him
that
the
queen
was
seeking
for
a
messenger
to
*NL*
send
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
for
quitting
you
,
my
dear
Madame
Bonacieux
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
,
*NL*
not
knowing
you
would
come
to
see
me
,
I
had
made
an
engagement
with

friend

I
shall
soon
return

if
you
will
wait
only
a
few
minutes
for
*NL*
me
,
as
soon
as
I
have
concluded
my
business
with
that
friend

it
is
*NL*
growing
late

I
will
come
back

reconduct
you
to
the
Louvre

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

not
brave
enough

replied
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
``
I
shall
return
very
safely

the
*NL*
Louvre
all
alone

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
ex-mercer

I

again
soon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
week
I
hope
my

me
a
little
liberty

take
advantage

come

*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
kissed
his
wife
's
hand
,
and
set
off
at
a
quick
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
when
her
husband
had
shut
the
street
door
*NL*
and
she
found
herself
alone
;
``
that
imbecile
lacked
but
one
thing
:
to
*NL*
become
a
cardinalist
.
And
I
,
who
have
answered
for
him
to
the
queen
--
I
,
*NL*
who
have
promised
my
poor
mistress
--
ah
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
She
will
take
me
*NL*
for
one
of
those
wretches
with
whom
the
palace
swarms
and
who
are
placed
*NL*
about
her
as
spies

Ah

Monsieur
Bonacieux

I
never
did
love
you
much

now
it
is
worse
than

I
hate
you

my
word
you
shall
pay

for
this
!

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
she
spoke
these
words
a
rap
on
the
ceiling
made
her
raise
*NL*
her
head
,
and
a
voice
which
reached
her
through
the
ceiling
cried
,
``

*NL*
Ah

Madame

said
d'Artagnan
,
entering
by
the
door
which
the
young
woman
*NL*
opened
for
him
,
``

with
disquiet

*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*
``
By

animated

*NL*
``
And

chagrin

*NL*
*NL*

Mme.

looked
at
the
young

restrained
for
a
minute
by
a
*NL*
last
hesitation

there
was
such
an
ardor
in
his
eyes

such
*NL*
persuasion
in
his
voice
,
that
she
felt
herself
constrained
to
confide
in
*NL*
him

Besides
,
she
found
herself
in
circumstances
where
everything
must
*NL*
be
risked
for
the
sake
of
everything

The
queen
might
be
as
much
injured
*NL*
by
too
much
reticence
as
by
too
much
confidence
;
and
--
let
us
admit
*NL*
it
--
the
involuntary
sentiment
which
she
felt
for
her
young
protector
*NL*
decided
her
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

''
said
she
;

yield

Then
the

confided
in

the

to
him
a
part
in
front
of
the
Samaritaine
.
This
*NL*
was
their
mutual
declaration
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
radiant
with
joy
and
pride
.
This
secret
which
he
*NL*
possessed
,
this
woman
whom
he
loved
!
Confidence
and
love
made
him
a
*NL*
giant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
go
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
you
will
go
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
and
your
regiment
,
your
*NL*
captain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
my
soul
,
you
had
made
me
forget
all
that
,
dear
Constance
!
Yes
,
you
*NL*
are
right
;
a
furlough
is
needful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
another
obstacle
,
''
murmured
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
that
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
after
a
moment
of
reflection
,
``
I
shall
*NL*
surmount
it
,
be
assured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
this
very
evening
to
Treville
,
whom
I
will
request
to
ask
*NL*
this
favor
for
me
of
his
brother-in-law
,
Monsieur
Dessessart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
another
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
,
seeing
that
Mme.
Bonacieux
hesitated
to
*NL*
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
perhaps
,
no
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
PERHAPS
is
too
much
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
replied
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
opening
a
cupboard
and
taking
from
it
*NL*
the
very
bag
which
a
half
hour
before
her
husband
had
caressed
so
*NL*
affectionately
,
``
take
this
bag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cardinal
's
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
breaking
into
a
loud
laugh
,
he
*NL*
having
heard
,
as
may
be
remembered
,
thanks
to
the
broken
boards
,
every
*NL*
syllable
of
the
conversation
between
the
mercer
and
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cardinal

replied
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
``
You
see
it
makes
a
very
*NL*
respectable
appearance

*NL*
*NL*
``
PARDIEU

cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
will
be
a
double
amusing
affair
to
save
*NL*
the
queen
with
the
cardinal

money

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
amiable

said
Mme.
Bonacieux
.

Be

*NL*
*NL*

Oh

I
am
already
grandly
recompensed

cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
love
you

*NL*
you
permit
me
to
tell
you
that
I

that

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
starting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
is
talking
in

It

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
ran
to
the
door
and
pushed
the
bolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
not
come
in

he
;

*NL*
*NL*

You

``
Ah

said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
you
speak
that
in
a
tone
that
frightens
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
pronounced
these
words
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
saw
those
tears
,
and
much
disturbed
,
softened
,
he
threw
himself
at
her
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
you
will
be
as
safe

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

said
she
,
``
I
place
full
confidence

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
drew
back
the
bolt
with
precaution
,
and
both
,
light
as
*NL*
shadows
,
glided
through
the
interior
door
into
the
passage
,
ascended
the
*NL*
stairs
as
quietly
as
possible
,
and
entered
d'Artagnan
's
chambers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
there
,
for
greater
security
,
the
young
man
barricaded
the
door
.
*NL*
They
both
approached
the
window
,
and
through
a
slit
in
the
shutter
they
*NL*
saw
Bonacieux
talking
with
a
man
in
a
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
sight
of
this
man
,
d'Artagnan
started
,
and
half
drawing
his
sword
,
*NL*
sprang
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
man
of
Meung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
you
will
ruin

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have

d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

devoted

In

I
forbid

foreign

And

speaking

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
drew
near
the
window
,
and
lent
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Bonacieux
had
opened
his
door
,
and
seeing
the
apartment
,
had
returned
*NL*
to
the
man
in
the
cloak
,
whom
he
had
left
alone
for
an
instant

*NL*
*NL*

She

*NL*
``
You
are
sure

replied
the
stranger

that

did
not
suspect
the
*NL*
intentions

which
you
went
out

*NL*
*NL*

No

replied
Bonacieux
,
with
a
self-sufficient
air
,

she

superficial
a
woman

*NL*

Is

All

ask

*NL*
Bonacieux
re-entered
the
house
,
passed
through
the
same
door
that
had
*NL*
afforded
a
passage
for
the
two
fugitives
,
went
up
to
d'Artagnan
's
door
,
*NL*
and
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
answered

Porthos
,
in
order
to
make
a
greater
display
,
had
that
*NL*
evening
borrowed
Planchet
.
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
he
took
care
not
to
give
*NL*
the
least
sign
of
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
hand
of
Bonacieux
sounded
on
the
door
,
the
two
young
*NL*
people
felt
their
hearts
bound
within
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nobody
within

Bonacieux

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
raised
the
three
or
four
boards
which
made
his
chamber
*NL*
another
ear
of
Dionysius
,
spread
a
carpet
on
the
floor
,
went
upon
his
*NL*
knees
,
and
made
a
sign
to
Mme.
Bonacieux
to
stoop
as
he
did
toward
the
*NL*
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

she
abandoned

the

The
stranger
went
out

*NL*
``
Silence

said
d'Artagnan

pressing

still

warmly

A
terrible
howling
interrupted
these
reflections
of
d'Artagnan
and
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
.
It
was
her
husband
,
who
had
discovered
the
disappearance
of
*NL*
the
moneybag
,
and
was
crying
``
Thieves
!

*NL*
``
Oh

Mme.

*NL*
Bonacieux
called
a
long
time
;
but
as
such
cries
,
on
account
of
their
*NL*
frequency
,
brought
nobody
in
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
,
and
as
lately
the
*NL*
mercer
's
house
had
a
bad
name
,
finding
that
nobody
came
,
he
went
out
*NL*
continuing
to
call
,
his
voice
being
heard
fainter
and
fainter
as
he
went
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
Rue
du
Bac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
he
is
gone

said
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
``
Courage

prudence

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
only
replied
by
the
beautiful
glow
which
mounted
to
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
A
few
seconds
afterward
d'Artagnan
also
went
out
enveloped
in
a
*NL*
large
cloak
,
which
ill-concealed
the
sheath
of
a
long
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
followed
him
with
her
eyes

with
that
long

fond
look

with
which
he
had
turned
the
angle
of

street

fell
on

knees

clasping
her
hands

``

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
went
straight
to
M.
de
Treville
's
.
He
had
reflected
that
in
a
*NL*
few
minutes
the
cardinal
would
be
warned
by
this
cursed
stranger
,
who
*NL*
appeared
to
be
his
agent
,
and
he
judged
,
with
reason
,
he
had
not
a
*NL*
moment
to
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heart
of
the
young
man
overflowed
with
joy
.
An
opportunity
presented
*NL*
itself
to
him
in
which
there
would
be
at
the
same
time
glory
to
be
*NL*
acquired
,
and
money
to
be
gained
;
and
as
a
far
higher
encouragement
,
it
*NL*
brought
him
into
close
intimacy
with
a
woman
he
adored
.
This
chance
did
,
*NL*
then
,
for
him
at
once
more
than
he
would
have
dared
to
ask
of
*NL*
Providence
.

M

Treville
was
in
his
saloon
with
his
habitual
court
of
gentlemen
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
was
known
as
a
familiar
of
the
house
,
went
straight
to
*NL*
his
office
,
and
sent
word
that
he
wished
to
see
him
on
something
of
*NL*
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
been
there
scarcely
five
minutes
when
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
entered
.
At
the
first
glance
,
and
by
the
joy
which
was
painted
on
his
*NL*
countenance
,
the
worthy
captain
plainly
perceived
that
something
new
was
*NL*
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
along
d'Artagnan
had
been
consulting
with
himself
whether
he
*NL*
should
place
confidence
in
M.
de
Treville
,
or
whether
he
should
only
ask
*NL*
him
to
give
him
CARTE
BLANCHE
for
some
secret
affair
.
But
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
had
always
been
so
thoroughly
his
friend
,
had
always
been
so
devoted
to
*NL*
the
king
and
queen
,
and
hated
the
cardinal
so
cordially
,
that
the
young
*NL*
man
resolved
to
tell
him
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ask
for
me
,
my
good
friend
?
''
said
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
lowering
his
voice
,
``
and
you
will
*NL*
pardon
me
,
I
hope
,
for
having
disturbed
you
when
you
know
the
importance
*NL*
of
my
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
then
,
I
am
all
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
concerns
nothing
less
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
than
the
honor
,
perhaps
*NL*
the
life
of
the
queen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
asked
M.
de
Treville
,
glancing
round
to
see
if
they
*NL*
were
surely
alone
,
and
then
fixing
his
questioning
look
upon
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
monsieur
,
that
chance
has
rendered
me
master
of
a
secret
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
you
will
guard
,
I
hope
,
young
man
,
as
your
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
which
I
must
impart
to
you
,
monsieur
,
for
you
alone
can
assist
me
*NL*
in
the
mission
I
have
just
received
from
her
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
secret
your
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

monsieur
;
it
is
her
Majesty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
authorized
by
her
Majesty
to
communicate
it
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

on
the
contrary

I
am
desired
to
preserve
the
*NL*
profoundest
mystery

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
are
you
about
to
betray
it
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because

I
said

without
you
I
can
do
nothing

I
am
afraid
you

will
refuse
me
the
favor
I
come
to
ask

not

what
end
I
*NL*
ask
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
secret

man

tell
me
what
you
wish

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

d'Artagnan

*NL*
``
Believe

continued
Treville

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*

But
*NL*
first
write
your

Perhaps
you
had
a
spy
at
your

heels
;
and
your
visit

if
it

ever
be
known
to
the

will
*NL*
thus
seem
legitimate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
drew
up
his
request
,
and
M.
de
Treville
,
on
receiving
it
,
*NL*
assured
him
that
by
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
four
leaves
of
*NL*
absence
should
be
at
the
respective
domiciles
of
the
travelers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
the
goodness
to
send
mine
to

I
should
dread

some
disagreeable
encounter

were
to
go
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy

Adieu

a

A
PROPOS
,
''
said
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
,
calling
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
tapped
the
bag
he
had
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
?
''
asked
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
pistoles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
plenty
!
That
would
carry
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
Begone
,
*NL*
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
saluted
M.
de
Treville
,
who
held
out
his
hand
to
him
;
*NL*
d'Artagnan
pressed
it
with
a
respect
mixed
with
gratitude
.
Since
his
*NL*
first
arrival
at
Paris
,
he
had
had
constant
occasion
to
honor
this
*NL*
excellent
man
,
whom
he
had
always
found
worthy
,
loyal
,
and
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
visit
was
to
Aramis
,
at
whose
residence
he
had
not
been
since
*NL*
the
famous
evening
on
which
he
had
followed
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
Still
*NL*
further
,
he
had
seldom
seen
the
young
Musketeer
;
but
every
time
he
had
*NL*
seen
him
,
he
had
remarked
a
deep
sadness
imprinted
on
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
,
especially
,
Aramis
was
melancholy
and
thoughtful
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
asked
some
questions
about
this
prolonged
melancholy
.
Aramis
*NL*
pleaded
as
his
excuse
a
commentary
upon
the
eighteenth
chapter
of
St.
*NL*
Augustine
,
which
he
was
forced
to
write
in
Latin
for
the
following
week
,
*NL*
and
which
preoccupied
him
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
two
friends
had
been
chatting
a
few
moments
,
a
servant
from
M.
*NL*
de
Treville
entered
,
bringing
a
sealed
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
leave
of
absence
Monsieur
has
asked
for
,
''
replied
the
lackey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
!
I
have
asked
for
no
leave
of
absence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
and
take
it
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
And
you
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
there
is
a
demipistole
for
your
trouble
;
you
will
tell
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Treville
that
Monsieur
Aramis
is
very
much
obliged
to
him
.
Go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lackey
bowed
to
the
ground
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
all
this
mean
?
''
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pack
up
all
you
want
for
a
journey
of
a
fortnight
,
and
follow
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
not
leave
Paris
just
now
without
knowing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
become
of
her
?
I
suppose
you
mean
--
''
continued
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Become
of
whom
?
''
replied
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
woman
who
was
here
--
the
woman
with
the
embroidered
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
there
was
a
woman
here
?
''
replied
Aramis
,
becoming
as
pale
*NL*
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
who
she
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
can
guess
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
said
Aramis
.
``
Since
you
appear
to
know
so
many
things
,
can
you
*NL*
tell
me
what
is
become
of
that
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
that
she
has
returned
to
Tours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Tours
?
Yes
,
that
may
be
.
You
evidently
know
her
.
But
why
did
she
*NL*
return
to
Tours
without
telling
me
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
was
in
fear
of
being
arrested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
has
she
not
written
to
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
was
afraid
of
compromising
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
you
restore
me
to
life
!
''
cried
Aramis
.
``
I
fancied
myself
*NL*
despised
,
betrayed
.
I
was
so
delighted
to
see
her
again
!
I
could
not
*NL*
have
believed
she
would
risk
her
liberty
for
me
,
and
yet
for
what
other
*NL*
cause
could
she
have
returned
to
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
cause
which
today
takes
us
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
this
cause
?
''
demanded
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
know
it
someday

Aramis
;
but
at
present
I
must
imitate
the
*NL*
discretion
of
`
the
doctor
's
niece
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
smiled
,
as
he
remembered
the
tale
he
had
told
his
friends
on
a
*NL*
certain
evening
.
``
Well
,
then
,
since
she
has
left
Paris
,
and
you
are
sure
*NL*
of
it
,
d'Artagnan
,
nothing
prevents
me
,
and
I
am
ready
to
follow
you
.
*NL*
You
say
we
are
going
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
Athos
now

and
if
you
will
come
thither

I
beg
you
to
make

for
we
have
lost
much
time
already

A
PROPOS
,
inform
Bazin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Bazin
go
with
us
?
''
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
.
At
all
events
,
it
is
best
that
he
should
follow
us
to
*NL*
Athos
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
called
Bazin
,
and
,
after
having
ordered
him
to
join
them
at
*NL*
Athos
's
residence
,
said
``
Let
us
go
then
,
''
at
the
same
time
taking
his
*NL*
cloak
,
sword
,
and
three
pistols
,
opening
uselessly
two
or
three
drawers
*NL*
to
see
if
he
could
not
find
stray
coin
.
When
well
assured
this
search
*NL*
was
superfluous
,
he
followed
d'Artagnan
,
wondering
to
himself
how
this
*NL*
young
Guardsman
should
know
so
well
who
the
lady
was
to
whom
he
had
*NL*
given
hospitality
,
and
that
he
should
know
better
than
himself
what
had
*NL*
become
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
as
they
went
out
Aramis
placed
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
and
looking
at
him
earnestly
,
``
You
have
not
spoken
of
this
lady
?
''
said
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
nobody
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
to
Athos
or
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
breathed
a
syllable
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tranquil
on
this
important
point
,
Aramis
continued
his
way
with
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
and
both
soon
arrived
at
Athos
's
dwelling
.
They
found
him
*NL*
holding
his
leave
of
absence
in
one
hand
,
and
M.
de
Treville
's
note
in
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
explain
to
me
what
signify
this
leave
of
absence
and
this
*NL*
letter
,
which
I
have
just
received
?
''
said
the
astonished
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
Athos
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
,
as
your
health
absolutely
requires
it
,
that
you
should
rest
for
*NL*
a
fortnight
.
Go
,
then
,
and
take
the
waters
of
Forges
,
or
any
that
may
be
*NL*
more
agreeable
to
you
,
and
recuperate
yourself
as
quickly
as
possible

*NL*
*NL*
Yours
affectionate
,
*NL*
*NL*
de
Treville
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
leave
of
absence

that
letter
mean
that
you
must
follow

me
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
waters

There

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Porthos
entered
.
``

said
he
,
``
here
is
a

Musketeers

leave
*NL*
of
absence

their
asking
for
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
,

said
d'Artagnan

friends

ask
it
for
them

Ah

something
fresh
here

``
Yes

are
going

demanded
Porthos

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith

I
do

about

*NL*
``
To
London
!

Porthos

what
the
devil
are
we
going
to
do
in

*NL*
*NL*

That
is
what

``
But
in

go

*NL*

I

replied
d'Artagnan
,
pulling
out
his
treasure
from
his
pocket
,
*NL*
and
placing
it
on
the
table
.
``
There
are
in
this
bag
three
hundred

Let
each
take
seventy-five

that
is
enough

take
us
to

back

Besides

make
yourselves
easy
;
we
shall
not
all
arrive

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so

*NL*
*NL*

be
left
on

``
Is
this
,
then
,
a
campaign
upon
which
we
are
now
entering
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
a
most
dangerous
kind

I
give
you
notice

*NL*
*NL*

Ah
!
But
if
we

being

Porthos

at

I
should

You
would

*NL*

yet

Aramis

``
I
am
somewhat
of
Porthos

opinion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
king
accustomed

is
fighting
going
on
in
Gascony

no

this

*NL*
*NL*

d'Artagnan

indeed

I

Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
men
traveling
together
would
be
suspected

D'Artagnan
will
give

each
of
us
his
instructions

I
will
go
by
the
way
of
Boulogne

clear

the
way

Athos

set
out
two
hours
after

of

follow
us

of

he
will
go
by
what

route
he
thinks
is
best

in
Planchet
's
clothes

Planchet
will
*NL*
follow
us

in
the
uniform
of
the
Guards

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen

said
Athos
,
``
my
opinion
is
that
it
is
not
proper
to
allow

lackeys
to
have
anything
to
do
in
such
an
affair
.
A
secret
may
,
by

chance

be
betrayed

it
is
almost
always
sold
by

*NL*
*NL*
``
Porthos

to
me
to
be
impracticable

d'Artagnan

I
am
myself
ignorant

travel
in
company

This
letter

here

in

*NL*

he
pointed
to
the
pocket
which
contained
the
letter

``
If

should
be

one
of
you
must
take
it

continue

it
will
be
another

turn

so
on

a
single
one

that
is
all
that
is
required

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

d'Artagnan

your
opinion
is
mine

cried
Athos

Besides

we
*NL*
must
be
consistent

I
am
going

take
the
waters

will
accompany

me

Instead
of
taking
the
waters
of
Forges
,
I
go

take
sea
waters

I
*NL*
am
free

do
so

If
anyone
wishes

I
will
show
Monsieur

if
we
are
tried

stoutly

maintain

only
anxious

dip
ourselves
a
certain
number

the
sea

They
would
have
an
easy
bargain

four
isolated

THE
JOURNEY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
our
four
adventurers
left
Paris
by
the
*NL*
Barriere
St.
Denis
.
As
long
as
it
was
dark
they
remained
silent
;
in
*NL*
spite
of
themselves
they
submitted
to
the
influence
of
the
obscurity
,
*NL*
and
apprehended
ambushes
on
every
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
first
rays
of
day
their
tongues
were
loosened
;
with
the
sun
*NL*
gaiety
revived
.
It
was
like
the
eve
of
a
battle
;
the
heart
beat
,
the
*NL*
eyes
laughed
,
and
they
felt
that
the
life
they
were
perhaps
going
to
*NL*
lose
,
was
,
after
all
,
a
good
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
the
appearance
of
the
caravan
was
formidable
.
The
black
horses
*NL*
of
the
Musketeers
,
their
martial
carriage
,
with
the
regimental
step
of
*NL*
these
noble
companions
of
the
soldier
,
would
have
betrayed
the
most
*NL*
strict
incognito
.
The
lackeys
followed
,
armed
to
the
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
went
well
till
they
arrived
at
Chantilly
,
which
they
reached
about
*NL*
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
They
needed
breakfast
,
and
alighted
at
the
*NL*
door
of
an
AUBERGE
,
recommended
by
a
sign
representing
St.
Martin
giving
*NL*
half
his
cloak
to
a
poor
man
.
They
ordered
the
lackeys
not
to
unsaddle
*NL*
the
horses
,
and
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
set
off
again
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
common
hall
,
and
placed
themselves
at
table
.
A
*NL*
gentleman
,
who
had
just
arrived
by
the
route
of
Dammartin
,
was
seated
at
*NL*
the
same
table
,
and
was
breakfasting
.
He
opened
the
conversation
about
*NL*
rain
and
fine
weather
;
the
travelers
replied
.
He
drank
to
their
good
*NL*
health
,
and
the
travelers
returned
his
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
Mousqueton
came
to
announce
that
the
horses
were
*NL*
ready
,
and
they
were
arising
from
table
,
the
stranger
proposed
to
*NL*
Porthos
to
drink
the
health
of
the
cardinal
.
Porthos
replied
that
he
*NL*
asked
no
better
if
the
stranger
,
in
his
turn
,
would
drink
the
health
of
*NL*
the
king
.
The
stranger
cried
that
he
acknowledged
no
other
king
but
his
*NL*
Eminence
.
Porthos
called
him
drunk
,
and
the
stranger
drew
his
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
committed
a
piece
of
folly
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
but
it
ca
n't
be
*NL*
helped
;
there
is
no
drawing
back
.
Kill
the
fellow
,
and
rejoin
us
as
soon
*NL*
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
remounted
their
horses
,
and
set
out
at
a
good
pace
,
while
*NL*
Porthos
was
promising
his
adversary
to
perforate
him
with
all
the
*NL*
thrusts
known
in
the
fencing
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
goes
one
!
''
cried
Athos
,
at
the
end
of
five
hundred
paces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
that
man
attack
Porthos
rather
than
any
other
one
of
us
?
''
*NL*
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
as
Porthos
was
talking
louder
than
the
rest
of
us
,
he
took
him
*NL*
for
the
chief
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
said
that
this
cadet
from
Gascony
was
a
well
of
wisdom
,
''
*NL*
murmured
Athos
;
and
the
travelers
continued
their
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Beauvais
they
stopped
two
hours
,
as
well
to
breathe
their
horses
a
*NL*
little
as
to
wait
for
Porthos
.
At
the
end
of
two
hours
,
as
Porthos
did
*NL*
not
come
,
not
any
news
of
him
,
they
resumed
their
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
league
from
Beauvais
,
where
the
road
was
confined
between
two
high
*NL*
banks
,
they
fell
in
with
eight
or
ten
men
who
,
taking
advantage
of
the
*NL*
road
being
unpaved
in
this
spot
,
appeared
to
be
employed
in
digging
*NL*
holes
and
filling
up
the
ruts
with
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
not
liking
to
soil
his
boots
with
this
artificial
mortar
,
*NL*
apostrophized
them
rather
sharply
.
Athos
wished
to
restrain
him
,
but
it
*NL*
was
too
late
.
The
laborers
began
to
jeer
the
travelers
and
by
their
*NL*
insolence
disturbed
the
equanimity
even
of
the
cool
Athos
,
who
urged
on
*NL*
his
horse
against
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
each
of
these
men
retreated
as
far
as
the
ditch
,
from
which
each
*NL*
took
a
concealed
musket
;
the
result
was
that
our
seven
travelers
were
*NL*
outnumbered
in
weapons
.
Aramis
received
a
ball
which
passed
through
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
Mousqueton
another
ball
which
lodged
in
the
fleshy
part
*NL*
which
prolongs
the
lower
portion
of
the
loins
.
Therefore
Mousqueton
*NL*
alone
fell
from
his
horse
,
not
because
he
was
severely
wounded
,
but
not
*NL*
being
able
to
see
the
wound
,
he
judged
it
to
be
more
serious
than
it
*NL*
really
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
an
ambuscade
!
''
shouted
d'Artagnan
.
``
Do
n't
waste
a
charge
!
*NL*
Forward
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
wounded
as
he
was
,
seized
the
mane
of
his
horse
,
which
carried
*NL*
him
on
with
the
others
.
Mousqueton
's
horse
rejoined
them
,
and
galloped
*NL*
by
the
side
of
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
serve
us
for
a
relay
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
have
had
a
hat
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Mine
was
carried
away
*NL*
by
a
ball
.
By
my
faith
,
it
is
very
fortunate
that
the
letter

not
in
*NL*
it

They

when
he
comes
up
,
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Porthos
were
on
his
legs
,
he
would
have
rejoined
us
by
this
time
,
''
*NL*
said
Athos
.
``
My
opinion
is
that
on
the
ground
the
drunken
man
was
not
*NL*
intoxicated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
continued
at
their
best
speed
for
two
hours
,
although
the
horses
*NL*
were
so
fatigued
that
it
was
to
be
feared
they
would
soon
refuse
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
travelers
had
chosen
crossroads
in
the
hope
that
they
might
meet
*NL*
with
less
interruption
;
but
at
Crevecoeur
,
Aramis
declared
he
could
*NL*
proceed
no
farther
.
In
fact
,
it
required
all
the
courage
which
he
*NL*
concealed
beneath
his
elegant
form
and
polished
manners
to
bear
him
so
*NL*
far
.
He
grew
more
pale
every
minute
,
and
they
were
obliged
to
support
*NL*
him
on
his
horse
.
They
lifted
him
off
at
the
door
of
a
cabaret
,
left
*NL*
Bazin
with
him
,
who
,
besides
,
in
a
skirmish
was
more
embarrassing
than
*NL*
useful
,
and
set
forward
again
in
the
hope
of
sleeping
at
Amiens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MORBLEU
,
''
said
Athos
,
as
soon
as
they
were
again
in
motion
,
``
reduced
to
*NL*
two
masters
and
Grimaud
and
Planchet
!
MORBLEU
!
I
wo
n't
be
their
dupe
,
I
*NL*
will
answer
for
it
.
I
will
neither
open
my
mouth
nor
draw
my
sword
*NL*
between
this
and
Calais
.
I
swear
by
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
waste
time
in
swearing
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
let
us
gallop
,
if
our
*NL*
horses
will
consent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
travelers
buried
their
rowels
in
their
horses
'
flanks
,
who
thus
*NL*
vigorously
stimulated
recovered
their
energies
.
They
arrived
at
Amiens
*NL*
at
midnight
,
and
alighted
at
the
AUBERGE
of
the
Golden
Lily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
had
the
appearance
of
as
honest
a
man
as
any
on
earth
.
He
*NL*
received
the
travelers
with
his
candlestick
in
one
hand
and
his
cotton
*NL*
nightcap
in
the
other
.
He
wished
to
lodge
the
two
travelers
each
in
a
*NL*
charming
chamber
;
but
unfortunately
these
charming
chambers
were
at
the
*NL*
opposite
extremities
of
the
hotel
.
D'Artagnan
and
Athos
refused
them
.
*NL*
The
host
replied
that
he
had
no
other
worthy
of
their
Excellencies
;
but
*NL*
the
travelers
declared
they
would
sleep
in
the
common
chamber
,
each
on
a
*NL*
mattress
which
might
be
thrown
upon
the
ground
.
The
host
insisted
;
but
*NL*
the
travelers
were
firm
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
do
as
they
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
just
prepared
their
beds
and
barricaded
their
door
within
,
when
*NL*
someone
knocked
at
the
yard
shutter
;
they
demanded
who
was
there
,
and
*NL*
recognizing
the
voices
of
their
lackeys
,
opened
the
shutter
.
It
was
*NL*
indeed
Planchet
and
Grimaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grimaud
can
take
care
of
the
horses
,
''
said
Planchet
.
``
If
you
are
*NL*
willing
,
gentlemen
,
I
will
sleep
across
your
doorway
,
and
you
will
then
*NL*
be
certain
that
nobody
can
reach
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
what
will
you
sleep
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
my
bed
,
''
replied
Planchet
,
producing
a
bundle
of
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
are
right
.
Mine
host
's
face
does
not
*NL*
please
me
at
all
;
it
is
too
gracious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
me
either
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
mounted
by
the
window
and
installed
himself
across
the
doorway
,
*NL*
while
Grimaud
went
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
stable
,
undertaking
that
*NL*
by
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
he
and
the
four
horses
should
be
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
quiet
enough
.
Toward
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
somebody
*NL*
endeavored
to
open
the
door
;
but
as
Planchet
awoke
in
an
instant
and
*NL*
cried
,
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
somebody
replied
that
he
was
mistaken
,
and
went
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
they
heard
a
terrible
riot
in
the
*NL*
stables
.
Grimaud
had
tried
to
waken
the
stable
boys
,
and
the
stable
boys
*NL*
had
beaten
him
.
When
they
opened
the
window
,
they
saw
the
poor
lad
lying
*NL*
senseless
,
with
his
head
split
by
a
blow
with
a
pitchfork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
went
down
into
the
yard
,
and
wished
to
saddle
the
horses
;
but
*NL*
the
horses
were
all
used
up
.
Mousqueton
's
horse
which
had
traveled
for
*NL*
five
or
six
hours
without
a
rider
the
day
before
,
might
have
been
able
*NL*
to
pursue
the
journey
;
but
by
an
inconceivable
error
the
veterinary
*NL*
surgeon
,
who
had
been
sent
for
,
as
it
appeared
,
to
bleed
one
of
the
*NL*
host
's
horses
,
had
bled
Mousqueton
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
began
to
be
annoying
.
All
these
successive
accidents
were
perhaps
*NL*
the
result
of
chance
;
but
they
might
be
the
fruits
of
a
plot
.
Athos
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
went
out
,
while
Planchet
was
sent
to
inquire
if
there
were
*NL*
not
three
horses
for
sale
in
the
neighborhood
.
At
the
door
stood
two
*NL*
horses
,
fresh
,
strong
,
and
fully
equipped
.
These
would
just
have
suited
*NL*
them
.
He
asked
where
their
masters
were
,
and
was
informed
that
they
had
*NL*
passed
the
night
in
the
inn
,
and
were
then
settling
their
bill
with
the
*NL*
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
went
down
to
pay
the
reckoning
,
while
d'Artagnan
and
Planchet
*NL*
stood
at
the
street
door
.
The
host
was
in
a
lower
and
back
room
,
to
*NL*
which
Athos
was
requested
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
entered
without
the
least
mistrust
,
and
took
out
two
pistoles
to
*NL*
pay
the
bill
.
The
host
was
alone
,
seated
before
his
desk
,
one
of
the
*NL*
drawers
of
which
was
partly
open
.
He
took
the
money
which
Athos
offered
*NL*
to
him
,
and
after
turning
and
turning
it
over
and
over
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
suddenly
cried
out
that
it
was
bad
,
and
that
he
would
have
him
and
his
*NL*
companions
arrested
as
forgers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
blackguard
!
''
cried
Athos
,
going
toward
him
,
``
I
'll
cut
your
ears
*NL*
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
,
four
men
,
armed
to
the
teeth
,
entered
by
side
*NL*
doors
,
and
rushed
upon
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
taken
!
''
shouted
Athos
,
with
all
the
power
of
his
lungs
.
``
Go
on
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
!
Spur
,
spur
!
''
and
he
fired
two
pistols
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
Planchet
did
not
require
twice
bidding
;
they
unfastened
*NL*
the
two
horses
that
were
waiting
at
the
door
,
leaped
upon
them
,
buried
*NL*
their
spurs
in
their
sides
,
and
set
off
at
full
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
has
become
of
Athos
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
of
Planchet
,
as
*NL*
they
galloped
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
,
``
I
saw
one
fall
at
each
of
his
two
shots
,
*NL*
and
he
appeared
to
me
,
through
the
glass
door
,
to
be
fighting
with
his
*NL*
sword
with
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brave
Athos
!
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
to
think
that
we
are
compelled
*NL*
to
leave
him
;
maybe
the
same
fate
awaits
us
two
paces
hence
.
Forward
,
*NL*
Planchet
,
forward
!
You
are
a
brave
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
told
you
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Planchet
,
``
Picards
are
found
out
by
*NL*
being
used
.
Besides
,
I
am
here
in
my
own
country
,
and
that
excites
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
both
,
with
free
use
of
the
spur
,
arrived
at
St.
Omer
without
drawing
*NL*
bit
.
At
St.
Omer
they
breathed
their
horses
with
the
bridles
passed
*NL*
under
their
arms
for
fear
of
accident
,
and
ate
a
morsel
from
their
hands
*NL*
on
the
stones
of
the
street
,
after
they
departed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
hundred
paces
from
the
gates
of
Calais
,
d'Artagnan
's
horse
gave
*NL*
out
,
and
could
not
by
any
means
be
made
to
get
up
again
,
the
blood
*NL*
flowing
from
his
eyes
and
his
nose
.
There
still
remained
Planchet
's
*NL*
horse
;
but
he
stopped
short
,
and
could
not
be
made
to
move
a
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
as
we
have
said
,
they
were
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
*NL*
city
;
they
left
their
two
nags
upon
the
high
road
,
and
ran
toward
the
*NL*
quay
.
Planchet
called
his
master
's
attention
to
a
gentleman
who
had
just
*NL*
arrived
with
his
lackey
,
and
only
preceded
them
by
about
fifty
paces
.
*NL*
They
made
all
speed
to
come
up
to
this
gentleman
,
who
appeared
to
be
in
*NL*
great
haste
.
His
boots
were
covered
with
dust
,
and
he
inquired
if
he
*NL*
could
not
instantly
cross
over
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
would
be
more
easy
,
''
said
the
captain
of
a
vessel
ready
to
set
*NL*
sail
,
``
but
this
morning
came
an
order
to
let
no
one
leave
without
*NL*
express
permission
from
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
that
permission
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
drawing
the
paper
from
his
*NL*
pocket
;
``
here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
it
examined
by
the
governor
of
the
port
,
''
said
the
shipmaster
,
*NL*
``
and
give
me
the
preference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
I
find
the
governor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
his
country
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
situated
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
a
quarter
of
a
league
from
the
city
.
Look
,
you
may
see
it
from
*NL*
here
--
at
the
foot
of
that
little
hill
,
that
slated
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
And
,
with
his
lackey
,
he
took
the
road
*NL*
to
the
governor
's
country
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
Planchet
followed
the
gentleman
at
a
distance
of
five
*NL*
hundred
paces
.
Once
outside
the
city
,
d'Artagnan
overtook
the
gentleman
*NL*
as
he
was
entering
a
little
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
you
appear
to
be
in
great
haste
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
be
more
so
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
for
as
I
am
in
great
haste
*NL*
likewise
,
I
wish
to
beg
you
to
render
me
a
service

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
let
me
sail
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
impossible

''
said
the
gentleman
;
``
I
have
traveled
sixty
leagues
*NL*
in
forty
hours
,
and
by
tomorrow
at
midday
I
must
be
in
London

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
performed
that

distance
in
forty
hours
,

by
ten
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
I

be
in
London

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sorry

monsieur

I
was
here
first

will
not
sail
second

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
too

monsieur

but
I
arrived
second
,
and
must
sail
first

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
king
's
service

said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
service

''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
a
needless
quarrel

seek
with
me

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
wish
that
order

my

pistols

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
,
''
called
out
d'Artagnan
,
``
take
care
of
the
lackey
;
I
will
*NL*
manage
the
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
,
emboldened
by
the
first
exploit
,
sprang
upon
Lubin
;
and
being
*NL*
strong
and
vigorous
,
he
soon
got
him
on
the
broad
of
his
back
,
and
*NL*
placed
his
knee
upon
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
with
your
affair
,
monsieur
,
''
cried
Planchet
;
``
I
have
finished
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
,
the
gentleman
drew
his
sword
,
and
sprang
upon
d'Artagnan
;
*NL*
but
he
had
too
strong
an
adversary
.
In
three
seconds
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
wounded
him
three
times
,
exclaiming
at
each
thrust
,
``
One
for
Athos
,
one
*NL*
for
Porthos
;
and
one
for
Aramis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
third
hit
the
gentleman
fell
like
a
log
.
D'Artagnan
believed
him
*NL*
to
be
dead
,
or
at
least
insensible
,
and
went
toward
him
for
the
purpose
*NL*
of
taking
the
order
;
but
the
moment
he
extended
his
hand
to
search
for
*NL*
it
,
the
wounded
man
,
who
had
not
dropped
his
sword
,
plunged
the
point
*NL*
into
d'Artagnan
's
breast
,
crying
,
``
One
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
for
me
--
the
best
for
last
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
furious
,
nailing
*NL*
him
to
the
earth
with
a
fourth
thrust
through
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
gentleman
closed
his
eyes
and
fainted
.
D'Artagnan
searched
*NL*
his
pockets
,
and
took
from
one
of
them
the
order
for
the
passage
.
It
was
*NL*
in
the
name
of
Comte
de
Wardes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
casting
a
glance
on
the
handsome
young
man
,
who
was
scarcely
*NL*
twenty-five
years
of
age
,
and
whom
he
was
leaving
in
his
gore
,
deprived
*NL*
of
sense
and
perhaps
dead
,
he
gave
a
sigh
for
that
unaccountable
destiny
*NL*
which
leads
men
to
destroy
each
other
for
the
interests
of
people
who
*NL*
are
strangers
to
them
and
who
often
do
not
even
know
that
they
exist
.
*NL*
But
he
was
soon
aroused
from
these
reflections
by
Lubin
,
who
uttered
*NL*
loud
cries
and
screamed
for
help
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
grasped
him
by
the
throat
,
and
pressed
as
hard
as
he
could
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
long
as
I
hold
him
in
this
manner
,
he
ca
n't
*NL*
cry
,
I
'll
be
bound
;
but
as
soon
as
I
let
go
he
will
howl
again
.
I
know
*NL*
him
for
a
Norman
,
and
Normans
are
obstinate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
tightly
held
as
he
was
,
Lubin
endeavored
still
to
cry
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
and
taking
out
his
handkerchief
,
he
gagged
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Planchet
,
``
let
us
bind
him
to
a
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
properly
done
,
they
drew
the
Comte
de
Wardes
close
to
his
*NL*
servant
;
and
as
night
was
approaching
,
and
as
the
wounded
man
and
the
*NL*
bound
man
were
at
some
little
distance
within
the
wood
,
it
was
evident
*NL*
they
were
likely
to
remain
there
till
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
to
the
Governor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
wounded
,
it
seems
,
''
said
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
nothing
!
Let
us
attend
to
what
is
more
pressing
first
,
and
*NL*
then
we
will
attend
to
my
wound
;
besides
,
it
does
not
seem
very
*NL*
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
both
set
forward
as
fast
as
they
could
toward
the
country
house
*NL*
of
the
worthy
functionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Comte
de
Wardes
was
announced
,
and
d'Artagnan
was
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
an
order
signed
by
the
cardinal
?
''
said
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
It
is
quite
regular
and
explicit
,
''
said
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
likely
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
am
one
of
his
most
faithful
*NL*
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
his
Eminence
is
anxious
to
prevent
someone
from
*NL*
crossing
to
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
a
certain
d'Artagnan
,
a
Bearnese
gentleman
who
left
Paris
in
*NL*
company
with
three
of
his
friends
,
with
the
intention
of
going
to
*NL*
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
him
personally
?
''
asked
the
governor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Describe
him
to
me
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
more
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
gave
,
feature
for
feature
,
a
description
of
the
Comte
de
*NL*
Wardes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
accompanied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
by
a
lackey
named
Lubin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
them
;
and
if
we
lay
hands
on
them
his
*NL*
Eminence
may
be
assured
they
will
be
reconducted
to
Paris
under
a
good
*NL*
escort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
doing
so
,
Monsieur
the
Governor
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
will
*NL*
deserve
well
of
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
see
him
on
your
return
,
Monsieur
Count
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
a
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
,
I
beg
you
,
that
I
am
his
humble
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Delighted
with
this
assurance
the
governor
countersigned
the
passport
*NL*
and
delivered
it
to
d'Artagnan
.
D'Artagnan
lost
no
time
in
useless
*NL*
compliments
.
He
thanked
the
governor
,
bowed
,
and
departed
.
Once
outside
,
*NL*
he
and
Planchet
set
off
as
fast
as
they
could
;
and
by
making
a
long
*NL*
detour
avoided
the
wood
and
reentered
the
city
by
another
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vessel
was
quite
ready
to
sail
,
and
the
captain
was
waiting
on
the
*NL*
wharf
.
``
Well
?
''
said
he
,
on
perceiving
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
my
pass
countersigned
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
other
gentleman
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
not
go
today
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
here
,
I
'll
pay
you
for
us
*NL*
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
let
us
go
,
''
said
the
shipmaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
repeated
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaped
with
Planchet
into
the
boat
,
and
five
minutes
after
they
were
*NL*
on
board
.
It
was
time
;
for
they
had
scarcely
sailed
half
a
league
,
when
*NL*
d'Artagnan
saw
a
flash
and
heard
a
detonation
.
It
was
the
cannon
which
*NL*
announced
the
closing
of
the
port
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
now
leisure
to
look
to
his
wound
.
Fortunately
,
as
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
thought
,
it
was
not
dangerous
.
The
point
of
the
sword
had
touched
a
rib
,
*NL*
and
glanced
along
the
bone
.
Still
further
,
his
shirt
had
stuck
to
the
*NL*
wound
,
and
he
had
lost
only
a
few
drops
of
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
.
A
mattress
was
laid
upon
the
deck
*NL*
for
him
.
He
threw
himself
upon
it
,
and
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
at
break
of
day
,
they
were
still
three
or
four
leagues
*NL*
from
the
coast
of
England
.
The
breeze
had
been
so
light
all
night
,
they
*NL*
had
made
but
little
progress
.
At
ten
o'clock
the
vessel
cast
anchor
in
*NL*
the
harbor
of
Dover
,
and
at
half
past
ten
d'Artagnan
placed
his
foot
on
*NL*
English
land
,
crying
,
``
Here
I
am
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
was
not
all
;
they
must
get
to
London
.
In
England
the
post
was
*NL*
well
served
.
D'Artagnan
and
Planchet
took
each
a
post
horse
,
and
a
*NL*
postillion
rode
before
them
.
In
a
few
hours
they
were
in
the
capital
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
not
know
London
;
he
did
not
know
a
word
of
English
;
but
*NL*
he
wrote
the
name
of
Buckingham
on
a
piece
of
paper
,
and
everyone
*NL*
pointed
out
to
him
the
way
to
the
duke
's
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
was
at
Windsor
hunting
with
the
king
.
D'Artagnan
inquired
for
*NL*
the
confidential
valet
of
the
duke
,
who
,
having
accompanied
him
in
all
*NL*
his
voyages
,
spoke
French
perfectly
well
;
he
told
him
that
he
came
from
*NL*
Paris
on
an
affair
of
life
and
death
,
and
that
he
must
speak
with
his
*NL*
master
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confidence
with
which
d'Artagnan
spoke
convinced
Patrick
,
which
was
*NL*
the
name
of
this
minister
of
the
minister
.
He
ordered
two
horses
to
be
*NL*
saddled
,
and
himself
went
as
guide
to
the
young
Guardsman
.
As
for
*NL*
Planchet
,
he
had
been
lifted
from
his
horse
as
stiff
as
a
rush
;
the
poor
*NL*
lad
's
strength
was
almost
exhausted
.
D'Artagnan
seemed
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
arrival
at
the
castle
they
learned
that
Buckingham
and
the
king
*NL*
were
hawking
in
the
marshes
two
or
three
leagues
away
.
In
twenty
minutes
*NL*
they
were
on
the
spot
named
.
Patrick
soon
caught
the
sound
of
his
*NL*
master
's
voice
calling
his
falcon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
must
I
announce
to
my
Lord
Duke
?
''
asked
Patrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man
who
one
evening
sought
a
quarrel
with
him
on
the
Pont
*NL*
Neuf
,
opposite
the
Samaritaine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
singular
introduction
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
that
it
is
as
good
as
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
galloped
off
,
reached
the
duke
,
and
announced
to
him
in
the
*NL*
terms
directed
that
a
messenger
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
at
once
remembered
the
circumstance
,
and
suspecting
that
*NL*
something
was
going
on
in
France
of
which
it
was
necessary
he
should
be
*NL*
informed
,
he
only
took
the
time
to
inquire
where
the
messenger
was
,
and
*NL*
recognizing
from
afar
the
uniform
of
the
Guards
,
he
put
his
horse
into
a
*NL*
gallop
,
and
rode
straight
up
to
d'Artagnan
.
Patrick
discreetly
kept
in
*NL*
the
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
misfortune
has
happened
to
the
queen
?
''
cried
Buckingham
,
the
instant
*NL*
he
came
up
,
throwing
all
his
fear
and
love
into
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
not
;
nevertheless
I
believe
she
runs
some
great
peril
from
*NL*
which
your
Grace
alone
can
extricate
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
cried
Buckingham
.
``
What
is
it
?
I
should
be
too
happy
to
be
of
any
*NL*
service
to
her
.
Speak
,
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
letter
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
letter
!
From
whom
comes
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
her
Majesty
,
as
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
her
Majesty
!
''
said
Buckingham
,
becoming
so
pale
that
d'Artagnan
*NL*
feared
he
would
faint
as
he
broke
the
seal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
rent
?
''
said
he
,
showing
d'Artagnan
a
place
where
it
had
*NL*
been
pierced
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
did
not
see
that
;
it
was
the
sword
of
the
*NL*
Comte
de
Wardes
which
made
that
hole
,
when
he
gave
me
a
good
thrust
in
*NL*
the
breast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wounded
?
''
asked
Buckingham
,
as
he
opened
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
but
a
scratch
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
heaven
,
what
have
I
read
?
''
cried
the
duke
.
``
Patrick

remain
here

rather
join

wherever

humbly
beg
him
to

an
affair
of
the
greatest
importance
*NL*
recalls
me
to
London

come

and
both
set
off
towards

the
capital
at
full
gallop

21
THE
COUNTESS
DE
WINTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
rode
along
,
the
duke
endeavored
to
draw
from
d'Artagnan
,
not
all
*NL*
that
had
happened
,
but
what
d'Artagnan
himself
knew
.
By
adding
all
that
*NL*
he
heard
from
the
mouth
of
the
young
man
to
his
own
remembrances
,
he
was
*NL*
enabled
to
form
a
pretty
exact
idea
of
a
position
of
the
seriousness
of
*NL*
which
,
for
the
rest
,
the
queen
's
letter
,
short
but
explicit
,
gave
him
*NL*
the
clue
.
But
that
which
astonished
him
most
was
that
the
cardinal
,
so
*NL*
deeply
interested
in
preventing
this
young
man
from
setting
his
foot
in
*NL*
England
,
had
not
succeeded
in
arresting
him
on
the
road
.
It
was
then
,
*NL*
upon
the
manifestation
of
this
astonishment
,
that
d'Artagnan
related
to
*NL*
him
the
precaution
taken
,
and
how
,
thanks
to
the
devotion
of
his
three
*NL*
friends
,
whom
he
had
left
scattered
and
bleeding
on
the
road
,
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
coming
off
with
a
single
sword
thrust
,
which
had
pierced
*NL*
the
queen
's
letter
and
for
which
he
had
repaid
M.
de
Wardes
with
such
*NL*
terrible
coin
.
While
he
was
listening
to
this
recital
,
delivered
with
*NL*
the
greatest
simplicity
,
the
duke
looked
from
time
to
time
at
the
young
*NL*
man
with
astonishment
,
as
if
he
could
not
comprehend
how
so
much
*NL*
prudence
,
courage
,
and
devotedness
could
be
allied
with
a
countenance
*NL*
which
indicated
not
more
than
twenty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
went
like
the
wind
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
the
*NL*
gates
of
London
.
D'Artagnan
imagined
that
on
arriving
in
town
the
duke
*NL*
would
slacken
his
pace
,
but
it
was
not
so
.
He
kept
on
his
way
at
the
*NL*
same
rate
,
heedless
about
upsetting
those
whom
he
met
on
the
road
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
in
crossing
the
city
two
or
three
accidents
of
this
kind
happened
;
*NL*
but
Buckingham
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
see
what
became
of
those
he
*NL*
had
knocked
down
.
D'Artagnan
followed
him
amid
cries
which
strongly
*NL*
resembled
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
court
of
his
hotel
,
Buckingham
sprang
from
his
horse
,
*NL*
and
without
thinking
what
became
of
the
animal
,
threw
the
bridle
on
his
*NL*
neck
,
and
sprang
toward
the
vestibule
.
D'Artagnan
did
the
same
,
with
a
*NL*
little
more
concern
,
however
,
for
the
noble
creatures
,
whose
merits
he
*NL*
fully
appreciated
;
but
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
three
or
four
*NL*
grooms
run
from
the
kitchens
and
the
stables
,
and
busy
themselves
with
*NL*
the
steeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
walked
so
fast
that
d'Artagnan
had
some
trouble
in
keeping
up
*NL*
with
him
.
He
passed
through
several
apartments
,
of
an
elegance
of
which
*NL*
even
the
greatest
nobles
of
France
had
not
even
an
idea
,
and
arrived
at
*NL*
length
in
a
bedchamber
which
was
at
once
a
miracle
of
taste
and
of
*NL*
richness
.
In
the
alcove
of
this
chamber
was
a
door
concealed
in
the
*NL*
tapestry
which
the
duke
opened
with
a
little
gold
key
which
he
wore
*NL*
suspended
from
his
neck
by
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
.
With
discretion
*NL*
d'Artagnan
remained
behind
;
but
at
the
moment
when
Buckingham
crossed
*NL*
the
threshold
,
he
turned
round
,
and
seeing
the
hesitation
of
the
young
*NL*
man
,
``
Come
in
!
''
cried
he
,
``
and
if
you
have
the
good
fortune
to
be
*NL*
admitted
to
her
Majesty
's
presence
,
tell
her
what
you
have
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraged
by
this
invitation
,
d'Artagnan
followed
the
duke
,
who
closed
*NL*
the
door
after
them
.
The
two
found
themselves
in
a
small
chapel
covered
*NL*
with
a
tapestry
of
Persian
silk
worked
with
gold
,
and
brilliantly
*NL*
lighted
with
a
vast
number
of
candles
.
Over
a
species
of
altar
,
and
*NL*
beneath
a
canopy
of
blue
velvet
,
surmounted
by
white
and
red
plumes
,
was
*NL*
a
full-length
portrait
of
Anne
of
Austria
,
so
perfect
in
its
resemblance
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
on
beholding
it
.
One
might
*NL*
believe
the
queen
was
about
to
speak
.
On
the
altar
,
and
beneath
the
*NL*
portrait
,
was
the
casket
containing
the
diamond
studs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
approached
the
altar
,
knelt
as
a
priest
might
have
done
before
*NL*
a
crucifix
,
and
opened
the
casket
.
``
There
,
''
said
he
,
drawing
from
the
*NL*
casket
a
large
bow
of
blue
ribbon
all
sparkling
with
diamonds
,
``
there
*NL*
are
the
precious
studs
which
I
have
taken
an
oath
should
be
buried
with
*NL*
me
.
The
queen
gave
them
to
me
,
the
queen
requires
them
again
.
Her
will
*NL*
be
done
,
like
that
of
God
,
in
all
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
he
began
to
kiss
,
one
after
the
other
,
those
dear
studs
with
which
*NL*
he
was
about
to
part
.
All
at
once
he
uttered
a
terrible
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
exclaimed
d'Artagnan
,
anxiously
;
``
what
has
*NL*
happened
to
you
,
my
Lord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
lost
!
''
cried
Buckingham
,
becoming
as
pale
as
a
corpse
;
``
two
of
*NL*
the
studs
are
wanting
,
there
are
only
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
have
lost
them
,
my
Lord
,
or
do
you
think
they
have
been
*NL*
stolen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
been
stolen
,
''
replied
the
duke
,
``
and
it
is
the
cardinal
who
*NL*
has
dealt
this
blow
.
Hold
;
see
!
The
ribbons
which
held
them
have
been
*NL*
cut
with
scissors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
Lord
suspects
they
have
been
stolen
,
perhaps
the
person
who
stole
*NL*
them
still
has
them
in
his
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
wait
!
''
said
the
duke
.
``
The
only
time
I
have
worn
these
studs
was
*NL*
at
a
ball
given
by
the
king
eight
days
ago
at
Windsor
.
The
Comtesse
de
*NL*
Winter
,
with
whom
I
had
quarreled
,
became
reconciled
to
me
at
that
ball
.
*NL*
That
reconciliation
was
nothing
but
the
vengeance
of
a
jealous
woman
.
I
*NL*
have
never
seen
her
from
that
day
.
The
woman
is
an
agent
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
agents
,
then
,
throughout
the
world
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Buckingham
,
grating
his
teeth
with
rage
.
``
Yes
,
he
is
a
*NL*
terrible
antagonist
.
But
when
is
this
ball
to
take
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monday
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monday
next
!
Still
five
days
before
us
.
That
's
more
time
than
we
want
.
*NL*
Patrick
!
''
cried
the
duke
,
opening
the
door
of
the
chapel
,
``
Patrick
!
''
His
*NL*
confidential
valet
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
jeweler
and
my
secretary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
went
out
with
a
mute
promptitude
which
showed
him
accustomed
*NL*
to
obey
blindly
and
without
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
the
jeweler
had
been
mentioned
first
,
it
was
the
secretary
*NL*
who
first
made
his
appearance
.
This
was
simply
because
he
lived
in
the
*NL*
hotel
.
He
found
Buckingham
seated
at
a
table
in
his
bedchamber
,
writing
*NL*
orders
with
his
own
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jackson
,
''
said
he
,
``
go
instantly
to
the
Lord
Chancellor
,
and
tell
*NL*
him
that
I
charge
him
with
the
execution
of
these
orders
.
I
wish
them
to
*NL*
be
promulgated
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
Lord
,
if
the
Lord
Chancellor
interrogates
me
upon
the
motives
*NL*
which
may
have
led
your
Grace
to
adopt
such
an
extraordinary
measure
,
*NL*
what
shall
I
reply
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
such
is
my
pleasure
,
and
that
I
answer
for
my
will
to
no
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
that
be
the
answer
,
''
replied
the
secretary
,
smiling
,
``
which
he
*NL*
must
transmit
to
his
Majesty
if
,
by
chance
,
his
Majesty
should
have
the
*NL*
curiosity
to
know
why
no
vessel
is
to
leave
any
of
the
ports
of
Great
*NL*
Britain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
''
replied
Buckingham
.
``
He
will
say
,
in
that
*NL*
case
,
to
the
king
that
I
am
determined
on
war
,
and
that
this
measure
is
*NL*
my
first
act
of
hostility
against
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
secretary
bowed
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
safe
on
that
side
,
''
said
Buckingham
,
turning
toward
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
``
If
the
studs
are
not
yet
gone
to
Paris
,
they
will
not
arrive
till
after
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
placed
an
embargo
on
all
vessels
at
present
in
his
*NL*
Majesty
's
ports
,
and
without
particular
permission
,
not
one
dare
lift
an
*NL*
anchor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
looked
with
stupefaction
at
a
man
who
thus
employed
the
*NL*
unlimited
power
with
which
he
was
clothed
by
the
confidence
of
a
king
in
*NL*
the
prosecution
of
his
intrigues
.
Buckingham
saw
by
the
expression
of
*NL*
the
young
man
's
face
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
,
and
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
yes
,
Anne
of
Austria
is
my
true
queen
.
Upon
a
word
from
*NL*
her
,
I
would
betray
my
country
,
I
would
betray
my
king
,
I
would
betray
*NL*
my
God
.
She
asked
me
not
to
send
the
Protestants
of
La
Rochelle
the
*NL*
assistance
I
promised
them
;
I
have
not
done
so
.
I
broke
my
word
,
it
is
*NL*
true
;
but
what
signifies
that
?
I
obeyed
my
love
;
and
have
I
not
been
*NL*
richly
paid
for
that
obedience
?
It
was
to
that
obedience
I
owe
her
*NL*
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
amazed
to
note
by
what
fragile
and
unknown
threads
the
*NL*
destinies
of
nations
and
the
lives
of
men
are
suspended
.
He
was
lost
in
*NL*
these
reflections
when
the
goldsmith
entered
.
He
was
an
Irishman
--
one
of
*NL*
the
most
skillful
of
his
craft
,
and
who
himself
confessed
that
he
gained
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
livres
a
year
by
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
O'Reilly
,
''
said
the
duke
,
leading
him
into
the
chapel
,
``
look
at
*NL*
these
diamond
studs
,
and
tell
me
what
they
are
worth
apiece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goldsmith
cast
a
glance
at
the
elegant
manner
in
which
they
were
*NL*
set
,
calculated
,
one
with
another
,
what
the
diamonds
were
worth
,
and
*NL*
without
hesitation
said
,
``
Fifteen
hundred
pistoles
each
,
my
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
days
would
it
require
to
make
two
studs
exactly
like
them
?
You
*NL*
see
there
are
two
wanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
days
,
my
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
give
you
three
thousand
pistoles
apiece
if
I
can
have
them
by
*NL*
the
day
after
tomorrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
they
shall
be
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
jewel
of
a
man
,
Mr.
O'Reilly
;
but
that
is
not
all
.
These
*NL*
studs
can
not
be
trusted
to
anybody
;
it
must
be
done
in
the
palace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
,
my
Lord
!
There
is
no
one

so
execute

*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore

my

you
are
my

so
make
the
best
of
it

*NL*
such
of
your
workmen
as
you
need
,
and
point
out
the
tools
they
must
*NL*
bring

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goldsmith
knew
the
duke
.
He
knew
all
objection
would
be
useless
,
and
*NL*
instantly
determined
how
to
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
be
permitted
to
inform
my
wife
?

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
may
even
see
her
if
you
like

my
dear
Mr.
O'Reilly

Your
*NL*
captivity
shall
be
mild
,
be
assured
;
and
as
every
inconvenience
deserves
*NL*
its
indemnification
,
here
is
,
in
addition
to
the
price
of
the
studs
,
an
*NL*
order
for
a
thousand
pistoles
,
to
make
you
forget
the
annoyance
I
cause
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
could
not
get
over
the
surprise
created
in
him
by
this
*NL*
minister
,
who
thus
open-handed
,
sported
with
men
and
millions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
goldsmith
,
he
wrote
to
his
wife
,
sending
her
the
order
for
the
*NL*
thousand
pistoles
,
and
charging
her
to
send
him
,
in
exchange
,
his
most
*NL*
skillful
apprentice
,
an
assortment
of
diamonds
,
of
which
he
gave
the
*NL*
names
and
the
weight
,
and
the
necessary
tools
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
conducted
the
goldsmith
to
the
chamber
destined
for
him
,
and
*NL*
which
,
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
was
transformed
into
a
workshop
.
Then
*NL*
he
placed
a
sentinel
at
each
door
,
with
an
order
to
admit
nobody
upon
*NL*
any
pretense
but
his
VALET
DE
CHAMBRE
,
Patrick
.
We
need
not
add
that
the
*NL*
goldsmith
,
O'Reilly
,
and
his
assistant
,
were
prohibited
from
going
out
*NL*
under
any
pretext
.
This
point
,
settled
,
the
duke
turned
to
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
young
friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
England
is
all
our
own
.
What
do
you
*NL*
wish
for
?
What
do
you
desire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bed
,
my
Lord
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
At
present
,
I
confess
,
that
is
*NL*
the
thing
I
stand
most
in
need
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
gave
d'Artagnan
a
chamber
adjoining
his
own
.
He
wished
to
*NL*
have
the
young
man
at
hand
--
not
that
he
at
all
mistrusted
him
,
but
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
having
someone
to
whom
he
could
constantly
talk
of
the
*NL*
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
hour
after
,
the
ordinance
was
published
in
London
that
no
vessel
*NL*
bound
for
France
should
leave
port
,
not
even
the
packet
boat
with
*NL*
letters
.
In
the
eyes
of
everybody
this
was
a
declaration
of
war
between
*NL*
the
two
kingdoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
after
the
morrow
,
by
eleven
o'clock
,
the
two
diamond
studs
*NL*
were
finished
,
and
they
were
so
completely
imitated
,
so
perfectly
alike
,
*NL*
that
Buckingham
could
not
tell
the
new
ones
from
the
old
ones
,
and
*NL*
experts
in
such
matters
would
have
been
deceived
as
he
was
.
He
*NL*
immediately
called
d'Artagnan
.
``
Here
,
''
said
he
to
him
,
``
are
the
diamond
*NL*
studs
that
you
came
to
bring
;
and
be
my
witness
that
I
have
done
all
*NL*
that
human
power
could
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
,
my
Lord
,
I
will
tell
all
that
I
have
seen
.
But
does
your
*NL*
Grace
mean
to
give
me
the
studs
without
the
casket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
casket
would
encumber
you
.
Besides
,
the
casket
is
the
more
precious
*NL*
from
being
all
that
is
left
to
me
.
You
will
say
that
I
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
perform
your
commission
,
word
for
word
,
my
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
resumed
Buckingham
,
looking
earnestly
at
the
young
man
,
``
how
*NL*
shall
I
ever
acquit
myself
of
the
debt
I
owe
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
blushed
up
to
the
whites
of
his
eyes
.
He
saw
that
the
duke
*NL*
was
searching
for
a
means
of
making
him
accept
something
and
the
idea
*NL*
that
the
blood
of
his
friends
and
himself
was
about
to
be
paid
for
with
*NL*
English
gold
was
strangely
repugnant
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
understand
each
other
,
my
Lord
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
let
us
*NL*
make
things
clear
beforehand
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
.
I
am
*NL*
in
the
service
of
the
King
and
Queen
of
France
,
and
form
part
of
the
*NL*
company
of
Monsieur
Dessessart
,
who
,
as
well
as
his
brother-in-law
,
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
is
particularly
attached
to
their
Majesties
.
What
*NL*
I
have
done
,
then
,
has
been
for
the
queen
,
and
not
at
all
for
your
*NL*
Grace
.
And
still
further
,
it
is
very
probable
I
should
not
have
done
*NL*
anything
of
this
,
if
it
had
not
been
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
someone
*NL*
who
is
my
lady
,
as
the
queen

the

In

give

a
horse
all

and
will
point
out
to

the

You

D'Artagnan
bowed
to
the
duke
,
and
made
his
way
as
quickly
as
possible
to
*NL*
the
riverside
.
Opposite
the
Tower
of
London
he
found
the
vessel
that
had
*NL*
been
named
to
him
,
delivered
his
letter
to
the
captain
,
who
after
having
*NL*
it
examined
by
the
governor
of
the
port
made
immediate
preparations
to
*NL*
sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fifty
vessels
were
waiting
to
set
out
.
Passing
alongside
one
of
them
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
fancied
he
perceived
on
board
it
the
woman
of
Meung
--
the
same
*NL*
whom
the
unknown
gentleman
had
called
Milady
,
and
whom
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
thought
so
handsome
;
but
thanks
to
the
current
of
the
stream
and
a
fair
*NL*
wind
,
his
vessel
passed
so
quickly
that
he
had
little
more
than
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
landed
at
St.
Valery
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
went
instantly
in
search
of
the
inn
,
and
easily
discovered
it
*NL*
by
the
riotous
noise
which
resounded
from
it
.
War
between
England
and
*NL*
France
was
talked
of
as
near
and
certain
,
and
the
jolly
sailors
were
*NL*
having
a
carousal
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
advanced
toward
the
host
,
and
*NL*
pronounced
the
word
``
Forward
!
''
The
host
instantly
made
him
a
sign
to
*NL*
follow
,
went
out
with
him
by
a
door
which
opened
into
a
yard
,
led
him
to
*NL*
the
stable
,
where
a
saddled
horse
awaited
him
,
and
asked
him
if
he
stood
*NL*
in
need
of
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
the
route

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
from
hence
to
Blangy

the
tavern
of
the
Golden
Harrow
,
give
the

landlord

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

*NL*
``

cried
the
young

,
and
set
off
at
full
gallop

*NL*
*NL*
Four
hours
later
he
was
in
Neufchatel
.
He
strictly
followed
the
*NL*
instructions
he
had
received
.
At
Neufchatel
,
as
at
St.
Valery
,
he
found
*NL*
a
horse
quite
ready
and
awaiting
him
.
He
was
about
to
remove
the
pistols
*NL*
from
the
saddle
he
had
quit
to
the
one
he
was
about
to
fill
,
but
he
*NL*
found
the
holsters
furnished
with
similar
pistols

*NL*
*NL*
``

in

village

in

there
is

one
tavern

the
*NL*
Shield

Do

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
shook
his
head
,
and
set
off
at
full
speed
.
At
Eccuis
,
the
*NL*
same
scene
was
repeated
.
He
found
as
provident
a
host
and
a
fresh
horse
.
*NL*
He
left
his
address
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
set
off
again
at
the
same
*NL*
pace
for
Pontoise
.
At
Pontoise
he
changed
his
horse
for
the
last
time
,
*NL*
and
at
nine
o'clock
galloped
into
the
yard
of
Treville
's
hotel
.
He
had
*NL*
made
nearly
sixty
leagues
in
little
more
than
twelve
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
received
him
as
if
he
had
seen
him
that

morning
;
*NL*
only
,
when
pressing
his
hand
a
little
more
warmly
than
usual
,
he
*NL*
informed
him
that
the
company
of
Dessessart
was
on
duty
at
the
Louvre
,

that

repair
at

THE
BALLET
OF
LA
MERLAISON
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
nothing
was
talked
of
in
Paris
but
the
ball
which
the
*NL*
aldermen
of
the
city
were
to
give
to
the
king
and
queen
,
and
in
which
*NL*
their
Majesties
were
to
dance
the
famous
La
Merlaison
--
the
favorite
*NL*
ballet
of
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
days
had
been
occupied
in
preparations
at
the
Hotel
de
Ville
for
*NL*
this
important
evening
.
The
city
carpenters
had
erected
scaffolds
upon
*NL*
which
the
invited
ladies
were
to
be
placed
;
the
city
grocer
had
*NL*
ornamented
the
chambers
with
two
hundred
FLAMBEAUX
of
white
wax
,
a
piece
*NL*
of
luxury
unheard
of
at
that
period
;
and
twenty
violins
were
ordered
,
*NL*
and
the
price
for
them
fixed
at
double
the
usual
rate
,
upon
condition
,
*NL*
said
the
report
,
that
they
should
be
played
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
Sieur
de
la
Coste
,
ensign
in
the
*NL*
king
's
Guards
,
followed
by
two
officers
and
several
archers
of
that
*NL*
body
,
came
to
the
city
registrar
,
named
Clement
,
and
demanded
of
him
all
*NL*
the
keys
of
the
rooms
and
offices
of
the
hotel
.
These
keys
were
given
up
*NL*
to
him
instantly
.
Each
of
them
had
ticket
attached
to
it
,
by
which
it
*NL*
might
be
recognized
;
and
from
that
moment
the
Sieur
de
la
Coste
was
*NL*
charged
with
the
care
of
all
the
doors
and
all
the
avenues
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
came
in
his
turn
Duhallier
,
captain
of
the
Guards
,
*NL*
bringing
with
him
fifty
archers
,
who
were
distributed
immediately
*NL*
through
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
at
the
doors
assigned
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
three
o'clock
came
two
companies
of
the
Guards
,
one
French
,
the
other
*NL*
Swiss
.
The
company
of
French
guards
was
composed
of
half
of
M.
*NL*
Duhallier
's
men
and
half
of
M.
Dessessart
's
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
in
the
evening
the
guests
began
to
come
.
As
fast
as
they
entered
,
*NL*
they
were
placed
in
the
grand
saloon
,
on
the
platforms
prepared
for
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
Madame
la
Premiere
Presidente
arrived
.
As
next
to
the
*NL*
queen
,
she
was
the
most
considerable
personage
of
the
fete
,
she
was
*NL*
received
by
the
city
officials
,
and
placed
in
a
box
opposite
to
that
*NL*
which
the
queen
was
to
occupy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
,
the
king
's
collation
,
consisting
of
preserves
and
other
*NL*
delicacies
,
was
prepared
in
the
little
room
on
the
side
of
the
church
of
*NL*
St.
Jean
,
in
front
of
the
silver
buffet
of
the
city
,
which
was
guarded
*NL*
by
four
archers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
great
cries
and
loud
acclamations
were
heard
.
It
was
the
*NL*
king
,
who
was
passing
through
the
streets
which
led
from
the
Louvre
to
*NL*
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
and
which
were
all
illuminated
with
colored
*NL*
lanterns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
the
aldermen
,
clothed
in
their
cloth
robes
and
preceded
by
*NL*
six
sergeants
,
each
holding
a
FLAMBEAU
in
his
hand
,
went
to
attend
upon
*NL*
the
king
,
whom
they
met
on
the
steps
,
where
the
provost
of
the
merchants
*NL*
made
him
the
speech
of
welcome
--
a
compliment
to
which
his
Majesty
*NL*
replied
with
an
apology
for
coming
so
late
,
laying
the
blame
upon
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
who
had
detained
him
till
eleven
o'clock
,
talking
of
affairs
*NL*
of
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Majesty
,
in
full
dress
,
was
accompanied
by
his
royal
Highness
,
M.
le
*NL*
Comte
de
Soissons
,
by
the
Grand
Prior
,
by
the
Duc
de
Longueville
,
by
the
*NL*
Duc
d'Euboeuf
,
by
the
Comte
d'Harcourt
,
by
the
Comte
de
la
Roche-Guyon
,
*NL*
by
M.
de
Liancourt
,
by
M.
de
Baradas
,
by
the
Comte
de
Cramail
,
and
by
*NL*
the
Chevalier
de
Souveray
.
Everybody
noticed
that
the
king
looked
dull
*NL*
and
preoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
private
room
had
been
prepared
for
the
king
and
another
for
Monsieur
.
*NL*
In
each
of
these
closets
were
placed
masquerade
dresses
.
The
same
had
*NL*
been
done
for
the
queen
and
Madame
the
President
.
The
nobles
and
ladies
*NL*
of
their
Majesties
'
suites
were
to
dress
,
two
by
two
,
in
chambers
*NL*
prepared
for
the
purpose
.
Before
entering
his
closet
the
king
desired
to
*NL*
be
informed
the
moment
the
cardinal
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
after
the
entrance
of
the
king
,
fresh
acclamations
were
*NL*
heard
;
these
announced
the
arrival
of
the
queen
.
The
aldermen
did
as
*NL*
they
had
done
before
,
and
preceded
by
their
sergeants
,
advanced
to
*NL*
receive
their
illustrious
guest
.
The
queen
entered
the
great
hall
;
and
*NL*
it
was
remarked
that
,
like
the
king
,
she
looked
dull
and
even
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
she
entered
,
the
curtain
of
a
small
gallery
which
to
that
*NL*
time
had
been
closed
,
was
drawn
,
and
the
pale
face
of
the
cardinal
*NL*
appeared
,
he
being
dressed
as
a
Spanish
cavalier
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
*NL*
upon
those
of
the
queen
,
and
a
smile
of
terrible
joy
passed
over
his
*NL*
lips
;
the
queen
did
not
wear
her
diamond
studs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
remained
for
a
short
time
to
receive
the
compliments
of
the
*NL*
city
dignitaries
and
to
reply
to
the
salutations
of
the
ladies
.
All
at
*NL*
once
the
king
appeared
with
the
cardinal
at
one
of
the
doors
of
the
*NL*
hall
.
The
cardinal
was
speaking
to
him
in
a
low
voice
,
and
the
king
was
*NL*
very
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
without
a
mask
,
and
the
ribbons
*NL*
of
his
doublet
scarcely
tied
.
He
went
straight
to
the
queen
,
and
in
an
*NL*
altered
voice
said
,
``
Why
,
madame
,
have
you
not
thought
proper
to
wear
*NL*
your
diamond
studs
,
when
you
know
it
would
give
me
so
much
*NL*
gratification
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
cast
a
glance
around
her
,
and
saw
the
cardinal
behind
,
with
a
*NL*
diabolical
smile
on
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
replied
the
queen
,
with
a
faltering
voice
,
``
because
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
such
a
crowd
as
this
,
I
feared
some
accident
might
happen
to
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
were
wrong
,
madame
.
If
I
made
you
that
present
it
was
that
you
*NL*
might
adorn
yourself
therewith
.
I
tell
you
that
you
were
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
king
was
tremulous
with
anger
.
Everybody
looked
and
*NL*
listened
with
astonishment
,
comprehending
nothing
of
what
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
said
the
queen
,
``
I
can
send
for
them
to
the
Louvre
,
where
they
*NL*
are
,
and
thus
your
Majesty
's
wishes
will
be
complied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
so
,
madame
,
do
so
,
and
that
at
once
;
for
within
an
hour
the
ballet
*NL*
will
commence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
bent
in
token
of
submission
,
and
followed
the
ladies
who
were
*NL*
to
conduct
her
to
her
room
.
On
his
part
the
king
returned
to
his
*NL*
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
trouble
and
confusion
in
the
assembly
.
Everybody
*NL*
had
remarked
that
something
had
passed
between
the
king
and
queen
;
but
*NL*
both
of
them
had
spoken
so
low
that
everybody
,
out
of
respect
,
withdrew
*NL*
several
steps
,
so
that
nobody
had
heard
anything
.
The
violins
began
to
*NL*
sound
with
all
their
might
,
but
nobody
listened
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
came
out
first
from
his
room
.
He
was
in
a
most
elegant
hunting
*NL*
costume
;
and
Monsieur
and
the
other
nobles
were
dressed
like
him
.
This
*NL*
was
the
costume
that
best
became
the
king
.
So
dressed
,
he
really
*NL*
appeared
the
first
gentleman
of
his
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
drew
near
to
the
king
,
and
placed
in
his
hand
a
small
*NL*
casket
.
The
king
opened
it
,
and
found
in
it
two
diamond
studs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
''
demanded
he
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
the
latter
;
``
only
,
if
the
queen
has
the
studs
,
which
*NL*
I
very
much
doubt
,
count
them
,
sire
,
and
if
you
only
find
ten
,
ask
her
*NL*
Majesty
who
can
have
stolen
from
her
the
two
studs
that
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
looked
at
the
cardinal
as
if
to
interrogate
him
;
but
he
had
not
*NL*
time
to
address
any
question
to
him
--
a
cry
of
admiration
burst
from
*NL*
every
mouth
.
If
the
king
appeared
to
be
the
first
gentleman
of
his
*NL*
kingdom
,
the
queen
was
without
doubt
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
the
habit
of
a
huntress
became
her
admirably
.
She
wore
a
*NL*
beaver
hat
with
blue
feathers
,
a
surtout
of
gray-pearl
velvet
,
fastened
*NL*
with
diamond
clasps
,
and
a
petticoat
of
blue
satin
,
embroidered
with
*NL*
silver
.
On
her
left
shoulder
sparkled
the
diamond
studs
,
on
a
bow
of
the
*NL*
same
color
as
the
plumes
and
the
petticoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
trembled
with
joy
and
the
cardinal
with
vexation
;
although
,
*NL*
distant
as
they
were
from
the
queen
,
they
could
not
count
the
studs
.
The
*NL*
queen
had
them
.
The
only
question
was
,
had
she
ten
or
twelve
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
violins
sounded
the
signal
for
the
ballet
.
The
king
*NL*
advanced
toward
Madame
the
President
,
with
whom
he
was
to
dance
,
and
his
*NL*
Highness
Monsieur
with
the
queen
.
They
took
their
places
,
and
the
ballet
*NL*
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
danced
facing
the
queen
,
and
every
time
he
passed
by
her
,
he
*NL*
devoured
with
his
eyes
those
studs
of
which
he
could
not
ascertain
the
*NL*
number
.
A
cold
sweat
covered
the
brow
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ballet
lasted
an
hour
,
and
had
sixteen
ENTREES
.
The
ballet
ended
*NL*
amid
the
applause
of
the
whole
assemblage
,
and
everyone
reconducted
his
*NL*
lady
to
her
place
;
but
the
king
took
advantage
of
the
privilege
he
had
*NL*
of
leaving
his
lady
,
to
advance
eagerly
toward
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
madame
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
the
deference
you
have
shown
to
my
*NL*
wishes
,
but
I
think
you
want
two
of
the
studs
,
and
I
bring
them
back
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
he
held
out
to
the
queen
the
two
studs
the
cardinal
had
*NL*
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
sire
?
''
cried
the
young
queen
,
affecting
surprise
,
``
you
are
giving
*NL*
me
,
then
,
two
more
:
I
shall
have
fourteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
the
king
counted
them
,
and
the
twelve
studs
were
all
on
her
*NL*
Majesty
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
called
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
,
Monsieur
Cardinal
?
''
asked
the
king
in
a
severe
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
means
,
sire
,
''
replied
the
cardinal
,
``
that
I
was
desirous
of
*NL*
presenting
her
Majesty
with
these
two
studs
,
and
that
not
daring
to
*NL*
offer
them
myself
,
I
adopted
this
means
of
inducing
her
to
accept
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
the
more
grateful
to
your
Eminence
,
''
replied
Anne
of
Austria
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
that
proved
she
was
not
the
dupe
of
this
ingenious
*NL*
gallantry
,
``
from
being
certain
that
these
two
studs
alone
have
cost
you
*NL*
as
much
as
all
the
others
cost
his
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
saluting
the
king
and
the
cardinal
,
the
queen
resumed
her
way
to
*NL*
the
chamber
in
which
she
had
dressed
,
and
where
she
was
to
take
off
her
*NL*
costume
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attention
which
we
have
been
obliged
to
give
,
during
the
*NL*
commencement
of
the
chapter
,
to
the
illustrious
personages
we
have
*NL*
introduced
into
it
,
has
diverted
us
for
an
instant
from
him
to
whom
Anne
*NL*
of
Austria
owed
the
extraordinary
triumph
she
had
obtained
over
the
*NL*
cardinal
;
and
who
,
confounded
,
unknown
,
lost
in
the
crowd
gathered
at
*NL*
one
of
the
doors
,
looked
on
at
this
scene
,
comprehensible
only
to
four
*NL*
persons
--
the
king
,
the
queen
,
his
Eminence
,
and
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
had
just
regained
her
chamber
,
and
d'Artagnan
was
about
to
*NL*
retire
,
when
he
felt
his
shoulder
lightly
touched
.
He
turned
and
saw
a
*NL*
young
woman
,
who
made
him
a
sign
to
follow
her
.
The
face
of
this
young
*NL*
woman
was
covered
with
a
black
velvet
mask
;
but
notwithstanding
this
*NL*
precaution
,
which
was
in
fact
taken
rather
against
others
than
against
*NL*
him
,
he
at
once
recognized
his
usual
guide
,
the
light
and
intelligent
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
before
,
they
had
scarcely
seen
each
other
for
a
moment
at
*NL*
the
apartment
of
the
Swiss
guard
,
Germain
,
whither
d'Artagnan
had
sent
*NL*
for
her
.
The
haste
which
the
young
woman
was
in
to
convey
to
the
queen
*NL*
the
excellent
news
of
the
happy
return
of
her
messenger
prevented
the
*NL*
two
lovers
from
exchanging
more
than
a
few
words
.
D'Artagnan
therefore
*NL*
followed
Mme.
Bonacieux
moved
by
a
double
sentiment
--
love
and
curiosity
.
*NL*
All
the
way
,
and
in
proportion
as
the
corridors
became
more
deserted
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
wished
to
stop
the
young
woman
,
seize
her
and
gaze
upon
her
,
*NL*
were
it
only
for
a
minute
;
but
quick
as
a
bird
she
glided
between
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
when
he
wished
to
speak
to
her
,
her
finger
placed
upon
her
*NL*
mouth
,
with
a
little
imperative
gesture
full
of
grace
,
reminded
him
that
*NL*
he
was
under
the
command
of
a
power
which
he
must
blindly
obey
,
and
*NL*
which
forbade
him
even
to
make
the
slightest
complaint
.
At
length
,
after
*NL*
winding
about
for
a
minute
or
two
,
Mme.
Bonacieux
opened
the
door
of
a
*NL*
closet
,
which
was
entirely
dark
,
and
led
d'Artagnan
into
it
.
There
she
*NL*
made
a
fresh
sign
of
silence
,
and
opened
a
second
door
concealed
by
*NL*
tapestry
.
The
opening
of
this
door
disclosed
a
brilliant
light
,
and
she
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
for
a
moment
motionless
,
asking
himself
where
he
*NL*
could
be
;
but
soon
a
ray
of
light
which
penetrated
through
the
chamber
,
*NL*
together
with
the
warm
and
perfumed
air
which
reached
him
from
the
same
*NL*
aperture
,
the
conversation
of
two
of
three
ladies
in
language
at
once
*NL*
respectful
and
refined
,
and
the
word
``
Majesty
''
several
times
repeated
,
*NL*
indicated
clearly
that
he
was
in
a
closet
attached
to
the
queen
's
*NL*
apartment
.
The
young
man
waited
in
comparative
darkness
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
appeared
cheerful
and
happy
,
which
seemed
to
astonish
the
*NL*
persons
who
surrounded
her
and
who
were
accustomed
to
see
her
almost
*NL*
always
sad
and
full
of
care
.
The
queen
attributed
this
joyous
feeling
to
*NL*
the
beauty
of
the
fete
,
to
the
pleasure
she
had
experienced
in
the
*NL*
ballet
;
and
as
it
is
not
permissible
to
contradict
a
queen
,
whether
she
*NL*
smile
or
weep
,
everybody
expatiated
on
the
gallantry
of
the
aldermen
of
*NL*
the
city
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
d'Artagnan
did
not
at
all
know
the
queen
,
he
soon
distinguished
*NL*
her
voice
from
the
others
,
at
first
by
a
slightly
foreign
accent
,
and
*NL*
next
by
that
tone
of
domination
naturally
impressed
upon
all
royal
*NL*
words
.
He
heard
her
approach
and
withdraw
from
the
partially
open
door
;
*NL*
and
twice
or
three
times
he
even
saw
the
shadow
of
a
person
intercept
*NL*
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
hand
and
an
arm
,
surpassingly
beautiful
in
their
form
and
*NL*
whiteness
,
glided
through
the
tapestry
.
D'Artagnan
at
once
comprehended
*NL*
that
this
was
his
recompense
.
He
cast
himself
on
his
knees
,
seized
the
*NL*
hand
,
and
touched
it
respectfully
with
his
lips
.
Then
the
hand
was
*NL*
withdrawn
,
leaving
in
his
an
object
which
he
perceived
to
be
a
ring
.
The
*NL*
door
immediately
closed
,
and
d'Artagnan
found
himself
again
in
complete
*NL*
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
placed
the
ring
on
his
finger
,
and
again
waited
;
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
all
was
not
yet
over
.
After
the
reward
of
his
devotion
,
*NL*
that
of
his
love
was
to
come
.
Besides
,
although
the
ballet
was
danced
,
*NL*
the
evening
had
scarcely
begun
.
Supper
was
to
be
served
at
three
,
and
*NL*
the
clock
of
St.
Jean
had
struck
three
quarters
past
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
voices
diminished
by
degrees
in
the
adjoining
chamber
.
The
*NL*
company
was
then
heard
departing
;
then
the
door
of
the
closet
in
which
*NL*
d'Artagnan
was
,
was
opened
,
and
Mme.
Bonacieux
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
at
last
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
said
the
young
woman
,
placing
her
hand
upon
his
lips
;
*NL*
``
silence
,
and
go
the
same
way
you
came
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
and
when
shall
I
see
you
again
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
note
which
you
will
find
at
home
will
tell
you
.
Begone
,
begone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
she
opened
the
door
of
the
corridor
,
and
pushed
*NL*
d'Artagnan
out
of
the
room
.
D'Artagnan
obeyed
like
a
child
,
without
the
*NL*
least
resistance
or
objection
,
which
proved
that
he
was
really
in
love
.

THE
RENDEZVOUS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
ran
home
immediately
,
and
although
it
was
three
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
and
he
had
some
of
the
worst
quarters
of
Paris
to
traverse
,
*NL*
he
met
with
no
misadventure
.
Everyone
knows
that
drunkards
and
lovers
*NL*
have
a
protecting
deity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
door
of
his
passage
open
,
sprang
up
the
stairs
and
knocked
*NL*
softly
in
a
manner
agreed
upon
between
him
and
his
lackey
.
Planchet
*
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
sent
home
two
hours
before
from
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
telling
*NL*
him
to
sit
up
for
him
,
opened
the
door
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
*
The
reader
may
ask
,
``
How
came
Planchet
here
?
''
when
he
was
left
*NL*
``
stiff
as
a
rush
''
in
London
.
In
the
intervening
time
*NL*
Buckingham
perhaps
sent
him
to
Paris
,
as
he
did
the
*NL*
horses
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anyone
brought
a
letter
for
me
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
has
BROUGHT
a
letter
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Planchet
;
``
but
one
has
*NL*
come
of
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
blockhead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
that
when
I
came
in
,
although
I
had
the
key
of
your
*NL*
apartment
in
my
pocket
,
and
that
key
had
never
quit
me
,
I
found
a
letter
*NL*
on
the
green
table
cover
in
your
bedroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
is
that
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
it
where
I
found
it
,
monsieur
.
It
is
not
natural
for
letters
to
*NL*
enter
people
's
houses
in
this
manner
.
If
the
window
had
been
open
or
*NL*
even
ajar
,
I
should
think
nothing
of
it
;
but
,
no
--
all
was
hermetically
*NL*
sealed
.
Beware
,
monsieur
;
there
is
certainly
some
magic
underneath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
young
man
had
darted
in
to
his
chamber
,
and
opened
the
*NL*
letter
.
It
was
from
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
and
was
expressed
in
these
terms
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
many
thanks
to
be
offered
to
you
,
and
to
be
transmitted
to
*NL*
you
.
Be
this
evening
about
ten
o'clock
at
St.
Cloud
,
in
front
of
the
*NL*
pavilion
which
stands
at
the
corner
of
the
house
of
M.
d'Estrees
.

C.B.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
reading
this
letter
,
d'Artagnan
felt
his
heart
dilated
and
*NL*
compressed
by
that
delicious
spasm
which
tortures
and
caresses
the
*NL*
hearts
of
lovers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
billet
he
had
received
;
it
was
the
first
rendezvous
*NL*
that
had
been
granted
him
.
His
heart
,
swelled
by
the
intoxication
of
*NL*
joy
,
felt
ready
to
dissolve
away
at
the
very
gate
of
that
terrestrial
*NL*
paradise
called
Love
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
,
who
had
observed
his
master
grow
red
*NL*
and
pale
successively
,
``
did
I
not
guess
truly
?
Is
it
not
some
bad
*NL*
affair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Planchet
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
as
a
proof
,
there
*NL*
is
a
crown
to
drink
my
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
Monsieur
for
the
crown
he
had
given
me
,
and
I
*NL*
promise
him
to
follow
his
instructions
exactly
;
but
it
is
not
the
less
*NL*
true
that
letters
which
come
in
this
way
into
shut-up
houses
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fall
from
heaven
,
my
friend
,
fall
from
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
Monsieur
is
satisfied
?
''
asked
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Planchet
,
I
am
the
happiest
of
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
may
profit
by
Monsieur
's
happiness
,
and
go
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
the
blessings
of
heaven
fall
upon
Monsieur

But
it
is
not
the
less
*NL*
true
that
that
letter
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Planchet
retired
,
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
doubt
,
which
the
*NL*
liberality
of
d'Artagnan
had
not
entirely
effaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
d'Artagnan
read
and
reread
his
billet
.
Then
he
kissed
and
*NL*
rekissed
twenty
times
the
lines
traced
by
the
hand
of
his
beautiful
*NL*
mistress
.
At
length
he
went
to
bed
,
fell
asleep
,
and
had
golden
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
he
arose
and
called
Planchet
,
who
at
the
*NL*
second
summons
opened
the
door
,
his
countenance
not
yet
quite
freed
from
*NL*
the
anxiety
of
the
preceding
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
am
going
out
for
all
day
,
perhaps
.
You
*NL*
are
,
therefore
,
your
own
master
till
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
;
but
*NL*
at
seven
o'clock
you
must
hold
yourself
in
readiness
with
two
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Planchet
.
``
We
are
going
again
,
it
appears
,
to
have
our
*NL*
hides
pierced
in
all
sorts
of
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
take
your
musketoon
and
your
pistols
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
!
Did
n't
I
say
so
?
''
cried
Planchet
.
``
I
was
sure
of
it
--
the
*NL*
cursed
letter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
you
idiot
;
there
is
nothing
in
hand
but
a
party
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
like
the
charming
journey
the
other
day
,
when
it
rained
bullets
and
*NL*
produced
a
crop
of
steel
traps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
are
really
afraid
,
Monsieur
Planchet
,
''
resumed
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
``
I
will
go
without
you
.
I
prefer
traveling
alone
to
having
a
companion
*NL*
who
entertains
the
least
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
does
me
wrong
,
''
said
Planchet
;
``
I
thought
he
had
seen
me
at
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
thought
perhaps
you
had
worn
out
all
your
courage
the
first
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
shall
see
that
upon
occasion
I
have
some
left
;
only
I
beg
*NL*
Monsieur
not
to
be
too
prodigal
of
it
if
he
wishes
it
to
last
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
you
have
still
a
certain
amount
of
it
to
expend
this
*NL*
evening
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
count
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
appointed
hour
I
shall
be
ready
;
only
I
believed
that
Monsieur
*NL*
had
but
one
horse
in
the
Guard
stables
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
there
is
but
one
at
this
moment
;
but
by
this
evening
there
will
*NL*
be
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
our
journey
was
a
remounting
journey
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
and
nodding
to
Planchet
,
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Bonacieux
was
at
his
door
.
D'Artagnan
's
intention
was
to
go
out
*NL*
without
speaking
to
the
worthy
mercer
;
but
the
latter
made
so
polite
and
*NL*
friendly
a
salutation
that
his
tenant
felt
obliged
,
not
only
to
stop
,
*NL*
but
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
how
is
it
possible
to
avoid
a
little
condescension
toward
a
*NL*
husband
whose
pretty
wife
has
appointed
a
meeting
with
you
that
same
*NL*
evening
at
St.
Cloud
,
opposite
D'Estrees
's
pavilion
?
D'Artagnan
*NL*
approached
him
with
the
most
amiable
air
he
could
assume
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
naturally
fell
upon
the
incarceration
of
the
poor
man
.
*NL*
M.
Bonacieux
,
who
was
ignorant
that
d'Artagnan
had
overheard
his
*NL*
conversation
with
the
stranger
of
Meung
,
related
to
his
young
tenant
the
*NL*
persecutions
of
that
monster
,
M.
de
Laffemas
,
whom
he
never
ceased
to
*NL*
designate
,
during
his
account
,
by
the
title
of
the
``
cardinal
's
*NL*
executioner
,
''
and
expatiated
at
great
length
upon
the
Bastille
,
the
*NL*
bolts
,
the
wickets
,
the
dungeons
,
the
gratings
,
the
instruments
of
*NL*
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
listened
to
him
with
exemplary
complaisance
,
and
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
said
,
``
And
Madame
Bonacieux
,
do
you
know
who
carried
her
*NL*
off
?
--
For
I
do
not
forget
that
I
owe
to
that
unpleasant
circumstance
the
*NL*
good
fortune
of
having
made
your
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Bonacieux
,
``
they
took
good
care
not
to
tell
me
that
;
and
my
*NL*
wife
,
on
her
part
,
has
sworn
to
me
by
all
that
's
sacred
that
she
does
*NL*
not
know
.
But
you
,
''
continued
M.
Bonacieux
,
in
a
tone
of
perfect
good
*NL*
fellowship
,
``
what
has
become
of
you
all
these
days
?
I
have
not
seen
you
*NL*
nor
your
friends
,
and
I
do
n't
think
you
could
gather
all
that
dust
that
*NL*
I
saw
Planchet
brush
off
your
boots
yesterday
from
the
pavement
of
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

my
dear
Monsieur
Bonacieux

my
friends

I
have
been
*NL*
on
a
little
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
from
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
,
no
!
About
forty
leagues
only
.
We
went
to
take
Monsieur
Athos
*NL*
to
the
waters
of
Forges
,
where
my
friends
still
remain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
returned
,
have
you
not
?
''
replied
M.
Bonacieux
,
giving
to
*NL*
his
countenance
a
most
sly
air
.
``
A
handsome
young
fellow
like
you
does
*NL*
not
obtain
long
leaves
of
absence
from
his
mistress
;
and
we
were
*NL*
impatiently
waited
for
at
Paris
,
were
we
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
!
''
said
the
young
man
,
laughing
,
``
I
confess
it
,
and
so
much
*NL*
more
the
readily
,
my
dear
Bonacieux
,
as
I
see
there
is
no
concealing
*NL*
anything
from
you
.
Yes
,
I
was
expected
,
and
very
impatiently
,
I
*NL*
acknowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
shade
passed
over
the
brow
of
Bonacieux
,
but
so
slight
that
*NL*
d'Artagnan
did
not
perceive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
are
going
to
be
recompensed
for
our
diligence
?
''
continued
the
*NL*
mercer
,
with
a
trifling
alteration
in
his
voice
--
so
trifling
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
did
not
perceive
it
any
more
than
he
had
the
momentary
*NL*
shade
which
,
an
instant
before
,
had
darkened
the
countenance
of
the
*NL*
worthy
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
may
you
be
a
true
prophet
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
what
I
say
,
''
replied
Bonacieux
,
``
is
only
that
I
may
know
whether
I
*NL*
am
delaying
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
question
,
my
dear
host
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
``
Do
you
intend
to
*NL*
sit
up
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
since
my
arrest
and
the
robbery
that
was
committed
in
my
house
,
*NL*
I
am
alarmed
every
time
I
hear
a
door
open
,
particularly
in
the
night
.
*NL*
What
the
deuce
can
you
expect
?
I
am
no
swordsman
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
be
alarmed
if
I
return
at
one
,
two
or
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
;
indeed
,
do
not
be
alarmed
if
I
do
not
come
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Bonacieux
became
so
pale
that
d'Artagnan
could
not
help
*NL*
perceiving
it
,
and
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
Bonacieux
,
``
nothing
.
Since
my
misfortunes
I
have
been
*NL*
subject
to
faintnesses
,
which
seize
me
all
at
once
,
and
I
have
just
felt
*NL*
a
cold
shiver
.
Pay
no
attention
to
it
;
you
have
nothing
to
occupy
*NL*
yourself
with
but
being
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
have
full
occupation
,
for
I
am
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
;
wait
a
little
!
This
evening
,
you
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
evening
will
come
,
thank
God
!
And
perhaps
you
look
for
it
*NL*
with
as
much
impatience
as
I
do
;
perhaps
this
evening
Madame
Bonacieux
*NL*
will
visit
the
conjugal
domicile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Bonacieux
is
not
at
liberty
this
evening
,
''
replied
the
husband
,
*NL*
seriously
;
``
she
is
detained
at
the
Louvre
this
evening
by
her
duties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
for
you
,
my
dear
host
,
so
much
the
worse
!
When
I
am
*NL*
happy
,
I
wish
all
the
world
to
be
so
;
but
it
appears
that
is
not
*NL*
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
departed
,
laughing
at
the
joke
,
which
he
thought
he
alone
*NL*
could
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amuse
yourself
well
!
''
replied
Bonacieux
,
in
a
sepulchral
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
was
too
far
off
to
hear
him
;
and
if
he
had
heard
him
in
*NL*
the
disposition
of
mind
he
then
enjoyed
,
he
certainly
would
not
have
*NL*
remarked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
way
toward
the
hotel
of
M.
de
Treville
;
his
visit
of
the
day
*NL*
before
,
it
is
to
be
remembered
,
had
been
very
short
and
very
little
*NL*
explicative
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Treville
in
a
joyful
mood
.
He
had
thought
the
king
and
queen
*NL*
charming
at
the
ball
.
It
is
true
the
cardinal
had
been
particularly
*NL*
ill-tempered
.
He
had
retired
at
one
o'clock
under
the
pretense
of
being
*NL*
indisposed
.
As
to
their
Majesties
,
they
did
not
return
to
the
Louvre
*NL*
till
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Treville
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
looking
into
every
corner
*NL*
of
the
apartment
to
see
if
they
were
alone
,
``
now
let
us
talk
about
*NL*
yourself
,
my
young
friend
;
for
it
is
evident
that
your
happy
return
has
*NL*
something
to
do
with
the
joy
of
the
king
,
the
triumph
of
the
queen
,
and
*NL*
the
humiliation
of
his
Eminence
.
You
must
look
out
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
fear
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
as
long
as
I
shall
have
the
*NL*
luck
to
enjoy
the
favor
of
their
Majesties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
believe
me
.
The
cardinal
is
not
the
man
to
forget
a
*NL*
mystification
until
he
has
settled
account
with
the
mystifier
;
and
the
*NL*
mystifier
appears
to
me
to
have
the
air
of
being
a
certain
young
Gascon
*NL*
of
my
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
believe
that
the
cardinal
is
as
well
posted

d'Artagnan
was
at
the
Hotel
des
Gardes
;
he
found
*NL*
Planchet
all
ready
.
The
fourth
horse
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
was
armed
with
his
musketoon
and
a
pistol
.
D'Artagnan
had
his
*NL*
sword
and
placed
two
pistols
in
his
belt
;
then
both
mounted
and
departed
*NL*
quietly
.
It
was
quite
dark
,
and
no
one
saw
them
go
out
.
Planchet
took
*NL*
place
behind
his
master
,
and
kept
at
a
distance
of
ten
paces
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
crossed
the
quays
,
went
out
by
the
gate
of
La
Conference
and
*NL*
followed
the
road
,
much
more
beautiful
then
than
it
is
now
,
which
leads
*NL*
to
St.
Cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
he
was
in
the
city
,
Planchet
kept
at
the
respectful
distance
*NL*
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
;
but
as
soon
as
the
road
began
to
be
more
*NL*
lonely
and
dark
,
he
drew
softly
nearer
,
so
that
when
they
entered
the
*NL*
Bois
de
Boulogne
he
found
himself
riding
quite
naturally
side
by
side
*NL*
with
his
master
.
In
fact
,
we
must
not
dissemble
that
the
oscillation
of
*NL*
the
tall
trees
and
the
reflection
of
the
moon
in
the
dark
underwood
gave
*NL*
him
serious
uneasiness
.
D'Artagnan
could
not
help
perceiving
that
*NL*
something
more
than
usual
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
his
lackey
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Well
,
Monsieur
Planchet
,
what
is
the
matter
with
us
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
,
monsieur
,
that
woods
are
like
churches
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
,
Planchet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
dare
not
speak
aloud
in
one
or
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
you
not
dare
to
speak
aloud
,
Planchet
--
because
you
are
*NL*
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
being
heard
?
Yes
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
of
being
heard
!
Why
,
there
is
nothing
improper
in
our
*NL*
conversation
,
my
dear
Planchet
,
and
no
one
could
find
fault
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
!
''
replied
Planchet
,
recurring
to
his
besetting
idea
,
``
that
*NL*
Monsieur
Bonacieux
has
something
vicious
in
his
eyebrows
,
and
something
*NL*
very
unpleasant
in
the
play
of
his
lips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
makes
you
think
of
Bonacieux
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
we
think
of
what
we
can
,
and
not
of
what
we
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
a
coward
,
Planchet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
we
must
not
confound
prudence
with
cowardice
;
prudence
is
a
*NL*
virtue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
very
virtuous
,
are
you
not
,
Planchet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
is
not
that
the
barrel
of
a
musket
which
glitters
yonder
?
Had
*NL*
we
not
better
lower
our
heads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
,
to
whom
M.
de
Treville
's
recommendation
*NL*
recurred
,
``
this
animal
will
end
by
making
me
afraid
.
''
And
he
put
his
*NL*
horse
into
a
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
followed
the
movements
of
his
master
as
if
he
had
been
his
*NL*
shadow
,
and
was
soon
trotting
by
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
going
to
continue
this
pace
all
night
?
''
asked
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
are
at
your
journey
's
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
monsieur
!
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
a
few
steps
farther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Monsieur
leaves
me
here
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
,
Planchet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
only
beg
leave
to
observe
to
Monsieur
that
the
night
will
be
very
*NL*
cold
,
that
chills
bring
on
rheumatism
,
and
that
a
lackey
who
has
the
*NL*
rheumatism
makes
but
a
poor
servant
,
particularly
to
a
master
as
active
*NL*
as
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
are
cold
,
Planchet
,
you
can
go
into
one
of
those
cabarets
*NL*
that
you
see
yonder
,
and
be
in
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
by
six
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
have
eaten
and
drunk
respectfully
the
crown
you
gave
me
*NL*
this
morning
,
so
that
I
have
not
a
sou
left
in
case
I
should
be
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
half
a
pistole
.
Tomorrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
sprang
from
his
horse
,
threw
the
bridle
to
Planchet
,
and
*NL*
departed
at
a
quick
pace
,
folding
his
cloak
around
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
how
cold
I
am
!
''
cried
Planchet
,
as
soon
as
he
had
lost
sight
*NL*
of
his
master
;
and
in
such
haste
was
he
to
warm
himself
that
he
went
*NL*
straight
to
a
house
set
out
with
all
the
attributes
of
a
suburban
*NL*
tavern
,
and
knocked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
plunged
into
a
bypath
,
continued
his
*NL*
route
and
reached
St.
Cloud
;
but
instead
of
following
the
main
street
he
*NL*
turned
behind
the
chateau
,
reached
a
sort
of
retired
lane
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
soon
in
front
of
the
pavilion
named
.
It
was
situated
in
a
very
*NL*
private
spot
.
A
high
wall
,
at
the
angle
of
which
was
the
pavilion
,
ran
*NL*
along
one
side
of
this
lane
,
and
on
the
other
was
a
little
garden
*NL*
connected
with
a
poor
cottage
which
was
protected
by
a
hedge
from
*NL*
passers-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gained
the
place
appointed
,
and
as
no
signal
had
been
given
him
by
*NL*
which
to
announce
his
presence
,
he
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
the
least
noise
was
to
be
heard
;
it
might
be
imagined
that
he
was
a
*NL*
hundred
miles
from
the
capital
.
D'Artagnan
leaned
against
the
hedge
,
*NL*
after
having
cast
a
glance
behind
it
.
Beyond
that
hedge
,
that
garden
,
*NL*
and
that
cottage
,
a
dark
mist
enveloped
with
its
folds
that
immensity
*NL*
where
Paris
slept
--
a
vast
void
from
which
glittered
a
few
luminous
*NL*
points
,
the
funeral
stars
of
that
hell
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
d'Artagnan
all
aspects
were
clothed
happily
,
all
ideas
wore
a
*NL*
smile
,
all
shades
were
diaphanous
.
The
appointed
hour
was
about
to
*NL*
strike
.
In
fact
,
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
the
belfry
of
St.
Cloud
let
*NL*
fall
slowly
ten
strokes
from
its
sonorous
jaws
.
There
was
something
*NL*
melancholy
in
this
brazen
voice
pouring
out
its
lamentations
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
night
;
but
each
of
those
strokes
,
which
made
up
the
*NL*
expected
hour
,
vibrated
harmoniously
to
the
heart
of
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
little
pavilion
situated
at
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
wall
,
of
which
all
the
windows
were
closed
with
shutters
,
except
one
*NL*
on
the
first
story
.
Through
this
window
shone
a
mild
light
which
*NL*
silvered
the
foliage
of
two
or
three
linden
trees
which
formed
a
group
*NL*
outside
the
park
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
that
behind
this
little
*NL*
window
,
which
threw
forth
such
friendly
beams
,
the
pretty
Mme.
Bonacieux
*NL*
expected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wrapped
in
this
sweet
idea
,
d'Artagnan
waited
half
an
hour
without
the
*NL*
least
impatience
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
that
charming
little
abode
of
*NL*
which
he
could
perceive
a
part
of
the
ceiling
with
its
gilded
moldings
,
*NL*
attesting
the
elegance
of
the
rest
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
belfry
of
St.
Cloud
sounded
half
past
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
without
knowing
why
,
d'Artagnan
felt
a
cold
shiver
run
*NL*
through
his
veins
.
Perhaps
the
cold
began
to
affect
him
,
and
he
took
a
*NL*
perfectly
physical
sensation
for
a
moral
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
idea
seized
him
that
he
had
read
incorrectly
,
and
that
the
*NL*
appointment
was
for
eleven
o'clock
.
He
drew
near
to
the
window
,
and
*NL*
placing
himself
so
that
a
ray
of
light
should
fall
upon
the
letter
as
he
*NL*
held
it
,
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
read
it
again
;
but
he
had
not
*NL*
been
mistaken
,
the
appointment
was
for
ten
o'clock
.
He
went
and
resumed
*NL*
his
post
,
beginning
to
be
rather
uneasy
at
this
silence
and
this
*NL*
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eleven
o'clock
sounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
began
now
really
to
fear
that
something
had
happened
to
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
.
He
clapped
his
hands
three
times
--
the
ordinary
signal
of
*NL*
lovers
;
but
nobody
replied
to
him
,
not
even
an
echo
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
thought
,
with
a
touch
of
vexation
,
that
perhaps
the
young
woman
*NL*
had
fallen
asleep
while
waiting
for
him
.
He
approached
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
climb
it
;
but
the
wall
had
been
recently
pointed
,
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
could
get
no
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
thought
of
the
trees
,
upon
whose
leaves
the
light
*NL*
still
shone
;
and
as
one
of
them
drooped
over
the
road
,
he
thought
that
*NL*
from
its
branches
he
might
get
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
of
the
*NL*
pavilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tree
was
easy
to
climb
.
Besides
,
d'Artagnan
was
but
twenty
years
*NL*
old
,
and
consequently
had
not
yet
forgotten
his
schoolboy
habits
.
In
an
*NL*
instant
he
was
among
the
branches
,
and
his
keen
eyes
plunged
through
the
*NL*
transparent
panes
into
the
interior
of
the
pavilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strange
thing
,
and
one
which
made
d'Artagnan
tremble
from
the
*NL*
sole
of
his
foot
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
,
to
find
that
this
soft
light
,
*NL*
this
calm
lamp
,
enlightened
a
scene
of
fearful
disorder
.
One
of
the
*NL*
windows
was
broken
,
the
door
of
the
chamber
had
been
beaten
in
and
hung
,
*NL*
split
in
two
,
on
its
hinges
.
A
table
,
which
had
been
covered
with
an
*NL*
elegant
supper
,
was
overturned
.
The
decanters
broken
in
pieces
,
and
the
*NL*
fruits
crushed
,
strewed
the
floor
.
Everything
in
the
apartment
gave
*NL*
evidence
of
a
violent
and
desperate
struggle
.
D'Artagnan
even
fancied
he
*NL*
could
recognize
amid
this
strange
disorder
,
fragments
of
garments
,
and
*NL*
some
bloody
spots
staining
the
cloth
and
the
curtains
.
He
hastened
to
*NL*
descend
into
the
street
,
with
a
frightful
beating
at
his
heart
;
he
*NL*
wished
to
see
if
he
could
find
other
traces
of
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
soft
light
shone
on
in
the
calmness
of
the
night
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
then
perceived
a
thing
that
he
had
not
before
remarked
--
for
nothing
had
*NL*
led
him
to
the
examination
--
that
the
ground
,
trampled
here
and
*NL*
hoofmarked
there
,
presented
confused
traces
of
men
and
horses
.
Besides
,
*NL*
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
,
which
appeared
to
have
come
from
Paris
,
had
*NL*
made
a
deep
impression
in
the
soft
earth
,
which
did
not
extend
beyond
*NL*
the
pavilion
,
but
turned
again
toward
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
d'Artagnan
,
in
pursuing
his
researches
,
found
near
the
wall
a
*NL*
woman
's
torn
glove
.
This
glove
,
wherever
it
had
not
touched
the
muddy
*NL*
ground
,
was
of
irreproachable
odor
.
It
was
one
of
those
perfumed
gloves
*NL*
that
lovers
like
to
snatch
from
a
pretty
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
d'Artagnan
pursued
his
investigations
,
a
more
abundant
and
more
icy
*NL*
sweat
rolled
in
large
drops
from
his
forehead
;
his
heart
was
oppressed
*NL*
by
a
horrible
anguish
;
his
respiration
was
broken
and
short
.
And
yet
he
*NL*
said
,
to
reassure
himself
,
that
this
pavilion
perhaps
had
nothing
in
*NL*
common
with
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
that
the
young
woman
had
made
an
appointment
*NL*
with
him
before
the
pavilion
,
and
not
in
the
pavilion
;
that
she
might
*NL*
have
been
detained
in
Paris
by
her
duties
,
or
perhaps
by
the
jealousy
of
*NL*
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
these
reasons
were
combated
,
destroyed
,
overthrown
,
by
that
*NL*
feeling
of
intimate
pain
which
,
on
certain
occasions
,
takes
possession
*NL*
of
our
being
,
and
cries
to
us
so
as
to
be
understood
unmistakably
that
*NL*
some
great
misfortune
is
hanging
over
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
became
almost
wild
.
He
ran
along
the
high
road
,
took
the
*NL*
path
he
had
before
taken
,
and
reaching
the
ferry
,
interrogated
the
*NL*
boatman
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
boatman
had
taken
over
a
young
*NL*
woman
,
wrapped
in
a
black
mantle
,
who
appeared
to
be
very
anxious
not
to
*NL*
be
recognized
;
but
entirely
on
account
of
her
precautions
,
the
boatman
*NL*
had
paid
more
attention
to
her
and
discovered
that
she
was
young
and
*NL*
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
then
,
as
now
,
a
crowd
of
young
and
pretty
women
who
came
to
*NL*
St.
Cloud
,
and
who
had
reasons
for
not
being
seen
,
and
yet
d'Artagnan
*NL*
did
not
for
an
instant
doubt
that
it
was
Mme.
Bonacieux
whom
the
boatman
*NL*
had
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
advantage
of
the
lamp
which
burned
in
the
cabin
of
the
*NL*
ferryman
to
read
the
billet
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
once
again
,
and
satisfy
*NL*
himself
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
,
that
the
appointment
was
at
St.
*NL*
Cloud
and
not
elsewhere
,
before
the
D'Estrees
's
pavilion
and
not
in
*NL*
another
street
.
Everything
conspired
to
prove
to
d'Artagnan
that
his
*NL*
presentiments
had
not
deceived
him
,
and
that
a
great
misfortune
had
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
ran
back
to
the
chateau
.
It
appeared
to
him
that
something
*NL*
might
have
happened
at
the
pavilion
in
his
absence
,
and
that
fresh
*NL*
information
awaited
him
.
The
lane
was
still
deserted
,
and
the
same
calm
*NL*
soft
light
shone
through
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
thought
of
that
cottage
,
silent
and
obscure
,
which
had
*NL*
no
doubt
seen
all
,
and
could
tell
its
tale
.
The
gate
of
the
enclosure
*NL*
was
shut
;
but
he
leaped
over
the
hedge
,
and
in
spite
of
the
barking
of
a
*NL*
chained-up
dog
,
went
up
to
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
answered
to
his
first
knocking
.
A
silence
of
death
reigned
in
the
*NL*
cabin
as
in
the
pavilion
;
but
as
the
cabin
was
his
last
resource
,
he
*NL*
knocked
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
soon
appeared
to
him
that
he
heard
a
slight
noise
within
--
a
timid
*NL*
noise
which
seemed
to
tremble
lest
it
should
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
ceased
knocking
,
and
prayed
with
an
accent
so
full
of
*NL*
anxiety
and
promises
,
terror
and
cajolery
,
that
his
voice
was
of
a
*NL*
nature
to
reassure
the
most
fearful
.
At
length
an
old
,
worm-eaten
*NL*
shutter
was
opened
,
or
rather
pushed
ajar
,
but
closed
again
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
light
from
a
miserable
lamp
which
burned
in
the
corner
had
shone
*NL*
upon
the
baldric
,
sword
belt
,
and
pistol
pommels
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
rapid
as
the
movement
had
been
,
d'Artagnan
had
had
time
to
*NL*
get
a
glimpse
of
the
head
of
an
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
!
''
cried
he
,
``
listen
to
me
;
I
have
been
waiting
*NL*
for
someone
who
has
not
come
.
I
am
dying
with
anxiety
.
Has
anything
*NL*
particular
happened
in
the
neighborhood
?
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
was
again
opened
slowly
,
and
the
same
face
appeared
,
only
it
*NL*
was
now
still
more
pale
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
his
story
simply
,
with
the
omission
of
names
.
He
told
*NL*
how
he
had
a
rendezvous
with
a
young
woman
before
that
pavilion
,
and
*NL*
how
,
not
seeing
her
come
,
he
had
climbed
the
linden
tree
,
and
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
lamp
had
seen
the
disorder
of
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
listened
attentively
,
making
a
sign
only
that
it
was
all
so
;
*NL*
and
then
,
when
d'Artagnan
had
ended
,
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
that
*NL*
announced
nothing
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
explain
*NL*
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
``
ask
me
nothing
;
for
if
I
dared
tell
*NL*
you
what
I
have
seen
,
certainly
no
good
would
befall
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
then
,
seen
something
?
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
In
that
case
,
in
*NL*
the
name
of
heaven
,
''
continued
he
,
throwing
him
a
pistole
,
``
tell
me
what
*NL*
you
have
seen
,
and
I
will
pledge
you
the
word
of
a
gentleman
that
not
*NL*
one
of
your
words
shall
escape
from
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
read
so
much
truth
and
so
much
grief
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
young
man
that
he
made
him
a
sign
to
listen
,
and
repeated
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
:
``
It
was
scarcely
nine
o'clock
when
I
heard
a
noise
in
the
street
,
*NL*
and
was
wondering
what
it
could
be
,
when
on
coming
to
my
door
,
I
found
*NL*
that
somebody
was
endeavoring
to
open
it
.
As
I
am
very
poor
and
am
not
*NL*
afraid
of
being
robbed
,
I
went
and
opened
the
gate
and
saw
three
men
at
*NL*
a
few
paces
from
it
.
In
the
shadow
was
a
carriage
with
two
horses
,
and
*NL*
some
saddlehorses
.
These
horses
evidently
belonged
to
the
three
men
,
who
*NL*
were
dressed
as
cavaliers
.
`
Ah
,
my
worthy
gentlemen
,
'
cried
I
,
`
what
do
*NL*
you
want
?
'
`
You
must
have
a
ladder
?
'
said
he
who
appeared
to
be
the
*NL*
leader
of
the
party
.
`
Yes
,
monsieur
,
the
one
with
which
I
gather
my
*NL*
fruit
.
'
`
Lend
it
to
us
,
and
go
into
your
house
again
;
there
is
a
crown
*NL*
for
the
annoyance
we
have
caused
you
.
Only
remember
this
--
if
you
speak
a
*NL*
word
of
what
you
may
see
or
what
you
may
hear
-LRB-
for
you
will
look
and
you
*NL*
will
listen
,
I
am
quite
sure
,
however
we
may
threaten
you
-RRB-
,
you
are
*NL*
lost
.
'
At
these
words
he
threw
me
a
crown
,
which
I
picked
up
,
and
he
*NL*
took
the
ladder
.
After
shutting
the
gate
behind
them
,
I
pretended
to
*NL*
return
to
the
house
,
but
I
immediately
went
out
a
back
door
,
and
*NL*
stealing
along
in
the
shade
of
the
hedge
,
I
gained
yonder
clump
of
*NL*
elder
,
from
which
I
could
hear
and
see
everything
.
The
three
men
brought
*NL*
the
carriage
up
quietly
,
and
took
out
of
it
a
little
man
,
stout
,
short
,
*NL*
elderly
,
and
commonly
dressed
in
clothes
of
a
dark
color
,
who
ascended
*NL*
the
ladder
very
carefully
,
looked
suspiciously
in
at
the
window
of
the
*NL*
pavilion
,
came
down
as
quietly
as
he
had
gone
up
,
and
whispered
,
`
It
is
*NL*
she
!
'
Immediately
,
he
who
had
spoken
to
me
approached
the
door
of
the
*NL*
pavilion
,
opened
it
with
a
key
he
had
in
his
hand
,
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
disappeared
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
other
two
men
ascended
the
*NL*
ladder
.
The
little
old
man
remained
at
the
coach
door
;
the
coachman
took
*NL*
care
of
his
horses
,
the
lackey
held
the
saddlehorses
.
All
at
once
great
*NL*
cries
resounded
in
the
pavilion
,
and
a
woman
came
to
the
window
,
and
*NL*
opened
it
,
as
if
to
throw
herself
out
of
it
;
but
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
perceived
the
other
two
men
,
she
fell
back
and
they
went
into
the
*NL*
chamber
.
Then
I
saw
no
more
;
but
I
heard
the
noise
of
breaking
*NL*
furniture
.
The
woman
screamed
,
and
cried
for
help
;
but
her
cries
were
*NL*
soon
stifled
.
Two
of
the
men
appeared
,
bearing
the
woman
in
their
arms
,
*NL*
and
carried
her
to
the
carriage
,
into
which
the
little
old
man
got
after
*NL*
her
.
The
leader
closed
the
window
,
came
out
an
instant
after
by
the
*NL*
door
,
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
woman
was
in
the
carriage
.
His
two
*NL*
companions
were
already
on
horseback
.
He
sprang
into
his
saddle
;
the
*NL*
lackey
took
his
place
by
the
coachman
;
the
carriage
went
off
at
a
quick
*NL*
pace
,
escorted
by
the
three
horsemen
,
and
all
was
over
.
From
that
moment
*NL*
I
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
entirely
overcome
by
this
terrible
story
,
remained
*NL*
motionless
and
mute
,
while
all
the
demons
of
anger
and
jealousy
were
*NL*
howling
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
good
gentleman
,
''
resumed
the
old
man
,
upon
whom
this
mute
*NL*
despair
certainly
produced
a
greater
effect
than
cries
and
tears
would
*NL*
have
done
,
``
do
not
take
on
so
;
they
did
not
kill
her
,
and
that
's
a
*NL*
comfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
guess
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
who
was
the
man
who
headed
this
*NL*
infernal
expedition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
you
spoke
to
him
you
must
have
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
description
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
tall
,
dark
man
,
with
black
mustaches
,
dark
eyes
,
and
the
air
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
man
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
again
he
,
forever
he
!
He
is
my
*NL*
demon
,
apparently
.
And
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
short
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
was
not
a
gentleman
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
;
besides
,
he
did
not
*NL*
wear
a
sword
,
and
the
others
treated
him
with
small
consideration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
lackey
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
``
Poor
woman
,
poor
woman
,
what
have
*NL*
they
done
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
promised
to
be
secret
,
my
good
monsieur
?
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
renew
my
promise
.
Be
easy
,
I
am
a
gentleman
.
A
gentleman
has
but
*NL*
his
word
,
and
I
have
given
you
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
heavy
heart
,
d'Artagnan
again
bent
his
way
toward
the
ferry
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
hoped
it
could
not
be
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
and
that
he
should
*NL*
find
her
next
day
at
the
Louvre
;
sometimes
he
feared
she
had
had
an
*NL*
intrigue
with
another
,
who
,
in
a
jealous
fit
,
had
surprised
her
and
*NL*
carried
her
off
.
His
mind
was
torn
by
doubt
,
grief
,
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
had
my
three
friends
here
,
''
cried
he
,
``
I
should
have
,
at
*NL*
least
,
some
hopes
of
finding
her
;
but
who
knows
what
has
become
of
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
midnight
;
the
next
thing
was
to
find
Planchet
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
went
successively
into
all
the
cabarets
in
which
there
was
a
light
,
but
*NL*
could
not
find
Planchet
in
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sixth
he
began
to
reflect
that
the
search
was
rather
dubious
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
appointed
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
for
his
lackey
,
and
*NL*
wherever
he
might
be
,
he
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
it
came
into
the
young
man
's
mind
that
by
remaining
in
the
*NL*
environs
of
the
spot
on
which
this
sad
event
had
passed
,
he
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
have
some
light
thrown
upon
the
mysterious
affair
.
At
the
sixth
*NL*
cabaret
,
then
,
as
we
said
,
d'Artagnan
stopped
,
asked
for
a
bottle
of
*NL*
wine
of
the
best
quality
,
and
placing
himself
in
the
darkest
corner
of
*NL*
the
room
,
determined
thus
to
wait
till
daylight
;
but
this
time
again
his
*NL*
hopes
were
disappointed
,
and
although
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
,
he
*NL*
heard
nothing
,
amid
the
oaths
,
coarse
jokes
,
and
abuse
which
passed
*NL*
between
the
laborers
,
servants
,
and
carters
who
comprised
the
honorable
*NL*
society
of
which
he
formed
a
part
,
which
could
put
him
upon
the
least
*NL*
track
of
her
who
had
been
stolen
from
him
.
He
was
compelled
,
then
,
after
*NL*
having
swallowed
the
contents
of
his
bottle
,
to
pass
the
time
as
well
as
*NL*
to
evade
suspicion
,
to
fall
into
the
easiest
position
in
his
corner
and
*NL*
to
sleep
,
whether
well
or
ill
.
D'Artagnan
,
be
it
remembered
,
was
only
*NL*
twenty
years
old
,
and
at
that
age
sleep
has
its
imprescriptible
rights
*NL*
which
it
imperiously
insists
upon
,
even
with
the
saddest
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
six
o'clock
d'Artagnan
awoke
with
that
uncomfortable
feeling
*NL*
which
generally
accompanies
the
break
of
day
after
a
bad
night
.
He
was
*NL*
not
long
in
making
his
toilet
.
He
examined
himself
to
see
if
advantage
*NL*
had
been
taken
of
his
sleep
,
and
having
found
his
diamond
ring
on
his
*NL*
finger
,
his
purse
in
his
pocket
,
and
his
pistols
in
his
belt
,
he
rose
,
*NL*
paid
for
his
bottle
,
and
went
out
to
try
if
he
could
have
any
better
*NL*
luck
in
his
search
after
his
lackey
than
he
had
had
the
night
before
.
*NL*
The
first
thing
he
perceived
through
the
damp
gray
mist
was
honest
*NL*
Planchet
,
who
,
with
the
two
horses
in
hand
,
awaited
him
at
the
door
of
a
*NL*
little
blind
cabaret
,
before
which
d'Artagnan
had
passed
without
even
a
*NL*
suspicion
of
its
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
25
PORTHOS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
returning
directly
home
,
d'Artagnan
alighted
at
the
door
of
*NL*
M.
de
Treville
,
and
ran
quickly
up
the
stairs
.
This
time
he
had
decided
*NL*
to
relate
all
that
had
passed
.
M.
de
Treville
would
doubtless
give
him
*NL*
good
advice
as
to
the
whole
affair
.
Besides
,
as
M.
de
Treville
saw
the
*NL*
queen
almost
daily
,
he
might
be
able
to
draw
from
her
Majesty
some
*NL*
intelligence
of
the
poor
young
woman
,
whom
they
were
doubtless
making
*NL*
pay
very
dearly
for
her
devotedness
to
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
listened
to
the
young
man
's
account
with
a
seriousness
*NL*
which
proved
that
he
saw
something
else
in
this
adventure
besides
a
love
*NL*
affair
.
When
d'Artagnan
had
finished
,
he
said
,
``
Hum
!
All
this
savors
of
*NL*
his
Eminence
,
a
league
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
to
be
done
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
,
at
present
,
but
quitting
Paris
,
as
I
told
*NL*
you
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
I
will
see
the
queen
;
I
will
relate
to
her
the
*NL*
details
of
the
disappearance
of
this
poor
woman
,
of
which
she
is
no
*NL*
doubt
ignorant
.
These
details
will
guide
her
on
her
part
,
and
on
your
*NL*
return
,
I
shall
perhaps
have
some
good
news
to
tell
you
.
Rely
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
knew
that
,
although
a
Gascon
,
M.
de
Treville
was
not
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
making
promises
,
and
that
when
by
chance
he
did
promise
,
he
*NL*
more
than
kept
his
word
.
He
bowed
to
him
,
then
,
full
of
gratitude
for
*NL*
the
past
and
for
the
future
;
and
the
worthy
captain
,
who
on
his
side
*NL*
felt
a
lively
interest
in
this
young
man
,
so
brave
and
so
resolute
,
*NL*
pressed
his
hand
kindly
,
wishing
him
a
pleasant
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Determined
to
put
the
advice
of
M.
de
Treville
in
practice
instantly
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
directed
his
course
toward
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
,
in
order
*NL*
to
superintend
the
packing
of
his
valise
.
On
approaching
the
house
,
he
*NL*
perceived
M.
Bonacieux
in
morning
costume
,
standing
at
his
threshold
.
*NL*
All
that
the
prudent
Planchet
had
said
to
him
the
preceding
evening
*NL*
about
the
sinister
character
of
the
old
man
recurred
to
the
mind
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
looked
at
him
with
more
attention
than
he
had
done
*NL*
before
.
In
fact
,
in
addition
to
that
yellow
,
sickly
paleness
which
*NL*
indicates
the
insinuation
of
the
bile
in
the
blood
,
and
which
might
,
*NL*
besides
,
be
accidental
,
d'Artagnan
remarked
something
perfidiously
*NL*
significant
in
the
play
of
the
wrinkled
features
of
his
countenance
.
A
*NL*
rogue
does
not
laugh
in
the
same
way
that
an
honest
man
does
;
a
*NL*
hypocrite
does
not
shed
the
tears
of
a
man
of
good
faith
.
All
falsehood
*NL*
is
a
mask
;
and
however
well
made
the
mask
may
be
,
with
a
little
*NL*
attention
we
may
always
succeed
in
distinguishing
it
from
the
true
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
,
then
,
to
d'Artagnan
that
M.
Bonacieux
wore
a
mask
,
and
*NL*
likewise
that
that
mask
was
most
disagreeable
to
look
upon
.
In
*NL*
consequence
of
this
feeling
of
repugnance
,
he
was
about
to
pass
without
*NL*
speaking
to
him
,
but
,
as
he
had
done
the
day
before
,
M.
Bonacieux
*NL*
accosted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
man
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
appear
to
pass
rather
gay
nights
!
Seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
!
PESTE
!
You
seem
to
reverse
ordinary
customs
,
and
*NL*
come
home
at
the
hour
when
other
people
are
going
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
can
reproach
you
for
anything
of
the
kind
,
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
''
*NL*
said
the
young
man
;
``
you
are
a
model
for
regular
people
.
It
is
true
that
*NL*
when
a
man
possesses
a
young
and
pretty
wife
,
he
has
no
need
to
seek
*NL*
happiness
elsewhere
.
Happiness
comes
to
meet
him
,
does
it
not
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Bonacieux
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bonacieux
became
as
pale
as
death
,
and
grinned
a
ghastly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
Bonacieux
,
``
you
are
a
jocular
companion
!
But
where
the
*NL*
devil
were
you
gladding
last
night
,
my
young
master
?
It
does
not
appear
*NL*
to
be
very
clean
in
the
crossroads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
glanced
down
at
his
boots
,
all
covered
with
mud
;
but
that
*NL*
same
glance
fell
upon
the
shoes
and
stockings
of
the
mercer
,
and
it
*NL*
might
have
been
said
they
had
been
dipped
in
the
same
mud
heap
.
Both
*NL*
were
stained
with
splashes
of
mud
of
the
same
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
sudden
idea
crossed
the
mind
of
d'Artagnan
.
That
little
stout
*NL*
man
,
short
and
elderly
,
that
sort
of
lackey
,
dressed
in
dark
clothes
,
*NL*
treated
without
ceremony
by
the
men
wearing
swords
who
composed
the
*NL*
escort
,
was
Bonacieux
himself
.
The
husband
had
presided
at
the
abduction
*NL*
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
inclination
seized
d'Artagnan
to
grasp
the
mercer
by
the
*NL*
throat
and
strangle
him
;
but
,
as
we
have
said
,
he
was
a
very
prudent
*NL*
youth
,
and
he
restrained
himself
.
However
,
the
revolution
which
appeared
*NL*
upon
his
countenance
was
so
visible
that
Bonacieux
was
terrified
at
it
,
*NL*
and
he
endeavored
to
draw
back
a
step
or
two
;
but
as
he
was
standing
*NL*
before
the
half
of
the
door
which
was
shut
,
the
obstacle
compelled
him
*NL*
to
keep
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
are
joking
,
my
worthy
man
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
It
appears
to
*NL*
me
that
if
my
boots
need
a
sponge
,
your
stockings
and
shoes
stand
in
*NL*
equal
need
of
a
brush
.
May
you
not
have
been
philandering
a
little
also
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Bonacieux
?
Oh
,
the
devil
!
That
's
unpardonable
in
a
man
of
your
*NL*
age
,
and
who
besides
,
has
such
a
pretty
wife
as
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
no
,
''
said
Bonacieux
,
``
but
yesterday
I
went
to
St.
Mande
to
*NL*
make
some
inquiries
after
a
servant
,
as
I
can
not
possibly
do
without
*NL*
one
;
and
the
roads
were
so
bad
that
I
brought
back
all
this
mud
,
which
I
*NL*
have
not
yet
had
time
to
remove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
named
by
Bonacieux
as
that
which
had
been
the
object
of
his
*NL*
journey
was
a
fresh
proof
in
support
of
the
suspicions
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
conceived
.
Bonacieux
had
named
Mande
because
Mande
was
in
an
exactly
*NL*
opposite
direction
from
St.
Cloud
.
This
probability
afforded
him
his
*NL*
first
consolation
.
If
Bonacieux
knew
where
his
wife
was
,
one
might
,
by
*NL*
extreme
means
,
force
the
mercer
to
open
his
teeth
and
let
his
secret
*NL*
escape
.
The
question
,
then
,
was
how
to
change
this
probability
into
a
*NL*
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
my
dear
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
if
I
do
n't
stand
upon
ceremony
,
''
*NL*
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
but
nothing
makes
one
so
thirsty
as
want
of
sleep
.
I
*NL*
am
parched
with
thirst
.
Allow
me
to
take
a
glass
of
water
in
your
*NL*
apartment
;
you
know
that
is
never
refused
among
neighbors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
the
permission
of
his
host
,
d'Artagnan
went
quickly
*NL*
into
the
house
,
and
cast
a
rapid
glance
at
the
bed
.
It
had
not
been
*NL*
used
.
Bonacieux
had
not
been
abed
.
He
had
only
been
back
an
hour
or
two
;
*NL*
he
had
accompanied
his
wife
to
the
place
of
her
confinement
,
or
else
at
*NL*
least
to
the
first
relay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Monsieur
Bonacieux
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
emptying
his
glass
,
``
that
*NL*
is
all
I
wanted
of
you
.
I
will
now
go
up
into
my
apartment
.
I
will
make
*NL*
Planchet
brush
my
boots
;
and
when
he
has
done
,
I
will
,
if
you
like
,
send
*NL*
him
to
you
to
brush
your
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
mercer
quite
astonished
at
his
singular
farewell
,
and
asking
*NL*
himself
if
he
had
not
been
a
little
inconsiderate
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
found
Planchet
in
a
great
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
!
''
cried
Planchet
,
as
soon
as
he
perceived
his
master
,
*NL*
``
here
is
more
trouble
.
I
thought
you
would
never
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
now
,
Planchet
?
''
demanded
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
give
you
a
hundred
,
I
give
you
a
thousand
times
to
guess

visit
I
received

your
absence

*NL*
*NL*
``
When

About

beg

It
was
called

Palais-Cardinal

Richelieu
gave
it

the
King

``

*NL*

you

physiognomist

I
assure
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
went
out
first
,
as
had
been
agreed
upon
.
Then
,
in
order
that
*NL*
he
might
have
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
,
he
directed
his
steps
,
*NL*
for
the
last
time
,
toward
the
residences
of
his
three
friends
.
No
news
*NL*
had
been
received
of
them
;
only
a
letter
,
all
perfumed
and
of
an
elegant
*NL*
writing
in
small
characters
,
had
come
for
Aramis
.
D'Artagnan
took
charge
*NL*
of
it
.
Ten
minutes
afterward
Planchet
joined
him
at
the
stables
of
the
*NL*
Hotel
des
Gardes
.
D'Artagnan
,
in
order
that
there
might
be
no
time
lost
,
*NL*
had
saddled
his
horse
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
''
said
he
to
Planchet
,
when
the
latter
added
the
*NL*
portmanteau
to
the
equipment
.
``
Now
saddle
the
other
three
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
then
,
monsieur
,
that
we
shall
travel
faster
with
two
*NL*
horses
apiece
?
''
said
Planchet
,
with
his
shrewd
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Monsieur
Jester
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
with
our
four
horses
we
*NL*
may
bring
back
our
three
friends
,
if
we
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
*NL*
find
them
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
a
great
chance

''
replied
Planchet
,
``
but
we
must
not
despair
of
*NL*
the
mercy
of
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
getting
into
his
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
from
the
Hotel
des
Gardes
,
they
separated
,
leaving
the
*NL*
street
at
opposite
ends
,
one
having
to
quit
Paris
by
the
Barriere
de
la
*NL*
Villette
and
the
other
by
the
Barriere
Montmartre
,
to
meet
again
beyond
*NL*
St.
Denis
--
a
strategic
maneuver
which
,
having
been
executed
with
equal
*NL*
punctuality
,
was
crowned
with
the
most
fortunate
results
.
D'Artagnan
and
*NL*
Planchet
entered
Pierrefitte
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
was
more
courageous
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
by
day
than
by
night
.
*NL*
His
natural
prudence
,
however
,
never
forsook
him
for
a
single
instant
.
*NL*
He
had
forgotten
not
one
of
the
incidents
of
the
first
journey
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
upon
everybody
he
met
on
the
road
as
an
enemy
.
It
followed
that
*NL*
his
hat
was
forever
in
his
hand
,
which
procured
him
some
severe
*NL*
reprimands
from
d'Artagnan
,
who
feared
that
his
excess
of
politeness
*NL*
would
lead
people
to
think
he
was
the
lackey
of
a
man
of
no
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
whether
the
passengers
were
really
touched
by
the
urbanity
*NL*
of
Planchet
or
whether
this
time
nobody
was
posted
on
the
young
man
's
*NL*
road
,
our
two
travelers
arrived
at
Chantilly
without
any
accident
,
and
*NL*
alighted
at
the
tavern
of
Great
St.
Martin
,
the
same
at
which
they
had
*NL*
stopped
on
their
first
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
,
on
seeing
a
young
man
followed
by
a
lackey
with
two
extra
*NL*
horses
,
advanced
respectfully
to
the
door
.
Now
,
as
they
had
already
*NL*
traveled
eleven
leagues
,
d'Artagnan
thought
it
time
to
stop
,
whether
*NL*
Porthos
were
or
were
not
in
the
inn
.
Perhaps
it
would
not
be
prudent
to
*NL*
ask
at
once
what
had
become
of
the
Musketeer
.
The
result
of
these
*NL*
reflections
was
that
d'Artagnan
,
without
asking
information
of
any
kind
,
*NL*
alighted
,
commended
the
horses
to
the
care
of
his
lackey
,
entered
a
*NL*
small
room
destined
to
receive
those
who
wished
to
be
alone
,
and
desired
*NL*
the
host
to
bring
him
a
bottle
of
his
best
wine
and
as
good
a
breakfast
*NL*
as
possible
--
a
desire
which
further
corroborated
the
high
opinion
the
*NL*
innkeeper
had
formed
of
the
traveler
at
first
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
therefore
served
with
miraculous
celerity
.
The
regiment
*NL*
of
the
Guards
was
recruited
among
the
first
gentlemen
of
the
kingdom
;
*NL*
and
d'Artagnan
,
followed
by
a
lackey
,
and
traveling
with
four
*NL*
magnificent
horses
,
despite
the
simplicity
of
his
uniform
,
could
not
*NL*
fail
to
make
a
sensation
.
The
host
desired
himself
to
serve
him
;
which
*NL*
d'Artagnan
perceiving
,
ordered
two
glasses
to
be
brought
,
and
commenced
*NL*
the
following
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
my
good
host
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
filling
the
two
glasses
,
``
I
*NL*
asked
for
a
bottle
of
your
best
wine
,
and
if
you
have
deceived
me
,
you
*NL*
will
be
punished
in
what
you
have
sinned
;
for
seeing
that
I
hate
*NL*
drinking
by
myself
,
you
shall
drink
with
me
.
Take
your
glass
,
then
,
and
*NL*
let
us
drink
.
But
what
shall
we
drink
to
,
so
as
to
avoid
wounding
any
*NL*
susceptibility
?
Let
us
drink
to
the
prosperity
of
your
establishment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Lordship
does
me
much
honor
,
''
said
the
host
,
``
and
I
thank
you
*NL*
sincerely
for
your
kind
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
mistake
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
there
is
more
selfishness
in
my
*NL*
toast
than
perhaps
you
may
think
--
for
it
is
only
in
prosperous
*NL*
establishments
that
one
is
well
received
.
In
hotels
that
do
not
*NL*
flourish
,
everything
is
in
confusion
,
and
the
traveler
is
a
victim
to
*NL*
the
embarrassments
of
his
host
.
Now
,
I
travel
a
great
deal
,
particularly
*NL*
on
this
road
,
and
I
wish
to
see
all
innkeepers
making
a
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
said
the
host
,
``
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
I
have
*NL*
had
the
honor
of
seeing
Monsieur

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
I
have
passed
perhaps
ten
times
through
Chantilly
,
and
out
of
the
*NL*
ten
times
I
have
stopped
three
or
four
times
at
your
house
at
least
.
Why
*NL*
I
was
here
only
ten
or
twelve
days
ago
.
I
was
conducting
some
friends
,
*NL*
Musketeers
,
one
of
whom
,
by
the
by
,
had
a
dispute
with
a
stranger
--
a
man
*NL*
who
sought
a
quarrel
with
him
,
for
I
do
n't
know
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so
,
''
said
the
host
;
``
I
remember
it
perfectly
.
It
is
not
*NL*
Monsieur
Porthos
that
your
Lordship
means

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

anything
has
happened
to
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Lordship
must
have
observed
that
he
could
not
continue
his
*NL*
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
he
promised
to
rejoin

we
have
seen
nothing
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
done
us
the
honor
to
remain
here

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

in
this
house

we
are
even
a

uneasy

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
account
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
certain
expenses
he
has
contracted

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

whatever
expenses

may
have
incurred

I
am
sure
he
is
in

pay
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
you
infuse
genuine
balm
into
my
blood

We
have
made
*NL*
considerable
advances
;
and
this
very
morning
the
surgeon
declared
that
*NL*
if
Monsieur
Porthos
did
not
pay
him
,
he
should
look
to
me

as
it

I

better

*NL*
*NL*

Yes

in
our

Take
the
stairs
on
your
right
;
go
up
the
first

flight

knock
at
Number
One
.
Only
warn
him
that
it
is
you

*NL*
*NL*

Why
should
I
do

happen

you

wonder

*NL*
*NL*

Monsieur
Porthos
may
imagine
you
belong

the
house

in
a
fit
of

passion
might
run
his
sword
through
you

blow

I
can
understand
that

It
is
a
demand
that
Porthos
takes
*NL*
very
ill
when
he
is
not
in
funds
;

I
know
he
must
be
so
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
so
,
too
,
monsieur

As
our
house
is
carried
on
very
*NL*
regularly
,
and
we
make
out
our
bills
every
week
,
at
the
end
of
eight
*NL*
days
we
presented
our
account
;
but
it
appeared
we
had
chosen
an
unlucky
*NL*
moment
,
for
at
the
first
word
on
the
subject
,
he
sent
us
to
all
the
*NL*
devils
.
It
is
true
he
had
been
playing
the
day
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Playing
the
day
before
!
And
with
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
who
can
say
,
monsieur
?
With
some
gentleman
who
was
traveling
this
*NL*
way
,
to
whom
he
proposed
a
game
of
LANSQUENET
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
then
,
and
the
foolish
fellow
lost
all
he
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
to
his
horse
,
monsieur
;
for
when
the
gentleman
was
about
to
set
*NL*
out
,
we
perceived
that
his
lackey
was
saddling
Monsieur
Porthos
's
horse
,
*NL*
as
well
as
his
master
's
.
When
we
observed
this
to
him
,
he
told
us
all
to
*NL*
trouble
ourselves
about
our
own
business
,
as
this
horse
belonged
to
him
.
*NL*
We
also
informed
Monsieur
Porthos
of
what
was
going
on
;
but
he
told
us
*NL*
we
were
scoundrels
to
doubt
a
gentleman
's
word
,
and
that
as
he
had
said
*NL*
the
horse
was
his
,
it
must
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Porthos
all
over
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
continued
the
host
,
``
I
replied
that
as
from
the
moment
we
seemed
*NL*
not
likely
to
come
to
a
good
understanding
with
respect
to
payment
,
I
*NL*
hoped
that
he
would
have
at
least
the
kindness
to
grant
the
favor
of
his
*NL*
custom
to
my
brother
host
of
the
Golden
Eagle
;
but
Monsieur
Porthos
*NL*
replied
that
,
my
house
being
the
best
,
he
should
remain
where
he
was
.
*NL*
This
reply
was
too
flattering
to
allow
me
to
insist
on
his
departure
.
I
*NL*
confined
myself
then
to
begging
him
to
give
up
his
chamber
,
which
is
the
*NL*
handsomest
in
the
hotel
,
and
to
be
satisfied
with
a
pretty
little
room
*NL*
on
the
third
floor
;
but
to
this
Monsieur
Porthos
replied
that
as
he
*NL*
every
moment
expected
his
mistress
,
who
was
one
of
the
greatest
ladies
*NL*
in
the
court
,
I
might
easily
comprehend
that
the
chamber
he
did
me
the
*NL*
honor
to
occupy
in
my
house
was
itself
very
mean
for
the
visit
of
such
a
*NL*
personage
.
Nevertheless
,
while
acknowledging
the
truth
of
what
he
said
,
*NL*
I
thought
proper
to
insist
;
but
without
even
giving
himself
the
trouble
*NL*
to
enter
into
any
discussion
with
me
,
he
took
one
of
his
pistols
,
laid
*NL*
it
on
his
table
,
day
and
night
,
and
said
that
at
the
first
word
that
*NL*
should
be
spoken
to
him
about
removing
,
either
within
the
house
or
out
*NL*
of
it
,
he
would
blow
out
the
brains
of
the
person
who
should
be
so
*NL*
imprudent
as
to
meddle
with
a
matter
which
only
concerned
himself
.
Since
*NL*
that
time
,
monsieur
,
nobody
entered
his
chamber
but
his
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Mousqueton
is
here
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
monsieur
.
Five
days
after
your
departure
,
he
came
back
,
and
in
*NL*
a
very
bad
condition
,
too
.
It
appears
that
he
had
met
with
*NL*
disagreeableness
,
likewise
,
on
his
journey
.
Unfortunately
,
he
is
more
*NL*
nimble
than
his
master
;
so
that
for
the
sake
of
his
master
,
he
puts
us
*NL*
all
under
his
feet
,
and
as
he
thinks
we
might
refuse
what
he
asked
for

*NL*
he
takes
all
he
wants
without
asking
at
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is

said
d'Artagnan

always
observed
a
great
degree

of
intelligence

devotedness

``
But
how
do
you
know
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
flew
into
a
great
passion
on
receiving
the
letter
,
saying
*NL*
that
Monsieur
Porthos
was
a
weathercock
,
and
that
she
was
sure
it
was
*NL*
for
some
woman
he
had
received
this
wound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
been
wounded
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
Lord
!
What
have
I
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
that
Porthos
had
received
a
sword
cut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
has
forbidden
me
so
strictly
to
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
,
monsieur
!
Because
he
had
boasted
that
he
would
perforate
the
*NL*
stranger
with
whom
you
left
him
in
dispute
;
whereas
the
stranger
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
in
spite
of
all
his
rodomontades
quickly
threw
him
on
his
*NL*
back
.
As
Monsieur
Porthos
is
a
very
boastful
man
,
he
insists
that
nobody
*NL*
shall
know
he
has
received
this
wound
except
the
duchess
,
whom
he
*NL*
endeavored
to
interest
by
an
account
of
his
adventure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
wound
that
confines
him
to
his
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
a
master
stroke
,
too
,
I
assure
you
.
Your
friend
's
soul
must
*NL*
stick
tight
to
his
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
there
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
followed
them
from
curiosity
,
so
that
I
saw
the
combat
*NL*
without
the
combatants
seeing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
took
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
The
affair
was
not
long
,
I
assure
you
.
They
placed
themselves
on
*NL*
guard
;
the
stranger
made
a
feint
and
a
lunge
,
and
that
so
rapidly
that
*NL*
when
Monsieur
Porthos
came
to
the
PARADE
,
he
had
already
three
inches
of
*NL*
steel
in
his
breast
.
He
immediately
fell
backward
.
The
stranger
placed
*NL*
the
point
of
his
sword
at
his
throat
;
and
Monsieur
Porthos
,
finding
*NL*
himself
at
the
mercy
of
his
adversary
,
acknowledged
himself
conquered
.
*NL*
Upon
which
the
stranger
asked
his
name
,
and
learning
that
it
was
*NL*
Porthos
,
and
not
d'Artagnan
,
he
assisted
him
to
rise
,
brought
him
back
*NL*
to
the
hotel
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
disappeared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
with
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
this
stranger
meant
to
quarrel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
never
saw
him
until
that
moment
,

have
not
seen
him
since

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
know
all
that
I
wish
to
know

Porthos

on
the
first
story

Number
One

''
*NL*
*NL*

Yes

handsomest

could
have

let
ten
times
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
Be
satisfied

said
d'Artagnan
,
laughing
,
``
Porthos
will
pay
you

with

money
of

Duchess
Coquenard

*NL*

monsieur

she
will

loosen
her

it
will
be
all
the
same
;
but
she
positively
answered
that
*NL*
she
was
tired
of
the
exigencies
and
infidelities
of
Monsieur
Porthos
,
*NL*
and
that
she
would
not
send
him

denier

*NL*

did
you
convey
this
answer

your
guest

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
took
good
care
not
to
do

would
have
found

we
had
executed

commission

*NL*
*NL*

So

still
expects

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

Yesterday
he
wrote
again

was
his

time
put
the
letter
in
the
post

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

``
Fifty

*NL*
*NL*
``
In

may
be
quite
at

can
not
owe

much

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

not
much

Twenty
good
pistoles

already

without
reckoning

He

nothing

may
easily
be

Never

So

my

be
not
uneasy

continue
to
take
all

the
care
of
him
that
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
Saying
these
words
,
d'Artagnan
went
upstairs
,
leaving
his
host
a
little
*NL*
better
satisfied
with
respect
to
two
things
in
which
he
appeared
to
be
*NL*
very
much
interested
--
his
debt
and
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
upon
the
most
conspicuous
door
of
the
*NL*
corridor
,
was
traced
in
black
ink
a
gigantic
number
``
1
.
''
d'Artagnan
*NL*
knocked
,
and
upon
the
bidding
to
come
in
which
came
from
inside
,
he
*NL*
entered
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
was
in
bed
,
and
was
playing
a
game
at
LANSQUENET
with
*NL*
Mousqueton
,
to
keep
his
hand
in
;
while
a
spit
loaded
with
partridges
was
*NL*
turning
before
the
fire
,
and
on
each
side
of
a
large
chimneypiece
,
over
*NL*
two
chafing
dishes
,
were
boiling
two
stewpans
,
from
which
exhaled
a
*NL*
double
odor
of
rabbit
and
fish
stews
,
rejoicing
to
the
smell
.
In
*NL*
addition
to
this
he
perceived
that
the
top
of
a
wardrobe
and
the
marble
*NL*
of
a
commode
were
covered
with
empty
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
his
friend
,
Porthos
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
joy
;
and
*NL*
Mousqueton
,
rising
respectfully
,
yielded
his
place
to
him
,
and
went
to
*NL*
give
an
eye
to
the
two
stewpans
,
of
which
he
appeared
to
have
the
*NL*
particular
inspection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
PARDIEU
!
Is
that
you
?
''
said
Porthos
to
d'Artagnan
.
``
You
are
right
*NL*
welcome
.
Excuse
my
not
coming
to
meet
you
;
but
,
''
added
he
,
looking
at
*NL*
d'Artagnan
with
a
certain
degree
of
uneasiness
,
``
you
know
what
has
*NL*
happened
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
host
told
you
nothing
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
after
you
,
and
came
up
as
soon
as
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
seemed
to
breathe
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
happened
to
you
,
my
dear
Porthos
?
''
continued
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
on
making
a
thrust
at
my
adversary
,
whom
I
had
already
hit
three
*NL*
times
,
and
whom
I
meant
to
finish
with
the
fourth
,
I
put
my
foot
on
a
*NL*
stone
,
slipped
,
and
strained
my
knee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honor

Luckily
for
the
rascal

left

dead
on

spot

I
assure
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
became
of
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
do
n't
know

he
had
enough
,
and
set
off
without
waiting
for
the
*NL*
rest
.
But
you

my
dear
d'Artagnan

what
has
happened
to
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
this
strain
of
the
knee
,

continued
d'Artagnan
,
``
my
dear
*NL*
Porthos

keeps
you
in
bed

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God

that
's
all

shall
be
about
again
in
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
have
yourself
conveyed
to
Paris
?
You
must
be
cruelly
*NL*
bored
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
my
intention
;
but
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
have
one
thing
to
confess
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
that
as
I
was
cruelly
bored
,
as
you
say
,
and
as
I
had
the
*NL*
seventy-five
pistoles
in
my
pocket
which
you
had
distributed
to
me
,
in
*NL*
order
to
amuse
myself
I
invited
a
gentleman
who
was
traveling
this
way
*NL*
to
walk
up
,
and
proposed
a
cast
of
dice
.
He
accepted
my
challenge
,
and
,
*NL*
my
faith
,
my
seventy-five
pistoles
passed
from
my
pocket
to
his
,
without
*NL*
reckoning
my
horse
,
which
he
won
into
the
bargain
.
But
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
d'Artagnan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
expect
,
my
dear
Porthos
;
a
man
is
not
privileged
in
all
*NL*
ways

said
d'Artagnan
.
``
You
know
the
proverb

Unlucky
at
play

lucky

love

You
are
too
fortunate

your
love
for
play
not

take
its
*NL*
revenge

What
consequence
can
the
reverses
of
fortune
be
to
you
?
Have
*NL*
you
not

happy
rogue

you
are

you

can
not

come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
see

my
dear
d'Artagnan

what
ill
luck
I
play

replied
*NL*
Porthos
,
with
the
most
careless
air
in
the
world
.
``
I
wrote
to
her
to
*NL*
send
me
fifty
louis
or
so
,
of
which
I
stood
absolutely
in
need

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*

Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

so
I
yesterday
addressed
another
epistle

her

still
more
*NL*
pressing
than
the
first
.
But
you
are
here
,
my
dear
fellow
,
let
us
speak
*NL*
of
you
.
I
confess
I
began
to
be
very
uneasy
on
your
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
host
behaves
very
well
toward
you
,
as
it
appears
,
my
dear
*NL*
Porthos

said
d'Artagnan
,
directing
the
sick
man
's
attention
to
the
*NL*
full
stewpans
and
the
empty
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
so
,
''
replied
Porthos
.
``
Only
three
or
four
days
ago
the
impertinent
*NL*
jackanapes
gave
me
his
bill
,
and
I
was
forced
to
turn
both
him
and
his
*NL*
bill
out
of
the
door
;
so
that
I
am
here
something
in
the
fashion
of
a
*NL*
conqueror
,
holding
my
position
,
as
it
were
,
my
conquest
.
So
you
see
,
*NL*
being
in
constant
fear
of
being
forced
from
that
position
,
I
am
armed
to
*NL*
the
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
laughing
,
``
it
appears
to
me
that
from
time
*NL*
to
time
you
must
make
SORTIES

And
he
again
pointed
to
the
bottles
and
*NL*
the
stewpans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
unfortunately
!
''
said
Porthos
.
``
This
miserable
strain
confines
me
*NL*

my
bed

but
Mousqueton
forages

brings
in
provisions

Friend
*NL*
Mousqueton
,
you
see

we
must
have

increase

*NL*
*NL*
``

not
be
sorry

be
able

let

advantages
with

you
gratify

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
monsieur
!
There
is
nothing
more
easy

''
said
Mousqueton
,
with
a
*NL*
modest
air
.
``
One
only
needs
to
be
sharp
,
that
's
all
.
I
was
brought
up
in
*NL*
the
country
,
and
my
father
in
his
leisure
time
was
something
of
a
*NL*
poacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
do
the
rest
of
his
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
he
carried
on
a
trade
which
I
have
always
thought
*NL*
satisfactory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
it
was
a
time
of
war
between
the
Catholics
and
the
Huguenots
,
and
as
*NL*
he
saw
the
Catholics
exterminate
the
Huguenots
and
the
Huguenots
*NL*
exterminate
the
Catholics
--
all
in
the
name
of
religion
--
he
adopted
a
*NL*
mixed
belief
which
permitted
him
to
be
sometimes
Catholic
,
sometimes
a
*NL*
Huguenot
.
Now
,
he
was
accustomed
to
walk
with
his
fowling
piece
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
behind
the
hedges
which
border
the
roads
,
and
when
he
saw
a
*NL*
Catholic
coming
alone
,
the
Protestant
religion
immediately
prevailed
in
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
lowered
his
gun
in
the
direction
of
the
traveler
;
then
,
*NL*
when
he
was
within
ten
paces
of
him
,
he
commenced
a
conversation
which
*NL*
almost
always
ended
by
the
traveler
's
abandoning
his
purse
to
save
his
*NL*
life
.
It
goes
without
saying
that
when
he
saw
a
Huguenot
coming
,
he
felt
*NL*
himself
filled
with
such
ardent
Catholic
zeal
that
he
could
not
*NL*
understand
how
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
,
he
had
been
able
to
have
*NL*
any
doubts
upon
the
superiority
of
our
holy
religion
.
For
my
part
,
*NL*
monsieur
,
I
am
Catholic
--
my
father
,
faithful
to
his
principles
,
having
*NL*
made
my
elder
brother
a
Huguenot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
the
end
of
this
worthy
man
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
the
most
unfortunate
kind
,
monsieur
.
One
day
he
was
surprised
in
*NL*
a
lonely
road
between
a
Huguenot
and
a
Catholic
,
with
both
of
whom
he
*NL*
had
before
had
business
,
and
who
both
knew
him
again
;
so
they
united
*NL*
against
him
and
hanged
him
on
a
tree
.
Then
they
came
and
boasted
of
*NL*
their
fine
exploit
in
the
cabaret
of
the
next
village
,
where
my
brother
*NL*
and
I
were
drinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
you
do
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
let
them
tell
their
story
out
,
''
replied
Mousqueton
.
``
Then
,
as
in
*NL*
leaving
the
cabaret
they
took
different
directions
,
my
brother
went
and
*NL*
hid
himself
on
the
road
of
the
Catholic
,
and
I
on
that
of
the
Huguenot
.
*NL*
Two
hours
after
,
all
was
over
;
we
had
done
the
business
of
both
,
*NL*
admiring
the
foresight
of
our
poor
father
,
who
had
taken
the
precaution
*NL*
to
bring
each
of
us
up
in
a
different
religion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
allow
,
as
you
say
,
your
father
was
a
very
intelligent
*NL*
fellow
.
And
you
say
in
his
leisure
moments
the
worthy
man
was
a
*NL*
poacher
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
and
it
was
he
who
taught
me
to
lay
a
snare
and
ground
a
*NL*
line
.
The
consequence
is
that
when
I
saw
our
laborers
,
which
did
not
at
*NL*
all
suit
two
such
delicate
stomachs
as
ours
,
I
had
recourse
to
a
little
*NL*
of
my
old
trade
.
While
walking
near
the
wood
of
Monsieur
le
Prince
,
I
*NL*
laid
a
few
snare
in
the
runs
;
and
while
reclining
on
the
banks
of
his
*NL*
Highness
's
pieces
of
water
,
I
slipped
a
few
lines
into
his
fish
ponds
.
*NL*
So
that
now
,
thanks
be
to
God
,
we
do
not
want
,
as
Monsieur
can
testify
,
*NL*
for
partridges
,
rabbits
,
carp
or
eels
--
all
light
,
wholesome
food
,
*NL*
suitable
for
the
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
wine
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
who
furnishes
the
wine
?
Your
host
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
yes
and
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
yes
and
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
furnishes
it
,
it
is
true
,
but
he
does
not
know
that
he
has
that

honor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
yourself
,
Mousqueton

your
conversation
is
full
of
instructive
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
,
monsieur
.
It
has
so
chanced
that
I
met
with
a
Spaniard
in
*NL*
my
peregrinations
who
had
seen
many
countries
,
and
among
them
the
New
*NL*
World
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
connection
can
the
New
World
have
with
the
bottles
which
are
on
*NL*
the
commode
and
the
wardrobe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience
,
monsieur
,
everything
will
come
in
its
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Spaniard
had
in
his
service
a
lackey
who
had
accompanied
him
in
*NL*
his
voyage
to
Mexico
.
This
lackey
was
my
compatriot
;
and
we
became
the
*NL*
more
intimate
from
there
being
many
resemblances
of
character
between
*NL*
us
.
We
loved
sporting
of
all
kinds
better
than
anything
;
so
that
he
*NL*
related
to
me
how
in
the
plains
of
the
Pampas
the
natives
hunt
the
tiger
*NL*
and
the
wild
bull
with
simple
running
nooses
which
they
throw
to
a
*NL*
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
paces
the
end
of
a
cord
with
such
nicety
;
*NL*
but
in
face
of
the
proof
I
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
*NL*
recital
.
My
friend
placed
a
bottle
at
the
distance
of
thirty
paces
,
and
*NL*
at
each
cast
he
caught
the
neck
of
the
bottle
in
his
running
noose
.
I
*NL*
practiced
this
exercise
,
and
as
nature
has
endowed
me
with
some
*NL*
faculties
,
at
this
day
I
can
throw
the
lasso
with
any
man
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Well
,
do
you
understand
,
monsieur
?
Our
host
has
a
well-furnished
cellar
*NL*
the
key
of
which
never
leaves
him
;
only
this
cellar
has
a
ventilating
*NL*
hole
.
Now
through
this
ventilating
hole
I
throw
my
lasso
,
and
as
I
now
*NL*
know
in
which
part
of
the
cellar
is
the
best
wine
,
that
's
my
point
for
*NL*
sport
.
You
see
,
monsieur
,
what
the
New
World
has
to
do
with
the
bottles
*NL*
which
are
on
the
commode
and
the
wardrobe
.
Now
,
will
you
taste
our
wine
,
*NL*
and
without
prejudice
say
what
you
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
friend
,
thank
you
;
unfortunately
,
I
have
just
*NL*
breakfasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
arrange
the
table
,
Mousqueton
,
and
while
we
*NL*
breakfast
,
d'Artagnan
will
relate
to
us
what
has
happened
to
him
during
*NL*
the
ten
days
since
he
left
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Porthos
and
Mousqueton
were
breakfasting
,
with
the
appetites
of
*NL*
convalescents
and
with
that
brotherly
cordiality
which
unites
men
in
*NL*
misfortune
,
d'Artagnan
related
how
Aramis
,
being
wounded
,
was
obliged
to
*NL*
stop
at
Crevecoeur
,
how
he
had
left
Athos
fighting
at
Amiens
with
four
*NL*
men
who
accused
him
of
being
a
coiner
,
and
how
he
,
d'Artagnan
,
had
been
*NL*
forced
to
run
the
Comtes
de
Wardes
through
the
body
in
order
to
reach
*NL*
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
the
confidence
of
d'Artagnan
stopped
.
He
only
added
that
on
*NL*
his
return
from
Great
Britain
he
had
brought
back
four
magnificent
*NL*
horses
--
one
for
himself
,
and
one
for
each
of
his
companions
;
then
he
*NL*
informed
Porthos
that
the
one
intended
for
him
was
already
installed
in
*NL*
the
stable
of
the
tavern
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Planchet
entered
,
to
inform
his
master
that
the
horses
*NL*
were
sufficiently
refreshed
and
that
it
would
be
possible
to
sleep
at
*NL*
Clermont
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
d'Artagnan
was
tolerably
reassured
with
regard
to
Porthos
,
and
as
he
*NL*
was
anxious
to
obtain
news
of
his
two
other
friends
,
he
held
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
the
wounded
man
,
and
told
him
he
was
about
to
resume
his
route
*NL*
in
order
to
continue
his
researches
.
For
the
rest
,
as
he
reckoned
upon
*NL*
returning
by
the
same
route
in
seven
or
eight
days
,
if
Porthos
were
*NL*
still
at
the
Great
St.
Martin
,
he
would
call
for
him
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
replied
that
in
all
probability
his
sprain
would
not
permit
him
*NL*
to
depart
yet
awhile
.
Besides
,
it
was
necessary
he
should
stay
at
*NL*
Chantilly
to
wait
for
the
answer
from
his
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
wished
that
answer
might
be
prompt
and
favorable
;
and
having
*NL*
again
recommended
Porthos
to
the
care
of
Mousqueton
,
and
paid
his
bill
*NL*
to
the
host
,
he
resumed
his
route
with
Planchet
,
already
relieved
of
one
*NL*
of
his
led
horses
.

ARAMIS
AND
HIS
THESIS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
said
nothing
to
Porthos
of
his
wound
or
of
his
*NL*
procurator
's
wife
.
Our
Bearnais
was
a
prudent
lad
,
however
young
he
*NL*
might
be
.
Consequently
he
had
appeared
to
believe
all
that
the
*NL*
vainglorious
Musketeer
had
told
him
,
convinced
that
no
friendship
will
*NL*
hold
out
against
a
surprised
secret
.
Besides
,
we
feel
always
a
sort
of
*NL*
mental
superiority
over
those
whose
lives
we
know
better
than
they
*NL*
suppose
.
In
his
projects
of
intrigue
for
the
future
,
and
determined
as
*NL*
he
was
to
make
his
three
friends
the
instruments
of
his
fortune
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
was
not
sorry
at
getting
into
his
grasp
beforehand
the
*NL*
invisible
strings
by
which
he
reckoned
upon
moving
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
as
he
journeyed
along
,
a
profound
sadness
weighed
upon
his
*NL*
heart
.
He
thought
of
that
young
and
pretty
Mme.
Bonacieux
who
was
to
*NL*
have
paid
him
the
price
of
his
devotedness
;
but
let
us
hasten
to
say
*NL*
that
this
sadness
possessed
the
young
man
less
from
the
regret
of
the
*NL*
happiness
he
had
missed
,
than
from
the
fear
he
entertained
that
some
*NL*
serious
misfortune
had
befallen
the
poor
woman
.
For
himself
,
he
had
no
*NL*
doubt
she
was
a
victim
of
the
cardinal
's
vengeance
;
and
,
as
was
well
*NL*
known
,
the
vengeance
of
his
Eminence
was
terrible
.
How
he
had
found
*NL*
grace
in
the
eyes
of
the
minister
,
he
did
not
know
;
but
without
doubt
M.
*NL*
de
Cavois
would
have
revealed
this
to
him
if
the
captain
of
the
Guards
*NL*
had
found
him
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
makes
time
pass
more
quickly
or
more
shortens
a
journey
than
a
*NL*
thought
which
absorbs
in
itself
all
the
faculties
of
the
organization
of
*NL*
him
who
thinks
.
External
existence
then
resembles
a
sleep
of
which
this
*NL*
thought
is
the
dream
.
By
its
influence
,
time
has
no
longer
measure
,
*NL*
space
has
no
longer
distance
.
We
depart
from
one
place
,
and
arrive
at
*NL*
another
,
that
is
all
.
Of
the
interval
passed
,
nothing
remains
in
the
*NL*
memory
but
a
vague
mist
in
which
a
thousand
confused
images
of
trees
,
*NL*
mountains
,
and
landscapes
are
lost
.
It
was
as
a
prey
to
this
*NL*
hallucination
that
d'Artagnan
traveled
,
at
whatever
pace
his
horse
*NL*
pleased
,
the
six
or
eight
leagues
that
separated
Chantilly
from
*NL*
Crevecoeur
,
without
his
being
able
to
remember
on
his
arrival
in
the
*NL*
village
any
of
the
things
he
had
passed
or
met
with
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
only
his
memory
returned
to
him
.
He
shook
his
head
,
perceived
the
*NL*
cabaret
at
which
he
had
left
Aramis
,
and
putting
his
horse
to
the
trot
,
*NL*
he
shortly
pulled
up
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
it
was
not
a
host
but
a
hostess
who
received
him
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
was
a
physiognomist
.
His
eye
took
in
at
a
glance
the
plump
,
cheerful
*NL*
countenance
of
the
mistress
of
the
place
,
and
he
at
once
perceived
there
*NL*
was
no
occasion
for
dissembling
with
her
,
or
of
fearing
anything
from
*NL*
one
blessed
with
such
a
joyous
physiognomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
dame
,
''
asked
d'Artagnan
,
``
can
you
tell
me
what
has
become
of
*NL*
one
of
my
friends
,
whom
we
were
obliged
to
leave
here
about
a
dozen
days
*NL*
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
handsome
young
man

three
-
or
four-and-twenty
years
old

well
made

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is

wounded
in
the
shoulder

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so

Well

is
still
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
PARDIEU
!
My
dear
dame

''
said
d'Artagnan
,
springing
from
his
horse
,
*NL*
and
throwing
the
bridle
to
Planchet
,
``
you
restore
me
to
life

where

Aramis

Let

in
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
monsieur
,
but
I
doubt
whether
he
can
see
you
at
this
moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
Has
he
a
lady
with
him
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
!
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
Poor
lad
!
No

monsieur
,

has
not
a

lady
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
whom
is
he
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
curate
of
Montdidier
and
the
superior
of
the
Jesuits
of
*NL*
Amiens

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
is
the
poor
fellow
worse
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

monsieur
,
quite
the
contrary
;
but
after
his
illness
grace
touched
*NL*
him
,
and
he
determined
to
take
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
had
forgotten
that
he
was
only
a
*NL*
Musketeer
for
a
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
still
insists
upon
seeing
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
monsieur
has
only
to
take
the
right-hand
staircase
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
,
and
knock
at
Number
Five
on
the
second
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
walked
quickly
in
the
direction
indicated
,
and
found
one
of
*NL*
those
exterior
staircases
that
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
yards
of
our
*NL*
old-fashioned
taverns
.
But
there
was
no
getting
at
the
place
of
sojourn
*NL*
of
the
future
abbe
;
the
defiles
of
the
chamber
of
Aramis
were
as
well
*NL*
guarded
as
the
gardens
of
Armida
.
Bazin
was
stationed
in
the
corridor
,
*NL*
and
barred
his
passage
with
the
more
intrepidity
that
,
after
many
years
*NL*
of
trial
,
Bazin
found
himself
near
a
result
of
which
he
had
ever
been
*NL*
ambitious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
dream
of
poor
Bazin
had
always
been
to
serve
a
churchman
;
*NL*
and
he
awaited
with
impatience
the
moment
,
always
in
the
future
,
when
*NL*
Aramis
would
throw
aside
the
uniform
and
assume
the
cassock
.
The
*NL*
daily-renewed
promise
of
the
young
man
that
the
moment
would
not
long
be
*NL*
delayed
,
had
alone
kept
him
in
the
service
of
a
Musketeer
--
a
service
in
*NL*
which
,
he
said
,
his
soul
was
in
constant
jeopardy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
was
then
at
the
height
of
joy
.
In
all
probability
,
this
time
his
*NL*
master
would
not
retract
.
The
union
of
physical
pain
with
moral
*NL*
uneasiness
had
produced
the
effect
so
long
desired
.
Aramis
,
suffering
at
*NL*
once
in
body
and
mind
,
had
at
length
fixed
his
eyes
and
his
thoughts
*NL*
upon
religion
,
and
he
had
considered
as
a
warning
from
heaven
the
double
*NL*
accident
which
had
happened
to
him
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
sudden
*NL*
disappearance
of
his
mistress
and
the
wound
in
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
easily
understood
that
in
the
present
disposition
of
his
*NL*
master
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
to
Bazin
than
the
arrival
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
which
might
cast
his
master
back
again
into
that
vortex
of
*NL*
mundane
affairs
which
had
so
long
carried
him
away
.
He
resolved
,
then
,
*NL*
to
defend
the
door
bravely
;
and
as
,
betrayed
by
the
mistress
of
the
inn
,
*NL*
he
could
not
say
that
Aramis
was
absent
,
he
endeavored
to
prove
to
the
*NL*
newcomer
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
indiscretion
to
disturb
his
*NL*
master
in
his
pious
conference
,
which
had
commenced
with
the
morning
and
*NL*
would
not
,
as
Bazin
said
,
terminate
before
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
took
very
little
heed
of
the
eloquent
discourse
of
M.
*NL*
Bazin
;
and
as
he
had
no
desire
to
support
a
polemic
discussion
with
his
*NL*
friend
's
valet
,
he
simply
moved
him
out
of
the
way
with
one
hand
,
and
*NL*
with
the
other
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
of
Number
Five
.
The
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
d'Artagnan
went
into
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
in
a
black
gown
,
his
head
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
round
flat
cap
,
*NL*
not
much
unlike
a
CALOTTE
,
was
seated
before
an
oblong
table
,
covered
*NL*
with
rolls
of
paper
and
enormous
volumes
in
folio
.
At
his
right
hand
was
*NL*
placed
the
superior
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
on
his
left
the
curate
of
*NL*
Montdidier
.
The
curtains
were
half
drawn
,
and
only
admitted
the
*NL*
mysterious
light
calculated
for
beatific
reveries
.
All
the
mundane
*NL*
objects
that
generally
strike
the
eye
on
entering
the
room
of
a
young
*NL*
man
,
particularly
when
that
young
man
is
a
Musketeer
,
had
disappeared
as
*NL*
if
by
enchantment
;
and
for
fear
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
sight
of
them
might
*NL*
bring
his
master
back
to
ideas
of
this
world
,
Bazin
had
laid
his
hands
*NL*
upon
sword
,
pistols
,
plumed
hat
,
and
embroideries
and
laces
of
all
kinds
*NL*
and
sorts
.
In
their
stead
d'Artagnan
thought
he
perceived
in
an
obscure
*NL*
corner
a
discipline
cord
suspended
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
noise
made
by
d'Artagnan
in
entering
,
Aramis
lifted
up
his
head
,
*NL*
and
beheld
his
friend
;
but
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
young
man
,
*NL*
the
sight
of
him
did
not
produce
much
effect
upon
the
Musketeer
,
so
*NL*
completely
was
his
mind
detached
from
the
things
of
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
dear
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Aramis
;
``
believe
me
,
I
am
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
delighted
to
see
you
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
although
I
am
not
yet
*NL*
sure
that
it
is
Aramis
I
am
speaking
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
himself
,
my
friend
,
to
himself
!
But
what
makes
you
doubt
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
I
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
chamber
,
and
that
I
had
found
*NL*
my
way
into
the
apartment
of
some
churchman
.
Then
another
error
seized
*NL*
me
on
seeing
you
in
company
with
these
gentlemen
--
I
was
afraid
you
were
*NL*
dangerously
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
in
black
,
who
guessed
d'Artagnan
's
meaning
,
darted
at
him
a
*NL*
glance
which
might
have
been
thought
threatening
;
but
d'Artagnan
took
no
*NL*
heed
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
disturb
you
,
perhaps
,
my
dear
Aramis
,
''
continued
d'Artagnan
,
``
for
by
*NL*
what
I
see
,
I
am
led
to
believe
that
you
are
confessing
to
these
*NL*
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
colored
imperceptibly
.
``
You
disturb
me
?
Oh
,
quite
the
contrary
,
*NL*
dear
friend
,
I
swear
;
and
as
a
proof
of
what
I
say
,
permit
me
to
declare
*NL*
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
safe
and
sound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
he
'll
come
round
,
''
thought
d'Artagnan
;
``
that
's
not
bad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
gentleman
,
who
is
my
friend
,
has
just
escaped
from
a
serious
*NL*
danger
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
with
unction
,
pointing
to
d'Artagnan
with
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
addressing
the
two
ecclesiastics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Praise
God
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
they
,
bowing
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
failed
to
do
so
,
your
Reverences
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
*NL*
returning
their
salutation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
arrive
in
good
time
,
dear
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
and
by
taking
*NL*
part
in
our
discussion
may
assist
us
with
your
intelligence

Monsieur
*NL*
the
Principal
of
Amiens
,
Monsieur
the
Curate
of
Montdidier
,
and
I
are
*NL*
arguing
certain
theological
questions
in
which
we
have
been
much
*NL*
interested
;
I
shall
be
delighted
to
have
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
opinion
of
a
swordsman
can
have
very
little
weight
,
''
replied
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
began
to
be
uneasy
at
the
turn
things
were
taking
,
``
and
*NL*
you
had
better
be
satisfied
,
believe
me
,
with
the
knowledge
of
these

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
in
black
bowed
in
their
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
replied
Aramis
,
``
your
opinion
will
be
very
valuable
.
*NL*
The
question
is
this
:
Monsieur
the
Principal
thinks
that
my
thesis
ought
*NL*
to
be
dogmatic
and
didactic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
thesis
!
Are
you
then
making
a
thesis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
,
''
replied
the
Jesuit
.
``
In
the
examination
which
precedes
*NL*
ordination
,
a
thesis
is
always
a
requisite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ordination
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
who
could
not
believe
what
the
hostess
*NL*
and
Bazin
had
successively
told
him
;
and
he
gazed
,
half
stupefied
,
upon
*NL*
the
three
persons
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
taking
the
same
graceful
position
in
his
easy
*NL*
chair
that
he
would
have
assumed
in
bed
,
and
complacently
examining
his
*NL*
hand
,
which
was
as
white
and
plump
as
that
of
a
woman
,
and
which
he
held
*NL*
in
the
air
to
cause
the
blood
to
descend
,
``
now
,
as
you
have
heard
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
Monsieur
the
Principal
is
desirous
that
my
thesis
should
be
*NL*
dogmatic
,
while
I
,
for
my
part
,
would
rather
it
should
be
ideal
.
This
is
*NL*
the
reason
why
Monsieur
the
Principal
has
proposed
to
me
the
following
*NL*
subject
,
which
has
not
yet
been
treated
upon
,
and
in
which
I
perceive
*NL*
there
is
matter
for
magnificent
elaboration

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
whose
erudition
we
are
well
acquainted
with
,
evinced
no
more
*NL*
interest
on
hearing
this
quotation
than
he
had
at
that
of
M.
de
Treville
*NL*
in
allusion
to
the
gifts
he
pretended
that
d'Artagnan
had
received
from
*NL*
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
,
''
resumed
Aramis
,
that
he
might
perfectly
understand
,
''
`
The
*NL*
two
hands

indispensable
for
priests

they
bestow

*NL*
*NL*
``
An

cried
the
Jesuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admirable

dogmatic
!
''
repeated
the
curate
,
who
,
about
as
strong
as
*NL*
d'Artagnan
with
respect
to
Latin
,
carefully
watched
the
Jesuit
in
order
*NL*
to
keep
step
with
him
,
and
repeated
his
words
like
an
echo
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
he
remained
perfectly
insensible
to
the
enthusiasm
of
*NL*
the
two
men
in
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
admirable
!
PRORSUS

''
continued
Aramis
;
``
but
which
*NL*
requires
a
profound
study
of
both
the

Now
,
I

have
confessed
to
these
learned
ecclesiastics
,
and
that
in
all
humility
,
*NL*
that
the
duties
of
mounting
guard
and
the
service

morals
are
to

metaphysics
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
began
to
be
tired
,
and
so
did
the
curate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
an
exordium
!

cried
the
Jesuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

saying
something

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
cast
a
glance
upon
d'Artagnan
to
see
what
effect
all
this
*NL*
produced
,
and
found
his
friend
gaping
enough
to
split
his
jaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

speak
French

he
to
the

*NL*
``

d'Artagnan
;
``
I
am
fatigued

all
this
*NL*
Latin
confuses
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

replied
the
Jesuit
,
a
little
put
out
,
while
the
curate
,
*NL*
greatly
delighted
,
turned
upon
d'Artagnan
a
look
full
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
``
Well

let
us
see
what
is

Moses

the

servant

was

a
servant

held
out
both
his
arms
while
the
Hebrews
beat
their

enemies

then
he
blessed
them
with
his
two
hands

Besides

what
does
*NL*
the
Gospel
say

*NL*

repeated
the

with
a
gesture

*NL*
``

All
crossed
themselves

follow
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Pope

ecclesiastical
hierarchy

clerks

continued
the
*NL*
Jesuit
;
and
in
his
enthusiasm
he
struck
a
St.
Chrysostom
in
folio
,
which
*NL*
made
the
table
bend
beneath
its
weight

*NL*
D'Artagnan
trembled

overwhelming

there

amazed

poured
upon
his
head

will
you
prove

without
allowing
him
time
to
*NL*
speak

*NL*
D'Artagnan
felt
himself
bewildered

It
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
were
*NL*
in
a
madhouse
,
and
was
becoming
as
mad
as
those
he
saw
.
He
was
,
however
,
*NL*
forced
to
hold
his
tongue
from
not
comprehending
half
the
language
they
*NL*
employed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
listen
to
me

then
,

resumed
Aramis
with
politeness
mingled
with
a
*NL*
little
impatience
.
``
I
do
not
say
I
regret

no

I
will
never
pronounce
*NL*
that
sentence
,
which

orthodox

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jesuit
raised
his
hands
toward
heaven
,
and
the
curate
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

pray
grant
me
that
it
is
acting
with
an
ill

that
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think

he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jesuit
and
the
curate
quite
started
from
their
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the

with
a
little
look
of
diffidence

,
*NL*
however

was
not
exempt
from
a
shade
of
hypocrisy

D'Artagnan

for

The
two

in

rose

bowed
to

advanced
*NL*
toward
the
door

Bazin
,
who
had
been
standing
listening
to
all
this

controversy
with
a
pious
jubilation
,
sprang
toward
them

took
the
*NL*
breviary
of
the

the
missal
of
the
Jesuit

walked

respectfully

them

up

confusion

first
kept
an
embarrassed
silence

It

became
necessary
for
one

it
first

d'Artagnan
appeared

I
had
been
at
the
seminary
from
nine
years
old
;
in
three
days
I
should
*NL*
have
been
twenty
.
I
was
about
to
become
an
abbe
,
and
all
was
arranged
.
*NL*
One
evening
I
went
,
according
to
custom
,
to
a
house
which
I
frequented
*NL*
with
much
pleasure
:
when
one
is
young
,
what
can
be
expected
?
--
one
is
*NL*
weak
.
An
officer
who
saw
me
,
with
a
jealous
eye
,
reading
the
LIVES
OF
*NL*
THE
SAINTS
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
entered
suddenly
and
without
*NL*
being
announced
.
That
evening
I
had
translated
an
episode
of
Judith
,
and
*NL*
had
just
communicated
my
verses
to
the
lady
,
who
gave
me
all
sorts
of
*NL*
compliments
,
and
leaning
on
my
shoulder
,
was
reading
them
a
second
time
*NL*
with
me
.
Her
pose
,
which
I
must
admit
was
rather
free
,
wounded
this
*NL*
officer
.
He
said
nothing
;
but
when
I
went
out
he
followed
,
and
quickly
*NL*
came
up
with
me
.
`
Monsieur
the
Abbe
,
'
said
he
,
`
do
you
like
blows
with
a
*NL*
cane
?
'
'
I
can
not
say
,
monsieur
,
'
answered
I
;
`
no
one
has
ever
dared
to
*NL*
give
me
any
.
'
`
Well
,
listen
to
me
,
then
,
Monsieur
the
Abbe
!
If
you
*NL*
venture
again
into
the
house
in
which
I
have
met
you
this
evening
,
I
*NL*
will
dare
it
myself
.
'
I
really
think
I
must
have
been
frightened
.
I
*NL*
became
very
pale
;
I
felt
my
legs
fail
me
;
I
sought
for
a
reply
,
but
*NL*
could
find
none
--
I
was
silent
.
The
officer
waited
for
his
reply
,
and
*NL*
seeing
it
so
long
coming
,
he
burst
into
a
laugh
,
turned
upon
his
heel
,
*NL*
and
re-entered
the
house
.
I
returned
to
the
seminary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
gentleman
born
,
and
my
blood
is
warm
,
as
you
may
have
remarked
,
*NL*
my
dear
d'Artagnan
.
The
insult
was
terrible
,
and
although
unknown
to
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
world
,
I
felt
it
live
and
fester
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
.
*NL*
I
informed
my
superiors
that
I
did
not
feel
myself
sufficiently
prepared
*NL*
for
ordination
,
and
at
my
request
the
ceremony
was
postponed
for
a
year
.
*NL*
I
sought
out
the
best
fencing
master
in
Paris
,
I
made
an
agreement
with
*NL*
him
to
take
a
lesson
every
day
,
and
every
day
for
a
year
I
took
that
*NL*
lesson
.
Then
,
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
I
had
been
*NL*
insulted
,
I
hung
my
cassock
on
a
peg
,
assumed
the
costume
of
a
cavalier
,
*NL*
and
went
to
a
ball
given
by
a
lady
friend
of
mine
and
to
which
I
knew
my
*NL*
man
was
invited
.
It
was
in
the
Rue
des
France-Bourgeois
,
close
to
La
*NL*
Force
.
As
I
expected
,
my
officer
was
there
.
I
went
up
to
him
as
he
was
*NL*
singing
a
love
ditty
and
looking
tenderly
at
a
lady
,
and
interrupted
him
*NL*
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
second
couplet
.
`
Monsieur
,
'
said
I
,
`
does
*NL*
it
still
displease
you
that
I
should
frequent
a
certain
house
of
La
Rue
*NL*
Payenne
?
And
would
you
still
cane
me
if
I
took
it
into
my
head
to
*NL*
disobey
you
?
The
officer
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
,
and
then
said
,
*NL*
`
What
is
your
business
with
me
,
monsieur
?
I
do
not
know
you
.
'
'
I
am

*NL*
said
I
,
`
the
little
abbe
who
reads
LIVES
OF
THE
SAINTS
,
and
translates
*NL*
Judith
into
verse
.
'
`
Ah
,
ah
!
I
recollect
now
,
'
said
the
officer
,
in
a
*NL*
jeering
tone
;
`
well
,
what
do
you
want
with
me
?
'
'
I
want
you
to
spare
*NL*
time
to
take
a
walk
with
me
.
'
`
Tomorrow
morning
,
if
you
like
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
pleasure
.
'
`
No

not

if
you
please
,
but
*NL*
immediately

not
disturb
yourselves

allow
me

time

to
kill
this

We
went
out

I
took
him
to
the
Rue
Payenne

to
exactly
the

spot

,
a
year
before

at
the
very

hour

he
had
paid
me
the
*NL*
compliment
I
have
related
to
you

It
was
a
superb
moonlight
night

We
*NL*
immediately
drew
,

at

first

I
laid
him
stark
dead

*NL*
``
The

cried
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

continued
Aramis
,
``
as
the
ladies
did
not
see
the

come
*NL*
back

as
he
was
found
in
the
Rue
Payenne
with
a
great
sword
wound
*NL*
through
his
body
,
it
was
supposed
that
I
had
accommodated
him
thus
;
and
*NL*
the
matter
created
some
scandal
which
obliged
me
to
renounce
the
cassock
*NL*
for
a
time

Athos
,
whose
acquaintance
I
made
about
that
period
,
and
*NL*
Porthos
,
who
had
in
addition
to
my
lessons
taught
me
some
effective
*NL*
tricks
of
fence
,
prevailed
upon
me
to
solicit
the
uniform
of
a
*NL*
Musketeer
.
The
king
entertained
great
regard
for
my
father
,
who
had
*NL*
fallen
at
the
siege
of
Arras
,

the
uniform
was
granted
.
You
may
*NL*
understand
that
the
moment
has
come
for
me

re-enter
the
bosom
of
the
*NL*
Church

*NL*
*NL*

And
why
today

yesterday

today

all
these
melancholy

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

my

has
been

me
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

Bah

it

you

kicking

said
d'Artagnan

the
vivacious

Aramis

informed
him

departure

higher
opinion

*NL*
Bazin
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Monsieur
Bazin
,
make
yourself
easy
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
people
of
*NL*
all
conditions
gain
the
kingdom
of
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
was
already
such
a
good
theologian
,
''
said
Bazin
,
almost
*NL*
weeping
;
``
he
might
have
become
a
bishop
,
and
perhaps
a
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
my
poor
Bazin
,
reflect
a
little
.
Of
what
use
is
it
to
be
a
*NL*
churchman
,
pray
?
You
do
not
avoid
going
to
war
by
that
means
;
you
see
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
is
about
to
make
the
next
campaign
,
helm
on
head
and
*NL*
partisan
in
hand
.
And
Monsieur
de
Nogaret
de
la
Valette
,
what
do
you
say
*NL*
of
him
?
He
is
a
cardinal
likewise
.
Ask
his
lackey
how
often
he
has
had
*NL*
to
prepare
lint
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
sighed
Bazin
.
``
I
know
it
,
monsieur
;
everything
is
turned
*NL*
topsy-turvy
in
the
world
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
dialogue
was
going
on
,
the
two
young
men
and
the
poor
lackey
*NL*
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
my
stirrup
,
Bazin
,
''
cried
Aramis
;
and
Aramis
sprang
into
the
*NL*
saddle
with
his
usual
grace
and
agility
,
but
after
a
few
vaults
and
*NL*
curvets
of
the
noble
animal
his
rider
felt
his
pains
come
on
so
*NL*
insupportably
that
he
turned
pale
and
became
unsteady
in
his
seat
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
,
foreseeing
such
an
event
,
had
kept
his
eye
on
him
,
*NL*
sprang
toward
him
,
caught
him
in
his
arms
,
and
assisted
him
to
his
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
my
dear
Aramis
,
take
care
of
yourself
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
*NL*
will
go
alone
in
search
of
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
man
of
brass
,
''
replied
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
good
luck
,
that
is
all
.
But
how
do
you
mean
to
pass
your
*NL*
time
till
I
come
back
?
No
more
theses
,
no
more
glosses
upon
the
fingers
*NL*
or
upon
benedictions
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
smiled
.
``
I
will
make
verses
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
dare
say
;
verses
perfumed
with
the
odor
of
the
billet
from
the
*NL*
attendant
of
Madame
de
Chevreuse
.
Teach
Bazin
prosody
;
that
will
console
*NL*
him
.
As
to
the
horse
,
ride
him
a
little
every
day
,
and
that
will
*NL*
accustom
you
to
his
maneuvers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
make
yourself
easy
on
that
head
,
''
replied
Aramis
.
``
You
will
find
me
*NL*
ready
to
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
leave
of
each
other
,
and
in
ten
minutes
,
after
having
*NL*
commended
his
friend
to
the
cares
of
the
hostess
and
Bazin
,
d'Artagnan
*NL*
was
trotting
along
in
the
direction
of
Amiens
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
he
going
to
find
Athos
?
Should
he
find
him
at
all
?
The
position
*NL*
in
which
he
had
left
him
was
critical
.
He
probably
had
succumbed
.
This
*NL*
idea
,
while
darkening
his
brow
,
drew
several
sighs
from
him
,
and
caused
*NL*
him
to
formulate
to
himself
a
few
vows
of
vengeance
.
Of
all
his
friends
,
*NL*
Athos
was
the
eldest
,
and
the
least
resembling
him
in
appearance
,
in
his
*NL*
tastes
and
sympathies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
entertained
a
marked
preference
for
this
gentleman
.
The
noble
and
*NL*
distinguished
air
of
Athos
,
those
flashes
of
greatness
which
from
time
*NL*
to
time
broke
out
from
the
shade
in
which
he
voluntarily
kept
himself
,
*NL*
that
unalterable
equality
of
temper
which
made
him
the
most
pleasant
*NL*
companion
in
the
world
,
that
forced
and
cynical
gaiety
,
that
bravery
*NL*
which
might
have
been
termed
blind
if
it
had
not
been
the
result
of
the
*NL*
rarest
coolness
--
such
qualities
attracted
more
than
the
esteem
,
more
*NL*
than
the
friendship
of
d'Artagnan
;
they
attracted
his
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
when
placed
beside
M.
de
Treville
,
the
elegant
and
noble
*NL*
courtier
,
Athos
in
his
most
cheerful
days
might
advantageously
sustain
a
*NL*
comparison
.
He
was
of
middle
height
;
but
his
person
was
so
admirably
*NL*
shaped
and
so
well
proportioned
that
more
than
once
in
his
struggles
*NL*
with
Porthos
he
had
overcome
the
giant
whose
physical
strength
was
*NL*
proverbial
among
the
Musketeers
.
His
head
,
with
piercing
eyes
,
a
*NL*
straight
nose
,
a
chin
cut
like
that
of
Brutus
,
had
altogether
an
*NL*
indefinable
character
of
grandeur
and
grace
.
His
hands
,
of
which
he
took
*NL*
little
care
,
were
the
despair
of
Aramis
,
who
cultivated
his
with
almond
*NL*
paste
and
perfumed
oil
.
The
sound
of
his
voice
was
at
once
penetrating
*NL*
and
melodious
;
and
then
,
that
which
was
inconceivable
in
Athos
,
who
was
*NL*
always
retiring
,
was
that
delicate
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
the
*NL*
usages
of
the
most
brilliant
society
--
those
manners
of
a
high
degree
*NL*
which
appeared
,
as
if
unconsciously
to
himself
,
in
his
least
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
repast
were
on
foot
,
Athos
presided
over
it
better
than
any
other
,
*NL*
placing
every
guest
exactly
in
the
rank
which
his
ancestors
had
earned
*NL*
for
him
or
that
he
had
made
for
himself
.
If
a
question
in
heraldry
were
*NL*
started
,
Athos
knew
all
the
noble
families
of
the
kingdom
,
their
*NL*
genealogy
,
their
alliances
,
their
coats
of
arms
,
and
the
origin
of
them
.
*NL*
Etiquette
had
no
minutiae
unknown
to
him
.
He
knew
what
were
the
rights
*NL*
of
the
great
land
owners
.
He
was
profoundly
versed
in
hunting
and
*NL*
falconry
,
and
had
one
day
when
conversing
on
this
great
art
astonished
*NL*
even
Louis
XIII
himself
,
who
took
a
pride
in
being
considered
a
past
*NL*
master
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
the
great
nobles
of
that
period
,
Athos
rode
and
fenced
to
*NL*
perfection
.
But
still
further
,
his
education
had
been
so
little
*NL*
neglected
,
even
with
respect
to
scholastic
studies
,
so
rare
at
this
time
*NL*
among
gentlemen
,
that
he
smiled
at
the
scraps
of
Latin
which
Aramis
*NL*
sported
and
which
Porthos
pretended
to
understand
.
Two
or
three
times
,
*NL*
even
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
his
friends
,
he
had
,
when
Aramis
*NL*
allowed
some
rudimental
error
to
escape
him
,
replaced
a
verb
in
its
*NL*
right
tense
and
a
noun
in
its
case
.
Besides
,
his
probity
was
*NL*
irreproachable
,
in
an
age
in
which
soldiers
compromised
so
easily
with
*NL*
their
religion
and
their
consciences
,
lovers
with
the
rigorous
delicacy
*NL*
of
our
era
,
and
the
poor
with
God
's
Seventh
Commandment
.
This
Athos
,
*NL*
then
,
was
a
very
extraordinary
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
this
nature
so
distinguished
,
this
creature
so
beautiful
,
this
*NL*
essence
so
fine
,
was
seen
to
turn
insensibly
toward
material
life
,
as
*NL*
old
men
turn
toward
physical
and
moral
imbecility
.
Athos
,
in
his
hours
*NL*
of
gloom
--
and
these
hours
were
frequent
--
was
extinguished
as
to
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
luminous
portion
of
him
,
and
his
brilliant
side
disappeared
*NL*
as
into
profound
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
demigod
vanished
;
he
remained
scarcely
a
man
.
His
head
hanging
*NL*
down
,
his
eye
dull
,
his
speech
slow
and
painful
,
Athos
would
look
for
*NL*
hours
together
at
his
bottle
,
his
glass
,
or
at
Grimaud
,
who
,
accustomed
*NL*
to
obey
him
by
signs
,
read
in
the
faint
glance
of
his
master
his
least
*NL*
desire
,
and
satisfied
it
immediately
.
If
the
four
friends
were
assembled
*NL*
at
one
of
these
moments
,
a
word
,
thrown
forth
occasionally
with
a
*NL*
violent
effort
,
was
the
share
Athos
furnished
to
the
conversation
.
In
*NL*
exchange
for
his
silence
Athos
drank
enough
for
four
,
and
without
*NL*
appearing
to
be
otherwise
affected
by
wine
than
by
a
more
marked
*NL*
constriction
of
the
brow
and
by
a
deeper
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
whose
inquiring
disposition
we
are
acquainted
with
,
had
*NL*
not
--
whatever
interest
he
had
in
satisfying
his
curiosity
on
this
*NL*
subject
--
been
able
to
assign
any
cause
for
these
fits
,
or
for
the
*NL*
periods
of
their
recurrence
.
Athos
never
received
any
letters
;
Athos
*NL*
never
had
concerns
which
all
his
friends
did
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
be
said
that
it
was
wine
which
produced
this
sadness
;
for
*NL*
in
truth
he
only
drank
to
combat
this
sadness
,
which
wine
however
,
as
we
*NL*
have
said
,
rendered
still
darker
.
This
excess
of
bilious
humor
could
not
*NL*
be
attributed
to
play
;
for
unlike
Porthos
,
who
accompanied
the
*NL*
variations
of
chance
with
songs
or
oaths
,
Athos
when
he
won
remained
as
*NL*
unmoved
as
when
he
lost
.
He
had
been
known
,
in
the
circle
of
the
*NL*
Musketeers
,
to
win
in
one
night
three
thousand
pistoles
;
to
lose
them
*NL*
even
to
the
gold-embroidered
belt
for
gala
days
,
win
all
this
again
with
*NL*
the
addition
of
a
hundred
louis
,
without
his
beautiful
eyebrow
being
*NL*
heightened
or
lowered
half
a
line
,
without
his
hands
losing
their
pearly
*NL*
hue
,
without
his
conversation
,
which
was
cheerful
that
evening
,
ceasing
*NL*
to
be
calm
and
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
was
it
,
as
with
our
neighbors
,
the
English
,
an
atmospheric
*NL*
influence
which
darkened
his
countenance
;
for
the
sadness
generally
*NL*
became
more
intense
toward
the
fine
season
of
the
year
.
June
and
July
*NL*
were
the
terrible
months
with
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
present
he
had
no
anxiety
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
when
people
*NL*
spoke
of
the
future
.
His
secret
,
then
,
was
in
the
past
,
as
had
often
*NL*
been
vaguely
said
to
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mysterious
shade
,
spread
over
his
whole
person
,
rendered
still
more
*NL*
interesting
the
man
whose
eyes
or
mouth
,
even
in
the
most
complete
*NL*
intoxication
,
had
never
revealed
anything
,
however
skillfully
questions
*NL*
had
been
put
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
thought
d'Artagnan
,
``
poor
Athos
is
perhaps
at
this
moment
dead
,
*NL*
and
dead
by
my
fault
--
for
it
was
I
who
dragged
him
into
this
affair
,
of
*NL*
which
he
did
not
know
the
origin
,
of
which
he
is
ignorant
of
the
result
,
*NL*
and
from
which
he
can
derive
no
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
reckoning
,
monsieur
,
''
added
Planchet
to
his
master
's
audibly
*NL*
expressed
reflections
,
``
that
we
perhaps
owe
our
lives
to
him
.
Do
you
*NL*
remember
how
he
cried
,
`
On
,
d'Artagnan
,
on
,
I
am
taken
'
?
And
when
he
had
*NL*
discharged
his
two
pistols
,
what
a
terrible
noise
he
made
with
his
*NL*
sword
!
One
might
have
said
that
twenty
men
,
or
rather
twenty
mad
devils
,
*NL*
were
fighting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
redoubled
the
eagerness
of
d'Artagnan
,
who
urged
his
horse
,
*NL*
though
he
stood
in
need
of
no
incitement
,
and
they
proceeded
at
a
rapid
*NL*
pace
.
About
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
they
perceived
Amiens
,
and
at
*NL*
half
past
eleven
they
were
at
the
door
of
the
cursed
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
often
meditated
against
the
perfidious
host
one
of
those
*NL*
hearty
vengeances
which
offer
consolation
while
they
are
hoped
for
.
He
*NL*
entered
the
hostelry
with
his
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
,
his
left
hand
on
*NL*
the
pommel
of
the
sword
,
and
cracking
his
whip
with
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
me
?
''
said
he
to
the
host
,
who
advanced
to
greet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
that
honor
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
the
latter
,
his
eyes
*NL*
dazzled
by
the
brilliant
style
in
which
d'Artagnan
traveled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
do
n't
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
two
words
will
refresh
your
memory
.
What
have
you
done
with
that
*NL*
gentleman
against
whom
you
had
the
audacity
,
about
twelve
days
ago
,
to
*NL*
make
an
accusation
of
passing
false
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
became
as
pale
as
death
;
for
d'Artagnan
had
assumed
a
*NL*
threatening
attitude
,
and
Planchet
modeled
himself
after
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monseigneur
,
do
not
mention
it
!
''
cried
the
host
,
in
the
most
*NL*
pitiable
voice
imaginable
.
``
Ah
,
monseigneur
,
how
dearly
have
I
paid
for
*NL*
that
fault
,
unhappy
wretch
as
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
gentleman
,
I
say
,
what
has
become
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deign
to
listen
to
me
,
monseigneur
,
and
be
merciful
!
Sit
down
,
in
*NL*
mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
mute
with
anger
and
anxiety
,
took
a
seat
in
the
threatening
*NL*
attitude
of
a
judge
.
Planchet
glared
fiercely
over
the
back
of
his
*NL*
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
story
,
monseigneur
,
''
resumed
the
trembling
host
;
``
for
I
now
*NL*
recollect
you
.
It
was
you
who
rode
off
at
the
moment
I
had
that
*NL*
unfortunate
difference
with
the
gentleman
you
speak
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
I
;
so
you
may
plainly
perceive
that
you
have
no
mercy
to
*NL*
expect
if
you
do
not
tell
me
the
whole
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Condescend
to
listen
to
me
,
and
you
shall
know
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
been
warned
by
the
authorities
that
a
celebrated
coiner
of
bad
*NL*
money
would
arrive
at
my

Monseigneur

I
was
furnished
with
a
*NL*
description
of
your
horses

your

your
countenances

nothing

omitted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

said
d'Artagnan

who
quickly
understood
whence
such
an
*NL*
exact
description
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
then
,
in
conformity
with
the
orders

the
authorities

sent
*NL*
me
a
reinforcement
of
six
men

such
measures

I
thought
necessary
to

get
possession
of
the
persons
of
the
pretended
coiners

*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
whose
ears
chafed
terribly
under
the
*NL*
repetition
of
this
word
COINERs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
monseigneur
,
for
saying
such
things

but
they
form
my
*NL*
excuse

The

terrified
me
,

you
know
that
an
innkeeper

must
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
authorities

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
once
again

that

the

with
an
acuteness
that
did
not
escape
d'Artagnan

by
an

*NL*
``
Miserable
scoundrel

cried
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

monseigneur

we
were
not

not

the
honorable

no

he
bears

Monsieur
your
*NL*

having
disabled
two
men
with
his
pistols
,
retreated
fighting
*NL*
with
his
sword
,
with
which
he
disabled
one
of
my
men

stunned
me
*NL*
with
a
blow
of
the
flat
side
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

cried
d'Artagnan

``
Athos

what
has

become

*NL*
*NL*
``
While
fighting
and
retreating
,
as
I
have
told
Monseigneur

he
found
the
*NL*
door
of
the
cellar
stairs
behind
him
,
and
as
the
door
was
open
,
he
took
*NL*
out
the
key
,
and
barricaded
himself
inside
.
As
we
were
sure
of
finding
*NL*
him
there
,
we
left
him
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
did
not
really
wish
to
kill
;
you
only
*NL*
wished
to
imprison
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
To
imprison
him
,
monseigneur
?
Why
,
he
imprisoned
himself
,
I
*NL*
swear
to
you
he
did
.
In
the
first
place
he
had
made
rough
work
of
it
;
*NL*
one
man
was
killed
on
the
spot
,
and
two
others
were
severely
wounded
.
*NL*
The
dead
man
and
the
two
wounded
were
carried
off
by
their
comrades
,
and
*NL*
I
have
heard
nothing
of
either
of
them
since
.
As
for
myself
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
I
recovered
my
senses
I
went
to
Monsieur
the
Governor
,
to
whom
I
related
*NL*
all
that
had
passed
,
and
asked
,
what
I
should
do
with
my
prisoner
.
*NL*
Monsieur
the
Governor
was
all
astonishment
.
He
told
me
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
about
the
matter
,
that
the
orders
I
had
received
did
not
come
from
him
,
*NL*
and
that
if
I
had
the
audacity
to
mention
his
name
as
being
concerned
in
*NL*
this
disturbance
he
would
have
me
hanged
.
It
appears
that
I
had
made
a
*NL*
mistake
,
monsieur
,
that
I
had
arrested
the
wrong
person
,
and
that
he
*NL*
whom
I
ought
to
have
arrested
had
escaped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Athos
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
whose
impatience
was
increased
by
the
*NL*
disregard
of
the
authorities
,
``
Athos
,
where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
was
anxious
to
repair
the
wrongs
I
had
done
the
prisoner
,
''
resumed
*NL*
the
innkeeper
,
``
I
took
my
way
straight
to
the
cellar
in
order
to
set
him
*NL*
at
liberty
.
Ah
,
monsieur
,
he
was
no
longer
a
man
,
he
was
a
devil
!
To
my
*NL*
offer
of
liberty
,
he
replied
that
it
was
nothing
but
a
snare
,
and
that
*NL*
before
he
came
out
he
intended
to
impose
his
own
conditions
.
I
told
him
*NL*
very
humbly
--
for
I
could
not
conceal
from
myself
the
scrape
I
had
got
*NL*
into
by
laying
hands
on
one
of
his
Majesty
's
Musketeers
--
I
told
him
I
*NL*
was
quite
ready
to
submit
to
his
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
the
first
place
,
'
said
he
,
'
I
wish
my
lackey
placed
with
me
,
fully
*NL*
armed

'
We
hastened
to
obey
this
order
;
for
you
will
please
to
*NL*
understand
,
monsieur
,
we
were
disposed
to
do
everything
your
friend
*NL*
could
desire
.
Monsieur
Grimaud
-LRB-
he
told
us
his
name
,
although
he
does
*NL*
not
talk
much
-RRB-
--
Monsieur
Grimaud
,
then
,
went
down
to
the
cellar
,
wounded
*NL*
as
he
was
;
then
his
master
,
having
admitted
him
,
barricaded
the
door
*NL*
afresh
,
and
ordered
us
to
remain
quietly
in
our
own
bar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
Athos
now
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
Where
is
Athos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
cellar
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
scoundrel
!
Have
you
kept
him
in
the
cellar
all
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful
heaven
!
No
,
monsieur
!
We
keep
him
in
the
cellar
!
You
do
not
*NL*
know
what
he
is
about
in
the
cellar
.
Ah
!
If
you
could
but
persuade
him
*NL*
to
come
out
,
monsieur
,
I
should
owe
you
the
gratitude
of
my
whole
life
;
*NL*
I
should
adore
you
as
my
patron
saint
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
is
there
?
I
shall
find
him
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
you
will
,
monsieur
;
he
persists
in
remaining
there
.
We
*NL*
every
day
pass
through
the
air
hole
some
bread
at
the
end
of
a
fork
,
and
*NL*
some
meat
when
he
asks
for
it
;
but
alas
!
It
is
not
of
bread
and
meat
of
*NL*
which
he
makes
the
greatest
consumption
.
I
once
endeavored
to
go
down
*NL*
with
two
of
my
servants
;
but
he
flew
into
terrible
rage
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
noise
he
made
in
loading
his
pistols
,
and
his
servant
in
loading
his
*NL*
musketoon
.
Then
,
when
we
asked
them
what
were
their
intentions
,
the
*NL*
master
replied
that
he
had
forty
charges
to
fire
,
and
that
he
and
his
*NL*
lackey
would
fire
to
the
last
one
before
he
would
allow
a
single
soul
of
*NL*
us
to
set
foot
in
the
cellar
.
Upon
this
I
went
and
complained
to
the
*NL*
governor
,
who
replied
that
I
only
had
what
I
deserved
,
and
that
it
would
*NL*
teach
me
to
insult
honorable
gentlemen
who
took
up
their
abode
in
my
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
since
that
time
--
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
totally
unable
to
*NL*
refrain
from
laughing
at
the
pitiable
face
of
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
from
that
time
,
monsieur
,
''
continued
the
latter
,
``
we
have
led
the
*NL*
most
miserable
life
imaginable
;
for
you
must
know
,
monsieur
,
that
all
*NL*
our
provisions
are
in
the
cellar
.
There
is
our
wine
in
bottles
,
and
our
*NL*
wine
in
casks
;
the
beer
,
the
oil
,
and
the
spices
,
the
bacon
,
and
*NL*
sausages
.
And
as
we
are
prevented
from
going
down
there
,
we
are
forced
*NL*
to
refuse
food
and
drink
to
the
travelers
who
come
to
the
house
;
so
that
*NL*
our
hostelry
is
daily
going
to
ruin
.
If
your
friend
remains
another
week
*NL*
in
my
cellar
I
shall
be
a
ruined
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
more
than
justice
,
either
,
you
ass
!
Could
you
not
perceive
by
*NL*
our
appearance
that
we
were
people
of
quality
,
and
not
coiners
--
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
you
are
right

said
the
host
.
``
But
,
hark
,
hark
!
There
*NL*
he
is
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
has
disturbed
him
,
without
doubt

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
must
be
disturbed

cried
the
host
;

Here
are
two
English
*NL*
gentlemen
just
arrived

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
English
like
good
wine

as
you
may
know

monsieur

these
have
*NL*
asked
for
the
best

My
wife
has
perhaps
requested
permission
of
Monsieur
*NL*
Athos
to
go
into
the
cellar
to
satisfy
these
gentlemen
;
and
he
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
has
refused
.
Ah
,
good
heaven
!
There
is
the
hullabaloo
louder
than
*NL*
ever
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
in
fact
,
heard
a
great
noise
on
the
side
next
the
cellar
.
He
*NL*
rose
,
and
preceded
by
the
host
wringing
his
hands
,
and
followed
by
*NL*
Planchet
with
his
musketoon
ready
for
use
,
he
approached
the
scene
of
*NL*
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
were
exasperated
;
they
had
had
a
long
ride
,
and
were
*NL*
dying
with
hunger
and
thirst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
tyranny
!
''
cried
one
of
them
,
in
very
good
French
,
though
*NL*
with
a
foreign
accent
,
``
that
this
madman
will
not
allow
these
good
*NL*
people
access
to
their
own
wine
!
Nonsense
,
let
us
break
open
the
door
,
*NL*
and
if
he
is
too
far
gone
in
his
madness
,
well
,
we
will
kill
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Softly
,
gentlemen
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
drawing
his
pistols
from
his
belt
,
*NL*
``
you
will
kill
nobody
,
if
you
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
good
!
''
cried
the
calm
voice
of
Athos
,
from
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
door
,
``
let
them
just
come
in
,
these
devourers
of
little
children
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brave
as
they
appeared
to
be
,
the
two
English
gentlemen
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
hesitatingly
.
One
might
have
thought
there
was
in
that
cellar
one
*NL*
of
those
famished
ogres
--
the
gigantic
heroes
of
popular
legends
,
into
*NL*
whose
cavern
nobody
could
force
their
way
with
impunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
silence
;
but
at
length
the
two
Englishmen
felt
*NL*
ashamed
to
draw
back
,
and
the
angrier
one
descended
the
five
or
six
*NL*
steps
which
led
to
the
cellar
,
and
gave
a
kick
against
the
door
enough
*NL*
to
split
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
cocking
his
pistols
,
``
I
will
take
charge
of
*NL*
the
one
at
the
top
;
you
look
to
the
one
below
.
Ah
,
gentlemen
,
you
want
*NL*
battle
;
and
you
shall
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
the
hollow
voice
of
Athos
,
``
I
can
hear
d'Artagnan
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
raising
his
voice
in
turn
,
``
I
am
here
,
my
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
,
then
,
''
replied
Athos
,
``
we
will
teach
them
,
these
door
*NL*
breakers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
had
drawn
their
swords
,
but
they
found
themselves
taken
*NL*
between
two
fires
.
They
still
hesitated
an
instant
;
but
,
as
before
,
*NL*
pride
prevailed
,
and
a
second
kick
split
the
door
from
bottom
to
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
on
one
side
,
d'Artagnan
,
stand
on
one
side
,
''
cried
Athos
.
``
I
am
*NL*
going
to
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
exclaimed
d'Artagnan
,
whom
reflection
never
abandoned
,
*NL*
``
gentlemen
,
think
of
what
you
are
about

Patience
,
Athos
!
You
are
*NL*
running
your
heads
into
a
very
silly
affair
;
you
will
be
riddled
.
My
*NL*
lackey
and
I
will
have
three
shots
at
you
,
and
you
will
get
as
many
from
*NL*
the
cellar
.
You
will
then
have
our
swords
,
with
which
,
I
can
assure
you
,
*NL*
my
friend
and
I
can
play
tolerably
well
.
Let
me
conduct
your
business
*NL*
and
my
own
.
You
shall
soon
have
something
to
drink
;
I
give
you
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
any
left
,
''
grumbled
the
jeering
voice
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
felt
a
cold
sweat
creep
down
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
`
If
there
is
any
left
!
'
''
murmured
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
!
There
must
be
plenty
left
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
Be
*NL*
satisfied
of
that
;
these
two
can
not
have
drunk
all
the
cellar
.
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
return
your
swords
to
their
scabbards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
provided
you
replace
your
pistols
in
your
belt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
set
the
example
.
Then
,
turning
toward
Planchet
,
he
made
*NL*
him
a
sign
to
uncock
his
musketoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishmen
,
convinced
of
these
peaceful
proceedings
,
sheathed
their
*NL*
swords
grumblingly
.
The
history
of
Athos
's
imprisonment
was
then
related
*NL*
to
them
;
and
as
they
were
really
gentlemen
,
they
pronounced
the
host
in
*NL*
the
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
go
up
to
your
room
again
;
and
in
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
I
will
answer
for
it
,
you
shall
have
all
you
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishmen
bowed
and
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
am
alone
,
my
dear
Athos
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
open
the
door
,
I
beg
*NL*
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Instantly
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
was
heard
a
great
noise
of
fagots
being
removed
and
of
the
groaning
*NL*
of
posts
;
these
were
the
counterscarps
and
bastions
of
Athos
,
which
the
*NL*
besieged
himself
demolished
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
after
,
the
broken
door
was
removed
,
and
the
pale
face
of
*NL*
Athos
appeared
,
who
with
a
rapid
glance
took
a
survey
of
the
*NL*
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
threw
himself
on
his
neck
and
embraced
him
tenderly
.
He
then
*NL*
tried
to
draw
him
from
his
moist
abode
,
but
to
his
surprise
he
perceived
*NL*
that
Athos
staggered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wounded
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
Not
at
all
.
I
am
dead
drunk
,
that
's
all
,
and
never
did
a
man
more
*NL*
strongly
set
about
getting
so
.
By
the
Lord
,
my
good
host
!
I
must
at
*NL*
least
have
drunk
for
my
part
a
hundred
and
fifty
bottles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
''
cried
the
host
,
``
if
the
lackey
has
drunk
only
half
as
much
as
*NL*
the
master
,
I
am
a
ruined
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grimaud
is
a
well-bred
lackey
.
He
would
never
think
of
faring
in
the
*NL*
same
manner
as
his
master
;
he
only
drank
from
the
cask
.
Hark
!
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
he
put
the
faucet
in
again
.
Do
you
hear
it
?
It
is
running
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
burst
into
a
laugh
which
changed
the
shiver
of
the
host
into
*NL*
a
burning
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Grimaud
appeared
in
his
turn
behind
his
master
,
with
*NL*
the
musketoon
on
his
shoulder
,
and
his
head
shaking
.
Like
one
of
those
*NL*
drunken
satyrs
in
the
pictures
of
Rubens
.
He
was
moistened
before
and
*NL*
behind
with
a
greasy
liquid
which
the
host
recognized
as
his
best
olive
*NL*
oil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
crossed
the
public
room
and
proceeded
to
take
possession
of
the
*NL*
best
apartment
in
the
house
,
which
d'Artagnan
occupied
with
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
host
and
his
wife
hurried
down
with
lamps
into
the
*NL*
cellar
,
which
had
so
long
been
interdicted
to
them
and
where
a
frightful
*NL*
spectacle
awaited
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
fortifications
through
which
Athos
had
made
a
breach
in
order
*NL*
to
get
out
,
and
which
were
composed
of
fagots
,
planks
,
and
empty
casks
,
*NL*
heaped
up
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
strategic
art
,
they
found
,
*NL*
swimming
in
puddles
of
oil
and
wine
,
the
bones
and
fragments
of
all
the
*NL*
hams
they
had
eaten
;
while
a
heap
of
broken
bottles
filled
the
whole
*NL*
left-hand
corner
of
the
cellar
,
and
a
tun
,
the
cock
of
which
was
left
*NL*
running
,
was
yielding
,
by
this
means
,
the
last
drop
of
its
blood
.
``
The
*NL*
image
of
devastation
and
death
,
''
as
the
ancient
poet
says
,
``
reigned
as
*NL*
over
a
field
of
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
fifty
large
sausages
,
suspended
from
the
joists
,
scarcely
ten
*NL*
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
lamentations
of
the
host
and
hostess
pierced
the
vault
of
the
*NL*
cellar
.
D'Artagnan
himself
was
moved
by
them
.
Athos
did
not
even
turn
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
grief
succeeded
rage
.
The
host
armed
himself
with
a
spit
,
and
rushed
*NL*
into
the
chamber
occupied
by
the
two
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
wine
!
''
said
Athos
,
on
perceiving
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
wine
!
''
cried
the
stupefied
host
,
``
some
wine
?
Why
you
have
drunk
*NL*
more
than
a
hundred
pistoles
'
worth
!
I
am
a
ruined
man
,
lost
,
*NL*
destroyed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
we
were
always
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
been
contented
with
drinking
,
well
and
good
;
but
you
have
*NL*
broken
all
the
bottles

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pushed
me
upon
a
heap
which
rolled
down
.
That
was
your
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
my
oil
is
lost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oil
is
a
sovereign
balm
for
wounds
;
and
my
poor
Grimaud
here
was
*NL*
obliged
to
dress
those
you
had
inflicted
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
my
sausages
are
gnawed
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
an
enormous
quantity
of
rats
in
that
cellar

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
pay
me
for
all
this
,
''
cried
the
exasperated
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Triple
ass
!
''
said
Athos
,
rising
;
but
he
sank
down
again
immediately
.
He
*NL*
had
tried
his
strength
to
the
utmost
.
D'Artagnan
came
to
his
relief
with
*NL*
his
whip
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
drew
back
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
teach
you
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
to
treat
the
guests
God
sends
*NL*
you
in
a
more
courteous
fashion

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
?
Say
the
devil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend

''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
if
you
annoy
us
in
this
manner
we
*NL*
will
all
four
go
and
shut
ourselves
up
in
your
cellar

and
we
will
see
*NL*
if
the
mischief
is
as
great
as
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
the
host
,
``
I
have
been
wrong

I
confess
it
,
but
*NL*
pardon

every
sin

You

I
am
a
poor
innkeeper

You
*NL*
will
have
pity
on
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
speak
in
that
way
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
you
will
break
my
heart

*NL*
and
the
tears
will
flow
from
my
eyes
as
the
wine
flowed
from
the
cask
.
*NL*
We
are
not
such
devils

we
appear
to
be

Come
hither

talk

*NL*
*NL*
The
host
approached
with
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
hither

I
say

do

continued
Athos

``
At
the
very
*NL*
moment

I

about

you

I

placed
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

contained
sixty

Deposited

*NL*
``
Very
well

get
me

back

sixty

But
Monseigneur

there
might
be
some
hopes

*NL*
``
Manage

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
d'Artagnan
,

inquire
further

Athos

In

cried
Athos
,
``
are
you
selling
my
horse

upon

I
make

d'Artagnan

the

*NL*
``
Well

there
is
another
finer

younger

you
may
take
the

old
one

let
us
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
the
host
,
quite
cheerful
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
that
at
the
bottom
,
near
the
laths

There
are
twenty-five
*NL*
bottles
of
it
left
;
all
the
rest
were
broken
by
my
fall

Bring
six
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
man
is
a
cask
!

said
the
host
,
aside
.
``
If
he
only
remains
*NL*
here
a
fortnight

pays
for
what
he
drinks
,
I
shall
soon
re-establish
*NL*
my
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
forget
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
to
bring
up
four
bottles
of
the
*NL*

sort
for
the
two
English
gentlemen

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now

Athos
,
``
while
they
bring
the
wine

d'Artagnan

*NL*
what
has
become

come

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
how
he
had
found
Porthos
in
bed
with
a
strained
knee
,
*NL*
and
Aramis
at
a
table
between
two
theologians
.
As
he
finished
,
the
host
*NL*
entered
with
the
wine
ordered
and
a
ham
which
,
fortunately
for
him
,
had
*NL*
been
left
out
of
the
cellar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
!

said
Athos
,
filling
his
glass
and
that
of
his
friend
;
*NL*
``
here
's
to
Porthos
and
Aramis
!
But
you

d'Artagnan
,
what
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
,
and
what
has
happened
to
you
personally

You
have
a
sad
air

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
is
because
I
am
the
most
unfortunate

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
!
And
why
presently
?
Because
you
think
I
am
drunk

D'Artagnan
,
*NL*
remember
this
!
My
ideas
are
never
so
clear
as
when
I
have
had
plenty
of
*NL*
wine
.
Speak

then

I
am
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
his
adventure
with
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
Athos
listened
to
*NL*
him
without
a
frown
;
and
when
he
had
finished
,
said
,
``
Trifles
,
only
*NL*
trifles
!
''
That
was
his
favorite
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
say
TRIFLES

my
dear
Athos

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
that
come
*NL*
very
ill
from
you
,
who
have
never
loved

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drink-deadened
eye
of
Athos
flashed
out
,
but
only
for
a
moment
;
it
*NL*
became
as
dull
and
vacant
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
he
,
quietly
,
``
for
my
part
I
have
never
loved

*NL*
*NL*
``
Acknowledge
,
then

you
stony
heart

said
d'Artagnan

``
that
you
are
*NL*
wrong

be
so
hard
upon
us
tender
hearts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tender
hearts

Pierced

said
Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
love

a
lottery

And

any
counsel

there
lives

deceived

silence

Let
us
drink

*NL*
``
But
then

d'Artagnan

stand
in
need

being
taught

consoled

``
Consoled

For
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
misfortune
is
laughable

said
Athos
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
``
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
what
you
would
say

I
were

relate

tale
of

emptying

refilling
his

The
two

agree
marvelously
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
attention

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
collected
himself
,
and
in
proportion
as
he
did
so
,
d'Artagnan
saw
*NL*
that
he
became
pale
.
He
was
at
that
period
of
intoxication
in
which
*NL*
vulgar
drinkers
fall
on
the
floor
and
go
to
sleep
.
He
kept
himself
*NL*
upright
and
dreamed
,
without
sleeping
.
This
somnambulism
of
drunkenness
*NL*
had
something

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
particularly
wish
it
?

asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pray
for
it

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it

One
of
my

one
of
my
friends

*NL*
to
observe

not
myself

''
said
Athos
,
interrupting
himself
with
a
*NL*
melancholy
smile
,
``
one
of
the
counts
of
my
province
--
that
is
to
say
,
of
*NL*
Berry
--
noble
as
a
Dandolo
or
a
Montmorency
,
at
twenty-five
years
of
age
*NL*
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
of
sixteen
,
beautiful
as
fancy
can
paint
.
*NL*
Through
the
ingenuousness
of
her
age
beamed
an
ardent
mind
,
not
of
the
*NL*
woman
,
but
of
the
poet
.
She
did
not
please
;
she
intoxicated
.
She
lived
*NL*
in
a
small
town
with
her
brother
,
who
was
a
curate
.
Both
had
recently
*NL*
come
into
the
country
.
They
came
nobody
knew
whence
;
but
when
seeing
her
*NL*
so
lovely
and
her
brother
so
pious
,
nobody
thought
of
asking
whence
they
*NL*
came
.
They
were
said
,
however
,
to
be
of
good
extraction
.
My
friend
,
who
*NL*
was
seigneur
of
the
country
,
might
have
seduced
her
,
or
taken
her
by
*NL*
force
,
at
his
will
--
for
he
was
master
.
Who
would
have
come
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
two
strangers
,
two
unknown
persons
?
Unfortunately
he
was
*NL*
an
honorable
man
;
he
married
her
.
The
fool
!
The
ass
!
The
idiot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
,
if
he
love
her
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
He
took
her
to
his
chateau
,
and
made
her
the
first
*NL*
lady
in
the
province
;
and
in
justice
it
must
be
allowed
that
she
*NL*
supported
her
rank
becomingly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

one
day
when
she
was
hunting
with
her
husband

continued
Athos
,
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
,
and
speaking
very
quickly
,
``
she
fell
from
her
horse
and
*NL*
fainted

The
count
flew
to
her
to
help
,
and
as
she
appeared
to
be
*NL*
oppressed
by
her
clothes
,
he
ripped
them
open
with
his
poniard
,
and
in
*NL*
so
doing
laid
bare
her
shoulder

Athos

with
a
*NL*
maniacal
burst
of
laughter

what
she
had
on
her
shoulder

*NL*
*NL*

How
can
I

A

Athos

She
was

*NL*
Athos
emptied
at
a
single
draught
the
glass
he
held
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horror

cried
d'Artagnan

you
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Truth

And
what
did

*NL*
*NL*

The
count
was
of
the

on

He
tore
the
dress
of

pieces

he
tied
her

hanged
her

No

Athos

as
pale
as
a
corpse

But
methinks
I
need
wine

*NL*
and
he
seized
by
the
neck
the
last
bottle
that
was
left
,
put
it
to
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
emptied
it
at
a
single
draught
,
as
he
would
have
emptied
an
*NL*
ordinary
glass

*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
let
his
head
sink
upon
his
two
hands

while
d'Artagnan
stood
*NL*
before
him
,
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
cured
me
of
beautiful
,
poetical

said
*NL*
Athos
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
raising
his
head
,
and
forgetting
to
*NL*
continue
the
fiction
of
the
count
.
``
God
grant
you
as
much
!
Let
us

drink

*NL*
*NL*

Then

stammered
d'Artagnan

*NL*
``

Athos

d'Artagnan

timidly

*NL*
``
Yes

I
inquired

quite
stunned
by

horrible
adventure

*NL*
``
Taste
some

cutting
a
slice

he
placed
on
the
young

plate

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
could
no
longer
endure
this
conversation
,
which
had
made
him
*NL*
bewildered
.
Allowing
his
head
to
sink
upon
his
two
hands

he
pretended

to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These

Athos

THE
RETURN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
astounded
by
the
terrible
confidence
of
Athos
;
yet
many
*NL*
things
appeared
very
obscure
to
him
in
this
half
revelation
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
it
had
been
made
by
a
man
quite
drunk
to
one
who
was
half
*NL*
drunk
;
and
yet
,
in
spite
of
the
incertainty
which
the
vapor
of
three
or
*NL*
four
bottles
of
Burgundy
carries
with
it
to
the
brain
,
d'Artagnan
,
when
*NL*
awaking
on
the
following
morning
,
had
all
the
words
of
Athos
as
present
*NL*
to
his
memory
as
if
they
then
fell
from
his
mouth
--
they
had
been
so
*NL*
impressed
upon
his
mind
.
All
this
doubt
only
gave
rise
to
a
more
lively
*NL*
desire
of
arriving
at
a
certainty
,
and
he
went
into
his
friend
's
chamber
*NL*
with
a
fixed
determination
of
renewing
the
conversation
of
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
;
but
he
found
Athos
quite
himself
again
--
that
is
to
say
,
the
*NL*
most
shrewd
and
impenetrable
of
men
.
Besides
which
,
the
Musketeer
,
after
*NL*
having
exchanged
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
with
him
,
broached
the
*NL*
matter
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
pretty
drunk
yesterday
,
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
can
tell
that
by
*NL*
my
tongue
,
which
was
swollen
and
hot
this
morning
,
and
by
my
pulse
,
*NL*
which
was
very
tremulous
.
I
wager
that
I
uttered
a
thousand
*NL*
extravagances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
saying
this
he
looked
at
his
friend
with
an
earnestness
that
*NL*
embarrassed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
if
I
recollect
well
what
you
said
,
it
was
*NL*
nothing
out
of
the
common
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
surprise
me
.
I
thought
I
had
told
you
a
most
lamentable
story
.
''
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
the
young
man
as
if
he
would
read
the
bottom
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
appears
that
I
was
more
drunk
than
you
,
*NL*
since
I
remember
nothing
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
did
not
trust
this
reply
,
and
he
resumed
;
``
you
can
not
have
failed
*NL*
to
remark
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
everyone
has
his
particular
kind
of
*NL*
drunkenness
,
sad
or
gay
.
My
drunkenness
is
always
sad
,
and
when
I
am
*NL*
thoroughly
drunk
my
mania
is
to
relate
all
the
lugubrious
stories
which
*NL*
my
foolish
nurse
inculcated
into
my
brain
.
That
is
my
failing
--
a
capital
*NL*
failing
,
I
admit
;
but
with
that
exception
,
I
am
a
good
drinker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
spoke
this
in
so
natural
a
manner
that
d'Artagnan
was
shaken
in
*NL*
his
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
that
,
then
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
anxious
to
find
out
the
*NL*
truth
,
``
it
is
that
,
then
,
I
remember
as
we
remember
a
dream
.
We
were
*NL*
speaking
of
hanging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
see
how
it
is
,
''
said
Athos
,
becoming
still
paler
,
but
yet
*NL*
attempting
to
laugh
;
``
I
was
sure
it
was
so
--
the
hanging
of
people
is
my
*NL*
nightmare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
remember
now
;
yes
,
it
was
about
--
stop
*NL*
a
minute
--
yes
,
it
was
about
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
replied
Athos
,
becoming
almost
livid
;
``
that
is
my
grand
*NL*
story
of
the
fair
lady
,
and
when
I
relate
that
,
I
must
be
very
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
was
it
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
the
story
of
a
tall
,
fair
lady
,
*NL*
with
blue
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
who
was
hanged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
her
husband
,
who
was
a
nobleman
of
your
acquaintance
,
''
continued
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
looking
intently
at
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
how
a
man
may
compromise
himself
when
he
does
not
know
*NL*
what
he
says
,
''
replied
Athos
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
if
he
thought
*NL*
himself
an
object
of
pity
.
``
I
certainly
never
will
get
drunk
again
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
;
it
is
too
bad
a
habit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
silent
;
and
then
changing
the
conversation
all
at
*NL*
once
,
Athos
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
by
,
I
thank
you
for
the
horse
you
have
brought
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
your
mind
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
it
is
not
a
horse
for
hard
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
;
I
rode
him
nearly
ten
leagues
in
less
than
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
,
and
he
appeared
no
more
distressed
than
if
he
had
only
made
*NL*
the
tour
of
the
Place
St.
Sulpice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
begin
to
awaken
my
regret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Regret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
have
parted
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
here
is
the
simple
fact
.
This
morning
I
awoke
at
six
o'clock
.
You
*NL*
were
still
fast
asleep
,
and
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
;
I
was
*NL*
still
stupid
from
our
yesterday
's
debauch
.
As
I
came
into
the
public
*NL*
room
,
I
saw
one
of
our
Englishman
bargaining
with
a
dealer
for
a
horse
,
*NL*
his
own
having
died
yesterday
from
bleeding
.
I
drew
near
,
and
found
he
*NL*
was
bidding
a
hundred
pistoles
for
a
chestnut
nag
.
`
PARDIEU
,
'
said
I
,
*NL*
`
my
good
gentleman
,
I
have
a
horse
to
sell
,
too
.
'
`
Ay
,
and
a
very
fine
*NL*
one
!
I
saw
him
yesterday
;
your
friend
's
lackey
was
leading
him
.
'
`
Do
you
*NL*
think
he
is
worth
a
hundred
pistoles
?
'
`
Yes
!
Will
you
sell
him
to
me
for
*NL*
that
sum
?
'
`
No
;
but
I
will
play
for
him
.
'
`
What
?
'
`
At
dice
.
'
No
sooner
*NL*
said
than
done
,
and
I
lost
the
horse
.
Ah
,
ah
!
But
please
to
observe
I
*NL*
won
back
the
equipage
,
''
cried
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
looked
much
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
vexes
you
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
confess
it
does
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
That
horse
was
to
*NL*
have
identified
us
in
the
day
of
battle
.
It
was
a
pledge
,
a
remembrance
.
*NL*
Athos
,
you
have
done
wrong
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
friend

put
yourself
in
my
place

the
Musketeer

*NL*
``
I
was
hipped
to
death
;
and
still
further
,
upon
my
honor
,
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
English
horses
.
If
it
is
only
to
be
recognized
,
why
the
saddle
will
*NL*
suffice
for
that
;
it
is
quite
remarkable
enough
.
As
to
the
horse
,
we
can
*NL*
easily
find
some
excuse
for
its
disappearance
.
Why
the
devil
!
A
horse
is
*NL*
mortal
;
suppose
mine
had
had
the
glanders
or
the
farcy
?

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
did
not
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
vexes
me
greatly
,
''
continued
Athos
,
``
that
you
attach
so
much
*NL*
importance
to
these
animals

I
am
not
yet
at
the
end

my
story

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
have
you
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
After
having
lost
my
own
horse

nine
against
ten

see
how
near

I
*NL*
formed

rising
from

the

forget

of

d'Artagnan

undecided

so
strongly
did
the

confidence

Athos
begin
to
prevail

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly

coolly

in

of
the
Englishman

whom
he
found
in
the
stable
,
*NL*
examining
the
harnesses
with
a
greedy
eye

The
opportunity
was
good
.
He
*NL*
proposed
the
conditions
--
the
two
harnesses
,
either
against
one
horse
or
*NL*
a
hundred
pistoles
.
The
Englishman
calculated
fast
;
the
two
harnesses
*NL*
were
worth
three
hundred
pistoles
.
He
consented
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
threw
the
dice
with
a
trembling
hand
,
and
turned
up
the
*NL*
number
three
;
his
paleness
terrified
Athos
,
who
,
however
,
consented
*NL*
himself
with
saying
,
``
That
's
a
sad
throw

comrade
;
you
will
have
the
*NL*
horses
fully
equipped

monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
,
quite
triumphant
,
did
not
even
give
himself
the
trouble
*NL*
to
shake
the
dice
.
He
threw
them
on
the
table
without
looking
at
them
,
*NL*
so
sure
was
he
of
victory
;
d'Artagnan
turned
aside
to
conceal
his
ill
*NL*
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
hold

hold

said
Athos
,
wit
his
quiet
tone
;
``
that
throw

The
Englishman
looked

was
seized
with
astonishment

D'Artagnan

looked

was
seized
with
pleasure

*NL*
``

paid
down

depart
.
Peace
with
the
landlord
,
in
addition
to
*NL*
Athos
's
old
horse
,
cost
six
pistoles
.
D'Artagnan
and
Athos
took
the
nags
*NL*
of
Planchet
and
Grimaud
,
and
the
two
lackeys
started
on
foot
,
carrying
*NL*
the
saddles
on
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
ill
our
two
friends
were
mounted
,
they
were
soon
far
in
advance
*NL*
of
their
servants
,
and
arrived
at
Creveccoeur
.
From
a
distance
they
*NL*
perceived
Aramis
,
seated
in
a
melancholy
manner
at
his
window
,
looking
*NL*
out
,
like
Sister
Anne
,
at
the
dust
in
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
HOLA
,
Aramis
!
What
the
devil
are
you
doing
there
?
''
cried
the
two
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
is
that
you
,
d'Artagnan
,
and
you
,
Athos
?
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
I
*NL*
was
reflecting
upon
the
rapidity
with
which
the
blessings
of
this
world
*NL*
leave
us
.
My
English
horse
,
which
has
just
disappeared
amid
a
cloud
of
*NL*
dust
,
has
furnished
me
with
a
living
image
of
the
fragility
of
the
*NL*
things
of
the
earth
.
Life
itself
may
be
resolved
into
three
words
:
ERAT
,
*NL*
EST
,
FUIT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
--
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
began
to
suspect
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
that
I
have
just
been
duped-sixty
louis
for
a
horse
which
*NL*
by
the
manner
of
his
gait
can
do
at
least
five
leagues
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
Athos
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
do
n't
be
too
angry
with
me
,
I
beg
.
*NL*
Necessity
has
no
law
;
besides
,
I
am
the
person
punished
,
as
that
*NL*
rascally
horsedealer
has
robbed
me
of
fifty
louis
,
at
least
.
Ah
,
you
*NL*
fellows
are
good
managers
!
You
ride
on
our
lackey
's
horses
,
and
have
*NL*
your
own
gallant
steeds
led
along
carefully
by
hand
,
at
short
stages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
a
market
cart
,
which
some
minutes
before
had
*NL*
appeared
upon
the
Amiens
road
,
pulled
up
at
the
inn
,
and
Planchet
and
*NL*
Grimaud
came
out
of
it
with
the
saddles
on
their
heads
.
The
cart
was
*NL*
returning
empty
to
Paris
,
and
the
two
lackeys
had
agreed
,
for
their
*NL*
transport
,
to
slake
the
wagoner
's
thirst
along
the
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
said
Aramis
,
on
seeing
them
arrive
.
``
Nothing
but
*NL*
saddles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
you
understand
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friends
,
that
's
exactly
like
me
!
I
retained
my
harness
by
instinct
.
*NL*
HOLA

Bazin
!
Bring
my
new
saddle
and
carry
it
along
with
those
of
these
*NL*
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
you
done
with
your
ecclesiastics
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
invited
them
to
a
dinner
the
next
day
,
''
replied
*NL*
Aramis
.
``
They
have
some
capital
wine
here
--
please
to
observe
that
in
*NL*
passing
.
I
did
my
best
to
make
them
drunk
.
Then
the
curate
forbade
me
to
*NL*
quit
my
uniform
,
and
the
Jesuit
entreated
me
to
get
him
made
a
*NL*
Musketeer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
a
thesis
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
without
a
thesis

I
demand
the
*NL*
suppression
of
the
thesis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
then
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
``
I
have
lived
very
agreeably
.
I
have
*NL*
begun
a
poem
in
verses
of
one
syllable
.
That
is
rather
difficult
,
but
*NL*
the
merit
in
all
things
consists
in
the
difficulty
.
The
matter
is
*NL*
gallant
.
I
will
read
you
the
first
canto
.
It
has
four
hundred
lines
,
and
*NL*
lasts
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
my
dear
Aramis
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
detested
verses
almost
*NL*
as
much
as
he
did
Latin
,
``
add
to
the
merit
of
the
difficulty
that
of
the
*NL*
brevity
,
and
you
are
sure
that
your
poem
will
at
least
have
two
merits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
``
that
it
breathes
irreproachable
*NL*
passion

And
so
,
my
friends
,
we
return
to
Paris
?
Bravo
!
I
am
ready
.
We
*NL*
are
going
to
rejoin
that
good
fellow
,
Porthos
.
So
much
the
better
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
think
how
I
have
missed
him
,
the
great
simpleton
.
To
see
him
so
*NL*
self-satisfied
reconciles
me
with
myself
.
He
would
not
sell
his
horse
;
*NL*
not
for
a
kingdom
!
I
think
I
can
see
him
now
,
mounted
upon
his
superb
*NL*
animal
and
seated
in
his
handsome
saddle
.
I
am
sure
he
will
look
like
*NL*
the
Great
Mogul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
a
halt
for
an
hour
to
refresh
their
horses
.
Aramis
discharged
*NL*
his
bill
,
placed
Bazin
in
the
cart
with
his
comrades
,
and
they
set
*NL*
forward
to
join
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
him
up
,
less
pale
than
when
d'Artagnan
left
him
after
his
*NL*
first
visit
,
and
seated
at
a
table
on
which
,
though
he
was
alone
,
was
*NL*
spread
enough
for
four
persons
.
This
dinner
consisted
of
meats
nicely
*NL*
dressed
,
choice
wines
,
and
superb
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
PARDIEU
!

said
he
,
rising
,
``
you
come
in
the
nick

the
soup

dine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
Mousqueton

not
caught

Besides

*NL*

Porthos

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

Though
I
remember

Rue
Ferou

I
received
a

sword
wound
which
at
the
end

fifteen

eighteen
days
produced
the

effect

*NL*
``
But

No

*NL*
*NL*

PARDIEU

d'Artagnan

gravely

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Horse

said
Aramis

with
a
grimace
of
disgust

*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
alone
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
What
could
I
do

said
Porthos

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

d'Artagnan

my

the
governor

to
have
such
a

gave

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gave

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

yes

GAVE

Porthos
;
``
for

was
*NL*
worth

eighty

made
the

bargain

*NL*
*NL*
And
then
commenced
a
roar
of
laughter
in
which
they
all
joined

to
the
*NL*
astonishment
of
poor
Porthos
;
but
when
he
was
informed
of
the
cause
of
*NL*
their
hilarity

he
shared
it
vociferously
according

his
custom

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

one
comfort

Well

said
Athos

I
found
Aramis

Spanish
wine
so
good

sent
on

sixty

it
in
the
wagon

That

weakened
my

I

made

M.
de
Treville
,
*NL*
which
informed
him
that
,
at
his
request
,
the
king
had
promised
that
he
*NL*
should
enter
the
company
of
the
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
the
height
of
d'Artagnan
's
worldly
ambition
--
apart
,
be
it
*NL*
well
understood
,
from
his
desire
of
finding
Mme.
Bonacieux
--
he
ran
,
full
*NL*
of
joy
,
to
seek
his
comrades
,
whom
he
had
left
only
half
an
hour
before
,
*NL*
but
whom
he
found
very
sad
and
deeply
preoccupied
.
They
were
assembled
*NL*
in
council
at
the
residence
of
Athos
,
which
always
indicated
an
event
of
*NL*
some
gravity
.
M.
de
Treville
had
intimated
to
them
his
Majesty
's
fixed
*NL*
intention
to
open
the
campaign
on
the
first
of
May
,
and
they
must
*NL*
immediately
prepare
their
outfits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
philosophers
looked
at
one
another
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
.
*NL*
M.
de
Treville
never
jested
in
matters
relating
to
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
reckon
your
outfit
will
cost
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
can
scarcely
say
.
We
have
made
our
calculations
with
Spartan
*NL*
economy
,
and
we
each
require
fifteen
hundred
livres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
times
fifteen
makes
sixty
--
six
thousand
livres
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
with
a
thousand
livres
each
--
I
do
*NL*
not
speak
as
a
Spartan
,
but
as
a
procurator
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
PROCURATOR
roused
Porthos
.
``
Stop
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
something
,
for
I
have
not
the
shadow
of
one
,
''
said
Athos
*NL*
coolly
;
``
but
as
to
d'Artagnan
,
gentlemen
,
the
idea
of
belonging
to
OURS
*NL*
has
driven
him
out
of
his
senses
.
A
thousand
livres
!
For
my
part
,
I
*NL*
declare
I
want
two
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
times
two
makes
eight
,
''
then
said
Aramis
;
``
it
is
eight
thousand
*NL*
that
we
want
to
complete
our
outfits
,
toward
which
,
it
is
true
,
we
have
*NL*
already
the
saddles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Athos
,
waiting
till
d'Artagnan
,
who
went
to
thank
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
had
shut
the
door
,
``
besides
,
there
is
that
*NL*
beautiful
ring
which
beams
from
the
finger
of
our
friend
.
What
the
*NL*
devil
!
D'Artagnan
is
too
good
a
comrade
to
leave
his
brothers
in
*NL*
embarrassment
while
he
wears
the
ransom
of
a
king
on
his
finger
.

HUNTING
FOR
THE
EQUIPMENTS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
preoccupied
of
the
four
friends
was
certainly
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
although
he
,
in
his
quality
of
Guardsman
,
would
be
much
more
easily
*NL*
equipped
than
Messieurs
the
Musketeers
,
who
were
all
of
high
rank
;
but
*NL*
our
Gascon
cadet
was
,
as
may
have
been
observed
,
of
a
provident
and
*NL*
almost
avaricious
character
,
and
with
that
-LRB-
explain
the
contradiction
-RRB-
*NL*
so
vain
as
almost
to
rival
Porthos
.
To
this
preoccupation
of
his
vanity
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
at
this
moment
joined
an
uneasiness
much
less
selfish
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
all
his
inquiries
respecting
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
he
could
*NL*
obtain
no
intelligence
of
her
.
M.
de
Treville
had
spoken
of
her
to
the
*NL*
queen
.
The
queen
was
ignorant
where
the
mercer
's
young
wife
was
,
but
had
*NL*
promised
to
have
her
sought
for
;
but
this
promise
was
very
vague
and
did
*NL*
not
at
all
reassure
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
did
not
leave
his
chamber
;
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
take
a
*NL*
single
step
to
equip
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
still
fifteen
days
before
us
,
''
said
he
to
his
friends
,
``
well
,
*NL*
if
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
I
have
found
nothing
,
or
rather
if
nothing
*NL*
has
come
to
find
me
,
as
I
,
too
good
a
Catholic
to
kill
myself
with
a
*NL*
pistol
bullet
,
I
will
seek
a
good
quarrel
with
four
of
his
Eminence
's
*NL*
Guards
or
with
eight
Englishmen
,
and
I
will
fight
until
one
of
them
has
*NL*
killed
me
,
which
,
considering
the
number
,
can
not
fail
to
happen
.
It
will
*NL*
then
be
said
of
me
that
I
died
for
the
king
;
so
that
I
shall
have
*NL*
performed
my
duty
without
the
expense
of
an
outfit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
continued
to
walk
about
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
tossing
his
*NL*
head
and
repeating
,
``
I
shall
follow
up
on
my
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
anxious
and
negligently
dressed
,
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
seen
by
these
disastrous
details
that
desolation
reigned
in
*NL*
the
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lackeys
on
their
part
,
like
the
coursers
of
Hippolytus
,
shared
the
*NL*
sadness
of
their
masters
.
Mousqueton
collected
a
store
of
crusts
;
Bazin
,
*NL*
who
had
always
been
inclined
to
devotion
,
never
quit
the
churches
;
*NL*
Planchet
watched
the
flight
of
flies
;
and
Grimaud
,
whom
the
general
*NL*
distress
could
not
induce
to
break
the
silence
imposed
by
his
master
,
*NL*
heaved
sighs
enough
to
soften
the
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
friends
--
for
,
as
we
have
said
,
Athos
had
sworn
not
to
stir
a
*NL*
foot
to
equip
himself
--
went
out
early
in
the
morning
,
and
returned
late
*NL*
at
night
.
They
wandered
about
the
streets
,
looking
at
the
pavement
as
if
*NL*
to
see
whether
the
passengers
had
not
left
a
purse
behind
them
.
They
*NL*
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
following
tracks
,
so
observant
were
they
*NL*
wherever
they
went
.
When
they
met
they
looked
desolately
at
one
another
,
*NL*
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Have
you
found
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
Porthos
had
first
found
an
idea
,
and
had
thought
of
it
*NL*
earnestly
afterward
,
he
was
the
first
to
act
.
He
was
a
man
of
execution
,
*NL*
this
worthy
Porthos
.
D'Artagnan
perceived
him
one
day
walking
toward
the
*NL*
church
of
St.
Leu
,
and
followed
him
instinctively
.
He
entered
,
after
*NL*
having
twisted
his
mustache
and
elongated
his
imperial
,
which
always
*NL*
announced
on
his
part
the
most
triumphant
resolutions
.
As
d'Artagnan
*NL*
took
some
precautions
to
conceal
himself
,
Porthos
believed
he
had
not
*NL*
been
seen
.
D'Artagnan
entered
behind
him
.
Porthos
went
and
leaned
*NL*
against
the
side
of
a
pillar
.
D'Artagnan
,
still
unperceived
,
supported
*NL*
himself
against
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
happened
to
be
a
sermon
,
which
made
the
church
very
full
of
*NL*
people
.
Porthos
took
advantage
of
this
circumstance
to
ogle
the
women
.
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
cares
of
Mousqueton
,
the
exterior
was
far
from
announcing
*NL*
the
distress
of
the
interior
.
His
hat
was
a
little
napless
,
his
feather
*NL*
was
a
little
faded
,
his
gold
lace
was
a
little
tarnished
,
his
laces
were
*NL*
a
trifle
frayed
;
but
in
the
obscurity
of
the
church
these
things
were
*NL*
not
seen
,
and
Porthos
was
still
the
handsome
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
observed
,
on
the
bench
nearest
to
the
pillar
against
which
*NL*
Porthos
leaned
,
a
sort
of
ripe
beauty
,
rather
yellow
and
rather
dry
,
but
*NL*
erect
and
haughty
under
her
black
hood
.
The
eyes
of
Porthos
were
*NL*
furtively
cast
upon
this
lady
,
and
then
roved
about
at
large
over
the
*NL*
nave
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
side
the
lady
,
who
from
time
to
time
blushed
,
darted
with
the
*NL*
rapidity
of
lightning
a
glance
toward
the
inconstant
Porthos
;
and
then
*NL*
immediately
the
eyes
of
Porthos
wandered
anxiously
.
It
was
plain
that
*NL*
this
mode
of
proceeding
piqued
the
lady
in
the
black
hood
,
for
she
bit
*NL*
her
lips
till
they
bled
,
scratched
the
end
of
her
nose
,
and
could
not
*NL*
sit
still
in
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
seeing
this
,
retwisted
his
mustache
,
elongated
his
imperial
a
*NL*
second
time
,
and
began
to
make
signals
to
a
beautiful
lady
who
was
near
*NL*
the
choir
,
and
who
not
only
was
a
beautiful
lady
,
but
still
further
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
a
great
lady
--
for
she
had
behind
her
a
Negro
boy
who
had
brought
*NL*
the
cushion
on
which
she
knelt
,
and
a
female
servant
who
held
the
*NL*
emblazoned
bag
in
which
was
placed
the
book
from
which
she
read
the
*NL*
Mass.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
with
the
black
hood
followed
through
all
their
wanderings
the
*NL*
looks
of
Porthos
,
and
perceived
that
they
rested
upon
the
lady
with
the
*NL*
velvet
cushion
,
the
little
Negro
,
and
the
maid-servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
Porthos
played
close
.
It
was
almost
imperceptible
*NL*
motions
of
his
eyes
,
fingers
placed
upon
the
lips
,
little
assassinating
*NL*
smiles
,
which
really
did
assassinate
the
disdained
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
cried
,
``
Ahem
!
''
under
cover
of
the
MEA
CULPA
,
striking
her
*NL*
breast
so
vigorously
that
everybody
,
even
the
lady
with
the
red
cushion
,
*NL*
turned
round
toward
her
.
Porthos
paid
no
attention
.
Nevertheless
,
he
*NL*
understood
it
all
,
but
was
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
with
the
red
cushion
produced
a
great
effect
--
for
she
was
very
*NL*
handsome
--
upon
the
lady
with
the
black
hood
,
who
saw
in
her
a
rival
*NL*
really
to
be
dreaded
;
a
great
effect
upon
Porthos
,
who
thought
her
much
*NL*
prettier
than
the
lady
with
the
black
hood
;
a
great
effect
upon
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
recognized
in
her
the
lady
of
Meung
,
of
Calais
,
and
of
*NL*
Dover
,
whom
his
persecutor
,
the
man
with
the
scar
,
had
saluted
by
the
*NL*
name
of
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
without
losing
sight
of
the
lady
of
the
red
cushion
,
*NL*
continued
to
watch
the
proceedings
of
Porthos
,
which
amused
him
greatly
.
*NL*
He
guessed
that
the
lady
of
the
black
hood
was
the
procurator
's
wife
of
*NL*
the
Rue
aux
Ours
,
which
was
the
more
probable
from
the
church
of
St.
Leu
*NL*
being
not
far
from
that
locality
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
guessed
,
likewise
,
by
induction
,
that
Porthos
was
taking
his
revenge
*NL*
for
the
defeat
of
Chantilly
,
when
the
procurator
's
wife
had
proved
so
*NL*
refractory
with
respect
to
her
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
all
this
,
d'Artagnan
remarked
also
that
not
one
countenance
*NL*
responded
to
the
gallantries
of
Porthos
.
There
were
only
chimeras
and
*NL*
illusions
;
but
for
real
love
,
for
true
jealousy
,
is
there
any
reality
*NL*
except
illusions
and
chimeras
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
sermon
over
,
the
procurator
's
wife
advanced
toward
the
holy
font
.
*NL*
Porthos
went
before
her
,
and
instead
of
a
finger
,
dipped
his
whole
hand
*NL*
in
.
The
procurator
's
wife
smiled
,
thinking
that
it
was
for
her
Porthos
*NL*
had
put
himself
to
this
trouble
;
but
she
was
cruelly
and
promptly
*NL*
undeceived
.
When
she
was
only
about
three
steps
from
him
,
he
turned
his
*NL*
head
round
,
fixing
his
eyes
steadfastly
upon
the
lady
with
the
red
*NL*
cushion
,
who
had
risen
and
was
approaching
,
followed
by
her
black
boy
*NL*
and
her
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lady
of
the
red
cushion
came
close
to
Porthos
,
Porthos
drew
his
*NL*
dripping
hand
from
the
font
.
The
fair
worshipper
touched
the
great
hand
*NL*
of
Porthos
with
her
delicate
fingers
,
smiled
,
made
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
,
and
left
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
much
for
the
procurator
's
wife
;
she
doubted
not
there
was
*NL*
an
intrigue
between
this
lady
and
Porthos
.
If
she
had
been
a
great
lady
*NL*
she
would
have
fainted
;
but
as
she
was
only
a
procurator
's
wife
,
she
*NL*
contented
herself
saying
to
the
Musketeer
with
concentrated
fury
,
``
Eh
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Porthos
,
you
do
n't
offer
me
any
holy
water
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
,
started
like
a
man
awakened
from
a
*NL*
sleep
of
a
hundred
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ma-madame
!
''
cried
he
;
``
is
that
you
?
How
is
your
husband
,
our
dear
*NL*
Monsieur
Coquenard
?
Is
he
still
as
stingy
as
ever
?
Where
can
my
eyes
*NL*
have
been
not
to
have
seen
you
during
the
two
hours
of
the
sermon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
within
two
paces
of
you
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
the
procurator
's
*NL*
wife
;
``
but
you
did
not
perceive
me
because
you
had
no
eyes
but
for
the
*NL*
pretty
lady
to
whom
you
just
now
gave
the
holy
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
pretended
to
be
confused
.
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
have
remarked
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
been
blind
not
to
have
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
that
is
a
duchess
of
my
acquaintance
whom
I
have
*NL*
great
trouble
to
meet
on
account
of
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
,
and
who
*NL*
sent
me
word
that
she
should
come
today
to
this
poor
church
,
buried
in
*NL*
this
vile
quarter
,
solely
for
the
sake
of
seeing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Porthos
,
''
said
the
procurator
's
wife
,
``
will
you
have
the
*NL*
kindness
to
offer
me
your
arm
for
five
minutes
?
I
have
something
to
say
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
madame
,
''
said
Porthos
,
winking
to
himself
,
as
a
gambler
does
*NL*
who
laughs
at
the
dupe
he
is
about
to
pluck

At
that
moment
d'Artagnan
passed
in
pursuit
of
Milady
;
he
cast
a
passing
*NL*
glance
at
Porthos
,
and
beheld
this
triumphant
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
eh
!
''
said
he
,
reasoning
to
himself
according
to
the
strangely
easy
*NL*
morality
of
that
gallant
period
,
``
there
is
one
who
will
be
equipped
in
*NL*
good
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
yielding
to
the
pressure
of
the
arm
of
the
procurator
's
wife
,
*NL*
as
a
bark
yields
to
the
rudder
,
arrived
at
the
cloister
St.
Magloire
--
a
*NL*
little-frequented
passage
,
enclosed
with
a
turnstile
at
each
end
.
In
the
*NL*
daytime
nobody
was
seen
there
but
mendicants
devouring
their
crusts
,
and
*NL*
children
at
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Monsieur
Porthos
,
''
cried
the
procurator
's
wife
,
when
she
was
*NL*
assured
that
no
one
who
was
a
stranger
to
the
population
of
the
locality
*NL*
could
either
see
or
hear
her
,
``
ah
,
Monsieur
Porthos
,
you
are
a
great
*NL*
conqueror
,
as
it
appears
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
madame
?
''
said
Porthos
,
drawing
himself
up
proudly
;
``
how
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
signs
just
now
,
and
the
holy
water
!
But
that
must
be
a
princess
,
at
*NL*
least
--
that
lady
with
her
Negro
boy
and
her
maid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
Madame
,
you
are
deceived
,
''
said
Porthos
;
``
she
is
simply
a
*NL*
duchess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
running
footman
who
waited
at
the
door
,
and
that
carriage
with
*NL*
a
coachman
in
grand
livery
who
sat
waiting
on
his
seat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
had
seen
neither
the
footman
nor
the
carriage
,
but
with
the
eye
*NL*
of
a
jealous
woman
,
Mme.
Coquenard
had
seen
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
regretted
that
he
had
not
at
once
made
the
lady
of
the
red
*NL*
cushion
a
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
quite
the
pet
of
the
ladies
,
Monsieur
Porthos
!
''
resumed
the
*NL*
procurator
's
wife
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
responded
Porthos
,
``
you
may
imagine
,
with
the
physique
with
*NL*
which
nature
has
endowed
me

I
am
not
in

good
luck

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
how
quickly
men
forget

cried
the
procurator

wife
,
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
toward
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
quickly
than
the
women
,
it
seems
to
me

''
replied
Porthos
;
``
for
I
,
*NL*
madame

I
may
say
I
was
your

abandoned
by

I

the
procurator

who
began
to
*NL*
feel
that
,
to
judge
by
the
conduct
of
the
great
ladies
of
the
time

she
*NL*
was
wrong

The

uttered
a
groan

The

shed
a

sadly

the
shoulders
full

good

Porthos

melancholy

Not

here

D'ARTAGNAN
AND
THE
ENGLISHMAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
followed
Milady
without
being
perceived
by
her
.
He
saw
her
*NL*
get
into
her
carriage
,
and
heard
her
order
the
coachman
to
drive
to
St.
*NL*
Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
useless
to
try
to
keep
pace
on
foot
with
a
carriage
drawn
by
two
*NL*
powerful
horses
.
D'Artagnan
therefore
returned
to
the
Rue
Ferou
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rue
de
Seine
he
met
Planchet
,
who
had
stopped
before
the
house
of
*NL*
a
pastry
cook
,
and
was
contemplating
with
ecstasy
a
cake
of
the
most
*NL*
appetizing
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ordered
him
to
go
and
saddle
two
horses
in
M.
de
Treville
's
*NL*
stables
--
one
for
himself
,
d'Artagnan
,
and
one
for
Planchet
--
and
bring
*NL*
them
to
Athos
's
place
.
Once
for
all
,
Treville
had
placed
his
stable
at
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
proceeded
toward
the
Rue
du
Colombier
,
and
d'Artagnan
toward
*NL*
the
Rue
Ferou
.
Athos
was
at
home
,
emptying
sadly
a
bottle
of
the
famous
*NL*
Spanish
wine
he
had
brought
back
with
him
from
his
journey
into
Picardy
.
*NL*
He
made
a
sign
for
Grimaud
to
bring
a
glass
for
d'Artagnan
,
and
Grimaud
*NL*
obeyed
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
to
Athos
all
that
had
passed
at
the
church
between
*NL*
Porthos
and
the
procurator
's
wife
,
and
how
their
comrade
was
probably
by
*NL*
that
time
in
a
fair
way
to
be
equipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
me
,
''
replied
Athos
to
this
recital
,
``
I
am
quite
at
my
ease
;
it
*NL*
will
not
be
women
that
will
defray
the
expense
of
my
outfit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
,
well-bred
,
noble
lord
as
you
are
,
my
dear
Athos
,
neither
*NL*
princesses
nor
queens
would
be
secure
from
your
amorous
solicitations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
young
this
d'Artagnan
is
!
''
said
Athos
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
and
*NL*
he
made
a
sign
to
Grimaud
to
bring
another
bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Planchet
put
his
head
modestly
in
at
the
half-open
door
,
*NL*
and
told
his
master
that
the
horses
were
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
horses
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
horses
that
Monsieur
de
Treville
lends
me
at
my
pleasure
,
and
with
*NL*
which
I
am
now
going
to
take
a
ride
to
St.
Germain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
St.
Germain
?
''
then
demanded
*NL*
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
described
the
meeting
which
he
had
at
the
church
,
and
*NL*
how
he
had
found
that
lady
who
,
with
the
seigneur
in
the
black
cloak
and
*NL*
with
the
scar
near
his
temple
,
filled
his
mind
constantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
you
are
in
love
with
this
lady
as
you
were
with
Madame
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
''
said
Athos
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
contemptuously
,
as
if
he
*NL*
pitied
human
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
not
at
all
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
am
only
curious
to
unravel
the
*NL*
mystery
to
which
she
is
attached
.
I
do
not
know
why
,
but
I
imagine
that
*NL*
this
woman
,
wholly
unknown
to
me
as
she
is
,
and
wholly
unknown
to
her
as
*NL*
I
am
,
has
an
influence
over
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
you
are
right
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
I
do
not
know
a
woman
that
*NL*
is
worth
the
trouble
of
being
sought
for
when
she
is
once
lost
.
Madame
*NL*
Bonacieux
is
lost
;
so
much
the
worse
for
her
if
she
is
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Athos
,
no
,
you
are
mistaken
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
love
my
poor
*NL*
Constance
more
than
ever
,
and
if
I
knew
the
place
in
which
she
is
,
were
*NL*
it
at
the
end
of
the
world
,
I
would
go
to
free
her
from
the
hands
of
her
*NL*
enemies
;
but
I
am
ignorant
.
All
my
researches
have
been
useless
.
What
is
*NL*
to
be
said
?
I
must
divert
my
attention
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amuse
yourself
with
Milady
,
my
dear
d'Artagnan
;
I
wish
you
may
with
all
*NL*
my
heart
,
if
that
will
amuse
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
,
Athos
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Instead
of
shutting
yourself
up
here
*NL*
as
if
you
were
under
arrest
,
get
on
horseback
and
come
and
take
a
ride
*NL*
with
me
to
St.
Germain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
I
ride
horses
when
I
have
any
;
when
I
*NL*
have
none
,
I
go
afoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
smiling
at
the
misanthropy
of
Athos
,
which
from
*NL*
any
other
person
would
have
offended
him
,
``
I
ride
what
I
can
get
;
I
am
*NL*
not
so
proud
as
you
.
So
AU
REVOIR
,
dear
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
AU
REVOIR
,
''
said
the
Musketeer
,
making
a
sign
to
Grimaud
to
uncork
the
*NL*
bottle
he
had
just
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
Planchet
mounted
,
and
took
the
road
to
St.
Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
along
the
road
,
what
Athos
had
said
respecting
Mme.
Bonacieux
*NL*
recurred
to
the
mind
of
the
young
man
.
Although
d'Artagnan
was
not
of
a
*NL*
very
sentimental
character
,
the
mercer
's
pretty
wife
had
made
a
real
*NL*
impression
upon
his
heart
.
As
he
said
,
he
was
ready
to
go
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
world
to
seek
her
;
but
the
world
,
being
round
,
has
many
ends
,
so
*NL*
that
he
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
.
Meantime
,
he
was
going
to
try
to
*NL*
find
out
Milady
.
Milady
had
spoken
to
the
man
in
the
black
cloak
;
*NL*
therefore
she
knew
him
.
Now
,
in
the
opinion
of
d'Artagnan
,
it
was
*NL*
certainly
the
man
in
the
black
cloak
who
had
carried
off
Mme.
Bonacieux
*NL*
the
second
time
,
as
he
had
carried
her
off
the
first
.
D'Artagnan
then
*NL*
only
half-lied
,
which
is
lying
but
little
,
when
he
said
that
by
going
in
*NL*
search
of
Milady
he
at
the
same
time
went
in
search
of
Constance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
of
all
this
,
and
from
time
to
time
giving
a
touch
of
the
spur
*NL*
to
his
horse
,
d'Artagnan
completed
his
short
journey
,
and
arrived
at
St.
*NL*
Germain
.
He
had
just
passed
by
the
pavilion
in
which
ten
years
later
*NL*
Louis
XIV
was
born
.
He
rode
up
a
very
quiet
street
,
looking
to
the
right
*NL*
and
the
left
to
see
if
he
could
catch
any
vestige
of
his
beautiful
*NL*
Englishwoman
,
when
from
the
ground
floor
of
a
pretty
house
,
which
,
*NL*
according
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
,
had
no
window
toward
the
street
,
*NL*
he
saw
a
face
peep
out
with
which
he
thought
he
was
acquainted
.
This
*NL*
person
walked
along
the
terrace
,
which
was
ornamented
with
flowers
.
*NL*
Planchet
recognized
him
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
monsieur
!
''
said
he
,
addressing
d'Artagnan
,
``
do
n't
you
remember
that
*NL*
face
which
is
blinking
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
yet
I
am
certain
it
is
not
the
first
time
I
*NL*
have
seen
that
visage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARBLEU
,
I
believe
it
is
not
,
''
said
Planchet
.
``
Why
,
it
is
poor
Lubin
,
*NL*
the
lackey
of
the
Comte
de
Wardes
--
he
whom
you
took
such
good
care
of
a
*NL*
month
ago
at
Calais
,
on
the
road
to
the
governor
's
country
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
know
him
now
.
Do
you
think
he
would
*NL*
recollect
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
monsieur
,
he
was
in
such
trouble
that
I
doubt
if
he
can
have
*NL*
retained
a
very
clear
recollection
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
and
talk
with
the
boy
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
make
out
if
you
*NL*
can
from
his
conversation
whether
his
master
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
dismounted
and
went
straight
up
to
Lubin
,
who
did
not
at
all
*NL*
remember
him
,
and
the
two
lackeys
began
to
chat
with
the
best
*NL*
understanding
possible
;
while
d'Artagnan
turned
the
two
horses
into
a
*NL*
lane
,
went
round
the
house
,
and
came
back
to
watch
the
conference
from
*NL*
behind
a
hedge
of
filberts
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
an
instant
's
observation
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
vehicle
,
*NL*
and
saw
Milady
's
carriage
stop
opposite
to
him
.
He
could
not
be
*NL*
mistaken
;
Milady
was
in
it
.
D'Artagnan
leaned
upon
the
neck
of
his
*NL*
horse
,
in
order
that
he
might
see
without
being
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
put
her
charming
blond
head
out
at
the
window
,
and
gave
her
*NL*
orders
to
her
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
--
a
pretty
girl
of
about
twenty
or
twenty-two
years
,
active
*NL*
and
lively
,
the
true
SOUBRETTE
of
a
great
lady
--
jumped
from
the
step
*NL*
upon
which
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
,
she
was
seated
,
and
*NL*
took
her
way
toward
the
terrace
upon
which
d'Artagnan
had
perceived
*NL*
Lubin
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
followed
the
soubrette
with
his
eyes
,
and
saw
her
go
toward
*NL*
the
terrace
;
but
it
happened
that
someone
in
the
house
called
Lubin
,
so
*NL*
that
Planchet
remained
alone
,
looking
in
all
directions
for
the
road
*NL*
where
d'Artagnan
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maid
approached
Planchet
,
whom
she
took
for
Lubin
,
and
holding
out
a
*NL*
little
billet
to
him
said
,
``
For
your
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
master
?
''
replied
Planchet
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
important
.
Take
it
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
she
ran
toward
the
carriage
,
which
had
turned
round
toward
the
*NL*
way
it
came
,
jumped
upon
the
step
,
and
the
carriage
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
turned
and
returned
the
billet
.
Then
,
accustomed
to
passive
*NL*
obedience
,
he
jumped
down
from
the
terrace
,
ran
toward
the
lane
,
and
at
*NL*
the
end
of
twenty
paces
met
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
having
seen
all
,
was
coming
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
,
presenting
the
billet
to
the
young
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
are
you
sure
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
PARDIEU
,
monsieur
,
I
ca
n't
be
more
sure
.
The
SOUBRETTE
said
,
`
For
your
*NL*
master
.
'
I
have
no
other
master
but
you
;
so
--
a
pretty
little
lass
,
my
*NL*
faith
,
is
that
SOUBRETTE
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
opened
the
letter
,
and
read
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
person
who
takes
more
interest
in
you
than
she
is
willing
to
confess
*NL*
wishes
to
know
on
what
day
it
will
suit
you
to
walk
in
the
forest
?
*NL*
Tomorrow
,
at
the
Hotel
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
,
a
lackey
in
black
and
*NL*
red
will
wait
for
your
reply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
this
is
rather
warm
;
it
appears
that
Milady
and
*NL*
I
are
anxious
about
the
health
of
the
same
person
.
Well
,
Planchet
,
how
*NL*
is
the
good
Monsieur
de
Wardes
?
He
is
not
dead
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monsieur
,
he
is
as
well
as
a
man
can
be
with
four
sword
wounds
in
*NL*
his
body
;
for
you
,
without
question
,
inflicted
four
upon
the
dear
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
he
is
still
very
weak
,
having
lost
almost
all
his
blood
.
*NL*
As
I
said
,
monsieur
,
Lubin
did
not
know
me
,
and
told
me
our
adventure
*NL*
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
Planchet
!
you
are
the
king
of
lackeys
.
Now
jump
onto
your
*NL*
horse
,
and
let
us
overtake
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
take
long
.
At
the
end
of
five
minutes
they
perceived
the
*NL*
carriage
drawn
up
by
the
roadside
;
a
cavalier
,
richly
dressed
,
was
close
*NL*
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
between
Milady
and
the
cavalier
was
so
animated
that
*NL*
d'Artagnan
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
carriage
without
anyone
but
*NL*
the
pretty
SOUBRETTE
perceiving
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
took
place
in
English
--
a
language
which
d'Artagnan
*NL*
could
not
understand
;
but
by
the
accent
the
young
man
plainly
saw
that
*NL*
the
beautiful
Englishwoman
was
in
a
great
rage
.
She
terminated
it
by
an
*NL*
action
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
conversation
;
this
*NL*
was
a
blow
with
her
fan
,
applied
with
such
force
that
the
little
*NL*
feminine
weapon
flew
into
a
thousand
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalier
laughed
aloud
,
which
appeared
to
exasperate
Milady
still
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
thought
this
was
the
moment
to
interfere
.
He
approached
the
*NL*
other
door
,
and
taking
off
his
hat
respectfully
,
said
,
``
Madame
,
will
you
*NL*
permit
me
to
offer
you
my
services
?
It
appears
to
me
that
this
cavalier
*NL*
has
made
you
very
angry
.
Speak
one
word
,
madame
,
and
I
take
upon
myself
*NL*
to
punish
him
for
his
want
of
courtesy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
word
Milady
turned
,
looking
at
the
young
man
with
*NL*
astonishment
;
and
when
he
had
finished
,
she
said
in
very
good
French
,
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
should
with
great
confidence
place
myself
under
your
*NL*
protection
if
the
person
with
whom
I
quarrel
were
not
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
excuse
me
,
then
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
You
must
be
aware
that
I
was
*NL*
ignorant
of
that
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
stupid
fellow
troubling
himself
about
?
''
cried
the
cavalier
*NL*
whom
Milady
had
designated
as
her
brother
,
stooping
down
to
the
height
*NL*
of
the
coach
window
.
``
Why
does
not
he
go
about
his
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupid
fellow
yourself
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
stooping
in
his
turn
on
the
*NL*
neck
of
his
horse
,
and
answering
on
his
side
through
the
carriage
*NL*
window
.
``
I
do
not
go
on
because
it
pleases
me
to
stop
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalier
addressed
some
words
in
English
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
to
you
in
French
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
be
kind
enough
,
then
,
to
*NL*
reply
to
me
in
the
same
language
.
You
are
Madame
's
brother
,
I
learn
--
be
*NL*
it
so
;
but
fortunately
you
are
not
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
thought
that
Milady
,
timid
as
women
are
in
general
,
would
*NL*
have
interposed
in
this
commencement
of
mutual
provocations
in
order
to
*NL*
prevent
the
quarrel
from
going
too
far
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
she
threw
*NL*
herself
back
in
her
carriage
,
and
called
out
coolly
to
the
coachman
,
``
Go
*NL*
on
--
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pretty
SOUBRETTE
cast
an
anxious
glance
at
d'Artagnan
,
whose
good
*NL*
looks
seemed
to
have
made
an
impression
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
went
on
,
and
left
the
two
men
facing
each
other
;
no
*NL*
material
obstacle
separated
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalier
made
a
movement
as
if
to
follow
the
carriage
;
but
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
whose
anger
,
already
excited
,
was
much
increased
by
*NL*
recognizing
in
him
the
Englishman
of
Amiens
who
had
won
his
horse
and
*NL*
had
been
very
near
winning
his
diamond
of
Athos
,
caught
at
his
bridle
*NL*
and
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
appear
to
be
more
stupid
than
I
am
,
for
*NL*
you
forget
there
is
a
little
quarrel
to
arrange
between
us
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the

it
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
reminds
me
that
I

a

take

We

You

the

Do

*NL*
*NL*

I

you

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Needless

said
the

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

replied
d'Artagnan

Where

*NL*
*NL*

Behind

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Marvelous

That

just
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
who
are
you
?
''
asked
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
,
a
Gascon
gentleman
,
serving
in
the
king

*NL*
Musketeers

And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
Lord

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
am
your
servant
,
Monsieur
Baron
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
``
though
you
have
names
rather
difficult
to
recollect
.
''
And
touching
his
*NL*
horse
with
the
spur
,
he
cantered
back
to
Paris
.
As
he
was
accustomed
to
*NL*
do
in
all
cases
of
any
consequence
,
d'Artagnan
went
straight
to
the
*NL*
residence
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Athos
reclining
upon
a
large
sofa
,
where
he
was
waiting
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
for
his
outfit
to
come
and
find
him
.
He
related
to
Athos
all
that
*NL*
had
passed
,
except
the
letter
to
M.
de
Wardes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
was
delighted
to
find
he
was
going
to
fight
an
Englishman
.
We
*NL*
might
say
that
was
his
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
immediately
sent
their
lackeys
for
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
and
on
their
*NL*
arrival
made
them
acquainted
with
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
drew
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
,
and
made
passes
at
the
wall
,
*NL*
springing
back
from
time
to
time
,
and
making
contortions
like
a
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
who
was
constantly
at
work
at
his
poem
,
shut
himself
up
in
*NL*
Athos
's
closet
,
and
begged
not
to
be
disturbed
before
the
moment
of
*NL*
drawing
swords
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
by
signs
,
desired
Grimaud
to
bring
another
bottle
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
employed
himself
in
arranging
a
little
plan
,
of
which
we
*NL*
shall
hereafter
see
the
execution
,
and
which
promised
him
some
agreeable
*NL*
adventure
,
as
might
be
seen
by
the
smiles
which
from
time
to
time
passed
*NL*
over
his
countenance
,
whose
thoughtfulness
they
animated
.

ENGLISH
AND
FRENCH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
having
come
,
they
went
with
their
four
lackeys
to
a
spot
behind
*NL*
the
Luxembourg
given
up
to
the
feeding
of
goats
.
Athos
threw
a
piece
of
*NL*
money
to
the
goatkeeper
to
withdraw
.
The
lackeys
were
ordered
to
act
as
*NL*
sentinels
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silent
party
soon
drew
near
to
the
same
enclosure
,
entered
,
and
joined
*NL*
the
Musketeers
.
Then
,
according
to
foreign
custom
,
the
presentations
*NL*
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishmen
were
all
men
of
rank
;
consequently
the
odd
names
of
their
*NL*
adversaries
were
for
them
not
only
a
matter
of
surprise
,
but
of
*NL*
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
when
the
three
friends
had
been
*NL*
named
,
``
we
do
not
know
who
you
are
.
We
can
not
fight
with
such
names
;
*NL*
they
are
names
of
shepherds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
your
lordship
may
suppose
they
are
only
assumed
names
,
''
said
*NL*
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
only
gives
us
a
greater
desire
to
know
the
real
ones
,
''
replied
*NL*
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
played
very
willingly
with
us
without
knowing
our
names
,
''
said
*NL*
Athos
,
``
by
the
same
token
that
you
won
our
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
but
we
then
only
risked
our
pistoles
;
this
time
we
risk
*NL*
our
blood
.
One
plays
with
anybody
;
but
one
fights
only
with
equals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
but
just
,
''
said
Athos
,
and
he
took
aside
the
one
of
the
*NL*
four
Englishmen
with
whom
he
was
to
fight
,
and
communicated
his
name
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
did
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
satisfy
you
?
''
said
Athos
to
his
adversary
.
``
Do
you
find
me
of
*NL*
sufficient
rank
to
do
me
the
honor
of
crossing
swords
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
now
shall
I
tell
you
something
?
''
added
Athos
,
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
replied
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
is
that
you
would
have
acted
much
more
wisely
if
you
had
not
*NL*
required
me
to
make
myself
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
believed
to
be
dead
,
and
have
reasons
for
wishing
nobody
*NL*
to
know
I
am
living
;
so
that
I
shall
be
obliged
to
kill
you
to
prevent
*NL*
my
secret
from
roaming
over
the
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
looked
at
Athos
,
believing
that
he
jested
,
but
Athos
did
*NL*
not
jest
the
least
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
addressing
at
the
same
time
his
companions
and
*NL*
their
adversaries
,
``
are
we
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
answered
the
Englishmen
and
the
Frenchmen
,
as
with
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
guard
,
then
!
''
cried
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
eight
swords
glittered
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
,
and
*NL*
the
combat
began
with
an
animosity
very
natural
between
men
twice
*NL*
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
fenced
with
as
much
calmness
and
method
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
practicing
in
a
fencing
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
abated
,
no
doubt
,
of
his
too-great
confidence
by
his
adventure
*NL*
of
Chantilly
,
played
with
skill
and
prudence
.
Aramis
,
who
had
the
third
*NL*
canto
of
his
poem
to
finish
,
behaved
like
a
man
in
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
killed
his
adversary
first
.
He
hit
him
but
once
,
but
as
he
had
*NL*
foretold
,
that
hit
was
a
mortal
one
;
the
sword
pierced
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Second
,
Porthos
stretched
his
upon
the
grass
with
a
wound
through
his
*NL*
thigh
.
As
the
Englishman
,
without
making
any
further
resistance
,
then
*NL*
surrendered
his
sword
,
Porthos
took
him
up
in
his
arms
and
bore
him
to
*NL*
his
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
pushed
his
so
vigorously
that
after
going
back
fifty
paces
,
the
*NL*
man
ended
by
fairly
taking
to
his
heels
,
and
disappeared
amid
the
*NL*
hooting
of
the
lackeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
d'Artagnan
,
he
fought
purely
and
simply
on
the
defensive
;
and
when
*NL*
he
saw
his
adversary
pretty
well
fatigued
,
with
a
vigorous
side
thrust
*NL*
sent
his
sword
flying
.
The
baron
,
finding
himself
disarmed
,
took
two
or
*NL*
three
steps
back
,
but
in
this
movement
his
foot
slipped
and
he
fell
*NL*
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
over
him
at
a
bound
,
and
said
to
the
Englishman
,
pointing
*NL*
his
sword
to
his
throat
,
``
I
could
kill
you
,
my
Lord
,
you
are
completely
*NL*
in
my
hands
;
but
I
spare
your
life
for
the
sake
of
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
at
the
height
of
joy
;
he
had
realized
the
plan
he
had
*NL*
imagined
beforehand
,
whose
picturing
had
produced
the
smiles
we
noted
*NL*
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
,
delighted
at
having
to
do
with
a
gentleman
of
such
a
*NL*
kind
disposition
,
pressed
d'Artagnan
in
his
arms
,
and
paid
a
thousand
*NL*
compliments
to
the
three
Musketeers
,
and
as
Porthos
's
adversary
was
*NL*
already
installed
in
the
carriage
,
and
as
Aramis
's
had
taken
to
his
*NL*
heels
,
they
had
nothing
to
think
about
but
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Porthos
and
Aramis
were
undressing
him
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
his
*NL*
wound
not
mortal
,
a
large
purse
dropped
from
his
clothes
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
picked
it
up
and
offered
it
to
Lord
de
Winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
would
you
have
me
do
with
that
?
''
said
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
restore
it
to
his
family
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
family
will
care
much
about
such
a
trifle
as
that
!
His
family
will
*NL*
inherit
fifteen
thousand
louis
a
year
from
him
.
Keep
the
purse
for
your
*NL*
lackeys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
put
the
purse
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
young
friend
,
for
you
will
permit
me
,
I
hope
,
to
give
you
*NL*
that
name
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
on
this
very
evening
,
if
agreeable
to
*NL*
you
,
I
will
present
you
to
my
sister
,
Milady
Clarik
,
for
I
am
desirous
*NL*
that
she
should
take
you
into
her
good
graces
;
and
as
she
is
not
in
bad
*NL*
odor
at
court
,
she
may
perhaps
on
some
future
day
speak
a
word
that
will
*NL*
not
prove
useless
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
blushed
with
pleasure
,
and
bowed
a
sign
of
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
Athos
came
up
to
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
to
do
with
that
purse
?
''
whispered
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
meant
to
pass
it
over
to
you
,
my
dear
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
why
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
killed
him
!
They
are
the
spoils
of
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
the
heir
of
an
enemy
!
''
said
Athos
;
``
for
whom
,
then
,
do
you
take
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
custom
in
war
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
why
should
it
not
be
the
*NL*
custom
in
a
duel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
on
the
field
of
battle
,
I
have
never
done
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
shrugged
his
shoulders
;
Aramis
by
a
movement
of
his
lips
*NL*
endorsed
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
let
us
give
the
money
to
the
lackeys
,
as
Lord
*NL*
de
Winter
desired
us
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
let
us
give
the
money
to
the
lackeys
--
not
to
our
*NL*
lackeys
,
but
to
the
lackeys
of
the
Englishmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
the
purse
,
and
threw
it
into
the
hand
of
the
coachman
.
``
For
*NL*
you
and
your
comrades
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
greatness
of
spirit
in
a
man
who
was
quite
destitute
struck
even
*NL*
Porthos
;
and
this
French
generosity
,
repeated
by
Lord
de
Winter
and
his
*NL*
friend
,
was
highly
applauded
,
except
by
MM
Grimaud
,
Bazin
,
Mousqueton
*NL*
and
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
,
on
quitting
d'Artagnan
,
gave
him
his
sister
's
address
.
*NL*
She
lived
in
the
Place
Royale
--
then
the
fashionable
quarter
--
at
Number
*NL*
6
,
and
he
undertook
to
call
and
take
d'Artagnan
with
him
in
order
to
*NL*
introduce
him
.
D'Artagnan
appointed
eight
o'clock
at
Athos
's
residence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
introduction
to
Milady
Clarik
occupied
the
head
of
our
Gascon
*NL*
greatly
.
He
remembered
in
what
a
strange
manner
this
woman
had
hitherto
*NL*
been
mixed
up
in
his
destiny
.
According
to
his
conviction
,
she
was
some
*NL*
creature
of
the
cardinal
,
and
yet
he
felt
himself
invincibly
drawn
*NL*
toward
her
by
one
of
those
sentiments
for
which
we
can
not
account
.
His
*NL*
only
fear
was
that
Milady
would
recognize
in
him
the
man
of
Meung
and
of
*NL*
Dover
.
Then
she
knew
that
he
was
one
of
the
friends
of
M.
de
Treville
,
*NL*
and
consequently
,
that
he
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
king
;
which
*NL*
would
make
him
lose
a
part
of
his
advantage
,
since
when
known
to
Milady
*NL*
as
he
knew
her
,
he
played
only
an
equal
game
with
her
.
As
to
the
*NL*
commencement
of
an
intrigue
between
her
and
M.
de
Wardes
,
our
*NL*
presumptuous
hero
gave
but
little
heed
to
that
,
although
the
marquis
was
*NL*
young
,
handsome
,
rich
,
and
high
in
the
cardinal
's
favor
.
It
is
not
for
*NL*
nothing
we
are
but
twenty
years
old
,
above
all
if
we
were
born
at
*NL*
Tarbes
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
began
by
making
his
most
splendid
toilet
,
then
returned
to
*NL*
Athos
's
,
and
according
to
custom
,
related
everything
to
him
.
Athos
*NL*
listened
to
his
projects
,
then
shook
his
head
,
and
recommended
prudence
*NL*
to
him
with
a
shade
of
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
he
,
``
you
have
just
lost
one
woman
,
whom
you
call
good
,
*NL*
charming
,
perfect
;
and
here
you
are
,
running
headlong
after
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
felt
the
truth
of
this
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
Madame
Bonacieux
with
my
heart
,
while
I
only
love
Milady
with
*NL*
my
head
,
''
said
he
.
``
In
getting
introduced
to
her
,
my
principal
object
is
*NL*
to
ascertain
what
part
she
plays
at
court
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
part
she
plays
,
PARDIEU
!
It
is
not
difficult
to
divine
that
,
after
*NL*
all
you
have
told
me
.
She
is
some
emissary
of
the
cardinal
;
a
woman
who
*NL*
will
draw
you
into
a
snare
in
which
you
will
leave
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
my
dear
Athos
,
you
view
things
on
the
dark
side
,
methinks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
mistrust
women
.
Can
it
be
otherwise
?
I
bought
my
*NL*
experience
dearly
--
particularly
fair
women
.
Milady
is
fair
,
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
the
most
beautiful
light
hair
imaginable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
poor
d'Artagnan
!
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
!
I
want
to
be
enlightened
on
a
subject
;
then
,
when
I
shall
*NL*
have
learned
what
I
desire
to
know
,
I
will
withdraw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
enlightened
!
''
said
Athos
,
phlegmatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
arrived
at
the
appointed
time
;
but
Athos
,
being
warned
of
*NL*
his
coming
,
went
into
the
other
chamber
.
He
therefore
found
d'Artagnan
*NL*
alone
,
and
as
it
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
he
took
the
young
man
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
elegant
carriage
waited
below
,
and
as
it
was
drawn
by
two
excellent
*NL*
horses
,
they
were
soon
at
the
Place
Royale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
Clarik
received
d'Artagnan
ceremoniously
.
Her
hotel
was
*NL*
remarkably
sumptuous
,
and
while
the
most
part
of
the
English
had
quit
,
*NL*
or
were
about
to
quit
,
France
on
account
of
the
war
,
Milady
had
just
*NL*
been
laying
out
much
money
upon
her
residence
;
which
proved
that
the
*NL*
general
measure
which
drove
the
English
from
France
did
not
affect
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
presenting
d'Artagnan
to
his
sister
,
``
a
*NL*
young
gentleman
who
has
held
my
life
in
his
hands
,
and
who
has
not
*NL*
abused
his
advantage
,
although
we
have
been
twice
enemies
,
although
it
*NL*
was
I
who
insulted
him
,
and
although
I
am
an
Englishman
.
Thank
him
,
*NL*
then
,
madame
,
if
you
have
any
affection
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
frowned
slightly
;
a
scarcely
visible
cloud
passed
over
her
brow
,
*NL*
and
so
peculiar
a
smile
appeared
upon
her
lips
that
the
young
man
,
who
*NL*
saw
and
observed
this
triple
shade
,
almost
shuddered
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brother
did
not
perceive
this
;
he
had
turned
round
to
play
with
*NL*
Milady
's
favorite
monkey
,
which
had
pulled
him
by
the
doublet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
welcome
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
a
voice
whose
singular
*NL*
sweetness
contrasted
with
the
symptoms
of
ill-humor
which
d'Artagnan
had
*NL*
just
remarked
;
``
you
have
today
acquired
eternal
rights
to
my
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Englishman
then
turned
round
and
described
the
combat
without
*NL*
omitting
a
single
detail
.
Milady
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
,
*NL*
and
yet
it
was
easily
to
be
perceived
,
whatever
effort
she
made
to
*NL*
conceal
her
impressions
,
that
this
recital
was
not
agreeable
to
her
.
The
*NL*
blood
rose
to
her
head
,
and
her
little
foot
worked
with
impatience
*NL*
beneath
her
robe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
perceived
nothing
of
this
.
When
he
had
finished
,
he
went
*NL*
to
a
table
upon
which
was
a
salver
with
Spanish
wine
and
glasses
.
He
*NL*
filled
two
glasses
,
and
by
a
sign
invited
d'Artagnan
to
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
knew
it
was
considered
disobliging
by
an
Englishman
to
refuse
*NL*
to
pledge
him
.
He
therefore
drew
near
to
the
table
and
took
the
second
*NL*
glass
.
He
did
not
,
however
,
lose
sight
of
Milady
,
and
in
a
mirror
he
*NL*
perceived
the
change
that
came
over
her
face
.
Now
that
she
believed
*NL*
herself
to
be
no
longer
observed
,
a
sentiment
resembling
ferocity
*NL*
animated
her
countenance
.
She
bit
her
handkerchief
with
her
beautiful
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
pretty
little
SOUBRETTE
whom
d'Artagnan
had
already
observed
then
*NL*
came
in
.
She
spoke
some
words
to
Lord
de
Winter
in
English
,
who
*NL*
thereupon
requested
d'Artagnan
's
permission
to
retire
,
excusing
himself
*NL*
on
account
of
the
urgency
of
the
business
that
had
called
him
away
,
and
*NL*
charging
his
sister
to
obtain
his
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
exchanged
a
shake
of
the
hand
with
Lord
de
Winter
,
and
then
*NL*
returned
to
Milady
.
Her
countenance
,
with
surprising
mobility
,
had
*NL*
recovered
its
gracious
expression
;
but
some
little
red
spots
on
her
*NL*
handkerchief
indicated
that
she
had
bitten
her
lips
till
the
blood
came
.
*NL*
Those
lips
were
magnificent
;
they
might
be
said
to
be
of
coral
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
took
a
cheerful
turn
.
Milady
appeared
to
have
entirely
*NL*
recovered
.
She
told
d'Artagnan
that
Lord
de
Winter
was
her
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
and
not
her
brother
.
She
had
married
a
younger
brother
*NL*
of
the
family
,
who
had
left
her
a
widow
with
one
child
.
This
child
was
*NL*
the
only
heir
to
Lord
de
Winter
,
if
Lord
de
Winter
did
not
marry
.
All
*NL*
this
showed
d'Artagnan
that
there
was
a
veil
which
concealed
something
;
*NL*
but
he
could
not
yet
see
under
this
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
,
after
a
half
hour
's
conversation
d'Artagnan
was
*NL*
convinced
that
Milady
was
his
compatriot
;
she
spoke
French
with
an
*NL*
elegance
and
a
purity
that
left
no
doubt
on
that
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
profuse
in
gallant
speeches
and
protestations
of
*NL*
devotion
.
To
all
the
simple
things
which
escaped
our
Gascon
,
Milady
*NL*
replied
with
a
smile
of
kindness
.
The
hour
came
for
him
to
retire
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
leave
of
Milady
,
and
left
the
saloon
the
happiest
of
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
staircase
he
met
the
pretty
SOUBRETTE
,
who
brushed
gently
against
*NL*
him
as
she
passed
,
and
then
,
blushing
to
the
eyes
,
asked
his
pardon
for
*NL*
having
touched
him
in
a
voice
so
sweet
that
the
pardon
was
granted
*NL*
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
came
again
on
the
morrow
,
and
was
still
better
received
than
*NL*
on
the
evening
before
.
Lord
de
Winter
was
not
at
home
;
and
it
was
Milady
*NL*
who
this
time
did
all
the
honors
of
the
evening
.
She
appeared
to
take
a
*NL*
great
interest
in
him
,
asked
him
whence
he
came
,
who
were
his
friends
,
*NL*
and
whether
he
had
not
sometimes
thought
of
attaching
himself
to
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
exceedingly
prudent
for
a
young
*NL*
man
of
twenty
,
then
remembered
his
suspicions
regarding
Milady
.
He
*NL*
launched
into
a
eulogy
of
his
Eminence
,
and
said
that
he
should
not
have
*NL*
failed
to
enter
into
the
Guards
of
the
cardinal
instead
of
the
king
's
*NL*
Guards
if
he
had
happened
to
know
M.
de
Cavois
instead
of
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
changed
the
conversation
without
any
appearance
of
affectation
,
*NL*
and
asked
d'Artagnan
in
the
most
careless
manner
possible
if
he
had
ever
*NL*
been
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
replied
that
he
had
been
sent
thither
by
M.
de
Treville
to
*NL*
treat
for
a
supply
of
horses
,
and
that
he
had
brought
back
four
as
*NL*
specimens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
twice
or
thrice
bit
her
lips
;
*NL*
she
had
to
deal
with
a
Gascon
who
played
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
hour
as
on
the
preceding
evening
,
d'Artagnan
retired
.
In
the
*NL*
corridor
he
again
met
the
pretty
Kitty
;
that
was
the
name
of
the
*NL*
SOUBRETTE
.
She
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
kindness
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
mistake
;
but
d'Artagnan
was
so
preoccupied
by
the
mistress
*NL*
that
he
noticed
absolutely
nothing
but
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
came
again
on
the
morrow
and
the
day
after
that
,
and
each
day
*NL*
Milady
gave
him
a
more
gracious
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
evening
,
either
in
the
antechamber
,
the
corridor
,
or
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
he
met
the
pretty
SOUBRETTE
.
But
,
as
we
have
said
,
d'Artagnan
*NL*
paid
no
attention
to
this
persistence
of
poor
Kitty
.
*NL*

A
PROCURATOR
'S
DINNER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
However
brilliant
had
been
the
part
played
by
Porthos
in
the
duel
,
it
*NL*
had
not
made
him
forget
the
dinner
of
the
procurator
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
he
received
the
last
touches
of
Mousqueton
's
brush
for
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
took
his
way
toward
the
Rue
aux
Ours
with
the
steps
of
a
man
*NL*
who
was
doubly
in
favor
with
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
beat
,
but
not
like
d'Artagnan
's
with
a
young
and
impatient
*NL*
love
.
No
;
a
more
material
interest
stirred
his
blood
.
He
was
about
at
*NL*
last
to
pass
that
mysterious
threshold
,
to
climb
those
unknown
stairs
by
*NL*
which
,
one
by
one
,
the
old
crowns
of
M.
Coquenard
had
ascended
.
He
was
*NL*
about
to
see
in
reality
a
certain
coffer
of
which
he
had
twenty
times
*NL*
beheld
the
image
in
his
dreams
--
a
coffer
long
and
deep
,
locked
,
bolted
,
*NL*
fastened
in
the
wall
;
a
coffer
of
which
he
had
so
often
heard
,
and
which
*NL*
the
hands
--
a
little
wrinkled
,
it
is
true
,
but
still
not
without
*NL*
elegance
--
of
the
procurator
's
wife
were
about
to
open
to
his
admiring
*NL*
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
--
a
wanderer
on
the
earth
,
a
man
without
fortune
,
a
man
*NL*
without
family
,
a
soldier
accustomed
to
inns
,
cabarets
,
taverns
,
and
*NL*
restaurants
,
a
lover
of
wine
forced
to
depend
upon
chance
treats
--
was
*NL*
about
to
partake
of
family
meals
,
to
enjoy
the
pleasures
of
a
*NL*
comfortable
establishment
,
and
to
give
himself
up
to
those
little
*NL*
attentions
which
``
the
harder
one
is
,
the
more
they
please
,
''
as
old
*NL*
soldiers
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
come
in
the
capacity
of
a
cousin
,
and
seat
himself
every
day
at
a
*NL*
good
table
;
to
smooth
the
yellow
,
wrinkled
brow
of
the
old
procurator
;
*NL*
to
pluck
the
clerks
a
little
by
teaching
them
BASSETTE
,
PASSE-DIX
,
and
*NL*
LANSQUENET
,
in
their
utmost
nicety
,
and
winning
from
them
,
by
way
of
fee
*NL*
for
the
lesson
he
would
give
them
in
an
hour
,
their
savings
of
a
*NL*
month
--
all
this
was
enormously
delightful
to
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musketeer
could
not
forget
the
evil
reports
which
then
prevailed
,
*NL*
and
which
indeed
have
survived
them
,
of
the
procurators
of
the
*NL*
period
--
meanness
,
stinginess
,
fasts
;
but
as
,
after
all
,
excepting
some
*NL*
few
acts
of
economy
which
Porthos
had
always
found
very
unseasonable
,
*NL*
the
procurator
's
wife
had
been
tolerably
liberal
--
that
is
,
be
it
*NL*
understood
,
for
a
procurator
's
wife
--
he
hoped
to
see
a
household
of
a
*NL*
highly
comfortable
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
at
the
very
door
the
Musketeer
began
to
entertain
some
doubts
.
*NL*
The
approach
was
not
such
as
to
prepossess
people
--
an
ill-smelling
,
dark
*NL*
passage
,
a
staircase
half-lighted
by
bars
through
which
stole
a
glimmer
*NL*
from
a
neighboring
yard
;
on
the
first
floor
a
low
door
studded
with
*NL*
enormous
nails
,
like
the
principal
gate
of
the
Grand
Chatelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
knocked
with
his
hand
.
A
tall
,
pale
clerk
,
his
face
shaded
by
a
*NL*
forest
of
virgin
hair
,
opened
the
door
,
and
bowed
with
the
air
of
a
man
*NL*
forced
at
once
to
respect
in
another
lofty
stature
,
which
indicated
*NL*
strength
,
the
military
dress
,
which
indicated
rank
,
and
a
ruddy
*NL*
countenance
,
which
indicated
familiarity
with
good
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shorter
clerk
came
behind
the
first
,
a
taller
clerk
behind
the
second
,
*NL*
a
stripling
of
a
dozen
years
rising
behind
the
third
.
In
all
,
three
*NL*
clerks
and
a
half
,
which
,
for
the
time
,
argued
a
very
extensive
*NL*
clientage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
Musketeer
was
not
expected
before
one
o'clock
,
the
*NL*
procurator
's
wife
had
been
on
the
watch
ever
since
midday
,
reckoning
*NL*
that
the
heart
,
or
perhaps
the
stomach
,
of
her
lover
would
bring
him
*NL*
before
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
therefore
entered
the
office
from
the
house
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
her
guest
entered
from
the
stairs
,
and
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
worthy
lady
relieved
him
from
an
awkward
embarrassment
.
The
clerks
*NL*
surveyed
him
with
great
curiosity
,
and
he
,
not
knowing
well
what
to
say
*NL*
to
this
ascending
and
descending
scale
,
remained
tongue-tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
my
cousin
!
''
cried
the
procurator
's
wife
.
``
Come
in
,
come
in
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Porthos
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Porthos
produced
its
effect
upon
the
clerks
,
who
began
to
*NL*
laugh
;
but
Porthos
turned
sharply
round
,
and
every
countenance
quickly
*NL*
recovered
its
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
office
of
the
procurator
after
having
passed
through
*NL*
the
antechamber
in
which
the
clerks
were
,
and
the
study
in
which
they
*NL*
ought
to
have
been
.
This
last
apartment
was
a
sort
of
dark
room
,
*NL*
littered
with
papers
.
On
quitting
the
study
they
left
the
kitchen
on
the
*NL*
right
,
and
entered
the
reception
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
rooms
,
which
communicated
with
one
another
,
did
not
inspire
*NL*
Porthos
favorably
.
Words
might
be
heard
at
a
distance
through
all
these
*NL*
open
doors
.
Then
,
while
passing
,
he
had
cast
a
rapid
,
investigating
*NL*
glance
into
the
kitchen
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
,
to
*NL*
the
shame
of
the
procurator
's
wife
and
his
own
regret
,
that
he
did
not
*NL*
see
that
fire
,
that
animation
,
that
bustle
,
which
when
a
good
repast
is
*NL*
on
foot
prevails
generally
in
that
sanctuary
of
good
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
had
without
doubt
been
warned
of
his
visit
,
as
he
*NL*
expressed
no
surprise
at
the
sight
of
Porthos
,
who
advanced
toward
him
*NL*
with
a
sufficiently
easy
air
,
and
saluted
him
courteously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
cousins
,
it
appears
,
Monsieur
Porthos
?
''
said
the
procurator
,
*NL*
rising
,
yet
supporting
his
weight
upon
the
arms
of
his
cane
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
wrapped
in
a
large
black
doublet
,
in
which
the
whole
of
his
*NL*
slender
body
was
concealed
,
was
brisk
and
dry
.
His
little
gray
eyes
*NL*
shone
like
carbuncles
,
and
appeared
,
with
his
grinning
mouth
,
to
be
the
*NL*
only
part
of
his
face
in
which
life
survived
.
Unfortunately
the
legs
*NL*
began
to
refuse
their
service
to
this
bony
machine
.
During
the
last
five
*NL*
or
six
months
that
this
weakness
had
been
felt
,
the
worthy
procurator
*NL*
had
nearly
become
the
slave
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cousin
was
received
with
resignation
,
that
was
all
.
M.
Coquenard
,
*NL*
firm
upon
his
legs
,
would
have
declined
all
relationship
with
M.
*NL*
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
we
are
cousins
,
''
said
Porthos
,
without
being
*NL*
disconcerted
,
as
he
had
never
reckoned
upon
being
received
*NL*
enthusiastically
by
the
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
female
side
,
I
believe
?
''
said
the
procurator
,
maliciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
did
not
feel
the
ridicule
of
this
,
and
took
it
for
a
piece
of
*NL*
simplicity
,
at
which
he
laughed
in
his
large
mustache
.
Mme.
Coquenard
,
*NL*
who
knew
that
a
simple-minded
procurator
was
a
very
rare
variety
in
the
*NL*
species
,
smiled
a
little
,
and
colored
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
had
,
since
the
arrival
of
Porthos
,
frequently
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
with
great
uneasiness
upon
a
large
chest
placed
in
front
of
his
oak
*NL*
desk
.
Porthos
comprehended
that
this
chest
,
although
it
did
not
*NL*
correspond
in
shape
with
that
which
he
had
seen
in
his
dreams
,
must
be
*NL*
the
blessed
coffer
,
and
he
congratulated
himself
that
the
reality
was
*NL*
several
feet
higher
than
the
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
did
not
carry
his
genealogical
investigations
any
further
;
*NL*
but
withdrawing
his
anxious
look
from
the
chest
and
fixing
it
upon
*NL*
Porthos
,
he
contented
himself
with
saying
,
``
Monsieur
our
cousin
will
do
*NL*
us
the
favor
of
dining
with
us
once
before
his
departure
for
the
*NL*
campaign
,
will
he
not
,
Madame
Coquenard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Porthos
received
the
blow
right
in
his
stomach
,
and
felt
it
.
*NL*
It
appeared
likewise
that
Mme.
Coquenard
was
not
less
affected
by
it
on
*NL*
her
part
,
for
she
added
,
``
My
cousin
will
not
return
if
he
finds
that
we
*NL*
do
not
treat
him
kindly
;
but
otherwise
he
has
so
little
time
to
pass
in
*NL*
Paris
,
and
consequently
to
spare
to
us
,
that
we
must
entreat
him
to
give
*NL*
us
every
instant
he
can
call
his
own
previous
to
his
departure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
legs
,
my
poor
legs
!
where
are
you
?
''
murmured
Coquenard
,
and
he
*NL*
tried
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
succor
,
which
came
to
Porthos
at
the
moment
in
which
he
was
*NL*
attacked
in
his
gastronomic
hopes
,
inspired
much
gratitude
in
the
*NL*
Musketeer
toward
the
procurator
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
of
dinner
soon
arrived
.
They
passed
into
the
eating
room
--
a
*NL*
large
dark
room
situated
opposite
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerks
,
who
,
as
it
appeared
,
had
smelled
unusual
perfumes
in
the
*NL*
house
,
were
of
military
punctuality
,
and
held
their
stools
in
hand
quite
*NL*
ready
to
sit
down
.
Their
jaws
moved
preliminarily
with
fearful
*NL*
threatenings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
thought
Porthos
,
casting
a
glance
at
the
three
hungry
*NL*
clerks
--
for
the
errand
boy
,
as
might
be
expected
,
was
not
admitted
to
*NL*
the
honors
of
the
magisterial
table
,
``
in
my
cousin
's
place
,
I
would
not
*NL*
keep
such
gourmands
!
They
look
like
shipwrecked
sailors
who
have
not
*NL*
eaten
for
six
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
entered
,
pushed
along
upon
his
armchair
with
casters
by
Mme.
*NL*
Coquenard
,
whom
Porthos
assisted
in
rolling
her
husband
up
to
the
table
.
*NL*
He
had
scarcely
entered
when
he
began
to
agitate
his
nose
and
his
jaws
*NL*
after
the
example
of
his
clerks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
said
he
;
``
here
is
a
soup
which
is
rather
inviting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
can
they
smell
so
extraordinary
in
this
soup
?
''
said
*NL*
Porthos
,
at
the
sight
of
a
pale
liquid
,
abundant
but
entirely
free
from
*NL*
meat
,
on
the
surface
of
which
a
few
crusts
swam
about
as
rare
as
the
*NL*
islands
of
an
archipelago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
smiled
,
and
upon
a
sign
from
her
everyone
eagerly
took
*NL*
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
was
served
first
,
then
Porthos
.
Afterward
Mme.
Coquenard
*NL*
filled
her
own
plate
,
and
distributed
the
crusts
without
soup
to
the
*NL*
impatient
clerks
.
At
this
moment
the
door
of
the
dining
room
unclosed
*NL*
with
a
creak
,
and
Porthos
perceived
through
the
half-open
flap
the
*NL*
little
clerk
who
,
not
being
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
feast
,
ate
his
*NL*
dry
bread
in
the
passage
with
the
double
odor
of
the
dining
room
and
*NL*
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
soup
the
maid
brought
a
boiled
fowl
--
a
piece
of
magnificence
*NL*
which
caused
the
eyes
of
the
diners
to
dilate
in
such
a
manner
that
they
*NL*
seemed
ready
to
burst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
may
see
that
you
love
your
family
,
Madame
Coquenard
,
''
said
the
*NL*
procurator
,
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
tragic
.
``
You
are
certainly
*NL*
treating
your
cousin
very
handsomely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fowl
was
thin
,
and
covered
with
one
of
those
thick
,
bristly
*NL*
skins
through
which
the
teeth
can
not
penetrate
with
all
their
efforts
.
*NL*
The
fowl
must
have
been
sought
for
a
long
time
on
the
perch
,
to
which
it
*NL*
had
retired
to
die
of
old
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
thought
Porthos
,
``
this
is
poor
work
.
I
respect
old
age
,
but
*NL*
I
do
n't
much
like
it
boiled
or
roasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
round
to
see
if
anybody
partook
of
his
opinion
;
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
he
saw
nothing
but
eager
eyes
which
were
devouring
,
in
*NL*
anticipation
,
that
sublime
fowl
which
was
the
object
of
his
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
drew
the
dish
toward
her
,
skillfully
detached
the
two
*NL*
great
black
feet
,
which
she
placed
upon
her
husband
's
plate
,
cut
off
the
*NL*
neck
,
which
with
the
head
she
put
on
one
side
for
herself
,
raised
the
*NL*
wing
for
Porthos
,
and
then
returned
the
bird
otherwise
intact
to
the
*NL*
servant
who
had
brought
it
in
,
who
disappeared
with
it
before
the
*NL*
Musketeer
had
time
to
examine
the
variations
which
disappointment
*NL*
produces
upon
faces
,
according
to
the
characters
and
temperaments
of
*NL*
those
who
experience
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
place
of
the
fowl
a
dish
of
haricot
beans
made
its
appearance
--
an
*NL*
enormous
dish
in
which
some
bones
of
mutton
that
at
first
sight
one
*NL*
might
have
believed
to
have
some
meat
on
them
pretended
to
show
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
clerks
were
not
the
dupes
of
this
deceit
,
and
their
lugubrious
*NL*
looks
settled
down
into
resigned
countenances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
distributed
this
dish
to
the
young
men
with
the
*NL*
moderation
of
a
good
housewife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
for
wine
came
.
M.
Coquenard
poured
from
a
very
small
stone
*NL*
bottle
the
third
of
a
glass
for
each
of
the
young
men
,
served
himself
in
*NL*
about
the
same
proportion
,
and
passed
the
bottle
to
Porthos
and
Mme.
*NL*
Coquenard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
filled
up
their
third
of
a
glass
with
water
;
then
,
when
*NL*
they
had
drunk
half
the
glass
,
they
filled
it
up
again
,
and
continued
to
*NL*
do
so
.
This
brought
them
,
by
the
end
of
the
repast
,
to
swallowing
a
*NL*
drink
which
from
the
color
of
the
ruby
had
passed
to
that
of
a
pale
*NL*
topaz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
ate
his
wing
of
the
fowl
timidly
,
and
shuddered
when
he
felt
the
*NL*
knee
of
the
procurator
's
wife
under
the
table
,
as
it
came
in
search
of
*NL*
his
.
He
also
drank
half
a
glass
of
this
sparingly
served
wine
,
and
found
*NL*
it
to
be
nothing
but
that
horrible
Montreuil
--
the
terror
of
all
expert
*NL*
palates
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
saw
him
swallowing
this
wine
undiluted
,
and
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
eat
any
of
these
beans
,
Cousin
Porthos
?
''
said
Mme.
Coquenard
,
*NL*
in
that
tone
which
says
,
``
Take
my
advice
,
do
n't
touch
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Devil
take
me
if
I
taste
one
of
them
!
''
murmured
Porthos
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
then
said
aloud
,
``
Thank
you
,
my
cousin
,
I
am
no
longer
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
Porthos
could
hardly
keep
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
repeated
several
times
,
``
Ah
,
Madame
Coquenard
!
Accept
my
*NL*
compliments
;
your
dinner
has
been
a
real
feast
.
Lord
,
how
I
have
eaten
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
had
eaten
his
soup
,
the
black
feet
of
the
fowl
,
and
the
only
*NL*
mutton
bone
on
which
there
was
the
least
appearance
of
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
fancied
they
were
mystifying
him
,
and
began
to
curl
his
mustache
*NL*
and
knit
his
eyebrows
;
but
the
knee
of
Mme.
Coquenard
gently
advised
him
*NL*
to
be
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
silence
and
this
interruption
in
serving
,
which
were
unintelligible
*NL*
to
Porthos
,
had
,
on
the
contrary
,
a
terrible
meaning
for
the
clerks
.
*NL*
Upon
a
look
from
the
procurator
,
accompanied
by
a
smile
from
Mme.
*NL*
Coquenard
,
they
arose
slowly
from
the
table
,
folded
their
napkins
more
*NL*
slowly
still
,
bowed
,
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
young
men
!
go
and
promote
digestion
by
working
,
''
said
the
*NL*
procurator
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerks
gone
,
Mme.
Coquenard
rose
and
took
from
a
buffet
a
piece
of
*NL*
cheese
,
some
preserved
quinces
,
and
a
cake
which
she
had
herself
made
of
*NL*
almonds
and
honey
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
knit
his
eyebrows
because
there
were
too
many
good
things
.
*NL*
Porthos
bit
his
lips
because
he
saw
not
the
wherewithal
to
dine
.
He
*NL*
looked
to
see
if
the
dish
of
beans
was
still
there
;
the
dish
of
beans
*NL*
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
positive
feast
!
''
cried
M.
Coquenard
,
turning
about
in
his
chair
,
``
a
*NL*
real
feast
,
EPULCE
EPULORUM
.
Lucullus
dines
with
Lucullus

''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
looked
at
the
bottle
,
which
was
near
him
,
and
hoped
that
with
*NL*
wine
,
bread
,
and
cheese
,
he
might
make
a
dinner
;
but
wine
was
wanting
,
*NL*
the
bottle
was
empty
.
M.
and
Mme.
Coquenard
did
not
seem
to
observe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
fine
!
''
said
Porthos
to
himself
;
``
I
am
prettily
caught
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
his
tongue
over
a
spoonful
of
preserves
,
and
stuck
his
teeth
*NL*
into
the
sticky
pastry
of
Mme.
Coquenard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
sacrifice
is
consummated
!
Ah
!
if
I
had
not
the
hope
*NL*
of
peeping
with
Madame
Coquenard
into
her
husband
's
chest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M
Coquenard
,
after
the
luxuries
of
such
a
repast
,
which
he
called
an
*NL*
excess
,
felt
the
want
of
a
siesta
.
Porthos
began
to
hope
that
the
thing
*NL*
would
take
place
at
the
present
sitting
,
and
in
that
same
locality
;
but
*NL*
the
procurator
would
listen
to
nothing
,
he
would
be
taken
to
his
room
,
*NL*
and
was
not
satisfied
till
he
was
close
to
his
chest
,
upon
the
edge
of
*NL*
which
,
for
still
greater
precaution
,
he
placed
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
's
wife
took
Porthos
into
an
adjoining
room
,
and
they
*NL*
began
to
lay
the
basis
of
a
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
come
and
dine
three
times
a
week
,
''
said
Mme.
Coquenard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
madame
!
''
said
Porthos
,
``
but
I
do
n't
like
to
abuse
your
*NL*
kindness
;
besides
,
I
must
think
of
my
outfit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
the
procurator
's
wife
,
groaning
,
``
that
unfortunate
*NL*
outfit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
yes
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
it
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
what
,
then
,
does
the
equipment
of
your
company
consist
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
many
things
!
''
said
Porthos
.
``
The
Musketeers
are
,
as
you
know
,
*NL*
picked
soldiers
,
and
they
require
many
things
useless
to
the
Guardsmen
*NL*
or
the
Swiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
yet
,
detail
them
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
they
may
amount
to

''
,
said
Porthos
,
who
preferred
discussing
the
*NL*
total
to
taking
them
one
by
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
's
wife
waited
tremblingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
how
much
?
''
said
she
.
``
I
hope
it
does
not
exceed
--
''
She
stopped
;
*NL*
speech
failed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
it
does
not
exceed
two
thousand
five
hundred
*NL*
livres
!
I
even
think
that
with
economy
I
could
manage
it
with
two
*NL*
thousand
livres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
she
,
``
two
thousand
livres
!
Why
,
that
is
a
fortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
made
a
most
significant
grimace
;
Mme.
Coquenard
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
know
the
detail
,
''
said
she
,
``
because
,
having
many
relatives
*NL*
in
business
,
I
was
almost
sure
of
obtaining
things
at
a
hundred
per
cent
*NL*
less
than
you
would
pay
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
Porthos
,
``
that
is
what
you
meant
to
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Monsieur
Porthos
.
Thus
,
for
instance
,
do
n't
you
in
the
first
*NL*
place
want
a
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
!
I
can
just
suit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Porthos
,
brightening
,
``
that
's
well
as
regards
my
horse
;
but
I
*NL*
must
have
the
appointments
complete
,
as
they
include
objects
which
a
*NL*
Musketeer
alone
can
purchase
,
and
which
will
not
amount
,
besides
,
to
*NL*
more
than
three
hundred
livres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
livres
?
Then
put
down
three
hundred
livres
,
''
said
the
*NL*
procurator
's
wife
,
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
smiled
.
It
may
be
remembered
that
he
had
the
saddle
which
came
*NL*
from
Buckingham
.
These
three
hundred
livres
he
reckoned
upon
putting
*NL*
snugly
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
continued
he
,
``
there
is
a
horse
for
my
lackey
,
and
my
valise
.
As
*NL*
to
my
arms
,
it
is
useless
to
trouble
you
about
them
;
I
have
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
horse
for
your
lackey
?
''
resumed
the
procurator
's
wife
,
hesitatingly
;
*NL*
``
but
that
is
doing
things
in
lordly
style
,
my
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
madame
!
''
said
Porthos
,
haughtily
;
``
do
you
take
me
for
a
beggar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
only
thought
that
a
pretty
mule
makes
sometimes
as
good
an
*NL*
appearance
as
a
horse
,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
getting
a
pretty
mule
*NL*
for
Mousqueton
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
agreed
for
a
pretty
mule
,
''
said
Porthos
;
``
you
are
right
,
I
have
*NL*
seen
very
great
Spanish
nobles
whose
whole
suite
were
mounted
on
mules
.
*NL*
But
then
you
understand
,
Madame
Coquenard
,
a
mule
with
feathers
and
*NL*
bells
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
,
''
said
the
procurator
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
remains
the
valise
,
''
added
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
let
that
disturb
you
,

cried
Mme.
Coquenard
.
``
My
husband
has
*NL*
five
or
six
valises
;
you
shall
choose
the
best
.
There
is
one
in
*NL*
particular
which
he
prefers
in
his
journeys
,
large
enough
to
hold
all
*NL*
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
valise
is
then
empty
?
''
asked
Porthos
,
with
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
it
is
empty
,
''
replied
the
procurator
's
wife
,
in
real
*NL*
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
the
valise
I
want
,
''
cried
Porthos
,
``
is
a
well-filled
one
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
uttered
fresh
sighs
.
Moliere
had
not
written
his
scene
in
*NL*
``
L'Avare
''
then
.
Mme.
Coquenard
was
in
the
dilemma
of
Harpagan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
rest
of
the
equipment
was
successively
debated
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
;
and
the
result
of
the
sitting
was
that
the
procurator
's
wife
*NL*
should
give
eight
hundred
livres
in
money
,
and
should
furnish
the
horse
*NL*
and
the
mule
which
should
have
the
honor
of
carrying
Porthos
and
*NL*
Mousqueton
to
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
conditions
being
agreed
to
,
Porthos
took
leave
of
Mme.
Coquenard
.
*NL*
The
latter
wished
to
detain
him
by
darting
certain
tender
glances
;
but
*NL*
Porthos
urged
the
commands
of
duty
,
and
the
procurator
's
wife
was
*NL*
obliged
to
give
place
to
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musketeer
returned
home
hungry
and
in
bad
humor
.

SOUBRETTE
AND
MISTRESS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
as
we
have
said
,
despite
the
cries
of
his
conscience
and
the
*NL*
wise
counsels
of
Athos
,
d'Artagnan
became
hourly
more
in
love
with
*NL*
Milady
.
Thus
he
never
failed
to
pay
his
diurnal
court
to
her
;
and
the
*NL*
self-satisfied
Gascon
was
convinced
that
sooner
or
later
she
could
not
*NL*
fail
to
respond
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
he
arrived
with
his
head
in
the
air
,
and
as
light
at
heart
*NL*
as
a
man
who
awaits
a
shower
of
gold
,
he
found
the
SOUBRETTE
under
the
*NL*
gateway
of
the
hotel
;
but
this
time
the
pretty
Kitty
was
not
contented
*NL*
with
touching
him
as
he
passed
,
she
took
him
gently
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
thought
d'Artagnan
,
``
She
is
charged
with
some
message
for
me
*NL*
from
her
mistress
;
she
is
about
to
appoint
some
rendezvous
of
which
she
*NL*
had
not
courage
to
speak
.
''
And
he
looked
down
at
the
pretty
girl
with
*NL*
the
most
triumphant
air
imaginable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
say
three
words
to
you
,
Monsieur
Chevalier
,
''
stammered
the
*NL*
SOUBRETTE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
my
child
,
speak
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
?
Impossible
!
That
which
I
have
to
say
is
too
long
,
and
above
all
,
*NL*
too
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Monsieur
Chevalier
would
follow
me
?
''
said
Kitty
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
please
,
my
dear
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Kitty
,
who
had
not
let
go
the
hand
of
d'Artagnan
,
led
him
up
a
*NL*
little
dark
,
winding
staircase
,
and
after
ascending
about
fifteen
steps
,
*NL*
opened
a
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
here
,
Monsieur
Chevalier
,
''
said
she
;
``
here
we
shall
be
alone
,
*NL*
and
can
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whose
room
is
this
,
my
dear
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
mine
,
Monsieur
Chevalier
;
it
communicates
with
my
mistress
's
by
*NL*
that
door
.
But
you
need
not
fear
.
She
will
not
hear
what
we
say
;
she
*NL*
never
goes
to
bed
before
midnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
cast
a
glance
around
him
.
The
little
apartment
was
charming
*NL*
for
its
taste
and
neatness
;
but
in
spite
of
himself
,
his
eyes
were
*NL*
directed
to
that
door
which
Kitty
said
led
to
Milady
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
guessed
what
was
passing
in
the
mind
of
the
young
man
,
and
heaved
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
my
mistress
,
then
,
very
dearly
,
Monsieur
Chevalier
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
more
than
I
can
say
,
Kitty
!
I
am
mad
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
breathed
a
second
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
monsieur
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
is
too
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
do
you
see
so
bad
in
it
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
monsieur
,
''
replied
Kitty
,
``
my
mistress
loves
you
not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
HEIN
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
can
she
have
charged
you
to
tell
me
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
monsieur
;
but
out
of
the
regard
I
have
for
you

I
have
taken
*NL*
the
resolution
to
tell
you
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
obliged

Kitty

intention

not
likely
to
be
at

agreeable

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
always
some
difficulty

pretty

were
it
only
from
self-love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
believe
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess

some
proof

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
drew
a
little
note
from
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
seizing
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

for
another

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
His

cried
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Read

``

*NL*
The
remembrance
of
the
scene
at
St.
Germain
presented
itself
to
the
mind
*NL*
of
the
presumptuous
Gascon
.
As
quick
as
thought
,
he
tore
open
the
*NL*
letter
,
in
spite
of
the
cry
which
Kitty
uttered
on
seeing
what
he
was
*NL*
going
to
do
,
or
rather
,
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

good
Lord

Monsieur
Chevalier

said
she
,
``
what
are
you
doing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
d'Artagnan
;
``
nothing

and
he
read
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
answered
my
first
note

You

opportunity

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
became
very
pale
;
he
was
wounded
in
his
SELF-love
:
he
thought
*NL*
that
it
was
in
his
LOVE
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dear
Monsieur
d'Artagnan

said
Kitty
,
in
a
voice
full
of
*NL*
compassion
,
and
pressing
anew
the
young
man
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pity
me

little
one

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*

much
attention

yes

*NL*
``
Well

And

warmly

``
And

demanded
d'Artagnan

``
For

reasons

D'Artagnan
looked
at
Kitty
for
the
second
time

The
young
girl
had
*NL*
freshness

beauty

coronets

Kitty
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
read
to
the
bottom
of
your
soul
when-ever
you
*NL*
like
;
do
n't
let
that
disturb
you
.
''
And
he
gave
her
a
kiss
at
which
the
*NL*
poor
girl
became
as
red
as
a
cherry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Kitty
,
``
it
is
not
me
you
love
!
It
is
my
mistress
you
*NL*
love
;
you
told
me
so
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
that
hinder
you
from
letting
me
know
the
second
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
second
reason
,
Monsieur
the
Chevalier
,
''
replied
Kitty
,
emboldened
*NL*
by
the
kiss
in
the
first
place
,
and
still
further
by
the
expression
of
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
young
man
,
``
is
that
in
love
,
everyone
for
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
only
d'Artagnan
remembered
the
languishing
glances
of
Kitty
,
her
*NL*
constantly
meeting
him
in
the
antechamber
,
the
corridor
,
or
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
those
touches
of
the
hand
every
time
she
met
him
,
and
her
deep
*NL*
sighs
;
but
absorbed
by
his
desire
to
please
the
great
lady
,
he
had
*NL*
disdained
the
soubrette
.
He
whose
game
is
the
eagle
takes
no
heed
of
the
*NL*
sparrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
our
Gascon
saw
at
a
glance
all
the
advantage
to
be
derived
*NL*
from
the
love
which
Kitty
had
just
confessed
so
innocently
,
or
so
*NL*
boldly
:
the
interception
of
letters
addressed
to
the
Comte
de
Wardes
,
*NL*
news
on
the
spot
,
entrance
at
all
hours
into
Kitty
's
chamber
,
which
was
*NL*
contiguous
to
her
mistress
's
.
The
perfidious
deceiver
was
,
as
may
*NL*
plainly
be
perceived
,
already
sacrificing
,
in
intention
,
the
poor
girl
*NL*
in
order
to
obtain
Milady
,
willy-nilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
to
the
young
girl
,
``
are
you
willing
,
my
dear
Kitty
,
that
*NL*
I
should
give
you
a
proof
of
that
love
which
you
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
love
?
''
asked
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
which
I
am
ready
to
feel
toward
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
that
proof
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
willing
that
I
should
this
evening
pass
with
you
the
time
I
*NL*
generally
spend
with
your
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Kitty
,
clapping
her
hands
,
``
very
willing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
come
here
,
my
dear
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
establishing
himself
*NL*
in
an
easy
chair
;
``
come
,
and
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
the
prettiest
*NL*
SOUBRETTE
I
ever
saw
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
tell
her
so
much
,
and
so
well
,
that
the
poor
girl
,
who
asked
*NL*
nothing
better
than
to
believe
him
,
did
believe
him
.
Nevertheless
,
to
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
great
astonishment
,
the
pretty
Kitty
defended
herself
*NL*
resolutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
passes
quickly
when
it
is
passed
in
attacks
and
defenses
.
Midnight
*NL*
sounded
,
and
almost
at
the
same
time
the
bell
was
rung
in
Milady
's
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
''
cried
Kitty
,
``
there
is
my
mistress
calling
me
!
Go
;
go
*NL*
directly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
rose
,
took
his
hat
,
as
if
it
had
been
his
intention
to
obey
,
*NL*
then
,
opening
quickly
the
door
of
a
large
closet
instead
of
that
leading
*NL*
to
the
staircase
,
he
buried
himself
amid
the
robes
and
dressing
gowns
of
*NL*
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
cried
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
had
secured
the
key
,
shut
himself
up
in
the
closet
*NL*
without
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
cried
Milady
,
in
a
sharp
voice
.
``
Are
you
asleep
,
that
you
do
n't
*NL*
answer
when
I
ring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
heard
the
door
of
communication
opened
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
am
I
,
Milady
,
here
am
I
!
''
cried
Kitty
,
springing
forward
to
meet
*NL*
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
went
into
the
bedroom
,
and
as
the
door
of
communication
remained
*NL*
open
,
d'Artagnan
could
hear
Milady
for
some
time
scolding
her
maid
.
She
*NL*
was
at
length
appeased
,
and
the
conversation
turned
upon
him
while
Kitty
*NL*
was
assisting
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
I
have
not
seen
our
Gascon
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Milady
!
has
he
not
come
?
''
said
Kitty
.
``
Can
he
be
inconstant
*NL*
before
being
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
he
must
have
been
prevented
by
Monsieur
de
Treville
or
Monsieur
*NL*
Dessessart
.
I
understand
my
game
,
Kitty
;
I
have
this
one
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
do
with
him
,
madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
I
do
with
him
?
Be
easy
,
Kitty
,
there
is
something
between
*NL*
that
man
and
me
that
he
is
quite
ignorant
of
:
he
nearly
made
me
lose
my
*NL*
credit
with
his
Eminence
.
Oh
,
I
will
be
revenged
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believed
that
Madame
loved
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
him
?
I
detest
him
!
An
idiot
,
who
held
the
life
of
Lord
de
Winter
*NL*
in
his
hands
and
did
not
kill
him
,
by
which
I
missed
three
hundred
*NL*
thousand
livres
'
income
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Kitty
;
``
your
son
was
the
only
heir
of
his
uncle
,
and
*NL*
until
his
majority
you
would
have
had
the
enjoyment
of
his
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
shuddered
to
the
marrow
at
hearing
this
suave
creature
*NL*
reproach
him
,
with
that
sharp
voice
which
she
took
such
pains
to
conceal
*NL*
in
conversation
,
for
not
having
killed
a
man
whom
he
had
seen
load
her
*NL*
with
kindnesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
this
,
''
continued
Milady
,
``
I
should
long
ago
have
revenged
*NL*
myself
on
him
if
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
,
the
cardinal
had
not
requested
*NL*
me
to
conciliate
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
but
Madame
has
not
conciliated
that
little
woman
he
was
so
*NL*
fond
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
the
mercer
's
wife
of
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
?
Has
he
not
already
*NL*
forgotten
she
ever
existed
?
Fine
vengeance
that
,
on
my
faith
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
sweat
broke
from
d'Artagnan
's
brow
.
Why
,
this
woman
was
a
*NL*
monster
!
He
resumed
his
listening
,
but
unfortunately
the
toilet
was
*NL*
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
said
Milady
;
``
go
into
your
own
room
,
and
tomorrow
*NL*
endeavor
again
to
get
me
an
answer
to
the
letter
I
gave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Monsieur
de
Wardes
?
''
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
;
for
Monsieur
de
Wardes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
there
is
one
,
''
said
Kitty
,
``
who
appears
to
me
quite
a
different
*NL*
sort
of
a
man
from
that
poor
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
bed
,
mademoiselle
,
''
said
Milady
;
``
I
do
n't
like
comments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
heard
the
door
close
;
then
the
noise
of
two
bolts
by
which
*NL*
Milady
fastened
herself
in
.
On
her
side
,
but
as
softly
as
possible
,
*NL*
Kitty
turned
the
key
of
the
lock
,
and
then
d'Artagnan
opened
the
closet
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
Lord
!
''
said
Kitty
,
in
a
low
voice
,
``
what
is
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
?
How
pale
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
abominable
creature
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
silence
,
begone
!
''
said
Kitty
.
``
There
is
nothing
but
a
wainscot
*NL*
between
my
chamber
and
Milady
's
;
every
word
that
is
uttered
in
one
can
*NL*
be
heard
in
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
the
reason
I
wo
n't
go
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Kitty
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
,
at
least
,
I
will
go
--
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
Kitty
to
him
.
She
had
the
less
motive
to
resist
,
resistance
*NL*
would
make
so
much
noise
.
Therefore
Kitty
surrendered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
movement
of
vengeance
upon
Milady
.
D'Artagnan
believed
it
right
*NL*
to
say
that
vengeance
is
the
pleasure
of
the
gods
.
With
a
little
more
*NL*
heart
,
he
might
have
been
contented
with
this
new
conquest
;
but
the
*NL*
principal
features
of
his
character
were
ambition
and
pride
.
It
must
,
*NL*
however
,
be
confessed
in
his
justification
that
the
first
use
he
made
of
*NL*
his
influence
over
Kitty
was
to
try
and
find
out
what
had
become
of
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
;
but
the
poor
girl
swore
upon
the
crucifix
to
d'Artagnan
that
*NL*
she
was
entirely
ignorant
on
that
head
,
her
mistress
never
admitting
her
*NL*
into
half
her
secrets
--
only
she
believed
she
could
say
she
was
not
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
cause
which
was
near
making
Milady
lose
her
credit
with
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
Kitty
knew
nothing
about
it
;
but
this
time
d'Artagnan
was
*NL*
better
informed
than
she
was
.
As
he
had
seen
Milady
on
board
a
vessel
at
*NL*
the
moment
he
was
leaving
England
,
he
suspected
that
it
was
,
almost
*NL*
without
a
doubt
,
on
account
of
the
diamond
studs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
was
clearest
in
all
this
was
that
the
true
hatred
,
the
profound
*NL*
hatred
,
the
inveterate
hatred
of
Milady
,
was
increased
by
his
not
having
*NL*
killed
her
brother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
came
the
next
day
to
Milady
's
,
and
finding
her
in
a
very
*NL*
ill-humor
,
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
lack
of
an
answer
from
M.
de
Wardes
*NL*
that
provoked
her
thus
.
Kitty
came
in
,
but
Milady
was
very
cross
with
*NL*
her
.
The
poor
girl
ventured
a
glance
at
d'Artagnan
which
said
,
``
See
how
*NL*
I
suffer
on
your
account
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
the
end
of
the
evening
,
however
,
the
beautiful
lioness
became
*NL*
milder
;
she
smilingly
listened
to
the
soft
speeches
of
d'Artagnan
,
and
*NL*
even
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
departed
,
scarcely
knowing
what
to
think
,
but
as
he
was
a
*NL*
youth
who
did
not
easily
lose
his
head
,
while
continuing
to
pay
his
*NL*
court
to
Milady
,
he
had
framed
a
little
plan
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Kitty
at
the
gate
,
and
,
as
on
the
preceding
evening
,
went
up
to
*NL*
her
chamber
.
Kitty
had
been
accused
of
negligence
and
severely
scolded
.
*NL*
Milady
could
not
at
all
comprehend
the
silence
of
the
Comte
de
Wardes
,
*NL*
and
she
ordered
Kitty
to
come
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
take
a
*NL*
third
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
made
Kitty
promise
to
bring
him
that
letter
on
the
following
*NL*
morning
.
The
poor
girl
promised
all
her
lover
desired
;
she
was
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
passed
as
on
the
night
before
.
D'Artagnan
concealed
himself
in
*NL*
his
closet
;
Milady
called
,
undressed
,
sent
away
Kitty
,
and
shut
the
*NL*
door
.
As
the
night
before
,
d'Artagnan
did
not
return
home
till
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
Kitty
came
to
him
.
She
held
in
her
hand
a
fresh
billet
*NL*
from
Milady
.
This
time
the
poor
girl
did
not
even
argue
with
d'Artagnan
;
*NL*
she
gave
it
to
him
at
once
.
She
belonged
body
and
soul
to
her
handsome
*NL*
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
third
time
I
have
written
to
you
to
tell
you
that
I
love
*NL*
you
.
Beware
that
I
do
not
write
to
you
a
fourth
time
to
tell
you
that
I
*NL*
detest
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
repent
of
the
manner
in
which
you
have
acted
toward
me
,
the
young
*NL*
girl
who
brings
you
this
will
tell
you
how
a
man
of
spirit
may
obtain
*NL*
his
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
colored
and
grew
pale
several
times
in
reading
this
billet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
love
her
still
,
''
said
Kitty
,
who
had
not
taken
her
eyes
off
the
*NL*
young
man
's
countenance
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Kitty
,
you
are
mistaken
.
I
do
not
love
her
,
but
I
will
avenge
*NL*
myself
for
her
contempt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
know
what
sort
of
vengeance
!
You
told
me
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
matters
it
to
you
,
Kitty
?
You
know
it
is
you
alone
whom
I
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
scorn
I
will
throw
upon
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
a
pen
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
,
Until
the
present
moment
I
could
not
believe
that
it
was
to
me
*NL*
your
first
two
letters
were
addressed
,
so
unworthy
did
I
feel
myself
of
*NL*
such
an
honor
;
besides
,
I
was
so
seriously
indisposed
that
I
could
not
*NL*
in
any
case
have
replied
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
I
am
forced
to
believe
in
the
excess
of
your
kindness
,
since
not
*NL*
only
your
letter
but
your
servant
assures
me
that
I
have
the
good
*NL*
fortune
to
be
beloved
by
you

*NL*
*NL*
She
has
no
occasion
to
teach
me
the
way
in
which
a
man
of
spirit
may
*NL*
obtain
his
pardon
.
I
will
come
and
ask
mine
at
eleven
o'clock
this
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
delay
it
a
single
day
would
be
in
my
eyes
now
to
commit
a
fresh
*NL*
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
him
whom
you
have
rendered
the
happiest
of
men
,
Comte
de
Wardes
*NL*
*NL*
This
note
was
in
the
first
place
a
forgery
;
it
was
likewise
an
*NL*
indelicacy
.
It
was
even
,
according
to
our
present
manners
,
something
*NL*
like
an
infamous
action
;
but
at
that
period
people
did
not
manage
*NL*
affairs
as
they
do
today
.
Besides
,
d'Artagnan
from
her
own
admission
*NL*
knew
Milady
culpable
of
treachery
in
matters
more
important
,
and
could
*NL*
entertain
no
respect
for
her
.
And
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
want
of
*NL*
respect
,
he
felt
an
uncontrollable
passion
for
this
woman
boiling
in
his
*NL*
veins
--
passion
drunk
with
contempt
;
but
passion
or
thirst
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
pleases
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
's
plan
was
very
simple
.
By
Kitty
's
chamber
he
could
gain
that
*NL*
of
her
mistress
.
He
would
take
advantage
of
the
first
moment
of
*NL*
surprise
,
shame
,
and
terror
,
to
triumph
over
her
.
He
might
fail
,
but
*NL*
something
must
be
left
to
chance
.
In
eight
days
the
campaign
would
open
,
*NL*
and
he
would
be
compelled
to
leave
Paris
;
d'Artagnan
had
no
time
for
a
*NL*
prolonged
love
siege
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
handing
Kitty
the
letter
sealed
;
``
give
that
*NL*
to
Milady
.
It
is
the
count
's
reply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Kitty
became
as
pale
as
death
;
she
suspected
what
the
letter
*NL*
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
my
dear
girl
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
you
can
not
but
perceive
that
*NL*
all
this
must
end
,
some
way
or
other
.
Milady
may
discover
that
you
gave
*NL*
the
first
billet
to
my
lackey
instead
of
to
the
count
's
;
that
it
is
I
*NL*
who
have
opened
the
others
which
ought
to
have
been
opened
by
de
Wardes
.
*NL*
Milady
will
then
turn
you
out
of
doors
,
and
you
know
she
is
not
the
*NL*
woman
to
limit
her
vengeance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Kitty
,
``
for
whom
have
I
exposed
myself
to
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
,
I
well
know
,
my
sweet
girl
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
But
I
am
*NL*
grateful
,
I
swear
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
does
this
note
contain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Milady
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
not
love
me
!
''
cried
Kitty
,
``
and
I
am
very
wretched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
reproach
there
is
always
one
response
which
deludes
women
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
replied
in
such
a
manner
that
Kitty
remained
in
her
great
*NL*
delusion
.
Although
she
cried
freely
before
deciding
to
transmit
the
*NL*
letter
to
her
mistress
,
she
did
at
last
so
decide
,
which
was
all
*NL*
d'Artagnan
wished
.
Finally
he
promised
that
he
would
leave
her
*NL*
mistress
's
presence
at
an
early
hour
that
evening
,
and
that
when
he
left
*NL*
the
mistress
he
would
ascend
with
the
maid
.
This
promise
completed
poor
*NL*
Kitty
's
consolation
.

34
IN
WHICH
THE
EQUIPMENT
OF
ARAMIS
AND
PORTHOS
IS
TREATED
OF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
four
friends
had
been
each
in
search
of
his
equipments
,
there
*NL*
had
been
no
fixed
meeting
between
them
.
They
dined
apart
from
one
*NL*
another
,
wherever
they
might
happen
to
be
,
or
rather
where
they
could
.
*NL*
Duty
likewise
on
its
part
took
a
portion
of
that
precious
time
which
was
*NL*
gliding
away
so
rapidly
--
only
they
had
agreed
to
meet
once
a
week
,
about
*NL*
one
o'clock
,
at
the
residence
of
Athos
,
seeing
that
he
,
in
agreement
*NL*
with
the
vow
he
had
formed
,
did
not
pass
over
the
threshold
of
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
day
of
reunion
was
the
same
day
as
that
on
which
Kitty
came
to
find
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
Soon
as
Kitty
left
him
,
d'Artagnan
directed
his
steps
toward
*NL*
the
Rue
Ferou
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
Athos
and
Aramis
philosophizing
.
Aramis
had
some
slight
*NL*
inclination
to
resume
the
cassock
.
Athos
,
according
to
his
system
,
*NL*
neither
encouraged
nor
dissuaded
him
.
Athos
believed
that
everyone
*NL*
should
be
left
to
his
own
free
will
.
He
never
gave
advice
but
when
it
*NL*
was
asked
,
and
even
then
he
required
to
be
asked
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
,
in
general
,
''
he
said
,
``
only
ask
advice
not
to
follow
it
;
or
if
*NL*
they
do
follow
it
,
it
is
for
the
sake
of
having
someone
to
blame
for
*NL*
having
given
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
arrived
a
minute
after
d'Artagnan
.
The
four
friends
were
*NL*
reunited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
countenances
expressed
four
different
feelings
:
that
of
*NL*
Porthos
,
tranquillity
;
that
of
d'Artagnan
,
hope
;
that
of
Aramis
,
*NL*
uneasiness
;
that
of
Athos
,
carelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
moment
's
conversation
,
in
which
Porthos
hinted
that
a
*NL*
lady
of
elevated
rank
had
condescended
to
relieve
him
from
his
*NL*
embarrassment
,
Mousqueton
entered
.
He
came
to
request
his
master
to
*NL*
return
to
his
lodgings
,
where
his
presence
was
urgent
,
as
he
piteously
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
my
equipment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
and
no
,
''
replied
Mousqueton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
ca
n't
you
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
rose
,
saluted
his
friends
,
and
followed
Mousqueton
.
An
instant
*NL*
after
,
Bazin
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
with
me
,
my
friend
?
''
said
Aramis
,
with
that
mildness
*NL*
of
language
which
was
observable
in
him
every
time
that
his
ideas
were
*NL*
directed
toward
the
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
wishes
to
see
Monsieur
at
home
,
''
replied
Bazin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
!
What
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mendicant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
alms
,
Bazin
,
and
bid
him
pray
for
a
poor
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
mendicant
insists
upon
speaking
to
you
,
and
pretends
that
you
will
*NL*
be
very
glad
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
sent
no
particular
message
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
If
Monsieur
Aramis
hesitates
to
come
,
''
he
said
,
``
tell
him
I
am
*NL*
from
Tours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Tours
!
''
cried
Aramis
.
``
A
thousand
pardons
,
gentlemen
;
but
no
doubt
*NL*
this
man
brings
me
the
news
I
expected
.
''
And
rising
also
,
he
went
off
at
*NL*
a
quick
pace
.
There
remained
Athos
and
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
these
fellows
have
managed
their
business
.
What
do
you
think
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
Porthos
was
in
a
fair
way
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
as
to
*NL*
Aramis
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
have
never
been
seriously
uneasy
on
his
*NL*
account
.
But
you
,
my
dear
Athos
--
you
,
who
so
generously
distributed
the
*NL*
Englishman
's
pistoles
,
which
were
our
legitimate
property
--
what
do
you
*NL*
mean
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
satisfied
with
having
killed
that
fellow
,
my
boy
,
seeing
that
it
*NL*
is
blessed
bread
to
kill
an
Englishman
;
but
if
I
had
pocketed
his
*NL*
pistoles
,
they
would
have
weighed
me
down
like
a
remorse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
,
my
dear
Athos
;
you
have
truly
inconceivable
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
pass
.
What
do
you
think
of
Monsieur
de
Treville
telling
me
,
when
*NL*
he
did
me
the
honor
to
call
upon
me
yesterday
,
that
you
associated
with
*NL*
the
suspected
English
,
whom
the
cardinal
protects
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
I
visit
an
Englishwoman
--
the
one
I
named
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ay
!
the
fair
woman
on
whose
account
I
gave
you
advice
,
which
*NL*
naturally
you
took
care
not
to
adopt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
you
my
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
look
there
for
your
outfit
,
I
think
you
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
have
acquired
certain
knowledge
that
that
woman
was
*NL*
concerned
in
the
abduction
of
Madame
Bonacieux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
understand
now
:
to
find
one
woman
,
you
court
another
.
It
is
the
*NL*
longest
road
,
but
certainly
the
most
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
on
the
point
of
telling
Athos
all
;
but
one
consideration
*NL*
restrained
him
.
Athos
was
a
gentleman
,
punctilious
in
points
of
honor
;
*NL*
and
there
were
in
the
plan
which
our
lover
had
devised
for
Milady
,
he
*NL*
was
sure
,
certain
things
that
would
not
obtain
the
assent
of
this
*NL*
Puritan
.
He
was
therefore
silent
;
and
as
Athos
was
the
least
inquisitive
*NL*
of
any
man
on
earth
,
d'Artagnan
's
confidence
stopped
there
.
We
will
*NL*
therefore
leave
the
two
friends
,
who
had
nothing
important
to
say
to
*NL*
each
other
,
and
follow
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
being
informed
that
the
person
who
wanted
to
speak
to
him
came
from
*NL*
Tours
,
we
have
seen
with
what
rapidity
the
young
man
followed
,
or
rather
*NL*
went
before
,
Bazin
;
he
ran
without
stopping
from
the
Rue
Ferou
to
the
*NL*
Rue
de
Vaugirard
.
On
entering
he
found
a
man
of
short
stature
and
*NL*
intelligent
eyes
,
but
covered
with
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
asked
for
me
?
''
said
the
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
speak
with
Monsieur
Aramis
.
Is
that
your
name
,
monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
very
own
.
You
have
brought
me
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
show
me
a
certain
embroidered
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
said
Aramis
,
taking
a
small
key
from
his
breast
and
*NL*
opening
a
little
ebony
box
inlaid
with
mother
of
pearl
,
``
here
it
is
.
*NL*
Look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
right
,
''
replied
the
mendicant
;
``
dismiss
your
lackey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Bazin
,
curious
to
know
what
the
mendicant
could
want
with
his
*NL*
master
,
kept
pace
with
him
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
arrived
almost
at
*NL*
the
same
time
he
did
;
but
his
quickness
was
not
of
much
use
to
him
.
At
*NL*
the
hint
from
the
mendicant
his
master
made
him
a
sign
to
retire
,
and
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
obey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
gone
,
the
mendicant
cast
a
rapid
glance
around
him
in
order
to
be
*NL*
sure
that
nobody
could
either
see
or
hear
him
,
and
opening
his
ragged
*NL*
vest
,
badly
held
together
by
a
leather
strap
,
he
began
to
rip
the
upper
*NL*
part
of
his
doublet
,
from
which
he
drew
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
at
the
sight
of
the
seal
,
kissed
the
*NL*
superscription
with
an
almost
religious
respect
,
and
opened
the
epistle
,
*NL*
which
contained
what
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Friend
,
it
is
the
will
of
fate
that
we
should
be
still
for
some
time
*NL*
separated
;
but
the
delightful
days
of
youth
are
not
lost
beyond
return
.
*NL*
Perform
your
duty
in
camp
;
I
will
do
mine
elsewhere
.
Accept
that
which
*NL*
the
bearer
brings
you
;
make
the
campaign
like
a
handsome
true
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
think
of
me
,
who
kisses
tenderly
your
black
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
;
or
rather
,
AU
REVOIR
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mendicant
continued
to
rip
his
garments
;
and
drew
from
amid
his
rags
*NL*
a
hundred
and
fifty
Spanish
double
pistoles
,
which
he
laid
down
on
the
*NL*
table
;
then
he
opened
the
door
,
bowed
,
and
went
out
before
the
young
*NL*
man
,
stupefied
by
his
letter
,
had
ventured
to
address
a
word
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
then
reperused
the
letter
,
and
perceived
a
postscript
:
*NL*
*NL*
PS
.
You
may
behave
politely
to
the
bearer
,
who
is
a
count
and
a
grandee
*NL*
of
Spain
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Golden
dreams
!
''
cried
Aramis
.
``
Oh
,
beautiful
life
!
Yes
,
we
are
young
;
*NL*
yes
,
we
shall
yet
have
happy
days
!
My
love
,
my
blood
,
my
life
!
all
,
all
,
*NL*
all
,
are
thine
,
my
adored
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
kissed
the
letter
with
passion
,
without
even
vouchsafing
a
look
*NL*
at
the
gold
which
sparkled
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
scratched
at
the
door
,
and
as
Aramis
had
no
longer
any
reason
to
*NL*
exclude
him
,
he
bade
him
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
was
stupefied
at
the
sight
of
the
gold
,
and
forgot
that
he
came
to
*NL*
announce
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
curious
to
know
who
the
mendicant
could
be
,
*NL*
came
to
Aramis
on
leaving
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
d'Artagnan
used
no
ceremony
with
Aramis
,
seeing
that
Bazin
*NL*
forgot
to
announce
him
,
he
announced
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
my
dear
Aramis
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
if
these
are
the
prunes

I
beg
you
will
make
my

the

them

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken

friend
d'Artagnan

said
Aramis
,
always
on
his
guard
;
*NL*
``
this
is
from
my
publisher

who
has
just
sent
me
the
price
of
that

which
I
began
yonder
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

indeed

said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Well
,
your
publisher
is
very
generous

*NL*
my
dear
Aramis

that
's
all
I
can
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
monsieur
?
''
cried
Bazin
,
``
a
poem
sell
so
dear
as
that

It
is
*NL*
incredible
!
Oh
,
monsieur
,
you
can
write
as
much
as
you
like
;
you
may
*NL*
become
equal
to
Monsieur
de
Voiture
and
Monsieur
de
Benserade
.
I
like
*NL*
that
.
A
poet
is
as
good
as
an
abbe

Ah
!
Monsieur
Aramis

become
a
poet

*NL*
I
beg
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bazin
,
my
friend

said
Aramis
,
``
I
believe
you
meddle
with
my
*NL*
conversation

*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
perceived
he
was
wrong
;
he
bowed
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
with
a
smile
,
``
you
sell
your
productions
at
their
*NL*
weight
in
gold

You
are
very
fortunate

my
friend

take
care
or
you
*NL*
will
lose
that
letter
which
is
peeping
from
your
doublet

and
which
also
*NL*
comes
,
no
doubt
,
from
your
publisher

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
blushed
to
the
eyes
,
crammed
in
the
letter
,
and
re-buttoned
his
*NL*
doublet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

he
,
``

we

will
be
rich

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
d'Artagnan
,
with
great
pleasure
.
``
It
is
long
since
we
*NL*
have
had
a
good
dinner
;

I
,
for
my
part
,
have
a
somewhat
hazardous
*NL*
expedition
for
this
evening
,
and
shall
not
be
sorry
,
I
confess
,
to
*NL*
fortify
myself
with
a
few
glasses
of
good
old
Burgundy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
,
as
to
the
old
Burgundy
;
I
have
no
objection
to
that

''
said
*NL*
Aramis
,
from
whom
the
letter
and
the
gold
had
removed
,
as
by
magic
,
his
*NL*
ideas
of
conversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
put
three
or
four
double
pistoles
into
his
pocket
to
answer
*NL*
the
needs
of
the
moment
,
he
placed
the
others
in
the
ebony
box
,
inlaid
*NL*
with
mother
of
pearl
,
in
which
was
the
famous
handkerchief
which
served
*NL*
him
as
a
talisman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
repaired
to
Athos
's
,
and
he
,
faithful
to
his
vow
of
not
*NL*
going
out
,
took
upon
him
to
order
dinner
to
be
brought
to
them
.
As
he
*NL*
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
details
of
gastronomy
,
d'Artagnan
and
*NL*
Aramis
made
no
objection
to
abandoning
this
important
care
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
find
Porthos
,
and
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Bac
met
*NL*
Mousqueton
,
who
,
with
a
most
pitiable
air
,
was
driving
before
him
a
mule
*NL*
and
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
,
which
was
not
quite
free
from
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
yellow
horse
,
''
cried
he
.
``
Aramis
,
look
at
that
horse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
frightful
brute
!
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
upon
that
very
horse
I
came
to
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
does
Monsieur
know
this
horse
?
''
said
Mousqueton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
an
original
color

said
Aramis
;
``
I
never
saw
one

such
a
*NL*
hide

my
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
believe
it

replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
that
was
why
I
got
*NL*
three
crowns
for
him

It
must
have
been
for
his
hide

for
,
CERTES
,
the
*NL*
carcass
is
not
worth
eighteen
livres
.
But
how
did
this
horse
come
into
*NL*
your
hands
,
Mousqueton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
''
said
the
lackey
,
``
say
nothing
about
it
,
monsieur
;
it
is
a
*NL*
frightful
trick
of
the
husband
of
our
duchess

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
,
Mousqueton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
we
are
looked
upon
with
a
rather
favorable
eye
by
a
lady
of
*NL*
quality
,
the
Duchesse
de
--
but
,
your
pardon
;
my
master
has
commanded
me
*NL*
to
be
discreet
.
She
had
forced
us
to
accept
a
little
souvenir
,
a
*NL*
magnificent
Spanish
GENET
and
an
Andalusian
mule
,
which
were
beautiful
*NL*
to
look
upon
.
The
husband
heard
of
the
affair
;
on
their
way
he
*NL*
confiscated
the
two
magnificent
beasts
which
were
being
sent
to
us
,

*NL*
substituted
these
horrible
animals
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
you
are
taking
back
to
him

''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
!

replied
Mousqueton
.
``
You
may
well
believe
that
we
will
not

such
steeds

*NL*
promised
to
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

PARDIEU

though
I
should
like
to
have
seen
Porthos
on
my
yellow
*NL*
horse

That
would
give
me
an
idea
of
how
I
looked
when
I
arrived
in
*NL*
Paris
.
But
do
n't
let
us
hinder
you
,
Mousqueton
;
go
and
perform
your
*NL*
master
's
orders
.
Is
he
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

monsieur

said
Mousqueton
,
``
but
in
a
very
ill
humor

Get
up

*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
his
way
toward
the
Quai
des
Grands
Augustins
,
while
the
two
*NL*
friends
went
to
ring
at
the
bell
of
the
unfortunate
Porthos
.
He
,
having
*NL*
seen
them
crossing
the
yard
,
took
care
not
to
answer
,
and
they
rang
in
*NL*
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Mousqueton
continued
on
his
way
,
and
crossing
the
Pont
Neuf
,
*NL*
still
driving
the
two
sorry
animals
before
him
,
he
reached
the
Rue
aux
*NL*
Ours
.
Arrived
there
,
he
fastened
,
according
to
the
orders
of
his
master
,
*NL*
both
horse
and
mule
to
the
knocker
of
the
procurator
's
door
;
then
,
*NL*
without
taking
any
thought
for
their
future
,
he
returned
to
Porthos
,
and
*NL*
told
him
that
his
commission
was
completed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
short
time
the
two
unfortunate
beasts
,
who
had
not
eaten
anything
*NL*
since
the
morning
,
made
such
a
noise
in
raising
and
letting
fall
the
*NL*
knocker
that
the
procurator
ordered
his
errand
boy
to
go
and
inquire
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
to
whom
this
horse
and
mule
belonged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
recognized
her
present
,
and
could
not
at
first
comprehend
*NL*
this
restitution
;
but
the
visit
of
Porthos
soon
enlightened
her
.
The
*NL*
anger
which
fired
the
eyes
of
the
Musketeer
,
in
spite
of
his
efforts
to
*NL*
suppress
it
,
terrified
his
sensitive
inamorata
.
In
fact
,
Mousqueton
had
*NL*
not
concealed
from
his
master
that
he
had
met
d'Artagnan
and
Aramis
,
and
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
in
the
yellow
horse
had
recognized
the
Bearnese
pony
*NL*
upon
which
he
had
come
to
Paris
,
and
which
he
had
sold
for
three
crowns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
went
away
after
having
appointed
a
meeting
with
the
procurator
's
*NL*
wife
in
the
cloister
of
St.
Magloire
.
The
procurator
,
seeing
he
was
*NL*
going
,
invited
him
to
dinner
--
an
invitation
which
the
Musketeer
refused
*NL*
with
a
majestic
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
repaired
trembling
to
the
cloister
of
St.
Magloire
,
for
*NL*
she
guessed
the
reproaches
that
awaited
her
there
;
but
she
was
*NL*
fascinated
by
the
lofty
airs
of
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
which
a
man
wounded
in
his
self-love
could
let
fall
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
imprecations
and
reproaches
upon
the
head
of
a
woman
Porthos
*NL*
let
fall
upon
the
bowed
head
of
the
procurator
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
did
all
for
the
best
!
One
of
our
clients
is
a
*NL*
horsedealer
;
he
owes
money
to
the
office
,
and
is
backward
in
his
pay
.
I
*NL*
took
the
mule
and
the
horse
for
what
he
owed
us
;
he
assured
me
that
they
*NL*
were
two
noble
steeds
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

madame

said
Porthos
,
``
if
he
owed
you
more
than
five
crowns

your
horsedealer
is
a
thief

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
harm
in
trying
to
buy
things
cheap

Monsieur
Porthos

said
*NL*
the
procurator
's
wife
,
seeking
to
excuse
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
madame
;
but
they
who
so
assiduously
try

buy

cheap

permit

seek
more
generous
friends

And
Porthos
,
turning
on
*NL*
his
heel
,
made
a
step
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Porthos

Monsieur
Porthos

cried
the
procurator
's
wife
.
``
I
*NL*
have
been
wrong
;
I
see
it

I
ought
not
to
have
driven
a
bargain
when
it
*NL*
was
to
equip
a
cavalier
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
,
without
reply
,
retreated
a
second
step
.
The
procurator
's
wife
*NL*
fancied
she
saw
him
in
a
brilliant
cloud
,
all
surrounded
by
duchesses
*NL*
and
marchionesses
,
who
cast
bags
of
money
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
in
the
name
of
heaven

Monsieur
Porthos

cried
she
.
``
Stop

*NL*
let
us
talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Talking
with
you
brings
me
misfortune

said
Porthos

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

tell
me
,
what
do
you
ask

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

for
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
as
if
I
asked
you
for
*NL*
something

*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
's
wife
hung
upon
the
arm
of
Porthos
,
and
in
the
violence
*NL*
of
her
grief
she
cried
out
,
``
Monsieur
Porthos
,
I
am
ignorant
of
all
such
*NL*
matters

How

I
know

How

``
You

wished

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

A
GASCON
A
MATCH
FOR
CUPID
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
so
impatiently
waited
for
by
Porthos
and
by
d'Artagnan
at
*NL*
last
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
was
his
custom
,
d'Artagnan
presented
himself
at
Milady
's
at
about
*NL*
nine
o'clock
.
He
found
her
in
a
charming
humor
.
Never
had
he
been
so
*NL*
well
received
.
Our
Gascon
knew
,
by
the
first
glance
of
his
eye
,
that
his
*NL*
billet
had
been
delivered
,
and
that
this
billet
had
had
its
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
entered
to
bring
some
sherbet
.
Her
mistress
put
on
a
charming
*NL*
face
,
and
smiled
on
her
graciously
;
but
alas
!
the
poor
girl
was
so
sad
*NL*
that
she
did
not
even
notice
Milady
's
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
looked
at
the
two
women
,
one
after
the
other
,
and
was
forced
*NL*
to
acknowledge
that
in
his
opinion
Dame
Nature
had
made
a
mistake
in
*NL*
their
formation
.
To
the
great
lady
she
had
given
a
heart
vile
and
venal
;
*NL*
to
the
SOUBRETTE
she
had
given
the
heart
of
a
duchess
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Milady
began
to
appear
restless
.
D'Artagnan
knew
what
she
*NL*
wanted
.
She
looked
at
the
clock
,
rose
,
reseated
herself
,
smiled
at
*NL*
d'Artagnan
with
an
air
which
said
,
``
You
are
very
amiable
,
no
doubt
,
but
*NL*
you
would
be
charming
if
you
would
only
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
rose
and
took
his
hat
;
Milady
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
.
The
*NL*
young
man
felt
her
press
his
hand
,
and
comprehended
that
this
was
a
*NL*
sentiment
,
not
of
coquetry
,
but
of
gratitude
because
of
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
loves
him
devilishly
,
''
he
murmured
.
Then
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Kitty
was
nowhere
waiting
for
him
;
neither
in
the
antechamber
,
*NL*
nor
in
the
corridor
,
nor
beneath
the
great
door
.
It
was
necessary
that
*NL*
d'Artagnan
should
find
alone
the
staircase
and
the
little
chamber
.
She
*NL*
heard
him
enter
,
but
she
did
not
raise
her
head
.
The
young
man
went
to
*NL*
her
and
took
her
hands
;
then
she
sobbed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
d'Artagnan
had
presumed
,
on
receiving
his
letter
,
Milady
in
a
*NL*
delirium
of
joy
had
told
her
servant
everything
;
and
by
way
of
*NL*
recompense
for
the
manner
in
which
she
had
this
time
executed
the
*NL*
commission
,
she
had
given
Kitty
a
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
to
her
own
room
,
Kitty
had
thrown
the
purse
into
a
corner
,
*NL*
where
it
lay
open
,
disgorging
three
or
four
gold
pieces
on
the
carpet
.
*NL*
The
poor
girl
,
under
the
caresses
of
d'Artagnan
,
lifted
her
head
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
himself
was
frightened
by
the
change
in
her
countenance
.
She
*NL*
joined
her
hands
with
a
suppliant
air
,
but
without
venturing
to
speak
a
*NL*
word
.
As
little
sensitive
as
was
the
heart
of
d'Artagnan
,
he
was
touched
*NL*
by
this
mute
sorrow
;
but
he
held
too
tenaciously
to
his
projects
,
above
*NL*
all
to
this
one
,
to
change
the
program
which
he
had
laid
out
in
advance
.
*NL*
He
did
not
therefore
allow
her
any
hope
that
he
would
flinch
;
only
he
*NL*
represented
his
action
as
one
of
simple
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
rest
this
vengeance
was
very
easy
;
for
Milady
,
doubtless
to
*NL*
conceal
her
blushes
from
her
lover
,
had
ordered
Kitty
to
extinguish
all
*NL*
the
lights
in
the
apartment
,
and
even
in
the
little
chamber
itself
.
*NL*
Before
daybreak
M.
de
Wardes
must
take
his
departure
,
still
in
*NL*
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
they
heard
Milady
retire
to
her
room
.
D'Artagnan
slipped
into
*NL*
the
wardrobe
.
Hardly
was
he
concealed
when
the
little
bell
sounded
.
*NL*
Kitty
went
to
her
mistress
,
and
did
not
leave
the
door
open
;
but
the
*NL*
partition
was
so
thin
that
one
could
hear
nearly
all
that
passed
between
*NL*
the
two
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
seemed
overcome
with
joy
,
and
made
Kitty
repeat
the
smallest
*NL*
details
of
the
pretended
interview
of
the
soubrette
with
de
Wardes
when
*NL*
he
received
the
letter
;
how
he
had
responded
;
what
was
the
expression
of
*NL*
his
face
;
if
he
seemed
very
amorous
.
And
to
all
these
questions
poor
*NL*
Kitty
,
forced
to
put
on
a
pleasant
face
,
responded
in
a
stifled
voice
*NL*
whose
dolorous
accent
her
mistress
did
not
however
remark
,
solely
*NL*
because
happiness
is
egotistical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
as
the
hour
for
her
interview
with
the
count
approached
,
Milady
*NL*
had
everything
about
her
darkened
,
and
ordered
Kitty
to
return
to
her
*NL*
own
chamber
,
and
introduce
de
Wardes
whenever
he
presented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
detention
was
not
long
.
Hardly
had
d'Artagnan
seen
,
through
a
*NL*
crevice
in
his
closet
,
that
the
whole
apartment
was
in
obscurity
,
than
*NL*
he
slipped
out
of
his
concealment
,
at
the
very
moment
when
Kitty
*NL*
reclosed
the
door
of
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
noise
?
''
demanded
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
in
a
subdued
voice
,
``
I
,
the
Comte
de
Wardes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
murmured
Kitty
,
``
he
has
not
even
waited
for
the
*NL*
hour
he
himself
named
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
a
trembling
voice
,
``
why
do
you
not
enter
?
Count
,
*NL*
Count
,
''
added
she
,
``
you
know
that
I
wait
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
appeal
d'Artagnan
drew
Kitty
quietly
away
,
and
slipped
into
the
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
rage
or
sorrow
ever
torture
the
heart
,
it
is
when
a
lover
receives
*NL*
under
a
name
which
is
not
his
own
protestations
of
love
addressed
to
his
*NL*
happy
rival
.
D'Artagnan
was
in
a
dolorous
situation
which
he
had
not
*NL*
foreseen
.
Jealousy
gnawed
his
heart
;
and
he
suffered
almost
as
much
as
*NL*
poor
Kitty
,
who
at
that
very
moment
was
crying
in
the
next
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Count
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
her
softest
voice
,
and
pressing
his
hand
*NL*
in
her
own
,
``
I
am
happy
in
the
love
which
your
looks
and
your
words
have
*NL*
expressed
to
me
every
time
we
have
met
.
I
also
--
I
love
you
.
Oh
,
*NL*
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
,
I
must
have
some
pledge
from
you
which
will
prove
*NL*
that
you
think
of
me
;
and
that
you
may
not
forget
me
,
take
this
!
''
and
*NL*
she
slipped
a
ring
from
her
finger
onto
d'Artagnan
's
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
remembered
having
seen
this
ring
on
the
finger
of
Milady
;
it
was
a
*NL*
magnificent
sapphire
,
encircled
with
brilliants
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
movement
of
d'Artagnan
was
to
return
it
,
but
Milady
added
,
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
Keep
that
ring
for
love
of
me
.
Besides
,
in
accepting
it
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
,
``
you
render
me
a
much
greater
service
*NL*
than
you
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
woman
is
full
of
mysteries
,
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
to
himself
.
At
*NL*
that
instant
he
felt
himself
ready
to
reveal
all
.
He
even
opened
his
*NL*
mouth
to
tell
Milady
who
he
was
,
and
with
what
a
revengeful
purpose
he
*NL*
had
come
;
but
she
added
,
``
Poor
angel
,
whom
that
monster
of
a
Gascon
*NL*
barely
failed
to
kill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
monster
was
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
continued
Milady
,
``
do
your
wounds
still
make
you
suffer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
much
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
did
not
well
know
how
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
tranquil
,
''
murmured
Milady
;
``
I
will
avenge
you
--
and
cruelly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
PESTE
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
,
``
the
moment
for
confidences
has
not
*NL*
yet
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
some
time
for
d'Artagnan
to
resume
this
little
dialogue
;
but
*NL*
then
all
the
ideas
of
vengeance
which
he
had
brought
with
him
had
*NL*
completely
vanished
.
This
woman
exercised
over
him
an
unaccountable
*NL*
power
;
he
hated
and
adored
her
at
the
same
time
.
He
would
not
have
*NL*
believed
that
two
sentiments
so
opposite
could
dwell
in
the
same
heart
,
*NL*
and
by
their
union
constitute
a
passion
so
strange
,
and
as
it
were
,
*NL*
diabolical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
it
sounded
one
o'clock
.
It
was
necessary
to
separate
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
at
the
moment
of
quitting
Milady
felt
only
the
liveliest
*NL*
regret
at
the
parting
;
and
as
they
addressed
each
other
in
a
*NL*
reciprocally
passionate
adieu
,
another
interview
was
arranged
for
the
*NL*
following
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Kitty
hoped
to
speak
a
few
words
to
d'Artagnan
when
he
passed
*NL*
through
her
chamber
;
but
Milady
herself
reconducted
him
through
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
only
quit
him
at
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
d'Artagnan
ran
to
find
Athos
.
He
was
engaged
in
an
*NL*
adventure
so
singular
that
he
wished
for
counsel
.
He
therefore
told
him
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Milady
,
''
said
he
,
``
appears
to
be
an
infamous
creature
,
but
not
the
*NL*
less
you
have
done
wrong
to
deceive
her
.
In
one
fashion
or
another
you
*NL*
have
a
terrible
enemy
on
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
thus
speaking
Athos
regarded
with
attention
the
sapphire
set
with
*NL*
diamonds
which
had
taken
,
on
d'Artagnan
's
finger
,
the
place
of
the
*NL*
queen
's
ring
,
carefully
kept
in
a
casket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
notice
my
ring
?
''
said
the
Gascon
,
proud
to
display
so
rich
a
gift
*NL*
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
it
reminds
me
of
a
family
jewel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
beautiful
,
is
it
not
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
magnificent
.
I
did
not
think
two
sapphires
of
such
a
*NL*
fine
water
existed
.
Have
you
traded
it
for
your
diamond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
is
a
gift
from
my
beautiful
Englishwoman
,
or
rather
*NL*
Frenchwoman
--
for
I
am
convinced
she
was
born
in
France
,
though
I
have
*NL*
not
questioned
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ring
comes
from
Milady
?
''
cried
Athos
,
with
a
voice
in
which
it
was
*NL*
easy
to
detect
strong
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
very
self
;
she
gave
it
me
last
night
.
Here
it
is
,
''
replied
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
taking
it
from
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
examined
it
and
became
very
pale
.
He
tried
it
on
his
left
hand
;
it
*NL*
fit
his
finger
as
if
made
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shade
of
anger
and
vengeance
passed
across
the
usually
calm
brow
of
*NL*
this
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
it
can
be
she
,
''
said
he
.
``
How
could
this
ring
come
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
Milady
Clarik
?
And
yet
it
is
difficult
to
suppose
such
*NL*
a
resemblance
should
exist
between
two
jewels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
this
ring
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
did
,
''
replied
Athos
;
``
but
no
doubt
I
was
mistaken
.
''
And
he
*NL*
returned
d'Artagnan
the
ring
without
,
however
,
ceasing
to
look
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Athos
,
after
a
minute
,
``
either
take
off
that
*NL*
ring
or
turn
the
mounting
inside
;
it
recalls
such
cruel
recollections
*NL*
that
I
shall
have
no
head
to
converse
with
you
.
Do
n't
ask
me
for
*NL*
counsel
;
do
n't
tell
me
you
are
perplexed
what
to
do
.
But
stop
!
let
me
*NL*
look
at
that
sapphire
again
;
the
one
I
mentioned
to
you
had
one
of
its
*NL*
faces
scratched
by
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
off
the
ring
,
giving
it
again
to
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
started
.
``
Look
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
it
not
strange
?
''
and
he
pointed
out
*NL*
to
d'Artagnan
the
scratch
he
had
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
from
whom
did
this
ring
come
to
you
,
Athos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
my
mother
,
who
inherited
it
from
her
mother
.
As
I
told
you
,
it
is
*NL*
an
old
family
jewel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
--
sold
it
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
,
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Athos
,
with
a
singular
smile
.
``
I
gave
it
away
in
a
night
*NL*
of
love
,
as
it
has
been
given
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
became
pensive
in
his
turn
;
it
appeared
as
if
there
were
*NL*
abysses
in
Milady
's
soul
whose
depths
were
dark
and
unknown
.
He
took
*NL*
back
the
ring
,
but
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
not
on
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Athos
,
taking
his
hand
,
``
you
know
I
love
you
;
if
I
*NL*
had
a
son
I
could
not
love
him
better
.
Take
my
advice
,
renounce
this
*NL*
woman
.
I
do
not
know
her
,
but
a
sort
of
intuition
tells
me
she
is
a
lost
*NL*
creature
,
and
that
there
is
something
fatal
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
will
have
done
with
her
.
I
own
that
*NL*
this
woman
terrifies
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
have
the
courage
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
my
young
friend
,
you
will
act
rightly
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
*NL*
pressing
the
Gascon
's
hand
with
an
affection
almost
paternal
;
``
and
God
*NL*
grant
that
this
woman
,
who
has
scarcely
entered
into
your
life
,
may
not
*NL*
leave
a
terrible
trace
in
it
!
''
And
Athos
bowed
to
d'Artagnan
like
a
man
*NL*
who
wishes
it
understood
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
be
left
alone
*NL*
with
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
d'Artagnan
found
Kitty
waiting
for
him
.
A
month
of
*NL*
fever
could
not
have
changed
her
more
than
this
one
night
of
*NL*
sleeplessness
and
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sent
by
her
mistress
to
the
false
de
Wardes
.
Her
mistress
was
*NL*
mad
with
love
,
intoxicated
with
joy
.
She
wished
to
know
when
her
lover
*NL*
would
meet
her
a
second
night
;
and
poor
Kitty
,
pale
and
trembling
,
*NL*
awaited
d'Artagnan
's
reply
.
The
counsels
of
his
friend
,
joined
to
the
*NL*
cries
of
his
own
heart
,
made
him
determine
,
now
his
pride
was
saved
and
*NL*
his
vengeance
satisfied
,
not
to
see
Milady
again
.
As
a
reply
,
he
wrote
*NL*
the
following
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
Do
not
depend
upon
me
,
madame
,
for
the
next
meeting
.
Since
my
*NL*
convalescence
I
have
so
many
affairs
of
this
kind
on
my
hands
that
I
am
*NL*
forced
to
regulate
them
a
little
.
When
your
turn
comes
,
I
shall
have
the
*NL*
honor
to
inform
you
of
it
.
I
kiss
your
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Comte
de
Wardes
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
about
the
sapphire
.
Was
the
Gascon
determined
to
keep
it
as
a
*NL*
weapon
against
Milady
,
or
else
,
let
us
be
frank
,
did
he
not
reserve
the
*NL*
sapphire
as
a
last
resource
for
his
outfit
?
It
would
be
wrong
to
judge
*NL*
the
actions
of
one
period
from
the
point
of
view
of
another
.
That
which
*NL*
would
now
be
considered
as
disgraceful
to
a
gentleman
was
at
that
time
*NL*
quite
a
simple
and
natural
affair
,
and
the
younger
sons
of
the
best
*NL*
families
were
frequently
supported
by
their
mistresses
.
D'Artagnan
gave
*NL*
the
open
letter
to
Kitty
,
who
at
first
was
unable
to
comprehend
it
,
but
*NL*
who
became
almost
wild
with
joy
on
reading
it
a
second
time
.
She
could
*NL*
scarcely
believe
in
her
happiness
;
and
d'Artagnan
was
forced
to
renew
*NL*
with
the
living
voice
the
assurances
which
he
had
written
.
And
whatever
*NL*
might
be
--
considering
the
violent
character
of
Milady
--
the
danger
which
*NL*
the
poor
girl
incurred
in
giving
this
billet
to
her
mistress
,
she
ran
*NL*
back
to
the
Place
Royale
as
fast
as
her
legs
could
carry
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heart
of
the
best
woman
is
pitiless
toward
the
sorrows
of
a
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
opened
the
letter
with
eagerness
equal
to
Kitty
's
in
bringing
it
;
*NL*
but
at
the
first
words
she
read
she
became
livid
.
She
crushed
the
paper
*NL*
in
her
hand
,
and
turning
with
flashing
eyes
upon
Kitty
,
she
cried
,
``
What
*NL*
is
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
answer
to
Madame
's
,
''
replied
Kitty
,
all
in
a
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
Milady
.
``
It
is
impossible
a
gentleman
could
have
*NL*
written
such
a
letter
to
a
woman
.
''
Then
all
at
once
,
starting
,
she
*NL*
cried
,
``
My
God
!
can
he
have
--
''
and
she
stopped
.
She
ground
her
teeth
;
*NL*
she
was
of
the
color
of
ashes
.
She
tried
to
go
toward
the
window
for
*NL*
air
,
but
she
could
only
stretch
forth
her
arms
;
her
legs
failed
her
,
and
*NL*
she
sank
into
an
armchair
.
Kitty
,
fearing
she
was
ill
,
hastened
toward
*NL*
her
and
was
beginning
to
open
her
dress
;
but
Milady
started
up
,
pushing
*NL*
her
away
.
``
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
''
said
she
,
``
and
why
do
you
place
*NL*
your
hand
on
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
Madame
was
ill
,
and
I
wished
to
bring
her
help
,
''
*NL*
responded
the
maid
,
frightened
at
the
terrible
expression
which
had
come
*NL*
over
her
mistress
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
faint
?
I
?
I
?
Do
you
take
me
for
half
a
woman
?
When
I
am
insulted
I
do
*NL*
not
faint
;
I
avenge
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
made
a
sign
for
Kitty
to
leave
the
room
.

DREAM
OF
VENGEANCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Milady
gave
orders
that
when
M.
d'Artagnan
came
as
usual
,
*NL*
he
should
be
immediately
admitted
;
but
he
did
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Kitty
went
to
see
the
young
man
again
,
and
related
to
him
*NL*
all
that
had
passed
on
the
preceding
evening
.
D'Artagnan
smiled
;
this
*NL*
jealous
anger
of
Milady
was
his
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Milady
was
still
more
impatient
than
on
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
.
She
renewed
the
order
relative
to
the
Gascon
;
but
as
before
she
*NL*
expected
him
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
Kitty
presented
herself
at
d'Artagnan
's
,
she
was
*NL*
no
longer
joyous
and
alert
as
on
the
two
preceding
days
;
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
sad
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
asked
the
poor
girl
what
was
the
matter
with
her
;
but
she
,
as
*NL*
her
only
reply
,
drew
a
letter
from
her
pocket
and
gave
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
was
in
Milady
's
handwriting
;
only
this
time
it
was
addressed
*NL*
to
M.
d'Artagnan
,
and
not
to
M.
de
Wardes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
M.
d'Artagnan
,
It
is
wrong
thus
to
neglect
your
friends
,
*NL*
particularly
at
the
moment
you
are
about
to
leave
them
for
so
long
a
*NL*
time
.
My
brother-in-law
and
myself
expected
you
yesterday
and
the
day
*NL*
before
,
but
in
vain
.
Will
it
be
the
same
this
evening
?
*NL*
*NL*
Your
very
grateful
,
Milady
Clarik
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
very
simple
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
I
expected
this
letter
.
My
*NL*
credit
rises
by
the
fall
of
that
of
the
Comte
de
Wardes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
you
go
?
''
asked
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
my
dear
girl
,
''
said
the
Gascon
,
who
sought
for
an
excuse
*NL*
in
his
own
eyes
for
breaking
the
promise
he
had
made
Athos
;
``
you
must
*NL*
understand
it
would
be
impolitic
not
to
accept
such
a
positive
*NL*
invitation
.
Milady
,
not
seeing
me
come
again
,
would
not
be
able
to
*NL*
understand
what
could
cause
the
interruption
of
my
visits
,
and
might
*NL*
suspect
something
;
who
could
say
how
far
the
vengeance
of
such
a
woman
*NL*
would
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
said
Kitty
,
``
you
know
how
to
represent
things
in
such
a
*NL*
way
that
you
are
always
in
the
right
.
You
are
going
now
to
pay
your
*NL*
court
to
her
again
,
and
if
this
time
you
succeed
in
pleasing
her
in
your
*NL*
own
name
and
with
your
own
face
,
it
will
be
much
worse
than
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instinct
made
poor
Kitty
guess
a
part
of
what
was
to
happen
.
D'Artagnan
*NL*
reassured
her
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
promised
to
remain
insensible
to
*NL*
the
seductions
of
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
desired
Kitty
to
tell
her
mistress
that
he
could
not
be
more
grateful
*NL*
for
her
kindnesses
than
he
was
,
and
that
he
would
be
obedient
to
her
*NL*
orders
.
He
did
not
dare
to
write
for
fear
of
not
being
able
--
to
such
*NL*
experienced
eyes
as
those
of
Milady
--
to
disguise
his
writing
*NL*
sufficiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
nine
o'clock
sounded
,
d'Artagnan
was
at
the
Place
Royale
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
servants
who
waited
in
the
antechamber
were
warned
,
for
*NL*
as
soon
as
d'Artagnan
appeared
,
before
even
he
had
asked
if
Milady
were
*NL*
visible
,
one
of
them
ran
to
announce
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
him
in
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
a
quick
tone
,
but
so
piercing
that
*NL*
d'Artagnan
heard
her
in
the
antechamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
home
to
nobody
,
''
said
Milady
;
``
observe
,
to
nobody
.
''
The
servant
*NL*
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
Milady
.
She
was
pale
,
and
looked
*NL*
fatigued
,
either
from
tears
or
want
of
sleep
.
The
number
of
lights
had
*NL*
been
intentionally
diminished
,
but
the
young
woman
could
not
conceal
the
*NL*
traces
of
the
fever
which
had
devoured
her
for
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
approached
her
with
his
usual
gallantry
.
She
then
made
an
*NL*
extraordinary
effort
to
receive
him
,
but
never
did
a
more
distressed
*NL*
countenance
give
the
lie
to
a
more
amiable
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
questions
which
d'Artagnan
put
concerning
her
health
,
she
*NL*
replied
,
``
Bad
,
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
replied
he
,
``
my
visit
is
ill-timed
;
you
,
no
doubt
,
stand
in
need
*NL*
of
repose
,
and
I
will
withdraw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
said
Milady
.
``
On
the
contrary
,
stay
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
;
your
*NL*
agreeable
company
will
divert
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
thought
d'Artagnan
.
``
She
has
never
been
so
kind
before
.
On
*NL*
guard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
assumed
the
most
agreeable
air
possible
,
and
conversed
with
more
*NL*
than
her
usual
brilliancy
.
At
the
same
time
the
fever
,
which
for
an
*NL*
instant
abandoned
her
,
returned
to
give
luster
to
her
eyes
,
color
to
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
vermillion
to
her
lips
.
D'Artagnan
was
again
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
Circe
who
had
before
surrounded
him
with
her
enchantments
.
His
*NL*
love
,
which
he
believed
to
be
extinct
but
which
was
only
asleep
,
awoke
*NL*
again
in
his
heart
.
Milady
smiled
,
and
d'Artagnan
felt
that
he
could
*NL*
damn
himself
for
that
smile
.
There
was
a
moment
at
which
he
felt
*NL*
something
like
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
Milady
became
more
communicative
.
She
asked
d'Artagnan
if
he
*NL*
had
a
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
with
the
most
sentimental
air
he
could
assume
,
*NL*
``
can
you
be
cruel
enough
to
put
such
a
question
to
me
--
to
me
,
who
,
from
*NL*
the
moment
I
saw
you
,
have
only
breathed
and
sighed
through
you
and
for
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
smiled
with
a
strange
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
love
me
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
any
need
to
tell
you
so
?
Have
you
not
perceived
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
;
but
you
know
the
more
hearts
are
worth
the
capture
,
the
more
*NL*
difficult
they
are
to
be
won
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
difficulties
do
not
affright
me
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
shrink
before
*NL*
nothing
but
impossibilities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
impossible
,
''
replied
Milady
,
``
to
true
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
thought
d'Artagnan
.
``
The
note
is
changed
.
Is
she
going
to
*NL*
fall
in
love
with
me
,
by
chance
,
this
fair
inconstant
;
and
will
she
be
*NL*
disposed
to
give
me
myself
another
sapphire
like
that
which
she
gave
me
*NL*
for
de
Wardes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
rapidly
drew
his
seat
nearer
to
Milady
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
''
she
said
,
``
let
us
see
what
you
would
do
to
prove
this
love
*NL*
of
which
you
speak
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
could
be
required
of
me

Order

I
am
ready

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
everything
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
who
knew
beforehand
that
he
had
not
*NL*
much
to
risk
in
engaging
himself
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
let
us
talk
a
little
seriously
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
her
turn
*NL*
drawing
her
armchair
nearer
to
d'Artagnan
's
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
all
attention
,
madame
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
remained
thoughtful
and
undecided
for
a
moment
;
then
,
as
if
*NL*
appearing
to
have
formed
a
resolution
,
she
said
,
``
I
have
an
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
madame
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
affecting
surprise
;
``
is
that
possible
,
*NL*
my
God
?
--
good
and
beautiful
as
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mortal
enemy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
enemy
who
has
insulted
me
so
cruelly
that
between
him
and
me
it
is
*NL*
war
to
the
death
.
May
I
reckon
on
you
as
an
auxiliary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
at
once
perceived
the
ground
which
the
vindictive
creature
*NL*
wished
to
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
,
madame
,
''
said
he
,
with
emphasis
.
``
My
arm
and
my
life
belong
to
*NL*
you
,
like
my
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
since
you
are
as
generous
as
you
are
loving

*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
demanded
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Milady
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
,
``
from
the
present
*NL*
time
,
cease
to
talk
of
impossibilities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
overwhelm
me
with
happiness

cried
d'Artagnan
,
throwing
himself
*NL*
on
his
knees
,
and
covering
with
kisses
the
hands
abandoned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Avenge
me
of
that
infamous
de
Wardes

said
Milady
,
between
her
teeth
,
*NL*
``

I
shall
soon
know
how

get
rid

double

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fall
voluntarily
into
my
arms

hypocritical
and
dangerous

*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
likewise
to
himself
,
``
after
having
abused
me
with
such
*NL*
effrontery

afterward
I
will
laugh
at
you
with
him

wish
me
*NL*
to
kill

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
lifted
up
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
understood
me

Monsieur
d'Artagnan

said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
interpret
one
of
your

*NL*
*NL*

Then
you

already
acquired
so

much
renown

*NL*
*NL*
``
Instantly
!

*NL*
*NL*

But
on

Milady

how

I

d'Artagnan

And
he
drew
nearer
to
her

She
scarcely
resisted

Interested
man
!
''
cried
she
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
really
carried
away
by
the
passion
this
woman
*NL*
had
the
power
to
kindle
in
his
heart
,
``
ah
,
that
is
because
my
happiness
*NL*
appears
so
impossible
to
me
;
and
I
have
such
fear
that
it
should
fly
*NL*
away
from
me
like
a
dream
that
I
pant
to
make
a
reality
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
merit
this
pretended
happiness
,
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
orders
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
certain
?
''
said
Milady
,
with
a
last
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
name
to
me
the
base
man
that
has
brought
tears
into
your
beautiful
*NL*
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
that
I
had
been
weeping
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appeared
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
women
as
I
never
weep
,
''
said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
!
Come
,
tell
me
his
name
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
that
his
name
is
all
my
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
I
must
know
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
must
;
see
what
confidence
I
have
in
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
overwhelm
me
with
joy
.
What
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
surely
not
one
of
my
friends
?
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
affecting
*NL*
hesitation
in
order
to
make
her
believe
him
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
one
of
your
friends
you
would
hesitate
,
then
?
''
cried
Milady
;
*NL*
and
a
threatening
glance
darted
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
it
were
my
own
brother
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
as
if
carried
away
by
*NL*
his
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
Gascon
promised
this
without
risk
,
for
he
knew
all
that
was
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
your
devotedness
,
''
said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
do
you
love
nothing
else
in
me
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
also
,
YOU
!
''
said
she
,
taking
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
warm
pressure
made
d'Artagnan
tremble
,
as
if
by
the
touch
that
fever
*NL*
which
consumed
Milady
attacked
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
me
,
you
!
''
cried
he
.
``
Oh
,
if
that
were
so
,
I
should
lose
my
*NL*
reason
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
.
She
made
no
effort
to
remove
her
lips
*NL*
from
his
kisses
;
only
she
did
not
respond
to
them
.
Her
lips
were
cold
;
*NL*
it
appeared
to
d'Artagnan
that
he
had
embraced
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
the
less
intoxicated
with
joy
,
electrified
by
love
.
He
almost
*NL*
believed
in
the
tenderness
of
Milady
;
he
almost
believed
in
the
crime
of
*NL*
de
Wardes
.
If
de
Wardes
had
at
that
moment
been
under
his
hand
,
he
would
*NL*
have
killed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
seized
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
is
--
''
said
she
,
in
her
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Wardes
;
I
know
it
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
it
?
''
asked
Milady
,
seizing
both
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
endeavoring
to
read
with
her
eyes
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
felt
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
,
and
that
he
*NL*
had
committed
an
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
tell
me
,
tell
me
,
I
say
,
''
repeated
Milady
,
``
how
do
you
know
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
know
it
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
because
yesterday
Monsieur
de
Wardes
,
in
a
saloon
where
I
*NL*
was
,
showed
a
ring
which
he
said
he
had
received
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretch
!
''
cried
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
epithet
,
as
may
be
easily
understood
,
resounded
to
the
very
bottom
*NL*
of
d'Artagnan
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
continued
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
avenge
you
of
this
wretch
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
giving
*NL*
himself
the
airs
of
Don
Japhet
of
Armenia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
my
brave
friend
!
''
cried
Milady
;
``
and
when
shall
I
be
avenged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
--
immediately
--
when
you
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
about
to
cry
out
,
``
Immediately
,
''
but
she
reflected
that
such
*NL*
precipitation
would
not
be
very
gracious
toward
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
she
had
a
thousand
precautions
to
take
,
a
thousand
counsels
to
*NL*
give
to
her
defender
,
in
order
that
he
might
avoid
explanations
with
the
*NL*
count
before
witnesses
.
All
this
was
answered
by
an
expression
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
.
``
Tomorrow
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
will
be
avenged
,
or
I
shall
be
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
will
avenge
me
;
but
you
will
not
be
dead
.
He
is
a
*NL*
coward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
women
,
perhaps
;
but
not
with
men
.
I
know
something
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
seems
you
had
not
much
reason
to
complain
of
your
fortune
in
*NL*
your
contest
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortune
is
a
courtesan
;
favorable
yesterday
,
she
may
turn
her
back
*NL*
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
that
you
now
hesitate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
hesitate
;
God
forbid
!
But
would
it
be
just
to
allow
me
to
*NL*
go
to
a
possible
death
without
having
given
me
at
least
something
more
*NL*
than
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
answered
by
a
glance
which
said
,
``
Is
that
all
?
--
speak
,
then
.
''
And
*NL*
then
accompanying
the
glance
with
explanatory
words
,
``
That
is
but
too
*NL*
just
,
''
said
she
,
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
an
angel
!
''
exclaimed
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
all
is
agreed
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
that
which
I
ask
of
you
,
dear
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
I
assure
you
that
you
may
rely
on
my
tenderness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
wait
till
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
I
hear
my
brother
.
It
will
be
useless
for
him
to
find
you
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rang
the
bell
and
Kitty
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
out
this
way
,
''
said
she
,
opening
a
small
private
door
,
``
and
come
*NL*
back
at
eleven
o'clock
;
we
will
then
terminate
this
conversation
.
Kitty
*NL*
will
conduct
you
to
my
chamber

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
girl
almost
fainted
at
hearing
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mademoiselle
,
what
are
you
thinking
about

standing
there

show
the

out
;

this
evening
at

eleven
o'clock

heard

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
these
appointments
are
all
made
for
eleven
o'clock

*NL*
thought
d'Artagnan
;
``
that
's
a
settled
custom

''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
held
out
her
hand
to
him
,
which
he
kissed
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

said
he
,
as
he
retired
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
reproaches
*NL*
of
Kitty
,
``
I
must
not
play
the
fool

This
woman
is
certainly
a
great

I
must
take
care

MILADY
'S
SECRET
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
left
the
hotel
instead
of
going
up
at
once
to
Kitty
's
*NL*
chamber
,
as
she
endeavored
to
persuade
him
to
do
--
and
that
for
two
*NL*
reasons
:
the
first
,
because
by
this
means
he
should
escape
reproaches
,
*NL*
recriminations
,
and
prayers
;
the
second
,
because
he
was
not
sorry
to
*NL*
have
an
opportunity
of
reading
his
own
thoughts
and
endeavoring
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
to
fathom
those
of
this
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
most
clear
in
the
matter
was
that
d'Artagnan
loved
Milady
like
*NL*
a
madman
,
and
that
she
did
not
love
him
at
all
.
In
an
instant
d'Artagnan
*NL*
perceived
that
the
best
way
in
which
he
could
act
would
be
to
go
home
*NL*
and
write
Milady
a
long
letter
,
in
which
he
would
confess
to
her
that
he
*NL*
and
de
Wardes
were
,
up
to
the
present
moment
absolutely
the
same
,
and
*NL*
that
consequently
he
could
not
undertake
,
without
committing
suicide
,
to
*NL*
kill
the
Comte
de
Wardes
.
But
he
also
was
spurred
on
by
a
ferocious
*NL*
desire
of
vengeance
.
He
wished
to
subdue
this
woman
in
his
own
name
;
and
*NL*
as
this
vengeance
appeared
to
him
to
have
a
certain
sweetness
in
it
,
he
*NL*
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
renounce
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
six
or
seven
times
round
the
Place
Royale
,
turning
at
every
*NL*
ten
steps
to
look
at
the
light
in
Milady
's
apartment
,
which
was
to
be
*NL*
seen
through
the
blinds
.
It
was
evident
that
this
time
the
young
woman
*NL*
was
not
in
such
haste
to
retire
to
her
apartment
as
she
had
been
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
light
disappeared
.
With
this
light
was
extinguished
the
*NL*
last
irresolution
in
the
heart
of
d'Artagnan
.
He
recalled
to
his
mind
*NL*
the
details
of
the
first
night
,
and
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
brain
on
*NL*
fire
he
re-entered
the
hotel
and
flew
toward
Kitty
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
girl
,
pale
as
death
and
trembling
in
all
her
limbs
,
wished
to
*NL*
delay
her
lover
;
but
Milady
,
with
her
ear
on
the
watch
,
had
heard
the
*NL*
noise
d'Artagnan
had
made
,
and
opening
the
door
,
said
,
``
Come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
of
such
incredible
immodesty
,
of
such
monstrous
effrontery
,
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
could
scarcely
believe
what
he
saw
or
what
he
heard
.
He
*NL*
imagined
himself
to
be
drawn
into
one
of
those
fantastic
intrigues
one
*NL*
meets
in
dreams
.
He
,
however
,
darted
not
the
less
quickly
toward
Milady
,
*NL*
yielding
to
that
magnetic
attraction
which
the
loadstone
exercises
over
*NL*
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
closed
after
them
Kitty
rushed
toward
it
.
Jealousy
,
fury
,
*NL*
offended
pride
,
all
the
passions
in
short
that
dispute
the
heart
of
an
*NL*
outraged
woman
in
love
,
urged
her
to
make
a
revelation
;
but
she
*NL*
reflected
that
she
would
be
totally
lost
if
she
confessed
having
*NL*
assisted
in
such
a
machination
,
and
above
all
,
that
d'Artagnan
would
*NL*
also
be
lost
to
her
forever
.
This
last
thought
of
love
counseled
her
to
*NL*
make
this
last
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
on
his
part
,
had
gained
the
summit
of
all
his
wishes
.
It
was
*NL*
no
longer
a
rival
who
was
beloved
;
it
was
himself
who
was
apparently
*NL*
beloved
.
A
secret
voice
whispered
to
him
,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
*NL*
that
he
was
but
an
instrument
of
vengeance
,
that
he
was
only
caressed
*NL*
till
he
had
given
death
;
but
pride
,
but
self-love
,
but
madness
silenced
*NL*
this
voice
and
stifled
its
murmurs
.
And
then
our
Gascon
,
with
that
large
*NL*
quantity
of
conceit
which
we
know
he
possessed
,
compared
himself
with
de
*NL*
Wardes
,
and
asked
himself
why
,
after
all
,
he
should
not
be
beloved
for
*NL*
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
absorbed
entirely
by
the
sensations
of
the
moment
.
Milady
was
no
*NL*
longer
for
him
that
woman
of
fatal
intentions
who
had
for
a
moment
*NL*
terrified
him
;
she
was
an
ardent
,
passionate
mistress
,
abandoning
*NL*
herself
to
love
which
she
also
seemed
to
feel
.
Two
hours
thus
glided
*NL*
away
.
When
the
transports
of
the
two
lovers
were
calmer
,
Milady
,
who
had
*NL*
not
the
same
motives
for
forgetfulness
that
d'Artagnan
had
,
was
the
*NL*
first
to
return
to
reality
,
and
asked
the
young
man
if
the
means
which
*NL*
were
on
the
morrow
to
bring
on
the
encounter
between
him
and
de
Wardes
*NL*
were
already
arranged
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
,
whose
ideas
had
taken
quite
another
course
,
forgot
*NL*
himself
like
a
fool
,
and
answered
gallantly
that
it
was
too
late
to
*NL*
think
about
duels
and
sword
thrusts
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
coldness
toward
the
only
interests
that
occupied
her
mind
terrified
*NL*
Milady
,
whose
questions
became
more
pressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
never
seriously
thought
of
this
impossible
*NL*
duel
,
endeavored
to
turn
the
conversation
;
but
he
could
not
succeed
.
*NL*
Milady
kept
him
within
the
limits
she
had
traced
beforehand
with
her
*NL*
irresistible
spirit
and
her
iron
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
fancied
himself
very
cunning
when
advising
Milady
to
*NL*
renounce
,
by
pardoning
de
Wardes
,
the
furious
projects
she
had
formed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
first
word
the
young
woman
started
,
and
exclaimed
in
a
sharp
,
*NL*
bantering
tone
,
which
sounded
strangely
in
the
darkness
,
``
Are
you
*NL*
afraid
,
dear
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
think
so
,
dear
love
!
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
now
,
suppose
*NL*
this
poor
Comte
de
Wardes
were
less
guilty
than
you
think
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
all
events
,
''
said
Milady
,
seriously
,
``
he
has
deceived
me
,
and
from
*NL*
the
moment
he
deceived
me
,
he
merited
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
die
,
then
,
since
you
condemn
him
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
in
so
firm
*NL*
a
tone
that
it
appeared
to
Milady
an
undoubted
proof
of
devotion
.
This
*NL*
reassured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
not
say
how
long
the
night
seemed
to
Milady
,
but
d'Artagnan
*NL*
believed
it
to
be
hardly
two
hours
before
the
daylight
peeped
through
*NL*
the
window
blinds
,
and
invaded
the
chamber
with
its
paleness
.
Seeing
*NL*
d'Artagnan
about
to
leave
her
,
Milady
recalled
his
promise
to
avenge
her
*NL*
on
the
Comte
de
Wardes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
ready
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
in
the
first
place
I
should
*NL*
like
to
be
certain
of
one
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
that
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
whether
you
really
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
you
proof
of
that
,
it
seems
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
yours
,
body
and
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
my
brave
lover
;
but
as
you
are
satisfied
of
my
love
,
you
must
,
*NL*
in
your
turn
,
satisfy
me
of
yours
.
Is
it
not
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
but
if
you
love
me
as
much
as
you
say
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
``
do
you
not
entertain
a
little
fear
on
my
account
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
I
may
be
dangerously
wounded
--
killed
even
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
cried
Milady
,
``
you
are
such
a
valiant
man
,
and
such
an
*NL*
expert
swordsman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
,
then
,
prefer
a
method
,
''
resumed
d'Artagnan
,
``
which
would
*NL*
equally
avenge
you
while
rendering
the
combat
useless
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
looked
at
her
lover
in
silence
.
The
pale
light
of
the
first
rays
*NL*
of
day
gave
to
her
clear
eyes
a
strangely
frightful
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
believe
you
now
begin
to
hesitate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
hesitate
;
but
I
really
pity
this
poor
Comte
de
Wardes
,
*NL*
since
you
have
ceased
to
love
him
.
I
think
that
a
man
must
be
so
*NL*
severely
punished
by
the
loss
of
your
love
that
he
stands
in
need
of
no
*NL*
other
chastisement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
that
I
loved
him
?
''
asked
Milady
,
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
I
am
now
at
liberty
to
believe
,
without
too
much
fatuity
,
*NL*
that
you
love
another
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
in
a
caressing
tone
,
``
and
I
*NL*
repeat
that
I
am
really
interested
for
the
count
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
alone
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
is
far
from
being
,
or
rather
having
been
,
so
guilty
toward
you
*NL*
as
he
appears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
said
Milady
,
in
an
anxious
tone
;
``
explain
yourself
,
for
I
*NL*
really
can
not
tell
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
looked
at
d'Artagnan
,
who
embraced
her
tenderly
,
with
eyes
which
*NL*
seemed
to
burn
themselves
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
a
man
of
honor
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
determined
to
come
to
an
*NL*
end
,
``
and
since
your
love
is
mine
,
and
I
am
satisfied
I
possess
it
--
for
*NL*
I
do
possess
it
,
do
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Entirely
;
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
feel
as
if
transformed
--
a
confession
weighs
on
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
confession
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
the
least
doubt
of
your
love
I
would
not
make
it
,
but
you
love
*NL*
me

my
beautiful
mistress
,
do
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
through
excess
of
love
I
have
rendered
myself
culpable
toward

you

you
will
pardon
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
tried
with
his
sweetest
smile
to
touch
his
lips
to
Milady
's
,
*NL*
but
she
evaded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
confession
,
''
said
she
,
growing
paler
,
``
what
is
this
confession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
de
Wardes
a
meeting
on
Thursday
last
in
this
very
room

did
*NL*
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
It
is
not
true
,
''
said
Milady
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
so
firm
,
and
*NL*
with
a
countenance
so
unchanged
,
that
if
d'Artagnan
had
not
been
in
such
*NL*
perfect
possession
of
the
fact
,
he
would
have
doubted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
lie
,
my
angel
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
smiling
;
``
that
would
be
*NL*
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
Speak
!
you
kill
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
;
you
are
not
guilty
toward
me
,
and
I
have
already
pardoned
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
what
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
Wardes
can
not
boast
of
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
You
told
me
yourself
that
that
ring
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ring
I
have
!
The
Comte
de
Wardes
of
Thursday
and
the
d'Artagnan
of
*NL*
today
are
the
same
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
imprudent
young
man
expected
a
surprise
,
mixed
with
shame
--
a
slight
*NL*
storm
which
would
resolve
itself
into
tears
;
but
he
was
strangely
*NL*
deceived
,
and
his
error
was
not
of
long
duration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pale
and
trembling
,
Milady
repulsed
d'Artagnan
's
attempted
embrace
by
a
*NL*
violent
blow
on
the
chest
,
as
she
sprang
out
of
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
broad
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
detained
her
by
her
night
dress
of
fine
India
linen
,
to
*NL*
implore
her
pardon
;
but
she
,
with
a
strong
movement
,
tried
to
escape
.
*NL*
Then
the
cambric
was
torn
from
her
beautiful
shoulders
;
and
on
one
of
*NL*
those
lovely
shoulders
,
round
and
white
,
d'Artagnan
recognized
,
with
*NL*
inexpressible
astonishment
,
the
FLEUR-DE-LIS
--
that
indelible
mark
which
*NL*
the
hand
of
the
infamous
executioner
had
imprinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
loosing
his
hold
of
her
dress
,
and
*NL*
remaining
mute
,
motionless
,
and
frozen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Milady
felt
herself
denounced
even
by
his
terror
.
He
had
doubtless
*NL*
seen
all
.
The
young
man
now
knew
her
secret
,
her
terrible
secret
--
the
*NL*
secret
she
concealed
even
from
her
maid
with
such
care
,
the
secret
of
*NL*
which
all
the
world
was
ignorant
,
except
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
upon
him
,
no
longer
like
a
furious
woman
,
but
like
a
wounded
*NL*
panther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
wretch
!
''
cried
she
,
``
you
have
basely
betrayed
me
,
and
still
more
,
*NL*
you
have
my
secret
!
You
shall
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
flew
to
a
little
inlaid
casket
which
stood
upon
the
dressing
*NL*
table
,
opened
it
with
a
feverish
and
trembling
hand
,
drew
from
it
a
*NL*
small
poniard
,
with
a
golden
haft
and
a
sharp
thin
blade
,
and
then
threw
*NL*
herself
with
a
bound
upon
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
young
man
was
brave
,
as
we
know
,
he
was
terrified
at
that
*NL*
wild
countenance
,
those
terribly
dilated
pupils
,
those
pale
cheeks
,
and
*NL*
those
bleeding
lips
.
He
recoiled
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
as
he
*NL*
would
have
done
from
a
serpent
which
was
crawling
toward
him
,
and
his
*NL*
sword
coming
in
contact
with
his
nervous
hand
,
he
drew
it
almost
*NL*
unconsciously
from
the
scabbard
.
But
without
taking
any
heed
of
the
*NL*
sword
,
Milady
endeavored
to
get
near
enough
to
him
to
stab
him
,
and
did
*NL*
not
stop
till
she
felt
the
sharp
point
at
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
tried
to
seize
the
sword
with
her
hands
;
but
d'Artagnan
kept
it
*NL*
free
from
her
grasp
,
and
presenting
the
point
,
sometimes
at
her
eyes
,
*NL*
sometimes
at
her
breast
,
compelled
her
to
glide
behind
the
bedstead
,
*NL*
while
he
aimed
at
making
his
retreat
by
the
door
which
led
to
Kitty
's
*NL*
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
during
this
time
continued
to
strike
at
him
with
horrible
fury
,
*NL*
screaming
in
a
formidable
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
all
this
,
however
,
bore
some
resemblance
to
a
duel
,
d'Artagnan
began
*NL*
to
recover
himself
little
by
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
beautiful
lady
,
very
well
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
,
PARDIEU
,
if
you
do
n't
*NL*
calm
yourself
,
I
will
design
a
second
FLEUR-DE-LIS
upon
one
of
those
*NL*
pretty
cheeks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scoundrel
,
infamous
scoundrel
!
''
howled
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
,
still
keeping
on
the
defensive
,
drew
near
to
Kitty
's
*NL*
door
.
At
the
noise
they
made
,
she
in
overturning
the
furniture
in
her
*NL*
efforts
to
get
at
him
,
he
in
screening
himself
behind
the
furniture
to
*NL*
keep
out
of
her
reach
,
Kitty
opened
the
door
.
D'Artagnan
,
who
had
*NL*
unceasingly
maneuvered
to
gain
this
point
,
was
not
at
more
than
three
*NL*
paces
from
it
.
With
one
spring
he
flew
from
the
chamber
of
Milady
into
*NL*
that
of
the
maid
,
and
quick
as
lightning
,
he
slammed
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
placed
all
his
weight
against
it
,
while
Kitty
pushed
the
bolts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Milady
attempted
to
tear
down
the
doorcase
,
with
a
strength
*NL*
apparently
above
that
of
a
woman
;
but
finding
she
could
not
accomplish
*NL*
this
,
she
in
her
fury
stabbed
at
the
door
with
her
poniard
,
the
point
of
*NL*
which
repeatedly
glittered
through
the
wood
.
Every
blow
was
accompanied
*NL*
with
terrible
imprecations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
Kitty
,
quick
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
bolts
were
fast
,
``
let
me
get
out
of
the
hotel
;
for
if
we
leave
her
time
*NL*
to
turn
round
,
she
will
have
me
killed
by
the
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
go
out
so
,
''
said
Kitty
;
``
you
are
naked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
then
first
thinking
of
the
costume
he
*NL*
found
himself
in
,
``
that
's
true
.
But
dress
me
as
well
as
you
are
able
,
*NL*
only
make
haste
;
think
,
my
dear
girl
,
it
's
life
and
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
but
too
well
aware
of
that
.
In
a
turn
of
the
hand
she
muffled
*NL*
him
up
in
a
flowered
robe
,
a
large
hood
,
and
a
cloak
.
She
gave
him
some
*NL*
slippers
,
in
which
he
placed
his
naked
feet
,
and
then
conducted
him
down
*NL*
the
stairs
.
It
was
time
.
Milady
had
already
rung
her
bell
,
and
roused
*NL*
the
whole
hotel
.
The
porter
was
drawing
the
cord
at
the
moment
Milady
*NL*
cried
from
her
window
,
``
Do
n't
open
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
fled
while
she
was
still
threatening
him
with
an
impotent
*NL*
gesture
.
The
moment
she
lost
sight
of
him
,
Milady
tumbled
fainting
into
*NL*
her
chamber
.

HOW
,
WITHOUT
INCOMMDING
HIMSELF
,
ATHOS
PROCURES
HIS
EQUIPMENT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
so
completely
bewildered
that
without
taking
any
heed
of
*NL*
what
might
become
of
Kitty
he
ran
at
full
speed
across
half
Paris
,
and
*NL*
did
not
stop
till
he
came
to
Athos
's
door
.
The
confusion
of
his
mind
,
*NL*
the
terror
which
spurred
him
on
,
the
cries
of
some
of
the
patrol
who
*NL*
started
in
pursuit
of
him
,
and
the
hooting
of
the
people
who
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
early
hour
,
were
going
to
their
work
,
only
made
him
*NL*
precipitate
his
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
the
court
,
ran
up
the
two
flights
to
Athos
's
apartment
,
and
*NL*
knocked
at
the
door
enough
to
break
it
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
came
,
rubbing
his
half-open
eyes
,
to
answer
this
noisy
summons
,
*NL*
and
d'Artagnan
sprang
with
such
violence
into
the
room
as
nearly
to
*NL*
overturn
the
astonished
lackey
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
habitual
silence
,
the
poor
lad
this
time
found
his
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holloa
,
there
!
''
cried
he
;
``
what
do
you
want
,
you
strumpet
?
What
's
your
*NL*
business
here
,
you
hussy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
threw
off
his
hood
,
and
disengaged
his
hands
from
the
folds
*NL*
of
the
cloak
.
At
sight
of
the
mustaches
and
the
naked
sword
,
the
poor
*NL*
devil
perceived
he
had
to
deal
with
a
man
.
He
then
concluded
it
must
be
*NL*
an
assassin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
murder
!
help
!
''
cried
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
stupid
fellow
!
''
said
the
young
man
;
``
I
am
*NL*
d'Artagnan

do
n't
you
know
me
?
Where
is
your
master
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
!
''
cried
Grimaud
,
``
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grimaud
,
''
said
Athos
,
coming
out
of
his
apartment
in
a
dressing
gown
,
*NL*
``
Grimaud
,
I
thought
I
heard
you
permitting
yourself
to
speak

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

monsieur
,
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

''
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
contented
himself
with
pointing
d'Artagnan
out
to
his
master
*NL*
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
recognized
his
comrade
,
and
phlegmatic
as
he
was
,
he
burst
into
a
*NL*
laugh
which
was
quite
excused
by
the
strange
masquerade
before
his
*NL*
eyes
--
petticoats
falling
over
his
shoes
,
sleeves
tucked
up
,
and
*NL*
mustaches
stiff
with
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
,
my
friend
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
;
``
for
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
*NL*
laugh
,
for
upon
my
soul
,
it
's
no
laughing
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pronounced
these
words
with
such
a
solemn
air
and
with
such
a
*NL*
real
appearance
of
terror
,
that
Athos
eagerly
seized
his
hand
,
crying
,
*NL*
``
Are
you
wounded
,
my
friend
?
How
pale
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,

I
have
just
met
with
a
terrible
adventure

Are
you
alone

*NL*
Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
PARBLEU

whom
do
you
expect
to
find
with
me
at
this
hour

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well
!
''
and
d'Artagnan
rushed
into
Athos
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
speak
!
''
said
the
latter
,
closing
the
door
and
bolting
it
,
that
*NL*
they
might
not
be
disturbed
.
``
Is
the
king
dead

Have
you
killed

cardinal

You
are
quite
upset

Come

me

I
am
dying
with

curiosity

uneasiness

*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos

''
said
d'Artagnan
,
getting
rid
of
his
female
garments
,
and
*NL*
appearing
in
his
shirt
,
``
prepare
yourself
to
hear
an
incredible

an

unheard-of
story

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

put
on
this
dressing
gown
first

said
the
Musketeer
to
his
*NL*
friend

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
donned
the
robe
as
quickly
as
he
could
,
mistaking
one
sleeve
*NL*
for
the
other
,
so
greatly
was
he
still
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?

said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

replied
d'Artagnan
,
bending
his
mouth
to
Athos
's
ear
,
and
*NL*
lowering
his
voice
,
``
Milady
is
marked
with
a
FLEUR-DE-LIS
upon
her
*NL*
shoulder
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!

cried
the
Musketeer
,
as
if
he
had
received
a
ball
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see

said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Are
you
SURE
that
the

dead

*NL*
*NL*
``
THE

said
Athos
,
in
so
stifled
a
voice
that
d'Artagnan
scarcely
*NL*
heard
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
of

you
told
me
one

*NL*
*NL*
Athos
uttered
a
groan

let
his
head
sink
on
his
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

a

*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
related

*NL*
*NL*

In

London

he
entertains
a
great

bring
back

Grimaud
replied

set
off

magnificent

At

Grimaud
returned

accompanied

the

anxious

taken
advantage

brought
the
garments
himself

D'Artagnan
dressed
himself

Athos
did
the

.
When
the
two
were
*NL*
ready
to
go
out
,
the
latter
made
Grimaud
the
sign
of
a
man
taking
aim
,
*NL*
and
the
lackey
immediately
took
down
his
musketoon
,
and
prepared
to
*NL*
follow
his
master

*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
without
accident
at
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs

Bonacieux
was
*NL*
standing
at
the
door

looked
at
d'Artagnan
hatefully

*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste

said
he
;

there

pretty

*NL*
*NL*

That

Kitty

said
d'Artagnan
to
himself

darted
into
the
passage

*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
!
Upon
the
landing
leading
to
the
chamber
,
and
crouching
*NL*
against
the
door

he
found
the
poor
girl
,
all
in
a
tremble

As
soon
as
*NL*
she
perceived
him

she
cried

You

*NL*
*NL*

Kitty

The

She

There

Then
I

*NL*
Aramis

Request
him
to
come
here
directly
.
We
have
something
very
*NL*
important
to
say
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
but
why
not
Porthos
?
I
should
have
thought
*NL*
that
his
duchess
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Porthos
's
duchess
is
dressed
by
her
husband
's
clerks
,
''
said
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
laughing
.
``
Besides
,
Kitty
would
not
like
to
live
in
the
Rue
*NL*
aux
Ours
.
Is
n't
it
so
,
Kitty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
care
where
I
live
,
''
said
Kitty
,
``
provided
I
am
well
concealed
,
*NL*
and
nobody
knows
where
I
am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
Kitty
,
when
we
are
about
to
separate
,
and
you
are
no
longer
*NL*
jealous
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Chevalier
,
far
off
or
near
,
''
said
Kitty
,
``
I
shall
always
love
*NL*
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
devil
will
constancy
niche
itself
next
?

murmured
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
also
,

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
also
.
I
shall
always
love
you
;
be
*NL*
sure
of
that
.
But
now
answer
me
.
I
attach
great
importance
to
the
*NL*
question
I
am
about
to
put
to
you
.
Did
you
never
hear
talk
of
a
young
*NL*
woman
who
was
carried
off
one
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
!
Oh
,
Monsieur
Chevalier
,
do
you
love
that
woman
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
it
is
one
of
my
friends
who
loves
her
--
Monsieur
Athos
,
this
*NL*
gentleman
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
cried
Athos
,
with
an
accent
like
that
of
a
man
who
perceives
he
is
*NL*
about
to
tread
upon
an
adder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
to
be
sure
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
pressing
Athos
's
hand
.
``
You
know
the
*NL*
interest
we
both
take
in
this
poor
little
Madame
Bonacieux

Besides
,
*NL*
Kitty
will
tell
nothing
;
will
you
,
Kitty
?
You
understand
,
my
dear
girl
,
''
*NL*
continued
d'Artagnan
,
``
she
is
the
wife
of
that
frightful
baboon
you
saw
*NL*
at
the
door
as
you
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God

You
remind
me
of
my
fright

If
he
should
have
known
me
*NL*
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
know
you
again
?
Did
you
ever
see
that
man
before
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
twice
to
Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it

About
what
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
about
fifteen
or
eighteen
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yesterday
evening
he
came
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
just
before
you
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Athos

we
are
enveloped
in
a
network
of
spies

And
do
you

believe

knew
you
again
,
Kitty

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pulled
down
my
hood
as
soon
as
I
saw
him

perhaps
it
was
too
*NL*
late
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
down
,
Athos
--
he
mistrusts
you
less
than
me

and
see
if
he
be
still
*NL*
at
his
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
went
down
and
returned
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
gone
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
the
house
door
is
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
gone
to
make
his
report
,
and
to
say
that
all
the
pigeons
are
at
*NL*
this
moment
in
the
dovecot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
us
all
fly
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
and
leave
nobody
here
but
*NL*
Planchet
to
bring
us
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
minute
.
Aramis
,
whom
we
have
sent
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
we
must
wait
for
Aramis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Aramis
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
matter
was
all
explained
to
him
,
and
the
friends
gave
him
to
*NL*
understand
that
among
all
his
high
connections
he
must
find
a
place
for
*NL*
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
reflected
for
a
minute
,
and
then
said
,
coloring
,
``
Will
it
be
*NL*
really
rendering
you
a
service
,
d'Artagnan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
grateful
to
you
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Madame
de
Bois-Tracy
asked
me
,
for
one
of
her
friends
who
*NL*
resides
in
the
provinces
,
I
believe
,
for
a
trustworthy
maid
.
If
you
can
,
*NL*
my
dear
d'Artagnan
,
answer
for
Mademoiselle
-
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
monsieur
,
be
assured
that
I
shall
be
entirely
devoted
to
the
person
*NL*
who
will
give
me
the
means
of
quitting
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
this
falls
out
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
himself
at
the
table
and
wrote
a
little
note
which
he
sealed
*NL*
with
a
ring
,
and
gave
the
billet
to
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
dear
girl
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
know
that
it
is
not
good
*NL*
for
any
of
us
to
be
here
.
Therefore
let
us
separate
.
We
shall
meet
again
*NL*
in
better
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whenever
we
find
each
other
,
in
whatever
place
it
may
be
,
''
said
*NL*
Kitty
,
``
you
will
find
me
loving
you
as
I
love
you
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dicers
'
oaths
!
''
said
Athos
,
while
d'Artagnan
went
to
conduct
Kitty
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
afterward
the
three
young
men
separated
,
agreeing
to
meet
*NL*
again
at
four
o'clock
with
Athos
,
and
leaving
Planchet
to
guard
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
returned
home
,
and
Athos
and
d'Artagnan
busied
themselves
about
*NL*
pledging
the
sapphire
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Gascon
had
foreseen
,
they
easily
obtained
three
hundred
pistoles
*NL*
on
the
ring
.
Still
further
,
the
Jew
told
them
that
if
they
would
sell
it
*NL*
to
him
,
as
it
would
make
a
magnificent
pendant
for
earrings
,
he
would
*NL*
give
five
hundred
pistoles
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
and
d'Artagnan
,
with
the
activity
of
two
soldiers
and
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
two
connoisseurs
,
hardly
required
three
hours
to
purchase
*NL*
the
entire
equipment
of
the
Musketeer
.
Besides
,
Athos
was
very
easy
,
and
*NL*
a
noble
to
his
fingers
'
ends
.
When
a
thing
suited
him
he
paid
the
price
*NL*
demanded
,
without
thinking
to
ask
for
any
abatement
.
D'Artagnan
would
*NL*
have
remonstrated
at
this
;
but
Athos
put
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
and
d'Artagnan
understood
that
it
was
all
very
well
for
*NL*
such
a
little
Gascon
gentleman
as
himself
to
drive
a
bargain
,
but
not
*NL*
for
a
man
who
had
the
bearing
of
a
prince
.
The
Musketeer
met
with
a
*NL*
superb
Andalusian
horse
,
black
as
jet
,
nostrils
of
fire
,
legs
clean
and
*NL*
elegant
,
rising
six
years
.
He
examined
him
,
and
found
him
sound
and
*NL*
without
blemish
.
They
asked
a
thousand
livres
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
perhaps
have
been
bought
for
less
;
but
while
d'Artagnan
was
*NL*
discussing
the
price
with
the
dealer
,
Athos
was
counting
out
the
money
*NL*
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
had
a
stout
,
short
Picard
cob
,
which
cost
three
hundred
livres
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
saddle
and
arms
for
Grimaud
were
purchased
,
Athos
had
not
a
*NL*
sou
left
of
his
hundred
and
fifty
pistoles
.
D'Artagnan
offered
his
*NL*
friend
a
part
of
his
share
which
he
should
return
when
convenient
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Athos
only
replied
to
this
proposal
by
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
did
the
Jew
say
he
would
give
for
the
sapphire
if
he
purchased
*NL*
it
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
hundred
pistoles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
two
hundred
more
--
a
hundred
pistoles
for
you
and
a
*NL*
hundred
pistoles
for
me
.
Well
,
now
,
that
would
be
a
real
fortune
to
us
,
*NL*
my
friend
;
let
us
go
back
to
the
Jew
's
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
will
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
ring
would
certainly
only
recall
very
bitter
remembrances
;
then
we
*NL*
shall
never
be
masters
of
three
hundred
pistoles
to
redeem
it
,
so
that
*NL*
we
really
should
lose
two
hundred
pistoles
by
the
bargain
.
Go
and
tell
*NL*
him
the
ring
is
his
,
d'Artagnan
,
and
bring
back
the
two
hundred
pistoles
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reflect
,
Athos
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
money
is
needful
for
the
present
time
,
and
we
must
learn
how
to
*NL*
make
sacrifices
.
Go
,
d'Artagnan
,
go
;
Grimaud
will
accompany
you
with
his
*NL*
musketoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
half
hour
afterward
,
d'Artagnan
returned
with
the
two
thousand
livres
,
*NL*
and
without
having
met
with
any
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
Athos
found
at
home
resources
which
he
did
not
expect
.

A
VISION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
the
four
friends
were
all
assembled
with
Athos
.
Their
*NL*
anxiety
about
their
outfits
had
all
disappeared
,
and
each
countenance
*NL*
only
preserved
the
expression
of
its
own
secret
disquiet
--
for
behind
all
*NL*
present
happiness
is
concealed
a
fear
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Planchet
entered
,
bringing
two
letters
for
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
was
a
little
billet
,
genteelly
folded
,
with
a
pretty
seal
in
*NL*
green
wax
on
which
was
impressed
a
dove
bearing
a
green
branch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
was
a
large
square
epistle
,
resplendent
with
the
terrible
arms
*NL*
of
his
Eminence
the
cardinal
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
the
little
letter
the
heart
of
d'Artagnan
bounded
,
for
*NL*
he
believed
he
recognized
the
handwriting
,
and
although
he
had
seen
that
*NL*
writing
but
once
,
the
memory
of
it
remained
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
therefore
seized
the
little
epistle
,
and
opened
it
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
,
''
said
the
letter
,
``
on
Thursday
next
,
at
from
six
to
seven
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
on
the
road
to
Chaillot
,
and
look
carefully
into
the
*NL*
carriages
that
pass
;
but
if
you
have
any
consideration
for
your
own
life
*NL*
or
that
of
those
who
love
you
,
do
not
speak
a
single
word
,
do
not
make
a
*NL*
movement
which
may
lead
anyone
to
believe
you
have
recognized
her
who
*NL*
exposes
herself
to
everything
for
the
sake
of
seeing
you
but
for
an
*NL*
instant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
signature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
snare
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
do
n't
go
,
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
think
I
recognize
the
writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
counterfeit
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
Between
six
and
seven
o'clock
the
*NL*
road
of
Chaillot
is
quite
deserted
;
you
might
as
well
go
and
ride
in
the
*NL*
forest
of
Bondy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
we
all
go
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
what
the
devil
!
They
wo
n't
*NL*
devour
us
all
four
,
four
lackeys
,
horses
,
arms
,
and
all
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides
,
it
will
be
a
chance
for
displaying
our
new
equipments
,

*NL*
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
it
is
a
woman
who
writes
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
and
that
woman
desires
*NL*
not
to
be
seen
,
remember
,
you
compromise
her
,
d'Artagnan
;
which
is
not
*NL*
the
part
of
a
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
remain
in
the
background
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
and
he
will
advance
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
a
pistol
shot
is
easily
fired
from
a
carriage
which
goes
at
a
*NL*
gallop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
they
will
miss
me
;
if
they
fire
we
will
ride
*NL*
after
the
carriage
,
and
exterminate
those
who
may
be
in
it
.
They
must
be
*NL*
enemies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
right
,
''
said
Porthos
;
``
battle
.
Besides
,
we
must
try
our
own
*NL*
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
let
us
enjoy
that
pleasure
,
''
said
Aramis
,
with
his
mild
and
*NL*
careless
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
is
half
past
four
,
and
we
have
*NL*
scarcely
time
to
be
on
the
road
of
Chaillot
by
six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
if
we
go
out
too
late
,
nobody
will
see
us

said
Porthos
,
``
and
*NL*
that
will
be
a
pity

Let
us
get
ready

gentlemen

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
second
letter

said
Athos
,
``
you
forget
that
;
it
appears
to

me

however

that
the
seal
denotes
that
it
deserves
to
be
opened
.
For
my
*NL*
part
,
I
declare
,
d'Artagnan
,
I
think
it
of
much
more
consequence
than
*NL*
the
little
piece
of
waste
paper
you
have
so
cunningly
slipped
into
your
*NL*
bosom

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
he
,
``

and
d'Artagnan
unsealed
the
letter
and
read
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

here
's
a

much
more
serious
than
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
to
the

is
for

for
both

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
I
would
not
go

all

said
Aramis
.
``
A
gallant
knight
can
not

decline
a
rendezvous
with
a
lady

but
a
prudent
gentleman
may
excuse

himself
from
not
waiting
on
his
Eminence
,
particularly
when
he
has
*NL*
reason
to
believe
he
is
not
invited
to
make
his
compliments
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
Aramis

opinion

Porthos
.

*NL*
``

d'Artagnan
,
``
I
have
already
received
by
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Cavois
a
similar
invitation
from
his
Eminence

I
neglected
it
,
and
on
*NL*
the
morrow
a
serious
misfortune
happened
to
me
--
Constance
disappeared

*NL*
Whatever
may
ensue
,
I
will
go

*NL*
*NL*

If

*NL*
*NL*

Bah
!
you
will
get
me
out

put
me
there

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
we
will

replied
Aramis
and
Porthos
,
with
admirable
*NL*
promptness
and
decision
,
as
if
that
were
the
simplest
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
,
``
to
be
sure
we
will
get
you
out
;
but
meantime
,
as
we
are
to
set
*NL*
off
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
you
would
do
much
better
not
to
risk
this
*NL*
Bastille
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
do
better
than
that
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
do
not
let
us
leave
him
*NL*
during
the
whole
evening
.
Let
each
of
us
wait
at
a
gate
of
the
palace
*NL*
with
three
Musketeers
behind
him
;
if
we
see
a
close
carriage
,
at
all
*NL*
suspicious
in
appearance
,
come
out
,
let
us
fall
upon
it
.
It
is
a
long
*NL*
time
since
we
have
had
a
skirmish
with
the
Guards
of
Monsieur
the
*NL*
Cardinal
;
Monsieur
de
Treville
must
think
us
dead
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
certainty

Athos

Aramis

``
you
were
meant

What
do

think
of
the
plan

gentlemen
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Admirable
!

replied
the
young
men
in
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

said
Porthos
,
``
I
will
run
to
the
hotel

engage

hold
themselves
in
readiness
by
eight
o'clock
;
the
rendezvous
,
the
*NL*
Place
du

Meantime
,
you
see
that
the
lackeys
saddle
the
*NL*
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
horse
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
that
is
of
no
consequence

I
*NL*
can
take
one
of
Monsieur
de
Treville

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
worth
while

said
Aramis
,
``
you
can
have
one
of
mine
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
yours
!
how
many
have
you
,
then
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three

''
replied
Aramis
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certes

cried
Athos
,
``
you
are

best-mounted

France

Navarre

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Aramis
,
you
do

want
three
horses

I
can
not
comprehend
*NL*
what
induced
you
to
buy
three
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
I
only
purchased
two
,
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
third
,
then
,
fell
from
the
clouds
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
third
was
brought
to
me
this
very
morning
by
a
groom
out
of
*NL*
livery
,
who
would
not
tell
me
in
whose
service
he
was
,
and
who
said
he
*NL*
had
received
orders
from
his
master
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
his
mistress

interrupted
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
no
difference

said
Aramis

coloring
;
``
and
who
affirmed
,
as
*NL*
I
said
,
that
he
had
received
orders
from
his
master

place
*NL*
the
horse
in
my
stable
,
without
informing
me
whence
it
came

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
to
poets

such
things
happen

said
Athos
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
that
case

we
can
manage
famously

said
d'Artagnan
;
``
which
of
*NL*
the
two
horses
will
you
ride
--
that
which
you
bought

the
one
that
was

given
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
which
was
given

me

You
can
not
for

d'Artagnan

I
would
commit
such
an
offense
toward
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
unknown
giver

interrupted
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
the
mysterious
benefactress

said
Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one

then
become
useless
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
selected
it
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
the
greatest
care

The
safety
of
the
horseman

you
know

depends
*NL*
almost
always
upon

of
his
horse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

transfer
it
to
me
at
the
price

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
make
you
the
offer

giving
you
all
*NL*
the
time
necessary
for
repaying
me
such
a
trifle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
did
it
cost
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
hundred
livres

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
forty
double
pistoles

my

said
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
taking
the
sum
from
his
pocket
;
``
I
know
that
is
the
coin
in
which
you
*NL*
were
paid
for
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rich
?
Richest
,
my
dear
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
chinked
the
remainder
of
his
pistoles
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
your
saddle
,
then
,
to
the
hotel
of
the
Musketeers
,
and
your
horse
*NL*
can
be
brought
back
with
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
but
it
is
already
five
o'clock
,
so
make
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
Porthos
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Ferou
on
a
very
handsome
genet
.
Mousqueton
followed
him
upon
an
Auvergne
*NL*
horse
,
small
but
very
handsome
.
Porthos
was
resplendent
with
joy
and
*NL*
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
Aramis
made
his
appearance
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
street
upon
a
superb
English
charger
.
Bazin
followed
him
upon
a
roan
,
*NL*
holding
by
the
halter
a
vigorous
Mecklenburg
horse
;
this
was
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
mount
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Musketeers
met
at
the
gate
.
Athos
and
d'Artagnan
watched
their
*NL*
approach
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
cried
Aramis
,
``
you
have
a
magnificent
horse
there
,
*NL*
Porthos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Porthos
,
``
it
is
the
one
that
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
*NL*
me
at
first
.
A
bad
joke
of
the
husband
's
substituted
the
other
;
but
the
*NL*
husband
has
been
punished
since
,
and
I
have
obtained
full
satisfaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
and
Grimaud
appeared
in
their
turn
,
leading
their
masters
'
*NL*
steeds
.
D'Artagnan
and
Athos
put
themselves
into
saddle
with
their
*NL*
companions
,
and
all
four
set
forward
;
Athos
upon
a
horse
he
owed
to
a
*NL*
woman
,
Aramis
on
a
horse
he
owed
to
his
mistress
,
Porthos
on
a
horse
he
*NL*
owed
to
his
procurator
's
wife
,
and
d'Artagnan
on
a
horse
he
owed
to
his
*NL*
good
fortune
--
the
best
mistress
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lackeys
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Porthos
had
foreseen
,
the
cavalcade
produced
a
good
effect
;
and
if
*NL*
Mme.
Coquenard
had
met
Porthos
and
seen
what
a
superb
appearance
he
made
*NL*
upon
his
handsome
Spanish
genet
,
she
would
not
have
regretted
the
*NL*
bleeding
she
had
inflicted
upon
the
strongbox
of
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
Louvre
the
four
friends
met
with
M.
de
Treville
,
who
was
*NL*
returning
from
St.
Germain
;
he
stopped
them
to
offer
his
compliments
*NL*
upon
their
appointments
,
which
in
an
instant
drew
round
them
a
hundred
*NL*
gapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
profited
by
the
circumstance
to
speak
to
M.
de
Treville
of
*NL*
the
letter
with
the
great
red
seal
and
the
cardinal
's
arms
.
It
is
well
*NL*
understood
that
he
did
not
breathe
a
word
about
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
approved
of
the
resolution
he
had
adopted
,
and
assured
him
*NL*
that
if
on
the
morrow
he
did
not
appear
,
he
himself
would
undertake
to
*NL*
find
him
,
let
him
be
where
he
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
clock
of
La
Samaritaine
struck
six
;
the
four
friends
*NL*
pleaded
an
engagement
,
and
took
leave
of
M.
de
Treville
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
gallop
brought
them
to
the
road
of
Chaillot
;
the
day
began
to
*NL*
decline
,
carriages
were
passing
and
repassing
.
D'Artagnan
,
keeping
at
*NL*
some
distance
from
his
friends
,
darted
a
scrutinizing
glance
into
every
*NL*
carriage
that
appeared
,
but
saw
no
face
with
which
he
was
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
after
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
just
as
twilight
was
*NL*
beginning
to
thicken
,
a
carriage
appeared
,
coming
at
a
quick
pace
on
the
*NL*
road
of
Sevres
.
A
presentiment
instantly
told
d'Artagnan
that
this
*NL*
carriage
contained
the
person
who
had
appointed
the
rendezvous
;
the
*NL*
young
man
was
himself
astonished
to
find
his
heart
beat
so
violently
.
*NL*
Almost
instantly
a
female
head
was
put
out
at
the
window
,
with
two
*NL*
fingers
placed
upon
her
mouth
,
either
to
enjoin
silence
or
to
send
him
a
*NL*
kiss
.
D'Artagnan
uttered
a
slight
cry
of
joy
;
this
woman
,
or
rather
this
*NL*
apparition
--
for
the
carriage
passed
with
the
rapidity
of
a
vision
--
was
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
an
involuntary
movement
and
in
spite
of
the
injunction
given
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
put
his
horse
into
a
gallop
,
and
in
a
few
strides
overtook
*NL*
the
carriage
;
but
the
window
was
hermetically
closed
,
the
vision
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
remembered
the
injunction
:
``
If
you
value
your
own
life
*NL*
or
that
of
those
who
love
you
,
remain
motionless
,
and
as
if
you
had
seen
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
,
therefore
,
trembling
not
for
himself
but
for
the
poor
woman
*NL*
who
had
evidently
exposed
herself
to
great
danger
by
appointing
this
*NL*
rendezvous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
pursued
its
way
,
still
going
at
a
great
pace
,
till
it
*NL*
dashed
into
Paris
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
fixed
to
the
spot
,
astounded
and
not
knowing
what
to
*NL*
think
.
If
it
was
Mme.
Bonacieux
and
if
she
was
returning
to
Paris
,
why
*NL*
this
fugitive
rendezvous
,
why
this
simple
exchange
of
a
glance
,
why
this
*NL*
lost
kiss
?
If
,
on
the
other
side
,
it
was
not
she
--
which
was
still
quite
*NL*
possible
--
for
the
little
light
that
remained
rendered
a
mistake
*NL*
easy
--
might
it
not
be
the
commencement
of
some
plot
against
him
through
*NL*
the
allurement
of
this
woman
,
for
whom
his
love
was
known
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
three
companions
joined
him
.
All
had
plainly
seen
a
woman
's
head
*NL*
appear
at
the
window
,
but
none
of
them
,
except
Athos
,
knew
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
.
The
opinion
of
Athos
was
that
it
was
indeed
she
;
but
less
*NL*
preoccupied
by
that
pretty
face
than
d'Artagnan
,
he
had
fancied
he
saw
a
*NL*
second
head
,
a
man
's
head
,
inside
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
the
case
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
they
are
doubtless
transporting
*NL*
her
from
one
prison
to
another
.
But
what
can
they
intend
to
do
with
the
*NL*
poor
creature
,
and
how
shall
I
ever
meet
her
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
,
''
said
Athos
,
gravely
,
``
remember
that
it
is
the
dead
alone
with
*NL*
whom
we
are
not
likely
to
meet
again
on
this
earth
.
You
know
something
*NL*
of
that
,
as
well
as
I
do
,
I
think
.
Now
,
if
your
mistress
is
not
dead
,
if
*NL*
it
is
she
we
have
just
seen
,
you
will
meet
with
her
again
some
day
or
*NL*
other
.
And
perhaps
,
my
God
!
''
added
he
,
with
that
misanthropic
tone
which
*NL*
was
peculiar
to
him
,
``
perhaps
sooner
than
you
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
past
seven
had
sounded
.
The
carriage
had
been
twenty
minutes
behind
*NL*
the
time
appointed
.
D'Artagnan
's
friends
reminded
him
that
he
had
a
*NL*
visit
to
pay
,
but
at
the
same
time
bade
him
observe
that
there
was
yet
*NL*
time
to
retract
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
was
at
the
same
time
impetuous
and
curious
.
He
had
made
*NL*
up
his
mind
that
he
would
go
to
the
Palais-Cardinal
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
learn
what
his
Eminence
had
to
say
to
him
.
Nothing
could
turn
him
from
*NL*
his
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
Rue
St.
Honore
,
and
in
the
Place
du
Palais-Cardinal
*NL*
they
found
the
twelve
invited
Musketeers
,
walking
about
in
expectation
*NL*
of
their
comrades
.
There
only
they
explained
to
them
the
matter
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
well
known
among
the
honorable
corps
of
the
king
's
*NL*
Musketeers
,
in
which
it
was
known
he
would
one
day
take
his
place
;
he
*NL*
was
considered
beforehand
as
a
comrade
.
It
resulted
from
these
*NL*
antecedents
that
everyone
entered
heartily
into
the
purpose
for
which
*NL*
they
met
;
besides
,
it
would
not
be
unlikely
that
they
would
have
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
playing
either
the
cardinal
or
his
people
an
ill
turn
,
*NL*
and
for
such
expeditions
these
worthy
gentlemen
were
always
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
divided
them
into
three
groups
,
assumed
the
command
of
one
,
gave
*NL*
the
second
to
Aramis
,
and
the
third
to
Porthos
;
and
then
each
group
went
*NL*
and
took
their
watch
near
an
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
on
his
part
,
entered
boldly
at
the
principal
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
felt
himself
ably
supported
,
the
young
man
was
not
without
a
*NL*
little
uneasiness
as
he
ascended
the
great
staircase
,
step
by
step
.
His
*NL*
conduct
toward
Milady
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
treachery
,
and
he
was
*NL*
very
suspicious
of
the
political
relations
which
existed
between
that
*NL*
woman
and
the
cardinal
.
Still
further
,
de
Wardes
,
whom
he
had
treated
so
*NL*
ill
,
was
one
of
the
tools
of
his
Eminence
;
and
d'Artagnan
knew
that
*NL*
while
his
Eminence
was
terrible
to
his
enemies
,
he
was
strongly
attached
*NL*
to
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
de
Wardes
has
related
all
our
affair
to
the
cardinal
,
which
is
not
*NL*
to
be
doubted
,
and
if
he
has
recognized
me
,
as
is
probable
,
I
may
*NL*
consider
myself
almost
as
a
condemned
man
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
.
``
But
why
has
he
waited
till
now
?
That
's
all
plain
enough
.
Milady
*NL*
has
laid
her
complaints
against
me
with
that
hypocritical
grief
which
*NL*
renders
her
so
interesting
,
and
this
last
offense
has
made
the
cup
*NL*
overflow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
,
''
added
he
,
``
my
good
friends
are
down
yonder
,
and
they
will
*NL*
not
allow
me
to
be
carried
away
without
a
struggle
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Treville
's
company
of
Musketeers
alone
can
not
maintain
a
war
*NL*
against
the
cardinal
,
who
disposes
of
the
forces
of
all
France
,
and
*NL*
before
whom
the
queen
is
without
power
and
the
king
without
will
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
my
friend
,
you
are
brave
,
you
are
prudent
,
you
have
*NL*
excellent
qualities
;
but
the
women
will
ruin
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
this
melancholy
conclusion
as
he
entered
the
antechamber
.
He
*NL*
placed
his
letter
in
the
hands
of
the
usher
on
duty
,
who
led
him
into
*NL*
the
waiting
room
and
passed
on
into
the
interior
of
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
waiting
room
were
five
or
six
of
the
cardinals
Guards
,
who
*NL*
recognized
d'Artagnan
,
and
knowing
that
it
was
he
who
had
wounded
*NL*
Jussac
,
they
looked
upon
him
with
a
smile
of
singular
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
smile
appeared
to
d'Artagnan
to
be
of
bad
augury
.
Only
,
as
our
*NL*
Gascon
was
not
easily
intimidated
--
or
rather
,
thanks
to
a
great
pride
*NL*
natural
to
the
men
of
his
country
,
he
did
not
allow
one
easily
to
see
*NL*
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
when
that
which
was
passing
at
all
*NL*
resembled
fear
--
he
placed
himself
haughtily
in
front
of
Messieurs
the
*NL*
Guards
,
and
waited
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
,
in
an
attitude
by
no
means
*NL*
deficient
in
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
returned
and
made
a
sign
to
d'Artagnan
to
follow
him
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
the
young
man
that
the
Guards
,
on
seeing
him
depart
,
*NL*
chuckled
among
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
traversed
a
corridor
,
crossed
a
grand
saloon
,
entered
a
library
,
and
*NL*
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
man
seated
at
a
desk
and
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
introduced
him
,
and
retired
without
speaking
a
word
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
standing
and
examined
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
at
first
believed
that
he
had
to
do
with
some
judge
examining
*NL*
his
papers
;
but
he
perceived
that
the
man
at
the
desk
wrote
,
or
rather
*NL*
corrected
,
lines
of
unequal
length
,
scanning
the
words
on
his
fingers
.
*NL*
He
saw
then
that
he
was
with
a
poet
.
At
the
end
of
an
instant
the
poet
*NL*
closed
his
manuscript
,
upon
the
cover
of
which
was
written
``
Mirame
,
a
*NL*
Tragedy
in
Five
Acts
,
''
and
raised
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
recognized
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
40
A
TERRIBLE
VISION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
leaned
his
elbow
on
his
manuscript
,
his
cheek
upon
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
looked
intently
at
the
young
man
for
a
moment
.
No
one
had
a
*NL*
more
searching
eye
than
the
Cardinal
de
Richelieu
,
and
d'Artagnan
felt
*NL*
this
glance
run
through
his
veins
like
a
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
however
kept
a
good
countenance
,
holding
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
*NL*
awaiting
the
good
pleasure
of
his
Eminence
,
without
too
much
assurance
,
*NL*
but
also
without
too
much
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
are
you
a
d'Artagnan
from
Bearn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
several
branches
of
the
d'Artagnans
at
Tarbes
and
in
its
*NL*
environs
,
''
said
the
cardinal
;
``
to
which
do
you
belong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
son
of
him
who
served
in
the
Religious
Wars
under
the
great
*NL*
King
Henry
,
the
father
of
his
gracious
Majesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
.
It
is
you
who
set
out
seven
or
eight
months
ago
from
your
*NL*
country
to
seek
your
fortune
in
the
capital
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
through
Meung
,
where
something
befell
you
.
I
do
n't
very
well
*NL*
know
what
,
but
still
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
this
was
what
happened
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
never
mind
!
''
resumed
the
cardinal
,
with
a
smile
which
*NL*
indicated
that
he
knew
the
story
as
well
as
he
who
wished
to
relate
it
.
*NL*
``
You
were
recommended
to
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
were
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
;
but
in
that
unfortunate
affair
at
Meung
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
was
lost
,
''
replied
his
Eminence
;
``
yes
,
I
know
that
.
But
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Treville
is
a
skilled
physiognomist
,
who
knows
men
at
first
*NL*
sight
;
and
he
placed
you
in
the
company
of
his
brother-in-law
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Dessessart
,
leaving
you
to
hope
that
one
day
or
other
you
should
enter
*NL*
the
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
is
correctly
informed
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
that
time
many
things
have
happened
to
you
.
You
were
walking
one
*NL*
day
behind
the
Chartreux
,
when
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
been
*NL*
elsewhere
.
Then
you
took
with
your
friends
a
journey
to
the
waters
of
*NL*
Forges
;
they
stopped
on
the
road
,
but
you
continued
yours
.
That
is
all
*NL*
very
simple
:
you
had
business
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
quite
confused
,
``
I
went
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hunting
at
Windsor
,
or
elsewhere
--
that
concerns
nobody
.
I
know
,
because
*NL*
it
is
my
office
to
know
everything
.
On
your
return
you
were
received
by
*NL*
an
august
personage
,
and
I
perceive
with
pleasure
that
you
preserve
the
*NL*
souvenir
she
gave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
placed
his
hand
upon
the
queen
's
diamond
,
which
he
wore
,
and
*NL*
quickly
turned
the
stone
inward
;
but
it
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
after
that
,
you
received
a
visit
from
Cavois
,
''
resumed
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
``
He
went
to
desire
you
to
come
to
the
palace
.
You
have
not
*NL*
returned
that
visit
,
and
you
were
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
I
feared
I
had
incurred
disgrace
with
your
Eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
that
be
,
monsieur
?
Could
you
incur
my
displeasure
by
having
*NL*
followed
the
orders
of
your
superiors
with
more
intelligence
and
courage
*NL*
than
another
would
have
done
?
It
is
the
people
who
do
not
obey
that
I
*NL*
punish
,
and
not
those
who
,
like
you
,
obey
--
but
too
well
.
As
a
proof
,
*NL*
remember
the
date
of
the
day
on
which
I
had
you
bidden
to
come
to
me
,
*NL*
and
seek
in
your
memory
for
what
happened
to
you
that
very
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
very
evening
when
the
abduction
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
took
*NL*
place
.
D'Artagnan
trembled
;
and
he
likewise
recollected
that
during
the
*NL*
past
half
hour
the
poor
woman
had
passed
close
to
him
,
without
doubt
*NL*
carried
away
by
the
same
power
that
had
caused
her
disappearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
''
continued
the
cardinal
,
``
as
I
have
heard
nothing
of
you
for
*NL*
some
time
past
,
I
wished
to
know
what
you
were
doing
.
Besides
,
you
owe
*NL*
me
some
thanks
.
You
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
much
you
have
been
*NL*
considered
in
all
the
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
bowed
with
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
continued
the
cardinal
,
``
arose
not
only
from
a
feeling
of
*NL*
natural
equity
,
but
likewise
from
a
plan
I
have
marked
out
with
respect
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
became
more
and
more
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
explain
this
plan
to
you
on
the
day
you
received
my
first
*NL*
invitation
;
but
you
did
not
come
.
Fortunately
,
nothing
is
lost
by
this
*NL*
delay
,
and
you
are
now
about
to
hear
it
.
Sit
down
there
,
before
me
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
;
you
are
gentleman
enough
not
to
listen
standing
.
''
And
the
*NL*
cardinal
pointed
with
his
finger
to
a
chair
for
the
young
man
,
who
was
*NL*
so
astonished
at
what
was
passing
that
he
awaited
a
second
sign
from
his
*NL*
interlocutor
before
he
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
brave
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
,
''
continued
his
Eminence
;
``
you
are
*NL*
prudent
,
which
is
still
better
.
I
like
men
of
head
and
heart

Do
n't
be
*NL*
afraid
,
''
said
he
,
smiling
.
``
By
men
of
heart
I
mean
men
of
courage

But
*NL*
young
as
you
are

scarcely
entering

the
world

you
have

powerful
enemies

if

take
great
heed

they
will
destroy
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

monseigneur

replied
the
young
man
,
``
very
easily

no

well
supported

I
am
alone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

true

done
much
already

will
do
still
more

I
do
n't
doubt

Yet
you
have
need

I
believe

to
be
*NL*
guided
in
the
adventurous
career
you
have
undertaken

for

if
I
mistake

not

you
came
to

with
the
ambitious

making
your
fortune

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
the
age

d'Artagnan

There

no

what

you
say

d'Artagnan

with
an
embarrassed

*NL*

cried
the

astonishment

D'Artagnan
colored

In
fact

placing
his

to
*NL*
ill
,
might
be
very
advantageous
to
you
.
Come
;
reflect
,
and
decide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
goodness
confounds
me
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
and
I
am
*NL*
conscious
of
a
greatness
of
soul
in
your
Eminence
that
makes
me
mean
as
*NL*
an
earthworm
;
but
since
Monseigneur
permits
me
to
speak
freely
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
I
will
presume
to
say
that
all
my
friends
are
in
the
king
's
*NL*
Musketeers
and
Guards
,
and
that
by
an
inconceivable
fatality
my
enemies
*NL*
are
in
the
service
of
your
Eminence
;
I
should
,
therefore
,
be
ill
*NL*
received
here
and
ill
regarded
there
if
I
accepted
what
Monseigneur
*NL*
offers
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
happen
to
entertain
the
haughty
idea
that
I
have
not
yet
made
*NL*
you
an
offer
equal
to
your
value
?
''
asked
the
cardinal
,
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
your
Eminence
is
a
hundred
times
too
kind
to
me
;
and
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
I
think
I
have
not
proved
myself
worthy
of
your
goodness
.
*NL*
The
siege
of
La
Rochelle
is
about
to
be
resumed
,
monseigneur
.
I
shall
*NL*
serve
under
the
eye
of
your
Eminence
,
and
if
I
have
the
good
fortune
to
*NL*
conduct
myself
at
the
siege
in
such
a
manner
as
merits
your
attention
,
*NL*
then
I
shall
at
least
leave
behind
me
some
brilliant
action
to
justify
*NL*
the
protection
with
which
you
honor
me
.
Everything
is
best
in
its
time
,
*NL*
monseigneur
.
Hereafter
,
perhaps
,
I
shall
have
the
right
of
giving
*NL*
myself
;
at
present
I
shall
appear
to
sell
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
you
refuse
to
serve
me
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
*NL*
with
a
tone
of
vexation
,
through
which
,
however
,
might
be
seen
a
sort
of
*NL*
esteem
;
``
remain
free
,
then
,
and
guard
your
hatreds
and
your
sympathies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
I
do
n't
wish
you
any
ill
;
but
you
must
*NL*
be
aware
that
it
is
quite
trouble
enough
to
defend
and
recompense
our
*NL*
friends
.
We
owe
nothing
to
our
enemies
;
and
let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
*NL*
advice
;
take
care
of
yourself
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
,
for
from
the
moment
*NL*
I
withdraw
my
hand
from
behind
you
,
I
would
not
give
an
obolus
for
your
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
do
so
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
the
Gascon
,
with
a
noble
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
at
a
later
period
and
at
a
certain
moment
,
if
any
mischance
*NL*
should
happen
to
you
,
''
said
Richelieu
,
significantly
,
``
that
it
was
I
who
*NL*
came
to
seek
you
,
and
that
I
did
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
this
*NL*
misfortune
befalling
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
entertain
,
whatever
may
happen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
placing
his
*NL*
hand
upon
his
breast
and
bowing
,
``
an
eternal
gratitude
toward
your
*NL*
Eminence
for
that
which
you
now
do
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
it
be
,
then
,
as
you
have
said
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
;
we
shall
*NL*
see
each
other
again
after
the
campaign
.
I
will
have
my
eye
upon
you
,
*NL*
for
I
shall
be
there
,
''
replied
the
cardinal
,
pointing
with
his
finger
to
*NL*
a
magnificent
suit
of
armor
he
was
to
wear
,
``
and
on
our
return
,
well
--
we
*NL*
will
settle
our
account
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
''
said
Richelieu
,
``
if
I
shall
be
able
to
say
to
you
at
*NL*
another
time
what
I
have
said
to
you
today
,
I
promise
you
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
expression
of
Richelieu
's
conveyed
a
terrible
doubt
;
it
*NL*
alarmed
d'Artagnan
more
than
a
menace
would
have
done
,
for
it
was
a
*NL*
warning
.
The
cardinal
,
then
,
was
seeking
to
preserve
him
from
some
*NL*
misfortune
which
threatened
him
.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
,
but
with
*NL*
a
haughty
gesture
the
cardinal
dismissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
went
out
,
but
at
the
door
his
heart
almost
failed
him
,
and
he
*NL*
felt
inclined
to
return
.
Then
the
noble
and
severe
countenance
of
Athos
*NL*
crossed
his
mind
;
if
he
made
the
compact
with
the
cardinal
which
he
*NL*
required
,
Athos
would
no
more
give
him
his
hand
--
Athos
would
renounce
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
fear
that
restrained
him
,
so
powerful
is
the
influence
of
a
*NL*
truly
great
character
on
all
that
surrounds
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
descended
by
the
staircase
at
which
he
had
entered
,
and
found
*NL*
Athos
and
the
four
Musketeers
waiting
his
appearance
,
and
beginning
to
*NL*
grow
uneasy
.
With
a
word
,
d'Artagnan
reassured
them
;
and
Planchet
ran
to
*NL*
inform
the
other
sentinels
that
it
was
useless
to
keep
guard
longer
,
as
*NL*
his
master
had
come
out
safe
from
the
Palais-Cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Returned
home
with
Athos
,
Aramis
and
Porthos
inquired
eagerly
the
cause
*NL*
of
the
strange
interview
;
but
d'Artagnan
confined
himself
to
telling
*NL*
them
that
M.
de
Richelieu
had
sent
for
him
to
propose
to
him
to
enter
*NL*
into
his
guards
with
the
rank
of
ensign
,
and
that
he
had
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
were
right
,
''
cried
Aramis
and
Porthos
,
with
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
and
answered
nothing
.
But
when
they
*NL*
were
alone
he
said
,
``
You
have
done
that
which
you
ought
to
have
done
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
;
but
perhaps
you
have
been
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
sighed
deeply
,
for
this
voice
responded
to
a
secret
voice
of
*NL*
his
soul
,
which
told
him
that
great
misfortunes
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
the
next
day
was
spent
in
preparations
for
departure
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
went
to
take
leave
of
M.
de
Treville
.
At
that
time
it
was
*NL*
believed
that
the
separation
of
the
Musketeers
and
the
Guards
would
be
*NL*
but
momentary
,
the
king
holding
his
Parliament
that
very
day
and
*NL*
proposing
to
set
out
the
day
after
.
M.
de
Treville
contented
himself
*NL*
with
asking
d'Artagnan
if
he
could
do
anything
for
him
,
but
d'Artagnan
*NL*
answered
that
he
was
supplied
with
all
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
brought
together
all
those
comrades
of
the
Guards
of
M.
*NL*
Dessessart
and
the
company
of
Musketeers
of
M.
de
Treville
who
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
associate
together
.
They
were
parting
to
meet
again
when
*NL*
it
pleased
God
,
and
if
it
pleased
God
.
That
night
,
then
,
was
somewhat
*NL*
riotous
,
as
may
be
imagined
.
In
such
cases
extreme
preoccupation
is
only
*NL*
to
be
combated
by
extreme
carelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
sound
of
the
morning
trumpet
the
friends
separated
;
the
*NL*
Musketeers
hastening
to
the
hotel
of
M.
de
Treville
,
the
Guards
to
that
*NL*
of
M.
Dessessart
.
Each
of
the
captains
then
led
his
company
to
the
*NL*
Louvre
,
where
the
king
held
his
review
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
was
dull
and
appeared
ill
,
which
detracted
a
little
from
his
*NL*
usual
lofty
bearing
.
In
fact
,
the
evening
before
,
a
fever
had
seized
him
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
the
Parliament
,
while
he
was
holding
his
Bed
of
Justice
.
*NL*
He
had
,
not
the
less
,
decided
upon
setting
out
that
same
evening
;
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
remonstrances
that
had
been
offered
to
him
,
he
persisted
in
*NL*
having
the
review
,
hoping
by
setting
it
at
defiance
to
conquer
the
*NL*
disease
which
began
to
lay
hold
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
review
over
,
the
Guards
set
forward
alone
on
their
march
,
the
*NL*
Musketeers
waiting
for
the
king
,
which
allowed
Porthos
time
to
go
and
*NL*
take
a
turn
in
his
superb
equipment
in
the
Rue
aux
Ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procurator
's
wife
saw
him
pass
in
his
new
uniform
and
on
his
fine
*NL*
horse
.
She
loved
Porthos
too
dearly
to
allow
him
to
part
thus
;
she
made
*NL*
him
a
sign
to
dismount
and
come
to
her
.
Porthos
was
magnificent
;
his
*NL*
spurs
jingled
,
his
cuirass
glittered
,
his
sword
knocked
proudly
against
*NL*
his
ample
limbs
.
This
time
the
clerks
evinced
no
inclination
to
laugh
,
*NL*
such
a
real
ear
clipper
did
Porthos
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Musketeer
was
introduced
to
M.
Coquenard
,
whose
little
gray
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
with
anger
at
seeing
his
cousin
all
blazing
new
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
one
thing
afforded
him
inward
consolation
;
it
was
expected
by
everybody
*NL*
that
the
campaign
would
be
a
severe
one
.
He
whispered
a
hope
to
himself
*NL*
that
this
beloved
relative
might
be
killed
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
paid
his
compliments
to
M.
Coquenard
and
bade
him
farewell
.
M.
*NL*
Coquenard
wished
him
all
sorts
of
prosperities
.
As
to
Mme.
Coquenard
,
*NL*
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
;
but
no
evil
impressions
were
taken
*NL*
from
her
grief
as
she
was
known
to
be
very
much
attached
to
her
*NL*
relatives
,
about
whom
she
was
constantly
having
serious
disputes
with
*NL*
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
real
adieux
were
made
in
Mme.
Coquenard
's
chamber
;
they
were
*NL*
heartrending
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
the
procurator
's
wife
could
follow
him
with
her
eyes
,
she
*NL*
waved
her
handkerchief
to
him
,
leaning
so
far
out
of
the
window
as
to
*NL*
lead
people
to
believe
she
wished
to
precipitate
herself
.
Porthos
*NL*
received
all
these
attentions
like
a
man
accustomed
to
such
*NL*
demonstrations
,
only
on
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
he
lifted
his
*NL*
hat
gracefully
,
and
waved
it
to
her
as
a
sign
of
adieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
part
Aramis
wrote
a
long
letter
.
To
whom
?
Nobody
knew
.
Kitty
,
who
*NL*
was
to
set
out
that
evening
for
Tours
,
was
waiting
in
the
next
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
sipped
the
last
bottle
of
his
Spanish
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
d'Artagnan
was
defiling
with
his
company
.
Arriving
at
*NL*
the
Faubourg
St.
Antoine
,
he
turned
round
to
look
gaily
at
the
Bastille
;
*NL*
but
as
it
was
the
Bastille
alone
he
looked
at
,
he
did
not
observe
*NL*
Milady
,
who
,
mounted
upon
a
light
chestnut
horse
,
designated
him
with
*NL*
her
finger
to
two
ill-looking
men
who
came
close
up
to
the
ranks
to
take
*NL*
notice
of
him
.
To
a
look
of
interrogation
which
they
made
,
Milady
*NL*
replied
by
a
sign
that
it
was
he
.
Then
,
certain
that
there
could
be
no
*NL*
mistake
in
the
execution
of
her
orders
,
she
started
her
horse
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
followed
the
company
,
and
on
leaving
the
Faubourg
St.
*NL*
Antoine
,
mounted
two
horses
properly
equipped
,
which
a
servant
without
*NL*
livery
had
waiting
for
them
.

THE
SEIGE
OF
LA
ROCHELLE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Siege
of
La
Rochelle
was
one
of
the
great
political
events
of
the
*NL*
reign
of
Louis
XIII
,
and
one
of
the
great
military
enterprises
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
.
It
is
,
then
,
interesting
and
even
necessary
that
we
should
say
*NL*
a
few
words
about
it
,
particularly
as
many
details
of
this
siege
are
*NL*
connected
in
too
important
a
manner
with
the
story
we
have
undertaken
to
*NL*
relate
to
allow
us
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
political
plans
of
the
cardinal
when
he
undertook
this
siege
were
*NL*
extensive
.
Let
us
unfold
them
first
,
and
then
pass
on
to
the
private
*NL*
plans
which
perhaps
had
not
less
influence
upon
his
Eminence
than
the
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
important
cities
given
up
by
Henry
IV
to
the
Huguenots
as
places
*NL*
of
safety
,
there
only
remained
La
Rochelle
.
It
became
necessary
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
destroy
this
last
bulwark
of
Calvinism
--
a
dangerous
leaven
*NL*
with
which
the
ferments
of
civil
revolt
and
foreign
war
were
constantly
*NL*
mingling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spaniards
,
Englishmen
,
and
Italian
malcontents
,
adventurers
of
all
*NL*
nations
,
and
soldiers
of
fortune
of
every
sect
,
flocked
at
the
first
*NL*
summons
under
the
standard
of
the
Protestants
,
and
organized
themselves
*NL*
like
a
vast
association
,
whose
branches
diverged
freely
over
all
parts
*NL*
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Rochelle
,
which
had
derived
a
new
importance
from
the
ruin
of
the
*NL*
other
Calvinist
cities
,
was
,
then
,
the
focus
of
dissensions
and
*NL*
ambition
.
Moreover
,
its
port
was
the
last
in
the
kingdom
of
France
open
*NL*
to
the
English
,
and
by
closing
it
against
England
,
our
eternal
enemy
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
completed
the
work
of
Joan
of
Arc
and
the
Duc
de
Guise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Bassompierre
,
who
was
at
once
Protestant
and
Catholic
--
Protestant
*NL*
by
conviction
and
Catholic
as
commander
of
the
order
of
the
Holy
Ghost
;
*NL*
Bassompierre
,
who
was
a
German
by
birth
and
a
Frenchman
at
heart
--
in
*NL*
short
,
Bassompierre
,
who
had
a
distinguished
command
at
the
siege
of
La
*NL*
Rochelle
,
said
,
in
charging
at
the
head
of
several
other
Protestant
*NL*
nobles
like
himself
,
``
You
will
see
,
gentlemen
,
that
we
shall
be
fools
*NL*
enough
to
take
La
Rochelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Bassompierre
was
right
.
The
cannonade
of
the
Isle
of
Re
presaged
to
*NL*
him
the
dragonnades
of
the
Cevennes
;
the
taking
of
La
Rochelle
was
the
*NL*
preface
to
the
revocation
of
the
Edict
of
Nantes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
hinted
that
by
the
side
of
these
views
of
the
leveling
and
*NL*
simplifying
minister
,
which
belong
to
history
,
the
chronicler
is
forced
*NL*
to
recognize
the
lesser
motives
of
the
amorous
man
and
jealous
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
,
as
everyone
knows
,
had
loved
the
queen
.
Was
this
love
a
*NL*
simple
political
affair
,
or
was
it
naturally
one
of
those
profound
*NL*
passions
which
Anne
of
Austria
inspired
in
those
who
approached
her
?
*NL*
That
we
are
not
able
to
say
;
but
at
all
events
,
we
have
seen
,
by
the
*NL*
anterior
developments
of
this
story
,
that
Buckingham
had
the
advantage
*NL*
over
him
,
and
in
two
or
three
circumstances
,
particularly
that
of
the
*NL*
diamond
studs
,
had
,
thanks
to
the
devotedness
of
the
three
Musketeers
*NL*
and
the
courage
and
conduct
of
d'Artagnan
,
cruelly
mystified
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
then
,
Richelieu
's
object
,
not
only
to
get
rid
of
an
enemy
of
*NL*
France
,
but
to
avenge
himself
on
a
rival
;
but
this
vengeance
must
be
*NL*
grand
and
striking
and
worthy
in
every
way
of
a
man
who
held
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
as
his
weapon
for
combat
,
the
forces
of
a
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
knew
that
in
combating
England
he
combated
Buckingham
;
that
in
*NL*
triumphing
over
England
he
triumphed
over
Buckingham
--
in
short
,
that
in
*NL*
humiliating
England
in
the
eyes
of
Europe
he
humiliated
Buckingham
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
side
Buckingham
,
in
pretending
to
maintain
the
honor
of
England
,
*NL*
was
moved
by
interests
exactly
like
those
of
the
cardinal
.
Buckingham
*NL*
also
was
pursuing
a
private
vengeance
.
Buckingham
could
not
under
any
*NL*
pretense
be
admitted
into
France
as
an
ambassador
;
he
wished
to
enter
it
*NL*
as
a
conqueror
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
resulted
from
this
that
the
real
stake
in
this
game
,
which
two
most
*NL*
powerful
kingdoms
played
for
the
good
pleasure
of
two
amorous
men
,
was
*NL*
simply
a
kind
look
from
Anne
of
Austria
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
advantage
had
been
gained
by
Buckingham
.
Arriving
unexpectedly
*NL*
in
sight
of
the
Isle
of
Re
with
ninety
vessels
and
nearly
twenty
*NL*
thousand
men
,
he
had
surprised
the
Comte
de
Toiras
,
who
commanded
for
*NL*
the
king
in
the
Isle
,
and
he
had
,
after
a
bloody
conflict
,
effected
his
*NL*
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allow
us
to
observe
in
passing
that
in
this
fight
perished
the
Baron
de
*NL*
Chantal
;
that
the
Baron
de
Chantal
left
a
little
orphan
girl
eighteen
*NL*
months
old
,
and
that
this
little
girl
was
afterward
Mme.
de
Sevigne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Comte
de
Toiras
retired
into
the
citadel
St.
Martin
with
his
*NL*
garrison
,
and
threw
a
hundred
men
into
a
little
fort
called
the
fort
of
*NL*
La
Pree
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
event
had
hastened
the
resolutions
of
the
cardinal
;
and
till
the
*NL*
king
and
he
could
take
the
command
of
the
siege
of
La
Rochelle
,
which
*NL*
was
determined
,
he
had
sent
Monsieur
to
direct
the
first
operations
,
and
*NL*
had
ordered
all
the
troops
he
could
dispose
of
to
march
toward
the
*NL*
theater
of
war
.
It
was
of
this
detachment
,
sent
as
a
vanguard
,
that
our
*NL*
friend
d'Artagnan
formed
a
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
to
follow
as
soon
as
his
Bed
of
Justice
*NL*
had
been
held
;
but
on
rising
from
his
Bed
of
Justice
on
the
*NL*
twenty-eighth
of
June
,
he
felt
himself
attacked
by
fever
.
He
was
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
,
anxious
to
set
out
;
but
his
illness
becoming
more
*NL*
serious
,
he
was
forced
to
stop
at
Villeroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
whenever
the
king
halted
,
the
Musketeers
halted
.
It
followed
that
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
was
as
yet
purely
and
simply
in
the
Guards
,
found
*NL*
himself
,
for
the
time
at
least
,
separated
from
his
good
friends
--
Athos
,
*NL*
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
.
This
separation
,
which
was
no
more
than
an
*NL*
unpleasant
circumstance
,
would
have
certainly
become
a
cause
of
serious
*NL*
uneasiness
if
he
had
been
able
to
guess
by
what
unknown
dangers
he
was
*NL*
surrounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
however
,
arrived
without
accident
in
the
camp
established
before
La
*NL*
Rochelle
,
on
the
tenth
of
the
month
of
September
of
the
year
1627
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
in
the
same
state
.
The
Duke
of
Buckingham
and
his
*NL*
English
,
masters
of
the
Isle
of
Re
,
continued
to
besiege
,
but
without
*NL*
success
,
the
citadel
St.
Martin
and
the
fort
of
La
Pree
;
and
hostilities
*NL*
with
La
Rochelle
had
commenced
,
two
or
three
days
before
,
about
a
fort
*NL*
which
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
had
caused
to
be
constructed
near
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Guards
,
under
the
command
of
M.
Dessessart
,
took
up
their
quarters
*NL*
at
the
Minimes
;
but
,
as
we
know
,
d'Artagnan
,
possessed
with
ambition
to
*NL*
enter
the
Musketeers
,
had
formed
but
few
friendships
among
his
comrades
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
himself
isolated
and
given
up
to
his
own
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
reflections
were
not
very
cheerful
.
From
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
*NL*
Paris
,
he
had
been
mixed
up
with
public
affairs
;
but
his
own
private
*NL*
affairs
had
made
no
great
progress
,
either
in
love
or
fortune
.
As
to
*NL*
love
,
the
only
woman
he
could
have
loved
was
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
and
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
had
disappeared
,
without
his
being
able
to
discover
what
had
*NL*
become
of
her
.
As
to
fortune
,
he
had
made
--
he
,
humble
as
he
was
--
an
*NL*
enemy
of
the
cardinal
;
that
is
to
say
,
of
a
man
before
whom
trembled
the
*NL*
greatest
men
of
the
kingdom
,
beginning
with
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
man
had
the
power
to
crush
him
,
and
yet
he
had
not
done
so
.
For
a
*NL*
mind
so
perspicuous
as
that
of
d'Artagnan
,
this
indulgence
was
a
light
*NL*
by
which
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
better
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
had
made
himself
another
enemy
,
less
to
be
feared
,
he
thought
;
*NL*
but
nevertheless
,
he
instinctively
felt
,
not
to
be
despised
.
This
enemy
*NL*
was
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
exchange
for
all
this
,
he
had
acquired
the
protection
and
good
will
*NL*
of
the
queen
;
but
the
favor
of
the
queen
was
at
the
present
time
an
*NL*
additional
cause
of
persecution
,
and
her
protection
,
as
it
was
known
,
*NL*
protected
badly
--
as
witness
Chalais
and
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
had
clearly
gained
in
all
this
was
the
diamond
,
worth
five
or
*NL*
six
thousand
livres
,
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
;
and
even
this
*NL*
diamond
--
supposing
that
d'Artagnan
,
in
his
projects
of
ambition
,
wished
*NL*
to
keep
it
,
to
make
it
someday
a
pledge
for
the
gratitude
of
the
*NL*
queen
--
had
not
in
the
meanwhile
,
since
he
could
not
part
with
it
,
more
*NL*
value
than
the
gravel
he
trod
under
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
say
the
gravel
he
trod
under
his
feet
,
for
d'Artagnan
made
these
*NL*
reflections
while
walking
solitarily
along
a
pretty
little
road
which
*NL*
led
from
the
camp
to
the
village
of
Angoutin
.
Now
,
these
reflections
had
*NL*
led
him
further
than
he
intended
,
and
the
day
was
beginning
to
decline
*NL*
when
,
by
the
last
ray
of
the
setting
sun
,
he
thought
he
saw
the
barrel
*NL*
of
a
musket
glitter
from
behind
a
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
a
quick
eye
and
a
prompt
understanding
.
He
comprehended
*NL*
that
the
musket
had
not
come
there
of
itself
,
and
that
he
who
bore
it
*NL*
had
not
concealed
himself
behind
a
hedge
with
any
friendly
intentions
.
*NL*
He
determined
,
therefore
,
to
direct
his
course
as
clear
from
it
as
he
*NL*
could
when
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
,
from
behind
a
rock
,
he
*NL*
perceived
the
extremity
of
another
musket
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
evidently
an
ambuscade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
cast
a
glance
at
the
first
musket
and
saw
,
with
a
certain
*NL*
degree
of
inquietude
,
that
it
was
leveled
in
his
direction
;
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
perceived
that
the
orifice
of
the
barrel
was
motionless
,
he
threw
*NL*
himself
upon
the
ground
.
At
the
same
instant
the
gun
was
fired
,
and
he
*NL*
heard
the
whistling
of
a
ball
pass
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
time
was
to
be
lost
.
D'Artagnan
sprang
up
with
a
bound
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
instant
the
ball
from
the
other
musket
tore
up
the
gravel
on
the
*NL*
very
spot
on
the
road
where
he
had
thrown
himself
with
his
face
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
not
one
of
those
foolhardy
men
who
seek
a
ridiculous
*NL*
death
in
order
that
it
may
be
said
of
them
that
they
did
not
retreat
a
*NL*
single
step
.
Besides
,
courage
was
out
of
the
question
here
;
d'Artagnan
*NL*
had
fallen
into
an
ambush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
a
third
shot
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
I
am
a
lost
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
,
therefore
,
took
to
his
heels
and
ran
toward
the
camp
,
*NL*
with
the
swiftness
of
the
young
men
of
his
country
,
so
renowned
for
*NL*
their
agility
;
but
whatever
might
be
his
speed
,
the
first
who
fired
,
*NL*
having
had
time
to
reload
,
fired
a
second
shot
,
and
this
time
so
well
*NL*
aimed
that
it
struck
his
hat
,
and
carried
it
ten
paces
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
,
however
,
had
no
other
hat
,
he
picked
up
this
as
he
ran
,
and
*NL*
arrived
at
his
quarters
very
pale
and
quite
out
of
breath
.
He
sat
down
*NL*
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
,
and
began
to
reflect
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
event
might
have
three
causes
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
and
the
most
natural
was
that
it
might
be
an
ambuscade
of
the
*NL*
Rochellais
,
who
might
not
be
sorry
to
kill
one
of
his
Majesty
's
Guards
,
*NL*
because
it
would
be
an
enemy
the
less
,
and
this
enemy
might
have
a
*NL*
well-furnished
purse
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
his
hat
,
examined
the
hole
made
by
the
ball
,
and
shook
*NL*
his
head
.
The
ball
was
not
a
musket
ball
--
it
was
an
arquebus
ball
.
The
*NL*
accuracy
of
the
aim
had
first
given
him
the
idea
that
a
special
weapon
*NL*
had
been
employed
.
This
could
not
,
then
,
be
a
military
ambuscade
,
as
the
*NL*
ball
was
not
of
the
regular
caliber
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
might
be
a
kind
remembrance
of
Monsieur
the
Cardinal
.
It
may
be
*NL*
observed
that
at
the
very
moment
when
,
thanks
to
the
ray
of
the
sun
,
he
*NL*
perceived
the
gun
barrel
,
he
was
thinking
with
astonishment
on
the
*NL*
forbearance
of
his
Eminence
with
respect
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
again
shook
his
head
.
For
people
toward
whom
he
had
but
*NL*
to
put
forth
his
hand
,
his
Eminence
had
rarely
recourse
to
such
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
a
vengeance
of
Milady
;
that
was
most
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
in
vain
to
remember
the
faces
or
dress
of
the
assassins
;
he
had
*NL*
escaped
so
rapidly
that
he
had
not
had
leisure
to
notice
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
poor
friends
!
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
;
``
where
are
you
?
And
that
you
*NL*
should
fail
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
passed
a
very
bad
night
.
Three
or
four
times
he
started
up
,
*NL*
imagining
that
a
man
was
approaching
his
bed
for
the
purpose
of
stabbing
*NL*
him
.
Nevertheless
,
day
dawned
without
darkness
having
brought
any
*NL*
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
d'Artagnan
well
suspected
that
that
which
was
deferred
was
not
*NL*
relinquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
all
day
in
his
quarters
,
assigning
as
a
reason
to
*NL*
himself
that
the
weather
was
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
the
next
morning
,
the
drums
beat
to
arms
.
The
Duc
*NL*
d'Orleans
visited
the
posts
.
The
guards
were
under
arms
,
and
d'Artagnan
*NL*
took
his
place
in
the
midst
of
his
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
passed
along
the
front
of
the
line
;
then
all
the
superior
*NL*
officers
approached
him
to
pay
their
compliments
,
M.
Dessessart
,
captain
*NL*
of
the
Guards
,
as
well
as
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
minute
or
two
,
it
appeared
to
d'Artagnan
that
M.
*NL*
Dessessart
made
him
a
sign
to
approach
.
He
waited
for
a
fresh
gesture
on
*NL*
the
part
of
his
superior
,
for
fear
he
might
be
mistaken
;
but
this
*NL*
gesture
being
repeated
,
he
left
the
ranks
,
and
advanced
to
receive
*NL*
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
is
about
to
ask
for
some
men
of
good
will
for
a
dangerous
*NL*
mission
,
but
one
which
will
do
honor
to
those
who
shall
accomplish
it
;
*NL*
and
I
made
you
a
sign
in
order
that
you
might
hold
yourself
in
*NL*
readiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
my
captain
!
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
who
wished
for
nothing
better
*NL*
than
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
under
the
eye
of
the
*NL*
lieutenant
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
the
Rochellais
had
made
a
sortie
during
the
night
,
and
had
*NL*
retaken
a
bastion
of
which
the
royal
army
had
gained
possession
two
days
*NL*
before
.
The
matter
was
to
ascertain
,
by
reconnoitering
,
how
the
enemy
*NL*
guarded
this
bastion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
Monsieur
raised
his
voice
,
and
said
,
``
I
want
*NL*
for
this
mission
three
or
four
volunteers
,
led
by
a
man
who
can
be
*NL*
depended
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
man
to
be
depended
upon
,
I
have
him
under
my
hand
,
monsieur
,
''
*NL*
said
M.
Dessessart
,
pointing
to
d'Artagnan
;
``
and
as
to
the
four
or
five
*NL*
volunteers
,
Monsieur
has
but
to
make
his
intentions
known
,
and
the
men
*NL*
will
not
be
wanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
men
of
good
will
who
will
risk
being
killed
with
me
!
''
said
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
raising
his
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
his
comrades
of
the
Guards
immediately
sprang
forward
,
and
two
*NL*
other
soldiers
having
joined
them
,
the
number
was
deemed
sufficient
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
declined
all
others
,
being
unwilling
to
take
the
first
chance
*NL*
from
those
who
had
the
priority
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
known
whether
,
after
the
taking
of
the
bastion
,
the
*NL*
Rochellais
had
evacuated
it
or
left
a
garrison
in
it
;
the
object
then
*NL*
was
to
examine
the
place
near
enough
to
verify
the
reports
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
set
out
with
his
four
companions
,
and
followed
the
trench
;
*NL*
the
two
Guards
marched
abreast
with
him
,
and
the
two
soldiers
followed
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
thus
,
screened
by
the
lining
of
the
trench
,
till
they
came
*NL*
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
bastion
.
There
,
on
turning
round
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
perceived
that
the
two
soldiers
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
,
beginning
to
be
afraid
,
they
had
stayed
behind
,
and
he
*NL*
continued
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
turning
of
the
counterscarp
they
found
themselves
within
about
*NL*
sixty
paces
of
the
bastion
.
They
saw
no
one
,
and
the
bastion
seemed
*NL*
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
composing
our
forlorn
hope
were
deliberating
whether
they
*NL*
should
proceed
any
further
,
when
all
at
once
a
circle
of
smoke
enveloped
*NL*
the
giant
of
stone
,
and
a
dozen
balls
came
whistling
around
d'Artagnan
*NL*
and
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
all
they
wished
to
know
;
the
bastion
was
guarded
.
A
longer
*NL*
stay
in
this
dangerous
spot
would
have
been
useless
imprudence
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
his
two
companions
turned
their
backs
,
and
commenced
a
*NL*
retreat
which
resembled
a
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
angle
of
the
trench
which
was
to
serve
them
as
a
*NL*
rampart
,
one
of
the
Guardsmen
fell
.
A
ball
had
passed
through
his
*NL*
breast
.
The
other
,
who
was
safe
and
sound
,
continued
his
way
toward
the
*NL*
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
not
willing
to
abandon
his
companion
thus
,
and
stooped
to
*NL*
raise
him
and
assist
him
in
regaining
the
lines
;
but
at
this
moment
two
*NL*
shots
were
fired
.
One
ball
struck
the
head
of
the
already-wounded
guard
,
*NL*
and
the
other
flattened
itself
against
a
rock
,
after
having
passed
*NL*
within
two
inches
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
turned
quickly
round
,
for
this
attack
could
not
have
come
*NL*
from
the
bastion
,
which
was
hidden
by
the
angle
of
the
trench
.
The
idea
*NL*
of
the
two
soldiers
who
had
abandoned
him
occurred
to
his
mind
,
and
with
*NL*
them
he
remembered
the
assassins
of
two
evenings
before
.
He
resolved
*NL*
this
time
to
know
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
,
and
fell
upon
the
body
of
*NL*
his
comrade
as
if
he
were
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quickly
saw
two
heads
appear
above
an
abandoned
work
within
thirty
*NL*
paces
of
him
;
they
were
the
heads
of
the
two
soldiers
.
D'Artagnan
had
*NL*
not
been
deceived
;
these
two
men
had
only
followed
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
assassinating
him
,
hoping
that
the
young
man
's
death
would
be
placed
to
*NL*
the
account
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
might
be
only
wounded
and
might
denounce
their
crime
,
they
came
up
*NL*
to
him
with
the
purpose
of
making
sure
.
Fortunately
,
deceived
by
*NL*
d'Artagnan
's
trick
,
they
neglected
to
reload
their
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
within
ten
paces
of
him
,
d'Artagnan
,
who
in
falling
had
*NL*
taken
care
not
to
let
go
his
sword
,
sprang
up
close
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assassins
comprehended
that
if
they
fled
toward
the
camp
without
*NL*
having
killed
their
man
,
they
should
be
accused
by
him
;
therefore
their
*NL*
first
idea
was
to
join
the
enemy
.
One
of
them
took
his
gun
by
the
*NL*
barrel
,
and
used
it
as
he
would
a
club
.
He
aimed
a
terrible
blow
at
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
who
avoided
it
by
springing
to
one
side
;
but
by
this
*NL*
movement
he
left
a
passage
free
to
the
bandit
,
who
darted
off
toward
the
*NL*
bastion
.
As
the
Rochellais
who
guarded
the
bastion
were
ignorant
of
the
*NL*
intentions
of
the
man
they
saw
coming
toward
them
,
they
fired
upon
him
,
*NL*
and
he
fell
,
struck
by
a
ball
which
broke
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
d'Artagnan
had
thrown
himself
upon
the
other
soldier
,
attacking
*NL*
him
with
his
sword
.
The
conflict
was
not
long
;
the
wretch
had
nothing
to
*NL*
defend
himself
with
but
his
discharged
arquebus
.
The
sword
of
the
*NL*
Guardsman
slipped
along
the
barrel
of
the
now-useless
weapon
,
and
passed
*NL*
through
the
thigh
of
the
assassin
,
who
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
immediately
placed
the
point
of
his
sword
at
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
not
kill
me
!
''
cried
the
bandit
.
``
Pardon
,
pardon
,
my
officer
,
and
*NL*
I
will
tell
you
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
secret
of
enough
importance
to
me
to
spare
your
life
for
it
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
young
man
,
withholding
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
if
you
think
existence
worth
anything
to
a
man
of
twenty
,
as
you
*NL*
are
,
and
who
may
hope
for
everything
,
being
handsome
and
brave
,
as
you
*NL*
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretch
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
speak
quickly
!
Who
employed
you
to
*NL*
assassinate
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
whom
I
do
n't
know
,
but
who
is
called
Milady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
do
n't
know
this
woman
,
how
do
you
know
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
comrade
knows
her
,
and
called
her
so
.
It
was
with
him
she
agreed
,
*NL*
and
not
with
me
;
he
even
has
in
his
pocket
a
letter
from
that
person
,
*NL*
who
attaches
great
importance
to
you
,
as
I
have
heard
him
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
you
become
concerned
in
this
villainous
affair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
proposed
to
me
to
undertake
it
with
him
,
and
I
agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
did
she
give
you
for
this
fine
enterprise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
louis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
!
''
said
the
young
man
,
laughing
,
``
she
thinks
I
am
worth
*NL*
something
.
A
hundred
louis
?
Well
,
that
was
a
temptation
for
two
wretches
*NL*
like
you
.
I
understand
why
you
accepted
it
,
and
I
grant
you
my
pardon
;
*NL*
but
upon
one
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
said
the
soldier
,
uneasy
at
perceiving
that
all
was
not
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
will
go
and
fetch
me
the
letter
your
comrade
has
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
the
bandit
,
``
that
is
only
another
way
of
killing
me
.
How
*NL*
can
I
go
and
fetch
that
letter
under
the
fire
of
the
bastion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
nevertheless
make
up
your
mind
to
go
and
get
it
,
or
I
swear
*NL*
you
shall
die
by
my
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
monsieur
;
pity
!
In
the
name
of
that
young
lady
you
love
,
and
*NL*
whom
you
perhaps
believe
dead
but
who
is
not
!
''
cried
the
bandit
,
*NL*
throwing
himself
upon
his
knees
and
leaning
upon
his
hand
--
for
he
began
*NL*
to
lose
his
strength
with
his
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
do
you
know
there
is
a
young
woman
whom
I
love
,
and
that
I
*NL*
believed
that
woman
dead
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
that
letter
which
my
comrade
has
in
his
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
then
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
that
I
must
have
that
letter
.
So
no
*NL*
more
delay
,
no
more
hesitation
;
or
else
whatever
may
be
my
repugnance
to
*NL*
soiling
my
sword
a
second
time
with
the
blood
of
a
wretch
like
you
,
I
*NL*
swear
by
my
faith
as
an
honest
man
--
''
and
at
these
words
d'Artagnan
made
*NL*
so
fierce
a
gesture
that
the
wounded
man
sprang
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
stop
!
''
cried
he
,
regaining
strength
by
force
of
terror
.
``
I
will
*NL*
go
--
I
will
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
the
soldier
's
arquebus
,
made
him
go
on
before
him
,
and
*NL*
urged
him
toward
his
companion
by
pricking
him
behind
with
his
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
frightful
thing
to
see
this
wretch
,
leaving
a
long
track
of
*NL*
blood
on
the
ground
he
passed
over
,
pale
with
approaching
death
,
trying
*NL*
to
drag
himself
along
without
being
seen
to
the
body
of
his
accomplice
,
*NL*
which
lay
twenty
paces
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terror
was
so
strongly
painted
on
his
face
,
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
,
*NL*
that
d'Artagnan
took
pity
on
him
,
and
casting
upon
him
a
look
of
*NL*
contempt
,
``
Stop
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
show
you
the
difference
between
a
man
*NL*
of
courage
and
such
a
coward
as
you
.
Stay
where
you
are
;
I
will
go
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
light
step
,
an
eye
on
the
watch
,
observing
the
movements
of
*NL*
the
enemy
and
taking
advantage
of
the
accidents
of
the
ground
,
*NL*
d'Artagnan
succeeded
in
reaching
the
second
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
means
of
gaining
his
object
--
to
search
him
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
or
to
carry
him
away
,
making
a
buckler
of
his
body
,
and
search
him
in
*NL*
the
trench
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
preferred
the
second
means
,
and
lifted
the
assassin
onto
his
*NL*
shoulders
at
the
moment
the
enemy
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
shock
,
the
dull
noise
of
three
balls
which
penetrated
the
*NL*
flesh
,
a
last
cry
,
a
convulsion
of
agony
,
proved
to
d'Artagnan
that
the
*NL*
would-be
assassin
had
saved
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
regained
the
trench
,
and
threw
the
corpse
beside
the
wounded
*NL*
man
,
who
was
as
pale
as
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
search
.
A
leather
pocketbook
,
a
purse
,
in
which
was
*NL*
evidently
a
part
of
the
sum
which
the
bandit
had
received
,
with
a
dice
*NL*
box
and
dice
,
completed
the
possessions
of
the
dead
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
box
and
dice
where
they
fell
,
threw
the
purse
to
the
wounded
*NL*
man
,
and
eagerly
opened
the
pocketbook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
some
unimportant
papers
he
found
the
following
letter
,
that
which
*NL*
he
had
sought
at
the
risk
of
his
life
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
have
lost
sight
of
that
woman
and
she
is
now
in
safety
in
the
*NL*
convent
,
which
you
should
never
have
allowed
her
to
reach
,
try
,
at
*NL*
least
,
not
to
miss
the
man
.
If
you
do
,
you
know
that
my
hand
stretches
*NL*
far
,
and
that
you
shall
pay
very
dearly
for
the
hundred
louis
you
have
*NL*
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
signature
.
Nevertheless
it
was
plain
the
letter
came
from
Milady
.
He
*NL*
consequently
kept
it
as
a
piece
of
evidence
,
and
being
in
safety
behind
*NL*
the
angle
of
the
trench
,
he
began
to
interrogate
the
wounded
man
.
He
*NL*
confessed
that
he
had
undertaken
with
his
comrade
--
the
same
who
was
*NL*
killed
--
to
carry
off
a
young
woman
who
was
to
leave
Paris
by
the
*NL*
Barriere
de
La
Villette
;
but
having
stopped
to
drink
at
a
cabaret
,
they
*NL*
had
missed
the
carriage
by
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
were
you
to
do
with
that
woman
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
,
with
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
to
have
conveyed
her
to
a
hotel
in
the
Place
Royale
,
''
said
the
*NL*
wounded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
murmured
d'Artagnan
;
``
that
's
the
place
--
Milady
's
own
*NL*
residence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
young
man
tremblingly
comprehended
what
a
terrible
thirst
for
*NL*
vengeance
urged
this
woman
on
to
destroy
him
,
as
well
as
all
who
loved
*NL*
him
,
and
how
well
she
must
be
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
court
,
*NL*
since
she
had
discovered
all
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
she
owed
this
*NL*
information
to
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
amid
all
this
he
perceived
,
with
a
feeling
of
real
joy
,
that
the
*NL*
queen
must
have
discovered
the
prison
in
which
poor
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
*NL*
explaining
her
devotion
,
and
that
she
had
freed
her
from
that
prison
;
*NL*
and
the
letter
he
had
received
from
the
young
woman
,
and
her
passage
*NL*
along
the
road
of
Chaillot
like
an
apparition
,
were
now
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
also
,
as
Athos
had
predicted
,
it
became
possible
to
find
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
and
a
convent
was
not
impregnable
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
completely
restored
clemency
to
his
heart
.
He
turned
toward
*NL*
the
wounded
man
,
who
had
watched
with
intense
anxiety
all
the
various
*NL*
expressions
of
his
countenance
,
and
holding
out
his
arm
to
him
,
said
,
*NL*
``
Come
,
I
will
not
abandon
you
thus
.
Lean
upon
me
,
and
let
us
return
to
*NL*
the
camp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
who
could
scarcely
believe
in
such
magnanimity
,
*NL*
``
but
is
it
not
to
have
me
hanged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
my
word
,
''
said
he
;
``
for
the
second
time
I
give
you
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wounded
man
sank
upon
his
knees
,
to
again
kiss
the
feet
of
his
*NL*
preserver
;
but
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
no
longer
a
motive
for
staying
so
*NL*
near
the
enemy
,
abridged
the
testimonials
of
his
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Guardsman
who
had
returned
at
the
first
discharge
announced
the
*NL*
death
of
his
four
companions
.
They
were
therefore
much
astonished
and
*NL*
delighted
in
the
regiment
when
they
saw
the
young
man
come
back
safe
and
*NL*
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
explained
the
sword
wound
of
his
companion
by
a
sortie
which
*NL*
he
improvised
.
He
described
the
death
of
the
other
soldier
,
and
the
*NL*
perils
they
had
encountered
.
This
recital
was
for
him
the
occasion
of
*NL*
veritable
triumph
.
The
whole
army
talked
of
this
expedition
for
a
day
,
*NL*
and
Monsieur
paid
him
his
compliments
upon
it
.
Besides
this
,
as
every
*NL*
great
action
bears
its
recompense
with
it
,
the
brave
exploit
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
resulted
in
the
restoration
of
the
tranquility
he
had
lost
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
d'Artagnan
believed
that
he
might
be
tranquil
,
as
one
of
his
*NL*
two
enemies
was
killed
and
the
other
devoted
to
his
interests
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tranquillity
proved
one
thing
--
that
d'Artagnan
did
not
yet
know
*NL*
Milady
.

THE
ANJOU
WINE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
most
disheartening
news
of
the
king
's
health
,
a
report
of
his
*NL*
convalescence
began
to
prevail
in
the
camp
;
and
as
he
was
very
anxious
*NL*
to
be
in
person
at
the
siege
,
it
was
said
that
as
soon
as
he
could
mount
*NL*
a
horse
he
would
set
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
Monsieur
,
who
knew
that
from
one
day
to
the
other
he
might
*NL*
expect
to
be
removed
from
his
command
by
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
by
*NL*
Bassompierre
,
or
by
Schomberg
,
who
were
all
eager
for
his
post
,
did
but
*NL*
little
,
lost
his
days
in
wavering
,
and
did
not
dare
to
attempt
any
great
*NL*
enterprise
to
drive
the
English
from
the
Isle
of
Re
,
where
they
still
*NL*
besieged
the
citadel
St.
Martin
and
the
fort
of
La
Pree
,
as
on
their
*NL*
side
the
French
were
besieging
La
Rochelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
become
more
tranquil
,
as
always
happens
*NL*
after
a
past
danger
,
particularly
when
the
danger
seems
to
have
*NL*
vanished
.
He
only
felt
one
uneasiness
,
and
that
was
at
not
hearing
any
*NL*
tidings
from
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
morning
at
the
commencement
of
the
month
of
November
everything
*NL*
was
explained
to
him
by
this
letter
,
dated
from
Villeroy
:
*NL*
*NL*
M
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
*NL*
MM
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
,
after
having
had
an
entertainment
at
my
*NL*
house
and
enjoying
themselves
very
much
,
created
such
a
disturbance
that
*NL*
the
provost
of
the
castle
,
a
rigid
man
,
has
ordered
them
to
be
confined
*NL*
for
some
days
;
but
I
accomplish
the
order
they
have
given
me
by
*NL*
forwarding
to
you
a
dozen
bottles
of
my
Anjou
wine
,
with
which
they
are
*NL*
much
pleased
.
They
are
desirous
that
you
should
drink
to
their
health
in
*NL*
their
favorite
wine
.
I
have
done
this
,
and
am
,
monsieur
,
with
great
*NL*
respect
,
*NL*
*NL*
Your
very
humble
and
obedient
servant
,
*NL*
*NL*
Godeau
,
Purveyor
of
the
Musketeers
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
well
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
They
think
of
me
in
their
*NL*
pleasures
,
as
I
thought
of
them
in
my
troubles
.
Well
,
I
will
certainly
*NL*
drink
to
their
health
with
all
my
heart
,
but
I
will
not
drink
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
went
among
those
Guardsmen
with
whom
he
had
formed
*NL*
greater
intimacy
than
with
the
others
,
to
invite
them
to
enjoy
with
him
*NL*
this
present
of
delicious
Anjou
wine
which
had
been
sent
him
from
*NL*
Villeroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
two
Guardsmen
was
engaged
that
evening
,
and
another
the
next
,
*NL*
so
the
meeting
was
fixed
for
the
day
after
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
on
his
return
,
sent
the
twelve
bottles
of
wine
to
the
*NL*
refreshment
room
of
the
Guards
,
with
strict
orders
that
great
care
*NL*
should
be
taken
of
it
;
and
then
,
on
the
day
appointed
,
as
the
dinner
was
*NL*
fixed
for
midday
d'Artagnan
sent
Planchet
at
nine
in
the
morning
to
*NL*
assist
in
preparing
everything
for
the
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
,
very
proud
of
being
raised
to
the
dignity
of
landlord
,
thought
*NL*
he
would
make
all
ready
,
like
an
intelligent
man
;
and
with
this
view
*NL*
called
in
the
assistance
of
the
lackey
of
one
of
his
master
's
guests
,
*NL*
named
Fourreau
,
and
the
false
soldier
who
had
tried
to
kill
d'Artagnan
*NL*
and
who
,
belonging
to
no
corps
,
had
entered
into
the
service
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
or
rather
of
Planchet
,
after
d'Artagnan
had
saved
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
of
the
banquet
being
come
,
the
two
guards
arrived
,
took
their
*NL*
places
,
and
the
dishes
were
arranged
on
the
table
.
Planchet
waited
,
*NL*
towel
on
arm
;
Fourreau
uncorked
the
bottles
;
and
Brisemont
,
which
was
*NL*
the
name
of
the
convalescent
,
poured
the
wine
,
which
was
a
little
shaken
*NL*
by
its
journey
,
carefully
into
decanters
.
Of
this
wine
,
the
first
bottle
*NL*
being
a
little
thick
at
the
bottom
,
Brisemont
poured
the
lees
into
a
*NL*
glass
,
and
d'Artagnan
desired
him
to
drink
it
,
for
the
poor
devil
had
*NL*
not
yet
recovered
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
having
eaten
the
soup
,
were
about
to
lift
the
first
glass
of
*NL*
wine
to
their
lips
,
when
all
at
once
the
cannon
sounded
from
Fort
Louis
*NL*
and
Fort
Neuf
.
The
Guardsmen
,
imagining
this
to
be
caused
by
some
*NL*
unexpected
attack
,
either
of
the
besieged
or
the
English
,
sprang
to
*NL*
their
swords
.
D'Artagnan
,
not
less
forward
than
they
,
did
likewise
,
and
*NL*
all
ran
out
,
in
order
to
repair
to
their
posts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
scarcely
were
they
out
of
the
room
before
they
were
made
aware
of
*NL*
the
cause
of
this
noise
.
Cries
of
``
Live
the
king
!
Live
the
cardinal
!
''
*NL*
resounded
on
every
side
,
and
the
drums
were
beaten
in
all
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
the
king
,
impatient
,
as
has
been
said
,
had
come
by
forced
*NL*
marches
,
and
had
that
moment
arrived
with
all
his
household
and
a
*NL*
reinforcement
of
ten
thousand
troops
.
His
Musketeers
proceeded
and
*NL*
followed
him
.
D'Artagnan
,
placed
in
line
with
his
company
,
saluted
with
*NL*
an
expressive
gesture
his
three
friends
,
whose
eyes
soon
discovered
him
,
*NL*
and
M.
de
Treville
,
who
detected
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ceremony
of
reception
over
,
the
four
friends
were
soon
in
one
*NL*
another
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
could
not
have
arrived
in
better
time
;
*NL*
the
dinner
can
not
have
had
time
to
get
cold
!
Can
it
,
gentlemen
?
''
added
*NL*
the
young
man
,
turning
to
the
two
Guards
,
whom
he
introduced
to
his
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
Porthos
,
``
it
appears
we
are
feasting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
there
are
no
women
at
your
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
drinkable
wine
in
your
tavern
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
pardieu
!
there
is
yours
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
wine
!
''
said
Athos
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
you
sent
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
sent
you
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
very
well
--
the
wine
from
the
hills
of
Anjou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
what
brand
you
are
talking
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wine
you
prefer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
the
absence
of
champagne
and
chambertin
,
you
must
content
*NL*
yourselves
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
connoisseurs
in
wine
as
we
are
,
we
have
sent
you
some
Anjou
*NL*
wine
?
''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
,
it
is
the
wine
that
was
sent
by
your
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
our
account
?
''
said
the
three
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
send
this
wine
,
Aramis
?
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
you
,
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
you
,
Athos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
was
not
you
,
it
was
your
purveyor

''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
purveyor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
purveyor
,
Godeau
--
the
purveyor
of
the
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
!
never
mind
where
it
comes
from

''
said
Porthos
,
``
let
us
taste
*NL*
it
,
and
if
it
is
good
,
let
us
drink
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
do
n't
let
us
drink
wine
which
comes
from
an
unknown
*NL*
source
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Athos
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Did
none
of
you
charge
your
*NL*
purveyor
,
Godeau
,
to
send
me
some
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
And
yet
you
say
he
has
sent
you
some
as
from
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
his
letter
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
and
he
presented
the
note
to
his
*NL*
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
his
writing
!
''
said
Athos
.
``
I
am
acquainted
with
it
;
before
*NL*
we
left
Villeroy
I
settled
the
accounts
of
the
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
false
letter
altogether
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
we
have
not
been
*NL*
disciplined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Aramis
,
in
a
reproachful
tone
,
``
how
could
you
believe
*NL*
that
we
had
made
a
disturbance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
grew
pale
,
and
a
convulsive
trembling
shook
all
his
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
alarmest
me
!
''
said
Athos
,
who
never
used
thee
and
thou
but
upon
*NL*
very
particular
occasions
,
``
what
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
you
,
my
friends
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
a
horrible
suspicion
crosses
*NL*
my
mind
!
Can
this
be
another
vengeance
of
that
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
Athos
who
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
rushed
toward
the
refreshment
room
,
the
three
Musketeers
and
*NL*
the
two
Guards
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
object
that
met
the
eyes
of
d'Artagnan
on
entering
the
room
*NL*
was
Brisemont
,
stretched
upon
the
ground
and
rolling
in
horrible
*NL*
convulsions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
and
Fourreau
,
as
pale
as
death
,
were
trying
to
give
him
succor
;
*NL*
but
it
was
plain
that
all
assistance
was
useless
--
all
the
features
of
*NL*
the
dying
man
were
distorted
with
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
he
,
on
perceiving
d'Artagnan
,
``
ah
!
this
is
frightful
!
You
*NL*
pretend
to
pardon
me
,
and
you
poison
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
,
wretch
?
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
it
was
you
who
gave
me
the
wine
;
I
say
that
it
was
you
who
*NL*
desired
me
to
drink
it
.
I
say
you
wished
to
avenge
yourself
on
me
,
and
I
*NL*
say
that
it
is
horrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
think
so
,
Brisemont
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
do
not
think
so
.
I
swear
*NL*
to
you
,
I
protest
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
God
is
above
!
God
will
punish
you

My
God

grant
that
he
may
*NL*
one
day
suffer
what
I
suffer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
the
Gospel
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
throwing
himself
down
by
the
dying
*NL*
man
,
``
I
swear
to
you
that
the
wine
was
poisoned
and
that
I
was
going
to
*NL*
drink
of
it
as
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
you
,
''
cried
the
soldier
,
and
he
expired
amid
horrible
*NL*
tortures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightful
!
frightful
!
''
murmured
Athos
,
while
Porthos
broke
the
bottles
*NL*
and
Aramis
gave
orders
,
a
little
too
late
,
that
a
confessor
should
be
*NL*
sent
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
friends
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
come
once
more
to
save
my
life
,
*NL*
not
only
mine
but
that
of
these
gentlemen
.
Gentlemen

''
continued
he
,
*NL*
addressing
the
Guardsmen
,
``
I
request
you
will
be
silent
with
regard
to
*NL*
this
adventure

Great
personages

have
had

the
evil
would
only
recoil
upon
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

monsieur

stammered
Planchet
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
``
ah
,
monsieur
,
*NL*
what
an
escape
I
have
had
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

you
were
going
to
drink
my
wine

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
health
of
the
king

monsieur

I
was
going
to
drink
a
small
glass
*NL*
of
it
if
Fourreau
had
not
told
me
I
was
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Fourreau
,
whose
teeth
chattered
with
terror
,
``
I
wanted
to
*NL*
get
him
out
of
the
way
that
I
might
drink
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
addressing
the
Guardsmen
,
``
you
may
easily
*NL*
comprehend
that
such
a
feast
can
only
be
very
dull
after
what
has
taken
*NL*
place
;
so
accept
my
excuses
,
and
put
off
the
party
till
another
day
,
I
*NL*
beg
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Guardsmen
courteously
accepted
d'Artagnan
's
excuses
,
and
*NL*
perceiving
that
the
four
friends
desired
to
be
alone
,
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
Guardsman
and
the
three
Musketeers
were
without
*NL*
witnesses
,
they
looked
at
one
another
with
an
air
which
plainly
*NL*
expressed
that
each
of
them
perceived
the
gravity
of
their
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
let
us
leave
this
chamber
;
the
dead
*NL*
are
not
agreeable
company

particularly
when
they
have
died
a
violent
*NL*
death
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
commit
the
corpse
of
this
poor
devil
to
*NL*
your
care

Let
him
be
interred
in
holy
ground
.
He
committed
a
crime
,
it
*NL*
is
true
;
but
he
repented
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
four
friends
quit
the
room
,
leaving
to
Planchet
and
Fourreau
the
*NL*
duty
of
paying
mortuary
honors
to
Brisemont
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
gave
them
another
chamber
,
and
served
them
with
fresh
eggs
and
*NL*
some
water
,
which
Athos
went
himself
to
draw
at
the
fountain
.
In
a
few
*NL*
words
,
Porthos
and
Aramis
were
posted
as
to
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
Athos
,
``
you
see
,
my
dear
friend
,
that
this
is
*NL*
war
to
the
death

*NL*
*NL*
Athos
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

replied
he
,
``
I
perceive
that
plainly

you
really

*NL*
*NL*

I
am
sure

*NL*

Nevertheless

But

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

*NL*
*NL*

repeated
d'Artagnan

reflect
how

*NL*
``
Yes

I
should

effectually

*NL*
It
was
d'Artagnan

now
shook
his

in
his
turn

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in

what
is

the

said
Athos

*NL*
``
But
how

*NL*
*NL*

Listen

*NL*

Very

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

said
Porthos
,
placing
a
finger
on
his
lips

``
I
believe

the
four

had
finished

repast

separated

with
the
promise

meeting
again

evening

*NL*
D'Artagnan
returned
to
less
important
affairs

and
the

THE
SIGN
OF
THE
RED
DOVECOT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
king
,
who
,
with
more
reason
than
the
cardinal
,
showed
his
*NL*
hatred
for
Buckingham
,
although
scarcely
arrived
was
in
such
a
haste
to
*NL*
meet
the
enemy
that
he
commanded
every
disposition
to
be
made
to
drive
*NL*
the
English
from
the
Isle
of
Re
,
and
afterward
to
press
the
siege
of
La
*NL*
Rochelle
;
but
notwithstanding
his
earnest
wish
,
he
was
delayed
by
the
*NL*
dissensions
which
broke
out
between
MM
Bassompierre
and
Schomberg
,
*NL*
against
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
.
*NL*
*NL*
MM
Bassompierre
and
Schomberg
were
marshals
of
France
,
and
claimed
their
*NL*
right
of
commanding
the
army
under
the
orders
of
the
king
;
but
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
who
feared
that
Bassompierre
,
a
Huguenot
at
heart
,
might
press
*NL*
but
feebly
the
English
and
Rochellais
,
his
brothers
in
religion
,
*NL*
supported
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
whom
the
king
,
at
his
instigation
,
had
*NL*
named
lieutenant
general
.
The
result
was
that
to
prevent
MM
Bassompierre
*NL*
and
Schomberg
from
deserting
the
army
,
a
separate
command
had
to
be
*NL*
given
to
each
.
Bassompierre
took
up
his
quarters
on
the
north
of
the
*NL*
city
,
between
Leu
and
Dompierre
;
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
on
the
east
,
from
*NL*
Dompierre
to
Perigny
;
and
M.
de
Schomberg
on
the
south
,
from
Perigny
to
*NL*
Angoutin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quarters
of
Monsieur
were
at
Dompierre
;
the
quarters
of
the
king
*NL*
were
sometimes
at
Estree
,
sometimes
at
Jarrie
;
the
cardinal
's
quarters
*NL*
were
upon
the
downs
,
at
the
bridge
of
La
Pierre
,
in
a
simple
house
*NL*
without
any
entrenchment
.
So
that
Monsieur
watched
Bassompierre
;
the
*NL*
king
,
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
;
and
the
cardinal
,
M.
de
Schomberg
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
this
organization
was
established
,
they
set
about
driving
the
*NL*
English
from
the
Isle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
juncture
was
favorable
.
The
English
,
who
require
,
above
everything
,
*NL*
good
living
in
order
to
be
good
soldiers
,
only
eating
salt
meat
and
bad
*NL*
biscuit
,
had
many
invalids
in
their
camp
.
Still
further
,
the
sea
,
very
*NL*
rough
at
this
period
of
the
year
all
along
the
sea
coast
,
destroyed
*NL*
every
day
some
little
vessel
;
and
the
shore
,
from
the
point
of
*NL*
l'Aiguillon
to
the
trenches
,
was
at
every
tide
literally
covered
with
*NL*
the
wrecks
of
pinnacles
,
roberges
,
and
feluccas
.
The
result
was
that
*NL*
even
if
the
king
's
troops
remained
quietly
in
their
camp
,
it
was
evident
*NL*
that
some
day
or
other
,
Buckingham
,
who
only
continued
in
the
Isle
from
*NL*
obstinacy
,
would
be
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
M.
de
Toiras
gave
information
that
everything
was
preparing
in
*NL*
the
enemy
's
camp
for
a
fresh
assault
,
the
king
judged
that
it
would
be
*NL*
best
to
put
an
end
to
the
affair
,
and
gave
the
necessary
orders
for
a
*NL*
decisive
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
is
not
our
intention
to
give
a
journal
of
the
siege
,
but
on
the
*NL*
contrary
only
to
describe
such
of
the
events
of
it
as
are
connected
with
*NL*
the
story
we
are
relating
,
we
will
content
ourselves
with
saying
in
two
*NL*
words
that
the
expedition
succeeded
,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
*NL*
king
and
the
great
glory
of
the
cardinal
.
The
English
,
repulsed
foot
by
*NL*
foot
,
beaten
in
all
encounters
,
and
defeated
in
the
passage
of
the
Isle
*NL*
of
Loie
,
were
obliged
to
re-embark
,
leaving
on
the
field
of
battle
two
*NL*
thousand
men
,
among
whom
were
five
colonels
,
three
lieutenant
colonels
,
*NL*
two
hundred
and
fifty
captains
,
twenty
gentlemen
of
rank
,
four
pieces
of
*NL*
cannon
,
and
sixty
flags
,
which
were
taken
to
Paris
by
Claude
de
St.
*NL*
Simon
,
and
suspended
with
great
pomp
in
the
arches
of
Notre
Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Te
Deums
were
chanted
in
camp
,
and
afterward
throughout
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
was
left
free
to
carry
on
the
siege
,
without
having
,
at
*NL*
least
at
the
present
,
anything
to
fear
on
the
part
of
the
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
must
be
acknowledged
,
this
response
was
but
momentary
.
An
envoy
*NL*
of
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
named
Montague
,
was
taken
,
and
proof
was
*NL*
obtained
of
a
league
between
the
German
Empire
,
Spain
,
England
,
and
*NL*
Lorraine
.
This
league
was
directed
against
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
further
,
in
Buckingham
's
lodging
,
which
he
had
been
forced
to
*NL*
abandon
more
precipitately
than
he
expected
,
papers
were
found
which
*NL*
confirmed
this
alliance
and
which
,
as
the
cardinal
asserts
in
his
*NL*
memoirs
,
strongly
compromised
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
and
consequently
the
*NL*
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
upon
the
cardinal
that
all
the
responsibility
fell
,
for
one
is
*NL*
not
a
despotic
minister
without
responsibility
.
All
,
therefore
,
of
the
*NL*
vast
resources
of
his
genius
were
at
work
night
and
day
,
engaged
in
*NL*
listening
to
the
least
report
heard
in
any
of
the
great
kingdoms
of
*NL*
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
was
acquainted
with
the
activity
,
and
more
particularly
the
*NL*
hatred
,
of
Buckingham
.
If
the
league
which
threatened
France
triumphed
,
*NL*
all
his
influence
would
be
lost
.
Spanish
policy
and
Austrian
policy
*NL*
would
have
their
representatives
in
the
cabinet
of
the
Louvre
,
where
*NL*
they
had
as
yet
but
partisans
;
and
he
,
Richelieu
--
the
French
minister
,
*NL*
the
national
minister
--
would
be
ruined
.
The
king
,
even
while
obeying
him
*NL*
like
a
child
,
hated
him
as
a
child
hates
his
master
,
and
would
abandon
*NL*
him
to
the
personal
vengeance
of
Monsieur
and
the
queen
.
He
would
then
*NL*
be
lost
,
and
France
,
perhaps
,
with
him
.
All
this
must
be
prepared
*NL*
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courtiers
,
becoming
every
instant
more
numerous
,
succeeded
one
another
,
*NL*
day
and
night
,
in
the
little
house
of
the
bridge
of
La
Pierre
,
in
which
*NL*
the
cardinal
had
established
his
residence
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
monks
who
wore
the
frock
with
such
an
ill
grace
that
it
was
*NL*
easy
to
perceive
they
belonged
to
the
church
militant
;
women
a
little
*NL*
inconvenienced
by
their
costume
as
pages
and
whose
large
trousers
could
*NL*
not
entirely
conceal
their
rounded
forms
;
and
peasants
with
blackened
*NL*
hands
but
with
fine
limbs
,
savoring
of
the
man
of
quality
a
league
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
also
less
agreeable
visits
--
for
two
or
three
times
reports
*NL*
were
spread
that
the
cardinal
had
nearly
been
assassinated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
the
enemies
of
the
cardinal
said
that
it
was
he
himself
*NL*
who
set
these
bungling
assassins
to
work
,
in
order
to
have
,
if
wanted
,
*NL*
the
right
of
using
reprisals
;
but
we
must
not
believe
everything
*NL*
ministers
say
,
nor
everything
their
enemies
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
attempts
did
not
prevent
the
cardinal
,
to
whom
his
most
inveterate
*NL*
detractors
have
never
denied
personal
bravery
,
from
making
nocturnal
*NL*
excursions
,
sometimes
to
communicate
to
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
important
*NL*
orders
,
sometimes
to
confer
with
the
king
,
and
sometimes
to
have
an
*NL*
interview
with
a
messenger
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
see
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
part
the
Musketeers
,
who
had
not
much
to
do
with
the
siege
,
*NL*
were
not
under
very
strict
orders
and
led
a
joyous
life
.
This
was
the
*NL*
more
easy
for
our
three
companions
in
particular
;
for
being
friends
of
*NL*
M.
de
Treville
,
they
obtained
from
him
special
permission
to
be
absent
*NL*
after
the
closing
of
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
one
evening
when
d'Artagnan
,
who
was
in
the
trenches
,
was
not
able
*NL*
to
accompany
them
,
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
,
mounted
on
their
battle
*NL*
steeds
,
enveloped
in
their
war
cloaks
,
with
their
hands
upon
their
*NL*
pistol
butts
,
were
returning
from
a
drinking
place
called
the
Red
*NL*
Dovecot
,
which
Athos
had
discovered
two
days
before
upon
the
route
to
*NL*
Jarrie
,
following
the
road
which
led
to
the
camp
and
quite
on
their
*NL*
guard
,
as
we
have
stated
,
for
fear
of
an
ambuscade
,
when
,
about
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
league
from
the
village
of
Boisnau
,
they
fancied
they
heard
*NL*
the
sound
of
horses
approaching
them
.
They
immediately
all
three
halted
,
*NL*
closed
in
,
and
waited
,
occupying
the
middle
of
the
road
.
In
an
instant
,
*NL*
and
as
the
moon
broke
from
behind
a
cloud
,
they
saw
at
a
turning
of
the
*NL*
road
two
horsemen
who
,
on
perceiving
them
,
stopped
in
their
turn
,
*NL*
appearing
to
deliberate
whether
they
should
continue
their
route
or
go
*NL*
back
.
The
hesitation
created
some
suspicion
in
the
three
friends
,
and
*NL*
Athos
,
advancing
a
few
paces
in
front
of
the
others
,
cried
in
a
firm
*NL*
voice
,
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
there
,
yourselves
?
''
replied
one
of
the
horsemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
an
answer
,
''
replied
Athos
.
``
Who
goes
there
?
Answer
,
or
we
*NL*
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
of
what
you
are
about
,
gentlemen
!
''
said
a
clear
voice
which
*NL*
seemed
accustomed
to
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
some
superior
officer
making
his
night
rounds
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
What
*NL*
do
you
wish
,
gentlemen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
said
the
same
voice
,
in
the
same
commanding
tone
.
``
Answer
*NL*
in
your
turn
,
or
you
may
repent
of
your
disobedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
King
's
Musketeers
,
''
said
Athos
,
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
who
*NL*
interrogated
them
had
the
right
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
company
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Company
of
Treville
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Advance
,
and
give
an
account
of
what
you
are
doing
here
at
this
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
companions
advanced
rather
humbly
--
for
all
were
now
convinced
*NL*
that
they
had
to
do
with
someone
more
powerful
than
themselves
--
leaving
*NL*
Athos
the
post
of
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
two
riders
,
he
who
had
spoken
second
,
was
ten
paces
in
front
*NL*
of
his
companion
.
Athos
made
a
sign
to
Porthos
and
Aramis
also
to
remain
*NL*
in
the
rear
,
and
advanced
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
pardon
,
my
officer
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
but
we
were
ignorant
with
whom
*NL*
we
had
to
do
,
and
you
may
see
that
we
were
keeping
good
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
said
the
officer
,
who
covered
a
part
of
his
face
with
his
*NL*
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
yourself
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Athos
,
who
began
to
be
annoyed
by
this
*NL*
inquisition
,
``
give
me
,
I
beg
you
,
the
proof
that
you
have
the
right
to
*NL*
question
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
name
?
''
repeated
the
cavalier
a
second
time
,
letting
his
cloak
*NL*
fall
,
and
leaving
his
face
uncovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
the
Cardinal
!
''
cried
the
stupefied
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

cried
his
Eminence
,
for
the
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Athos

said
the
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
made
a
sign
to
his
attendant
,
who
drew
near
.
``
These
three
*NL*
Musketeers

follow
us

said
he
,
in
an
undertone
.
``
I
am
not
willing

be
certain
they
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

Athos
;

no

Thank
God

keep

*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
fixed
his
piercing
eyes
on
this
courageous
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
quick
ear
,
Monsieur
Athos

said
the
cardinal
;
``

now

for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Athos
,
while
the
two
Musketeers
who
had
*NL*
remained
behind
advanced
hat
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

said
the
cardinal
,
``
I

I

I
am
sorry

I
know

*NL*
The
three
Musketeers
bowed
to
the
necks
of
their
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
upon
my
honor

said
Athos
,
``
your
Eminence
is
right
in
taking
us

with

we
have
seen
several
ill-looking

we
*NL*
have
even
had
a
quarrel
at
the
Red
Dovecot
with
four
of
those
faces

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarrel

what
for

said
the
cardinal
;
``
you
know
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
quarrelers

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
the
reason
why
I
have
the
honor
to
inform
your
Eminence
of

what
has
happened

for
you
might
learn
it
from
others

upon
a
false

account
believe
us
to
be
in
fault

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
been
the
results

knitting
his
brow

``
My

here

has
received
a

sword
wound

not
enough

may
see

mounting

assault
tomorrow

cardinal

Come

Athos

I
did
not

I
took

him
who
offended

round
the

threw
him
out

the
window

It
*NL*
appears
that

falling

continued
Athos

with
some
hesitation

``
he

broke
his

``
Ah

Porthos

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
monseigneur

knowing
that
dueling
is
prohibited

I
seized
a
bench

gave
one

those
brigands
such
a
blow
that
I
believe
his
shoulder
*NL*
is
broken

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

the
cardinal

you

Monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur

which
Monseigneur

not
aware

about

I
*NL*
endeavored
to
appease

one
of
these
wretches
gave
me
a

wound
with
a
sword

treacherously

across
my
left
arm

Then
I
admit
my
*NL*
patience
failed
me

I
drew
my
sword
in
my
turn

as
he
came
back

I
fancied
I
felt
that

he
let

I
only
know

added
he
,
``
to
change
the

*NL*
``
The
lady
had

Athos

The
three
Musketeers
passed
behind
his
Eminence
,
who
again
enveloped
his
*NL*
face
in
his
cloak
,
and
put
his
horse
in
motion
,
keeping
from
eight
to
*NL*
ten
paces
in
advance
of
his
four
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
arrived
at
the
silent
,
solitary
inn
.
No
doubt
the
host
knew
*NL*
what
illustrious
visitor
was
expected
,
and
had
consequently
sent
*NL*
intruders
out
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
paces
from
the
door
the
cardinal
made
a
sign
to
his
esquire
and
the
*NL*
three
Musketeers
to
halt
.
A
saddled
horse
was
fastened
to
the
window
*NL*
shutter
.
The
cardinal
knocked
three
times
,
and
in
a
peculiar
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
,
enveloped
in
a
cloak
,
came
out
immediately
,
and
exchanged
some
*NL*
rapid
words
with
the
cardinal
;
after
which
he
mounted
his
horse
,
and
set
*NL*
off
in
the
direction
of
Surgeres
,
which
was
likewise
the

*NL*
``
Advance

said
the
cardinal

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
told
me
the
truth

said
he
,
addressing
the
*NL*
Musketeers
,
``
and
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if

this
evening

not
advantageous

In
the
meantime

follow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
alighted
;
the
three
Musketeers
did
likewise
.
The
cardinal
*NL*
threw
the
bridle
of
his
horse
to
his
esquire
;
the
three
Musketeers
*NL*
fastened
the
horses
to
the
shutters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
stood
at
the
door
.
For
him
,
the
cardinal
was
only
an
officer
*NL*
coming
to
visit
a
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
where
these
gentlemen
can
wait
*NL*
near
a
good
fire
?
''
said
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
opened
the
door
of
a
large
room
,
in
which
an
old
stove
had
just
*NL*
been
replaced
by
a
large
and
excellent
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
this
,

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

do

replied
the
cardinal
.
``
Enter

enough

not

an

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
the
three
Musketeers
entered
the
ground
floor
room
,
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
without
asking
further
information
,
ascended
the
staircase
*NL*
like
a
man
who
has
no
need
of

pointed
out

THE
UTILITY
OF
STOVEPIPES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
without
suspecting
it
,
and
actuated
solely
by
their
*NL*
chivalrous
and
adventurous
character
,
our
three
friends
had
just
*NL*
rendered
a
service
to
someone
the
cardinal
honored
with
his
special
*NL*
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
who
was
that
someone
?
That
was
the
question
the
three
Musketeers
*NL*
put
to
one
another
.
Then
,
seeing
that
none
of
their
replies
could
throw
*NL*
any
light
on
the
subject
,
Porthos
called
the
host
and
asked
for
dice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
placed
themselves
at
the
table
and
began
to
play
.
*NL*
Athos
walked
about
in
a
contemplative
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
thinking
and
walking
,
Athos
passed
and
repassed
before
the
pipe
of
*NL*
the
stove
,
broken
in
halves
,
the
other
extremity
passing
into
the
*NL*
chamber
above
;
and
every
time
he
passed
and
repassed
he
heard
a
murmur
*NL*
of
words
,
which
at
length
fixed
his
attention
.
Athos
went
close
to
it
,
*NL*
and
distinguished
some
words
that
appeared
to
merit
so
great
an
interest
*NL*
that
he
made
a
sign
to
his
friends
to
be
silent
,
remaining
himself
bent
*NL*
with
his
ear
directed
to
the
opening
of
the
lower
orifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
Milady
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
the
affair
is
important
.
Sit
down
,
*NL*
and
let
us
talk
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Milady
!
''
murmured
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
listen
to
your
Eminence
with
greatest
attention
,
''
replied
a
female
*NL*
voice
which
made
the
Musketeer
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
small
vessel
with
an
English
crew
,
whose
captain
is
on
my
side
,
*NL*
awaits
you
at
the
mouth
of
Charente
,
at
Fort
La

will
set
*NL*
sail
tomorrow
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
_

Fort
La

Vasou

was
not
built
until
1672

nearly
50
years
later

*NL*
*NL*
``

must
go
thither
tonight

*NL*
*NL*
``

going
out

serve

allow

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
instant
of
profound
silence
between
the
two
interlocutors
.
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
the
cardinal
was
weighing
beforehand
the
terms
in
*NL*
which
he
was
about
to
speak
,
and
that
Milady
was
collecting
all
her
*NL*
intellectual
faculties
to
comprehend
the
things
he
was
about
to
say
,
and
*NL*
to
engrave
them
in
her
memory
when
they
should
be
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
advantage
of
this
moment
to
tell
his
two
companions
to
fasten
*NL*
the
door
inside
,
and
to
make
them
a
sign
to
come
and
listen
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Musketeers
,
who
loved
their
ease
,
brought
a
chair
for
each
of
*NL*
themselves
and
one
for
Athos
.
All
three
then
sat
down
with
their
heads
*NL*
together
and
their
ears
on
the
alert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
to
London

continued
the
cardinal
.
``
Arrived

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Milady

distrusts

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

de
Montpensier
,

the
*NL*
Queen
Marie
de

I
should
use
less
precautions
than
I
take
,
being
*NL*
simply
called
Milady
Clarik
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
,
''
said
Richelieu
.
``
What
do
you
require
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
require
an
order
which
would
ratify
beforehand
all
that
I
should
*NL*
think
proper
to
do
for
the
greatest
good
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
first
place

this

I
have

avenging
herself
upon
the
duke

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
found

said
Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
He
will
be
found

the
cardinal

then
it
will
be
time

claim
the

you
just
now
required

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Eminence
is
right

replied
Milady
;
``
and
I
have
been
wrong
in
*NL*
seeing
in
the
mission
with
which
you
honor
me
anything
but
that
which
it
*NL*
really
is
--
that
is
,
to
announce
to
his
Grace
,
on
the
part
of
your
*NL*
Eminence
,
that
you
are
acquainted
with
the
different
disguises
by
means
*NL*
of
which
he
succeeded
in
approaching
the
queen
during
the
fete
given
by
*NL*
Madame
the
Constable
;
that
you
have
proofs
of
the
interview
granted
at
*NL*
the
Louvre
by
the
queen
to
a
certain
Italian
astrologer
who
was
no
other
*NL*
than
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
;
that
you
have
ordered
a
little
romance
of
a
*NL*
satirical
nature
to
be
written
upon
the
adventures
of
Amiens
,
with
a
*NL*
plan
of
the
gardens
in
which
those
adventures
took
place
,
and
portraits
*NL*
of
the
actors
who
figured
in
them
;
that
Montague
is
in
the
Bastille
,
and
*NL*
that
the
torture
may
make
him
say
things
he
remembers
,
and
even
things
*NL*
he
has
forgotten
;
that
you
possess
a
certain
letter
from
Madame
de
*NL*
Chevreuse
,
found
in
his
Grace
's
lodging
,
which
singularly
compromises
*NL*
not
only
her
who
wrote
it
,
but
her
in
whose
name
it
was
written
.
Then
,
*NL*
if
he
persists
,
notwithstanding
all
this
--
as
that
is
,
as
I
have
said
,
*NL*
the
limit
of
my
mission
--
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
pray
God
to
*NL*
work
a
miracle
for
the
salvation
of
France

it

it
not

have
nothing

do

That

the
cardinal

dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now

said
Milady
,
without
appearing
to
remark
the
change
of
the
*NL*
duke

tone
toward
her
--

Here

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
silence
,
which
proved
that
the
cardinal
was
*NL*
employed
in
seeking
the
terms
in
which
he
should
write
the
note
,
or
else
*NL*
in
writing
it

Athos
,
who
had
not
lost
a
word
of
the
conversation

took
*NL*
his
two
companions
by
the
hand

led
them
to
the
other
end

the
*NL*
room

*NL*
*NL*
``

Porthos

Porthos

*NL*
*NL*

You

given

reason

I
will
say
two
words

about
it
to
the
cardinal

esquire

The
rest

myself

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be

*NL*
Porthos

resumed
their
places
by
the
stovepipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Athos
,
he
went
out
without
any
mystery
,
took
his
horse
,
which
was
*NL*
tied
with
those
of
his
friends
to
the
fastenings
of
the
shutters
,
in
*NL*
four
words
convinced
the
attendant
of
the
necessity
of
a
vanguard
for
*NL*
their
return
,
carefully
examined
the
priming
of
his
pistols
,
drew
his

sword
,

took

like

forlorn
hope

the
road

A
CONJUGAL
SCENE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Athos
had
foreseen
,
it
was
not
long
before
the
cardinal
came
down
.
He
*NL*
opened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
Musketeers
were
,
and
found
*NL*
Porthos
playing
an
earnest
game
of
dice
with
Aramis
.
He
cast
a
rapid
*NL*
glance
around
the
room
,
and
perceived
that
one
of
his
men
was
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
Monseigneur
Athos
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
replied
Porthos
,
``
he
has
gone
as
a
scout
,
on
account
of
*NL*
some
words
of
our
host
,
which
made
him
believe
the
road
was
not
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
what
have
you
done
,
Monsieur
Porthos
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
won
five
pistoles
of
Aramis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
now
will
you
return
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
at
your
Eminence
's
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
horse
,
then
,
gentlemen
;
for
it
is
getting
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
was
at
the
door
,
holding
the
cardinal
's
horse
by
the
*NL*
bridle
.
At
a
short
distance
a
group
of
two
men
and
three
horses
appeared
*NL*
in
the
shade
.
These
were
the
two
men
who
were
to
conduct
Milady
to
Fort
*NL*
La
Pointe
,
and
superintend
her
embarkation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attendant
confirmed
to
the
cardinal
what
the
two
Musketeers
had
*NL*
already
said
with
respect
to
Athos
.
The
cardinal
made
an
approving
*NL*
gesture
,
and
retraced
his
route
with
the
same
precautions
he
had
used
*NL*
incoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
leave
him
to
follow
the
road
to
the
camp
protected
by
his
esquire
*NL*
and
the
two
Musketeers
,
and
return
to
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
hundred
paces
he
maintained
the
speed
at
which
he
started
;
but
*NL*
when
out
of
sight
he
turned
his
horse
to
the
right
,
made
a
circuit
,
and
*NL*
came
back
within
twenty
paces
of
a
high
hedge
to
watch
the
passage
of
*NL*
the
little
troop
.
Having
recognized
the
laced
hats
of
his
companions
and
*NL*
the
golden
fringe
of
the
cardinal
's
cloak
,
he
waited
till
the
horsemen
*NL*
had
turned
the
angle
of
the
road
,
and
having
lost
sight
of
them
,
he
*NL*
returned
at
a
gallop
to
the
inn
,
which
was
opened
to
him
without
*NL*
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
recognized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
officer
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
has
forgotten
to
give
a
piece
of
very
*NL*
important
information
to
the
lady
,
and
has
sent
me
back
to
repair
his
*NL*
forgetfulness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
up
,
''
said
the
host
;
``
she
is
still
in
her
chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
availed
himself
of
the
permission
,
ascended
the
stairs
with
his
*NL*
lightest
step
,
gained
the
landing
,
and
through
the
open
door
perceived
*NL*
Milady
putting
on
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
chamber
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
At
the
noise
he
*NL*
made
in
pushing
the
bolt
,
Milady
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
was
standing
before
the
door
,
enveloped
in
his
cloak
,
with
his
hat
*NL*
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
.
On
seeing
this
figure
,
mute
and
immovable
as
*NL*
a
statue
,
Milady
was
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
and
what
do
you
want
?
''
cried
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
,
''
murmured
Athos
,
``
it
is
certainly
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
letting
fall
his
cloak
and
raising
his
hat
,
he
advanced
toward
*NL*
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
me
,
madame
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
made
one
step
forward
,
and
then
drew
back
as
if
she
had
seen
a
*NL*
serpent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
well
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
I
perceive
you
know
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Comte
de
la
Fere
!
''
murmured
Milady
,
becoming
exceedingly
pale
,
and
*NL*
drawing
back
till
the
wall
prevented
her
from
going
any
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Milady
,
''
replied
Athos
;
``
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
in
person
,
who
comes
*NL*
expressly
from
the
other
world
to
have
the
pleasure
of
paying
you
a
*NL*
visit
.
Sit
down
,
madame
,
and
let
us
talk
,
as
the
cardinal
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
under
the
influence
of
inexpressible
terror
,
sat
down
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
are
a
demon
sent
upon
the
earth
!

said
Athos

Your
power

is
great

I
know

you
also
know
that
with
the
help
of
God

*NL*
often
conquered
the
most
terrible
demons

You
have
once
before
thrown
*NL*
yourself
in
my
path

I
thought
I
had
crushed
you

either
I
*NL*
was
deceived

hell
has
resuscitated
you

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
at
these
words
,
which
recalled
frightful
remembrances
,
hung
down
*NL*
her
head
with
a
suppressed
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
hell
has
resuscitated
you

continued
Athos
.
``
Hell
has
made
you
*NL*
rich

hell
has
given
you
another
name

hell
has
almost
made
you
another

face
;
but
it
has
neither
effaced
the
stains
from
your
soul
nor
the
brand
*NL*
from
your
body

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
arose
as
if
moved
by
a
powerful
spring
,
and
her
eyes
flashed
*NL*
lightning
.
Athos
remained
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
believed
me
to
be
dead
,
did
you
not
,
as
I
believed
you
to
be
?
And
*NL*
the
name
of
Athos
as
well
concealed
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
,
as
the
name
*NL*
Milady
Clarik
concealed
Anne
de
Breuil

Was
it
not
so
you
were
called
*NL*
when
your
honored
brother
married
us
?
Our
position
is
truly
a
strange
*NL*
one
,
''
continued
Athos
,
laughing
.
``
We
have
only
lived
up
to
the
present
*NL*
time
because
we
believed
each
other
dead
,
and
because
a
remembrance
is
*NL*
less
oppressive
than
a
living
creature
,
though
a
remembrance
is
*NL*
sometimes
devouring
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

''
said
Milady
,
in
a
hollow
,
faint
voice
,
``
what
brings
you
back
to
*NL*
me
,
and
what
do
you
want
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
relate

this
evening

*NL*
*NL*
A
smile
of
incredulity
passed
over
the
pale
lips
of
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
It
was
you
who
cut
off
the
two
diamond
studs
from
the
shoulder
*NL*
of
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
;
it
was
you
had
the
Madame
Bonacieux
carried
*NL*
off
;
it
was
you
who
,
in
love
with
de
Wardes
and
thinking
to
pass
the
*NL*
night
with
him
,
opened
the
door
to
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
;
it
was
you
who
,
*NL*
believing
that
de
Wardes
had
deceived
you
,
wished
to
have
him
killed
by
*NL*
his
rival
;
it
was
you
who
,
when
this
rival
had
discovered
your
infamous
*NL*
secret
,
wished
to
have
him
killed
in
his
turn
by
two
assassins
,
whom
you
*NL*
sent
in
pursuit
of
him
;
it
was
you
who
,
finding
the
balls
had
missed
*NL*
their
mark
,
sent
poisoned
wine
with
a
forged
letter
,
to
make
your
victim
*NL*
believe
that
the
wine
came
from
his
friends
.
In
short
,
it
was
you
who
*NL*
have
but
now
in
this
chamber
,
seated
in
this
chair
I
now
fill
,
made
an
*NL*
engagement
with
Cardinal
Richelieu
to
cause
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
to
be
*NL*
assassinated
,
in
exchange
for
the
promise
he
has
made
you
to
allow
you
*NL*
to
assassinate
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
livid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
Satan
!
''
cried
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
But
at
all
events
listen
well
to
this

Assassinate

be
assassinated

I
*NL*
care
very
little
about
that
!
I
do

him

Besides

he
is
an
*NL*
Englishman

But
do
not
touch
with
the
tip
of
your
finger
a
single
hair
*NL*
of
d'Artagnan
,
who
is
a
faithful
friend
whom
I
love
and
defend
,
or
I
*NL*
swear
to
you
by
the
head
of
my
father
the
crime
which
you
shall
have
*NL*
endeavored
to
commit
,

shall
have
committed

shall
be
the
last

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
has
cruelly
insulted
me

''
said
Milady
,
in
a
hollow
*NL*
tone
;
``
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
shall
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
Is
it
possible
to
insult
you

said
Athos
,
laughing
;
*NL*
``
he
has
insulted
you
,
and
he
shall
die

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
shall
die
!
''
replied
Milady
;
``
she
first
,
and
he
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
was
seized
with
a
kind
of
vertigo
.
The
sight
of
this
creature
,
who
*NL*
had
nothing
of
the
woman
about
her
,
recalled
awful
remembrances
.
He
*NL*
thought
how
one
day
,
in
a
less
dangerous
situation
than
the
one
in
which
*NL*
he
was
now
placed
,
he
had
already
endeavored
to
sacrifice
her
to
his
*NL*
honor
.
His
desire
for
blood
returned
,
burning
his
brain
and
pervading
*NL*
his
frame
like
a
raging
fever
;
he
arose
in
his
turn
,
reached
his
hand
to
*NL*
his
belt
,
drew
forth
a
pistol
,
and
cocked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
pale
as
a
corpse
,
endeavored
to
cry
out
;
but
her
swollen
tongue
*NL*
could
utter
no
more
than
a
hoarse
sound
which
had
nothing
human
in
it
*NL*
and
resembled
the
rattle
of
a
wild
beast
.
Motionless
against
the
dark
*NL*
tapestry
,
with
her
hair
in
disorder
,
she
appeared
like
a
horrid
image
of
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
slowly
raised
his
pistol
,
stretched
out
his
arm
so
that
the
weapon
*NL*
almost
touched
Milady
's
forehead
,
and
then
,
in
a
voice
the
more
terrible
*NL*
from
having
the
supreme
calmness
of
a
fixed
resolution
,
``
Madame
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
you
will
this
instant
deliver
to
me
the
paper
the
cardinal
signed
;
*NL*
or
upon
my
soul
,
I
will
blow
your
brains
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
another
man
,
Milady
might
have
preserved
some
doubt
;
but
she
knew
*NL*
Athos
.
Nevertheless
,
she
remained
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
one
second
to
decide
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
saw
by
the
contraction
of
his
countenance
that
the
trigger
was
*NL*
about
to
be
pulled
;
she
reached
her
hand
quickly
to
her
bosom
,
drew
out
*NL*
a
paper
,
and
held
it
toward
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
be
accursed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
the
paper
,
returned
the
pistol
to
his
belt
,
approached
the
*NL*
lamp
to
be
assured
that
it
was
the
paper
,
unfolded
it
,
and
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dec.
3
,
1627
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
by
my
order
and
for
the
good
of
the
state
that
the
bearer
of
this
*NL*

done
what
he
has
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
RICHELIEU
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Athos
,
resuming
his
cloak
and
putting
on
his
hat
,
``
now
*NL*
that
I
have
drawn
your
teeth
,
viper
,
bite
if
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
left
the
chamber
without
once
looking
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
he
found
the
two
men
and
the
spare
horse
which
they
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
Monseigneur
's
order
is
,
you
know
,
to
conduct
that
*NL*
woman
,
without
losing
time
,
to
Fort
La
Pointe
,
and
never
to
leave
her
*NL*
till
she
is
on
board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
words
agreed
wholly
with
the
order
they
had
received
,
they
*NL*
bowed
their
heads
in
sign
of
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
Athos
,
he
leaped
lightly
into
the
saddle
and
set
out
at
*NL*
full
gallop
;
only
instead
of
following
the
road
,
he
went
across
the
*NL*
fields
,
urging
his
horse
to
the
utmost
and
stopping
occasionally
to
*NL*
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
those
halts
he
heard
the
steps
of
several
horses
on
the
road
.
*NL*
He
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
cardinal
and
his
escort
.
He
immediately
made
*NL*
a
new
point
in
advance
,
rubbed
his
horse
down
with
some
heath
and
leaves
*NL*
of
trees
,
and
placed
himself
across
the
road
,
about
two
hundred
paces
*NL*
from
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
cried
he
,
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
horsemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
our
brave
Musketeer
,
I
think
,
''
said
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
it
is
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Athos
,
''
said
Richelieu
,
``
receive
my
thanks
for
the
good
guard
*NL*
you
have
kept

Gentlemen
,
we
are
arrived
;
take
the
gate
on
the
left
.
The
*NL*
watchword
is
,
`
King
and
Re
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
these
words
,
the
cardinal
saluted
the
three
friends
with
an
*NL*
inclination
of
his
head
,
and
took
the
right
hand
,
followed
by
his
*NL*
attendant
--
for
that
night
he
himself
slept
in
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Porthos
and
Aramis
together
,
as
soon
as
the
cardinal
was
*NL*
out
of
hearing
,
``
well
,
he
signed
the
paper
she
required
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
''
said
Athos
,
coolly
,
``
since
here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
three
friends
did
not
exchange
another
word
till
they
reached
*NL*
their
quarters
,
except
to
give
the
watchword
to
the
sentinels
.
Only
they
*NL*
sent
Mousqueton
to
tell
Planchet
that
his
master
was
requested
,
the
*NL*
instant
that
he
left
the
trenches
,
to
come
to
the
quarters
of
the
*NL*
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
as
Athos
had
foreseen
,
on
finding
the
two
men
that
awaited
her
,
*NL*
made
no
difficulty
in
following
them
.
She
had
had
for
an
instant
an
*NL*
inclination
to
be
reconducted
to
the
cardinal
,
and
relate
everything
to
*NL*
him
;
but
a
revelation
on
her
part
would
bring
about
a
revelation
on
the
*NL*
part
of
Athos
.
She
might
say
that
Athos
had
hanged
her
;
but
then
Athos
*NL*
would
tell
that
she
was
branded
.
She
thought
it
was
best
to
preserve
*NL*
silence
,
to
discreetly
set
off
to
accomplish
her
difficult
mission
with
*NL*
her
usual
skill
;
and
then
,
all
things
being
accomplished
to
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
cardinal
,
to
come
to
him
and
claim
her
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
,
after
having
traveled
all
night
,
at
seven
o'clock
she
*NL*
was
at
the
fort
of
the
Point
;
at
eight
o'clock
she
had
embarked
;
and
at
*NL*
nine
,
the
vessel
,
which
with
letters
of
marque
from
the
cardinal
was
*NL*
supposed
to
be
sailing
for
Bayonne
,
raised
anchor
,
and
steered
its
*NL*
course
toward
England
.

THE
BASTION

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
lodgings
of
his
three
friends
,
d'Artagnan
found
them
*NL*
assembled
in
the
same
chamber
.
Athos
was
meditating
;
Porthos
was
*NL*
twisting
his
mustache
;
Aramis
was
saying
his
prayers
in
a
charming
*NL*
little
Book
of
Hours
,
bound
in
blue
velvet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu

gentlemen

said
he
.
``
I
hope
what
you
have
to
tell
me
is
worth

the
trouble

or
else
,
I
warn
you

I
will
not
pardon
you
for
making
me
*NL*
come
here
instead
of
getting
a
little
rest
after
a
night
spent
in
taking
*NL*
and
dismantling
a
bastion
.
Ah
,
why
were
you
not
there
,
gentlemen
?
It
was
*NL*
warm
work

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
in
a
place

it
was
not
very
cold

replied
Porthos
,
giving
*NL*
his
mustache
a
twist
which
was
peculiar
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!

said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
!

said
d'Artagnan
,
comprehending
the
slight
frown
of
the
*NL*
Musketeer
.
``
It
appears
there
is
something
fresh
aboard
.

Yes

How
did
you
fare

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part

I
ate

little

The
day
before
yesterday

day

had
nothing

meat

*NL*
``
What

said
Athos
,
``
no
fish

``
They

said
Aramis
,
resuming
his
pious
reading
,
``
that
the
dyke
*NL*
which
the
cardinal
is
making
drives
them
all
out
into
the
open
sea

*NL*
``
But
that

not
quite
what
I
mean

ask

replied
Athos
.
*NL*
``
I
want
to

alone

nobody
interrupted
you

*NL*

Why

*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
was
accustomed
to
his
friend
's
manner
of
acting
,
and
who
*NL*
perceived
immediately
,
by
a
word
,
a
gesture
,
or
a
sign
from
him
,
that
*NL*
the
circumstances
were
serious
,
took
Athos
's
arm
,
and
went
out
without
*NL*
saying
anything

Porthos
followed
,
chatting
with
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
way
they
met
Grimaud

Athos
made
him
a
sign
to
come
with
them

Grimaud

according

obeyed

*NL*
They
arrived
at
the
drinking
room
of
the
Parpaillot
.
It
was
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
daylight
began
to
appear
.
The
three
friends
*NL*
ordered
breakfast
,
and
went
into
a
room
in
which
the
host
said
they
*NL*
would
not
be
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
the
hour
was
badly
chosen
for
a
private
conference
.
The
*NL*
morning
drum
had
just
been
beaten
;
everyone
shook
off
the
drowsiness
of
*NL*
night
,
and
to
dispel
the
humid
morning
air
,
came
to
take
a
drop
at
the
*NL*
inn
.
Dragoons
,
Swiss
,
Guardsmen
,
Musketeers
,
light-horsemen
,
succeeded
*NL*
one
another
with
a
rapidity
which
might
answer
the
purpose
of
the
host
*NL*
very
well
,
but
agreed
badly
with
the
views
of
the
four
friends
.
Thus
*NL*
they
applied
very
curtly
to
the
salutations
,
healths
,
and
jokes
of
their
*NL*
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
how
it
will
be
,
''
said
Athos
:
``
we
shall
get
into
some
pretty
*NL*
quarrel
or
other
,
and
we
have
no
need
of
one
just
now
.
D'Artagnan
,
tell
*NL*
us
what
sort
of
a
night
you
have
had
,
and
we
will
describe
ours
*NL*
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
a
light-horseman
,
with
a
glass
of
brandy
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
which
he
sipped
slowly
.
``
I
hear
you
gentlemen
of
the
Guards
have
been
in
*NL*
the
trenches
tonight
,
and
that
you
did
not
get
much
the
best
of
the
*NL*
Rochellais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
looked
at
Athos
to
know
if
he
ought
to
reply
to
this
intruder
*NL*
who
thus
mixed
unasked
in
their
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
do
n't
you
hear
Monsieur
de
Busigny
,
who
does
you
*NL*
the
honor
to
ask
you
a
question
?
Relate
what
has
passed
during
the
*NL*
night
,
since
these
gentlemen
desire
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
not
taken
a
bastion
?
''
said
a
Swiss
,
who
was
drinking
rum
out
*NL*
of
a
beer
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monsieur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
bowing
,
``
we
have
had
that
honor
.
We
*NL*
even
have
,
as
you
may
have
heard
,
introduced
a
barrel
of
powder
under
*NL*
one
of
the
angles
,
which
in
blowing
up
made
a
very
pretty
breach
.
*NL*
Without
reckoning
that
as
the
bastion
was
not
built
yesterday
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
building
was
badly
shaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
bastion
is
it
?
''
asked
a
dragoon
,
with
his
saber
run
through
a
*NL*
goose
which
he
was
taking
to
be
cooked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bastion
St.
Gervais
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
from
behind
which
the
*NL*
Rochellais
annoyed
our
workmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
affair
hot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
moderately
so
.
We
lost
five
men
,
and
the
Rochellais
eight
or
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Balzempleu
!
''
said
the
Swiss
,
who
,
notwithstanding
the
admirable
*NL*
collection
of
oaths
possessed
by
the
German
language
,
had
acquired
a
*NL*
habit
of
swearing
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
probable
,
''
said
the
light-horseman
,
``
that
they
will
send
*NL*
pioneers
this
morning
to
repair
the
bastion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
probable
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
a
wager
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
wooi
,
a
vager
!
''
cried
the
Swiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
the
light-horseman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
bit
,
''
said
the
dragoon
,
placing
his
saber
like
a
spit
upon
the
*NL*
two
large
iron
dogs
which
held
the
firebrands
in
the
chimney
,
``
stop
a
*NL*
bit
,
I
am
in
it
.
You
cursed
host
!
a
dripping
pan
immediately
,
that
I
may
*NL*
not
lose
a
drop
of
the
fat
of
this
estimable
bird
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
was
right
,
''
said
the
Swiss
;
``
goose
grease
is
kood
with
basdry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
the
dragoon
.
``
Now
for
the
wager
!
We
listen
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
wager
!
''
said
the
light-horseman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Monsieur
de
Busigny
,
I
will
bet
you
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
that
my
three
*NL*
companions
,
Messieurs
Porthos
,
Aramis
,
and
d'Artagnan
,
and
myself
,
will
*NL*
go
and
breakfast
in
the
bastion
St.
Gervais
,
and
we
will
remain
there
an
*NL*
hour
,
by
the
watch
,
whatever
the
enemy
may
do
to
dislodge
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
looked
at
each
other
;
they
began
to
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
in
the
ear
of
Athos
,
``
you
are
going
to
get
us
*NL*
all
killed
without
mercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
much
more
likely
to
be
killed
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
if
we
do
not
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Porthos
,
turning
round
upon
his
chair
and
*NL*
twisting
his
mustache
,
``
that
's
a
fair
bet
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
it
,
''
said
M.
de
Busigny
;
``
so
let
us
fix
the
stake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
four
gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
and
we
are
four
;
an
unlimited
*NL*
dinner
for
eight
.
Will
that
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capitally
,
''
replied
M.
de
Busigny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
''
said
the
dragoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shoots
me
,
''
said
the
Swiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fourth
auditor
,
who
during
all
this
conversation
had
played
a
mute
*NL*
part
,
made
a
sign
of
the
head
in
proof
that
he
acquiesced
in
the
*NL*
proposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
breakfast
for
these
gentlemen
is
ready
,
''
said
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
bring
it
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
obeyed
.
Athos
called
Grimaud
,
pointed
to
a
large
basket
which
*NL*
lay
in
a
corner
,
and
made
a
sign
to
him
to
wrap
the
viands
up
in
the
*NL*
napkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
understood
that
it
was
to
be
a
breakfast
on
the
grass
,
took
the
*NL*
basket
,
packed
up
the
viands
,
added
the
bottles
,
and
then
took
the
*NL*
basket
on
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
are
you
going
to
eat
my
breakfast
?
''
asked
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
matter
,
if
you
are
paid
for
it
?
''
said
Athos
,
and
he
threw
two
*NL*
pistoles
majestically
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
give
you
the
change
,
my
officer
?
''
said
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
only
add
two
bottles
of
champagne
,
and
the
difference
will
be
for
*NL*
the
napkins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
had
not
quite
so
good
a
bargain
as
he
at
first
hoped
for
,
but
*NL*
he
made
amends
by
slipping
in
two
bottles
of
Anjou
wine
instead
of
two
*NL*
bottles
of
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Busigny
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
set
your
*NL*
watch
with
mine
,
or
permit
me
to
regulate
mine
by
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
you
please
,
monsieur
!
''
said
the
light-horseman
,
drawing
from
his
*NL*
fob
a
very
handsome
watch
,
studded
with
diamonds
;
``
half
past
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-five
minutes
after
seven
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
by
which
you
perceive
I
*NL*
am
five
minutes
faster
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
bowing
to
all
the
astonished
persons
present
,
the
young
men
took
the
*NL*
road
to
the
bastion
St.
Gervais
,
followed
by
Grimaud
,
who
carried
the
*NL*
basket
,
ignorant
of
where
he
was
going
but
in
the
passive
obedience
*NL*
which
Athos
had
taught
him
not
even
thinking
of
asking
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
they
were
within
the
circle
of
the
camp
,
the
four
friends
did
*NL*
not
exchange
one
word
;
besides
,
they
were
followed
by
the
curious
,
who
,
*NL*
hearing
of
the
wager
,
were
anxious
to
know
how
they
would
come
out
of
*NL*
it
.
But
when
once
they
passed
the
line
of
circumvallation
and
found
*NL*
themselves
in
the
open
plain
,
d'Artagnan
,
who
was
completely
ignorant
of
*NL*
what
was
going
forward
,
thought
it
was
time
to
demand
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
my
dear
Athos
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
me
the
kindness
to
tell
me
where
*NL*
we
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
plainly
enough
we
are
going
to
the
bastion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
we
going
to
do
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
well
that
we
go
to
breakfast
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
we
not
breakfast
at
the
Parpaillot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
we
have
very
important
matters
to
communicate
to
one
another
,
*NL*
and
it
was
impossible
to
talk
five
minutes
in
that
inn
without
being
*NL*
annoyed
by
all
those
importunate
fellows
,
who
keep
coming
in
,
saluting
*NL*
you
,
and
addressing
you
.
Here
at
least
,
''
said
Athos
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
bastion
,
``
they
will
not
come
and
disturb
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
to
me
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
with
that
prudence
which
allied
*NL*
itself
in
him
so
naturally
with
excessive
bravery
,
``
that
we
could
have
*NL*
found
some
retired
place
on
the
downs
or
the
seashore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
we
should
have
been
seen
all
four
conferring
together
,
so
that
at
*NL*
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
cardinal
would
have
been
informed
by
*NL*
his
spies
that
we
were
holding
a
council
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
Athos
is
right
:
ANIMADVERTUNTUR
IN
DESERTIS
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
desert
would
not
have
been
amiss
,
''
said
Porthos
;
``
but
it
behooved
us
*NL*
to
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
desert
where
a
bird
can
not
pass
over
one
's
head
,
where
a
*NL*
fish
can
not
leap
out
of
the
water
,
where
a
rabbit
can
not
come
out
of
its
*NL*
burrow
,
and
I
believe
that
bird
,
fish
,
and
rabbit
each
becomes
a
spy
of
*NL*
the
cardinal
.
Better
,
then
,
pursue
our
enterprise
;
from
which
,
besides
,
*NL*
we
can
not
retreat
without
shame
.
We
have
made
a
wager
--
a
wager
which
*NL*
could
not
have
been
foreseen
,
and
of
which
I
defy
anyone
to
divine
the
*NL*
true
cause

We
are
going
,
in
order
to
win
it
,
to
remain
an
hour
in
the
*NL*
bastion

Either
we
shall
be
attacked
,
or
not

If
we
are
not

we
shall

have
all
the
time
to
talk

nobody
will
hear
us

for
I
guarantee
the
*NL*
walls
of
the
bastion
have
no
ears
;
if
we
are
,
we
will
talk
of
our
*NL*
affairs
just
the
same
.
Moreover
,
in
defending
ourselves
,
we
shall
cover
*NL*
ourselves
with
glory
.
You
see
that
everything
is
to
our
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
we
shall
indubitably
attract
a
ball
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear

replied
Athos
,
``
you
know
well
that
the
balls
most
to
be
*NL*
dreaded
are
not
from
the
enemy

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
such
an
expedition
we

brought
our

You

Porthos

*NL*
``
I
do

``
Well

Athos

have
you
not

What
did

demanded
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan

*NL*
``
What
then

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
``
Well

instead

four
musketoons

we

charges
to
fire

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Aramis
,
``
truly
you
are
a
great
man

*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
nodded
in
sign
of
agreement

D'Artagnan
alone
did
not
seem
*NL*
convinced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
no
doubt
shared
the
misgivings
of
the
young
man
,
for
seeing
that
*NL*
they
continued
to
advance
toward
the
bastion
--
something
he
had
till
then
*NL*
doubted
--
he
pulled
his
master
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
going
?
''
asked
he
,
by
a
gesture

*NL*
*NL*
Athos
pointed
to
the
bastion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Grimaud
,
in
the
same
silent
dialect
,
``
we
shall
leave
our
*NL*
skins
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
raised
his
eyes
and
his
finger
toward
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
put
his
basket
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
with
a
shake
of
the
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
a
pistol
from
his
belt
,
looked
to
see
if
it
was
properly
*NL*
primed
,
cocked
it
,
and
placed
the
muzzle
close
to
Grimaud
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
was
on
his
legs
again
as
if
by
a
spring
.
Athos
then
made
him
a
*NL*
sign
to
take
up
his
basket
and
to
walk
on
first
.
Grimaud
obeyed
.
All
*NL*
that
Grimaud
gained
by
this
momentary
pantomime
was
to
pass
from
the
*NL*
rear
guard
to
the
vanguard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
bastion
,
the
four
friends
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
three
hundred
soldiers
of
all
kinds
were
assembled
at
the
gate
*NL*
of
the
camp
;
and
in
a
separate
group
might
be
distinguished
M.
de
*NL*
Busigny
,
the
dragoon
,
the
Swiss
,
and
the
fourth
bettor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
off
his
hat
,
placed
it
on
the
end
of
his
sword
,
and
waved
it
*NL*
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
spectators
returned
him
his
salute
,
accompanying
this
courtesy
*NL*
with
a
loud
hurrah
which
was
audible
to
the
four
;
after
which
all
four
*NL*
disappeared
in
the
bastion
,
whither
Grimaud
had
preceded
them
.

THE
COUNCIL
OF
THE
MUSKETEERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Athos
had
foreseen
,
the
bastion
was
only
occupied
by
a
dozen
corpses
,
*NL*
French
and
Rochellais
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
who
had
assumed
the
command
of
the
expedition
,
*NL*
``
while
Grimaud
spreads
the
table
,
let
us
begin
by
collecting
the
guns
*NL*
and
cartridges
together
.
We
can
talk
while
performing
that
necessary
*NL*
task
.
These
gentlemen
,
''
added
he
,
pointing
to
the
bodies
,
``
can
not
hear
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
could
throw
them
into
the
ditch
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
after
having
*NL*
assured
ourselves
they
have
nothing
in
their
pockets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
that
's
Grimaud
's
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
pray
let
Grimaud
search
them
and
throw
*NL*
them
over
the
walls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forfend
!
''
said
Athos
;
``
they
may
serve
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
bodies
serve
us
?
''
said
Porthos
.
``
You
are
mad
,
dear
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Judge
not
rashly
,
say
the
gospel

the
cardinal

replied
Athos
.
``
How
*NL*

guns

gentlemen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve

''
replied
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
shots
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
quite
as
many
as
we
shall
want

Let
us
load
the
guns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
Musketeers
went
to
work
;
and
as
they
were
loading
the
last
*NL*
musket
Grimaud
announced
that
the
breakfast
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
replied
,
always
by
gestures
,
that
that
was
well
,
and
indicated
to
*NL*
Grimaud
,
by
pointing
to
a
turret
that
resembled
a
pepper
caster
,
that
he
*NL*
was
to
stand
as
sentinel
.
Only
,
to
alleviate
the
tediousness
of
the
*NL*
duty
,
Athos
allowed
him
to
take
a
loaf
,
two
cutlets
,
and
a
bottle
of
*NL*
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
to
table
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
friends
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
with
their
legs
crossed
*NL*
like
Turks
,
or
even
tailors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
as
there
is
no
longer
any
fear
of
being
*NL*
overheard

I
hope
you
are
going
to
let
me
into
your
secret

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
at
the

procure
you
amusement

*NL*
said
Athos
.
``
I
have
induced
you
to
take
a
charming
promenade

here
is
a

delicious
breakfast

yonder
are
five
hundred
persons
,
as
you
may
see
*NL*
through
the
loopholes

taking
us
for
heroes

madmen

two

resembling

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
secret

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
secret
is

said
Athos
,
``
that
I
saw
Milady
last
night

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
lifting
a
glass
to
his
lips
;
but
at
the
name
of
Milady
,
*NL*
his
hand
trembled
so
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
put
the
glass
on
the
ground
*NL*
again
for
fear
of
spilling
the
contents
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw

wi

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

interrupted
Athos
.
``
You
forget

my
dear

you
forget

gentlemen
are
not
initiated

I
have
*NL*
seen
Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

demanded
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*

Within
two
leagues

inn

the
Red
Dovecot

*NL*
``
In

I
am
lost

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
bad
yet

''
replied
Athos
;
``
for
by
this
time
she
must
have
quit
*NL*
the
shores
of
France

*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
breathed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
,
''
asked
Porthos
,
``
who
is
Milady
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
charming
woman

said
Athos
,
sipping
a
glass
of
sparkling
wine
.
*NL*
``
Villainous
host
!

cried
he
,
``
he
has
given
us
Anjou
wine
instead

champagne

no
better

Yes

continued
he
,
``
a

charming

entertained
kind
views

on

part

has
given
her
some
offense

she
tried

revenge
herself
a
month
ago
by
having
him
killed
by
two
musket
shots
,
a
*NL*
week
ago
by
trying

poison
him

and
yesterday
by
demanding

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
by
demanding
my
head
of
the

cried
d'Artagnan

pale
*NL*
with
terror

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
is
true
as
the
Gospel

Porthos
;

I
heard
her
with

own
ears

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
also

Aramis

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

said
d'Artagnan
,
letting
his
arm
fall
with
discouragement
,
``
it
*NL*
is
useless
to
struggle

I
may
as
well
blow
my
brains
out

will
be
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

the
last
folly

committed

Athos

seeing
it

only
one

there
is
no
remedy

I

Considering

I
permit

Of

just

*NL*
``
Bah

God

*NL*
Then
,
swallowing
the
contents
of
his
glass
,
which
he
put
down
close
to
*NL*
him

Athos
arose
carelessly
,
took
the
musket
next
to
him

drew
near
*NL*
to
one
of
the
loopholes

*NL*
*NL*
Porthos

Aramis
and
d'Artagnan
followed
his
example

As
to
Grimaud
,
he
*NL*
received
orders
to
place
himself
behind
the
four
friends
in
order
to
*NL*
reload
their
weapons

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu

said
Athos

it
was
hardly
worth

to
distribute
*NL*
ourselves

twenty
fellows
armed

pickaxes

mattocks

*NL*
Grimaud
had
only
to
make
them
a
sign

go
away

I
am
convinced
they
*NL*
would
have
left
us
in
peace

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
that

replied
d'Artagnan

Besides

soldiers

a
brigadier

armed
with
muskets

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

*NL*
``
My

*NL*
``
He

Porthos

*NL*
``
In

d'Artagnan
,
``
you
will

shot

*NL*

But
Athos
heeded
not
his
advice

Mounting
on
the
breach
,
with
his
musket
*NL*
in
one
hand
and
his
hat
in
the
other
,
he
said
,
bowing
courteously
and
*NL*
addressing
the
soldiers
and
the
pioneers
,
who
,
astonished
at
this
*NL*
apparition
,
stopped
fifty
paces
from
the
bastion
:
``
Gentlemen

a
few
*NL*
friends

myself
are
about

breakfast

Now

you
know

nothing
is
more
disagreeable
than
being
disturbed
when
one
is
at
*NL*
breakfast

We
request
you
,
then
,
if
you
really
have
business
here
,
to
*NL*
wait
till
we
have
finished
our
repast
,
or
to
come
again
a
short
time
*NL*
hence
;
unless
,
which
would
be
far
better
,
you
form
the
salutary
*NL*
resolution
to
quit
the
side
of
the
rebels
,
and
come
and
drink
with
us
to
*NL*
the
health

the
King
of
France

*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care

Athos

cried
d'Artagnan
;
``
do
n't
you
see
they
are
aiming

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

said
Athos
;

but
they
are
only
civilians

very
bad
marksmen

who
will
be
sure
not
to
hit
me

*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
at
the
same
instant
four
shots
were
fired
,
and
the
balls
were
*NL*
flattened
against
the
wall
around
Athos
,
but
not
one
touched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
shots
replied
to
them
almost
instantaneously
,
but
much
better
aimed
*NL*
than
those
of
the
aggressors
;
three
soldiers
fell
dead
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
pioneers
was
wounded

*NL*
*NL*
``
Grimaud

said
Athos
,
still
on
the
breach
,
``
another
musket

*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
immediately
obeyed
.
On
their
part
,
the
three
friends
had
*NL*
reloaded
their
arms
;
a
second
discharge
followed
the
first
.
The
*NL*
brigadier
and
two
pioneers
fell
dead
;
the
rest
of
the
troop
took
to
*NL*
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
a
sortie
!

cried
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
four
friends
rushed
out
of
the
fort
,
gained
the
field
of
battle
,
*NL*
picked
up
the
four
muskets
of
the
privates
and
the
half-pike
of
the
*NL*
brigadier
,
and
convinced
that
the
fugitives
would
not
stop
till
they
*NL*
reached
the
city
,
turned
again
toward
the
bastion
,
bearing
with
them
the
*NL*
trophies
of
their
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reload
the
muskets

said
Athos

we

go

on

resume

conversation

*NL*
``

recollect

followed

goes
into

*NL*
D'Artagnan
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise

indignation

*NL*
``
But
this
is
infamous

he

As

Athos

beg
you

take
our
brigadier

half-pike

*NL*
tie
a
napkin
to
it

and
plant
it
on

of
our
bastion

these

rebels

Rochellais
may
see

deal
with
brave

*NL*
Grimaud
obeyed
without
replying

An

afterward

white
flag

was
floating
over
the
heads
of
the
four
friends
.
A
thunder
of
applause
*NL*
saluted
its
appearance
;
half
the
camp
was
at
the
barrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
you
care
little
if
she
kills
Buckingham
or
*NL*
causes
him
to
be
killed
?
But
the
duke
is
our
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
duke
is
English
;
the
duke
fights
against
us
.
Let
her
do
what
she
*NL*
likes
with
the
duke
;
I
care
no
more
about
him
than
an
empty
bottle
.
''
And
*NL*
Athos
threw
fifteen
paces
from
him
an
empty
bottle
from
which
he
had
*NL*
poured
the
last
drop
into
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moment
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
will
not
abandon
Buckingham
thus
.
He
*NL*
gave
us
some
very
fine
horses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
moreover
,
very
handsome
saddles
,
''
said
Porthos
,
who
at
the
moment
*NL*
wore
on
his
cloak
the
lace
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
God
desires
the
conversion
and
not
the
death
of
*NL*
a
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
said
Athos
,
``
and
we
will
return
to
that
subject
later
,
if
such
*NL*
be
your
pleasure
;
but
what
for
the
moment
engaged
my
attention
most
*NL*
earnestly
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
understand
me
,
d'Artagnan
,
was
the
*NL*
getting
from
this
woman
a
kind
of
carte
blanche
which
she
had
extorted
*NL*
from
the
cardinal
,
and
by
means
of
which
she
could
with
impunity
get
rid
*NL*
of
you
and
perhaps
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
creature
must
be
a
demon
!
''
said
Porthos
,
holding
out
his
plate
*NL*
to
Aramis
,
who
was
cutting
up
a
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
carte
blanche
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
this
carte
blanche
,
does
it
*NL*
remain
in
her
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
passed
into
mine
;
I
will
not
say
without
trouble
,
for
if
I
did
I
*NL*
should
tell
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Athos
,
I
shall
no
longer
count
the
number
of
times
I
am
*NL*
indebted
to
you
for
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
was
to
go
to
her
that
you
left
us
?
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
that
letter
of
the
cardinal
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
said
Athos
;
and
he
took
the
invaluable
paper
from
the
*NL*
pocket
of
his
uniform
.
D'Artagnan
unfolded
it
with
one
hand
,
whose
*NL*
trembling
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
conceal
,
to
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dec.
3

It
is
by
my
order

for
the

he
has
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
RICHELIEU

*NL*
*NL*

In
fact

Aramis
,
``
it
is
an
absolution

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
paper
must
be
torn
to
pieces

said
d'Artagnan
,
who
fancied
he
*NL*
read
in
it
his
sentence
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,

said
Athos
,
``
it
must
be
preserved
carefully

I
would

not

up
this
paper

covered

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
she
do
now
?

asked
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
replied
Athos
,
carelessly
,
``
she
is
probably
going
to
write
to
the
*NL*
cardinal
that
a
damned
Musketeer

named
Athos

has
taken
her
*NL*
safe-conduct
from
her
by
force

she
will
advise
him
in
the
same
letter
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
his
two
friends

Aramis

Porthos
,
at
the

The
*NL*
cardinal
will
remember
that
these
are
the
same
men
who
have
often
*NL*
crossed
his
path
;
and
then
some
fine
morning
he
will
arrest
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
and
for
fear
he
should
feel
lonely
,
he
will
send
us
to
keep
him
company
*NL*
in
the
Bastille
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
!
It
appears
to
me
you
make
dull
jokes

my
dear

said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not

Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know

''
said
Porthos
,
``
that
to
twist
that
damned
Milady

neck

be
a
smaller
sin

poor
devils

Huguenots
,
who
have
committed
no
other
crime
than
singing
in

psalms

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
says
the
abbe

asked
Athos

quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
I
am

of

opinion

replied
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
too
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
,
she
is
far
off

said
Porthos
,
``
for
I
confess
she
would

worry
me
if

here

*NL*
*NL*

me
in
England

*NL*
*NL*

She
worries
me
everywhere
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
you
held
her
in
your
power

why
did
you
not
drown
her

*NL*
strangle

her
?
''
said
Porthos
.
``
It
is
only
the
dead
who
do
not
*NL*
return

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
so
,
Porthos
?
''
replied
the
Musketeer
,
with
a
sad
smile
which
*NL*
d'Artagnan
alone
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
idea
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
the
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
arms
!
''
cried
Grimaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
sprang
up
,
and
seized
their
muskets
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
a
small
troop
advanced
,
consisting
of
from
twenty
to
*NL*
twenty-five
men
;
but
they
were
not
pioneers
,
they
were
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
garrison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
return
to
the
camp
?
''
said
Porthos
.
``
I
do
n't
think
the
sides
*NL*
are
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
,
for
three
reasons
,
''
replied
Athos
.
``
The
first
,
that
we
have
*NL*
not
finished
breakfast
;
the
second
,
that
we
still
have
some
very
*NL*
important
things
to
say
;
and
the
third
,
that
it
yet
wants
ten
minutes
*NL*
before
the
lapse
of
the
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
we
must
form
a
plan
of
battle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
simple
,
''
replied
Athos
.
``
As
soon
as
the
enemy
are
within
*NL*
musket
shot
,
we
must
fire
upon
them
.
If
they
continue
to
advance
,
we
*NL*
must
fire
again
.
We
must
fire
as
long
as
we
have
loaded
guns
.
If
those
*NL*
who
remain
of
the
troop
persist
in
coming
to
the
assault
,
we
will
allow
*NL*
the
besiegers
to
get
as
far
as
the
ditch
,
and
then
we
will
push
down
*NL*
upon
their
heads
that
strip
of
wall
which
keeps
its
perpendicular
by
a
*NL*
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
cried
Porthos
.
``
Decidedly
,
Athos
,
you
were
born
to
be
a
*NL*
general
,
and
the
cardinal
,
who
fancies
himself
a
great
soldier
,
is
*NL*
nothing
beside
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
no
divided
attention
,
I
beg
;
let
each
one
pick
*NL*
out
his
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
cover
mine
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
mine
,
''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
mine
,
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
,
then
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
muskets
made
but
one
report
,
but
four
men
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drum
immediately
beat
,
and
the
little
troop
advanced
at
charging
*NL*
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
shots
were
repeated
without
regularity
,
but
always
aimed
with
*NL*
the
same
accuracy
.
Nevertheless
,
as
if
they
had
been
aware
of
the
*NL*
numerical
weakness
of
the
friends
,
the
Rochellais
continued
to
advance
*NL*
in
quick
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
every
three
shots
at
least
two
men
fell
;
but
the
march
of
those
who
*NL*
remained
was
not
slackened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
bastion
,
there
were
still
more
than
a
dozen
*NL*
of
the
enemy
.
A
last
discharge
welcomed
them
,
but
did
not
stop
them
;
*NL*
they
jumped
into
the
ditch
,
and
prepared
to
scale
the
breach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
friends
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
finish
them
at
a
blow
.
To
the
wall
;
to
*NL*
the
wall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
four
friends
,
seconded
by
Grimaud
,
pushed
with
the
barrels
of
*NL*
their
muskets
an
enormous
sheet
of
the
wall
,
which
bent
as
if
pushed
by
*NL*
the
wind
,
and
detaching
itself
from
its
base
,
fell
with
a
horrible
crash
*NL*
into
the
ditch
.
Then
a
fearful
crash
was
heard
;
a
cloud
of
dust
mounted
*NL*
toward
the
sky
--
and
all
was
over
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
we
have
destroyed
them
all
,
from
the
first
to
the
last
?
''
said
*NL*
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
it
appears
so
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
cried
Porthos
;
``
there
go
three
or
four
,
limping
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
three
or
four
of
these
unfortunate
men
,
covered
with
dirt
and
*NL*
blood
,
fled
along
the
hollow
way
,
and
at
length
regained
the
city
.
These
*NL*
were
all
who
were
left
of
the
little
troop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
looked
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
have
been
here
an
hour
,
and
our
wager
is
won
;
*NL*
but
we
will
be
fair
players

Besides
,
d'Artagnan
has
not
told
us
his
*NL*
idea
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
Musketeer
,
with
his
usual
coolness
,
reseated
himself
before
the
*NL*
remains
of
the
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
idea
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
said
you
had
an
idea

''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
remember
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Well
,
I
will
go
to
England
a
second
*NL*
time
;
I
will
go
and
find
Buckingham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
not
do
that

d'Artagnan

said
Athos
,
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
?
Have
I
not
been
there
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
at
that
period
we
were
not
at
war
.
At
that
period
Buckingham
*NL*
was
an
ally
,
and
not
an
enemy
.
What
you
would
now
do
amounts
to
*NL*
treason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
perceived
the
force
of
this
reasoning
,
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
Porthos
,
``
I
think
I
have
an
idea

in
my
turn

*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

's
idea

said
Aramis

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
ask
leave
of
absence
of
Monsieur
de
Treville

on
some
pretext
or
*NL*
other
which
you
must
invent
;
I
am
not
very
clever
at
pretexts

Milady
*NL*
does
not
know
me

I
will
get
access
to
her
without
her
suspecting
me

*NL*
and
when
I
catch
my
beauty

I
will
strangle
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

replied
Athos
,
``
I
am
not

from
approving
the
idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

said
Aramis

Kill

the
*NL*
true

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
your

Athos
,
who
felt
much
deference
for
*NL*
the
young
Musketeer

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
inform
the
queen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my

yes

Porthos
and
d'Artagnan

at
the

we

are
coming
nearer
to
it
now

Athos
;

and
how

being
known
in
the
*NL*
camp

From
here
to
Paris
it
is
a
hundred
and
forty
leagues
;
before
our
*NL*
letter
was
at
Angers
we
should
be
in

dungeon

As

Aramis
stopped
on
seeing
Athos
smile

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

not

said
d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*

I
do
not

said
Athos

I
wish

*NL*
*NL*
``
Without

what
's
going
on
in

yonder

Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
beating
the
general
alarm

*NL*
*NL*
The
four
friends
listened
,
and
the
sound
of
the
drum
plainly
reached
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
they
are
going
to
send
a
whole
regiment
against
us

Athos

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

think
of
holding
out
against

do
you
?

said
*NL*
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
the
Musketeer
.
``
I
feel
myself
quite
in
a
humor
for
it
;
*NL*
and
I
would
hold
out
before
an
army
if
we
had
taken
the
precaution
to
*NL*
bring
a
dozen
more
bottles
of
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
the
drum
draws
near
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
come
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
It
is
a
quarter
of
an
hour

journey
from

here
to
the
city

consequently
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
journey
from
the
*NL*
city
to
hither

That
is
more
than
time
enough
for
us
to
devise
a
plan

*NL*
If
we
go
from
this
place
we
shall
never
find
another

suitable

Allow

The
four
friends
looked
at
one
another

a
cloud
came
over
the
brows
*NL*
which

lately
had
been
so
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out

cried
d'Artagnan

I
see
black
points

yonder

Why

It

Ah

ah

you
finished

*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
,
and
pointed
to
a
dozen
bodies
*NL*
which
he
had
set
up
in
the
most
picturesque
attitudes
.
Some
carried
*NL*
arms
,
others
seemed
to
be
taking
aim
,
and
the
remainder
appeared
merely
*NL*
to
be
sword
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

Athos

that

Ah

ah

Aramis

we
have
no
time

lose
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Athos
,

I
have
nothing

upon

hour

hour

a
half

Nothing

off

be
off

*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
was
already
ahead

with
the
basket

the
dessert

The
four

friends
followed

ten
paces
behind
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the

shall
we
do
now

gentlemen

Athos

*NL*

Have
you
forgotten
anything
?

said
Aramis

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
white
flag

morbleu

We
must
not
leave
a
flag
in
the
hands

the
*NL*
enemy

even
if
that
flag
be
but
a
napkin

*NL*
*NL*
And
Athos
ran
back
to
the
bastion
,
mounted
the
platform
,
and
bore
off
*NL*
the
flag
;
but
as
the
Rochellais
had
arrived
within
musket
range
,
they
*NL*
opened
a
terrible
fire
upon
this
man
,
who
appeared
to
expose
himself
for
*NL*
pleasure
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Athos
might
be
said
to
bear
a
charmed
life
.
The
balls
passed
and
*NL*
whistled
all
around
him
;
not
one
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
waved
his
flag
,
turning
his
back
on
the
guards
of
the
city
,
and
*NL*
saluting
those
of
the
camp
.
On
both
sides
loud
cries
arose
--
on
the
one
*NL*
side
cries
of
anger
,
on
the
other
cries
of
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
discharge
followed
the
first
,
and
three
balls
,
by
passing
*NL*
through
it
,
made
the
napkin
really
a
flag
.
Cries
were
heard
from
the
*NL*
camp
,
``
Come
down
!
come
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
came
down
;
his
friends
,
who
anxiously
awaited
him
,
saw
him
*NL*
returned
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
Athos
,
come
along
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
;
``
now
we
have
found
*NL*
everything
except
money
,
it
would
be
stupid
to
be
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Athos
continued
to
march
majestically
,
whatever
remarks
his
*NL*
companions
made
;
and
they
,
finding
their
remarks
useless
,
regulated
*NL*
their
pace
by
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
and
his
basket
were
far
in
advance
,
out
of
the
range
of
the
*NL*
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
an
instant
they
heard
a
furious
fusillade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
asked
Porthos
,
``
what
are
they
firing
at
now
?
I
hear
no
*NL*
balls
whistle
,
and
I
see
nobody
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
firing
at
the
corpses
,
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
dead
can
not
return
their
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
!
They
will
then
fancy
it
is
an
ambuscade
,
they
will
*NL*
deliberate
;
and
by
the
time
they
have
found
out
the
pleasantry
,
we
shall
*NL*
be
out
of
the
range
of
their
balls
.
That
renders
it
useless
to
get
a
*NL*
pleurisy
by
too
much
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
comprehend
now
,
''
said
the
astonished
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
lucky
,
''
said
Athos
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
part
,
the
French
,
on
seeing
the
four
friends
return
at
such
a
*NL*
step
,
uttered
cries
of
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
a
fresh
discharge
was
heard
,
and
this
time
the
balls
came
*NL*
rattling
among
the
stones
around
the
four
friends
,
and
whistling
sharply
*NL*
in
their
ears
.
The
Rochellais
had
at
last
taken
possession
of
the
*NL*
bastion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
Rochellais
are
bungling
fellows
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
how
many
have
we
*NL*
killed
of
them
--
a
dozen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
fifteen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
did
we
crush

wall

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight

ten

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
exchange
for
all
that
not
even
a
scratch

Ah
,
but
what
is
the
*NL*
matter
with
your
hand
,
d'Artagnan
?
It
bleeds
,
seemingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
spent
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
said
that
Athos
loved
d'Artagnan
like
a
child
,
and
this
somber
*NL*
and
inflexible
personage
felt
the
anxiety
of
a
parent
for
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
grazed
a
little
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
my
fingers
were
caught
*NL*
between
two
stones
--
that
of
the
wall

that
of
my
ring

the
skin
*NL*
was
broken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
comes
of
wearing
diamonds

Athos
,
disdainfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

to
be
sure

cried
Porthos
,
``
there
is
a
diamond

Why
the

do
we
plague
ourselves
about

is
a
diamond

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a

Aramis

an
idea

*NL*

Porthos

drawing
himself
up
at
Athos

compliment

there
is
a
diamond

sell
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
it
is
the
queen
's
diamond

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stronger
reason
why
it
should
be
sold

Athos

Buckingham

sell

What
says
Monsieur
the
Abbe
?
I
do
n't
ask
Porthos
;
his
opinion
has
been
*NL*
given

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
think
,
''
said
Aramis
,
blushing
as
usual
,
``
that
his
ring
not
*NL*
coming
from
a
mistress

and
consequently
not
being
a
love
token

*NL*
d'Artagnan
may
sell
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Aramis

you
speak

To

no

*NL*
*NL*
The
fusillade
continued
;
but
the
four
friends
were
out
of
reach
,
and
the
*NL*
Rochellais
only
fired
to
appease
their
consciences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

it

,
the
whole
camp
was
in
motion
.
More
than
two
*NL*
thousand
persons
had
assisted
,
as
at
a
spectacle
,
in
this
fortunate
but
*NL*
wild
undertaking
of
the
four
friends
--
an
undertaking
of
which
they
were
*NL*
far
from
suspecting
the
real
motive
.
Nothing
was
heard
but
cries
of
*NL*
``
Live
the
Musketeers
!
Live
the
Guards
!
''
M.
de
Busigny
was
the
first
to
*NL*
come
and
shake
Athos
by
the
hand
,
and
acknowledge
that
the
wager
was
*NL*
lost
.
The
dragoon
and
the
Swiss
followed
him
,
and
all
their
comrades
*NL*
followed
the
dragoon
and
the
Swiss
.
There
was
nothing
but
felicitations
,
*NL*
pressures
of
the
hand
,
and
embraces
;
there
was
no
end
to
the
*NL*
inextinguishable
laughter
at
the
Rochellais
.
The
tumult
at
length
became
*NL*
so
great
that
the
cardinal
fancied
there
must
be
some
riot
,
and
sent
La
*NL*
Houdiniere
,
his
captain
of
the
Guards
,
to
inquire
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
was
described
to
the
messenger
with
all
the
effervescence
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
the
cardinal
,
on
seeing
La
Houdiniere
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
monseigneur
,
''
replied
the
latter
,
``
three
Musketeers
and
a
*NL*
Guardsman
laid
a
wager
with
Monsieur
de
Busigny
that
they
would
go
and
*NL*
breakfast
in
the
bastion
St.
Gervais
;
and
while
breakfasting
they
held
*NL*
it
for
two
hours
against
the
enemy
,
and
have
killed
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
many
Rochellais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
inquire
the
names
of
those
three
Musketeers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
their
names
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messieurs
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
my
three
brave
fellows
!
''
murmured
the
cardinal
.
``
And
the
*NL*
Guardsman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
my
young
scapegrace

Positively
,
these
four
men
must
be
on
my
*NL*
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
the
cardinal
spoke
to
M.
de
Treville
of
the
exploit
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
which
was
the
talk
of
the
whole
camp
.
M.
de
Treville
,
who
*NL*
had
received
the
account
of
the
adventure
from
the
mouths
of
the
heroes
*NL*
of
it
,
related
it
in
all
its
details
to
his
Eminence
,
not
forgetting
the
*NL*
episode
of
the
napkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
Monsieur
de
Treville
,
''
said
the
cardinal
;
``
pray
let
that
*NL*
napkin
be
sent
to
me
.
I
will
have
three
fleur-de-lis
embroidered
on
it
*NL*
in
gold
,
and
will
give
it
to
your
company
as
a
standard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
M.
de
Treville
,
``
that
will
be
unjust
to
the
*NL*
Guardsmen
.
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
is
not
with
me
;
he
serves
under
Monsieur
*NL*
Dessessart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
take
him
,
''
said
the
cardinal
;
``
when
four
men
are
so
much
*NL*
attached
to
one
another
,
it
is
only
fair
that
they
should
serve
in
the
*NL*
same
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
M.
de
Treville
announced
this
good
news
to
the
three
*NL*
Musketeers
and
d'Artagnan
,
inviting
all
four
to
breakfast
with
him
next
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
beside
himself
with
joy
.
We
know
that
the
dream
of
his
*NL*
life
had
been
to
become
a
Musketeer
.
The
three
friends
were
likewise
*NL*
greatly
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
Athos
,
``
you
had
a
triumphant
idea
!
As
you
*NL*
said
,
we
have
acquired
glory
,
and
were
enabled
to
carry
on
a
*NL*
conversation
of
the
highest
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
we
can
resume
now
without
anybody
suspecting
us
,
for
,
with
the
*NL*
help
of
God
,
we
shall
henceforth
pass
for
cardinalists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
d'Artagnan
went
to
present
his
respects
to
M.
Dessessart
,
*NL*
and
inform
him
of
his
promotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
Dessessart
,
who
esteemed
d'Artagnan
,
made
him
offers
of
help
,
as
this
*NL*
change
would
entail
expenses
for
equipment
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
refused
;
but
thinking
the
opportunity
a
good
one
,
he
begged
*NL*
him
to
have
the
diamond
he
put
into
his
hand
valued
,
as
he
wished
to
*NL*
turn
it
into
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
M.
Dessessart
's
valet
came
to
d'Artagnan
's
lodging
,
and
*NL*
gave
him
a
bag
containing
seven
thousand
livres
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
price
of
the
queen
's
diamond
.

A
FAMILY
AFFAIR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
had
invented
the
phrase
,
family
affair
.
A
family
affair
was
not
*NL*
subject
to
the
investigation
of
the
cardinal
;
a
family
affair
concerned
*NL*
nobody
.
People
might
employ
themselves
in
a
family
affair
before
all
the
*NL*
world
.
Therefore
Athos
had
invented
the
phrase
,
family
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
had
discovered
the
idea
,
the
lackeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
had
discovered
the
means
,
the
diamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
alone
had
discovered
nothing
--
he
,
ordinarily
the
most
*NL*
inventive
of
the
four
;
but
it
must
be
also
said
that
the
very
name
of
*NL*
Milady
paralyzed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
no
,
we
were
mistaken
;
he
had
discovered
a
purchaser
for
his
diamond
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breakfast
at
M.
de
Treville
's
was
as
gay
and
cheerful
as
possible
.
*NL*
D'Artagnan
already
wore
his
uniform
--
for
being
nearly
of
the
same
size
*NL*
as
Aramis
,
and
as
Aramis
was
so
liberally
paid
by
the
publisher
who
*NL*
purchased
his
poem
as
to
allow
him
to
buy
everything
double
,
he
sold
his
*NL*
friend
a
complete
outfit
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
would
have
been
at
the
height
of
his
wishes
if
he
had
not
*NL*
constantly
seen
Milady
like
a
dark
cloud
hovering
in
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
meet
again
in
the
*NL*
evening
at
Athos
's
lodging
,
and
there
finish
their
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
passed
the
day
in
exhibiting
his
Musketeer
's
uniform
in
every
*NL*
street
of
the
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
the
four
friends
met
.
There
only
*NL*
remained
three
things
to
decide
--
what
they
should
write
to
Milady
's
*NL*
brother
;
what
they
should
write
to
the
clever
person
at
Tours
;
and
which
*NL*
should
be
the
lackeys
to
carry
the
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
offered
his
own
.
Athos
talked
of
the
discretion
of
Grimaud
,
who
*NL*
never
spoke
a
word
but
when
his
master
unlocked
his
mouth
.
Porthos
*NL*
boasted
of
the
strength
of
Mousqueton
,
who
was
big
enough
to
thrash
four
*NL*
men
of
ordinary
size
.
Aramis
,
confiding
in
the
address
of
Bazin
,
made
a
*NL*
pompous
eulogium
on
his
candidate
.
Finally
,
d'Artagnan
had
entire
faith
*NL*
in
the
bravery
of
Planchet
,
and
reminded
them
of
the
manner
in
which
he
*NL*
had
conducted
himself
in
the
ticklish
affair
of
Boulogne
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
virtues
disputed
the
prize
for
a
length
of
time
,
and
gave
*NL*
birth
to
magnificent
speeches
which
we
do
not
repeat
here
for
fear
they
*NL*
should
be
deemed
too
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unfortunately
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
he
whom
we
send
must
possess
in
himself
*NL*
alone
the
four
qualities
united
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
such
a
lackey
to
be
found
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
be
found
!
''
cried
Athos
.
``
I
know
it
well
,
so
take
Grimaud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
Mousqueton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
Bazin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
Planchet
.
Planchet
is
brave
and
shrewd
;
they
are
two
qualities
out
*NL*
of
the
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
the
principal
question
is
not
to
know
which
*NL*
of
our
four
lackeys
is
the
most
discreet
,
the
most
strong
,
the
most
*NL*
clever
,
or
the
most
brave
;
the
principal
thing
is
to
know
which
loves
*NL*
money
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Aramis
says
is
very
sensible
,
''
replied
Athos
;
``
we
must
speculate
*NL*
upon
the
faults
of
people
,
and
not
upon
their
virtues
.
Monsieur
Abbe
,
*NL*
you
are
a
great
moralist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
for
we
not
only
require
to
be
well
served
in
*NL*
order
to
succeed
,
but
moreover
,
not
to
fail
;
for
in
case
of
failure
,
*NL*
heads
are
in
question
,
not
for
our
lackeys
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
lower
,
Aramis
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
wise
--
not
for
the
lackeys
,
''
resumed
Aramis
,
``
but
for
the
*NL*
master
--
for
the
masters
,
we
may
say
.
Are
our
lackeys
sufficiently
*NL*
devoted
to
us
to
risk
their
lives
for
us
?
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
I
would
almost
answer
for
Planchet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
friend
,
add
to
his
natural
devotedness
a
good
sum
of
*NL*
money
,
and
then
,
instead
of
answering
for
him
once
,
answer
for
him
*NL*
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
God
!
you
will
be
deceived
just
the
same
,
''
said
Athos
,
who
was
*NL*
an
optimist
when
things
were
concerned
,
and
a
pessimist
when
men
were
in
*NL*
question
.
``
They
will
promise
everything
for
the
sake
of
the
money
,
and
*NL*
on
the
road
fear
will
prevent
them
from
acting
.
Once
taken
,
they
will
be
*NL*
pressed
;
when
pressed
,
they
will
confess
everything
.
What
the
devil
!
we
*NL*
are
not
children
.
To
reach
England
''
--
Athos
lowered
his
voice
--
``
all
*NL*
France
,
covered
with
spies
and
creatures
of
the
cardinal
,
must
be
*NL*
crossed
.
A
passport
for
embarkation
must
be
obtained
;
and
the
party
must
*NL*
be
acquainted
with
English
in
order
to
ask
the
way
to
London
.
Really
,
I
*NL*
think
the
thing
very
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
who
was
anxious
the
matter
should
be
*NL*
accomplished
;
``
on
the
contrary
,
I
think
it
very
easy

It
would
be

no

doubt

parbleu

write

Lord
de
Winter
about
affairs

vast

importance

of
the
horrors

cardinal

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
lower

Athos

of
intrigues

secrets
of
state

continued
d'Artagnan

complying
*NL*
with
the
recommendation

``
There
can
be
no
doubt
we
would
all
be
broken

on
the
wheel

but
for
God

sake

do
not
forget

as
you
yourself
said

*NL*
Athos

that

only
write

soon

arrives

put

nearly
in

terms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see

assuming
in
advance
a
critical
look

friend

stickled
for

you

goat
pasture

Luxembourg

might

Athos

simply

I
have
obtained
proof
of
it
by
listening
to
her
conversation
with
*NL*
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lower
!
SACRE
BLEU
!
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
continued
Aramis
,
``
the
details
escape
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
also

''
said
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
and
Athos
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
silence
.
At
*NL*
length
Athos
,
after
serious
reflection
and
becoming
more
pale
than
*NL*
usual
,
made
a
sign
of
assent
to
d'Artagnan
,
who
by
it
understood
he
was
*NL*
at
liberty
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
what
you
have
to
say
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
:
``
My
Lord
,
your
*NL*
sister-in-law
is
an
infamous
woman
,
who
wished
to
have
you
killed
that
*NL*
she
might
inherit
your
wealth
;
but
she
could
not
marry
your
brother
,
*NL*
being
already
married
in
France
,
and
having
been

''
d'Artagnan
stopped
,
*NL*
as
if
seeking
for
the
word
,
and
looked
at
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Repudiated
by
her
husband
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
had
been
branded
,
''
continued
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
cried
Porthos
.
``
Impossible
!
What
do
you
say
--
that
she
wanted
to
*NL*
have
her
brother-in-law
killed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
married
?
''
asked
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
her
husband
found
out
that
she
had
a
fleur-de-lis
on
her
shoulder
?
''
*NL*
cried
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
three
yeses
had
been
pronounced
by
Athos
,
each
with
a
sadder
*NL*
intonation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
has
seen
this
fleur-de-lis
?
''
inquired
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
and
I.
Or
rather
,
to
observe
the
chronological
order
,
I
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
the
husband
of
this
frightful
creature
still
live
?
''
said
*NL*
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
still
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
quite
sure
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
he

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
cold
silence
,
during
which
everyone
was
affected
*NL*
according
to
his
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
time
,
''
said
Athos
,
first
breaking
the
silence
,
``
d'Artagnan
has
*NL*
given
us
an
excellent
program
,
and
the
letter
must
be
written
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
You
are
right
,
Athos
,
''
said
Aramis
;
``
and
it
is
a
rather
*NL*
difficult
matter
.
The
chancellor
himself
would
be
puzzled
how
to
write
*NL*
such
a
letter
,
and
yet
the
chancellor
draws
up
an
official
report
very
*NL*
readily
.
Never
mind
!
Be
silent
,
I
will
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
accordingly
took
the
quill
,
reflected
for
a
few
moments
,
wrote
*NL*
eight
or
ten
lines
in
a
charming
little
female
hand
,
and
then
with
a
*NL*
voice
soft
and
slow
,
as
if
each
word
had
been
scrupulously
weighed
,
he
*NL*
read
the
following
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
The
person
who
writes
these
few
lines
had
the
honor
of
*NL*
crossing
swords
with
you
in
the
little
enclosure
of
the
Rue
d'Enfer
.
As
*NL*
you
have
several
times
since
declared
yourself
the
friend
of
that
*NL*
person
,
he
thinks
it
his
duty
to
respond
to
that
friendship
by
sending
*NL*
you
important
information
.
Twice
you
have
nearly
been
the
victim
of
a
*NL*
near
relative
,
whom
you
believe
to
be
your
heir
because
you
are
ignorant
*NL*
that
before
she
contracted
a
marriage
in
England
she
was
already
married
*NL*
in
France
.
But
the
third
time
,
which
is
the
present
,
you
may
succumb
.
*NL*
Your
relative
left
La
Rochelle
for
England
during
the
night
.
Watch
her
*NL*
arrival
,
for
she
has
great
and
terrible
projects
.
If
you
require
to
know
*NL*
positively
what
she
is
capable
of
,
read
her
past
history
on
her
left
*NL*
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
that
will
do
wonderfully
well
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
My
dear
Aramis
,
*NL*
you
have
the
pen
of
a
secretary
of
state
.
Lord
de
Winter
will
now
be
*NL*
upon
his
guard
if
the
letter
should
reach
him
;
and
even
if
it
should
*NL*
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
cardinal
,
we
shall
not
be
compromised
.
But
as
*NL*
the
lackey
who
goes
may
make
us
believe
he
has
been
to
London
and
may
*NL*
stop
at
Chatellerault
,
let
us
give
him
only
half
the
sum
promised
him
,
*NL*
with
the
letter
,
with
an
agreement
that
he
shall
have
the
other
half
in
*NL*
exchange
for
the
reply
.
Have
you
the
diamond
?
''
continued
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
what
is
still
better
.
I
have
the
price
;
''
and
d'Artagnan
threw
*NL*
the
bag
upon
the
table
.
At
the
sound
of
the
gold
Aramis
raised
his
eyes
*NL*
and
Porthos
started
.
As
to
Athos
,
he
remained
unmoved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
in
that
little
bag
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
thousand
livres
,
in
louis
of
twelve
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
thousand
livres
!
''
cried
Porthos
.
``
That
poor
little
diamond
was
*NL*
worth
seven
thousand
livres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
so
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
since
here
they
are
.
I
do
n't
suppose
that
*NL*
our
friend
d'Artagnan
has
added
any
of
his
own
to
the
amount
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
gentlemen
,
in
all
this
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
we
do
not
think
of
the
*NL*
queen
.
Let
us
take
some
heed
of
the
welfare
of
her
dear
Buckingham
.
That
*NL*
is
the
least
we
owe
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true

said
Athos
;
``

that
concerns
Aramis

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

replied
the
latter
,
blushing
,
``
what
must
I
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
simple
enough
!
''
replied
Athos
.
``
Write
a
second
letter
for
*NL*
that
clever
personage
who
lives
at
Tours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
resumed
his
pen
,
reflected
a
little
,
and
wrote
the
following
*NL*
lines
,
which
he
immediately
submitted
to
the
approbation
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
cousin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
Athos
.
``
This
clever
person
is
your
relative

then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin-german

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
to
your
cousin

then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Cousin
,
His
Eminence
,
the
cardinal
,
whom
God
preserve
for
the
*NL*
happiness
of
France
and
the
confusion
of
the
enemies
of
the
kingdom
,
is
*NL*
on
the
point
of
putting
an
end
to
the
hectic
rebellion
of
La
Rochelle
.
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
the
succor
of
the
English
fleet
will
never
even
*NL*
arrive
in
sight
of
the
place
.
I
will
even
venture
to
say
that
I
am
*NL*
certain
M.
de
Buckingham
will
be
prevented
from
setting
out
by
some
*NL*
great
event
.
His
Eminence
is
the
most
illustrious
politician
of
times
*NL*
past
,
of
times
present
,
and
probably
of
times
to
come
.
He
would
*NL*
extinguish
the
sun
if
the
sun
incommoded
him
.
Give
these
happy
tidings
*NL*
to
your
sister
,
my
dear
cousin
.
I
have
dreamed
that
the
unlucky
*NL*
Englishman
was
dead
.
I
can
not
recollect
whether
it
was
by
steel
or
by
*NL*
poison
;
only
of
this
I
am
sure
,
I
have
dreamed
he
was
dead
,
and
you
know
*NL*
my
dreams
never
deceive
me

Be
assured
,
then

of
seeing
me
soon
return

*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
!
''
cried
Athos
;
``
you
are
the
king
of
poets

my
dear
Aramis

You
*NL*
speak
like
the
Apocalypse
,
and
you
are
as
true
as
the
Gospel
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
put
the
address
to
this
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
easily
done
,
''
said
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
the
letter
fancifully
,
and
took
up
his
pen
and
wrote
:

``
To
Mlle.
Michon
,
seamstress

Tours

*NL*
*NL*
The
three
friends
looked
at
one
another
and
laughed
;
they
were
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
you
will
please
to
understand
,
gentlemen
,
that
*NL*
Bazin
alone
can
carry
this
letter
to
Tours

My
cousin
knows
nobody
but
*NL*
Bazin
,
and
places
confidence
in
nobody
but
him
;
any
other
person
would
*NL*
fail
.
Besides
,
Bazin
is
ambitious
and
learned
;
Bazin
has
read
history
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
he
knows
that
Sixtus
the
Fifth
became
Pope
after
having
kept
*NL*
pigs
.
Well
,
as
he
means
to
enter
the
Church
at
the
same
time
as
myself
,
*NL*
he
does
not
despair
of
becoming
Pope
in
his
turn
,
or
at
least
a
*NL*
cardinal
.
You
can
understand
that
a
man
who
has
such
views
will
never
*NL*
allow
himself
to
be
taken
,
or
if
taken
,
will
undergo
martyrdom
rather
*NL*
than
speak

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
consent
to
Bazin
with
all
my
heart

grant
me
Planchet

Milady
had
him
one
day
turned
out
of
doors
,
with
*NL*
sundry
blows
of
a
good
stick
to
accelerate
his
motions

Now

Planchet
*NL*
has
an
excellent
memory
;
and
I
will
be
bound
that
sooner
than
relinquish
*NL*
any
possible
means
of
vengeance
,
he
will
allow
himself
to
be
beaten
to
*NL*
death

If
your
arrangements
at
Tours
are
your
arrangements

Aramis

*NL*
those
of
London
are
mine

I
request

then

that
Planchet
may
be
chosen

*NL*
more
particularly
as
he
has
already
been
to
London
with
me

knows

how

speak
correctly

London

sir

my
master

Lord

d'Artagnan

With

satisfied

his
way

going

In

*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
was
sent

The

in

pointed
out

venture
to
say
whether
it
was
from
*NL*
terror
created
by
the
threats
or
from
tenderness
at
seeing
four
friends
*NL*
so
closely
united
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
his
hand
.
``
See
,
Planchet
,
''
said
he
,
``
these
gentlemen
*NL*
only
say
this
out
of
affection
for
me
,
but
at
bottom
they
all
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
,
``
I
will
succeed
or
I
will
consent
to
be
*NL*
cut
in
quarters
;
and
if
they
do
cut
me
in
quarters
,
be
assured
that
not
*NL*
a
morsel
of
me
will
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
decided
that
Planchet
should
set
out
the
next
day
,
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
in
order
,
as
he
had
said
,
that
he
might
during
*NL*
the
night
learn
the
letter
by
heart
.
He
gained
just
twelve
hours
by
this
*NL*
engagement
;
he
was
to
be
back
on
the
sixteenth
day
,
by
eight
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
as
he
was
mounting
his
horse
,
d'Artagnan
,
who
felt
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
his
heart
a
partiality
for
the
duke
,
took
Planchet
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
he
to
him
.
``
When
you
have
given
the
letter
to
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
and
he
has
read
it
,
you
will
further
say
to
him
:
Watch
over
his
*NL*
Grace
Lord
Buckingham
,
for
they
wish
to
assassinate
him
.
But
this
,
*NL*
Planchet
,
is
so
serious
and
important
that
I
have
not
informed
my
*NL*
friends
that
I
would
entrust
this
secret
to
you
;
and
for
a
captain
's
*NL*
commission
I
would
not
write
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
,
monsieur
,
''
said
Planchet
,
``
you
shall
see
if
confidence
*NL*
can
be
placed
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mounted
on
an
excellent
horse
,
which
he
was
to
leave
at
the
end
of
*NL*
twenty
leagues
in
order
to
take
the
post
,
Planchet
set
off
at
a
gallop
,
*NL*
his
spirits
a
little
depressed
by
the
triple
promise
made
him
by
the
*NL*
Musketeers
,
but
otherwise
as
light-hearted
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
set
out
the
next
day
for
Tours
,
and
was
allowed
eight
days
for
*NL*
performing
his
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
friends
,
during
the
period
of
these
two
absences
,
had
,
as
may
*NL*
well
be
supposed
,
the
eye
on
the
watch
,
the
nose
to
the
wind
,
and
the
*NL*
ear
on
the
hark
.
Their
days
were
passed
in
endeavoring
to
catch
all
that
*NL*
was
said
,
in
observing
the
proceeding
of
the
cardinal
,
and
in
looking
*NL*
out
for
all
the
couriers
who
arrived
.
More
than
once
an
involuntary
*NL*
trembling
seized
them
when
called
upon
for
some
unexpected
service
.
They
*NL*
had
,
besides
,
to
look
constantly
to
their
own
proper
safety
;
Milady
was
*NL*
a
phantom
which
,
when
it
had
once
appeared
to
people
,
did
not
allow
them
*NL*
to
sleep
very
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
,
Bazin
,
fresh
as
ever
,
and
smiling
,
*NL*
according
to
custom
,
entered
the
cabaret
of
the
Parpaillot
as
the
four
*NL*
friends
were
sitting
down
to
breakfast
,
saying
,
as
had
been
agreed
upon
:
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Aramis
,
the
answer
from
your
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
friends
exchanged
a
joyful
glance
;
half
of
the
work
was
done
.
*NL*
It
is
true
,
however
,
that
it
was
the
shorter
and
easier
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
blushing
in
spite
of
himself
,
took
the
letter
,
which
was
in
a
*NL*
large
,
coarse
hand
and
not
particular
for
its
orthography
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
he
,
laughing
,
``
I
quite
despair
of
my
poor
Michon
;
she
*NL*
will
never
write
like
Monsieur
de
Voiture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
you
mean
by
boor
Michon
?
''
said
the
Swiss
,
who
was
chatting
*NL*
with
the
four
friends
when
the
letter
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pardieu
,
less
than
nothing
,
''
said
Aramis
;
``
a
charming
little
*NL*
seamstress
,
whom
I
love
dearly
and
from
whose
hand
I
requested
a
few
*NL*
lines
as
a
sort
of
keepsake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
duvil
!
''
said
the
Swiss
,
``
if
she
is
as
great
a
lady
as
her
writing
*NL*
is
large
,
you
are
a
lucky
fellow
,
gomrade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
read
the
letter
,
and
passed
it
to
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
she
writes
to
me
,
Athos
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
cast
a
glance
over
the
epistle
,
and
to
disperse
all
the
suspicions
*NL*
that
might
have
been
created
,
read
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
and
I
are
skillful
in
interpreting
dreams
,
and
even
entertain
*NL*
great
fear
of
them
;
but
of
yours
it
may
be
said
,
I
hope
,
every
dream
is
*NL*
an
illusion
.
Adieu
!
Take
care
of
yourself
,
and
act
so
that
we
may
from
*NL*
time
to
time
hear
you
spoken
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MARIE
MICHON
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
dream
does
she
mean
?
''
asked
the
dragoon
,
who
had
approached
*NL*
during
the
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yez
;
what
's
the
dream
?
''
said
the
Swiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
pardieu
!
''
said
Aramis
,
``
it
was
only
this
:
I
had
a
dream
,
and
I
*NL*
related
it
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yez
,
yez
,
''
said
the
Swiss
;
``
it
's
simple
enough
to
dell
a
dream
,
but
I
*NL*
neffer
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
fortunate
,
''
said
Athos
,
rising
;
``
I
wish
I
could
say
as
*NL*
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neffer
,
''
replied
the
Swiss
,
enchanted
that
a
man
like
Athos
could
envy
*NL*
him
anything
.
``
Neffer
,
neffer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
seeing
Athos
rise
,
did
likewise
,
took
his
arm
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
remained
behind
to
encounter
the
jokes
of
the
dragoon
*NL*
and
the
Swiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Bazin
,
he
went
and
lay
down
on
a
truss
of
straw
;
and
as
he
had
*NL*
more
imagination
than
the
Swiss
,
he
dreamed
that
Aramis
,
having
become
*NL*
pope
,
adorned
his
head
with
a
cardinal
's
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
we
have
said
,
Bazin
had
not
,
by
his
fortunate
return
,
removed
*NL*
more
than
a
part
of
the
uneasiness
which
weighed
upon
the
four
friends
.
*NL*
The
days
of
expectation
are
long
,
and
d'Artagnan
,
in
particular
,
would
*NL*
have
wagered
that
the
days
were
forty-four
hours
.
He
forgot
the
*NL*
necessary
slowness
of
navigation
;
he
exaggerated
to
himself
the
power
of
*NL*
Milady
.
He
credited
this
woman
,
who
appeared
to
him
the
equal
of
a
*NL*
demon
,
with
agents
as
supernatural
as
herself
;
at
the
least
noise
,
he
*NL*
imagined
himself
about
to
be
arrested
,
and
that
Planchet
was
being
*NL*
brought
back
to
be
confronted
with
himself
and
his
friends
.
Still
*NL*
further
,
his
confidence
in
the
worthy
Picard
,
at
one
time
so
great
,
*NL*
diminished
day
by
day
.
This
anxiety
became
so
great
that
it
even
*NL*
extended
to
Aramis
and
Porthos
.
Athos
alone
remained
unmoved
,
as
if
no
*NL*
danger
hovered
over
him
,
and
as
if
he
breathed
his
customary
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sixteenth
day
,
in
particular
,
these
signs
were
so
strong
in
*NL*
d'Artagnan
and
his
two
friends
that
they
could
not
remain
quiet
in
one
*NL*
place
,
and
wandered
about
like
ghosts
on
the
road
by
which
Planchet
was
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
said
Athos
to
them
,
``
you
are
not
men
but
children
,
to
let
a
*NL*
woman
terrify
you
so
!
And
what
does
it
amount
to
,
after
all
?
To
be
*NL*
imprisoned
.
Well
,
but
we
should
be
taken
out
of
prison
;
Madame
Bonacieux
*NL*
was
released
.
To
be
decapitated
?
Why
,
every
day
in
the
trenches
we
go
*NL*
cheerfully
to
expose
ourselves
to
worse
than
that
--
for
a
bullet
may
*NL*
break
a
leg
,
and
I
am
convinced
a
surgeon
would
give
us
more
pain
in
*NL*
cutting
off
a
thigh
than
an
executioner
in
cutting
off
a
head
.
Wait
*NL*
quietly
,
then
;
in
two
hours
,
in
four
,
in
six
hours
at
latest
,
Planchet
*NL*
will
be
here
.
He
promised
to
be
here
,
and
I
have
very
great
faith
in
*NL*
Planchet
,
who
appears
to
me
to
be
a
very
good
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
does
not
come
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
he
does
not
come
,
it
will
be
because
he
has
been
delayed
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
He
may
have
fallen
from
his
horse
,
he
may
have
cut
a
caper
*NL*
from
the
deck
;
he
may
have
traveled
so
fast
against
the
wind
as
to
have
*NL*
brought
on
a
violent
catarrh
.
Eh
,
gentlemen
,
let
us
reckon
upon
*NL*
accidents
!
Life
is
a
chaplet
of
little
miseries
which
the
philosopher
*NL*
counts
with
a
smile
.
Be
philosophers
,
as
I
am
,
gentlemen
;
sit
down
at
*NL*
the
table
and
let
us
drink
.
Nothing
makes
the
future
look
so
bright
as
*NL*
surveying
it
through
a
glass
of
chambertin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
very
well
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
I
am
tired
of
fearing
*NL*
when
I
open
a
fresh
bottle
that
the
wine
may
come
from
the
cellar
of
*NL*
Milady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
fastidious
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
such
a
beautiful
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
of
mark
!
''
said
Porthos
,
with
his
loud
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
started
,
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
to
remove
the
drops
of
*NL*
perspiration
that
burst
forth
,
and
rose
in
his
turn
with
a
nervous
*NL*
movement
he
could
not
repress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
,
however
,
passed
away
;
and
the
evening
came
on
slowly
,
but
*NL*
finally
it
came
.
The
bars
were
filled
with
drinkers
.
Athos
,
who
had
*NL*
pocketed
his
share
of
the
diamond
,
seldom
quit
the
Parpaillot
.
He
had
*NL*
found
in
M.
de
Busigny
,
who
,
by
the
by
,
had
given
them
a
magnificent
*NL*
dinner
,
a
partner
worthy
of
his
company
.
They
were
playing
together
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
when
seven
o'clock
sounded
;
the
patrol
was
heard
passing
to
*NL*
double
the
posts
.
At
half
past
seven
the
retreat
was
sounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
lost
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
in
the
ear
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
say
we
have
lost
,
''
said
Athos
,
quietly
,
drawing
four
*NL*
pistoles
from
his
pocket
and
throwing
them
upon
the
table
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
they
are
beating
the
tattoo
.
Let
us
to
bed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Athos
went
out
of
the
Parpaillot
,
followed
by
d'Artagnan
.
Aramis
*NL*
came
behind
,
giving
his
arm
to
Porthos
.
Aramis
mumbled
verses
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
Porthos
from
time
to
time
pulled
a
hair
or
two
from
his
*NL*
mustache
,
in
sign
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
at
once
a
shadow
appeared
in
the
darkness
the
outline
of
which
*NL*
was
familiar
to
d'Artagnan
,
and
a
well-known
voice
said
,
``
Monsieur
,
I
*NL*
have
brought
your
cloak
;
it
is
chilly
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
beside
himself
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Planchet
!
''
repeated
Aramis
and
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
Planchet
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
what
is
there
so
*NL*
astonishing
in
that
?
He
promised
to
be
back
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
eight
*NL*
is
striking
.
Bravo
,
Planchet
,
you
are
a
lad
of
your
word
,
and
if
ever
*NL*
you
leave
your
master
,
I
will
promise
you
a
place
in
my
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
never
,
''
said
Planchet
,
``
I
will
never
leave
Monsieur
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
d'Artagnan
felt
that
Planchet
slipped
a
note
into
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
embrace
Planchet
as
he
had
*NL*
embraced
him
on
his
departure
;
but
he
feared
lest
this
mark
of
*NL*
affection
,
bestowed
upon
his
lackey
in
the
open
street
,
might
appear
*NL*
extraordinary
to
passers-by
,
and
he
restrained
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
note
,
''
said
he
to
Athos
and
to
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
let
us
go
home
and
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
note
burned
the
hand
of
d'Artagnan
.
He
wished
to
hasten
their
steps
;
*NL*
but
Athos
took
his
arm
and
passed
it
under
his
own
,
and
the
young
man
*NL*
was
forced
to
regulate
his
pace
by
that
of
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
they
reached
the
tent
,
lit
a
lamp
,
and
while
Planchet
stood
at
*NL*
the
entrance
that
the
four
friends
might
not
be
surprised
,
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
with
a
trembling
hand
,
broke
the
seal
and
opened
the
so
anxiously
*NL*
expected
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
contained
half
a
line
,
in
a
hand
perfectly
British
,
and
with
a
*NL*
conciseness
as
perfectly
Spartan
:
*NL*
*NL*
Thank
you
;
be
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
d'Artagnan
translated
this
for
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
took
the
letter
from
the

of
d'Artagnan

approached
the
lamp
,
*NL*
set
fire
to
the
paper
,
and
did
not
let
go
till
it
was
reduced
to
a
*NL*
cinder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
calling
Planchet
,
he
said
,
``
Now
,
my
lad
,
you
may
claim
your
seven
*NL*
hundred
livres
,
but
you
did
not
run
much
risk
with
such
a
note
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
to
blame
for
having
tried
every
means
to
compress
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Planchet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
tell
us
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dame
,
that
's
a
long
job
,
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Planchet
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
besides
,
the
tattoo
has
been
*NL*
sounded
,
and
we
should
be
observed
if
we
kept
a
light
burning
much
*NL*
longer
than
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Go
to
bed
,
Planchet
,
and
sleep
soundly

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith

monsieur

that

I

done
so
for

sixteen

d'Artagnan

*NL*
*NL*
``

Porthos

*NL*

*NL*
``

FATALITY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Milady
,
drunk
with
passion
,
roaring
on
the
deck
like
a
lioness
*NL*
that
has
been
embarked
,
had
been
tempted
to
throw
herself
into
the
sea
*NL*
that
she
might
regain
the
coast
,
for
she
could
not
get
rid
of
the
*NL*
thought
that
she
had
been
insulted
by
d'Artagnan
,
threatened
by
Athos
,
*NL*
and
that
she
had
quit
France
without
being
revenged
on
them
.
This
idea
*NL*
soon
became
so
insupportable
to
her
that
at
the
risk
of
whatever
*NL*
terrible
consequences
might
result
to
herself
from
it
,
she
implored
the
*NL*
captain
to
put
her
on
shore
;
but
the
captain
,
eager
to
escape
from
his
*NL*
false
position
--
placed
between
French
and
English
cruisers
,
like
the
bat
*NL*
between
the
mice
and
the
birds
--
was
in
great
haste
to
regain
England
,
*NL*
and
positively
refused
to
obey
what
he
took
for
a
woman
's
caprice
,
*NL*
promising
his
passenger
,
who
had
been
particularly
recommended
to
him
by
*NL*
the
cardinal
,
to
land
her
,
if
the
sea
and
the
French
permitted
him
,
at
*NL*
one
of
the
ports
of
Brittany
,
either
at
Lorient
or
Brest
.
But
the
wind
*NL*
was
contrary
,
the
sea
bad
;
they
tacked
and
kept
offshore
.
Nine
days
*NL*
after
leaving
the
Charente
,
pale
with
fatigue
and
vexation
,
Milady
saw
*NL*
only
the
blue
coasts
of
Finisterre
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
calculated
that
to
cross
this
corner
of
France
and
return
to
the
*NL*
cardinal
it
would
take
her
at
least
three
days
.
Add
another
day
for
*NL*
landing
,
and
that
would
make
four
.
Add
these
four
to
the
nine
others
,
*NL*
that
would
be
thirteen
days
lost
--
thirteen
days
,
during
which
so
many
*NL*
important
events
might
pass
in
London
.
She
reflected
likewise
that
the
*NL*
cardinal
would
be
furious
at
her
return
,
and
consequently
would
be
more
*NL*
disposed
to
listen
to
the
complaints
brought
against
her
than
to
the
*NL*
accusations
she
brought
against
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
allowed
the
vessel
to
pass
Lorient
and
Brest
without
repeating
her
*NL*
request
to
the
captain
,
who
,
on
his
part
,
took
care
not
to
remind
her
of
*NL*
it
.
Milady
therefore
continued
her
voyage
,
and
on
the
very
day
that
*NL*
Planchet
embarked
at
Portsmouth
for
France
,
the
messenger
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
entered
the
port
in
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
city
was
agitated
by
an
extraordinary
movement
.
Four
large
*NL*
vessels
,
recently
built
,
had
just
been
launched
.
At
the
end
of
the
*NL*
jetty
,
his
clothes
richly
laced
with
gold
,
glittering
,
as
was
customary
*NL*
with
him
,
with
diamonds
and
precious
stones
,
his
hat
ornamented
with
a
*NL*
white
feather
which
drooped
upon
his
shoulder
,
Buckingham
was
seen
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
staff
almost
as
brilliant
as
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
rare
and
beautiful
days
in
winter
when
England
*NL*
remembers
that
there
is
a
sun
.
The
star
of
day
,
pale
but
nevertheless
*NL*
still
splendid
,
was
setting
in
the
horizon
,
glorifying
at
once
the
*NL*
heavens
and
the
sea
with
bands
of
fire
,
and
casting
upon
the
towers
and
*NL*
the
old
houses
of
the
city
a
last
ray
of
gold
which
made
the
windows
*NL*
sparkle
like
the
reflection
of
a
conflagration
.
Breathing
that
sea
*NL*
breeze
,
so
much
more
invigorating
and
balsamic
as
the
land
is
*NL*
approached
,
contemplating
all
the
power
of
those
preparations
she
was
*NL*
commissioned
to
destroy
,
all
the
power
of
that
army
which
she
was
to
*NL*
combat
alone
--
she
,
a
woman
with
a
few
bags
of
gold
--
Milady
compared
*NL*
herself
mentally
to
Judith
,
the
terrible
Jewess
,
when
she
penetrated
the
*NL*
camp
of
the
Assyrians
and
beheld
the
enormous
mass
of
chariots
,
horses
,
*NL*
men
,
and
arms
,
which
a
gesture
of
her
hand
was
to
dissipate
like
a
cloud
*NL*
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
roadstead
;
but
as
they
drew
near
in
order
to
cast
*NL*
anchor
,
a
little
cutter
,
looking
like
a
coastguard
formidably
armed
,
*NL*
approached
the
merchant
vessel
and
dropped
into
the
sea
a
boat
which
*NL*
directed
its
course
to
the
ladder
.
This
boat
contained
an
officer
,
a
*NL*
mate
,
and
eight
rowers
.
The
officer
alone
went
on
board
,
where
he
was
*NL*
received
with
all
the
deference
inspired
by
the
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
conversed
a
few
instants
with
the
captain
,
gave
him
several
*NL*
papers
,
of
which
he
was
the
bearer
,
to
read
,
and
upon
the
order
of
the
*NL*
merchant
captain
the
whole
crew
of
the
vessel
,
both
passengers
and
*NL*
sailors
,
were
called
upon
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
species
of
summons
was
made
the
officer
inquired
aloud
the
*NL*
point
of
the
brig
's
departure
,
its
route
,
its
landings
;
and
to
all
these
*NL*
questions
the
captain
replied
without
difficulty
and
without
hesitation
.
*NL*
Then
the
officer
began
to
pass
in
review
all
the
people
,
one
after
the
*NL*
other
,
and
stopping
when
he
came
to
Milady
,
surveyed
her
very
closely
,
*NL*
but
without
addressing
a
single
word
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
returned
to
the
captain
,
said
a
few
words
to
him
,
and
as
if
from
*NL*
that
moment
the
vessel
was
under
his
command
,
he
ordered
a
maneuver
*NL*
which
the
crew
executed
immediately
.
Then
the
vessel
resumed
its
course
,
*NL*
still
escorted
by
the
little
cutter
,
which
sailed
side
by
side
with
it
,
*NL*
menacing
it
with
the
mouths
of
its
six
cannon
.
The
boat
followed
in
the
*NL*
wake
of
the
ship
,
a
speck
near
the
enormous
mass
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
examination
of
Milady
by
the
officer
,
as
may
well
be
*NL*
imagined
,
Milady
on
her
part
was
not
less
scrutinizing
in
her
glances
.
*NL*
But
however
great
was
the
power
of
this
woman
with
eyes
of
flame
in
*NL*
reading
the
hearts
of
those
whose
secrets
she
wished
to
divine
,
she
met
*NL*
this
time
with
a
countenance
of
such
impassivity
that
no
discovery
*NL*
followed
her
investigation
.
The
officer
who
had
stopped
in
front
of
her
*NL*
and
studied
her
with
so
much
care
might
have
been
twenty-five
or
*NL*
twenty-six
years
of
age
.
He
was
of
pale
complexion
,
with
clear
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
rather
deeply
set
;
his
mouth
,
fine
and
well
cut
,
remained
*NL*
motionless
in
its
correct
lines
;
his
chin
,
strongly
marked
,
denoted
that
*NL*
strength
of
will
which
in
the
ordinary
Britannic
type
denotes
mostly
*NL*
nothing
but
obstinacy
;
a
brow
a
little
receding
,
as
is
proper
for
poets
,
*NL*
enthusiasts
,
and
soldiers
,
was
scarcely
shaded
by
short
thin
hair
which
,
*NL*
like
the
beard
which
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
was
of
a
*NL*
beautiful
deep
chestnut
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
the
port
,
it
was
already
night
.
The
fog
increased
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
formed
round
the
sternlights
and
lanterns
of
the
jetty
a
*NL*
circle
like
that
which
surrounds
the
moon
when
the
weather
threatens
to
*NL*
become
rainy
.
The
air
they
breathed
was
heavy
,
damp
,
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
that
woman
so
courageous
and
firm
,
shivered
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
desired
to
have
Milady
's
packages
pointed
out
to
him
,
and
*NL*
ordered
them
to
be
placed
in
the
boat
.
When
this
operation
was
complete
,
*NL*
he
invited
her
to
descend
by
offering
her
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
looked
at
this
man
,
and
hesitated
.
``
Who
are
you
,
sir
,
''
asked
she
,
*NL*
``
who
has
the
kindness
to
trouble
yourself
so
particularly
on
my
*NL*
account
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
perceive
,
madame
,
by
my
uniform
,
that
I
am
an
officer
in
the
*NL*
English
navy
,
''
replied
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
the
custom
for
the
officers
in
the
English
navy
to
place
*NL*
themselves
at
the
service
of
their
female
compatriots
when
they
land
in
*NL*
a
port
of
Great
Britain
,
and
carry
their
gallantry
so
far
as
to
conduct
*NL*
them
ashore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
,
it
is
the
custom
,
not
from
gallantry
but
prudence
,
that
in
*NL*
time
of
war
foreigners
should
be
conducted
to
particular
hotels
,
in
*NL*
order
that
they
may
remain
under
the
eye
of
the
government
until
full
*NL*
information
can
be
obtained
about
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
pronounced
with
the
most
exact
politeness
and
the
most
*NL*
perfect
calmness
.
Nevertheless
,
they
had
not
the
power
of
convincing
*NL*
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
not
a
foreigner
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
with
an
accent
as
pure
as
*NL*
ever
was
heard
between
Portsmouth
and
Manchester
;
``
my
name
is
Lady
*NL*
Clarik
,
and
this
measure
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
measure
is
general
,
madame
;
and
you
will
seek
in
vain
to
evade
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
follow
you
,
then
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accepting
the
hand
of
the
officer
,
she
began
the
descent
of
the
ladder
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
which
the
boat
waited
.
The
officer
followed
her
.
A
large
*NL*
cloak
was
spread
at
the
stern
;
the
officer
requested
her
to
sit
down
*NL*
upon
this
cloak
,
and
placed
himself
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Row
!
''
said
he
to
the
sailors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eight
oars
fell
at
once
into
the
sea
,
making
but
a
single
sound
,
*NL*
giving
but
a
single
stroke
,
and
the
boat
seemed
to
fly
over
the
surface
*NL*
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
minutes
they
gained
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
leaped
to
the
pier
,
and
offered
his
hand
to
Milady
.
A
*NL*
carriage
was
in
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
carriage
for
us
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hotel
,
then
,
is
far
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Milady
;
and
she
resolutely
entered
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
saw
that
the
baggage
was
fastened
carefully
behind
the
*NL*
carriage
;
and
this
operation
ended
,
he
took
his
place
beside
Milady
,
and
*NL*
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
,
without
any
order
being
given
or
his
place
of
destination
*NL*
indicated
,
the
coachman
set
off
at
a
rapid
pace
,
and
plunged
into
the
*NL*
streets
of
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
strange
a
reception
naturally
gave
Milady
ample
matter
for
*NL*
reflection
;
so
seeing
that
the
young
officer
did
not
seem
at
all
*NL*
disposed
for
conversation
,
she
reclined
in
her
corner
of
the
carriage
,
*NL*
and
one
after
the
other
passed
in
review
all
the
surmises
which
*NL*
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
however
,
surprised
at
the
length
of
*NL*
the
journey
,
she
leaned
forward
toward
the
door
to
see
whither
she
was
*NL*
being
conducted
.
Houses
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
;
trees
appeared
in
the
*NL*
darkness
like
great
black
phantoms
chasing
one
another
.
Milady
*NL*
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
are
no
longer
in
the
city
,
sir
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
preserved
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
understand
,
sir
,
I
will
go
no
farther
unless
you
tell
me
*NL*
whither
you
are
taking
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
threat
brought
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
too
much
,
''
cried
Milady
.
``
Help
!
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
voice
replied
to
hers
;
the
carriage
continued
to
roll
on
with
*NL*
rapidity
;
the
officer
seemed
a
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
looked
at
the
officer
with
one
of
those
terrible
expressions
*NL*
peculiar
to
her
countenance
,
and
which
so
rarely
failed
of
their
effect
;
*NL*
anger
made
her
eyes
flash
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
remained
immovable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
tried
to
open
the
door
in
order
to
throw
herself
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
,
madame
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
coolly
,
``
you
will
kill
yourself
*NL*
in
jumping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
reseated
herself
,
foaming
.
The
officer
leaned
forward
,
looked
at
*NL*
her
in
his
turn
,
and
appeared
surprised
to
see
that
face
,
just
before
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
distorted
with
passion
and
almost
hideous
.
The
artful
*NL*
creature
at
once
comprehended
that
she
was
injuring
herself
by
allowing
*NL*
him
thus
to
read
her
soul
;
she
collected
her
features
,
and
in
a
*NL*
complaining
voice
said
:
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
sir
,
tell
me
if
it
is
to
*NL*
you
,
if
it
is
to
your
government
,
if
it
is
to
an
enemy
I
am
to
attribute
*NL*
the
violence
that
is
done
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
violence
will
be
offered
to
you
,
madame
,
and
what
happens
to
you
is
*NL*
the
result
of
a
very
simple
measure
which
we
are
obliged
to
adopt
with
*NL*
all
who
land
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
n't
know
me
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
first
time
I
have
had
the
honor
of
seeing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
your
honor
,
you
have
no
cause
of
hatred
against
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
,
I
swear
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
serenity
,
coolness
,
mildness
even
,
in
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
young
man
,
that
Milady
felt
reassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
after
a
journey
of
nearly
an
hour
,
the
carriage
stopped
before
*NL*
an
iron
gate
,
which
closed
an
avenue
leading
to
a
castle
severe
in
form
,
*NL*
massive
,
and
isolated
.
Then
,
as
the
wheels
rolled
over
a
fine
gravel
,
*NL*
Milady
could
hear
a
vast
roaring
,
which
she
at
once
recognized
as
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
sea
dashing
against
some
steep
cliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
passed
under
two
arched
gateways
,
and
at
length
stopped
in
*NL*
a
court
large
,
dark
,
and
square
.
Almost
immediately
the
door
of
the
*NL*
carriage
was
opened
,
the
young
man
sprang
lightly
out
and
presented
his
*NL*
hand
to
Milady
,
who
leaned
upon
it
,
and
in
her
turn
alighted
with
*NL*
tolerable
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
then
,
I
am
a
prisoner
,
''
said
Milady
,
looking
around
her
,
and
*NL*
bringing
back
her
eyes
with
a
most
gracious
smile
to
the
young
officer
;
*NL*
``
but
I
feel
assured
it
will
not
be
for
long
,
''
added
she
.
``
My
own
*NL*
conscience
and
your
politeness
,
sir
,
are
the
guarantees
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
flattering
this
compliment
,
the
officer
made
no
reply
;
but
*NL*
drawing
from
his
belt
a
little
silver
whistle
,
such
as
boatswains
use
in
*NL*
ships
of
war
,
he
whistled
three
times
,
with
three
different
modulations
.
*NL*
Immediately
several
men
appeared
,
who
unharnessed
the
smoking
horses
,
*NL*
and
put
the
carriage
into
a
coach
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
officer
,
with
the
same
calm
politeness
,
invited
his
prisoner
to
*NL*
enter
the
house
.
She
,
with
a
still-smiling
countenance
,
took
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
passed
with
him
under
a
low
arched
door
,
which
by
a
vaulted
passage
,
*NL*
lighted
only
at
the
farther
end
,
led
to
a
stone
staircase
around
an
*NL*
angle
of
stone
.
They
then
came
to
a
massive
door
,
which
after
the
*NL*
introduction
into
the
lock
of
a
key
which
the
young
man
carried
with
*NL*
him
,
turned
heavily
upon
its
hinges
,
and
disclosed
the
chamber
destined
*NL*
for
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
single
glance
the
prisoner
took
in
the
apartment
in
its
minutest
*NL*
details
.
It
was
a
chamber
whose
furniture
was
at
once
appropriate
for
a
*NL*
prisoner
or
a
free
man
;
and
yet
bars
at
the
windows
and
outside
bolts
at
*NL*
the
door
decided
the
question
in
favor
of
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
all
the
strength
of
mind
of
this
creature
,
though
drawn
*NL*
from
the
most
vigorous
sources
,
abandoned
her
;
she
sank
into
a
large
*NL*
easy
chair
,
with
her
arms
crossed
,
her
head
lowered
,
and
expecting
every
*NL*
instant
to
see
a
judge
enter
to
interrogate
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
one
entered
except
two
or
three
marines
,
who
brought
her
trunks
*NL*
and
packages
,
deposited
them
in
a
corner
,
and
retired
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
superintended
all
these
details
with
the
same
calmness
*NL*
Milady
had
constantly
seen
in
him
,
never
pronouncing
a
word
himself
,
and
*NL*
making
himself
obeyed
by
a
gesture
of
his
hand
or
a
sound
of
his
*NL*
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
said
that
between
this
man
and
his
inferiors
spoken
*NL*
language
did
not
exist
,
or
had
become
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Milady
could
hold
out
no
longer
;
she
broke
the
silence
.
``
In
*NL*
the
name
of
heaven
,
sir
,
''
cried
she
,
``
what
means
all
that
is
passing
?
*NL*
Put
an
end
to
my
doubts
;
I
have
courage
enough
for
any
danger
I
can
*NL*
foresee
,
for
every
misfortune
which
I
understand
.
Where
am
I
,
and
why
am
*NL*
I
here
?
If
I
am
free
,
why
these
bars
and
these
doors
?
If
I
am
a
*NL*
prisoner
,
what
crime
have
I
committed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
here
in
the
apartment
destined
for
you
,
madame
.
I
received
*NL*
orders
to
go
and
take
charge
of
you
on
the
sea
,
and
to
conduct
you
to
*NL*
this
castle
.
This
order
I
believe
I
have
accomplished
with
all
the
*NL*
exactness
of
a
soldier
,
but
also
with
the
courtesy
of
a
gentleman
.
There
*NL*
terminates
,
at
least
to
the
present
moment
,
the
duty
I
had
to
fulfill
*NL*
toward
you
;
the
rest
concerns
another
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
that
other
person
?
''
asked
Milady
,
warmly
.
``
Can
you
not
tell
*NL*
me
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
a
great
jingling
of
spurs
was
heard
on
the
stairs
.
Some
*NL*
voices
passed
and
faded
away
,
and
the
sound
of
a
single
footstep
*NL*
approached
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
person
is
here
,
madame
,
''
said
the
officer
,
leaving
the
entrance
*NL*
open
,
and
drawing
himself
up
in
an
attitude
of
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
the
door
opened
;
a
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
.
He
*NL*
was
without
a
hat
,
carried
a
sword
,
and
flourished
a
handkerchief
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
thought
she
recognized
this
shadow
in
the
gloom
;
she
supported
*NL*
herself
with
one
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
advanced
her
head
*NL*
as
if
to
meet
a
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
advanced
slowly
,
and
as
he
advanced
,
after
entering
into
*NL*
the
circle
of
light
projected
by
the
lamp
,
Milady
involuntarily
drew
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
when
she
had
no
longer
any
doubt
,
she
cried
,
in
a
state
of
stupor
,
*NL*
``
What
,
my
brother
,
is
it
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
fair
lady
!
''
replied
Lord
de
Winter
,
making
a
bow
,
half
courteous
,
*NL*
half
ironical
;
``
it
is
I
,
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
castle
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
chamber
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
then
,
your
prisoner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
a
frightful
abuse
of
power
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
high-sounding
words
!
Let
us
sit
down
and
chat
quietly
,
as
brother
*NL*
and
sister
ought
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
toward
the
door
,
and
seeing
that
the
young
officer
was
*NL*
waiting
for
his
last
orders
,
he
said
.
``
All
is
well
,
I
thank
you
;
now
*NL*
leave
us
alone
,
Mr.
Felton
.

*NL*

50
CHAT
BETWEEN
BROTHER
AND
SISTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
time
which
Lord
de
Winter
took
to
shut
the
door
,
close
a
*NL*
shutter
,
and
draw
a
chair
near
to
his
sister-in-law
's
fauteuil
,
Milady
,
*NL*
anxiously
thoughtful
,
plunged
her
glance
into
the
depths
of
possibility
,
*NL*
and
discovered
all
the
plan
,
of
which
she
could
not
even
obtain
a
glance
*NL*
as
long
as
she
was
ignorant
into
whose
hands
she
had
fallen
.
She
knew
*NL*
her
brother-in-law
to
be
a
worthy
gentleman
,
a
bold
hunter
,
an
intrepid
*NL*
player
,
enterprising
with
women
,
but
by
no
means
remarkable
for
his
*NL*
skill
in
intrigues
.
How
had
he
discovered
her
arrival
,
and
caused
her
to
*NL*
be
seized
?
Why
did
he
detain
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
had
dropped
some
words
which
proved
that
the
conversation
she
had
*NL*
with
the
cardinal
had
fallen
into
outside
ears
;
but
she
could
not
*NL*
suppose
that
he
had
dug
a
countermine
so
promptly
and
so
boldly
.
She
*NL*
rather
feared
that
her
preceding
operations
in
England
might
have
been
*NL*
discovered
.
Buckingham
might
have
guessed
that
it
was
she
who
had
cut
*NL*
off
the
two
studs
,
and
avenge
himself
for
that
little
treachery
;
but
*NL*
Buckingham
was
incapable
of
going
to
any
excess
against
a
woman
,
*NL*
particularly
if
that
woman
was
supposed
to
have
acted
from
a
feeling
of
*NL*
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
supposition
appeared
to
her
most
reasonable
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
they
wanted
to
revenge
the
past
,
and
not
to
anticipate
the
future
.
At
*NL*
all
events
,
she
congratulated
herself
upon
having
fallen
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
her
brother-in-law
,
with
whom
she
reckoned
she
could
deal
very
*NL*
easily
,
rather
than
into
the
hands
of
an
acknowledged
and
intelligent
*NL*
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
let
us
chat
,
brother
,
''
said
she
,
with
a
kind
of
cheerfulness
,
*NL*
decided
as
she
was
to
draw
from
the
conversation
,
in
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
dissimulation
Lord
de
Winter
could
bring
,
the
revelations
of
which
she
*NL*
stood
in
need
to
regulate
her
future
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
then
,
decided
to
come
to
England
again
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
*NL*
``
in
spite
of
the
resolutions
you
so
often
expressed
in
Paris
never
to
*NL*
set
your
feet
on
British
ground
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
replied
to
this
question
by
another
question
.
``
To
begin
with
,
*NL*
tell
me
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
have
you
watched
me
so
closely
as
to
be
aware
*NL*
beforehand
not
only
of
my
arrival
,
but
even
of
the
day
,
the
hour
,
and
*NL*
the
port
at
which
I
should
arrive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
adopted
the
same
tactics
as
Milady
,
thinking
that
as
his
*NL*
sister-in-law
employed
them
they
must
be
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
,
my
dear
sister
,
''
replied
he
,
``
what
makes
you
come
to
*NL*
England
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
to
see
you
,
''
replied
Milady
,
without
knowing
how
much
she
*NL*
aggravated
by
this
reply
the
suspicions
to
which
d'Artagnan
's
letter
had
*NL*
given
birth
in
the
mind
of
her
brother-in-law
,
and
only
desiring
to
gain
*NL*
the
good
will
of
her
auditor
by
a
falsehood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
see
me
?
''
said
de
Winter
,
cunningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
to
see
you
.
What
is
there
astonishing
in
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
had
no
other
object
in
coming
to
England
but
to
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
for
me
alone
you
have
taken
the
trouble
to
cross
the
*NL*
Channel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
What
tenderness
,
my
sister
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
am
I
not
your
nearest
relative
?
''
demanded
Milady
,
with
a
tone
of
*NL*
the
most
touching
ingenuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
only
heir
,
are
you
not
?
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
in
his
turn
,
fixing
*NL*
his
eyes
on
those
of
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
command
she
had
over
herself
,
Milady
could
not
help
starting
;
*NL*
and
as
in
pronouncing
the
last
words
Lord
de
Winter
placed
his
hand
upon
*NL*
the
arm
of
his
sister
,
this
start
did
not
escape
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
blow
was
direct
and
severe
.
The
first
idea
that
occurred
to
*NL*
Milady
's
mind
was
that
she
had
been
betrayed
by
Kitty
,
and
that
she
had
*NL*
recounted
to
the
baron
the
selfish
aversion
toward
himself
of
which
she
*NL*
had
imprudently
allowed
some
marks
to
escape
before
her
servant
.
She
*NL*
also
recollected
the
furious
and
imprudent
attack
she
had
made
upon
*NL*
d'Artagnan
when
he
spared
the
life
of
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
,
my
Lord
,
''
said
she
,
in
order
to
gain
time
and
make
*NL*
her
adversary
speak
out
.
``
What
do
you
mean
to
say
?
Is
there
any
secret
*NL*
meaning
concealed
beneath
your
words
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
no
!
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
with
apparent
good
nature
.
``
You
*NL*
wish
to
see
me
,
and
you
come
to
England
.
I
learn
this
desire
,
or
rather
*NL*
I
suspect
that
you
feel
it
;
and
in
order
to
spare
you
all
the
annoyances
*NL*
of
a
nocturnal
arrival
in
a
port
and
all
the
fatigues
of
landing
,
I
send
*NL*
one
of
my
officers
to
meet
you
,
I
place
a
carriage
at
his
orders
,
and
he
*NL*
brings
you
hither
to
this
castle
,
of
which
I
am
governor
,
whither
I
come
*NL*
every
day
,
and
where
,
in
order
to
satisfy
our
mutual
desire
of
seeing
*NL*
each
other
,
I
have
prepared
you
a
chamber
.
What
is
there
more
*NL*
astonishing
in
all
that
I
have
said
to
you
than
in
what
you
have
told
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
what
I
think
astonishing
is
that
you
should
expect
my
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
that
is
the
most
simple
thing
in
the
world
,
my
dear
sister
.
*NL*
Have
you
not
observed
that
the
captain
of
your
little
vessel
,
on
*NL*
entering
the
roadstead
,
sent
forward
,
in
order
to
obtain
permission
to
*NL*
enter
the
port
,
a
little
boat
bearing
his
logbook
and
the
register
of
*NL*
his
voyagers
?
I
am
commandant
of
the
port
.
They
brought
me
that
book
.
I
*NL*
recognized
your
name
in
it
.
My
heart
told
me
what
your
mouth
has
just
*NL*
confirmed
--
that
is
to
say
,
with
what
view
you
have
exposed
yourself
to
*NL*
the
dangers
of
a
sea
so
perilous
,
or
at
least
so
troublesome
at
this
*NL*
moment
--
and
I
sent
my
cutter
to
meet
you
.
You
know
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
knew
that
Lord
de
Winter
lied
,
and
she
was
the
more
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
,
''
continued
she
,
``
was
not
that
my
Lord
Buckingham
whom
I
saw
*NL*
on
the
jetty
this
evening
as
we
arrived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Himself
.
Ah
,
I
can
understand
how
the
sight
of
him
struck
you
,
''
replied
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
You
came
from
a
country
where
he
must
be
very
much
*NL*
talked
of
,
and
I
know
that
his
armaments
against
France
greatly
engage
*NL*
the
attention
of
your
friend
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
the
cardinal
!
''
cried
Milady
,
seeing
that
on
this
point
as
on
*NL*
the
other
Lord
de
Winter
seemed
well
instructed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
not
your
friend
?
''
replied
the
baron
,
negligently
.
``
Ah
,
pardon
!
I
*NL*
thought
so
;
but
we
will
return
to
my
Lord
Duke
presently
.
Let
us
not
*NL*
depart
from
the
sentimental
turn
our
conversation
had
taken
.
You
came
,
*NL*
you
say
,
to
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
reply
that
you
shall
be
served
to
the
height

shall
see
each
other
every

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
,
then
,
to
remain
here
eternally

demanded
Milady
,
with
a
certain
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
yourself
badly
lodged

Demand
anything
you

I
will
hasten

have
you
furnished
with
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
have
neither
my
women

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
all

me
on

established
by

although
I
am
only
your

I
will
arrange
one
similar

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first

cried
Milady
,
looking
at
Lord
de
Winter
with
eyes
*NL*
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
French
husband

I
do

as
he
is
still
living

I
can
write
to
him
and
he
will
send
me
*NL*
information
on
the
subject

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
sweat
burst
from
the
brow
of
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
jest
!
''
said
she
,
in
a
hollow
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
look
so
?
''
asked
the
baron
,
rising
and
going
a
step
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
rather
you
insult
me
,
''
continued
she
,
pressing
with
her
stiffened
*NL*
hands
the
two
arms
of
her
easy
chair
,
and
raising
herself
upon
her
*NL*
wrists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
insult
you
!
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
with
contempt
.
``
In
truth
,
madame
,
*NL*
do
you
think
that
can
be
possible
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir

''
said
Milady
,
``
you
must
be
either
drunk
or
mad
.
Leave
the
*NL*
room
,
and
send
me
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
are
very
indiscreet
,
my
sister

Can
not
I
serve
you
as
a
waiting
*NL*
maid
?
By
that
means
all
our
secrets
will
remain
in
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insolent
!
''
cried
Milady
;
and
as
if
acted
upon
by
a
spring
,
she
bounded
*NL*
toward
the
baron
,
who
awaited
her
attack
with
his
arms
crossed
,
but
*NL*
nevertheless
with
one
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
know
you
are
accustomed
to
assassinate
people
;
but
I
*NL*
warn
you
I
shall
defend
myself
,
even
against
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
Milady
.
``
You
have
all
the
appearance
of
being
*NL*
cowardly
enough
to
lift
your
hand
against
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
;
and
I
have
an
excuse

for
mine
would
not
be
the
first
hand
*NL*
of
a
man
that
has
been
placed
upon
you
,
I
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
baron
pointed
,
with
a
slow
and
accusing
gesture
,
to
the
left
*NL*
shoulder
of
Milady
,
which
he
almost
touched
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
uttered
a
deep
,
inward
shriek
,
and
retreated
to
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
like
a
panther
which
crouches
for
a
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
growl
as
much
as
you
please
,
''
cried
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
but
do
n't
try
*NL*
to
bite
,
for
I
warn
you
that
it
would
be
to
your
disadvantage

There
are
*NL*
here
no
procurators
who
regulate
successions
beforehand
.
There
is
no
*NL*
knight-errant
to
come
and
seek
a
quarrel
with
me
on
account
of
the
fair
*NL*
lady
I
detain
a
prisoner
;
but
I
have
judges
quite
ready
who
will
quickly
*NL*
dispose
of
a
woman
so
shameless
as
to
glide
,
a
bigamist
,
into
the
bed
of
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
,
my
brother
.
And
these
judges
,
I
warn
you
,
will
soon
send
*NL*
you
to
an
executioner
who
will
make
both
your
shoulders
alike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
Milady
darted
such
flashes
that
although
he
was
a
man
and
*NL*
armed
before
an
unarmed
woman
,
he
felt
the
chill
of
fear
glide
through
*NL*
his
whole
frame
.
However
,
he
continued
all
the
same
,
but
with
increasing
*NL*
warmth
:
``
Yes
,
I
can
very
well
understand
that
after
having
inherited
the
*NL*
fortune
of
my
brother
it
would
be
very
agreeable
to
you
to
be
my
heir
*NL*
likewise
;
but
know
beforehand
,
if
you
kill
me
or
cause
me
to
be
killed
,
*NL*
my
precautions
are
taken
.
Not
a
penny
of
what
I
possess
will
pass
into
*NL*
your
hands
.
Were
you
not
already
rich
enough
--
you
who
possess
nearly
a
*NL*
million
?
And
could
you
not
stop
your
fatal
career
,
if
you
did
not
do
*NL*
evil
for
the
infinite
and
supreme
joy
of
doing
it
?
Oh
,
be
assured
,
if
*NL*
the
memory
of
my
brother
were
not
sacred
to
me
,
you
should
rot
in
a
*NL*
state
dungeon
or
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
sailors
at
Tyburn
.
I
will
be
*NL*
silent
,
but
you
must
endure
your
captivity
quietly
.
In
fifteen
or
twenty
*NL*
days
I
shall
set
out
for
La
Rochelle
with
the
army
;
but
on
the
eve
of
my
*NL*
departure
a
vessel
which
I
shall
see
depart
will
take
you
hence
and
*NL*
convey
you
to
our
colonies
in
the
south
.
And
be
assured
that
you
shall
*NL*
be
accompanied
by
one
who
will
blow
your
brains
out
at
the
first
attempt
*NL*
you
make
to
return
to
England
or
the
Continent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
listened
with
an
attention
that
dilated
her
inflamed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
at
present
,
''
continued
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
you
will
remain
in
this
*NL*
castle
.
The
walls
are
thick
,
the
doors
strong
,
and
the
bars
solid
;
*NL*
besides
,
your
window
opens
immediately
over
the
sea
.
The
men
of
my
crew
,
*NL*
who
are
devoted
to
me
for
life
and
death
,
mount
guard
around
this
*NL*
apartment
,
and
watch
all
the
passages
that
lead
to
the
courtyard
.
Even
*NL*
if
you
gained
the
yard
,
there
would
still
be
three
iron
gates
for
you
to
*NL*
pass
.
The
order
is
positive
.
A
step
,
a
gesture
,
a
word
,
on
your
part
,
*NL*
denoting
an
effort
to
escape
,
and
you
are
to
be
fired
upon
.
If
they
kill
*NL*
you
,
English
justice
will
be
under
an
obligation
to
me
for
having
saved
*NL*
it
trouble
.
Ah
!
I
see
your
features
regain
their
calmness
,
your
*NL*
countenance
recovers
its
assurance
.
You
are
saying
to
yourself
:
`
Fifteen
*NL*
days
,
twenty
days
?
Bah
!
I
have
an
inventive
mind
;
before
that
is
expired
*NL*
some
idea
will
occur
to
me
.
I
have
an
infernal
spirit
.
I
shall
meet
with
*NL*
a
victim
.
Before
fifteen
days
are
gone
by
I
shall
be
away
from
here
.
'
*NL*
Ah
,
try
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
finding
her
thoughts
betrayed
,
dug
her
nails
into
her
flesh
to
*NL*
subdue
every
emotion
that
might
give
to
her
face
any
expression
except
*NL*
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
continued
:
``
The
officer
who
commands
here
in
my
absence
*NL*
you
have
already
seen
,
and
therefore
know
him
.
He
knows
how
,
as
you
must
*NL*
have
observed
,
to
obey
an
order
--
for
you
did
not
,
I
am
sure
,
come
from
*NL*
Portsmouth
hither
without
endeavoring
to
make
him
speak
.
What
do
you
say
*NL*
of
him
?
Could
a
statue
of
marble
have
been
more
impassive
and
more
mute
?
*NL*
You
have
already
tried
the
power
of
your
seductions
upon
many
men
,
and
*NL*
unfortunately
you
have
always
succeeded
;
but
I
give
you
leave
to
try
*NL*
them
upon
this
one
.
PARDIEU
!
if
you
succeed
with
him
,
I
pronounce
you
*NL*
the
demon
himself

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
toward
the
door
and
opened
it
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
Mr.
Felton

said
he
.
``
Wait
a
minute
longer
,
and
I
will
introduce
*NL*
him
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
There
followed
between
these
two
personages
a
strange
silence
,
during
*NL*
which
the
sound
of
a
slow
and
regular
step
was
heard
approaching
.
*NL*
Shortly
a
human
form
appeared
in
the
shade
of
the
corridor
,
and
the
*NL*
young
lieutenant
,
with
whom
we
are
already
acquainted
,
stopped
at
the
*NL*
threshold
to
receive
the
orders
of
the
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
my
dear
John

''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
come
in
,
and
shut
the
*NL*
door

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
baron
,
``
look
at
this
woman

She
is
young
;
she
is
*NL*
beautiful
;
she
possesses
all
earthly
seductions

Well
,
she
is
a
monster
,
*NL*
who
,
at
twenty-five
years
of
age
,
has
been
guilty
of
as
many
crimes
as
*NL*
you
could
read
of
in
a
year
in
the
archives
of
our
tribunals
.
Her
voice
*NL*
prejudices
her
hearers
in
her
favor
;
her
beauty
serves
as
a
bait
to
her
*NL*
victims
;
her
body
even
pays
what
she
promises
--
I
must
do
her
that
*NL*
justice
.
She
will
try
to
seduce
you
,
perhaps
she
will
try
to
kill
you
.
I
*NL*
have
extricated
you
from
misery
,
Felton
;
I
have
caused
you
to
be
named
*NL*
lieutenant

I
once
saved
your

you
know
on
what
occasion

I
am
for
*NL*
you
not
only
a
protector

but
a
friend

not
only
a
benefactor
,
but
a
*NL*
father

This
woman
has
come
back
again
into
England
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
conspiring
against
my
life

I
hold
this
serpent
in
my
hands

Well
,
I
*NL*
call
you
,
and
say
to
you
:
Friend
Felton
,
John
,
my
child
,
guard
me
,
and
*NL*
more
particularly
guard
yourself
,
against
this
woman

Swear
,
by
your
*NL*
hopes
of
salvation
,
to
keep
her
safely
for
the
chastisement
she
has
*NL*
merited
.
John
Felton
,
I
trust
your
word

John
Felton
,
I
put
faith
in
*NL*
your
loyalty

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord

''
said
the
young
officer
,
summoning
to
his
mild
countenance
all
*NL*
the
hatred
he
could
find
in
his
heart
,
``
my
Lord
,
I
swear
all
shall
be
*NL*
done
as
you
desire

''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
received
this
look
like
a
resigned
victim
;
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
imagine
a
more
submissive
or
a
more
mild
expression
than
that
which
*NL*
prevailed
on
her
beautiful
countenance
.
Lord
de
Winter
himself
could
*NL*
scarcely
recognize
the
tigress
who
,
a
minute
before
,
prepared
apparently
*NL*
for
a
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
to
leave
this
chamber
,
understand
,
John
,
''
continued
the
*NL*
baron
.
``
She
is
to
correspond
with
nobody
;
she
is
to
speak
to
no
one
but
*NL*
you

if
you
will
do
her
the
honor
to
address
a
word
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
sufficient
,
my
Lord

I
have
sworn

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
madame

try
to
make
your
peace
with
God

are
judged
by

''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
let
her
head
sink
,
as
if
crushed
by
this
sentence
.
Lord
de
Winter
*NL*
went
out
,
making
a
sign
to
Felton
,
who
followed
him
,
shutting
the
door
*NL*
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
instant
after
,
the
heavy
step
of
a
marine
who
served
as
sentinel
was
*NL*
heard
in
the
corridor
--
his
ax
in
his
girdle
and
his
musket
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
remained
for
some
minutes
in
the
same
position
,
for
she
thought
*NL*
they
might
perhaps
be
examining
her
through
the
keyhole
;
she
then
slowly
*NL*
raised
her
head
,
which
had
resumed
its
formidable
expression
of
menace
*NL*
and
defiance
,
ran
to
the
door
to
listen
,
looked
out
of
her
window
,
and
*NL*
returning
to
bury
herself
again
in
her
large
armchair
,
she
reflected

Meanwhile
,
the
cardinal
looked
anxiously
for
news
from
England
;
but
no
*NL*
news
arrived
that
was
not
annoying
and
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
La
Rochelle
was
invested
,
however
certain
success
might
*NL*
appear
--
thanks
to
the
precautions
taken
,
and
above
all
to
the
dyke
,
*NL*
which
prevented
the
entrance
of
any
vessel
into
the
besieged
city
--
the
*NL*
blockade
might
last
a
long
time
yet
.
This
was
a
great
affront
to
the
*NL*
king
's
army
,
and
a
great
inconvenience
to
the
cardinal
,
who
had
no
*NL*
longer
,
it
is
true
,
to
embroil
Louis
XIII
with
Anne
of
Austria
--
for
that
*NL*
affair
was
over
--
but
he
had
to
adjust
matters
for
M.
de
Bassompierre
,
*NL*
who
was
embroiled
with
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Monsieur
,
who
had
begun
the
siege
,
he
left
to
the
cardinal
the
*NL*
task
of
finishing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
city
,
notwithstanding
the
incredible
perseverance
of
its
mayor
,
had
*NL*
attempted
a
sort
of
mutiny
for
a
surrender
;
the
mayor
had
hanged
the
*NL*
mutineers
.
This
execution
quieted
the
ill-disposed
,
who
resolved
to
*NL*
allow
themselves
to
die
of
hunger
--
this
death
always
appearing
to
them
*NL*
more
slow
and
less
sure
than
strangulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
side
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
besiegers
took
the
messengers
*NL*
which
the
Rochellais
sent
to
Buckingham
,
or
the
spies
which
Buckingham
*NL*
sent
to
the
Rochellais
.
In
one
case
or
the
other
,
the
trial
was
soon
*NL*
over
.
The
cardinal
pronounced
the
single
word
,
``
Hanged
!
''
The
king
was
*NL*
invited
to
come
and
see
the
hanging
.
He
came
languidly
,
placing
himself
*NL*
in
a
good
situation
to
see
all
the
details
.
This
amused
him
sometimes
a
*NL*
little
,
and
made
him
endure
the
siege
with
patience
;
but
it
did
not
*NL*
prevent
his
getting
very
tired
,
or
from
talking
at
every
moment
of
*NL*
returning
to
Paris
--
so
that
if
the
messengers
and
the
spies
had
failed
,
*NL*
his
Eminence
,
notwithstanding
all
his
inventiveness
,
would
have
found
*NL*
himself
much
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
time
passed
on
,
and
the
Rochellais
did
not
surrender
.
The
*NL*
last
spy
that
was
taken
was
the
bearer
of
a
letter
.
This
letter
told
*NL*
Buckingham
that
the
city
was
at
an
extremity
;
but
instead
of
adding
,
``
If
*NL*
your
succor
does
not
arrive
within
fifteen
days
,
we
will
surrender
,
''
it
*NL*
added
,
quite
simply
,
``
If
your
succor
comes
not
within
fifteen
days
,
we
*NL*
shall
all
be
dead
with
hunger
when
it
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rochellais
,
then
,
had
no
hope
but
in
Buckingham
.
Buckingham
was
*NL*
their
Messiah
.
It
was
evident
that
if
they
one
day
learned
positively
*NL*
that
they
must
not
count
on
Buckingham
,
their
courage
would
fail
with
*NL*
their
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
looked
,
then
,
with
great
impatience
for
the
news
from
*NL*
England
which
would
announce
to
him
that
Buckingham
would
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
of
carrying
the
city
by
assault
,
though
often
debated
in
*NL*
the
council
of
the
king
,
had
been
always
rejected
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
La
Rochelle
appeared
impregnable
.
Then
the
cardinal
,
whatever
he
said
,
*NL*
very
well
knew
that
the
horror
of
bloodshed
in
this
encounter
,
in
which
*NL*
Frenchman
would
combat
against
Frenchman
,
was
a
retrograde
movement
of
*NL*
sixty
years
impressed
upon
his
policy
;
and
the
cardinal
was
at
that
*NL*
period
what
we
now
call
a
man
of
progress
.
In
fact
,
the
sack
of
La
*NL*
Rochelle
,
and
the
assassination
of
three
of
four
thousand
Huguenots
who
*NL*
allowed
themselves
to
be
killed
,
would
resemble
too
closely
,
in
1628
,
*NL*
the
massacre
of
St.
Bartholomew
in
1572
;
and
then
,
above
all
this
,
this
*NL*
extreme
measure
,
which
was
not
at
all
repugnant
to
the
king
,
good
*NL*
Catholic
as
he
was
,
always
fell
before
this
argument
of
the
besieging
*NL*
generals
--
La
Rochelle
is
impregnable
except
to
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
could
not
drive
from
his
mind
the
fear
he
entertained
of
*NL*
his
terrible
emissary
--
for
he
comprehended
the
strange
qualities
of
this
*NL*
woman
,
sometimes
a
serpent
,
sometimes
a
lion
.
Had
she
betrayed
him
?
Was
*NL*
she
dead
?
He
knew
her
well
enough
in
all
cases
to
know
that
,
whether
*NL*
acting
for
or
against
him
,
as
a
friend
or
an
enemy
,
she
would
not
remain
*NL*
motionless
without
great
impediments
;
but
whence
did
these
impediments
*NL*
arise
?
That
was
what
he
could
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
reckoned
,
and
with
reason
,
on
Milady
.
He
had
divined
in
the
*NL*
past
of
this
woman
terrible
things
which
his
red
mantle
alone
could
*NL*
cover
;
and
he
felt
,
from
one
cause
or
another
,
that
this
woman
was
his
*NL*
own
,
as
she
could
look
to
no
other
but
himself
for
a
support
superior
to
*NL*
the
danger
which
threatened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resolved
,
then
,
to
carry
on
the
war
alone
,
and
to
look
for
no
success
*NL*
foreign
to
himself
,
but
as
we
look
for
a
fortunate
chance
.
He
continued
*NL*
to
press
the
raising
of
the
famous
dyke
which
was
to
starve
La
Rochelle
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
he
cast
his
eyes
over
that
unfortunate
city
,
which
contained
*NL*
so
much
deep
misery
and
so
many
heroic
virtues
,
and
recalling
the
saying
*NL*
of
Louis
XI
,
his
political
predecessor
,
as
he
himself
was
the
*NL*
predecessor
of
Robespierre
,
he
repeated
this
maxim
of
Tristan
's
gossip
:
*NL*
``
Divide
in
order
to
reign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
IV
,
when
besieging
Paris
,
had
loaves
and
provisions
thrown
over
*NL*
the
walls
.
The
cardinal
had
little
notes
thrown
over
in
which
he
*NL*
represented
to
the
Rochellais
how
unjust
,
selfish
,
and
barbarous
was
the
*NL*
conduct
of
their
leaders
.
These
leaders
had
corn
in
abundance
,
and
would
*NL*
not
let
them
partake
of
it
;
they
adopted
as
a
maxim
--
for
they
,
too
,
had
*NL*
maxims
--
that
it
was
of
very
little
consequence
that
women
,
children
,
and
*NL*
old
men
should
die
,
so
long
as
the
men
who
were
to
defend
the
walls
*NL*
remained
strong
and
healthy
.
Up
to
that
time
,
whether
from
devotedness
*NL*
or
from
want
of
power
to
act
against
it
,
this
maxim
,
without
being
*NL*
generally
adopted
,
nevertheless
passed
from
theory
into
practice
;
but
*NL*
the
notes
did
it
injury
.
The
notes
reminded
the
men
that
the
children
,
*NL*
women
,
and
old
men
whom
they
allowed
to
die
were
their
sons
,
their
*NL*
wives
,
and
their
fathers
,
and
that
it
would
be
more
just
for
everyone
to
*NL*
be
reduced
to
the
common
misery
,
in
order
that
equal
conditions
should
*NL*
give
birth
to
unanimous
resolutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
notes
had
all
the
effect
that
he
who
wrote
them
could
expect
,
in
*NL*
that
they
induced
a
great
number
of
the
inhabitants
to
open
private
*NL*
negotiations
with
the
royal
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
when
the
cardinal
saw
his
means
already
bearing
fruit
,
*NL*
and
applauded
himself
for
having
put
it
in
action
,
an
inhabitant
of
La
*NL*
Rochelle
who
had
contrived
to
pass
the
royal
lines
--
God
knows
how
,
such
*NL*
was
the
watchfulness
of
Bassompierre
,
Schomberg
,
and
the
Duc
*NL*
d'Angouleme
,
themselves
watched
over
by
the
cardinal
--
an
inhabitant
of
*NL*
La
Rochelle
,
we
say
,
entered
the
city
,
coming
from
Portsmouth
,
and
*NL*
saying
that
he
had
seen
a
magnificent
fleet
ready
to
sail
within
eight
*NL*
days
.
Still
further
,
Buckingham
announced
to
the
mayor
that
at
length
*NL*
the
great
league
was
about
to
declare
itself
against
France
,
and
that
*NL*
the
kingdom
would
be
at
once
invaded
by
the
English
,
Imperial
,
and
*NL*
Spanish
armies
.
This
letter
was
read
publicly
in
all
parts
of
the
city
.
*NL*
Copies
were
put
up
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
;
and
even
they
who
had
*NL*
begun
to
open
negotiations
interrupted
them
,
being
resolved
to
await
the
*NL*
succor
so
pompously
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
circumstance
brought
back
Richelieu
's
former
anxiety
,
*NL*
and
forced
him
in
spite
of
himself
once
more
to
turn
his
eyes
to
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
,
exempt
from
the
anxiety
of
its
only
and
true
chief
,
*NL*
the
royal
army
led
a
joyous
life
,
neither
provisions
nor
money
being
*NL*
wanting
in
the
camp
.
All
the
corps
rivaled
one
another
in
audacity
and
*NL*
gaiety
.
To
take
spies
and
hang
them
,
to
make
hazardous
expeditions
upon
*NL*
the
dyke
or
the
sea
,
to
imagine
wild
plans
,
and
to
execute
them
*NL*
coolly
--
such
were
the
pastimes
which
made
the
army
find
these
days
short
*NL*
which
were
not
only
so
long
to
the
Rochellais
,
a
prey
to
famine
and
*NL*
anxiety
,
but
even
to
the
cardinal
,
who
blockaded
them
so
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
when
the
cardinal
,
always
on
horseback
,
like
the
lowest
*NL*
GENDARME
of
the
army
,
cast
a
pensive
glance
over
those
works
,
so
slowly
*NL*
keeping
pace
with
his
wishes
,
which
the
engineers
,
brought
from
all
the
*NL*
corners
of
France
,
were
executing
under
his
orders
,
if
he
met
a
*NL*
Musketeer
of
the
company
of
Treville
,
he
drew
near
and
looked
at
him
in
*NL*
a
peculiar
manner
,
and
not
recognizing
in
him
one
of
our
four
*NL*
companions
,
he
turned
his
penetrating
look
and
profound
thoughts
in
*NL*
another
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
oppressed
with
a
mortal
weariness
of
mind
,
without
hope
in
*NL*
the
negotiations
with
the
city
,
without
news
from
England
,
the
cardinal
*NL*
went
out
,
without
any
other
aim
than
to
be
out
of
doors
,
and
accompanied
*NL*
only
by
Cahusac
and
La
Houdiniere
,
strolled
along
the
beach
.
Mingling
*NL*
the
immensity
of
his
dreams
with
the
immensity
of
the
ocean
,
he
came
,
*NL*
his
horse
going
at
a
foot
's
pace
,
to
a
hill
from
the
top
of
which
he
*NL*
perceived
behind
a
hedge
,
reclining
on
the
sand
and
catching
in
its
*NL*
passage
one
of
those
rays
of
the
sun
so
rare
at
this
period
of
the
year
,
*NL*
seven
men
surrounded
by
empty
bottles
.
Four
of
these
men
were
our
*NL*
Musketeers
,
preparing
to
listen
to
a
letter
one
of
them
had
just
*NL*
received
.
This
letter
was
so
important
that
it
made
them
forsake
their
*NL*
cards
and
their
dice
on
the
drumhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
three
were
occupied
in
opening
an
enormous
flagon
of
Collicure
*NL*
wine
;
these
were
the
lackeys
of
these
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
in
very
low
spirits
;
and
nothing
when
*NL*
he
was
in
that
state
of
mind
increased
his
depression
so
much
as
gaiety
*NL*
in
others
.
Besides
,
he
had
another
strange
fancy
,
which
was
always
to
*NL*
believe
that
the
causes
of
his
sadness
created
the
gaiety
of
others
.
*NL*
Making
a
sign
to
La
Houdiniere
and
Cahusac
to
stop
,
he
alighted
from
his
*NL*
horse
,
and
went
toward
these
suspected
merry
companions
,
hoping
,
by
*NL*
means
of
the
sand
which
deadened
the
sound
of
his
steps
and
of
the
hedge
*NL*
which
concealed
his
approach
,
to
catch
some
words
of
this
conversation
*NL*
which
appeared
so
interesting
.
At
ten
paces
from
the
hedge
he
recognized
*NL*
the
talkative
Gascon
;
and
as
he
had
already
perceived
that
these
men
*NL*
were
Musketeers
,
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
three
others
were
those
*NL*
called
the
Inseparables
;
that
is
to
say
,
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
supposed
that
his
desire
to
hear
the
conversation
was
*NL*
augmented
by
this
discovery
.
His
eyes
took
a
strange
expression
,
and
*NL*
with
the
step
of
a
tiger-cat
he
advanced
toward
the
hedge
;
but
he
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
catch
more
than
a
few
vague
syllables
without
any
*NL*
positive
sense
,
when
a
sonorous
and
short
cry
made
him
start
,
and
*NL*
attracted
the
attention
of
the
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Officer
!
''
cried
Grimaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
speaking
,
you
scoundrel
!
''
said
Athos
,
rising
upon
his
elbow
,
*NL*
and
transfixing
Grimaud
with
his
flaming
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
therefore
added
nothing
to
his
speech
,
but
contented
himself
*NL*
with
pointing
his
index
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
hedge
,
announcing
*NL*
by
this
gesture
the
cardinal
and
his
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
single
bound
the
Musketeers
were
on
their
feet
,
and
saluted
with
*NL*
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
seemed
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
Messieurs
the
Musketeers
keep
guard
,
''
said
he
.
``
Are
the
*NL*
English
expected
by
land
,
or
do
the
Musketeers
consider
themselves
*NL*
superior
officers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
replied
Athos
,
for
amid
the
general
fright
he
alone
had
*NL*
preserved
the
noble
calmness
and
coolness
that
never
forsook
him
,
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
the
Musketeers
,
when
they
are
not
on
duty
,
or
when
their
*NL*
duty
is
over
,
drink
and
play
at
dice
,
and
they
are
certainly
superior
*NL*
officers
to
their
lackeys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lackeys
?
''
grumbled
the
cardinal
.
``
Lackeys
who
have
the
order
to
warn
*NL*
their
masters
when
anyone
passes
are
not
lackeys
,
they
are
sentinels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Eminence
may
perceive
that
if
we
had
not
taken
this
precaution
,
we
*NL*
should
have
been
exposed
to
allowing
you
to
pass
without
presenting
you
*NL*
our
respects
or
offering
you
our
thanks
for
the
favor
you
have
done
us
*NL*
in
uniting
us
.
D'Artagnan
,
''
continued
Athos
,
``
you
,
who
but
lately
were
*NL*
so
anxious
for
such
an
opportunity
for
expressing
your
gratitude
to
*NL*
Monseigneur
,
here
it
is
;
avail
yourself
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
pronounced
with
that
imperturbable
phlegm
which
*NL*
distinguished
Athos
in
the
hour
of
danger
,
and
with
that
excessive
*NL*
politeness
which
made
of
him
at
certain
moments
a
king
more
majestic
*NL*
than
kings
by
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
came
forward
and
stammered
out
a
few
words
of
gratitude
which
*NL*
soon
expired
under
the
gloomy
looks
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
signify
,
gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
cardinal
,
without
*NL*
appearing
to
be
in
the
least
swerved
from
his
first
intention
by
the
*NL*
diversion
which
Athos
had
started
,
``
it
does
not
signify
,
gentlemen
.
I
do
*NL*
not
like
to
have
simple
soldiers
,
because
they
have
the
advantage
of
*NL*
serving
in
a
privileged
corps
,
thus
to
play
the
great
lords
;
discipline
*NL*
is
the
same
for
them
as
for
everybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
allowed
the
cardinal
to
finish
his
sentence
completely
,
and
bowed
*NL*
in
sign
of
assent
.
Then
he
resumed
in
his
turn
:
``
Discipline
,
*NL*
Monseigneur
,
has
,
I
hope
,
in
no
way
been
forgotten
by
us
.
We
are
not
on
*NL*
duty
,
and
we
believed
that
not
being
on
duty
we
were
at
liberty
to
*NL*
dispose
of
our
time
as
we
pleased
.
If
we
are
so
fortunate
as
to
have
*NL*
some
particular
duty
to
perform
for
your
Eminence
,
we
are
ready
to
obey
*NL*
you
.
Your
Eminence
may
perceive
,
''
continued
Athos
,
knitting
his
brow
,
*NL*
for
this
sort
of
investigation
began
to
annoy
him
,
``
that
we
have
not
*NL*
come
out
without
our
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
showed
the
cardinal
,
with
his
finger
,
the
four
muskets
piled
near
*NL*
the
drum
,
on
which
were
the
cards
and
dice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Eminence
may
believe
,
''
added
d'Artagnan
,
``
that
we
would
have
come
*NL*
to
meet
you
,
if
we
could
have
supposed
it
was
Monseigneur
coming
toward
*NL*
us
with
so
few
attendants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
bit
his
mustache
,
and
even
his
lips
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
you
look
like
,
all
together
,
as
you
are
armed
and
*NL*
guarded
by
your
lackeys
?
''
said
the
cardinal
.
``
You
look
like
four
*NL*
conspirators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
as
to
that
,
Monseigneur
,
it
is
true
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
we
do
conspire
,
*NL*
as
your
Eminence
might
have
seen
the
other
morning
.
Only
we
conspire
*NL*
against
the
Rochellais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
gentlemen
of
policy
!
''
replied
the
cardinal
,
knitting
his
brow
*NL*
in
his
turn
,
``
the
secret
of
many
unknown
things
might
perhaps
be
found
*NL*
in
your
brains
,
if
we
could
read
them
as
you
read
that
letter
which
you
*NL*
concealed
as
soon
as
you
saw
me
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
color
mounted
to
the
face
of
Athos
,
and
he
made
a
step
toward
his
*NL*
Eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
think
you
really
suspected
us
,
monseigneur
,
and
we
were
*NL*
undergoing
a
real
interrogatory
.
If
it
be
so
,
we
trust
your
Eminence
*NL*
will
deign
to
explain
yourself
,
and
we
should
then
at
least
be
*NL*
acquainted
with
our
real
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
were
an
interrogatory
!
''
replied
the
cardinal
.
``
Others
besides
*NL*
you
have
undergone
such
,
Monsieur
Athos
,
and
have
replied
thereto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
I
have
told
your
Eminence
that
you
had
but
to
question
us
,
and
we
*NL*
are
ready
to
reply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
that
letter
you
were
about
to
read
,
Monsieur
Aramis
,
and
which
*NL*
you
so
promptly
concealed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
's
letter
,
monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
I
see
,
''
said
the
cardinal
;
``
we
must
be
discreet
with
this
sort
*NL*
of
letters
;
but
nevertheless
,
we
may
show
them
to
a
confessor
,
and
you
*NL*
know
I
have
taken
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
Athos
,
with
a
calmness
the
more
terrible
because
he
*NL*
risked
his
head
in
making
this
reply
,
``
the
letter
is
a
woman
's
letter
,
*NL*
but
it
is
neither
signed
Marion
de
Lorme
,
nor
Madame
d'Aiguillon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
became
as
pale
as
death
;
lightning
darted
from
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
turned
round
as
if
to
give
an
order
to
Cahusac
and
Houdiniere
.
Athos
saw
*NL*
the
movement
;
he
made
a
step
toward
the
muskets
,
upon
which
the
other
*NL*
three
friends
had
fixed
their
eyes
,
like
men
ill-disposed
to
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
taken
.
The
cardinalists
were
three
;
the
Musketeers
,
*NL*
lackeys
included
,
were
seven
.
He
judged
that
the
match
would
be
so
much
*NL*
the
less
equal
,
if
Athos
and
his
companions
were
really
plotting
;
and
by
*NL*
one
of
those
rapid
turns
which
he
always
had
at
command
,
all
his
anger
*NL*
faded
away
into
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
he
,
``
you
are
brave
young
men
,
proud
in
daylight
,
*NL*
faithful
in
darkness
.
We
can
find
no
fault
with
you
for
watching
over
*NL*
yourselves
,
when
you
watch
so
carefully
over
others
.
Gentlemen
,
I
have
*NL*
not
forgotten
the
night
in
which
you
served
me
as
an
escort
to
the
Red
*NL*
Dovecot
.
If
there
were
any
danger
to
be
apprehended
on
the
road
I
am
*NL*
going
,
I
would
request
you
to
accompany
me
;
but
as
there
is
none
,
remain
*NL*
where
you
are
,
finish
your
bottles
,
your
game
,
and
your
letter
.
Adieu
,
*NL*
gentlemen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
remounting
his
horse
,
which
Cahusac
led
to
him
,
he
saluted
them
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
rode
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
young
men
,
standing
and
motionless
,
followed
him
with
their
*NL*
eyes
without
speaking
a
single
word
until
he
had
disappeared
.
Then
they
*NL*
looked
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countenances
of
all
gave
evidence
of
terror
,
for
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
friendly
adieu
of
his
Eminence
,
they
plainly
perceived
that
the
cardinal
*NL*
went
away
with
rage
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
alone
smiled
,
with
a
self-possessed
,
disdainful
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cardinal
was
out
of
hearing
and
sight
,
``
That
Grimaud
kept
bad
*NL*
watch
!
''
cried
Porthos
,
who
had
a
great
inclination
to
vent
his
ill-humor
*NL*
on
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
was
about
to
reply
to
excuse
himself
.
Athos
lifted
his
finger
,
*NL*
and
Grimaud
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
have
given
up
the
letter
,
Aramis
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Aramis
,
in
his
most
flutelike
tone
,
``
I
had
made
up
my
mind
.
If
*NL*
he
had
insisted
upon
the
letter
being
given
up
to
him
,
I
would
have
*NL*
presented
the
letter
to
him
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
I
would
*NL*
have
run
my
sword
through
his
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
as
much
,
''
said
Athos
;
``
and
that
was
why
I
threw
myself
*NL*
between
you
and
him
.
Indeed
,
this
man
is
very
much
to
blame
for
talking
*NL*
thus
to
other
men
;
one
would
say
he
had
never
had
to
do
with
any
but
*NL*
women
and
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Athos
,
I
admire
you
,
but
nevertheless
we
were
in
the
wrong
,
*NL*
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
in
the
wrong
?
''
said
Athos
.
``
Whose
,
then
,
is
the
air
we
breathe
?
*NL*
Whose
is
the
ocean
upon
which
we
look

Whose
is
the
sand
upon
which
we
*NL*
were
reclining
?
Whose
is
that
letter
of
your
mistress
?
Do
these
belong
*NL*
to
the
cardinal
?
Upon
my
honor
,
this
man
fancies
the
world
belongs
to
*NL*
him
.
There
you
stood
,
stammering
,
stupefied
,
annihilated
.
One
might
have
*NL*
supposed
the
Bastille
appeared
before
you
,
and
that
the
gigantic
Medusa
*NL*
had
converted
you
into
stone
.
Is
being
in
love
conspiring
?
You
are
in
*NL*
love
with
a
woman
whom
the
cardinal
has
caused
to
be
shut
up
,
and
you
*NL*
wish
to
get
her
out
of
the
hands
of
the
cardinal
.
That
's
a
match
you
are
*NL*
playing
with
his
Eminence
;
this
letter
is
your
game
.
Why
should
you
*NL*
expose
your
game
to
your
adversary

That
is
never
done
.
Let
him
find
it
*NL*
out
if
he
can
!
We
can
find
out
his
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
very
sensible

Athos

said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that

let
there
be
no

question

past

Aramis
resume
the
letter
from
his
cousin
where
the
cardinal
interrupted
*NL*
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
;
the
three
friends
surrounded
*NL*
him
,
and
the
three
lackeys
grouped
themselves
again
near
the
wine
jar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

only
read
a

two

d'Artagnan

*NL*

My

I

make
up

out

my

has
placed
our
little
servant
in
the
convent
of
the
Carmelites

this
*NL*
poor

is
quite
resigned

as
she
knows
she
can
not
live
elsewhere

the
salvation

in
danger

Nevertheless

if
the

affairs

arranged

as
we
hope
they
will
be

I

she
will
run
the
risk

being
damned

return

as
she
knows

Meanwhile

the
glass
of
Bordeaux
wine
;
but
his
eyes
,
*NL*
raised
toward
heaven
during
this
delicious
occupation
,
spoke
a
language
*NL*
which
,
though
mute
,
was
not
the
less
expressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
unless
Monsieur
Cardinal
should
form
the
*NL*
ingenious
idea
of
ripping
up
Grimaud
,
I
think
we
may
be
pretty
much
at
*NL*
our
ease
respecting
the
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
his
Eminence
continued
his
melancholy
ride
,
murmuring
between
*NL*
his
mustaches
,
``
These
four
men
must
positively
be
mine

CAPTIVITY
:
THE
FIRST
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
Milady
,
whom
a
glance
thrown
upon
the
coast
of
France
*NL*
has
made
us
lose
sight
of
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
find
her
still
in
the
despairing
attitude
in
which
we
left
her
,
*NL*
plunged
in
an
abyss
of
dismal
reflection
--
a
dark
hell
at
the
gate
of
*NL*
which
she
has
almost
left
hope
behind
,
because
for
the
first
time
she
*NL*
doubts
,
for
the
first
time
she
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
two
occasions
her
fortune
has
failed
her
,
on
two
occasions
she
has
*NL*
found
herself
discovered
and
betrayed
;
and
on
these
two
occasions
it
was
*NL*
to
one
fatal
genius
,
sent
doubtlessly
by
the
Lord
to
combat
her
,
that
*NL*
she
has
succumbed
.
D'Artagnan
has
conquered
her
--
her
,
that
invincible
*NL*
power
of
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
deceived
her
in
her
love
,
humbled
her
in
her
pride
,
thwarted
her
*NL*
in
her
ambition
;
and
now
he
ruins
her
fortune
,
deprives
her
of
liberty
,
*NL*
and
even
threatens
her
life
.
Still
more
,
he
has
lifted
the
corner
of
her
*NL*
mask
--
that
shield
with
which
she
covered
herself
and
which
rendered
her
*NL*
so
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
has
turned
aside
from
Buckingham
,
whom
she
hates
as
she
hates
*NL*
everyone
she
has
loved
,
the
tempest
with
which
Richelieu
threatened
him
*NL*
in
the
person
of
the
queen
.
D'Artagnan
had
passed
himself
upon
her
as
de
*NL*
Wardes
,
for
whom
she
had
conceived
one
of
those
tigerlike
fancies
common
*NL*
to
women
of
her
character
.
D'Artagnan
knows
that
terrible
secret
which
*NL*
she
has
sworn
no
one
shall
know
without
dying
.
In
short
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
she
has
just
obtained
from
Richelieu
a
carte
blanche
by
the
*NL*
means
of
which
she
is
about
to
take
vengeance
on
her
enemy
,
this
*NL*
precious
paper
is
torn
from
her
hands
,
and
it
is
d'Artagnan
who
holds
*NL*
her
prisoner
and
is
about
to
send
her
to
some
filthy
Botany
Bay
,
some
*NL*
infamous
Tyburn
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
she
owes
to
d'Artagnan
,
without
doubt
.
From
whom
can
come
so
*NL*
many
disgraces
heaped
upon
her
head
,
if
not
from
him
?
He
alone
could
*NL*
have
transmitted
to
Lord
de
Winter
all
these
frightful
secrets
which
he
*NL*
has
discovered
,
one
after
another
,
by
a
train
of
fatalities
.
He
knows
*NL*
her
brother-in-law
.
He
must
have
written
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
hatred
she
distills
!
Motionless
,
with
her
burning
and
fixed
*NL*
glances
,
in
her
solitary
apartment
,
how
well
the
outbursts
of
passion
*NL*
which
at
times
escape
from
the
depths
of
her
chest
with
her
respiration
,
*NL*
accompany
the
sound
of
the
surf
which
rises
,
growls
,
roars
,
and
breaks
*NL*
itself
like
an
eternal
and
powerless
despair
against
the
rocks
on
which
*NL*
is
built
this
dark
and
lofty
castle
!
How
many
magnificent
projects
of
*NL*
vengeance
she
conceives
by
the
light
of
the
flashes
which
her
*NL*
tempestuous
passion
casts
over
her
mind
against
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
against
*NL*
Buckingham
,
but
above
all
against
d'Artagnan
--
projects
lost
in
the
*NL*
distance
of
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
but
in
order
to
avenge
herself
she
must
be
free
.
And
to
be
free
,
a
*NL*
prisoner
has
to
pierce
a
wall
,
detach
bars
,
cut
through
a
floor
--
all
*NL*
undertakings
which
a
patient
and
strong
man
may
accomplish
,
but
before
*NL*
which
the
feverish
irritations
of
a
woman
must
give
way
.
Besides
,
to
do
*NL*
all
this
,
time
is
necessary
--
months
,
years
;
and
she
has
ten
or
twelve
*NL*
days
,
as
Lord
de
Winter
,
her
fraternal
and
terrible
jailer
,
has
told
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
if
she
were
a
man
she
would
attempt
all
this
,
and
perhaps
might
*NL*
succeed
;
why
,
then
,
did
heaven
make
the
mistake
of
placing
that
manlike
*NL*
soul
in
that
frail
and
delicate
body
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
moments
of
her
captivity
were
terrible
;
a
few
convulsions
of
*NL*
rage
which
she
could
not
suppress
paid
her
debt
of
feminine
weakness
to
*NL*
nature
.
But
by
degrees
she
overcame
the
outbursts
of
her
mad
passion
;
*NL*
and
nervous
tremblings
which
agitated
her
frame
disappeared
,
and
she
*NL*
remained
folded
within
herself
like
a
fatigued
serpent
in
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
,
go
to
!
I
must
have
been
mad
to
allow
myself
to
be
carried
away
*NL*
so
,
''
says
she
,
gazing
into
the
glass
,
which
reflects
back
to
her
eyes
*NL*
the
burning
glance
by
which
she
appears
to
interrogate
herself
.
``
No
*NL*
violence
;
violence
is
the
proof
of
weakness
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
have
*NL*
never
succeeded
by
that
means
.
Perhaps
if
I
employed
my
strength
against
*NL*
women
I
might
perchance
find
them
weaker
than
myself
,
and
consequently
*NL*
conquer
them
;
but
it
is
with
men
that
I
struggle
,
and
I
am
but
a
woman
*NL*
to
them
.
Let
me
fight
like
a
woman
,
then
;
my
strength
is
in
my
*NL*
weakness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
if
to
render
an
account
to
herself
of
the
changes
she
could
*NL*
place
upon
her
countenance
,
so
mobile
and
so
expressive
,
she
made
it
*NL*
take
all
expressions
from
that
of
passionate
anger
,
which
convulsed
her
*NL*
features
,
to
that
of
the
most
sweet
,
most
affectionate
,
and
most
*NL*
seducing
smile
.
Then
her
hair
assumed
successively
,
under
her
skillful
*NL*
hands
,
all
the
undulations
she
thought
might
assist
the
charms
of
her
*NL*
face
.
At
length
she
murmured
,
satisfied
with
herself
,
``
Come
,
nothing
is
*NL*
lost
;
I
am
still
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
nearly
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
Milady
perceived
a
bed
;
*NL*
she
calculated
that
the
repose
of
a
few
hours
would
not
only
refresh
her
*NL*
head
and
her
ideas
,
but
still
further
,
her
complexion
.
A
better
idea
,
*NL*
however
,
came
into
her
mind
before
going
to
bed
.
She
had
heard
something
*NL*
said
about
supper
.
She
had
already
been
an
hour
in
this
apartment
;
they
*NL*
could
not
long
delay
bringing
her
a
repast
.
The
prisoner
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
lose
time
;
and
she
resolved
to
make
that
very
evening
some
attempts
to
*NL*
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
ground
she
had
to
work
upon
,
by
studying
the
*NL*
characters
of
the
men
to
whose
guardianship
she
was
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
appeared
under
the
door
;
this
light
announced
the
reappearance
*NL*
of
her
jailers
.
Milady
,
who
had
arisen
,
threw
herself
quickly
into
the
*NL*
armchair
,
her
head
thrown
back
,
her
beautiful
hair
unbound
and
*NL*
disheveled
,
her
bosom
half
bare
beneath
her
crumpled
lace
,
one
hand
on
*NL*
her
heart
,
and
the
other
hanging
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bolts
were
drawn
;
the
door
groaned
upon
its
hinges
.
Steps
sounded
in
*NL*
the
chamber
,
and
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Place
that
table
there
,
''
said
a
voice
which
the
prisoner
recognized
as
*NL*
that
of
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
was
executed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
bring
lights
,
and
relieve
the
sentinel
,
''
continued
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
double
order
which
the
young
lieutenant
gave
to
the
same
*NL*
individuals
proved
to
Milady
that
her
servants
were
the
same
men
as
her
*NL*
guards
;
that
is
to
say
,
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
's
orders
were
,
for
the
rest
,
executed
with
a
silent
rapidity
that
*NL*
gave
a
good
idea
of
the
way
in
which
he
maintained
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
Felton
,
who
had
not
yet
looked
at
Milady
,
turned
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
he
,
``
she
is
asleep
;
that
's
well
.
When
she
wakes
she
can
*NL*
sup
.
''
And
he
made
some
steps
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
lieutenant
,
''
said
a
soldier
,
less
stoical
than
his
chief
,
and
*NL*
who
had
approached
Milady
,
``
this
woman
is
not
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
not
asleep
!
''
said
Felton
;
``
what
is
she
doing
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
fainted
.
Her
face
is
very
pale
,
and
I
have
listened
in
vain
;
I
*NL*
do
not
hear
her
breathe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
Felton
,
after
having
looked
at
Milady
from
the
*NL*
spot
on
which
he
stood
without
moving
a
step
toward
her
.
``
Go
and
tell
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
that
his
prisoner
has
fainted
--
for
this
event
not
having
*NL*
been
foreseen
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
went
out
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
officer
.
Felton
sat
down
*NL*
upon
an
armchair
which
happened
to
be
near
the
door
,
and
waited
without
*NL*
speaking
a
word
,
without
making
a
gesture
.
Milady
possessed
that
great
*NL*
art
,
so
much
studied
by
women
,
of
looking
through
her
long
eyelashes
*NL*
without
appearing
to
open
the
lids
.
She
perceived
Felton
,
who
sat
with
*NL*
his
back
toward
her
.
She
continued
to
look
at
him
for
nearly
ten
*NL*
minutes
,
and
in
these
ten
minutes
the
immovable
guardian
never
turned
*NL*
round
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
thought
that
Lord
de
Winter
would
come
,
and
by
his
presence
*NL*
give
fresh
strength
to
her
jailer
.
Her
first
trial
was
lost
;
she
acted
*NL*
like
a
woman
who
reckons
up
her
resources
.
As
a
result
she
raised
her
*NL*
head
,
opened
her
eyes
,
and
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
sigh
Felton
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
awake
,
madame
,
''
he
said
;
``
then
I
have
nothing
more
to
do
*NL*
here
.
If
you
want
anything
you
can
ring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
how
I
have
suffered
!
''
said
Milady
,
in
that
*NL*
harmonious
voice
which
,
like
that
of
the
ancient
enchantresses
,
charmed
*NL*
all
whom
she
wished
to
destroy
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
assumed
,
upon
sitting
up
in
the
armchair
,
a
still
more
graceful
*NL*
and
abandoned
position
than
when
she
reclined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
served
,
thus
,
madame
,
three
times
a
day
,
''
said
he
.
``
In
the
*NL*
morning
at
nine
o'clock
,
in
the
day
at
one
o'clock
,
and
in
the
evening
*NL*
at
eight
.
If
that
does
not
suit
you
,
you
can
point
out
what
other
hours
*NL*
you
prefer
,
and
in
this
respect
your
wishes
will
be
complied
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
am
I
to
remain
always
alone
in
this
vast
and
dismal
chamber
?
''
asked
*NL*
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
of
the
neighbourhood
has
been
sent
for
,
who
will
be
tomorrow
at
*NL*
the
castle
,
and
will
return
as
often
as
you
desire
her
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
prisoner
,
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
made
a
slight
bow
,
and
directed
his
steps
toward
the
door
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
he
was
about
to
go
out
,
Lord
de
Winter
appeared
in
the
corridor
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
soldier
who
had
been
sent
to
inform
him
of
the
swoon
of
*NL*
Milady
.
He
held
a
vial
of
salts
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
--
what
is
going
on
here
?
''
said
he
,
in
a
jeering
voice
,
*NL*
on
seeing
the
prisoner
sitting
up
and
Felton
about
to
go
out
.
``
Is
this
*NL*
corpse
come
to
life
already
?
Felton
,
my
lad
,
did
you
not
perceive
that
*NL*
you
were
taken
for
a
novice
,
and
that
the
first
act
was
being
performed
*NL*
of
a
comedy
of
which
we
shall
doubtless
have
the
pleasure
of
following
*NL*
out
all
the
developments
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
,
my
lord
,
''
said
Felton
;
``
but
as
the
prisoner
is
a
woman
,
*NL*
after
all
,
I
wish
to
pay
her
the
attention
that
every
man
of
gentle
*NL*
birth
owes
to
a
woman
,
if
not
on
her
account
,
at
least
on
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
shuddered
through
her
whole
system
.
These
words
of
Felton
's
*NL*
passed
like
ice
through
her
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
replied
de
Winter
,
laughing
,
``
that
beautiful
hair
so
skillfully
*NL*
disheveled
,
that
white
skin
,
and
that
languishing
look
,
have
not
yet
*NL*
seduced
you
,
you
heart
of
stone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
Lord
,
''
replied
the
impassive
young
man
;
``
your
Lordship
may
be
*NL*
assured
that
it
requires
more
than
the
tricks
and
coquetry
of
a
woman
to
*NL*
corrupt
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
my
brave
lieutenant
,
let
us
leave
Milady
to
find
out
*NL*
something
else
,
and
go
to
supper
;
but
be
easy
!
She
has
a
fruitful
*NL*
imagination
,
and
the
second
act
of
the
comedy
will
not
delay
its
steps
*NL*
after
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
these
words
Lord
de
Winter
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
Felton
,
*NL*
and
led
him
out
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
be
a
match
for
you
!
''
murmured
Milady
,
between
her
teeth
;
``
be
*NL*
assured
of
that
,
you
poor
spoiled
monk
,
you
poor
converted
soldier
,
who
*NL*
has
cut
his
uniform
out
of
a
monk
's
frock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
resumed
de
Winter
,
stopping
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
,
*NL*
``
you
must
not
,
Milady
,
let
this
check
take
away
your
appetite
.
Taste
*NL*
that
fowl
and
those
fish
.
On
my
honor
,
they
are
not
poisoned
.
I
have
a
*NL*
very
good
cook
,
and
he
is
not
to
be
my
heir
;
I
have
full
and
perfect
*NL*
confidence
in
him
.
Do
as
I
do
.
Adieu
,
dear
sister
,
till
your
next
*NL*
swoon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
that
Milady
could
endure
.
Her
hands
clutched
her
armchair
;
*NL*
she
ground
her
teeth
inwardly
;
her
eyes
followed
the
motion
of
the
door
*NL*
as
it
closed
behind
Lord
de
Winter
and
Felton
,
and
the
moment
she
was
*NL*
alone
a
fresh
fit
of
despair
seized
her
.
She
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
saw
the
glittering
of
a
knife
,
rushed
toward
it
and
clutched
it
;
*NL*
but
her
disappointment
was
cruel
.
The
blade
was
round
,
and
of
flexible
*NL*
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
burst
of
laughter
resounded
from
the
other
side
of
the
ill-closed
*NL*
door
,
and
the
door
reopened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
!
''
cried
Lord
de
Winter
;
``
ha
,
ha
!
Do
n't
you
see
,
my
brave
Felton
;
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
what
I
told
you
?
That
knife
was
for
you
,
my
lad
;
she
would
*NL*
have
killed
you
.
Observe
,
this
is
one
of
her
peculiarities
,
to
get
rid
*NL*
thus
,
after
one
fashion
or
another
,
of
all
the
people
who
bother
her
.
If
*NL*
I
had
listened
to
you
,
the
knife
would
have
been
pointed
and
of
steel
.
*NL*
Then
no
more
of
Felton
;
she
would
have
cut
your
throat
,
and
after
that
*NL*
everybody
else
's
.
See
,
John
,
see
how
well
she
knows
how
to
handle
a
*NL*
knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
Milady
still
held
the
harmless
weapon
in
her
clenched
hand
;
but
*NL*
these
last
words
,
this
supreme
insult
,
relaxed
her
hands
,
her
strength
,
*NL*
and
even
her
will
.
The
knife
fell
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
right
,
my
Lord
,
''
said
Felton
,
with
a
tone
of
profound
disgust
*NL*
which
sounded
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
heart
of
Milady
,
``
you
were
*NL*
right
,
my
Lord
,
and
I
was
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
both
again
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
Milady
lent
a
more
attentive
ear
than
the
first
,
and
she
*NL*
heard
their
steps
die
away
in
the
distance
of
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lost
,
''
murmured
she
;
``
I
am
lost
!
I
am
in
the
power
of
men
upon
*NL*
whom
I
can
have
no
more
influence
than
upon
statues
of
bronze
or
*NL*
granite
;
they
know
me
by
heart
,
and
are
steeled
against
all
my
weapons
.
*NL*
It
is
,
however
,
impossible
that
this
should
end
as
they
have
decreed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
as
this
last
reflection
indicated
--
this
instinctive
return
to
*NL*
hope
--
sentiments
of
weakness
or
fear
did
not
dwell
long
in
her
ardent
*NL*
spirit
.
Milady
sat
down
to
table
,
ate
from
several
dishes
,
drank
a
*NL*
little
Spanish
wine
,
and
felt
all
her
resolution
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
went
to
bed
she
had
pondered
,
analyzed
,
turned
on
all
sides
,
*NL*
examined
on
all
points
,
the
words
,
the
steps
,
the
gestures
,
the
signs
,
*NL*
and
even
the
silence
of
her
interlocutors
;
and
of
this
profound
,
*NL*
skillful
,
and
anxious
study
the
result
was
that
Felton
,
everything
*NL*
considered
,
appeared
the
more
vulnerable
of
her
two
persecutors
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
expression
above
all
recurred
to
the
mind
of
the
prisoner
:
``
If
I
had
*NL*
listened
to
you
,
''
Lord
de
Winter
had
said
to
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
,
then
,
had
spoken
in
her
favor
,
since
Lord
de
Winter
had
not
been
*NL*
willing
to
listen
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weak
or
strong
,
''
repeated
Milady
,
``
that
man
has
,
then
,
a
spark
of
pity
*NL*
in
his
soul
;
of
that
spark
I
will
make
a
flame
that
shall
devour
him
.
As
*NL*
to
the
other
,
he
knows
me
,
he
fears
me
,
and
knows
what
he
has
to
expect
*NL*
of
me
if
ever
I
escape
from
his
hands
.
It
is
useless
,
then
,
to
attempt
*NL*
anything
with
him
.
But
Felton
--
that
's
another
thing
.
He
is
a
young
,
*NL*
ingenuous
,
pure
man
who
seems
virtuous
;
him
there
are
means
of
*NL*
destroying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Milady
went
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
Anyone
who
had
seen
her
sleeping
might
have
said
she
was
a
young
girl
*NL*
dreaming
of
the
crown
of
flowers
she
was
to
wear
on
her
brow
at
the
next
*NL*
festival
.

*NL*

53
CAPTIVITY
:
THE
SECOND
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
dreamed
that
she
at
length
had
d'Artagnan
in
her
power
,
that
she
*NL*
was
present
at
his
execution
;
and
it
was
the
sight
of
his
odious
blood
,
*NL*
flowing
beneath
the
ax
of
the
headsman
,
which
spread
that
charming
smile
*NL*
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
as
a
prisoner
sleeps
,
rocked
by
his
first
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
they
entered
her
chamber
she
was
still
in
bed
.
*NL*
Felton
remained
in
the
corridor
.
He
brought
with
him
the
woman
of
whom
*NL*
he
had
spoken
the
evening
before
,
and
who
had
just
arrived
;
this
woman
*NL*
entered
,
and
approaching
Milady
's
bed
,
offered
her
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
habitually
pale
;
her
complexion
might
therefore
deceive
a
*NL*
person
who
saw
her
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
a
fever
,
''
said
she
;
``
I
have
not
slept
a
single
instant
during
*NL*
all
this
long
night
.
I
suffer
horribly
.
Are
you
likely
to
be
more
humane
*NL*
to
me
than
others
were
yesterday
?
All
I
ask
is
permission
to
remain
*NL*
abed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
have
a
physician
called
?
''
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
listened
to
this
dialogue
without
speaking
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
reflected
that
the
more
people
she
had
around
her
the
more
she
*NL*
would
have
to
work
upon
,
and
Lord
de
Winter
would
redouble
his
watch
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
physician
might
declare
the
ailment
feigned
;
and
Milady
,
*NL*
after
having
lost
the
first
trick
,
was
not
willing
to
lose
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
fetch
a
physician
?
''
said
she
.
``
What
could
be
the
good
of
that
?
*NL*
These
gentlemen
declared
yesterday
that
my
illness
was
a
comedy
;
it
*NL*
would
be
just
the
same
today
,
no
doubt
--
for
since
yesterday
evening
they
*NL*
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
send
for
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Felton
,
who
became
impatient
,
``
say
yourself
,
madame
,
what
*NL*
treatment
you
wish
followed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
how
can
I
tell
?
My
God
!
I
know
that
I
suffer
,
that
's
all
.
Give
me
*NL*
anything
you
like
,
it
is
of
little
consequence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
fetch
Lord
de
Winter
,
''
said
Felton
,
tired
of
these
eternal
*NL*
complaints
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
cried
Milady
;
``
no
,
sir
,
do
not
call
him
,
I
conjure
you
.
I
*NL*
am
well
,
I
want
nothing
;
do
not
call
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
so
much
vehemence
,
such
magnetic
eloquence
to
this
exclamation
,
*NL*
that
Felton
in
spite
of
himself
advanced
some
steps
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
come
!
''
thought
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
madame
,
if
you
really
suffer
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
a
physician
*NL*
shall
be
sent
for
;
and
if
you
deceive
us
--
well
,
it
will
be
the
worse
for
*NL*
you
.
But
at
least
we
shall
not
have
to
reproach
ourselves
with
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
made
no
reply
,
but
turning
her
beautiful
head
round
upon
her
*NL*
pillow
,
she
burst
into
tears
,
and
uttered
heartbreaking
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
surveyed
her
for
an
instant
with
his
usual
impassiveness
;
then
,
*NL*
seeing
that
the
crisis
threatened
to
be
prolonged
,
he
went
out
.
The
*NL*
woman
followed
him
,
and
Lord
de
Winter
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
I
begin
to
see
my
way
,
''
murmured
Milady
,
with
a
savage
joy
,
*NL*
burying
herself
under
the
clothes
to
conceal
from
anybody
who
might
be
*NL*
watching
her
this
burst
of
inward
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
it
is
time
that
the
malady
should
be
over
,
''
said
she
;
``
let
me
rise
,
*NL*
and
obtain
some
success
this
very
day
.
I
have
but
ten
days
,
and
this
*NL*
evening
two
of
them
will
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
they
entered
Milady
's
chamber
they
had
brought
her
*NL*
breakfast
.
Now
,
she
thought
,
they
could
not
long
delay
coming
to
clear
*NL*
the
table
,
and
that
Felton
would
then
reappear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
not
deceived
.
Felton
reappeared
,
and
without
observing
*NL*
whether
Milady
had
or
had
not
touched
her
repast
,
made
a
sign
that
the
*NL*
table
should
be
carried
out
of
the
room
,
it
having
been
brought
in
ready
*NL*
spread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
remained
behind
;
he
held
a
book
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
reclining
in
an
armchair
near
the
chimney
,
beautiful
,
pale
,
and
*NL*
resigned
,
looked
like
a
holy
virgin
awaiting
martyrdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
approached
her
,
and
said
,
``
Lord
de
Winter
,
who
is
a
Catholic
,
*NL*
like
yourself
,
madame
,
thinking
that
the
deprivation
of
the
rites
and
*NL*
ceremonies
of
your
church
might
be
painful
to
you
,
has
consented
that
*NL*
you
should
read
every
day
the
ordinary
of
your
Mass
;
and
here
is
a
book
*NL*
which
contains
the
ritual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
manner
in
which
Felton
laid
the
book
upon
the
little
table
near
*NL*
which
Milady
was
sitting
,
at
the
tone
in
which
he
pronounced
the
two
*NL*
words
,
YOUR
MASS
,
at
the
disdainful
smile
with
which
he
accompanied
*NL*
them
,
Milady
raised
her
head
,
and
looked
more
attentively
at
the
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
plain
arrangement
of
the
hair
,
by
that
costume
of
extreme
*NL*
simplicity
,
by
the
brow
polished
like
marble
and
as
hard
and
*NL*
impenetrable
,
she
recognized
one
of
those
gloomy
Puritans
she
had
so
*NL*
often
met
,
not
only
in
the
court
of
King
James
,
but
in
that
of
the
King
*NL*
of
France
,
where
,
in
spite
of
the
remembrance
of
the
St.
Bartholomew
,
*NL*
they
sometimes
came
to
seek
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
had
one
of
those
sudden
inspirations
which
only
people
of
*NL*
genius
receive
in
great
crises
,
in
supreme
moments
which
are
to
decide
*NL*
their
fortunes
or
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
two
words
,
YOUR
MASS
,
and
a
simple
glance
cast
upon
Felton
,
*NL*
revealed
to
her
all
the
importance
of
the
reply
she
was
about
to
make
;
*NL*
but
with
that
rapidity
of
intelligence
which
was
peculiar
to
her
,
this
*NL*
reply
,
ready
arranged
,
presented
itself
to
her
lips
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
she
,
with
an
accent
of
disdain
in
unison
with
that
which
she
*NL*
had
remarked
in
the
voice
of
the
young
officer
,
``
I
,
sir
?
MY
MASS
?
Lord
*NL*
de
Winter
,
the
corrupted
Catholic
,
knows
very
well
that
I
am
not
of
his
*NL*
religion
,
and
this
is
a
snare
he
wishes
to
lay
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
what
religion
are
you
,
then
,
madame
?
''
asked
Felton
,
with
an
*NL*
astonishment
which
in
spite
of
the
empire
he
held
over
himself
he
could
*NL*
not
entirely
conceal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
it
,
''
cried
Milady
,
with
a
feigned
exultation
,
``
on
the
day
*NL*
when
I
shall
have
suffered
sufficiently
for
my
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
look
of
Felton
revealed
to
Milady
the
full
extent
of
the
space
she
*NL*
had
opened
for
herself
by
this
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
officer
,
however
,
remained
mute
and
motionless
;
his
look
alone
*NL*
had
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
the
hands
of
my
enemies
,
''
continued
she
,
with
that
tone
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
which
she
knew
was
familiar
to
the
Puritans
.
``
Well
,
let
my
*NL*
God
save
me
,
or
let
me
perish
for
my
God
!
That
is
the
reply
I
beg
you
to
*NL*
make
to
Lord
de
Winter
.
And
as
to
this
book
,
''
added
she
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
manual
with
her
finger
but
without
touching
it
,
as
if
she
must
be
*NL*
contaminated
by
it
,
``
you
may
carry
it
back
and
make
use
of
it
yourself
,
*NL*
for
doubtless
you
are
doubly
the
accomplice
of
Lord
de
Winter
--
the
*NL*
accomplice
in
his
persecutions
,
the
accomplice
in
his
heresies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
made
no
reply
,
took
the
book
with
the
same
appearance
of
*NL*
repugnance
which
he
had
before
manifested
,
and
retired
pensively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
came
toward
five
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
Milady
had
had
*NL*
time
,
during
the
whole
day
,
to
trace
her
plan
of
conduct
.
She
received
*NL*
him
like
a
woman
who
had
already
recovered
all
her
advantages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
,
''
said
the
baron
,
seating
himself
in
the
armchair
opposite
*NL*
that
occupied
by
Milady
,
and
stretching
out
his
legs
carelessly
upon
the
*NL*
hearth
,
``
it
appears
we
have
made
a
little
apostasy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
that
since
we
last
met
you
have
changed
your
religion
.
*NL*
You
have
not
by
chance
married
a
Protestant
for
a
third
husband
,
have
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
yourself
,
my
Lord
,
''
replied
the
prisoner
,
with
majesty
;
``
for
*NL*
though
I
hear
your
words
,
I
declare
I
do
not
understand
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
no
religion
at
all
;
I
like
that
best
,
''
replied
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
that
is
most
in
accord
with
your
own
principles
,
''
replied
*NL*
Milady
,
frigidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
confess
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
not
avow
this
religious
indifference
,
my
Lord
;
your
*NL*
debaucheries
and
crimes
would
vouch
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
talk
of
debaucheries
,
Madame
Messalina
,
Lady
Macbeth
!
Either
*NL*
I
misunderstand
you
or
you
are
very
shameless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only
speak
thus
because
you
are
overheard
,
''
coolly
replied
Milady
;
*NL*
``
and
you
wish
to
interest
your
jailers
and
your
hangmen
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
jailers
and
my
hangmen
!
Heyday
,
madame
!
you
are
taking
a
poetical
*NL*
tone
,
and
the
comedy
of
yesterday
turns
to
a
tragedy
this
evening
.
As
to
*NL*
the
rest
,
in
eight
days
you
will
be
where
you
ought
to
be
,
and
my
task
*NL*
will
be
completed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infamous
task
!
impious
task
!
''
cried
Milady
,
with
the
exultation
of
a
*NL*
victim
who
provokes
his
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
''
said
de
Winter
,
rising
,
``
I
think
the
hussy
is
going
mad
!
*NL*
Come
,
come
,
calm
yourself
,
Madame
Puritan
,
or
I
'll
remove
you
to
a
*NL*
dungeon
.
It
's
my
Spanish
wine
that
has
got
into
your
head
,
is
it
not
?
*NL*
But
never
mind
;
that
sort
of
intoxication
is
not
dangerous
,
and
will
*NL*
have
no
bad
effects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Lord
de
Winter
retired
swearing
,
which
at
that
period
was
a
very
*NL*
knightly
habit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
was
indeed
behind
the
door
,
and
had
not
lost
one
word
of
this
*NL*
scene
.
Milady
had
guessed
aright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
,
go
!
''
said
she
to
her
brother
;
``
the
effects
ARE
drawing
near
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
;
but
you
,
weak
fool
,
will
not
see
them
until
it
is
too
*NL*
late
to
shun
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
was
re-established
.
Two
hours
passed
away
.
Milady
's
supper
was
*NL*
brought
in
,
and
she
was
found
deeply
engaged
in
saying
her
prayers
*NL*
aloud
--
prayers
which
she
had
learned
of
an
old
servant
of
her
second
*NL*
husband
,
a
most
austere
Puritan
.
She
appeared
to
be
in
ecstasy
,
and
did
*NL*
not
pay
the
least
attention
to
what
was
going
on
around
her
.
Felton
made
*NL*
a
sign
that
she
should
not
be
disturbed
;
and
when
all
was
arranged
,
he
*NL*
went
out
quietly
with
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
knew
she
might
be
watched
,
so
she
continued
her
prayers
to
the
*NL*
end
;
and
it
appeared
to
her
that
the
soldier
who
was
on
duty
at
her
door
*NL*
did
not
march
with
the
same
step
,
and
seemed
to
listen
.
For
the
moment
*NL*
she
wished
nothing
better
.
She
arose
,
came
to
the
table
,
ate
but
little
,
*NL*
and
drank
only
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
after
,
her
table
was
cleared
;
but
Milady
remarked
that
this
time
*NL*
Felton
did
not
accompany
the
soldiers
.
He
feared
,
then
,
to
see
her
too
*NL*
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
toward
the
wall
to
smile
--
for
there
was
in
this
smile
such
an
*NL*
expression
of
triumph
that
this
smile
alone
would
have
betrayed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
allowed
,
therefore
,
half
an
hour
to
pass
away
;
and
as
at
that
moment
*NL*
all
was
silence
in
the
old
castle
,
as
nothing
was
heard
but
the
eternal
*NL*
murmur
of
the
waves
--
that
immense
breaking
of
the
ocean
--
with
her
pure
,
*NL*
harmonious
,
and
powerful
voice
,
she
began
the
first
couplet
of
the
psalm
*NL*
then
in
great
favor
with
the
Puritans
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
leavest
thy
servants
,
Lord
,
To
see
if
they
be
strong
;
But
soon
*NL*
thou
dost
afford
Thy
hand
to
lead
them
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
verses
were
not
excellent
--
very
far
from
it
;
but
as
it
is
well
*NL*
known
,
the
Puritans
did
not
pique
themselves
upon
their
poetry
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
singing
,
Milady
listened
.
The
soldier
on
guard
at
her
door
*NL*
stopped
,
as
if
he
had
been
changed
into
stone
.
Milady
was
then
able
to
*NL*
judge
of
the
effect
she
had
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
continued
her
singing
with
inexpressible
fervor
and
feeling
.
It
*NL*
appeared
to
her
that
the
sounds
spread
to
a
distance
beneath
the
vaulted
*NL*
roofs
,
and
carried
with
them
a
magic
charm
to
soften
the
hearts
of
her
*NL*
jailers
.
It
however
likewise
appeared
that
the
soldier
on
duty
--
a
*NL*
zealous
Catholic
,
no
doubt
--
shook
off
the
charm
,
for
through
the
door
he
*NL*
called
:
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
madame
!
Your
song
is
as
dismal
as
a
`
De
*NL*
profundis
'
;
and
if
besides
the
pleasure
of
being
in
garrison
here
,
we
*NL*
must
hear
such
things
as
these
,
no
mortal
can
hold
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
then
exclaimed
another
stern
voice
which
Milady
recognized
as
*NL*
that
of
Felton
.
``
What
are
you
meddling
with
,
stupid
?
Did
anybody
order
*NL*
you
to
prevent
that
woman
from
singing
?
No
.
You
were
told
to
guard
*NL*
her
--
to
fire
at
her
if
she
attempted
to
fly
.
Guard
her
!
If
she
flies
,
*NL*
kill
her
;
but
do
n't
exceed
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
expression
of
unspeakable
joy
lightened
the
countenance
of
Milady
;
*NL*
but
this
expression
was
fleeting
as
the
reflection
of
lightning
.
Without
*NL*
appearing
to
have
heard
the
dialogue
,
of
which
she
had
not
lost
a
word
,
*NL*
she
began
again
,
giving
to
her
voice
all
the
charm
,
all
the
power
,
all
*NL*
the
seduction
the
demon
had
bestowed
upon
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
all
my
tears
,
my
cares
,
My
exile
,
and
my
chains
,
I
have
my
youth
,
*NL*
my
prayers
,
And
God
,
who
counts
my
pains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
,
of
immense
power
and
sublime
expression
,
gave
to
the
rude
,
*NL*
unpolished
poetry
of
these
psalms
a
magic
and
an
effect
which
the
most
*NL*
exalted
Puritans
rarely
found
in
the
songs
of
their
brethren
,
and
which
*NL*
they
were
forced
to
ornament
with
all
the
resources
of
their
*NL*
imagination
.
Felton
believed
he
heard
the
singing
of
the
angel
who
*NL*
consoled
the
three
Hebrews
in
the
furnace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
our
doors
will
ope
,
With
God
come
our
desire
;
And
if
betrays
*NL*
that
hope
,
To
death
we
can
aspire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
verse
,
into
which
the
terrible
enchantress
threw
her
whole
soul
,
*NL*
completed
the
trouble
which
had
seized
the
heart
of
the
young
officer
.
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
quickly
;
and
Milady
saw
him
appear
,
pale
as
usual
,
*NL*
but
with
his
eye
inflamed
and
almost
wild
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
sing
thus
,
and
with
such
a
voice
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
said
Milady
,
with
mildness
.
``
I
forgot
that
my
songs
*NL*
are
out
of
place
in
this
castle
.
I
have
perhaps
offended
you
in
your
*NL*
creed
;
but
it
was
without
wishing
to
do
so
,
I
swear
.
Pardon
me
,
then
,
a
*NL*
fault
which
is
perhaps
great
,
but
which
certainly
was
involuntary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
so
beautiful
at
this
moment
,
the
religious
ecstasy
in
which
*NL*
she
appeared
to
be
plunged
gave
such
an
expression
to
her
countenance
,
*NL*
that
Felton
was
so
dazzled
that
he
fancied
he
beheld
the
angel
whom
he
*NL*
had
only
just
before
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
he
;
``
you
disturb
,
you
agitate
the
people
who
live
in
*NL*
the
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
,
senseless
young
man
was
not
aware
of
the
incoherence
of
his
*NL*
words
,
while
Milady
was
reading
with
her
lynx
's
eyes
the
very
depths
of
*NL*
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
silent
,
then
,
''
said
Milady
,
casting
down
her
eyes
with
all
*NL*
the
sweetness
she
could
give
to
her
voice
,
with
all
the
resignation
she
*NL*
could
impress
upon
her
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
madame
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
only
do
not
sing
so
loud
,
particularly
*NL*
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
these
words
Felton
,
feeling
that
he
could
not
long
maintain
his
*NL*
severity
toward
his
prisoner
,
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
done
right
,
Lieutenant
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
``
Such
songs
disturb
*NL*
the
mind
;
and
yet
we
become
accustomed
to
them
,
her
voice
is
so
*NL*
beautiful
.

CAPTIVITY
:
THE
THIRD
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
had
fallen
;
but
there
was
still
another
step
to
be
taken
.
He
must
*NL*
be
retained
,
or
rather
he
must
be
left
quite
alone
;
and
Milady
but
*NL*
obscurely
perceived
the
means
which
could
lead
to
this
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
more
must
be
done
.
He
must
be
made
to
speak
,
in
order
that
he
*NL*
might
be
spoken
to
--
for
Milady
very
well
knew
that
her
greatest
*NL*
seduction
was
in
her
voice
,
which
so
skillfully
ran
over
the
whole
gamut
*NL*
of
tones
from
human
speech
to
language
celestial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
in
spite
of
all
this
seduction
Milady
might
fail
--
for
Felton
was
*NL*
forewarned
,
and
that
against
the
least
chance
.
From
that
moment
she
*NL*
watched
all
his
actions
,
all
his
words
,
from
the
simplest
glance
of
his
*NL*
eyes
to
his
gestures
--
even
to
a
breath
that
could
be
interpreted
as
a
*NL*
sigh
.
In
short
,
she
studied
everything
,
as
a
skillful
comedian
does
to
*NL*
whom
a
new
part
has
been
assigned
in
a
line
to
which
he
is
not
*NL*
accustomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Face
to
face
with
Lord
de
Winter
her
plan
of
conduct
was
more
easy
.
She
*NL*
had
laid
that
down
the
preceding
evening
.
To
remain
silent
and
dignified
*NL*
in
his
presence
;
from
time
to
time
to
irritate
him
by
affected
disdain
,
*NL*
by
a
contemptuous
word
;
to
provoke
him
to
threats
and
violence
which
*NL*
would
produce
a
contrast
with
her
own
resignation
--
such
was
her
plan
.
*NL*
Felton
would
see
all
;
perhaps
he
would
say
nothing
,
but
he
would
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
Felton
came
as
usual
;
but
Milady
allowed
him
to
preside
*NL*
over
all
the
preparations
for
breakfast
without
addressing
a
word
to
*NL*
him
.
At
the
moment
when
he
was
about
to
retire
,
she
was
cheered
with
a
*NL*
ray
of
hope
,
for
she
thought
he
was
about
to
speak
;
but
his
lips
moved
*NL*
without
any
sound
leaving
his
mouth
,
and
making
a
powerful
effort
to
*NL*
control
himself
,
he
sent
back
to
his
heart
the
words
that
were
about
to
*NL*
escape
from
his
lips
,
and
went
out
.
Toward
midday
,
Lord
de
Winter
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
tolerably
fine
winter
's
day
,
and
a
ray
of
that
pale
English
sun
*NL*
which
lights
but
does
not
warm
came
through
the
bars
of
her
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
looking
out
at
the
window
,
and
pretended
not
to
hear
the
door
*NL*
as
it
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
after
having
played
comedy
,
after
having
*NL*
played
tragedy
,
we
are
now
playing
melancholy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
continued
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
I
understand
.
You
would
like
very
*NL*
well
to
be
at
liberty
on
that
beach
!
You
would
like
very
well
to
be
in
a
*NL*
good
ship
dancing
upon
the
waves
of
that
emerald-green
sea
;
you
would
*NL*
like
very
well
,
either
on
land
or
on
the
ocean
,
to
lay
for
me
one
of
*NL*
those
nice
little
ambuscades
you
are
so
skillful
in
planning
.
Patience
,
*NL*
patience
!
In
four
days
'
time
the
shore
will
be
beneath
your
feet
,
the
*NL*
sea
will
be
open
to
you
--
more
open
than
will
perhaps
be
agreeable
to
*NL*
you
,
for
in
four
days
England
will
be
relieved
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
folded
her
hands
,
and
raising
her
fine
eyes
toward
heaven
,
``
Lord
,
*NL*
Lord
,
''
said
she
,
with
an
angelic
meekness
of
gesture
and
tone
,
``
pardon
*NL*
this
man
,
as
I
myself
pardon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
pray
,
accursed
woman
!
''
cried
the
baron
;
``
your
prayer
is
so
much
*NL*
the
more
generous
from
your
being

I
swear
to
you
,
in
the
power
of
a
man
*NL*
who
will
never
pardon
you
!
''
and
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
he
went
out
a
piercing
glance
darted
through
the
opening
*NL*
of
the
nearly
closed
door
,
and
she
perceived
Felton
,
who
drew
quickly
to
*NL*
one
side
to
prevent
being
seen
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
,
and
began
to
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
my
God
!
''
said
she
,
``
thou
knowest
in
what
holy
cause
I
suffer
;
*NL*
give
me
,
then
,
strength
to
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
gently
;
the
beautiful
supplicant
pretended
not
to
hear
*NL*
the
noise
,
and
in
a
voice
broken
by
tears
,
she
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
of
vengeance
!
God
of
goodness
!
wilt
thou
allow
the
frightful
*NL*
projects
of
this
man
to
be
accomplished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
only
she
pretended
to
hear
the
sound
of
Felton
's
steps
,
and
rising
*NL*
quick
as
thought
,
she
blushed
,
as
if
ashamed
of
being
surprised
on
her
*NL*
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
like
to
disturb
those
who
pray
,
madame
,
''
said
Felton
,
*NL*
seriously
;
``
do
not
disturb
yourself
on
my
account
,
I
beseech
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
I
was
praying
,
sir
?
''
said
Milady
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
*NL*
sobs
.
``
You
were
deceived
,
sir
;
I
was
not
praying

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
then
,
madame

''
replied
Felton
,
in
the
same
serious
voice
,
*NL*
but
with
a
milder
tone
,
``
do
you
think
I
assume
the
right
of
preventing
a
*NL*
creature
from
prostrating
herself
before
her
Creator
?
God
forbid
!
*NL*
Besides
,
repentance
becomes
the
guilty
;
whatever
crimes
they
may
have
*NL*
committed
,
for
me
the
guilty
are
sacred
at
the
feet
of
God
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Guilty
?
I
?

said
Milady
,
with
a
smile
which
might
have
disarmed
the
*NL*
angel
of
the
last
judgment
.
``
Guilty
?
Oh
,
my
God
,
thou
knowest
whether
I
*NL*
am
guilty

Say
I
am
condemned

sir
,
if
you
please
;
but
you
know
that
*NL*
God

who
loves
martyrs

sometimes
permits
the
innocent
to
be
condemned

*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
condemned

were

innocent

*NL*
Felton

``
the
greater
would
be
the
necessity

I
myself

aid
you
with
my
prayers

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
a
just
man

cried
Milady
,
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
.
``
I
*NL*
can
hold
out
no
longer

I
fear
I
shall
be
wanting
in
strength

moment

I
shall
be
forced
to
undergo
the
struggle

confess
my

Listen

then
,
to
the
supplication
of
a
despairing
woman

You
are
*NL*
abused

sir

that
is
not
the
question

I

ask

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to

Felton
;
``
happily
I
am
neither

the

with
a

incredulity

*NL*
``
You

blushing
;

Lord

not
capable

*NL*
``

said
Milady
to
herself
;

Then
aloud

excited

*NL*

Milady

*NL*
``
The

Felton

''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
only
expressed
,
with
regard
to
the
duke
,
the
feeling
of
*NL*
execration
which
all
the
English
had
declared
toward
him
whom
the
*NL*
Catholics
themselves
called
the
extortioner
,
the
pillager
,
the
*NL*
debauchee
,

whom
the
Puritans
styled
simply
Satan

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Milady
;

supplicate
thee

*NL*
``
Do

Felton

*NL*
``
At

Milady
to
herself

at
the
height

joy

having
obtained
so
quickly
such
a

*NL*
Yes

yes

Milady
*NL*
twisted
her
arms
as
if
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief

*NL*
*NL*
Felton
no
doubt
felt
within
himself
that
his
strength
was
abandoning
*NL*
him
,
and
he
made
several
steps
toward
the
door
;
but
the
prisoner
,
whose
*NL*
eye
never
left
him
,
sprang
in
pursuit
of
him
and
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
cried
she
,
``
be
kind

clement

That
knife

the
fatal
prudence

deprived

Only
one

have
saved
my
honor

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
kill
yourself

cried
Felton

with
terror

forgetting
to
withdraw
*NL*
his
hands
from
the
hands
of
the
prisoner

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told

murmured
Milady

lowering
her
voice
,
and
allowing
*NL*
herself
to
sink
overpowered
to
the
ground
;
``
I
have
told
my
secret
!
He
*NL*
knows
all

My
God
,
I
am
lost
!

*NL*
*NL*
Felton
remained
standing
,
motionless
and
undecided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
still
doubts
,
''
thought
Milady
;
``
I
have
not
been
earnest
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Someone
was
heard
in
the
corridor
;
Milady
recognized
the
step
of
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
recognized
it
also
,
and
made
a
step
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
sprang
toward
him
.
``
Oh
,
not
a
word
,
''
said
she
in
a
concentrated
*NL*
voice
,
``
not
a
word
of
all
that
I
have
said
to
you
to
this
man

or
I
am
*NL*
lost

and
it
would
be
you
--
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
as
the
steps
drew
near
,
she
became
silent
for
fear
of
being
heard
,
*NL*
applying
,
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
terror
,
her
beautiful
hand
to
*NL*
Felton
's
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
gently
repulsed
Milady
,
and
she
sank
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
passed
before
the
door
without
stopping
,
and
they
heard
*NL*
the
noise
of
his
footsteps
soon
die
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
,
as
pale
as
death
,
remained
some
instants
with
his
ear
bent
and
*NL*
listening
;
then
,
when
the
sound
was
quite
extinct
,
he
breathed
like
a
*NL*
man
awaking
from
a
dream
,
and
rushed
out
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Milady
,
listening
in
her
turn
to
the
noise
of
Felton
's
steps
,
*NL*
which
withdrew
in
a
direction
opposite
to
those
of
Lord
de
Winter
;
``
at
*NL*
length
you
are
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
her
brow
darkened
.
``
If
he
tells
the
baron
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
*NL*
lost

for
the
baron

very
well
that
I
shall
not
kill

*NL*
will
place
me
before
him
with
a
knife
in
my
hand
,
and
he
will
discover
*NL*
that
all
this
despair
is
but
acted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
placed
herself
before
the
glass
,
and
regarded
herself
attentively
;
*NL*
never
had
she
appeared
more
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

she

smiling

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Lord
de
Winter
accompanied
the
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
is
your
presence
an
indispensable
accessory
of
my
*NL*
captivity

Could
you
not
spare
me
the
increase
of
torture
which
your
*NL*
visits
cause
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
dear
sister

''
said
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
Did
not
you
sentimentally

inform
me
with

pretty
mouth
of
yours

so
cruel

that
*NL*
you
came
to
England
solely
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
me
at
your
ease

*NL*
an
enjoyment
of
which
you
told
me
you
so
sensibly
felt
the
deprivation
*NL*
that
you
had
risked
everything
for
it
--
seasickness
,
tempest
,
captivity

*NL*
Well
,
here
I
am
;
be
satisfied

Besides
,
this
time
,
my
visit
has
a
*NL*
motive

''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
trembled
;
she
thought
Felton
had
told
all
.
Perhaps
never
in
her
*NL*
life
had
this
woman
,
who
had
experienced
so
many
opposite
and
powerful
*NL*
emotions
,
felt
her
heart
beat
so
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seated
.
Lord
de
Winter
took
a
chair
,
drew
it
toward
her
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
close
beside
her
.
Then
taking
a
paper
out
of
his
pocket
,
he
*NL*
unfolded
it
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
want
to
show
you
the
kind
of
passport
which
I
have
*NL*
drawn
up
,
and
which
will
serve
you
henceforward
as
the
rule
of
order
in
*NL*
the
life
I
consent
to
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
his
eyes
from
Milady
to
the
paper
,
he
read
:
''
`
Order

*NL*
conduct

The

interrupted
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
If

*NL*
any

can
point
it
out
to

and
if
it
be
not
within

*NL*
thousand
leagues
of
London
,
attention
will
be
paid
to
your
wishes

I

will
begin
again

then
:

liberated
after
chastisement

*NL*
She
is

than
three

In

the

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

not

Milady

coldly

''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
remained
silent
;
only
this
time
it
was
no
longer
from
*NL*
affectation
,
but
from
terror
.
She
believed
the
order
ready
for
*NL*
execution
.
She
thought
that
Lord
de
Winter
had
hastened
her
departure
;
*NL*
she
thought
she
was
condemned
to
set
off
that
very
evening
.
Everything
*NL*
in
her
mind
was
lost
for
an
instant
;
when
all
at
once
she
perceived
that
*NL*
no
signature
was
attached
to
the
order
.
The
joy
she
felt
at
this
*NL*
discovery
was
so
great
she
could
not
conceal
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
who
perceived
what
was
passing
in
her
*NL*
mind
;
``
yes
,
you
look
for
the
signature

and
you
say
to
yourself

All
is

not
lost

for
that

It
is
only
shown
to
me
to

terrify
me
,
that

all

You
are
mistaken

Tomorrow
this

will
be

sent

the
Duke
of
Buckingham

The
day

it
will
return
*NL*
signed
by
his

and
marked
with
his
seal
;

four-and-twenty
hours
*NL*
afterward
I
will
answer
for
its
being
carried
into
execution

Adieu
,
*NL*
madame

That
is
all
I
had
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
reply
to
you
,
sir

that
this
abuse
of
power

this
exile

*NL*
fictitious

,
are
infamous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
better
to
be
hanged
in
your
true
name

Milady
?
You
know
*NL*
that
the
English
laws
are
inexorable
on
the
abuse
of
marriage
.
Speak
*NL*
freely
.
Although
my
name
,
or
rather
that
of
my
brother
,
would
be
mixed
*NL*
up
with
the
affair
,
I
will
risk
the
scandal
of
a
public
trial
to
make
*NL*
myself
certain
of
getting
rid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
made
no
reply
,
but
became
as
pale
as
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
you
prefer
peregrination
.
That
's
well
madame
;
and
there
is
an
*NL*
old
proverb
that
says
,
`
Traveling
trains
youth
.
'
My
faith
!
you
are
not
*NL*
wrong
after
all
,
and
life
is
sweet

That
's
the
reason
why
I
take
such
*NL*
care
you
shall
not
deprive
me
of
mine
.
There
only
remains
,
then
,
the
*NL*
question
of
the
five
shillings
to
be
settled
.
You
think
me
rather
*NL*
parsimonious
,
do
n't
you
?
That
's
because
I
do
n't
care
to
leave
you
the
*NL*
means
of
corrupting
your
jailers
.
Besides
,
you
will
always
have
your
*NL*
charms
left
to
seduce
them
with
.
Employ
them
,
if
your
check
with
regard
*NL*
to
Felton
has
not
disgusted
you
with
attempts
of
that
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felton
has
not
told
him
,
''
said
Milady
to
herself
.
``
Nothing
is
lost
,
*NL*
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
madame
,
till
I
see
you
again
!
Tomorrow
I
will
come
and
*NL*
announce
to
you
the
departure
of
my
messenger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
rose
,
saluted
her
ironically
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
breathed
again
.
She
had
still
four
days
before
her
.
Four
days
*NL*
would
quite
suffice
to
complete
the
seduction
of
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
idea
,
however
,
rushed
into
her
mind
.
She
thought
that
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
would
perhaps
send
Felton
himself
to
get
the
order
signed
by
the
*NL*
Duke
of
Buckingham
.
In
that
case
Felton
would
escape
her
--
for
in
order
*NL*
to
secure
success
,
the
magic
of
a
continuous
seduction
was
necessary
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
as
we
have
said
,
one
circumstance
reassured
her
.
Felton
*NL*
had
not
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
would
not
appear
to
be
agitated
by
the
threats
of
Lord
de
Winter
,
*NL*
she
placed
herself
at
the
table
and
ate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
she
had
done
the
evening
before
,
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
*NL*
repeated
her
prayers
aloud
.
As
on
the
evening
before
,
the
soldier
*NL*
stopped
his
march
to
listen
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
she
heard
lighter
steps
than
those
of
the
sentinel
,
which
*NL*
came
from
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
stopped
before
her
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he
,
''
said
she
.
And
she
began
the
same
religious
chant
which
had
*NL*
so
strongly
excited
Felton
the
evening
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
her
voice
--
sweet
,
full
,
and
sonorous
--
vibrated
as
*NL*
harmoniously
and
as
affectingly
as
ever
,
the
door
remained
shut
.
It
*NL*
appeared
however
to
Milady
that
in
one
of
the
furtive
glances
she
darted
*NL*
from
time
to
time
at
the
grating
of
the
door
she
thought
she
saw
the
*NL*
ardent
eyes
of
the
young
man
through
the
narrow
opening
.
But
whether
*NL*
this
was
reality
or
vision
,
he
had
this
time
sufficient
self-command
not
*NL*
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
a
few
instants
after
she
had
finished
her
religious
song
,
*NL*
Milady
thought
she
heard
a
profound
sigh
.
Then
the
same
steps
she
had
*NL*
heard
approach
slowly
withdrew
,
as
if
with
regret
.

CAPTIVITY
:
THE
FOURTH
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
when
Felton
entered
Milady
's
apartment
he
found
her
*NL*
standing
,
mounted
upon
a
chair
,
holding
in
her
hands
a
cord
made
by
*NL*
means
of
torn
cambric
handkerchiefs
,
twisted
into
a
kind
of
rope
one
*NL*
with
another
,
and
tied
at
the
ends
.
At
the
noise
Felton
made
in
*NL*
entering
,
Milady
leaped
lightly
to
the
ground
,
and
tried
to
conceal
*NL*
behind
her
the
improvised
cord
she
held
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
more
pale
than
usual
,
and
his
eyes
,
reddened
by
want
*NL*
of
sleep
,
denoted
that
he
had
passed
a
feverish
night
.
Nevertheless
,
his
*NL*
brow
was
armed
with
a
severity
more
austere
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
slowly
toward
Milady
,
who
had
seated
herself
,
and
taking
an
*NL*
end
of
the
murderous
rope
which
by
neglect
,
or
perhaps
by
design
,
she
*NL*
allowed
to
be
seen
,
``
What
is
this
,
madame
?
''
he
asked
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
?
Nothing
,
''
said
Milady
,
smiling
with
that
painful
expression
which
*NL*
she
knew
so
well
how
to
give
to
her
smile
.
``
Ennui
is
the
mortal
enemy
of
*NL*
prisoners
;
I
had
ennui
,
and
I
amused
myself
with
twisting
that
rope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
turned
his
eyes
toward
the
part
of
the
wall
of
the
apartment
*NL*
before
which
he
had
found
Milady
standing
in
the
armchair
in
which
she
*NL*
was
now
seated
,
and
over
her
head
he
perceived
a
gilt-headed
screw
,
*NL*
fixed
in
the
wall
for
the
purpose
of
hanging
up
clothes
or
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
,
and
the
prisoner
saw
that
start
--
for
though
her
eyes
were
*NL*
cast
down
,
nothing
escaped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
doing
on
that
armchair
?
''
asked
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
consequence
?
''
replied
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
replied
Felton
,
``
I
wish
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
question
me
,
''
said
the
prisoner
;
``
you
know
that
we
who
are
true
*NL*
Christians
are
forbidden
to
lie

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
I
will
tell
you
what
you
were
doing
,

*NL*
rather
what
you
meant
to
do
;
you
were
going
to
complete
the
fatal
*NL*
project
you
cherish
in
your
mind
.
Remember
,
madame
,
if
our
God
forbids
*NL*
falsehood
,
he
much
more
severely
condemns
suicide
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
When

of
his
creatures
persecuted
unjustly

placed

replied
Milady
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
deep
conviction
,
``
God
pardons
suicide
,
for
then
suicide
becomes
*NL*
martyrdom

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
either
too
much

little

No

the

death

not

provided

recognized

mine

require
no

reward

*NL*
*NL*
``

Felton

elated

much
agitated

not

giving
utterance

a

holy
indignation
,
``
you

a

you

ask

give

what

the
Lord
give

it

if
I
am
innocent

I

``
But
I
repeat

in
great
emotion

``
Impossible

impossible

murmured
Felton

who
felt
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
his
heart
the
justness
of
this
argument

``

*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Felton
,
immovable
as
he
was
,
or
appeared
to
be
,
could
not
*NL*
resist
the
secret
influence
which
had
already
taken
possession
of
him
.
*NL*
To
see
this
woman
,
so
beautiful
,
fair
as
the
brightest
vision
,
to
see
*NL*
her
by
turns
overcome
with
grief
and
threatening
;
to
resist
at
once
the
*NL*
ascendancy
of
grief
and
beauty
--
it
was
too
much
for
a
visionary
;
it
was
*NL*
too
much
for
a
brain
weakened
by
the
ardent
dreams
of
an
ecstatic
faith
;
*NL*
it
was
too
much
for
a
heart
furrowed
by
the
love
of
heaven
that
burns
,
*NL*
by
the
hatred
of
men
that
devours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
saw
the
trouble
.
She
felt
by
intuition
the
flame
of
the
opposing
*NL*
passions
which
burned
with
the
blood
in
the
veins
of
the
young
fanatic
.
*NL*
As
a
skillful
general
,
seeing
the
enemy
ready
to
surrender
,
marches
*NL*
toward
him
with
a
cry
of
victory
,
she
rose
,
beautiful
as
an
antique
*NL*
priestess
,
inspired
like
a
Christian
virgin
,
her
arms
extended
,
her
*NL*
throat
uncovered
,
her
hair
disheveled

holding
with
one
hand
her
robe
*NL*
modestly
drawn
over
her
breast
,
her
look
illumined
by
that
fire
which
*NL*
had
already
created
such
disorder
in
the
veins
of
the
young
Puritan
,
and
*NL*
went
toward
him
,
crying
out
with
a
vehement
air
,
and
in
her
melodious
*NL*
voice
,
to
which
on
this
occasion
she
communicated
a
terrible
energy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
this
victim
to
Baal
be
sent
,
To
the
lions
the
martyr
be
thrown
!
Thy
*NL*
God
shall
teach
thee
to
repent
!
From
th
'
abyss
he
'll
give
ear
to
my
*NL*
moan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
stood
before
this
strange
apparition
like
one
petrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
art
thou
?
Who
art
thou
?
''
cried
he
,
clasping
his
hands
.
``
Art
thou
a
*NL*
messenger
from
God
;
art
thou
a
minister
from
hell
;
art
thou
an
angel
or
*NL*
a
demon
;
callest
thou
thyself
Eloa
or
Astarte
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
know
me
,
Felton
?
I
am
neither
an
angel
nor
a
demon
;
I
am
a
*NL*
daughter
of
earth
,
I
am
a
sister
of
thy
faith
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
said
Felton
,
``
I
doubted
,
but
now
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
believe
,
and
still
you
are
an
accomplice
of
that
child
of
Belial
*NL*
who
is
called
Lord
de
Winter
!
You
believe
,
and
yet
you
leave
me
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
mine
enemies
,
of
the
enemy
of
England
,
of
the
enemy
of
God
!
You
*NL*
believe
,
and
yet
you
deliver
me
up
to
him
who
fills
and
defiles
the
*NL*
world
with
his
heresies
and
debaucheries
--
to
that
infamous
Sardanapalus
*NL*
whom
the
blind
call
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
and
whom
believers
name
*NL*
Antichrist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deliver
you
up
to
Buckingham
?
I
?
what
mean
you
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
eyes
,
''
cried
Milady
,
``
but
they
see
not
;
ears
have
they
,
but
*NL*
they
hear
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
said
Felton
,
passing
his
hands
over
his
brow
,
covered
with
*NL*
sweat
,
as
if
to
remove
his
last
doubt
.
``
Yes
,
I
recognize
the
voice
which
*NL*
speaks
to
me
in
my
dreams
;
yes
,
I
recognize
the
features
of
the
angel
*NL*
who
appears
to
me
every
night
,
crying
to
my
soul
,
which
can
not
sleep
:
*NL*
`
Strike
,
save
England
,
save
thyself
--
for
thou
wilt
die
without
having
*NL*
appeased
God
!
'
Speak
,
speak
!
''
cried
Felton
,
``
I
can
understand
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
of
terrible
joy
,
but
rapid
as
thought
,
gleamed
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
fugitive
this
homicide
flash
,
Felton
saw
it
,
and
started
as
if
*NL*
its
light
had
revealed
the
abysses
of
this
woman
's
heart
.
He
recalled
,
*NL*
all
at
once
,
the
warnings
of
Lord
de
Winter
,
the
seductions
of
Milady
,
*NL*
her
first
attempts
after
her
arrival
.
He
drew
back
a
step
,
and
hung
down
*NL*
his
head
,
without
,
however
,
ceasing
to
look
at
her
,
as
if
,
fascinated
by
*NL*
this
strange
creature
,
he
could
not
detach
his
eyes
from
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
not
a
woman
to
misunderstand
the
meaning
of
this
hesitation
.
*NL*
Under
her
apparent
emotions
her
icy
coolness
never
abandoned
her
.
Before
*NL*
Felton
replied
,
and
before
she
should
be
forced
to
resume
this
*NL*
conversation
,
so
difficult
to
be
sustained
in
the
same
exalted
tone
,
she
*NL*
let
her
hands
fall
;
and
as
if
the
weakness
of
the
woman
overpowered
the
*NL*
enthusiasm
of
the
inspired
fanatic
,
she
said
:
``
But
no
,
it
is
not
for
me
*NL*
to
be
the
Judith
to
deliver
Bethulia
from
this
Holofernes
.
The
sword
of
*NL*
the
eternal
is
too
heavy
for
my
arm
.
Allow
me
,
then
,
to
avoid
dishonor
*NL*
by
death
;
let
me
take
refuge
in
martyrdom
.
I
do
not
ask
you
for
liberty
,
*NL*
as
a
guilty
one
would
,
nor
for
vengeance
,
as
would
a
pagan
.
Let
me
die
;
*NL*
that
is
all
.
I
supplicate
you
,
I
implore
you
on
my
knees
--
let
me
die
,
*NL*
and
my
last
sigh
shall
be
a
blessing
for
my
preserver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
voice
,
so
sweet
and
suppliant
,
seeing
that
look
,
so
timid
*NL*
and
downcast
,
Felton
reproached
himself
.
By
degrees
the
enchantress
had
*NL*
clothed
herself
with
that
magic
adornment
which
she
assumed
and
threw
*NL*
aside
at
will
;
that
is
to
say
,
beauty
,
meekness
,
and
tears
--
and
above
*NL*
all
,
the
irresistible
attraction
of
mystical
voluptuousness
,
the
most
*NL*
devouring
of
all
voluptuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Felton
,
``
I
can
do
but
one
thing
,
which
is
to
pity
you
if
*NL*
you
prove
to
me
you
are
a
victim
!
But
Lord
de
Winter
makes
cruel
*NL*
accusations
against
you
.
You
are
a
Christian
;
you
are
my
sister
in
*NL*
religion
.
I
feel
myself
drawn
toward
you
--
I
,
who
have
never
loved
anyone
*NL*
but
my
benefactor
--
I
who
have
met
with
nothing
but
traitors
and
impious
*NL*
men
.
But
you
,
madame
,
so
beautiful
in
reality
,
you
,
so
pure
in
*NL*
appearance
,
must
have
committed
great
iniquities
for
Lord
de
Winter
to
*NL*
pursue
you
thus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
eyes
,
''
repeated
Milady
,
with
an
accent
of
indescribable
*NL*
grief
,
``
but
they
see
not
;
ears
have
they
,
but
they
hear
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
the
young
officer
,
``
speak
,
then
,
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confide
my
shame
to
you
,
''
cried
Milady
,
with
the
blush
of
modesty
upon
*NL*
her
countenance
,
``
for
often
the
crime
of
one
becomes
the
shame
of
*NL*
another
--
confide
my
shame
to
you
,
a
man
,
and
I
a
woman
?
Oh
,
''
continued
*NL*
she
,
placing
her
hand
modestly
over
her
beautiful
eyes
,
``
never
!
*NL*
never
!
--
I
could
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
,
to
a
brother
?
''
said
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
looked
at
him
for
some
time
with
an
expression
which
the
young
*NL*
man
took
for
doubt
,
but
which
,
however
,
was
nothing
but
observation
,
or
*NL*
rather
the
wish
to
fascinate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
,
in
his
turn
a
suppliant
,
clasped
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
I
confide
in
my
brother
;
I
will
dare
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
steps
of
Lord
de
Winter
were
heard
;
but
this
time
the
*NL*
terrible
brother-in-law
of
Milady
did
not
content
himself
,
as
on
the
*NL*
preceding
day
,
with
passing
before
the
door
and
going
away
again
.
He
*NL*
paused
,
exchanged
two
words
with
the
sentinel
;
then
the
door
opened
,
and
*NL*
he
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
exchange
of
these
two
words
Felton
drew
back
quickly
,
and
*NL*
when
Lord
de
Winter
entered
,
he
was
several
paces
from
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
entered
slowly
,
sending
a
scrutinizing
glance
from
Milady
to
*NL*
the
young
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
here
a
very
long
time
,
John
,
''
said
he
.
``
Has
this
woman
*NL*
been
relating
her
crimes
to
you
?
In
that
case
I
can
comprehend
the
*NL*
length
of
the
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
started
;
and
Milady
felt
she
was
lost
if
she
did
not
come
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
the
disconcerted
Puritan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
fear
your
prisoner
should
escape
!
''
said
she
.
``
Well
,
ask
your
*NL*
worthy
jailer
what
favor
I
this
instant
solicited
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
demanded
a
favor
?
''
said
the
baron
,
suspiciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Lord
,
''
replied
the
young
man
,
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
favor
,
pray
?
''
asked
Lord
de
Winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
knife
,
which
she
would
return
to
me
through
the
grating
of
the
door
a
*NL*
minute
after
she
had
received
it
,
''
replied
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
someone
,
then
,
concealed
here
whose
throat
this
amiable
lady
*NL*
is
desirous
of
cutting
,
''
said
de
Winter
,
in
an
ironical
,
contemptuous
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
myself
,
''
replied
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
given
you
the
choice
between
America
and
Tyburn
,
''
replied
Lord
*NL*
de
Winter
.
``
Choose
Tyburn
,
madame
.
Believe
me
,
the
cord
is
more
certain
*NL*
than
the
knife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
grew
pale
,
and
made
a
step
forward
,
remembering
that
at
the
*NL*
moment
he
entered
Milady
had
a
rope
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
often
thought
of
it
.
''
Then
she
added
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
,
``
And
I
will
think
of
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
felt
a
shudder
run
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
;
probably
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
perceived
this
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistrust
yourself
,
John
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
placed
reliance
upon
you
,
my
*NL*
friend
.
Beware
!
I
have
warned
you
!
But
be
of
good
courage
,
my
lad
;
in
*NL*
three
days
we
shall
be
delivered
from
this
creature
,
and
where
I
shall
*NL*
send
her
she
can
harm
nobody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
hear
him
!
''
cried
Milady
,
with
vehemence
,
so
that
the
baron
might
*NL*
believe
she
was
addressing
heaven
,
and
that
Felton
might
understand
she
*NL*
was
addressing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
lowered
his
head
and
reflected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
took
the
young
officer
by
the
arm
,
and
turned
his
head
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
so
as
not
to
lose
sight
of
Milady
till
he
was
gone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
prisoner
,
when
the
door
was
shut
,
``
I
am
not
so
far
*NL*
advanced
as
I
believed
.
De
Winter
has
changed
his
usual
stupidity
into
a
*NL*
strange
prudence
.
It
is
the
desire
of
vengeance
,
and
how
desire
molds
a
*NL*
man
!
As
to
Felton
,
he
hesitates
.
Ah
,
he
is
not
a
man
like
that
cursed
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
A
Puritan
only
adores
virgins
,
and
he
adores
them
by
*NL*
clasping
his
hands
.
A
Musketeer
loves
women
,
and
he
loves
them
by
*NL*
clasping
his
arms
round
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
waited
,
then
,
with
much
impatience
,
for
she
feared
the
day
would
*NL*
pass
away
without
her
seeing
Felton
again
.
At
last
,
in
an
hour
after
the
*NL*
scene
we
have
just
described
,
she
heard
someone
speaking
in
a
low
voice
*NL*
at
the
door
.
Presently
the
door
opened
,
and
she
perceived
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
advanced
rapidly
into
the
chamber
,
leaving
the
door
open
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
making
a
sign
to
Milady
to
be
silent
;
his
face
was
much
*NL*
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
replied
Felton
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
I
have
just
sent
away
the
*NL*
sentinel
that
I
might
remain
here
without
anybody
knowing
it
,
in
order
*NL*
to
speak
to
you
without
being
overheard
.
The
baron
has
just
related
a
*NL*
frightful
story
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
assumed
her
smile
of
a
resigned
victim
,
and
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Either
you
are
a
demon
,
''
continued
Felton
,
``
or
the
baron
--
my
*NL*
benefactor
,
my
father
--
is
a
monster
.
I
have
known
you
four
days
;
I
have
*NL*
loved
him
four
years
.
I
therefore
may
hesitate
between
you
.
Be
not
*NL*
alarmed
at
what
I
say
;
I
want
to
be
convinced
.
Tonight
,
after
twelve
,
I
*NL*
will
come
and
see
you
,
and
you
shall
convince
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Felton
,
no
,
my
brother
,
''
said
she
;
``
the
sacrifice
is
too
great
,
and
*NL*
I
feel
what
it
must
cost
you
.
No
,
I
am
lost
;
do
not
be
lost
with
me
.
My
*NL*
death
will
be
much
more
eloquent
than
my
life
,
and
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
corpse
will
convince
you
much
better
than
the
words
of
the
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
silent
,
madame
,
''
cried
Felton
,
``
and
do
not
speak
to
me
thus
;
I
came
*NL*
to
entreat
you
to
promise
me
upon
your
honor

to
swear
to
me
by
what
you
*NL*
hold
most
sacred

you
will
make
no
attempt
upon
your
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
promise

said
Milady
,
``
for
no
one
has
more
respect
for
a
*NL*
promise
or
an
oath
than
I
have
;
and
if
I
make
a
promise
I
must
keep
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Felton
,
``
only
promise
till
you
have
seen
me
again

If

when
*NL*
you
have
seen
me
again

you
still
persist

well

then
you
shall
be
free

I
myself
will
give
you
the
weapon
you
desire

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Milady
,
``
for
you
I
will
wait

*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
it
,
by
our
God

Are
you
satisfied
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
said
Felton
,
``
till
tonight

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
darted
out
of
the
room
,
shut
the
door
,
and
waited
in
the
*NL*
corridor
,
the
soldier
's
half-pike
in
his
hand
,
and
as
if
he
had
mounted
*NL*
guard
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
returned
,
and
Felton
gave
him
back
his
weapon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
through
the
grating
to
which
she
had
drawn
near
,
Milady
saw
the
*NL*
young
man
make
a
sign
with
delirious
fervor
,
and
depart
in
an
apparent
*NL*
transport
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
her
,
she
returned
to
her
place
with
a
smile
of
savage
contempt
*NL*
upon
her
lips
,
and
repeated
,
blaspheming
,
that
terrible
name
of
God
,
by
*NL*
whom
she
had
just
sworn
without
ever
having
learned
to
know
Him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
a
senseless
fanatic
!
My
God
,
it
is
I
--
I
--
and
*NL*
this
fellow
who
will
help
me
to
avenge
myself
.

CAPTIVITY
:
THE
FIFTH
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
had
however
achieved
a
half-triumph
,
and
success
doubled
her
*NL*
forces
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
difficult
to
conquer
,
as
she
had
hitherto
done
,
men
prompt
to
*NL*
let
themselves
be
seduced
,
and
whom
the
gallant
education
of
a
court
led
*NL*
quickly
into
her
net
.
Milady
was
handsome
enough
not
to
find
much
*NL*
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
flesh
,
and
she
was
sufficiently
skillful
*NL*
to
prevail
over
all
the
obstacles
of
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
she
had
to
contend
with
an
unpolished
nature
,
concentrated
*NL*
and
insensible
by
force
of
austerity
.
Religion
and
its
observances
had
*NL*
made
Felton
a
man
inaccessible
to
ordinary
seductions
.
There
fermented
*NL*
in
that
sublimated
brain
plans
so
vast
,
projects
so
tumultuous
,
that
*NL*
there
remained
no
room
for
any
capricious
or
material
love
--
that
*NL*
sentiment
which
is
fed
by
leisure
and
grows
with
corruption
.
Milady
had
,
*NL*
then
,
made
a
breach
by
her
false
virtue
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
horribly
*NL*
prejudiced
against
her
,
and
by
her
beauty
in
the
heart
of
a
man
hitherto
*NL*
chaste
and
pure
.
In
short
,
she
had
taken
the
measure
of
motives
hitherto
*NL*
unknown
to
herself
,
through
this
experiment
,
made
upon
the
most
*NL*
rebellious
subject
that
nature
and
religion
could
submit
to
her
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
a
time
,
nevertheless
,
during
the
evening
she
despaired
of
fate
and
*NL*
of
herself
.
She
did
not
invoke
God
,
we
very
well
know
,
but
she
had
faith
*NL*
in
the
genius
of
evil
--
that
immense
sovereignty
which
reigns
in
all
the
*NL*
details
of
human
life
,
and
by
which
,
as
in
the
Arabian
fable
,
a
single
*NL*
pomegranate
seed
is
sufficient
to
reconstruct
a
ruined
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
being
well
prepared
for
the
reception
of
Felton
,
was
able
to
*NL*
erect
her
batteries
for
the
next
day
.
She
knew
she
had
only
two
days
*NL*
left
;
that
when
once
the
order
was
signed
by
Buckingham
--
and
Buckingham
*NL*
would
sign
it
the
more
readily
from
its
bearing
a
false
name
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
,
therefore
,
recognize
the
woman
in
question
--
once
this
order
*NL*
was
signed
,
we
say
,
the
baron
would
make
her
embark
immediately
,
and
she
*NL*
knew
very
well
that
women
condemned
to
exile
employ
arms
much
less
*NL*
powerful
in
their
seductions
than
the
pretendedly
virtuous
woman
whose
*NL*
beauty
is
lighted
by
the
sun
of
the
world
,
whose
style
the
voice
of
*NL*
fashion
lauds
,
and
whom
a
halo
of
aristocracy
gilds
with
enchanting
*NL*
splendors
.
To
be
a
woman
condemned
to
a
painful
and
disgraceful
*NL*
punishment
is
no
impediment
to
beauty
,
but
it
is
an
obstacle
to
the
*NL*
recovery
of
power
.
Like
all
persons
of
real
genius
,
Milady
knew
what
*NL*
suited
her
nature
and
her
means
.
Poverty
was
repugnant
to
her
;
*NL*
degradation
took
away
two-thirds
of
her
greatness
.
Milady
was
only
a
*NL*
queen
while
among
queens
.
The
pleasure
of
satisfied
pride
was
necessary
*NL*
to
her
domination
.
To
command
inferior
beings
was
rather
a
humiliation
*NL*
than
a
pleasure
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
should
certainly
return
from
her
exile
--
she
did
not
doubt
that
a
*NL*
single
instant
;
but
how
long
might
this
exile
last
?
For
an
active
,
*NL*
ambitious
nature
,
like
that
of
Milady
,
days
not
spent
in
climbing
are
*NL*
inauspicious
days
.
What
word
,
then
,
can
be
found
to
describe
the
days
*NL*
which
they
occupy
in
descending
?
To
lose
a
year
,
two
years
,
three
years
,
*NL*
is
to
talk
of
an
eternity
;
to
return
after
the
death
or
disgrace
of
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
perhaps
;
to
return
when
d'Artagnan
and
his
friends
,
happy
and
*NL*
triumphant
,
should
have
received
from
the
queen
the
reward
they
had
well
*NL*
acquired
by
the
services
they
had
rendered
her
--
these
were
devouring
*NL*
ideas
that
a
woman
like
Milady
could
not
endure
.
For
the
rest
,
the
storm
*NL*
which
raged
within
her
doubled
her
strength
,
and
she
would
have
burst
*NL*
the
walls
of
her
prison
if
her
body
had
been
able
to
take
for
a
single
*NL*
instant
the
proportions
of
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
that
which
spurred
her
on
additionally
in
the
midst
of
all
this
was
*NL*
the
remembrance
of
the
cardinal
.
What
must
the
mistrustful
,
restless
,
*NL*
suspicious
cardinal
think
of
her
silence
--
the
cardinal
,
not
merely
her
*NL*
only
support
,
her
only
prop
,
her
only
protector
at
present
,
but
still
*NL*
further
,
the
principal
instrument
of
her
future
fortune
and
vengeance
?
*NL*
She
knew
him
;
she
knew
that
at
her
return
from
a
fruitless
journey
it
*NL*
would
be
in
vain
to
tell
him
of
her
imprisonment
,
in
vain
to
enlarge
*NL*
upon
the
sufferings
she
had
undergone
.
The
cardinal
would
reply
,
with
*NL*
the
sarcastic
calmness
of
the
skeptic
,
strong
at
once
by
power
and
*NL*
genius
,
``
You
should
not
have
allowed
yourself
to
be
taken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Milady
collected
all
her
energies
,
murmuring
in
the
depths
of
her
*NL*
soul
the
name
of
Felton
--
the
only
beam
of
light
that
penetrated
to
her
*NL*
in
the
hell
into
which
she
had
fallen
;
and
like
a
serpent
which
folds
*NL*
and
unfolds
its
rings
to
ascertain
its
strength
,
she
enveloped
Felton
*NL*
beforehand
in
the
thousand
meshes
of
her
inventive
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
,
however
,
passed
away
;
the
hours
,
one
after
another
,
seemed
to
*NL*
awaken
the
clock
as
they
passed
,
and
every
blow
of
the
brass
hammer
*NL*
resounded
upon
the
heart
of
the
prisoner
.
At
nine
o'clock
,
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
made
his
customary
visit
,
examined
the
window
and
the
bars
,
*NL*
sounded
the
floor
and
the
walls
,
looked
to
the
chimney
and
the
doors
,
*NL*
without
,
during
this
long
and
minute
examination
,
he
or
Milady
*NL*
pronouncing
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
both
of
them
understood
that
the
situation
had
become
too
*NL*
serious
to
lose
time
in
useless
words
and
aimless
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
baron
,
on
leaving
her
``
you
will
not
escape
tonight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Felton
came
and
placed
the
sentinel
.
Milady
recognized
*NL*
his
step
.
She
was
as
well
acquainted
with
it
now
as
a
mistress
is
with
*NL*
that
of
the
lover
of
her
heart
;
and
yet
Milady
at
the
same
time
detested
*NL*
and
despised
this
weak
fanatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
not
the
appointed
hour
.
Felton
did
not
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
after
,
as
midnight
sounded
,
the
sentinel
was
relieved
.
This
*NL*
time
it
WAS
the
hour
,
and
from
this
moment
Milady
waited
with
*NL*
impatience
.
The
new
sentinel
commenced
his
walk
in
the
corridor
.
At
the
*NL*
expiration
of
ten
minutes
Felton
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
all
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
the
young
man
to
the
sentinel
.
``
On
no
pretense
leave
the
*NL*
door
,
for
you
know
that
last
night
my
Lord
punished
a
soldier
for
having
*NL*
quit
his
post
for
an
instant
,
although
I
,
during
his
absence
,
watched
in
*NL*
his
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
it
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recommend
you
therefore
to
keep
the
strictest
watch
.
For
my
part
I
am
*NL*
going
to
pay
a
second
visit
to
this
woman
,
who
I
fear
entertains
*NL*
sinister
intentions
upon
her
own
life
,
and
I
have
received
orders
to
*NL*
watch
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
murmured
Milady
;
``
the
austere
Puritan
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
soldier
,
he
only
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
,
Lieutenant
!
''
said
he
;
``
you
are
not
unlucky
in
being
charged
*NL*
with
such
commissions
,
particularly
if
my
Lord
has
authorized
you
to
*NL*
look
into
her
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
blushed
.
Under
any
other
circumstances
he
would
have
reprimanded
*NL*
the
soldier
for
indulging
in
such
pleasantry
,
but
his
conscience
*NL*
murmured
too
loud
for
his
mouth
to
dare
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
call
,
come
,
''
said
he
.
``
If
anyone
comes
,
call
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
Lieutenant
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
entered
Milady
's
apartment
.
Milady
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
here
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
come
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
and
I
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promised
me
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
my
God
!
''
said
the
young
man
,
who
in
spite
of
his
self-command
*NL*
felt
his
knees
tremble
and
the
sweat
start
from
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promised
to
bring
a
knife
,
and
to
leave
it
with
me
after
our
*NL*
interview
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
of
that
,
madame
,
''
said
Felton
.
``
There
is
no
situation
,
*NL*
however
terrible
it
may
be
,
which
can
authorize
a
creature
of
God
to
*NL*
inflict
death
upon
himself
.
I
have
reflected
,
and
I
can
not
,
must
not
be
*NL*
guilty
of
such
a
sin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
reflected
!
''
said
the
prisoner
,
sitting
down
in
her
*NL*
armchair
,
with
a
smile
of
disdain
;
``
and
I
also
have
reflected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
a
man
who
does
not
keep
his
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
murmured
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
retire
,
''
said
Milady
.
``
I
will
not
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
knife
,
''
said
Felton
,
drawing
from
his
pocket
the
weapon
*NL*
which
he
had
brought
,
according
to
his
promise
,
but
which
he
hesitated
*NL*
to
give
to
his
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
it
,
''
said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honor
,
I
will
instantly
return
it
to
you
.
You
shall
place
it
on
*NL*
that
table
,
and
you
may
remain
between
it
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
offered
the
weapon
to
Milady
,
who
examined
the
temper
of
it
*NL*
attentively
,
and
who
tried
the
point
on
the
tip
of
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
returning
the
knife
to
the
young
officer
,
``
this
is
*NL*
fine
and
good
steel
.
You
are
a
faithful
friend
,
Felton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
took
back
the
weapon
,
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
,
as
he
had
*NL*
agreed
with
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
followed
him
with
her
eyes
,
and
made
a
gesture
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
she
,
``
listen
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
request
was
needless
.
The
young
officer
stood
upright
before
her
,
*NL*
awaiting
her
words
as
if
to
devour
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felton
,
''
said
Milady
,
with
a
solemnity
full
of
melancholy
,
``
imagine
*NL*
that
your
sister
,
the
daughter
of
your
father
,
speaks
to
you
.
While
yet
*NL*
young
,
unfortunately
handsome
,
I
was
dragged
into
a
snare
.
I
resisted
.
*NL*
Ambushes
and
violences
multiplied
around
me
,
but
I
resisted
.
The
*NL*
religion
I
serve
,
the
God
I
adore
,
were
blasphemed
because
I
called
upon
*NL*
that
religion
and
that
God
,
but
still
I
resisted
.
Then
outrages
were
*NL*
heaped
upon
me
,
and
as
my
soul
was
not
subdued
they
wished
to
defile
my
*NL*
body
forever
.
Finally
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
stopped
,
and
a
bitter
smile
passed
over
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finally
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
finally
,
what
did
they
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
length
,
one
evening
my
enemy
resolved
to
paralyze
the
resistance
he
*NL*
could
not
conquer
.
One
evening
he
mixed
a
powerful
narcotic
with
my
*NL*
water
.
Scarcely
had
I
finished
my
repast
,
when
I
felt
myself
sink
by
*NL*
degrees
into
a
strange
torpor
.
Although
I
was
without
mistrust
,
a
vague
*NL*
fear
seized
me
,
and
I
tried
to
struggle
against
sleepiness
.
I
arose
.
I
*NL*
wished
to
run
to
the
window
and
call
for
help
,
but
my
legs
refused
their
*NL*
office
.
It
appeared
as
if
the
ceiling
sank
upon
my
head
and
crushed
me
*NL*
with
its
weight
.
I
stretched
out
my
arms
.
I
tried
to
speak
.
I
could
only
*NL*
utter
inarticulate
sounds
,
and
irresistible
faintness
came
over
me
.
I
*NL*
supported
myself
by
a
chair
,
feeling
that
I
was
about
to
fall
,
but
this
*NL*
support
was
soon
insufficient
on
account
of
my
weak
arms
.
I
fell
upon
*NL*
one
knee
,
then
upon
both
.
I
tried
to
pray
,
but
my
tongue
was
frozen
.
God
*NL*
doubtless
neither
heard
nor
saw
me
,
and
I
sank
upon
the
floor
a
prey
to
*NL*
a
slumber
which
resembled
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
all
that
passed
in
that
sleep
,
or
the
time
which
glided
away
while
*NL*
it
lasted
,
I
have
no
remembrance
.
The
only
thing
I
recollect
is
that
I
*NL*
awoke
in
bed
in
a
round
chamber
,
the
furniture
of
which
was
sumptuous
,
*NL*
and
into
which
light
only
penetrated
by
an
opening
in
the
ceiling
.
No
*NL*
door
gave
entrance
to
the
room
.
It
might
be
called
a
magnificent
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
long
time
before
I
was
able
to
make
out
what
place
I
was
in
,
*NL*
or
to
take
account
of
the
details
I
describe
.
My
mind
appeared
to
strive
*NL*
in
vain
to
shake
off
the
heavy
darkness
of
the
sleep
from
which
I
could
*NL*
not
rouse
myself
.
I
had
vague
perceptions
of
space
traversed
,
of
the
*NL*
rolling
of
a
carriage
,
of
a
horrible
dream
in
which
my
strength
had
*NL*
become
exhausted
;
but
all
this
was
so
dark
and
so
indistinct
in
my
mind
*NL*
that
these
events
seemed
to
belong
to
another
life
than
mine
,
and
yet
*NL*
mixed
with
mine
in
fantastic
duality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
times
the
state
into
which
I
had
fallen
appeared
so
strange
that
I
*NL*
believed
myself
dreaming
.
I
arose
trembling
.
My
clothes
were
near
me
on
*NL*
a
chair
;
I
neither
remembered
having
undressed
myself
nor
going
to
bed
.
*NL*
Then
by
degrees
the
reality
broke
upon
me
,
full
of
chaste
terrors
.
I
was
*NL*
no
longer
in
the
house
where
I
had
dwelt
.
As
well
as
I
could
judge
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
sun
,
the
day
was
already
two-thirds
gone
.
It
was
the
*NL*
evening
before
when
I
had
fallen
asleep
;
my
sleep
,
then
,
must
have
*NL*
lasted
twenty-four
hours
!
What
had
taken
place
during
this
long
sleep
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dressed
myself
as
quickly
as
possible
;
my
slow
and
stiff
motions
all
*NL*
attested
that
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
were
not
yet
entirely
*NL*
dissipated
.
The
chamber
was
evidently
furnished
for
the
reception
of
a
*NL*
woman
;
and
the
most
finished
coquette
could
not
have
formed
a
wish
,
but
*NL*
on
casting
her
eyes
about
the
apartment
,
she
would
have
found
that
wish
*NL*
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
was
not
the
first
captive
that
had
been
shut
up
in
this
*NL*
splendid
prison
;
but
you
may
easily
comprehend
,
Felton
,
that
the
more
*NL*
superb
the
prison
,
the
greater
was
my
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
a
prison
,
for
I
tried
in
vain
to
get
out
of
it
.
I
sounded
*NL*
all
the
walls
,
in
the
hopes
of
discovering
a
door
,
but
everywhere
the
*NL*
walls
returned
a
full
and
flat
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
the
tour
of
the
room
at
least
twenty
times
,
in
search
of
an
*NL*
outlet
of
some
kind
;
but
there
was
none
.
I
sank
exhausted
with
fatigue
*NL*
and
terror
into
an
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meantime
,
night
came
on
rapidly
,
and
with
night
my
terrors
increased
.
I
*NL*
did
not
know
but
I
had
better
remain
where
I
was
seated
.
It
appeared
*NL*
that
I
was
surrounded
with
unknown
dangers
into
which
I
was
about
to
*NL*
fall
at
every
instant
.
Although
I
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
evening
*NL*
before
,
my
fears
prevented
my
feeling
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
noise
from
without
by
which
I
could
measure
the
time
reached
me
;
I
*NL*
only
supposed
it
must
be
seven
or
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
for
it
*NL*
was
in
the
month
of
October
and
it
was
quite
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
at
once
the
noise
of
a
door
,
turning
on
its
hinges
,
made
me
start
.
*NL*
A
globe
of
fire
appeared
above
the
glazed
opening
of
the
ceiling
,
*NL*
casting
a
strong
light
into
my
chamber
;
and
I
perceived
with
terror
that
*NL*
a
man
was
standing
within
a
few
paces
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
table
,
with
two
covers
,
bearing
a
supper
ready
prepared
,
stood
,
as
if
*NL*
by
magic
,
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
was
he
who
had
pursued
me
during
a
whole
year
,
who
had
vowed
*NL*
my
dishonor
,
and
who
,
by
the
first
words
that
issued
from
his
mouth
,
*NL*
gave
me
to
understand
he
had
accomplished
it
the
preceding
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scoundrel
!
''
murmured
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
scoundrel
!
''
cried
Milady
,
seeing
the
interest
which
the
young
*NL*
officer
,
whose
soul
seemed
to
hang
on
her
lips
,
took
in
this
strange
*NL*
recital
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
scoundrel
!
He
believed
,
having
triumphed
over
me
in
*NL*
my
sleep
,
that
all
was
completed
.
He
came
,
hoping
that
I
would
accept
my
*NL*
shame
,
as
my
shame
was
consummated
;
he
came
to
offer
his
fortune
in
*NL*
exchange
for
my
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
the
heart
of
a
woman
could
contain
of
haughty
contempt
and
*NL*
disdainful
words
,
I
poured
out
upon
this
man
.
Doubtless
he
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
such
reproaches
,
for
he
listened
to
me
calm
and
smiling
,
*NL*
with
his
arms
crossed
over
his
breast
.
Then
,
when
he
thought
I
had
said
*NL*
all
,
he
advanced
toward
me
;
I
sprang
toward
the
table
,
I
seized
a
knife
,
*NL*
I
placed
it
to
my
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
one
step
more
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
in
addition
to
my
dishonor
,
you
shall
*NL*
have
my
death
to
reproach
yourself
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
,
no
doubt
,
in
my
look
,
my
voice
,
my
whole
person
,
that
*NL*
sincerity
of
gesture
,
of
attitude
,
of
accent
,
which
carries
conviction
*NL*
to
the
most
perverse
minds
,
for
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Your
death
?
'
said
he
;
`
oh
,
no
,
you
are
too
charming
a
mistress
to
*NL*
allow
me
to
consent
to
lose
you
thus
,
after
I
have
had
the
happiness
to
*NL*
possess
you
only
a
single
time
.
Adieu
,
my
charmer
;
I
will
wait
to
pay
*NL*
you
my
next
visit
till
you
are
in
a
better
humor

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
these
words
he
blew
a
whistle
;
the
globe
of
fire
which
lighted
the
*NL*
room
reascended
and
disappeared
.
I
found
myself
again
in
complete
*NL*
darkness
.
The
same
noise
of
a
door
opening
and
shutting
was
repeated
the
*NL*
instant
afterward
;
the
flaming
globe
descended
afresh
,
and
I
was
*NL*
completely
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
moment
was
frightful
;
if
I
had
any
doubts
as
to
my
misfortune
,
*NL*
these
doubts
had
vanished
in
an
overwhelming
reality
.
I
was
in
the
power
*NL*
of
a
man
whom
I
not
only
detested
,
but
despised
--
of
a
man
capable
of
*NL*
anything
,
and
who
had
already
given
me
a
fatal
proof
of
what
he
was
able
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
,
then
was
this
man
?
''
asked
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
passed
the
night
on
a
chair
,
starting
at
the
least
noise
,
for
toward
*NL*
midnight
the
lamp
went
out
,
and
I
was
again
in
darkness
.
But
the
night
*NL*
passed
away
without
any
fresh
attempt
on
the
part
of
my
persecutor
.
Day
*NL*
came
;
the
table
had
disappeared
,
only
I
had
still
the
knife
in
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
knife
was
my
only
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
.
Sleeplessness
inflamed
my
eyes
;
I
had
not
*NL*
dared
to
sleep
a
single
instant
.
The
light
of
day
reassured
me
;
I
went
*NL*
and
threw
myself
on
the
bed
,
without
parting
with
the
emancipating
*NL*
knife
,
which
I
concealed
under
my
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
awoke
,
a
fresh
meal
was
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
time
,
in
spite
of
my
terrors
,
in
spite
of
my
agony
,
I
began
to
*NL*
feel
a
devouring
hunger
.
It
was
forty-eight
hours
since
I
had
taken
any
*NL*
nourishment
.
I
ate
some
bread
and
some
fruit
;
then
,
remembering
the
*NL*
narcotic
mixed
with
the
water
I
had
drunk
,
I
would
not
touch
that
which
*NL*
was
placed
on
the
table
,
but
filled
my
glass
at
a
marble
fountain
fixed
*NL*
in
the
wall
over
my
dressing
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
notwithstanding
these
precautions
,
I
remained
for
some
time
in
*NL*
a
terrible
agitation
of
mind
.
But
my
fears
were
this
time
ill-founded
;
I
*NL*
passed
the
day
without
experiencing
anything
of
the
kind
I
dreaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
precaution
to
half
empty
the
carafe
,
in
order
that
my
*NL*
suspicions
might
not
be
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
evening
came
on
,
and
with
it
darkness
;
but
however
profound
was
*NL*
this
darkness
,
my
eyes
began
to
accustom
themselves
to
it
.
I
saw
,
amid
*NL*
the
shadows
,
the
table
sink
through
the
floor
;
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
later
it
reappeared
,
bearing
my
supper
.
In
an
instant
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
lamp
,
my
chamber
was
once
more
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
determined
to
eat
only
such
things
as
could
not
possibly
have
*NL*
anything
soporific
introduced
into
them
.
Two
eggs
and
some
fruit
*NL*
composed
my
repast
;
then
I
drew
another
glass
of
water
from
my
*NL*
protecting
fountain
,
and
drank
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
first
swallow
,
it
appeared
to
me
not
to
have
the
same
taste
as
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
Suspicion
instantly
seized
me
.
I
paused
,
but
I
had
*NL*
already
drunk
half
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
threw
the
rest
away
with
horror

waited

with
the
dew
of
fear
*NL*
upon
my
brow

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
some
invisible
witness
had
seen
me
draw
the
water
from
that
*NL*
fountain

had
taken
advantage
of
my
confidence
in
it
,
the
better
to
*NL*
assure
my
ruin
,
so
coolly
resolved
upon
,
so
cruelly
pursued

*NL*
``
Half
an
hour
had
not
passed
when
the
same
symptoms
began
to
appear
;
but
*NL*
as
I
had
only
drunk
half
a
glass
of
the
water
,
I
contended
longer
,
and
*NL*
instead
of
falling
entirely
asleep
,
I
sank
into
a
state
of
drowsiness
*NL*
which
left
me
a
perception
of
what
was
passing
around
me
,
while
*NL*
depriving
me
of
the
strength
either
to
defend
myself
or
to
fly
.

*NL*
``
I
dragged
myself
toward
the
bed

to
seek
the
only
defense
I
had
*NL*
left

my
saving
knife
;
but
I
could
not
reach
the
bolster
.
I
sank
on
my
*NL*
knees
,
my
hands
clasped
round
one
of
the
bedposts
;
then
I
felt
that
I
*NL*
was
lost

*NL*
*NL*
Felton
became
frightfully
pale
,
and
a
convulsive
tremor
crept
through
*NL*
his
whole
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
most
frightful
,
''
continued
Milady
,
her
voice
altered
,
as
*NL*
if
she
still
experienced
the
same
agony
as
at
that
awful
minute
,
``
was
*NL*
that
at
this
time
I
retained
a
consciousness
of
the
danger
that
*NL*
threatened
me
;
was
that
my
soul
,
if
I
may
say
so
,
waked
in
my
sleeping
*NL*
body
;
was
that
I
saw
,
that
I
heard

It
is
true
that
all
was
like
a
*NL*
dream
,
but
it
was
not
the
less
frightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
the
lamp
ascend
,
and
leave
me
in
darkness

then
I
heard
the
*NL*
well-known
creaking
of
the
door
although
I
had
heard
that
door
open
but
*NL*
twice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
instinctively
that
someone
approached
me

it
is
said
that
the
*NL*
doomed
wretch
in
the
deserts
of
America
thus
feels
the
approach
of
the
*NL*
serpent

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wished
to
make
an
effort
;
I
attempted
to
cry
out

By
an
incredible
*NL*
effort
of
will
I
even
raised
myself
up
,
but
only
to
sink
down
again
*NL*
immediately
,
and
to
fall
into
the
arms
of
my
persecutor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
who
this
man
was

the
young
officer

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
saw
at
a
single
glance
all
the
painful
feelings
she
inspired
in
*NL*
Felton
by
dwelling
on
every
detail
of
her
recital
;

she
would
not
*NL*
spare
him
a
single
pang
.
The
more
profoundly
she
wounded
his
heart
,
the
*NL*
more
certainly
he
would
avenge
her
.
She
continued
,
then
,
as
if
she
had
*NL*
not
heard
his
exclamation
,
or
as
if
she
thought
the
moment
was
not
yet
*NL*
come
to
reply
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
this
time
it
was
no
longer
an
inert
body

without
feeling

the
villain
had
to
deal
with

I
have
told
you
that
without
being
able
to
*NL*
regain
the
complete
exercise
of
my
faculties
,
I
retained
the
sense
of
my
*NL*
danger

I
struggled
,
then
,
with
all
my
strength

and
doubtless
opposed
,
*NL*
weak
as
I
was

a
long
resistance

I
heard
him
cry
out

These
*NL*
miserable
Puritans

knew
very
well
that
they
tired
out
their

executioners

not

strong
against

*NL*
``
Alas
!
this
desperate
resistance
could
not

felt
my
strength

fail

this
time

was
not
my
sleep

enabled
the
coward
to
*NL*
prevail

my
swoon

*NL*
*NL*
Felton
listened
without
uttering
any
word
or
sound
,
except
an
inward
*NL*
expression
of
agony
.
The
sweat
streamed
down
his
marble
forehead
,
and
*NL*
his
hand
,
under
his
coat
,
tore
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
first
impulse

on
coming
to
myself

to
feel
under
my
pillow

not
been
able
to
reach

if
it
had
not
been
useful
for

defense

it
might
at

serve
for
expiation

``
But
on
taking
this
knife

Felton

a
terrible
idea
occurred
to
me

sworn
to
tell
you
all

I
will
tell
you
all

that
eternal

lion
roaring

In

what
shall
I
*NL*
say
to
you

continued
Milady
,
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
accusing
*NL*
herself
of
a
crime

``
This

occurred
to
me

leave

of

homicidal

I
now
bear
the
punishment

Continue

Oh

no

return
the
following

During

I
had
nothing

to
fear

``
When
the
hour
of
breakfast
came

I
did
not
hesitate
to
eat

drink

I
had
determined
to
make

to
eat
nothing

I
*NL*
was
forced

to
combat
the
fast

the
nourishment

of
the
morning

*NL*
*NL*

Only
I
concealed
a
glass

water

remained
after

breakfast

thirst
having
been
the

of
my
sufferings

I
remained

forty-eight

without

The
day
passed
away

having
any

had
formed

only
I
took
care
that
my
face

should
not
betray
the

I
had
no

I
was

watched

I
felt
a
smile
on
my

Felton

I
dare
*NL*
not
tell
you

I
smiled

you
would
hold
me
in
horror

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

Felton

Evening
came
;
the
ordinary
events
took
place

During
the
darkness
,
as
*NL*
before

my
supper
was
brought
.
Then
the
lamp
was
lighted
,
and
I
sat
down
*NL*
to
table
.
I
only
ate
some
fruit
.
I
pretended
to
pour
out
water
from
the
*NL*
jug
,
but
I
only
drank
that
which
I
had
saved
in
my
glass

The
*NL*
substitution
was
made
so
carefully
that
my
spies
,
if
I
had
any
,
could
*NL*
have
no
suspicion
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
supper
I
exhibited
the
same
marks
of
languor
as
on
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
;
but
this
time
,
as
I
yielded
to
fatigue
,
or
as
if
I
had
become
*NL*
familiarized
with
danger
,
I
dragged
myself
toward
my
bed
,
let
my
robe
*NL*
fall
,
and
lay
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
my
knife
where
I
had
placed
it

under
my
pillow

while
*NL*
feigning
to
sleep
,
my
hand
grasped
the
handle
of
it
convulsively

*NL*
*NL*
``
Two

passed
away
without
anything
fresh
happening

Oh

who
*NL*
could
have
said
so
the
evening
before

I
began
to
fear
that
he
would
not
*NL*
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
At
length
I
saw
the
lamp
rise
softly
,

disappear
in
the
depths
of
*NL*
the
ceiling
;
my
chamber
was
filled
with
darkness

obscurity
,

I
*NL*
made
a
strong
effort
to
penetrate
this
darkness

obscurity

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
ten
minutes
passed
;
I
heard
no
other
noise

the
beating

my

own
heart

I
implored
heaven
that
he
might
come

*NL*
``
At
length
I
heard
the
well-known
noise

the
door

opened

*NL*
shut

I
heard
,
notwithstanding
the
thickness
of
the
carpet

a
step

*NL*
made
the
floor
creak

saw

approached

Haste

Then

continued
Milady

``
then
I
collected
all

to
my

the
moment

of
justice

had
*NL*
struck

I
looked
upon
myself

I
gathered
myself
up

my
*NL*
knife
in
my
hand

when
I
saw
him
near

stretching
out
his

*NL*
find
his
victim

then
,
with
the
last
cry

despair

I
struck

him
in

his
breast

You
are

said
he
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
`
and
you
shall
*NL*
undergo
the
punishment
of
prostitutes
!
Branded
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
*NL*
you
invoke
,
try
to
prove
to
that
world
that
you
are
neither
guilty

mad
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
addressing
the
man
who
accompanied
him
,
`
Executioner
,

said
he
,
*NL*
`
do
your
duty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

his

his

cried
Felton
.
``
His

tell
it
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
in
spite
of
my
cries
,
in
spite
of
my
resistance
--
for
I
began
to
*NL*
comprehend
that
there
was
a
question
of
something
worse
than
death
--
the
*NL*
executioner
seized
me
,
threw
me
on
the
floor
,
fastened
me
with
his
*NL*
bonds
,
and
suffocated
by
sobs
,
almost
without
sense
,
invoking
God
,
who
*NL*
did
not
listen
to
me
,
I
uttered
all
at
once
a
frightful
cry
of
pain
and
*NL*
shame
.
A
burning
fire
,
a
red-hot
iron
,
the
iron
of
the
executioner
,
was
*NL*
imprinted
on
my
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
uttered
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
Milady
,
rising
with
the
majesty
of
a
queen
,
``
here
,
Felton
,
*NL*
behold
the
new
martyrdom
invented
for
a
pure
young
girl
,
the
victim
of
*NL*
the
brutality
of
a
villain
.
Learn
to
know
the
heart
of
men
,
and
*NL*
henceforth
make
yourself
less
easily
the
instrument
of
their
unjust
*NL*
vengeance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
with
a
rapid
gesture
,
opened
her
robe
,
tore
the
cambric
that
*NL*
covered
her
bosom
,
and
red
with
feigned
anger
and
simulated
shame
,
*NL*
showed
the
young
man
the
ineffaceable
impression
which
dishonored
that
*NL*
beautiful
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
cried
Felton
,
``
that
is
a
FLEUR-DE-LIS
which
I
see
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
therein
consisted
the
infamy
,
''
replied
Milady
.
``
The
brand
of
*NL*
England
!
--
it
would
be
necessary
to
prove
what
tribunal
had
imposed
it
on
*NL*
me
,
and
I
could
have
made
a
public
appeal
to
all
the
tribunals
of
the
*NL*
kingdom
;
but
the
brand
of
France
!
--
oh
,
by
that
,
by
THAT
I
was
branded
*NL*
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
too
much
for
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pale
,
motionless
,
overwhelmed
by
this
frightful
revelation
,
dazzled
by
*NL*
the
superhuman
beauty
of
this
woman
who
unveiled
herself
before
him
with
*NL*
an
immodesty
which
appeared
to
him
sublime
,
he
ended
by
falling
on
his
*NL*
knees
before
her
as
the
early
Christians
did
before
those
pure
and
holy
*NL*
martyrs
whom
the
persecution
of
the
emperors
gave
up
in
the
circus
to
*NL*
the
sanguinary
sensuality
of
the
populace
.
The
brand
disappeared
;
the
*NL*
beauty
alone
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
!
Pardon
!
''
cried
Felton
,
``
oh
,
pardon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
read
in
his
eyes
LOVE
!
LOVE
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
for
what
?
''
asked
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
for
having
joined
with
your
persecutors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
held
out
her
hand
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
beautiful
!
so
young
!
''
cried
Felton
,
covering
that
hand
with
his
*NL*
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
let
one
of
those
looks
fall
upon
him
which
make
a
slave
of
a
*NL*
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
was
a
Puritan
;
he
abandoned
the
hand
of
this
woman
to
kiss
her
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
no
longer
loved
her
;
he
adored
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
crisis
was
past
,
when
Milady
appeared
to
have
resumed
her
*NL*
self-possession
,
which
she
had
never
lost
;
when
Felton
had
seen
her
*NL*
recover
with
the
veil
of
chastity
those
treasures
of
love
which
were
*NL*
only
concealed
from
him
to
make
him
desire
them
the
more
ardently
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Ah
,
now
!
I
have
only
one
thing
to
ask
of
you
;
that
is

the
name

of
your
true
executioner
.
For
to
me
there
is
but
one
;
the
other
was
an
*NL*
instrument
,
that
was
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

brother

cried
Milady
,
``
must
I
name
him
again

Have
you
not
yet

divined
who

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

cried
Felton

What

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Milady

about

*NL*
*NL*
``
Buckingham

It

cried
Felton
,
in
a
high
state
of
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
concealed
her
face
in
her
hands
,
as
if
she
could
not
endure
the
*NL*
shame
which
this
name
recalled
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buckingham

the
executioner
of
this
angelic
creature

cried
Felton
.
*NL*
``
And
thou
hast
not
hurled
thy
thunder
at
him

my
God

And
thou

left

honored

powerful

ruin

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
abandons
him
who
abandons

said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
will
draw
upon
his
head
the
punishment
reserved
for
the
damned

*NL*
said
Felton
,
with
increasing
exultation
.
``
He
wills
that
human
vengeance

precede
celestial
justice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
fear

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

said
Felton
,
``
I
do
not
fear
him

nor
will
I
spare
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soul
of
Milady
was
bathed
in
an
infernal
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
Lord
de
Winter
,
my
protector
,
my
father
,
''
asked
Felton
,
*NL*
``
possibly
be
mixed
up
with
all
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

Felton

''
resumed
Milady
,
``
for
by
the
side
of
base
and
*NL*
contemptible
men
there
are
often
found
great

generous
natures

I
had
*NL*
an
affianced
husband
,
a
man
whom
I
loved
,
and
who
loved
me
--
a
heart
like
*NL*
yours
,
Felton

a
man
like
you

I
went
to
him
and
told
him
all
;
he
knew
*NL*
me
,
that
man
did

and
did
not
doubt
an
instant
.
He
was
a
nobleman
,
a
man
*NL*
equal
to
Buckingham
in
every
respect
.
He
said
nothing
;
he
only
girded
on
*NL*
his
sword
,
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
,
and
went
straight
to
Buckingham
*NL*
Palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

Felton

``
I
understand

But
with
such

not

it

the
poniard

*NL*
``
Buckingham
had
left

let

nearly
a
year
absent

A
week
before
his
*NL*
return
Lord

died

leaving
me
his
sole
heir

Whence
came
the
*NL*
blow

God

knows
without

``
Oh

an
abyss

cried
Felton

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
de
Winter
died
without
revealing
anything

The

terrible
secret
was
to
be
concealed
till
it
burst
,
like
a
clap
of
*NL*
thunder
,
over
the
head
of
the
guilty
.
Your
protector
had
seen
with
pain
*NL*
this
marriage
of
his
elder
brother
with
a
portionless
girl

I
was
*NL*
sensible
that
I
could
look
for
no
support
from
a
man
disappointed
in
his
*NL*
hopes
of
an
inheritance

I
went
to
France

with
a
determination
to
*NL*
remain
there
for
the
rest
of
my
life

But
all
my
fortune
is
in
England
.
*NL*
Communication
being
closed
by
the
war

I
was
in
want
of
everything
.
I
*NL*
was
then
obliged
to
come
back
again

Six
days
ago
,
I
landed
at
*NL*
Portsmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
Buckingham
heard
by
some
means
,
no
doubt
,
of
my
return
.
He
spoke
*NL*
of
me
to
Lord
de
Winter
,
already
prejudiced
against
me
,
and
told
him
*NL*
that
his
sister-in-law
was
a
prostitute
,
a
branded
woman
.
The
noble
and
*NL*
pure
voice
of
my
husband
was
no

here
to
defend
me

Lord
de
Winter
*NL*
believed
all
that
was
told
him
with
so
much
the
more
ease
that
it
was
*NL*
his
interest
to
believe
it
.
He
caused
me
to
be
arrested
,
had
me
*NL*
conducted
hither
,
and
placed
me
under
your
guard
.
You
know
the
rest

The
*NL*
day
after
tomorrow
he
banishes
me
,
he
transports
me
;
the
day
after

tomorrow
he
exiles
me
among
the
infamous

Oh
,
the
train
is
well
laid

*NL*
the
plot
is
clever

My
honor

not

it

*NL*
I
can
do
nothing

die

give
me
that
knife

*NL*
*NL*
And
at
these
words
,
as
if
all
her
strength
was
exhausted
,
Milady
sank
,
*NL*
weak
and
languishing
,
into
the
arms
of
the
young
officer
,
who
,
*NL*
intoxicated
with
love
,
anger
,
and
voluptuous
sensations
hitherto
*NL*
unknown
,
received
her
with
transport
,
pressed
her
against
his
heart
,
all
*NL*
trembling
at
the
breath
from
that
charming
mouth
,
bewildered
by
the
*NL*
contact
with
that
palpitating
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

said
he

``
No

pure

live

to
triumph
over
your
enemies

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
put
him
from
her
slowly
with
her
hand
,
while
drawing
him
nearer
*NL*
with
her
look
;
but
Felton
,
in
his
turn
,
embraced
her
more
closely
,
*NL*
imploring
her
like
a
divinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
death
,
death
!
''
said
she
,
lowering
her
voice
and
her
eyelids
,
``
oh
,
*NL*
death
,
rather
than
shame
!
Felton

my
brother

my
friend

I
conjure
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried
Felton

``
no

you
shall
live

be
avenged

*NL*
*NL*
``
Felton

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

we
will
live

die
together

cried
he
,
pressing
his
lips
*NL*
to
those
of
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
strokes
resounded
on
the
door
;
this
time
Milady
really
pushed
*NL*
him
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
,
''
said
she
,
``
we
have
been

Someone
is
coming

All
is
*NL*
over

We
are
lost

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Felton
;
it
is
only
the
sentinel
warning
me
that
they
are
*NL*
about
to
change
the
guard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
run
to
the
door

open
it
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
Felton
obeyed
;
this
woman
was
now
his
whole
thought
,
his
whole
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
sergeant
commanding
a
watch-patrol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
the
young
lieutenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
me
to
open
the
door
if
I
heard
anyone
cry
out
,
''
said
the
*NL*
soldier
;
``
but
you
forgot
to
leave
me
the
key
.
I
heard
you
cry
out
,
*NL*
without
understanding
what
you
said
.
I
tried
to
open
the
door
,
but
it
*NL*
was
locked
inside
;
then
I
called
the
sergeant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
I
am
,
''
said
the
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
,
quite
bewildered
,
almost
mad
,
stood
speechless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
plainly
perceived
that
it
was
now
her
turn
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
scene
.
She
ran
to
the
table
,
and
seizing
the
knife
which
Felton
had
laid
*NL*
down
,
exclaimed
,
``
And
by
what
right
will
you
prevent
me
from
dying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
''
exclaimed
Felton
,
on
seeing
the
knife
glitter
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
burst
of
ironical
laughter
resounded
through
the
*NL*
corridor
.
The
baron
,
attracted
by
the
noise
,
in
his
chamber
gown
,
his
*NL*
sword
under
his
arm
,
stood
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

''
said
he
,
``
here
we
are
,
at
the
last
act

the
tragedy

You
see

Felton

drama
has
gone
through
all
the
phases
I
named
;
but
be
easy
,
*NL*
no
blood
will
flow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
perceived
that
all
was
lost
unless
she
gave
Felton
an
immediate
*NL*
and
terrible
proof
of
her
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

flow
;
and
may
that
blood
fall
*NL*
back
on
those
who
cause
it
to
flow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
uttered
a
cry
,
and
rushed
toward
her
.
He
was
too
late
;
Milady
had
*NL*
stabbed
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
knife
had
fortunately
,
we
ought
to
say
skillfully
,
come
in
*NL*
contact
with
the
steel
busk
,
which
at
that
period
,
like
a
cuirass
,
*NL*
defended
the
chests
of
women
.
It
had
glided
down
it
,
tearing
the
robe
,
*NL*
and
had
penetrated
slantingly
between
the
flesh
and
the
ribs
.
Milady
's
*NL*
robe
was
not
the
less
stained
with
blood
in
a
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
fell
down
,
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
swoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
snatched
away
the
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
my
Lord
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
deep
,
gloomy
tone
,
``
here
is
a
woman
who
*NL*
was
under
my
guard
,
and
who
has
killed
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
at
ease
,
Felton
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
She
is
not
dead
;
demons
do
*NL*
not
die
so
easily
.
Be
tranquil
,
and
go
wait
for
me
in
my
chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
Lord
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
sir
,
I
command
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
injunction
from
his
superior
,
Felton
obeyed
;
but
in
going
out
,
*NL*
he
put
the
knife
into
his
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Lord
de
Winter
,
he
contented
himself
with
calling
the
woman
who
*NL*
waited
on
Milady
,
and
when
she
was
come
,
he
recommended
the
prisoner
,
*NL*
who
was
still
fainting
,
to
her
care
,
and
left
them
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
all
things
considered
and
notwithstanding
his
suspicions
,
as
*NL*
the
wound
might
be
serious
,
he
immediately
sent
off
a
mounted
man
to
*NL*
find
a
physician
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

ESCAPE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Lord
de
Winter
had
thought
,
Milady
's
wound
was
not
dangerous
.
So
soon
*NL*
as
she
was
left
alone
with
the
woman
whom
the
baron
had
summoned
to
her
*NL*
assistance
she
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
however
,
necessary
to
affect
weakness
and
pain
--
not
a
very
*NL*
difficult
task
for
so
finished
an
actress
as
Milady
.
Thus
the
poor
woman
*NL*
was
completely
the
dupe
of
the
prisoner
,
whom
,
notwithstanding
her
*NL*
hints
,
she
persisted
in
watching
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
presence
of
this
woman
did
not
prevent
Milady
from
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
longer
a
doubt
that
Felton
was
convinced
;
Felton
was
hers
.
*NL*
If
an
angel
appeared
to
that
young
man
as
an
accuser
of
Milady
,
he
would
*NL*
take
him
,
in
the
mental
disposition
in
which
he
now
found
himself
,
for
a
*NL*
messenger
sent
by
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
smiled
at
this
thought
,
for
Felton
was
now
her
only
hope
--
her
*NL*
only
means
of
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Lord
de
Winter
might
suspect
him
;
Felton
himself
might
now
be
*NL*
watched
!
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
doctor
arrived
;
but
since
the
*NL*
time
Milady
stabbed
herself
,
however
short
,
the
wound
had
closed
.
The
*NL*
doctor
could
therefore
measure
neither
the
direction
nor
the
depth
of
*NL*
it
;
he
only
satisfied
himself
by
Milady
's
pulse
that
the
case
was
not
*NL*
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Milady
,
under
the
pretext
that
she
had
not
slept
well
in
*NL*
the
night
and
wanted
rest
,
sent
away
the
woman
who
attended
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
one
hope
,
which
was
that
Felton
would
appear
at
the
breakfast
*NL*
hour
;
but
Felton
did
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
her
fears
realized
?
Was
Felton
,
suspected
by
the
baron
,
about
to
*NL*
fail
her
at
the
decisive
moment
?
She
had
only
one
day
left
.
Lord
de
*NL*
Winter
had
announced
her
embarkation
for
the
twenty-third
,
and
it
was
*NL*
now
the
morning
of
the
twenty-second
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
she
still
waited
patiently
till
the
hour
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
had
eaten
nothing
in
the
morning
,
the
dinner
was
brought
in
*NL*
at
its
usual
time
.
Milady
then
perceived
,
with
terror
,
that
the
uniform
*NL*
of
the
soldiers
who
guarded
her
was
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
ventured
to
ask
what
had
become
of
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
told
that
he
had
left
the
castle
an
hour
before
on
horseback
.
*NL*
She
inquired
if
the
baron
was
still
at
the
castle
.
The
soldier
replied
*NL*
that
he
was
,
and
that
he
had
given
orders
to
be
informed
if
the
prisoner
*NL*
wished
to
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
replied
that
she
was
too
weak
at
present
,
and
that
her
only
*NL*
desire
was
to
be
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
went
out
,
leaving
the
dinner
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
was
sent
away
.
The
marines
were
removed
.
Felton
was
then
*NL*
mistrusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
blow
to
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
she
arose
.
The
bed
,
which
she
had
kept
from
prudence
and
*NL*
that
they
might
believe
her
seriously
wounded
,
burned
her
like
a
bed
of
*NL*
fire
.
She
cast
a
glance
at
the
door
;
the
baron
had
had
a
plank
nailed
*NL*
over
the
grating
.
He
no
doubt
feared
that
by
this
opening
she
might
*NL*
still
by
some
diabolical
means
corrupt
her
guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
smiled
with
joy
.
She
was
free
now
to
give
way
to
her
transports
*NL*
without
being
observed
.
She
traversed
her
chamber
with
the
excitement
of
*NL*
a
furious
maniac
or
of
a
tigress
shut
up
in
an
iron
cage
.
CERTES
,
if
the
*NL*
knife
had
been
left
in
her
power
,
she
would
now
have
thought
,
not
of
*NL*
killing
herself
,
but
of
killing
the
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
Lord
de
Winter
came
in
.
He
was
armed
at
all
points
.
This
*NL*
man
,
in
whom
Milady
till
that
time
had
only
seen
a
very
simple
*NL*
gentleman
,
had
become
an
admirable
jailer
.
He
appeared
to
foresee
all
,
*NL*
to
divine
all
,
to
anticipate
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
look
at
Milady
apprised
him
of
all
that
was
passing
in
her
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
said
he
,
``
I
see
;
but
you
shall
not
kill
me
today
.
You
have
no
*NL*
longer
a
weapon
;
and
besides
,
I
am
on
my
guard
.
You
had
begun
to
pervert
*NL*
my
poor
Felton
.
He
was
yielding
to
your
infernal
influence
;
but
I
will
*NL*
save
him
.
He
will
never
see
you
again
;
all
is
over
.
Get
your
clothes
*NL*
together
.
Tomorrow
you
will
go
.
I
had
fixed
the
embarkation
for
the
*NL*
twenty-fourth
;
but
I
have
reflected
that
the
more
promptly
the
affair
*NL*
takes
place
the
more
sure
it
will
be
.
Tomorrow
,
by
twelve
o'clock
,
I
*NL*
shall
have
the
order
for
your
exile
,
signed
,
BUCKINGHAM
.
If
you
speak
a
*NL*
single
word
to
anyone
before
going
aboard
ship
,
my
sergeant
will
blow
*NL*
your
brains
out
.
He
has
orders
to
do
so
.
If
when
on
the
ship
you
speak
a
*NL*
single
word
to
anyone
before
the
captain
permits
you
,
the
captain
will
*NL*
have
you
thrown
into
the
sea
.
That
is
agreed
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
AU
REVOIR
;
then
;
that
is
all
I
have
to
say
today
.
Tomorrow
I
will
see
*NL*
you
again
,
to
take
my
leave
.
''
With
these
words
the
baron
went
out
.
*NL*
Milady
had
listened
to
all
this
menacing
tirade
with
a
smile
of
disdain
*NL*
on
her
lips
,
but
rage
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
was
served
.
Milady
felt
that
she
stood
in
need
of
all
her
*NL*
strength
.
She
did
not
know
what
might
take
place
during
this
night
which
*NL*
approached
so
menacingly
--
for
large
masses
of
cloud
rolled
over
the
face
*NL*
of
the
sky
,
and
distant
lightning
announced
a
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
broke
about
ten
o'clock
.
Milady
felt
a
consolation
in
seeing
*NL*
nature
partake
of
the
disorder
of
her
heart
.
The
thunder
growled
in
the
*NL*
air
like
the
passion
and
anger
in
her
thoughts
.
It
appeared
to
her
that
*NL*
the
blast
as
it
swept
along
disheveled
her
brow
,
as
it
bowed
the
*NL*
branches
of
the
trees
and
bore
away
their
leaves
.
She
howled
as
the
*NL*
hurricane
howled
;
and
her
voice
was
lost
in
the
great
voice
of
nature
,
*NL*
which
also
seemed
to
groan
with
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
heard
a
tap
at
her
window
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
she
saw
the
face
of
a
man
appear
behind
the
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
to
the
window
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felton
!
''
cried
she
.
``
I
am
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Felton
;
``
but
silence
,
silence
!
I
must
have
time
to
file
*NL*
through
these
bars
.
Only
take
care
that
I
am
not
seen
through
the
*NL*
wicket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
a
proof
that
the
Lord
is
on
our
side
,
Felton
,
''
replied
*NL*
Milady
.
``
They
have
closed
up
the
grating
with
a
board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
;
God
has
made
them
senseless
,
''
said
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
must
I
do
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
,
only
shut
the
window
.
Go
to
bed
,
or
at
least
lie
down
*NL*
in
your
clothes
.
As
soon
as
I
have
done
I
will
knock
on
one
of
the
panes
*NL*
of
glass
.
But
will
you
be
able
to
follow
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gives
me
pain
,
but
will
not
prevent
my
walking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
ready
,
then
,
at
the
first
signal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
shut
the
window
,
extinguished
the
lamp
,
and
went
,
as
Felton
had
*NL*
desired
her
,
to
lie
down
on
the
bed
.
Amid
the
moaning
of
the
storm
she
*NL*
heard
the
grinding
of
the
file
upon
the
bars
,
and
by
the
light
of
every
*NL*
flash
she
perceived
the
shadow
of
Felton
through
the
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
an
hour
without
breathing
,
panting
,
with
a
cold
sweat
upon
*NL*
her
brow
,
and
her
heart
oppressed
by
frightful
agony
at
every
movement
*NL*
she
heard
in
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
hours
which
last
a
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
,
Felton
tapped
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
sprang
out
of
bed
and
opened
the
window
.
Two
bars
removed
formed
*NL*
an
opening
for
a
man
to
pass
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ready
?
''
asked
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Must
I
take
anything
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
,
if
you
have
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
fortunately
they
have
left
me
all
I
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
,
for
I
have
expended
all
mine
in
chartering
a
*NL*
vessel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
''
said
Milady
,
placing
a
bag
full
of
louis
in
Felton
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
took
the
bag
and
threw
it
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
mounted
upon
a
chair
and
passed
the
upper
part
of
her
body
*NL*
through
the
window
.
She
saw
the
young
officer
suspended
over
the
abyss
*NL*
by
a
ladder
of
ropes
.
For
the
first
time
an
emotion
of
terror
reminded
*NL*
her
that
she
was
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dark
space
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
this
,
''
said
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
it
's
nothing
!
''
said
Milady
.
``
I
will
descend
with
my
eyes
*NL*
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
confidence
in
me
?
''
said
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
your
two
hands
together
.
Cross
them
;
that
's
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
tied
her
two
wrists
together
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
then
with
*NL*
a
cord
over
the
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
asked
Milady
,
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pass
your
arms
around
my
neck
,
and
fear
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
make
you
lose
your
balance
,
and
we
shall
both
be
dashed
to
*NL*
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
am
a
sailor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
second
was
to
be
lost
.
Milady
passed
her
two
arms
round
Felton
's
*NL*
neck
,
and
let
herself
slip
out
of
the
window
.
Felton
began
to
descend
*NL*
the
ladder
slowly
,
step
by
step
.
Despite
the
weight
of
two
bodies
,
the
*NL*
blast
of
the
hurricane
shook
them
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
Felton
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
I
hear
footsteps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
discovered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
of
several
seconds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
it
is
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
,
then
,
is
the
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of
the
patrol
going
their
rounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
their
road
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
under
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
discover
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
if
it
does
not
lighten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
will
run
against
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunately
it
is
too
short
by
six
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
they
are
!
My
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
remained
suspended
,
motionless
and
breathless
,
within
twenty
paces
*NL*
of
the
ground
,
while
the
patrol
passed
beneath
them
laughing
and
*NL*
talking
.
This
was
a
terrible
moment
for
the
fugitives
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
patrol
passed
.
The
noise
of
their
retreating
footsteps
and
the
*NL*
murmur
of
their
voices
soon
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
we
are
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
breathed
a
deep
sigh
and
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
continued
to
descend
.
Near
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
,
when
he
*NL*
found
no
more
support
for
his
feet
,
he
clung
with
his
hands
;
at
length
,
*NL*
arrived
at
the
last
step
,
he
let
himself
hang
by
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
wrists
,
and
touched
the
ground
.
He
stooped
down
,
picked
up
the
bag
of
*NL*
money
,
and
placed
it
between
his
teeth
.
Then
he
took
Milady
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
and
set
off
briskly
in
the
direction
opposite
to
that
which
the
patrol
*NL*
had
taken
.
He
soon
left
the
pathway
of
the
patrol
,
descended
across
the
*NL*
rocks
,
and
when
arrived
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
,
whistled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
similar
signal
replied
to
him
;
and
five
minutes
after
,
a
boat
*NL*
appeared
,
rowed
by
four
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
approached
as
near
as
it
could
to
the
shore
;
but
there
was
not
*NL*
depth
enough
of
water
for
it
to
touch
land
.
Felton
walked
into
the
sea
*NL*
up
to
his
middle
,
being
unwilling
to
trust
his
precious
burden
to
*NL*
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
the
storm
began
to
subside
,
but
still
the
sea
was
disturbed
.
*NL*
The
little
boat
bounded
over
the
waves
like
a
nut-shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
sloop
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
and
row
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
men
bent
to
their
oars
,
but
the
sea
was
too
high
to
let
them
*NL*
get
much
hold
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
they
left
the
castle
behind
;
that
was
the
principal
thing
.
The
*NL*
night
was
extremely
dark
.
It
was
almost
impossible
to
see
the
shore
from
*NL*
the
boat
;
they
would
therefore
be
less
likely
to
see
the
boat
from
the
*NL*
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
black
point
floated
on
the
sea
.
That
was
the
sloop
.
While
the
boat
was
*NL*
advancing
with
all
the
speed
its
four
rowers
could
give
it
,
Felton
*NL*
untied
the
cord
and
then
the
handkerchief
which
bound
Milady
's
hands
*NL*
together
.
When
her
hands
were
loosed
he
took
some
sea
water
and
*NL*
sprinkled
it
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
breathed
a
sigh
,
and
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saved
!
''
replied
the
young
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
saved
,
saved
!
''
cried
she
.
``
Yes
,
there
is
the
sky
;
here
is
the
sea
!
*NL*
The
air
I
breathe
is
the
air
of
liberty
!
Ah
,
thanks
,
Felton
,
thanks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
pressed
her
to
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
with
my
hands
!
''
asked
Milady
;
``
it
seems
as
if
my
*NL*
wrists
had
been
crushed
in
a
vice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
held
out
her
arms
;
her
wrists
were
bruised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Felton
,
looking
at
those
beautiful
hands
,
and
shaking
his
*NL*
head
sorrowfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
,
nothing
!
''
cried
Milady
.
``
I
remember
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
looked
around
her
,
as
if
in
search
of
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
there
,
''
said
Felton
,
touching
the
bag
of
money
with
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
near
to
the
sloop
.
A
sailor
on
watch
hailed
the
boat
;
the
boat
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vessel
is
that
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
I
have
hired
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
will
it
take
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
please
,
after
you
have
put
me
on
shore
at
Portsmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
at
Portsmouth
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Accomplish
the
orders
of
Lord
de
Winter
,
''
said
Felton
,
with
a
gloomy
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
orders
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
understand
?
''
asked
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
explain
yourself
,
I
beg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
he
mistrusted
me
,
he
determined
to
guard
you
himself
,
and
sent
me
in
*NL*
his
place
to
get
Buckingham
to
sign
the
order
for
your
transportation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
mistrusted
you
,
how
could
he
confide
such
an
order
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
know
what
I
was
the
bearer
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
!
And
you
are
going
to
Portsmouth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
time
to
lose
.
Tomorrow
is
the
twenty-third
,
and
Buckingham
*NL*
sets
sail
tomorrow
with
his
fleet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sets
sail
tomorrow
!
Where
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
La
Rochelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
need
not
sail
!
''
cried
Milady
,
forgetting
her
usual
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
satisfied
,
''
replied
Felton
;
``
he
will
not
sail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
started
with
joy
.
She
could
read
to
the
depths
of
the
heart
of
*NL*
this
young
man
;
the
death
of
Buckingham
was
written
there
at
full
*NL*
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Felton
,
''
cried
she
,
``
you
are
as
great
as
Judas
Maccabeus
!
If
you
die
,
I
*NL*
will
die
with
you
;
that
is
all
I
can
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
cried
Felton
;
``
we
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
they
touched
the
sloop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
mounted
the
ladder
first
,
and
gave
his
hand
to
Milady
,
while
the
*NL*
sailors
supported
her
,
for
the
sea
was
still
much
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
after
they
were
on
the
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
this
is
the
person
of
whom
I
spoke
to
you
,
and
*NL*
whom
you
must
convey
safe
and
sound
to
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
thousand
pistoles
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
paid
you
five
hundred
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
correct
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
are
the
other
five
hundred
,
''
replied
Milady
,
placing
her
hand
*NL*
upon
the
bag
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
I
make
but
one
bargain
;
and
I
have
agreed
with
*NL*
this
young
man
that
the
other
five
hundred
shall
not
be
due
to
me
till
*NL*
we
arrive
at
Boulogne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
we
arrive
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safe
and
sound
,
as
true
as
my
name
's
Jack
Butler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
if
you
keep
your
word
,
instead
of
five
hundred
,
I
*NL*
will
give
you
a
thousand
pistoles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
for
you
,
then
,
my
beautiful
lady
,
''
cried
the
captain
;
``
and
may
*NL*
God
often
send
me
such
passengers
as
your
Ladyship
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
convey
me
to
the
little
bay
of
--
;
you
know
it
*NL*
was
agreed
you
should
put
in
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
replied
by
ordering
the
necessary
maneuvers
,
and
toward
*NL*
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
little
vessel
cast
anchor
in
the
bay
*NL*
that
had
been
named
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
passage
,
Felton
related
everything
to
Milady
--
how
,
instead
*NL*
of
going
to
London
,
he
had
chartered
the
little
vessel
;
how
he
had
*NL*
returned
;
how
he
had
scaled
the
wall
by
fastening
cramps
in
the
*NL*
interstices
of
the
stones
,
as
he
ascended
,
to
give
him
foothold
;
and
*NL*
how
,
when
he
had
reached
the
bars
,
he
fastened
his
ladder
.
Milady
knew
*NL*
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
side
,
Milady
tried
to
encourage
Felton
in
his
project
;
but
at
the
*NL*
first
words
which
issued
from
her
mouth
,
she
plainly
saw
that
the
young
*NL*
fanatic
stood
more
in
need
of
being
moderated
than
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
agreed
that
Milady
should
wait
for
Felton
till
ten
o'clock
;
if
he
*NL*
did
not
return
by
ten
o'clock
she
was
to
sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
case
,
and
supposing
he
was
at
liberty
,
he
was
to
rejoin
her
in
*NL*
France
,
at
the
convent
of
the
Carmelites
at
Bethune
.

WHAT
TOOK
PLACE
AT
PORTSMOUTH
AUGUST
23
,
1628
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
took
leave
of
Milady
as
a
brother
about
to
go
for
a
mere
walk
*NL*
takes
leave
of
his
sister
,
kissing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
whole
body
appeared
in
its
ordinary
state
of
calmness
,
only
an
*NL*
unusual
fire
beamed
from
his
eyes
,
like
the
effects
of
a
fever
;
his
brow
*NL*
was
more
pale
than
it
generally
was
;
his
teeth
were
clenched
,
and
his
*NL*
speech
had
a
short
dry
accent
which
indicated
that
something
dark
was
at
*NL*
work
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
he
remained
in
the
boat
which
conveyed
him
to
land
,
he
kept
*NL*
his
face
toward
Milady
,
who
,
standing
on
the
deck
,
followed
him
with
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Both
were
free
from
the
fear
of
pursuit
;
nobody
ever
came
into
*NL*
Milady
's
apartment
before
nine
o'clock
,
and
it
would
require
three
hours
*NL*
to
go
from
the
castle
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
jumped
onshore
,
climbed
the
little
ascent
which
led
to
the
top
of
*NL*
the
cliff
,
saluted
Milady
a
last
time
,
and
took
his
course
toward
the
*NL*
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
hundred
paces
,
the
ground
began
to
decline
,
and
he
could
*NL*
only
see
the
mast
of
the
sloop
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
ran
in
the
direction
of
Portsmouth
,
which
he
saw
at
*NL*
nearly
half
a
league
before
him
,
standing
out
in
the
haze
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
with
its
houses
and
towers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
Portsmouth
the
sea
was
covered
with
vessels
whose
masts
,
like
a
*NL*
forest
of
poplars
despoiled
by
the
winter
,
bent
with
each
breath
of
the
*NL*
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
,
in
his
rapid
walk
,
reviewed
in
his
mind
all
the
accusations
*NL*
against
the
favorite
of
James
I
and
Charles
I
,
furnished
by
two
years
of
*NL*
premature
meditation
and
a
long
sojourn
among
the
Puritans
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
compared
the
public
crimes
of
this
minister
--
startling
crimes
,
*NL*
European
crimes
,
if
so
we
may
say
--
with
the
private
and
unknown
crimes
*NL*
with
which
Milady
had
charged
him
,
Felton
found
that
the
more
culpable
*NL*
of
the
two
men
which
formed
the
character
of
Buckingham
was
the
one
of
*NL*
whom
the
public
knew
not
the
life
.
This
was
because
his
love
,
so
*NL*
strange
,
so
new
,
and
so
ardent
,
made
him
view
the
infamous
and
imaginary
*NL*
accusations
of
Milady
de
Winter
as
,
through
a
magnifying
glass
,
one
*NL*
views
as
frightful
monsters
atoms
in
reality
imperceptible
by
the
side
*NL*
of
an
ant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rapidity
of
his
walk
heated
his
blood
still
more
;
the
idea
that
he
*NL*
left
behind
him
,
exposed
to
a
frightful
vengeance
,
the
woman
he
loved
,
*NL*
or
rather
whom
he
adored
as
a
saint
,
the
emotion
he
had
experienced
,
*NL*
present
fatigue
--
all
together
exalted
his
mind
above
human
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
Portsmouth
about
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
whole
*NL*
population
was
on
foot
;
drums
were
beating
in
the
streets
and
in
the
*NL*
port
;
the
troops
about
to
embark
were
marching
toward
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
arrived
at
the
palace
of
the
Admiralty
,
covered
with
dust
,
and
*NL*
streaming
with
perspiration
.
His
countenance
,
usually
so
pale
,
was
*NL*
purple
with
heat
and
passion
.
The
sentinel
wanted
to
repulse
him
;
but
*NL*
Felton
called
to
the
officer
of
the
post
,
and
drawing
from
his
pocket
*NL*
the
letter
of
which
he
was
the
bearer
,
he
said
,
``
A
pressing
message
from
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
name
of
Lord
de
Winter
,
who
was
known
to
be
one
of
his
Grace
's
*NL*
most
intimate
friends
,
the
officer
of
the
post
gave
orders
to
let
Felton
*NL*
pass
,
who
,
besides
,
wore
the
uniform
of
a
naval
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
darted
into
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
he
entered
the
vestibule
,
another
man
was
entering
*NL*
likewise
,
dusty
,
out
of
breath
,
leaving
at
the
gate
a
post
horse
,
which
,
*NL*
on
reaching
the
palace
,
tumbled
on
his
foreknees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
and
he
addressed
Patrick
,
the
duke
's
confidential
lackey
,
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
.
Felton
named
Lord
de
Winter
;
the
unknown
would
not
name
*NL*
anybody
,
and
pretended
that
it
was
to
the
duke
alone
he
would
make
*NL*
himself
known
.
Each
was
anxious
to
gain
admission
before
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
,
who
knew
Lord
de
Winter
was
in
affairs
of
the
service
,
and
in
*NL*
relations
of
friendship
with
the
duke
,
gave
the
preference
to
the
one
*NL*
who
came
in
his
name
.
The
other
was
forced
to
wait
,
and
it
was
easily
to
*NL*
be
seen
how
he
cursed
the
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
led
Felton
through
a
large
hall
in
which
waited
the
deputies
*NL*
from
La
Rochelle
,
headed
by
the
Prince
de
Soubise
,
and
introduced
him
*NL*
into
a
closet
where
Buckingham
,
just
out
of
the
bath
,
was
finishing
his
*NL*
toilet
,
upon
which
,
as
at
all
times
,
he
bestowed
extraordinary
*NL*
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lieutenant
Felton
,
from
Lord
de
Winter
,
''
said
Patrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Lord
de
Winter
!
''
repeated
Buckingham
;
``
let
him
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
entered
.
At
that
moment
Buckingham
was
throwing
upon
a
couch
a
*NL*
rich
toilet
robe
,
worked
with
gold
,
in
order
to
put
on
a
blue
velvet
*NL*
doublet
embroidered
with
pearls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
the
baron
come
himself
?
''
demanded
Buckingham
.
``
I
expected
*NL*
him
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
desired
me
to
tell
your
Grace
,
''
replied
Felton
,
``
that
he
very
much
*NL*
regretted
not
having
that
honor
,
but
that
he
was
prevented
by
the
guard
*NL*
he
is
obliged
to
keep
at
the
castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
''
said
Buckingham
;
``
he
has
a
prisoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
that
prisoner
that
I
wish
to
speak
to
your
Grace
,
''
replied
*NL*
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
which
I
have
to
say
of
her
can
only
be
heard
by
yourself
,
my
*NL*
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
us
,
Patrick
,
''
said
Buckingham
;
``
but
remain
within
sound
of
the
*NL*
bell
.
I
shall
call
you
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
alone
,
sir
,
''
said
Buckingham
;
``
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord
,
''
said
Felton
,
``
the
Baron
de
Winter
wrote
to
you
the
other
day
*NL*
to
request
you
to
sign
an
order
of
embarkation
relative
to
a
young
woman
*NL*
named
Charlotte
Backson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
and
I
answered
him
,
to
bring
or
send
me
that
order

I
*NL*
would
sign
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
my
Lord

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
''
said
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
it
from
Felton
,
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
over
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
perceiving
that
it
was
the
one
that
had
been
mentioned
to
him
,
he
placed
*NL*
it
on
the
table
,
took
a
pen
,
and
prepared
to
sign
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
my
Lord

''
said
Felton
,
stopping
the
duke
;
``
but
does
your
Grace
*NL*
know
that
the
name
of
Charlotte
Backson
is
not
the
true
name
of
this
*NL*
young
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

I
know
it

replied
the
duke
,
dipping
the
quill
in
the
ink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
Grace
knows
her
real
name

asked
Felton
,
in
a
sharp
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it

;
and
the
duke
put
the
quill
to
the
paper
.
Felton
grew
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
knowing
that
real
name
,
my
Lord

replied
Felton
,
``
will
you
sign
it
*NL*
all
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
,
''
said
Buckingham
,
``
and
rather
twice
than
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
believe
,
''
continued
Felton
,
in
a
voice
that
became
more
sharp
*NL*
and
rough
,
``
that
your
Grace
knows
that
it
is
to
Milady
de
Winter
this
*NL*
relates

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
perfectly

although
I
am
astonished

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
your
Grace
sign
that
order
without
remorse

*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
looked
at
the
young
man
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
you
are
asking
me
very
strange
questions

*NL*
that
I
am
very
foolish
to
answer
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reply
to
them
,
my
Lord

''
said
Felton
;
``
the
circumstances
are
more
*NL*
serious
than
you
perhaps
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
reflected
that
the
young
man
,
coming
from
Lord
de
Winter
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
spoke
in
his
name
,
and
softened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
remorse
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
baron
knows
,
as
well
as
myself
,
that
*NL*
Milady
de
Winter
is
a
very
guilty
woman

and
it
is
treating
her
very
*NL*
favorably
to
commute
her
punishment
to
transportation
.

The
duke
put
his
*NL*
pen
to
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
sign
that
order

my
Lord

Felton

making
a
step
*NL*
toward
the
duke

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
sign
this
order

And
why
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you

look
into
yourself

you
will
do
justice

the

lady

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
do
her
justice
by
sending
her
to
Tyburn

said
Buckingham
.
*NL*
``
This
lady
is
infamous

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

an
angel

her
liberty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah

Are
you
mad

to
talk

thus

Buckingham

*NL*
*NL*

excuse
me

think

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Buckingham

I
really

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

my
Lord

still
plead

I
say
to
you

one
drop
of
water

suffices
to
make
the
full
vase
overflow

one
slight
fault
may
draw
down

punishment
upon
the
head
spared

despite
many
crimes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

Buckingham

you

place
yourself
at

*NL*
*NL*

I
will
exact
nothing

from
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
exact

said
Buckingham
,
looking
at
Felton
with
astonishment
,
*NL*
and
dwelling
upon
each
syllable
of
the
three
words
as
he
pronounced
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Lord

''
continued
Felton
,
becoming
more
excited
as
he
spoke
,
``
my
*NL*
Lord

beware

All
England

tired

your
iniquities

you

abused
the
royal
power

which
you
have
almost
usurped

held
in
horror
by
God

God
will
punish
you
hereafter

I
will
*NL*
punish
you
here
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
this
is
too
much
!
''
cried
Buckingham
,
making
a
step
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
barred
his
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
it
humbly
of
you
,
my
Lord

said
he
;
``
sign
the

dishonored

*NL*
*NL*
``
Withdraw

Buckingham

``

I

call

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Felton
,
throwing
himself
between
the
duke
and
*NL*
the
bell
placed
on
a
stand
encrusted
with
silver
.
``
Beware
,
my
Lord

you

are
in
the
hands
of
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
hands

''
cried
Buckingham
,
raising
his
*NL*
voice
so
as
to
attract
the
notice
of
his
people
,
without
absolutely
*NL*
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sign
,
my
Lord
;
sign
the
liberation
of
Milady
de
Winter

said
Felton
,
*NL*
holding
out
a
paper
to
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
force
?
You
are
joking
!
Holloa
,
Patrick

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sign

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help

''
shouted
the
duke
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
sprang
toward
his
*NL*
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Felton
did
not
give
him
time
to
draw
it
.
He
held
the
knife
with
*NL*
which
Milady
had
stabbed
herself
,
open
in
his
bosom
;
at
one
bound
he
was
*NL*
upon
the
duke
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Patrick
entered
the
room
,
crying
,
``
A
letter
from
France
,
*NL*
my
Lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
France
!
''
cried
Buckingham
,
forgetting
everything
in
thinking
from
*NL*
whom
that
letter
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
took
advantage
of
this
moment
,
and
plunged
the
knife
into
his
*NL*
side
up
to
the
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
traitor
,
''
cried
Buckingham
,
``
you
have
killed
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Murder
!
''
screamed
Patrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
cast
his
eyes
round
for
means
of
escape
,
and
seeing
the
door
*NL*
free
,
he
rushed
into
the
next
chamber
,
in
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
the
*NL*
deputies
from
La
Rochelle
were
waiting
,
crossed
it
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
rushed
toward
the
staircase
;
but
upon
the
first
step
he
*NL*
met
Lord
de
Winter
,
who
,
seeing
him
pale
,
confused
,
livid
,
and
stained
*NL*
with
blood
both
on
his
hands
and
face
,
seized
him
by
the
throat
,
crying
,
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
!
I
guessed
it
!
But
too
late
by
a
minute
,
unfortunate
,
*NL*
unfortunate
that
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
made
no
resistance
.
Lord
de
Winter
placed
him
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
guards
,
who
led
him
,
while
awaiting
further
orders
,
to
a
little
terrace
*NL*
commanding
the
sea
;
and
then
the
baron
hastened
to
the
duke
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
cry
uttered
by
the
duke
and
the
scream
of
Patrick
,
the
man
whom
*NL*
Felton
had
met
in
the
antechamber
rushed
into
the
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
duke
reclining
upon
a
sofa
,
with
his
hand
pressed
upon
the
*NL*
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laporte
,
''
said
the
duke
,
in
a
dying
voice
,
``
Laporte
,
do
you
come
from
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur

''
replied
the
faithful
cloak
bearer
of
Anne
of
*NL*
Austria
,
``
but
too
late
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
Laporte
,
you
may
be
overheard

Patrick

let
no
one
enter

Oh
,
*NL*
I
can
not
tell
what
she
says
to
me
!
My
God
,
I
am
dying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
duke
swooned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Lord
de
Winter
,
the
deputies
,
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
,
*NL*
the
officers
of
Buckingham
's
household
,
had
all
made
their
way
into
the
*NL*
chamber
.
Cries
of
despair
resounded
on
all
sides
.
The
news
,
which
filled
*NL*
the
palace
with
tears
and
groans
,
soon
became
known
,
and
spread
itself
*NL*
throughout
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
report
of
a
cannon
announced
that
something
new
and
unexpected
had
*NL*
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
tore
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
late
by
a
minute
!
''
cried
he
,
``
too
late
by
a
minute
!
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
*NL*
God
!
what
a
misfortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
informed
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
that
a
rope
ladder
*NL*
floated
from
one
of
the
windows
of
the
castle
;
he
had
hastened
to
*NL*
Milady
's
chamber
,
had
found
it
empty
,
the
window
open
,
and
the
bars
*NL*
filed
,
had
remembered
the
verbal
caution
d'Artagnan
had
transmitted
to
*NL*
him
by
his
messenger
,
had
trembled
for
the
duke
,
and
running
to
the
*NL*
stable
without
taking
time
to
have
a
horse
saddled
,
had
jumped
upon
the
*NL*
first
he
found
,
had
galloped
off
like
the
wind
,
had
alighted
below
in
*NL*
the
courtyard
,
had
ascended
the
stairs
precipitately
,
and
on
the
top
*NL*
step
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
encountered
Felton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
duke
,
however
,
was
not
dead
.
He
recovered
a
little
,
reopened
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
hope
revived
in
all
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
leave
me
alone
with
Patrick
and
Laporte
--
ah
,
is
*NL*
that
you
,
de
Winter

You
sent
me
a
strange
madman
this
morning
!
See
the
*NL*
state
in
which
he
has
put
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
Lord
!

cried
the
baron
,
``
I
shall
never
console
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
be
quite
wrong
,
my
dear
de
Winter

said
Buckingham
,
*NL*
holding
out
his
hand
to
him
.
``
I
do
not
know
the
man

deserves
being
*NL*
regretted
during
the
whole
life

another
man

leave
us
,
I
pray
*NL*
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
went
out
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
only
remained
in
the
closet
of
the
wounded
duke
Laporte
and
*NL*
Patrick
.
A
physician
was
sought
for
,

none
was

found

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
live

my
Lord

you
will
live

''
repeated
the
faithful
servant
*NL*
of
Anne
of
Austria
,
on
his
knees
before
the
duke
's
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
she
written
to
me
?
''
said
Buckingham
,
feebly
,
streaming
with
*NL*
blood
,
and
suppressing
his
agony
to
speak
of
her
he
loved
,
``
what
has
she
*NL*
written
to
me
?
Read
me
her
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

my
Lord

said
Laporte

*NL*
*NL*
``
Obey

Laporte

do
you
not
see
I
have
no
time
to
lose

*NL*
*NL*
Laporte
broke
the
seal
,
and
placed
the
paper
before
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
duke
;
but
Buckingham
in
vain
tried
to
make
out
the
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
!
''
said
he
,
``
read
!
I
can
not
see

Read
,
then
!
For
soon
,
perhaps
,
I
*NL*
shall
not
hear
,
and
I
shall
die
without
knowing
what
she
has
written
to
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Laporte
made
no
further
objection
,
and
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

By
that
which
,
since
I

I
conjure
you
,
if
you
have
any
care
for
my
repose

to
*NL*
countermand
those
great
armaments
which
you
are
preparing
against

France
,
to
put
an
end
to
a
war
of
which
it
is

*NL*
the
ostensible
cause

and
of
which
,
it
is
generally
whispered

your
love

for
me
is
the
concealed
cause

This
war
may
not
only
bring
great
*NL*
catastrophes
upon
England
and
France
,
but
misfortune
upon
you

*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
collected
all
his
remaining
strength
to
listen
to
the
reading
*NL*
of
the
letter
;
then
,
when
it
was
ended
,
as
if
he
had
met
with
a
bitter
*NL*
disappointment
,
he
asked
,
``
Have
you
nothing
else
to
say

me
by
the
*NL*
living
voice
,
Laporte
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is

Buckingham

impatiently

said
Buckingham
,
``
God
be

My

will
not
be

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Laporte
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patrick

''
said
the
duke
,
``
bring
me
the
casket
in
which
the
diamond
*NL*

were
kept

''
*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
brought
the
object
desired
,
which
Laporte
recognized
as
having
*NL*
belonged
to
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

white
satin

*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
again
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

Laporte
,
''
said
Buckingham
,
``
these
are
the
only

I
ever

this

*NL*
restore
them

as
a

''
--
he
looked
round
*NL*
for
some
valuable
object
--
``
you
will
add
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
sought
;
but
his
eyes
,
darkened
by
death
,
encountered
only
the
*NL*
knife
which
had
fallen
from
the
hand
of
Felton
,
still
smoking
with
the
*NL*
blood
spread
over
its
blade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
add
to
them
this
knife
,
''
said
the
duke
,
pressing
the
hand
*NL*
of
Laporte
.
He
had
just
strength
enough
to
place
the
scent
bag
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
silver
casket
,
and
to
let
the
knife
fall
into
it
,
making
a
*NL*
sign
to
Laporte
that
he
was
no
longer
able
to
speak
;
then
,
in
a
last
*NL*
convulsion
,
which
this
time
he
had
not
the
power
to
combat
,
he
slipped
*NL*
from
the
sofa
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Patrick
uttered
a
loud
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buckingham
tried
to
smile
a
last
time
;
but
death
checked
his
thought
,
*NL*
which
remained
engraved
on
his
brow
like
a
last
kiss
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
duke
's
surgeon
arrived
,
quite
terrified
;
he
was
*NL*
already
on
board
the
admiral
's
ship
,
where
they
had
been
obliged
to
seek
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
duke
,
took
his
hand
,
held
it
for
an
instant
in
his
*NL*
own
,
and
letting
it
fall
,
``
All
is
useless
,
''
said
he
,
``
he
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead
,
dead
!
''
cried
Patrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
cry
all
the
crowd
re-entered
the
apartment
,
and
throughout
the
*NL*
palace
and
town
there
was
nothing
but
consternation
and
tumult
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Lord
de
Winter
saw
Buckingham
was
dead
,
he
ran
to
Felton
,
*NL*
whom
the
soldiers
still
guarded
on
the
terrace
of
the
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretch
!
''
said
he
to
the
young
man
,
who
since
the
death
of
Buckingham
*NL*
had
regained
that
coolness
and
self-possession
which
never
after
*NL*
abandoned
him
,
``
wretch
!
what
have
you
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
avenged
myself
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Avenged
yourself
,
''
said
the
baron
.
``
Rather
say
that
you
have
served
as
*NL*
an
instrument
to
that
accursed
woman
;
but
I
swear
to
you
that
this
crime
*NL*
shall
be
her
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
''
replied
Felton
,
quietly
,
``
and
I
am
*NL*
ignorant
of
whom
you
are
speaking
,
my
Lord
.
I
killed
the
Duke
of
*NL*
Buckingham
because
he
twice
refused
you
yourself
to
appoint
me
captain
;
*NL*
I
have
punished
him
for
his
injustice
,
that
is
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
De
Winter
,
stupefied
,
looked
on
while
the
soldiers
bound
Felton
,
and
*NL*
could
not
tell
what
to
think
of
such
insensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
alone
,
however
,
threw
a
shade
over
the
pallid
brow
of
Felton
.
*NL*
At
every
noise
he
heard
,
the
simple
Puritan
fancied
he
recognized
the
*NL*
step
and
voice
of
Milady
coming
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
,
to
*NL*
accuse
herself
,
and
die
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
started
.
His
eyes
became
fixed
upon
a
point
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
commanded
by
the
terrace
where
he
was
.
With
the
eagle
glance
of
a
sailor
*NL*
he
had
recognized
there
,
where
another
would
have
seen
only
a
gull
*NL*
hovering
over
the
waves
,
the
sail
of
a
sloop
which
was
directed
toward
*NL*
the
coast
of
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
deadly
pale
,
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
which
was
breaking
,
*NL*
and
at
once
perceived
all
the
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
last
favor
,
my
Lord
!
''
said
he
to
the
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
his
Lordship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
o'clock
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
drew
out
his
watch
.
``
It
wants
ten
minutes
to
nine
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
had
hastened
her
departure
by
an
hour
and
a
half
.
As
soon
as
she
*NL*
heard
the
cannon
which
announced
the
fatal
event
,
she
had
ordered
the
*NL*
anchor
to
be
weighed
.
The
vessel
was
making
way
under
a
blue
sky
,
at
*NL*
great
distance
from
the
coast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
has
so
willed
it
!
''
said
he
,
with
the
resignation
of
a
fanatic
;
but
*NL*
without
,
however
,
being
able
to
take
his
eyes
from
that
ship
,
on
board
*NL*
of
which
he
doubtless
fancied
he
could
distinguish
the
white
outline
of
*NL*
her
to
whom
he
had
sacrificed
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
De
Winter
followed
his
look
,
observed
his
feelings
,
and
guessed
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
punished
ALONE
,
for
the
first
,
miserable
man
!
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
*NL*
to
Felton
,
who
was
being
dragged
away
with
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
*NL*
sea
;
``
but
I
swear
to
you
by
the
memory
of
my
brother
whom
I
have
loved
*NL*
so
much
that
your
accomplice
is
not
saved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Felton
lowered
his
head
without
pronouncing
a
syllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Lord
de
Winter
,
he
descended
the
stairs
rapidly
,
and
went
straight
*NL*
to
the
port
.

60
IN
FRANCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
fear
of
the
King
of
England
,
Charles
I
,
on
learning
of
the
*NL*
death
of
the
duke
,
was
that
such
terrible
news
might
discourage
the
*NL*
Rochellais
;
he
tried
,
says
Richelieu
in
his
Memoirs
,
to
conceal
it
from
*NL*
them
as
long
as
possible
,
closing
all
the
ports
of
his
kingdom
,
and
*NL*
carefully
keeping
watch
that
no
vessel
should
sail
until
the
army
which
*NL*
Buckingham
was
getting
together
had
gone
,
taking
upon
himself
,
in
*NL*
default
of
Buckingham
,
to
superintend
the
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
carried
the
strictness
of
this
order
so
far
as
to
detain
in
England
*NL*
the
ambassadors
of
Denmark
,
who
had
taken
their
leave
,
and
the
regular
*NL*
ambassador
of
Holland
,
who
was
to
take
back
to
the
port
of
Flushing
the
*NL*
Indian
merchantmen
of
which
Charles
I
had
made
restitution
to
the
United
*NL*
Provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
did
not
think
of
giving
this
order
till
five
hours
after
the
*NL*
event
--
that
is
to
say
,
till
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
--
two
vessels
*NL*
had
already
left
the
port
,
the
one
bearing
,
as
we
know
,
Milady
,
who
,
*NL*
already
anticipating
the
event
,
was
further
confirmed
in
that
belief
by
*NL*
seeing
the
black
flag
flying
at
the
masthead
of
the
admiral
's
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
second
vessel
,
we
will
tell
hereafter
whom
it
carried
,
and
how
*NL*
it
set
sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
time
nothing
new
occurred
in
the
camp
at
La
Rochelle
;
only
*NL*
the
king
,
who
was
bored
,
as
always
,
but
perhaps
a
little
more
so
in
camp
*NL*
than
elsewhere
,
resolved
to
go
incognito
and
spend
the
festival
of
St.
*NL*
Louis
at
St.
Germain
,
and
asked
the
cardinal
to
order
him
an
escort
of
*NL*
only
twenty
Musketeers
.
The
cardinal
,
who
sometimes
became
weary
of
the
*NL*
king
,
granted
this
leave
of
absence
with
great
pleasure
to
his
royal
*NL*
lieutenant
,
who
promised
to
return
about
the
fifteenth
of
September
.
*NL*
*NL*
M
de
Treville
,
being
informed
of
this
by
his
Eminence
,
packed
his
*NL*
portmanteau
;
and
as
without
knowing
the
cause
he
knew
the
great
desire
*NL*
and
even
imperative
need
which
his
friends
had
of
returning
to
Paris
,
it
*NL*
goes
without
saying
that
he
fixed
upon
them
to
form
part
of
the
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
young
men
heard
the
news
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
M.
de
*NL*
Treville
,
for
they
were
the
first
to
whom
he
communicated
it
.
It
was
*NL*
then
that
d'Artagnan
appreciated
the
favor
the
cardinal
had
conferred
*NL*
upon
him
in
making
him
at
last
enter
the
Musketeers
--
for
without
that
*NL*
circumstance
he
would
have
been
forced
to
remain
in
the
camp
while
his
*NL*
companions
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
goes
without
saying
that
this
impatience
to
return
toward
Paris
had
*NL*
for
a
cause
the
danger
which
Mme.
Bonacieux
would
run
of
meeting
at
the
*NL*
convent
of
Bethune
with
Milady
,
her
mortal
enemy
.
Aramis
therefore
had
*NL*
written
immediately
to
Marie
Michon
,
the
seamstress
at
Tours
who
had
*NL*
such
fine
acquaintances
,
to
obtain
from
the
queen
authority
for
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
to
leave
the
convent
,
and
to
retire
either
into
Lorraine
or
*NL*
Belgium
.
They
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
answer
.
Eight
or
ten
days
*NL*
afterward
Aramis
received
the
following
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Dear
Cousin
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
authorization
from
my
sister
to
withdraw
our
little
servant
*NL*
from
the
convent
of
Bethune
,
the
air
of
which
you
think
is
bad
for
her
.
*NL*
My
sister
sends
you
this
authorization
with
great
pleasure
,
for
she
is
*NL*
very
partial
to
the
little
girl
,
to
whom
she
intends
to
be
more
*NL*
serviceable
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
salute
you
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
MARIE
MICHON
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
letter
was
added
an
order
,
conceived
in
these
terms
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Louvre
,
August
10
,
1628
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
superior
of
the
convent
of
Bethune
will
place
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
person
who
shall
present
this
note
to
her
the
novice
who
entered
the
*NL*
convent
upon
my
recommendation
and
under
my
patronage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
ANNE
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
easily
imagined
how
the
relationship
between
Aramis
and
a
*NL*
seamstress
who
called
the
queen
her
sister
amused
the
young
men
;
but
*NL*
Aramis
,
after
having
blushed
two
or
three
times
up
to
the
whites
of
his
*NL*
eyes
at
the
gross
pleasantry
of
Porthos
,
begged
his
friends
not
to
*NL*
revert
to
the
subject
again
,
declaring
that
if
a
single
word
more
was
*NL*
said
to
him
about
it
,
he
would
never
again
implore
his
cousins
to
*NL*
interfere
in
such
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
further
question
,
therefore
,
about
Marie
Michon
among
the
*NL*
four
Musketeers
,
who
besides
had
what
they
wanted
:
that
was
,
the
order
*NL*
to
withdraw
Mme.
Bonacieux
from
the
convent
of
the
Carmelites
of
*NL*
Bethune
.
It
was
true
that
this
order
would
not
be
of
great
use
to
them
*NL*
while
they
were
in
camp
at
La
Rochelle
;
that
is
to
say
,
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
France
.
Therefore
d'Artagnan
was
going
to
ask
leave
of
absence
of
M.
*NL*
de
Treville
,
confiding
to
him
candidly
the
importance
of
his
departure
,
*NL*
when
the
news
was
transmitted
to
him
as
well
as
to
his
three
friends
*NL*
that
the
king
was
about
to
set
out
for
Paris
with
an
escort
of
twenty
*NL*
Musketeers
,
and
that
they
formed
part
of
the
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
joy
was
great
.
The
lackeys
were
sent
on
before
with
the
baggage
,
*NL*
and
they
set
out
on
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
accompanied
his
Majesty
from
Surgeres
to
Mauzes
;
and
there
*NL*
the
king
and
his
minister
took
leave
of
each
other
with
great
*NL*
demonstrations
of
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
,
however
,
who
sought
distraction
,
while
traveling
as
fast
as
*NL*
possible
--
for
he
was
anxious
to
be
in
Paris
by
the
twenty-third
--
stopped
*NL*
from
time
to
time
to
fly
the
magpie
,
a
pastime
for
which
the
taste
had
*NL*
been
formerly
inspired
in
him
by
de
Luynes
,
and
for
which
he
had
always
*NL*
preserved
a
great
predilection
.
Out
of
the
twenty
Musketeers
sixteen
,
*NL*
when
this
took
place
,
rejoiced
greatly
at
this
relaxation
;
but
the
other
*NL*
four
cursed
it
heartily
.
D'Artagnan
,
in
particular
,
had
a
perpetual
*NL*
buzzing
in
his
ears
,
which
Porthos
explained
thus
:
``
A
very
great
lady
*NL*
has
told
me
that
this
means
that
somebody
is
talking
of
you
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
escort
passed
through
Paris
on
the
twenty-third
,
in
the
*NL*
night
.
The
king
thanked
M.
de
Treville
,
and
permitted
him
to
distribute
*NL*
furloughs
for
four
days
,
on
condition
that
the
favored
parties
should
*NL*
not
appear
in
any
public
place
,
under
penalty
of
the
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
four
furloughs
granted
,
as
may
be
imagined
,
were
to
our
four
*NL*
friends
.
Still
further
,
Athos
obtained
of
M.
de
Treville
six
days
*NL*
instead
of
four
,
and
introduced
into
these
six
days
two
more
nights
--
for
*NL*
they
set
out
on
the
twenty-fourth
at
five
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
as
*NL*
a
further
kindness
M.
de
Treville
post-dated
the
leave
to
the
morning
of
*NL*
the
twenty-fifth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
as
we
have
often
said
,
never
stumbled
*NL*
at
anything
.
``
It
appears
to
me
that
we
are
making
a
great
trouble
of
a
*NL*
very
simple
thing
.
In
two
days
,
and
by
using
up
two
or
three
horses
*NL*
-LRB-
that
's
nothing
;
I
have
plenty
of
money
-RRB-
,
I
am
at
Bethune
.
I
present
my
*NL*
letter
from
the
queen
to
the
superior
,
and
I
bring
back
the
dear
*NL*
treasure
I
go
to
seek
--
not
into
Lorraine
,
not
into
Belgium
,
but
to
*NL*
Paris
,
where
she
will
be
much
better
concealed
,
particularly
while
the
*NL*
cardinal
is
at
La
Rochelle
.
Well
,
once
returned
from
the
country
,
half
*NL*
by
the
protection
of
her
cousin
,
half
through
what
we
have
personally
*NL*
done
for
her
,
we
shall
obtain
from
the
queen
what
we
desire
.
Remain
,
*NL*
then
,
where
you
are
,
and
do
not
exhaust
yourselves
with
useless
fatigue
.
*NL*
Myself
and
Planchet
are
all
that
such
a
simple
expedition
requires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Athos
replied
quietly
:
``
We
also
have
money
left
--
for
I
have
not
*NL*
yet
drunk
all
my
share
of
the
diamond
,
and
Porthos
and
Aramis
have
not
*NL*
eaten
all
theirs
.
We
can
therefore
use
up
four
horses
as
well
as
one
.
*NL*
But
consider
,
d'Artagnan
,
''
added
he
,
in
a
tone
so
solemn
that
it
made
*NL*
the
young
man
shudder
,
``
consider
that
Bethune
is
a
city
where
the
*NL*
cardinal
has
given
rendezvous
to
a
woman
who
,
wherever
she
goes
,
brings
*NL*
misery
with
her
.
If
you
had
only
to
deal
with
four
men
,
d'Artagnan
,
I
*NL*
would
allow
you
to
go
alone
.
You
have
to
do
with
that
woman
!
We
four
*NL*
will
go
;
and
I
hope
to
God
that
with
our
four
lackeys
we
may
be
in
*NL*
sufficient
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
terrify
me
,
Athos
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
My
God
!
what
do
you
fear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
!
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
examined
the
countenances
of
his
companions
,
which
,
like
that
*NL*
of
Athos
,
wore
an
impression
of
deep
anxiety
;
and
they
continued
their
*NL*
route
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
,
but
without
adding
*NL*
another
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
twenty-fifth
,
as
they
were
entering
Arras
,
and
as
*NL*
d'Artagnan
was
dismounting
at
the
inn
of
the
Golden
Harrow
to
drink
a
*NL*
glass
of
wine
,
a
horseman
came
out
of
the
post
yard
,
where
he
had
just
*NL*
had
a
relay
,
started
off
at
a
gallop
,
and
with
a
fresh
horse
took
the
*NL*
road
to
Paris
.
At
the
moment
he
passed
through
the
gateway
into
the
*NL*
street
,
the
wind
blew
open
the
cloak
in
which
he
was
wrapped
,
although
*NL*
it
was
in
the
month
of
August
,
and
lifted
his
hat
,
which
the
traveler
*NL*
seized
with
his
hand
the
moment
it
had
left
his
head
,
pulling
it
eagerly
*NL*
over
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
who
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
this
man
,
became
very
pale
,
and
*NL*
let
his
glass
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
,
monsieur
?
''
said
Planchet
.
``
Oh
,
come
,
gentlemen
,
my
*NL*
master
is
ill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
friends
hastened
toward
d'Artagnan
,
who
,
instead
of
being
ill
,
*NL*
ran
toward
his
horse
.
They
stopped
him
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
the
devil
are
you
going
now
?
''
cried
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
pale
with
anger
,
and
with
the
sweat
on
his
*NL*
brow
,
``
it
is
he
!
let
me
overtake
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
What
he
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
,
that
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
cursed
man

my
evil
genius

I
have
always
met

he
who
accompanied
that
horrible
woman

I
met
her
for
the
first
time

he

I
was
seeking

I
offended

Athos

I
saw
on
the
very
morning
Madame
Bonacieux
was
*NL*
abducted
.
I
have
seen
him
;
that
is
he

I
recognized
him
when
the
wind
*NL*
blew
upon
his
cloak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil

said
Athos
,
musingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
saddle

Let

pursue
him

and
we
shall

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
Aramis
,
``
remember
that
he
goes
in
an
opposite

direction
from
that
in
which
we
are
going

that
he
has
a
fresh
horse
,
*NL*
and
ours
are
fatigued
,
so
that
we
shall
disable
our
own
horses
without
*NL*
even
a
chance
of
overtaking
him
.
Let
the
man
go
,
d'Artagnan
;
let
us
save
*NL*
the
woman

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
monsieur
!
''
cried
a
hostler
,
running
out
and
looking
after
the
*NL*
stranger
,
``
monsieur
,
here
is
a
paper
which
dropped
out
of
your
hat
!
Eh

*NL*
monsieur
,
eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend

''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
a
half-pistole
for
that
paper

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faith
,
monsieur
,
with
great
pleasure
!
Here
it
is
!

*NL*
*NL*
The
hostler
,
enchanted
with
the
good
day
's
work
he
had
done
,
returned
to
*NL*
the
yard
.
D'Artagnan
unfolded
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
eagerly
demanded
all
his
three
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
one
word
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Aramis
,
``
but
that
one
word
is
the
name
of
some
town

*NL*
village

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Armentieres

''
read
Porthos
;
``
Armentieres
?
I
do
n't
know
such
a
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
name

cried
*NL*
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on

come
on

said
d'Artagnan
;
``
let

keep

flew
at

THE
CARMELITE
CONVENT
AT
BETHUNE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Great
criminals
bear
about
them
a
kind
of
predestination
which
makes
*NL*
them
surmount
all
obstacles
,
which
makes
them
escape
all
dangers
,
up
to
*NL*
the
moment
which
a
wearied
Providence
has
marked
as
the
rock
of
their
*NL*
impious
fortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
with
Milady
.
She
escaped
the
cruisers
of
both
nations
,
and
*NL*
arrived
at
Boulogne
without
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
landing
at
Portsmouth
,
Milady
was
an
Englishwoman
whom
the
*NL*
persecutions
of
the
French
drove
from
La
Rochelle
;
when
landing
at
*NL*
Boulogne
,
after
a
two
days
'
passage
,
she
passed
for
a
Frenchwoman
whom
*NL*
the
English
persecuted
at
Portsmouth
out
of
their
hatred
for
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
had
,
likewise
,
the
best
of
passports
--
her
beauty
,
her
noble
*NL*
appearance
,
and
the
liberality
with
which
she
distributed
her
pistoles
.
*NL*
Freed
from
the
usual
formalities
by
the
affable
smile
and
gallant
*NL*
manners
of
an
old
governor
of
the
port
,
who
kissed
her
hand
,
she
only
*NL*
remained
long
enough
at
Boulogne
to
put
into
the
post
a
letter
,
*NL*
conceived
in
the
following
terms
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
his
Eminence
Monseigneur
the
Cardinal
Richelieu
,
in
his
camp
before
*NL*
La
Rochelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
*NL*
*NL*
Let
your
Eminence
be
reassured
.
His
Grace
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
WILL
*NL*
NOT
SET
OUT
for
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MILADY
DE
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
BOULOGNE
,
evening
of
the
twenty-fifth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P.S.
--
According
to
the
desire
of
your
Eminence
,
I
report
to
the
convent
*NL*
of
the
Carmelites
at
Bethune
,
where
I
will
await
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
that
same
evening
Milady
commenced
her
journey
.
Night
*NL*
overtook
her
;
she
stopped
,
and
slept
at
an
inn
.
At
five
o'clock
the
next
*NL*
morning
she
again
proceeded
,
and
in
three
hours
after
entered
Bethune
.
*NL*
She
inquired
for
the
convent
of
the
Carmelites
,
and
went
thither
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
superior
met
her
;
Milady
showed
her
the
cardinal
's
order
.
The
abbess
*NL*
assigned
her
a
chamber
,
and
had
breakfast
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
past
was
effaced
from
the
eyes
of
this
woman
;
and
her
looks
,
*NL*
fixed
on
the
future
,
beheld
nothing
but
the
high
fortunes
reserved
for
*NL*
her
by
the
cardinal
,
whom
she
had
so
successfully
served
without
his
*NL*
name
being
in
any
way
mixed
up
with
the
sanguinary
affair
.
The
ever-new
*NL*
passions
which
consumed
her
gave
to
her
life
the
appearance
of
those
*NL*
clouds
which
float
in
the
heavens
,
reflecting
sometimes
azure
,
sometimes
*NL*
fire
,
sometimes
the
opaque
blackness
of
the
tempest
,
and
which
leave
no
*NL*
traces
upon
the
earth
behind
them
but
devastation
and
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
the
abbess
came
to
pay
her
a
visit
.
There
is
very
*NL*
little
amusement
in
the
cloister
,
and
the
good
superior
was
eager
to
*NL*
make
the
acquaintance
of
her
new
boarder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
wished
to
please
the
abbess
.
This
was
a
very
easy
matter
for
a
*NL*
woman
so
really
superior
as
she
was
.
She
tried
to
be
agreeable
,
and
she
*NL*
was
charming
,
winning
the
good
superior
by
her
varied
conversation
and
*NL*
by
the
graces
of
her
whole
personality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
,
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
noble
house
,
took
particular
*NL*
delight
in
stories
of
the
court
,
which
so
seldom
travel
to
the
*NL*
extremities
of
the
kingdom
,
and
which
,
above
all
,
have
so
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
penetrating
the
walls
of
convents
,
at
whose
threshold
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
world
dies
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
quite
conversant
with
all
aristocratic
*NL*
intrigues
,
amid
which
she
had
constantly
lived
for
five
or
six
years
.
*NL*
She
made
it
her
business
,
therefore
,
to
amuse
the
good
abbess
with
the
*NL*
worldly
practices
of
the
court
of
France
,
mixed
with
the
eccentric
*NL*
pursuits
of
the
king
;
she
made
for
her
the
scandalous
chronicle
of
the
*NL*
lords
and
ladies
of
the
court
,
whom
the
abbess
knew
perfectly
by
name
,
*NL*
touched
lightly
on
the
amours
of
the
queen
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
*NL*
talking
a
great
deal
to
induce
her
auditor
to
talk
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
abbess
contented
herself
with
listening
and
smiling
without
*NL*
replying
a
word
.
Milady
,
however
,
saw
that
this
sort
of
narrative
amused
*NL*
her
very
much
,
and
kept
at
it
;
only
she
now
let
her
conversation
drift
*NL*
toward
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
greatly
embarrassed
.
She
did
not
know
whether
the
abbess
was
*NL*
a
royalist
or
a
cardinalist
;
she
therefore
confined
herself
to
a
prudent
*NL*
middle
course
.
But
the
abbess
,
on
her
part
,
maintained
a
reserve
still
*NL*
more
prudent
,
contenting
herself
with
making
a
profound
inclination
of
*NL*
the
head
every
time
the
fair
traveler
pronounced
the
name
of
his
*NL*
Eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
began
to
think
she
should
soon
grow
weary
of
a
convent
life
;
she
*NL*
resolved
,
then
,
to
risk
something
in
order
that
she
might
know
how
to
*NL*
act
afterward
.
Desirous
of
seeing
how
far
the
discretion
of
the
good
*NL*
abbess
would
go
,
she
began
to
tell
a
story
,
obscure
at
first
,
but
very
*NL*
circumstantial
afterward
,
about
the
cardinal
,
relating
the
amours
of
the
*NL*
minister
with
Mme.
d'Aiguillon
,
Marion
de
Lorme
,
and
several
other
gay
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
listened
more
attentively
,
grew
animated
by
degrees
,
and
*NL*
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
thought
Milady
;
``
she
takes
a
pleasure
in
my
conversation
.
If
she
*NL*
is
a
cardinalist
,
she
has
no
fanaticism
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
went
on
to
describe
the
persecutions
exercised
by
the
cardinal
*NL*
upon
his
enemies
.
The
abbess
only
crossed
herself
,
without
approving
or
*NL*
disapproving
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confirmed
Milady
in
her
opinion
that
the
abbess
was
rather
royalist
*NL*
than
cardinalist
.
Milady
therefore
continued
,
coloring
her
narrations
*NL*
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
ignorant
of
these
matters
,
''
said
the
abbess
,
at
length
;
``
but
*NL*
however
distant
from
the
court
we
may
be
,
however
remote
from
the
*NL*
interests
of
the
world
we
may
be
placed
,
we
have
very
sad
examples
of
*NL*
what
you
have
related
.
And
one
of
our
boarders
has
suffered
much
from
*NL*
the
vengeance
and
persecution
of
the
cardinal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
your
boarders
?
''
said
Milady
;
``
oh
,
my
God
!
Poor
woman
!
I
pity
*NL*
her
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
reason
,
for
she
is
much
to
be
pitied
.
Imprisonment
,
*NL*
menaces
,
ill
treatment-she
has
suffered
everything
.
But
after
all
,
''
*NL*
resumed
the
abbess
,
``
Monsieur
Cardinal
has
perhaps
plausible
motives
for
*NL*
acting
thus
;
and
though
she
has
the
look
of
an
angel
,
we
must
not
always
*NL*
judge
people
by
the
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Milady
to
herself
;
``
who
knows
!
I
am
about
,
perhaps
,
to
*NL*
discover
something
here
;
I
am
in
the
vein
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
give
her
countenance
an
appearance
of
perfect
candor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
I
know
it
is
so
.
It
is
said
that
we
must
not
trust
*NL*
to
the
face
;
but
in
what
,
then
,
shall
we
place
confidence
,
if
not
in
the
*NL*
most
beautiful
work
of
the
Lord
?
As
for
me
,
I
shall
be
deceived
all
my
*NL*
life
perhaps
,
but
I
shall
always
have
faith
in
a
person
whose
*NL*
countenance
inspires
me
with
sympathy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
,
then
,
be
tempted
to
believe
,
''
said
the
abbess
,
``
that
this
*NL*
young
person
is
innocent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cardinal
pursues
not
only
crimes
,
''
said
she
:
``
there
are
certain
*NL*
virtues
which
he
pursues
more
severely
than
certain
offenses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permit
me
,
madame
,
to
express
my
surprise
,
''
said
the
abbess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
?
''
said
Milady
,
with
the
utmost
ingenuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
language
you
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
find
so
astonishing
in
that
language
?
''
said
Milady
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
friend
of
the
cardinal
,
for
he
sends
you
hither
,
and
yet
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
I
speak
ill
of
him
,
''
replied
Milady
,
finishing
the
thought
of
*NL*
the
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
you
do
n't
speak
well
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
because
I
am
not
his
friend
,
''
said
she
,
sighing
,
``
but
his
*NL*
victim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
letter
in
which
he
recommends
you
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
an
order
for
me
to
confine
myself
to
a
sort
of
prison
,
from
which
he
*NL*
will
release
me
by
one
of
his
satellites
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
have
you
not
fled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
should
I
go
?
Do
you
believe
there
is
a
spot
on
the
earth
which
*NL*
the
cardinal
can
not
reach
if
he
takes
the
trouble
to
stretch
forth
his
*NL*
hand
?
If
I
were
a
man
,
that
would
barely
be
possible
;
but
what
can
a
*NL*
woman
do
?
This
young
boarder
of
yours
,
has
she
tried
to
fly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
is
true
;
but
she
--
that
is
another
thing
;
I
believe
she
is
*NL*
detained
in
France
by
some
love
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Milady
,
with
a
sigh
,
``
if
she
loves
she
is
not
altogether
*NL*
wretched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
the
abbess
,
looking
at
Milady
with
increasing
interest
,
``
I
*NL*
behold
another
poor
victim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
yes
,
''
said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
looked
at
her
for
an
instant
with
uneasiness
,
as
if
a
fresh
*NL*
thought
suggested
itself
to
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
an
enemy
of
our
holy
faith
?
''
said
she
,
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
--
I
?
''
cried
Milady
;
``
I
a
Protestant
?
Oh
,
no
!
I
call
to
witness
the
*NL*
God
who
hears
us
,
that
on
the
contrary
I
am
a
fervent
Catholic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
madame
,
''
said
the
abbess
,
smiling
,
``
be
reassured
;
the
house
in
*NL*
which
you
are
shall
not
be
a
very
hard
prison
,
and
we
will
do
all
in
our
*NL*
power
to
make
you
cherish
your
captivity
.
You
will
find
here
,
moreover
,
*NL*
the
young
woman
of
whom
I
spoke
,
who
is
persecuted
,
no
doubt
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
some
court
intrigue
.
She
is
amiable
and
well-behaved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
sent
to
me
by
someone
of
high
rank
,
under
the
name
of
Kitty
.
I
*NL*
have
not
tried
to
discover
her
other
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
!
''
cried
Milady
.
``
What
?
Are
you
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
is
called
so
?
Yes
,
madame
.
Do
you
know
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
smiled
to
herself
at
the
idea
which
had
occurred
to
her
that
this
*NL*
might
be
her
old
chambermaid
.
There
was
connected
with
the
remembrance
*NL*
of
this
girl
a
remembrance
of
anger
;
and
a
desire
of
vengeance
*NL*
disordered
the
features
of
Milady
,
which
,
however
,
immediately
recovered
*NL*
the
calm
and
benevolent
expression
which
this
woman
of
a
hundred
faces
*NL*
had
for
a
moment
allowed
them
to
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
can
I
see
this
young
lady
,
for
whom
I
already
feel
so
great
a
*NL*
sympathy
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
evening
,
''
said
the
abbess
;
``
today
even
.
But
you
have
been
*NL*
traveling
these
four
days
,
as
you
told
me
yourself
.
This
morning
you
*NL*
rose
at
five
o'clock
;
you
must
stand
in
need
of
repose
.
Go
to
bed
and
*NL*
sleep
;
at
dinnertime
we
will
rouse
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Milady
would
very
willingly
have
gone
without
sleep
,
sustained
*NL*
as
she
was
by
all
the
excitements
which
a
new
adventure
awakened
in
her
*NL*
heart
,
ever
thirsting
for
intrigues
,
she
nevertheless
accepted
the
offer
*NL*
of
the
superior
.
During
the
last
fifteen
days
she
had
experienced
so
*NL*
many
and
such
various
emotions
that
if
her
frame
of
iron
was
still
*NL*
capable
of
supporting
fatigue
,
her
mind
required
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
therefore
took
leave
of
the
abbess
,
and
went
to
bed
,
softly
rocked
*NL*
by
the
ideas
of
vengeance
which
the
name
of
Kitty
had
naturally
brought
*NL*
to
her
thoughts
.
She
remembered
that
almost
unlimited
promise
which
the
*NL*
cardinal
had
given
her
if
she
succeeded
in
her
enterprise
.
She
had
*NL*
succeeded
;
d'Artagnan
was
then
in
her
power
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
alone
frightened
her
;
that
was
the
remembrance
of
her
husband
,
*NL*
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
,
whom
she
had
believed
dead
,
or
at
least
*NL*
expatriated
,
and
whom
she
found
again
in
Athos-the
best
friend
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
alas
,
if
he
was
the
friend
of
d'Artagnan
,
he
must
have
lent
him
his
*NL*
assistance
in
all
the
proceedings
by
whose
aid
the
queen
had
defeated
*NL*
the
project
of
his
Eminence
;
if
he
was
the
friend
of
d'Artagnan
,
he
was
*NL*
the
enemy
of
the
cardinal
;
and
she
doubtless
would
succeed
in
involving
*NL*
him
in
the
vengeance
by
which
she
hoped
to
destroy
the
young
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
hopes
were
so
many
sweet
thoughts
for
Milady
;
so
,
rocked
by
*NL*
them
,
she
soon
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
awakened
by
a
soft
voice
which
sounded
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
.
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
,
and
saw
the
abbess
,
accompanied
by
a
young
woman
*NL*
with
light
hair
and
delicate
complexion
,
who
fixed
upon
her
a
look
full
*NL*
of
benevolent
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
the
young
woman
was
entirely
unknown
to
her
.
Each
examined
*NL*
the
other
with
great
attention
,
while
exchanging
the
customary
*NL*
compliments
;
both
were
very
handsome
,
but
of
quite
different
styles
of
*NL*
beauty
.
Milady
,
however
,
smiled
in
observing
that
she
excelled
the
young
*NL*
woman
by
far
in
her
high
air
and
aristocratic
bearing
.
It
is
true
that
*NL*
the
habit
of
a
novice
,
which
the
young
woman
wore
,
was
not
very
*NL*
advantageous
in
a
contest
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
introduced
them
to
each
other
.
When
this
formality
was
ended
,
*NL*
as
her
duties
called
her
to
chapel
,
she
left
the
two
young
women
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
novice
,
seeing
Milady
in
bed
,
was
about
to
follow
the
example
of
the
*NL*
superior
;
but
Milady
stopped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
madame
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
scarcely
seen
you
,
and
you
already
wish
*NL*
to
deprive
me
of
your
company
,
upon
which
I
had
counted
a
little
,
I
must
*NL*
confess
,
for
the
time
I
have
to
pass
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
madame
,
''
replied
the
novice
,
``
only
I
thought
I
had
chosen
my
time
*NL*
ill
;
you
were
asleep
,
you
are
fatigued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Milady
,
``
what
can
those
who
sleep
wish
for
--
a
happy
*NL*
awakening
?
This
awakening
you
have
given
me
;
allow
me
,
then
,
to
enjoy
it
*NL*
at
my
ease
,
''
and
taking
her
hand
,
she
drew
her
toward
the
armchair
by
*NL*
the
bedside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
novice
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
unfortunate
I
am
!
''
said
she
;
``
I
have
been
here
six
months
without
*NL*
the
shadow
of
recreation
.
You
arrive
,
and
your
presence
was
likely
to
*NL*
afford
me
delightful
company
;
yet
I
expect
,
in
all
probability
,
to
quit
*NL*
the
convent
at
any
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
you
are
going
soon
?
''
asked
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
I
hope
so
,
''
said
the
novice
,
with
an
expression
of
joy
which
*NL*
she
made
no
effort
to
disguise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
learned
you
had
suffered
persecutions
from
the
cardinal
,
''
*NL*
continued
Milady
;
``
that
would
have
been
another
motive
for
sympathy
*NL*
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
have
heard
,
then
,
from
our
good
mother
is
true
;
you
have
*NL*
likewise
been
a
victim
of
that
wicked
priest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
Milady
;
``
let
us
not
,
even
here
,
speak
thus
of
him
.
All
my
*NL*
misfortunes
arise
from
my
having
said
nearly
what
you
have
said
before
a
*NL*
woman
whom
I
thought
my
friend
,
and
who
betrayed
me
.
Are
you
also
the
*NL*
victim
of
a
treachery
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
novice
,
``
but
of
my
devotion
--
of
a
devotion
to
a
woman
I
*NL*
loved
,
for
whom
I
would
have
laid
down
my
life
,
for
whom
I
would
give
it
*NL*
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
has
abandoned
you
--
is
that
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
sufficiently
unjust
to
believe
so
;
but
during
the
last
two
*NL*
or
three
days
I
have
obtained
proof
to
the
contrary
,
for
which
I
thank
*NL*
God
--
for
it
would
have
cost
me
very
dear
to
think
she
had
forgotten
me
.
*NL*
But
you
,
madame
,
you
appear
to
be
free
,
''
continued
the
novice
;
``
and
if
*NL*
you
were
inclined
to
fly
it
only
rests
with
yourself
to
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
would
you
have
me
go
,
without
friends
,
without
money
,
in
a
part
*NL*
of
France
with
which
I
am
unacquainted
,
and
where
I
have
never
been

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

cried
the
novice
,
``
as
to
friends

you
would
have
them

good

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
not
prevent

''
replied
Milady
,
softening
her
smile
so
as
to
*NL*
give
it
an
angelic
expression
,
``
my
being
alone
or
being
persecuted

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
me
,
''
said
the
novice
;
``
we
must
trust
in
heaven

There
always
comes
*NL*
a
moment
when
the
good
you
have
done
pleads
your
cause
before
God
;
and
*NL*
see
,
perhaps
it
is
a
happiness
for
you
,
humble
and
powerless
as
I
am
,
*NL*
that
you
have
met
with
me

for
if
I
leave
this

well-I
have
*NL*
powerful
friends

who
,
after
having
exerted
themselves
on
my
account

*NL*
may
also
exert
themselves
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
when
I
said
I
was
alone

said
Milady
,
hoping
to
make
the
novice
*NL*
talk
by
talking
of
herself
,
``
it
is
not
for
want
of
friends
in
high
*NL*
places

but
these
friends
themselves
tremble
before
the
cardinal

The
*NL*
queen
herself
does
not
dare
to
oppose
the
terrible
minister
.
I
have
*NL*
proof
that
her
Majesty
,
notwithstanding
her
excellent
heart

has
more
*NL*
than
once
been
obliged
to
abandon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust

the
queen
may
appear
to
have
abandoned
those
persons

*NL*

we
must
not
put
faith
in
appearances
.
The
more
they
are
persecuted

*NL*
the
more
she
thinks
of
them
;
and
often
,
when
they
least
expect
it

they
*NL*
have
proof
of
a
kind
remembrance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas

said
Milady
,
``
I
believe
so

so
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

cried
the
novice
,
with
enthusiasm

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

replied
Milady

driven
into
her
entrenchment
,
``

*NL*
*NL*

said
Milady
,
who
,
having
entered
this
track
,
and
perceiving
*NL*
that
falsehood
succeeded

was
determined
to
follow
it
to
the
end

*NL*
*NL*
``
With

replied
Milady

for

*NL*
this
conversation
began
to
have
a
real
interest

*NL*
*NL*

The
novice
let
her
speak

then
seeing
that
she
paused
,
she
said
,
``
Do

*NL*

Milady
became
as
pale
as
the
sheets
in
which
she
was
lying

and
mistress
*NL*
as
she
was
of
herself

could
not

uttering

seizing
the

devouring
her
with
looks

*NL*

*NL*
``
No

struck
me

me

chill
penetrate
her
heart

*NL*
``
Well

Milady

I
am
not

cried
the

in
her
turn
seizing
*NL*
the
hands
of
Milady
and
devouring
her
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
remarking
the
strange
expression
of
Milady
's
countenance
,
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Pardon

*NL*

Milady

embarrassed

``
why

*NL*
*NL*

You

in

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

Yes

The
young

drew
back

filled
with
surprise
and
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do
not
deny

Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

madame

said
the

,
``
Are

*NL*
*NL*
The
countenance
of
Milady
was
illumined
by
so
savage
a
joy
that
under
*NL*
any
other
circumstances
Mme.
Bonacieux
would
have
fled
in
terror
;
but
*NL*
she
was
absorbed
by
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
,
madame
!
''
resumed
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
with
an
energy
of
which
she
*NL*
might
not
have
been
believed
capable
.
``
Have
you
been

are
you

his
*NL*
mistress

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

cried
Milady

with
an
accent
that
admitted
no

of
her
*NL*
truth

``
Never

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you

did
you
cry
out

so
?

*NL*

Do

not
understand

said
Milady
,
who
had
already
overcome
her
*NL*
agitation
and
recovered
all
her
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
understand
?
I
know
nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
not

Truly

*NL*
``
Do

your

house
at
St.

his
despair
,
that
of
his
friends

and
their
*NL*
useless
inquiries
up
to
this
moment

How
could
I
help
being
astonished

when
,
without
having
the

expectation
of
such
a
thing

I
meet
you

you

often
spoken
together

you

loves
with
all

soul

taught

to
love
before
I
had

seen

Ah

I
have
found
you

then

I
see
you
at

last

*NL*
*NL*
And
Milady
stretched
out
her
arms
to
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
who
,
convinced
by
*NL*
what
she
had
just
said
,
saw
nothing
in
this
woman
whom
an
instant
before
*NL*
she
had
believed
her
rival
but
a
sincere
and
devoted
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pardon
me

pardon
me
!

cried
she
,
sinking
upon
the
shoulders
of
*NL*
Milady
.
``
Pardon
me
,
I
love
him
so
much
!

*NL*
*NL*
These
two
women
held
each
other
for
an
instant
in
a
close
embrace
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
if
Milady
's
strength
had
been
equal
to
her
hatred
,
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
would
never
have
left
that
embrace
alive
.
But
not
being
able
*NL*
to
stifle
her
,
she
smiled
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
beautiful

good
little
creature

said
Milady
.
``
How
delighted
I
*NL*
am
to
have
found
you

Let
me
look
at
you

and
while
saying
these
words

*NL*
she
absolutely
devoured
her
by
her
looks
.
``
Oh

yes
it
is
you
indeed

*NL*
From
what
he
has
told
me

I
know
you
now

I
recognize
you
perfectly

*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
young
woman
could
not
possibly
suspect
what
frightful
cruelty
*NL*
was
behind
the
rampart
of
that
pure
brow
,
behind
those
brilliant
eyes
in
*NL*
which
she
read
nothing
but
interest
and
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
know
what
I
have
suffered

said
Mme.
Bonacieux

``
since
he
has
*NL*
told
you
what
he
has
suffered

to
suffer
for
him
is
happiness

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
replied
mechanically
,
``
Yes

that
is
happiness

She
was
thinking
*NL*
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then

continued
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
my
punishment
is
drawing

close

Tomorrow

this

I

again

then
*NL*
the
past
will
no

exist

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening

asked
Milady

roused
from
her
reverie
by
these
words

What

Do
you
expect
news

Himself

Oh

I
can
not

*NL*
``
Well

said
the
unhappy
young
woman
,
in
the
excess
of
her
*NL*
pride
and
joy
,
presenting
a
letter
to
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
writing
of
Madame
de
Chevreuse
!
''
said
Milady
to
herself
.
``
Ah
,
I
*NL*
always
thought
there
was
some
secret
understanding
in
that
quarter
!
''
And
*NL*
she
greedily
read
the
following
few
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
My
Dear
Child
,
Hold
yourself
ready
.
OUR
FRIEND
will
see
you
soon
,
and
he
*NL*
will
only
see
you
to
release
you
from
that
imprisonment
in
which
your
*NL*
safety
required
you
should
be
concealed
.
Prepare
,
then
,
for
your
*NL*
departure
,
and
never
despair
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
charming
Gascon
has
just
proved
himself
as
brave
and
faithful
as
*NL*
ever
.
Tell
him
that
certain
parties
are
grateful
for
the
warning
he
has
*NL*
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Milady
;
``
the
letter
is
precise
.
Do
you
know
what
that
*NL*
warning
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
only
suspect
he
has
warned
the
queen
against
some
fresh
*NL*
machinations
of
the
cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
,
no
doubt
!
''
said
Milady
,
returning
the
letter
to
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
,
and
letting
her
head
sink
pensively
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
they
heard
the
gallop
of
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
darting
to
the
window
,
``
can
it
be
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
remained
still
in
bed
,
petrified
by
surprise
;
so
many
unexpected
*NL*
things
happened
to
her
all
at
once
that
for
the
first
time
she
was
at
a
*NL*
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
,
he
!
''
murmured
she
;
``
can
it
be
he
?
''
And
she
remained
in
bed
with
her
*NL*
eyes
fixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
no
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
it
is
a
man
I
do
n't

although
he

seems

be
coming

Yes

he
checks
his
pace

he
stops
at
the
gate
;

he
rings

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
sprang
out
of
bed

You
are

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
did
not

well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
were

see
the
plume

hat

cloak

should
know

Milady
was
dressing
herself
all
the
time

*NL*
``
Yes

has
entered

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
somebody
is
coming

Immediately
the
door
opened
,
and
the
superior
entered

``
Did

come
from

Rochefort

re-entered

with

countenance

Milady
arose

went
to

in

The

raised

waved
his

*NL*
And
the
two
women
parted
,
exchanging
charming
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
had
told
the
truth
--
her
head
was
confused
,
for
her
ill-arranged
*NL*
plans
clashed
one
another
like
chaos
.
She
required
to
be
alone
that
she
*NL*
might
put
her
thoughts
a
little
into
order
.
She
saw
vaguely
the
future
;
*NL*
but
she
stood
in
need
of
a
little
silence
and
quiet
to
give
all
her
*NL*
ideas
,
as
yet
confused
,
a
distinct
form
and
a
regular
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
most
pressing
was
to
get
Mme.
Bonacieux
away
,
and
convey
her
to
*NL*
a
place
of
safety
,
and
there
,
if
matters
required
,
make
her
a
hostage
.
*NL*
Milady
began
to
have
doubts
of
the
issue
of
this
terrible
duel
,
in
which
*NL*
her
enemies
showed
as
much
perseverance
as
she
did
animosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
she
felt
as
we
feel
when
a
storm
is
coming
on
--
that
this
issue
*NL*
was
near
,
and
could
not
fail
to
be
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
principal
thing
for
her
,
then
,
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
to
keep
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
in
her
power
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
the
very
life
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
This
was
more
than
his
life
,
the
life
of
the
woman
he
loved
;
this
was
,
*NL*
in
case
of
ill
fortune
,
a
means
of
temporizing
and
obtaining
good
*NL*
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
this
point
was
settled
;
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
without
any
suspicion
,
*NL*
accompanied
her
.
Once
concealed
with
her
at
Armentieres
,
it
would
be
*NL*
easy
to
make
her
believe
that
d'Artagnan
had
not
come
to
Bethune
.
In
*NL*
fifteen
days
at
most
,
Rochefort
would
be
back
;
besides
,
during
that
*NL*
fifteen
days
she
would
have
time
to
think
how
she
could
best
avenge
*NL*
herself
on
the
four
friends
.
She
would
not
be
weary
,
thank
God
!
for
she
*NL*
should
enjoy
the
sweetest
pastime
such
events
could
accord
a
woman
of
*NL*
her
character
--
perfecting
a
beautiful
vengeance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolving
all
this
in
her
mind
,
she
cast
her
eyes
around
her
,
and
*NL*
arranged
the
topography
of
the
garden
in
her
head
.
Milady
was
like
a
*NL*
good
general
who
contemplates
at
the
same
time
victory
and
defeat
,
and
*NL*
who
is
quite
prepared
,
according
to
the
chances
of
the
battle
,
to
march
*NL*
forward
or
to
beat
a
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
an
hour
she
heard
a
soft
voice
calling
her
;
it
was
Mme.
*NL*
Bonacieux
's
.
The
good
abbess
had
naturally
consented
to
her
request
;
and
*NL*
as
a
commencement
,
they
were
to
sup
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
courtyard
,
they
heard
the
noise
of
a
carriage
which
*NL*
stopped
at
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
anything
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
rolling
of
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
one
my
brother
sends
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
courage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
of
the
convent
gate
was
sounded
;
Milady
was
not
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
your
chamber
,
''
said
she
to
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
you
have
perhaps
some
*NL*
jewels
you
would
like
to
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
his
letters
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
and
fetch
them
,
and
come
to
my
apartment
.
We
will
snatch
some
*NL*
supper
;
we
shall
perhaps
travel
part
of
the
night
,
and
must
keep
our
*NL*
strength
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
God
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
placing
her
hand
upon
her
bosom
,
``
my
*NL*
heart
beats
so
I
can
not
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
,
courage
!
remember
that
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
will
be
*NL*
safe
;
and
think
that
what
you
are
about
to
do
is
for
HIS
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
everything
for
him
.
You
have
restored
my
courage
by
a
single
*NL*
word
;
go
,
I
will
rejoin
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
ran
up
to
her
apartment
quickly
;
she
there
found
Rochefort
's
*NL*
lackey
,
and
gave
him
his
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
to
wait
at
the
gate
;
if
by
chance
the
Musketeers
should
appear
,
*NL*
the
carriage
was
to
set
off
as
fast
as
possible
,
pass
around
the
*NL*
convent
,
and
go
and
wait
for
Milady
at
a
little
village
which
was
*NL*
situated
at
the
other
side
of
the
wood
.
In
this
case
Milady
would
cross
*NL*
the
garden
and
gain
the
village
on
foot
.
As
we
have
already
said
,
Milady
*NL*
was
admirably
acquainted
with
this
part
of
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
Musketeers
did
not
appear
,
things
were
to
go
on
as
had
been
*NL*
agreed
;
Mme.
Bonacieux
was
to
get
into
the
carriage
as
if
to
bid
her
*NL*
adieu
,
and
she
was
to
take
away
Mme.
Bonacieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
came
in
;
and
to
remove
all
suspicion
,
if
she
had
any
,
*NL*
Milady
repeated
to
the
lackey
,
before
her
,
the
latter
part
of
her
*NL*
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
asked
some
questions
about
the
carriage
.
It
was
a
chaise
drawn
by
*NL*
three
horses
,
driven
by
a
postillion
;
Rochefort
's
lackey
would
precede
*NL*
it
,
as
courier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
was
wrong
in
fearing
that
Mme.
Bonacieux
would
have
any
*NL*
suspicion
.
The
poor
young
woman
was
too
pure
to
suppose
that
any
female
*NL*
could
be
guilty
of
such
perfidy
;
besides
,
the
name
of
the
Comtesse
de
*NL*
Winter
,
which
she
had
heard
the
abbess
pronounce
,
was
wholly
unknown
to
*NL*
her
,
and
she
was
even
ignorant
that
a
woman
had
had
so
great
and
so
*NL*
fatal
a
share
in
the
misfortune
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
she
,
when
the
lackey
had
gone
out
,
``
everything
is
ready
.
*NL*
The
abbess
suspects
nothing
,
and
believes
that
I
am
taken
by
order
of
*NL*
the
cardinal
.
This
man
goes
to
give
his
last
orders
;
take
the
least
*NL*
thing
,
drink
a
finger
of
wine
,
and
let
us
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
mechanically
,
``
yes
,
let
us
be
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
made
her
a
sign
to
sit
down
opposite
,
poured
her
a
small
glass
of
*NL*
Spanish
wine
,
and
helped
her
to
the
wing
of
a
chicken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
everything
does
not
second
us
!
Here
is
night
coming
*NL*
on
;
by
daybreak
we
shall
have
reached
our
retreat
,
and
nobody
can
guess
*NL*
where
we
are
.
Come
,
courage
!
take
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
ate
a
few
mouthfuls
mechanically
,
and
just
touched
the
*NL*
glass
with
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
!
''
said
Milady
,
lifting
hers
to
her
mouth
,
``
do
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
the
glass
touched
her
lips
,
her
hand
remained
*NL*
suspended
;
she
heard
something
on
the
road
which
sounded
like
the
*NL*
rattling
of
a
distant
gallop
.
Then
it
grew
nearer
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
,
*NL*
almost
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
heard
the
neighing
of
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
noise
acted
upon
her
joy
like
the
storm
which
awakens
the
sleeper
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
dream
;
she
grew
pale
and
ran
to
the
window
,
*NL*
while
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
rising
all
in
a
tremble
,
supported
herself
upon
*NL*
her
chair
to
avoid
falling
.
Nothing
was
yet
to
be
seen
,
only
they
heard
*NL*
the
galloping
draw
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
what
is
that
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of
either
our
friends
or
our
enemies
,
''
said
Milady
,
with
her
*NL*
terrible
coolness
.
``
Stay
where
you
are
,
I
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
remained
standing
,
mute
,
motionless
,
and
pale
as
a
*NL*
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
became
louder
;
the
horses
could
not
be
more
than
a
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
paces
distant
.
If
they
were
not
yet
to
be
seen
,
it
was
because
the
*NL*
road
made
an
elbow
.
The
noise
became
so
distinct
that
the
horses
might
*NL*
be
counted
by
the
rattle
of
their
hoofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
gazed
with
all
the
power
of
her
attention
;
it
was
just
light
*NL*
enough
for
her
to
see
who
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
at
the
turning
of
the
road
she
saw
the
glitter
of
laced
*NL*
hats
and
the
waving
of
feathers
;
she
counted
two
,
then
five
,
then
eight
*NL*
horsemen
.
One
of
them
preceded
the
rest
by
double
the
length
of
his
*NL*
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
uttered
a
stifled
groan
.
In
the
first
horseman
she
recognized
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
,
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
uniform
of
the
cardinal
's
Guards
.
Not
an
instant
to
be
lost
!
*NL*
Fly
,
fly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
let
us
fly
!
''
repeated
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
but
without
being
able
*NL*
to
make
a
step
,
glued
as
she
was
to
the
spot
by
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
the
horsemen
pass
under
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
,
come
,
then
!
''
cried
Milady
,
trying
to
drag
the
young
woman
*NL*
along
by
the
arm
.
``
Thanks
to
the
garden
,
we
yet
can
flee
;
I
have
the
*NL*
key
,
but
make
haste
!
in
five
minutes
it
will
be
too
late
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
tried
to
walk
,
made
two
steps
,
and
sank
upon
her
knees
.
*NL*
Milady
tried
to
raise
and
carry
her
,
but
could
not
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
they
heard
the
rolling
of
the
carriage
,
which
at
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
Musketeers
set
off
at
a
gallop
.
Then
three
or
four
shots
*NL*
were
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
last
time
,
will
you
come
?
''
cried
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
you
see
my
strength
fails
me
;
you
see
plainly
I
*NL*
can
not
walk
.
Flee
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flee
alone
,
and
leave
you
here
?
No
,
no
,
never
!
''
cried
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
paused
,
a
livid
flash
darted
from
her
eyes
;
she
ran
to
*NL*
the
table
,
emptied
into
Mme.
Bonacieux
's
glass
the
contents
of
a
ring
*NL*
which
she
opened
with
singular
quickness
.
It
was
a
grain
of
a
reddish
*NL*
color
,
which
dissolved
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
taking
the
glass
with
a
firm
hand
,
she
said
,
``
Drink
.
This
wine
*NL*
will
give
you
strength
,
drink
!
''
And
she
put
the
glass
to
the
lips
of
the
*NL*
young
woman
,
who
drank
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
the
way
that
I
wished
to
avenge
myself
,
''
said
Milady
,
*NL*
replacing
the
glass
upon
the
table
,
with
an
infernal
smile
,
``
but
,
my
*NL*
faith
!
we
do
what
we
can
!
''
And
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
saw
her
go
without
being
able
to
follow
her
;
she
was
like
*NL*
people
who
dream
they
are
pursued
,
and
who
in
vain
try
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
passed
;
a
great
noise
was
heard
at
the
gate
.
Every
instant
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
expected
to
see
Milady
,
but
she
did
not
return
.
Several
*NL*
times
,
with
terror
,
no
doubt
,
the
cold
sweat
burst
from
her
burning
*NL*
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
heard
the
grating
of
the
hinges
of
the
opening
gates
;
the
*NL*
noise
of
boots
and
spurs
resounded
on
the
stairs
.
There
was
a
great
*NL*
murmur
of
voices
which
continued
to
draw
near
,
amid
which
she
seemed
to
*NL*
hear
her
own
name
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
joy
,
and
darted
toward
the
door
;
*NL*
she
had
recognized
the
voice
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
!
D'Artagnan
!
''
cried
she
,
``
is
it
you
?
This
way
!
this
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Constance
?
Constance
?
''
replied
the
young
man
,
``
where
are
you
?
where
are
*NL*
you
?
My
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
the
door
of
the
cell
yielded
to
a
shock
,
rather
than
*NL*
opened
;
several
men
rushed
into
the
chamber
.
Mme.
Bonacieux
had
sunk
*NL*
into
an
armchair
,
without
the
power
of
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
threw
down
a
yet-smoking
pistol
which
he
held
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
his
mistress
.
Athos
replaced
his
in
his
*NL*
belt
;
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
who
held
their
drawn
swords
in
their
hands
,
*NL*
returned
them
to
their
scabbards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
d'Artagnan
,
my
beloved
d'Artagnan
!
You
have
come
,
then
,
at
last
!
*NL*
You
have
not
deceived
me
!
It
is
indeed
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
Constance
.
Reunited
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
in
vain
she
told
me
you
would
not
come
!
I
hoped
in
silence
.
*NL*
I
was
not
willing
to
fly
.
Oh
,
I
have
done
well
!
How
happy
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
word
SHE
,
Athos
,
who
had
seated
himself
quietly
,
started
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
SHE
!
What
she
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
companion
.
She
who
out
of
friendship
for
me
wished
to
take
me
*NL*
from
my
persecutors
.
She
who
,
mistaking
you
for
the
cardinal
's
Guards
,
*NL*
has
just
fled
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
companion
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
becoming
more
pale
than
the
white
*NL*
veil
of
his
mistress
.
``
Of
what
companion
are
you
speaking
,
dear
*NL*
Constance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
her
whose
carriage
was
at
the
gate
;
of
a
woman
who
calls
herself
*NL*
your
friend
;
of
a
woman
to
whom
you
have
told
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
name
,
her
name
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
My
God
,
can
you
not
remember
*NL*
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
pronounced
in
my
hearing
once
.
Stop
--
but
--
it
is
very
*NL*
strange
--
oh
,
my
God
,
my
head
swims
!
I
can
not
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
,
help
,
my
friends
!
her
hands
are
icy
cold
,
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
She
*NL*
is
ill
!
Great
God
,
she
is
losing
her
senses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Porthos
was
calling
for
help
with
all
the
power
of
his
strong
*NL*
voice
,
Aramis
ran
to
the
table
to
get
a
glass
of
water
;
but
he
stopped
*NL*
at
seeing
the
horrible
alteration
that
had
taken
place
in
the
*NL*
countenance
of
Athos
,
who
,
standing
before
the
table
,
his
hair
rising
*NL*
from
his
head
,
his
eyes
fixed
in
stupor
,
was
looking
at
one
of
the
*NL*
glasses
,
and
appeared
a
prey
to
the
most
horrible
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Athos
,
``
oh
,
no
,
it
is
impossible
!
God
would
not
permit
such
a
*NL*
crime
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
,
water
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
``
Water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
woman
,
poor
woman
!
''
murmured
Athos
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Bonacieux
opened
her
eyes
under
the
kisses
of
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
revives
!
''
cried
the
young
man
.
``
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
,
I
thank
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame

''
said
Athos
,
``
madame

in
the
name
of
heaven
,
whose
empty
glass
*NL*
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
young
woman
,
in
a
dying
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
poured
the
wine
for
you
that
was
in
this
glass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
is
SHE
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
remember
!
''
said
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
the
Comtesse
de
Winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
friends
uttered
one
and
the
same
cry
,
but
that
of
Athos
*NL*
dominated
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
countenance
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
became
livid
;
a
fearful
*NL*
agony
pervaded
her
frame
,
and
she
sank
panting
into
the
arms
of
Porthos
*NL*
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
seized
the
hands
of
Athos
with
an
anguish
difficult
to
be
*NL*
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
believe
?
'
His
voice
was
stifled
by
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
everything
,
''
said
Athos
,
biting
his
lips
till
the
blood
*NL*
sprang
to
avoid
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
d'Artagnan
!
''
cried
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
``
where
art
thou
?
Do
not
*NL*
leave
me
!
You
see
I
am
dying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
released
the
hands
of
Athos
which
he
still
held
clasped
in
*NL*
both
his
own
,
and
hastened
to
her
.
Her
beautiful
face
was
distorted
with
*NL*
agony
;
her
glassy
eyes
had
no
longer
their
sight
;
a
convulsive
*NL*
shuddering
shook
her
whole
body
;
the
sweat
rolled
from
her
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
run
,
call
!
Aramis
!
Porthos
!
Call
for
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Useless
!
''
said
Athos
,
``
useless
!
For
the
poison
which
SHE
pours
there
is
*NL*
no
antidote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
Help
,
help
!
''
murmured
Mme.
Bonacieux
;
``
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
collecting
all
her
strength
,
she
took
the
head
of
the
young
man
*NL*
between
her
hands
,
looked
at
him
for
an
instant
as
if
her
whole
soul
*NL*
passed
into
that
look
,
and
with
a
sobbing
cry
pressed
her
lips
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Constance
,
Constance
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sigh
escaped
from
the
mouth
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
,
and
dwelt
for
an
*NL*
instant
on
the
lips
of
d'Artagnan
.
That
sigh
was
the
soul
,
so
chaste
and
*NL*
so
loving
,
which
reascended
to
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
pressed
nothing
but
a
corpse
in
his
arms
.
The
young
man
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
,
and
fell
by
the
side
of
his
mistress
as
pale
and
as
icy
*NL*
as
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
wept
;
Aramis
pointed
toward
heaven
;
Athos
made
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
man
appeared
in
the
doorway
,
almost
as
pale
as
those
in
*NL*
the
chamber
.
He
looked
around
him
and
saw
Mme.
Bonacieux
dead
,
and
*NL*
d'Artagnan
in
a
swoon
.
He
appeared
just
at
that
moment
of
stupor
which
*NL*
follows
great
catastrophes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
deceived
,
''
said
he
;
``
here
is
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
;
and
you
are
*NL*
his
friends
,
Messieurs
Athos
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
persons
whose
names
were
thus
pronounced
looked
at
the
stranger
with
*NL*
astonishment
.
It
seemed
to
all
three
that
they
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
resumed
the
newcomer
,
``
you
are
,
as
I
am
,
in
search
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
,
''
added
he
,
with
a
terrible
smile
,
``
must
have
passed
this
way
,
*NL*
for
I
see
a
corpse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
friends
remained
mute
--
for
although
the
voice
as
well
as
the
*NL*
countenance
reminded
them
of
someone
they
had
seen
,
they
could
not
*NL*
remember
under
what
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
stranger
,
``
since
you
do
not
recognize
a
man
*NL*
who
probably
owes
his
life
to
you
twice
,
I
must
name
myself
.
I
am
Lord
*NL*
de
Winter
,
brother-in-law
of
THAT
WOMAN
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
friends
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
rose
,
and
offering
him
his
hand
,
``
Be
welcome
,
my
Lord
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
you
are
one
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
set
out
five
hours
after
her
from
Portsmouth
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
.
*NL*
``
I
arrived
three
hours
after
her
at
Boulogne
.
I
missed
her
by
twenty
*NL*
minutes
at
St.
Omer
.
Finally
,
at
Lilliers
I
lost
all
trace
of
her
.
I
was
*NL*
going
about
at
random
,
inquiring
of
everybody
,
when
I
saw
you
gallop
*NL*
past
.
I
recognized
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
.
I
called
to
you
,
but
you
did
not
*NL*
answer
me
;
I
wished
to
follow
you
,
but
my
horse
was
too
much
fatigued
to
*NL*
go
at
the
same
pace
with
yours
.
And
yet
it
appears
,
in
spite
of
all
your
*NL*
diligence
,
you
have
arrived
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
!
''
said
Athos
,
pointing
to
Mme.
Bonacieux
dead
,
and
to
*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
whom
Porthos
and
Aramis
were
trying
to
recall
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
both
dead
?
''
asked
Lord
de
Winter
,
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Athos
,
``
fortunately
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
has
only
fainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
indeed
,
so
much
the
better
!
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
d'Artagnan
opened
his
eyes
.
He
tore
himself
from
the
arms
*NL*
of
Porthos
and
Aramis
,
and
threw
himself
like
a
madman
on
the
corpse
of
*NL*
his
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
rose
,
walked
toward
his
friend
with
a
slow
and
solemn
step
,
*NL*
embraced
him
tenderly
,
and
as
he
burst
into
violent
sobs
,
he
said
to
him
*NL*
with
his
noble
and
persuasive
voice
,
``
Friend
,
be
a
man
!
Women
weep
for
*NL*
the
dead
;
men
avenge
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
cried
d'Artagnan
,
``
yes
!
If
it
be
to
avenge
her
,
I
am
ready
to
*NL*
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
profited
by
this
moment
of
strength
which
the
hope
of
vengeance
*NL*
restored
to
his
unfortunate
friend
to
make
a
sign
to
Porthos
and
Aramis
*NL*
to
go
and
fetch
the
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
met
her
in
the
corridor
,
greatly
troubled
and
much
upset
*NL*
by
such
strange
events
;
she
called
some
of
the
nuns
,
who
against
all
*NL*
monastic
custom
found
themselves
in
the
presence
of
five
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
Athos
,
passing
his
arm
under
that
of
d'Artagnan
,
``
we
*NL*
abandon
to
your
pious
care
the
body
of
that
unfortunate
woman
.
She
was
*NL*
an
angel
on
earth
before
being
an
angel
in
heaven
.
Treat
her
as
one
of
*NL*
your
sisters
.
We
will
return
someday
to
pray
over
her
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
concealed
his
face
in
the
bosom
of
Athos
,
and
sobbed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weep
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
weep
,
heart
full
of
love
,
youth
,
and
life
!
Alas
,
*NL*
would
I
could
weep
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
drew
away
his
friend
,
as
affectionate
as
a
father
,
as
consoling
*NL*
as
a
priest
,
noble
as
a
man
who
has
suffered
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
five
,
followed
by
their
lackeys
leading
their
horses
,
took
their
way
*NL*
to
the
town
of
Bethune
,
whose
outskirts
they
perceived
,
and
stopped
*NL*
before
the
first
inn
they
came
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
``
shall
we
not
pursue
that
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Later
,
''
said
Athos
.
``
I
have
measures
to
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
escape
us
,
''
replied
the
young
man
;
``
she
will
escape
us
,
and
it
*NL*
will
be
your
fault
,
Athos
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
accountable
for
her
,
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
had
so
much
confidence
in
the
word
of
his
friend
that
he
*NL*
lowered
his
head
,
and
entered
the
inn
without
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
and
Aramis
regarded
each
other
,
not
understanding
this
assurance
*NL*
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
believed
he
spoke
in
this
manner
to
soothe
the
grief
of
*NL*
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
when
he
had
ascertained
there
were
five
*NL*
chambers
free
in
the
hotel
,
``
let
everyone
retire
to
his
own
apartment
.
*NL*
d'Artagnan
needs
to
be
alone
,
to
weep
and
to
sleep
.
I
take
charge
of
*NL*
everything
;
be
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
,
however
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
,
``
if
there
are
any
measures
*NL*
to
take
against
the
countess
,
it
concerns
me
;
she
is
my
sister-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
,
''
said
Athos
,
''
--
she
is
my
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
smiled
--
for
he
understood
that
Athos
was
sure
of
his
*NL*
vengeance
when
he
revealed
such
a
secret
.
Porthos
and
Aramis
looked
at
*NL*
each
other
,
and
grew
pale
.
Lord
de
Winter
thought
Athos
was
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
retire
to
your
chambers
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
and
leave
me
to
act

You
*NL*
must
perceive
that
in
my
quality
of
a
husband
this
concerns
me

Only

*NL*
d'Artagnan
,
if
you
have
not
lost
it

give
me
the
paper

fell
from

that
man

hat

written
the
name

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
d'Artagnan
,
``
I
comprehend

that
name
written
in
her
hand

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see

Athos

there

THE
MAN
IN
THE
RED
CLOAK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
despair
of
Athos
had
given
place
to
a
concentrated
grief
which
only
*NL*
rendered
more
lucid
the
brilliant
mental
faculties
of
that
extraordinary
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possessed
by
one
single
thought
--
that
of
the
promise
he
had
made
,
and
of
*NL*
the
responsibility
he
had
taken
--
he
retired
last
to
his
chamber
,
begged
*NL*
the
host
to
procure
him
a
map
of
the
province
,
bent
over
it
,
examined
*NL*
every
line
traced
upon
it
,
perceived
that
there
were
four
different
*NL*
roads
from
Bethune
to
Armentieres
,
and
summoned
the
lackeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
,
Grimaud
,
Bazin
,
and
Mousqueton
presented
themselves
,
and
*NL*
received
clear
,
positive
,
and
serious
orders
from
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
must
set
out
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
,
and
go
to
*NL*
Armentieres
--
each
by
a
different
route
.
Planchet
,
the
most
intelligent
*NL*
of
the
four
,
was
to
follow
that
by
which
the
carriage
had
gone
upon
*NL*
which
the
four
friends
had
fired
,
and
which
was
accompanied
,
as
may
be
*NL*
remembered
,
by
Rochefort
's
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
set
the
lackeys
to
work
first
because
,
since
these
men
had
been
in
*NL*
the
service
of
himself
and
his
friends
he
had
discovered
in
each
of
them
*NL*
different
and
essential
qualities
.
Then
,
lackeys
who
ask
questions
*NL*
inspire
less
mistrust
than
masters
,
and
meet
with
more
sympathy
among
*NL*
those
to
whom
they
address
themselves
.
Besides
,
Milady
knew
the
masters
,
*NL*
and
did
not
know
the
lackeys
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
lackeys
knew
Milady
*NL*
perfectly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
four
were
to
meet
the
next
day
at
eleven
o'clock
.
If
they
had
*NL*
discovered
Milady
's
retreat
,
three
were
to
remain
on
guard
;
the
fourth
*NL*
was
to
return
to
Bethune
in
order
to
inform
Athos
and
serve
as
a
guide
*NL*
to
the
four
friends
.
These
arrangements
made
,
the
lackeys
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
then
arose
from
his
chair
,
girded
on
his
sword
,
enveloped
himself
*NL*
in
his
cloak
,
and
left
the
hotel
.
It
was
nearly
ten
o'clock
.
At
ten
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
it
is
well
known
,
the
streets
in
provincial
*NL*
towns
are
very
little
frequented
.
Athos
nevertheless
was
visibly
anxious
*NL*
to
find
someone
of
whom
he
could
ask
a
question
.
At
length
he
met
a
*NL*
belated
passenger
,
went
up
to
him
,
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
him
.
The
man
*NL*
he
addressed
recoiled
with
terror
,
and
only
answered
the
few
words
of
*NL*
the
Musketeer
by
pointing
.
Athos
offered
the
man
half
a
pistole
to
*NL*
accompany
him
,
but
the
man
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
then
plunged
into
the
street
the
man
had
indicated
with
his
*NL*
finger
;
but
arriving
at
four
crossroads
,
he
stopped
again
,
visibly
*NL*
embarrassed
.
Nevertheless
,
as
the
crossroads
offered
him
a
better
chance
*NL*
than
any
other
place
of
meeting
somebody
,
he
stood
still
.
In
a
few
*NL*
minutes
a
night
watch
passed
.
Athos
repeated
to
him
the
same
question
he
*NL*
had
asked
the
first
person
he
met
.
The
night
watch
evinced
the
same
*NL*
terror
,
refused
,
in
his
turn
,
to
accompany
Athos
,
and
only
pointed
with
*NL*
his
hand
to
the
road
he
was
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
walked
in
the
direction
indicated
,
and
reached
the
suburb
situated
*NL*
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
city
from
that
by
which
he
and
his
*NL*
friends
had
entered
it
.
There
he
again
appeared
uneasy
and
embarrassed
,
*NL*
and
stopped
for
the
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
a
mendicant
passed
,
who
,
coming
up
to
Athos
to
ask
charity
,
*NL*
Athos
offered
him
half
a
crown
to
accompany
him
where
he
was
going
.
The
*NL*
mendicant
hesitated
at
first
,
but
at
the
sight
of
the
piece
of
silver
*NL*
which
shone
in
the
darkness
he
consented
,
and
walked
on
before
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arrived
at
the
angle
of
a
street
,
he
pointed
to
a
small
house
,
isolated
,
*NL*
solitary
,
and
dismal
.
Athos
went
toward
the
house
,
while
the
mendicant
,
*NL*
who
had
received
his
reward
,
left
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
went
round
the
house
before
he
could
distinguish
the
door
,
amid
*NL*
the
red
color
in
which
the
house
was
painted
.
No
light
appeared
through
*NL*
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
;
no
noise
gave
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
*NL*
inhabited
.
It
was
dark
and
silent
as
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
times
Athos
knocked
without
receiving
an
answer
.
At
the
third
*NL*
knock
,
however
,
steps
were
heard
inside
.
The
door
at
length
was
opened
,
*NL*
and
a
man
appeared
,
of
high
stature
,
pale
complexion
,
and
black
hair
and
*NL*
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
and
he
exchanged
some
words
in
a
low
voice
,
then
the
tall
man
made
*NL*
a
sign
to
the
Musketeer
that
he
might
come
in
.
Athos
immediately
*NL*
profited
by
the
permission
,
and
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
whom
Athos
had
come
so
far
to
seek
,
and
whom
he
had
found
with
*NL*
so
much
trouble
,
introduced
him
into
his
laboratory
,
where
he
was
*NL*
engaged
in
fastening
together
with
iron
wire
the
dry
bones
of
a
*NL*
skeleton
.
All
the
frame
was
adjusted
except
the
head
,
which
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
rest
of
the
furniture
indicated
that
the
dweller
in
this
house
*NL*
occupied
himself
with
the
study
of
natural
science
.
There
were
large
*NL*
bottles
filled
with
serpents
,
ticketed
according
to
their
species
;
dried
*NL*
lizards
shone
like
emeralds
set
in
great
squares
of
black
wood
,
and
*NL*
bunches
of
wild
odoriferous
herbs
,
doubtless
possessed
of
virtues
*NL*
unknown
to
common
men
,
were
fastened
to
the
ceiling
and
hung
down
in
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
apartment
.
There
was
no
family
,
no
servant
;
the
tall
man
*NL*
alone
inhabited
this
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
cast
a
cold
and
indifferent
glance
upon
the
objects
we
have
*NL*
described
,
and
at
the
invitation
of
him
whom
he
came
to
seek
sat
down
*NL*
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
explained
to
him
the
cause
of
his
visit
,
and
the
service
he
*NL*
required
of
him
.
But
scarcely
had
he
expressed
his
request
when
the
*NL*
unknown
,
who
remained
standing
before
the
Musketeer
,
drew
back
with
*NL*
signs
of
terror
,
and
refused
.
Then
Athos
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
*NL*
paper
,
on
which
two
lines
were
written
,
accompanied
by
a
signature
and
a
*NL*
seal
,
and
presented
them
to
him
who
had
made
too
prematurely
these
signs
*NL*
of
repugnance
.
The
tall
man
had
scarcely
read
these
lines
,
seen
the
*NL*
signature
,
and
recognized
the
seal
,
when
he
bowed
to
denote
that
he
had
*NL*
no
longer
any
objection
to
make
,
and
that
he
was
ready
to
obey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
required
no
more
.
He
arose
,
bowed
,
went
out
,
returned
by
the
same
*NL*
way
he
came
,
re-entered
the
hotel
,
and
went
to
his
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
d'Artagnan
entered
the
chamber
,
and
demanded
what
was
to
be
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
wait
,
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
minutes
after
,
the
superior
of
the
convent
sent
to
inform
the
*NL*
Musketeers
that
the
burial
would
take
place
at
midday
.
As
to
the
*NL*
poisoner
,
they
had
heard
no
tidings
of
her
whatever
,
only
that
she
must
*NL*
have
made
her
escape
through
the
garden
,
on
the
sand
of
which
her
*NL*
footsteps
could
be
traced
,
and
the
door
of
which
had
been
found
shut
.
As
*NL*
to
the
key
,
it
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
appointed
,
Lord
de
Winter
and
the
four
friends
repaired
to
*NL*
the
convent
;
the
bells
tolled
,
the
chapel
was
open
,
the
grating
of
the
*NL*
choir
was
closed
.
In
the
middle
of
the
choir
the
body
of
the
victim
,
*NL*
clothed
in
her
novitiate
dress
,
was
exposed
.
On
each
side
of
the
choir
*NL*
and
behind
the
gratings
opening
into
the
convent
was
assembled
the
whole
*NL*
community
of
the
Carmelites
,
who
listened
to
the
divine
service
,
and
*NL*
mingled
their
chant
with
the
chant
of
the
priests
,
without
seeing
the
*NL*
profane
,
or
being
seen
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
of
the
chapel
d'Artagnan
felt
his
courage
fall
anew
,
and
*NL*
returned
to
look
for
Athos
;
but
Athos
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Faithful
to
his
mission
of
vengeance
,
Athos
had
requested
to
be
*NL*
conducted
to
the
garden
;
and
there
upon
the
sand
following
the
light
*NL*
steps
of
this
woman
,
who
left
sharp
tracks
wherever
she
went
,
he
*NL*
advanced
toward
the
gate
which
led
into
the
wood
,
and
causing
it
to
be
*NL*
opened
,
he
went
out
into
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
;
the
road
by
which
the
carriage
*NL*
had
disappeared
encircled
the
forest
.
Athos
followed
the
road
for
some
*NL*
time
,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
;
slight
stains
of
blood
,
which
came
*NL*
from
the
wound
inflicted
upon
the
man
who
accompanied
the
carriage
as
a
*NL*
courier
,
or
from
one
of
the
horses
,
dotted
the
road
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
three-quarters
of
a
league
,
within
fifty
paces
of
Festubert
,
a
larger
*NL*
bloodstain
appeared
;
the
ground
was
trampled
by
horses
.
Between
the
*NL*
forest
and
this
accursed
spot
,
a
little
behind
the
trampled
ground
,
was
*NL*
the
same
track
of
small
feet
as
in
the
garden
;
the
carriage
had
stopped
*NL*
here
.
At
this
spot
Milady
had
come
out
of
the
wood
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
with
this
discovery
which
confirmed
all
his
suspicions
,
Athos
*NL*
returned
to
the
hotel
,
and
found
Planchet
impatiently
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
as
Athos
had
foreseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
had
followed
the
road
;
like
Athos
,
he
had
discovered
the
stains
*NL*
of
blood
;
like
Athos
,
he
had
noted
the
spot
where
the
horses
had
halted
.
*NL*
But
he
had
gone
farther
than
Athos
--
for
at
the
village
of
Festubert
,
*NL*
while
drinking
at
an
inn
,
he
had
learned
without
needing
to
ask
a
*NL*
question
that
the
evening
before
,
at
half-past
eight
,
a
wounded
man
who
*NL*
accompanied
a
lady
traveling
in
a
post-chaise
had
been
obliged
to
stop
,
*NL*
unable
to
go
further
.
The
accident
was
set
down
to
the
account
of
*NL*
robbers
,
who
had
stopped
the
chaise
in
the
wood
.
The
man
remained
in
the
*NL*
village
;
the
woman
had
had
a
relay
of
horses
,
and
continued
her
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
went
in
search
of
the
postillion
who
had
driven
her
,
and
found
*NL*
him
.
He
had
taken
the
lady
as
far
as
Fromelles
;
and
from
Fromelles
she
*NL*
had
set
out
for
Armentieres
.
Planchet
took
the
crossroad
,
and
by
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
he
was
at
Armentieres
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
tavern
,
the
Post
.
Planchet
went
and
presented
himself
*NL*
as
a
lackey
out
of
a
place
,
who
was
in
search
of
a
situation
.
He
had
not
*NL*
chatted
ten
minutes
with
the
people
of
the
tavern
before
he
learned
that
*NL*
a
woman
had
come
there
alone
about
eleven
o'clock
the
night
before
,
had
*NL*
engaged
a
chamber
,
had
sent
for
the
master
of
the
hotel
,
and
told
him
*NL*
she
desired
to
remain
some
time
in
the
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
had
no
need
to
learn
more
.
He
hastened
to
the
rendezvous
,
found
*NL*
the
lackeys
at
their
posts
,
placed
them
as
sentinels
at
all
the
outlets
*NL*
of
the
hotel
,
and
came
to
find
Athos
,
who
had
just
received
this
*NL*
information
when
his
friends
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
their
countenances
were
melancholy
and
gloomy
,
even
the
mild
*NL*
countenance
of
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
asked
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
wait
!
''
replied
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
retired
to
his
own
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
Athos
ordered
the
horses
to
be
saddled
,
*NL*
and
Lord
de
Winter
and
his
friends
notified
that
they
must
prepare
for
*NL*
the
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
all
five
were
ready
.
Each
examined
his
arms
,
and
put
them
*NL*
in
order
.
Athos
came
down
last
,
and
found
d'Artagnan
already
on
*NL*
horseback
,
and
growing
impatient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patience
!
''
cried
Athos
;
``
one
of
our
party
is
still
wanting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
horsemen
looked
round
them
with
astonishment
,
for
they
sought
*NL*
vainly
in
their
minds
to
know
who
this
other
person
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Planchet
brought
out
Athos
's
horse
;
the
Musketeer
leaped
*NL*
lightly
into
the
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
me
,
''
cried
he
,
``
I
will
soon
be
back
,
''
and
he
set
off
at
a
*NL*
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
returned
,
accompanied
by
a
tall
man
,
masked
,
*NL*
and
wrapped
in
a
large
red
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
and
the
three
Musketeers
looked
at
one
another
*NL*
inquiringly
.
Neither
could
give
the
others
any
information
,
for
all
were
*NL*
ignorant
who
this
man
could
be
;
nevertheless
,
they
felt
convinced
that
*NL*
all
was
as
it
should
be
,
as
it
was
done
by
the
order
of
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
,
guided
by
Planchet
,
the
little
cavalcade
set
out
,
*NL*
taking
the
route
the
carriage
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
melancholy
sight
--
that
of
these
six
men
,
traveling
in
silence
,
*NL*
each
plunged
in
his
own
thoughts
,
sad
as
despair
,
gloomy
as
*NL*
chastisement
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

TRIAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
stormy
and
dark
night
;
vast
clouds
covered
the
heavens
,
*NL*
concealing
the
stars
;
the
moon
would
not
rise
till
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
,
by
the
light
of
a
flash
of
lightning
which
gleamed
along
*NL*
the
horizon
,
the
road
stretched
itself
before
them
,
white
and
solitary
;
*NL*
the
flash
extinct
,
all
remained
in
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
minute
Athos
was
forced
to
restrain
d'Artagnan
,
constantly
in
*NL*
advance
of
the
little
troop
,
and
to
beg
him
to
keep
in
the
line
,
which
*NL*
in
an
instant
he
again
departed
from
.
He
had
but
one
thought
--
to
go
*NL*
forward
;
and
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
in
silence
through
the
little
village
of
Festubert
,
where
*NL*
the
wounded
servant
was
,
and
then
skirted
the
wood
of
Richebourg
.
At
*NL*
Herlier
,
Planchet
,
who
led
the
column
,
turned
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
Lord
de
Winter
,
Porthos
,
or
Aramis
tried
to
talk
with
the
*NL*
man
in
the
red
cloak
;
but
to
every
interrogation
which
they
put
to
him
*NL*
he
bowed
,
without
response
.
The
travelers
then
comprehended
that
there
*NL*
must
be
some
reason
why
the
unknown
preserved
such
a
silence
,
and
ceased
*NL*
to
address
themselves
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
increased
,
the
flashes
succeeded
one
another
more
rapidly
,
the
*NL*
thunder
began
to
growl
,
and
the
wind
,
the
precursor
of
a
hurricane
,
*NL*
whistled
in
the
plumes
and
the
hair
of
the
horsemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cavalcade
trotted
on
more
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
before
they
came
to
Fromelles
the
storm
burst
.
They
spread
*NL*
their
cloaks
.
There
remained
three
leagues
to
travel
,
and
they
did
it
*NL*
amid
torrents
of
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
off
his
hat
,
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
make
use
of
*NL*
his
cloak
.
He
found
pleasure
in
feeling
the
water
trickle
over
his
*NL*
burning
brow
and
over
his
body
,
agitated
by
feverish
shudders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
little
troop
passed
Goskal
and
were
approaching
the
Post
,
*NL*
a
man
sheltered
beneath
a
tree
detached
himself
from
the
trunk
with
*NL*
which
he
had
been
confounded
in
the
darkness
,
and
advanced
into
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
road
,
putting
his
finger
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
recognized
Grimaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
manner
?
''
cried
Athos
.
``
Has
she
left
Armentieres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
D'Artagnan
ground
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
d'Artagnan
!
''
said
Athos
.
``
I
have
charged
myself
with
this
*NL*
affair
.
It
is
for
me
,
then
,
to
interrogate
Grimaud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
extended
his
hands
in
the
direction
of
the
Lys
.
``
Far
from
here
?
''
*NL*
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
showed
his
master
his
forefinger
bent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
made
the
sign
yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
she
is
alone
within
half
a
league
of
us
,
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
river
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
``
Lead
us
,
Grimaud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
took
his
course
across
the
country
,
and
acted
as
guide
to
the
*NL*
cavalcade
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
five
hundred
paces
,
more
or
less
,
they
came
to
a
rivulet
,
*NL*
which
they
forded
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
aid
of
the
lightning
they
perceived
the
village
of
Erquinheim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
there
,
Grimaud
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
shook
his
head
negatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
then
!
''
cried
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
troop
continued
their
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
flash
illuminated
all
around
them
.
Grimaud
extended
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
by
the
bluish
splendor
of
the
fiery
serpent
they
distinguished
a
little
*NL*
isolated
house
on
the
banks
of
the
river
,
within
a
hundred
paces
of
a
*NL*
ferry
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
window
was
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
!
''
said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
man
who
had
been
crouching
in
a
ditch
jumped
up
and
*NL*
came
towards
them
.
It
was
Mousqueton
.
He
pointed
his
finger
to
the
*NL*
lighted
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
there
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Bazin
?
''
asked
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
watched
the
window
,
he
guarded
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
Athos
.
``
You
are
good
and
faithful
servants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
sprang
from
his
horse
,
gave
the
bridle
to
Grimaud
,
and
advanced
*NL*
toward
the
window
,
after
having
made
a
sign
to
the
rest
of
the
troop
to
*NL*
go
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
house
was
surrounded
by
a
low
,
quickset
hedge
,
two
or
three
*NL*
feet
high
.
Athos
sprang
over
the
hedge
and
went
up
to
the
window
,
which
*NL*
was
without
shutters
,
but
had
the
half-curtains
closely
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
the
skirting
stone
that
his
eyes
might
look
over
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
light
of
a
lamp
he
saw
a
woman
,
wrapped
in
a
dark
mantle
,
seated
*NL*
upon
a
stool
near
a
dying
fire
.
Her
elbows
were
placed
upon
a
mean
*NL*
table
,
and
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
two
hands
,
which
were
white
as
*NL*
ivory
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
distinguish
her
countenance
,
but
a
sinister
smile
passed
*NL*
over
the
lips
of
Athos
.
He
was
not
deceived
;
it
was
she
whom
he
sought
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
horse
neighed
.
Milady
raised
her
head
,
saw
close
to
the
*NL*
panes
the
pale
face
of
Athos
,
and
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
perceiving
that
she
knew
him
,
pushed
the
window
with
his
knee
and
*NL*
hand
.
The
window
yielded
.
The
squares
were
broken
to
shivers
;
and
Athos
,
*NL*
like
the
spectre
of
vengeance
,
leaped
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
rushed
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
More
pale
and
menacing
than
*NL*
Athos
,
d'Artagnan
stood
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
recoiled
,
uttering
a
cry
.
D'Artagnan
,
believing
she
might
have
*NL*
means
of
flight
and
fearing
she
should
escape
,
drew
a
pistol
from
his
*NL*
belt
;
but
Athos
raised
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
back
that
weapon
,
d'Artagnan
!
''
said
he
;
``
this
woman
must
be
tried
,
*NL*
not
assassinated
.
Wait
an
instant
,
my
friend
,
and
you
shall
be
*NL*
satisfied
.
Come
in
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
obeyed
;
for
Athos
had
the
solemn
voice
and
the
powerful
*NL*
gesture
of
a
judge
sent
by
the
Lord
himself
.
Behind
d'Artagnan
entered
*NL*
Porthos
,
Aramis
,
Lord
de
Winter
,
and
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
lackeys
guarded
the
door
and
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
had
sunk
into
a
chair
,
with
her
hands
extended
,
as
if
to
conjure
*NL*
this
terrible
apparition
.
Perceiving
her
brother-in-law
,
she
uttered
a
*NL*
terrible
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
screamed
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
want
,
''
said
Athos
,
``
Charlotte
Backson
,
who
first
was
called
Comtesse
*NL*
de
la
Fere
,
and
afterwards
Milady
de
Winter

Baroness
of
Sheffield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
I
!
that
is
I

''
murmured
Milady
,
in
extreme
terror
;
``
what
do
you
*NL*
want

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wish
to
judge
you
according

Athos
;
``
you

Justify
yourself

M.
d'Artagnan

*NL*
it
is
for
you
to
accuse

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
God
and
before
men

''
said
he
,
``
I
accuse
this
woman

poisoned

*NL*
He
turned
towards
Porthos
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
bear
witness
to
this
,
''
said
the
two
Musketeers
,
with
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
continued
:
``
Before
God

I

she
sent
me
from
Villeroy

*NL*
with
a
forged
letter

as
if
that
wine
came
from
my
friends

God

preserved

a
man
named
Brisemont
died
in
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
bear

said
Porthos

,
in
the

manner
*NL*
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

as
no
one
else
can
attest
the
*NL*
truth

this
accusation

I
attest
it
myself

I
have
done

''
And
*NL*
d'Artagnan
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
with
Porthos
and
Aramis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
turn
,
my
Lord

said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baron
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
God
and
before
men
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
accuse
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

cried
all
present
,
with
one
*NL*
voice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
the
baron
,
``

On
receiving

had
this

her
in
charge
to
a

loyal
servant

She
corrupted
this
man
;
she
placed
the
poniard
in
his

hand

she
made
him
kill

And
at

perhaps

Felton

fury

*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
crept
through
the
judges
at
the
revelation
of
these
unknown
*NL*
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
all

resumed
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
My

*NL*
*NL*
``
Horror

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
And
Lord
de
Winter
ranged
himself
by
the
side
of
d'Artagnan
,
leaving
the
*NL*
place
free
for
another
accuser

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
let
her
head
sink
between
her
two
hands
,
and
tried
to
recall
her
*NL*
ideas
,
whirling
in
a
mortal
vertigo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
turn
,
''
said
Athos
,
himself
trembling
as
the
lion
trembles
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
serpent
--
``
my
turn

I
married
that

I
gave

my
wealth

I
gave

my

one
day
I
discovered
that
*NL*
this
woman
was
branded
--
this

was
marked
with
a
FLEUR-DE-LIS
on
her
*NL*
left
shoulder

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Milady
,
raising
herself
,
``
I
defy
you

find
any
tribunal

I

*NL*
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

said
a
hollow
voice

``
It
is
for
me
to
reply

And
the
*NL*
man
in
the
red
cloak
came
forward
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
is
that

What
man
is
that

cried
Milady
,
suffocated
by
*NL*
terror
,
her
hair
loosening
itself
,
and
rising
above
her
livid
*NL*
countenance
as
if
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
turned
towards
this
man
--
for
to
all
except
Athos
he
was
*NL*
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Athos
looked
at
him
with
as
much
stupefaction
as
the
others
,
for
he
*NL*
knew
not
how
he
could
in
any
way
find
himself
mixed
up
with
the
horrible
*NL*
drama
then
unfolded
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
approaching
Milady
with
a
slow
and
solemn
step
,
so
that
the
table
*NL*
alone
separated
them
,
the
unknown
took
off
his
mask
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
for
some
time
examined
with
increasing
terror
that
pale
face
,
*NL*
framed
with
black
hair
and
whiskers
,
the
only
expression
of
which
was
*NL*
icy
impassibility
.
Then
she
suddenly
cried
,
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
!
''
rising
and
*NL*
retreating
to
the
very
wall
.
``
No

no

it
is
an
infernal
apparition
!
It
*NL*
is
not
he

Help

screamed
she
,
turning
towards
the
wall
,
as
if
*NL*
she
would
tear
an
opening
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you

then

cried
all
the
witnesses
of
this
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
that
woman

said
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
,
``
for
you
may
plainly
*NL*
see
she
knows
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
executioner

cried
Milady
,
a
*NL*
prey
to
insensate
terror
,
and
clinging
with
her
hands
to
the
wall
to
*NL*
avoid
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
drew
back
,
and
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
remained
standing
*NL*
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

grace

grace

pardon

''
cried
the
wretch
,
falling
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unknown
waited
for
silence
,
and
then
resumed
,
``
I
told
you
well
that
*NL*
she
would
know
me

Yes

I
am
the
executioner

this

my

history

*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
fixed
upon
this
man

whose
words
were
listened
to
with
*NL*
anxious
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
woman
was
once
a
young

as
beautiful
as
she
is
today

She
was
*NL*
a
nun
in
the
convent
of
the
Benedictines
of
Templemar
.
A
young
priest
,
*NL*
with
a
simple
and
trustful
heart
,
performed
the
duties
of
the
church
of
*NL*
that
convent
.
She
undertook
his
seduction
,
and
succeeded
;
she
would
have
*NL*
seduced
a
saint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
vows
were
sacred
and
irrevocable
.
Their
connection
could
not
last
*NL*
long
without
ruining
both
.
She
prevailed
upon
him
to
leave
the
country
;
*NL*
but
to
leave
the
country
,
to
fly
together
,
to
reach
another
part
of
*NL*
France
,
where
they
might
live
at
ease
because
unknown
,
money
was
*NL*
necessary
.
Neither
had
any

The
priest
stole
the
sacred
vases
,
and
sold
*NL*
them
;
but
as
they
were
preparing
to
escape
together
,
they
were
both
*NL*
arrested

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
days
later
she
had
seduced
the
son

the
jailer

escaped

*NL*
The
young
priest
was
condemned
to
ten
years
of
imprisonment
,
and
to
be
*NL*
branded

I
was
executioner
of
the
city
of
Lille

as
this
woman
has
said

*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
brand
the
guilty
one

he

gentlemen
,
was
my
*NL*
brother

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
then
swore

this

had
ruined
him
,
who
was
more
than
his
*NL*
accomplice
,
since
she
had
urged
him
to
the
crime
,
should
at
least
share
*NL*
his
punishment
.
I
suspected
where
she
was
concealed
.
I
followed
her
,
I
*NL*
caught
her
,
I
bound
her
;
and
I
imprinted
the

disgraceful
mark
upon

her
that
I

imprinted
upon
my
poor

*NL*
``
The
day
after

my

succeeded
in

making
his
escape

I
was
accused
of
complicity
,
and
was
condemned
to
*NL*
remain
in
his
place
till
he
should
be
again
a
prisoner
.
My
poor
brother
*NL*
was
ignorant
of
this
sentence

He
rejoined
this
woman
;
they
fled
*NL*
together
into
Berry
,
and
there
he
obtained
a
little
curacy
.
This
woman
*NL*
passed
for
his
sister

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord

became
enamoured
of
her

amorous
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
that
he
proposed
to
marry
her

Then
she
quitted
him

him

surrendered

hanged
himself
that

night
from

iron
bar
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

the

in
a
hollow

*NL*
*NL*
Milady
uttered
a
frightful
shriek
,
and
dragged
herself
along
several
*NL*
paces
upon
her
knees
toward
her
judges

*NL*
*NL*
Athos
stretched
out
his

*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
,
which
left
no
hope

Milady
raised
herself
in
all
her
*NL*
pride
,
and
wished
to
speak
;
but
her
strength
failed
her
.
She
felt
that
a

powerful

implacable
hand
seized
her
by
the
hair
,
and
dragged
her
*NL*
away
as
irrevocably

She
did
not

even

The

followed

solitary

66
EXECUTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
midnight
;
the
moon
,
lessened
by
its
decline
,
and
reddened
by
*NL*
the
last
traces
of
the
storm
,
arose
behind
the
little
town
of
*NL*
Armentieres
,
which
showed
against
its
pale
light
the
dark
outline
of
its
*NL*
houses
,
and
the
skeleton
of
its
high
belfry
.
In
front
of
them
the
Lys
*NL*
rolled
its
waters
like
a
river
of
molten
tin
;
while
on
the
other
side
*NL*
was
a
black
mass
of
trees
,
profiled
on
a
stormy
sky
,
invaded
by
large
*NL*
coppery
clouds
which
created
a
sort
of
twilight
amid
the
night
.
On
the
*NL*
left
was
an
old
abandoned
mill
,
with
its
motionless
wings
,
from
the
*NL*
ruins
of
which
an
owl
threw
out
its
shrill
,
periodical
,
and
monotonous
*NL*
cry
.
On
the
right
and
on
the
left
of
the
road
,
which
the
dismal
*NL*
procession
pursued
,
appeared
a
few
low
,
stunted
trees
,
which
looked
like
*NL*
deformed
dwarfs
crouching
down
to
watch
men
traveling
at
this
sinister
*NL*
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
a
broad
sheet
of
lightning
opened
the
horizon
in
its
*NL*
whole
width
,
darted
like
a
serpent
over
the
black
mass
of
trees
,
and
*NL*
like
a
terrible
scimitar
divided
the
heavens
and
the
waters
into
two
*NL*
parts
.
Not
a
breath
of
wind
now
disturbed
the
heavy
atmosphere
.
A
*NL*
deathlike
silence
oppressed
all
nature
.
The
soil
was
humid
and
*NL*
glittering
with
the
rain
which
had
recently
fallen
,
and
the
refreshed
*NL*
herbs
sent
forth
their
perfume
with
additional
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
lackeys
dragged
Milady
,
whom
each
held
by
one
arm
.
The
executioner
*NL*
walked
behind
them
,
and
Lord
de
Winter
,
d'Artagnan
,
Porthos
,
and
Aramis
*NL*
walked
behind
the
executioner
.
Planchet
and
Bazin
came
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
lackeys
conducted
Milady
to
the
bank
of
the
river
.
Her
mouth
was
*NL*
mute
;
but
her
eyes
spoke
with
their
inexpressible
eloquence
,
*NL*
supplicating
by
turns
each
of
those
on
whom
she
looked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
a
few
paces
in
advance
she
whispered
to
the
lackeys
,
``
A
thousand
*NL*
pistoles
to
each
of
you
,
if
you
will
assist
my
escape
;
but
if
you
*NL*
deliver
me
up
to
your
masters
,
I
have
near
at
hand
avengers
who
will
*NL*
make
you
pay
dearly
for
my
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
hesitated
.
Mousqueton
trembled
in
all
his
members
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
,
who
heard
Milady
's
voice
,
came
sharply
up
.
Lord
de
Winter
did
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Change
these
lackeys
,
''
said
he
;
``
she
has
spoken
to
them
.
They
are
no
*NL*
longer
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Planchet
and
Bazin
were
called
,
and
took
the
places
of
Grimaud
and
*NL*
Mousqueton
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
bank
of
the
river
the
executioner
approached
Milady
,
and
bound
*NL*
her
hands
and
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
broke
the
silence
to
cry
out
,
``
You
are
cowards
,
miserable
*NL*
assassins
--
ten
men
combined
to
murder
one
woman
.
Beware
!
If
I
am
not
*NL*
saved
I
shall
be
avenged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
a
woman
,
''
said
Athos
,
coldly
and
sternly
.
``
You
do
not
*NL*
belong
to
the
human
species
;
you
are
a
demon
escaped
from
hell
,
whither
*NL*
we
send
you
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
virtuous
men
!
''
said
Milady
;
``
please
to
remember
that
he
who
*NL*
shall
touch
a
hair
of
my
head
is
himself
an
assassin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
executioner
may
kill
,
without
being
on
that
account
an
assassin
,
''
*NL*
said
the
man
in
the
red
cloak
,
rapping
upon
his
immense
sword
.
``
This
is
*NL*
the
last
judge
;
that
is
all
.
NACHRICHTER
,
as
say
our
neighbors
,
the
*NL*
Germans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
bound
her
while
saying
these
words
,
Milady
uttered
two
or
*NL*
three
savage
cries
,
which
produced
a
strange
and
melancholy
effect
in
*NL*
flying
away
into
the
night
,
and
losing
themselves
in
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
guilty
,
if
I
have
committed
the
crimes
you
accuse
me
of
,
''
*NL*
shrieked
Milady
,
``
take
me
before
a
tribunal
.
You
are
not
judges
!
You
*NL*
can
not
condemn
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
offered
you
Tyburn
,
''
said
Lord
de
Winter
.
``
Why
did
you
not
accept
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
not
willing
to
die
!
''
cried
Milady
,
struggling
.
``
Because
I
*NL*
am
too
young
to
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
woman
you
poisoned
at
Bethune
was
still
younger
than
you
,
madame
,
*NL*
and
yet
she
is
dead
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
enter
a
cloister
;
I
will
become
a
nun
,
''
said
Milady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
in
a
cloister
,
''
said
the
executioner
,
``
and
you
left
it
to
ruin
*NL*
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
and
sank
upon
her
knees
.
The
executioner
*NL*
took
her
up
in
his
arms
and
was
carrying
her
toward
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
cried
she
,
``
my
God
!
are
you
going
to
drown
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
cries
had
something
so
heartrending
in
them
that
M.
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
who
had
been
at
first
the
most
eager
in
pursuit
of
Milady
,
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
hung
his
head
,
covering
his
ears
with
the
palms
*NL*
of
his
hands
;
and
yet
,
notwithstanding
,
he
could
still
hear
her
cry
and
*NL*
threaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
was
the
youngest
of
all
these
men
.
His
heart
failed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
not
behold
this
frightful
spectacle
!
''
said
he
.
``
I
can
not
*NL*
consent
that
this
woman
should
die
thus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
heard
these
few
words
and
caught
at
a
shadow
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
d'Artagnan
,
d'Artagnan
!
''
cried
she
;
``
remember
that
I
loved
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
rose
and
took
a
step
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Athos
rose
likewise
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
placed
himself
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
take
one
step
farther
,
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
shall
cross
*NL*
swords
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
sank
on
his
knees
and
prayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
continued
Athos
,
``
executioner
,
do
your
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Willingly
,
monseigneur

said
the
executioner
;
``
for
as
I
am
a
good
*NL*
Catholic

I
firmly
believe
I
am
acting
justly

on
this
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well

*NL*
*NL*
Athos
made
a
step
toward
Milady

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pardon

said
he
,
``
the
ill

done

by
the
despair

you
have
cast
me

Die
in

*NL*
*NL*
Lord
de
Winter
advanced
in
his
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pardon
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
the
poisoning
of
my
brother

and
the
*NL*
assassination

Lord
Buckingham

I
pardon
you
for
the
death

of
poor
Felton

I
pardon
you
for

attempts
upon

person

Die
in

peace

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,

said
M.
d'Artagnan
.
``
Pardon

in

pardon

you
the
murder

poor
love

your
cruel
vengeance
against

I
*NL*
pardon

and
I
weep
for

Die

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lost
!
''
murmured
Milady
in
English
.
``
I
must
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
arose
of
herself
,
and
cast
around
her
one
of
those
piercing
*NL*
looks
which
seemed
to
dart
from
an
eye
of
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
nothing
;
she
listened
,
and
she
heard
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
to
die
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
other
bank
,
''
replied
the
executioner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
placed
her
in
the
boat
,
and
as
he
was
going
to
set
foot
in
it
*NL*
himself
,
Athos
handed
him
a
sum
of
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
the
price
of
the
execution
,
that
it
may
be
plain
we
*NL*
act
as
judges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
correct
,
''
said
the
executioner
;
``
and
now
in
her
turn
,
let
this
*NL*
woman
see
that
I
am
not
fulfilling
my
trade
,
but
my
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
threw
the
money
into
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
moved
off
toward
the
left-hand
shore
of
the
Lys
,
bearing
the
*NL*
guilty
woman
and
the
executioner
;
all
the
others
remained
on
the
*NL*
right-hand
bank
,
where
they
fell
on
their
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
glided
along
the
ferry
rope
under
the
shadow
of
a
pale
cloud
*NL*
which
hung
over
the
water
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troop
of
friends
saw
it
gain
the
opposite
bank
;
the
figures
were
*NL*
defined
like
black
shadows
on
the
red-tinted
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Milady
,
during
the
passage
had
contrived
to
untie
the
cord
which
*NL*
fastened
her
feet
.
On
coming
near
the
bank
,
she
jumped
lightly
on
shore
*NL*
and
took
to
flight
.
But
the
soil
was
moist
;
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
*NL*
bank
,
she
slipped
and
fell
upon
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
struck
,
no
doubt
,
with
a
superstitious
idea
;
she
conceived
that
*NL*
heaven
denied
its
aid
,
and
she
remained
in
the
attitude
in
which
she
had
*NL*
fallen
,
her
head
drooping
and
her
hands
clasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
saw
from
the
other
bank
the
executioner
raise
both
his
arms
*NL*
slowly
;
a
moonbeam
fell
upon
the
blade
of
the
large
sword
.
The
two
arms
*NL*
fell
with
a
sudden
force
;
they
heard
the
hissing
of
the
scimitar
and
the
*NL*
cry
of
the
victim
,
then
a
truncated
mass
sank
beneath
the
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
executioner
then
took
off
his
red
cloak
,
spread
it
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
laid
the
body
in
it
,
threw
in
the
head
,
tied
all
up
by
the
four
corners
,
*NL*
lifted
it
on
his
back
,
and
entered
the
boat
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
stream
he
stopped
the
boat
,
and
suspending
his
*NL*
burden
over
the
water
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Let
the
justice
of
God
be
*NL*
done
!
''
and
he
let
the
corpse
drop
into
the
depths
of
the
waters
,
which
*NL*
closed
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
afterward
the
four
Musketeers
were
in
Paris
;
they
had
not
*NL*
exceeded
their
leave
of
absence
,
and
that
same
evening
they
went
to
pay
*NL*
their
customary
visit
to
M.
de
Treville
.

CONCLUSION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
sixth
of
the
following
month
the
king
,
in
compliance
with
the
*NL*
promise
he
had
made
the
cardinal
to
return
to
La
Rochelle
,
left
his
*NL*
capital
still
in
amazement
at
the
news
which
began
to
spread
itself
of
*NL*
Buckingham
's
assassination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
warned
that
the
man
she
had
loved
so
much
was
in
great
danger
,
*NL*
the
queen
,
when
his
death
was
announced
to
her
,
would
not
believe
the
*NL*
fact
,
and
even
imprudently
exclaimed
,
``
it
is
false
;
he
has
just
written
*NL*
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
next
day
she
was
obliged
to
believe
this
fatal
intelligence
;
*NL*
Laporte
,
detained
in
England
,
as
everyone
else
had
been
,
by
the
orders
*NL*
of
Charles
I
,
arrived
,
and
was
the
bearer
of
the
duke
's
dying
gift
to
*NL*
the
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
joy
of
the
king
was
lively
.
He
did
not
even
give
himself
the
trouble
*NL*
to
dissemble
,
and
displayed
it
with
affectation
before
the
queen
.
Louis
*NL*
XIII
,
like
every
weak
mind
,
was
wanting
in
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
king
soon
again
became
dull
and
indisposed
;
his
brow
was
not
one
*NL*
of
those
that
long
remain
clear
.
He
felt
that
in
returning
to
camp
he
*NL*
should
re-enter
slavery
;
nevertheless
,
he
did
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
was
for
him
the
fascinating
serpent
,
and
himself
the
bird
*NL*
which
flies
from
branch
to
branch
without
power
to
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
return
to
La
Rochelle
,
therefore
,
was
profoundly
dull
.
Our
four
*NL*
friends
,
in
particular
,
astonished
their
comrades
;
they
traveled
*NL*
together
,
side
by
side
,
with
sad
eyes
and
heads
lowered
.
Athos
alone
*NL*
from
time
to
time
raised
his
expansive
brow
;
a
flash
kindled
in
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
bitter
smile
passed
over
his
lips
,
then
,
like
his
comrades
,
*NL*
he
sank
again
into
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
escort
arrived
in
a
city
,
when
they
had
conducted
the
*NL*
king
to
his
quarters
the
four
friends
either
retired
to
their
own
or
to
*NL*
some
secluded
cabaret
,
where
they
neither
drank
nor
played
;
they
only
*NL*
conversed
in
a
low
voice
,
looking
around
attentively
to
see
that
no
one
*NL*
overheard
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
the
king
had
halted
to
fly
the
magpie
,
and
the
four
*NL*
friends
,
according
to
their
custom
,
instead
of
following
the
sport
had
*NL*
stopped
at
a
cabaret
on
the
high
road
,
a
man
coming
from
la
Rochelle
on
*NL*
horseback
pulled
up
at
the
door
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
darted
a
*NL*
searching
glance
into
the
room
where
the
four
Musketeers
were
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holloa
,
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
!
''
said
he
,
``
is
not
that
you
whom
I
see
*NL*
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
raised
his
head
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
.
It
was
the
man
he
*NL*
called
his
phantom
;
it
was
his
stranger
of
Meung
,
of
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Fossoyeurs
and
of
Arras
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
drew
his
sword
,
and
sprang
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
,
instead
of
avoiding
him
the
stranger
jumped
from
his
*NL*
horse
,
and
advanced
to
meet
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
!
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
I
meet
you
,
then
,
at
last
!
This
*NL*
time
you
shall
not
escape
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
is
it
my
intention
,
monsieur
,
for
this
time
I
was
seeking
you
;
*NL*
in
the
name
of
the
king
,
I
arrest
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
what
do
you
say
?
''
cried
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
you
must
surrender
your
sword
to
me
,
monsieur
,
and
that
*NL*
without
resistance
.
This
concerns
your
head
,
I
warn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
then
?
''
demanded
d'Artagnan
,
lowering
the
point
of
his
*NL*
sword
,
but
without
yet
surrendering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
Chevalier
de
Rochefort
,
''
answered
the
other
,
``
the
equerry
of
*NL*
Monsieur
le
Cardinal
Richelieu
,
and
I
have
orders
to
conduct
you
to
his
*NL*
Eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
returning
to
his
Eminence
,
monsieur
the
Chevalier
,
''
said
Athos
,
*NL*
advancing
;
``
and
you
will
please
to
accept
the
word
of
Monsieur
*NL*
d'Artagnan
that
he
will
go
straight
to
La
Rochelle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
place
him
in
the
hands
of
guards
who
will
take
him
into
camp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
be
his
guards
,
monsieur
,
upon
our
word
as
gentlemen
;
but
*NL*
likewise
,
upon
our
word
as
gentlemen
,
''
added
Athos
,
knitting
his
brow
,
*NL*
``
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
shall
not
leave
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Chevalier
de
Rochefort
cast
a
glance
backward
,
and
saw
that
Porthos
*NL*
and
Aramis
had
placed
themselves
between
him
and
the
gate
;
he
understood
*NL*
that
he
was
completely
at
the
mercy
of
these
four
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
will
surrender
his
sword
*NL*
to
me
and
join
his
word
to
yours
,
I
shall
be
satisfied
with
your
promise
*NL*
to
convey
Monsieur
d'Artagnan
to
the
quarters
of
Monseigneur
the
*NL*
Cardinal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
my
word
,
monsieur
,
and
here
is
my
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
suits
me
the
better
,
''
said
Rochefort
,
``
as
I
wish
to
continue
my
*NL*
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
rejoining
Milady
,
''
said
Athos
,
coolly
,
``
it
*NL*
is
useless
;
you
will
not
find
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
her
,
then
?
''
asked
Rochefort
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Return
to
camp
and
you
shall
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rochefort
remained
for
a
moment
in
thought
;
then
,
as
they
were
only
a
*NL*
day
's
journey
from
Surgeres
,
whither
the
cardinal
was
to
come
to
meet
*NL*
the
king
,
he
resolved
to
follow
the
advice
of
Athos
and
go
with
them
.
*NL*
Besides
,
this
return
offered
him
the
advantage
of
watching
his
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
resumed
their
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
they
arrived
at
*NL*
Surgeres
.
The
cardinal
there
awaited
Louis
XIII
.
The
minister
and
the
*NL*
king
exchanged
numerous
caresses
,
felicitating
each
other
upon
the
*NL*
fortunate
chance
which
had
freed
France
from
the
inveterate
enemy
who
*NL*
set
all
Europe
against
her
.
After
which
,
the
cardinal
,
who
had
been
*NL*
informed
that
d'Artagnan
was
arrested
and
who
was
anxious
to
see
him
,
*NL*
took
leave
of
the
king
,
inviting
him
to
come
the
next
day
to
view
the
*NL*
work
already
done
upon
the
dyke
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
in
the
evening
to
his
quarters
at
the
bridge
of
La
Pierre
,
*NL*
the
cardinal
found
,
standing
before
the
house
he
occupied
,
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
without
his
sword
,
and
the
three
Musketeers
armed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
as
he
was
well
attended
,
he
looked
at
them
sternly
,
and
made
*NL*
a
sign
with
his
eye
and
hand
for
d'Artagnan
to
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
wait
for
you
,
d'Artagnan
,
''
said
Athos
,
loud
enough
for
the
*NL*
cardinal
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Eminence
bent
his
brow
,
stopped
for
an
instant
,
and
then
kept
on
his
*NL*
way
without
uttering
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
entered
after
the
cardinal
,
and
behind
d'Artagnan
the
door
*NL*
was
guarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Eminence
entered
the
chamber
which
served
him
as
a
study
,
and
made
a
*NL*
sign
to
Rochefort
to
bring
in
the
young
Musketeer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rochefort
obeyed
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
remained
alone
in
front
of
the
cardinal
;
this
was
his
second
*NL*
interview
with
Richelieu
,
and
he
afterward
confessed
that
he
felt
well
*NL*
assured
it
would
be
his
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
remained
standing
,
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
;
a
table
*NL*
was
between
him
and
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
you
have
been
arrested
by
my
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
tell
me
,
monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
monseigneur
,
for
the
only
thing
for
which
I
could
be
arrested
is
*NL*
still
unknown
to
your
Eminence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
looked
steadfastly
at
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holloa
!
''
said
he
,
``
what
does
that
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Monseigneur
will
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
,
in
the
first
place
,
*NL*
what
crimes
are
imputed
to
me
,
I
will
then
tell
him
the
deeds
I
have
*NL*
really
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crimes
are
imputed
to
you
which
had
brought
down
far
loftier
heads
than
*NL*
yours
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
monseigneur
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
with
a
calmness
which
astonished
*NL*
the
cardinal
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
charged
with
having
corresponded
with
the
enemies
of
the
*NL*
kingdom
;
you
are
charged
with
having
surprised
state
secrets
;
you
are
*NL*
charged
with
having
tried
to
thwart
the
plans
of
your
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
charges
me
with
this
,
monseigneur
?
''
said
d'Artagnan
,
who
had
no
*NL*
doubt
the
accusation
came
from
Milady
,
``
a
woman
branded
by
the
justice
*NL*
of
the
country
;
a
woman
who
has
espoused
one
man
in
France
and
another
*NL*
in
England
;
a
woman
who
poisoned
her
second
husband
and
who
attempted
*NL*
both
to
poison
and
assassinate
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
monsieur
?
''
cried
the
cardinal
,
astonished
;
``
and
of
*NL*
what
woman
are
you
speaking
thus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Milady
de
Winter
,
''
replied
d'Artagnan
,
``
yes
,
of
Milady
de
Winter
,
of
*NL*
whose
crimes
your
Eminence
is
doubtless
ignorant
,
since
you
have
honored
*NL*
her
with
your
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
if
Milady
de
Winter
has
committed
the
*NL*
crimes
you
lay
to
her
charge
,
she
shall
be
punished

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
punished

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
has
punished
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

in
prison

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dead

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead

repeated
the
cardinal
,
who
could
not
believe
what
he
heard
,
*NL*
``
dead
!
Did
you
not
say
she
was
dead
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
times
she
attempted
to
kill
me
,
and
I
pardoned
her
;
but
she
*NL*
murdered
the
woman
I
loved
.
Then
my
friends
and
I
took
her
,
tried
her
,
*NL*
and
condemned
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
then
related
the
poisoning
of
Mme.
Bonacieux
in
the
convent
*NL*
of
the
Carmelites
at
Bethune
,
the
trial
in
the
isolated
house
,
and
the
*NL*
execution
on
the
banks
of
the
Lys
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
shudder
crept
through
the
body
of
the
cardinal
,
who
did
not
shudder
*NL*
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
at
once
,
as
if
undergoing
the
influence
of
an
unspoken
thought
,
*NL*
the
countenance
of
the
cardinal
,
till
then
gloomy
,
cleared
up
by
*NL*
degrees
,
and
recovered
perfect
serenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
in
a
tone
that
contrasted
strongly
with
the
*NL*
severity
of
his
words
,
``
you
have
constituted
yourselves
judges
,
without
*NL*
remembering
that
they
who
punish
without
license
to
punish
are
*NL*
assassins
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
I
swear
to
you
that
I
never
for
an
instant
had
the
*NL*
intention
of
defending
my
head
against
you
.
I
willingly
submit
to
any
*NL*
punishment
your
Eminence
may
please
to
inflict
upon
me
.
I
do
not
hold
*NL*
life
dear
enough
to
be
afraid
of
death

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
you
are
a
man
of
a
stout
heart
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
with
a
voice
almost
affectionate
;
``
I
can
therefore
tell
you
*NL*
beforehand
you
shall
be
tried
,
and
even
condemned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
might
reply
to
your
Eminence
that
he
had
his
pardon
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
I
content
myself
with
saying
:
Command
,
monseigneur
;
I
am
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
pardon
?
''
said
Richelieu
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
monseigneur
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
signed
by
whom
--
by
the
king
?
''
And
the
cardinal
pronounced
these
*NL*
words
with
a
singular
expression
of
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
your
Eminence

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
me
?
You
are
insane
,
monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
will
doubtless
recognize
his
own
handwriting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
d'Artagnan
presented
to
the
cardinal
the
precious
piece
of
paper
*NL*
which
Athos
had
forced
from
Milady
,
and
which
he
had
given
to
d'Artagnan
*NL*
to
serve
him
as
a
safeguard
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Eminence
took
the
paper
,
and
read
in
a
slow
voice

dwelling
upon

every
syllable
:

``
Dec.

,
1627
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
by
my
order
and
for
the
good
of

state
that
the
bearer
of
this
*NL*

done
what
he
has
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
RICHELIEU
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
,
after
having
read
these
two
lines
,
sank
into
a
profound
*NL*
reverie
;
but
he
did
not
return
the
paper
to
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
meditating
by
what
sort
of
punishment
he
shall
cause
me
to
die
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Gascon
to
himself
.
``
Well
,
my
faith
!
he
shall
see
how
a
*NL*
gentleman
can
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Musketeer
was
in
excellent
disposition
to
die
heroically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
still
continued
thinking
,
rolling
and
unrolling
the
paper
in
*NL*
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
raised
his
head
,
fixed
his
eagle
look
upon
that
loyal
,
*NL*
open
,
and
intelligent
countenance
,
read
upon
that
face
,
furrowed
with
*NL*
tears
,
all
the
sufferings
its
possessor
had
endured
in
the
course
of
a
*NL*
month
,
and
reflected
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
how
much
there
was
in
*NL*
that
youth
of
twenty-one
years
before
him
,
and
what
resources
his
*NL*
activity
,
his
courage
,
and
his
shrewdness
might
offer
to
a
good
master
.
*NL*
On
the
other
side
,
the
crimes
,
the
power
,
and
the
infernal
genius
of
*NL*
Milady
had
more
than
once
terrified
him
.
He
felt
something
like
a
secret
*NL*
joy
at
being
forever
relieved
of
this
dangerous
accomplice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Richelieu
slowly
tore
the
paper
which
d'Artagnan
had
generously
*NL*
relinquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
lost
!
''
said
d'Artagnan
to
himself
.
And
he
bowed
profoundly
before
*NL*
the
cardinal
,
like
a
man
who
says
,
``
Lord
,
Thy
will
be
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
approached
the
table
,
and
without
sitting
down
,
wrote
a
few
*NL*
lines
upon
a
parchment
of
which
two-thirds
were
already
filled
,
and
*NL*
affixed
his
seal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
condemnation
,
''
thought
d'Artagnan
;
``
he
will
spare
me
the
*NL*
ENNUI
of
the
Bastille
,
or
the
tediousness
of
a
trial
.
That
's
very
kind
*NL*
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
cardinal
to
the
young
man
.
``
I
have
taken
from
*NL*
you
one
CARTE
BLANCHE
to
give
you
another

The

is
wanting

*NL*
commission

you
can
write
it
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
the
paper
hesitatingly
and
cast
his
eyes
over
it
;
it
was
*NL*
a
lieutenant
's
commission
in
the
Musketeers
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
life
is
yours

henceforth
dispose
of
it

But
*NL*
this
favor
which
you
bestow
upon
me
I
do
not
merit
.
I
have
three
friends
*NL*
who
are
more
meritorious
and
more
worthy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
brave
youth

d'Artagnan
,
''
interrupted
the
cardinal
,
tapping
*NL*
him
familiarly
on
the
shoulder
,
charmed
at
having
vanquished
this
*NL*
rebellious
nature
.
``
Do
with
this
commission
what
you
will
;
only
*NL*
remember
,
though
the
name
be
blank

it

you
I
give
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forget
it

''
replied
d'Artagnan
.
``
Your
Eminence
may
be
*NL*
certain
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
turned
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Rochefort
!
''
The
*NL*
chevalier
,
who
no
doubt
was
near
the
door
,
entered
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rochefort
,
''
said
the
cardinal
,
``
you
see
Monsieur
d'Artagnan

I
receive
*NL*
him
among
the
number

my

Greet
each

then
;
and
be
wise
*NL*
if
you
wish
to
preserve
your
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rochefort
and
d'Artagnan
coolly
greeted
each
other
with
their
lips
;
but
*NL*
the
cardinal
was
there
,
observing
them
with
his
vigilant
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
the
chamber
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
meet
again
,
shall
we
not
,
monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
please

''
said
d'Artagnan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
opportunity
will
come

replied
Rochefort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey

''
said
the
cardinal
,
opening
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
smiled
at
each
other
,
shook
hands
,
and
saluted
his
Eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
beginning
to
grow
impatient

said
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am

replied
d'Artagnan
;
``
not
only
free

in

favor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

about

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
evening

but
for
the
moment

let
us
separate

''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
that
same
evening
d'Artagnan
repaired
to
the
quarters
of
*NL*
Athos
,
whom
he
found
in
a
fair
way
to
empty
a
bottle
of
Spanish
wine
--
an
*NL*
occupation
which
he
religiously
accomplished
every
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
what
had
taken
place
between
the
cardinal
and
*NL*
himself
,
and
drawing
the
commission
from
his
pocket
,
said
,
``
Here
,
my
*NL*
dear
Athos
,
this
naturally
belongs
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
smiled
with
one
of
his
sweet
and
expressive
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friend
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
Athos
this
is
too
much
;
for
the
Comte
de
la
Fere
*NL*
it
is
too
little
.
Keep
the
commission
;
it
is
yours
.
Alas
!
you
have
*NL*
purchased
it
dearly
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
left
Athos
's
chamber
and
went
to
that
of
Porthos
.
He
found
*NL*
him
clothed
in
a
magnificent
dress
covered
with
splendid
embroidery
,
*NL*
admiring
himself
before
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
!
is
that
you
,
dear
friend
?
''
exclaimed
Porthos
.
``
How
do
you
think
*NL*
these
garments
fit
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderfully
,
''
said
d'Artagnan
;
``
but
I
come
to
offer
you
a
dress
which
*NL*
will
become
you
still
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Porthos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
of
a
lieutenant
of
Musketeers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
related
to
Porthos
the
substance
of
his
interview
with
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
and
said
,
taking
the
commission
from
his
pocket
,
``
Here
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
write
your
name
upon
it
and
become
my
chief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Porthos
cast
his
eyes
over
the
commission
and
returned
it
to
d'Artagnan
,
*NL*
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
yes
,
that
would
flatter
me
very
much
;
but
I
should
not
*NL*
have
time
enough
to
enjoy
the
distinction
.
During
our
expedition
to
*NL*
Bethune
the
husband
of
my
duchess
died
;
so
,
my
dear
,
the
coffer
of
the
*NL*
defunct
holding
out
its
arms
to
me
,
I
shall
marry
the
widow
.
Look
here
!
*NL*
I
was
trying
on
my
wedding
suit
.
Keep
the
lieutenancy
,
my
dear
,
keep
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
then
entered
the
apartment
of
Aramis
.
He
found
him
*NL*
kneeling
before
a
PRIEDIEU
with
his
head
leaning
on
an
open
prayer
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
described
to
him
his
interview
with
the
cardinal
,
and
said
,
for
the
*NL*
third
time
drawing
his
commission
from
his
pocket
,
``
You
,
our
friend
,
our
*NL*
intelligence
,
our
invisible
protector

accept
this
commission

You
have

merited
it
more
than
any
of
us
by
your
wisdom

your
counsels
,
always
*NL*
followed
by
such
happy
results

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
dear
friend
!
''
said
Aramis
,
``
our
late
adventures
have
disgusted
me
*NL*
with
military
life

This
time
my
determination
is
irrevocably
taken

After
the
siege
I
shall
enter
the
house
of
the
Lazarists
.
Keep
the
*NL*
commission

the
profession
of
arms
suits
you

You
will
be
a
*NL*
brave
and
adventurous
captain

''
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
,
his
eye
moist
with
gratitude
though
beaming
with
joy
,
went
*NL*
back
to
Athos
,
whom
he
found
still
at
table
contemplating
the
charms
of
*NL*
his
last
glass
of
Malaga
by
the
light
of
his
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
they
likewise
have
refused
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
dear
friend
,
is
because
nobody
is
more
worthy
than
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
quill
,
wrote
the
name
of
d'Artagnan
in
the
commission
,
and
*NL*
returned
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
then
have
no
more
friends

''
said
the
young
man
.
``
Alas
!
nothing
*NL*
but
bitter
recollections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
let
his
head
sink
upon
his
hands
,
while
two
large
tears
rolled
*NL*
down
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
young

replied
Athos
;

your
bitter
recollections

change
themselves
into

La
Rochelle
,
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
the
English
fleet
and
of
the
*NL*
diversion
promised
by
Buckingham
,
surrendered
after
a
siege
of
a
year
.
*NL*
On
the
twenty-eighth
of
October
,
1628
,
the
capitulation
was
signed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
made
his
entrance
into
Paris
on
the
twenty-third
of
December
of
*NL*
the
same
year
.
He
was
received
in
triumph
,
as
if
he
came
from
conquering
*NL*
an
enemy
and
not
Frenchmen
.
He
entered
by
the
Faubourg
St.
Jacques
,
*NL*
under
verdant
arches
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
took
possession
of
his
command
.
Porthos
left
the
service
,
and
*NL*
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
married
Mme.
Coquenard
;
the
coffer
*NL*
so
much
coveted
contained
eight
hundred
thousand
livres
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mousqueton
had
a
magnificent
livery
,
and
enjoyed
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
which
he
had
been
ambitious
all
his
life
--
that
of
standing
behind
a
*NL*
gilded
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aramis
,
after
a
journey
into
Lorraine
,
disappeared
all
at
once
,
and
*NL*
ceased
to
write
to
his
friends
;
they
learned
at
a
later
period
through
*NL*
Mme.
de
Chevreuse
,
who
told
it
to
two
or
three
of
her
intimates
,
that
,
*NL*
yielding
to
his
vocation
,
he
had
retired
into
a
convent
--
only
into
*NL*
which
,
nobody
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bazin
became
a
lay
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athos
remained
a
Musketeer
under
the
command
of
d'Artagnan
till
the
year
*NL*
1633
,
at
which
period
,
after
a
journey
he
made
to
Touraine
,
he
also
quit
*NL*
the
service
,
under
the
pretext
of
having
inherited
a
small
property
in
*NL*
Roussillon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grimaud
followed
Athos
.
*NL*
*NL*
D'Artagnan
fought
three
times
with
Rochefort

wounded
him
three
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
probably
kill
you
the
fourth

said
he
to
him
,
holding
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
assist
him
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
much
better
both
for
you

for
me
to
stop
where
we
are

answered
the
wounded
man
.
``
CORBLEU

I
am
more
your

after

very
first
encounter

I
could
by
saying
a
word
to
*NL*
the
cardinal
have
had
your
throat
cut

*NL*

They
this
time
embraced
heartily

without
retaining
any
malice

*NL*
Planchet
obtained
from
Rochefort
the
rank
of
sergeant
in
the
Piedmont
*NL*
regiment

*NL*
*NL*
M
Bonacieux
lived
on
very
quietly
,
wholly
ignorant
of
what
had
become
of
*NL*
his
wife
,
and
caring
very
little
about
it
.
One
day
he
had
the
imprudence
*NL*
to
recall
himself
to
the
memory
of
the
cardinal
.
The
cardinal
had
him
*NL*
informed
that
he
would
provide
for
him
so
that
he
should
never
want
for
*NL*
anything
in
future

In
fact
,
M.
Bonacieux
,
having
left
his
house
at
*NL*
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
to
go
to
the
Louvre
,
never
appeared
again
*NL*
in
the
Rue
des
Fossoyeurs
;
the
opinion
of
those
who
seemed
to
be
best
*NL*
informed
was
that
he
was
fed
and
lodged
in
some
royal
castle
,
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
his
generous
Eminence
