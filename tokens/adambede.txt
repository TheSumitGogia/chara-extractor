Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
Workshop
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
single
drop
of
ink
for
a
mirror
,
the
Egyptian
sorcerer
undertakes
*NL*
to
reveal
to
any
chance
comer
far-reaching
visions
of
the
past
.
This
is
*NL*
what
I
undertake
to
do
for
you
,
reader
.
With
this
drop
of
ink
at
the
*NL*
end
of
my
pen
,
I
will
show
you
the
roomy
workshop
of
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
,
*NL*
carpenter
and
builder
,
in
the
village
of
Hayslope
,
as
it
appeared
on
the
*NL*
eighteenth
of
June
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1799
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
sun
was
warm
on
the
five
workmen
there
,
busy
upon
doors
*NL*
and
window-frames
and
wainscoting
.
A
scent
of
pine-wood
from
a
tentlike
*NL*
pile
of
planks
outside
the
open
door
mingled
itself
with
the
scent
of
*NL*
the
elder-bushes
which
were
spreading
their
summer
snow
close
to
*NL*
the
open
window
opposite
;
the
slanting
sunbeams
shone
through
the
*NL*
transparent
shavings
that
flew
before
the
steady
plane
,
and
lit
up
the
*NL*
fine
grain
of
the
oak
panelling
which
stood
propped
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
On
a
heap
of
those
soft
shavings
a
rough
,
grey
shepherd
dog
had
*NL*
made
himself
a
pleasant
bed
,
and
was
lying
with
his
nose
between
his
*NL*
fore-paws
,
occasionally
wrinkling
his
brows
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
*NL*
tallest
of
the
five
workmen
,
who
was
carving
a
shield
in
the
centre
of
*NL*
a
wooden
mantelpiece
.
It
was
to
this
workman
that
the
strong
barytone
*NL*
belonged
which
was
heard
above
the
sound
of
plane
and
hammer
singing
--
*NL*
*NL*
Awake
,
my
soul
,
and
with
the
sun
*NL*
Thy
daily
stage
of
duty
run
;
*NL*
Shake
off
dull
sloth
...
*NL*
*NL*
Here
some
measurement
was
to
be
taken
which
required
more
concentrated
*NL*
attention
,
and
the
sonorous
voice
subsided
into
a
low
whistle
;
but
it
*NL*
presently
broke
out
again
with
renewed
vigour
--
*NL*
*NL*
Let
all
thy
converse
be
sincere
,
*NL*
Thy
conscience
as
the
noonday
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
voice
could
only
come
from
a
broad
chest
,
and
the
broad
chest
*NL*
belonged
to
a
large-boned
,
muscular
man
nearly
six
feet
high
,
with
a
*NL*
back
so
flat
and
a
head
so
well
poised
that
when
he
drew
himself
up
*NL*
to
take
a
more
distant
survey
of
his
work
,
he
had
the
air
of
a
soldier
*NL*
standing
at
ease
.
The
sleeve
rolled
up
above
the
elbow
showed
an
arm
*NL*
that
was
likely
to
win
the
prize
for
feats
of
strength
;
yet
the
long
*NL*
supple
hand
,
with
its
broad
finger-tips
,
looked
ready
for
works
of
*NL*
skill
.
In
his
tall
stalwartness
Adam
Bede
was
a
Saxon
,
and
justified
his
*NL*
name
;
but
the
jet-black
hair
,
made
the
more
noticeable
by
its
contrast
*NL*
with
the
light
paper
cap
,
and
the
keen
glance
of
the
dark
eyes
that
*NL*
shone
from
under
strongly
marked
,
prominent
and
mobile
eyebrows
,
*NL*
indicated
a
mixture
of
Celtic
blood
.
The
face
was
large
and
roughly
*NL*
hewn
,
and
when
in
repose
had
no
other
beauty
than
such
as
belongs
to
an
*NL*
expression
of
good-humoured
honest
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
clear
at
a
glance
that
the
next
workman
is
Adam
's
brother
.
He
is
*NL*
nearly
as
tall
;
he
has
the
same
type
of
features
,
the
same
hue
of
hair
*NL*
and
complexion
;
but
the
strength
of
the
family
likeness
seems
only
to
*NL*
render
more
conspicuous
the
remarkable
difference
of
expression
both
in
*NL*
form
and
face
.
Seth
's
broad
shoulders
have
a
slight
stoop
;
his
eyes
*NL*
are
grey
;
his
eyebrows
have
less
prominence
and
more
repose
than
his
*NL*
brother
's
;
and
his
glance
,
instead
of
being
keen
,
is
confiding
and
*NL*
benign
.
He
has
thrown
off
his
paper
cap
,
and
you
see
that
his
hair
is
*NL*
not
thick
and
straight
,
like
Adam
's
,
but
thin
and
wavy
,
allowing
you
*NL*
to
discern
the
exact
contour
of
a
coronal
arch
that
predominates
very
*NL*
decidedly
over
the
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idle
tramps
always
felt
sure
they
could
get
a
copper
from
Seth
;
they
*NL*
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
concert
of
the
tools
and
Adam
's
voice
was
at
last
broken
by
Seth
,
*NL*
who
,
lifting
the
door
at
which
he
had
been
working
intently
,
placed
*NL*
it
against
the
wall
,
and
said
,
``
There
!
I
've
finished
my
door
to-day
,
*NL*
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
workmen
all
looked
up
;
Jim
Salt
,
a
burly
,
red-haired
man
known
as
*NL*
Sandy
Jim
,
paused
from
his
planing
,
and
Adam
said
to
Seth
,
with
a
sharp
*NL*
glance
of
surprise
,
``
What
!
Dost
think
thee
`
st
finished
the
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
sure
,
''
said
Seth
,
with
answering
surprise
;
``
what
's
awanting
to
`
t
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
loud
roar
of
laughter
from
the
other
three
workmen
made
Seth
look
*NL*
round
confusedly
.
Adam
did
not
join
in
the
laughter
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
slight
smile
on
his
face
as
he
said
,
in
a
gentler
tone
than
before
,
*NL*
``
Why
,
thee
`
st
forgot
the
panels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
laughter
burst
out
afresh
as
Seth
clapped
his
hands
to
his
head
,
and
*NL*
coloured
over
brow
and
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoorray
!
''
shouted
a
small
lithe
fellow
called
Wiry
Ben
,
running
forward
*NL*
and
seizing
the
door
.
``
We
'll
hang
up
th
'
door
at
fur
end
o
'
th
'
shop
an
'
*NL*

Methody

hould
*NL*

red
pot

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Adam
.
``
Let
it
alone
,
Ben
Cranage
.
You
'll
mayhap
be
*NL*
making
such
a
slip
yourself
some
day
;
you
'll
laugh
o
'
th
'
other
side
o
'
*NL*
your
mouth
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catch
me
at
it
,
Adam
.
It
'll
be
a
good
while
afore
my
head
's
full
o
'
th
'
*NL*
Methodies
,
''
said
Ben
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
it
's
often
full
o
'
drink
,
and
that
's
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
,
however
,
had
now
got
the
``
red
pot
''
in
his
hand
,
and
was
about
*NL*
to
begin
writing
his
inscription
,
making
,
by
way
of
preliminary
,
an
*NL*
imaginary
S
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
alone
,
will
you
?
''
Adam
called
out
,
laying
down
his
tools
,
*NL*
striding
up
to
Ben
,
and
seizing
his
right
shoulder
.
``
Let
it
alone
,
or
*NL*
I
'll
shake
the
soul
out
o
'
your
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
shook
in
Adam
's
iron
grasp
,
but
,
like
a
plucky
small
man
as
he
was
,
*NL*
he
did
n't
mean
to
give
in
.
With
his
left
hand
he
snatched
the
brush
from
*NL*
his
powerless
right
,
and
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
perform
the
feat
*NL*
of
writing
with
his
left
.
In
a
moment
Adam
turned
him
round
,
seized
his
*NL*
other
shoulder
,
and
,
pushing
him
along
,
pinned
him
against
the
wall
.
But
*NL*
now
Seth
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
be
,
Addy
,
let
be
.
Ben
will
be
joking
.
Why
,
he
's
i
'
the
right
to
*NL*
laugh
at
me
--
I
canna
help
laughing
at
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
loose
him
till
he
promises
to
let
the
door
alone
,
''
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Ben
,
lad
,
''
said
Seth
,
in
a
persuasive
tone
,
``
do
n't
let
's
have
a
*NL*
quarrel
about
it
.
You
know
Adam
will
have
his
way
.
You
may
's
well
try
*NL*
to
turn
a
waggon
in
a
narrow
lane
.
Say
you
'll
leave
the
door
alone
,
and
*NL*
make
an
end
o
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
binna
frighted
at
Adam
,
''
said
Ben
,
``
but
I
donna
mind
sayin

as
I
'll

let

alone

Seth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
wise
of
you
,
Ben
,
''
said
Adam
,
laughing
and
relaxing
his
*NL*
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
returned
to
their
work
now
;
but
Wiry
Ben
,
having
had
the
worst
*NL*
in
the
bodily
contest
,
was
bent
on
retrieving
that
humiliation
by
a
*NL*
success
in
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
was
ye
thinkin
'
on
,
Seth
,
''
he
began
--
``
the
pretty
parson
's
face
or
*NL*
her
sarmunt
,
when
ye
forgot
the
panels
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
hear
her
,
Ben
,
''
said
Seth
,
good-humouredly
;
``
she
's
going
to
*NL*
preach
on
the
Green
to-night

happen
ye
'd
get
something
to

*NL*
yourself
then
,
instead
o

those
wicked
songs

so
fond
on

*NL*
*NL*
``

about

rather
sternly

Nay

that
's
all

it

be
better
if

their
consciences
`
ud
let
'em
stay
quiet
i

the
church

there
's
a
deal
*NL*
to
be
learnt
there

And
there
's
such
a
thing
as
being
oversperitial
;
we
*NL*
must
have
something
beside
Gospel
i

this
world

th

's

an

th

coal-pit
engines

Cromford
;
a

must
learn
summat
beside
Gospel
to
make
them
things

I

reckon

hear
some
o

preachers

you
'd
think
as
a
man
must
be
*NL*
doing
nothing
all
's
life

shutting
's
eyes
and
looking
what
's
agoing
*NL*
on
inside
him
.
I
know
a
man
must
have
the
love
o
'
God
in
his
soul
,
and
*NL*
the
Bible
's
God
's
word
.
But
what
does
the
Bible
say
?
Why
,
it
says
as
God
*NL*
put
his
sperrit
into
the
workman
as
built
the
tabernacle
,
to
make
him
do
*NL*
all
the
carved
work
and
things
as
wanted
a
nice
hand
.
And
this
is
my
*NL*
way
o
'
looking
at
it
:
there
's
the
sperrit
o
'
God
in
all
things
and
all
*NL*
times
--
weekday
as
well
as
Sunday
--
and
i
'
the
great
works
and
inventions
,
*NL*
and
i
'
the
figuring
and
the
mechanics
.
And
God
helps
us
with
our
*NL*
headpieces
and
our
hands
as
well
as
with
our
souls
;
and
if
a
man
does
*NL*
bits
o
'
jobs
out
o
'
working
hours
--
builds
a
oven
for
's
wife
to
save
her
*NL*
from
going
to
the
bakehouse
,
or
scrats
at
his
bit
o
'
garden
and
makes
*NL*
two
potatoes
grow
istead
o
'
one
,
he
's
doin
'
more
good
,
and
he
's
just
as
*NL*
near
to
God
,
as
if
he
was
running
after
some
preacher
and
a-praying
and
*NL*
a-groaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done

Adam

''
said
Sandy
Jim
,
who
had
paused
from
his
planing
to
*NL*
shift
his
planks
while
Adam
was
speaking
;
``

's
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

gravely

It

the

*NL*
``

taking

against

*NL*
*NL*
All
hands
worked
on
in
silence
for
some
minutes
,
until
the
church
clock
*NL*
began
to
strike
six
.
Before
the
first
stroke
had
died
away
,
Sandy
Jim
*NL*
had
loosed
his
plane
and
was
reaching
his
jacket
;
Wiry
Ben
had
left
a
*NL*
screw
half
driven
in
,
and
thrown
his
screwdriver
into
his
tool-basket
;
*NL*
Mum
Taft
,
who
,
true
to
his
name
,
had
kept
silence
throughout
the
*NL*
previous
conversation
,
had
flung
down
his
hammer
as
he
was
in
the
act
*NL*
of
lifting
it
;
and
Seth
,
too
,
had
straightened
his
back
,
and
was
putting
*NL*
out
his
hand
towards
his
paper
cap
.
Adam
alone
had
gone
on
with
his
work
*NL*
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
But
observing
the
cessation
of
the
tools
,
he
*NL*
looked
up
,
and
said
,
in
a
tone
of
indignation
,
``
Look

now
!
I
ca
n't

to
see

the
minute
the

begins

as
if

took
no

their

*NL*
was
afraid
o

doing
a
stroke
too
much

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
looked
a
little
conscious
,
and
began
to
be
slower
in
his
*NL*
preparations
for
going
,
but
Mum
Taft
broke
silence
,
and
said
,
``

still
wrathful
;

*NL*
*NL*
With
this
exit
speech
,
which
he
considered
effective
,
Wiry
Ben
*NL*
shouldered
his
basket
and
left
the
workshop
,
quickly
followed
by
Mum
*NL*
Taft
and
Sandy
Jim
.
Seth
lingered
,
and
looked
wistfully
at
Adam
,
as
if
*NL*
he
expected
him
to
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shalt
go
home
before
thee
go
`
st
to
the
preaching
?
''
Adam
asked
,
looking
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
;
I
've
got
my
hat
and
things
at
Will
Maskery

I

I

if

There

`
st.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
tell
mother
not
to
look
for
thee
,
''
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
artna
going
to
Poyser
's
thyself
to-night
?
''
said
Seth
rather
*NL*
timidly
,
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
workshop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
'm
going
to
th
'
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
Gyp
had
kept
his
comfortable
bed
,
only
lifting
up
his
head
and
*NL*
watching
Adam
more
closely
as
he
noticed
the
other
workmen
departing
.
*NL*
But
no
sooner
did
Adam
put
his
ruler
in
his
pocket
,
and
begin
to
twist
*NL*
his
apron
round
his
waist
,
than
Gyp
ran
forward
and
looked
up
in
his
*NL*
master
's
face
with
patient
expectation
.
If
Gyp
had
had
a
tail
he
would
*NL*
doubtless
have
wagged
it
,
but
being
destitute
of
that
vehicle
for
his
*NL*
emotions
,
he
was
like
many
other
worthy
personages
,
destined
to
appear
*NL*
more
phlegmatic
than
nature
had
made
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Art
ready
for
the
basket
,
eh
,
Gyp
?
''
said
Adam
,
with
the
same
*NL*
gentle
modulation
of
voice
as
when
he
spoke
to
Seth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gyp
jumped
and
gave
a
short
bark
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Of
course
.
''
Poor
*NL*
fellow
,
he
had
not
a
great
range
of
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
basket
was
the
one
which
on
workdays
held
Adam
's
and
Seth
's
dinner
;
*NL*
and
no
official
,
walking
in
procession
,
could
look
more
resolutely
*NL*
unconscious
of
all
acquaintances
than
Gyp
with
his
basket
,
trotting
at
*NL*
his
master
's
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
workshop
Adam
locked
the
door
,
took
the
key
out
,
and
*NL*
carried
it
to
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
woodyard
.
It
was
a
*NL*
low
house
,
with
smooth
grey
thatch
and
buff
walls
,
looking
pleasant
*NL*
and
mellow
in
the
evening
light
.
The
leaded
windows
were
bright
and
*NL*
speckless
,
and
the
door-stone
was
as
clean
as
a
white
boulder
at
ebb
*NL*
tide
.
On
the
door-stone
stood
a
clean
old
woman
,
in
a
dark-striped
linen
*NL*
gown
,
a
red
kerchief
,
and
a
linen
cap
,
talking
to
some
speckled
fowls
*NL*
which
appeared
to
have
been
drawn
towards
her
by
an
illusory
expectation
*NL*
of
cold
potatoes
or
barley
.
The
old
woman
's
sight
seemed
to
be
dim
,
for
*NL*
she
did
not
recognize
Adam
till
he
said
,
``
Here
's
the
key
,
Dolly
;
lay
it
*NL*
down
for
me
in
the
house
,
will

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,

;
but
wunna

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Dolly
,
thank
you
;
I
'm
off
home
.
Good
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
hastened
with
long
strides
,
Gyp
close
to
his
heels
,
out
of
the
*NL*
workyard
,
and
along
the
highroad
leading
away
from
the
village
and
down
*NL*
to
the
valley
.
As
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
slope
,
an
elderly
horseman
,
*NL*
with
his
portmanteau
strapped
behind
him
,
stopped
his
horse
when
Adam
*NL*
had
passed
him
,
and
turned
round
to
have
another
long
look
at
the
*NL*
stalwart
workman
in
paper
cap
,
leather
breeches
,
and
dark-blue
worsted
*NL*
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
unconscious
of
the
admiration
he
was
exciting
,
presently
struck
*NL*
across
the
fields
,
and
now
broke
out
into
the
tune
which
had
all
day
*NL*
long
been
running
in
his
head
:
*NL*
*NL*
Let
all
thy
converse
be
sincere
,
*NL*
Thy
conscience
as
the
noonday
clear
;
*NL*
For
God
's
all-seeing
eye
surveys
*NL*
Thy
secret
thoughts
,
thy
works
and
ways
.

Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
Preaching
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
quarter
to
seven
there
was
an
unusual
appearance
of
excitement
*NL*
in
the
village
of
Hayslope
,
and
through
the
whole
length
of
its
*NL*
little
street
,
from
the
Donnithorne
Arms
to
the
churchyard
gate
,
the
*NL*
inhabitants
had
evidently
been
drawn
out
of
their
houses
by
something
*NL*
more
than
the
pleasure
of
lounging
in
the
evening
sunshine
.
The
*NL*
Donnithorne
Arms
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
village
,
and
a
small
*NL*
farmyard
and
stackyard
which
flanked
it
,
indicating
that
there
was
a
*NL*
pretty
take
of
land
attached
to
the
inn
,
gave
the
traveller
a
promise
*NL*
of
good
feed
for
himself
and
his
horse
,
which
might
well
console
him
*NL*
for
the
ignorance
in
which
the
weather-beaten
sign
left
him
as
to
the
*NL*
heraldic
bearings
of
that
ancient
family
,
the
Donnithornes
.
Mr.
Casson
,
*NL*
the
landlord
,
had
been
for
some
time
standing
at
the
door
with
his
hands
*NL*
in
his
pockets
,
balancing
himself
on
his
heels
and
toes
and
looking
*NL*
towards
a
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
,
with
a
maple
in
the
middle
of
it
,
*NL*
which
he
knew
to
be
the
destination
of
certain
grave-looking
men
and
*NL*
women
whom
he
had
observed
passing
at
intervals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Casson
's
person
was
by
no
means
of
that
common
type
which
can
be
*NL*
allowed
to
pass
without
description
.
On
a
front
view
it
appeared
to
*NL*
consist
principally
of
two
spheres
,
bearing
about
the
same
relation
to
*NL*
each
other
as
the
earth
and
the
moon
:
that
is
to
say
,
the
lower
sphere
*NL*
might
be
said
,
at
a
rough
guess
,
to
be
thirteen
times
larger
than
the
*NL*
upper
which
naturally
performed
the
function
of
a
mere
satellite
and
*NL*
tributary
.
But
here
the
resemblance
ceased
,
for
Mr.
Casson
's
head
was
*NL*
not
at
all
a
melancholy-looking
satellite
nor
was
it
a
``
spotty
globe
,
''
*NL*
as
Milton
has
irreverently
called
the
moon
;
on
the
contrary
,
no
head
and
*NL*
face
could
look
more
sleek
and
healthy
,
and
its
expression
--
which
was
*NL*
chiefly
confined
to
a
pair
of
round
and
ruddy
cheeks
,
the
slight
*NL*
knot
and
interruptions
forming
the
nose
and
eyes
being
scarcely
worth
*NL*
mention
--
was
one
of
jolly
contentment
,
only
tempered
by
that
sense
of
*NL*
personal
dignity
which
usually
made
itself
felt
in
his
attitude
and
*NL*
bearing
.
This
sense
of
dignity
could
hardly
be
considered
excessive
in
*NL*
a
man
who
had
been
butler
to
``
the
family
''
for
fifteen
years
,
and
who
,
in
*NL*
his
present
high
position
,
was
necessarily
very
much
in
contact
with
*NL*
his
inferiors
.
How
to
reconcile
his
dignity
with
the
satisfaction
of
his
*NL*
curiosity
by
walking
towards
the
Green
was
the
problem
that
Mr.
Casson
*NL*
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
for
the
last
five
minutes
;
but
when
*NL*
he
had
partly
solved
it
by
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
and
*NL*
thrusting
them
into
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
,
by
throwing
his
*NL*
head
on
one
side
,
and
providing
himself
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
*NL*
indifference
to
whatever
might
fall
under
his
notice
,
his
thoughts
were
*NL*
diverted
by
the
approach
of
the

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
put
his
horse
into
a
quick
walk
up
the
village
,
but
when
*NL*
he
approached
the
Green
,
the
beauty
of
the
view
that
lay
on
his
right
*NL*
hand
,
the
singular
contrast
presented
by
the
groups
of
villagers
with
*NL*
the
knot
of
Methodists
near
the
maple
,
and
perhaps
yet
more
,
curiosity
*NL*
to
see
the
young
female
preacher
,
proved
too
much
for
his
anxiety
to
get
*NL*
to
the
end
of
his
journey
,
and
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Green
lay
at
the
extremity
of
the
village
,
and
from
it
the
road
*NL*
branched
off
in
two
directions
,
one
leading
farther
up
the
hill
by
the
*NL*
church
,
and
the
other
winding
gently
down
towards
the
valley
.
On
the
*NL*
side
of
the
Green
that
led
towards
the
church
,
the
broken
line
of
*NL*
thatched
cottages
was
continued
nearly
to
the
churchyard
gate
;
but
on
*NL*
the
opposite
northwestern
side
,
there
was
nothing
to
obstruct
the
view
*NL*
of
gently
swelling
meadow
,
and
wooded
valley
,
and
dark
masses
of
distant
*NL*
hill
.
That
rich
undulating
district
of
Loamshire
to
which
Hayslope
*NL*
belonged
lies
close
to
a
grim
outskirt
of
Stonyshire
,
overlooked
by
its
*NL*
barren
hills
as
a
pretty
blooming
sister
may
sometimes
be
seen
linked
in
*NL*
the
arm
of
a
rugged
,
tall
,
swarthy
brother
;
and
in
two
or
three
hours
'
*NL*
ride
the
traveller
might
exchange
a
bleak
treeless
region
,
intersected
*NL*
by
lines
of
cold
grey
stone
,
for
one
where
his
road
wound
under
the
*NL*
shelter
of
woods
,
or
up
swelling
hills
,
muffled
with
hedgerows
and
long
*NL*
meadow-grass
and
thick
corn
;
and
where
at
every
turn
he
came
upon
some
*NL*
fine
old
country-seat
nestled
in
the
valley
or
crowning
the
slope
,
some
*NL*
homestead
with
its
long
length
of
barn
and
its
cluster
of
golden
ricks
,
*NL*
some
grey
steeple
looking
out
from
a
pretty
confusion
of
trees
and
*NL*
thatch
and
dark-red
tiles
.
It
was
just
such
a
picture
as
this
last
*NL*
that
Hayslope
Church
had
made
to
the
traveller
as
he
began
to
mount
the
*NL*
gentle
slope
leading
to
its
pleasant
uplands
,
and
now
from
his
station
*NL*
near
the
Green
he
had
before
him
in
one
view
nearly
all
the
other
*NL*
typical
features
of
this
pleasant
land
.
High
up
against
the
horizon
were
*NL*
the
huge
conical
masses
of
hill
,
like
giant
mounds
intended
to
fortify
*NL*
this
region
of
corn
and
grass
against
the
keen
and
hungry
winds
of
the
*NL*
north
;
not
distant
enough
to
be
clothed
in
purple
mystery
,
but
with
*NL*
sombre
greenish
sides
visibly
specked
with
sheep
,
whose
motion
was
only
*NL*
revealed
by
memory
,
not
detected
by
sight
;
wooed
from
day
to
day
by
the
*NL*
changing
hours
,
but
responding
with
no
change
in
themselves
--
left
for
*NL*
ever
grim
and
sullen
after
the
flush
of
morning
,
the
winged
gleams
of
*NL*
the
April
noonday
,
the
parting
crimson
glory
of
the
ripening
summer
*NL*
sun
.
And
directly
below
them
the
eye
rested
on
a
more
advanced
line
of
*NL*
hanging
woods
,
divided
by
bright
patches
of
pasture
or
furrowed
crops
,
*NL*
and
not
yet
deepened
into
the
uniform
leafy
curtains
of
high
summer
,
but
*NL*
still
showing
the
warm
tints
of
the
young
oak
and
the
tender
green
of
*NL*
the
ash
and
lime
.
Then
came
the
valley
,
where
the
woods
grew
thicker
,
*NL*
as
if
they
had
rolled
down
and
hurried
together
from
the
patches
left
*NL*
smooth
on
the
slope
,
that
they
might
take
the
better
care
of
the
tall
*NL*
mansion
which
lifted
its
parapets
and
sent
its
faint
blue
summer
smoke
*NL*
among
them
.
Doubtless
there
was
a
large
sweep
of
park
and
a
broad
glassy
*NL*
pool
in
front
of
that
mansion
,
but
the
swelling
slope
of
meadow
would
*NL*
not
let
our
traveller
see
them
from
the
village
green
.
He
saw
instead
*NL*
a
foreground
which
was
just
as
lovely
--
the
level
sunlight
lying
like
*NL*
transparent
gold
among
the
gently
curving
stems
of
the
feathered
grass
*NL*
and
the
tall
red
sorrel
,
and
the
white
ambels
of
the
hemlocks
lining
*NL*
the
bushy
hedgerows
.
It
was
that
moment
in
summer
when
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
scythe
being
whetted
makes
us
cast
more
lingering
looks
at
the
*NL*
flower-sprinkled
tresses
of
the
meadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
have
seen
other
beauties
in
the
landscape
if
he
had
turned
*NL*
a
little
in
his
saddle
and
looked
eastward
,
beyond
Jonathan
Burge
's
*NL*
pasture
and
woodyard
towards
the
green
corn-fields
and
walnut-trees
of
*NL*
the
Hall
Farm
;
but
apparently
there
was
more
interest
for
him
in
the
*NL*
living
groups
close
at
hand
.
Every
generation
in
the
village
was
there
,
*NL*
from
old
``
Feyther
Taft
''
in
his
brown
worsted
night-cap
,
who
was
bent
*NL*
nearly
double
,
but
seemed
tough
enough
to
keep
on
his
legs
a
long
while
,
*NL*
leaning
on
his
short
stick
,
down
to
the
babies
with
their
little
round
*NL*
heads
lolling
forward
in
quilted
linen
caps
.
Now
and
then
there
was
a
*NL*
new
arrival
;
perhaps
a
slouching
labourer
,
who
,
having
eaten
his
supper
,
*NL*
came
out
to
look
at
the
unusual
scene
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
willing
*NL*
to
hear
what
any
one
had
to
say
in
explanation
of
it
,
but
by
no
means
*NL*
excited
enough
to
ask
a
question
.
But
all
took
care
not
to
join
the
*NL*
Methodists
on
the
Green
,
and
identify
themselves
in
that
way
with
the
*NL*
expectant
audience
,
for
there
was
not
one
of
them
that
would
not
have
*NL*
disclaimed
the
imputation
of
having
come
out
to
hear
the
``
preacher
*NL*
woman
''
--
they
had
only
come
out
to
see
``
what
war
a-goin
'
on
,
like
.
''
The
*NL*
men
were
chiefly
gathered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
blacksmith
's
shop
.
*NL*
But
do
not
imagine
them
gathered
in
a
knot
.
Villagers
never
swarm
:
a
*NL*
whisper
is
unknown
among
them
,
and
they
seem
almost
as
incapable
of
an
*NL*
undertone
as
a
cow
or
a
stag
.
Your
true
rustic
turns
his
back
on
his
*NL*
interlocutor
,
throwing
a
question
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
meant
to
*NL*
run
away
from
the
answer
,
and
walking
a
step
or
two
farther
off
when
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
dialogue
culminates
.
So
the
group
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
blacksmith
's
door
was
by
no
means
a
close
one
,
and
formed
no
screen
in
*NL*
front
of
Chad
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
himself
,
who
stood
with
his
black
*NL*
brawny
arms
folded
,
leaning
against
the
door-post
,
and
occasionally
*NL*
sending
forth
a
bellowing
laugh
at
his
own
jokes
,
giving
them
a
*NL*
marked
preference
over
the
sarcasms
of
Wiry

who
had
renounced
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
the
Holly
Bush
for
the
sake
of
seeing
life
under
a
new
*NL*
form
.
But
both
styles
of
wit
were
treated
with
equal
contempt
by
Mr.
*NL*
Joshua
Rann
.
Mr.
Rann
's
leathern
apron
and
subdued
griminess
can
leave
*NL*
no
one
in
any
doubt
that
he
is
the
village
shoemaker
;
the
thrusting
out
*NL*
of
his
chin
and
stomach
and
the
twirling
of
his
thumbs
are
more
subtle
*NL*
indications
,
intended
to
prepare
unwary
strangers
for
the
discovery
that
*NL*
they
are
in
the
presence
of
the
parish
clerk
.
``
Old
Joshway
,
''
as
he
*NL*
is
irreverently
called
by
his
neighbours
,
is
in
a
state
of
simmering
*NL*
indignation
;
but
he
has
not
yet
opened
his
lips
except
to
say
,
in
a
*NL*
resounding
bass
undertone
,
like
the
tuning
of
a
violoncello
,
``
Sehon
,
*NL*
King
of
the
Amorites
;
for
His
mercy
endureth
for
ever
;
and
Og
the
King
*NL*
of
Basan
:
for
His
mercy
endureth
for
ever
''
--
a
quotation
which
may
seem
*NL*
to
have
slight
bearing
on
the
present
occasion
,
but
,
as
with
every
other
*NL*
anomaly
,
adequate
knowledge
will
show
it
to
be
a
natural
sequence
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rann
was
inwardly
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
Church
in
the
face
of
*NL*
this
scandalous
irruption
of
Methodism
,
and
as
that
dignity
was
bound
up
*NL*
with
his
own
sonorous
utterance
of
the
responses
,
his
argument
naturally
*NL*
suggested
a
quotation
from
the
psalm
he
had
read
the
last
Sunday
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stronger
curiosity
of
the
women
had
drawn
them
quite
to
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
Green
,
where
they
could
examine
more
closely
the
Quakerlike
costume
*NL*
and
odd
deportment
of
the
female
Methodists
.
Underneath
the
maple
there
*NL*
was
a
small
cart
,
which
had
been
brought
from
the
wheelwright
's
to
serve
*NL*
as
a
pulpit
,
and
round
this
a
couple
of
benches
and
a
few
chairs
had
*NL*
been
placed
.
Some
of
the
Methodists
were
resting
on
these
,
with
their
*NL*
eyes
closed
,
as
if
wrapt
in
prayer
or
meditation
.
Others
chose
to
*NL*
continue
standing
,
and
had
turned
their
faces
towards
the
villagers
*NL*
with
a
look
of
melancholy
compassion
,
which
was
highly
amusing
to
Bessy
*NL*
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
's
buxom
daughter
,
known
to
her
neighbours
as
*NL*
Chad
's
Bess
,
who
wondered
``
why
the
folks
war
amakin
'
faces
a
that
`
ns
.
''
*NL*
Chad
's
Bess
was
the
object
of
peculiar
compassion
,
because
her
hair
,
*NL*
being
turned
back
under
a
cap
which
was
set
at
the
top
of
her
head
,
*NL*
exposed
to
view
an
ornament
of
which
she
was
much
prouder
than
of
her
*NL*
red
cheeks
--
namely
,
a
pair
of
large
round
ear-rings
with
false
garnets
*NL*
in
them
,
ornaments
condemned
not
only
by
the
Methodists
,
but
by
her
own
*NL*
cousin
and
namesake
Timothy
's
Bess
,
who
,
with
much
cousinly
feeling
,
*NL*
often
wished
``
them
ear-rings
''
might
come
to
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Timothy
's
Bess
,
though
retaining
her
maiden
appellation
among
her
*NL*
familiars
,
had
long
been
the
wife
of
Sandy
Jim
,
and
possessed
a
handsome
*NL*
set
of
matronly
jewels
,
of
which
it
is
enough
to
mention
the
heavy
*NL*
baby
she
was
rocking
in
her
arms
,
and
the
sturdy
fellow
of
five
in
*NL*
knee-breeches
,
and
red
legs
,
who
had
a
rusty
milk-can
round
his
neck
by
*NL*
way
of
drum
,
and
was
very
carefully
avoided
by
Chad
's
small
terrier
.
*NL*
This
young
olive-branch
,
notorious
under
the
name
of
Timothy
's
Bess
's
*NL*
Ben
,
being
of
an
inquiring
disposition
,
unchecked
by
any
false
modesty
,
*NL*
had
advanced
beyond
the
group
of
women
and
children
,
and
was
walking
*NL*
round
the
Methodists
,
looking
up
in
their
faces
with
his
mouth
wide
*NL*
open
,
and
beating
his
stick
against
the
milk-can
by
way
of
musical
*NL*
accompaniment
.
But
one
of
the
elderly
women
bending
down
to
take
him
by
*NL*
the
shoulder
,
with
an
air
of
grave
remonstrance
,
Timothy
's
Bess
's
Ben
*NL*
first
kicked
out
vigorously
,
then
took
to
his
heels
and
sought
refuge
*NL*
behind
his
father
's
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye

''
said
Sandy
Jim
,
with
some
paternal
pride
,
``

he
continued
,
*NL*
as
that

sauntered
up
towards
the

of

*NL*
``

said
Mr.
Casson
,
*NL*
with
some
dignity
;
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

said
Mr.

.
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Ben
,
with
a
long
treble
intonation
,
``

*NL*
``

contemptuously

''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
of
the
men
followed
Ben
's
lead
,
and
the
traveller
pushed
his
*NL*
horse
on
to
the
Green
,
as
Dinah
walked
rather
quickly
and
in
advance
of
*NL*
her
companions
towards
the
cart
under
the
maple-tree
.
While
she
was
near
*NL*
Seth
's
tall
figure
,
she
looked
short
,
but
when
she
had
mounted
the
cart
,
*NL*
and
was
away
from
all
comparison
,
she
seemed
above
the
middle
height
of
*NL*
woman
,
though
in
reality
she
did
not
exceed
it
--
an
effect
which
was
due
*NL*
to
the
slimness
of
her
figure
and
the
simple
line
of
her
black
stuff
*NL*
dress
.
The
stranger
was
struck
with
surprise
as
he
saw
her
approach
and
*NL*
mount
the
cart
--
surprise
,
not
so
much
at
the
feminine
delicacy
of
*NL*
her
appearance
,
as
at
the
total
absence
of
self-consciousness
in
her
*NL*
demeanour
.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
her
advance
with
a
measured
*NL*
step
and
a
demure
solemnity
of
countenance
;
he
had
felt
sure
that
her
*NL*
face
would
be
mantled
with
the
smile
of
conscious
saintship
,
or
*NL*
else
charged
with
denunciatory
bitterness
.
He
knew
but
two
types
of
*NL*
Methodist
--
the
ecstatic
and
the
bilious
.
But
Dinah
walked
as
simply
as
*NL*
if
she
were
going
to
market
,
and
seemed
as
unconscious
of
her
outward
*NL*
appearance
as
a
little
boy
:
there
was
no
blush
,
no
tremulousness
,
which
*NL*
said
,
``
I
know
you
think
me
a
pretty
woman
,
too
young
to
preach
''
;
no
*NL*
casting
up
or
down
of
the
eyelids
,
no
compression
of
the
lips
,
no
*NL*
attitude
of
the
arms
that
said
,
``
But
you
must
think
of
me
as
a
saint
.
''
*NL*
She
held
no
book
in
her
ungloved
hands
,
but
let
them
hang
down
lightly
*NL*
crossed
before
her
,
as
she
stood
and
turned
her
grey
eyes
on
the
people
.
*NL*
There
was
no
keenness
in
the
eyes
;
they
seemed
rather
to
be
shedding
*NL*
love
than
making
observations
;
they
had
the
liquid
look
which
tells
that
*NL*
the
mind
is
full
of
what
it
has
to
give
out
,
rather
than
impressed
by
*NL*
external
objects
.
She
stood
with
her
left
hand
towards
the
descending
*NL*
sun
,
and
leafy
boughs
screened
her
from
its
rays
;
but
in
this
sober
*NL*
light
the
delicate
colouring
of
her
face
seemed
to
gather
a
calm
*NL*
vividness
,
like
flowers
at
evening
.
It
was
a
small
oval
face
,
of
a
*NL*
uniform
transparent
whiteness
,
with
an
egg-like
line
of
cheek
and
chin
,
*NL*
a
full
but
firm
mouth
,
a
delicate
nostril
,
and
a
low
perpendicular
brow
,
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
rising
arch
of
parting
between
smooth
locks
of
pale
*NL*
reddish
hair
.
The
hair
was
drawn
straight
back
behind
the
ears
,
and
*NL*
covered
,
except
for
an
inch
or
two
above
the
brow
,
by
a
net
Quaker
cap
.
*NL*
The
eyebrows
,
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hair
,
were
perfectly
horizontal
*NL*
and
firmly
pencilled
;
the
eyelashes
,
though
no
darker
,
were
long
and
*NL*
abundant
--
nothing
was
left
blurred
or
unfinished
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
faces
that
make
one
think
of
white
flowers
with
light
touches
of
colour
*NL*
on
their
pure
petals
.
The
eyes
had
no
peculiar
beauty
,
beyond
that
of
*NL*
expression
;
they
looked
so
simple
,
so
candid
,
so
gravely
loving
,
that
*NL*
no
accusing
scowl
,
no
light
sneer
could
help
melting
away
before
their
*NL*
glance
.
Joshua
Rann
gave
a
long
cough
,
as
if
he
were
clearing
his
throat
*NL*
in
order
to
come
to
a
new
understanding
with
himself
;
Chad
Cranage
*NL*
lifted
up
his
leather
skull-cap
and
scratched
his
head
;
and
Wiry
Ben
*NL*
wondered
how
Seth
had
the
pluck
to
think
of
courting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sweet
woman
,
''
the
stranger
said
to
himself
,
``
but
surely
nature
never
*NL*
meant
her
for
a
preacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
he
was
one
of
those
who
think
that
nature
has
theatrical
*NL*
properties
and
,
with
the
considerate
view
of
facilitating
art
and
*NL*
psychology
,
``
makes
up
,
''
her
characters
,
so
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
*NL*
about
them
.
But
Dinah
began
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friends
,
''
she
said
in
a
clear
but
not
loud
voice
``
let
us
pray
for
*NL*
a
blessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
her
eyes
,
and
hanging
her
head
down
a
little
continued
in
the
*NL*
same
moderate
tone
,
as
if
speaking
to
some
one
quite
near
her
:
``
Saviour
*NL*
of
sinners
!
When
a
poor
woman
laden
with
sins
,
went
out
to
the
well
to
*NL*
draw
water
,
she
found
Thee
sitting
at
the
well
.
She
knew
Thee
not
;
she
*NL*
had
not
sought
Thee
;
her
mind
was
dark
;
her
life
was
unholy
.
But
Thou
*NL*
didst
speak
to
her
,
Thou
didst
teach
her
,
Thou
didst
show
her
that
her
*NL*
life
lay
open
before
Thee
,
and
yet
Thou
wast
ready
to
give
her
that
*NL*
blessing
which
she
had
never
sought
.
Jesus
,
Thou
art
in
the
midst
of
us
,
*NL*
and
Thou
knowest
all
men
:
if
there
is
any
here
like
that
poor
woman
--
if
*NL*
their
minds
are
dark
,
their
lives
unholy
--
if
they
have
come
out
not
*NL*
seeking
Thee
,
not
desiring
to
be
taught
;
deal
with
them
according
to
the
*NL*
free
mercy
which
Thou
didst
show
to
her
.
Speak
to
them
,
Lord
,
open
their
*NL*
ears
to
my
message
,
bring
their
sins
to
their
minds
,
and
make
them
*NL*
thirst
for
that
salvation
which
Thou
art
ready
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
Thou
art
with
Thy
people
still
:
they
see
Thee
in

Thou
talkest
with

them
by
the

And
Thou
art
near
to
those
who

Thee

open
their
eyes
that
they
may
see
Thee

see
Thee
weeping
over
them
,
*NL*
and
saying
`
Ye
will
not
come
unto
me
that
ye
might
have
life

see
Thee
*NL*
hanging
on
the
cross
and
saying
,
`
Father
,
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
*NL*
not
what
they
do

see
Thee
as
Thou
wilt
come
again
in
Thy
glory
to
*NL*
judge
them
at
the
last

*NL*
Dinah
opened
her
eyes
again
and
paused
,
looking
at
the
group
of
*NL*
villagers
,
who
were
now
gathered
rather
more
closely
on
her
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friends
,
''
she
began
,
raising
her
voice
a
little
,
``
you
have
all
of
*NL*
you
been
to
church
,
and
I
think
you
must
have
heard
the
clergyman
*NL*
read
these
words
:
`
The
Spirit
of
the
Lord
is
upon
me
,
because
he
hath
*NL*
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
.
'
Jesus
Christ
spoke
those
*NL*
words
--
he
said
he
came
TO
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
TO
THE
POOR
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
you
ever
thought
about
those
words
much
,
but
I
will
tell
you
*NL*
when
I
remember
first
hearing
them
.
It
was
on
just
such
a
sort
of
*NL*
evening
as
this
,
when
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
my
aunt
as
brought
me
up
*NL*
took
me
to
hear
a
good
man
preach
out
of
doors
,
just
as
we
are
here
.
I
*NL*
remember
his
face
well
:
he
was
a
very
old
man
,
and
had
very
long
white
*NL*
hair
;
his
voice
was
very
soft
and
beautiful
,
not
like
any
voice
I
had
*NL*
ever
heard
before
.
I
was
a
little
girl
and
scarcely
knew
anything
,
and
*NL*
this
old
man
seemed
to
me
such
a
different
sort
of
a
man
from
anybody
*NL*
I
had
ever
seen
before
that
I
thought
he
had
perhaps
come
down
from
*NL*
the
sky
to
preach
to
us
,
and
I
said
,
`
Aunt
,
will
he
go
back
to
the
sky
*NL*
to-night
,
like
the
picture
in
the
Bible
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
of
God
was
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
spent
his
life
in
doing
what
our
*NL*
blessed
Lord
did
--
preaching
the
Gospel
to
the
poor
--
and
he
entered
into
*NL*
his
rest
eight
years
ago
.
I
came
to
know
more
about
him
years
after
,
but
*NL*
I
was
a
foolish
thoughtless
child
then
,
and
I
remembered
only
one
thing
*NL*
he
told
us
in
his
sermon
.
He
told
us
as
`
Gospel
'
meant
`
good
news
.
'
The
*NL*
Gospel
,
you
know
,
is
what
the
Bible
tells
us
about
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
that
now
!
Jesus
Christ
did
really
come
down
from
heaven
,
as
*NL*
I
,
like
a
silly
child
,
thought
Mr.
Wesley
did
;
and
what
he
came
down
*NL*
for
was
to
tell
good
news
about
God
to
the
poor
.
Why
,
you
and
me
,
dear
*NL*
friends
,
are
poor
.
We
have
been
brought
up
in
poor
cottages
and
have
*NL*
been
reared
on
oat-cake
,
and
lived
coarse
;
and
we
have
n't
been
to
school
*NL*
much
,
nor
read
books
,
and
we
do
n't
know
much
about
anything
but
what
*NL*
happens
just
round
us
.
We
are
just
the
sort
of
people
that
want
to
*NL*
hear
good
news
.
For
when
anybody
's
well
off
,
they
do
n't
much
mind
about
*NL*
hearing
news
from
distant
parts
;
but
if
a
poor
man
or
woman
's
in
trouble
*NL*
and
has
hard
work
to
make
out
a
living
,
they
like
to
have
a
letter
to
*NL*
tell
'em
they
've
got
a
friend
as
will
help
'em
.
To
be
sure
,
we
ca
n't
*NL*
help
knowing
something
about
God
,
even
if
we
've
never
heard
the
Gospel
,
*NL*
the
good
news
that
our
Saviour
brought
us
.
For
we
know
everything
comes
*NL*
from
God
:
do
n't
you
say
almost
every
day
,
`
This
and
that
will
happen
,
*NL*
please
God
,
'
and
`
We
shall
begin
to
cut
the
grass
soon
,
please
God
to
*NL*
send
us
a
little
more
sunshine
'
?
We
know
very
well
we
are
altogether
*NL*
in
the
hands
of
God
.
We
did
n't
bring
ourselves
into
the
world
,
we
ca
n't
*NL*
keep
ourselves
alive
while
we
're
sleeping
;
the
daylight
,
and
the
wind
,
*NL*
and
the
corn
,
and
the
cows
to
give
us
milk
--
everything
we
have
comes
*NL*
from
God
.
And
he
gave
us
our
souls
and
put
love
between
parents
and
*NL*
children
,
and
husband
and
wife
.
But
is
that
as
much
as
we
want
to
know
*NL*
about
God
?
We
see
he
is
great
and
mighty
,
and
can
do
what
he
will
:
we
*NL*
are
lost
,
as
if
we
was
struggling
in
great
waters
,
when
we
try
to
think
*NL*
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
doubts
come
into
your
mind
like
this
:
Can
God
take
much
*NL*
notice
of
us
poor
people
?
Perhaps
he
only
made
the
world
for
the
great
*NL*
and
the
wise
and
the
rich
.
It
does
n't
cost
him
much
to
give
us
our
*NL*
little
handful
of
victual
and
bit
of
clothing
;
but
how
do
we
know
he
*NL*
cares
for
us
any
more
than
we
care
for
the
worms
and
things
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
so
as
we
rear
our
carrots
and
onions
?
Will
God
take
care
of
us
*NL*
when
we
die
?
And
has
he
any
comfort
for
us
when
we
are
lame
and
sick
and
*NL*
helpless
?
Perhaps
,
too
,
he
is
angry
with
us
;
else
why
does
the
blight
*NL*
come
,
and
the
bad
harvests
,
and
the
fever
,
and
all
sorts
of
pain
and
*NL*
trouble
?
For
our
life
is
full
of
trouble
,
and
if
God
sends
us
good
,
he
*NL*
seems
to
send
bad
too
.
How
is
it
?
How
is
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
friends
,
we
are
in
sad
want
of
good
news
about
God
;
and
what
*NL*
does
other
good
news
signify
if
we
have
n't
that
?
For
everything
else
*NL*
comes
to
an
end
,
and
when
we
die
we
leave
it
all
.
But
God
lasts
when
*NL*
everything
else
is
gone
.
What
shall
we
do
if
he
is
not
our
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Dinah
told
how
the
good
news
had
been
brought
,
and
how
the
mind
*NL*
of
God
towards
the
poor
had
been
made
manifest
in
the
life
of
Jesus
,
*NL*
dwelling
on
its
lowliness
and
its
acts
of
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
see
,
dear
friends
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
Jesus
spent
his
time
almost
*NL*
all
in
doing
good
to
poor
people
;
he
preached
out
of
doors
to
them
,
and
*NL*
he
made
friends
of
poor
workmen
,
and
taught
them
and
took
pains
with
*NL*
them
.
Not
but
what
he
did
good
to
the
rich
too
,
for
he
was
full
of
love
*NL*
to
all
men
,
only
he
saw
as
the
poor
were
more
in
want
of
his
help
.
So
*NL*
he
cured
the
lame
and
the
sick
and
the
blind
,
and
he
worked
miracles
to
*NL*
feed
the
hungry
because
,
he
said
,
he
was
sorry
for
them
;
and
he
was
*NL*
very
kind
to
the
little
children
and
comforted
those
who
had
lost
their
*NL*
friends
;
and
he
spoke
very
tenderly
to
poor
sinners
that
were
sorry
for
*NL*
their
sins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
would
n't
you
love
such
a
man
if
you
saw
him
--
if
he
were
here
in
*NL*
this
village
?
What
a
kind
heart
he
must
have
!
What
a
friend
he
would
be
*NL*
to
go
to
in
trouble
!
How
pleasant
it
must
be
to
be
taught
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
friends
,
who
WAS
this
man
?
Was
he
only
a
good
man
--
a
very
*NL*
good
man
,
and
no
more
--
like
our
dear
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
has
been
taken
from
*NL*
us
?
...
He
was
the
Son
of
God
--
`
in
the
image
of
the
Father
,
'
the
Bible
*NL*
says
;
that
means
,
just
like
God
,
who
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
*NL*
things
--
the
God
we
want
to
know
about
.
So
then
,
all
the
love
that
*NL*
Jesus
showed
to
the
poor
is
the
same
love
that
God
has
for
us
.
We
can
*NL*
understand
what
Jesus
felt
,
because
he
came
in
a
body
like
ours
and
*NL*
spoke
words
such
as
we
speak
to
each
other
.
We
were
afraid
to
think
what
*NL*
God
was
before
--
the
God
who
made
the
world
and
the
sky
and
the
thunder
*NL*
and
lightning
.
We
could
never
see
him
;
we
could
only
see
the
things
he
*NL*
had
made
;
and
some
of
these
things
was
very
terrible
,
so
as
we
might
*NL*
well
tremble
when
we
thought
of
him
.
But
our
blessed
Saviour
has
showed
*NL*
us
what
God
is
in
a
way
us
poor
ignorant
people
can
understand
;
he
has
*NL*
showed
us
what
God
's
heart
is
,
what
are
his
feelings
towards
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
us
see
a
little
more
about
what
Jesus
came
on
earth
for
.
*NL*
Another
time
he
said
,
'
I
came
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost
'
;
*NL*
and
another
time
,
'
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
*NL*
repentance
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
LOST
!
...
SINNERS
!
...
Ah
,
dear
friends
,
does
that
mean
you
and
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
the
traveller
had
been
chained
to
the
spot
against
his
will
*NL*
by
the
charm
of
Dinah
's
mellow
treble
tones
,
which
had
a
variety
of
*NL*
modulation
like
that
of
a
fine
instrument
touched
with
the
unconscious
*NL*
skill
of
musical
instinct
.
The
simple
things
she
said
seemed
like
*NL*
novelties
,
as
a
melody
strikes
us
with
a
new
feeling
when
we
hear
*NL*
it
sung
by
the
pure
voice
of
a
boyish
chorister
;
the
quiet
depth
of
*NL*
conviction
with
which
she
spoke
seemed
in
itself
an
evidence
for
the
*NL*
truth
of
her
message
.
He
saw
that
she
had
thoroughly
arrested
her
*NL*
hearers
.
The
villagers
had
pressed
nearer
to
her
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
longer
anything
but
grave
attention
on
all
faces
.
She
spoke
slowly
,
*NL*
though
quite
fluently
,
often
pausing
after
a
question
,
or
before
any
*NL*
transition
of
ideas
.
There
was
no
change
of
attitude
,
no
gesture
;
the
*NL*
effect
of
her
speech
was
produced
entirely
by
the
inflections
of
her
*NL*
voice
,
and
when
she
came
to
the
question
,
``
Will
God
take
care
of
us
*NL*
when
we
die
?
''
she
uttered
it
in
such
a
tone
of
plaintive
appeal
that
*NL*
the
tears
came
into
some
of
the
hardest
eyes
.
The
stranger
had
ceased
*NL*
to
doubt
,
as
he
had
done
at
the
first
glance
,
that
she
could
fix
the
*NL*
attention
of
her
rougher
hearers
,
but
still
he
wondered
whether
she
*NL*
could
have
that
power
of
rousing
their
more
violent
emotions
,
which
*NL*
must
surely
be
a
necessary
seal
of
her
vocation
as
a
Methodist
preacher
,
*NL*
until
she
came
to
the
words
,
``
Lost
!
--
Sinners
!
''
when
there
was
a
great
*NL*
change
in
her
voice
and
manner
.
She
had
made
a
long
pause
before
the
*NL*
exclamation
,
and
the
pause
seemed
to
be
filled
by
agitating
thoughts
*NL*
that
showed
themselves
in
her
features
.
Her
pale
face
became
paler
;
*NL*
the
circles
under
her
eyes
deepened
,
as
they
did
when
tears
half-gather
*NL*
without
falling
;
and
the
mild
loving
eyes
took
an
expression
of
appalled
*NL*
pity
,
as
if
she
had
suddenly
discerned
a
destroying
angel
hovering
over
*NL*
the
heads
of
the
people
.
Her
voice
became
deep
and
muffled
,
but
there
*NL*
was
still
no
gesture
.
Nothing
could
be
less
like
the
ordinary
type
of
*NL*
the
Ranter
than
Dinah
.
She
was
not
preaching
as
she
heard
others
preach
,
*NL*
but
speaking
directly
from
her
own
emotions
and
under
the
inspiration
of
*NL*
her
own
simple
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
she
had
entered
into
a
new
current
of
feeling
.
Her
manner
became
*NL*
less
calm
,
her
utterance
more
rapid
and
agitated
,
as
she
tried
to
bring
*NL*
home
to
the
people
their
guilt
,
their
wilful
darkness
,
their
state
of
*NL*
disobedience
to
God
--
as
she
dwelt
on
the
hatefulness
of
sin
,
the
Divine
*NL*
holiness
,
and
the
sufferings
of
the
Saviour
,
by
which
a
way
had
been
*NL*
opened
for
their
salvation
.
At
last
it
seemed
as
if
,
in
her
yearning
*NL*
desire
to
reclaim
the
lost
sheep
,
she
could
not
be
satisfied
by
*NL*
addressing
her
hearers
as
a
body
.
She
appealed
first
to
one
and
then
to
*NL*
another
,
beseeching
them
with
tears
to
turn
to
God
while
there
was
*NL*
yet
time
;
painting
to
them
the
desolation
of
their
souls
,
lost
in
sin
,
*NL*
feeding
on
the
husks
of
this
miserable
world
,
far
away
from
God
their
*NL*
Father
;
and
then
the
love
of
the
Saviour
,
who
was
waiting
and
watching
*NL*
for
their
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
many
a
responsive
sigh
and
groan
from
her
fellow-Methodists
,
*NL*
but
the
village
mind
does
not
easily
take
fire
,
and
a
little
smouldering
*NL*
vague
anxiety
that
might
easily
die
out
again
was
the
utmost
effect
*NL*
Dinah
's
preaching
had
wrought
in
them
at
present
.
Yet
no
one
had
*NL*
retired
,
except
the
children
and
``
old
Feyther
Taft
,
''
who
being
too
deaf
*NL*
to
catch
many
words
,
had
some
time
ago
gone
back
to
his
inglenook
.
Wiry
*NL*
Ben
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
,
and
almost
wishing
he
had
not
come
*NL*
to
hear
Dinah
;
he
thought
what
she
said
would
haunt
him
somehow
.
Yet
he
*NL*
could
n't
help
liking
to
look
at
her
and
listen
to
her
,
though
he
dreaded
*NL*
every
moment
that
she
would
fix
her
eyes
on
him
and
address
him
in
*NL*
particular
.
She
had
already
addressed
Sandy
Jim
,
who
was
now
holding
the
*NL*
baby
to
relieve
his
wife
,
and
the
big
soft-hearted
man
had
rubbed
away
*NL*
some
tears
with
his
fist
,
with
a
confused
intention
of
being
a
better
*NL*
fellow
,
going
less
to
the
Holly
Bush
down
by
the
Stone-pits
,
and
*NL*
cleaning
himself
more
regularly
of
a
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
Sandy
Jim
stood
Chad
's
Bess
,
who
had
shown
an
unwonted
*NL*
quietude
and
fixity
of
attention
ever
since
Dinah
had
begun
to
speak
.
*NL*
Not
that
the
matter
of
the
discourse
had
arrested
her
at
once
,
for
she
*NL*
was
lost
in
a
puzzling
speculation
as
to
what
pleasure
and
satisfaction
*NL*
there
could
be
in
life
to
a
young
woman
who
wore
a
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
*NL*
Giving
up
this
inquiry
in
despair
,
she
took
to
studying
Dinah
's
nose
,
*NL*
eyes
,
mouth
,
and
hair
,
and
wondering
whether
it
was
better
to
have
such
*NL*
a
sort
of
pale
face
as
that
,
or
fat
red
cheeks
and
round
black
eyes
like
*NL*
her
own
.
But
gradually
the
influence
of
the
general
gravity
told
upon
*NL*
her
,
and
she
became
conscious
of
what
Dinah
was
saying
.
The
gentle
*NL*
tones
,
the
loving
persuasion
,
did
not
touch
her
,
but
when
the
more
*NL*
severe
appeals
came
she
began
to
be
frightened
.
Poor
Bessy
had
always
*NL*
been
considered
a
naughty
girl
;
she
was
conscious
of
it
;
if
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
be
very
good
,
it
was
clear
she
must
be
in
a
bad
way
.
She
*NL*
could
n't
find
her
places
at
church
as
Sally
Rann
could
,
she
had
often
*NL*
been
tittering
when
she
``
curcheyed
''
to
Mr.
Irwine
;
and
these
religious
*NL*
deficiencies
were
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
slackness
in
the
minor
*NL*
morals
,
for
Bessy
belonged
unquestionably
to
that
unsoaped
lazy
class
of
*NL*
feminine
characters
with
whom
you
may
venture
to
``
eat
an
egg
,
an
apple
,
*NL*
or
a
nut
.
''
All
this
she
was
generally
conscious
of
,
and
hitherto
had
not
*NL*
been
greatly
ashamed
of
it
.
But
now
she
began
to
feel
very
much
as
if
*NL*
the
constable
had
come
to
take
her
up
and
carry
her
before
the
justice
*NL*
for
some
undefined
offence
.
She
had
a
terrified
sense
that
God
,
whom
she
*NL*
had
always
thought
of
as
very
far
off
,
was
very
near
to
her
,
and
that
*NL*
Jesus
was
close
by
looking
at
her
,
though
she
could
not
see
him
.
For
*NL*
Dinah
had
that
belief
in
visible
manifestations
of
Jesus
,
which
is
*NL*
common
among
the
Methodists
,
and
she
communicated
it
irresistibly
to
her
*NL*
hearers
:
she
made
them
feel
that
he
was
among
them
bodily
,
and
might
at
*NL*
any
moment
show
himself
to
them
in
some
way
that
would
strike
anguish
*NL*
and
penitence
into
their
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
turning
to
the
left
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
*NL*
point
above
the
heads
of
the
people
.
``
See
where
our
blessed
Lord
stands
*NL*
and
weeps
and
stretches
out
his
arms
towards
you
.
Hear
what
he
says
:
*NL*
`
How
often
would
I
have
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
*NL*
under
her
wings
,
and
ye
would
not
!
'
...
and
ye
would
not
,
''
she
repeated
,
*NL*
in
a
tone
of
pleading
reproach
,
turning
her
eyes
on
the
people
again
.
*NL*
``
See
the
print
of
the
nails
on
his
dear
hands
and
feet
.
It
is
your
sins
*NL*
that
made
them
!
Ah
!
How
pale
and
worn
he
looks
!
He
has
gone
through
all
*NL*
that
great
agony
in
the
garden
,
when
his
soul
was
exceeding
sorrowful
*NL*
even
unto
death
,
and
the
great
drops
of
sweat
fell
like
blood
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
They
spat
upon
him
and
buffeted
him
,
they
scourged
him
,
they
*NL*
mocked
him
,
they
laid
the
heavy
cross
on
his
bruised
shoulders
.
Then
*NL*
they
nailed
him
up
.
Ah
,
what
pain
!
His
lips
are
parched
with
thirst
,
and
*NL*
they
mock
him
still
in
this
great
agony
;
yet
with
those
parched
lips
he
*NL*
prays
for
them
,
`
Father
,
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
'
*NL*
Then
a
horror
of
great
darkness
fell
upon
him
,
and
he
felt
what
sinners
*NL*
feel
when
they
are
for
ever
shut
out
from
God
.
That
was
the
last
drop
*NL*
in
the
cup
of
bitterness
.
`
My
God
,
my
God
!
'
he
cries
,
`
why
hast
Thou
*NL*
forsaken
me
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
he
bore
for
you
!
For
you
--
and
you
never
think
of
him
;
for
*NL*
you
--
and
you
turn
your
backs
on
him
;
you
do
n't
care
what
he
has
gone
*NL*
through
for
you
.
Yet
he
is
not
weary
of
toiling
for
you
:
he
has
risen
*NL*
from
the
dead
,
he
is
praying
for
you
at
the
right
hand
of
God
--
`
Father
,
*NL*
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
'
And
he
is
upon
this
earth
*NL*
too
;
he
is
among
us
;
he
is
there
close
to
you
now
;
I
see
his
wounded
*NL*
body
and
his
look
of
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Dinah
turned
to
Bessy
Cranage
,
whose
bonny
youth
and
evident
vanity
*NL*
had
touched
her
with
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
child
!
Poor
child
!
He
is
beseeching
you
,
and
you
do
n't
listen
to
*NL*
him
.
You
think
of
ear-rings
and
fine
gowns
and
caps
,
and
you
never
think
*NL*
of
the
Saviour
who
died
to
save
your
precious
soul
.
Your
cheeks
will
be
*NL*
shrivelled
one
day
,
your
hair
will
be
grey
,
your
poor
body
will
be
thin
*NL*
and
tottering
!
Then
you
will
begin
to
feel
that
your
soul
is
not
saved
;
*NL*
then
you
will
have
to
stand
before
God
dressed
in
your
sins
,
in
your
*NL*
evil
tempers
and
vain
thoughts
.
And
Jesus
,
who
stands
ready
to
help
you
*NL*
now
,
wo
n't
help
you
then
;
because
you
wo
n't
have
him
to
be
your
Saviour
,
*NL*
he
will
be
your
judge
.
Now
he
looks
at
you
with
love
and
mercy
and
says
,
*NL*
`
Come
to
me
that
you
may
have
life
'
;
then
he
will
turn
away
from
you
,
*NL*
and
say
,
`
Depart
from
me
into
ever-lasting
fire
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Bessy
's
wide-open
black
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
,
her
great
*NL*
red
cheeks
and
lips
became
quite
pale
,
and
her
face
was
distorted
like
a
*NL*
little
child
's
before
a
burst
of
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
blind
child
!
''
Dinah
went
on
,
``
think
if
it
should
happen
to
you
*NL*
as
it
once
happened
to
a
servant
of
God
in
the
days
of
her
vanity
.
SHE
*NL*
thought
of
her
lace
caps
and
saved
all
her
money
to
buy
'em
;
she
thought
*NL*
nothing
about
how
she
might
get
a
clean
heart
and
a
right
spirit
--
she
*NL*
only
wanted
to
have
better
lace
than
other
girls
.
And
one
day
when
she
*NL*
put
her
new
cap
on
and
looked
in
the
glass
,
she
saw
a
bleeding
Face
*NL*
crowned
with
thorns
.
That
face
is
looking
at
you
now
''
--
here
Dinah
*NL*
pointed
to
a
spot
close
in
front
of
Bessy
--
``
Ah
,
tear
off
those
follies
!
*NL*
Cast
them
away
from
you
,
as
if
they
were
stinging
adders

They
ARE
*NL*
stinging
you
--
they
are
poisoning
your
soul
--
they
are
dragging
you
down
*NL*
into
a
dark
bottomless
pit
,
where
you
will
sink
for
ever
,
and
for
ever
,
*NL*
and
for
ever
,
further
away
from
light
and
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessy
could
bear
it
no
longer
:
a
great
terror
was
upon
her
,
and
*NL*
wrenching
her
ear-rings
from
her
ears
,
she
threw
them
down
before
her
,
*NL*
sobbing
aloud
.
Her
father
,
Chad
,
frightened
lest
he
should
be
``
laid
hold
*NL*
on
''
too
,
this
impression
on
the
rebellious
Bess
striking
him
as
nothing
*NL*
less
than
a
miracle
,
walked
hastily
away
and
began
to
work
at
his
anvil
*NL*
by
way
of
reassuring
himself
.
``
Folks
mun
ha
'
hoss-shoes
,
praichin
'
or
*NL*
no
praichin
'
:
the
divil
canna
lay
hould
o
'
me
for
that
,
''
he
muttered
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Dinah
began
to
tell
of
the
joys
that
were
in
store
for
the
*NL*
penitent
,
and
to
describe
in
her
simple
way
the
divine
peace
and
love
*NL*
with
which
the
soul
of
the
believer
is
filled
--
how
the
sense
of
God
's
*NL*
love
turns
poverty
into
riches
and
satisfies
the
soul
so
that
no
uneasy
*NL*
desire
vexes
it
,
no
fear
alarms
it
:
how
,
at
last
,
the
very
temptation
*NL*
to
sin
is
extinguished
,
and
heaven
is
begun
upon
earth
,
because
no
cloud
*NL*
passes
between
the
soul
and
God
,
who
is
its
eternal
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friends
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
brothers
and
sisters
,
whom
I
love
*NL*
as
those
for
whom
my
Lord
has
died
,
believe
me
,
I
know
what
this
great
*NL*
blessedness
is
;
and
because
I
know
it
,
I
want
you
to
have
it
too
.
I
am
*NL*
poor
,
like
you
:
I
have
to
get
my
living
with
my
hands
;
but
no
lord
nor
*NL*
lady
can
be
so
happy
as
me
,
if
they
have
n't
got
the
love
of
God
in
their
*NL*
souls
.
Think
what
it
is
--
not
to
hate
anything
but
sin
;
to
be
full
of
*NL*
love
to
every
creature
;
to
be
frightened
at
nothing
;
to
be
sure
that
all
*NL*
things
will
turn
to
good
;
not
to
mind
pain
,
because
it
is
our
Father

*NL*
will

to
know
that
nothing

no
,
not
if
the
earth
was
to
be
burnt
up
,
or
*NL*
the
waters
come
and
drown
us
--
nothing
could
part
us
from
God
who
loves
*NL*
us
,
and
who
fills
our
souls
with
peace
and
joy
,
because
we
are
sure
that
*NL*
whatever
he
wills
is
holy
,
just
,
and
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friends
,
come
and
take
this
blessedness
;
it
is
offered
to
you
;
it
*NL*
is
the
good
news
that
Jesus
came
to
preach
to
the
poor
.
It
is
not
like
*NL*
the
riches
of
this
world
,
so
that
the
more
one
gets
the
less
the
rest
*NL*
can
have
.
God
is
without
end
;
his
love
is
without
end

''
*NL*
*NL*
Its
streams
the
whole
creation
reach
,
*NL*
So
plenteous
is
the
store
;
*NL*
Enough
for
all
,
enough
for
each
,
*NL*
Enough
for
evermore

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
had
been
speaking
at
least
an
hour
,
and
the
reddening
light
of
the
*NL*
parting
day
seemed
to
give
a
solemn
emphasis
to
her
closing
words
.
The
*NL*
stranger
,
who
had
been
interested
in
the
course
of
her
sermon
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
the
development
of
a
drama
--
for
there
is
this
sort
of
*NL*
fascination
in
all
sincere
unpremeditated
eloquence
,
which
opens
to
one
*NL*
the
inward
drama
of
the
speaker
's
emotions
--
now
turned
his
horse
aside
*NL*
and
pursued
his
way
,
while
Dinah
said
,
``
Let
us
sing
a
little
,
dear
*NL*
friends
''
;
and
as
he
was
still
winding
down
the
slope
,
the
voices
of
the
*NL*
Methodists
reached
him
,
rising
and
falling
in
that
strange
blending
of
*NL*
exultation
and
sadness
which
belongs
to
the
cadence
of
a
hymn

Chapter
III
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
Preaching
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
less
than
an
hour
from
that
time
,
Seth
Bede
was
walking
by
Dinah
's
*NL*
side
along
the
hedgerow-path
that
skirted
the
pastures
and
green
*NL*
corn-fields
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
Hall
Farm
.
Dinah
had
*NL*
taken
off
her
little
Quaker
bonnet
again
,
and
was
holding
it
in
*NL*
her
hands
that
she
might
have
a
freer
enjoyment
of
the
cool
evening
*NL*
twilight
,
and
Seth
could
see
the
expression
of
her
face
quite
clearly
as
*NL*
he
walked
by
her
side
,
timidly
revolving
something
he
wanted
to
say
to
*NL*
her
.
It
was
an
expression
of
unconscious
placid
gravity
--
of
absorption
*NL*
in
thoughts
that
had
no
connection
with
the
present
moment
or
with
her
*NL*
own
personality
--
an
expression
that
is
most
of
all
discouraging
to
a
*NL*
lover
.
Her
very
walk
was
discouraging
:
it
had
that
quiet
elasticity
that
*NL*
asks
for
no
support
.
Seth
felt
this
dimly
;
he
said
to
himself
,
``
She
's
*NL*
too
good
and
holy
for
any
man
,
let
alone
me
,
''
and
the
words
he
had
*NL*
been
summoning
rushed
back
again
before
they
had
reached
his
lips
.
But
*NL*
another
thought
gave
him
courage
:
``
There
's
no
man
could
love
her
better
*NL*
and
leave
her
freer
to
follow
the
Lord
's
work
.
''
They
had
been
silent
for
*NL*
many
minutes
now
,
since
they
had
done
talking
about
Bessy
Cranage
;
*NL*
Dinah
seemed
almost
to
have
forgotten
Seth
's
presence
,
and
her
pace
*NL*
was
becoming
so
much
quicker
that
the
sense
of
their
being
only
a
few
*NL*
minutes
'
walk
from
the
yard-gates
of
the
Hall
Farm
at
last
gave
Seth
*NL*
courage
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
go
back
to
Snowfield
o
'
Saturday
,
*NL*
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dinah
,
quietly
.
``
I
'm
called
there
.
It
was
borne
in
upon
my
*NL*
mind
while
I
was
meditating
on
Sunday
night
,
as
Sister
Allen
,
who
's
in
a
*NL*
decline
,
is
in
need
of
me
.
I
saw
her
as
plain
as
we
see
that
bit
of
thin
*NL*
white
cloud
,
lifting
up
her
poor
thin
hand
and
beckoning
to
me
.
And
this
*NL*
morning
when
I
opened
the
Bible
for
direction
,
the
first
words
my
*NL*
eyes
fell
on
were
,
`
And
after
we
had
seen
the
vision
,
immediately
we
*NL*
endeavoured
to
go
into
Macedonia
.
'
If
it
was
n't
for
that
clear
showing
*NL*
of
the
Lord
's
will
,
I
should
be
loath
to
go
,
for
my
heart
yearns
over
*NL*
my
aunt
and
her
little
ones
,
and
that
poor
wandering
lamb
Hetty
Sorrel
.
*NL*
I
've
been
much
drawn
out
in
prayer
for
her
of
late
,
and
I
look
on
it
as
*NL*
a
token
that
there
may
be
mercy
in
store
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
it
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
For
I
doubt
Adam
's
heart
is
so
set
on
her
,
*NL*
he
'll
never
turn
to
anybody
else
;
and
yet
it
`
ud
go
to
my
heart
if
he
*NL*
was
to
marry
her
,
for
I
canna
think
as
she
'd
make
him
happy
.
It
's
a
deep
*NL*
mystery
--
the
way
the
heart
of
man
turns
to
one
woman
out
of
all
the
rest
*NL*
he
's
seen
i
'
the
world
,
and
makes
it
easier
for
him
to
work
seven
year
*NL*
for
HER
,
like
Jacob
did
for
Rachel
,
sooner
than
have
any
other
woman
for
*NL*
th
'
asking
.
I
often
think
of
them
words
,
`
And
Jacob
served
seven
years
*NL*
for
Rachel
;
and
they
seemed
to
him
but
a
few
days
for
the
love
he
had
*NL*
to
her
.
'
I
know
those
words
`
ud
come
true
with
me
,
Dinah
,
if
so
be
you
'd
*NL*
give
me
hope
as
I
might
win
you
after
seven
years
was
over
.
I
know
you
*NL*
think
a
husband
`
ud
be
taking
up
too
much
o
'
your
thoughts
,
because
St.
*NL*
Paul
says
,
`
She
that
's
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
*NL*
she
may
please
her
husband
'
;
and
may
happen
you
'll
think
me
overbold
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
about
it
again
,
after
what
you
told
me
o
'
your
mind
last
*NL*
Saturday
.
But
I
've
been
thinking
it
over
again
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
*NL*
I
've
prayed
not
to
be
blinded
by
my
own
desires
,
to
think
what
's
only
*NL*
good
for
me
must
be
good
for
you
too
.
And
it
seems
to
me
there
's
more
*NL*
texts
for
your
marrying
than
ever
you
can
find
against
it
.
For
St.
Paul
*NL*
says
as
plain
as
can
be
in
another
place
,
'
I
will
that
the
younger
*NL*
women
marry
,
bear
children
,
guide
the
house
,
give
none
occasion
to
the
*NL*
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully
'
;
and
then
`
two
are
better
than
one
'
;
*NL*
and
that
holds
good
with
marriage
as
well
as
with
other
things
.
For
we
*NL*
should
be
o
'
one
heart
and
o
'
one
mind
,
Dinah
.
We
both
serve
the
same
*NL*
Master
,
and
are
striving
after
the
same
gifts
;
and
I
'd
never
be
the
*NL*
husband
to
make
a
claim
on
you
as
could
interfere
with
your
doing
the
*NL*
work
God
has
fitted
you
for
.
I
'd
make
a
shift
,
and
fend
indoor
and
out
,
*NL*
to
give
you
more
liberty
--
more
than
you
can
have
now
,
for
you
've
got
to
*NL*
get
your
own
living
now
,
and
I
'm
strong
enough
to
work
for
us
both
.

*NL*
*NL*
When
Seth
had
once
begun
to
urge
his
suit
,
he
went
on
earnestly
and
*NL*
almost
hurriedly
,
lest
Dinah
should
speak
some
decisive
word
before
he
*NL*
had
poured
forth
all
the
arguments
he
had
prepared
.
His
cheeks
became
*NL*
flushed
as
he
went
on
his
mild
grey
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
his
*NL*
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
.
They
had
reached
one
of
*NL*
those
very
narrow
passes
between
two
tall
stones
,
which
performed
the
*NL*
office
of
a
stile
in
Loamshire
,
and
Dinah
paused
as
she
turned
towards
*NL*
Seth
and
said
,
in
her
tender
but
calm
treble
notes
,
``
Seth
Bede
,
I
thank
*NL*
you
for
your
love
towards
me
,
and
if
I
could
think
of
any
man
as
more
*NL*
than
a
Christian
brother
,
I
think
it
would
be
you
.
But
my
heart
is
not
*NL*
free
to
marry
.
That
is
good
for
other
women
,
and
it
is
a
great
and
a
*NL*
blessed
thing
to
be
a
wife
and
mother
;
but
`
as
God
has
distributed
to
*NL*
every
man
,
as
the
Lord
hath
called
every
man
,
so
let
him
walk
.
'
God
has
*NL*
called
me
to
minister
to
others
,
not
to
have
any
joys
or
sorrows
of
my
*NL*
own
,
but
to
rejoice
with
them
that
do
rejoice
,
and
to
weep
with
those
*NL*
that
weep
.
He
has
called
me
to
speak
his
word
,
and
he
has
greatly
owned
*NL*
my
work
.
It
could
only
be
on
a
very
clear
showing
that
I
could
leave
the
*NL*
brethren
and
sisters
at
Snowfield
,
who
are
favoured
with
very
little
of
*NL*
this
world
's
good
;
where
the
trees
are
few
,
so
that
a
child
might
count
*NL*
them
,
and
there
's
very
hard
living
for
the
poor
in
the
winter
.
It
has
*NL*
been
given
me
to
help
,
to
comfort
,
and
strengthen
the
little
flock
there
*NL*
and
to
call
in
many
wanderers
;
and
my
soul
is
filled
with
these
things
*NL*
from
my
rising
up
till
my
lying
down
.
My
life
is
too
short
,
and
God
's
*NL*
work
is
too
great
for
me
to
think
of
making
a
home
for
myself
in
this
*NL*
world
.
I
've
not
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
your
words
,
Seth
,
for
when
I
saw
as
*NL*
your
love
was
given
to
me
,
I
thought
it
might
be
a
leading
of
Providence
*NL*
for
me
to
change
my
way
of
life
,
and
that
we
should
be
fellow-helpers
;
*NL*
and
I
spread
the
matter
before
the
Lord
.
But
whenever
I
tried
to
fix
my
*NL*
mind
on
marriage
,
and
our
living
together
,
other
thoughts
always
came
*NL*
in
--
the
times
when
I
've
prayed
by
the
sick
and
dying
,
and
the
happy
*NL*
hours
I
've
had
preaching
,
when
my
heart
was
filled
with
love
,
and
the
*NL*
Word
was
given
to
me
abundantly
.
And
when
I
've
opened
the
Bible
for
*NL*
direction
,
I
've
always
lighted
on
some
clear
word
to
tell
me
where
my
*NL*
work
lay
.
I
believe
what
you
say
,
Seth
,
that
you
would
try
to
be
a
help
*NL*
and
not
a
hindrance
to
my
work
;
but
I
see
that
our
marriage
is
not
God
's
*NL*
will
--
He
draws
my
heart
another
way
.
I
desire
to
live
and
die
without
*NL*
husband
or
children
.
I
seem
to
have
no
room
in
my
soul
for
wants
and
*NL*
fears
of
my
own
,
it
has
pleased
God
to
fill
my
heart
so
full
with
the
*NL*
wants
and
sufferings
of
his
poor
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
unable
to
reply
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
At
last
,
as
*NL*
they
were
nearly
at
the
yard-gate
,
he
said
,
``
Well
,
Dinah
,
I
must
seek
*NL*
for
strength
to
bear
it
,
and
to
endure
as
seeing
Him
who
is
invisible
.
*NL*
But
I
feel
now
how
weak
my
faith
is
.
It
seems
as
if
,
when
you
are
gone
,
*NL*
I
could
never
joy
in
anything
any
more
.
I
think
it
's
something
passing
*NL*
the
love
of
women
as
I
feel
for
you
,
for
I
could
be
content
without
*NL*
your
marrying
me
if
I
could
go
and
live
at
Snowfield
and
be
near
you
.
*NL*
I
trusted
as
the
strong
love
God
has
given
me
towards
you
was
a
leading
*NL*
for
us
both
;
but
it
seems
it
was
only
meant
for
my
trial
.
Perhaps
I
feel
*NL*
more
for
you
than
I
ought
to
feel
for
any
creature
,
for
I
often
ca
n't
*NL*
help
saying
of
you
what
the
hymn
says
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
darkest
shades
if
she
appear
,
*NL*
My
dawning
is
begun
;
*NL*
She
is
my
soul
's
bright
morning-star
,
*NL*
And
she
my
rising
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
may
be
wrong
,
and
I
am
to
be
taught
better
.
But
you
would
n't
be
*NL*
displeased
with
me
if
things
turned
out
so
as
I
could
leave
this
country
*NL*
and
go
to
live
at
Snowfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Seth
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
wait
patiently
,
and
not
lightly
to
*NL*
leave
your
own
country
and
kindred
.
Do
nothing
without
the
Lord
's
clear
*NL*
bidding
.
It
's
a
bleak
and
barren
country
there
,
not
like
this
land
of
*NL*
Goshen
you
've
been
used
to
.
We
must
n't
be
in
a
hurry
to
fix
and
choose
*NL*
our
own
lot
;
we
must
wait
to
be
guided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'd
let
me
write
you
a
letter
,
Dinah
,
if
there
was
anything
I
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sure
;
let
me
know
if
you
're
in
any
trouble
.
You
'll
be
continually
*NL*
in
my
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
now
reached
the
yard-gate
,
and
Seth
said
,
``
I
wo
n't
go
in
,
*NL*
Dinah
,
so
farewell
.
''
He
paused
and
hesitated
after
she
had
given
him
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
then
said
,
``
There
's
no
knowing
but
what
you
may
see
things
*NL*
different
after
a
while
.
There
may
be
a
new
leading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
leave
that
,
Seth
.
It
's
good
to
live
only
a
moment
at
a
time
,
as
*NL*
I
've
read
in
one
of
Mr.
Wesley
's
books
.
It
is
n't
for
you
and
me
to
lay
*NL*
plans
;
we
've
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
and
to
trust
.
Farewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
pressed
his
hand
with
rather
a
sad
look
in
her
loving
eyes
,
and
*NL*
then
passed
through
the
gate
,
while
Seth
turned
away
to
walk
lingeringly
*NL*
home
.
But
instead
of
taking
the
direct
road
,
he
chose
to
turn
back
along
*NL*
the
fields
through
which
he
and
Dinah
had
already
passed
;
and
I
think
*NL*
his
blue
linen
handkerchief
was
very
wet
with
tears
long
before
he
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
set
his
face
steadily
*NL*
homewards
.
He
was
but
three-and-twenty
,
and
had
only
just
learned
what
*NL*
it
is
to
love
--
to
love
with
that
adoration
which
a
young
man
gives
to
a
*NL*
woman
whom
he
feels
to
be
greater
and
better
than
himself
.
Love
of
this
*NL*
sort
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
religious
feeling
.
What
deep
and
*NL*
worthy
love
is
so
,
whether
of
woman
or
child
,
or
art
or
music
.
Our
*NL*
caresses
,
our
tender
words
,
our
still
rapture
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
autumn
sunsets
,
or
pillared
vistas
,
or
calm
majestic
statues
,
or
*NL*
Beethoven
symphonies
all
bring
with
them
the
consciousness
that
they
are
*NL*
mere
waves
and
ripples
in
an
unfathomable
ocean
of
love
and
beauty
;
our
*NL*
emotion
in
its
keenest
moment
passes
from
expression
into
silence
,
our
*NL*
love
at
its
highest
flood
rushes
beyond
its
object
and
loses
itself
in
*NL*
the
sense
of
divine
mystery
.
And
this
blessed
gift
of
venerating
love
*NL*
has
been
given
to
too
many
humble
craftsmen
since
the
world
began
for
*NL*
us
to
feel
any
surprise
that
it
should
have
existed
in
the
soul
of
a
*NL*
Methodist
carpenter
half
a
century
ago
,
while
there
was
yet
a
lingering
*NL*
after-glow
from
the
time
when
Wesley
and
his
fellow-labourer
fed
on
the
*NL*
hips
and
haws
of
the
Cornwall
hedges
,
after
exhausting
limbs
and
lungs
*NL*
in
carrying
a
divine
message
to
the
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afterglow
has
long
faded
away
;
and
the
picture
we
are
apt
to
make
*NL*
of
Methodism
in
our
imagination
is
not
an
amphitheatre
of
green
hills
,
*NL*
or
the
deep
shade
of
broad-leaved
sycamores
,
where
a
crowd
of
rough
*NL*
men
and
weary-hearted
women
drank
in
a
faith
which
was
a
rudimentary
*NL*
culture
,
which
linked
their
thoughts
with
the
past
,
lifted
their
*NL*
imagination
above
the
sordid
details
of
their
own
narrow
lives
,
and
*NL*
suffused
their
souls
with
the
sense
of
a
pitying
,
loving
,
infinite
*NL*
Presence
,
sweet
as
summer
to
the
houseless
needy
.
It
is
too
possible
*NL*
that
to
some
of
my
readers
Methodism
may
mean
nothing
more
than
*NL*
low-pitched
gables
up
dingy
streets
,
sleek
grocers
,
sponging
preachers
,
*NL*
and
hypocritical
jargon
--
elements
which
are
regarded
as
an
exhaustive
*NL*
analysis
of
Methodism
in
many
fashionable
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
would
be
a
pity
;
for
I
can
not
pretend
that
Seth
and
Dinah
were
*NL*
anything
else
than
Methodists
--
not
indeed
of
that
modern
type
which
*NL*
reads
quarterly
reviews
and
attends
in
chapels
with
pillared
porticoes
,
*NL*
but
of
a
very
old-fashioned
kind
.
They
believed
in
present
miracles
,
in
*NL*
instantaneous
conversions
,
in
revelations
by
dreams
and
visions
;
they
*NL*
drew
lots
,
and
sought
for
Divine
guidance
by
opening
the
Bible
at
*NL*
hazard
;
having
a
literal
way
of
interpreting
the
Scriptures
,
which
is
*NL*
not
at
all
sanctioned
by
approved
commentators
;
and
it
is
impossible
*NL*
for
me
to
represent
their
diction
as
correct
,
or
their
instruction
as
*NL*
liberal
.
Still
--
if
I
have
read
religious
history
aright
--
faith
,
*NL*
hope
,
and
charity
have
not
always
been
found
in
a
direct
ratio
with
a
*NL*
sensibility
to
the
three
concords
,
and
it
is
possible
--
thank
Heaven
!
--
to
*NL*
have
very
erroneous
theories
and
very
sublime
feelings
.
The
raw
bacon
*NL*
which
clumsy
Molly
spares
from
her
own
scanty
store
that
she
may
carry
*NL*
it
to
her
neighbour
's
child
to
``
stop
the
fits
,
''
may
be
a
piteously
*NL*
inefficacious
remedy
;
but
the
generous
stirring
of
neighbourly
kindness
*NL*
that
prompted
the
deed
has
a
beneficent
radiation
that
is
not
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Considering
these
things
,
we
can
hardly
think
Dinah
and
Seth
beneath
our
*NL*
sympathy
,
accustomed
as
we
may
be
to
weep
over
the
loftier
sorrows
*NL*
of
heroines
in
satin
boots
and
crinoline
,
and
of
heroes
riding
fiery
*NL*
horses
,
themselves
ridden
by
still
more
fiery
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Seth
!
He
was
never
on
horseback
in
his
life
except
once
,
when
he
*NL*
was
a
little
lad
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
took
him
up
behind
,
telling
*NL*
him
to
``
hold
on
tight
''
;
and
instead
of
bursting
out
into
wild
accusing
*NL*
apostrophes
to
God
and
destiny
,
he
is
resolving
,
as
he
now
walks
*NL*
homewards
under
the
solemn
starlight
,
to
repress
his
sadness
,
to
be
less
*NL*
bent
on
having
his
own
will
,
and
to
live
more
for
others
,
as
Dinah
does
.

Chapter
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Home
and
Its
Sorrows
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
GREEN
valley
with
a
brook
running
through
it
,
full
almost
to
*NL*
overflowing
with
the
late
rains
,
overhung
by
low
stooping
willows
.
*NL*
Across
this
brook
a
plank
is
thrown
,
and
over
this
plank
Adam
Bede
is
*NL*
passing
with
his
undoubting
step
,
followed
close
by
Gyp
with
the
basket
;
*NL*
evidently
making
his
way
to
the
thatched
house
,
with
a
stack
of
timber
*NL*
by
the
side
of
it
,
about
twenty
yards
up
the
opposite
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
house
is
open
,
and
an
elderly
woman
is
looking
out
;
but
*NL*
she
is
not
placidly
contemplating
the
evening
sunshine
;
she
has
been
*NL*
watching
with
dim
eyes
the
gradually
enlarging
speck
which
for
the
last
*NL*
few
minutes
she
has
been
quite
sure
is
her
darling
son
Adam
.
Lisbeth
*NL*
Bede
loves
her
son
with
the
love
of
a
woman
to
whom
her
first-born
has
*NL*
come
late
in
life
.
She
is
an
anxious
,
spare
,
yet
vigorous
old
woman
,
*NL*
clean
as
a
snowdrop
.
Her
grey
hair
is
turned
neatly
back
under
a
pure
*NL*
linen
cap
with
a
black
band
round
it
;
her
broad
chest
is
covered
with
a
*NL*
buff
neckerchief
,
and
below
this
you
see
a
sort
of
short
bedgown
made
of
*NL*
blue-checkered
linen
,
tied
round
the
waist
and
descending
to
the
hips
,
*NL*
from
whence
there
is
a
considerable
length
of
linsey-woolsey
petticoat
.
*NL*
For
Lisbeth
is
tall
,
and
in
other
points
too
there
is
a
strong
*NL*
likeness
between
her
and
her
son
Adam
.
Her
dark
eyes
are
somewhat
dim
*NL*
now
--
perhaps
from
too
much
crying
--
but
her
broadly
marked
eyebrows
are
*NL*
still
black
,
her
teeth
are
sound
,
and
as
she
stands
knitting
rapidly
and
*NL*
unconsciously
with
her
work-hardened
hands
,
she
has
as
firmly
upright
*NL*
an
attitude
as
when
she
is
carrying
a
pail
of
water
on
her
head
from
the
*NL*
spring
.
There
is
the
same
type
of
frame
and
the
same
keen
activity
of
*NL*
temperament
in
mother
and
son
,
but
it
was
not
from
her
that
Adam
got
his
*NL*
well-filled
brow
and
his
expression
of
large-hearted
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Family
likeness
has
often
a
deep
sadness
in
it
.
Nature
,
that
great
*NL*
tragic
dramatist
,
knits
us
together
by
bone
and
muscle
,
and
divides
us
*NL*
by
the
subtler
web
of
our
brains
;
blends
yearning
and
repulsion
;
*NL*
and
ties
us
by
our
heart-strings
to
the
beings
that
jar
us
at
every
*NL*
movement
.
We
hear
a
voice
with
the
very
cadence
of
our
own
uttering
the
*NL*
thoughts
we
despise
;
we
see
eyes
--
ah
,
so
like
our
mother
's
!
--
averted
*NL*
from
us
in
cold
alienation
;
and
our
last
darling
child
startles
us
with
*NL*
the
air
and
gestures
of
the
sister
we
parted
from
in
bitterness
long
*NL*
years
ago
.
The
father
to
whom
we
owe
our
best
heritage
--
the
mechanical
*NL*
instinct
,
the
keen
sensibility
to
harmony
,
the
unconscious
skill
of
the
*NL*
modelling
hand
--
galls
us
and
puts
us
to
shame
by
his
daily
errors
;
the
*NL*
long-lost
mother
,
whose
face
we
begin
to
see
in
the
glass
as
our
own
*NL*
wrinkles
come
,
once
fretted
our
young
souls
with
her
anxious
humours
and
*NL*
irrational
persistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
such
a
fond
anxious
mother
's
voice
that
you
hear
,
as
Lisbeth
says
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
it
's
gone
seven
by
th
'
clock
.
Thee

t

*NL*
last

Where
's
Seth
?
*NL*
Gone

some
o

,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
Seth
's
at
no
harm
,
mother
,
thee
mayst
be
sure
.
But
where
's
*NL*
father
?
''
said
Adam
quickly
,
as
he
entered
the
house
and
glanced
into
the
*NL*
room
on
the
left
hand
,
which
was
used
as
a
workshop
.
``
Has
n't
he
done
the
*NL*
coffin
for
Tholer
?
There
's
the
stuff
standing
just
as
I
left
it
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
the
coffin
?
''
said
Lisbeth
,
following
him
,
and
knitting
*NL*
uninterruptedly
,
though
she
looked
at
her
son
very
anxiously
.
``
Eh
,
my
*NL*
lad
,
he
went
aff
to
Treddles
`
on
this
forenoon
,
an

niver
come
back
.
I
*NL*
doubt
he
's
got
to
th
'
`
Waggin
Overthrow
'
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
flush
of
anger
passed
rapidly
over
Adam
's
face
.
He
said
nothing
,
*NL*
but
threw
off
his
jacket
and
began
to
roll
up
his
shirt-sleeves
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
goin
'
to
do
,
Adam
?
''
said
the
mother
,
with
a
tone
and
look
*NL*
of
alarm
.
``
Thee
wouldstna
go
to
work
again
,
wi'out
ha'in
thy
bit
o
'
*NL*
supper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
too
angry
to
speak
,
walked
into
the
workshop
.
But
his
mother
threw
*NL*
down
her
knitting
,
and
,
hurrying
after
him
,
took
hold
of
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
said
,
in
a
tone
of
plaintive
remonstrance
,
``
Nay
,
my
lad
,
my
lad
,
thee
*NL*
munna
go
wi'out
thy
supper
;
there
's
the

the
gravy
in

*NL*
just

I
saved
'em

for

Come
an

*NL*
thy
supper
,
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
be
!
''
said
Adam
impetuously
,
shaking
her
off
and
seizing
one
of
*NL*
the
planks
that
stood
against
the
wall
.
``
It
's
fine
talking
about
having
*NL*
supper
when
here
's
a
coffin
promised
to
be
ready
at
Brox
`
on
by
seven
*NL*
o'clock
to-morrow
morning
,
and
ought
to
ha
'
been
there
now
,
and
not
a
*NL*
nail
struck
yet
.
My
throat
's
too
full
to
swallow
victuals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
thee
canstna
get
the
coffin
ready
,
''
said
Lisbeth
.
``
Thee
'
t
work
*NL*
thyself
to
death
.
It
`
ud
take
thee
all
night
to
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
signifies
how
long
it
takes
me
?
Is
n't
the
coffin
promised
?
Can
*NL*
they
bury
the
man
without
a
coffin
?
I
'd
work
my
right
hand
off
sooner
*NL*
than
deceive
people
with
lies
i

that
way

It
makes

I
shall
overrun
these
doings
before
long
.
I
've
stood
enough
of
*NL*
'em

''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lisbeth
did
not
hear
this
threat
for
the
first
time
,
and
if
she
had
*NL*
been
wise
she
would
have
gone
away
quietly
and
said
nothing
for
the
next
*NL*
hour
.
But
one
of
the
lessons
a
woman
most
rarely
learns
is
never
to
talk
*NL*
to
an
angry
or
a
drunken
man
.
Lisbeth
sat
down
on
the
chopping
bench
*NL*
and
began
to
cry
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
cried
enough
to
make
her
voice
*NL*
very
piteous
,
she
burst
out
into
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

ear
ago

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
's
voice
became
louder
,
and
choked
with
sobs
--
a
sort
of
wail
,
*NL*
the
most
irritating
of
all
sounds
where
real
sorrows
are
to
be
borne
and
*NL*
real
work
to
be
done
.
Adam
broke
in
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

Mother

do
n't

But

hate

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
dared
not
say
any
more
;
but
she
got
up
and
called
Gyp
,
thinking
*NL*
to
console
herself
somewhat
for
Adam
's
refusal
of
the
supper
she
had
*NL*
spread
out
in
the
loving
expectation
of
looking
at
him
while
he
ate
it
,
*NL*
by
feeding
Adam
's
dog
with
extra
liberality
.
But
Gyp
was
watching
his
*NL*
master
with
wrinkled
brow
and
ears
erect
,
puzzled
at
this
unusual
course
*NL*
of
things
;
and
though
he
glanced
at
Lisbeth
when
she
called
him
,
and
*NL*
moved
his
fore-paws
uneasily
,
well
knowing
that
she
was
inviting
him
to
*NL*
supper
,
he
was
in
a
divided
state
of
mind
,
and
remained
seated
on
his
*NL*
haunches
,
again
fixing
his
eyes
anxiously
on
his
master
.
Adam
noticed
*NL*
Gyp
's
mental
conflict
,
and
though
his
anger
had
made
him
less
tender
*NL*
than
usual
to
his
mother
,
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
caring
as
much
as
*NL*
usual
for
his
dog
.
We
are
apt
to
be
kinder
to
the
brutes
that
love
us
*NL*
than
to
the
women
that
love
us
.
Is
it
because
the
brutes
are
dumb
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
Gyp
;
go
,
lad
!
''
Adam
said
,
in
a
tone
of
encouraging
command
;
and
*NL*
Gyp
,
apparently
satisfied
that
duty
and
pleasure
were
one
,
followed
*NL*
Lisbeth
into
the
house-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
sooner
had
he
licked
up
his
supper
than
he
went
back
to
his
*NL*
master
,
while
Lisbeth
sat
down
alone
to
cry
over
her
knitting
.
Women
*NL*
who
are
never
bitter
and
resentful
are
often
the
most
querulous
;
and
*NL*
if
Solomon
was
as
wise
as
he
is
reputed
to
be
,
I
feel
sure
that
when
*NL*
he
compared
a
contentious
woman
to
a
continual
dropping
on
a
very
rainy
*NL*
day
,
he
had
not
a
vixen
in
his
eye
--
a
fury
with
long
nails
,
acrid
and
*NL*
selfish
.
Depend
upon
it
,
he
meant
a
good
creature
,
who
had
no
joy
but
*NL*
in
the
happiness
of
the
loved
ones
whom
she
contributed
to
make
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
putting
by
all
the
tid-bits
for
them
and
spending
nothing
*NL*
on
herself
.
Such
a
woman
as
Lisbeth
,
for
example
--
at
once
patient
and
*NL*
complaining
,
self-renouncing
and
exacting
,
brooding
the
livelong
day
*NL*
over
what
happened
yesterday
and
what
is
likely
to
happen
to-morrow
,
*NL*
and
crying
very
readily
both
at
the
good
and
the
evil
.
But
a
certain
*NL*
awe
mingled
itself
with
her
idolatrous
love
of
Adam
,
and
when
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Leave

,
''
she
was
always
silenced
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
hours
passed
,
to
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day-clock
and
the
*NL*
sound
of
Adam
's
tools
.
At
last
he
called
for
a
light
and
a
draught
*NL*
of
water
-LRB-
beer
was
a
thing
only
to
be
drunk
on
holidays
-RRB-
,
and
Lisbeth
*NL*
ventured
to
say
as
she
took
it
in
,
``
Thy
supper
stan
's
ready
for
thee
,
*NL*
when
thee
lik
`
st.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Donna

up
,
mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
in
a
gentle
tone
.
He
had
worked
*NL*
off
his
anger
now
,
and
whenever
he
wished
to
be
especially
kind
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
he
fell
into
his
strongest
native
accent
and
dialect
,
with
which
*NL*
at
other
times
his
speech
was
less
deeply
tinged
.
``
I
'll
see
to
Father
*NL*
when
he
comes
home
;
maybe
he
wonna
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

I
'll
bide
till

comes

He
wonna
be
long
now

I

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
past
nine
by
the
clock
,
which
was
always
in
advance
of
*NL*
the
days
,
and
before
it
had
struck
ten
the
latch
was
lifted
and
Seth
*NL*
entered
.
He
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
tools
as
he
was
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
is
it
as
Father
's
working
so
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
was
going
on
,
for
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
Seth
,
and
usually
*NL*
poured
into
his
ears
all
the
querulousness
which
was
repressed
by
her
*NL*
awe
of
Adam
.
Seth
had
never
in
his
life
spoken
a
harsh
word
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
and
timid
people
always
wreak
their
peevishness
on
the
gentle
.
*NL*
But
Seth
,
with
an
anxious
look
,
had
passed
into
the
workshop
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Addy
,
how
's
this
?
What
!
Father
's
forgot
the
coffin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

th

tale

I

it
done

''
said
Adam
,
looking
up
*NL*
and
casting
one
of
his
bright
keen
glances
at
his
brother
.
``
Why
,
what
's
*NL*
the
matter
with
thee
?
Thee
'
t
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
's
eyes
were
red
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
deep
depression
on
his
*NL*
mild
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Addy

it
's

*NL*
*NL*
``

No

said
Adam
,
hammering
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

take
my

now

Seth

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Seth
knew
that
Adam
always
meant
what
he
said
,
and
was
not
to
be
*NL*
persuaded
into
meaning
anything
else
.
So
he
turned
,
with
rather
a
heavy
*NL*
heart

into
the
house-place

*NL*
*NL*

Lisbeth

though
disposed
always
to
take
the
negative
side
in
her

conversations

had
a
vague
sense
that
there
was
some
comfort

and
safety
in
the
fact
of
his
piety

that
it
somehow
relieved
her

from
the
trouble

any
spiritual
transactions

So
the
mother

knelt
down
together

Seth
prayed
for

poor

wandering
father

for
those
who
were
sorrowing
for
him
at

And
*NL*
when

came
to
the
petition

Adam
might
never

called
to
set
*NL*
up
his
tent
in

far
country

that
his

might
be
cheered
and
*NL*
comforted
by
his
presence
all
the
days
of
her
pilgrimage

Lisbeth

*NL*
ready
tears
flowed
again

she
wept
aloud

*NL*
*NL*
When
they
rose
from
their
knees

Seth
went
to
Adam
again

said
,
``

Meantime
Lisbeth
had
dried
her
eyes

and
now
followed
Seth
,
holding
*NL*
something
in
her
hands

It
was
the
brown-and-yellow
platter
containing
*NL*
the
baked
potatoes
with
the
gravy
in
them
and
bits
of
meat
which
she
had
*NL*
cut
and
mixed
among
them
.
Those
were
dear
times
,
when
wheaten
bread
*NL*
and
fresh
meat
were
delicacies
to
working
people
.
She
set
the
dish
down
*NL*
rather
timidly
on
the
bench
by
Adam
's
side
and
said
,
``
Thee
canst
pick
a
*NL*
bit
while
thee
'
t
workin
'
.
I
'll
bring
thee
another
drop
o
'
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
Mother
,
do
,
''
said
Adam
,
kindly
;
``
I
'm
getting
very
thirsty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
half
an
hour
all
was
quiet
;
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
house
but
*NL*
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day-clock
and
the
ringing
of
Adam
's
tools
.
*NL*
The
night
was
very
still
:
when
Adam
opened
the
door
to
look
out
at
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
,
the
only
motion
seemed
to
be
in
the
glowing
,
twinkling
*NL*
stars
;
every
blade
of
grass
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bodily
haste
and
exertion
usually
leave
our
thoughts
very
much
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
our
feelings
and
imagination
;
and
it
was
so
to-night
with
Adam
.
*NL*
While
his
muscles
were
working
lustily
,
his
mind
seemed
as
passive
as
a
*NL*
spectator
at
a
diorama
:
scenes
of
the
sad
past
,
and
probably
sad
*NL*
future
,
floating
before
him
and
giving
place
one
to
the
other
in
swift
*NL*
succession
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
how
it
would
be
to-morrow
morning
,
when
he
had
carried
the
coffin
*NL*
to
Broxton
and
was
at
home
again
,
having
his
breakfast
:
his
father
*NL*
perhaps
would
come
in
ashamed
to
meet
his
son
's
glance
--
would
sit
down
,
*NL*
looking
older
and
more
tottering
than
he
had
done
the
morning
before
,
*NL*
and
hang
down
his
head
,
examining
the
floor-quarries
;
while
Lisbeth
*NL*
would
ask
him
how
he
supposed
the
coffin
had
been
got
ready
,
that
he
had
*NL*
slinked
off
and
left
undone
--
for
Lisbeth
was
always
the
first
to
utter
*NL*
the
word
of
reproach
,
although
she
cried
at
Adam
's
severity
towards
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
will
go
on
,
worsening
and
worsening
,
''
thought
Adam
;
``
there
's
no
*NL*
slipping
uphill
again
,
and
no
standing
still
when
once
you
've
begun
*NL*
to
slip
down
.
''
And
then
the
day
came
back
to
him
when
he
was
a
little
*NL*
fellow
and
used
to
run
by
his
father
's
side
,
proud
to
be
taken
out
*NL*
to
work
,
and
prouder
still
to
hear
his
father
boasting
to
his
*NL*
fellow-workmen
how
``
the
little
chap
had
an
uncommon
notion
o
'
*NL*
carpentering
.
''
What
a
fine
active
fellow
his
father
was
then
!
When
*NL*
people
asked
Adam
whose
little
lad
he
was
,
he
had
a
sense
of
distinction
*NL*
as
he
answered
,
``
I
'm
Thias
Bede
's
lad
.
''
He
was
quite
sure
everybody
*NL*
knew
Thias
Bede
--
did
n't
he
make
the
wonderful
pigeon-house
at
Broxton
*NL*
parsonage
?
Those
were
happy
days
,
especially
when
Seth
,
who
was
three
*NL*
years
the
younger
,
began
to
go
out
working
too
,
and
Adam
began
to
be
a
*NL*
teacher
as
well
as
a
learner
.
But
then
came
the
days
of
sadness
,
when
*NL*
Adam
was
someway
on
in
his
teens
,
and
Thias
began
to
loiter
at
the
*NL*
public-houses
,
and
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
at
home
,
and
to
pour
forth
her
*NL*
plaints
in
the
hearing
of
her
sons
.
Adam
remembered
well
the
night
of
*NL*
shame
and
anguish
when
he
first
saw
his
father
quite
wild
and
foolish
,
*NL*
shouting
a
song
out
fitfully
among
his
drunken
companions
at
the
``
Waggon
*NL*
Overthrown
.
''
He
had
run
away
once
when
he
was
only
eighteen
,
making
*NL*
his
escape
in
the
morning
twilight
with
a
little
blue
bundle
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
and
his
``
mensuration
book
''
in
his
pocket
,
and
saying
*NL*
to
himself
very
decidedly
that
he
could
bear
the
vexations
of
home
no
*NL*
longer
--
he
would
go
and
seek
his
fortune
,
setting
up
his
stick
at
the
*NL*
crossways
and
bending
his
steps
the
way
it
fell
.
But
by
the
time
he
got
*NL*
to
Stoniton
,
the
thought
of
his
mother
and
Seth
,
left
behind
to
endure
*NL*
everything
without
him
,
became
too
importunate
,
and
his
resolution
*NL*
failed
him
.
He
came
back
the
next
day
,
but
the
misery
and
terror
his
*NL*
mother
had
gone
through
in
those
two
days
had
haunted
her
ever
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
Adam
said
to
himself
to-night
,
``
that
must
never
happen
again
.
It
*NL*
`
ud
make
a
poor
balance
when
my
doings
are
cast
up
at
the
last
,
if
my
*NL*
poor
old
mother
stood
o
'
the
wrong
side
.
My
back
's
broad
enough
and
*NL*
strong
enough
;
I
should
be
no
better
than
a
coward
to
go
away
and
leave
*NL*
the
troubles
to
be
borne
by
them
as
are
n't
half
so
able
.
`
They
that
are
*NL*
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
those
that
are
weak
,
and
not
to
*NL*
please
themselves
.
'
There
's
a
text
wants
no
candle
to
show
`
t
;
it
shines
*NL*
by
its
own
light
.
It
's
plain
enough
you
get
into
the
wrong
road
i
'
this
*NL*
life
if
you
run
after
this
and
that
only
for
the
sake
o
'
making
things
*NL*
easy
and
pleasant
to
yourself
.
A
pig
may
poke
his
nose
into
the
trough
*NL*
and
think
o
'
nothing
outside
it
;
but
if
you
've
got
a
man
's
heart
and
*NL*
soul
in
you
,
you
ca
n't
be
easy
a-making
your
own
bed
an
'
leaving
the
*NL*
rest
to
lie
on
the
stones
.
Nay
,
nay
,
I
'll
never
slip
my
neck
out
o
'
the
*NL*
yoke
,
and
leave
the
load
to
be
drawn
by
the
weak
uns
.
Father
's
a
sore
*NL*
cross
to
me
,
an
's
likely
to
be
for
many
a
long
year
to
come
.
What
then
?
*NL*
I
've
got
th
'
health
,
and
the
limbs
,
and
the
sperrit
to
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
a
smart
rap
,
as
if
with
a
willow
wand
,
was
given
at
the
*NL*
house
door
,
and
Gyp
,
instead
of
barking
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
*NL*
gave
a
loud
howl
.
Adam
,
very
much
startled
,
went
at
once
to
the
door
*NL*
and
opened
it
.
Nothing
was
there
;
all
was
still
,
as
when
he
opened
it
*NL*
an
hour
before
;
the
leaves
were
motionless
,
and
the
light
of
the
stars
*NL*
showed
the
placid
fields
on
both
sides
of
the
brook
quite
empty
of
*NL*
visible
life
.
Adam
walked
round
the
house
,
and
still
saw
nothing
except
*NL*
a
rat
which
darted
into
the
woodshed
as
he
passed
.
He
went
in
again
,
*NL*
wondering
;
the
sound
was
so
peculiar
that
the
moment
he
heard
it
it
*NL*
called
up
the
image
of
the
willow
wand
striking
the
door
.
He
could
not
*NL*
help
a
little
shudder
,
as
he
remembered
how
often
his
mother
had
told
*NL*
him
of
just
such
a
sound
coming
as
a
sign
when
some
one
was
dying
.
Adam
*NL*
was
not
a
man
to
be
gratuitously
superstitious
,
but
he
had
the
blood
of
*NL*
the
peasant
in
him
as
well
as
of
the
artisan
,
and
a
peasant
can
no
*NL*
more
help
believing
in
a
traditional
superstition
than
a
horse
can
help
*NL*
trembling
when
he
sees
a
camel
.
Besides
,
he
had
that
mental
combination
*NL*
which
is
at
once
humble
in
the
region
of
mystery
and
keen
in
the
region
*NL*
of
knowledge
:
it
was
the
depth
of
his
reverence
quite
as
much
as
*NL*
his
hard
common
sense
which
gave
him
his
disinclination
to
doctrinal
*NL*
religion
,
and
he
often
checked
Seth
's
argumentative
spiritualism
by
*NL*
saying
,
``
Eh
,
it
's
a
big
mystery
;
thee
know
`
st
but
little
about
it
.
''
And
*NL*
so
it
happened
that
Adam
was
at
once
penetrating
and
credulous
.
If
a
*NL*
new
building
had
fallen
down
and
he
had
been
told
that
this
was
a
divine
*NL*
judgment
,
he
would
have
said
,
``
May
be
;
but
the
bearing
o
'
the
roof
and
*NL*
walls
was
n't
right
,
else
it
would
n't
ha
'
come
down
''
;
yet
he
believed
*NL*
in
dreams
and
prognostics
,
and
to
his
dying
day
he
bated
his
breath
a
*NL*
little
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
stroke
with
the
willow
wand
.
I
*NL*
tell
it
as
he
told
it
,
not
attempting
to
reduce
it
to
its
natural
*NL*
elements
--
in
our
eagerness
to
explain
impressions
,
we
often
lose
our
*NL*
hold
of
the
sympathy
that
comprehends
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
the
best
antidote
against
imaginative
dread
in
the
necessity
*NL*
for
getting
on
with
the
coffin
,
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
his
hammer
*NL*
was
ringing
so
uninterruptedly
,
that
other
sounds
,
if
there
were
any
,
*NL*
might
well
be
overpowered
.
A
pause
came
,
however
,
when
he
had
to
take
*NL*
up
his
ruler
,
and
now
again
came
the
strange
rap
,
and
again
Gyp
howled
.
*NL*
Adam
was
at
the
door
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
;
but
again
all
was
*NL*
still
,
and
the
starlight
showed
there
was
nothing
but
the
dew-laden
*NL*
grass
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
for
a
moment
thought
uncomfortably
about
his
father
;
but
of
late
*NL*
years
he
had
never
come
home
at
dark
hours
from
Treddleston
,
and
*NL*
there
was
every
reason
for
believing
that
he
was
then
sleeping
off
his
*NL*
drunkenness
at
the
``
Waggon
Overthrown
.
''
Besides
,
to
Adam
,
the
conception
*NL*
of
the
future
was
so
inseparable
from
the
painful
image
of
his
father
*NL*
that
the
fear
of
any
fatal
accident
to
him
was
excluded
by
the
deeply
*NL*
infixed
fear
of
his
continual
degradation
.
The
next
thought
that
*NL*
occurred
to
him
was
one
that
made
him
slip
off
his
shoes
and
tread
*NL*
lightly
upstairs
,
to
listen
at
the
bedroom
doors
.
But
both
Seth
and
his
*NL*
mother
were
breathing
regularly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
came
down
and
set
to
work
again
,
saying
to
himself
,
``
I
wo
n't
open
*NL*
the
door
again
.
It
's
no
use
staring
about
to
catch
sight
of
a
sound
.
*NL*
Maybe
there
's
a
world
about
us
as
we
ca
n't
see
,
but
th
'
ear
's
quicker
*NL*
than
the
eye
and
catches
a
sound
from
'
t
now
and
then
.
Some
people
think
*NL*
they
get
a
sight
o
n't
too
,
but
they
're
mostly
folks
whose
eyes
are
not
*NL*
much
use
to
'em
at
anything
else
.
For
my
part
,
I
think
it
's
better
to
*NL*
see
when
your
perpendicular
's
true
than
to
see
a
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
thoughts
as
these
are
apt
to
grow
stronger
and
stronger
as
daylight
*NL*
quenches
the
candles
and
the
birds
begin
to
sing
.
By
the
time
the
red
*NL*
sunlight
shone
on
the
brass
nails
that
formed
the
initials
on
the
lid
of
*NL*
the
coffin
,
any
lingering
foreboding
from
the
sound
of
the
willow
*NL*
wand
was
merged
in
satisfaction
that
the
work
was
done
and
the
promise
*NL*
redeemed
.
There
was
no
need
to
call
Seth
,
for
he
was
already
moving
*NL*
overhead
,
and
presently
came
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
lad
,
''
said
Adam
,
as
Seth
made
his
appearance
,
``
the
coffin
's
done
,
*NL*
and
we
can
take
it
over
to
Brox
`
on
,
and
be
back
again
before
half
after
*NL*
six
.
I
'll
take
a
mouthful
o
'
oat-cake
,
and
then
we
'll
be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffin
was
soon
propped
on
the
tall
shoulders
of
the
two
brothers
,
*NL*
and
they
were
making
their
way
,
followed
close
by
Gyp
,
out
of
the
little
*NL*
woodyard
into
the
lane
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
It
was
but
about
a
mile
*NL*
and
a
half
to
Broxton
over
the
opposite
slope
,
and
their
road
wound
very
*NL*
pleasantly
along
lanes
and
across
fields
,
where
the
pale
woodbines
and
*NL*
the
dog-roses
were
scenting
the
hedgerows
,
and
the
birds
were
twittering
*NL*
and
trilling
in
the
tall
leafy
boughs
of
oak
and
elm
.
It
was
a
strangely
*NL*
mingled
picture
--
the
fresh
youth
of
the
summer
morning
,
with
its
*NL*
Edenlike
peace
and
loveliness
,
the
stalwart
strength
of
the
two
brothers
*NL*
in
their
rusty
working
clothes
,
and
the
long
coffin
on
their
shoulders
.
*NL*
They
paused
for
the
last
time
before
a
small
farmhouse
outside
the
*NL*
village
of
Broxton
.
By
six
o'clock
the
task
was
done
,
the
coffin
nailed
*NL*
down
,
and
Adam
and
Seth
were
on
their
way
home
.
They
chose
a
shorter
*NL*
way
homewards
,
which
would
take
them
across
the
fields
and
the
brook
in
*NL*
front
of
the
house
.
Adam
had
not
mentioned
to
Seth
what
had
happened
in
*NL*
the
night
,
but
he
still
retained
sufficient
impression
from
it
himself
*NL*
to
say
,
``
Seth
,
lad
,
if
Father
is
n't
come
home
by
the
time
we
've
had
our
*NL*
breakfast
,
I
think
it
'll
be
as
well
for
thee
to
go
over
to
Treddles
`
on
*NL*
and
look
after
him
,
and
thee
canst
get
me
the
brass
wire
I
want
.
Never
*NL*
mind
about
losing
an
hour
at
thy
work
;
we
can
make
that
up
.
What
dost
*NL*
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
But
see
what
clouds
have
gathered
since
we
*NL*
set
out
.
I
'm
thinking
we
shall
have
more
rain
.
It
'll
be
a
sore
time
for
*NL*
th
'
haymaking
if
the
meadows
are
flooded
again
.
The
brook
's
fine
and
*NL*
full
now
:
another
day
's
rain
`
ud
cover
the
plank
,
and
we
should
have
to
*NL*
go
round
by
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
coming
across
the
valley
now
,
and
had
entered
the
pasture
*NL*
through
which
the
brook
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
that
sticking
against
the
willow
?
''
continued
Seth
,
*NL*
beginning
to
walk
faster
.
Adam
's
heart
rose
to
his
mouth
:
the
vague
*NL*
anxiety
about
his
father
was
changed
into
a
great
dread
.
He
made
no
*NL*
answer
to
Seth
,
but
ran
forward
preceded
by
Gyp
,
who
began
to
bark
*NL*
uneasily
;
and
in
two
moments
he
was
at
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
what
the
omen
meant
,
then
!
And
the
grey-haired
father
,
of
whom
*NL*
he
had
thought
with
a
sort
of
hardness
a
few
hours
ago
,
as
certain
to
*NL*
live
to
be
a
thorn
in
his
side
was
perhaps
even
then
struggling
with
*NL*
that
watery
death
!
This
was
the
first
thought
that
flashed
through
*NL*
Adam
's
conscience
,
before
he
had
time
to
seize
the
coat
and
drag
out
*NL*
the
tall
heavy
body
.
Seth
was
already
by
his
side
,
helping
him
,
and
*NL*
when
they
had
it
on
the
bank
,
the
two
sons
in
the
first
moment
knelt
and
*NL*
looked
with
mute
awe
at
the
glazed
eyes
,
forgetting
that
there
was
need
*NL*
for
action
--
forgetting
everything
but
that
their
father
lay
dead
before
*NL*
them
.
Adam
was
the
first
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
to
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
loud
whisper
.
``
I
'll
be
back
to
thee
*NL*
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Lisbeth
was
busy
preparing
her
sons
'
breakfast
,
and
their
porridge
*NL*
was
already
steaming
on
the
fire
.
Her
kitchen
always
looked
the
pink
of
*NL*
cleanliness
,
but
this
morning
she
was
more
than
usually
bent
on
making
*NL*
her
hearth
and
breakfast-table
look
comfortable
and
inviting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lads
`
ull
be
fine
an
'
hungry
,
''
she
said
,
half-aloud
,
as
she
stirred
*NL*
the
porridge
.
``
It
's
a
good
step
to
Brox
`
on
,
an
'
it
's
hungry
air
o'er
*NL*
the
hill
--
wi
'
that
heavy
coffin
too
.
Eh
!
It
's
heavier
now
,
wi
'
poor
Bob
*NL*
Tholer

Howiver

I

.
The

Not
as
he
'll
ate
*NL*
much

layin

by

,
as
I
've
told
him
many
a
*NL*
time
,
an
'
am
likely
to
tell
him
again
afore
the
day
's
out
.
Eh
,
poor
mon
,
*NL*
he
takes
it
quiet
enough
;
there
's
no
denyin
'
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Lisbeth
heard
the
heavy
``
thud
''
of
a
running
footstep
on
the
*NL*
turf
,
and
,
turning
quickly
towards
the
door
,
she
saw
Adam
enter
,
looking
*NL*
so
pale
and
overwhelmed
that
she
screamed
aloud
and
rushed
towards
him
*NL*
before
he
had
time
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
Mother
,
''
Adam
said
,
rather
hoarsely
,
``
do
n't
be
frightened
.
*NL*
Father
's
tumbled
into
the
water
.
Belike
we
may
bring
him
round
again
.
*NL*
Seth
and
me
are
going
to
carry
him
in
.
Get
a
blanket
and
make
it
hot
as
*NL*
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
Adam
was
convinced
that
his
father
was
dead
but
he
knew
there
*NL*
was
no
other
way
of
repressing
his
mother
's
impetuous
wailing
grief
than
*NL*
by
occupying
her
with
some
active
task
which
had
hope
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
back
to
Seth
,
and
the
two
sons
lifted
the
sad
burden
in
*NL*
heart-stricken
silence
.
The
wide-open
glazed
eyes
were
grey
,
like
*NL*
Seth
's
,
and
had
once
looked
with
mild
pride
on
the
boys
before
whom
*NL*
Thias
had
lived
to
hang
his
head
in
shame
.
Seth
's
chief
feeling
was
awe
*NL*
and
distress
at
this
sudden
snatching
away
of
his
father
's
soul
;
but
*NL*
Adam
's
mind
rushed
back
over
the
past
in
a
flood
of
relenting
and
pity
.
*NL*
When
death
,
the
great
Reconciler
,
has
come
,
it
is
never
our
tenderness
*NL*
that
we
repent
of
,
but
our
severity
.

Chapter
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rector
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BEFORE
twelve
o'clock
there
had
been
some
heavy
storms
of
rain
,
and
the
*NL*
water
lay
in
deep
gutters
on
the
sides
of
the
gravel
walks
in
the
garden
*NL*
of
Broxton
Parsonage
;
the
great
Provence
roses
had
been
cruelly
tossed
*NL*
by
the
wind
and
beaten
by
the
rain
,
and
all
the
delicate-stemmed
border
*NL*
flowers
had
been
dashed
down
and
stained
with
the
wet
soil
.
A
melancholy
*NL*
morning
--
because
it
was
nearly
time
hay-harvest
should
begin
,
and
*NL*
instead
of
that
the
meadows
were
likely
to
be
flooded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
people
who
have
pleasant
homes
get
indoor
enjoyments
that
they
would
*NL*
never
think
of
but
for
the
rain
.
If
it
had
not
been
a
wet
morning
,
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
would
not
have
been
in
the
dining-room
playing
at
chess
with
his
*NL*
mother
,
and
he
loves
both
his
mother
and
chess
quite
well
enough
to
pass
*NL*
some
cloudy
hours
very
easily
by
their
help
.
Let
me
take
you
into
that
*NL*
dining-room
and
show
you
the
Rev.
Adolphus
Irwine
,
Rector
of
Broxton
,
*NL*
Vicar
of
Hayslope
,
and
Vicar
of
Blythe
,
a
pluralist
at
whom
the
severest
*NL*
Church
reformer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
look
sour
.
We
will
*NL*
enter
very
softly
and
stand
still
in
the
open
doorway
,
without
awaking
*NL*
the
glossy-brown
setter
who
is
stretched
across
the
hearth
,
with
her
*NL*
two
puppies
beside
her
;
or
the
pug
,
who
is
dozing
,
with
his
black
muzzle
*NL*
aloft
,
like
a
sleepy
president
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
is
a
large
and
lofty
one
,
with
an
ample
mullioned
oriel
window
*NL*
at
one
end
;
the
walls
,
you
see
,
are
new
,
and
not
yet
painted
;
but
the
*NL*
furniture
,
though
originally
of
an
expensive
sort
,
is
old
and
scanty
,
*NL*
and
there
is
no
drapery
about
the
window
.
The
crimson
cloth
over
the
*NL*
large
dining-table
is
very
threadbare
,
though
it
contrasts
pleasantly
*NL*
enough
with
the
dead
hue
of
the
plaster
on
the
walls
;
but
on
this
cloth
*NL*
there
is
a
massive
silver
waiter
with
a
decanter
of
water
on
it
,
of
the
*NL*
same
pattern
as
two
larger
ones
that
are
propped
up
on
the
sideboard
*NL*
with
a
coat
of
arms
conspicuous
in
their
centre
.
You
suspect
at
once
*NL*
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
room
have
inherited
more
blood
than
wealth
,
*NL*
and
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
a
finely
cut
*NL*
nostril
and
upper
lip
;
but
at
present
we
can
only
see
that
he
has
a
*NL*
broad
flat
back
and
an
abundance
of
powdered
hair
,
all
thrown
backward
*NL*
and
tied
behind
with
a
black
ribbon
--
a
bit
of
conservatism
in
costume
*NL*
which
tells
you
that
he
is
not
a
young
man
.
He
will
perhaps
turn
round
*NL*
by
and
by
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
can
look
at
that
stately
old
lady
,
his
*NL*
mother
,
a
beautiful
aged
brunette
,
whose
rich-toned
complexion
is
well
*NL*
set
off
by
the
complex
wrappings
of
pure
white
cambric
and
lace
about
*NL*
her
head
and
neck
.
She
is
as
erect
in
her
comely
embonpoint
as
a
statue
*NL*
of
Ceres
;
and
her
dark
face
,
with
its
delicate
aquiline
nose
,
firm
proud
*NL*
mouth
,
and
small
,
intense
,
black
eye
,
is
so
keen
and
sarcastic
in
its
*NL*
expression
that
you
instinctively
substitute
a
pack
of
cards
for
the
*NL*
chess-men
and
imagine
her
telling
your
fortune
.
The
small
brown
hand
*NL*
with
which
she
is
lifting
her
queen
is
laden
with
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
*NL*
turquoises
;
and
a
large
black
veil
is
very
carefully
adjusted
over
the
*NL*
crown
of
her
cap
,
and
falls
in
sharp
contrast
on
the
white
folds
*NL*
about
her
neck
.
It
must
take
a
long
time
to
dress
that
old
lady
in
the
*NL*
morning
!
But
it
seems
a
law
of
nature
that
she
should
be
dressed
so
:
she
*NL*
is
clearly
one
of
those
children
of
royalty
who
have
never
doubted
their
*NL*
right
divine
and
never
met
with
any
one
so
absurd
as
to
question
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Dauphin
,
tell
me
what
that
is
!
''
says
this
magnificent
old
lady
,
*NL*
as
she
deposits
her
queen
very
quietly
and
folds
her
arms
.
``
I
should
be
*NL*
sorry
to
utter
a
word
disagreeable
to
your
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
witch-mother
,
you
sorceress
!
How
is
a
Christian
man
to
win
a
*NL*
game
off
you
?
I
should
have
sprinkled
the
board
with
holy
water
before
*NL*
we
began
.
You
've
not
won
that
game
by
fair
means
,
now
,
so
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
what
the
beaten
have
always
said
of
great
conquerors
.
*NL*
But
see
,
there
's
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
board
,
to
show
you
more
*NL*
clearly
what
a
foolish
move
you
made
with
that
pawn
.
Come
,
shall
I
give
*NL*
you
another
chance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mother
,
I
shall
leave
you
to
your
own
conscience

now
it
's
clearing
*NL*
up

We
must
go
and
plash
up
the
mud
a
little

''
This
*NL*
was
addressed
to
the
brown
setter
,
who
had
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
voices
and
laid
her
nose
in
an
insinuating
way
on
her
master
's
leg
.
``
But
*NL*
I
must
go
upstairs
first
and
see
Anne
.
I
was
called
away
to
Tholer
's
*NL*
funeral
just
when
I
was
going
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
of
no

she
ca

Kate
says

of
*NL*
her
worst
headaches

morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
likes
me
to
go
and
see

just
the
same

never

to

about

''
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
know
how
much
of
human
speech
is
mere
purposeless
impulse
or
*NL*
habit
,
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
tell
you
that
this
identical
objection
*NL*
had
been
made
,
and
had
received
the
same
kind
of
answer
,
many
hundred
*NL*
times
in
the
course
of
the
fifteen
years
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
sister
Anne
*NL*
had
been
an
invalid
.
Splendid
old
ladies
,
who
take
a
long
time
to
dress
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
have
often
slight
sympathy
with
sickly
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
Mr.
Irwine
was
still
seated
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
*NL*
stroking
Juno
's
head
,
the
servant
came
to
the
door
and
said
,
``
If
*NL*
you
please
,
sir
,
Joshua
Rann
wishes
to
speak
with

if
you
are

liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
be
shown
in
here
,
''
said
Mrs.
Irwine
,
taking
up
her
knitting
.
*NL*
``
I
always
like
to
hear
what
Mr.
Rann
has
got
to
say
.
His
shoes
will
be
*NL*
dirty
,
but
see
that
he
wipes
them
Carroll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
minutes
Mr.
Rann
appeared
at
the
door
with
very
deferential
bows
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
were
far
from
conciliating
Pug
,
who
gave
a
sharp
bark
*NL*
and
ran
across
the
room
to
reconnoitre
the
stranger
's
legs
;
while
the
*NL*
two
puppies
,
regarding
Mr.
Rann
's
prominent
calf
and
ribbed
worsted
*NL*
stockings
from
a
more
sensuous
point
of
view
,
plunged
and
growled
over
*NL*
them
in
great
enjoyment
.
Meantime
,
Mr.
Irwine
turned
round
his
chair
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Well
,
Joshua
,
anything
the
matter
at
Hayslope
,
that
you
've
come
*NL*
over
this
damp
morning
?
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
Never
mind
the
dogs
;
give
*NL*
them
a
friendly
kick
.
Here
,
Pug
,
you
rascal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
pleasant
to
see
some
men
turn
round
;
pleasant
as
a
sudden
*NL*
rush
of
warm
air
in
winter
,
or
the
flash
of
firelight
in
the
chill
dusk
.
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
was
one
of
those
men
.
He
bore
the
same
sort
of
resemblance
to
*NL*
his
mother
that
our
loving
memory
of
a
friend
's
face
often
bears
to
the
*NL*
face
itself
:
the
lines
were
all
more
generous
,
the
smile
brighter
,
the
*NL*
expression
heartier
.
If
the
outline
had
been
less
finely
cut
,
his
face
*NL*
might
have
been
called
jolly
;
but
that
was
not
the
right
word
for
its
*NL*
mixture
of
bonhomie
and
distinction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
Your
Reverence
,
''
answered
Mr.
Rann
,
endeavouring
to
look
*NL*
unconcerned
about
his
legs
,
but
shaking
them
alternately
to
keep
off
the
*NL*
puppies
;
``
I
'll
stand
,
if
you
please

as
more
becoming

half-masculine
tone

there

entered
a
young

in
a
riding-dress

with

arm
in

a

followed
that
pleasant
confusion
of
laughing
*NL*
interjections

and
hand-shakings
,
and
``
How
are

mingled
with
*NL*
joyous
short
barks
and
wagging
of
tails
on
the
part

canine
*NL*
members
of
the
family
,
which
tells
that
the
visitor
is
on
the
best
terms
*NL*
with

visited

The
young
gentleman
was
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
known

in
Hayslope

variously
,
as
``
the
young
squire
,
''
``
the
heir

''
and
``
the
*NL*
captain

He
was
only
a
captain
in
the
Loamshire
Militia
,
but
to
the
*NL*
Hayslope
tenants
he
was
more
intensely
a
captain
than
all
the
young
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
same
rank
in
his
Majesty
's
regulars
--
he
outshone
them
*NL*
as
the
planet
Jupiter
outshines
the
Milky
Way

If
you
want
to
know
*NL*
more
particularly
how
he
looked
,
call
to
your
remembrance
some
*NL*
tawny-whiskered
,
brown-locked
,
clear-complexioned
young
Englishman
*NL*
whom
you
have
met
with
in

foreign
town
,
and
been
proud
of
as
a
*NL*
fellow-countryman
--
well-washed
,
high-bred
,
white-handed
,
yet
looking
as
*NL*
if
he
could
deliver
well
from

the
left
shoulder
and
floor
his
man
:
I
*NL*
will
not
be
so
much
of
a
tailor
as
to
trouble
your
imagination
with
the
*NL*
difference
of
costume

and
insist
on
the
striped
waistcoat
,
long-tailed
*NL*
coat
,
and
low
top-boots

*NL*
*NL*
Turning
round
to
take
a
chair
,
Captain
Donnithorne
said
,
``

Mr.

when
Joshua
was
gone

``
I
'm
afraid

the

I
should
have
been
glad
for
the
*NL*
load
to
have
been
taken
off
my
friend
Adam
's
shoulders
in
a
less
painful
*NL*
way
.
That
fine
fellow
has
been
propping
up
his
father
from
ruin
for
the
*NL*
last
five

six
years

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
regular

said
Captain
Donnithorne
.
``
When
I
was
*NL*
a
little
fellow
,
and
Adam
was
a
strapping
lad
of
fifteen
,
and
taught
me
*NL*
carpentering
,
I
used
to
think
if
ever
I
was
a
rich
sultan
,
I
would
make
*NL*
Adam
my
grand-vizier
.
And
I
believe
now
he
would
bear
the
exaltation
as
*NL*
well
as
any
poor
wise
man
in
an
Eastern
story
.
If
ever
I
live
to
be
a
*NL*
large-acred
man
instead
of
a
poor
devil
with
a
mortgaged
allowance
of
*NL*
pocket-money
,
I
'll
have
Adam
for
my
right
hand
.
He
shall
manage
my
woods
*NL*
for
me
,
for
he
seems
to
have
a
better
notion
of
those
things
than
any
*NL*
man
I
ever
met
with
;
and
I
know
he
would
make
twice
the
money
of
them
*NL*
that
my
grandfather
does
,
with
that
miserable
old
Satchell
to
manage
,
*NL*
who
understands
no
more
about
timber
than
an
old
carp

I
've
mentioned
*NL*
the
subject
to
my
grandfather
once
or
twice
,
but
for
some
reason
or
*NL*
other
he
has
a
dislike
to
Adam
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
.
But
come
,
Your
*NL*
Reverence
,
are
you
for
a
ride
with
me
?
It
's
splendid
out
of
doors
now
.
*NL*
We
can
go
to
Adam
's
together
,
if
you
like
;
but
I
want
to
call
at
the
*NL*
Hall
Farm
on
my
way
,
to
look
at
the
whelps
Poyser
is
keeping
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

Arthur

to
go

said
Mr.

``
to
have
another
*NL*
look
at
the
little
Methodist
who
is
staying
there

Joshua
tells
me
she
*NL*
was
preaching
on
the
Green
last
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
Jove
!
''
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
laughing
.
``
Why
,
she
looks
as
*NL*
quiet
as
a
mouse
.
There
's
something
rather
striking
about
her
,
though
.
I
*NL*
positively
felt
quite
bashful
the
first
time
I
saw
her
--
she
was
sitting
*NL*
stooping
over
her
sewing
in
the
sunshine
outside
the
house
,
when
I
rode
*NL*
up
and
called
out
,
without
noticing
that
she
was
a
stranger
,
`
Is
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
at
home
?
'
I
declare
,
when
she
got
up
and
looked
at
me

just
*NL*
said
,
`
He
's
in
the
house
,
I
believe
:
I
'll
go
and
call
him
,
'
I
felt
*NL*
quite
ashamed
of
having
spoken
so
abruptly
to
her
.
She
looked
like
St.
*NL*
Catherine
in
a
Quaker
dress
.
It
's
a
type
of
face
one
rarely
sees
among
*NL*
our
common
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
the
young
woman

Dauphin

said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
``
Make
*NL*
her
come
here
on
some
pretext
or
other

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
I
can
manage
that
,
Mother
;
it
will
hardly
do
for
me
*NL*
to
patronize
a
Methodist
preacher
,
even
if
she
would
consent
to
be
*NL*
patronized
by
an
idle
shepherd
,
as
Will
Maskery
calls
me
.
You
should
*NL*
have
come
in
a
little
sooner
,
Arthur
,
to
hear
Joshua
's
denunciation
of
*NL*
his
neighbour
Will
Maskery
.
The
old
fellow
wants
me
to
excommunicate
the
*NL*
wheelwright
,
and
then
deliver
him
over
to
the
civil
arm
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
to
your
grandfather
--
to
be
turned
out
of
house
and
yard
.
If
I
chose
to
*NL*
interfere
in
this
business
,
now
,
I
might
get
up
as
pretty
a
story
of
*NL*
hatred
and
persecution
as
the
Methodists
need
desire
to
publish
in
*NL*
the
next
number
of
their
magazine
.
It
would
n't
take
me
much
trouble
to
*NL*
persuade
Chad
Cranage
and
half
a
dozen
other
bull-headed
fellows
that
*NL*
they
would
be
doing
an
acceptable
service
to
the
Church
by
hunting
Will
*NL*
Maskery
out
of
the
village
with
rope-ends
and
pitchforks
;
and
then
,
when
*NL*
I
had
furnished
them
with
half
a
sovereign
to
get
gloriously
drunk
after
*NL*
their
exertions
,
I
should
have
put
the
climax
to
as
pretty
a
farce
as
*NL*
any
of
my
brother
clergy
have
set
going
in
their
parishes
for
the
last
*NL*
thirty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
really
insolent
of
the

call
you
an

idle
*NL*
shepherd

a
`
dumb
dog

said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

you
do

would
be
a
good
way
of
sustaining
my
*NL*
dignity
to
set
about
vindicating
myself
from
the
aspersions
of
Will
*NL*
Maskery

Besides
,
I
'm
not
so
sure
that
they
ARE
aspersions

I
AM
a
lazy

get
terribly
heavy
in

not
to
mention
that
I
'm
*NL*
always
spending
more
than
I
can
afford
in
bricks

mortar

so
that

I
get
savage
at
a
lame
beggar
when
he
asks
me
for
sixpence

Those
poor

lean
cobblers

who
think
they

regenerate
mankind

setting
*NL*
out
to
preach
in
the
morning
twilight
before
they
begin
their
day

*NL*
work

may
well
have
a
poor
opinion

luncheon

Mr.

Irwine
continued
,
observing
that
Captain
Donnithorne
had
taken
his
arm
*NL*
out
of
the
sling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

pretty
well

up
constantly

I
hope
I
shall
be
able
to
get
away
to
the
regiment

*NL*
though

in

beginning

August

It
's
a
desperately

shut
up

neither

make

pleasantly
sleepy
in

evening

However

we
are
to
astonish
the
echoes
on
the
30th
of

given
me
carte

I
promise

shall
be
worthy

rather
two

one
on

down

``
Ah

I
think
I
shall
see

mother
flitting
about
in
her
white
dress

which
looked
to
me
almost
like
*NL*
a
shroud
that
very
day
;
and
it
WAS
her
shroud
only
three
months
after
;
*NL*
and
your

were
buried

two

Talking

,
``
that
reminds
me
that
I

I
meant

came
down
in
a
parcel
from
*NL*
London
the
other

I
know
you
are
fond
of
queer
,
wizardlike
stories

*NL*
It
's
a
volume
of
poems

`
Lyrical

'
Most
of
them
seem
to
be

twaddling
stuff

but
the
first
is
in
a
different

I
can
hardly
make
head

tail
of
it

it
's

it
over

look
at

*NL*
*NL*
The
little
matter
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
to
attend
to
took
him
up
the
old
*NL*
stone
staircase
-LRB-
part
of
the
house
was
very
old
-RRB-
and
made
him
pause
*NL*
before
a
door
at
which
he
knocked
gently
.
``
Come
in
,
''
said
a
woman
's
*NL*
voice
,
and
he
entered
a
room
so
darkened
by
blinds
and
curtains
that
*NL*
Miss
Kate
,
the
thin
middle-aged
lady
standing
by
the
bedside
,
would
not
*NL*
have
had
light
enough
for
any
other
sort
of
work
than
the
knitting
which
*NL*
lay
on
the
little
table
near
her
.
But
at
present
she
was
doing
what
*NL*
required
only
the
dimmest
light
--
sponging
the
aching
head
that
lay
on
*NL*
the
pillow
with
fresh
vinegar
.
It
was
a
small
face
,
that
of
the
poor
*NL*
sufferer
;
perhaps
it
had
once
been
pretty
,
but
now
it
was
worn
and
*NL*
sallow
.
Miss
Kate
came
towards
her
brother
and
whispered
,
``
Do
n't
speak
*NL*
to
her
;
she
ca
n't
bear
to
be
spoken
to
to-day

*NL*
and
her
brow
contracted
as
if
from
intense
pain
.
Mr.
Irwine
went
to
the
*NL*
bedside
and
took
up
one
of
the
delicate
hands
and
kissed
it
,
a
slight
*NL*
pressure
from
the
small
fingers
told
him
that
it
was
worth-while
to
have
*NL*
come
upstairs
for
the
sake
of
doing
that
.
He
lingered
a
moment
,
looking
*NL*
at
her
,
and
then
turned
away
and
left
the
room
,
treading
very
gently
--
he
*NL*
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
put
on
slippers
before
he
came
upstairs
.
*NL*
Whoever
remembers
how
many
things
he
has
declined
to
do
even
for
*NL*
himself
,
rather
than
have
the
trouble
of
putting
on
or
taking
off
his
*NL*
boots
,
will
not
think
this
last
detail
insignificant
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mr.
Irwine
's
sisters
,
as
any
person
of
family
within
ten
miles
of
*NL*
Broxton
could
have
testified
,
were
such
stupid
,
uninteresting
women
!
*NL*
It
was
quite
a
pity
handsome
,
clever
Mrs.
Irwine
should
have
had
such
*NL*
commonplace
daughters
.
That
fine
old
lady
herself
was
worth
driving
ten
*NL*
miles
to
see
,
any
day
;
her
beauty
,
her
well-preserved
faculties
,
and
her
*NL*
old-fashioned
dignity
made
her
a
graceful
subject
for
conversation
in
*NL*
turn
with
the
King
's
health
,
the
sweet
new
patterns
in
cotton
dresses
,
*NL*
the
news
from
Egypt
,
and
Lord
Dacey
's
lawsuit
,
which
was
fretting
poor
*NL*
Lady
Dacey
to
death
.
But
no
one
ever
thought
of
mentioning
the
Miss
*NL*
Irwines
,
except
the
poor
people
in
Broxton
village
,
who
regarded
them
*NL*
as
deep
in
the
science
of
medicine
,
and
spoke
of
them
vaguely
as
``
the
*NL*
gentlefolks
.
''
If
any
one
had
asked
old
Job
Dummilow
who
gave
him
his
*NL*
flannel
jacket
,
he
would
have
answered
,
``
the
gentlefolks
,
last
*NL*
winter
''
;
and
widow
Steene
dwelt
much
on
the
virtues
of
the
``
stuff
''
the
*NL*
gentlefolks
gave
her
for
her
cough
.
Under
this
name
too
,
they
were
used
*NL*
with
great
effect
as
a
means
of
taming
refractory
children
,
so
that
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
poor
Miss
Anne
's
sallow
face
,
several
small
urchins
had
a
*NL*
terrified
sense
that
she
was
cognizant
of
all
their
worst
misdemeanours
,
*NL*
and
knew
the
precise
number
of
stones
with
which
they
had
intended
to
*NL*
hit
Farmer
Britton
's
ducks
.
But
for
all
who
saw
them
through
a
*NL*
less
mythical
medium
,
the
Miss
Irwines
were
quite
superfluous
*NL*
existences
--
inartistic
figures
crowding
the
canvas
of
life
without
*NL*
adequate
effect
.
Miss
Anne
,
indeed
,
if
her
chronic
headaches
could
have
*NL*
been
accounted
for
by
a
pathetic
story
of
disappointed
love
,
might
have
*NL*
had
some
romantic
interest
attached
to
her
:
but
no
such
story
had
either
*NL*
been
known
or
invented
concerning
her
,
and
the
general
impression
was
*NL*
quite
in
accordance
with
the
fact
,
that
both
the
sisters
were
old
maids
*NL*
for
the
prosaic
reason
that
they
had
never
received
an
eligible
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
to
speak
paradoxically
,
the
existence
of
insignificant
*NL*
people
has
very
important
consequences
in
the
world
.
It
can
be
shown
to
*NL*
affect
the
price
of
bread
and
the
rate
of
wages
,
to
call
forth
many
evil
*NL*
tempers
from
the
selfish
and
many
heroisms
from
the
sympathetic
,
and
,
*NL*
in
other
ways
,
to
play
no
small
part
in
the
tragedy
of
life
.
And
if
that
*NL*
handsome
,
generous-blooded
clergyman
,
the
Rev.
Adolphus
Irwine
,
had
not
*NL*
had
these
two
hopelessly
maiden
sisters
,
his
lot
would
have
been
shaped
*NL*
quite
differently
:
he
would
very
likely
have
taken
a
comely
wife
in
his
*NL*
youth
,
and
now
,
when
his
hair
was
getting
grey
under
the
powder
,
would
*NL*
have
had
tall
sons
and
blooming
daughters
--
such
possessions
,
in
short
,
*NL*
as
men
commonly
think
will
repay
them
for
all
the
labour
they
take
under
*NL*
the
sun
.
As
it
was
--
having
with
all
his
three
livings
no
more
than
seven
*NL*
hundred
a-year
,
and
seeing
no
way
of
keeping
his
splendid
mother
and
his
*NL*
sickly
sister
,
not
to
reckon
a
second
sister
,
who
was
usually
spoken
of
*NL*
without
any
adjective
,
in
such
ladylike
ease
as
became
their
birth
*NL*
and
habits
,
and
at
the
same
time
providing
for
a
family
of
his
own
--
he
*NL*
remained
,
you
see
,
at
the
age
of
eight-and-forty
,
a
bachelor
,
not
*NL*
making
any
merit
of
that
renunciation
,
but
saying
laughingly
,
if
any
one
*NL*
alluded
to
it
,
that
he
made
it
an
excuse
for
many
indulgences
which
a
*NL*
wife
would
never
have
allowed
him
.
And
perhaps
he
was
the
only
person
in
*NL*
the
world
who
did
not
think
his
sisters
uninteresting
and
superfluous
;
*NL*
for
his
was
one
of
those
large-hearted
,
sweet-blooded
natures
that
never
*NL*
know
a
narrow
or
a
grudging
thought
;
Epicurean
,
if
you
will
,
with
no
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
no
self-scourging
sense
of
duty
;
but
yet
,
as
you
have
seen
,
*NL*
of
a
sufficiently
subtle
moral
fibre
to
have
an
unwearying
tenderness
*NL*
for
obscure
and
monotonous
suffering
.
It
was
his
large-hearted
*NL*
indulgence
that
made
him
ignore
his
mother
's
hardness
towards
her
*NL*
daughters
,
which
was
the
more
striking
from
its
contrast
with
her
doting
*NL*
fondness
towards
himself
;
he
held
it
no
virtue
to
frown
at
irremediable
*NL*
faults
.
*NL*
*NL*
See
the
difference
between
the
impression
a
man
makes
on
you
when
you
*NL*
walk
by
his
side
in
familiar
talk
,
or
look
at
him
in
his
home
,
and
the
*NL*
figure
he
makes
when
seen
from
a
lofty
historical
level
,
or
even
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
a
critical
neighbour
who
thinks
of
him
as
an
embodied
system
*NL*
or
opinion
rather
than
as
a
man
.
Mr.
Roe
,
the
``
travelling
preacher
''
*NL*
stationed
at
Treddleston
,
had
included
Mr.
Irwine
in
a
general
statement
*NL*
concerning
the
Church
clergy
in
the
surrounding
district
,
whom
he
*NL*
described
as
men
given
up
to
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
and
the
pride
of
*NL*
life
;
hunting
and
shooting
,
and
adorning
their
own
houses
;
asking
what
*NL*
shall
we
eat
,
and
what
shall
we
drink
,
and
wherewithal
shall
we
be
*NL*
clothed
?
--
careless
of
dispensing
the
bread
of
life
to
their
flocks
,
*NL*
preaching
at
best
but
a
carnal
and
soul-benumbing
morality
,
and
*NL*
trafficking
in
the
souls
of
men
by
receiving
money
for
discharging
the
*NL*
pastoral
office
in
parishes
where
they
did
not
so
much
as
look
on
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
people
more
than
once
a-year
.
The
ecclesiastical
historian
,
*NL*
too
,
looking
into
parliamentary
reports
of
that
period
,
finds
honourable
*NL*
members
zealous
for
the
Church
,
and
untainted
with
any
sympathy
for
*NL*
the
``
tribe
of
canting
Methodists
,
''
making
statements
scarcely
less
*NL*
melancholy
than
that
of
Mr.
Roe
.
And
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
that
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
was
altogether
belied
by
the
generic
classification
assigned
*NL*
him
.
He
really
had
no
very
lofty
aims
,
no
theological
enthusiasm
:
if
I
*NL*
were
closely
questioned
,
I
should
be
obliged
to
confess
that
he
felt
*NL*
no
serious
alarms
about
the
souls
of
his
parishioners
,
and
would
have
*NL*
thought
it
a
mere
loss
of
time
to
talk
in
a
doctrinal
and
awakening
*NL*
manner
to
old
``
Feyther
Taft
,
''
or
even
to
Chad
Cranage
the
blacksmith
.
*NL*
If
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
speaking
theoretically
,
he
would
perhaps
*NL*
have
said
that
the
only
healthy
form
religion
could
take
in
such
minds
*NL*
was
that
of
certain
dim
but
strong
emotions
,
suffusing
themselves
as
a
*NL*
hallowing
influence
over
the
family
affections
and
neighbourly
duties
.
*NL*
He
thought
the
custom
of
baptism
more
important
than
its
doctrine
,
and
*NL*
that
the
religious
benefits
the
peasant
drew
from
the
church
where
his
*NL*
fathers
worshipped
and
the
sacred
piece
of
turf
where
they
lay
buried
*NL*
were
but
slightly
dependent
on
a
clear
understanding
of
the
Liturgy
or
*NL*
the
sermon
.
Clearly
the
rector
was
not
what
is
called
in
these
days
an
*NL*
``
earnest
''
man
:
he
was
fonder
of
church
history
than
of
divinity
,
and
had
*NL*
much
more
insight
into
men
's
characters
than
interest
in
their
opinions
;
*NL*
he
was
neither
laborious
,
nor
obviously
self-denying
,
nor
very
copious
*NL*
in
alms-giving
,
and
his
theology
,
you
perceive
,
was
lax
.
His
mental
*NL*
palate
,
indeed
,
was
rather
pagan
,
and
found
a
savouriness
in
a
quotation
*NL*
from
Sophocles
or
Theocritus
that
was
quite
absent
from
any
text
in
*NL*
Isaiah
or
Amos
.
But
if
you
feed
your
young
setter
on
raw
flesh
,
how
*NL*
can
you
wonder
at
its
retaining
a
relish
for
uncooked
partridge
in
*NL*
after-life
?
And
Mr.
Irwine
's
recollections
of
young
enthusiasm
and
*NL*
ambition
were
all
associated
with
poetry
and
ethics
that
lay
aloof
from
*NL*
the
Bible
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
I
must
plead
,
for
I
have
an
affectionate
partiality
*NL*
towards
the
rector
's
memory
,
that
he
was
not
vindictive
--
and
some
*NL*
philanthropists
have
been
so
;
that
he
was
not
intolerant
--
and
there
is
a
*NL*
rumour
that
some
zealous
theologians
have
not
been
altogether
free
from
*NL*
that
blemish
;
that
although
he
would
probably
have
declined
to
give
his
*NL*
body
to
be
burned
in
any
public
cause
,
and
was
far
from
bestowing
all
*NL*
his
goods
to
feed
the
poor
,
he
had
that
charity
which
has
sometimes
*NL*
been
lacking
to
very
illustrious
virtue
--
he
was
tender
to
other
men
's
*NL*
failings
,
and
unwilling
to
impute
evil
.
He
was
one
of
those
men
,
*NL*
and
they
are
not
the
commonest
,
of
whom
we
can
know
the
best
only
by
*NL*
following
them
away
from
the
marketplace
,
the
platform
,
and
the
pulpit
,
*NL*
entering
with
them
into
their
own
homes
,
hearing
the
voice
with
which
*NL*
they
speak
to
the
young
and
aged
about
their
own
hearthstone
,
and
*NL*
witnessing
their
thoughtful
care
for
the
everyday
wants
of
everyday
*NL*
companions
,
who
take
all
their
kindness
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
not
*NL*
as
a
subject
for
panegyric
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
men
,
happily
,
have
lived
in
times
when
great
abuses
flourished
,
and
*NL*
have
sometimes
even
been
the
living
representatives
of
the
abuses
.
*NL*
That
is
a
thought
which
might
comfort
us
a
little
under
the
opposite
*NL*
fact
--
that
it
is
better
sometimes
NOT
to
follow
great
reformers
of
*NL*
abuses
beyond
the
threshold
of
their
homes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
you
may
think
of
Mr.
Irwine
now
,
if
you
had
met
him
that
*NL*
June
afternoon
riding
on
his
grey
cob
,
with
his
dogs
running
beside
*NL*
him
--
portly
,
upright
,
manly
,
with
a
good-natured
smile
on
his
finely
*NL*
turned
lips
as
he
talked
to
his
dashing
young
companion
on
the
bay
mare
,
*NL*
you
must
have
felt
that
,
however
ill
he
harmonized
with
sound
theories
*NL*
of
the
clerical
office
,
he
somehow
harmonized
extremely
well
with
that
*NL*
peaceful
landscape
.
*NL*
*NL*
See
them
in
the
bright
sunlight
,
interrupted
every
now
and
then
by
*NL*
rolling
masses
of
cloud
,
ascending
the
slope
from
the
Broxton
side
,
*NL*
where
the
tall
gables
and
elms
of
the
rectory
predominate
over
the
tiny
*NL*
whitewashed
church
.
They
will
soon
be
in
the
parish
of
Hayslope
;
the
*NL*
grey
church-tower
and
village
roofs
lie
before
them
to
the
left
,
and
*NL*
farther
on
,
to
the
right
,
they
can
just
see
the
chimneys
of
the
Hall
*NL*
Farm
.

Chapter
VI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hall
Farm
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EVIDENTLY
that
gate
is
never
opened
,
for
the
long
grass
and
the
great
*NL*
hemlocks
grow
close
against
it
,
and
if
it
were
opened
,
it
is
so
rusty
*NL*
that
the
force
necessary
to
turn
it
on
its
hinges
would
be
likely
to
*NL*
pull
down
the
square
stone-built
pillars
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
two
*NL*
stone
lionesses
which
grin
with
a
doubtful
carnivorous
affability
above
*NL*
a
coat
of
arms
surmounting
each
of
the
pillars
.
It
would
be
easy
enough
,
*NL*
by
the
aid
of
the
nicks
in
the
stone
pillars
,
to
climb
over
the
brick
*NL*
wall
with
its
smooth
stone
coping
;
but
by
putting
our
eyes
close
to
the
*NL*
rusty
bars
of
the
gate
,
we
can
see
the
house
well
enough
,
and
all
but
*NL*
the
very
corners
of
the
grassy
enclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
fine
old
place
,
of
red
brick
,
softened
by
a
pale
powdery
*NL*
lichen
,
which
has
dispersed
itself
with
happy
irregularity
,
so
as
*NL*
to
bring
the
red
brick
into
terms
of
friendly
companionship
with
the
*NL*
limestone
ornaments
surrounding
the
three
gables
,
the
windows
,
and
the
*NL*
door-place
.
But
the
windows
are
patched
with
wooden
panes
,
and
the
door
,
*NL*
I
think
,
is
like
the
gate
--
it
is
never
opened
.
How
it
would
groan
and
*NL*
grate
against
the
stone
floor
if
it
were
!
For
it
is
a
solid
,
heavy
,
*NL*
handsome
door
,
and
must
once
have
been
in
the
habit
of
shutting
with
a
*NL*
sonorous
bang
behind
a
liveried
lackey
,
who
had
just
seen
his
master
and
*NL*
mistress
off
the
grounds
in
a
carriage
and
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
present
one
might
fancy
the
house
in
the
early
stage
of
a
*NL*
chancery
suit
,
and
that
the
fruit
from
that
grand
double
row
of
*NL*
walnut-trees
on
the
right
hand
of
the
enclosure
would
fall
and
rot
among
*NL*
the
grass
,
if
it
were
not
that
we
heard
the
booming
bark
of
dogs
echoing
*NL*
from
great
buildings
at
the
back
.
And
now
the
half-weaned
calves
that
*NL*
have
been
sheltering
themselves
in
a
gorse-built
hovel
against
the
*NL*
left-hand
wall
come
out
and
set
up
a
silly
answer
to
that
terrible
bark
,
*NL*
doubtless
supposing
that
it
has
reference
to
buckets
of
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
house
must
be
inhabited
,
and
we
will
see
by
whom
;
for
*NL*
imagination
is
a
licensed
trespasser
:
it
has
no
fear
of
dogs
,
but
may
*NL*
climb
over
walls
and
peep
in
at
windows
with
impunity
.
Put
your
face
*NL*
to
one
of
the
glass
panes
in
the
right-hand
window
:
what
do
you
see
?
A
*NL*
large
open
fireplace
,
with
rusty
dogs
in
it
,
and
a
bare
boarded
floor
;
*NL*
at
the
far
end
,
fleeces
of
wool
stacked
up
;
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
*NL*
some
empty
corn-bags
.
That
is
the
furniture
of
the
dining-room
.
And
*NL*
what
through
the
left-hand
window
?
Several
clothes-horses
,
a
pillion
,
*NL*
a
spinning-wheel
,
and
an
old
box
wide
open
and
stuffed
full
of
coloured
*NL*
rags
.
At
the
edge
of
this
box
there
lies
a
great
wooden
doll
,
which
,
so
*NL*
far
as
mutilation
is
concerned
,
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
finest
*NL*
Greek
sculpture
,
and
especially
in
the
total
loss
of
its
nose
.
Near
it
*NL*
there
is
a
little
chair
,
and
the
butt
end
of
a
boy
's
leather
long-lashed
*NL*
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
the
house
is
plain
now
.
It
was
once
the
residence
of
*NL*
a
country
squire
,
whose
family
,
probably
dwindling
down
to
mere
*NL*
spinsterhood
,
got
merged
in
the
more
territorial
name
of
Donnithorne
.
It
*NL*
was
once
the
Hall
;
it
is
now
the
Hall
Farm
.
Like
the
life
in
some
*NL*
coast
town
that
was
once
a
watering-place
,
and
is
now
a
port
,
where
the
*NL*
genteel
streets
are
silent
and
grass-grown
,
and
the
docks
and
warehouses
*NL*
busy
and
resonant
,
the
life
at
the
Hall
has
changed
its
focus
,
and
no
*NL*
longer
radiates
from
the
parlour
,
but
from
the
kitchen
and
the
farmyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Plenty
of
life
there
,
though
this
is
the
drowsiest
time
of
the
year
,
*NL*
just
before
hay-harvest
;
and
it
is
the
drowsiest
time
of
the
day
too
,
*NL*
for
it
is
close
upon
three
by
the
sun
,
and
it
is
half-past
three
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
's
handsome
eight-day
clock
.
But
there
is
always
a
stronger
sense
*NL*
of
life
when
the
sun
is
brilliant
after
rain
;
and
now
he
is
pouring
*NL*
down
his
beams
,
and
making
sparkles
among
the
wet
straw
,
and
lighting
*NL*
up
every
patch
of
vivid
green
moss
on
the
red
tiles
of
the
cow-shed
,
and
*NL*
turning
even
the
muddy
water
that
is
hurrying
along
the
channel
to
the
*NL*
drain
into
a
mirror
for
the
yellow-billed
ducks
,
who
are
seizing
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
getting
a
drink
with
as
much
body
in
it
as
possible
.
*NL*
There
is
quite
a
concert
of
noises
;
the
great
bull-dog
,
chained
against
*NL*
the
stables
,
is
thrown
into
furious
exasperation
by
the
unwary
approach
*NL*
of
a
cock
too
near
the
mouth
of
his
kennel
,
and
sends
forth
a
thundering
*NL*
bark
,
which
is
answered
by
two
fox-hounds
shut
up
in
the
opposite
*NL*
cow-house
;
the
old
top-knotted
hens
,
scratching
with
their
chicks
among
*NL*
the
straw
,
set
up
a
sympathetic
croaking
as
the
discomfited
cock
joins
*NL*
them
;
a
sow
with
her
brood
,
all
very
muddy
as
to
the
legs
,
and
curled
as
*NL*
to
the
tail
,
throws
in
some
deep
staccato
notes
;
our
friends
the
calves
*NL*
are
bleating
from
the
home
croft
;
and
,
under
all
,
a
fine
ear
discerns
*NL*
the
continuous
hum
of
human
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
great
barn-doors
are
thrown
wide
open
,
and
men
are
busy
*NL*
there
mending
the
harness
,
under
the
superintendence
of
Mr.
Goby
,
*NL*
the
``
whittaw
,
''
otherwise
saddler
,
who
entertains
them
with
the
latest
*NL*
Treddleston
gossip
.
It
is
certainly
rather
an
unfortunate
day
that
*NL*
Alick
,
the
shepherd
,
has
chosen
for
having
the
whittaws
,
since
the
*NL*
morning
turned
out
so
wet
;
and
Mrs.
Poyser
has
spoken
her
mind
pretty
*NL*
strongly
as
to
the
dirt
which
the
extra
number
of
men
's
shoes
brought
*NL*
into
the
house
at
dinnertime
.
Indeed
,
she
has
not
yet
recovered
her
*NL*
equanimity
on
the
subject
,
though
it
is
now
nearly
three
hours
since
*NL*
dinner
,
and
the
house-floor
is
perfectly
clean
again
;
as
clean
as
*NL*
everything
else
in
that
wonderful
house-place
,
where
the
only
chance
of
*NL*
collecting
a
few
grains
of
dust
would
be
to
climb
on
the
salt-coffer
,
*NL*
and
put
your
finger
on
the
high
mantel-shelf
on
which
the
glittering
*NL*
brass
candlesticks
are
enjoying
their
summer
sinecure
;
for
at
this
time
*NL*
of
year
,
of
course
,
every
one
goes
to
bed
while
it
is
yet
light
,
or
*NL*
at
least
light
enough
to
discern
the
outline
of
objects
after
you
*NL*
have
bruised
your
shins
against
them
.
Surely
nowhere
else
could
an
*NL*
oak
clock-case
and
an
oak
table
have
got
to
such
a
polish
by
the
hand
:
*NL*
genuine
``
elbow
polish
,
''
as
Mrs.
Poyser
called
it
,
for
she
thanked
God
*NL*
she
never
had
any
of
your
varnished
rubbish
in
her
house
.
Hetty
Sorrel
*NL*
often
took
the
opportunity
,
when
her
aunt
's
back
was
turned
,
of
looking
*NL*
at
the
pleasing
reflection
of
herself
in
those
polished
surfaces
,
for
*NL*
the
oak
table
was
usually
turned
up
like
a
screen
,
and
was
more
for
*NL*
ornament
than
for
use
;
and
she
could
see
herself
sometimes
in
the
great
*NL*
round
pewter
dishes
that
were
ranged
on
the
shelves
above
the
long
*NL*
deal
dinner-table
,
or
in
the
hobs
of
the
grate
,
which
always
shone
like
*NL*
jasper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
looking
at
its
brightest
at
this
moment
,
for
the
sun
*NL*
shone
right
on
the
pewter
dishes
,
and
from
their
reflecting
surfaces
*NL*
pleasant
jets
of
light
were
thrown
on
mellow
oak
and
bright
brass
--
and
*NL*
on
a
still
pleasanter
object
than
these
,
for
some
of
the
rays
fell
on
*NL*
Dinah
's
finely
moulded
cheek
,
and
lit
up
her
pale
red
hair
to
auburn
,
*NL*
as
she
bent
over
the
heavy
household
linen
which
she
was
mending
for
her
*NL*
aunt
.
No
scene
could
have
been
more
peaceful
,
if
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
*NL*
ironing
a
few
things
that
still
remained
from
the
Monday
's
wash
,
had
*NL*
not
been
making
a
frequent
clinking
with
her
iron
and
moving
to
and
*NL*
fro
whenever
she
wanted
it
to
cool
;
carrying
the
keen
glance
of
her
*NL*
blue-grey
eye
from
the
kitchen
to
the
dairy
,
where
Hetty
was
making
*NL*
up
the
butter
,
and
from
the
dairy
to
the
back
kitchen
,
where
Nancy
was
*NL*
taking
the
pies
out
of
the
oven
.
Do
not
suppose
,
however
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
was
elderly
or
shrewish
in
her
appearance
;
she
was
a
good-looking
*NL*
woman
,
not
more
than
eight-and-thirty
,
of
fair
complexion
and
sandy
*NL*
hair
,
well-shapen
,
light-footed
.
The
most
conspicuous
article
in
her
*NL*
attire
was
an
ample
checkered
linen
apron
,
which
almost
covered
her
*NL*
skirt
;
and
nothing
could
be
plainer
or
less
noticeable
than
her
cap
*NL*
and
gown
,
for
there
was
no
weakness
of
which
she
was
less
tolerant
than
*NL*
feminine
vanity
,
and
the
preference
of
ornament
to
utility
.
The
family
*NL*
likeness
between
her
and
her
niece
Dinah
Morris
,
with
the
contrast
*NL*
between
her
keenness
and
Dinah
's
seraphic
gentleness
of
expression
,
*NL*
might
have
served
a
painter
as
an
excellent
suggestion
for
a
Martha
and
*NL*
Mary
.
Their
eyes
were
just
of
the
same
colour
,
but
a
striking
test
of
*NL*
the
difference
in
their
operation
was
seen
in
the
demeanour
of
Trip
,
the
*NL*
black-and-tan
terrier
,
whenever
that
much-suspected
dog
unwarily
exposed
*NL*
himself
to
the
freezing
arctic
ray
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
glance
.
Her
tongue
*NL*
was
not
less
keen
than
her
eye
,
and
,
whenever
a
damsel
came
within
*NL*
earshot
,
seemed
to
take
up
an
unfinished
lecture
,
as
a
barrel-organ
*NL*
takes
up
a
tune
,
precisely
at
the
point
where
it
had
left
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
it
was
churning
day
was
another
reason
why
it
was
*NL*
inconvenient
to
have
the
whittaws
,
and
why
,
consequently
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
should
scold
Molly
the
housemaid
with
unusual
severity
.
To
all
*NL*
appearance
Molly
had
got
through
her
after-dinner
work
in
an
exemplary
*NL*
manner
,
had
``
cleaned
herself
''
with
great
dispatch
,
and
now
came
to
ask
,
*NL*
submissively
,
if
she
should
sit
down
to
her
spinning
till
milking
time
.
*NL*
But
this
blameless
conduct
,
according
to
Mrs.
Poyser
,
shrouded
a
secret
*NL*
indulgence
of
unbecoming
wishes
,
which
she
now
dragged
forth
and
held
up
*NL*
to
Molly
's
view
with
cutting
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spinning
,
indeed
!
It
is
n't
spinning
as
you
'd
be
at
,
I
'll
be
bound

*NL*
let
you
have
your

I
never
knew
your

for
gallowsness
.
To
*NL*
think
of
a
gell
o

your
age
wanting
to
go
and
sit
with
half-a-dozen
men

*NL*
I

been
ashamed
to
let
the
words
pass
over
my
lips
if
I
'd

*NL*
And
you

as
have
been
here
ever

Michaelmas
,
and
I
hired
you
*NL*
at
Treddles

without
a
bit
o

as
I
say
,
you
might
*NL*
be
grateful
to
be
hired
in
that
way
to
a
respectable
place

and
you
knew
*NL*
no
more
o

what
belongs
to
work
when
you
come

saw

should
like
to

Why

heaps
i

the
corners

anybody

think
you
'd
never
been
*NL*
brought
up
among

And
as
for
spinning
,
why
,
you
've
wasted
*NL*
as
much
as
your
wage
i
'
the
flax
you
've
spoiled
learning
to
spin
.
*NL*
And
you
've
a
right
to
feel
that
,
and
not
to
go
about
as
gaping
and
as
*NL*
thoughtless
as
if
you
was
beholding

nobody

Comb

never

``

said
Molly
,
whimpering
,
*NL*
and
quite
overcome
by
this
Dantean
picture
of
her
future
,

The
small
chirruping
voice

uttered
this

came
from
a

sunny-haired

between
three

,
who

seated

a

Mrs.
Poyser
,
carrying
*NL*
away
her
iron
.
``
Run
into
the
dairy
and
see

``

rejoined
Totty
,
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
provided
with
several
relays
of
requests
;
at
the
same
time
,
taking
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
her
momentary
leisure
to
put
her
fingers
into
a
bowl
*NL*
of
starch
,
and
drag
it
down
so
as
to
empty
the
contents
with
tolerable
*NL*
completeness
on
to
the
ironing
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
anybody
see
the
like
?

screamed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
running
towards
*NL*
the
table
when
her
eye
had
fallen
on
the
blue
stream
.
``
The
child

*NL*

mischief

What

do
to
*NL*
you
,
you
naughty
,
naughty
gell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Totty
,
however
,
had
descended
from
her
chair
with
great
swiftness
,
and
*NL*
was
already
in
retreat
towards
the
dairy
with
a
sort
of
waddling
run
,
*NL*
and
an
amount
of
fat
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
which
made
her
look
like
*NL*
the
metamorphosis
of
a
white
suckling
pig
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
starch
having
been
wiped
up
by
Molly
's
help
,
and
the
ironing
*NL*
apparatus
put
by
,
Mrs.
Poyser
took
up
her
knitting
which
always
lay
*NL*
ready
at
hand
,
and
was
the
work
she
liked
best
,
because
she
could
carry
*NL*
it
on
automatically
as
she
walked
to
and
fro
.
But
now
she
came
and
sat
*NL*
down
opposite
Dinah
,
whom
she
looked
at
in
a
meditative
way
,
as
she
*NL*
knitted
her
grey
worsted
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
th
'
image
o
'
your
Aunt
Judith
,
Dinah
,
when
you
sit
a-sewing
.
I
*NL*
could
almost
fancy
it
was
thirty
years
back
,
and
I
was
a
little
gell
*NL*
at
home
,
looking
at
Judith
as
she
sat
at
her
work
,
after
she
'd
done
*NL*
the
house
up
;
only
it
was
a
little
cottage
,
Father
's
was
,
and
not
a
big
*NL*
rambling
house
as
gets
dirty
i
'
one
corner
as
fast
as
you
clean
it
in
*NL*
another
--
but
for
all
that
,
I
could
fancy
you
was
your
Aunt
Judith
,
only
*NL*
her
hair
was
a
deal
darker
than
yours
,
and
she
was
stouter
and
broader
*NL*
i
'
the
shoulders
.
Judith
and
me
allays
hung
together
,
though
she
had
*NL*
such
queer
ways
,
but
your
mother
and
her
never
could
agree
.
Ah
,
your
*NL*
mother
little
thought
as
she
'd
have
a
daughter
just
cut
out
after
the
*NL*
very
pattern
o
'
Judith
,
and
leave
her
an
orphan
,
too
,
for
Judith
to
*NL*
take
care
on
,
and
bring
up
with
a
spoon
when
SHE
was
in
the
graveyard
at
*NL*
Stoniton
.
I
allays
said
that
o
'
Judith
,
as
she
'd
bear
a
pound
weight
*NL*
any
day
to
save
anybody
else
carrying
a
ounce
.
And
she
was
just
the
same
*NL*
from
the
first
o
'
my
remembering
her
;
it
made
no
difference
in
her
,
as
*NL*
I
could
see
,
when
she
took
to
the
Methodists
,
only
she
talked
a
bit
*NL*
different
and
wore
a
different
sort
o
'
cap
;
but
she
'd
never
in
her
life
*NL*
spent
a
penny
on
herself
more
than
keeping
herself
decent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
a
blessed
woman
,
''
said
Dinah
;
``
God
had
given
her
a
loving
,
*NL*
self-forgetting
nature
,
and
He
perfected
it
by
grace
.
And
she
was
very
*NL*
fond
of
you
too
,
Aunt
Rachel
.
I
often
heard
her
talk
of
you
in
the
same
*NL*
sort
of
way
.
When
she
had
that
bad
illness
,
and
I
was
only
eleven
*NL*
years
old
,
she
used
to
say
,
`
You
'll
have
a
friend
on
earth
in
your
Aunt
*NL*
Rachel
,
if
I
'm
taken
from
you

for
she
has
a
kind
heart
,

and
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
've
found
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

how

anybody
`

be
cunning
to
do
anything
for
you

I
think
;
you
're
like
the
birds
o

th

air
,
and

nobody

how

*NL*
I
'd
ha

been
glad
to
behave
to
you
like
a
mother
's
sister
,
if
you
'd
come
*NL*
and
live
i

this
country
where
there
's
some
shelter
and
victual
for
*NL*
man

beast
,
and
folks
do
n't
live
on
the
naked
hills
,
like
poultry
*NL*
a-scratching
on
a

And
then
you
might
get
married

there
'd
be
plenty
ready
to
have
you

leave
*NL*
off
that
preaching

as
is
ten
times
worse
than
anything
your
Aunt
Judith
*NL*
ever
did

And
even
if
you
'd
marry
Seth
Bede
,
as
is
a
poor
wool-gathering
*NL*
Methodist
and
's
never
like
to
have
a

beforehand

I
know
your
*NL*
uncle

help
you
with
a
pig
,

very

good-natur

to

bound
,
as
much
as
ever
he
'd
do
*NL*
for
Hetty
,
though
she
's
his
own
niece

And
there
's
linen
in
the
house
*NL*
as
I
could
well
spare
you
,
for
I
've
got
lots
o

sheeting
and
*NL*
table-clothing
,
and
towelling
,
as
is

made
up
.
There
's
a
piece
o

*NL*
sheeting
I
could
give
you
as
that
squinting
Kitty
spun
--
she
was
a
rare
*NL*
girl
to
spin
,
for
all
she
squinted
,
and
the
children
could
n't
abide
her
;
*NL*

you

the
spinning

going
on

there

new

*NL*
wove
twice
as

But
where
's
the
use
o

down

out

I
verily
believe

go
into
a
bundle
no

And
all
because

about

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not

*NL*
``
Yes

Mrs.

rejoined

rather
*NL*
sharply
;
``
else
why
should
n't
them

know
best
what
's
in

Bible
--
the
*NL*
parsons
and
people
as
have
got
nothing
to
do
but
learn
it
--
do
the
same
*NL*
as
you
do
?
But
,
for
the
matter
o
'
that
,
if
everybody
was
to
do
like

you

the
world
must
come

for
if
everybody

without

home

with
poor
eating

drinking

and
was
*NL*
allays
talking

must
despise

to

o

bringing
up
their
families
,
and
laying
by
*NL*
against
a
bad
harvest
.
It
stands
to
sense
as
that
ca
n't
be
the
right
*NL*
religion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
dear
aunt
,
you
never
heard
me
say
that
all
people
are
called
to
*NL*
forsake
their
work
and
their
families
.
It
's
quite
right
the
land
should
*NL*
be
ploughed
and
sowed
,
and
the
precious
corn
stored
,
and
the
things
*NL*
of
this
life
cared
for
,
and
right
that
people
should
rejoice
in
their
*NL*
families
,
and
provide
for
them
,
so
that
this
is
done
in
the
fear
of
the
*NL*
Lord
,
and
that
they
are
not
unmindful
of
the
soul
's
wants
while
they
are
*NL*
caring
for
the
body
.
We
can
all
be
servants
of
God
wherever
our
lot
is
*NL*
cast
,
but
He
gives
us
different
sorts
of
work
,
according
as
He
fits
us
*NL*
for
it
and
calls
us
to
it
.
I
can
no
more
help
spending
my
life
in
trying
*NL*
to
do
what
I
can
for
the
souls
of
others
,
than
you
could
help
running
if
*NL*
you
heard
little
Totty
crying
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
the
voice
*NL*
would
go
to
your
heart
,
you
would
think
the
dear
child
was
in
trouble
or
*NL*
in
danger
,
and
you
could
n't
rest
without
running
to
help
her
and
comfort
*NL*
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
rising
and
walking
towards
the
door
,
``
I
know
it
*NL*

be
just
the

was

You
'd
make

*NL*
the

answer

at

I

*NL*
The
causeway
outside
the
kitchen
door
was
dry
enough
now
for
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
to
stand
there
quite
pleasantly
and
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
yard
,
*NL*
the
grey
worsted
stocking
making
a
steady
progress
in
her
hands
all
the
*NL*
while
.
But
she
had
not
been
standing
there
more
than
five
minutes
before
*NL*
she
came
in
again
,
and
said
to
Dinah
,
in
rather
a
flurried
,
awe-stricken
*NL*
tone
,
``
If
there

Captain
Donnithorne

my

come
to
speak
about
your
preaching
*NL*
on
the
Green

Dinah
;
it
's
you
must
answer
'em
,
for
I
'm
dumb

I
've
said
*NL*
enough
a
`
ready
about
your
bringing
such
disgrace
upo

your
uncle

*NL*
family

I
would
n't
ha

minded
if
you

been
Mr.

*NL*
niece

folks
must
put
up
wi

,
as
they
put
up
wi

their
own

noses

it
's
their

flesh

But
to
think
of

Dinah
gently
,
``

*NL*
``
Direction

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
,
knitting
in
a
rapid
and
agitated
manner
.
``
When
there
's
a

maggot

in
your
head

call
it

and
then
nothing
*NL*
can
stir
you

you
look
like

the
outside

By
this
time
the
two
gentlemen
had
reached
the
palings
and
had
got
*NL*
down
from
their
horses
:
it
was
plain
they
meant
to
come
in
.
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
advanced
to
the
door
to
meet
them
,
curtsying
low
and
trembling
between
*NL*
anger
with
Dinah
and
anxiety
to
conduct
herself
with
perfect
propriety
*NL*
on
the
occasion
.
For
in
those
days
the
keenest
of
bucolic
minds
felt
a
*NL*
whispering
awe
at
the
sight
of
the
gentry
,
such
as
of
old
men
felt
when
*NL*
they
stood
on
tiptoe
to
watch
the
gods
passing
by
in
tall
human
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
how
are

stormy
morning

said
Mr.

Irwine
,
with
his
stately
cordiality

Our

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
captain
,
looking
eagerly
*NL*
round
the
kitchen
,
as
if
his
eye
were
seeking
something
it
could
not

find
.
``

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

Poyser

relieved
a
little
by
this
compliment
and
the
captain
's
evident
*NL*
good-humour
,
but
still
glancing
anxiously
at
Mr.

who

she
saw

looking
at
Dinah

advancing
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Captain

himself

passage

;
I
'll
just
look
at
the
whelps
and
leave
a
message
about
*NL*
them
with
your
shepherd
.
I
must
come
another
day
and
see
your
husband
;
I
*NL*
want
to
have
a
consultation
with
him
about
horses
.
Do
you
know
when
he
's
*NL*
likely
to
be
at
liberty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
you
can
hardly
miss
him
,
except
it
's
o
'
Treddles
`
on
*NL*
market-day
--
that
's
of
a
Friday
,
you
know
.
For
if
he
's
anywhere
on
the
*NL*
farm
we
can
send
for
him
in
a
minute
.
If
we
'd
got
rid
o
'
the
Scantlands
,
*NL*
we
should
have
no
outlying
fields
;
and
I
should
be
glad
of
it
,
for
if
*NL*
ever
anything
happens
,
he
's
sure
to
be
gone
to
the
Scantlands
.
Things
*NL*
allays
happen
so
contrairy
,
if
they
've
a
chance
;
and
it
's
an
unnat
`
ral
*NL*
thing
to
have
one
bit
o
'
your
farm
in
one
county
and
all
the
rest
in
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
Scantlands
would
go
much
better
with
Choyce
's
farm
,
especially
*NL*
as
he
wants
dairyland
and
you
've
got
plenty
.
I
think
yours
is
the
*NL*
prettiest
farm
on
the
estate
,
though
;
and
do
you
know
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
if
I
*NL*
were
going
to
marry
and
settle
,
I
should
be
tempted
to
turn
you
out
,
and
*NL*
do
up
this
fine
old
house
,
and
turn
farmer
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
rather
alarmed
,
``
you
would
n't
like
it
at
*NL*
all
.
As
for
farming
,
it
's
putting
money
into
your
pocket
wi
'
your
*NL*
right
hand
and
fetching
it
out
wi
'
your
left
.
As
fur
as
I
can
see
,
it
's
*NL*
raising
victual
for
other
folks
and
just
getting
a
mouthful
for
yourself
*NL*
and
your
children
as
you
go
along
.
Not
as
you
'd
be
like
a
poor
man
as
*NL*
wants
to
get
his
bread
--
you
could
afford
to
lose
as
much
money
as
you
*NL*
liked
i
'
farming
--
but
it
's
poor
fun
losing
money
,
I
should
think
,
though
*NL*
I
understan
'
it
's
what
the
great
folks
i
'
London
play
at
more
than
*NL*
anything
.
For
my
husband
heard
at
market
as
Lord
Dacey
's
eldest
son
had
*NL*
lost
thousands
upo
'
thousands
to
the
Prince
o
'
Wales
,
and
they
said
*NL*
my
lady
was
going
to
pawn
her
jewels
to
pay
for
him
.
But
you
know
more
*NL*
about
that
than
I
do
,
sir
.
But
,
as
for
farming
,
sir
,
I
canna
think
as
*NL*
you
'd
like
it
;
and
this
house
--
the
draughts
in
it
are
enough
to
cut
you
*NL*
through
,
and
it
's
my
opinion
the
floors
upstairs
are
very
rotten
,
and
*NL*
the
rats
i
'
the
cellar
are
beyond
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
a
terrible
picture
,
Mrs.
Poyser
.
I
think
I
should
be
doing
*NL*
you
a
service
to
turn
you
out
of
such
a
place
.
But
there
's
no
chance
*NL*
of
that
.
I
'm
not
likely
to
settle
for
the
next
twenty
years
,
till
I
'm
a
*NL*
stout
gentleman
of
forty
;
and
my
grandfather
would
never
consent
to
part
*NL*
with
such
good
tenants
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
if
he
thinks
so
well
o
'
Mr.
Poyser
for
a
tenant
I
wish
you
*NL*
could
put
in
a
word
for
him
to
allow
us
some
new
gates
for
the
Five
*NL*
closes
,
for
my
husband
's
been
asking
and
asking
till
he
's
tired
,
and
to
*NL*
think
o
'
what
he
's
done
for
the
farm
,
and
's
never
had
a
penny
allowed
*NL*
him
,
be
the
times
bad
or
good
.
And
as
I
've
said
to
my
husband
often
and
*NL*
often
,
I
'm
sure
if
the
captain
had
anything
to
do
with
it
,
it
would
n't
*NL*
be
so
.
Not
as
I
wish
to
speak
disrespectful
o

them
as
have
got
the
*NL*
power
i

their
hands
,

it
's
more
than
flesh
and
blood
`
ull
bear
*NL*
sometimes
,
to
be
toiling
and
striving
,
and
up
early
and
down
late
,
and
*NL*
hardly
sleeping
a
wink
when
you
lie
down
for
thinking
as
the
cheese
*NL*
may
swell
,
or
the
cows
may
slip
their
calf
,
or
the
wheat
may
grow
green
*NL*
again
i
'
the
sheaf
--
and
after
all
,
at
th

end
o
'
the
year
,
it
's
like
*NL*
as
if
you
'd
been
cooking
a
feast
and
had
got
the
smell
of
it
for
your
*NL*
pains

*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
once
launched
into
conversation
,
always
sailed
along
*NL*
without
any
check
from
her
preliminary
awe
of
the
gentry
.
The
confidence
*NL*
she
felt
in
her
own
powers
of
exposition
was
a
motive
force
that
*NL*
overcame
all
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
should
only
do
harm
instead
of
good
,
if
I
were
to
speak
*NL*
about

gates

Mrs.

said
the
captain
,
``
though
I
assure
you
*NL*
there
's
no
man
on

I
would
sooner
say
a

your

I
know
his

in
better
order
than
any
other
within

ten
miles
of

as
for

he
added
,
smiling
,
``
I

This
Mrs.

said
blushing

and
believing
that
the
captain
*NL*
was
really
interested
in
her
milk-pans
,

would
adjust
his
opinion

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dairy
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
dairy
was
certainly
worth
looking
at
:
it
was
a
scene
to
sicken
for
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
calenture
in
hot
and
dusty
streets
--
such
coolness
,
such
*NL*
purity
,
such
fresh
fragrance
of
new-pressed
cheese
,
of
firm
butter
,
of
*NL*
wooden
vessels
perpetually
bathed
in
pure
water
;
such
soft
colouring
of
*NL*
red
earthenware
and
creamy
surfaces
,
brown
wood
and
polished
tin
,
grey
*NL*
limestone
and
rich
orange-red
rust
on
the
iron
weights
and
hooks
and
*NL*
hinges
.
But
one
gets
only
a
confused
notion
of
these
details
when
they
*NL*
surround
a
distractingly
pretty
girl
of
seventeen
,
standing
on
little
*NL*
pattens
and
rounding
her
dimpled
arm
to
lift
a
pound
of
butter
out
of
*NL*
the
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
blushed
a
deep
rose-colour
when
Captain
Donnithorne
entered
the
*NL*
dairy
and
spoke
to
her
;
but
it
was
not
at
all
a
distressed
blush
,
for
*NL*
it
was
inwreathed
with
smiles
and
dimples
,
and
with
sparkles
from
under
*NL*
long
,
curled
,
dark
eyelashes
;
and
while
her
aunt
was
discoursing
to
him
*NL*
about
the
limited
amount
of
milk
that
was
to
be
spared
for
butter
and
*NL*
cheese
so
long
as
the
calves
were
not
all
weaned
,
and
a
large
quantity
*NL*
but
inferior
quality
of
milk
yielded
by
the
shorthorn
,
which
had
*NL*
been
bought
on
experiment
,
together
with
other
matters
which
must
be
*NL*
interesting
to
a
young
gentleman
who
would
one
day
be
a
landlord
,
Hetty
*NL*
tossed
and
patted
her
pound
of
butter
with
quite
a
self-possessed
,
*NL*
coquettish
air
,
slyly
conscious
that
no
turn
of
her
head
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
various
orders
of
beauty
,
causing
men
to
make
fools
of
*NL*
themselves
in
various
styles
,
from
the
desperate
to
the
sheepish
;
but
*NL*
there
is
one
order
of
beauty
which
seems
made
to
turn
the
heads
not
only
*NL*
of
men
,
but
of
all
intelligent
mammals
,
even
of
women
.
It
is
a
beauty
*NL*
like
that
of
kittens
,
or
very
small
downy
ducks
making
gentle
rippling
*NL*
noises
with
their
soft
bills
,
or
babies
just
beginning
to
toddle
and
*NL*
to
engage
in
conscious
mischief
--
a
beauty
with
which
you
can
never
be
*NL*
angry
,
but
that
you
feel
ready
to
crush
for
inability
to
comprehend
the
*NL*
state
of
mind
into
which
it
throws
you
.
Hetty
Sorrel
's
was
that
sort
*NL*
of
beauty
.
Her
aunt
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
professed
to
despise
all
personal
*NL*
attractions
and
intended
to
be
the
severest
of
mentors
,
continually
*NL*
gazed
at
Hetty
's
charms
by
the
sly
,
fascinated
in
spite
of
herself
;
and
*NL*
after
administering
such
a
scolding
as
naturally
flowed
from
her
anxiety
*NL*
to
do
well
by
her
husband
's
niece
--
who
had
no
mother
of
her
own
to
scold
*NL*
her
,
poor
thing
!
--
she
would
often
confess
to
her
husband
,
when
they
were
*NL*
safe
out
of
hearing
,
that
she
firmly
believed
,
``
the
naughtier
the
little
*NL*
huzzy
behaved
,
the
prettier
she
looked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
of
little
use
for
me
to
tell
you
that
Hetty
's
cheek
was
like
a
*NL*
rose-petal
,
that
dimples
played
about
her
pouting
lips
,
that
her
large
*NL*
dark
eyes
hid
a
soft
roguishness
under
their
long
lashes
,
and
that
her
*NL*
curly
hair
,
though
all
pushed
back
under
her
round
cap
while
she
was
at
*NL*
work
,
stole
back
in
dark
delicate
rings
on
her
forehead
,
and
about
her
*NL*
white
shell-like
ears
;
it
is
of
little
use
for
me
to
say
how
lovely
*NL*
was
the
contour
of
her
pink-and-white
neckerchief
,
tucked
into
her
low
*NL*
plum-coloured
stuff
bodice
,
or
how
the
linen
butter-making
apron
,
with
*NL*
its
bib
,
seemed
a
thing
to
be
imitated
in
silk
by
duchesses
,
since
it
*NL*
fell
in
such
charming
lines
,
or
how
her
brown
stockings
and
thick-soled
*NL*
buckled
shoes
lost
all
that
clumsiness
which
they
must
certainly
have
*NL*
had
when
empty
of
her
foot
and
ankle
--
of
little
use
,
unless
you
have
*NL*
seen
a
woman
who
affected
you
as
Hetty
affected
her
beholders
,
for
*NL*
otherwise
,
though
you
might
conjure
up
the
image
of
a
lovely
woman
,
she
*NL*
would
not
in
the
least
resemble
that
distracting
kittenlike
maiden
.
I
*NL*
might
mention
all
the
divine
charms
of
a
bright
spring
day
,
but
if
you
*NL*
had
never
in
your
life
utterly
forgotten
yourself
in
straining
your
eyes
*NL*
after
the
mounting
lark
,
or
in
wandering
through
the
still
lanes
when
*NL*
the
fresh-opened
blossoms
fill
them
with
a
sacred
silent
beauty
like
*NL*
that
of
fretted
aisles
,
where
would
be
the
use
of
my
descriptive
*NL*
catalogue
?
I
could
never
make
you
know
what
I
meant
by
a
bright
spring
*NL*
day
.
Hetty
's
was
a
spring-tide
beauty
;
it
was
the
beauty
of
young
*NL*
frisking
things
,
round-limbed
,
gambolling
,
circumventing
you
by
a
*NL*
false
air
of
innocence
--
the
innocence
of
a
young
star-browed
calf
,
for
*NL*
example
,
that
,
being
inclined
for
a
promenade
out
of
bounds
,
leads
you
*NL*
a
severe
steeplechase
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
only
comes
to
a
stand
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
bog
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
are
the
prettiest
attitudes
and
movements
into
which
a
pretty
*NL*
girl
is
thrown
in
making
up
butter
--
tossing
movements
that
give
a
*NL*
charming
curve
to
the
arm
,
and
a
sideward
inclination
of
the
round
white
*NL*
neck
;
little
patting
and
rolling
movements
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
nice
adaptations
and
finishings
which
can
not
at
all
be
effected
*NL*
without
a
great
play
of
the
pouting
mouth
and
the
dark
eyes
.
And
then
*NL*
the
butter
itself
seems
to
communicate
a
fresh
charm
--
it
is
so
pure
,
*NL*
so
sweet-scented
;
it
is
turned
off
the
mould
with
such
a
beautiful
*NL*
firm
surface
,
like
marble
in
a
pale
yellow
light
!
Moreover
,
Hetty
was
*NL*
particularly
clever
at
making
up
the
butter
;
it
was
the
one
performance
*NL*
of
hers
that
her
aunt
allowed
to
pass
without
severe
criticism
;
so
she
*NL*
handled
it
with
all
the
grace
that
belongs
to
mastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
be
ready
for
a
great
holiday
on
the
thirtieth
of
July

*NL*

Poyser

''
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
when
he
had
sufficiently
admired
*NL*
the
dairy
and
given
several
improvised
opinions
on
Swede
turnips
and
*NL*
shorthorns
.
``
You
know
what
is
to
happen
then
,
and
I
shall
expect

earliest
and
leave
latest

promise
me
your
hand

Hetty

If
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
smiled
and
blushed
,
but
before
she
could
answer
,
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
interposed
,
scandalized
at
the
mere
suggestion
that
the
young
squire
*NL*
could
be
excluded
by
any
meaner
partners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

are
very
kind

take
that
notice
of

*NL*
continued
,
determined
to
make
Hetty
look
at
him
and
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
dropped
the
prettiest
little
curtsy
,
and
stole
a
half-shy
,
*NL*
half-coquettish
glance
at
him
as
she
said
,
``
Yes
,
thank
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
must
bring
all
your
children
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Poyser
;
your
*NL*
little
Totty

as
well
as
the
boys
.
I
want
all
the
youngest
children
on
*NL*
the
estate
to
be
there
--
all
those
who
will
be
fine
young
men
and
women
*NL*
when
I
'm
a
bald
old
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
sir
,
that
`
ull
be
a
long
time
first

''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
quite
*NL*
overcome
at
the
young
squire
's
speaking
so
lightly
of
himself
,
and
*NL*
thinking
how
her
husband
would
be
interested
in
hearing
her
recount
this
*NL*
remarkable
specimen
of
high-born
humour
.
The
captain
was
thought
to
*NL*
be
``
very
full
of
his
jokes
,
''
and
was
a
great
favourite
throughout
the
*NL*
estate
on
account
of
his
free
manners
.
Every
tenant
was
quite
sure
*NL*
things
would
be
different
when
the
reins
got
into
his
hands
--
there
*NL*
was
to
be
a
millennial
abundance
of
new
gates
,
allowances
of
lime
,
and
*NL*
returns
of
ten
per
cent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
Totty
to-day
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
IS
the
little
un
,
Hetty
?
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
``
She
came
in
here
not
*NL*
long
ago

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

She
went
into
the
brewhouse
to
Nancy
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
proud
mother
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
show
her
Totty
,
*NL*
passed
at
once
into
the
back
kitchen
,
in
search
of
her
,
not
,
however
,
*NL*
without
misgivings
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
render
her
*NL*
person
and
attire
unfit
for
presentation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
carry
the
butter
to
market
when
you
've
made
it
?
''
said
the
*NL*
Captain
to
Hetty
,
meanwhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
sir
;
not
when
it
's
so
heavy
.
I
'm
not
strong
enough
to
carry
it

*NL*
Alick
takes
it
on
horseback
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
sure
your
pretty
arms
were
never
meant
for
such
heavy
weights

*NL*
But
you
go
out
a
walk
sometimes
these
pleasant
evenings
,
do
n't
you
?
*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
walk
in
the
Chase
sometimes
,
now
it
's
so
green
and
*NL*
pleasant
?
I
hardly
ever
see
you
anywhere
except
at
home
and
at
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
does
n't
like
me
to
go
a-walking
only
when
I
'm
going
somewhere
,
''
*NL*
said
Hetty
.
``
But
I
go
through
the
Chase
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
ever
go
to
see
Mrs.
Best

the

I
think
I
saw

you
once
in
the
housekeeper

room

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

Mrs.

Mrs.
Pomfret

,
as
I
go
to
see
.
*NL*
She
's
teaching
me
tent-stitch
and
the
lace-mending
.
I
'm
going
to
tea
*NL*
with
her
to-morrow
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
why
there
had
been
space
for
this
tete-a-tete
can
only
be
*NL*
known
by
looking
into
the
back
kitchen
,
where
Totty
had
been
discovered
*NL*
rubbing
a
stray
blue-bag
against
her
nose
,
and
in
the
same
moment
*NL*
allowing
some
liberal
indigo
drops
to
fall
on
her
afternoon
pinafore
.
*NL*
But
now
she
appeared
holding
her
mother
's
hand
--
the
end
of
her
round
*NL*
nose
rather
shiny
from
a
recent
and
hurried
application
of
soap
and
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
she
is
!
''
said
the
captain
,
lifting
her
up
and
setting
her
on
the
*NL*
low
stone
shelf
.
``
Here
's
Totty
!
By
the
by
,
what
's
her
other
name
?
She
*NL*
was
n't
christened
Totty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
we
call
her
sadly
out
of
her
name
.
Charlotte
's
her
christened
*NL*
name
.
It
's
a
name
i
'
Mr.
Poyser
's
family
:
his
grandmother
was
named
*NL*
Charlotte
.
But
we
began
with
calling
her
Lotty
,
and
now
it
's
got
to
*NL*
Totty
.
To
be
sure
it
's
more
like
a
name
for
a
dog
than
a
Christian
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Totty
's
a
capital
name
.
Why
,
she
looks
like
a
Totty
.
Has
she
got
a
*NL*
pocket
on
?
''
said
the
captain
,
feeling
in
his
own
waistcoat
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Totty
immediately
with
great
gravity
lifted
up
her
frock
,
and
showed
a
*NL*
tiny
pink
pocket
at
present
in
a
state
of
collapse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
dot
notin
'
in
it
,
''
she
said
,
as
she
looked
down
at
it
very
*NL*
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
What
a
pity
!
Such
a
pretty
pocket
.
Well
,
I
think
I
've
got
some
*NL*
things
in
mine
that
will
make
a
pretty
jingle
in
it
.
Yes
!
I
declare
I
've
*NL*
got
five
little
round
silver
things
,
and
hear
what
a
pretty
noise
they
*NL*
make
in
Totty
's
pink
pocket
.
''
Here
he
shook
the
pocket
with
the
five
*NL*
sixpences
in
it
,
and
Totty
showed
her
teeth
and
wrinkled
her
nose
in
*NL*
great
glee
;
but
,
divining
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
by
*NL*
staying
,
she
jumped
off
the
shelf
and
ran
away
to
jingle
her
pocket
in
*NL*
the
hearing
of
Nancy
,
while
her
mother
called
after
her
,
``
Oh
for
shame
,
*NL*
you
naughty
gell
!
Not
to
thank
the
captain
for
what
he
's
given
you
I
'm
*NL*
sure
,
sir
,
it
's
very
kind
of
you
;
but
she
's
spoiled
shameful
;
her
father

her
said

there
's
no

*NL*
*NL*
With
a
``
good-bye

a
bright
glance

and
a
bow
to
Hetty
Arthur
left
the
*NL*
dairy
.
But
he
was
mistaken
in
imagining
himself
waited
for

The
rector
*NL*
had
been
so
much
interested
in
his
conversation
with
Dinah
that
he
would
*NL*
not
have
chosen
to
close
it
earlier
;
and
you
shall
hear
now
what
they
*NL*
had
been
saying
to
each
other

*NL*
DINAH
,
who
had
risen
when
the
gentlemen
came
in
,
but
still
kept
hold
of
*NL*
the
sheet
she
was
mending
,
curtsied
respectfully
when
she
saw
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
looking
at
her
and
advancing
towards
her
.
He
had
never
yet
spoken
to
*NL*
her
,
or
stood
face
to
face
with
her
,
and
her
first
thought
,
as
her
eyes
*NL*
met
his
,
was
,
``
What
a
well-favoured
countenance
!
Oh
that
the
good
seed
*NL*
might
fall
on
that
soil
,
for
it
would
surely
flourish
.
''
The
agreeable
*NL*
impression
must
have
been
mutual
,
for
Mr.
Irwine
bowed
to
her
with
a
*NL*
benignant
deference
,
which
would
have
been
equally
in
place
if
she
had
*NL*
been
the
most
dignified
lady
of
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
only
a
visitor
in
this
neighbourhood

I
think
?
''
were
his
first
*NL*
words
,
as
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
I
come
from
Snowfield
,
in
Stonyshire

But
my
aunt

very

wanting
me
to
have
rest
from
my
work
there
,
because
I
'd
been
ill

she
invited
me
to
come
and
stay
with
her
for
a
while

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
remember
Snowfield
very
well
;
I
once
had
occasion
to
go
there

*NL*
It
's
a
dreary
bleak
place
.
They
were
building
a
cotton-mill
there
;
but
*NL*
that
's
many
years
ago
now
.
I
suppose
the
place
is
a
good
deal
changed
by
*NL*
the
employment
that
mill
must
have
brought

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
changed
so
far
as
the
mill
has
brought
people
there

who
get
a

livelihood
for

working
in
it
,
and
make
it
better
for
the
*NL*
tradesfolks

I
work
in
it
myself
,

have
reason
to
be
grateful

for
*NL*
thereby
I
have
enough
and
to
spare

But
it
's
still
a
bleak
place

as
you

very
different
from
this
country

*NL*
``
You

relations

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
an
aunt
there
once

she
brought
me
up

I
was

was
taken
away
seven

not

leave

Snowfield

And
have
you
been
long
in

I

you

preached
at

last
night

It
does

forbid
them
,
sir
,
when
they
've
a
clear
call
to
the
work

*NL*
and
when
their
ministry
is
owned
by
the
conversion
of
sinners
and
the
*NL*
strengthening
of
God
's
people
.
Mrs.
Fletcher
,
as
you
may
have
heard
*NL*
about
,
was
the
first
woman
to
preach
in
the
Society
,
I
believe
,
before
*NL*
she
was
married
,
when
she
was
Miss
Bosanquet

Mr.

approved

undertaking

She
had
a
great
gift

and
there
are
many
*NL*
others
now
living
who
are
precious
fellow-helpers
in
the
work
of
the
*NL*
ministry

I
understand
there
's
been
voices
raised
against
it
in
the
*NL*
Society
of
late
,
but
I
can
not
but
think
their
counsel
will
come
to
*NL*
nought
.
It
is
n't
for
men
to
make
channels
for
God
's
Spirit
,
as
they
*NL*
make
channels
for
the
watercourses
,
and
say
,
`
Flow
here
,
but
flow
not
*NL*
there
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
you
find
some
danger

I
do

it

far
from

do
n't
you
find
sometimes
that
*NL*
both
men
and
women
fancy
themselves
channels
for
God
's
Spirit
,
and
are
*NL*
quite
mistaken
,
so
that
they
set
about
a
work
for
which
they
are
unfit
*NL*
and
bring
holy
things
into
contempt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
it
is
so
sometimes

for
there
have
been
evil-doers
among

have
sought

deceive
the
brethren

some
there

who
deceive

their
own

But
we
are
not
without
discipline

correction

There
's
a
very
strict
order
kept
among

us
,
and
the
brethren
and
sisters
watch
for
each
other
's
souls
as
they
*NL*

must
give
account

They
do
n't
go
every
one
his

Am
*NL*
I
my
brother
's
keeper

*NL*
``
But
tell
me
--
if
I
may
ask
,
and
I
am
really
interested
in
knowing
*NL*
it

how
you
first
came
to
think
of
preaching
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
did
n't
think
of
it
at
all
--
I
'd
been
used
from
the
time
*NL*
I
was
sixteen
to
talk
to
the
little
children
,
and
teach
them
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
I
had
had
my
heart
enlarged
to
speak
in
class
,
and
was
much
*NL*
drawn
out
in
prayer
with
the
sick
.
But
I
had
felt
no
call
to
preach
,
for
*NL*
when
I
'm
not
greatly
wrought
upon
,
I
'm
too
much
given
to
sit
still
and
*NL*
keep
by
myself
.
It
seems
as
if
I
could
sit
silent
all
day
long
with
the
*NL*
thought
of
God
overflowing
my
soul
--
as
the
pebbles
lie
bathed
in
the
*NL*
Willow
Brook
.
For
thoughts
are
so
great
--
are
n't
they
,
sir
?
They
seem
to
*NL*
lie
upon
us
like
a
deep
flood
;
and
it
's
my
besetment
to
forget
where
*NL*
I
am
and
everything
about
me
,
and
lose
myself
in
thoughts
that
I
could
*NL*
give
no
account
of
,
for
I
could
neither
make
a
beginning
nor
ending
of
*NL*
them
in
words
.
That
was
my
way
as
long
as
I
can
remember
;
but
sometimes
*NL*
it
seemed
as
if
speech
came
to
me
without
any
will
of
my
own
,
and
words
*NL*
were
given
to
me
that
came
out
as
the
tears
come
,
because
our
hearts
*NL*
are
full
and
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
And
those
were
always
times
of
great
*NL*
blessing
,
though
I
had
never
thought
it
could
be
so
with
me
before
*NL*
a
congregation
of
people
.
But
,
sir
,
we
are
led
on
,
like
the
little
*NL*
children
,
by
a
way
that
we
know
not
.
I
was
called
to
preach
quite
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
since
then
I
have
never
been
left
in
doubt
about
the
work
*NL*
that
was
laid
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
the
circumstances
--
just
how
it
was
,
the
very
day
you
began
*NL*
to
preach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
one
Sunday
I
walked
with
brother
Marlowe
,
who
was
an
aged
*NL*
man
,
one
of
the
local
preachers
,
all
the
way
to
Hetton-Deeps
--
that
's
a
*NL*
village
where
the
people
get
their
living
by
working
in
the
lead-mines
,
*NL*
and
where
there
's
no
church
nor
preacher
,
but
they
live
like
sheep
*NL*
without
a
shepherd
.
It
's
better
than
twelve
miles
from
Snowfield
,
so
*NL*
we
set
out
early
in
the
morning
,
for
it
was
summertime
;
and
I
had
a
*NL*
wonderful
sense
of
the
Divine
love
as
we
walked
over
the
hills
,
where
*NL*
there
's
no
trees
,
you
know
,
sir
,
as
there
is
here
,
to
make
the
sky
look
*NL*
smaller
,
but
you
see
the
heavens
stretched
out
like
a
tent
,
and
you
feel
*NL*
the
everlasting
arms
around
you
.
But
before
we
got
to
Hetton
,
brother
*NL*
Marlowe
was
seized
with
a
dizziness
that
made
him
afraid
of
falling
,
for
*NL*
he
overworked
himself
sadly
,
at
his
years
,
in
watching
and
praying
,
*NL*
and
walking
so
many
miles
to
speak
the
Word
,
as
well
as
carrying
on
his
*NL*
trade
of
linen-weaving
.
And
when
we
got
to
the
village
,
the
people
were
*NL*
expecting
him
,
for
he
'd
appointed
the
time
and
the
place
when
he
was
*NL*
there
before
,
and
such
of
them
as
cared
to
hear
the
Word
of
Life
were
*NL*
assembled
on
a
spot
where
the
cottages
was
thickest
,
so
as
others
might
*NL*
be
drawn
to
come
.
But
he
felt
as
he
could
n't
stand
up
to
preach
,
and
*NL*
he
was
forced
to
lie
down
in
the
first
of
the
cottages
we
came
to
.
So
I
*NL*
went
to
tell
the
people
,
thinking
we
'd
go
into
one
of
the
houses
,
and
I
*NL*
would
read
and
pray
with
them
.
But
as
I
passed
along
by
the
cottages
and
*NL*
saw
the
aged
and
trembling
women
at
the
doors
,
and
the
hard
looks
of
the
*NL*
men
,
who
seemed
to
have
their
eyes
no
more
filled
with
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
Sabbath
morning
than
if
they
had
been
dumb
oxen
that
never
looked
up
to
*NL*
the
sky
,
I
felt
a
great
movement
in
my
soul
,
and
I
trembled
as
if
I
*NL*
was
shaken
by
a
strong
spirit
entering
into
my
weak
body
.
And
I
went
to
*NL*
where
the
little
flock
of
people
was
gathered
together
,
and
stepped
on
*NL*
the
low
wall
that
was
built
against
the
green
hillside
,
and
I
spoke
the
*NL*
words
that
were
given
to
me
abundantly
.
And
they
all
came
round
me
out
*NL*
of
all
the
cottages
,
and
many
wept
over
their
sins
,
and
have
since
been
*NL*
joined
to
the
Lord
.
That
was
the
beginning
of
my
preaching
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
I
've
preached
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
had
let
her
work
fall
during
this
narrative
,
which
she
uttered
in
*NL*
her
usual
simple
way
,
but
with
that
sincere
articulate
,
thrilling
treble
*NL*
by
which
she
always
mastered
her
audience
.
She
stooped
now
to
gather
up
*NL*
her
sewing
,
and
then
went
on
with
it
as
before
.
Mr.
Irwine
was
deeply
*NL*
interested
.
He
said
to
himself
,
``
He
must
be
a
miserable
prig
who
would
*NL*
act
the
pedagogue
here
:
one
might
as
well
go
and
lecture
the
trees
for
*NL*
growing
in
their
own
shape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
never
feel
any
embarrassment
from
the
sense
of
your
youth
--
that
*NL*
you
are
a
lovely
young
woman
on
whom
men
's
eyes
are
fixed
?
''
he
said
*NL*
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
no
room
for
such
feelings
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
the
people
ever
*NL*
take
notice
about
that
.
I
think
,
sir
,
when
God
makes
His
presence
felt
*NL*
through
us
,
we
are
like
the
burning
bush
:
Moses
never
took
any
heed
*NL*
what
sort
of
bush
it
was
--
he
only
saw
the
brightness
of
the
Lord
.
I
've
*NL*
preached
to
as
rough
ignorant
people
as
can
be
in
the
villages
about
*NL*
Snowfield
--
men
that
looked
very
hard
and
wild
--
but
they
never
said
an
*NL*
uncivil
word
to
me
,
and
often
thanked
me
kindly
as
they
made
way
for
me
*NL*
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
THAT
I
can
believe
--
that
I
can
well
believe
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
*NL*
emphatically
.
``
And
what
did
you
think
of
your
hearers
last
night
,
now
?
*NL*
Did
you
find
them
quiet
and
attentive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
quiet
,
sir
,
but
I
saw
no
signs
of
any
great
work
upon
them
,
except
*NL*
in
a
young
girl
named
Bessy
Cranage
,
towards
whom
my
heart
yearned
*NL*
greatly
,
when
my
eyes
first
fell
on
her
blooming
youth
,
given
up
*NL*
to
folly
and
vanity
.
I
had
some
private
talk
and
prayer
with
her
*NL*
afterwards
,
and
I
trust
her
heart
is
touched
.
But
I
've
noticed
that
*NL*
in
these
villages
where
the
people
lead
a
quiet
life
among
the
green
*NL*
pastures
and
the
still
waters
,
tilling
the
ground
and
tending
the
*NL*
cattle
,
there
's
a
strange
deadness
to
the
Word
,
as
different
as
can
*NL*
be
from
the
great
towns
,
like
Leeds
,
where
I
once
went
to
visit
a
holy
*NL*
woman
who
preaches
there
.
It
's
wonderful
how
rich
is
the
harvest
of
*NL*
souls
up
those
high-walled
streets
,
where
you
seemed
to
walk
as
in
a
*NL*
prison-yard
,
and
the
ear
is
deafened
with
the
sounds
of
worldly
toil
.
*NL*
I
think
maybe
it
is
because
the
promise
is
sweeter
when
this
life
is
so
*NL*
dark
and
weary
,
and
the
soul
gets
more
hungry
when
the
body
is
ill
at
*NL*
ease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
our
farm-labourers
are
not
easily
roused
.
They
take
life
*NL*
almost
as
slowly
as
the
sheep
and
cows
.
But
we
have
some
intelligent
*NL*
workmen
about
here
.
I
daresay
you
know
the
Bedes
;
Seth
Bede
,
by
the
by
,
*NL*
is
a
Methodist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
Seth
well
,
and
his
brother
Adam
a
little
.
Seth
is
a
*NL*
gracious
young
man
--
sincere
and
without
offence
;
and
Adam
is
like
the
*NL*
patriarch
Joseph
,
for
his
great
skill
and
knowledge
and
the
kindness
he
*NL*
shows
to
his
brother
and
his
parents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
the
trouble
that
has
just
happened
to
them
?
*NL*
Their
father
,
Matthias
Bede
,
was
drowned
in
the
Willow
Brook
last
night
,
*NL*
not
far
from
his
own
door
.
I
'm
going
now
to
see
Adam
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
their
poor
aged
mother
!

said
Dinah
,
dropping
her
hands
and
looking
*NL*
before
her
with
pitying
eyes
,
as
if
she
saw
the
object
of
her
sympathy
.
*NL*
``
She
will
mourn
heavily
,
for
Seth
has
told
me
she
's
of
an
anxious
,
*NL*
troubled
heart
.
I
must
go
and
see
if
I
can
give
her
any
help
.

*NL*
*NL*
As
she
rose
and
was
beginning
to
fold
up
her
work
,
Captain
Donnithorne
,
*NL*
having
exhausted
all
plausible
pretexts
for
remaining
among
the
*NL*
milk-pans
,
came
out
of
the
dairy
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Poyser
.
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
now
rose
also
,
and
,
advancing
towards
Dinah
,
held
out
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Good-bye
.
I
hear
you
are
going
away
soon

this

not
be
*NL*
the
last
visit

will
pay
your

so
we
shall
meet
again

*NL*
*NL*
His
cordiality
towards
Dinah
set
all
Mrs.
Poyser
's
anxieties
at
rest
,
*NL*
and
her
face
was
brighter
than
usual
,
as
she
said
,
``

've
never
asked
*NL*
after
Mrs.
Irwine

the
Miss

*NL*
``

some
beautiful

mounting

*NL*
*NL*
``

mounting
also

Good-bye

shall
come

have
a
long
talk

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
curtsied
duly
,
and
watched
the
two
horses
until
they
had
*NL*
disappeared
from
the
yard
,
amidst
great
excitement
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
pigs
and
the
poultry
,
and
under
the
furious
indignation
of
the
bull-dog
,
*NL*
who
performed
a
Pyrrhic
dance
,
that
every
moment
seemed
to
threaten
the
*NL*
breaking
of
his
chain
.
Mrs.
Poyser
delighted
in
this
noisy
exit
;
it
was
*NL*
a
fresh
assurance
to
her
that
the
farm-yard
was
well
guarded
,
and
that
*NL*
no
loiterers
could
enter
unobserved
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
gate
had
*NL*
closed
behind
the
captain
that
she
turned
into
the
kitchen
again
,
where
*NL*
Dinah
stood
with
her
bonnet
in
her
hand
,
waiting
to
speak
to
her
aunt
,
*NL*
before
she
set
out
for
Lisbeth
Bede
's
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
however
,
though
she
noticed
the
bonnet
,
deferred
remarking
*NL*
on
it
until
she
had
disburdened
herself
of
her
surprise
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
*NL*
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
n't
angry
,
then

What
did
he
say
to
you

Did
n't
he
scold
you
for
preaching
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
was
not
at
all
angry

he
was
very
friendly
to
me

I
was
quite
*NL*
drawn
out
to
speak
to
him
;
I
hardly
know
how
,
for
I
had
always
thought
*NL*
of
him
as
a
worldly
Sadducee
.
But
his
countenance
is
as
pleasant
as
the
*NL*
morning
sunshine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasant

And
what
else
did
y

expect
to
find
him

pleasant

said
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
impatiently
,
resuming
her
knitting
.
``
I
should
think
his
*NL*
countenance
is
pleasant
indeed

And
him
a
gentleman
born

's
got
a
*NL*
mother
like
a
picter

You
may
go
the
country
round
and
not
find
such
*NL*
another
woman
turned
sixty-six

It
's
summat-like
to
see
such
a
man
as
*NL*
that
i
'
the
desk
of
a
Sunday
!
As
I
say
to
Poyser
,
it
's
like
looking
at
*NL*
a
full
crop
o
'
wheat
,
or
a
pasture
with
a
fine
dairy
o
'
cows
in
it
;
it
*NL*
makes
you
think
the
world
's
comfortable-like

But
as
for
such
creaturs
*NL*
as
you
Methodisses
run
after
,
I
'd
as
soon
go
to
look
at
a
lot
o

*NL*
bare-ribbed
runts
on
a
common

Fine
folks
they
are
to
tell
you
what
's
*NL*
right

as
look
as
if
they
'd
never
tasted
nothing
better
than
bacon-sword
*NL*
and
sour-cake
i
'
their
lives
.
But
what
did
Mr.
Irwine
say
to
you
about
*NL*
that
fool
's
trick
o
'
preaching
on
the
Green
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
only
said
he
'd
heard
of
it
;
he
did
n't
seem
to
feel
any
displeasure
*NL*
about
it
.
But
,
dear
aunt
,
do
n't
think
any
more
about
that
.
He
told
me
*NL*
something
that
I
'm
sure
will
cause
you
sorrow
,
as
it
does
me
.
Thias
Bede
*NL*
was
drowned
last
night
in
the
Willow
Brook
,
and
I
'm
thinking
that
the
*NL*
aged
mother
will
be
greatly
in
need
of
comfort
.
Perhaps
I
can
be
of
use
*NL*
to
her
,
so
I
have
fetched
my
bonnet
and
am
going
to
set
out

Mrs.

falling
at

from

with
five

tell
which
is
which
by
the
*NL*
look
and
the
smell
.
But
as
to
Thias
Bede
,
he
's
better
out
o
'
the
way
nor
*NL*
in
--
God
forgi
'
me
for
saying
so
--
for
he
's
done
little
this
ten
year
but
*NL*
make
trouble
for
them
as
belonged
to
him
;
and
I
think
it
`
ud
be
well
*NL*
for
you
to
take
a
little
bottle
o
'
rum
for
th
'
old
woman
,
for
I
daresay
*NL*
she
's
got
never
a
drop
o
'
nothing
to
comfort
her
inside
.
Sit
down
,
*NL*
child
,
and
be
easy
,
for
you
sha
n't
stir
out
till
you
've
had
a
cup
o
'
*NL*
tea
,
and
so
I
tell
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
During
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
Mrs.
Poyser
had
been
reaching
*NL*
down
the
tea-things
from
the
shelves
,
and
was
on
her
way
towards
*NL*
the
pantry
for
the
loaf
-LRB-
followed
close
by
Totty
,
who
had
made
her
*NL*
appearance
on
the
rattling
of
the
tea-cups
-RRB-
,
when
Hetty
came
out
of
*NL*
the
dairy
relieving
her
tired
arms
by
lifting
them
up
,
and
clasping
her
*NL*
hands
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Molly
,
''
she
said
,
rather
languidly
,
``
just
run
out
and
get
me
a
bunch
of
*NL*
dock-leaves
:
the
butter
's
ready
to
pack
up
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'
you
hear
what
's
happened
,
Hetty
?
''
said
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
how
should
I
hear
anything
?
''
was
the
answer
,
in
a
pettish
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
you
'd
care
much
,
I
daresay
,
if
you
did
hear
;
for
you
're
too
*NL*
feather-headed
to
mind
if
everybody
was
dead
,
so
as
you
could
stay
*NL*
upstairs
a-dressing
yourself
for
two
hours
by
the
clock
.
But
anybody
*NL*
besides
yourself
`
ud
mind
about
such
things
happening
to
them
as
think
*NL*
a
deal
more
of
you
than
you
deserve
.
But
Adam
Bede
and
all
his
kin
might
*NL*
be
drownded
for
what
you
'd
care
--
you
'd
be
perking
at
the
glass
the
next
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
Bede
--
drowned
?
''
said
Hetty
,
letting
her
arms
fall
and
looking
*NL*
rather
bewildered
,
but
suspecting
that
her
aunt
was
as
usual
*NL*
exaggerating
with
a
didactic
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
no
,
''
said
Dinah
kindly
,
for
Mrs.
Poyser
had
passed
on
to
*NL*
the
pantry
without
deigning
more
precise
information
.
``
Not
Adam
.
Adam
's
*NL*
father
,
the
old
man
,
is
drowned
.
He
was
drowned
last
night
in
the
Willow
*NL*
Brook
.
Mr.
Irwine
has
just
told
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
dreadful
!
''
said
Hetty
,
looking
serious
,
but
not
deeply
*NL*
affected
;
and
as
Molly
now
entered
with
the
dock-leaves
,
she
took
them
*NL*
silently
and
returned
to
the
dairy
without
asking
further
questions
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
's
World
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WHILE
she
adjusted
the
broad
leaves
that
set
off
the
pale
fragrant
*NL*
butter
as
the
primrose
is
set
off
by
its
nest
of
green
I
am
afraid
Hetty
*NL*
was
thinking
a
great
deal
more
of
the
looks
Captain
Donnithorne
had
cast
*NL*
at
her
than
of
Adam
and
his
troubles
.
Bright
,
admiring
glances
from
*NL*
a
handsome
young
gentleman
with
white
hands
,
a
gold
chain
,
occasional
*NL*
regimentals
,
and
wealth
and
grandeur
immeasurable
--
those
were
the
*NL*
warm
rays
that
set
poor
Hetty
's
heart
vibrating
and
playing
its
little
*NL*
foolish
tunes
over
and
over
again
.
We
do
not
hear
that
Memnon
's
statue
*NL*
gave
forth
its
melody
at
all
under
the
rushing
of
the
mightiest
wind
,
*NL*
or
in
response
to
any
other
influence
divine
or
human
than
certain
*NL*
short-lived
sunbeams
of
morning
;
and
we
must
learn
to
accommodate
*NL*
ourselves
to
the
discovery
that
some
of
those
cunningly
fashioned
*NL*
instruments
called
human
souls
have
only
a
very
limited
range
of
music
,
*NL*
and
will
not
vibrate
in
the
least
under
a
touch
that
fills
others
with
*NL*
tremulous
rapture
or
quivering
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
quite
used
to
the
thought
that
people
liked
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
She
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
young
Luke
Britton
of
Broxton
came
to
*NL*
Hayslope
Church
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
on
purpose
that
he
might
see
her
;
*NL*
and
that
he
would
have
made
much
more
decided
advances
if
her
uncle
*NL*
Poyser
,
thinking
but
lightly
of
a
young
man
whose
father
's
land
was
so
*NL*
foul
as
old
Luke
Britton
's
,
had
not
forbidden
her
aunt
to
encourage
him
*NL*
by
any
civilities
.
She
was
aware
,
too
,
that
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
at
*NL*
the
Chase
,
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
,
and
had
lately
made
*NL*
unmistakable
avowals
in
luscious
strawberries
and
hyperbolical
peas
.
*NL*
She
knew
still
better
,
that
Adam
Bede
--
tall
,
upright
,
clever
,
brave
Adam
*NL*
Bede
--
who
carried
such
authority
with
all
the
people
round
about
,
and
*NL*
whom
her
uncle
was
always
delighted
to
see
of
an
evening
,
saying
that
*NL*
``
Adam
knew
a
fine
sight
more
o
'
the
natur
o
'
things
than
those
as
*NL*
thought
themselves
his
betters
''
--
she
knew
that
this
Adam
,
who
was
often
*NL*
rather
stern
to
other
people
and
not
much
given
to
run
after
the
lasses
,
*NL*
could
be
made
to
turn
pale
or
red
any
day
by
a
word
or
a
look
from
*NL*
her
.
Hetty
's
sphere
of
comparison
was
not
large
,
but
she
could
n't
help
*NL*
perceiving
that
Adam
was
``
something
like
''
a
man
;
always
knew
what
to
say
*NL*
about
things
,
could
tell
her
uncle
how
to
prop
the
hovel
,
and
had
mended
*NL*
the
churn
in
no
time
;
knew
,
with
only
looking
at
it
,
the
value
of
the
*NL*
chestnut-tree
that
was
blown
down
,
and
why
the
damp
came
in
the
walls
,
*NL*
and
what
they
must
do
to
stop
the
rats
;
and
wrote
a
beautiful
hand
*NL*
that
you
could
read
off
,
and
could
do
figures
in
his
head
--
a
degree
*NL*
of
accomplishment
totally
unknown
among
the
richest
farmers
of
that
*NL*
countryside
.
Not
at
all
like
that
slouching
Luke
Britton
,
who
,
when
*NL*
she
once
walked
with
him
all
the
way
from
Broxton
to
Hayslope
,
had
only
*NL*
broken
silence
to
remark
that
the
grey
goose
had
begun
to
lay
.
And
as
*NL*
for
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
he
was
a
sensible
man
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
*NL*
but
he
was
knock-kneed
,
and
had
a
queer
sort
of
sing-song
in
his
talk
;
*NL*
moreover
,
on
the
most
charitable
supposition
,
he
must
be
far
on
the
way
*NL*
to
forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
quite
certain
her
uncle
wanted
her
to
encourage
Adam
,
and
*NL*
would
be
pleased
for
her
to
marry
him
.
For
those
were
times
when
there
*NL*
was
no
rigid
demarcation
of
rank
between
the
farmer
and
the
respectable
*NL*
artisan
,
and
on
the
home
hearth
,
as
well
as
in
the
public
house
,
they
*NL*
might
be
seen
taking
their
jug
of
ale
together
;
the
farmer
having
*NL*
a
latent
sense
of
capital
,
and
of
weight
in
parish
affairs
,
which
*NL*
sustained
him
under
his
conspicuous
inferiority
in
conversation
.
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
was
not
a
frequenter
of
public
houses
,
but
he
liked
a
friendly
*NL*
chat
over
his
own
home-brewed
;
and
though
it
was
pleasant
to
lay
down
*NL*
the
law
to
a
stupid
neighbour
who
had
no
notion
how
to
make
the
best
*NL*
of
his
farm
,
it
was
also
an
agreeable
variety
to
learn
something
from
*NL*
a
clever
fellow
like
Adam
Bede
.
Accordingly
,
for
the
last
three
*NL*
years
--
ever
since
he
had
superintended
the
building
of
the
new
*NL*
barn
--
Adam
had
always
been
made
welcome
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
especially
of
*NL*
a
winter
evening
,
when
the
whole
family
,
in
patriarchal
fashion
,
master
*NL*
and
mistress
,
children
and
servants
,
were
assembled
in
that
glorious
*NL*
kitchen
,
at
well-graduated
distances
from
the
blazing
fire
.
And
for
the
*NL*
last
two
years
,
at
least
,
Hetty
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hearing
her
*NL*
uncle
say
,
``
Adam
Bede
may
be
working
for
wage
now
,
but
he
'll
be
a
*NL*
master-man
some
day
,
as
sure
as
I
sit
in
this
chair
.
Mester
Burge
is
*NL*
in
the
right
o
n't
to
want
him
to
go
partners
and
marry
his
daughter
,
if
*NL*
it
's
true
what
they
say
;
the
woman
as
marries
him
`
ull
have
a
good
take
,
*NL*
be
'
t
Lady
day
or
Michaelmas
,
''
a
remark
which
Mrs.
Poyser
always
followed
*NL*
up
with
her
cordial
assent
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
it
's
all
very
fine
*NL*
having
a
ready-made
rich
man
,
but
mayhappen
he
'll
be
a
ready-made
fool
;
*NL*
and
it
's
no
use
filling
your
pocket
full
o
'
money
if
you
've
got
a
hole
*NL*
in
the
corner
.
It
'll
do
you
no
good
to
sit
in
a
spring-cart
o
'
your
own
,
*NL*
if
you
've
got
a
soft
to
drive
you
:
he
'll
soon
turn
you
over
into
the
*NL*
ditch
.
I
allays
said
I
'd
never
marry
a
man
as
had
got
no
brains
;
for
*NL*
where
's
the
use
of
a
woman
having
brains
of
her
own
if
she
's
tackled
*NL*
to
a
geck
as
everybody
's
a-laughing
at
?
She
might
as
well
dress
herself
*NL*
fine
to
sit
back
`
ards
on
a
donkey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
expressions
,
though
figurative
,
sufficiently
indicated
the
bent
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
's
mind
with
regard
to
Adam
;
and
though
she
and
her
husband
*NL*
might
have
viewed
the
subject
differently
if
Hetty
had
been
a
daughter
*NL*
of
their
own
,
it
was
clear
that
they
would
have
welcomed
the
match
with
*NL*
Adam
for
a
penniless
niece
.
For
what
could
Hetty
have
been
but
a
servant
*NL*
elsewhere
,
if
her
uncle
had
not
taken
her
in
and
brought
her
up
as
a
*NL*
domestic
help
to
her
aunt
,
whose
health
since
the
birth
of
Totty
had
not
*NL*
been
equal
to
more
positive
labour
than
the
superintendence
of
servants
*NL*
and
children
?
But
Hetty
had
never
given
Adam
any
steady
encouragement
.
*NL*
Even
in
the
moments
when
she
was
most
thoroughly
conscious
of
his
*NL*
superiority
to
her
other
admirers
,
she
had
never
brought
herself
to
*NL*
think
of
accepting
him
.
She
liked
to
feel
that
this
strong
,
skilful
,
*NL*
keen-eyed
man
was
in
her
power
,
and
would
have
been
indignant
if
he
had
*NL*
shown
the
least
sign
of
slipping
from
under
the
yoke
of
her
coquettish
*NL*
tyranny
and
attaching
himself
to
the
gentle
Mary
Burge
,
who
would
have
*NL*
been
grateful
enough
for
the
most
trifling
notice
from
him
.
``
Mary
Burge
,
*NL*
indeed
!
Such
a
sallow-faced
girl
:
if
she
put
on
a
bit
of
pink
ribbon
,
*NL*
she
looked
as
yellow
as
a
crow-flower
and
her
hair
was
as
straight
as
a
*NL*
hank
of
cotton
.
''
And
always
when
Adam
stayed
away
for
several
weeks
from
*NL*
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
otherwise
made
some
show
of
resistance
to
his
passion
*NL*
as
a
foolish
one
,
Hetty
took
care
to
entice
him
back
into
the
net
by
*NL*
little
airs
of
meekness
and
timidity
,
as
if
she
were
in
trouble
at
his
*NL*
neglect
.
But
as
to
marrying
Adam
,
that
was
a
very
different
affair
!
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
tempt
her
to
do
that
.
Her
cheeks
never
*NL*
grew
a
shade
deeper
when
his
name
was
mentioned
;
she
felt
no
thrill
*NL*
when
she
saw
him
passing
along
the
causeway
by
the
window
,
or
advancing
*NL*
towards
her
unexpectedly
in
the
footpath
across
the
meadow
;
she
felt
*NL*
nothing
,
when
his
eyes
rested
on
her
,
but
the
cold
triumph
of
knowing
*NL*
that
he
loved
her
and
would
not
care
to
look
at
Mary
Burge
.
He
could
no
*NL*
more
stir
in
her
the
emotions
that
make
the
sweet
intoxication
of
young
*NL*
love
than
the
mere
picture
of
a
sun
can
stir
the
spring
sap
in
the
*NL*
subtle
fibres
of
the
plant
.
She
saw
him
as
he
was
--
a
poor
man
with
old
*NL*
parents
to
keep
,
who
would
not
be
able
,
for
a
long
while
to
come
,
to
*NL*
give
her
even
such
luxuries
as
she
shared
in
her
uncle
's
house
.
And
*NL*
Hetty
's
dreams
were
all
of
luxuries
:
to
sit
in
a
carpeted
parlour
,
and
*NL*
always
wear
white
stockings
;
to
have
some
large
beautiful
ear-rings
,
*NL*
such
as
were
all
the
fashion
;
to
have
Nottingham
lace
round
the
top
of
*NL*
her
gown
,
and
something
to
make
her
handkerchief
smell
nice
,
like
*NL*
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
's
when
she
drew
it
out
at
church
;
and
not
to
be
*NL*
obliged
to
get
up
early
or
be
scolded
by
anybody
.
She
thought
,
if
Adam
*NL*
had
been
rich
and
could
have
given
her
these
things
,
she
loved
him
well
*NL*
enough
to
marry
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
the
last
few
weeks
a
new
influence
had
come
over
Hetty
--
vague
,
*NL*
atmospheric
,
shaping
itself
into
no
self-confessed
hopes
or
prospects
,
*NL*
but
producing
a
pleasant
narcotic
effect
,
making
her
tread
the
ground
*NL*
and
go
about
her
work
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
unconscious
of
weight
or
*NL*
effort
,
and
showing
her
all
things
through
a
soft
,
liquid
veil
,
as
if
*NL*
she
were
living
not
in
this
solid
world
of
brick
and
stone
,
but
in
a
*NL*
beatified
world
,
such
as
the
sun
lights
up
for
us
in
the
waters
.
Hetty
*NL*
had
become
aware
that
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
take
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
for
the
chance
of
seeing
her
;
that
he
always
placed
himself
at
*NL*
church
so
as
to
have
the
fullest
view
of
her
both
sitting
and
standing
;
*NL*
that
he
was
constantly
finding
reason
for
calling
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
*NL*
always
would
contrive
to
say
something
for
the
sake
of
making
her
speak
*NL*
to
him
and
look
at
him
.
The
poor
child
no
more
conceived
at
present
the
*NL*
idea
that
the
young
squire
could
ever
be
her
lover
than
a
baker
's
pretty
*NL*
daughter
in
the
crowd
,
whom
a
young
emperor
distinguishes
by
an
imperial
*NL*
but
admiring
smile
,
conceives
that
she
shall
be
made
empress
.
But
the
*NL*
baker
's
daughter
goes
home
and
dreams
of
the
handsome
young
emperor
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
weighs
the
flour
amiss
while
she
is
thinking
what
a
heavenly
lot
*NL*
it
must
be
to
have
him
for
a
husband
.
And
so
,
poor
Hetty
had
got
a
face
*NL*
and
a
presence
haunting
her
waking
and
sleeping
dreams
;
bright
,
soft
*NL*
glances
had
penetrated
her
,
and
suffused
her
life
with
a
strange
,
happy
*NL*
languor
.
The
eyes
that
shed
those
glances
were
really
not
half
so
*NL*
fine
as
Adam
's
,
which
sometimes
looked
at
her
with
a
sad
,
beseeching
*NL*
tenderness
,
but
they
had
found
a
ready
medium
in
Hetty
's
little
*NL*
silly
imagination
,
whereas
Adam
's
could
get
no
entrance
through
that
*NL*
atmosphere
.
For
three
weeks
,
at
least
,
her
inward
life
had
consisted
of
*NL*
little
else
than
living
through
in
memory
the
looks
and
words
Arthur
had
*NL*
directed
towards
her
--
of
little
else
than
recalling
the
sensations
with
*NL*
which
she
heard
his
voice
outside
the
house
,
and
saw
him
enter
,
and
*NL*
became
conscious
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
,
and
then
became
*NL*
conscious
that
a
tall
figure
,
looking
down
on
her
with
eyes
that
seemed
*NL*
to
touch
her
,
was
coming
nearer
in
clothes
of
beautiful
texture
with
an
*NL*
odour
like
that
of
a
flower-garden
borne
on
the
evening
breeze
.
Foolish
*NL*
thoughts
!
But
all
this
happened
,
you
must
remember
,
nearly
sixty
years
*NL*
ago
,
and
Hetty
was
quite
uneducated
--
a
simple
farmer
's
girl
,
to
whom
*NL*
a
gentleman
with
a
white
hand
was
dazzling
as
an
Olympian
god
.
Until
*NL*
to-day
,
she
had
never
looked
farther
into
the
future
than
to
the
next
*NL*
time
Captain
Donnithorne
would
come
to
the
Farm
,
or
the
next
Sunday
when
*NL*
she
should
see
him
at
church
;
but
now
she
thought
,
perhaps
he
would
try
*NL*
to
meet
her
when
she
went
to
the
Chase
to-morrow
--
and
if
he
should
*NL*
speak
to
her
,
and
walk
a
little
way
,
when
nobody
was
by
!
That
had
never
*NL*
happened
yet
;
and
now
her
imagination
,
instead
of
retracing
the
past
,
*NL*
was
busy
fashioning
what
would
happen
to-morrow
--
whereabout
in
the
*NL*
Chase
she
should
see
him
coming
towards
her
,
how
she
should
put
her
new
*NL*
rose-coloured
ribbon
on
,
which
he
had
never
seen
,
and
what
he
would
say
*NL*
to
her
to
make
her
return
his
glance
--
a
glance
which
she
would
be
living
*NL*
through
in
her
memory
,
over
and
over
again
,
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
,
how
could
Hetty
give
any
feeling
to
Adam
's
*NL*
troubles
,
or
think
much
about
poor
old
Thias
being
drowned
?
Young
souls
,
*NL*
in
such
pleasant
delirium
as
hers
are
as
unsympathetic
as
butterflies
*NL*
sipping
nectar
;
they
are
isolated
from
all
appeals
by
a
barrier
of
*NL*
dreams
--
by
invisible
looks
and
impalpable
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Hetty
's
hands
were
busy
packing
up
the
butter
,
and
her
head
filled
*NL*
with
these
pictures
of
the
morrow
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
riding
by
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
's
side
towards
the
valley
of
the
Willow
Brook
,
had
also
certain
*NL*
indistinct
anticipations
,
running
as
an
undercurrent
in
his
mind
while
*NL*
he
was
listening
to
Mr.
Irwine
's
account
of
Dinah
--
indistinct
,
yet
*NL*
strong
enough
to
make
him
feel
rather
conscious
when
Mr.
Irwine
suddenly
*NL*
said
,
``
What
fascinated
you
so
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
dairy
,
Arthur
?
Have
you
*NL*
become
an
amateur
of
damp
quarries
and
skimming
dishes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
knew
the
rector
too
well
to
suppose
that
a
clever
invention
would
*NL*
be
of
any
use
,
so
he
said
,
with
his
accustomed
frankness
,
``
No
,
I
went
to
*NL*
look
at
the
pretty
butter-maker
Hetty
Sorrel
.
She
's
a
perfect
Hebe
;
and
*NL*
if
I
were
an
artist
,
I
would
paint
her
.
It
's
amazing
what
pretty
girls
*NL*
one
sees
among
the
farmers
'
daughters
,
when
the
men
are
such
clowns
.
*NL*
That
common
,
round
,
red
face
one
sees
sometimes
in
the
men
--
all
cheek
*NL*
and
no
features
,
like
Martin
Poyser
's
--
comes
out
in
the
women
of
the
*NL*
family
as
the
most
charming
phiz
imaginable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
no
objection
to
your
contemplating
Hetty
in
an
artistic
*NL*
light
,
but
I
must
not
have
you
feeding
her
vanity
and
filling
her
little
*NL*
noddle
with
the
notion
that
she
's
a
great
beauty
,
attractive
to
fine
*NL*
gentlemen
,
or
you
will
spoil
her
for
a
poor
man
's
wife
--
honest
Craig
's
,
*NL*
for
example
,
whom
I
have
seen
bestowing
soft
glances
on
her
.
The
little
*NL*
puss
seems
already
to
have
airs
enough
to
make
a
husband
as
miserable
*NL*
as
it
's
a
law
of
nature
for
a
quiet
man
to
be
when
he
marries
a
beauty
.
*NL*
Apropos
of
marrying
,
I
hope
our
friend
Adam
will
get
settled
,
now
the
*NL*
poor
old
man
's
gone
.
He
will
only
have
his
mother
to
keep
in
future
,
and
*NL*
I
've
a
notion
that
there
's
a
kindness
between
him
and
that
nice
modest
*NL*
girl
,
Mary
Burge
,
from
something
that
fell
from
old
Jonathan
one
day
*NL*
when
I
was
talking
to
him
.
But
when
I
mentioned
the
subject
to
Adam
he
*NL*
looked
uneasy
and
turned
the
conversation
.
I
suppose
the
love-making
*NL*
does
n't
run
smooth
,
or
perhaps
Adam
hangs
back
till
he
's
in
a
better
*NL*
position
.
He
has
independence
of
spirit
enough
for
two
men
--
rather
an
*NL*
excess
of
pride
,
if
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
a
capital
match
for
Adam
.
He
would
slip
into
old
Burge
's
*NL*
shoes
and
make
a
fine
thing
of
that
building
business
,
I
'll
answer
for
*NL*
him
.
I
should
like
to
see
him
well
settled
in
this
parish
;
he
would
be
*NL*
ready
then
to
act
as
my
grand-vizier
when
I
wanted
one
.
We
could
plan
*NL*
no
end
of
repairs
and
improvements
together
.
I
've
never
seen
the
girl
,
*NL*
though
,
I
think
--
at
least
I
've
never
looked
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
her
next
Sunday
at
church
--
she
sits
with
her
father
on
the
*NL*
left
of
the
reading-desk
.
You
need
n't
look
quite
so
much
at
Hetty
Sorrel
*NL*
then
.
When
I
've
made
up
my
mind
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
buy
a
tempting
*NL*
dog
,
I
take
no
notice
of
him
,
because
if
he
took
a
strong
fancy
to
*NL*
me
and
looked
lovingly
at
me
,
the
struggle
between
arithmetic
and
*NL*
inclination
might
become
unpleasantly
severe
.
I
pique
myself
on
my
*NL*
wisdom
there
,
Arthur
,
and
as
an
old
fellow
to
whom
wisdom
had
become
*NL*
cheap
,
I
bestow
it
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
It
may
stand
me
in
good
stead
some
day
though
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
that
I
have
any
present
use
for
it
.
Bless
me
!
How
the
brook
has
*NL*
overflowed
.
Suppose
we
have
a
canter
,
now
we
're
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
the
great
advantage
of
dialogue
on
horseback
;
it
can
be
merged
*NL*
any
minute
into
a
trot
or
a
canter
,
and
one
might
have
escaped
from
*NL*
Socrates
himself
in
the
saddle
.
The
two
friends
were
free
from
the
*NL*
necessity
of
further
conversation
till
they
pulled
up
in
the
lane
behind
*NL*
Adam

cottage

*NL*
Chapter
X
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
Visits
Lisbeth
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AT
five
o'clock
Lisbeth
came
downstairs
with
a
large
key
in
her
hand
:
*NL*
it
was
the
key
of
the
chamber
where
her
husband
lay
dead
.
Throughout
the
*NL*
day
,
except
in
her
occasional
outbursts
of
wailing
grief
,
she
had
been
*NL*
in
incessant
movement
,
performing
the
initial
duties
to
her
dead
with
*NL*
the
awe
and
exactitude
that
belong
to
religious
rites
.
She
had
brought
*NL*
out
her
little
store
of
bleached
linen
,
which
she
had
for
long
years
*NL*
kept
in
reserve
for
this
supreme
use
.
It
seemed
but
yesterday
--
that
time
*NL*
so
many
midsummers
ago
,
when
she
had
told
Thias
where
this
linen
lay
,
*NL*
that
he
might
be
sure
and
reach
it
out
for
her
when
SHE
died
,
for
she
*NL*
was
the
elder
of
the
two
.
Then
there
had
been
the
work
of
cleansing
to
*NL*
the
strictest
purity
every
object
in
the
sacred
chamber
,
and
of
removing
*NL*
from
it
every
trace
of
common
daily
occupation
.
The
small
window
,
which
*NL*
had
hitherto
freely
let
in
the
frosty
moonlight
or
the
warm
summer
*NL*
sunrise
on
the
working
man
's
slumber
,
must
now
be
darkened
with
a
fair
*NL*
white
sheet
,
for
this
was
the
sleep
which
is
as
sacred
under
the
bare
*NL*
rafters
as
in
ceiled
houses
.
Lisbeth
had
even
mended
a
long-neglected
*NL*
and
unnoticeable
rent
in
the
checkered
bit
of
bed-curtain
;
for
the
*NL*
moments
were
few
and
precious
now
in
which
she
would
be
able
to
do
the
*NL*
smallest
office
of
respect
or
love
for
the
still
corpse
,
to
which
in
all
*NL*
her
thoughts
she
attributed
some
consciousness
.
Our
dead
are
never
dead
*NL*
to
us
until
we
have
forgotten
them
:
they
can
be
injured
by
us
,
they
can
*NL*
be
wounded
;
they
know
all
our
penitence
,
all
our
aching
sense
that
their
*NL*
place
is
empty
,
all
the
kisses
we
bestow
on
the
smallest
relic
of
their
*NL*
presence
.
And
the
aged
peasant
woman
most
of
all
believes
that
her
dead
*NL*
are
conscious
.
Decent
burial
was
what
Lisbeth
had
been
thinking
of
for
*NL*
herself
through
years
of
thrift
,
with
an
indistinct
expectation
that
she
*NL*
should
know
when
she
was
being
carried
to
the
churchyard
,
followed
by
*NL*
her
husband
and
her
sons
;
and
now
she
felt
as
if
the
greatest
work
of
*NL*
her
life
were
to
be
done
in
seeing
that
Thias
was
buried
decently
before
*NL*
her
--
under
the
white
thorn
,
where
once
,
in
a
dream
,
she
had
thought
she
*NL*
lay
in
the
coffin
,
yet
all
the
while
saw
the
sunshine
above
and
smelt
*NL*
the
white
blossoms
that
were
so
thick
upon
the
thorn
the
Sunday
she
went
*NL*
to
be
churched
after
Adam
was
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
she
had
done
everything
that
could
be
done
to-day
in
the
chamber
*NL*
of
death
--
had
done
it
all
herself
,
with
some
aid
from
her
sons
in
*NL*
lifting
,
for
she
would
let
no
one
be
fetched
to
help
her
from
the
*NL*
village
,
not
being
fond
of
female
neighbours
generally
;
and
her
*NL*
favourite
Dolly
,
the
old
housekeeper
at
Mr.
Burge
's
,
who
had
come
to
*NL*
condole
with
her
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
Thias
's
death
,
*NL*
was
too
dim-sighted
to
be
of
much
use
.
She
had
locked
the
door
,
and
now
*NL*
held
the
key
in
her
hand
,
as
she
threw
herself
wearily
into
a
chair
*NL*
that
stood
out
of
its
place
in
the
middle
of
the
house
floor
,
where
in
*NL*
ordinary
times
she
would
never
have
consented
to
sit
.
The
kitchen
had
*NL*
had
none
of
her
attention
that
day
;
it
was
soiled
with
the
tread
of
*NL*
muddy
shoes
and
untidy
with
clothes
and
other
objects
out
of
place
.
But
*NL*
what
at
another
time
would
have
been
intolerable
to
Lisbeth
's
habits
*NL*
of
order
and
cleanliness
seemed
to
her
now
just
what
should
be
:
it
was
*NL*
right
that
things
should
look
strange
and
disordered
and
wretched
,
now
*NL*
the
old
man
had
come
to
his
end
in
that
sad
way
;
the
kitchen
ought
not
*NL*
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
Adam
,
overcome
with
the
agitations
*NL*
and
exertions
of
the
day
after
his
night
of
hard
work
,
had
fallen
asleep
*NL*
on
a
bench
in
the
workshop
;
and
Seth
was
in
the
back
kitchen
making
a
*NL*
fire
of
sticks
that
he
might
get
the
kettle
to
boil
,
and
persuade
his
*NL*
mother
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
an
indulgence
which
she
rarely
allowed
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
when
Lisbeth
entered
and
threw
herself
*NL*
into
the
chair
.
She
looked
round
with
blank
eyes
at
the
dirt
and
*NL*
confusion
on
which
the
bright
afternoon
's
sun
shone
dismally
;
it
was
*NL*
all
of
a
piece
with
the
sad
confusion
of
her
mind
--
that
confusion
which
*NL*
belongs
to
the
first
hours
of
a
sudden
sorrow
,
when
the
poor
human
soul
*NL*
is
like
one
who
has
been
deposited
sleeping
among
the
ruins
of
a
vast
*NL*
city
,
and
wakes
up
in
dreary
amazement
,
not
knowing
whether
it
is
*NL*
the
growing
or
the
dying
day
--
not
knowing
why
and
whence
came
this
*NL*
illimitable
scene
of
desolation
,
or
why
he
too
finds
himself
desolate
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
Lisbeth
's
first
thought
would
have
been
,
``
Where
is
*NL*
Adam
?
''
but
the
sudden
death
of
her
husband
had
restored
him
in
*NL*
these
hours
to
that
first
place
in
her
affections
which
he
had
held
*NL*
six-and-twenty
years
ago
.
She
had
forgotten
his
faults
as
we
forget
the
*NL*
sorrows
of
our
departed
childhood
,
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
young
*NL*
husband
's
kindness
and
the
old
man
's
patience
.
Her
eyes
continued
*NL*
to
wander
blankly
until
Seth
came
in
and
began
to
remove
some
of
the
*NL*
scattered
things
,
and
clear
the
small
round
deal
table
that
he
might
set
*NL*
out
his
mother
's
tea
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
art
goin
'
to
do
?
''
she
said
,
rather
peevishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
thee
to
have
a
cup
of
tea

Mother

''
answered
Seth
,
tenderly
.
*NL*
``
It
'll
do
thee
good
;
and
I
'll
put
two
or
three
of
these
things
away

and
*NL*
make
the

more
comfortable

*NL*
*NL*
``
Comfortable

There

she
went
on
,
the
tears
coming
*NL*
when
she
began
to
speak
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Lisbeth
broke
from
words
into
moans
,
swaying
herself
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
on
her
chair
.
Seth
,
always
timid
in
his
behaviour
towards
his
*NL*
mother
,
from
the
sense
that
he
had
no
influence
over
her
,
felt
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
attempt
to
persuade
or
soothe
her
till
this
passion
was
past
;
*NL*
so
he
contented
himself
with
tending
the
back
kitchen
fire
and
folding
*NL*
up
his
father
's
clothes
,
which
had
been
hanging
out
to
dry
since
*NL*
morning
--
afraid
to
move
about
in
the
room
where
his
mother
was
,
lest
he
*NL*
should
irritate
her
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
Lisbeth
had
been
rocking
herself
and
moaning
for
some
minutes
,
*NL*
she
suddenly
paused
and
said
aloud
to
herself
,
``
I
'll
go
an
'
see
arter
*NL*
Adam
,
for
I
canna
think
where
he
's
gotten
;
an
'
I
want
him
to
go
upstairs
*NL*
wi
'
me
afore
it
's
dark
,
for
the
minutes
to
look
at
the
corpse
is
like
*NL*
the
meltin
'
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
overheard
this
,
and
coming
into
the
kitchen
again
,
as
his
mother
*NL*
rose
from
her
chair
,
he
said
,
``
Adam
's
asleep
in
the
workshop
,
mother
.
*NL*
Thee
`
dst
better
not
wake
him
.
He
was
o'erwrought
with
work
and
trouble

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake

Who
's
a-goin

to

I
shanna
wake
him
wi
'
lookin
'
at
*NL*
him
.
I
hanna
seen
the
lad
this
two
hour
--
I
'd
welly
forgot
as
he
'd
e'er
*NL*
growed
up
from
a
babby
when
's
feyther
carried
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
seated
on
a
rough
bench
,
his
head
supported
by
his
arm
,
which
*NL*
rested
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
on
the
long
planing-table
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
workshop
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
had
sat
down
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
'
rest
and
had
fallen
asleep
without
slipping
from
his
first
*NL*
attitude
of
sad
,
fatigued
thought
.
His
face
,
unwashed
since
yesterday
,
*NL*
looked
pallid
and
clammy
;
his
hair
was
tossed
shaggily
about
his
*NL*
forehead
,
and
his
closed
eyes
had
the
sunken
look
which
follows
upon
*NL*
watching
and
sorrow
.
His
brow
was
knit
,
and
his
whole
face
had
an
*NL*
expression
of
weariness
and
pain
.
Gyp
was
evidently
uneasy
,
for
he
sat
*NL*
on
his
haunches
,
resting
his
nose
on
his
master
's
stretched-out
leg
,
and
*NL*
dividing
the
time
between
licking
the
hand
that
hung
listlessly
down
and
*NL*
glancing
with
a
listening
air
towards
the
door
.
The
poor
dog
was
*NL*
hungry
and
restless
,
but
would
not
leave
his
master
,
and
was
waiting
*NL*
impatiently
for
some
change
in
the
scene
.
It
was
owing
to
this
feeling
*NL*
on
Gyp
's
part
that
,
when
Lisbeth
came
into
the
workshop
and
advanced
*NL*
towards
Adam
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
,
her
intention
not
to
awaken
*NL*
him
was
immediately
defeated
;
for
Gyp
's
excitement
was
too
great
to
find
*NL*
vent
in
anything
short
of
a
sharp
bark
,
and
in
a
moment
Adam
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
and
saw
his
mother
standing
before
him
.
It
was
not
very
unlike
his
*NL*
dream
,
for
his
sleep
had
been
little
more
than
living
through
again
,
in
*NL*
a
fevered
delirious
way
,
all
that
had
happened
since
daybreak
,
and
his
*NL*
mother
with
her
fretful
grief
was
present
to
him
through
it
all
.
The
*NL*
chief
difference
between
the
reality
and
the
vision
was
that
in
*NL*
his
dream
Hetty
was
continually
coming
before
him
in
bodily
*NL*
presence
--
strangely
mingling
herself
as
an
actor
in
scenes
with
which
*NL*
she
had
nothing
to
do
.
She
was
even
by
the
Willow
Brook
;
she
made
his
*NL*
mother
angry
by
coming
into
the
house
;
and
he
met
her
with
her
smart
*NL*
clothes
quite
wet
through
,
as
he
walked
in
the
rain
to
Treddleston
,
to
*NL*
tell
the
coroner
.
But
wherever
Hetty
came
,
his
mother
was
sure
to
follow
*NL*
soon
;
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
,
it
was
not
at
all
startling
to
see
*NL*
her
standing
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
lad
,
my
lad
!
''
Lisbeth
burst
out
immediately
,
her
wailing
impulse
*NL*
returning
,
for
grief
in
its
freshness
feels
the
need
of
associating
its
*NL*
loss
and
its
lament
with
every
change
of
scene
and
incident
,
``
thee
`
st
*NL*
got
nobody
now
but
thy
old
mother
to
torment
thee
and
be
a
burden
to
*NL*
thee
.
Thy
poor
feyther
`
ull
ne'er
anger
thee
no
more
;
an
'
thy
mother
*NL*
may
's
well
go
arter
him
--
the
sooner
the
better
--
for
I
'm
no
good
to
*NL*
nobody
now
.
One
old
coat
`
ull
do
to
patch
another
,
but
it
's
good
for
*NL*
nought
else

Thee

to

a
wife
to
mend
thy
clothes

An

*NL*
a-sittin

i

chimney-corner

-LRB-
Adam
winced
and
moved
uneasily
;
he
*NL*
dreaded
,
of
all
things
,
to
hear
his
mother
speak
of
Hetty
.
-RRB-
But
if
*NL*
thy
feyther
had
lived
,
he
'd
ne'er
ha
'
wanted
me
to
go
to
make
room
for
*NL*
another
,
for
he
could
no
more
ha
'
done
wi'out
me
nor
one
side
o
'
the
*NL*
scissars
can
do
wi'out
th
'
other
.
Eh
,
we
should
ha
'
been
both
flung
away
*NL*
together
,
an
'
then
I
shouldna
ha
'
seen
this
day
,
an
'
one
buryin
'
`
ud
ha

*NL*
done
for
us
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Lisbeth
paused
,
but
Adam
sat
in
pained
silence
--
he
could
not
speak
*NL*
otherwise
than
tenderly
to
his
mother
to-day
,
but
he
could
not
help
*NL*
being
irritated
by
this
plaint
.
It
was
not
possible
for
poor
Lisbeth
to
*NL*
know
how
it
affected
Adam
any
more
than
it
is
possible
for
a
wounded
*NL*
dog
to
know
how
his
moans
affect
the
nerves
of
his
master
.
Like
all
*NL*
complaining
women
,
she
complained
in
the
expectation
of
being
soothed
,
*NL*
and
when
Adam
said
nothing
,
she
was
only
prompted
to
complain
more
*NL*
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
thee
couldst
do
better
wi'out
me
,
for
thee
couldst
go
where
thee
*NL*
likedst
an

marry
them
as
thee
likedst
.
But
I
donna
want
to
say
thee
*NL*
nay
,
let
thee
bring
home
who
thee
wut
;
I
'd
ne'er
open
my
lips
to

for
when

for
I
'm
no

nor
an
*NL*
old

when

blade
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
unable
to
bear
this
any
longer
,
rose
silently
from
the
bench
and
*NL*
walked
out
of
the
workshop
into
the
kitchen
.
But
Lisbeth
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
wutna
go
upstairs
an
'
see
thy
feyther
then
?
I
'n
done
everythin

*NL*
now

an

he
'd
like
thee
to
go
an

look
at
him
,
for
he
war
allays
so
*NL*
pleased
when
thee
wast
mild
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
turned
round
at
once
and
said
,
``
Yes
,
mother
;
let
us
go
upstairs
.
*NL*
Come
,
Seth
,
let
us
go
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
upstairs
,
and
for
five
minutes
all
was
silence
.
Then
the
key
*NL*
was
turned
again
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
But
*NL*
Adam
did
not
come
down
again
;
he
was
too
weary
and
worn-out
to
encounter
*NL*
more
of
his
mother
's
querulous
grief
,
and
he
went
to
rest
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
Lisbeth
no
sooner
entered
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
than
she
threw
her
*NL*
apron
over
her
head
,
and
began
to
cry
and
moan
and
rock
herself
as
*NL*
before
.
Seth
thought
,
``
She
will
be
quieter
by
and
by
,
now
we
have
been
*NL*
upstairs
''
;
and
he
went
into
the
back
kitchen
again
,
to
tend
his
little
*NL*
fire
,
hoping
that
he
should
presently
induce
her
to
have
some
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
had
been
rocking
herself
in
this
way
for
more
than
five
minutes
,
*NL*
giving
a
low
moan
with
every
forward
movement
of
her
body
,
when
she
*NL*
suddenly
felt
a
hand
placed
gently
on
hers
,
and
a
sweet
treble
voice
*NL*
said
to
her
,
``
Dear
sister
,
the
Lord
has
sent
me
to
see
if
I
can
be
a
*NL*
comfort
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
paused
,
in
a
listening
attitude
,
without
removing
her
apron
from
*NL*
her
face
.
The
voice
was
strange
to
her
.
Could
it
be
her
sister
's
spirit
*NL*
come
back
to
her
from
the
dead
after
all
those
years
?
She
trembled
and
*NL*
dared
not
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
,
believing
that
this
pause
of
wonder
was
in
itself
a
relief
for
*NL*
the
sorrowing
woman
,
said
no
more
just
yet
,
but
quietly
took
off
her
*NL*
bonnet
,
and
then
,
motioning
silence
to
Seth
,
who
,
on
hearing
her
voice
,
*NL*
had
come
in
with
a
beating
heart
,
laid
one
hand
on
the
back
of
Lisbeth
's
*NL*
chair
and
leaned
over
her
,
that
she
might
be
aware
of
a
friendly
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
Lisbeth
drew
down
her
apron
,
and
timidly
she
opened
her
dim
*NL*
dark
eyes
.
She
saw
nothing
at
first
but
a
face
--
a
pure
,
pale
face
,
with
*NL*
loving
grey
eyes
,
and
it
was
quite
unknown
to
her
.
Her
wonder
increased
;
*NL*
perhaps
it
WAS
an
angel
.
But
in
the
same
instant
Dinah
had
laid
her
hand
*NL*
on
Lisbeth
's
again
,
and
the
old
woman
looked
down
at
it
.
It
was
a
much
*NL*
smaller
hand
than
her
own
,
but
it
was
not
white
and
delicate
,
for
Dinah
*NL*
had
never
worn
a
glove
in
her
life
,
and
her
hand
bore
the
traces
of
*NL*
labour
from
her
childhood
upwards
.
Lisbeth
looked
earnestly
at
the
hand
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
fixing
her
eyes
again
on
Dinah
's
face
,
said
,
*NL*
with
something
of
restored
courage
,
but
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
``
Why
,
*NL*
ye
're
a
workin
'
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
Dinah
Morris
,
and
I
work
in
the
cotton-mill
when
I
am
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Lisbeth
slowly
,
still
wondering
;

*NL*
Here
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
and
rock
herself
again
;
and
Dinah
said
,
``
Yes
,
*NL*
dear

your

is
great

It
would
be
hardness
of
heart
to

that
your
trouble
was
not
heavy
to
bear
.
God
did
n't
send
me
to
you
*NL*
to
make
light
of
your
sorrow
,
but
to
mourn
with
you
,
if

*NL*
If
you
had
a
table
spread
for
a

making
merry

you
would
think
it
was
kind
to
let
me
come

sit
down
and
*NL*
rejoice
with
you
,
because
you
'd
think
I
should
like
to
share
those
*NL*
good
things
;
but
I
should
like
better
to
share
in
your
trouble
and
your
*NL*
labour
,
and
it
would
seem
harder
to
me
if
you
denied
me
that
.
You
wo

me
away

You

not

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
took
care
not
to
betray
that
she
had
had
her
tea
,
and
accepted
*NL*
Lisbeth
's
invitation
very
readily
,
for
the
sake
of
persuading
the
old
*NL*
woman
herself
to
take
the
food
and
drink
she
so
much
needed
after
a
day
*NL*
of
hard
work
and
fasting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
so
happy
now
Dinah
was
in
the
house
that
he
could
not
help
*NL*
thinking
her
presence
was
worth
purchasing
with
a
life
in
which
grief
*NL*
incessantly
followed
upon
grief
;
but
the
next
moment
he
reproached
*NL*
himself
--
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
rejoicing
in
his
father
's
sad
*NL*
death
.
Nevertheless
the
joy
of
being
with
Dinah
WOULD
triumph
--
it
was
*NL*
like
the
influence
of
climate
,
which
no
resistance
can
overcome
.
And
the
*NL*
feeling
even
suffused
itself
over
his
face
so
as
to
attract
his
mother
's
*NL*
notice
,
while
she
was
drinking
her
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

here
Lisbeth

turned
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dinah
,
careful
not
to
oppose
any
feeling
of
Lisbeth
's
,
for
*NL*
her
reliance
,
in
her
smallest
words
and
deeds
,
on
a
divine
guidance
,
*NL*
always
issued
in
that
finest
woman
's
tact
which
proceeds
from
acute
and
*NL*
ready
sympathy
;
``
yes
,
I
remember
too
,
when
my
dear
aunt
died
,
I
longed
*NL*
for
the
sound
of
her
bad
cough
in
the
nights

instead
of
the
silence
*NL*
that
came
when
she
was
gone

But

drink
this
other
cup
*NL*
of
tea

eat
a
little
more

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Lisbeth
,
taking
the
cup
and
speaking
in
a
less
querulous
*NL*
tone
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

never

my

brought
me
up
from
a

*NL*
She
had
no
children
,
for
she
was
never
married

she
brought
me
up
as
*NL*
tenderly
as
if
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

But
what
did

do
when
your

died
,
an
'
why
didna

*NL*
this
country

bein

as
Mrs.
Poyser
's
your

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
,
seeing
that
Lisbeth
's
attention
was
attracted
,
told
her
the
story
*NL*
of
her
early
life
--
how
she
had
been
brought
up
to
work
hard
,
and
*NL*
what
sort
of
place
Snowfield
was
,
and
how
many
people
had
a
hard
life
*NL*
there
--
all
the
details
that
she
thought
likely
to
interest
Lisbeth
.
The
*NL*
old
woman
listened
,
and
forgot
to
be
fretful
,
unconsciously
subject
to
*NL*
the
soothing
influence
of
Dinah
's
face
and
voice
.
After
a
while
she
was
*NL*
persuaded
to
let
the
kitchen
be
made
tidy
;
for
Dinah
was
bent
on
this
,
*NL*
believing
that
the
sense
of
order
and
quietude
around
her
would
help
in
*NL*
disposing
Lisbeth
to
join
in
the
prayer
she
longed
to
pour
forth
at
her
*NL*
side
.
Seth
,
meanwhile
,
went
out
to
chop
wood
,
for
he
surmised
that
Dinah
*NL*
would
like
to
be
left
alone
with
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
sat
watching
her
as
she
moved
about
in
her
still
quick
way
,
and
*NL*
said
at
last
,
``
Ye
've
got
a
notion
o

cleanin

up

I
wouldna

*NL*
``
They

a

While

Eh
,
I
*NL*
like
them
words
--

I
shall
go
to
him
,
but
he
wonna
come
back
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
and
Seth
were
both
inwardly
offering
thanks
for
the
greater
*NL*
quietness
of
spirit
that
had
come
over
Lisbeth
.
This
was
what
Dinah
had
*NL*
been
trying
to
bring
about
,
through
all
her
still
sympathy
and
absence
*NL*
from
exhortation
.
From
her
girlhood
upwards
she
had
had
experience
among
*NL*
the
sick
and
the
mourning
,
among
minds
hardened
and
shrivelled
through
*NL*
poverty
and
ignorance
,
and
had
gained
the
subtlest
perception
of
the
*NL*
mode
in
which
they
could
best
be
touched
and
softened
into
willingness
*NL*
to
receive
words
of
spiritual
consolation
or
warning
.
As
Dinah
expressed
*NL*
it
,
``
she
was
never
left
to
herself
;
but
it
was
always
given
her
when
to
*NL*
keep
silence
and
when
to
speak
.
''
And
do
we
not
all
agree
to
call
rapid
*NL*
thought
and
noble
impulse
by
the
name
of
inspiration
?
After
our
subtlest
*NL*
analysis
of
the
mental
process
,
we
must
still
say
,
as
Dinah
did
,
that
*NL*
our
highest
thoughts
and
our
best
deeds
are
all
given
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
there
was
earnest
prayer
--
there
was
faith
,
love
,
and
hope
pouring
*NL*
forth
that
evening
in
the
little
kitchen
.
And
poor
,
aged
,
fretful
*NL*
Lisbeth
,
without
grasping
any
distinct
idea
,
without
going
through
any
*NL*
course
of
religious
emotions
,
felt
a
vague
sense
of
goodness
and
love
,
*NL*
and
of
something
right
lying
underneath
and
beyond
all
this
sorrowing
*NL*
life
.
She
could
n't
understand
the
sorrow
;
but
,
for
these
moments
,
under
*NL*
the
subduing
influence
of
Dinah
's
spirit
,
she
felt
that
she
must
be
*NL*
patient
and
still
.

Chapter
XI
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Cottage
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
but
half-past
four
the
next
morning
when
Dinah
,
tired
of
lying
*NL*
awake
listening
to
the
birds
and
watching
the
growing
light
through
the
*NL*
little
window
in
the
garret
roof
,
rose
and
began
to
dress
herself
very
*NL*
quietly
,
lest
she
should
disturb
Lisbeth
.
But
already
some
one
else
was
*NL*
astir
in
the
house
,
and
had
gone
downstairs
,
preceded
by
Gyp
.
The
dog
's
*NL*
pattering
step
was
a
sure
sign
that
it
was
Adam
who
went
down
;
but
Dinah
*NL*
was
not
aware
of
this
,
and
she
thought
it
was
more
likely
to
be
Seth
,
*NL*
for
he
had
told
her
how
Adam
had
stayed
up
working
the
night
before
.
*NL*
Seth
,
however
,
had
only
just
awakened
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
*NL*
door
.
The
exciting
influence
of
the
previous
day
,
heightened
at
last
*NL*
by
Dinah
's
unexpected
presence
,
had
not
been
counteracted
by
any
bodily
*NL*
weariness
,
for
he
had
not
done
his
ordinary
amount
of
hard
work
;
and
so
*NL*
when
he
went
to
bed
;
it
was
not
till
he
had
tired
himself
with
hours
of
*NL*
tossing
wakefulness
that
drowsiness
came
,
and
led
on
a
heavier
morning
*NL*
sleep
than
was
usual
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Adam
had
been
refreshed
by
his
long
rest
,
and
with
his
habitual
*NL*
impatience
of
mere
passivity
,
he
was
eager
to
begin
the
new
day
and
*NL*
subdue
sadness
by
his
strong
will
and
strong
arm
.
The
white
mist
lay
in
*NL*
the
valley
;
it
was
going
to
be
a
bright
warm
day
,
and
he
would
start
to
*NL*
work
again
when
he
had
had
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
but
what
's
bearable
as
long
as
a
man
can
work
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
;
``
the
natur
o
'
things
does
n't
change
,
though
it
seems
as
if
*NL*
one
's
own
life
was
nothing
but
change
.
The
square
o
'
four
is
sixteen
,
*NL*
and
you
must
lengthen
your
lever
in
proportion
to
your
weight
,
is
as
*NL*
true
when
a
man
's
miserable
as
when
he
's
happy
;
and
the
best
o
'
working
*NL*
is
,
it
gives
you
a
grip
hold
o
'
things
outside
your
own
lot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
dashed
the
cold
water
over
his
head
and
face
,
he
felt
completely
*NL*
himself
again
,
and
with
his
black
eyes
as
keen
as
ever
and
his
thick
*NL*
black
hair
all
glistening
with
the
fresh
moisture
,
he
went
into
the
*NL*
workshop
to
look
out
the
wood
for
his
father
's
coffin
,
intending
that
*NL*
he
and
Seth
should
carry
it
with
them
to
Jonathan
Burge
's
and
have
the
*NL*
coffin
made
by
one
of
the
workmen
there
,
so
that
his
mother
might
not
*NL*
see
and
hear
the
sad
task
going
forward
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
gone
into
the
workshop
when
his
quick
ear
detected
a
light
*NL*
rapid
foot
on
the
stairs
--
certainly
not
his
mother
's
.
He
had
been
in
bed
*NL*
and
asleep
when
Dinah
had
come
in
,
in
the
evening
,
and
now
he
wondered
*NL*
whose
step
this
could
be
.
A
foolish
thought
came
,
and
moved
him
*NL*
strangely
.
As
if
it
could
be
Hetty
!
She
was
the
last
person
likely
to
*NL*
be
in
the
house
.
And
yet
he
felt
reluctant
to
go
and
look
and
have
the
*NL*
clear
proof
that
it
was
some
one
else
.
He
stood
leaning
on
a
plank
he
*NL*
had
taken
hold
of
,
listening
to
sounds
which
his
imagination
interpreted
*NL*
for
him
so
pleasantly
that
the
keen
strong
face
became
suffused
with
a
*NL*
timid
tenderness
.
The
light
footstep
moved
about
the
kitchen
,
followed
*NL*
by
the
sound
of
the
sweeping
brush
,
hardly
making
so
much
noise
as
the
*NL*
lightest
breeze
that
chases
the
autumn
leaves
along
the
dusty
path
;
and
*NL*
Adam
's
imagination
saw
a
dimpled
face
,
with
dark
bright
eyes
and
roguish
*NL*
smiles
looking
backward
at
this
brush
,
and
a
rounded
figure
just
leaning
*NL*
a
little
to
clasp
the
handle
.
A
very
foolish
thought
--
it
could
not
be
*NL*
Hetty
;
but
the
only
way
of
dismissing
such
nonsense
from
his
head
was
*NL*
to
go
and
see
WHO
it
was
,
for
his
fancy
only
got
nearer
and
nearer
to
*NL*
belief
while
he
stood
there
listening
.
He
loosed
the
plank
and
went
to
*NL*
the
kitchen
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Adam
Bede
?
''
said
Dinah
,
in
her
calm
treble
,
pausing
from
*NL*
her
sweeping
and
fixing
her
mild
grave
eyes
upon
him
.
``
I
trust
you
feel
*NL*
rested
and
strengthened
again
to
bear
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
dreaming
of
the
sunshine
and
awaking
in
the
moonlight
.
Adam
*NL*
had
seen
Dinah
several
times
,
but
always
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
where
he
was
*NL*
not
very
vividly
conscious
of
any
woman
's
presence
except
Hetty
's
,
and
*NL*
he
had
only
in
the
last
day
or
two
begun
to
suspect
that
Seth
was
in
*NL*
love
with
her
,
so
that
his
attention
had
not
hitherto
been
drawn
towards
*NL*
her
for
his
brother
's
sake
.
But
now
her
slim
figure
,
her
plain
black
*NL*
gown
,
and
her
pale
serene
face
impressed
him
with
all
the
force
that
*NL*
belongs
to
a
reality
contrasted
with
a
preoccupying
fancy
.
For
the
*NL*
first
moment
or
two
he
made
no
answer
,
but
looked
at
her
with
the
*NL*
concentrated
,
examining
glance
which
a
man
gives
to
an
object
in
which
*NL*
he
has
suddenly
begun
to
be
interested
.
Dinah
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
*NL*
life
,
felt
a
painful
self-consciousness
;
there
was
something
in
the
dark
*NL*
penetrating
glance
of
this
strong
man
so
different
from
the
mildness
and
*NL*
timidity
of
his
brother
Seth
.
A
faint
blush
came
,
which
deepened
as
she
*NL*
wondered
at
it
.
This
blush
recalled
Adam
from
his
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
quite
taken
by
surprise
;
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
*NL*
my
mother
in
her
trouble
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
gentle
grateful
tone
,
for
his
*NL*
quick
mind
told
him
at
once
how
she
came
to
be
there
.
``
I
hope
my
mother
*NL*
was
thankful
to
have
you
,
''
he
added
,
wondering
rather
anxiously
what
had
*NL*
been
Dinah
's
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dinah
,
resuming
her
work
,
``
she
seemed
greatly
comforted
*NL*
after
a
while
,
and
she
's
had
a
good
deal
of
rest
in
the
night
,
by
times
.
*NL*
She
was
fast
asleep
when
I
left
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
took
the
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
?
''
said
Adam
,
his
thoughts
*NL*
reverting
to
some
one
there
;
he
wondered
whether
SHE
had
felt
anything
*NL*
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Mr.
Irwine
,
the
clergyman
,
told
me
,
and
my
aunt
was
grieved
*NL*
for
your
mother
when
she
heard
it
,
and
wanted
me
to
come
;
and
so
is
my
*NL*
uncle
,
I
'm
sure
,
now
he
's
heard
it
,
but
he
was
gone
out
to
Rosseter
all
*NL*
yesterday
.
They
'll
look
for
you
there
as
soon
as
you
've
got
time
to
go
,
*NL*
for
there
's
nobody
round
that
hearth
but
what
's
glad
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
,
with
her
sympathetic
divination
,
knew
quite
well
that
Adam
was
*NL*
longing
to
hear
if
Hetty
had
said
anything
about
their
trouble
;
she
was
*NL*
too
rigorously
truthful
for
benevolent
invention
,
but
she
had
contrived
*NL*
to
say
something
in
which
Hetty
was
tacitly
included
.
Love
has
a
way
*NL*
of
cheating
itself
consciously
,
like
a
child
who
plays
at
solitary
*NL*
hide-and-seek
;
it
is
pleased
with
assurances
that
it
all
the
while
*NL*
disbelieves
.
Adam
liked
what
Dinah
had
said
so
much
that
his
mind
was
*NL*
directly
full
of
the
next
visit
he
should
pay
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
when
*NL*
Hetty
would
perhaps
behave
more
kindly
to
him
than
she
had
ever
done
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
wo
n't
be
there
yourself
any
longer
?
''
he
said
to
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
go
back
to
Snowfield
on
Saturday
,
and
I
shall
have
to
set
out
to
*NL*
Treddleston
early
,
to
be
in
time
for
the
Oakbourne
carrier
.
So
I
must
go
*NL*
back
to
the
farm
to-night
,
that
I
may
have
the
last
day
with
my
aunt
and
*NL*
her
children
.
But
I
can
stay
here
all
to-day
,
if
your
mother
would
like
*NL*
me
;
and
her
heart
seemed
inclined
towards
me
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
she
's
sure
to
want
you
to-day
.
If
mother
takes
to
people
at
*NL*
the
beginning
,
she
's
sure
to
get
fond
of
'em
;
but
she
's
a
strange
way
of
*NL*
not
liking
young
women
.
Though
,
to
be
sure
,
''
Adam
went
on
,
smiling
,
``
her
*NL*
not
liking
other
young
women
is
no
reason
why
she
should
n't
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hitherto
Gyp
had
been
assisting
at
this
conversation
in
motionless
*NL*
silence
,
seated
on
his
haunches
,
and
alternately
looking
up
in
his
*NL*
master
's
face
to
watch
its
expression
and
observing
Dinah
's
movements
*NL*
about
the
kitchen
.
The
kind
smile
with
which
Adam
uttered
the
last
words
*NL*
was
apparently
decisive
with
Gyp
of
the
light
in
which
the
stranger
*NL*
was
to
be
regarded
,
and
as
she
turned
round
after
putting
aside
her
*NL*
sweeping-brush
,
he
trotted
towards
her
and
put
up
his
muzzle
against
her
*NL*
hand
in
a
friendly
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
Gyp
bids
you
welcome
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
and
he
's
very
slow
to
*NL*
welcome
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dog
!
''
said
Dinah
,
patting
the
rough
grey
coat
,
``
I
've
a
strange
*NL*
feeling
about
the
dumb
things
as
if
they
wanted
to
speak
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
trouble
to
'em
because
they
could
n't
.
I
ca
n't
help
being
sorry
for
the
*NL*
dogs
always
,
though
perhaps
there
's
no
need
.
But
they
may
well
have
more
*NL*
in
them
than
they
know
how
to
make
us
understand
,
for
we
ca
n't
say
half
*NL*
what
we
feel
,
with
all
our
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
came
down
now
,
and
was
pleased
to
find
Adam
talking
with
Dinah
;
he
*NL*
wanted
Adam
to
know
how
much
better
she
was
than
all
other
women
.
*NL*
But
after
a
few
words
of
greeting
,
Adam
drew
him
into
the
workshop
to
*NL*
consult
about
the
coffin
,
and
Dinah
went
on
with
her
cleaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
six
o'clock
they
were
all
at
breakfast
with
Lisbeth
in
a
kitchen
as
*NL*
clean
as
she
could
have
made
it
herself
.
The
window
and
door
were
open
,
*NL*
and
the
morning
air
brought
with
it
a
mingled
scent
of
southernwood
,
*NL*
thyme
,
and
sweet-briar
from
the
patch
of
garden
by
the
side
of
the
*NL*
cottage
.
Dinah
did
not
sit
down
at
first
,
but
moved
about
,
serving
the
*NL*
others
with
the
warm
porridge
and
the
toasted
oat-cake
,
which
she
had
*NL*
got
ready
in
the
usual
way
,
for
she
had
asked
Seth
to
tell
her
just
what
*NL*
his
mother
gave
them
for
breakfast
.
Lisbeth
had
been
unusually
silent
*NL*
since
she
came
downstairs
,
apparently
requiring
some
time
to
adjust
her
*NL*
ideas
to
a
state
of
things
in
which
she
came
down
like
a
lady
to
find
*NL*
all
the
work
done
,
and
sat
still
to
be
waited
on
.
Her
new
sensations
*NL*
seemed
to
exclude
the
remembrance
of
her
grief
.
At
last
,
after
tasting
*NL*
the
porridge
,
she
broke
silence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
might
ha
'
made
the
parridge
worse
,
''
she
said
to
Dinah
;
``
I
can
ate
it
*NL*
wi'out
its
turnin
'
my
stomach
.
It
might
ha
'
been
a
trifle
thicker
an
'
no
*NL*
harm
,

*NL*
I

Bartle
Massey
says
--
and
he
knows
the
South

as
*NL*
the
northern
men
are
a
finer
breed
than
the
southern

harder-headed

*NL*
stronger-bodied
,
and
a

taller

then
he
says
in
some
o

those

counties
it
's
as
flat
as
the

your

,
and
you
can
see
nothing
*NL*
of
a
distance
without
climbing
up
the
highest
trees
.
I
could
n't
abide
*NL*
that

I
like
to
go
to
work
by
a
road

'll
take
me
up
a
bit

*NL*

see
the
fields

miles
round
me

a
bridge

a

a
bit
*NL*
of
a

here

there

It
makes
you
feel
the

a
big
place

there
's
other

working

often

the

very

rather
wistfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no

,

no

said
Seth
,
gently
,
though
his
voice
*NL*
told
that
he
spoke
with
some
effort
;
``
Mother

in
the
right

I
'll
go

work

do

*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
into
the
workshop
immediately
,
followed
by
Adam
;
while
*NL*
Lisbeth
,
automatically
obeying
her
old
habits
,
began
to
put
away
the
*NL*
breakfast
things
,
as
if
she
did
not
mean
Dinah
to
take
her
place
any
*NL*
longer
.
Dinah
said
nothing
,
but
presently
used
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
quietly
joining
the
brothers
in
the
workshop
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
already
got
on
their
aprons
and
paper
caps
,
and
Adam
was
*NL*
standing
with
his
left
hand
on
Seth
's
shoulder
,
while
he
pointed
with
*NL*
the
hammer
in
his
right
to
some
boards
which
they
were
looking
at
.
Their
*NL*
backs
were
turned
towards
the
door
by
which
Dinah
entered
,
and
she
came
*NL*
in
so
gently
that
they
were
not
aware
of
her
presence
till
they
heard
*NL*
her
voice
saying
,
``
Seth
Bede
!
''
Seth
started
,
and
they
both
turned
round
.
*NL*
Dinah
looked
as
if
she
did
not
see
Adam
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
Seth
's
*NL*
face
,
saying
with
calm
kindness
,
``
I
wo
n't
say
farewell
.
I
shall
see
you
*NL*
again
when
you
come
from

So
as
I

at
the
farm
before
dark
,
it

will
be
quite
soon
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank

Dinah

home
with

once
more
.
It
'll
*NL*
perhaps
be
the
last
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
tremor
in
Seth
's
voice
.
Dinah
put
out
her
hand
and
*NL*
said
,
``
You
'll
have
sweet
peace
in
your
mind
to-day

Seth
,
for
your
*NL*
tenderness
and
long-suffering

your
aged
mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
round
and
left
the
workshop
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
she
had
*NL*
entered
it
.
Adam
had
been
observing
her
closely
all
the
while
,
but
she
*NL*
had
not
looked
at
him
.
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
he
said
,
``
I
do
n't
wonder
*NL*
at
thee
for
loving
her
,
Seth
.
She
's
got
a
face
like
a
lily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
's
soul
rushed
to
his
eyes
and
lips
:
he
had
never
yet
confessed
his
*NL*
secret
to
Adam
,
but
now
he
felt
a
delicious
sense
of
disburdenment
,
*NL*
as
he
answered
,
``
Aye
,
Addy
,
I
do
love
her
--
too
much
,
I
doubt
.
But
she
*NL*
doesna
love
me
,
lad
,
only
as
one
child
o
'
God
loves
another
.
She
'll
*NL*
never
love
any
man
as
a
husband
--
that
's
my
belief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
lad
,
there
's
no
telling
;
thee
mustna
lose
heart

She
's
made
out
*NL*
o

stuff
with
a
finer
grain
than
most
o
'
the
women
;
I
can
see
that
clear
*NL*
enough
.
But
if
she
's
better
than
they
are
in
other
things
,
I
canna
think
*NL*
she
'll
fall
short
of
'em
in
loving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
was
said
.
Seth
set
out
to
the
village
,
and
Adam
began
his
work
*NL*
on
the
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
help
the
lad
,
and
me
too
,
''
he
thought
,
as
he
lifted
the
board
.
*NL*
``
We
're
like
enough
to
find
life
a
tough
job
--
hard
work
inside
and
out
.
*NL*
It
's
a
strange
thing
to
think
of
a
man
as
can
lift
a
chair
with
his
*NL*
teeth
and
walk
fifty
mile
on
end
,
trembling
and
turning
hot
and
cold
*NL*
at
only
a
look
from
one
woman
out
of
all
the
rest
i

the
world
.
It
's
a
*NL*
mystery
we
can
give
no
account
of
;
but
no
more
we
can
of
the
sprouting

the
seed

THAT

Thursday

Arthur
Donnithorne

moving
about
in

dressing-room
seeing
his
well-looking
British
person
reflected
in

old-fashioned

stared
at
,
from
a
dingy
olive-green
piece
*NL*
of
tapestry
,
by
Pharaoh
's
daughter
and
her
maidens
,
who
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
minding

he
was
holding
a

which
,
by
the
time
his

tying

in

``

The
low
whistle

had
assisted

in
arriving
at

here
broke
out
into

an
heroic
strain
;
*NL*
nevertheless
Arthur
felt
himself
very
heroic
as
he
strode
towards
the
*NL*
stables
to
give
his
orders
about
the
horses
.
His
own
approbation
was
*NL*
necessary
to
him
,
and
it
was
not
an
approbation
to
be
enjoyed
quite
*NL*
gratuitously
;
it
must
be
won
by
a
fair
amount
of
merit
.
He
had
never
yet
*NL*
forfeited
that
approbation
,
and
he
had
considerable
reliance
on
his
own
*NL*
virtues
.
No
young
man
could
confess
his
faults
more
candidly
;
candour
*NL*
was
one
of
his
favourite
virtues
;
and
how
can
a
man
's
candour
be
seen
*NL*
in
all
its
lustre
unless
he
has
a
few
failings
to
talk
of
?
But
he
had
*NL*
an
agreeable
confidence
that
his
faults
were
all
of
a
generous
*NL*
kind
--
impetuous
,
warm-blooded
,
leonine
;
never
crawling
,
crafty
,
*NL*
reptilian
.
It
was
not
possible
for
Arthur
Donnithorne
to
do
anything
*NL*
mean
,
dastardly
,
or
cruel
.
``
No
!
I
'm
a
devil
of
a
fellow
for
getting
*NL*
myself
into
a
hobble
,
but
I
always
take
care
the
load
shall
fall
on
*NL*
my
own
shoulders
.
''
Unhappily
,
there
is
no
inherent
poetical
justice
in
*NL*
hobbles
,
and
they
will
sometimes
obstinately
refuse
to
inflict
their
*NL*
worst
consequences
on
the
prime
offender
,
in
spite
of
his
loudly
*NL*
expressed
wish
.
It
was
entirely
owing
to
this
deficiency
in
the
scheme
*NL*
of
things
that
Arthur
had
ever
brought
any
one
into
trouble
besides
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
nothing
if
not
good-natured
;
and
all
his
pictures
of
*NL*
the
future
,
when
he
should
come
into
the
estate
,
were
made
up
of
a
*NL*
prosperous
,
contented
tenantry
,
adoring
their
landlord
,
who
would
be
the
*NL*
model
of
an
English
gentleman
--
mansion
in
first-rate
order
,
all
elegance
*NL*
and
high
taste
--
jolly
housekeeping
,
finest
stud
in
Loamshire
--
purse
open
*NL*
to
all
public
objects
--
in
short
,
everything
as
different
as
possible
*NL*
from
what
was
now
associated
with
the
name
of
Donnithorne
.
And
one
of
*NL*
the
first
good
actions
he
would
perform
in
that
future
should
be
to
*NL*
increase
Irwine
's
income
for
the
vicarage
of
Hayslope
,
so
that
he
might
*NL*
keep
a
carriage
for
his
mother
and
sisters
.
His
hearty
affection
for
the
*NL*
rector
dated
from
the
age
of
frocks
and
trousers
.
It
was
an
affection
*NL*
partly
filial
,
partly
fraternal
--
fraternal
enough
to
make
him
like
*NL*
Irwine
's
company
better
than
that
of
most
younger
men
,
and
filial
enough
*NL*
to
make
him
shrink
strongly
from
incurring
Irwine
's
disapprobation
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
perceive
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
was
``
a
good
fellow
''
--
all
his
*NL*
college
friends
thought
him
such
.
He
could
n't
bear
to
see
any
one
*NL*
uncomfortable
;
he
would
have
been
sorry
even
in
his
angriest
moods
for
*NL*
any
harm
to
happen
to
his
grandfather
;
and
his
Aunt
Lydia
herself
had
*NL*
the
benefit
of
that
soft-heartedness
which
he
bore
towards
the
whole
*NL*
sex
.
Whether
he
would
have
self-mastery
enough
to
be
always
as
harmless
*NL*
and
purely
beneficent
as
his
good-nature
led
him
to
desire
,
was
a
*NL*
question
that
no
one
had
yet
decided
against
him
;
he
was
but
twenty-one
,
*NL*
you
remember
,
and
we
do
n't
inquire
too
closely
into
character
in
the
*NL*
case
of
a
handsome
generous
young
fellow
,
who
will
have
property
enough
*NL*
to
support
numerous
peccadilloes
--
who
,
if
he
should
unfortunately
*NL*
break
a
man
's
legs
in
his
rash
driving
,
will
be
able
to
pension
him
*NL*
handsomely
;
or
if
he
should
happen
to
spoil
a
woman
's
existence
for
her
,
*NL*
will
make
it
up
to
her
with
expensive
bon-bons
,
packed
up
and
directed
*NL*
by
his
own
hand
.
It
would
be
ridiculous
to
be
prying
and
analytic
*NL*
in
such
cases
,
as
if
one
were
inquiring
into
the
character
of
a
*NL*
confidential
clerk
.
We
use
round
,
general
,
gentlemanly
epithets
about
*NL*
a
young
man
of
birth
and
fortune
;
and
ladies
,
with
that
fine
intuition
*NL*
which
is
the
distinguishing
attribute
of
their
sex
,
see
at
once
that
*NL*
he
is
``
nice
.
''
The
chances
are
that
he
will
go
through
life
without
*NL*
scandalizing
any
one
;
a
seaworthy
vessel
that
no
one
would
refuse
to
*NL*
insure
.
Ships
,
certainly
,
are
liable
to
casualties
,
which
sometimes
make
*NL*
terribly
evident
some
flaw
in
their
construction
that
would
never
have
*NL*
been
discoverable
in
smooth
water
;
and
many
a
``
good
fellow
,
''
through
a
*NL*
disastrous
combination
of
circumstances
,
has
undergone
a
like
betrayal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
have
no
fair
ground
for
entertaining
unfavourable
auguries
*NL*
concerning
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
who
this
morning
proves
himself
capable
*NL*
of
a
prudent
resolution
founded
on
conscience
.
One
thing
is
clear
:
*NL*
Nature
has
taken
care
that
he
shall
never
go
far
astray
with
perfect
*NL*
comfort
and
satisfaction
to
himself
;
he
will
never
get
beyond
that
*NL*
border-land
of
sin
,
where
he
will
be
perpetually
harassed
by
assaults
*NL*
from
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
.
He
will
never
be
a
courtier
of
*NL*
Vice
,
and
wear
her
orders
in
his
button-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
;
*NL*
everything
was
looking
lovelier
for
the
yesterday
's
rain
.
It
is
a
*NL*
pleasant
thing
on
such
a
morning
to
walk
along
the
well-rolled
gravel
on
*NL*
one
's
way
to
the
stables
,
meditating
an
excursion
.
But
the
scent
of
*NL*
the
stables
,
which
,
in
a
natural
state
of
things
,
ought
to
be
among
*NL*
the
soothing
influences
of
a
man
's
life
,
always
brought
with
it
some
*NL*
irritation
to
Arthur
.
There
was
no
having
his
own
way
in
the
stables
;
*NL*
everything
was
managed
in
the
stingiest
fashion
.
His
grandfather
*NL*
persisted
in
retaining
as
head
groom
an
old
dolt
whom
no
sort
of
*NL*
lever
could
move
out
of
his
old
habits
,
and
who
was
allowed
to
hire
a
*NL*
succession
of
raw
Loamshire
lads
as
his
subordinates
,
one
of
whom
*NL*
had
lately
tested
a
new
pair
of
shears
by
clipping
an
oblong
patch
on
*NL*
Arthur
's
bay
mare
.
This
state
of
things
is
naturally
embittering
;
one
*NL*
can
put
up
with
annoyances
in
the
house
,
but
to
have
the
stable
made
*NL*
a
scene
of
vexation
and
disgust
is
a
point
beyond
what
human
flesh
*NL*
and
blood
can
be
expected
to
endure
long
together
without
danger
of
*NL*
misanthropy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
John
's
wooden
,
deep-wrinkled
face
was
the
first
object
that
met
*NL*
Arthur
's
eyes
as
he
entered
the
stable-yard
,
and
it
quite
poisoned
for
*NL*
him
the
bark
of
the
two
bloodhounds
that
kept
watch
there
.
He
could
*NL*
never
speak
quite
patiently
to
the
old
blockhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
Meg
saddled
for
me
and
brought
to
the
door
at
half-past
*NL*
eleven
,
and
I
shall
want
Rattler
saddled
for
Pym
at
the
same
time
.
Do
*NL*
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
hear
,
I
hear
,
Cap'n
,
''
said
old
John
very
deliberately
,
following
*NL*
the
young
master
into
the
stable
.
John
considered
a
young
master
as
the
*NL*
natural
enemy
of
an
old
servant
,
and
young
people
in
general
as
a
poor
*NL*
contrivance
for
carrying
on
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
went
in
for
the
sake
of
patting
Meg
,
declining
as
far
as
possible
*NL*
to
see
anything
in
the
stables
,
lest
he
should
lose
his
temper
before
*NL*
breakfast
.
The
pretty
creature
was
in
one
of
the
inner
stables
,
and
*NL*
turned
her
mild
head
as
her
master
came
beside
her
.
Little
Trot
,
a
tiny
*NL*
spaniel
,
her
inseparable
companion
in
the
stable
,
was
comfortably
curled
*NL*
up
on
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Meg
,
my
pretty
girl
,
''
said
Arthur
,
patting
her
neck
,
``
we
'll
have
*NL*
a
glorious
canter
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
your
honour
,
I
donna
see
as
that
can
be
,
''
said
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
be
?
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
's
got
lamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lamed
,
confound
you
!
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
th
'
lad
took
her
too
close
to
Dalton
's
hosses
,
an
'
one
on
'em
*NL*
flung
out
at
her
,
an
'
she
's
got
her
shank
bruised
o
'
the
near
foreleg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
judicious
historian
abstains
from
narrating
precisely
what
ensued
.
*NL*
You
understand
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
strong
language
,
mingled
*NL*
with
soothing
``
who-ho
's
''
while
the
leg
was
examined
;
that
John
stood
*NL*
by
with
quite
as
much
emotion
as
if
he
had
been
a
cunningly
carved
*NL*
crab-tree
walking-stick
,
and
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
presently
repassed
*NL*
the
iron
gates
of
the
pleasure-ground
without
singing
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
considered
himself
thoroughly
disappointed
and
annoyed
.
There
was
not
*NL*
another
mount
in
the
stable
for
himself
and
his
servant
besides
Meg
and
*NL*
Rattler
.
It
was
vexatious
;
just
when
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
way
*NL*
for
a
week
or
two
.
It
seemed
culpable
in
Providence
to
allow
such
a
*NL*
combination
of
circumstances
.
To
be
shut
up
at
the
Chase
with
a
broken
*NL*
arm
when
every
other
fellow
in
his
regiment
was
enjoying
himself
*NL*
at
Windsor
--
shut
up
with
his
grandfather
,
who
had
the
same
sort
of
*NL*
affection
for
him
as
for
his
parchment
deeds
!
And
to
be
disgusted
at
*NL*
every
turn
with
the
management
of
the
house
and
the
estate
!
In
such
*NL*
circumstances
a
man
necessarily
gets
in
an
ill
humour
,
and
works
off
the
*NL*
irritation
by
some
excess
or
other
.
``
Salkeld
would
have
drunk
a
bottle
*NL*
of
port
every
day
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
,
``
but
I
'm
not
well
seasoned
*NL*
enough
for
that
.
Well
,
since
I
ca
n't
go
to
Eagledale
,
I
'll
have
a
gallop
*NL*
on
Rattler
to
Norburne
this
morning
,
and
lunch
with
Gawaine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
this
explicit
resolution
there
lay
an
implicit
one
.
If
he
lunched
*NL*
with
Gawaine
and
lingered
chatting
,
he
should
not
reach
the
Chase
again
*NL*
till
nearly
five
,
when
Hetty
would
be
safe
out
of
his
sight
in
the
*NL*
housekeeper
's
room
;
and
when
she
set
out
to
go
home
,
it
would
be
his
*NL*
lazy
time
after
dinner
,
so
he
should
keep
out
of
her
way
altogether
.
*NL*
There
really
would
have
been
no
harm
in
being
kind
to
the
little
thing
,
*NL*
and
it
was
worth
dancing
with
a
dozen
ballroom
belles
only
to
look
at
*NL*
Hetty
for
half
an
hour
.
But
perhaps
he
had
better
not
take
any
more
*NL*
notice
of
her
;
it
might
put
notions
into
her
head
,
as
Irwine
had
hinted
;
*NL*
though
Arthur
,
for
his
part
,
thought
girls
were
not
by
any
means
so
soft
*NL*
and
easily
bruised
;
indeed
,
he
had
generally
found
them
twice
as
cool
*NL*
and
cunning
as
he
was
himself
.
As
for
any
real
harm
in
Hetty
's
case
,
it
*NL*
was
out
of
the
question
:
Arthur
Donnithorne
accepted
his
own
bond
for
*NL*
himself
with
perfect
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
twelve
o'clock
sun
saw
him
galloping
towards
Norburne
;
and
by
*NL*
good
fortune
Halsell
Common
lay
in
his
road
and
gave
him
some
fine
*NL*
leaps
for
Rattler
.
Nothing
like
``
taking
''
a
few
bushes
and
ditches
for
*NL*
exorcising
a
demon
;
and
it
is
really
astonishing
that
the
Centaurs
,
with
*NL*
their
immense
advantages
in
this
way
,
have
left
so
bad
a
reputation
in
*NL*
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
hear
that
although
Gawaine
*NL*
was
at
home
,
the
hand
of
the
dial
in
the
courtyard
had
scarcely
*NL*
cleared
the
last
stroke
of
three
when
Arthur
returned
through
the
*NL*
entrance-gates
,
got
down
from
the
panting
Rattler
,
and
went
into
the
*NL*
house
to
take
a
hasty
luncheon
.
But
I
believe
there
have
been
men
*NL*
since
his
day
who
have
ridden
a
long
way
to
avoid
a
rencontre
,
and
then
*NL*
galloped
hastily
back
lest
they
should
miss
it
.
It
is
the
favourite
*NL*
stratagem
of
our
passions
to
sham
a
retreat
,
and
to
turn
sharp
round
*NL*
upon
us
at
the
moment
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
the
day
is
our
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cap'n
's
been
ridin
'
the
devil
's
own
pace
,
''
said
Dalton
the
*NL*
coachman
,
whose
person
stood
out
in
high
relief
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
*NL*
against
the
stable
wall
,
when
John
brought
up
Rattler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
I
wish
he
'd
get
the
devil
to
do
's
grooming
for
`
n
,
''
growled
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
;
he
'd
hev
a
deal
haimabler
groom
nor
what
he
has
now
,
''
observed
*NL*
Dalton
--
and
the
joke
appeared
to
him
so
good
that
,
being
left
alone
upon
*NL*
the
scene
,
he
continued
at
intervals
to
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
*NL*
in
order
to
wink
at
an
imaginary
audience
and
shake
luxuriously
with
*NL*
a
silent
,
ventral
laughter
,
mentally
rehearsing
the
dialogue
from
the
*NL*
beginning
,
that
he
might
recite
it
with
effect
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Arthur
went
up
to
his
dressing-room
again
after
luncheon
,
it
was
*NL*
inevitable
that
the
debate
he
had
had
with
himself
there
earlier
in
the
*NL*
day
should
flash
across
his
mind
;
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
now
*NL*
to
dwell
on
the
remembrance
--
impossible
to
recall
the
feelings
and
*NL*
reflections
which
had
been
decisive
with
him
then
,
any
more
than
to
*NL*
recall
the
peculiar
scent
of
the
air
that
had
freshened
him
when
he
*NL*
first
opened
his
window
.
The
desire
to
see
Hetty
had
rushed
back
like
an
*NL*
ill-stemmed
current
;
he
was
amazed
himself
at
the
force
with
which
this
*NL*
trivial
fancy
seemed
to
grasp
him
:
he
was
even
rather
tremulous
as
he
*NL*
brushed
his
hair
--
pooh
!
it
was
riding
in
that
break-neck
way
.
It
was
*NL*
because
he
had
made
a
serious
affair
of
an
idle
matter
,
by
thinking
of
*NL*
it
as
if
it
were
of
any
consequence
.
He
would
amuse
himself
by
seeing
*NL*
Hetty
to-day
,
and
get
rid
of
the
whole
thing
from
his
mind
.
It
was
all
*NL*
Irwine
's
fault
.
``
If
Irwine
had
said
nothing
,
I
should
n't
have
thought
*NL*
half
so
much
of
Hetty
as
of
Meg
's
lameness
.
''
However
,
it
was
just
the
*NL*
sort
of
day
for
lolling
in
the
Hermitage
,
and
he
would
go
and
finish
*NL*
Dr.
Moore
's
Zeluco
there
before
dinner
.
The
Hermitage
stood
in
Fir-tree
*NL*
Grove
--
the
way
Hetty
was
sure
to
come
in
walking
from
the
Hall
Farm
.
*NL*
So
nothing
could
be
simpler
and
more
natural
:
meeting
Hetty
was
a
mere
*NL*
circumstance
of
his
walk
,
not
its
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
shadow
flitted
rather
faster
among
the
sturdy
oaks
of
the
Chase
*NL*
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
shadow
of
a
tired
man
on
a
warm
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
it
was
still
scarcely
four
o'clock
when
he
stood
before
*NL*
the
tall
narrow
gate
leading
into
the
delicious
labyrinthine
wood
which
*NL*
skirted
one
side
of
the
Chase
,
and
which
was
called
Fir-tree
Grove
,
not
*NL*
because
the
firs
were
many
,
but
because
they
were
few
.
It
was
a
wood
*NL*
of
beeches
and
limes
,
with
here
and
there
a
light
silver-stemmed
*NL*
birch
--
just
the
sort
of
wood
most
haunted
by
the
nymphs
:
you
see
their
*NL*
white
sunlit
limbs
gleaming
athwart
the
boughs
,
or
peeping
from
behind
*NL*
the
smooth-sweeping
outline
of
a
tall
lime
;
you
hear
their
soft
liquid
*NL*
laughter
--
but
if
you
look
with
a
too
curious
sacrilegious
eye
,
they
*NL*
vanish
behind
the
silvery
beeches
,
they
make
you
believe
that
their
*NL*
voice
was
only
a
running
brooklet
,
perhaps
they
metamorphose
themselves
*NL*
into
a
tawny
squirrel
that
scampers
away
and
mocks
you
from
the
topmost
*NL*
bough
.
It
was
not
a
grove
with
measured
grass
or
rolled
gravel
for
you
*NL*
to
tread
upon
,
but
with
narrow
,
hollow-shaped
,
earthy
paths
,
edged
with
*NL*
faint
dashes
of
delicate
moss
--
paths
which
look
as
if
they
were
made
*NL*
by
the
free
will
of
the
trees
and
underwood
,
moving
reverently
aside
to
*NL*
look
at
the
tall
queen
of
the
white-footed
nymphs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
along
the
broadest
of
these
paths
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
passed
,
*NL*
under
an
avenue
of
limes
and
beeches
.
It
was
a
still
afternoon
--
the
*NL*
golden
light
was
lingering
languidly
among
the
upper
boughs
,
only
*NL*
glancing
down
here
and
there
on
the
purple
pathway
and
its
edge
of
*NL*
faintly
sprinkled
moss
:
an
afternoon
in
which
destiny
disguises
her
cold
*NL*
awful
face
behind
a
hazy
radiant
veil
,
encloses
us
in
warm
downy
*NL*
wings
,
and
poisons
us
with
violet-scented
breath
.
Arthur
strolled
along
*NL*
carelessly
,
with
a
book
under
his
arm
,
but
not
looking
on
the
ground
*NL*
as
meditative
men
are
apt
to
do
;
his
eyes
WOULD
fix
themselves
on
the
*NL*
distant
bend
in
the
road
round
which
a
little
figure
must
surely
appear
*NL*
before
long
.
Ah
!
There
she
comes
.
First
a
bright
patch
of
colour
,
like
*NL*
a
tropic
bird
among
the
boughs
;
then
a
tripping
figure
,
with
a
round
*NL*
hat
on
,
and
a
small
basket
under
her
arm
;
then
a
deep-blushing
,
almost
*NL*
frightened
,
but
bright-smiling
girl
,
making
her
curtsy
with
a
fluttered
*NL*
yet
happy
glance
,
as
Arthur
came
up
to
her
.
If
Arthur
had
had
time
*NL*
to
think
at
all
,
he
would
have
thought
it
strange
that
he
should
feel
*NL*
fluttered
too
,
be
conscious
of
blushing
too
--
in
fact
,
look
and
feel
as
*NL*
foolish
as
if
he
had
been
taken
by
surprise
instead
of
meeting
just
what
*NL*
he
expected
.
Poor
things
!
It
was
a
pity
they
were
not
in
that
golden
age
*NL*
of
childhood
when
they
would
have
stood
face
to
face
,
eyeing
each
other
*NL*
with
timid
liking
,
then
given
each
other
a
little
butterfly
kiss
,
*NL*
and
toddled
off
to
play
together
.
Arthur
would
have
gone
home
to
his
*NL*
silk-curtained
cot
,
and
Hetty
to
her
home-spun
pillow
,
and
both
would
*NL*
have
slept
without
dreams
,
and
to-morrow
would
have
been
a
life
hardly
*NL*
conscious
of
a
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
turned
round
and
walked
by
Hetty
's
side
without
giving
a
reason
.
*NL*
They
were
alone
together
for
the
first
time
.
What
an
overpowering
*NL*
presence
that
first
privacy
is
!
He
actually
dared
not
look
at
this
*NL*
little
butter-maker
for
the
first
minute
or
two
.
As
for
Hetty
,
her
feet
*NL*
rested
on
a
cloud
,
and
she
was
borne
along
by
warm
zephyrs
;
she
had
*NL*
forgotten
her
rose-coloured
ribbons
;
she
was
no
more
conscious
of
her
*NL*
limbs
than
if
her
childish
soul
had
passed
into
a
water-lily
,
resting
*NL*
on
a
liquid
bed
and
warmed
by
the
midsummer
sun-beams
.
It
may
seem
a
*NL*
contradiction
,
but
Arthur
gathered
a
certain
carelessness
and
confidence
*NL*
from
his
timidity
:
it
was
an
entirely
different
state
of
mind
from
what
*NL*
he
had
expected
in
such
a
meeting
with
Hetty
;
and
full
as
he
was
of
*NL*
vague
feeling
,
there
was
room
,
in
those
moments
of
silence
,
for
the
*NL*
thought
that
his
previous
debates
and
scruples
were
needless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
right
to
choose
this
way
of
coming
to
the
Chase
,
''
he
*NL*
said
at
last
,
looking
down
at
Hetty
;
``
it
is
so
much
prettier
as
well
as
*NL*
shorter
than
coming
by
either
of
the
lodges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
Hetty
answered
,
with
a
tremulous
,
almost
whispering
voice
.
*NL*
She
did
n't
know
one
bit
how
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
like
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
*NL*
her
very
vanity
made
her
more
coy
of
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
come
every
week
to
see
Mrs.
Pomfret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
every
Thursday
,
only
when
she
's
got
to
go
out
with
Miss
*NL*
Donnithorne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
's
teaching
you
something
,
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
the
lace-mending
as
she
learnt
abroad
,
and
the
*NL*
stocking-mending
--
it
looks
just
like
the
stocking
,
you
ca
n't
tell
it
's
*NL*
been
mended
;
and
she
teaches
me
cutting-out
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
are
YOU
going
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
be
one
very
much
indeed
.
''
Hetty
spoke
more
audibly
*NL*
now
,
but
still
rather
tremulously
;
she
thought
,
perhaps
she
seemed
as
*NL*
stupid
to
Captain
Donnithorne
as
Luke
Britton
did
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
Mrs.
Pomfret
always
expects
you
at
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
expects
me
at
four
o'clock
.
I
'm
rather
late
to-day
,
because
my
aunt
*NL*
could
n't
spare
me
;
but
the
regular
time
is
four
,
because
that
gives
us
*NL*
time
before
Miss
Donnithorne
's
bell
rings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
,
I
must
not
keep
you
now
,
else
I
should
like
to
show
you
the
*NL*
Hermitage
.
Did
you
ever
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
walk
where
we
turn
up
to
it
.
But
we
must
not
go
now
.
I
'll
*NL*
show
it
you
some
other
time
,
if
you
'd
like
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
always
come
back
this
way
in
the
evening
,
or
are
you
afraid
to
*NL*
come
so
lonely
a
road
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
sir
,
it
's
never
late
;
I
always
set
out
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
it
's
so
light
now
in
the
evening
.
My
aunt
would
be
angry
with
me
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
get
home
before
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
comes
to
take
care
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
deep
blush
overspread
Hetty
's
face
and
neck
.
``
I
'm
sure
he
does
n't
;
*NL*
I
'm
sure
he
never
did
;
I
would
n't
let
him
;
I
do
n't
like
him
,
''
she
said
*NL*
hastily
,
and
the
tears
of
vexation
had
come
so
fast
that
before
she
had
*NL*
done
speaking
a
bright
drop
rolled
down
her
hot
cheek
.
Then
she
felt
*NL*
ashamed
to
death
that
she
was
crying
,
and
for
one
long
instant
her
*NL*
happiness
was
all
gone
.
But
in
the
next
she
felt
an
arm
steal
round
her
,
*NL*
and
a
gentle
voice
said
,
``
Why
,
Hetty
,
what
makes
you
cry
?
I
did
n't
mean
*NL*
to
vex
you
.
I
would
n't
vex
you
for
the
world
,
you
little
blossom
.
Come
,
*NL*
do
n't
cry
;
look
at
me
,
else
I
shall
think
you
wo
n't
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
had
laid
his
hand
on
the
soft
arm
that
was
nearest
to
him
,
and
*NL*
was
stooping
towards
Hetty
with
a
look
of
coaxing
entreaty
.
Hetty
lifted
*NL*
her
long
dewy
lashes
,
and
met
the
eyes
that
were
bent
towards
her
with
a
*NL*
sweet
,
timid
,
beseeching
look
.
What
a
space
of
time
those
three
moments
*NL*
were
while
their
eyes
met
and
his
arms
touched
her
!
Love
is
such
a
*NL*
simple
thing
when
we
have
only
one-and-twenty
summers
and
a
sweet
girl
*NL*
of
seventeen
trembles
under
our
glance
,
as
if
she
were
a
bud
first
*NL*
opening
her
heart
with
wondering
rapture
to
the
morning
.
Such
young
*NL*
unfurrowed
souls
roll
to
meet
each
other
like
two
velvet
peaches
that
*NL*
touch
softly
and
are
at
rest
;
they
mingle
as
easily
as
two
brooklets
*NL*
that
ask
for
nothing
but
to
entwine
themselves
and
ripple
with
*NL*
ever-interlacing
curves
in
the
leafiest
hiding-places
.
While
Arthur
*NL*
gazed
into
Hetty
's
dark
beseeching
eyes
,
it
made
no
difference
to
him
*NL*
what
sort
of
English
she
spoke
;
and
even
if
hoops
and
powder
had
been
*NL*
in
fashion
,
he
would
very
likely
not
have
been
sensible
just
then
that
*NL*
Hetty
wanted
those
signs
of
high
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
started
asunder
with
beating
hearts
:
something
had
fallen
on
*NL*
the
ground
with
a
rattling
noise
;
it
was
Hetty
's
basket
;
all
her
little
*NL*
workwoman
's
matters
were
scattered
on
the
path
,
some
of
them
showing
*NL*
a
capability
of
rolling
to
great
lengths
.
There
was
much
to
be
done
in
*NL*
picking
up
,
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
;
but
when
Arthur
hung
the
basket
*NL*
over
her
arm
again
,
the
poor
child
felt
a
strange
difference
in
his
look
*NL*
and
manner
.
He
just
pressed
her
hand
,
and
said
,
with
a
look
and
tone
*NL*
that
were
almost
chilling
to
her
,
``
I
have
been
hindering
you
;
I
must
not
*NL*
keep
you
any
longer
now
.
You
will
be
expected
at
the
house
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
her
to
speak
,
he
turned
away
from
her
and
hurried
*NL*
back
towards
the
road
that
led
to
the
Hermitage
,
leaving
Hetty
to
pursue
*NL*
her
way
in
a
strange
dream
that
seemed
to
have
begun
in
bewildering
*NL*
delight
and
was
now
passing
into
contrarieties
and
sadness
.
Would
he
*NL*
meet
her
again
as
she
came
home
?
Why
had
he
spoken
almost
as
if
he
were
*NL*
displeased
with
her
?
And
then
run
away
so
suddenly
?
She
cried
,
hardly
*NL*
knowing
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
too
was
very
uneasy
,
but
his
feelings
were
lit
up
for
him
by
a
*NL*
more
distinct
consciousness
.
He
hurried
to
the
Hermitage
,
which
stood
in
*NL*
the
heart
of
the
wood
,
unlocked
the
door
with
a
hasty
wrench
,
slammed
*NL*
it
after
him
,
pitched
Zeluco
into
the
most
distant
corner
,
and
thrusting
*NL*
his
right
hand
into
his
pocket
,
first
walked
four
or
five
times
up
and
*NL*
down
the
scanty
length
of
the
little
room
,
and
then
seated
himself
on
*NL*
the
ottoman
in
an
uncomfortable
stiff
way
,
as
we
often
do
when
we
wish
*NL*
not
to
abandon
ourselves
to
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
getting
in
love
with
Hetty
--
that
was
quite
plain
.
He
was
ready
*NL*
to
pitch
everything
else
--
no
matter
where
--
for
the
sake
of
surrendering
*NL*
himself
to
this
delicious
feeling
which
had
just
disclosed
itself
.
It
*NL*
was
no
use
blinking
the
fact
now
--
they
would
get
too
fond
of
each
other
,
*NL*
if
he
went
on
taking
notice
of
her
--
and
what
would
come
of
it
?
He
should
*NL*
have
to
go
away
in
a
few
weeks
,
and
the
poor
little
thing
would
be
*NL*
miserable
.
He
MUST
NOT
see
her
alone
again
;
he
must
keep
out
of
her
way
.
*NL*
What
a
fool
he
was
for
coming
back
from
Gawaine
's
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
threw
open
the
windows
,
to
let
in
the
soft
breath
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
the
healthy
scent
of
the
firs
that
made
a
belt
round
the
*NL*
Hermitage
.
The
soft
air
did
not
help
his
resolution
,
as
he
leaned
out
*NL*
and
looked
into
the
leafy
distance
.
But
he
considered
his
resolution
*NL*
sufficiently
fixed
:
there
was
no
need
to
debate
with
himself
any
longer
.
*NL*
He
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
meet
Hetty
again
;
and
now
he
might
*NL*
give
himself
up
to
thinking
how
immensely
agreeable
it
would
be
if
*NL*
circumstances
were
different
--
how
pleasant
it
would
have
been
to
meet
*NL*
her
this
evening
as
she
came
back
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
again
and
*NL*
look
into
her
sweet
face
.
He
wondered
if
the
dear
little
thing
were
*NL*
thinking
of
him
too
--
twenty
to
one
she
was
.
How
beautiful
her
eyes
were
*NL*
with
the
tear
on
their
lashes
!
He
would
like
to
satisfy
his
soul
for
a
*NL*
day
with
looking
at
them
,
and
he
MUST
see
her
again
--
he
must
see
her
,
*NL*
simply
to
remove
any
false
impression
from
her
mind
about
his
manner
*NL*
to
her
just
now
.
He
would
behave
in
a
quiet
,
kind
way
to
her
--
just
to
*NL*
prevent
her
from
going
home
with
her
head
full
of
wrong
fancies
.
Yes
,
*NL*
that
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
while
--
more
than
an
hour
before
Arthur
had
brought
his
*NL*
meditations
to
this
point
;
but
once
arrived
there
,
he
could
stay
no
*NL*
longer
at
the
Hermitage
.
The
time
must
be
filled
up
with
movement
until
*NL*
he
should
see
Hetty
again
.
And
it
was
already
late
enough
to
go
and
*NL*
dress
for
dinner
,
for
his
grandfather
's
dinner-hour
was
six
.

Chapter
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
in
the
Wood
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
happened
that
Mrs.
Pomfret
had
had
a
slight
quarrel
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Best
,
the
housekeeper
,
on
this
Thursday
morning
--
a
fact
which
had
two
*NL*
consequences
highly
convenient
to
Hetty
.
It
caused
Mrs.
Pomfret
to
have
*NL*
tea
sent
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
it
inspired
that
exemplary
lady
's
maid
*NL*
with
so
lively
a
recollection
of
former
passages
in
Mrs.
Best
's
conduct
,
*NL*
and
of
dialogues
in
which
Mrs.
Best
had
decidedly
the
inferiority
as
an
*NL*
interlocutor
with
Mrs.
Pomfret
,
that
Hetty
required
no
more
presence
*NL*
of
mind
than
was
demanded
for
using
her
needle
,
and
throwing
in
an
*NL*
occasional
``
yes
''
or
``
no
.
''
She
would
have
wanted
to
put
on
her
hat
*NL*
earlier
than
usual
;
only
she
had
told
Captain
Donnithorne
that
she
*NL*
usually
set
out
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
if
he
SHOULD
go
to
the
Grove
*NL*
again
expecting
to
see
her
,
and
she
should
be
gone
!
Would
he
come
?
Her
*NL*
little
butterfly
soul
fluttered
incessantly
between
memory
and
dubious
*NL*
expectation
.
At
last
the
minute-hand
of
the
old-fashioned
brazen-faced
*NL*
timepiece
was
on
the
last
quarter
to
eight
,
and
there
was
every
reason
*NL*
for
its
being
time
to
get
ready
for
departure
.
Even
Mrs.
Pomfret
's
*NL*
preoccupied
mind
did
not
prevent
her
from
noticing
what
looked
like
a
*NL*
new
flush
of
beauty
in
the
little
thing
as
she
tied
on
her
hat
before
*NL*
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
child
gets
prettier
and
prettier
every
day
,
I
do
believe
,
''
was
her
*NL*
inward
comment
.
``
The
more
's
the
pity
.
She
'll
get
neither
a
place
nor
*NL*
a
husband
any
the
sooner
for
it
.
Sober
well-to-do
men
do
n't
like
such
*NL*
pretty
wives
.
When
I
was
a
girl
,
I
was
more
admired
than
if
I
had
been
*NL*
so
very
pretty
.
However
,
she
's
reason
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
teaching
*NL*
her
something
to
get
her
bread
with
,
better
than
farm-house
work
.
They
*NL*
always
told
me
I
was
good-natured
--
and
that
's
the
truth
,
and
to
my
hurt
*NL*
too
,
else
there
's
them
in
this
house
that
would
n't
be
here
now
to
lord
*NL*
it
over
me
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
walked
hastily
across
the
short
space
of
pleasure-ground
which
she
*NL*
had
to
traverse
,
dreading
to
meet
Mr.
Craig
,
to
whom
she
could
hardly
*NL*
have
spoken
civilly
.
How
relieved
she
was
when
she
had
got
safely
under
*NL*
the
oaks
and
among
the
fern
of
the
Chase
!
Even
then
she
was
as
ready
to
*NL*
be
startled
as
the
deer
that
leaped
away
at
her
approach
.
She
thought
*NL*
nothing
of
the
evening
light
that
lay
gently
in
the
grassy
alleys
*NL*
between
the
fern
,
and
made
the
beauty
of
their
living
green
more
visible
*NL*
than
it
had
been
in
the
overpowering
flood
of
noon
:
she
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
that
was
present
.
She
only
saw
something
that
was
possible
:
Mr.
*NL*
Arthur
Donnithorne
coming
to
meet
her
again
along
the
Fir-tree
Grove
.
*NL*
That
was
the
foreground
of
Hetty
's
picture
;
behind
it
lay
a
bright
hazy
*NL*
something
--
days
that
were
not
to
be
as
the
other
days
of
her
life
had
*NL*
been
.
It
was
as
if
she
had
been
wooed
by
a
river-god
,
who
might
any
*NL*
time
take
her
to
his
wondrous
halls
below
a
watery
heaven
.
There
was
no
*NL*
knowing
what
would
come
,
since
this
strange
entrancing
delight
had
come
.
*NL*
If
a
chest
full
of
lace
and
satin
and
jewels
had
been
sent
her
from
some
*NL*
unknown
source
,
how
could
she
but
have
thought
that
her
whole
lot
was
*NL*
going
to
change
,
and
that
to-morrow
some
still
more
bewildering
joy
*NL*
would
befall
her
?
Hetty
had
never
read
a
novel
;
if
she
had
ever
seen
*NL*
one
,
I
think
the
words
would
have
been
too
hard
for
her
;
how
then
could
*NL*
she
find
a
shape
for
her
expectations
?
They
were
as
formless
as
the
*NL*
sweet
languid
odours
of
the
garden
at
the
Chase
,
which
had
floated
past
*NL*
her
as
she
walked
by
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
is
at
another
gate
now
--
that
leading
into
Fir-tree
Grove
.
She
enters
*NL*
the
wood
,
where
it
is
already
twilight
,
and
at
every
step
she
takes
,
the
*NL*
fear
at
her
heart
becomes
colder
.
If
he
should
not
come
!
Oh
,
how
dreary
*NL*
it
was
--
the
thought
of
going
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
wood
,
into
the
*NL*
unsheltered
road
,
without
having
seen
him
.
She
reaches
the
first
turning
*NL*
towards
the
Hermitage
,
walking
slowly
--
he
is
not
there
.
She
hates
the
*NL*
leveret
that
runs
across
the
path
;
she
hates
everything
that
is
not
what
*NL*
she
longs
for
.
She
walks
on
,
happy
whenever
she
is
coming
to
a
bend
in
*NL*
the
road
,
for
perhaps
he
is
behind
it
.
No
.
She
is
beginning
to
cry
:
her
*NL*
heart
has
swelled
so
,
the
tears
stand
in
her
eyes
;
she
gives
one
great
*NL*
sob
,
while
the
corners
of
her
mouth
quiver
,
and
the
tears
roll
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
does
n't
know
that
there
is
another
turning
to
the
Hermitage
,
that
*NL*
she
is
close
against
it
,
and
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
is
only
a
few
yards
*NL*
from
her
,
full
of
one
thought
,
and
a
thought
of
which
she
only
is
the
*NL*
object
.
He
is
going
to
see
Hetty
again
:
that
is
the
longing
which
has
*NL*
been
growing
through
the
last
three
hours
to
a
feverish
thirst
.
Not
,
*NL*
of
course
,
to
speak
in
the
caressing
way
into
which
he
had
unguardedly
*NL*
fallen
before
dinner
,
but
to
set
things
right
with
her
by
a
kindness
*NL*
which
would
have
the
air
of
friendly
civility
,
and
prevent
her
from
*NL*
running
away
with
wrong
notions
about
their
mutual
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Hetty
had
known
he
was
there
,
she
would
not
have
cried
;
and
it
would
*NL*
have
been
better
,
for
then
Arthur
would
perhaps
have
behaved
as
wisely
*NL*
as
he
had
intended
.
As
it
was
,
she
started
when
he
appeared
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
side-alley
,
and
looked
up
at
him
with
two
great
drops
rolling
*NL*
down
her
cheeks
.
What
else
could
he
do
but
speak
to
her
in
a
soft
,
*NL*
soothing
tone
,
as
if
she
were
a
bright-eyed
spaniel
with
a
thorn
in
her
*NL*
foot
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
something
frightened
you
,
Hetty
?
Have
you
seen
anything
in
the
*NL*
wood
?
Do
n't
be
frightened
--
I
'll
take
care
of
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
blushing
so
,
she
did
n't
know
whether
she
was
happy
or
*NL*
miserable
.
To
be
crying
again
--
what
did
gentlemen
think
of
girls
who
*NL*
cried
in
that
way
?
She
felt
unable
even
to
say
``
no
,
''
but
could
only
look
*NL*
away
from
him
and
wipe
the
tears
from
her
cheek
.
Not
before
a
great
drop
*NL*
had
fallen
on
her
rose-coloured
strings
--
she
knew
that
quite
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
be
cheerful
again
.
Smile
at
me
,
and
tell
me
what
's
the
matter
.
*NL*
Come
,
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
turned
her
head
towards
him
,
whispered
,
``
I
thought
you
would
n't
*NL*
come
,
''
and
slowly
got
courage
to
lift
her
eyes
to
him
.
That
look
was
too
*NL*
much
:
he
must
have
had
eyes
of
Egyptian
granite
not
to
look
too
lovingly
*NL*
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
little
frightened
bird
!
Little
tearful
rose
!
Silly
pet
!
You
wo
n't
*NL*
cry
again
,
now
I
'm
with
you
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
he
does
n't
know
in
the
least
what
he
is
saying
.
This
is
not
what
*NL*
he
meant
to
say
.
His
arm
is
stealing
round
the
waist
again
;
it
is
*NL*
tightening
its
clasp
;
he
is
bending
his
face
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
*NL*
round
cheek
;
his
lips
are
meeting
those
pouting
child-lips
,
and
for
a
*NL*
long
moment
time
has
vanished
.
He
may
be
a
shepherd
in
Arcadia
for
aught
*NL*
he
knows
,
he
may
be
the
first
youth
kissing
the
first
maiden
,
he
may
be
*NL*
Eros
himself
,
sipping
the
lips
of
Psyche
--
it
is
all
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
speaking
for
minutes
after
.
They
walked
along
with
beating
*NL*
hearts
till
they
came
within
sight
of
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
Then
they
looked
at
each
other
,
not
quite
as
they
had
looked
before
,
for
*NL*
in
their
eyes
there
was
the
memory
of
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
already
something
bitter
had
begun
to
mingle
itself
with
the
*NL*
fountain
of
sweets
:
already
Arthur
was
uncomfortable
.
He
took
his
arm
*NL*
from
Hetty
's
waist
,
and
said
,
``
Here
we
are
,
almost
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
Grove
.
I
wonder
how
late
it
is
,
''
he
added
,
pulling
out
his
watch
.
*NL*
``
Twenty
minutes
past
eight
--
but
my
watch
is
too
fast
.
However
,
I
'd
*NL*
better
not
go
any
further
now
.
Trot
along
quickly
with
your
little
feet
,
*NL*
and
get
home
safely
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
,
and
looked
at
her
half-sadly
,
half
with
a
constrained
*NL*
smile
.
Hetty
's
eyes
seemed
to
beseech
him
not
to
go
away
yet
;
but
he
*NL*
patted
her
cheek
and
said
``
Good-bye
''
again
.
She
was
obliged
to
turn
away
*NL*
from
him
and
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Arthur
,
he
rushed
back
through
the
wood
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
*NL*
a
wide
space
between
himself
and
Hetty
.
He
would
not
go
to
the
Hermitage
*NL*
again
;
he
remembered
how
he
had
debated
with
himself
there
before
*NL*
dinner
,
and
it
had
all
come
to
nothing
--
worse
than
nothing
.
He
walked
*NL*
right
on
into
the
Chase
,
glad
to
get
out
of
the
Grove
,
which
surely
was
*NL*
haunted
by
his
evil
genius
.
Those
beeches
and
smooth
limes
--
there
was
*NL*
something
enervating
in
the
very
sight
of
them
;
but
the
strong
knotted
*NL*
old
oaks
had
no
bending
languor
in
them
--
the
sight
of
them
would
give
*NL*
a
man
some
energy
.
Arthur
lost
himself
among
the
narrow
openings
in
*NL*
the
fern
,
winding
about
without
seeking
any
issue
,
till
the
twilight
*NL*
deepened
almost
to
night
under
the
great
boughs
,
and
the
hare
looked
*NL*
black
as
it
darted
across
his
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
feeling
much
more
strongly
than
he
had
done
in
the
morning
:
it
*NL*
was
as
if
his
horse
had
wheeled
round
from
a
leap
and
dared
to
dispute
*NL*
his
mastery
.
He
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
,
irritated
,
mortified
.
He
*NL*
no
sooner
fixed
his
mind
on
the
probable
consequences
of
giving
way
to
*NL*
the
emotions
which
had
stolen
over
him
to-day
--
of
continuing
to
notice
*NL*
Hetty
,
of
allowing
himself
any
opportunity
for
such
slight
caresses
as
*NL*
he
had
been
betrayed
into
already
--
than
he
refused
to
believe
such
a
*NL*
future
possible
for
himself
.
To
flirt
with
Hetty
was
a
very
different
*NL*
affair
from
flirting
with
a
pretty
girl
of
his
own
station
:
that
was
*NL*
understood
to
be
an
amusement
on
both
sides
,
or
,
if
it
became
serious
,
*NL*
there
was
no
obstacle
to
marriage
.
But
this
little
thing
would
be
spoken
*NL*
ill
of
directly
,
if
she
happened
to
be
seen
walking
with
him
;
and
then
*NL*
those
excellent
people
,
the
Poysers
,
to
whom
a
good
name
was
as
precious
*NL*
as
if
they
had
the
best
blood
in
the
land
in
their
veins
--
he
should
hate
*NL*
himself
if
he
made
a
scandal
of
that
sort
,
on
the
estate
that
was
to
be
*NL*
his
own
some
day
,
and
among
tenants
by
whom
he
liked
,
above
all
,
to
be
*NL*
respected
.
He
could
no
more
believe
that
he
should
so
fall
in
his
own
*NL*
esteem
than
that
he
should
break
both
his
legs
and
go
on
crutches
all
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
life
.
He
could
n't
imagine
himself
in
that
position
;
it
*NL*
was
too
odious
,
too
unlike
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
even
if
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
,
they
might
get
too
fond
of
*NL*
each
other
,
and
then
there
could
be
nothing
but
the
misery
of
parting
,
*NL*
after
all
.
No
gentleman
,
out
of
a
ballad
,
could
marry
a
farmer
's
niece
.
*NL*
There
must
be
an
end
to
the
whole
thing
at
once
.
It
was
too
foolish
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
had
been
so
determined
this
morning
,
before
he
went
to
*NL*
Gawaine
's
;
and
while
he
was
there
something
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
*NL*
made
him
gallop
back
.
It
seemed
he
could
n't
quite
depend
on
his
own
*NL*
resolution
,
as
he
had
thought
he
could
;
he
almost
wished
his
arm
would
*NL*
get
painful
again
,
and
then
he
should
think
of
nothing
but
the
comfort
*NL*
it
would
be
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
.
There
was
no
knowing
what
impulse
*NL*
might
seize
him
to-morrow
,
in
this
confounded
place
,
where
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
occupy
him
imperiously
through
the
livelong
day
.
What
could
*NL*
he
do
to
secure
himself
from
any
more
of
this
folly
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
resource
.
He
would
go
and
tell
Irwine
--
tell
him
*NL*
everything
.
The
mere
act
of
telling
it
would
make
it
seem
trivial
;
the
*NL*
temptation
would
vanish
,
as
the
charm
of
fond
words
vanishes
when
one
*NL*
repeats
them
to
the
indifferent
.
In
every
way
it
would
help
him
to
tell
*NL*
Irwine
.
He
would
ride
to
Broxton
Rectory
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
*NL*
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
had
no
sooner
come
to
this
determination
than
he
began
to
think
*NL*
which
of
the
paths
would
lead
him
home
,
and
made
as
short
a
walk
thither
*NL*
as
he
could
.
He
felt
sure
he
should
sleep
now
:
he
had
had
enough
to
tire
*NL*
him
,
and
there
was
no
more
need
for
him
to
think
.

The
Return
Home
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WHILE
that
parting
in
the
wood
was
happening
,
there
was
a
parting
in
the
*NL*
cottage
too
,
and
Lisbeth
had
stood
with
Adam
at
the
door
,
straining
her
*NL*
aged
eyes
to
get
the
last
glimpse
of
Seth
and
Dinah
,
as
they
mounted
the
*NL*
opposite
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
'm
loath
to
see
the
last
on
her
,
''
she
said
to
Adam
,
as
they
turned
*NL*
into
the
house
again
.
``
I
'd
ha
'
been
willin
'
t
'
ha
'
her
about
me
till
*NL*
I
died
and
went
to
lie
by
my
old
man
.
She
'd
make
it
easier
dyin
'
--
she
*NL*
spakes
so
gentle
an
'
moves
about
so
still
.
I
could
be
fast
sure
that
*NL*
pictur
'
was
drawed
for
her
i
'
thy
new
Bible
--
th
'
angel
a-sittin
'
on
the
*NL*
big
stone
by
the
grave
.
Eh
,
I
wouldna
mind
ha'in
a
daughter
like
that
;
*NL*
but
nobody
ne'er
marries
them
as
is
good
for
aught

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mother
,
I
hope
thee
WILT
have
her
for
a
daughter
;
for
Seth
's
got
*NL*
a
liking
for
her
,
and
I
hope
she
'll
get
a
liking
for
Seth
in
time
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
th
'
use

'
talkin

a-that

She
caresna
for

She

*NL*
away
twenty
mile
aff
.
How
's
she
to
get
a
likin
'
for
him
,
I
'd
like
to
*NL*
know
?
No
more
nor
the
cake

the
leaven

Thy
figurin

*NL*
books
might
ha

I
should

else
thee

commin

as
Seth
allays
does

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
laughing
,
``
the
figures
tell
us
a
fine
deal
,
*NL*
and
we
could
n't
go
far
without
'em

but
they
do
n't
tell
us
about
folks
's
*NL*
feelings
.
It
's
a
nicer
job
to
calculate
THEM
.
But
Seth
's
as
good-hearted
*NL*
a
lad
as
ever
handled
a
tool
,
and
plenty
o
'
sense
,
and
good-looking
too
;
*NL*
and
he
's
got
the
same
way
o
'
thinking
as
Dinah
.
He
deserves
to
win
her
,
*NL*
though
there
's
no
denying
she
's
a
rare
bit
o
'
workmanship
.
You
do
n't
see
*NL*
such
women
turned
off
the
wheel
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

Thee

But
what
's
Seth
got
to
do
with
marryin

,
as
is
on
'
y
*NL*
three-an

-

He
'd
more

an

sixpence

An
'
as

for
his
desarving
her
--
she
's
two
`
ear
older
nor
Seth
:
she
's
pretty
*NL*
near
as
old
as
thee
.
But
that
's
the
way
;
folks
mun
allays
choose
by
*NL*
contrairies
,
as
if
they
must
be
sorted
like
the
pork
--
a
bit
o
'
good
meat
*NL*
wi
'
a
bit
o
'
offal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
feminine
mind
in
some
of
its
moods
,
all
things
that
might
be
*NL*
receive
a
temporary
charm
from
comparison
with
what
is
;
and
since
Adam
*NL*
did
not
want
to
marry
Dinah
himself
,
Lisbeth
felt
rather
peevish
on
that
*NL*
score
--
as
peevish
as
she
would
have
been
if
he
HAD
wanted
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
and
so
shut
himself
out
from
Mary
Burge
and
the
partnership
as
*NL*
effectually
as
by
marrying
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
than
half-past
eight
when
Adam
and
his
mother
were
talking
*NL*
in
this
way
,
so
that
when
,
about
ten
minutes
later
,
Hetty
reached
the
*NL*
turning
of
the
lane
that
led
to
the
farmyard
gate
,
she
saw
Dinah
and
*NL*
Seth
approaching
it
from
the
opposite
direction
,
and
waited
for
them
to
*NL*
come
up
to
her
.
They
,
too
,
like
Hetty
,
had
lingered
a
little
in
their
*NL*
walk
,
for
Dinah
was
trying
to
speak
words
of
comfort
and
strength
to
*NL*
Seth
in
these
parting
moments
.
But
when
they
saw
Hetty
,
they
paused
and
*NL*
shook
hands
;
Seth
turned
homewards
,
and
Dinah
came
on
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seth
Bede
would
have
come
and
spoken
to
you
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
as
she
*NL*
reached
Hetty
,
``
but
he
's
very
full
of
trouble
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
answered
with
a
dimpled
smile
,
as
if
she
did
not
quite
know
what
*NL*
had
been
said
;
and
it
made
a
strange
contrast
to
see
that
sparkling
*NL*
self-engrossed
loveliness
looked
at
by
Dinah
's
calm
pitying
face
,
with
*NL*
its
open
glance
which
told
that
her
heart
lived
in
no
cherished
secrets
*NL*
of
its
own
,
but
in
feelings
which
it
longed
to
share
with
all
the
world
.
*NL*
Hetty
liked
Dinah
as
well
as
she
had
ever
liked
any
woman
;
how
was
it
*NL*
possible
to
feel
otherwise
towards
one
who
always
put
in
a
kind
word
for
*NL*
her
when
her
aunt
was
finding
fault
,
and
who
was
always
ready
to
take
*NL*
Totty
off
her
hands
--
little
tiresome
Totty
,
that
was
made
such
a
pet
of
*NL*
by
every
one
,
and
that
Hetty
could
see
no
interest
in
at
all
?
Dinah
*NL*
had
never
said
anything
disapproving
or
reproachful
to
Hetty
during
her
*NL*
whole
visit
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
she
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
in
a
*NL*
serious
way
,
but
Hetty
did
n't
mind
that
much
,
for
she
never
listened
:
*NL*
whatever
Dinah
might
say
,
she
almost
always
stroked
Hetty
's
cheek
after
*NL*
it
,
and
wanted
to
do
some
mending
for
her
.
Dinah
was
a
riddle
to
her
;
*NL*
Hetty
looked
at
her
much
in
the
same
way
as
one
might
imagine
a
little
*NL*
perching
bird
that
could
only
flutter
from
bough
to
bough
,
to
look
at
*NL*
the
swoop
of
the
swallow
or
the
mounting
of
the
lark
;
but
she
did
not
*NL*
care
to
solve
such
riddles
,
any
more
than
she
cared
to
know
what
was
*NL*
meant
by
the
pictures
in
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
or
in
the
old
folio
*NL*
Bible
that
Marty
and
Tommy
always
plagued
her
about
on
a
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
took
her
hand
now
and
drew
it
under
her
own
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
very
happy
to-night
,
dear
child
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
shall
think
of
*NL*
you
often
when
I
'm
at
Snowfield
,
and
see
your
face
before
me
as
it
is
*NL*
now
.
It
's
a
strange
thing
--
sometimes
when
I
'm
quite
alone
,
sitting
in
*NL*
my
room
with
my
eyes
closed
,
or
walking
over
the
hills
,
the
people
I
've
*NL*
seen
and
known
,
if
it
's
only
been
for
a
few
days
,
are
brought
before
me
,
*NL*
and
I
hear
their
voices
and
see
them
look
and
move
almost
plainer
than
*NL*
I
ever
did
when
they
were
really
with
me
so
as
I
could
touch
them
.
And
*NL*
then
my
heart
is
drawn
out
towards
them
,
and
I
feel
their
lot
as
if
*NL*
it
was
my
own
,
and
I
take
comfort
in
spreading
it
before
the
Lord
and
*NL*
resting
in
His
love
,
on
their
behalf
as
well
as
my
own
.
And
so
I
feel
*NL*
sure
you
will
come
before
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
a
moment
,
but
Hetty
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
a
very
precious
time
to
me
,
''
Dinah
went
on
,
``
last
night
*NL*
and
to-day
--
seeing
two
such
good
sons
as
Adam
and
Seth
Bede
.
They
are
so
*NL*
tender
and
thoughtful
for
their
aged
mother
.
And
she
has
been
telling
*NL*
me
what
Adam
has
done
,
for
these
many
years
,
to
help
his
father
and
his
*NL*
brother
;
it
's
wonderful
what
a
spirit
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
he
has
,
*NL*
and
how
he
's
ready
to
use
it
all
in
behalf
of
them
that
are
feeble
.
And
*NL*
I
'm
sure
he
has
a
loving
spirit
too
.
I
've
noticed
it
often
among
my
*NL*
own
people
round
Snowfield
,
that
the
strong
,
skilful
men
are
often
the
*NL*
gentlest
to
the
women
and
children
;
and
it
's
pretty
to
see
'em
carrying
*NL*
the
little
babies
as
if
they
were
no
heavier
than
little
birds
.
And
the
*NL*
babies
always
seem
to
like
the
strong
arm
best
.
I
feel
sure
it
would
be
*NL*
so
with
Adam
Bede
.
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Hetty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
abstractedly
,
for
her
mind
had
been
all
the
while
*NL*
in
the
wood
,
and
she
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
what
she
was
*NL*
assenting
to
.
Dinah
saw
she
was
not
inclined
to
talk
,
but
there
would
*NL*
not
have
been
time
to
say
much
more
,
for
they
were
now
at
the
yard-gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
still
twilight
,
with
its
dying
western
red
and
its
few
faint
*NL*
struggling
stars
,
rested
on
the
farm-yard
,
where
there
was
not
a
sound
*NL*
to
be
heard
but
the
stamping
of
the
cart-horses
in
the
stable
.
It
was
*NL*
about
twenty
minutes
after
sunset
.
The
fowls
were
all
gone
to
roost
,
*NL*
and
the
bull-dog
lay
stretched
on
the
straw
outside
his
kennel
,
with
*NL*
the
black-and-tan
terrier
by
his
side
,
when
the
falling-to
of
the
gate
*NL*
disturbed
them
and
set
them
barking
,
like
good
officials
,
before
they
*NL*
had
any
distinct
knowledge
of
the
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barking
had
its
effect
in
the
house
,
for
,
as
Dinah
and
Hetty
*NL*
approached
,
the
doorway
was
filled
by
a
portly
figure
,
with
a
ruddy
*NL*
black-eyed
face
which
bore
in
it
the
possibility
of
looking
extremely
*NL*
acute
,
and
occasionally
contemptuous
,
on
market-days
,
but
had
now
a
*NL*
predominant
after-supper
expression
of
hearty
good-nature
.
It
is
well
*NL*
known
that
great
scholars
who
have
shown
the
most
pitiless
acerbity
in
*NL*
their
criticism
of
other
men
's
scholarship
have
yet
been
of
a
relenting
*NL*
and
indulgent
temper
in
private
life
;
and
I
have
heard
of
a
learned
man
*NL*
meekly
rocking
the
twins
in
the
cradle
with
his
left
hand
,
while
with
*NL*
his
right
he
inflicted
the
most
lacerating
sarcasms
on
an
opponent
who
*NL*
had
betrayed
a
brutal
ignorance
of
Hebrew
.
Weaknesses
and
errors
must
*NL*
be
forgiven
--
alas
!
they
are
not
alien
to
us
--
but
the
man
who
takes
the
*NL*
wrong
side
on
the
momentous
subject
of
the
Hebrew
points
must
be
treated
*NL*
as
the
enemy
of
his
race
.
There
was
the
same
sort
of
antithetic
mixture
*NL*
in
Martin
Poyser
:
he
was
of
so
excellent
a
disposition
that
he
had
been
*NL*
kinder
and
more
respectful
than
ever
to
his
old
father
since
he
had
made
*NL*
a
deed
of
gift
of
all
his
property
,
and
no
man
judged
his
neighbours
*NL*
more
charitably
on
all
personal
matters
;
but
for
a
farmer
,
like
Luke
*NL*
Britton
,
for
example
,
whose
fallows
were
not
well
cleaned
,
who
did
n't
*NL*
know
the
rudiments
of
hedging
and
ditching
,
and
showed
but
a
small
share
*NL*
of
judgment
in
the
purchase
of
winter
stock
,
Martin
Poyser
was
as
hard
*NL*
and
implacable
as
the
north-east
wind
.
Luke
Britton
could
not
make
a
*NL*
remark
,
even
on
the
weather
,
but
Martin
Poyser
detected
in
it
a
taint
*NL*
of
that
unsoundness
and
general
ignorance
which
was
palpable
in
all
his
*NL*
farming
operations
.
He
hated
to
see
the
fellow
lift
the
pewter
pint
to
*NL*
his
mouth
in
the
bar
of
the
Royal
George
on
market-day
,
and
the
mere
*NL*
sight
of
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
brought
a
severe
and
critical
*NL*
expression
into
his
black
eyes
,
as
different
as
possible
from
the
*NL*
fatherly
glance
he
bent
on
his
two
nieces
as
they
approached
the
door
.
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
had
smoked
his
evening
pipe
,
and
now
held
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
as
the
only
resource
of
a
man
who
continues
to
sit
up
after
the
*NL*
day
's
business
is
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
lasses
,
ye
're
rather
late
to-night
,
''
he
said
,
when
they
reached
*NL*
the
little
gate
leading
into
the
causeway
.
``
The
mother
's
begun
to
fidget
*NL*
about
you

An

how
did
you
leave
the
*NL*
old
woman
Bede
,
Dinah
?
Is
she
much
down
about
the
old
man
?
He
'd
been
but
*NL*
a
poor
bargain
to
her
this
five
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
greatly
distressed
for
the
loss
of
him
,
''
said
Dinah
,
``
but
*NL*
she
's
seemed
more
comforted
to-day

Her
son
Adam
's
been
at

all

*NL*
working
at
his
father
's
coffin
,
and
she
loves
to
have
him
at

She
's
*NL*
been
talking
about
him
to
me
almost
all
the
day

She
has
a
loving
heart
,
*NL*
though
she
's
sorely
given
to
fret
and
be
fearful

I
wish
she
had
a
surer

trust
to
comfort
her
in
her
old
age

*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
's
sure
enough
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
misunderstanding
Dinah
's
wish
.
*NL*
``
There
's
no
fear

he
'll
yield
well

the
threshing

not

o

I
'll
be

for
him
any

*NL*
he
'll
be
a
good

Did
he
say
he

be
coming
to
see
us
*NL*
soon
?
But
come
in

come
in

he
added
,
making
way
for
them
;
``
I
had
n't
*NL*
need
keep

out
any

*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
buildings
round
the
yard
shut
out
a
good
deal
of
the
sky
,
*NL*
but
the
large
window
let
in
abundant
light
to
show
every
corner
of
the
*NL*
house-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
seated
in
the
rocking-chair
,
which
had
been
brought
out
of
*NL*
the
``
right-hand
parlour
,
''
was
trying
to
soothe
Totty
to
sleep
.
But
Totty
*NL*
was
not
disposed
to
sleep
;
and
when
her
cousins
entered
,
she
raised
*NL*
herself
up
and
showed
a
pair
of
flushed
cheeks
,
which
looked
fatter
than
*NL*
ever
now
they
were
defined
by
the
edge
of
her
linen
night-cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
large
wicker-bottomed
arm-chair
in
the
left-hand
chimney-nook
sat
*NL*
old
Martin
Poyser
,
a
hale
but
shrunken
and
bleached
image
of
his
portly
*NL*
black-haired
son
--
his
head
hanging
forward
a
little
,
and
his
elbows
*NL*
pushed
backwards
so
as
to
allow
the
whole
of
his
forearm
to
rest
on
the
*NL*
arm
of
the
chair
.
His
blue
handkerchief
was
spread
over
his
knees
,
as
*NL*
was
usual
indoors
,
when
it
was
not
hanging
over
his
head
;
and
he
sat
*NL*
watching
what
went
forward
with
the
quiet
OUTWARD
glance
of
healthy
old
*NL*
age
,
which
,
disengaged
from
any
interest
in
an
inward
drama
,
spies
out
*NL*
pins
upon
the
floor
,
follows
one
's
minutest
motions
with
an
unexpectant
*NL*
purposeless
tenacity
,
watches
the
flickering
of
the
flame
or
the
*NL*
sun-gleams
on
the
wall
,
counts
the
quarries
on
the
floor
,
watches
even
*NL*
the
hand
of
the
clock
,
and
pleases
itself
with
detecting
a
rhythm
in
the
*NL*
tick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
time
o
'
night
this
is
to
come
home
,
Hetty
!
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
clock
,
do
;
why
,
it
's
going
on
for
half-past
nine
,
and
I
've
*NL*
sent
the
gells
to
bed
this
half-hour
,
and
late
enough
too
;
when
they
've
*NL*
got
to
get
up
at
half
after
four
,
and
the
mowers

bottles
to
fill
,
and
*NL*
the
baking
;
and
here
's
this
blessed
child
wi

the
fever
for
what
I
know

and
as
wakeful
as
if
it
was
dinner-time

and
nobody

your

there

's
anything
to
be

done

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
set
out
before
eight
,
aunt
,
''
said
Hetty
,
in
a
pettish
tone
,
with
*NL*
a
slight
toss
of
her
head
.
``
But
this
clock
's
so
much
before
the
clock
at
*NL*
the
Chase

there
's
no
telling

it
'll
be
when
I
get
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

You

be

The

been
put
forrard
for
the
first
*NL*
time
to-day
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
was
,
Hetty
had
really
forgotten
the
difference
of
the
clocks
*NL*
when
she
told
Captain
Donnithorne
that
she
set
out
at
eight
,
and
this
,
*NL*
with
her
lingering
pace
,
had
made
her
nearly
half
an
hour
later
than
*NL*
usual
.
But
here
her
aunt
's
attention
was
diverted
from
this
tender
*NL*
subject
by
Totty
,
who
,
perceiving
at
length
that
the
arrival
of
*NL*
her
cousins
was
not
likely
to
bring
anything
satisfactory
to
her
in
*NL*
particular
,
began
to
cry
,
``
Munny
,
munny
,
''
in
an
explosive
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
my
pet
,
Mother
's
got
her
,
Mother
wo
n't
leave
her
;
Totty
be
*NL*
a
good
dilling
,
and
go
to
sleep
now
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
leaning
back
and
*NL*
rocking
the
chair
,
while
she
tried
to
make
Totty
nestle
against
her
.
*NL*
But
Totty
only
cried
louder
,
and
said
,
``
Do
n't
yock
!
''
So
the
mother
,
with
*NL*
that
wondrous
patience
which
love
gives
to
the
quickest
temperament
,
sat
*NL*
up
again
,
and
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
linen
night-cap
and
kissed
*NL*
it
,
and
forgot
to
scold
Hetty
any
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Hetty
,
''
said
Martin
Poyser
,
in
a
conciliatory
tone
,
``
go

get

your

*NL*

Dinah
;

*NL*
*NL*
``

taking
off

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
complied
silently
by
going
towards
the
pantry
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
went
on
speaking
to
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down

you
stayed
so
long

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seemed

her

women
about

commonly

I
thought
just
at

she
was
almost
angry

me
for
going

*NL*
``
Eh

look-out
when

said
old
Martin
,
bending
his
head
down
lower
,
and
seeming
to
trace
*NL*
the
pattern
of
the
quarries
with
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

it
's
ill
livin

in

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
Hetty
now
came
back
from
the
pantry
and
said
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
as
his

seemed
to
hesitate

seeing

that
Totty
was
at
last
nestling
quietly

``

*NL*
``
Well

said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
went
close
to
the
rocking-chair
,
and
stood
without
her
usual
*NL*
smile
,
and
without
any
attempt
to
entice
Totty
,
simply
waiting
for
her
*NL*
aunt
to
give
the
child
into
her
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Before
her
mother
had
done
speaking
,
Totty
had
given
her
answer
in
*NL*
an
unmistakable
manner
,
by
knitting
her
brow
,
setting
her
tiny
teeth
*NL*
against
her
underlip
,
and
leaning
forward
to
slap
Hetty
on
the
arm
with
*NL*
her
utmost
force

Then
,
without
speaking
,
she
nestled
to
her
mother
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey

hey

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
while
Hetty
stood
without
moving
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
,
having
taken
off
her
bonnet

had
hitherto
kept
quietly
*NL*
seated
in
the
background
,
not
liking
to
thrust
herself
between
Hetty
and
*NL*
what
was
considered
Hetty
's
proper
work
.
But
now
she
came
forward
,
and
,
*NL*
putting
out
her
arms
,
said
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
Totty
turned
her
face
towards
Dinah

looked
at
her
an
instant
,
then
*NL*
lifted
herself
up
,
put
out
her
little
arms

and
let
Dinah
lift
her
from
*NL*
her
mother

lap

Hetty
turned
away
without
any
sign
of
ill
humour
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
her
hat
from
the
table
,
stood
waiting
with
an
air
of
*NL*
indifference

to
see
if
she
should
be
told
to
do
anything

*NL*
``

Mrs.

rising
with
an
appearance

relief
from

her
low

The
heavy
wooden
bolts
began
to
roll
in

doors

old

prepared
to
move

by
gathering
up
his

reaching

his
bright
knobbed
walnut-tree

from

Mrs.

then
*NL*
led
the
way
out

followed
by
the

on
her
way
,
peeped
into
the
room
where
her
two
boys
lay
;
*NL*
just
to
see
their
ruddy
round
cheeks
on
the
pillow
,
and
to
hear
for
a
*NL*
moment
their
light
regular
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Hetty
,
get
to
bed

''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
in
a
soothing
tone
,
as
*NL*
he
himself
turned
to
go
upstairs
.
``
You
didna
mean
to
be
late

I
'll
*NL*
be
bound

Chapter
XV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Two
Bed-Chambers
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HETTY
and
Dinah
both
slept
in
the
second
story
,
in
rooms
adjoining
each
*NL*
other
,
meagrely
furnished
rooms
,
with
no
blinds
to
shut
out
the
light
,
*NL*
which
was
now
beginning
to
gather
new
strength
from
the
rising
of
*NL*
the
moon
--
more
than
enough
strength
to
enable
Hetty
to
move
about
and
*NL*
undress
with
perfect
comfort
.
She
could
see
quite
well
the
pegs
in
the
*NL*
old
painted
linen-press
on
which
she
hung
her
hat
and
gown
;
she
could
*NL*
see
the
head
of
every
pin
on
her
red
cloth
pin-cushion
;
she
could
see
*NL*
a
reflection
of
herself
in
the
old-fashioned
looking-glass
,
quite
as
*NL*
distinct
as
was
needful
,
considering
that
she
had
only
to
brush
her
hair
*NL*
and
put
on
her
night-cap
.
A
queer
old
looking-glass
!
Hetty
got
into
an
*NL*
ill
temper
with
it
almost
every
time
she
dressed
.
It
had
been
considered
*NL*
a
handsome
glass
in
its
day
,
and
had
probably
been
bought
into
the
*NL*
Poyser
family
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
,
at
a
sale
of
genteel
*NL*
household
furniture
.
Even
now
an
auctioneer
could
say
something
for
*NL*
it
:
it
had
a
great
deal
of
tarnished
gilding
about
it
;
it
had
a
firm
*NL*
mahogany
base
,
well
supplied
with
drawers
,
which
opened
with
a
decided
*NL*
jerk
and
sent
the
contents
leaping
out
from
the
farthest
corners
,
*NL*
without
giving
you
the
trouble
of
reaching
them
;
above
all
,
it
had
a
*NL*
brass
candle-socket
on
each
side
,
which
would
give
it
an
aristocratic
*NL*
air
to
the
very
last
.
But
Hetty
objected
to
it
because
it
had
numerous
*NL*
dim
blotches
sprinkled
over
the
mirror
,
which
no
rubbing
would
remove
,
*NL*
and
because
,
instead
of
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
,
it
was
fixed
*NL*
in
an
upright
position
,
so
that
she
could
only
get
one
good
view
of
*NL*
her
head
and
neck
,
and
that
was
to
be
had
only
by
sitting
down
on
a
*NL*
low
chair
before
her
dressing-table
.
And
the
dressing-table
was
no
*NL*
dressing-table
at
all
,
but
a
small
old
chest
of
drawers
,
the
most
*NL*
awkward
thing
in
the
world
to
sit
down
before
,
for
the
big
brass
*NL*
handles
quite
hurt
her
knees
,
and
she
could
n't
get
near
the
glass
at
*NL*
all
comfortably
.
But
devout
worshippers
never
allow
inconveniences
*NL*
to
prevent
them
from
performing
their
religious
rites
,
and
Hetty
this
*NL*
evening
was
more
bent
on
her
peculiar
form
of
worship
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
taken
off
her
gown
and
white
kerchief
,
she
drew
a
key
from
the
*NL*
large
pocket
that
hung
outside
her
petticoat
,
and
,
unlocking
one
of
*NL*
the
lower
drawers
in
the
chest
,
reached
from
it
two
short
bits
of
wax
*NL*
candle
--
secretly
bought
at
Treddleston
--
and
stuck
them
in
the
two
*NL*
brass
sockets
.
Then
she
drew
forth
a
bundle
of
matches
and
lighted
the
*NL*
candles
;
and
last
of
all
,
a
small
red-framed
shilling
looking-glass
,
*NL*
without
blotches
.
It
was
into
this
small
glass
that
she
chose
to
look
*NL*
first
after
seating
herself
.
She
looked
into
it
,
smiling
and
turning
her
*NL*
head
on
one
side
,
for
a
minute
,
then
laid
it
down
and
took
out
her
brush
*NL*
and
comb
from
an
upper
drawer
.
She
was
going
to
let
down
her
hair
,
*NL*
and
make
herself
look
like
that
picture
of
a
lady
in
Miss
Lydia
*NL*
Donnithorne
's
dressing-room
.
It
was
soon
done
,
and
the
dark
hyacinthine
*NL*
curves
fell
on
her
neck
.
It
was
not
heavy
,
massive
,
merely
rippling
*NL*
hair
,
but
soft
and
silken
,
running
at
every
opportunity
into
delicate
*NL*
rings
.
But
she
pushed
it
all
backward
to
look
like
the
picture
,
and
form
*NL*
a
dark
curtain
,
throwing
into
relief
her
round
white
neck
.
Then
she
put
*NL*
down
her
brush
and
comb
and
looked
at
herself
,
folding
her
arms
before
*NL*
her
,
still
like
the
picture
.
Even
the
old
mottled
glass
could
n't
help
*NL*
sending
back
a
lovely
image
,
none
the
less
lovely
because
Hetty
's
stays
*NL*
were
not
of
white
satin
--
such
as
I
feel
sure
heroines
must
generally
*NL*
wear
--
but
of
a
dark
greenish
cotton
texture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
yes
!
She
was
very
pretty
.
Captain
Donnithorne
thought
so
.
Prettier
*NL*
than
anybody
about
Hayslope
--
prettier
than
any
of
the
ladies
she
had
*NL*
ever
seen
visiting
at
the
Chase
--
indeed
it
seemed
fine
ladies
were
*NL*
rather
old
and
ugly
--
and
prettier
than
Miss
Bacon
,
the
miller
's
*NL*
daughter
,
who
was
called
the
beauty
of
Treddleston
.
And
Hetty
looked
at
*NL*
herself
to-night
with
quite
a
different
sensation
from
what
she
had
ever
*NL*
felt
before
;
there
was
an
invisible
spectator
whose
eye
rested
on
her
*NL*
like
morning
on
the
flowers
.
His
soft
voice
was
saying
over
and
over
*NL*
again
those
pretty
things
she
had
heard
in
the
wood
;
his
arm
was
round
*NL*
her
,
and
the
delicate
rose-scent
of
his
hair
was
with
her
still
.
The
*NL*
vainest
woman
is
never
thoroughly
conscious
of
her
own
beauty
till
she
*NL*
is
loved
by
the
man
who
sets
her
own
passion
vibrating
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hetty
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
that
something
was
wanting
,
*NL*
for
she
got
up
and
reached
an
old
black
lace
scarf
out
of
the
*NL*
linen-press
,
and
a
pair
of
large
ear-rings
out
of
the
sacred
drawer
from
*NL*
which
she
had
taken
her
candles
.
It
was
an
old
old
scarf
,
full
of
rents
,
*NL*
but
it
would
make
a
becoming
border
round
her
shoulders
,
and
set
off
the
*NL*
whiteness
of
her
upper
arm
.
And
she
would
take
out
the
little
ear-rings
*NL*
she
had
in
her
ears
--
oh
,
how
her
aunt
had
scolded
her
for
having
her
*NL*
ears
bored
!
--
and
put
in
those
large
ones
.
They
were
but
coloured
glass
*NL*
and
gilding
,
but
if
you
did
n't
know
what
they
were
made
of
,
they
looked
*NL*
just
as
well
as
what
the
ladies
wore
.
And
so
she
sat
down
again
,
with
*NL*
the
large
ear-rings
in
her
ears
,
and
the
black
lace
scarf
adjusted
round
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
She
looked
down
at
her
arms
:
no
arms
could
be
prettier
*NL*
down
to
a
little
way
below
the
elbow
--
they
were
white
and
plump
,
and
*NL*
dimpled
to
match
her
cheeks
;
but
towards
the
wrist
,
she
thought
with
*NL*
vexation
that
they
were
coarsened
by
butter-making
and
other
work
that
*NL*
ladies
never
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Donnithorne
could
n't
like
her
to
go
on
doing
work
:
he
would
like
*NL*
to
see
her
in
nice
clothes
,
and
thin
shoes
,
and
white
stockings
,
perhaps
*NL*
with
silk
clocks
to
them
;
for
he
must
love
her
very
much
--
no
one
else
*NL*
had
ever
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
in
that
way
.
He
would
want
*NL*
to
marry
her
and
make
a
lady
of
her
;
she
could
hardly
dare
to
shape
*NL*
the
thought
--
yet
how
else
could
it
be
?
Marry
her
quite
secretly
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
James
,
the
doctor
's
assistant
,
married
the
doctor
's
niece
,
and
nobody
*NL*
ever
found
it
out
for
a
long
while
after
,
and
then
it
was
of
no
use
to
*NL*
be
angry
.
The
doctor
had
told
her
aunt
all
about
it
in
Hetty
's
hearing
.
*NL*
She
did
n't
know
how
it
would
be
,
but
it
was
quite
plain
the
old
Squire
*NL*
could
never
be
told
anything
about
it
,
for
Hetty
was
ready
to
faint
with
*NL*
awe
and
fright
if
she
came
across
him
at
the
Chase
.
He
might
have
been
*NL*
earth-born
,
for
what
she
knew
.
It
had
never
entered
her
mind
that
he
*NL*
had
been
young
like
other
men
;
he
had
always
been
the
old
Squire
at
whom
*NL*
everybody
was
frightened
.
Oh
,
it
was
impossible
to
think
how
it
would
*NL*
be
!
But
Captain
Donnithorne
would
know
;
he
was
a
great
gentleman
,
and
*NL*
could
have
his
way
in
everything
,
and
could
buy
everything
he
liked
.
And
*NL*
nothing
could
be
as
it
had
been
again
:
perhaps
some
day
she
should
be
*NL*
a
grand
lady
,
and
ride
in
her
coach
,
and
dress
for
dinner
in
a
brocaded
*NL*
silk
,
with
feathers
in
her
hair
,
and
her
dress
sweeping
the
ground
,
like
*NL*
Miss
Lydia
and
Lady
Dacey
,
when
she
saw
them
going
into
the
dining-room
*NL*
one
evening
as
she
peeped
through
the
little
round
window
in
the
lobby
;
*NL*
only
she
should
not
be
old
and
ugly
like
Miss
Lydia
,
or
all
the
same
*NL*
thickness
like
Lady
Dacey
,
but
very
pretty
,
with
her
hair
done
in
a
*NL*
great
many
different
ways
,
and
sometimes
in
a
pink
dress
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
in
a
white
one
--
she
did
n't
know
which
she
liked
best
;
and
Mary
Burge
and
*NL*
everybody
would
perhaps
see
her
going
out
in
her
carriage
--
or
rather
,
*NL*
they
would
HEAR
of
it
:
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
these
things
*NL*
happening
at
Hayslope
in
sight
of
her
aunt
.
At
the
thought
of
all
this
*NL*
splendour
,
Hetty
got
up
from
her
chair
,
and
in
doing
so
caught
the
*NL*
little
red-framed
glass
with
the
edge
of
her
scarf
,
so
that
it
fell
with
*NL*
a
bang
on
the
floor
;
but
she
was
too
eagerly
occupied
with
her
vision
*NL*
to
care
about
picking
it
up
;
and
after
a
momentary
start
,
began
to
pace
*NL*
with
a
pigeon-like
stateliness
backwards
and
forwards
along
her
room
,
*NL*
in
her
coloured
stays
and
coloured
skirt
,
and
the
old
black
lace
scarf
*NL*
round
her
shoulders
,
and
the
great
glass
ear-rings
in
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
pretty
the
little
puss
looks
in
that
odd
dress
!
It
would
be
the
*NL*
easiest
folly
in
the
world
to
fall
in
love
with
her
:
there
is
such
a
*NL*
sweet
babylike
roundness
about
her
face
and
figure
;
the
delicate
dark
*NL*
rings
of
hair
lie
so
charmingly
about
her
ears
and
neck
;
her
great
*NL*
dark
eyes
with
their
long
eye-lashes
touch
one
so
strangely
,
as
if
an
*NL*
imprisoned
frisky
sprite
looked
out
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
what
a
prize
the
man
gets
who
wins
a
sweet
bride
like
Hetty
!
How
the
*NL*
men
envy
him
who
come
to
the
wedding
breakfast
,
and
see
her
hanging
on
*NL*
his
arm
in
her
white
lace
and
orange
blossoms
.
The
dear
,
young
,
round
,
*NL*
soft
,
flexible
thing
!
Her
heart
must
be
just
as
soft
,
her
temper
just
*NL*
as
free
from
angles
,
her
character
just
as
pliant
.
If
anything
ever
goes
*NL*
wrong
,
it
must
be
the
husband
's
fault
there
:
he
can
make
her
what
he
*NL*
likes
--
that
is
plain
.
And
the
lover
himself
thinks
so
too
:
the
little
*NL*
darling
is
so
fond
of
him
,
her
little
vanities
are
so
bewitching
,
he
*NL*
would
n't
consent
to
her
being
a
bit
wiser
;
those
kittenlike
glances
and
*NL*
movements
are
just
what
one
wants
to
make
one
's
hearth
a
paradise
.
*NL*
Every
man
under
such
circumstances
is
conscious
of
being
a
great
*NL*
physiognomist
.
Nature
,
he
knows
,
has
a
language
of
her
own
,
which
she
*NL*
uses
with
strict
veracity
,
and
he
considers
himself
an
adept
in
the
*NL*
language
.
Nature
has
written
out
his
bride
's
character
for
him
in
those
*NL*
exquisite
lines
of
cheek
and
lip
and
chin
,
in
those
eyelids
delicate
as
*NL*
petals
,
in
those
long
lashes
curled
like
the
stamen
of
a
flower
,
in
the
*NL*
dark
liquid
depths
of
those
wonderful
eyes
.
How
she
will
dote
on
her
*NL*
children
!
She
is
almost
a
child
herself
,
and
the
little
pink
round
*NL*
things
will
hang
about
her
like
florets
round
the
central
flower
;
and
*NL*
the
husband
will
look
on
,
smiling
benignly
,
able
,
whenever
he
chooses
,
*NL*
to
withdraw
into
the
sanctuary
of
his
wisdom
,
towards
which
his
sweet
*NL*
wife
will
look
reverently
,
and
never
lift
the
curtain
.
It
is
a
marriage
*NL*
such
as
they
made
in
the
golden
age
,
when
the
men
were
all
wise
and
*NL*
majestic
and
the
women
all
lovely
and
loving
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
much
in
this
way
that
our
friend
Adam
Bede
thought
about
*NL*
Hetty
;
only
he
put
his
thoughts
into
different
words
.
If
ever
she
*NL*
behaved
with
cold
vanity
towards
him
,
he
said
to
himself
it
is
only
*NL*
because
she
does
n't
love
me
well
enough
;
and
he
was
sure
that
her
love
,
*NL*
whenever
she
gave
it
,
would
be
the
most
precious
thing
a
man
could
*NL*
possess
on
earth
.
Before
you
despise
Adam
as
deficient
in
penetration
,
*NL*
pray
ask
yourself
if
you
were
ever
predisposed
to
believe
evil
of
*NL*
any
pretty
woman
--
if
you
ever
COULD
,
without
hard
head-breaking
*NL*
demonstration
,
believe
evil
of
the
ONE
supremely
pretty
woman
who
has
*NL*
bewitched
you
.
No
:
people
who
love
downy
peaches
are
apt
not
to
think
of
*NL*
the
stone
,
and
sometimes
jar
their
teeth
terribly
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
too
,
had
the
same
sort
of
notion
about
Hetty
,
so
*NL*
far
as
he
had
thought
of
her
nature
of
all
.
He
felt
sure
she
was
a
*NL*
dear
,
affectionate
,
good
little
thing
.
The
man
who
awakes
the
wondering
*NL*
tremulous
passion
of
a
young
girl
always
thinks
her
affectionate
;
and
*NL*
if
he
chances
to
look
forward
to
future
years
,
probably
imagines
himself
*NL*
being
virtuously
tender
to
her
,
because
the
poor
thing
is
so
clingingly
*NL*
fond
of
him
.
God
made
these
dear
women
so
--
and
it
is
a
convenient
*NL*
arrangement
in
case
of
sickness
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
I
believe
the
wisest
of
us
must
be
beguiled
in
this
way
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
must
think
both
better
and
worse
of
people
than
they
*NL*
deserve
.
Nature
has
her
language
,
and
she
is
not
unveracious
;
but
we
*NL*
do
n't
know
all
the
intricacies
of
her
syntax
just
yet
,
and
in
a
hasty
*NL*
reading
we
may
happen
to
extract
the
very
opposite
of
her
real
meaning
.
*NL*
Long
dark
eyelashes
,
now
--
what
can
be
more
exquisite
?
I
find
it
*NL*
impossible
not
to
expect
some
depth
of
soul
behind
a
deep
grey
eye
with
*NL*
a
long
dark
eyelash
,
in
spite
of
an
experience
which
has
shown
me
that
*NL*
they
may
go
along
with
deceit
,
peculation
,
and
stupidity
.
But
if
,
in
*NL*
the
reaction
of
disgust
,
I
have
betaken
myself
to
a
fishy
eye
,
there
has
*NL*
been
a
surprising
similarity
of
result
.
One
begins
to
suspect
at
length
*NL*
that
there
is
no
direct
correlation
between
eyelashes
and
morals
;
or
*NL*
else
,
that
the
eyelashes
express
the
disposition
of
the
fair
one
's
*NL*
grandmother
,
which
is
on
the
whole
less
important
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
eyelashes
could
be
more
beautiful
than
Hetty
's
;
and
now
,
while
she
*NL*
walks
with
her
pigeon-like
stateliness
along
the
room
and
looks
down
on
*NL*
her
shoulders
bordered
by
the
old
black
lace
,
the
dark
fringe
shows
to
*NL*
perfection
on
her
pink
cheek
.
They
are
but
dim
ill-defined
pictures
that
*NL*
her
narrow
bit
of
an
imagination
can
make
of
the
future
;
but
of
every
*NL*
picture
she
is
the
central
figure
in
fine
clothes
;
Captain
Donnithorne
*NL*
is
very
close
to
her
,
putting
his
arm
round
her
,
perhaps
kissing
her
,
*NL*
and
everybody
else
is
admiring
and
envying
her
--
especially
Mary
Burge
,
*NL*
whose
new
print
dress
looks
very
contemptible
by
the
side
of
Hetty
's
*NL*
resplendent
toilette
.
Does
any
sweet
or
sad
memory
mingle
with
this
*NL*
dream
of
the
future
--
any
loving
thought
of
her
second
parents
--
of
the
*NL*
children
she
had
helped
to
tend
--
of
any
youthful
companion
,
any
pet
*NL*
animal
,
any
relic
of
her
own
childhood
even
?
Not
one
.
There
are
some
*NL*
plants
that
have
hardly
any
roots
:
you
may
tear
them
from
their
native
*NL*
nook
of
rock
or
wall
,
and
just
lay
them
over
your
ornamental
flower-pot
,
*NL*
and
they
blossom
none
the
worse
.
Hetty
could
have
cast
all
her
past
life
*NL*
behind
her
and
never
cared
to
be
reminded
of
it
again
.
I
think
she
had
*NL*
no
feeling
at
all
towards
the
old
house
,
and
did
not
like
the
Jacob
's
*NL*
Ladder
and
the
long
row
of
hollyhocks
in
the
garden
better
than
other
*NL*
flowers
--
perhaps
not
so
well
.
It
was
wonderful
how
little
she
seemed
to
*NL*
care
about
waiting
on
her
uncle
,
who
had
been
a
good
father
to
her
--
she
*NL*
hardly
ever
remembered
to
reach
him
his
pipe
at
the
right
time
without
*NL*
being
told
,
unless
a
visitor
happened
to
be
there
,
who
would
have
a
*NL*
better
opportunity
of
seeing
her
as
she
walked
across
the
hearth
.
Hetty
*NL*
did
not
understand
how
anybody
could
be
very
fond
of
middle-aged
people
.
*NL*
And
as
for
those
tiresome
children
,
Marty
and
Tommy
and
Totty
,
they
had
*NL*
been
the
very
nuisance
of
her
life
--
as
bad
as
buzzing
insects
that
will
*NL*
come
teasing
you
on
a
hot
day
when
you
want
to
be
quiet
.
Marty
,
the
*NL*
eldest
,
was
a
baby
when
she
first
came
to
the
farm
,
for
the
children
*NL*
born
before
him
had
died
,
and
so
Hetty
had
had
them
all
three
,
one
after
*NL*
the
other
,
toddling
by
her
side
in
the
meadow
,
or
playing
about
her
on
*NL*
wet
days
in
the
half-empty
rooms
of
the
large
old
house
.
The
boys
were
*NL*
out
of
hand
now
,
but
Totty
was
still
a
day-long
plague
,
worse
than
*NL*
either
of
the
others
had
been
,
because
there
was
more
fuss
made
about
*NL*
her
.
And
there
was
no
end
to
the
making
and
mending
of
clothes
.
Hetty
*NL*
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
that
she
should
never
see
a
child
again
;
*NL*
they
were
worse
than
the
nasty
little
lambs
that
the
shepherd
was
always
*NL*
bringing
in
to
be
taken
special
care
of
in
lambing
time
;
for
the
lambs
*NL*
WERE
got
rid
of
sooner
or
later
.
As
for
the
young
chickens
and
turkeys
,
*NL*
Hetty
would
have
hated
the
very
word
``
hatching
,
''
if
her
aunt
had
not
*NL*
bribed
her
to
attend
to
the
young
poultry
by
promising
her
the
proceeds
*NL*
of
one
out
of
every
brood
.
The
round
downy
chicks
peeping
out
from
under
*NL*
their
mother
's
wing
never
touched
Hetty
with
any
pleasure
;
that
was
*NL*
not
the
sort
of
prettiness
she
cared
about
,
but
she
did
care
about
the
*NL*
prettiness
of
the
new
things
she
would
buy
for
herself
at
Treddleston
*NL*
Fair
with
the
money
they
fetched
.
And
yet
she
looked
so
dimpled
,
*NL*
so
charming
,
as
she
stooped
down
to
put
the
soaked
bread
under
the
*NL*
hen-coop
,
that
you
must
have
been
a
very
acute
personage
indeed
to
*NL*
suspect
her
of
that
hardness
.
Molly
,
the
housemaid
,
with
a
turn-up
nose
*NL*
and
a
protuberant
jaw
,
was
really
a
tender-hearted
girl
,
and
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
said
,
a
jewel
to
look
after
the
poultry
;
but
her
stolid
*NL*
face
showed
nothing
of
this
maternal
delight
,
any
more
than
a
brown
*NL*
earthenware
pitcher
will
show
the
light
of
the
lamp
within
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
generally
a
feminine
eye
that
first
detects
the
moral
deficiencies
*NL*
hidden
under
the
``
dear
deceit
''
of
beauty
,
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
with
her
keenness
and
abundant
opportunity
for
observation
,
*NL*
should
have
formed
a
tolerably
fair
estimate
of
what
might
be
expected
*NL*
from
Hetty
in
the
way
of
feeling
,
and
in
moments
of
indignation
she
had
*NL*
sometimes
spoken
with
great
openness
on
the
subject
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
no
better
than
a
peacock
,
as
`
ud
strut
about
on
the
wall
and
*NL*
spread
its
tail
when
the
sun
shone
if
all
the
folks
i
'
the
parish
was
*NL*
dying
:
there
's
nothing
seems
to
give
her
a
turn
i
'
th
'
inside
,
not
even
*NL*
when
we
thought
Totty
had
tumbled
into
the
pit
.
To
think
o
'
that
dear
*NL*
cherub
!
And
we
found
her
wi
'
her
little
shoes
stuck
i
'
the
mud
an
'
*NL*
crying
fit
to
break
her
heart
by
the
far
horse-pit
.
But
Hetty
never
*NL*
minded
it
,
I
could
see
,
though
she
's
been
at
the
nussin
'
o
'
the
child
*NL*
ever
since
it
was
a
babby
.
It
's
my
belief
her
heart
's
as
hard
as
a
*NL*
pebble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
``
thee
must
n't
judge
Hetty
too
hard
.
Them
*NL*
young
gells
are
like
the
unripe
grain
;
they
'll
make
good
meal
by
and
by
,
*NL*
but
they
're
squashy
as
yet
.
Thee
'
t
see
Hetty
'll
be
all
right
when
she
's
*NL*
got
a
good
husband
and
children
of
her
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
hard
upo
'
the
gell
.
She
's
got
cliver
fingers
of
her
*NL*
own
,
and
can
be
useful
enough
when
she
likes
and
I
should
miss
her
wi
'
*NL*
the
butter
,
for
she
's
got
a
cool
hand
.
An
'
let
be
what
may
,
I
'd
strive
*NL*
to
do
my
part
by
a
niece
o
'
yours
--
an
'
THAT
I
've
done
,
for
I
've
taught
*NL*
her
everything
as
belongs
to
a
house
,
an
'
I
've
told
her
her
duty
often
*NL*
enough
,
though
,
God
knows
,
I
've
no
breath
to
spare
,
an
'
that
catchin
'
*NL*
pain
comes
on
dreadful
by
times
.
Wi
'
them
three
gells
in
the
house
I
'd
*NL*
need
have
twice
the
strength
to
keep
'em
up
to
their
work
.
It
's
*NL*
like
having
roast
meat
at
three
fires
;
as
soon
as
you
've
basted
one
,
*NL*
another
's
burnin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
stood
sufficiently
in
awe
of
her
aunt
to
be
anxious
to
conceal
*NL*
from
her
so
much
of
her
vanity
as
could
be
hidden
without
too
great
a
*NL*
sacrifice
.
She
could
not
resist
spending
her
money
in
bits
of
finery
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Poyser
disapproved
;
but
she
would
have
been
ready
to
die
with
*NL*
shame
,
vexation
,
and
fright
if
her
aunt
had
this
moment
opened
the
door
,
*NL*
and
seen
her
with
her
bits
of
candle
lighted
,
and
strutting
about
decked
*NL*
in
her
scarf
and
ear-rings
.
To
prevent
such
a
surprise
,
she
always
*NL*
bolted
her
door
,
and
she
had
not
forgotten
to
do
so
to-night
.
It
was
*NL*
well
:
for
there
now
came
a
light
tap
,
and
Hetty
,
with
a
leaping
heart
,
*NL*
rushed
to
blow
out
the
candles
and
throw
them
into
the
drawer
.
She
dared
*NL*
not
stay
to
take
out
her
ear-rings
,
but
she
threw
off
her
scarf
,
and
let
*NL*
it
fall
on
the
floor
,
before
the
light
tap
came
again
.
We
shall
know
how
*NL*
it
was
that
the
light
tap
came
,
if
we
leave
Hetty
for
a
short
time
*NL*
and
return
to
Dinah
,
at
the
moment
when
she
had
delivered
Totty
to
her
*NL*
mother
's
arms
,
and
was
come
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
,
adjoining
Hetty
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
delighted
in
her
bedroom
window
.
Being
on
the
second
story
of
that
*NL*
tall
house
,
it
gave
her
a
wide
view
over
the
fields
.
The
thickness
of
*NL*
the
wall
formed
a
broad
step
about
a
yard
below
the
window
,
where
she
*NL*
could
place
her
chair
.
And
now
the
first
thing
she
did
on
entering
her
*NL*
room
was
to
seat
herself
in
this
chair
and
look
out
on
the
peaceful
*NL*
fields
beyond
which
the
large
moon
was
rising
,
just
above
the
hedgerow
*NL*
elms
.
She
liked
the
pasture
best
where
the
milch
cows
were
lying
,
*NL*
and
next
to
that
the
meadow
where
the
grass
was
half-mown
,
and
lay
in
*NL*
silvered
sweeping
lines
.
Her
heart
was
very
full
,
for
there
was
to
be
*NL*
only
one
more
night
on
which
she
would
look
out
on
those
fields
for
a
*NL*
long
time
to
come
;
but
she
thought
little
of
leaving
the
mere
scene
,
*NL*
for
,
to
her
,
bleak
Snowfield
had
just
as
many
charms
.
She
thought
of
all
*NL*
the
dear
people
whom
she
had
learned
to
care
for
among
these
peaceful
*NL*
fields
,
and
who
would
now
have
a
place
in
her
loving
remembrance
for
*NL*
ever
.
She
thought
of
the
struggles
and
the
weariness
that
might
lie
*NL*
before
them
in
the
rest
of
their
life
's
journey
,
when
she
would
be
away
*NL*
from
them
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
was
befalling
them
;
and
the
pressure
*NL*
of
this
thought
soon
became
too
strong
for
her
to
enjoy
the
unresponding
*NL*
stillness
of
the
moonlit
fields
.
She
closed
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
*NL*
feel
more
intensely
the
presence
of
a
Love
and
Sympathy
deeper
and
more
*NL*
tender
than
was
breathed
from
the
earth
and
sky
.
That
was
often
Dinah
's
*NL*
mode
of
praying
in
solitude
.
Simply
to
close
her
eyes
and
to
feel
*NL*
herself
enclosed
by
the
Divine
Presence
;
then
gradually
her
fears
,
her
*NL*
yearning
anxieties
for
others
,
melted
away
like
ice-crystals
in
a
warm
*NL*
ocean
.
She
had
sat
in
this
way
perfectly
still
,
with
her
hands
crossed
*NL*
on
her
lap
and
the
pale
light
resting
on
her
calm
face
,
for
at
least
ten
*NL*
minutes
when
she
was
startled
by
a
loud
sound
,
apparently
of
something
*NL*
falling
in
Hetty
's
room
.
But
like
all
sounds
that
fall
on
our
ears
in
a
*NL*
state
of
abstraction
,
it
had
no
distinct
character
,
but
was
simply
loud
*NL*
and
startling
,
so
that
she
felt
uncertain
whether
she
had
interpreted
*NL*
it
rightly
.
She
rose
and
listened
,
but
all
was
quiet
afterwards
,
and
she
*NL*
reflected
that
Hetty
might
merely
have
knocked
something
down
in
getting
*NL*
into
bed
.
She
began
slowly
to
undress
;
but
now
,
owing
to
the
suggestions
*NL*
of
this
sound
,
her
thoughts
became
concentrated
on
Hetty
--
that
sweet
*NL*
young
thing
,
with
life
and
all
its
trials
before
her
--
the
solemn
daily
*NL*
duties
of
the
wife
and
mother
--
and
her
mind
so
unprepared
for
them
all
,
*NL*
bent
merely
on
little
foolish
,
selfish
pleasures
,
like
a
child
hugging
*NL*
its
toys
in
the
beginning
of
a
long
toilsome
journey
in
which
it
will
*NL*
have
to
bear
hunger
and
cold
and
unsheltered
darkness
.
Dinah
felt
a
*NL*
double
care
for
Hetty
,
because
she
shared
Seth
's
anxious
interest
in
his
*NL*
brother
's
lot
,
and
she
had
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Hetty
did
not
*NL*
love
Adam
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
She
saw
too
clearly
the
absence
of
*NL*
any
warm
,
self-devoting
love
in
Hetty
's
nature
to
regard
the
coldness
of
*NL*
her
behaviour
towards
Adam
as
any
indication
that
he
was
not
the
man
*NL*
she
would
like
to
have
for
a
husband
.
And
this
blank
in
Hetty
's
nature
,
*NL*
instead
of
exciting
Dinah
's
dislike
,
only
touched
her
with
a
deeper
*NL*
pity
:
the
lovely
face
and
form
affected
her
as
beauty
always
affects
a
*NL*
pure
and
tender
mind
,
free
from
selfish
jealousies
.
It
was
an
excellent
*NL*
divine
gift
,
that
gave
a
deeper
pathos
to
the
need
,
the
sin
,
the
sorrow
*NL*
with
which
it
was
mingled
,
as
the
canker
in
a
lily-white
bud
is
more
*NL*
grievous
to
behold
than
in
a
common
pot-herb
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Dinah
had
undressed
and
put
on
her
night-gown
,
this
feeling
*NL*
about
Hetty
had
gathered
a
painful
intensity
;
her
imagination
had
*NL*
created
a
thorny
thicket
of
sin
and
sorrow
,
in
which
she
saw
the
poor
*NL*
thing
struggling
torn
and
bleeding
,
looking
with
tears
for
rescue
and
*NL*
finding
none
.
It
was
in
this
way
that
Dinah
's
imagination
and
sympathy
*NL*
acted
and
reacted
habitually
,
each
heightening
the
other
.
She
felt
a
*NL*
deep
longing
to
go
now
and
pour
into
Hetty
's
ear
all
the
words
of
tender
*NL*
warning
and
appeal
that
rushed
into
her
mind
.
But
perhaps
Hetty
was
*NL*
already
asleep
.
Dinah
put
her
ear
to
the
partition
and
heard
still
some
*NL*
slight
noises
,
which
convinced
her
that
Hetty
was
not
yet
in
bed
.
Still
*NL*
she
hesitated
;
she
was
not
quite
certain
of
a
divine
direction
;
the
*NL*
voice
that
told
her
to
go
to
Hetty
seemed
no
stronger
than
the
other
*NL*
voice
which
said
that
Hetty
was
weary
,
and
that
going
to
her
now
in
an
*NL*
unseasonable
moment
would
only
tend
to
close
her
heart
more
obstinately
.
*NL*
Dinah
was
not
satisfied
without
a
more
unmistakable
guidance
than
those
*NL*
inward
voices
.
There
was
light
enough
for
her
,
if
she
opened
her
Bible
,
*NL*
to
discern
the
text
sufficiently
to
know
what
it
would
say
to
her
.
She
*NL*
knew
the
physiognomy
of
every
page
,
and
could
tell
on
what
book
she
*NL*
opened
,
sometimes
on
what
chapter
,
without
seeing
title
or
number
.
It
*NL*
was
a
small
thick
Bible
,
worn
quite
round
at
the
edges
.
Dinah
laid
it
*NL*
sideways
on
the
window
ledge
,
where
the
light
was
strongest
,
and
then
*NL*
opened
it
with
her
forefinger
.
The
first
words
she
looked
at
were
those
*NL*
at
the
top
of
the
left-hand
page
:
``
And
they
all
wept
sore
,
and
fell
on
*NL*
Paul
's
neck
and
kissed
him
.
''
That
was
enough
for
Dinah
;
she
had
opened
*NL*
on
that
memorable
parting
at
Ephesus
,
when
Paul
had
felt
bound
to
open
*NL*
his
heart
in
a
last
exhortation
and
warning
.
She
hesitated
no
longer
,
*NL*
but
,
opening
her
own
door
gently
,
went
and
tapped
on
Hetty
's
.
We
know
*NL*
she
had
to
tap
twice
,
because
Hetty
had
to
put
out
her
candles
and
throw
*NL*
off
her
black
lace
scarf
;
but
after
the
second
tap
the
door
was
opened
*NL*
immediately
.
Dinah
said
,
``
Will
you
let
me
come
in
,
Hetty
?
''
and
Hetty
,
*NL*
without
speaking
,
for
she
was
confused
and
vexed
,
opened
the
door
wider
*NL*
and
let
her
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
strange
contrast
the
two
figures
made
,
visible
enough
in
that
*NL*
mingled
twilight
and
moonlight
!
Hetty
,
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
*NL*
glistening
from
her
imaginary
drama
,
her
beautiful
neck
and
arms
bare
,
*NL*
her
hair
hanging
in
a
curly
tangle
down
her
back
,
and
the
baubles
in
her
*NL*
ears
.
Dinah
,
covered
with
her
long
white
dress
,
her
pale
face
full
of
*NL*
subdued
emotion
,
almost
like
a
lovely
corpse
into
which
the
soul
has
*NL*
returned
charged
with
sublimer
secrets
and
a
sublimer
love
.
They
were
*NL*
nearly
of
the
same
height
;
Dinah
evidently
a
little
the
taller
as
she
*NL*
put
her
arm
round
Hetty
's
waist
and
kissed
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
were
not
in
bed
,
my
dear
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
sweet
clear
*NL*
voice
,
which
was
irritating
to
Hetty
,
mingling
with
her
own
peevish
*NL*
vexation
like
music
with
jangling
chains
,
``
for
I
heard
you
moving
;
and
I
*NL*
longed
to
speak
to
you
again
to-night
,
for
it
is
the
last
but
one
that
*NL*
I
shall
be
here
,
and
we
do
n't
know
what
may
happen
to-morrow
to
keep
us
*NL*
apart
.
Shall
I
sit
down
with
you
while
you
do
up
your
hair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Hetty
,
hastily
turning
round
and
reaching
the
second
*NL*
chair
in
the
room
,
glad
that
Dinah
looked
as
if
she
did
not
notice
her
*NL*
ear-rings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
sat
down
,
and
Hetty
began
to
brush
together
her
hair
before
*NL*
twisting
it
up
,
doing
it
with
that
air
of
excessive
indifference
which
*NL*
belongs
to
confused
self-consciousness
.
But
the
expression
of
Dinah
's
*NL*
eyes
gradually
relieved
her
;
they
seemed
unobservant
of
all
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Hetty
,
''
she
said
,
``
It
has
been
borne
in
upon
my
mind
to-night
that
*NL*
you
may
some
day
be
in
trouble
--
trouble
is
appointed
for
us
all
here
*NL*
below
,
and
there
comes
a
time
when
we
need
more
comfort
and
help
than
*NL*
the
things
of
this
life
can
give
.
I
want
to
tell
you
that
if
ever
you
*NL*
are
in
trouble
,
and
need
a
friend
that
will
always
feel
for
you
and
love
*NL*
you
,
you
have
got
that
friend
in
Dinah
Morris
at
Snowfield
,
and
if
you
*NL*
come
to
her
,
or
send
for
her
,
she
'll
never
forget
this
night
and
the
*NL*
words
she
is
speaking
to
you
now
.
Will
you
remember
it
,
Hetty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
,
rather
frightened
.
``
But
why
should
you
think
I
shall
*NL*
be
in
trouble
?
Do
you
know
of
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
had
seated
herself
as
she
tied
on
her
cap
,
and
now
Dinah
leaned
*NL*
forwards
and
took
her
hands
as
she
answered
,
``
Because
,
dear
,
trouble
*NL*
comes
to
us
all
in
this
life
:
we
set
our
hearts
on
things
which
it
is
n't
*NL*
God
's
will
for
us
to
have
,
and
then
we
go
sorrowing
;
the
people
we
love
*NL*
are
taken
from
us
,
and
we
can
joy
in
nothing
because
they
are
not
with
*NL*
us
;
sickness
comes
,
and
we
faint
under
the
burden
of
our
feeble
bodies
;
*NL*
we
go
astray
and
do
wrong
,
and
bring
ourselves
into
trouble
with
our
*NL*
fellow-men
.
There
is
no
man
or
woman
born
into
this
world
to
whom
some
*NL*
of
these
trials
do
not
fall
,
and
so
I
feel
that
some
of
them
must
happen
*NL*
to
you
;
and
I
desire
for
you
,
that
while
you
are
young
you
should
seek
*NL*
for
strength
from
your
Heavenly
Father
,
that
you
may
have
a
support
*NL*
which
will
not
fail
you
in
the
evil
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
paused
and
released
Hetty
's
hands
that
she
might
not
hinder
her
.
*NL*
Hetty
sat
quite
still
;
she
felt
no
response
within
herself
to
Dinah
's
*NL*
anxious
affection
;
but
Dinah
's
words
uttered
with
solemn
pathetic
*NL*
distinctness
,
affected
her
with
a
chill
fear
.
Her
flush
had
died
away
*NL*
almost
to
paleness
;
she
had
the
timidity
of
a
luxurious
pleasure-seeking
*NL*
nature
,
which
shrinks
from
the
hint
of
pain
.
Dinah
saw
the
effect
,
and
*NL*
her
tender
anxious
pleading
became
the
more
earnest
,
till
Hetty
,
full
of
*NL*
a
vague
fear
that
something
evil
was
some
time
to
befall
her
,
began
to
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
our
habit
to
say
that
while
the
lower
nature
can
never
understand
*NL*
the
higher
,
the
higher
nature
commands
a
complete
view
of
the
lower
.
But
*NL*
I
think
the
higher
nature
has
to
learn
this
comprehension
,
as
we
learn
*NL*
the
art
of
vision
,
by
a
good
deal
of
hard
experience
,
often
with
bruises
*NL*
and
gashes
incurred
in
taking
things
up
by
the
wrong
end
,
and
fancying
*NL*
our
space
wider
than
it
is
.
Dinah
had
never
seen
Hetty
affected
in
this
*NL*
way
before
,
and
,
with
her
usual
benignant
hopefulness
,
she
trusted
it
*NL*
was
the
stirring
of
a
divine
impulse
.
She
kissed
the
sobbing
thing
,
and
*NL*
began
to
cry
with
her
for
grateful
joy
.
But
Hetty
was
simply
in
that
*NL*
excitable
state
of
mind
in
which
there
is
no
calculating
what
turn
the
*NL*
feelings
may
take
from
one
moment
to
another
,
and
for
the
first
time
she
*NL*
became
irritated
under
Dinah
's
caress
.
She
pushed
her
away
impatiently
,
*NL*
and
said
,
with
a
childish
sobbing
voice
,
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
so
,
Dinah
.
*NL*
Why
do
you
come
to
frighten
me
?
I
've
never
done
anything
to
you
.
Why
*NL*
ca
n't
you
let
me
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Dinah
felt
a
pang
.
She
was
too
wise
to
persist
,
and
only
said
*NL*
mildly
,
``
Yes
,
my
dear
,
you
're
tired
;
I
wo
n't
hinder
you
any
longer
.
Make
*NL*
haste
and
get
into
bed
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
of
the
room
almost
as
quietly
and
quickly
as
if
she
had
*NL*
been
a
ghost
;
but
once
by
the
side
of
her
own
bed
,
she
threw
herself
on
*NL*
her
knees
and
poured
out
in
deep
silence
all
the
passionate
pity
that
*NL*
filled
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Hetty
,
she
was
soon
in
the
wood
again
--
her
waking
dreams
being
*NL*
merged
in
a
sleeping
life
scarcely
more
fragmentary
and
confused
.

ARTHUR
DONNITHORNE
,
you
remember
,
is
under
an
engagement
with
himself
to
*NL*
go
and
see
Mr.
Irwine
this
Friday
morning
,
and
he
is
awake
and
dressing
*NL*
so
early
that
he
determines
to
go
before
breakfast
,
instead
of
after
.
*NL*
The
rector
,
he
knows
,
breakfasts
alone
at
half-past
nine
,
the
ladies
of
*NL*
the
family
having
a
different
breakfast-hour
;
Arthur
will
have
an
early
*NL*
ride
over
the
hill
and
breakfast
with
him
.
One
can
say
everything
best
*NL*
over
a
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
progress
of
civilization
has
made
a
breakfast
or
a
dinner
an
*NL*
easy
and
cheerful
substitute
for
more
troublesome
and
disagreeable
*NL*
ceremonies
.
We
take
a
less
gloomy
view
of
our
errors
now
our
father
*NL*
confessor
listens
to
us
over
his
egg
and
coffee
.
We
are
more
distinctly
*NL*
conscious
that
rude
penances
are
out
of
the
question
for
gentlemen
in
*NL*
an
enlightened
age
,
and
that
mortal
sin
is
not
incompatible
with
an
*NL*
appetite
for
muffins
.
An
assault
on
our
pockets
,
which
in
more
barbarous
*NL*
times
would
have
been
made
in
the
brusque
form
of
a
pistol-shot
,
is
*NL*
quite
a
well-bred
and
smiling
procedure
now
it
has
become
a
request
for
*NL*
a
loan
thrown
in
as
an
easy
parenthesis
between
the
second
and
third
*NL*
glasses
of
claret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
there
was
this
advantage
in
the
old
rigid
forms
,
that
they
*NL*
committed
you
to
the
fulfilment
of
a
resolution
by
some
outward
deed
:
*NL*
when
you
have
put
your
mouth
to
one
end
of
a
hole
in
a
stone
wall
and
*NL*
are
aware
that
there
is
an
expectant
ear
at
the
other
end
,
you
are
more
*NL*
likely
to
say
what
you
came
out
with
the
intention
of
saying
than
if
you
*NL*
were
seated
with
your
legs
in
an
easy
attitude
under
the
mahogany
with
*NL*
a
companion
who
will
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
if
you
have
nothing
*NL*
particular
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
as
he
winds
among
the
pleasant
lanes
on
*NL*
horseback
in
the
morning
sunshine
,
has
a
sincere
determination
to
open
*NL*
his
heart
to
the
rector
,
and
the
swirling
sound
of
the
scythe
as
he
*NL*
passes
by
the
meadow
is
all
the
pleasanter
to
him
because
of
this
honest
*NL*
purpose
.
He
is
glad
to
see
the
promise
of
settled
weather
now
,
for
*NL*
getting
in
the
hay
,
about
which
the
farmers
have
been
fearful
;
and
there
*NL*
is
something
so
healthful
in
the
sharing
of
a
joy
that
is
general
and
*NL*
not
merely
personal
,
that
this
thought
about
the
hay-harvest
reacts
on
*NL*
his
state
of
mind
and
makes
his
resolution
seem
an
easier
matter
.
A
man
*NL*
about
town
might
perhaps
consider
that
these
influences
were
not
to
be
*NL*
felt
out
of
a
child
's
story-book
;
but
when
you
are
among
the
fields
*NL*
and
hedgerows
,
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
a
consistent
superiority
to
*NL*
simple
natural
pleasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
had
passed
the
village
of
Hayslope
and
was
approaching
the
*NL*
Broxton
side
of
the
hill
,
when
,
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
he
saw
a
*NL*
figure
about
a
hundred
yards
before
him
which
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
mistake
for
any
one
else
than
Adam
Bede
,
even
if
there
had
been
no
grey
,
*NL*
tailless
shepherd-dog
at
his
heels
.
He
was
striding
along
at
his
usual
*NL*
rapid
pace
,
and
Arthur
pushed
on
his
horse
to
overtake
him
,
for
he
*NL*
retained
too
much
of
his
boyish
feeling
for
Adam
to
miss
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
chatting
with
him
.
I
will
not
say
that
his
love
for
that
good
fellow
*NL*
did
not
owe
some
of
its
force
to
the
love
of
patronage
:
our
friend
*NL*
Arthur
liked
to
do
everything
that
was
handsome
,
and
to
have
his
*NL*
handsome
deeds
recognized
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
looked
round
as
he
heard
the
quickening
clatter
of
the
horse
's
*NL*
heels
,
and
waited
for
the
horseman
,
lifting
his
paper
cap
from
his
head
*NL*
with
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
.
Next
to
his
own
brother
Seth
,
Adam
*NL*
would
have
done
more
for
Arthur
Donnithorne
than
for
any
other
young
man
*NL*
in
the
world
.
There
was
hardly
anything
he
would
not
rather
have
lost
*NL*
than
the
two-feet
ruler
which
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
;
it
was
*NL*
Arthur
's
present
,
bought
with
his
pocket-money
when
he
was
a
fair-haired
*NL*
lad
of
eleven
,
and
when
he
had
profited
so
well
by
Adam
's
lessons
in
*NL*
carpentering
and
turning
as
to
embarrass
every
female
in
the
house
with
*NL*
gifts
of
superfluous
thread-reels
and
round
boxes
.
Adam
had
quite
a
*NL*
pride
in
the
little
squire
in
those
early
days
,
and
the
feeling
had
*NL*
only
become
slightly
modified
as
the
fair-haired
lad
had
grown
into
*NL*
the
whiskered
young
man
.
Adam
,
I
confess
,
was
very
susceptible
to
the
*NL*
influence
of
rank
,
and
quite
ready
to
give
an
extra
amount
of
respect
to
*NL*
every
one
who
had
more
advantages
than
himself
,
not
being
a
philosopher
*NL*
or
a
proletaire
with
democratic
ideas
,
but
simply
a
stout-limbed
clever
*NL*
carpenter
with
a
large
fund
of
reverence
in
his
nature
,
which
inclined
*NL*
him
to
admit
all
established
claims
unless
he
saw
very
clear
grounds
for
*NL*
questioning
them
.
He
had
no
theories
about
setting
the
world
to
rights
,
*NL*
but
he
saw
there
was
a
great
deal
of
damage
done
by
building
with
*NL*
ill-seasoned
timber
--
by
ignorant
men
in
fine
clothes
making
plans
for
*NL*
outhouses
and
workshops
and
the
like
without
knowing
the
bearings
of
*NL*
things
--
by
slovenly
joiners
'
work
,
and
by
hasty
contracts
that
could
*NL*
never
be
fulfilled
without
ruining
somebody
;
and
he
resolved
,
for
his
*NL*
part
,
to
set
his
face
against
such
doings
.
On
these
points
he
would
*NL*
have
maintained
his
opinion
against
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
*NL*
Loamshire
or
Stonyshire
either
;
but
he
felt
that
beyond
these
it
would
*NL*
be
better
for
him
to
defer
to
people
who
were
more
knowing
than
himself
.
*NL*
He
saw
as
plainly
as
possible
how
ill
the
woods
on
the
estate
were
*NL*
managed
,
and
the
shameful
state
of
the
farm-buildings
;
and
if
old
Squire
*NL*
Donnithorne
had
asked
him
the
effect
of
this
mismanagement
,
he
would
*NL*
have
spoken
his
opinion
without
flinching
,
but
the
impulse
to
a
*NL*
respectful
demeanour
towards
a
``
gentleman
''
would
have
been
strong
within
*NL*
him
all
the
while
.
The
word
``
gentleman
''
had
a
spell
for
Adam
,
and
,
as
he
*NL*
often
said
,
he
``
could
n't
abide
a
fellow
who
thought
he
made
himself
fine
*NL*
by
being
coxy
to
's
betters
.
''
I
must
remind
you
again
that
Adam
had
the
*NL*
blood
of
the
peasant
in
his
veins
,
and
that
since
he
was
in
his
prime
*NL*
half
a
century
ago
,
you
must
expect
some
of
his
characteristics
to
be
*NL*
obsolete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
young
squire
this
instinctive
reverence
of
Adam
's
was
*NL*
assisted
by
boyish
memories
and
personal
regard
so
you
may
imagine
that
*NL*
he
thought
far
more
of
Arthur
's
good
qualities
,
and
attached
far
more
*NL*
value
to
very
slight
actions
of
his
,
than
if
they
had
been
the
qualities
*NL*
and
actions
of
a
common
workman
like
himself
.
He
felt
sure
it
would
be
*NL*
a
fine
day
for
everybody
about
Hayslope
when
the
young
squire
came
into
*NL*
the
estate
--
such
a
generous
open-hearted
disposition
as
he
had
,
and
an
*NL*
``
uncommon
''
notion
about
improvements
and
repairs
,
considering
he
was
*NL*
only
just
coming
of
age
.
Thus
there
was
both
respect
and
affection
in
*NL*
the
smile
with
which
he
raised
his
paper
cap
as
Arthur
Donnithorne
rode
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Adam
,
how
are
you
?
''
said
Arthur
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
He
never
*NL*
shook
hands
with
any
of
the
farmers
,
and
Adam
felt
the
honour
keenly
.
``
I
*NL*
could
swear
to
your
back
a
long
way
off
.
It
's
just
the
same
back
,
only
*NL*
broader
,
as
when
you
used
to
carry
me
on
it
.
Do
you
remember
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
sir
,
I
remember
.
It
`
ud
be
a
poor
look-out
if
folks
did
n't
*NL*
remember
what
they
did
and
said
when
they
were
lads
.
We
should
think
no
*NL*
more
about
old
friends
than
we
do
about
new
uns
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
going
to
Broxton
,
I
suppose
?
''
said
Arthur
,
putting
his
horse
*NL*
on
at
a
slow
pace
while
Adam
walked
by
his
side
.
``
Are
you
going
to
the
*NL*
rectory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
I
'm
going
to
see
about
Bradwell
's
barn
.
They
're
afraid
of
the
*NL*
roof
pushing
the
walls
out
,
and
I
'm
going
to
see
what
can
be
done
with
*NL*
it
before
we
send
the
stuff
and
the
workmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Burge
trusts
almost
everything
to
you
now
,
Adam
,
does
n't
he
?
I
*NL*
should
think
he
will
make
you
his
partner
soon
.
He
will
,
if
he
's
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
see
as
he
'd
be
much
the
better
off
for
that
.
A
*NL*
foreman
,
if
he
's
got
a
conscience
and
delights
in
his
work
,
will
do
his
*NL*
business
as
well
as
if
he
was
a
partner
.
I
would
n't
give
a
penny
for
*NL*
a
man
as
`
ud
drive
a
nail
in
slack
because
he
did
n't
get
extra
pay
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
Adam
;
I
know
you
work
for
him
as
well
as
if
you
were
*NL*
working
for
yourself
.
But
you
would
have
more
power
than
you
have
now
,
*NL*
and
could
turn
the
business
to
better
account
perhaps
.
The
old
man
must
*NL*
give
up
his
business
sometime
,
and
he
has
no
son
;
I
suppose
he
'll
want
a
*NL*
son-in-law
who
can
take
to
it
.
But
he
has
rather
grasping
fingers
of
his
*NL*
own
,
I
fancy
.
I
daresay
he
wants
a
man
who
can
put
some
money
into
the
*NL*
business
.
If
I
were
not
as
poor
as
a
rat
,
I
would
gladly
invest
some
*NL*
money
in
that
way
,
for
the
sake
of
having
you
settled
on
the
estate
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
should
profit
by
it
in
the
end
.
And
perhaps
I
shall
be
better
off
*NL*
in
a
year
or
two
.
I
shall
have
a
larger
allowance
now
I
'm
of
age
;
and
*NL*
when
I
've
paid
off
a
debt
or
two
,
I
shall
be
able
to
look
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
good
to
say
so
,
sir
,
and
I
'm
not
unthankful
.
But
''
--
Adam
*NL*
continued
,
in
a
decided
tone
--
``
I
should
n't
like
to
make
any
offers
*NL*
to
Mr.
Burge
,
or

have
any

for
me

I
see
no
clear
road
to
a
*NL*
partnership
.
If
he
should
ever
want
to
dispose
of
the
business
,
that
`

*NL*

a
different
matter
.
I
should
be
glad
of
some
money
at
a
fair
interest
*NL*
then
,
for
I
feel
sure
I
could
pay
it
off
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Adam
,
''
said
Arthur
,
remembering
what
Mr.
Irwine
had
said
*NL*
about
a
probable
hitch
in
the
love-making
between
Adam
and
Mary
Burge
,
*NL*
``
we
'll
say
no
more
about
it
at
present

When
is
your
father
to
be
*NL*
buried
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Sunday
,
sir
;
Mr.
Irwine
's
coming
earlier
on
purpose

I
shall
be
glad
*NL*
when
it
's
over
,
for
I
think
my
mother
`
ull
perhaps
get
easier
then
.
It
*NL*
cuts
one
sadly
to
see
the
grief
of
old
people
;
they
've
no
way
o
'
working
*NL*
it
off
,
and
the
new
spring
brings
no
new
shoots
out
on
the
withered
*NL*
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
've
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
vexation
in
your
life

Adam
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
you
've
ever
been
hare-brained
and
light-hearted
,
like
*NL*
other
youngsters
.
You
've
always
had
some
care
on
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
sir

but
that
's
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about

If
we
're
men
*NL*
and
have
men
's
feelings
,
I
reckon
we
must
have
men
's
troubles
.
We
ca
n't
*NL*
be
like
the
birds

fly
from

soon

I

I

had
health

strength

brains
to
give
me
a
delight
in

work

I
count
it
*NL*
a
great
thing
as
I

had
Bartle
Massey

night-school
to
go
to
.
He

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

rare

said
Arthur
,
after
a
pause
,
in
which
*NL*
he
had
looked
musingly
at
the
big
fellow
walking
by
his
side
.
``
I
could
*NL*
hit
out
better

me
into

I
were
to
have
a
battle
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
I
should
ever
do
that

said
Adam
,
looking
round
at
*NL*
Arthur
and
smiling
.
``
I
used
to
fight
for
fun

I

poor
Gil

laid
up

*NL*
I
'll
never

any

again

only
when

If
you
get
hold

got
no

him

you

try
what
you

bunging
his

up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
did
not
laugh
,
for
he
was
preoccupied
with
some
thought
that
*NL*
made
him
say
presently
,
``
I
should
think
now

Adam

a
wish

right

indulge

as
easily
as
you

knock
down
a
drunken
fellow
who
was
quarrelsome
with
you

I
mean
,
*NL*
you
are
never
shilly-shally
,
first
making
up
your
mind
that
you
wo
n't
do
*NL*
a
thing
,
and
then
doing
it
after
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Adam
,
slowly
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
``
no
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
ever
being
see-saw
in
that
way

when
I
'd
made
my
mind
up
,
as
*NL*
you
say
,
that
a
thing
was
wrong
.
It
takes
the
taste
out
o
'
my
mouth
for
*NL*
things
,
when
I
know
I
should
have
a
heavy
conscience
after
'em
.
I
've
*NL*
seen
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
could
cast
up
a
sum

as
you
can
never
*NL*
do
what
's
wrong
without
breeding
sin
and
trouble
more
than
you
can
ever
*NL*
see

It
's
like
a
bit

bad
workmanship

you
never
see
th

end
o

the
*NL*
mischief
it
'll
do

And
it
's
a
poor
look-out
to
come
into
the
world
to
*NL*
make
your
fellow-creatures
worse
off
instead

better

But
there
's
a

difference

folks

sin

may
be
let

a
man
may
have
two
minds
whether

it
is

worthwhile
to
get
a
bruise
or
two
for
the
sake
of
a
bit
o

fun

*NL*
But
it
is
n't
my
way
to
be
see-saw
about
anything
:
I
think
my
fault
lies
*NL*
th

other
way
.
When
I
've
said
a
thing
,
if
it
's
only
to
myself

it
's
hard
*NL*
for
me
to
go
back

walked
along
*NL*
the
gravel
towards
the
door
which
opened
on
the
garden
.
He
knew
that
the
*NL*
rector
always
breakfasted
in
his
study
,
and
the
study
lay
on
the
left
*NL*
hand
of
this
door
,
opposite
the
dining-room
.
It
was
a
small
low
room
,
*NL*
belonging
to
the
old
part
of
the
house
--
dark
with
the
sombre
covers
of
*NL*
the
books
that
lined
the
walls
;
yet
it
looked
very
cheery
this
morning
*NL*
as
Arthur
reached
the
open
window
.
For
the
morning
sun
fell
aslant
on
*NL*
the
great
glass
globe
with
gold
fish
in
it
,
which
stood
on
a
scagliola
*NL*
pillar
in
front
of
the
ready-spread
bachelor
breakfast-table
,
and
by
the
*NL*
side
of
this
breakfast-table
was
a
group
which
would
have
made
any
room
*NL*
enticing
.
In
the
crimson
damask
easy-chair
sat
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
that
*NL*
radiant
freshness
which
he
always
had
when
he
came
from
his
morning
*NL*
toilet
;
his
finely
formed
plump
white
hand
was
playing
along
Juno
's
*NL*
brown
curly
back
;
and
close
to
Juno
's
tail
,
which
was
wagging
with
calm
*NL*
matronly
pleasure
,
the
two
brown
pups
were
rolling
over
each
other
in
an
*NL*
ecstatic
duet
of
worrying
noises
.
On
a
cushion
a
little
removed
sat
*NL*
Pug
,
with
the
air
of
a
maiden
lady
,
who
looked
on
these
familiarities
*NL*
as
animal
weaknesses
,
which
she
made
as
little
show
as
possible
of
*NL*
observing
.
On
the
table
,
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
elbow
,
lay
the
first
volume
of
*NL*
the
Foulis
AEschylus
,
which
Arthur
knew
well
by
sight
;
and
the
silver
*NL*
coffee-pot
,
which
Carroll
was
bringing
in
,
sent
forth
a
fragrant
steam
*NL*
which
completed
the
delights
of
a
bachelor
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Arthur
,
that
's
a
good
fellow
!
You
're
just
in
time
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
,
as
Arthur
paused
and
stepped
in
over
the
low
window-sill
.
*NL*
``
Carroll
,
we
shall
want
more
coffee
and
eggs
,
and
have
n't
you
got
some
*NL*
cold
fowl
for
us
to
eat
with
that
ham
?
Why
,
this
is
like
old
days
,
*NL*
Arthur
;
you
have
n't
been
to
breakfast
with
me
these
five
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
tempting
morning
for
a
ride
before
breakfast
,
''
said
Arthur
;
*NL*
``
and
I
used
to
like
breakfasting
with
you
so
when
I
was
reading
with
*NL*
you
.
My
grandfather
is
always
a
few
degrees
colder
at
breakfast
than
at
*NL*
any
other
hour
in
the
day
.
I
think
his
morning
bath
does
n't
agree
with
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
anxious
not
to
imply
that
he
came
with
any
special
purpose
.
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
found
himself
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
presence
than
the
*NL*
confidence
which
he
had
thought
quite
easy
before
,
suddenly
appeared
*NL*
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
him
,
and
at
the
very
moment
of
*NL*
shaking
hands
he
saw
his
purpose
in
quite
a
new
light
.
How
could
he
make
*NL*
Irwine
understand
his
position
unless
he
told
him
those
little
scenes
*NL*
in
the
wood
;
and
how
could
he
tell
them
without
looking
like
a
fool
?
*NL*
And
then
his
weakness
in
coming
back
from
Gawaine
's
,
and
doing
the
very
*NL*
opposite
of
what
he
intended
!
Irwine
would
think
him
a
shilly-shally
*NL*
fellow
ever
after
.
However
,
it
must
come
out
in
an
unpremeditated
way
;
*NL*
the
conversation
might
lead
up
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
breakfast-time
better
than
any
other
moment
in
the
day
,
''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
No
dust
has
settled
on
one
's
mind
then
,
and
it
presents
a
*NL*
clear
mirror
to
the
rays
of
things
.
I
always
have
a
favourite
book
by
*NL*
me
at
breakfast
,
and
I
enjoy
the
bits
I
pick
up
then
so
much
,
that
*NL*
regularly
every
morning
it
seems
to
me
as
if
I
should
certainly
become
*NL*
studious
again
.
But
presently
Dent
brings
up
a
poor
fellow
who
has
*NL*
killed
a
hare
,
and
when
I
've
got
through
my
`
justicing
,
'
as
Carroll
*NL*
calls
it
,
I
'm
inclined
for
a
ride
round
the
glebe
,
and
on
my
way
back
*NL*
I
meet
with
the
master
of
the
workhouse
,
who
has
got
a
long
story
of
a
*NL*
mutinous
pauper
to
tell
me
;
and
so
the
day
goes
on
,
and
I
'm
always
the
*NL*
same
lazy
fellow
before
evening
sets
in
.
Besides
,
one
wants
the
*NL*
stimulus
of
sympathy
,
and
I
have
never
had
that
since
poor
D'Oyley
left
*NL*
Treddleston
.
If
you
had
stuck
to
your
books
well
,
you
rascal
,
I
should
*NL*
have
had
a
pleasanter
prospect
before
me
.
But
scholarship
does
n't
run
in
*NL*
your
family
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
indeed
.
It
's
well
if
I
can
remember
a
little
inapplicable
Latin
to
*NL*
adorn
my
maiden
speech
in
Parliament
six
or
seven
years
hence
.
`
Cras
*NL*
ingens
iterabimus
aequor
,
'
and
a
few
shreds
of
that
sort
,
will
perhaps
*NL*
stick
to
me
,
and
I
shall
arrange
my
opinions
so
as
to
introduce
them
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
think
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
is
a
pressing
want
to
*NL*
a
country
gentleman
;
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
he
'd
much
better
have
a
*NL*
knowledge
of
manures
.
I
've
been
reading
your
friend
Arthur
Young
's
books
*NL*
lately
,
and
there
's
nothing
I
should
like
better
than
to
carry
out
some
*NL*
of
his
ideas
in
putting
the
farmers
on
a
better
management
of
their
*NL*
land
;
and
,
as
he
says
,
making
what
was
a
wild
country
,
all
of
the
same
*NL*
dark
hue
,
bright
and
variegated
with
corn
and
cattle
.
My
grandfather
*NL*
will
never
let
me
have
any
power
while
he
lives
,
but
there
's
nothing
*NL*
I
should
like
better
than
to
undertake
the
Stonyshire
side
of
the
*NL*
estate
--
it
's
in
a
dismal
condition
--
and
set
improvements
on
foot
,
and
*NL*
gallop
about
from
one
place
to
another
and
overlook
them
.
I
should
like
*NL*
to
know
all
the
labourers
,
and
see
them
touching
their
hats
to
me
with
a
*NL*
look
of
goodwill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
Arthur
!
A
man
who
has
no
feeling
for
the
classics
could
n't
*NL*
make
a
better
apology
for
coming
into
the
world
than
by
increasing
*NL*
the
quantity
of
food
to
maintain
scholars
--
and
rectors
who
appreciate
*NL*
scholars
.
And
whenever
you
enter
on
your
career
of
model
landlord
may
*NL*
I
be
there
to
see
.
You
'll
want
a
portly
rector
to
complete
the
picture
,
*NL*
and
take
his
tithe
of
all
the
respect
and
honour
you
get
by
your
hard
*NL*
work
.
Only
do
n't
set
your
heart
too
strongly
on
the
goodwill
you
are
to
*NL*
get
in
consequence
.
I
'm
not
sure
that
men
are
the
fondest
of
those
who
*NL*
try
to
be
useful
to
them
.
You
know
Gawaine
has
got
the
curses
of
the
*NL*
whole
neighbourhood
upon
him
about
that
enclosure
.
You
must
make
*NL*
it
quite
clear
to
your
mind
which
you
are
most
bent
upon
,
old
*NL*
boy
--
popularity
or
usefulness
--
else
you
may
happen
to
miss
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Gawaine
is
harsh
in
his
manners
;
he
does
n't
make
himself
personally
*NL*
agreeable
to
his
tenants
.
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
anything
you
ca
n't
*NL*
prevail
on
people
to
do
with
kindness
.
For
my
part
,
I
could
n't
live
in
*NL*
a
neighbourhood
where
I
was
not
respected
and
beloved
.
And
it
's
very
*NL*
pleasant
to
go
among
the
tenants
here
--
they
seem
all
so
well
inclined
*NL*
to
me
I
suppose
it
seems
only
the
other
day
to
them
since
I
was
a
little
*NL*
lad
,
riding
on
a
pony
about
as
big
as
a
sheep
.
And
if
fair
allowances
*NL*
were
made
to
them
,
and
their
buildings
attended
to
,
one
could
persuade
*NL*
them
to
farm
on
a
better
plan
,
stupid
as
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
mind
you
fall
in
love
in
the
right
place
,
and
do
n't
get
a
wife
who
*NL*
will
drain
your
purse
and
make
you
niggardly
in
spite
of
yourself
.
My
*NL*
mother
and
I
have
a
little
discussion
about
you
sometimes
:
she
says
,
`
I
'll
*NL*
never
risk
a
single
prophecy
on
Arthur
until
I
see
the
woman
he
falls
*NL*
in
love
with
.
'
She
thinks
your
lady-love
will
rule
you
as
the
moon
rules
*NL*
the
tides
.
But
I
feel
bound
to
stand
up
for
you
,
as
my
pupil
you
know
,
*NL*
and
I
maintain
that
you
're
not
of
that
watery
quality
.
So
mind
you
do
n't
*NL*
disgrace
my
judgment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
winced
under
this
speech
,
for
keen
old
Mrs.
Irwine
's
opinion
*NL*
about
him
had
the
disagreeable
effect
of
a
sinister
omen
.
This
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
was
only
another
reason
for
persevering
in
his
intention
,
and
*NL*
getting
an
additional
security
against
himself
.
Nevertheless
,
at
this
*NL*
point
in
the
conversation
,
he
was
conscious
of
increased
disinclination
*NL*
to
tell
his
story
about
Hetty
.
He
was
of
an
impressible
nature
,
and
*NL*
lived
a
great
deal
in
other
people
's
opinions
and
feelings
concerning
*NL*
himself
;
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
an
intimate
*NL*
friend
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
notion
that
he
had
had
any
such
*NL*
serious
internal
struggle
as
he
came
to
confide
,
rather
shook
his
own
*NL*
belief
in
the
seriousness
of
the
struggle
.
It
was
not
,
after
all
,
a
*NL*
thing
to
make
a
fuss
about
;
and
what
could
Irwine
do
for
him
that
he
*NL*
could
not
do
for
himself
?
He
would
go
to
Eagledale
in
spite
of
Meg
's
*NL*
lameness
--
go
on
Rattler
,
and
let
Pym
follow
as
well
as
he
could
on
the
*NL*
old
hack
.
That
was
his
thought
as
he
sugared
his
coffee
;
but
the
*NL*
next
minute
,
as
he
was
lifting
the
cup
to
his
lips
,
he
remembered
how
*NL*
thoroughly
he
had
made
up
his
mind
last
night
to
tell
Irwine
.
No
!
He
*NL*
would
not
be
vacillating
again
--
he
WOULD
do
what
he
had
meant
to
do
,
*NL*
this
time
.
So
it
would
be
well
not
to
let
the
personal
tone
of
the
*NL*
conversation
altogether
drop
.
If
they
went
to
quite
indifferent
topics
,
*NL*
his
difficulty
would
be
heightened
.
It
had
required
no
noticeable
pause
*NL*
for
this
rush
and
rebound
of
feeling
,
before
he
answered
,
``
But
I
think
*NL*
it
is
hardly
an
argument
against
a
man
's
general
strength
of
character
*NL*
that
he
should
be
apt
to
be
mastered
by
love
.
A
fine
constitution
*NL*
does
n't
insure
one
against
smallpox
or
any
other
of
those
inevitable
*NL*
diseases
.
A
man
may
be
very
firm
in
other
matters
and
yet
be
under
a
*NL*
sort
of
witchery
from
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
there
's
this
difference
between
love
and
smallpox
,
or
*NL*
bewitchment
either
--
that
if
you
detect
the
disease
at
an
early
stage
and
*NL*
try
change
of
air
,
there
is
every
chance
of
complete
escape
without
any
*NL*
further
development
of
symptoms
.
And
there
are
certain
alternative
doses
*NL*
which
a
man
may
administer
to
himself
by
keeping
unpleasant
consequences
*NL*
before
his
mind
:
this
gives
you
a
sort
of
smoked
glass
through
which
*NL*
you
may
look
at
the
resplendent
fair
one
and
discern
her
true
outline
;
*NL*
though
I
'm
afraid
,
by
the
by
,
the
smoked
glass
is
apt
to
be
missing
just
*NL*
at
the
moment
it
is
most
wanted
.
I
daresay
,
now
,
even
a
man
fortified
*NL*
with
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
might
be
lured
into
an
imprudent
*NL*
marriage
,
in
spite
of
the
warning
given
him
by
the
chorus
in
the
*NL*
Prometheus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
that
flitted
across
Arthur
's
face
was
a
faint
one
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
following
Mr.
Irwine
's
playful
lead
,
he
said
,
quite
seriously
--
``
Yes
,
*NL*
that
's
the
worst
of
it
.
It
's
a
desperately
vexatious
thing
,
that
after
*NL*
all
one
's
reflections
and
quiet
determinations
,
we
should
be
ruled
by
*NL*
moods
that
one
ca
n't
calculate
on
beforehand
.
I
do
n't
think
a
man
ought
*NL*
to
be
blamed
so
much
if
he
is
betrayed
into
doing
things
in
that
way
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
resolutions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
the
moods
lie
in
his
nature
,
my
boy
,
just
as
much
as
his
*NL*
reflections
did
,
and
more
.
A
man
can
never
do
anything
at
variance
with
*NL*
his
own
nature
.
He
carries
within
him
the
germ
of
his
most
exceptional
*NL*
action
;
and
if
we
wise
people
make
eminent
fools
of
ourselves
on
any
*NL*
particular
occasion
,
we
must
endure
the
legitimate
conclusion
that
we
*NL*
carry
a
few
grains
of
folly
to
our
ounce
of
wisdom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
one
may
be
betrayed
into
doing
things
by
a
combination
of
*NL*
circumstances

one
might
never
have
done
otherwise

``
Why

yes

man
ca
n't
very
well
steal
a
bank-note

the
bank-note

lies
within
convenient
reach
;
but
he
wo
n't
make
us
think
him

honest

he
begins
to
howl
at

bank-note

falling
in

``
No

that
went
before
--
consequences
that
*NL*
are
hardly
ever
confined
to
ourselves
.
And
it
is
best
to
fix
our
minds
*NL*
on
that
certainty
,
instead
of
considering
what
may
be
the
elements
of
*NL*
excuse
for
us
.
But
I
never
knew
you
so
inclined
for
moral
discussion
,
*NL*
Arthur
?
Is
it
some
danger
of
your
own
that
you
are
considering
in
this
*NL*
philosophical
,
general
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
asking
this
question
,
Mr.
Irwine
pushed
his
plate
away
,
threw
himself
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looked
straight
at
Arthur
.
He
really
suspected
*NL*
that
Arthur
wanted
to
tell
him
something
,
and
thought
of
smoothing
*NL*
the
way
for
him
by
this
direct
question
.
But
he
was
mistaken
.
Brought
*NL*
suddenly
and
involuntarily
to
the
brink
of
confession
,
Arthur
shrank
*NL*
back
and
felt
less
disposed
towards
it
than
ever
.
The
conversation
had
*NL*
taken
a
more
serious
tone
than
he
had
intended
--
it
would
quite
mislead
*NL*
Irwine
--
he
would
imagine
there
was
a
deep
passion
for
Hetty
,
while
there
*NL*
was
no
such
thing
.
He
was
conscious
of
colouring
,
and
was
annoyed
at
his
*NL*
boyishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
no
danger
,
''
he
said
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
that
I
am
more
liable
to
irresolution
than
other
people
;
only
there
are
*NL*
little
incidents
now
and
then
that
set
one
speculating
on
what
might
*NL*
happen
in
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
a
motive
at
work
under
this
strange
reluctance
of
Arthur
's
*NL*
which
had
a
sort
of
backstairs
influence
,
not
admitted
to
himself
?
Our
*NL*
mental
business
is
carried
on
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
business
*NL*
of
the
State
:
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
is
done
by
agents
who
are
not
*NL*
acknowledged
.
In
a
piece
of
machinery
,
too
,
I
believe
there
is
often
a
*NL*
small
unnoticeable
wheel
which
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
motion
of
*NL*
the
large
obvious
ones
.
Possibly
there
was
some
such
unrecognized
agent
*NL*
secretly
busy
in
Arthur
's
mind
at
this
moment
--
possibly
it
was
the
fear
*NL*
lest
he
might
hereafter
find
the
fact
of
having
made
a
confession
to
the
*NL*
rector
a
serious
annoyance
,
in
case
he
should
NOT
be
able
quite
to
carry
*NL*
out
his
good
resolutions
?
I
dare
not
assert
that
it
was
not
so
.
The
*NL*
human
soul
is
a
very
complex
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
Hetty
had
just
crossed
Mr.
Irwine
's
mind
as
he
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
Arthur
,
but
his
disclaiming
indifferent
answer
confirmed
*NL*
the
thought
which
had
quickly
followed
--
that
there
could
be
nothing
*NL*
serious
in
that
direction
.
There
was
no
probability
that
Arthur
ever
saw
*NL*
her
except
at
church
,
and
at
her
own
home
under
the
eye
of
Mrs.
Poyser
;
*NL*
and
the
hint
he
had
given
Arthur
about
her
the
other
day
had
no
more
*NL*
serious
meaning
than
to
prevent
him
from
noticing
her
so
as
to
rouse
the
*NL*
little
chit
's
vanity
,
and
in
this
way
perturb
the
rustic
drama
of
her
*NL*
life
.
Arthur
would
soon
join
his
regiment
,
and
be
far
away
:
no
,
there
*NL*
could
be
no
danger
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
Arthur
's
character
had
not
*NL*
been
a
strong
security
against
it
.
His
honest
,
patronizing
pride
in
*NL*
the
good-will
and
respect
of
everybody
about
him
was
a
safeguard
even
*NL*
against
foolish
romance
,
still
more
against
a
lower
kind
of
folly
.
*NL*
If
there
had
been
anything
special
on
Arthur
's
mind
in
the
previous
*NL*
conversation
,
it
was
clear
he
was
not
inclined
to
enter
into
details
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Irwine
was
too
delicate
to
imply
even
a
friendly
curiosity
.
He
*NL*
perceived
a
change
of
subject
would
be
welcome
,
and
said
,
``
By
the
way
,
*NL*
Arthur
,
at
your
colonel
's
birthday
fete
there
were
some
transparencies
*NL*
that
made
a
great
effect
in
honour
of
Britannia
,
and
Pitt
,
and
the
*NL*
Loamshire
Militia
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
`
generous
youth
,
'
the
hero
of
*NL*
the
day
.
Do
n't
you
think
you
should
get
up
something
of
the
same
sort
to
*NL*
astonish
our
weak
minds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
opportunity
was
gone
.
While
Arthur
was
hesitating
,
the
rope
to
*NL*
which
he
might
have
clung
had
drifted
away
--
he
must
trust
now
to
his
own
*NL*
swimming
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
from
that
time
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
called
for
on
business
,
*NL*
and
Arthur
,
bidding
him
good-bye
,
mounted
his
horse
again
with
a
sense
*NL*
of
dissatisfaction
,
which
he
tried
to
quell
by
determining
to
set
off
*NL*
for
Eagledale
without
an
hour
's
delay
.

Chapter
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
In
Which
the
Story
Pauses
a
Little
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
THIS
Rector
of
Broxton
is
little
better
than
a
pagan
!
''
I
hear
one
of
my
*NL*
readers
exclaim
.
``
How
much
more
edifying
it
would
have
been
if
you
had
*NL*
made
him
give
Arthur
some
truly
spiritual
advice
!
You
might
have
put
*NL*
into
his
mouth
the
most
beautiful
things
--
quite
as
good
as
reading
a
*NL*
sermon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
I
could
,
if
I
held
it
the
highest
vocation
of
the
novelist
*NL*
to
represent
things
as
they
never
have
been
and
never
will
be
.
Then
,
*NL*
of
course
,
I
might
refashion
life
and
character
entirely
after
my
own
*NL*
liking
;
I
might
select
the
most
unexceptionable
type
of
clergyman
and
*NL*
put
my
own
admirable
opinions
into
his
mouth
on
all
occasions
.
But
it
*NL*
happens
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
my
strongest
effort
is
to
avoid
any
such
*NL*
arbitrary
picture
,
and
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
men
and
things
*NL*
as
they
have
mirrored
themselves
in
my
mind
.
The
mirror
is
doubtless
*NL*
defective
,
the
outlines
will
sometimes
be
disturbed
,
the
reflection
*NL*
faint
or
confused
;
but
I
feel
as
much
bound
to
tell
you
as
precisely
*NL*
as
I
can
what
that
reflection
is
,
as
if
I
were
in
the
witness-box
,
*NL*
narrating
my
experience
on
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sixty
years
ago
--
it
is
a
long
time
,
so
no
wonder
things
have
*NL*
changed
--
all
clergymen
were
not
zealous
;
indeed
,
there
is
reason
to
*NL*
believe
that
the
number
of
zealous
clergymen
was
small
,
and
it
is
*NL*
probable
that
if
one
among
the
small
minority
had
owned
the
livings
*NL*
of
Broxton
and
Hayslope
in
the
year
1799
,
you
would
have
liked
him
no
*NL*
better
than
you
like
Mr.
Irwine
.
Ten
to
one
,
you
would
have
thought
him
*NL*
a
tasteless
,
indiscreet
,
methodistical
man
.
It
is
so
very
rarely
that
*NL*
facts
hit
that
nice
medium
required
by
our
own
enlightened
opinions
and
*NL*
refined
taste
!
Perhaps
you
will
say
,
``
Do
improve
the
facts
a
little
,
*NL*
then
;
make
them
more
accordant
with
those
correct
views
which
it
is
our
*NL*
privilege
to
possess
.
The
world
is
not
just
what
we
like
;
do
touch
it
*NL*
up
with
a
tasteful
pencil
,
and
make
believe
it
is
not
quite
such
a
mixed
*NL*
entangled
affair
.
Let
all
people
who
hold
unexceptionable
opinions
act
*NL*
unexceptionably
.
Let
your
most
faulty
characters
always
be
on
the
wrong
*NL*
side
,
and
your
virtuous
ones
on
the
right
.
Then
we
shall
see
at
a
glance
*NL*
whom
we
are
to
condemn
and
whom
we
are
to
approve
.
Then
we
shall
be
able
*NL*
to
admire
,
without
the
slightest
disturbance
of
our
prepossessions
:
we
*NL*
shall
hate
and
despise
with
that
true
ruminant
relish
which
belongs
to
*NL*
undoubting
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
my
good
friend
,
what
will
you
do
then
with
your
fellow-parishioner
*NL*
who
opposes
your
husband
in
the
vestry
?
With
your
newly
appointed
vicar
,
*NL*
whose
style
of
preaching
you
find
painfully
below
that
of
his
regretted
*NL*
predecessor
?
With
the
honest
servant
who
worries
your
soul
with
her
one
*NL*
failing
?
With
your
neighbour
,
Mrs.
Green
,
who
was
really
kind
to
you
*NL*
in
your
last
illness
,
but
has
said
several
ill-natured
things
about
you
*NL*
since
your
convalescence
?
Nay
,
with
your
excellent
husband
himself
,
who
*NL*
has
other
irritating
habits
besides
that
of
not
wiping
his
shoes
?
These
*NL*
fellow-mortals
,
every
one
,
must
be
accepted
as
they
are
:
you
can
neither
*NL*
straighten
their
noses
,
nor
brighten
their
wit
,
nor
rectify
their
*NL*
dispositions
;
and
it
is
these
people
--
amongst
whom
your
life
is
*NL*
passed
--
that
it
is
needful
you
should
tolerate
,
pity
,
and
love
:
it
is
*NL*
these
more
or
less
ugly
,
stupid
,
inconsistent
people
whose
movements
of
*NL*
goodness
you
should
be
able
to
admire
--
for
whom
you
should
cherish
all
*NL*
possible
hopes
,
all
possible
patience
.
And
I
would
not
,
even
if
I
had
*NL*
the
choice
,
be
the
clever
novelist
who
could
create
a
world
so
much
*NL*
better
than
this
,
in
which
we
get
up
in
the
morning
to
do
our
daily
*NL*
work
,
that
you
would
be
likely
to
turn
a
harder
,
colder
eye
on
the
*NL*
dusty
streets
and
the
common
green
fields
--
on
the
real
breathing
men
*NL*
and
women
,
who
can
be
chilled
by
your
indifference
or
injured
by
your
*NL*
prejudice
;
who
can
be
cheered
and
helped
onward
by
your
fellow-feeling
,
*NL*
your
forbearance
,
your
outspoken
,
brave
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
am
content
to
tell
my
simple
story
,
without
trying
to
make
things
*NL*
seem
better
than
they
were
;
dreading
nothing
,
indeed
,
but
falsity
,
*NL*
which
,
in
spite
of
one
's
best
efforts
,
there
is
reason
to
dread
.
*NL*
Falsehood
is
so
easy
,
truth
so
difficult
.
The
pencil
is
conscious
of
a
*NL*
delightful
facility
in
drawing
a
griffin
--
the
longer
the
claws
,
and
*NL*
the
larger
the
wings
,
the
better
;
but
that
marvellous
facility
which
*NL*
we
mistook
for
genius
is
apt
to
forsake
us
when
we
want
to
draw
a
real
*NL*
unexaggerated
lion
.
Examine
your
words
well
,
and
you
will
find
that
even
*NL*
when
you
have
no
motive
to
be
false
,
it
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
say
the
*NL*
exact
truth
,
even
about
your
own
immediate
feelings
--
much
harder
than
to
*NL*
say
something
fine
about
them
which
is
NOT
the
exact
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
for
this
rare
,
precious
quality
of
truthfulness
that
I
delight
in
*NL*
many
Dutch
paintings
,
which
lofty-minded
people
despise
.
I
find
a
source
*NL*
of
delicious
sympathy
in
these
faithful
pictures
of
a
monotonous
*NL*
homely
existence
,
which
has
been
the
fate
of
so
many
more
among
my
*NL*
fellow-mortals
than
a
life
of
pomp
or
of
absolute
indigence
,
of
tragic
*NL*
suffering
or
of
world-stirring
actions
.
I
turn
,
without
shrinking
,
from
*NL*
cloud-borne
angels
,
from
prophets
,
sibyls
,
and
heroic
warriors
,
to
an
*NL*
old
woman
bending
over
her
flower-pot
,
or
eating
her
solitary
dinner
,
*NL*
while
the
noonday
light
,
softened
perhaps
by
a
screen
of
leaves
,
falls
*NL*
on
her
mob-cap
,
and
just
touches
the
rim
of
her
spinning-wheel
,
and
*NL*
her
stone
jug
,
and
all
those
cheap
common
things
which
are
the
precious
*NL*
necessaries
of
life
to
her
--
or
I
turn
to
that
village
wedding
,
kept
*NL*
between
four
brown
walls
,
where
an
awkward
bridegroom
opens
the
dance
*NL*
with
a
high-shouldered
,
broad-faced
bride
,
while
elderly
and
middle-aged
*NL*
friends
look
on
,
with
very
irregular
noses
and
lips
,
and
probably
*NL*
with
quart-pots
in
their
hands
,
but
with
an
expression
of
unmistakable
*NL*
contentment
and
goodwill
.
``
Foh
!
''
says
my
idealistic
friend
,
``
what
vulgar
*NL*
details
!
What
good
is
there
in
taking
all
these
pains
to
give
an
exact
*NL*
likeness
of
old
women
and
clowns
?
What
a
low
phase
of
life
!
What
clumsy
,
*NL*
ugly
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
bless
us
,
things
may
be
lovable
that
are
not
altogether
handsome
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
the
majority
of
the
human
race
have
*NL*
not
been
ugly
,
and
even
among
those
``
lords
of
their
kind
,
''
the
British
,
*NL*
squat
figures
,
ill-shapen
nostrils
,
and
dingy
complexions
are
not
*NL*
startling
exceptions
.
Yet
there
is
a
great
deal
of
family
love
amongst
*NL*
us
.
I
have
a
friend
or
two
whose
class
of
features
is
such
that
the
*NL*
Apollo
curl
on
the
summit
of
their
brows
would
be
decidedly
trying
;
yet
*NL*
to
my
certain
knowledge
tender
hearts
have
beaten
for
them
,
and
their
*NL*
miniatures
--
flattering
,
but
still
not
lovely
--
are
kissed
in
secret
by
*NL*
motherly
lips
.
I
have
seen
many
an
excellent
matron
,
who
could
have
*NL*
never
in
her
best
days
have
been
handsome
,
and
yet
she
had
a
packet
of
*NL*
yellow
love-letters
in
a
private
drawer
,
and
sweet
children
showered
*NL*
kisses
on
her
sallow
cheeks
.
And
I
believe
there
have
been
plenty
of
*NL*
young
heroes
,
of
middle
stature
and
feeble
beards
,
who
have
felt
quite
*NL*
sure
they
could
never
love
anything
more
insignificant
than
a
Diana
,
and
*NL*
yet
have
found
themselves
in
middle
life
happily
settled
with
a
wife
who
*NL*
waddles
.
Yes
!
Thank
God
;
human
feeling
is
like
the
mighty
rivers
that
*NL*
bless
the
earth
:
it
does
not
wait
for
beauty
--
it
flows
with
resistless
*NL*
force
and
brings
beauty
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
honour
and
reverence
to
the
divine
beauty
of
form
!
Let
us
cultivate
*NL*
it
to
the
utmost
in
men
,
women
,
and
children
--
in
our
gardens
and
in
our
*NL*
houses
.
But
let
us
love
that
other
beauty
too
,
which
lies
in
no
secret
*NL*
of
proportion
,
but
in
the
secret
of
deep
human
sympathy
.
Paint
us
an
*NL*
angel
,
if
you
can
,
with
a
floating
violet
robe
,
and
a
face
paled
by
the
*NL*
celestial
light
;
paint
us
yet
oftener
a
Madonna
,
turning
her
mild
face
*NL*
upward
and
opening
her
arms
to
welcome
the
divine
glory
;
but
do
not
*NL*
impose
on
us
any
aesthetic
rules
which
shall
banish
from
the
region
of
*NL*
Art
those
old
women
scraping
carrots
with
their
work-worn
hands
,
those
*NL*
heavy
clowns
taking
holiday
in
a
dingy
pot-house
,
those
rounded
backs
*NL*
and
stupid
weather-beaten
faces
that
have
bent
over
the
spade
and
done
*NL*
the
rough
work
of
the
world
--
those
homes
with
their
tin
pans
,
their
*NL*
brown
pitchers
,
their
rough
curs
,
and
their
clusters
of
onions
.
In
*NL*
this
world
there
are
so
many
of
these
common
coarse
people
,
who
have
*NL*
no
picturesque
sentimental
wretchedness
!
It
is
so
needful
we
should
*NL*
remember
their
existence
,
else
we
may
happen
to
leave
them
quite
out
of
*NL*
our
religion
and
philosophy
and
frame
lofty
theories
which
only
fit
*NL*
a
world
of
extremes
.
Therefore
,
let
Art
always
remind
us
of
them
;
*NL*
therefore
let
us
always
have
men
ready
to
give
the
loving
pains
of
a
*NL*
life
to
the
faithful
representing
of
commonplace
things
--
men
who
see
*NL*
beauty
in
these
commonplace
things
,
and
delight
in
showing
how
kindly
*NL*
the
light
of
heaven
falls
on
them
.
There
are
few
prophets
in
the
world
;
*NL*
few
sublimely
beautiful
women
;
few
heroes
.
I
ca
n't
afford
to
give
all
*NL*
my
love
and
reverence
to
such
rarities
:
I
want
a
great
deal
of
those
*NL*
feelings
for
my
every-day
fellow-men
,
especially
for
the
few
in
the
*NL*
foreground
of
the
great
multitude
,
whose
faces
I
know
,
whose
hands
I
*NL*
touch
,
for
whom
I
have
to
make
way
with
kindly
courtesy
.
Neither
are
*NL*
picturesque
lazzaroni
or
romantic
criminals
half
so
frequent
as
your
*NL*
common
labourer
,
who
gets
his
own
bread
and
eats
it
vulgarly
but
*NL*
creditably
with
his
own
pocket-knife
.
It
is
more
needful
that
I
should
*NL*
have
a
fibre
of
sympathy
connecting
me
with
that
vulgar
citizen
who
*NL*
weighs
out
my
sugar
in
a
vilely
assorted
cravat
and
waistcoat
,
than
with
*NL*
the
handsomest
rascal
in
red
scarf
and
green
feathers
--
more
needful
that
*NL*
my
heart
should
swell
with
loving
admiration
at
some
trait
of
gentle
*NL*
goodness
in
the
faulty
people
who
sit
at
the
same
hearth
with
me
,
or
in
*NL*
the
clergyman
of
my
own
parish
,
who
is
perhaps
rather
too
corpulent
and
*NL*
in
other
respects
is
not
an
Oberlin
or
a
Tillotson
,
than
at
the
deeds
*NL*
of
heroes
whom
I
shall
never
know
except
by
hearsay
,
or
at
the
sublimest
*NL*
abstract
of
all
clerical
graces
that
was
ever
conceived
by
an
able
*NL*
novelist
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
come
back
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
whom
I
desire
you
to
be
in
*NL*
perfect
charity
,
far
as
he
may
be
from
satisfying
your
demands
on
the
*NL*
clerical
character
.
Perhaps
you
think
he
was
not
--
as
he
ought
to
have
*NL*
been
--
a
living
demonstration
of
the
benefits
attached
to
a
national
*NL*
church
?
But
I
am
not
sure
of
that
;
at
least
I
know
that
the
people
*NL*
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
part
with
their
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
that
most
faces
brightened
at
his
approach
;
and
until
it
*NL*
can
be
proved
that
hatred
is
a
better
thing
for
the
soul
than
love
,
*NL*
I
must
believe
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
influence
in
his
parish
was
a
more
*NL*
wholesome
one
than
that
of
the
zealous
Mr.
Ryde
,
who
came
there
twenty
*NL*
years
afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Irwine
had
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
.
It
*NL*
is
true
,
Mr.
Ryde
insisted
strongly
on
the
doctrines
of
the
Reformation
,
*NL*
visited
his
flock
a
great
deal
in
their
own
homes
,
and
was
severe
*NL*
in
rebuking
the
aberrations
of
the
flesh
--
put
a
stop
,
indeed
,
to
the
*NL*
Christmas
rounds
of
the
church
singers
,
as
promoting
drunkenness
and
*NL*
too
light
a
handling
of
sacred
things
.
But
I
gathered
from
Adam
Bede
,
to
*NL*
whom
I
talked
of
these
matters
in
his
old
age
,
that
few
clergymen
could
*NL*
be
less
successful
in
winning
the
hearts
of
their
parishioners
than
Mr.
*NL*
Ryde
.
They
learned
a
great
many
notions
about
doctrine
from
him
,
so
*NL*
that
almost
every
church-goer
under
fifty
began
to
distinguish
as
well
*NL*
between
the
genuine
gospel
and
what
did
not
come
precisely
up
to
that
*NL*
standard
,
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
a
Dissenter
;
and
for
some
time
*NL*
after
his
arrival
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
religious
movement
in
that
*NL*
quiet
rural
district
.
``
But
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
I
've
seen
pretty
clear
,
ever
*NL*
since
I
was
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
notions
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
notions
sets
people
doing
the
right
thing
--
it
's
feelings
.
It
's
the
*NL*
same
with
the
notions
in
religion
as
it
is
with
math
`
matics
--
a
man
may
*NL*
be
able
to
work
problems
straight
off
in
's
head
as
he
sits
by
the
fire
*NL*
and
smokes
his
pipe
,
but
if
he
has
to
make
a
machine
or
a
building
,
he
*NL*
must
have
a
will
and
a
resolution
and
love
something
else
better
than
*NL*
his
own
ease
.
Somehow
,
the
congregation
began
to
fall
off
,
and
people
*NL*
began
to
speak
light
o
'
Mr.
Ryde
.
I
believe
he
meant
right
at
bottom
;
*NL*
but
,
you
see
,
he
was
sourish-tempered
,
and
was
for
beating
down
prices
*NL*
with
the
people
as
worked
for
him
;
and
his
preaching
would
n't
go
down
*NL*
well
with
that
sauce
.
And
he
wanted
to
be
like
my
lord
judge
i
'
the
*NL*
parish
,
punishing
folks
for
doing
wrong
;
and
he
scolded
'em
from
*NL*
the
pulpit
as
if
he
'd
been
a
Ranter
,
and
yet
he
could
n't
abide
the
*NL*
Dissenters
,
and
was
a
deal
more
set
against
'em
than
Mr.
Irwine
was
.
And
*NL*
then
he
did
n't
keep
within
his
income
,
for
he
seemed
to
think
at
first
*NL*
go-off
that
six
hundred
a-year
was
to
make
him
as
big
a
man
as
Mr.
*NL*
Donnithorne
.
That
's
a
sore
mischief
I
've
often
seen
with
the
poor
*NL*
curates
jumping
into
a
bit
of
a
living
all
of
a
sudden
.
Mr.
Ryde
was
a
*NL*
deal
thought
on
at
a
distance
,
I
believe
,
and
he
wrote
books
,
but
as
for
*NL*
math
`
matics
and
the
natur
o
'
things
,
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
woman
.
He
*NL*
was
very
knowing
about
doctrines
,
and
used
to
call
'em
the
bulwarks
of
*NL*
the
Reformation
;
but
I
've
always
mistrusted
that
sort
o
'
learning
as
*NL*
leaves
folks
foolish
and
unreasonable
about
business
.
Now
Mester
Irwine
*NL*
was
as
different
as
could
be
:
as
quick
!
--
he
understood
what
you
meant
in
*NL*
a
minute
,
and
he
knew
all
about
building
,
and
could
see
when
you
'd
made
*NL*
a
good
job
.
And
he
behaved
as
much
like
a
gentleman
to
the
farmers
,
and
*NL*
th
'
old
women
,
and
the
labourers
,
as
he
did
to
the
gentry
.
You
never
saw
*NL*
HIM
interfering
and
scolding
,
and
trying
to
play
th
'
emperor
.
Ah
,
he
was
*NL*
a
fine
man
as
ever
you
set
eyes
on
;
and
so
kind
to
's
mother
and
sisters
.
*NL*
That
poor
sickly
Miss
Anne
--
he
seemed
to
think
more
of
her
than
of
*NL*
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
There
was
n't
a
soul
in
the
parish
had
a
word
*NL*
to
say
against
him
;
and
his
servants
stayed
with
him
till
they
were
so
*NL*
old
and
pottering
,
he
had
to
hire
other
folks
to
do
their
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
was
an
excellent
way
of
preaching
in
the
weekdays
;
*NL*
but
I
daresay
,
if
your
old
friend
Mr.
Irwine
were
to
come
to
life
again
,
*NL*
and
get
into
the
pulpit
next
Sunday
,
you
would
be
rather
ashamed
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
preach
better
after
all
your
praise
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Adam
,
broadening
his
chest
and
throwing
himself
back
in
*NL*
his
chair
,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
meet
all
inferences
,
``
nobody
has
ever
*NL*
heard
me
say
Mr.
Irwine
was
much
of
a
preacher
.
He
did
n't
go
into
deep
*NL*
speritial
experience
;
and
I
know
there
s
a
deal
in
a
man
's
inward
life
*NL*
as
you
ca
n't
measure
by
the
square
,
and
say
,
`
Do
this
and
that
'll
*NL*
follow
,
'
and
,
`
Do
that
and
this
'll
follow
.
'
There
's
things
go
on
in
the
*NL*
soul
,
and
times
when
feelings
come
into
you
like
a
rushing
mighty
wind
,
*NL*
as
the
Scripture
says
,
and
part
your
life
in
two
a
`
most
,
so
you
look
*NL*
back
on
yourself
as
if
you
was
somebody
else
.
Those
are
things
as
you
*NL*
ca
n't
bottle
up
in
a
`
do
this
'
and
`
do
that
'
;
and
I
'll
go
so
far
with
*NL*
the
strongest
Methodist
ever
you
'll
find
.
That
shows
me
there
's
deep
*NL*
speritial
things
in
religion
.
You
ca
n't
make
much
out
wi
'
talking
about
*NL*
it
,
but
you
feel
it
.
Mr.
Irwine
did
n't
go
into
those
things
--
he
preached
*NL*
short
moral
sermons
,
and
that
was
all
.
But
then
he
acted
pretty
much
*NL*
up
to
what
he
said
;
he
did
n't
set
up
for
being
so
different
from
other
*NL*
folks
one
day
,
and
then
be
as
like
'em
as
two
peas
the
next
.
And
he
*NL*
made
folks
love
him
and
respect
him
,
and
that
was
better
nor
stirring
*NL*
up
their
gall
wi
'
being
overbusy
.
Mrs.
Poyser
used
to
say
--
you
know
she
*NL*
would
have
her
word
about
everything
--
she
said
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
like
a
*NL*
good
meal
o
'
victual
,
you
were
the
better
for
him
without
thinking
on
*NL*
it
,
and
Mr.
Ryde
was
like
a
dose
o
'
physic
,
he
gripped
you
and
worreted
*NL*
you
,
and
after
all
he
left
you
much
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
n't
Mr.
Ryde
preach
a
great
deal
more
about
that
spiritual
part
*NL*
of
religion
that
you
talk
of
,
Adam
?
Could
n't
you
get
more
out
of
his
*NL*
sermons
than
out
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
knowna
.
He
preached
a
deal
about
doctrines
.
But
I
've
seen
pretty
*NL*
clear
,
ever
since
I
was
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
*NL*
doctrines
and
notions
.
I
look
at
it
as
if
the
doctrines
was
like
finding
*NL*
names
for
your
feelings
,
so
as
you
can
talk
of
'em
when
you
've
never
*NL*
known
'em
,
just
as
a
man
may
talk
o
'
tools
when
he
knows
their
names
,
*NL*
though
he
's
never
so
much
as
seen
'em
,
still
less
handled
'em
.
I
've
*NL*
heard
a
deal
o
'
doctrine
i
'
my
time
,
for
I
used
to
go
after
the
*NL*
Dissenting
preachers
along
wi
'
Seth
,
when
I
was
a
lad
o
'
seventeen
,
and
*NL*
got
puzzling
myself
a
deal
about
th
'
Arminians
and
the
Calvinists
.
The
*NL*
Wesleyans
,
you
know
,
are
strong
Arminians
;
and
Seth
,
who
could
never
*NL*
abide
anything
harsh
and
was
always
for
hoping
the
best
,
held
fast
by
*NL*
the
Wesleyans
from
the
very
first
;
but
I
thought
I
could
pick
a
hole
or
*NL*
two
in
their
notions
,
and
I
got
disputing
wi
'
one
o
'
the
class
leaders
*NL*
down
at
Treddles
`
on
,
and
harassed
him
so
,
first
o
'
this
side
and
then
*NL*
o
'
that
,
till
at
last
he
said
,
`
Young
man
,
it
's
the
devil
making
use
o
'
*NL*
your
pride
and
conceit
as
a
weapon
to
war
against
the
simplicity
o
'
*NL*
the
truth
.
'
I
could
n't
help
laughing
then
,
but
as
I
was
going
home
,
I
*NL*
thought
the
man
was
n't
far
wrong
.
I
began
to
see
as
all
this
weighing
*NL*
and
sifting
what
this
text
means
and
that
text
means
,
and
whether
folks
*NL*
are
saved
all
by
God
's
grace
,
or
whether
there
goes
an
ounce
o
'
their
*NL*
own
will
to
`
t
,
was
no
part
o
'
real
religion
at
all
.
You
may
talk
o
'
*NL*
these
things
for
hours
on
end
,
and
you
'll
only
be
all
the
more
coxy
and
*NL*
conceited
for
`
t
.
So
I
took
to
going
nowhere
but
to
church
,
and
hearing
*NL*
nobody
but
Mr.
Irwine
,
for
he
said
nothing
but
what
was
good
and
what
*NL*
you
'd
be
the
wiser
for
remembering
.
And
I
found
it
better
for
my
soul
*NL*
to
be
humble
before
the
mysteries
o
'
God
's
dealings
,
and
not
be
making
*NL*
a
clatter
about
what
I
could
never
understand
.
And
they
're
poor
foolish
*NL*
questions
after
all
;
for
what
have
we
got
either
inside
or
outside
of
us
*NL*
but
what
comes
from
God
?
If
we
've
got
a
resolution
to
do
right
,
He
gave
*NL*
it
us
,
I
reckon
,
first
or
last
;
but
I
see
plain
enough
we
shall
never
do
*NL*
it
without
a
resolution
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
you
perceive
,
was
a
warm
admirer
,
perhaps
a
partial
judge
,
of
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
,
as
,
happily
,
some
of
us
still
are
of
the
people
we
have
known
*NL*
familiarly
.
Doubtless
it
will
be
despised
as
a
weakness
by
that
lofty
*NL*
order
of
minds
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
are
oppressed
by
a
general
*NL*
sense
that
their
emotions
are
of
too
exquisite
a
character
to
find
fit
*NL*
objects
among
their
everyday
fellowmen
.
I
have
often
been
favoured
with
*NL*
the
confidence
of
these
select
natures
,
and
find
them
to
concur
in
*NL*
the
experience
that
great
men
are
overestimated
and
small
men
are
*NL*
insupportable
;
that
if
you
would
love
a
woman
without
ever
looking
back
*NL*
on
your
love
as
a
folly
,
she
must
die
while
you
are
courting
her
;
and
if
*NL*
you
would
maintain
the
slightest
belief
in
human
heroism
,
you
must
never
*NL*
make
a
pilgrimage
to
see
the
hero
.
I
confess
I
have
often
meanly
shrunk
*NL*
from
confessing
to
these
accomplished
and
acute
gentlemen
what
my
own
*NL*
experience
has
been
.
I
am
afraid
I
have
often
smiled
with
hypocritical
*NL*
assent
,
and
gratified
them
with
an
epigram
on
the
fleeting
nature
of
our
*NL*
illusions
,
which
any
one
moderately
acquainted
with
French
literature
*NL*
can
command
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
Human
converse
,
I
think
some
wise
*NL*
man
has
remarked
,
is
not
rigidly
sincere
.
But
I
herewith
discharge
my
*NL*
conscience
,
and
declare
that
I
have
had
quite
enthusiastic
movements
of
*NL*
admiration
towards
old
gentlemen
who
spoke
the
worst
English
,
who
were
*NL*
occasionally
fretful
in
their
temper
,
and
who
had
never
moved
in
a
*NL*
higher
sphere
of
influence
than
that
of
parish
overseer
;
and
that
*NL*
the
way
in
which
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
human
nature
is
*NL*
lovable
--
the
way
I
have
learnt
something
of
its
deep
pathos
,
its
sublime
*NL*
mysteries
--
has
been
by
living
a
great
deal
among
people
more
or
less
*NL*
commonplace
and
vulgar
,
of
whom
you
would
perhaps
hear
nothing
very
*NL*
surprising
if
you
were
to
inquire
about
them
in
the
neighbourhoods
where
*NL*
they
dwelt
.
Ten
to
one
most
of
the
small
shopkeepers
in
their
vicinity
*NL*
saw
nothing
at
all
in
them
.
For
I
have
observed
this
remarkable
*NL*
coincidence
,
that
the
select
natures
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
*NL*
find
nothing
in
pantaloons
or
petticoats
great
enough
to
command
their
*NL*
reverence
and
love
,
are
curiously
in
unison
with
the
narrowest
and
*NL*
pettiest
.
For
example
,
I
have
often
heard
Mr.
Gedge
,
the
landlord
of
*NL*
the
Royal
Oak
,
who
used
to
turn
a
bloodshot
eye
on
his
neighbours
in
*NL*
the
village
of
Shepperton
,
sum
up
his
opinion
of
the
people
in
his
own
*NL*
parish
--
and
they
were
all
the
people
he
knew
--
in
these
emphatic
words
:
*NL*
``
Aye
,
sir
,
I
've
said
it
often
,
and
I
'll
say
it
again
,
they
're
a
poor
lot
*NL*
i
'
this
parish
--
a
poor
lot
,
sir
,
big
and
little
.
''
I
think
he
had
a
*NL*
dim
idea
that
if
he
could
migrate
to
a
distant
parish
,
he
might
find
*NL*
neighbours
worthy
of
him
;
and
indeed
he
did
subsequently
transfer
*NL*
himself
to
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
which
was
doing
a
thriving
business
in
*NL*
the
back
street
of
a
neighbouring
market-town
.
But
,
oddly
enough
,
he
has
*NL*
found
the
people
up
that
back
street
of
precisely
the
same
stamp
as
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
Shepperton
--
``
a
poor
lot
,
sir
,
big
and
little
,
and
them
*NL*
as
comes
for
a
go
o
'
gin
are
no
better
than
them
as
comes
for
a
pint
o
'
*NL*
twopenny
--
a
poor
lot

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Hetty
,
``
I
ca
n't
be
ready
so
soon
as
everybody
else
,
*NL*
when
I
've
got
Totty
's
things
to
put
on
.
And
I
'd
ever
such
work
to
make
*NL*
her
stand
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
coming
downstairs
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
,
in
her
plain
bonnet
and
*NL*
shawl
,
was
standing
below
.
If
ever
a
girl
looked
as
if
she
had
been
made
*NL*
of
roses
,
that
girl
was
Hetty
in
her
Sunday
hat
and
frock
.
For
her
hat
*NL*
was
trimmed
with
pink
,
and
her
frock
had
pink
spots
,
sprinkled
on
a
*NL*
white
ground
.
There
was
nothing
but
pink
and
white
about
her
,
except
*NL*
in
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
her
little
buckled
shoes
.
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
was
provoked
at
herself
,
for
she
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
,
as
any
*NL*
mortal
is
inclined
to
do
at
the
sight
of
pretty
round
things
.
So
she
*NL*
turned
without
speaking
,
and
joined
the
group
outside
the
house
door
,
*NL*
followed
by
Hetty
,
whose
heart
was
fluttering
so
at
the
thought
of
some
*NL*
one
she
expected
to
see
at
church
that
she
hardly
felt
the
ground
she
*NL*
trod
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
little
procession
set
off
.
Mr.
Poyser
was
in
his
Sunday
suit
*NL*
of
drab
,
with
a
red-and-green
waistcoat
and
a
green
watch-ribbon
having
*NL*
a
large
cornelian
seal
attached
,
pendant
like
a
plumb-line
from
that
*NL*
promontory
where
his
watch-pocket
was
situated
;
a
silk
handkerchief
of
a
*NL*
yellow
tone
round
his
neck
;
and
excellent
grey
ribbed
stockings
,
knitted
*NL*
by
Mrs.
Poyser
's
own
hand
,
setting
off
the
proportions
of
his
leg
.
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
had
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
leg
,
and
suspected
that
the
*NL*
growing
abuse
of
top-boots
and
other
fashions
tending
to
disguise
the
*NL*
nether
limbs
had
their
origin
in
a
pitiable
degeneracy
of
the
human
*NL*
calf
.
Still
less
had
he
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
round
jolly
face
,
*NL*
which
was
good
humour
itself
as
he
said
,
``
Come
,
Hetty
--
come
,
little
*NL*
uns
!
''
and
giving
his
arm
to
his
wife
,
led
the
way
through
the
causeway
*NL*
gate
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
little
uns
''
addressed
were
Marty
and
Tommy
,
boys
of
nine
and
seven
,
*NL*
in
little
fustian
tailed
coats
and
knee-breeches
,
relieved
by
rosy
*NL*
cheeks
and
black
eyes
,
looking
as
much
like
their
father
as
a
very
small
*NL*
elephant
is
like
a
very
large
one
.
Hetty
walked
between
them
,
and
behind
*NL*
came
patient
Molly
,
whose
task
it
was
to
carry
Totty
through
the
yard
*NL*
and
over
all
the
wet
places
on
the
road
;
for
Totty
,
having
speedily
*NL*
recovered
from
her
threatened
fever
,
had
insisted
on
going
to
church
*NL*
to-day
,
and
especially
on
wearing
her
red-and-black
necklace
outside
her
*NL*
tippet
.
And
there
were
many
wet
places
for
her
to
be
carried
over
this
*NL*
afternoon
,
for
there
had
been
heavy
showers
in
the
morning
,
though
now
*NL*
the
clouds
had
rolled
off
and
lay
in
towering
silvery
masses
on
the
*NL*
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
might
have
known
it
was
Sunday
if
you
had
only
waked
up
in
the
*NL*
farmyard
.
The
cocks
and
hens
seemed
to
know
it
,
and
made
only
crooning
*NL*
subdued
noises
;
the
very
bull-dog
looked
less
savage
,
as
if
he
would
*NL*
have
been
satisfied
with
a
smaller
bite
than
usual
.
The
sunshine
seemed
*NL*
to
call
all
things
to
rest
and
not
to
labour
.
It
was
asleep
itself
on
*NL*
the
moss-grown
cow-shed
;
on
the
group
of
white
ducks
nestling
together
*NL*
with
their
bills
tucked
under
their
wings
;
on
the
old
black
sow
*NL*
stretched
languidly
on
the
straw
,
while
her
largest
young
one
found
an
*NL*
excellent
spring-bed
on
his
mother
's
fat
ribs
;
on
Alick
,
the
shepherd
,
*NL*
in
his
new
smock-frock
,
taking
an
uneasy
siesta
,
half-sitting
,
*NL*
half-standing
on
the
granary
steps
.
Alick
was
of
opinion
that
church
,
*NL*
like
other
luxuries
,
was
not
to
be
indulged
in
often
by
a
foreman
who
*NL*
had
the
weather
and
the
ewes
on
his
mind
.
``
Church
!
Nay
--
I
'n
gotten
*NL*
summat
else
to
think
on
,
''
was
an
answer
which
he
often
uttered
in
a
tone
*NL*
of
bitter
significance
that
silenced
further
question
.
I
feel
sure
*NL*
Alick
meant
no
irreverence
;
indeed
,
I
know
that
his
mind
was
not
of
a
*NL*
speculative
,
negative
cast
,
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
missed
going
*NL*
to
church
on
Christmas
Day
,
Easter
Sunday
,
and
``
Whissuntide
.
''
But
he
had
*NL*
a
general
impression
that
public
worship
and
religious
ceremonies
,
*NL*
like
other
non-productive
employments
,
were
intended
for
people
who
had
*NL*
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Father
a-standing
at
the
yard-gate
,
''
said
Martin
Poyser
.
``
I
*NL*
reckon
he
wants
to
watch
us
down
the
field
.
It
's
wonderful
what
sight
he
*NL*
has
,
and
him
turned
seventy-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
often
think
it
's
wi
'
th
'
old
folks
as
it
is
wi
'
the
babbies
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Poyser
;
``
they
're
satisfied
wi
'
looking
,
no
matter
what
they
're
*NL*
looking
at
.
It
's
God
A'mighty
's
way
o
'
quietening
'em
,
I
reckon
,
afore
*NL*
they
go
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Martin
opened
the
gate
as
he
saw
the
family
procession
approaching
,
*NL*
and
held
it
wide
open
,
leaning
on
his
stick
--
pleased
to
do
this
bit
*NL*
of
work
;
for
,
like
all
old
men
whose
life
has
been
spent
in
labour
,
he
*NL*
liked
to
feel
that
he
was
still
useful
--
that
there
was
a
better
crop
of
*NL*
onions
in
the
garden
because
he
was
by
at
the
sowing
--
and
that
the
cows
*NL*
would
be
milked
the
better
if
he
stayed
at
home
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
*NL*
to
look
on
.
He
always
went
to
church
on
Sacrament
Sundays
,
but
not
very
*NL*
regularly
at
other
times
;
on
wet
Sundays
,
or
whenever
he
had
a
touch
of
*NL*
rheumatism
,
he
used
to
read
the
three
first
chapters
of
Genesis
instead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
ha
'
putten
Thias
Bede
i
'
the
ground
afore
ye
get
to

churchyard

''
he
said
,
as
his
son
came
up
.
``
It
`
ud
ha
'
been
better
luck
*NL*
if
they
'd
ha

buried

when

rain
was

;
*NL*
there
's
no
likelihoods
of
a

now
;
an

the
moon
lies
like

That
's
a
sure
sign
o

fair
weather

is
false
but
that
's
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,

said
the
son
,
``
I
'm
in
hopes
it
'll
hold
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind

mind
what
the
parson
says

said
*NL*
Grandfather
to
the
black-eyed
youngsters
in
knee-breeches
,
conscious
of
*NL*
a
marble
or
two
in
their
pockets
which
they
looked
forward
to
handling
,
*NL*
a
little
,
secretly
,
during
the
sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dood-bye
,
Dandad
,
''
said
Totty
.
``
Me
doin
'
to
church
.
Me
dot
my
neklace
*NL*
on
.
Dive
me
a
peppermint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grandad
,
shaking
with
laughter
at
this
``
deep
little
wench
,
''
slowly
*NL*
transferred
his
stick
to
his
left
hand
,
which
held
the
gate
open
,
and
*NL*
slowly
thrust
his
finger
into
the
waistcoat
pocket
on
which
Totty
had
*NL*
fixed
her
eyes
with
a
confident
look
of
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
they
were
all
gone
,
the
old
man
leaned
on
the
gate
again
,
*NL*
watching
them
across
the
lane
along
the
Home
Close
,
and
through
the
*NL*
far
gate
,
till
they
disappeared
behind
a
bend
in
the
hedge
.
For
the
*NL*
hedgerows
in
those
days
shut
out
one
's
view
,
even
on
the
better-managed
*NL*
farms
;
and
this
afternoon
,
the
dog-roses
were
tossing
out
their
pink
*NL*
wreaths
,
the
nightshade
was
in
its
yellow
and
purple
glory
,
the
pale
*NL*
honeysuckle
grew
out
of
reach
,
peeping
high
up
out
of
a
holly
bush
,
and
*NL*
over
all
an
ash
or
a
sycamore
every
now
and
then
threw
its
shadow
across
*NL*
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
acquaintances
at
other
gates
who
had
to
move
aside
and
let
*NL*
them
pass
:
at
the
gate
of
the
Home
Close
there
was
half
the
dairy
of
*NL*
cows
standing
one
behind
the
other
,
extremely
slow
to
understand
that
*NL*
their
large
bodies
might
be
in
the
way
;
at
the
far
gate
there
was
the
*NL*
mare
holding
her
head
over
the
bars
,
and
beside
her
the
liver-coloured
*NL*
foal
with
its
head
towards
its
mother
's
flank
,
apparently
still
much
*NL*
embarrassed
by
its
own
straddling
existence
.
The
way
lay
entirely
*NL*
through
Mr.
Poyser
's
own
fields
till
they
reached
the
main
road
leading
*NL*
to
the
village
,
and
he
turned
a
keen
eye
on
the
stock
and
the
crops
*NL*
as
they
went
along
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
was
ready
to
supply
a
running
*NL*
commentary
on
them
all
.
The
woman
who
manages
a
dairy
has
a
large
share
*NL*
in
making
the
rent
,
so
she
may
well
be
allowed
to
have
her
opinion
on
*NL*
stock
and
their
``
keep
''
--
an
exercise
which
strengthens
her
understanding
*NL*
so
much
that
she
finds
herself
able
to
give
her
husband
advice
on
most
*NL*
other
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
that
shorthorned
Sally
,
''
she
said
,
as
they
entered
the
Home
*NL*
Close
,
and
she
caught
sight
of
the
meek
beast
that
lay
chewing
the
cud
*NL*
and
looking
at
her
with
a
sleepy
eye

``
I
begin
to
hate

I
say
now
what
I
said
three
weeks
ago
,
the
sooner
we
get
rid
of

the
better

there

that

then
wonder

Mr.

had
more

boasted
of

Mrs.

who
had
been
set
down
now
the
road
was
dry

settled

a

niver

Sitting

still
at

sewing
as

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
Mr.

with
as
near
an
approach
to
a
snarl
as
his
*NL*
good-nature
would
allow
;
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

goodness

''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
looked
back
while
her
*NL*
husband
was
speaking
,
``
look
where
Molly
is
with

lads

They
're

*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
were
now
at
the
end
of
the
second
field
,
so
they
set
*NL*
Totty
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
large
stones
forming
the
true
Loamshire
*NL*
stile
,
and
awaited
the
loiterers

observing
with
complacency
,
``

The
fact
was
that
this
Sunday
walk
through
the
fields
was
fraught
with
*NL*
great
excitement
to
Marty
and
Tommy
,
who
saw
a
perpetual
drama
going
on
*NL*
in
the
hedgerows
,
and
could
no
more
refrain
from
stopping
and
peeping
*NL*
than
if
they
had
been
a
couple
of
spaniels
or
terriers
.
Marty
was
quite
*NL*
sure
he
saw
a
yellow-hammer
on
the
boughs
of
the
great
ash
,
and
while
*NL*
he
was
peeping
,
he
missed
the
sight
of
a
white-throated
stoat
,
which
had
*NL*
run
across
the
path
and
was
described
with
much
fervour
by
the
junior
*NL*
Tommy
.
Then
there
was
a
little
greenfinch
,
just
fledged
,
fluttering
*NL*
along
the
ground
,
and
it
seemed
quite
possible
to
catch
it
,
till
it
*NL*
managed
to
flutter
under
the
blackberry
bush
.
Hetty
could
not
be
got
*NL*
to
give
any
heed
to
these
things
,
so
Molly
was
called
on
for
her
ready
*NL*
sympathy
,
and
peeped
with
open
mouth
wherever
she
was
told
,
and
said
*NL*
``
Lawks
!
''
whenever
she
was
expected
to
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
hastened
on
with
some
alarm
when
Hetty
had
come
back
and
called
to
*NL*
them
that
her
aunt
was
angry
;
but
Marty
ran
on
first
,
shouting
,
*NL*
``
We
've
found
the
speckled
turkey
's
nest
,
Mother
!
''
with
the
instinctive
*NL*
confidence
that
people
who
bring
good
news
are
never
in
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
really
forgetting
all
discipline
in
this
*NL*
pleasant
surprise
,
``
that
's
a
good
lad
;
why
,
where
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
in
ever
such
a
hole
,
under
the
hedge

I
saw
it
first

looking
*NL*
after

greenfinch
,
and
she
sat
on
th

nest

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

went
away
as
still
as
still

whispered
to
Molly

Molly
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well
,
now

on

Mrs.
Poyser
,
``
and
walk
before
Father

*NL*
Mother

and
take

little
sister
by

hand

must
go
straight
on

now

boys

look
after
the
birds
of

Sunday

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

said
Marty
,
``

said

'd
give
half-a-crown

May

have
the
half-crown
put
into

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
see
about
that

if
you
walk
along
now

like

*NL*
*NL*
The
father
and
mother
exchanged
a
significant
glance
of
amusement
at
*NL*
their
eldest-born
's
acuteness
;
but
on
Tommy
's
round
face
there
was
a
*NL*
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
half-crying
,
``
Marty
's
got
ever
so
much
more
money
in
*NL*
his
box
nor
I
've
got
in
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Totty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush

hush

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
``
did
ever
anybody
hear
such
*NL*
naughty
children

Nobody

ever
see
their

they

make
haste

*NL*
*NL*
This
dreadful
threat
had
the
desired
effect
,
and
through
the
two
*NL*
remaining
fields
the
three
pair
of
small
legs
trotted
on
without
any
*NL*
serious
interruption
,
notwithstanding
a
small
pond
full
of
tadpoles
,
*NL*
alias
``
bullheads
,
''
which
the
lads
looked
at
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
damp
hay
that
must
be
scattered
and
turned
afresh
to-morrow
was
*NL*
not
a
cheering
sight
to
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
during
hay
and
corn
harvest
had
*NL*
often
some
mental
struggles
as
to
the
benefits
of
a
day
of
rest
;
but
no
*NL*
temptation
would
have
induced
him
to
carry
on
any
field-work
,
however
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
,
on
a
Sunday
;
for
had
not
Michael
Holdsworth
had
a
*NL*
pair
of
oxen
``
sweltered
''
while
he
was
ploughing
on
Good
Friday
?
That
was
*NL*
a
demonstration
that
work
on
sacred
days
was
a
wicked
thing
;
and
with
*NL*
wickedness
of
any
sort
Martin
Poyser
was
quite
clear
that
he
would
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
,
since
money
got
by
such
means
would
never
prosper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
a
`
most
makes
your
fingers
itch
to
be
at
the
hay
now
the
sun
shines

he
observed
,
as
they
passed
through
the
``
Big
Meadow

``
But
it

Sunday
as
o
'
weekdays
,
and
took
no
heed
to
*NL*
right
or
wrong
,
as
if
there
was
nayther
God
nor
devil
.
An
'
what
's
he
*NL*
come
to
?
Why
,
I
saw
him
myself
last
market-day
a-carrying
a
basket
wi
'
*NL*
oranges
i
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
emphatically
,
``
you
make
but
a
poor
*NL*
trap
to
catch
luck
if
you
go
and
bait
it
wi
'
wickedness
.
The
money
as
is
*NL*
got
so
's
like
to
burn
holes
i
'
your
pocket
.
I
'd
niver
wish
us
to
leave
*NL*
our
lads
a
sixpence
but
what
was
got
i
'
the
rightful
way
.
And
as
for
*NL*
the
weather
,
there
's
One
above
makes
it
,
and
we
must
put
up
wi
`
t
:
it
's
*NL*
nothing
of
a
plague
to
what
the
wenches
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
interruption
in
their
walk
,
the
excellent
habit
*NL*
which
Mrs.
Poyser
's
clock
had
of
taking
time
by
the
forelock
had
secured
*NL*
their
arrival
at
the
village
while
it
was
still
a
quarter
to
two
,
*NL*
though
almost
every
one
who
meant
to
go
to
church
was
already
within
the
*NL*
churchyard
gates
.
Those
who
stayed
at
home
were
chiefly
mothers
,
like
*NL*
Timothy
's
Bess
,
who
stood
at
her
own
door
nursing
her
baby
and
feeling
*NL*
as
women
feel
in
that
position
--
that
nothing
else
can
be
expected
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
entirely
to
see
Thias
Bede
's
funeral
that
the
people
were
*NL*
standing
about
the
churchyard
so
long
before
service
began
;
that
was
*NL*
their
common
practice
.
The
women
,
indeed
,
usually
entered
the
church
at
*NL*
once
,
and
the
farmers
'
wives
talked
in
an
undertone
to
each
other
,
over
*NL*
the
tall
pews
,
about
their
illnesses
and
the
total
failure
of
doctor
's
*NL*
stuff
,
recommending
dandelion-tea
,
and
other
home-made
specifics
,
as
*NL*
far
preferable
--
about
the
servants
,
and
their
growing
exorbitance
as
to
*NL*
wages
,
whereas
the
quality
of
their
services
declined
from
year
to
year
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
girl
nowadays
to
be
trusted
any
further
than
you
could
*NL*
see
her
--
about
the
bad
price
Mr.
Dingall
,
the
Treddleston
grocer
,
was
*NL*
giving
for
butter
,
and
the
reasonable
doubts
that
might
be
held
as
to
*NL*
his
solvency
,
notwithstanding
that
Mrs.
Dingall
was
a
sensible
woman
,
*NL*
and
they
were
all
sorry
for
HER
,
for
she
had
very
good
kin
.
Meantime
the
*NL*
men
lingered
outside
,
and
hardly
any
of
them
except
the
singers
,
who
had
*NL*
a
humming
and
fragmentary
rehearsal
to
go
through
,
entered
the
church
*NL*
until
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
desk
.
They
saw
no
reason
for
that
premature
*NL*
entrance
--
what
could
they
do
in
church
if
they
were
there
before
service
*NL*
began
?
--
and
they
did
not
conceive
that
any
power
in
the
universe
*NL*
could
take
it
ill
of
them
if
they
stayed
out
and
talked
a
little
about
*NL*
``
bus
`
ness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
Cranage
looks
like
quite
a
new
acquaintance
to-day
,
for
he
has
got
*NL*
his
clean
Sunday
face
,
which
always
makes
his
little
granddaughter
cry
*NL*
at
him
as
a
stranger
.
But
an
experienced
eye
would
have
fixed
on
him
at
*NL*
once
as
the
village
blacksmith
,
after
seeing
the
humble
deference
with
*NL*
which
the
big
saucy
fellow
took
off
his
hat
and
stroked
his
hair
to
the
*NL*
farmers
;
for
Chad
was
accustomed
to
say
that
a
working-man
must
hold
*NL*
a
candle
to
a
personage
understood
to
be
as
black
as
he
was
himself
*NL*
on
weekdays
;
by
which
evil-sounding
rule
of
conduct
he
meant
what
was
,
*NL*
after
all
,
rather
virtuous
than
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
men
who
had
*NL*
horses
to
be
shod
must
be
treated
with
respect
.
Chad
and
the
rougher
*NL*
sort
of
workmen
kept
aloof
from
the
grave
under
the
white
thorn
,
*NL*
where
the
burial
was
going
forward
;
but
Sandy
Jim
,
and
several
of
the
*NL*
farm-labourers
,
made
a
group
round
it
,
and
stood
with
their
hats
off
,
as
*NL*
fellow-mourners
with
the
mother
and
sons
.
Others
held
a
midway
position
,
*NL*
sometimes
watching
the
group
at
the
grave
,
sometimes
listening
to
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
farmers
,
who
stood
in
a
knot
near
the
church
door
,
*NL*
and
were
now
joined
by
Martin
Poyser
,
while
his
family
passed
into
the
*NL*
church
.
On
the
outside
of
this
knot
stood
Mr.
Casson
,
the
landlord
of
*NL*
the
Donnithorne
Arms
,
in
his
most
striking
attitude
--
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
thrust
between
the
buttons
of
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
his
left
hand
in
his
breeches
pocket
,
and
his
head
very
*NL*
much
on
one
side
;
looking
,
on
the
whole
,
like
an
actor
who
has
only
a
*NL*
mono-syllabic
part
entrusted
to
him
,
but
feels
sure
that
the
audience
*NL*
discern
his
fitness
for
the
leading
business
;
curiously
in
contrast
with
*NL*
old
Jonathan
Burge
,
who
held
his
hands
behind
him
and
leaned
forward
,
*NL*
coughing
asthmatically
,
with
an
inward
scorn
of
all
knowingness
that
*NL*
could
not
be
turned
into
cash
.
The
talk
was
in
rather
a
lower
tone
than
*NL*
usual
to-day
,
hushed
a
little
by
the
sound
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
reading
*NL*
the
final
prayers
of
the
burial-service
.
They
had
all
had
their
word
*NL*
of
pity
for
poor
Thias
,
but
now
they
had
got
upon
the
nearer
subject
of
*NL*
their
own
grievances
against
Satchell
,
the
Squire
's
bailiff
,
who
*NL*
played
the
part
of
steward
so
far
as
it
was
not
performed
by
old
Mr.
*NL*
Donnithorne
himself
,
for
that
gentleman
had
the
meanness
to
receive
*NL*
his
own
rents
and
make
bargains
about
his
own
timber
.
This
subject
of
*NL*
conversation
was
an
additional
reason
for
not
being
loud
,
since
Satchell
*NL*
himself
might
presently
be
walking
up
the
paved
road
to
the
church
door
.
*NL*
And
soon
they
became
suddenly
silent
;
for
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
had
ceased
,
*NL*
and
the
group
round
the
white
thorn
was
dispersing
itself
towards
the
*NL*
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
moved
aside
,
and
stood
with
their
hats
off
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
passed
.
Adam
and
Seth
were
coming
next
,
with
their
mother
between
them
;
*NL*
for
Joshua
Rann
officiated
as
head
sexton
as
well
as
clerk
,
and
was
not
*NL*
yet
ready
to
follow
the
rector
into
the
vestry
.
But
there
was
a
pause
*NL*
before
the
three
mourners
came
on
:
Lisbeth
had
turned
round
to
look
*NL*
again
towards
the
grave
!
Ah
!
There
was
nothing
now
but
the
brown
earth
*NL*
under
the
white
thorn
.
Yet
she
cried
less
to-day
than
she
had
done
any
*NL*
day
since
her
husband
's
death
.
Along
with
all
her
grief
there
was
mixed
*NL*
an
unusual
sense
of
her
own
importance
in
having
a
``
burial
,
''
and
in
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
's
reading
a
special
service
for
her
husband
;
and
besides
,
she
*NL*
knew
the
funeral
psalm
was
going
to
be
sung
for
him
.
She
felt
this
*NL*
counter-excitement
to
her
sorrow
still
more
strongly
as
she
walked
with
*NL*
her
sons
towards
the
church
door
,
and
saw
the
friendly
sympathetic
nods
*NL*
of
their
fellow-parishioners
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
and
sons
passed
into
the
church
,
and
one
by
one
the
*NL*
loiterers
followed
,
though
some
still
lingered
without
;
the
sight
of
Mr.
*NL*
Donnithorne
's
carriage
,
which
was
winding
slowly
up
the
hill
,
perhaps
*NL*
helping
to
make
them
feel
that
there
was
no
need
for
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
the
sound
of
the
bassoon
and
the
key-bugles
burst
forth
;
*NL*
the
evening
hymn
,
which
always
opened
the
service
,
had
begun
,
and
every
*NL*
one
must
now
enter
and
take
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
that
the
interior
of
Hayslope
Church
was
remarkable
for
*NL*
anything
except
for
the
grey
age
of
its
oaken
pews
--
great
square
pews
*NL*
mostly
,
ranged
on
each
side
of
a
narrow
aisle
.
It
was
free
,
indeed
,
*NL*
from
the
modern
blemish
of
galleries
.
The
choir
had
two
narrow
pews
to
*NL*
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
right-hand
row
,
so
that
it
was
a
short
*NL*
process
for
Joshua
Rann
to
take
his
place
among
them
as
principal
bass
,
*NL*
and
return
to
his
desk
after
the
singing
was
over
.
The
pulpit
and
desk
,
*NL*
grey
and
old
as
the
pews
,
stood
on
one
side
of
the
arch
leading
into
*NL*
the
chancel
,
which
also
had
its
grey
square
pews
for
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
*NL*
family
and
servants
.
Yet
I
assure
you
these
grey
pews
,
with
the
*NL*
buff-washed
walls
,
gave
a
very
pleasing
tone
to
this
shabby
interior
,
*NL*
and
agreed
extremely
well
with
the
ruddy
faces
and
bright
waistcoats
.
*NL*
And
there
were
liberal
touches
of
crimson
toward
the
chancel
,
for
*NL*
the
pulpit
and
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
own
pew
had
handsome
crimson
cloth
*NL*
cushions
;
and
,
to
close
the
vista
,
there
was
a
crimson
altar-cloth
,
*NL*
embroidered
with
golden
rays
by
Miss
Lydia
's
own
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
without
the
crimson
cloth
,
the
effect
must
have
been
warm
and
*NL*
cheering
when
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
desk
,
looking
benignly
round
on
*NL*
that
simple
congregation
--
on
the
hardy
old
men
,
with
bent
knees
and
*NL*
shoulders
,
perhaps
,
but
with
vigour
left
for
much
hedge-clipping
and
*NL*
thatching
;
on
the
tall
stalwart
frames
and
roughly
cut
bronzed
faces
of
*NL*
the
stone-cutters
and
carpenters
;
on
the
half-dozen
well-to-do
farmers
,
*NL*
with
their
apple-cheeked
families
;
and
on
the
clean
old
women
,
mostly
*NL*
farm-labourers
'
wives
,
with
their
bit
of
snow-white
cap-border
under
*NL*
their
black
bonnets
,
and
with
their
withered
arms
,
bare
from
the
elbow
,
*NL*
folded
passively
over
their
chests
.
For
none
of
the
old
people
held
*NL*
books
--
why
should
they
?
Not
one
of
them
could
read
.
But
they
knew
a
*NL*
few
``
good
words
''
by
heart
,
and
their
withered
lips
now
and
then
moved
*NL*
silently
,
following
the
service
without
any
very
clear
comprehension
*NL*
indeed
,
but
with
a
simple
faith
in
its
efficacy
to
ward
off
harm
and
*NL*
bring
blessing
.
And
now
all
faces
were
visible
,
for
all
were
standing
*NL*
up
--
the
little
children
on
the
seats
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
grey
*NL*
pews
,
while
good
Bishop
Ken
's
evening
hymn
was
being
sung
to
one
of
*NL*
those
lively
psalm-tunes
which
died
out
with
the
last
generation
of
*NL*
rectors
and
choral
parish
clerks
.
Melodies
die
out
,
like
the
pipe
of
*NL*
Pan
,
with
the
ears
that
love
them
and
listen
for
them
.
Adam
was
not
in
*NL*
his
usual
place
among
the
singers
to-day
,
for
he
sat
with
his
mother
*NL*
and
Seth
,
and
he
noticed
with
surprise
that
Bartle
Massey
was
absent
*NL*
too
--
all
the
more
agreeable
for
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
,
who
gave
out
his
bass
*NL*
notes
with
unusual
complacency
and
threw
an
extra
ray
of
severity
into
*NL*
the
glances
he
sent
over
his
spectacles
at
the
recusant
Will
Maskery
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
beseech
you
to
imagine
Mr.
Irwine
looking
round
on
this
scene
,
in
his
*NL*
ample
white
surplice
that
became
him
so
well
,
with
his
powdered
hair
*NL*
thrown
back
,
his
rich
brown
complexion
,
and
his
finely
cut
nostril
and
*NL*
upper
lip
;
for
there
was
a
certain
virtue
in
that
benignant
yet
keen
*NL*
countenance
as
there
is
in
all
human
faces
from
which
a
generous
soul
*NL*
beams
out
.
And
over
all
streamed
the
delicious
June
sunshine
through
the
*NL*
old
windows
,
with
their
desultory
patches
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
blue
,
that
*NL*
threw
pleasant
touches
of
colour
on
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
looked
round
to-day
,
his
eyes
rested
an
instant
*NL*
longer
than
usual
on
the
square
pew
occupied
by
Martin
Poyser
and
his
*NL*
family
.
And
there
was
another
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
found
it
impossible
*NL*
not
to
wander
thither
,
and
rest
on
that
round
pink-and-white
figure
.
But
*NL*
Hetty
was
at
that
moment
quite
careless
of
any
glances
--
she
was
absorbed
*NL*
in
the
thought
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
soon
be
coming
into
church
,
*NL*
for
the
carriage
must
surely
be
at
the
church-gate
by
this
time
.
She
*NL*
had
never
seen
him
since
she
parted
with
him
in
the
wood
on
Thursday
*NL*
evening
,
and
oh
,
how
long
the
time
had
seemed
!
Things
had
gone
on
just
*NL*
the
same
as
ever
since
that
evening
;
the
wonders
that
had
happened
then
*NL*
had
brought
no
changes
after
them
;
they
were
already
like
a
dream
.
When
*NL*
she
heard
the
church
door
swinging
,
her
heart
beat
so
,
she
dared
not
*NL*
look
up
.
She
felt
that
her
aunt
was
curtsying
;
she
curtsied
herself
.
*NL*
That
must
be
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
--
he
always
came
first
,
the
wrinkled
*NL*
small
old
man
,
peering
round
with
short-sighted
glances
at
the
bowing
*NL*
and
curtsying
congregation
;
then
she
knew
Miss
Lydia
was
passing
,
*NL*
and
though
Hetty
liked
so
much
to
look
at
her
fashionable
little
*NL*
coal-scuttle
bonnet
,
with
the
wreath
of
small
roses
round
it
,
she
did
n't
*NL*
mind
it
to-day
.
But
there
were
no
more
curtsies
--
no
,
he
was
not
come
;
*NL*
she
felt
sure
there
was
nothing
else
passing
the
pew
door
but
the
*NL*
house-keeper
's
black
bonnet
and
the
lady
's
maid
's
beautiful
straw
hat
*NL*
that
had
once
been
Miss
Lydia
's
,
and
then
the
powdered
heads
of
the
*NL*
butler
and
footman
.
No
,
he
was
not
there
;
yet
she
would
look
now
--
she
*NL*
might
be
mistaken
--
for
,
after
all
,
she
had
not
looked
.
So
she
lifted
*NL*
up
her
eyelids
and
glanced
timidly
at
the
cushioned
pew
in
the
*NL*
chancel
--
there
was
no
one
but
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
rubbing
his
spectacles
*NL*
with
his
white
handkerchief
,
and
Miss
Lydia
opening
the
large
gilt-edged
*NL*
prayer-book
.
The
chill
disappointment
was
too
hard
to
bear
.
She
felt
*NL*
herself
turning
pale
,
her
lips
trembling
;
she
was
ready
to
cry
.
Oh
,
what
*NL*
SHOULD
she
do
?
Everybody
would
know
the
reason
;
they
would
know
she
was
*NL*
crying
because
Arthur
was
not
there
.
And
Mr.
Craig
,
with
the
wonderful
*NL*
hothouse
plant
in
his
button-hole
,
was
staring
at
her
,
she
knew
.
It
was
*NL*
dreadfully
long
before
the
General
Confession
began
,
so
that
she
could
*NL*
kneel
down
.
Two
great
drops
WOULD
fall
then
,
but
no
one
saw
them
except
*NL*
good-natured
Molly
,
for
her
aunt
and
uncle
knelt
with
their
backs
*NL*
towards
her
.
Molly
,
unable
to
imagine
any
cause
for
tears
in
church
*NL*
except
faintness
,
of
which
she
had
a
vague
traditional
knowledge
,
drew
*NL*
out
of
her
pocket
a
queer
little
flat
blue
smelling-bottle
,
and
after
*NL*
much
labour
in
pulling
the
cork
out
,
thrust
the
narrow
neck
against
*NL*
Hetty
's
nostrils
.
``
It
donna
smell
,
''
she
whispered
,
thinking
this
was
a
*NL*
great
advantage
which
old
salts
had
over
fresh
ones
:
they
did
you
good
*NL*
without
biting
your
nose
.
Hetty
pushed
it
away
peevishly
;
but
this
*NL*
little
flash
of
temper
did
what
the
salts
could
not
have
done
--
it
roused
*NL*
her
to
wipe
away
the
traces
of
her
tears
,
and
try
with
all
her
might
*NL*
not
to
shed
any
more
.
Hetty
had
a
certain
strength
in
her
vain
little
*NL*
nature
:
she
would
have
borne
anything
rather
than
be
laughed
at
,
or
*NL*
pointed
at
with
any
other
feeling
than
admiration
;
she
would
have
*NL*
pressed
her
own
nails
into
her
tender
flesh
rather
than
people
should
*NL*
know
a
secret
she
did
not
want
them
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
fluctuations
there
were
in
her
busy
thoughts
and
feelings
,
while
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
was
pronouncing
the
solemn
``
Absolution
''
in
her
deaf
ears
,
and
*NL*
through
all
the
tones
of
petition
that
followed
!
Anger
lay
very
close
to
*NL*
disappointment
,
and
soon
won
the
victory
over
the
conjectures
her
*NL*
small
ingenuity
could
devise
to
account
for
Arthur
's
absence
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
he
really
wanted
to
come
,
really
wanted
to
see
her
*NL*
again
.
And
by
the
time
she
rose
from
her
knees
mechanically
,
because
all
*NL*
the
rest
were
rising
,
the
colour
had
returned
to
her
cheeks
even
with
*NL*
a
heightened
glow
,
for
she
was
framing
little
indignant
speeches
to
*NL*
herself
,
saying
she
hated
Arthur
for
giving
her
this
pain
--
she
would
*NL*
like
him
to
suffer
too
.
Yet
while
this
selfish
tumult
was
going
on
in
*NL*
her
soul
,
her
eyes
were
bent
down
on
her
prayer-book
,
and
the
eyelids
*NL*
with
their
dark
fringe
looked
as
lovely
as
ever
.
Adam
Bede
thought
so
,
*NL*
as
he
glanced
at
her
for
a
moment
on
rising
from
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Adam
's
thoughts
of
Hetty
did
not
deafen
him
to
the
service
;
they
*NL*
rather
blended
with
all
the
other
deep
feelings
for
which
the
church
*NL*
service
was
a
channel
to
him
this
afternoon
,
as
a
certain
consciousness
*NL*
of
our
entire
past
and
our
imagined
future
blends
itself
with
all
our
*NL*
moments
of
keen
sensibility
.
And
to
Adam
the
church
service
was
the
*NL*
best
channel
he
could
have
found
for
his
mingled
regret
,
yearning
,
and
*NL*
resignation
;
its
interchange
of
beseeching
cries
for
help
with
outbursts
*NL*
of
faith
and
praise
,
its
recurrent
responses
and
the
familiar
rhythm
of
*NL*
its
collects
,
seemed
to
speak
for
him
as
no
other
form
of
worship
could
*NL*
have
done
;
as
,
to
those
early
Christians
who
had
worshipped
from
their
*NL*
childhood
upwards
in
catacombs
,
the
torch-light
and
shadows
must
have
*NL*
seemed
nearer
the
Divine
presence
than
the
heathenish
daylight
of
the
*NL*
streets
.
The
secret
of
our
emotions
never
lies
in
the
bare
object
,
but
*NL*
in
its
subtle
relations
to
our
own
past
:
no
wonder
the
secret
escapes
*NL*
the
unsympathizing
observer
,
who
might
as
well
put
on
his
spectacles
to
*NL*
discern
odours
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
one
reason
why
even
a
chance
comer
would
have
found
the
*NL*
service
in
Hayslope
Church
more
impressive
than
in
most
other
village
*NL*
nooks
in
the
kingdom
--
a
reason
of
which
I
am
sure
you
have
not
the
*NL*
slightest
suspicion
.
It
was
the
reading
of
our
friend
Joshua
Rann
.
Where
*NL*
that
good
shoemaker
got
his
notion
of
reading
from
remained
a
mystery
*NL*
even
to
his
most
intimate
acquaintances
.
I
believe
,
after
all
,
he
got
it
*NL*
chiefly
from
Nature
,
who
had
poured
some
of
her
music
into
this
honest
*NL*
conceited
soul
,
as
she
had
been
known
to
do
into
other
narrow
souls
*NL*
before
his
.
She
had
given
him
,
at
least
,
a
fine
bass
voice
and
a
musical
*NL*
ear
;
but
I
can
not
positively
say
whether
these
alone
had
sufficed
to
*NL*
inspire
him
with
the
rich
chant
in
which
he
delivered
the
responses
.
*NL*
The
way
he
rolled
from
a
rich
deep
forte
into
a
melancholy
cadence
,
*NL*
subsiding
,
at
the
end
of
the
last
word
,
into
a
sort
of
faint
resonance
,
*NL*
like
the
lingering
vibrations
of
a
fine
violoncello
,
I
can
compare
to
*NL*
nothing
for
its
strong
calm
melancholy
but
the
rush
and
cadence
of
the
*NL*
wind
among
the
autumn
boughs
.
This
may
seem
a
strange
mode
of
speaking
*NL*
about
the
reading
of
a
parish
clerk
--
a
man
in
rusty
spectacles
,
with
*NL*
stubbly
hair
,
a
large
occiput
,
and
a
prominent
crown
.
But
that
is
*NL*
Nature
's
way
:
she
will
allow
a
gentleman
of
splendid
physiognomy
and
*NL*
poetic
aspirations
to
sing
woefully
out
of
tune
,
and
not
give
him
the
*NL*
slightest
hint
of
it
;
and
takes
care
that
some
narrow-browed
fellow
,
*NL*
trolling
a
ballad
in
the
corner
of
a
pot-house
,
shall
be
as
true
to
his
*NL*
intervals
as
a
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joshua
himself
was
less
proud
of
his
reading
than
of
his
singing
,
and
it
*NL*
was
always
with
a
sense
of
heightened
importance
that
he
passed
from
the
*NL*
desk
to
the
choir
.
Still
more
to-day
:
it
was
a
special
occasion
,
for
an
*NL*
old
man
,
familiar
to
all
the
parish
,
had
died
a
sad
death
--
not
in
his
*NL*
bed
,
a
circumstance
the
most
painful
to
the
mind
of
the
peasant
--
and
*NL*
now
the
funeral
psalm
was
to
be
sung
in
memory
of
his
sudden
departure
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
Bartle
Massey
was
not
at
church
,
and
Joshua
's
importance
in
*NL*
the
choir
suffered
no
eclipse
.
It
was
a
solemn
minor
strain
they
sang
.
*NL*
The
old
psalm-tunes
have
many
a
wail
among
them
,
and
the
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
sweep
`
st
us
off
as
with
a
flood
;
*NL*
We
vanish
hence
like
dreams
--
*NL*
*NL*
seemed
to
have
a
closer
application
than
usual
in
the
death
of
poor
*NL*
Thias
.
The
mother
and
sons
listened
,
each
with
peculiar
feelings
.
*NL*
Lisbeth
had
a
vague
belief
that
the
psalm
was
doing
her
husband
good
;
it
*NL*
was
part
of
that
decent
burial
which
she
would
have
thought
it
a
greater
*NL*
wrong
to
withhold
from
him
than
to
have
caused
him
many
unhappy
days
*NL*
while
he
was
living
.
The
more
there
was
said
about
her
husband
,
the
*NL*
more
there
was
done
for
him
,
surely
the
safer
he
would
be
.
It
was
poor
*NL*
Lisbeth
's
blind
way
of
feeling
that
human
love
and
pity
are
a
ground
of
*NL*
faith
in
some
other
love
.
Seth
,
who
was
easily
touched
,
shed
tears
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
recall
,
as
he
had
done
continually
since
his
father
's
death
,
*NL*
all
that
he
had
heard
of
the
possibility
that
a
single
moment
of
*NL*
consciousness
at
the
last
might
be
a
moment
of
pardon
and
reconcilement
;
*NL*
for
was
it
not
written
in
the
very
psalm
they
were
singing
that
the
*NL*
Divine
dealings
were
not
measured
and
circumscribed
by
time
?
Adam
had
*NL*
never
been
unable
to
join
in
a
psalm
before
.
He
had
known
plenty
of
*NL*
trouble
and
vexation
since
he
had
been
a
lad
,
but
this
was
the
first
*NL*
sorrow
that
had
hemmed
in
his
voice
,
and
strangely
enough
it
was
sorrow
*NL*
because
the
chief
source
of
his
past
trouble
and
vexation
was
for
ever
*NL*
gone
out
of
his
reach
.
He
had
not
been
able
to
press
his
father
's
*NL*
hand
before
their
parting
,
and
say
,
``
Father
,
you
know
it
was
all
right
*NL*
between
us
;
I
never
forgot
what
I
owed
you
when
I
was
a
lad
;
you
forgive
*NL*
me
if
I
have
been
too
hot
and
hasty
now
and
then
!
''
Adam
thought
but
*NL*
little
to-day
of
the
hard
work
and
the
earnings
he
had
spent
on
his
*NL*
father
:
his
thoughts
ran
constantly
on
what
the
old
man
's
feelings
had
*NL*
been
in
moments
of
humiliation
,
when
he
had
held
down
his
head
before
*NL*
the
rebukes
of
his
son
.
When
our
indignation
is
borne
in
submissive
*NL*
silence
,
we
are
apt
to
feel
twinges
of
doubt
afterwards
as
to
our
own
*NL*
generosity
,
if
not
justice
;
how
much
more
when
the
object
of
our
anger
*NL*
has
gone
into
everlasting
silence
,
and
we
have
seen
his
face
for
the
*NL*
last
time
in
the
meekness
of
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
was
always
too
hard
,
''
Adam
said
to
himself
.
``
It
's
a
sore
fault
in
*NL*
me
as
I
'm
so
hot
and
out
o
'
patience
with
people
when
they
do
wrong
,
and
*NL*
my
heart
gets
shut
up
against
'em
,
so
as
I
ca
n't
bring
myself
to
forgive
*NL*
'em
.
I
see
clear
enough
there
's
more
pride
nor
love
in
my
soul
,
for
I
*NL*
could
sooner
make
a
thousand
strokes
with
th
'
hammer
for
my
father
than
*NL*
bring
myself
to
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
And
there
went
plenty
o
'
pride
*NL*
and
temper
to
the
strokes
,
as
the
devil
WILL
be
having
his
finger
in
*NL*
what
we
call
our
duties
as
well
as
our
sins
.
Mayhap
the
best
thing
I
*NL*
ever
did
in
my
life
was
only
doing
what
was
easiest
for
myself
.
It
's
*NL*
allays
been
easier
for
me
to
work
nor
to
sit
still
,
but
the
real
tough
*NL*
job
for
me
`
ud
be
to
master
my
own
will
and
temper
and
go
right
against
*NL*
my
own
pride
.
It
seems
to
me
now
,
if
I
was
to
find
Father
at
home
*NL*
to-night
,
I
should
behave
different
;
but
there
's
no
knowing
--
perhaps
*NL*
nothing
`
ud
be
a
lesson
to
us
if
it
did
n't
come
too
late
.
It
's
well
we
*NL*
should
feel
as
life
's
a
reckoning
we
ca
n't
make
twice
over
;
there
's
*NL*
no
real
making
amends
in
this
world
,
any
more
nor
you
can
mend
a
wrong
*NL*
subtraction
by
doing
your
addition
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
key-note
to
which
Adam
's
thoughts
had
perpetually
returned
*NL*
since
his
father
's
death
,
and
the
solemn
wail
of
the
funeral
psalm
*NL*
was
only
an
influence
that
brought
back
the
old
thoughts
with
stronger
*NL*
emphasis
.
So
was
the
sermon
,
which
Mr.
Irwine
had
chosen
with
reference
*NL*
to
Thias
's
funeral
.
It
spoke
briefly
and
simply
of
the
words
,
``
In
the
*NL*
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
''
--
how
the
present
moment
is
all
we
can
*NL*
call
our
own
for
works
of
mercy
,
of
righteous
dealing
,
and
of
family
*NL*
tenderness
.
All
very
old
truths
--
but
what
we
thought
the
oldest
truth
*NL*
becomes
the
most
startling
to
us
in
the
week
when
we
have
looked
on
the
*NL*
dead
face
of
one
who
has
made
a
part
of
our
own
lives
.
For
when
men
want
*NL*
to
impress
us
with
the
effect
of
a
new
and
wonderfully
vivid
light
,
do
*NL*
they
not
let
it
fall
on
the
most
familiar
objects
,
that
we
may
measure
*NL*
its
intensity
by
remembering
the
former
dimness
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
moment
of
the
final
blessing
,
when
the
forever
sublime
*NL*
words
,
``
The
peace
of
God
,
which
passeth
all
understanding
,
''
seemed
to
*NL*
blend
with
the
calm
afternoon
sunshine
that
fell
on
the
bowed
heads
of
*NL*
the
congregation
;
and
then
the
quiet
rising
,
the
mothers
tying
on
the
*NL*
bonnets
of
the
little
maidens
who
had
slept
through
the
sermon
,
the
*NL*
fathers
collecting
the
prayer-books
,
until
all
streamed
out
through
the
*NL*
old
archway
into
the
green
churchyard
and
began
their
neighbourly
talk
,
*NL*
their
simple
civilities
,
and
their
invitations
to
tea
;
for
on
a
Sunday
*NL*
every
one
was
ready
to
receive
a
guest
--
it
was
the
day
when
all
must
be
*NL*
in
their
best
clothes
and
their
best
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
paused
a
minute
at
the
church
gate
:
they
were
*NL*
waiting
for
Adam
to
come
up
,
not
being
contented
to
go
away
without
*NL*
saying
a
kind
word
to
the
widow
and
her
sons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Bede
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
they
walked
on
together
,
``
you
*NL*
must
keep
up
your
heart
;
husbands
and
wives
must
be
content
when
they
've
*NL*
lived
to
rear
their
children
and
see
one
another
's
hair
grey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
``
they
wonna
have
long
to
wait
for
one
*NL*
another
then
,
anyhow
.
And
ye
've
got
two
o
'
the
strapping
`
st
sons
i
'
*NL*
th
'
country
;
and
well
you
may
,
for
I
remember
poor
Thias
as
fine

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Lisbeth
,
``
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
never
took
notice
of
his
mother
's
little
unjust
plaints
;
but
Seth
*NL*
said
,
``
Nay
,
Mother
,
thee
mustna
say
so
.
Thy
sons

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
Mr.
Poyser
;
``
and
it
's
wrong
on

*NL*
to
give

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Adam
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
feeling
that
his
wife
's
words
were
,
*NL*
as
usual
,
rather
incisive
than
soothing
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
*NL*
change
the
subject
,
``
you
'll
come
and
see
us
again
now
,
I
hope
.
I
hanna
*NL*
had
a
talk
with
you
this
long
while
,
and
the
missis
here
wants
you
to
*NL*
see
what
can
be
done
with
her
best
spinning-wheel
,
for
it
's
got
broke
,
*NL*
and
it
'll
be
a
nice
job
to
mend
it
--
there
'll
want
a
bit
o
'
turning
.
*NL*
You
'll
come
as
soon
as
you
can
now
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
paused
and
looked
round
while
he
was
speaking
,
as
if
to
see
*NL*
where
Hetty
was
;
for
the
children
were
running
on
before
.
Hetty
was
not
*NL*
without
a
companion
,
and
she
had
,
besides
,
more
pink
and
white
about
*NL*
her
than
ever
,
for
she
held
in
her
hand
the
wonderful
pink-and-white
*NL*
hot-house
plant
,
with
a
very
long
name
--
a
Scotch
name
,
she
supposed
,
*NL*
since
people
said
Mr.
Craig
the
gardener
was
Scotch
.
Adam
took
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
looking
round
too
;
and
I
am
sure
you
will
not
require
of
*NL*
him
that
he
should
feel
any
vexation
in
observing
a
pouting
expression
*NL*
on
Hetty
's
face
as
she
listened
to
the
gardener
's
small
talk
.
Yet
in
her
*NL*
secret
heart
she
was
glad
to
have
him
by
her
side
,
for
she
would
perhaps
*NL*
learn
from
him
how
it
was
Arthur
had
not
come
to
church
.
Not
that
she
*NL*
cared
to
ask
him
the
question
,
but
she
hoped
the
information
would
be
*NL*
given
spontaneously
;
for
Mr.
Craig
,
like
a
superior
man
,
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
giving
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craig
was
never
aware
that
his
conversation
and
advances
were
*NL*
received
coldly
,
for
to
shift
one
's
point
of
view
beyond
certain
limits
*NL*
is
impossible
to
the
most
liberal
and
expansive
mind
;
we
are
none
of
*NL*
us
aware
of
the
impression
we
produce
on
Brazilian
monkeys
of
feeble
*NL*
understanding
--
it
is
possible
they
see
hardly
anything
in
us
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
Mr.
Craig
was
a
man
of
sober
passions
,
and
was
already
in
his
tenth
*NL*
year
of
hesitation
as
to
the
relative
advantages
of
matrimony
and
*NL*
bachelorhood
.
It
is
true
that
,
now
and
then
,
when
he
had
been
a
little
*NL*
heated
by
an
extra
glass
of
grog
,
he
had
been
heard
to
say
of
Hetty
*NL*
that
the
``
lass
was
well
enough
,
''
and
that
``
a
man
might
do
worse
''
;
but
on
*NL*
convivial
occasions
men
are
apt
to
express
themselves
strongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
Poyser
held
Mr.
Craig
in
honour
,
as
a
man
who
``
knew
his
business
''
*NL*
and
who
had
great
lights
concerning
soils
and
compost
;
but
he
was
*NL*
less
of
a
favourite
with
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
more
than
once
said
in
*NL*
confidence
to
her
husband
,
``
You
're
mighty
fond
o
'
Craig
,
but
for
my
*NL*
part
,
I
think
he
's
welly
like
a
cock
as
thinks
the
sun
's
rose
o
'
purpose
*NL*
to
hear
him
crow
.
''
For
the
rest
,
Mr.
Craig
was
an
estimable
gardener
,
*NL*
and
was
not
without
reasons
for
having
a
high
opinion
of
himself
.
He
*NL*
had
also
high
shoulders
and
high
cheek-bones
and
hung
his
head
forward
*NL*
a
little
,
as
he
walked
along
with
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
.
I
*NL*
think
it
was
his
pedigree
only
that
had
the
advantage
of
being
Scotch
,
*NL*
and
not
his
``
bringing
up
''
;
for
except
that
he
had
a
stronger
burr
in
*NL*
his
accent
,
his
speech
differed
little
from
that
of
the
Loamshire
people
*NL*
about
him
.
But
a
gardener
is
Scotch
,
as
a
French
teacher
is
Parisian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Poyser
,
''
he
said
,
before
the
good
slow
farmer
had
time
to
*NL*
speak
,
``
ye
'll
not
be
carrying
your
hay
to-morrow
,
I
'm
thinking
.
The

and
ye
may
rely
upo

my
word
as
we
'll

hours

Ye

what
I

`

where

*NL*
and

seems
to
meet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
I
see
the
cloud
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
''
`
rizon
or
no
`
rizon
.
It
's
*NL*
right
o'er
Mike
Holdsworth
's
fallow
,
and
a
foul
fallow
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
mark
my
words
,
as
that
cloud

spread
o'er

pretty
*NL*
nigh
as
quick
as
you
'd
spread
a
tarpaulin
over

your
hay-ricks
.
*NL*
It
's
a
great
thing
to
ha

studied
the
look
o

the
clouds
.
Lord
bless
*NL*
you
!
Th

up

they
'd
just

Mrs.
Poyser

thinking

How
do
ye
*NL*
do
,
Mistress
Bede
?
''
Mr.
Craig
continued
,
without
a
pause
,
nodding
by
the
*NL*
way
to
Adam
and
Seth
.
``
I
hope

enjoyed

If

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
look
pretty
fur

''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
turning
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
and
speaking
in
rather
a
subdued
reverential
tone
.
``
Why
,
what
could

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

said
Adam
.
``
I
was
*NL*
talking

he
said
nothing
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

gone

*NL*
But
he
's
fond
o

getting
away
for
a

,
now
and
then

old
*NL*
squire
fit

like
frost

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Craig
smiled
and
winked
slowly
as
he
made
this
last
observation
,
*NL*
but
the
subject
was
not
developed
farther
,
for
now
they
had
reached
the
*NL*
turning
in
the
road
where
Adam
and
his
companions
must
say
``
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
The
gardener
,
too
,
would
have
had
to
turn
off
in
the
same
direction
if
*NL*
he
had
not
accepted
Mr.
Poyser
's
invitation
to
tea
.
Mrs.
Poyser
duly
*NL*
seconded
the
invitation
,
for
she
would
have
held
it
a
deep
disgrace
not
*NL*
to
make
her
neighbours
welcome
to
her
house
:
personal
likes
and
dislikes
*NL*
must
not
interfere
with
that
sacred
custom
.
Moreover
,
Mr.
Craig
had
*NL*
always
been
full
of
civilities
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
was
scrupulous
in
declaring
that
she
had
``
nothing
to
say
again
'
*NL*
him
,
on
'
y
it
was
a
pity
he
couldna
be
hatched
o'er
again
,
an
'
hatched
*NL*
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Adam
and
Seth
,
with
their
mother
between
them
,
wound
their
way
down
*NL*
to
the
valley
and
up
again
to
the
old
house
,
where
a
saddened
memory
had
*NL*
taken
the
place
of
a
long
,
long
anxiety
--
where
Adam
would
never
have
to
*NL*
ask
again
as
he
entered
,
``
Where
's
Father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
other
family
party
,
with
Mr.
Craig
for
company
,
went
back
to
*NL*
the
pleasant
bright
house-place
at
the
Hall
Farm
--
all
with
quiet
minds
,
*NL*
except
Hetty
,
who
knew
now
where
Arthur
was
gone
,
but
was
only
the
*NL*
more
puzzled
and
uneasy
.
For
it
appeared
that
his
absence
was
quite
*NL*
voluntary
;
he
need
not
have
gone
--
he
would
not
have
gone
if
he
had
*NL*
wanted
to
see
her
.
She
had
a
sickening
sense
that
no
lot
could
ever
*NL*
be
pleasant
to
her
again
if
her
Thursday
night
's
vision
was
not
to
be
*NL*
fulfilled
;
and
in
this
moment
of
chill
,
bare
,
wintry
disappointment
and
*NL*
doubt
,
she
looked
towards
the
possibility
of
being
with
Arthur
again
,
*NL*
of
meeting
his
loving
glance
,
and
hearing
his
soft
words
with
that
eager
*NL*
yearning
which
one
may
call
the
``
growing
pain
''
of
passion
.

Adam
on
a
Working
Day
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NOTWITHSTANDING
Mr.
Craig
's
prophecy
,
the
dark-blue
cloud
dispersed
*NL*
itself
without
having
produced
the
threatened
consequences
.
``
The
*NL*
weather
''
--
as
he
observed
the
next
morning
--
``
the
weather
,
you
see
,
's

a
ticklish
thing
,
an
'
a
fool
`
ull
hit
o
n't
sometimes
when
a
wise
man
*NL*
misses
;
that
's
why
the
almanecks
get
so
much
credit
.
It
's
one
o
'
them
*NL*
chancy
things
as
fools
thrive
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
unreasonable
behaviour
of
the
weather
,
however
,
could
displease
no
*NL*
one
else
in
Hayslope
besides
Mr.
Craig
.
All
hands
were
to
be
out
in
*NL*
the
meadows
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
dew
had
risen
;
the
wives
and
*NL*
daughters
did
double
work
in
every
farmhouse
,
that
the
maids
might
give
*NL*
their
help
in
tossing
the
hay
;
and
when
Adam
was
marching
along
the
*NL*
lanes
,
with
his
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
he
caught
the
sound
*NL*
of
jocose
talk
and
ringing
laughter
from
behind
the
hedges
.
The
jocose
*NL*
talk
of
hay-makers
is
best
at
a
distance
;
like
those
clumsy
bells
round
*NL*
the
cows
'
necks
,
it
has
rather
a
coarse
sound
when
it
comes
close
,
*NL*
and
may
even
grate
on
your
ears
painfully
;
but
heard
from
far
off
,
it
*NL*
mingles
very
prettily
with
the
other
joyous
sounds
of
nature
.
Men
's
*NL*
muscles
move
better
when
their
souls
are
making
merry
music
,
though
*NL*
their
merriment
is
of
a
poor
blundering
sort
,
not
at
all
like
the
*NL*
merriment
of
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
perhaps
there
is
no
time
in
a
summer
's
day
more
cheering
than
when
*NL*
the
warmth
of
the
sun
is
just
beginning
to
triumph
over
the
freshness
*NL*
of
the
morning
--
when
there
is
just
a
lingering
hint
of
early
coolness
*NL*
to
keep
off
languor
under
the
delicious
influence
of
warmth
.
The
reason
*NL*
Adam
was
walking
along
the
lanes
at
this
time
was
because
his
work
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
day
lay
at
a
country-house
about
three
miles
off
,
which
*NL*
was
being
put
in
repair
for
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
squire
;
and
he
*NL*
had
been
busy
since
early
morning
with
the
packing
of
panels
,
doors
,
*NL*
and
chimney-pieces
,
in
a
waggon
which
was
now
gone
on
before
him
,
while
*NL*
Jonathan
Burge
himself
had
ridden
to
the
spot
on
horseback
,
to
await
its
*NL*
arrival
and
direct
the
workmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
walk
was
a
rest
to
Adam
,
and
he
was
unconsciously
under
*NL*
the
charm
of
the
moment
.
It
was
summer
morning
in
his
heart
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
Hetty
in
the
sunshine
--
a
sunshine
without
glare
,
with
slanting
rays
*NL*
that
tremble
between
the
delicate
shadows
of
the
leaves
.
He
thought
,
*NL*
yesterday
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
as
they
came
out
of
church
,
*NL*
that
there
was
a
touch
of
melancholy
kindness
in
her
face
,
such
as
he
*NL*
had
not
seen
before
,
and
he
took
it
as
a
sign
that
she
had
some
sympathy
*NL*
with
his
family
trouble
.
Poor
fellow
!
That
touch
of
melancholy
came
from
*NL*
quite
another
source
,
but
how
was
he
to
know
?
We
look
at
the
one
little
*NL*
woman
's
face
we
love
as
we
look
at
the
face
of
our
mother
earth
,
and
see
*NL*
all
sorts
of
answers
to
our
own
yearnings
.
It
was
impossible
for
Adam
*NL*
not
to
feel
that
what
had
happened
in
the
last
week
had
brought
the
*NL*
prospect
of
marriage
nearer
to
him
.
Hitherto
he
had
felt
keenly
the
*NL*
danger
that
some
other
man
might
step
in
and
get
possession
of
Hetty
's
*NL*
heart
and
hand
,
while
he
himself
was
still
in
a
position
that
made
him
*NL*
shrink
from
asking
her
to
accept
him
.
Even
if
he
had
had
a
strong
hope
*NL*
that
she
was
fond
of
him
--
and
his
hope
was
far
from
being
strong
--
he
*NL*
had
been
too
heavily
burdened
with
other
claims
to
provide
a
home
for
*NL*
himself
and
Hetty
--
a
home
such
as
he
could
expect
her
to
be
content
with
*NL*
after
the
comfort
and
plenty
of
the
Farm
.
Like
all
strong
natures
,
Adam
*NL*
had
confidence
in
his
ability
to
achieve
something
in
the
future
;
he
*NL*
felt
sure
he
should
some
day
,
if
he
lived
,
be
able
to
maintain
a
family
*NL*
and
make
a
good
broad
path
for
himself
;
but
he
had
too
cool
a
head
not
*NL*
to
estimate
to
the
full
the
obstacles
that
were
to
be
overcome
.
And
the
*NL*
time
would
be
so
long
!
And
there
was
Hetty
,
like
a
bright-cheeked
apple
*NL*
hanging
over
the
orchard
wall
,
within
sight
of
everybody
,
and
everybody
*NL*
must
long
for
her
!
To
be
sure
,
if
she
loved
him
very
much
,
she
would
be
*NL*
content
to
wait
for
him
:
but
DID
she
love
him
?
His
hopes
had
never
risen
*NL*
so
high
that
he
had
dared
to
ask
her
.
He
was
clear-sighted
enough
to
be
*NL*
aware
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
looked
kindly
on
his
suit
,
and
*NL*
indeed
,
without
this
encouragement
he
would
never
have
persevered
in
*NL*
going
to
the
Farm
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
come
to
any
but
fluctuating
*NL*
conclusions
about
Hetty
's
feelings
.
She
was
like
a
kitten
,
and
had
the
*NL*
same
distractingly
pretty
looks
,
that
meant
nothing
,
for
everybody
that
*NL*
came
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
that
the
heaviest
part
of
*NL*
his
burden
was
removed
,
and
that
even
before
the
end
of
another
year
*NL*
his
circumstances
might
be
brought
into
a
shape
that
would
allow
him
to
*NL*
think
of
marrying
.
It
would
always
be
a
hard
struggle
with
his
mother
,
*NL*
he
knew
:
she
would
be
jealous
of
any
wife
he
might
choose
,
and
she
had
*NL*
set
her
mind
especially
against
Hetty
--
perhaps
for
no
other
reason
than
*NL*
that
she
suspected
Hetty
to
be
the
woman
he
HAD
chosen
.
It
would
never
*NL*
do
,
he
feared
,
for
his
mother
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
when
*NL*
he
was
married
;
and
yet
how
hard
she
would
think
it
if
he
asked
her
to
*NL*
leave
him
!
Yes
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
be
gone
through
with
*NL*
his
mother
,
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
he
must
make
her
feel
that
his
*NL*
will
was
strong
--
it
would
be
better
for
her
in
the
end
.
For
himself
,
*NL*
he
would
have
liked
that
they
should
all
live
together
till
Seth
was
*NL*
married
,
and
they
might
have
built
a
bit
themselves
to
the
old
house
,
*NL*
and
made
more
room
.
He
did
not
like
``
to
part
wi
'
th
'
lad
''
:
they
had
*NL*
hardly
every
been
separated
for
more
than
a
day
since
they
were
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Adam
had
no
sooner
caught
his
imagination
leaping
forward
in
this
*NL*
way
--
making
arrangements
for
an
uncertain
future
--
than
he
checked
*NL*
himself
.
``
A
pretty
building
I
'm
making
,
without
either
bricks
or
*NL*
timber
.
I
'm
up
i
'
the
garret
a
`
ready
,
and
have
n't
so
much
as
dug
the
*NL*
foundation
.
''
Whenever
Adam
was
strongly
convinced
of
any
proposition
,
it
*NL*
took
the
form
of
a
principle
in
his
mind
:
it
was
knowledge
to
be
acted
*NL*
on
,
as
much
as
the
knowledge
that
damp
will
cause
rust
.
Perhaps
here
lay
*NL*
the
secret
of
the
hardness
he
had
accused
himself
of
:
he
had
too
*NL*
little
fellow-feeling
with
the
weakness
that
errs
in
spite
of
foreseen
*NL*
consequences
.
Without
this
fellow-feeling
,
how
are
we
to
get
enough
*NL*
patience
and
charity
towards
our
stumbling
,
falling
companions
in
the
*NL*
long
and
changeful
journey
?
And
there
is
but
one
way
in
which
a
strong
*NL*
determined
soul
can
learn
it
--
by
getting
his
heart-strings
bound
*NL*
round
the
weak
and
erring
,
so
that
he
must
share
not
only
the
outward
*NL*
consequence
of
their
error
,
but
their
inward
suffering
.
That
is
a
long
*NL*
and
hard
lesson
,
and
Adam
had
at
present
only
learned
the
alphabet
of
it
*NL*
in
his
father
's
sudden
death
,
which
,
by
annihilating
in
an
instant
all
*NL*
that
had
stimulated
his
indignation
,
had
sent
a
sudden
rush
of
thought
*NL*
and
memory
over
what
had
claimed
his
pity
and
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
Adam
's
strength
,
not
its
correlative
hardness
,
that
*NL*
influenced
his
meditations
this
morning
.
He
had
long
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
that
it
would
be
wrong
as
well
as
foolish
for
him
to
marry
a
blooming
*NL*
young
girl
,
so
long
as
he
had
no
other
prospect
than
that
of
growing
*NL*
poverty
with
a
growing
family
.
And
his
savings
had
been
so
constantly
*NL*
drawn
upon
-LRB-
besides
the
terrible
sweep
of
paying
for
Seth
's
substitute
*NL*
in
the
militia
-RRB-
that
he
had
not
enough
money
beforehand
to
furnish
even
*NL*
a
small
cottage
,
and
keep
something
in
reserve
against
a
rainy
day
.
He
*NL*
had
good
hope
that
he
should
be
``
firmer
on
his
legs
''
by
and
by
;
but
he
*NL*
could
not
be
satisfied
with
a
vague
confidence
in
his
arm
and
brain
;
he
*NL*
must
have
definite
plans
,
and
set
about
them
at
once
.
The
partnership
*NL*
with
Jonathan
Burge
was
not
to
be
thought
of
at
present
--
there
were
*NL*
things
implicitly
tacked
to
it
that
he
could
not
accept
;
but
Adam
*NL*
thought
that
he
and
Seth
might
carry
on
a
little
business
for
themselves
*NL*
in
addition
to
their
journeyman
's
work
,
by
buying
a
small
stock
of
*NL*
superior
wood
and
making
articles
of
household
furniture
,
for
which
Adam
*NL*
had
no
end
of
contrivances
.
Seth
might
gain
more
by
working
at
separate
*NL*
jobs
under
Adam
's
direction
than
by
his
journeyman
's
work
,
and
Adam
,
*NL*
in
his
overhours
,
could
do
all
the
``
nice
''
work
that
required
peculiar
*NL*
skill
.
The
money
gained
in
this
way
,
with
the
good
wages
he
received
*NL*
as
foreman
,
would
soon
enable
them
to
get
beforehand
with
the
world
,
*NL*
so
sparingly
as
they
would
all
live
now
.
No
sooner
had
this
little
*NL*
plan
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
than
he
began
to
be
busy
with
exact
*NL*
calculations
about
the
wood
to
be
bought
and
the
particular
article
of
*NL*
furniture
that
should
be
undertaken
first
--
a
kitchen
cupboard
of
his
*NL*
own
contrivance
,
with
such
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
sliding-doors
and
*NL*
bolts
,
such
convenient
nooks
for
stowing
household
provender
,
and
such
*NL*
a
symmetrical
result
to
the
eye
,
that
every
good
housewife
would
be
*NL*
in
raptures
with
it
,
and
fall
through
all
the
gradations
of
melancholy
*NL*
longing
till
her
husband
promised
to
buy
it
for
her
.
Adam
pictured
to
*NL*
himself
Mrs.
Poyser
examining
it
with
her
keen
eye
and
trying
in
vain
to
*NL*
find
out
a
deficiency
;
and
,
of
course
,
close
to
Mrs.
Poyser
stood
Hetty
,
*NL*
and
Adam
was
again
beguiled
from
calculations
and
contrivances
into
*NL*
dreams
and
hopes
.
Yes
,
he
would
go
and
see
her
this
evening
--
it
was
so
*NL*
long
since
he
had
been
at
the
Hall
Farm
.
He
would
have
liked
to
go
*NL*
to
the
night-school
,
to
see
why
Bartle
Massey
had
not
been
at
church
*NL*
yesterday
,
for
he
feared
his
old
friend
was
ill
;
but
,
unless
he
could
*NL*
manage
both
visits
,
this
last
must
be
put
off
till
to-morrow
--
the
desire
*NL*
to
be
near
Hetty
and
to
speak
to
her
again
was
too
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
made
up
his
mind
to
this
,
he
was
coming
very
near
to
the
end
of
*NL*
his
walk
,
within
the
sound
of
the
hammers
at
work
on
the
refitting
of
*NL*
the
old
house
.
The
sound
of
tools
to
a
clever
workman
who
loves
his
work
*NL*
is
like
the
tentative
sounds
of
the
orchestra
to
the
violinist
who
*NL*
has
to
bear
his
part
in
the
overture
:
the
strong
fibres
begin
their
*NL*
accustomed
thrill
,
and
what
was
a
moment
before
joy
,
vexation
,
or
*NL*
ambition
,
begins
its
change
into
energy
.
All
passion
becomes
strength
*NL*
when
it
has
an
outlet
from
the
narrow
limits
of
our
personal
lot
in
the
*NL*
labour
of
our
right
arm
,
the
cunning
of
our
right
hand
,
or
the
still
,
*NL*
creative
activity
of
our
thought
.
Look
at
Adam
through
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
day
,
as
he
stands
on
the
scaffolding
with
the
two-feet
ruler
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
whistling
low
while
he
considers
how
a
difficulty
about
a
*NL*
floor-joist
or
a
window-frame
is
to
be
overcome
;
or
as
he
pushes
one
of
*NL*
the
younger
workmen
aside
and
takes
his
place
in
upheaving
a
weight
of
*NL*
timber
,
saying
,
``
Let
alone
,
lad
!
Thee
`
st
got
too
much
gristle
i
'
thy
*NL*
bones
yet
''
;
or
as
he
fixes
his
keen
black
eyes
on
the
motions
of
a
*NL*
workman
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
warns
him
that
his
distances
*NL*
are
not
right
.
Look
at
this
broad-shouldered
man
with
the
bare
muscular
*NL*
arms
,
and
the
thick
,
firm
,
black
hair
tossed
about
like
trodden
*NL*
meadow-grass
whenever
he
takes
off
his
paper
cap
,
and
with
the
strong
*NL*
barytone
voice
bursting
every
now
and
then
into
loud
and
solemn
*NL*
psalm-tunes
,
as
if
seeking
an
outlet
for
superfluous
strength
,
yet
*NL*
presently
checking
himself
,
apparently
crossed
by
some
thought
which
*NL*
jars
with
the
singing
.
Perhaps
,
if
you
had
not
been
already
in
*NL*
the
secret
,
you
might
not
have
guessed
what
sad
memories
what
warm
*NL*
affection
,
what
tender
fluttering
hopes
,
had
their
home
in
this
athletic
*NL*
body
with
the
broken
finger-nails
--
in
this
rough
man
,
who
knew
no
better
*NL*
lyrics
than
he
could
find
in
the
Old
and
New
Version
and
an
occasional
*NL*
hymn
;
who
knew
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
profane
history
;
and
for
*NL*
whom
the
motion
and
shape
of
the
earth
,
the
course
of
the
sun
,
and
the
*NL*
changes
of
the
seasons
lay
in
the
region
of
mystery
just
made
visible
by
*NL*
fragmentary
knowledge
.
It
had
cost
Adam
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
*NL*
work
in
overhours
to
know
what
he
knew
over
and
above
the
secrets
of
his
*NL*
handicraft
,
and
that
acquaintance
with
mechanics
and
figures
,
and
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
materials
he
worked
with
,
which
was
made
easy
to
him
by
*NL*
inborn
inherited
faculty
--
to
get
the
mastery
of
his
pen
,
and
write
a
*NL*
plain
hand
,
to
spell
without
any
other
mistakes
than
must
in
fairness
be
*NL*
attributed
to
the
unreasonable
character
of
orthography
rather
than
to
*NL*
any
deficiency
in
the
speller
,
and
,
moreover
,
to
learn
his
musical
notes
*NL*
and
part-singing
.
Besides
all
this
,
he
had
read
his
Bible
,
including
*NL*
the
apocryphal
books
;
Poor
Richard
's
Almanac
,
Taylor
's
Holy
Living
and
*NL*
Dying
,
The
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
with
Bunyan
's
Life
and
Holy
War
,
a
great
*NL*
deal

Dictionary

Valentine
and
Orson
,
and
part
of
a
History
*NL*
of
Babylon
,
which
Bartle
Massey
had
lent
him
.
He
might
have
had
many
*NL*
more
books
from
Bartle
Massey
,
but
he
had
no
time
for
reading
``
the
*NL*
commin
print
,
''
as
Lisbeth
called
it
,
so
busy
as
he
was
with
figures
in
*NL*
all
the
leisure
moments
which
he
did
not
fill
up
with
extra
carpentry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
you
perceive
,
was
by
no
means
a
marvellous
man
,
nor
,
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
a
genius
,
yet
I
will
not
pretend
that
his
was
an
ordinary
*NL*
character
among
workmen
;
and
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
safe
conclusion
*NL*
that
the
next
best
man
you
may
happen
to
see
with
a
basket
of
tools
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
and
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
has
the
strong
conscience
and
*NL*
the
strong
sense
,
the
blended
susceptibility
and
self-command
,
of
our
*NL*
friend
Adam
.
He
was
not
an
average
man
.
Yet
such
men
as
he
are
reared
*NL*
here
and
there
in
every
generation
of
our
peasant
artisans
--
with
an
*NL*
inheritance
of
affections
nurtured
by
a
simple
family
life
of
common
*NL*
need
and
common
industry
,
and
an
inheritance
of
faculties
trained
*NL*
in
skilful
courageous
labour
:
they
make
their
way
upwards
,
rarely
as
*NL*
geniuses
,
most
commonly
as
painstaking
honest
men
,
with
the
skill
and
*NL*
conscience
to
do
well
the
tasks
that
lie
before
them
.
Their
lives
have
*NL*
no
discernible
echo
beyond
the
neighbourhood
where
they
dwelt
,
but
you
*NL*
are
almost
sure
to
find
there
some
good
piece
of
road
,
some
building
,
*NL*
some
application
of
mineral
produce
,
some
improvement
in
farming
*NL*
practice
,
some
reform
of
parish
abuses
,
with
which
their
names
are
*NL*
associated
by
one
or
two
generations
after
them
.
Their
employers
were
*NL*
the
richer
for
them
,
the
work
of
their
hands
has
worn
well
,
and
the
work
*NL*
of
their
brains
has
guided
well
the
hands
of
other
men
.
They
went
about
*NL*
in
their
youth
in
flannel
or
paper
caps
,
in
coats
black
with
coal-dust
*NL*
or
streaked
with
lime
and
red
paint
;
in
old
age
their
white
hairs
are
*NL*
seen
in
a
place
of
honour
at
church
and
at
market
,
and
they
tell
their
*NL*
well-dressed
sons
and
daughters
,
seated
round
the
bright
hearth
on
*NL*
winter
evenings
,
how
pleased
they
were
when
they
first
earned
their
*NL*
twopence
a-day
.
Others
there
are
who
die
poor
and
never
put
off
the
*NL*
workman
's
coal
on
weekdays
.
They
have
not
had
the
art
of
getting
rich
,
*NL*
but
they
are
men
of
trust
,
and
when
they
die
before
the
work
is
all
out
*NL*
of
them
,
it
is
as
if
some
main
screw
had
got
loose
in
a
machine
;
the
*NL*
master
who
employed
them
says
,
``
Where
shall
I
find
their
like
?

Adam
Visits
the

Farm

*NL*
*NL*
ADAM
came
back
from
his
work
in
the
empty
waggon
--
that
was
why
he
had
*NL*
changed
his
clothes
--
and
was
ready
to
set
out
to
the
Hall
Farm
when
it
*NL*
still
wanted
a
quarter
to
seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
thee
got
thy
Sunday
cloose
on
for
?
''
said
Lisbeth
complainingly
,
*NL*
as
he
came
downstairs
.
``
Thee
artna
goin

to
th
'
school
i
'
thy
best
*NL*
coat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
quietly
.
``
I
'm
going
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
but
*NL*
mayhap
I
may
go
to
the
school
after

so
thee
mustna
wonder
if
I
'm
a
*NL*

Seth

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
mother
,
I
ca
n't
stay
,
''
said
Adam
,
putting
on
his
hat
and
*NL*
going
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
no
sooner
gone
a
few
paces
beyond
the
door
than
Lisbeth
*NL*
became
uneasy
at
the
thought
that
she
had
vexed
him
.
Of
course
,
the
*NL*
secret
of
her
objection
to
the
best
clothes
was
her
suspicion
that
they
*NL*
were
put
on
for
Hetty
's
sake
;
but
deeper
than
all
her
peevishness
lay
*NL*
the
need
that
her
son
should
love
her
.
She
hurried
after
him
,
and
laid
*NL*
hold
of
his
arm
before
he
had
got
half-way
down
to
the
brook
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Nay
,
my
lad
,
thee
wutna
go
away
angered
wi
'
thy
mother
,
an
'
her
got
*NL*
nought
to
do
but
to
sit
by
hersen
an
'
think
on
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
Mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
gravely
,
and
standing
still
while
he
put
*NL*
his
arm
on
her
shoulder
,
``
I
'm
not
angered
.
But
I
wish
,
for
thy
own
sake
,
*NL*
thee
`
dst
be
more
contented
to
let
me
do
what
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
do
.
*NL*
I
'll
never
be
no
other
than
a
good
son
to
thee
as
long
as
we
live
.
But
a
*NL*
man
has
other
feelings
besides
what
he
owes
to
's
father
and
mother
,
and
*NL*
thee
oughtna
to
want
to
rule
over
me
body
and
soul
.
And
thee
must
make
*NL*
up
thy
mind
as
I
'll
not
give
way
to
thee
where
I
've
a
right
to
do
what
I
*NL*
like
.
So
let
us
have
no
more
words
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
''
said
Lisbeth
,
not
willing
to
show
that
she
felt
the
real
bearing
*NL*
of
Adam
's
words
,
``
and
'
who
likes
to
see
thee
i
'
thy
best
cloose
better
*NL*
nor
thy

An
'
when

got
thy

washed
as
clean
as

nice

and
thy

*NL*
a-sparklin

--
what
else
is
there
as
thy
old
mother
should
like
to
look
at
*NL*
half
so
well
?
An

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
;
good-bye
,
mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
kissing
her
and
hurrying
*NL*
away
.
He
saw
there
was
no
other
means
of
putting
an
end
to
the
dialogue
.
*NL*
Lisbeth
stood
still
on
the
spot
,
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
after
him
*NL*
till
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
.
She
felt
to
the
full
all
the
meaning
*NL*
that
had
lain
in
Adam
's
words
,
and
,
as
she
lost
sight
of
him
and
turned
*NL*
back
slowly
into
the
house
,
she
said
aloud
to
herself
--
for
it
was
her
*NL*
way
to
speak
her
thoughts
aloud
in
the
long
days
when
her
husband
and
*NL*
sons
were
at
their
work
--
``
Eh
,
he
'll
be

Eh

''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
still
louder
,
as
she
caught
up
her
knitting
from
the
table
,
``
but
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Adam
walked
so
fast
that
he
was
at
the
yard-gate
before
seven
.
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
were
not
yet
come
in
from
the
meadow
:
every
*NL*
one
was
in
the
meadow
,
even
to
the
black-and-tan
terrier
--
no
one
*NL*
kept
watch
in
the
yard
but
the
bull-dog
;
and
when
Adam
reached
the
*NL*
house-door
,
which
stood
wide
open
,
he
saw
there
was
no
one
in
the
bright
*NL*
clean
house-place
.
But
he
guessed
where
Mrs.
Poyser
and
some
one
else
*NL*
would
be
,
quite
within
hearing
;
so
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
said
in
*NL*
his
strong
voice
,
``
Mrs.
Poyser
within
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Mr.
Bede
,
come
in

Mrs.
Poyser
called
out
from
the
dairy
.
She
*NL*
always
gave
Adam
this
title
when
she
received
him
in
her
own
house
.
*NL*
``
You
may
come
into
the
dairy
if
you
will
,
for
I
canna
justly
leave
the
*NL*
cheese

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
walked
into
the
dairy
,
where
Mrs.
Poyser
and
Nancy
were
crushing
*NL*
the
first
evening
cheese
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
might
think
you
war
come
to
a
dead-house

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
*NL*
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
;
``
they

*NL*
Martin

Adam
longed
to
say
he
would
go
into
the
garden
till
Mr.
Poyser
came
in

*NL*
but
he
was
not
quite
courageous
enough
,
so
he
said
,
``
I

said
Mrs.

reaching
a
small
white
basin
that
stood
on
*NL*
the

and
dipping
it
into
the
whey-tub
,
``

*NL*
Mrs.

was
not
to
be
caught
in
the
weakness

smiling
at
a

compliment
,
but
a
quiet
complacency
over-spread
her
face
like
a
stealing
*NL*
sunbeam
,
and
gave
a
milder
glance
than
usual
to
her
blue-grey
eyes
,
*NL*
as
she
looked
at
Adam
drinking
the
whey
.
Ah
!
I
think
I
taste
that
whey
*NL*
now
--
with
a
flavour
so
delicate
that
one
can
hardly
distinguish
it
from
*NL*
an
odour
,
and
with
that
soft
gliding
warmth
that
fills
one
's
imagination
*NL*
with
a
still
,
happy
dreaminess
.
And
the
light
music
of
the
dropping
whey
*NL*
is
in
my
ears
,
mingling
with
the
twittering
of
a
bird
outside
the
wire
*NL*
network
window
--
the
window
overlooking
the
garden
,
and
shaded
by
tall
*NL*
Guelder
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
little
more
,
Mr.
Bede
?
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
Adam
set
down
the
*NL*
basin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
;
I
'll
go
into
the
garden
now
,
and
send
in
the
little
*NL*
lass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
do
;
and
tell
her
to
come
to
her
mother
in
the
dairy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
walked
round
by
the
rick-yard
,
at
present
empty
of
ricks
,
to
*NL*
the
little
wooden
gate
leading
into
the
garden
--
once
the
well-tended
*NL*
kitchen-garden
of
a
manor-house
;
now
,
but
for
the
handsome
brick
wall
*NL*
with
stone
coping
that
ran
along
one
side
of
it
,
a
true
farmhouse
*NL*
garden
,
with
hardy
perennial
flowers
,
unpruned
fruit-trees
,
and
kitchen
*NL*
vegetables
growing
together
in
careless
,
half-neglected
abundance
.
In
*NL*
that
leafy
,
flowery
,
bushy
time
,
to
look
for
any
one
in
this
garden
*NL*
was
like
playing
at
``
hide-and-seek
.
''
There
were
the
tall
hollyhocks
*NL*
beginning
to
flower
and
dazzle
the
eye
with
their
pink
,
white
,
and
*NL*
yellow
;
there
were
the
syringas
and
Guelder
roses
,
all
large
and
*NL*
disorderly
for
want
of
trimming
;
there
were
leafy
walls
of
scarlet
beans
*NL*
and
late
peas
;
there
was
a
row
of
bushy
filberts
in
one
direction
,
*NL*
and
in
another
a
huge
apple-tree
making
a
barren
circle
under
its
*NL*
low-spreading
boughs
.
But
what
signified
a
barren
patch
or
two
?
The
*NL*
garden
was
so
large
.
There
was
always
a
superfluity
of
broad
beans
--
it
*NL*
took
nine
or
ten
of
Adam
's
strides
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
uncut
grass
*NL*
walk
that
ran
by
the
side
of
them
;
and
as
for
other
vegetables
,
there
*NL*
was
so
much
more
room
than
was
necessary
for
them
that
in
the
rotation
*NL*
of
crops
a
large
flourishing
bed
of
groundsel
was
of
yearly
occurrence
*NL*
on
one
spot
or
other
.
The
very
rose-trees
at
which
Adam
stopped
to
pluck
*NL*
one
looked
as
if
they
grew
wild
;
they
were
all
huddled
together
in
bushy
*NL*
masses
,
now
flaunting
with
wide-open
petals
,
almost
all
of
them
of
the
*NL*
streaked
pink-and-white
kind
,
which
doubtless
dated
from
the
union
*NL*
of
the
houses
of
York
and
Lancaster
.
Adam
was
wise
enough
to
choose
a
*NL*
compact
Provence
rose
that
peeped
out
half-smothered
by
its
flaunting
*NL*
scentless
neighbours
,
and
held
it
in
his
hand
--
he
thought
he
should
be
*NL*
more
at
ease
holding
something
in
his
hand
--
as
he
walked
on
to
the
far
*NL*
end
of
the
garden
,
where
he
remembered
there
was
the
largest
row
of
*NL*
currant-trees
,
not
far
off
from
the
great
yew-tree
arbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
not
gone
many
steps
beyond
the
roses
,
when
he
heard
the
*NL*
shaking
of
a
bough
,
and
a
boy
's
voice
saying
,
``
Now
,
then
,
Totty
,
hold
*NL*
out
your
pinny
--
there
's
a
duck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
came
from
the
boughs
of
a
tall
cherry-tree
,
where
Adam
had
*NL*
no
difficulty
in
discerning
a
small
blue-pinafored
figure
perched
in
a
*NL*
commodious
position
where
the
fruit
was
thickest
.
Doubtless
Totty
was
*NL*
below
,
behind
the
screen
of
peas
.
Yes
--
with
her
bonnet
hanging
down
her
*NL*
back
,
and
her
fat
face
,
dreadfully
smeared
with
red
juice
,
turned
up
*NL*
towards
the
cherry-tree
,
while
she
held
her
little
round
hole
of
a
mouth
*NL*
and
her
red-stained
pinafore
to
receive
the
promised
downfall
.
I
am
*NL*
sorry
to
say
,
more
than
half
the
cherries
that
fell
were
hard
and
yellow
*NL*
instead
of
juicy
and
red
;
but
Totty
spent
no
time
in
useless
regrets
,
*NL*
and
she
was
already
sucking
the
third
juiciest
when
Adam
said
,
``
There
*NL*
now
,
Totty
,
you
've
got
your
cherries
.
Run
into
the
house
with
'em
to
*NL*
Mother
--
she
wants
you
--
she
's
in
the
dairy
.
Run
in
this
minute
--
there
's
a
*NL*
good
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
her
up
in
his
strong
arms
and
kissed
her
as
he
spoke
,
*NL*
a
ceremony
which
Totty
regarded
as
a
tiresome
interruption
to
*NL*
cherry-eating
;
and
when
he
set
her
down
she
trotted
off
quite
silently
*NL*
towards
the
house
,
sucking
her
cherries
as
she
went
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tommy
,
my
lad
,
take
care
you
're
not
shot
for
a
little
thieving
bird
,
''
*NL*
said
Adam
,
as
he
walked
on
towards
the
currant-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
there
was
a
large
basket
at
the
end
of
the
row
:
Hetty
would
*NL*
not
be
far
off
,
and
Adam
already
felt
as
if
she
were
looking
at
him
.
Yet
*NL*
when
he
turned
the
corner
she
was
standing
with
her
back
towards
him
,
*NL*
and
stooping
to
gather
the
low-hanging
fruit
.
Strange
that
she
had
*NL*
not
heard
him
coming
!
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
making
the
*NL*
leaves
rustle
.
She
started
when
she
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
*NL*
near
--
started
so
violently
that
she
dropped
the
basin
with
the
currants
*NL*
in
it
,
and
then
,
when
she
saw
it
was
Adam
,
she
turned
from
pale
to
deep
*NL*
red
.
That
blush
made
his
heart
beat
with
a
new
happiness
.
Hetty
had
*NL*
never
blushed
at
seeing
him
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
frightened
you
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
delicious
sense
that
it
did
n't
*NL*
signify
what
he
said
,
since
Hetty
seemed
to
feel
as
much
as
he
did
;
``
let
*NL*
ME
pick
the
currants
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
soon
done
,
for
they
had
only
fallen
in
a
tangled
mass
on
the
*NL*
grass-plot
,
and
Adam
,
as
he
rose
and
gave
her
the
basin
again
,
looked
*NL*
straight
into
her
eyes
with
the
subdued
tenderness
that
belongs
to
the
*NL*
first
moments
of
hopeful
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
did
not
turn
away
her
eyes
;
her
blush
had
subsided
,
and
she
met
*NL*
his
glance
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
which
contented
Adam
because
it
was
so
*NL*
unlike
anything
he
had
seen
in
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
many
more
currants
to
get
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
shall
soon
ha
'
*NL*
done
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
help
you
,
''
said
Adam
;
and
he
fetched
the
large
basket
,
which
was
*NL*
nearly
full
of
currants
,
and
set
it
close
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
more
was
spoken
as
they
gathered
the
currants
.
Adam
's
heart
*NL*
was
too
full
to
speak
,
and
he
thought
Hetty
knew
all
that
was
in
it
.
She
*NL*
was
not
indifferent
to
his
presence
after
all
;
she
had
blushed
when
she
*NL*
saw
him
,
and
then
there
was
that
touch
of
sadness
about
her
which
must
*NL*
surely
mean
love
,
since
it
was
the
opposite
of
her
usual
manner
,
which
*NL*
had
often
impressed
him
as
indifference
.
And
he
could
glance
at
her
*NL*
continually
as
she
bent
over
the
fruit
,
while
the
level
evening
sunbeams
*NL*
stole
through
the
thick
apple-tree
boughs
,
and
rested
on
her
round
cheek
*NL*
and
neck
as
if
they
too
were
in
love
with
her
.
It
was
to
Adam
the
time
*NL*
that
a
man
can
least
forget
in
after-life
,
the
time
when
he
believes
*NL*
that
the
first
woman
he
has
ever
loved
betrays
by
a
slight
something
--
a
*NL*
word
,
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
the
quivering
of
a
lip
or
an
eyelid
--
that
she
is
*NL*
at
least
beginning
to
love
him
in
return
.
The
sign
is
so
slight
,
it
*NL*
is
scarcely
perceptible
to
the
ear
or
eye
--
he
could
describe
it
to
no
*NL*
one
--
it
is
a
mere
feather-touch
,
yet
it
seems
to
have
changed
his
*NL*
whole
being
,
to
have
merged
an
uneasy
yearning
into
a
delicious
*NL*
unconsciousness
of
everything
but
the
present
moment
.
So
much
of
our
*NL*
early
gladness
vanishes
utterly
from
our
memory
:
we
can
never
recall
the
*NL*
joy
with
which
we
laid
our
heads
on
our
mother
's
bosom
or
rode
on
our
*NL*
father
's
back
in
childhood
.
Doubtless
that
joy
is
wrought
up
into
our
*NL*
nature
,
as
the
sunlight
of
long-past
mornings
is
wrought
up
in
the
soft
*NL*
mellowness
of
the
apricot
,
but
it
is
gone
for
ever
from
our
imagination
,
*NL*
and
we
can
only
BELIEVE
in
the
joy
of
childhood
.
But
the
first
glad
*NL*
moment
in
our
first
love
is
a
vision
which
returns
to
us
to
the
last
,
*NL*
and
brings
with
it
a
thrill
of
feeling
intense
and
special
as
the
*NL*
recurrent
sensation
of
a
sweet
odour
breathed
in
a
far-off
hour
*NL*
of
happiness
.
It
is
a
memory
that
gives
a
more
exquisite
touch
to
*NL*
tenderness
,
that
feeds
the
madness
of
jealousy
and
adds
the
last
*NL*
keenness
to
the
agony
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
bending
over
the
red
bunches
,
the
level
rays
piercing
the
screen
*NL*
of
apple-tree
boughs
,
the
length
of
bushy
garden
beyond
,
his
own
emotion
*NL*
as
he
looked
at
her
and
believed
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
talk
--
Adam
remembered
it
all
to
the
last
*NL*
moment
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Hetty
?
You
know
quite
well
that
Adam
was
mistaken
about
her
.
Like
*NL*
many
other
men
,
he
thought
the
signs
of
love
for
another
were
signs
of
*NL*
love
towards
himself
.
When
Adam
was
approaching
unseen
by
her
,
she
was
*NL*
absorbed
as
usual
in
thinking
and
wondering
about
Arthur
's
possible
*NL*
return
.
The
sound
of
any
man
's
footstep
would
have
affected
her
just
in
*NL*
the
same
way
--
she
would
have
FELT
it
might
be
Arthur
before
she
had
time
*NL*
to
see
,
and
the
blood
that
forsook
her
cheek
in
the
agitation
of
that
*NL*
momentary
feeling
would
have
rushed
back
again
at
the
sight
of
any
one
*NL*
else
just
as
much
as
at
the
sight
of
Adam
.
He
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
*NL*
that
a
change
had
come
over
Hetty
:
the
anxieties
and
fears
of
a
first
*NL*
passion
,
with
which
she
was
trembling
,
had
become
stronger
than
vanity
,
*NL*
had
given
her
for
the
first
time
that
sense
of
helpless
dependence
on
*NL*
another
's
feeling
which
awakens
the
clinging
deprecating
womanhood
even
*NL*
in
the
shallowest
girl
that
can
ever
experience
it
,
and
creates
in
her
a
*NL*
sensibility
to
kindness
which
found
her
quite
hard
before
.
For
the
first
*NL*
time
Hetty
felt
that
there
was
something
soothing
to
her
in
Adam
's
timid
*NL*
yet
manly
tenderness
.
She
wanted
to
be
treated
lovingly
--
oh
,
it
was
*NL*
very
hard
to
bear
this
blank
of
absence
,
silence
,
apparent
indifference
,
*NL*
after
those
moments
of
glowing
love
!
She
was
not
afraid
that
Adam
*NL*
would
tease
her
with
love-making
and
flattering
speeches
like
her
other
*NL*
admirers
;
he
had
always
been
so
reserved
to
her
;
she
could
enjoy
without
*NL*
any
fear
the
sense
that
this
strong
brave
man
loved
her
and
was
near
*NL*
her
.
It
never
entered
into
her
mind
that
Adam
was
pitiable
too
--
that
*NL*
Adam
too
must
suffer
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
,
we
know
,
was
not
the
first
woman
that
had
behaved
more
gently
*NL*
to
the
man
who
loved
her
in
vain
because
she
had
herself
begun
to
love
*NL*
another
.
It
was
a
very
old
story
,
but
Adam
knew
nothing
about
it
,
so
he
*NL*
drank
in
the
sweet
delusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
''
said
Hetty
,
after
a
little
while
.
``
Aunt
wants
me
to
leave
*NL*
some
on
the
trees
.
I
'll
take
'em
in
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well
I
came
to
carry
the
basket
,
''
said
Adam
``
for
it
`
ud
ha
'
*NL*
been
too
heavy
for
your
little
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
could
ha
'
carried
it
with
both
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
daresay
,
''
said
Adam
,
smiling
,
``
and
been
as
long
getting
into
the
*NL*
house
as
a
little
ant
carrying
a
caterpillar
.
Have
you
ever
seen
those
*NL*
tiny
fellows
carrying
things
four
times
as
big
as
themselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Hetty
,
indifferently
,
not
caring
to
know
the
difficulties
of
*NL*
ant
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
used
to
watch
'em
often
when
I
was
a
lad
.
But
now
,
you
see
,
I
can
*NL*
carry
the
basket
with
one
arm
,
as
if
it
was
an
empty
nutshell
,
and
give
*NL*
you
th
'
other
arm
to
lean
on
.
Wo
n't
you
?
Such
big
arms
as
mine
were
made
*NL*
for
little
arms
like
yours
to
lean
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
smiled
faintly
and
put
her
arm
within
his
.
Adam
looked
down
at
*NL*
her
,
but
her
eyes
were
turned
dreamily
towards
another
corner
of
the
*NL*
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
been
to
Eagledale
?
''
she
said
,
as
they
walked
slowly
*NL*
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Adam
,
pleased
to
have
her
ask
a
question
about
himself
.
``
Ten
*NL*
years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
lad
,
I
went
with
father
to
see
about
some
work

there
.
It
's
a
wonderful
sight
--
rocks
and
caves
such
as
you
never
saw
in
*NL*
your
life
.
I
never
had
a
right
notion
o
'
rocks
till
I
went
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
did
it
take
to
get
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
took
us
the
best
part
o
'
two
days
'
walking
.
But
it
's
nothing
of
*NL*
a
day
's
journey
for
anybody
as
has
got
a
first-rate
nag
.
The
captain
`
ud
*NL*
get
there
in
nine
or
ten
hours
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
he
's
such
a
rider
.
And
I
*NL*
should
n't
wonder
if
he
's
back
again
to-morrow
;
he
's
too
active
to
rest
*NL*
long
in
that
lonely
place
,
all
by
himself
,
for
there
's
nothing
but
a
*NL*
bit
of
a
inn
i
'
that
part
where
he
's
gone
to
fish
.
I
wish
he
'd
got
th
'
*NL*
estate
in
his
hands
;
that
`
ud
be
the
right
thing
for
him
,
for
it

*NL*
give
him
plenty
to
do
,
and
he
'd
do
'
t
well
too
,
for
all
he
's
so
young
;
*NL*
he
's
got
better
notions
o
'
things
than
many
a
man
twice
his
age
.
He
*NL*
spoke
very
handsome
to
me
th
'
other
day
about
lending
me
money
to
set
up
*NL*
i
'
business
;
and
if
things
came
round
that
way
,
I
'd
rather
be
beholding
*NL*
to
him
nor
to
any
man
i

the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Adam
was
led
on
to
speak
about
Arthur
because
he
thought
Hetty
*NL*
would
be
pleased
to
know
that
the
young
squire
was
so
ready
to
befriend
*NL*
him
;
the
fact
entered
into
his
future
prospects
,
which
he
would
like
to
*NL*
seem
promising
in
her
eyes
.
And
it
was
true
that
Hetty
listened
with
an
*NL*
interest
which
brought
a
new
light
into
her
eyes
and
a
half-smile
upon
*NL*
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pretty
the
roses
are
now
!
''
Adam
continued
,
pausing
to
look
at
them
.
*NL*
``
See
!
I
stole
the
prettiest
,
but
I
didna
mean
to
keep
it
myself
.
I
think
*NL*
these
as
are
all
pink
,
and
have
got
a
finer
sort
o
'
green
leaves
,
are
*NL*
prettier
than
the
striped
uns
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
down
the
basket
and
took
the
rose
from
his
button-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
smells
very
sweet
,
''
he
said
;
``
those
striped
uns
have
no
smell
.
Stick
*NL*
it
in
your
frock
,
and
then
you
can
put
it
in
water
after
.
It
`
ud
be
a
*NL*
pity
to
let
it
fade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
took
the
rose
,
smiling
as
she
did
so
at
the
pleasant
thought
that
*NL*
Arthur
could
so
soon
get
back
if
he
liked
.
There
was
a
flash
of
hope
and
*NL*
happiness
in
her
mind
,
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
gaiety
she
did
what
*NL*
she
had
very
often
done
before
--
stuck
the
rose
in
her
hair
a
little
*NL*
above
the
left
ear
.
The
tender
admiration
in
Adam
's
face
was
slightly
*NL*
shadowed
by
reluctant
disapproval
.
Hetty
's
love
of
finery
was
just
the
*NL*
thing
that
would
most
provoke
his
mother
,
and
he
himself
disliked
it
*NL*
as
much
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
dislike
anything
that
belonged
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
's
like
the
ladies
in
the
pictures
at
the
Chase
;
*NL*
they
've
mostly
got
flowers
or
feathers
or
gold
things
i
'
their
hair
,
*NL*
but
somehow
I
do
n't
like
to
see
'em
;
they
allays
put
me
i
'
mind
o
'
the
*NL*
painted
women
outside
the
shows
at
Treddles
`
on
Fair
.
What
can
a
woman
*NL*
have
to
set
her
off
better
than
her
own
hair
,
when
it
curls
so
,
like
*NL*
yours
?
If
a
woman
's
young
and
pretty
,
I
think
you
can
see
her
good
looks
*NL*
all
the
better
for
her
being
plain
dressed
.
Why
,
Dinah
Morris
looks
very
*NL*
nice
,
for
all
she
wears
such
a
plain
cap
and
gown
.
It
seems
to
me
as
a
*NL*
woman
's
face
doesna
want
flowers
;
it
's
almost
like
a
flower
itself
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
yours
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
Hetty
,
with
a
little
playful
pout
,
taking
the
rose
*NL*
out
of
her
hair
.
``
I
'll
put
one
o
'
Dinah
's
caps
on
when
we
go
in
,
and
*NL*
you
'll
see
if
I
look
better
in
it
.
She
left
one
behind
,
so
I
can
take
*NL*
the
pattern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
I
do
n't
want
you
to
wear
a
Methodist
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
I
*NL*
daresay
it
's
a
very
ugly
cap
,
and
I
used
to
think
when
I
saw
her
here
as
*NL*
it
was
nonsense
for
her
to
dress
different
t
'
other
people
;
but
I
never
*NL*
rightly
noticed
her
till
she
came
to
see
mother
last
week
,
and
then
I
*NL*
thought
the
cap
seemed
to
fit
her
face
somehow
as
th
`
acorn-cup
fits
th
'
*NL*
acorn
,
and
I
should
n't
like
to
see
her
so
well
without
it
.
But
you
've
*NL*
got
another
sort
o
'
face
;
I
'd
have
you
just
as
you
are
now
,
without
*NL*
anything
t
'
interfere
with
your
own
looks
.
It
's
like
when
a
man
's
*NL*
singing
a
good
tune
--
you
do
n't
want
t
'
hear
bells
tinkling
and
*NL*
interfering
wi
'
the
sound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
arm
and
put
it
within
his
again
,
looking
down
on
her
fondly
.
*NL*
He
was
afraid
she
should
think
he
had
lectured
her
,
imagining
,
as
we
*NL*
are
apt
to
do
,
that
she
had
perceived
all
the
thoughts
he
had
only
*NL*
half-expressed
.
And
the
thing
he
dreaded
most
was
lest
any
cloud
should
*NL*
come
over
this
evening
's
happiness
.
For
the
world
he
would
not
have
*NL*
spoken
of
his
love
to
Hetty
yet
,
till
this
commencing
kindness
towards
*NL*
him
should
have
grown
into
unmistakable
love
.
In
his
imagination
he
*NL*
saw
long
years
of
his
future
life
stretching
before
him
,
blest
with
the
*NL*
right
to
call
Hetty
his
own
:
he
could
be
content
with
very
little
at
*NL*
present
.
So
he
took
up
the
basket
of
currants
once
more
,
and
they
went
*NL*
on
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
had
quite
changed
in
the
half-hour
that
Adam
had
been
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
The
yard
was
full
of
life
now
:
Marty
was
letting
the
screaming
*NL*
geese
through
the
gate
,
and
wickedly
provoking
the
gander
by
hissing
at
*NL*
him
;
the
granary-door
was
groaning
on
its
hinges
as
Alick
shut
it
,
after
*NL*
dealing
out
the
corn
;
the
horses
were
being
led
out
to
watering
,
*NL*
amidst
much
barking
of
all
the
three
dogs
and
many
``
whups
''
from
Tim
the
*NL*
ploughman
,
as
if
the
heavy
animals
who
held
down
their
meek
,
intelligent
*NL*
heads
,
and
lifted
their
shaggy
feet
so
deliberately
,
were
likely
to
rush
*NL*
wildly
in
every
direction
but
the
right
.
Everybody
was
come
back
from
*NL*
the
meadow
;
and
when
Hetty
and
Adam
entered
the
house-place
,
Mr.
Poyser
*NL*
was
seated
in
the
three-cornered
chair
,
and
the
grandfather
in
the
*NL*
large
arm-chair
opposite
,
looking
on
with
pleasant
expectation
while
the
*NL*
supper
was
being
laid
on
the
oak
table
.
Mrs.
Poyser
had
laid
the
cloth
*NL*
herself
--
a
cloth
made
of
homespun
linen
,
with
a
shining
checkered
*NL*
pattern
on
it
,
and
of
an
agreeable
whitey-brown
hue
,
such
as
all
*NL*
sensible
housewives
like
to
see
--
none
of
your
bleached
``
shop-rag
''
that
*NL*
would
wear
into
holes
in
no
time
,
but
good
homespun
that
would
last
*NL*
for
two
generations
.
The
cold
veal
,
the
fresh
lettuces
,
and
the
stuffed
*NL*
chine
might
well
look
tempting
to
hungry
men
who
had
dined
at
half-past
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
.
On
the
large
deal
table
against
the
wall
there
were
*NL*
bright
pewter
plates
and
spoons
and
cans
,
ready
for
Alick
and
his
*NL*
companions
;
for
the
master
and
servants
ate
their
supper
not
far
off
*NL*
each
other
;
which
was
all
the
pleasanter
,
because
if
a
remark
about
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
's
work
occurred
to
Mr.
Poyser
,
Alick
was
at
hand
to
*NL*
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Adam
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
ye
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
What
!
ye
've
been
*NL*
helping
Hetty
to
gether
the
curran
's
,
eh
?
Come
,
sit
ye
down
,
sit
ye
*NL*
down
.
Why
,
it
's
pretty
near
a
three-week
since
y
'
had
your
supper
with
*NL*
us
;
and
the
missis
has
got
one
of
her
rare
stuffed
chines
.
I
'm
glad
*NL*
ye
're
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hetty
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
she
looked
into
the
basket
of
currants
*NL*
to
see
if
the
fruit
was
fine
,
``
run
upstairs
and
send
Molly
down
.
She
's
*NL*
putting
Totty
to
bed
,
and
I
want
her
to
draw
th
'
ale
,
for
Nancy
's
busy
*NL*
yet
i
'
the
dairy
.
You
can
see
to
the
child
.
But
whativer
did
you
let
her
*NL*
run
away
from
you
along
wi
'
Tommy
for
,
and
stuff
herself
wi
'
fruit
as
*NL*
she
ca
n't
eat
a
bit
o
'
good
victual
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
in
a
lower
tone
than
usual
,
while
her
husband
was
talking
*NL*
to
Adam
;
for
Mrs.
Poyser
was
strict
in
adherence
to
her
own
rules
of
*NL*
propriety
,
and
she
considered
that
a
young
girl
was
not
to
be
treated
*NL*
sharply
in
the
presence
of
a
respectable
man
who
was
courting
her
.
That
*NL*
would
not
be
fair-play
:
every
woman
was
young
in
her
turn
,
and
had
her
*NL*
chances
of
matrimony
,
which
it
was
a
point
of
honour
for
other
women
not
*NL*
to
spoil
--
just
as
one
market-woman
who
has
sold
her
own
eggs
must
not
*NL*
try
to
balk
another
of
a
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
made
haste
to
run
away
upstairs
,
not
easily
finding
an
answer
to
*NL*
her
aunt
's
question
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
went
out
to
see
after
Marty
and
*NL*
Tommy
and
bring
them
in
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
they
were
all
seated
--
the
two
rosy
lads
,
one
on
each
side
,
by
the
*NL*
pale
mother
,
a
place
being
left
for
Hetty
between
Adam
and
her
uncle
.
*NL*
Alick
too
was
come
in
,
and
was
seated
in
his
far
corner
,
eating
cold
*NL*
broad
beans
out
of
a
large
dish
with
his
pocket-knife
,
and
finding
*NL*
a
flavour
in
them
which
he
would
not
have
exchanged
for
the
finest
*NL*
pineapple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
time
that
gell
is
drawing
th
'
ale
,
to
be
sure
!
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
,
when
she
was
dispensing
her
slices
of
stuffed
chine
.
``
I
think
*NL*
she
sets
the
jug
under
and
forgets
to
turn
the
tap
,
as
there
's
nothing
*NL*
you
ca
n't
believe
o
'
them
wenches
:
they
'll
set
the
empty
kettle
o
'
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
then
come
an
hour
after
to
see
if
the
water
boils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
drawin

for
the
men
too

''
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
Thee

*NL*
told
her
to
bring
our
jug
up
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Told
her
?

said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
``
Yes
,
I
might
spend
all
the
wind
i

my

body

if
I
was
to
tell

everything

Mr.
Bede
,
will
you
take
some
*NL*
vinegar
with
your
lettuce
?
Aye
you
're
i

the
right
not
.
It
spoils
the
*NL*
flavour
o
'
the
chine
,
to
my
thinking
.
It
's
poor
eating
where
the
flavour
*NL*
o
'
the
meat
lies
i
'
the
cruets
.
There
's
folks
as

bad
butter

salt

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
's
attention
was
here
diverted
by
the
appearance
of
Molly
,
*NL*
carrying
a
large
jug
,
two
small
mugs
,
and
four
drinking-cans
,
all
full
*NL*
of
ale
or
small
beer
--
an
interesting
example
of
the
prehensile
power
*NL*
possessed
by
the
human
hand
.
Poor
Molly
's
mouth
was
rather
wider
open
*NL*
than
usual
,
as
she
walked
along
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
double
*NL*
cluster
of
vessels
in
her
hands
,
quite
innocent
of
the
expression
in
her
*NL*
mistress
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Molly
,
I
niver
knew
your
equils

to

o

your
poor
mother
as
is
*NL*
a
widow

an

as
good
as

an

the

*NL*
times

've
told
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
had
not
seen
the
lightning
,
and
the
thunder
shook
her
nerves
the
*NL*
more
for
the
want
of
that
preparation
.
With
a
vague
alarmed
sense
that
*NL*
she
must
somehow
comport
herself
differently
,
she
hastened
her
step
*NL*
a
little
towards
the
far
deal
table
,
where
she
might
set
down
her
*NL*
cans
--
caught
her
foot
in
her
apron
,
which
had
become
untied
,
and
fell
*NL*
with
a
crash
and
a
splash
into
a
pool
of
beer
;
whereupon
a
tittering
*NL*
explosion
from
Marty
and
Tommy
,
and
a
serious
``
Ello
!
''
from
Mr.
Poyser
,
*NL*
who
saw
his
draught
of
ale
unpleasantly
deferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
go
!
''
resumed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
in
a
cutting
tone
,
as
she
rose
and
*NL*
went
towards
the
cupboard
while
Molly
began
dolefully

Poor
Molly

were
dropping
fast
by

in
her
*NL*
desperation
at
the
lively
movement
of
the
beer-stream
towards
Alick

,
she
was
converting
her

Mrs.

opening

*NL*
Mrs.

had
turned
round
from
the
cupboard
with
the
brown-and-white
*NL*
jug
in
her
hand
,
when
she
caught
sight
of
something
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
kitchen
;
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
already
trembling
and
*NL*
nervous
that
the
apparition
had
so
strong
an
effect
on
her
;
perhaps
*NL*
jug-breaking
,
like
other
crimes
,
has
a
contagious
influence
.
However
*NL*
it
was
,
she
stared
and
started
like
a
ghost-seer
,
and
the
precious
*NL*
brown-and-white
jug
fell
to
the
ground
,
parting
for
ever
with
its
spout
*NL*
and
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
anybody

she
said
,
with
a
suddenly
lowered
*NL*
tone
,
after
a
moment
's
bewildered
glance
round
the
room
.
``
The
jugs
are
*NL*
bewitched

I

It

*NL*
``

had
now
joined
in
the
laugh
of
the
young
ones

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

fine

Mrs.

*NL*
A
new
outbreak
of
laughter
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
was
speaking
,
was
caused
,
*NL*
less
by
her
sudden
conversion
to
a
fatalistic
view
of
jug-breaking
than
*NL*
by
that
strange
appearance
of
Hetty
,
which
had
startled
her
aunt
.
The
*NL*
little
minx
had
found
a
black
gown
of
her
aunt
's
,
and
pinned
it
close
*NL*
round
her
neck
to
look
like
Dinah
's
,
had
made
her
hair
as
flat
as
she
*NL*
could
,
and
had
tied
on
one
of
Dinah
's
high-crowned
borderless
net
caps
.
*NL*
The
thought
of
Dinah
's
pale
grave
face
and
mild
grey
eyes
,
which
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
gown
and
cap
brought
with
it
,
made
it
a
laughable
surprise
*NL*
enough
to
see
them
replaced
by
Hetty
's
round
rosy
cheeks
and
coquettish
*NL*
dark
eyes
.
The
boys
got
off
their
chairs
and
jumped
round
her
,
clapping
*NL*
their
hands
,
and
even
Alick
gave
a
low
ventral
laugh
as
he
looked
up
*NL*
from
his
beans
.
Under
cover
of
the
noise
,
Mrs.
Poyser
went
into
the
back
*NL*
kitchen
to
send
Nancy
into
the
cellar
with
the
great
pewter
measure
,
*NL*
which
had
some
chance
of
being
free
from
bewitchment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Hetty
,

are
ye
turned
Methodist

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
*NL*
that
comfortable
slow
enjoyment
of
a
laugh
which
one
only
sees
in
stout
*NL*
people
.
``

*NL*
``

down
demurely

Mrs.
Poyser
,
you
perceive
,
was
aware
that
nothing
would
be
so
likely
*NL*
to
expel
the
comic
as
the
terrible

Tommy
,
who
was
of
a
susceptible
*NL*
disposition
,
and
very
fond
of
his
mother
,
and
who
had
,
besides
,
eaten
so
*NL*
many
cherries
as
to
have
his
feelings
less
under

usual

was

so
affected
by
the
dreadful
picture

had
made

possible
future

he
began
to
cry

the
good-natured
father

indulgent
to
all

weaknesses
but
those
of
negligent
farmers

said
to

``

*NL*
Hetty
went
upstairs
again
,
and
the
arrival
of
the
ale
made
an
agreeable
*NL*
diversion
;
for
Adam
had
to
give
his
opinion
of
the
new
tap
,
which
could
*NL*
not
be
otherwise
than
complimentary
to
Mrs.
Poyser
;
and
then
followed
*NL*
a
discussion
on
the
secrets
of
good
brewing
,
the
folly
of
stinginess
in
*NL*
``
hopping
,
''
and
the
doubtful
economy
of
a
farmer
's
making
his
own
malt
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
had
so
many
opportunities
of
expressing
herself
with
*NL*
weight
on
these
subjects
that
by
the
time
supper
was
ended
,
the
ale-jug
*NL*
refilled
,
and
Mr.
Poyser
's
pipe
alight
she
was
once
more
in
high
good

humour
,
and
ready
,
at
Adam

request
,
to
fetch
the
broken
spinning-wheel
*NL*
for
his
inspection

*NL*
*NL*
``

Adam
,
looking
at
it
carefully
,
``
here

Mr.

entered
with
interest
into
a
project
which
seemed
a
step
*NL*
towards
Adam
's
becoming
a
``
master-man

Mrs.
Poyser
gave
her
*NL*
approbation
to
the
scheme
of
the
movable
kitchen
cupboard

which
was
to

be
capable
of
containing
grocery

pickles
,
crockery

and
house-linen
in

the
utmost

Hetty

once
more
in

with

neckerchief
pushed
a

backwards

was
seated
picking
currants
near

window

where
Adam
could
*NL*
see
her
quite
well

And
so
the
time
passed
pleasantly
till
Adam
got
up
*NL*
to
go

He
was
pressed
to
come
again
soon

not

longer

busy

*NL*
``
Aye

''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
when
Adam
was
out
of
on
the
*NL*
causeway
.
``
Sitting
up

*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
moving
across
the
kitchen
with
the
currants
,
so
her
uncle
did
*NL*
not
see
the
little
toss
of
the
head
with
which
she
answered
him
.
To
ride
*NL*
in
a
spring-cart
seemed
a
very
miserable

indeed
to

Chapter
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Night-School
and
the
Schoolmaster
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
Massey
's
was
one
of
a
few
scattered
houses
on
the
edge
of
a
*NL*
common
,
which
was
divided
by
the
road
to
Treddleston
.
Adam
reached
it
*NL*
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
leaving
the
Hall
Farm
;
and
when
he
had
his
*NL*
hand
on
the
door-latch
,
he
could
see
,
through
the
curtainless
window
,
*NL*
that
there
were
eight
or
nine
heads
bending
over
the
desks
,
lighted
by
*NL*
thin
dips
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
,
a
reading
lesson
was
going
forward
and
Bartle
Massey
*NL*
merely
nodded
,
leaving
him
to
take
his
place
where
he
pleased
.
He
had
*NL*
not
come
for
the
sake
of
a
lesson
to-night
,
and
his
mind
was
too
full
*NL*
of
personal
matters
,
too
full
of
the
last
two
hours
he
had
passed
in
*NL*
Hetty
's
presence
,
for
him
to
amuse
himself
with
a
book
till
school
was
*NL*
over
;
so
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
looked
on
with
an
absent
mind
.
It
*NL*
was
a
sort
of
scene
which
Adam
had
beheld
almost
weekly
for
years
;
he
*NL*
knew
by
heart
every
arabesque
flourish
in
the
framed
specimen
of
Bartle
*NL*
Massey
's
handwriting
which
hung
over
the
schoolmaster
's
head
,
by
way
of
*NL*
keeping
a
lofty
ideal
before
the
minds
of
his
pupils
;
he
knew
the
backs
*NL*
of
all
the
books
on
the
shelf
running
along
the
whitewashed
wall
above
*NL*
the
pegs
for
the
slates
;
he
knew
exactly
how
many
grains
were
gone
out
*NL*
of
the
ear
of
Indian
corn
that
hung
from
one
of
the
rafters
;
he
had
long
*NL*
ago
exhausted
the
resources
of
his
imagination
in
trying
to
think
*NL*
how
the
bunch
of
leathery
seaweed
had
looked
and
grown
in
its
native
*NL*
element
;
and
from
the
place
where
he
sat
,
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
*NL*
old
map
of
England
that
hung
against
the
opposite
wall
,
for
age
had
*NL*
turned
it
of
a
fine
yellow
brown
,
something
like
that
of
a
well-seasoned
*NL*
meerschaum
.
The
drama
that
was
going
on
was
almost
as
familiar
as
the
*NL*
scene
,
nevertheless
habit
had
not
made
him
indifferent
to
it
,
and
even
*NL*
in
his
present
self-absorbed
mood
,
Adam
felt
a
momentary
stirring
of
the
*NL*
old
fellow-feeling
,
as
he
looked
at
the
rough
men
painfully
holding
pen
*NL*
or
pencil
with
their
cramped
hands
,
or
humbly
labouring
through
their
*NL*
reading
lesson
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reading
class
now
seated
on
the
form
in
front
of
the
schoolmaster
's
*NL*
desk
consisted
of
the
three
most
backward
pupils
.
Adam
would
have
known
*NL*
it
only
by
seeing
Bartle
Massey
's
face
as
he
looked
over
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
which
he
had
shifted
to
the
ridge
of
his
nose
,
not
requiring
them
for
*NL*
present
purposes
.
The
face
wore
its
mildest
expression
:
the
grizzled
*NL*
bushy
eyebrows
had
taken
their
more
acute
angle
of
compassionate
*NL*
kindness
,
and
the
mouth
,
habitually
compressed
with
a
pout
of
the
lower
*NL*
lip
,
was
relaxed
so
as
to
be
ready
to
speak
a
helpful
word
or
syllable
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
This
gentle
expression
was
the
more
interesting
because
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
's
nose
,
an
irregular
aquiline
twisted
a
little
on
one
side
,
*NL*
had
rather
a
formidable
character
;
and
his
brow
,
moreover
,
had
that
*NL*
peculiar
tension
which
always
impresses
one
as
a
sign
of
a
keen
*NL*
impatient
temperament
:
the
blue
veins
stood
out
like
cords
under
the
*NL*
transparent
yellow
skin
,
and
this
intimidating
brow
was
softened
by
no
*NL*
tendency
to
baldness
,
for
the
grey
bristly
hair
,
cut
down
to
about
an
*NL*
inch
in
length
,
stood
round
it
in
as
close
ranks
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Bill
,
nay
,
''
Bartle
was
saying
in
a
kind
tone
,
as
he
nodded
to
*NL*
Adam
,
``
begin
that
again
,
and
then
perhaps
,
it
'll
come
to
you
what
d-r-y
*NL*
spells
.
It
's
the
same
lesson
you
read
last
week
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bill
''
was
a
sturdy
fellow
,
aged
four-and-twenty
,
an
excellent
*NL*
stone-sawyer
,
who
could
get
as
good
wages
as
any
man
in
the
trade
of
his
*NL*
years
;
but
he
found
a
reading
lesson
in
words
of
one
syllable
a
harder
*NL*
matter
to
deal
with
than
the
hardest
stone
he
had
ever
had
to
saw
.
The
*NL*
letters
,
he
complained
,
were
so
``
uncommon
alike
,
there
was
no
tellin
'
*NL*
'em
one
from
another
,
''
the
sawyer
's
business
not
being
concerned
with
*NL*
minute
differences
such
as
exist
between
a
letter
with
its
tail
*NL*
turned
up
and
a
letter
with
its
tail
turned
down
.
But
Bill
had
a
firm
*NL*
determination
that
he
would
learn
to
read
,
founded
chiefly
on
two
*NL*
reasons
:
first
,
that
Tom
Hazelow
,
his
cousin
,
could
read
anything
``
right
*NL*
off
,
''
whether
it
was
print
or
writing
,
and
Tom
had
sent
him
a
letter
*NL*
from
twenty
miles
off
,
saying
how
he
was
prospering
in
the
world
and
had
*NL*
got
an
overlooker
's
place
;
secondly
,
that
Sam
Phillips
,
who
sawed
with
*NL*
him
,
had
learned
to
read
when
he
was
turned
twenty
,
and
what
could
be
*NL*
done
by
a
little
fellow
like
Sam
Phillips
,
Bill
considered
,
could
*NL*
be
done
by
himself
,
seeing
that
he
could
pound
Sam
into
wet
clay
if
*NL*
circumstances
required
it
.
So
here
he
was
,
pointing
his
big
finger
*NL*
towards
three
words
at
once
,
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
that
he
*NL*
might
keep
better
hold
with
his
eye
of
the
one
word
which
was
to
be
*NL*
discriminated
out
of
the
group
.
The
amount
of
knowledge
Bartle
Massey
*NL*
must
possess
was
something
so
dim
and
vast
that
Bill
's
imagination
*NL*
recoiled
before
it
:
he
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
deny
that
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
might
have
something
to
do
in
bringing
about
the
regular
*NL*
return
of
daylight
and
the
changes
in
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
seated
next
to
Bill
was
of
a
very
different
type
:
he
was
a
*NL*
Methodist
brickmaker
who
,
after
spending
thirty
years
of
his
life
in
*NL*
perfect
satisfaction
with
his
ignorance
,
had
lately
``
got
religion
,
''
and
*NL*
along
with
it
the
desire
to
read
the
Bible
.
But
with
him
,
too
,
learning
*NL*
was
a
heavy
business
,
and
on
his
way
out
to-night
he
had
offered
as
*NL*
usual
a
special
prayer
for
help
,
seeing
that
he
had
undertaken
this
hard
*NL*
task
with
a
single
eye
to
the
nourishment
of
his
soul
--
that
he
might
*NL*
have
a
greater
abundance
of
texts
and
hymns
wherewith
to
banish
evil
*NL*
memories
and
the
temptations
of
old
habit
--
or
,
in
brief
language
,
*NL*
the
devil
.
For
the
brickmaker
had
been
a
notorious
poacher
,
and
was
*NL*
suspected
,
though
there
was
no
good
evidence
against
him
,
of
being
the
*NL*
man
who
had
shot
a
neighbouring
gamekeeper
in
the
leg
.
However
that
*NL*
might
be
,
it
is
certain
that
shortly
after
the
accident
referred
to
,
*NL*
which
was
coincident
with
the
arrival
of
an
awakening
Methodist
preacher
*NL*
at
Treddleston
,
a
great
change
had
been
observed
in
the
brickmaker
;
and
*NL*
though
he
was
still
known
in
the
neighbourhood
by
his
old
sobriquet
of
*NL*
``
Brimstone
,
''
there
was
nothing
he
held
in
so
much
horror
as
any
further
*NL*
transactions
with
that
evil-smelling
element
.
He
was
a
broad-chested
*NL*
fellow
with
a
fervid
temperament
,
which
helped
him
better
in
imbibing
*NL*
religious
ideas
than
in
the
dry
process
of
acquiring
the
mere
human
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
.
Indeed
,
he
had
been
already
a
little
shaken
*NL*
in
his
resolution
by
a
brother
Methodist
,
who
assured
him
that
the
*NL*
letter
was
a
mere
obstruction
to
the
Spirit
,
and
expressed
a
fear
that
*NL*
Brimstone
was
too
eager
for
the
knowledge
that
puffeth
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
beginner
was
a
much
more
promising
pupil
.
He
was
a
tall
but
*NL*
thin
and
wiry
man
,
nearly
as
old
as
Brimstone
,
with
a
very
pale
face
and
*NL*
hands
stained
a
deep
blue
.
He
was
a
dyer
,
who
in
the
course
of
dipping
*NL*
homespun
wool
and
old
women
's
petticoats
had
got
fired
with
the
ambition
*NL*
to
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
the
strange
secrets
of
colour
.
He
had
*NL*
already
a
high
reputation
in
the
district
for
his
dyes
,
and
he
was
*NL*
bent
on
discovering
some
method
by
which
he
could
reduce
the
expense
*NL*
of
crimsons
and
scarlets
.
The
druggist
at
Treddleston
had
given
him
a
*NL*
notion
that
he
might
save
himself
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
expense
if
*NL*
he
could
learn
to
read
,
and
so
he
had
begun
to
give
his
spare
hours
to
*NL*
the
night-school
,
resolving
that
his
``
little
chap
''
should
lose
no
time
*NL*
in
coming
to
Mr.
Massey
's
day-school
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
touching
to
see
these
three
big
men
,
with
the
marks
of
their
hard
*NL*
labour
about
them
,
anxiously
bending
over
the
worn
books
and
painfully
*NL*
making
out
,
``
The
grass
is
green
,
''
``
The
sticks
are
dry
,
''
``
The
corn
is
*NL*
ripe
''
--
a
very
hard
lesson
to
pass
to
after
columns
of
single
words
*NL*
all
alike
except
in
the
first
letter
.
It
was
almost
as
if
three
rough
*NL*
animals
were
making
humble
efforts
to
learn
how
they
might
become
human
.
*NL*
And
it
touched
the
tenderest
fibre
in
Bartle
Massey
's
nature
,
for
such
*NL*
full-grown
children
as
these
were
the
only
pupils
for
whom
he
had
*NL*
no
severe
epithets
and
no
impatient
tones
.
He
was
not
gifted
with
an
*NL*
imperturbable
temper
,
and
on
music-nights
it
was
apparent
that
patience
*NL*
could
never
be
an
easy
virtue
to
him
;
but
this
evening
,
as
he
glances
*NL*
over
his
spectacles
at
Bill
Downes
,
the
sawyer
,
who
is
turning
his
*NL*
head
on
one
side
with
a
desperate
sense
of
blankness
before
the
letters
*NL*
d-r-y
,
his
eyes
shed
their
mildest
and
most
encouraging
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
reading
class
,
two
youths
between
sixteen
and
nineteen
came
up
*NL*
with
the
imaginary
bills
of
parcels
,
which
they
had
been
writing
out
on
*NL*
their
slates
and
were
now
required
to
calculate
``
off-hand
''
--
a
test
which
*NL*
they
stood
with
such
imperfect
success
that
Bartle
Massey
,
whose
eyes
*NL*
had
been
glaring
at
them
ominously
through
his
spectacles
for
some
*NL*
minutes
,
at
length
burst
out
in
a
bitter
,
high-pitched
tone
,
pausing
*NL*
between
every
sentence
to
rap
the
floor
with
a
knobbed
stick
which
*NL*
rested
between
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
see
,
you
do
n't
do
this
thing
a
bit
better
than
you
did
a
*NL*
fortnight
ago
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
's
the
reason
.
You
want
to
learn
*NL*
accounts
--
that
's
well
and
good
.
But
you
think
all
you
need
do
to
learn
*NL*
accounts
is
to
come
to
me
and
do
sums
for
an
hour
or
so
,
two
or
three
*NL*
times
a-week
;
and
no
sooner
do
you
get
your
caps
on
and
turn
out
of
*NL*
doors
again
than
you
sweep
the
whole
thing
clean
out
of
your
mind
.
You
*NL*
go
whistling
about
,
and
take
no
more
care
what
you
're
thinking
of
*NL*
than
if
your
heads
were
gutters
for
any
rubbish
to
swill
through
that
*NL*
happened
to
be
in
the
way
;
and
if
you
get
a
good
notion
in
'em
,
*NL*
it
's
pretty
soon
washed
out
again
.
You
think
knowledge
is
to
be
got
*NL*
cheap
--
you
'll
come
and
pay
Bartle
Massey
sixpence
a-week
,
and
he
'll
make
*NL*
you
clever
at
figures
without
your
taking
any
trouble
.
But
knowledge
*NL*
is
n't
to
be
got
with
paying
sixpence
,
let
me
tell
you
.
If
you
're
to
know
*NL*
figures
,
you
must
turn
'em
over
in
your
heads
and
keep
your
thoughts
*NL*
fixed
on
'em
.
There
's
nothing
you
ca
n't
turn
into
a
sum
,
for
there
's
*NL*
nothing
but
what
's
got
number
in
it
--
even
a
fool
.
You
may
say
to
*NL*
yourselves
,
`
I
'm
one
fool
,
and
Jack
's
another
;
if
my
fool
's
head
weighed
*NL*
four
pound
,
and
Jack
's
three
pound
three
ounces
and
three
quarters
,
how
*NL*
many
pennyweights
heavier
would
my
head
be
than
Jack
's
?
'
A
man
that
had
*NL*
got
his
heart
in
learning
figures
would
make
sums
for
himself
and
work
*NL*
'em
in
his
head
.
When
he
sat
at
his
shoemaking
,
he
'd
count
his
stitches
*NL*
by
fives
,
and
then
put
a
price
on
his
stitches
,
say
half
a
farthing
,
and
*NL*
then
see
how
much
money
he
could
get
in
an
hour
;
and
then
ask
himself
*NL*
how
much
money
he
'd
get
in
a
day
at
that
rate
;
and
then
how
much
ten
*NL*
workmen
would
get
working
three
,
or
twenty
,
or
a
hundred
years
at
that
*NL*
rate
--
and
all
the
while
his
needle
would
be
going
just
as
fast
as
if
*NL*
he
left
his
head
empty
for
the
devil
to
dance
in
.
But
the
long
and
the
*NL*
short
of
it
is
--
I
'll
have
nobody
in
my
night-school
that
does
n't
strive
*NL*
to
learn
what
he
comes
to
learn
,
as
hard
as
if
he
was
striving
to
get
*NL*
out
of
a
dark
hole
into
broad
daylight
.
I
'll
send
no
man
away
because
*NL*
he
's
stupid
:
if
Billy
Taft
,
the
idiot
,
wanted
to
learn
anything
,
I
'd
not
*NL*
refuse
to
teach
him
.
But
I
'll
not
throw
away
good
knowledge
on
people
*NL*
who
think
they
can
get
it
by
the
sixpenn
`
orth
,
and
carry
it
away
with
*NL*
'em
as
they
would
an
ounce
of
snuff
.
So
never
come
to
me
again
,
if
you
*NL*
ca
n't
show
that
you
've
been
working
with
your
own
heads
,
instead
of
*NL*
thinking
that
you
can
pay
for
mine
to
work
for
you
.
That
's
the
last
word
*NL*
I
've
got
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
final
sentence
,
Bartle
Massey
gave
a
sharper
rap
than
ever
*NL*
with
his
knobbed
stick
,
and
the
discomfited
lads
got
up
to
go
with
a
*NL*
sulky
look
.
The
other
pupils
had
happily
only
their
writing-books
to
*NL*
show
,
in
various
stages
of
progress
from
pot-hooks
to
round
text
;
and
*NL*
mere
pen-strokes
,
however
perverse
,
were
less
exasperating
to
Bartle
*NL*
than
false
arithmetic
.
He
was
a
little
more
severe
than
usual
on
Jacob
*NL*
Storey
's
Z
's
,
of
which
poor
Jacob
had
written
a
pageful
,
all
with
their
*NL*
tops
turned
the
wrong
way
,
with
a
puzzled
sense
that
they
were
not
right
*NL*
``
somehow
.
''
But
he
observed
in
apology
,
that
it
was
a
letter
you
never
*NL*
wanted
hardly
,
and
he
thought
it
had
only
been
there
``
to
finish
off
th
'
*NL*
alphabet
,
like
,
though
ampusand
-LRB-
&
-RRB-
would
ha
'
done
as
well
,
for
what
he
*NL*
could
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
pupils
had
all
taken
their
hats
and
said
their
*NL*
``
Good-nights
,
''
and
Adam
,
knowing
his
old
master
's
habits
,
rose
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Shall
I
put
the
candles
out
,
Mr.
Massey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes
,
all
but
this
,
which
I
'll
carry
into
the
house
;
and
*NL*
just
lock
the
outer
door
,
now
you
're
near
it
,
''
said
Bartle
,
getting
his
*NL*
stick
in
the
fitting
angle
to
help
him
in
descending
from
his
stool
.
*NL*
He
was
no
sooner
on
the
ground
than
it
became
obvious
why
the
stick
*NL*
was
necessary
--
the
left
leg
was
much
shorter
than
the
right
.
But
the
*NL*
school-master
was
so
active
with
his
lameness
that
it
was
hardly
thought
*NL*
of
as
a
misfortune
;
and
if
you
had
seen
him
make
his
way
along
the
*NL*
schoolroom
floor
,
and
up
the
step
into
his
kitchen
,
you
would
perhaps
*NL*
have
understood
why
the
naughty
boys
sometimes
felt
that
his
pace
might
*NL*
be
indefinitely
quickened
and
that
he
and
his
stick
might
overtake
them
*NL*
even
in
their
swiftest
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
he
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
with
the
candle
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
a
faint
whimpering
began
in
the
chimney-corner
,
and
a
*NL*
brown-and-tan-coloured
bitch
,
of
that
wise-looking
breed
with
short
legs
*NL*
and
long
body
,
known
to
an
unmechanical
generation
as
turnspits
,
came
*NL*
creeping
along
the
floor
,
wagging
her
tail
,
and
hesitating
at
every
*NL*
other
step
,
as
if
her
affections
were
painfully
divided
between
the
*NL*
hamper
in
the
chimney-corner
and
the
master
,
whom
she
could
not
leave
*NL*
without
a
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Vixen
,
well
then
,
how
are
the
babbies
?
''
said
the
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
making
haste
towards
the
chimney-corner
and
holding
the
candle
over
*NL*
the
low
hamper
,
where
two
extremely
blind
puppies
lifted
up
their
heads
*NL*
towards
the
light
from
a
nest
of
flannel
and
wool
.
Vixen
could
not
even
*NL*
see
her
master
look
at
them
without
painful
excitement
:
she
got
into
the
*NL*
hamper
and
got
out
again
the
next
moment
,
and
behaved
with
true
feminine
*NL*
folly
,
though
looking
all
the
while
as
wise
as
a
dwarf
with
a
large
*NL*
old-fashioned
head
and
body
on
the
most
abbreviated
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
've
got
a
family
,
I
see
,
Mr.
Massey
?
''
said
Adam
,
smiling
,
as
*NL*
he
came
into
the
kitchen
.
``
How
's
that
?
I
thought
it
was
against
the
law
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Law
?
What
's
the
use
o
'
law
when
a
man
's
once
such
a
fool
as
to
let
a
*NL*
woman
into
his
house
?
''
said
Bartle
,
turning
away
from
the
hamper
with
*NL*
some
bitterness
.
He
always
called
Vixen
a
woman
,
and
seemed
to
have
lost
*NL*
all
consciousness
that
he
was
using
a
figure
of
speech
.
``
If
I
'd
known
*NL*
Vixen
was
a
woman
,
I
'd
never
have
held
the
boys
from
drowning
her
;
but
*NL*
when
I
'd
got
her
into
my
hand
,
I
was
forced
to
take
to
her
.
And
now
you
*NL*
see
what
she
's
brought
me
to
--
the
sly
,
hypocritical
wench
''
--
Bartle
spoke
*NL*
these
last
words
in
a
rasping
tone
of
reproach
,
and
looked
at
Vixen
,
who
*NL*
poked
down
her
head
and
turned
up
her
eyes
towards
him
with
a
keen
*NL*
sense
of
opprobrium
--
``
and
contrived
to
be
brought
to
bed
on
a
Sunday
at
*NL*
church-time
.
I
've
wished
again
and
again
I
'd
been
a
bloody
minded
man
,
*NL*
that
I
could
have
strangled
the
mother
and
the
brats
with
one
cord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
it
was
no
worse
a
cause
kept
you
from
church
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
I
*NL*
was
afraid
you
must
be
ill
for
the
first
time
i
'
your
life
.
And
I
was
*NL*
particularly
sorry
not
to
have
you
at
church
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
boy
,
I
know
why
,
I
know
why
,
''
said
Bartle
kindly
,
going
up
to
*NL*
Adam
and
raising
his
hand
up
to
the
shoulder
that
was
almost
on
a
level
*NL*
with
his
own
head
.
``
You
've
had
a
rough
bit
o
'
road
to
get
over
since
I
*NL*
saw
you
--
a
rough
bit
o
'
road
.
But
I
'm
in
hopes
there
are
better
times
*NL*
coming
for
you
.
I
've
got
some
news
to
tell
you
.
But
I
must
get
my
supper
*NL*
first
,
for
I
'm
hungry
,
I
'm
hungry
.
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bartel
went
into
his
little
pantry
,
and
brought
out
an
excellent
*NL*
home-baked
loaf
;
for
it
was
his
one
extravagance
in
these
dear
times
*NL*
to
eat
bread
once
a-day
instead
of
oat-cake
;
and
he
justified
it
by
*NL*
observing
,
that
what
a
schoolmaster
wanted
was
brains
,
and
oat-cake
ran
*NL*
too
much
to
bone
instead
of
brains
.
Then
came
a
piece
of
cheese
and
a
*NL*
quart
jug
with
a
crown
of
foam
upon
it
.
He
placed
them
all
on
the
*NL*
round
deal
table
which
stood
against
his
large
arm-chair
in
the
*NL*
chimney-corner
,
with
Vixen
's
hamper
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
window-shelf
*NL*
with
a
few
books
piled
up
in
it
on
the
other
.
The
table
was
as
clean
as
*NL*
if
Vixen
had
been
an
excellent
housewife
in
a
checkered
apron
;
so
was
*NL*
the
quarry
floor
;
and
the
old
carved
oaken
press
,
table
,
and
chairs
,
*NL*
which
in
these
days
would
be
bought
at
a
high
price
in
aristocratic
*NL*
houses
,
though
,
in
that
period
of
spider-legs
and
inlaid
cupids
,
Bartle
*NL*
had
got
them
for
an
old
song
,
where
as
free
from
dust
as
things
could
be
*NL*
at
the
end
of
a
summer
's
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
my
boy
,
draw
up
,
draw
up
.
We
'll
not
talk
about
business
till
*NL*
we
've
had
our
supper
.
No
man
can
be
wise
on
an
empty
stomach
.
But
,
''
said
*NL*
Bartle
,
rising
from
his
chair
again
,
``
I
must
give
Vixen
her
supper
*NL*
too
,
confound
her
!
Though
she
'll
do
nothing
with
it
but
nourish
those
*NL*
unnecessary
babbies
.
That
's
the
way
with
these
women
--
they
've
got
no
*NL*
head-pieces
to
nourish
,
and
so
their
food
all
runs
either
to
fat
or
to
*NL*
brats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
brought
out
of
the
pantry
a
dish
of
scraps
,
which
Vixen
at
once
fixed
*NL*
her
eyes
on
,
and
jumped
out
of
her
hamper
to
lick
up
with
the
utmost
*NL*
dispatch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
my
supper
,
Mr.
Massey
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
so
I
'll
look
on
while
you
*NL*
eat
yours

I
've
been
at
the
Hall
Farm

they
always
have
their
supper
*NL*
betimes
,
you
know
:
they
do
n't
keep
your
late
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
little
about
their
hours
,
''
said
Bartle
dryly
,
cutting
his
bread
*NL*
and
not
shrinking
from
the
crust
.
``
It
's
a
house
I
seldom
go
into
,
though
*NL*
I
'm
fond
of
the
boys
,
and
Martin
Poyser
's
a
good
fellow
.
There
's
too
*NL*
many
women
in
the
house
for
me
:
I
hate
the
sound
of
women
's
voices
;
*NL*
they
're
always
either
a-buzz
or
a-squeak
--
always
either
a-buzz
or
*NL*
a-squeak
.
Mrs.
Poyser
keeps
at
the
top
o

the
talk
like
a
fife
;
and
*NL*
as
for
the
young
lasses
,
I
'd
as
soon
look
at
water-grubs
.
I
know
what
*NL*
they
'll
turn
to

stinging
gnats

stinging
gnats

Here

take
some
ale

my

boy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

Mr.
Massey

said
Adam
,
who
took
his
old
friend
's
whim
more
*NL*
seriously
than
usual
to-night
,
``
do
n't
be
so
hard
on

made

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

It
's
the
silliest
lie
a
sensible
man
like
you
ever
believed
,
*NL*
to
say
a
woman
makes
a
house
comfortable
.
It
's
a
story
got
up
because
*NL*
the
women
are
there
and
something
must
be
found
for
'em
to
do

I
tell
*NL*
you
there
is
n't
a
thing
under
the
sun
that
needs
to

*NL*
what
a

can
do
better
than
a
woman

unless
it
's
bearing
children

*NL*
they
do
that
in
a
poor
make-shift
way

it
had
better

it
had
better
ha

been
left
to

I
tell

a

bake
you
a

every

the
shorter

I
tell

make

your
porridge
every

for
twenty
years

never
think
of
measuring
*NL*
the
proportion
between
the
meal
and
the
milk
--
a
little
more
or
less
,
*NL*
she
'll
think

does
n't

The
porridge
WILL
be
awk

now

*NL*
then
:
if
it
's
wrong

it
's
summat
in

or
it
's
summat
in
the
*NL*
milk
,
or
it
's
summat
in
the
water

Look
at
me
!
I
make
my
own
bread
,
and
*NL*
there
's
no
difference
between
one
batch
and
another
from
year
's
end
to
*NL*
year
's
end
;
but
if
I
'd
got
any
other
woman
besides
Vixen
in
the
house
,
*NL*
I
must
pray
to
the
Lord
every
baking
to
give
me
patience
if
the
bread
*NL*
turned
out
heavy
.
And
as
for
cleanliness
,
my
house
is
cleaner
than
any
*NL*
other
house
on
the
Common

though
the
half
of
'em
swarm
with

we
get
as
much
cleaning

done
in
one
hour
,
without
any
fuss

as

and
all

be
sending
buckets

water
after
your

let
*NL*
the

and
the
fire-irons
stand
in
the
middle
o

the
floor
half
the
*NL*
day
for
you
to
break
your
shins
against
'em

Do
n't
tell
me
about
God
*NL*
having
made
such
creatures
to
be
companions
for
us
!
I
do
n't

but
*NL*
He
might
make
Eve
to
be
a
companion
to
Adam
in
Paradise

there
was
no

spoilt
there

mischief

though
you
see
what
mischief
she
did
as
soon
as
she
'd
an

But
it
's
an
impious

unscriptural
opinion
to
say
a

*NL*
a

you

Bartle
had
become

excited

angry
in

course

his
invective
*NL*
that
he
had
forgotten
his

for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
rapping
the
table
with
the
haft
.
But
towards
the
close
,
the
*NL*
raps
became
so
sharp
and
frequent
,
and
his
voice
so
quarrelsome
,
that
*NL*
Vixen
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
jump
out
of
the
hamper
and
bark
*NL*
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quiet
,
Vixen
!
''
snarled
Bartle
,
turning
round
upon
her
.
``
You
're
like
the
*NL*
rest
o
'
the
women
--
always
putting
in
your
word
before
you
know
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vixen
returned
to
her
hamper
again
in
humiliation
,
and
her
master
*NL*
continued
his
supper
in
a
silence
which
Adam
did
not
choose
to
*NL*
interrupt
;
he
knew
the
old
man
would
be
in
a
better
humour
when
he
had
*NL*
had
his
supper
and
lighted
his
pipe
.
Adam
was
used
to
hear
him
talk
in
*NL*
this
way
,
but
had
never
learned
so
much
of
Bartle
's
past
life
as
to
know
*NL*
whether
his
view
of
married
comfort
was
founded
on
experience
.
On
that
*NL*
point
Bartle
was
mute
,
and
it
was
even
a
secret
where
he
had
lived
*NL*
previous
to
the
twenty
years
in
which
happily
for
the
peasants
and
*NL*
artisans
of
this
neighbourhood
he
had
been
settled
among
them
as
their
*NL*
only
schoolmaster
.
If
anything
like
a
question
was
ventured
on
this
*NL*
subject
,
Bartle
always
replied
,
``
Oh
,
I
've
seen
many
places
--
I
've
been
a
*NL*
deal
in
the
south
,
''
and
the
Loamshire
men
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
*NL*
asking
for
a
particular
town
or
village
in
Africa
as
in
``
the
south
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
my
boy
,
''
said
Bartle
,
at
last
,
when
he
had
poured
out
his
*NL*
second
mug
of
ale
and
lighted
his
pipe
,
``
now
then
,
we
'll
have
a
little
*NL*
talk
.
But
tell
me
first
,
have
you
heard
any
particular
news
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
not
as
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
they
'll
keep
it
close
,
they
'll
keep
it
close
,
I
daresay
.
But
I
*NL*
found
it
out
by
chance
;
and
it
's
news
that
may
concern
you
,
Adam
,
else
*NL*
I
'm
a
man
that
do
n't
know
a
superficial
square
foot
from
a
solid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Bartle
gave
a
series
of
fierce
and
rapid
puffs
,
looking
earnestly
*NL*
the
while
at
Adam
.
Your
impatient
loquacious
man
has
never
any
notion
of
*NL*
keeping
his
pipe
alight
by
gentle
measured
puffs
;
he
is
always
letting
*NL*
it
go
nearly
out
,
and
then
punishing
it
for
that
negligence
.
At
last
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Satchell
's
got
a
paralytic
stroke
.
I
found
it
out
from
the
lad
*NL*
they
sent
to
Treddleston
for
the
doctor
,
before
seven
o'clock
this
*NL*
morning
.
He
's
a
good
way
beyond
sixty
,
you
know
;
it
's
much
if
he
gets
*NL*
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
I
daresay
there
'd
be
more
rejoicing
than
sorrow
*NL*
in
the
parish
at
his
being
laid
up
.
He
's
been
a
selfish
,
tale-bearing
,
*NL*
mischievous
fellow
;
but
,
after
all
,
there
's
nobody
he
's
done
so
much
*NL*
harm
to
as
to
th
'
old
squire
.
Though
it
's
the
squire
himself
as
is
to
*NL*
blame
--
making
a
stupid
fellow
like
that
a
sort
o
'
man-of-all-work
,
just
*NL*
to
save
th
'
expense
of
having
a
proper
steward
to
look
after
th
'
estate
.
*NL*
And
he
's
lost
more
by
ill
management
o
'
the
woods
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
than
*NL*
`
ud
pay
for
two
stewards
.
If
he
's
laid
on
the
shelf
,
it
's
to
be
hoped
*NL*
he
'll
make
way
for
a
better
man
,
but
I
do
n't
see
how
it
's
like
to
make
*NL*
any
difference
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
see
it
,
but
I
see
it
,
''
said
Bartle
,
``
and
others
besides
me
.
The
*NL*
captain
's
coming
of
age
now
--
you
know
that
as
well
as
I
do
--
and
it
's
to
*NL*
be
expected
he
'll
have
a
little
more
voice
in
things
.
And
I
know
,
and
*NL*
you
know
too
,
what
`
ud
be
the
captain
's
wish
about
the
woods
,
if
there
*NL*
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
making
a
change
.
He
's
said
in
plenty
of
*NL*
people
's
hearing
that
he
'd
make
you
manager
of
the
woods
to-morrow
,
if
*NL*
he
'd
the
power
.
Why
,
Carroll
,
Mr.
Irwine
's
butler
,
heard
him
say
so
to
*NL*
the
parson
not
many
days
ago
.
Carroll
looked
in
when
we
were
smoking
*NL*
our
pipes
o
'
Saturday
night
at
Casson
's
,
and
he
told
us
about
it
;
and
*NL*
whenever
anybody
says
a
good
word
for
you
,
the
parson
's
ready
to
back
*NL*
it
,
that
I
'll
answer
for
.
It
was
pretty
well
talked
over
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
,
at
Casson
's
,
and
one
and
another
had
their
fling
at
you
;
for
if
*NL*
donkeys
set
to
work
to
sing
,
you
're
pretty
sure
what
the
tune
'll
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
they
talk
it
over
before
Mr.
Burge
?
''
said
Adam
;
``
or
was
n't
he
*NL*
there
o
'
Saturday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
went
away
before
Carroll
came
;
and
Casson
--
he
's
always
for
*NL*
setting
other
folks
right
,
you
know
--
would
have
it
Burge
was
the
man
to
*NL*
have
the
management
of
the
woods
.
'
A
substantial
man
,
'
says
he
,
`
with
*NL*
pretty
near
sixty
years
'
experience
o
'
timber
:
it
`
ud
be
all
very
well
*NL*
for
Adam
Bede
to
act
under
him
,
but
it
is
n't
to
be
supposed
the
squire
*NL*
`
ud
appoint
a
young
fellow
like
Adam
,
when
there
's
his
elders
and
*NL*
betters
at
hand
!
'
But
I
said
,
`
That
's
a
pretty
notion
o
'
yours
,
Casson
.
*NL*
Why
,
Burge
is
the
man
to
buy
timber
;
would
you
put
the
woods
into
his
*NL*
hands
and
let
him
make
his
own
bargains
?
I
think
you
do
n't
leave
your
*NL*
customers
to
score
their
own
drink
,
do
you
?
And
as
for
age
,
what
that
's
*NL*
worth
depends
on
the
quality
o
'
the
liquor
.
It
's
pretty
well
known
who
's
*NL*
the
backbone
of
Jonathan
Burge
's
business
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
for
your
good
word
,
Mr.
Massey
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
But
,
for
*NL*
all
that
,
Casson
was
partly
i
'
the
right
for
once
.
There
's
not
much
*NL*
likelihood
that
th
'
old
squire
`
ud
ever
consent
t
'
employ
me
.
I
offended
*NL*
him
about
two
years
ago
,
and
he
's
never
forgiven
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
was
that
?
You
never
told
me
about
it
,
''
said
Bartle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
a
bit
o
'
nonsense
.
I
'd
made
a
frame
for
a
screen
for
*NL*
Miss
Lyddy
--
she
's
allays
making
something
with
her
worsted-work
,
you
*NL*
know
--
and
she
'd
given
me
particular
orders
about
this
screen
,
and
there
*NL*
was
as
much
talking
and
measuring
as
if
we
'd
been
planning
a
house
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
a
nice
bit
o
'
work
,
and
I
liked
doing
it
for
her
.
But
,
*NL*
you
know
,
those
little
friggling
things
take
a
deal
o
'
time
.
I
only
*NL*
worked
at
it
in
overhours
--
often
late
at
night
--
and
I
had
to
go
to
*NL*
Treddleston
over
an
'
over
again
about
little
bits
o
'
brass
nails
and
*NL*
such
gear
;
and
I
turned
the
little
knobs
and
the
legs
,
and
carved
th
'
*NL*
open
work
,
after
a
pattern
,
as
nice
as
could
be
.
And
I
was
uncommon
*NL*
pleased
with
it
when
it
was
done
.
And
when
I
took
it
home
,
Miss
Lyddy
*NL*
sent
for
me
to
bring
it
into
her
drawing-room
,
so
as
she
might
give
me
*NL*
directions
about
fastening
on
the
work
--
very
fine
needlework
,
Jacob
and
*NL*
Rachel
a-kissing
one
another
among
the
sheep
,
like
a
picture
--
and
th
'
*NL*
old
squire
was
sitting
there
,
for
he
mostly
sits
with
her
.
Well
,
she
was
*NL*
mighty
pleased
with
the
screen
,
and
then
she
wanted
to
know
what
pay
she
*NL*
was
to
give
me
.
I
did
n't
speak
at
random
--
you
know
it
's
not
my
way
;
I
'd
*NL*
calculated
pretty
close
,
though
I
had
n't
made
out
a
bill
,
and
I
said
,
*NL*
`
One
pound
thirty
.
'
That
was
paying
for
the
mater
`
als
and
paying
me
,
but
*NL*
none
too
much
,
for
my
work
.
Th
'
old
squire
looked
up
at
this
,
and
peered
*NL*
in
his
way
at
the
screen
,
and
said
,
`
One
pound
thirteen
for
a
gimcrack
*NL*
like
that
!
Lydia
,
my
dear
,
if
you
must
spend
money
on
these
things
,
*NL*
why
do
n't
you
get
them
at
Rosseter
,
instead
of
paying
double
price
for
*NL*
clumsy
work
here
?
Such
things
are
not
work
for
a
carpenter
like
Adam
.
*NL*
Give
him
a
guinea
,
and
no
more
.
'
Well
,
Miss
Lyddy
,
I
reckon
,
believed
*NL*
what
he
told
her
,
and
she
's
not
overfond
o
'
parting
with
the
money
*NL*
herself
--
she
's
not
a
bad
woman
at
bottom
,
but
she
's
been
brought
up
*NL*
under
his
thumb
;
so
she
began
fidgeting
with
her
purse
,
and
turned
as
*NL*
red
as
her
ribbon
.
But
I
made
a
bow
,
and
said
,
`
No
,
thank
you
,
madam
;
*NL*
I
'll
make
you
a
present
o
'
the
screen
,
if
you
please
.
I
've
charged
*NL*
the
regular
price
for
my
work
,
and
I
know
it
's
done
well
;
and
I
know
,
*NL*
begging
His
Honour
's
pardon
,
that
you
could
n't
get
such
a
screen
at
*NL*
Rosseter
under
two
guineas
.
I
'm
willing
to
give
you
my
work
--
it
's
been
*NL*
done
in
my
own
time
,
and
nobody
's
got
anything
to
do
with
it
but
me
;
but
*NL*
if
I
'm
paid
,
I
ca
n't
take
a
smaller
price
than
I
asked
,
because
that
*NL*
`
ud
be
like
saying
I
'd
asked
more
than
was
just
.
With
your
leave
,
madam
,
*NL*
I
'll
bid
you
good-morning
.
'
I
made
my
bow
and
went
out
before
she
'd
*NL*
time
to
say
any
more
,
for
she
stood
with
the
purse
in
her
hand
,
looking
*NL*
almost
foolish
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
disrespectful
,
and
I
spoke
as
polite
*NL*
as
I
could
;
but
I
can
give
in
to
no
man
,
if
he
wants
to
make
it
out
as
*NL*
I
'm
trying
to
overreach
him
.
And
in
the
evening
the
footman
brought
me
*NL*
the
one
pound
thirteen
wrapped
in
paper
.
But
since
then
I
've
seen
pretty
*NL*
clear
as
th
'
old
squire
ca
n't
abide
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
likely
enough
,
that
's
likely
enough
,
''
said
Bartle
meditatively
.
*NL*
``
The
only
way
to
bring
him
round
would
be
to
show
him
what
was
for
his
*NL*
own
interest
,
and
that
the
captain
may
do
--
that
the
captain
may
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Adam
;
``
the
squire
's
`
cute
enough
but
it
takes
*NL*
something
else
besides
`
cuteness
to
make
folks
see
what
'll
be
their
*NL*
interest
in
the
long
run
.
It
takes
some
conscience
and
belief
in
right
*NL*
and
wrong
,
I
see
that
pretty
clear
.
You
'd
hardly
ever
bring
round
th
'
*NL*
old
squire
to
believe
he
'd
gain
as
much
in
a
straightfor
`
ard
way
as
by
*NL*
tricks
and
turns
.
And
,
besides
,
I
've
not
much
mind
to
work
under
him
:
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
any
gentleman
,
more
particular
an
old
*NL*
gentleman
turned
eighty
,
and
I
know
we
could
n't
agree
long
.
If
the
*NL*
captain
was
master
o
'
th
'
estate
,
it
`
ud
be
different
:
he
's
got
a
*NL*
conscience
and
a
will
to
do
right
,
and
I
'd
sooner
work
for
him
nor
for
*NL*
any
man
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
my
boy
,
if
good
luck
knocks
at
your
door
,
do
n't
you
put
*NL*
your
head
out
at
window
and
tell
it
to
be
gone
about
its
business
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
You
must
learn
to
deal
with
odd
and
even
in
life
,
as
well
*NL*
as
in
figures
.
I
tell
you
now
,
as
I
told
you
ten
years
ago
,
when
you
*NL*
pommelled
young
Mike
Holdsworth
for
wanting
to
pass
a
bad
shilling
*NL*
before
you
knew
whether
he
was
in
jest
or
earnest
--
you
're
overhasty
and
*NL*
proud
,
and
apt
to
set
your
teeth
against
folks
that
do
n't
square
to
your
*NL*
notions
.
It
's
no
harm
for
me
to
be
a
bit
fiery
and
stiff-backed
--
I
'm
an
*NL*
old
schoolmaster
,
and
shall
never
want
to
get
on
to
a
higher
perch
.
But
*NL*
where
's
the
use
of
all
the
time
I
've
spent
in
teaching
you
writing
and
*NL*
mapping
and
mensuration
,
if
you
're
not
to
get
for
`
ard
in
the
world
and
*NL*
show
folks
there
's
some
advantage
in
having
a
head
on
your
shoulders
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
turnip
?
Do
you
mean
to
go
on
turning
up
your
nose
at
every
*NL*
opportunity
because
it
's
got
a
bit
of
a
smell
about
it
that
nobody
finds
*NL*
out
but
yourself
?
It
's
as
foolish
as
that
notion
o
'
yours
that
a
wife
*NL*
is
to
make
a
working-man
comfortable
.
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
Stuff
and
*NL*
nonsense
!
Leave
that
to
fools
that
never
got
beyond
a
sum
in
simple
*NL*
addition
.
Simple
addition
enough
!
Add
one
fool
to
another
fool
,
and
in
*NL*
six
years
'
time
six
fools
more
--
they
're
all
of
the
same
denomination
,
*NL*
big
and
little

nothing
to
do
with
the
sum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
rather
heated
exhortation
to
coolness
and
discretion
the
*NL*
pipe
had
gone
out
,
and
Bartle
gave
the
climax
to
his
speech
by
striking
*NL*
a
light
furiously
,
after
which
he
puffed
with
fierce
resolution
,
fixing
*NL*
his
eye
still
on
Adam
,
who
was
trying
not
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
good
deal
o
'
sense
in
what
you
say
,
Mr.
Massey
,
''
Adam
began
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
felt
quite
serious
,
``
as
there
always
is
.
But
you
'll
give
*NL*
in
that
it
's
no
business
o
'
mine
to
be
building
on
chances
that
may
*NL*
never
happen
.
What
I
've
got
to
do
is
to
work
as
well
as
I
can
with
the
*NL*
tools
and
mater
`
als
I
've
got
in
my
hands
.
If
a
good
chance
comes
to
me
,
*NL*
I
'll
think
o
'
what
you
've
been
saying
;
but
till
then
,
I
've
got
nothing
*NL*
to
do
but
to
trust
to
my
own
hands
and
my
own
head-piece
.
I
'm
turning
*NL*
over
a
little
plan
for
Seth
and
me
to
go
into
the
cabinet-making
a
bit
*NL*
by
ourselves
,
and
win
a
extra
pound
or
two
in
that
way
.
But
it
's
getting
*NL*
late
now
--
it
'll
be
pretty
near
eleven
before
I
'm
at
home
,
and
Mother
may
*NL*
happen
to
lie
awake
;
she
's
more
fidgety
nor
usual
now
.
So
I
'll
bid
you
*NL*
good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
we
'll
go
to
the
gate
with
you
--
it
's
a
fine
night
,
''
said
*NL*
Bartle
,
taking
up
his
stick
.
Vixen
was
at
once
on
her
legs
,
and
without
*NL*
further
words
the
three
walked
out
into
the
starlight
,
by
the
side
of
*NL*
Bartle
's
potato-beds
,
to
the
little
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
the
music
o
'
Friday
night
,
if
you
can
,
my
boy
,
''
said
the
old
*NL*
man
,
as
he
closed
the
gate
after
Adam
and
leaned
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Adam
,
striding
along
towards
the
streak
of
pale
road
.
*NL*
He
was
the
only
object
moving
on
the
wide
common
.
The
two
grey
donkeys
,
*NL*
just
visible
in
front
of
the
gorse
bushes
,
stood
as
still
as
limestone
*NL*
images
--
as
still
as
the
grey-thatched
roof
of
the
mud
cottage
a
little
*NL*
farther
on
.
Bartle
kept
his
eye
on
the
moving
figure
till
it
passed
into
*NL*
the
darkness
,
while
Vixen
,
in
a
state
of
divided
affection
,
had
twice
*NL*
run
back
to
the
house
to
bestow
a
parenthetic
lick
on
her
puppies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
muttered
the
schoolmaster
,
as
Adam
disappeared
,
``
there
you
*NL*
go
,
stalking
along
--
stalking
along
;
but
you
would
n't
have
been
what
you
*NL*
are
if
you
had
n't
had
a
bit
of
old
lame
Bartle
inside
you

The
strongest

have

to

Vixen
tucked

Going
to
the
Birthday
Feast
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
thirtieth
of
July
was
come
,
and
it
was
one
of
those
half-dozen
warm
*NL*
days
which
sometimes
occur
in
the
middle
of
a
rainy
English
summer
.
No
*NL*
rain
had
fallen
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
,
and
the
weather
was
*NL*
perfect
for
that
time
of
the
year
:
there
was
less
dust
than
usual
on
*NL*
the
dark-green
hedge-rows
and
on
the
wild
camomile
that
starred
the
*NL*
roadside
,
yet
the
grass
was
dry
enough
for
the
little
children
to
roll
*NL*
on
it
,
and
there
was
no
cloud
but
a
long
dash
of
light
,
downy
ripple
,
*NL*
high
,
high
up
in
the
far-off
blue
sky
.
Perfect
weather
for
an
outdoor
*NL*
July
merry-making
,
yet
surely
not
the
best
time
of
year
to
be
born
in
.
*NL*
Nature
seems
to
make
a
hot
pause
just
then
:
all
the
loveliest
flowers
*NL*
are
gone
;
the
sweet
time
of
early
growth
and
vague
hopes
is
past
;
and
*NL*
yet
the
time
of
harvest
and
ingathering
is
not
come
,
and
we
tremble
at
*NL*
the
possible
storms
that
may
ruin
the
precious
fruit
in
the
moment
*NL*
of
its
ripeness
.
The
woods
are
all
one
dark
monotonous
green
;
the
*NL*
waggon-loads
of
hay
no
longer
creep
along
the
lanes
,
scattering
their
*NL*
sweet-smelling
fragments
on
the
blackberry
branches
;
the
pastures
are
*NL*
often
a
little
tanned
,
yet
the
corn
has
not
got
its
last
splendour
*NL*
of
red
and
gold
;
the
lambs
and
calves
have
lost
all
traces
of
their
*NL*
innocent
frisky
prettiness
,
and
have
become
stupid
young
sheep
and
cows
.
*NL*
But
it
is
a
time
of
leisure
on
the
farm
--
that
pause
between
hay-and
*NL*
corn-harvest
,
and
so
the
farmers
and
labourers
in
Hayslope
and
Broxton
*NL*
thought
the
captain
did
well
to
come
of
age
just
then
,
when
they
could
*NL*
give
their
undivided
minds
to
the
flavour
of
the
great
cask
of
ale
which
*NL*
had
been
brewed
the
autumn
after
``
the
heir
''
was
born
,
and
was
to
be
*NL*
tapped
on
his
twenty-first
birthday
.
The
air
had
been
merry
with
the
*NL*
ringing
of
church-bells
very
early
this
morning
,
and
every
one
had
made
*NL*
haste
to
get
through
the
needful
work
before
twelve
,
when
it
would
be
*NL*
time
to
think
of
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
Chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
midday
sun
was
streaming
into
Hetty
's
bedchamber
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
blind
to
temper
the
heat
with
which
it
fell
on
her
head
as
she
looked
at
*NL*
herself
in
the
old
specked
glass
.
Still
,
that
was
the
only
glass
she
had
*NL*
in
which
she
could
see
her
neck
and
arms
,
for
the
small
hanging
*NL*
glass
she
had
fetched
out
of
the
next
room
--
the
room
that
had
been
*NL*
Dinah
's
--
would
show
her
nothing
below
her
little
chin
;
and
that
*NL*
beautiful
bit
of
neck
where
the
roundness
of
her
cheek
melted
into
*NL*
another
roundness
shadowed
by
dark
delicate
curls
.
And
to-day
she
*NL*
thought
more
than
usual
about
her
neck
and
arms
;
for
at
the
dance
this
*NL*
evening
she
was
not
to
wear
any
neckerchief
,
and
she
had
been
busy
*NL*
yesterday
with
her
spotted
pink-and-white
frock
,
that
she
might
make
the
*NL*
sleeves
either
long
or
short
at
will
.
She
was
dressed
now
just
as
she
*NL*
was
to
be
in
the
evening
,
with
a
tucker
made
of
``
real
''
lace
,
which
her
*NL*
aunt
had
lent
her
for
this
unparalleled
occasion
,
but
with
no
ornaments
*NL*
besides
;
she
had
even
taken
out
her
small
round
ear-rings
which
she
wore
*NL*
every
day
.
But
there
was
something
more
to
be
done
,
apparently
,
before
*NL*
she
put
on
her
neckerchief
and
long
sleeves
,
which
she
was
to
wear
in
*NL*
the
day-time
,
for
now
she
unlocked
the
drawer
that
held
her
private
*NL*
treasures
.
It
is
more
than
a
month
since
we
saw
her
unlock
that
drawer
*NL*
before
,
and
now
it
holds
new
treasures
,
so
much
more
precious
than
the
*NL*
old
ones
that
these
are
thrust
into
the
corner
.
Hetty
would
not
care
to
*NL*
put
the
large
coloured
glass
ear-rings
into
her
ears
now
;
for
see
!
she
*NL*
has
got
a
beautiful
pair
of
gold
and
pearls
and
garnet
,
lying
snugly
in
*NL*
a
pretty
little
box
lined
with
white
satin
.
Oh
,
the
delight
of
taking
*NL*
out
that
little
box
and
looking
at
the
ear-rings
!
Do
not
reason
about
*NL*
it
,
my
philosphical
reader
,
and
say
that
Hetty
,
being
very
pretty
,
must
*NL*
have
known
that
it
did
not
signify
whether
she
had
on
any
ornaments
*NL*
or
not
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
to
look
at
ear-rings
which
she
could
not
*NL*
possibly
wear
out
of
her
bedroom
could
hardly
be
a
satisfaction
,
the
*NL*
essence
of
vanity
being
a
reference
to
the
impressions
produced
*NL*
on
others
;
you
will
never
understand
women
's
natures
if
you
are
so
*NL*
excessively
rational
.
Try
rather
to
divest
yourself
of
all
your
rational
*NL*
prejudices
,
as
much
as
if
you
were
studying
the
psychology
of
a
canary
*NL*
bird
,
and
only
watch
the
movements
of
this
pretty
round
creature
as
she
*NL*
turns
her
head
on
one
side
with
an
unconscious
smile
at
the
ear-rings
*NL*
nestled
in
the
little
box
.
Ah
,
you
think
,
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
person
who
has
given
them
to
her
,
and
her
thoughts
are
gone
back
now
to
*NL*
the
moment
when
they
were
put
into
her
hands
.
No
;
else
why
should
she
*NL*
have
cared
to
have
ear-rings
rather
than
anything
else
?
And
I
know
that
*NL*
she
had
longed
for
ear-rings
from
among
all
the
ornaments
she
could
*NL*
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
,
little
ears
!
''
Arthur
had
said
,
pretending
to
pinch
them
one
*NL*
evening
,
as
Hetty
sat
beside
him
on
the
grass
without
her
hat
.
``
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
some
pretty
ear-rings
!
''
she
said
in
a
moment
,
almost
before
she
knew
*NL*
what
she
was
saying
--
the
wish
lay
so
close
to
her
lips
,
it
WOULD
flutter
*NL*
past
them
at
the
slightest
breath
.
And
the
next
day
--
it
was
only
last
*NL*
week
--
Arthur
had
ridden
over
to
Rosseter
on
purpose
to
buy
them
.
That
*NL*
little
wish
so
naively
uttered
seemed
to
him
the
prettiest
bit
of
*NL*
childishness
;
he
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
;
and
he
had
*NL*
wrapped
the
box
up
in
a
great
many
covers
,
that
he
might
see
Hetty
*NL*
unwrapping
it
with
growing
curiosity
,
till
at
last
her
eyes
flashed
back
*NL*
their
new
delight
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
was
not
thinking
most
of
the
giver
when
she
smiled
at
the
*NL*
ear-rings
,
for
now
she
is
taking
them
out
of
the
box
,
not
to
press
them
*NL*
to
her
lips
,
but
to
fasten
them
in
her
ears
--
only
for
one
moment
,
to
*NL*
see
how
pretty
they
look
,
as
she
peeps
at
them
in
the
glass
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
with
first
one
position
of
the
head
and
then
another
,
like
a
*NL*
listening
bird
.
It
is
impossible
to
be
wise
on
the
subject
of
ear-rings
*NL*
as
one
looks
at
her
;
what
should
those
delicate
pearls
and
crystals
be
*NL*
made
for
,
if
not
for
such
ears
?
One
can
not
even
find
fault
with
the
*NL*
tiny
round
hole
which
they
leave
when
they
are
taken
out
;
perhaps
*NL*
water-nixies
,
and
such
lovely
things
without
souls
,
have
these
little
*NL*
round
holes
in
their
ears
by
nature
,
ready
to
hang
jewels
in
.
And
Hetty
*NL*
must
be
one
of
them
:
it
is
too
painful
to
think
that
she
is
a
woman
,
*NL*
with
a
woman
's
destiny
before
her
--
a
woman
spinning
in
young
ignorance
a
*NL*
light
web
of
folly
and
vain
hopes
which
may
one
day
close
round
her
and
*NL*
press
upon
her
,
a
rancorous
poisoned
garment
,
changing
all
at
once
*NL*
her
fluttering
,
trivial
butterfly
sensations
into
a
life
of
deep
human
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
can
not
keep
in
the
ear-rings
long
,
else
she
may
make
her
uncle
*NL*
and
aunt
wait
.
She
puts
them
quickly
into
the
box
again
and
shuts
them
*NL*
up
.
Some
day
she
will
be
able
to
wear
any
ear-rings
she
likes
,
*NL*
and
already
she
lives
in
an
invisible
world
of
brilliant
costumes
,
*NL*
shimmering
gauze
,
soft
satin
,
and
velvet
,
such
as
the
lady
's
maid
at
the
*NL*
Chase
has
shown
her
in
Miss
Lydia
's
wardrobe
.
She
feels
the
bracelets
on
*NL*
her
arms
,
and
treads
on
a
soft
carpet
in
front
of
a
tall
mirror
.
But
*NL*
she
has
one
thing
in
the
drawer
which
she
can
venture
to
wear
to-day
,
*NL*
because
she
can
hang
it
on
the
chain
of
dark-brown
berries
which
she
has
*NL*
been
used
to
wear
on
grand
days
,
with
a
tiny
flat
scent-bottle
at
*NL*
the
end
of
it
tucked
inside
her
frock
;
and
she
must
put
on
her
brown
*NL*
berries
--
her
neck
would
look
so
unfinished
without
it
.
Hetty
was
*NL*
not
quite
as
fond
of
the
locket
as
of
the
ear-rings
,
though
it
was
*NL*
a
handsome
large
locket
,
with
enamelled
flowers
at
the
back
and
a
*NL*
beautiful
gold
border
round
the
glass
,
which
showed
a
light-brown
*NL*
slightly
waving
lock
,
forming
a
background
for
two
little
dark
rings
.
*NL*
She
must
keep
it
under
her
clothes
,
and
no
one
would
see
it
.
But
Hetty
*NL*
had
another
passion
,
only
a
little
less
strong
than
her
love
of
finery
,
*NL*
and
that
other
passion
made
her
like
to
wear
the
locket
even
hidden
in
*NL*
her
bosom
.
She
would
always
have
worn
it
,
if
she
had
dared
to
encounter
*NL*
her
aunt
's
questions
about
a
ribbon
round
her
neck
.
So
now
she
slipped
*NL*
it
on
along
her
chain
of
dark-brown
berries
,
and
snapped
the
chain
round
*NL*
her
neck
.
It
was
not
a
very
long
chain
,
only
allowing
the
locket
to
hang
*NL*
a
little
way
below
the
edge
of
her
frock
.
And
now
she
had
nothing
to
do
*NL*
but
to
put
on
her
long
sleeves
,
her
new
white
gauze
neckerchief
,
and
*NL*
her
straw
hat
trimmed
with
white
to-day
instead
of
the
pink
,
which
*NL*
had
become
rather
faded
under
the
July
sun
.
That
hat
made
the
drop
of
*NL*
bitterness
in
Hetty
's
cup
to-day
,
for
it
was
not
quite
new
--
everybody
*NL*
would
see
that
it
was
a
little
tanned
against
the
white
ribbon
--
and
Mary
*NL*
Burge
,
she
felt
sure
,
would
have
a
new
hat
or
bonnet
on
.
She
looked
for
*NL*
consolation
at
her
fine
white
cotton
stockings
:
they
really
were
very
*NL*
nice
indeed
,
and
she
had
given
almost
all
her
spare
money
for
them
.
*NL*
Hetty
's
dream
of
the
future
could
not
make
her
insensible
to
triumph
in
*NL*
the
present
.
To
be
sure
,
Captain
Donnithorne
loved
her
so
that
he
would
*NL*
never
care
about
looking
at
other
people
,
but
then
those
other
people
*NL*
did
n't
know
how
he
loved
her
,
and
she
was
not
satisfied
to
appear
shabby
*NL*
and
insignificant
in
their
eyes
even
for
a
short
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
was
assembled
in
the
house-place
when
Hetty
went
down
,
*NL*
all
of
course
in
their
Sunday
clothes
;
and
the
bells
had
been
ringing
so
*NL*
this
morning
in
honour
of
the
captain
's
twenty-first
birthday
,
and
the
*NL*
work
had
all
been
got
done
so
early
,
that
Marty
and
Tommy
were
not
quite
*NL*
easy
in
their
minds
until
their
mother
had
assured
them
that
going
*NL*
to
church
was
not
part
of
the
day
's
festivities
.
Mr.
Poyser
had
once
*NL*
suggested
that
the
house
should
be
shut
up
and
left
to
take
care
*NL*
of
itself
;
``
for
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
's
no
danger
of
anybody
's
breaking
*NL*
in
--
everybody
'll
be
at
the
Chase
,
thieves
an
'
all
.
If
we
lock
th
'
house
*NL*
up
,
all
the
men
can
go
:
it
's
a
day
they
wonna
see
twice
i
'
their
lives
.
''
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Poyser
answered
with
great
decision
:
``
I
never
left
the
house
to
*NL*
take
care
of
itself
since
I
was
a
missis
,
and
I
never
will
.
There
's
been
*NL*
ill-looking
tramps
enoo
'
about
the
place
this
last
week
,
to
carry
off
*NL*
every
ham
an
'
every
spoon
we
'n
got
;
and
they
all
collogue
together
,
*NL*
them
tramps
,
as
it
's
a
mercy
they
hanna
come
and
poisoned
the
dogs
and
*NL*
murdered
us
all
in
our
beds
afore
we
knowed
,
some
Friday
night
when
*NL*
we
'n
got
the
money
in
th
'
house
to
pay
the
men
.
And
it
's
like
enough
the
*NL*
tramps
know
where
we
're
going
as
well
as
we
do
oursens
;
for
if
Old
Harry
*NL*
wants
any
work
done
,
you
may
be
sure
he
'll
find
the
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
about
murdering
us
in
our
beds
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
``
I
've
got
a
*NL*
gun
i
'
our
room
,
hanna
I
?
and
thee
`
st
got
ears
as
`
ud
find
it
out
if
a
*NL*
mouse
was
gnawing
the
bacon
.
Howiver
,
if
thee
wouldstna
be
easy
,
Alick
*NL*
can
stay
at
home
i
'
the
forepart
o
'
the
day
,
and
Tim
can
come
back
*NL*
tow
`
rds
five
o'clock
,
and
let
Alick
have
his
turn
.
They
may
let
Growler
*NL*
loose
if
anybody
offers
to
do
mischief
,
and
there
's
Alick
's
dog
too
,
*NL*
ready
enough
to
set
his
tooth
in
a
tramp
if
Alick
gives
him
a
wink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
accepted
this
compromise
,
but
thought
it
advisable
to
bar
*NL*
and
bolt
to
the
utmost
;
and
now
,
at
the
last
moment
before
starting
,
*NL*
Nancy
,
the
dairy-maid
,
was
closing
the
shutters
of
the
house-place
,
*NL*
although
the
window
,
lying
under
the
immediate
observation
of
Alick
and
*NL*
the
dogs
,
might
have
been
supposed
the
least
likely
to
be
selected
for
a
*NL*
burglarious
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
covered
cart
,
without
springs
,
was
standing
ready
to
carry
the
whole
*NL*
family
except
the
men-servants
.
Mr.
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
sat
*NL*
on
the
seat
in
front
,
and
within
there
was
room
for
all
the
women
and
*NL*
children
;
the
fuller
the
cart
the
better
,
because
then
the
jolting
*NL*
would
not
hurt
so
much
,
and
Nancy
's
broad
person
and
thick
arms
were
an
*NL*
excellent
cushion
to
be
pitched
on
.
But
Mr.
Poyser
drove
at
no
more
*NL*
than
a
walking
pace
,
that
there
might
be
as
little
risk
of
jolting
as
*NL*
possible
on
this
warm
day
,
and
there
was
time
to
exchange
greetings
and
*NL*
remarks
with
the
foot-passengers
who
were
going
the
same
way
,
specking
*NL*
the
paths
between
the
green
meadows
and
the
golden
cornfields
with
bits
*NL*
of
movable
bright
colour
--
a
scarlet
waistcoat
to
match
the
poppies
that
*NL*
nodded
a
little
too
thickly
among
the
corn
,
or
a
dark-blue
neckerchief
*NL*
with
ends
flaunting
across
a
brand-new
white
smock-frock
.
All
Broxton
*NL*
and
all
Hayslope
were
to
be
at
the
Chase
,
and
make
merry
there
in
honour
*NL*
of
``
th
'
heir
''
;
and
the
old
men
and
women
,
who
had
never
been
so
far
down
*NL*
this
side
of
the
hill
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
were
being
brought
from
*NL*
Broxton
and
Hayslope
in
one
of
the
farmer
's
waggons
,
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
*NL*
suggestion
.
The
church-bells
had
struck
up
again
now
--
a
last
tune
,
*NL*
before
the
ringers
came
down
the
hill
to
have
their
share
in
the
*NL*
festival
;
and
before
the
bells
had
finished
,
other
music
was
heard
*NL*
approaching
,
so
that
even
Old
Brown
,
the
sober
horse
that
was
drawing
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
's
cart
,
began
to
prick
up
his
ears
.
It
was
the
band
of
the
*NL*
Benefit
Club
,
which
had
mustered
in
all
its
glory
--
that
is
to
say
,
in
*NL*
bright-blue
scarfs
and
blue
favours
,
and
carrying
its
banner
with
*NL*
the
motto
,
``
Let
brotherly
love
continue
,
''
encircling
a
picture
of
a
*NL*
stone-pit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carts
,
of
course
,
were
not
to
enter
the
Chase
.
Every
one
must
get
*NL*
down
at
the
lodges
,
and
the
vehicles
must
be
sent
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
Chase
is
like
a
fair
a
`
ready
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
she
got
*NL*
down
from
the
cart
,
and
saw
the
groups
scattered
under
the
great
oaks
,
*NL*
and
the
boys
running
about
in
the
hot
sunshine
to
survey
the
tall
poles
*NL*
surmounted
by
the
fluttering
garments
that
were
to
be
the
prize
of
the
*NL*
successful
climbers
.
``
I
should
ha
'
thought
there
wasna
so
many
people

the

Mercy

*NL*
might
ha

cooked
the
dinners
i
'
that
open
space
an
'
saved
the
fires
.
I
*NL*
shall
go
to
Mrs.
Best
's
room

sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
bit
,
stop
a
bit
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
There
's
th
'
waggin
coming

wi

th
'
old
folks

it
'll
be
such
a

as
wonna

o'er
again

*NL*
to
see

their
prime

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye

''
said
old
Martin
,
walking
slowly
under
the
shade
of
the
lodge
*NL*
porch
,
from
which
he
could
see
the
aged
party
descend
.
``
I
remember
Jacob
*NL*
Taft
walking
fifty
mile
after
the
Scotch
raybels
,
when
they
turned
back
*NL*
from
Stoniton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
himself
quite
a
youngster
,
with
a
long
life
before
him
,
as
he
*NL*
saw
the
Hayslope
patriarch
,
old
Feyther
Taft
,
descend
from
the
waggon
*NL*
and
walk
towards
him
,
in
his
brown
nightcap
,
and
leaning
on
his
two
*NL*
sticks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mester
Taft
,
''
shouted
old
Martin
,
at
the
utmost
stretch
of
his
*NL*
voice
--
for
though
he
knew
the
old
man
was
stone
deaf
,
he
could
not
omit
*NL*
the
propriety
of
a
greeting
--
``
you
're
hearty
yet
.
You
can
enjoy
yoursen
*NL*
to-day
,
for-all
you
're
ninety
an
'
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sarvant
,
mesters
,
your
sarvant
,
''
said
Feyther
Taft
in
a
treble
*NL*
tone
,
perceiving
that
he
was
in
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aged
group
,
under
care
of
sons
or
daughters
,
themselves
worn
and
*NL*
grey
,
passed
on
along
the
least-winding
carriage-road
towards
the
house
,
*NL*
where
a
special
table
was
prepared
for
them
;
while
the
Poyser
party
*NL*
wisely
struck
across
the
grass
under
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
,
*NL*
but
not
out
of
view
of
the
house-front
,
with
its
sloping
lawn
and
*NL*
flower-beds
,
or
of
the
pretty
striped
marquee
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
,
*NL*
standing
at
right
angles
with
two
larger
marquees
on
each
side
of
the
*NL*
open
green
space
where
the
games
were
to
be
played
.
The
house
would
have
*NL*
been
nothing
but
a
plain
square
mansion
of
Queen
Anne
's
time
,
but
for
*NL*
the
remnant
of
an
old
abbey
to
which
it
was
united
at
one
end
,
in
much
*NL*
the
same
way
as
one
may
sometimes
see
a
new
farmhouse
rising
high
and
*NL*
prim
at
the
end
of
older
and
lower
farm-offices
.
The
fine
old
remnant
*NL*
stood
a
little
backward
and
under
the
shadow
of
tall
beeches
,
but
the
*NL*
sun
was
now
on
the
taller
and
more
advanced
front
,
the
blinds
were
all
*NL*
down
,
and
the
house
seemed
asleep
in
the
hot
midday
.
It
made
Hetty
quite
*NL*
sad
to
look
at
it
:
Arthur
must
be
somewhere
in
the
back
rooms
,
with
the
*NL*
grand
company
,
where
he
could
not
possibly
know
that
she
was
come
,
and
*NL*
she
should
not
see
him
for
a
long
,
long
while
--
not
till
after
dinner
,
*NL*
when
they
said
he
was
to
come
up
and
make
a
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hetty
was
wrong
in
part
of
her
conjecture
.
No
grand
company
was
*NL*
come
except
the
Irwines
,
for
whom
the
carriage
had
been
sent
early
,
*NL*
and
Arthur
was
at
that
moment
not
in
a
back
room
,
but
walking
with
the
*NL*
rector
into
the
broad
stone
cloisters
of
the
old
abbey
,
where
the
long
*NL*
tables
were
laid
for
all
the
cottage
tenants
and
the
farm-servants
.
*NL*
A
very
handsome
young
Briton
he
looked
to-day
,
in
high
spirits
and
a
*NL*
bright-blue
frock-coat
,
the
highest
mode
--
his
arm
no
longer
in
a
sling
.
*NL*
So
open-looking
and
candid
,
too
;
but
candid
people
have
their
secrets
,
*NL*
and
secrets
leave
no
lines
in
young
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
he
said
,
as
they
entered
the
cool
cloisters
,
``
I
think
*NL*
the
cottagers
have
the
best
of
it
:
these
cloisters
make
a
delightful
*NL*
dining-room
on
a
hot
day
.
That
was
capital
advice
of
yours
,
Irwine
,
*NL*
about
the
dinners
--
to
let
them
be
as
orderly
and
comfortable
as
*NL*
possible
,
and
only
for
the
tenants
:
especially
as
I
had
only
a
limited
*NL*
sum
after
all
;
for
though
my
grandfather
talked
of
a
carte
blanche
,
he
*NL*
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
trust
me
,
when
it
came
to
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
you
'll
give
more
pleasure
in
this
quiet
way
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
.
``
In
this
sort
of
thing
people
are
constantly
confounding
*NL*
liberality
with
riot
and
disorder
.
It
sounds
very
grand
to
say
that
so
*NL*
many
sheep
and
oxen
were
roasted
whole
,
and
everybody
ate
who
liked
*NL*
to
come
;
but
in
the
end
it
generally
happens
that
no
one
has
had
an
*NL*
enjoyable
meal
.
If
the
people
get
a
good
dinner
and
a
moderate
quantity
*NL*
of
ale
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
they
'll
be
able
to
enjoy
the
games
*NL*
as
the
day
cools
.
You
ca
n't
hinder
some
of
them
from
getting
too
much
*NL*
towards
evening
,
but
drunkenness
and
darkness
go
better
together
than
*NL*
drunkenness
and
daylight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
there
wo
n't
be
much
of
it
.
I
've
kept
the
Treddleston
*NL*
people
away
by
having
a
feast
for
them
in
the
town
;
and
I
've
got
Casson
*NL*
and
Adam
Bede
and
some
other
good
fellows
to
look
to
the
giving
out
of
*NL*
ale
in
the
booths
,
and
to
take
care
things
do
n't
go
too
far
.
Come
,
let
*NL*
us
go
up
above
now

They
went
up
the
stone
staircase
leading
simply
to
the
long
gallery
*NL*
above
the
cloisters
,
a
gallery
where
all
the
dusty
worthless
old
*NL*
pictures
had
been
banished
for
the
last
three
generations
--
mouldy
*NL*
portraits
of
Queen
Elizabeth
and
her
ladies
,
General
Monk
with
his
eye
*NL*
knocked
out
,
Daniel
very
much
in
the
dark
among
the
lions
,
and
Julius
*NL*
Caesar
on
horseback
,
with
a
high
nose
and
laurel
crown
,
holding
his
*NL*
Commentaries
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
capital
thing
it
is
that
they
saved
this
piece
of
the
old
*NL*
abbey
!
''
said
Arthur
.
``
If
I
'm
ever
master
here
,
I
shall
do
up
the
gallery
*NL*
in
first-rate
style
.
We
've
got
no
room
in
the
house
a
third
as
large
*NL*
as
this
.
That
second
table
is
for
the
farmers
'
wives
and
children
:
Mrs.
*NL*
Best
said
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
the
mothers
and
children
*NL*
to
be
by
themselves
.
I
was
determined
to
have
the
children
,
and
make
a
*NL*
regular
family
thing
of
it
.
I
shall
be
`
the
old
squire
'
to
those
little
*NL*
lads
and
lasses
some
day
,
and
they
'll
tell
their
children
what
a
much
*NL*
finer
young
fellow
I
was
than
my
own
son
.
There
's
a
table
for
the
women
*NL*
and
children
below
as
well
.
But
you
will
see
them
all
--
you
will
come
up
*NL*
with
me
after
dinner
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
I
would
n't
miss
your
maiden
speech
*NL*
to
the
tenantry

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
will
be
something
else
you
'll
like
to
hear
,
''
said
Arthur
.
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
into
the
library
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
while
my
*NL*
grandfather
is
in
the
drawing-room
with
the
ladies
.
Something
that
will
*NL*
surprise
you
,
''
he
continued
,
as
they
sat
down
.
``
My
grandfather
has
come
*NL*
round
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
about
Adam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
should
have
ridden
over
to
tell
you
about
it
,
only
I
was
so
*NL*
busy
.
You
know
I
told
you
I
had
quite
given
up
arguing
the
matter
with
*NL*
him
--
I
thought
it
was
hopeless
--
but
yesterday
morning
he
asked
me
to
*NL*
come
in
here
to
him
before
I
went
out
,
and
astonished
me
by
saying
that
*NL*
he
had
decided
on
all
the
new
arrangements
he
should
make
in
consequence
*NL*
of
old
Satchell
being
obliged
to
lay
by
work
,
and
that
he
intended
to
*NL*
employ
Adam
in
superintending
the
woods
at
a
salary
of
a
guinea
a-week
,
*NL*
and
the
use
of
a
pony
to
be
kept
here
.
I
believe
the
secret
of
it
is
,
*NL*
he
saw
from
the
first
it
would
be
a
profitable
plan
,
but
he
had
some
*NL*
particular
dislike
of
Adam
to
get
over
--
and
besides
,
the
fact
that
I
*NL*
propose
a
thing
is
generally
a
reason
with
him
for
rejecting
it
.
There
's
*NL*
the
most
curious
contradiction
in
my
grandfather
:
I
know
he
means
to
*NL*
leave
me
all
the
money
he
has
saved
,
and
he
is
likely
enough
to
have
cut
*NL*
off
poor
Aunt
Lydia
,
who
has
been
a
slave
to
him
all
her
life
,
with
only
*NL*
five
hundred
a-year
,
for
the
sake
of
giving
me
all
the
more
;
and
yet
I
*NL*
sometimes
think
he
positively
hates
me
because
I
'm
his
heir
.
I
believe
*NL*
if
I
were
to
break
my
neck
,
he
would
feel
it
the
greatest
misfortune
*NL*
that
could
befall
him
,
and
yet
it
seems
a
pleasure
to
him
to
make
my
*NL*
life
a
series
of
petty
annoyances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
boy
,
it
is
not
only
woman
's
love
that
is
-LSB-
two
greek
words
*NL*
omitted
-RSB-
as
old
AEschylus
calls
it
.
There
's
plenty
of
`
unloving
love
'
in
*NL*
the
world
of
a
masculine
kind
.
But
tell
me
about
Adam
.
Has
he
accepted
*NL*
the
post
?
I
do
n't
see
that
it
can
be
much
more
profitable
than
his
*NL*
present
work
,
though
,
to
be
sure
,
it
will
leave
him
a
good
deal
of
time
*NL*
on
his
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
felt
some
doubt
about
it
when
I
spoke
to
him
and
he
seemed
to
*NL*
hesitate
at
first
.
His
objection
was
that
he
thought
he
should
not
be
*NL*
able
to
satisfy
my
grandfather
.
But
I
begged
him
as
a
personal
favour
*NL*
to
me
not
to
let
any
reason
prevent
him
from
accepting
the
place
,
if
he
*NL*
really
liked
the
employment
and
would
not
be
giving
up
anything
that
*NL*
was
more
profitable
to
him
.
And
he
assured
me
he
should
like
it
of
all
*NL*
things
--
it
would
be
a
great
step
forward
for
him
in
business
,
and
it
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
do
what
he
had
long
wished
to
do
,
to
give
up
working
*NL*
for
Burge
.
He
says
he
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
superintend
a
little
*NL*
business
of
his
own
,
which
he
and
Seth
will
carry
on
,
and
will
perhaps
*NL*
be
able
to
enlarge
by
degrees
.
So
he
has
agreed
at
last
,
and
I
have
*NL*
arranged
that
he
shall
dine
with
the
large
tenants
to-day
;
and
I
mean
to
*NL*
announce
the
appointment
to
them
,
and
ask
them
to
drink
Adam
's
health
.
*NL*
It
's
a
little
drama
I
've
got
up
in
honour
of
my
friend
Adam
.
He
's
a
fine
*NL*
fellow
,
and
I
like
the
opportunity
of
letting
people
know
that
I
think
*NL*
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
drama
in
which
friend
Arthur
piques
himself
on
having
a
pretty
part
*NL*
to
play
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
smiling
.
But
when
he
saw
Arthur
colour
,
he
*NL*
went
on
relentingly
,
``
My
part
,
you
know
,
is
always
that
of
the
old
fogy
*NL*
who
sees
nothing
to
admire
in
the
young
folks
.
I
do
n't
like
to
admit
*NL*
that
I
'm
proud
of
my
pupil
when
he
does
graceful
things
.
But
I
must
play
*NL*
the
amiable
old
gentleman
for
once
,
and
second
your
toast
in
honour
of
*NL*
Adam
.
Has
your
grandfather
yielded
on
the
other
point
too
,
and
agreed
to
*NL*
have
a
respectable
man
as
steward
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
said
Arthur
,
rising
from
his
chair
with
an
air
of
impatience
*NL*
and
walking
along
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
``
He
's
got
*NL*
some
project
or
other
about
letting
the
Chase
Farm
and
bargaining
for
*NL*
a
supply
of
milk
and
butter
for
the
house
.
But
I
ask
no
questions
about
*NL*
it
--
it
makes
me
too
angry
.
I
believe
he
means
to
do
all
the
business
*NL*
himself
,
and
have
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
steward
.
It
's
amazing
what
*NL*
energy
he
has
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
go
to
the
ladies
now

''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
rising
too
.
``
I
want

to
tell
my

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Arthur

*NL*
Dinner-Time
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
Adam
heard
that
he
was
to
dine
upstairs
with
the
large
tenants
,
he
*NL*
felt
rather
uncomfortable
at
the
idea
of
being
exalted
in
this
way
above
*NL*
his
mother
and
Seth
,
who
were
to
dine
in
the
cloisters
below
.
But
*NL*
Mr.
Mills
,
the
butler
,
assured
him
that
Captain
Donnithorne
had
given
*NL*
particular
orders
about
it
,
and
would
be
very
angry
if
Adam
was
not
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
nodded
and
went
up
to
Seth
,
who
was
standing
a
few
yards
off
.
*NL*
``
Seth
,
lad
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
captain
has
sent
to
say
I
'm
to
dine

upstairs

he
wishes
it
particular

Mr.
Mills
says
,
so
I
suppose
it
`

*NL*
be
behaving
ill
for
me
not
to
go
.
But
I
do
n't
like
sitting
up
above
thee
*NL*
and
mother
,
as
if
I
was
better
than
my
own
flesh
and
blood
.
Thee

not
*NL*
take
it
unkind
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay

,
''
said
Seth
,
``
thy
honour
's
our
honour
;
and
if
thee
get
`

respect

thee

won

further
I

long

like

because

thy
being
appointed
over
the
woods

it
's
nothing

*NL*
what
's
right

That
's
a
place

common
workman

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

said
Adam
,
``
but
nobody
knows
a
word
about
it

I
have

given

notice
to

leaving
him

I
do

else

be
a

be
wondering

they
'll

enough

guessing

*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
not
the
only
guest
invited
to
come
upstairs
on
other
grounds
*NL*
than
the
amount
he
contributed
to
the
rent-roll
.
There
were
other
people
*NL*
in
the
two
parishes
who
derived
dignity
from
their
functions
rather
than
*NL*
from
their
pocket
,
and
of
these
Bartle
Massey
was
one
.
His
lame
walk
was
*NL*
rather
slower
than
usual
on
this
warm
day
,
so
Adam
lingered
behind
when
*NL*
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
,
that
he
might
walk
up
with
his
old
friend
;
*NL*
for
he
was
a
little
too
shy
to
join
the
Poyser
party
on
this
public
*NL*
occasion
.
Opportunities
of
getting
to
Hetty
's
side
would
be
sure
to
turn
*NL*
up
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
and
Adam
contented
himself
with
that
for
*NL*
he
disliked
any
risk
of
being
``
joked
''
about
Hetty
--
the
big
,
outspoken
,
*NL*
fearless
man
was
very
shy
and
diffident
as
to
his
love-making
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mester
Massey
,
''
said
Adam
,
as
Bartle
came
up
``
I
'm
going

dine

to-day
:

orders

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Bartle
,
pausing
,
with
one
hand
on
his
back
.
``
Then
there

*NL*
something
in

anything

the
old
squire
means

*NL*
``
Why

yes

said
Adam
;
``
I
'll

it
was

*NL*
``

know

Bartle

moving
on

When

upstairs

the

Arthur
had
left
unsettled

as

to

thought

had
the

right

more
nor

''
said
Luke
Britton
,
who
was
not
fond
of
the
critical
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
;
``

's
Mester
Holdsworth

more

nor

else

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
``
suppose
we
say
the
man
wi

the
foulest

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
here

Massey

''
said
Mr.
Craig
,
who
,
being
a
neutral
in
the
*NL*
dispute
,
had
no
interest
but
in
conciliation
;
``
the
schoolmaster
ought
to
*NL*
be
able
to
tell
you
what
's
right

Who
's
to
sit

o

the
table
,
Mr.
*NL*
Massey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
broadest
man
,
''
said
Bartle
;
``
and
then
he
wo
n't
take
up

the
next
broadest

sit
at
bottom

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
happy
mode
of
settling
the
dispute
produced
much
laughter
--
a
*NL*
smaller
joke
would
have
sufficed
for
that
Mr.
Casson
,
however
,
did
not
*NL*
feel
it
compatible
with
his
dignity
and
superior
knowledge
to
join
*NL*
in
the
laugh
,
until
it
turned
out
that
he
was
fixed
on
as
the
second
*NL*
broadest
man
.
Martin
Poyser
the
younger
,
as
the
broadest
,
was
to
be
*NL*
president
,
and
Mr.
Casson
,
as
next
broadest
,
was
to
be
vice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
this
arrangement
,
Adam
,
being
,
of
course
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
table
,
fell
under
the
immediate
observation
of
Mr.
Casson
,
who
,
too
much
*NL*
occupied
with
the
question
of
precedence
,
had
not
hitherto
noticed
his
*NL*
entrance
.
Mr.
Casson
,
we
have
seen
,
considered
Adam
``
rather
lifted
up
*NL*
and
peppery-like
''
:
he
thought
the
gentry
made
more
fuss
about
this
*NL*
young
carpenter
than
was
necessary
;
they
made
no
fuss
about
Mr.
Casson
,
*NL*
although
he
had
been
an
excellent
butler
for
fifteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mr.
Bede
,
you
're
one
o
'
them
as
mounts
hup
`
ards
apace

''
he
said
,
*NL*
when
Adam
sat
down
.
``
You
've
niver
dined
here
before
,
as
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mr.
Casson
,
''
said
Adam
,
in
his
strong
voice
,
that
could
be
heard
*NL*
along
the
table
;
``
I
've
never
dined
here
before
,
but
I
come
by
Captain
*NL*
Donnithorne
's
wish
,
and
I
hope
it
's
not
disagreeable
to
anybody
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
several
voices
at
once
,
``
we
're
glad
ye
're
come

Who
's
*NL*
got
anything
to
say
again

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ye
'll
sing

`
Over
the
hills
and
far
away

after

''
said
Mr.
Chowne
.
``
That
's
a
song
I
'm
uncommon
fond
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peeh
!
''
said
Mr.
Craig
;
``
it
's
not
to
be
named
by
side
o

the
Scotch
*NL*
tunes
.
I
've
never
cared
about
singing
myself
;
I
've
had
something
better
*NL*
to
do
.
A
man
that
's
got
the
names

natur
o

plants
in
's
head
isna
*NL*
likely
to
keep

hollow
place

hold
tunes
in
.
But
a
second
cousin
o
'
*NL*
mine
,
a
drovier
,
was
a
rare
hand
at
remembering
the
Scotch
tunes

He
'd
*NL*
got
nothing
else
to
think
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Scotch
tunes
!
''
said
Bartle
Massey
,
contemptuously
;
``
I
've
heard
*NL*
enough
o
'
the
Scotch
tunes
to
last
me
while
I
live
.
They
're
fit
for
*NL*
nothing
but
to
frighten
the
birds
with
--
that
's
to
say
,
the
English
*NL*
birds
,
for
the
Scotch
birds
may
sing
Scotch
for
what
I
know
.
Give
the
*NL*
lads
a
bagpipe
instead
of
a
rattle
,
and
I
'll
answer
for
it
the
corn

*NL*
be
safe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
folks
as
find
a
pleasure
in
undervallying
what
they
know
*NL*
but
little
about
,
''
said
Mr.
Craig
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
Scotch
tunes
are
just
like
a
scolding
,
nagging
woman
,
''
Bartle
*NL*
went
on
,
without
deigning
to
notice
Mr.
Craig
's
remark
.
``
They
go
on
with
*NL*
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
,
and
never
come
to
a
reasonable
end
.
*NL*
Anybody
`
ud
think
the
Scotch
tunes
had
always
been
asking
a
question
of
*NL*
somebody
as
deaf
as
old
Taft
,
and
had
never
got
an
answer
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
minded
the
less
about
sitting
by
Mr.
Casson
,
because
this
position
*NL*
enabled
him
to
see
Hetty
,
who
was
not
far
off
him
at
the
next
table
.
*NL*
Hetty
,
however
,
had
not
even
noticed
his
presence
yet
,
for
she
was
*NL*
giving
angry
attention
to
Totty
,
who
insisted
on
drawing
up
her
feet
on
*NL*
to
the
bench
in
antique
fashion
,
and
thereby
threatened
to
make
dusty
*NL*
marks
on
Hetty
's
pink-and-white
frock
.
No
sooner
were
the
little
fat
*NL*
legs
pushed
down
than
up
they
came
again
,
for
Totty
's
eyes
were
too
busy
*NL*
in
staring
at
the
large
dishes
to
see
where
the
plum
pudding
was
for
*NL*
her
to
retain
any
consciousness
of
her
legs
.
Hetty
got
quite
out
of
*NL*
patience
,
and
at
last
,
with
a
frown
and
pout
,
and
gathering
tears
,
she
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
dear
,
Aunt
,
I
wish
you
'd
speak
to
Totty
;
she
keeps
putting
her
*NL*
legs
up
so
,
and
messing
my
frock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
the
child
?
She
can
niver
please
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
mother
.
``
Let
her
come
by
the
side
o
'
me
,
then
.
I
can
put
up
wi
'
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
looking
at
Hetty
,
and
saw
the
frown
,
and
pout
,
and
the
dark
*NL*
eyes
seeming
to
grow
larger
with
pettish
half-gathered
tears
.
Quiet
Mary
*NL*
Burge
,
who
sat
near
enough
to
see
that
Hetty
was
cross
and
that
Adam
's
*NL*
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
,
thought
that
so
sensible
a
man
as
Adam
must
be
*NL*
reflecting
on
the
small
value
of
beauty
in
a
woman
whose
temper
was
bad
.
*NL*
Mary
was
a
good
girl
,
not
given
to
indulge
in
evil
feelings
,
but
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
that
,
since
Hetty
had
a
bad
temper
,
it
was
better
Adam
*NL*
should
know
it
.
And
it
was
quite
true
that
if
Hetty
had
been
plain
,
she
*NL*
would
have
looked
very
ugly
and
unamiable
at
that
moment
,
and
no
one
's
*NL*
moral
judgment
upon
her
would
have
been
in
the
least
beguiled
.
But
*NL*
really
there
was
something
quite
charming
in
her
pettishness
:
it
looked
*NL*
so
much
more
like
innocent
distress
than
ill
humour
;
and
the
severe
Adam
*NL*
felt
no
movement
of
disapprobation
;
he
only
felt
a
sort
of
amused
pity
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
seen
a
kitten
setting
up
its
back
,
or
a
little
bird
with
*NL*
its
feathers
ruffled
.
He
could
not
gather
what
was
vexing
her
,
but
it
*NL*
was
impossible
to
him
to
feel
otherwise
than
that
she
was
the
prettiest
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
,
and
that
if
he
could
have
his
way
,
nothing
should
*NL*
ever
vex
her
any
more
.
And
presently
,
when
Totty
was
gone
,
she
caught
*NL*
his
eye
,
and
her
face
broke
into
one
of
its
brightest
smiles
,
as
she
*NL*
nodded
to
him
.
It
was
a
bit
of
flirtation
--
she
knew
Mary
Burge
was
*NL*
looking
at
them
.
But
the
smile
was
like
wine
to
Adam
.

Chapter
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Health-Drinking
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
the
dinner
was
over
,
and
the
first
draughts
from
the
great
cask
of
*NL*
birthday
ale
were
brought
up
,
room
was
made
for
the
broad
Mr.
Poyser
at
*NL*
the
side
of
the
table
,
and
two
chairs
were
placed
at
the
head
.
It
had
*NL*
been
settled
very
definitely
what
Mr.
Poyser
was
to
do
when
the
young
*NL*
squire
should
appear
,
and
for
the
last
five
minutes
he
had
been
in
a
*NL*
state
of
abstraction
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
picture
opposite
,
*NL*
and
his
hands
busy
with
the
loose
cash
and
other
articles
in
his
*NL*
breeches
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
squire
entered
,
with
Mr.
Irwine
by
his
side
,
every
one
*NL*
stood
up
,
and
this
moment
of
homage
was
very
agreeable
to
Arthur
.
He
*NL*
liked
to
feel
his
own
importance
,
and
besides
that
,
he
cared
a
great
*NL*
deal
for
the
good-will
of
these
people
:
he
was
fond
of
thinking
that
*NL*
they
had
a
hearty
,
special
regard
for
him
.
The
pleasure
he
felt
was
in
*NL*
his
face
as
he
said
,
``
My
grandfather
and
I
hope
all
our
friends
here
*NL*
have
enjoyed
their
dinner
,
and
find
my
birthday
ale
good
.
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
and
I
are
come
to
taste
it
with
you
,
and
I
am
sure
we
shall
all
like
*NL*
anything
the
better
that
the
rector
shares
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
were
now
turned
on
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
,
with
his
hands
still
busy
*NL*
in
his
pockets
,
began
with
the
deliberateness
of
a
slow-striking
clock
.
*NL*
``
Captain
,
my
neighbours
have
put
it
upo
'
me
to
speak
for
'em
to-day
,
for
*NL*
where
folks
think
pretty
much
alike
,
one
spokesman
's
as
good
as
a
score
.
*NL*
And
though
we
've
mayhappen
got
contrairy
ways
o

thinking
about
a
many
*NL*
things
--
one
man
lays
down
his
land
one
way

another

an

I
'll
*NL*
not
take
it
upon
me
to
speak
to
no
man

,
but
my
own
--
this
I
'll
*NL*
say
,
as
we
're
all
o
'
one
mind
about
our
young
squire

We
've
pretty
nigh
*NL*
all
on

known
you
when

a
little
un

an

we
've
niver
known
*NL*
anything
on
you
but
what
was
good

honorable
.
You
speak
fair

'
*NL*
y
'
act
fair
,
an
'
we
're
joyful
when
we
look
forrard
to
your
being
our
*NL*
landlord
,
for
we
b
`
lieve
you
mean
to
do
right
by
everybody
,
an
'
`
ull
*NL*
make
no
man
's
bread
bitter
to
him
if
you
can
help
it
.
That
's
what
I
*NL*
mean
,
an
'
that
's
what
we
all
mean
;
and
when
a
man
's
said
what
he
means
,
*NL*
he
'd
better
stop
,
for
th
'
ale
`
ull
be
none
the
better
for
stannin
'
.
An
'
*NL*
I
'll
not
say
how
we
like
th
'
ale
yet
,
for
we
couldna
well
taste
it
till
*NL*
we
'd
drunk
your
health
in
it
;
but
the
dinner
was
good
,
an
'
if
there
's
*NL*
anybody
hasna
enjoyed
it
,
it
must
be
the
fault
of
his
own
inside
.
An

as
*NL*
for
the
rector
's
company
,
it
's
well
known
as
that
's
welcome
t

he

folks
,
an

our
children
grown
to
men
an

women
an

Your
*NL*
Honour

I
've
no
more
to
say
as
concerns
the
present
time
,
*NL*
an

so
we
'll
drink
our
young

's
health

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
a
glorious
shouting
,
a
rapping
,
a
jingling
,
a
clattering
,
and
a
*NL*
shouting
,
with
plentiful
da
capo
,
pleasanter
than
a
strain
of
sublimest
*NL*
music
in
the
ears
that
receive
such
a
tribute
for
the
first
time
.
Arthur
*NL*
had
felt
a
twinge
of
conscience
during
Mr.
Poyser
's
speech
,
but
it
was
*NL*
too
feeble
to
nullify
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
being
praised
.
Did
he
not
*NL*
deserve
what
was
said
of
him
on
the
whole
?
If
there
was
something
in
*NL*
his
conduct
that
Poyser
would
n't
have
liked
if
he
had
known
it
,
why
,
*NL*
no
man
's
conduct
will
bear
too
close
an
inspection
;
and
Poyser
was
not
*NL*
likely
to
know
it
;
and
,
after
all
,
what
had
he
done
?
Gone
a
little
too
*NL*
far
,
perhaps
,
in
flirtation
,
but
another
man
in
his
place
would
have
*NL*
acted
much
worse
;
and
no
harm
would
come
--
no
harm
should
come
,
for
the
*NL*
next
time
he
was
alone
with
Hetty
,
he
would
explain
to
her
that
she
must
*NL*
not
think
seriously
of
him
or
of
what
had
passed
.
It
was
necessary
*NL*
to
Arthur
,
you
perceive
,
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
.
Uncomfortable
*NL*
thoughts
must
be
got
rid
of
by
good
intentions
for
the
future
,
which
can
*NL*
be
formed
so
rapidly
that
he
had
time
to
be
uncomfortable
and
to
become
*NL*
easy
again
before
Mr.
Poyser
's
slow
speech
was
finished
,
and
when
it
was
*NL*
time
for
him
to
speak
he
was
quite
light-hearted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
all
,
my
good
friends
and
neighbours
,
''
Arthur
said
,
``
for
the
*NL*
good
opinion
of
me
,
and
the
kind
feelings
towards
me
which
Mr.
Poyser
*NL*
has
been
expressing
on
your
behalf
and
on
his
own
,
and
it
will
always
be
*NL*
my
heartiest
wish
to
deserve
them
.
In
the
course
of
things
we
may
expect
*NL*
that
,
if
I
live
,
I
shall
one
day
or
other
be
your
landlord
;
indeed
,
it
*NL*
is
on
the
ground
of
that
expectation
that
my
grandfather
has
wished
me
*NL*
to
celebrate
this
day
and
to
come
among
you
now
;
and
I
look
forward
to
*NL*
this
position
,
not
merely
as
one
of
power
and
pleasure
for
myself
,
but
*NL*
as
a
means
of
benefiting
my
neighbours
.
It
hardly
becomes
so
young
a
man
*NL*
as
I
am
to
talk
much
about
farming
to
you
,
who
are
most
of
you
so
much
*NL*
older
,
and
are
men
of
experience
;
still
,
I
have
interested
myself
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
such
matters
,
and
learned
as
much
about
them
as
my
opportunities
*NL*
have
allowed
;
and
when
the
course
of
events
shall
place
the
estate
in
*NL*
my
hands
,
it
will
be
my
first
desire
to
afford
my
tenants
all
the
*NL*
encouragement
a
landlord
can
give
them
,
in
improving
their
land
and
*NL*
trying
to
bring
about
a
better
practice
of
husbandry
.
It
will
be
my
wish
*NL*
to
be
looked
on
by
all
my
deserving
tenants
as
their
best
friend
,
and
*NL*
nothing
would
make
me
so
happy
as
to
be
able
to
respect
every
man
on
*NL*
the
estate
,
and
to
be
respected
by
him
in
return
.
It
is
not
my
place
*NL*
at
present
to
enter
into
particulars
;
I
only
meet
your
good
hopes
*NL*
concerning
me
by
telling
you
that
my
own
hopes
correspond
to
them
--
that
*NL*
what
you
expect
from
me
I
desire
to
fulfil
;
and
I
am
quite
of
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
's
opinion
,
that
when
a
man
has
said
what
he
means
,
he
had
better
*NL*
stop
.
But
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
having
my
own
health
drunk
by
you
would
*NL*
not
be
perfect
if
we
did
not
drink
the
health
of
my
grandfather
,
who
has
*NL*
filled
the
place
of
both
parents
to
me
.
I
will
say
no
more
,
until
you
*NL*
have
joined
me
in
drinking
his
health
on
a
day
when
he
has
wished
me
to
*NL*
appear
among
you
as
the
future
representative
of
his
name
and
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
there
was
no
one
present
except
Mr.
Irwine
who
thoroughly
*NL*
understood
and
approved
Arthur
's
graceful
mode
of
proposing
his
*NL*
grandfather
's
health
.
The
farmers
thought
the
young
squire
knew
well
*NL*
enough
that
they
hated
the
old
squire
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
``
he
'd
*NL*
better
not
ha
'
stirred
a
kettle
o
'
sour
broth
.
''
The
bucolic
mind
does
*NL*
not
readily
apprehend
the
refinements
of
good
taste
.
But
the
toast
could
*NL*
not
be
rejected
and
when
it
had
been
drunk
,
Arthur
said
,
``
I
thank
you
,
*NL*
both
for
my
grandfather
and
myself
;
and
now
there
is
one
more
thing
I
*NL*
wish
to
tell
you
,
that
you
may
share
my
pleasure
about
it
,
as
I
hope
*NL*
and
believe
you
will
.
I
think
there
can
be
no
man
here
who
has
not
a
*NL*
respect
,
and
some
of
you
,
I
am
sure
,
have
a
very
high
regard
,
for
my
*NL*
friend
Adam
Bede
.
It
is
well
known
to
every
one
in
this
neighbourhood
*NL*
that
there
is
no
man
whose
word
can
be
more
depended
on
than
his
;
that
*NL*
whatever
he
undertakes
to
do
,
he
does
well
,
and
is
as
careful
for
the
*NL*
interests
of
those
who
employ
him
as
for
his
own
.
I
'm
proud
to
say
that
*NL*
I
was
very
fond
of
Adam
when
I
was
a
little
boy
,
and
I
have
never
lost
*NL*
my
old
feeling
for
him
--
I
think
that
shows
that
I
know
a
good
fellow
*NL*
when
I
find
him
.
It
has
long
been
my
wish
that
he
should
have
the
*NL*
management
of
the
woods
on
the
estate
,
which
happen
to
be
very
valuable
,
*NL*
not
only
because
I
think
so
highly
of
his
character
,
but
because
he
has
*NL*
the
knowledge
and
the
skill
which
fit
him
for
the
place
.
And
I
am
happy
*NL*
to
tell
you
that
it
is
my
grandfather
's
wish
too
,
and
it
is
now
settled
*NL*
that
Adam
shall
manage
the
woods
--
a
change
which
I
am
sure
will
be
very
*NL*
much
for
the
advantage
of
the
estate
;
and
I
hope
you
will
by
and
by
join
*NL*
me
in
drinking
his
health
,
and
in
wishing
him
all
the
prosperity
in
life
*NL*
that
he
deserves
.
But
there
is
a
still
older
friend
of
mine
than
Adam
*NL*
Bede
present
,
and
I
need
not
tell
you
that
it
is
Mr.
Irwine
.
I
'm
sure
*NL*
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
must
drink
no
other
person
's
health
until
*NL*
we
have
drunk
his
.
I
know
you
have
all
reason
to
love
him
,
but
no
one
of
*NL*
his
parishioners
has
so
much
reason
as
I.
Come
,
charge
your
glasses
,
and
*NL*
let
us
drink
to
our
excellent
rector
--
three
times
three
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
toast
was
drunk
with
all
the
enthusiasm
that
was
wanting
to
the
*NL*
last
,
and
it
certainly
was
the
most
picturesque
moment
in
the
scene
when
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
got
up
to
speak
,
and
all
the
faces
in
the
room
were
turned
*NL*
towards
him
.
The
superior
refinement
of
his
face
was
much
more
striking
*NL*
than
that
of
Arthur
's
when
seen
in
comparison
with
the
people
round
*NL*
them
.
Arthur
's
was
a
much
commoner
British
face
,
and
the
splendour
of
*NL*
his
new-fashioned
clothes
was
more
akin
to
the
young
farmer
's
taste
*NL*
in
costume
than
Mr.
Irwine
's
powder
and
the
well-brushed
but
well-worn
*NL*
black
,
which
seemed
to
be
his
chosen
suit
for
great
occasions
;
for
he
*NL*
had
the
mysterious
secret
of
never
wearing
a
new-looking
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
the
first
time
,
by
a
great
many
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
I
have
*NL*
had
to
thank
my
parishioners
for
giving
me
tokens
of
their
goodwill
,
but
*NL*
neighbourly
kindness
is
among
those
things
that
are
the
more
precious
*NL*
the
older
they
get
.
Indeed
,
our
pleasant
meeting
to-day
is
a
proof
that
*NL*
when
what
is
good
comes
of
age
and
is
likely
to
live
,
there
is
reason
*NL*
for
rejoicing
,
and
the
relation
between
us
as
clergyman
and
parishioners
*NL*
came
of
age
two
years
ago
,
for
it
is
three-and-twenty
years
since
I
*NL*
first
came
among
you
,
and
I
see
some
tall
fine-looking
young
men
here
,
*NL*
as
well
as
some
blooming
young
women
,
that
were
far
from
looking
as
*NL*
pleasantly
at
me
when
I
christened
them
as
I
am
happy
to
see
them
*NL*
looking
now
.
But
I
'm
sure
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
say
that
among
all
*NL*
those
young
men
,
the
one
in
whom
I
have
the
strongest
interest
is
my
*NL*
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
for
whom
you
have
just
expressed
your
*NL*
regard
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
being
his
tutor
for
several
years
,
and
*NL*
have
naturally
had
opportunities
of
knowing
him
intimately
which
can
not
*NL*
have
occurred
to
any
one
else
who
is
present
;
and
I
have
some
pride
as
*NL*
well
as
pleasure
in
assuring
you
that
I
share
your
high
hopes
concerning
*NL*
him
,
and
your
confidence
in
his
possession
of
those
qualities
which
will
*NL*
make
him
an
excellent
landlord
when
the
time
shall
come
for
him
to
take
*NL*
that
important
position
among
you
.
We
feel
alike
on
most
matters
on
*NL*
which
a
man
who
is
getting
towards
fifty
can
feel
in
common
with
a
young
*NL*
man
of
one-and-twenty
,
and
he
has
just
been
expressing
a
feeling
which
*NL*
I
share
very
heartily
,
and
I
would
not
willingly
omit
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
saying
so
.
That
feeling
is
his
value
and
respect
for
Adam
Bede
.
People
*NL*
in
a
high
station
are
of
course
more
thought
of
and
talked
about
and
*NL*
have
their
virtues
more
praised
,
than
those
whose
lives
are
passed
in
*NL*
humble
everyday
work
;
but
every
sensible
man
knows
how
necessary
that
*NL*
humble
everyday
work
is
,
and
how
important
it
is
to
us
that
it
should
be
*NL*
done
well
.
And
I
agree
with
my
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
in
feeling
*NL*
that
when
a
man
whose
duty
lies
in
that
sort
of
work
shows
a
character
*NL*
which
would
make
him
an
example
in
any
station
,
his
merit
should
be
*NL*
acknowledged
.
He
is
one
of
those
to
whom
honour
is
due
,
and
his
friends
*NL*
should
delight
to
honour
him
.
I
know
Adam
Bede
well
--
I
know
what
he
is
*NL*
as
a
workman
,
and
what
he
has
been
as
a
son
and
brother
--
and
I
am
saying
*NL*
the
simplest
truth
when
I
say
that
I
respect
him
as
much
as
I
respect
*NL*
any
man
living
.
But
I
am
not
speaking
to
you
about
a
stranger
;
some
of
*NL*
you
are
his
intimate
friends
,
and
I
believe
there
is
not
one
here
who
*NL*
does
not
know
enough
of
him
to
join
heartily
in
drinking
his
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Irwine
paused
,
Arthur
jumped
up
and
,
filling
his
glass
,
said
,
``
A
*NL*
bumper
to
Adam
Bede
,
and
may
he
live
to
have
sons
as
faithful
and
clever
*NL*
as
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
hearer
,
not
even
Bartle
Massey
,
was
so
delighted
with
this
toast
as
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
Tough
work
''
as
his
first
speech
had
been
,
he
would
have
*NL*
started
up
to
make
another
if
he
had
not
known
the
extreme
irregularity
*NL*
of
such
a
course
.
As
it
was
,
he
found
an
outlet
for
his
feeling
in
*NL*
drinking
his
ale
unusually
fast
,
and
setting
down
his
glass
with
a
swing
*NL*
of
his
arm
and
a
determined
rap
.
If
Jonathan
Burge
and
a
few
others
*NL*
felt
less
comfortable
on
the
occasion
,
they
tried
their
best
to
look
*NL*
contented
,
and
so
the
toast
was
drunk
with
a
goodwill
apparently
*NL*
unanimous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
rather
paler
than
usual
when
he
got
up
to
thank
his
friends
.
He
*NL*
was
a
good
deal
moved
by
this
public
tribute
--
very
naturally
,
for
he
was
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
all
his
little
world
,
and
it
was
uniting
to
do
him
*NL*
honour
.
But
he
felt
no
shyness
about
speaking
,
not
being
troubled
*NL*
with
small
vanity
or
lack
of
words
;
he
looked
neither
awkward
nor
*NL*
embarrassed
,
but
stood
in
his
usual
firm
upright
attitude
,
with
his
head
*NL*
thrown
a
little
backward
and
his
hands
perfectly
still
,
in
that
rough
*NL*
dignity
which
is
peculiar
to
intelligent
,
honest
,
well-built
workmen
,
*NL*
who
are
never
wondering
what
is
their
business
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
taken
by
surprise
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
did
n't
expect
anything
o
'
*NL*
this
sort
,
for
it
's
a
good
deal
more
than
my
wages
.
But
I
've
the
more
*NL*
reason
to
be
grateful
to
you
,
Captain
,
and
to
you
,
Mr.
Irwine
,
and
to
*NL*
all
my
friends
here
,
who
've
drunk
my
health
and
wished
me
well
.
It
`
ud
*NL*
be
nonsense
for
me
to
be
saying
,
I
do
n't
at
all
deserve
th
'
opinion
you
*NL*
have
of
me
;
that
`
ud
be
poor
thanks
to
you
,
to
say
that
you
've
known
me
*NL*
all
these
years
and
yet
have
n't
sense
enough
to
find
out
a
great
deal
o
'
*NL*
the
truth
about
me
.
You
think
,
if
I
undertake
to
do
a
bit
o
'
work
,
I
'll
*NL*
do
it
well
,
be
my
pay
big
or
little
--
and
that
's
true
.
I
'd
be
ashamed
*NL*
to
stand
before
you
here
if
it
wasna
true
.
But
it
seems
to
me
that
's
*NL*
a
man
's
plain
duty
,
and
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
,
and
it
's
pretty
*NL*
clear
to
me
as
I
've
never
done
more
than
my
duty
;
for
let
us
do
what
we
*NL*
will
,
it
's
only
making
use
o
'
the
sperrit
and
the
powers
that
ha
'
been
*NL*
given
to
us
.
And
so
this
kindness
o
'
yours
,
I
'm
sure
,
is
no
debt
you
owe
*NL*
me
,
but
a
free
gift
,
and
as
such
I
accept
it
and
am
thankful
.
And
as
to
*NL*
this
new
employment
I
've
taken
in
hand
,
I
'll
only
say
that
I
took
it
*NL*
at
Captain
Donnithorne
's
desire
,
and
that
I
'll
try
to
fulfil
his
*NL*
expectations
.
I
'd
wish
for
no
better
lot
than
to
work
under
him
,
and
*NL*
to
know
that
while
I
was
getting
my
own
bread
I
was
taking
care
of
his
*NL*
int
`
rests
.
For
I
believe
he
's
one
o
those
gentlemen
as
wishes
to
do
the
*NL*
right
thing
,
and
to
leave
the
world
a
bit
better
than
he
found
it
,
which
*NL*
it
's
my
belief
every
man
may
do
,
whether
he
's
gentle
or
simple
,
whether
*NL*
he
sets
a
good
bit
o
'
work
going
and
finds
the
money
,
or
whether
he
does
*NL*
the
work
with
his
own
hands
.
There
's
no
occasion
for
me
to
say
any
more
*NL*
about
what
I
feel
towards
him
:
I
hope
to
show
it
through
the
rest
o
'
my
*NL*
life
in
my
actions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
various
opinions
about
Adam
's
speech
:
some
of
the
women
*NL*
whispered
that
he
did
n't
show
himself
thankful
enough
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
speak
as
proud
as
could
be
;
but
most
of
the
men
were
of
opinion
that
*NL*
nobody
could
speak
more
straightfor
`
ard
,
and
that
Adam
was
as
fine
a
*NL*
chap
as
need
to
be
.
While
such
observations
were
being
buzzed
about
,
*NL*
mingled
with
wonderings
as
to
what
the
old
squire
meant
to
do
for
a
*NL*
bailiff
,
and
whether
he
was
going
to
have
a
steward
,
the
two
gentlemen
*NL*
had
risen
,
and
were
walking
round
to
the
table
where
the
wives
and
*NL*
children
sat
.
There
was
none
of
the
strong
ale
here
,
of
course
,
but
*NL*
wine
and
dessert
--
sparkling
gooseberry
for
the
young
ones
,
and
some
good

Mrs.
Poyser
was
at
the
head
of
this
table
,
and
*NL*
Totty
was
now
seated
in
her
lap
,
bending
her
small
nose
deep
down
into
a
*NL*
wine-glass
in
search
of
the
nuts
floating
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Poyser
?
''
said
Arthur
.
``
Were
n't
you
pleased
to
hear
*NL*
your
husband
make
such
a
good
speech
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
the
men
are
mostly
so
tongue-tied
--
you
're
forced
partly
to
*NL*
guess
what
they
mean
,
as
you
do
wi
'
the
dumb
creaturs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
think
you
could
have
made
it
better
for
him
?
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
when
I
want
to
say
anything
,
I
can
mostly
find
words
to
say
*NL*
it
in
,
thank
God
.
Not
as
I
'm
a-finding
faut
wi
'
my
husband
,
for
if
he
's
*NL*
a
man
o
'
few
words
,
what
he
says
he
'll
stand
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
never
saw
a
prettier
party
than
this
,
''
Arthur
said
,
looking
*NL*
round
at
the
apple-cheeked
children
.
``
My
aunt
and
the
Miss
Irwines
will
*NL*
come
up
and
see
you
presently
.
They
were
afraid
of
the
noise
of
the
*NL*
toasts
,
but
it
would
be
a
shame
for
them
not
to
see
you
at
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
,
speaking
to
the
mothers
and
patting
the
children
,
while
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
satisfied
himself
with
standing
still
and
nodding
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
that
no
one
's
attention
might
be
disturbed
from
the
young
*NL*
squire
,
the
hero
of
the
day
.
Arthur
did
not
venture
to
stop
near
Hetty
,
*NL*
but
merely
bowed
to
her
as
he
passed
along
the
opposite
side
.
The
*NL*
foolish
child
felt
her
heart
swelling
with
discontent
;
for
what
woman
*NL*
was
ever
satisfied
with
apparent
neglect
,
even
when
she
knows
it
to
be
*NL*
the
mask
of
love
?
Hetty
thought
this
was
going
to
be
the
most
miserable
*NL*
day
she
had
had
for
a
long
while
,
a
moment
of
chill
daylight
and
reality
*NL*
came
across
her
dream
:
Arthur
,
who
had
seemed
so
near
to
her
only
a
few
*NL*
hours
before
,
was
separated
from
her
,
as
the
hero
of
a
great
procession
*NL*
is
separated
from
a
small
outsider
in
the
crowd
.

The
Games
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
great
dance
was
not
to
begin
until
eight
o'clock
,
but
for
any
lads
*NL*
and
lasses
who
liked
to
dance
on
the
shady
grass
before
then
,
there
was
*NL*
music
always
at
hand
--
for
was
not
the
band
of
the
Benefit
Club
capable
*NL*
of
playing
excellent
jigs
,
reels
,
and
hornpipes
?
And
,
besides
this
,
*NL*
there
was
a
grand
band
hired
from
Rosseter
,
who
,
with
their
wonderful
*NL*
wind-instruments
and
puffed-out
cheeks
,
were
themselves
a
delightful
*NL*
show
to
the
small
boys
and
girls
.
To
say
nothing
of
Joshua
Rann
's
*NL*
fiddle
,
which
,
by
an
act
of
generous
forethought
,
he
had
provided
*NL*
himself
with
,
in
case
any
one
should
be
of
sufficiently
pure
taste
to
*NL*
prefer
dancing
to
a
solo
on
that
instrument
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
,
when
the
sun
had
moved
off
the
great
open
space
in
front
of
*NL*
the
house
,
the
games
began
.
There
were
,
of
course
,
well-soaped
poles
*NL*
to
be
climbed
by
the
boys
and
youths
,
races
to
be
run
by
the
old
women
,
*NL*
races
to
be
run
in
sacks
,
heavy
weights
to
be
lifted
by
the
strong
men
,
*NL*
and
a
long
list
of
challenges
to
such
ambitious
attempts
as
that
*NL*
of
walking
as
many
yards
possible
on
one
leg
--
feats
in
which
it
was
*NL*
generally
remarked
that
Wiry
Ben
,
being
``
the
lissom
`
st
,
springest
fellow
*NL*
i
'
the
country
,
''
was
sure
to
be
pre-eminent
.
To
crown
all
,
there
was
to
*NL*
be
a
donkey-race
--
that
sublimest
of
all
races
,
conducted
on
the
grand
*NL*
socialistic
idea
of
everybody
encouraging
everybody
else
's
donkey
,
and
*NL*
the
sorriest
donkey
winning
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
soon
after
four
o'clock
,
splendid
old
Mrs.
Irwine
,
in
her
damask
*NL*
satin
and
jewels
and
black
lace
,
was
led
out
by
Arthur
,
followed
by
the
*NL*
whole
family
party
,
to
her
raised
seat
under
the
striped
marquee
,
where
*NL*
she
was
to
give
out
the
prizes
to
the
victors
.
Staid
,
formal
Miss
Lydia
*NL*
had
requested
to
resign
that
queenly
office
to
the
royal
old
lady
,
and
*NL*
Arthur
was
pleased
with
this
opportunity
of
gratifying
his
godmother
's
*NL*
taste
for
stateliness
.
Old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
the
delicately
clean
,
*NL*
finely
scented
,
withered
old
man
,
led
out
Miss
Irwine
,
with
his
air
of
*NL*
punctilious
,
acid
politeness
;
Mr.
Gawaine
brought
Miss
Lydia
,
looking
*NL*
neutral
and
stiff
in
an
elegant
peach-blossom
silk
;
and
Mr.
Irwine
came
*NL*
last
with
his
pale
sister
Anne
.
No
other
friend
of
the
family
,
besides
*NL*
Mr.
Gawaine
,
was
invited
to-day
;
there
was
to
be
a
grand
dinner
for
*NL*
the
neighbouring
gentry
on
the
morrow
,
but
to-day
all
the
forces
were
*NL*
required
for
the
entertainment
of
the
tenants
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sunk
fence
in
front
of
the
marquee
,
dividing
the
lawn
from
*NL*
the
park
,
but
a
temporary
bridge
had
been
made
for
the
passage
of
the
*NL*
victors
,
and
the
groups
of
people
standing
,
or
seated
here
and
there
*NL*
on
benches
,
stretched
on
each
side
of
the
open
space
from
the
white
*NL*
marquees
up
to
the
sunk
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
it
's
a
pretty
sight
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
in
her
deep
*NL*
voice
,
when
she
was
seated
,
and
looked
round
on
the
bright
scene
with
*NL*
its
dark-green
background
;
``
and
it
's
the
last
fete-day
I
'm
likely
to
*NL*
see

unless
you
make
haste
and
get
married
,
Arthur
.
But
take
care

*NL*
get
a
charming
bride

I
would
rather
die
without
seeing
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
so
terribly
fastidious

said
Arthur
,
``
I

you

my
choice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I

forgive
you

she

I

with
amiability

which
is
always
the
excuse
people
are
making
for
the
*NL*
existence

plain
people

And
she
must
not
be
silly

will
never

Who
is
that
tall
young
man

Dauphin

with
the
mild
face

There

standing
*NL*
without

taking
such
care
of
that
tall
old
woman
by
the
side

of
him

Mr.

very
good

Poor
Seth
*NL*
has
looked
rather
down-hearted
of
late
;
I
thought
it
was
because
of
his
*NL*
father
's
dying
in
that
sad
way
,
but
Joshua
Rann
tells
me
he
wanted
to
*NL*
marry
that
sweet
little
Methodist
preacher

was
here
about
a
month
*NL*
ago

I

refused

*NL*

there
are
no

people
here

grown
up

about

*NL*
``

old
Mr.

was

holding
a
double
glass
up
to
his

is
nothing

a
pale
blurred

spot
to
me

But
I
fancy
I
have
the
advantage
of
you
when

come

then
I
think
my

get
better

better

I
suppose

fifty
years

I
should
be

blind

everything

Arthur

He

not

something

But
he
saw
her
plainly
enough

saw
her

heightened
beauty

because
he
heard
her
beauty
*NL*
praised

for
other

opinion

you

was

Arthur

it

the
air

the

grew
strong

Yes

She
was
enough
to
turn
any
man

head

any
man
in

place
would
have
done

felt
the

And
to
give
her
up
after
all

as
he

determined

would
be

Mr.

conscious

Oh

that

is

that
there

so
much
tenderness

refinement

Such
a

to
her
ear-rings
again
since
Dinah
's
departure
,
and
was
otherwise
decked
*NL*
out
in
such
small
finery
as
she
could
muster
.
Any
one
who
could
have
*NL*
looked
into
poor
Bessy
's
heart
would
have
seen
a
striking
resemblance
*NL*
between
her
little
hopes
and
anxieties
and
Hetty
's
.
The
advantage
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
would
have
been
on
Bessy
's
side
in
the
matter
of
feeling
.
But
*NL*
then
,
you
see
,
they
were
so
very
different
outside
!
You
would
have
been
*NL*
inclined
to
box
Bessy
's
ears
,
and
you
would
have
longed
to
kiss
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessy
had
been
tempted
to
run
the
arduous
race
,
partly
from
mere
*NL*
hedonish
gaiety
,
partly
because
of
the
prize
.
Some
one
had
said
there
*NL*
were
to
be
cloaks
and
other
nice
clothes
for
prizes
,
and
she
approached
*NL*
the
marquee
,
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
,
but
with
exultation
*NL*
sparkling
in
her
round
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
prize
for
the
first
sack-race
,
''
said
Miss
Lydia
,
taking
a
*NL*
large
parcel
from
the
table
where
the
prizes
were
laid
and
giving
it
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Irwine
before
Bessy
came
up
,
``
an
excellent
grogram
gown
and
a
piece
*NL*
of
flannel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
think
the
winner
was
to
be
so
young
,
I
suppose
,
Aunt
?
''
said
*NL*
Arthur
.
``
Could
n't
you
find
something
else
for
this
girl
,
and
save
that
*NL*
grim-looking
gown
for
one
of
the
older
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
bought
nothing
but
what
is
useful
and
substantial
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Lydia
,
adjusting
her
own
lace
;
``
I
should
not
think
of
encouraging
a
love
*NL*
of
finery
in
young
women
of
that
class
.
I
have
a
scarlet
cloak
,
but
that
*NL*
is
for
the
old
woman
who
wins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
of
Miss
Lydia
's
produced
rather
a
mocking
expression
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Irwine
's
face
as
she
looked
at
Arthur
,
while
Bessy
came
up
and
dropped
a
*NL*
series
of
curtsies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Bessy
Cranage
,
mother
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
kindly
,
``
Chad
*NL*
Cranage
's
daughter
.
You
remember
Chad
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
``
Well
,
Bessy
,
here
is
your
*NL*
prize
--
excellent
warm
things
for
winter
.
I
'm
sure
you
have
had
hard
work
*NL*
to
win
them
this
warm
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bessy
's
lip
fell
as
she
saw
the
ugly
,
heavy
gown
--
which
felt
so
hot
and
*NL*
disagreeable
too
,
on
this
July
day
,
and
was
such
a
great
ugly
thing
to
*NL*
carry
.
She
dropped
her
curtsies
again
,
without
looking
up
,
and
with
a
*NL*
growing
tremulousness
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
,
and
then
turned
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
,
''
said
Arthur
;
``
I
think
she
's
disappointed
.
I
wish
it
had
*NL*
been
something
more
to
her
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
bold-looking
young
person
,
''
observed
Miss
Lydia
.
``
Not
at
all
*NL*
one
I
should
like
to
encourage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
silently
resolved
that
he
would
make
Bessy
a
present
of
money
*NL*
before
the
day
was
over
,
that
she
might
buy
something
more
to
her
mind
;
*NL*
but
she
,
not
aware
of
the
consolation
in
store
for
her
,
turned
out
of
*NL*
the
open
space
,
where
she
was
visible
from
the
marquee
,
and
throwing
*NL*
down
the
odious
bundle
under
a
tree
,
began
to
cry
--
very
much
tittered
at
*NL*
the
while
by
the
small
boys
.
In
this
situation
she
was
descried
by
her
*NL*
discreet
matronly
cousin
,
who
lost
no
time
in
coming
up
,
having
just
*NL*
given
the
baby
into
her
husband
's
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
ye
?
''
said
Bess
the
matron
,
taking
up
the
bundle
*NL*
and
examining
it
.
``
Ye
'n
sweltered
yoursen
,
I
reckon
,
running
that
fool
's
*NL*
race
.
An
'
here
,
they
'n
gi'en
you
lots
o
'
good
grogram
and
flannel
,
as
*NL*
should
ha
'
been
gi'en
by
good
rights
to
them
as
had
the
sense
to
keep
*NL*
away
from
such
foolery
.
Ye
might
spare
me
a
bit
o
'
this
grogram
to
make
*NL*
clothes
for
the
lad
--
ye
war
ne'er
ill-natured
,
Bess
;
I
ne'er
said
that
*NL*
on
ye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
may
take
it
all
,
for
what
I
care
,
''
said
Bess
the
maiden
,
with
a
*NL*
pettish
movement
,
beginning
to
wipe
away
her
tears
and
recover
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
do
wi
`
t
,
if
so
be
ye
want
to
get
rid
o
n't
,
''
said
the
*NL*
disinterested
cousin
,
walking
quickly
away
with
the
bundle
,
lest
Chad
's
*NL*
Bess
should
change
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
bonny-cheeked
lass
was
blessed
with
an
elasticity
of
spirits
*NL*
that
secured
her
from
any
rankling
grief
;
and
by
the
time
the
grand
*NL*
climax
of
the
donkey-race
came
on
,
her
disappointment
was
entirely
lost
*NL*
in
the
delightful
excitement
of
attempting
to
stimulate
the
last
donkey
*NL*
by
hisses
,
while
the
boys
applied
the
argument
of
sticks
.
But
the
*NL*
strength
of
the
donkey
mind
lies
in
adopting
a
course
inversely
as
the
*NL*
arguments
urged
,
which
,
well
considered
,
requires
as
great
a
mental
*NL*
force
as
the
direct
sequence
;
and
the
present
donkey
proved
the
*NL*
first-rate
order
of
his
intelligence
by
coming
to
a
dead
standstill
*NL*
just
when
the
blows
were
thickest
.
Great
was
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
,
*NL*
radiant
the
grinning
of
Bill
Downes
the
stone-sawyer
and
the
fortunate
*NL*
rider
of
this
superior
beast
,
which
stood
calm
and
stiff-legged
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
its
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
himself
had
provided
the
prizes
for
the
men
,
and
Bill
was
made
*NL*
happy
with
a
splendid
pocket-knife
,
supplied
with
blades
and
gimlets
*NL*
enough
to
make
a
man
at
home
on
a
desert
island
.
He
had
hardly
returned
*NL*
from
the
marquee
with
the
prize
in
his
hand
,
when
it
began
to
be
*NL*
understood
that
Wiry
Ben
proposed
to
amuse
the
company
,
before
*NL*
the
gentry
went
to
dinner
,
with
an
impromptu
and
gratuitous
*NL*
performance
--
namely
,
a
hornpipe
,
the
main
idea
of
which
was
doubtless
*NL*
borrowed
;
but
this
was
to
be
developed
by
the
dancer
in
so
peculiar
and
*NL*
complex
a
manner
that
no
one
could
deny
him
the
praise
of
originality
.
*NL*
Wiry
Ben
's
pride
in
his
dancing
--
an
accomplishment
productive
of
great
*NL*
effect
at
the
yearly
Wake
--
had
needed
only
slightly
elevating
by
an
*NL*
extra
quantity
of
good
ale
to
convince
him
that
the
gentry
would
be
*NL*
very
much
struck
with
his
performance
of
his
hornpipe
;
and
he
had
been
*NL*
decidedly
encouraged
in
this
idea
by
Joshua
Rann
,
who
observed
that
it
*NL*
was
nothing
but
right
to
do
something
to
please
the
young
squire
,
in
*NL*
return
for
what
he
had
done
for
them
.
You
will
be
the
less
surprised
*NL*
at
this
opinion
in
so
grave
a
personage
when
you
learn
that
Ben
had
*NL*
requested
Mr.
Rann
to
accompany
him
on
the
fiddle
,
and
Joshua
felt
quite
*NL*
sure
that
though
there
might
not
be
much
in
the
dancing
,
the
music
would
*NL*
make
up
for
it
.
Adam
Bede
,
who
was
present
in
one
of
the
large
marquees
,
*NL*
where
the
plan
was
being
discussed
,
told
Ben
he
had
better
not
make
a
*NL*
fool
of
himself
--
a
remark
which
at
once
fixed
Ben
's
determination
:
he
*NL*
was
not
going
to
let
anything
alone
because
Adam
Bede
turned
up
his
nose
*NL*
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
,
what
's
this
?
''
said
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
.
``
Is
it
something
*NL*
you
've
arranged
,
Arthur
?
Here
's
the
clerk
coming
with
his
fiddle
,
and
a
*NL*
smart
fellow
with
a
nosegay
in
his
button-hole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Arthur
;
``
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
By
Jove
,
he
's
going
to
*NL*
dance
!
It
's
one
of
the
carpenters
--
I
forget
his
name
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Ben
Cranage
--
Wiry
Ben
,
they
call
him
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
;
``
rather
*NL*
a
loose
fish
,
I
think
.
Anne
,
my
dear
,
I
see
that
fiddle-scraping
is
too
*NL*
much
for
you
:
you
're
getting
tired
.
Let
me
take
you
in
now
,
that
you
may
*NL*
rest
till
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Anne
rose
assentingly
,
and
the
good
brother
took
her
away
,
while
*NL*
Joshua
's
preliminary
scrapings
burst
into
the
``
White
Cockade
,
''
from
*NL*
which
he
intended
to
pass
to
a
variety
of
tunes
,
by
a
series
of
*NL*
transitions
which
his
good
ear
really
taught
him
to
execute
with
some
*NL*
skill
.
It
would
have
been
an
exasperating
fact
to
him
,
if
he
had
known
*NL*
it
,
that
the
general
attention
was
too
thoroughly
absorbed
by
Ben
's
*NL*
dancing
for
any
one
to
give
much
heed
to
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
Have
you
ever
seen
a
real
English
rustic
perform
a
solo
dance
?
Perhaps
*NL*
you
have
only
seen
a
ballet
rustic
,
smiling
like
a
merry
countryman
in
*NL*
crockery
,
with
graceful
turns
of
the
haunch
and
insinuating
movements
*NL*
of
the
head
.
That
is
as
much
like
the
real
thing
as
the
``
Bird
Waltz
''
is
*NL*
like
the
song
of
birds
.
Wiry
Ben
never
smiled
:
he
looked
as
serious
as
a
*NL*
dancing
monkey
--
as
serious
as
if
he
had
been
an
experimental
philosopher
*NL*
ascertaining
in
his
own
person
the
amount
of
shaking
and
the
varieties
*NL*
of
angularity
that
could
be
given
to
the
human
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
amends
for
the
abundant
laughter
in
the
striped
marquee
,
Arthur
*NL*
clapped
his
hands
continually
and
cried
``
Bravo
!
''
But
Ben
had
one
admirer
*NL*
whose
eyes
followed
his
movements
with
a
fervid
gravity
that
equalled
*NL*
his
own
.
It
was
Martin
Poyser
,
who
was
seated
on
a
bench
,
with
Tommy
*NL*
between
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
think
o
'
that
?
''
he
said
to
his
wife
.
``
He
goes
as
pat
to
the
*NL*
music
as
if
he
was
made
o
'
clockwork
.
I
used
to
be
a
pretty
good
un
at
*NL*
dancing
myself
when
I
was
lighter
,
but
I
could
niver
ha
'
hit
it
just
to
*NL*
th
'
hair
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
little
matter
what
his
limbs
are
,
to
my
thinking
,
''
re-turned
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
.
``
He
's
empty
enough

the
upper
story

or
he
'd
niver
come

jigging
an

stamping
i

that
way

grasshopper

for
the
gentry
*NL*
to
look
at

They

fit

die
wi

laughing

I
can
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
so
much
the
better
,
it
amuses
'em
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
*NL*
did
not
easily
take
an
irritable
view
of
things
.
``
But
they
're
going
away

now

have
their
dinner

about
a

we

what
Adam
Bede

He

Chapter
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dance
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ARTHUR
had
chosen
the
entrance-hall
for
the
ballroom
:
very
wisely
,
for
*NL*
no
other
room
could
have
been
so
airy
,
or
would
have
had
the
advantage
*NL*
of
the
wide
doors
opening
into
the
garden
,
as
well
as
a
ready
entrance
*NL*
into
the
other
rooms
.
To
be
sure
,
a
stone
floor
was
not
the
pleasantest
*NL*
to
dance
on
,
but
then
,
most
of
the
dancers
had
known
what
it
was
*NL*
to
enjoy
a
Christmas
dance
on
kitchen
quarries
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
entrance-halls
which
make
the
surrounding
rooms
look
like
closets
--
with
*NL*
stucco
angels
,
trumpets
,
and
flower-wreaths
on
the
lofty
ceiling
,
and
*NL*
great
medallions
of
miscellaneous
heroes
on
the
walls
,
alternating
with
*NL*
statues
in
niches
.
Just
the
sort
of
place
to
be
ornamented
well
with
*NL*
green
boughs
,
and
Mr.
Craig
had
been
proud
to
show
his
taste
and
his
*NL*
hothouse
plants
on
the
occasion
.
The
broad
steps
of
the
stone
staircase
*NL*
were
covered
with
cushions
to
serve
as
seats
for
the
children
,
who
were
*NL*
to
stay
till
half-past
nine
with
the
servant-maids
to
see
the
dancing
,
*NL*
and
as
this
dance
was
confined
to
the
chief
tenants
,
there
was
*NL*
abundant
room
for
every
one
.
The
lights
were
charmingly
disposed
in
*NL*
coloured-paper
lamps
,
high
up
among
green
boughs
,
and
the
farmers
'
*NL*
wives
and
daughters
,
as
they
peeped
in
,
believed
no
scene
could
be
more
*NL*
splendid
;
they
knew
now
quite
well
in
what
sort
of
rooms
the
king
and
*NL*
queen
lived
,
and
their
thoughts
glanced
with
some
pity
towards
cousins
*NL*
and
acquaintances
who
had
not
this
fine
opportunity
of
knowing
how
*NL*
things
went
on
in
the
great
world
.
The
lamps
were
already
lit
,
though
*NL*
the
sun
had
not
long
set
,
and
there
was
that
calm
light
out
of
doors
in
*NL*
which
we
seem
to
see
all
objects
more
distinctly
than
in
the
broad
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pretty
scene
outside
the
house
:
the
farmers
and
their
families
*NL*
were
moving
about
the
lawn
,
among
the
flowers
and
shrubs
,
or
along
the
*NL*
broad
straight
road
leading
from
the
east
front
,
where
a
carpet
of
*NL*
mossy
grass
spread
on
each
side
,
studded
here
and
there
with
a
dark
*NL*
flat-boughed
cedar
,
or
a
grand
pyramidal
fir
sweeping
the
ground
with
*NL*
its
branches
,
all
tipped
with
a
fringe
of
paler
green
.
The
groups
of
*NL*
cottagers
in
the
park
were
gradually
diminishing
,
the
young
ones
being
*NL*
attracted
towards
the
lights
that
were
beginning
to
gleam
from
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
gallery
in
the
abbey
,
which
was
to
be
their
dancing-room
,
*NL*
and
some
of
the
sober
elder
ones
thinking
it
time
to
go
home
quietly
.
*NL*
One
of
these
was
Lisbeth
Bede
,
and
Seth
went
with
her
--
not
from
filial
*NL*
attention
only
,
for
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
join
in
dancing
.
*NL*
It
had
been
rather
a
melancholy
day
to
Seth
:
Dinah
had
never
been
more
*NL*
constantly
present
with
him
than
in
this
scene
,
where
everything
was
*NL*
so
unlike
her
.
He
saw
her
all
the
more
vividly
after
looking
at
the
*NL*
thoughtless
faces
and
gay-coloured
dresses
of
the
young
women
--
just
as
*NL*
one
feels
the
beauty
and
the
greatness
of
a
pictured
Madonna
the
more
*NL*
when
it
has
been
for
a
moment
screened
from
us
by
a
vulgar
head
in
a
*NL*
bonnet
.
But
this
presence
of
Dinah
in
his
mind
only
helped
him
to
bear
*NL*
the
better
with
his
mother
's
mood
,
which
had
been
becoming
more
and
more
*NL*
querulous
for
the
last
hour
.
Poor
Lisbeth
was
suffering
from
a
strange
*NL*
conflict
of
feelings
.
Her
joy
and
pride
in
the
honour
paid
to
her
*NL*
darling
son
Adam
was
beginning
to
be
worsted
in
the
conflict
with
the
*NL*
jealousy
and
fretfulness
which
had
revived
when
Adam
came
to
tell
her
*NL*
that
Captain
Donnithorne
desired
him
to
join
the
dancers
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
Adam
was
getting
more
and
more
out
of
her
reach
;
she
wished
all
the
old
*NL*
troubles
back
again
,
for
then
it
mattered
more
to
Adam
what
his
mother
*NL*
said
and
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
it
's
fine
talkin
'
o
'
dancin
'
,
''
she
said
,
``
an
'
thy
father
not
a
five
*NL*
week
in
's
grave
.
An
'
I
wish
I
war
there
too
,
i
`
stid
o
'
bein

left
to
*NL*
take
up

above

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
do
n't
look
at
it
i
'
that
way
,
Mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
who
was
*NL*
determined
to
be
gentle
to
her
to-day
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
to
dance
--
I
shall
*NL*
only
look
on
.
And
since
the
captain
wishes
me
to
be
there
,
it
`
ud
look
*NL*
as
if
I
thought
I
knew
better
than
him
to
say
as
I
'd
rather
not
stay
.
*NL*
And
thee
know
`
st
how
he
's
behaved
to
me
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
thee
'
t
do
as
thee
lik
`
st
,
for
thy
old
mother
's
got
no
right

'
*NL*
hinder
thee
.
She
's
nought
but
th
'
old
husk
,
and
thee
`
st
slipped
away
*NL*
from
her
,
like
the
ripe
nut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mother
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
I
'll
go
and
tell
the
captain
as
it
hurts
thy
*NL*
feelings
for
me
to
stay
,
and
I
'd
rather
go
home
upo
'
that
account
:
he
*NL*
wo
n't
take
it
ill
then
,
I
daresay
,
and
I
'm
willing
.
''
He
said
this
with
*NL*
some
effort
,
for
he
really
longed
to
be
near
Hetty
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
I
wonna
ha
'
thee
do
that
--
the
young
squire
`
ull
be
angered

*NL*
Go

ordered
to

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

good-bye
,
then
,
Mother
--
good-bye
,
lad
--
remember
Gyp
when
you
get
*NL*
home
,
''
said
Adam
,
turning
away
towards
the
gate
of
the
pleasure-grounds
,
*NL*
where
he
hoped
he
might
be
able
to
join
the
Poysers
,
for
he
had
been
so
*NL*
occupied
throughout
the
afternoon
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
speak
to
*NL*
Hetty
.
His
eye
soon
detected
a
distant
group
,
which
he
knew
to
be
the
*NL*
right
one
,
returning
to
the
house
along
the
broad
gravel
road
,
and
he
*NL*
hastened
on
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Adam
,
I
'm
glad
to
get
sight
on
y
'
again
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
was
*NL*
carrying
Totty
on
his
arm
.
``
You
're
going
t
'
have
a
bit
o
'
fun
,
I
hope

*NL*
now
your
work

all
done

And
here
's
Hetty
has
promised
no
end
o

*NL*
partners
,
an
'
I
've
just
been
askin

her
if
she

*NL*
you

an
'
she
says
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
think
o
'
dancing
to-night
,
''
said
Adam
,
already
tempted
*NL*
to
change
his
mind
,
as
he
looked
at
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
Why
,
everybody
's
goin
'
to
dance
to-night
,
*NL*
all
but
th
'
old
squire
and
Mrs.
Irwine
.
Mrs.
Best
's
been
tellin

us
as
*NL*
Miss
Lyddy
and
Miss
Irwine

an

the
young

my
wife
for
his

open
the
ball
:
so
she
'll
be
forced
to
*NL*
dance
,
though
she
's
laid
by
ever
sin

the
Christmas
afore
the
little
un
*NL*
was
born
.
You
canna

still

Adam

an

fellow
and
can
dance
as
well
as
anybody

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

nay

''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
``
it
`
ud
be
unbecomin

I
know
the
dancin

nonsense

if
you
stick
at
everything
because
it
's
nonsense
,
you
*NL*
wonna
go
far

this
life
.
When
your
broth
's
ready-made
for
you
,
you
mun
*NL*
swallow
the
thickenin

,
or
else
let
the
broth
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
Hetty
`
ull
dance
with
me
,
''
said
Adam
,
yielding
either
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
's
argument
or
to
something
else
,
``
I
'll
dance
whichever
dance
*NL*
she
's
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
no
partner
for
the
fourth
dance
,
''
said
Hetty
;
``
I
'll
dance
that
*NL*
with
you
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
``
but
you
mun
dance
the
first
dance
,
Adam
,
else
*NL*
it
'll
look
partic

There
's
plenty
o
'
nice
partners
to
pick
an
'
*NL*
choose
from
,
an
'
it
's
hard
for
the
gells
when
the
men
stan
'
by
and
do
n't
*NL*
ask
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
felt
the
justice
of
Mr.
Poyser
's
observation
:
it
would
not
do
for
*NL*
him
to
dance
with
no
one
besides
Hetty
;
and
remembering
that
Jonathan
*NL*
Burge
had
some
reason
to
feel
hurt
to-day
,
he
resolved
to
ask
Miss
Mary
*NL*
to
dance
with
him
the
first
dance
,
if
she
had
no
other
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
big
clock
strikin
'
eight
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
``
we
must
make
*NL*
haste
in
now
,
else
the
squire
and
the
ladies
`
ull
be
in
afore
us
,
an
'
*NL*
that
wouldna
look
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
entered
the
hall
,
and
the
three
children
under
Molly
's
*NL*
charge
had
been
seated
on
the
stairs
,
the
folding-doors
of
the
*NL*
drawing-room
were
thrown
open
,
and
Arthur
entered
in
his
regimentals
,
*NL*
leading
Mrs.
Irwine
to
a
carpet-covered
dais
ornamented
with
hot-house
*NL*
plants
,
where
she
and
Miss
Anne
were
to
be
seated
with
old
Mr.
*NL*
Donnithorne
,
that
they
might
look
on
at
the
dancing
,
like
the
kings
*NL*
and
queens
in
the
plays
.
Arthur
had
put
on
his
uniform
to
please
the
*NL*
tenants
,
he
said
,
who
thought
as
much
of
his
militia
dignity
as
if
it
*NL*
had
been
an
elevation
to
the
premiership
.
He
had
not
the
least
objection
*NL*
to
gratify
them
in
that
way
:
his
uniform
was
very
advantageous
to
his
*NL*
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
squire
,
before
sitting
down
,
walked
round
the
hall
to
greet
the
*NL*
tenants
and
make
polite
speeches
to
the
wives
:
he
was
always
polite
;
but
*NL*
the
farmers
had
found
out
,
after
long
puzzling
,
that
this
polish
was
*NL*
one
of
the
signs
of
hardness
.
It
was
observed
that
he
gave
his
most
*NL*
elaborate
civility
to
Mrs.
Poyser
to-night
,
inquiring
particularly
about
*NL*
her
health
,
recommending
her
to
strengthen
herself
with
cold
water
as
*NL*
he
did
,
and
avoid
all
drugs
.
Mrs.
Poyser
curtsied
and
thanked
him
with
*NL*
great
self-command
,
but
when
he
had
passed
on
,
she
whispered
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
``
I
'll
lay
my
life
he
's
brewin
'
some
nasty
turn
against
us
.
Old
*NL*
Harry
doesna
wag
his
tail
so
for
nothin
'
.
''
Mr.
Poyser
had
no
time
to
*NL*
answer
,
for
now
Arthur
came
up
and
said
,
``
Mrs.
Poyser
,
I
'm
come
to
*NL*
request
the
favour
of
your
hand
for
the
first
dance
;
and
,
Mr.
Poyser
,
*NL*
you
must
let
me
take
you
to
my
aunt
,
for
she
claims
you
as
her
partner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
's
pale
cheek
flushed
with
a
nervous
sense
of
unwonted
honour
as
*NL*
Arthur
led
her
to
the
top
of
the
room
;
but
Mr.
Poyser
,
to
whom
an
extra
*NL*
glass
had
restored
his
youthful
confidence
in
his
good
looks
and
good
*NL*
dancing
,
walked
along
with
them
quite
proudly
,
secretly
flattering
*NL*
himself
that
Miss
Lydia
had
never
had
a
partner
in
HER
life
who
could
*NL*
lift
her
off
the
ground
as
he
would
.
In
order
to
balance
the
honours
*NL*
given
to
the
two
parishes
,
Miss
Irwine
danced
with
Luke
Britton
,
the
*NL*
largest
Broxton
farmer
,
and
Mr.
Gawaine
led
out
Mrs.
Britton
.
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
,
after
seating
his
sister
Anne
,
had
gone
to
the
abbey
gallery
,
*NL*
as
he
had
agreed
with
Arthur
beforehand
,
to
see
how
the
merriment
of
the
*NL*
cottagers
was
prospering
.
Meanwhile
,
all
the
less
distinguished
couples
*NL*
had
taken
their
places
:
Hetty
was
led
out
by
the
inevitable
Mr.
Craig
,
*NL*
and
Mary
Burge
by
Adam
;
and
now
the
music
struck
up
,
and
the
glorious
*NL*
country-dance
,
best
of
all
dances
,
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pity
it
was
not
a
boarded
floor
!
Then
the
rhythmic
stamping
of
the
thick
*NL*
shoes
would
have
been
better
than
any
drums
.
That
merry
stamping
,
that
*NL*
gracious
nodding
of
the
head
,
that
waving
bestowal
of
the
hand
--
where
*NL*
can
we
see
them
now
?
That
simple
dancing
of
well-covered
matrons
,
laying
*NL*
aside
for
an
hour
the
cares
of
house
and
dairy
,
remembering
but
not
*NL*
affecting
youth
,
not
jealous
but
proud
of
the
young
maidens
by
their
*NL*
side
--
that
holiday
sprightliness
of
portly
husbands
paying
little
*NL*
compliments
to
their
wives
,
as
if
their
courting
days
were
come
*NL*
again
--
those
lads
and
lasses
a
little
confused
and
awkward
with
their
*NL*
partners
,
having
nothing
to
say
--
it
would
be
a
pleasant
variety
to
*NL*
see
all
that
sometimes
,
instead
of
low
dresses
and
large
skirts
,
and
*NL*
scanning
glances
exploring
costumes
,
and
languid
men
in
lacquered
boots
*NL*
smiling
with
double
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
thing
to
mar
Martin
Poyser
's
pleasure
in
this
dance
:
*NL*
it
was
that
he
was
always
in
close
contact
with
Luke
Britton
,
that
*NL*
slovenly
farmer
.
He
thought
of
throwing
a
little
glazed
coldness
into
*NL*
his
eye
in
the
crossing
of
hands
;
but
then
,
as
Miss
Irwine
was
opposite
*NL*
to
him
instead
of
the
offensive
Luke
,
he
might
freeze
the
wrong
person
.
*NL*
So
he
gave
his
face
up
to
hilarity
,
unchilled
by
moral
judgments
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Hetty
's
heart
beat
as
Arthur
approached
her
!
He
had
hardly
looked
at
*NL*
her
to-day
:
now
he
must
take
her
hand
.
Would
he
press
it
?
Would
he
look
*NL*
at
her
?
She
thought
she
would
cry
if
he
gave
her
no
sign
of
feeling
.
*NL*
Now
he
was
there
--
he
had
taken
her
hand
--
yes
,
he
was
pressing
it
.
Hetty
*NL*
turned
pale
as
she
looked
up
at
him
for
an
instant
and
met
his
eyes
,
*NL*
before
the
dance
carried
him
away
.
That
pale
look
came
upon
Arthur
like
*NL*
the
beginning
of
a
dull
pain
,
which
clung
to
him
,
though
he
must
dance
*NL*
and
smile
and
joke
all
the
same
.
Hetty
would
look
so
,
when
he
told
her
*NL*
what
he
had
to
tell
her
;
and
he
should
never
be
able
to
bear
it
--
he
*NL*
should
be
a
fool
and
give
way
again
.
Hetty
's
look
did
not
really
mean
*NL*
so
much
as
he
thought
:
it
was
only
the
sign
of
a
struggle
between
the
*NL*
desire
for
him
to
notice
her
and
the
dread
lest
she
should
betray
the
*NL*
desire
to
others
.
But
Hetty
's
face
had
a
language
that
transcended
her
*NL*
feelings
.
There
are
faces
which
nature
charges
with
a
meaning
and
pathos
*NL*
not
belonging
to
the
single
human
soul
that
flutters
beneath
them
,
but
*NL*
speaking
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
foregone
generations
--
eyes
that
tell
of
*NL*
deep
love
which
doubtless
has
been
and
is
somewhere
,
but
not
paired
with
*NL*
these
eyes
--
perhaps
paired
with
pale
eyes
that
can
say
nothing
;
just
as
*NL*
a
national
language
may
be
instinct
with
poetry
unfelt
by
the
lips
that
*NL*
use
it
.
That
look
of
Hetty
's
oppressed
Arthur
with
a
dread
which
yet
had
*NL*
something
of
a
terrible
unconfessed
delight
in
it
,
that
she
loved
him
*NL*
too
well
.
There
was
a
hard
task
before
him
,
for
at
that
moment
he
felt
*NL*
he
would
have
given
up
three
years
of
his
youth
for
the
happiness
of
*NL*
abandoning
himself
without
remorse
to
his
passion
for
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
incongruous
thoughts
in
his
mind
as
he
led
Mrs.
Poyser
,
*NL*
who
was
panting
with
fatigue
,
and
secretly
resolving
that
neither
judge
*NL*
nor
jury
should
force
her
to
dance
another
dance
,
to
take
a
quiet
rest
*NL*
in
the
dining-room
,
where
supper
was
laid
out
for
the
guests
to
come
and
*NL*
take
it
as
they
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
desired
Hetty
to
remember
as
she
's
got
to
dance
wi
'
you
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
the
good
innocent
woman
;
``
for
she
's
so
thoughtless
,
she
'd
be
like
*NL*
enough
to
go
an
'
engage
herself
for
ivery
dance
.
So
I
told
her
not
to
*NL*
promise
too
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
''
said
Arthur
,
not
without
a
twinge
.
``
Now
,
sit
*NL*
down
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
and
here
is
Mills
ready
to
give
you
what
*NL*
you
would
like
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
away
to
seek
another
matronly
partner
,
for
due
honour
must
be
*NL*
paid
to
the
married
women
before
he
asked
any
of
the
young
ones
;
and
*NL*
the
country-dances
,
and
the
stamping
,
and
the
gracious
nodding
,
and
the
*NL*
waving
of
the
hands
,
went
on
joyously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
time
had
come
for
the
fourth
dance
--
longed
for
by
the
*NL*
strong
,
grave
Adam
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
delicate-handed
youth
of
*NL*
eighteen
;
for
we
are
all
very
much
alike
when
we
are
in
our
first
love
;
*NL*
and
Adam
had
hardly
ever
touched
Hetty
's
hand
for
more
than
a
transient
*NL*
greeting
--
had
never
danced
with
her
but
once
before
.
His
eyes
had
*NL*
followed
her
eagerly
to-night
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
had
taken
in
*NL*
deeper
draughts
of
love
.
He
thought
she
behaved
so
prettily
,
so
quietly
;
*NL*
she
did
not
seem
to
be
flirting
at
all
she
smiled
less
than
usual
;
there
*NL*
was
almost
a
sweet
sadness
about
her
.
``
God
bless
her
!
''
he
said
inwardly
;
*NL*
``
I
'd
make
her
life
a
happy
`
un
,
if
a
strong
arm
to
work
for
her
,
and
a
*NL*
heart
to
love
her
,
could
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
there
stole
over
him
delicious
thoughts
of
coming
home
from
*NL*
work
,
and
drawing
Hetty
to
his
side
,
and
feeling
her
cheek
softly
*NL*
pressed
against
his
,
till
he
forgot
where
he
was
,
and
the
music
and
the
*NL*
tread
of
feet
might
have
been
the
falling
of
rain
and
the
roaring
of
the
*NL*
wind
,
for
what
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
the
third
dance
was
ended
,
and
he
might
go
up
to
her
and
*NL*
claim
her
hand
.
She
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
near
the
staircase
,
*NL*
whispering
with
Molly
,
who
had
just
given
the
sleeping
Totty
into
her
*NL*
arms
before
running
to
fetch
shawls
and
bonnets
from
the
landing
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
had
taken
the
two
boys
away
into
the
dining-room
to
give
them
*NL*
some
cake
before
they
went
home
in
the
cart
with
Grandfather
and
Molly
*NL*
was
to
follow
as
fast
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hold
her
,
''
said
Adam
,
as
Molly
turned
upstairs
;
``
the
children
*NL*
are
so
heavy
when
they
're
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
glad
of
the
relief
,
for
to
hold
Totty
in
her
arms
,
standing
,
*NL*
was
not
at
all
a
pleasant
variety
to
her
.
But
this
second
transfer
had
*NL*
the
unfortunate
effect
of
rousing
Totty
,
who
was
not
behind
any
child
*NL*
of
her
age
in
peevishness
at
an
unseasonable
awaking
.
While
Hetty
was
*NL*
in
the
act
of
placing
her
in
Adam
's
arms
,
and
had
not
yet
withdrawn
her
*NL*
own
,
Totty
opened
her
eyes
,
and
forthwith
fought
out
with
her
left
fist
*NL*
at
Adam
's
arm
,
and
with
her
right
caught
at
the
string
of
brown
beads
*NL*
round
Hetty
's
neck
.
The
locket
leaped
out
from
her
frock
,
and
the
next
*NL*
moment
the
string
was
broken
,
and
Hetty
,
helpless
,
saw
beads
and
locket
*NL*
scattered
wide
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
locket
,
my
locket
!
''
she
said
,
in
a
loud
frightened
whisper
to
Adam
;
*NL*
``
never
mind
the
beads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
already
seen
where
the
locket
fell
,
for
it
had
attracted
his
*NL*
glance
as
it
leaped
out
of
her
frock
.
It
had
fallen
on
the
raised
wooden
*NL*
dais
where
the
band
sat
,
not
on
the
stone
floor
;
and
as
Adam
picked
it
*NL*
up
,
he
saw
the
glass
with
the
dark
and
light
locks
of
hair
under
it
.
It
*NL*
had
fallen
that
side
upwards
,
so
the
glass
was
not
broken
.
He
turned
it
*NL*
over
on
his
hand
,
and
saw
the
enamelled
gold
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
hurt
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
held
it
towards
Hetty
,
who
was
unable
to
*NL*
take
it
because
both
her
hands
were
occupied
with
Totty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
I
do
n't
mind
about
it
,
''
said
Hetty
,
who
had
been
*NL*
pale
and
was
now
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
matter
?
''
said
Adam
,
gravely
.
``
You
seemed
very
frightened
about
it
.
*NL*
I
'll
hold
it
till
you
're
ready
to
take
it
,
''
he
added
,
quietly
closing
*NL*
his
hand
over
it
,
that
she
might
not
think
he
wanted
to
look
at
it
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Molly
had
come
with
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
had
taken
Totty
,
Adam
placed
the
locket
in
Hetty
's
hand
.
She
took
it
*NL*
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
in
her
heart
vexed
*NL*
and
angry
with
Adam
because
he
had
seen
it
,
but
determined
now
that
she
*NL*
would
show
no
more
signs
of
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
she
said
,
``
they
're
taking
their
places
to
dance
;
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
assented
silently
.
A
puzzled
alarm
had
taken
possession
of
him
.
Had
*NL*
Hetty
a
lover
he
did
n't
know
of
?
For
none
of
her
relations
,
he
was
sure
,
*NL*
would
give
her
a
locket
like
that
;
and
none
of
her
admirers
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
was
acquainted
,
was
in
the
position
of
an
accepted
lover
,
as
the
*NL*
giver
of
that
locket
must
be
.
Adam
was
lost
in
the
utter
impossibility
*NL*
of
finding
any
person
for
his
fears
to
alight
on
.
He
could
only
feel
*NL*
with
a
terrible
pang
that
there
was
something
in
Hetty
's
life
unknown
to
*NL*
him
;
that
while
he
had
been
rocking
himself
in
the
hope
that
she
would
*NL*
come
to
love
him
,
she
was
already
loving
another
.
The
pleasure
of
the
*NL*
dance
with
Hetty
was
gone
;
his
eyes
,
when
they
rested
on
her
,
had
an
*NL*
uneasy
questioning
expression
in
them
;
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
*NL*
to
her
;
and
she
too
was
out
of
temper
and
disinclined
to
speak
.
They
*NL*
were
both
glad
when
the
dance
was
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
determined
to
stay
no
longer
;
no
one
wanted
him
,
and
no
one
*NL*
would
notice
if
he
slipped
away
.
As
soon
as
he
got
out
of
doors
,
he
*NL*
began
to
walk
at
his
habitual
rapid
pace
,
hurrying
along
without
knowing
*NL*
why
,
busy
with
the
painful
thought
that
the
memory
of
this
day
,
so
full
*NL*
of
honour
and
promise
to
him
,
was
poisoned
for
ever
.
Suddenly
,
when
*NL*
he
was
far
on
through
the
Chase
,
he
stopped
,
startled
by
a
flash
of
*NL*
reviving
hope
.
After
all
,
he
might
be
a
fool
,
making
a
great
misery
out
*NL*
of
a
trifle
.
Hetty
,
fond
of
finery
as
she
was
,
might
have
bought
the
*NL*
thing
herself
.
It
looked
too
expensive
for
that
--
it
looked
like
the
*NL*
things
on
white
satin
in
the
great
jeweller
's
shop
at
Rosseter
.
But
Adam
*NL*
had
very
imperfect
notions
of
the
value
of
such
things
,
and
he
thought
*NL*
it
could
certainly
not
cost
more
than
a
guinea
.
Perhaps
Hetty
had
had
as
*NL*
much
as
that
in
Christmas
boxes
,
and
there
was
no
knowing
but
she
might
*NL*
have
been
childish
enough
to
spend
it
in
that
way
;
she
was
such
a
young
*NL*
thing
,
and
she
could
n't
help
loving
finery
!
But
then
,
why
had
she
been
*NL*
so
frightened
about
it
at
first
,
and
changed
colour
so
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
pretended
not
to
care
?
Oh
,
that
was
because
she
was
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
seeing
that
she
had
such
a
smart
thing
--
she
was
conscious
that
it
*NL*
was
wrong
for
her
to
spend
her
money
on
it
,
and
she
knew
that
Adam
*NL*
disapproved
of
finery
.
It
was
a
proof
she
cared
about
what
he
liked
and
*NL*
disliked
.
She
must
have
thought
from
his
silence
and
gravity
afterwards
*NL*
that
he
was
very
much
displeased
with
her
,
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
*NL*
harsh
and
severe
towards
her
foibles
.
And
as
he
walked
on
more
quietly
,
*NL*
chewing
the
cud
of
this
new
hope
,
his
only
uneasiness
was
that
he
had
*NL*
behaved
in
a
way
which
might
chill
Hetty
's
feeling
towards
him
.
For
this
*NL*
last
view
of
the
matter
must
be
the
true
one
.
How
could
Hetty
have
*NL*
an
accepted
lover
,
quite
unknown
to
him
?
She
was
never
away
from
her
*NL*
uncle
's
house
for
more
than
a
day
;
she
could
have
no
acquaintances
that
*NL*
did
not
come
there
,
and
no
intimacies
unknown
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
It
*NL*
would
be
folly
to
believe
that
the
locket
was
given
to
her
by
a
lover
.
*NL*
The
little
ring
of
dark
hair
he
felt
sure
was
her
own
;
he
could
form
*NL*
no
guess
about
the
light
hair
under
it
,
for
he
had
not
seen
it
very
*NL*
distinctly
.
It
might
be
a
bit
of
her
father
's
or
mother
's
,
who
had
died
*NL*
when
she
was
a
child
,
and
she
would
naturally
put
a
bit
of
her
own
along
*NL*
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
Adam
went
to
bed
comforted
,
having
woven
for
himself
an
ingenious
*NL*
web
of
probabilities
--
the
surest
screen
a
wise
man
can
place
between
*NL*
himself
and
the
truth
.
His
last
waking
thoughts
melted
into
a
dream
that
*NL*
he
was
with
Hetty
again
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
that
he
was
asking
her
to
*NL*
forgive
him
for
being
so
cold
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
he
was
dreaming
this
,
Arthur
was
leading
Hetty
to
the
dance
*NL*
and
saying
to
her
in
low
hurried
tones
,
``
I
shall
be
in
the
wood
the
day
*NL*
after
to-morrow
at
seven
;
come
as
early
as
you
can
.
''
And
Hetty
's
foolish
*NL*
joys
and
hopes
,
which
had
flown
away
for
a
little
space
,
scared
by
a
*NL*
mere
nothing
,
now
all
came
fluttering
back
,
unconscious
of
the
real
*NL*
peril
.
She
was
happy
for
the
first
time
this
long
day
,
and
wished
*NL*
that
dance
would
last
for
hours
.
Arthur
wished
it
too
;
it
was
the
*NL*
last
weakness
he
meant
to
indulge
in
;
and
a
man
never
lies
with
more
*NL*
delicious
languor
under
the
influence
of
a
passion
than
when
he
has
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
he
shall
subdue
it
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Poyser
's
wishes
were
quite
the
reverse
of
this
,
for
her
mind
*NL*
was
filled
with
dreary
forebodings
as
to
the
retardation
of
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
's
cheese
in
consequence
of
these
late
hours
.
Now
that
Hetty
had
*NL*
done
her
duty
and
danced
one
dance
with
the
young
squire
,
Mr.
Poyser
*NL*
must
go
out
and
see
if
the
cart
was
come
back
to
fetch
them
,
for
it
was
*NL*
half-past
ten
o'clock
,
and
notwithstanding
a
mild
suggestion
on
his
part
*NL*
that
it
would
be
bad
manners
for
them
to
be
the
first
to
go
,
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
was
resolute
on
the
point
,
``
manners
or
no
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Going
already
,
Mrs.
Poyser
?
''
said
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
as
she
*NL*
came
to
curtsy
and
take
leave
;
``
I
thought
we
should
not
part
with
any
of
*NL*
our
guests
till
eleven
.
Mrs.
Irwine
and
I
,
who
are
elderly
people
,
think
*NL*
of
sitting
out
the
dance
till
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Your
Honour
,
it
's
all
right
and
proper
for
gentlefolks
to
stay
up
*NL*
by
candlelight
--
they
've
got
no
cheese
on
their
minds
.
We
're
late
enough
*NL*
as
it
is
,
an

there
's
no
lettin

the
cows
know
as
they
must
n't
want
to

milked

.
So
,
if
you
'll
please
t
'
excuse
us
,
*NL*
we
'll
take
our
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
she
said
to
her
husband
,
as
they
set
off
in
the
cart
,
``
I
'd
sooner
*NL*
ha
'
brewin

There

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

who
was
in

that
*NL*
he
had
had
a
great

*NL*
A
crisis
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
beyond
the
middle
of
August
--
nearly
three
weeks
after
the
*NL*
birthday
feast
.
The
reaping
of
the
wheat
had
begun
in
our
north
midland
*NL*
county
of
Loamshire
,
but
the
harvest
was
likely
still
to
be
retarded
*NL*
by
the
heavy
rains
,
which
were
causing
inundations
and
much
damage
*NL*
throughout
the
country
.
From
this
last
trouble
the
Broxton
and
Hayslope
*NL*
farmers
,
on
their
pleasant
uplands
and
in
their
brook-watered
*NL*
valleys
,
had
not
suffered
,
and
as
I
can
not
pretend
that
they
were
such
*NL*
exceptional
farmers
as
to
love
the
general
good
better
than
their
own
,
*NL*
you
will
infer
that
they
were
not
in
very
low
spirits
about
the
rapid
*NL*
rise
in
the
price
of
bread
,
so
long
as
there
was
hope
of
gathering
in
*NL*
their
own
corn
undamaged
;
and
occasional
days
of
sunshine
and
drying
*NL*
winds
flattered
this
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eighteenth
of
August
was
one
of
these
days
when
the
sunshine
looked
*NL*
brighter
in
all
eyes
for
the
gloom
that
went
before
.
Grand
masses
of
*NL*
cloud
were
hurried
across
the
blue
,
and
the
great
round
hills
behind
the
*NL*
Chase
seemed
alive
with
their
flying
shadows
;
the
sun
was
hidden
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
then
shone
out
warm
again
like
a
recovered
joy
;
the
leaves
,
*NL*
still
green
,
were
tossed
off
the
hedgerow
trees
by
the
wind
;
around
the
*NL*
farmhouses
there
was
a
sound
of
clapping
doors
;
the
apples
fell
in
the
*NL*
orchards
;
and
the
stray
horses
on
the
green
sides
of
the
lanes
and
on
*NL*
the
common
had
their
manes
blown
about
their
faces
.
And
yet
the
wind
*NL*
seemed
only
part
of
the
general
gladness
because
the
sun
was
shining
.
A
*NL*
merry
day
for
the
children
,
who
ran
and
shouted
to
see
if
they
could
*NL*
top
the
wind
with
their
voices
;
and
the
grown-up
people
too
were
in
*NL*
good
spirits
,
inclined
to
believe
in
yet
finer
days
,
when
the
wind
had
*NL*
fallen
.
If
only
the
corn
were
not
ripe
enough
to
be
blown
out
of
the
*NL*
husk
and
scattered
as
untimely
seed
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
a
day
on
which
a
blighting
sorrow
may
fall
upon
a
man
.
For
if
it
*NL*
be
true
that
Nature
at
certain
moments
seems
charged
with
a
presentiment
*NL*
of
one
individual
lot
must
it
not
also
be
true
that
she
seems
unmindful
*NL*
unconscious
of
another
?
For
there
is
no
hour
that
has
not
its
births
*NL*
of
gladness
and
despair
,
no
morning
brightness
that
does
not
bring
new
*NL*
sickness
to
desolation
as
well
as
new
forces
to
genius
and
love
.
There
*NL*
are
so
many
of
us
,
and
our
lots
are
so
different
,
what
wonder
that
*NL*
Nature
's
mood
is
often
in
harsh
contrast
with
the
great
crisis
of
*NL*
our
lives
?
We
are
children
of
a
large
family
,
and
must
learn
,
as
such
*NL*
children
do
,
not
to
expect
that
our
hurts
will
be
made
much
of
--
to
be
*NL*
content
with
little
nurture
and
caressing
,
and
help
each
other
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
busy
day
with
Adam
,
who
of
late
had
done
almost
double
work
,
*NL*
for
he
was
continuing
to
act
as
foreman
for
Jonathan
Burge
,
until
some
*NL*
satisfactory
person
could
be
found
to
supply
his
place
,
and
Jonathan
was
*NL*
slow
to
find
that
person
.
But
he
had
done
the
extra
work
cheerfully
,
for
*NL*
his
hopes
were
buoyant
again
about
Hetty
.
Every
time
she
had
seen
him
*NL*
since
the
birthday
,
she
had
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
behave
all
the
*NL*
more
kindly
to
him
,
that
she
might
make
him
understand
she
had
forgiven
*NL*
his
silence
and
coldness
during
the
dance
.
He
had
never
mentioned
the
*NL*
locket
to
her
again
;
too
happy
that
she
smiled
at
him
--
still
happier
*NL*
because
he
observed
in
her
a
more
subdued
air
,
something
that
he
*NL*
interpreted
as
the
growth
of
womanly
tenderness
and
seriousness
.
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
again
and
again
,
``
she
's
only
seventeen
;
she
'll
be
thoughtful
*NL*
enough
after
a
while
.
And
her
aunt
allays
says
how
clever
she
is
at
the
*NL*
work
.
She
'll
make
a
wife
as
Mother
'll
have
no
occasion
to
grumble
at
,
*NL*
after
all
.
''
To
be
sure
,
he
had
only
seen
her
at
home
twice
since
the
*NL*
birthday
;
for
one
Sunday
,
when
he
was
intending
to
go
from
church
to
the
*NL*
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
had
joined
the
party
of
upper
servants
from
the
Chase
*NL*
and
had
gone
home
with
them
--
almost
as
if
she
were
inclined
to
encourage
*NL*
Mr.
Craig
.
``
She
's
takin
'
too
much
likin
'
to
them
folks
i
'
the
house
*NL*
keeper
's
room
,
''
Mrs.
Poyser
remarked
.
``
For
my
part
,
I
was
never
overfond
*NL*
o
'
gentlefolks
's
servants
--
they
're
mostly
like
the
fine
ladies
'
fat
*NL*
dogs
,
nayther
good
for
barking
nor
butcher
's
meat
,
but
on
'
y
for
show
.
''
*NL*
And
another
evening
she
was
gone
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
things
;
*NL*
though
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
as
he
was
returning
home
,
he
saw
her
at
*NL*
a
distance
getting
over
a
stile
quite
out
of
the
Treddleston
road
.
But
,
*NL*
when
he
hastened
to
her
,
she
was
very
kind
,
and
asked
him
to
go
in
again
*NL*
when
he
had
taken
her
to
the
yard
gate
.
She
had
gone
a
little
farther
*NL*
into
the
fields
after
coming
from
Treddleston
because
she
did
n't
want
to
*NL*
go
in
,
she
said
:
it
was
so
nice
to
be
out
of
doors
,
and
her
aunt
always
*NL*
made
such
a
fuss
about
it
if
she
wanted
to
go
out
.
``
Oh
,
do
come
in
with
*NL*
me
!
''
she
said
,
as
he
was
going
to
shake
hands
with
her
at
the
gate
,
and
*NL*
he
could
not
resist
that
.
So
he
went
in
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
was
contented
*NL*
with
only
a
slight
remark
on
Hetty
's
being
later
than
was
expected
;
*NL*
while
Hetty
,
who
had
looked
out
of
spirits
when
he
met
her
,
smiled
and
*NL*
talked
and
waited
on
them
all
with
unusual
promptitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
last
time
he
had
seen
her
;
but
he
meant
to
make
leisure
for
*NL*
going
to
the
Farm
to-morrow
.
To-day
,
he
knew
,
was
her
day
for
going
to
*NL*
the
Chase
to
sew
with
the
lady
's
maid
,
so
he
would
get
as
much
work
done
*NL*
as
possible
this
evening
,
that
the
next
might
be
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
piece
of
work
that
Adam
was
superintending
was
some
slight
repairs
*NL*
at
the
Chase
Farm
,
which
had
been
hitherto
occupied
by
Satchell
,
as
*NL*
bailiff
,
but
which
it
was
now
rumoured
that
the
old
squire
was
going
to
*NL*
let
to
a
smart
man
in
top-boots
,
who
had
been
seen
to
ride
over
it
*NL*
one
day
.
Nothing
but
the
desire
to
get
a
tenant
could
account
for
the
*NL*
squire
's
undertaking
repairs
,
though
the
Saturday-evening
party
at
Mr.
*NL*
Casson
's
agreed
over
their
pipes
that
no
man
in
his
senses
would
take
*NL*
the
Chase
Farm
unless
there
was
a
bit
more
ploughland
laid
to
it
.
*NL*
However
that
might
be
,
the
repairs
were
ordered
to
be
executed
with
all
*NL*
dispatch
,
and
Adam
,
acting
for
Mr.
Burge
,
was
carrying
out
the
order
*NL*
with
his
usual
energy
.
But
to-day
,
having
been
occupied
elsewhere
,
*NL*
he
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
at
the
Chase
Farm
till
late
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
he
then
discovered
that
some
old
roofing
,
which
he
had
*NL*
calculated
on
preserving
,
had
given
way
.
There
was
clearly
no
good
to
*NL*
be
done
with
this
part
of
the
building
without
pulling
it
all
down
,
and
*NL*
Adam
immediately
saw
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
building
it
up
again
,
so
as
*NL*
to
make
the
most
convenient
of
cow-sheds
and
calf-pens
,
with
a
hovel
for
*NL*
implements
;
and
all
without
any
great
expense
for
materials
.
So
,
when
*NL*
the
workmen
were
gone
,
he
sat
down
,
took
out
his
pocket-book
,
and
*NL*
busied
himself
with
sketching
a
plan
,
and
making
a
specification
of
the
*NL*
expenses
that
he
might
show
it
to
Burge
the
next
morning
,
and
set
him
*NL*
on
persuading
the
squire
to
consent
.
To
``
make
a
good
job
''
of
anything
,
*NL*
however
small
,
was
always
a
pleasure
to
Adam
,
and
he
sat
on
a
block
,
*NL*
with
his
book
resting
on
a
planing-table
,
whistling
low
every
now
and
*NL*
then
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
just
perceptible
smile
of
*NL*
gratification
--
of
pride
,
too
,
for
if
Adam
loved
a
bit
of
good
work
,
he
*NL*
loved
also
to
think
,
``
I
did
it
!
''
And
I
believe
the
only
people
who
are
*NL*
free
from
that
weakness
are
those
who
have
no
work
to
call
their
own
.
It
*NL*
was
nearly
seven
before
he
had
finished
and
put
on
his
jacket
again
;
and
*NL*
on
giving
a
last
look
round
,
he
observed
that
Seth
,
who
had
been
working
*NL*
here
to-day
,
had
left
his
basket
of
tools
behind
him
.
``
Why
,
th
'
lad
's
*NL*
forgot
his
tools
,
''
thought
Adam
,
``
and
he
's
got
to
work
up
at
the
shop
*NL*
to-morrow
.
There
never
was
such
a
chap
for
wool-gathering
;
he
'd
leave
*NL*
his
head
behind
him
,
if
it
was
loose
.
However
,
it
's
lucky
I
've
seen
'em
;
*NL*
I
'll
carry
'em
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
buildings
of
the
Chase
Farm
lay
at
one
extremity
of
the
Chase
,
*NL*
at
about
ten
minutes
'
walking
distance
from
the
Abbey
.
Adam
had
come
*NL*
thither
on
his
pony
,
intending
to
ride
to
the
stables
and
put
up
his
nag
*NL*
on
his
way
home
.
At
the
stables
he
encountered
Mr.
Craig
,
who
had
come
*NL*
to
look
at
the
captain
's
new
horse
,
on
which
he
was
to
ride
away
the
day
*NL*
after
to-morrow
;
and
Mr.
Craig
detained
him
to
tell
how
all
the
servants
*NL*
were
to
collect
at
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
to
wish
the
young
squire
*NL*
luck
as
he
rode
out
;
so
that
by
the
time
Adam
had
got
into
the
Chase
,
*NL*
and
was
striding
along
with
the
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
the
*NL*
sun
was
on
the
point
of
setting
,
and
was
sending
level
crimson
rays
*NL*
among
the
great
trunks
of
the
old
oaks
,
and
touching
every
bare
patch
of
*NL*
ground
with
a
transient
glory
that
made
it
look
like
a
jewel
dropt
upon
*NL*
the
grass
.
The
wind
had
fallen
now
,
and
there
was
only
enough
breeze
to
*NL*
stir
the
delicate-stemmed
leaves
.
Any
one
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
*NL*
house
all
day
would
have
been
glad
to
walk
now
;
but
Adam
had
been
quite
*NL*
enough
in
the
open
air
to
wish
to
shorten
his
way
home
,
and
he
bethought
*NL*
himself
that
he
might
do
so
by
striking
across
the
Chase
and
going
*NL*
through
the
Grove
,
where
he
had
never
been
for
years
.
He
hurried
on
*NL*
across
the
Chase
,
stalking
along
the
narrow
paths
between
the
fern
,
with
*NL*
Gyp
at
his
heels
,
not
lingering
to
watch
the
magnificent
changes
of
the
*NL*
light
--
hardly
once
thinking
of
it
--
yet
feeling
its
presence
in
a
certain
*NL*
calm
happy
awe
which
mingled
itself
with
his
busy
working-day
thoughts
.
*NL*
How
could
he
help
feeling
it
?
The
very
deer
felt
it
,
and
were
more
*NL*
timid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Adam
's
thoughts
recurred
to
what
Mr.
Craig
had
said
about
*NL*
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
and
pictured
his
going
away
,
and
the
changes
*NL*
that
might
take
place
before
he
came
back
;
then
they
travelled
back
*NL*
affectionately
over
the
old
scenes
of
boyish
companionship
,
and
dwelt
*NL*
on
Arthur
's
good
qualities
,
which
Adam
had
a
pride
in
,
as
we
all
have
in
*NL*
the
virtues
of
the
superior
who
honours
us
.
A
nature
like
Adam
's
,
with
*NL*
a
great
need
of
love
and
reverence
in
it
,
depends
for
so
much
of
its
*NL*
happiness
on
what
it
can
believe
and
feel
about
others
!
And
he
had
no
*NL*
ideal
world
of
dead
heroes
;
he
knew
little
of
the
life
of
men
in
*NL*
the
past
;
he
must
find
the
beings
to
whom
he
could
cling
with
loving
*NL*
admiration
among
those
who
came
within
speech
of
him
.
These
pleasant
*NL*
thoughts
about
Arthur
brought
a
milder
expression
than
usual
into
his
*NL*
keen
rough
face
:
perhaps
they
were
the
reason
why
,
when
he
opened
the
*NL*
old
green
gate
leading
into
the
Grove
,
he
paused
to
pat
Gyp
and
say
a
*NL*
kind
word
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
pause
,
he
strode
on
again
along
the
broad
winding
path
*NL*
through
the
Grove
.
What
grand
beeches
!
Adam
delighted
in
a
fine
tree
of
*NL*
all
things
;
as
the
fisherman
's
sight
is
keenest
on
the
sea
,
so
Adam
's
*NL*
perceptions
were
more
at
home
with
trees
than
with
other
objects
.
He
*NL*
kept
them
in
his
memory
,
as
a
painter
does
,
with
all
the
flecks
and
*NL*
knots
in
their
bark
,
all
the
curves
and
angles
of
their
boughs
,
and
had
*NL*
often
calculated
the
height
and
contents
of
a
trunk
to
a
nicety
,
as
he
*NL*
stood
looking
at
it
.
No
wonder
that
,
not-withstanding
his
desire
to
get
*NL*
on
,
he
could
not
help
pausing
to
look
at
a
curious
large
beech
which
*NL*
he
had
seen
standing
before
him
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
convince
*NL*
himself
that
it
was
not
two
trees
wedded
together
,
but
only
one
.
For
the
*NL*
rest
of
his
life
he
remembered
that
moment
when
he
was
calmly
examining
*NL*
the
beech
,
as
a
man
remembers
his
last
glimpse
of
the
home
where
his
*NL*
youth
was
passed
,
before
the
road
turned
,
and
he
saw
it
no
more
.
The
*NL*
beech
stood
at
the
last
turning
before
the
Grove
ended
in
an
archway
of
*NL*
boughs
that
let
in
the
eastern
light
;
and
as
Adam
stepped
away
from
the
*NL*
tree
to
continue
his
walk
,
his
eyes
fell
on
two
figures
about
twenty
*NL*
yards
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
as
motionless
as
a
statue
,
and
turned
almost
as
pale
.
The
*NL*
two
figures
were
standing
opposite
to
each
other
,
with
clasped
hands
*NL*
about
to
part
;
and
while
they
were
bending
to
kiss
,
Gyp
,
who
had
been
*NL*
running
among
the
brushwood
,
came
out
,
caught
sight
of
them
,
and
gave
*NL*
a
sharp
bark
.
They
separated
with
a
start
--
one
hurried
through
the
gate
*NL*
out
of
the
Grove
,
and
the
other
,
turning
round
,
walked
slowly
,
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
saunter
,
towards
Adam
who
still
stood
transfixed
and
pale
,
*NL*
clutching
tighter
the
stick
with
which
he
held
the
basket
of
tools
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
and
looking
at
the
approaching
figure
with
eyes
in
which
*NL*
amazement
was
fast
turning
to
fierceness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
Donnithorne
looked
flushed
and
excited
;
he
had
tried
to
make
*NL*
unpleasant
feelings
more
bearable
by
drinking
a
little
more
wine
than
*NL*
usual
at
dinner
to-day
,
and
was
still
enough
under
its
flattering
*NL*
influence
to
think
more
lightly
of
this
unwished-for
rencontre
with
Adam
*NL*
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
.
After
all
,
Adam
was
the
best
person
*NL*
who
could
have
happened
to
see
him
and
Hetty
together
--
he
was
a
sensible
*NL*
fellow
,
and
would
not
babble
about
it
to
other
people
.
Arthur
felt
*NL*
confident
that
he
could
laugh
the
thing
off
and
explain
it
away
.
And
so
*NL*
he
sauntered
forward
with
elaborate
carelessness
--
his
flushed
face
,
his
*NL*
evening
dress
of
fine
cloth
and
fine
linen
,
his
hands
half-thrust
into
*NL*
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
all
shone
upon
by
the
strange
evening
light
which
*NL*
the
light
clouds
had
caught
up
even
to
the
zenith
,
and
were
now
shedding
*NL*
down
between
the
topmost
branches
above
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
still
motionless
,
looking
at
him
as
he
came
up
.
He
understood
*NL*
it
all
now
--
the
locket
and
everything
else
that
had
been
doubtful
to
*NL*
him
:
a
terrible
scorching
light
showed
him
the
hidden
letters
that
*NL*
changed
the
meaning
of
the
past
.
If
he
had
moved
a
muscle
,
he
must
*NL*
inevitably
have
sprung
upon
Arthur
like
a
tiger
;
and
in
the
conflicting
*NL*
emotions
that
filled
those
long
moments
,
he
had
told
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
not
give
loose
to
passion
,
he
would
only
speak
the
right
thing
.
*NL*
He
stood
as
if
petrified
by
an
unseen
force
,
but
the
force
was
his
own
*NL*
strong
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Adam
,
''
said
Arthur
,
``
you
've
been
looking
at
the
fine
old
beeches
,
*NL*
eh
?
They
're
not
to
be
come
near
by
the
hatchet
,
though
;
this
is
a
sacred
*NL*
grove
.
I
overtook
pretty
little
Hetty
Sorrel
as
I
was
coming
to
my
*NL*
den
--
the
Hermitage
,
there
.
She
ought
not
to
come
home
this
way
so
late
.
*NL*
So
I
took
care
of
her
to
the
gate
,
and
asked
for
a
kiss
for
my
pains
.
*NL*
But
I
must
get
back
now
,
for
this
road
is
confoundedly
damp
.
Good-night
,
*NL*
Adam
.
I
shall
see
you
to-morrow
--
to
say
good-bye
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
too
much
preoccupied
with
the
part
he
was
playing
himself
to
*NL*
be
thoroughly
aware
of
the
expression
in
Adam
's
face
.
He
did
not
look
*NL*
directly
at
Adam
,
but
glanced
carelessly
round
at
the
trees
and
then
*NL*
lifted
up
one
foot
to
look
at
the
sole
of
his
boot
.
He
cared
to
say
no
*NL*
more
--
he
had
thrown
quite
dust
enough
into
honest
Adam
's
eyes
--
and
as
he
*NL*
spoke
the
last
words
,
he
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
bit
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
in
a
hard
peremptory
voice
,
without
*NL*
turning
round
.
``
I
've
got
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
paused
in
surprise
.
Susceptible
persons
are
more
affected
by
*NL*
a
change
of
tone
than
by
unexpected
words
,
and
Arthur
had
the
*NL*
susceptibility
of
a
nature
at
once
affectionate
and
vain
.
He
was
still
*NL*
more
surprised
when
he
saw
that
Adam
had
not
moved
,
but
stood
with
his
*NL*
back
to
him
,
as
if
summoning
him
to
return
.
What
did
he
mean
?
He
was
*NL*
going
to
make
a
serious
business
of
this
affair
.
Arthur
felt
his
temper
*NL*
rising
.
A
patronising
disposition
always
has
its
meaner
side
,
and
in
the
*NL*
confusion
of
his
irritation
and
alarm
there
entered
the
feeling
that
a
*NL*
man
to
whom
he
had
shown
so
much
favour
as
to
Adam
was
not
in
a
position
*NL*
to
criticize
his
conduct
.
And
yet
he
was
dominated
,
as
one
who
feels
*NL*
himself
in
the
wrong
always
is
,
by
the
man
whose
good
opinion
he
cares
*NL*
for
.
In
spite
of
pride
and
temper
,
there
was
as
much
deprecation
as
*NL*
anger
in
his
voice
when
he
said
,
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Adam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
sir
''
--
answered
Adam
,
in
the
same
harsh
voice
,
still
without
*NL*
turning
round
--
``
I
mean
,
sir
,
that
you
do
n't
deceive
me
by
your
light
*NL*
words
.
This
is
not
the
first
time
you
've
met
Hetty
Sorrel
in
this
grove
,
*NL*
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
you
've
kissed
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
felt
a
startled
uncertainty
how
far
Adam
was
speaking
from
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
how
far
from
mere
inference
.
And
this
uncertainty
,
*NL*
which
prevented
him
from
contriving
a
prudent
answer
,
heightened
his
*NL*
irritation
.
He
said
,
in
a
high
sharp
tone
,
``
Well
,
sir
,
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
instead
of
acting
like
th
'
upright
,
honourable
man
we
've
*NL*
all
believed
you
to
be
,
you
've
been
acting
the
part
of
a
selfish
*NL*
light-minded
scoundrel
.
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
what
it
's
to
lead
to
*NL*
when
a
gentleman
like
you
kisses
and
makes
love
to
a
young
woman
like
*NL*
Hetty
,
and
gives
her
presents
as
she
's
frightened
for
other
folks
*NL*
to
see
.
And
I
say
it
again
,
you
're
acting
the
part
of
a
selfish
*NL*
light-minded
scoundrel
though
it
cuts
me
to
th
'
heart
to
say
so
,
and
I
'd
*NL*
rather
ha
'
lost
my
right
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
tell
you
,
Adam
,
''
said
Arthur
,
bridling
his
growing
anger
and
*NL*
trying
to
recur
to
his
careless
tone
,
``
you
're
not
only
devilishly
*NL*
impertinent
,
but
you
're
talking
nonsense
.
Every
pretty
girl
is
not
such
*NL*
a
fool
as
you
,
to
suppose
that
when
a
gentleman
admires
her
beauty
and
*NL*
pays
her
a
little
attention
,
he
must
mean
something
particular
.
Every
*NL*
man
likes
to
flirt
with
a
pretty
girl
,
and
every
pretty
girl
likes
to
be
*NL*
flirted
with
.
The
wider
the
distance
between
them
,
the
less
harm
there
*NL*
is
,
for
then
she
's
not
likely
to
deceive
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
flirting
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
but
if
you
mean
*NL*
behaving
to
a
woman
as
if
you
loved
her
,
and
yet
not
loving
her
all
*NL*
the
while
,
I
say
that
's
not
th
'
action
of
an
honest
man
,
and
what
is
n't
*NL*
honest
does
come
t
'
harm
.
I
'm
not
a
fool
,
and
you
're
not
a
fool
,
and
you
*NL*
know
better
than
what
you
're
saying
.
You
know
it
could
n't
be
made
*NL*
public
as
you
've
behaved
to
Hetty
as
y
'
have
done
without
her
losing
her
*NL*
character
and
bringing
shame
and
trouble
on
her
and
her
relations
.
What
*NL*
if
you
meant
nothing
by
your
kissing
and
your
presents
?
Other
folks
*NL*
wo
n't
believe
as
you
've
meant
nothing
;
and
do
n't
tell
me
about
her
not
*NL*
deceiving
herself

I
tell
you
as
you
've
filled
her
mind
so
with
the
*NL*
thought
of
you
as
it
'll
mayhap
poison
her
life
,
and
she
'll
never
love
*NL*
another
man
as
`
ud
make
her
a
good
husband

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
had
felt
a
sudden
relief
while
Adam
was
speaking
;
he
perceived
*NL*
that
Adam
had
no
positive
knowledge
of
the
past
,
and
that
there
was
no
*NL*
irrevocable
damage
done
by
this
evening
's
unfortunate
rencontre
.
Adam
*NL*
could
still
be
deceived
.
The
candid
Arthur
had
brought
himself
into
a
*NL*
position
in
which
successful
lying
was
his
only
hope
.
The
hope
allayed
*NL*
his
anger
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Adam
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
friendly
concession
,
``
you
're
perhaps
*NL*
right
.
Perhaps
I
've
gone
a
little
too
far
in
taking
notice
of
the
pretty
*NL*
little
thing
and
stealing
a
kiss
now
and
then
.
You
're
such
a
grave
,
*NL*
steady
fellow
,
you
do
n't
understand
the
temptation
to
such
trifling
.
*NL*
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
bring
any
trouble
or
annoyance
on
her
and
the
good
*NL*
Poysers
on
any
account
if
I
could
help
it
.
But
I
think
you
look
a
little
*NL*
too
seriously
at
it
.
You
know
I
'm
going
away
immediately
,
so
I
sha
n't
*NL*
make
any
more
mistakes
of
the
kind
.
But
let
us
say
good-night
''
--
Arthur
*NL*
here
turned
round
to
walk
on
--
``
and
talk
no
more
about
the
matter
.
The
*NL*
whole
thing
will
soon
be
forgotten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
God
!
''
Adam
burst
out
with
rage
that
could
be
controlled
no
*NL*
longer
,
throwing
down
the
basket
of
tools
and
striding
forward
till
he
*NL*
was
right
in
front
of
Arthur
.
All
his
jealousy
and
sense
of
personal
*NL*
injury
,
which
he
had
been
hitherto
trying
to
keep
under
,
had
leaped
up
*NL*
and
mastered
him
.
What
man
of
us
,
in
the
first
moments
of
a
sharp
*NL*
agony
,
could
ever
feel
that
the
fellow-man
who
has
been
the
medium
of
*NL*
inflicting
it
did
not
mean
to
hurt
us
?
In
our
instinctive
rebellion
*NL*
against
pain
,
we
are
children
again
,
and
demand
an
active
will
to
wreak
*NL*
our
vengeance
on
.
Adam
at
this
moment
could
only
feel
that
he
had
*NL*
been
robbed
of
Hetty
--
robbed
treacherously
by
the
man
in
whom
he
had
*NL*
trusted
--
and
he
stood
close
in
front
of
Arthur
,
with
fierce
eyes
glaring
*NL*
at
him
,
with
pale
lips
and
clenched
hands
,
the
hard
tones
in
which
he
*NL*
had
hitherto
been
constraining
himself
to
express
no
more
than
a
just
*NL*
indignation
giving
way
to
a
deep
agitated
voice
that
seemed
to
shake
him
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
'll
not
be
soon
forgot
,
as
you
've
come
in
between
her
and
me
,
*NL*
when
she
might
ha

loved
me
--
it
'll
not
soon
be
forgot
as
you
've
robbed
*NL*
me
o

my
happiness
,
while
I
thought
you
was
my
best
friend

and
a

noble-minded
man

as
I
was
proud
to
work
for

her

I
never
kissed
her
i

my

worked
hard
for
years
for
the

you
make
light
of
it

more

rather
you

act
as
my
enemy

all

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Adam
,
possessed
by
rage
that
could
find
no
other
vent
,
began
to
*NL*
throw
off
his
coat
and
his
cap
,
too
blind
with
passion
to
notice
the
*NL*
change
that
had
taken
place
in
Arthur
while
he
was
speaking
.
Arthur
's
*NL*
lips
were
now
as
pale
as
Adam
's
;
his
heart
was
beating
violently
.
The
*NL*
discovery
that
Adam
loved
Hetty
was
a
shock
which
made
him
for
the
*NL*
moment
see
himself
in
the
light
of
Adam
's
indignation
,
and
regard
Adam
's
*NL*
suffering
as
not
merely
a
consequence
,
but
an
element
of
his
error
.
*NL*
The
words
of
hatred
and
contempt
--
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
*NL*
life
--
seemed
like
scorching
missiles
that
were
making
ineffaceable
scars
*NL*
on
him
.
All
screening
self-excuse
,
which
rarely
falls
quite
away
while
*NL*
others
respect
us
,
forsook
him
for
an
instant
,
and
he
stood
face
to
face
*NL*
with
the
first
great
irrevocable
evil
he
had
ever
committed
.
He
was
*NL*
only
twenty-one
,
and
three
months
ago
--
nay
,
much
later
--
he
had
thought
*NL*
proudly
that
no
man
should
ever
be
able
to
reproach
him
justly
.
His
*NL*
first
impulse
,
if
there
had
been
time
for
it
,
would
perhaps
have
been
to
*NL*
utter
words
of
propitiation
;
but
Adam
had
no
sooner
thrown
off
his
*NL*
coat
and
cap
than
he
became
aware
that
Arthur
was
standing
pale
and
*NL*
motionless
,
with
his
hands
still
thrust
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
said
,
``
wo
n't
you
fight
me
like
a
man
?
You
know
I
wo
n't
strike
*NL*
you
while
you
stand
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Adam
,
''
said
Arthur
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
fight
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Adam
,
bitterly
;
``
you
do
n't
want
to
fight
me
--
you
think
I
'm
a
*NL*
common
man
,
as
you
can
injure
without
answering
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
meant
to
injure
you
,
''
said
Arthur
,
with
returning
anger
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
you
loved
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
made
her
love
you
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
You
're
a
double-faced
*NL*
man
--
I
'll
never
believe
a
word
you
say
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
I
tell
you
,
''
said
Arthur
,
angrily
,
``
or
we
shall
both
repent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Adam
,
with
a
convulsed
voice
,
``
I
swear
I
wo
n't
go
away
*NL*
without
fighting
you
.
Do
you
want
provoking
any
more
?
I
tell
you
you
're
*NL*
a
coward
and
a
scoundrel
,
and
I
despise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
had
all
rushed
back
to
Arthur
's
face
;
in
a
moment
his
right
*NL*
hand
was
clenched
,
and
dealt
a
blow
like
lightning
,
which
sent
Adam
*NL*
staggering
backward
.
His
blood
was
as
thoroughly
up
as
Adam
's
now
,
and
*NL*
the
two
men
,
forgetting
the
emotions
that
had
gone
before
,
fought
*NL*
with
the
instinctive
fierceness
of
panthers
in
the
deepening
twilight
*NL*
darkened
by
the
trees
.
The
delicate-handed
gentleman
was
a
match
for
the
*NL*
workman
in
everything
but
strength
,
and
Arthur
's
skill
enabled
him
to
*NL*
protract
the
struggle
for
some
long
moments
.
But
between
unarmed
men
the
*NL*
battle
is
to
the
strong
,
where
the
strong
is
no
blunderer
,
and
Arthur
*NL*
must
sink
under
a
well-planted
blow
of
Adam
's
as
a
steel
rod
is
broken
*NL*
by
an
iron
bar
.
The
blow
soon
came
,
and
Arthur
fell
,
his
head
lying
*NL*
concealed
in
a
tuft
of
fern
,
so
that
Adam
could
only
discern
his
darkly
*NL*
clad
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
waiting
for
Arthur
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blow
had
been
given
now
,
towards
which
he
had
been
straining
all
the
*NL*
force
of
nerve
and
muscle
--
and
what
was
the
good
of
it
?
What
had
he
*NL*
done
by
fighting
?
Only
satisfied
his
own
passion
,
only
wreaked
his
own
*NL*
vengeance
.
He
had
not
rescued
Hetty
,
nor
changed
the
past
--
there
it
was
,
*NL*
just
as
it
had
been
,
and
he
sickened
at
the
vanity
of
his
own
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
did
not
Arthur
rise
?
He
was
perfectly
motionless
,
and
the
time
*NL*
seemed
long
to
Adam
.
Good
God
!
had
the
blow
been
too
much
for
him
?
Adam
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
his
own
strength
,
as
with
the
oncoming
of
*NL*
this
dread
he
knelt
down
by
Arthur
's
side
and
lifted
his
head
from
among
*NL*
the
fern
.
There
was
no
sign
of
life
:
the
eyes
and
teeth
were
set
.
The
*NL*
horror
that
rushed
over
Adam
completely
mastered
him
,
and
forced
upon
*NL*
him
its
own
belief
.
He
could
feel
nothing
but
that
death
was
in
Arthur
's
*NL*
face
,
and
that
he
was
helpless
before
it
.
He
made
not
a
single
movement
,
*NL*
but
knelt
like
an
image
of
despair
gazing
at
an
image
of
death
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
Dilemma
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
only
a
few
minutes
measured
by
the
clock
--
though
Adam
always
*NL*
thought
it
had
been
a
long
while
--
before
he
perceived
a
gleam
of
*NL*
consciousness
in
Arthur
's
face
and
a
slight
shiver
through
his
frame
.
*NL*
The
intense
joy
that
flooded
his
soul
brought
back
some
of
the
old
*NL*
affection
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
any
pain
,
sir
?
''
he
said
,
tenderly
,
loosening
Arthur
's
*NL*
cravat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
turned
his
eyes
on
Adam
with
a
vague
stare
which
gave
way
to
a
*NL*
slightly
startled
motion
as
if
from
the
shock
of
returning
memory
.
But
*NL*
he
only
shivered
again
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
any
hurt
,
sir
?
''
Adam
said
again
,
with
a
trembling
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
put
his
hand
up
to
his
waistcoat
buttons
,
and
when
Adam
had
*NL*
unbuttoned
it
,
he
took
a
longer
breath
.
``
Lay
my
head
down
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
faintly
,
``
and
get
me
some
water
if
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
laid
the
head
down
gently
on
the
fern
again
,
and
emptying
the
tools
*NL*
out
of
the
flag-basket
,
hurried
through
the
trees
to
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
Grove
bordering
on
the
Chase
,
where
a
brook
ran
below
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
with
his
basket
leaking
,
but
still
half-full
,
Arthur
*NL*
looked
at
him
with
a
more
thoroughly
reawakened
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
drink
a
drop
out
o
'
your
hand
,
sir
?
''
said
Adam
,
kneeling
down
*NL*
again
to
lift
up
Arthur
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Arthur
,
``
dip
my
cravat
in
and
souse
it
on
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
seemed
to
do
him
some
good
,
for
he
presently
raised
himself
a
*NL*
little
higher
,
resting
on
Adam
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
any
hurt
inside
sir
?
''
Adam
asked
again
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
hurt
,
''
said
Arthur
,
still
faintly
,
``
but
rather
done
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
he
said
,
``
I
suppose
I
fainted
away
when
you
knocked
me
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
thank
God
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
I
thought
it
was
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
You
thought
you
'd
done
for
me
,
eh
?
Come
help
me
on
my
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
terribly
shaky
and
dizzy
,
''
Arthur
said
,
as
he
stood
leaning
*NL*
on
Adam
's
arm
;
``
that
blow
of
yours
must
have
come
against
me
like
a
*NL*
battering-ram
.
I
do
n't
believe
I
can
walk
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lean
on
me
,
sir
;
I
'll
get
you
along
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
Or
,
will
you
sit
down
*NL*
a
bit
longer
,
on
my
coat
here
,
and
I
'll
prop
y
'
up
.
You
'll
perhaps
be
*NL*
better
in
a
minute
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Arthur
.
``
I
'll
go
to
the
Hermitage
--
I
think
I
've
got
some
*NL*
brandy
there
.
There
's
a
short
road
to
it
a
little
farther
on
,
near
the
*NL*
gate
.
If
you
'll
just
help
me
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
slowly
,
with
frequent
pauses
,
but
without
speaking
again
.
*NL*
In
both
of
them
,
the
concentration
in
the
present
which
had
attended
*NL*
the
first
moments
of
Arthur
's
revival
had
now
given
way
to
a
vivid
*NL*
recollection
of
the
previous
scene
.
It
was
nearly
dark
in
the
narrow
*NL*
path
among
the
trees
,
but
within
the
circle
of
fir-trees
round
the
*NL*
Hermitage
there
was
room
for
the
growing
moonlight
to
enter
in
at
the
*NL*
windows
.
Their
steps
were
noiseless
on
the
thick
carpet
of
fir-needles
,
*NL*
and
the
outward
stillness
seemed
to
heighten
their
inward
consciousness
,
*NL*
as
Arthur
took
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
placed
it
in
Adam
's
hand
,
*NL*
for
him
to
open
the
door
.
Adam
had
not
known
before
that
Arthur
had
*NL*
furnished
the
old
Hermitage
and
made
it
a
retreat
for
himself
,
and
it
*NL*
was
a
surprise
to
him
when
he
opened
the
door
to
see
a
snug
room
with
*NL*
all
the
signs
of
frequent
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
loosed
Adam
's
arm
and
threw
himself
on
the
ottoman
.
``
You
'll
see
*NL*
my
hunting-bottle
somewhere
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
leather
case
with
a
bottle
and
*NL*
glass
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
not
long
in
finding
the
case
.
``
There
's
very
little
brandy
in
*NL*
it
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
turning
it
downwards
over
the
glass
,
as
he
held
it
*NL*
before
the
window
;
``
hardly
this
little
glassful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
give
me
that
,
''
said
Arthur
,
with
the
peevishness
of
physical
*NL*
depression
.
When
he
had
taken
some
sips
,
Adam
said
,
``
Had
n't
I
better
*NL*
run
to
th
'
house
,
sir
,
and
get
some
more
brandy
?
I
can
be
there
and
*NL*
back
pretty
soon
.
It
'll
be
a
stiff
walk
home
for
you
,
if
you
do
n't
have
*NL*
something
to
revive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
go
.
But
do
n't
say
I
'm
ill
.
Ask
for
my
man
Pym
,
and
tell
him
to
get
*NL*
it
from
Mills
,
and
not
to
say
I
'm
at
the
Hermitage
.
Get
some
water
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
relieved
to
have
an
active
task
--
both
of
them
were
relieved
to
*NL*
be
apart
from
each
other
for
a
short
time
.
But
Adam
's
swift
pace
could
*NL*
not
still
the
eager
pain
of
thinking
--
of
living
again
with
concentrated
*NL*
suffering
through
the
last
wretched
hour
,
and
looking
out
from
it
over
*NL*
all
the
new
sad
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
lay
still
for
some
minutes
after
Adam
was
gone
,
but
presently
*NL*
he
rose
feebly
from
the
ottoman
and
peered
about
slowly
in
the
broken
*NL*
moonlight
,
seeking
something
.
It
was
a
short
bit
of
wax
candle
that
*NL*
stood
amongst
a
confusion
of
writing
and
drawing
materials
.
There
was
*NL*
more
searching
for
the
means
of
lighting
the
candle
,
and
when
that
was
*NL*
done
,
he
went
cautiously
round
the
room
,
as
if
wishing
to
assure
himself
*NL*
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
something
.
At
last
he
had
found
a
slight
*NL*
thing
,
which
he
put
first
in
his
pocket
,
and
then
,
on
a
second
thought
,
*NL*
took
out
again
and
thrust
deep
down
into
a
waste-paper
basket
.
It
was
a
*NL*
woman
's
little
,
pink
,
silk
neckerchief
.
He
set
the
candle
on
the
table
,
*NL*
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
ottoman
again
,
exhausted
with
the
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Adam
came
back
with
his
supplies
,
his
entrance
awoke
Arthur
from
a
*NL*
doze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
Arthur
said
;
``
I
'm
tremendously
in
want
of
some
*NL*
brandy-vigour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
've
got
a
light
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
I
've
been
*NL*
thinking
I
'd
better
have
asked
for
a
lanthorn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
the
candle
will
last
long
enough
--
I
shall
soon
be
up
to
walking
*NL*
home
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
go
before
I
've
seen
you
safe
home
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
*NL*
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
stay
--
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
sat
down
,
and
they
remained
opposite
to
each
other
in
uneasy
*NL*
silence
,
while
Arthur
slowly
drank
brandy-and-water
,
with
visibly
*NL*
renovating
effect
.
He
began
to
lie
in
a
more
voluntary
position
,
and
*NL*
looked
as
if
he
were
less
overpowered
by
bodily
sensations
.
Adam
was
*NL*
keenly
alive
to
these
indications
,
and
as
his
anxiety
about
Arthur
's
*NL*
condition
began
to
be
allayed
,
he
felt
more
of
that
impatience
which
*NL*
every
one
knows
who
has
had
his
just
indignation
suspended
by
the
*NL*
physical
state
of
the
culprit
.
Yet
there
was
one
thing
on
his
mind
to
be
*NL*
done
before
he
could
recur
to
remonstrance
:
it
was
to
confess
what
had
*NL*
been
unjust
in
his
own
words
.
Perhaps
he
longed
all
the
more
to
make
*NL*
this
confession
,
that
his
indignation
might
be
free
again
;
and
as
he
saw
*NL*
the
signs
of
returning
ease
in
Arthur
,
the
words
again
and
again
came
to
*NL*
his
lips
and
went
back
,
checked
by
the
thought
that
it
would
be
better
*NL*
to
leave
everything
till
to-morrow
.
As
long
as
they
were
silent
they
did
*NL*
not
look
at
each
other
,
and
a
foreboding
came
across
Adam
that
if
they
*NL*
began
to
speak
as
though
they
remembered
the
past
--
if
they
looked
at
*NL*
each
other
with
full
recognition
--
they
must
take
fire
again
.
So
they
sat
*NL*
in
silence
till
the
bit
of
wax
candle
flickered
low
in
the
socket
,
the
*NL*
silence
all
the
while
becoming
more
irksome
to
Adam
.
Arthur
had
just
*NL*
poured
out
some
more
brandy-and-water
,
and
he
threw
one
arm
behind
his
*NL*
head
and
drew
up
one
leg
in
an
attitude
of
recovered
ease
,
which
was
an
*NL*
irresistible
temptation
to
Adam
to
speak
what
was
on
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
begin
to
feel
more
yourself
again
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
as
the
candle
*NL*
went
out
and
they
were
half-hidden
from
each
other
in
the
faint
*NL*
moonlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
I
do
n't
feel
good
for
much
--
very
lazy
,
and
not
inclined
to
move
;
*NL*
but
I
'll
go
home
when
I
've
taken
this
dose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
pause
before
Adam
said
,
``
My
temper
got
the
better
of
*NL*
me
,
and
I
said
things
as
was
n't
true
.
I
'd
no
right
to
speak
as
if
you
'd
*NL*
known
you
was
doing
me
an
injury
:
you
'd
no
grounds
for
knowing
it
;
I
've
*NL*
always
kept
what
I
felt
for
her
as
secret
as
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
again
before
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
perhaps
I
judged
you
too
harsh
--
I
'm
apt
to
be
harsh
--
and
you
may
*NL*
have
acted
out
o
'
thoughtlessness
more
than
I
should
ha
'
believed
was
*NL*
possible
for
a
man
with
a
heart
and
a
conscience
.
We
're
not
all
put
*NL*
together
alike
,
and
we
may
misjudge
one
another
.
God
knows
,
it
's
all
the
*NL*
joy
I
could
have
now
,
to
think
the
best
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
wanted
to
go
home
without
saying
any
more
--
he
was
too
painfully
*NL*
embarrassed
in
mind
,
as
well
as
too
weak
in
body
,
to
wish
for
any
*NL*
further
explanation
to-night
.
And
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
him
that
Adam
*NL*
reopened
the
subject
in
a
way
the
least
difficult
for
him
to
answer
.
*NL*
Arthur
was
in
the
wretched
position
of
an
open
,
generous
man
who
has
*NL*
committed
an
error
which
makes
deception
seem
a
necessity
.
The
native
*NL*
impulse
to
give
truth
in
return
for
truth
,
to
meet
trust
with
frank
*NL*
confession
,
must
be
suppressed
,
and
duty
was
becoming
a
question
of
*NL*
tactics
.
His
deed
was
reacting
upon
him
--
was
already
governing
him
*NL*
tyrannously
and
forcing
him
into
a
course
that
jarred
with
his
habitual
*NL*
feelings
.
The
only
aim
that
seemed
admissible
to
him
now
was
to
deceive
*NL*
Adam
to
the
utmost
:
to
make
Adam
think
better
of
him
than
he
deserved
.
*NL*
And
when
he
heard
the
words
of
honest
retractation
--
when
he
heard
the
*NL*
sad
appeal
with
which
Adam
ended
--
he
was
obliged
to
rejoice
in
*NL*
the
remains
of
ignorant
confidence
it
implied
.
He
did
not
answer
*NL*
immediately
,
for
he
had
to
be
judicious
and
not
truthful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
no
more
about
our
anger
,
Adam
,
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
very
languidly
,
*NL*
for
the
labour
of
speech
was
unwelcome
to
him
;
``
I
forgive
your
momentary
*NL*
injustice
--
it
was
quite
natural
,
with
the
exaggerated
notions
you
had
in
*NL*
your
mind
.
We
shall
be
none
the
worse
friends
in
future
,
I
hope
,
because
*NL*
we
've
fought
.
You
had
the
best
of
it
,
and
that
was
as
it
should
be
,
for
*NL*
I
believe
I
've
been
most
in
the
wrong
of
the
two
.
Come
,
let
us
shake
*NL*
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
held
out
his
hand
,
but
Adam
sat
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
say
`
No
'
to
that
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
ca
n't
shake
*NL*
hands
till
it
's
clear
what
we
mean
by
`
t.
I
was
wrong
when
I
spoke
as
*NL*
if
you
'd
done
me
an
injury
knowingly
,
but
I
was
n't
wrong
in
what
I
said
*NL*
before
,
about
your
behaviour
t
'
Hetty
,
and
I
ca
n't
shake
hands
with
you
*NL*
as
if
I
held
you
my
friend
the
same
as
ever
till
you
've
cleared
that
up
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
swallowed
his
pride
and
resentment
as
he
drew
back
his
hand
.
*NL*
He
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
,
as
indifferently
as
he
*NL*
could
,
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
clearing
up
,
Adam
.
I
've
told
you
*NL*
already
that
you
think
too
seriously
of
a
little
flirtation
.
But
if
*NL*
you
are
right
in
supposing
there
is
any
danger
in
it
--
I
'm
going
away
on
*NL*
Saturday
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
.
As
for
the
pain
it
has
given
*NL*
you
,
I
'm
heartily
sorry
for
it
.
I
can
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
said
nothing
,
but
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
with
his
face
*NL*
towards
one
of
the
windows
,
as
if
looking
at
the
blackness
of
the
*NL*
moonlit
fir-trees
;
but
he
was
in
reality
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
*NL*
conflict
within
him
.
It
was
of
no
use
now
--
his
resolution
not
to
speak
*NL*
till
to-morrow
.
He
must
speak
there
and
then
.
But
it
was
several
minutes
*NL*
before
he
turned
round
and
stepped
nearer
to
Arthur
,
standing
and
*NL*
looking
down
on
him
as
he
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
better
for
me
to
speak
plain
,
''
he
said
,
with
evident
effort
,
*NL*
``
though
it
's
hard
work
.
You
see
,
sir
,
this
is
n't
a
trifle
to
me
,
*NL*
whatever
it
may
be
to
you
.
I
'm
none
o
'
them
men
as
can
go
making
love
*NL*
first
to
one
woman
and
then
t
'
another
,
and
do
n't
think
it
much
odds
*NL*
which
of
'em
I
take
.
What
I
feel
for
Hetty
's
a
different
sort
o
'
love
,
*NL*
such
as
I
believe
nobody
can
know
much
about
but
them
as
feel
it
and
God
*NL*
as
has
given
it
to
'em
.
She
's
more
nor
everything
else
to
me
,
all
but
*NL*
my
conscience
and
my
good
name
.
And
if
it
's
true
what
you
've
been
saying
*NL*
all
along
--
and
if
it
's
only
been
trifling
and
flirting
as
you
call
it
,
*NL*
as
'll
be
put
an
end
to
by
your
going
away
--
why
,
then
,
I
'd
wait
,
and
*NL*
hope
her
heart
`
ud
turn
to
me
after
all
.
I
'm
loath
to
think
you
'd
speak
*NL*
false
to
me
,
and
I
'll
believe
your
word
,
however
things
may
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
be
wronging
Hetty
more
than
me
not
to
believe
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Arthur
,
almost
violently
,
starting
up
from
the
ottoman
and
moving
away
.
*NL*
But
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
again
directly
,
saying
,
more
feebly
,
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
forget
that
,
in
suspecting
me
,
you
are
casting
imputations
*NL*
upon
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
Adam
said
,
in
a
calmer
voice
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
half-relieved
--
for
he
was
too
straightforward
to
make
a
distinction
*NL*
between
a
direct
falsehood
and
an
indirect
one
--
``
Nay
,
sir
,
things
do
n't
*NL*
lie
level
between
Hetty
and
you
.
You
're
acting
with
your
eyes
open
,
*NL*
whatever
you
may
do
;
but
how
do
you
know
what
's
been
in
her
mind
?
She
's
*NL*
all
but
a
child
--
as
any
man
with
a
conscience
in
him
ought
to
feel
bound
*NL*
to
take
care
on
.
And
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
know
you
've
disturbed
*NL*
her
mind
.
I
know
she
's
been
fixing
her
heart
on
you
,
for
there
's
a
many
*NL*
things
clear
to
me
now
as
I
did
n't
understand
before
.
But
you
seem
to
*NL*
make
light
o
'
what
she
may
feel
--
you
do
n't
think
o
'
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Adam
,
let
me
alone
!
''
Arthur
burst
out
impetuously
;
``
I
feel
it
*NL*
enough
without
your
worrying
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aware
of
his
indiscretion
as
soon
as
the
words
had
escaped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
you
feel
it
,
''
Adam
rejoined
,
eagerly
;
``
if
you
feel
as
*NL*
you
may
ha
'
put
false
notions
into
her
mind
,
and
made
her
believe
as
*NL*
you
loved
her
,
when
all
the
while
you
meant
nothing
,
I
've
this
demand
*NL*
to
make
of
you
--
I
'm
not
speaking
for
myself
,
but
for
her
.
I
ask
you
t
'
*NL*
undeceive
her
before
you
go
away
.
Y'
are
n't
going
away
for
ever
,
and
if
*NL*
you
leave
her
behind
with
a
notion
in
her
head
o
'
your
feeling
about
her
*NL*
the
same
as
she
feels
about
you
,
she
'll
be
hankering
after
you
,
and
the
*NL*
mischief
may
get
worse
.
It
may
be
a
smart
to
her
now
,
but
it
'll
save
her
*NL*
pain
i

th

end
.
I
ask
you
to
write
a
letter
--
you
may
trust
to
my
seeing
*NL*
as
she
gets
it
.
Tell
her
the
truth
,
and
take
blame
to
yourself
for
*NL*
behaving
as
you
'd
no
right
to
do
to
a
young
woman
as
is
n't
your
equal
.
*NL*
I
speak
plain
,
sir
,
but
I
ca
n't
speak
any
other
way
.
There
's
nobody
can
*NL*
take
care
o

Hetty
in
this
thing
but
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
what
I
think
needful
in
the
matter
,
''
said
Arthur
,
more
and
*NL*
more
irritated
by
mingled
distress
and
perplexity
,
``
without
giving
*NL*
promises
to
you
.
I
shall
take
what
measures
I
think
proper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Adam
,
in
an
abrupt
decided
tone
,
``
that
wo
n't
do

I
must
know
*NL*
what
ground
I

treading
on

safe
as
you
've
put
an
end
to
what
*NL*
ought
never

I
do
n't
forget
what
's
owing
to
you
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
but
in
this
thing
we
're
man
and
man
,
and
I
ca
n't
give
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
for
some
moments
.
Then
Arthur
said
,
``
I
'll
see
you
*NL*
to-morrow
.
I
can
bear
no
more
now
;
I
'm
ill

''
He
rose
as
he
spoke
,
and
*NL*
reached
his
cap
,
as
if
intending
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
see
her
again
!
''
Adam
exclaimed
,
with
a
flash
of
recurring
*NL*
anger
and
suspicion
,
moving
towards
the
door
and
placing
his
back
*NL*
against
it
.
``
Either
tell
me
she
can
never
be
my
wife

tell
me
you
've
*NL*
been
lying
--
or
else
promise
me
what
I
've
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
uttering
this
alternative
,
stood
like
a
terrible
fate
before
*NL*
Arthur
,
who
had
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
,
and
now
stopped
,
faint
,
*NL*
shaken
,
sick
in
mind
and
body
.
It
seemed
long
to
both
of
them
--
that
*NL*
inward
struggle
of
Arthur
's
--
before
he
said
,
feebly
,
``
I
promise
;
let
me
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
moved
away
from
the
door
and
opened
it
,
but
when
Arthur
reached
the
*NL*
step
,
he
stopped
again
and
leaned
against
the
door-post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
well
enough
to
walk
alone
,
sir

''
said
Adam
.
``
Take
my
arm
*NL*
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
made
no
answer
,
and
presently
walked
on
,
Adam
following
.
But
,
*NL*
after
a
few
steps
,
he
stood
still
again
,
and
said
,
coldly
,
``
I
believe
I
*NL*
must
trouble
you

It
's
getting
late
now
,
and
there
may
be
an
alarm
set
*NL*
up
about
me
at
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
gave
his
arm
,
and
they
walked
on
without
uttering
a
word
,
till
they
*NL*
came
where
the
basket
and
the
tools
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
pick
up
the
tools

Adam
said
.
``
They
're
my

I
*NL*

they
'll
be
rusted

If
you
'll
please

wait
a
minute

*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
stood
still
without
speaking
,
and
no
other
word
passed
between
*NL*
them
till
they
were
at
the
side
entrance
,
where
he
hoped
to
get
in
*NL*
without
being
seen
by
any
one
.
He
said
then
,
``
Thank
you
;
I
need
n't
*NL*
trouble
you
any
further
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
will
it
be

`

said
*NL*
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
send
me
word
that
you
're
here
at
five
o'clock

said
Arthur
;
*NL*
``
not
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

said
Adam
.
But
he
heard
no

Arthur
had
turned
*NL*
into
the
house

Chapter

The
Next
Morning
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ARTHUR
did
not
pass
a
sleepless
night
;
he
slept
long
and
well
.
For
sleep
*NL*
comes
to
the
perplexed
--
if
the
perplexed
are
only
weary
enough
.
But
at
*NL*
seven
he
rang
his
bell
and
astonished
Pym
by
declaring
he
was
going
to
*NL*
get
up
,
and
must
have
breakfast
brought
to
him
at
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
see
that
my
mare
is
saddled
at
half-past
eight
,
and
tell
my
*NL*
grandfather
when
he
's
down
that
I
'm
better
this
morning
and
am
gone
for
*NL*
a
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
awake
an
hour
,
and
could
rest
in
bed
no
longer
.
In
bed
our
*NL*
yesterdays
are
too
oppressive
:
if
a
man
can
only
get
up
,
though
it
*NL*
be
but
to
whistle
or
to
smoke
,
he
has
a
present
which
offers
some
*NL*
resistance
to
the
past
--
sensations
which
assert
themselves
against
*NL*
tyrannous
memories
.
And
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
taking
averages
*NL*
of
feeling
,
it
would
certainly
be
found
that
in
the
hunting
and
shooting
*NL*
seasons
regret
,
self-reproach
,
and
mortified
pride
weigh
lighter
on
*NL*
country
gentlemen
than
in
late
spring
and
summer
.
Arthur
felt
that
he
*NL*
should
be
more
of
a
man
on
horseback
.
Even
the
presence
of
Pym
,
waiting
*NL*
on
him
with
the
usual
deference
,
was
a
reassurance
to
him
after
the
*NL*
scenes
of
yesterday
.
For
,
with
Arthur
's
sensitiveness
to
opinion
,
*NL*
the
loss
of
Adam
's
respect
was
a
shock
to
his
self-contentment
which
*NL*
suffused
his
imagination
with
the
sense
that
he
had
sunk
in
all
eyes
--
as
*NL*
a
sudden
shock
of
fear
from
some
real
peril
makes
a
nervous
woman
afraid
*NL*
even
to
step
,
because
all
her
perceptions
are
suffused
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
,
as
you
know
,
was
a
loving
nature
.
Deeds
of
kindness
were
as
*NL*
easy
to
him
as
a
bad
habit
:
they
were
the
common
issue
of
his
weaknesses
*NL*
and
good
qualities
,
of
his
egoism
and
his
sympathy
.
He
did
n't
like
to
*NL*
witness
pain
,
and
he
liked
to
have
grateful
eyes
beaming
on
him
as
the
*NL*
giver
of
pleasure
.
When
he
was
a
lad
of
seven
,
he
one
day
kicked
down
an
*NL*
old
gardener
's
pitcher
of
broth
,
from
no
motive
but
a
kicking
impulse
,
*NL*
not
reflecting
that
it
was
the
old
man
's
dinner
;
but
on
learning
that
*NL*
sad
fact
,
he
took
his
favourite
pencil-case
and
a
silver-hafted
knife
*NL*
out
of
his
pocket
and
offered
them
as
compensation
.
He
had
been
the
same
*NL*
Arthur
ever
since
,
trying
to
make
all
offences
forgotten
in
benefits
.
*NL*
If
there
were
any
bitterness
in
his
nature
,
it
could
only
show
itself
*NL*
against
the
man
who
refused
to
be
conciliated
by
him
.
And
perhaps
the
*NL*
time
was
come
for
some
of
that
bitterness
to
rise
.
At
the
first
moment
,
*NL*
Arthur
had
felt
pure
distress
and
self-reproach
at
discovering
that
*NL*
Adam
's
happiness
was
involved
in
his
relation
to
Hetty
.
If
there
had
*NL*
been
a
possibility
of
making
Adam
tenfold
amends
--
if
deeds
of
gift
,
or
*NL*
any
other
deeds
,
could
have
restored
Adam
's
contentment
and
regard
for
*NL*
him
as
a
benefactor
,
Arthur
would
not
only
have
executed
them
without
*NL*
hesitation
,
but
would
have
felt
bound
all
the
more
closely
to
Adam
,
*NL*
and
would
never
have
been
weary
of
making
retribution
.
But
Adam
could
*NL*
receive
no
amends
;
his
suffering
could
not
be
cancelled
;
his
respect
and
*NL*
affection
could
not
be
recovered
by
any
prompt
deeds
of
atonement
.
He
*NL*
stood
like
an
immovable
obstacle
against
which
no
pressure
could
*NL*
avail
;
an
embodiment
of
what
Arthur
most
shrank
from
believing
in
--
the
*NL*
irrevocableness
of
his
own
wrongdoing
.
The
words
of
scorn
,
the
refusal
*NL*
to
shake
hands
,
the
mastery
asserted
over
him
in
their
last
conversation
*NL*
in
the
Hermitage
--
above
all
,
the
sense
of
having
been
knocked
down
,
to
*NL*
which
a
man
does
not
very
well
reconcile
himself
,
even
under
the
most
*NL*
heroic
circumstances
--
pressed
on
him
with
a
galling
pain
which
was
*NL*
stronger
than
compunction
.
Arthur
would
so
gladly
have
persuaded
himself
*NL*
that
he
had
done
no
harm
!
And
if
no
one
had
told
him
the
contrary
,
he
*NL*
could
have
persuaded
himself
so
much
better
.
Nemesis
can
seldom
forge
a
*NL*
sword
for
herself
out
of
our
consciences
--
out
of
the
suffering
we
feel
*NL*
in
the
suffering
we
may
have
caused
:
there
is
rarely
metal
enough
there
*NL*
to
make
an
effective
weapon
.
Our
moral
sense
learns
the
manners
of
good
*NL*
society
and
smiles
when
others
smile
,
but
when
some
rude
person
gives
*NL*
rough
names
to
our
actions
,
she
is
apt
to
take
part
against
us
.
And
*NL*
so
it
was
with
Arthur
:
Adam
's
judgment
of
him
,
Adam
's
grating
words
,
*NL*
disturbed
his
self-soothing
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
Arthur
had
been
at
ease
before
Adam
's
discovery
.
Struggles
and
*NL*
resolves
had
transformed
themselves
into
compunction
and
anxiety
.
He
was
*NL*
distressed
for
Hetty
's
sake
,
and
distressed
for
his
own
,
that
he
*NL*
must
leave
her
behind
.
He
had
always
,
both
in
making
and
breaking
*NL*
resolutions
,
looked
beyond
his
passion
and
seen
that
it
must
speedily
*NL*
end
in
separation
;
but
his
nature
was
too
ardent
and
tender
for
him
not
*NL*
to
suffer
at
this
parting
;
and
on
Hetty
's
account
he
was
filled
with
*NL*
uneasiness
.
He
had
found
out
the
dream
in
which
she
was
living
--
that
she
*NL*
was
to
be
a
lady
in
silks
and
satins
--
and
when
he
had
first
talked
to
*NL*
her
about
his
going
away
,
she
had
asked
him
tremblingly
to
let
her
go
*NL*
with
him
and
be
married
.
It
was
his
painful
knowledge
of
this
which
had
*NL*
given
the
most
exasperating
sting
to
Adam
's
reproaches
.
He
had
said
no
*NL*
word
with
the
purpose
of
deceiving
her
--
her
vision
was
all
spun
by
her
*NL*
own
childish
fancy
--
but
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
it
was
*NL*
spun
half
out
of
his
own
actions
.
And
to
increase
the
mischief
,
on
this
*NL*
last
evening
he
had
not
dared
to
hint
the
truth
to
Hetty
;
he
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
soothe
her
with
tender
,
hopeful
words
,
lest
he
should
throw
*NL*
her
into
violent
distress
.
He
felt
the
situation
acutely
,
felt
the
*NL*
sorrow
of
the
dear
thing
in
the
present
,
and
thought
with
a
darker
*NL*
anxiety
of
the
tenacity
which
her
feelings
might
have
in
the
future
.
*NL*
That
was
the
one
sharp
point
which
pressed
against
him
;
every
other
he
*NL*
could
evade
by
hopeful
self-persuasion
.
The
whole
thing
had
been
secret
;
*NL*
the
Poysers
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
.
No
one
,
except
Adam
,
knew
*NL*
anything
of
what
had
passed
--
no
one
else
was
likely
to
know
;
for
Arthur
*NL*
had
impressed
on
Hetty
that
it
would
be
fatal
to
betray
,
by
word
or
*NL*
look
,
that
there
had
been
the
least
intimacy
between
them
;
and
Adam
,
who
*NL*
knew
half
their
secret
,
would
rather
help
them
to
keep
it
than
betray
*NL*
it
.
It
was
an
unfortunate
business
altogether
,
but
there
was
no
use
in
*NL*
making
it
worse
than
it
was
by
imaginary
exaggerations
and
forebodings
*NL*
of
evil
that
might
never
come
.
The
temporary
sadness
for
Hetty
was
*NL*
the
worst
consequence
;
he
resolutely
turned
away
his
eyes
from
any
bad
*NL*
consequence
that
was
not
demonstrably
inevitable
.
But
--
but
Hetty
might
*NL*
have
had
the
trouble
in
some
other
way
if
not
in
this
.
And
perhaps
*NL*
hereafter
he
might
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
for
her
and
make
up
to
her
*NL*
for
all
the
tears
she
would
shed
about
him
.
She
would
owe
the
advantage
*NL*
of
his
care
for
her
in
future
years
to
the
sorrow
she
had
incurred
now
.
*NL*
So
good
comes
out
of
evil
.
Such
is
the
beautiful
arrangement
of
things
!
*NL*
*NL*
Are
you
inclined
to
ask
whether
this
can
be
the
same
Arthur
who
,
two
*NL*
months
ago
,
had
that
freshness
of
feeling
,
that
delicate
honour
which
*NL*
shrinks
from
wounding
even
a
sentiment
,
and
does
not
contemplate
any
*NL*
more
positive
offence
as
possible
for
it
?
--
who
thought
that
his
own
*NL*
self-respect
was
a
higher
tribunal
than
any
external
opinion
?
The
same
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
,
only
under
different
conditions
.
Our
deeds
determine
us
,
*NL*
as
much
as
we
determine
our
deeds
,
and
until
we
know
what
has
been
or
*NL*
will
be
the
peculiar
combination
of
outward
with
inward
facts
,
which
*NL*
constitutes
a
man
's
critical
actions
,
it
will
be
better
not
to
think
*NL*
ourselves
wise
about
his
character
.
There
is
a
terrible
coercion
in
*NL*
our
deeds
,
which
may
first
turn
the
honest
man
into
a
deceiver
and
then
*NL*
reconcile
him
to
the
change
,
for
this
reason
--
that
the
second
wrong
*NL*
presents
itself
to
him
in
the
guise
of
the
only
practicable
right
.
The
*NL*
action
which
before
commission
has
been
seen
with
that
blended
common
*NL*
sense
and
fresh
untarnished
feeling
which
is
the
healthy
eye
of
the
*NL*
soul
,
is
looked
at
afterwards
with
the
lens
of
apologetic
ingenuity
,
*NL*
through
which
all
things
that
men
call
beautiful
and
ugly
are
seen
to
*NL*
be
made
up
of
textures
very
much
alike
.
Europe
adjusts
itself
to
a
*NL*
_
fait
accompli
_
,
and
so
does
an
individual
character
--
until
the
placid
*NL*
adjustment
is
disturbed
by
a
convulsive
retribution
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
man
can
escape
this
vitiating
effect
of
an
offence
against
his
own
*NL*
sentiment
of
right
,
and
the
effect
was
the
stronger
in
Arthur
because
of
*NL*
that
very
need
of
self-respect
which
,
while
his
conscience
was
still
at
*NL*
ease
,
was
one
of
his
best
safeguards
.
Self-accusation
was
too
painful
to
*NL*
him
--
he
could
not
face
it
.
He
must
persuade
himself
that
he
had
not
been
*NL*
very
much
to
blame
;
he
began
even
to
pity
himself
for
the
necessity
he
*NL*
was
under
of
deceiving
Adam
--
it
was
a
course
so
opposed
to
the
honesty
*NL*
of
his
own
nature
.
But
then
,
it
was
the
only
right
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
whatever
had
been
amiss
in
him
,
he
was
miserable
enough
in
*NL*
consequence
:
miserable
about
Hetty
;
miserable
about
this
letter
that
*NL*
he
had
promised
to
write
,
and
that
seemed
at
one
moment
to
be
a
gross
*NL*
barbarity
,
at
another
perhaps
the
greatest
kindness
he
could
do
to
her
.
*NL*
And
across
all
this
reflection
would
dart
every
now
and
then
a
sudden
*NL*
impulse
of
passionate
defiance
towards
all
consequences
.
He
would
carry
*NL*
Hetty
away
,
and
all
other
considerations
might
go
to
...
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
the
four
walls
of
his
room
made
an
intolerable
*NL*
prison
to
him
;
they
seemed
to
hem
in
and
press
down
upon
him
all
the
*NL*
crowd
of
contradictory
thoughts
and
conflicting
feelings
,
some
of
which
*NL*
would
fly
away
in
the
open
air
.
He
had
only
an
hour
or
two
to
make
up
*NL*
his
mind
in
,
and
he
must
get
clear
and
calm
.
Once
on
Meg
's
back
,
in
*NL*
the
fresh
air
of
that
fine
morning
,
he
should
be
more
master
of
the
*NL*
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pretty
creature
arched
her
bay
neck
in
the
sunshine
,
and
pawed
the
*NL*
gravel
,
and
trembled
with
pleasure
when
her
master
stroked
her
nose
,
and
*NL*
patted
her
,
and
talked
to
her
even
in
a
more
caressing
tone
than
usual
.
*NL*
He
loved
her
the
better
because
she
knew
nothing
of
his
secrets
.
But
*NL*
Meg
was
quite
as
well
acquainted
with
her
master
's
mental
state
as
many
*NL*
others
of
her
sex
with
the
mental
condition
of
the
nice
young
gentlemen
*NL*
towards
whom
their
hearts
are
in
a
state
of
fluttering
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
cantered
for
five
miles
beyond
the
Chase
,
till
he
was
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
a
hill
where
there
were
no
hedges
or
trees
to
hem
in
the
road
.
Then
*NL*
he
threw
the
bridle
on
Meg
's
neck
and
prepared
to
make
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
knew
that
their
meeting
yesterday
must
be
the
last
before
Arthur
*NL*
went
away
--
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
contriving
another
without
*NL*
exciting
suspicion
--
and
she
was
like
a
frightened
child
,
unable
to
think
*NL*
of
anything
,
only
able
to
cry
at
the
mention
of
parting
,
and
then
put
*NL*
her
face
up
to
have
the
tears
kissed
away
.
He
could
do
nothing
but
*NL*
comfort
her
,
and
lull
her
into
dreaming
on
.
A
letter
would
be
a
*NL*
dreadfully
abrupt
way
of
awakening
her
!
Yet
there
was
truth
in
what
Adam
*NL*
said
--
that
it
would
save
her
from
a
lengthened
delusion
,
which
might
be
*NL*
worse
than
a
sharp
immediate
pain
.
And
it
was
the
only
way
of
satisfying
*NL*
Adam
,
who
must
be
satisfied
,
for
more
reasons
than
one
.
If
he
could
have
*NL*
seen
her
again
!
But
that
was
impossible
;
there
was
such
a
thorny
hedge
*NL*
of
hindrances
between
them
,
and
an
imprudence
would
be
fatal
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
if
he
COULD
see
her
again
,
what
good
would
it
do
?
Only
cause
him
to
*NL*
suffer
more
from
the
sight
of
her
distress
and
the
remembrance
of
it
.
*NL*
Away
from
him
she
was
surrounded
by
all
the
motives
to
self-control
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
dread
here
fell
like
a
shadow
across
his
imagination
--
the
dread
*NL*
lest
she
should
do
something
violent
in
her
grief
;
and
close
upon
that
*NL*
dread
came
another
,
which
deepened
the
shadow
.
But
he
shook
them
off
*NL*
with
the
force
of
youth
and
hope
.
What
was
the
ground
for
painting
the
*NL*
future
in
that
dark
way
?
It
was
just
as
likely
to
be
the
reverse
.
Arthur
*NL*
told
himself
he
did
not
deserve
that
things
should
turn
out
badly
.
He
*NL*
had
never
meant
beforehand
to
do
anything
his
conscience
disapproved
;
*NL*
he
had
been
led
on
by
circumstances
.
There
was
a
sort
of
implicit
*NL*
confidence
in
him
that
he
was
really
such
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
,
*NL*
Providence
would
not
treat
him
harshly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
,
he
could
n't
help
what
would
come
now
:
all
he
could
do
*NL*
was
to
take
what
seemed
the
best
course
at
the
present
moment
.
And
he
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
that
course
was
to
make
the
way
open
between
*NL*
Adam
and
Hetty
.
Her
heart
might
really
turn
to
Adam
,
as
he
said
,
after
a
*NL*
while
;
and
in
that
case
there
would
have
been
no
great
harm
done
,
since
*NL*
it
was
still
Adam
's
ardent
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
.
To
be
sure
,
Adam
*NL*
was
deceived
--
deceived
in
a
way
that
Arthur
would
have
resented
as
a
*NL*
deep
wrong
if
it
had
been
practised
on
himself
.
That
was
a
reflection
*NL*
that
marred
the
consoling
prospect
.
Arthur
's
cheeks
even
burned
in
*NL*
mingled
shame
and
irritation
at
the
thought
.
But
what
could
a
man
do
in
*NL*
such
a
dilemma
?
He
was
bound
in
honour
to
say
no
word
that
could
injure
*NL*
Hetty
:
his
first
duty
was
to
guard
her
.
He
would
never
have
told
or
*NL*
acted
a
lie
on
his
own
account
.
Good
God
!
What
a
miserable
fool
he
was
*NL*
to
have
brought
himself
into
such
a
dilemma
;
and
yet
,
if
ever
a
man
had
*NL*
excuses
,
he
had
.
-LRB-
Pity
that
consequences
are
determined
not
by
excuses
*NL*
but
by
actions
!
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
letter
must
be
written
;
it
was
the
only
means
that
promised
*NL*
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
.
The
tears
came
into
Arthur
's
eyes
as
he
*NL*
thought
of
Hetty
reading
it
;
but
it
would
be
almost
as
hard
for
him
*NL*
to
write
it
;
he
was
not
doing
anything
easy
to
himself
;
and
this
*NL*
last
thought
helped
him
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
.
He
could
never
*NL*
deliberately
have
taken
a
step
which
inflicted
pain
on
another
and
left
*NL*
himself
at
ease
.
Even
a
movement
of
jealousy
at
the
thought
of
giving
up
*NL*
Hetty
to
Adam
went
to
convince
him
that
he
was
making
a
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
once
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
,
he
turned
Meg
round
and
set
*NL*
off
home
again
in
a
canter
.
The
letter
should
be
written
the
first
*NL*
thing
,
and
the
rest
of
the
day
would
be
filled
up
with
other
business
:
*NL*
he
should
have
no
time
to
look
behind
him
.
Happily
,
Irwine
and
Gawaine
*NL*
were
coming
to
dinner
,
and
by
twelve
o'clock
the
next
day
he
should
*NL*
have
left
the
Chase
miles
behind
him
.
There
was
some
security
in
this
*NL*
constant
occupation
against
an
uncontrollable
impulse
seizing
him
to
*NL*
rush
to
Hetty
and
thrust
into
her
hand
some
mad
proposition
that
would
*NL*
undo
everything
.
Faster
and
faster
went
the
sensitive
Meg
,
at
every
*NL*
slight
sign
from
her
rider
,
till
the
canter
had
passed
into
a
swift
*NL*
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
they
said
th
'
young
mester
war
took
ill
last
night
,
''
said
*NL*
sour
old
John
,
the
groom
,
at
dinner-time
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
``
He
's
*NL*
been
ridin
'
fit
to
split
the
mare
i
'
two
this
forenoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
happen
one
o
'
the
symptims
,
John
,
''
said
the
facetious
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
wish
he
war
let
blood
for
`
t
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
John
,
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
been
early
at
the
Chase
to
know
how
Arthur
was
,
and
had
been
*NL*
relieved
from
all
anxiety
about
the
effects
of
his
blow
by
learning
*NL*
that
he
was
gone
out
for
a
ride
.
At
five
o'clock
he
was
punctually
there
*NL*
again
,
and
sent
up
word
of
his
arrival
.
In
a
few
minutes
Pym
came
down
*NL*
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
to
Adam
,
saying
that
the
captain
*NL*
was
too
busy
to
see
him
,
and
had
written
everything
he
had
to
say
.
*NL*
The
letter
was
directed
to
Adam
,
but
he
went
out
of
doors
again
before
*NL*
opening
it
.
It
contained
a
sealed
enclosure
directed
to
Hetty
.
On
the
*NL*
inside
of
the
cover
Adam
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
enclosed
letter
I
have
written
everything
you
wish
.
I
leave
it
*NL*
to
you
to
decide
whether
you
will
be
doing
best
to
deliver
it
to
Hetty
*NL*
or
to
return
it
to
me
.
Ask
yourself
once
more
whether
you
are
not
taking
*NL*
a
measure
which
may
pain
her
more
than
mere
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
for
our
seeing
each
other
again
now
.
We
shall
meet
*NL*
with
better
feelings
some
months
hence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A.D.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
's
i
'
th
'
right
on
'
t
not
to
see
me
,
''
thought
Adam
.
``
It
's
*NL*
no
use
meeting
to
say
more
hard
words
,
and
it
's
no
use
meeting
to
shake
*NL*
hands
and
say
we
're
friends
again
.
We
're
not
friends
,
an
'
it
's
better
*NL*
not
to
pretend
it
.
I
know
forgiveness
is
a
man
's
duty
,
but
,
to
my
*NL*
thinking
,
that
can
only
mean
as
you
're
to
give
up
all
thoughts
o
'
taking
*NL*
revenge
:
it
can
never
mean
as
you
're
t
'
have
your
old
feelings
back
*NL*
again
,
for
that
's
not
possible
.
He
's
not
the
same
man
to
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
*NL*
feel
the
same
towards
him
.
God
help
me
!
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
feel
the
*NL*
same
towards
anybody
:
I
seem
as
if
I
'd
been
measuring
my
work
from
a
*NL*
false
line
,
and
had
got
it
all
to
measure
over
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
question
about
delivering
the
letter
to
Hetty
soon
absorbed
*NL*
Adam
's
thoughts
.
Arthur
had
procured
some
relief
to
himself
by
throwing
*NL*
the
decision
on
Adam
with
a
warning
;
and
Adam
,
who
was
not
given
to
*NL*
hesitation
,
hesitated
here
.
He
determined
to
feel
his
way
--
to
ascertain
*NL*
as
well
as
he
could
what
was
Hetty
's
state
of
mind
before
he
decided
on
*NL*
delivering
the
letter
.

Chapter

The
Delivery
of
the
Letter
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
Sunday
Adam
joined
the
Poysers
on
their
way
out
of
church
,
*NL*
hoping
for
an
invitation
to
go
home
with
them
.
He
had
the
letter
in
*NL*
his
pocket
,
and
was
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
Hetty
*NL*
alone
.
He
could
not
see
her
face
at
church
,
for
she
had
changed
her
*NL*
seat
,
and
when
he
came
up
to
her
to
shake
hands
,
her
manner
was
doubtful
*NL*
and
constrained
.
He
expected
this
,
for
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
*NL*
met
him
since
she
had
been
aware
that
he
had
seen
her
with
Arthur
in
the
*NL*
Grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
'll
go
on
with
us
,
Adam
,
''
Mr.
Poyser
said
when
they
reached
*NL*
the
turning
;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
fields
Adam
ventured
to
*NL*
offer
his
arm
to
Hetty
.
The
children
soon
gave
them
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
lingering
behind
a
little
,
and
then
Adam
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
contrive
for
me
to
walk
out
in
the
garden
a
bit
with
you
this
*NL*
evening
,
if
it
keeps
fine
,
Hetty
?
I
've
something
partic
`
lar
to
talk
to
*NL*
you
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
said
,
``
Very
well
.
''
She
was
really
as
anxious
as
Adam
was
that
she
*NL*
should
have
some
private
talk
with
him
.
She
wondered
what
he
thought
of
*NL*
her
and
Arthur
.
He
must
have
seen
them
kissing
,
she
knew
,
but
she
had
*NL*
no
conception
of
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
between
Arthur
and
Adam
.
*NL*
Her
first
feeling
had
been
that
Adam
would
be
very
angry
with
her
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
would
tell
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
but
it
never
entered
her
mind
*NL*
that
he
would
dare
to
say
anything
to
Captain
Donnithorne
.
It
was
a
*NL*
relief
to
her
that
he
behaved
so
kindly
to
her
to-day
,
and
wanted
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
alone
,
for
she
had
trembled
when
she
found
he
was
going
*NL*
home
with
them
lest
he
should
mean
``
to
tell
.
''
But
,
now
he
wanted
to
talk
*NL*
to
her
by
herself
,
she
should
learn
what
he
thought
and
what
he
meant
to
*NL*
do
.
She
felt
a
certain
confidence
that
she
could
persuade
him
not
to
*NL*
do
anything
she
did
not
want
him
to
do
;
she
could
perhaps
even
make
him
*NL*
believe
that
she
did
n't
care
for
Arthur
;
and
as
long
as
Adam
thought
*NL*
there
was
any
hope
of
her
having
him
,
he
would
do
just
what
she
liked
,
*NL*
she
knew
.
Besides
,
she
MUST
go
on
seeming
to
encourage
Adam
,
lest
her
*NL*
uncle
and
aunt
should
be
angry
and
suspect
her
of
having
some
secret
*NL*
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
's
little
brain
was
busy
with
this
combination
as
she
hung
on
*NL*
Adam
's
arm
and
said
``
yes
''
or
``
no
''
to
some
slight
observations
of
his
*NL*
about
the
many
hawthorn-berries
there
would
be
for
the
birds
this
*NL*
next
winter
,
and
the
low-hanging
clouds
that
would
hardly
hold
up
till
*NL*
morning
.
And
when
they
rejoined
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
she
could
pursue
her
*NL*
thoughts
without
interruption
,
for
Mr.
Poyser
held
that
though
a
young
*NL*
man
might
like
to
have
the
woman
he
was
courting
on
his
arm
,
he
would
*NL*
nevertheless
be
glad
of
a
little
reasonable
talk
about
business
the
*NL*
while
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
curious
to
hear
the
most
recent
*NL*
news
about
the
Chase
Farm
.
So
,
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
,
he
claimed
*NL*
Adam
's
conversation
for
himself
,
and
Hetty
laid
her
small
plots
and
*NL*
imagined
her
little
scenes
of
cunning
blandishment
,
as
she
walked
along
*NL*
by
the
hedgerows
on
honest
Adam
's
arm
,
quite
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
an
elegantly
clad
coquette
alone
in
her
boudoir
.
For
if
a
country
beauty
*NL*
in
clumsy
shoes
be
only
shallow-hearted
enough
,
it
is
astonishing
how
*NL*
closely
her
mental
processes
may
resemble
those
of
a
lady
in
society
*NL*
and
crinoline
,
who
applies
her
refined
intellect
to
the
problem
of
*NL*
committing
indiscretions
without
compromising
herself
.
Perhaps
the
*NL*
resemblance
was
not
much
the
less
because
Hetty
felt
very
unhappy
all
*NL*
the
while
.
The
parting
with
Arthur
was
a
double
pain
to
her
--
mingling
*NL*
with
the
tumult
of
passion
and
vanity
there
was
a
dim
undefined
fear
*NL*
that
the
future
might
shape
itself
in
some
way
quite
unlike
her
dream
.
*NL*
She
clung
to
the
comforting
hopeful
words
Arthur
had
uttered
in
their
*NL*
last
meeting
--
``
I
shall
come
again
at
Christmas
,
and
then
we
will
see
*NL*
what
can
be
done
.
''
She
clung
to
the
belief
that
he
was
so
fond
of
*NL*
her
,
he
would
never
be
happy
without
her
;
and
she
still
hugged
her
*NL*
secret
--
that
a
great
gentleman
loved
her
--
with
gratified
pride
,
as
a
*NL*
superiority
over
all
the
girls
she
knew
.
But
the
uncertainty
of
the
*NL*
future
,
the
possibilities
to
which
she
could
give
no
shape
,
began
to
*NL*
press
upon
her
like
the
invisible
weight
of
air
;
she
was
alone
on
her
*NL*
little
island
of
dreams
,
and
all
around
her
was
the
dark
unknown
water
*NL*
where
Arthur
was
gone
.
She
could
gather
no
elation
of
spirits
now
by
*NL*
looking
forward
,
but
only
by
looking
backward
to
build
confidence
on
*NL*
past
words
and
caresses
.
But
occasionally
,
since
Thursday
evening
,
her
*NL*
dim
anxieties
had
been
almost
lost
behind
the
more
definite
fear
that
*NL*
Adam
might
betray
what
he
knew
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
his
sudden
*NL*
proposition
to
talk
with
her
alone
had
set
her
thoughts
to
work
in
a
*NL*
new
way
.
She
was
eager
not
to
lose
this
evening
's
opportunity
;
and
after
*NL*
tea
,
when
the
boys
were
going
into
the
garden
and
Totty
begged
to
go
*NL*
with
them
,
Hetty
said
,
with
an
alacrity
that
surprised
Mrs.
Poyser
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
with
her
,
Aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
that
Adam
said
he
would
go
too
,
*NL*
and
soon
he
and
Hetty
were
left
alone
together
on
the
walk
by
the
*NL*
filbert-trees
,
while
the
boys
were
busy
elsewhere
gathering
the
large
*NL*
unripe
nuts
to
play
at
``
cob-nut
''
with
,
and
Totty
was
watching
them
with
*NL*
a
puppylike
air
of
contemplation
.
It
was
but
a
short
time
--
hardly
two
*NL*
months
--
since
Adam
had
had
his
mind
filled
with
delicious
hopes
as
he
*NL*
stood
by
Hetty
's
side
in
this
garden
.
The
remembrance
of
that
scene
had
*NL*
often
been
with
him
since
Thursday
evening
:
the
sunlight
through
*NL*
the
apple-tree
boughs
,
the
red
bunches
,
Hetty
's
sweet
blush
.
It
came
*NL*
importunately
now
,
on
this
sad
evening
,
with
the
low-hanging
clouds
,
but
*NL*
he
tried
to
suppress
it
,
lest
some
emotion
should
impel
him
to
say
more
*NL*
than
was
needful
for
Hetty
's
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
what
I
saw
on
Thursday
night
,
Hetty
,
''
he
began
,
``
you
wo
n't
think
*NL*
me
making
too
free
in
what
I
'm
going
to
say
.
If
you
was
being
courted
by
*NL*
any
man
as
`
ud
make
you
his
wife
,
and
I
'd
known
you
was
fond
of
him
and
*NL*
meant
to
have
him
,
I
should
have
no
right
to
speak
a
word
to
you
about
*NL*
it
;
but
when
I
see
you
're
being
made
love
to
by
a
gentleman
as
can
never
*NL*
marry
you
,
and
doesna
think
o

marrying
you
,
I
feel
bound
t
'
interfere
*NL*
for
you
.
I
ca
n't
speak
about
it
to
them
as
are
i
'
the
place
o
'
your
*NL*
parents
,
for
that
might
bring
worse
trouble
than
's
needful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
's
words
relieved
one
of
Hetty
's
fears
,
but
they
also
carried
a
*NL*
meaning
which
sickened
her
with
a
strengthened
foreboding
.
She
was
pale
*NL*
and
trembling
,
and
yet
she
would
have
angrily
contradicted
Adam
,
if
she
*NL*
had
dared
to
betray
her
feelings
.
But
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
so
young
,
you
know
,
Hetty
,
''
he
went
on
,
almost
tenderly
,
``
and
y
'
*NL*
have
n't
seen
much
o
'
what
goes
on
in
the
world
.
It
's
right
for
me
to
*NL*
do
what
I
can
to
save
you
from
getting
into
trouble
for
want
o
'
your
*NL*
knowing
where
you
're
being
led
to
.
If
anybody
besides
me
knew
what
I
*NL*
know
about
your
meeting
a
gentleman
and
having
fine
presents
from
him
,
*NL*
they
'd
speak
light
on
you
,
and
you
'd
lose
your
character
.
And
besides
*NL*
that
,
you
'll
have
to
suffer
in
your
feelings
,
wi
'
giving
your
love
to
*NL*
a
man
as
can
never
marry
you
,
so
as
he
might
take
care
of
you
all
your
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
paused
and
looked
at
Hetty
,
who
was
plucking
the
leaves
from
the
*NL*
filbert-trees
and
tearing
them
up
in
her
hand
.
Her
little
plans
and
*NL*
preconcerted
speeches
had
all
forsaken
her
,
like
an
ill-learnt
lesson
,
*NL*
under
the
terrible
agitation
produced
by
Adam
's
words
.
There
was
a
cruel
*NL*
force
in
their
calm
certainty
which
threatened
to
grapple
and
crush
her
*NL*
flimsy
hopes
and
fancies
.
She
wanted
to
resist
them
--
she
wanted
to
throw
*NL*
them
off
with
angry
contradiction
--
but
the
determination
to
conceal
what
*NL*
she
felt
still
governed
her
.
It
was
nothing
more
than
a
blind
prompting
*NL*
now
,
for
she
was
unable
to
calculate
the
effect
of
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
no
right
to
say
as
I
love
him
,
''
she
said
,
faintly
,
but
*NL*
impetuously
,
plucking
another
rough
leaf
and
tearing
it
up
.
She
was
very
*NL*
beautiful
in
her
paleness
and
agitation
,
with
her
dark
childish
eyes
*NL*
dilated
and
her
breath
shorter
than
usual
.
Adam
's
heart
yearned
over
her
*NL*
as
he
looked
at
her
.
Ah
,
if
he
could
but
comfort
her
,
and
soothe
her
,
*NL*
and
save
her
from
this
pain
;
if
he
had
but
some
sort
of
strength
that
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
rescue
her
poor
troubled
mind
,
as
he
would
have
*NL*
rescued
her
body
in
the
face
of
all
danger
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
must
be
so
,
Hetty
,
''
he
said
,
tenderly
;
``
for
I
canna
believe
*NL*
you
'd
let
any
man
kiss
you
by
yourselves
,
and
give
you
a
gold
box
with
*NL*
his
hair
,
and
go
a-walking
i
'
the
Grove
to
meet
him
,
if
you
didna
love
*NL*
him
.
I
'm
not
blaming
you
,
for
I
know
it
`
ud
begin
by
little
and
little
,
*NL*
till
at
last
you
'd
not
be
able
to
throw
it
off
.
It
's
him
I
blame
for
*NL*
stealing
your
love
i
'
that
way
,
when
he
knew
he
could
never
make
you
*NL*
the
right
amends
.
He
's
been
trifling
with
you
,
and
making
a
plaything
of
*NL*
you
,
and
caring
nothing
about
you
as
a
man
ought
to
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
does
care
for
me
;
I
know
better
nor
you
,
''
Hetty
burst
out
.
*NL*
Everything
was
forgotten
but
the
pain
and
anger
she
felt
at
Adam
's
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Hetty
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
if
he
'd
cared
for
you
rightly
,
he
'd
never
*NL*
ha
'
behaved
so
.
He
told
me
himself
he
meant
nothing
by
his
kissing
and
*NL*
presents
,
and
he
wanted
to
make
me
believe
as
you
thought
light
of
'em
*NL*
too
.
But
I
know
better
nor
that
.
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
as
you
've
been
*NL*
trusting
to
his
loving
you
well
enough
to
marry
you
,
for
all
he
's
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
And
that
's
why
I
must
speak
to
you
about
it
,
Hetty
,
for
*NL*
fear
you
should
be
deceiving
yourself
.
It
's
never
entered
his
head
the
*NL*
thought
o
'
marrying
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
How
durst
you
say
so
?
''
said
Hetty
,
pausing
in
her
walk
*NL*
and
trembling
.
The
terrible
decision
of
Adam
's
tone
shook
her
with
fear
.
*NL*
She
had
no
presence
of
mind
left
for
the
reflection
that
Arthur
would
*NL*
have
his
reasons
for
not
telling
the
truth
to
Adam
.
Her
words
and
look
*NL*
were
enough
to
determine
Adam
:
he
must
give
her
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
ca
n't
believe
me
,
Hetty
,
because
you
think
too
well
of
*NL*
him
--
because
you
think
he
loves
you
better
than
he
does
.
But
I
've
got
*NL*
a
letter
i
'
my
pocket
,
as
he
wrote
himself
for
me
to
give
you
.
I
've
not
*NL*
read
the
letter
,
but
he
says
he
's
told
you
the
truth
in
it
.
But
before
*NL*
I
give
you
the
letter
,
consider
,
Hetty
,
and
do
n't
let
it
take
too
much
*NL*
hold
on
you
.
It
wouldna
ha
'
been
good
for
you
if
he
'd
wanted
to
do
such
*NL*
a
mad
thing
as
marry
you
:
it
`
ud
ha
'
led
to
no
happiness
i
'
th
'
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
said
nothing
;
she
felt
a
revival
of
hope
at
the
mention
of
a
*NL*
letter
which
Adam
had
not
read
.
There
would
be
something
quite
different
*NL*
in
it
from
what
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
took
out
the
letter
,
but
he
held
it
in
his
hand
still
,
while
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
tone
of
tender
entreaty
,
``
Do
n't
you
bear
me
ill
will
,
Hetty
,
*NL*
because
I
'm
the
means
o
'
bringing
you
this
pain
.
God
knows
I
'd
ha
'
borne
*NL*
a
good
deal
worse
for
the
sake
o
'
sparing
it
you
.
And
think
--
there
's
*NL*
nobody
but
me
knows
about
this
,
and
I
'll
take
care
of
you
as
if
I
was
*NL*
your
brother
.
You
're
the
same
as
ever
to
me
,
for
I
do
n't
believe
you
've
*NL*
done
any
wrong
knowingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
had
laid
her
hand
on
the
letter
,
but
Adam
did
not
loose
it
till
*NL*
he
had
done
speaking
.
She
took
no
notice
of
what
he
said
--
she
had
not
*NL*
listened
;
but
when
he
loosed
the
letter
,
she
put
it
into
her
pocket
,
*NL*
without
opening
it
,
and
then
began
to
walk
more
quickly
,
as
if
she
*NL*
wanted
to
go
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
the
right
not
to
read
it
just
yet
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
Read
it
when
*NL*
you
're
by
yourself
.
But
stay
out
a
little
bit
longer
,
and
let
us
call
*NL*
the
children
:
you
look
so
white
and
ill
,
your
aunt
may
take
notice
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
heard
the
warning
.
It
recalled
to
her
the
necessity
of
rallying
*NL*
her
native
powers
of
concealment
,
which
had
half
given
way
under
the
*NL*
shock
of
Adam
's
words
.
And
she
had
the
letter
in
her
pocket
:
she
was
*NL*
sure
there
was
comfort
in
that
letter
in
spite
of
Adam
.
She
ran
to
find
*NL*
Totty
,
and
soon
reappeared
with
recovered
colour
,
leading
Totty
,
who
was
*NL*
making
a
sour
face
because
she
had
been
obliged
to
throw
away
an
unripe
*NL*
apple
that
she
had
set
her
small
teeth
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hegh
,
Totty
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
come
and
ride
on
my
shoulder
--
ever
so
*NL*
high
--
you
'll
touch
the
tops
o
'
the
trees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
little
child
ever
refused
to
be
comforted
by
that
glorious
sense
of
*NL*
being
seized
strongly
and
swung
upward
?
I
do
n't
believe
Ganymede
cried
*NL*
when
the
eagle
carried
him
away
,
and
perhaps
deposited
him
on
Jove
's
*NL*
shoulder
at
the
end
.
Totty
smiled
down
complacently
from
her
secure
*NL*
height
,
and
pleasant
was
the
sight
to
the
mother
's
eyes
,
as
she
stood
at
*NL*
the
house
door
and
saw
Adam
coming
with
his
small
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your
sweet
face
,
my
pet
,
''
she
said
,
the
mother
's
strong
love
*NL*
filling
her
keen
eyes
with
mildness
,
as
Totty
leaned
forward
and
put
*NL*
out
her
arms
.
She
had
no
eyes
for
Hetty
at
that
moment
,
and
only
said
,
*NL*
without
looking
at
her
,
``
You
go
and
draw
some
ale
,
Hetty
;
the
gells
are
*NL*
both
at
the
cheese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
ale
had
been
drawn
and
her
uncle
's
pipe
lighted
,
there
was
*NL*
Totty
to
be
taken
to
bed
,
and
brought
down
again
in
her
night-gown
*NL*
because
she
would
cry
instead
of
going
to
sleep
.
Then
there
was
supper
*NL*
to
be
got
ready
,
and
Hetty
must
be
continually
in
the
way
to
give
help
.
*NL*
Adam
stayed
till
he
knew
Mrs.
Poyser
expected
him
to
go
,
engaging
her
*NL*
and
her
husband
in
talk
as
constantly
as
he
could
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
leaving
Hetty
more
at
ease
.
He
lingered
,
because
he
wanted
to
see
her
*NL*
safely
through
that
evening
,
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
how
much
*NL*
self-command
she
showed
.
He
knew
she
had
not
had
time
to
read
the
*NL*
letter
,
but
he
did
not
know
she
was
buoyed
up
by
a
secret
hope
that
the
*NL*
letter
would
contradict
everything
he
had
said
.
It
was
hard
work
for
him
*NL*
to
leave
her
--
hard
to
think
that
he
should
not
know
for
days
how
she
was
*NL*
bearing
her
trouble
.
But
he
must
go
at
last
,
and
all
he
could
do
was
*NL*
to
press
her
hand
gently
as
he
said
``
Good-bye
,
''
and
hope
she
would
take
*NL*
that
as
a
sign
that
if
his
love
could
ever
be
a
refuge
for
her
,
it
was
*NL*
there
the
same
as
ever
.
How
busy
his
thoughts
were
,
as
he
walked
home
,
*NL*
in
devising
pitying
excuses
for
her
folly
,
in
referring
all
her
weakness
*NL*
to
the
sweet
lovingness
of
her
nature
,
in
blaming
Arthur
,
with
less
and
*NL*
less
inclination
to
admit
that
his
conduct
might
be
extenuated
too
!
His
*NL*
exasperation
at
Hetty
's
suffering
--
and
also
at
the
sense
that
she
was
*NL*
possibly
thrust
for
ever
out
of
his
own
reach
--
deafened
him
to
any
*NL*
plea
for
the
miscalled
friend
who
had
wrought
this
misery
.
Adam
was
a
*NL*
clear-sighted
,
fair-minded
man
--
a
fine
fellow
,
indeed
,
morally
as
well
*NL*
as
physically
.
But
if
Aristides
the
Just
was
ever
in
love
and
jealous
,
*NL*
he
was
at
that
moment
not
perfectly
magnanimous
.
And
I
can
not
pretend
*NL*
that
Adam
,
in
these
painful
days
,
felt
nothing
but
righteous
indignation
*NL*
and
loving
pity
.
He
was
bitterly
jealous
,
and
in
proportion
as
his
love
*NL*
made
him
indulgent
in
his
judgment
of
Hetty
,
the
bitterness
found
a
vent
*NL*
in
his
feeling
towards
Arthur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
head
was
allays
likely
to
be
turned
,
''
he
thought
,
``
when
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
with
his
fine
manners
,
and
fine
clothes
,
and
his
white
hands
,
*NL*
and
that
way
o
'
talking
gentlefolks
have
,
came
about
her
,
making
up
to
*NL*
her
in
a
bold
way
,
as
a
man
could
n't
do
that
was
only
her
equal
;
and
*NL*
it
's
much
if
she
'll
ever
like
a
common
man
now
.
''
He
could
not
help
*NL*
drawing
his
own
hands
out
of
his
pocket
and
looking
at
them
--
at
the
hard
*NL*
palms
and
the
broken
finger-nails
.
``
I
'm
a
roughish
fellow
,
altogether
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
,
now
I
come
to
think
o
n't
,
what
there
is
much
for
a
woman
to
*NL*
like
about
me
;
and
yet
I
might
ha
'
got
another
wife
easy
enough
,
if
*NL*
I
had
n't
set
my
heart
on
her
.
But
it
's
little
matter
what
other
women
*NL*
think
about
me
,
if
she
ca
n't
love
me
.
She
might
ha
'
loved
me
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
as
likely
as
any
other
man
--
there
's
nobody
hereabouts
as
I
'm
afraid
of
,
*NL*
if
he
had
n't
come
between
us
;
but
now
I
shall
belike
be
hateful
to
her
*NL*
because
I
'm
so
different
to
him
.
And
yet
there
's
no
telling
--
she
may
*NL*
turn
round
the
other
way
,
when
she
finds
he
's
made
light
of
her
all
the
*NL*
while
.
She
may
come
to
feel
the
vally
of
a
man
as
`
ud
be
thankful
to
be
*NL*
bound
to
her
all
his
life
.
But
I
must
put
up
with
it
whichever
way
it
*NL*
is
--
I
've
only
to
be
thankful
it
's
been
no
worse
.
I
am
not
th
'
only
man
*NL*
that
's
got
to
do
without
much
happiness
i
'
this
life
.
There
's
many
a
*NL*
good
bit
o
'
work
done
with
a
bad
heart
.
It
's
God
's
will
,
and
that
's
*NL*
enough
for
us
:
we
should
n't
know
better
how
things
ought
to
be
than
He
*NL*
does
,
I
reckon
,
if
we
was
to
spend
our
lives
i
'
puzzling
.
But
it
`
ud
ha
'
*NL*
gone
near
to
spoil
my
work
for
me
,
if
I
'd
seen
her
brought
to
sorrow
and
*NL*
shame
,
and
through
the
man
as
I
've
always
been
proud
to
think
on
.
Since
*NL*
I
've
been
spared
that
,
I
've
no
right
to
grumble
.
When
a
man
's
got
his
*NL*
limbs
whole
,
he
can
bear
a
smart
cut
or
two
.

*NL*
*NL*
As
Adam
was
getting
over
a
stile
at
this
point
in
his
reflections
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
man
walking
along
the
field
before
him
.
He
knew
it
was
Seth
,
*NL*
returning
from
an
evening
preaching
,
and
made
haste
to
overtake
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
thee
`
dst
be
at
home
before
me
,
''
he
said
,
as
Seth
turned
round
*NL*
to
wait
for
him
,
``
for
I
'm
later
than
usual
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
later
too
,
for
I
got
into
talk
,
after
meeting
,
with
John
*NL*
Barnes
,
who
has
lately
professed
himself
in
a
state
of
perfection
,
*NL*
and
I
'd
a
question
to
ask
him
about
his
experience
.
It
's
one
o
'
them
*NL*
subjects
that
lead
you
further
than
y
'
expect
--
they
do
n't
lie
along
the
*NL*
straight
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
together
in
silence
two
or
three
minutes
.
Adam
was
not
*NL*
inclined
to
enter
into
the
subtleties
of
religious
experience
,
but
he
*NL*
was
inclined
to
interchange
a
word
or
two
of
brotherly
affection
and
*NL*
confidence
with
Seth
.
That
was
a
rare
impulse
in
him
,
much
as
the
*NL*
brothers
loved
each
other
.
They
hardly
ever
spoke
of
personal
matters
,
*NL*
or
uttered
more
than
an
allusion
to
their
family
troubles
.
Adam
was
*NL*
by
nature
reserved
in
all
matters
of
feeling
,
and
Seth
felt
a
certain
*NL*
timidity
towards
his
more
practical
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seth
,
lad
,
''
Adam
said
,
putting
his
arm
on
his
brother
's
shoulder
,
``
hast
*NL*
heard
anything
from
Dinah
Morris
since
she
went
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
She
told
me
I
might
write
her
word
after
a
while
,
how
*NL*
we
went
on
,
and
how
mother
bore
up
under
her
trouble
.
So
I
wrote
to
her
*NL*
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
told
her
about
thee
having
a
new
employment
,
and
*NL*
how
Mother
was
more
contented
;
and
last
Wednesday
,
when
I
called
at
the
*NL*
post
at
Treddles
`
on
,
I
found
a
letter
from
her
.
I
think
thee
`
dst
perhaps
*NL*
like
to
read
it
,
but
I
didna
say
anything
about
it
because
thee
`
st
*NL*
seemed
so
full
of
other
things
.
It
's
quite
easy
t

read
--
she
writes
*NL*
wonderful
for
a
woman

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
had
drawn
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Adam
,
who
*NL*
said
,
as
he
took
it
,
``
Aye

mounted

*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
went
in
again
quickly
and
lighted
a
candle
,
for
she
had
heard
*NL*
the
welcome
rustling
of
footsteps
on
the
grass
,
before
Gyp
's
joyful
*NL*
bark

*NL*
*NL*

some

*NL*
Adam
,
meanwhile

was
reading

light

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
BROTHER
SETH
--
Your
letter
lay
three
days
beyond
my
knowing
of
it
*NL*
at
the
post
,
for
I
had
not
money
enough
by
me
to
pay
the
carriage
,
this
*NL*
being
a
time
of
great
need
and
sickness
here
,
with
the
rains
that
have
*NL*
fallen
,
as
if
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened
again
;
and
to
lay
*NL*
by
money
,
from
day
to
day
,
in
such
a
time
,
when
there
are
so
many
in
*NL*
present
need
of
all
things
,
would
be
a
want
of
trust
like
the
laying
*NL*
up
of
the
manna
.
I
speak
of
this
,
because
I
would
not
have
you
think
me
*NL*
slow
to
answer
,
or
that
I
had
small
joy
in
your
rejoicing
at
the
worldly
*NL*
good
that
has
befallen
your
brother
Adam
.
The
honour
and
love
you
bear
*NL*
him
is
nothing
but
meet
,
for
God
has
given
him
great
gifts
,
and
he
uses
*NL*
them
as
the
patriarch
Joseph
did
,
who
,
when
he
was
exalted
to
a
place
of
*NL*
power
and
trust
,
yet
yearned
with
tenderness
towards
his
parent
and
his
*NL*
younger
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
is
knit
to
your
aged
mother
since
it
was
granted
me
to
be
near
*NL*
her
in
the
day
of
trouble
.
Speak
to
her
of
me
,
and
tell
her
I
often
bear
*NL*
her
in
my
thoughts
at
evening
time
,
when
I
am
sitting
in
the
dim
light
*NL*
as
I
did
with
her
,
and
we
held
one
another
's
hands
,
and
I
spoke
the
*NL*
words
of
comfort
that
were
given
to
me
.
Ah
,
that
is
a
blessed
time
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
,
Seth
,
when
the
outward
light
is
fading
,
and
the
body
is
a
*NL*
little
wearied
with
its
work
and
its
labour
.
Then
the
inward
light
*NL*
shines
the
brighter
,
and
we
have
a
deeper
sense
of
resting
on
the
Divine
*NL*
strength
.
I
sit
on
my
chair
in
the
dark
room
and
close
my
eyes
,
and
it
*NL*
is
as
if
I
was
out
of
the
body
and
could
feel
no
want
for
evermore
.
For
*NL*
then
,
the
very
hardship
,
and
the
sorrow
,
and
the
blindness
,
and
the
sin
*NL*
I
have
beheld
and
been
ready
to
weep
over
--
yea
,
all
the
anguish
of
the
*NL*
children
of
men
,
which
sometimes
wraps
me
round
like
sudden
darkness
--
I
*NL*
can
bear
with
a
willing
pain
,
as
if
I
was
sharing
the
Redeemer
's
cross
.
*NL*
For
I
feel
it
,
I
feel
it
--
infinite
love
is
suffering
too
--
yea
,
in
the
*NL*
fulness
of
knowledge
it
suffers
,
it
yearns
,
it
mourns
;
and
that
is
a
*NL*
blind
self-seeking
which
wants
to
be
freed
from
the
sorrow
wherewith
*NL*
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
.
Surely
it
is
not
true
*NL*
blessedness
to
be
free
from
sorrow
,
while
there
is
sorrow
and
sin
in
the
*NL*
world
:
sorrow
is
then
a
part
of
love
,
and
love
does
not
seek
to
throw
it
*NL*
off
.
It
is
not
the
spirit
only
that
tells
me
this
--
I
see
it
in
the
whole
*NL*
work
and
word
of
the
Gospel
.
Is
there
not
pleading
in
heaven
?
Is
not
the
*NL*
Man
of
Sorrows
there
in
that
crucified
body
wherewith
he
ascended
?
And
*NL*
is
He
not
one
with
the
Infinite
Love
itself
--
as
our
love
is
one
with
our
*NL*
sorrow
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
thoughts
have
been
much
borne
in
on
me
of
late
,
and
I
have
seen
*NL*
with
new
clearness
the
meaning
of
those
words
,
`
If
any
man
love
me
,
let
*NL*
him
take
up
my
cross
.
'
I
have
heard
this
enlarged
on
as
if
it
meant
the
*NL*
troubles
and
persecutions
we
bring
on
ourselves
by
confessing
Jesus
.
But
*NL*
surely
that
is
a
narrow
thought
.
The
true
cross
of
the
Redeemer
was
the
*NL*
sin
and
sorrow
of
this
world
--
that
was
what
lay
heavy
on
his
heart
--
and
*NL*
that
is
the
cross
we
shall
share
with
him
,
that
is
the
cup
we
must
drink
*NL*
of
with
him
,
if
we
would
have
any
part
in
that
Divine
Love
which
is
one
*NL*
with
his
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
outward
lot
,
which
you
ask
about
,
I
have
all
things
and
abound
.
I
*NL*
have
had
constant
work
in
the
mill
,
though
some
of
the
other
hands
have
*NL*
been
turned
off
for
a
time
,
and
my
body
is
greatly
strengthened
,
so
that
*NL*
I
feel
little
weariness
after
long
walking
and
speaking
.
What
you
say
*NL*
about
staying
in
your
own
country
with
your
mother
and
brother
shows
me
*NL*
that
you
have
a
true
guidance
;
your
lot
is
appointed
there
by
a
clear
*NL*
showing
,
and
to
seek
a
greater
blessing
elsewhere
would
be
like
laying
a
*NL*
false
offering
on
the
altar
and
expecting
the
fire
from
heaven
to
kindle
*NL*
it
.
My
work
and
my
joy
are
here
among
the
hills
,
and
I
sometimes
think
*NL*
I
cling
too
much
to
my
life
among
the
people
here
,
and
should
be
*NL*
rebellious
if
I
was
called
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thankful
for
your
tidings
about
the
dear
friends
at
the
Hall
*NL*
Farm
,
for
though
I
sent
them
a
letter
,
by
my
aunt
's
desire
,
after
I
came
*NL*
back
from
my
sojourn
among
them
,
I
have
had
no
word
from
them
.
My
*NL*
aunt
has
not
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer
,
and
the
work
of
the
house
is
*NL*
sufficient
for
the
day
,
for
she
is
weak
in
body
.
My
heart
cleaves
to
her
*NL*
and
her
children
as
the
nearest
of
all
to
me
in
the
flesh
--
yea
,
and
to
*NL*
all
in
that
house
.
I
am
carried
away
to
them
continually
in
my
sleep
,
*NL*
and
often
in
the
midst
of
work
,
and
even
of
speech
,
the
thought
of
them
*NL*
is
borne
in
on
me
as
if
they
were
in
need
and
trouble
,
which
yet
is
dark
*NL*
to
me
.
There
may
be
some
leading
here
;
but
I
wait
to
be
taught
.
You
say
*NL*
they
are
all
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
each
other
again
in
the
body
,
I
trust
,
though
,
it
may
be
,
*NL*
not
for
a
long
while
;
for
the
brethren
and
sisters
at
Leeds
are
desirous
*NL*
to
have
me
for
a
short
space
among
them
,
when
I
have
a
door
opened
me
*NL*
again
to
leave
Snowfield

Farewell

For

it

to
see
each

face
to
face

and
to

communion
together

feel
the
same
spirit
working
in
both
can
*NL*
never
more
be
sundered

For
their

to
write
the
words
so
small
as
you
do
and
my
pen
moves
*NL*
slow

And
so
I
am
straitened
,
and
say
but
little
of
what
is
in
my
mind
.
*NL*
Greet
your
mother
for
me
with
a
kiss

She
asked
me
to
kiss
her
twice
*NL*
when
we
parted

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
refolded
the
letter
,
and
was
sitting
meditatively
with
his
head
*NL*
resting
on
his
arm
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
when
Seth
came
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
read
the
letter
?
''
said
Seth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should

thought
of
her

I

never
seen
her
:
I

I

a

hateful

But
she
's
one
as
makes
everything
seem
right
she
says
*NL*
and
does
,
and
I
seemed
to
see
her
and
hear
her
speaking
when
I
read
the
*NL*
letter
.
It
's
wonderful
how
I
remember
her
looks
and
her
voice

She
'd
*NL*
make
thee
rare
and
happy

Seth

she
's
just
the
woman
for
thee

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
thinking
o

that
,
''
said
Seth
,
despondingly
.
``
She
spoke
so
*NL*
firm
,

she
's
not
the

one
thing

another

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,

her
feelings
may
grow

I

have

by

make

to
be
away
three

four

thirty

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should

*NL*
*NL*
``

Adam
emphatically

getting
up

throwing
off
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

Seth

rather
timidly

*NL*
*NL*
In
Hetty
's
Bed-Chamber
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
no
longer
light
enough
to
go
to
bed
without
a
candle
,
even
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
's
early
household
,
and
Hetty
carried
one
with
her
as
she
*NL*
went
up
at
last
to
her
bedroom
soon
after
Adam
was
gone
,
and
bolted
the
*NL*
door
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
would
read
her
letter
.
It
must
--
it
must
have
comfort
in
it
.
How
*NL*
was
Adam
to
know
the
truth
?
It
was
always
likely
he
should
say
what
he
*NL*
did
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
down
the
candle
and
took
out
the
letter
.
It
had
a
faint
scent
of
*NL*
roses
,
which
made
her
feel
as
if
Arthur
were
close
to
her
.
She
put
it
to
*NL*
her
lips
,
and
a
rush
of
remembered
sensations
for
a
moment
or
two
swept
*NL*
away
all
fear
.
But
her
heart
began
to
flutter
strangely
,
and
her
hands
*NL*
to
tremble
as
she
broke
the
seal
.
She
read
slowly
;
it
was
not
easy
for
*NL*
her
to
read
a
gentleman
's
handwriting
,
though
Arthur
had
taken
pains
to
*NL*
write
plainly

``
DEAREST
HETTY
--
I
have
spoken
truly
when
I
have
said
that
I
loved
you
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
never
forget
our
love
.
I
shall
be
your
true
friend
as
long
*NL*
as
life
lasts
,
and
I
hope
to
prove
this
to
you
in
many
ways
.
If
I
say
*NL*
anything
to
pain
you
in
this
letter
,
do
not
believe
it
is
for
want
of
*NL*
love
and
tenderness
towards
you
,
for
there
is
nothing
I
would
not
do
*NL*
for
you
,
if
I
knew
it
to
be
really
for
your
happiness
.
I
can
not
bear
to
*NL*
think
of
my
little
Hetty
shedding
tears
when
I
am
not
there
to
kiss
them
*NL*
away
;
and
if
I
followed
only
my
own
inclinations
,
I
should
be
with
her
*NL*
at
this
moment
instead
of
writing
.
It
is
very
hard
for
me
to
part
from
*NL*
her
--
harder
still
for
me
to
write
words
which
may
seem
unkind
,
though
*NL*
they
spring
from
the
truest
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
Hetty
,
sweet
as
our
love
has
been
to
me
,
sweet
as
it
would
*NL*
be
to
me
for
you
to
love
me
always
,
I
feel
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
better
for
us
both
if
we
had
never
had
that
happiness
,
and
that
it
is
*NL*
my
duty
to
ask
you
to
love
me
and
care
for
me
as
little
as
you
can
.
The
*NL*
fault
has
all
been
mine
,
for
though
I
have
been
unable
to
resist
the
*NL*
longing
to
be
near
you
,
I
have
felt
all
the
while
that
your
affection
*NL*
for
me
might
cause
you
grief
.
I
ought
to
have
resisted
my
feelings
.
I
*NL*
should
have
done
so
,
if
I
had
been
a
better
fellow
than
I
am
;
but
now
,
*NL*
since
the
past
can
not
be
altered
,
I
am
bound
to
save
you
from
any
evil
*NL*
that
I
have
power
to
prevent
.
And
I
feel
it
would
be
a
great
evil
for
*NL*
you
if
your
affections
continued
so
fixed
on
me
that
you
could
think
of
*NL*
no
other
man
who
might
be
able
to
make
you
happier
by
his
love
than
I
*NL*
ever
can
,
and
if
you
continued
to
look
towards
something
in
the
future
*NL*
which
can
not
possibly
happen
.
For
,
dear
Hetty
,
if
I
were
to
do
what
you
*NL*
one
day
spoke
of
,
and
make
you
my
wife
,
I
should
do
what
you
yourself
*NL*
would
come
to
feel
was
for
your
misery
instead
of
your
welfare
.
I
know
*NL*
you
can
never
be
happy
except
by
marrying
a
man
in
your
own
station
;
and
*NL*
if
I
were
to
marry
you
now
,
I
should
only
be
adding
to
any
wrong
I
have
*NL*
done
,
besides
offending
against
my
duty
in
the
other
relations
of
life
.
*NL*
You
know
nothing
,
dear
Hetty
,
of
the
world
in
which
I
must
always
live
,
*NL*
and
you
would
soon
begin
to
dislike
me
,
because
there
would
be
so
little
*NL*
in
which
we
should
be
alike
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
since
I
can
not
marry
you
,
we
must
part
--
we
must
try
not
to
feel
*NL*
like
lovers
any
more
.
I
am
miserable
while
I
say
this
,
but
nothing
else
*NL*
can
be
.
Be
angry
with
me
,
my
sweet
one
,
I
deserve
it
;
but
do
not
believe
*NL*
that
I
shall
not
always
care
for
you
--
always
be
grateful
to
you
--
always
*NL*
remember
my
Hetty
;
and
if
any
trouble
should
come
that
we
do
not
now
*NL*
foresee
,
trust
in
me
to
do
everything
that
lies
in
my
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
where
you
are
to
direct
a
letter
to
,
if
you
want
to
*NL*
write
,
but
I
put
it
down
below
lest
you
should
have
forgotten
.
Do
not
*NL*
write
unless
there
is
something
I
can
really
do
for
you
;
for
,
dear
*NL*
Hetty
,
we
must
try
to
think
of
each
other
as
little
as
we
can
.
Forgive
*NL*
me
,
and
try
to
forget
everything
about
me

except
that
I
shall
be

as

long

affectionate

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
Hetty
had
read
this
letter
;
and
when
she
looked
up
from
it
there
*NL*
was
the
reflection
of
a
blanched
face
in
the
old
dim
glass
--
a
white
*NL*
marble
face
with
rounded
childish
forms
,
but
with
something
sadder
than
*NL*
a
child
's
pain
in
it
.
Hetty
did
not
see
the
face
--
she
saw
nothing
--
she
*NL*
only
felt
that
she
was
cold
and
sick
and
trembling
.
The
letter
shook
and
*NL*
rustled
in
her
hand
.
She
laid
it
down
.
It
was
a
horrible
sensation
--
this
*NL*
cold
and
trembling
.
It
swept
away
the
very
ideas
that
produced
it
,
and
*NL*
Hetty
got
up
to
reach
a
warm
cloak
from
her
clothes-press
,
wrapped
it
*NL*
round
her
,
and
sat
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
nothing
but
getting
warm
.
*NL*
Presently
she
took
up
the
letter
with
a
firmer
hand
,
and
began
to
read
*NL*
it
through
again
.
The
tears
came
this
time
--
great
rushing
tears
that
*NL*
blinded
her
and
blotched
the
paper
.
She
felt
nothing
but
that
Arthur
was
*NL*
cruel
--
cruel
to
write
so
,
cruel
not
to
marry
her
.
Reasons
why
he
could
*NL*
not
marry
her
had
no
existence
for
her
mind
;
how
could
she
believe
in
*NL*
any
misery
that
could
come
to
her
from
the
fulfilment
of
all
she
had
*NL*
been
longing
for
and
dreaming
of
?
She
had
not
the
ideas
that
could
make
*NL*
up
the
notion
of
that
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
threw
down
the
letter
again
,
she
caught
sight
of
her
face
in
the
*NL*
glass
;
it
was
reddened
now
,
and
wet
with
tears
;
it
was
almost
like
a
*NL*
companion
that
she
might
complain
to
--
that
would
pity
her
.
She
leaned
*NL*
forward
on
her
elbows
,
and
looked
into
those
dark
overflooding
eyes
and
*NL*
at
the
quivering
mouth
,
and
saw
how
the
tears
came
thicker
and
thicker
,
*NL*
and
how
the
mouth
became
convulsed
with
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shattering
of
all
her
little
dream-world
,
the
crushing
blow
on
*NL*
her
new-born
passion
,
afflicted
her
pleasure-craving
nature
with
an
*NL*
overpowering
pain
that
annihilated
all
impulse
to
resistance
,
and
*NL*
suspended
her
anger
.
She
sat
sobbing
till
the
candle
went
out
,
and
then
,
*NL*
wearied
,
aching
,
stupefied
with
crying
,
threw
herself
on
the
bed
without
*NL*
undressing
and
went
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
feeble
dawn
in
the
room
when
Hetty
awoke
,
a
little
after
*NL*
four
o'clock
,
with
a
sense
of
dull
misery
,
the
cause
of
which
broke
upon
*NL*
her
gradually
as
she
began
to
discern
the
objects
round
her
in
the
dim
*NL*
light
.
And
then
came
the
frightening
thought
that
she
had
to
conceal
her
*NL*
misery
as
well
as
to
bear
it
,
in
this
dreary
daylight
that
was
coming
.
*NL*
She
could
lie
no
longer
.
She
got
up
and
went
towards
the
table
:
there
*NL*
lay
the
letter
.
She
opened
her
treasure-drawer
:
there
lay
the
ear-rings
*NL*
and
the
locket
--
the
signs
of
all
her
short
happiness
--
the
signs
of
*NL*
the
lifelong
dreariness
that
was
to
follow
it
.
Looking
at
the
little
*NL*
trinkets
which
she
had
once
eyed
and
fingered
so
fondly
as
the
earnest
*NL*
of
her
future
paradise
of
finery
,
she
lived
back
in
the
moments
when
*NL*
they
had
been
given
to
her
with
such
tender
caresses
,
such
strangely
*NL*
pretty
words
,
such
glowing
looks
,
which
filled
her
with
a
bewildering
*NL*
delicious
surprise
--
they
were
so
much
sweeter
than
she
had
thought
*NL*
anything
could
be
.
And
the
Arthur
who
had
spoken
to
her
and
looked
at
*NL*
her
in
this
way
,
who
was
present
with
her
now
--
whose
arm
she
felt
round
*NL*
her
,
his
cheek
against
hers
,
his
very
breath
upon
her
--
was
the
cruel
,
*NL*
cruel
Arthur
who
had
written
that
letter
,
that
letter
which
she
snatched
*NL*
and
crushed
and
then
opened
again
,
that
she
might
read
it
once
more
.
The
*NL*
half-benumbed
mental
condition
which
was
the
effect
of
the
last
night
's
*NL*
violent
crying
made
it
necessary
to
her
to
look
again
and
see
if
her
*NL*
wretched
thoughts
were
actually
true
--
if
the
letter
was
really
so
cruel
.
*NL*
She
had
to
hold
it
close
to
the
window
,
else
she
could
not
have
read
it
*NL*
by
the
faint
light
.
Yes
!
It
was
worse
--
it
was
more
cruel
.
She
crushed
*NL*
it
up
again
in
anger
.
She
hated
the
writer
of
that
letter
--
hated
him
*NL*
for
the
very
reason
that
she
hung
upon
him
with
all
her
love
--
all
the
*NL*
girlish
passion
and
vanity
that
made
up
her
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
tears
this
morning
.
She
had
wept
them
all
away
last
night
,
*NL*
and
now
she
felt
that
dry-eyed
morning
misery
,
which
is
worse
than
the
*NL*
first
shock
because
it
has
the
future
in
it
as
well
as
the
present
.
*NL*
Every
morning
to
come
,
as
far
as
her
imagination
could
stretch
,
she
*NL*
would
have
to
get
up
and
feel
that
the
day
would
have
no
joy
for
her
.
*NL*
For
there
is
no
despair
so
absolute
as
that
which
comes
with
the
first
*NL*
moments
of
our
first
great
sorrow
,
when
we
have
not
yet
known
what
it
is
*NL*
to
have
suffered
and
be
healed
,
to
have
despaired
and
to
have
recovered
*NL*
hope
.
As
Hetty
began
languidly
to
take
off
the
clothes
she
had
worn
all
*NL*
the
night
,
that
she
might
wash
herself
and
brush
her
hair
,
she
had
a
*NL*
sickening
sense
that
her
life
would
go
on
in
this
way
.
She
should
always
*NL*
be
doing
things
she
had
no
pleasure
in
,
getting
up
to
the
old
tasks
of
*NL*
work
,
seeing
people
she
cared
nothing
about
,
going
to
church
,
and
to
*NL*
Treddleston
,
and
to
tea
with
Mrs.
Best
,
and
carrying
no
happy
thought
*NL*
with
her
.
For
her
short
poisonous
delights
had
spoiled
for
ever
all
the
*NL*
little
joys
that
had
once
made
the
sweetness
of
her
life
--
the
new
frock
*NL*
ready
for
Treddleston
Fair
,
the
party
at
Mr.
Britton
's
at
Broxton
wake
,
*NL*
the
beaux
that
she
would
say
``
No
''
to
for
a
long
while
,
and
the
prospect
*NL*
of
the
wedding
that
was
to
come
at
last
when
she
would
have
a
silk
gown
*NL*
and
a
great
many
clothes
all
at
once
.
These
things
were
all
flat
and
*NL*
dreary
to
her
now
;
everything
would
be
a
weariness
,
and
she
would
carry
*NL*
about
for
ever
a
hopeless
thirst
and
longing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
in
the
midst
of
her
languid
undressing
and
leaned
against
the
*NL*
dark
old
clothes-press
.
Her
neck
and
arms
were
bare
,
her
hair
hung
down
*NL*
in
delicate
rings
--
and
they
were
just
as
beautiful
as
they
were
that
*NL*
night
two
months
ago
,
when
she
walked
up
and
down
this
bed-chamber
*NL*
glowing
with
vanity
and
hope
.
She
was
not
thinking
of
her
neck
and
arms
*NL*
now
;
even
her
own
beauty
was
indifferent
to
her
.
Her
eyes
wandered
sadly
*NL*
over
the
dull
old
chamber
,
and
then
looked
out
vacantly
towards
the
*NL*
growing
dawn
.
Did
a
remembrance
of
Dinah
come
across
her
mind
?
Of
her
*NL*
foreboding
words
,
which
had
made
her
angry
?
Of
Dinah
's
affectionate
*NL*
entreaty
to
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
?
No
,
the
impression
*NL*
had
been
too
slight
to
recur
.
Any
affection
or
comfort
Dinah
could
*NL*
have
given
her
would
have
been
as
indifferent
to
Hetty
this
morning
as
*NL*
everything
else
was
except
her
bruised
passion
.
She
was
only
thinking
*NL*
she
could
never
stay
here
and
go
on
with
the
old
life
--
she
could
better
*NL*
bear
something
quite
new
than
sinking
back
into
the
old
everyday
round
.
*NL*
She
would
like
to
run
away
that
very
morning
,
and
never
see
any
of
the
*NL*
old
faces
again
.
But
Hetty
's
was
not
a
nature
to
face
difficulties
--
to
*NL*
dare
to
loose
her
hold
on
the
familiar
and
rush
blindly
on
some
unknown
*NL*
condition
.
Hers
was
a
luxurious
and
vain
nature
--
not
a
passionate
*NL*
one
--
and
if
she
were
ever
to
take
any
violent
measure
,
she
must
be
urged
*NL*
to
it
by
the
desperation
of
terror
.
There
was
not
much
room
for
her
*NL*
thoughts
to
travel
in
the
narrow
circle
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
soon
*NL*
fixed
on
the
one
thing
she
would
do
to
get
away
from
her
old
life
:
she
*NL*
would
ask
her
uncle
to
let
her
go
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
.
Miss
Lydia
's
maid
*NL*
would
help
her
to
get
a
situation
,
if
she
knew
Hetty
had
her
uncle
's
*NL*
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
thought
of
this
,
she
fastened
up
her
hair
and
began
to
*NL*
wash
:
it
seemed
more
possible
to
her
to
go
downstairs
and
try
to
behave
*NL*
as
usual
.
She
would
ask
her
uncle
this
very
day
.
On
Hetty
's
blooming
*NL*
health
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
such
mental
suffering
as
hers
to
*NL*
leave
any
deep
impress
;
and
when
she
was
dressed
as
neatly
as
usual
*NL*
in
her
working-dress
,
with
her
hair
tucked
up
under
her
little
cap
,
*NL*
an
indifferent
observer
would
have
been
more
struck
with
the
young
*NL*
roundness
of
her
cheek
and
neck
and
the
darkness
of
her
eyes
and
*NL*
eyelashes
than
with
any
signs
of
sadness
about
her
.
But
when
she
took
up
*NL*
the
crushed
letter
and
put
it
in
her
drawer
,
that
she
might
lock
it
out
*NL*
of
sight
,
hard
smarting
tears
,
having
no
relief
in
them
as
the
great
*NL*
drops
had
that
fell
last
night
,
forced
their
way
into
her
eyes
.
She
*NL*
wiped
them
away
quickly
:
she
must
not
cry
in
the
day-time
.
Nobody
should
*NL*
find
out
how
miserable
she
was
,
nobody
should
know
she
was
disappointed
*NL*
about
anything
;
and
the
thought
that
the
eyes
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
*NL*
would
be
upon
her
gave
her
the
self-command
which
often
accompanies
a
*NL*
great
dread
.
For
Hetty
looked
out
from
her
secret
misery
towards
the
*NL*
possibility
of
their
ever
knowing
what
had
happened
,
as
the
sick
and
*NL*
weary
prisoner
might
think
of
the
possible
pillory
.
They
would
think
her
*NL*
conduct
shameful
,
and
shame
was
torture
.
That
was
poor
little
Hetty
's
*NL*
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
locked
up
her
drawer
and
went
away
to
her
early
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
Mr.
Poyser
was
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
his
*NL*
good-nature
was
therefore
at
its
superlative
moment
,
Hetty
seized
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
her
aunt
's
absence
to
say
,
``
Uncle
,
I
wish
you
'd
let
me
go
*NL*
for
a
lady
's
maid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
Hetty
in
mild
*NL*
surprise
for
some
moments
.
She
was
sewing
,
and
went
on
with
her
work
*NL*
industriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
put
that
into
your
head
,
my
wench
?
''
he
said
at
last
,
after
*NL*
he
had
given
one
conservative
puff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
--
I
should
like
it
better
than
farm-work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
;
you
fancy
so
because
you
donna
know
it
,
my
wench
.
It
would
n't
*NL*
be
half
so
good
for
your
health
,
nor
for
your
luck
i
'
life
.
I
'd
like
you
*NL*
to
stay
wi
'
us
till
you
've
got
a
good
husband
:
you
're
my
own
niece
,
and
*NL*
I
would
n't
have
you
go
to
service
,
though
it
was
a
gentleman
's
house
,
as
*NL*
long
as
I
've
got
a
home
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
paused
,
and
puffed
away
at
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
needlework
,
''
said
Hetty
,
``
and
I
should
get
good
wages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
aunt
been
a
bit
sharp
wi
'
you
?
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
not
noticing
*NL*
Hetty
's
further
argument
.
``
You
mustna
mind
that
,
my
wench
--
she
does
it
*NL*
for
your
good
.
She
wishes
you
well
;
an
'
there
is
n't
many
aunts
as

no
*NL*
kin

she
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
n't
my
aunt
,
''
said
Hetty
,
``
but
I
should
like
the
work
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
all
very
well
for
you
to
learn
the
work
a
bit

I

*NL*

Mrs.
Pomfret
was
willing
to
teach
you
.
*NL*
For
if
anything
was

happen
,
it
's
well
to

I
niver

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Na-a-y
,
''
said
old
Martin
,
with
an
elongation
of
the
word
,
meant
to
make
*NL*
it
bitter
as
well
as
negative
,
while
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
down
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
``
But

wench

her
mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
seldom
the
old
man
made
so
long
a
speech
,
but
his
son
's
question
*NL*
had
fallen
like
a
bit
of
dry
fuel
on
the
embers
of
a
long
unextinguished
*NL*
resentment
,
which
had
always
made
the
grandfather
more
indifferent
to
*NL*
Hetty
than
to
his
son
's
children
.
Her
mother
's
fortune
had
been
spent
by
*NL*
that
good-for-nought
Sorrel
,
and
Hetty
had
Sorrel
's
blood
in
her
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
thing
,
poor
thing
!
''
said
Martin
the
younger
,
who
was
sorry
to
have
*NL*
provoked
this
retrospective
harshness
.
``
She
'd
but
bad
luck
.
But
Hetty
's
*NL*
got
as
good
a
chance
o
'
getting
a
solid
,
sober
husband
as
any
gell
i
'
*NL*
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
throwing
out
this
pregnant
hint
,
Mr.
Poyser
recurred
to
his
pipe
*NL*
and
his
silence
,
looking
at
Hetty
to
see
if
she
did
not
give
some
sign
*NL*
of
having
renounced
her
ill-advised
wish
.
But
instead
of
that
,
Hetty
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
herself
,
began
to
cry
,
half
out
of
ill
temper
at
the
denial
,
*NL*
half
out
of
the
day
's
repressed
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hegh
,
hegh
!
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
meaning
to
check
her
playfully
,
``
do
n't
*NL*
let

have
any
crying

Crying
's
for
them

not
for
*NL*
them
as

to
get
rid
o

''
he
continued
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
now
came
back
into
the
house-place
,
knitting
with
fierce
*NL*
rapidity
,
as
if
that
movement
were
a
necessary
function
,
like
the
*NL*
twittering
of
a
crab
's
antennae
.
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uncle
's
answers
,
however
,
had
had
another
effect
on
Hetty
besides
*NL*
that
of
disappointing
her
and
making
her
cry
.
She
knew
quite
well
whom
*NL*
he
had
in
his
mind
in
his
allusions
to
marriage
,
and
to
a
sober
,
solid
*NL*
husband
;
and
when
she
was
in
her
bedroom
again
,
the
possibility
of
her
*NL*
marrying
Adam
presented
itself
to
her
in
a
new
light
.
In
a
mind
where
no
*NL*
strong
sympathies
are
at
work
,
where
there
is
no
supreme
sense
of
*NL*
right
to
which
the
agitated
nature
can
cling
and
steady
itself
to
quiet
*NL*
endurance
,
one
of
the
first
results
of
sorrow
is
a
desperate
vague
*NL*
clutching
after
any
deed
that
will
change
the
actual
condition
.
Poor
*NL*
Hetty
's
vision
of
consequences
,
at
no
time
more
than
a
narrow
fantastic
*NL*
calculation
of
her
own
probable
pleasures
and
pains
,
was
now
quite
shut
*NL*
out
by
reckless
irritation
under
present
suffering
,
and
she
was
ready
*NL*
for
one
of
those
convulsive
,
motiveless
actions
by
which
wretched
men
*NL*
and
women
leap
from
a
temporary
sorrow
into
a
lifelong
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
should
she
not
marry
Adam
?
She
did
not
care
what
she
did
,
so
that
*NL*
it
made
some
change
in
her
life
.
She
felt
confident
that
he
would
still
*NL*
want
to
marry
her
,
and
any
further
thought
about
Adam
's
happiness
in
the
*NL*
matter
had
never
yet
visited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strange
!
''
perhaps
you
will
say
,
``
this
rush
of
impulse
to-wards
a
course
*NL*
that
might
have
seemed
the
most
repugnant
to
her
present
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
and
in
only
the
second
night
of
her
sadness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
actions
of
a
little
trivial
soul
like
Hetty
's
,
struggling
*NL*
amidst
the
serious
sad
destinies
of
a
human
being
,
are
strange
.
So
are
*NL*
the
motions
of
a
little
vessel
without
ballast
tossed
about
on
a
stormy
*NL*
sea
.
How
pretty
it
looked
with
its
parti-coloured
sail
in
the
sunlight
,
*NL*
moored
in
the
quiet
bay
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
that
man
bear
the
loss
who
loosed
it
from
its
moorings

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
will
not
save
the
vessel

the
pretty

been

a

Mrs.
Poyser
``
Has
Her
Say
Out
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
Saturday
evening
there
was
much
excited
discussion
at
the
*NL*
Donnithorne
Arms
concerning
an
incident
which
had
occurred
that
very
*NL*
day
--
no
less
than
a
second
appearance
of
the
smart
man
in
top-boots
said
*NL*
by
some
to
be
a
mere
farmer
in
treaty
for
the
Chase
Farm
,
by
others
to
*NL*
be
the
future
steward
,
but
by
Mr.
Casson
himself
,
the
personal
witness
*NL*
to
the
stranger
's
visit
,
pronounced
contemptuously
to
be
nothing
better
*NL*
than
a
bailiff
,
such
as
Satchell
had
been
before
him
.
No
one
had
thought
*NL*
of
denying
Mr.
Casson
's
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
*NL*
the
stranger
;
nevertheless
,
he
proffered
various
corroborating
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
him
myself
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
see
him
coming
along
by
the
Crab-tree
*NL*
Meadow
on
a
bald-faced
hoss
.
I
'd
just
been
t
'
hev
a
pint
--
it
was
*NL*
half
after
ten
i
'
the
fore-noon
,
when
I
hev
my
pint
as
reg
`
lar
as
the
*NL*
clock
--
and
I
says
to
Knowles
,
as
druv
up
with
his
waggon
,
`
You
'll
get
*NL*
a
bit
o
'
barley
to-day
,
Knowles
,
'
I
says
,
`
if
you
look
about
you
'
;
and
*NL*
then
I
went
round
by
the
rick-yard
,
and
towart
the
Treddles
`
on
road
,
and
*NL*
just
as
I
come
up
by
the
big
ash-tree
,
I
see
the
man
i
'
top-boots
coming
*NL*
along
on
a
bald-faced
hoss
--
I
wish
I
may
never
stir
if
I
did
n't
.
And
I
*NL*
stood
still
till
he
come
up
,
and
I
says
,
`
Good
morning
,
sir
,
'
I
says
,
*NL*
for
I
wanted
to
hear
the
turn
of
his
tongue
,
as
I
might
know
whether
he
*NL*
was
a
this-country
man
;
so
I
says
,
`
Good
morning
,
sir
:
it
'll

old

barley
this
morning

.
There
'll
be
a
bit
got

,
if
*NL*
we
've
good
luck

'
And
he
says
,
`
Eh
,
ye
may
be
raight
,
there
's
noo
*NL*
tallin
'
,
'
he
says
,
and
I
knowed
by
that
''
--
here
Mr.
Casson
gave
a
*NL*
wink
--
``
as
he
did
n't
come
from
a
hundred
mile
off
.
I
daresay
he
'd

hodd
talker
,
as

Loamshire
folks
allays
does

one
as

*NL*
the
right
language

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
right
language
!
''
said
Bartle
Massey
,
contemptuously
.
``
You
're
about
*NL*
as
near
the
right
language
as
a
pig
's
squeaking
is
like
a

played

*NL*
a
key-bugle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
answered
Mr.
Casson
,
with
an
angry
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
should
think
a
man
as
has
lived
among
the
gentry
from
a
by
,
is
likely
to
*NL*
know
what
's
the
right
language
pretty
nigh
as
well
as
a
schoolmaster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
man
,
''
said
Bartle
,
with
a
tone
of
sarcastic
consolation
,
*NL*
``
you
talk
the
right
language
for
you
.
When
Mike
Holdsworth
's
goat
says
*NL*
ba-a-a
,
it
's
all
right
--
it
`
ud
be
unnatural
for
it
to
make
any
other
*NL*
noise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
party
being
Loamshire
men
,
Mr.
Casson
had
the
laugh
*NL*
strongly
against
him
,
and
wisely
fell
back
on
the
previous
question
,
*NL*
which
,
far
from
being
exhausted
in
a
single
evening
,
was
renewed
in
*NL*
the
churchyard
,
before
service
,
the
next
day
,
with
the
fresh
interest
*NL*
conferred
on
all
news
when
there
is
a
fresh
person
to
hear
it
;
and
*NL*
that
fresh
hearer
was
Martin
Poyser
,
who
,
as
his
wife
said
,
``
never
*NL*
went
boozin
'
with
that
set
at
Casson
's
,
a-sittin
'
soakin
'
in
drink
,
and
*NL*
looking
as
wise
as
a
lot
o
'
cod-fish
wi
'
red
faces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
probably
owing
to
the
conversation
she
had
had
with
her
husband
*NL*
on
their
way
from
church
concerning
this
problematic
stranger
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
's
thoughts
immediately
reverted
to
him
when
,
a
day
or
two
*NL*
afterwards
,
as
she
was
standing
at
the
house-door
with
her
knitting
,
*NL*
in
that
eager
leisure
which
came
to
her
when
the
afternoon
cleaning
was
*NL*
done
,
she
saw
the
old
squire
enter
the
yard
on
his
black
pony
,
*NL*
followed
by
John
the
groom
.
She
always
cited
it
afterwards
as
a
case
of
*NL*
prevision
,
which
really
had
something
more
in
it
than
her
own
remarkable
*NL*
penetration
,
that
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
the
squire
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
I
shouldna
wonder
if
he
's
come
about
that
man
as
is
a-going
to
*NL*
take
the
Chase
Farm
,
wanting
Poyser
to
do
something
for
him
without
pay
.
*NL*
But
Poyser
's
a
fool
if
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
unwonted
must
clearly
be
in
the
wind
,
for
the
old
squire
's
*NL*
visits
to
his
tenantry
were
rare
;
and
though
Mrs.
Poyser
had
during
the
*NL*
last
twelvemonth
recited
many
imaginary
speeches
,
meaning
even
more
than
*NL*
met
the
ear
,
which
she
was
quite
determined
to
make
to
him
the
next
time
*NL*
he
appeared
within
the
gates
of
the
Hall
Farm
,
the
speeches
had
always
*NL*
remained
imaginary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
''
said
the
old
squire
,
peering
at
her
with
his
*NL*
short-sighted
eyes
--
a
mode
of
looking
at
her
which
,
as
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
observed
,
``
allays
aggravated
me
:
it
was
as
if
you
was
a
insect
,
and
he
*NL*
was
going
to
dab
his
finger-nail
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
said
,
``
Your
servant
,
sir
,
''
and
curtsied
with
an
air
of
*NL*
perfect
deference
as
she
advanced
towards
him
:
she
was
not
the
woman
*NL*
to
misbehave
towards
her
betters
,
and
fly
in
the
face
of
the
catechism
,
*NL*
without
severe
provocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
husband
at

Poyser

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hetty

come

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
they
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
and
the
old
gentleman
bowed
low
in
answer
to
Hetty
's
*NL*
curtsy
;
while
Totty
,
conscious
of
a
pinafore
stained
with
gooseberry
*NL*
jam
,
stood
hiding
her
face
against
the
clock
and
peeping
round
*NL*
furtively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

fine
old

said
Mr.

looking

He
always
spoke

deliberate

well-chiselled

whether
his
words
were
sugary

venomous

keeping

*NL*
Mr.

had
just
entered
in
shirt-sleeves

open
waistcoat
,
with
a

face
a
shade
redder

from
the
exertion

As

stood

red

rotund

radiant
,
before
the
small

wiry

cool
old

he
looked
like

apple
by

withered
crab

rolling

unrolling

out

reverse

sit
down

*NL*
``
And
now
,
Poyser
,
as
Satchell
is
laid
up
,
I
am
intending
to
let
the
*NL*
Chase
Farm
to
a
respectable
tenant
.
I
'm
tired
of
having
a
farm
on
my
*NL*
own
hands

nothing
is
made
the
best
of
in
such
cases
,
as
you
know

A
*NL*
satisfactory
bailiff
is
hard
to
find
;
and
I
think
you
and
I
,
Poyser
,
*NL*
and
your
excellent
wife
here
,
can
enter
into
a
little
arrangement
in
*NL*
consequence
,
which
will
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
a
good-natured
blankness
of
imagination
as
*NL*
to
the
nature
of
the
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'm
called
upon
to
speak

''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
after
glancing
at
*NL*
her
husband
with
pity
at
his
softness
,
``
you
know
better
than
me
;
but
I
*NL*
do

see
what
the
Chase
Farm
is

us
--
we
've
cumber
enough
wi

our
own
*NL*
farm
.
Not
but
what
I
'm
glad
to
hear
o

anybody
respectable
coming
into
*NL*
the
parish
;
there
's
some
as
ha

been
brought
in
as

that
character

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
likely
to
find
Mr.
Thurle
an
excellent
neighbour
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
--
such
a
one
as
you
will
feel
glad
to
have
accommodated
by
the
little
*NL*
plan
I
'm
going
to
mention
,
especially
as
I
hope
you
will
find
it
as
much
*NL*
to
your
own
advantage

his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
if
it
's
anything
t
'
our
advantage
,
it
'll
be
the
first
*NL*
offer
o
'
the
sort
I
've
heared
on
.
It
's
them
as
take
advantage
that
get
*NL*
advantage
i
'
this
world
,
I
think
.
Folks
have
to
wait
long
enough
afore
*NL*
it
's
brought
to
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
Poyser
,
''
said
the
squire
,
ignoring
Mrs.
Poyser
's
theory
of
*NL*
worldly
prosperity
,
``
there
is
too
much
dairy
land
,
and
too
little
plough
*NL*
land
,
on
the
Chase
Farm
to
suit
Thurle
's
purpose
--
indeed
,
he
will
only
*NL*
take
the
farm
on
condition
of
some
change
in
it
:
his
wife
,
it
appears
,
*NL*
is
not
a
clever
dairy-woman
,
like
yours
.
Now
,
the
plan
I
'm
thinking
of
*NL*
is
to
effect
a
little
exchange
.
If
you
were
to
have
the
Hollow
Pastures
,
*NL*
you
might
increase
your
dairy
,
which
must
be
so
profitable
under
your
*NL*
wife
's
management
;
and
I
should
request
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
to
supply
my
*NL*
house
with
milk
,
cream
,
and
butter
at
the
market
prices
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
Poyser
,
you
might
let
Thurle
have
the
Lower
and
Upper
Ridges
,
*NL*
which
really
,
with
our
wet
seasons
,
would
be
a
good
riddance
for
you
.
*NL*
There
is
much
less
risk
in
dairy
land
than
corn
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
was
leaning
forward
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
his
head
*NL*
on
one
side
,
and
his
mouth
screwed
up
--
apparently
absorbed
in
making
the
*NL*
tips
of
his
fingers
meet
so
as
to
represent
with
perfect
accuracy
the
*NL*
ribs
of
a
ship
.
He
was
much
too
acute
a
man
not
to
see
through
the
whole
*NL*
business
,
and
to
foresee
perfectly
what
would
be
his
wife
's
view
of
the
*NL*
subject
;
but
he
disliked
giving
unpleasant
answers
.
Unless
it
was
on
a
*NL*
point
of
farming
practice
,
he
would
rather
give
up
than
have
a
quarrel
,
*NL*
any
day
;
and
,
after
all
,
it
mattered
more
to
his
wife
than
to
him
.
So
,
*NL*
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
mildly
,
``
What
*NL*
dost
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
had
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
husband
with
cold
severity
*NL*
during
his
silence
,
but
now
she
turned
away
her
head
with
a
toss
,
looked
*NL*
icily
at
the
opposite
roof
of
the
cow-shed
,
and
spearing
her
knitting
*NL*
together
with
the
loose
pin
,
held
it
firmly
between
her
clasped
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
?
Why
,
I
say
you
may
do
as
you
like
about
giving
up
any
o

your
*NL*
corn-land
afore
your
lease
is
up
,
which
it
wo
n't
be
for
a
year
come
next
*NL*
Michaelmas
,
but
I
'll
not
consent
to
take
more
dairy
work
into
my
hands
,
*NL*
either
for
love
or
money
;
and
there
's
nayther
love
nor

here

as
I
*NL*
can
see

on

other
folks

love
o

theirselves
,
and
the
money
as
is
to

go

I

there
's
them

the

born
to

--
here
Mrs.
Poyser
paused
*NL*
to
gasp
a
little
--
``
and
I
know
it
's
christened
folks

duty

it

but
I
'll
not

a

myself

wear
myself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Poyser
,
certainly
not
,
''
said
the
squire
,
still
*NL*
confident
in
his
own
powers
of
persuasion
,
``
you
must
not
overwork
*NL*
yourself
;
but
do
n't
you
think
your
work
will
rather
be
lessened
than
*NL*
increased
in
this
way
?
There
is
so
much
milk
required
at
the
Abbey
*NL*
that
you
will
have
little
increase
of
cheese
and
butter
making
from
*NL*
the
addition
to
your
dairy
;
and
I
believe
selling
the
milk
is
the
most
*NL*
profitable
way
of
disposing
of
dairy
produce
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
that
's
true
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
unable
to
repress
an
opinion
on
a
*NL*
question
of
farming
profits
,
and
forgetting
that
it
was
not
in
this
case
*NL*
a
purely
abstract
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
bitterly
,
turning
her
head
half-way
*NL*
towards
her
husband
and
looking
at
the
vacant
arm-chair
--
``
I
daresay
*NL*
it
's
true
for
men
as
sit
i

make

*NL*
everything
's
cut
wi
'
ins
an

outs
to
fit
int

everything

If
you
*NL*
could
make
a
pudding
wi
'
thinking
o

the
batter
,
it
`
ud
be
easy
getting
*NL*
dinner

How
do
I
know
whether
the
milk

be
wanted
constant
?
What
's
*NL*
to
make
me
sure
as
the
house
wo

be
put
o

board
wage
afore
we

many

and
then
I
may
have
to
lie
awake

twenty
*NL*
gallons
o

milk
on
my
mind

Dingall

must
fat

buy
'em

lose
half
of

there

I

there

*NL*
``
That

about
the
fetching

you

not
have

*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
''
said
the
squire
,
who
thought
that
this
entrance
into
*NL*
particulars
indicated
a
distant
inclination
to
compromise
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
's
part

``
Bethell

do
that
regularly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Poyser

said
the
squire
,
shifting
his
tactics
and
looking
as
if
*NL*
he
thought
Mrs.
Poyser
had
suddenly
withdrawn
from
the
proceedings
and
*NL*
left
the
room
,

*NL*
To
be
thrust
out
of

discussion
in
this
way
would
have
been
enough
to
*NL*
complete
Mrs.
Poyser
's
exasperation

even
without
the
final
threat

*NL*
Her
husband
,
really
alarmed
at
the
possibility
of
their
leaving
the
old
*NL*
place
where
he
had
been
bred
and
born
--
for
he
believed
the
old
squire
*NL*
had
small
spite
enough
for
anything
--
was
beginning
a
mild
remonstrance
*NL*
explanatory
of
the
inconvenience
he
should
find
in
having
to
buy
and
*NL*
sell
more
stock

with
,
``
Well

I
think
as

when
*NL*
Mrs.

burst
in
with
the
desperate
determination
to
have
her
say
*NL*
out
this
once
,
though
it
were
to
rain
notices
to
quit

the
only

shelter
were
the
work-house

a

up

far
from
him
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
suspected
that
sour
old
John
was
grinning
behind
him
--
which
was
also
*NL*
the
fact
.
Meanwhile
the
bull-dog
,
the
black-and-tan
terrier
,
Alick
's
*NL*
sheep-dog
,
and
the
gander
hissing
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
pony
's
*NL*
heels
carried
out
the
idea
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
solo
in
an
impressive
*NL*
quartet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
however
,
had
no
sooner
seen
the
pony
move
off
than
she
*NL*
turned
round
,
gave
the
two
hilarious
damsels
a
look
which
drove
them
*NL*
into
the
back
kitchen
,
and
unspearing
her
knitting
,
began
to
knit
again
*NL*
with
her
usual
rapidity
as
she
re-entered
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
`
st
done
it
now
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
a
little
alarmed
and
uneasy
,
but
*NL*
not
without
some
triumphant
amusement
at
his
wife
's
outbreak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
I
've
done
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
;
``
but
I
've
had
my
say
out

I
shall

There
's

up

repent
saying
what
I

if
I

to

's

to

hopeful

of
an
embarrassment
which
had
been
brought
about

*NL*
*NL*
``

none

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
rising
from
his
*NL*
three-cornered
chair
and
walking
slowly
towards
the
door
;
``

I
should
*NL*
be
loath

THE
barley
was
all
carried
at
last
,
and
the
harvest
suppers
went
by
*NL*
without
waiting
for
the
dismal
black
crop
of
beans
.
The
apples
and
*NL*
nuts
were
gathered
and
stored
;
the
scent
of
whey
departed
from
the
*NL*
farm-houses
,
and
the
scent
of
brewing
came
in
its
stead
.
The
woods
*NL*
behind
the
Chase
,
and
all
the
hedgerow
trees
,
took
on
a
solemn
splendour
*NL*
under
the
dark
low-hanging
skies
.
Michaelmas
was
come
,
with
its
fragrant
*NL*
basketfuls
of
purple
damsons
,
and
its
paler
purple
daisies
,
and
its
*NL*
lads
and
lasses
leaving
or
seeking
service
and
winding
along
between
*NL*
the
yellow
hedges
,
with
their
bundles
under
their
arms
.
But
though
*NL*
Michaelmas
was
come
,
Mr.
Thurle
,
that
desirable
tenant
,
did
not
come
to
*NL*
the
Chase
Farm
,
and
the
old
squire
,
after
all
,
had
been
obliged
to
put
*NL*
in
a
new
bailiff
.
It
was
known
throughout
the
two
parishes
that
the
*NL*
squire
's
plan
had
been
frustrated
because
the
Poysers
had
refused
to
*NL*
be
``
put
upon
,
''
and
Mrs.
Poyser
's
outbreak
was
discussed
in
all
*NL*
the
farm-houses
with
a
zest
which
was
only
heightened
by
frequent
*NL*
repetition
.
The
news
that
``
Bony
''
was
come
back
from
Egypt
was
*NL*
comparatively
insipid
,
and
the
repulse
of
the
French
in
Italy
was
*NL*
nothing
to
Mrs.
Poyser
's
repulse
of
the
old
squire
.
Mr.
Irwine
had
heard
*NL*
a
version
of
it
in
every
parishioner
's
house
,
with
the
one
exception
of
*NL*
the
Chase
.
But
since
he
had
always
,
with
marvellous
skill
,
avoided
any
*NL*
quarrel
with
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
laughing
at
the
old
gentleman
's
discomfiture
with
any
one
besides
his
*NL*
mother
,
who
declared
that
if
she
were
rich
she
should
like
to
allow
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
a
pension
for
life
,
and
wanted
to
invite
her
to
the
parsonage
*NL*
that
she
might
hear
an
account
of
the
scene
from
Mrs.
Poyser
's
own
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Mother
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
;
``
it
was
a
little
bit
of
irregular
*NL*
justice
on
Mrs.
Poyser
's
part
,
but
a
magistrate
like
me
must
not
*NL*
countenance
irregular
justice
.
There
must
be
no
report
spread
that
I
*NL*
have
taken
notice
of
the
quarrel
,
else
I
shall
lose
the
little
good
*NL*
influence
I
have
over
the
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
that
woman
even
better
than
her
cream-cheeses
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Irwine
.
``
She
has
the
spirit
of
three
men
,
with
that
pale
face
of
hers
.
*NL*
And
she
says
such
sharp
things
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sharp
!
Yes
,
her
tongue
is
like
a
new-set
razor
.
She
's
quite
original
*NL*
in
her
talk
too
;
one
of
those
untaught
wits
that
help
to
stock
a
country
*NL*
with
proverbs
.
I
told
you
that
capital
thing
I
heard
her
say
about
*NL*
Craig
--
that
he
was
like
a
cock
,
who
thought
the
sun
had
risen
to
hear
*NL*
him
crow
.
Now
that
's
an
AEsop
's
fable
in
a
sentence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
will
be
a
bad
business
if
the
old
gentleman
turns
them
out
of
*NL*
the
farm
next
Michaelmas
,
eh
?
''
said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
must
not
be
;
and
Poyser
is
such
a
good
tenant
that
Donnithorne
*NL*
is
likely
to
think
twice
,
and
digest
his
spleen
rather
than
turn
them
*NL*
out
.
But
if
he
should
give
them
notice
at
Lady
Day
,
Arthur
and
I
must
*NL*
move
heaven
and
earth
to
mollify
him
.
Such
old
parishioners
as
they
are
*NL*
must
not
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
before
Lady
day
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Irwine
.
``
It
struck
me
on
Arthur
's
birthday
that
the
old
man
was
a
little
*NL*
shaken
:
he
's
eighty-three
,
you
know
.
It
's
really
an
unconscionable
age
.
*NL*
It
's
only
women
who
have
a
right
to
live
as
long
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
've
got
old-bachelor
sons
who
would
be
forlorn
without
them
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
laughing
,
and
kissing
his
mother
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
,
too
,
met
her
husband
's
occasional
forebodings
of
a
notice
*NL*
to
quit
with
``
There
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
before
Lady
day
''
--
one
*NL*
of
those
undeniable
general
propositions
which
are
usually
intended
to
*NL*
convey
a
particular
meaning
very
far
from
undeniable
.
But
it
is
really
*NL*
too
hard
upon
human
nature
that
it
should
be
held
a
criminal
offence
to
*NL*
imagine
the
death
even
of
the
king
when
he
is
turned
eighty-three
.
It
is
*NL*
not
to
be
believed
that
any
but
the
dullest
Britons
can
be
good
subjects
*NL*
under
that
hard
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
this
foreboding
,
things
went
on
much
as
usual
in
the
Poyser
*NL*
household
.
Mrs.
Poyser
thought
she
noticed
a
surprising
improvement
*NL*
in
Hetty
.
To
be
sure
,
the
girl
got
``
closer
tempered
,
and
sometimes
she
*NL*
seemed
as
if
there
'd
be
no
drawing
a
word
from
her
with
cart-ropes
,
''
*NL*
but
she
thought
much
less
about
her
dress
,
and
went
after
the
work
quite
*NL*
eagerly
,
without
any
telling
.
And
it
was
wonderful
how
she
never
wanted
*NL*
to
go
out
now
--
indeed
,
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
go
;
and
she
bore
*NL*
her
aunt
's
putting
a
stop
to
her
weekly
lesson
in
fine-work
at
the
Chase
*NL*
without
the
least
grumbling
or
pouting
.
It
must
be
,
after
all
,
that
she
*NL*
had
set
her
heart
on
Adam
at
last
,
and
her
sudden
freak
of
wanting
to
*NL*
be
a
lady
's
maid
must
have
been
caused
by
some
little
pique
or
*NL*
misunderstanding
between
them
,
which
had
passed
by
.
For
whenever
Adam
*NL*
came
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
seemed
to
be
in
better
spirits
and
to
talk
*NL*
more
than
at
other
times
,
though
she
was
almost
sullen
when
Mr.
Craig
or
*NL*
any
other
admirer
happened
to
pay
a
visit
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
himself
watched
her
at
first
with
trembling
anxiety
,
which
gave
*NL*
way
to
surprise
and
delicious
hope
.
Five
days
after
delivering
Arthur
's
*NL*
letter
,
he
had
ventured
to
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
again
--
not
without
*NL*
dread
lest
the
sight
of
him
might
be
painful
to
her
.
She
was
not
in
the
*NL*
house-place
when
he
entered
,
and
he
sat
talking
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
with
a
heavy
fear
on
his
heart
that
they
might
*NL*
presently
tell
him
Hetty
was
ill
.
But
by
and
by
there
came
a
light
step
*NL*
that
he
knew
,
and
when
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
``
Come
,
Hetty
,
where
have
you
*NL*
been
?
''
Adam
was
obliged
to
turn
round
,
though
he
was
afraid
to
see
the
*NL*
changed
look
there
must
be
in
her
face
.
He
almost
started
when
he
saw
*NL*
her
smiling
as
if
she
were
pleased
to
see
him
--
looking
the
same
as
ever
*NL*
at
a
first
glance
,
only
that
she
had
her
cap
on
,
which
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
her
in
before
when
he
came
of
an
evening
.
Still
,
when
he
looked
at
*NL*
her
again
and
again
as
she
moved
about
or
sat
at
her
work
,
there
was
a
*NL*
change
:
the
cheeks
were
as
pink
as
ever
,
and
she
smiled
as
much
as
she
*NL*
had
ever
done
of
late
,
but
there
was
something
different
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
in
the
expression
of
her
face
,
in
all
her
movements
,
Adam
*NL*
thought
--
something
harder
,
older
,
less
child-like
.
``
Poor
thing
!
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
``
that
's
allays
likely
.
It
's
because
she
's
had
her
first
*NL*
heartache
.
But
she
's
got
a
spirit
to
bear
up
under
it
.
Thank
God
for
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
weeks
went
by
,
and
he
saw
her
always
looking
pleased
to
see
*NL*
him
--
turning
up
her
lovely
face
towards
him
as
if
she
meant
him
to
*NL*
understand
that
she
was
glad
for
him
to
come
--
and
going
about
her
work
*NL*
in
the
same
equable
way
,
making
no
sign
of
sorrow
,
he
began
to
believe
*NL*
that
her
feeling
towards
Arthur
must
have
been
much
slighter
than
he
had
*NL*
imagined
in
his
first
indignation
and
alarm
,
and
that
she
had
been
able
*NL*
to
think
of
her
girlish
fancy
that
Arthur
was
in
love
with
her
and
would
*NL*
marry
her
as
a
folly
of
which
she
was
timely
cured
.
And
it
perhaps
was
,
*NL*
as
he
had
sometimes
in
his
more
cheerful
moments
hoped
it
would
be
--
her
*NL*
heart
was
really
turning
with
all
the
more
warmth
towards
the
man
she
*NL*
knew
to
have
a
serious
love
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Possibly
you
think
that
Adam
was
not
at
all
sagacious
in
his
*NL*
interpretations
,
and
that
it
was
altogether
extremely
unbecoming
in
a
*NL*
sensible
man
to
behave
as
he
did
--
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
who
really
*NL*
had
nothing
more
than
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
,
attributing
imaginary
*NL*
virtues
to
her
,
and
even
condescending
to
cleave
to
her
after
she
had
*NL*
fallen
in
love
with
another
man
,
waiting
for
her
kind
looks
as
a
patient
*NL*
trembling
dog
waits
for
his
master
's
eye
to
be
turned
upon
him
.
But
in
*NL*
so
complex
a
thing
as
human
nature
,
we
must
consider
,
it
is
hard
to
find
*NL*
rules
without
exceptions
.
Of
course
,
I
know
that
,
as
a
rule
,
sensible
*NL*
men
fall
in
love
with
the
most
sensible
women
of
their
acquaintance
,
*NL*
see
through
all
the
pretty
deceits
of
coquettish
beauty
,
never
imagine
*NL*
themselves
loved
when
they
are
not
loved
,
cease
loving
on
all
*NL*
proper
occasions
,
and
marry
the
woman
most
fitted
for
them
in
every
*NL*
respect
--
indeed
,
so
as
to
compel
the
approbation
of
all
the
maiden
*NL*
ladies
in
their
neighbourhood
.
But
even
to
this
rule
an
exception
will
*NL*
occur
now
and
then
in
the
lapse
of
centuries
,
and
my
friend
Adam
was
*NL*
one
.
For
my
own
part
,
however
,
I
respect
him
none
the
less
--
nay
,
I
think
*NL*
the
deep
love
he
had
for
that
sweet
,
rounded
,
blossom-like
,
dark-eyed
*NL*
Hetty
,
of
whose
inward
self
he
was
really
very
ignorant
,
came
out
of
the
*NL*
very
strength
of
his
nature
and
not
out
of
any
inconsistent
weakness
.
Is
*NL*
it
any
weakness
,
pray
,
to
be
wrought
on
by
exquisite
music
?
To
feel
its
*NL*
wondrous
harmonies
searching
the
subtlest
windings
of
your
soul
,
the
*NL*
delicate
fibres
of
life
where
no
memory
can
penetrate
,
and
binding
*NL*
together
your
whole
being
past
and
present
in
one
unspeakable
vibration
,
*NL*
melting
you
in
one
moment
with
all
the
tenderness
,
all
the
love
that
has
*NL*
been
scattered
through
the
toilsome
years
,
concentrating
in
one
*NL*
emotion
of
heroic
courage
or
resignation
all
the
hard-learnt
lessons
of
*NL*
self-renouncing
sympathy
,
blending
your
present
joy
with
past
sorrow
and
*NL*
your
present
sorrow
with
all
your
past
joy
?
If
not
,
then
neither
is
it
*NL*
a
weakness
to
be
so
wrought
upon
by
the
exquisite
curves
of
a
woman
's
*NL*
cheek
and
neck
and
arms
,
by
the
liquid
depths
of
her
beseeching
eyes
,
or
*NL*
the
sweet
childish
pout
of
her
lips
.
For
the
beauty
of
a
lovely
woman
is
*NL*
like
music
:
what
can
one
say
more
?
Beauty
has
an
expression
beyond
and
*NL*
far
above
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
it
clothes
,
as
the
words
of
genius
*NL*
have
a
wider
meaning
than
the
thought
that
prompted
them
.
It
is
more
*NL*
than
a
woman
's
love
that
moves
us
in
a
woman
's
eyes
--
it
seems
to
be
a
*NL*
far-off
mighty
love
that
has
come
near
to
us
,
and
made
speech
for
itself
*NL*
there
;
the
rounded
neck
,
the
dimpled
arm
,
move
us
by
something
more
*NL*
than
their
prettiness
--
by
their
close
kinship
with
all
we
have
known
*NL*
of
tenderness
and
peace
.
The
noblest
nature
sees
the
most
of
this
*NL*
impersonal
expression
in
beauty
-LRB-
it
is
needless
to
say
that
there
are
*NL*
gentlemen
with
whiskers
dyed
and
undyed
who
see
none
of
it
whatever
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
for
this
reason
,
the
noblest
nature
is
often
the
most
blinded
to
*NL*
the
character
of
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
the
beauty
clothes
.
Whence
,
I
*NL*
fear
,
the
tragedy
of
human
life
is
likely
to
continue
for
a
long
time
*NL*
to
come
,
in
spite
of
mental
philosophers
who
are
ready
with
the
best
*NL*
receipts
for
avoiding
all
mistakes
of
the
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
good
Adam
had
no
fine
words
into
which
he
could
put
his
feeling
for
*NL*
Hetty
:
he
could
not
disguise
mystery
in
this
way
with
the
appearance
of
*NL*
knowledge
;
he
called
his
love
frankly
a
mystery
,
as
you
have
heard
him
.
*NL*
He
only
knew
that
the
sight
and
memory
of
her
moved
him
deeply
,
touching
*NL*
the
spring
of
all
love
and
tenderness
,
all
faith
and
courage
within
*NL*
him
.
How
could
he
imagine
narrowness
,
selfishness
,
hardness
in
her
?
*NL*
He
created
the
mind
he
believed
in
out
of
his
own
,
which
was
large
,
*NL*
unselfish
,
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hopes
he
felt
about
Hetty
softened
a
little
his
feeling
towards
*NL*
Arthur
.
Surely
his
attentions
to
Hetty
must
have
been
of
a
slight
kind
;
*NL*
they
were
altogether
wrong
,
and
such
as
no
man
in
Arthur
's
position
*NL*
ought
to
have
allowed
himself
,
but
they
must
have
had
an
air
of
*NL*
playfulness
about
them
,
which
had
probably
blinded
him
to
their
danger
*NL*
and
had
prevented
them
from
laying
any
strong
hold
on
Hetty
's
heart
.
As
*NL*
the
new
promise
of
happiness
rose
for
Adam
,
his
indignation
and
jealousy
*NL*
began
to
die
out
.
Hetty
was
not
made
unhappy
;
he
almost
believed
that
*NL*
she
liked
him
best
;
and
the
thought
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
that
the
*NL*
friendship
which
had
once
seemed
dead
for
ever
might
revive
in
the
days
*NL*
to
come
,
and
he
would
not
have
to
say
``
good-bye
''
to
the
grand
old
woods
,
*NL*
but
would
like
them
better
because
they
were
Arthur
's
.
For
this
new
*NL*
promise
of
happiness
following
so
quickly
on
the
shock
of
pain
had
an
*NL*
intoxicating
effect
on
the
sober
Adam
,
who
had
all
his
life
been
used
to
*NL*
much
hardship
and
moderate
hope
.
Was
he
really
going
to
have
an
easy
*NL*
lot
after
all
?
It
seemed
so
,
for
at
the
beginning
of
November
,
Jonathan
*NL*
Burge
,
finding
it
impossible
to
replace
Adam
,
had
at
last
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
,
without
further
condition
*NL*
than
that
he
should
continue
to
give
his
energies
to
it
and
renounce
*NL*
all
thought
of
having
a
separate
business
of
his
own
.
Son-in-law
or
no
*NL*
son-in-law
,
Adam
had
made
himself
too
necessary
to
be
parted
with
,
*NL*
and
his
headwork
was
so
much
more
important
to
Burge
than
his
skill
*NL*
in
handicraft
that
his
having
the
management
of
the
woods
made
little
*NL*
difference
in
the
value
of
his
services
;
and
as
to
the
bargains
about
*NL*
the
squire
's
timber
,
it
would
be
easy
to
call
in
a
third
person
.
Adam
*NL*
saw
here
an
opening
into
a
broadening
path
of
prosperous
work
such
as
he
*NL*
had
thought
of
with
ambitious
longing
ever
since
he
was
a
lad
:
he
might
*NL*
come
to
build
a
bridge
,
or
a
town
hall
,
or
a
factory
,
for
he
had
always
*NL*
said
to
himself
that
Jonathan
Burge
's
building
business
was
like
an
*NL*
acorn
,
which
might
be
the
mother
of
a
great
tree
.
So
he
gave
his
hand
*NL*
to
Burge
on
that
bargain
,
and
went
home
with
his
mind
full
of
happy
*NL*
visions
,
in
which
-LRB-
my
refined
reader
will
perhaps
be
shocked
when
I
*NL*
say
it
-RRB-
the
image
of
Hetty
hovered
,
and
smiled
over
plans
for
seasoning
*NL*
timber
at
a
trifling
expense
,
calculations
as
to
the
cheapening
of
*NL*
bricks
per
thousand
by
water-carriage
,
and
a
favourite
scheme
for
the
*NL*
strengthening
of
roofs
and
walls
with
a
peculiar
form
of
iron
girder
.
*NL*
What
then
?
Adam
's
enthusiasm
lay
in
these
things
;
and
our
love
is
*NL*
inwrought
in
our
enthusiasm
as
electricity
is
inwrought
in
the
air
,
*NL*
exalting
its
power
by
a
subtle
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
would
be
able
to
take
a
separate
house
now
,
and
provide
for
his
*NL*
mother
in
the
old
one
;
his
prospects
would
justify
his
marrying
very
*NL*
soon
,
and
if
Dinah
consented
to
have
Seth
,
their
mother
would
perhaps
*NL*
be
more
contented
to
live
apart
from
Adam
.
But
he
told
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
not
be
hasty
--
he
would
not
try
Hetty
's
feeling
for
him
until
it
*NL*
had
had
time
to
grow
strong
and
firm
.
However
,
tomorrow
,
after
church
,
*NL*
he
would
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
them
the
news
.
Mr.
Poyser
,
he
*NL*
knew
,
would
like
it
better
than
a
five-pound
note
,
and
he
should
see
if
*NL*
Hetty
's
eyes
brightened
at
it
.
The
months
would
be
short
with
all
he
had
*NL*
to
fill
his
mind
,
and
this
foolish
eagerness
which
had
come
over
him
of
*NL*
late
must
not
hurry
him
into
any
premature
words
.
Yet
when
he
got
home
*NL*
and
told
his
mother
the
good
news
,
and
ate
his
supper
,
while
she
sat
*NL*
by
almost
crying
for
joy
and
wanting
him
to
eat
twice
as
much
as
usual
*NL*
because
of
this
good-luck
,
he
could
not
help
preparing
her
gently
for
*NL*
the
coming
change
by
talking
of
the
old
house
being
too
small
for
them
*NL*
all
to
go
on
living
in
it
always
.

Chapter
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Betrothal
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
dry
Sunday
,
and
really
a
pleasant
day
for
the
2d
of
November
.
*NL*
There
was
no
sunshine
,
but
the
clouds
were
high
,
and
the
wind
was
so
*NL*
still
that
the
yellow
leaves
which
fluttered
down
from
the
hedgerow
elms
*NL*
must
have
fallen
from
pure
decay
.
Nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Poyser
did
not
go
*NL*
to
church
,
for
she
had
taken
a
cold
too
serious
to
be
neglected
;
only
*NL*
two
winters
ago
she
had
been
laid
up
for
weeks
with
a
cold
;
and
since
*NL*
his
wife
did
not
go
to
church
,
Mr.
Poyser
considered
that
on
the
whole
*NL*
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
stay
away
too
and
``
keep
her
company
.
''
He
*NL*
could
perhaps
have
given
no
precise
form
to
the
reasons
that
determined
*NL*
this
conclusion
,
but
it
is
well
known
to
all
experienced
minds
that
our
*NL*
firmest
convictions
are
often
dependent
on
subtle
impressions
for
which
*NL*
words
are
quite
too
coarse
a
medium
.
However
it
was
,
no
one
from
the
*NL*
Poyser
family
went
to
church
that
afternoon
except
Hetty
and
the
boys
;
*NL*
yet
Adam
was
bold
enough
to
join
them
after
church
,
and
say
that
he
*NL*
would
walk
home
with
them
,
though
all
the
way
through
the
village
he
*NL*
appeared
to
be
chiefly
occupied
with
Marty
and
Tommy
,
telling
them
about
*NL*
the
squirrels
in
Binton
Coppice
,
and
promising
to
take
them
there
some
*NL*
day
.
But
when
they
came
to
the
fields
he
said
to
the
boys
,
``
Now
,
then
,
*NL*
which
is
the
stoutest
walker
?
Him
as
gets
to
th
'
home-gate
first
shall
*NL*
be
the
first
to
go
with
me
to
Binton
Coppice
on
the
donkey
.
But
Tommy
*NL*
must
have
the
start
up
to
the
next
stile
,
because
he
's
the
smallest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
never
behaved
so
much
like
a
determined
lover
before
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
the
boys
had
both
set
off
,
he
looked
down
at
Hetty
and
said
,
``
Wo
n't
*NL*
you
hang
on
my
arm
,
Hetty
?
''
in
a
pleading
tone
,
as
if
he
had
already
*NL*
asked
her
and
she
had
refused
.
Hetty
looked
up
at
him
smilingly
and
put
*NL*
her
round
arm
through
his
in
a
moment
.
It
was
nothing
to
her
,
putting
*NL*
her
arm
through
Adam
's
,
but
she
knew
he
cared
a
great
deal
about
having
*NL*
her
arm
through
his
,
and
she
wished
him
to
care
.
Her
heart
beat
no
*NL*
faster
,
and
she
looked
at
the
half-bare
hedgerows
and
the
ploughed
field
*NL*
with
the
same
sense
of
oppressive
dulness
as
before
.
But
Adam
scarcely
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
walking
.
He
thought
Hetty
must
know
that
he
was
*NL*
pressing
her
arm
a
little
--
a
very
little
.
Words
rushed
to
his
lips
that
*NL*
he
dared
not
utter
--
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
utter
yet
--
and
*NL*
so
he
was
silent
for
the
length
of
that
field
.
The
calm
patience
*NL*
with
which
he
had
once
waited
for
Hetty
's
love
,
content
only
with
her
*NL*
presence
and
the
thought
of
the
future
,
had
forsaken
him
since
that
*NL*
terrible
shock
nearly
three
months
ago
.
The
agitations
of
jealousy
had
*NL*
given
a
new
restlessness
to
his
passion
--
had
made
fear
and
uncertainty
*NL*
too
hard
almost
to
bear
.
But
though
he
might
not
speak
to
Hetty
of
his
*NL*
love
,
he
would
tell
her
about
his
new
prospects
and
see
if
she
would
be
*NL*
pleased
.
So
when
he
was
enough
master
of
himself
to
talk
,
he
said
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
tell
your
uncle
some
news
that
'll
surprise
him
,
Hetty
;
and
I
*NL*
think
he
'll
be
glad
to
hear
it
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
Hetty
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
Burge
has
offered
me
a
share
in
his
business
,
and
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
change
in
Hetty
's
face
,
certainly
not
produced
by
any
*NL*
agreeable
impression
from
this
news
.
In
fact
she
felt
a
momentary
*NL*
annoyance
and
alarm
,
for
she
had
so
often
heard
it
hinted
by
her
uncle
*NL*
that
Adam
might
have
Mary
Burge
and
a
share
in
the
business
any
day
,
*NL*
if
he
liked
,
that
she
associated
the
two
objects
now
,
and
the
thought
*NL*
immediately
occurred
that
perhaps
Adam
had
given
her
up
because
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
lately
,
and
had
turned
towards
Mary
Burge
.
With
that
*NL*
thought
,
and
before
she
had
time
to
remember
any
reasons
why
it
could
*NL*
not
be
true
,
came
a
new
sense
of
forsakenness
and
disappointment
.
The
*NL*
one
thing
--
the
one
person
--
her
mind
had
rested
on
in
its
dull
weariness
,
*NL*
had
slipped
away
from
her
,
and
peevish
misery
filled
her
eyes
with
*NL*
tears
.
She
was
looking
on
the
ground
,
but
Adam
saw
her
face
,
saw
the
*NL*
tears
,
and
before
he
had
finished
saying
,
``
Hetty
,
dear
Hetty
,
what
*NL*
are
you
crying
for
?
''
his
eager
rapid
thought
had
flown
through
all
the
*NL*
causes
conceivable
to
him
,
and
had
at
last
alighted
on
half
the
true
*NL*
one
.
Hetty
thought
he
was
going
to
marry
Mary
Burge
--
she
did
n't
like
him
*NL*
to
marry
--
perhaps
she
did
n't
like
him
to
marry
any
one
but
herself
?
All
*NL*
caution
was
swept
away
--
all
reason
for
it
was
gone
,
and
Adam
could
feel
*NL*
nothing
but
trembling
joy
.
He
leaned
towards
her
and
took
her
hand
,
as
*NL*
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
afford
to
be
married
now
,
Hetty
--
I
could
make
a
wife
*NL*
comfortable
;
but
I
shall
never
want
to
be
married
if
you
wo
n't
have
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
through
her
tears
,
as
she
had
done
to
*NL*
Arthur
that
first
evening
in
the
wood
,
when
she
had
thought
he
was
not
*NL*
coming
,
and
yet
he
came
.
It
was
a
feebler
relief
,
a
feebler
triumph
she
*NL*
felt
now
,
but
the
great
dark
eyes
and
the
sweet
lips
were
as
beautiful
*NL*
as
ever
,
perhaps
more
beautiful
,
for
there
was
a
more
luxuriant
*NL*
womanliness
about
Hetty
of
late
.
Adam
could
hardly
believe
in
the
*NL*
happiness
of
that
moment
.
His
right
hand
held
her
left
,
and
he
pressed
*NL*
her
arm
close
against
his
heart
as
he
leaned
down
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
love
me
,
Hetty
?
Will
you
be
my
own
wife
,
to
love
and
take
*NL*
care
of
as
long
as
I
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
did
not
speak
,
but
Adam
's
face
was
very
close
to
hers
,
and
she
*NL*
put
up
her
round
cheek
against
his
,
like
a
kitten
.
She
wanted
to
be
*NL*
caressed
--
she
wanted
to
feel
as
if
Arthur
were
with
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
cared
for
no
words
after
that
,
and
they
hardly
spoke
through
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
walk
.
He
only
said
,
``
I
may
tell
your
uncle
and
aunt
,
may
n't
*NL*
I
,
Hetty
?
''
and
she
said
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
fire-light
on
the
hearth
at
the
Hall
Farm
shone
on
joyful
faces
*NL*
that
evening
,
when
Hetty
was
gone
upstairs
and
Adam
took
the
opportunity
*NL*
of
telling
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
that
he
saw
his
way
*NL*
to
maintaining
a
wife
now
,
and
that
Hetty
had
consented
to
have
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
no
objections
against
me
for
her
husband
,
''
said
Adam
;
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
poor
man
as
yet
,
but
she
shall
want
nothing
as
I
can
work
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Objections
?
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
while
the
grandfather
leaned
forward
and
*NL*
brought
out
his
long
``
Nay
,
nay
.
''
``
What
objections
can
we
ha
'
to
you
,
*NL*
lad
?
Never
mind
your
being
poorish
as
yet
;
there
's
money
in
your
*NL*
head-piece
as
there
's
money

the
sown

it
must
ha

*NL*
You
'n
got
enough
to
begin
on
,
and
we
can
do
a
deal

the
bit

furniture
you
'll
want

Thee
`
st
got
feathers
and
linen
to
spare
--
plenty
,
*NL*
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
was
of
course
addressed
to
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
wrapped
up
*NL*
in
a
warm
shawl
and
was
too
hoarse
to
speak
with
her
usual
facility
.
*NL*
At
first
she
only
nodded
emphatically
,
but
she
was
presently
unable
to
*NL*
resist
the
temptation
to
be
more
explicit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ud
be
a
poor
tale
if
I
hadna
feathers
and
linen
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
hoarsely
,
``
when
I
never
sell
a
fowl
but
what
's
plucked
,
and
the
wheel
's
*NL*
a-going
every
day
o
'
the
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
wench
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
when
Hetty
came
down
,
``
come
and
kiss
*NL*
us
,
and
let
us
wish
you
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
went
very
quietly
and
kissed
the
big
good-natured
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
he
said
,
patting
her
on
the
back
,
``
go
and
kiss
your
aunt
and
*NL*
your
grandfather
.
I
'm
as
wishful
t
'
have
you
settled
well
as
if
you
was
*NL*
my
own
daughter
;
and
so
's
your
aunt
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
for
she
's
done
by
*NL*
you
this
seven
`
ear
,
Hetty
,
as
if
you
'd
been
her
own
.
Come
,
come
,
now
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
becoming
jocose
,
as
soon
as
Hetty
had
kissed
her
aunt
and
*NL*
the
old
man
,
``
Adam
wants
a
kiss
too
,
I
'll
warrant
,
and
he
's
a
right
to
*NL*
one
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
turned
away
,
smiling
,
towards
her
empty
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Adam
,
then
,
take
one
,
''
persisted
Mr.
Poyser
,
``
else
y
'
arena
half
*NL*
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
got
up
,
blushing
like
a
small
maiden
--
great
strong
fellow
as
he
*NL*
was
--
and
,
putting
his
arm
round
Hetty
stooped
down
and
gently
kissed
her
*NL*
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pretty
scene
in
the
red
fire-light
;
for
there
were
no
*NL*
candles
--
why
should
there
be
,
when
the
fire
was
so
bright
and
was
*NL*
reflected
from
all
the
pewter
and
the
polished
oak
?
No
one
wanted
to
*NL*
work
on
a
Sunday
evening
.
Even
Hetty
felt
something
like
contentment
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
all
this
love
.
Adam
's
attachment
to
her
,
Adam
's
caress
,
*NL*
stirred
no
passion
in
her
,
were
no
longer
enough
to
satisfy
her
vanity
,
*NL*
but
they
were
the
best
her
life
offered
her
now
--
they
promised
her
some
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
before
Adam
went
away
,
about
the
*NL*
possibility
of
his
finding
a
house
that
would
do
for
him
to
settle
in
.
*NL*
No
house
was
empty
except
the
one
next
to
Will
Maskery
's
in
the
village
,
*NL*
and
that
was
too
small
for
Adam
now
.
Mr.
Poyser
insisted
that
the
best
*NL*
plan
would
be
for
Seth
and
his
mother
to
move
and
leave
Adam
in
the
old
*NL*
home
,
which
might
be
enlarged
after
a
while
,
for
there
was
plenty
of
*NL*
space
in
the
woodyard
and
garden
;
but
Adam
objected
to
turning
his
*NL*
mother
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
at
last
,
``
we
needna
fix
everything
*NL*
to-night
.
We
must
take
time
to
consider
.
You
canna
think
o
'
getting
*NL*
married
afore
Easter
.
I
'm
not
for
long
courtships
,
but
there
must
be
a
*NL*
bit
o
'
time
to
make
things
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
``
Christian
*NL*
folks
ca
n't
be
married
like
cuckoos
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
bit
daunted
,
though
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
``
when
I
think
as
we
may
*NL*
have
notice
to
quit

and

be
forced
to
take

twenty
mile
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
staring
at
the
floor
and
lifting
his
hands
up
*NL*
and
down
,
while
his
arms
rested
on
the
elbows
of
his
chair
,
``
it
's
a

he
added
,
looking
up
at
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

fret
beforehand

said
Martin
the

Chapter
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hidden
Dread
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
busy
time
for
Adam
--
the
time
between
the
beginning
of
November
*NL*
and
the
beginning
of
February
,
and
he
could
see
little
of
Hetty
,
except
*NL*
on
Sundays
.
But
a
happy
time
,
nevertheless
,
for
it
was
taking
him
nearer
*NL*
and
nearer
to
March
,
when
they
were
to
be
married
,
and
all
the
little
*NL*
preparations
for
their
new
housekeeping
marked
the
progress
towards
the
*NL*
longed-for
day
.
Two
new
rooms
had
been
``
run
up
''
to
the
old
house
,
for
*NL*
his
mother
and
Seth
were
to
live
with
them
after
all
.
Lisbeth
had
cried
*NL*
so
piteously
at
the
thought
of
leaving
Adam
that
he
had
gone
to
Hetty
*NL*
and
asked
her
if
,
for
the
love
of
him
,
she
would
put
up
with
his
*NL*
mother
's
ways
and
consent
to
live
with
her
.
To
his
great
delight
,
Hetty
*NL*
said
,
``
Yes
;
I
'd
as
soon
she
lived
with
us
as
not
.
''
Hetty
's
mind
was
*NL*
oppressed
at
that
moment
with
a
worse
difficulty
than
poor
Lisbeth
's
*NL*
ways
;
she
could
not
care
about
them
.
So
Adam
was
consoled
for
the
*NL*
disappointment
he
had
felt
when
Seth
had
come
back
from
his
visit
to
*NL*
Snowfield
and
said
``
it
was
no
use
--
Dinah
's
heart
wasna
turned
towards
*NL*
marrying
.
''
For
when
he
told
his
mother
that
Hetty
was
willing
they
*NL*
should
all
live
together
and
there
was
no
more
need
of
them
to
think
of
*NL*
parting
,
she
said
,
in
a
more
contented
tone
than
he
had
heard
her
speak
*NL*
in
since
it
had
been
settled
that
he
was
to
be
married
,
``
Eh
,
my
lad
,
*NL*
I
'll
be
as
still
as
th
'
ould
tabby
,
an
'
ne'er
want
to
do
aught
but
*NL*
th
'
offal
work
,
as
she
wonna
like
t
'
do
.
An
'
then
we
needna
part
the
*NL*
platters
an
'
things
,
as
ha
'
stood
on
the
shelf
together
sin
'
afore
thee
*NL*
wast
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
cloud
that
now
and
then
came
across
Adam
's
sunshine
:
*NL*
Hetty
seemed
unhappy
sometimes
.
But
to
all
his
anxious
,
tender
*NL*
questions
,
she
replied
with
an
assurance
that
she
was
quite
contented
*NL*
and
wished
nothing
different
;
and
the
next
time
he
saw
her
she
was
more
*NL*
lively
than
usual
.
It
might
be
that
she
was
a
little
overdone
with
work
*NL*
and
anxiety
now
,
for
soon
after
Christmas
Mrs.
Poyser
had
taken
another
*NL*
cold
,
which
had
brought
on
inflammation
,
and
this
illness
had
confined
*NL*
her
to
her
room
all
through
January
.
Hetty
had
to
manage
everything
*NL*
downstairs
,
and
half-supply
Molly
's
place
too
,
while
that
good
damsel
*NL*
waited
on
her
mistress
,
and
she
seemed
to
throw
herself
so
entirely
into
*NL*
her
new
functions
,
working
with
a
grave
steadiness
which
was
new
in
her
,
*NL*
that
Mr.
Poyser
often
told
Adam
she
was
wanting
to
show
him
what
a
*NL*
good
housekeeper
he
would
have
;
but
he
``
doubted
the
lass
was
o'erdoing
*NL*
it
--
she
must
have
a
bit
o
'
rest
when
her
aunt
could
come
downstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
desirable
event
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
coming
downstairs
happened
in
the
*NL*
early
part
of
February
,
when
some
mild
weather
thawed
the
last
patch
of
*NL*
snow
on
the
Binton
Hills
.
On
one
of
these
days
,
soon
after
her
aunt
came
*NL*
down
,
Hetty
went
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
of
the
wedding
things
which
*NL*
were
wanting
,
and
which
Mrs.
Poyser
had
scolded
her
for
neglecting
,
*NL*
observing
that
she
supposed
``
it
was
because
they
were
not
for
th
'
*NL*
outside
,
else
she
'd
ha
'
bought
'em
fast
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
when
Hetty
set
off
,
and
the
slight
hoar-frost
*NL*
that
had
whitened
the
hedges
in
the
early
morning
had
disappeared
as
*NL*
the
sun
mounted
the
cloudless
sky
.
Bright
February
days
have
a
stronger
*NL*
charm
of
hope
about
them
than
any
other
days
in
the
year
.
One
likes
*NL*
to
pause
in
the
mild
rays
of
the
sun
,
and
look
over
the
gates
at
the
*NL*
patient
plough-horses
turning
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
,
and
think
that
*NL*
the
beautiful
year
is
all
before
one
.
The
birds
seem
to
feel
just
the
*NL*
same
:
their
notes
are
as
clear
as
the
clear
air
.
There
are
no
leaves
on
*NL*
the
trees
and
hedgerows
,
but
how
green
all
the
grassy
fields
are
!
And
*NL*
the
dark
purplish
brown
of
the
ploughed
earth
and
of
the
bare
branches
*NL*
is
beautiful
too
.
What
a
glad
world
this
looks
like
,
as
one
drives
or
*NL*
rides
along
the
valleys
and
over
the
hills
!
I
have
often
thought
so
*NL*
when
,
in
foreign
countries
,
where
the
fields
and
woods
have
looked
to
me
*NL*
like
our
English
Loamshire
--
the
rich
land
tilled
with
just
as
much
care
,
*NL*
the
woods
rolling
down
the
gentle
slopes
to
the
green
meadows
--
I
have
*NL*
come
on
something
by
the
roadside
which
has
reminded
me
that
I
am
not
*NL*
in
Loamshire
:
an
image
of
a
great
agony
--
the
agony
of
the
Cross
.
It
has
*NL*
stood
perhaps
by
the
clustering
apple-blossoms
,
or
in
the
broad
sunshine
*NL*
by
the
cornfield
,
or
at
a
turning
by
the
wood
where
a
clear
brook
was
*NL*
gurgling
below
;
and
surely
,
if
there
came
a
traveller
to
this
world
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
the
story
of
man
's
life
upon
it
,
this
image
of
agony
*NL*
would
seem
to
him
strangely
out
of
place
in
the
midst
of
this
joyous
*NL*
nature
.
He
would
not
know
that
hidden
behind
the
apple-blossoms
,
or
*NL*
among
the
golden
corn
,
or
under
the
shrouding
boughs
of
the
wood
,
there
*NL*
might
be
a
human
heart
beating
heavily
with
anguish
--
perhaps
a
young
*NL*
blooming
girl
,
not
knowing
where
to
turn
for
refuge
from
swift-advancing
*NL*
shame
,
understanding
no
more
of
this
life
of
ours
than
a
foolish
lost
*NL*
lamb
wandering
farther
and
farther
in
the
nightfall
on
the
lonely
heath
,
*NL*
yet
tasting
the
bitterest
of
life
's
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
things
are
sometimes
hidden
among
the
sunny
fields
and
behind
the
*NL*
blossoming
orchards
;
and
the
sound
of
the
gurgling
brook
,
if
you
came
*NL*
close
to
one
spot
behind
a
small
bush
,
would
be
mingled
for
your
ear
*NL*
with
a
despairing
human
sob
.
No
wonder
man
's
religion
has
much
sorrow
in
*NL*
it
:
no
wonder
he
needs
a
suffering
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
,
in
her
red
cloak
and
warm
bonnet
,
with
her
basket
in
her
hand
,
is
*NL*
turning
towards
a
gate
by
the
side
of
the
Treddleston
road
,
but
not
that
*NL*
she
may
have
a
more
lingering
enjoyment
of
the
sunshine
and
think
*NL*
with
hope
of
the
long
unfolding
year
.
She
hardly
knows
that
the
sun
is
*NL*
shining
;
and
for
weeks
,
now
,
when
she
has
hoped
at
all
,
it
has
been
for
*NL*
something
at
which
she
herself
trembles
and
shudders
.
She
only
wants
to
*NL*
be
out
of
the
high-road
,
that
she
may
walk
slowly
and
not
care
how
her
*NL*
face
looks
,
as
she
dwells
on
wretched
thoughts
;
and
through
this
gate
*NL*
she
can
get
into
a
field-path
behind
the
wide
thick
hedgerows
.
Her
great
*NL*
dark
eyes
wander
blankly
over
the
fields
like
the
eyes
of
one
who
is
*NL*
desolate
,
homeless
,
unloved
,
not
the
promised
bride
of
a
brave
tender
*NL*
man
.
But
there
are
no
tears
in
them
:
her
tears
were
all
wept
away
in
*NL*
the
weary
night
,
before
she
went
to
sleep
.
At
the
next
stile
the
pathway
*NL*
branches
off
:
there
are
two
roads
before
her
--
one
along
by
the
hedgerow
,
*NL*
which
will
by
and
by
lead
her
into
the
road
again
,
the
other
across
*NL*
the
fields
,
which
will
take
her
much
farther
out
of
the
way
into
the
*NL*
Scantlands
,
low
shrouded
pastures
where
she
will
see
nobody
.
She
chooses
*NL*
this
and
begins
to
walk
a
little
faster
,
as
if
she
had
suddenly
thought
*NL*
of
an
object
towards
which
it
was
worth
while
to
hasten
.
Soon
she
is
in
*NL*
the
Scantlands
,
where
the
grassy
land
slopes
gradually
downwards
,
and
*NL*
she
leaves
the
level
ground
to
follow
the
slope
.
Farther
on
there
is
a
*NL*
clump
of
trees
on
the
low
ground
,
and
she
is
making
her
way
towards
it
.
*NL*
No
,
it
is
not
a
clump
of
trees
,
but
a
dark
shrouded
pool
,
so
full
with
*NL*
the
wintry
rains
that
the
under
boughs
of
the
elder-bushes
lie
low
*NL*
beneath
the
water
.
She
sits
down
on
the
grassy
bank
,
against
the
*NL*
stooping
stem
of
the
great
oak
that
hangs
over
the
dark
pool
.
She
has
*NL*
thought
of
this
pool
often
in
the
nights
of
the
month
that
has
just
gone
*NL*
by
,
and
now
at
last
she
is
come
to
see
it
.
She
clasps
her
hands
round
*NL*
her
knees
,
and
leans
forward
,
and
looks
earnestly
at
it
,
as
if
trying
to
*NL*
guess
what
sort
of
bed
it
would
make
for
her
young
round
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
has
not
courage
to
jump
into
that
cold
watery
bed
,
and
if
*NL*
she
had
,
they
might
find
her
--
they
might
find
out
why
she
had
drowned
*NL*
herself
.
There
is
but
one
thing
left
to
her
:
she
must
go
away
,
go
where
*NL*
they
ca
n't
find
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
on-coming
of
her
great
dread
,
some
weeks
after
her
*NL*
betrothal
to
Adam
,
she
had
waited
and
waited
,
in
the
blind
vague
hope
*NL*
that
something
would
happen
to
set
her
free
from
her
terror
;
but
she
*NL*
could
wait
no
longer
.
All
the
force
of
her
nature
had
been
concentrated
*NL*
on
the
one
effort
of
concealment
,
and
she
had
shrunk
with
irresistible
*NL*
dread
from
every
course
that
could
tend
towards
a
betrayal
of
her
*NL*
miserable
secret
.
Whenever
the
thought
of
writing
to
Arthur
had
occurred
*NL*
to
her
,
she
had
rejected
it
.
He
could
do
nothing
for
her
that
would
*NL*
shelter
her
from
discovery
and
scorn
among
the
relatives
and
neighbours
*NL*
who
once
more
made
all
her
world
,
now
her
airy
dream
had
vanished
.
Her
*NL*
imagination
no
longer
saw
happiness
with
Arthur
,
for
he
could
do
*NL*
nothing
that
would
satisfy
or
soothe
her
pride
.
No
,
something
else
*NL*
would
happen
--
something
must
happen
--
to
set
her
free
from
this
dread
.
In
*NL*
young
,
childish
,
ignorant
souls
there
is
constantly
this
blind
trust
in
*NL*
some
unshapen
chance
:
it
is
as
hard
to
a
boy
or
girl
to
believe
that
*NL*
a
great
wretchedness
will
actually
befall
them
as
to
believe
that
they
*NL*
will
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
necessity
was
pressing
hard
upon
her
--
now
the
time
of
her
*NL*
marriage
was
close
at
hand
--
she
could
no
longer
rest
in
this
blind
*NL*
trust
.
She
must
run
away
;
she
must
hide
herself
where
no
familiar
eyes
*NL*
could
detect
her
;
and
then
the
terror
of
wandering
out
into
the
world
,
*NL*
of
which
she
knew
nothing
,
made
the
possibility
of
going
to
Arthur
a
*NL*
thought
which
brought
some
comfort
with
it
.
She
felt
so
helpless
now
,
so
*NL*
unable
to
fashion
the
future
for
herself
,
that
the
prospect
of
throwing
*NL*
herself
on
him
had
a
relief
in
it
which
was
stronger
than
her
pride
.
As
*NL*
she
sat
by
the
pool
and
shuddered
at
the
dark
cold
water
,
the
hope
that
*NL*
he
would
receive
her
tenderly
--
that
he
would
care
for
her
and
think
for
*NL*
her
--
was
like
a
sense
of
lulling
warmth
,
that
made
her
for
the
moment
*NL*
indifferent
to
everything
else
;
and
she
began
now
to
think
of
nothing
*NL*
but
the
scheme
by
which
she
should
get
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
a
letter
from
Dinah
lately
,
full
of
kind
words
about
the
*NL*
coming
marriage
,
which
she
had
heard
of
from
Seth
;
and
when
Hetty
had
*NL*
read
this
letter
aloud
to
her
uncle
,
he
had
said
,
``
I
wish
Dinah
`
ud
come
*NL*
again
now
,
for
she
'd
be
a
comfort
to
your
aunt
when
you
're
gone
.
What
*NL*
do
you
think
,
my
wench
,
o
'
going
to
see
her
as
soon
as
you
can
be
spared
*NL*
and
persuading
her
to
come
back
wi
'
you
?
You
might
happen
persuade
her
*NL*
wi
'
telling
her
as
her
aunt
wants
her
,
for
all
she
writes
o
'
not
being
*NL*
able
to
come
.
''
Hetty
had
not
liked
the
thought
of
going
to
Snowfield
,
*NL*
and
felt
no
longing
to
see
Dinah
,
so
she
only
said
,
``
It
's
so
far
off
,
*NL*
Uncle
.
''
But
now
she
thought
this
proposed
visit
would
serve
as
a
pretext
*NL*
for
going
away
.
She
would
tell
her
aunt
when
she
got
home
again
that
she
*NL*
should
like
the
change
of
going
to
Snowfield
for
a
week
or
ten
days
.
And
*NL*
then
,
when
she
got
to
Stoniton
,
where
nobody
knew
her
,
she
would
ask
*NL*
for
the
coach
that
would
take
her
on
the
way
to
Windsor
.
Arthur
was
at
*NL*
Windsor
,
and
she
would
go
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Hetty
had
determined
on
this
scheme
,
she
rose
from
the
*NL*
grassy
bank
of
the
pool
,
took
up
her
basket
,
and
went
on
her
way
to
*NL*
Treddleston
,
for
she
must
buy
the
wedding
things
she
had
come
out
for
,
*NL*
though
she
would
never
want
them
.
She
must
be
careful
not
to
raise
any
*NL*
suspicion
that
she
was
going
to
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
was
quite
agreeably
surprised
that
Hetty
wished
to
go
and
*NL*
see
Dinah
and
try
to
bring
her
back
to
stay
over
the
wedding
.
The
sooner
*NL*
she
went
the
better
,
since
the
weather
was
pleasant
now
;
and
Adam
,
when
*NL*
he
came
in
the
evening
,
said
,
if
Hetty
could
set
off
to-morrow
,
he
*NL*
would
make
time
to
go
with
her
to
Treddleston
and
see
her
safe
into
the
*NL*
Stoniton
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
go
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
,
Hetty
,
''
he
said
,
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
leaning
in
at
the
coach
door
;
``
but
you
wo
n't
stay
much
*NL*
beyond
a
week
--
the
time
`
ull
seem
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
looking
at
her
fondly
,
and
his
strong
hand
held
hers
in
its
*NL*
grasp
.
Hetty
felt
a
sense
of
protection
in
his
presence
--
she
was
used
*NL*
to
it
now
:
if
she
could
have
had
the
past
undone
and
known
no
other
love
*NL*
than
her
quiet
liking
for
Adam
!
The
tears
rose
as
she
gave
him
the
last
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
her
for
loving
me
,
''
said
Adam
,
as
he
went
on
his
way
to
work
*NL*
again
,
with
Gyp
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hetty
's
tears
were
not
for
Adam
--
not
for
the
anguish
that
would
come
*NL*
upon
him
when
he
found
she
was
gone
from
him
for
ever
.
They
were
for
the
*NL*
misery
of
her
own
lot
,
which
took
her
away
from
this
brave
tender
man
*NL*
who
offered
up
his
whole
life
to
her
,
and
threw
her
,
a
poor
helpless
*NL*
suppliant
,
on
the
man
who
would
think
it
a
misfortune
that
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
cling
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
three
o'clock
that
day
,
when
Hetty
was
on
the
coach
that
was
to
take
*NL*
her
,
they
said
,
to
Leicester
--
part
of
the
long
,
long
way
to
Windsor
--
she
*NL*
felt
dimly
that
she
might
be
travelling
all
this
weary
journey
towards
*NL*
the
beginning
of
new
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Arthur
was
at
Windsor
;
he
would
surely
not
be
angry
with
her
.
If
he
*NL*
did
not
mind
about
her
as
he
used
to
do
,
he
had
promised
to
be
good
to
*NL*
her
.

The
Journey
of
Hope
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
LONG
,
lonely
journey
,
with
sadness
in
the
heart
;
away
from
the
*NL*
familiar
to
the
strange
:
that
is
a
hard
and
dreary
thing
even
to
the
*NL*
rich
,
the
strong
,
the
instructed
;
a
hard
thing
,
even
when
we
are
called
*NL*
by
duty
,
not
urged
by
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
it
then
to
Hetty
?
With
her
poor
narrow
thoughts
,
no
longer
*NL*
melting
into
vague
hopes
,
but
pressed
upon
by
the
chill
of
*NL*
definite
fear
,
repeating
again
and
again
the
same
small
round
of
*NL*
memories
--
shaping
again
and
again
the
same
childish
,
doubtful
images
*NL*
of
what
was
to
come
--
seeing
nothing
in
this
wide
world
but
the
little
*NL*
history
of
her
own
pleasures
and
pains
;
with
so
little
money
in
her
*NL*
pocket
,
and
the
way
so
long
and
difficult
.
Unless
she
could
afford
*NL*
always
to
go
in
the
coaches
--
and
she
felt
sure
she
could
not
,
for
the
*NL*
journey
to
Stoniton
was
more
expensive
than
she
had
expected
--
it
was
*NL*
plain
that
she
must
trust
to
carriers
'
carts
or
slow
waggons
;
and
what
*NL*
a
time
it
would
be
before
she
could
get
to
the
end
of
her
journey
!
The
*NL*
burly
old
coachman
from
Oakbourne
,
seeing
such
a
pretty
young
woman
*NL*
among
the
outside
passengers
,
had
invited
her
to
come
and
sit
beside
*NL*
him
;
and
feeling
that
it
became
him
as
a
man
and
a
coachman
to
open
the
*NL*
dialogue
with
a
joke
,
he
applied
himself
as
soon
as
they
were
off
the
*NL*
stones
to
the
elaboration
of
one
suitable
in
all
respects
.
After
many
*NL*
cuts
with
his
whip
and
glances
at
Hetty
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
*NL*
he
lifted
his
lips
above
the
edge
of
his
wrapper
and
said
,
``
He
's
pretty
*NL*
nigh
six
foot
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
isna
he
,
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
Hetty
,
rather
startled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
sweetheart
as
you
've
left
behind
,
or
else
him
as
you
're
goin
'
*NL*
arter
--
which
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
felt
her
face
flushing
and
then
turning
pale
.
She
thought
this
*NL*
coachman
must
know
something
about
her
.
He
must
know
Adam
,
and
might
*NL*
tell
him
where
she
was
gone
,
for
it
is
difficult
to
country
people
to
*NL*
believe
that
those
who
make
a
figure
in
their
own
parish
are
not
known
*NL*
everywhere
else
,
and
it
was
equally
difficult
to
Hetty
to
understand
*NL*
that
chance
words
could
happen
to
apply
closely
to
her
circumstances
.
*NL*
She
was
too
frightened
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hegh
,
hegh
!
''
said
the
coachman
,
seeing
that
his
joke
was
not
so
*NL*
gratifying
as
he
had
expected
,
``
you
munna
take
it
too
ser
`
ous
;
if
he
's
*NL*
behaved
ill
,
get
another
.
Such
a
pretty
lass
as
you
can
get
a
sweetheart
*NL*
any
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
's
fear
was
allayed
by
and
by
,
when
she
found
that
the
coachman
*NL*
made
no
further
allusion
to
her
personal
concerns
;
but
it
still
had
the
*NL*
effect
of
preventing
her
from
asking
him
what
were
the
places
on
the
*NL*
road
to
Windsor
.
She
told
him
she
was
only
going
a
little
way
out
of
*NL*
Stoniton
,
and
when
she
got
down
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stopped
,
she
*NL*
hastened
away
with
her
basket
to
another
part
of
the
town
.
When
she
*NL*
had
formed
her
plan
of
going
to
Windsor
,
she
had
not
foreseen
any
*NL*
difficulties
except
that
of
getting
away
,
and
after
she
had
overcome
*NL*
this
by
proposing
the
visit
to
Dinah
,
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
meeting
*NL*
with
Arthur
and
the
question
how
he
would
behave
to
her
--
not
resting
on
*NL*
any
probable
incidents
of
the
journey
.
She
was
too
entirely
ignorant
*NL*
of
traveling
to
imagine
any
of
its
details
,
and
with
all
her
store
*NL*
of
money
--
her
three
guineas
--
in
her
pocket
,
she
thought
herself
amply
*NL*
provided
.
It
was
not
until
she
found
how
much
it
cost
her
to
get
to
*NL*
Stoniton
that
she
began
to
be
alarmed
about
the
journey
,
and
then
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
she
felt
her
ignorance
as
to
the
places
that
must
be
*NL*
passed
on
her
way
.
Oppressed
with
this
new
alarm
,
she
walked
along
the
*NL*
grim
Stoniton
streets
,
and
at
last
turned
into
a
shabby
little
inn
,
*NL*
where
she
hoped
to
get
a
cheap
lodging
for
the
night
.
Here
she
asked
*NL*
the
landlord
if
he
could
tell
her
what
places
she
must
go
to
,
to
get
to
*NL*
Windsor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
.
Windsor
must
be
pretty
nigh
London
,
for
it
's
*NL*
where
the
king
lives
,
''
was
the
answer
.
``
Anyhow
,
you
'd
best
go
t
'
Ashby
*NL*
next
--
that
's
south
`
ard
.
But
there
's
as
many
places
from
here
to
London
*NL*
as
there
's
houses
in
Stoniton
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
I
've
never
been
*NL*
no
traveller
myself
.
But
how
comes
a
lone
young
woman
like
you
to
be
*NL*
thinking
o
'
taking
such
a
journey
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
my
brother
--
he
's
a
soldier
at
Windsor
,
''
said
Hetty
,
*NL*
frightened
at
the
landlord
's
questioning
look
.
``
I
ca
n't
afford
to
go
*NL*
by
the
coach
;
do
you
think
there
's
a
cart
goes
toward
Ashby
in
the
*NL*
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
may
be
carts
if
anybody
knowed
where
they
started
from
;
but
*NL*
you
might
run
over
the
town
before
you
found
out
.
You
'd
best
set
off
and
*NL*
walk
,
and
trust
to
summat
overtaking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
word
sank
like
lead
on
Hetty
's
spirits
;
she
saw
the
journey
*NL*
stretch
bit
by
bit
before
her
now
.
Even
to
get
to
Ashby
seemed
a
hard
*NL*
thing
:
it
might
take
the
day
,
for
what
she
knew
,
and
that
was
nothing
*NL*
to
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
But
it
must
be
done
--
she
must
get
to
Arthur
.
*NL*
Oh
,
how
she
yearned
to
be
again
with
somebody
who
would
care
for
her
!
*NL*
She
who
had
never
got
up
in
the
morning
without
the
certainty
of
seeing
*NL*
familiar
faces
,
people
on
whom
she
had
an
acknowledged
claim
;
whose
*NL*
farthest
journey
had
been
to
Rosseter
on
the
pillion
with
her
uncle
;
*NL*
whose
thoughts
had
always
been
taking
holiday
in
dreams
of
pleasure
,
*NL*
because
all
the
business
of
her
life
was
managed
for
her
--
this
*NL*
kittenlike
Hetty
,
who
till
a
few
months
ago
had
never
felt
any
other
*NL*
grief
than
that
of
envying
Mary
Burge
a
new
ribbon
,
or
being
girded
*NL*
at
by
her
aunt
for
neglecting
Totty
,
must
now
make
her
toilsome
way
in
*NL*
loneliness
,
her
peaceful
home
left
behind
for
ever
,
and
nothing
but
a
*NL*
tremulous
hope
of
distant
refuge
before
her
.
Now
for
the
first
time
,
as
*NL*
she
lay
down
to-night
in
the
strange
hard
bed
,
she
felt
that
her
home
*NL*
had
been
a
happy
one
,
that
her
uncle
had
been
very
good
to
her
,
that
*NL*
her
quiet
lot
at
Hayslope
among
the
things
and
people
she
knew
,
with
her
*NL*
little
pride
in
her
one
best
gown
and
bonnet
,
and
nothing
to
hide
from
*NL*
any
one
,
was
what
she
would
like
to
wake
up
to
as
a
reality
,
and
find
*NL*
that
all
the
feverish
life
she
had
known
besides
was
a
short
nightmare
.
*NL*
She
thought
of
all
she
had
left
behind
with
yearning
regret
for
her
own
*NL*
sake
.
Her
own
misery
filled
her
heart
--
there
was
no
room
in
it
for
other
*NL*
people
's
sorrow
.
And
yet
,
before
the
cruel
letter
,
Arthur
had
been
so
*NL*
tender
and
loving
.
The
memory
of
that
had
still
a
charm
for
her
,
though
*NL*
it
was
no
more
than
a
soothing
draught
that
just
made
pain
bearable
.
*NL*
For
Hetty
could
conceive
no
other
existence
for
herself
in
future
than
*NL*
a
hidden
one
,
and
a
hidden
life
,
even
with
love
,
would
have
had
no
*NL*
delights
for
her
;
still
less
a
life
mingled
with
shame
.
She
knew
no
*NL*
romances
,
and
had
only
a
feeble
share
in
the
feelings
which
are
the
*NL*
source
of
romance
,
so
that
well-read
ladies
may
find
it
difficult
to
*NL*
understand
her
state
of
mind
.
She
was
too
ignorant
of
everything
beyond
*NL*
the
simple
notions
and
habits
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
to
have
*NL*
any
more
definite
idea
of
her
probable
future
than
that
Arthur
would
*NL*
take
care
of
her
somehow
,
and
shelter
her
from
anger
and
scorn
.
He
would
*NL*
not
marry
her
and
make
her
a
lady
;
and
apart
from
that
she
could
think
*NL*
of
nothing
he
could
give
towards
which
she
looked
with
longing
and
*NL*
ambition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
she
rose
early
,
and
taking
only
some
milk
and
bread
*NL*
for
her
breakfast
,
set
out
to
walk
on
the
road
towards
Ashby
,
under
a
*NL*
leaden-coloured
sky
,
with
a
narrowing
streak
of
yellow
,
like
a
departing
*NL*
hope
,
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
.
Now
in
her
faintness
of
heart
at
the
*NL*
length
and
difficulty
of
her
journey
,
she
was
most
of
all
afraid
of
*NL*
spending
her
money
,
and
becoming
so
destitute
that
she
would
have
to
ask
*NL*
people
's
charity
;
for
Hettv
had
the
pride
not
only
of
a
proud
nature
*NL*
but
of
a
proud
class
--
the
class
that
pays
the
most
poor-rates
,
and
*NL*
most
shudders
at
the
idea
of
profiting
by
a
poor-rate
.
It
had
not
yet
*NL*
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
get
money
for
her
locket
and
earrings
*NL*
which
she
carried
with
her
,
and
she
applied
all
her
small
arithmetic
*NL*
and
knowledge
of
prices
to
calculating
how
many
meals
and
how
many
rides
*NL*
were
contained
in
her
two
guineas
,
and
the
odd
shillings
,
which
had
*NL*
a
melancholy
look
,
as
if
they
were
the
pale
ashes
of
the
other
*NL*
bright-flaming
coin
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
few
miles
out
of
Stoniton
,
she
walked
on
bravely
,
always
*NL*
fixing
on
some
tree
or
gate
or
projecting
bush
at
the
most
distant
*NL*
visible
point
in
the
road
as
a
goal
,
and
feeling
a
faint
joy
when
she
*NL*
had
reached
it
.
But
when
she
came
to
the
fourth
milestone
,
the
first
she
*NL*
had
happened
to
notice
among
the
long
grass
by
the
roadside
,
and
read
*NL*
that
she
was
still
only
four
miles
beyond
Stoniton
,
her
courage
sank
.
*NL*
She
had
come
only
this
little
way
,
and
yet
felt
tired
,
and
almost
hungry
*NL*
again
in
the
keen
morning
air
;
for
though
Hetty
was
accustomed
to
much
*NL*
movement
and
exertion
indoors
,
she
was
not
used
to
long
walks
which
*NL*
produced
quite
a
different
sort
of
fatigue
from
that
of
household
*NL*
activity
.
As
she
was
looking
at
the
milestone
she
felt
some
drops
*NL*
falling
on
her
face
--
it
was
beginning
to
rain
.
Here
was
a
new
trouble
*NL*
which
had
not
entered
into
her
sad
thoughts
before
,
and
quite
weighed
*NL*
down
by
this
sudden
addition
to
her
burden
,
she
sat
down
on
the
step
of
*NL*
a
stile
and
began
to
sob
hysterically
.
The
beginning
of
hardship
is
like
*NL*
the
first
taste
of
bitter
food
--
it
seems
for
a
moment
unbearable
;
yet
,
*NL*
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
satisfy
our
hunger
,
we
take
another
bite
*NL*
and
find
it
possible
to
go
on
.
When
Hetty
recovered
from
her
burst
of
*NL*
weeping
,
she
rallied
her
fainting
courage
:
it
was
raining
,
and
she
*NL*
must
try
to
get
on
to
a
village
where
she
might
find
rest
and
shelter
.
*NL*
Presently
,
as
she
walked
on
wearily
,
she
heard
the
rumbling
of
heavy
*NL*
wheels
behind
her
;
a
covered
waggon
was
coming
,
creeping
slowly
along
*NL*
with
a
slouching
driver
cracking
his
whip
beside
the
horses
.
She
waited
*NL*
for
it
,
thinking
that
if
the
waggoner
were
not
a
very
sour-looking
man
,
*NL*
she
would
ask
him
to
take
her
up
.
As
the
waggon
approached
her
,
the
*NL*
driver
had
fallen
behind
,
but
there
was
something
in
the
front
of
the
*NL*
big
vehicle
which
encouraged
her
.
At
any
previous
moment
in
her
life
*NL*
she
would
not
have
noticed
it
,
but
now
,
the
new
susceptibility
that
*NL*
suffering
had
awakened
in
her
caused
this
object
to
impress
her
*NL*
strongly
.
It
was
only
a
small
white-and-liver-coloured
spaniel
which
*NL*
sat
on
the
front
ledge
of
the
waggon
,
with
large
timid
eyes
,
and
an
*NL*
incessant
trembling
in
the
body
,
such
as
you
may
have
seen
in
some
of
*NL*
these
small
creatures
.
Hetty
cared
little
for
animals
,
as
you
know
,
*NL*
but
at
this
moment
she
felt
as
if
the
helpless
timid
creature
had
some
*NL*
fellowship
with
her
,
and
without
being
quite
aware
of
the
reason
,
she
*NL*
was
less
doubtful
about
speaking
to
the
driver
,
who
now
came
forward
--
a
*NL*
large
ruddy
man
,
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulders
,
by
way
of
scarf
or
*NL*
mantle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
take
me
up
in
your
waggon
,
if
you
're
going
towards
Ashby
?
''
*NL*
said
Hetty
.
``
I
'll
pay
you
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
''
said
the
big
fellow
,
with
that
slowly
dawning
smile
which
belongs
*NL*
to
heavy
faces
,
``
I
can
take
y
'
up
fawst
enough

Where

*NL*

And

Ashby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
Stoniton
.
I
'm
going
a
long
way
--
to
Windsor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Arter
some
service
,
or
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
my
brother
--

's

there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
going

--
and
fur
enough

--
but

''
*NL*
*NL*
To
lie
on
the
wool-packs
,
with
a
cranny
left
between
the
curtains
of
the
*NL*
awning
to
let
in
the
air
,
was
luxury
to
Hetty
now
,
and
she
half-slept
*NL*
away
the
hours
till
the
driver
came
to
ask
her
if
she
wanted
to
get
down
*NL*
and
have
``
some
victual
''
;
he
himself
was
going
to
eat
his
dinner
at
this
*NL*
``
public
.
''
Late
at
night
they
reached
Leicester
,
and
so
this
second
day
*NL*
of
Hetty
's
journey
was
past
.
She
had
spent
no
money
except
what
she
*NL*
had
paid
for
her
food
,
but
she
felt
that
this
slow
journeying
would
be
*NL*
intolerable
for
her
another
day
,
and
in
the
morning
she
found
her
way
*NL*
to
a
coach-office
to
ask
about
the
road
to
Windsor
,
and
see
if
it
would
*NL*
cost
her
too
much
to
go
part
of
the
distance
by
coach
again
.
Yes
!
The
*NL*
distance
was
too
great
--
the
coaches
were
too
dear
--
she
must
give
them
*NL*
up
;
but
the
elderly
clerk
at
the
office
,
touched
by
her
pretty
anxious
*NL*
face
,
wrote
down
for
her
the
names
of
the
chief
places
she
must
pass
*NL*
through
.
This
was
the
only
comfort
she
got
in
Leicester
,
for
the
men
*NL*
stared
at
her
as
she
went
along
the
street
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
*NL*
her
life
Hetty
wished
no
one
would
look
at
her
.
She
set
out
walking
*NL*
again
;
but
this
day
she
was
fortunate
,
for
she
was
soon
overtaken
by
*NL*
a
carrier
's
cart
which
carried
her
to
Hinckley
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
*NL*
return
chaise
,
with
a
drunken
postilion
--
who
frightened
her
by
driving
*NL*
like
Jehu
the
son
of
Nimshi
,
and
shouting
hilarious
remarks
at
her
,
*NL*
twisting
himself
backwards
on
his
saddle
--
she
was
before
night
in
the
*NL*
heart
of
woody
Warwickshire
:
but
still
almost
a
hundred
miles
from
*NL*
Windsor
,
they
told
her
.
Oh
what
a
large
world
it
was
,
and
what
hard
work
*NL*
for
her
to
find
her
way
in
it
!
She
went
by
mistake
to
Stratford-on-Avon
,
*NL*
finding
Stratford
set
down
in
her
list
of
places
,
and
then
she
was
told
*NL*
she
had
come
a
long
way
out
of
the
right
road
.
It
was
not
till
the
fifth
*NL*
day
that
she
got
to
Stony
Stratford
.
That
seems
but
a
slight
journey
as
*NL*
you
look
at
the
map
,
or
remember
your
own
pleasant
travels
to
and
from
*NL*
the
meadowy
banks
of
the
Avon
.
But
how
wearily
long
it
was
to
Hetty
!
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
as
if
this
country
of
flat
fields
,
and
hedgerows
,
and
*NL*
dotted
houses
,
and
villages
,
and
market-towns
--
all
so
much
alike
to
her
*NL*
indifferent
eyes
--
must
have
no
end
,
and
she
must
go
on
wandering
among
*NL*
them
for
ever
,
waiting
tired
at
toll-gates
for
some
cart
to
come
,
and
*NL*
then
finding
the
cart
went
only
a
little
way
--
a
very
little
way
--
to
the
*NL*
miller
's
a
mile
off
perhaps
;
and
she
hated
going
into
the
public
houses
,
*NL*
where
she
must
go
to
get
food
and
ask
questions
,
because
there
were
*NL*
always
men
lounging
there
,
who
stared
at
her
and
joked
her
rudely
.
Her
*NL*
body
was
very
weary
too
with
these
days
of
new
fatigue
and
anxiety
;
they
*NL*
had
made
her
look
more
pale
and
worn
than
all
the
time
of
hidden
dread
*NL*
she
had
gone
through
at
home
.
When
at
last
she
reached
Stony
Stratford
,
*NL*
her
impatience
and
weariness
had
become
too
strong
for
her
economical
*NL*
caution
;
she
determined
to
take
the
coach
for
the
rest
of
the
way
,
*NL*
though
it
should
cost
her
all
her
remaining
money
.
She
would
need
*NL*
nothing
at
Windsor
but
to
find
Arthur
.
When
she
had
paid
the
fare
for
*NL*
the
last
coach
,
she
had
only
a
shilling
;
and
as
she
got
down
at
the
*NL*
sign
of
the
Green
Man
in
Windsor
at
twelve
o'clock
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
seventh
day
,
hungry
and
faint
,
the
coachman
came
up
,
and
begged
her
*NL*
to
``
remember
him
.
''
She
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
took
out
the
*NL*
shilling
,
but
the
tears
came
with
the
sense
of
exhaustion
and
the
*NL*
thought
that
she
was
giving
away
her
last
means
of
getting
food
,
which
*NL*
she
really
required
before
she
could
go
in
search
of
Arthur
.
As
she
*NL*
held
out
the
shilling
,
she
lifted
up
her
dark
tear-filled
eyes
to
the
*NL*
coachman
's
face
and
said
,
``
Can
you
give
me
back
sixpence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
he
said
,
gruffly
,
``
never
mind
--
put
the
shilling
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
of
the
Green
Man
had
stood
near
enough
to
witness
this
*NL*
scene
,
and
he
was
a
man
whose
abundant
feeding
served
to
keep
his
*NL*
good
nature
,
as
well
as
his
person
,
in
high
condition
.
And
that
lovely
*NL*
tearful
face
of
Hetty
's
would
have
found
out
the
sensitive
fibre
in
most
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
young
woman
,
come
in
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
have
adrop
o
'
something
;
*NL*
you
're
pretty
well
knocked
up
,
I
can
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
into
the
bar
and
said
to
his
wife
,
``
Here
,
missis
,
take
this
*NL*
young
woman
into
the
parlour
;
she
's
a
little
overcome
''
--
for
Hetty
's
*NL*
tears
were
falling
fast
.
They
were
merely
hysterical
tears
:
she
thought
*NL*
she
had
no
reason
for
weeping
now
,
and
was
vexed
that
she
was
too
weak
*NL*
and
tired
to
help
it
.
She
was
at
Windsor
at
last
,
not
far
from
Arthur
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
with
eager
,
hungry
eyes
at
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
that
*NL*
the
landlady
brought
her
,
and
for
some
minutes
she
forgot
everything
*NL*
else
in
the
delicious
sensations
of
satisfying
hunger
and
recovering
*NL*
from
exhaustion
.
The
landlady
sat
opposite
to
her
as
she
ate
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
her
earnestly
.
No
wonder
:
Hetty
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
,
and
her
*NL*
curls
had
fallen
down
.
Her
face
was
all
the
more
touching
in
its
*NL*
youth
and
beauty
because
of
its
weary
look
,
and
the
good
woman
's
eyes
*NL*
presently
wandered
to
her
figure
,
which
in
her
hurried
dressing
on
her
*NL*
journey
she
had
taken
no
pains
to
conceal
;
moreover
,
the
stranger
's
eye
*NL*
detects
what
the
familiar
unsuspecting
eye
leaves
unnoticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
not
very
fit
for
travelling
,
''
she
said
,
glancing
while
she
*NL*
spoke
at
Hetty
's
ringless
hand
.
``
Have
you
come
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
,
roused
by
this
question
to
exert
more
self-command
,
*NL*
and
feeling
the
better
for
the
food
she
had
taken
.
``
I
've
come
a
good
*NL*
long
way
,
and
it
's
very
tiring
.
But
I
'm
better
now
.
Could
you
tell
me
*NL*
which
way
to
go
to
this
place
?
''
Here
Hetty
took
from
her
pocket
a
bit
*NL*
of
paper
:
it
was
the
end
of
Arthur
's
letter
on
which
he
had
written
his
*NL*
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
speaking
,
the
landlord
had
come
in
and
had
begun
to
look
*NL*
at
her
as
earnestly
as
his
wife
had
done
.
He
took
up
the
piece
of
paper
*NL*
which
Hetty
handed
across
the
table
,
and
read
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
want
at
this
house
?
''
he
said
.
It
is
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
innkeepers
and
all
men
who
have
no
pressing
business
of
their
own
to
ask
*NL*
as
many
questions
as
possible
before
giving
any
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
a
gentleman
as
is
there
,
''
said
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
no
gentleman
there
,
''
returned
the
landlord
.
``
It
's
shut
*NL*
up
--
been
shut
up
this
fortnight
.
What
gentleman
is
it
you
want
?
Perhaps
*NL*
I
can
let
you
know
where
to
find
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Captain
Donnithorne
,
''
said
Hetty
tremulously
,
her
heart
beginning
*NL*
to
beat
painfully
at
this
disappointment
of
her
hope
that
she
should
*NL*
find
Arthur
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Donnithorne
?
Stop
a
bit
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
slowly
.
``
Was
he
*NL*
in
the
Loamshire
Militia
?
A
tall
young
officer
with
a
fairish
skin
and
*NL*
reddish
whiskers
--
and
had
a
servant
by
the
name
o
'
Pym
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Hetty
;
``
you
know
him
--
where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
sight
o
'
miles
away
from
here
.
The
Loamshire
Militia
's
gone
to
*NL*
Ireland
;
it
's
been
gone
this
fortnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
there
!
She
's
fainting
,
''
said
the
landlady
,
hastening
to
support
*NL*
Hetty
,
who
had
lost
her
miserable
consciousness
and
looked
like
a
*NL*
beautiful
corpse
.
They
carried
her
to
the
sofa
and
loosened
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
bad
business
,
I
suspect
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
as
he
brought
in
*NL*
some
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
plain
enough
what
sort
of
business
it
is
,
''
said
the
wife
.
*NL*
``
She
's
not
a
common
flaunting
dratchell
,
I
can
see
that
.
She
looks
like
*NL*
a
respectable
country
girl
,
and
she
comes
from
a
good
way
off
,
to
judge
*NL*
by
her
tongue
.
She
talks
something
like
that
ostler
we
had
that
come
*NL*
from
the
north
.
He
was
as
honest
a
fellow
as
we
ever
had
about
the
*NL*
house
--
they
're
all
honest
folks
in
the
north
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
a
prettier
young
woman
in
my
life
,
''
said
the
husband
.
*NL*
``
She
's
like
a
pictur
in
a
shop-winder
.
It
goes
to
one

eart
to
look
at
*NL*
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

have
been
a
good
deal
better
for
her
if
she
'd
been
uglier
and
*NL*
had
more
conduct

''
said
the
landlady
,
who
on
any
charitable
construction
*NL*
must
have
been
supposed
to
have
more
``
conduct
''
than
beauty
.
``
But
she
's
*NL*
coming
to
again
.
Fetch
a
drop
more
water

Chapter
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Journey
in
Despair
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HETTY
was
too
ill
through
the
rest
of
that
day
for
any
questions
to
be
*NL*
addressed
to
her
--
too
ill
even
to
think
with
any
distinctness
of
the
*NL*
evils
that
were
to
come
.
She
only
felt
that
all
her
hope
was
crushed
,
*NL*
and
that
instead
of
having
found
a
refuge
she
had
only
reached
the
*NL*
borders
of
a
new
wilderness
where
no
goal
lay
before
her
.
The
sensations
*NL*
of
bodily
sickness
,
in
a
comfortable
bed
,
and
with
the
tendance
of
the
*NL*
good-natured
landlady
,
made
a
sort
of
respite
for
her
;
such
a
respite
as
*NL*
there
is
in
the
faint
weariness
which
obliges
a
man
to
throw
himself
on
*NL*
the
sand
instead
of
toiling
onward
under
the
scorching
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
sleep
and
rest
had
brought
back
the
strength
necessary
for
the
*NL*
keenness
of
mental
suffering
--
when
she
lay
the
next
morning
looking
at
*NL*
the
growing
light
which
was
like
a
cruel
task-master
returning
to
urge
*NL*
from
her
a
fresh
round
of
hated
hopeless
labour
--
she
began
to
think
what
*NL*
course
she
must
take
,
to
remember
that
all
her
money
was
gone
,
to
*NL*
look
at
the
prospect
of
further
wandering
among
strangers
with
the
new
*NL*
clearness
shed
on
it
by
the
experience
of
her
journey
to
Windsor
.
But
*NL*
which
way
could
she
turn
?
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
enter
into
any
*NL*
service
,
even
if
she
could
obtain
it
.
There
was
nothing
but
immediate
*NL*
beggary
before
her
.
She
thought
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
found
*NL*
against
the
church
wall
at
Hayslope
one
Sunday
,
nearly
dead
with
cold
*NL*
and
hunger
--
a
tiny
infant
in
her
arms
.
The
woman
was
rescued
and
taken
*NL*
to
the
parish
.
``
The
parish
!
''
You
can
perhaps
hardly
understand
the
*NL*
effect
of
that
word
on
a
mind
like
Hetty
's
,
brought
up
among
people
who
*NL*
were
somewhat
hard
in
their
feelings
even
towards
poverty
,
who
lived
*NL*
among
the
fields
,
and
had
little
pity
for
want
and
rags
as
a
cruel
*NL*
inevitable
fate
such
as
they
sometimes
seem
in
cities
,
but
held
them
*NL*
a
mark
of
idleness
and
vice
--
and
it
was
idleness
and
vice
that
brought
*NL*
burdens
on
the
parish
.
To
Hetty
the
``
parish
''
was
next
to
the
prison
*NL*
in
obloquy
,
and
to
ask
anything
of
strangers
--
to
beg
--
lay
in
the
same
*NL*
far-off
hideous
region
of
intolerable
shame
that
Hetty
had
all
her
life
*NL*
thought
it
impossible
she
could
ever
come
near
.
But
now
the
remembrance
*NL*
of
that
wretched
woman
whom
she
had
seen
herself
,
on
her
way
from
*NL*
church
,
being
carried
into
Joshua
Rann
's
,
came
back
upon
her
with
the
*NL*
new
terrible
sense
that
there
was
very
little
now
to
divide
HER
from
*NL*
the
same
lot
.
And
the
dread
of
bodily
hardship
mingled
with
the
dread
*NL*
of
shame
;
for
Hetty
had
the
luxurious
nature
of
a
round
soft-coated
pet
*NL*
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
she
yearned
to
be
back
in
her
safe
home
again
,
cherished
and
cared
*NL*
for
as
she
had
always
been
!
Her
aunt
's
scolding
about
trifles
would
have
*NL*
been
music
to
her
ears
now
;
she
longed
for
it
;
she
used
to
hear
it
in
a
*NL*
time
when
she
had
only
trifles
to
hide
.
Could
she
be
the
same
Hetty
that
*NL*
used
to
make
up
the
butter
in
the
dairy
with
the
Guelder
roses
peeping
*NL*
in
at
the
window
--
she
,
a
runaway
whom
her
friends
would
not
open
their
*NL*
doors
to
again
,
lying
in
this
strange
bed
,
with
the
knowledge
that
*NL*
she
had
no
money
to
pay
for
what
she
received
,
and
must
offer
those
*NL*
strangers
some
of
the
clothes
in
her
basket
?
It
was
then
she
thought
of
*NL*
her
locket
and
ear-rings
,
and
seeing
her
pocket
lie
near
,
she
reached
it
*NL*
and
spread
the
contents
on
the
bed
before
her
.
There
were
the
locket
and
*NL*
ear-rings
in
the
little
velvet-lined
boxes
,
and
with
them
there
was
a
*NL*
beautiful
silver
thimble
which
Adam
had
bought
her
,
the
words
``
Remember
*NL*
me
''
making
the
ornament
of
the
border
;
a
steel
purse
,
with
her
one
*NL*
shilling
in
it
;
and
a
small
red-leather
case
,
fastening
with
a
strap
.
*NL*
Those
beautiful
little
ear-rings
,
with
their
delicate
pearls
and
garnet
,
*NL*
that
she
had
tried
in
her
ears
with
such
longing
in
the
bright
sunshine
*NL*
on
the
30th
of
July
!
She
had
no
longing
to
put
them
in
her
ears
now
:
her
*NL*
head
with
its
dark
rings
of
hair
lay
back
languidly
on
the
pillow
,
and
*NL*
the
sadness
that
rested
about
her
brow
and
eyes
was
something
too
hard
*NL*
for
regretful
memory
.
Yet
she
put
her
hands
up
to
her
ears
:
it
was
*NL*
because
there
were
some
thin
gold
rings
in
them
,
which
were
also
worth
*NL*
a
little
money
.
Yes
,
she
could
surely
get
some
money
for
her
ornaments
:
*NL*
those
Arthur
had
given
her
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
.
The
*NL*
landlord
and
landlady
had
been
good
to
her
;
perhaps
they
would
help
her
*NL*
to
get
the
money
for
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
money
would
not
keep
her
long
.
What
should
she
do
when
it
was
*NL*
gone
?
Where
should
she
go
?
The
horrible
thought
of
want
and
beggary
*NL*
drove
her
once
to
think
she
would
go
back
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
ask
*NL*
them
to
forgive
her
and
have
pity
on
her
.
But
she
shrank
from
that
idea
*NL*
again
,
as
she
might
have
shrunk
from
scorching
metal
.
She
could
never
*NL*
endure
that
shame
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
before
Mary
Burge
,
and
the
*NL*
servants
at
the
Chase
,
and
the
people
at
Broxton
,
and
everybody
who
knew
*NL*
her
.
They
should
never
know
what
had
happened
to
her
.
What
could
she
do
?
*NL*
She
would
go
away
from
Windsor
--
travel
again
as
she
had
done
the
last
*NL*
week
,
and
get
among
the
flat
green
fields
with
the
high
hedges
round
*NL*
them
,
where
nobody
could
see
her
or
know
her
;
and
there
,
perhaps
,
when
*NL*
there
was
nothing
else
she
could
do
,
she
should
get
courage
to
drown
*NL*
herself
in
some
pond
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
.
Yes
,
she
would
get
*NL*
away
from
Windsor
as
soon
as
possible
:
she
did
n't
like
these
people
at
*NL*
the
inn
to
know
about
her
,
to
know
that
she
had
come
to
look
for
Captain
*NL*
Donnithorne
.
She
must
think
of
some
reason
to
tell
them
why
she
had
*NL*
asked
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
thought
she
began
to
put
the
things
back
into
her
pocket
,
*NL*
meaning
to
get
up
and
dress
before
the
landlady
came
to
her
.
She
had
her
*NL*
hand
on
the
red-leather
case
,
when
it
occurred
to
her
that
there
might
*NL*
be
something
in
this
case
which
she
had
forgotten
--
something
worth
*NL*
selling
;
for
without
knowing
what
she
should
do
with
her
life
,
she
*NL*
craved
the
means
of
living
as
long
as
possible
;
and
when
we
desire
*NL*
eagerly
to
find
something
,
we
are
apt
to
search
for
it
in
hopeless
*NL*
places
.
No
,
there
was
nothing
but
common
needles
and
pins
,
and
dried
*NL*
tulip-petals
between
the
paper
leaves
where
she
had
written
down
her
*NL*
little
money-accounts
.
But
on
one
of
these
leaves
there
was
a
name
,
*NL*
which
,
often
as
she
had
seen
it
before
,
now
flashed
on
Hetty
's
mind
like
*NL*
a
newly
discovered
message
.
The
name
was
--
Dinah
Morris
,
Snowfield
.
There
*NL*
was
a
text
above
it
,
written
,
as
well
as
the
name
,
by
Dinah
's
own
hand
*NL*
with
a
little
pencil
,
one
evening
that
they
were
sitting
together
and
*NL*
Hetty
happened
to
have
the
red
case
lying
open
before
her
.
Hetty
did
not
*NL*
read
the
text
now
:
she
was
only
arrested
by
the
name
.
Now
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
she
remembered
without
indifference
the
affectionate
kindness
*NL*
Dinah
had
shown
her
,
and
those
words
of
Dinah
in
the
bed-chamber
--
that
*NL*
Hetty
must
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
.
Suppose
she
were
to
go
*NL*
to
Dinah
,
and
ask
her
to
help
her
?
Dinah
did
not
think
about
things
as
*NL*
other
people
did
.
She
was
a
mystery
to
Hetty
,
but
Hetty
knew
she
was
*NL*
always
kind
.
She
could
n't
imagine
Dinah
's
face
turning
away
from
her
in
*NL*
dark
reproof
or
scorn
,
Dinah
's
voice
willingly
speaking
ill
of
her
,
or
*NL*
rejoicing
in
her
misery
as
a
punishment
.
Dinah
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
*NL*
that
world
of
Hetty
's
,
whose
glance
she
dreaded
like
scorching
fire
.
But
*NL*
even
to
her
Hetty
shrank
from
beseeching
and
confession
.
She
could
not
*NL*
prevail
on
herself
to
say
,
``
I
will
go
to
Dinah
''
:
she
only
thought
of
*NL*
that
as
a
possible
alternative
,
if
she
had
not
courage
for
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
landlady
was
amazed
when
she
saw
Hetty
come
downstairs
soon
*NL*
after
herself
,
neatly
dressed
,
and
looking
resolutely
self-possessed
.
*NL*
Hetty
told
her
she
was
quite
well
this
morning
.
She
had
only
been
very
*NL*
tired
and
overcome
with
her
journey
,
for
she
had
come
a
long
way
to
ask
*NL*
about
her
brother
,
who
had
run
away
,
and
they
thought
he
was
gone
for
a
*NL*
soldier
,
and
Captain
Donnithorne
might
know
,
for
he
had
been
very
*NL*
kind
to
her
brother
once
.
It
was
a
lame
story
,
and
the
landlady
looked
*NL*
doubtfully
at
Hetty
as
she
told
it
;
but
there
was
a
resolute
air
of
*NL*
self-reliance
about
her
this
morning
,
so
different
from
the
helpless
*NL*
prostration
of
yesterday
,
that
the
landlady
hardly
knew
how
to
make
a
*NL*
remark
that
might
seem
like
prying
into
other
people
's
affairs
.
She
only
*NL*
invited
her
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
with
them
,
and
in
the
course
of
it
*NL*
Hetty
brought
out
her
ear-rings
and
locket
,
and
asked
the
landlord
if
*NL*
he
could
help
her
to
get
money
for
them
.
Her
journey
,
she
said
,
had
cost
*NL*
her
much
more
than
she
expected
,
and
now
she
had
no
money
to
get
back
to
*NL*
her
friends
,
which
she
wanted
to
do
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
first
time
the
landlady
had
seen
the
ornaments
,
for
she
*NL*
had
examined
the
contents
of
Hetty
's
pocket
yesterday
,
and
she
and
her
*NL*
husband
had
discussed
the
fact
of
a
country
girl
having
these
beautiful
*NL*
things
,
with
a
stronger
conviction
than
ever
that
Hetty
had
been
*NL*
miserably
deluded
by
the
fine
young
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
when
Hetty
had
spread
the
precious
trifles
*NL*
before
him
,
``
we
might
take
'em
to
the
jeweller
's
shop
,
for
there
's
one
*NL*
not
far
off
;
but
Lord
bless
you
,
they
would
n't
give
you
a
quarter
o
'
*NL*
what
the
things
are
worth
.
And
you
would
n't
like
to
part
with
'em
?
''
he
*NL*
added
,
looking
at
her
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
,
''
said
Hetty
,
hastily
,
``
so
as
I
can
get
money
to
go
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
might
think
the
things
were
stolen
,
as
you
wanted
to
sell
*NL*
'em
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
for
it
is
n't
usual
for
a
young
woman
like
you
to
have
*NL*
fine
jew
`
llery
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Hetty
's
face
with
anger
.
``
I
belong
to
respectable
*NL*
folks
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
'm
not
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
you
are
n't
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
''
said
the
landlady
;
``
and
you
'd
no
*NL*
call
to
say
that
,
''
looking
indignantly
at
her
husband
.
``
The
things
were
*NL*
gev
to
her
:
that
's
plain
enough
to
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
as
I
thought
so
,
''
said
the
husband
,
apologetically
,
*NL*
``
but
I
said
it
was
what
the
jeweller
might
think
,
and
so
he
would
n't
be
*NL*
offering
much
money
for
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
wife
,
``
suppose
you
were
to
advance
some
money
on
the
*NL*
things
yourself
,
and
then
if
she
liked
to
redeem
'em
when
she
got
home
,
*NL*
she
could
.
But
if
we
heard
nothing
from
her
after
two
months
,
we
might
*NL*
do
as
we
liked
with
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
say
that
in
this
accommodating
proposition
the
landlady
had
*NL*
no
regard
whatever
to
the
possible
reward
of
her
good
nature
in
the
*NL*
ultimate
possession
of
the
locket
and
ear-rings
:
indeed
,
the
effect
they
*NL*
would
have
in
that
case
on
the
mind
of
the
grocer
's
wife
had
presented
*NL*
itself
with
remarkable
vividness
to
her
rapid
imagination
.
The
landlord
*NL*
took
up
the
ornaments
and
pushed
out
his
lips
in
a
meditative
manner
.
*NL*
He
wished
Hetty
well
,
doubtless
;
but
pray
,
how
many
of
your
well-wishers
*NL*
would
decline
to
make
a
little
gain
out
of
you
?
Your
landlady
is
*NL*
sincerely
affected
at
parting
with
you
,
respects
you
highly
,
and
will
*NL*
really
rejoice
if
any
one
else
is
generous
to
you
;
but
at
the
same
*NL*
time
she
hands
you
a
bill
by
which
she
gains
as
high
a
percentage
as
*NL*
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
money
do
you
want
to
get
home
with
,
young
woman
?
''
said
the
*NL*
well-wisher
,
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
guineas
,
''
answered
Hetty
,
fixing
on
the
sum
she
set
out
with
,
for
*NL*
want
of
any
other
standard
,
and
afraid
of
asking
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
no
objections
to
advance
you
three
guineas
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landlord
;
``
and
if
you
like
to
send
it
me
back
and
get
the
jewellery
*NL*
again
,
you
can
,
you
know
.
The
Green
Man
is
n't
going
to
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
'll
be
very
glad
if
you
'll
give
me
that
,
''
said
Hetty
,
relieved
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
she
would
not
have
to
go
to
the
jeweller
's
and
be
*NL*
stared
at
and
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
want
the
things
again
,
you
'll
write
before
long
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landlady
,
``
because
when
two
months
are
up
,
we
shall
make
up
our
minds
as
*NL*
you
do
n't
want
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
and
wife
were
equally
content
with
this
arrangement
.
The
*NL*
husband
thought
,
if
the
ornaments
were
not
redeemed
,
he
could
make
a
*NL*
good
thing
of
it
by
taking
them
to
London
and
selling
them
.
The
wife
*NL*
thought
she
would
coax
the
good
man
into
letting
her
keep
them
.
And
*NL*
they
were
accommodating
Hetty
,
poor
thing
--
a
pretty
,
respectable-looking
*NL*
young
woman
,
apparently
in
a
sad
case
.
They
declined
to
take
anything
*NL*
for
her
food
and
bed
:
she
was
quite
welcome
.
And
at
eleven
o'clock
Hetty
*NL*
said
``
Good-bye
''
to
them
with
the
same
quiet
,
resolute
air
she
had
worn
*NL*
all
the
morning
,
mounting
the
coach
that
was
to
take
her
twenty
miles
*NL*
back
along
the
way
she
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
strength
of
self-possession
which
is
the
sign
that
the
*NL*
last
hope
has
departed
.
Despair
no
more
leans
on
others
than
perfect
*NL*
contentment
,
and
in
despair
pride
ceases
to
be
counteracted
by
the
sense
*NL*
of
dependence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
felt
that
no
one
could
deliver
her
from
the
evils
that
would
make
*NL*
life
hateful
to
her
;
and
no
one
,
she
said
to
herself
,
should
ever
know
*NL*
her
misery
and
humiliation
.
No
;
she
would
not
confess
even
to
Dinah
.
She
*NL*
would
wander
out
of
sight
,
and
drown
herself
where
her
body
would
never
*NL*
be
found
,
and
no
one
should
know
what
had
become
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
off
this
coach
,
she
began
to
walk
again
,
and
take
cheap
*NL*
rides
in
carts
,
and
get
cheap
meals
,
going
on
and
on
without
distinct
*NL*
purpose
,
yet
strangely
,
by
some
fascination
,
taking
the
way
she
had
*NL*
come
,
though
she
was
determined
not
to
go
back
to
her
own
country
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
fixed
her
mind
on
the
grassy
Warwickshire
*NL*
fields
,
with
the
bushy
tree-studded
hedgerows
that
made
a
hiding-place
*NL*
even
in
this
leafless
season
.
She
went
more
slowly
than
she
came
,
often
*NL*
getting
over
the
stiles
and
sitting
for
hours
under
the
hedgerows
,
*NL*
looking
before
her
with
blank
,
beautiful
eyes
;
fancying
herself
at
the
*NL*
edge
of
a
hidden
pool
,
low
down
,
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
;
wondering
*NL*
if
it
were
very
painful
to
be
drowned
,
and
if
there
would
be
anything
*NL*
worse
after
death
than
what
she
dreaded
in
life
.
Religious
doctrines
had
*NL*
taken
no
hold
on
Hetty
's
mind
.
She
was
one
of
those
numerous
people
*NL*
who
have
had
godfathers
and
godmothers
,
learned
their
catechism
,
been
*NL*
confirmed
,
and
gone
to
church
every
Sunday
,
and
yet
,
for
any
practical
*NL*
result
of
strength
in
life
,
or
trust
in
death
,
have
never
appropriated
a
*NL*
single
Christian
idea
or
Christian
feeling
.
You
would
misunderstand
*NL*
her
thoughts
during
these
wretched
days
,
if
you
imagined
that
they
were
*NL*
influenced
either
by
religious
fears
or
religious
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
chose
to
go
to
Stratford-on-Avon
again
,
where
she
had
gone
before
by
*NL*
mistake
,
for
she
remembered
some
grassy
fields
on
her
former
way
towards
*NL*
it
--
fields
among
which
she
thought
she
might
find
just
the
sort
of
pool
*NL*
she
had
in
her
mind
.
Yet
she
took
care
of
her
money
still
;
she
carried
*NL*
her
basket
;
death
seemed
still
a
long
way
off
,
and
life
was
so
strong
*NL*
in
her
.
She
craved
food
and
rest
--
she
hastened
towards
them
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
she
was
picturing
to
herself
the
bank
from
which
she
would
leap
*NL*
towards
death
.
It
was
already
five
days
since
she
had
left
Windsor
,
for
*NL*
she
had
wandered
about
,
always
avoiding
speech
or
questioning
looks
,
*NL*
and
recovering
her
air
of
proud
self-dependence
whenever
she
was
under
*NL*
observation
,
choosing
her
decent
lodging
at
night
,
and
dressing
herself
*NL*
neatly
in
the
morning
,
and
setting
off
on
her
way
steadily
,
or
remaining
*NL*
under
shelter
if
it
rained
,
as
if
she
had
a
happy
life
to
cherish
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
even
in
her
most
self-conscious
moments
,
the
face
was
sadly
*NL*
different
from
that
which
had
smiled
at
itself
in
the
old
specked
glass
,
*NL*
or
smiled
at
others
when
they
glanced
at
it
admiringly
.
A
hard
and
even
*NL*
fierce
look
had
come
in
the
eyes
,
though
their
lashes
were
as
long
as
*NL*
ever
,
and
they
had
all
their
dark
brightness
.
And
the
cheek
was
never
*NL*
dimpled
with
smiles
now
.
It
was
the
same
rounded
,
pouting
,
childish
*NL*
prettiness
,
but
with
all
love
and
belief
in
love
departed
from
it
--
the
*NL*
sadder
for
its
beauty
,
like
that
wondrous
Medusa-face
,
with
the
*NL*
passionate
,
passionless
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
was
among
the
fields
she
had
been
dreaming
of
,
on
a
long
*NL*
narrow
pathway
leading
towards
a
wood
.
If
there
should
be
a
pool
in
that
*NL*
wood
!
It
would
be
better
hidden
than
one
in
the
fields
.
No
,
it
was
not
a
*NL*
wood
,
only
a
wild
brake
,
where
there
had
once
been
gravel-pits
,
leaving
*NL*
mounds
and
hollows
studded
with
brushwood
and
small
trees
.
She
roamed
up
*NL*
and
down
,
thinking
there
was
perhaps
a
pool
in
every
hollow
before
she
*NL*
came
to
it
,
till
her
limbs
were
weary
,
and
she
sat
down
to
rest
.
The
*NL*
afternoon
was
far
advanced
,
and
the
leaden
sky
was
darkening
,
as
if
the
*NL*
sun
were
setting
behind
it
.
After
a
little
while
Hetty
started
up
again
,
*NL*
feeling
that
darkness
would
soon
come
on
;
and
she
must
put
off
finding
*NL*
the
pool
till
to-morrow
,
and
make
her
way
to
some
shelter
for
the
night
.
*NL*
She
had
quite
lost
her
way
in
the
fields
,
and
might
as
well
go
in
one
*NL*
direction
as
another
,
for
aught
she
knew
.
She
walked
through
field
after
*NL*
field
,
and
no
village
,
no
house
was
in
sight
;
but
there
,
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
this
pasture
,
there
was
a
break
in
the
hedges
;
the
land
seemed
to
*NL*
dip
down
a
little
,
and
two
trees
leaned
towards
each
other
across
the
*NL*
opening
.
Hetty
's
heart
gave
a
great
beat
as
she
thought
there
must
be
*NL*
a
pool
there
.
She
walked
towards
it
heavily
over
the
tufted
grass
,
with
*NL*
pale
lips
and
a
sense
of
trembling
.
It
was
as
if
the
thing
were
come
in
*NL*
spite
of
herself
,
instead
of
being
the
object
of
her
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
it
was
,
black
under
the
darkening
sky
:
no
motion
,
no
sound
near
.
*NL*
She
set
down
her
basket
,
and
then
sank
down
herself
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
trembling
.
The
pool
had
its
wintry
depth
now
:
by
the
time
it
got
*NL*
shallow
,
as
she
remembered
the
pools
did
at
Hayslope
,
in
the
summer
,
*NL*
no
one
could
find
out
that
it
was
her
body
.
But
then
there
was
her
*NL*
basket
--
she
must
hide
that
too
.
She
must
throw
it
into
the
water
--
make
*NL*
it
heavy
with
stones
first
,
and
then
throw
it
in
.
She
got
up
to
look
*NL*
about
for
stones
,
and
soon
brought
five
or
six
,
which
she
laid
down
*NL*
beside
her
basket
,
and
then
sat
down
again
.
There
was
no
need
to
*NL*
hurry
--
there
was
all
the
night
to
drown
herself
in
.
She
sat
leaning
her
*NL*
elbow
on
the
basket
.
She
was
weary
,
hungry
.
There
were
some
buns
in
her
*NL*
basket
--
three
,
which
she
had
supplied
herself
with
at
the
place
where
*NL*
she
ate
her
dinner
.
She
took
them
out
now
and
ate
them
eagerly
,
and
then
*NL*
sat
still
again
,
looking
at
the
pool
.
The
soothed
sensation
that
came
*NL*
over
her
from
the
satisfaction
of
her
hunger
,
and
this
fixed
dreamy
*NL*
attitude
,
brought
on
drowsiness
,
and
presently
her
head
sank
down
on
her
*NL*
knees
.
She
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
awoke
it
was
deep
night
,
and
she
felt
chill
.
She
was
frightened
*NL*
at
this
darkness
--
frightened
at
the
long
night
before
her
.
If
she
could
*NL*
but
throw
herself
into
the
water
!
No
,
not
yet
.
She
began
to
walk
about
*NL*
that
she
might
get
warm
again
,
as
if
she
would
have
more
resolution
*NL*
then
.
Oh
how
long
the
time
was
in
that
darkness
!
The
bright
hearth
and
*NL*
the
warmth
and
the
voices
of
home
,
the
secure
uprising
and
lying
down
,
*NL*
the
familiar
fields
,
the
familiar
people
,
the
Sundays
and
holidays
with
*NL*
their
simple
joys
of
dress
and
feasting
--
all
the
sweets
of
her
young
*NL*
life
rushed
before
her
now
,
and
she
seemed
to
be
stretching
her
arms
*NL*
towards
them
across
a
great
gulf
.
She
set
her
teeth
when
she
thought
of
*NL*
Arthur
.
She
cursed
him
,
without
knowing
what
her
cursing
would
do
.
She
*NL*
wished
he
too
might
know
desolation
,
and
cold
,
and
a
life
of
shame
that
*NL*
he
dared
not
end
by
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horror
of
this
cold
,
and
darkness
,
and
solitude
--
out
of
all
human
*NL*
reach
--
became
greater
every
long
minute
.
It
was
almost
as
if
she
were
*NL*
dead
already
,
and
knew
that
she
was
dead
,
and
longed
to
get
back
to
life
*NL*
again
.
But
no
:
she
was
alive
still
;
she
had
not
taken
the
dreadful
*NL*
leap
.
She
felt
a
strange
contradictory
wretchedness
and
exultation
:
*NL*
wretchedness
,
that
she
did
not
dare
to
face
death
;
exultation
,
that
she
*NL*
was
still
in
life
--
that
she
might
yet
know
light
and
warmth
again
.
She
*NL*
walked
backwards
and
forwards
to
warm
herself
,
beginning
to
discern
*NL*
something
of
the
objects
around
her
,
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
*NL*
the
night
--
the
darker
line
of
the
hedge
,
the
rapid
motion
of
some
living
*NL*
creature
--
perhaps
a
field-mouse
--
rushing
across
the
grass
.
She
no
longer
*NL*
felt
as
if
the
darkness
hedged
her
in
.
She
thought
she
could
walk
back
*NL*
across
the
field
,
and
get
over
the
stile
;
and
then
,
in
the
very
next
*NL*
field
,
she
thought
she
remembered
there
was
a
hovel
of
furze
near
a
*NL*
sheepfold
.
If
she
could
get
into
that
hovel
,
she
would
be
warmer
.
She
*NL*
could
pass
the
night
there
,
for
that
was
what
Alick
did
at
Hayslope
*NL*
in
lambing-time
.
The
thought
of
this
hovel
brought
the
energy
of
a
new
*NL*
hope
.
She
took
up
her
basket
and
walked
across
the
field
,
but
it
was
*NL*
some
time
before
she
got
in
the
right
direction
for
the
stile
.
The
*NL*
exercise
and
the
occupation
of
finding
the
stile
were
a
stimulus
to
her
,
*NL*
however
,
and
lightened
the
horror
of
the
darkness
and
solitude
.
There
*NL*
were
sheep
in
the
next
field
,
and
she
startled
a
group
as
she
set
down
*NL*
her
basket
and
got
over
the
stile
;
and
the
sound
of
their
movement
*NL*
comforted
her
,
for
it
assured
her
that
her
impression
was
right
--
this
*NL*
was
the
field
where
she
had
seen
the
hovel
,
for
it
was
the
field
where
*NL*
the
sheep
were
.
Right
on
along
the
path
,
and
she
would
get
to
it
.
She
*NL*
reached
the
opposite
gate
,
and
felt
her
way
along
its
rails
and
the
*NL*
rails
of
the
sheep-fold
,
till
her
hand
encountered
the
pricking
of
the
*NL*
gorsy
wall
.
Delicious
sensation
!
She
had
found
the
shelter
.
She
groped
*NL*
her
way
,
touching
the
prickly
gorse
,
to
the
door
,
and
pushed
it
open
.
*NL*
It
was
an
ill-smelling
close
place
,
but
warm
,
and
there
was
straw
on
*NL*
the
ground
.
Hetty
sank
down
on
the
straw
with
a
sense
of
escape
.
Tears
*NL*
came
--
she
had
never
shed
tears
before
since
she
left
Windsor
--
tears
and
*NL*
sobs
of
hysterical
joy
that
she
had
still
hold
of
life
,
that
she
*NL*
was
still
on
the
familiar
earth
,
with
the
sheep
near
her
.
The
very
*NL*
consciousness
of
her
own
limbs
was
a
delight
to
her
:
she
turned
up
her
*NL*
sleeves
,
and
kissed
her
arms
with
the
passionate
love
of
life
.
Soon
*NL*
warmth
and
weariness
lulled
her
in
the
midst
of
her
sobs
,
and
she
fell
*NL*
continually
into
dozing
,
fancying
herself
at
the
brink
of
the
pool
*NL*
again
--
fancying
that
she
had
jumped
into
the
water
,
and
then
awaking
*NL*
with
a
start
,
and
wondering
where
she
was
.
But
at
last
deep
dreamless
*NL*
sleep
came
;
her
head
,
guarded
by
her
bonnet
,
found
a
pillow
against
*NL*
the
gorsy
wall
,
and
the
poor
soul
,
driven
to
and
fro
between
two
equal
*NL*
terrors
,
found
the
one
relief
that
was
possible
to
it
--
the
relief
of
*NL*
unconsciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
That
relief
seems
to
end
the
moment
it
has
begun
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
Hetty
as
if
those
dozen
dreams
had
only
passed
into
another
dream
--
that
*NL*
she
was
in
the
hovel
,
and
her
aunt
was
standing
over
her
with
a
candle
*NL*
in
her
hand
.
She
trembled
under
her
aunt
's
glance
,
and
opened
her
eyes
.
*NL*
There
was
no
candle
,
but
there
was
light
in
the
hovel
--
the
light
of
*NL*
early
morning
through
the
open
door
.
And
there
was
a
face
looking
down
*NL*
on
her
;
but
it
was
an
unknown
face
,
belonging
to
an
elderly
man
in
a
*NL*
smock-frock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
do
here
,
young
woman
?
''
the
man
said
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
trembled
still
worse
under
this
real
fear
and
shame
than
she
had
*NL*
done
in
her
momentary
dream
under
her
aunt
's
glance
.
She
felt
that
she
*NL*
was
like
a
beggar
already
--
found
sleeping
in
that
place
.
But
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
trembling
,
she
was
so
eager
to
account
to
the
man
for
her
presence
*NL*
here
,
that
she
found
words
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lost
my
way
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
travelling
--
north
`
ard
,
and
I
got
away
*NL*
from
the
road
into
the
fields
,
and
was
overtaken
by
the
dark
.
Will
you
*NL*
tell
me
the
way
to
the
nearest
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
up
as
she
was
speaking
,
and
put
her
hands
to
her
bonnet
to
*NL*
adjust
it
,
and
then
laid
hold
of
her
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
at
her
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
without
giving
her
any
*NL*
answer
,
for
some
seconds
.
Then
he
turned
away
and
walked
towards
the
*NL*
door
of
the
hovel
,
but
it
was
not
till
he
got
there
that
he
stood
still
,
*NL*
and
,
turning
his
shoulder
half-round
towards
her
,
said
,
``
Aw
,
I
can
show
*NL*
you
the
way
to
Norton
,
if
you
like
.
But
what
do
you
do
gettin
'
out
o
'
*NL*
the
highroad
?
''
he
added
,
with
a
tone
of
gruff
reproof
.
``
Y'
ull
be
gettin
'
*NL*
into
mischief
,
if
you
dooant
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
,
``
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
I
'll
keep
in
the
road
,
if
*NL*
you
'll
be
so
good
as
show
me
how
to
get
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
dooant
you
keep
where
there
's
a
finger-poasses
an
'
folks
to
ax
the
*NL*
way
on
?
''
the
man
said
,
still
more
gruffly
.
``
Anybody
`
ud
think
you
was
a
*NL*
wild
woman
,
an
'
look
at
yer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
frightened
at
this
gruff
old
man
,
and
still
more
at
this
last
*NL*
suggestion
that
she
looked
like
a
wild
woman
.
As
she
followed
him
out
of
*NL*
the
hovel
she
thought
she
would
give
him
a
sixpence
for
telling
her
the
*NL*
way
,
and
then
he
would
not
suppose
she
was
wild
.
As
he
stopped
to
point
*NL*
out
the
road
to
her
,
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
to
get
the
six-pence
*NL*
ready
,
and
when
he
was
turning
away
,
without
saying
good-morning
,
*NL*
she
held
it
out
to
him
and
said
,
``
Thank
you
;
will
you
please
to
take
*NL*
something
for
your
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
slowly
at
the
sixpence
,
and
then
said
,
``
I
want
none
o
'
your
*NL*
money
.
You
'd
better
take
care
o
n't
,
else
you
'll
get
it
stool
from
yer
,
*NL*
if
you
go
trapesin
'
about
the
fields
like
a
mad
woman
a-thatway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
left
her
without
further
speech
,
and
Hetty
held
on
her
way
.
*NL*
Another
day
had
risen
,
and
she
must
wander
on
.
It
was
no
use
to
think
of
*NL*
drowning
herself
--
she
could
not
do
it
,
at
least
while
she
had
money
left
*NL*
to
buy
food
and
strength
to
journey
on
.
But
the
incident
on
her
waking
*NL*
this
morning
heightened
her
dread
of
that
time
when
her
money
would
be
*NL*
all
gone
;
she
would
have
to
sell
her
basket
and
clothes
then
,
and
she
*NL*
would
really
look
like
a
beggar
or
a
wild
woman
,
as
the
man
had
said
.
*NL*
The
passionate
joy
in
life
she
had
felt
in
the
night
,
after
escaping
*NL*
from
the
brink
of
the
black
cold
death
in
the
pool
,
was
gone
now
.
*NL*
Life
now
,
by
the
morning
light
,
with
the
impression
of
that
man
's
hard
*NL*
wondering
look
at
her
,
was
as
full
of
dread
as
death
--
it
was
worse
;
it
*NL*
was
a
dread
to
which
she
felt
chained
,
from
which
she
shrank
and
shrank
*NL*
as
she
did
from
the
black
pool
,
and
yet
could
find
no
refuge
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
out
her
money
from
her
purse
,
and
looked
at
it
.
She
had
still
*NL*
two-and-twenty
shillings
;
it
would
serve
her
for
many
days
more
,
or
it
*NL*
would
help
her
to
get
on
faster
to
Stonyshire
,
within
reach
of
*NL*
Dinah
.
The
thought
of
Dinah
urged
itself
more
strongly
now
,
since
the
*NL*
experience
of
the
night
had
driven
her
shuddering
imagination
away
from
*NL*
the
pool
.
If
it
had
been
only
going
to
Dinah
--
if
nobody
besides
Dinah
*NL*
would
ever
know
--
Hetty
could
have
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
her
.
The
*NL*
soft
voice
,
the
pitying
eyes
,
would
have
drawn
her
.
But
afterwards
the
*NL*
other
people
must
know
,
and
she
could
no
more
rush
on
that
shame
than
*NL*
she
could
rush
on
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
must
wander
on
and
on
,
and
wait
for
a
lower
depth
of
despair
to
give
*NL*
her
courage
.
Perhaps
death
would
come
to
her
,
for
she
was
getting
less
*NL*
and
less
able
to
bear
the
day
's
weariness
.
And
yet
--
such
is
the
strange
*NL*
action
of
our
souls
,
drawing
us
by
a
lurking
desire
towards
the
very
*NL*
ends
we
dread
--
Hetty
,
when
she
set
out
again
from
Norton
,
asked
the
*NL*
straightest
road
northwards
towards
Stonyshire
,
and
kept
it
all
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
wandering
Hetty
,
with
the
rounded
childish
face
and
the
hard
,
*NL*
unloving
,
despairing
soul
looking
out
of
it
--
with
the
narrow
heart
*NL*
and
narrow
thoughts
,
no
room
in
them
for
any
sorrows
but
her
own
,
and
*NL*
tasting
that
sorrow
with
the
more
intense
bitterness
!
My
heart
bleeds
*NL*
for
her
as
I
see
her
toiling
along
on
her
weary
feet
,
or
seated
in
*NL*
a
cart
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
road
before
her
,
never
*NL*
thinking
or
caring
whither
it
tends
,
till
hunger
comes
and
makes
her
*NL*
desire
that
a
village
may
be
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
will
be
the
end
,
the
end
of
her
objectless
wandering
,
apart
from
*NL*
all
love
,
caring
for
human
beings
only
through
her
pride
,
clinging
to
*NL*
life
only
as
the
hunted
wounded
brute
clings
to
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
God
preserve
you
and
me
from
being
the
beginners
of
such
misery
!

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
Quest
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
first
ten
days
after
Hetty
's
departure
passed
as
quietly
as
any
*NL*
other
days
with
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
with
Adam
at
his
daily
*NL*
work
.
They
had
expected
Hetty
to
stay
away
a
week
or
ten
days
at
least
,
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
longer
if
Dinah
came
back
with
her
,
because
there
might
*NL*
then
be
something
to
detain
them
at
Snowfield
.
But
when
a
fortnight
had
*NL*
passed
they
began
to
feel
a
little
surprise
that
Hetty
did
not
return
;
*NL*
she
must
surely
have
found
it
pleasanter
to
be
with
Dinah
than
any
one
*NL*
could
have
supposed
.
Adam
,
for
his
part
,
was
getting
very
impatient
*NL*
to
see
her
,
and
he
resolved
that
,
if
she
did
not
appear
the
next
day
*NL*
-LRB-
Saturday
-RRB-
,
he
would
set
out
on
Sunday
morning
to
fetch
her
.
There
*NL*
was
no
coach
on
a
Sunday
,
but
by
setting
out
before
it
was
light
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
getting
a
lift
in
a
cart
by
the
way
,
he
would
arrive
pretty
*NL*
early
at
Snowfield
,
and
bring
back
Hetty
the
next
day
--
Dinah
too
,
if
she
*NL*
were
coming
.
It
was
quite
time
Hetty
came
home
,
and
he
would
afford
to
*NL*
lose
his
Monday
for
the
sake
of
bringing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
project
was
quite
approved
at
the
Farm
when
he
went
there
on
*NL*
Saturday
evening
.
Mrs.
Poyser
desired
him
emphatically
not
to
come
back
*NL*
without
Hetty
,
for
she
had
been
quite
too
long
away
,
considering
the
*NL*
things
she
had
to
get
ready
by
the
middle
of
March
,
and
a
week
was
*NL*
surely
enough
for
any
one
to
go
out
for
their
health
.
As
for
Dinah
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
had
small
hope
of
their
bringing
her
,
unless
they
could
make
her
*NL*
believe
the
folks
at
Hayslope
were
twice
as
miserable
as
the
folks
at
*NL*
Snowfield
.
``
Though
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
by
way
of
conclusion
,
``
you
might
*NL*
tell
her
she
's
got
but
one
aunt
left
,
and
SHE
'S
wasted
pretty
nigh
to
*NL*
a
shadder
;
and
we
shall
p
`
rhaps
all
be
gone
twenty
mile
farther
off
her
*NL*
next
Michaelmas
,
and
shall
die
o
'
broken
hearts
among
strange
folks
,
and
*NL*
leave
the
children
fatherless
and
motherless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
certainly
had
the
air
of
a
man
*NL*
perfectly
heart-whole
,
``
it
isna
so
bad
as
that
.
Thee
'
t
looking
rarely
*NL*
now
,
and
getting
flesh
every
day
.
But
I
'd
be
glad
for
Dinah
t
'
come
,
for
*NL*
she
'd
help
thee
wi
'
the
little
uns
:
they
took
t
'
her
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
at
daybreak
,
on
Sunday
,
Adam
set
off
.
Seth
went
with
him
the
first
*NL*
mile
or
two
,
for
the
thought
of
Snowfield
and
the
possibility
that
Dinah
*NL*
might
come
again
made
him
restless
,
and
the
walk
with
Adam
in
the
cold
*NL*
morning
air
,
both
in
their
best
clothes
,
helped
to
give
him
a
sense
of
*NL*
Sunday
calm
.
It
was
the
last
morning
in
February
,
with
a
low
grey
sky
,
*NL*
and
a
slight
hoar-frost
on
the
green
border
of
the
road
and
on
the
black
*NL*
hedges
.
They
heard
the
gurgling
of
the
full
brooklet
hurrying
down
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
the
faint
twittering
of
the
early
birds
.
For
they
walked
in
*NL*
silence
,
though
with
a
pleased
sense
of
companionship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
lad
,
''
said
Adam
,
laying
his
hand
on
Seth
's
shoulder
and
*NL*
looking
at
him
affectionately
as
they
were
about
to
part
.
``
I
wish
thee
*NL*
wast
going
all
the
way
wi
'
me
,
and
as
happy
as
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
content
,
Addy
,
I
'm
content
,
''
said
Seth
cheerfully
.
``
I
'll
be
an
old
*NL*
bachelor
,
belike
,
and
make
a
fuss
wi
'
thy
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
'
y
turned
away
from
each
other
,
and
Seth
walked
leisurely
homeward
,
*NL*
mentally
repeating
one
of
his
favourite
hymns
--
he
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
hymns
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dark
and
cheerless
is
the
morn
*NL*
Unaccompanied
by
thee
:
*NL*
Joyless
is
the
day
's
return
*NL*
Till
thy
mercy
's
beams
I
see
:
*NL*
Till
thou
inward
light
impart
,
*NL*
Glad
my
eyes
and
warm
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Visit
,
then
,
this
soul
of
mine
,
*NL*
Pierce
the
gloom
of
sin
and
grief
--
*NL*
Fill
me
,
Radiancy
Divine
,
*NL*
Scatter
all
my
unbelief
.
*NL*
More
and
more
thyself
display
,
*NL*
Shining
to
the
perfect
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
walked
much
faster
,
and
any
one
coming
along
the
Oakbourne
road
*NL*
at
sunrise
that
morning
must
have
had
a
pleasant
sight
in
this
tall
*NL*
broad-chested
man
,
striding
along
with
a
carriage
as
upright
and
firm
*NL*
as
any
soldier
's
,
glancing
with
keen
glad
eyes
at
the
dark-blue
hills
as
*NL*
they
began
to
show
themselves
on
his
way
.
Seldom
in
Adam
's
life
had
his
*NL*
face
been
so
free
from
any
cloud
of
anxiety
as
it
was
this
morning
;
and
*NL*
this
freedom
from
care
,
as
is
usual
with
constructive
practical
minds
*NL*
like
his
,
made
him
all
the
more
observant
of
the
objects
round
him
*NL*
and
all
the
more
ready
to
gather
suggestions
from
them
towards
his
*NL*
own
favourite
plans
and
ingenious
contrivances
.
His
happy
love
--
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
his
steps
were
carrying
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
Hetty
,
*NL*
who
was
so
soon
to
be
his
--
was
to
his
thoughts
what
the
sweet
morning
*NL*
air
was
to
his
sensations
:
it
gave
him
a
consciousness
of
well-being
*NL*
that
made
activity
delightful
.
Every
now
and
then
there
was
a
rush
of
*NL*
more
intense
feeling
towards
her
,
which
chased
away
other
images
than
*NL*
Hetty
;
and
along
with
that
would
come
a
wondering
thankfulness
that
*NL*
all
this
happiness
was
given
to
him
--
that
this
life
of
ours
had
such
*NL*
sweetness
in
it
.
For
Adam
had
a
devout
mind
,
though
he
was
perhaps
*NL*
rather
impatient
of
devout
words
,
and
his
tenderness
lay
very
close
*NL*
to
his
reverence
,
so
that
the
one
could
hardly
be
stirred
without
the
*NL*
other
.
But
after
feeling
had
welled
up
and
poured
itself
out
in
this
*NL*
way
,
busy
thought
would
come
back
with
the
greater
vigour
;
and
this
*NL*
morning
it
was
intent
on
schemes
by
which
the
roads
might
be
improved
*NL*
that
were
so
imperfect
all
through
the
country
,
and
on
picturing
all
*NL*
the
benefits
that
might
come
from
the
exertions
of
a
single
country
*NL*
gentleman
,
if
he
would
set
himself
to
getting
the
roads
made
good
in
his
*NL*
own
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
a
very
short
walk
,
the
ten
miles
to
Oakbourne
,
that
pretty
*NL*
town
within
sight
of
the
blue
hills
,
where
he
break-fasted
.
After
*NL*
this
,
the
country
grew
barer
and
barer
:
no
more
rolling
woods
,
no
more
*NL*
wide-branching
trees
near
frequent
homesteads
,
no
more
bushy
hedgerows
,
*NL*
but
greystone
walls
intersecting
the
meagre
pastures
,
and
dismal
*NL*
wide-scattered
greystone
houses
on
broken
lands
where
mines
had
been
and
*NL*
were
no
longer
.
``
A
hungry
land
,
''
said
Adam
to
himself
.
``
I
'd
rather
go
*NL*
south
`
ard
,
where
they
say
it
's
as
flat
as
a
table
,
than
come
to
live
*NL*
here
;
though
if
Dinah
likes
to
live
in
a
country
where
she
can
be
the
*NL*
most
comfort
to
folks
,
she
's
i
'
the
right
to
live
o
'
this
side
;
for
she
*NL*
must
look
as
if
she
'd
come
straight
from
heaven
,
like
th
'
angels
in
the
*NL*
desert
,
to
strengthen
them
as
ha
'
got
nothing
t
'
eat
.
''
And
when
at
last
*NL*
he
came
in
sight
of
Snowfield
,
he
thought
it
looked
like
a
town
that
was
*NL*
``
fellow
to
the
country
,
''
though
the
stream
through
the
valley
where
the
*NL*
great
mill
stood
gave
a
pleasant
greenness
to
the
lower
fields
.
The
town
*NL*
lay
,
grim
,
stony
,
and
unsheltered
,
up
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
,
and
Adam
*NL*
did
not
go
forward
to
it
at
present
,
for
Seth
had
told
him
where
to
find
*NL*
Dinah
.
It
was
at
a
thatched
cottage
outside
the
town
,
a
little
way
from
*NL*
the
mill
--
an
old
cottage
,
standing
sideways
towards
the
road
,
with
a
*NL*
little
bit
of
potato-ground
before
it
.
Here
Dinah
lodged
with
an
elderly
*NL*
couple
;
and
if
she
and
Hetty
happened
to
be
out
,
Adam
could
learn
where
*NL*
they
were
gone
,
or
when
they
would
be
at
home
again
.
Dinah
might
be
out
*NL*
on
some
preaching
errand
,
and
perhaps
she
would
have
left
Hetty
at
home
.
*NL*
Adam
could
not
help
hoping
this
,
and
as
he
recognized
the
cottage
by
the
*NL*
roadside
before
him
,
there
shone
out
in
his
face
that
involuntary
smile
*NL*
which
belongs
to
the
expectation
of
a
near
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
his
step
along
the
narrow
causeway
,
and
rapped
at
the
door
.
*NL*
It
was
opened
by
a
very
clean
old
woman
,
with
a
slow
palsied
shake
of
*NL*
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Dinah
Morris
at
home
?
''
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
...
no
,
''
said
the
old
woman
,
looking
up
at
this
tall
stranger
with
*NL*
a
wonder
that
made
her
slower
of
speech
than
usual
.
``
Will
you
please
to
*NL*
come
in
?
''
she
added
,
retiring
from
the
door
,
as
if
recollecting
herself
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
ye
're
brother
to
the
young
man
as
come
afore
,
arena
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Adam
,
entering
.
``
That
was
Seth
Bede
.
I
'm
his
brother
Adam
.
*NL*
He
told
me
to
give
his
respects
to
you
and
your
good
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
the
same

'
him
.
He
was
a
gracious
young
man

*NL*
on

Sit

down
i
'
th
'
arm-chair
.
My
man
isna
come
home
*NL*
from
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
sat
down
patiently
,
not
liking
to
hurry
the
shaking
old
woman
with
*NL*
questions
,
but
looking
eagerly
towards
the
narrow
twisting
stairs
in
one
*NL*
corner
,
for
he
thought
it
was
possible
Hetty
might
have
heard
his
voice
*NL*
and
would
come
down
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
come
to
see
Dinah
Morris
?
''
said
the
old
woman
,
standing
*NL*
opposite
to
him
.
``
An
'
you
didn
'
know
she
was
away
from
home
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
but
I
thought
it
likely
she
might
be
away
,
seeing
as
*NL*
it
's
Sunday
.
But
the
other
young
woman
--
is
she
at
home
,
or
gone
along
*NL*
with
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
looked
at
Adam
with
a
bewildered
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
along
wi
'
her
?
''
she
said
.
``
Eh
,
Dinah
's
gone
to
Leeds
,
a
big
town
*NL*
ye
may
ha
'
heared
on

where
there
's
a
many
o
'
the
Lord
's
people
.
She
's
*NL*
been
gone
sin
'
Friday
was
a
fortnight
:
they
sent
her
the
money
for
her
*NL*
journey
.
You
may
see
her
room
here
,
''
she
went
on
,
opening
a
door
and
not
*NL*
noticing
the
effect
of
her
words
on
Adam
.
He
rose
and
followed
her
,
and
*NL*
darted
an
eager
glance
into
the
little
room
with
its
narrow
bed
,
the
*NL*
portrait
of
Wesley
on
the
wall
,
and
the
few
books
lying
on
the
large
*NL*
Bible
.
He
had
had
an
irrational
hope
that
Hetty
might
be
there
.
He
could
*NL*
not
speak
in
the
first
moment
after
seeing
that
the
room
was
empty
;
an
*NL*
undefined
fear
had
seized
him
--
something
had
happened
to
Hetty
on
the
*NL*
journey
.
Still
the
old
woman
was
so
slow
of
speech
and
apprehension
,
*NL*
that
Hetty
might
be
at
Snowfield
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
ye
didna
know
,
''
she
said
.
``
Have
ye
come
from
your
own
*NL*
country

purpose
to
see
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Hetty

Hetty
Sorrel

said
Adam
,
abruptly
;
``
Where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nobody
by
that
name

''
said
the
old
woman
,
wonderingly
.
``
Is

anybody

've
heared
on
at
Snowfield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did

young

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

hair

and
a
red
cloak
on

and
a
basket
on

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
had
seen
the
ghastly
look
of
fear
in
Adam
's
face
.
But
he
*NL*
was
not
stunned
or
confounded
:
he
was
thinking
eagerly
where
he
could
*NL*
inquire
about
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
a
young
woman
started
from
our
country

to

back

to
her

I
ca
n't
stop

Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
out
of
the
cottage
,
and
the
old
woman
followed
him
to
the
*NL*
gate
,
watching
him
sadly
with
her
shaking
head
as
he
almost
ran
towards
*NL*
the
town
.
He
was
going
to
inquire
at
the
place
where
the
Oakbourne
coach
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
!
No
young
woman
like
Hetty
had
been
seen
there
.
Had
any
accident
*NL*
happened
to
the
coach
a
fortnight
ago
?
No
.
And
there
was
no
coach
to
*NL*
take
him
back
to
Oakbourne
that
day
.
Well
,
he
would
walk
:
he
could
n't
*NL*
stay
here
,
in
wretched
inaction
.
But
the
innkeeper
,
seeing
that
Adam
was
*NL*
in
great
anxiety
,
and
entering
into
this
new
incident
with
the
eagerness
*NL*
of
a
man
who
passes
a
great
deal
of
time
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
*NL*
looking
into
an
obstinately
monotonous
street
,
offered
to
take
him
back
*NL*
to
Oakbourne
in
his
own
``
taxed
cart
''
this
very
evening
.
It
was
not
five
*NL*
o'clock
;
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
Adam
to
take
a
meal
and
yet
to
get
*NL*
to
Oakbourne
before
ten
o'clock
.
The
innkeeper
declared
that
he
really
*NL*
wanted
to
go
to
Oakbourne
,
and
might
as
well
go
to-night
;
he
should
have
*NL*
all
Monday
before
him
then
.
Adam
,
after
making
an
ineffectual
attempt
*NL*
to
eat
,
put
the
food
in
his
pocket
,
and
,
drinking
a
draught
of
ale
,
*NL*
declared
himself
ready
to
set
off
.
As
they
approached
the
cottage
,
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
learn
from
the
old
woman
*NL*
where
Dinah
was
to
be
found
in
Leeds
:
if
there
was
trouble
at
the
Hall
*NL*
Farm
--
he
only
half-admitted
the
foreboding
that
there
would
be
--
the
*NL*
Poysers
might
like
to
send
for
Dinah
.
But
Dinah
had
not
left
any
*NL*
address
,
and
the
old
woman
,
whose
memory
for
names
was
infirm
,
could
not
*NL*
recall
the
name
of
the
``
blessed
woman
''
who
was
Dinah
's
chief
friend
in
*NL*
the
Society
at
Leeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
long
,
long
journey
in
the
taxed
cart
,
there
was
time
for
*NL*
all
the
conjectures
of
importunate
fear
and
struggling
hope
.
In
the
very
*NL*
first
shock
of
discovering
that
Hetty
had
not
been
to
Snowfield
,
the
*NL*
thought
of
Arthur
had
darted
through
Adam
like
a
sharp
pang
,
but
he
*NL*
tried
for
some
time
to
ward
off
its
return
by
busying
himself
with
modes
*NL*
of
accounting
for
the
alarming
fact
,
quite
apart
from
that
intolerable
*NL*
thought
.
Some
accident
had
happened
.
Hetty
had
,
by
some
strange
chance
,
*NL*
got
into
a
wrong
vehicle
from
Oakbourne
:
she
had
been
taken
ill
,
and
did
*NL*
not
want
to
frighten
them
by
letting
them
know
.
But
this
frail
fence
*NL*
of
vague
improbabilities
was
soon
hurled
down
by
a
rush
of
distinct
*NL*
agonizing
fears
.
Hetty
had
been
deceiving
herself
in
thinking
that
she
*NL*
could
love
and
marry
him
:
she
had
been
loving
Arthur
all
the
while
;
and
*NL*
now
,
in
her
desperation
at
the
nearness
of
their
marriage
,
she
had
run
*NL*
away
.
And
she
was
gone
to
him
.
The
old
indignation
and
jealousy
*NL*
rose
again
,
and
prompted
the
suspicion
that
Arthur
had
been
dealing
*NL*
falsely
--
had
written
to
Hetty
--
had
tempted
her
to
come
to
him
--
being
*NL*
unwilling
,
after
all
,
that
she
should
belong
to
another
man
besides
*NL*
himself
.
Perhaps
the
whole
thing
had
been
contrived
by
him
,
and
he
had
*NL*
given
her
directions
how
to
follow
him
to
Ireland
--
for
Adam
knew
that
*NL*
Arthur
had
been
gone
thither
three
weeks
ago
,
having
recently
learnt
it
*NL*
at
the
Chase
.
Every
sad
look
of
Hetty
's
,
since
she
had
been
engaged
*NL*
to
Adam
,
returned
upon
him
now
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
painful
*NL*
retrospect
.
He
had
been
foolishly
sanguine
and
confident
.
The
poor
thing
*NL*
had
n't
perhaps
known
her
own
mind
for
a
long
while
;
had
thought
that
*NL*
she
could
forget
Arthur
;
had
been
momentarily
drawn
towards
the
man
who
*NL*
offered
her
a
protecting
,
faithful
love
.
He
could
n't
bear
to
blame
her
:
*NL*
she
never
meant
to
cause
him
this
dreadful
pain
.
The
blame
lay
with
*NL*
that
man
who
had
selfishly
played
with
her
heart
--
had
perhaps
even
*NL*
deliberately
lured
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Oakbourne
,
the
ostler
at
the
Royal
Oak
remembered
such
a
young
woman
*NL*
as
Adam
described
getting
out
of
the
Treddleston
coach
more
than
a
*NL*
fortnight
ago
--
was
n't
likely
to
forget
such
a
pretty
lass
as
that
in
*NL*
a
hurry
--
was
sure
she
had
not
gone
on
by
the
Buxton
coach
that
went
*NL*
through
Snowfield
,
but
had
lost
sight
of
her
while
he
went
away
with
the
*NL*
horses
and
had
never
set
eyes
on
her
again
.
Adam
then
went
straight
to
*NL*
the
house
from
which
the
Stonition
coach
started
:
Stoniton
was
the
*NL*
most
obvious
place
for
Hetty
to
go
to
first
,
whatever
might
be
*NL*
her
destination
,
for
she
would
hardly
venture
on
any
but
the
chief
*NL*
coach-roads
.
She
had
been
noticed
here
too
,
and
was
remembered
to
have
*NL*
sat
on
the
box
by
the
coachman
;
but
the
coachman
could
not
be
seen
,
for
*NL*
another
man
had
been
driving
on
that
road
in
his
stead
the
last
three
or
*NL*
four
days
.
He
could
probably
be
seen
at
Stoniton
,
through
inquiry
at
the
*NL*
inn
where
the
coach
put
up
.
So
the
anxious
heart-stricken
Adam
must
of
*NL*
necessity
wait
and
try
to
rest
till
morning
--
nay
,
till
eleven
o'clock
,
*NL*
when
the
coach
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Stoniton
another
delay
occurred
,
for
the
old
coachman
who
had
driven
*NL*
Hetty
would
not
be
in
the
town
again
till
night
.
When
he
did
come
he
*NL*
remembered
Hetty
well
,
and
remembered
his
own
joke
addressed
to
her
,
*NL*
quoting
it
many
times
to
Adam
,
and
observing
with
equal
frequency
that
*NL*
he
thought
there
was
something
more
than
common
,
because
Hetty
had
not
*NL*
laughed
when
he
joked
her
.
But
he
declared
,
as
the
people
had
done
at
*NL*
the
inn
,
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
Hetty
directly
she
got
down
.
Part
of
*NL*
the
next
morning
was
consumed
in
inquiries
at
every
house
in
the
town
*NL*
from
which
a
coach
started
--
-LRB-
all
in
vain
,
for
you
know
Hetty
did
not
*NL*
start
from
Stonition
by
coach
,
but
on
foot
in
the
grey
morning
-RRB-
--
and
*NL*
then
in
walking
out
to
the
first
toll-gates
on
the
different
lines
of
*NL*
road
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
finding
some
recollection
of
her
there
.
No
,
*NL*
she
was
not
to
be
traced
any
farther
;
and
the
next
hard
task
for
Adam
*NL*
was
to
go
home
and
carry
the
wretched
tidings
to
the
Hall
Farm
.
As
to
*NL*
what
he
should
do
beyond
that
,
he
had
come
to
two
distinct
resolutions
*NL*
amidst
the
tumult
of
thought
and
feeling
which
was
going
on
within
him
*NL*
while
he
went
to
and
fro
.
He
would
not
mention
what
he
knew
of
Arthur
*NL*
Donnithorne
's
behaviour
to
Hetty
till
there
was
a
clear
necessity
for
*NL*
it
:
it
was
still
possible
Hetty
might
come
back
,
and
the
disclosure
*NL*
might
be
an
injury
or
an
offence
to
her
.
And
as
soon
as
he
had
been
home
*NL*
and
done
what
was
necessary
there
to
prepare
for
his
further
absence
,
he
*NL*
would
start
off
to
Ireland
:
if
he
found
no
trace
of
Hetty
on
the
road
,
*NL*
he
would
go
straight
to
Arthur
Donnithorne
and
make
himself
certain
*NL*
how
far
he
was
acquainted
with
her
movements
.
Several
times
the
thought
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
consult
Mr.
Irwine
,
but
that
would
be
*NL*
useless
unless
he
told
him
all
,
and
so
betrayed
the
secret
about
Arthur
.
*NL*
It
seems
strange
that
Adam
,
in
the
incessant
occupation
of
his
mind
*NL*
about
Hetty
,
should
never
have
alighted
on
the
probability
that
she
had
*NL*
gone
to
Windsor
,
ignorant
that
Arthur
was
no
longer
there
.
Perhaps
the
*NL*
reason
was
that
he
could
not
conceive
Hetty
's
throwing
herself
on
Arthur
*NL*
uncalled
;
he
imagined
no
cause
that
could
have
driven
her
to
such
*NL*
a
step
,
after
that
letter
written
in
August
.
There
were
but
two
*NL*
alternatives
in
his
mind
:
either
Arthur
had
written
to
her
again
and
*NL*
enticed
her
away
,
or
she
had
simply
fled
from
her
approaching
marriage
*NL*
with
himself
because
she
found
,
after
all
,
she
could
not
love
him
well
*NL*
enough
,
and
yet
was
afraid
of
her
friends
'
anger
if
she
retracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
last
determination
on
his
mind
,
of
going
straight
to
Arthur
,
*NL*
the
thought
that
he
had
spent
two
days
in
inquiries
which
had
proved
to
*NL*
be
almost
useless
,
was
torturing
to
Adam
;
and
yet
,
since
he
would
not
*NL*
tell
the
Poysers
his
conviction
as
to
where
Hetty
was
gone
,
or
his
*NL*
intention
to
follow
her
thither
,
he
must
be
able
to
say
to
them
that
he
*NL*
had
traced
her
as
far
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
twelve
o'clock
on
Tuesday
night
when
Adam
reached
*NL*
Treddleston
;
and
,
unwilling
to
disturb
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
also
*NL*
to
encounter
their
questions
at
that
hour
,
he
threw
himself
without
*NL*
undressing
on
a
bed
at
the
``
Waggon
Overthrown
,
''
and
slept
hard
from
pure
*NL*
weariness
.
Not
more
than
four
hours
,
however
,
for
before
five
o'clock
he
*NL*
set
out
on
his
way
home
in
the
faint
morning
twilight
.
He
always
kept
a
*NL*
key
of
the
workshop
door
in
his
pocket
,
so
that
he
could
let
himself
in
;
*NL*
and
he
wished
to
enter
without
awaking
his
mother
,
for
he
was
anxious
*NL*
to
avoid
telling
her
the
new
trouble
himself
by
seeing
Seth
first
,
and
*NL*
asking
him
to
tell
her
when
it
should
be
necessary
.
He
walked
gently
*NL*
along
the
yard
,
and
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
door
;
but
,
as
he
*NL*
expected
,
Gyp
,
who
lay
in
the
workshop
,
gave
a
sharp
bark
.
It
subsided
*NL*
when
he
saw
Adam
,
holding
up
his
finger
at
him
to
impose
silence
,
and
*NL*
in
his
dumb
,
tailless
joy
he
must
content
himself
with
rubbing
his
body
*NL*
against
his
master
's
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
too
heart-sick
to
take
notice
of
Gyp
's
fondling
.
He
threw
*NL*
himself
on
the
bench
and
stared
dully
at
the
wood
and
the
signs
of
work
*NL*
around
him
,
wondering
if
he
should
ever
come
to
feel
pleasure
in
them
*NL*
again
,
while
Gyp
,
dimly
aware
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
*NL*
master
,
laid
his
rough
grey
head
on
Adam
's
knee
and
wrinkled
his
brows
*NL*
to
look
up
at
him
.
Hitherto
,
since
Sunday
afternoon
,
Adam
had
been
*NL*
constantly
among
strange
people
and
in
strange
places
,
having
no
*NL*
associations
with
the
details
of
his
daily
life
,
and
now
that
by
the
*NL*
light
of
this
new
morning
he
was
come
back
to
his
home
and
surrounded
*NL*
by
the
familiar
objects
that
seemed
for
ever
robbed
of
their
charm
,
the
*NL*
reality
--
the
hard
,
inevitable
reality
of
his
troubles
pressed
upon
him
*NL*
with
a
new
weight
.
Right
before
him
was
an
unfinished
chest
of
drawers
,
*NL*
which
he
had
been
making
in
spare
moments
for
Hetty
's
use
,
when
his
home
*NL*
should
be
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
had
not
heard
Adam
's
entrance
,
but
he
had
been
roused
by
Gyp
's
*NL*
bark
,
and
Adam
heard
him
moving
about
in
the
room
above
,
dressing
*NL*
himself
.
Seth
's
first
thoughts
were
about
his
brother
:
he
would
come
*NL*
home
to-day
,
surely
,
for
the
business
would
be
wanting
him
sadly
by
*NL*
to-morrow
,
but
it
was
pleasant
to
think
he
had
had
a
longer
holiday
than
*NL*
he
had
expected
.
And
would
Dinah
come
too
?
Seth
felt
that
that
was
the
*NL*
greatest
happiness
he
could
look
forward
to
for
himself
,
though
he
had
*NL*
no
hope
left
that
she
would
ever
love
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
;
but
*NL*
he
had
often
said
to
himself
,
it
was
better
to
be
Dinah
's
friend
and
*NL*
brother
than
any
other
woman
's
husband
.
If
he
could
but
be
always
near
*NL*
her
,
instead
of
living
so
far
off
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
downstairs
and
opened
the
inner
door
leading
from
the
kitchen
*NL*
into
the
workshop
,
intending
to
let
out
Gyp
;
but
he
stood
still
in
*NL*
the
doorway
,
smitten
with
a
sudden
shock
at
the
sight
of
Adam
seated
*NL*
listlessly
on
the
bench
,
pale
,
unwashed
,
with
sunken
blank
eyes
,
almost
*NL*
like
a
drunkard
in
the
morning
.
But
Seth
felt
in
an
instant
what
the
*NL*
marks
meant
--
not
drunkenness
,
but
some
great
calamity
.
Adam
looked
up
at
*NL*
him
without
speaking
,
and
Seth
moved
forward
towards
the
bench
,
himself
*NL*
trembling
so
that
speech
did
not
come
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
have
mercy
on
us
,
Addy
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
sitting
down
on
*NL*
the
bench
beside
Adam
,
``
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
unable
to
speak
.
The
strong
man
,
accustomed
to
suppress
the
*NL*
signs
of
sorrow
,
had
felt
his
heart
swell
like
a
child
's
at
this
first
*NL*
approach
of
sympathy
.
He
fell
on
Seth
's
neck
and
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
prepared
for
the
worst
now
,
for
,
even
in
his
recollections
of
*NL*
their
boyhood
,
Adam
had
never
sobbed
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
death
,
Adam
?
Is
she
dead
?
''
he
asked
,
in
a
low
tone
,
when
Adam
*NL*
raised
his
head
and
was
recovering
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
lad
;
but
she
's
gone
--
gone
away
from
us
.
She
's
never
been
to
*NL*
Snowfield
.
Dinah
's
been
gone
to
Leeds
ever
since
last
Friday
was
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
the
very
day
Hetty
set
out
.
I
ca
n't
find
out
where
she
went
*NL*
after
she
got
to
Stoniton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
silent
from
utter
astonishment
:
he
knew
nothing
that
could
*NL*
suggest
to
him
a
reason
for
Hetty
's
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
any
notion
what
she
's
done
it
for
?
''
he
said
,
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
ha
'
loved
me
.
She
did
n't
like
our
marriage
when
it
came
*NL*
nigh
--
that
must
be
it
,
''
said
Adam
.
He
had
determined
to
mention
no
*NL*
further
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
Mother
stirring
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
Must
we
tell
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
yet
,
''
said
Adam
,
rising
from
the
bench
and
pushing
the
hair
*NL*
from
his
face
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
rouse
himself
.
``
I
ca
n't
have
her
told
*NL*
yet
;
and
I
must
set
out
on
another
journey
directly
,
after
I
've
been
to
*NL*
the
village
and
th
'
Hall
Farm
.
I
ca
n't
tell
thee
where
I
'm
going
,
and
*NL*
thee
must
say
to
her
I
'm
gone
on
business
as
nobody
is
to
know
anything
*NL*
about
.
I
'll
go
and
wash
myself
now
.
''
Adam
moved
towards
the
door
of
the
*NL*
workshop
,
but
after
a
step
or
two
he
turned
round
,
and
,
meeting
Seth
's
*NL*
eyes
with
a
calm
sad
glance
,
he
said
,
``
I
must
take
all
the
money
out
*NL*
o
'
the
tin
box
,
lad
;
but
if
anything
happens
to
me
,
all
the
rest
'll
be
*NL*
thine
,
to
take
care
o
'
Mother
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
pale
and
trembling
:
he
felt
there
was
some
terrible
secret
*NL*
under
all
this
.
``
Brother
,
''
he
said
,
faintly
--
he
never
called
Adam
*NL*
``
Brother
''
except
in
solemn
moments
--
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
'll
do
anything
*NL*
as
you
ca
n't
ask
God
's
blessing
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
lad
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
do
n't
be
afraid
.
I
'm
for
doing
nought
but
what
's
*NL*
a
man
's
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
that
if
he
betrayed
his
trouble
to
his
mother
,
she
would
*NL*
only
distress
him
by
words
,
half
of
blundering
affection
,
half
of
*NL*
irrepressible
triumph
that
Hetty
proved
as
unfit
to
be
his
wife
as
she
*NL*
had
always
foreseen
,
brought
back
some
of
his
habitual
firmness
and
*NL*
self-command
.
He
had
felt
ill
on
his
journey
home
--
he
told
her
when
she
*NL*
came
down
--
had
stayed
all
night
at
Tredddleston
for
that
reason
;
and
a
*NL*
bad
headache
,
that
still
hung
about
him
this
morning
,
accounted
for
his
*NL*
paleness
and
heavy
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
determined
to
go
to
the
village
,
in
the
first
place
,
attend
to
his
*NL*
business
for
an
hour
,
and
give
notice
to
Burge
of
his
being
obliged
to
*NL*
go
on
a
journey
,
which
he
must
beg
him
not
to
mention
to
any
one
;
for
*NL*
he
wished
to
avoid
going
to
the
Hall
Farm
near
breakfast-time
,
when
the
*NL*
children
and
servants
would
be
in
the
house-place
,
and
there
must
be
*NL*
exclamations
in
their
hearing
about
his
having
returned
without
Hetty
.
*NL*
He
waited
until
the
clock
struck
nine
before
he
left
the
work-yard
at
*NL*
the
village
,
and
set
off
,
through
the
fields
,
towards
the
Farm
.
It
was
*NL*
an
immense
relief
to
him
,
as
he
came
near
the
Home
Close
,
to
see
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
advancing
towards
him
,
for
this
would
spare
him
the
pain
of
going
*NL*
to
the
house
.
Mr.
Poyser
was
walking
briskly
this
March
morning
,
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
spring
business
on
his
mind
:
he
was
going
to
cast
the
master
's
*NL*
eye
on
the
shoeing
of
a
new
cart-horse
,
carrying
his
spud
as
a
useful
*NL*
companion
by
the
way
.
His
surprise
was
great
when
he
caught
sight
of
*NL*
Adam
,
but
he
was
not
a
man
given
to
presentiments
of
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Adam
,
lad
,
is
'
t
you
?
Have
ye
been
all
this
time
away
and
not
*NL*
brought
the
lasses
back
,
after
all
?
Where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
brought
'em
,
''
said
Adam
,
turning
round
,
to
indicate
that
*NL*
he
wished
to
walk
back
with
Mr.
Poyser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Martin
,
looking
with
sharper
attention
at
Adam
,
``
ye
look
*NL*
bad
.
Is
there
anything
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Adam
,
heavily
.
``
A
sad
thing
's
happened
.
I
didna
find
Hetty
*NL*
at
Snowfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
's
good-natured
face
showed
signs
of
troubled
astonishment
.
*NL*
``
Not
find
her
?
What
's
happened
to
her
?
''
he
said
,
his
thoughts
flying
at
*NL*
once
to
bodily
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
ca
n't
tell
,
whether
anything
's
happened
to
her
.
She
never
went
*NL*
to
Snowfield
--
she
took
the
coach
to
Stoniton
,
but
I
ca
n't
learn
nothing
*NL*
of
her
after
she
got
down
from
the
Stoniton
coach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
donna
mean
she
's
run
away
?
''
said
Martin
,
standing
still
,
so
*NL*
puzzled
and
bewildered
that
the
fact
did
not
yet
make
itself
felt
as
a
*NL*
trouble
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
ha
'
done
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
She
did
n't
like
our
marriage
when
it
*NL*
came
to
the
point
--
that
must
be
it
.
She
'd
mistook
her
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
looking
on
the
ground
and
rooting
*NL*
up
the
grass
with
his
spud
,
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
His
usual
*NL*
slowness
was
always
trebled
when
the
subject
of
speech
was
painful
.
At
*NL*
last
he
looked
up
,
right
in
Adam
's
face
,
saying
,
``
Then
she
didna
deserve
*NL*
t
'
ha
'
ye
,
my
lad
.
An
'
I
feel
i
'
fault
myself
,
for
she
was
my
niece
,
and
*NL*
I
was
allays
hot
for
her
marr

ing
ye
.
There
's
no
amends
I
can
make
ye

*NL*
lad
--
the
more
's
the
pity
:
it
's
a
sad
cut-up
for
ye
,
I
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
could
say
nothing
;
and
Mr.
Poyser
,
after
pursuing
his
walk
for
a
*NL*
little
while
,
went
on
,
``
I
'll
be
bound
she
's
gone
after
trying
to
get
a
*NL*
lady
's
maid
's
place
,
for
she
'd
got
that
in
her
head
half
a
year
ago
,
and
*NL*
wanted
me
to
gi
'
my
consent
.
But
I
'd
thought
better
on
her
''
--
he
added
,
*NL*
shaking
his
head
slowly
and
sadly
--
``
I
'd
thought
better
on
her
,
nor
to
*NL*
look
for
this
,
after
she

'
her
word
,
an
'
everything
been
got
*NL*
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
the
strongest
motives
for
encouraging
this
supposition
in
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
,
and
he
even
tried
to
believe
that
it
might
possibly
be
true
.
He
*NL*
had
no
warrant
for
the
certainty
that
she
was
gone
to
Arthur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
better
it
should
be
so
,
''
he
said
,
as
quietly
as
he
could
,
``
if
*NL*
she
felt
she
could
n't
like
me
for
a
husband

Better
run
away
before
than
*NL*
repent
after
.
I
hope
you
wo
n't
look
harshly
on
her
if
she
comes
back
,
as
*NL*
she
may
do
if
she
finds
it
hard
to
get
on
away
from
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
canna
look
on
her
as
I
've
done
before
,
''
said
Martin
decisively
.
*NL*
``
She
's
acted
bad
by
you

and
by
all

But
I
'll
not
turn
my
back

her
:
she
's

a

and
it
's
the
first
harm
I

*NL*
It
'll
be

*NL*
``

``

Mr.

indignantly
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
leave

*NL*
*NL*

said

,
``

Shake

I
wish
I
could
make

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
Martin
Poyser
's
throat
at
that
moment
which
*NL*
caused
him
to
bring
out
those
scanty
words
in
rather
a
broken
fashion
.
*NL*
Yet
Adam
knew
what
they
meant
all
the
better
,
and
the
two
honest
men
*NL*
grasped
each
other
's
hard
hands
in
mutual
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
now
to
hinder
Adam
from
setting
off
.
He
had
told
Seth
*NL*
to
go
to
the
Chase
and
leave
a
message
for
the
squire
,
saying
that
Adam
*NL*
Bede
had
been
obliged
to
start
off
suddenly
on
a
journey
--
and
to
say
as
*NL*
much
,
and
no
more
,
to
any
one
else
who
made
inquiries
about
him
.
If
the
*NL*
Poysers
learned
that
he
was
gone
away
again
,
Adam
knew
they
would
infer
*NL*
that
he
was
gone
in
search
of
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
intended
to
go
right
on
his
way
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
but
now
the
*NL*
impulse
which
had
frequently
visited
him
before
--
to
go
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
*NL*
and
make
a
confidant
of
him
--
recurred
with
the
new
force
which
belongs
*NL*
to
a
last
opportunity
.
He
was
about
to
start
on
a
long
journey
--
a
*NL*
difficult
one
--
by
sea
--
and
no
soul
would
know
where
he
was
gone
.
If
*NL*
anything
happened
to
him
?
Or
,
if
he
absolutely
needed
help
in
any
matter
*NL*
concerning
Hetty
?
Mr.
Irwine
was
to
be
trusted
;
and
the
feeling
which
*NL*
made
Adam
shrink
from
telling
anything
which
was
her
secret
must
give
*NL*
way
before
the
need
there
was
that
she
should
have
some
one
else
besides
*NL*
himself
who
would
be
prepared
to
defend
her
in
the
worst
extremity
.
*NL*
Towards
Arthur
,
even
though
he
might
have
incurred
no
new
guilt
,
Adam
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
not
bound
to
keep
silence
when
Hetty
's
interest
called
*NL*
on
him
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
do
it
,
''
said
Adam
,
when
these
thoughts
,
which
had
spread
*NL*
themselves
through
hours
of
his
sad
journeying
,
now
rushed
upon
him
in
*NL*
an
instant
,
like
a
wave
that
had
been
slowly
gathering
;
``
it
's
the
right
*NL*
thing
.
I
ca
n't
stand
alone
in
this
way
any
longer
.

The
Tidings
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ADAM
turned
his
face
towards
Broxton
and
walked
with
his
swiftest
*NL*
stride
,
looking
at
his
watch
with
the
fear
that
Mr.
Irwine
might
be
gone
*NL*
out
--
hunting
,
perhaps
.
The
fear
and
haste
together
produced
a
state
of
*NL*
strong
excitement
before
he
reached
the
rectory
gate
,
and
outside
it
he
*NL*
saw
the
deep
marks
of
a
recent
hoof
on
the
gravel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
hoofs
were
turned
towards
the
gate
,
not
away
from
it
,
and
though
*NL*
there
was
a
horse
against
the
stable
door
,
it
was
not
Mr.
Irwine
's
:
it
*NL*
had
evidently
had
a
journey
this
morning
,
and
must
belong
to
some
one
*NL*
who
had
come
on
business
.
Mr.
Irwine
was
at
home
,
then
;
but
Adam
could
*NL*
hardly
find
breath
and
calmness
to
tell
Carroll
that
he
wanted
to
speak
*NL*
to
the
rector
.
The
double
suffering
of
certain
and
uncertain
sorrow
had
*NL*
begun
to
shake
the
strong
man
.
The
butler
looked
at
him
wonderingly
,
as
*NL*
he
threw
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
passage
and
stared
absently
at
the
*NL*
clock
on
the
opposite
wall
.
The
master
had
somebody
with
him
,
he
said
,
*NL*
but
he
heard
the
study
door
open
--
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
coming
out
,
*NL*
and
as
Adam
was
in
a
hurry
,
he
would
let
the
master
know
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
sat
looking
at
the
clock
:
the
minute-hand
was
hurrying
along
the
*NL*
last
five
minutes
to
ten
with
a
loud
,
hard
,
indifferent
tick
,
and
Adam
*NL*
watched
the
movement
and
listened
to
the
sound
as
if
he
had
had
some
*NL*
reason
for
doing
so
.
In
our
times
of
bitter
suffering
there
are
almost
*NL*
always
these
pauses
,
when
our
consciousness
is
benumbed
to
everything
*NL*
but
some
trivial
perception
or
sensation
.
It
is
as
if
semi-idiocy
came
*NL*
to
give
us
rest
from
the
memory
and
the
dread
which
refuse
to
leave
us
*NL*
in
our
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carroll
,
coming
back
,
recalled
Adam
to
the
sense
of
his
burden
.
He
*NL*
was
to
go
into
the
study
immediately
.
``
I
ca
n't
think
what
that
strange
*NL*
person
's
come
about
,
''
the
butler
added
,
from
mere
incontinence
of
*NL*
remark
,
as
he
preceded
Adam
to
the
door
,
``
he
's
gone
i
'
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
And
master
looks
unaccountable
--
as
if
he
was
frightened
.
''
Adam
took
no
*NL*
notice
of
the
words
:
he
could
not
care
about
other
people
's
business
.
*NL*
But
when
he
entered
the
study
and
looked
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
,
he
felt
*NL*
in
an
instant
that
there
was
a
new
expression
in
it
,
strangely
different
*NL*
from
the
warm
friendliness
it
had
always
worn
for
him
before
.
A
letter
*NL*
lay
open
on
the
table
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
's
hand
was
on
it
,
but
the
changed
*NL*
glance
he
cast
on
Adam
could
not
be
owing
entirely
to
preoccupation
with
*NL*
some
disagreeable
business
,
for
he
was
looking
eagerly
towards
the
door
,
*NL*
as
if
Adam
's
entrance
were
a
matter
of
poignant
anxiety
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
speak
to
me
,
Adam
,
''
he
said
,
in
that
low
constrainedly
*NL*
quiet
tone
which
a
man
uses
when
he
is
determined
to
suppress
agitation
.
*NL*
``
Sit
down
here
.
''
He
pointed
to
a
chair
just
opposite
to
him
,
at
no
more
*NL*
than
a
yard
's
distance
from
his
own
,
and
Adam
sat
down
with
a
sense
*NL*
that
this
cold
manner
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
gave
an
additional
unexpected
*NL*
difficulty
to
his
disclosure
.
But
when
Adam
had
made
up
his
mind
to
*NL*
a
measure
,
he
was
not
the
man
to
renounce
it
for
any
but
imperative
*NL*
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
to
you
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
as
the
gentleman
I
look
up
to
most
of
*NL*
anybody
.
I
've
something
very
painful
to
tell
you
--
something
as
it
'll
*NL*
pain
you
to
hear
as
well
as
me
to
tell
.
But
if
I
speak
o
'
the
wrong
*NL*
other
people
have
done
,
you
'll
see
I
did
n't
speak
till
I
'd
good
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
nodded
slowly
,
and
Adam
went
on
rather
tremulously
,
``
You
was
*NL*
t
'
ha
'
married
me
and
Hetty
Sorrel
,
you
know
,
sir
,
o
'
the
fifteenth
o
'
*NL*
this
month
.
I
thought
she
loved
me
,
and
I
was
th
'
happiest
man
i
'
the
*NL*
parish
.
But
a
dreadful
blow
's
come
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
started
up
from
his
chair
,
as
if
involuntarily
,
but
then
,
*NL*
determined
to
control
himself
,
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
gone
away
,
sir
,
and
we
do
n't
know
where
.
She
said
she
was
going
*NL*
to
Snowfield
o
'
Friday
was
a
fortnight
,
and
I
went
last
Sunday
to
*NL*
fetch
her
back
;
but
she
'd
never
been
there
,
and
she
took
the
coach
to
*NL*
Stoniton
,
and
beyond
that
I
ca
n't
trace
her
.
But
now
I
'm
going
a
long
*NL*
journey
to
look
for
her
,
and
I
ca
n't
trust
t
'
anybody
but
you
where
I
'm
*NL*
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
came
back
from
the
window
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
no
idea
of
the
reason
why
she
went
away
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
plain
enough
she
did
n't
want
to
marry
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
She
*NL*
did
n't
like
it
when
it
came
so
near
.
But
that
is
n't
all
,
I
doubt
.
*NL*
There
's
something
else
I
must
tell
you
,
sir
.
There
's
somebody
else
*NL*
concerned
besides
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gleam
of
something
--
it
was
almost
like
relief
or
joy
--
came
across
the
*NL*
eager
anxiety
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
at
that
moment
.
Adam
was
looking
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
paused
a
little
:
the
next
words
were
hard
to
speak
.
*NL*
But
when
he
went
on
,
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
looked
straight
at
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
.
He
would
do
the
thing
he
had
resolved
to
do
,
without
flinching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
's
the
man
I
've
reckoned
my
greatest
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
*NL*
used
to
be
proud
to
think
as
I
should
pass
my
life
i
'
working
for
him
,
*NL*
and
had
felt
so
ever
since
we
were
lads
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
if
all
self-control
had
forsaken
him
,
grasped
Adam
's
arm
,
*NL*
which
lay
on
the
table
,
and
,
clutching
it
tightly
like
a
man
in
pain
,
*NL*
said
,
with
pale
lips
and
a
low
hurried
voice
,
``
No
,
Adam
,
no
--
do
n't
say
*NL*
it
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
,
surprised
at
the
violence
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
feeling
,
repented
of
the
*NL*
words
that
had
passed
his
lips
and
sat
in
distressed
silence
.
The
grasp
*NL*
on
his
arm
gradually
relaxed
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
threw
himself
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
,
saying
,
``
Go
on
--
I
must
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
played
with
Hetty
's
feelings
,
and
behaved
to
her
as
he
'd
no
*NL*
right
to
do
to
a
girl
in
her
station
o
'
life
--
made
her
presents
and
used
*NL*
to
go
and
meet
her
out
a-walking
.
I
found
it
out
only
two
days
before
*NL*
he
went
away
--
found
him
a-kissing
her
as
they
were
parting
in
the
Grove
.
*NL*
There
'd
been
nothing
said
between
me
and
Hetty
then
,
though
I
'd
loved
*NL*
her
for
a
long
while
,
and
she
knew
it
.
But
I
reproached
him
with
his
*NL*
wrong
actions
,
and
words
and
blows
passed
between
us
;
and
he
said
*NL*
solemnly
to
me
,
after
that
,
as
it
had
been
all
nonsense
and
no
more
*NL*
than
a
bit
o
'
flirting
.
But
I
made
him
write
a
letter
to
tell
Hetty
*NL*
he
'd
meant
nothing
,
for
I
saw
clear
enough
,
sir
,
by
several
things
as
*NL*
I
had
n't
understood
at
the
time
,
as
he
'd
got
hold
of
her
heart
,
and
*NL*
I
thought
she
'd
belike
go
on
thinking
of
him
and
never
come
to
love
*NL*
another
man
as
wanted
to
marry
her
.
And
I
gave
her
the
letter
,
and
she
*NL*
seemed
to
bear
it
all
after
a
while
better
than
I
'd
expected
...
and
she
*NL*
behaved
kinder
and
kinder
to
me
...
I
daresay
she
did
n't
know
her
own
*NL*
feelings
then
,
poor
thing
,
and
they
came
back
upon
her
when
it
was
too
*NL*
late
...
I
do
n't
want
to
blame
her
...
I
ca
n't
think
as
she
meant
to
deceive
*NL*
me
.
But
I
was
encouraged
to
think
she
loved
me
,
and
--
you
know
the
rest
,
*NL*
sir
.
But
it
's
on
my
mind
as
he
's
been
false
to
me
,
and
`
ticed
her
away
,
*NL*
and
she
's
gone
to
him
--
and
I
'm
going
now
to
see
,
for
I
can
never
go
to
*NL*
work
again
till
I
know
what
's
become
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
Adam
's
narrative
,
Mr.
Irwine
had
had
time
to
recover
his
*NL*
self-mastery
in
spite
of
the
painful
thoughts
that
crowded
upon
him
.
*NL*
It
was
a
bitter
remembrance
to
him
now
--
that
morning
when
Arthur
*NL*
breakfasted
with
him
and
seemed
as
if
he
were
on
the
verge
of
a
*NL*
confession
.
It
was
plain
enough
now
what
he
had
wanted
to
confess
.
And
*NL*
if
their
words
had
taken
another
turn
...
if
he
himself
had
been
less
*NL*
fastidious
about
intruding
on
another
man
's
secrets
...
it
was
cruel
*NL*
to
think
how
thin
a
film
had
shut
out
rescue
from
all
this
guilt
and
*NL*
misery
.
He
saw
the
whole
history
now
by
that
terrible
illumination
which
*NL*
the
present
sheds
back
upon
the
past
.
But
every
other
feeling
as
it
*NL*
rushed
upon
his
was
thrown
into
abeyance
by
pity
,
deep
respectful
pity
,
*NL*
for
the
man
who
sat
before
him
--
already
so
bruised
,
going
forth
with
sad
*NL*
blind
resignedness
to
an
unreal
sorrow
,
while
a
real
one
was
close
*NL*
upon
him
,
too
far
beyond
the
range
of
common
trial
for
him
ever
to
have
*NL*
feared
it
.
His
own
agitation
was
quelled
by
a
certain
awe
that
comes
*NL*
over
us
in
the
presence
of
a
great
anguish
,
for
the
anguish
he
must
*NL*
inflict
on
Adam
was
already
present
to
him
.
Again
he
put
his
hand
on
*NL*
the
arm
that
lay
on
the
table
,
but
very
gently
this
time
,
as
he
said
*NL*
solemnly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
my
dear
friend
,
you
have
had
some
hard
trials
in
your
life
.
You
*NL*
can
bear
sorrow
manfully
,
as
well
as
act
manfully
.
God
requires
both
*NL*
tasks
at
our
hands
.
And
there
is
a
heavier
sorrow
coming
upon
you
than
*NL*
any
you
have
yet
known
.
But
you
are
not
guilty
--
you
have
not
the
worst
*NL*
of
all
sorrows
.
God
help
him
who
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
pale
faces
looked
at
each
other
;
in
Adam
's
there
was
trembling
*NL*
suspense
,
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
hesitating
,
shrinking
pity
.
But
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
news
of
Hetty
this
morning
.
She
is
not
gone
to
him
.
She
is
*NL*
in
Stonyshire
--
at
Stoniton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
started
up
from
his
chair
,
as
if
he
thought
he
could
have
leaped
*NL*
to
her
that
moment
.
But
Mr.
Irwine
laid
hold
of
his
arm
again
and
said
,
*NL*
persuasively
,
``
Wait
,
Adam
,
wait
.
''
So
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
in
a
very
unhappy
position
--
one
which
will
make
it
worse
for
you
*NL*
to
find
her
,
my
poor
friend
,
than
to
have
lost
her
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
's
lips
moved
tremulously
,
but
no
sound
came
.
They
moved
again
,
and
*NL*
he
whispered
,
``
Tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
been
arrested
...
she
is
in
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
an
insulting
blow
had
brought
back
the
spirit
of
resistance
*NL*
into
Adam
.
The
blood
rushed
to
his
face
,
and
he
said
,
loudly
and
*NL*
sharply
,
``
For
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
a
great
crime
--
the
murder
of
her
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
CA
N'T
BE
!
''
Adam
almost
shouted
,
starting
up
from
his
chair
and
*NL*
making
a
stride
towards
the
door
;
but
he
turned
round
again
,
setting
his
*NL*
back
against
the
bookcase
,
and
looking
fiercely
at
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
It
is
n't
*NL*
possible
.
She
never
had
a
child
.
She
ca
n't
be
guilty
.
WHO
says
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
grant
she
may
be
innocent
,
Adam
.
We
can
still
hope
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
says
she
is
guilty
?
''
said
Adam
violently
.
``
Tell
me
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
letter
from
the
magistrate
before
whom
she
was
taken
,
and
the
*NL*
constable
who
arrested
her
is
in
the
dining-room
.
She
will
not
confess
*NL*
her
name
or
where
she
comes
from
;
but
I
fear
,
I
fear
,
there
can
be
no
*NL*
doubt
it
is
Hetty
.
The
description
of
her
person
corresponds
,
only
*NL*
that
she
is
said
to
look
very
pale
and
ill
.
She
had
a
small
red-leather
*NL*
pocket-book
in
her
pocket
with
two
names
written
in
it
--
one
at
the
*NL*
beginning
,
`
Hetty
Sorrel
,
Hayslope
,

and
the
other
near
the
end
,
`
Dinah
*NL*
Morris
,
Snowfield

She
will
not
say
which
is
her
own
name

she
denies
*NL*
everything

and
will
answer
no
questions
,
and
application
has
been
made
*NL*
to
me
,
as
a
magistrate
,
that
I
may
take
measures
for
identifying
her
,
*NL*
for
it
was
thought
probable
that
the
name
which
stands
first
is
her
own
*NL*
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
proof
have
they
got
against
her
,
if
it
IS
Hetty
?
''
said
Adam
,
*NL*
still
violently
,
with
an
effort
that
seemed
to
shake
his
whole
frame
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
believe
it
.
It
could
n't
ha

been
,
and
none
of
us
know
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Terrible
proof
that
she
was
under
the
temptation
to
commit
the
crime
;
*NL*
but
we
have
room
to
hope
that
she
did
not
really
commit
it
.
Try
and
read
*NL*
that
letter
,
Adam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
took
the
letter
between
his
shaking
hands
and
tried
to
fix
his
eyes
*NL*
steadily
on
it
.
Mr.
Irwine
meanwhile
went
out
to
give
some
orders
.
When
*NL*
he
came
back
,
Adam
's
eyes
were
still
on
the
first
page
--
he
could
n't
*NL*
read
--
he
could
not
put
the
words
together
and
make
out
what
they
meant
.
*NL*
He
threw
it
down
at
last
and
clenched
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
HIS
doing
,
''
he
said
;
``
if
there
's
been
any
crime
,
it
's
at
his
door
,
*NL*
not
at
hers
.
HE
taught
her
to
deceive
--
HE
deceived
me
first
.
Let
'em
put
*NL*
HIM
on
his
trial
--
let
him
stand
in
court
beside
her
,
and
I
'll
tell
'em
*NL*
how
he
got
hold
of
her
heart
,
and
`
ticed
her
t

evil
,
and
then
lied
to
*NL*
me
.
Is
HE
to
go
free
,
while
they
lay
all
the
punishment
on
her
...
so
weak
*NL*
and
young
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
image
called
up
by
these
last
words
gave
a
new
direction
to
poor
*NL*
Adam
's
maddened
feelings
.
He
was
silent
,
looking
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
as
if
he
saw
something
there
.
Then
he
burst
out
again
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
appealing
anguish
,
``
I
ca
n't
bear
it
...
O
God
,
it
's
too
hard
to
lay
upon
*NL*
me
--
it
's
too
hard
to
think
she
's
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
had
sat
down
again
in
silence
.
He
was
too
wise
to
utter
*NL*
soothing
words
at
present
,
and
indeed
,
the
sight
of
Adam
before
him
,
*NL*
with
that
look
of
sudden
age
which
sometimes
comes
over
a
young
face
in
*NL*
moments
of
terrible
emotion
--
the
hard
bloodless
look
of
the
skin
,
the
*NL*
deep
lines
about
the
quivering
mouth
,
the
furrows
in
the
brow
--
the
sight
*NL*
of
this
strong
firm
man
shattered
by
the
invisible
stroke
of
sorrow
,
*NL*
moved
him
so
deeply
that
speech
was
not
easy
.
Adam
stood
motionless
,
*NL*
with
his
eyes
vacantly
fixed
in
this
way
for
a
minute
or
two
;
in
that
*NL*
short
space
he
was
living
through
all
his
love
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
ha
'
done
it
,
''
he
said
,
still
without
moving
his
eyes
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
only
talking
to
himself
:
``
it
was
fear
made
her
hide
it
...
I
*NL*
forgive
her
for
deceiving
me
...
I
forgive
thee
,
Hetty
...
thee
wast
*NL*
deceived
too
...
it
's
gone
hard
wi
'
thee
,
my
poor
Hetty
...
but
they
'll
*NL*
never
make
me
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
again
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
he
said
,
with
fierce
*NL*
abruptness
,
``
I
'll
go
to
him
--
I
'll
bring
him
back
--
I
'll
make
him
go
and
*NL*
look
at
her
in
her
misery
--
he
shall
look
at
her
till
he
ca
n't
forget
*NL*
it
--
it
shall
follow
him
night
and
day
--
as
long
as
he
lives
it
shall
*NL*
follow
him
--
he
sha
n't
escape
wi
'
lies
this
time
--
I
'll
fetch
him
,
I
'll
*NL*
drag
him
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
act
of
going
towards
the
door
,
Adam
paused
automatically
and
*NL*
looked
about
for
his
hat
,
quite
unconscious
where
he
was
or
who
was
*NL*
present
with
him
.
Mr.
Irwine
had
followed
him
,
and
now
took
him
by
the
*NL*
arm
,
saying
,
in
a
quiet
but
decided
tone
,
``
No
,
Adam
,
no
;
I
'm
sure
you
*NL*
will
wish
to
stay
and
see
what
good
can
be
done
for
her
,
instead
of
*NL*
going
on
a
useless
errand
of
vengeance
.
The
punishment
will
surely
fall
*NL*
without
your
aid
.
Besides
,
he
is
no
longer
in
Ireland
.
He
must
be
on
his
*NL*
way
home
--
or
would
be
,
long
before
you
arrived
,
for
his
grandfather
,
I
*NL*
know
,
wrote
for
him
to
come
at
least
ten
days
ago
.
I
want
you
now
to
go
*NL*
with
me
to
Stoniton
.
I
have
ordered
a
horse
for
you
to
ride
with
us
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
you
can
compose
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mr.
Irwine
was
speaking
,
Adam
recovered
his
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
actual
scene
.
He
rubbed
his
hair
off
his
forehead
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
''
Mr.
Irwine
went
on
,
``
there
are
others
to
think
of
,
and
*NL*
act
for
,
besides
yourself
,
Adam
:
there
are
Hetty
's
friends
,
the
good
*NL*
Poysers
,
on
whom
this
stroke
will
fall
more
heavily
than
I
can
bear
to
*NL*
think
.
I
expect
it
from
your
strength
of
mind
,
Adam
--
from
your
sense
of
*NL*
duty
to
God
and
man
--
that
you
will
try
to
act
as
long
as
action
can
be
*NL*
of
any
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
Mr.
Irwine
proposed
this
journey
to
Stoniton
for
Adam
's
*NL*
own
sake
.
Movement
,
with
some
object
before
him
,
was
the
best
means
of
*NL*
counteracting
the
violence
of
suffering
in
these
first
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
with
me
to
Stoniton
,
Adam
?
''
he
said
again
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
.
``
We
have
to
see
if
it
is
really
Hetty
who
is
there
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
I
'll
do
what
you
think
right
.
But
the
folks
at
*NL*
th
'
Hall
Farm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
them
not
to
know
till
I
return
to
tell
them
myself
.
I
shall
*NL*
have
ascertained
things
then
which
I
am
uncertain
about
now
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
return
as
soon
as
possible
.
Come
now

the
horses
are
ready

*NL*
MR.
IRWINE
returned
from
Stoniton
in
a
post-chaise
that
night
,
and
the
*NL*
first
words
Carroll
said
to
him
,
as
he
entered
the
house
,
were
,
that
*NL*
Squire
Donnithorne
was
dead
--
found
dead
in
his
bed
at
ten
o'clock
that
*NL*
morning
--
and
that
Mrs.
Irwine
desired
him
to
say
she
should
be
awake
*NL*
when
Mr.
Irwine
came
home
,
and
she
begged
him
not
to
go
to
bed
without
*NL*
seeing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Dauphin
,
''
Mrs.
Irwine
said
,
as
her
son
entered
her
room
,
``
you
're
*NL*
come
at
last
.
So
the
old
gentleman
's
fidgetiness
and
low
spirits
,
which
*NL*
made
him
send
for
Arthur
in
that
sudden
way
,
really
meant
something
.
I
*NL*
suppose
Carroll
has
told
you
that
Donnithorne
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
*NL*
this
morning
.
You
will
believe
my
prognostications
another
time
,
though
*NL*
I
daresay
I
sha
n't
live
to
prognosticate
anything
but
my
own
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
they
done
about
Arthur
?
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
Sent
a
messenger
*NL*
to
await
him
at
Liverpool
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Ralph
was
gone
before
the
news
was
brought
to
us
.
Dear
Arthur
,
I
*NL*
shall
live
now
to
see
him
master
at
the
Chase
,
and
making
good
times
on
*NL*
the
estate
,
like
a
generous-hearted
fellow
as
he
is
.
He
'll
be
as
happy
*NL*
as
a
king
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
could
not
help
giving
a
slight
groan
:
he
was
worn
with
*NL*
anxiety
and
exertion
,
and
his
mother
's
light
words
were
almost
*NL*
intolerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
so
dismal
about
,
Dauphin
?
Is
there
any
bad
news
?
Or
are
*NL*
you
thinking
of
the
danger
for
Arthur
in
crossing
that
frightful
Irish
*NL*
Channel
at
this
time
of
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mother
,
I
'm
not
thinking
of
that
;
but
I
'm
not
prepared
to
rejoice
*NL*
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
worried
by
this
law
business
that
you
've
been
to

*NL*
about

What
in

world
is
it
,
that
you
ca
n't
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
know
by
and
by

It
would
not
be
right
for
me
to

you
at
present
.
Good-night
:
you
'll
sleep
now
you
have
no
longer
anything
*NL*
to
listen
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
gave
up
his
intention
of
sending
a
letter
to
meet
Arthur
,
*NL*
since
it
would
not
now
hasten
his
return
:
the
news
of
his
grandfather
's
*NL*
death
would
bring
him
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
come
.
He
could
go
*NL*
to
bed
now
and
get
some
needful
rest
,
before
the
time
came
for
the
*NL*
morning
's
heavy
duty
of
carrying
his
sickening
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
*NL*
to
Adam
's
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
himself
was
not
come
back
from
Stoniton
,
for
though
he
shrank
from
*NL*
seeing
Hetty
,
he
could
not
bear
to
go
to
a
distance
from
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
,
sir
,
''
he
said
to
the
rector
,
``
it
's
no
use
for
me
to
go
*NL*
back
.
I
ca
n't
go
to
work
again
while
she
's
here
,
and
I
could
n't
bear
*NL*
the
sight
o
'
the
things
and
folks
round
home
.
I
'll
take
a
bit
of
a
room
*NL*
here
,
where
I
can
see
the
prison
walls
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
get
,
in
*NL*
time
,
to
bear
seeing
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
not
been
shaken
in
his
belief
that
Hetty
was
innocent
of
the
*NL*
crime
she
was
charged
with
,
for
Mr.
Irwine
,
feeling
that
the
belief
in
*NL*
her
guilt
would
be
a
crushing
addition
to
Adam
's
load
,
had
kept
from
him
*NL*
the
facts
which
left
no
hope
in
his
own
mind
.
There
was
not
any
reason
*NL*
for
thrusting
the
whole
burden
on
Adam
at
once
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
,
at
*NL*
parting
,
only
said
,
``
If
the
evidence
should
tell
too
strongly
against
*NL*
her
,
Adam
,
we
may
still
hope
for
a
pardon
.
Her
youth
and
other
*NL*
circumstances
will
be
a
plea
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
and
it
's
right
people
should
know
how
she
was
tempted
into
the
*NL*
wrong
way
,
''
said
Adam
,
with
bitter
earnestness
.
``
It
's
right
they
should
*NL*
know
it
was
a
fine
gentleman
made
love
to
her
,
and
turned
her
head
wi
'
*NL*
notions
.
You
'll
remember
,
sir
,
you
've
promised
to
tell
my
mother
,
and
*NL*
Seth
,
and
the
people
at
the
farm
,
who
it
was
as
led
her
wrong
,
else
*NL*
they
'll
think
harder
of
her
than
she
deserves
.
You
'll
be
doing
her
a
*NL*
hurt
by
sparing
him
,
and
I
hold
him
the
guiltiest
before
God
,
let
her
*NL*
ha
'
done
what
she
may
.
If
you
spare
him
,
I
'll
expose
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
your
demand
is
just
,
Adam
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
``
but
when
you
are
*NL*
calmer
,
you
will
judge
Arthur
more
mercifully
.
I
say
nothing
now
,
only
*NL*
that
his
punishment
is
in
other
hands
than
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
felt
it
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
have
to
tell
of
Arthur
's
*NL*
sad
part
in
the
story
of
sin
and
sorrow
--
he
who
cared
for
Arthur
with
*NL*
fatherly
affection
,
who
had
cared
for
him
with
fatherly
pride
.
But
he
*NL*
saw
clearly
that
the
secret
must
be
known
before
long
,
even
apart
from
*NL*
Adam
's
determination
,
since
it
was
scarcely
to
be
supposed
that
Hetty
*NL*
would
persist
to
the
end
in
her
obstinate
silence
.
He
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
withhold
nothing
from
the
Poysers
,
but
to
tell
them
the
worst
at
*NL*
once
,
for
there
was
no
time
to
rob
the
tidings
of
their
suddenness
.
*NL*
Hetty
's
trial
must
come
on
at
the
Lent
assizes
,
and
they
were
to
be
*NL*
held
at
Stoniton
the
next
week
.
It
was
scarcely
to
be
hoped
that
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
could
escape
the
pain
of
being
called
as
a
witness
,
and
it
was
*NL*
better
he
should
know
everything
as
long
beforehand
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
ten
o'clock
on
Thursday
morning
the
home
at
the
Hall
Farm
was
*NL*
a
house
of
mourning
for
a
misfortune
felt
to
be
worse
than
death
.
The
*NL*
sense
of
family
dishonour
was
too
keen
even
in
the
kind-hearted
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
the
younger
to
leave
room
for
any
compassion
towards
Hetty
.
He
*NL*
and
his
father
were
simple-minded
farmers
,
proud
of
their
untarnished
*NL*
character
,
proud
that
they
came
of
a
family
which
had
held
up
its
head
*NL*
and
paid
its
way
as
far
back
as
its
name
was
in
the
parish
register
;
*NL*
and
Hetty
had
brought
disgrace
on
them
all
--
disgrace
that
could
never
*NL*
be
wiped
out
.
That
was
the
all-conquering
feeling
in
the
mind
both
of
*NL*
father
and
son
--
the
scorching
sense
of
disgrace
,
which
neutralised
all
*NL*
other
sensibility
--
and
Mr.
Irwine
was
struck
with
surprise
to
observe
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Poyser
was
less
severe
than
her
husband
.
We
are
often
startled
*NL*
by
the
severity
of
mild
people
on
exceptional
occasions
;
the
reason
is
,
*NL*
that
mild
people
are
most
liable
to
be
under
the
yoke
of
traditional
*NL*
impressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
to
pay
any
money
as
is
wanted
towards
trying
to
bring
her
*NL*
off
,
''
said
Martin
the
younger
when
Mr.
Irwine
was
gone
,
while
the
old
*NL*
grandfather
was
crying
in
the
opposite
chair
,
``
but
I
'll
not
go
nigh
her
,
*NL*
nor
ever
see
her
again
,
by
my
own
will
.
She
's
made
our
bread
bitter
to
*NL*
us
for
all
our
lives
to
come
,
an
'
we
shall
ne'er
hold
up
our
heads

*NL*
this
parish
nor
i
'
any
other

The
parson
talks
o

folks
pitying
us

*NL*
poor
amends
pity

ull

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
?
''
said
the
grandfather
,
sharply
.
``
I
ne'er
wanted
folks
's
pity

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
fret
so
,
father
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
spoken
very
little
,
*NL*
being
almost
overawed
by
her
husband
's
unusual
hardness
and
decision
.
*NL*
``

slowly
down

Before

arrived
with

had

already
flown

his

sobbed
and
rocked
herself
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch

''
said
Lisbeth
,
looking
up
and
pausing
from
her
grief
,
like
*NL*
a
crying
child
who
hears
some
promise
of
consolation
.
``
Why

what

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alick
came
now
with
the
message
,
and
Seth
,
finding
that
Mrs.
Poyser
was
*NL*
writing
to
Dinah
,
gave
up
the
intention
of
writing
himself
;
but
he
went
*NL*
to
the
Hall
Farm
to
tell
them
all
he
could
suggest
about
the
address
*NL*
of
the
letter
,
and
warn
them
that
there
might
be
some
delay
in
the
*NL*
delivery
,
from
his
not
knowing
an
exact
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
Lisbeth
,
Mr.
Irwine
had
gone
to
Jonathan
Burge
,
who
had
also
*NL*
a
claim
to
be
acquainted
with
what
was
likely
to
keep
Adam
away
from
*NL*
business
for
some
time
;
and
before
six
o'clock
that
evening
there
were
*NL*
few
people
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
who
had
not
heard
the
sad
news
.
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
had
not
mentioned
Arthur
's
name
to
Burge
,
and
yet
the
story
of
*NL*
his
conduct
towards
Hetty
,
with
all
the
dark
shadows
cast
upon
it
by
*NL*
its
terrible
consequences
,
was
presently
as
well
known
as
that
his
*NL*
grandfather
was
dead
,
and
that
he
was
come
into
the
estate
.
For
Martin
*NL*
Poyser
felt
no
motive
to
keep
silence
towards
the
one
or
two
neighbours
*NL*
who
ventured
to
come
and
shake
him
sorrowfully
by
the
hand
on
the
first
*NL*
day
of
his
trouble
;
and
Carroll
,
who
kept
his
ears
open
to
all
that
*NL*
passed
at
the
rectory
,
had
framed
an
inferential
version
of
the
story
,
*NL*
and
found
early
opportunities
of
communicating
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
neighbours
who
came
to
Martin
Poyser
and
shook
him
by
the
*NL*
hand
without
speaking
for
some
minutes
was
Bartle
Massey
.
He
had
shut
*NL*
up
his
school
,
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
rectory
,
where
he
arrived
about
*NL*
half-past
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
,
sending
his
duty
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
*NL*
begged
pardon
for
troubling
him
at
that
hour
,
but
had
something
*NL*
particular
on
his
mind
.
He
was
shown
into
the
study
,
where
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
soon
joined
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Bartle
?
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
putting
out
his
hand
.
That
was
not
his
*NL*
usual
way
of
saluting
the
schoolmaster
,
but
trouble
makes
us
treat
all
*NL*
who
feel
with
us
very
much
alike
.
``
Sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
I
'm

about

well
as
I
do

said
*NL*
Bartle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

about
Hetty
Sorrel

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
what
I
wish
to
know
is
about
Adam
Bede
.
I
understand
you
left
*NL*
him
at
Stoniton
,
and
I
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
tell
me
what
's
the
state
*NL*
of
the
poor
lad
's
mind
,
and
what
he
means
to
do
.
For
as
for
that
bit
o
'
*NL*
pink-and-white
they
've
taken
the
trouble
to
put
in
jail
,
I
do
n't
value
*NL*
her
a
rotten
nut
--
not
a
rotten
nut
--
only
for
the
harm
or
good
that
may
*NL*
come
out
of
her
to
an
honest
man

a
lad
I
've
set
such
store
*NL*
by

trusted
to
,
that
he
'd
make
my
bit
o

knowledge
go
a
good
way
in
the
*NL*
world

Why
,
sir
,
he
's
the
only
scholar
I
've
had
in
this
stupid
country
*NL*
that
ever
had
the
will
or
the
head-piece
for
mathematics
.
If
he
had
n't
*NL*
had
so
much
hard
work
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
he
might
have
gone
into
the
*NL*
higher
branches
,
and
then
this
might
never
have
happened
--
might
never
*NL*
have
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
was
heated
by
the
exertion
of
walking
fast
in
an
agitated
frame
*NL*
of
mind
,
and
was
not
able
to
check
himself
on
this
first
occasion
of
*NL*
venting
his
feelings
.
But
he
paused
now
to
rub
his
moist
forehead
,
and
*NL*
probably
his
moist
eyes
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
when
this
pause
had
given
him
time
to
*NL*
reflect
,
``
for
running
on
in
this
way
about
my
own
feelings
,
like
that
*NL*
foolish
dog
of
mine
howling
in
a
storm
,
when
there
's
nobody
wants
to
*NL*
listen
to
me
.
I
came
to
hear
you
speak
,
not
to
talk
myself
--
if
you
'll
*NL*
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
what
the
poor
lad
's
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
yourself
under
any
restraint
,
Bartle
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
The
*NL*
fact
is
,
I
'm
very
much
in
the
same
condition
as
you
just
now
;
I
've
a
*NL*
great
deal
that
's
painful
on
my
mind
,
and
I
find
it
hard
work
to
be
*NL*
quite
silent
about
my
own
feelings
and
only
attend
to
others
.
I
share
*NL*
your
concern
for
Adam
,
though
he
is
not
the
only
one
whose
sufferings
I
*NL*
care
for
in
this
affair
.
He
intends
to
remain
at
Stoniton
till
after
the
*NL*
trial
:
it
will
come
on
probably
a
week
to-morrow
.
He
has
taken
a
room
*NL*
there
,
and
I
encouraged
him
to
do
so
,
because
I
think
it
better
he
*NL*
should
be
away
from
his
own
home
at
present
;
and
,
poor
fellow
,
he
still
*NL*
believes
Hetty
is
innocent
--
he
wants
to
summon
up
courage
to
see
her
if
*NL*
he
can
;
he
is
unwilling
to
leave
the
spot
where
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
creatur
's
guilty

then
?

said
Bartle
.
``
Do
you
think
*NL*
they
'll
hang
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
her
.
The
evidence
is
very
strong
.
And
*NL*
one
bad
symptom
is
that
she
denies
everything
--
denies
that
she
has
had
*NL*
a
child
in
the
face
of
the
most
positive
evidence
.
I
saw
her
myself
,
and
*NL*
she
was
obstinately
silent
to
me
;
she
shrank
up
like
a
frightened
animal
*NL*
when
she
saw
me
.
I
was
never
so
shocked
in
my
life
as
at
the
change
in
*NL*
her
.
But
I
trust
that
,
in
the
worst
case
,
we
may
obtain
a
pardon
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
the
innocent
who
are
involved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
''
said
Bartle
,
forgetting
in
his
irritation
to
whom
*NL*
he
was
speaking
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
mean
it
's
stuff
and
nonsense
*NL*
for
the
innocent
to
care
about
her
being
hanged
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
*NL*
think
the
sooner
such
women
are
put
out
o

the
world
the
better
;
and
the
*NL*
men
that
help
'em
to
do
mischief
had
better
go
along
with
'em
for
that
*NL*
matter
.
What
good
will
you
do
by
keeping
such
vermin
alive
,
eating
the
*NL*
victual
that
`
ud
feed
rational
beings
?
But
if
Adam
's
fool
enough
to
care
*NL*
about
it
,
I
do
n't
want
him
to
suffer
more
than
's
needful
...
Is
he
very
*NL*
much
cut
up

poor
fellow

Bartle
added
,
taking
out
his
spectacles
and
*NL*
putting
them
on
,
as
if
they
would
assist
his
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

afraid

grief
cuts
very
deep

said
Mr.

He
looks

terribly
shattered

made
me
wish

could
have
remained
near

But
I

shall
go
to
Stoniton
again
to-morrow

I
have
confidence

the
strength

endure

Irwine
,
who
was
involuntarily
uttering
his
own
thoughts
rather
*NL*
than
addressing
Bartle
Massey
in
the
last
sentence
,
had
in
his
mind
the
*NL*
possibility
that
the
spirit
of
vengeance
to-wards
Arthur
,
which
was
*NL*
the
form
Adam
's
anguish
was
continually
taking
,
might
make
him
seek
an
*NL*
encounter
that
was
likely
to
end
more
fatally
than
the
one
in
the
Grove
.
*NL*
This
possibility
heightened
the
anxiety
with
which
he
looked
forward
*NL*
to
Arthur
's
arrival
.
But
Bartle
thought
Mr.
Irwine
was
referring
to
*NL*
suicide
,
and
his
face
wore
a
new
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
have
in
my
head
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
hope
you
'll
*NL*
approve
of
it
.
I
'm
going
to
shut
up
my
school
--
if
the
scholars
come
,
*NL*
they
must
go
back
again
,
that
's
all
--
and
I
shall
go
to
Stoniton
and
look
*NL*
after
Adam
till
this
business
is
over
.
I
'll
pretend
I
'm
come
to
look
*NL*
on
at
the
assizes
;
he
ca
n't
object
to
that
.
What
do
you
think
about
it
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
rather
hesitatingly
,
``
there
would
be
some
real
*NL*
advantages
in
that
...
and
I
honour
you
for
your
friendship
towards
him

*NL*
Bartle
.
But
...
you
must
be
careful
what
you
say
to
him
,
you
know
.
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
you
have
too
little
fellow-feeling
in
what
you
consider
his
*NL*
weakness
about
Hetty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
to
me
,
sir

trust
to
me

I
know
what
you

I
've
been
a
fool
*NL*
myself
in
my
time
,
but
that
's
between
you
and
me
.
I
sha
n't
thrust
myself
*NL*
on
him
only
keep
my
eye
on
him
,
and
see
that
he
gets
some
good
food
,
and
*NL*
put
in
a
word
here
and
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
reassured
a
little
as
to
Bartle
's
discretion
,
*NL*
``
I
think
you
'll
be
doing
a
good
deed
;
and
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
let

Adam
's
mother
and
brother
know
that
you
're
going

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

yes

said
Bartle
,
rising
,
and
taking
off
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
that
,
I
'll
do
that
;
though
the
mother
's
a
whimpering
*NL*
thing

I
do
n't
like
to
come
within
earshot
of
her
;
however
,
she
's
*NL*
a
straight-backed
,
clean
woman

none

your

I
wish
you
*NL*
good-bye

and
thank
you
for
the
time
you
've
spared
me

You

everybody

It

weight
you

got
on
your
shoulders

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye

Bartle

till
we
meet
at
Stoniton

as
I
daresay
we
shall

*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
hurried
away
from
the
rectory
,
evading
Carroll
's
conversational
*NL*
advances
,
and
saying
in
an
exasperated
tone
to
Vixen
,
whose
short
legs
*NL*
pattered
beside
him
on
the
gravel
,
``
Now

I
shall
be
obliged

take
you

go
fretting
yourself
to
death

if
I
left
you

you
know
you

perhaps
get
snapped
up
by
some

tramp

And
you
'll
be
running
into
bad
company

I
expect

putting
your

nose
in

*NL*
The
Eve
of
the
Trial
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AN
upper
room
in
a
dull
Stoniton
street
,
with
two
beds
in
it
--
one
laid
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
It
is
ten
o'clock
on
Thursday
night
,
and
the
dark
wall
*NL*
opposite
the
window
shuts
out
the
moonlight
that
might
have
struggled
*NL*
with
the
light
of
the
one
dip
candle
by
which
Bartle
Massey
is
*NL*
pretending
to
read
,
while
he
is
really
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
*NL*
Adam
Bede
,
seated
near
the
dark
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
would
hardly
have
known
it
was
Adam
without
being
told
.
His
face
has
*NL*
got
thinner
this
last
week
:
he
has
the
sunken
eyes
,
the
neglected
beard
*NL*
of
a
man
just
risen
from
a
sick-bed
.
His
heavy
black
hair
hangs
over
his
*NL*
forehead
,
and
there
is
no
active
impulse
in
him
which
inclines
him
to
*NL*
push
it
off
,
that
he
may
be
more
awake
to
what
is
around
him
.
He
has
one
*NL*
arm
over
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
he
seems
to
be
looking
down
at
his
*NL*
clasped
hands
.
He
is
roused
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
''
said
Bartle
Massey
,
rising
hastily
and
unfastening
the
*NL*
door
.
It
was
Mr.
Irwine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
rose
from
his
chair
with
instinctive
respect
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
approached
him
and
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
late
,
Adam
,
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
on
the
chair
which
Bartle
placed
*NL*
for
him
,
``
but
I
was
later
in
setting
off
from
Broxton
than
I
intended
*NL*
to
be
,
and
I
have
been
incessantly
occupied
since
I
arrived
.
I
have
done
*NL*
everything
now
,
however
--
everything
that
can
be
done
to-night
,
at
least
.
*NL*
Let
us
all
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
took
his
chair
again
mechanically
,
and
Bartle
,
for
whom
there
was
*NL*
no
chair
remaining
,
sat
on
the
bed
in
the
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
her
,
sir
?
''
said
Adam
tremulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Adam
;
I
and
the
chaplain
have
both
been
with
her
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ask
her
,
sir
...
did
you
say
anything
about
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
some
hesitation
,
``
I
spoke
of
you
.
I
said
*NL*
you
wished
to
see
her
before
the
trial
,
if
she
consented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr.
Irwine
paused
,
Adam
looked
at
him
with
eager
,
questioning
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
she
shrinks
from
seeing
any
one
,
Adam
.
It
is
not
only
*NL*
you
--
some
fatal
influence
seems
to
have
shut
up
her
heart
against
her
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
She
has
scarcely
said
anything
more
than
`
No
'
either
*NL*
to
me
or
the
chaplain
.
Three
or
four
days
ago
,
before
you
were
mentioned
*NL*
to
her
,
when
I
asked
her
if
there
was
any
one
of
her
family
whom
she
*NL*
would
like
to
see
--
to
whom
she
could
open
her
mind
--
she
said
,
with
a
*NL*
violent
shudder
,
`
Tell
them
not
to
come
near
me
--
I
wo
n't
see
any
of
*NL*
them
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
's
head
was
hanging
down
again
,
and
he
did
not
speak
.
There
was
*NL*
silence
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
Mr.
Irwine
said
,
``
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
to
advise
you
against
your
own
feelings
,
Adam
,
if
they
now
urge
you
*NL*
strongly
to
go
and
see
her
to-morrow
morning
,
even
without
her
consent
.
*NL*
It
is
just
possible
,
notwithstanding
appearances
to
the
contrary
,
that
*NL*
the
interview
might
affect
her
favourably
.
But
I
grieve
to
say
I
have
*NL*
scarcely
any
hope
of
that
.
She
did
n't
seem
agitated
when
I
mentioned
*NL*
your
name
;
she
only
said
`
No
,
'
in
the
same
cold
,
obstinate
way
as
usual
.
*NL*
And
if
the
meeting
had
no
good
effect
on
her
,
it
would
be
pure
,
useless
*NL*
suffering
to
you
--
severe
suffering
,
I
fear
.
She
is
very
much
changed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
started
up
from
his
chair
and
seized
his
hat
,
which
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
.
But
he
stood
still
then
,
and
looked
at
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
if
he
had
a
*NL*
question
to
ask
which
it
was
yet
difficult
to
utter
.
Bartle
Massey
rose
*NL*
quietly
,
turned
the
key
in
the
door
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
come
back
?
''
said
Adam
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
not
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
quietly
.
``
Lay
down
your
hat
,
Adam
,
*NL*
unless
you
like
to
walk
out
with
me
for
a
little
fresh
air
.
I
fear
you
*NL*
have
not
been
out
again
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
deceive
me
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
looking
hard
at
Mr.
Irwine
and
*NL*
speaking
in
a
tone
of
angry
suspicion
.
``
You
need
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
*NL*
I
only
want
justice
.
I
want
him
to
feel
what
she
feels
.
It
's
his
*NL*
work
...
she
was
a
child
as
it
`
ud
ha
'
gone
t

anybody
's
heart
to
look
*NL*
at
...
I
do
n't
care
what
she
's
done

it
was
him
brought
her
to
it

And
he
*NL*
shall
know
it

he
shall
feel
it

if
there
's
a
just
God
,
he
shall
feel
*NL*
what
it
is

ha

brought
a
child
like
her
to
sin
and
misery

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
deceiving
you
,
Adam
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
``
Arthur
Donnithorne
is
*NL*
not
come
back

was
not
come
back

I
left

I
have
left
a
letter
for
*NL*
him
:
he
will
know
all
as
soon
as
he
arrives

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
mind
about
it
,
''
said
Adam
indignantly
.
``
You
think
it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
as
she
lies
there
in
shame
and
misery
,
and
he
knows
*NL*
nothing
about
it
--
he
suffers
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
he
WILL
know
--
he
WILL
suffer
,
long
and
bitterly
.
He
has
a
heart
*NL*
and
a
conscience
:
I
ca
n't
be
entirely
deceived
in
his
character
.
I
am
*NL*
convinced
--
I
am
sure
he
did

fall
under
temptation
without
a
struggle

*NL*
He
may
be
weak
,
but
he
is
not
callous
,
not
coldly
selfish
.
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
that
this
will
be
a
shock
of
which
he
will
feel
the
effects
*NL*
all
his
life
.
Why
do
you
crave
vengeance
in
this
way
?
No
amount
of
*NL*
torture
that
you
could
inflict
on
him
could
benefit
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
O
God

no

Adam
groaned
out
,
sinking
on
his
chair
again
;
``
but
*NL*
then
,
that
's
the
deepest
curse
of
all

that

what
makes

blackness

of
it

IT
CAN
NEVER
BE
UNDONE

My
poor
Hetty

she
can
never

sweet
Hetty
again

the
prettiest

smiling
up

I
thought

*NL*
*NL*
Adam
's
voice
had
been
gradually
sinking
into
a
hoarse
undertone
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
only
talking
to
himself
;
but
now
he
said
abruptly
,
looking
at
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
,
``
But
she
is
n't
as
guilty
as
they
say
?
You
do
n't
think
she
*NL*
is
,
sir
?
She
ca
n't
ha

done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
perhaps
can
never
be
known
with
certainty
,
Adam
,
''
Mr.
Irwine
*NL*
answered
gently
.
``
In
these
cases
we
sometimes
form
our
judgment
on
what
*NL*
seems
to
us
strong
evidence
,
and
yet
,
for
want
of
knowing
some
small
*NL*
fact
,
our
judgment
is
wrong
.
But
suppose
the
worst
:
you
have
no
right
to
*NL*
say
that
the
guilt
of
her
crime
lies
with
him
,
and
that
he
ought
to
bear
*NL*
the
punishment
.
It
is
not
for
us
men
to
apportion
the
shares
of
moral
*NL*
guilt
and
retribution
.
We
find
it
impossible
to
avoid
mistakes
even
in
*NL*
determining
who
has
committed
a
single
criminal
act
,
and
the
problem
how
*NL*
far
a
man
is
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
unforeseen
consequences
of
*NL*
his
own
deed
is
one
that
might
well
make
us
tremble
to
look
into
it
.
*NL*
The
evil
consequences
that
may
lie
folded
in
a
single
act
of
selfish
*NL*
indulgence
is
a
thought
so
awful
that
it
ought
surely
to
awaken
some
*NL*
feeling
less
presumptuous
than
a
rash
desire
to
punish
.
You
have
a
mind
*NL*
that
can
understand
this
fully
,
Adam
,
when
you
are
calm
.
Do
n't
suppose
*NL*
I
ca
n't
enter
into
the
anguish
that
drives
you
into
this
state
*NL*
of
revengeful
hatred
.
But
think
of
this
:
if
you
were
to
obey
your
*NL*
passion
--
for
it
IS
passion
,
and
you
deceive
yourself
in
calling
it
*NL*
justice
--
it
might
be
with
you
precisely
as
it
has
been
with
Arthur
;
nay
,
*NL*
worse
;
your
passion
might
lead
you
yourself
into
a
horrible
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
worse
,
''
said
Adam
,
bitterly
;
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
's
worse
--
I
'd
*NL*
sooner
do
it

I
'd
sooner
do
a
wickedness
as
I
could
suffer
for
by
myself
*NL*
than
ha

brought
HER
to
do
wickedness
and
then
stand
by
and
see
'em
*NL*
punish
her
while
they
let
me
alone

all
for
a
bit

pleasure

him

he

cut
his
hand
off
sooner
than
*NL*
he

ha

taken
it
.
What
if
he
did

foresee
what
's
happened

He
foresaw
*NL*
enough
;
he
'd
no
right

expect
anything

harm

*NL*
then
he
wanted
to
smooth
it
off

No

there
's
plenty
o

things
*NL*
folks
are
hanged
for
not
half
so
hateful
as
that

Let
a
man
do
what
he
*NL*
will
,
if
he
knows
he
's
to
bear
the
punishment
himself
,
he
is

half
so
*NL*
bad
as
a
mean
selfish
coward
as
makes
things
easy
t

himself

knows
*NL*
all
the
while
the
punishment
'll
fall
on
somebody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
again
you
partly
deceive
yourself
,
Adam
.
There
is
no
sort
of
*NL*
wrong
deed
of
which
a
man
can
bear
the
punishment
alone
;
you
ca
n't
*NL*
isolate
yourself
and
say
that
the
evil
which
is
in
you
shall
not
spread
.
*NL*
Men
's
lives
are
as
thoroughly
blended
with
each
other
as
the
air
they
*NL*
breathe
:
evil
spreads
as
necessarily
as
disease
.
I
know
,
I
feel
the
*NL*
terrible
extent
of
suffering
this
sin
of
Arthur
's
has
caused
to
others
;
*NL*
but
so
does
every
sin
cause
suffering
to
others
besides
those
who
commit
*NL*
it
.
An
act
of
vengeance
on
your
part
against
Arthur
would
simply
be
*NL*
another
evil
added
to
those
we
are
suffering
under
:
you
could
not
bear
*NL*
the
punishment
alone
;
you
would
entail
the
worst
sorrows
on
every
one
*NL*
who
loves
you
.
You
would
have
committed
an
act
of
blind
fury
that
would
*NL*
leave
all
the
present
evils
just
as
they
were
and
add
worse
evils
to
*NL*
them
.
You
may
tell
me
that
you
meditate
no
fatal
act
of
vengeance
,
but
*NL*
the
feeling
in
your
mind
is
what
gives
birth
to
such
actions
,
and
as
*NL*
long
as
you
indulge
it
,
as
long
as
you
do
not
see
that
to
fix
your
mind
*NL*
on
Arthur
's
punishment
is
revenge
,
and
not
justice
,
you
are
in
danger
*NL*
of
being
led
on
to
the
commission
of
some
great
wrong
.
Remember
what
you
*NL*
told
me
about
your
feelings
after
you
had
given
that
blow
to
Arthur
in
*NL*
the
Grove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
silent
:
the
last
words
had
called
up
a
vivid
image
of
the
past
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
Irwine
left
him
to
his
thoughts
,
while
he
spoke
to
Bartle
Massey
*NL*
about
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
funeral
and
other
matters
of
an
indifferent
*NL*
kind
.
But
at
length
Adam
turned
round
and
said
,
in
a
more
subdued
tone
,
*NL*
``
I
've
not
asked
about
'em

th
'
Hall
Farm
,

Is
Mr.
Poyser
coming

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

he
is
in
Stoniton
to-night

But
I
could
not
advise
him
to
*NL*
see
you
,
Adam
.
His
own
mind
is
in
a
very
perturbed
state
,
and
it
is
best
*NL*
he
should
not
see
you
till
you
are
calmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Dinah
Morris
come

Seth
said
they

sent
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mr.
Poyser
tells
me
she

They
're
afraid
*NL*

not
reached
her

It
seems
they
had
no
exact
address

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
sat
ruminating
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
``
I
wonder
if
Dinah
*NL*

ha
'
gone
to

But
perhaps
the
Poysers
would
ha
'
been
sorely
*NL*
against
it
,
since
they
wo
n't
come
nigh
her
themselves
.
But
I
think
she
*NL*
would
,
for
the
Methodists
are
great
folks
for
going
into
the
prisons

*NL*
and
Seth
said
he
thought
she
would
.
She
'd
a
very
tender
way
with

Dinah
had

I
wonder
if
she
could

done
any
good

You
never

*NL*
sir
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
.
I
had
a
conversation
with
her

she
pleased
me
a
good
deal

*NL*
And
now
you
mention
it
,
I
wish
she
would
come
,
for
it
is
possible
that
a
*NL*
gentle
mild
woman
like
her
might
move
Hetty
to
open
her
heart
.
The
jail
*NL*
chaplain
is
rather
harsh
in
his
manner

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
o

no
use
if
she
does
n't
come

said
Adam
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
thought
of
it
earlier
,
I
would
have
taken
some
measures
*NL*
for
finding

out

said
Mr.
Irwine
,
``

Well

Chapter
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Morning
of
the
Trial
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AT
one
o'clock
the
next
day
,
Adam
was
alone
in
his
dull
upper
room
;
*NL*
his
watch
lay
before
him
on
the
table
,
as
if
he
were
counting
the
*NL*
long
minutes
.
He
had
no
knowledge
of
what
was
likely
to
be
said
by
*NL*
the
witnesses
on
the
trial
,
for
he
had
shrunk
from
all
the
particulars
*NL*
connected
with
Hetty
's
arrest
and
accusation
.
This
brave
active
man
,
who
*NL*
would
have
hastened
towards
any
danger
or
toil
to
rescue
Hetty
from
an
*NL*
apprehended
wrong
or
misfortune
,
felt
himself
powerless
to
contemplate
*NL*
irremediable
evil
and
suffering
.
The
susceptibility
which
would
have
*NL*
been
an
impelling
force
where
there
was
any
possibility
of
action
became
*NL*
helpless
anguish
when
he
was
obliged
to
be
passive
,
or
else
sought
an
*NL*
active
outlet
in
the
thought
of
inflicting
justice
on
Arthur
.
Energetic
*NL*
natures
,
strong
for
all
strenuous
deeds
,
will
often
rush
away
from
a
*NL*
hopeless
sufferer
,
as
if
they
were
hard-hearted
.
It
is
the
overmastering
*NL*
sense
of
pain
that
drives
them
.
They
shrink
by
an
ungovernable
instinct
,
*NL*
as
they
would
shrink
from
laceration
.
Adam
had
brought
himself
to
think
*NL*
of
seeing
Hetty
,
if
she
would
consent
to
see
him
,
because
he
thought
the
*NL*
meeting
might
possibly
be
a
good
to
her
--
might
help
to
melt
away
this
*NL*
terrible
hardness
they
told
him
of
.
If
she
saw
he
bore
her
no
ill
will
*NL*
for
what
she
had
done
to
him
,
she
might
open
her
heart
to
him
.
But
this
*NL*
resolution
had
been
an
immense
effort
--
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
seeing
her
changed
face
,
as
a
timid
woman
trembles
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
the
surgeon
's
knife
,
and
he
chose
now
to
bear
the
long
hours
of
suspense
*NL*
rather
than
encounter
what
seemed
to
him
the
more
intolerable
agony
of
*NL*
witnessing
her
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Deep
unspeakable
suffering
may
well
be
called
a
baptism
,
a
regeneration
,
*NL*
the
initiation
into
a
new
state
.
The
yearning
memories
,
the
bitter
*NL*
regret
,
the
agonized
sympathy
,
the
struggling
appeals
to
the
Invisible
*NL*
Right
--
all
the
intense
emotions
which
had
filled
the
days
and
nights
of
*NL*
the
past
week
,
and
were
compressing
themselves
again
like
an
eager
crowd
*NL*
into
the
hours
of
this
single
morning
,
made
Adam
look
back
on
all
the
*NL*
previous
years
as
if
they
had
been
a
dim
sleepy
existence
,
and
he
had
*NL*
only
now
awaked
to
full
consciousness
.
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
*NL*
always
before
thought
it
a
light
thing
that
men
should
suffer
,
as
if
all
*NL*
that
he
had
himself
endured
and
called
sorrow
before
was
only
a
moment
's
*NL*
stroke
that
had
never
left
a
bruise
.
Doubtless
a
great
anguish
may
do
*NL*
the
work
of
years
,
and
we
may
come
out
from
that
baptism
of
fire
with
a
*NL*
soul
full
of
new
awe
and
new
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
,
''
Adam
groaned
,
as
he
leaned
on
the
table
and
looked
blankly
at
*NL*
the
face
of
the
watch
,
``
and
men
have
suffered
like
this
before
...
and
*NL*
poor
helpless
young
things
have
suffered
like
her
...
Such
a
little
while
*NL*
ago
looking
so
happy
and
so
pretty
...
kissing
'em
all
,
her
grandfather
*NL*
and
all
of
'em
,
and
they
wishing
her
luck
...
O
my
poor
,
poor
*NL*
Hetty
...
dost
think
on
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
started
and
looked
round
towards
the
door
.
Vixen
had
begun
to
*NL*
whimper
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
a
stick
and
a
lame
walk
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
It
was
Bartle
Massey
come
back
.
Could
it
be
all
over
?
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
entered
quietly
,
and
,
going
up
to
Adam
,
grasped
his
hand
and
*NL*
said
,
``
I
'm
just
come
to
look
at
you
,
my
boy
,
for
the
folks
are
gone
out
*NL*
of
court
for
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
's
heart
beat
so
violently
he
was
unable
to
speak
--
he
could
only
*NL*
return
the
pressure
of
his
friend
's
hand
--
and
Bartle
,
drawing
up
the
*NL*
other
chair
,
came
and
sat
in
front
of
him
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
his
*NL*
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
,
''
he
observed
,
``
to
go
out
o
'
*NL*
the
door
with
my
spectacles
on
.
I
clean
forgot
to
take
'em
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
made
this
trivial
remark
,
thinking
it
better
not
to
respond
*NL*
at
all
to
Adam
's
agitation
:
he
would
gather
,
in
an
indirect
way
,
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
decisive
to
communicate
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
he
said
,
rising
again
,
``
I
must
see
to
your
having
a
bit
of
*NL*
the
loaf
,
and
some
of
that
wine
Mr.
Irwine
sent
this
morning
.
He
'll
be
*NL*
angry
with
me
if
you
do
n't
have
it
.
Come
,
now

''
he
went
on
,
bringing
*NL*
forward
the
bottle
and
the
loaf
and
pouring
some
wine
into
a
cup
,
``
I
*NL*
must
have
a
bit
and
a
sup
myself
.
Drink
a
drop
with
me
,
my
lad
--
drink
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
pushed
the
cup
gently
away
and
said
,
entreatingly
,
``
Tell
me
about
*NL*
it
,
Mr.
Massey
--
tell
me
all
about
it

Was
she
there

they
begun
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes

's
taken
all
the
time
since
I
first
went
;
but
*NL*
they
're
slow
,
they
're
slow

and
there
's

counsel
they
've
got
for
her

a
spoke
in
the
wheel
whenever
he
can
,
and
makes
a
deal
to
do
with
*NL*
cross-examining
the
witnesses
and
quarrelling
with
the
other
lawyers
.
*NL*
That
's
all
he
can
do
for
the
money
they
give
him
;
and
it
's
a
big
*NL*
sum

cute
fellow

with
an
eye

good
as
a
demonstration

listen
to
what
goes
on
in
court

a
tender
heart
makes
one
stupid
.
I
'd
have
given
up
figures
for
ever
*NL*
only
to
have
had
some
good
news
to
bring
to
you

poor
lad

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
it
seem
to
be
going
against
her

said
Adam
.
``
Tell

*NL*
``
Why

the
chief
evidence

has
been

Everybody
in
court
felt
for
him
--
it
was
like
one
*NL*
sob
,
the
sound
they
made
when
he
came
down
again
.
The
worst
was
when
*NL*
they
told
him
to
look
at

prisoner
at

bar

was
hard

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
had
made
the
right
sort
of
appeal
.
Adam
,
with
an
air
of
quiet
*NL*
obedience
,
took
up
the
cup
and
drank
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
how
SHE
looked
,
''
he
said
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frightened
,
very
frightened
,
when
they
first
brought
her
in
;
it
was
the
*NL*
first
sight
of
the
crowd
and
the
judge
,
poor
creatur
.
And
there
's
a
lot
*NL*
o
'
foolish
women
in
fine
clothes
,
with
gewgaws
all
up
their
arms
*NL*
and
feathers
on
their
heads
,
sitting
near
the
judge
:
they
've
dressed
*NL*
themselves
out
in
that
way
,
one
`
ud
think
,
to
be
scarecrows
and
warnings
*NL*
against
any
man
ever
meddling
with
a
woman
again
.
They
put
up
their
*NL*
glasses
,
and
stared
and
whispered
.
But
after
that
she
stood
like
a
white
*NL*
image
,
staring
down
at
her
hands
and
seeming
neither
to
hear
nor
see
*NL*
anything
.
And
she
's
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
She
did
n't
speak
when
they
*NL*
asked
her
if
she
'd
plead
`
guilty
'
or
`
not
guilty
,
'
and
they
pleaded
`
not
*NL*
guilty
'
for
her
.
But
when
she
heard
her
uncle
's
name
,
there
seemed
to
go
*NL*
a
shiver
right
through
her
;
and
when
they
told
him
to
look
at
her
,
she
*NL*
hung
her
head
down
,
and
cowered
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
He
'd
much
ado
to
speak
poor
man
,
his
voice
trembled
so
.
And
the
*NL*
counsellors
--
who
look
as
hard
as
nails
mostly
--
I
saw
,
spared
him
as
much
*NL*
as
they
could
.
Mr.
Irwine
put
himself
near
him
and
went
with
him
out
o
'
*NL*
court
.
Ah
,
it
's
a
great
thing
in
a
man
's
life
to
be
able
to
stand
by
a
*NL*

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
him

and
you
too
,
Mr.
Massey

''
said
Adam
,
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
laying
his
hand
on
Bartle
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
he
's
good
metal
;
he
gives
the
right
ring
when
you
try
him

*NL*
our
parson
does
.
A
man
o

sense
--
says
no
more
than
's
needful
.
He
's
not
*NL*
one
of
those
that
think
they
can
comfort
you
with
chattering
,
as
if
*NL*
folks
who
stand
by
and
look
on
knew
a
deal
better
what
the
trouble
was
*NL*
than
those
who
have
to
bear
it
.
I
've
had
to
do
with
such
folks
in
my
*NL*
time
--
in
the
south
,
when
I
was
in
trouble
myself
.
Mr.
Irwine
is
to
be
*NL*
a
witness
himself
,
by
and
by
,
on
her
side
,
you
know
,
to
speak
to
her
*NL*
character
and
bringing
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
other
evidence
...
does
it
go
hard
against
her
!
''
said
Adam
.
``
What
*NL*
do
you
think
,
Mr.
Massey
?
Tell
me
the
truth

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
lad
,
yes
.
The
truth
is
the
best
thing
to
tell

It
must
come
at
*NL*
last
.
The
doctors

evidence
is
heavy
on
her
--
is
heavy
.
But
she
's
gone
*NL*
on
denying
she
's
had
a
child
from
first
to
last

These
poor
silly
*NL*
women-things
--
they
've
not
the
sense
to
know
it
's
no
use
denying
what
's
*NL*
proved
.
It
'll
make
against
her
with
the
jury
,
I
doubt
,
her
being
so
*NL*
obstinate
:
they
may
be
less
for
recommending
her
to
mercy
,
if
the
*NL*
verdict
's
against
her
.
But
Mr.
Irwine
`
ull
leave
no
stone
unturned
with
*NL*
the
judge
--
you
may
rely
upon
that
,
Adam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nobody
to
stand
by
her
and
seem
to
care
for
her
in
the
court
?

*NL*
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
chaplain
o

the
jail
sits
near
her
,
but
he
's
a
sharp
*NL*
ferrety-faced
man
--
another
sort
o
'
flesh
and
blood
to
Mr.
Irwine
.
They
*NL*
say
the
jail
chaplains
are
mostly
the
fag-end
o

the
clergy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
man
as
ought
to
be
there
,
''
said
Adam
bitterly
.
Presently
he
*NL*
drew
himself
up
and
looked
fixedly
out
of
the
window
,
apparently
turning
*NL*
over
some
new
idea
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Massey
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
pushing
the
hair
off
his
forehead
,
``
I
'll
*NL*
go
back
with
you
.
I
'll
go
into
court
.
It
's
cowardly
of
me
to
keep
away
.
*NL*
I
'll
stand
by
her
--
I
'll
own
her
--
for
all
she
's
been
deceitful
.
They
*NL*
ought
n't
to
cast
her
off
--
her
own
flesh
and
blood
.
We
hand
folks
over
to
*NL*
God
's
mercy
,
and
show
none
ourselves
.
I
used
to
be
hard
sometimes
:
I
'll
*NL*
never
be
hard
again
.
I
'll
go
,
Mr.
Massey
--
I
'll
go
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
decision
in
Adam
's
manner
which
would
have
prevented
Bartle
*NL*
from
opposing
him
,
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
.
He
only
said
,
``
Take
*NL*
a
bit
,
then
,
and
another
sup
,
Adam
,
for
the
love
of
me

See
,
I
must
stop
*NL*
and
eat
a
morsel
.
Now
,
you
take
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nerved
by
an
active
resolution
,
Adam
took
a
morsel
of
bread
and
drank
*NL*
some
wine
.
He
was
haggard
and
unshaven
,
as
he
had
been
yesterday
,
but
he
*NL*
stood
upright
again
,
and
looked
more
like
the
Adam
Bede
of
former
days

Chapter
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdict
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
place
fitted
up
that
day
as
a
court
of
justice
was
a
grand
old
hall
,
*NL*
now
destroyed
by
fire
.
The
midday
light
that
fell
on
the
close
pavement
*NL*
of
human
heads
was
shed
through
a
line
of
high
pointed
windows
,
*NL*
variegated
with
the
mellow
tints
of
old
painted
glass
.
Grim
dusty
armour
*NL*
hung
in
high
relief
in
front
of
the
dark
oaken
gallery
at
the
farther
*NL*
end
,
and
under
the
broad
arch
of
the
great
mullioned
window
opposite
was
*NL*
spread
a
curtain
of
old
tapestry
,
covered
with
dim
melancholy
figures
,
*NL*
like
a
dozing
indistinct
dream
of
the
past
.
It
was
a
place
that
through
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
year
was
haunted
with
the
shadowy
memories
of
old
*NL*
kings
and
queens
,
unhappy
,
discrowned
,
imprisoned
;
but
to-day
all
those
*NL*
shadows
had
fled
,
and
not
a
soul
in
the
vast
hall
felt
the
presence
of
*NL*
any
but
a
living
sorrow
,
which
was
quivering
in
warm
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
sorrow
seemed
to
have
made
it
itself
feebly
felt
hitherto
,
now
*NL*
when
Adam
Bede
's
tall
figure
was
suddenly
seen
being
ushered
to
the
side
*NL*
of
the
prisoner
's
dock
.
In
the
broad
sunlight
of
the
great
hall
,
among
*NL*
the
sleek
shaven
faces
of
other
men
,
the
marks
of
suffering
in
his
face
*NL*
were
startling
even
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
had
last
seen
him
in
the
dim
*NL*
light
of
his
small
room
;
and
the
neighbours
from
Hayslope
who
were
*NL*
present
,
and
who
told
Hetty
Sorrel
's
story
by
their
firesides
in
their
*NL*
old
age
,
never
forgot
to
say
how
it
moved
them
when
Adam
Bede
,
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
taller
by
the
head
than
most
of
the
people
round
him
,
came
into
*NL*
court
and
took
his
place
by
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Hetty
did
not
see
him
.
She
was
standing
in
the
same
position
Bartle
*NL*
Massey
had
described
,
her
hands
crossed
over
each
other
and
her
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
them
.
Adam
had
not
dared
to
look
at
her
in
the
first
moments
,
*NL*
but
at
last
,
when
the
attention
of
the
court
was
withdrawn
by
the
*NL*
proceedings
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
with
a
resolution
not
to
*NL*
shrink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
did
they
say
she
was
so
changed
?
In
the
corpse
we
love
,
it
is
the
*NL*
likeness
we
see
--
it
is
the
likeness
,
which
makes
itself
felt
the
more
*NL*
keenly
because
something
else
was
and
is
not
.
There
they
were
--
the
sweet
*NL*
face
and
neck
,
with
the
dark
tendrils
of
hair
,
the
long
dark
lashes
,
the
*NL*
rounded
cheek
and
the
pouting
lips
--
pale
and
thin
,
yes
,
but
like
Hetty
,
*NL*
and
only
Hetty
.
Others
thought
she
looked
as
if
some
demon
had
cast
a
*NL*
blighting
glance
upon
her
,
withered
up
the
woman
's
soul
in
her
,
and
*NL*
left
only
a
hard
despairing
obstinacy
.
But
the
mother
's
yearning
,
that
*NL*
completest
type
of
the
life
in
another
life
which
is
the
essence
of
*NL*
real
human
love
,
feels
the
presence
of
the
cherished
child
even
in
the
*NL*
debased
,
degraded
man
;
and
to
Adam
,
this
pale
,
hard-looking
culprit
*NL*
was
the
Hetty
who
had
smiled
at
him
in
the
garden
under
the
apple-tree
*NL*
boughs
--
she
was
that
Hetty
's
corpse
,
which
he
had
trembled
to
look
at
*NL*
the
first
time
,
and
then
was
unwilling
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
presently
he
heard
something
that
compelled
him
to
listen
,
and
made
*NL*
the
sense
of
sight
less
absorbing
.
A
woman
was
in
the
witness-box
,
a
*NL*
middle-aged
woman
,
who
spoke
in
a
firm
distinct
voice
.
She
said
,
``
My
*NL*
name
is
Sarah
Stone
.
I
am
a
widow
,
and
keep
a
small
shop
licensed
to
*NL*
sell
tobacco
,
snuff
,
and
tea
in
Church
Lane
,
Stoniton
.
The
prisoner
at
*NL*
the
bar
is
the
same
young
woman
who
came
,
looking
ill
and
tired
,
with
*NL*
a
basket
on
her
arm
,
and
asked
for
a
lodging
at
my
house
on
Saturday
*NL*
evening
,
the
27th
of
February
.
She
had
taken
the
house
for
a
public
,
*NL*
because
there
was
a
figure
against
the
door
.
And
when
I
said
I
did
n't
*NL*
take
in
lodgers
,
the
prisoner
began
to
cry
,
and
said
she
was
too
tired
*NL*
to
go
anywhere
else
,
and
she
only
wanted
a
bed
for
one
night
.
And
her
*NL*
prettiness
,
and
her
condition
,
and
something
respectable
about
her
*NL*
clothes
and
looks
,
and
the
trouble
she
seemed
to
be
in
made
me
as
I
*NL*
could
n't
find
in
my
heart
to
send
her
away
at
once
.
I
asked
her
to
sit
*NL*
down
,
and
gave
her
some
tea
,
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
,
and
*NL*
where
her
friends
were
.
She
said
she
was
going
home
to
her
friends
:
they
*NL*
were
farming
folks
a
good
way
off
,
and
she
'd
had
a
long
journey
that
had
*NL*
cost
her
more
money
than
she
expected
,
so
as
she
'd
hardly
any
money
left
*NL*
in
her
pocket
,
and
was
afraid
of
going
where
it
would
cost
her
much
.
She
*NL*
had
been
obliged
to
sell
most
of
the
things
out
of
her
basket
,
but
she
'd
*NL*
thankfully
give
a
shilling
for
a
bed
.
I
saw
no
reason
why
I
should
n't
*NL*
take
the
young
woman
in
for
the
night
.
I
had
only
one
room
,
but
there
*NL*
were
two
beds
in
it
,
and
I
told
her
she
might
stay
with
me
.
I
thought
*NL*
she
'd
been
led
wrong
,
and
got
into
trouble
,
but
if
she
was
going
to
her
*NL*
friends
,
it
would
be
a
good
work
to
keep
her
out
of
further
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
witness
then
stated
that
in
the
night
a
child
was
born
,
and
she
*NL*
identified
the
baby-clothes
then
shown
to
her
as
those
in
which
she
had
*NL*
herself
dressed
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
the
clothes
.
I
made
them
myself
,
and
had
kept
them
by
me
*NL*
ever
since
my
last
child
was
born
.
I
took
a
deal
of
trouble
both
for
*NL*
the
child
and
the
mother
.
I
could
n't
help
taking
to
the
little
thing
and
*NL*
being
anxious
about
it
.
I
did
n't
send
for
a
doctor
,
for
there
seemed
no
*NL*
need
.
I
told
the
mother
in
the
day-time
she
must
tell
me
the
name
of
her
*NL*
friends
,
and
where
they
lived
,
and
let
me
write
to
them
.
She
said
,
by
*NL*
and
by
she
would
write
herself
,
but
not
to-day
.
She
would
have
no
nay
,
*NL*
but
she
would
get
up
and
be
dressed
,
in
spite
of
everything
I
could
say
.
*NL*
She
said
she
felt
quite
strong
enough
;
and
it
was
wonderful
what
spirit
*NL*
she
showed
.
But
I
was
n't
quite
easy
what
I
should
do
about
her
,
and
*NL*
towards
evening
I
made
up
my
mind
I
'd
go
,
after
Meeting
was
over
,
and
*NL*
speak
to
our
minister
about
it
.
I
left
the
house
about
half-past
eight
*NL*
o'clock
.
I
did
n't
go
out
at
the
shop
door
,
but
at
the
back
door
,
which
*NL*
opens
into
a
narrow
alley
.
I
've
only
got
the
ground-floor
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
both
look
into
the
alley
.
I
left
the
*NL*
prisoner
sitting
up
by
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
.
*NL*
She
had
n't
cried
or
seemed
low
at
all
,
as
she
did
the
night
before
.
I
*NL*
thought
she
had
a
strange
look
with
her
eyes
,
and
she
got
a
bit
flushed
*NL*
towards
evening
.
I
was
afraid
of
the
fever
,
and
I
thought
I
'd
call
and
*NL*
ask
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
an
experienced
woman
,
to
come
back
with
*NL*
me
when
I
went
out
.
It
was
a
very
dark
night
.
I
did
n't
fasten
the
door
*NL*
behind
me
;
there
was
no
lock
;
it
was
a
latch
with
a
bolt
inside
,
and
*NL*
when
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
I
always
went
out
at
the
shop
door
.
*NL*
But
I
thought
there
was
no
danger
in
leaving
it
unfastened
that
little
*NL*
while
.
I
was
longer
than
I
meant
to
be
,
for
I
had
to
wait
for
the
woman
*NL*
that
came
back
with
me
.
It
was
an
hour
and
a
half
before
we
got
back
,
*NL*
and
when
we
went
in
,
the
candle
was
standing
burning
just
as
I
left
it
,
*NL*
but
the
prisoner
and
the
baby
were
both
gone
.
She
'd
taken
her
cloak
and
*NL*
bonnet
,
but
she
'd
left
the
basket
and
the
things
in
it
...
I
was
*NL*
dreadful
frightened
,
and
angry
with
her
for
going
.
I
did
n't
go
to
give
*NL*
information
,
because
I
'd
no
thought
she
meant
to
do
any
harm
,
and
I
knew
*NL*
she
had
money
in
her
pocket
to
buy
her
food
and
lodging
.
I
did
n't
like
*NL*
to
set
the
constable
after
her
,
for
she
'd
a
right
to
go
from
me
if
she
*NL*
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
this
evidence
on
Adam
was
electrical
;
it
gave
him
new
*NL*
force
.
Hetty
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
crime
--
her
heart
must
have
clung
*NL*
to
her
baby
--
else
why
should
she
have
taken
it
with
her
?
She
might
have
*NL*
left
it
behind
.
The
little
creature
had
died
naturally
,
and
then
she
*NL*
had
hidden
it
.
Babies
were
so
liable
to
death
--
and
there
might
be
*NL*
the
strongest
suspicions
without
any
proof
of
guilt
.
His
mind
was
so
*NL*
occupied
with
imaginary
arguments
against
such
suspicions
,
that
he
*NL*
could
not
listen
to
the
cross-examination
by
Hetty
's
counsel
,
who
tried
,
*NL*
without
result
,
to
elicit
evidence
that
the
prisoner
had
shown
some
*NL*
movements
of
maternal
affection
towards
the
child
.
The
whole
time
this
*NL*
witness
was
being
examined
,
Hetty
had
stood
as
motionless
as
before
:
no
*NL*
word
seemed
to
arrest
her
ear
.
But
the
sound
of
the
next
witness
's
*NL*
voice
touched
a
chord
that
was
still
sensitive
,
she
gave
a
start
and
a
*NL*
frightened
look
towards
him
,
but
immediately
turned
away
her
head
and
*NL*
looked
down
at
her
hands
as
before
.
This
witness
was
a
man
,
a
rough
*NL*
peasant
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
John
Olding
.
I
am
a
labourer
,
and
live
at
Tedd
's
Hole
,
two
*NL*
miles
out
of
Stoniton
.
A
week
last
Monday
,
towards
one
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
I
was
going
towards
Hetton
Coppice
,
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
from
the
coppice
I
saw
the
prisoner
,
in
a
red
cloak
,
sitting
under
*NL*
a
bit
of
a
haystack
not
far
off
the
stile
.
She
got
up
when
she
saw
me
,
*NL*
and
seemed
as
if
she
'd
be
walking
on
the
other
way
.
It
was
a
regular
*NL*
road
through
the
fields
,
and
nothing
very
uncommon
to
see
a
young
woman
*NL*
there
,
but
I
took
notice
of
her
because
she
looked
white
and
scared
.
I
*NL*
should
have
thought
she
was
a
beggar-woman
,
only
for
her
good
clothes
.
I
*NL*
thought
she
looked
a
bit
crazy
,
but
it
was
no
business
of
mine
.
I
stood
*NL*
and
looked
back
after
her
,
but
she
went
right
on
while
she
was
in
sight
.
*NL*
I
had
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
coppice
to
look
after
some
stakes
.
*NL*
There
's
a
road
right
through
it
,
and
bits
of
openings
here
and
there
,
*NL*
where
the
trees
have
been
cut
down
,
and
some
of
'em
not
carried
away
.
*NL*
I
did
n't
go
straight
along
the
road
,
but
turned
off
towards
the
middle
,
*NL*
and
took
a
shorter
way
towards
the
spot
I
wanted
to
get
to
.
I
had
n't
got
*NL*
far
out
of
the
road
into
one
of
the
open
places
before
I
heard
a
strange
*NL*
cry
.
I
thought
it
did
n't
come
from
any
animal
I
knew
,
but
I
was
n't
for
*NL*
stopping
to
look
about
just
then
.
But
it
went
on
,
and
seemed
so
strange
*NL*
to
me
in
that
place
,
I
could
n't
help
stopping
to
look
.
I
began
to
think
*NL*
I
might
make
some
money
of
it
,
if
it
was
a
new
thing
.
But
I
had
hard
*NL*
work
to
tell
which
way
it
came
from
,
and
for
a
good
while
I
kept
looking
*NL*
up
at
the
boughs
.
And
then
I
thought
it
came
from
the
ground
;
and
there
*NL*
was
a
lot
of
timber-choppings
lying
about
,
and
loose
pieces
of
turf
,
and
*NL*
a
trunk
or
two
.
And
I
looked
about
among
them
,
but
could
find
nothing
,
*NL*
and
at
last
the
cry
stopped
.
So
I
was
for
giving
it
up
,
and
I
went
on
*NL*
about
my
business
.
But
when
I
came
back
the
same
way
pretty
nigh
an
hour
*NL*
after
,
I
could
n't
help
laying
down
my
stakes
to
have
another
look
.
And
*NL*
just
as
I
was
stooping
and
laying
down
the
stakes
,
I
saw
something
odd
*NL*
and
round
and
whitish
lying
on
the
ground
under
a
nut-bush
by
the
side
*NL*
of
me
.
And
I
stooped
down
on
hands
and
knees
to
pick
it
up
.
And
I
saw
it
*NL*
was
a
little
baby
's
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
a
thrill
ran
through
the
court
.
Hetty
was
visibly
*NL*
trembling
;
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
what
a
*NL*
witness
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
lot
of
timber-choppings
put
together
just
where
the
ground
*NL*
went
hollow
,
like
,
under
the
bush
,
and
the
hand
came
out
from
among
*NL*
them
.
But
there
was
a
hole
left
in
one
place
and
I
could
see
down
it
*NL*
and
see
the
child
's
head
;
and
I
made
haste
and
did
away
the
turf
and
the
*NL*
choppings
,
and
took
out
the
child
.
It
had
got
comfortable
clothes
on
,
*NL*
but
its
body
was
cold
,
and
I
thought
it
must
be
dead
.
I
made
haste
back
*NL*
with
it
out
of
the
wood
,
and
took
it
home
to
my
wife
.
She
said
it
was
*NL*
dead
,
and
I
'd
better
take
it
to
the
parish
and
tell
the
constable
.
And
I
*NL*
said
,
`
I
'll
lay
my
life
it
's
that
young
woman
's
child
as
I
met
going
to
*NL*
the
coppice
.
'
But
she
seemed
to
be
gone
clean
out
of
sight
.
And
I
took
*NL*
the
child
on
to
Hetton
parish
and
told
the
constable
,
and
we
went
on
to
*NL*
Justice
Hardy
.
And
then
we
went
looking
after
the
young
woman
till
dark
*NL*
at
night
,
and
we
went
and
gave
information
at
Stoniton
,
as
they
might
*NL*
stop
her
.
And
the
next
morning
,
another
constable
came
to
me
,
to
go
with
*NL*
him
to
the
spot
where
I
found
the
child
.
And
when
we
got
there
,
there
*NL*
was
the
prisoner
a-sitting
against
the
bush
where
I
found
the
child
;
and
*NL*
she
cried
out
when
she
saw
us
,
but
she
never
offered
to
move
.
She
'd
got
*NL*
a
big
piece
of
bread
on
her
lap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
given
a
faint
groan
of
despair
while
this
witness
was
speaking
.
*NL*
He
had
hidden
his
face
on
his
arm
,
which
rested
on
the
boarding
in
front
*NL*
of
him
.
It
was
the
supreme
moment
of
his
suffering
:
Hetty
was
guilty
;
*NL*
and
he
was
silently
calling
to
God
for
help
.
He
heard
no
more
of
the
*NL*
evidence
,
and
was
unconscious
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
*NL*
closed
--
unconscious
that
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
witness-box
,
telling
*NL*
of
Hetty
's
unblemished
character
in
her
own
parish
and
of
the
virtuous
*NL*
habits
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
.
This
testimony
could
have
no
*NL*
influence
on
the
verdict
,
but
it
was
given
as
part
of
that
plea
for
*NL*
mercy
which
her
own
counsel
would
have
made
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
*NL*
speak
for
her
--
a
favour
not
granted
to
criminals
in
those
stern
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Adam
lifted
up
his
head
,
for
there
was
a
general
movement
round
*NL*
him
.
The
judge
had
addressed
the
jury
,
and
they
were
retiring
.
The
*NL*
decisive
moment
was
not
far
off
.
Adam
felt
a
shuddering
horror
that
would
*NL*
not
let
him
look
at
Hetty
,
but
she
had
long
relapsed
into
her
blank
hard
*NL*
indifference
.
All
eyes
were
strained
to
look
at
her
,
but
she
stood
like
*NL*
a
statue
of
dull
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
was
a
mingled
rustling
,
whispering
,
and
low
buzzing
throughout
*NL*
the
court
during
this
interval
.
The
desire
to
listen
was
suspended
,
and
*NL*
every
one
had
some
feeling
or
opinion
to
express
in
undertones
.
Adam
*NL*
sat
looking
blankly
before
him
,
but
he
did
not
see
the
objects
that
were
*NL*
right
in
front
of
his
eyes
--
the
counsel
and
attorneys
talking
with
an
*NL*
air
of
cool
business
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
in
low
earnest
conversation
with
*NL*
the
judge
--
did
not
see
Mr.
Irwine
sit
down
again
in
agitation
and
shake
*NL*
his
head
mournfully
when
somebody
whispered
to
him
.
The
inward
action
*NL*
was
too
intense
for
Adam
to
take
in
outward
objects
until
some
strong
*NL*
sensation
roused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
very
long
,
hardly
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
before
*NL*
the
knock
which
told
that
the
jury
had
come
to
their
decision
fell
as
a
*NL*
signal
for
silence
on
every
ear
.
It
is
sublime
--
that
sudden
pause
of
a
*NL*
great
multitude
which
tells
that
one
soul
moves
in
them
all
.
Deeper
and
*NL*
deeper
the
silence
seemed
to
become
,
like
the
deepening
night
,
while
the
*NL*
jurymen
's
names
were
called
over
,
and
the
prisoner
was
made
to
hold
up
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
the
jury
were
asked
for
their
verdict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guilty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
verdict
every
one
expected
,
but
there
was
a
sigh
*NL*
of
disappointment
from
some
hearts
that
it
was
followed
by
no
*NL*
recommendation
to
mercy
.
Still
the
sympathy
of
the
court
was
not
with
*NL*
the
prisoner
.
The
unnaturalness
of
her
crime
stood
out
the
more
harshly
*NL*
by
the
side
of
her
hard
immovability
and
obstinate
silence
.
Even
the
*NL*
verdict
,
to
distant
eyes
,
had
not
appeared
to
move
her
,
but
those
who
*NL*
were
near
saw
her
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stillness
was
less
intense
until
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
,
and
*NL*
the
chaplain
in
his
canonicals
was
observed
behind
him
.
Then
it
deepened
*NL*
again
,
before
the
crier
had
had
time
to
command
silence
.
If
any
sound
*NL*
were
heard
,
it
must
have
been
the
sound
of
beating
hearts
.
The
judge
*NL*
spoke
,
``
Hester
Sorrel
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Hetty
's
face
,
and
then
fled
back
again
as
she
*NL*
looked
up
at
the
judge
and
kept
her
wide-open
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
as
if
*NL*
fascinated
by
fear
.
Adam
had
not
yet
turned
towards
her
,
there
was
a
*NL*
deep
horror
,
like
a
great
gulf
,
between
them
.
But
at
the
words
``
and
*NL*
then
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
you
be
dead
,
''
a
piercing
shriek
rang
*NL*
through
the
hall
.
It
was
Hetty
's
shriek
.
Adam
started
to
his
feet
and
*NL*
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
her
.
But
the
arms
could
not
reach
her
:
*NL*
she
had
fallen
down
in
a
fainting-fit
,
and
was
carried
out
of
court
.

Chapter
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
Return
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Arthur
Donnithorne
landed
at
Liverpool
and
read
the
letter
from
*NL*
his
Aunt
Lydia
,
briefly
announcing
his
grand-father
's
death
,
his
first
*NL*
feeling
was
,
``
Poor
Grandfather
!
I
wish
I
could
have
got
to
him
to
be
*NL*
with
him
when
he
died
.
He
might
have
felt
or
wished
something
at
the
*NL*
last
that
I
shall
never
know
now
.
It
was
a
lonely
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
say
that
his
grief
was
deeper
than
that
.
Pity
*NL*
and
softened
memory
took
place
of
the
old
antagonism
,
and
in
his
busy
*NL*
thoughts
about
the
future
,
as
the
chaise
carried
him
rapidly
along
*NL*
towards
the
home
where
he
was
now
to
be
master
,
there
was
a
continually
*NL*
recurring
effort
to
remember
anything
by
which
he
could
show
a
regard
*NL*
for
his
grandfather
's
wishes
,
without
counteracting
his
own
cherished
*NL*
aims
for
the
good
of
the
tenants
and
the
estate
.
But
it
is
not
in
human
*NL*
nature
--
only
in
human
pretence
--
for
a
young
man
like
Arthur
,
with
a
fine
*NL*
constitution
and
fine
spirits
,
thinking
well
of
himself
,
believing
that
*NL*
others
think
well
of
him
,
and
having
a
very
ardent
intention
to
give
*NL*
them
more
and
more
reason
for
that
good
opinion
--
it
is
not
possible
for
*NL*
such
a
young
man
,
just
coming
into
a
splendid
estate
through
the
*NL*
death
of
a
very
old
man
whom
he
was
not
fond
of
,
to
feel
anything
very
*NL*
different
from
exultant
joy
.
Now
his
real
life
was
beginning
;
now
he
*NL*
would
have
room
and
opportunity
for
action
,
and
he
would
use
them
.
He
*NL*
would
show
the
Loamshire
people
what
a
fine
country
gentleman
was
;
he
*NL*
would
not
exchange
that
career
for
any
other
under
the
sun
.
He
felt
*NL*
himself
riding
over
the
hills
in
the
breezy
autumn
days
,
looking
after
*NL*
favourite
plans
of
drainage
and
enclosure
;
then
admired
on
sombre
*NL*
mornings
as
the
best
rider
on
the
best
horse
in
the
hunt
;
spoken
well
*NL*
of
on
market-days
as
a
first-rate
landlord
;
by
and
by
making
speeches
at
*NL*
election
dinners
,
and
showing
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
agriculture
;
*NL*
the
patron
of
new
ploughs
and
drills
,
the
severe
upbraider
of
negligent
*NL*
landowners
,
and
withal
a
jolly
fellow
that
everybody
must
like
--
happy
*NL*
faces
greeting
him
everywhere
on
his
own
estate
,
and
the
neighbouring
*NL*
families
on
the
best
terms
with
him
.
The
Irwines
should
dine
with
him
*NL*
every
week
,
and
have
their
own
carriage
to
come
in
,
for
in
some
very
*NL*
delicate
way
that
Arthur
would
devise
,
the
lay-impropriator
of
the
*NL*
Hayslope
tithes
would
insist
on
paying
a
couple
of
hundreds
more
to
*NL*
the
vicar
;
and
his
aunt
should
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
,
and
go
on
*NL*
living
at
the
Chase
,
if
she
liked
,
in
spite
of
her
old-maidish
ways
--
at
*NL*
least
until
he
was
married
,
and
that
event
lay
in
the
indistinct
*NL*
background
,
for
Arthur
had
not
yet
seen
the
woman
who
would
play
the
*NL*
lady-wife
to
the
first-rate
country
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
Arthur
's
chief
thoughts
,
so
far
as
a
man
's
thoughts
through
*NL*
hours
of
travelling
can
be
compressed
into
a
few
sentences
,
which
are
*NL*
only
like
the
list
of
names
telling
you
what
are
the
scenes
in
a
long
*NL*
long
panorama
full
of
colour
,
of
detail
,
and
of
life
.
The
happy
faces
*NL*
Arthur
saw
greeting
him
were
not
pale
abstractions
,
but
real
ruddy
*NL*
faces
,
long
familiar
to
him
:
Martin
Poyser
was
there
--
the
whole
Poyser
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
--
Hetty
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
for
Arthur
was
at
ease
about
Hetty
--
not
quite
at
ease
about
the
*NL*
past
,
for
a
certain
burning
of
the
ears
would
come
whenever
he
thought
*NL*
of
the
scenes
with
Adam
last
August
,
but
at
ease
about
her
present
lot
.
*NL*
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
had
been
a
regular
correspondent
,
telling
him
all
the
*NL*
news
about
the
old
places
and
people
,
had
sent
him
word
nearly
three
*NL*
months
ago
that
Adam
Bede
was
not
to
marry
Mary
Burge
,
as
he
had
*NL*
thought
,
but
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
.
Martin
Poyser
and
Adam
himself
had
*NL*
both
told
Mr.
Irwine
all
about
it
--
that
Adam
had
been
deeply
in
love
*NL*
with
Hetty
these
two
years
,
and
that
now
it
was
agreed
they
were
to
be
*NL*
married
in
March
.
That
stalwart
rogue
Adam
was
more
susceptible
than
the
*NL*
rector
had
thought
;
it
was
really
quite
an
idyllic
love
affair
;
and
if
*NL*
it
had
not
been
too
long
to
tell
in
a
letter
,
he
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
describe
to
Arthur
the
blushing
looks
and
the
simple
strong
words
with
*NL*
which
the
fine
honest
fellow
told
his
secret
.
He
knew
Arthur
would
like
*NL*
to
hear
that
Adam
had
this
sort
of
happiness
in
prospect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
indeed
!
Arthur
felt
there
was
not
air
enough
in
the
room
to
satisfy
*NL*
his
renovated
life
,
when
he
had
read
that
passage
in
the
letter
.
He
*NL*
threw
up
the
windows
,
he
rushed
out
of
doors
into
the
December
air
,
and
*NL*
greeted
every
one
who
spoke
to
him
with
an
eager
gaiety
,
as
if
there
had
*NL*
been
news
of
a
fresh
Nelson
victory
.
For
the
first
time
that
day
since
*NL*
he
had
come
to
Windsor
,
he
was
in
true
boyish
spirits
.
The
load
that
*NL*
had
been
pressing
upon
him
was
gone
,
the
haunting
fear
had
vanished
.
He
*NL*
thought
he
could
conquer
his
bitterness
towards
Adam
now
--
could
offer
*NL*
him
his
hand
,
and
ask
to
be
his
friend
again
,
in
spite
of
that
painful
*NL*
memory
which
would
still
make
his
ears
burn
.
He
had
been
knocked
down
,
*NL*
and
he
had
been
forced
to
tell
a
lie
:
such
things
make
a
scar
,
do
what
*NL*
we
will
.
But
if
Adam
were
the
same
again
as
in
the
old
days
,
Arthur
*NL*
wished
to
be
the
same
too
,
and
to
have
Adam
mixed
up
with
his
business
*NL*
and
his
future
,
as
he
had
always
desired
before
the
accursed
meeting
*NL*
in
August
.
Nay
,
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
for
Adam
than
he
should
*NL*
otherwise
have
done
,
when
he
came
into
the
estate
;
Hetty
's
husband
had
*NL*
a
special
claim
on
him
--
Hetty
herself
should
feel
that
any
pain
she
*NL*
had
suffered
through
Arthur
in
the
past
was
compensated
to
her
a
*NL*
hundredfold
.
For
really
she
could
not
have
felt
much
,
since
she
had
so
*NL*
soon
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
perceive
clearly
what
sort
of
picture
Adam
and
Hetty
made
in
the
*NL*
panorama
of
Arthur
's
thoughts
on
his
journey
homeward
.
It
was
March
now
;
*NL*
they
were
soon
to
be
married
:
perhaps
they
were
already
married
.
And
now
*NL*
it
was
actually
in
his
power
to
do
a
great
deal
for
them
.
Sweet
--
sweet
*NL*
little
Hetty
!
The
little
puss
had
n't
cared
for
him
half
as
much
as
*NL*
he
cared
for
her
;
for
he
was
a
great
fool
about
her
still
--
was
almost
*NL*
afraid
of
seeing
her
--
indeed
,
had
not
cared
much
to
look
at
any
other
*NL*
woman
since
he
parted
from
her
.
That
little
figure
coming
towards
him
in
*NL*
the
Grove
,
those
dark-fringed
childish
eyes
,
the
lovely
lips
put
up
to
*NL*
kiss
him
--
that
picture
had
got
no
fainter
with
the
lapse
of
months
.
And
*NL*
she
would
look
just
the
same
.
It
was
impossible
to
think
how
he
could
*NL*
meet
her
:
he
should
certainly
tremble
.
Strange
,
how
long
this
sort
of
*NL*
influence
lasts
,
for
he
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
Hetty
now
.
He
*NL*
had
been
earnestly
desiring
,
for
months
,
that
she
should
marry
Adam
,
*NL*
and
there
was
nothing
that
contributed
more
to
his
happiness
in
these
*NL*
moments
than
the
thought
of
their
marriage
.
It
was
the
exaggerating
*NL*
effect
of
imagination
that
made
his
heart
still
beat
a
little
more
*NL*
quickly
at
the
thought
of
her
.
When
he
saw
the
little
thing
again
as
she
*NL*
really
was
,
as
Adam
's
wife
,
at
work
quite
prosaically
in
her
new
home
,
*NL*
he
should
perhaps
wonder
at
the
possibility
of
his
past
feelings
.
Thank
*NL*
heaven
it
had
turned
out
so
well
!
He
should
have
plenty
of
affairs
and
*NL*
interests
to
fill
his
life
now
,
and
not
be
in
danger
of
playing
the
fool
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pleasant
the
crack
of
the
post-boy
's
whip
!
Pleasant
the
sense
of
being
*NL*
hurried
along
in
swift
ease
through
English
scenes
,
so
like
those
round
*NL*
his
own
home
,
only
not
quite
so
charming
.
Here
was
a
market-town
--
very
*NL*
much
like
Treddleston
--
where
the
arms
of
the
neighbouring
lord
of
the
*NL*
manor
were
borne
on
the
sign
of
the
principal
inn
;
then
mere
fields
and
*NL*
hedges
,
their
vicinity
to
a
market-town
carrying
an
agreeable
suggestion
*NL*
of
high
rent
,
till
the
land
began
to
assume
a
trimmer
look
,
the
woods
*NL*
were
more
frequent
,
and
at
length
a
white
or
red
mansion
looked
down
*NL*
from
a
moderate
eminence
,
or
allowed
him
to
be
aware
of
its
parapet
*NL*
and
chimneys
among
the
dense-looking
masses
of
oaks
and
elms
--
masses
*NL*
reddened
now
with
early
buds
.
And
close
at
hand
came
the
village
:
the
*NL*
small
church
,
with
its
red-tiled
roof
,
looking
humble
even
among
the
*NL*
faded
half-timbered
houses
;
the
old
green
gravestones
with
nettles
round
*NL*
them
;
nothing
fresh
and
bright
but
the
children
,
opening
round
eyes
at
*NL*
the
swift
post-chaise
;
nothing
noisy
and
busy
but
the
gaping
curs
of
*NL*
mysterious
pedigree
.
What
a
much
prettier
village
Hayslope
was
!
And
it
*NL*
should
not
be
neglected
like
this
place
:
vigorous
repairs
should
go
*NL*
on
everywhere
among
farm-buildings
and
cottages
,
and
travellers
in
*NL*
post-chaises
,
coming
along
the
Rosseter
road
,
should
do
nothing
but
*NL*
admire
as
they
went
.
And
Adam
Bede
should
superintend
all
the
repairs
,
*NL*
for
he
had
a
share
in
Burge
's
business
now
,
and
,
if
he
liked
,
Arthur
*NL*
would
put
some
money
into
the
concern
and
buy
the
old
man
out
in
another
*NL*
year
or
two
.
That
was
an
ugly
fault
in
Arthur
's
life
,
that
affair
last
*NL*
summer
,
but
the
future
should
make
amends
.
Many
men
would
have
retained
*NL*
a
feeling
of
vindictiveness
towards
Adam
,
but
he
would
not
--
he
would
*NL*
resolutely
overcome
all
littleness
of
that
kind
,
for
he
had
certainly
*NL*
been
very
much
in
the
wrong
;
and
though
Adam
had
been
harsh
and
violent
,
*NL*
and
had
thrust
on
him
a
painful
dilemma
,
the
poor
fellow
was
in
love
,
*NL*
and
had
real
provocation
.
No
,
Arthur
had
not
an
evil
feeling
in
his
mind
*NL*
towards
any
human
being
:
he
was
happy
,
and
would
make
every
one
else
*NL*
happy
that
came
within
his
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
was
dear
old
Hayslope
at
last
,
sleeping
,
on
the
hill
,
like
a
*NL*
quiet
old
place
as
it
was
,
in
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
,
and
opposite
*NL*
to
it
the
great
shoulders
of
the
Binton
Hills
,
below
them
the
purplish
*NL*
blackness
of
the
hanging
woods
,
and
at
last
the
pale
front
of
the
Abbey
,
*NL*
looking
out
from
among
the
oaks
of
the
Chase
,
as
if
anxious
for
the
*NL*
heir
's
return
.
``
Poor
Grandfather
!
And
he
lies
dead
there
.
He
was
a
young
*NL*
fellow
once
,
coming
into
the
estate
and
making
his
plans
.
So
the
world
*NL*
goes
round
!
Aunt
Lydia
must
feel
very
desolate
,
poor
thing
;
but
she
*NL*
shall
be
indulged
as
much
as
she
indulges
her
fat
Fido
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wheels
of
Arthur
's
chaise
had
been
anxiously
listened
for
at
the
*NL*
Chase
,
for
to-day
was
Friday
,
and
the
funeral
had
already
been
deferred
*NL*
two
days
.
Before
it
drew
up
on
the
gravel
of
the
courtyard
,
all
the
*NL*
servants
in
the
house
were
assembled
to
receive
him
with
a
grave
,
decent
*NL*
welcome
,
befitting
a
house
of
death
.
A
month
ago
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
difficult
for
them
to
have
maintained
a
suitable
sadness
in
their
*NL*
faces
,
when
Mr.
Arthur
was
come
to
take
possession
;
but
the
hearts
of
*NL*
the
head-servants
were
heavy
that
day
for
another
cause
than
the
death
*NL*
of
the
old
squire
,
and
more
than
one
of
them
was
longing
to
be
twenty
*NL*
miles
away
,
as
Mr.
Craig
was
,
knowing
what
was
to
become
of
Hetty
*NL*
Sorrel
--
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
--
whom
they
used
to
see
every
week
.
They
had
*NL*
the
partisanship
of
household
servants
who
like
their
places
,
and
*NL*
were
not
inclined
to
go
the
full
length
of
the
severe
indignation
felt
*NL*
against
him
by
the
farming
tenants
,
but
rather
to
make
excuses
for
him
;
*NL*
nevertheless
,
the
upper
servants
,
who
had
been
on
terms
of
neighbourly
*NL*
intercourse
with
the
Poysers
for
many
years
,
could
not
help
feeling
that
*NL*
the
longed-for
event
of
the
young
squire
's
coming
into
the
estate
had
*NL*
been
robbed
of
all
its
pleasantness
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Arthur
it
was
nothing
surprising
that
the
servants
looked
grave
and
*NL*
sad
:
he
himself
was
very
much
touched
on
seeing
them
all
again
,
and
*NL*
feeling
that
he
was
in
a
new
relation
to
them
.
It
was
that
sort
of
*NL*
pathetic
emotion
which
has
more
pleasure
than
pain
in
it
--
which
is
*NL*
perhaps
one
of
the
most
delicious
of
all
states
to
a
good-natured
man
,
*NL*
conscious
of
the
power
to
satisfy
his
good
nature
.
His
heart
swelled
*NL*
agreeably
as
he
said
,
``
Well
,
Mills
,
how
is
my
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Mr.
Bygate
,
the
lawyer
,
who
had
been
in
the
house
ever
since
*NL*
the
death
,
came
forward
to
give
deferential
greetings
and
answer
all
*NL*
questions
,
and
Arthur
walked
with
him
towards
the
library
,
where
his
*NL*
Aunt
Lydia
was
expecting
him
.
Aunt
Lydia
was
the
only
person
in
the
*NL*
house
who
knew
nothing
about
Hetty
.
Her
sorrow
as
a
maiden
daughter
*NL*
was
unmixed
with
any
other
thoughts
than
those
of
anxiety
about
funeral
*NL*
arrangements
and
her
own
future
lot
;
and
,
after
the
manner
of
women
,
*NL*
she
mourned
for
the
father
who
had
made
her
life
important
,
all
the
more
*NL*
because
she
had
a
secret
sense
that
there
was
little
mourning
for
him
in
*NL*
other
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Arthur
kissed
her
tearful
face
more
tenderly
than
he
had
ever
done
*NL*
in
his
life
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Aunt
,
''
he
said
affectionately
,
as
he
held
her
hand
,
``
YOUR
loss
is
*NL*
the
greatest
of
all
,
but
you
must
tell
me
how
to
try
and
make
it
up
to
*NL*
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
so
sudden
and
so
dreadful
,
Arthur
,
''
poor
Miss
Lydia
began
,
*NL*
pouring
out
her
little
plaints
,
and
Arthur
sat
down
to
listen
with
*NL*
impatient
patience
.
When
a
pause
came
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Aunt
,
I
'll
leave
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
just
to
go
to
my
own
*NL*
room
,
and
then
I
shall
come
and
give
full
attention
to
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
room
is
all
ready
for
me
,
I
suppose
,
Mills
?
''
he
said
to
the
butler
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
be
lingering
uneasily
about
the
entrance-hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
and
there
are
letters
for
you
;
they
are
all
laid
on
the
*NL*
writing-table
in
your
dressing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
small
anteroom
which
was
called
a
dressing-room
,
but
*NL*
which
Arthur
really
used
only
to
lounge
and
write
in
,
he
just
cast
his
*NL*
eyes
on
the
writing-table
,
and
saw
that
there
were
several
letters
and
*NL*
packets
lying
there
;
but
he
was
in
the
uncomfortable
dusty
condition
*NL*
of
a
man
who
has
had
a
long
hurried
journey
,
and
he
must
really
refresh
*NL*
himself
by
attending
to
his
toilette
a
little
,
before
he
read
his
*NL*
letters
.
Pym
was
there
,
making
everything
ready
for
him
,
and
soon
,
with
*NL*
a
delightful
freshness
about
him
,
as
if
he
were
prepared
to
begin
a
new
*NL*
day
,
he
went
back
into
his
dressing-room
to
open
his
letters
.
The
level
*NL*
rays
of
the
low
afternoon
sun
entered
directly
at
the
window
,
and
as
*NL*
Arthur
seated
himself
in
his
velvet
chair
with
their
pleasant
warmth
*NL*
upon
him
,
he
was
conscious
of
that
quiet
well-being
which
perhaps
you
*NL*
and
I
have
felt
on
a
sunny
afternoon
when
,
in
our
brightest
youth
and
*NL*
health
,
life
has
opened
a
new
vista
for
us
,
and
long
to-morrows
of
*NL*
activity
have
stretched
before
us
like
a
lovely
plain
which
there
was
no
*NL*
need
for
hurrying
to
look
at
,
because
it
was
all
our
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
top
letter
was
placed
with
its
address
upwards
:
it
was
in
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
's
handwriting
,
Arthur
saw
at
once
;
and
below
the
address
was
*NL*
written
,
``
To
be
delivered
as
soon
as
he
arrives
.
''
Nothing
could
have
*NL*
been
less
surprising
to
him
than
a
letter
from
Mr.
Irwine
at
that
*NL*
moment
:
of
course
,
there
was
something
he
wished
Arthur
to
know
earlier
*NL*
than
it
was
possible
for
them
to
see
each
other
.
At
such
a
time
as
that
*NL*
it
was
quite
natural
that
Irwine
should
have
something
pressing
to
say
.
*NL*
Arthur
broke
the
seal
with
an
agreeable
anticipation
of
soon
seeing
the
*NL*
writer
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
send
this
letter
to
meet
you
on
your
arrival
,
Arthur
,
because
I
may
*NL*
then

*NL*
Arthur
read
no
more
.
He
started
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
for
a
single
*NL*
minute
with
a
sense
of
violent
convulsion
in
his
whole
frame
,
as
if
the
*NL*
life
were
going
out
of
him
with
horrible
throbs
;
but
the
next
minute
he
*NL*
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
still
clutching
the
letter
--
he
was
hurrying
*NL*
along
the
corridor
,
and
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
.
Mills
was
still
*NL*
there
,
but
Arthur
did
not
see
him
,
as
he
passed
like
a
hunted
man
across
*NL*
the
hall
and
out
along
the
gravel
.
The
butler
hurried
out
after
him
*NL*
as
fast
as
his
elderly
limbs
could
run
:
he
guessed
,
he
knew
,
where
the
*NL*
young
squire
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mills
got
to
the
stables
,
a
horse
was
being
saddled
,
and
Arthur
was
*NL*
forcing
himself
to
read
the
remaining
words
of
the
letter
.
He
thrust
*NL*
it
into
his
pocket
as
the
horse
was
led
up
to
him
,
and
at
that
moment
*NL*
caught
sight
of
Mills
'
anxious
face
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
them
I
'm
gone
--
gone
to
Stoniton
,
''
he
said
in
a
muffled
tone
of
*NL*
agitation
--
sprang
into
the
saddle
,
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
.

Chapter
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Prison
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NEAR
sunset
that
evening
an
elderly
gentleman
was
standing
with
his
back
*NL*
against
the
smaller
entrance-door
of
Stoniton
jail
,
saying
a
few
last
*NL*
words
to
the
departing
chaplain
.
The
chaplain
walked
away
,
but
the
*NL*
elderly
gentleman
stood
still
,
looking
down
on
the
pavement
and
stroking
*NL*
his
chin
with
a
ruminating
air
,
when
he
was
roused
by
a
sweet
clear
*NL*
woman
's
voice
,
saying
,
``
Can
I
get
into
the
prison
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
head
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
speaker
for
a
few
moments
*NL*
without
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
you
before
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
Do
you
remember
preaching
on
*NL*
the
village
green
at
Hayslope
in
Loamshire

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

``

ringing

gaining

*NL*
Dinah
mechanically
took
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
as
soon
as
they
were
*NL*
within
the
prison
court
,
from
the
habit
she
had
of
throwing
them
off
*NL*
when
she
preached
or
prayed
,
or
visited
the
sick
;
and
when
they
entered
*NL*
the
jailer
's
room
,
she
laid
them
down
on
a
chair
unthinkingly
.
There
was
*NL*
no
agitation
visible
in
her
,
but
a
deep
concentrated
calmness
,
as
if
,
*NL*
even
when
she
was
speaking
,
her
soul
was
in
prayer
reposing
on
an
unseen
*NL*
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
speaking
to
the
jailer
,
the
magistrate
turned
to
her
and
said
,
*NL*
``
The
turnkey
will
take
you
to
the
prisoner
's
cell
and
leave
you
there
*NL*
for
the
night
,
if
you
desire
it
,
but
you
ca
n't
have
a
light
during
the
*NL*
night
--
it
is
contrary
to
rules
.
My
name
is
Colonel
Townley
:
if
I
can
*NL*
help
you
in
anything
,
ask
the
jailer
for
my
address
and
come
to
me
.
*NL*
I
take
some
interest
in
this
Hetty
Sorrel
,
for
the
sake
of
that
fine
*NL*
fellow
,
Adam
Bede
.
I
happened
to
see
him
at
Hayslope
the
same
evening
I
*NL*
heard
you
preach
,
and
recognized
him
in
court
to-day
,
ill
as
he
looked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
him
?
Can
you
tell
me
where
*NL*
he
lodges
?
For
my
poor
uncle
was
too
much
weighed
down
with
trouble
to
*NL*
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
by
here
.
I
inquired
all
about
him
of
Mr.
Irwine
.
He
lodges
over
*NL*
a
tinman
's
shop
,
in
the
street
on
the
right
hand
as
you
entered
the
*NL*
prison
.
There
is
an
old
school-master
with
him
.
Now
,
good-bye
:
I
wish
*NL*
you
success
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell

sir

I
am
grateful
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Dinah
crossed
the
prison
court
with
the
turnkey
,
the
solemn
evening
*NL*
light
seemed
to
make
the
walls
higher
than
they
were
by
day
,
and
the
*NL*
sweet
pale
face
in
the
cap
was
more
than
ever
like
a
white
flower
on
*NL*
this
background
of
gloom
.
The
turnkey
looked
askance
at
her
all
the
*NL*
while
,
but
never
spoke
.
He
somehow
felt
that
the
sound
of
his
own
rude
*NL*
voice
would
be
grating
just
then
.
He
struck
a
light
as
they
entered
the
*NL*
dark
corridor
leading
to
the
condemned
cell
,
and
then
said
in
his
most
*NL*
civil
tone
,
``
It
'll
be
pretty
nigh
dark
in
the
cell
a
`
ready
,
but
I
can
*NL*
stop
with
my
light
a
bit
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
friend
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Dinah
.
``
I
wish
to
go
in
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
''
said
the
jailer
,
turning
the
harsh
key
in
the
lock
and
*NL*
opening
the
door
wide
enough
to
admit
Dinah
.
A
jet
of
light
from
his
*NL*
lantern
fell
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
cell
,
where
Hetty
was
sitting
*NL*
on
her
straw
pallet
with
her
face
buried
in
her
knees
.
It
seemed
as
if
*NL*
she
were
asleep
,
and
yet
the
grating
of
the
lock
would
have
been
likely
*NL*
to
waken
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
closed
again
,
and
the
only
light
in
the
cell
was
that
of
the
*NL*
evening
sky
,
through
the
small
high
grating
--
enough
to
discern
human
*NL*
faces
by
.
Dinah
stood
still
for
a
minute
,
hesitating
to
speak
because
*NL*
Hetty
might
be
asleep
,
and
looking
at
the
motionless
heap
with
a
*NL*
yearning
heart
.
Then
she
said
,
softly
,
``
Hetty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
movement
perceptible
in
Hetty
's
frame
--
a
start
such
*NL*
as
might
have
been
produced
by
a
feeble
electrical
shock
--
but
she
did
*NL*
not
look
up
.
Dinah
spoke
again
,
in
a
tone
made
stronger
by
irrepressible
*NL*
emotion
,
``
Hetty
...
it
's
Dinah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
a
slight
startled
movement
through
Hetty
's
frame
,
*NL*
and
without
uncovering
her
face
,
she
raised
her
head
a
little
,
as
if
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hetty
...
Dinah
is
come
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
Hetty
lifted
her
head
slowly
and
timidly
from
*NL*
her
knees
and
raised
her
eyes
.
The
two
pale
faces
were
looking
at
*NL*
each
other
:
one
with
a
wild
hard
despair
in
it
,
the
other
full
of
sad
*NL*
yearning
love
.
Dinah
unconsciously
opened
her
arms
and
stretched
them
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
me
,
Hetty
?
Do
n't
you
remember
Dinah
?
Did
you
think
I
*NL*
would
n't
come
to
you
in
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
Dinah
's
face
--
at
first
like
an
animal
that
*NL*
gazes
,
and
gazes
,
and
keeps
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
come
to
be
with
you
,
Hetty
--
not
to
leave
you
--
to
stay
with
you
--
to
*NL*
be
your
sister
to
the
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
,
while
Dinah
was
speaking
,
Hetty
rose
,
took
a
step
forward
,
and
*NL*
was
clasped
in
Dinah
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
so
a
long
while
,
for
neither
of
them
felt
the
impulse
to
move
*NL*
apart
again
.
Hetty
,
without
any
distinct
thought
of
it
,
hung
on
this
*NL*
something
that
was
come
to
clasp
her
now
,
while
she
was
sinking
helpless
*NL*
in
a
dark
gulf
;
and
Dinah
felt
a
deep
joy
in
the
first
sign
that
her
*NL*
love
was
welcomed
by
the
wretched
lost
one
.
The
light
got
fainter
as
*NL*
they
stood
,
and
when
at
last
they
sat
down
on
the
straw
pallet
together
,
*NL*
their
faces
had
become
indistinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
Dinah
waited
,
hoping
for
a
spontaneous
word
from
*NL*
Hetty
,
but
she
sat
in
the
same
dull
despair
,
only
clutching
the
hand
*NL*
that
held
hers
and
leaning
her
cheek
against
Dinah
's
.
It
was
the
human
*NL*
contact
she
clung
to
,
but
she
was
not
the
less
sinking
into
the
dark
*NL*
gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
began
to
doubt
whether
Hetty
was
conscious
who
it
was
that
sat
*NL*
beside
her
.
She
thought
suffering
and
fear
might
have
driven
the
poor
*NL*
sinner
out
of
her
mind
.
But
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
,
as
she
afterwards
*NL*
said
,
that
she
must
not
hurry
God
's
work
:
we
are
overhasty
to
speak
--
as
*NL*
if
God
did
not
manifest
himself
by
our
silent
feeling
,
and
make
his
love
*NL*
felt
through
ours
.
She
did
not
know
how
long
they
sat
in
that
way
,
but
*NL*
it
got
darker
and
darker
,
till
there
was
only
a
pale
patch
of
light
on
*NL*
the
opposite
wall
:
all
the
rest
was
darkness
.
But
she
felt
the
Divine
*NL*
presence
more
and
more
--
nay
,
as
if
she
herself
were
a
part
of
it
,
and
*NL*
it
was
the
Divine
pity
that
was
beating
in
her
heart
and
was
willing
the
*NL*
rescue
of
this
helpless
one
.
At
last
she
was
prompted
to
speak
and
find
*NL*
out
how
far
Hetty
was
conscious
of
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hetty
,
''
she
said
gently
,
``
do
you
know
who
it
is
that
sits
by
your
*NL*
side
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Hetty
answered
slowly
,
``
it
's
Dinah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
remember
the
time
when
we
were
at
the
Hall
Farm
together
,
*NL*
and
that
night
when
I
told
you
to
be
sure
and
think
of
me
as
a
friend
in
*NL*
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hetty
.
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
she
added
,
``
But
you
can
do
*NL*
nothing
for
me
.
You
ca
n't
make
'em
do
anything
.
They
'll
hang
me
o
'
*NL*
Monday
--
it
's
Friday
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Hetty
said
the
last
words
,
she
clung
closer
to
Dinah
,
shuddering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Hetty
,
I
ca
n't
save
you
from
that
death
.
But
is
n't
the
suffering
*NL*
less
hard
when
you
have
somebody
with
you
,
that
feels
for
you
--
that
you
*NL*
can
speak
to
,
and
say
what
's
in
your
heart
?
...
Yes
,
Hetty
:
you
lean
on
*NL*
me
:
you
are
glad
to
have
me
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
leave
me
,
Dinah
?
You
'll
keep
close
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Hetty
,
I
wo
n't
leave
you
.
I
'll
stay
with
you
to
the
last
...
But
,
*NL*
Hetty
,
there
is
some
one
else
in
this
cell
besides
me
,
some
one
close
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
said
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
,
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
who
has
been
with
you
through
all
your
hours
of
sin
and
*NL*
trouble
--
who
has
known
every
thought
you
have
had
--
has
seen
where
you
*NL*
went
,
where
you
lay
down
and
rose
up
again
,
and

He

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

death

I

neither

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't

Hetty
said
,
with
sullen
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
Hetty
,
you
are
shutting
up
your
soul
against
him
,
by
trying
*NL*
to
hide
the
truth
.
God
's
love
and
mercy
can
overcome
all
things
--
our
*NL*
ignorance
,
and
weakness
,
and
all
the
burden
of
our
past
wickedness
--
all
*NL*
things
but
our
wilful
sin
,
sin
that
we
cling
to
,
and
will
not
give
up
.
*NL*
You
believe
in
my
love
and
pity
for
you

Hetty
,
but
if
you
had
not
let
*NL*
me
come
near
you
,
if
you
would
n't
have
looked
at
me
or
spoken
to
me
,
*NL*
you
'd
have
shut
me
out
from
helping
you

I
could

have
made
you

I

Do
n't
shut
God

love
out

by
clinging

sin

He

you
have
one
falsehood
in
your
soul

*NL*
you
until
you
open
your

to
him

I
have
done
this
great

wickedness

O
God

save
me

make
me
pure
from
sin

While
you
cling
to
*NL*
one
sin
and
will
not
part
with
it

it
must
drag
you
down
to
misery
after

death
,
as
it
has
dragged
you
to
misery
here
in
this

,
my
poor

poor
*NL*
Hetty

It
is
sin
that
brings
dread
,
and
darkness
,
and
despair
:
there
is
*NL*
light
and
blessedness
for
us
as
soon
as
we
cast

off

God
enters
our

teaches

brings
us
strength

peace

Cast
it
*NL*
off
now

Hetty

now
:
confess
the
wickedness
you
have
done

the
sin
you
*NL*
have
been
guilty
of
against
your
Heavenly

Let

kneel
down
*NL*
together

*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
obeyed
Dinah
's
movement
,
and
sank
on
her
knees
.
They
still
held
*NL*
each
other
's
hands
,
and
there
was
long
silence

Then
Dinah
said
,
``
Hetty

He
is
waiting
for

to
tell
the

*NL*
Still
there
was
silence

At
last
Hetty
spoke
,
in
a
tone
of
beseeching
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinah

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
held
the
clinging
hand
,

all
her
soul
went
forth
in
her
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus

thou
present
Saviour

Thou
hast
known
the
depths
of
all
sorrow
:
*NL*
thou
hast
entered
that
black
darkness
where
God
is
not
,
and
hast
uttered
*NL*
the
cry
of
the
forsaken
.
Come
Lord

and
gather
of
the
fruits
of
thy
*NL*
travail

thy
pleading

Stretch
forth
thy
hand

thou
who
art
mighty

to
save
to
the
uttermost
,

rescue
this
lost
one

She
is
clothed
round
*NL*
with
thick
darkness

The
fetters
of
her
sin
are
upon
her
,
and
she
can
not
*NL*
stir
to
come
to
thee
.
She
can
only
feel
her
heart
is
hard
,
and
she
is
*NL*
helpless

She
cries
to
me
,
thy
weak
creature
...
Saviour
!
It
is
a
blind
*NL*
cry
to
thee

Hear
it
!
Pierce
the
darkness
!
Look
upon
her
with
thy
face
*NL*
of
love

sorrow
that
thou
didst
turn
on
him
who
denied
thee

melt
*NL*
her
hard
heart

*NL*

I
bring
her

didst
heal
them
.
I
bear
her
on
my
arms
and
carry
her
before
*NL*
thee

Fear
and
trembling
have
taken
hold
on
her
,
but
she
trembles
only
*NL*
at
the
pain
and
death
of
the
body

Breathe
upon
her
thy
life-giving
*NL*
Spirit
,
and
put
a
new
fear
within
her
--
the
fear
of
her
sin

Make
her
*NL*
dread
to
keep
the
accursed
thing
within
her
soul

Make
her
feel
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
living
God

who
beholds
all
the
past

to
whom
the
*NL*
darkness

at

eleventh
hour

her

turn
to
him

confess
her
sin

cry
for
mercy

now

before
*NL*
the
night
of
death
comes
,

the
moment
of
pardon
is
for
ever
fled

yesterday

returneth
not

*NL*
``
Saviour

I
believe
in
thy
infinite
love

What
is
my
love

*NL*
my
pleading

It
is
quenched
in
thine
.
I
can
only
clasp
her
in
my
weak
*NL*
arms
and
urge
her
with
my
weak
pity

Thou
--
thou
wilt
breathe
on

arise
from

tremble
at
nothing

at
the
sin

cuts

off
from

him

Melt
the
hard

Unseal
the
closed

soul

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinah
,
''
Hetty
sobbed
out
,
throwing
her
arms
round
Dinah
's
neck
,
``
I
will
*NL*
speak

I
will
tell

wo

any
more

*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tears
and
sobs
were
too
violent
.
Dinah
raised
her
gently
from
*NL*
her
knees
and
seated
her
on
the
pallet
again
,
sitting
down
by
her
side
.
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
convulsed
throat
was
quiet
,
and
even
*NL*
then
they
sat
some
time
in
stillness
and
darkness
,
holding
each
other
's
*NL*
hands
.
At
last
Hetty
whispered
,
``
I
did
do
it
,
Dinah
...
I
buried
it
in
the
*NL*
wood
...
the
little
baby

and
it
cried
...
I
heard
it
cry
...
ever
such
a
way
*NL*
off
...
all
night
...
and
I
went
back
because
it
cried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
then
spoke
hurriedly
in
a
louder
,
pleading
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
perhaps
it
would
n't
die
--
there
might
somebody
find
it
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
kill
it
--
I
did
n't
kill
it
myself
.
I
put
it
down
there
and
covered
*NL*
it
up
,
and
when
I
came
back
it
was
gone
...
It
was
because
I
was
so
*NL*
very
miserable
,
Dinah
...
I
did
n't
know
where
to
go
...
and
I
tried
to
kill
*NL*
myself
before
,
and
I
could
n't
.
Oh
,
I
tried
so
to
drown
myself
in
the
*NL*
pool
,
and
I
could
n't
.
I
went
to
Windsor
--
I
ran
away
--
did
you
know
?
I
*NL*
went
to
find
him
,
as
he
might
take
care
of
me
;
and
he
was
gone
;
and
then
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
dared
n't
go
back
home
again
--
I
could
n't
bear
*NL*
it
.
I
could
n't
have
bore
to
look
at
anybody
,
for
they
'd
have
scorned
me
.
*NL*
I
thought
o
'
you
sometimes
,
and
thought
I
'd
come
to
you
,
for
I
did
n't
*NL*
think
you
'd
be
cross
with
me
,
and
cry
shame
on
me
.
I
thought
I
could
*NL*
tell
you
.
But
then
the
other
folks
`
ud
come
to
know
it
at
last
,
and
I
*NL*
could
n't
bear
that
.
It
was
partly
thinking
o
'
you
made
me
come
toward
*NL*
Stoniton
;
and
,
besides
,
I
was
so
frightened
at
going
wandering
about
*NL*
till
I
was
a
beggar-woman
,
and
had
nothing
;
and
sometimes
it
seemed
as
*NL*
if
I
must
go
back
to
the
farm
sooner
than
that
.
Oh
,
it
was
so
dreadful
,
*NL*
Dinah
...
I
was
so
miserable
...
I
wished
I
'd
never
been
born
into
this
*NL*
world
.
I
should
never
like
to
go
into
the
green
fields
again
--
I
hated
*NL*
'em
so
in
my
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
paused
again
,
as
if
the
sense
of
the
past
were
too
strong
upon
her
*NL*
for
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
I
got
to
Stoniton
,
and
I
began
to
feel
frightened
that
night
,
*NL*
because
I
was
so
near
home
.
And
then
the
little
baby
was
born
,
when
I
*NL*
did
n't
expect
it
;
and
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
that
I
might
get
*NL*
rid
of
it
and
go
home
again
.
The
thought
came
all
of
a
sudden
,
as
I
was
*NL*
lying
in
the
bed
,
and
it
got
stronger
and
stronger
...
I
longed
so
to
go
*NL*
back
again
...
I
could
n't
bear
being
so
lonely
and
coming
to
beg
for
want
.
*NL*
And
it
gave
me
strength
and
resolution
to
get
up
and
dress
myself
.
I
*NL*
felt
I
must
do
it
...
I
did
n't
know
how
...
I
thought
I
'd
find
a
pool
,
if
*NL*
I
could
,
like
that
other
,
in
the
corner
of
the
field
,
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
And
when
the
woman
went
out
,
I
felt
as
if
I
was
strong
enough
to
do
*NL*
anything
...
I
thought
I
should
get
rid
of
all
my
misery
,
and
go
back
*NL*
home
,
and
never
let
'em
know
why
I
ran
away
.
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
*NL*
shawl
,
and
went
out
into
the
dark
street
,
with
the
baby
under
my
cloak
;
*NL*
and
I
walked
fast
till
I
got
into
a
street
a
good
way
off
,
and
there
*NL*
was
a
public
,
and
I
got
some
warm
stuff
to
drink
and
some
bread
.
And
*NL*
I
walked
on
and
on
,
and
I
hardly
felt
the
ground
I
trod
on
;
and
it
got
*NL*
lighter
,
for
there
came
the
moon
--
oh
,
Dinah
,
it
frightened
me
when
it
*NL*
first
looked
at
me
out
o
'
the
clouds
--
it
never
looked
so
before
;
and
*NL*
I
turned
out
of
the
road
into
the
fields
,
for
I
was
afraid
o
'
meeting
*NL*
anybody
with
the
moon
shining
on
me
.
And
I
came
to
a
haystack
,
where
*NL*
I
thought
I
could
lie
down
and
keep
myself
warm
all
night
.
There
was
a
*NL*
place
cut
into
it
,
where
I
could
make
me
a
bed
,
and
I
lay
comfortable
,
*NL*
and
the
baby
was
warm
against
me
;
and
I
must
have
gone
to
sleep
for
a
*NL*
good
while
,
for
when
I
woke
it
was
morning
,
but
not
very
light
,
and
the
*NL*
baby
was
crying
.
And
I
saw
a
wood
a
little
way
off
...
I
thought
there
'd
*NL*
perhaps
be
a
ditch
or
a
pond
there
...
and
it
was
so
early
I
thought
I
*NL*
could
hide
the
child
there
,
and
get
a
long
way
off
before
folks
was
up
.
*NL*
And
then
I
thought
I
'd
go
home
--
I
'd
get
rides
in
carts
and
go
home
and
*NL*
tell
'em
I
'd
been
to
try
and
see
for
a
place
,
and
could
n't
get
one
.
I
*NL*
longed
so
for
it
,
Dinah
,
I
longed
so
to
be
safe
at
home
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
I
felt
about
the
baby
.
I
seemed
to
hate
it
--
it
was
like
a
heavy
*NL*
weight
hanging
round
my
neck
;
and
yet
its
crying
went
through
me
,
and
I
*NL*
dared
n't
look
at
its
little
hands
and
face
.
But
I
went
on
to
the
wood
,
*NL*
and
I
walked
about
,
but
there
was
no
water
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
shuddered
.
She
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
when
she
began
*NL*
again
,
it
was
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
a
place
where
there
was
lots
of
chips
and
turf
,
and
I
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
to
think
what
I
should
do
.
And
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
I
saw
a
hole
under
the
nut-tree
,
like
a
little
grave
.
And
it
*NL*
darted
into
me
like
lightning
--
I
'd
lay
the
baby
there
and
cover
it
with
*NL*
the
grass
and
the
chips
.
I
could
n't
kill
it
any
other
way
.
And
I
'd
done
*NL*
it
in
a
minute
;
and
,
oh
,
it
cried
so
,
Dinah
--
I
could
n't
cover
it
quite
*NL*
up
--
I
thought
perhaps
somebody
`
ud
come
and
take
care
of
it
,
and
then
*NL*
it
would
n't
die
.
And
I
made
haste
out
of
the
wood
,
but
I
could
hear
it
*NL*
crying
all
the
while
;
and
when
I
got
out
into
the
fields
,
it
was
as
if
I
*NL*
was
held
fast
--
I
could
n't
go
away
,
for
all
I
wanted
so
to
go
.
And
I
sat
*NL*
against
the
haystack
to
watch
if
anybody
`
ud
come
.
I
was
very
hungry
,
*NL*
and
I
'd
only
a
bit
of
bread
left
,
but
I
could
n't
go
away
.
And
after
ever
*NL*
such
a
while
--
hours
and
hours
--
the
man
came
--
him
in
a
smock-frock
,
and
*NL*
he
looked
at
me
so
,
I
was
frightened
,
and
I
made
haste
and
went
on
.
I
*NL*
thought
he
was
going
to
the
wood
and
would
perhaps
find
the
baby
.
And
I
*NL*
went
right
on
,
till
I
came
to
a
village
,
a
long
way
off
from
the
wood
,
*NL*
and
I
was
very
sick
,
and
faint
,
and
hungry
.
I
got
something
to
eat
*NL*
there
,
and
bought
a
loaf
.
But
I
was
frightened
to
stay
.
I
heard
the
baby
*NL*
crying
,
and
thought
the
other
folks
heard
it
too
--
and
I
went
on
.
But
*NL*
I
was
so
tired
,
and
it
was
getting
towards
dark
.
And
at
last
,
by
the
*NL*
roadside
there
was
a
barn
--
ever
such
a
way
off
any
house
--
like
the
barn
*NL*
in
Abbot
's
Close
,
and
I
thought
I
could
go
in
there
and
hide
myself
*NL*
among
the
hay
and
straw
,
and
nobody
`
ud
be
likely
to
come
.
I
went
in
,
*NL*
and
it
was
half
full
o
'
trusses
of
straw
,
and
there
was
some
hay
too
.
*NL*
And
I
made
myself
a
bed
,
ever
so
far
behind
,
where
nobody
could
find
*NL*
me
;
and
I
was
so
tired
and
weak
,
I
went
to
sleep
...
But
oh
,
the
baby
's
*NL*
crying
kept
waking
me
,
and
I
thought
that
man
as
looked
at
me
so
was
*NL*
come
and
laying
hold
of
me
.
But
I
must
have
slept
a
long
while
at
last
,
*NL*
though
I
did
n't
know
,
for
when
I
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
barn
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
night
or
morning
.
But
it
was
morning
,
for
*NL*
it
kept
getting
lighter
,
and
I
turned
back
the
way
I
'd
come
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
help
it
,
Dinah
;
it
was
the
baby
's
crying
made
me
go
--
and
yet
I
was
*NL*
frightened
to
death
.
I
thought
that
man
in
the
smock-frock
`
ud
see
me
*NL*
and
know
I
put
the
baby
there
.
But
I
went
on
,
for
all
that
.
I
'd
left
off
*NL*
thinking
about
going
home
--
it
had
gone
out
o
'
my
mind
.
I
saw
nothing
*NL*
but
that
place
in
the
wood
where
I
'd
buried
the
baby
...
I
see
it
now
.
Oh
*NL*
Dinah
!
shall
I
allays
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
clung
round
Dinah
and
shuddered
again
.
The
silence
seemed
long
*NL*
before
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
nobody
,
for
it
was
very
early
,
and
I
got
into
the
wood
...
I
knew
*NL*
the
way
to
the
place
...
the
place
against
the
nut-tree
;
and
I
could
*NL*
hear
it
crying
at
every
step
...
I
thought
it
was
alive
...
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
I
was
frightened
or
glad
...
I
do
n't
know
what
I
felt
.
I
only
know
*NL*
I
was
in
the
wood
and
heard
the
cry
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
felt
till
I
saw
*NL*
the
baby
was
gone
.
And
when
I
'd
put
it
there
,
I
thought
I
should
like
*NL*
somebody
to
find
it
and
save
it
from
dying
;
but
when
I
saw
it
was
gone
,
*NL*
I
was
struck
like
a
stone
,
with
fear
.
I
never
thought
o
'
stirring
,
I
*NL*
felt
so
weak
.
I
knew
I
could
n't
run
away
,
and
everybody
as
saw
me
`
ud
*NL*
know
about
the
baby
.
My
heart
went
like
a
stone
.
I
could
n't
wish
or
try
*NL*
for
anything
;
it
seemed
like
as
if
I
should
stay
there
for
ever
,
and
*NL*
nothing
`
ud
ever
change
.
But
they
came
and
took
me
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
was
silent
,
but
she
shuddered
again
,
as
if
there
was
still
*NL*
something
behind
;
and
Dinah
waited
,
for
her
heart
was
so
full
that
tears
*NL*
must
come
before
words
.
At
last
Hetty
burst
out
,
with
a
sob
,
``
Dinah
,
do
*NL*
you
think
God
will
take
away
that
crying
and
the
place
in
the
wood
,
now
*NL*
I
've
told
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
pray
,
poor
sinner
.
Let
us
fall
on
our
knees
again
,
and
pray
to
*NL*
the
God
of
all
mercy

The
Hours
of
Suspense
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ON
Sunday
morning
,
when
the
church
bells
in
Stoniton
were
ringing
for
*NL*
morning
service
,
Bartle
Massey
re-entered
Adam
's
room
,
after
a
short
*NL*
absence
,
and
said
,
``
Adam
,
here
's
a
visitor
wants
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
seated
with
his
back
towards
the
door
,
but
he
started
up
and
*NL*
turned
round
instantly
,
with
a
flushed
face
and
an
eager
look
.
His
face
*NL*
was
even
thinner
and
more
worn
than
we
have
seen
it
before
,
but
he
was
*NL*
washed
and
shaven
this
Sunday
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
any
news
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
yourself
quiet
,
my
lad
,
''
said
Bartle
;
``
keep
quiet
.
It
's
not
what
*NL*
you
're
thinking
of
.
It
's
the
young
Methodist
woman
come
from
the
prison
.
*NL*
She
's
at
the
bottom
o
'
the
stairs
,
and
wants
to
know
if
you
think
*NL*
well
to
see
her
,
for
she
has
something
to
say
to
you
about
that
poor
*NL*
castaway
;
but
she
would
n't
come
in
without
your
leave
,
she
said
.
She
*NL*
thought
you
'd
perhaps
like
to
go
out
and
speak
to
her
.
These
preaching
*NL*
women
are
not
so
back
`
ard
commonly
,
''
Bartle
muttered
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
her
to
come
in
,
''
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
with
his
face
towards
the
door
,
and
as
Dinah
entered
,
*NL*
lifting
up
her
mild
grey
eyes
towards
him
,
she
saw
at
once
the
great
*NL*
change
that
had
come
since
the
day
when
she
had
looked
up
at
the
tall
*NL*
man
in
the
cottage
.
There
was
a
trembling
in
her
clear
voice
as
she
put
*NL*
her
hand
into
his
and
said
,
``
Be
comforted
,
Adam
Bede
,
the
Lord
has
not
*NL*
forsaken
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
for
coming
to
her
,
''
Adam
said
.
``
Mr.
Massey
brought
me
word
*NL*
yesterday
as
you
was
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
neither
of
them
say
any
more
just
yet
,
but
stood
before
each
*NL*
other
in
silence
;
and
Bartle
Massey
,
too
,
who
had
put
on
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
seemed
transfixed
,
examining
Dinah
's
face
.
But
he
recovered
himself
*NL*
first
,
and
said
,
``
Sit
down
,
young
woman
,
sit
down
,
''
placing
the
chair
*NL*
for
her
and
retiring
to
his
old
seat
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
friend
;
I
wo
n't
sit
down
,
''
said
Dinah
,
``
for
I
must
hasten
*NL*
back
.
She
entreated
me
not
to
stay
long
away
.
What
I
came
for
,
Adam
*NL*
Bede
,
was
to
pray
you
to
go
and
see
the
poor
sinner
and
bid
her
*NL*
farewell
.
She
desires
to
ask
your
forgiveness
,
and
it
is
meet
you
should
*NL*
see
her
to-day
,
rather
than
in
the
early
morning
,
when
the
time
will
be
*NL*
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
stood
trembling
,
and
at
last
sank
down
on
his
chair
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
'll
be
put
off
--
there
'll
perhaps
come
a
*NL*
pardon
.
Mr.
Irwine
said
there
was
hope
.
He
said
,
I
need
n't
quite
give
it
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
blessed
thought
to
me
,
''
said
Dinah
,
her
eyes
filling
with
*NL*
tears
.
``
It
's
a
fearful
thing
hurrying
her
soul
away
so
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
what
will
be
,
''
she
added
presently
.
``
You
will
surely
come
,
and
*NL*
let
her
speak
the
words
that
are
in
her
heart
.
Although
her
poor
soul
is
*NL*
very
dark
and
discerns
little
beyond
the
things
of
the
flesh
,
she
is
no
*NL*
longer
hard
.
She
is
contrite
,
she
has
confessed
all
to
me
.
The
pride
of
*NL*
her
heart
has
given
way
,
and
she
leans
on
me
for
help
and
desires
to
*NL*
be
taught
.
This
fills
me
with
trust
,
for
I
can
not
but
think
that
the
*NL*
brethren
sometimes
err
in
measuring
the
Divine
love
by
the
sinner
's
*NL*
knowledge
.
She
is
going
to
write
a
letter
to
the
friends
at
the
Hall
*NL*
Farm
for
me
to
give
them
when
she
is
gone
,
and
when
I
told
her
you
were
*NL*
here
,
she
said
,
'
I
should
like
to
say
good-bye
to
Adam
and
ask
him
to
*NL*
forgive
me
.
'
You
will
come
,
Adam
?
Perhaps
you
will
even
now
come
back
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
,
''
Adam
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
good-bye
while
there
's
any
hope
.
I
'm
*NL*
listening
,
and
listening
--
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
nothing
but
that
.
It
ca
n't
be
*NL*
as
she
'll
die
that
shameful
death
--
I
ca
n't
bring
my
mind
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
from
his
chair
again
and
looked
away
out
of
the
window
,
while
*NL*
Dinah
stood
with
compassionate
patience
.
In
a
minute
or
two
he
turned
*NL*
round
and
said
,
``
I
will
come
,
Dinah...to-morrow
morning
...
if
it
must
be
.
*NL*
I
may
have
more
strength
to
bear
it
,
if
I
know
it
must
be
.
Tell
her
,
I
*NL*
forgive
her
;
tell
her
I
will
come
--
at
the
very
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
urge
you
against
the
voice
of
your
own
heart
,
''
said
Dinah
.
*NL*
``
I
must
hasten
back
to
her
,
for
it
is
wonderful
how
she
clings
now
,
and
*NL*
was
not
willing
to
let
me
out
of
her
sight
.
She
used
never
to
make
any
*NL*
return
to
my
affection
before
,
but
now
tribulation
has
opened
her
heart
.
*NL*
Farewell
,
Adam
.
Our
heavenly
Father
comfort
you
and
strengthen
you
*NL*
to
bear
all
things
.
''
Dinah
put
out
her
hand
,
and
Adam
pressed
it
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
Massey
was
getting
up
to
lift
the
stiff
latch
of
the
door
for
*NL*
her
,
but
before
he
could
reach
it
,
she
had
said
gently
,
``
Farewell
,
*NL*
friend
,
''
and
was
gone
,
with
her
light
step
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Bartle
,
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
putting
them
into
his
*NL*
pocket
,
``
if
there
must
be
women
to
make
trouble
in
the
world
,
it
's
*NL*
but
fair
there
should
be
women
to
be
comforters
under
it
;
and
she
's
*NL*
one
--
she
's
one
.
It
's
a
pity
she
's
a
Methodist
;
but
there
's
no
getting
a
*NL*
woman
without
some
foolishness
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
never
went
to
bed
that
night
.
The
excitement
of
suspense
,
*NL*
heightening
with
every
hour
that
brought
him
nearer
the
fatal
moment
,
*NL*
was
too
great
,
and
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
,
in
spite
of
his
promises
*NL*
that
he
would
be
perfectly
quiet
,
the
schoolmaster
watched
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
matter
to
me
,
lad
?
''
Bartle
said
:
``
a
night
's
sleep
more
*NL*
or
less
?
I
shall
sleep
long
enough
,
by
and
by
,
underground
.
Let
me
keep
*NL*
thee
company
in
trouble
while
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
and
dreary
night
in
that
small
chamber
.
Adam
would
*NL*
sometimes
get
up
and
tread
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
short
space
*NL*
from
wall
to
wall
;
then
he
would
sit
down
and
hide
his
face
,
and
no
*NL*
sound
would
be
heard
but
the
ticking
of
the
watch
on
the
table
,
or
*NL*
the
falling
of
a
cinder
from
the
fire
which
the
schoolmaster
carefully
*NL*
tended
.
Sometimes
he
would
burst
out
into
vehement
speech
,
``
If
I
could
*NL*
ha
'
done
anything
to
save
her
--
if
my
bearing
anything
would
ha
'
done
any
*NL*
good
...
but
t
'
have
to
sit
still
,
and
know
it
,
and
do
nothing
...
it
's
*NL*
hard
for
a
man
to
bear
...
and
to
think
o
'
what
might
ha
'
been
now
,
if
*NL*
it
had
n't
been
for
HIM
...
O
God
,
it
's
the
very
day
we
should
ha
'
been
*NL*
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
my
lad
,
''
said
Bartle
tenderly
,
``
it
's
heavy
--
it
's
heavy
.
But
you
*NL*
must
remember
this
:
when
you
thought
of
marrying
her
,
you
'd
a
notion
*NL*
she
'd
got
another
sort
of
a
nature
inside
her
.
You
did
n't
think
she
*NL*
could
have
got
hardened
in
that
little
while
to
do
what
she
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
--
I
know
that
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
I
thought
she
was
loving
and
*NL*
tender-hearted
,
and
would
n't
tell
a
lie
,
or
act
deceitful
.
How
could
I
*NL*
think
any
other
way
?
And
if
he
'd
never
come
near
her
,
and
I
'd
married
*NL*
her
,
and
been
loving
to
her
,
and
took
care
of
her
,
she
might
never
*NL*
ha
'
done
anything
bad
.
What
would
it
ha
'
signified
--
my
having
a
bit
o
'
*NL*
trouble
with
her
?
It
`
ud
ha
'
been
nothing
to
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
knowing
,
my
lad
--
there
's
no
knowing
what
might
have
come
.
*NL*
The
smart
's
bad
for
you
to
bear
now
:
you
must
have
time
--
you
must
have
*NL*
time
.
But
I
've
that
opinion
of
you
,
that
you
'll
rise
above
it
all
and
be
*NL*
a
man
again
,
and
there
may
good
come
out
of
this
that
we
do
n't
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
come
out
of
it
!
''
said
Adam
passionately
.
``
That
does
n't
alter
th
'
*NL*
evil
:
HER
ruin
ca
n't
be
undone
.
I
hate
that
talk
o
'
people
,
as
if
there
*NL*
was
a
way
o
'
making
amends
for
everything
.
They
'd
more
need
be
brought
*NL*
to
see
as
the
wrong
they
do
can
never
be
altered
.
When
a
man
's
spoiled
*NL*
his
fellow-creatur
's
life
,
he
's
no
right
to
comfort
himself
with
*NL*
thinking
good
may
come
out
of
it
.
Somebody
else
's
good
does
n't
alter
her
*NL*
shame
and
misery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
lad
,
well
,
''
said
Bartle
,
in
a
gentle
tone
,
strangely
in
contrast
*NL*
with
his
usual
peremptoriness
and
impatience
of
contradiction
,
``
it
's
*NL*
likely
enough
I
talk
foolishness
.
I
'm
an
old
fellow
,
and
it
's
a
good
*NL*
many
years
since
I
was
in
trouble
myself
.
It
's
easy
finding
reasons
why
*NL*
other
folks
should
be
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Massey
,
''
said
Adam
penitently
,
``
I
'm
very
hot
and
hasty
.
I
owe
you
*NL*
something
different

but
you
must
n't
take
it
ill
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
lad
--
not
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
night
wore
on
in
agitation
till
the
chill
dawn
and
the
growing
*NL*
light
brought
the
tremulous
quiet
that
comes
on
the
brink
of
despair
.
*NL*
There
would
soon
be
no
more
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
the
prison
now
,
Mr.
Massey
,
''
said
Adam
,
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
hand
of
his
watch
at
six
.
``
If
there
's
any
news
come
,
we
shall
hear
about
*NL*
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
were
astir
already
,
moving
rapidly
,
in
one
direction
,
through
*NL*
the
streets
.
Adam
tried
not
to
think
where
they
were
going
,
as
they
*NL*
hurried
past
him
in
that
short
space
between
his
lodging
and
the
prison
*NL*
gates
.
He
was
thankful
when
the
gates
shut
him
in
from
seeing
those
*NL*
eager
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
;
there
was
no
news
come
--
no
pardon
--
no
reprieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
lingered
in
the
court
half
an
hour
before
he
could
bring
himself
*NL*
to
send
word
to
Dinah
that
he
was
come
.
But
a
voice
caught
his
ear
:
he
*NL*
could
not
shut
out
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cart
is
to
set
off
at
half-past
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
said
--
the
last
good-bye
:
there
was
no
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
from
that
time
,
Adam
was
at
the
door
of
the
cell
.
Dinah
*NL*
had
sent
him
word
that
she
could
not
come
to
him
;
she
could
not
leave
*NL*
Hetty
one
moment
;
but
Hetty
was
prepared
for
the
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
see
her
when
he
entered
,
for
agitation
deadened
his
senses
,
*NL*
and
the
dim
cell
was
almost
dark
to
him
.
He
stood
a
moment
after
the
*NL*
door
closed
behind
him
,
trembling
and
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
began
to
see
through
the
dimness
--
to
see
the
dark
eyes
lifted
up
*NL*
to
him
once
more
,
but
with
no
smile
in
them
.
O
God
,
how
sad
they
looked
!
*NL*
The
last
time
they
had
met
his
was
when
he
parted
from
her
with
his
*NL*
heart
full
of
joyous
hopeful
love
,
and
they
looked
out
with
a
tearful
*NL*
smile
from
a
pink
,
dimpled
,
childish
face
.
The
face
was
marble
now
;
the
*NL*
sweet
lips
were
pallid
and
half-open
and
quivering
;
the
dimples
were
all
*NL*
gone
--
all
but
one
,
that
never
went
;
and
the
eyes
--
O
,
the
worst
of
all
*NL*
was
the
likeness
they
had
to
Hetty
's
.
They
were
Hetty
's
eyes
looking
*NL*
at
him
with
that
mournful
gaze
,
as
if
she
had
come
back
to
him
from
the
*NL*
dead
to
tell
him
of
her
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
clinging
close
to
Dinah
;
her
cheek
was
against
Dinah
's
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
if
her
last
faint
strength
and
hope
lay
in
that
contact
,
and
*NL*
the
pitying
love
that
shone
out
from
Dinah
's
face
looked
like
a
visible
*NL*
pledge
of
the
Invisible
Mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sad
eyes
met
--
when
Hetty
and
Adam
looked
at
each
other
--
she
*NL*
felt
the
change
in
him
too
,
and
it
seemed
to
strike
her
with
fresh
*NL*
fear
.
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
any
being
whose
face
seemed
to
*NL*
reflect
the
change
in
herself
:
Adam
was
a
new
image
of
the
dreadful
past
*NL*
and
the
dreadful
present
.
She
trembled
more
as
she
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
him
,
Hetty
,
''
Dinah
said
;
``
tell
him
what
is
in
your
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
obeyed
her
,
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
...
I
'm
very
sorry
...
I
behaved
very
wrong
to
you
...
will
you
forgive
*NL*
me
...
before
I
die
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
answered
with
a
half-sob
,
``
Yes
,
I
forgive
thee
Hetty
.
I
forgave
*NL*
thee
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
seemed
to
Adam
as
if
his
brain
would
burst
with
the
anguish
of
*NL*
meeting
Hetty
's
eyes
in
the
first
moments
,
but
the
sound
of
her
voice
*NL*
uttering
these
penitent
words
touched
a
chord
which
had
been
less
*NL*
strained
.
There
was
a
sense
of
relief
from
what
was
becoming
unbearable
,
*NL*
and
the
rare
tears
came
--
they
had
never
come
before
,
since
he
had
hung
*NL*
on
Seth
's
neck
in
the
beginning
of
his
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hetty
made
an
involuntary
movement
towards
him
,
some
of
the
love
that
*NL*
she
had
once
lived
in
the
midst
of
was
come
near
her
again
.
She
kept
*NL*
hold
of
Dinah
's
hand
,
but
she
went
up
to
Adam
and
said
timidly
,
``
Will
*NL*
you
kiss
me
again
,
Adam
,
for
all
I
've
been
so
wicked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
took
the
blanched
wasted
hand
she
put
out
to
him
,
and
they
gave
*NL*
each
other
the
solemn
unspeakable
kiss
of
a
lifelong
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
tell
him
,
''
Hetty
said
,
in
rather
a
stronger
voice
,
``
tell
him
...
for
*NL*
there
's
nobody
else
to
tell
him
...
as
I
went
after
him
and
could
n't
find
*NL*
him
...
and
I
hated
him
and
cursed
him
once
...
but
Dinah
says
I
should
*NL*
forgive
him
...
and
I
try
...
for
else
God
wo
n't
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
noise
at
the
door
of
the
cell
now
--
the
key
was
being
turned
*NL*
in
the
lock
,
and
when
the
door
opened
,
Adam
saw
indistinctly
that
there
*NL*
were
several
faces
there
.
He
was
too
agitated
to
see
more
--
even
to
*NL*
see
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
was
one
of
them
.
He
felt
that
the
last
*NL*
preparations
were
beginning
,
and
he
could
stay
no
longer
.
Room
*NL*
was
silently
made
for
him
to
depart
,
and
he
went
to
his
chamber
in
*NL*
loneliness
,
leaving
Bartle
Massey
to
watch
and
see
the
end
.

The
Last
Moment
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
sight
that
some
people
remembered
better
even
than
their
own
*NL*
sorrows
--
the
sight
in
that
grey
clear
morning
,
when
the
fatal
cart
*NL*
with
the
two
young
women
in
it
was
descried
by
the
waiting
watching
*NL*
multitude
,
cleaving
its
way
towards
the
hideous
symbol
of
a
deliberately
*NL*
inflicted
sudden
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Stoniton
had
heard
of
Dinah
Morris
,
the
young
Methodist
woman
who
*NL*
had
brought
the
obstinate
criminal
to
confess
,
and
there
was
as
much
*NL*
eagerness
to
see
her
as
to
see
the
wretched
Hetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dinah
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
multitude
.
When
Hetty
had
*NL*
caught
sight
of
the
vast
crowd
in
the
distance
,
she
had
clutched
Dinah
*NL*
convulsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
your
eyes
,
Hetty
,
''
Dinah
said
,
``
and
let
us
pray
without
ceasing
*NL*
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
low
voice
,
as
the
cart
went
slowly
along
through
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
gazing
crowd
,
she
poured
forth
her
soul
with
the
wrestling
intensity
*NL*
of
a
last
pleading
,
for
the
trembling
creature
that
clung
to
her
and
*NL*
clutched
her
as
the
only
visible
sign
of
love
and
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
did
not
know
that
the
crowd
was
silent
,
gazing
at
her
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
awe
--
she
did
not
even
know
how
near
they
were
to
the
fatal
spot
,
when
*NL*
the
cart
stopped
,
and
she
shrank
appalled
at
a
loud
shout
hideous
to
her
*NL*
ear
,
like
a
vast
yell
of
demons
.
Hetty
's
shriek
mingled
with
the
sound
,
*NL*
and
they
clasped
each
other
in
mutual
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
a
shout
of
execration
--
not
a
yell
of
exultant
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
shout
of
sudden
excitement
at
the
appearance
of
a
horseman
*NL*
cleaving
the
crowd
at
full
gallop
.
The
horse
is
hot
and
distressed
,
but
*NL*
answers
to
the
desperate
spurring
;
the
rider
looks
as
if
his
eyes
were
*NL*
glazed
by
madness
,
and
he
saw
nothing
but
what
was
unseen
by
others
.
*NL*
See
,
he
has
something
in
his
hand
--
he
is
holding
it
up
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
signal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sheriff
knows
him
:
it
is
Arthur
Donnithorne

carrying
in
his
hand
a

hard-won
release
from
death

Another
Meeting
in
the
Wood
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
day
,
at
evening
,
two
men
were
walking
from
opposite
points
*NL*
towards
the
same
scene
,
drawn
thither
by
a
common
memory
.
The
scene
was
*NL*
the
Grove
by
Donnithorne
Chase
:
you
know
who
the
men
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
squire
's
funeral
had
taken
place
that
morning
,
the
will
had
been
*NL*
read
,
and
now
in
the
first
breathing-space
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
had
come
*NL*
out
for
a
lonely
walk
,
that
he
might
look
fixedly
at
the
new
future
*NL*
before
him
and
confirm
himself
in
a
sad
resolution
.
He
thought
he
could
*NL*
do
that
best
in
the
Grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
too
had
come
from
Stontion
on
Monday
evening
,
and
to-day
he
had
*NL*
not
left
home
,
except
to
go
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
*NL*
them
everything
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
left
untold
.
He
had
agreed
with
the
*NL*
Poysers
that
he
would
follow
them
to
their
new
neighbourhood
,
wherever
*NL*
that
might
be
,
for
he
meant
to
give
up
the
management
of
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
,
as
soon
as
it
was
practicable
,
he
would
wind
up
his
business
with
*NL*
Jonathan
Burge
and
settle
with
his
mother
and
Seth
in
a
home
within
*NL*
reach
of
the
friends
to
whom
he
felt
bound
by
a
mutual
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seth
and
me
are
sure
to
find
work
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
man
that
's
got
our
*NL*
trade
at
his
finger-ends
is
at
home
everywhere
;
and
we
must
make
a
new
*NL*
start
.
My
mother
wo
n't
stand
in
the
way
,
for
she
's
told
me
,
since
I
came
*NL*
home
,
she
'd
made
up
her
mind
to
being
buried
in
another
parish
,
if
I
*NL*
wished
it
,
and
if
I
'd
be
more
comfortable
elsewhere
.
It
's
wonderful
*NL*
how
quiet
she
's
been
ever
since
I
came
back
.
It
seems
as
if
the
very
*NL*
greatness
o
'
the
trouble
had
quieted
and
calmed
her
.
We
shall
all
be
*NL*
better
in
a
new
country
,
though
there
's
some
I
shall
be
loath
to
leave
*NL*
behind
.
But
I
wo
n't
part
from
you
and
yours
,
if
I
can
help
it

Mr.
*NL*
Poyser

Trouble
's
made
us
kin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

lad
,
''
said
Martin
.
``
We
'll
go
out
o
'
hearing
o
'
that
man
's
name
.
*NL*
But
I
doubt
we
shall
ne'er
go
far
enough
for
folks
not
to
find
out
as
*NL*
we
've
got
them
belonging
to
us
as
are
transported
o'er
the
seas
,
and
*NL*
were
like
to
be
hanged
.
We
shall
have
that
flyin
'
up
in
our
faces
,
and
*NL*
our
children
's
after
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
long
visit
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
drew
too
strongly
on
Adam
's
*NL*
energies
for
him
to
think
of
seeing
others
,
or
re-entering
on
his
old
*NL*
occupations
till
the
morrow
.
``
But
to-morrow
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
'll
*NL*
go
to
work
again
.
I
shall
learn
to
like
it
again
some
time
,
maybe
;
and
*NL*
it
's
right
whether
I
like
it
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
was
the
last
he
would
allow
to
be
absorbed
by
sorrow
:
*NL*
suspense
was
gone
now
,
and
he
must
bear
the
unalterable
.
He
was
resolved
*NL*
not
to
see
Arthur
Donnithorne
again
,
if
it
were
possible
to
avoid
him
.
*NL*
He
had
no
message
to
deliver
from
Hetty
now
,
for
Hetty
had
seen
Arthur
.
*NL*
And
Adam
distrusted
himself
--
he
had
learned
to
dread
the
violence
of
his
*NL*
own
feeling
.
That
word
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
--
that
he
must
remember
what
he
*NL*
had
felt
after
giving
the
last
blow
to
Arthur
in
the
Grove
--
had
remained
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
about
Arthur
,
like
all
thoughts
that
are
charged
with
*NL*
strong
feeling
,
were
continually
recurring
,
and
they
always
called
up
*NL*
the
image
of
the
Grove
--
of
that
spot
under
the
overarching
boughs
where
*NL*
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
two
bending
figures
,
and
had
been
possessed
*NL*
by
sudden
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
see
it
again
to-night
for
the
last
time
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
'll
*NL*
do
me
good
;
it
'll
make
me
feel
over
again
what
I
felt
when
I
'd
knocked
*NL*
him
down
.
I
felt
what
poor
empty
work
it
was
,
as
soon
as
I
'd
done
it
,
*NL*
before
I
began
to
think
he
might
be
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
it
happened
that
Arthur
and
Adam
were
walking
towards
the
*NL*
same
spot
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
on
his
working-dress
again
,
now
,
for
he
had
thrown
off
the
*NL*
other
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
soon
as
he
came
home
;
and
if
he
had
had
*NL*
the
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
he
might
have
been
taken
,
with
*NL*
his
pale
wasted
face
,
for
the
spectre
of
the
Adam
Bede
who
entered
the
*NL*
Grove
on
that
August
evening
eight
months
ago
.
But
he
had
no
basket
of
*NL*
tools
,
and
he
was
not
walking
with
the
old
erectness
,
looking
keenly
*NL*
round
him
;
his
hands
were
thrust
in
his
side
pockets
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
rested
chiefly
on
the
ground
.
He
had
not
long
entered
the
Grove
,
and
now
*NL*
he
paused
before
a
beech
.
He
knew
that
tree
well
;
it
was
the
boundary
*NL*
mark
of
his
youth
--
the
sign
,
to
him
,
of
the
time
when
some
of
his
*NL*
earliest
,
strongest
feelings
had
left
him
.
He
felt
sure
they
would
never
*NL*
return
.
And
yet
,
at
this
moment
,
there
was
a
stirring
of
affection
*NL*
at
the
remembrance
of
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
whom
he
had
believed
in
*NL*
before
he
had
come
up
to
this
beech
eight
months
ago
.
It
was
affection
*NL*
for
the
dead
:
THAT
Arthur
existed
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
,
but
the
beech
*NL*
stood
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
he
could
not
see
who
was
coming
*NL*
until
the
tall
slim
figure
in
deep
mourning
suddenly
stood
before
him
at
*NL*
only
two
yards
'
distance
.
They
both
started
,
and
looked
at
each
other
*NL*
in
silence
.
Often
,
in
the
last
fortnight
,
Adam
had
imagined
himself
*NL*
as
close
to
Arthur
as
this
,
assailing
him
with
words
that
should
be
as
*NL*
harrowing
as
the
voice
of
remorse
,
forcing
upon
him
a
just
share
in
the
*NL*
misery
he
had
caused
;
and
often
,
too
,
he
had
told
himself
that
such
a
*NL*
meeting
had
better
not
be
.
But
in
imagining
the
meeting
he
had
always
*NL*
seen
Arthur
,
as
he
had
met
him
on
that
evening
in
the
Grove
,
florid
,
*NL*
careless
,
light
of
speech
;
and
the
figure
before
him
touched
him
with
*NL*
the
signs
of
suffering
.
Adam
knew
what
suffering
was
--
he
could
not
lay
*NL*
a
cruel
finger
on
a
bruised
man
.
He
felt
no
impulse
that
he
needed
to
*NL*
resist
.
Silence
was
more
just
than
reproach
.
Arthur
was
the
first
to
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
''
he
said
,
quietly
,
``
it
may
be
a
good
thing
that
we
have
met
here
,
*NL*
for
I
wished
to
see
you
.
I
should
have
asked
to
see
you
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
but
Adam
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
is
painful
to
you
to
meet
me
,
''
Arthur
went
on
,
``
but
it
is
not
*NL*
likely
to
happen
again
for
years
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
coldly
,
``
that
was
what
I
meant
to
write
to
you
*NL*
to-morrow
,
as
it
would
be
better
all
dealings
should
be
at
an
end
*NL*
between
us
,
and
somebody
else
put
in
my
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
felt
the
answer
keenly
,
and
it
was
not
without
an
effort
that
he
*NL*
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
partly
on
that
subject
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
lessen
your
indignation
against
me
,
or
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
*NL*
my
sake
.
I
only
wish
to
ask
you
if
you
will
help
me
to
lessen
the
*NL*
evil
consequences
of
the
past
,
which
is
unchangeable
.
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
consequences
to
myself
,
but
to
others
.
It
is
but
little
I
can
do
,
I
*NL*
know
.
I
know
the
worst
consequences
will
remain
;
but
something
may
be
*NL*
done
,
and
you
can
help
me
.
Will
you
listen
to
me
patiently
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
after
some
hesitation
;
``
I
'll
hear
what
it
is
.
If
*NL*
I
can
help
to
mend
anything
,
I
will
.
Anger
`
ull
mend
nothing
,
I
know
.
*NL*
We
've
had
enough
o
'
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
the
Hermitage
,
''
said
Arthur
.
``
Will
you
go
there
with
me
*NL*
and
sit
down
?
We
can
talk
better
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Hermitage
had
never
been
entered
since
they
left
it
together
,
for
*NL*
Arthur
had
locked
up
the
key
in
his
desk
.
And
now
,
when
he
opened
the
*NL*
door
,
there
was
the
candle
burnt
out
in
the
socket
;
there
was
the
*NL*
chair
in
the
same
place
where
Adam
remembered
sitting
;
there
was
the
*NL*
waste-paper
basket
full
of
scraps
,
and
deep
down
in
it
,
Arthur
felt
in
*NL*
an
instant
,
there
was
the
little
pink
silk
handkerchief
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
painful
to
enter
this
place
if
their
previous
thoughts
had
been
*NL*
less
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
opposite
each
other
in
the
old
places
,
and
Arthur
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
away
,
Adam
;
I
'm
going
into
the
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Arthur
felt
that
Adam
ought
to
be
affected
by
this
*NL*
announcement
--
ought
to
have
a
movement
of
sympathy
towards
him
.
But
*NL*
Adam
's
lips
remained
firmly
closed
,
and
the
expression
of
his
face
*NL*
unchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
''
Arthur
continued
,
``
is
this
:
one
of
my
*NL*
reasons
for
going
away
is
that
no
one
else
may
leave
Hayslope
--
may
leave
*NL*
their
home
on
my
account
.
I
would
do
anything
,
there
is
no
sacrifice
*NL*
I
would
not
make
,
to
prevent
any
further
injury
to
others
through
*NL*
my
--
through
what
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
words
had
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
that
he
had
*NL*
anticipated
.
Adam
thought
he
perceived
in
them
that
notion
of
*NL*
compensation
for
irretrievable
wrong
,
that
self-soothing
attempt
to
*NL*
make
evil
bear
the
same
fruits
as
good
,
which
most
of
all
roused
his
*NL*
indignation
.
He
was
as
strongly
impelled
to
look
painful
facts
right
in
*NL*
the
face
as
Arthur
was
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
them
.
Moreover
,
he
*NL*
had
the
wakeful
suspicious
pride
of
a
poor
man
in
the
presence
of
a
rich
*NL*
man
.
He
felt
his
old
severity
returning
as
he
said
,
``
The
time
's
past
for
*NL*
that
,
sir
.
A
man
should
make
sacrifices
to
keep
clear
of
doing
a
wrong
;
*NL*
sacrifices
wo
n't
undo
it
when
it
's
done
.
When
people
's
feelings
have
got
*NL*
a
deadly
wound
,
they
ca
n't
be
cured
with
favours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Favours
!
''
said
Arthur
,
passionately
;
``
no
;
how
can
you
suppose
I
meant
*NL*
that
?
But
the
Poysers
--
Mr.
Irwine
tells
me
the
Poysers
mean
to
leave
the
*NL*
place
where
they
have
lived
so
many
years
--
for
generations
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
see
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
does
,
that
if
they
could
be
persuaded
to
overcome
the
*NL*
feeling
that
drives
them
away
,
it
would
be
much
better
for
them
in
the
*NL*
end
to
remain
on
the
old
spot
,
among
the
friends
and
neighbours
who
know
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Adam
coldly
.
``
But
then
,
sir
,
folks
's
feelings
are
*NL*
not
so
easily
overcome
.
It
'll
be
hard
for
Martin
Poyser
to
go
to
a
*NL*
strange
place
,
among
strange
faces
,
when
he
's
been
bred
up
on
the
Hall
*NL*
Farm
,
and
his
father
before
him
;
but
then
it
`
ud
be
harder
for
a
man
*NL*
with
his
feelings
to
stay
.
I
do
n't
see
how
the
thing
's
to
be
made
any
*NL*
other
than
hard
.
There
's
a
sort
o
'
damage
,
sir
,
that
ca
n't
be
made
up
*NL*
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
silent
some
moments
.
In
spite
of
other
feelings
dominant
in
*NL*
him
this
evening
,
his
pride
winced
under
Adam
's
mode
of
treating
him
.
*NL*
Was
n't
he
himself
suffering
?
Was
not
he
too
obliged
to
renounce
his
most
*NL*
cherished
hopes
?
It
was
now
as
it
had
been
eight
months
ago
--
Adam
was
*NL*
forcing
Arthur
to
feel
more
intensely
the
irrevocableness
of
his
own
*NL*
wrong-doing
.
He
was
presenting
the
sort
of
resistance
that
was
the
most
*NL*
irritating
to
Arthur
's
eager
ardent
nature
.
But
his
anger
was
subdued
*NL*
by
the
same
influence
that
had
subdued
Adam
's
when
they
first
confronted
*NL*
each
other
--
by
the
marks
of
suffering
in
a
long
familiar
face
.
The
*NL*
momentary
struggle
ended
in
the
feeling
that
he
could
bear
a
great
deal
*NL*
from
Adam
,
to
whom
he
had
been
the
occasion
of
bearing
so
much
;
but
*NL*
there
was
a
touch
of
pleading
,
boyish
vexation
in
his
tone
as
he
said
,
*NL*
``
But
people
may
make
injuries
worse
by
unreasonable
conduct
--
by
giving
*NL*
way
to
anger
and
satisfying
that
for
the
moment
,
instead
of
thinking
*NL*
what
will
be
the
effect
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
going
to
stay
here
and
act
as
landlord
,
''
he
added
presently
,
*NL*
with
still
more
eagerness
--
``
if
I
were
careless
about
what
I
've
*NL*
done
--
what
I
've
been
the
cause
of
,
you
would
have
some
excuse
,
Adam
,
for
*NL*
going
away
and
encouraging
others
to
go
.
You
would
have
some
excuse
then
*NL*
for
trying
to
make
the
evil
worse
.
But
when
I
tell
you
I
'm
going
away
*NL*
for
years
--
when
you
know
what
that
means
for
me
,
how
it
cuts
off
every
*NL*
plan
of
happiness
I
've
ever
formed
--
it
is
impossible
for
a
sensible
*NL*
man
like
you
to
believe
that
there
is
any
real
ground
for
the
Poysers
*NL*
refusing
to
remain
.
I
know
their
feeling
about
disgrace
--
Mr.
Irwine
has
*NL*
told
me
all
;
but
he
is
of
opinion
that
they
might
be
persuaded
out
of
*NL*
this
idea
that
they
are
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
their
neighbours
,
*NL*
and
that
they
ca
n't
remain
on
my
estate
,
if
you
would
join
him
in
his
*NL*
efforts
--
if
you
would
stay
yourself
and
go
on
managing
the
old
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
,
pleadingly
,
``
You
know
that
's
a
*NL*
good
work
to
do
for
the
sake
of
other
people
,
besides
the
owner
.
And
*NL*
you
do
n't
know
but
that
they
may
have
a
better
owner
soon
,
whom
you
will
*NL*
like
to
work
for
.
If
I
die
,
my
cousin
Tradgett
will
have
the
estate
and
*NL*
take
my
name
.
He
is
a
good
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
could
not
help
being
moved
:
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
feel
*NL*
that
this
was
the
voice
of
the
honest
warm-hearted
Arthur
whom
he
had
*NL*
loved
and
been
proud
of
in
old
days
;
but
nearer
memories
would
not
be
*NL*
thrust
away
.
He
was
silent
;
yet
Arthur
saw
an
answer
in
his
face
that
*NL*
induced
him
to
go
on
,
with
growing
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
if
you
would
talk
to
the
Poysers
--
if
you
would
talk
the
*NL*
matter
over
with
Mr.
Irwine
--
he
means
to
see
you
to-morrow
--
and
then
if
*NL*
you
would
join
your
arguments
to
his
to
prevail
on
them
not
to
go
...
I
*NL*
know
,
of
course
,
that
they
would
not
accept
any
favour
from
me
--
I
mean
*NL*
nothing
of
that
kind
--
but
I
'm
sure
they
would
suffer
less
in
the
end
.
*NL*
Irwine
thinks
so
too
.
And
Mr.
Irwine
is
to
have
the
chief
authority
*NL*
on
the
estate
--
he
has
consented
to
undertake
that
.
They
will
really
be
*NL*
under
no
man
but
one
whom
they
respect
and
like

It
would
be
the
same
*NL*
with
you

Adam
,
and
it
could
be
nothing
but
a
desire
to
give
me
worse
*NL*
pain
that
could
incline
you
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
silent
again
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
with
some
*NL*
agitation
in
his
voice
,
``
I
would
n't
act
so
towards
you
,
I
know
.
If
you
*NL*
were
in
my
place
and
I
in
yours
,
I
should
try
to
help
you
to
do
the
*NL*
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
made
a
hasty
movement
on
his
chair
and
looked
on
the
ground
.
Arthur
*NL*
went
on
,
``
Perhaps
you
've
never
done
anything
you
've
had
bitterly
to
*NL*
repent
of
in
your
life
,
Adam
;
if
you
had
,
you
would
be
more
generous
.
*NL*
You
would
know
then
that
it
's
worse
for
me
than
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
rose
from
his
seat
with
the
last
words
,
and
went
to
one
of
the
*NL*
windows
,
looking
out
and
turning
his
back
on
Adam
,
as
he
continued
,
*NL*
passionately
,
``
Have
n't
I
loved
her
too
?
Did
n't
I
see
her
yesterday
?
*NL*
Sha
n't
I
carry
the
thought
of
her
about
with
me
as
much
as
you
will
?
And
*NL*
do
n't
you
think
you
would
suffer
more
if
you
'd
been
in
fault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
several
minutes
,
for
the
struggle
in
Adam
's
mind
*NL*
was
not
easily
decided
.
Facile
natures
,
whose
emotions
have
little
*NL*
permanence
,
can
hardly
understand
how
much
inward
resistance
he
overcame
*NL*
before
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
turned
towards
Arthur
.
Arthur
heard
the
*NL*
movement
,
and
turning
round
,
met
the
sad
but
softened
look
with
which
*NL*
Adam
said
,
``
It
's
true
what
you
say
,
sir
.
I
'm
hard
--
it
's
in
my
nature
.
*NL*
I
was
too
hard
with
my
father
,
for
doing
wrong
.
I
've
been
a
bit
hard
t
'
*NL*
everybody
but
her
.
I
felt
as
if
nobody
pitied
her
enough
--
her
suffering
*NL*
cut
into
me
so
;
and
when
I
thought
the
folks
at
the
farm
were
too
hard
*NL*
with
her
,
I
said
I
'd
never
be
hard
to
anybody
myself
again
.
But
feeling
*NL*
overmuch
about
her
has
perhaps
made
me
unfair
to
you
.
I
've
known
what
*NL*
it
is
in
my
life
to
repent
and
feel
it
's
too
late
.
I
felt
I
'd
been
too
*NL*
harsh
to
my
father
when
he
was
gone
from
me
--
I
feel
it
now
,
when
I
think
*NL*
of
him
.
I
've
no
right
to
be
hard
towards
them
as
have
done
wrong
and
*NL*
repent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
spoke
these
words
with
the
firm
distinctness
of
a
man
who
is
*NL*
resolved
to
leave
nothing
unsaid
that
he
is
bound
to
say
;
but
he
went
on
*NL*
with
more
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
shake
hands
with
you
once
,
sir
,
when
you
asked
me
--
but
if
*NL*
you
're
willing
to
do
it
now
,
for
all
I
refused
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
's
white
hand
was
in
Adam
's
large
grasp
in
an
instant
,
and
with
*NL*
that
action
there
was
a
strong
rush
,
on
both
sides
,
of
the
old
,
boyish
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
''
Arthur
said
,
impelled
to
full
confession
now
,
``
it
would
never
*NL*
have
happened
if
I
'd
known
you
loved
her
.
That
would
have
helped
to
save
*NL*
me
from
it
.
And
I
did
struggle
.
I
never
meant
to
injure
her
.
I
deceived
*NL*
you
afterwards
--
and
that
led
on
to
worse
;
but
I
thought
it
was
forced
*NL*
upon
me
,
I
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
I
could
do
.
And
in
that
letter
*NL*
I
told
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
were
in
any
trouble
:
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
would
not
have
done
everything
I
could
.
But
I
was
all
wrong
from
the
*NL*
very
first
,
and
horrible
wrong
has
come
of
it
.
God
knows
,
I
'd
give
my
*NL*
life
if
I
could
undo
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
again
opposite
each
other
,
and
Adam
said
,
tremulously
,
*NL*
``
How
did
she
seem
when
you
left
her
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
,
Adam
,
''
Arthur
said
;
``
I
feel
sometimes
as
if
I
should
go
*NL*
mad
with
thinking
of
her
looks
and
what
she
said
to
me
,
and
then
,
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
get
a
full
pardon
--
that
I
could
n't
save
her
from
that
wretched
*NL*
fate
of
being
transported
--
that
I
can
do
nothing
for
her
all
those
*NL*
years
;
and
she
may
die
under
it
,
and
never
know
comfort
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
said
Adam
,
for
the
first
time
feeling
his
own
pain
merged
in
*NL*
sympathy
for
Arthur
,
``
you
and
me
'll
often
be
thinking
o

the
same
thing
,
*NL*
when
we
're
a

off
one
another

I
'll
pray

I
*NL*
pray
him
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
that
sweet
woman
--
that
Dinah
Morris

Arthur
said
,
pursuing
*NL*
his
own
thoughts
and
not
knowing
what
had
been
the
sense
of
Adam
's
*NL*
words
,
``
she
says
she
shall
stay
with
her
to
the
very
last
moment

she
goes

and
the
poor
thing
clings
to
her
as
if
she
found
some
comfort
*NL*
in
her

I
could
worship
that
woman

I
do

know
what
I
should
do

were
not
there

Adam
,
you
will
see
her
when
she
comes
back

I
could
say
*NL*
nothing
to
her
yesterday
--
nothing
of
what
I
felt
towards
her
.
Tell
her
,
''
*NL*
Arthur
went
on
hurriedly
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
hide
the
emotion
with
which
*NL*
he
spoke
,
while
he
took
off
his
chain
and
watch
,
``
tell
her
I
asked
you
*NL*
to
give
her
this
in
remembrance
of
me

of
the
man

she
is
the
*NL*
one
source
of
comfort
,
when
he
thinks
of

I

she
does
n't
care
about

such
things

anything
else
I
can
give
her
for
its
own
sake

But
she
*NL*
will
use
the
watch

I
shall
like
to
think
of
her
using
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
it
to
her
,
sir
,
''
Adam
said
,
``
and
tell

your
words

told

come

people

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
persuade
the
Poysers
to
stay

Adam
?
''
said
Arthur
,
reminded
*NL*
of
the
subject
which
both
of
them
had
forgotten
in
the
first
interchange
*NL*
of
revived
friendship
.
``
You
will
stay
yourself
,
and
help
Mr.
Irwine
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
repairs
and
improvements
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
,
sir
,
that
perhaps
you
do
n't
take
account
of
,
''
said
*NL*
Adam
,
with
hesitating
gentleness
,
``
and
that
was
what
made
me
hang
back
*NL*
longer
.
You
see
,
it
's
the
same
with
both
me
and
the
Poysers
:
if
we
stay
,
*NL*
it
's
for
our
own
worldly
interest
,
and
it
looks
as
if
we
'd
put
up
with
*NL*
anything
for
the
sake
o

that
.
I
know
that
's
what
they
'll
feel
,
and
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
a
little
of
it
myself

When
folks
have
got
an
*NL*
honourable
independent
spirit
,
they
do
n't
like
to
do
anything
that
might
*NL*
make
'em
seem
base-minded

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
one
who
knows
you
will
think
that

That

not

strong

a
course

is
really
more
generous

more

unselfish
than

punished

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Adam
said

looking
at
Arthur
with
mournful
affection

*NL*
``
God
forbid

enough

'll
stay

I
'll
do
the
best
I

It

all

to
do

well

make
the

a

better
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

Adam

The
hands
were
clasped
once
more
,
and
Adam
left
the
Hermitage
,
feeling
*NL*
that
sorrow
was
more
bearable
now
hatred
was
gone

*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
door
was
closed

went
to

Chapter
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Hall
Farm
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
first
autumnal
afternoon
sunshine
of
1801
--
more
than
eighteen
months
*NL*
after
that
parting
of
Adam
and
Arthur
in
the
Hermitage
--
was
on
the
*NL*
yard
at
the
Hall
Farm
;
and
the
bull-dog
was
in
one
of
his
most
excited
*NL*
moments
,
for
it
was
that
hour
of
the
day
when
the
cows
were
being
driven
*NL*
into
the
yard
for
their
afternoon
milking
.
No
wonder
the
patient
beasts
*NL*
ran
confusedly
into
the
wrong
places
,
for
the
alarming
din
of
the
*NL*
bull-dog
was
mingled
with
more
distant
sounds
which
the
timid
feminine
*NL*
creatures
,
with
pardonable
superstition
,
imagined
also
to
have
some
*NL*
relation
to
their
own
movements
--
with
the
tremendous
crack
of
the
*NL*
waggoner
's
whip
,
the
roar
of
his
voice
,
and
the
booming
thunder
of
the
*NL*
waggon
,
as
it
left
the
rick-yard
empty
of
its
golden
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
milking
of
the
cows
was
a
sight
Mrs.
Poyser
loved
,
and
at
this
*NL*
hour
on
mild
days
she
was
usually
standing
at
the
house
door
,
with
her
*NL*
knitting
in
her
hands
,
in
quiet
contemplation
,
only
heightened
to
a
*NL*
keener
interest
when
the
vicious
yellow
cow
,
who
had
once
kicked
over
a
*NL*
pailful
of
precious
milk
,
was
about
to
undergo
the
preventive
punishment
*NL*
of
having
her
hinder-legs
strapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
,
however
,
Mrs.
Poyser
gave
but
a
divided
attention
to
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
cows
,
for
she
was
in
eager
discussion
with
Dinah
,
who
was
*NL*
stitching
Mr.
Poyser
's
shirt-collars
,
and
had
borne
patiently
to
have
*NL*
her
thread
broken
three
times
by
Totty
pulling
at
her
arm
with
a
sudden
*NL*
insistence
that
she
should
look
at
``
Baby
,
''
that
is
,
at
a
large
wooden
*NL*
doll
with
no
legs
and
a
long
skirt
,
whose
bald
head
Totty
,
seated
in
her
*NL*
small
chair
at
Dinah
's
side
,
was
caressing
and
pressing
to
her
fat
cheek
*NL*
with
much
fervour
.
Totty
is
larger
by
more
than
two
years
'
growth
than
*NL*
when
you
first
saw
her
,
and
she
has
on
a
black
frock
under
her
pinafore
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
too
has
on
a
black
gown
,
which
seems
to
heighten
the
family
*NL*
likeness
between
her
and
Dinah
.
In
other
respects
there
is
little
*NL*
outward
change
now
discernible
in
our
old
friends
,
or
in
the
pleasant
*NL*
house-place
,
bright
with
polished
oak
and
pewter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
the
like
to
you
,
Dinah
,
''
Mrs.
Poyser
was
saying
,
``
when
*NL*
you
've
once
took
anything
into
your
head
:
there
's
no
more
moving
you
*NL*
than
the
rooted
tree
.
You
may
say
what
you
like
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
that
's
religion
;
for
what
's
the
Sermon
on
the
Mount
about
,
as
you
're
so
*NL*
fond
o
'
reading
to
the
boys
,
but
doing
what
other
folks
`
ud
have
you
do
?
*NL*
But
if
it
was
anything
unreasonable
they
wanted
you
to
do
,
like
taking
*NL*
your
cloak
off
and
giving
it
to
'em
,
or
letting
'em
slap
you
i

the
*NL*
face

I
daresay
you
'd
be
ready
enough

It
's
only
when
one

have
you
*NL*
do
what
's
plain
common
sense

good
for

obstinate

th

other
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
dear
Aunt

said
Dinah
,
smiling
slightly
as
she
went
on
with
her
*NL*
work
,
``
I
'm
sure
your
wish
`

a

said
Dinah
,
looking
up
in
Mrs.

's
face
,
``
it

drawn

again

*NL*

said
Mrs.

,
returning
from
a
parenthetic
glance
*NL*
at

Do

you

*NL*
There
was
a
certain
something
in
Mrs.

's
voice
just
then
,
which
*NL*
she
did
not
wish
to
be
noticed
,
so
she
turned
round
hastily
to
look
at
*NL*
the
clock
,
and
said
:

*NL*
*NL*
Totty
trotted
off
in
her
flapping
bonnet
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
set
out
the
*NL*
bright
oak
table
and
reached
down
the
tea-cups

again

shutting

she
cut

*NL*
Mrs.

hastened
to
the
door
for
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
*NL*
darling
in
a
new
position
,
with
love
in

eyes

reproof
on

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Totty
,
looking
as
serenely
unconscious
of
remark
as
a
fat
white
puppy
,
*NL*
was
set
down
at
the
door-place
,
and
the
mother
enforced
her
reproof
with
*NL*
a
shower
of
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

said
Mrs.

making
way
for
him
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Adam
answered
,
as
he
went
up
to
Dinah
and
put
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
her
.
She
had
laid
down
her
work
and
stood
up
,
instinctively
,
as
*NL*
he
approached
her
.
A
faint
blush
died
away
from
her
pale
cheek
as
she
*NL*
put
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
up
at
him
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

said
Adam
,
apparently
*NL*
unconscious
that
he
was
holding
her
hand
all
the
while
;
``

*NL*
Adam
released
Dinah

as

ceased
speaking

was
expecting
an

answer
,

before
she
had
opened
her
lips
Mrs.

said
,

Mr.

entering
warm
and

coatless
,
with
the
two
black-eyed
boys
behind
him

still
looking

much

like

placing
a

on

seating
herself

pour
out
the

*NL*
*NL*
Tommy
,
with
true
brotherly
sympathy
,
was
amusing
himself
by
turning
*NL*
Dolly
's
skirt
over
her
bald
head
and
exhibiting
her
truncated
body
to
*NL*
the
general
scorn
--
an
indignity
which
cut
Totty
to
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

think
Dinah
's
been
a-telling

Mrs.

Poyser
continued

looking
at
her
husband

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

I

a
poor
un
at
guessing

said
Mr.
Poyser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
means
to
go
back
to
Snowfield
again
,
and
work
i

the

starve
herself

as
she
used

friends

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
did
not
readily
find
words
to
express
his
unpleasant
*NL*
astonishment
;
he
only
looked
from
his
wife
to
Dinah
,
who
had
now
seated
*NL*
herself
beside
Totty
,
as
a
bulwark
against
brotherly
playfulness
,
and
*NL*
was
busying
herself
with
the
children
's
tea
.
If
he
had
been
given
to
*NL*
making
general
reflections
,
it
would
have
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
*NL*
certainly
a
change
come
over
Dinah
,
for
she
never
used
to
change
colour
;
*NL*
but
,
as
it
was
,
he
merely
observed
that
her
face
was
flushed
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
Mr.
Poyser
thought
she
looked
the
prettier
for
it
:
it
was
*NL*
a
flush
no
deeper
than
the
petal
of
a
monthly
rose
.
Perhaps
it
came
*NL*
because
her
uncle
was
looking
at
her
so
fixedly
;
but
there
is
no
*NL*
knowing
,
for
just
then
Adam
was
saying
,
with
quiet
surprise
,
``
Why
,
I
*NL*
hoped
Dinah
was
settled
among
us
for
life

I
thought
she
'd
given
up
the
*NL*
notion
o

going
back
to
her
old
country

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thought

Yes

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
``
and
so
would
anybody

But
I

you

a

away
from

*NL*
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
still
pausing
over
his
tea-cup
.
``
It
's
like
breaking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

Uncle

''
said
Dinah
,
trying
to
be
quite
calm
.
``
When
I
first
came
,
I
*NL*
said
it
was
only
for
a
time

as
long

I
could
be
of
any
comfort
to
my
*NL*
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
an
'
who
said
you
'd
ever
left
off
being
a
comfort
to
me
?
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
.
``
If
you
didna
mean
to
stay

you

never

Them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
objected
to
exaggerated
views
.
``
Thee
*NL*
mustna
say
so
;
we
should
ha

been
ill
off
wi'out
her

*NL*
twelvemont

.
We
mun
be
thankful
for
that
,
whether
she
stays
or
no

But
*NL*
I
canna
think
what
she
mun
leave
a
good
home
for
,
to
go
back
int
'
a
*NL*
country
where
the
land
,
most
o
n't
,
isna
worth
ten
shillings
an
acre

*NL*
rent
and
profits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
just
the
reason
she
wants
to
go

as
fur
as
she
can
give
a
*NL*
reason

said
Mrs.
Poyser

``
She
says
this

to
be
so
obstinate

is
it
now

*NL*
Adam

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
saw
that
Dinah
was
more
disturbed
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
by
any
*NL*
matter
relating
to
herself
,
and
,
anxious
to
relieve
her
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
he
said
,
looking
at
her
affectionately
,
``
Nay
,
I
ca
n't
find
fault
with
*NL*
anything
Dinah
does
.
I
believe
her
thoughts
are
better
than
our
guesses
,
*NL*
let
'em
be
what
they
may
.
I
should
ha
'
been
thankful
for
her
to
stay
*NL*
among
us
,
but
if
she
thinks
well
to
go
,
I
would
n't
cross
her
,
or
make
it
*NL*
hard
to
her
by
objecting
.
We
owe
her
something
different
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
often
happens
,
the
words
intended
to
relieve
her
were
just
too
*NL*
much
for
Dinah
's
susceptible
feelings
at
this
moment
.
The
tears
came
*NL*
into
the
grey
eyes
too
fast
to
be
hidden
and
she
got
up
hurriedly
,
*NL*
meaning
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
going
to
put
on
her
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

Totty

*NL*
``

``
But
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

said
Mr.

,
looking
jocose
;
``
but
thee

about

Adam

as
the

preaching
was
the
only

says

thee
there

Mr.

added

laughing
unctuously

*NL*

doing

give

pretty

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
errand
was
devised
for
Totty
as
a
means
of
checking
certain
*NL*
threatening
symptoms
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
;
for
Tommy

*NL*
no

expectant

was
lifting
up
his

turning
his

towards
Totty
in

disagreeably
personal

*NL*

enough

now

with
only
our

I
should
like

have
my

way
about

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

man
enough

understands
farming

he
's
*NL*
carrying

and
all
that

capital
.
You
must
go
some
day
*NL*
towards
the
Stonyshire
side
and
see
what
alterations
they
're
making
.
But
*NL*
he
's
got
no
notion
about

You
can
so
seldom
get
hold
of
a
man
*NL*
as
can
turn
his
brains
to
more
nor
one

it

could

nothing

Now

there

as
for

they
set
up
to
be
fine

the

of

n't
know
where
to
set
a
chimney
so
as
it

be
quarrelling

a

My
notion
is

a
practical
builder
that
's
got
a
bit
o

taste
makes
the
best
architect
for
common

I

ten
times
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
listened
with
an
admiring
interest
to
Adam
's
discourse
on
*NL*
building
,
but
perhaps
it
suggested
to
him
that
the
building
of
his
*NL*
corn-rick
had
been
proceeding
a
little
too
long
without
the
control
of
*NL*
the
master
's
eye
,
for
when
Adam
had
done
speaking
,
he
got
up
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
lad
,
I
'll
bid
you
good-bye
now
,
for
I
'm
off
to
the
rick-yard
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
rose
too
,
for
he
saw
Dinah
entering
,
with
her
bonnet
on
and
a
*NL*
little
basket
in
her
hand
,
preceded
by
Totty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
ready
,
I
see
,
Dinah
,
''
Adam
said
;
``
so
we
'll
set
off
,
for
the
*NL*
sooner
I
'm
at
home
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
Totty
,
with
her
treble
pipe
,
``
Dinah
was
saying
her
*NL*
prayers
and
crying
ever
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
hush
,
''
said
the
mother
,
``
little
gells
must
n't
chatter

''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
the
father
,
shaking
with
silent
laughter
,
set
Totty
on
the
*NL*
white
deal
table
and
desired
her
to
kiss
him
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
,
you
*NL*
perceive
,
had
no
correct
principles
of
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
to-morrow
if
Mrs.
Bede
does
n't
want
you
,
Dinah

said
Mrs.
*NL*
Poyser
:
``
but
you
can
stay
,
you
know
,
if
she
's
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
the
good-byes
had
been
said
,
Dinah
and
Adam
left
the
Hall
Farm
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
L
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Cottage
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ADAM
did
not
ask
Dinah
to
take
his
arm
when
they
got
out
into
the
lane
.
*NL*
He
had
never
yet
done
so
,
often
as
they
had
walked
together
,
for
he
had
*NL*
observed
that
she
never
walked
arm-in-arm
with
Seth
,
and
he
thought
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
kind
of
support
was
not
agreeable
to
her
.
So
they
walked
*NL*
apart
,
though
side
by
side
,
and
the
close
poke
of
her
little
black
*NL*
bonnet
hid
her
face
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
be
happy
,
then
,
to
make
the
Hall
Farm
your
home
,
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
Adam
said
,
with
the
quiet
interest
of
a
brother
,
who
has
no
anxiety
for
*NL*
himself
in
the
matter
.
``
It
's
a
pity
,
seeing
they
're
so
fond
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Adam
,
my
heart
is
as
their
heart
,
so
far
as
love
for
them
*NL*
and
care
for
their
welfare
goes
,
but
they
are
in
no
present
need
.
Their
*NL*
sorrows
are
healed
,
and
I
feel
that
I
am
called
back
to
my
old
work
,
in
*NL*
which
I
found
a
blessing
that
I
have
missed
of
late
in
the
midst
of
too
*NL*
abundant
worldly
good
.
I
know
it
is
a
vain
thought
to
flee
from
the
work
*NL*
that
God
appoints
us
,
for
the
sake
of
finding
a
greater
blessing
to
our
*NL*
own
souls
,
as
if
we
could
choose
for
ourselves
where
we
shall
find
the
*NL*
fulness
of
the
Divine
Presence
,
instead
of
seeking
it
where
alone
it
*NL*
is
to
be
found
,
in
loving
obedience
.
But
now
,
I
believe
,
I
have
a
clear
*NL*
showing
that
my
work
lies
elsewhere
--
at
least
for
a
time
.
In
the
years
*NL*
to
come
,
if
my
aunt
's
health
should
fail
,
or
she
should
otherwise
need
*NL*
me
,
I
shall
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
,
Dinah

''
said
Adam
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
'd
go
against
the
*NL*
wishes
of
them
that
love
you

and
are
akin
to
you
,
without
a
good
and
*NL*
sufficient
reason
in
your
own
conscience
.
I
've
no
right
to
say
anything
*NL*
about
my
being
sorry

you
know
well
enough
what
cause
I
have
to
put
you

above
every
other

I

my

lived
with

all
our

I
should

counted
it
the
greatest
blessing
as
could
happen
to

now

But
*NL*
Seth
tells
me
there
's
no
hope

that

your
feelings
are
different

perhaps
I
'm
taking
too
much
upon

to
speak
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
made
no
answer
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
,
till
*NL*
they
came
to
the
stone
stile
,
where
,
as
Adam
had
passed
through
first
*NL*
and
turned
round
to
give
her
his
hand
while
she
mounted
the
unusually
*NL*
high
step
,
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
seeing
her
face
.
It
struck
*NL*
him
with
surprise
,
for
the
grey
eyes
,
usually
so
mild
and
grave
,
had
*NL*
the
bright
uneasy
glance
which
accompanies
suppressed
agitation
,
and
*NL*
the
slight
flush
in
her
cheeks
,
with
which
she
had
come
downstairs
,
was
*NL*
heightened
to
a
deep
rose-colour
.
She
looked
as
if
she
were
only
sister
*NL*
to
Dinah
.
Adam
was
silent
with
surprise
and
conjecture
for
some
moments
,
*NL*
and
then
he
said
,
``
I
hope
I
've
not
hurt
or
displeased
you
by
what
I
've
*NL*
said
,
Dinah
.
Perhaps
I
was
making
too
free
.
I
've
no
wish
different
from
*NL*
what
you
see
to
be
best
,
and
I
'm
satisfied
for
you
to
live
thirty
mile
*NL*
off
,
if
you
think
it
right
.
I
shall
think
of
you
just
as
much
as
I
do
*NL*
now
,
for
you
're
bound
up
with
what
I
can
no
more
help
remembering
than
I
*NL*
can
help
my
heart
beating
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Adam
!
Thus
do
men
blunder
.
Dinah
made
no
answer
,
but
she
presently
*NL*
said
,
``
Have
you
heard
any
news
from
that
poor
young
man
,
since
we
last
*NL*
spoke
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
always
called
Arthur
so
;
she
had
never
lost
the
image
of
him
as
*NL*
she
had
seen
him
in
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
Mr.
Irwine
read
me
part
of
a
letter
from
him
*NL*
yesterday
.
It
's
pretty
certain
,
they
say
,
that
there
'll
be
a
peace
soon
,
*NL*
though
nobody
believes
it
'll
last
long
;
but
he
says
he
does
n't
mean
to
*NL*
come
home
.
He
's
no
heart
for
it
yet
,
and
it
's
better
for
others
that
he
*NL*
should
keep
away
.
Mr.
Irwine
thinks
he
's
in
the
right
not
to
come
.
It
's
*NL*
a
sorrowful
letter
.
He
asks
about
you
and
the
Poysers
,
as
he
always
*NL*
does
.
There
's
one
thing
in
the
letter
cut
me
a
good
deal
:
`
You
ca
n't
*NL*
think
what
an
old
fellow
I
feel
,
'
he
says
;
'
I
make
no
schemes
now
.
I
'm
*NL*
the
best
when
I
've
a
good
day
's
march
or
fighting
before
me
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
of
a
rash
,
warm-hearted
nature
,
like
Esau
,
for
whom
I
have
always
*NL*
felt
great
pity
,
''
said
Dinah
.
``
That
meeting
between
the
brothers
,
where
*NL*
Esau
is
so
loving
and
generous
,
and
Jacob
so
timid
and
distrustful
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
his
sense
of
the
Divine
favour
,
has
always
touched
me
*NL*
greatly
.
Truly
,
I
have
been
tempted
sometimes
to
say
that
Jacob
was
of
a
*NL*
mean
spirit
.
But
that
is
our
trial
:
we
must
learn
to
see
the
good
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
much
that
is
unlovely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
I
like
to
read
about
Moses
best
,
in
th
'
Old
Testament
.
*NL*
He
carried
a
hard
business
well
through
,
and
died
when
other
folks
were
*NL*
going
to
reap
the
fruits
.
A
man
must
have
courage
to
look
at
his
life
*NL*
so
,
and
think
what
'll
come
of
it
after
he
's
dead
and
gone
.
A
good
solid
*NL*
bit
o
'
work
lasts
:
if
it
's
only
laying
a
floor
down
,
somebody
's
the
*NL*
better
for
it
being
done
well
,
besides
the
man
as
does
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
glad
to
talk
of
subjects
that
were
not
personal
,
and
*NL*
in
this
way
they
went
on
till
they
passed
the
bridge
across
the
Willow
*NL*
Brook
,
when
Adam
turned
round
and
said
,
``
Ah
,
here
's
Seth
.
I
thought
he
'd
*NL*
be
home
soon
.
Does
he
know
of
you
're
going
,
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
told
him
last
Sabbath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
remembered
now
that
Seth
had
come
home
much
depressed
on
Sunday
*NL*
evening
,
a
circumstance
which
had
been
very
unusual
with
him
of
late
,
*NL*
for
the
happiness
he
had
in
seeing
Dinah
every
week
seemed
long
to
have
*NL*
outweighed
the
pain
of
knowing
she
would
never
marry
him
.
This
evening
*NL*
he
had
his
habitual
air
of
dreamy
benignant
contentment
,
until
he
came
*NL*
quite
close
to
Dinah
and
saw
the
traces
of
tears
on
her
delicate
eyelids
*NL*
and
eyelashes
.
He
gave
one
rapid
glance
at
his
brother
,
but
Adam
was
*NL*
evidently
quite
outside
the
current
of
emotion
that
had
shaken
Dinah
:
he
*NL*
wore
his
everyday
look
of
unexpectant
calm
.
Seth
tried
not
to
let
Dinah
*NL*
see
that
he
had
noticed
her
face
,
and
only
said
,
``
I
'm
thankful
you
're
*NL*
come
,
Dinah
,
for
Mother
's
been
hungering
after
the
sight
of
you
all
day
.
*NL*
She
began
to
talk
of
you
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
entered
the
cottage
,
Lisbeth
was
seated
in
her
arm-chair
,
too
*NL*
tired
with
setting
out
the
evening
meal
,
a
task
she
always
performed
a
*NL*
long
time
beforehand
,
to
go
and
meet
them
at
the
door
as
usual
,
when
she
*NL*
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coom
,
child
,
thee
'
t
coom
at
last
,
''
she
said
,
when
Dinah
went
towards
*NL*
her
.
``
What
dost
mane
by
lavin
'
me
a
week
an
'
ne'er
coomin
'
a-nigh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friend
,
''
said
Dinah
,
taking
her
hand
,
``
you
're
not
well
.
If
I
'd
*NL*
known
it
sooner
,
I
'd
have
come

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An

how

Th

As
long

But
take

*NL*
off

an

at

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
was
moving
away
,
but
Lisbeth
held
her
fast
,
while
she
was
taking
*NL*
off
her
bonnet
,
and
looked
at
her
face
as
one
looks
into
a
newly
*NL*
gathered
snowdrop
,
to
renew
the
old
impressions
of
purity
and
*NL*
gentleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
thee
?
''
said
Lisbeth
,
in
astonishment
;
``
thee
`
st
*NL*
been
a-cryin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
a
grief
that
'll
pass
away
,
''
said
Dinah
,
who
did
not
wish
just
*NL*
now
to
call
forth
Lisbeth
's
remonstrances
by
disclosing
her
intention
*NL*
to
leave
Hayslope
.
``
You
shall
know
about
it
shortly
--
we
'll
talk
of
it
*NL*
to-night
.
I
shall
stay
with
you
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
was
pacified
by
this
prospect
.
And
she
had
the
whole
evening
*NL*
to
talk
with
Dinah
alone
;
for
there
was
a
new
room
in
the
cottage
,
*NL*
you
remember
,
built
nearly
two
years
ago
,
in
the
expectation
of
a
new
*NL*
inmate
;
and
here
Adam
always
sat
when
he
had
writing
to
do
or
plans
to
*NL*
make
.
Seth
sat
there
too
this
evening
,
for
he
knew
his
mother
would
like
*NL*
to
have
Dinah
all
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
pretty
pictures
on
the
two
sides
of
the
wall
in
the
*NL*
cottage
.
On
one
side
there
was
the
broad-shouldered
,
large-featured
,
*NL*
hardy
old
woman
,
in
her
blue
jacket
and
buff
kerchief
,
with
her
dim-eyed
*NL*
anxious
looks
turned
continually
on
the
lily
face
and
the
slight
form
*NL*
in
the
black
dress
that
were
either
moving
lightly
about
in
helpful
*NL*
activity
,
or
seated
close
by
the
old
woman
's
arm-chair
,
holding
her
*NL*
withered
hand
,
with
eyes
lifted
up
towards
her
to
speak
a
language
which
*NL*
Lisbeth
understood
far
better
than
the
Bible
or
the
hymn-book
.
She
would
*NL*
scarcely
listen
to
reading
at
all
to-night
.
``
Nay
,
nay
,
shut
the
book
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
We
mun
talk
.
I
want
t
'
know
what
thee
was
cryin
'
about
.
Hast
*NL*
got
troubles
o
'
thy
own
,
like
other
folks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
wall
there
were
the
two
brothers
so
like
each
*NL*
other
in
the
midst
of
their
unlikeness
:
Adam
with
knit
brows
,
shaggy
*NL*
hair
,
and
dark
vigorous
colour
,
absorbed
in
his
``
figuring
''
;
Seth
,
with
*NL*
large
rugged
features
,
the
close
copy
of
his
brother
's
,
but
with
thin
,
*NL*
wavy
,
brown
hair
and
blue
dreamy
eyes
,
as
often
as
not
looking
vaguely
*NL*
out
of
the
window
instead
of
at
his
book
,
although
it
was
a
newly
bought
*NL*
book
--
Wesley
's
abridgment
of
Madame
Guyon
's
life
,
which
was
full
of
*NL*
wonder
and
interest
for
him
.
Seth
had
said
to
Adam
,
``
Can
I
help
thee
*NL*
with
anything
in
here
to-night
?
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
noise
in
the
*NL*
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
lad
,
''
Adam
answered
,
``
there
's
nothing
but
what
I
must
do
myself
.
*NL*
Thee
`
st
got
thy
new
book
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
often
,
when
Seth
was
quite
unconscious
,
Adam
,
as
he
paused
after
*NL*
drawing
a
line
with
his
ruler
,
looked
at
his
brother
with
a
kind
smile
*NL*
dawning
in
his
eyes
.
He
knew
``
th
'
lad
liked
to
sit
full
o
'
thoughts
he
*NL*
could
give
no
account
of
;
they
'd
never
come
t
'
anything
,
but
they
made
*NL*
him
happy
,
''
and
in
the
last
year
or
so
,
Adam
had
been
getting
more
and
*NL*
more
indulgent
to
Seth
.
It
was
part
of
that
growing
tenderness
which
*NL*
came
from
the
sorrow
at
work
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Adam
,
though
you
see
him
quite
master
of
himself
,
working
hard
and
*NL*
delighting
in
his
work
after
his
inborn
inalienable
nature
,
had
not
*NL*
outlived
his
sorrow
--
had
not
felt
it
slip
from
him
as
a
temporary
*NL*
burden
,
and
leave
him
the
same
man
again
.
Do
any
of
us
?
God
forbid
.
It
*NL*
would
be
a
poor
result
of
all
our
anguish
and
our
wrestling
if
we
won
*NL*
nothing
but
our
old
selves
at
the
end
of
it
--
if
we
could
return
to
the
*NL*
same
blind
loves
,
the
same
self-confident
blame
,
the
same
light
thoughts
*NL*
of
human
suffering
,
the
same
frivolous
gossip
over
blighted
human
lives
,
*NL*
the
same
feeble
sense
of
that
Unknown
towards
which
we
have
sent
forth
*NL*
irrepressible
cries
in
our
loneliness
.
Let
us
rather
be
thankful
that
*NL*
our
sorrow
lives
in
us
as
an
indestructible
force
,
only
changing
its
*NL*
form
,
as
forces
do
,
and
passing
from
pain
into
sympathy
--
the
one
poor
*NL*
word
which
includes
all
our
best
insight
and
our
best
love
.
Not
that
*NL*
this
transformation
of
pain
into
sympathy
had
completely
taken
place
*NL*
in
Adam
yet
.
There
was
still
a
great
remnant
of
pain
,
and
this
he
felt
*NL*
would
subsist
as
long
as
her
pain
was
not
a
memory
,
but
an
existing
*NL*
thing
,
which
he
must
think
of
as
renewed
with
the
light
of
every
*NL*
new
morning
.
But
we
get
accustomed
to
mental
as
well
as
bodily
pain
,
*NL*
without
,
for
all
that
,
losing
our
sensibility
to
it
.
It
becomes
a
habit
*NL*
of
our
lives
,
and
we
cease
to
imagine
a
condition
of
perfect
ease
*NL*
as
possible
for
us
.
Desire
is
chastened
into
submission
,
and
we
are
*NL*
contented
with
our
day
when
we
have
been
able
to
bear
our
grief
in
*NL*
silence
and
act
as
if
we
were
not
suffering
.
For
it
is
at
such
periods
*NL*
that
the
sense
of
our
lives
having
visible
and
invisible
relations
,
*NL*
beyond
any
of
which
either
our
present
or
prospective
self
is
the
*NL*
centre
,
grows
like
a
muscle
that
we
are
obliged
to
lean
on
and
exert
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Adam
's
state
of
mind
in
this
second
autumn
of
his
sorrow
.
His
*NL*
work
,
as
you
know
,
had
always
been
part
of
his
religion
,
and
from
very
*NL*
early
days
he
saw
clearly
that
good
carpentry
was
God
's
will
--
was
that
*NL*
form
of
God
's
will
that
most
immediately
concerned
him
.
But
now
there
*NL*
was
no
margin
of
dreams
for
him
beyond
this
daylight
reality
,
no
*NL*
holiday-time
in
the
working-day
world
,
no
moment
in
the
distance
when
*NL*
duty
would
take
off
her
iron
glove
and
breast-plate
and
clasp
him
gently
*NL*
into
rest
.
He
conceived
no
picture
of
the
future
but
one
made
up
of
*NL*
hard-working
days
such
as
he
lived
through
,
with
growing
contentment
and
*NL*
intensity
of
interest
,
every
fresh
week
.
Love
,
he
thought
,
could
never
*NL*
be
anything
to
him
but
a
living
memory
--
a
limb
lopped
off
,
but
not
gone
*NL*
from
consciousness
.
He
did
not
know
that
the
power
of
loving
was
all
the
*NL*
while
gaining
new
force
within
him
;
that
the
new
sensibilities
bought
by
*NL*
a
deep
experience
were
so
many
new
fibres
by
which
it
was
possible
,
nay
,
*NL*
necessary
to
him
,
that
his
nature
should
intertwine
with
another
.
Yet
he
*NL*
was
aware
that
common
affection
and
friendship
were
more
precious
to
him
*NL*
than
they
used
to
be
--
that
he
clung
more
to
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
*NL*
had
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
in
the
sight
or
imagination
of
any
small
*NL*
addition
to
their
happiness
.
The
Poysers
,
too
--
hardly
three
or
four
days
*NL*
passed
but
he
felt
the
need
of
seeing
them
and
interchanging
words
and
*NL*
looks
of
friendliness
with
them
.
He
would
have
felt
this
,
probably
,
even
*NL*
if
Dinah
had
not
been
with
them
,
but
he
had
only
said
the
simplest
truth
*NL*
in
telling
Dinah
that
he
put
her
above
all
other
friends
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Could
anything
be
more
natural
?
For
in
the
darkest
moments
of
memory
the
*NL*
thought
of
her
always
came
as
the
first
ray
of
returning
comfort
.
The
*NL*
early
days
of
gloom
at
the
Hall
Farm
had
been
gradually
turned
into
soft
*NL*
moonlight
by
her
presence
;
and
in
the
cottage
,
too
,
for
she
had
come
*NL*
at
every
spare
moment
to
soothe
and
cheer
poor
Lisbeth
,
who
had
been
*NL*
stricken
with
a
fear
that
subdued
even
her
querulousness
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
her
darling
Adam
's
grief-worn
face
.
He
had
become
used
to
watching
her
*NL*
light
quiet
movements
,
her
pretty
loving
ways
to
the
children
,
when
he
*NL*
went
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
to
listen
for
her
voice
as
for
a
recurrent
music
;
*NL*
to
think
everything
she
said
and
did
was
just
right
,
and
could
not
have
*NL*
been
better
.
In
spite
of
his
wisdom
,
he
could
not
find
fault
with
her
*NL*
for
her
overindulgence
of
the
children
,
who
had
managed
to
convert
Dinah
*NL*
the
preacher
,
before
whom
a
circle
of
rough
men
had
often
trembled
a
*NL*
little
,
into
a
convenient
household
slave
--
though
Dinah
herself
was
*NL*
rather
ashamed
of
this
weakness
,
and
had
some
inward
conflict
as
to
her
*NL*
departure
from
the
precepts
of
Solomon
.
Yes
,
there
was
one
thing
that
*NL*
might
have
been
better
;
she
might
have
loved
Seth
and
consented
to
marry
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
a
little
vexed
,
for
his
brother
's
sake
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
help
thinking
regretfully
how
Dinah
,
as
Seth
's
wife
,
would
have
made
*NL*
their
home
as
happy
as
it
could
be
for
them
all
--
how
she
was
the
one
*NL*
being
that
would
have
soothed
their
mother
's
last
days
into
peacefulness
*NL*
and
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
she
does
n't
love
th
'
lad
,
''
Adam
had
said
sometimes
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
for
anybody
`
ud
think
he
was
just
cut
out
for
her
.
But
her
*NL*
heart
's
so
taken
up
with
other
things
.
She
's
one
o
'
those
women
that
*NL*
feel
no
drawing
towards
having
a
husband
and
children
o
'
their
own
.
She
*NL*
thinks
she
should
be
filled
up
with
her
own
life
then
,
and
she
's
been
*NL*
used
so
to
living
in
other
folks
's
cares
,
she
ca
n't
bear
the
thought
of
*NL*
her
heart
being
shut
up
from
'em
.
I
see
how
it
is
,
well
enough
.
She
's
*NL*
cut
out
o
'
different
stuff
from
most
women
:
I
saw
that
long
ago
.
She
's
*NL*
never
easy
but
when
she
's
helping
somebody
,
and
marriage
`
ud
interfere
*NL*
with
her
ways
--
that
's
true
.
I
've
no
right
to
be
contriving
and
thinking
*NL*
it
`
ud
be
better
if
she
'd
have
Seth
,
as
if
I
was
wiser
than
she
is
--
or
*NL*
than
God
either
,
for
He
made
her
what
she
is
,
and
that
's
one
o
'
the
*NL*
greatest
blessings
I
've
ever
had
from
His
hands
,
and
others
besides
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
self-reproof
had
recurred
strongly
to
Adam
's
mind
when
he
gathered
*NL*
from
Dinah
's
face
that
he
had
wounded
her
by
referring
to
his
wish
*NL*
that
she
had
accepted
Seth
,
and
so
he
had
endeavoured
to
put
into
the
*NL*
strongest
words
his
confidence
in
her
decision
as
right
--
his
resignation
*NL*
even
to
her
going
away
from
them
and
ceasing
to
make
part
of
their
life
*NL*
otherwise
than
by
living
in
their
thoughts
,
if
that
separation
were
*NL*
chosen
by
herself
.
He
felt
sure
she
knew
quite
well
enough
how
much
*NL*
he
cared
to
see
her
continually
--
to
talk
to
her
with
the
silent
*NL*
consciousness
of
a
mutual
great
remembrance
.
It
was
not
possible
she
*NL*
should
hear
anything
but
self-renouncing
affection
and
respect
in
*NL*
his
assurance
that
he
was
contented
for
her
to
go
away
;
and
yet
there
*NL*
remained
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
mind
that
he
had
not
said
quite
the
*NL*
right
thing
--
that
,
somehow
,
Dinah
had
not
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
must
have
risen
a
little
before
the
sun
the
next
morning
,
for
she
*NL*
was
downstairs
about
five
o'clock
.
So
was
Seth
,
for
,
through
Lisbeth
's
*NL*
obstinate
refusal
to
have
any
woman-helper
in
the
house
,
he
had
learned
*NL*
to
make
himself
,
as
Adam
said
,
``
very
handy
in
the
housework
,
''
that
he
*NL*
might
save
his
mother
from
too
great
weariness
;
on
which
ground
I
hope
*NL*
you
will
not
think
him
unmanly
,
any
more
than
you
can
have
thought
the
*NL*
gallant
Colonel
Bath
unmanly
when
he
made
the
gruel
for
his
invalid
*NL*
sister
.
Adam
,
who
had
sat
up
late
at
his
writing
,
was
still
asleep
,
*NL*
and
was
not
likely
,
Seth
said
,
to
be
down
till
breakfast-time
.
Often
as
*NL*
Dinah
had
visited
Lisbeth
during
the
last
eighteen
months
,
she
had
never
*NL*
slept
in
the
cottage
since
that
night
after
Thias
's
death
,
when
,
you
*NL*
remember
,
Lisbeth
praised
her
deft
movements
and
even
gave
a
modified
*NL*
approval
to
her
porridge
.
But
in
that
long
interval
Dinah
had
made
great
*NL*
advances
in
household
cleverness
,
and
this
morning
,
since
Seth
was
there
*NL*
to
help
,
she
was
bent
on
bringing
everything
to
a
pitch
of
cleanliness
*NL*
and
order
that
would
have
satisfied
her
Aunt
Poyser
.
The
cottage
was
far
*NL*
from
that
standard
at
present
,
for
Lisbeth
's
rheumatism
had
forced
her
*NL*
to
give
up
her
old
habits
of
dilettante
scouring
and
polishing
.
When
the
*NL*
kitchen
was
to
her
mind
,
Dinah
went
into
the
new
room
,
where
Adam
had
*NL*
been
writing
the
night
before
,
to
see
what
sweeping
and
dusting
were
*NL*
needed
there
.
She
opened
the
window
and
let
in
the
fresh
morning
air
,
*NL*
and
the
smell
of
the
sweet-brier
,
and
the
bright
low-slanting
rays
of
*NL*
the
early
sun
,
which
made
a
glory
about
her
pale
face
and
pale
auburn
*NL*
hair
as
she
held
the
long
brush
,
and
swept
,
singing
to
herself
in
a
very
*NL*
low
tone
--
like
a
sweet
summer
murmur
that
you
have
to
listen
for
very
*NL*
closely
--
one
of
Charles
Wesley
's
hymns
:
*NL*
*NL*
Eternal
Beam
of
Light
Divine
,
*NL*
Fountain
of
unexhausted
love
,
*NL*
In
whom
the
Father
's
glories
shine
,
*NL*
Through
earth
beneath
and
heaven
above
;
*NL*
*NL*
Jesus
!
the
weary
wanderer
's
rest
,
*NL*
Give
me
thy
easy
yoke
to
bear
;
*NL*
With
steadfast
patience
arm
my
breast
,
*NL*
With
spotless
love
and
holy
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Speak
to
my
warring
passions
,
``
Peace
!
''
*NL*
Say
to
my
trembling
heart
,
``
Be
still
!
''
*NL*
Thy
power
my
strength
and
fortress
is
,
*NL*
For
all
things
serve
thy
sovereign
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
by
the
brush
and
took
up
the
duster
;
and
if
you
had
ever
lived
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
household
,
you
would
know
how
the
duster
behaved
in
*NL*
Dinah
's
hand
--
how
it
went
into
every
small
corner
,
and
on
every
ledge
*NL*
in
and
out
of
sight
--
how
it
went
again
and
again
round
every
bar
of
the
*NL*
chairs
,
and
every
leg
,
and
under
and
over
everything
that
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
,
till
it
came
to
Adam
's
papers
and
rulers
and
the
open
desk
near
*NL*
them
.
Dinah
dusted
up
to
the
very
edge
of
these
and
then
hesitated
,
*NL*
looking
at
them
with
a
longing
but
timid
eye
.
It
was
painful
to
see
*NL*
how
much
dust
there
was
among
them
.
As
she
was
looking
in
this
way
,
she
*NL*
heard
Seth
's
step
just
outside
the
open
door
,
towards
which
her
back
*NL*
was
turned
,
and
said
,
raising
her
clear
treble
,
``
Seth
,
is
your
brother
*NL*
wrathful
when
his
papers
are
stirred
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
,
when
they
are
not
put
back
in
the
right
places
,
''
said
a
deep
*NL*
strong
voice
,
not
Seth
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
Dinah
had
put
her
hands
unawares
on
a
vibrating
chord
.
*NL*
She
was
shaken
with
an
intense
thrill
,
and
for
the
instant
felt
nothing
*NL*
else
;
then
she
knew
her
cheeks
were
glowing
,
and
dared
not
look
round
,
*NL*
but
stood
still
,
distressed
because
she
could
not
say
good-morning
in
a
*NL*
friendly
way
.
Adam
,
finding
that
she
did
not
look
round
so
as
to
see
*NL*
the
smile
on
his
face
,
was
afraid
she
had
thought
him
serious
about
his
*NL*
wrathfulness
,
and
went
up
to
her
,
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
look
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
You
think
I
'm
a
cross
fellow
at
home
,
Dinah
?
''
he
said
,
smilingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Dinah
,
looking
up
with
timid
eyes
,
``
not
so
.
But
you
might
*NL*
be
put
about
by
finding
things
meddled
with
;
and
even
the
man
Moses
,
the
*NL*
meekest
of
men
,
was
wrathful
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
,
''
said
Adam
,
looking
at
her
affectionately
,
``
I
'll
help
you
*NL*
move
the
things
,
and
put
'em
back
again
,
and
then
they
ca
n't
get
wrong
.
*NL*
You
're
getting
to
be
your
aunt
's
own
niece
,
I
see
,
for
particularness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
their
little
task
together
,
but
Dinah
had
not
recovered
*NL*
herself
sufficiently
to
think
of
any
remark
,
and
Adam
looked
at
her
*NL*
uneasily
.
Dinah
,
he
thought
,
had
seemed
to
disapprove
him
somehow
*NL*
lately
;
she
had
not
been
so
kind
and
open
to
him
as
she
used
to
be
.
*NL*
He
wanted
her
to
look
at
him
,
and
be
as
pleased
as
he
was
himself
with
*NL*
doing
this
bit
of
playful
work
.
But
Dinah
did
not
look
at
him
--
it
was
*NL*
easy
for
her
to
avoid
looking
at
the
tall
man
--
and
when
at
last
there
*NL*
was
no
more
dusting
to
be
done
and
no
further
excuse
for
him
to
linger
*NL*
near
her
,
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
said
,
in
rather
a
pleading
*NL*
tone
,
``
Dinah
,
you
're
not
displeased
with
me
for
anything
,
are
you
?
I
've
*NL*
not
said
or
done
anything
to
make
you
think
ill
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
surprised
her
,
and
relieved
her
by
giving
a
new
course
to
*NL*
her
feeling
.
She
looked
up
at
him
now
,
quite
earnestly
,
almost
with
the
*NL*
tears
coming
,
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
no
,
Adam
!
how
could
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
bear
you
not
to
feel
as
much
a
friend
to
me
as
I
do
to
you
,
''
*NL*
said
Adam
.
``
And
you
do
n't
know
the
value
I
set
on
the
very
thought
of
*NL*
you
,
Dinah
.
That
was
what
I
meant
yesterday
,
when
I
said
I
'd
be
content
*NL*
for
you
to
go
,
if
you
thought
right
.
I
meant
,
the
thought
of
you
was
*NL*
worth
so
much
to
me
,
I
should
feel
I
ought
to
be
thankful
,
and
not
*NL*
grumble
,
if
you
see
right
to
go
away
.
You
know
I
do
mind
parting
with
*NL*
you
,
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
friend
,
''
said
Dinah
,
trembling
,
but
trying
to
speak
calmly
,
*NL*
``
I
know
you
have
a
brother
's
heart
towards
me
,
and
we
shall
often
be
*NL*
with
one
another
in
spirit
;
but
at
this
season
I
am
in
heaviness
through
*NL*
manifold
temptations
.
You
must
not
mark
me
.
I
feel
called
to
leave
my
*NL*
kindred
for
a
while
;
but
it
is
a
trial
--
the
flesh
is
weak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
saw
that
it
pained
her
to
be
obliged
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hurt
you
by
talking
about
it
,
Dinah
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
say
no
more
.
*NL*
Let
's
see
if
Seth
's
ready
with
breakfast
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
a
simple
scene
,
reader
.
But
it
is
almost
certain
that
you
,
too
,
*NL*
have
been
in
love
--
perhaps
,
even
,
more
than
once
,
though
you
may
not
*NL*
choose
to
say
so
to
all
your
feminine
friends
.
If
so
,
you
will
no
more
*NL*
think
the
slight
words
,
the
timid
looks
,
the
tremulous
touches
,
by
which
*NL*
two
human
souls
approach
each
other
gradually
,
like
two
little
quivering
*NL*
rain-streams
,
before
they
mingle
into
one
--
you
will
no
more
think
these
*NL*
things
trivial
than
you
will
think
the
first-detected
signs
of
coming
*NL*
spring
trivial
,
though
they
be
but
a
faint
indescribable
something
*NL*
in
the
air
and
in
the
song
of
the
birds
,
and
the
tiniest
perceptible
*NL*
budding
on
the
hedge-row
branches
.
Those
slight
words
and
looks
and
*NL*
touches
are
part
of
the
soul
's
language
;
and
the
finest
language
,
*NL*
I
believe
,
is
chiefly
made
up
of
unimposing
words
,
such
as
``
light
,
''
*NL*
``
sound
,
''
``
stars
,
''
``
music
''
--
words
really
not
worth
looking
at
,
or
*NL*
hearing
,
in
themselves
,
any
more
than
``
chips
''
or
``
sawdust
.
''
It
is
only
*NL*
that
they
happen
to
be
the
signs
of
something
unspeakably
great
and
*NL*
beautiful
.
I
am
of
opinion
that
love
is
a
great
and
beautiful
thing
too
,
*NL*
and
if
you
agree
with
me
,
the
smallest
signs
of
it
will
not
be
chips
and
*NL*
sawdust
to
you
:
they
will
rather
be
like
those
little
words
,
``
light
''
and
*NL*
``
music
,
''
stirring
the
long-winding
fibres
of
your
memory
and
enriching
*NL*
your
present
with
your
most
precious
past
.

LISBETH
'S
touch
of
rheumatism
could
not
be
made
to
appear
serious
enough
*NL*
to
detain
Dinah
another
night
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
now
she
had
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
to
leave
her
aunt
so
soon
,
and
at
evening
the
friends
must
*NL*
part
.
``
For
a
long
while
,
''
Dinah
had
said
,
for
she
had
told
Lisbeth
of
*NL*
her
resolve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
'll
be
for
all
my
life
,
an
'
I
shall
ne'er
see
thee
again
,
''
said
*NL*
Lisbeth
.
``
Long
while
!
I
'n
got
no
long
while
t
'
live
.
An
'
I
shall
be
*NL*
took
bad
an
'
die
,
an
'
thee
canst
ne'er
come
a-nigh
me
,
an
'
I
shall
die
*NL*
a-longing
for
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
had
been
the
key-note
of
her
wailing
talk
all
day
;
for
Adam
was
not
*NL*
in
the
house
,
and
so
she
put
no
restraint
on
her
complaining
.
She
had
*NL*
tried
poor
Dinah
by
returning
again
and
again
to
the
question
,
why
*NL*
she
must
go
away
;
and
refusing
to
accept
reasons
,
which
seemed
to
her
*NL*
nothing
but
whim
and
``
contrairiness
''
;
and
still
more
,
by
regretting
that
*NL*
she
``
couldna
'
ha
'
one
o
'
the
lads
''
and
be
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
couldstna
put
up
wi
'
Seth
,
''
she
said
.
``
He
isna
cliver
enough
for
*NL*
thee
,
happen
,
but
he
'd
ha
'
been
very
good
t
'
thee
--
he
's
as
handy
as
can
*NL*
be
at
doin
'
things
for
me
when
I
'm
bad
,
an
'
he
's
as
fond
o
'
the
Bible
*NL*
an
'
chappellin

as
thee
art
thysen

But
happen

thee

a
husband
*NL*
better

just
the

Adam

ud
ha

done
for
thee
--
I
know
he
would
--
an
'
he
might
*NL*
come
t
'
like
thee
well
enough
,
if
thee
`
dst
stop
.
But
he
's
as
stubborn
*NL*
as
th
'
iron
bar
--
there
's
no
bending
him
no
way
but
's
own
.
But
he
'd
be
*NL*
a
fine
husband
for
anybody
,
be
they
who
they
will
,
so
looked-on
an
'
so
*NL*
cliver
as
he
is
.
And
he
'd
be
rare
an
'
lovin
'
:
it
does
me
good
on
'
y
a
*NL*
look
o
'
the
lad
's
eye
when
he
means
kind
tow
`
rt
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
tried
to
escape
from
Lisbeth
's
closest
looks
and
questions
by
*NL*
finding
little
tasks
of
housework
that
kept
her
moving
about
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
Seth
came
home
in
the
evening
she
put
on
her
bonnet
to
go
.
It
*NL*
touched
Dinah
keenly
to
say
the
last
good-bye
,
and
still
more
to
look
*NL*
round
on
her
way
across
the
fields
and
see
the
old
woman
still
standing
*NL*
at
the
door
,
gazing
after
her
till
she
must
have
been
the
faintest
speck
*NL*
in
the
dim
aged
eyes
.
``
The
God
of
love
and
peace
be
with
them
,
''
*NL*
Dinah
prayed
,
as
she
looked
back
from
the
last
stile
.
``
Make
them
glad
*NL*
according
to
the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
them
,
and
the
years
*NL*
wherein
they
have
seen
evil
.
It
is
thy
will
that
I
should
part
from
*NL*
them
;
let
me
have
no
will
but
thine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
turned
into
the
house
at
last
and
sat
down
in
the
workshop
near
*NL*
Seth
,
who
was
busying
himself
there
with
fitting
some
bits
of
turned
*NL*
wood
he
had
brought
from
the
village
into
a
small
work-box
,
which
he
*NL*
meant
to
give
to
Dinah
before
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
'
t
see
her
again
o
'
Sunday
afore
she
goes
,
''
were
her
first
words
.
*NL*
``

good
for
anything

thee

and
see
me
once
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

Mother
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
Dinah
`

be
sure
to
come
again
if
she
saw
*NL*
right

I
should
have
no

to
persuade
her
.
She
only
thinks
it
*NL*
`

be
troubling
thee
for
nought
,
just
to
come
in
to
say
good-bye
over
*NL*
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
ne'er
go
away

I
know
,

*NL*
but
everything
's
so
contrairy
,
''
said
Lisbeth
,
with
a
burst
of
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
paused
a
moment
and
looked
up
,
with
a
slight
blush
,
at
his
mother
's
*NL*
face
.
``
What
!
Has
she
said
anything
o
'
that
sort
to
thee
,
Mother
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
lower
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
?
Nay
,
she
'll
say
nothin
'
.
It
's
on
'
y
the
men
as
have
to
wait
till
*NL*
folks
say
things
afore
they
find
'em
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
what
makes
thee
think
so
,
Mother
?
What
's
put
it
into
thy
*NL*
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
matter
what
's
put
it
into
my
head
.
My
head
's
none
so
hollow
as
*NL*
it
must
get
in
,
an
'
nought
to
put
it
there

I
know
she

fond

he
'll
ne'er

think
o
n't

somebody
doesna

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
's
suggestion
about
Dinah
's
feeling
towards
Adam
was
not
quite
*NL*
a
new
thought
to
Seth
,
but
her
last
words
alarmed
him
,
lest
she
should
*NL*
herself
undertake
to
open
Adam
's
eyes
.
He
was
not
sure
about
Dinah
's
*NL*
feeling
,
and
he
thought
he
was
sure
about
Adam
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Mother
,
nay
,
''
he
said
,
earnestly
,
``
thee
mustna
think
o
'
speaking
*NL*
o
'
such
things
to
Adam
.
Thee
`
st
no
right
to
say
what
Dinah
's
feelings
*NL*
are
if
she
hasna
told
thee
,
and
it
`
ud
do
nothing
but
mischief
to
say
*NL*
such
things
to
Adam
.
He
feels
very
grateful
and
affectionate
toward
*NL*
Dinah
,
but
he
's
no
thoughts
towards
her
that
`
ud
incline
him
to
make
her
*NL*
his
wife
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
Dinah
`
ud
marry
him
either
.
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
she
'll
marry
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
''
said
Lisbeth
,
impatiently
.
``
Thee

`
st
so
'cause
she
wouldna

thee

She

well

*NL*

brother

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
hurt
.
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
remonstrating
tone
,
``
do
n't
think
*NL*
that

it
hard

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*
``

What

goin

to
the
Poysers
'
for
,
if
he
didna

*NL*
He
goes
twice
where
he
used

Happen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

said
Seth
,
``
thee

going

to

what

besides
that
,
I
think
I
should
give
offence
to

by

speaking

him
at
all
about

and
I
counsel
thee
not

may
`

be
quite
deceived

I

pretty

Sabbath

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

as
contrairy

the
rest

If

summat
I
didna
*NL*

it
`
ud
be
done
fast

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
rose
from
the
bench
at
this
,
and
went
out
of
the
workshop
,
*NL*
leaving
Seth
in
much
anxiety
lest
she
should
disturb
Adam
's
mind
about
*NL*
Dinah
.
He
consoled
himself
after
a
time
with
reflecting
that
,
since
*NL*
Adam
's
trouble
,
Lisbeth
had
been
very
timid
about
speaking
to
him
on
*NL*
matters
of
feeling
,
and
that
she
would
hardly
dare
to
approach
this
*NL*
tenderest
of
all
subjects
.
Even
if
she
did
,
he
hoped
Adam
would
not
take
*NL*
much
notice
of
what
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
right
in
believing
that
Lisbeth
would
be
held
in
restraint
by
*NL*
timidity
,
and
during
the
next
three
days
,
the
intervals
in
which
she
had
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Adam
were
too
rare
and
short
to
cause
her
*NL*
any
strong
temptation
.
But
in
her
long
solitary
hours
she
brooded
over
*NL*
her
regretful
thoughts
about
Dinah
,
till
they
had
grown
very
near
that
*NL*
point
of
unmanageable
strength
when
thoughts
are
apt
to
take
wing
out
*NL*
of
their
secret
nest
in
a
startling
manner
.
And
on
Sunday
morning
,
when
*NL*
Seth
went
away
to
chapel
at
Treddleston
,
the
dangerous
opportunity
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
morning
was
the
happiest
time
in
all
the
week
to
Lisbeth
,
for
*NL*
as
there
was
no
service
at
Hayslope
church
till
the
afternoon
,
Adam
was
*NL*
always
at
home
,
doing
nothing
but
reading
,
an
occupation
in
which
she
*NL*
could
venture
to
interrupt
him
.
Moreover
,
she
had
always
a
better
dinner
*NL*
than
usual
to
prepare
for
her
sons
--
very
frequently
for
Adam
and
herself
*NL*
alone
,
Seth
being
often
away
the
entire
day
--
and
the
smell
of
the
roast
*NL*
meat
before
the
clear
fire
in
the
clean
kitchen
,
the
clock
ticking
in
*NL*
a
peaceful
Sunday
manner
,
her
darling
Adam
seated
near
her
in
his
best
*NL*
clothes
,
doing
nothing
very
important
,
so
that
she
could
go
and
stroke
*NL*
her
hand
across
his
hair
if
she
liked
,
and
see
him
look
up
at
her
and
*NL*
smile
,
while
Gyp
,
rather
jealous
,
poked
his
muzzle
up
between
them
--
all
*NL*
these
things
made
poor
Lisbeth
's
earthly
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
Adam
most
often
read
on
a
Sunday
morning
was
his
large
pictured
*NL*
Bible
,
and
this
morning
it
lay
open
before
him
on
the
round
white
deal
*NL*
table
in
the
kitchen
;
for
he
sat
there
in
spite
of
the
fire
,
because
he
*NL*
knew
his
mother
liked
to
have
him
with
her
,
and
it
was
the
only
day
in
*NL*
the
week
when
he
could
indulge
her
in
that
way
.
You
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
see
Adam
reading
his
Bible
.
He
never
opened
it
on
a
weekday
,
and
so
he
*NL*
came
to
it
as
a
holiday
book
,
serving
him
for
history
,
biography
,
and
*NL*
poetry
.
He
held
one
hand
thrust
between
his
waistcoat
buttons
,
and
the
*NL*
other
ready
to
turn
the
pages
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
you
*NL*
would
have
seen
many
changes
in
his
face
.
Sometimes
his
lips
moved
in
*NL*
semi-articulation
--
it
was
when
he
came
to
a
speech
that
he
could
fancy
*NL*
himself
uttering
,
such
as
Samuel
's
dying
speech
to
the
people
;
then
his
*NL*
eyebrows
would
be
raised
,
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
would
quiver
a
*NL*
little
with
sad
sympathy
--
something
,
perhaps
old
Isaac
's
meeting
with
*NL*
his
son
,
touched
him
closely
;
at
other
times
,
over
the
New
Testament
,
*NL*
a
very
solemn
look
would
come
upon
his
face
,
and
he
would
every
now
and
*NL*
then
shake
his
head
in
serious
assent
,
or
just
lift
up
his
hand
and
let
*NL*
it
fall
again
.
And
on
some
mornings
,
when
he
read
in
the
Apocrypha
,
of
*NL*
which
he
was
very
fond
,
the
son
of
Sirach
's
keen-edged
words
would
bring
*NL*
a
delighted
smile
,
though
he
also
enjoyed
the
freedom
of
occasionally
*NL*
differing
from
an
Apocryphal
writer
.
For
Adam
knew
the
Articles
quite
*NL*
well
,
as
became
a
good
churchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
,
in
the
pauses
of
attending
to
her
dinner
,
always
sat
opposite
*NL*
to
him
and
watched
him
,
till
she
could
rest
no
longer
without
going
*NL*
up
to
him
and
giving
him
a
caress
,
to
call
his
attention
to
her
.
This
*NL*
morning
he
was
reading
the
Gospel
according
to
St.
Matthew
,
and
Lisbeth
*NL*
had
been
standing
close
by
him
for
some
minutes
,
stroking
his
hair
,
*NL*
which
was
smoother
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
looking
down
at
the
*NL*
large
page
with
silent
wonderment
at
the
mystery
of
letters
.
She
was
*NL*
encouraged
to
continue
this
caress
,
because
when
she
first
went
up
*NL*
to
him
,
he
had
thrown
himself
back
in
his
chair
to
look
at
her
*NL*
affectionately
and
say
,
``
Why
,
Mother
,
thee
look
`
st
rare
and
hearty
this
*NL*
morning
.
Eh
,
Gyp
wants
me
t
'
look
at
him
.
He
ca
n't
abide
to
think
I
love
*NL*
thee
the
best
.
''
Lisbeth
said
nothing
,
because
she
wanted
to
say
so
many
*NL*
things
.
And
now
there
was
a
new
leaf
to
be
turned
over
,
and
it
was
*NL*
a
picture
--
that
of
the
angel
seated
on
the
great
stone
that
has
been
*NL*
rolled
away
from
the
sepulchre
.
This
picture
had
one
strong
association
*NL*
in
Lisbeth
's
memory
,
for
she
had
been
reminded
of
it
when
she
first
*NL*
saw
Dinah
,
and
Adam
had
no
sooner
turned
the
page
,
and
lifted
the
book
*NL*
sideways
that
they
might
look
at
the
angel
,
than
she
said
,
``
That
's
*NL*
her
--
that
's
Dinah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
smiled
,
and
,
looking
more
intently
at
the
angel
's
face
,
said
,
``
It
*NL*
is
a
bit
like
her
;
but
Dinah
's
prettier
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
if
thee
think
`
st
her
so
pretty
,
why
ar
n't
fond
on
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
looked
up
in
surprise
.
``
Why
,
Mother
,
dost
think
I
do
n't
set
store
*NL*
by
Dinah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Lisbeth
,
frightened
at
her
own
courage
,
yet
feeling
that
*NL*
she
had
broken
the
ice
,
and
the
waters
must
flow
,
whatever
mischief
they
*NL*
might
do
.
``
What
's
th
'
use
o
'
settin
'
store
by
things
as
are
thirty
mile
*NL*
off
?
If
thee
wast
fond
enough
on
her
,
thee
wouldstna
let
her
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
no
right
t
'
hinder
her
,
if
she
thinks
well
,
''
said
Adam
,
*NL*
looking
at
his
book
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
on
reading
.
He
foresaw
a
*NL*
series
of
complaints
tending
to
nothing
.
Lisbeth
sat
down
again
in
the
*NL*
chair
opposite
to
him
,
as
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
wouldna
think
well
if
thee
wastna
so
contrairy
.
''
Lisbeth
dared
*NL*
not
venture
beyond
a
vague
phrase
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Contrairy
,
mother
?
''
Adam
said
,
looking
up
again
in
some
anxiety
.
``
What
*NL*
have
I
done
?
What
dost
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
thee

t
never

,

,
but

said
Lisbeth
,
half-crying
.
``
An

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Adam
,
vexed
at
this
*NL*
whimpering
.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
silent
,
and
tried
to
go
on
reading
.
That
was
the
utmost
*NL*
severity
he
could
show
towards
his
mother
on
a
Sunday
morning
.
But
*NL*
Lisbeth
had
gone
too
far
now
to
check
herself
,
and
after
scarcely
a
*NL*
minute
's
quietness
she
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee

know
well
enough

*NL*

said
Adam

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
his
mother
.
He
*NL*
understood
now
what
she
had
been
aiming
at
from
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
conversation
.
It
was
as
unreasonable
,
impracticable
a
wish
as
she
had
*NL*
ever
urged
,
but
he
could
not
help
being
moved
by
so
entirely
new
an
*NL*
idea
.
The
chief
point
,
however
,
was
to
chase
away
the
notion
from
his
*NL*
mother
's
mind
as
quickly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
gravely
,
``
thee
'
t
talking
wild
.
Do
n't
let
me
hear
*NL*
thee
say
such
things
again
.
It
's
no
good
talking
o
'
what
can
never
be
.
*NL*
Dinah
's
not
for
marrying
;
she
's
fixed
her
heart
on
a
different
sort
o
'
*NL*
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
like
,
''
said
Lisbeth
,
impatiently
,
``
very
like
she

none

as

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
Adam
's
face
,
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
not
quite
*NL*
conscious
where
he
was
.
His
mother
and
the
kitchen
had
vanished
for
him
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
nothing
but
Dinah
's
face
turned
up
towards
his
.
It
seemed
*NL*
as
if
there
were
a
resurrection
of
his
dead
joy
.
But
he
woke
up
very
*NL*
speedily
from
that
dream
-LRB-
the
waking
was
chill
and
sad
-RRB-
,
for
it
would
*NL*
have
been
very
foolish
in
him
to
believe
his
mother
's
words
--
she
could
*NL*
have
no
ground
for
them
.
He
was
prompted
to
express
his
disbelief
very
*NL*
strongly
--
perhaps
that
he
might
call
forth
the
proofs
,
if
there
were
any
*NL*
to
be
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
say
such
things
for

Mother

when
thee

got
no
foundation

Thee

nothing

a
right
to

that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
knowna
nought

Adam
*NL*
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
had
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
was
looking
down
at
the
*NL*
book
on
the
table
,
without
seeing
any
of
the
letters
.
He
was
trembling
*NL*
like
a
gold-seeker
who
sees
the
strong
promise
of
gold
but
sees
in
the
*NL*
same
moment
a
sickening
vision
of
disappointment
.
He
could
not
trust
his
*NL*
mother
's
insight
;
she
had
seen
what
she
wished
to
see
.
And
yet
--
and
yet
,
*NL*
now
the
suggestion
had
been
made
to
him
,
he
remembered
so
many
things
,
*NL*
very
slight
things
,
like
the
stirring
of
the
water
by
an
imperceptible
*NL*
breeze
,
which
seemed
to
him
some
confirmation
of
his
mother
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lisbeth
noticed
that
he
was
moved
.
She
went
on
,
``
An

t

nor
thee

`
st.
Thy
eyes
follow
her
about
,
welly
as
Gyp
's
follow
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
could
sit
still
no
longer
.
He
rose
,
took
down
his
hat
,
and
went
out
*NL*
into
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sunshine
was
on
them
:
that
early
autumn
sunshine
which
we
should
*NL*
know
was
not
summer
's
,
even
if
there
were
not
the
touches
of
yellow
*NL*
on
the
lime
and
chestnut
;
the
Sunday
sunshine
too
,
which
has
more
than
*NL*
autumnal
calmness
for
the
working
man
;
the
morning
sunshine
,
which
still
*NL*
leaves
the
dew-crystals
on
the
fine
gossamer
webs
in
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
bushy
hedgerows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
needed
the
calm
influence
;
he
was
amazed
at
the
way
in
which
*NL*
this
new
thought
of
Dinah
's
love
had
taken
possession
of
him
,
with
an
*NL*
overmastering
power
that
made
all
other
feelings
give
way
before
the
*NL*
impetuous
desire
to
know
that
the
thought
was
true
.
Strange
,
that
till
*NL*
that
moment
the
possibility
of
their
ever
being
lovers
had
never
crossed
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
yet
now
,
all
his
longing
suddenly
went
out
towards
that
*NL*
possibility
.
He
had
no
more
doubt
or
hesitation
as
to
his
own
wishes
*NL*
than
the
bird
that
flies
towards
the
opening
through
which
the
daylight
*NL*
gleams
and
the
breath
of
heaven
enters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
autumnal
Sunday
sunshine
soothed
him
,
but
not
by
preparing
him
with
*NL*
resignation
to
the
disappointment
if
his
mother
--
if
he
himself
--
proved
*NL*
to
be
mistaken
about
Dinah
.
It
soothed
him
by
gentle
encouragement
of
*NL*
his
hopes
.
Her
love
was
so
like
that
calm
sunshine
that
they
seemed
to
*NL*
make
one
presence
to
him
,
and
he
believed
in
them
both
alike
.
And
Dinah
*NL*
was
so
bound
up
with
the
sad
memories
of
his
first
passion
that
he
was
*NL*
not
forsaking
them
,
but
rather
giving
them
a
new
sacredness
by
loving
*NL*
her
.
Nay
,
his
love
for
her
had
grown
out
of
that
past
:
it
was
the
noon
*NL*
of
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Seth
?
Would
the
lad
be
hurt
?
Hardly
;
for
he
had
seemed
quite
*NL*
contented
of
late
,
and
there
was
no
selfish
jealousy
in
him
;
he
had
*NL*
never
been
jealous
of
his
mother
's
fondness
for
Adam
.
But
had
he
seen
*NL*
anything
of
what
their
mother
talked
about
?
Adam
longed
to
know
this
,
*NL*
for
he
thought
he
could
trust
Seth
's
observation
better
than
his
*NL*
mother
's
.
He
must
talk
to
Seth
before
he
went
to
see
Dinah
,
and
,
with
*NL*
this
intention
in
his
mind
,
he
walked
back
to
the
cottage
and
said
to
*NL*
his
mother
,
``
Did
Seth
say
anything
to
thee
about
when
he
was
coming
*NL*
home
?
Will
he
be
back
to
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
lad
,
he
'll
be
back
for
a
wonder
.
He
isna
gone
to
Treddles
`
on
.
He
's
*NL*
gone
somewhere
else
a-preachin
'
and
a-prayin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hast
any
notion
which
way
he
's
gone
?
''
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
but
he
aften
goes
to
th
'
Common
.
Thee
know
`
st
more
o
's
goings
nor
*NL*
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
wanted
to
go
and
meet
Seth
,
but
he
must
content
himself
with
*NL*
walking
about
the
near
fields
and
getting
sight
of
him
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
That
would
not
be
for
more
than
an
hour
to
come
,
for
Seth
*NL*
would
scarcely
be
at
home
much
before
their
dinner-time
,
which
was
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
.
But
Adam
could
not
sit
down
to
his
reading
again
,
and
he
*NL*
sauntered
along
by
the
brook
and
stood
leaning
against
the
stiles
,
with
*NL*
eager
intense
eyes
,
which
looked
as
if
they
saw
something
very
vividly
;
*NL*
but
it
was
not
the
brook
or
the
willows
,
not
the
fields
or
the
sky
.
*NL*
Again
and
again
his
vision
was
interrupted
by
wonder
at
the
strength
of
*NL*
his
own
feeling
,
at
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
this
new
love
--
almost
*NL*
like
the
wonder
a
man
feels
at
the
added
power
he
finds
in
himself
for
*NL*
an
art
which
he
had
laid
aside
for
a
space
.
How
is
it
that
the
poets
*NL*
have
said
so
many
fine
things
about
our
first
love
,
so
few
about
our
*NL*
later
love
?
Are
their
first
poems
their
best
?
Or
are
not
those
the
best
*NL*
which
come
from
their
fuller
thought
,
their
larger
experience
,
their
*NL*
deeper-rooted
affections
?
The
boy
's
flutelike
voice
has
its
own
spring
*NL*
charm
;
but
the
man
should
yield
a
richer
deeper
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
there
was
Seth
,
visible
at
the
farthest
stile
,
and
Adam
*NL*
hastened
to
meet
him
.
Seth
was
surprised
,
and
thought
something
unusual
*NL*
must
have
happened
,
but
when
Adam
came
up
,
his
face
said
plainly
enough
*NL*
that
it
was
nothing
alarming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
hast
been
?
''
said
Adam
,
when
they
were
side
by
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
the
Common
,
''
said
Seth
.
``
Dinah
's
been
speaking
the
Word
*NL*
to
a
little
company
of
hearers
at
Brimstone
's
,
as
they
call
him
.
They
're
*NL*
folks
as
never
go
to
church
hardly
--
them
on
the
Common
--
but
they
'll
go
*NL*
and
hear
Dinah
a
bit
.
She
's
been
speaking
with
power
this
forenoon
*NL*
from
the
words
,
'
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
,
but
sinners
to
*NL*
repentance
.
'
And
there
was
a
little
thing
happened
as
was
pretty
to
see
.
*NL*
The
women
mostly
bring
their
children
with
'em
,
but
to-day
there
was
one
*NL*
stout
curly
headed
fellow
about
three
or
four
year
old
,
that
I
never
saw
*NL*
there
before
.
He
was
as
naughty
as
could
be
at
the
beginning
while
I
was
*NL*
praying
,
and
while
we
was
singing
,
but
when
we
all
sat
down
and
Dinah
*NL*
began
to
speak
,
th
'
young
un
stood
stock
still
all
at
once
,
and
began
to
*NL*
look
at
her
with
's
mouth
open
,
and
presently
he
ran
away
from
's
mother
*NL*
and
went
to
Dinah
,
and
pulled
at
her
,
like
a
little
dog
,
for
her
to
take
*NL*
notice
of
him
.
So
Dinah
lifted
him
up
and
held
th
'
lad
on
her
lap
,
while
*NL*
she
went
on
speaking
;
and
he
was
as
good
as
could
be
till
he
went
to
*NL*
sleep
--
and
the
mother
cried
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
she
shouldna
be
a
mother
herself
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
so
fond
as
*NL*
the
children
are
of
her
.
Dost
think
she
's
quite
fixed
against
marrying
,
*NL*
Seth
?
Dost
think
nothing
`
ud
turn
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
peculiar
in
his
brother
's
tone
,
which
made
Seth
*NL*
steal
a
glance
at
his
face
before
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
`
ud
be
wrong
of
me
to
say
nothing
`
ud
turn
her
,
''
he
answered
.
``
But
*NL*
if
thee
mean
`
st
it
about
myself
,
I
've
given
up
all
thoughts
as
she
can
*NL*
ever
be
my
wife
.
She
calls
me
her
brother
,
and
that
's
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dost
think
she
might
ever
get
fond
enough
of
anybody
else
to
be
*NL*
willing
to
marry
'em
?
''
said
Adam
rather
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Seth
,
after
some
hesitation
,
``
it
's
crossed
my
mind
*NL*
sometimes
o
'
late
as
she
might
;
but
Dinah
`
ud
let
no
fondness
for
the
*NL*
creature
draw
her
out
o
'
the
path
as
she
believed
God
had
marked
out
for
*NL*
her
.
If
she
thought
the
leading
was
not
from
Him
,
she
's
not
one
to
*NL*
be
brought
under
the
power
of
it
.
And
she
's
allays
seemed
clear
about
*NL*
that
--
as
her
work
was
to
minister
t
'
others
,
and
make
no
home
for
*NL*
herself
i
'
this
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
,
''
said
Adam
,
earnestly
,
``
suppose
there
was
a
man
as
`
ud
*NL*
let
her
do
just
the
same
and
not
interfere
with
her

she
might
do
a
good
*NL*
deal
o
'
what
she
does
now
,
just
as
well
when
she
was
married
as
when
*NL*
she
was
single
.
Other
women
of
her
sort
have
married
--
that
's
to
say
,
not
*NL*
just
like
her
,
but
women
as
preached
and
attended
on
the
sick
and
needy
.
*NL*
There
's
Mrs.
Fletcher
as
she
talks
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
light
had
broken
in
on
Seth
.
He
turned
round
,
and
laying
his
*NL*
hand
on
Adam
's
shoulder
,
said
,
``
Why
,
wouldst
like
her
to
marry
THEE
,
*NL*
Brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
looked
doubtfully
at
Seth
's
inquiring
eyes
and
said
,
``
Wouldst
be
*NL*
hurt
if
she
was
to
be
fonder
o
'
me
than
o
'
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Seth
warmly
,
``
how
canst
think
it
?
Have
I
felt
thy
trouble
so
*NL*
little
that
I
shouldna
feel
thy
joy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
a
few
moments
as
they
walked
on
,
and
then
Seth
said
,
*NL*
``
I
'd
no
notion
as
thee
`
dst
ever
think
of
her
for
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
o

any
use
to
think
of
her
?
''
said
Adam
.
``
What
dost
say
?
*NL*
Mother
's
made
me
as
I
hardly
know
where
I

with

's
been
*NL*
saying
to

this
forenoon

She
says

feels
for

more
*NL*
than
common
,
and
`

be
willing

But
I
'm
afraid

speaks
*NL*
without

I
want
to
know

seen
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
nice
point
to
speak
about
,
''
said
Seth
,
``
and
I
'm
afraid
o
'
being
*NL*
wrong
;
besides
,
we
've
no
right
t

intermeddle
with
people

feelings
*NL*
when
they
would
n't
tell
'em
themselves

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
thee
mightst
ask
her
,
''
he
said
presently
.
``
She
took
no
offence

t
not

But
Dinah
does
n't
hold
wi

them
as
are
for
keeping
the
Society
*NL*
so
strict
to
themselves

She
does

so
as
they
're
fit

enter
the

Some
o

the

at

with
her
for
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
will
she
be
the
rest
o

the
day
?

said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
should
n't
leave
the
farm
again
to-day

said
Seth
,
*NL*
``
because

*NL*
*NL*
Adam
thought
--
but
did
not

--
``
Then
I

Chapter
LII
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
and
Dinah
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
about
three
o'clock
when
Adam
entered
the
farmyard
and
roused
*NL*
Alick
and
the
dogs
from
their
Sunday
dozing
.
Alick
said
everybody
was
*NL*
gone
to
church
``
but
th
'
young
missis
''
--
so
he
called
Dinah
--
but
this
*NL*
did
not
disappoint
Adam
,
although
the
``
everybody
''
was
so
liberal
as
*NL*
to
include
Nancy
the
dairymaid
,
whose
works
of
necessity
were
not
*NL*
unfrequently
incompatible
with
church-going
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
perfect
stillness
about
the
house
.
The
doors
were
all
closed
,
*NL*
and
the
very
stones
and
tubs
seemed
quieter
than
usual
.
Adam
heard
the
*NL*
water
gently
dripping
from
the
pump
--
that
was
the
only
sound
--
and
*NL*
he
knocked
at
the
house
door
rather
softly
,
as
was
suitable
in
that
*NL*
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
Dinah
stood
before
him
,
colouring
deeply
with
the
*NL*
great
surprise
of
seeing
Adam
at
this
hour
,
when
she
knew
it
was
his
*NL*
regular
practice
to
be
at
church
.
Yesterday
he
would
have
said
to
her
*NL*
without
any
difficulty
,
``
I
came
to
see
you
,
Dinah
:
I
knew
the
rest
were
*NL*
not
at
home
.
''
But
to-day
something
prevented
him
from
saying
that
,
and
*NL*
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
in
silence
.
Neither
of
them
spoke
,
and
yet
*NL*
both
wished
they
could
speak
,
as
Adam
entered
,
and
they
sat
down
.
Dinah
*NL*
took
the
chair
she
had
just
left
;
it
was
at
the
corner
of
the
table
*NL*
near
the
window
,
and
there
was
a
book
lying
on
the
table
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
open
.
She
had
been
sitting
perfectly
still
,
looking
at
the
small
bit
*NL*
of
clear
fire
in
the
bright
grate
.
Adam
sat
down
opposite
her
,
in
Mr.
*NL*
Poyser
's
three-cornered
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
is
not
ill
again
,
I
hope
,
Adam
?
''
Dinah
said
,
recovering
*NL*
herself
.
``
Seth
said
she
was
well
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
very
hearty
to-day
,
''
said
Adam
,
happy
in
the
signs
of
Dinah
's
*NL*
feeling
at
the
sight
of
him
,
but
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nobody
at
home
,
you
see
,
''
Dinah
said
;
``
but
you
'll
wait
.
You
've
*NL*
been
hindered
from
going
to
church
to-day
,
doubtless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Adam
said
,
and
then
paused
,
before
he
added
,
``
I
was
thinking
*NL*
about
you
:
that
was
the
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
confession
was
very
awkward
and
sudden
,
Adam
felt
,
for
he
thought
*NL*
Dinah
must
understand
all
he
meant
.
But
the
frankness
of
the
words
*NL*
caused
her
immediately
to
interpret
them
into
a
renewal
of
his
brotherly
*NL*
regrets
that
she
was
going
away
,
and
she
answered
calmly
,
``
Do
not
be
*NL*
careful
and
troubled
for
me
,
Adam
.
I
have
all
things
and
abound
at
*NL*
Snowfield
.
And
my
mind
is
at
rest
,
for
I
am
not
seeking
my
own
will
in
*NL*
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
things
were
different
,
Dinah
,
''
said
Adam
,
hesitatingly
.
``
If
you
*NL*
knew
things
that
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
looked
at
him
inquiringly
,
but
instead
of
going
on
,
he
reached
a
*NL*
chair
and
brought
it
near
the
corner
of
the
table
where
she
was
sitting
.
*NL*
She
wondered
,
and
was
afraid
--
and
the
next
moment
her
thoughts
flew
to
*NL*
the
past
:
was
it
something
about
those
distant
unhappy
ones
that
she
*NL*
did
n't
know
?
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
looked
at
her
.
It
was
so
sweet
to
look
at
her
eyes
,
which
had
now
*NL*
a
self-forgetful
questioning
in
them
--
for
a
moment
he
forgot
that
he
*NL*
wanted
to
say
anything
,
or
that
it
was
necessary
to
tell
her
what
he
*NL*
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinah
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
taking
both
her
hands
between
his
,
``
I
love
*NL*
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
.
I
love
you
next
to
God
who
made
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
's
lips
became
pale
,
like
her
cheeks
,
and
she
trembled
violently
*NL*
under
the
shock
of
painful
joy
.
Her
hands
were
cold
as
death
between
*NL*
Adam
's
.
She
could
not
draw
them
away
,
because
he
held
them
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
you
ca
n't
love
me
,
Dinah
.
Do
n't
tell
me
we
must
part
and
*NL*
pass
our
lives
away
from
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
were
trembling
in
Dinah
's
eyes
,
and
they
fell
before
she
could
*NL*
answer
.
But
she
spoke
in
a
quiet
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
Adam
,
we
must
submit
to
another
Will
.
We
must
part
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
love
me
,
Dinah
--
not
if
you
love
me

said
passionately
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
--
tell
me
if
you
can
love
me
better
than

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
was
too
entirely
reliant
on
the
Supreme
guidance
to
attempt
to
*NL*
achieve
any
end
by
a
deceptive
concealment
.
She
was
recovering
now
from
*NL*
the
first
shock
of
emotion
,
and
she
looked
at
Adam
with
simple
sincere
*NL*
eyes
as
she
said
,
``
Yes
,
Adam
,
my
heart
is
drawn
strongly
towards
you
;
*NL*
and
of
my
own
will
,
if
I
had
no
clear
showing
to
the
contrary
,
I
could
*NL*
find
my
happiness
in
being
near
you
and
ministering
to
you
continually
.
*NL*
I
fear
I
should
forget
to
rejoice
and
weep
with
others
;
nay
,
I
fear
I
*NL*
should
forget
the
Divine
presence
,
and
seek
no
love

yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
did
not
speak
immediately
.
They
sat
looking
at
each
other
in
*NL*
delicious
silence
--
for
the
first
sense
of
mutual
love
excludes
other
*NL*
feelings
;
it
will
have
the
soul
all
to
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Dinah
,
''
Adam
said
at
last
,
``
how
can
there
be
anything
contrary
*NL*
to
what
's
right
in

belonging

one
another

lives

together

Who
put
this
great

into

Can
anything
be
*NL*
holier
than
that

For
we
can
help
one
another
in
everything
as
is
good

*NL*
I
'd
never
think

putting
myself
between
you

saying
you

*NL*
``
Yes

Dinah
said
,
``
I
know
marriage
is
a
holy
state
for
those
who
*NL*
are
truly
called

it

and
have
no

drawing
;
but
from
my
childhood
*NL*
upwards
I
have
been
led
towards
another
path

all
my
peace

my
joy

have
come
from

no

living
only
in

very
blessed
years

feel
that

aside

has
shone
upon

We
could
not

there
were
doubts
in
my
soul

if
I
yearned

when
it
was
too
late

after
that
better

once
been

had
put
away
from

to
be
willing

be
nearer

is
n't
that
*NL*
a
sign
that
it
's
right
for
you
to
change
your

make
it
right
when
nothing
else
would
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
my
mind
is
full
of
questionings
about
that
;
for
now
,
since
you
*NL*
tell
me
of
your
strong
love
towards
me
,
what
was
clear
to
me
has
become
*NL*
dark
again
.
I
felt
before
that
my
heart
was
too
strongly
drawn
towards
*NL*
you
,
and
that
your
heart
was
not
as
mine
;
and
the
thought
of
you
had
*NL*
taken
hold
of
me
,
so
that
my
soul
had
lost
its
freedom
,
and
was
becoming
*NL*
enslaved
to
an
earthly
affection
,
which
made
me
anxious
and
careful
*NL*
about
what
should
befall
myself
.
For
in
all
other
affection
I
had
been
*NL*
content
with
any
small
return
,
or
with
none
;
but
my
heart
was
beginning
*NL*
to
hunger
after
an
equal
love
from
you
.
And
I
had
no
doubt
that
I
must
*NL*
wrestle
against
that
as
a
great
temptation
,
and
the
command
was
clear
*NL*
that
I
must
go
away
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now

*NL*
``
Adam

you

hard

a
*NL*
great
fear
is
upon

come

standing

I
have

again

again
when
I
have

in
stillness

darkness

Dinah
had
closed
her

went
through
her
.
``

she
went
on
,

shut
up

it
's
only
adding
to
what
you

not

away
from

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
was
silent
;
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
contemplation
of
something
*NL*
visible
only
to
herself
.
Adam
went
on
presently
with
his
pleading
,
``
And
*NL*
you
can
do
almost
as
much
as

do
now

I
wo

to
church
*NL*
with
me
of
a
Sunday

You
shall
go
where
you
like
among
the
people

and
*NL*
teach
'em
;
for
though
I
like
church
best
,
I
do
n't
put
my
soul
above

yours

my
words
was
better

you
can
help
the
sick
just
as
much

you
'll
have
more

means

making
'em
a

comfortable

you
'll
be
among
all

love
you

can
help
'em

be
a
blessing
to
'em
till

their
dying
day

Surely
,
Dinah
,
you
'd
be
as
near
to
God
as
if
you
was
*NL*
living
lonely
and
away
from

*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
made
no
answer
for
some
time
.
Adam
was
still
holding
her
hands
and
*NL*
looking
at
her
with
almost
trembling
anxiety
,
when
she
turned
her
grave
*NL*
loving
eyes
on
his
and
said
,
in
rather
a
sad
voice
,
``
Adam
there
is
truth

in
what
you
say

there
's
many
of
the
brethren

have
*NL*
greater
strength
than
I
have
,
and
find
their
hearts
enlarged
by
the
*NL*
cares
of
husband
and
kindred
.
But
I
have
not
faith
that
it
would
be
so
*NL*
with
me
,
for
since
my
affections
have
been
set
above
measure
on
you

I
*NL*
have
had
less
peace

joy
in
God

I
have
felt
as
it
were
a
division
*NL*
in
my
heart
.
And
think
how
it
is
with
me
,
Adam
.
That
life
I
have
led
is
*NL*
like
a
land
I
have
trodden
in
blessedness
since
my
childhood
;
and
if
*NL*
I
long
for
a
moment
to
follow
the
voice
which
calls
me
to
another
land

I

not

I
can
not

fear
that
my
soul
might
hereafter
yearn

for
that
early
blessedness
which
I
had
forsaken
;

where
doubt
enters
*NL*
there
is
not
perfect
love

I
must
wait
for
clearer
guidance

I
must
go
*NL*
from
you

we
must
submit
ourselves
entirely
to
the
Divine
Will

are
sometimes
required
to
lay
our
natural
lawful
affections
on
the

altar

Adam
dared
not
plead
again

was
not
the
voice

caprice
or
*NL*
insincerity

But
it
was
very
hard
for
him
;
his
eyes
got
dim
as
he
looked
*NL*
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you

come

They
went
out
and
walked
towards
the
fields

where
they
would
meet

from

Adam
said

feathers

I
love
her
next
to
my
own

An
'
she
makes
one
feel
*NL*
safer
when
she
's
i
'
the
house
,
for
she
's
like
the
driven
snow
:
anybody
*NL*
might
sin
for
two
as
had
her
at
their
elbow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinah

''
said
Tommy
,
running
forward
to
meet
her
,
``
mother
says
you
'll
*NL*
never
marry
anybody
but
a
Methodist
cripple
.
What
a
silly
you
must
be
!
''
*NL*
a
comment
which
Tommy
followed
up
by
seizing
Dinah
with
both
arms
,
and
*NL*
dancing
along
by
her
side
with
incommodious
fondness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Adam
,
we
missed
you
i
'
the
singing
to-day
,
''
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
How
*NL*
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
see
Dinah
--
she
's
going
away
so
soon

said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
lad
!
Can
you
persuade
her
to
stop
somehow
?
Find
her
a
good

the
parish

If
you
'll
do
that
,
we
'll
forgive
you
for

missing

But
,
anyway
,
she
isna
going

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

said
Adam
,
``
I
'll
come
if
I
can

But
I
ca
n't
often
say
what
I

for
the
work
often
holds
me
longer
than
I

the
end

the
week

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes

said
Mr.
Poyser
.
``
We
'll
have
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
no
call

observed
Mrs.

.
``
Scarceness
*NL*

keep
:
there
's
no
need
to

.
An

*NL*
scarceness
is
what
there
's
the
biggest
stock
of
i
'
that
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
smiled
,
but
gave
no
promise
to
stay
,
and
they
talked
of
other
*NL*
things
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
,
lingering
in
the
sunshine
to
look
*NL*
at
the
great
flock
of
geese
grazing
,
at
the
new
corn-ricks
,
and
at
the
*NL*
surprising
abundance
of
fruit
on
the
old
pear-tree
;
Nancy
and
Molly
*NL*
having
already
hastened
home
,
side
by
side
,
each
holding
,
carefully
*NL*
wrapped
in
her
pocket-handkerchief
,
a
prayer-book
,
in
which
she
could
*NL*
read
little
beyond
the
large
letters
and
the
Amens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
all
other
leisure
is
hurry
compared
with
a
sunny
walk
through
the
*NL*
fields
from
``
afternoon
church
''
--
as
such
walks
used
to
be
in
those
old
*NL*
leisurely
times
,
when
the
boat
,
gliding
sleepily
along
the
canal
,
was
*NL*
the
newest
locomotive
wonder
;
when
Sunday
books
had
most
of
them
old
*NL*
brown-leather
covers
,
and
opened
with
remarkable
precision
always
in
one
*NL*
place
.
Leisure
is
gone
--
gone
where
the
spinning-wheels
are
gone
,
and
the
*NL*
pack-horses
,
and
the
slow
waggons
,
and
the
pedlars
,
who
brought
bargains
*NL*
to
the
door
on
sunny
afternoons
.
Ingenious
philosophers
tell
you
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
the
great
work
of
the
steam-engine
is
to
create
leisure
*NL*
for
mankind
.
Do
not
believe
them
:
it
only
creates
a
vacuum
for
eager
*NL*
thought
to
rush
in
.
Even
idleness
is
eager
now
--
eager
for
amusement
;
*NL*
prone
to
excursion-trains
,
art
museums
,
periodical
literature
,
and
*NL*
exciting
novels
;
prone
even
to
scientific
theorizing
and
cursory
peeps
*NL*
through
microscopes
.
Old
Leisure
was
quite
a
different
personage
.
He
*NL*
only
read
one
newspaper
,
innocent
of
leaders
,
and
was
free
from
*NL*
that
periodicity
of
sensations
which
we
call
post-time
.
He
was
a
*NL*
contemplative
,
rather
stout
gentleman
,
of
excellent
digestion
;
of
quiet
*NL*
perceptions
,
undiseased
by
hypothesis
;
happy
in
his
inability
to
know
*NL*
the
causes
of
things
,
preferring
the
things
themselves
.
He
lived
chiefly
*NL*
in
the
country
,
among
pleasant
seats
and
homesteads
,
and
was
fond
of
*NL*
sauntering
by
the
fruit-tree
wall
and
scenting
the
apricots
when
they
*NL*
were
warmed
by
the
morning
sunshine
,
or
of
sheltering
himself
under
*NL*
the
orchard
boughs
at
noon
,
when
the
summer
pears
were
falling
.
He
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
weekday
services
,
and
thought
none
the
worse
of
the
Sunday
*NL*
sermon
if
it
allowed
him
to
sleep
from
the
text
to
the
blessing
;
liking
*NL*
the
afternoon
service
best
,
because
the
prayers
were
the
shortest
,
*NL*
and
not
ashamed
to
say
so
;
for
he
had
an
easy
,
jolly
conscience
,
*NL*
broad-backed
like
himself
,
and
able
to
carry
a
great
deal
of
beer
or
*NL*
port-wine
,
not
being
made
squeamish
by
doubts
and
qualms
and
lofty
*NL*
aspirations
.
Life
was
not
a
task
to
him
,
but
a
sinecure
.
He
fingered
the
*NL*
guineas
in
his
pocket
,
and
ate
his
dinners
,
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
*NL*
irresponsible
,
for
had
he
not
kept
up
his
character
by
going
to
church
*NL*
on
the
Sunday
afternoons
?
*NL*
*NL*
Fine
old
Leisure
!
Do
not
be
severe
upon
him
,
and
judge
him
by
our
modern
*NL*
standard
.
He
never
went
to
Exeter
Hall
,
or
heard
a
popular
preacher
,
or
*NL*
read
Tracts
for
the
Times
or
Sartor
Resartus
.

The
Harvest
Supper
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Adam
was
going
homeward
,
on
Wednesday
evening
,
in
the
six
o'clock
*NL*
sunlight
,
he
saw
in
the
distance
the
last
load
of
barley
winding
its
way
*NL*
towards
the
yard-gate
of
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
heard
the
chant
of
``
Harvest
*NL*
Home
!
''
rising
and
sinking
like
a
wave
.
Fainter
and
fainter
,
and
more
*NL*
musical
through
the
growing
distance
,
the
falling
dying
sound
still
*NL*
reached
him
,
as
he
neared
the
Willow
Brook
.
The
low
westering
sun
shone
*NL*
right
on
the
shoulders
of
the
old
Binton
Hills
,
turning
the
unconscious
*NL*
sheep
into
bright
spots
of
light
;
shone
on
the
windows
of
the
cottage
*NL*
too
,
and
made
them
a-flame
with
a
glory
beyond
that
of
amber
or
*NL*
amethyst
.
It
was
enough
to
make
Adam
feel
that
he
was
in
a
great
temple
,
*NL*
and
that
the
distant
chant
was
a
sacred
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
,
''
he
thought
,
``
how
that
sound
goes
to
one
's
heart
almost
*NL*
like
a
funeral
bell
,
for
all
it
tells
one
o
'
the
joyfullest
time
o
'
the
*NL*
year
,
and
the
time
when
men
are
mostly
the
thankfullest
.
I
suppose
it
's
*NL*
a
bit
hard
to
us
to
think
anything
's
over
and
gone
in
our
lives
;
and
*NL*
there
's
a
parting
at
the
root
of
all
our
joys
.
It
's
like
what
I
feel
*NL*
about
Dinah
.
I
should
never
ha
'
come
to
know
that
her
love
`
ud
be
the
*NL*
greatest
o
'
blessings
to
me
,
if
what
I
counted
a
blessing
had
n't
been
*NL*
wrenched
and
torn
away
from
me
,
and
left
me
with
a
greater
need
,
so
as
I
*NL*
could
crave
and
hunger
for
a
greater
and
a
better
comfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
expected
to
see
Dinah
again
this
evening
,
and
get
leave
to
accompany
*NL*
her
as
far
as
Oakbourne
;
and
then
he
would
ask
her
to
fix
some
time
when
*NL*
he
might
go
to
Snowfield
,
and
learn
whether
the
last
best
hope
that
had
*NL*
been
born
to
him
must
be
resigned
like
the
rest
.
The
work
he
had
to
do
*NL*
at
home
,
besides
putting
on
his
best
clothes
,
made
it
seven
before
he
*NL*
was
on
his
way
again
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
it
was
questionable
whether
,
*NL*
with
his
longest
and
quickest
strides
,
he
should
be
there
in
time
even
*NL*
for
the
roast
beef
,
which
came
after
the
plum
pudding
,
for
Mrs.
Poyser
's
*NL*
supper
would
be
punctual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
was
the
clatter
of
knives
and
pewter
plates
and
tin
cans
when
Adam
*NL*
entered
the
house
,
but
there
was
no
hum
of
voices
to
this
accompaniment
:
*NL*
the
eating
of
excellent
roast
beef
,
provided
free
of
expense
,
was
too
*NL*
serious
a
business
to
those
good
farm-labourers
to
be
performed
with
*NL*
a
divided
attention
,
even
if
they
had
had
anything
to
say
to
each
*NL*
other
--
which
they
had
not
.
And
Mr.
Poyser
,
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
was
*NL*
too
busy
with
his
carving
to
listen
to
Bartle
Massey
's
or
Mr.
Craig
's
*NL*
ready
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Adam
,
''
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
standing
and
looking
on
to
see
*NL*
that
Molly
and
Nancy
did
their
duty
as
waiters
,
``
here
's
a
place
kept
for
*NL*
you
between
Mr.
Massey
and
the
boys
.
It
's
a
poor
tale
you
could
n't
come
*NL*
to
see
the
pudding
when
it
was
whole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
looked
anxiously
round
for
a
fourth
woman
's
figure
,
but
Dinah
*NL*
was
not
there
.
He
was
almost
afraid
of
asking
about
her
;
besides
,
his
*NL*
attention
was
claimed
by
greetings
,
and
there
remained
the
hope
that
*NL*
Dinah
was
in
the
house
,
though
perhaps
disinclined
to
festivities
on
the
*NL*
eve
of
her
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
goodly
sight
--
that
table
,
with
Martin
Poyser
's
round
*NL*
good-humoured
face
and
large
person
at
the
head
of
it
helping
his
*NL*
servants
to
the
fragrant
roast
beef
and
pleased
when
the
empty
plates
*NL*
came
again
.
Martin
,
though
usually
blest
with
a
good
appetite
,
really
*NL*
forgot
to
finish
his
own
beef
to-night
--
it
was
so
pleasant
to
him
to
*NL*
look
on
in
the
intervals
of
carving
and
see
how
the
others
enjoyed
their
*NL*
supper
;
for
were
they
not
men
who
,
on
all
the
days
of
the
year
except
*NL*
Christmas
Day
and
Sundays
,
ate
their
cold
dinner
,
in
a
makeshift
manner
,
*NL*
under
the
hedgerows
,
and
drank
their
beer
out
of
wooden
bottles
--
with
*NL*
relish
certainly
,
but
with
their
mouths
towards
the
zenith
,
after
a
*NL*
fashion
more
endurable
to
ducks
than
to
human
bipeds
.
Martin
Poyser
had
*NL*
some
faint
conception
of
the
flavour
such
men
must
find
in
hot
roast
*NL*
beef
and
fresh-drawn
ale
.
He
held
his
head
on
one
side
and
screwed
*NL*
up
his
mouth
,
as
he
nudged
Bartle
Massey
,
and
watched
half-witted
Tom
*NL*
Tholer
,
otherwise
known
as
``
Tom
Saft
,
''
receiving
his
second
plateful
of
*NL*
beef
.
A
grin
of
delight
broke
over
Tom
's
face
as
the
plate
was
set
down
*NL*
before
him
,
between
his
knife
and
fork
,
which
he
held
erect
,
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
sacred
tapers
.
But
the
delight
was
too
strong
to
continue
*NL*
smouldering
in
a
grin
--
it
burst
out
the
next
instant
in
a
long-drawn
*NL*
``
haw
,
haw
!
''
followed
by
a
sudden
collapse
into
utter
gravity
,
as
the
*NL*
knife
and
fork
darted
down
on
the
prey
.
Martin
Poyser
's
large
person
*NL*
shook
with
his
silent
unctuous
laugh
.
He
turned
towards
Mrs.
Poyser
to
*NL*
see
if
she
too
had
been
observant
of
Tom
,
and
the
eyes
of
husband
and
*NL*
wife
met
in
a
glance
of
good-natured
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
Saft
''
was
a
great
favourite
on
the
farm
,
where
he
played
the
part
*NL*
of
the
old
jester
,
and
made
up
for
his
practical
deficiencies
by
his
*NL*
success
in
repartee
.
His
hits
,
I
imagine
,
were
those
of
the
flail
,
which
*NL*
falls
quite
at
random
,
but
nevertheless
smashes
an
insect
now
and
then
.
*NL*
They
were
much
quoted
at
sheep-shearing
and
haymaking
times
,
but
I
*NL*
refrain
from
recording
them
here
,
lest
Tom
's
wit
should
prove
to
be
*NL*
like
that
of
many
other
bygone
jesters
eminent
in
their
day
--
rather
of
a
*NL*
temporary
nature
,
not
dealing
with
the
deeper
and
more
lasting
relations
*NL*
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
excepted
,
Martin
Poyser
had
some
pride
in
his
servants
and
*NL*
labourers
,
thinking
with
satisfaction
that
they
were
the
best
worth
*NL*
their
pay
of
any
set
on
the
estate
.
There
was
Kester
Bale
,
for
example
*NL*
-LRB-
Beale
,
probably
,
if
the
truth
were
known
,
but
he
was
called
Bale
,
and
*NL*
was
not
conscious
of
any
claim
to
a
fifth
letter
-RRB-
,
the
old
man
with
the
*NL*
close
leather
cap
and
the
network
of
wrinkles
on
his
sun-browned
face
.
*NL*
Was
there
any
man
in
Loamshire
who
knew
better
the
``
natur
''
of
all
*NL*
farming
work
?
He
was
one
of
those
invaluable
labourers
who
can
not
only
*NL*
turn
their
hand
to
everything
,
but
excel
in
everything
they
turn
their
*NL*
hand
to
.
It
is
true
Kester
's
knees
were
much
bent
outward
by
this
time
,
*NL*
and
he
walked
with
a
perpetual
curtsy
,
as
if
he
were
among
the
most
*NL*
reverent
of
men
.
And
so
he
was
;
but
I
am
obliged
to
admit
that
the
*NL*
object
of
his
reverence
was
his
own
skill
,
towards
which
he
performed
*NL*
some
rather
affecting
acts
of
worship
.
He
always
thatched
the
ricks
--
for
*NL*
if
anything
were
his
forte
more
than
another
,
it
was
thatching
--
and
when
*NL*
the
last
touch
had
been
put
to
the
last
beehive
rick
,
Kester
,
whose
home
*NL*
lay
at
some
distance
from
the
farm
,
would
take
a
walk
to
the
rick-yard
*NL*
in
his
best
clothes
on
a
Sunday
morning
and
stand
in
the
lane
,
at
a
due
*NL*
distance
,
to
contemplate
his
own
thatching
,
walking
about
to
get
each
*NL*
rick
from
the
proper
point
of
view
.
As
he
curtsied
along
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
upturned
to
the
straw
knobs
imitative
of
golden
globes
at
the
summits
*NL*
of
the
beehive
ricks
,
which
indeed
were
gold
of
the
best
sort
,
you
might
*NL*
have
imagined
him
to
be
engaged
in
some
pagan
act
of
adoration
.
*NL*
Kester
was
an
old
bachelor
and
reputed
to
have
stockings
full
of
coin
,
*NL*
concerning
which
his
master
cracked
a
joke
with
him
every
pay-night
:
*NL*
not
a
new
unseasoned
joke
,
but
a
good
old
one
,
that
had
been
tried
*NL*
many
times
before
and
had
worn
well
.
``
Th
'
young
measter
's
a
merry
mon
,
''
*NL*
Kester
frequently
remarked
;
for
having
begun
his
career
by
frightening
*NL*
away
the
crows
under
the
last
Martin
Poyser
but
one
,
he
could
never
*NL*
cease
to
account
the
reigning
Martin
a
young
master
.
I
am
not
ashamed
*NL*
of
commemorating
old
Kester
.
You
and
I
are
indebted
to
the
hard
hands
of
*NL*
such
men
--
hands
that
have
long
ago
mingled
with
the
soil
they
tilled
so
*NL*
faithfully
,
thriftily
making
the
best
they
could
of
the
earth
's
fruits
,
*NL*
and
receiving
the
smallest
share
as
their
own
wages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
opposite
his
master
,
there
was
Alick
,
the
*NL*
shepherd
and
head-man
,
with
the
ruddy
face
and
broad
shoulders
,
not
on
*NL*
the
best
terms
with
old
Kester
;
indeed
,
their
intercourse
was
confined
*NL*
to
an
occasional
snarl
,
for
though
they
probably
differed
little
*NL*
concerning
hedging
and
ditching
and
the
treatment
of
ewes
,
there
was
a
*NL*
profound
difference
of
opinion
between
them
as
to
their
own
respective
*NL*
merits
.
When
Tityrus
and
Meliboeus
happen
to
be
on
the
same
farm
,
they
*NL*
are
not
sentimentally
polite
to
each
other
.
Alick
,
indeed
,
was
not
by
*NL*
any
means
a
honeyed
man
.
His
speech
had
usually
something
of
a
snarl
*NL*
in
it
,
and
his
broad-shouldered
aspect
something
of
the
bull-dog
*NL*
expression
--
``
Do
n't
you
meddle
with
me
,
and
I
wo
n't
meddle
with
you
.
''
But
*NL*
he
was
honest
even
to
the
splitting
of
an
oat-grain
rather
than
he
*NL*
would
take
beyond
his
acknowledged
share
,
and
as
``
close-fisted
''
with
*NL*
his
master
's
property
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
--
throwing
very
small
*NL*
handfuls
of
damaged
barley
to
the
chickens
,
because
a
large
handful
*NL*
affected
his
imagination
painfully
with
a
sense
of
profusion
.
*NL*
Good-tempered
Tim
,
the
waggoner
,
who
loved
his
horses
,
had
his
grudge
*NL*
against
Alick
in
the
matter
of
corn
.
They
rarely
spoke
to
each
other
,
*NL*
and
never
looked
at
each
other
,
even
over
their
dish
of
cold
potatoes
;
*NL*
but
then
,
as
this
was
their
usual
mode
of
behaviour
towards
all
mankind
,
*NL*
it
would
be
an
unsafe
conclusion
that
they
had
more
than
transient
fits
*NL*
of
unfriendliness
.
The
bucolic
character
at
Hayslope
,
you
perceive
,
*NL*
was
not
of
that
entirely
genial
,
merry
,
broad-grinning
sort
,
apparently
*NL*
observed
in
most
districts
visited
by
artists
.
The
mild
radiance
of
a
*NL*
smile
was
a
rare
sight
on
a
field-labourer
's
face
,
and
there
was
seldom
*NL*
any
gradation
between
bovine
gravity
and
a
laugh
.
Nor
was
every
labourer
*NL*
so
honest
as
our
friend
Alick
.
At
this
very
table
,
among
Mr.
Poyser
's
*NL*
men
,
there
is
that
big
Ben
Tholoway
,
a
very
powerful
thresher
,
but
*NL*
detected
more
than
once
in
carrying
away
his
master
's
corn
in
his
*NL*
pockets
--
an
action
which
,
as
Ben
was
not
a
philosopher
,
could
hardly
be
*NL*
ascribed
to
absence
of
mind
.
However
,
his
master
had
forgiven
him
,
and
*NL*
continued
to
employ
him
,
for
the
Tholoways
had
lived
on
the
Common
time
*NL*
out
of
mind
,
and
had
always
worked
for
the
Poysers
.
And
on
the
whole
,
I
*NL*
daresay
,
society
was
not
much
the
worse
because
Ben
had
not
six
months
*NL*
of
it
at
the
treadmill
,
for
his
views
of
depredation
were
narrow
,
and
*NL*
the
House
of
Correction
might
have
enlarged
them
.
As
it
was
,
Ben
ate
his
*NL*
roast
beef
to-night
with
a
serene
sense
of
having
stolen
nothing
more
*NL*
than
a
few
peas
and
beans
as
seed
for
his
garden
since
the
last
harvest
*NL*
supper
,
and
felt
warranted
in
thinking
that
Alick
's
suspicious
eye
,
for
*NL*
ever
upon
him
,
was
an
injury
to
his
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
NOW
the
roast
beef
was
finished
and
the
cloth
was
drawn
,
leaving
*NL*
a
fair
large
deal
table
for
the
bright
drinking-cans
,
and
the
foaming
*NL*
brown
jugs
,
and
the
bright
brass
candlesticks
,
pleasant
to
behold
.
NOW
,
*NL*
the
great
ceremony
of
the
evening
was
to
begin
--
the
harvest-song
,
*NL*
in
which
every
man
must
join
.
He
might
be
in
tune
,
if
he
liked
to
be
*NL*
singular
,
but
he
must
not
sit
with
closed
lips
.
The
movement
was
obliged
*NL*
to
be
in
triple
time
;
the
rest
was
ad
libitum
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
origin
of
this
song
--
whether
it
came
in
its
actual
state
from
*NL*
the
brain
of
a
single
rhapsodist
,
or
was
gradually
perfected
by
a
school
*NL*
or
succession
of
rhapsodists
,
I
am
ignorant
.
There
is
a
stamp
of
*NL*
unity
,
of
individual
genius
upon
it
,
which
inclines
me
to
the
former
*NL*
hypothesis
,
though
I
am
not
blind
to
the
consideration
that
this
unity
*NL*
may
rather
have
arisen
from
that
consensus
of
many
minds
which
was
a
*NL*
condition
of
primitive
thought
,
foreign
to
our
modern
consciousness
.
*NL*
Some
will
perhaps
think
that
they
detect
in
the
first
quatrain
*NL*
an
indication
of
a
lost
line
,
which
later
rhapsodists
,
failing
in
*NL*
imaginative
vigour
,
have
supplied
by
the
feeble
device
of
iteration
.
*NL*
Others
,
however
,
may
rather
maintain
that
this
very
iteration
is
an
*NL*
original
felicity
,
to
which
none
but
the
most
prosaic
minds
can
be
*NL*
insensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ceremony
connected
with
the
song
was
a
drinking
ceremony
.
-LRB-
That
*NL*
is
perhaps
a
painful
fact
,
but
then
,
you
know
,
we
can
not
reform
our
*NL*
forefathers
.
-RRB-
During
the
first
and
second
quatrain
,
sung
decidedly
*NL*
forte
,
no
can
was
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
's
a
health
unto
our
master
,
*NL*
The
founder
of
the
feast
;
*NL*
Here
's
a
health
unto
our
master
*NL*
And
to
our
mistress
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
may
his
doings
prosper
,
*NL*
Whate'er
he
takes
in
hand
,
*NL*
For
we
are
all
his
servants
,
*NL*
And
are
at
his
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
immediately
before
the
third
quatrain
or
chorus
,
sung
*NL*
fortissimo
,
with
emphatic
raps
of
the
table
,
which
gave
the
effect
of
*NL*
cymbals
and
drum
together
,
Alick
's
can
was
filled
,
and
he
was
bound
to
*NL*
empty
it
before
the
chorus
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
*NL*
And
see
ye
do
not
spill
,
*NL*
For
if
ye
do
,
ye
shall
drink
two
,
*NL*
For
't
is
our
master
's
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alick
had
gone
successfully
through
this
test
of
steady-handed
*NL*
manliness
,
it
was
the
turn
of
old
Kester
,
at
his
right
hand
--
and
so
on
,
*NL*
till
every
man
had
drunk
his
initiatory
pint
under
the
stimulus
of
the
*NL*
chorus
.
Tom
Saft
--
the
rogue
--
took
care
to
spill
a
little
by
accident
;
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Poyser
-LRB-
too
officiously
,
Tom
thought
-RRB-
interfered
to
prevent
the
*NL*
exaction
of
the
penalty
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
any
listener
outside
the
door
it
would
have
been
the
reverse
of
*NL*
obvious
why
the
``
Drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
''
should
have
such
an
immediate
and
*NL*
often-repeated
encore
;
but
once
entered
,
he
would
have
seen
that
all
*NL*
faces
were
at
present
sober
,
and
most
of
them
serious
--
it
was
the
*NL*
regular
and
respectable
thing
for
those
excellent
farm-labourers
to
do
,
*NL*
as
much
as
for
elegant
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
smirk
and
bow
over
their
*NL*
wine-glasses
.
Bartle
Massey
,
whose
ears
were
rather
sensitive
,
had
*NL*
gone
out
to
see
what
sort
of
evening
it
was
at
an
early
stage
in
the
*NL*
ceremony
,
and
had
not
finished
his
contemplation
until
a
silence
of
*NL*
five
minutes
declared
that
``
Drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
''
was
not
likely
to
*NL*
begin
again
for
the
next
twelvemonth
.
Much
to
the
regret
of
the
boys
*NL*
and
Totty
:
on
them
the
stillness
fell
rather
flat
,
after
that
glorious
*NL*
thumping
of
the
table
,
towards
which
Totty
,
seated
on
her
father
's
knee
,
*NL*
contributed
with
her
small
might
and
small
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Bartle
re-entered
,
however
,
there
appeared
to
be
a
general
desire
*NL*
for
solo
music
after
the
choral
.
Nancy
declared
that
Tim
the
waggoner
*NL*
knew
a
song
and
was
``
allays
singing
like
a
lark
i
'
the
stable
,
''
*NL*
whereupon
Mr.
Poyser
said
encouragingly
,
``
Come
,
Tim
,
lad
,
let
's
hear
*NL*
it
.
''
Tim
looked
sheepish
,
tucked
down
his
head
,
and
said
he
could
n't
*NL*
sing
,
but
this
encouraging
invitation
of
the
master
's
was
echoed
all
*NL*
round
the
table
.
It
was
a
conversational
opportunity
:
everybody
could
*NL*
say
,
``
Come
,
Tim
,
''
except
Alick
,
who
never
relaxed
into
the
frivolity
of
*NL*
unnecessary
speech
.
At
last
,
Tim
's
next
neighbour
,
Ben
Tholoway
,
began
*NL*
to
give
emphasis
to
his
speech
by
nudges
,
at
which
Tim
,
growing
rather
*NL*
savage
,
said
,
``
Let
me
alooan
,
will
ye
?
Else
I
'll
ma
'
ye
sing
a
toon
ye
*NL*
wonna
like
.
''
A
good-tempered
waggoner
's
patience
has
limits
,
and
Tim
was
*NL*
not
to
be
urged
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
David
,
ye
're
the
lad
to
sing
,
''
said
Ben
,
willing
to
show
*NL*
that
he
was
not
discomfited
by
this
check
.
``
Sing
`
My
loove
's
a
roos
*NL*
wi'out
a
thorn
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
amatory
David
was
a
young
man
of
an
unconscious
abstracted
*NL*
expression
,
which
was
due
probably
to
a
squint
of
superior
intensity
*NL*
rather
than
to
any
mental
characteristic
;
for
he
was
not
indifferent
to
*NL*
Ben
's
invitation
,
but
blushed
and
laughed
and
rubbed
his
sleeve
over
his
*NL*
mouth
in
a
way
that
was
regarded
as
a
symptom
of
yielding
.
And
for
some
*NL*
time
the
company
appeared
to
be
much
in
earnest
about
the
desire
to
hear
*NL*
David
's
song
.
But
in
vain
.
The
lyricism
of
the
evening
was
in
the
cellar
*NL*
at
present
,
and
was
not
to
be
drawn
from
that
retreat
just
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
conversation
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
taken
a
*NL*
political
turn
.
Mr.
Craig
was
not
above
talking
politics
occasionally
,
*NL*
though
he
piqued
himself
rather
on
a
wise
insight
than
on
specific
*NL*
information
.
He
saw
so
far
beyond
the
mere
facts
of
a
case
that
really
*NL*
it
was
superfluous
to
know
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
no
reader
o
'
the
paper
myself
,
''
he
observed
to-night
,
as
he
filled
*NL*
his
pipe
,
``
though
I
might
read
it
fast
enough
if
I
liked
,
for
there
's
*NL*
Miss
Lyddy
has
'em
and
's
done
with
'em
i
'
no
time
.
But
there
's
Mills
,
*NL*
now
,
sits
i
'
the
chimney-corner
and
reads
the
paper
pretty
nigh
*NL*
from
morning
to
night
,
and
when
he
's
got
to
th
'
end
o
n't
he
's
more
*NL*
addle-headed
than
he
was
at
the
beginning
.
He
's
full
o
'
this
peace
now
,
*NL*
as
they
talk
on
;
he
's
been
reading
and
reading
,
and
thinks
he
's
got
to
*NL*
the
bottom
o
n't
.
`
Why
,
Lor
'
bless
you
,
Mills
,
'
says
I
,
`
you
see
no
more
*NL*
into
this
thing
nor
you
can
see
into
the
middle
of
a
potato

I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
what
it
is
:
you
think
it
'll
be
a
fine
thing
for
the
country

And
I
'm
*NL*
not
again
'
it
--
mark
my
words
--
I
'm
not
again

it
.
But
it
's
my
opinion
as
*NL*
there
's
them
at
the
head
o
'
this
country
as
are
worse
enemies
to
us
*NL*
nor
Bony
and
all
the
mounseers
he
's
got
at

back
;
for
as
for
the
*NL*
mounseers
,
you
may
skewer
half-a-dozen
of
'em
at
once
as
if
they
war
*NL*
frogs

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Martin
Poyser
,
listening
with
an
air
of
much
*NL*
intelligence
and
edification
,
``
they
ne'er
ate
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
says
I
to
Mills

''
continued
Mr.
Craig
,
''
`
Will

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
fine
talking
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
now
seated
near
*NL*
her
husband
,
with
Totty
on
her
lap
--
``
it
's
fine
talking

said
Mr.

turning
his

on

in

a
dubitative
manner

giving
a

puff
to
his

between

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

paused
a
moment
with
an
emphatic
stare
after
this
triumphant
*NL*
specimen
of
Socratic
argument
,
and
then
added
,
thumping
the
table
rather
*NL*
fiercely
,
``
Why

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Think
o

that

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
impressed
at
once
with
the
*NL*
political
bearings
of
the
fact
and
with
its
striking
interest
as
an
*NL*
anecdote
in
natural
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

Craig
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
that
's
a
little
too
strong
.
You
do

It
's
all

the
French

such
poor

Mr.

Irwine

in

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Poyser
looked
doubtfully
at
Mr.
Craig
,
puzzled
by
this
opposition
of
*NL*
authorities
.
Mr.
Irwine
's
testimony
was
not
to
be
disputed
;
but
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
Craig
was
a
knowing
fellow
,
and
his
view
was
less
startling
.
*NL*
Martin
had
never
``
heard
tell
''
of
the
French
being
good
for
much
.
Mr.
*NL*
Craig
had
found
no
answer
but
such
as
was
implied
in
taking
a
long
*NL*
draught
of
ale
and
then
looking
down
fixedly
at
the
proportions
of
his
*NL*
own
leg
,
which
he
turned
a
little
outward
for
that
purpose
,
when
Bartle
*NL*
Massey
returned
from
the
fireplace
,
where
he
had
been
smoking
his
*NL*
first
pipe
in
quiet
,
and
broke
the
silence
by
saying
,
as
he
thrust
his
*NL*
forefinger
into
the
canister
,
``
Why
,
Adam
,
how
happened
you
not

age

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Mr.

said
Adam
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

said
Mr.

reminded
of

Dinah
for
the
first
time
this
evening
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
had
thought
of
Dinah
several
times
since
Adam
had
come
in
,
*NL*
but
she
had
had
``
no
heart
''
to
mention
the
bad
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Bartle
,
with
an
air
of
disgust
.
``
Was
there
a

*NL*
concerned

Then
I
give
you
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it

Mr.

``
Come

now

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Bartle
.
*NL*
``

to

,
I

she
's
like
the

thinks
*NL*
two

two
'll
come

cries

bothers
enough
about

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye

said
Mrs.

;
``

*NL*
*NL*
Martin
Poyser
shook
with
delighted
laughter
and
winked
at
Adam
,
as
much
*NL*
as
to
say
the
schoolmaster
was
in
for
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Bartle
sneeringly
,
``
the
women
are
quick
enough
--
they
're
quick
*NL*
enough
.
They
know
the
rights
of

they
hear
it
,
and
can

tell
a

what
his
thoughts
are
before
he

'em
himself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like

''
said
Mrs.

,
``
for

so
slow

they

catch
'em
by
the
tail

I
can

count
a

tongue

Howiver

I

not

foolish

God
Almighty
made
'em
to
match
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Match
!
''
said
Bartle
.
``
Aye
,
as
vinegar
matches

If

it

She

such
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Mrs.

``
I
know
what

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
willing
to
conciliate
Mrs.

and
setting
a
*NL*
high
value
on
his
own
compliments
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

dryly

*NL*
``

said
Mr.

throwing
himself
back
and
*NL*
looking
merrily
at
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

answered
Mrs.
Poyser
,
with
dangerous
fire
kindling
in
her
*NL*
eye

``

say

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Poyser
would
probably
have
brought
her
rejoinder
to
a
further
*NL*
climax
,
if
every
one
's
attention
had
not
at
this
moment
been
called
to
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
where
the
lyricism
,
which
had
at
first
only
*NL*
manifested
itself
by
David
's
sotto
voce
performance
of
``
My
love
's
a
rose
*NL*
without
a
thorn
,
''
had
gradually
assumed
a
rather
deafening
and
complex
*NL*
character
.
Tim
,
thinking
slightly
of
David
's
vocalization
,
was
impelled
*NL*
to
supersede
that
feeble
buzz
by
a
spirited
commencement
of
``
Three
Merry
*NL*
Mowers
,
''
but
David
was
not
to
be
put
down
so
easily
,
and
showed
himself
*NL*
capable
of
a
copious
crescendo
,
which
was
rendering
it
doubtful
whether
*NL*
the
rose
would
not
predominate
over
the
mowers
,
when
old
Kester
,
with
*NL*
an
entirely
unmoved
and
immovable
aspect
,
suddenly
set
up
a
quavering
*NL*
treble
--
as
if
he
had
been
an
alarum
,
and
the
time
was
come
for
him
to
go
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
at
Alick
's
end
of
the
table
took
this
form
of
vocal
*NL*
entertainment
very
much
as
a
matter
of
course
,
being
free
from
musical
*NL*
prejudices
;
but
Bartle
Massey
laid
down
his
pipe
and
put
his
fingers
in
*NL*
his
ears
;
and
Adam
,
who
had
been
longing
to
go
ever
since
he
had
heard
*NL*
Dinah
was
not
in
the
house
,
rose
and
said
he
must
bid
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go

said
Bartle
;
``
I
'll

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
said
Adam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Bartle
;
``

``
Eh

Adam
was
resolute

so
the
good-nights
were
said
,
and
the
two
friends
*NL*
turned
out
on
their
starlight
walk
together

*NL*
*NL*
``

Chapter
LIV
*NL*
*NL*
The
Meeting
on
the
Hill
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ADAM
understood
Dinah
's
haste
to
go
away
,
and
drew
hope
rather
than
*NL*
discouragement
from
it
.
She
was
fearful
lest
the
strength
of
her
feeling
*NL*
towards
him
should
hinder
her
from
waiting
and
listening
faithfully
for
*NL*
the
ultimate
guiding
voice
from
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
'd
asked
her
to
write
to
me
,
though
,
''
he
thought
.
``
And
yet
even
*NL*
that
might
disturb
her
a
bit
,
perhaps
.
She
wants
to
be
quite
quiet
*NL*
in
her
old
way
for
a
while
.
And
I
've
no
right
to
be
impatient
and
*NL*
interrupting
her
with
my
wishes
.
She
's
told
me
what
her
mind
is
,
*NL*
and
she
's
not
a
woman
to
say
one
thing
and
mean
another
.
I
'll
wait
*NL*
patiently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Adam
's
wise
resolution
,
and
it
throve
excellently
for
the
first
*NL*
two
or
three
weeks
on
the
nourishment
it
got
from
the
remembrance
of
*NL*
Dinah
's
confession
that
Sunday
afternoon
.
There
is
a
wonderful
amount
*NL*
of
sustenance
in
the
first
few
words
of
love
.
But
towards
the
middle
*NL*
of
October
the
resolution
began
to
dwindle
perceptibly
,
and
showed
*NL*
dangerous
symptoms
of
exhaustion
.
The
weeks
were
unusually
long
:
Dinah
*NL*
must
surely
have
had
more
than
enough
time
to
make
up
her
mind
.
Let
a
*NL*
woman
say
what
she
will
after
she
has
once
told
a
man
that
she
loves
*NL*
him
,
he
is
a
little
too
flushed
and
exalted
with
that
first
draught
she
*NL*
offers
him
to
care
much
about
the
taste
of
the
second
.
He
treads
the
*NL*
earth
with
a
very
elastic
step
as
he
walks
away
from
her
,
and
makes
*NL*
light
of
all
difficulties
.
But
that
sort
of
glow
dies
out
:
memory
gets
*NL*
sadly
diluted
with
time
,
and
is
not
strong
enough
to
revive
us
.
Adam
*NL*
was
no
longer
so
confident
as
he
had
been
.
He
began
to
fear
that
perhaps
*NL*
Dinah
's
old
life
would
have
too
strong
a
grasp
upon
her
for
any
new
*NL*
feeling
to
triumph
.
If
she
had
not
felt
this
,
she
would
surely
have
*NL*
written
to
him
to
give
him
some
comfort
;
but
it
appeared
that
she
held
*NL*
it
right
to
discourage
him
.
As
Adam
's
confidence
waned
,
his
patience
*NL*
waned
with
it
,
and
he
thought
he
must
write
himself
.
He
must
ask
Dinah
*NL*
not
to
leave
him
in
painful
doubt
longer
than
was
needful
.
He
sat
up
*NL*
late
one
night
to
write
her
a
letter
,
but
the
next
morning
he
burnt
it
,
*NL*
afraid
of
its
effect
.
It
would
be
worse
to
have
a
discouraging
answer
*NL*
by
letter
than
from
her
own
lips
,
for
her
presence
reconciled
him
to
her
*NL*
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
perceive
how
it
was
:
Adam
was
hungering
for
the
sight
of
Dinah
,
and
*NL*
when
that
sort
of
hunger
reaches
a
certain
stage
,
a
lover
is
likely
to
*NL*
still
it
though
he
may
have
to
put
his
future
in
pawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
harm
could
he
do
by
going
to
Snowfield
?
Dinah
could
not
be
*NL*
displeased
with
him
for
it
.
She
had
not
forbidden
him
to
go
.
She
must
*NL*
surely
expect
that
he
would
go
before
long
.
By
the
second
Sunday
in
*NL*
October
this
view
of
the
case
had
become
so
clear
to
Adam
that
he
was
*NL*
already
on
his
way
to
Snowfield
,
on
horseback
this
time
,
for
his
hours
*NL*
were
precious
now
,
and
he
had
borrowed
Jonathan
Burge
's
good
nag
for
the
*NL*
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
keen
memories
went
along
the
road
with
him
!
He
had
often
been
to
*NL*
Oakbourne
and
back
since
that
first
journey
to
Snowfield
,
but
beyond
*NL*
Oakbourne
the
greystone
walls
,
the
broken
country
,
the
meagre
trees
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
telling
him
afresh
the
story
of
that
painful
past
which
he
*NL*
knew
so
well
by
heart
.
But
no
story
is
the
same
to
us
after
a
lapse
of
*NL*
time
--
or
rather
,
we
who
read
it
are
no
longer
the
same
interpreters
--
and
*NL*
Adam
this
morning
brought
with
him
new
thoughts
through
that
grey
*NL*
country
,
thoughts
which
gave
an
altered
significance
to
its
story
of
the
*NL*
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
a
base
and
selfish
,
even
a
blasphemous
,
spirit
which
rejoices
*NL*
and
is
thankful
over
the
past
evil
that
has
blighted
or
crushed
another
,
*NL*
because
it
has
been
made
a
source
of
unforeseen
good
to
ourselves
.
Adam
*NL*
could
never
cease
to
mourn
over
that
mystery
of
human
sorrow
which
had
*NL*
been
brought
so
close
to
him
;
he
could
never
thank
God
for
another
's
*NL*
misery
.
And
if
I
were
capable
of
that
narrow-sighted
joy
in
Adam
's
*NL*
behalf
,
I
should
still
know
he
was
not
the
man
to
feel
it
for
himself
.
*NL*
He
would
have
shaken
his
head
at
such
a
sentiment
and
said
,
``
Evil
's
*NL*
evil
,
and
sorrow
's
sorrow
,
and
you
ca
n't
alter
it
's
natur
by
wrapping
*NL*
it
up
in
other
words
.
Other
folks
were
not
created
for
my
sake
,
that
I
*NL*
should
think
all
square
when
things
turn
out
well
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
not
ignoble
to
feel
that
the
fuller
life
which
a
sad
*NL*
experience
has
brought
us
is
worth
our
own
personal
share
of
pain
.
*NL*
Surely
it
is
not
possible
to
feel
otherwise
,
any
more
than
it
would
be
*NL*
possible
for
a
man
with
cataract
to
regret
the
painful
process
by
which
*NL*
his
dim
blurred
sight
of
men
as
trees
walking
had
been
exchanged
for
*NL*
clear
outline
and
effulgent
day
.
The
growth
of
higher
feeling
within
*NL*
us
is
like
the
growth
of
faculty
,
bringing
with
it
a
sense
of
added
*NL*
strength
.
We
can
no
more
wish
to
return
to
a
narrower
sympathy
than
*NL*
a
painter
or
a
musician
can
wish
to
return
to
his
cruder
manner
,
or
a
*NL*
philosopher
to
his
less
complete
formula
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
like
this
sense
of
enlarged
being
was
in
Adam
's
mind
this
*NL*
Sunday
morning
,
as
he
rode
along
in
vivid
recollection
of
the
past
.
His
*NL*
feeling
towards
Dinah
,
the
hope
of
passing
his
life
with
her
,
had
been
*NL*
the
distant
unseen
point
towards
which
that
hard
journey
from
Snowfield
*NL*
eighteen
months
ago
had
been
leading
him
.
Tender
and
deep
as
his
love
*NL*
for
Hetty
had
been
--
so
deep
that
the
roots
of
it
would
never
be
torn
*NL*
away
--
his
love
for
Dinah
was
better
and
more
precious
to
him
,
for
it
*NL*
was
the
outgrowth
of
that
fuller
life
which
had
come
to
him
from
his
*NL*
acquaintance
with
deep
sorrow
.
``
It
's
like
as
if
it
was
a
new
strength
to
*NL*
me
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
to
love
her
and
know
as
she
loves
me
.
I
shall
*NL*
look
t
'
her
to
help
me
to
see
things
right
.
For
she
's
better
than
I
*NL*
am
--
there
's
less
o
'
self
in
her
,
and
pride
.
And
it
's
a
feeling
as
gives
*NL*
you
a
sort
o
'
liberty
,
as
if
you
could
walk
more
fearless
,
when
you
've
*NL*
more
trust
in
another
than
y
'
have
in
yourself
.
I
've
always
been
*NL*
thinking
I
knew
better
than
them
as
belonged
to
me
,
and
that
's
a
poor
*NL*
sort
o
'
life
,
when
you
ca
n't
look
to
them
nearest
to
you
t
'
help
you
*NL*
with
a
bit
better
thought
than
what
you
've
got
inside
you
a
`
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
than
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
Adam
came
in
sight
of
*NL*
the
grey
town
on
the
hill-side
and
looked
searchingly
towards
the
green
*NL*
valley
below
,
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
old
thatched
roof
near
the
*NL*
ugly
red
mill
.
The
scene
looked
less
harsh
in
the
soft
October
sunshine
*NL*
than
it
had
in
the
eager
time
of
early
spring
,
and
the
one
grand
charm
*NL*
it
possessed
in
common
with
all
wide-stretching
woodless
regions
--
that
*NL*
it
filled
you
with
a
new
consciousness
of
the
overarching
sky
--
had
a
*NL*
milder
,
more
soothing
influence
than
usual
,
on
this
almost
cloudless
*NL*
day
.
Adam
's
doubts
and
fears
melted
under
this
influence
as
the
delicate
*NL*
weblike
clouds
had
gradually
melted
away
into
the
clear
blue
above
him
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
see
Dinah
's
gentle
face
assuring
him
,
with
its
looks
alone
,
*NL*
of
all
he
longed
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
expect
Dinah
to
be
at
home
at
this
hour
,
but
he
got
down
from
*NL*
his
horse
and
tied
it
at
the
little
gate
,
that
he
might
ask
where
she
*NL*
was
gone
to-day
.
He
had
set
his
mind
on
following
her
and
bringing
her
*NL*
home
.
She
was
gone
to
Sloman
's
End
,
a
hamlet
about
three
miles
off
,
over
*NL*
the
hill
,
the
old
woman
told
him
--
had
set
off
directly
after
morning
*NL*
chapel
,
to
preach
in
a
cottage
there
,
as
her
habit
was
.
Anybody
at
the
*NL*
town
would
tell
him
the
way
to
Sloman
's
End
.
So
Adam
got
on
his
horse
*NL*
again
and
rode
to
the
town
,
putting
up
at
the
old
inn
and
taking
a
*NL*
hasty
dinner
there
in
the
company
of
the
too
chatty
landlord
,
from
whose
*NL*
friendly
questions
and
reminiscences
he
was
glad
to
escape
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
and
set
out
towards
Sloman
's
End
.
With
all
his
haste
it
was
*NL*
nearly
four
o'clock
before
he
could
set
off
,
and
he
thought
that
as
*NL*
Dinah
had
gone
so
early
,
she
would
perhaps
already
be
near
returning
.
*NL*
The
little
,
grey
,
desolate-looking
hamlet
,
unscreened
by
sheltering
*NL*
trees
,
lay
in
sight
long
before
he
reached
it
,
and
as
he
came
near
he
*NL*
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
singing
a
hymn
.
``
Perhaps
that
's
the
last
*NL*
hymn
before
they
come
away
,
''
Adam
thought
.
``
I
'll
walk
back
a
bit
and
*NL*
turn
again
to
meet
her
,
farther
off
the
village
.
''
He
walked
back
till
he
*NL*
got
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
again
,
and
seated
himself
on
a
loose
*NL*
stone
,
against
the
low
wall
,
to
watch
till
he
should
see
the
little
*NL*
black
figure
leaving
the
hamlet
and
winding
up
the
hill
.
He
chose
*NL*
this
spot
,
almost
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
because
it
was
away
from
all
*NL*
eyes
--
no
house
,
no
cattle
,
not
even
a
nibbling
sheep
near
--
no
presence
*NL*
but
the
still
lights
and
shadows
and
the
great
embracing
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
much
longer
coming
than
he
expected
.
He
waited
an
hour
at
*NL*
least
watching
for
her
and
thinking
of
her
,
while
the
afternoon
shadows
*NL*
lengthened
and
the
light
grew
softer
.
At
last
he
saw
the
little
black
*NL*
figure
coming
from
between
the
grey
houses
and
gradually
approaching
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
hill
.
Slowly
,
Adam
thought
,
but
Dinah
was
really
walking
at
*NL*
her
usual
pace
,
with
a
light
quiet
step
.
Now
she
was
beginning
to
wind
*NL*
along
the
path
up
the
hill
,
but
Adam
would
not
move
yet
;
he
would
not
*NL*
meet
her
too
soon
;
he
had
set
his
heart
on
meeting
her
in
this
assured
*NL*
loneliness
.
And
now
he
began
to
fear
lest
he
should
startle
her
too
*NL*
much
.
``
Yet
,
''
he
thought
,
``
she
's
not
one
to
be
overstartled
;
she
's
always
*NL*
so
calm
and
quiet
,
as
if
she
was
prepared
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
she
thinking
of
as
she
wound
up
the
hill
?
Perhaps
she
had
found
*NL*
complete
repose
without
him
,
and
had
ceased
to
feel
any
need
of
his
*NL*
love
.
On
the
verge
of
a
decision
we
all
tremble
:
hope
pauses
with
*NL*
fluttering
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
at
last
she
was
very
near
,
and
Adam
rose
from
the
stone
wall
.
*NL*
It
happened
that
just
as
he
walked
forward
,
Dinah
had
paused
and
turned
*NL*
round
to
look
back
at
the
village
--
who
does
not
pause
and
look
back
in
*NL*
mounting
a
hill
?
Adam
was
glad
,
for
,
with
the
fine
instinct
of
a
lover
,
*NL*
he
felt
that
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
hear
his
voice
before
she
*NL*
saw
him
.
He
came
within
three
paces
of
her
and
then
said
,
``
Dinah
!
''
She
*NL*
started
without
looking
round
,
as
if
she
connected
the
sound
with
no
*NL*
place
.
``
Dinah
!
''
Adam
said
again
.
He
knew
quite
well
what
was
in
her
*NL*
mind
.
She
was
so
accustomed
to
think
of
impressions
as
purely
spiritual
*NL*
monitions
that
she
looked
for
no
material
visible
accompaniment
of
the
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
second
time
she
looked
round
.
What
a
look
of
yearning
love
it
*NL*
was
that
the
mild
grey
eyes
turned
on
the
strong
dark-eyed
man
!
She
did
*NL*
not
start
again
at
the
sight
of
him
;
she
said
nothing
,
but
moved
towards
*NL*
him
so
that
his
arm
could
clasp
her
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
walked
on
so
in
silence
,
while
the
warm
tears
fell
.
Adam
was
*NL*
content
,
and
said
nothing
.
It
was
Dinah
who
spoke
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adam
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
is
the
Divine
Will
.
My
soul
is
so
knit
to
yours
*NL*
that
it
is
but
a
divided
life
I
live
without
you
.
And
this
moment
,
now
*NL*
you
are
with
me
,
and
I
feel
that
our
hearts
are
filled
with
the
same
*NL*
love
.
I
have
a
fulness
of
strength
to
bear
and
do
our
heavenly
Father
's
*NL*
Will
that
I
had
lost
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
paused
and
looked
into
her
sincere
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
'll
never
part
any
more
,
Dinah
,
till
death
parts
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
kissed
each
other
with
a
deep
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
greater
thing
is
there
for
two
human
souls
than
to
feel
that
they
*NL*
are
joined
for
life
--
to
strengthen
each
other
in
all
labour
,
to
rest
on
*NL*
each
other
in
all
sorrow
,
to
minister
to
each
other
in
all
pain
,
to
be
*NL*
one
with
each
other
in
silent
unspeakable
memories
at
the
moment
of
the
*NL*
last
parting
?

Marriage
Bells
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
little
more
than
a
month
after
that
meeting
on
the
hill
--
on
a
rimy
*NL*
morning
in
departing
November
--
Adam
and
Dinah
were
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
event
much
thought
of
in
the
village
.
All
Mr.
Burge
's
men
had
*NL*
a
holiday
,
and
all
Mr.
Poyser
's
,
and
most
of
those
who
had
a
holiday
*NL*
appeared
in
their
best
clothes
at
the
wedding
.
I
think
there
was
hardly
*NL*
an
inhabitant
of
Hayslope
specially
mentioned
in
this
history
and
still
*NL*
resident
in
the
parish
on
this
November
morning
who
was
not
either
in
*NL*
church
to
see
Adam
and
Dinah
married
,
or
near
the
church
door
to
greet
*NL*
them
as
they
came
forth
.
Mrs.
Irwine
and
her
daughters
were
waiting
at
*NL*
the
churchyard
gates
in
their
carriage
-LRB-
for
they
had
a
carriage
now
-RRB-
to
*NL*
shake
hands
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
wish
them
well
;
and
in
the
*NL*
absence
of
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
at
Bath
,
Mrs.
Best
,
Mr.
Mills
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Craig
had
felt
it
incumbent
on
them
to
represent
``
the
family
''
at
the
*NL*
Chase
on
the
occasion
.
The
churchyard
walk
was
quite
lined
with
familiar
*NL*
faces
,
many
of
them
faces
that
had
first
looked
at
Dinah
when
she
*NL*
preached
on
the
Green
.
And
no
wonder
they
showed
this
eager
interest
on
*NL*
her
marriage
morning
,
for
nothing
like
Dinah
and
the
history
which
had
*NL*
brought
her
and
Adam
Bede
together
had
been
known
at
Hayslope
within
the
*NL*
memory
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bessy
Cranage
,
in
her
neatest
cap
and
frock
,
was
crying
,
though
she
did
*NL*
not
exactly
know
why
;
for
,
as
her
cousin
Wiry
Ben
,
who
stood
near
her
,
*NL*
judiciously
suggested
,
Dinah
was
not
going
away
,
and
if
Bessy
was
in
low
*NL*
spirits
,
the
best
thing
for
her
to
do
was
to
follow
Dinah
's
example
and
*NL*
marry
an
honest
fellow
who
was
ready
to
have
her
.
Next
to
Bessy
,
just
*NL*
within
the
church
door
,
there
were
the
Poyser
children
,
peeping
round
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
pews
to
get
a
sight
of
the
mysterious
ceremony
;
*NL*
Totty
's
face
wearing
an
unusual
air
of
anxiety
at
the
idea
of
seeing
*NL*
cousin
Dinah
come
back
looking
rather
old
,
for
in
Totty
's
experience
no
*NL*
married
people
were
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
envy
them
all
the
sight
they
had
when
the
marriage
was
fairly
ended
*NL*
and
Adam
led
Dinah
out
of
church
.
She
was
not
in
black
this
morning
,
*NL*
for
her
Aunt
Poyser
would
by
no
means
allow
such
a
risk
of
incurring
bad
*NL*
luck
,
and
had
herself
made
a
present
of
the
wedding
dress
,
made
all
of
*NL*
grey
,
though
in
the
usual
Quaker
form
,
for
on
this
point
Dinah
could
not
*NL*
give
way
.
So
the
lily
face
looked
out
with
sweet
gravity
from
under
*NL*
a
grey
Quaker
bonnet
,
neither
smiling
nor
blushing
,
but
with
lips
*NL*
trembling
a
little
under
the
weight
of
solemn
feelings
.
Adam
,
as
he
*NL*
pressed
her
arm
to
his
side
,
walked
with
his
old
erectness
and
his
head
*NL*
thrown
rather
backward
as
if
to
face
all
the
world
better
.
But
it
was
*NL*
not
because
he
was
particularly
proud
this
morning
,
as
is
the
wont
of
*NL*
bridegrooms
,
for
his
happiness
was
of
a
kind
that
had
little
reference
*NL*
to
men
's
opinion
of
it
.
There
was
a
tinge
of
sadness
in
his
deep
joy
;
*NL*
Dinah
knew
it
,
and
did
not
feel
aggrieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
other
couples
,
following
the
bride
and
bridegroom
:
*NL*
first
,
Martin
Poyser
,
looking
as
cheery
as
a
bright
fire
on
this
rimy
*NL*
morning
,
led
quiet
Mary
Burge
,
the
bridesmaid
;
then
came
Seth
serenely
*NL*
happy
,
with
Mrs.
Poyser
on
his
arm
;
and
last
of
all
Bartle
Massey
,
with
*NL*
Lisbeth
--
Lisbeth
in
a
new
gown
and
bonnet
,
too
busy
with
her
pride
in
*NL*
her
son
and
her
delight
in
possessing
the
one
daughter
she
had
desired
*NL*
to
devise
a
single
pretext
for
complaint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bartle
Massey
had
consented
to
attend
the
wedding
at
Adam
's
earnest
*NL*
request
,
under
protest
against
marriage
in
general
and
the
marriage
of
a
*NL*
sensible
man
in
particular
.
Nevertheless
,
Mr.
Poyser
had
a
joke
against
*NL*
him
after
the
wedding
dinner
,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
vestry
he
had
*NL*
given
the
bride
one
more
kiss
than
was
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
this
last
couple
came
Mr.
Irwine
,
glad
at
heart
over
this
good
*NL*
morning
's
work
of
joining
Adam
and
Dinah
.
For
he
had
seen
Adam
in
the
*NL*
worst
moments
of
his
sorrow
;
and
what
better
harvest
from
that
painful
*NL*
seed-time
could
there
be
than
this
?
The
love
that
had
brought
hope
and
*NL*
comfort
in
the
hour
of
despair
,
the
love
that
had
found
its
way
to
the
*NL*
dark
prison
cell
and
to
poor
Hetty
's
darker
soul
--
this
strong
gentle
*NL*
love
was
to
be
Adam
's
companion
and
helper
till
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
shaking
of
hands
mingled
with
``
God
bless
you
's
''
and
other
*NL*
good
wishes
to
the
four
couples
,
at
the
churchyard
gate
,
Mr.
Poyser
*NL*
answering
for
the
rest
with
unwonted
vivacity
of
tongue
,
for
he
had
*NL*
all
the
appropriate
wedding-day
jokes
at
his
command
.
And
the
women
,
he
*NL*
observed
,
could
never
do
anything
but
put
finger
in
eye
at
a
wedding
.
*NL*
Even
Mrs.
Poyser
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
as
the
neighbours
*NL*
shook
hands
with
her
,
and
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
in
the
face
of
the
very
*NL*
first
person
who
told
her
she
was
getting
young
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
,
having
a
slight
touch
of
rheumatism
,
did
not
join
*NL*
in
the
ringing
of
the
bells
this
morning
,
and
,
looking
on
with
some
*NL*
contempt
at
these
informal
greetings
which
required
no
official
*NL*
co-operation
from
the
clerk
,
began
to
hum
in
his
musical
bass
,
``
Oh
what
*NL*
a
joyful
thing
it
is
,
''
by
way
of
preluding
a
little
to
the
effect
he
*NL*
intended
to
produce
in
the
wedding
psalm
next
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
bit
of
good
news
to
cheer
Arthur
,
''
said
Mr.
Irwine
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
as
they
drove
off
.
``
I
shall
write
to
him
the
first
thing
when
we
*NL*
get
home
.

Epilogue
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
is
near
the
end
of
June
,
in
1807
.
The
workshops
have
been
shut
*NL*
up
half
an
hour
or
more
in
Adam
Bede
's
timber-yard
,
which
used
to
*NL*
be
Jonathan
Burge
's
,
and
the
mellow
evening
light
is
falling
on
the
*NL*
pleasant
house
with
the
buff
walls
and
the
soft
grey
thatch
,
very
much
*NL*
as
it
did
when
we
saw
Adam
bringing
in
the
keys
on
that
June
evening
*NL*
nine
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
figure
we
know
well
,
just
come
out
of
the
house
,
and
shading
*NL*
her
eyes
with
her
hands
as
she
looks
for
something
in
the
distance
,
for
*NL*
the
rays
that
fall
on
her
white
borderless
cap
and
her
pale
auburn
hair
*NL*
are
very
dazzling
.
But
now
she
turns
away
from
the
sunlight
and
looks
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
see
the
sweet
pale
face
quite
well
now
:
it
is
scarcely
at
all
*NL*
altered
--
only
a
little
fuller
,
to
correspond
to
her
more
matronly
*NL*
figure
,
which
still
seems
light
and
active
enough
in
the
plain
black
*NL*
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
him
,
Seth
,
''
Dinah
said
,
as
she
looked
into
the
house
.
``
Let
us
go
*NL*
and
meet
him
.
Come
,
Lisbeth
,
come
with
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
call
was
answered
immediately
by
a
small
fair
creature
with
*NL*
pale
auburn
hair
and
grey
eyes
,
little
more
than
four
years
old
,
who
ran
*NL*
out
silently
and
put
her
hand
into
her
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Uncle
Seth
,
''
said
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
we
're
coming
,
''
Seth
answered
from
within
,
and
presently
*NL*
appeared
stooping
under
the
doorway
,
being
taller
than
usual
by
the
*NL*
black
head
of
a
sturdy
two-year-old
nephew
,
who
had
caused
some
delay
by
*NL*
demanding
to
be
carried
on
uncle
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
take
him
on
thy
arm
,
Seth
,
''
said
Dinah
,
looking
fondly
at
the
*NL*
stout
black-eyed
fellow
.
``
He
's
troublesome
to
thee
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
:
Addy
likes
a
ride
on
my
shoulder
.
I
can
carry
him
so
for
a
*NL*
bit
.
''
A
kindness
which
young
Addy
acknowledged
by
drumming
his
heels
*NL*
with
promising
force
against
Uncle
Seth
's
chest
.
But
to
walk
by
Dinah
's
*NL*
side
,
and
be
tyrannized
over
by
Dinah
's
and
Adam
's
children
,
was
Uncle
*NL*
Seth
's
earthly
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
didst
see
him
?
''
asked
Seth
,
as
they
walked
on
into
the
adjoining
*NL*
field
.
``
I
ca
n't
catch
sight
of
him
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Between
the
hedges
by
the
roadside
,
''
said
Dinah
.
``
I
saw
his
hat
and
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
There
he
is
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
thee
for
catching
sight
of
him
if
he
's
anywhere
to
be
seen
,
''
said
*NL*
Seth
,
smiling
.
``
Thee
'
t
like
poor
mother
used
to
be
.
She
was
always
on
*NL*
the
look
out
for
Adam
,
and
could
see
him
sooner
than
other
folks
,
for
*NL*
all
her
eyes
got
dim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
longer
than
he
expected
,
''
said
Dinah
,
taking
Arthur
's
watch
*NL*
from
a
small
side
pocket
and
looking
at
it
;
``
it
's
nigh
upon
seven
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
they
'd
have
a
deal
to
say
to
one
another
,
''
said
Seth
,
``
and
the
*NL*
meeting
`
ud
touch
'em
both
pretty
closish
.
Why
,
it
's
getting
on
towards
*NL*
eight
years
since
they
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dinah
,
``
Adam
was
greatly
moved
this
morning
at
the
thought
*NL*
of
the
change
he
should
see
in
the
poor
young
man
,
from
the
sickness
he
*NL*
has
undergone
,
as
well
as
the
years
which
have
changed
us
all
.
And
the
*NL*
death
of
the
poor
wanderer
,
when
she
was
coming
back
to
us
,
has
been
*NL*
sorrow
upon
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
Addy
,
''
said
Seth
,
lowering
the
young
one
to
his
arm
now
and
*NL*
pointing
,
``
there
's
Father
coming
--
at
the
far
stile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dinah
hastened
her
steps
,
and
little
Lisbeth
ran
on
at
her
utmost
speed
*NL*
till
she
clasped
her
father
's
leg
.
Adam
patted
her
head
and
lifted
her
*NL*
up
to
kiss
her
,
but
Dinah
could
see
the
marks
of
agitation
on
his
face
*NL*
as
she
approached
him
,
and
he
put
her
arm
within
his
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
youngster
,
must
I
take
you
?
''
he
said
,
trying
to
smile
,
when
Addy
*NL*
stretched
out
his
arms
--
ready
,
with
the
usual
baseness
of
infancy
,
to
*NL*
give
up
his
Uncle
Seth
at
once
,
now
there
was
some
rarer
patronage
at
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
cut
me
a
good
deal
,
Dinah
,
''
Adam
said
at
last
,
when
they
were
*NL*
walking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Didst
find
him
greatly
altered
?
''
said
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
's
altered
and
yet
not
altered
.
I
should
ha
'
known
him
anywhere
.
*NL*
But
his
colour
's
changed
,
and
he
looks
sadly
.
However
,
the
doctors
say
*NL*
he
'll
soon
be
set
right
in
his
own
country
air
.
He
's
all
sound
in
th
'
*NL*
inside
;
it
's
only
the
fever
shattered
him
so
.
But
he
speaks
just
the
*NL*
same
,
and
smiles
at
me
just
as
he
did
when
he
was
a
lad
.
It
's
wonderful
*NL*
how
he
's
always
had
just
the
same
sort
o
'
look
when
he
smiles
.

``
I
've
never
seen
him
smile

poor
young
man

said
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
thee
wilt
see
him
smile
,
to-morrow
,
''
said
Adam
.
``
He
asked
after
*NL*
thee
the
first
thing
when
he
began
to
come
round
,
and
we
could
talk
to
*NL*
one
another
.
'
I
hope
she
is
n't
altered

he
said
,
'
I
remember
her
face
*NL*
so
well
.
'
I
told
him
`
no
,
'
''
Adam
continued
,
looking
fondly
at
the
eyes
*NL*
that
were
turned
towards
his
,
``
only
a
bit
plumper
,
as
thee
`
dst
a
right
*NL*
to
be
after
seven
year
.

I
may
come
and
see
her
to-morrow
,
may
n't
I
?
'
he
*NL*
said
;
'
I
long
to
tell
her
how
I
've
thought
of
her
all
these
years
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Didst
tell
him
I
'd
always
used
the
watch
?
''
said
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
;
and
we
talked
a
deal
about
thee
,
for
he
says
he
never
saw
a
woman
*NL*
a
bit
like
thee
.
'
I
shall
turn
Methodist
some
day
,
'
he
said
,
`
when
she
*NL*
preaches
out
of
doors
,
and
go
to
hear
her
.
'
And
I
said
,
`
Nay
,
sir
,
you
*NL*
ca
n't
do
that
,
for
Conference
has
forbid
the
women
preaching
,
and
she
's
*NL*
given
it
up
,
all
but
talking
to
the
people
a
bit
in
their
houses
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Seth
,
who
could
not
repress
a
comment
on
this
point
,
``
and
a
*NL*
sore
pity
it
was
o
'
Conference
;
and
if
Dinah
had
seen
as
I
did
,
we
'd
ha
'
*NL*
left
the
Wesleyans
and
joined
a
body
that
`
ud
put
no
bonds
on
Christian
*NL*
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
lad
,
nay
,
''
said
Adam
,
``
she
was
right
and
thee
wast
wrong
.
There
's
*NL*
no
rules
so
wise
but
what
it
's
a
pity
for
somebody
or
other
.
Most
o
'
*NL*
the
women
do
more
harm
nor
good
with
their
preaching
--
they
've
not
got
*NL*
Dinah
's
gift
nor
her
sperrit
--
and
she
's
seen
that
,
and
she
thought
it
*NL*
right
to
set
th
'
example
o
'
submitting
,
for
she
's
not
held
from
other
*NL*
sorts
o
'
teaching
.
And
I
agree
with
her
,
and
approve
o
'
what
she
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seth
was
silent
.
This
was
a
standing
subject
of
difference
rarely
*NL*
alluded
to
,
and
Dinah
,
wishing
to
quit
it
at
once
,
said
,
``
Didst
*NL*
remember
,
Adam
,
to
speak
to
Colonel
Donnithorne
the
words
my
uncle
and
*NL*
aunt
entrusted
to
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
's
going
to
the
Hall
Farm
with
Mr.
Irwine
the
day
after
*NL*
to-morrow
.
Mr.
Irwine
came
in
while
we
were
talking
about
it
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
it
as
the
Colonel
must
see
nobody
but
thee
to-morrow
.
He
*NL*
said
--
and
he
's
in
the
right
of
it
--
as
it
'll
be
bad
for
him
t
'
have
his
*NL*
feelings
stirred
with
seeing
many
people
one
after
another
.
`
We
must
*NL*
get
you
strong
and
hearty
,
'
he
said
,
`
that
's
the
first
thing
to
be
done
*NL*
Arthur
,
and
then
you
shall
have
your
own
way
.
But
I
shall
keep
you
*NL*
under
your
old
tutor
's
thumb
till
then

Mr.
Irwine
's
fine
and
joyful
at
*NL*
having
him
home
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Adam
was
silent
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
``
It
was
very
cutting
when
*NL*
we
first
saw
one
another
.
He
'd
never
heard
about
poor
Hetty
till
Mr.
*NL*
Irwine
met
him
in
London
,
for
the
letters
missed
him
on
his
journey
.
*NL*
The
first
thing
he
said
to
me
,
when
we
'd
got
hold
o
'
one
another
's
hands
*NL*
was
,
'
I
could
never
do
anything
for
her
,
Adam
--
she
lived
long
enough
*NL*
for
all
the
suffering
--
and
I
'd
thought
so
of
the
time
when
I
might
do
*NL*
something
for
her
.
But
you
told
me
the
truth
when
you
said
to
me
once
,
*NL*
``
There
's
a
sort
of
wrong
that
can
never
be
made
up
for

``
Why

there
's
Mr.

Mrs.
Poyser
coming
in
at

yard
gate

Seth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
is

said
Dinah
.
``
Run

Lisbeth

run
to
meet
Aunt
Poyser

Come
*NL*
in

Adam

it
has
been
a
hard
day
for
thee
