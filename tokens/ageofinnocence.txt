On
a
January
evening
of
the
early
seventies
,
Christine
Nilsson
was
*NL*
singing
in
Faust
at
the
Academy
of
Music
in
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
was
already
talk
of
the
erection
,
in
remote
metropolitan
*NL*
distances
``
above
the
Forties
,
''
of
a
new
Opera
House
which
should
*NL*
compete
in
costliness
and
splendour
with
those
of
the
great
European
*NL*
capitals
,
the
world
of
fashion
was
still
content
to
reassemble
every
*NL*
winter
in
the
shabby
red
and
gold
boxes
of
the
sociable
old
Academy
.
*NL*
Conservatives
cherished
it
for
being
small
and
inconvenient
,
and
thus
*NL*
keeping
out
the
``
new
people
''
whom
New
York
was
beginning
to
dread
and
*NL*
yet
be
drawn
to
;
and
the
sentimental
clung
to
it
for
its
historic
*NL*
associations
,
and
the
musical
for
its
excellent
acoustics
,
always
so
*NL*
problematic
a
quality
in
halls
built
for
the
hearing
of
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Madame
Nilsson
's
first
appearance
that
winter
,
and
what
the
*NL*
daily
press
had
already
learned
to
describe
as
``
an
exceptionally
*NL*
brilliant
audience
''
had
gathered
to
hear
her
,
transported
through
the
*NL*
slippery
,
snowy
streets
in
private
broughams
,
in
the
spacious
family
*NL*
landau
,
or
in
the
humbler
but
more
convenient
``
Brown
coupe
.
''
To
come
to
*NL*
the
Opera
in
a
Brown
coupe
was
almost
as
honourable
a
way
of
arriving
*NL*
as
in
one
's
own
carriage
;
and
departure
by
the
same
means
had
the
*NL*
immense
advantage
of
enabling
one
-LRB-
with
a
playful
allusion
to
*NL*
democratic
principles
-RRB-
to
scramble
into
the
first
Brown
conveyance
in
*NL*
the
line
,
instead
of
waiting
till
the
cold-and-gin
congested
nose
of
*NL*
one
's
own
coachman
gleamed
under
the
portico
of
the
Academy
.
It
was
*NL*
one
of
the
great
livery-stableman
's
most
masterly
intuitions
to
have
*NL*
discovered
that
Americans
want
to
get
away
from
amusement
even
more
*NL*
quickly
than
they
want
to
get
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Newland
Archer
opened
the
door
at
the
back
of
the
club
box
the
*NL*
curtain
had
just
gone
up
on
the
garden
scene
.
There
was
no
reason
why
*NL*
the
young
man
should
not
have
come
earlier
,
for
he
had
dined
at
seven
,
*NL*
alone
with
his
mother
and
sister
,
and
had
lingered
afterward
over
a
*NL*
cigar
in
the
Gothic
library
with
glazed
black-walnut
bookcases
and
*NL*
finial-topped
chairs
which
was
the
only
room
in
the
house
where
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
allowed
smoking
.
But
,
in
the
first
place
,
New
York
was
a
*NL*
metropolis
,
and
perfectly
aware
that
in
metropolises
it
was
``
not
the
*NL*
thing
''
to
arrive
early
at
the
opera
;
and
what
was
or
was
not
``
the
*NL*
thing
''
played
a
part
as
important
in
Newland
Archer
's
New
York
as
the
*NL*
inscrutable
totem
terrors
that
had
ruled
the
destinies
of
his
*NL*
forefathers
thousands
of
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
reason
for
his
delay
was
a
personal
one
.
He
had
dawdled
*NL*
over
his
cigar
because
he
was
at
heart
a
dilettante
,
and
thinking
over
*NL*
a
pleasure
to
come
often
gave
him
a
subtler
satisfaction
than
its
*NL*
realisation
.
This
was
especially
the
case
when
the
pleasure
was
a
*NL*
delicate
one
,
as
his
pleasures
mostly
were
;
and
on
this
occasion
the
*NL*
moment
he
looked
forward
to
was
so
rare
and
exquisite
in
quality
*NL*
that
--
well
,
if
he
had
timed
his
arrival
in
accord
with
the
prima
*NL*
donna
's
stage-manager
he
could
not
have
entered
the
Academy
at
a
more
*NL*
significant
moment
than
just
as
she
was
singing
:
``
He
loves
me
--
he
*NL*
loves
me
not
--
HE
LOVES
ME
!
--
''
and
sprinkling
the
falling
daisy
petals
*NL*
with
notes
as
clear
as
dew
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sang
,
of
course
,
``
M'ama
!
''
and
not
``
he
loves
me
,
''
since
an
*NL*
unalterable
and
unquestioned
law
of
the
musical
world
required
that
the
*NL*
German
text
of
French
operas
sung
by
Swedish
artists
should
be
*NL*
translated
into
Italian
for
the
clearer
understanding
of
*NL*
English-speaking
audiences
.
This
seemed
as
natural
to
Newland
Archer
*NL*
as
all
the
other
conventions
on
which
his
life
was
moulded
:
such
as
the
*NL*
duty
of
using
two
silver-backed
brushes
with
his
monogram
in
blue
*NL*
enamel
to
part
his
hair
,
and
of
never
appearing
in
society
without
a
*NL*
flower
-LRB-
preferably
a
gardenia
-RRB-
in
his
buttonhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M'ama
...
non
m
`
ama
...
''
the
prima
donna
sang
,
and
``
M'ama
!
''
,
with
a
*NL*
final
burst
of
love
triumphant
,
as
she
pressed
the
dishevelled
daisy
to
*NL*
her
lips
and
lifted
her
large
eyes
to
the
sophisticated
countenance
of
*NL*
the
little
brown
Faust-Capoul
,
who
was
vainly
trying
,
in
a
tight
purple
*NL*
velvet
doublet
and
plumed
cap
,
to
look
as
pure
and
true
as
his
artless
*NL*
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
club
box
,
*NL*
turned
his
eyes
from
the
stage
and
scanned
the
opposite
side
of
the
*NL*
house
.
Directly
facing
him
was
the
box
of
old
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
,
*NL*
whose
monstrous
obesity
had
long
since
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
*NL*
attend
the
Opera
,
but
who
was
always
represented
on
fashionable
nights
*NL*
by
some
of
the
younger
members
of
the
family
.
On
this
occasion
,
the
*NL*
front
of
the
box
was
filled
by
her
daughter-in-law
,
Mrs.
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
,
and
her
daughter
,
Mrs.
Welland
;
and
slightly
withdrawn
behind
*NL*
these
brocaded
matrons
sat
a
young
girl
in
white
with
eyes
ecstatically
*NL*
fixed
on
the
stagelovers
.
As
Madame
Nilsson
's
``
M'ama
!
''
thrilled
out
*NL*
above
the
silent
house
-LRB-
the
boxes
always
stopped
talking
during
the
*NL*
Daisy
Song
-RRB-
a
warm
pink
mounted
to
the
girl
's
cheek
,
mantled
her
brow
*NL*
to
the
roots
of
her
fair
braids
,
and
suffused
the
young
slope
of
her
*NL*
breast
to
the
line
where
it
met
a
modest
tulle
tucker
fastened
with
a
*NL*
single
gardenia
.
She
dropped
her
eyes
to
the
immense
bouquet
of
*NL*
lilies-of-the-valley
on
her
knee
,
and
Newland
Archer
saw
her
*NL*
white-gloved
finger-tips
touch
the
flowers
softly
.
He
drew
a
breath
of
*NL*
satisfied
vanity
and
his
eyes
returned
to
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
expense
had
been
spared
on
the
setting
,
which
was
acknowledged
to
be
*NL*
very
beautiful
even
by
people
who
shared
his
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
Opera
houses
of
Paris
and
Vienna
.
The
foreground
,
to
the
footlights
,
*NL*
was
covered
with
emerald
green
cloth
.
In
the
middle
distance
*NL*
symmetrical
mounds
of
woolly
green
moss
bounded
by
croquet
hoops
formed
*NL*
the
base
of
shrubs
shaped
like
orange-trees
but
studded
with
large
pink
*NL*
and
red
roses
.
Gigantic
pansies
,
considerably
larger
than
the
roses
,
*NL*
and
closely
resembling
the
floral
pen-wipers
made
by
female
*NL*
parishioners
for
fashionable
clergymen
,
sprang
from
the
moss
beneath
*NL*
the
rose-trees
;
and
here
and
there
a
daisy
grafted
on
a
rose-branch
*NL*
flowered
with
a
luxuriance
prophetic
of
Mr.
Luther
Burbank
's
far-off
*NL*
prodigies
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
centre
of
this
enchanted
garden
Madame
Nilsson
,
in
white
*NL*
cashmere
slashed
with
pale
blue
satin
,
a
reticule
dangling
from
a
blue
*NL*
girdle
,
and
large
yellow
braids
carefully
disposed
on
each
side
of
her
*NL*
muslin
chemisette
,
listened
with
downcast
eyes
to
M.
Capoul
's
*NL*
impassioned
wooing
,
and
affected
a
guileless
incomprehension
of
his
*NL*
designs
whenever
,
by
word
or
glance
,
he
persuasively
indicated
the
*NL*
ground
floor
window
of
the
neat
brick
villa
projecting
obliquely
from
*NL*
the
right
wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
darling
!
''
thought
Newland
Archer
,
his
glance
flitting
back
to
the
*NL*
young
girl
with
the
lilies-of-the-valley
.
``
She
does
n't
even
guess
what
*NL*
it
's
all
about
.
''
And
he
contemplated
her
absorbed
young
face
with
a
*NL*
thrill
of
possessorship
in
which
pride
in
his
own
masculine
initiation
*NL*
was
mingled
with
a
tender
reverence
for
her
abysmal
purity
.
``
We
'll
*NL*
read
Faust
together
...
by
the
Italian
lakes
...
''
he
thought
,
somewhat
*NL*
hazily
confusing
the
scene
of
his
projected
honey-moon
with
the
*NL*
masterpieces
of
literature
which
it
would
be
his
manly
privilege
to
*NL*
reveal
to
his
bride
.
It
was
only
that
afternoon
that
May
Welland
had
*NL*
let
him
guess
that
she
``
cared
''
-LRB-
New
York
's
consecrated
phrase
of
maiden
*NL*
avowal
-RRB-
,
and
already
his
imagination
,
leaping
ahead
of
the
engagement
*NL*
ring
,
the
betrothal
kiss
and
the
march
from
Lohengrin
,
pictured
her
at
*NL*
his
side
in
some
scene
of
old
European
witchery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
in
the
least
wish
the
future
Mrs.
Newland
Archer
to
be
a
*NL*
simpleton
.
He
meant
her
-LRB-
thanks
to
his
enlightening
companionship
-RRB-
to
*NL*
develop
a
social
tact
and
readiness
of
wit
enabling
her
to
hold
her
own
*NL*
with
the
most
popular
married
women
of
the
``
younger
set
,
''
in
which
it
*NL*
was
the
recognised
custom
to
attract
masculine
homage
while
playfully
*NL*
discouraging
it
.
If
he
had
probed
to
the
bottom
of
his
vanity
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
sometimes
nearly
did
-RRB-
he
would
have
found
there
the
wish
that
his
wife
*NL*
should
be
as
worldly-wise
and
as
eager
to
please
as
the
married
lady
*NL*
whose
charms
had
held
his
fancy
through
two
mildly
agitated
years
;
*NL*
without
,
of
course
,
any
hint
of
the
frailty
which
had
so
nearly
marred
*NL*
that
unhappy
being
's
life
,
and
had
disarranged
his
own
plans
for
a
*NL*
whole
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
this
miracle
of
fire
and
ice
was
to
be
created
,
and
to
sustain
*NL*
itself
in
a
harsh
world
,
he
had
never
taken
the
time
to
think
out
;
but
*NL*
he
was
content
to
hold
his
view
without
analysing
it
,
since
he
knew
it
*NL*
was
that
of
all
the
carefully-brushed
,
white-waistcoated
,
*NL*
button-hole-flowered
gentlemen
who
succeeded
each
other
in
the
club
*NL*
box
,
exchanged
friendly
greetings
with
him
,
and
turned
their
*NL*
opera-glasses
critically
on
the
circle
of
ladies
who
were
the
product
*NL*
of
the
system
.
In
matters
intellectual
and
artistic
Newland
Archer
*NL*
felt
himself
distinctly
the
superior
of
these
chosen
specimens
of
old
*NL*
New
York
gentility
;
he
had
probably
read
more
,
thought
more
,
and
even
*NL*
seen
a
good
deal
more
of
the
world
,
than
any
other
man
of
the
number
.
*NL*
Singly
they
betrayed
their
inferiority
;
but
grouped
together
they
*NL*
represented
``
New
York
,
''
and
the
habit
of
masculine
solidarity
made
him
*NL*
accept
their
doctrine
on
all
the
issues
called
moral
.
He
instinctively
*NL*
felt
that
in
this
respect
it
would
be
troublesome
--
and
also
rather
bad
*NL*
form
--
to
strike
out
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
upon
my
soul
!
''
exclaimed
Lawrence
Lefferts
,
turning
his
*NL*
opera-glass
abruptly
away
from
the
stage
.
Lawrence
Lefferts
was
,
on
*NL*
the
whole
,
the
foremost
authority
on
``
form
''
in
New
York
.
He
had
*NL*
probably
devoted
more
time
than
any
one
else
to
the
study
of
this
*NL*
intricate
and
fascinating
question
;
but
study
alone
could
not
account
*NL*
for
his
complete
and
easy
competence
.
One
had
only
to
look
at
him
,
*NL*
from
the
slant
of
his
bald
forehead
and
the
curve
of
his
beautiful
fair
*NL*
moustache
to
the
long
patent-leather
feet
at
the
other
end
of
his
lean
*NL*
and
elegant
person
,
to
feel
that
the
knowledge
of
``
form
''
must
be
*NL*
congenital
in
any
one
who
knew
how
to
wear
such
good
clothes
so
*NL*
carelessly
and
carry
such
height
with
so
much
lounging
grace
.
As
a
*NL*
young
admirer
had
once
said
of
him
:
``
If
anybody
can
tell
a
fellow
just
*NL*
when
to
wear
a
black
tie
with
evening
clothes
and
when
not
to
,
it
's
*NL*
Larry
Lefferts
.
''
And
on
the
question
of
pumps
versus
patent-leather
*NL*
``
Oxfords
''
his
authority
had
never
been
disputed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
''
he
said
;
and
silently
handed
his
glass
to
old
Sillerton
*NL*
Jackson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
following
Lefferts
's
glance
,
saw
with
surprise
that
his
*NL*
exclamation
had
been
occasioned
by
the
entry
of
a
new
figure
into
old
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
's
box
.
It
was
that
of
a
slim
young
woman
,
a
little
less
*NL*
tall
than
May
Welland
,
with
brown
hair
growing
in
close
curls
about
her
*NL*
temples
and
held
in
place
by
a
narrow
band
of
diamonds
.
The
suggestion
*NL*
of
this
headdress
,
which
gave
her
what
was
then
called
a
``
Josephine
*NL*
look
,
''
was
carried
out
in
the
cut
of
the
dark
blue
velvet
gown
rather
*NL*
theatrically
caught
up
under
her
bosom
by
a
girdle
with
a
large
*NL*
old-fashioned
clasp
.
The
wearer
of
this
unusual
dress
,
who
seemed
*NL*
quite
unconscious
of
the
attention
it
was
attracting
,
stood
a
moment
in
*NL*
the
centre
of
the
box
,
discussing
with
Mrs.
Welland
the
propriety
of
*NL*
taking
the
latter
's
place
in
the
front
right-hand
corner
;
then
she
*NL*
yielded
with
a
slight
smile
,
and
seated
herself
in
line
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
's
sister-in-law
,
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
,
who
was
installed
in
the
*NL*
opposite
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
had
returned
the
opera-glass
to
Lawrence
*NL*
Lefferts
.
The
whole
of
the
club
turned
instinctively
,
waiting
to
hear
*NL*
what
the
old
man
had
to
say
;
for
old
Mr.
Jackson
was
as
great
an
*NL*
authority
on
``
family
''
as
Lawrence
Lefferts
was
on
``
form
.
''
He
knew
all
*NL*
the
ramifications
of
New
York
's
cousinships
;
and
could
not
only
*NL*
elucidate
such
complicated
questions
as
that
of
the
connection
between
*NL*
the
Mingotts
-LRB-
through
the
Thorleys
-RRB-
with
the
Dallases
of
South
*NL*
Carolina
,
and
that
of
the
relationship
of
the
elder
branch
of
*NL*
Philadelphia
Thorleys
to
the
Albany
Chiverses
-LRB-
on
no
account
to
be
*NL*
confused
with
the
Manson
Chiverses
of
University
Place
-RRB-
,
but
could
also
*NL*
enumerate
the
leading
characteristics
of
each
family
:
as
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
the
fabulous
stinginess
of
the
younger
lines
of
Leffertses
-LRB-
the
Long
*NL*
Island
ones
-RRB-
;
or
the
fatal
tendency
of
the
Rushworths
to
make
foolish
*NL*
matches
;
or
the
insanity
recurring
in
every
second
generation
of
the
*NL*
Albany
Chiverses
,
with
whom
their
New
York
cousins
had
always
refused
*NL*
to
intermarry
--
with
the
disastrous
exception
of
poor
Medora
Manson
,
*NL*
who
,
as
everybody
knew
...
but
then
her
mother
was
a
Rushworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
forest
of
family
trees
,
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
*NL*
carried
between
his
narrow
hollow
temples
,
and
under
his
soft
thatch
of
*NL*
silver
hair
,
a
register
of
most
of
the
scandals
and
mysteries
that
had
*NL*
smouldered
under
the
unruffled
surface
of
New
York
society
within
the
*NL*
last
fifty
years
.
So
far
indeed
did
his
information
extend
,
and
so
*NL*
acutely
retentive
was
his
memory
,
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
only
*NL*
man
who
could
have
told
you
who
Julius
Beaufort
,
the
banker
,
really
*NL*
was
,
and
what
had
become
of
handsome
Bob
Spicer
,
old
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
's
father
,
who
had
disappeared
so
mysteriously
-LRB-
with
a
large
sum
*NL*
of
trust
money
-RRB-
less
than
a
year
after
his
marriage
,
on
the
very
day
*NL*
that
a
beautiful
Spanish
dancer
who
had
been
delighting
thronged
*NL*
audiences
in
the
old
Opera-house
on
the
Battery
had
taken
ship
for
*NL*
Cuba
.
But
these
mysteries
,
and
many
others
,
were
closely
locked
in
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
's
breast
;
for
not
only
did
his
keen
sense
of
honour
forbid
his
*NL*
repeating
anything
privately
imparted
,
but
he
was
fully
aware
that
his
*NL*
reputation
for
discretion
increased
his
opportunities
of
finding
out
*NL*
what
he
wanted
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
club
box
,
therefore
,
waited
in
visible
suspense
while
Mr.
Sillerton
*NL*
Jackson
handed
back
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
opera-glass
.
For
a
moment
he
*NL*
silently
scrutinised
the
attentive
group
out
of
his
filmy
blue
eyes
*NL*
overhung
by
old
veined
lids
;
then
he
gave
his
moustache
a
thoughtful
*NL*
twist
,
and
said
simply
:
``
I
did
n't
think
the
Mingotts
would
have
tried
*NL*
it
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
during
this
brief
episode
,
had
been
thrown
into
a
*NL*
strange
state
of
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
annoying
that
the
box
which
was
thus
attracting
the
undivided
*NL*
attention
of
masculine
New
York
should
be
that
in
which
his
betrothed
*NL*
was
seated
between
her
mother
and
aunt
;
and
for
a
moment
he
could
not
*NL*
identify
the
lady
in
the
Empire
dress
,
nor
imagine
why
her
presence
*NL*
created
such
excitement
among
the
initiated
.
Then
light
dawned
on
him
,
*NL*
and
with
it
came
a
momentary
rush
of
indignation
.
No
,
indeed
;
no
one
*NL*
would
have
thought
the
Mingotts
would
have
tried
it
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
had
;
they
undoubtedly
had
;
for
the
low-toned
comments
behind
*NL*
him
left
no
doubt
in
Archer
's
mind
that
the
young
woman
was
May
*NL*
Welland
's
cousin
,
the
cousin
always
referred
to
in
the
family
as
``
poor
*NL*
Ellen
Olenska
.
''
Archer
knew
that
she
had
suddenly
arrived
from
Europe
*NL*
a
day
or
two
previously
;
he
had
even
heard
from
Miss
Welland
-LRB-
not
*NL*
disapprovingly
-RRB-
that
she
had
been
to
see
poor
Ellen
,
who
was
staying
*NL*
with
old
Mrs.
Mingott
.
Archer
entirely
approved
of
family
solidarity
,
*NL*
and
one
of
the
qualities
he
most
admired
in
the
Mingotts
was
their
*NL*
resolute
championship
of
the
few
black
sheep
that
their
blameless
stock
*NL*
had
produced
.
There
was
nothing
mean
or
ungenerous
in
the
young
man
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
he
was
glad
that
his
future
wife
should
not
be
restrained
by
*NL*
false
prudery
from
being
kind
-LRB-
in
private
-RRB-
to
her
unhappy
cousin
;
but
*NL*
to
receive
Countess
Olenska
in
the
family
circle
was
a
different
thing
*NL*
from
producing
her
in
public
,
at
the
Opera
of
all
places
,
and
in
the
*NL*
very
box
with
the
young
girl
whose
engagement
to
him
,
Newland
Archer
,
*NL*
was
to
be
announced
within
a
few
weeks
.
No
,
he
felt
as
old
Sillerton
*NL*
Jackson
felt
;
he
did
not
think
the
Mingotts
would
have
tried
it
on
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
,
of
course
,
that
whatever
man
dared
-LRB-
within
Fifth
Avenue
's
*NL*
limits
-RRB-
that
old
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
,
the
Matriarch
of
the
line
,
would
*NL*
dare
.
He
had
always
admired
the
high
and
mighty
old
lady
,
who
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
having
been
only
Catherine
Spicer
of
Staten
Island
,
with
a
*NL*
father
mysteriously
discredited
,
and
neither
money
nor
position
enough
*NL*
to
make
people
forget
it
,
had
allied
herself
with
the
head
of
the
*NL*
wealthy
Mingott
line
,
married
two
of
her
daughters
to
``
foreigners
''
-LRB-
an
*NL*
Italian
marquis
and
an
English
banker
-RRB-
,
and
put
the
crowning
touch
to
*NL*
her
audacities
by
building
a
large
house
of
pale
cream-coloured
stone
*NL*
-LRB-
when
brown
sandstone
seemed
as
much
the
only
wear
as
a
frock-coat
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
-RRB-
in
an
inaccessible
wilderness
near
the
Central
Park
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
foreign
daughters
had
become
a
legend
.
They
never
*NL*
came
back
to
see
their
mother
,
and
the
latter
being
,
like
many
persons
*NL*
of
active
mind
and
dominating
will
,
sedentary
and
corpulent
in
her
*NL*
habit
,
had
philosophically
remained
at
home
.
But
the
cream-coloured
*NL*
house
-LRB-
supposed
to
be
modelled
on
the
private
hotels
of
the
Parisian
*NL*
aristocracy
-RRB-
was
there
as
a
visible
proof
of
her
moral
courage
;
and
she
*NL*
throned
in
it
,
among
pre-Revolutionary
furniture
and
souvenirs
of
the
*NL*
Tuileries
of
Louis
Napoleon
-LRB-
where
she
had
shone
in
her
middle
age
-RRB-
,
as
*NL*
placidly
as
if
there
were
nothing
peculiar
in
living
above
*NL*
Thirty-fourth
Street
,
or
in
having
French
windows
that
opened
like
*NL*
doors
instead
of
sashes
that
pushed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
-LRB-
including
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
-RRB-
was
agreed
that
old
*NL*
Catherine
had
never
had
beauty
--
a
gift
which
,
in
the
eyes
of
New
York
,
*NL*
justified
every
success
,
and
excused
a
certain
number
of
failings
.
*NL*
Unkind
people
said
that
,
like
her
Imperial
namesake
,
she
had
won
her
*NL*
way
to
success
by
strength
of
will
and
hardness
of
heart
,
and
a
kind
of
*NL*
haughty
effrontery
that
was
somehow
justified
by
the
extreme
decency
*NL*
and
dignity
of
her
private
life
.
Mr.
Manson
Mingott
had
died
when
she
*NL*
was
only
twenty-eight
,
and
had
``
tied
up
''
the
money
with
an
additional
*NL*
caution
born
of
the
general
distrust
of
the
Spicers
;
but
his
bold
young
*NL*
widow
went
her
way
fearlessly
,
mingled
freely
in
foreign
society
,
*NL*
married
her
daughters
in
heaven
knew
what
corrupt
and
fashionable
*NL*
circles
,
hobnobbed
with
Dukes
and
Ambassadors
,
associated
familiarly
*NL*
with
Papists
,
entertained
Opera
singers
,
and
was
the
intimate
friend
of
*NL*
Mme.
Taglioni
;
and
all
the
while
-LRB-
as
Sillerton
Jackson
was
the
first
to
*NL*
proclaim
-RRB-
there
had
never
been
a
breath
on
her
reputation
;
the
only
*NL*
respect
,
he
always
added
,
in
which
she
differed
from
the
earlier
*NL*
Catherine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
had
long
since
succeeded
in
untying
her
husband
's
*NL*
fortune
,
and
had
lived
in
affluence
for
half
a
century
;
but
memories
of
*NL*
her
early
straits
had
made
her
excessively
thrifty
,
and
though
,
when
*NL*
she
bought
a
dress
or
a
piece
of
furniture
,
she
took
care
that
it
*NL*
should
be
of
the
best
,
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
spend
much
on
the
*NL*
transient
pleasures
of
the
table
.
Therefore
,
for
totally
different
*NL*
reasons
,
her
food
was
as
poor
as
Mrs.
Archer
's
,
and
her
wines
did
*NL*
nothing
to
redeem
it
.
Her
relatives
considered
that
the
penury
of
her
*NL*
table
discredited
the
Mingott
name
,
which
had
always
been
associated
*NL*
with
good
living
;
but
people
continued
to
come
to
her
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
``
made
dishes
''
and
flat
champagne
,
and
in
reply
to
the
remonstrances
of
*NL*
her
son
Lovell
-LRB-
who
tried
to
retrieve
the
family
credit
by
having
the
*NL*
best
chef
in
New
York
-RRB-
she
used
to
say
laughingly
:
``
What
's
the
use
of
*NL*
two
good
cooks
in
one
family
,
now
that
I
've
married
the
girls
and
ca
n't
*NL*
eat
sauces
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
as
he
mused
on
these
things
,
had
once
more
turned
his
*NL*
eyes
toward
the
Mingott
box
.
He
saw
that
Mrs.
Welland
and
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
were
facing
their
semicircle
of
critics
with
the
*NL*
Mingottian
APLOMB
which
old
Catherine
had
inculcated
in
all
her
tribe
,
*NL*
and
that
only
May
Welland
betrayed
,
by
a
heightened
colour
-LRB-
perhaps
due
*NL*
to
the
knowledge
that
he
was
watching
her
-RRB-
a
sense
of
the
gravity
of
*NL*
the
situation
.
As
for
the
cause
of
the
commotion
,
she
sat
gracefully
*NL*
in
her
corner
of
the
box
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
stage
,
and
revealing
,
*NL*
as
she
leaned
forward
,
a
little
more
shoulder
and
bosom
than
New
York
*NL*
was
accustomed
to
seeing
,
at
least
in
ladies
who
had
reasons
for
*NL*
wishing
to
pass
unnoticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
things
seemed
to
Newland
Archer
more
awful
than
an
offence
against
*NL*
``
Taste
,
''
that
far-off
divinity
of
whom
``
Form
''
was
the
mere
visible
*NL*
representative
and
vicegerent
.
Madame
Olenska
's
pale
and
serious
face
*NL*
appealed
to
his
fancy
as
suited
to
the
occasion
and
to
her
unhappy
*NL*
situation
;
but
the
way
her
dress
-LRB-
which
had
no
tucker
-RRB-
sloped
away
from
*NL*
her
thin
shoulders
shocked
and
troubled
him
.
He
hated
to
think
of
May
*NL*
Welland
's
being
exposed
to
the
influence
of
a
young
woman
so
careless
*NL*
of
the
dictates
of
Taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
he
heard
one
of
the
younger
men
begin
behind
him
*NL*
-LRB-
everybody
talked
through
the
Mephistopheles-and-Martha
scenes
-RRB-
,
``
after
*NL*
all
,
just
WHAT
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
she
left
him
;
nobody
attempts
to
deny
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
awful
brute
,
is
n't
he
?
''
continued
the
young
enquirer
,
a
candid
*NL*
Thorley
,
who
was
evidently
preparing
to
enter
the
lists
as
the
lady
's
*NL*
champion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
worst
;
I
knew
him
at
Nice
,
''
said
Lawrence
Lefferts
with
*NL*
authority
.
``
A
half-paralysed
white
sneering
fellow
--
rather
handsome
*NL*
head
,
but
eyes
with
a
lot
of
lashes
.
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
sort
:
*NL*
when
he
was
n't
with
women
he
was
collecting
china
.
Paying
any
price
*NL*
for
both
,
I
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
laugh
,
and
the
young
champion
said
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
then
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
;
she
bolted
with
his
secretary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
.
''
The
champion
's
face
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
did
n't
last
long
,
though
:
I
heard
of
her
a
few
months
later
living
*NL*
alone
in
Venice
.
I
believe
Lovell
Mingott
went
out
to
get
her
.
He
*NL*
said
she
was
desperately
unhappy
.
That
's
all
right
--
but
this
parading
*NL*
her
at
the
Opera
's
another
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
young
Thorley
hazarded
,
``
she
's
too
unhappy
to
be
left
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
greeted
with
an
irreverent
laugh
,
and
the
youth
blushed
*NL*
deeply
,
and
tried
to
look
as
if
he
had
meant
to
insinuate
what
knowing
*NL*
people
called
a
``
double
entendre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
's
queer
to
have
brought
Miss
Welland
,
anyhow
,
''
some
one
said
*NL*
in
a
low
tone
,
with
a
side-glance
at
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
part
of
the
campaign
:
Granny
's
orders
,
no
doubt
,
''
Lefferts
*NL*
laughed
.
``
When
the
old
lady
does
a
thing
she
does
it
thoroughly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
act
was
ending
,
and
there
was
a
general
stir
in
the
box
.
Suddenly
*NL*
Newland
Archer
felt
himself
impelled
to
decisive
action
.
The
desire
to
*NL*
be
the
first
man
to
enter
Mrs.
Mingott
's
box
,
to
proclaim
to
the
*NL*
waiting
world
his
engagement
to
May
Welland
,
and
to
see
her
through
*NL*
whatever
difficulties
her
cousin
's
anomalous
situation
might
involve
*NL*
her
in
;
this
impulse
had
abruptly
overruled
all
scruples
and
*NL*
hesitations
,
and
sent
him
hurrying
through
the
red
corridors
to
the
*NL*
farther
side
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
entered
the
box
his
eyes
met
Miss
Welland
's
,
and
he
saw
that
she
*NL*
had
instantly
understood
his
motive
,
though
the
family
dignity
which
*NL*
both
considered
so
high
a
virtue
would
not
permit
her
to
tell
him
so
.
*NL*
The
persons
of
their
world
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
faint
implications
*NL*
and
pale
delicacies
,
and
the
fact
that
he
and
she
understood
each
other
*NL*
without
a
word
seemed
to
the
young
man
to
bring
them
nearer
than
any
*NL*
explanation
would
have
done
.
Her
eyes
said
:
``
You
see
why
Mamma
*NL*
brought
me
,
''
and
his
answered
:
``
I
would
not
for
the
world
have
had
you
*NL*
stay
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
my
niece
Countess
Olenska
?
''
Mrs.
Welland
enquired
as
she
*NL*
shook
hands
with
her
future
son-in-law
.
Archer
bowed
without
extending
*NL*
his
hand
,
as
was
the
custom
on
being
introduced
to
a
lady
;
and
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
bent
her
head
slightly
,
keeping
her
own
pale-gloved
hands
*NL*
clasped
on
her
huge
fan
of
eagle
feathers
.
Having
greeted
Mrs.
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
,
a
large
blonde
lady
in
creaking
satin
,
he
sat
down
beside
his
*NL*
betrothed
,
and
said
in
a
low
tone
:
``
I
hope
you
've
told
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
that
we
're
engaged
?
I
want
everybody
to
know
--
I
want
you
to
let
me
*NL*
announce
it
this
evening
at
the
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Welland
's
face
grew
rosy
as
the
dawn
,
and
she
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
radiant
eyes
.
``
If
you
can
persuade
Mamma
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
why
should
*NL*
we
change
what
is
already
settled
?
''
He
made
no
answer
but
that
which
*NL*
his
eyes
returned
,
and
she
added
,
still
more
confidently
smiling
:
*NL*
``
Tell
my
cousin
yourself
:
I
give
you
leave
.
She
says
she
used
to
play
*NL*
with
you
when
you
were
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
way
for
him
by
pushing
back
her
chair
,
and
promptly
,
and
a
*NL*
little
ostentatiously
,
with
the
desire
that
the
whole
house
should
see
*NL*
what
he
was
doing
,
Archer
seated
himself
at
the
Countess
Olenska
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
DID
use
to
play
together
,
did
n't
we
?
''
she
asked
,
turning
her
grave
*NL*
eyes
to
his
.
``
You
were
a
horrid
boy
,
and
kissed
me
once
behind
a
door
;
*NL*
but
it
was
your
cousin
Vandie
Newland
,
who
never
looked
at
me
,
that
I
*NL*
was
in
love
with
.
''
Her
glance
swept
the
horse-shoe
curve
of
boxes
.
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
this
brings
it
all
back
to
me
--
I
see
everybody
here
in
*NL*
knickerbockers
and
pantalettes
,
''
she
said
,
with
her
trailing
slightly
*NL*
foreign
accent
,
her
eyes
returning
to
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agreeable
as
their
expression
was
,
the
young
man
was
shocked
that
they
*NL*
should
reflect
so
unseemly
a
picture
of
the
august
tribunal
before
*NL*
which
,
at
that
very
moment
,
her
case
was
being
tried
.
Nothing
could
be
*NL*
in
worse
taste
than
misplaced
flippancy
;
and
he
answered
somewhat
*NL*
stiffly
:
``
Yes
,
you
have
been
away
a
very
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
centuries
and
centuries
;
so
long
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
I
'm
sure
I
'm
*NL*
dead
and
buried
,
and
this
dear
old
place
is
heaven
;
''
which
,
for
reasons
*NL*
he
could
not
define
,
struck
Newland
Archer
as
an
even
more
*NL*
disrespectful
way
of
describing
New
York
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
invariably
happened
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Julius
Beaufort
,
on
the
night
of
her
annual
ball
,
never
failed
to
*NL*
appear
at
the
Opera
;
indeed
,
she
always
gave
her
ball
on
an
Opera
night
*NL*
in
order
to
emphasise
her
complete
superiority
to
household
cares
,
and
*NL*
her
possession
of
a
staff
of
servants
competent
to
organise
every
*NL*
detail
of
the
entertainment
in
her
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Beauforts
'
house
was
one
of
the
few
in
New
York
that
possessed
a
*NL*
ball-room
-LRB-
it
antedated
even
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
and
the
Headly
*NL*
Chiverses
'
-RRB-
;
and
at
a
time
when
it
was
beginning
to
be
thought
*NL*
``
provincial
''
to
put
a
``
crash
''
over
the
drawing-room
floor
and
move
the
*NL*
furniture
upstairs
,
the
possession
of
a
ball-room
that
was
used
for
no
*NL*
other
purpose
,
and
left
for
three-hundred-and-sixty-four
days
of
the
*NL*
year
to
shuttered
darkness
,
with
its
gilt
chairs
stacked
in
a
corner
*NL*
and
its
chandelier
in
a
bag
;
this
undoubted
superiority
was
felt
to
*NL*
compensate
for
whatever
was
regrettable
in
the
Beaufort
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
,
who
was
fond
of
coining
her
social
philosophy
into
axioms
,
*NL*
had
once
said
:
``
We
all
have
our
pet
common
people
--
''
and
though
the
*NL*
phrase
was
a
daring
one
,
its
truth
was
secretly
admitted
in
many
an
*NL*
exclusive
bosom
.
But
the
Beauforts
were
not
exactly
common
;
some
*NL*
people
said
they
were
even
worse
.
Mrs.
Beaufort
belonged
indeed
to
one
*NL*
of
America
's
most
honoured
families
;
she
had
been
the
lovely
Regina
*NL*
Dallas
-LRB-
of
the
South
Carolina
branch
-RRB-
,
a
penniless
beauty
introduced
to
*NL*
New
York
society
by
her
cousin
,
the
imprudent
Medora
Manson
,
who
was
*NL*
always
doing
the
wrong
thing
from
the
right
motive
.
When
one
was
*NL*
related
to
the
Mansons
and
the
Rushworths
one
had
a
``
droit
de
cite
''
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
,
who
had
frequented
the
Tuileries
,
called
it
-RRB-
in
*NL*
New
York
society
;
but
did
one
not
forfeit
it
in
marrying
Julius
*NL*
Beaufort
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
:
who
was
Beaufort
?
He
passed
for
an
Englishman
,
was
*NL*
agreeable
,
handsome
,
ill-tempered
,
hospitable
and
witty
.
He
had
come
*NL*
to
America
with
letters
of
recommendation
from
old
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
's
English
son-in-law
,
the
banker
,
and
had
speedily
made
himself
*NL*
an
important
position
in
the
world
of
affairs
;
but
his
habits
were
*NL*
dissipated
,
his
tongue
was
bitter
,
his
antecedents
were
mysterious
;
and
*NL*
when
Medora
Manson
announced
her
cousin
's
engagement
to
him
it
was
felt
*NL*
to
be
one
more
act
of
folly
in
poor
Medora
's
long
record
of
imprudences
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
folly
is
as
often
justified
of
her
children
as
wisdom
,
and
two
*NL*
years
after
young
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
marriage
it
was
admitted
that
she
had
*NL*
the
most
distinguished
house
in
New
York
.
No
one
knew
exactly
how
the
*NL*
miracle
was
accomplished
.
She
was
indolent
,
passive
,
the
caustic
even
*NL*
called
her
dull
;
but
dressed
like
an
idol
,
hung
with
pearls
,
growing
*NL*
younger
and
blonder
and
more
beautiful
each
year
,
she
throned
in
Mr.
*NL*
Beaufort
's
heavy
brown-stone
palace
,
and
drew
all
the
world
there
*NL*
without
lifting
her
jewelled
little
finger
.
The
knowing
people
said
it
*NL*
was
Beaufort
himself
who
trained
the
servants
,
taught
the
chef
new
*NL*
dishes
,
told
the
gardeners
what
hot-house
flowers
to
grow
for
the
*NL*
dinner-table
and
the
drawing-rooms
,
selected
the
guests
,
brewed
the
*NL*
after-dinner
punch
and
dictated
the
little
notes
his
wife
wrote
to
her
*NL*
friends
.
If
he
did
,
these
domestic
activities
were
privately
*NL*
performed
,
and
he
presented
to
the
world
the
appearance
of
a
careless
*NL*
and
hospitable
millionaire
strolling
into
his
own
drawing-room
with
the
*NL*
detachment
of
an
invited
guest
,
and
saying
:
``
My
wife
's
gloxinias
are
a
*NL*
marvel
,
are
n't
they
?
I
believe
she
gets
them
out
from
Kew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Beaufort
's
secret
,
people
were
agreed
,
was
the
way
he
carried
*NL*
things
off
.
It
was
all
very
well
to
whisper
that
he
had
been
``
helped
''
*NL*
to
leave
England
by
the
international
banking-house
in
which
he
had
*NL*
been
employed
;
he
carried
off
that
rumour
as
easily
as
the
rest
--
though
*NL*
New
York
's
business
conscience
was
no
less
sensitive
than
its
moral
*NL*
standard
--
he
carried
everything
before
him
,
and
all
New
York
into
his
*NL*
drawing-rooms
,
and
for
over
twenty
years
now
people
had
said
they
were
*NL*
``
going
to
the
Beauforts
'
''
with
the
same
tone
of
security
as
if
they
had
*NL*
said
they
were
going
to
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
,
and
with
the
added
*NL*
satisfaction
of
knowing
they
would
get
hot
canvas-back
ducks
and
*NL*
vintage
wines
,
instead
of
tepid
Veuve
Clicquot
without
a
year
and
*NL*
warmed-up
croquettes
from
Philadelphia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Beaufort
,
then
,
had
as
usual
appeared
in
her
box
just
before
the
*NL*
Jewel
Song
;
and
when
,
again
as
usual
,
she
rose
at
the
end
of
the
third
*NL*
act
,
drew
her
opera
cloak
about
her
lovely
shoulders
,
and
disappeared
,
*NL*
New
York
knew
that
meant
that
half
an
hour
later
the
ball
would
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Beaufort
house
was
one
that
New
Yorkers
were
proud
to
show
to
*NL*
foreigners
,
especially
on
the
night
of
the
annual
ball
.
The
Beauforts
*NL*
had
been
among
the
first
people
in
New
York
to
own
their
own
red
velvet
*NL*
carpet
and
have
it
rolled
down
the
steps
by
their
own
footmen
,
under
*NL*
their
own
awning
,
instead
of
hiring
it
with
the
supper
and
the
*NL*
ball-room
chairs
.
They
had
also
inaugurated
the
custom
of
letting
the
*NL*
ladies
take
their
cloaks
off
in
the
hall
,
instead
of
shuffling
up
to
*NL*
the
hostess
's
bedroom
and
recurling
their
hair
with
the
aid
of
the
*NL*
gas-burner
;
Beaufort
was
understood
to
have
said
that
he
supposed
all
*NL*
his
wife
's
friends
had
maids
who
saw
to
it
that
they
were
properly
*NL*
coiffees
when
they
left
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
house
had
been
boldly
planned
with
a
ball-room
,
so
that
,
*NL*
instead
of
squeezing
through
a
narrow
passage
to
get
to
it
-LRB-
as
at
the
*NL*
Chiverses
'
-RRB-
one
marched
solemnly
down
a
vista
of
enfiladed
*NL*
drawing-rooms
-LRB-
the
sea-green
,
the
crimson
and
the
bouton
d'or
-RRB-
,
seeing
*NL*
from
afar
the
many-candled
lustres
reflected
in
the
polished
parquetry
,
*NL*
and
beyond
that
the
depths
of
a
conservatory
where
camellias
and
*NL*
tree-ferns
arched
their
costly
foliage
over
seats
of
black
and
gold
*NL*
bamboo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
as
became
a
young
man
of
his
position
,
strolled
in
*NL*
somewhat
late
.
He
had
left
his
overcoat
with
the
silk-stockinged
*NL*
footmen
-LRB-
the
stockings
were
one
of
Beaufort
's
few
fatuities
-RRB-
,
had
*NL*
dawdled
a
while
in
the
library
hung
with
Spanish
leather
and
furnished
*NL*
with
Buhl
and
malachite
,
where
a
few
men
were
chatting
and
putting
on
*NL*
their
dancing-gloves
,
and
had
finally
joined
the
line
of
guests
whom
*NL*
Mrs.
Beaufort
was
receiving
on
the
threshold
of
the
crimson
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
distinctly
nervous
.
He
had
not
gone
back
to
his
club
after
*NL*
the
Opera
-LRB-
as
the
young
bloods
usually
did
-RRB-
,
but
,
the
night
being
fine
,
*NL*
had
walked
for
some
distance
up
Fifth
Avenue
before
turning
back
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Beauforts
'
house
.
He
was
definitely
afraid
that
the
*NL*
Mingotts
might
be
going
too
far
;
that
,
in
fact
,
they
might
have
Granny
*NL*
Mingott
's
orders
to
bring
the
Countess
Olenska
to
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
tone
of
the
club
box
he
had
perceived
how
grave
a
mistake
that
*NL*
would
be
;
and
,
though
he
was
more
than
ever
determined
to
``
see
the
*NL*
thing
through
,
''
he
felt
less
chivalrously
eager
to
champion
his
*NL*
betrothed
's
cousin
than
before
their
brief
talk
at
the
Opera
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wandering
on
to
the
bouton
d'or
drawing-room
-LRB-
where
Beaufort
had
had
*NL*
the
audacity
to
hang
``
Love
Victorious
,
''
the
much-discussed
nude
of
*NL*
Bouguereau
-RRB-
Archer
found
Mrs.
Welland
and
her
daughter
standing
near
*NL*
the
ball-room
door
.
Couples
were
already
gliding
over
the
floor
*NL*
beyond
:
the
light
of
the
wax
candles
fell
on
revolving
tulle
skirts
,
on
*NL*
girlish
heads
wreathed
with
modest
blossoms
,
on
the
dashing
aigrettes
*NL*
and
ornaments
of
the
young
married
women
's
coiffures
,
and
on
the
*NL*
glitter
of
highly
glazed
shirt-fronts
and
fresh
glace
gloves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Welland
,
evidently
about
to
join
the
dancers
,
hung
on
the
*NL*
threshold
,
her
lilies-of-the-valley
in
her
hand
-LRB-
she
carried
no
other
*NL*
bouquet
-RRB-
,
her
face
a
little
pale
,
her
eyes
burning
with
a
candid
*NL*
excitement
.
A
group
of
young
men
and
girls
were
gathered
about
her
,
*NL*
and
there
was
much
hand-clasping
,
laughing
and
pleasantry
on
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
,
standing
slightly
apart
,
shed
the
beam
of
a
qualified
*NL*
approval
.
It
was
evident
that
Miss
Welland
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
announcing
her
engagement
,
while
her
mother
affected
the
air
of
*NL*
parental
reluctance
considered
suitable
to
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
paused
a
moment
.
It
was
at
his
express
wish
that
the
*NL*
announcement
had
been
made
,
and
yet
it
was
not
thus
that
he
would
have
*NL*
wished
to
have
his
happiness
known
.
To
proclaim
it
in
the
heat
and
*NL*
noise
of
a
crowded
ball-room
was
to
rob
it
of
the
fine
bloom
of
privacy
*NL*
which
should
belong
to
things
nearest
the
heart
.
His
joy
was
so
deep
*NL*
that
this
blurring
of
the
surface
left
its
essence
untouched
;
but
he
*NL*
would
have
liked
to
keep
the
surface
pure
too
.
It
was
something
of
a
*NL*
satisfaction
to
find
that
May
Welland
shared
this
feeling
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
fled
to
his
beseechingly
,
and
their
look
said
:
``
Remember
,
we
're
doing
*NL*
this
because
it
's
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
appeal
could
have
found
a
more
immediate
response
in
Archer
's
*NL*
breast
;
but
he
wished
that
the
necessity
of
their
action
had
been
*NL*
represented
by
some
ideal
reason
,
and
not
simply
by
poor
Ellen
Olenska
.
*NL*
The
group
about
Miss
Welland
made
way
for
him
with
significant
smiles
,
*NL*
and
after
taking
his
share
of
the
felicitations
he
drew
his
betrothed
*NL*
into
the
middle
of
the
ball-room
floor
and
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
sha
n't
have
to
talk
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
into
her
candid
eyes
,
as
*NL*
they
floated
away
on
the
soft
waves
of
the
Blue
Danube
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
.
Her
lips
trembled
into
a
smile
,
but
the
eyes
*NL*
remained
distant
and
serious
,
as
if
bent
on
some
ineffable
vision
.
*NL*
``
Dear
,
''
Archer
whispered
,
pressing
her
to
him
:
it
was
borne
in
on
him
*NL*
that
the
first
hours
of
being
engaged
,
even
if
spent
in
a
ball-room
,
*NL*
had
in
them
something
grave
and
sacramental
.
What
a
new
life
it
was
*NL*
going
to
be
,
with
this
whiteness
,
radiance
,
goodness
at
one
's
side
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
dance
over
,
the
two
,
as
became
an
affianced
couple
,
wandered
into
*NL*
the
conservatory
;
and
sitting
behind
a
tall
screen
of
tree-ferns
and
*NL*
camellias
Newland
pressed
her
gloved
hand
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
did
as
you
asked
me
to
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
I
could
n't
wait
,
''
he
answered
smiling
.
After
a
moment
he
added
:
*NL*
``
Only
I
wish
it
had
n't
had
to
be
at
a
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
.
''
She
met
his
glance
comprehendingly
.
``
But
after
*NL*
all
--
even
here
we
're
alone
together
,
are
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dearest
--
always
!
''
Archer
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
she
was
always
going
to
understand
;
she
was
always
going
to
*NL*
say
the
right
thing
.
The
discovery
made
the
cup
of
his
bliss
overflow
,
*NL*
and
he
went
on
gaily
:
``
The
worst
of
it
is
that
I
want
to
kiss
you
and
*NL*
I
ca
n't
.
''
As
he
spoke
he
took
a
swift
glance
about
the
conservatory
,
*NL*
assured
himself
of
their
momentary
privacy
,
and
catching
her
to
him
*NL*
laid
a
fugitive
pressure
on
her
lips
.
To
counteract
the
audacity
of
*NL*
this
proceeding
he
led
her
to
a
bamboo
sofa
in
a
less
secluded
part
of
*NL*
the
conservatory
,
and
sitting
down
beside
her
broke
a
*NL*
lily-of-the-valley
from
her
bouquet
.
She
sat
silent
,
and
the
world
lay
*NL*
like
a
sunlit
valley
at
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
tell
my
cousin
Ellen
?
''
she
asked
presently
,
as
if
she
spoke
*NL*
through
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
roused
himself
,
and
remembered
that
he
had
not
done
so
.
Some
*NL*
invincible
repugnance
to
speak
of
such
things
to
the
strange
foreign
*NL*
woman
had
checked
the
words
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
had
n't
the
chance
after
all
,
''
he
said
,
fibbing
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
.
''
She
looked
disappointed
,
but
gently
resolved
on
gaining
her
*NL*
point
.
``
You
must
,
then
,
for
I
did
n't
either
;
and
I
should
n't
like
her
*NL*
to
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
.
But
are
n't
you
,
after
all
,
the
person
to
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pondered
on
this
.
``
If
I
'd
done
it
at
the
right
time
,
yes
:
but
now
*NL*
that
there
's
been
a
delay
I
think
you
must
explain
that
I
'd
asked
you
*NL*
to
tell
her
at
the
Opera
,
before
our
speaking
about
it
to
everybody
*NL*
here
.
Otherwise
she
might
think
I
had
forgotten
her
.
You
see
,
she
's
*NL*
one
of
the
family
,
and
she
's
been
away
so
long
that
she
's
*NL*
rather
--
sensitive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
at
her
glowingly
.
``
Dear
and
great
angel
!
Of
course
I
'll
*NL*
tell
her
.
''
He
glanced
a
trifle
apprehensively
toward
the
crowded
*NL*
ball-room
.
``
But
I
have
n't
seen
her
yet
.
Has
she
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
at
the
last
minute
she
decided
not
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
last
minute
?
''
he
echoed
,
betraying
his
surprise
that
she
should
*NL*
ever
have
considered
the
alternative
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
's
awfully
fond
of
dancing
,
''
the
young
girl
answered
simply
.
*NL*
``
But
suddenly
she
made
up
her
mind
that
her
dress
was
n't
smart
enough
*NL*
for
a
ball
,
though
we
thought
it
so
lovely
;
and
so
my
aunt
had
to
take
*NL*
her
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
''
said
Archer
with
happy
indifference
.
Nothing
about
his
*NL*
betrothed
pleased
him
more
than
her
resolute
determination
to
carry
to
*NL*
its
utmost
limit
that
ritual
of
ignoring
the
``
unpleasant
''
in
which
they
*NL*
had
both
been
brought
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
as
well
as
I
do
,
''
he
reflected
,
``
the
real
reason
of
her
*NL*
cousin
's
staying
away
;
but
I
shall
never
let
her
see
by
the
least
sign
*NL*
that
I
am
conscious
of
there
being
a
shadow
of
a
shade
on
poor
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
's
reputation
.
''

*NL*
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
next
day
the
first
of
the
usual
betrothal
visits
*NL*
were
exchanged
.
The
New
York
ritual
was
precise
and
inflexible
in
such
*NL*
matters
;
and
in
conformity
with
it
Newland
Archer
first
went
with
his
*NL*
mother
and
sister
to
call
on
Mrs.
Welland
,
after
which
he
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
and
May
drove
out
to
old
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
to
receive
that
*NL*
venerable
ancestress
's
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
visit
to
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
was
always
an
amusing
episode
to
the
*NL*
young
man
.
The
house
in
itself
was
already
an
historic
document
,
*NL*
though
not
,
of
course
,
as
venerable
as
certain
other
old
family
houses
*NL*
in
University
Place
and
lower
Fifth
Avenue
.
Those
were
of
the
purest
*NL*
1830
,
with
a
grim
harmony
of
cabbage-rose-garlanded
carpets
,
rosewood
*NL*
consoles
,
round-arched
fire-places
with
black
marble
mantels
,
and
*NL*
immense
glazed
book-cases
of
mahogany
;
whereas
old
Mrs.
Mingott
,
who
*NL*
had
built
her
house
later
,
had
bodily
cast
out
the
massive
furniture
of
*NL*
her
prime
,
and
mingled
with
the
Mingott
heirlooms
the
frivolous
*NL*
upholstery
of
the
Second
Empire
.
It
was
her
habit
to
sit
in
a
window
*NL*
of
her
sitting-room
on
the
ground
floor
,
as
if
watching
calmly
for
life
*NL*
and
fashion
to
flow
northward
to
her
solitary
doors
.
She
seemed
in
no
*NL*
hurry
to
have
them
come
,
for
her
patience
was
equalled
by
her
*NL*
confidence
.
She
was
sure
that
presently
the
hoardings
,
the
quarries
,
*NL*
the
one-story
saloons
,
the
wooden
green-houses
in
ragged
gardens
,
and
*NL*
the
rocks
from
which
goats
surveyed
the
scene
,
would
vanish
before
the
*NL*
advance
of
residences
as
stately
as
her
own
--
perhaps
-LRB-
for
she
was
an
*NL*
impartial
woman
-RRB-
even
statelier
;
and
that
the
cobble-stones
over
which
*NL*
the
old
clattering
omnibuses
bumped
would
be
replaced
by
smooth
*NL*
asphalt
,
such
as
people
reported
having
seen
in
Paris
.
Meanwhile
,
as
*NL*
every
one
she
cared
to
see
came
to
HER
-LRB-
and
she
could
fill
her
rooms
as
*NL*
easily
as
the
Beauforts
,
and
without
adding
a
single
item
to
the
menu
*NL*
of
her
suppers
-RRB-
,
she
did
not
suffer
from
her
geographic
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
immense
accretion
of
flesh
which
had
descended
on
her
in
middle
*NL*
life
like
a
flood
of
lava
on
a
doomed
city
had
changed
her
from
a
plump
*NL*
active
little
woman
with
a
neatly-turned
foot
and
ankle
into
something
*NL*
as
vast
and
august
as
a
natural
phenomenon
.
She
had
accepted
this
*NL*
submergence
as
philosophically
as
all
her
other
trials
,
and
now
,
in
*NL*
extreme
old
age
,
was
rewarded
by
presenting
to
her
mirror
an
almost
*NL*
unwrinkled
expanse
of
firm
pink
and
white
flesh
,
in
the
centre
of
which
*NL*
the
traces
of
a
small
face
survived
as
if
awaiting
excavation
.
A
*NL*
flight
of
smooth
double
chins
led
down
to
the
dizzy
depths
of
a
*NL*
still-snowy
bosom
veiled
in
snowy
muslins
that
were
held
in
place
by
a
*NL*
miniature
portrait
of
the
late
Mr.
Mingott
;
and
around
and
below
,
wave
*NL*
after
wave
of
black
silk
surged
away
over
the
edges
of
a
capacious
*NL*
armchair
,
with
two
tiny
white
hands
poised
like
gulls
on
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
billows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
burden
of
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
flesh
had
long
since
made
it
*NL*
impossible
for
her
to
go
up
and
down
stairs
,
and
with
characteristic
*NL*
independence
she
had
made
her
reception
rooms
upstairs
and
established
*NL*
herself
-LRB-
in
flagrant
violation
of
all
the
New
York
proprieties
-RRB-
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
of
her
house
;
so
that
,
as
you
sat
in
her
sitting-room
*NL*
window
with
her
,
you
caught
-LRB-
through
a
door
that
was
always
open
,
and
a
*NL*
looped-back
yellow
damask
portiere
-RRB-
the
unexpected
vista
of
a
bedroom
*NL*
with
a
huge
low
bed
upholstered
like
a
sofa
,
and
a
toilet-table
with
*NL*
frivolous
lace
flounces
and
a
gilt-framed
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
visitors
were
startled
and
fascinated
by
the
foreignness
of
this
*NL*
arrangement
,
which
recalled
scenes
in
French
fiction
,
and
architectural
*NL*
incentives
to
immorality
such
as
the
simple
American
had
never
dreamed
*NL*
of
.
That
was
how
women
with
lovers
lived
in
the
wicked
old
societies
,
*NL*
in
apartments
with
all
the
rooms
on
one
floor
,
and
all
the
indecent
*NL*
propinquities
that
their
novels
described
.
It
amused
Newland
Archer
*NL*
-LRB-
who
had
secretly
situated
the
love-scenes
of
``
Monsieur
de
Camors
''
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
's
bedroom
-RRB-
to
picture
her
blameless
life
led
in
the
*NL*
stage-setting
of
adultery
;
but
he
said
to
himself
,
with
considerable
*NL*
admiration
,
that
if
a
lover
had
been
what
she
wanted
,
the
intrepid
*NL*
woman
would
have
had
him
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
general
relief
the
Countess
Olenska
was
not
present
in
her
*NL*
grandmother
's
drawing-room
during
the
visit
of
the
betrothed
couple
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
said
she
had
gone
out
;
which
,
on
a
day
of
such
glaring
*NL*
sunlight
,
and
at
the
``
shopping
hour
,
''
seemed
in
itself
an
indelicate
*NL*
thing
for
a
compromised
woman
to
do
.
But
at
any
rate
it
spared
them
*NL*
the
embarrassment
of
her
presence
,
and
the
faint
shadow
that
her
*NL*
unhappy
past
might
seem
to
shed
on
their
radiant
future
.
The
visit
*NL*
went
off
successfully
,
as
was
to
have
been
expected
.
Old
Mrs.
Mingott
*NL*
was
delighted
with
the
engagement
,
which
,
being
long
foreseen
by
*NL*
watchful
relatives
,
had
been
carefully
passed
upon
in
family
council
;
*NL*
and
the
engagement
ring
,
a
large
thick
sapphire
set
in
invisible
claws
,
*NL*
met
with
her
unqualified
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
new
setting
:
of
course
it
shows
the
stone
beautifully
,
but
it
*NL*
looks
a
little
bare
to
old-fashioned
eyes
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
had
explained
,
*NL*
with
a
conciliatory
side-glance
at
her
future
son-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old-fashioned
eyes
?
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
mine
,
my
dear
?
I
like
all
*NL*
the
novelties
,
''
said
the
ancestress
,
lifting
the
stone
to
her
small
*NL*
bright
orbs
,
which
no
glasses
had
ever
disfigured
.
``
Very
handsome
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
returning
the
jewel
;
``
very
liberal
.
In
my
time
a
cameo
set
*NL*
in
pearls
was
thought
sufficient
.
But
it
's
the
hand
that
sets
off
the
*NL*
ring
,
is
n't
it
,
my
dear
Mr.
Archer
?
''
and
she
waved
one
of
her
tiny
*NL*
hands
,
with
small
pointed
nails
and
rolls
of
aged
fat
encircling
the
*NL*
wrist
like
ivory
bracelets
.
``
Mine
was
modelled
in
Rome
by
the
great
*NL*
Ferrigiani
.
You
should
have
May
's
done
:
no
doubt
he
'll
have
it
done
,
*NL*
my
child
.
Her
hand
is
large
--
it
's
these
modern
sports
that
spread
the
*NL*
joints
--
but
the
skin
is
white
.
--
And
when
's
the
wedding
to
be
?
''
she
*NL*
broke
off
,
fixing
her
eyes
on
Archer
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
''
Mrs.
Welland
murmured
,
while
the
young
man
,
smiling
at
his
*NL*
betrothed
,
replied
:
``
As
soon
as
ever
it
can
,
if
only
you
'll
back
me
*NL*
up
,
Mrs.
Mingott
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
them
time
to
get
to
know
each
other
a
little
better
,
*NL*
mamma
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
interposed
,
with
the
proper
affectation
of
*NL*
reluctance
;
to
which
the
ancestress
rejoined
:
``
Know
each
other
?
*NL*
Fiddlesticks
!
Everybody
in
New
York
has
always
known
everybody
.
Let
*NL*
the
young
man
have
his
way
,
my
dear
;
do
n't
wait
till
the
bubble
's
off
*NL*
the
wine
.
Marry
them
before
Lent
;
I
may
catch
pneumonia
any
winter
*NL*
now
,
and
I
want
to
give
the
wedding-breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
successive
statements
were
received
with
the
proper
expressions
*NL*
of
amusement
,
incredulity
and
gratitude
;
and
the
visit
was
breaking
up
*NL*
in
a
vein
of
mild
pleasantry
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
,
who
entered
in
bonnet
and
mantle
followed
by
the
unexpected
*NL*
figure
of
Julius
Beaufort
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cousinly
murmur
of
pleasure
between
the
ladies
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Mingott
held
out
Ferrigiani
's
model
to
the
banker
.
``
Ha
!
Beaufort
,
*NL*
this
is
a
rare
favour
!
''
-LRB-
She
had
an
odd
foreign
way
of
addressing
men
*NL*
by
their
surnames

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
.
I
wish
it
might
happen
oftener
,
''
said
the
visitor
in
his
easy
*NL*
arrogant
way
.
``
I
'm
generally
so
tied
down
;
but
I
met
the
Countess
*NL*
Ellen
in
Madison
Square
,
and
she
was
good
enough
to
let
me
walk
home
*NL*
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
hope
the
house
will
be
gayer
,
now
that
Ellen
's
here
!
''
cried
Mrs.
*NL*
Mingott
with
a
glorious
effrontery
.
``
Sit
down
--
sit
down
,
Beaufort
:
*NL*
push
up
the
yellow
armchair
;
now
I
've
got
you
I
want
a
good
gossip
.
I
*NL*
hear
your
ball
was
magnificent
;
and
I
understand
you
invited
Mrs.
*NL*
Lemuel
Struthers
?
Well
--
I
've
a
curiosity
to
see
the
woman
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
forgotten
her
relatives
,
who
were
drifting
out
into
the
hall
*NL*
under
Ellen
Olenska
's
guidance
.
Old
Mrs.
Mingott
had
always
professed
*NL*
a
great
admiration
for
Julius
Beaufort
,
and
there
was
a
kind
of
kinship
*NL*
in
their
cool
domineering
way
and
their
short-cuts
through
the
*NL*
conventions
.
Now
she
was
eagerly
curious
to
know
what
had
decided
the
*NL*
Beauforts
to
invite
-LRB-
for
the
first
time
-RRB-
Mrs.
Lemuel
Struthers
,
the
*NL*
widow
of
Struthers
's
Shoe-polish
,
who
had
returned
the
previous
year
*NL*
from
a
long
initiatory
sojourn
in
Europe
to
lay
siege
to
the
tight
*NL*
little
citadel
of
New
York
.
``
Of
course
if
you
and
Regina
invite
her
*NL*
the
thing
is
settled
.
Well
,
we
need
new
blood
and
new
money
--
and
I
*NL*
hear
she
's
still
very
good-looking
,
''
the
carnivorous
old
lady
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hall
,
while
Mrs.
Welland
and
May
drew
on
their
furs
,
Archer
saw
*NL*
that
the
Countess
Olenska
was
looking
at
him
with
a
faintly
questioning
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
know
already
--
about
May
and
me
,
''
he
said
,
answering
her
*NL*
look
with
a
shy
laugh
.
``
She
scolded
me
for
not
giving
you
the
news
*NL*
last
night
at
the
Opera
:
I
had
her
orders
to
tell
you
that
we
were
*NL*
engaged
--
but
I
could
n't
,
in
that
crowd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
passed
from
Countess
Olenska
's
eyes
to
her
lips
:
she
looked
*NL*
younger
,
more
like
the
bold
brown
Ellen
Mingott
of
his
boyhood
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
I
know
;
yes
.
And
I
'm
so
glad
.
But
one
does
n't
tell
such
things
*NL*
first
in
a
crowd
.
''
The
ladies
were
on
the
threshold
and
she
held
out
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
;
come
and
see
me
some
day
,
''
she
said
,
still
looking
at
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
carriage
,
on
the
way
down
Fifth
Avenue
,
they
talked
pointedly
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
,
of
her
age
,
her
spirit
,
and
all
her
wonderful
attributes
.
*NL*
No
one
alluded
to
Ellen
Olenska
;
but
Archer
knew
that
Mrs.
Welland
was
*NL*
thinking
:
``
It
's
a
mistake
for
Ellen
to
be
seen
,
the
very
day
after
her
*NL*
arrival
,
parading
up
Fifth
Avenue
at
the
crowded
hour
with
Julius
*NL*
Beaufort
--
''
and
the
young
man
himself
mentally
added
:
``
And
she
ought
*NL*
to
know
that
a
man
who
's
just
engaged
does
n't
spend
his
time
calling
on
*NL*
married
women
.
But
I
daresay
in
the
set
she
's
lived
in
they
do
--
they
*NL*
never
do
anything
else
.
''
And
,
in
spite
of
the
cosmopolitan
views
on
*NL*
which
he
prided
himself
,
he
thanked
heaven
that
he
was
a
New
Yorker
,
*NL*
and
about
to
ally
himself
with
one
of
his
own
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
old
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
came
to
dine
with
the
*NL*
Archers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
was
a
shy
woman
and
shrank
from
society
;
but
she
liked
to
*NL*
be
well-informed
as
to
its
doings
.
Her
old
friend
Mr.
Sillerton
*NL*
Jackson
applied
to
the
investigation
of
his
friends
'
affairs
the
*NL*
patience
of
a
collector
and
the
science
of
a
naturalist
;
and
his
*NL*
sister
,
Miss
Sophy
Jackson
,
who
lived
with
him
,
and
was
entertained
by
*NL*
all
the
people
who
could
not
secure
her
much-sought-after
brother
,
*NL*
brought
home
bits
of
minor
gossip
that
filled
out
usefully
the
gaps
in
*NL*
his
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
whenever
anything
happened
that
Mrs.
Archer
wanted
to
know
*NL*
about
,
she
asked
Mr.
Jackson
to
dine
;
and
as
she
honoured
few
people
*NL*
with
her
invitations
,
and
as
she
and
her
daughter
Janey
were
an
*NL*
excellent
audience
,
Mr.
Jackson
usually
came
himself
instead
of
sending
*NL*
his
sister
.
If
he
could
have
dictated
all
the
conditions
,
he
would
*NL*
have
chosen
the
evenings
when
Newland
was
out
;
not
because
the
young
*NL*
man
was
uncongenial
to
him
-LRB-
the
two
got
on
capitally
at
their
club
-RRB-
but
*NL*
because
the
old
anecdotist
sometimes
felt
,
on
Newland
's
part
,
a
*NL*
tendency
to
weigh
his
evidence
that
the
ladies
of
the
family
never
*NL*
showed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
,
if
perfection
had
been
attainable
on
earth
,
would
also
*NL*
have
asked
that
Mrs.
Archer
's
food
should
be
a
little
better
.
But
then
*NL*
New
York
,
as
far
back
as
the
mind
of
man
could
travel
,
had
been
divided
*NL*
into
the
two
great
fundamental
groups
of
the
Mingotts
and
Mansons
and
*NL*
all
their
clan
,
who
cared
about
eating
and
clothes
and
money
,
and
the
*NL*
Archer-Newland-van-der-Luyden
tribe
,
who
were
devoted
to
travel
,
*NL*
horticulture
and
the
best
fiction
,
and
looked
down
on
the
grosser
forms
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
could
n't
have
everything
,
after
all
.
If
you
dined
with
the
Lovell
*NL*
Mingotts
you
got
canvas-back
and
terrapin
and
vintage
wines
;
at
Adeline
*NL*
Archer
's
you
could
talk
about
Alpine
scenery
and
``
The
Marble
Faun
''
;
and
*NL*
luckily
the
Archer
Madeira
had
gone
round
the
Cape
.
Therefore
when
a
*NL*
friendly
summons
came
from
Mrs.
Archer
,
Mr.
Jackson
,
who
was
a
true
*NL*
eclectic
,
would
usually
say
to
his
sister
:
``
I
've
been
a
little
gouty
*NL*
since
my
last
dinner
at
the
Lovell
Mingotts
'
--
it
will
do
me
good
to
*NL*
diet
at
Adeline
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
,
who
had
long
been
a
widow
,
lived
with
her
son
and
daughter
*NL*
in
West
Twenty-eighth
Street
.
An
upper
floor
was
dedicated
to
Newland
,
*NL*
and
the
two
women
squeezed
themselves
into
narrower
quarters
below
.
In
*NL*
an
unclouded
harmony
of
tastes
and
interests
they
cultivated
ferns
in
*NL*
Wardian
cases
,
made
macrame
lace
and
wool
embroidery
on
linen
,
*NL*
collected
American
revolutionary
glazed
ware
,
subscribed
to
``
Good
*NL*
Words
,
''
and
read
Ouida
's
novels
for
the
sake
of
the
Italian
atmosphere
.
*NL*
-LRB-
They
preferred
those
about
peasant
life
,
because
of
the
descriptions
*NL*
of
scenery
and
the
pleasanter
sentiments
,
though
in
general
they
liked
*NL*
novels
about
people
in
society
,
whose
motives
and
habits
were
more
*NL*
comprehensible
,
spoke
severely
of
Dickens
,
who
``
had
never
drawn
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
''
and
considered
Thackeray
less
at
home
in
the
great
world
*NL*
than
Bulwer
--
who
,
however
,
was
beginning
to
be
thought
old-fashioned
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Mrs.
and
Miss
Archer
were
both
great
lovers
of
scenery
.
It
was
what
*NL*
they
principally
sought
and
admired
on
their
occasional
travels
abroad
;
*NL*
considering
architecture
and
painting
as
subjects
for
men
,
and
chiefly
*NL*
for
learned
persons
who
read
Ruskin
.
Mrs.
Archer
had
been
born
a
*NL*
Newland
,
and
mother
and
daughter
,
who
were
as
like
as
sisters
,
were
*NL*
both
,
as
people
said
,
``
true
Newlands
''
;
tall
,
pale
,
and
slightly
*NL*
round-shouldered
,
with
long
noses
,
sweet
smiles
and
a
kind
of
drooping
*NL*
distinction
like
that
in
certain
faded
Reynolds
portraits
.
Their
*NL*
physical
resemblance
would
have
been
complete
if
an
elderly
embonpoint
*NL*
had
not
stretched
Mrs.
Archer
's
black
brocade
,
while
Miss
Archer
's
*NL*
brown
and
purple
poplins
hung
,
as
the
years
went
on
,
more
and
more
*NL*
slackly
on
her
virgin
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mentally
,
the
likeness
between
them
,
as
Newland
was
aware
,
was
less
*NL*
complete
than
their
identical
mannerisms
often
made
it
appear
.
The
*NL*
long
habit
of
living
together
in
mutually
dependent
intimacy
had
given
*NL*
them
the
same
vocabulary
,
and
the
same
habit
of
beginning
their
phrases
*NL*
``
Mother
thinks
''
or
``
Janey
thinks
,
''
according
as
one
or
the
other
wished
*NL*
to
advance
an
opinion
of
her
own
;
but
in
reality
,
while
Mrs.
Archer
's
*NL*
serene
unimaginativeness
rested
easily
in
the
accepted
and
familiar
,
*NL*
Janey
was
subject
to
starts
and
aberrations
of
fancy
welling
up
from
*NL*
springs
of
suppressed
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
and
daughter
adored
each
other
and
revered
their
son
and
*NL*
brother
;
and
Archer
loved
them
with
a
tenderness
made
compunctious
and
*NL*
uncritical
by
the
sense
of
their
exaggerated
admiration
,
and
by
his
*NL*
secret
satisfaction
in
it
.
After
all
,
he
thought
it
a
good
thing
for
a
*NL*
man
to
have
his
authority
respected
in
his
own
house
,
even
if
his
sense
*NL*
of
humour
sometimes
made
him
question
the
force
of
his
mandate
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
the
young
man
was
very
sure
that
Mr.
Jackson
would
*NL*
rather
have
had
him
dine
out
;
but
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
not
doing
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
old
Jackson
wanted
to
talk
about
Ellen
Olenska
,
and
of
course
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
and
Janey
wanted
to
hear
what
he
had
to
tell
.
All
three
*NL*
would
be
slightly
embarrassed
by
Newland
's
presence
,
now
that
his
*NL*
prospective
relation
to
the
Mingott
clan
had
been
made
known
;
and
the
*NL*
young
man
waited
with
an
amused
curiosity
to
see
how
they
would
turn
*NL*
the
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
,
obliquely
,
by
talking
about
Mrs.
Lemuel
Struthers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
the
Beauforts
asked
her
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
said
gently
.
``
But
*NL*
then
Regina
always
does
what
he
tells
her
;
and
BEAUFORT
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certain
nuances
escape
Beaufort
,
''
said
Mr.
Jackson
,
cautiously
*NL*
inspecting
the
broiled
shad
,
and
wondering
for
the
thousandth
time
why
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
's
cook
always
burnt
the
roe
to
a
cinder
.
-LRB-
Newland
,
who
had
*NL*
long
shared
his
wonder
,
could
always
detect
it
in
the
older
man
's
*NL*
expression
of
melancholy
disapproval
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
necessarily
;
Beaufort
is
a
vulgar
man
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
.
``
My
*NL*
grandfather
Newland
always
used
to
say
to
my
mother
:
`
Whatever
you
do
,
*NL*
do
n't
let
that
fellow
Beaufort
be
introduced
to
the
girls
.
'
But
at
*NL*
least
he
's
had
the
advantage
of
associating
with
gentlemen
;
in
England
*NL*
too
,
they
say
.
It
's
all
very
mysterious
--
''
She
glanced
at
Janey
and
*NL*
paused
.
She
and
Janey
knew
every
fold
of
the
Beaufort
mystery
,
but
in
*NL*
public
Mrs.
Archer
continued
to
assume
that
the
subject
was
not
one
for
*NL*
the
unmarried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
Mrs.
Struthers
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
continued
;
``
what
did
you
say
SHE
*NL*
was
,
Sillerton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
a
mine
:
or
rather
out
of
the
saloon
at
the
head
of
the
pit
.
*NL*
Then
with
Living
Wax-Works
,
touring
New
England
.
After
the
police
*NL*
broke
THAT
up
,
they
say
she
lived
--
''
Mr.
Jackson
in
his
turn
glanced
*NL*
at
Janey
,
whose
eyes
began
to
bulge
from
under
her
prominent
lids
.
*NL*
There
were
still
hiatuses
for
her
in
Mrs.
Struthers
's
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
Mr.
Jackson
continued
-LRB-
and
Archer
saw
he
was
wondering
why
no
*NL*
one
had
told
the
butler
never
to
slice
cucumbers
with
a
steel
knife
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
then
Lemuel
Struthers
came
along
.
They
say
his
advertiser
used
the
*NL*
girl
's
head
for
the
shoe-polish
posters
;
her
hair
's
intensely
black
,
*NL*
you
know
--
the
Egyptian
style
.
Anyhow
,
he
--
eventually
--
married
her
.
''
*NL*
There
were
volumes
of
innuendo
in
the
way
the
``
eventually
''
was
spaced
,
*NL*
and
each
syllable
given
its
due
stress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
at
the
pass
we
've
come
to
nowadays
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
indifferently
.
The
ladies
were
not
really
interested
in
*NL*
Mrs.
Struthers
just
then
;
the
subject
of
Ellen
Olenska
was
too
fresh
*NL*
and
too
absorbing
to
them
.
Indeed
,
Mrs.
Struthers
's
name
had
been
*NL*
introduced
by
Mrs.
Archer
only
that
she
might
presently
be
able
to
say
:
*NL*
``
And
Newland
's
new
cousin
--
Countess
Olenska
?
Was
SHE
at
the
ball
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
faint
touch
of
sarcasm
in
the
reference
to
her
son
,
and
*NL*
Archer
knew
it
and
had
expected
it
.
Even
Mrs.
Archer
,
who
was
seldom
*NL*
unduly
pleased
with
human
events
,
had
been
altogether
glad
of
her
son
's
*NL*
engagement
.
-LRB-
``
Especially
after
that
silly
business
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
,
''
as
she
had
remarked
to
Janey
,
alluding
to
what
had
once
*NL*
seemed
to
Newland
a
tragedy
of
which
his
soul
would
always
bear
the
*NL*
scar
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
better
match
in
New
York
than
May
Welland
,
look
at
the
*NL*
question
from
whatever
point
you
chose
.
Of
course
such
a
marriage
was
*NL*
only
what
Newland
was
entitled
to
;
but
young
men
are
so
foolish
and
*NL*
incalculable
--
and
some
women
so
ensnaring
and
unscrupulous
--
that
it
was
*NL*
nothing
short
of
a
miracle
to
see
one
's
only
son
safe
past
the
Siren
*NL*
Isle
and
in
the
haven
of
a
blameless
domesticity
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
Mrs.
Archer
felt
,
and
her
son
knew
she
felt
;
but
he
knew
also
*NL*
that
she
had
been
perturbed
by
the
premature
announcement
of
his
*NL*
engagement
,
or
rather
by
its
cause
;
and
it
was
for
that
reason
--
because
*NL*
on
the
whole
he
was
a
tender
and
indulgent
master
--
that
he
had
stayed
*NL*
at
home
that
evening
.
``
It
's
not
that
I
do
n't
approve
of
the
Mingotts
'
*NL*
esprit
de
corps
;
but
why
Newland
's
engagement
should
be
mixed
up
with
*NL*
that
Olenska
woman
's
comings
and
goings
I
do
n't
see
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
*NL*
grumbled
to
Janey
,
the
only
witness
of
her
slight
lapses
from
perfect
*NL*
sweetness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
behaved
beautifully
--
and
in
beautiful
behaviour
she
was
*NL*
unsurpassed
--
during
the
call
on
Mrs.
Welland
;
but
Newland
knew
-LRB-
and
his
*NL*
betrothed
doubtless
guessed
-RRB-
that
all
through
the
visit
she
and
Janey
*NL*
were
nervously
on
the
watch
for
Madame
Olenska
's
possible
intrusion
;
*NL*
and
when
they
left
the
house
together
she
had
permitted
herself
to
say
*NL*
to
her
son
:
``
I
'm
thankful
that
Augusta
Welland
received
us
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
indications
of
inward
disturbance
moved
Archer
the
more
that
he
*NL*
too
felt
that
the
Mingotts
had
gone
a
little
too
far
.
But
,
as
it
was
*NL*
against
all
the
rules
of
their
code
that
the
mother
and
son
should
ever
*NL*
allude
to
what
was
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
,
he
simply
replied
:
``
Oh
,
*NL*
well
,
there
's
always
a
phase
of
family
parties
to
be
gone
through
when
*NL*
one
gets
engaged
,
and
the
sooner
it
's
over
the
better
.
''
At
which
his
*NL*
mother
merely
pursed
her
lips
under
the
lace
veil
that
hung
down
from
*NL*
her
grey
velvet
bonnet
trimmed
with
frosted
grapes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
revenge
,
he
felt
--
her
lawful
revenge
--
would
be
to
``
draw
''
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
that
evening
on
the
Countess
Olenska
;
and
,
having
publicly
done
*NL*
his
duty
as
a
future
member
of
the
Mingott
clan
,
the
young
man
had
no
*NL*
objection
to
hearing
the
lady
discussed
in
private
--
except
that
the
*NL*
subject
was
already
beginning
to
bore
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
had
helped
himself
to
a
slice
of
the
tepid
filet
which
the
*NL*
mournful
butler
had
handed
him
with
a
look
as
sceptical
as
his
own
,
and
*NL*
had
rejected
the
mushroom
sauce
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
sniff
.
He
*NL*
looked
baffled
and
hungry
,
and
Archer
reflected
that
he
would
probably
*NL*
finish
his
meal
on
Ellen
Olenska
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
candlelit
*NL*
Archers
,
Newlands
and
van
der
Luydens
hanging
in
dark
frames
on
the
*NL*
dark
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
your
grandfather
Archer
loved
a
good
dinner
,
my
dear
Newland
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
his
eyes
on
the
portrait
of
a
plump
full-chested
young
man
in
*NL*
a
stock
and
a
blue
coat
,
with
a
view
of
a
white-columned
country-house
*NL*
behind
him
.
``
Well
--
well
--
well
...
I
wonder
what
he
would
have
said
to
*NL*
all
these
foreign
marriages
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
ignored
the
allusion
to
the
ancestral
cuisine
and
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
continued
with
deliberation
:
``
No
,
she
was
NOT
at
the
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
''
Mrs.
Archer
murmured
,
in
a
tone
that
implied
:
``
She
had
that
*NL*
decency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
the
Beauforts
do
n't
know
her
,
''
Janey
suggested
,
with
her
*NL*
artless
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
gave
a
faint
sip
,
as
if
he
had
been
tasting
invisible
*NL*
Madeira
.
``
Mrs.
Beaufort
may
not
--
but
Beaufort
certainly
does
,
for
she
*NL*
was
seen
walking
up
Fifth
Avenue
this
afternoon
with
him
by
the
whole
*NL*
of
New
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
--
''
moaned
Mrs.
Archer
,
evidently
perceiving
the
uselessness
of
*NL*
trying
to
ascribe
the
actions
of
foreigners
to
a
sense
of
delicacy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
she
wears
a
round
hat
or
a
bonnet
in
the
afternoon
,
''
Janey
*NL*
speculated
.
``
At
the
Opera
I
know
she
had
on
dark
blue
velvet
,
*NL*
perfectly
plain
and
flat
--
like
a
night-gown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Janey
!
''
said
her
mother
;
and
Miss
Archer
blushed
and
tried
to
look
*NL*
audacious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
at
any
rate
,
in
better
taste
not
to
go
to
the
ball
,
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
spirit
of
perversity
moved
her
son
to
rejoin
:
``
I
do
n't
think
it
was
*NL*
a
question
of
taste
with
her
.
May
said
she
meant
to
go
,
and
then
*NL*
decided
that
the
dress
in
question
was
n't
smart
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
smiled
at
this
confirmation
of
her
inference
.
``
Poor
*NL*
Ellen
,
''
she
simply
remarked
;
adding
compassionately
:
``
We
must
always
*NL*
bear
in
mind
what
an
eccentric
bringing-up
Medora
Manson
gave
her
.
*NL*
What
can
you
expect
of
a
girl
who
was
allowed
to
wear
black
satin
at
*NL*
her
coming-out
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
do
n't
I
remember
her
in
it
!
''
said
Mr.
Jackson
;
adding
:
``
Poor
*NL*
girl
!
''
in
the
tone
of
one
who
,
while
enjoying
the
memory
,
had
fully
*NL*
understood
at
the
time
what
the
sight
portended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
odd
,
''
Janey
remarked
,
``
that
she
should
have
kept
such
an
ugly
*NL*
name
as
Ellen
.
I
should
have
changed
it
to
Elaine
.
''
She
glanced
about
*NL*
the
table
to
see
the
effect
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
laughed
.
``
Why
Elaine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
it
sounds
more
--
more
Polish
,
''
said
Janey
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
more
conspicuous
;
and
that
can
hardly
be
what
she
wishes
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Archer
distantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
broke
in
her
son
,
growing
suddenly
argumentative
.
``
Why
*NL*
should
n't
she
be
conspicuous
if
she
chooses
?
Why
should
she
slink
*NL*
about
as
if
it
were
she
who
had
disgraced
herself
?
She
's
`
poor
Ellen
'
*NL*
certainly
,
because
she
had
the
bad
luck
to
make
a
wretched
marriage
;
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
see
that
that
's
a
reason
for
hiding
her
head
as
if
she
were
*NL*
the
culprit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Mr.
Jackson
,
speculatively
,
``
is
the
line
the
*NL*
Mingotts
mean
to
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
reddened
.
``
I
did
n't
have
to
wait
for
their
cue
,
if
*NL*
that
's
what
you
mean
,
sir

Madame
Olenska
has
had
an
unhappy
life
:
*NL*
that
does
n't
make
her
an
outcast

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
rumours

began
Mr.
Jackson
,
glancing
at
Janey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
:
the
secretary
,

the
young
man
took
him
up
.
``
Nonsense

*NL*
mother
;
Janey
's
grown-up

They
say

do
n't
they

he
went
on
,
``
that
the
*NL*
secretary
helped
her
to
get
away
from
her
brute
of
a
husband
,
who
kept

her
practically
a
prisoner
?
Well
,
what
if
he
did
?
I
hope
there
is
n't
*NL*
a
man
among
us
who
would
n't
have
done
the
same
in
such
a
case

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
say
to
the
sad
butler
:
*NL*
``
Perhaps
...
that
sauce
...
just
a
little
,
after
all
--
''
;
then
,
having
*NL*
helped
himself
,
he
remarked
:
``
I
'm
told
she
's
looking
for
a
house
.
She
*NL*
means
to
live
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
she
means
to
get
a
divorce
,
''
said
Janey
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
will
!
''
Archer
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
had
fallen
like
a
bombshell
in
the
pure
and
tranquil
*NL*
atmosphere
of
the
Archer
dining-room
.
Mrs.
Archer
raised
her
delicate
*NL*
eye-brows
in
the
particular
curve
that
signified
:
``
The
butler
--
''
and
*NL*
the
young
man
,
himself
mindful
of
the
bad
taste
of
discussing
such
*NL*
intimate
matters
in
public
,
hastily
branched
off
into
an
account
of
his
*NL*
visit
to
old
Mrs.
Mingott
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
according
to
immemorial
custom
,
Mrs.
Archer
and
Janey
*NL*
trailed
their
long
silk
draperies
up
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
,
while
*NL*
the
gentlemen
smoked
below
stairs
,
they
sat
beside
a
Carcel
lamp
with
*NL*
an
engraved
globe
,
facing
each
other
across
a
rosewood
work-table
with
*NL*
a
green
silk
bag
under
it
,
and
stitched
at
the
two
ends
of
a
tapestry
*NL*
band
of
field-flowers
destined
to
adorn
an
``
occasional
''
chair
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
of
young
Mrs.
Newland
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
rite
was
in
progress
in
the
drawing-room
,
Archer
settled
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
in
an
armchair
near
the
fire
in
the
Gothic
library
and
handed
*NL*
him
a
cigar
.
Mr.
Jackson
sank
into
the
armchair
with
satisfaction
,
lit
*NL*
his
cigar
with
perfect
confidence
-LRB-
it
was
Newland
who
bought
them
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
stretching
his
thin
old
ankles
to
the
coals
,
said
:
``
You
say
the
*NL*
secretary
merely
helped
her
to
get
away
,
my
dear
fellow
?
Well
,
he
was
*NL*
still
helping
her
a
year
later
,
then
;
for
somebody
met
'em
living
at
*NL*
Lausanne
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
reddened
.
``
Living
together
?
Well
,
why
not
?
Who
had
the
right
*NL*
to
make
her
life
over
if
she
had
n't
?
I
'm
sick
of
the
hypocrisy
that
*NL*
would
bury
alive
a
woman
of
her
age
if
her
husband
prefers
to
live
with
*NL*
harlots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
and
turned
away
angrily
to
light
his
cigar
.
``
Women
ought
to
*NL*
be
free
--
as
free
as
we
are
,
''
he
declared
,
making
a
discovery
of
which
*NL*
he
was
too
irritated
to
measure
the
terrific
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
stretched
his
ankles
nearer
the
coals
and
emitted
*NL*
a
sardonic
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
after
a
pause
,
``
apparently
Count
Olenski
takes
your
*NL*
view
;
for
I
never
heard
of
his
having
lifted
a
finger
to
get
his
wife
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
after
Mr.
Jackson
had
taken
himself
away
,
and
the
ladies
*NL*
had
retired
to
their
chintz-curtained
bedroom
,
Newland
Archer
mounted
*NL*
thoughtfully
to
his
own
study
.
A
vigilant
hand
had
,
as
usual
,
kept
the
*NL*
fire
alive
and
the
lamp
trimmed
;
and
the
room
,
with
its
rows
and
rows
*NL*
of
books
,
its
bronze
and
steel
statuettes
of
``
The
Fencers
''
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
and
its
many
photographs
of
famous
pictures
,
looked
*NL*
singularly
home-like
and
welcoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
dropped
into
his
armchair
near
the
fire
his
eyes
rested
on
a
*NL*
large
photograph
of
May
Welland
,
which
the
young
girl
had
given
him
in
*NL*
the
first
days
of
their
romance
,
and
which
had
now
displaced
all
the
*NL*
other
portraits
on
the
table
.
With
a
new
sense
of
awe
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
frank
forehead
,
serious
eyes
and
gay
innocent
mouth
of
the
young
*NL*
creature
whose
soul
's
custodian
he
was
to
be
.
That
terrifying
product
*NL*
of
the
social
system
he
belonged
to
and
believed
in
,
the
young
girl
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
and
expected
everything
,
looked
back
at
him
like
a
*NL*
stranger
through
May
Welland
's
familiar
features
;
and
once
more
it
was
*NL*
borne
in
on
him
that
marriage
was
not
the
safe
anchorage
he
had
been
*NL*
taught
to
think
,
but
a
voyage
on
uncharted
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
of
the
Countess
Olenska
had
stirred
up
old
settled
convictions
*NL*
and
set
them
drifting
dangerously
through
his
mind
.
His
own
*NL*
exclamation
:
``
Women
should
be
free
--
as
free
as
we
are
,
''
struck
to
the
*NL*
root
of
a
problem
that
it
was
agreed
in
his
world
to
regard
as
*NL*
non-existent
.
``
Nice
''
women
,
however
wronged
,
would
never
claim
the
*NL*
kind
of
freedom
he
meant
,
and
generous-minded
men
like
himself
were
*NL*
therefore
--
in
the
heat
of
argument
--
the
more
chivalrously
ready
to
*NL*
concede
it
to
them
.
Such
verbal
generosities
were
in
fact
only
a
*NL*
humbugging
disguise
of
the
inexorable
conventions
that
tied
things
*NL*
together
and
bound
people
down
to
the
old
pattern
.
But
here
he
was
*NL*
pledged
to
defend
,
on
the
part
of
his
betrothed
's
cousin
,
conduct
that
,
*NL*
on
his
own
wife
's
part
,
would
justify
him
in
calling
down
on
her
all
*NL*
the
thunders
of
Church
and
State
.
Of
course
the
dilemma
was
purely
*NL*
hypothetical
;
since
he
was
n't
a
blackguard
Polish
nobleman
,
it
was
*NL*
absurd
to
speculate
what
his
wife
's
rights
would
be
if
he
WERE
.
But
*NL*
Newland
Archer
was
too
imaginative
not
to
feel
that
,
in
his
case
and
*NL*
May
's
,
the
tie
might
gall
for
reasons
far
less
gross
and
palpable
.
*NL*
What
could
he
and
she
really
know
of
each
other
,
since
it
was
his
duty
,
*NL*
as
a
``
decent
''
fellow
,
to
conceal
his
past
from
her
,
and
hers
,
as
a
*NL*
marriageable
girl
,
to
have
no
past
to
conceal
?
What
if
,
for
some
one
*NL*
of
the
subtler
reasons
that
would
tell
with
both
of
them
,
they
should
*NL*
tire
of
each
other
,
misunderstand
or
irritate
each
other
?
He
reviewed
*NL*
his
friends
'
marriages
--
the
supposedly
happy
ones
--
and
saw
none
that
*NL*
answered
,
even
remotely
,
to
the
passionate
and
tender
comradeship
which
*NL*
he
pictured
as
his
permanent
relation
with
May
Welland
.
He
perceived
*NL*
that
such
a
picture
presupposed
,
on
her
part
,
the
experience
,
the
*NL*
versatility
,
the
freedom
of
judgment
,
which
she
had
been
carefully
*NL*
trained
not
to
possess
;
and
with
a
shiver
of
foreboding
he
saw
his
*NL*
marriage
becoming
what
most
of
the
other
marriages
about
him
were
:
a
*NL*
dull
association
of
material
and
social
interests
held
together
by
*NL*
ignorance
on
the
one
side
and
hypocrisy
on
the
other
.
Lawrence
*NL*
Lefferts
occurred
to
him
as
the
husband
who
had
most
completely
*NL*
realised
this
enviable
ideal
.
As
became
the
high-priest
of
form
,
he
*NL*
had
formed
a
wife
so
completely
to
his
own
convenience
that
,
in
the
*NL*
most
conspicuous
moments
of
his
frequent
love-affairs
with
other
men
's
*NL*
wives
,
she
went
about
in
smiling
unconsciousness
,
saying
that
``
Lawrence
*NL*
was
so
frightfully
strict
''
;
and
had
been
known
to
blush
indignantly
,
*NL*
and
avert
her
gaze
,
when
some
one
alluded
in
her
presence
to
the
fact
*NL*
that
Julius
Beaufort
-LRB-
as
became
a
``
foreigner
''
of
doubtful
origin
-RRB-
had
*NL*
what
was
known
in
New
York
as
``
another
establishment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
not
quite
*NL*
such
an
ass
as
Larry
Lefferts
,
nor
May
such
a
simpleton
as
poor
*NL*
Gertrude
;
but
the
difference
was
after
all
one
of
intelligence
and
not
*NL*
of
standards
.
In
reality
they
all
lived
in
a
kind
of
hieroglyphic
*NL*
world
,
where
the
real
thing
was
never
said
or
done
or
even
thought
,
but
*NL*
only
represented
by
a
set
of
arbitrary
signs
;
as
when
Mrs.
Welland
,
who
*NL*
knew
exactly
why
Archer
had
pressed
her
to
announce
her
daughter
's
*NL*
engagement
at
the
Beaufort
ball
-LRB-
and
had
indeed
expected
him
to
do
no
*NL*
less
-RRB-
,
yet
felt
obliged
to
simulate
reluctance
,
and
the
air
of
having
*NL*
had
her
hand
forced
,
quite
as
,
in
the
books
on
Primitive
Man
that
*NL*
people
of
advanced
culture
were
beginning
to
read
,
the
savage
bride
is
*NL*
dragged
with
shrieks
from
her
parents
'
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
,
of
course
,
was
that
the
young
girl
who
was
the
centre
of
*NL*
this
elaborate
system
of
mystification
remained
the
more
inscrutable
*NL*
for
her
very
frankness
and
assurance
.
She
was
frank
,
poor
darling
,
*NL*
because
she
had
nothing
to
conceal
,
assured
because
she
knew
of
nothing
*NL*
to
be
on
her
guard
against
;
and
with
no
better
preparation
than
this
,
*NL*
she
was
to
be
plunged
overnight
into
what
people
evasively
called
``
the
*NL*
facts
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
sincerely
but
placidly
in
love
.
He
delighted
in
the
*NL*
radiant
good
looks
of
his
betrothed
,
in
her
health
,
her
horsemanship
,
*NL*
her
grace
and
quickness
at
games
,
and
the
shy
interest
in
books
and
*NL*
ideas
that
she
was
beginning
to
develop
under
his
guidance
.
-LRB-
She
had
*NL*
advanced
far
enough
to
join
him
in
ridiculing
the
Idyls
of
the
King
,
*NL*
but
not
to
feel
the
beauty
of
Ulysses
and
the
Lotus
Eaters
.
-RRB-
She
was
*NL*
straightforward
,
loyal
and
brave
;
she
had
a
sense
of
humour
-LRB-
chiefly
*NL*
proved
by
her
laughing
at
HIS
jokes
-RRB-
;
and
he
suspected
,
in
the
depths
*NL*
of
her
innocently-gazing
soul
,
a
glow
of
feeling
that
it
would
be
a
joy
*NL*
to
waken
.
But
when
he
had
gone
the
brief
round
of
her
he
returned
*NL*
discouraged
by
the
thought
that
all
this
frankness
and
innocence
were
*NL*
only
an
artificial
product
.
Untrained
human
nature
was
not
frank
and
*NL*
innocent
;
it
was
full
of
the
twists
and
defences
of
an
instinctive
*NL*
guile
.
And
he
felt
himself
oppressed
by
this
creation
of
factitious
*NL*
purity
,
so
cunningly
manufactured
by
a
conspiracy
of
mothers
and
aunts
*NL*
and
grandmothers
and
long-dead
ancestresses
,
because
it
was
supposed
to
*NL*
be
what
he
wanted
,
what
he
had
a
right
to
,
in
order
that
he
might
*NL*
exercise
his
lordly
pleasure
in
smashing
it
like
an
image
made
of
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
certain
triteness
in
these
reflections
:
they
were
those
*NL*
habitual
to
young
men
on
the
approach
of
their
wedding
day
.
But
they
*NL*
were
generally
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
compunction
and
self-abasement
*NL*
of
which
Newland
Archer
felt
no
trace
.
He
could
not
deplore
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Thackeray
's
heroes
so
often
exasperated
him
by
doing
-RRB-
that
he
had
not
a
*NL*
blank
page
to
offer
his
bride
in
exchange
for
the
unblemished
one
she
*NL*
was
to
give
to
him
.
He
could
not
get
away
from
the
fact
that
if
he
had
*NL*
been
brought
up
as
she
had
they
would
have
been
no
more
fit
to
find
*NL*
their
way
about
than
the
Babes
in
the
Wood
;
nor
could
he
,
for
all
his
*NL*
anxious
cogitations
,
see
any
honest
reason
-LRB-
any
,
that
is
,
unconnected
*NL*
with
his
own
momentary
pleasure
,
and
the
passion
of
masculine
vanity
-RRB-
*NL*
why
his
bride
should
not
have
been
allowed
the
same
freedom
of
*NL*
experience
as
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
questions
,
at
such
an
hour
,
were
bound
to
drift
through
his
mind
;
*NL*
but
he
was
conscious
that
their
uncomfortable
persistence
and
precision
*NL*
were
due
to
the
inopportune
arrival
of
the
Countess
Olenska
.
Here
he
*NL*
was
,
at
the
very
moment
of
his
betrothal
--
a
moment
for
pure
thoughts
*NL*
and
cloudless
hopes
--
pitchforked
into
a
coil
of
scandal
which
raised
*NL*
all
the
special
problems
he
would
have
preferred
to
let
lie
.
``
Hang
*NL*
Ellen
Olenska
!
''
he
grumbled
,
as
he
covered
his
fire
and
began
to
*NL*
undress
.
He
could
not
really
see
why
her
fate
should
have
the
least
*NL*
bearing
on
his
;
yet
he
dimly
felt
that
he
had
only
just
begun
to
*NL*
measure
the
risks
of
the
championship
which
his
engagement
had
forced
*NL*
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
the
bolt
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lovell
Mingotts
had
sent
out
cards
for
what
was
known
as
``
a
formal
*NL*
dinner
''
-LRB-
that
is
,
three
extra
footmen
,
two
dishes
for
each
course
,
and
*NL*
a
Roman
punch
in
the
middle
-RRB-
,
and
had
headed
their
invitations
with
the
*NL*
words
``
To
meet
the
Countess
Olenska
,
''
in
accordance
with
the
hospitable
*NL*
American
fashion
,
which
treats
strangers
as
if
they
were
royalties
,
or
*NL*
at
least
as
their
ambassadors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
had
been
selected
with
a
boldness
and
discrimination
in
*NL*
which
the
initiated
recognised
the
firm
hand
of
Catherine
the
Great
.
*NL*
Associated
with
such
immemorial
standbys
as
the
Selfridge
Merrys
,
who
*NL*
were
asked
everywhere
because
they
always
had
been
,
the
Beauforts
,
on
*NL*
whom
there
was
a
claim
of
relationship
,
and
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
and
*NL*
his
sister
Sophy
-LRB-
who
went
wherever
her
brother
told
her
to
-RRB-
,
were
some
*NL*
of
the
most
fashionable
and
yet
most
irreproachable
of
the
dominant
*NL*
``
young
married
''
set
;
the
Lawrence
Leffertses
,
Mrs.
Lefferts
Rushworth
*NL*
-LRB-
the
lovely
widow
-RRB-
,
the
Harry
Thorleys
,
the
Reggie
Chiverses
and
young
*NL*
Morris
Dagonet
and
his
wife
-LRB-
who
was
a
van
der
Luyden
-RRB-
.
The
company
*NL*
indeed
was
perfectly
assorted
,
since
all
the
members
belonged
to
the
*NL*
little
inner
group
of
people
who
,
during
the
long
New
York
season
,
*NL*
disported
themselves
together
daily
and
nightly
with
apparently
*NL*
undiminished
zest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forty-eight
hours
later
the
unbelievable
had
happened
;
every
one
had
*NL*
refused
the
Mingotts
'
invitation
except
the
Beauforts
and
old
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
and
his
sister
.
The
intended
slight
was
emphasised
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
even
the
Reggie
Chiverses
,
who
were
of
the
Mingott
clan
,
were
*NL*
among
those
inflicting
it
;
and
by
the
uniform
wording
of
the
notes
,
in
*NL*
all
of
which
the
writers
``
regretted
that
they
were
unable
to
accept
,
''
*NL*
without
the
mitigating
plea
of
a
``
previous
engagement
''
that
ordinary
*NL*
courtesy
prescribed
.
*NL*
*NL*
New
York
society
was
,
in
those
days
,
far
too
small
,
and
too
scant
in
*NL*
its
resources
,
for
every
one
in
it
-LRB-
including
livery-stable-keepers
,
*NL*
butlers
and
cooks
-RRB-
not
to
know
exactly
on
which
evenings
people
were
*NL*
free
;
and
it
was
thus
possible
for
the
recipients
of
Mrs.
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
's
invitations
to
make
cruelly
clear
their
determination
not
to
*NL*
meet
the
Countess
Olenska
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blow
was
unexpected
;
but
the
Mingotts
,
as
their
way
was
,
met
it
*NL*
gallantly
.
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
confided
the
case
to
Mrs.
Welland
,
who
*NL*
confided
it
to
Newland
Archer
;
who
,
aflame
at
the
outrage
,
appealed
*NL*
passionately
and
authoritatively
to
his
mother
;
who
,
after
a
painful
*NL*
period
of
inward
resistance
and
outward
temporising
,
succumbed
to
his
*NL*
instances
-LRB-
as
she
always
did
-RRB-
,
and
immediately
embracing
his
cause
with
*NL*
an
energy
redoubled
by
her
previous
hesitations
,
put
on
her
grey
velvet
*NL*
bonnet
and
said
:
``
I
'll
go
and
see
Louisa
van
der
Luyden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
New
York
of
Newland
Archer
's
day
was
a
small
and
slippery
pyramid
,
*NL*
in
which
,
as
yet
,
hardly
a
fissure
had
been
made
or
a
foothold
gained
.
*NL*
At
its
base
was
a
firm
foundation
of
what
Mrs.
Archer
called
``
plain
*NL*
people
''
;
an
honourable
but
obscure
majority
of
respectable
families
who
*NL*
-LRB-
as
in
the
case
of
the
Spicers
or
the
Leffertses
or
the
Jacksons
-RRB-
had
*NL*
been
raised
above
their
level
by
marriage
with
one
of
the
ruling
clans
.
*NL*
People
,
Mrs.
Archer
always
said
,
were
not
as
particular
as
they
used
to
*NL*
be
;
and
with
old
Catherine
Spicer
ruling
one
end
of
Fifth
Avenue
,
and
*NL*
Julius
Beaufort
the
other
,
you
could
n't
expect
the
old
traditions
to
*NL*
last
much
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Firmly
narrowing
upward
from
this
wealthy
but
inconspicuous
substratum
*NL*
was
the
compact
and
dominant
group
which
the
Mingotts
,
Newlands
,
*NL*
Chiverses
and
Mansons
so
actively
represented
.
Most
people
imagined
*NL*
them
to
be
the
very
apex
of
the
pyramid
;
but
they
themselves
-LRB-
at
least
*NL*
those
of
Mrs.
Archer
's
generation
-RRB-
were
aware
that
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
professional
genealogist
,
only
a
still
smaller
number
of
families
could
*NL*
lay
claim
to
that
eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
tell
me
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
would
say
to
her
children
,
``
all
this
*NL*
modern
newspaper
rubbish
about
a
New
York
aristocracy
.
If
there
is
*NL*
one
,
neither
the
Mingotts
nor
the
Mansons
belong
to
it
;
no
,
nor
the
*NL*
Newlands
or
the
Chiverses
either
.
Our
grandfathers
and
*NL*
great-grandfathers
were
just
respectable
English
or
Dutch
merchants
,
*NL*
who
came
to
the
colonies
to
make
their
fortune
,
and
stayed
here
because
*NL*
they
did
so
well
.
One
of
your
great-grandfathers
signed
the
*NL*
Declaration
,
and
another
was
a
general
on
Washington
's
staff
,
and
*NL*
received
General
Burgoyne
's
sword
after
the
battle
of
Saratoga
.
These
*NL*
are
things
to
be
proud
of
,
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
rank
or
*NL*
class
.
New
York
has
always
been
a
commercial
community
,
and
there
are
*NL*
not
more
than
three
families
in
it
who
can
claim
an
aristocratic
origin
*NL*
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
and
her
son
and
daughter
,
like
every
one
else
in
New
York
,
*NL*
knew
who
these
privileged
beings
were
:
the
Dagonets
of
Washington
*NL*
Square
,
who
came
of
an
old
English
county
family
allied
with
the
Pitts
*NL*
and
Foxes
;
the
Lannings
,
who
had
intermarried
with
the
descendants
of
*NL*
Count
de
Grasse
,
and
the
van
der
Luydens
,
direct
descendants
of
the
*NL*
first
Dutch
governor
of
Manhattan
,
and
related
by
pre-revolutionary
*NL*
marriages
to
several
members
of
the
French
and
British
aristocracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lannings
survived
only
in
the
person
of
two
very
old
but
lively
*NL*
Miss
Lannings
,
who
lived
cheerfully
and
reminiscently
among
family
*NL*
portraits
and
Chippendale
;
the
Dagonets
were
a
considerable
clan
,
*NL*
allied
to
the
best
names
in
Baltimore
and
Philadelphia
;
but
the
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
,
who
stood
above
all
of
them
,
had
faded
into
a
kind
of
*NL*
super-terrestrial
twilight
,
from
which
only
two
figures
impressively
*NL*
emerged
;
those
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Henry
van
der
Luyden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Henry
van
der
Luyden
had
been
Louisa
Dagonet
,
and
her
mother
had
*NL*
been
the
granddaughter
of
Colonel
du
Lac
,
of
an
old
Channel
Island
*NL*
family
,
who
had
fought
under
Cornwallis
and
had
settled
in
Maryland
,
*NL*
after
the
war
,
with
his
bride
,
Lady
Angelica
Trevenna
,
fifth
daughter
*NL*
of
the
Earl
of
St.
Austrey
.
The
tie
between
the
Dagonets
,
the
du
Lacs
*NL*
of
Maryland
,
and
their
aristocratic
Cornish
kinsfolk
,
the
Trevennas
,
*NL*
had
always
remained
close
and
cordial
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
had
*NL*
more
than
once
paid
long
visits
to
the
present
head
of
the
house
of
*NL*
Trevenna
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
,
at
his
country-seat
in
Cornwall
and
*NL*
at
St.
Austrey
in
Gloucestershire
;
and
his
Grace
had
frequently
*NL*
announced
his
intention
of
some
day
returning
their
visit
-LRB-
without
the
*NL*
Duchess
,
who
feared
the
Atlantic
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
divided
their
time
between
Trevenna
,
their
*NL*
place
in
Maryland
,
and
Skuytercliff
,
the
great
estate
on
the
Hudson
*NL*
which
had
been
one
of
the
colonial
grants
of
the
Dutch
government
to
*NL*
the
famous
first
Governor
,
and
of
which
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
was
still
*NL*
``
Patroon
.
''
Their
large
solemn
house
in
Madison
Avenue
was
seldom
*NL*
opened
,
and
when
they
came
to
town
they
received
in
it
only
their
most
*NL*
intimate
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
go
with
me
,
Newland
,
''
his
mother
said
,
suddenly
*NL*
pausing
at
the
door
of
the
Brown
coupe
.
``
Louisa
is
fond
of
you
;
and
of
*NL*
course
it
's
on
account
of
dear
May
that
I
'm
taking
this
step
--
and
also
*NL*
because
,
if
we
do
n't
all
stand
together
,
there
'll
be
no
such
thing
as
*NL*
Society
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Henry
van
der
Luyden
listened
in
silence
to
her
cousin
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
's
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
very
well
to
tell
yourself
in
advance
that
Mrs.
van
der
*NL*
Luyden
was
always
silent
,
and
that
,
though
non-committal
by
nature
and
*NL*
training
,
she
was
very
kind
to
the
people
she
really
liked
.
Even
*NL*
personal
experience
of
these
facts
was
not
always
a
protection
from
the
*NL*
chill
that
descended
on
one
in
the
high-ceilinged
white-walled
Madison
*NL*
Avenue
drawing-room
,
with
the
pale
brocaded
armchairs
so
obviously
*NL*
uncovered
for
the
occasion
,
and
the
gauze
still
veiling
the
ormolu
*NL*
mantel
ornaments
and
the
beautiful
old
carved
frame
of
Gainsborough
's
*NL*
``
Lady
Angelica
du
Lac
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
portrait
by
Huntington
-LRB-
in
black
velvet
and
*NL*
Venetian
point
-RRB-
faced
that
of
her
lovely
ancestress
.
It
was
generally
*NL*
considered
``
as
fine
as
a
Cabanel
,
''
and
,
though
twenty
years
had
elapsed
*NL*
since
its
execution
,
was
still
``
a
perfect
likeness
.
''
Indeed
the
Mrs.
*NL*
van
der
Luyden
who
sat
beneath
it
listening
to
Mrs.
Archer
might
have
*NL*
been
the
twin-sister
of
the
fair
and
still
youngish
woman
drooping
*NL*
against
a
gilt
armchair
before
a
green
rep
curtain
.
Mrs.
van
der
*NL*
Luyden
still
wore
black
velvet
and
Venetian
point
when
she
went
into
*NL*
society
--
or
rather
-LRB-
since
she
never
dined
out
-RRB-
when
she
threw
open
her
*NL*
own
doors
to
receive
it
.
Her
fair
hair
,
which
had
faded
without
*NL*
turning
grey
,
was
still
parted
in
flat
overlapping
points
on
her
*NL*
forehead
,
and
the
straight
nose
that
divided
her
pale
blue
eyes
was
*NL*
only
a
little
more
pinched
about
the
nostrils
than
when
the
portrait
*NL*
had
been
painted
.
She
always
,
indeed
,
struck
Newland
Archer
as
having
*NL*
been
rather
gruesomely
preserved
in
the
airless
atmosphere
of
a
*NL*
perfectly
irreproachable
existence
,
as
bodies
caught
in
glaciers
keep
*NL*
for
years
a
rosy
life-in-death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
his
family
,
he
esteemed
and
admired
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
;
but
*NL*
he
found
her
gentle
bending
sweetness
less
approachable
than
the
*NL*
grimness
of
some
of
his
mother
's
old
aunts
,
fierce
spinsters
who
said
*NL*
``
No
''
on
principle
before
they
knew
what
they
were
going
to
be
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
attitude
said
neither
yes
nor
no
,
but
always
*NL*
appeared
to
incline
to
clemency
till
her
thin
lips
,
wavering
into
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
smile
,
made
the
almost
invariable
reply
:
``
I
shall
first
*NL*
have
to
talk
this
over
with
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
were
so
exactly
alike
that
Archer
often
*NL*
wondered
how
,
after
forty
years
of
the
closest
conjugality
,
two
such
*NL*
merged
identities
ever
separated
themselves
enough
for
anything
as
*NL*
controversial
as
a
talking-over
.
But
as
neither
had
ever
reached
a
*NL*
decision
without
prefacing
it
by
this
mysterious
conclave
,
Mrs.
Archer
*NL*
and
her
son
,
having
set
forth
their
case
,
waited
resignedly
for
the
*NL*
familiar
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
,
however
,
who
had
seldom
surprised
any
one
,
now
*NL*
surprised
them
by
reaching
her
long
hand
toward
the
bell-rope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
should
like
Henry
to
hear
what
you
have
told
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
footman
appeared
,
to
whom
she
gravely
added
:
``
If
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
*NL*
has
finished
reading
the
newspaper
,
please
ask
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
``
reading
the
newspaper
''
in
the
tone
in
which
a
Minister
's
wife
*NL*
might
have
said
:
``
Presiding
at
a
Cabinet
meeting
''
--
not
from
any
*NL*
arrogance
of
mind
,
but
because
the
habit
of
a
life-time
,
and
the
*NL*
attitude
of
her
friends
and
relations
,
had
led
her
to
consider
Mr.
van
*NL*
der
Luyden
's
least
gesture
as
having
an
almost
sacerdotal
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
promptness
of
action
showed
that
she
considered
the
case
as
*NL*
pressing
as
Mrs.
Archer
;
but
,
lest
she
should
be
thought
to
have
*NL*
committed
herself
in
advance
,
she
added
,
with
the
sweetest
look
:
*NL*
``
Henry
always
enjoys
seeing
you
,
dear
Adeline
;
and
he
will
wish
to
*NL*
congratulate
Newland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
double
doors
had
solemnly
reopened
and
between
them
appeared
Mr.
*NL*
Henry
van
der
Luyden
,
tall
,
spare
and
frock-coated
,
with
faded
fair
*NL*
hair
,
a
straight
nose
like
his
wife
's
and
the
same
look
of
frozen
*NL*
gentleness
in
eyes
that
were
merely
pale
grey
instead
of
pale
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
greeted
Mrs.
Archer
with
cousinly
affability
,
*NL*
proffered
to
Newland
low-voiced
congratulations
couched
in
the
same
*NL*
language
as
his
wife
's
,
and
seated
himself
in
one
of
the
brocade
*NL*
armchairs
with
the
simplicity
of
a
reigning
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
just
finished
reading
the
Times
,
''
he
said
,
laying
his
long
*NL*
finger-tips
together
.
``
In
town
my
mornings
are
so
much
occupied
that
I
*NL*
find
it
more
convenient
to
read
the
newspapers
after
luncheon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
's
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that
plan
--
indeed
I
think
my
*NL*
uncle
Egmont
used
to
say
he
found
it
less
agitating
not
to
read
the
*NL*
morning
papers
till
after
dinner
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
responsively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
my
good
father
abhorred
hurry
.
But
now
we
live
in
a
constant
*NL*
rush
,
''
said
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
in
measured
tones
,
looking
with
pleasant
*NL*
deliberation
about
the
large
shrouded
room
which
to
Archer
was
so
*NL*
complete
an
image
of
its
owners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
you
HAD
finished
your
reading
,
Henry
?
''
his
wife
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
--
quite
,
''
he
reassured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
should
like
Adeline
to
tell
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
really
Newland
's
story
,
''
said
his
mother
smiling
;
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
rehearse
once
more
the
monstrous
tale
of
the
affront
*NL*
inflicted
on
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
she
ended
,
``
Augusta
Welland
and
Mary
Mingott
both
felt
*NL*
that
,
especially
in
view
of
Newland
's
engagement
,
you
and
Henry
OUGHT
*NL*
TO
KNOW
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
''
said
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
,
drawing
a
deep
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
during
which
the
tick
of
the
monumental
ormolu
*NL*
clock
on
the
white
marble
mantelpiece
grew
as
loud
as
the
boom
of
a
*NL*
minute-gun
.
Archer
contemplated
with
awe
the
two
slender
faded
*NL*
figures
,
seated
side
by
side
in
a
kind
of
viceregal
rigidity
,
*NL*
mouthpieces
of
some
remote
ancestral
authority
which
fate
compelled
*NL*
them
to
wield
,
when
they
would
so
much
rather
have
lived
in
simplicity
*NL*
and
seclusion
,
digging
invisible
weeds
out
of
the
perfect
lawns
of
*NL*
Skuytercliff
,
and
playing
Patience
together
in
the
evenings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
was
the
first
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
think
this
is
due
to
some
--
some
intentional
interference
of
*NL*
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
?
''
he
enquired
,
turning
to
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
certain
of
it
,
sir
.
Larry
has
been
going
it
rather
harder
than
*NL*
usual
lately
--
if
cousin
Louisa
wo
n't
mind
my
mentioning
it
--
having
*NL*
rather
a
stiff
affair
with
the
postmaster
's
wife
in
their
village
,
or
*NL*
some
one
of
that
sort
;
and
whenever
poor
Gertrude
Lefferts
begins
to
*NL*
suspect
anything
,
and
he
's
afraid
of
trouble
,
he
gets
up
a
fuss
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
to
show
how
awfully
moral
he
is
,
and
talks
at
the
top
of
his
*NL*
voice
about
the
impertinence
of
inviting
his
wife
to
meet
people
he
*NL*
does
n't
wish
her
to
know
.
He
's
simply
using
Madame
Olenska
as
a
*NL*
lightning-rod
;
I
've
seen
him
try
the
same
thing
often
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
LEFFERTSES
!

''
said
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
LEFFERTSES
!
--
''
echoed
Mrs.
Archer
.
``
What
would
uncle
Egmont
have
*NL*
said
of
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
pronouncing
on
anybody
's
social
position
?
*NL*
It
shows
what
Society
has
come
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
hope
it
has
not
quite
come
to
that

said
Mr.
van

Luyden
*NL*
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
only
you
and
Louisa
went
out
more
!
''
sighed
Mrs.
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
instantly
she
became
aware
of
her
mistake
.
The
van
der
Luydens
*NL*
were
morbidly
sensitive
to
any
criticism
of
their
secluded
existence
.
*NL*
They
were
the
arbiters
of
fashion
,
the
Court
of
last
Appeal
,
and
they
*NL*
knew
it
,
and
bowed
to
their
fate
.
But
being
shy
and
retiring
persons
,
*NL*
with
no
natural
inclination
for
their
part
,
they
lived
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
in
the
sylvan
solitude
of
Skuytercliff
,
and
when
they
came
to
*NL*
town
,
declined
all
invitations
on
the
plea
of
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
*NL*
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
came
to
his
mother
's
rescue
.
``
Everybody
in
New
York
*NL*
knows
what
you
and
cousin
Louisa
represent
.
That
's
why
Mrs.
Mingott
*NL*
felt
she
ought
not
to
allow
this
slight
on
Countess
Olenska
to
pass
*NL*
without
consulting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
glanced
at
her
husband
,
who
glanced
back
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
principle
that
I
dislike
,
''
said
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
.
``
As
*NL*
long
as
a
member
of
a
well-known
family
is
backed
up
by
that
family
it
*NL*
should
be
considered
--
final
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
so
to
me
,
''
said
his
wife
,
as
if
she
were
producing
a
new
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
idea

''
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
continued
,
``
that
things
had
come
to
*NL*
such
a
pass
.
''
He
paused
,
and
looked
at
his
wife
again
.
``
It
occurs
to
*NL*
me
,
my
dear
,
that
the
Countess
Olenska
is
already
a
sort
of
*NL*
relation
--
through
Medora
Manson
's
first
husband
.
At
any
rate
,
she
will
*NL*
be
when
Newland
marries

He
turned
toward
the
young
man
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
read
this
morning
's
Times

Newland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Archer
,
who
usually
tossed
off
half
a
dozen
*NL*
papers
with
his
morning
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Husband
and
wife
looked
at
each
other
again
.
Their
pale
eyes
clung
*NL*
together
in
prolonged
and
serious
consultation
;
then
a
faint
smile
*NL*
fluttered
over
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
face
.
She
had
evidently
guessed
*NL*
and
approved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
turned
to
Mrs.
Archer
.
``
If
Louisa
's
health
allowed
*NL*
her
to
dine
out

I
wish
you
would
say
to
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
--
she
and
I
*NL*
would
have
been
happy
to
--
er
--
fill
the
places
of
the
Lawrence
*NL*
Leffertses
at
her
dinner
.
''
He
paused
to
let
the
irony
of
this
sink
in
.
*NL*
``
As
you
know
,
this
is
impossible
.
''
Mrs.
Archer
sounded
a
sympathetic
*NL*
assent
.
``
But
Newland
tells
me
he
has
read
this
morning
's
Times
;
*NL*
therefore
he
has
probably
seen
that
Louisa
's
relative
,
the
Duke
of
St.
*NL*
Austrey
,
arrives
next
week
on
the
Russia
.
He
is
coming
to
enter
his
*NL*
new
sloop
,
the
Guinevere
,
in
next
summer
's
International
Cup
Race
;
and
*NL*
also
to
have
a
little
canvasback
shooting
at
Trevenna
.
''
Mr.
van
der
*NL*
Luyden
paused
again
,
and
continued
with
increasing
benevolence
:
*NL*
``
Before
taking
him
down
to
Maryland
we
are
inviting
a
few
friends
to

meet
him
here

only
a

dinner

with
a
reception
afterward

sure

be
as
glad
as
I
am

Countess
Olenska
will
let

include

He
got
up
,
bent
his
long
body
with
a
*NL*
stiff
friendliness
toward
his
cousin
,
and
added
:
``
I
think
I
have
*NL*
Louisa

authority
for
saying
that

will
herself
leave
the

invitation

dine
when
she
drives
out
presently

with
our
cards

of

course
with
our
cards

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
,
who
knew
this
to
be
a
hint
that
the
seventeen-hand
*NL*
chestnuts
which
were
never
kept
waiting
were
at
the
door
,
rose
with
a
*NL*
hurried
murmur
of
thanks
.
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
beamed
on
her
with
the
*NL*
smile
of
Esther
interceding
with
Ahasuerus
;
but
her
husband
raised
a
*NL*
protesting
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
to
thank
me
for
,
dear
Adeline
;
nothing
whatever
.
*NL*
This
kind
of
thing
must
not
happen
in
New
York
;
it
shall
not
,
as
long
*NL*
as
I
can
help
it
,
''
he
pronounced
with
sovereign
gentleness
as
he
*NL*
steered
his
cousins
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
later
,
every
one
knew
that
the
great
C-spring
barouche
in
*NL*
which
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
took
the
air
at
all
seasons
had
been
seen
at
*NL*
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
door
,
where
a
large
square
envelope
was
handed
in
;
*NL*
and
that
evening
at
the
Opera
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
was
able
to
state
*NL*
that
the
envelope
contained
a
card
inviting
the
Countess
Olenska
to
the
*NL*
dinner
which
the
van
der
Luydens
were
giving
the
following
week
for
*NL*
their
cousin
,
the
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
younger
men
in
the
club
box
exchanged
a
smile
at
this
*NL*
announcement
,
and
glanced
sideways
at
Lawrence
Lefferts
,
who
sat
*NL*
carelessly
in
the
front
of
the
box
,
pulling
his
long
fair
moustache
,
*NL*
and
who
remarked
with
authority
,
as
the
soprano
paused
:
``
No
one
but
*NL*
Patti
ought
to
attempt
the
Sonnambula
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
generally
agreed
in
New
York
that
the
Countess
Olenska
had
``
lost
*NL*
her
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
appeared
there
first
,
in
Newland
Archer
's
boyhood
,
as
a
*NL*
brilliantly
pretty
little
girl
of
nine
or
ten
,
of
whom
people
said
that
*NL*
she
``
ought
to
be
painted
.
''
Her
parents
had
been
continental
wanderers
,
*NL*
and
after
a
roaming
babyhood
she
had
lost
them
both
,
and
been
taken
in
*NL*
charge
by
her
aunt
,
Medora
Manson
,
also
a
wanderer
,
who
was
herself
*NL*
returning
to
New
York
to
``
settle
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Medora
,
repeatedly
widowed
,
was
always
coming
home
to
settle
down
*NL*
-LRB-
each
time
in
a
less
expensive
house
-RRB-
,
and
bringing
with
her
a
new
*NL*
husband
or
an
adopted
child
;
but
after
a
few
months
she
invariably
*NL*
parted
from
her
husband
or
quarrelled
with
her
ward
,
and
,
having
got
*NL*
rid
of
her
house
at
a
loss
,
set
out
again
on
her
wanderings
.
As
her
*NL*
mother
had
been
a
Rushworth
,
and
her
last
unhappy
marriage
had
linked
*NL*
her
to
one
of
the
crazy
Chiverses
,
New
York
looked
indulgently
on
her
*NL*
eccentricities
;
but
when
she
returned
with
her
little
orphaned
niece
,
*NL*
whose
parents
had
been
popular
in
spite
of
their
regrettable
taste
for
*NL*
travel
,
people
thought
it
a
pity
that
the
pretty
child
should
be
in
*NL*
such
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
was
disposed
to
be
kind
to
little
Ellen
Mingott
,
though
her
*NL*
dusky
red
cheeks
and
tight
curls
gave
her
an
air
of
gaiety
that
seemed
*NL*
unsuitable
in
a
child
who
should
still
have
been
in
black
for
her
*NL*
parents
.
It
was
one
of
the
misguided
Medora
's
many
peculiarities
to
*NL*
flout
the
unalterable
rules
that
regulated
American
mourning
,
and
when
*NL*
she
stepped
from
the
steamer
her
family
were
scandalised
to
see
that
*NL*
the
crape
veil
she
wore
for
her
own
brother
was
seven
inches
shorter
*NL*
than
those
of
her
sisters-in-law
,
while
little
Ellen
was
in
crimson
*NL*
merino
and
amber
beads
,
like
a
gipsy
foundling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
New
York
had
so
long
resigned
itself
to
Medora
that
only
a
few
old
*NL*
ladies
shook
their
heads
over
Ellen
's
gaudy
clothes
,
while
her
other
*NL*
relations
fell
under
the
charm
of
her
high
colour
and
high
spirits
.
*NL*
She
was
a
fearless
and
familiar
little
thing
,
who
asked
disconcerting
*NL*
questions
,
made
precocious
comments
,
and
possessed
outlandish
arts
,
*NL*
such
as
dancing
a
Spanish
shawl
dance
and
singing
Neapolitan
love-songs
*NL*
to
a
guitar
.
Under
the
direction
of
her
aunt
-LRB-
whose
real
name
was
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorley
Chivers
,
but
who
,
having
received
a
Papal
title
,
had
resumed
*NL*
her
first
husband
's
patronymic
,
and
called
herself
the
Marchioness
*NL*
Manson
,
because
in
Italy
she
could
turn
it
into
Manzoni
-RRB-
the
little
*NL*
girl
received
an
expensive
but
incoherent
education
,
which
included
*NL*
``
drawing
from
the
model
,
''
a
thing
never
dreamed
of
before
,
and
playing
*NL*
the
piano
in
quintets
with
professional
musicians
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
no
good
could
come
of
this
;
and
when
,
a
few
years
later
,
poor
*NL*
Chivers
finally
died
in
a
madhouse
,
his
widow
-LRB-
draped
in
strange
weeds
-RRB-
*NL*
again
pulled
up
stakes
and
departed
with
Ellen
,
who
had
grown
into
a
*NL*
tall
bony
girl
with
conspicuous
eyes
.
For
some
time
no
more
was
heard
*NL*
of
them
;
then
news
came
of
Ellen
's
marriage
to
an
immensely
rich
Polish
*NL*
nobleman
of
legendary
fame
,
whom
she
had
met
at
a
ball
at
the
*NL*
Tuileries
,
and
who
was
said
to
have
princely
establishments
in
Paris
,
*NL*
Nice
and
Florence
,
a
yacht
at
Cowes
,
and
many
square
miles
of
shooting
*NL*
in
Transylvania
.
She
disappeared
in
a
kind
of
sulphurous
apotheosis
,
*NL*
and
when
a
few
years
later
Medora
again
came
back
to
New
York
,
subdued
,
*NL*
impoverished
,
mourning
a
third
husband
,
and
in
quest
of
a
still
smaller
*NL*
house
,
people
wondered
that
her
rich
niece
had
not
been
able
to
do
*NL*
something
for
her
.
Then
came
the
news
that
Ellen
's
own
marriage
had
*NL*
ended
in
disaster
,
and
that
she
was
herself
returning
home
to
seek
rest
*NL*
and
oblivion
among
her
kinsfolk
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
passed
through
Newland
Archer
's
mind
a
week
later
as
he
*NL*
watched
the
Countess
Olenska
enter
the
van
der
Luyden
drawing-room
on
*NL*
the
evening
of
the
momentous
dinner
.
The
occasion
was
a
solemn
one
,
*NL*
and
he
wondered
a
little
nervously
how
she
would
carry
it
off
.
She
*NL*
came
rather
late
,
one
hand
still
ungloved
,
and
fastening
a
bracelet
*NL*
about
her
wrist
;
yet
she
entered
without
any
appearance
of
haste
or
*NL*
embarrassment
the
drawing-room
in
which
New
York
's
most
chosen
company
*NL*
was
somewhat
awfully
assembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
room
she
paused
,
looking
about
her
with
a
grave
*NL*
mouth
and
smiling
eyes
;
and
in
that
instant
Newland
Archer
rejected
the
*NL*
general
verdict
on
her
looks
.
It
was
true
that
her
early
radiance
was
*NL*
gone
.
The
red
cheeks
had
paled
;
she
was
thin
,
worn
,
a
little
*NL*
older-looking
than
her
age
,
which
must
have
been
nearly
thirty
.
But
*NL*
there
was
about
her
the
mysterious
authority
of
beauty
,
a
sureness
in
*NL*
the
carriage
of
the
head
,
the
movement
of
the
eyes
,
which
,
without
*NL*
being
in
the
least
theatrical
,
struck
his
as
highly
trained
and
full
of
*NL*
a
conscious
power
.
At
the
same
time
she
was
simpler
in
manner
than
*NL*
most
of
the
ladies
present
,
and
many
people
-LRB-
as
he
heard
afterward
from
*NL*
Janey
-RRB-
were
disappointed
that
her
appearance
was
not
more
*NL*
``
stylish
''
--
for
stylishness
was
what
New
York
most
valued
.
It
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
Archer
reflected
,
because
her
early
vivacity
had
disappeared
;
*NL*
because
she
was
so
quiet
--
quiet
in
her
movements
,
her
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
tones
of
her
low-pitched
voice
.
New
York
had
expected
something
a
good
*NL*
deal
more
reasonant
in
a
young
woman
with
such
a
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
a
somewhat
formidable
business
.
Dining
with
the
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
was
at
best
no
light
matter
,
and
dining
there
with
a
Duke
who
*NL*
was
their
cousin
was
almost
a
religious
solemnity
.
It
pleased
Archer
*NL*
to
think
that
only
an
old
New
Yorker
could
perceive
the
shade
of
*NL*
difference
-LRB-
to
New
York
-RRB-
between
being
merely
a
Duke
and
being
the
van
*NL*
der
Luydens
'
Duke
.
New
York
took
stray
noblemen
calmly
,
and
even
*NL*
-LRB-
except
in
the
Struthers
set
-RRB-
with
a
certain
distrustful
hauteur
;
but
*NL*
when
they
presented
such
credentials
as
these
they
were
received
with
*NL*
an
old-fashioned
cordiality
that
they
would
have
been
greatly
mistaken
*NL*
in
ascribing
solely
to
their
standing
in
Debrett
.
It
was
for
just
such
*NL*
distinctions
that
the
young
man
cherished
his
old
New
York
even
while
*NL*
he
smiled
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
van
der
Luydens
had
done
their
best
to
emphasise
the
importance
of
*NL*
the
occasion
.
The
du
Lac
Sevres
and
the
Trevenna
George
II
plate
were
*NL*
out
;
so
was
the
van
der
Luyden
``
Lowestoft
''
-LRB-
East
India
Company
-RRB-
and
the
*NL*
Dagonet
Crown
Derby
.
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
*NL*
Cabanel
,
and
Mrs.
Archer
,
in
her
grandmother
's
seed-pearls
and
*NL*
emeralds
,
reminded
her
son
of
an
Isabey
miniature
.
All
the
ladies
had
*NL*
on
their
handsomest
jewels
,
but
it
was
characteristic
of
the
house
and
*NL*
the
occasion
that
these
were
mostly
in
rather
heavy
old-fashioned
*NL*
settings
;
and
old
Miss
Lanning
,
who
had
been
persuaded
to
come
,
*NL*
actually
wore
her
mother
's
cameos
and
a
Spanish
blonde
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Olenska
was
the
only
young
woman
at
the
dinner
;
yet
,
as
*NL*
Archer
scanned
the
smooth
plump
elderly
faces
between
their
diamond
*NL*
necklaces
and
towering
ostrich
feathers
,
they
struck
him
as
curiously
*NL*
immature
compared
with
hers
.
It
frightened
him
to
think
what
must
have
*NL*
gone
to
the
making
of
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
,
who
sat
at
his
hostess
's
right
,
was
naturally
*NL*
the
chief
figure
of
the
evening
.
But
if
the
Countess
Olenska
was
less
*NL*
conspicuous
than
had
been
hoped
,
the
Duke
was
almost
invisible
.
Being
*NL*
a
well-bred
man
he
had
not
-LRB-
like
another
recent
ducal
visitor
-RRB-
come
to
*NL*
the
dinner
in
a
shooting-jacket
;
but
his
evening
clothes
were
so
shabby
*NL*
and
baggy
,
and
he
wore
them
with
such
an
air
of
their
being
homespun
,
*NL*
that
-LRB-
with
his
stooping
way
of
sitting
,
and
the
vast
beard
spreading
*NL*
over
his
shirt-front
-RRB-
he
hardly
gave
the
appearance
of
being
in
dinner
*NL*
attire
.
He
was
short
,
round-shouldered
,
sunburnt
,
with
a
thick
nose
,
*NL*
small
eyes
and
a
sociable
smile
;
but
he
seldom
spoke
,
and
when
he
did
*NL*
it
was
in
such
low
tones
that
,
despite
the
frequent
silences
of
*NL*
expectation
about
the
table
,
his
remarks
were
lost
to
all
but
his
*NL*
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
men
joined
the
ladies
after
dinner
the
Duke
went
straight
up
*NL*
to
the
Countess
Olenska
,
and
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
plunged
into
*NL*
animated
talk
.
Neither
seemed
aware
that
the
Duke
should
first
have
*NL*
paid
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
Mrs.
Headly
Chivers
,
and
*NL*
the
Countess
have
conversed
with
that
amiable
hypochondriac
,
Mr.
Urban
*NL*
Dagonet
of
Washington
Square
,
who
,
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
meeting
her
,
had
broken
through
his
fixed
rule
of
not
dining
out
*NL*
between
January
and
April
.
The
two
chatted
together
for
nearly
twenty
*NL*
minutes
;
then
the
Countess
rose
and
,
walking
alone
across
the
wide
*NL*
drawing-room
,
sat
down
at
Newland
Archer
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
custom
in
New
York
drawing-rooms
for
a
lady
to
get
up
*NL*
and
walk
away
from
one
gentleman
in
order
to
seek
the
company
of
*NL*
another
.
Etiquette
required
that
she
should
wait
,
immovable
as
an
*NL*
idol
,
while
the
men
who
wished
to
converse
with
her
succeeded
each
*NL*
other
at
her
side
.
But
the
Countess
was
apparently
unaware
of
having
*NL*
broken
any
rule
;
she
sat
at
perfect
ease
in
a
corner
of
the
sofa
beside
*NL*
Archer
,
and
looked
at
him
with
the
kindest
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
talk
to
me
about
May
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
answering
her
he
asked
:
``
You
knew
the
Duke
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
--
we
used
to
see
him
every
winter
at
Nice
.
He
's
very
fond
of
*NL*
gambling
--
he
used
to
come
to
the
house
a
great
deal
.
''
She
said
it
in
*NL*
the
simplest
manner
,
as
if
she
had
said
:
``
He
's
fond
of
wild-flowers
''
;
*NL*
and
after
a
moment
she
added
candidly
:
``
I
think
he
's
the
dullest
man
I
*NL*
ever
met
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleased
her
companion
so
much
that
he
forgot
the
slight
shock
her
*NL*
previous
remark
had
caused
him
.
It
was
undeniably
exciting
to
meet
a
*NL*
lady
who
found
the
van
der
Luydens
'
Duke
dull
,
and
dared
to
utter
the
*NL*
opinion
.
He
longed
to
question
her
,
to
hear
more
about
the
life
of
*NL*
which
her
careless
words
had
given
him
so
illuminating
a
glimpse
;
but
*NL*
he
feared
to
touch
on
distressing
memories
,
and
before
he
could
think
*NL*
of
anything
to
say
she
had
strayed
back
to
her
original
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
is
a
darling
;
I
've
seen
no
young
girl
in
New
York
so
handsome
and
*NL*
so
intelligent
.
Are
you
very
much
in
love
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
reddened
and
laughed
.
``
As
much
as
a
man
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
to
consider
him
thoughtfully
,
as
if
not
to
miss
any
shade
*NL*
of
meaning
in
what
he
said
,
``
Do
you
think
,
then
,
there
is
a
limit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
being
in
love
?
If
there
is
,
I
have
n't
found
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glowed
with
sympathy
.
``
Ah
--
it
's
really
and
truly
a
romance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
romantic
of
romances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delightful
!
And
you
found
it
all
out
for
yourselves
--
it
was
not
*NL*
in
the
least
arranged
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
at
her
incredulously
.
``
Have
you
forgotten
,
''
he
asked
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
``
that
in
our
country
we
do
n't
allow
our
marriages
to
be
*NL*
arranged
for
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
dusky
blush
rose
to
her
cheek
,
and
he
instantly
regretted
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
'd
forgotten
.
You
must
forgive
me
if
I
*NL*
sometimes
make
these
mistakes
.
I
do
n't
always
remember
that
everything
*NL*
here
is
good
that
was
--
that
was
bad
where
I
've
come
from
.
''
She
looked
*NL*
down
at
her
Viennese
fan
of
eagle
feathers
,
and
he
saw
that
her
lips
*NL*
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
he
said
impulsively
;
``
but
you
ARE
among
friends
here
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
know
.
Wherever
I
go
I
have
that
feeling
.
That
's
why
I
came
*NL*
home
.
I
want
to
forget
everything
else
,
to
become
a
complete
American
*NL*
again
,
like
the
Mingotts
and
Wellands
,
and
you
and
your
delightful
*NL*
mother
,
and
all
the
other
good
people
here
tonight
.
Ah
,
here
's
May
*NL*
arriving
,
and
you
will
want
to
hurry
away
to
her
,
''
she
added
,
but
*NL*
without
moving
;
and
her
eyes
turned
back
from
the
door
to
rest
on
the
*NL*
young
man
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawing-rooms
were
beginning
to
fill
up
with
after-dinner
guests
,
*NL*
and
following
Madame
Olenska
's
glance
Archer
saw
May
Welland
entering
*NL*
with
her
mother
.
In
her
dress
of
white
and
silver
,
with
a
wreath
of
*NL*
silver
blossoms
in
her
hair
,
the
tall
girl
looked
like
a
Diana
just
*NL*
alight
from
the
chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Archer
,
``
I
have
so
many
rivals
;
you
see
she
's
already
*NL*
surrounded
.
There
's
the
Duke
being
introduced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
stay
with
me
a
little
longer
,
''
Madame
Olenska
said
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
just
touching
his
knee
with
her
plumed
fan
.
It
was
the
lightest
touch
,
*NL*
but
it
thrilled
him
like
a
caress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
let
me
stay
,
''
he
answered
in
the
same
tone
,
hardly
knowing
what
*NL*
he
said
;
but
just
then
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
came
up
,
followed
by
old
Mr.
*NL*
Urban
Dagonet
.
The
Countess
greeted
them
with
her
grave
smile
,
and
*NL*
Archer
,
feeling
his
host
's
admonitory
glance
on
him
,
rose
and
*NL*
surrendered
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
held
out
her
hand
as
if
to
bid
him
goodbye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
,
then
,
after
five
--
I
shall
expect
you
,
''
she
said
;
and
then
*NL*
turned
back
to
make
room
for
Mr.
Dagonet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
--
''
Archer
heard
himself
repeating
,
though
there
had
been
no
*NL*
engagement
,
and
during
their
talk
she
had
given
him
no
hint
that
she
*NL*
wished
to
see
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
moved
away
he
saw
Lawrence
Lefferts
,
tall
and
resplendent
,
*NL*
leading
his
wife
up
to
be
introduced
;
and
heard
Gertrude
Lefferts
say
,
*NL*
as
she
beamed
on
the
Countess
with
her
large
unperceiving
smile
:
``
But
*NL*
I
think
we
used
to
go
to
dancing-school
together
when
we
were
*NL*
children
--
.
''
Behind
her
,
waiting
their
turn
to
name
themselves
to
the
*NL*
Countess
,
Archer
noticed
a
number
of
the
recalcitrant
couples
who
had
*NL*
declined
to
meet
her
at
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
's
.
As
Mrs.
Archer
*NL*
remarked
:
when
the
van
der
Luydens
chose
,
they
knew
how
to
give
a
*NL*
lesson
.
The
wonder
was
that
they
chose
so
seldom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
felt
a
touch
on
his
arm
and
saw
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
*NL*
looking
down
on
him
from
the
pure
eminence
of
black
velvet
and
the
*NL*
family
diamonds
.
``
It
was
good
of
you
,
dear
Newland
,
to
devote
yourself
*NL*
so
unselfishly
to
Madame
Olenska
.
I
told
your
cousin
Henry
he
must
*NL*
really
come
to
the
rescue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aware
of
smiling
at
her
vaguely
,
and
she
added
,
as
if
*NL*
condescending
to
his
natural
shyness
:
``
I
've
never
seen
May
looking
*NL*
lovelier
.
The
Duke
thinks
her
the
handsomest
girl
in
the
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Olenska
had
said
``
after
five
''
;
and
at
half
after
the
hour
*NL*
Newland
Archer
rang
the
bell
of
the
peeling
stucco
house
with
a
giant
*NL*
wisteria
throttling
its
feeble
cast-iron
balcony
,
which
she
had
hired
,
*NL*
far
down
West
Twenty-third
Street
,
from
the
vagabond
Medora
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
a
strange
quarter
to
have
settled
in
.
Small
*NL*
dress-makers
,
bird-stuffers
and
``
people
who
wrote
''
were
her
nearest
*NL*
neighbours
;
and
further
down
the
dishevelled
street
Archer
recognised
a
*NL*
dilapidated
wooden
house
,
at
the
end
of
a
paved
path
,
in
which
a
writer
*NL*
and
journalist
called
Winsett
,
whom
he
used
to
come
across
now
and
*NL*
then
,
had
mentioned
that
he
lived
.
Winsett
did
not
invite
people
to
*NL*
his
house
;
but
he
had
once
pointed
it
out
to
Archer
in
the
course
of
a
*NL*
nocturnal
stroll
,
and
the
latter
had
asked
himself
,
with
a
little
*NL*
shiver
,
if
the
humanities
were
so
meanly
housed
in
other
capitals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
's
own
dwelling
was
redeemed
from
the
same
appearance
*NL*
only
by
a
little
more
paint
about
the
window-frames
;
and
as
Archer
*NL*
mustered
its
modest
front
he
said
to
himself
that
the
Polish
Count
must
*NL*
have
robbed
her
of
her
fortune
as
well
as
of
her
illusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
had
spent
an
unsatisfactory
day
.
He
had
lunched
with
the
*NL*
Wellands
,
hoping
afterward
to
carry
off
May
for
a
walk
in
the
Park
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
have
her
to
himself
,
to
tell
her
how
enchanting
she
had
*NL*
looked
the
night
before
,
and
how
proud
he
was
of
her
,
and
to
press
her
*NL*
to
hasten
their
marriage
.
But
Mrs.
Welland
had
firmly
reminded
him
*NL*
that
the
round
of
family
visits
was
not
half
over
,
and
,
when
he
hinted
*NL*
at
advancing
the
date
of
the
wedding
,
had
raised
reproachful
eye-brows
*NL*
and
sighed
out
:
``
Twelve
dozen
of
everything
--
hand-embroidered
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Packed
in
the
family
landau
they
rolled
from
one
tribal
doorstep
to
*NL*
another
,
and
Archer
,
when
the
afternoon
's
round
was
over
,
parted
from
*NL*
his
betrothed
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
been
shown
off
like
a
wild
*NL*
animal
cunningly
trapped
.
He
supposed
that
his
readings
in
*NL*
anthropology
caused
him
to
take
such
a
coarse
view
of
what
was
after
*NL*
all
a
simple
and
natural
demonstration
of
family
feeling
;
but
when
he
*NL*
remembered
that
the
Wellands
did
not
expect
the
wedding
to
take
place
*NL*
till
the
following
autumn
,
and
pictured
what
his
life
would
be
till
*NL*
then
,
a
dampness
fell
upon
his
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
called
after
him
,
``
we
'll
do
the
Chiverses
and
*NL*
the
Dallases
''
;
and
he
perceived
that
she
was
going
through
their
two
*NL*
families
alphabetically
,
and
that
they
were
only
in
the
first
quarter
*NL*
of
the
alphabet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
meant
to
tell
May
of
the
Countess
Olenska
's
request
--
her
*NL*
command
,
rather
--
that
he
should
call
on
her
that
afternoon
;
but
in
the
*NL*
brief
moments
when
they
were
alone
he
had
had
more
pressing
things
to
*NL*
say
.
Besides
,
it
struck
him
as
a
little
absurd
to
allude
to
the
*NL*
matter
.
He
knew
that
May
most
particularly
wanted
him
to
be
kind
to
*NL*
her
cousin
;
was
it
not
that
wish
which
had
hastened
the
announcement
of
*NL*
their
engagement
?
It
gave
him
an
odd
sensation
to
reflect
that
,
but
*NL*
for
the
Countess
's
arrival
,
he
might
have
been
,
if
not
still
a
free
*NL*
man
,
at
least
a
man
less
irrevocably
pledged
.
But
May
had
willed
it
*NL*
so
,
and
he
felt
himself
somehow
relieved
of
further
responsibility
--
and
*NL*
therefore
at
liberty
,
if
he
chose
,
to
call
on
her
cousin
without
*NL*
telling
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
stood
on
Madame
Olenska
's
threshold
curiosity
was
his
uppermost
*NL*
feeling
.
He
was
puzzled
by
the
tone
in
which
she
had
summoned
him
;
he
*NL*
concluded
that
she
was
less
simple
than
she
seemed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
opened
by
a
swarthy
foreign-looking
maid
,
with
a
prominent
*NL*
bosom
under
a
gay
neckerchief
,
whom
he
vaguely
fancied
to
be
Sicilian
.
*NL*
She
welcomed
him
with
all
her
white
teeth
,
and
answering
his
enquiries
*NL*
by
a
head-shake
of
incomprehension
led
him
through
the
narrow
hall
into
*NL*
a
low
firelit
drawing-room
.
The
room
was
empty
,
and
she
left
him
,
for
*NL*
an
appreciable
time
,
to
wonder
whether
she
had
gone
to
find
her
*NL*
mistress
,
or
whether
she
had
not
understood
what
he
was
there
for
,
and
*NL*
thought
it
might
be
to
wind
the
clock
--
of
which
he
perceived
that
the
*NL*
only
visible
specimen
had
stopped
.
He
knew
that
the
southern
races
*NL*
communicated
with
each
other
in
the
language
of
pantomime
,
and
was
*NL*
mortified
to
find
her
shrugs
and
smiles
so
unintelligible
.
At
length
*NL*
she
returned
with
a
lamp
;
and
Archer
,
having
meanwhile
put
together
a
*NL*
phrase
out
of
Dante
and
Petrarch
,
evoked
the
answer
:
``
La
signora
e
*NL*
fuori
;
ma
verra
subito
''
;
which
he
took
to
mean
:
``
She
's
out
--
but
you
'll
*NL*
soon
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
saw
,
meanwhile
,
with
the
help
of
the
lamp
,
was
the
faded
*NL*
shadowy
charm
of
a
room
unlike
any
room
he
had
known
.
He
knew
that
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
had
brought
some
of
her
possessions
with
her
--
bits
of
*NL*
wreckage
,
she
called
them
--
and
these
,
he
supposed
,
were
represented
by
*NL*
some
small
slender
tables
of
dark
wood
,
a
delicate
little
Greek
bronze
*NL*
on
the
chimney-piece
,
and
a
stretch
of
red
damask
nailed
on
the
*NL*
discoloured
wallpaper
behind
a
couple
of
Italian-looking
pictures
in
*NL*
old
frames
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
prided
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
Italian
art
.
His
*NL*
boyhood
had
been
saturated
with
Ruskin
,
and
he
had
read
all
the
latest
*NL*
books
:
John
Addington
Symonds
,
Vernon
Lee
's
``
Euphorion
,
''
the
essays
of
*NL*
P.
G.
Hamerton
,
and
a
wonderful
new
volume
called
``
The
Renaissance
''
by
*NL*
Walter
Pater
.
He
talked
easily
of
Botticelli
,
and
spoke
of
Fra
*NL*
Angelico
with
a
faint
condescension
.
But
these
pictures
bewildered
*NL*
him
,
for
they
were
like
nothing
that
he
was
accustomed
to
look
at
-LRB-
and
*NL*
therefore
able
to
see
-RRB-
when
he
travelled
in
Italy
;
and
perhaps
,
also
,
*NL*
his
powers
of
observation
were
impaired
by
the
oddness
of
finding
*NL*
himself
in
this
strange
empty
house
,
where
apparently
no
one
expected
*NL*
him
.
He
was
sorry
that
he
had
not
told
May
Welland
of
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
's
request
,
and
a
little
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
his
*NL*
betrothed
might
come
in
to
see
her
cousin
.
What
would
she
think
if
she
*NL*
found
him
sitting
there
with
the
air
of
intimacy
implied
by
waiting
*NL*
alone
in
the
dusk
at
a
lady
's
fireside
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
since
he
had
come
he
meant
to
wait
;
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
*NL*
stretched
his
feet
to
the
logs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
odd
to
have
summoned
him
in
that
way
,
and
then
forgotten
him
;
*NL*
but
Archer
felt
more
curious
than
mortified
.
The
atmosphere
of
the
*NL*
room
was
so
different
from
any
he
had
ever
breathed
that
*NL*
self-consciousness
vanished
in
the
sense
of
adventure
.
He
had
been
*NL*
before
in
drawing-rooms
hung
with
red
damask
,
with
pictures
``
of
the
*NL*
Italian
school
''
;
what
struck
him
was
the
way
in
which
Medora
Manson
's
*NL*
shabby
hired
house
,
with
its
blighted
background
of
pampas
grass
and
*NL*
Rogers
statuettes
,
had
,
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
,
and
the
skilful
use
of
a
*NL*
few
properties
,
been
transformed
into
something
intimate
,
``
foreign
,
''
*NL*
subtly
suggestive
of
old
romantic
scenes
and
sentiments
.
He
tried
to
*NL*
analyse
the
trick
,
to
find
a
clue
to
it
in
the
way
the
chairs
and
*NL*
tables
were
grouped
,
in
the
fact
that
only
two
Jacqueminot
roses
-LRB-
of
*NL*
which
nobody
ever
bought
less
than
a
dozen
-RRB-
had
been
placed
in
the
*NL*
slender
vase
at
his
elbow
,
and
in
the
vague
pervading
perfume
that
was
*NL*
not
what
one
put
on
handkerchiefs
,
but
rather
like
the
scent
of
some
*NL*
far-off
bazaar
,
a
smell
made
up
of
Turkish
coffee
and
ambergris
and
*NL*
dried
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
wandered
away
to
the
question
of
what
May
's
drawing-room
would
*NL*
look
like
.
He
knew
that
Mr.
Welland
,
who
was
behaving
``
very
*NL*
handsomely
,
''
already
had
his
eye
on
a
newly
built
house
in
East
*NL*
Thirty-ninth
Street
.
The
neighbourhood
was
thought
remote
,
and
the
*NL*
house
was
built
in
a
ghastly
greenish-yellow
stone
that
the
younger
*NL*
architects
were
beginning
to
employ
as
a
protest
against
the
brownstone
*NL*
of
which
the
uniform
hue
coated
New
York
like
a
cold
chocolate
sauce
;
*NL*
but
the
plumbing
was
perfect
.
Archer
would
have
liked
to
travel
,
to
*NL*
put
off
the
housing
question
;
but
,
though
the
Wellands
approved
of
an
*NL*
extended
European
honeymoon
-LRB-
perhaps
even
a
winter
in
Egypt
-RRB-
,
they
were
*NL*
firm
as
to
the
need
of
a
house
for
the
returning
couple
.
The
young
man
*NL*
felt
that
his
fate
was
sealed
:
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
go
up
*NL*
every
evening
between
the
cast-iron
railings
of
that
greenish-yellow
*NL*
doorstep
,
and
pass
through
a
Pompeian
vestibule
into
a
hall
with
a
*NL*
wainscoting
of
varnished
yellow
wood
.
But
beyond
that
his
imagination
*NL*
could
not
travel
.
He
knew
the
drawing-room
above
had
a
bay
window
,
but
*NL*
he
could
not
fancy
how
May
would
deal
with
it
.
She
submitted
*NL*
cheerfully
to
the
purple
satin
and
yellow
tuftings
of
the
Welland
*NL*
drawing-room
,
to
its
sham
Buhl
tables
and
gilt
vitrines
full
of
modern
*NL*
Saxe
.
He
saw
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
would
want
anything
*NL*
different
in
her
own
house
;
and
his
only
comfort
was
to
reflect
that
*NL*
she
would
probably
let
him
arrange
his
library
as
he
pleased
--
which
*NL*
would
be
,
of
course
,
with
``
sincere
''
Eastlake
furniture
,
and
the
plain
*NL*
new
bookcases
without
glass
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
round-bosomed
maid
came
in
,
drew
the
curtains
,
pushed
back
a
log
,
*NL*
and
said
consolingly
:
``
Verra
--
verra
.
''
When
she
had
gone
Archer
stood
*NL*
up
and
began
to
wander
about
.
Should
he
wait
any
longer
?
His
position
*NL*
was
becoming
rather
foolish
.
Perhaps
he
had
misunderstood
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
--
perhaps
she
had
not
invited
him
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
the
cobblestones
of
the
quiet
street
came
the
ring
of
a
stepper
's
*NL*
hoofs
;
they
stopped
before
the
house
,
and
he
caught
the
opening
of
a
*NL*
carriage
door
.
Parting
the
curtains
he
looked
out
into
the
early
dusk
.
*NL*
A
street-lamp
faced
him
,
and
in
its
light
he
saw
Julius
Beaufort
's
*NL*
compact
English
brougham
,
drawn
by
a
big
roan
,
and
the
banker
*NL*
descending
from
it
,
and
helping
out
Madame
Olenska
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
stood
,
hat
in
hand
,
saying
something
which
his
companion
*NL*
seemed
to
negative
;
then
they
shook
hands
,
and
he
jumped
into
his
*NL*
carriage
while
she
mounted
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
entered
the
room
she
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
Archer
*NL*
there
;
surprise
seemed
the
emotion
that
she
was
least
addicted
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
my
funny
house
?
''
she
asked
.
``
To
me
it
's
like
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
she
untied
her
little
velvet
bonnet
and
tossing
it
away
*NL*
with
her
long
cloak
stood
looking
at
him
with
meditative
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
arranged
it
delightfully
,
''
he
rejoined
,
alive
to
the
flatness
*NL*
of
the
words
,
but
imprisoned
in
the
conventional
by
his
consuming
*NL*
desire
to
be
simple
and
striking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
poor
little
place
.
My
relations
despise
it
.
But
at
any
*NL*
rate
it
's
less
gloomy
than
the
van
der
Luydens
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
gave
him
an
electric
shock
,
for
few
were
the
rebellious
*NL*
spirits
who
would
have
dared
to
call
the
stately
home
of
the
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
gloomy
.
Those
privileged
to
enter
it
shivered
there
,
and
spoke
*NL*
of
it
as
``
handsome
.
''
But
suddenly
he
was
glad
that
she
had
given
voice
*NL*
to
the
general
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
delicious
--
what
you
've
done
here
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
little
house
,
''
she
admitted
;
``
but
I
suppose
what
I
like
is
*NL*
the
blessedness
of
its
being
here
,
in
my
own
country
and
my
own
town
;
*NL*
and
then
,
of
being
alone
in
it
.
''
She
spoke
so
low
that
he
hardly
heard
*NL*
the
last
phrase
;
but
in
his
awkwardness
he
took
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
so
much
to
be
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
as
long
as
my
friends
keep
me
from
feeling
lonely
.
''
She
sat
down
*NL*
near
the
fire
,
said
:
``
Nastasia
will
bring
the
tea
presently
,
''
and
*NL*
signed
to
him
to
return
to
his
armchair
,
adding
:
``
I
see
you
've
already
*NL*
chosen
your
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaning
back
,
she
folded
her
arms
behind
her
head
,
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
fire
under
drooping
lids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
hour
I
like
best
--
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
proper
sense
of
his
dignity
caused
him
to
answer
:
``
I
was
afraid
you
'd
*NL*
forgotten
the
hour
.
Beaufort
must
have
been
very
engrossing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
amused
.
``
Why
--
have
you
waited
long
?
Mr.
Beaufort
took
me
*NL*
to
see
a
number
of
houses
--
since
it
seems
I
'm
not
to
be
allowed
to
stay
*NL*
in
this
one
.
''
She
appeared
to
dismiss
both
Beaufort
and
himself
from
*NL*
her
mind
,
and
went
on
:
``
I
've
never
been
in
a
city
where
there
seems
to
*NL*
be
such
a
feeling
against
living
in
des
quartiers
excentriques
.
What
*NL*
does
it
matter
where
one
lives
?
I
'm
told
this
street
is
respectable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
fashionable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fashionable
!
Do
you
all
think
so
much
of
that
?
Why
not
make
one
's
*NL*
own
fashions
?
But
I
suppose
I
've
lived
too
independently
;
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
I
want
to
do
what
you
all
do
--
I
want
to
feel
cared
for
and
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
touched
,
as
he
had
been
the
evening
before
when
she
spoke
of
her
*NL*
need
of
guidance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
your
friends
want
you
to
feel
.
New
York
's
an
awfully
safe
*NL*
place
,
''
he
added
with
a
flash
of
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
is
n't
it
?
One
feels
that
,
''
she
cried
,
missing
the
mockery
.
*NL*
``
Being
here
is
like
--
like
--
being
taken
on
a
holiday
when
one
has
been
a
*NL*
good
little
girl
and
done
all
one
's
lessons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
analogy
was
well
meant
,
but
did
not
altogether
please
him
.
He
did
*NL*
not
mind
being
flippant
about
New
York
,
but
disliked
to
hear
any
one
*NL*
else
take
the
same
tone
.
He
wondered
if
she
did
not
begin
to
see
what
*NL*
a
powerful
engine
it
was
,
and
how
nearly
it
had
crushed
her
.
The
*NL*
Lovell
Mingotts
'
dinner
,
patched
up
in
extremis
out
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
social
odds
and
ends
,
ought
to
have
taught
her
the
narrowness
of
her
*NL*
escape
;
but
either
she
had
been
all
along
unaware
of
having
skirted
*NL*
disaster
,
or
else
she
had
lost
sight
of
it
in
the
triumph
of
the
van
*NL*
der
Luyden
evening
.
Archer
inclined
to
the
former
theory
;
he
fancied
*NL*
that
her
New
York
was
still
completely
undifferentiated
,
and
the
*NL*
conjecture
nettled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night
,
''
he
said
,
``
New
York
laid
itself
out
for
you
.
The
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
do
nothing
by
halves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
how
kind
they
are
!
It
was
such
a
nice
party
.
Every
one
seems
to
*NL*
have
such
an
esteem
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
terms
were
hardly
adequate
;
she
might
have
spoken
in
that
way
of
a
*NL*
tea-party
at
the
dear
old
Miss
Lannings
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
van
der
Luydens
,
''
said
Archer
,
feeling
himself
pompous
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
``
are
the
most
powerful
influence
in
New
York
society
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
--
owing
to
her
health
--
they
receive
very
seldom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
unclasped
her
hands
from
behind
her
head
,
and
looked
at
him
*NL*
meditatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
perhaps
the
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reason
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
their
great
influence
;
that
they
make
themselves
so
rare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
a
little
,
stared
at
her
--
and
suddenly
felt
the
penetration
*NL*
of
the
remark
.
At
a
stroke
she
had
pricked
the
van
der
Luydens
and
*NL*
they
collapsed
.
He
laughed
,
and
sacrificed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
brought
the
tea
,
with
handleless
Japanese
cups
and
little
*NL*
covered
dishes
,
placing
the
tray
on
a
low
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
explain
these
things
to
me
--
you
'll
tell
me
all
I
ought
to
*NL*
know
,
''
Madame
Olenska
continued
,
leaning
forward
to
hand
him
his
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
who
are
telling
me
;
opening
my
eyes
to
things
I
'd
looked
at
*NL*
so
long
that
I
'd
ceased
to
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
detached
a
small
gold
cigarette-case
from
one
of
her
bracelets
,
*NL*
held
it
out
to
him
,
and
took
a
cigarette
herself
.
On
the
chimney
were
*NL*
long
spills
for
lighting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
we
can
both
help
each
other
.
But
I
want
help
so
much
more
.
*NL*
You
must
tell
me
just
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
reply
:
``
Do
n't
be
seen
driving
about
*NL*
the
streets
with
Beaufort
--
''
but
he
was
being
too
deeply
drawn
into
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
the
room
,
which
was
her
atmosphere
,
and
to
give
advice
of
*NL*
that
sort
would
have
been
like
telling
some
one
who
was
bargaining
for
*NL*
attar-of-roses
in
Samarkand
that
one
should
always
be
provided
with
*NL*
arctics
for
a
New
York
winter
.
New
York
seemed
much
farther
off
than
*NL*
Samarkand
,
and
if
they
were
indeed
to
help
each
other
she
was
rendering
*NL*
what
might
prove
the
first
of
their
mutual
services
by
making
him
look
*NL*
at
his
native
city
objectively
.
Viewed
thus
,
as
through
the
wrong
end
*NL*
of
a
telescope
,
it
looked
disconcertingly
small
and
distant
;
but
then
*NL*
from
Samarkand
it
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flame
darted
from
the
logs
and
she
bent
over
the
fire
,
stretching
her
*NL*
thin
hands
so
close
to
it
that
a
faint
halo
shone
about
the
oval
nails
.
*NL*
The
light
touched
to
russet
the
rings
of
dark
hair
escaping
from
her
*NL*
braids
,
and
made
her
pale
face
paler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
plenty
of
people
to
tell
you
what
to
do
,
''
Archer
rejoined
,
*NL*
obscurely
envious
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
all
my
aunts
?
And
my
dear
old
Granny
?
''
She
considered
the
idea
*NL*
impartially
.
``
They
're
all
a
little
vexed
with
me
for
setting
up
for
*NL*
myself
--
poor
Granny
especially
.
She
wanted
to
keep
me
with
her
;
but
I
*NL*
had
to
be
free
--
''
He
was
impressed
by
this
light
way
of
speaking
of
*NL*
the
formidable
Catherine
,
and
moved
by
the
thought
of
what
must
have
*NL*
given
Madame
Olenska
this
thirst
for
even
the
loneliest
kind
of
*NL*
freedom
.
But
the
idea
of
Beaufort
gnawed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
understand
how
you
feel
,
''
he
said
.
``
Still
,
your
family
can
*NL*
advise
you
;
explain
differences
;
show
you
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
her
thin
black
eyebrows
.
``
Is
New
York
such
a
labyrinth
?
I
*NL*
thought
it
so
straight
up
and
down
--
like
Fifth
Avenue
.
And
with
all
*NL*
the
cross
streets
numbered
!
''
She
seemed
to
guess
his
faint
disapproval
*NL*
of
this
,
and
added
,
with
the
rare
smile
that
enchanted
her
whole
face
:
*NL*
``
If
you
knew
how
I
like
it
for
just
THAT
--
the
straight-up-and-downness
,
*NL*
and
the
big
honest
labels
on
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
his
chance
.
``
Everything
may
be
labelled
--
but
everybody
is
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
I
may
simplify
too
much
--
but
you
'll
warn
me
if
I
do
.
''
She
*NL*
turned
from
the
fire
to
look
at
him
.
``
There
are
only
two
people
here
*NL*
who
make
me
feel
as
if
they
understood
what
I
mean
and
could
explain
*NL*
things
to
me
:
you
and
Mr.
Beaufort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
winced
at
the
joining
of
the
names
,
and
then
,
with
a
quick
*NL*
readjustment
,
understood
,
sympathised
and
pitied
.
So
close
to
the
*NL*
powers
of
evil
she
must
have
lived
that
she
still
breathed
more
freely
*NL*
in
their
air
.
But
since
she
felt
that
he
understood
her
also
,
his
*NL*
business
would
be
to
make
her
see
Beaufort
as
he
really
was
,
with
all
*NL*
he
represented
--
and
abhor
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
gently
:
``
I
understand
.
But
just
at
first
do
n't
let
go
of
*NL*
your
old
friends
'
hands
:
I
mean
the
older
women
,
your
Granny
Mingott
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
,
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
.
They
like
and
admire
you
--
they
want
*NL*
to
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
and
sighed
.
``
Oh
,
I
know
--
I
know
!
But
on
condition
*NL*
that
they
do
n't
hear
anything
unpleasant
.
Aunt
Welland
put
it
in
those
*NL*
very
words
when
I
tried
...
Does
no
one
want
to
know
the
truth
here
,
*NL*
Mr.
Archer
?
The
real
loneliness
is
living
among
all
these
kind
people
*NL*
who
only
ask
one
to
pretend
!
''
She
lifted
her
hands
to
her
face
,
and
he
*NL*
saw
her
thin
shoulders
shaken
by
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Olenska

Oh
,
do
n't
,
Ellen
,
''
he
cried
,
starting
up
and
bending
*NL*
over
her
.
He
drew
down
one
of
her
hands
,
clasping
and
chafing
it
like
*NL*
a
child
's
while
he
murmured
reassuring
words
;
but
in
a
moment
she
freed
*NL*
herself
,
and
looked
up
at
him
with
wet
lashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
no
one
cry
here
,
either
?
I
suppose
there
's
no
need
to
,
in
*NL*
heaven
,
''
she
said
,
straightening
her
loosened
braids
with
a
laugh
,
and
*NL*
bending
over
the
tea-kettle
.
It
was
burnt
into
his
consciousness
that
*NL*
he
had
called
her
``
Ellen
''
--
called
her
so
twice
;
and
that
she
had
not
*NL*
noticed
it
.
Far
down
the
inverted
telescope
he
saw
the
faint
white
*NL*
figure
of
May
Welland
--
in
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Nastasia
put
her
head
in
to
say
something
in
her
rich
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
,
again
with
a
hand
at
her
hair
,
uttered
an
exclamation
*NL*
of
assent
--
a
flashing
``
Gia
--
gia
''
--
and
the
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
entered
,
*NL*
piloting
a
tremendous
blackwigged
and
red-plumed
lady
in
overflowing
*NL*
furs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Countess
,
I
've
brought
an
old
friend
of
mine
to
see
you
--
Mrs.
*NL*
Struthers
.
She
was
n't
asked
to
the
party
last
night
,
and
she
wants
to
*NL*
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
beamed
on
the
group
,
and
Madame
Olenska
advanced
with
a
murmur
*NL*
of
welcome
toward
the
queer
couple
.
She
seemed
to
have
no
idea
how
*NL*
oddly
matched
they
were
,
nor
what
a
liberty
the
Duke
had
taken
in
*NL*
bringing
his
companion
--
and
to
do
him
justice
,
as
Archer
perceived
,
the
*NL*
Duke
seemed
as
unaware
of
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
want
to
know
you
,
my
dear
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Struthers
in
a
*NL*
round
rolling
voice
that
matched
her
bold
feathers
and
her
brazen
wig
.
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
everybody
who
's
young
and
interesting
and
charming
.
*NL*
And
the
Duke
tells
me
you
like
music
--
did
n't
you
,
Duke
?
You
're
a
*NL*
pianist
yourself
,
I
believe
?
Well
,
do
you
want
to
hear
Sarasate
play
*NL*
tomorrow
evening
at
my
house
?
You
know
I
've
something
going
on
every
*NL*
Sunday
evening
--
it
's
the
day
when
New
York
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
*NL*
itself
,
and
so
I
say
to
it
:
`
Come
and
be
amused
.
'
And
the
Duke
*NL*
thought
you
'd
be
tempted
by
Sarasate
.
You
'll
find
a
number
of
your
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
's
face
grew
brilliant
with
pleasure
.
``
How
kind
!
How
*NL*
good
of
the
Duke
to
think
of
me
!
''
She
pushed
a
chair
up
to
the
*NL*
tea-table
and
Mrs.
Struthers
sank
into
it
delectably
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
shall
be
too
happy
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
my
dear
.
And
bring
your
young
gentleman
with
you
.
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Struthers
extended
a
hail-fellow
hand
to
Archer
.
``
I
ca
n't
put
a
*NL*
name
to
you
--
but
I
'm
sure
I
've
met
you
--
I
've
met
everybody
,
here
,
or
in
*NL*
Paris
or
London
.
Are
n't
you
in
diplomacy
?
All
the
diplomatists
come
*NL*
to
me
.
You
like
music
too
?
Duke
,
you
must
be
sure
to
bring
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Duke
said
``
Rather
''
from
the
depths
of
his
beard
,
and
Archer
*NL*
withdrew
with
a
stiffly
circular
bow
that
made
him
feel
as
full
of
*NL*
spine
as
a
self-conscious
school-boy
among
careless
and
unnoticing
*NL*
elders
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
sorry
for
the
denouement
of
his
visit
:
he
only
wished
it
had
*NL*
come
sooner
,
and
spared
him
a
certain
waste
of
emotion
.
As
he
went
out
*NL*
into
the
wintry
night
,
New
York
again
became
vast
and
imminent
,
and
May
*NL*
Welland
the
loveliest
woman
in
it
.
He
turned
into
his
florist
's
to
*NL*
send
her
the
daily
box
of
lilies-of-the-valley
which
,
to
his
confusion
,
*NL*
he
found
he
had
forgotten
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
wrote
a
word
on
his
card
and
waited
for
an
envelope
he
glanced
*NL*
about
the
embowered
shop
,
and
his
eye
lit
on
a
cluster
of
yellow
roses
.
*NL*
He
had
never
seen
any
as
sun-golden
before
,
and
his
first
impulse
was
*NL*
to
send
them
to
May
instead
of
the
lilies
.
But
they
did
not
look
like
*NL*
her
--
there
was
something
too
rich
,
too
strong
,
in
their
fiery
beauty
.
*NL*
In
a
sudden
revulsion
of
mood
,
and
almost
without
knowing
what
he
did
,
*NL*
he
signed
to
the
florist
to
lay
the
roses
in
another
long
box
,
and
*NL*
slipped
his
card
into
a
second
envelope
,
on
which
he
wrote
the
name
of
*NL*
the
Countess
Olenska
;
then
,
just
as
he
was
turning
away
,
he
drew
the
*NL*
card
out
again
,
and
left
the
empty
envelope
on
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
go
at
once
?
''
he
enquired
,
pointing
to
the
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
florist
assured
him
that
they
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
persuaded
May
to
escape
for
a
walk
in
the
Park
after
*NL*
luncheon
.
As
was
the
custom
in
old-fashioned
Episcopalian
New
York
,
*NL*
she
usually
accompanied
her
parents
to
church
on
Sunday
afternoons
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
condoned
her
truancy
,
having
that
very
morning
won
her
*NL*
over
to
the
necessity
of
a
long
engagement
,
with
time
to
prepare
a
*NL*
hand-embroidered
trousseau
containing
the
proper
number
of
dozens
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
delectable
.
The
bare
vaulting
of
trees
along
the
Mall
was
*NL*
ceiled
with
lapis
lazuli
,
and
arched
above
snow
that
shone
like
*NL*
splintered
crystals
.
It
was
the
weather
to
call
out
May
's
radiance
,
*NL*
and
she
burned
like
a
young
maple
in
the
frost
.
Archer
was
proud
of
*NL*
the
glances
turned
on
her
,
and
the
simple
joy
of
possessorship
cleared
*NL*
away
his
underlying
perplexities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
delicious
--
waking
every
morning
to
smell
lilies-of-the-valley
*NL*
in
one
's
room
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
they
came
late
.
I
had
n't
time
in
the
morning
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
remembering
each
day
to
send
them
makes
me
love
them
so
much
*NL*
more
than
if
you
'd
given
a
standing
order
,
and
they
came
every
morning
*NL*
on
the
minute
,
like
one
's
music-teacher
--
as
I
know
Gertrude
Lefferts
's
*NL*
did
,
for
instance
,
when
she
and
Lawrence
were
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
they
would
!
''
laughed
Archer
,
amused
at
her
keenness
.
He
looked
*NL*
sideways
at
her
fruit-like
cheek
and
felt
rich
and
secure
enough
to
*NL*
add
:
``
When
I
sent
your
lilies
yesterday
afternoon
I
saw
some
rather
*NL*
gorgeous
yellow
roses
and
packed
them
off
to
Madame
Olenska
.
Was
that
*NL*
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dear
of
you
!
Anything
of
that
kind
delights
her
.
It
's
odd
she
*NL*
did
n't
mention
it
:
she
lunched
with
us
today
,
and
spoke
of
Mr.
*NL*
Beaufort
's
having
sent
her
wonderful
orchids
,
and
cousin
Henry
van
der
*NL*
Luyden
a
whole
hamper
of
carnations
from
Skuytercliff
.
She
seems
so
*NL*
surprised
to
receive
flowers
.
Do
n't
people
send
them
in
Europe
?
She
*NL*
thinks
it
such
a
pretty
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
no
wonder
mine
were
overshadowed
by
Beaufort
's
,
''
said
Archer
*NL*
irritably
.
Then
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
put
a
card
with
the
*NL*
roses
,
and
was
vexed
at
having
spoken
of
them
.
He
wanted
to
say
:
``
I
*NL*
called
on
your
cousin
yesterday
,
''
but
hesitated
.
If
Madame
Olenska
had
*NL*
not
spoken
of
his
visit
it
might
seem
awkward
that
he
should
.
Yet
not
*NL*
to
do
so
gave
the
affair
an
air
of
mystery
that
he
disliked
.
To
shake
*NL*
off
the
question
he
began
to
talk
of
their
own
plans
,
their
future
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
's
insistence
on
a
long
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
call
it
long
!
Isabel
Chivers
and
Reggie
were
engaged
for
two
*NL*
years
:
Grace
and
Thorley
for
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
.
Why
are
n't
we
*NL*
very
well
off
as
we
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
traditional
maidenly
interrogation
,
and
he
felt
ashamed
of
*NL*
himself
for
finding
it
singularly
childish
.
No
doubt
she
simply
echoed
*NL*
what
was
said
for
her
;
but
she
was
nearing
her
twenty-second
birthday
,
*NL*
and
he
wondered
at
what
age
``
nice
''
women
began
to
speak
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
if
we
wo
n't
let
them
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
mused
,
and
recalled
his
*NL*
mad
outburst
to
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
:
``
Women
ought
to
be
as
free
as
we
*NL*
are
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
presently
be
his
task
to
take
the
bandage
from
this
young
*NL*
woman
's
eyes
,
and
bid
her
look
forth
on
the
world
.
But
how
many
*NL*
generations
of
the
women
who
had
gone
to
her
making
had
descended
*NL*
bandaged
to
the
family
vault
?
He
shivered
a
little
,
remembering
some
*NL*
of
the
new
ideas
in
his
scientific
books
,
and
the
much-cited
instance
*NL*
of
the
Kentucky
cave-fish
,
which
had
ceased
to
develop
eyes
because
*NL*
they
had
no
use
for
them
.
What
if
,
when
he
had
bidden
May
Welland
to
*NL*
open
hers
,
they
could
only
look
out
blankly
at
blankness
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
be
much
better
off
.
We
might
be
altogether
together
--
we
*NL*
might
travel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
lit
up
.
``
That
would
be
lovely
,
''
she
owned
:
she
would
love
to
*NL*
travel
.
But
her
mother
would
not
understand
their
wanting
to
do
things
*NL*
so
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
the
mere
`
differently
'
did
n't
account
for
it
!
''
the
wooer
*NL*
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
!
You
're
so
original
!
''
she
exulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
sank
,
for
he
saw
that
he
was
saying
all
the
things
that
young
*NL*
men
in
the
same
situation
were
expected
to
say
,
and
that
she
was
making
*NL*
the
answers
that
instinct
and
tradition
taught
her
to
make
--
even
to
the
*NL*
point
of
calling
him
original
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Original
!
We
're
all
as
like
each
other
as
those
dolls
cut
out
of
the
*NL*
same
folded
paper
.
We
're
like
patterns
stencilled
on
a
wall
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
you
and
I
strike
out
for
ourselves
,
May
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stopped
and
faced
her
in
the
excitement
of
their
discussion
,
and
*NL*
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
a
bright
unclouded
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
--
shall
we
elope
?
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
DO
love
me
,
Newland
!
I
'm
so
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
--
why
not
be
happier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
behave
like
people
in
novels
,
though
,
can
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
--
why
not
--
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
a
little
bored
by
his
insistence
.
She
knew
very
well
that
*NL*
they
could
n't
,
but
it
was
troublesome
to
have
to
produce
a
reason
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
clever
enough
to
argue
with
you
.
But
that
kind
of
thing
is
*NL*
rather
--
vulgar
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
suggested
,
relieved
to
have
hit
on
a
*NL*
word
that
would
assuredly
extinguish
the
whole
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
so
much
afraid
,
then
,
of
being
vulgar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
evidently
staggered
by
this
.
``
Of
course
I
should
hate
it
--
so
*NL*
would
you
,
''
she
rejoined
,
a
trifle
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
silent
,
beating
his
stick
nervously
against
his
boot-top
;
and
*NL*
feeling
that
she
had
indeed
found
the
right
way
of
closing
the
*NL*
discussion
,
she
went
on
light-heartedly
:
``
Oh
,
did
I
tell
you
that
I
*NL*
showed
Ellen
my
ring
?
She
thinks
it
the
most
beautiful
setting
she
*NL*
ever
saw
.
There
's
nothing
like
it
in
the
rue
de
la
Paix
,
she
said
.
I
*NL*
do
love
you
,
Newland
,
for
being
so
artistic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
afternoon
,
as
Archer
,
before
dinner
,
sat
smoking
sullenly
in
*NL*
his
study
,
Janey
wandered
in
on
him
.
He
had
failed
to
stop
at
his
club
*NL*
on
the
way
up
from
the
office
where
he
exercised
the
profession
of
the
*NL*
law
in
the
leisurely
manner
common
to
well-to-do
New
Yorkers
of
his
*NL*
class
.
He
was
out
of
spirits
and
slightly
out
of
temper
,
and
a
*NL*
haunting
horror
of
doing
the
same
thing
every
day
at
the
same
hour
*NL*
besieged
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sameness
--
sameness
!
''
he
muttered
,
the
word
running
through
his
head
*NL*
like
a
persecuting
tune
as
he
saw
the
familiar
tall-hatted
figures
*NL*
lounging
behind
the
plate-glass
;
and
because
he
usually
dropped
in
at
*NL*
the
club
at
that
hour
he
had
gone
home
instead
.
He
knew
not
only
what
*NL*
they
were
likely
to
be
talking
about
,
but
the
part
each
one
would
take
*NL*
in
the
discussion
.
The
Duke
of
course
would
be
their
principal
theme
;
*NL*
though
the
appearance
in
Fifth
Avenue
of
a
golden-haired
lady
in
a
*NL*
small
canary-coloured
brougham
with
a
pair

for
which
*NL*
Beaufort
was
generally
thought
responsible
-RRB-
would
also
doubtless
be
*NL*
thoroughly
gone
into

Such
``
women
''
-LRB-
as
they
were
called
-RRB-
were
few
in
*NL*
New
York
,
those
driving
their
own
carriages
still
fewer
,
and
the
*NL*
appearance
of
Miss
Fanny
Ring
in
Fifth
Avenue
at
the
fashionable
hour
*NL*
had
profoundly
agitated
society
.
Only
the
day
before
,
her
carriage
had
*NL*
passed
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
's
,
and
the
latter
had
instantly
rung
the
*NL*
little
bell
at
her
elbow
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
her
home
.
*NL*
``
What
if
it
had
happened
to
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden

''
people
asked
each
*NL*
other
with
a
shudder
.
Archer
could
hear
Lawrence
Lefferts
,
at
that
*NL*
very
hour
,
holding
forth
on
the
disintegration
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
head
irritably
when
his
sister
Janey
entered
,
and
then
*NL*
quickly
bent
over
his
book
-LRB-
Swinburne
's
``
Chastelard
''
--
just
out
-RRB-
as
if
*NL*
he
had
not
seen
her
.
She
glanced
at
the
writing-table
heaped
with
*NL*
books
,
opened
a
volume
of
the
``
Contes
Drolatiques
,
''
made
a
wry
face
*NL*
over
the
archaic
French
,
and
sighed
:
``
What
learned
things

read

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
asked
,
as
she
hovered
Cassandra-like
before
him

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Miss
Sophy
Jackson

She
brought

:
she
could
n't

very
much

forbade

went
there
with

*NL*
At
the
last
clause
of
this
announcement
a
senseless
anger
swelled
the
*NL*
young
man
's
breast
.
To
smother
it
he
laughed

laughed
again

had

Mr.

figure
loomed
on

went
forward

greet
his
cousin

*NL*
``
We

said

Mr.

seemed
overwhelmed

He
drew
off
*NL*
his
glove
to
shake
hands
with
the
ladies

and
smoothed
his
tall
hat

shyly

pushed
an

forward

complacency
restored

He
sank
into

chair

laid
*NL*
his
hat

gloves
on
the
floor
beside
him
in
the
old-fashioned
way

went
on
:
``

I
was
astonished

Instead

A
dead
silence
greeted
this
unusual
flow

Mrs.

drew
her
embroidery
out

nervously
tumbled
it

Newland

leaning
against
the

chimney-place

twisting
a
humming-bird-feather
screen
in
his

saw

up

coming

down

great
signet-ring

to
give
her
a
friendly
warning
about
allowing

it
became

dutifully
reflected

closed
behind
their
visitor
a
silence
*NL*
fell
upon
the
Archer
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
--
how
romantic
!
''
at
last
broke
explosively
from
Janey
.
No
one
*NL*
knew
exactly
what
inspired
her
elliptic
comments
,
and
her
relations
had
*NL*
long
since
given
up
trying
to
interpret
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
shook
her
head
with
a
sigh
.
``
Provided
it
all
turns
out
for
*NL*
the
best
,
''
she
said
,
in
the
tone
of
one
who
knows
how
surely
it
will
*NL*
not
.
``
Newland
,
you
must
stay
and
see
Sillerton
Jackson
when
he
comes
*NL*
this
evening
:
I
really
sha
n't
know
what
to
say
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
mother
!
But
he
wo
n't
come
--
''
her
son
laughed
,
stooping
to
kiss
*NL*
away
her
frown
.
*NL*

*NL*

Some
two
weeks
later
,
Newland
Archer
,
sitting
in
abstracted
idleness
in
*NL*
his
private
compartment
of
the
office
of
Letterblair
,
Lamson
and
Low
,
*NL*
attorneys
at
law
,
was
summoned
by
the
head
of
the
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Letterblair
,
the
accredited
legal
adviser
of
three
generations
*NL*
of
New
York
gentility
,
throned
behind
his
mahogany
desk
in
evident
*NL*
perplexity
.
As
he
stroked
his
closeclipped
white
whiskers
and
ran
his
*NL*
hand
through
the
rumpled
grey
locks
above
his
jutting
brows
,
his
*NL*
disrespectful
junior
partner
thought
how
much
he
looked
like
the
Family
*NL*
Physician
annoyed
with
a
patient
whose
symptoms
refuse
to
be
classified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
--
''
he
always
addressed
Archer
as
``
sir
''
--
``
I
have
sent
for
*NL*
you
to
go
into
a
little
matter
;
a
matter
which
,
for
the
moment
,
I
*NL*
prefer
not
to
mention
either
to
Mr.
Skipworth
or
Mr.
Redwood
.
''
The
*NL*
gentlemen
he
spoke
of
were
the
other
senior
partners
of
the
firm
;
for
,
*NL*
as
was
always
the
case
with
legal
associations
of
old
standing
in
New
*NL*
York
,
all
the
partners
named
on
the
office
letter-head
were
long
since
*NL*
dead
;
and
Mr.
Letterblair
,
for
example
,
was
,
professionally
speaking
,
*NL*
his
own
grandson
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
furrowed
brow
.
``
For
family
*NL*
reasons
--
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Mingott
family
,
''
said
Mr.
Letterblair
with
an
explanatory
smile
*NL*
and
bow
.
``
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
sent
for
me
yesterday
.
Her
*NL*
grand-daughter
the
Countess
Olenska
wishes
to
sue
her
husband
for
*NL*
divorce
.
Certain
papers
have
been
placed
in
my
hands
.
''
He
paused
and
*NL*
drummed
on
his
desk
.
``
In
view
of
your
prospective
alliance
with
the
*NL*
family
I
should
like
to
consult
you
--
to
consider
the
case
with
*NL*
you
--
before
taking
any
farther
steps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
the
blood
in
his
temples
.
He
had
seen
the
Countess
Olenska
*NL*
only
once
since
his
visit
to
her
,
and
then
at
the
Opera
,
in
the
Mingott
*NL*
box
.
During
this
interval
she
had
become
a
less
vivid
and
importunate
*NL*
image
,
receding
from
his
foreground
as
May
Welland
resumed
her
rightful
*NL*
place
in
it
.
He
had
not
heard
her
divorce
spoken
of
since
Janey
's
*NL*
first
random
allusion
to
it
,
and
had
dismissed
the
tale
as
unfounded
*NL*
gossip
.
Theoretically
,
the
idea
of
divorce
was
almost
as
distasteful
*NL*
to
him
as
to
his
mother
;
and
he
was
annoyed
that
Mr.
Letterblair
-LRB-
no
*NL*
doubt
prompted
by
old
Catherine
Mingott
-RRB-
should
be
so
evidently
*NL*
planning
to
draw
him
into
the
affair
.
After
all
,
there
were
plenty
of
*NL*
Mingott
men
for
such
jobs
,
and
as
yet
he
was
not
even
a
Mingott
by
*NL*
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
for
the
senior
partner
to
continue
.
Mr.
Letterblair
unlocked
*NL*
a
drawer
and
drew
out
a
packet
.
``
If
you
will
run
your
eye
over
these
*NL*
papers
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
frowned
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
;
but
just
because
of
the
*NL*
prospective
relationship
,
I
should
prefer
your
consulting
Mr.
Skipworth
*NL*
or
Mr.
Redwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
looked
surprised
and
slightly
offended
.
It
was
unusual
*NL*
for
a
junior
to
reject
such
an
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
.
``
I
respect
your
scruple
,
sir
;
but
in
this
case
I
believe
*NL*
true
delicacy
requires
you
to
do
as
I
ask
.
Indeed
,
the
suggestion
is
*NL*
not
mine
but
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
and
her
son
's
.
I
have
seen
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
;
and
also
Mr.
Welland
.
They
all
named
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
his
temper
rising
.
He
had
been
somewhat
languidly
drifting
*NL*
with
events
for
the
last
fortnight
,
and
letting
May
's
fair
looks
and
*NL*
radiant
nature
obliterate
the
rather
importunate
pressure
of
the
*NL*
Mingott
claims
.
But
this
behest
of
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
roused
him
to
a
*NL*
sense
of
what
the
clan
thought
they
had
the
right
to
exact
from
a
*NL*
prospective
son-in-law
;
and
he
chafed
at
the
role
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
uncles
ought
to
deal
with
this
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
.
The
matter
has
been
gone
into
by
the
family
.
They
are
*NL*
opposed
to
the
Countess
's
idea
;
but
she
is
firm
,
and
insists
on
a
legal
*NL*
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
was
silent
:
he
had
not
opened
the
packet
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
want
to
marry
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
is
suggested
;
but
she
denies
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
oblige
me
,
Mr.
Archer
,
by
first
looking
through
these
papers
?
*NL*
Afterward
,
when
we
have
talked
the
case
over
,
I
will
give
you
my
*NL*
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
withdrew
reluctantly
with
the
unwelcome
documents
.
Since
their
*NL*
last
meeting
he
had
half-unconsciously
collaborated
with
events
in
*NL*
ridding
himself
of
the
burden
of
Madame
Olenska
.
His
hour
alone
with
*NL*
her
by
the
firelight
had
drawn
them
into
a
momentary
intimacy
on
which
*NL*
the
Duke
of
St.
Austrey
's
intrusion
with
Mrs.
Lemuel
Struthers
,
and
the
*NL*
Countess
's
joyous
greeting
of
them
,
had
rather
providentially
broken
.
*NL*
Two
days
later
Archer
had
assisted
at
the
comedy
of
her
reinstatement
*NL*
in
the
van
der
Luydens
'
favour
,
and
had
said
to
himself
,
with
a
touch
*NL*
of
tartness
,
that
a
lady
who
knew
how
to
thank
all-powerful
elderly
*NL*
gentlemen
to
such
good
purpose
for
a
bunch
of
flowers
did
not
need
*NL*
either
the
private
consolations
or
the
public
championship
of
a
young
*NL*
man
of
his
small
compass
.
To
look
at
the
matter
in
this
light
*NL*
simplified
his
own
case
and
surprisingly
furbished
up
all
the
dim
*NL*
domestic
virtues
.
He
could
not
picture
May
Welland
,
in
whatever
*NL*
conceivable
emergency
,
hawking
about
her
private
difficulties
and
*NL*
lavishing
her
confidences
on
strange
men
;
and
she
had
never
seemed
to
*NL*
him
finer
or
fairer
than
in
the
week
that
followed
.
He
had
even
*NL*
yielded
to
her
wish
for
a
long
engagement
,
since
she
had
found
the
one
*NL*
disarming
answer
to
his
plea
for
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
when
it
comes
to
the
point
,
your
parents
have
always
let
you
*NL*
have
your
way
ever
since
you
were
a
little
girl
,
''
he
argued
;
and
she
*NL*
had
answered
,
with
her
clearest
look
:
``
Yes
;
and
that
's
what
makes
it
*NL*
so
hard
to
refuse
the
very
last
thing
they
'll
ever
ask
of
me
as
a
*NL*
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
old
New
York
note
;
that
was
the
kind
of
answer
he
would
*NL*
like
always
to
be
sure
of
his
wife
's
making
.
If
one
had
habitually
*NL*
breathed
the
New
York
air
there
were
times
when
anything
less
*NL*
crystalline
seemed
stifling
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
papers
he
had
retired
to
read
did
not
tell
him
much
in
fact
;
but
*NL*
they
plunged
him
into
an
atmosphere
in
which
he
choked
and
spluttered
.
*NL*
They
consisted
mainly
of
an
exchange
of
letters
between
Count
Olenski
's
*NL*
solicitors
and
a
French
legal
firm
to
whom
the
Countess
had
applied
for
*NL*
the
settlement
of
her
financial
situation
.
There
was
also
a
short
*NL*
letter
from
the
Count
to
his
wife
:
after
reading
it
,
Newland
Archer
*NL*
rose
,
jammed
the
papers
back
into
their
envelope
,
and
reentered
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
's
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
the
letters
,
sir
.
If
you
wish
,
I
'll
see
Madame
Olenska
,
''
he
*NL*
said
in
a
constrained
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
--
thank
you
,
Mr.
Archer
.
Come
and
dine
with
me
tonight
if
*NL*
you
're
free
,
and
we
'll
go
into
the
matter
afterward
:
in
case
you
wish
*NL*
to
call
on
our
client
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
walked
straight
home
again
that
afternoon
.
It
was
a
*NL*
winter
evening
of
transparent
clearness
,
with
an
innocent
young
moon
*NL*
above
the
house-tops
;
and
he
wanted
to
fill
his
soul
's
lungs
with
the
*NL*
pure
radiance
,
and
not
exchange
a
word
with
any
one
till
he
and
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
were
closeted
together
after
dinner
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
decide
otherwise
than
he
had
done
:
he
must
see
Madame
Olenska
himself
*NL*
rather
than
let
her
secrets
be
bared
to
other
eyes
.
A
great
wave
of
*NL*
compassion
had
swept
away
his
indifference
and
impatience
:
she
stood
*NL*
before
him
as
an
exposed
and
pitiful
figure
,
to
be
saved
at
all
costs
*NL*
from
farther
wounding
herself
in
her
mad
plunges
against
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
what
she
had
told
him
of
Mrs.
Welland
's
request
to
be
*NL*
spared
whatever
was
``
unpleasant
''
in
her
history
,
and
winced
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
it
was
perhaps
this
attitude
of
mind
which
kept
the
New
*NL*
York
air
so
pure
.
``
Are
we
only
Pharisees
after
all
?
''
he
wondered
,
*NL*
puzzled
by
the
effort
to
reconcile
his
instinctive
disgust
at
human
*NL*
vileness
with
his
equally
instinctive
pity
for
human
frailty
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
he
perceived
how
elementary
his
own
principles
had
*NL*
always
been
.
He
passed
for
a
young
man
who
had
not
been
afraid
of
*NL*
risks
,
and
he
knew
that
his
secret
love-affair
with
poor
silly
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorley
Rushworth
had
not
been
too
secret
to
invest
him
with
a
becoming
*NL*
air
of
adventure
.
But
Mrs.
Rushworth
was
``
that
kind
of
woman
''
;
*NL*
foolish
,
vain
,
clandestine
by
nature
,
and
far
more
attracted
by
the
*NL*
secrecy
and
peril
of
the
affair
than
by
such
charms
and
qualities
as
he
*NL*
possessed
.
When
the
fact
dawned
on
him
it
nearly
broke
his
heart
,
but
*NL*
now
it
seemed
the
redeeming
feature
of
the
case
.
The
affair
,
in
short
,
*NL*
had
been
of
the
kind
that
most
of
the
young
men
of
his
age
had
been
*NL*
through
,
and
emerged
from
with
calm
consciences
and
an
undisturbed
*NL*
belief
in
the
abysmal
distinction
between
the
women
one
loved
and
*NL*
respected
and
those
one
enjoyed
--
and
pitied
.
In
this
view
they
were
*NL*
sedulously
abetted
by
their
mothers
,
aunts
and
other
elderly
female
*NL*
relatives
,
who
all
shared
Mrs.
Archer
's
belief
that
when
``
such
things
*NL*
happened
''
it
was
undoubtedly
foolish
of
the
man
,
but
somehow
always
*NL*
criminal
of
the
woman
.
All
the
elderly
ladies
whom
Archer
knew
*NL*
regarded
any
woman
who
loved
imprudently
as
necessarily
unscrupulous
*NL*
and
designing
,
and
mere
simple-minded
man
as
powerless
in
her
clutches
.
*NL*
The
only
thing
to
do
was
to
persuade
him
,
as
early
as
possible
,
to
*NL*
marry
a
nice
girl
,
and
then
trust
to
her
to
look
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
complicated
old
European
communities
,
Archer
began
to
guess
,
*NL*
love-problems
might
be
less
simple
and
less
easily
classified
.
Rich
*NL*
and
idle
and
ornamental
societies
must
produce
many
more
such
*NL*
situations
;
and
there
might
even
be
one
in
which
a
woman
naturally
*NL*
sensitive
and
aloof
would
yet
,
from
the
force
of
circumstances
,
from
*NL*
sheer
defencelessness
and
loneliness
,
be
drawn
into
a
tie
inexcusable
*NL*
by
conventional
standards
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
he
wrote
a
line
to
the
Countess
Olenska
,
asking
at
*NL*
what
hour
of
the
next
day
she
could
receive
him
,
and
despatched
it
by
a
*NL*
messenger-boy
,
who
returned
presently
with
a
word
to
the
effect
that
*NL*
she
was
going
to
Skuytercliff
the
next
morning
to
stay
over
Sunday
with
*NL*
the
van
der
Luydens
,
but
that
he
would
find
her
alone
that
evening
*NL*
after
dinner
.
The
note
was
written
on
a
rather
untidy
half-sheet
,
*NL*
without
date
or
address
,
but
her
hand
was
firm
and
free
.
He
was
amused
*NL*
at
the
idea
of
her
week-ending
in
the
stately
solitude
of
Skuytercliff
,
*NL*
but
immediately
afterward
felt
that
there
,
of
all
places
,
she
would
*NL*
most
feel
the
chill
of
minds
rigorously
averted
from
the
``
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
at
Mr.
Letterblair
's
punctually
at
seven
,
glad
of
the
pretext
*NL*
for
excusing
himself
soon
after
dinner
.
He
had
formed
his
own
opinion
*NL*
from
the
papers
entrusted
to
him
,
and
did
not
especially
want
to
go
*NL*
into
the
matter
with
his
senior
partner
.
Mr.
Letterblair
was
a
*NL*
widower
,
and
they
dined
alone
,
copiously
and
slowly
,
in
a
dark
shabby
*NL*
room
hung
with
yellowing
prints
of
``
The
Death
of
Chatham
''
and
``
The
*NL*
Coronation
of
Napoleon
.
''
On
the
sideboard
,
between
fluted
Sheraton
*NL*
knife-cases
,
stood
a
decanter
of
Haut
Brion
,
and
another
of
the
old
*NL*
Lanning
port
-LRB-
the
gift
of
a
client
-RRB-
,
which
the
wastrel
Tom
Lanning
had
*NL*
sold
off
a
year
or
two
before
his
mysterious
and
discreditable
death
in
*NL*
San
Francisco
--
an
incident
less
publicly
humiliating
to
the
family
than
*NL*
the
sale
of
the
cellar
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
velvety
oyster
soup
came
shad
and
cucumbers
,
then
a
young
*NL*
broiled
turkey
with
corn
fritters
,
followed
by
a
canvas-back
with
*NL*
currant
jelly
and
a
celery
mayonnaise
.
Mr.
Letterblair
,
who
lunched
on
*NL*
a
sandwich
and
tea
,
dined
deliberately
and
deeply
,
and
insisted
on
his
*NL*
guest
's
doing
the
same
.
Finally
,
when
the
closing
rites
had
been
*NL*
accomplished
,
the
cloth
was
removed
,
cigars
were
lit
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
pushing
the
port
westward
,
*NL*
said
,
spreading
his
back
agreeably
to
the
coal
fire
behind
him
:
``
The
*NL*
whole
family
are
against
a
divorce
.
And
I
think
rightly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
instantly
felt
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
argument
.
``
But
*NL*
why
,
sir
?
If
there
ever
was
a
case
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
's
the
use
?
SHE
'S
here
--
he
's
there
;
the
Atlantic
's
between
*NL*
them
.
She
'll
never
get
back
a
dollar
more
of
her
money
than
what
he
's
*NL*
voluntarily
returned
to
her
:
their
damned
heathen
marriage
settlements
*NL*
take
precious
good
care
of
that
.
As
things
go
over
there
,
Olenski
's
*NL*
acted
generously
:
he
might
have
turned
her
out
without
a
penny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
knew
this
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
though
,
''
Mr.
Letterblair
continued
,
``
that
she
attaches
*NL*
no
importance
to
the
money
.
Therefore
,
as
the
family
say
,
why
not
let
*NL*
well
enough
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
gone
to
the
house
an
hour
earlier
in
full
agreement
with
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
's
view
;
but
put
into
words
by
this
selfish
,
well-fed
and
*NL*
supremely
indifferent
old
man
it
suddenly
became
the
Pharisaic
voice
of
*NL*
a
society
wholly
absorbed
in
barricading
itself
against
the
unpleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
's
for
her
to
decide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
have
you
considered
the
consequences
if
she
decides
for
divorce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
threat
in
her
husband
's
letter
?
What
weight
would
that
*NL*
carry
?
It
's
no
more
than
the
vague
charge
of
an
angry
blackguard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
it
might
make
some
unpleasant
talk
if
he
really
defends
the
*NL*
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unpleasant
--
!
''
said
Archer
explosively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
looked
at
him
from
under
enquiring
eyebrows
,
and
the
*NL*
young
man
,
aware
of
the
uselessness
of
trying
to
explain
what
was
in
*NL*
his
mind
,
bowed
acquiescently
while
his
senior
continued
:
``
Divorce
is
*NL*
always
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
agree
with
me
?
''
Mr.
Letterblair
resumed
,
after
a
waiting
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
''
said
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
may
count
on
you
;
the
Mingotts
may
count
on
you
;
to
use
*NL*
your
influence
against
the
idea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
hesitated
.
``
I
ca
n't
pledge
myself
till
I
've
seen
the
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
,
''
he
said
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Archer
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
.
Do
you
want
to
marry
into
a
*NL*
family
with
a
scandalous
divorce-suit
hanging
over
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
put
down
his
glass
of
port
and
fixed
on
his
young
*NL*
partner
a
cautious
and
apprehensive
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
understood
that
he
ran
the
risk
of
having
his
mandate
withdrawn
,
*NL*
and
for
some
obscure
reason
he
disliked
the
prospect
.
Now
that
the
job
*NL*
had
been
thrust
on
him
he
did
not
propose
to
relinquish
it
;
and
,
to
*NL*
guard
against
the
possibility
,
he
saw
that
he
must
reassure
the
*NL*
unimaginative
old
man
who
was
the
legal
conscience
of
the
Mingotts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
,
sir
,
that
I
sha
n't
commit
myself
till
I
've
reported
*NL*
to
you
;
what
I
meant
was
that
I
'd
rather
not
give
an
opinion
till
I
've
*NL*
heard
what
Madame
Olenska
has
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
nodded
approvingly
at
an
excess
of
caution
worthy
of
*NL*
the
best
New
York
tradition
,
and
the
young
man
,
glancing
at
his
watch
,
*NL*
pleaded
an
engagement
and
took
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old-fashioned
New
York
dined
at
seven
,
and
the
habit
of
after-dinner
*NL*
calls
,
though
derided
in
Archer
's
set
,
still
generally
prevailed
.
As
*NL*
the
young
man
strolled
up
Fifth
Avenue
from
Waverley
Place
,
the
long
*NL*
thoroughfare
was
deserted
but
for
a
group
of
carriages
standing
before
*NL*
the
Reggie
Chiverses
'
-LRB-
where
there
was
a
dinner
for
the
Duke
-RRB-
,
and
the
*NL*
occasional
figure
of
an
elderly
gentleman
in
heavy
overcoat
and
muffler
*NL*
ascending
a
brownstone
doorstep
and
disappearing
into
a
gas-lit
hall
.
*NL*
Thus
,
as
Archer
crossed
Washington
Square
,
he
remarked
that
old
Mr.
du
*NL*
Lac
was
calling
on
his
cousins
the
Dagonets
,
and
turning
down
the
*NL*
corner
of
West
Tenth
Street
he
saw
Mr.
Skipworth
,
of
his
own
firm
,
*NL*
obviously
bound
on
a
visit
to
the
Miss
Lannings
.
A
little
farther
up
*NL*
Fifth
Avenue
,
Beaufort
appeared
on
his
doorstep
,
darkly
projected
*NL*
against
a
blaze
of
light
,
descended
to
his
private
brougham
,
and
rolled
*NL*
away
to
a
mysterious
and
probably
unmentionable
destination
.
It
was
*NL*
not
an
Opera
night
,
and
no
one
was
giving
a
party
,
so
that
Beaufort
's
*NL*
outing
was
undoubtedly
of
a
clandestine
nature
.
Archer
connected
it
in
*NL*
his
mind
with
a
little
house
beyond
Lexington
Avenue
in
which
*NL*
beribboned
window
curtains
and
flower-boxes
had
recently
appeared
,
and
*NL*
before
whose
newly
painted
door
the
canary-coloured
brougham
of
Miss
*NL*
Fanny
Ring
was
frequently
seen
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
small
and
slippery
pyramid
which
composed
Mrs.
Archer
's
*NL*
world
lay
the
almost
unmapped
quarter
inhabited
by
artists
,
musicians
*NL*
and
``
people
who
wrote
.
''
These
scattered
fragments
of
humanity
had
*NL*
never
shown
any
desire
to
be
amalgamated
with
the
social
structure
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
odd
ways
they
were
said
to
be
,
for
the
most
part
,
quite
*NL*
respectable
;
but
they
preferred
to
keep
to
themselves
.
Medora
Manson
,
*NL*
in
her
prosperous
days
,
had
inaugurated
a
``
literary
salon
''
;
but
it
had
*NL*
soon
died
out
owing
to
the
reluctance
of
the
literary
to
frequent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
had
made
the
same
attempt
,
and
there
was
a
household
of
*NL*
Blenkers
--
an
intense
and
voluble
mother
,
and
three
blowsy
daughters
who
*NL*
imitated
her
--
where
one
met
Edwin
Booth
and
Patti
and
William
Winter
,
*NL*
and
the
new
Shakespearian
actor
George
Rignold
,
and
some
of
the
*NL*
magazine
editors
and
musical
and
literary
critics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
and
her
group
felt
a
certain
timidity
concerning
these
*NL*
persons
.
They
were
odd
,
they
were
uncertain
,
they
had
things
one
*NL*
did
n't
know
about
in
the
background
of
their
lives
and
minds
.
*NL*
Literature
and
art
were
deeply
respected
in
the
Archer
set
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
was
always
at
pains
to
tell
her
children
how
much
more
agreeable
*NL*
and
cultivated
society
had
been
when
it
included
such
figures
as
*NL*
Washington
Irving
,
Fitz-Greene
Halleck
and
the
poet
of
``
The
Culprit
*NL*
Fay
.
''
The
most
celebrated
authors
of
that
generation
had
been
*NL*
``
gentlemen
''
;
perhaps
the
unknown
persons
who
succeeded
them
had
*NL*
gentlemanly
sentiments
,
but
their
origin
,
their
appearance
,
their
hair
,
*NL*
their
intimacy
with
the
stage
and
the
Opera
,
made
any
old
New
York
*NL*
criterion
inapplicable
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
a
girl
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
used
to
say
,
``
we
knew
everybody
*NL*
between
the
Battery
and
Canal
Street
;
and
only
the
people
one
knew
had
*NL*
carriages
.
It
was
perfectly
easy
to
place
any
one
then
;
now
one
ca
n't
*NL*
tell
,
and
I
prefer
not
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
old
Catherine
Mingott
,
with
her
absence
of
moral
prejudices
and
*NL*
almost
parvenu
indifference
to
the
subtler
distinctions
,
might
have
*NL*
bridged
the
abyss
;
but
she
had
never
opened
a
book
or
looked
at
a
*NL*
picture
,
and
cared
for
music
only
because
it
reminded
her
of
gala
*NL*
nights
at
the
Italiens
,
in
the
days
of
her
triumph
at
the
Tuileries
.
*NL*
Possibly
Beaufort
,
who
was
her
match
in
daring
,
would
have
succeeded
in
*NL*
bringing
about
a
fusion
;
but
his
grand
house
and
silk-stockinged
*NL*
footmen
were
an
obstacle
to
informal
sociability
.
Moreover
,
he
was
as
*NL*
illiterate
as
old
Mrs.
Mingott
,
and
considered
``
fellows
who
wrote
''
as
*NL*
the
mere
paid
purveyors
of
rich
men
's
pleasures
;
and
no
one
rich
enough
*NL*
to
influence
his
opinion
had
ever
questioned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
had
been
aware
of
these
things
ever
since
he
could
*NL*
remember
,
and
had
accepted
them
as
part
of
the
structure
of
his
*NL*
universe
.
He
knew
that
there
were
societies
where
painters
and
poets
*NL*
and
novelists
and
men
of
science
,
and
even
great
actors
,
were
as
sought
*NL*
after
as
Dukes
;
he
had
often
pictured
to
himself
what
it
would
have
*NL*
been
to
live
in
the
intimacy
of
drawing-rooms
dominated
by
the
talk
of
*NL*
Merimee
-LRB-
whose
``
Lettres
a
une
Inconnue
''
was
one
of
his
inseparables
-RRB-
,
*NL*
of
Thackeray
,
Browning
or
William
Morris
.
But
such
things
were
*NL*
inconceivable
in
New
York
,
and
unsettling
to
think
of
.
Archer
knew
*NL*
most
of
the
``
fellows
who
wrote
,
''
the
musicians
and
the
painters
:
he
met
*NL*
them
at
the
Century
,
or
at
the
little
musical
and
theatrical
clubs
that
*NL*
were
beginning
to
come
into
existence
.
He
enjoyed
them
there
,
and
was
*NL*
bored
with
them
at
the
Blenkers
'
,
where
they
were
mingled
with
fervid
*NL*
and
dowdy
women
who
passed
them
about
like
captured
curiosities
;
and
*NL*
even
after
his
most
exciting
talks
with
Ned
Winsett
he
always
came
away
*NL*
with
the
feeling
that
if
his
world
was
small
,
so
was
theirs
,
and
that
*NL*
the
only
way
to
enlarge
either
was
to
reach
a
stage
of
manners
where
*NL*
they
would
naturally
merge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
reminded
of
this
by
trying
to
picture
the
society
in
which
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
had
lived
and
suffered
,
and
also
--
perhaps
--
tasted
*NL*
mysterious
joys
.
He
remembered
with
what
amusement
she
had
told
him
*NL*
that
her
grandmother
Mingott
and
the
Wellands
objected
to
her
living
in
*NL*
a
``
Bohemian
''
quarter
given
over
to
``
people
who
wrote
.
''
It
was
not
the
*NL*
peril
but
the
poverty
that
her
family
disliked
;
but
that
shade
escaped
*NL*
her
,
and
she
supposed
they
considered
literature
compromising
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
herself
had
no
fears
of
it
,
and
the
books
scattered
about
her
*NL*
drawing-room
-LRB-
a
part
of
the
house
in
which
books
were
usually
supposed
*NL*
to
be
``
out
of
place
''
-RRB-
,
though
chiefly
works
of
fiction
,
had
whetted
*NL*
Archer
's
interest
with
such
new
names
as
those
of
Paul
Bourget
,
*NL*
Huysmans
,
and
the
Goncourt
brothers
.
Ruminating
on
these
things
as
he
*NL*
approached
her
door
,
he
was
once
more
conscious
of
the
curious
way
in
*NL*
which
she
reversed
his
values
,
and
of
the
need
of
thinking
himself
into
*NL*
conditions
incredibly
different
from
any
that
he
knew
if
he
were
to
be
*NL*
of
use
in
her
present
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nastasia
opened
the
door
,
smiling
mysteriously
.
On
the
bench
in
the
*NL*
hall
lay
a
sable-lined
overcoat
,
a
folded
opera
hat
of
dull
silk
with
a
*NL*
gold
J.
B.
on
the
lining
,
and
a
white
silk
muffler
:
there
was
no
*NL*
mistaking
the
fact
that
these
costly
articles
were
the
property
of
*NL*
Julius
Beaufort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
angry
:
so
angry
that
he
came
near
scribbling
a
word
on
his
*NL*
card
and
going
away
;
then
he
remembered
that
in
writing
to
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
he
had
been
kept
by
excess
of
discretion
from
saying
that
he
*NL*
wished
to
see
her
privately
.
He
had
therefore
no
one
but
himself
to
*NL*
blame
if
she
had
opened
her
doors
to
other
visitors
;
and
he
entered
the
*NL*
drawing-room
with
the
dogged
determination
to
make
Beaufort
feel
*NL*
himself
in
the
way
,
and
to
outstay
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banker
stood
leaning
against
the
mantelshelf
,
which
was
draped
with
*NL*
an
old
embroidery
held
in
place
by
brass
candelabra
containing
church
*NL*
candles
of
yellowish
wax
.
He
had
thrust
his
chest
out
,
supporting
his
*NL*
shoulders
against
the
mantel
and
resting
his
weight
on
one
large
*NL*
patent-leather
foot
.
As
Archer
entered
he
was
smiling
and
looking
down
*NL*
on
his
hostess
,
who
sat
on
a
sofa
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
*NL*
chimney
.
A
table
banked
with
flowers
formed
a
screen
behind
it
,
and
*NL*
against
the
orchids
and
azaleas
which
the
young
man
recognised
as
*NL*
tributes
from
the
Beaufort
hot-houses
,
Madame
Olenska
sat
*NL*
half-reclined
,
her
head
propped
on
a
hand
and
her
wide
sleeve
leaving
*NL*
the
arm
bare
to
the
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
usual
for
ladies
who
received
in
the
evenings
to
wear
what
were
*NL*
called
``
simple
dinner
dresses
''
:
a
close-fitting
armour
of
whale-boned
*NL*
silk
,
slightly
open
in
the
neck
,
with
lace
ruffles
filling
in
the
*NL*
crack
,
and
tight
sleeves
with
a
flounce
uncovering
just
enough
wrist
to
*NL*
show
an
Etruscan
gold
bracelet
or
a
velvet
band
.
But
Madame
Olenska
,
*NL*
heedless
of
tradition
,
was
attired
in
a
long
robe
of
red
velvet
*NL*
bordered
about
the
chin
and
down
the
front
with
glossy
black
fur
.
*NL*
Archer
remembered
,
on
his
last
visit
to
Paris
,
seeing
a
portrait
by
the
*NL*
new
painter
,
Carolus
Duran
,
whose
pictures
were
the
sensation
of
the
*NL*
Salon
,
in
which
the
lady
wore
one
of
these
bold
sheath-like
robes
with
*NL*
her
chin
nestling
in
fur
.
There
was
something
perverse
and
provocative
*NL*
in
the
notion
of
fur
worn
in
the
evening
in
a
heated
drawing-room
,
and
*NL*
in
the
combination
of
a
muffled
throat
and
bare
arms
;
but
the
effect
*NL*
was
undeniably
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
love
us
--
three
whole
days
at
Skuytercliff
!
''
Beaufort
was
saying
*NL*
in
his
loud
sneering
voice
as
Archer
entered
.
``
You
'd
better
take
all
*NL*
your
furs
,
and
a
hot-water-bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Is
the
house
so
cold
?
''
she
asked
,
holding
out
her
left
hand
to
*NL*
Archer
in
a
way
mysteriously
suggesting
that
she
expected
him
to
kiss
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
the
missus
is
,
''
said
Beaufort
,
nodding
carelessly
to
the
young
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
her
so
kind
.
She
came
herself
to
invite
me
.
Granny
says
*NL*
I
must
certainly
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granny
would
,
of
course
.
And
I
say
it
's
a
shame
you
're
going
to
miss
*NL*
the
little
oyster
supper
I
'd
planned
for
you
at
Delmonico
's
next
*NL*
Sunday
,
with
Campanini
and
Scalchi
and
a
lot
of
jolly
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
doubtfully
from
the
banker
to
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
that
does
tempt
me
!
Except
the
other
evening
at
Mrs.
Struthers
's
*NL*
I
've
not
met
a
single
artist
since
I
've
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
of
artists
?
I
know
one
or
two
painters
,
very
good
fellows
,
*NL*
that
I
could
bring
to
see
you
if
you
'd
allow
me
,
''
said
Archer
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Painters
?
Are
there
painters
in
New
York
?
''
asked
Beaufort
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
implying
that
there
could
be
none
since
he
did
not
buy
their
pictures
;
*NL*
and
Madame
Olenska
said
to
Archer
,
with
her
grave
smile
:
``
That
would
*NL*
be
charming
.
But
I
was
really
thinking
of
dramatic
artists
,
singers
,
*NL*
actors
,
musicians
.
My
husband
's
house
was
always
full
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
the
words
``
my
husband
''
as
if
no
sinister
associations
were
*NL*
connected
with
them
,
and
in
a
tone
that
seemed
almost
to
sigh
over
the
*NL*
lost
delights
of
her
married
life
.
Archer
looked
at
her
perplexedly
,
*NL*
wondering
if
it
were
lightness
or
dissimulation
that
enabled
her
to
*NL*
touch
so
easily
on
the
past
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
risking
her
*NL*
reputation
in
order
to
break
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
,
''
she
went
on
,
addressing
both
men
,
``
that
the
imprevu
adds
*NL*
to
one
's
enjoyment
.
It
's
perhaps
a
mistake
to
see
the
same
people
*NL*
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
confoundedly
dull
,
anyhow
;
New
York
is
dying
of
dullness
,
''
*NL*
Beaufort
grumbled
.
``
And
when
I
try
to
liven
it
up
for
you
,
you
go
back
*NL*
on
me
.
Come
--
think
better
of
it
!
Sunday
is
your
last
chance
,
for
*NL*
Campanini
leaves
next
week
for
Baltimore
and
Philadelphia
;
and
I
've
a
*NL*
private
room
,
and
a
Steinway
,
and
they
'll
sing
all
night
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
delicious
!
May
I
think
it
over
,
and
write
to
you
tomorrow
*NL*
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
amiably
,
yet
with
the
least
hint
of
dismissal
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
Beaufort
evidently
felt
it
,
and
being
unused
to
dismissals
,
stood
*NL*
staring
at
her
with
an
obstinate
line
between
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
serious
a
question
to
decide
at
this
late
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
it
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
his
glance
coolly
.
``
Yes
;
because
I
have
still
to
talk
*NL*
business
with
Mr.
Archer
for
a
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Beaufort
snapped
.
There
was
no
appeal
from
her
tone
,
and
with
a
*NL*
slight
shrug
he
recovered
his
composure
,
took
her
hand
,
which
he
kissed
*NL*
with
a
practised
air
,
and
calling
out
from
the
threshold
:
``
I
say
,
*NL*
Newland
,
if
you
can
persuade
the
Countess
to
stop
in
town
of
course
*NL*
you
're
included
in
the
supper
,
''
left
the
room
with
his
heavy
important
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Archer
fancied
that
Mr.
Letterblair
must
have
told
her
of
*NL*
his
coming
;
but
the
irrelevance
of
her
next
remark
made
him
change
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
painters
,
then
?
You
live
in
their
milieu
?
''
she
asked
,
her
*NL*
eyes
full
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
exactly
.
I
do
n't
know
that
the
arts
have
a
milieu
here
,
any
*NL*
of
them
;
they
're
more
like
a
very
thinly
settled
outskirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
care
for
such
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immensely
.
When
I
'm
in
Paris
or
London
I
never
miss
an
exhibition
.
I
*NL*
try
to
keep
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
down
at
the
tip
of
the
little
satin
boot
that
peeped
from
*NL*
her
long
draperies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
care
immensely
too
:
my
life
was
full
of
such
things
.
But
*NL*
now
I
want
to
try
not
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
try
not
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
I
want
to
cast
off
all
my
old
life
,
to
become
just
like
everybody
*NL*
else
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
reddened
.
``
You
'll
never
be
like
everybody
else
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
straight
eyebrows
a
little
.
``
Ah
,
do
n't
say
that
.
If
*NL*
you
knew
how
I
hate
to
be
different
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
had
grown
as
sombre
as
a
tragic
mask
.
She
leaned
forward
,
*NL*
clasping
her
knee
in
her
thin
hands
,
and
looking
away
from
him
into
*NL*
remote
dark
distances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
get
away
from
it
all
,
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
moment
and
cleared
his
throat
.
``
I
know
.
Mr.
Letterblair
*NL*
has
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
reason
I
've
come
.
He
asked
me
to
--
you
see
I
'm
in
the
firm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
slightly
surprised
,
and
then
her
eyes
brightened
.
``
You
mean
*NL*
you
can
manage
it
for
me
?
I
can
talk
to
you
instead
of
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
?
Oh
,
that
will
be
so
much
easier
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
touched
him
,
and
his
confidence
grew
with
his
*NL*
self-satisfaction
.
He
perceived
that
she
had
spoken
of
business
to
*NL*
Beaufort
simply
to
get
rid
of
him
;
and
to
have
routed
Beaufort
was
*NL*
something
of
a
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
to
talk
about
it
,
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
silent
,
her
head
still
propped
by
the
arm
that
rested
on
the
*NL*
back
of
the
sofa
.
Her
face
looked
pale
and
extinguished
,
as
if
dimmed
*NL*
by
the
rich
red
of
her
dress
.
She
struck
Archer
,
of
a
sudden
,
as
a
*NL*
pathetic
and
even
pitiful
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
're
coming
to
hard
facts
,
''
he
thought
,
conscious
in
himself
of
*NL*
the
same
instinctive
recoil
that
he
had
so
often
criticised
in
his
*NL*
mother
and
her
contemporaries
.
How
little
practice
he
had
had
in
*NL*
dealing
with
unusual
situations
!
Their
very
vocabulary
was
unfamiliar
*NL*
to
him
,
and
seemed
to
belong
to
fiction
and
the
stage
.
In
face
of
what
*NL*
was
coming
he
felt
as
awkward
and
embarrassed
as
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
Madame
Olenska
broke
out
with
unexpected
vehemence
:
``
I
*NL*
want
to
be
free
;
I
want
to
wipe
out
all
the
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
warmed
.
``
Then
you
'll
help
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
--
''
he
hesitated
--
``
perhaps
I
ought
to
know
a
little
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
surprised
.
``
You
know
about
my
husband
--
my
life
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
sign
of
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
then
--
what
more
is
there
?
In
this
country
are
such
things
*NL*
tolerated
?
I
'm
a
Protestant
--
our
church
does
not
forbid
divorce
in
*NL*
such
cases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
again
,
and
Archer
felt
the
spectre
of
Count
*NL*
Olenski
's
letter
grimacing
hideously
between
them
.
The
letter
filled
*NL*
only
half
a
page
,
and
was
just
what
he
had
described
it
to
be
in
*NL*
speaking
of
it
to
Mr.
Letterblair
:
the
vague
charge
of
an
angry
*NL*
blackguard
.
But
how
much
truth
was
behind
it
?
Only
Count
Olenski
's
*NL*
wife
could
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
looked
through
the
papers
you
gave
to
Mr.
Letterblair
,
''
he
said
*NL*
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
can
there
be
anything
more
abominable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
changed
her
position
slightly
,
screening
her
eyes
with
her
lifted
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
know
,
''
Archer
continued
,
``
that
if
your
husband
chooses
*NL*
to
fight
the
case
--
as
he
threatens
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
say
things
--
things
that
might
be
unpl
--
might
be
disagreeable
to
*NL*
you
:
say
them
publicly
,
so
that
they
would
get
about
,
and
harm
you
even
*NL*
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
:
no
matter
how
unfounded
they
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
for
a
long
interval
;
so
long
that
,
not
wishing
to
keep
his
*NL*
eyes
on
her
shaded
face
,
he
had
time
to
imprint
on
his
mind
the
exact
*NL*
shape
of
her
other
hand
,
the
one
on
her
knee
,
and
every
detail
of
the
*NL*
three
rings
on
her
fourth
and
fifth
fingers
;
among
which
,
he
noticed
,
a
*NL*
wedding
ring
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
harm
could
such
accusations
,
even
if
he
made
them
publicly
,
do
me
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
his
lips
to
exclaim
:
``
My
poor
child
--
far
more
harm
than
*NL*
anywhere
else
!
''
Instead
,
he
answered
,
in
a
voice
that
sounded
in
his
*NL*
ears
like
Mr.
Letterblair
's
:
``
New
York
society
is
a
very
small
world
*NL*
compared
with
the
one
you
've
lived
in
.
And
it
's
ruled
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
appearances
,
by
a
few
people
with
--
well
,
rather
old-fashioned
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
,
and
he
continued
:
``
Our
ideas
about
marriage
and
*NL*
divorce
are
particularly
old-fashioned
.
Our
legislation
favours
*NL*
divorce
--
our
social
customs
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
not
if
the
woman
,
however
injured
,
however
irreproachable
,
has
*NL*
appearances
in
the
least
degree
against
her
,
has
exposed
herself
by
any
*NL*
unconventional
action
to
--
to
offensive
insinuations
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drooped
her
head
a
little
lower
,
and
he
waited
again
,
intensely
*NL*
hoping
for
a
flash
of
indignation
,
or
at
least
a
brief
cry
of
denial
.
*NL*
None
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
travelling
clock
ticked
purringly
at
her
elbow
,
and
a
log
*NL*
broke
in
two
and
sent
up
a
shower
of
sparks
.
The
whole
hushed
and
*NL*
brooding
room
seemed
to
be
waiting
silently
with
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
murmured
at
length
,
``
that
's
what
my
family
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
winced
a
little
.
``
It
's
not
unnatural
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
OUR
family
,
''
she
corrected
herself
;
and
Archer
coloured
.
``
For
you
'll
*NL*
be
my
cousin
soon
,
''
she
continued
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
take
their
view
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
at
this
,
wandered
across
the
room
,
stared
with
void
eyes
at
*NL*
one
of
the
pictures
against
the
old
red
damask
,
and
came
back
*NL*
irresolutely
to
her
side
.
How
could
he
say
:
``
Yes
,
if
what
your
*NL*
husband
hints
is
true
,
or
if
you
've
no
way
of
disproving
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sincerely
--
''
she
interjected
,
as
he
was
about
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
down
into
the
fire
.
``
Sincerely
,
then
--
what
should
you
gain
*NL*
that
would
compensate
for
the
possibility
--
the
certainty
--
of
a
lot
of
*NL*
beastly
talk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
freedom
--
is
that
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
flashed
across
him
at
that
instant
that
the
charge
in
the
letter
was
*NL*
true
,
and
that
she
hoped
to
marry
the
partner
of
her
guilt
.
How
was
he
*NL*
to
tell
her
that
,
if
she
really
cherished
such
a
plan
,
the
laws
of
the
*NL*
State
were
inexorably
opposed
to
it
?
The
mere
suspicion
that
the
*NL*
thought
was
in
her
mind
made
him
feel
harshly
and
impatiently
toward
*NL*
her
.
``
But
are
n't
you
as
free
as
air
as
it
is
?
''
he
returned
.
``
Who
can
*NL*
touch
you
?
Mr.
Letterblair
tells
me
the
financial
question
has
been
*NL*
settled
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
:
is
it
worth
while
to
risk
what
may
be
infinitely
*NL*
disagreeable
and
painful
?
Think
of
the
newspapers
--
their
vileness
!
*NL*
It
's
all
stupid
and
narrow
and
unjust
--
but
one
ca
n't
make
over
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
acquiesced
;
and
her
tone
was
so
faint
and
desolate
that
he
*NL*
felt
a
sudden
remorse
for
his
own
hard
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
individual
,
in
such
cases
,
is
nearly
always
sacrificed
to
what
is
*NL*
supposed
to
be
the
collective
interest
:
people
cling
to
any
convention
*NL*
that
keeps
the
family
together
--
protects
the
children
,
if
there
are
*NL*
any
,
''
he
rambled
on
,
pouring
out
all
the
stock
phrases
that
rose
to
his
*NL*
lips
in
his
intense
desire
to
cover
over
the
ugly
reality
which
her
*NL*
silence
seemed
to
have
laid
bare
.
Since
she
would
not
or
could
not
say
*NL*
the
one
word
that
would
have
cleared
the
air
,
his
wish
was
not
to
let
*NL*
her
feel
that
he
was
trying
to
probe
into
her
secret
.
Better
keep
on
*NL*
the
surface
,
in
the
prudent
old
New
York
way
,
than
risk
uncovering
a
*NL*
wound
he
could
not
heal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
my
business
,
you
know
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
to
help
you
to
see
these
*NL*
things
as
the
people
who
are
fondest
of
you
see
them
.
The
Mingotts
,
*NL*
the
Wellands
,
the
van
der
Luydens
,
all
your
friends
and
relations
:
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
show
you
honestly
how
they
judge
such
questions
,
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
fair
of
me
,
would
it
?
''
He
spoke
insistently
,
almost
pleading
with
her
*NL*
in
his
eagerness
to
cover
up
that
yawning
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
slowly
:
``
No
;
it
would
n't
be
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
had
crumbled
down
to
greyness
,
and
one
of
the
lamps
made
a
*NL*
gurgling
appeal
for
attention
.
Madame
Olenska
rose
,
wound
it
up
and
*NL*
returned
to
the
fire
,
but
without
resuming
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
remaining
on
her
feet
seemed
to
signify
that
there
was
nothing
more
*NL*
for
either
of
them
to
say
,
and
Archer
stood
up
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
will
do
what
you
wish
,
''
she
said
abruptly
.
The
blood
*NL*
rushed
to
his
forehead
;
and
,
taken
aback
by
the
suddenness
of
her
*NL*
surrender
,
he
caught
her
two
hands
awkwardly
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
do
want
to
help
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
help
me
.
Good
night
,
my
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
and
laid
his
lips
on
her
hands
,
which
were
cold
and
lifeless
.
*NL*
She
drew
them
away
,
and
he
turned
to
the
door
,
found
his
coat
and
hat
*NL*
under
the
faint
gas-light
of
the
hall
,
and
plunged
out
into
the
winter
*NL*
night
bursting
with
the
belated
eloquence
of
the
inarticulate
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
crowded
night
at
Wallack
's
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
was
``
The
Shaughraun
,
''
with
Dion
Boucicault
in
the
title
role
*NL*
and
Harry
Montague
and
Ada
Dyas
as
the
lovers
.
The
popularity
of
the
*NL*
admirable
English
company
was
at
its
height
,
and
the
Shaughraun
always
*NL*
packed
the
house
.
In
the
galleries
the
enthusiasm
was
unreserved
;
in
*NL*
the
stalls
and
boxes
,
people
smiled
a
little
at
the
hackneyed
*NL*
sentiments
and
clap-trap
situations
,
and
enjoyed
the
play
as
much
as
*NL*
the
galleries
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
episode
,
in
particular
,
that
held
the
house
from
floor
to
*NL*
ceiling
.
It
was
that
in
which
Harry
Montague
,
after
a
sad
,
almost
*NL*
monosyllabic
scene
of
parting
with
Miss
Dyas
,
bade
her
good-bye
,
and
*NL*
turned
to
go
.
The
actress
,
who
was
standing
near
the
mantelpiece
and
*NL*
looking
down
into
the
fire
,
wore
a
gray
cashmere
dress
without
*NL*
fashionable
loopings
or
trimmings
,
moulded
to
her
tall
figure
and
*NL*
flowing
in
long
lines
about
her
feet
.
Around
her
neck
was
a
narrow
*NL*
black
velvet
ribbon
with
the
ends
falling
down
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
wooer
turned
from
her
she
rested
her
arms
against
the
*NL*
mantel-shelf
and
bowed
her
face
in
her
hands
.
On
the
threshold
he
*NL*
paused
to
look
at
her
;
then
he
stole
back
,
lifted
one
of
the
ends
of
*NL*
velvet
ribbon
,
kissed
it
,
and
left
the
room
without
her
hearing
him
or
*NL*
changing
her
attitude
.
And
on
this
silent
parting
the
curtain
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
for
the
sake
of
that
particular
scene
that
Newland
Archer
*NL*
went
to
see
``
The
Shaughraun
.
''
He
thought
the
adieux
of
Montague
and
Ada
*NL*
Dyas
as
fine
as
anything
he
had
ever
seen
Croisette
and
Bressant
do
in
*NL*
Paris
,
or
Madge
Robertson
and
Kendal
in
London
;
in
its
reticence
,
its
*NL*
dumb
sorrow
,
it
moved
him
more
than
the
most
famous
histrionic
*NL*
outpourings
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
in
question
the
little
scene
acquired
an
added
poignancy
*NL*
by
reminding
him
--
he
could
not
have
said
why
--
of
his
leave-taking
from
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
after
their
confidential
talk
a
week
or
ten
days
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
as
difficult
to
discover
any
resemblance
between
the
*NL*
two
situations
as
between
the
appearance
of
the
persons
concerned
.
*NL*
Newland
Archer
could
not
pretend
to
anything
approaching
the
young
*NL*
English
actor
's
romantic
good
looks
,
and
Miss
Dyas
was
a
tall
*NL*
red-haired
woman
of
monumental
build
whose
pale
and
pleasantly
ugly
*NL*
face
was
utterly
unlike
Ellen
Olenska
's
vivid
countenance
.
Nor
were
*NL*
Archer
and
Madame
Olenska
two
lovers
parting
in
heart-broken
silence
;
*NL*
they
were
client
and
lawyer
separating
after
a
talk
which
had
given
the
*NL*
lawyer
the
worst
possible
impression
of
the
client
's
case
.
Wherein
,
*NL*
then
,
lay
the
resemblance
that
made
the
young
man
's
heart
beat
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
retrospective
excitement
?
It
seemed
to
be
in
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
mysterious
faculty
of
suggesting
tragic
and
moving
possibilities
*NL*
outside
the
daily
run
of
experience
.
She
had
hardly
ever
said
a
word
*NL*
to
him
to
produce
this
impression
,
but
it
was
a
part
of
her
,
either
a
*NL*
projection
of
her
mysterious
and
outlandish
background
or
of
something
*NL*
inherently
dramatic
,
passionate
and
unusual
in
herself
.
Archer
had
*NL*
always
been
inclined
to
think
that
chance
and
circumstance
played
a
*NL*
small
part
in
shaping
people
's
lots
compared
with
their
innate
tendency
*NL*
to
have
things
happen
to
them
.
This
tendency
he
had
felt
from
the
*NL*
first
in
Madame
Olenska
.
The
quiet
,
almost
passive
young
woman
struck
*NL*
him
as
exactly
the
kind
of
person
to
whom
things
were
bound
to
happen
,
*NL*
no
matter
how
much
she
shrank
from
them
and
went
out
of
her
way
to
*NL*
avoid
them
.
The
exciting
fact
was
her
having
lived
in
an
atmosphere
so
*NL*
thick
with
drama
that
her
own
tendency
to
provoke
it
had
apparently
*NL*
passed
unperceived
.
It
was
precisely
the
odd
absence
of
surprise
in
*NL*
her
that
gave
him
the
sense
of
her
having
been
plucked
out
of
a
very
*NL*
maelstrom
:
the
things
she
took
for
granted
gave
the
measure
of
those
*NL*
she
had
rebelled
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
left
her
with
the
conviction
that
Count
Olenski
's
accusation
*NL*
was
not
unfounded
.
The
mysterious
person
who
figured
in
his
wife
's
*NL*
past
as
``
the
secretary
''
had
probably
not
been
unrewarded
for
his
share
*NL*
in
her
escape
.
The
conditions
from
which
she
had
fled
were
*NL*
intolerable
,
past
speaking
of
,
past
believing
:
she
was
young
,
she
was
*NL*
frightened
,
she
was
desperate
--
what
more
natural
than
that
she
should
*NL*
be
grateful
to
her
rescuer
?
The
pity
was
that
her
gratitude
put
her
,
*NL*
in
the
law
's
eyes
and
the
world
's
,
on
a
par
with
her
abominable
*NL*
husband
.
Archer
had
made
her
understand
this
,
as
he
was
bound
to
do
;
*NL*
he
had
also
made
her
understand
that
simplehearted
kindly
New
York
,
on
*NL*
whose
larger
charity
she
had
apparently
counted
,
was
precisely
the
*NL*
place
where
she
could
least
hope
for
indulgence
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
to
make
this
fact
plain
to
her
--
and
to
witness
her
resigned
*NL*
acceptance
of
it
--
had
been
intolerably
painful
to
him
.
He
felt
himself
*NL*
drawn
to
her
by
obscure
feelings
of
jealousy
and
pity
,
as
if
her
*NL*
dumbly-confessed
error
had
put
her
at
his
mercy
,
humbling
yet
endearing
*NL*
her
.
He
was
glad
it
was
to
him
she
had
revealed
her
secret
,
rather
*NL*
than
to
the
cold
scrutiny
of
Mr.
Letterblair
,
or
the
embarrassed
gaze
*NL*
of
her
family
.
He
immediately
took
it
upon
himself
to
assure
them
both
*NL*
that
she
had
given
up
her
idea
of
seeking
a
divorce
,
basing
her
*NL*
decision
on
the
fact
that
she
had
understood
the
uselessness
of
the
*NL*
proceeding
;
and
with
infinite
relief
they
had
all
turned
their
eyes
*NL*
from
the
``
unpleasantness
''
she
had
spared
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
Newland
would
manage
it
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
had
said
proudly
of
*NL*
her
future
son-in-law
;
and
old
Mrs.
Mingott
,
who
had
summoned
him
for
a
*NL*
confidential
interview
,
had
congratulated
him
on
his
cleverness
,
and
*NL*
added
impatiently
:
``
Silly
goose
!
I
told
her
myself
what
nonsense
it
*NL*
was
.
Wanting
to
pass
herself
off
as
Ellen
Mingott
and
an
old
maid
,
*NL*
when
she
has
the
luck
to
be
a
married
woman
and
a
Countess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
incidents
had
made
the
memory
of
his
last
talk
with
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
so
vivid
to
the
young
man
that
as
the
curtain
fell
on
the
*NL*
parting
of
the
two
actors
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
he
stood
up
*NL*
to
leave
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
doing
so
,
he
turned
to
the
side
of
the
house
behind
him
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
lady
of
whom
he
was
thinking
seated
in
a
box
with
the
Beauforts
,
*NL*
Lawrence
Lefferts
and
one
or
two
other
men
.
He
had
not
spoken
with
her
*NL*
alone
since
their
evening
together
,
and
had
tried
to
avoid
being
with
*NL*
her
in
company
;
but
now
their
eyes
met
,
and
as
Mrs.
Beaufort
recognised
*NL*
him
at
the
same
time
,
and
made
her
languid
little
gesture
of
*NL*
invitation
,
it
was
impossible
not
to
go
into
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
and
Lefferts
made
way
for
him
,
and
after
a
few
words
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Beaufort
,
who
always
preferred
to
look
beautiful
and
not
have
to
talk
,
*NL*
Archer
seated
himself
behind
Madame
Olenska
.
There
was
no
one
else
in
*NL*
the
box
but
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
,
who
was
telling
Mrs.
Beaufort
in
a
*NL*
confidential
undertone
about
Mrs.
Lemuel
Struthers
's
last
Sunday
*NL*
reception
-LRB-
where
some
people
reported
that
there
had
been
dancing
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Under
cover
of
this
circumstantial
narrative
,
to
which
Mrs.
Beaufort
*NL*
listened
with
her
perfect
smile
,
and
her
head
at
just
the
right
angle
*NL*
to
be
seen
in
profile
from
the
stalls
,
Madame
Olenska
turned
and
spoke
*NL*
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
she
asked
,
glancing
toward
the
stage
,
``
he
will
send
her
*NL*
a
bunch
of
yellow
roses
tomorrow
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
reddened
,
and
his
heart
gave
a
leap
of
surprise
.
He
had
called
*NL*
only
twice
on
Madame
Olenska
,
and
each
time
he
had
sent
her
a
box
of
*NL*
yellow
roses
,
and
each
time
without
a
card
.
She
had
never
before
made
*NL*
any
allusion
to
the
flowers
,
and
he
supposed
she
had
never
thought
of
*NL*
him
as
the
sender
.
Now
her
sudden
recognition
of
the
gift
,
and
her
*NL*
associating
it
with
the
tender
leave-taking
on
the
stage
,
filled
him
*NL*
with
an
agitated
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
of
that
too
--
I
was
going
to
leave
the
theatre
in
order
*NL*
to
take
the
picture
away
with
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
surprise
her
colour
rose
,
reluctantly
and
duskily
.
She
looked
*NL*
down
at
the
mother-of-pearl
opera-glass
in
her
smoothly
gloved
hands
,
*NL*
and
said
,
after
a
pause
:
``
What
do
you
do
while
May
is
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stick
to
my
work
,
''
he
answered
,
faintly
annoyed
by
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
obedience
to
a
long-established
habit
,
the
Wellands
had
left
the
*NL*
previous
week
for
St.
Augustine
,
where
,
out
of
regard
for
the
supposed
*NL*
susceptibility
of
Mr.
Welland
's
bronchial
tubes
,
they
always
spent
the
*NL*
latter
part
of
the
winter
.
Mr.
Welland
was
a
mild
and
silent
man
,
with
*NL*
no
opinions
but
with
many
habits
.
With
these
habits
none
might
*NL*
interfere
;
and
one
of
them
demanded
that
his
wife
and
daughter
should
*NL*
always
go
with
him
on
his
annual
journey
to
the
south
.
To
preserve
an
*NL*
unbroken
domesticity
was
essential
to
his
peace
of
mind
;
he
would
not
*NL*
have
known
where
his
hair-brushes
were
,
or
how
to
provide
stamps
for
*NL*
his
letters
,
if
Mrs.
Welland
had
not
been
there
to
tell
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
all
the
members
of
the
family
adored
each
other
,
and
as
Mr.
Welland
*NL*
was
the
central
object
of
their
idolatry
,
it
never
occurred
to
his
wife
*NL*
and
May
to
let
him
go
to
St.
Augustine
alone
;
and
his
sons
,
who
were
*NL*
both
in
the
law
,
and
could
not
leave
New
York
during
the
winter
,
always
*NL*
joined
him
for
Easter
and
travelled
back
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
Archer
to
discuss
the
necessity
of
May
's
*NL*
accompanying
her
father
.
The
reputation
of
the
Mingotts
'
family
*NL*
physician
was
largely
based
on
the
attack
of
pneumonia
which
Mr.
*NL*
Welland
had
never
had
;
and
his
insistence
on
St.
Augustine
was
*NL*
therefore
inflexible
.
Originally
,
it
had
been
intended
that
May
's
*NL*
engagement
should
not
be
announced
till
her
return
from
Florida
,
and
*NL*
the
fact
that
it
had
been
made
known
sooner
could
not
be
expected
to
*NL*
alter
Mr.
Welland
's
plans
.
Archer
would
have
liked
to
join
the
*NL*
travellers
and
have
a
few
weeks
of
sunshine
and
boating
with
his
*NL*
betrothed
;
but
he
too
was
bound
by
custom
and
conventions
.
Little
*NL*
arduous
as
his
professional
duties
were
,
he
would
have
been
convicted
*NL*
of
frivolity
by
the
whole
Mingott
clan
if
he
had
suggested
asking
for
a
*NL*
holiday
in
mid-winter
;
and
he
accepted
May
's
departure
with
the
*NL*
resignation
which
he
perceived
would
have
to
be
one
of
the
principal
*NL*
constituents
of
married
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
that
Madame
Olenska
was
looking
at
him
under
lowered
*NL*
lids
.
``
I
have
done
what
you
wished
--
what
you
advised
,
''
she
said
*NL*
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
'm
glad
,
''
he
returned
,
embarrassed
by
her
broaching
the
subject
*NL*
at
such
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
--
that
you
were
right
,
''
she
went
on
a
little
breathlessly
;
*NL*
``
but
sometimes
life
is
difficult
...
perplexing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wanted
to
tell
you
that
I
DO
feel
you
were
right
;
and
that
I
'm
*NL*
grateful
to
you
,
''
she
ended
,
lifting
her
opera-glass
quickly
to
her
*NL*
eyes
as
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
Beaufort
's
resonant
voice
broke
*NL*
in
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
stood
up
,
and
left
the
box
and
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
day
before
he
had
received
a
letter
from
May
Welland
in
which
,
*NL*
with
characteristic
candour
,
she
had
asked
him
to
``
be
kind
to
Ellen
''
in
*NL*
their
absence
.
``
She
likes
you
and
admires
you
so
much
--
and
you
know
,
*NL*
though
she
does
n't
show
it
,
she
's
still
very
lonely
and
unhappy
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
Granny
understands
her
,
or
uncle
Lovell
Mingott
either
;
*NL*
they
really
think
she
's
much
worldlier
and
fonder
of
society
than
she
*NL*
is
.
And
I
can
quite
see
that
New
York
must
seem
dull
to
her
,
though
*NL*
the
family
wo
n't
admit
it
.
I
think
she
's
been
used
to
lots
of
things
*NL*
we
have
n't
got
;
wonderful
music
,
and
picture
shows
,
and
*NL*
celebrities
--
artists
and
authors
and
all
the
clever
people
you
admire
.
*NL*
Granny
ca
n't
understand
her
wanting
anything
but
lots
of
dinners
and
*NL*
clothes
--
but
I
can
see
that
you
're
almost
the
only
person
in
New
York
*NL*
who
can
talk
to
her
about
what
she
really
cares
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wise
May
--
how
he
had
loved
her
for
that
letter
!
But
he
had
not
*NL*
meant
to
act
on
it
;
he
was
too
busy
,
to
begin
with
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
care
,
as
an
engaged
man
,
to
play
too
conspicuously
the
part
of
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
's
champion
.
He
had
an
idea
that
she
knew
how
to
take
care
of
*NL*
herself
a
good
deal
better
than
the
ingenuous
May
imagined
.
She
had
*NL*
Beaufort
at
her
feet
,
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
hovering
above
her
like
a
*NL*
protecting
deity
,
and
any
number
of
candidates
-LRB-
Lawrence
Lefferts
among
*NL*
them
-RRB-
waiting
their
opportunity
in
the
middle
distance
.
Yet
he
never
*NL*
saw
her
,
or
exchanged
a
word
with
her
,
without
feeling
that
,
after
all
,
*NL*
May
's
ingenuousness
almost
amounted
to
a
gift
of
divination
.
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
was
lonely
and
she
was
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
came
out
into
the
lobby
Archer
ran
across
his
friend
Ned
Winsett
,
*NL*
the
only
one
among
what
Janey
called
his
``
clever
people
''
with
whom
he
*NL*
cared
to
probe
into
things
a
little
deeper
than
the
average
level
of
*NL*
club
and
chop-house
banter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
caught
sight
,
across
the
house
,
of
Winsett
's
shabby
*NL*
round-shouldered
back
,
and
had
once
noticed
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
*NL*
Beaufort
box
.
The
two
men
shook
hands
,
and
Winsett
proposed
a
bock
at
*NL*
a
little
German
restaurant
around
the
corner
.
Archer
,
who
was
not
in
*NL*
the
mood
for
the
kind
of
talk
they
were
likely
to
get
there
,
declined
*NL*
on
the
plea
that
he
had
work
to
do
at
home
;
and
Winsett
said
:
``
Oh
,
*NL*
well
so
have
I
for
that
matter
,
and
I
'll
be
the
Industrious
Apprentice
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
strolled
along
together
,
and
presently
Winsett
said
:
``
Look
here
,
*NL*
what
I
'm
really
after
is
the
name
of
the
dark
lady
in
that
swell
box
of
*NL*
yours
--
with
the
Beauforts
,
was
n't
she
?
The
one
your
friend
Lefferts
*NL*
seems
so
smitten
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
he
could
not
have
said
why
,
was
slightly
annoyed
.
What
the
*NL*
devil
did
Ned
Winsett
want
with
Ellen
Olenska
's
name
?
And
above
all
,
*NL*
why
did
he
couple
it
with
Lefferts
's
?
It
was
unlike
Winsett
to
*NL*
manifest
such
curiosity
;
but
after
all
,
Archer
remembered
,
he
was
a
*NL*
journalist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
for
an
interview
,
I
hope
?
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
not
for
the
press
;
just
for
myself
,
''
Winsett
rejoined
.
``
The
*NL*
fact
is
she
's
a
neighbour
of
mine
--
queer
quarter
for
such
a
beauty
to
*NL*
settle
in
--
and
she
's
been
awfully
kind
to
my
little
boy
,
who
fell
down
*NL*
her
area
chasing
his
kitten
,
and
gave
himself
a
nasty
cut
.
She
rushed
*NL*
in
bareheaded
,
carrying
him
in
her
arms
,
with
his
knee
all
beautifully
*NL*
bandaged
,
and
was
so
sympathetic
and
beautiful
that
my
wife
was
too
*NL*
dazzled
to
ask
her
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pleasant
glow
dilated
Archer
's
heart
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
extraordinary
in
the
tale
:
any
woman
would
have
done
as
much
for
a
*NL*
neighbour
's
child
.
But
it
was
just
like
Ellen
,
he
felt
,
to
have
rushed
*NL*
in
bareheaded
,
carrying
the
boy
in
her
arms
,
and
to
have
dazzled
poor
*NL*
Mrs.
Winsett
into
forgetting
to
ask
who
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
Countess
Olenska
--
a
granddaughter
of
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whew
--
a
Countess
!
''
whistled
Ned
Winsett
.
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
Countesses
were
so
neighbourly
.
Mingotts
ai
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
be
,
if
you
'd
let
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
--
''
It
was
their
old
interminable
argument
as
to
the
*NL*
obstinate
unwillingness
of
the
``
clever
people
''
to
frequent
the
*NL*
fashionable
,
and
both
men
knew
that
there
was
no
use
in
prolonging
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
Winsett
broke
off
,
``
how
a
Countess
happens
to
live
in
our
*NL*
slum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
does
n't
care
a
hang
about
where
she
lives
--
or
about
any
of
*NL*
our
little
social
sign-posts
,
''
said
Archer
,
with
a
secret
pride
in
his
*NL*
own
picture
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
been
in
bigger
places
,
I
suppose
,
''
the
other
commented
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
here
's
my
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slouched
off
across
Broadway
,
and
Archer
stood
looking
after
him
and
*NL*
musing
on
his
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
Winsett
had
those
flashes
of
penetration
;
they
were
the
most
*NL*
interesting
thing
about
him
,
and
always
made
Archer
wonder
why
they
had
*NL*
allowed
him
to
accept
failure
so
stolidly
at
an
age
when
most
men
are
*NL*
still
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
known
that
Winsett
had
a
wife
and
child
,
but
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
them
.
The
two
men
always
met
at
the
Century
,
or
at
some
haunt
of
*NL*
journalists
and
theatrical
people
,
such
as
the
restaurant
where
Winsett
*NL*
had
proposed
to
go
for
a
bock
.
He
had
given
Archer
to
understand
that
*NL*
his
wife
was
an
invalid
;
which
might
be
true
of
the
poor
lady
,
or
might
*NL*
merely
mean
that
she
was
lacking
in
social
gifts
or
in
evening
clothes
,
*NL*
or
in
both
.
Winsett
himself
had
a
savage
abhorrence
of
social
*NL*
observances
:
Archer
,
who
dressed
in
the
evening
because
he
thought
it
*NL*
cleaner
and
more
comfortable
to
do
so
,
and
who
had
never
stopped
to
*NL*
consider
that
cleanliness
and
comfort
are
two
of
the
costliest
items
in
*NL*
a
modest
budget
,
regarded
Winsett
's
attitude
as
part
of
the
boring
*NL*
``
Bohemian
''
pose
that
always
made
fashionable
people
,
who
changed
their
*NL*
clothes
without
talking
about
it
,
and
were
not
forever
harping
on
the
*NL*
number
of
servants
one
kept
,
seem
so
much
simpler
and
less
*NL*
self-conscious
than
the
others
.
Nevertheless
,
he
was
always
stimulated
*NL*
by
Winsett
,
and
whenever
he
caught
sight
of
the
journalist
's
lean
*NL*
bearded
face
and
melancholy
eyes
he
would
rout
him
out
of
his
corner
*NL*
and
carry
him
off
for
a
long
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winsett
was
not
a
journalist
by
choice
.
He
was
a
pure
man
of
letters
,
*NL*
untimely
born
in
a
world
that
had
no
need
of
letters
;
but
after
*NL*
publishing
one
volume
of
brief
and
exquisite
literary
appreciations
,
of
*NL*
which
one
hundred
and
twenty
copies
were
sold
,
thirty
given
away
,
and
*NL*
the
balance
eventually
destroyed
by
the
publishers
-LRB-
as
per
contract
-RRB-
to
*NL*
make
room
for
more
marketable
material
,
he
had
abandoned
his
real
*NL*
calling
,
and
taken
a
sub-editorial
job
on
a
women
's
weekly
,
where
*NL*
fashion-plates
and
paper
patterns
alternated
with
New
England
*NL*
love-stories
and
advertisements
of
temperance
drinks
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
subject
of
``
Hearth-fires
''
-LRB-
as
the
paper
was
called
-RRB-
he
was
*NL*
inexhaustibly
entertaining
;
but
beneath
his
fun
lurked
the
sterile
*NL*
bitterness
of
the
still
young
man
who
has
tried
and
given
up
.
His
*NL*
conversation
always
made
Archer
take
the
measure
of
his
own
life
,
and
*NL*
feel
how
little
it
contained
;
but
Winsett
's
,
after
all
,
contained
still
*NL*
less
,
and
though
their
common
fund
of
intellectual
interests
and
*NL*
curiosities
made
their
talks
exhilarating
,
their
exchange
of
views
*NL*
usually
remained
within
the
limits
of
a
pensive
dilettantism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
life
is
n't
much
a
fit
for
either
of
us
,
''
Winsett
had
once
*NL*
said
.
``
I
'm
down
and
out
;
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
.
I
've
got
only
*NL*
one
ware
to
produce
,
and
there
's
no
market
for
it
here
,
and
wo
n't
be
in
*NL*
my
time
.
But
you
're
free
and
you
're
well-off
.
Why
do
n't
you
get
into
*NL*
touch
?
There
's
only
one
way
to
do
it
:
to
go
into
politics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
.
There
one
saw
at
a
flash
the
*NL*
unbridgeable
difference
between
men
like
Winsett
and
the
*NL*
others
--
Archer
's
kind
.
Every
one
in
polite
circles
knew
that
,
in
*NL*
America
,
``
a
gentleman
could
n't
go
into
politics
.
''
But
,
since
he
could
*NL*
hardly
put
it
in
that
way
to
Winsett
,
he
answered
evasively
:
``
Look
at
*NL*
the
career
of
the
honest
man
in
American
politics
!
They
do
n't
want
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
`
they
'
?
Why
do
n't
you
all
get
together
and
be
`
they
'
*NL*
yourselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
laugh
lingered
on
his
lips
in
a
slightly
condescending
smile
.
*NL*
It
was
useless
to
prolong
the
discussion
:
everybody
knew
the
melancholy
*NL*
fate
of
the
few
gentlemen
who
had
risked
their
clean
linen
in
municipal
*NL*
or
state
politics
in
New
York
.
The
day
was
past
when
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
was
possible
:
the
country
was
in
possession
of
the
bosses
and
the
*NL*
emigrant
,
and
decent
people
had
to
fall
back
on
sport
or
culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Culture
!
Yes
--
if
we
had
it
!
But
there
are
just
a
few
little
local
*NL*
patches
,
dying
out
here
and
there
for
lack
of
--
well
,
hoeing
and
*NL*
cross-fertilising
:
the
last
remnants
of
the
old
European
tradition
that
*NL*
your
forebears
brought
with
them
.
But
you
're
in
a
pitiful
little
*NL*
minority
:
you
've
got
no
centre
,
no
competition
,
no
audience
.
You
're
*NL*
like
the
pictures
on
the
walls
of
a
deserted
house
:
`
The
Portrait
of
a
*NL*
Gentleman
.
'
You
'll
never
amount
to
anything
,
any
of
you
,
till
you
roll
*NL*
up
your
sleeves
and
get
right
down
into
the
muck
.
That
,
or
emigrate
*NL*
...
God
!
If
I
could
emigrate
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
mentally
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
the
conversation
back
*NL*
to
books
,
where
Winsett
,
if
uncertain
,
was
always
interesting
.
*NL*
Emigrate
!
As
if
a
gentleman
could
abandon
his
own
country
!
One
could
*NL*
no
more
do
that
than
one
could
roll
up
one
's
sleeves
and
go
down
into
*NL*
the
muck
.
A
gentleman
simply
stayed
at
home
and
abstained
.
But
you
*NL*
could
n't
make
a
man
like
Winsett
see
that
;
and
that
was
why
the
New
*NL*
York
of
literary
clubs
and
exotic
restaurants
,
though
a
first
shake
*NL*
made
it
seem
more
of
a
kaleidoscope
,
turned
out
,
in
the
end
,
to
be
a
*NL*
smaller
box
,
with
a
more
monotonous
pattern
,
than
the
assembled
atoms
*NL*
of
Fifth
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Archer
scoured
the
town
in
vain
for
more
yellow
roses
.
*NL*
In
consequence
of
this
search
he
arrived
late
at
the
office
,
perceived
*NL*
that
his
doing
so
made
no
difference
whatever
to
any
one
,
and
was
*NL*
filled
with
sudden
exasperation
at
the
elaborate
futility
of
his
life
.
*NL*
Why
should
he
not
be
,
at
that
moment
,
on
the
sands
of
St.
Augustine
*NL*
with
May
Welland
?
No
one
was
deceived
by
his
pretense
of
professional
*NL*
activity
.
In
old-fashioned
legal
firms
like
that
of
which
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
was
the
head
,
and
which
were
mainly
engaged
in
the
*NL*
management
of
large
estates
and
``
conservative
''
investments
,
there
were
*NL*
always
two
or
three
young
men
,
fairly
well-off
,
and
without
*NL*
professional
ambition
,
who
,
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
each
day
,
*NL*
sat
at
their
desks
accomplishing
trivial
tasks
,
or
simply
reading
the
*NL*
newspapers
.
Though
it
was
supposed
to
be
proper
for
them
to
have
an
*NL*
occupation
,
the
crude
fact
of
money-making
was
still
regarded
as
*NL*
derogatory
,
and
the
law
,
being
a
profession
,
was
accounted
a
more
*NL*
gentlemanly
pursuit
than
business
.
But
none
of
these
young
men
had
*NL*
much
hope
of
really
advancing
in
his
profession
,
or
any
earnest
desire
*NL*
to
do
so
;
and
over
many
of
them
the
green
mould
of
the
perfunctory
was
*NL*
already
perceptibly
spreading
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
Archer
shiver
to
think
that
it
might
be
spreading
over
him
too
.
*NL*
He
had
,
to
be
sure
,
other
tastes
and
interests
;
he
spent
his
vacations
*NL*
in
European
travel
,
cultivated
the
``
clever
people
''
May
spoke
of
,
and
*NL*
generally
tried
to
``
keep
up
,
''
as
he
had
somewhat
wistfully
put
it
to
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
.
But
once
he
was
married
,
what
would
become
of
this
*NL*
narrow
margin
of
life
in
which
his
real
experiences
were
lived
?
He
had
*NL*
seen
enough
of
other
young
men
who
had
dreamed
his
dream
,
though
*NL*
perhaps
less
ardently
,
and
who
had
gradually
sunk
into
the
placid
and
*NL*
luxurious
routine
of
their
elders
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
office
he
sent
a
note
by
messenger
to
Madame
Olenska
,
asking
*NL*
if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
,
and
begging
her
to
let
him
find
a
*NL*
reply
at
his
club
;
but
at
the
club
he
found
nothing
,
nor
did
he
receive
*NL*
any
letter
the
following
day
.
This
unexpected
silence
mortified
him
*NL*
beyond
reason
,
and
though
the
next
morning
he
saw
a
glorious
cluster
of
*NL*
yellow
roses
behind
a
florist
's
window-pane
,
he
left
it
there
.
It
was
*NL*
only
on
the
third
morning
that
he
received
a
line
by
post
from
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
.
To
his
surprise
it
was
dated
from
Skuytercliff
,
*NL*
whither
the
van
der
Luydens
had
promptly
retreated
after
putting
the
*NL*
Duke
on
board
his
steamer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ran
away
,
''
the
writer
began
abruptly
-LRB-
without
the
usual
*NL*
preliminaries
-RRB-
,
``
the
day
after
I
saw
you
at
the
play
,
and
these
kind
*NL*
friends
have
taken
me
in
.
I
wanted
to
be
quiet
,
and
think
things
over
.
*NL*
You
were
right
in
telling
me
how
kind
they
were
;
I
feel
myself
so
safe
*NL*
here
.
I
wish
that
you
were
with
us
.
''
She
ended
with
a
conventional
*NL*
``
Yours
sincerely
,
''
and
without
any
allusion
to
the
date
of
her
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
of
the
note
surprised
the
young
man
.
What
was
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
running
away
from
,
and
why
did
she
feel
the
need
to
be
safe
?
His
first
*NL*
thought
was
of
some
dark
menace
from
abroad
;
then
he
reflected
that
he
*NL*
did
not
know
her
epistolary
style
,
and
that
it
might
run
to
picturesque
*NL*
exaggeration
.
Women
always
exaggerated
;
and
moreover
she
was
not
*NL*
wholly
at
her
ease
in
English
,
which
she
often
spoke
as
if
she
were
*NL*
translating
from
the
French
.
``
Je
me
suis
evadee
--
''
put
in
that
way
,
*NL*
the
opening
sentence
immediately
suggested
that
she
might
merely
have
*NL*
wanted
to
escape
from
a
boring
round
of
engagements
;
which
was
very
*NL*
likely
true
,
for
he
judged
her
to
be
capricious
,
and
easily
wearied
of
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
amused
him
to
think
of
the
van
der
Luydens
'
having
carried
her
off
*NL*
to
Skuytercliff
on
a
second
visit
,
and
this
time
for
an
indefinite
*NL*
period
.
The
doors
of
Skuytercliff
were
rarely
and
grudgingly
opened
to
*NL*
visitors
,
and
a
chilly
week-end
was
the
most
ever
offered
to
the
few
*NL*
thus
privileged
.
But
Archer
had
seen
,
on
his
last
visit
to
Paris
,
the
*NL*
delicious
play
of
Labiche
,
``
Le
Voyage
de
M.
Perrichon
,
''
and
he
*NL*
remembered
M.
Perrichon
's
dogged
and
undiscouraged
attachment
to
the
*NL*
young
man
whom
he
had
pulled
out
of
the
glacier
.
The
van
der
Luydens
*NL*
had
rescued
Madame
Olenska
from
a
doom
almost
as
icy
;
and
though
there
*NL*
were
many
other
reasons
for
being
attracted
to
her
,
Archer
knew
that
*NL*
beneath
them
all
lay
the
gentle
and
obstinate
determination
to
go
on
*NL*
rescuing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
a
distinct
disappointment
on
learning
that
she
was
away
;
and
*NL*
almost
immediately
remembered
that
,
only
the
day
before
,
he
had
refused
*NL*
an
invitation
to
spend
the
following
Sunday
with
the
Reggie
Chiverses
*NL*
at
their
house
on
the
Hudson
,
a
few
miles
below
Skuytercliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
his
fill
long
ago
of
the
noisy
friendly
parties
at
Highbank
,
*NL*
with
coasting
,
ice-boating
,
sleighing
,
long
tramps
in
the
snow
,
and
a
*NL*
general
flavour
of
mild
flirting
and
milder
practical
jokes
.
He
had
*NL*
just
received
a
box
of
new
books
from
his
London
book-seller
,
and
had
*NL*
preferred
the
prospect
of
a
quiet
Sunday
at
home
with
his
spoils
.
But
*NL*
he
now
went
into
the
club
writing-room
,
wrote
a
hurried
telegram
,
and
*NL*
told
the
servant
to
send
it
immediately
.
He
knew
that
Mrs.
Reggie
*NL*
did
n't
object
to
her
visitors
'
suddenly
changing
their
minds
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
always
a
room
to
spare
in
her
elastic
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
arrived
at
the
Chiverses
'
on
Friday
evening
,
and
on
*NL*
Saturday
went
conscientiously
through
all
the
rites
appertaining
to
a
*NL*
week-end
at
Highbank
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
had
a
spin
in
the
ice-boat
with
his
hostess
and
a
few
*NL*
of
the
hardier
guests
;
in
the
afternoon
he
``
went
over
the
farm
''
with
*NL*
Reggie
,
and
listened
,
in
the
elaborately
appointed
stables
,
to
long
and
*NL*
impressive
disquisitions
on
the
horse
;
after
tea
he
talked
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
firelit
hall
with
a
young
lady
who
had
professed
herself
*NL*
broken-hearted
when
his
engagement
was
announced
,
but
was
now
eager
to
*NL*
tell
him
of
her
own
matrimonial
hopes
;
and
finally
,
about
midnight
,
he
*NL*
assisted
in
putting
a
gold-fish
in
one
visitor
's
bed
,
dressed
up
a
*NL*
burglar
in
the
bath-room
of
a
nervous
aunt
,
and
saw
in
the
small
hours
*NL*
by
joining
in
a
pillow-fight
that
ranged
from
the
nurseries
to
the
*NL*
basement
.
But
on
Sunday
after
luncheon
he
borrowed
a
cutter
,
and
drove
*NL*
over
to
Skuytercliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
had
always
been
told
that
the
house
at
Skuytercliff
was
an
*NL*
Italian
villa
.
Those
who
had
never
been
to
Italy
believed
it
;
so
did
*NL*
some
who
had
.
The
house
had
been
built
by
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
in
his
*NL*
youth
,
on
his
return
from
the
``
grand
tour
,
''
and
in
anticipation
of
his
*NL*
approaching
marriage
with
Miss
Louisa
Dagonet
.
It
was
a
large
square
*NL*
wooden
structure
,
with
tongued
and
grooved
walls
painted
pale
green
and
*NL*
white
,
a
Corinthian
portico
,
and
fluted
pilasters
between
the
windows
.
*NL*
From
the
high
ground
on
which
it
stood
a
series
of
terraces
bordered
by
*NL*
balustrades
and
urns
descended
in
the
steel-engraving
style
to
a
small
*NL*
irregular
lake
with
an
asphalt
edge
overhung
by
rare
weeping
conifers
.
*NL*
To
the
right
and
left
,
the
famous
weedless
lawns
studded
with
*NL*
``
specimen
''
trees
-LRB-
each
of
a
different
variety
-RRB-
rolled
away
to
long
*NL*
ranges
of
grass
crested
with
elaborate
cast-iron
ornaments
;
and
below
,
*NL*
in
a
hollow
,
lay
the
four-roomed
stone
house
which
the
first
Patroon
*NL*
had
built
on
the
land
granted
him
in
1612
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
the
uniform
sheet
of
snow
and
the
greyish
winter
sky
the
*NL*
Italian
villa
loomed
up
rather
grimly
;
even
in
summer
it
kept
its
*NL*
distance
,
and
the
boldest
coleus
bed
had
never
ventured
nearer
than
*NL*
thirty
feet
from
its
awful
front
.
Now
,
as
Archer
rang
the
bell
,
the
*NL*
long
tinkle
seemed
to
echo
through
a
mausoleum
;
and
the
surprise
of
the
*NL*
butler
who
at
length
responded
to
the
call
was
as
great
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
summoned
from
his
final
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
Archer
was
of
the
family
,
and
therefore
,
irregular
though
his
*NL*
arrival
was
,
entitled
to
be
informed
that
the
Countess
Olenska
was
out
,
*NL*
having
driven
to
afternoon
service
with
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
exactly
*NL*
three
quarters
of
an
hour
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
,
''
the
butler
continued
,
``
is
in
,
sir
;
but
my
*NL*
impression
is
that
he
is
either
finishing
his
nap
or
else
reading
*NL*
yesterday
's
Evening
Post
.
I
heard
him
say
,
sir
,
on
his
return
from
*NL*
church
this
morning
,
that
he
intended
to
look
through
the
Evening
Post
*NL*
after
luncheon
;
if
you
like
,
sir
,
I
might
go
to
the
library
door
and
*NL*
listen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Archer
,
thanking
him
,
said
that
he
would
go
and
meet
the
ladies
;
*NL*
and
the
butler
,
obviously
relieved
,
closed
the
door
on
him
majestically
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
groom
took
the
cutter
to
the
stables
,
and
Archer
struck
through
the
*NL*
park
to
the
high-road
.
The
village
of
Skuytercliff
was
only
a
mile
and
*NL*
a
half
away
,
but
he
knew
that
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
never
walked
,
and
*NL*
that
he
must
keep
to
the
road
to
meet
the
carriage
.
Presently
,
*NL*
however
,
coming
down
a
foot-path
that
crossed
the
highway
,
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
a
slight
figure
in
a
red
cloak
,
with
a
big
dog
running
ahead
.
*NL*
He
hurried
forward
,
and
Madame
Olenska
stopped
short
with
a
smile
of
*NL*
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
've
come
!
''
she
said
,
and
drew
her
hand
from
her
muff
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
cloak
made
her
look
gay
and
vivid
,
like
the
Ellen
Mingott
of
*NL*
old
days
;
and
he
laughed
as
he
took
her
hand
,
and
answered
:
``
I
came
to
*NL*
see
what
you
were
running
away
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
clouded
over
,
but
she
answered
:
``
Ah
,
well
--
you
will
see
,
*NL*
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
puzzled
him
.
``
Why
--
do
you
mean
that
you
've
been
overtaken
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
with
a
little
movement
like
Nastasia
's
,
and
*NL*
rejoined
in
a
lighter
tone
:
``
Shall
we
walk
on
?
I
'm
so
cold
after
the
*NL*
sermon
.
And
what
does
it
matter
,
now
you
're
here
to
protect
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rose
to
his
temples
and
he
caught
a
fold
of
her
cloak
.
*NL*
``
Ellen
--
what
is
it
?
You
must
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
presently
--
let
's
run
a
race
first
:
my
feet
are
freezing
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
''
she
cried
;
and
gathering
up
the
cloak
she
fled
away
across
the
*NL*
snow
,
the
dog
leaping
about
her
with
challenging
barks
.
For
a
moment
*NL*
Archer
stood
watching
,
his
gaze
delighted
by
the
flash
of
the
red
*NL*
meteor
against
the
snow
;
then
he
started
after
her
,
and
they
met
,
*NL*
panting
and
laughing
,
at
a
wicket
that
led
into
the
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
.
``
I
knew
you
'd
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shows
you
wanted
me
to
,
''
he
returned
,
with
a
disproportionate
joy
*NL*
in
their
nonsense
.
The
white
glitter
of
the
trees
filled
the
air
with
*NL*
its
own
mysterious
brightness
,
and
as
they
walked
on
over
the
snow
the
*NL*
ground
seemed
to
sing
under
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
come
from
?
''
Madame
Olenska
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
,
and
added
:
``
It
was
because
I
got
your
note
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
she
said
,
with
a
just
perceptible
chill
in
her
voice
:
*NL*
``
May
asked
you
to
take
care
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
need
any
asking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
--
I
'm
so
evidently
helpless
and
defenceless
?
What
a
poor
*NL*
thing
you
must
all
think
me
!
But
women
here
seem
not
--
seem
never
to
*NL*
feel
the
need
:
any
more
than
the
blessed
in
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
voice
to
ask
:
``
What
sort
of
a
need
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
ask
me
!
I
do
n't
speak
your
language
,
''
she
retorted
*NL*
petulantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
smote
him
like
a
blow
,
and
he
stood
still
in
the
path
,
*NL*
looking
down
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
come
for
,
if
I
do
n't
speak
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
friend
--
!
''
She
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
his
arm
,
and
he
*NL*
pleaded
earnestly
:
``
Ellen
--
why
wo
n't
you
tell
me
what
's
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrugged
again
.
``
Does
anything
ever
happen
in
heaven
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
,
and
they
walked
on
a
few
yards
without
exchanging
a
*NL*
word
.
Finally
she
said
:
``
I
will
tell
you
--
but
where
,
where
,
where
?
*NL*
One
ca
n't
be
alone
for
a
minute
in
that
great
seminary
of
a
house
,
with
*NL*
all
the
doors
wide
open
,
and
always
a
servant
bringing
tea
,
or
a
log
*NL*
for
the
fire
,
or
the
newspaper
!
Is
there
nowhere
in
an
American
house
*NL*
where
one
may
be
by
one
's
self
?
You
're
so
shy
,
and
yet
you
're
so
*NL*
public
.
I
always
feel
as
if
I
were
in
the
convent
again
--
or
on
the
*NL*
stage
,
before
a
dreadfully
polite
audience
that
never
applauds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
like
us
!
''
Archer
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
walking
past
the
house
of
the
old
Patroon
,
with
its
squat
*NL*
walls
and
small
square
windows
compactly
grouped
about
a
central
*NL*
chimney
.
The
shutters
stood
wide
,
and
through
one
of
the
newly-washed
*NL*
windows
Archer
caught
the
light
of
a
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
the
house
is
open
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
still
.
``
No
;
only
for
today
,
at
least
.
I
wanted
to
see
it
,
*NL*
and
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
had
the
fire
lit
and
the
windows
opened
,
so
that
*NL*
we
might
stop
there
on
the
way
back
from
church
this
morning
.
''
She
ran
*NL*
up
the
steps
and
tried
the
door
.
``
It
's
still
unlocked
--
what
luck
!
*NL*
Come
in
and
we
can
have
a
quiet
talk
.
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
has
driven
*NL*
over
to
see
her
old
aunts
at
Rhinebeck
and
we
sha
n't
be
missed
at
the
*NL*
house
for
another
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
her
into
the
narrow
passage
.
His
spirits
,
which
had
*NL*
dropped
at
her
last
words
,
rose
with
an
irrational
leap
.
The
homely
*NL*
little
house
stood
there
,
its
panels
and
brasses
shining
in
the
*NL*
firelight
,
as
if
magically
created
to
receive
them
.
A
big
bed
of
*NL*
embers
still
gleamed
in
the
kitchen
chimney
,
under
an
iron
pot
hung
*NL*
from
an
ancient
crane
.
Rush-bottomed
arm-chairs
faced
each
other
*NL*
across
the
tiled
hearth
,
and
rows
of
Delft
plates
stood
on
shelves
*NL*
against
the
walls
.
Archer
stooped
over
and
threw
a
log
upon
the
embers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
,
dropping
her
cloak
,
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
.
*NL*
Archer
leaned
against
the
chimney
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
laughing
now
;
but
when
you
wrote
me
you
were
unhappy
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
She
paused
.
``
But
I
ca
n't
feel
unhappy
when
you
're
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
'n'
t
be
here
long
,
''
he
rejoined
,
his
lips
stiffening
with
the
*NL*
effort
to
say
just
so
much
and
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
know
.
But
I
'm
improvident
:
I
live
in
the
moment
when
I
'm
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
stole
through
him
like
a
temptation
,
and
to
close
his
senses
*NL*
to
it
he
moved
away
from
the
hearth
and
stood
gazing
out
at
the
black
*NL*
tree-boles
against
the
snow
.
But
it
was
as
if
she
too
had
shifted
her
*NL*
place
,
and
he
still
saw
her
,
between
himself
and
the
trees
,
drooping
*NL*
over
the
fire
with
her
indolent
smile
.
Archer
's
heart
was
beating
*NL*
insubordinately
.
What
if
it
were
from
him
that
she
had
been
running
*NL*
away
,
and
if
she
had
waited
to
tell
him
so
till
they
were
here
alone
*NL*
together
in
this
secret
room
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
,
if
I
'm
really
a
help
to
you
--
if
you
really
wanted
me
to
*NL*
come
--
tell
me
what
's
wrong
,
tell
me
what
it
is
you
're
running
away
*NL*
from
,
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
without
shifting
his
position
,
without
even
turning
to
look
at
*NL*
her
:
if
the
thing
was
to
happen
,
it
was
to
happen
in
this
way
,
with
the
*NL*
whole
width
of
the
room
between
them
,
and
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
*NL*
outer
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
moment
she
was
silent
;
and
in
that
moment
Archer
imagined
*NL*
her
,
almost
heard
her
,
stealing
up
behind
him
to
throw
her
light
arms
*NL*
about
his
neck
.
While
he
waited
,
soul
and
body
throbbing
with
the
*NL*
miracle
to
come
,
his
eyes
mechanically
received
the
image
of
a
*NL*
heavily-coated
man
with
his
fur
collar
turned
up
who
was
advancing
*NL*
along
the
path
to
the
house
.
The
man
was
Julius
Beaufort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
!
''
Archer
cried
,
bursting
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
had
sprung
up
and
moved
to
his
side
,
slipping
her
hand
*NL*
into
his
;
but
after
a
glance
through
the
window
her
face
paled
and
she
*NL*
shrank
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
was
it
?
''
Archer
said
derisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
he
was
here
,
''
Madame
Olenska
murmured
.
Her
hand
still
*NL*
clung
to
Archer
's
;
but
he
drew
away
from
her
,
and
walking
out
into
the
*NL*
passage
threw
open
the
door
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Beaufort
--
this
way
!
Madame
Olenska
was
expecting
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
journey
back
to
New
York
the
next
morning
,
Archer
relived
*NL*
with
a
fatiguing
vividness
his
last
moments
at
Skuytercliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
,
though
clearly
annoyed
at
finding
him
with
Madame
Olenska
,
*NL*
had
,
as
usual
,
carried
off
the
situation
high-handedly
.
His
way
of
*NL*
ignoring
people
whose
presence
inconvenienced
him
actually
gave
them
,
*NL*
if
they
were
sensitive
to
it
,
a
feeling
of
invisibility
,
of
*NL*
nonexistence
.
Archer
,
as
the
three
strolled
back
through
the
park
,
was
*NL*
aware
of
this
odd
sense
of
disembodiment
;
and
humbling
as
it
was
to
his
*NL*
vanity
it
gave
him
the
ghostly
advantage
of
observing
unobserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
had
entered
the
little
house
with
his
usual
easy
assurance
;
*NL*
but
he
could
not
smile
away
the
vertical
line
between
his
eyes
.
It
was
*NL*
fairly
clear
that
Madame
Olenska
had
not
known
that
he
was
coming
,
*NL*
though
her
words
to
Archer
had
hinted
at
the
possibility
;
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
she
had
evidently
not
told
him
where
she
was
going
when
she
left
New
*NL*
York
,
and
her
unexplained
departure
had
exasperated
him
.
The
*NL*
ostensible
reason
of
his
appearance
was
the
discovery
,
the
very
night
*NL*
before
,
of
a
``
perfect
little
house
,
''
not
in
the
market
,
which
was
*NL*
really
just
the
thing
for
her
,
but
would
be
snapped
up
instantly
if
she
*NL*
did
n't
take
it
;
and
he
was
loud
in
mock-reproaches
for
the
dance
she
*NL*
had
led
him
in
running
away
just
as
he
had
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
this
new
dodge
for
talking
along
a
wire
had
been
a
little
bit
*NL*
nearer
perfection
I
might
have
told
you
all
this
from
town
,
and
been
*NL*
toasting
my
toes
before
the
club
fire
at
this
minute
,
instead
of
*NL*
tramping
after
you
through
the
snow
,
''
he
grumbled
,
disguising
a
real
*NL*
irritation
under
the
pretence
of
it
;
and
at
this
opening
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
twisted
the
talk
away
to
the
fantastic
possibility
that
they
might
one
*NL*
day
actually
converse
with
each
other
from
street
to
street
,
or
*NL*
even
--
incredible
dream
!
--
from
one
town
to
another
.
This
struck
from
*NL*
all
three
allusions
to
Edgar
Poe
and
Jules
Verne
,
and
such
platitudes
*NL*
as
naturally
rise
to
the
lips
of
the
most
intelligent
when
they
are
*NL*
talking
against
time
,
and
dealing
with
a
new
invention
in
which
it
*NL*
would
seem
ingenuous
to
believe
too
soon
;
and
the
question
of
the
*NL*
telephone
carried
them
safely
back
to
the
big
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
had
not
yet
returned
;
and
Archer
took
his
leave
and
*NL*
walked
off
to
fetch
the
cutter
,
while
Beaufort
followed
the
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
indoors
.
It
was
probable
that
,
little
as
the
van
der
Luydens
*NL*
encouraged
unannounced
visits
,
he
could
count
on
being
asked
to
dine
,
*NL*
and
sent
back
to
the
station
to
catch
the
nine
o'clock
train
;
but
more
*NL*
than
that
he
would
certainly
not
get
,
for
it
would
be
inconceivable
to
*NL*
his
hosts
that
a
gentleman
travelling
without
luggage
should
wish
to
*NL*
spend
the
night
,
and
distasteful
to
them
to
propose
it
to
a
person
with
*NL*
whom
they
were
on
terms
of
such
limited
cordiality
as
Beaufort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaufort
knew
all
this
,
and
must
have
foreseen
it
;
and
his
taking
the
*NL*
long
journey
for
so
small
a
reward
gave
the
measure
of
his
impatience
.
*NL*
He
was
undeniably
in
pursuit
of
the
Countess
Olenska
;
and
Beaufort
had
*NL*
only
one
object
in
view
in
his
pursuit
of
pretty
women
.
His
dull
and
*NL*
childless
home
had
long
since
palled
on
him
;
and
in
addition
to
more
*NL*
permanent
consolations
he
was
always
in
quest
of
amorous
adventures
in
*NL*
his
own
set
.
This
was
the
man
from
whom
Madame
Olenska
was
avowedly
*NL*
flying
:
the
question
was
whether
she
had
fled
because
his
importunities
*NL*
displeased
her
,
or
because
she
did
not
wholly
trust
herself
to
resist
*NL*
them
;
unless
,
indeed
,
all
her
talk
of
flight
had
been
a
blind
,
and
her
*NL*
departure
no
more
than
a
manoeuvre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
did
not
really
believe
this
.
Little
as
he
had
actually
seen
of
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
,
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
could
read
her
face
,
*NL*
and
if
not
her
face
,
her
voice
;
and
both
had
betrayed
annoyance
,
and
*NL*
even
dismay
,
at
Beaufort
's
sudden
appearance
.
But
,
after
all
,
if
this
*NL*
were
the
case
,
was
it
not
worse
than
if
she
had
left
New
York
for
the
*NL*
express
purpose
of
meeting
him
?
If
she
had
done
that
,
she
ceased
to
be
*NL*
an
object
of
interest
,
she
threw
in
her
lot
with
the
vulgarest
of
*NL*
dissemblers
:
a
woman
engaged
in
a
love
affair
with
Beaufort
``
classed
''
*NL*
herself
irretrievably
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
it
was
worse
a
thousand
times
if
,
judging
Beaufort
,
and
probably
*NL*
despising
him
,
she
was
yet
drawn
to
him
by
all
that
gave
him
an
*NL*
advantage
over
the
other
men
about
her
:
his
habit
of
two
continents
and
*NL*
two
societies
,
his
familiar
association
with
artists
and
actors
and
*NL*
people
generally
in
the
world
's
eye
,
and
his
careless
contempt
for
*NL*
local
prejudices
.
Beaufort
was
vulgar
,
he
was
uneducated
,
he
was
*NL*
purse-proud
;
but
the
circumstances
of
his
life
,
and
a
certain
native
*NL*
shrewdness
,
made
him
better
worth
talking
to
than
many
men
,
morally
and
*NL*
socially
his
betters
,
whose
horizon
was
bounded
by
the
Battery
and
the
*NL*
Central
Park
.
How
should
any
one
coming
from
a
wider
world
not
feel
*NL*
the
difference
and
be
attracted
by
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
,
in
a
burst
of
irritation
,
had
said
to
Archer
that
he
*NL*
and
she
did
not
talk
the
same
language
;
and
the
young
man
knew
that
in
*NL*
some
respects
this
was
true
.
But
Beaufort
understood
every
turn
of
her
*NL*
dialect
,
and
spoke
it
fluently
:
his
view
of
life
,
his
tone
,
his
*NL*
attitude
,
were
merely
a
coarser
reflection
of
those
revealed
in
Count
*NL*
Olenski
's
letter
.
This
might
seem
to
be
to
his
disadvantage
with
Count
*NL*
Olenski
's
wife
;
but
Archer
was
too
intelligent
to
think
that
a
young
*NL*
woman
like
Ellen
Olenska
would
necessarily
recoil
from
everything
that
*NL*
reminded
her
of
her
past
.
She
might
believe
herself
wholly
in
revolt
*NL*
against
it
;
but
what
had
charmed
her
in
it
would
still
charm
her
,
even
*NL*
though
it
were
against
her
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
with
a
painful
impartiality
,
did
the
young
man
make
out
the
case
*NL*
for
Beaufort
,
and
for
Beaufort
's
victim
.
A
longing
to
enlighten
her
*NL*
was
strong
in
him
;
and
there
were
moments
when
he
imagined
that
all
she
*NL*
asked
was
to
be
enlightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
he
unpacked
his
books
from
London
.
The
box
was
full
of
*NL*
things
he
had
been
waiting
for
impatiently
;
a
new
volume
of
Herbert
*NL*
Spencer
,
another
collection
of
the
prolific
Alphonse
Daudet
's
brilliant
*NL*
tales
,
and
a
novel
called
``
Middlemarch
,
''
as
to
which
there
had
lately
*NL*
been
interesting
things
said
in
the
reviews
.
He
had
declined
three
*NL*
dinner
invitations
in
favour
of
this
feast
;
but
though
he
turned
the
*NL*
pages
with
the
sensuous
joy
of
the
book-lover
,
he
did
not
know
what
he
*NL*
was
reading
,
and
one
book
after
another
dropped
from
his
hand
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
among
them
,
he
lit
on
a
small
volume
of
verse
which
he
had
*NL*
ordered
because
the
name
had
attracted
him
:
``
The
House
of
Life
.
''
He
*NL*
took
it
up
,
and
found
himself
plunged
in
an
atmosphere
unlike
any
he
*NL*
had
ever
breathed
in
books
;
so
warm
,
so
rich
,
and
yet
so
ineffably
*NL*
tender
,
that
it
gave
a
new
and
haunting
beauty
to
the
most
elementary
*NL*
of
human
passions
.
All
through
the
night
he
pursued
through
those
*NL*
enchanted
pages
the
vision
of
a
woman
who
had
the
face
of
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
;
but
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
,
and
looked
out
at
the
*NL*
brownstone
houses
across
the
street
,
and
thought
of
his
desk
in
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
's
office
,
and
the
family
pew
in
Grace
Church
,
his
hour
in
*NL*
the
park
of
Skuytercliff
became
as
far
outside
the
pale
of
probability
*NL*
as
the
visions
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
,
how
pale
you
look
,
Newland
!
''
Janey
commented
over
the
*NL*
coffee-cups
at
breakfast
;
and
his
mother
added
:
``
Newland
,
dear
,
I
've
*NL*
noticed
lately
that
you
've
been
coughing
;
I
do
hope
you
're
not
letting
*NL*
yourself
be
overworked
?
''
For
it
was
the
conviction
of
both
ladies
*NL*
that
,
under
the
iron
despotism
of
his
senior
partners
,
the
young
man
's
*NL*
life
was
spent
in
the
most
exhausting
professional
labours
--
and
he
had
*NL*
never
thought
it
necessary
to
undeceive
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
two
or
three
days
dragged
by
heavily
.
The
taste
of
the
usual
*NL*
was
like
cinders
in
his
mouth
,
and
there
were
moments
when
he
felt
as
*NL*
if
he
were
being
buried
alive
under
his
future
.
He
heard
nothing
of
*NL*
the
Countess
Olenska
,
or
of
the
perfect
little
house
,
and
though
he
met
*NL*
Beaufort
at
the
club
they
merely
nodded
at
each
other
across
the
*NL*
whist-tables
.
It
was
not
till
the
fourth
evening
that
he
found
a
note
*NL*
awaiting
him
on
his
return
home
.
``
Come
late
tomorrow
:
I
must
explain
*NL*
to
you
.
Ellen
.
''
These
were
the
only
words
it
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
who
was
dining
out
,
thrust
the
note
into
his
pocket
,
*NL*
smiling
a
little
at
the
Frenchness
of
the
``
to
you
.
''
After
dinner
he
*NL*
went
to
a
play
;
and
it
was
not
until
his
return
home
,
after
midnight
,
*NL*
that
he
drew
Madame
Olenska
's
missive
out
again
and
re-read
it
slowly
a
*NL*
number
of
times
.
There
were
several
ways
of
answering
it
,
and
he
gave
*NL*
considerable
thought
to
each
one
during
the
watches
of
an
agitated
*NL*
night
.
That
on
which
,
when
morning
came
,
he
finally
decided
was
to
*NL*
pitch
some
clothes
into
a
portmanteau
and
jump
on
board
a
boat
that
was
*NL*
leaving
that
very
afternoon
for
St.
Augustine
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Archer
walked
down
the
sandy
main
street
of
St.
Augustine
to
the
*NL*
house
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
as
Mr.
Welland
's
,
and
saw
May
*NL*
Welland
standing
under
a
magnolia
with
the
sun
in
her
hair
,
he
wondered
*NL*
why
he
had
waited
so
long
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
the
truth
,
here
was
reality
,
here
was
the
life
that
belonged
*NL*
to
him
;
and
he
,
who
fancied
himself
so
scornful
of
arbitrary
*NL*
restraints
,
had
been
afraid
to
break
away
from
his
desk
because
of
what
*NL*
people
might
think
of
his
stealing
a
holiday
!
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
exclamation
was
:
``
Newland
--
has
anything
happened
?
''
and
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
it
would
have
been
more
``
feminine
''
if
she
had
*NL*
instantly
read
in
his
eyes
why
he
had
come
.
But
when
he
answered
:
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
found
I
had
to
see
you
,
''
her
happy
blushes
took
the
chill
from
*NL*
her
surprise
,
and
he
saw
how
easily
he
would
be
forgiven
,
and
how
soon
*NL*
even
Mr.
Letterblair
's
mild
disapproval
would
be
smiled
away
by
a
*NL*
tolerant
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
as
it
was
,
the
main
street
was
no
place
for
any
but
formal
*NL*
greetings
,
and
Archer
longed
to
be
alone
with
May
,
and
to
pour
out
all
*NL*
his
tenderness
and
his
impatience
.
It
still
lacked
an
hour
to
the
late
*NL*
Welland
breakfast-time
,
and
instead
of
asking
him
to
come
in
she
*NL*
proposed
that
they
should
walk
out
to
an
old
orange-garden
beyond
the
*NL*
town
.
She
had
just
been
for
a
row
on
the
river
,
and
the
sun
that
*NL*
netted
the
little
waves
with
gold
seemed
to
have
caught
her
in
its
*NL*
meshes
.
Across
the
warm
brown
of
her
cheek
her
blown
hair
glittered
*NL*
like
silver
wire
;
and
her
eyes
too
looked
lighter
,
almost
pale
in
their
*NL*
youthful
limpidity
.
As
she
walked
beside
Archer
with
her
long
swinging
*NL*
gait
her
face
wore
the
vacant
serenity
of
a
young
marble
athlete
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Archer
's
strained
nerves
the
vision
was
as
soothing
as
the
sight
of
*NL*
the
blue
sky
and
the
lazy
river
.
They
sat
down
on
a
bench
under
the
*NL*
orange-trees
and
he
put
his
arm
about
her
and
kissed
her
.
It
was
like
*NL*
drinking
at
a
cold
spring
with
the
sun
on
it
;
but
his
pressure
may
have
*NL*
been
more
vehement
than
he
had
intended
,
for
the
blood
rose
to
her
face
*NL*
and
she
drew
back
as
if
he
had
startled
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
smiling
;
and
she
looked
at
him
with
surprise
,
*NL*
and
answered
:
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
embarrassment
fell
on
them
,
and
her
hand
slipped
out
of
his
.
*NL*
It
was
the
only
time
that
he
had
kissed
her
on
the
lips
except
for
*NL*
their
fugitive
embrace
in
the
Beaufort
conservatory
,
and
he
saw
that
*NL*
she
was
disturbed
,
and
shaken
out
of
her
cool
boyish
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
what
you
do
all
day
,
''
he
said
,
crossing
his
arms
under
his
*NL*
tilted-back
head
,
and
pushing
his
hat
forward
to
screen
the
sun-dazzle
.
*NL*
To
let
her
talk
about
familiar
and
simple
things
was
the
easiest
way
of
*NL*
carrying
on
his
own
independent
train
of
thought
;
and
he
sat
listening
*NL*
to
her
simple
chronicle
of
swimming
,
sailing
and
riding
,
varied
by
an
*NL*
occasional
dance
at
the
primitive
inn
when
a
man-of-war
came
in
.
A
few
*NL*
pleasant
people
from
Philadelphia
and
Baltimore
were
picknicking
at
the
*NL*
inn
,
and
the
Selfridge
Merrys
had
come
down
for
three
weeks
because
*NL*
Kate
Merry
had
had
bronchitis
.
They
were
planning
to
lay
out
a
lawn
*NL*
tennis
court
on
the
sands
;
but
no
one
but
Kate
and
May
had
racquets
,
*NL*
and
most
of
the
people
had
not
even
heard
of
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
kept
her
very
busy
,
and
she
had
not
had
time
to
do
more
than
*NL*
look
at
the
little
vellum
book
that
Archer
had
sent
her
the
week
before
*NL*
-LRB-
the
``
Sonnets
from
the
Portuguese
''
-RRB-
;
but
she
was
learning
by
heart
``
How
*NL*
they
brought
the
Good
News
from
Ghent
to
Aix
,
''
because
it
was
one
of
*NL*
the
first
things
he
had
ever
read
to
her
;
and
it
amused
her
to
be
able
*NL*
to
tell
him
that
Kate
Merry
had
never
even
heard
of
a
poet
called
*NL*
Robert
Browning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
started
up
,
exclaiming
that
they
would
be
late
for
*NL*
breakfast
;
and
they
hurried
back
to
the
tumble-down
house
with
its
*NL*
pointless
porch
and
unpruned
hedge
of
plumbago
and
pink
geraniums
where
*NL*
the
Wellands
were
installed
for
the
winter
.
Mr.
Welland
's
sensitive
*NL*
domesticity
shrank
from
the
discomforts
of
the
slovenly
southern
hotel
,
*NL*
and
at
immense
expense
,
and
in
face
of
almost
insuperable
difficulties
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
was
obliged
,
year
after
year
,
to
improvise
an
*NL*
establishment
partly
made
up
of
discontented
New
York
servants
and
*NL*
partly
drawn
from
the
local
African
supply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctors
want
my
husband
to
feel
that
he
is
in
his
own
home
;
*NL*
otherwise
he
would
be
so
wretched
that
the
climate
would
not
do
him
any
*NL*
good
,
''
she
explained
,
winter
after
winter
,
to
the
sympathising
*NL*
Philadelphians
and
Baltimoreans
;
and
Mr.
Welland
,
beaming
across
a
*NL*
breakfast
table
miraculously
supplied
with
the
most
varied
delicacies
,
*NL*
was
presently
saying
to
Archer
:
``
You
see
,
my
dear
fellow
,
we
camp
--
we
*NL*
literally
camp
.
I
tell
my
wife
and
May
that
I
want
to
teach
them
how
*NL*
to
rough
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Welland
had
been
as
much
surprised
as
their
daughter
by
*NL*
the
young
man
's
sudden
arrival
;
but
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
explain
*NL*
that
he
had
felt
himself
on
the
verge
of
a
nasty
cold
,
and
this
seemed
*NL*
to
Mr.
Welland
an
all-sufficient
reason
for
abandoning
any
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
be
too
careful
,
especially
toward
spring
,
''
he
said
,
heaping
*NL*
his
plate
with
straw-coloured
griddle-cakes
and
drowning
them
in
golden
*NL*
syrup
.
``
If
I
'd
only
been
as
prudent
at
your
age
May
would
have
been
*NL*
dancing
at
the
Assemblies
now
,
instead
of
spending
her
winters
in
a
*NL*
wilderness
with
an
old
invalid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
love
it
here
,
Papa
;
you
know
I
do
.
If
only
Newland
could
*NL*
stay
I
should
like
it
a
thousand
times
better
than
New
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
must
stay
till
he
has
quite
thrown
off
his
cold
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
indulgently
;
and
the
young
man
laughed
,
and
said
he
supposed
*NL*
there
was
such
a
thing
as
one
's
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
managed
,
however
,
after
an
exchange
of
telegrams
with
the
firm
,
to
*NL*
make
his
cold
last
a
week
;
and
it
shed
an
ironic
light
on
the
situation
*NL*
to
know
that
Mr.
Letterblair
's
indulgence
was
partly
due
to
the
*NL*
satisfactory
way
in
which
his
brilliant
young
junior
partner
had
*NL*
settled
the
troublesome
matter
of
the
Olenski
divorce
.
Mr.
Letterblair
*NL*
had
let
Mrs.
Welland
know
that
Mr.
Archer
had
``
rendered
an
invaluable
*NL*
service
''
to
the
whole
family
,
and
that
old
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
had
been
*NL*
particularly
pleased
;
and
one
day
when
May
had
gone
for
a
drive
with
*NL*
her
father
in
the
only
vehicle
the
place
produced
Mrs.
Welland
took
*NL*
occasion
to
touch
on
a
topic
which
she
always
avoided
in
her
daughter
's
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
Ellen
's
ideas
are
not
at
all
like
ours
.
She
was
barely
*NL*
eighteen
when
Medora
Manson
took
her
back
to
Europe
--
you
remember
the
*NL*
excitement
when
she
appeared
in
black
at
her
coming-out
ball
?
Another
*NL*
of
Medora
's
fads
--
really
this
time
it
was
almost
prophetic
!
That
must
*NL*
have
been
at
least
twelve
years
ago
;
and
since
then
Ellen
has
never
*NL*
been
to
America
.
No
wonder
she
is
completely
Europeanised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
European
society
is
not
given
to
divorce
:
Countess
Olenska
thought
*NL*
she
would
be
conforming
to
American
ideas
in
asking
for
her
freedom
.
''
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
that
the
young
man
had
pronounced
her
name
since
*NL*
he
had
left
Skuytercliff
,
and
he
felt
the
colour
rise
to
his
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
smiled
compassionately
.
``
That
is
just
like
the
*NL*
extraordinary
things
that
foreigners
invent
about
us
.
They
think
we
*NL*
dine
at
two
o'clock
and
countenance
divorce
!
That
is
why
it
seems
to
*NL*
me
so
foolish
to
entertain
them
when
they
come
to
New
York
.
They
*NL*
accept
our
hospitality
,
and
then
they
go
home
and
repeat
the
same
*NL*
stupid
stories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
made
no
comment
on
this
,
and
Mrs.
Welland
continued
:
``
But
we
do
*NL*
most
thoroughly
appreciate
your
persuading
Ellen
to
give
up
the
idea
.
*NL*
Her
grandmother
and
her
uncle
Lovell
could
do
nothing
with
her
;
both
of
*NL*
them
have
written
that
her
changing
her
mind
was
entirely
due
to
your
*NL*
influence
--
in
fact
she
said
so
to
her
grandmother
.
She
has
an
*NL*
unbounded
admiration
for
you
.
Poor
Ellen
--
she
was
always
a
wayward
*NL*
child
.
I
wonder
what
her
fate
will
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
we
've
all
contrived
to
make
it
,
''
he
felt
like
answering
.
``
If
*NL*
you
'd
all
of
you
rather
she
should
be
Beaufort
's
mistress
than
some
*NL*
decent
fellow
's
wife
you
've
certainly
gone
the
right
way
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
what
Mrs.
Welland
would
have
said
if
he
had
uttered
the
*NL*
words
instead
of
merely
thinking
them
.
He
could
picture
the
sudden
*NL*
decomposure
of
her
firm
placid
features
,
to
which
a
lifelong
mastery
*NL*
over
trifles
had
given
an
air
of
factitious
authority
.
Traces
still
*NL*
lingered
on
them
of
a
fresh
beauty
like
her
daughter
's
;
and
he
asked
*NL*
himself
if
May
's
face
was
doomed
to
thicken
into
the
same
middle-aged
*NL*
image
of
invincible
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
no
,
he
did
not
want
May
to
have
that
kind
of
innocence
,
the
*NL*
innocence
that
seals
the
mind
against
imagination
and
the
heart
against
*NL*
experience
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
verily
believe

Mrs.
Welland
continued
,
``
that
if
the
horrible
*NL*
business
had
come
out
in
the
newspapers
it
would
have
been
my
husband
's
*NL*
death-blow
.
I
do
n't
know
any
of
the
details
;
I
only
ask
not
to
,
as
I
*NL*
told
poor
Ellen
when
she
tried
to
talk
to
me
about
it
.
Having
an
*NL*
invalid
to
care
for
,
I
have
to
keep
my
mind
bright
and
happy
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Welland
was
terribly
upset
;
he
had
a
slight
temperature
every
morning
*NL*
while
we
were
waiting
to
hear
what
had
been
decided
.
It
was
the
horror
*NL*
of
his
girl
's
learning
that
such
things
were
possible
--
but
of
course
,
*NL*
dear
Newland
,
you
felt
that
too
.
We
all
knew
that
you
were
thinking
of
*NL*
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
always
thinking
of
May
,
''
the
young
man
rejoined
,
rising
to
cut
*NL*
short
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
meant
to
seize
the
opportunity
of
his
private
talk
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
to
urge
her
to
advance
the
date
of
his
marriage
.
But
he
could
*NL*
think
of
no
arguments
that
would
move
her
,
and
with
a
sense
of
relief
*NL*
he
saw
Mr.
Welland
and
May
driving
up
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
only
hope
was
to
plead
again
with
May
,
and
on
the
day
before
his
*NL*
departure
he
walked
with
her
to
the
ruinous
garden
of
the
Spanish
*NL*
Mission
.
The
background
lent
itself
to
allusions
to
European
scenes
;
*NL*
and
May
,
who
was
looking
her
loveliest
under
a
wide-brimmed
hat
that
*NL*
cast
a
shadow
of
mystery
over
her
too-clear
eyes
,
kindled
into
*NL*
eagerness
as
he
spoke
of
Granada
and
the
Alhambra
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
be
seeing
it
all
this
spring
--
even
the
Easter
ceremonies
at
*NL*
Seville
,
''
he
urged
,
exaggerating
his
demands
in
the
hope
of
a
larger
*NL*
concession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Easter
in
Seville
?
And
it
will
be
Lent
next
week
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
we
be
married
in
Lent
?
''
he
rejoined
;
but
she
looked
so
*NL*
shocked
that
he
saw
his
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
did
n't
mean
that
,
dearest
;
but
soon
after
Easter
--
so
that
*NL*
we
could
sail
at
the
end
of
April
.
I
know
I
could
arrange
it
at
the
*NL*
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
dreamily
upon
the
possibility
;
but
he
perceived
that
to
*NL*
dream
of
it
sufficed
her
.
It
was
like
hearing
him
read
aloud
out
of
*NL*
his
poetry
books
the
beautiful
things
that
could
not
possibly
happen
in
*NL*
real
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
go
on
,
Newland
;
I
do
love
your
descriptions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
they
be
only
descriptions
?
Why
should
n't
we
make
them
*NL*
real
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
,
dearest
,
of
course
;
next
year
.
''
Her
voice
lingered
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
them
to
be
real
sooner
?
Ca
n't
I
persuade
you
to
break
*NL*
away
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
,
vanishing
from
him
under
her
conniving
hat-brim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
dream
away
another
year
?
Look
at
me
,
dear
!
Do
n't
you
*NL*
understand
how
I
want
you
for
my
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
remained
motionless
;
then
she
raised
on
him
eyes
of
*NL*
such
despairing
dearness
that
he
half-released
her
waist
from
his
hold
.
*NL*
But
suddenly
her
look
changed
and
deepened
inscrutably
.
``
I
'm
not
sure
*NL*
if
I
DO
understand
,
''
she
said
.
``
Is
it
--
is
it
because
you
're
not
*NL*
certain
of
continuing
to
care
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sprang
up
from
his
seat
.
``
My
God
--
perhaps
--
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
*NL*
broke
out
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
Welland
rose
also
;
as
they
faced
each
other
she
seemed
to
grow
in
*NL*
womanly
stature
and
dignity
.
Both
were
silent
for
a
moment
,
as
if
*NL*
dismayed
by
the
unforeseen
trend
of
their
words
:
then
she
said
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
:
``
If
that
is
it
--
is
there
some
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
else
--
between
you
and
me
?
''
He
echoed
her
words
slowly
,
as
*NL*
though
they
were
only
half-intelligible
and
he
wanted
time
to
repeat
*NL*
the
question
to
himself
.
She
seemed
to
catch
the
uncertainty
of
his
*NL*
voice
,
for
she
went
on
in
a
deepening
tone
:
``
Let
us
talk
frankly
,
*NL*
Newland
.
Sometimes
I
've
felt
a
difference
in
you
;
especially
since
our
*NL*
engagement
has
been
announced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
--
what
madness
!
''
he
recovered
himself
to
exclaim
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
his
protest
with
a
faint
smile
.
``
If
it
is
,
it
wo
n't
hurt
us
to
*NL*
talk
about
it
.
''
She
paused
,
and
added
,
lifting
her
head
with
one
of
*NL*
her
noble
movements
:
``
Or
even
if
it
's
true
:
why
should
n't
we
speak
of
*NL*
it
?
You
might
so
easily
have
made
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
head
,
staring
at
the
black
leaf-pattern
on
the
sunny
*NL*
path
at
their
feet
.
``
Mistakes
are
always
easy
to
make
;
but
if
I
had
*NL*
made
one
of
the
kind
you
suggest
,
is
it
likely
that
I
should
be
*NL*
imploring
you
to
hasten
our
marriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
downward
too
,
disturbing
the
pattern
with
the
point
of
her
*NL*
sunshade
while
she
struggled
for
expression
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
at
*NL*
length
.
``
You
might
want
--
once
for
all
--
to
settle
the
question
:
it
's
*NL*
one
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
quiet
lucidity
startled
him
,
but
did
not
mislead
him
into
thinking
*NL*
her
insensible
.
Under
her
hat-brim
he
saw
the
pallor
of
her
profile
,
*NL*
and
a
slight
tremor
of
the
nostril
above
her
resolutely
steadied
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
?
''
he
questioned
,
sitting
down
on
the
bench
,
and
looking
up
at
*NL*
her
with
a
frown
that
he
tried
to
make
playful
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
back
into
her
seat
and
went
on
:
``
You
must
n't
think
that
a
*NL*
girl
knows
as
little
as
her
parents
imagine
.
One
hears
and
one
*NL*
notices
--
one
has
one
's
feelings
and
ideas
.
And
of
course
,
long
before
*NL*
you
told
me
that
you
cared
for
me
,
I
'd
known
that
there
was
some
one
*NL*
else
you
were
interested
in
;
every
one
was
talking
about
it
two
years
*NL*
ago
at
Newport
.
And
once
I
saw
you
sitting
together
on
the
verandah
at
*NL*
a
dance
--
and
when
she
came
back
into
the
house
her
face
was
sad
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
sorry
for
her
;
I
remembered
it
afterward
,
when
we
were
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
had
sunk
almost
to
a
whisper
,
and
she
sat
clasping
and
*NL*
unclasping
her
hands
about
the
handle
of
her
sunshade
.
The
young
man
*NL*
laid
his
upon
them
with
a
gentle
pressure
;
his
heart
dilated
with
an
*NL*
inexpressible
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
child
--
was
THAT
it
?
If
you
only
knew
the
truth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
head
quickly
.
``
Then
there
is
a
truth
I
do
n't
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
his
hand
over
hers
.
``
I
meant
,
the
truth
about
the
old
story
*NL*
you
speak
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
what
I
want
to
know
,
Newland
--
what
I
ought
to
know
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
have
my
happiness
made
out
of
a
wrong
--
an
unfairness
--
to
*NL*
somebody
else
.
And
I
want
to
believe
that
it
would
be
the
same
with
*NL*
you
.
What
sort
of
a
life
could
we
build
on
such
foundations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
had
taken
on
a
look
of
such
tragic
courage
that
he
felt
like
*NL*
bowing
himself
down
at
her
feet
.
``
I
've
wanted
to
say
this
for
a
long
*NL*
time
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
I
've
wanted
to
tell
you
that
,
when
two
people
*NL*
really
love
each
other
,
I
understand
that
there
may
be
situations
which
*NL*
make
it
right
that
they
should
--
should
go
against
public
opinion
.
And
*NL*
if
you
feel
yourself
in
any
way
pledged
...
pledged
to
the
person
we
've
*NL*
spoken
of
...
and
if
there
is
any
way
...
any
way
in
which
you
can
*NL*
fulfill
your
pledge
...
even
by
her
getting
a
divorce
...
Newland
,
*NL*
do
n't
give
her
up
because
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
surprise
at
discovering
that
her
fears
had
fastened
upon
an
episode
*NL*
so
remote
and
so
completely
of
the
past
as
his
love-affair
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Thorley
Rushworth
gave
way
to
wonder
at
the
generosity
of
her
view
.
*NL*
There
was
something
superhuman
in
an
attitude
so
recklessly
unorthodox
,
*NL*
and
if
other
problems
had
not
pressed
on
him
he
would
have
been
lost
in
*NL*
wonder
at
the
prodigy
of
the
Wellands
'
daughter
urging
him
to
marry
his
*NL*
former
mistress
.
But
he
was
still
dizzy
with
the
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
precipice
they
had
skirted
,
and
full
of
a
new
awe
at
the
mystery
of
*NL*
young-girlhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
could
not
speak
;
then
he
said
:
``
There
is
no
pledge
--
no
*NL*
obligation
whatever
--
of
the
kind
you
think
.
Such
cases
do
n't
*NL*
always
--
present
themselves
quite
as
simply
as
...
But
that
's
no
matter
*NL*
...
I
love
your
generosity
,
because
I
feel
as
you
do
about
those
things
*NL*
...
I
feel
that
each
case
must
be
judged
individually
,
on
its
own
*NL*
merits
...
irrespective
of
stupid
conventionalities
...
I
mean
,
each
*NL*
woman
's
right
to
her
liberty
--
''
He
pulled
himself
up
,
startled
by
the
*NL*
turn
his
thoughts
had
taken
,
and
went
on
,
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
``
Since
you
understand
so
many
things
,
dearest
,
ca
n't
you
go
a
little
*NL*
farther
,
and
understand
the
uselessness
of
our
submitting
to
another
*NL*
form
of
the
same
foolish
conventionalities
?
If
there
's
no
one
and
*NL*
nothing
between
us
,
is
n't
that
an
argument
for
marrying
quickly
,
rather
*NL*
than
for
more
delay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
with
joy
and
lifted
her
face
to
his
;
as
he
bent
to
it
he
*NL*
saw
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
happy
tears
.
But
in
another
moment
she
*NL*
seemed
to
have
descended
from
her
womanly
eminence
to
helpless
and
*NL*
timorous
girlhood
;
and
he
understood
that
her
courage
and
initiative
*NL*
were
all
for
others
,
and
that
she
had
none
for
herself
.
It
was
evident
*NL*
that
the
effort
of
speaking
had
been
much
greater
than
her
studied
*NL*
composure
betrayed
,
and
that
at
his
first
word
of
reassurance
she
had
*NL*
dropped
back
into
the
usual
,
as
a
too-adventurous
child
takes
refuge
in
*NL*
its
mother
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
no
heart
to
go
on
pleading
with
her
;
he
was
too
much
*NL*
disappointed
at
the
vanishing
of
the
new
being
who
had
cast
that
one
*NL*
deep
look
at
him
from
her
transparent
eyes
.
May
seemed
to
be
aware
of
*NL*
his
disappointment
,
but
without
knowing
how
to
alleviate
it
;
and
they
*NL*
stood
up
and
walked
silently
home
.

*NL*
``
Your

Janey

Archer
announced
to
her
brother
on
the
evening
of
his
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
who
was
dining
alone
with
his
mother
and
sister
,
glanced
*NL*
up
in
surprise
and
saw
Mrs.

's
gaze
demurely
bent
on
her
plate

*NL*
Mrs.

did
not
regard
her
seclusion
from
the
world
as
a
reason
for
*NL*
being
forgotten
by
it

and
Newland
guessed
that
she
was
slightly
*NL*
annoyed
that
he
should
be
surprised
by
Madame
Olenska
's
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
on
a
black
velvet
polonaise
with
jet
buttons

green

monkey
muff

never
saw
her
so
stylishly
dressed

Janey
continued
.
*NL*
``
She
came
alone

early
on
Sunday
afternoon
;
luckily
the
fire
was
lit
in

the
drawing-room

She
had
one
of
those

card-cases

She
said

Newland
laughed

``

a

two
after

he
called
on

The
old

received

told
her
that
he
had
deserted
the
office
without
leave
,
and
*NL*
rushed
down
to
St.
Augustine
simply
because
he
wanted
to
see
May
,
she
*NL*
gave
an
adipose
chuckle
and
patted
his
knee
with
her
puff-ball
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
--
so
you
kicked
over
the
traces
,
did
you
?
And
I
suppose
Augusta
*NL*
and
Welland
pulled
long
faces
,
and
behaved
as
if
the
end
of
the
world
*NL*
had
come
?
But
little
May
--
she
knew
better
,
I
'll
be
bound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hoped
she
did
;
but
after
all
she
would
n't
agree
to
what
I
'd
gone
*NL*
down
to
ask
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
she
indeed
?
And
what
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
get
her
to
promise
that
we
should
be
married
in
April
.
*NL*
What
's
the
use
of
our
wasting
another
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
screwed
up
her
little
mouth
into
a
grimace
of
mimic
*NL*
prudery
and
twinkled
at
him
through
malicious
lids
.
''
`
Ask
Mamma
,
'
I
*NL*
suppose
--
the
usual
story
.
Ah
,
these
Mingotts
--
all
alike
!
Born
in
a
*NL*
rut
,
and
you
ca
n't
root
'em
out
of
it
.
When
I
built
this
house
you
'd
*NL*
have
thought
I
was
moving
to
California
!
Nobody
ever
HAD
built
above
*NL*
Fortieth
Street
--
no
,
says
I
,
nor
above
the
Battery
either
,
before
*NL*
Christopher
Columbus
discovered
America
.
No
,
no
;
not
one
of
them
wants
*NL*
to
be
different
;
they
're
as
scared
of
it
as
the
small-pox
.
Ah
,
my
dear
*NL*
Mr.
Archer
,
I
thank
my
stars
I
'm
nothing
but
a
vulgar
Spicer
;
but
*NL*
there
's
not
one
of
my
own
children
that
takes
after
me
but
my
little
*NL*
Ellen
.
''
She
broke
off
,
still
twinkling
at
him
,
and
asked
,
with
the
*NL*
casual
irrelevance
of
old
age
:
``
Now
,
why
in
the
world
did
n't
you
marry
*NL*
my
little
Ellen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
laughed
.
``
For
one
thing
,
she
was
n't
there
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
to
be
sure
;
more
's
the
pity
.
And
now
it
's
too
late
;
her
life
is
*NL*
finished
.
''
She
spoke
with
the
cold-blooded
complacency
of
the
aged
*NL*
throwing
earth
into
the
grave
of
young
hopes
.
The
young
man
's
heart
*NL*
grew
chill
,
and
he
said
hurriedly
:
``
Ca
n't
I
persuade
you
to
use
your
*NL*
influence
with
the
Wellands
,
Mrs.
Mingott
?
I
was
n't
made
for
long
*NL*
engagements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Catherine
beamed
on
him
approvingly
.
``
No
;
I
can
see
that
.
You
've
*NL*
got
a
quick
eye
.
When
you
were
a
little
boy
I
've
no
doubt
you
liked
to
*NL*
be
helped
first
.
''
She
threw
back
her
head
with
a
laugh
that
made
her
*NL*
chins
ripple
like
little
waves
.
``
Ah
,
here
's
my
Ellen
now
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
as
the
portieres
parted
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
came
forward
with
a
smile
.
Her
face
looked
vivid
and
*NL*
happy
,
and
she
held
out
her
hand
gaily
to
Archer
while
she
stooped
to
*NL*
her
grandmother
's
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
saying
to
him
,
my
dear
:
`
Now
,
why
did
n't
you
marry
my
*NL*
little
Ellen
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
looked
at
Archer
,
still
smiling
.
``
And
what
did
he
*NL*
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
darling
,
I
leave
you
to
find
that
out
!
He
's
been
down
to
*NL*
Florida
to
see
his
sweetheart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
.
''
She
still
looked
at
him
.
``
I
went
to
see
your
mother
,
*NL*
to
ask
where
you
'd
gone
.
I
sent
a
note
that
you
never
answered
,
and
I
*NL*
was
afraid
you
were
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
muttered
something
about
leaving
unexpectedly
,
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
*NL*
having
intended
to
write
to
her
from
St.
Augustine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
course
once
you
were
there
you
never
thought
of
me
again
!
''
She
*NL*
continued
to
beam
on
him
with
a
gaiety
that
might
have
been
a
studied
*NL*
assumption
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
still
needs
me
,
she
's
determined
not
to
let
me
see
it
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
stung
by
her
manner
.
He
wanted
to
thank
her
for
having
been
*NL*
to
see
his
mother
,
but
under
the
ancestress
's
malicious
eye
he
felt
*NL*
himself
tongue-tied
and
constrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
him
--
in
such
hot
haste
to
get
married
that
he
took
French
*NL*
leave
and
rushed
down
to
implore
the
silly
girl
on
his
knees
!
That
's
*NL*
something
like
a
lover
--
that
's
the
way
handsome
Bob
Spicer
carried
off
*NL*
my
poor
mother
;
and
then
got
tired
of
her
before
I
was
weaned
--
though
*NL*
they
only
had
to
wait
eight
months
for
me
!
But
there
--
you
're
not
a
*NL*
Spicer
,
young
man
;
luckily
for
you
and
for
May
.
It
's
only
my
poor
*NL*
Ellen
that
has
kept
any
of
their
wicked
blood
;
the
rest
of
them
are
all
*NL*
model
Mingotts
,
''
cried
the
old
lady
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
aware
that
Madame
Olenska
,
who
had
seated
herself
at
her
*NL*
grandmother
's
side
,
was
still
thoughtfully
scrutinising
him
.
The
*NL*
gaiety
had
faded
from
her
eyes
,
and
she
said
with
great
gentleness
:
*NL*
``
Surely
,
Granny
,
we
can
persuade
them
between
us
to
do
as
he
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
rose
to
go
,
and
as
his
hand
met
Madame
Olenska
's
he
felt
that
*NL*
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
make
some
allusion
to
her
unanswered
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
can
I
see
you
?
''
he
asked
,
as
she
walked
with
him
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
like
;
but
it
must
be
soon
if
you
want
to
see
the
little
*NL*
house
again
.
I
am
moving
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pang
shot
through
him
at
the
memory
of
his
lamplit
hours
in
the
*NL*
low-studded
drawing-room
.
Few
as
they
had
been
,
they
were
thick
with
*NL*
memories
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
``
Tomorrow
;
yes
;
but
early
.
I
'm
going
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
a
Sunday
,
and
if
she
were
``
going
out
''
on
a
Sunday
*NL*
evening
it
could
,
of
course
,
be
only
to
Mrs.
Lemuel
Struthers
's
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
slight
movement
of
annoyance
,
not
so
much
at
her
going
there
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
rather
liked
her
going
where
she
pleased
in
spite
of
the
van
*NL*
der
Luydens
-RRB-
,
but
because
it
was
the
kind
of
house
at
which
she
was
*NL*
sure
to
meet
Beaufort
,
where
she
must
have
known
beforehand
that
she
*NL*
would
meet
him
--
and
where
she
was
probably
going
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
tomorrow
evening
,
''
he
repeated
,
inwardly
resolved
that
he
*NL*
would
not
go
early
,
and
that
by
reaching
her
door
late
he
would
either
*NL*
prevent
her
from
going
to
Mrs.
Struthers
's
,
or
else
arrive
after
she
*NL*
had
started
--
which
,
all
things
considered
,
would
no
doubt
be
the
*NL*
simplest
solution
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
half-past
eight
,
after
all
,
when
he
rang
the
bell
under
the
*NL*
wisteria
;
not
as
late
as
he
had
intended
by
half
an
hour
--
but
a
*NL*
singular
restlessness
had
driven
him
to
her
door
.
He
reflected
,
*NL*
however
,
that
Mrs.
Struthers
's
Sunday
evenings
were
not
like
a
ball
,
*NL*
and
that
her
guests
,
as
if
to
minimise
their
delinquency
,
usually
went
*NL*
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
thing
he
had
not
counted
on
,
in
entering
Madame
Olenska
's
hall
,
*NL*
was
to
find
hats
and
overcoats
there
.
Why
had
she
bidden
him
to
come
*NL*
early
if
she
was
having
people
to
dine
?
On
a
closer
inspection
of
the
*NL*
garments
besides
which
Nastasia
was
laying
his
own
,
his
resentment
gave
*NL*
way
to
curiosity
.
The
overcoats
were
in
fact
the
very
strangest
he
had
*NL*
ever
seen
under
a
polite
roof
;
and
it
took
but
a
glance
to
assure
*NL*
himself
that
neither
of
them
belonged
to
Julius
Beaufort
.
One
was
a
*NL*
shaggy
yellow
ulster
of
``
reach-me-down
''
cut
,
the
other
a
very
old
and
*NL*
rusty
cloak
with
a
cape
--
something
like
what
the
French
called
a
*NL*
``
Macfarlane
.
''
This
garment
,
which
appeared
to
be
made
for
a
person
of
*NL*
prodigious
size
,
had
evidently
seen
long
and
hard
wear
,
and
its
*NL*
greenish-black
folds
gave
out
a
moist
sawdusty
smell
suggestive
of
*NL*
prolonged
sessions
against
bar-room
walls
.
On
it
lay
a
ragged
grey
*NL*
scarf
and
an
odd
felt
hat
of
semiclerical
shape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
raised
his
eyebrows
enquiringly
at
Nastasia
,
who
raised
hers
in
*NL*
return
with
a
fatalistic
``
Gia
!
''
as
she
threw
open
the
drawing-room
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
saw
at
once
that
his
hostess
was
not
in
the
room
;
then
,
*NL*
with
surprise
,
he
discovered
another
lady
standing
by
the
fire
.
This
*NL*
lady
,
who
was
long
,
lean
and
loosely
put
together
,
was
clad
in
raiment
*NL*
intricately
looped
and
fringed
,
with
plaids
and
stripes
and
bands
of
*NL*
plain
colour
disposed
in
a
design
to
which
the
clue
seemed
missing
.
*NL*
Her
hair
,
which
had
tried
to
turn
white
and
only
succeeded
in
fading
,
*NL*
was
surmounted
by
a
Spanish
comb
and
black
lace
scarf
,
and
silk
*NL*
mittens
,
visibly
darned
,
covered
her
rheumatic
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
her
,
in
a
cloud
of
cigar-smoke
,
stood
the
owners
of
the
two
*NL*
overcoats
,
both
in
morning
clothes
that
they
had
evidently
not
taken
*NL*
off
since
morning
.
In
one
of
the
two
,
Archer
,
to
his
surprise
,
*NL*
recognised
Ned
Winsett
;
the
other
and
older
,
who
was
unknown
to
him
,
*NL*
and
whose
gigantic
frame
declared
him
to
be
the
wearer
of
the
*NL*
``
Macfarlane
,
''
had
a
feebly
leonine
head
with
crumpled
grey
hair
,
and
*NL*
moved
his
arms
with
large
pawing
gestures
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
distributing
lay
blessings
to
a
kneeling
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
three
persons
stood
together
on
the
hearth-rug
,
their
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
an
extraordinarily
large
bouquet
of
crimson
roses
,
with
a
knot
of
*NL*
purple
pansies
at
their
base
,
that
lay
on
the
sofa
where
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
usually
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
they
must
have
cost
at
this
season
--
though
of
course
it
's
the
*NL*
sentiment
one
cares
about
!
''
the
lady
was
saying
in
a
sighing
staccato
*NL*
as
Archer
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
turned
with
surprise
at
his
appearance
,
and
the
lady
,
*NL*
advancing
,
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Mr.
Archer
--
almost
my
cousin
Newland
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
am
the
*NL*
Marchioness
Manson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
bowed
,
and
she
continued
:
``
My
Ellen

taken
me
in
for
a
few
*NL*
days

I
came
from
Cuba

where
I
have
been
spending
the
winter
with
*NL*
Spanish
friends
--
such
delightful
distinguished
people
:
the
highest
*NL*
nobility
of
old
Castile
--
how
I
wish
you
could
know
them
!
But
I
was
*NL*
called
away
by
our
dear
great
friend
here
,
Dr.
Carver
.
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
Dr.
Agathon
Carver
,
founder
of
the
Valley
of
Love
Community

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Carver
inclined
his
leonine
head
,
and
the
Marchioness
continued
:
*NL*
``
Ah

New
York

New

*NL*

reached

not
by
that
route

Winsett
*NL*
said
with
his
dry
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marchioness
shook
her
head
reprovingly
.
``

do
you
know

``

interjected
Dr.
Carver
in
a
stentorian
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
sit
down

Mr.
Archer

We
four
have
been
having
a
delightful

little

my
child
has
gone
up
to
dress

expects

you

she
will
be
down
in
a
moment

We
were
just
admiring
these

marvellous
flowers

which
will
surprise
her
when
she
reappears

*NL*
*NL*
Winsett
remained
on
his
feet
.
``
I

afraid
I
must
be
off

Please
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

``

said
Winsett
,
including
the
group
*NL*
in
a
general
nod
and
slipping
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

spirit
;
and
*NL*
tonight
he
is
mentally
preparing
the
lecture
he
is
to
deliver
presently
*NL*
at
Mrs.
Blenker
's
.
Dr.
Carver
,
would
there
be
time
,
before
you
start
*NL*
for
the
Blenkers
'
to
explain
to
Mr.
Archer
your
illuminating
discovery
*NL*
of
the
Direct
Contact
?
But
no
;
I
see
it
is
nearly
nine
o'clock
,
and
we
*NL*
have
no
right
to
detain
you
while
so
many
are
waiting
for
your
message
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Carver
looked
slightly
disappointed
at
this
conclusion
,
but
,
having
*NL*
compared
his
ponderous
gold
time-piece
with
Madame
Olenska
's
little
*NL*
travelling-clock
,
he
reluctantly
gathered
up
his
mighty
limbs
for
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
you
later
,
dear
friend
?
''
he
suggested
to
the
Marchioness
,
*NL*
who
replied
with
a
smile
:
``
As
soon
as
Ellen
's
carriage
comes
I
will
*NL*
join
you
;
I
do
hope
the
lecture
wo
n't
have
begun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Carver
looked
thoughtfully
at
Archer
.
``
Perhaps
,
if
this
young
*NL*
gentleman
is
interested
in
my
experiences
,
Mrs.
Blenker
might
allow
you
*NL*
to
bring
him
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
friend
,
if
it
were
possible
--
I
am
sure
she
would
be
too
*NL*
happy
.
But
I
fear
my
Ellen
counts
on
Mr.
Archer
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
Dr.
Carver
,
``
is
unfortunate
--
but
here
is
my
card
.
''
He
*NL*
handed
it
to
Archer
,
who
read
on
it
,
in
Gothic
characters
:

*NL*
Dr.
Carver
bowed
himself
out
,
and
Mrs.
Manson
,
with
a
sigh
that
might
*NL*
have
been
either
of
regret
or
relief
,
again
waved
Archer
to
a
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
will
be
down
in
a
moment
;
and
before
she
comes
,
I
am
so
glad
of
*NL*
this
quiet
moment
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
murmured
his
pleasure
at
their
meeting
,
and
the
Marchioness
*NL*
continued
,
in
her
low
sighing
accents
:
``
I
know
everything
,
dear
Mr.
*NL*
Archer
--
my
child
has
told
me
all
you
have
done
for
her
.
Your
wise
*NL*
advice
:
your
courageous
firmness
--
thank
heaven
it
was
not
too
late
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
listened
with
considerable
embarrassment
.
Was
there
any
*NL*
one
,
he
wondered
,
to
whom
Madame
Olenska
had
not
proclaimed
his
*NL*
intervention
in
her
private
affairs
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Olenska
exaggerates
;
I
simply
gave
her
a
legal
opinion
,
as
she
*NL*
asked
me
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
in
doing
it
--
in
doing
it
you
were
the
unconscious
instrument
*NL*
of
--
of
--
what
word
have
we
moderns
for
Providence
,
Mr.
Archer
?
''
cried
*NL*
the
lady
,
tilting
her
head
on
one
side
and
drooping
her
lids
*NL*
mysteriously
.
``
Little
did
you
know
that
at
that
very
moment
I
was
*NL*
being
appealed
to
:
being
approached
,
in
fact
--
from
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
Atlantic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
over
her
shoulder
,
as
though
fearful
of
being
overheard
,
*NL*
and
then
,
drawing
her
chair
nearer
,
and
raising
a
tiny
ivory
fan
to
her
*NL*
lips
,
breathed
behind
it
:
``
By
the
Count
himself
--
my
poor
,
mad
,
foolish
*NL*
Olenski
;
who
asks
only
to
take
her
back
on
her
own
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
Archer
exclaimed
,
springing
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
horrified
?
Yes
,
of
course
;
I
understand
.
I
do
n't
defend
poor
*NL*
Stanislas
,
though
he
has
always
called
me
his
best
friend
.
He
does
not
*NL*
defend
himself
--
he
casts
himself
at
her
feet
:
in
my
person
.
''
She
*NL*
tapped
her
emaciated
bosom
.
``
I
have
his
letter
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
letter
?
--
Has
Madame
Olenska
seen
it
?
''
Archer
stammered
,
his
brain
*NL*
whirling
with
the
shock
of
the
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marchioness
Manson
shook
her
head
softly
.
``
Time
--
time
;
I
must
have
*NL*
time
.
I
know
my
Ellen
--
haughty
,
intractable
;
shall
I
say
,
just
a
shade
*NL*
unforgiving
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
good
heavens
,
to
forgive
is
one
thing
;
to
go
back
into
that
*NL*
hell
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
the
Marchioness
acquiesced
.
``
So
she
describes
it
--
my
*NL*
sensitive
child
!
But
on
the
material
side
,
Mr.
Archer
,
if
one
may
*NL*
stoop
to
consider
such
things
;
do
you
know
what
she
is
giving
up
?
*NL*
Those
roses
there
on
the
sofa
--
acres
like
them
,
under
glass
and
in
the
*NL*
open
,
in
his
matchless
terraced
gardens
at
Nice
!
Jewels
--
historic
*NL*
pearls
:
the
Sobieski
emeralds
--
sables
,
--
but
she
cares
nothing
for
all
*NL*
these
!
Art
and
beauty
,
those
she
does
care
for
,
she
lives
for
,
as
I
*NL*
always
have
;
and
those
also
surrounded
her
.
Pictures
,
priceless
*NL*
furniture
,
music
,
brilliant
conversation
--
ah
,
that
,
my
dear
young
man
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
excuse
me
,
is
what
you
've
no
conception
of
here
!
And
she
had
*NL*
it
all
;
and
the
homage
of
the
greatest
.
She
tells
me
she
is
not
*NL*
thought
handsome
in
New
York
--
good
heavens
!
Her
portrait
has
been
*NL*
painted
nine
times
;
the
greatest
artists
in
Europe
have
begged
for
the
*NL*
privilege
.
Are
these
things
nothing
?
And
the
remorse
of
an
adoring
*NL*
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Marchioness
Manson
rose
to
her
climax
her
face
assumed
an
*NL*
expression
of
ecstatic
retrospection
which
would
have
moved
Archer
's
*NL*
mirth
had
he
not
been
numb
with
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
laughed
if
any
one
had
foretold
to
him
that
his
first
*NL*
sight
of
poor
Medora
Manson
would
have
been
in
the
guise
of
a
messenger
*NL*
of
Satan
;
but
he
was
in
no
mood
for
laughing
now
,
and
she
seemed
to
him
*NL*
to
come
straight
out
of
the
hell
from
which
Ellen
Olenska
had
just
*NL*
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knows
nothing
yet
--
of
all
this
?
''
he
asked
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Manson
laid
a
purple
finger
on
her
lips
.
``
Nothing
directly
--
but
*NL*
does
she
suspect
?
Who
can
tell
?
The
truth
is
,
Mr.
Archer
,
I
have
been
*NL*
waiting
to
see
you
.
From
the
moment
I
heard
of
the
firm
stand
you
had
*NL*
taken
,
and
of
your
influence
over
her
,
I
hoped
it
might
be
possible
to
*NL*
count
on
your
support
--
to
convince
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
ought
to
go
back
?
I
would
rather
see
her
dead
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
young
man
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
the
Marchioness
murmured
,
without
visible
resentment
.
For
a
*NL*
while
she
sat
in
her
arm-chair
,
opening
and
shutting
the
absurd
ivory
*NL*
fan
between
her
mittened
fingers
;
but
suddenly
she
lifted
her
head
and
*NL*
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
she
comes
,
''
she
said
in
a
rapid
whisper
;
and
then
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
bouquet
on
the
sofa
:
``
Am
I
to
understand
that
you
prefer
THAT
,
Mr.
*NL*
Archer
?
After
all
,
marriage
is
marriage
...
and
my
niece
is
still
a
*NL*
wife
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
two
plotting
together
,
aunt
Medora
?
''
Madame
Olenska
cried
*NL*
as
she
came
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dressed
as
if
for
a
ball
.
Everything
about
her
shimmered
and
*NL*
glimmered
softly
,
as
if
her
dress
had
been
woven
out
of
candle-beams
;
*NL*
and
she
carried
her
head
high
,
like
a
pretty
woman
challenging
a
*NL*
roomful
of
rivals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
saying
,
my
dear
,
that
here
was
something
beautiful
to
surprise
*NL*
you
with
,
''
Mrs.
Manson
rejoined
,
rising
to
her
feet
and
pointing
archly
*NL*
to
the
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
stopped
short
and
looked
at
the
bouquet
.
Her
colour
did
*NL*
not
change
,
but
a
sort
of
white
radiance
of
anger
ran
over
her
like
*NL*
summer
lightning
.
``
Ah
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
shrill
voice
that
the
*NL*
young
man
had
never
heard
,
``
who
is
ridiculous
enough
to
send
me
a
*NL*
bouquet
?
Why
a
bouquet
?
And
why
tonight
of
all
nights
?
I
am
not
*NL*
going
to
a
ball
;
I
am
not
a
girl
engaged
to
be
married
.
But
some
*NL*
people
are
always
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
back
to
the
door
,
opened
it
,
and
called
out
:
``
Nastasia
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ubiquitous
handmaiden
promptly
appeared
,
and
Archer
heard
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
say
,
in
an
Italian
that
she
seemed
to
pronounce
with
*NL*
intentional
deliberateness
in
order
that
he
might
follow
it
:
*NL*
``
Here
--
throw
this
into
the
dustbin
!
''
and
then
,
as
Nastasia
stared
*NL*
protestingly
:
``
But
no
--
it
's
not
the
fault
of
the
poor
flowers
.
Tell
*NL*
the
boy
to
carry
them
to
the
house
three
doors
away
,
the
house
of
Mr.
*NL*
Winsett
,
the
dark
gentleman
who
dined
here
.
His
wife
is
ill
--
they
may
*NL*
give
her
pleasure
...
The
boy
is
out
,
you
say
?
Then
,
my
dear
one
,
run
*NL*
yourself
;
here
,
put
my
cloak
over
you
and
fly
.
I
want
the
thing
out
of
*NL*
the
house
immediately
!
And
,
as
you
live
,
do
n't
say
they
come
from
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
her
velvet
opera
cloak
over
the
maid
's
shoulders
and
turned
*NL*
back
into
the
drawing-room
,
shutting
the
door
sharply
.
Her
bosom
was
*NL*
rising
high
under
its
lace
,
and
for
a
moment
Archer
thought
she
was
*NL*
about
to
cry
;
but
she
burst
into
a
laugh
instead
,
and
looking
from
the
*NL*
Marchioness
to
Archer
,
asked
abruptly
:
``
And
you
two
--
have
you
made
*NL*
friends
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
for
Mr.
Archer
to
say

darling

he
has
waited
patiently
while
you
*NL*
were
dressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
gave
you
time
enough
:
my
hair
would
n't
go

''
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
said
,
raising
her
hand
to
the
heaped-up
curls
of
her
chignon
.
``
But
*NL*
that
reminds
me
:
I
see
Dr.
Carver
is
gone
,
and
you
'll
be
late
at
the
*NL*
Blenkers
'
.
Mr.
Archer
,
will
you
put
my
aunt
in
the
carriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
the
Marchioness
into
the
hall
,
saw
her
fitted
into
a
*NL*
miscellaneous
heap
of
overshoes
,
shawls
and
tippets
,
and
called
from
*NL*
the
doorstep
:
``
Mind
,
the
carriage
is
to
be
back
for
me
at
ten
!
''
Then
*NL*
she
returned
to
the
drawing-room
,
where
Archer
,
on
re-entering
it
,
*NL*
found
her
standing
by
the
mantelpiece
,
examining
herself
in
the
mirror
.
*NL*
It
was
not
usual
,
in
New
York
society
,
for
a
lady
to
address
her
*NL*
parlour-maid
as
``
my
dear
one
,
''
and
send
her
out
on
an
errand
wrapped
in
*NL*
her
own
opera-cloak
;
and
Archer
,
through
all
his
deeper
feelings
,
*NL*
tasted
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
being
in
a
world
where
action
*NL*
followed
on
emotion
with
such
Olympian
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
did
not
move
when
he
came
up
behind
her
,
and
for
a
*NL*
second
their
eyes
met
in
the
mirror
;
then
she
turned
,
threw
herself
*NL*
into
her
sofa-corner
,
and
sighed
out
:
``
There
's
time
for
a
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
her
the
box
and
lit
a
spill
for
her
;
and
as
the
flame
flashed
*NL*
up
into
her
face
she
glanced
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
and
said
:
``
What
*NL*
do
you
think
of
me
in
a
temper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
paused
a
moment
;
then
he
answered
with
sudden
resolution
:
``
It
*NL*
makes
me
understand
what
your
aunt
has
been
saying
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
she
'd
been
talking
about
me
.
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
you
were
used
to
all
kinds
of
things
--
splendours
and
*NL*
amusements
and
excitements
--
that
we
could
never
hope
to
give
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
smiled
faintly
into
the
circle
of
smoke
about
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Medora
is
incorrigibly
romantic
.
It
has
made
up
to
her
for
so
many
*NL*
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
hesitated
again
,
and
again
took
his
risk
.
``
Is
your
aunt
's
*NL*
romanticism
always
consistent
with
accuracy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
:
does
she
speak
the
truth
?
''
Her
niece
considered
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
:
in
almost
everything
she
says
,
there
's
something
true
*NL*
and
something
untrue
.
But
why
do
you
ask
?
What
has
she
been
telling
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
into
the
fire
,
and
then
back
at
her
shining
presence
.
*NL*
His
heart
tightened
with
the
thought
that
this
was
their
last
evening
*NL*
by
that
fireside
,
and
that
in
a
moment
the
carriage
would
come
to
carry
*NL*
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
--
she
pretends
that
Count
Olenski
has
asked
her
to
persuade
*NL*
you
to
go
back
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
made
no
answer
.
She
sat
motionless
,
holding
her
*NL*
cigarette
in
her
half-lifted
hand
.
The
expression
of
her
face
had
not
*NL*
changed
;
and
Archer
remembered
that
he
had
before
noticed
her
apparent
*NL*
incapacity
for
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
,
then
?
''
he
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
so
long
that
the
ash
dropped
from
her
cigarette
.
*NL*
She
brushed
it
to
the
floor
.
``
She
has
hinted
about
a
letter
:
poor
*NL*
darling
!
Medora
's
hints
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
at
your
husband
's
request
that
she
has
arrived
here
suddenly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
seemed
to
consider
this
question
also
.
``
There
again
:
*NL*
one
ca
n't
tell
.
She
told
me
she
had
had
a
`
spiritual
summons
,
'
*NL*
whatever
that
is
,
from
Dr.
Carver
.
I
'm
afraid
she
's
going
to
marry
Dr.
*NL*
Carver
...
poor
Medora
,
there
's
always
some
one
she
wants
to
marry
.
*NL*
But
perhaps
the
people
in
Cuba
just
got
tired
of
her
!
I
think
she
was
*NL*
with
them
as
a
sort
of
paid
companion
.
Really
,
I
do
n't
know
why
she
*NL*
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
believe
she
has
a
letter
from
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Madame
Olenska
brooded
silently
;
then
she
said
:
``
After
all
,
it
*NL*
was
to
be
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
rose
and
went
to
lean
against
the
fireplace
.
A
sudden
*NL*
restlessness
possessed
him
,
and
he
was
tongue-tied
by
the
sense
that
*NL*
their
minutes
were
numbered
,
and
that
at
any
moment
he
might
hear
the
*NL*
wheels
of
the
returning
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
your
aunt
believes
you
will
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
raised
her
head
quickly
.
A
deep
blush
rose
to
her
face
*NL*
and
spread
over
her
neck
and
shoulders
.
She
blushed
seldom
and
*NL*
painfully
,
as
if
it
hurt
her
like
a
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
cruel
things
have
been
believed
of
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Ellen
--
forgive
me
;
I
'm
a
fool
and
a
brute
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
a
little
.
``
You
are
horribly
nervous
;
you
have
your
own
*NL*
troubles
.
I
know
you
think
the
Wellands
are
unreasonable
about
your
*NL*
marriage
,
and
of
course
I
agree
with
you
.
In
Europe
people
do
n't
*NL*
understand
our
long
American
engagements
;
I
suppose
they
are
not
as
*NL*
calm
as
we
are
.
''
She
pronounced
the
``
we
''
with
a
faint
emphasis
that
*NL*
gave
it
an
ironic
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
the
irony
but
did
not
dare
to
take
it
up
.
After
all
,
she
*NL*
had
perhaps
purposely
deflected
the
conversation
from
her
own
affairs
,
*NL*
and
after
the
pain
his
last
words
had
evidently
caused
her
he
felt
that
*NL*
all
he
could
do
was
to
follow
her
lead
.
But
the
sense
of
the
waning
*NL*
hour
made
him
desperate
:
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
a
barrier
*NL*
of
words
should
drop
between
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
abruptly
;
``
I
went
south
to
ask
May
to
marry
me
after
*NL*
Easter
.
There
's
no
reason
why
we
should
n't
be
married
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
May
adores
you
--
and
yet
you
could
n't
convince
her
?
I
thought
her
*NL*
too
intelligent
to
be
the
slave
of
such
absurd
superstitions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
IS
too
intelligent
--
she
's
not
their
slave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
looked
at
him
.
``
Well
,
then
--
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
reddened
,
and
hurried
on
with
a
rush
.
``
We
had
a
frank
*NL*
talk
--
almost
the
first
.
She
thinks
my
impatience
a
bad
sign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful
heavens
--
a
bad
sign
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thinks
it
means
that
I
ca
n't
trust
myself
to
go
on
caring
for
her
.
*NL*
She
thinks
,
in
short
,
I
want
to
marry
her
at
once
to
get
away
from
some
*NL*
one
that
I
--
care
for
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
examined
this
curiously
.
``
But
if
she
thinks
that
--
why
*NL*
is
n't
she
in
a
hurry
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
's
not
like
that
:
she
's
so
much
nobler
.
She
insists
all
*NL*
the
more
on
the
long
engagement
,
to
give
me
time
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
to
give
her
up
for
the
other
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
leaned
toward
the
fire
and
gazed
into
it
with
fixed
*NL*
eyes
.
Down
the
quiet
street
Archer
heard
the
approaching
trot
of
her
*NL*
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
IS
noble
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
slight
break
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
it
's
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ridiculous
?
Because
you
do
n't
care
for
any
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
mean
to
marry
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
.
''
There
was
another
long
interval
.
At
length
she
looked
up
at
him
*NL*
and
asked
:
``
This
other
woman
--
does
she
love
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
's
no
other
woman
;
I
mean
,
the
person
that
May
was
thinking
*NL*
of
is
--
was
never
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
why
,
after
all
,
are
you
in
such
haste
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
your
carriage
,
''
said
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
half-rose
and
looked
about
her
with
absent
eyes
.
Her
fan
and
*NL*
gloves
lay
on
the
sofa
beside
her
and
she
picked
them
up
mechanically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
suppose
I
must
be
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
going
to
Mrs.
Struthers
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
She
smiled
and
added
:
``
I
must
go
where
I
am
invited
,
or
I
*NL*
should
be
too
lonely
.
Why
not
come
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
that
at
any
cost
he
must
keep
her
beside
him
,
must
make
her
*NL*
give
him
the
rest
of
her
evening
.
Ignoring
her
question
,
he
continued
*NL*
to
lean
against
the
chimney-piece
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hand
in
which
*NL*
she
held
her
gloves
and
fan
,
as
if
watching
to
see
if
he
had
the
power
*NL*
to
make
her
drop
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
guessed
the
truth
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
is
another
woman
--
but
not
the
*NL*
one
she
thinks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ellen
Olenska
made
no
answer
,
and
did
not
move
.
After
a
moment
he
sat
*NL*
down
beside
her
,
and
,
taking
her
hand
,
softly
unclasped
it
,
so
that
the
*NL*
gloves
and
fan
fell
on
the
sofa
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
up
,
and
freeing
herself
from
him
moved
away
to
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
hearth
.
``
Ah
,
do
n't
make
love
to
me
!
Too
many
people
have
*NL*
done
that
,
''
she
said
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
changing
colour
,
stood
up
also
:
it
was
the
bitterest
rebuke
she
*NL*
could
have
given
him
.
``
I
have
never
made
love
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
*NL*
never
shall
.
But
you
are
the
woman
I
would
have
married
if
it
had
been
*NL*
possible
for
either
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possible
for
either
of
us
?
''
She
looked
at
him
with
unfeigned
*NL*
astonishment
.
``
And
you
say
that
--
when
it
's
you
who
've
made
it
*NL*
impossible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
at
her
,
groping
in
a
blackness
through
which
a
single
arrow
*NL*
of
light
tore
its
blinding
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'VE
made
it
impossible
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
you
,
YOU
!
''
she
cried
,
her
lip
trembling
like
a
child
's
on
the
*NL*
verge
of
tears
.
``
Is
n't
it
you
who
made
me
give
up
divorcing
--
give
it
*NL*
up
because
you
showed
me
how
selfish
and
wicked
it
was
,
how
one
must
*NL*
sacrifice
one
's
self
to
preserve
the
dignity
of
marriage
...
and
to
*NL*
spare
one
's
family
the
publicity
,
the
scandal
?
And
because
my
family
*NL*
was
going
to
be
your
family
--
for
May
's
sake
and
for
yours
--
I
did
what
*NL*
you
told
me
,
what
you
proved
to
me
that
I
ought
to
do
.
Ah
,
''
she
broke
*NL*
out
with
a
sudden
laugh
,
``
I
've
made
no
secret
of
having
done
it
for
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
down
on
the
sofa
again
,
crouching
among
the
festive
ripples
of
*NL*
her
dress
like
a
stricken
masquerader
;
and
the
young
man
stood
by
the
*NL*
fireplace
and
continued
to
gaze
at
her
without
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
''
he
groaned
.
``
When
I
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
ask
me
what
I
thought
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
looking
at
her
,
he
saw
the
same
burning
flush
creep
up
her
neck
*NL*
to
her
face
.
She
sat
upright
,
facing
him
with
a
rigid
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
:
there
were
things
in
that
letter
you
asked
me
to
read
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
's
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
nothing
to
fear
from
that
letter
:
absolutely
nothing
!
All
I
*NL*
feared
was
to
bring
notoriety
,
scandal
,
on
the
family
--
on
you
and
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
''
he
groaned
again
,
bowing
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
that
followed
lay
on
them
with
the
weight
of
things
final
*NL*
and
irrevocable
.
It
seemed
to
Archer
to
be
crushing
him
down
like
his
*NL*
own
grave-stone
;
in
all
the
wide
future
he
saw
nothing
that
would
ever
*NL*
lift
that
load
from
his
heart
.
He
did
not
move
from
his
place
,
or
*NL*
raise
his
head
from
his
hands
;
his
hidden
eyeballs
went
on
staring
into
*NL*
utter
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
I
loved
you
--
''
he
brought
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
,
from
the
sofa-corner
where
he
supposed
*NL*
that
she
still
crouched
,
he
heard
a
faint
stifled
crying
like
a
*NL*
child
's
.
He
started
up
and
came
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
!
What
madness
!
Why
are
you
crying
?
Nothing
's
done
that
ca
n't
*NL*
be
undone
.
I
'm
still
free
,
and
you
're
going
to
be
.
''
He
had
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
her
face
like
a
wet
flower
at
his
lips
,
and
all
their
vain
*NL*
terrors
shrivelling
up
like
ghosts
at
sunrise
.
The
one
thing
that
*NL*
astonished
him
now
was
that
he
should
have
stood
for
five
minutes
*NL*
arguing
with
her
across
the
width
of
the
room
,
when
just
touching
her
*NL*
made
everything
so
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
back
all
his
kiss
,
but
after
a
moment
he
felt
her
*NL*
stiffening
in
his
arms
,
and
she
put
him
aside
and
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
poor
Newland
--
I
suppose
this
had
to
be
.
But
it
does
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
alter
things
,
''
she
said
,
looking
down
at
him
in
her
turn
from
the
*NL*
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
alters
the
whole
of
life
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
--
it
must
n't
,
it
ca
n't
.
You
're
engaged
to
May
Welland
;
and
I
'm
*NL*
married

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
too
,
flushed
and
resolute
.
``
Nonsense
!
It
's
too
late
for
*NL*
that
sort
of
thing
.
We
've
no
right
to
lie
to
other
people
or
to
*NL*
ourselves
.
We
wo
n't
talk
of
your
marriage
;
but
do
you
see
me
marrying
*NL*
May
after
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
silent
,
resting
her
thin
elbows
on
the
mantelpiece
,
her
*NL*
profile
reflected
in
the
glass
behind
her
.
One
of
the
locks
of
her
*NL*
chignon
had
become
loosened
and
hung
on
her
neck
;
she
looked
haggard
*NL*
and
almost
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
you
,
''
she
said
at
length
,
``
putting
that
question
to
May
.
*NL*
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
reckless
shrug
.
``
It
's
too
late
to
do
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
because
it
's
the
easiest
thing
to
say
at
this
moment

not
*NL*
because
it
's
true
.
In
reality
it
's
too
late
to
do
anything
but
what
*NL*
we
'd
both
decided
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
forced
a
pitiful
smile
that
pinched
her
face
instead
of
smoothing
*NL*
it
.
``
You
do
n't
understand
because
you
have
n't
yet
guessed
how
you
've
*NL*
changed
things
for
me

oh
,
from
the
first
--
long
before
I
knew
all
you
'd
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
'd
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
was
perfectly
unconscious
at
first
that
people
here
were
shy
*NL*
of
me
--
that
they
thought
I
was
a
dreadful
sort
of
person
.
It
seems
*NL*
they
had
even
refused
to
meet
me
at
dinner
.
I
found
that
out
*NL*
afterward
;
and
how
you
'd
made
your
mother
go
with
you
to
the
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
'
;
and
how
you
'd
insisted
on
announcing
your
engagement
at
the
*NL*
Beaufort
ball
,
so
that
I
might
have
two
families
to
stand
by
me
instead
*NL*
of
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
he
broke
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
imagine
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
stupid
and
unobservant
I
was
!
I
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
all
this
till
Granny
blurted
it
out
one
day
.
New
York
*NL*
simply
meant
peace
and
freedom
to
me
:
it
was
coming
home
.
And
I
was
so
*NL*
happy
at
being
among
my
own
people
that
every
one
I
met
seemed
kind
and
*NL*
good
,
and
glad
to
see
me
.
But
from
the
very
beginning
,
''
she
continued
,
*NL*
``
I
felt
there
was
no
one
as
kind
as
you
;
no
one
who
gave
me
reasons
*NL*
that
I
understood
for
doing
what
at
first
seemed
so
hard
*NL*
and
--
unnecessary
.
The
very
good
people
did
n't
convince
me
;
I
felt
*NL*
they
'd
never
been
tempted
.
But
you
knew
;
you
understood
;
you
had
felt
*NL*
the
world
outside
tugging
at
one
with
all
its
golden
hands
--
and
yet
you
*NL*
hated
the
things
it
asks
of
one
;
you
hated
happiness
bought
by
*NL*
disloyalty
and
cruelty
and
indifference
.
That
was
what
I
'd
never
known
*NL*
before
--
and
it
's
better
than
anything
I
've
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
in
a
low
even
voice
,
without
tears
or
visible
agitation
;
and
*NL*
each
word
,
as
it
dropped
from
her
,
fell
into
his
breast
like
burning
*NL*
lead
.
He
sat
bowed
over
,
his
head
between
his
hands
,
staring
at
the
*NL*
hearthrug
,
and
at
the
tip
of
the
satin
shoe
that
showed
under
her
*NL*
dress
.
Suddenly
he
knelt
down
and
kissed
the
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
over
him
,
laying
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
eyes
so
deep
that
he
remained
motionless
under
her
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
let
us
undo
what
you
've
done
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
ca
n't
go
back
*NL*
now
to
that
other
way
of
thinking
.
I
ca
n't
love
you
unless
I
give
you
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
arms
were
yearning
up
to
her
;
but
she
drew
away
,
and
they
remained
*NL*
facing
each
other
,
divided
by
the
distance
that
her
words
had
created
.
*NL*
Then
,
abruptly
,
his
anger
overflowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Beaufort
?
Is
he
to
replace
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
words
sprang
out
he
was
prepared
for
an
answering
flare
of
*NL*
anger
;
and
he
would
have
welcomed
it
as
fuel
for
his
own
.
But
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
only
grew
a
shade
paler
,
and
stood
with
her
arms
hanging
down
*NL*
before
her
,
and
her
head
slightly
bent
,
as
her
way
was
when
she
*NL*
pondered
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
waiting
for
you
now
at
Mrs.
Struthers
's
;
why
do
n't
you
go
to
*NL*
him
?
''
Archer
sneered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
ring
the
bell
.
``
I
shall
not
go
out
this
evening
;
tell
*NL*
the
carriage
to
go
and
fetch
the
Signora
Marchesa
,
''
she
said
when
the
*NL*
maid
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
door
had
closed
again
Archer
continued
to
look
at
her
with
*NL*
bitter
eyes
.
``
Why
this
sacrifice
?
Since
you
tell
me
that
you
're
*NL*
lonely
I
've
no
right
to
keep
you
from
your
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
a
little
under
her
wet
lashes
.
``
I
sha
n't
be
lonely
now
.
I
*NL*
WAS
lonely
;
I
WAS
afraid
.
But
the
emptiness
and
the
darkness
are
gone
;
*NL*
when
I
turn
back
into
myself
now
I
'm
like
a
child
going
at
night
into
a
*NL*
room
where
there
's
always
a
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
and
her
look
still
enveloped
her
in
a
soft
inaccessibility
,
*NL*
and
Archer
groaned
out
again
:
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
understand
May
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reddened
under
the
retort
,
but
kept
his
eyes
on
her
.
``
May
is
ready
*NL*
to
give
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Three
days
after
you
've
entreated
her
on
your
knees
to
hasten
*NL*
your
marriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
refused
;
that
gives
me
the
right
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
've
taught
me
what
an
ugly
word
that
is
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
with
a
sense
of
utter
weariness
.
He
felt
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
struggling
for
hours
up
the
face
of
a
steep
precipice
,
and
*NL*
now
,
just
as
he
had
fought
his
way
to
the
top
,
his
hold
had
given
way
*NL*
and
he
was
pitching
down
headlong
into
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
could
have
got
her
in
his
arms
again
he
might
have
swept
away
her
*NL*
arguments
;
but
she
still
held
him
at
a
distance
by
something
*NL*
inscrutably
aloof
in
her
look
and
attitude
,
and
by
his
own
awed
sense
*NL*
of
her
sincerity
.
At
length
he
began
to
plead
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
do
this
now
it
will
be
worse
afterward
--
worse
for
every
one
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
no
!
''
she
almost
screamed
,
as
if
he
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
bell
sent
a
long
tinkle
through
the
house
.
They
had
*NL*
heard
no
carriage
stopping
at
the
door
,
and
they
stood
motionless
,
*NL*
looking
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
,
Nastasia
's
step
crossed
the
hall
,
the
outer
door
opened
,
and
a
*NL*
moment
later
she
came
in
carrying
a
telegram
which
she
handed
to
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
was
very
happy
at
the
flowers
,
''
Nastasia
said
,
smoothing
her
*NL*
apron
.
``
She
thought
it
was
her
signor
marito
who
had
sent
them
,
and
*NL*
she
cried
a
little
and
said
it
was
a
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mistress
smiled
and
took
the
yellow
envelope
.
She
tore
it
open
and
*NL*
carried
it
to
the
lamp
;
then
,
when
the
door
had
closed
again
,
she
*NL*
handed
the
telegram
to
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dated
from
St.
Augustine
,
and
addressed
to
the
Countess
Olenska
.
*NL*
In
it
he
read
:
``
Granny
's
telegram
successful
.
Papa
and
Mamma
agree
*NL*
marriage
after
Easter
.
Am
telegraphing
Newland
.
Am
too
happy
for
*NL*
words
and
love
you
dearly
.
Your
grateful
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
,
when
Archer
unlocked
his
own
front-door
,
he
found
a
*NL*
similar
envelope
on
the
hall-table
on
top
of
his
pile
of
notes
and
*NL*
letters
.
The
message
inside
the
envelope
was
also
from
May
Welland
,
*NL*
and
ran
as
follows
:
``
Parents
consent
wedding
Tuesday
after
Easter
at
*NL*
twelve
Grace
Church
eight
bridesmaids
please
see
Rector
so
happy
love
*NL*
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
crumpled
up
the
yellow
sheet
as
if
the
gesture
could
annihilate
*NL*
the
news
it
contained
.
Then
he
pulled
out
a
small
pocket-diary
and
*NL*
turned
over
the
pages
with
trembling
fingers
;
but
he
did
not
find
what
*NL*
he
wanted
,
and
cramming
the
telegram
into
his
pocket
he
mounted
the
*NL*
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
was
shining
through
the
door
of
the
little
hall-room
which
*NL*
served
Janey
as
a
dressing-room
and
boudoir
,
and
her
brother
rapped
*NL*
impatiently
on
the
panel
.
The
door
opened
,
and
his
sister
stood
before
*NL*
him
in
her
immemorial
purple
flannel
dressing-gown
,
with
her
hair
``
on
*NL*
pins
.
''
Her
face
looked
pale
and
apprehensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
!
I
hope
there
's
no
bad
news
in
that
telegram
?
I
waited
on
*NL*
purpose
,
in
case
--
''
-LRB-
No
item
of
his
correspondence
was
safe
from
*NL*
Janey
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
of
her
question
.
``
Look
here
--
what
day
is
Easter
this
*NL*
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
shocked
at
such
unchristian
ignorance
.
``
Easter
?
Newland
!
*NL*
Why
,
of
course
,
the
first
week
in
April
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
week
?
''
He
turned
again
to
the
pages
of
his
diary
,
*NL*
calculating
rapidly
under
his
breath
.
``
The
first
week
,
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
He
threw
back
his
head
with
a
long
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
mercy
's
sake
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
except
that
I
'm
going
to
be
married
in
a
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Janey
fell
upon
his
neck
and
pressed
him
to
her
purple
flannel
breast
.
*NL*
``
Oh
Newland
,
how
wonderful
!
I
'm
so
glad
!
But
,
dearest
,
why
do
you
*NL*
keep
on
laughing
?
Do
hush

or
you
'll
wake

XIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
fresh
,
with
a
lively
spring
wind
full
of
dust
.
All
the
old
*NL*
ladies
in
both
families
had
got
out
their
faded
sables
and
yellowing
*NL*
ermines
,
and
the
smell
of
camphor
from
the
front
pews
almost
smothered
*NL*
the
faint
spring
scent
of
the
lilies
banking
the
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
at
a
signal
from
the
sexton
,
had
come
out
of
the
vestry
*NL*
and
placed
himself
with
his
best
man
on
the
chancel
step
of
Grace
*NL*
Church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
signal
meant
that
the
brougham
bearing
the
bride
and
her
father
was
*NL*
in
sight
;
but
there
was
sure
to
be
a
considerable
interval
of
*NL*
adjustment
and
consultation
in
the
lobby
,
where
the
bridesmaids
were
*NL*
already
hovering
like
a
cluster
of
Easter
blossoms
.
During
this
*NL*
unavoidable
lapse
of
time
the
bridegroom
,
in
proof
of
his
eagerness
,
*NL*
was
expected
to
expose
himself
alone
to
the
gaze
of
the
assembled
*NL*
company
;
and
Archer
had
gone
through
this
formality
as
resignedly
as
*NL*
through
all
the
others
which
made
of
a
nineteenth
century
New
York
*NL*
wedding
a
rite
that
seemed
to
belong
to
the
dawn
of
history
.
*NL*
Everything
was
equally
easy
--
or
equally
painful
,
as
one
chose
to
put
*NL*
it
--
in
the
path
he
was
committed
to
tread
,
and
he
had
obeyed
the
*NL*
flurried
injunctions
of
his
best
man
as
piously
as
other
bridegrooms
*NL*
had
obeyed
his
own
,
in
the
days
when
he
had
guided
them
through
the
*NL*
same
labyrinth
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
he
was
reasonably
sure
of
having
fulfilled
all
his
obligations
.
*NL*
The
bridesmaids
'
eight
bouquets
of
white
lilac
and
lilies-of-the-valley
*NL*
had
been
sent
in
due
time
,
as
well
as
the
gold
and
sapphire
*NL*
sleeve-links
of
the
eight
ushers
and
the
best
man
's
cat
's
-
eye
*NL*
scarf-pin
;
Archer
had
sat
up
half
the
night
trying
to
vary
the
wording
*NL*
of
his
thanks
for
the
last
batch
of
presents
from
men
friends
and
*NL*
ex-lady-loves
;
the
fees
for
the
Bishop
and
the
Rector
were
safely
in
*NL*
the
pocket
of
his
best
man
;
his
own
luggage
was
already
at
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
's
,
where
the
wedding-breakfast
was
to
take
place
,
and
so
were
*NL*
the
travelling
clothes
into
which
he
was
to
change
;
and
a
private
*NL*
compartment
had
been
engaged
in
the
train
that
was
to
carry
the
young
*NL*
couple
to
their
unknown
destination
--
concealment
of
the
spot
in
which
*NL*
the
bridal
night
was
to
be
spent
being
one
of
the
most
sacred
taboos
of
*NL*
the
prehistoric
ritual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
the
ring
all
right
?
''
whispered
young
van
der
Luyden
Newland
,
who
*NL*
was
inexperienced
in
the
duties
of
a
best
man
,
and
awed
by
the
weight
*NL*
of
his
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
made
the
gesture
which
he
had
seen
so
many
bridegrooms
make
:
*NL*
with
his
ungloved
right
hand
he
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
dark
grey
*NL*
waistcoat
,
and
assured
himself
that
the
little
gold
circlet
-LRB-
engraved
*NL*
inside
:
Newland
to
May
,
April
--
,
187
-
-RRB-
was
in
its
place
;
then
,
*NL*
resuming
his
former
attitude
,
his
tall
hat
and
pearl-grey
gloves
with
*NL*
black
stitchings
grasped
in
his
left
hand
,
he
stood
looking
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overhead
,
Handel
's
March
swelled
pompously
through
the
imitation
stone
*NL*
vaulting
,
carrying
on
its
waves
the
faded
drift
of
the
many
weddings
at
*NL*
which
,
with
cheerful
indifference
,
he
had
stood
on
the
same
chancel
*NL*
step
watching
other
brides
float
up
the
nave
toward
other
bridegrooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
like
a
first
night
at
the
Opera
!
''
he
thought
,
recognising
all
the
*NL*
same
faces
in
the
same
boxes
-LRB-
no
,
pews
-RRB-
,
and
wondering
if
,
when
the
*NL*
Last
Trump
sounded
,
Mrs.
Selfridge
Merry
would
be
there
with
the
same
*NL*
towering
ostrich
feathers
in
her
bonnet
,
and
Mrs.
Beaufort
with
the
*NL*
same
diamond
earrings
and
the
same
smile
--
and
whether
suitable
*NL*
proscenium
seats
were
already
prepared
for
them
in
another
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
there
was
still
time
to
review
,
one
by
one
,
the
familiar
*NL*
countenances
in
the
first
rows
;
the
women
's
sharp
with
curiosity
and
*NL*
excitement
,
the
men
's
sulky
with
the
obligation
of
having
to
put
on
*NL*
their
frock-coats
before
luncheon
,
and
fight
for
food
at
the
*NL*
wedding-breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
bad
the
breakfast
is
at
old
Catherine
's
,
''
the
bridegroom
could
*NL*
fancy
Reggie
Chivers
saying
.
``
But
I
'm
told
that
Lovell
Mingott
*NL*
insisted
on
its
being
cooked
by
his
own
chef
,
so
it
ought
to
be
good
if
*NL*
one
can
only
get
at
it
.
''
And
he
could
imagine
Sillerton
Jackson
adding
*NL*
with
authority
:
``
My
dear
fellow
,
have
n't
you
heard
?
It
's
to
be
served
*NL*
at
small
tables
,
in
the
new
English
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
eyes
lingered
a
moment
on
the
left-hand
pew
,
where
his
mother
,
*NL*
who
had
entered
the
church
on
Mr.
Henry
van
der
Luyden
's
arm
,
sat
*NL*
weeping
softly
under
her
Chantilly
veil
,
her
hands
in
her
grandmother
's
*NL*
ermine
muff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Janey
!
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
his
sister
,
``
even
by
screwing
her
*NL*
head
around
she
can
see
only
the
people
in
the
few
front
pews
;
and
*NL*
they
're
mostly
dowdy
Newlands
and
Dagonets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
hither
side
of
the
white
ribbon
dividing
off
the
seats
reserved
*NL*
for
the
families
he
saw
Beaufort
,
tall
and
redfaced
,
scrutinising
the
*NL*
women
with
his
arrogant
stare
.
Beside
him
sat
his
wife
,
all
silvery
*NL*
chinchilla
and
violets
;
and
on
the
far
side
of
the
ribbon
,
Lawrence
*NL*
Lefferts
's
sleekly
brushed
head
seemed
to
mount
guard
over
the
*NL*
invisible
deity
of
``
Good
Form
''
who
presided
at
the
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
wondered
how
many
flaws
Lefferts
's
keen
eyes
would
discover
in
*NL*
the
ritual
of
his
divinity
;
then
he
suddenly
recalled
that
he
too
had
*NL*
once
thought
such
questions
important
.
The
things
that
had
filled
his
*NL*
days
seemed
now
like
a
nursery
parody
of
life
,
or
like
the
wrangles
of
*NL*
mediaeval
schoolmen
over
metaphysical
terms
that
nobody
had
ever
*NL*
understood
.
A
stormy
discussion
as
to
whether
the
wedding
presents
*NL*
should
be
``
shown
''
had
darkened
the
last
hours
before
the
wedding
;
and
*NL*
it
seemed
inconceivable
to
Archer
that
grown-up
people
should
work
*NL*
themselves
into
a
state
of
agitation
over
such
trifles
,
and
that
the
*NL*
matter
should
have
been
decided
-LRB-
in
the
negative
-RRB-
by
Mrs.
Welland
's
*NL*
saying
,
with
indignant
tears
:
``
I
should
as
soon
turn
the
reporters
*NL*
loose
in
my
house
.
''
Yet
there
was
a
time
when
Archer
had
had
definite
*NL*
and
rather
aggressive
opinions
on
all
such
problems
,
and
when
*NL*
everything
concerning
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
little
tribe
had
*NL*
seemed
to
him
fraught
with
world-wide
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
the
while
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
thought
,
``
real
people
were
living
*NL*
somewhere
,
and
real
things
happening
to
them
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
THERE
THEY
COME
!
''
breathed
the
best
man
excitedly
;
but
the
bridegroom
*NL*
knew
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cautious
opening
of
the
door
of
the
church
meant
only
that
Mr.
*NL*
Brown
the
livery-stable
keeper
-LRB-
gowned
in
black
in
his
intermittent
*NL*
character
of
sexton
-RRB-
was
taking
a
preliminary
survey
of
the
scene
*NL*
before
marshalling
his
forces
.
The
door
was
softly
shut
again
;
then
*NL*
after
another
interval
it
swung
majestically
open
,
and
a
murmur
ran
*NL*
through
the
church
:
``
The
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
came
first
,
on
the
arm
of
her
eldest
son
.
Her
large
pink
*NL*
face
was
appropriately
solemn
,
and
her
plum-coloured
satin
with
pale
*NL*
blue
side-panels
,
and
blue
ostrich
plumes
in
a
small
satin
bonnet
,
met
*NL*
with
general
approval
;
but
before
she
had
settled
herself
with
a
*NL*
stately
rustle
in
the
pew
opposite
Mrs.
Archer
's
the
spectators
were
*NL*
craning
their
necks
to
see
who
was
coming
after
her
.
Wild
rumours
had
*NL*
been
abroad
the
day
before
to
the
effect
that
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
physical
disabilities
,
had
resolved
on
being
present
at
*NL*
the
ceremony
;
and
the
idea
was
so
much
in
keeping
with
her
sporting
*NL*
character
that
bets
ran
high
at
the
clubs
as
to
her
being
able
to
walk
*NL*
up
the
nave
and
squeeze
into
a
seat
.
It
was
known
that
she
had
*NL*
insisted
on
sending
her
own
carpenter
to
look
into
the
possibility
of
*NL*
taking
down
the
end
panel
of
the
front
pew
,
and
to
measure
the
space
*NL*
between
the
seat
and
the
front
;
but
the
result
had
been
discouraging
,
*NL*
and
for
one
anxious
day
her
family
had
watched
her
dallying
with
the
*NL*
plan
of
being
wheeled
up
the
nave
in
her
enormous
Bath
chair
and
*NL*
sitting
enthroned
in
it
at
the
foot
of
the
chancel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
this
monstrous
exposure
of
her
person
was
so
painful
to
her
*NL*
relations
that
they
could
have
covered
with
gold
the
ingenious
person
*NL*
who
suddenly
discovered
that
the
chair
was
too
wide
to
pass
between
the
*NL*
iron
uprights
of
the
awning
which
extended
from
the
church
door
to
the
*NL*
curbstone
.
The
idea
of
doing
away
with
this
awning
,
and
revealing
the
*NL*
bride
to
the
mob
of
dressmakers
and
newspaper
reporters
who
stood
*NL*
outside
fighting
to
get
near
the
joints
of
the
canvas
,
exceeded
even
*NL*
old
Catherine
's
courage
,
though
for
a
moment
she
had
weighed
the
*NL*
possibility
.
``
Why
,
they
might
take
a
photograph
of
my
child
AND
PUT
IT
*NL*
IN
THE
PAPERS
!
''
Mrs.
Welland
exclaimed
when
her
mother
's
last
plan
was
*NL*
hinted
to
her
;
and
from
this
unthinkable
indecency
the
clan
recoiled
*NL*
with
a
collective
shudder
.
The
ancestress
had
had
to
give
in
;
but
her
*NL*
concession
was
bought
only
by
the
promise
that
the
wedding-breakfast
*NL*
should
take
place
under
her
roof
,
though
-LRB-
as
the
Washington
Square
*NL*
connection
said
-RRB-
with
the
Wellands
'
house
in
easy
reach
it
was
hard
to
*NL*
have
to
make
a
special
price
with
Brown
to
drive
one
to
the
other
end
*NL*
of
nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
all
these
transactions
had
been
widely
reported
by
the
Jacksons
*NL*
a
sporting
minority
still
clung
to
the
belief
that
old
Catherine
would
*NL*
appear
in
church
,
and
there
was
a
distinct
lowering
of
the
temperature
*NL*
when
she
was
found
to
have
been
replaced
by
her
daughter-in-law
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Lovell
Mingott
had
the
high
colour
and
glassy
stare
induced
in
ladies
*NL*
of
her
age
and
habit
by
the
effort
of
getting
into
a
new
dress
;
but
*NL*
once
the
disappointment
occasioned
by
her
mother-in-law
's
*NL*
non-appearance
had
subsided
,
it
was
agreed
that
her
black
Chantilly
*NL*
over
lilac
satin
,
with
a
bonnet
of
Parma
violets
,
formed
the
happiest
*NL*
contrast
to
Mrs.
Welland
's
blue
and
plum-colour
.
Far
different
was
the
*NL*
impression
produced
by
the
gaunt
and
mincing
lady
who
followed
on
Mr.
*NL*
Mingott
's
arm
,
in
a
wild
dishevelment
of
stripes
and
fringes
and
*NL*
floating
scarves
;
and
as
this
last
apparition
glided
into
view
Archer
's
*NL*
heart
contracted
and
stopped
beating
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
Marchioness
Manson
was
still
in
*NL*
Washington
,
where
she
had
gone
some
four
weeks
previously
with
her
*NL*
niece
,
Madame
Olenska
.
It
was
generally
understood
that
their
abrupt
*NL*
departure
was
due
to
Madame
Olenska
's
desire
to
remove
her
aunt
from
*NL*
the
baleful
eloquence
of
Dr.
Agathon
Carver
,
who
had
nearly
succeeded
*NL*
in
enlisting
her
as
a
recruit
for
the
Valley
of
Love
;
and
in
the
*NL*
circumstances
no
one
had
expected
either
of
the
ladies
to
return
for
*NL*
the
wedding
.
For
a
moment
Archer
stood
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
Medora
's
*NL*
fantastic
figure
,
straining
to
see
who
came
behind
her
;
but
the
little
*NL*
procession
was
at
an
end
,
for
all
the
lesser
members
of
the
family
had
*NL*
taken
their
seats
,
and
the
eight
tall
ushers
,
gathering
themselves
*NL*
together
like
birds
or
insects
preparing
for
some
migratory
manoeuvre
,
*NL*
were
already
slipping
through
the
side
doors
into
the
lobby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
--
I
say
:
SHE
'S
HERE
!
''
the
best
man
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
roused
himself
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
time
had
apparently
passed
since
his
heart
had
stopped
beating
,
*NL*
for
the
white
and
rosy
procession
was
in
fact
half
way
up
the
nave
,
the
*NL*
Bishop
,
the
Rector
and
two
white-winged
assistants
were
hovering
about
*NL*
the
flower-banked
altar
,
and
the
first
chords
of
the
Spohr
symphony
*NL*
were
strewing
their
flower-like
notes
before
the
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
opened
his
eyes
-LRB-
but
could
they
really
have
been
shut
,
as
he
*NL*
imagined
?
-RRB-
,
and
felt
his
heart
beginning
to
resume
its
usual
task
.
The
*NL*
music
,
the
scent
of
the
lilies
on
the
altar
,
the
vision
of
the
cloud
of
*NL*
tulle
and
orange-blossoms
floating
nearer
and
nearer
,
the
sight
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
's
face
suddenly
convulsed
with
happy
sobs
,
the
low
benedictory
*NL*
murmur
of
the
Rector
's
voice
,
the
ordered
evolutions
of
the
eight
pink
*NL*
bridesmaids
and
the
eight
black
ushers
:
all
these
sights
,
sounds
and
*NL*
sensations
,
so
familiar
in
themselves
,
so
unutterably
strange
and
*NL*
meaningless
in
his
new
relation
to
them
,
were
confusedly
mingled
in
his
*NL*
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
''
he
thought
,
``
HAVE
I
got
the
ring
?
''
--
and
once
more
he
went
*NL*
through
the
bridegroom
's
convulsive
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
in
a
moment
,
May
was
beside
him
,
such
radiance
streaming
from
her
*NL*
that
it
sent
a
faint
warmth
through
his
numbness
,
and
he
straightened
*NL*
himself
and
smiled
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearly
beloved
,
we
are
gathered
together
here
,
''
the
Rector
began
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
ring
was
on
her
hand
,
the
Bishop
's
benediction
had
been
given
,
the
*NL*
bridesmaids
were
a-poise
to
resume
their
place
in
the
procession
,
and
*NL*
the
organ
was
showing
preliminary
symptoms
of
breaking
out
into
the
*NL*
Mendelssohn
March
,
without
which
no
newly-wedded
couple
had
ever
*NL*
emerged
upon
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
arm
--
I
SAY
,
GIVE
HER
YOUR
ARM
!
''
young
Newland
nervously
hissed
;
*NL*
and
once
more
Archer
became
aware
of
having
been
adrift
far
off
in
the
*NL*
unknown
.
What
was
it
that
had
sent
him
there
,
he
wondered
?
Perhaps
*NL*
the
glimpse
,
among
the
anonymous
spectators
in
the
transept
,
of
a
dark
*NL*
coil
of
hair
under
a
hat
which
,
a
moment
later
,
revealed
itself
as
*NL*
belonging
to
an
unknown
lady
with
a
long
nose
,
so
laughably
unlike
the
*NL*
person
whose
image
she
had
evoked
that
he
asked
himself
if
he
were
*NL*
becoming
subject
to
hallucinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
he
and
his
wife
were
pacing
slowly
down
the
nave
,
carried
*NL*
forward
on
the
light
Mendelssohn
ripples
,
the
spring
day
beckoning
to
*NL*
them
through
widely
opened
doors
,
and
Mrs.
Welland
's
chestnuts
,
with
*NL*
big
white
favours
on
their
frontlets
,
curvetting
and
showing
off
at
the
*NL*
far
end
of
the
canvas
tunnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
,
who
had
a
still
bigger
white
favour
on
his
lapel
,
wrapped
*NL*
May
's
white
cloak
about
her
,
and
Archer
jumped
into
the
brougham
at
her
*NL*
side
.
She
turned
to
him
with
a
triumphant
smile
and
their
hands
*NL*
clasped
under
her
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darling
!
''
Archer
said
--
and
suddenly
the
same
black
abyss
yawned
before
*NL*
him
and
he
felt
himself
sinking
into
it
,
deeper
and
deeper
,
while
his
*NL*
voice
rambled
on
smoothly
and
cheerfully
:
``
Yes
,
of
course
I
thought
*NL*
I
'd
lost
the
ring
;
no
wedding
would
be
complete
if
the
poor
devil
of
a
*NL*
bridegroom
did
n't
go
through
that
.
But
you
DID
keep
me
waiting
,
you
*NL*
know
!
I
had
time
to
think
of
every
horror
that
might
possibly
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
surprised
him
by
turning
,
in
full
Fifth
Avenue
,
and
flinging
her
*NL*
arms
about
his
neck
.
``
But
none
ever
CAN
happen
now
,
can
it
,
Newland
,
*NL*
as
long
as
we
two
are
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
detail
of
the
day
had
been
so
carefully
thought
out
that
the
*NL*
young
couple
,
after
the
wedding-breakfast
,
had
ample
time
to
put
on
*NL*
their
travelling-clothes
,
descend
the
wide
Mingott
stairs
between
*NL*
laughing
bridesmaids
and
weeping
parents
,
and
get
into
the
brougham
*NL*
under
the
traditional
shower
of
rice
and
satin
slippers
;
and
there
was
*NL*
still
half
an
hour
left
in
which
to
drive
to
the
station
,
buy
the
last
*NL*
weeklies
at
the
bookstall
with
the
air
of
seasoned
travellers
,
and
*NL*
settle
themselves
in
the
reserved
compartment
in
which
May
's
maid
had
*NL*
already
placed
her
dove-coloured
travelling
cloak
and
glaringly
new
*NL*
dressing-bag
from
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
du
Lac
aunts
at
Rhinebeck
had
put
their
house
at
the
disposal
*NL*
of
the
bridal
couple
,
with
a
readiness
inspired
by
the
prospect
of
*NL*
spending
a
week
in
New
York
with
Mrs.
Archer
;
and
Archer
,
glad
to
*NL*
escape
the
usual
``
bridal
suite
''
in
a
Philadelphia
or
Baltimore
hotel
,
*NL*
had
accepted
with
an
equal
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
was
enchanted
at
the
idea
of
going
to
the
country
,
and
childishly
*NL*
amused
at
the
vain
efforts
of
the
eight
bridesmaids
to
discover
where
*NL*
their
mysterious
retreat
was
situated
.
It
was
thought
``
very
English
''
*NL*
to
have
a
country-house
lent
to
one
,
and
the
fact
gave
a
last
touch
of
*NL*
distinction
to
what
was
generally
conceded
to
be
the
most
brilliant
*NL*
wedding
of
the
year
;
but
where
the
house
was
no
one
was
permitted
to
*NL*
know
,
except
the
parents
of
bride
and
groom
,
who
,
when
taxed
with
the
*NL*
knowledge
,
pursed
their
lips
and
said
mysteriously
:
``
Ah
,
they
did
n't
*NL*
tell
us
--
''
which
was
manifestly
true
,
since
there
was
no
need
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
they
were
settled
in
their
compartment
,
and
the
train
,
shaking
off
*NL*
the
endless
wooden
suburbs
,
had
pushed
out
into
the
pale
landscape
of
*NL*
spring
,
talk
became
easier
than
Archer
had
expected
.
May
was
still
,
in
*NL*
look
and
tone
,
the
simple
girl
of
yesterday
,
eager
to
compare
notes
*NL*
with
him
as
to
the
incidents
of
the
wedding
,
and
discussing
them
as
*NL*
impartially
as
a
bridesmaid
talking
it
all
over
with
an
usher
.
At
*NL*
first
Archer
had
fancied
that
this
detachment
was
the
disguise
of
an
*NL*
inward
tremor
;
but
her
clear
eyes
revealed
only
the
most
tranquil
*NL*
unawareness
.
She
was
alone
for
the
first
time
with
her
husband
;
but
*NL*
her
husband
was
only
the
charming
comrade
of
yesterday
.
There
was
no
*NL*
one
whom
she
liked
as
much
,
no
one
whom
she
trusted
as
completely
,
and
*NL*
the
culminating
``
lark
''
of
the
whole
delightful
adventure
of
engagement
*NL*
and
marriage
was
to
be
off
with
him
alone
on
a
journey
,
like
a
grownup
*NL*
person
,
like
a
``
married
woman
,
''
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wonderful
that
--
as
he
had
learned
in
the
Mission
garden
at
St.
*NL*
Augustine
--
such
depths
of
feeling
could
coexist
with
such
absence
of
*NL*
imagination
.
But
he
remembered
how
,
even
then
,
she
had
surprised
him
*NL*
by
dropping
back
to
inexpressive
girlishness
as
soon
as
her
conscience
*NL*
had
been
eased
of
its
burden
;
and
he
saw
that
she
would
probably
go
*NL*
through
life
dealing
to
the
best
of
her
ability
with
each
experience
as
*NL*
it
came
,
but
never
anticipating
any
by
so
much
as
a
stolen
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
that
faculty
of
unawareness
was
what
gave
her
eyes
their
*NL*
transparency
,
and
her
face
the
look
of
representing
a
type
rather
than
*NL*
a
person
;
as
if
she
might
have
been
chosen
to
pose
for
a
Civic
Virtue
*NL*
or
a
Greek
goddess
.
The
blood
that
ran
so
close
to
her
fair
skin
might
*NL*
have
been
a
preserving
fluid
rather
than
a
ravaging
element
;
yet
her
*NL*
look
of
indestructible
youthfulness
made
her
seem
neither
hard
nor
*NL*
dull
,
but
only
primitive
and
pure
.
In
the
thick
of
this
meditation
*NL*
Archer
suddenly
felt
himself
looking
at
her
with
the
startled
gaze
of
a
*NL*
stranger
,
and
plunged
into
a
reminiscence
of
the
wedding-breakfast
and
*NL*
of
Granny
Mingott
's
immense
and
triumphant
pervasion
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
settled
down
to
frank
enjoyment
of
the
subject
.
``
I
was
surprised
,
*NL*
though
--
were
n't
you
?
--
that
aunt
Medora
came
after
all
.
Ellen
wrote
*NL*
that
they
were
neither
of
them
well
enough
to
take
the
journey
;
I
do
*NL*
wish
it
had
been
she
who
had
recovered
!
Did
you
see
the
exquisite
old
*NL*
lace
she
sent
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
known
that
the
moment
must
come
sooner
or
later
,
but
he
had
*NL*
somewhat
imagined
that
by
force
of
willing
he
might
hold
it
at
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
--
no
:
yes
,
it
was
beautiful
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
blindly
,
*NL*
and
wondering
if
,
whenever
he
heard
those
two
syllables
,
all
his
*NL*
carefully
built-up
world
would
tumble
about
him
like
a
house
of
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
tired
?
It
will
be
good
to
have
some
tea
when
we
*NL*
arrive
--
I
'm
sure
the
aunts
have
got
everything
beautifully
ready
,
''
he
*NL*
rattled
on
,
taking
her
hand
in
his
;
and
her
mind
rushed
away
instantly
*NL*
to
the
magnificent
tea
and
coffee
service
of
Baltimore
silver
which
the
*NL*
Beauforts
had
sent
,
and
which
``
went
''
so
perfectly
with
uncle
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
's
trays
and
side-dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
twilight
the
train
stopped
at
the
Rhinebeck
station
,
and
*NL*
they
walked
along
the
platform
to
the
waiting
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
awfully
kind
of
the
van
der
Luydens
--
they
've
sent
their
man
*NL*
over
from
Skuytercliff
to
meet
us
,
''
Archer
exclaimed
,
as
a
sedate
*NL*
person
out
of
livery
approached
them
and
relieved
the
maid
of
her
bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
extremely
sorry
,
sir
,
''
said
this
emissary
,
``
that
a
little
accident
*NL*
has
occurred
at
the
Miss
du
Lacs
'
:
a
leak
in
the
water-tank
.
It
*NL*
happened
yesterday
,
and
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
,
who
heard
of
it
this
*NL*
morning
,
sent
a
housemaid
up
by
the
early
train
to
get
the
Patroon
's
*NL*
house
ready
.
It
will
be
quite
comfortable
,
I
think
you
'll
find
,
sir
;
*NL*
and
the
Miss
du
Lacs
have
sent
their
cook
over
,
so
that
it
will
be
*NL*
exactly
the
same
as
if
you
'd
been
at
Rhinebeck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
stared
at
the
speaker
so
blankly
that
he
repeated
in
still
more
*NL*
apologetic
accents
:
``
It
'll
be
exactly
the
same
,
sir
,
I
do
assure
*NL*
you
--
''
and
May
's
eager
voice
broke
out
,
covering
the
embarrassed
*NL*
silence
:
``
The
same
as
Rhinebeck
?
The
Patroon
's
house
?
But
it
will
be
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
times
better
--
wo
n't
it
,
Newland
?
It
's
too
dear
and
*NL*
kind
of
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
to
have
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
they
drove
off
,
with
the
maid
beside
the
coachman
,
and
their
*NL*
shining
bridal
bags
on
the
seat
before
them
,
she
went
on
excitedly
:
*NL*
``
Only
fancy
,
I
've
never
been
inside
it
--
have
you
?
The
van
der
Luydens
*NL*
show
it
to
so
few
people
.
But
they
opened
it
for
Ellen
,
it
seems
,
and
*NL*
she
told
me
what
a
darling
little
place
it
was
:
she
says
it
's
the
only
*NL*
house
she
's
seen
in
America
that
she
could
imagine
being
perfectly
*NL*
happy
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
that
's
what
we
're
going
to
be
,
is
n't
it
?
''
cried
her
husband
*NL*
gaily
;
and
she
answered
with
her
boyish
smile
:
``
Ah
,
it
's
just
our
luck
*NL*
beginning
--
the
wonderful
luck
we
're
always
going
to
have
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XX
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
must
dine
with
Mrs.
Carfry
,
dearest
,
''
Archer
said
;
and
*NL*
his
wife
looked
at
him
with
an
anxious
frown
across
the
monumental
*NL*
Britannia
ware
of
their
lodging
house
breakfast-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
rainy
desert
of
autumnal
London
there
were
only
two
people
*NL*
whom
the
Newland
Archers
knew
;
and
these
two
they
had
sedulously
*NL*
avoided
,
in
conformity
with
the
old
New
York
tradition
that
it
was
not
*NL*
``
dignified
''
to
force
one
's
self
on
the
notice
of
one
's
acquaintances
in
*NL*
foreign
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
and
Janey
,
in
the
course
of
their
visits
to
Europe
,
had
so
*NL*
unflinchingly
lived
up
to
this
principle
,
and
met
the
friendly
advances
*NL*
of
their
fellow-travellers
with
an
air
of
such
impenetrable
reserve
,
*NL*
that
they
had
almost
achieved
the
record
of
never
having
exchanged
a
*NL*
word
with
a
``
foreigner
''
other
than
those
employed
in
hotels
and
*NL*
railway-stations
.
Their
own
compatriots
--
save
those
previously
known
*NL*
or
properly
accredited
--
they
treated
with
an
even
more
pronounced
*NL*
disdain
;
so
that
,
unless
they
ran
across
a
Chivers
,
a
Dagonet
or
a
*NL*
Mingott
,
their
months
abroad
were
spent
in
an
unbroken
tete-a-tete
.
*NL*
But
the
utmost
precautions
are
sometimes
unavailing
;
and
one
night
at
*NL*
Botzen
one
of
the
two
English
ladies
in
the
room
across
the
passage
*NL*
-LRB-
whose
names
,
dress
and
social
situation
were
already
intimately
known
*NL*
to
Janey
-RRB-
had
knocked
on
the
door
and
asked
if
Mrs.
Archer
had
a
bottle
*NL*
of
liniment
.
The
other
lady
--
the
intruder
's
sister
,
Mrs.
Carfry
--
had
*NL*
been
seized
with
a
sudden
attack
of
bronchitis
;
and
Mrs.
Archer
,
who
*NL*
never
travelled
without
a
complete
family
pharmacy
,
was
fortunately
*NL*
able
to
produce
the
required
remedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Carfry
was
very
ill
,
and
as
she
and
her
sister
Miss
Harle
were
*NL*
travelling
alone
they
were
profoundly
grateful
to
the
Archer
ladies
,
*NL*
who
supplied
them
with
ingenious
comforts
and
whose
efficient
maid
*NL*
helped
to
nurse
the
invalid
back
to
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Archers
left
Botzen
they
had
no
idea
of
ever
seeing
Mrs.
*NL*
Carfry
and
Miss
Harle
again
.
Nothing
,
to
Mrs.
Archer
's
mind
,
would
*NL*
have
been
more
``
undignified
''
than
to
force
one
's
self
on
the
notice
of
*NL*
a
``
foreigner
''
to
whom
one
had
happened
to
render
an
accidental
service
.
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Carfry
and
her
sister
,
to
whom
this
point
of
view
was
unknown
,
*NL*
and
who
would
have
found
it
utterly
incomprehensible
,
felt
themselves
*NL*
linked
by
an
eternal
gratitude
to
the
``
delightful
Americans
''
who
had
*NL*
been
so
kind
at
Botzen
.
With
touching
fidelity
they
seized
every
*NL*
chance
of
meeting
Mrs.
Archer
and
Janey
in
the
course
of
their
*NL*
continental
travels
,
and
displayed
a
supernatural
acuteness
in
finding
*NL*
out
when
they
were
to
pass
through
London
on
their
way
to
or
from
the
*NL*
States
.
The
intimacy
became
indissoluble
,
and
Mrs.
Archer
and
Janey
,
*NL*
whenever
they
alighted
at
Brown
's
Hotel
,
found
themselves
awaited
by
*NL*
two
affectionate
friends
who
,
like
themselves
,
cultivated
ferns
in
*NL*
Wardian
cases
,
made
macrame
lace
,
read
the
memoirs
of
the
Baroness
*NL*
Bunsen
and
had
views
about
the
occupants
of
the
leading
London
pulpits
.
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Archer
said
,
it
made
``
another
thing
of
London
''
to
know
Mrs.
*NL*
Carfry
and
Miss
Harle
;
and
by
the
time
that
Newland
became
engaged
the
*NL*
tie
between
the
families
was
so
firmly
established
that
it
was
thought
*NL*
``
only
right
''
to
send
a
wedding
invitation
to
the
two
English
ladies
,
*NL*
who
sent
,
in
return
,
a
pretty
bouquet
of
pressed
Alpine
flowers
under
*NL*
glass
.
And
on
the
dock
,
when
Newland
and
his
wife
sailed
for
England
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
's
last
word
had
been
:
``
You
must
take
May
to
see
Mrs.
*NL*
Carfry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
and
his
wife
had
had
no
idea
of
obeying
this
injunction
;
but
*NL*
Mrs.
Carfry
,
with
her
usual
acuteness
,
had
run
them
down
and
sent
them
*NL*
an
invitation
to
dine
;
and
it
was
over
this
invitation
that
May
Archer
*NL*
was
wrinkling
her
brows
across
the
tea
and
muffins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
,
Newland
;
you
KNOW
them
.
But
I
shall
feel
*NL*
so
shy
among
a
lot
of
people
I
've
never
met
.
And
what
shall
I
wear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
at
her
.
She
looked
*NL*
handsomer
and
more
Diana-like
than
ever
.
The
moist
English
air
seemed
*NL*
to
have
deepened
the
bloom
of
her
cheeks
and
softened
the
slight
*NL*
hardness
of
her
virginal
features
;
or
else
it
was
simply
the
inner
glow
*NL*
of
happiness
,
shining
through
like
a
light
under
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wear
,
dearest
?
I
thought
a
trunkful
of
things
had
come
from
Paris
*NL*
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
.
I
meant
to
say
that
I
sha
n't
know
WHICH
to
wear
.
''
*NL*
She
pouted
a
little
.
``
I
've
never
dined
out
in
London
;
and
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
be
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
enter
into
her
perplexity
.
``
But
do
n't
Englishwomen
dress
*NL*
just
like
everybody
else
in
the
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
!
How
can
you
ask
such
funny
questions
?
When
they
go
to
the
*NL*
theatre
in
old
ball-dresses
and
bare
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
they
wear
new
ball-dresses
at
home
;
but
at
any
rate
Mrs.
*NL*
Carfry
and
Miss
Harle
wo
n't
.
They
'll
wear
caps
like
my
mother
's
--
and
*NL*
shawls
;
very
soft
shawls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
how
will
the
other
women
be
dressed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
well
as
you
,
dear
,
''
he
rejoined
,
wondering
what
had
suddenly
*NL*
developed
in
her
Janey
's
morbid
interest
in
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pushed
back
her
chair
with
a
sigh
.
``
That
's
dear
of
you
,
Newland
;
*NL*
but
it
does
n't
help
me
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
an
inspiration
.
``
Why
not
wear
your
wedding-dress
?
That
ca
n't
*NL*
be
wrong
,
can
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dearest
!
If
I
only
had
it
here
!
But
it
's
gone
to
Paris
to
be
*NL*
made
over
for
next
winter
,
and
Worth
has
n't
sent
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
''
said
Archer
,
getting
up
.
``
Look
here
--
the
fog
's
lifting
.
*NL*
If
we
made
a
dash
for
the
National
Gallery
we
might
manage
to
catch
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
pictures

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Newland
Archers
were
on
their
way
home
,
after
a
three
months
'
*NL*
wedding-tour
which
May
,
in
writing
to
her
girl
friends
,
vaguely
*NL*
summarised
as
``
blissful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
gone
to
the
Italian
Lakes
:
on
reflection
,
Archer
had
not
*NL*
been
able
to
picture
his
wife
in
that
particular
setting
.
Her
own
*NL*
inclination
-LRB-
after
a
month
with
the
Paris
dressmakers
-RRB-
was
for
*NL*
mountaineering
in
July
and
swimming
in
August
.
This
plan
they
*NL*
punctually
fulfilled
,
spending
July
at
Interlaken
and
Grindelwald
,
and
*NL*
August
at
a
little
place
called
Etretat
,
on
the
Normandy
coast
,
which
*NL*
some
one
had
recommended
as
quaint
and
quiet
.
Once
or
twice
,
in
the
*NL*
mountains
,
Archer
had
pointed
southward
and
said
:
``
There
's
Italy
''
;
and
*NL*
May
,
her
feet
in
a
gentian-bed
,
had
smiled
cheerfully
,
and
replied
:
*NL*
``
It
would
be
lovely
to
go
there
next
winter
,
if
only
you
did
n't
have
to
*NL*
be
in
New
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
reality
travelling
interested
her
even
less
than
he
had
*NL*
expected
.
She
regarded
it
-LRB-
once
her
clothes
were
ordered
-RRB-
as
merely
an
*NL*
enlarged
opportunity
for
walking
,
riding
,
swimming
,
and
trying
her
hand
*NL*
at
the
fascinating
new
game
of
lawn
tennis
;
and
when
they
finally
got
*NL*
back
to
London
-LRB-
where
they
were
to
spend
a
fortnight
while
he
ordered
*NL*
HIS
clothes
-RRB-
she
no
longer
concealed
the
eagerness
with
which
she
*NL*
looked
forward
to
sailing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
London
nothing
interested
her
but
the
theatres
and
the
shops
;
and
*NL*
she
found
the
theatres
less
exciting
than
the
Paris
cafes
chantants
*NL*
where
,
under
the
blossoming
horse-chestnuts
of
the
Champs
Elysees
,
she
*NL*
had
had
the
novel
experience
of
looking
down
from
the
restaurant
*NL*
terrace
on
an
audience
of
``
cocottes
,
''
and
having
her
husband
interpret
*NL*
to
her
as
much
of
the
songs
as
he
thought
suitable
for
bridal
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
reverted
to
all
his
old
inherited
ideas
about
marriage
.
It
*NL*
was
less
trouble
to
conform
with
the
tradition
and
treat
May
exactly
as
*NL*
all
his
friends
treated
their
wives
than
to
try
to
put
into
practice
*NL*
the
theories
with
which
his
untrammelled
bachelorhood
had
dallied
.
*NL*
There
was
no
use
in
trying
to
emancipate
a
wife
who
had
not
the
dimmest
*NL*
notion
that
she
was
not
free
;
and
he
had
long
since
discovered
that
*NL*
May
's
only
use
of
the
liberty
she
supposed
herself
to
possess
would
be
*NL*
to
lay
it
on
the
altar
of
her
wifely
adoration
.
Her
innate
dignity
*NL*
would
always
keep
her
from
making
the
gift
abjectly
;
and
a
day
might
*NL*
even
come
-LRB-
as
it
once
had
-RRB-
when
she
would
find
strength
to
take
it
*NL*
altogether
back
if
she
thought
she
were
doing
it
for
his
own
good
.
But
*NL*
with
a
conception
of
marriage
so
uncomplicated
and
incurious
as
hers
*NL*
such
a
crisis
could
be
brought
about
only
by
something
visibly
*NL*
outrageous
in
his
own
conduct
;
and
the
fineness
of
her
feeling
for
him
*NL*
made
that
unthinkable
.
Whatever
happened
,
he
knew
,
she
would
always
be
*NL*
loyal
,
gallant
and
unresentful
;
and
that
pledged
him
to
the
practice
of
*NL*
the
same
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
tended
to
draw
him
back
into
his
old
habits
of
mind
.
If
her
*NL*
simplicity
had
been
the
simplicity
of
pettiness
he
would
have
chafed
*NL*
and
rebelled
;
but
since
the
lines
of
her
character
,
though
so
few
,
were
*NL*
on
the
same
fine
mould
as
her
face
,
she
became
the
tutelary
divinity
of
*NL*
all
his
old
traditions
and
reverences
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
qualities
were
scarcely
of
the
kind
to
enliven
foreign
travel
,
*NL*
though
they
made
her
so
easy
and
pleasant
a
companion
;
but
he
saw
at
*NL*
once
how
they
would
fall
into
place
in
their
proper
setting
.
He
had
no
*NL*
fear
of
being
oppressed
by
them
,
for
his
artistic
and
intellectual
life
*NL*
would
go
on
,
as
it
always
had
,
outside
the
domestic
circle
;
and
within
*NL*
it
there
would
be
nothing
small
and
stifling
--
coming
back
to
his
wife
*NL*
would
never
be
like
entering
a
stuffy
room
after
a
tramp
in
the
open
.
*NL*
And
when
they
had
children
the
vacant
corners
in
both
their
lives
would
*NL*
be
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
went
through
his
mind
during
their
long
slow
drive
*NL*
from
Mayfair
to
South
Kensington
,
where
Mrs.
Carfry
and
her
sister
*NL*
lived
.
Archer
too
would
have
preferred
to
escape
their
friends
'
*NL*
hospitality
:
in
conformity
with
the
family
tradition
he
had
always
*NL*
travelled
as
a
sight-seer
and
looker-on
,
affecting
a
haughty
*NL*
unconsciousness
of
the
presence
of
his
fellow-beings
.
Once
only
,
just
*NL*
after
Harvard
,
he
had
spent
a
few
gay
weeks
at
Florence
with
a
band
of
*NL*
queer
Europeanised
Americans
,
dancing
all
night
with
titled
ladies
in
*NL*
palaces
,
and
gambling
half
the
day
with
the
rakes
and
dandies
of
the
*NL*
fashionable
club
;
but
it
had
all
seemed
to
him
,
though
the
greatest
fun
*NL*
in
the
world
,
as
unreal
as
a
carnival
.
These
queer
cosmopolitan
women
,
*NL*
deep
in
complicated
love-affairs
which
they
appeared
to
feel
the
need
*NL*
of
retailing
to
every
one
they
met
,
and
the
magnificent
young
officers
*NL*
and
elderly
dyed
wits
who
were
the
subjects
or
the
recipients
of
their
*NL*
confidences
,
were
too
different
from
the
people
Archer
had
grown
up
*NL*
among
,
too
much
like
expensive
and
rather
malodorous
hot-house
exotics
,
*NL*
to
detain
his
imagination
long
.
To
introduce
his
wife
into
such
a
*NL*
society
was
out
of
the
question
;
and
in
the
course
of
his
travels
no
*NL*
other
had
shown
any
marked
eagerness
for
his
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
their
arrival
in
London
he
had
run
across
the
Duke
of
*NL*
St.
Austrey
,
and
the
Duke
,
instantly
and
cordially
recognising
him
,
had
*NL*
said
:
``
Look
me
up
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
--
but
no
proper-spirited
American
would
*NL*
have
considered
that
a
suggestion
to
be
acted
on
,
and
the
meeting
was
*NL*
without
a
sequel
.
They
had
even
managed
to
avoid
May
's
English
aunt
,
*NL*
the
banker
's
wife
,
who
was
still
in
Yorkshire
;
in
fact
,
they
had
*NL*
purposely
postponed
going
to
London
till
the
autumn
in
order
that
their
*NL*
arrival
during
the
season
might
not
appear
pushing
and
snobbish
to
*NL*
these
unknown
relatives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
there
'll
be
nobody
at
Mrs.
Carfry
's
--
London
's
a
desert
at
*NL*
this
season
,
and
you
've
made
yourself
much
too
beautiful
,
''
Archer
said
*NL*
to
May
,
who
sat
at
his
side
in
the
hansom
so
spotlessly
splendid
in
her
*NL*
sky-blue
cloak
edged
with
swansdown
that
it
seemed
wicked
to
expose
her
*NL*
to
the
London
grime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
them
to
think
that
we
dress
like
savages
,
''
she
replied
,
*NL*
with
a
scorn
that
Pocahontas
might
have
resented
;
and
he
was
struck
*NL*
again
by
the
religious
reverence
of
even
the
most
unworldly
American
*NL*
women
for
the
social
advantages
of
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
their
armour
,
''
he
thought
,
``
their
defence
against
the
unknown
,
*NL*
and
their
defiance
of
it
.
''
And
he
understood
for
the
first
time
the
*NL*
earnestness
with
which
May
,
who
was
incapable
of
tying
a
ribbon
in
her
*NL*
hair
to
charm
him
,
had
gone
through
the
solemn
rite
of
selecting
and
*NL*
ordering
her
extensive
wardrobe
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
right
in
expecting
the
party
at
Mrs.
Carfry
's
to
be
a
small
*NL*
one
.
Besides
their
hostess
and
her
sister
,
they
found
,
in
the
long
*NL*
chilly
drawing-room
,
only
another
shawled
lady
,
a
genial
Vicar
who
was
*NL*
her
husband
,
a
silent
lad
whom
Mrs.
Carfry
named
as
her
nephew
,
and
a
*NL*
small
dark
gentleman
with
lively
eyes
whom
she
introduced
as
his
tutor
,
*NL*
pronouncing
a
French
name
as
she
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
dimly-lit
and
dim-featured
group
May
Archer
floated
like
a
*NL*
swan
with
the
sunset
on
her
:
she
seemed
larger
,
fairer
,
more
*NL*
voluminously
rustling
than
her
husband
had
ever
seen
her
;
and
he
*NL*
perceived
that
the
rosiness
and
rustlingness
were
the
tokens
of
an
*NL*
extreme
and
infantile
shyness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
will
they
expect
me
to
talk
about
?
''
her
helpless
eyes
*NL*
implored
him
,
at
the
very
moment
that
her
dazzling
apparition
was
*NL*
calling
forth
the
same
anxiety
in
their
own
bosoms
.
But
beauty
,
even
*NL*
when
distrustful
of
itself
,
awakens
confidence
in
the
manly
heart
;
and
*NL*
the
Vicar
and
the
French-named
tutor
were
soon
manifesting
to
May
their
*NL*
desire
to
put
her
at
her
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
their
best
efforts
,
however
,
the
dinner
was
a
languishing
*NL*
affair
.
Archer
noticed
that
his
wife
's
way
of
showing
herself
at
her
*NL*
ease
with
foreigners
was
to
become
more
uncompromisingly
local
in
her
*NL*
references
,
so
that
,
though
her
loveliness
was
an
encouragement
to
*NL*
admiration
,
her
conversation
was
a
chill
to
repartee
.
The
Vicar
soon
*NL*
abandoned
the
struggle
;
but
the
tutor
,
who
spoke
the
most
fluent
and
*NL*
accomplished
English
,
gallantly
continued
to
pour
it
out
to
her
until
*NL*
the
ladies
,
to
the
manifest
relief
of
all
concerned
,
went
up
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vicar
,
after
a
glass
of
port
,
was
obliged
to
hurry
away
to
a
*NL*
meeting
,
and
the
shy
nephew
,
who
appeared
to
be
an
invalid
,
was
packed
*NL*
off
to
bed
.
But
Archer
and
the
tutor
continued
to
sit
over
their
wine
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
Archer
found
himself
talking
as
he
had
not
done
since
his
*NL*
last
symposium
with
Ned
Winsett
.
The
Carfry
nephew
,
it
turned
out
,
had
*NL*
been
threatened
with
consumption
,
and
had
had
to
leave
Harrow
for
*NL*
Switzerland
,
where
he
had
spent
two
years
in
the
milder
air
of
Lake
*NL*
Leman
.
Being
a
bookish
youth
,
he
had
been
entrusted
to
M.
Riviere
,
who
*NL*
had
brought
him
back
to
England
,
and
was
to
remain
with
him
till
he
*NL*
went
up
to
Oxford
the
following
spring
;
and
M.
Riviere
added
with
*NL*
simplicity
that
he
should
then
have
to
look
out
for
another
job
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
impossible
,
Archer
thought
,
that
he
should
be
long
without
*NL*
one
,
so
varied
were
his
interests
and
so
many
his
gifts
.
He
was
a
man
*NL*
of
about
thirty
,
with
a
thin
ugly
face
-LRB-
May
would
certainly
have
called
*NL*
him
common-looking
-RRB-
to
which
the
play
of
his
ideas
gave
an
intense
*NL*
expressiveness
;
but
there
was
nothing
frivolous
or
cheap
in
his
*NL*
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
,
who
had
died
young
,
had
filled
a
small
diplomatic
post
,
and
*NL*
it
had
been
intended
that
the
son
should
follow
the
same
career
;
but
an
*NL*
insatiable
taste
for
letters
had
thrown
the
young
man
into
journalism
,
*NL*
then
into
authorship
-LRB-
apparently
unsuccessful
-RRB-
,
and
at
length
--
after
*NL*
other
experiments
and
vicissitudes
which
he
spared
his
listener
--
into
*NL*
tutoring
English
youths
in
Switzerland
.
Before
that
,
however
,
he
had
*NL*
lived
much
in
Paris
,
frequented
the
Goncourt
grenier
,
been
advised
by
*NL*
Maupassant
not
to
attempt
to
write
-LRB-
even
that
seemed
to
Archer
a
*NL*
dazzling
honour
!
-RRB-
,
and
had
often
talked
with
Merimee
in
his
mother
's
*NL*
house
.
He
had
obviously
always
been
desperately
poor
and
anxious
*NL*
-LRB-
having
a
mother
and
an
unmarried
sister
to
provide
for
-RRB-
,
and
it
was
*NL*
apparent
that
his
literary
ambitions
had
failed
.
His
situation
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
seemed
,
materially
speaking
,
no
more
brilliant
than
Ned
*NL*
Winsett
's
;
but
he
had
lived
in
a
world
in
which
,
as
he
said
,
no
one
who
*NL*
loved
ideas
need
hunger
mentally
.
As
it
was
precisely
of
that
love
*NL*
that
poor
Winsett
was
starving
to
death
,
Archer
looked
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
vicarious
envy
at
this
eager
impecunious
young
man
who
had
fared
so
*NL*
richly
in
his
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
Monsieur
,
it
's
worth
everything
,
is
n't
it
,
to
keep
one
's
*NL*
intellectual
liberty
,
not
to
enslave
one
's
powers
of
appreciation
,
*NL*
one
's
critical
independence
?
It
was
because
of
that
that
I
abandoned
*NL*
journalism
,
and
took
to
so
much
duller
work
:
tutoring
and
private
*NL*
secretaryship
.
There
is
a
good
deal
of
drudgery
,
of
course
;
but
one
*NL*
preserves
one
's
moral
freedom
,
what
we
call
in
French
one
's
quant
a
*NL*
soi
.
And
when
one
hears
good
talk
one
can
join
in
it
without
*NL*
compromising
any
opinions
but
one
's
own
;
or
one
can
listen
,
and
answer
*NL*
it
inwardly
.
Ah
,
good
conversation
--
there
's
nothing
like
it
,
is
there
?
*NL*
The
air
of
ideas
is
the
only
air
worth
breathing
.
And
so
I
have
never
*NL*
regretted
giving
up
either
diplomacy
or
journalism
--
two
different
forms
*NL*
of
the
same
self-abdication
.
''
He
fixed
his
vivid
eyes
on
Archer
as
he
*NL*
lit
another
cigarette
.
``
Voyez-vous
,
Monsieur
,
to
be
able
to
look
life
*NL*
in
the
face
:
that
's
worth
living
in
a
garret
for
,
is
n't
it
?
But
,
after
*NL*
all
,
one
must
earn
enough
to
pay
for
the
garret
;
and
I
confess
that
to
*NL*
grow
old
as
a
private
tutor
--
or
a
`
private
'
anything
--
is
almost
as
*NL*
chilling
to
the
imagination
as
a
second
secretaryship
at
Bucharest
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
feel
I
must
make
a
plunge
:
an
immense
plunge
.
Do
you
*NL*
suppose
,
for
instance
,
there
would
be
any
opening
for
me
in
America
--
in
*NL*
New
York
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
at
him
with
startled
eyes
.
New
York
,
for
a
young
man
who
*NL*
had
frequented
the
Goncourts
and
Flaubert
,
and
who
thought
the
life
of
*NL*
ideas
the
only
one
worth
living
!
He
continued
to
stare
at
M.
Riviere
*NL*
perplexedly
,
wondering
how
to
tell
him
that
his
very
superiorities
and
*NL*
advantages
would
be
the
surest
hindrance
to
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
New
York
--
New
York
--
but
must
it
be
especially
New
York
?
''
he
stammered
,
*NL*
utterly
unable
to
imagine
what
lucrative
opening
his
native
city
could
*NL*
offer
to
a
young
man
to
whom
good
conversation
appeared
to
be
the
only
*NL*
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
flush
rose
under
M.
Riviere
's
sallow
skin
.
``
I
--
I
thought
it
*NL*
your
metropolis
:
is
not
the
intellectual
life
more
active
there
?
''
he
*NL*
rejoined
;
then
,
as
if
fearing
to
give
his
hearer
the
impression
of
*NL*
having
asked
a
favour
,
he
went
on
hastily
:
``
One
throws
out
random
*NL*
suggestions
--
more
to
one
's
self
than
to
others
.
In
reality
,
I
see
no
*NL*
immediate
prospect
--
''
and
rising
from
his
seat
he
added
,
without
a
*NL*
trace
of
constraint
:
``
But
Mrs.
Carfry
will
think
that
I
ought
to
be
*NL*
taking
you
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
homeward
drive
Archer
pondered
deeply
on
this
episode
.
His
*NL*
hour
with
M.
Riviere
had
put
new
air
into
his
lungs
,
and
his
first
*NL*
impulse
had
been
to
invite
him
to
dine
the
next
day
;
but
he
was
*NL*
beginning
to
understand
why
married
men
did
not
always
immediately
*NL*
yield
to
their
first
impulses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
young
tutor
is
an
interesting
fellow
:
we
had
some
awfully
good
*NL*
talk
after
dinner
about
books
and
things
,
''
he
threw
out
tentatively
in
*NL*
the
hansom
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
roused
herself
from
one
of
the
dreamy
silences
into
which
he
had
*NL*
read
so
many
meanings
before
six
months
of
marriage
had
given
him
the
*NL*
key
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
Frenchman
?
Was
n't
he
dreadfully
common
?
''
she
questioned
*NL*
coldly
;
and
he
guessed
that
she
nursed
a
secret
disappointment
at
*NL*
having
been
invited
out
in
London
to
meet
a
clergyman
and
a
French
*NL*
tutor
.
The
disappointment
was
not
occasioned
by
the
sentiment
*NL*
ordinarily
defined
as
snobbishness
,
but
by
old
New
York
's
sense
of
what
*NL*
was
due
to
it
when
it
risked
its
dignity
in
foreign
lands
.
If
May
's
*NL*
parents
had
entertained
the
Carfrys
in
Fifth
Avenue
they
would
have
*NL*
offered
them
something
more
substantial
than
a
parson
and
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Archer
was
on
edge
,
and
took
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Common
--
common
WHERE
?
''
he
queried
;
and
she
returned
with
unusual
*NL*
readiness
:
``
Why
,
I
should
say
anywhere
but
in
his
school-room
.
Those
*NL*
people
are
always
awkward
in
society
.
But
then
,
''
she
added
*NL*
disarmingly
,
``
I
suppose
I
should
n't
have
known
if
he
was
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
disliked
her
use
of
the
word
``
clever
''
almost
as
much
as
her
use
*NL*
of
the
word
``
common
''
;
but
he
was
beginning
to
fear
his
tendency
to
*NL*
dwell
on
the
things
he
disliked
in
her
.
After
all
,
her
point
of
view
*NL*
had
always
been
the
same
.
It
was
that
of
all
the
people
he
had
grown
*NL*
up
among
,
and
he
had
always
regarded
it
as
necessary
but
negligible
.
*NL*
Until
a
few
months
ago
he
had
never
known
a
``
nice
''
woman
who
looked
at
*NL*
life
differently
;
and
if
a
man
married
it
must
necessarily
be
among
the
*NL*
nice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
then
I
wo
n't
ask
him
to
dine
!
''
he
concluded
with
a
laugh
;
and
May
*NL*
echoed
,
bewildered
:
``
Goodness
--
ask
the
Carfrys
'
tutor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
on
the
same
day
with
the
Carfrys
,
if
you
prefer
I
should
n't
.
*NL*
But
I
did
rather
want
another
talk
with
him
.
He
's
looking
for
a
job
in
*NL*
New
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
surprise
increased
with
her
indifference
:
he
almost
fancied
that
*NL*
she
suspected
him
of
being
tainted
with
``
foreignness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
job
in
New
York
?
What
sort
of
a
job
?
People
do
n't
have
French
*NL*
tutors
:
what
does
he
want
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chiefly
to
enjoy
good
conversation
,
I
understand
,
''
her
husband
*NL*
retorted
perversely
;
and
she
broke
into
an
appreciative
laugh
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Newland
,
how
funny
!
Is
n't
that
FRENCH
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
he
was
glad
to
have
the
matter
settled
for
him
by
her
*NL*
refusing
to
take
seriously
his
wish
to
invite
M.
Riviere
.
Another
*NL*
after-dinner
talk
would
have
made
it
difficult
to
avoid
the
question
of
*NL*
New
York
;
and
the
more
Archer
considered
it
the
less
he
was
able
to
fit
*NL*
M.
Riviere
into
any
conceivable
picture
of
New
York
as
he
knew
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
perceived
with
a
flash
of
chilling
insight
that
in
future
many
*NL*
problems
would
be
thus
negatively
solved
for
him
;
but
as
he
paid
the
*NL*
hansom
and
followed
his
wife
's
long
train
into
the
house
he
took
refuge
*NL*
in
the
comforting
platitude
that
the
first
six
months
were
always
the
*NL*
most
difficult
in
marriage
.
``
After
that
I
suppose
we
shall
have
pretty
*NL*
nearly
finished
rubbing
off
each
other
's
angles
,
''
he
reflected
;
but
the
*NL*
worst
of
it
was
that
May
's
pressure
was
already
bearing
on
the
very
*NL*
angles
whose
sharpness
he
most
wanted
to
keep
.

*NL*
*NL*

XXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
bright
lawn
stretched
away
smoothly
to
the
big
bright
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
turf
was
hemmed
with
an
edge
of
scarlet
geranium
and
coleus
,
and
*NL*
cast-iron
vases
painted
in
chocolate
colour
,
standing
at
intervals
*NL*
along
the
winding
path
that
led
to
the
sea
,
looped
their
garlands
of
*NL*
petunia
and
ivy
geranium
above
the
neatly
raked
gravel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
way
between
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
the
square
wooden
house
*NL*
-LRB-
which
was
also
chocolate-coloured
,
but
with
the
tin
roof
of
the
*NL*
verandah
striped
in
yellow
and
brown
to
represent
an
awning
-RRB-
two
large
*NL*
targets
had
been
placed
against
a
background
of
shrubbery
.
On
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
lawn
,
facing
the
targets
,
was
pitched
a
real
tent
,
*NL*
with
benches
and
garden-seats
about
it
.
A
number
of
ladies
in
summer
*NL*
dresses
and
gentlemen
in
grey
frock-coats
and
tall
hats
stood
on
the
*NL*
lawn
or
sat
upon
the
benches
;
and
every
now
and
then
a
slender
girl
in
*NL*
starched
muslin
would
step
from
the
tent
,
bow
in
hand
,
and
speed
her
*NL*
shaft
at
one
of
the
targets
,
while
the
spectators
interrupted
their
*NL*
talk
to
watch
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
standing
on
the
verandah
of
the
house
,
looked
curiously
*NL*
down
upon
this
scene
.
On
each
side
of
the
shiny
painted
steps
was
a
*NL*
large
blue
china
flower-pot
on
a
bright
yellow
china
stand
.
A
spiky
*NL*
green
plant
filled
each
pot
,
and
below
the
verandah
ran
a
wide
border
*NL*
of
blue
hydrangeas
edged
with
more
red
geraniums
.
Behind
him
,
the
*NL*
French
windows
of
the
drawing-rooms
through
which
he
had
passed
gave
*NL*
glimpses
,
between
swaying
lace
curtains
,
of
glassy
parquet
floors
*NL*
islanded
with
chintz
poufs
,
dwarf
armchairs
,
and
velvet
tables
covered
*NL*
with
trifles
in
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Newport
Archery
Club
always
held
its
August
meeting
at
the
*NL*
Beauforts
'
.
The
sport
,
which
had
hitherto
known
no
rival
but
croquet
,
*NL*
was
beginning
to
be
discarded
in
favour
of
lawn-tennis
;
but
the
latter
*NL*
game
was
still
considered
too
rough
and
inelegant
for
social
occasions
,
*NL*
and
as
an
opportunity
to
show
off
pretty
dresses
and
graceful
attitudes
*NL*
the
bow
and
arrow
held
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
down
with
wonder
at
the
familiar
spectacle
.
It
surprised
*NL*
him
that
life
should
be
going
on
in
the
old
way
when
his
own
reactions
*NL*
to
it
had
so
completely
changed
.
It
was
Newport
that
had
first
brought
*NL*
home
to
him
the
extent
of
the
change
.
In
New
York
,
during
the
previous
*NL*
winter
,
after
he
and
May
had
settled
down
in
the
new
greenish-yellow
*NL*
house
with
the
bow-window
and
the
Pompeian
vestibule
,
he
had
dropped
*NL*
back
with
relief
into
the
old
routine
of
the
office
,
and
the
renewal
of
*NL*
this
daily
activity
had
served
as
a
link
with
his
former
self
.
Then
*NL*
there
had
been
the
pleasurable
excitement
of
choosing
a
showy
grey
*NL*
stepper
for
May
's
brougham
-LRB-
the
Wellands
had
given
the
carriage
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
the
abiding
occupation
and
interest
of
arranging
his
new
library
,
*NL*
which
,
in
spite
of
family
doubts
and
disapprovals
,
had
been
carried
out
*NL*
as
he
had
dreamed
,
with
a
dark
embossed
paper
,
Eastlake
book-cases
and
*NL*
``
sincere
''
arm-chairs
and
tables
.
At
the
Century
he
had
found
Winsett
*NL*
again
,
and
at
the
Knickerbocker
the
fashionable
young
men
of
his
own
*NL*
set
;
and
what
with
the
hours
dedicated
to
the
law
and
those
given
to
*NL*
dining
out
or
entertaining
friends
at
home
,
with
an
occasional
evening
*NL*
at
the
Opera
or
the
play
,
the
life
he
was
living
had
still
seemed
a
*NL*
fairly
real
and
inevitable
sort
of
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Newport
represented
the
escape
from
duty
into
an
atmosphere
of
*NL*
unmitigated
holiday-making
.
Archer
had
tried
to
persuade
May
to
spend
*NL*
the
summer
on
a
remote
island
off
the
coast
of
Maine
-LRB-
called
,
*NL*
appropriately
enough
,
Mount
Desert
-RRB-
,
where
a
few
hardy
Bostonians
and
*NL*
Philadelphians
were
camping
in
``
native
''
cottages
,
and
whence
came
*NL*
reports
of
enchanting
scenery
and
a
wild
,
almost
trapper-like
existence
*NL*
amid
woods
and
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Wellands
always
went
to
Newport
,
where
they
owned
one
of
the
*NL*
square
boxes
on
the
cliffs
,
and
their
son-in-law
could
adduce
no
good
*NL*
reason
why
he
and
May
should
not
join
them
there
.
As
Mrs.
Welland
*NL*
rather
tartly
pointed
out
,
it
was
hardly
worth
while
for
May
to
have
*NL*
worn
herself
out
trying
on
summer
clothes
in
Paris
if
she
was
not
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
wear
them
;
and
this
argument
was
of
a
kind
to
which
Archer
*NL*
had
as
yet
found
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
herself
could
not
understand
his
obscure
reluctance
to
fall
in
with
*NL*
so
reasonable
and
pleasant
a
way
of
spending
the
summer
.
She
reminded
*NL*
him
that
he
had
always
liked
Newport
in
his
bachelor
days
,
and
as
this
*NL*
was
indisputable
he
could
only
profess
that
he
was
sure
he
was
going
to
*NL*
like
it
better
than
ever
now
that
they
were
to
be
there
together
.
But
*NL*
as
he
stood
on
the
Beaufort
verandah
and
looked
out
on
the
brightly
*NL*
peopled
lawn
it
came
home
to
him
with
a
shiver
that
he
was
not
going
to
*NL*
like
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
May
's
fault
,
poor
dear
.
If
,
now
and
then
,
during
their
*NL*
travels
,
they
had
fallen
slightly
out
of
step
,
harmony
had
been
*NL*
restored
by
their
return
to
the
conditions
she
was
used
to
.
He
had
*NL*
always
foreseen
that
she
would
not
disappoint
him
;
and
he
had
been
*NL*
right
.
He
had
married
-LRB-
as
most
young
men
did
-RRB-
because
he
had
met
a
*NL*
perfectly
charming
girl
at
the
moment
when
a
series
of
rather
aimless
*NL*
sentimental
adventures
were
ending
in
premature
disgust
;
and
she
had
*NL*
represented
peace
,
stability
,
comradeship
,
and
the
steadying
sense
of
*NL*
an
unescapable
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
say
that
he
had
been
mistaken
in
his
choice
,
for
she
had
*NL*
fulfilled
all
that
he
had
expected
.
It
was
undoubtedly
gratifying
to
*NL*
be
the
husband
of
one
of
the
handsomest
and
most
popular
young
married
*NL*
women
in
New
York
,
especially
when
she
was
also
one
of
the
*NL*
sweetest-tempered
and
most
reasonable
of
wives
;
and
Archer
had
never
*NL*
been
insensible
to
such
advantages
.
As
for
the
momentary
madness
which
*NL*
had
fallen
upon
him
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
,
he
had
trained
himself
*NL*
to
regard
it
as
the
last
of
his
discarded
experiments
.
The
idea
that
*NL*
he
could
ever
,
in
his
senses
,
have
dreamed
of
marrying
the
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
had
become
almost
unthinkable
,
and
she
remained
in
his
memory
*NL*
simply
as
the
most
plaintive
and
poignant
of
a
line
of
ghosts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
these
abstractions
and
eliminations
made
of
his
mind
a
rather
*NL*
empty
and
echoing
place
,
and
he
supposed
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
*NL*
why
the
busy
animated
people
on
the
Beaufort
lawn
shocked
him
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
children
playing
in
a
grave-yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
a
murmur
of
skirts
beside
him
,
and
the
Marchioness
Manson
*NL*
fluttered
out
of
the
drawing-room
window
.
As
usual
,
she
was
*NL*
extraordinarily
festooned
and
bedizened
,
with
a
limp
Leghorn
hat
*NL*
anchored
to
her
head
by
many
windings
of
faded
gauze
,
and
a
little
*NL*
black
velvet
parasol
on
a
carved
ivory
handle
absurdly
balanced
over
*NL*
her
much
larger
hatbrim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Newland
,
I
had
no
idea
that
you
and
May
had
arrived
!
You
*NL*
yourself
came
only
yesterday
,
you
say
?
Ah
,
*NL*
business
--
business
--
professional
duties
...
I
understand
.
Many
*NL*
husbands
,
I
know
,
find
it
impossible
to
join
their
wives
here
except
*NL*
for
the
week-end
.
''
She
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
and
languished
at
*NL*
him
through
screwed-up
eyes
.
``
But
marriage
is
one
long
sacrifice
,
as
I
*NL*
used
often
to
remind
my
Ellen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
heart
stopped
with
the
queer
jerk
which
it
had
given
once
*NL*
before
,
and
which
seemed
suddenly
to
slam
a
door
between
himself
and
*NL*
the
outer
world
;
but
this
break
of
continuity
must
have
been
of
the
*NL*
briefest
,
for
he
presently
heard
Medora
answering
a
question
he
had
*NL*
apparently
found
voice
to
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
staying
here
,
but
with
the
Blenkers
,
in
their
delicious
*NL*
solitude
at
Portsmouth
.
Beaufort
was
kind
enough
to
send
his
famous
*NL*
trotters
for
me
this
morning
,
so
that
I
might
have
at
least
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
one
of
Regina
's
garden-parties
;
but
this
evening
I
go
back
to
rural
*NL*
life
.
The
Blenkers
,
dear
original
beings
,
have
hired
a
primitive
old
*NL*
farm-house
at
Portsmouth
where
they
gather
about

representative
*NL*
people

''
She
drooped
slightly
beneath
her
protecting
brim
,
and
*NL*
added
with
a
faint
blush
:
``
This
week
Dr.
Agathon
Carver
is
holding
a
*NL*
series
of
Inner
Thought
meetings
there
.
A
contrast
indeed
to
this
gay
*NL*
scene
of
worldly
pleasure
--
but
then
I
have
always
lived
on
contrasts
!
*NL*
To
me
the
only
death
is
monotony
.
I
always
say
to
Ellen
:
Beware
of
*NL*
monotony
;
it
's
the
mother
of
all
the
deadly
sins
.
But
my
poor
child
is
*NL*
going
through
a
phase
of
exaltation
,
of
abhorrence
of
the
world
.
You
*NL*
know
,
I
suppose
,
that
she
has
declined
all
invitations
to
stay
at
*NL*
Newport
,
even
with
her
grandmother
Mingott
?
I
could
hardly
persuade
*NL*
her
to
come
with
me
to
the
Blenkers
'
,
if
you
will
believe
it
!
The
life
*NL*
she
leads
is
morbid
,
unnatural
.
Ah
,
if
she
had
only
listened
to
me
*NL*
when
it
was
still
possible
...
When
the
door
was
still
open
...
But
*NL*
shall
we
go
down
and
watch
this
absorbing
match
?
I
hear
your
May
is
*NL*
one
of
the
competitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strolling
toward
them
from
the
tent
Beaufort
advanced
over
the
lawn
,
*NL*
tall
,
heavy
,
too
tightly
buttoned
into
a
London
frock-coat
,
with
one
of
*NL*
his
own
orchids
in
its
buttonhole
.
Archer
,
who
had
not
seen
him
for
*NL*
two
or
three
months
,
was
struck
by
the
change
in
his
appearance
.
In
*NL*
the
hot
summer
light
his
floridness
seemed
heavy
and
bloated
,
and
but
*NL*
for
his
erect
square-shouldered
walk
he
would
have
looked
like
an
*NL*
over-fed
and
over-dressed
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
all
sorts
of
rumours
afloat
about
Beaufort
.
In
the
spring
*NL*
he
had
gone
off
on
a
long
cruise
to
the
West
Indies
in
his
new
*NL*
steam-yacht
,
and
it
was
reported
that
,
at
various
points
where
he
had
*NL*
touched
,
a
lady
resembling
Miss
Fanny
Ring
had
been
seen
in
his
*NL*
company
.
The
steam-yacht
,
built
in
the
Clyde
,
and
fitted
with
tiled
*NL*
bath-rooms
and
other
unheard-of
luxuries
,
was
said
to
have
cost
him
*NL*
half
a
million
;
and
the
pearl
necklace
which
he
had
presented
to
his
*NL*
wife
on
his
return
was
as
magnificent
as
such
expiatory
offerings
are
*NL*
apt
to
be
.
Beaufort
's
fortune
was
substantial
enough
to
stand
the
*NL*
strain
;
and
yet
the
disquieting
rumours
persisted
,
not
only
in
Fifth
*NL*
Avenue
but
in
Wall
Street
.
Some
people
said
he
had
speculated
*NL*
unfortunately
in
railways
,
others
that
he
was
being
bled
by
one
of
the
*NL*
most
insatiable
members
of
her
profession
;
and
to
every
report
of
*NL*
threatened
insolvency
Beaufort
replied
by
a
fresh
extravagance
:
the
*NL*
building
of
a
new
row
of
orchid-houses
,
the
purchase
of
a
new
string
of
*NL*
race-horses
,
or
the
addition
of
a
new
Meissonnier
or
Cabanel
to
his
*NL*
picture-gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
toward
the
Marchioness
and
Newland
with
his
usual
*NL*
half-sneering
smile
.
``
Hullo
,
Medora
!
Did
the
trotters
do
their
*NL*
business
?
Forty
minutes
,
eh
?
...
Well
,
that
's
not
so
bad
,
*NL*
considering
your
nerves
had
to
be
spared
.
''
He
shook
hands
with
Archer
,
*NL*
and
then
,
turning
back
with
them
,
placed
himself
on
Mrs.
Manson
's
other
*NL*
side
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
a
few
words
which
their
companion
did
*NL*
not
catch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marchioness
replied
by
one
of
her
queer
foreign
jerks
,
and
a
``
Que
*NL*
voulez-vous
?
''
which
deepened
Beaufort
's
frown
;
but
he
produced
a
good
*NL*
semblance
of
a
congratulatory
smile
as
he
glanced
at
Archer
to
say
:
*NL*
``
You
know
May
's
going
to
carry
off
the
first
prize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then
it
remains
in
the
family
,
''
Medora
rippled
;
and
at
that
moment
*NL*
they
reached
the
tent
and
Mrs.
Beaufort
met
them
in
a
girlish
cloud
of
*NL*
mauve
muslin
and
floating
veils
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
Welland
was
just
coming
out
of
the
tent
.
In
her
white
dress
,
with
*NL*
a
pale
green
ribbon
about
the
waist
and
a
wreath
of
ivy
on
her
hat
,
she
*NL*
had
the
same
Diana-like
aloofness
as
when
she
had
entered
the
Beaufort
*NL*
ball-room
on
the
night
of
her
engagement
.
In
the
interval
not
a
*NL*
thought
seemed
to
have
passed
behind
her
eyes
or
a
feeling
through
her
*NL*
heart
;
and
though
her
husband
knew
that
she
had
the
capacity
for
both
*NL*
he
marvelled
afresh
at
the
way
in
which
experience
dropped
away
from
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
bow
and
arrow
in
her
hand
,
and
placing
herself
on
the
*NL*
chalk-mark
traced
on
the
turf
she
lifted
the
bow
to
her
shoulder
and
*NL*
took
aim
.
The
attitude
was
so
full
of
a
classic
grace
that
a
murmur
of
*NL*
appreciation
followed
her
appearance
,
and
Archer
felt
the
glow
of
*NL*
proprietorship
that
so
often
cheated
him
into
momentary
well-being
.
*NL*
Her
rivals
--
Mrs.
Reggie
Chivers
,
the
Merry
girls
,
and
divers
rosy
*NL*
Thorleys
,
Dagonets
and
Mingotts
,
stood
behind
her
in
a
lovely
anxious
*NL*
group
,
brown
heads
and
golden
bent
above
the
scores
,
and
pale
muslins
*NL*
and
flower-wreathed
hats
mingled
in
a
tender
rainbow
.
All
were
young
*NL*
and
pretty
,
and
bathed
in
summer
bloom
;
but
not
one
had
the
nymph-like
*NL*
ease
of
his
wife
,
when
,
with
tense
muscles
and
happy
frown
,
she
bent
*NL*
her
soul
upon
some
feat
of
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gad
,
''
Archer
heard
Lawrence
Lefferts
say
,
``
not
one
of
the
lot
holds
*NL*
the
bow
as
she
does
''
;
and
Beaufort
retorted
:
``
Yes
;
but
that
's
the
only
*NL*
kind
of
target
she
'll
ever
hit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
irrationally
angry
.
His
host
's
contemptuous
tribute
to
*NL*
May
's
``
niceness
''
was
just
what
a
husband
should
have
wished
to
hear
*NL*
said
of
his
wife
.
The
fact
that
a
coarseminded
man
found
her
lacking
*NL*
in
attraction
was
simply
another
proof
of
her
quality
;
yet
the
words
*NL*
sent
a
faint
shiver
through
his
heart
.
What
if
``
niceness
''
carried
to
*NL*
that
supreme
degree
were
only
a
negation
,
the
curtain
dropped
before
an
*NL*
emptiness
?
As
he
looked
at
May
,
returning
flushed
and
calm
from
her
*NL*
final
bull
's
-
eye
,
he
had
the
feeling
that
he
had
never
yet
lifted
that
*NL*
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
congratulations
of
her
rivals
and
of
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
company
with
the
simplicity
that
was
her
crowning
grace
.
No
one
could
*NL*
ever
be
jealous
of
her
triumphs
because
she
managed
to
give
the
feeling
*NL*
that
she
would
have
been
just
as
serene
if
she
had
missed
them
.
But
*NL*
when
her
eyes
met
her
husband
's
her
face
glowed
with
the
pleasure
she
*NL*
saw
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
's
basket-work
pony-carriage
was
waiting
for
them
,
and
they
*NL*
drove
off
among
the
dispersing
carriages
,
May
handling
the
reins
and
*NL*
Archer
sitting
at
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
sunlight
still
lingered
upon
the
bright
lawns
and
*NL*
shrubberies
,
and
up
and
down
Bellevue
Avenue
rolled
a
double
line
of
*NL*
victorias
,
dog-carts
,
landaus
and
``
vis-a-vis
,
''
carrying
well-dressed
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
away
from
the
Beaufort
garden-party
,
or
homeward
*NL*
from
their
daily
afternoon
turn
along
the
Ocean
Drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
to
see
Granny
?
''
May
suddenly
proposed
.
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
tell
her
myself
that
I
've
won
the
prize
.
There
's
lots
of
time
before
*NL*
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
acquiesced
,
and
she
turned
the
ponies
down
Narragansett
Avenue
,
*NL*
crossed
Spring
Street
and
drove
out
toward
the
rocky
moorland
beyond
.
*NL*
In
this
unfashionable
region
Catherine
the
Great
,
always
indifferent
to
*NL*
precedent
and
thrifty
of
purse
,
had
built
herself
in
her
youth
a
*NL*
many-peaked
and
cross-beamed
cottage-orne
on
a
bit
of
cheap
land
*NL*
overlooking
the
bay
.
Here
,
in
a
thicket
of
stunted
oaks
,
her
verandahs
*NL*
spread
themselves
above
the
island-dotted
waters
.
A
winding
drive
led
*NL*
up
between
iron
stags
and
blue
glass
balls
embedded
in
mounds
of
*NL*
geraniums
to
a
front
door
of
highly-varnished
walnut
under
a
striped
*NL*
verandah-roof
;
and
behind
it
ran
a
narrow
hall
with
a
black
and
yellow
*NL*
star-patterned
parquet
floor
,
upon
which
opened
four
small
square
rooms
*NL*
with
heavy
flock-papers
under
ceilings
on
which
an
Italian
*NL*
house-painter
had
lavished
all
the
divinities
of
Olympus
.
One
of
these
*NL*
rooms
had
been
turned
into
a
bedroom
by
Mrs.
Mingott
when
the
burden
of
*NL*
flesh
descended
on
her
,
and
in
the
adjoining
one
she
spent
her
days
,
*NL*
enthroned
in
a
large
armchair
between
the
open
door
and
window
,
and
*NL*
perpetually
waving
a
palm-leaf
fan
which
the
prodigious
projection
of
*NL*
her
bosom
kept
so
far
from
the
rest
of
her
person
that
the
air
it
set
*NL*
in
motion
stirred
only
the
fringe
of
the
anti-macassars
on
the
*NL*
chair-arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
she
had
been
the
means
of
hastening
his
marriage
old
Catherine
*NL*
had
shown
to
Archer
the
cordiality
which
a
service
rendered
excites
*NL*
toward
the
person
served
.
She
was
persuaded
that
irrepressible
passion
*NL*
was
the
cause
of
his
impatience
;
and
being
an
ardent
admirer
of
*NL*
impulsiveness
-LRB-
when
it
did
not
lead
to
the
spending
of
money
-RRB-
she
*NL*
always
received
him
with
a
genial
twinkle
of
complicity
and
a
play
of
*NL*
allusion
to
which
May
seemed
fortunately
impervious
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
examined
and
appraised
with
much
interest
the
diamond-tipped
arrow
*NL*
which
had
been
pinned
on
May
's
bosom
at
the
conclusion
of
the
match
,
*NL*
remarking
that
in
her
day
a
filigree
brooch
would
have
been
thought
*NL*
enough
,
but
that
there
was
no
denying
that
Beaufort
did
things
*NL*
handsomely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
an
heirloom
,
in
fact
,
my
dear
,
''
the
old
lady
chuckled
.
``
You
*NL*
must
leave
it
in
fee
to
your
eldest
girl
.
''
She
pinched
May
's
white
arm
*NL*
and
watched
the
colour
flood
her
face
.
``
Well
,
well
,
what
have
I
said
*NL*
to
make
you
shake
out
the
red
flag
?
Ai
n't
there
going
to
be
any
*NL*
daughters
--
only
boys
,
eh
?
Good
gracious
,
look
at
her
blushing
again
*NL*
all
over
her
blushes
!
What
--
ca
n't
I
say
that
either
?
Mercy
me
--
when
*NL*
my
children
beg
me
to
have
all
those
gods
and
goddesses
painted
out
*NL*
overhead
I
always
say
I
'm
too
thankful
to
have
somebody
about
me
that
*NL*
NOTHING
can
shock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
May
echoed
it
,
crimson
to
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
tell
me
all
about
the
party
,
please
,
my
dears
,
for
I
shall
*NL*
never
get
a
straight
word
about
it
out
of
that
silly
Medora
,
''
the
*NL*
ancestress
continued
;
and
,
as
May
exclaimed
:
``
Cousin
Medora
?
But
I
*NL*
thought
she
was
going
back
to
Portsmouth
?
''
she
answered
placidly
:
``
So
*NL*
she
is
--
but
she
's
got
to
come
here
first
to
pick
up
Ellen
.
Ah
--
you
*NL*
did
n't
know
Ellen
had
come
to
spend
the
day
with
me
?
Such
fol-de-rol
,
*NL*
her
not
coming
for
the
summer
;
but
I
gave
up
arguing
with
young
people
*NL*
about
fifty
years
ago
.
Ellen
--
ELLEN
!
''
she
cried
in
her
shrill
old
*NL*
voice
,
trying
to
bend
forward
far
enough
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lawn
*NL*
beyond
the
verandah
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
,
and
Mrs.
Mingott
rapped
impatiently
with
her
stick
*NL*
on
the
shiny
floor
.
A
mulatto
maid-servant
in
a
bright
turban
,
*NL*
replying
to
the
summons
,
informed
her
mistress
that
she
had
seen
``
Miss
*NL*
Ellen
''
going
down
the
path
to
the
shore
;
and
Mrs.
Mingott
turned
to
*NL*
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
down
and
fetch
her
,
like
a
good
grandson
;
this
pretty
lady
will
*NL*
describe
the
party
to
me
,
''
she
said
;
and
Archer
stood
up
as
if
in
a
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
the
Countess
Olenska
's
name
pronounced
often
enough
during
*NL*
the
year
and
a
half
since
they
had
last
met
,
and
was
even
familiar
with
*NL*
the
main
incidents
of
her
life
in
the
interval
.
He
knew
that
she
had
*NL*
spent
the
previous
summer
at
Newport
,
where
she
appeared
to
have
gone
a
*NL*
great
deal
into
society
,
but
that
in
the
autumn
she
had
suddenly
*NL*
sub-let
the
``
perfect
house
''
which
Beaufort
had
been
at
such
pains
to
*NL*
find
for
her
,
and
decided
to
establish
herself
in
Washington
.
There
,
*NL*
during
the
winter
,
he
had
heard
of
her
-LRB-
as
one
always
heard
of
pretty
*NL*
women
in
Washington
-RRB-
as
shining
in
the
``
brilliant
diplomatic
society
''
*NL*
that
was
supposed
to
make
up
for
the
social
short-comings
of
the
*NL*
Administration
.
He
had
listened
to
these
accounts
,
and
to
various
*NL*
contradictory
reports
on
her
appearance
,
her
conversation
,
her
point
of
*NL*
view
and
her
choice
of
friends
,
with
the
detachment
with
which
one
*NL*
listens
to
reminiscences
of
some
one
long
since
dead
;
not
till
Medora
*NL*
suddenly
spoke
her
name
at
the
archery
match
had
Ellen
Olenska
become
a
*NL*
living
presence
to
him
again
.
The
Marchioness
's
foolish
lisp
had
*NL*
called
up
a
vision
of
the
little
fire-lit
drawing-room
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
carriage-wheels
returning
down
the
deserted
street
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
a
story
he
had
read
,
of
some
peasant
children
in
Tuscany
lighting
a
*NL*
bunch
of
straw
in
a
wayside
cavern
,
and
revealing
old
silent
images
in
*NL*
their
painted
tomb
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
to
the
shore
descended
from
the
bank
on
which
the
house
was
*NL*
perched
to
a
walk
above
the
water
planted
with
weeping
willows
.
*NL*
Through
their
veil
Archer
caught
the
glint
of
the
Lime
Rock
,
with
its
*NL*
white-washed
turret
and
the
tiny
house
in
which
the
heroic
light-house
*NL*
keeper
,
Ida
Lewis
,
was
living
her
last
venerable
years
.
Beyond
it
lay
*NL*
the
flat
reaches
and
ugly
government
chimneys
of
Goat
Island
,
the
bay
*NL*
spreading
northward
in
a
shimmer
of
gold
to
Prudence
Island
with
its
*NL*
low
growth
of
oaks
,
and
the
shores
of
Conanicut
faint
in
the
sunset
*NL*
haze
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
willow
walk
projected
a
slight
wooden
pier
ending
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
pagoda-like
summer-house
;
and
in
the
pagoda
a
lady
stood
,
leaning
*NL*
against
the
rail
,
her
back
to
the
shore
.
Archer
stopped
at
the
sight
*NL*
as
if
he
had
waked
from
sleep
.
That
vision
of
the
past
was
a
dream
,
*NL*
and
the
reality
was
what
awaited
him
in
the
house
on
the
bank
overhead
:
*NL*
was
Mrs.
Welland
's
pony-carriage
circling
around
and
around
the
oval
at
*NL*
the
door
,
was
May
sitting
under
the
shameless
Olympians
and
glowing
*NL*
with
secret
hopes
,
was
the
Welland
villa
at
the
far
end
of
Bellevue
*NL*
Avenue
,
and
Mr.
Welland
,
already
dressed
for
dinner
,
and
pacing
the
*NL*
drawing-room
floor
,
watch
in
hand
,
with
dyspeptic
impatience
--
for
it
*NL*
was
one
of
the
houses
in
which
one
always
knew
exactly
what
is
*NL*
happening
at
a
given
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
?
A
son-in-law
--
''
Archer
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
at
the
end
of
the
pier
had
not
moved
.
For
a
long
moment
the
*NL*
young
man
stood
half
way
down
the
bank
,
gazing
at
the
bay
furrowed
with
*NL*
the
coming
and
going
of
sailboats
,
yacht-launches
,
fishing-craft
and
*NL*
the
trailing
black
coal-barges
hauled
by
noisy
tugs
.
The
lady
in
the
*NL*
summer-house
seemed
to
be
held
by
the
same
sight
.
Beyond
the
grey
*NL*
bastions
of
Fort
Adams
a
long-drawn
sunset
was
splintering
up
into
a
*NL*
thousand
fires
,
and
the
radiance
caught
the
sail
of
a
catboat
as
it
*NL*
beat
out
through
the
channel
between
the
Lime
Rock
and
the
shore
.
*NL*
Archer
,
as
he
watched
,
remembered
the
scene
in
the
Shaughraun
,
and
*NL*
Montague
lifting
Ada
Dyas
's
ribbon
to
his
lips
without
her
knowing
that
*NL*
he
was
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
know
--
she
has
n't
guessed
.
Should
n't
I
know
if
she
came
up
*NL*
behind
me
,
I
wonder
?
''
he
mused
;
and
suddenly
he
said
to
himself
:
``
If
*NL*
she
does
n't
turn
before
that
sail
crosses
the
Lime
Rock
light
I
'll
go
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boat
was
gliding
out
on
the
receding
tide
.
It
slid
before
the
Lime
*NL*
Rock
,
blotted
out
Ida
Lewis
's
little
house
,
and
passed
across
the
*NL*
turret
in
which
the
light
was
hung
.
Archer
waited
till
a
wide
space
of
*NL*
water
sparkled
between
the
last
reef
of
the
island
and
the
stern
of
the
*NL*
boat
;
but
still
the
figure
in
the
summer-house
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
walked
up
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
you
did
n't
find
Ellen
--
I
should
have
liked
to
see
her
*NL*
again
,
''
May
said
as
they
drove
home
through
the
dusk
.
``
But
perhaps
she
*NL*
would
n't
have
cared
--
she
seems
so
changed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Changed
?
''
echoed
her
husband
in
a
colourless
voice
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
the
ponies
'
twitching
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
indifferent
to
her
friends
,
I
mean
;
giving
up
New
York
and
her
*NL*
house
,
and
spending
her
time
with
such
queer
people
.
Fancy
how
*NL*
hideously
uncomfortable
she
must
be
at
the
Blenkers
'
!
She
says
she
*NL*
does
it
to
keep
cousin
Medora
out
of
mischief
:
to
prevent
her
marrying
*NL*
dreadful
people
.
But
I
sometimes
think
we
've
always
bored
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
made
no
answer
,
and
she
continued
,
with
a
tinge
of
hardness
that
*NL*
he
had
never
before
noticed
in
her
frank
fresh
voice
:
``
After
all
,
I
*NL*
wonder
if
she
would
n't
be
happier
with
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
burst
into
a
laugh
.
``
Sancta
simplicitas
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
and
as
she
*NL*
turned
a
puzzled
frown
on
him
he
added
:
``
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
heard
*NL*
you
say
a
cruel
thing
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
watching
the
contortions
of
the
damned
is
supposed
to
be
a
*NL*
favourite
sport
of
the
angels
;
but
I
believe
even
they
do
n't
think
*NL*
people
happier
in
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
she
ever
married
abroad
then
,
''
said
May
,
in
the
placid
*NL*
tone
with
which
her
mother
met
Mr.
Welland
's
vagaries
;
and
Archer
felt
*NL*
himself
gently
relegated
to
the
category
of
unreasonable
husbands
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
down
Bellevue
Avenue
and
turned
in
between
the
chamfered
*NL*
wooden
gate-posts
surmounted
by
cast-iron
lamps
which
marked
the
*NL*
approach
to
the
Welland
villa
.
Lights
were
already
shining
through
its
*NL*
windows
,
and
Archer
,
as
the
carriage
stopped
,
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
*NL*
father-in-law
,
exactly
as
he
had
pictured
him
,
pacing
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
watch
in
hand
and
wearing
the
pained
expression
that
he
had
long
since
*NL*
found
to
be
much
more
efficacious
than
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
as
he
followed
his
wife
into
the
hall
,
was
conscious
of
*NL*
a
curious
reversal
of
mood
.
There
was
something
about
the
luxury
of
*NL*
the
Welland
house
and
the
density
of
the
Welland
atmosphere
,
so
charged
*NL*
with
minute
observances
and
exactions
,
that
always
stole
into
his
*NL*
system
like
a
narcotic
.
The
heavy
carpets
,
the
watchful
servants
,
the
*NL*
perpetually
reminding
tick
of
disciplined
clocks
,
the
perpetually
*NL*
renewed
stack
of
cards
and
invitations
on
the
hall
table
,
the
whole
*NL*
chain
of
tyrannical
trifles
binding
one
hour
to
the
next
,
and
each
*NL*
member
of
the
household
to
all
the
others
,
made
any
less
systematised
*NL*
and
affluent
existence
seem
unreal
and
precarious
.
But
now
it
was
the
*NL*
Welland
house
,
and
the
life
he
was
expected
to
lead
in
it
,
that
had
*NL*
become
unreal
and
irrelevant
,
and
the
brief
scene
on
the
shore
,
when
he
*NL*
had
stood
irresolute
,
halfway
down
the
bank
,
was
as
close
to
him
as
the
*NL*
blood
in
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
night
he
lay
awake
in
the
big
chintz
bedroom
at
May
's
side
,
*NL*
watching
the
moonlight
slant
along
the
carpet
,
and
thinking
of
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
driving
home
across
the
gleaming
beaches
behind
Beaufort
's
*NL*
trotters
.

``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Welland
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
looked
anxiously
and
*NL*
incredulously
across
the
luncheon-table
at
his
wife
,
who
,
adjusting
her
*NL*
gold
eye-glasses
,
read
aloud
,
in
the
tone
of
high
comedy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Good

''
Mr.

gasped
,
as
if
a
second
reading
had
been
*NL*
necessary
to
bring
the
monstrous
absurdity
of
the
thing
home
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Amy
Sillerton
--
you
never
can
tell
what
her
husband
will
do
next
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
sighed
.
``
I
suppose
he
's
just
discovered
the
Blenkers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Professor
Emerson
Sillerton
was
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
Newport
society
;
*NL*
and
a
thorn
that
could
not
be
plucked
out
,
for
it
grew
on
a
venerable
*NL*
and
venerated
family
tree
.
He
was
,
as
people
said
,
a
man
who
had
had
*NL*
``
every
advantage
.
''
His
father
was
Sillerton
Jackson
's
uncle
,
his
*NL*
mother
a
Pennilow
of
Boston
;
on
each
side
there
was
wealth
and
*NL*
position
,
and
mutual
suitability
.
Nothing
--
as
Mrs.
Welland
had
often
*NL*
remarked
--
nothing
on
earth
obliged
Emerson
Sillerton
to
be
an
*NL*
archaeologist
,
or
indeed
a
Professor
of
any
sort
,
or
to
live
in
Newport
*NL*
in
winter
,
or
do
any
of
the
other
revolutionary
things
that
he
did
.
*NL*
But
at
least
,
if
he
was
going
to
break
with
tradition
and
flout
society
*NL*
in
the
face
,
he
need
not
have
married
poor
Amy
Dagonet
,
who
had
a
right
*NL*
to
expect
``
something
different
,
''
and
money
enough
to
keep
her
own
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
in
the
Mingott
set
could
understand
why
Amy
Sillerton
had
*NL*
submitted
so
tamely
to
the
eccentricities
of
a
husband
who
filled
the
*NL*
house
with
long-haired
men
and
short-haired
women
,
and
,
when
he
*NL*
travelled
,
took
her
to
explore
tombs
in
Yucatan
instead
of
going
to
*NL*
Paris
or
Italy
.
But
there
they
were
,
set
in
their
ways
,
and
apparently
*NL*
unaware
that
they
were
different
from
other
people
;
and
when
they
gave
*NL*
one
of
their
dreary
annual
garden-parties
every
family
on
the
Cliffs
,
*NL*
because
of
the
Sillerton-Pennilow-Dagonet
connection
,
had
to
draw
lots
*NL*
and
send
an
unwilling
representative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wonder
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
remarked
,
``
that
they
did
n't
choose
the
*NL*
Cup
Race
day

Do
you
remember
,
two
years
ago
,
their
giving
a
party
for
*NL*
a
black
man
on
the
day
of
Julia
Mingott
's
the
dansant
?
Luckily
this
*NL*
time
there
's
nothing
else
going
on
that
I
know
of
--
for
of
course
some
*NL*
of
us
will
have
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Welland
sighed
nervously
.
''
`
Some
of
us
,

my
dear
--
more
than
one
?
*NL*
Three
o'clock
is
such
a
very
awkward
hour
.
I
have
to
be
here
at
*NL*
half-past
three
to
take
my
drops
:
it
's
really
no
use
trying
to
follow
*NL*
Bencomb
's
new
treatment
if
I
do
n't
do
it
systematically
;
and
if
I
join
*NL*
you
later
,
of
course
I
shall
miss
my
drive
.
''
At
the
thought
he
laid
*NL*
down
his
knife
and
fork
again
,
and
a
flush
of
anxiety
rose
to
his
*NL*
finely-wrinkled
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
reason
why
you
should
go
at
all
,
my
dear
,
''
his
wife
*NL*
answered
with
a
cheerfulness
that
had
become
automatic
.
``
I
have
some
*NL*
cards
to
leave
at
the
other
end
of
Bellevue
Avenue
,
and
I
'll
drop
in
at
*NL*
about
half-past
three
and
stay
long
enough
to
make
poor
Amy
feel
that
*NL*
she
has
n't
been
slighted
.
''
She
glanced
hesitatingly
at
her
daughter
.
*NL*
``
And
if
Newland
's
afternoon
is
provided
for
perhaps
May
can
drive
you
*NL*
out
with
the
ponies
,
and
try
their
new
russet
harness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
principle
in
the
Welland
family
that
people
's
days
and
hours
*NL*
should
be
what
Mrs.
Welland
called
``
provided
for
.
''
The
melancholy
*NL*
possibility
of
having
to
``
kill
time
''
-LRB-
especially
for
those
who
did
not
*NL*
care
for
whist
or
solitaire
-RRB-
was
a
vision
that
haunted
her
as
the
*NL*
spectre
of
the
unemployed
haunts
the
philanthropist
.
Another
of
her
*NL*
principles
was
that
parents
should
never
-LRB-
at
least
visibly
-RRB-
interfere
*NL*
with
the
plans
of
their
married
children
;
and
the
difficulty
of
*NL*
adjusting
this
respect
for
May
's
independence
with
the
exigency
of
Mr.
*NL*
Welland
's
claims
could
be
overcome
only
by
the
exercise
of
an
ingenuity
*NL*
which
left
not
a
second
of
Mrs.
Welland
's
own
time
unprovided
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'll
drive
with
Papa
--
I
'm
sure
Newland
will
find
something
*NL*
to
do
,
''
May
said
,
in
a
tone
that
gently
reminded
her
husband
of
his
*NL*
lack
of
response
.
It
was
a
cause
of
constant
distress
to
Mrs.
Welland
*NL*
that
her
son-in-law
showed
so
little
foresight
in
planning
his
days
.
*NL*
Often
already
,
during
the
fortnight
that
he
had
passed
under
her
roof
,
*NL*
when
she
enquired
how
he
meant
to
spend
his
afternoon
,
he
had
answered
*NL*
paradoxically
:
``
Oh
,
I
think
for
a
change
I
'll
just
save
it
instead
of
*NL*
spending
it
--
''
and
once
,
when
she
and
May
had
had
to
go
on
a
*NL*
long-postponed
round
of
afternoon
calls
,
he
had
confessed
to
having
*NL*
lain
all
the
afternoon
under
a
rock
on
the
beach
below
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
never
seems
to
look
ahead
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
once
ventured
to
*NL*
complain
to
her
daughter
;
and
May
answered
serenely
:
``
No
;
but
you
see
*NL*
it
does
n't
matter
,
because
when
there
's
nothing
particular
to
do
he
*NL*
reads
a
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
--
like
his
father
!
''
Mrs.
Welland
agreed
,
as
if
allowing
for
an
*NL*
inherited
oddity
;
and
after
that
the
question
of
Newland
's
unemployment
*NL*
was
tacitly
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
as
the
day
for
the
Sillerton
reception
approached
,
May
*NL*
began
to
show
a
natural
solicitude
for
his
welfare
,
and
to
suggest
a
*NL*
tennis
match
at
the
Chiverses
'
,
or
a
sail
on
Julius
Beaufort
's
cutter
,
*NL*
as
a
means
of
atoning
for
her
temporary
desertion
.
``
I
shall
be
back
by
*NL*
six
,
you
know
,
dear
:
Papa
never
drives
later
than
that
--
''
and
she
was
*NL*
not
reassured
till
Archer
said
that
he
thought
of
hiring
a
run-about
*NL*
and
driving
up
the
island
to
a
stud-farm
to
look
at
a
second
horse
for
*NL*
her
brougham
.
They
had
been
looking
for
this
horse
for
some
time
,
and
*NL*
the
suggestion
was
so
acceptable
that
May
glanced
at
her
mother
as
if
*NL*
to
say
:
``
You
see
he
knows
how
to
plan
out
his
time
as
well
as
any
of
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
the
stud-farm
and
the
brougham
horse
had
germinated
in
*NL*
Archer
's
mind
on
the
very
day
when
the
Emerson
Sillerton
invitation
had
*NL*
first
been
mentioned
;
but
he
had
kept
it
to
himself
as
if
there
were
*NL*
something
clandestine
in
the
plan
,
and
discovery
might
prevent
its
*NL*
execution
.
He
had
,
however
,
taken
the
precaution
to
engage
in
advance
*NL*
a
runabout
with
a
pair
of
old
livery-stable
trotters
that
could
still
*NL*
do
their
eighteen
miles
on
level
roads
;
and
at
two
o'clock
,
hastily
*NL*
deserting
the
luncheon-table
,
he
sprang
into
the
light
carriage
and
*NL*
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
perfect
.
A
breeze
from
the
north
drove
little
puffs
of
*NL*
white
cloud
across
an
ultramarine
sky
,
with
a
bright
sea
running
under
*NL*
it
.
Bellevue
Avenue
was
empty
at
that
hour
,
and
after
dropping
the
*NL*
stable-lad
at
the
corner
of
Mill
Street
Archer
turned
down
the
Old
*NL*
Beach
Road
and
drove
across
Eastman
's
Beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
feeling
of
unexplained
excitement
with
which
,
on
*NL*
half-holidays
at
school
,
he
used
to
start
off
into
the
unknown
.
Taking
*NL*
his
pair
at
an
easy
gait
,
he
counted
on
reaching
the
stud-farm
,
which
*NL*
was
not
far
beyond
Paradise
Rocks
,
before
three
o'clock
;
so
that
,
after
*NL*
looking
over
the
horse
-LRB-
and
trying
him
if
he
seemed
promising
-RRB-
he
would
*NL*
still
have
four
golden
hours
to
dispose
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
Sillerton
's
party
he
had
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
the
Marchioness
Manson
would
certainly
come
to
Newport
with
the
*NL*
Blenkers
,
and
that
Madame
Olenska
might
again
take
the
opportunity
of
*NL*
spending
the
day
with
her
grandmother
.
At
any
rate
,
the
Blenker
*NL*
habitation
would
probably
be
deserted
,
and
he
would
be
able
,
without
*NL*
indiscretion
,
to
satisfy
a
vague
curiosity
concerning
it
.
He
was
not
*NL*
sure
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
Countess
Olenska
again
;
but
ever
since
*NL*
he
had
looked
at
her
from
the
path
above
the
bay
he
had
wanted
,
*NL*
irrationally
and
indescribably
,
to
see
the
place
she
was
living
in
,
and
*NL*
to
follow
the
movements
of
her
imagined
figure
as
he
had
watched
the
*NL*
real
one
in
the
summer-house
.
The
longing
was
with
him
day
and
night
,
*NL*
an
incessant
undefinable
craving
,
like
the
sudden
whim
of
a
sick
man
*NL*
for
food
or
drink
once
tasted
and
long
since
forgotten
.
He
could
not
*NL*
see
beyond
the
craving
,
or
picture
what
it
might
lead
to
,
for
he
was
*NL*
not
conscious
of
any
wish
to
speak
to
Madame
Olenska
or
to
hear
her
*NL*
voice
.
He
simply
felt
that
if
he
could
carry
away
the
vision
of
the
*NL*
spot
of
earth
she
walked
on
,
and
the
way
the
sky
and
sea
enclosed
it
,
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
world
might
seem
less
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
stud-farm
a
glance
showed
him
that
the
horse
was
*NL*
not
what
he
wanted
;
nevertheless
he
took
a
turn
behind
it
in
order
to
*NL*
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
hurry
.
But
at
three
o'clock
he
*NL*
shook
out
the
reins
over
the
trotters
and
turned
into
the
by-roads
*NL*
leading
to
Portsmouth
.
The
wind
had
dropped
and
a
faint
haze
on
the
*NL*
horizon
showed
that
a
fog
was
waiting
to
steal
up
the
Saconnet
on
the
*NL*
turn
of
the
tide
;
but
all
about
him
fields
and
woods
were
steeped
in
*NL*
golden
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drove
past
grey-shingled
farm-houses
in
orchards
,
past
hay-fields
*NL*
and
groves
of
oak
,
past
villages
with
white
steeples
rising
sharply
*NL*
into
the
fading
sky
;
and
at
last
,
after
stopping
to
ask
the
way
of
some
*NL*
men
at
work
in
a
field
,
he
turned
down
a
lane
between
high
banks
of
*NL*
goldenrod
and
brambles
.
At
the
end
of
the
lane
was
the
blue
glimmer
of
*NL*
the
river
;
to
the
left
,
standing
in
front
of
a
clump
of
oaks
and
*NL*
maples
,
he
saw
a
long
tumble-down
house
with
white
paint
peeling
from
*NL*
its
clapboards
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
road-side
facing
the
gateway
stood
one
of
the
open
sheds
in
*NL*
which
the
New
Englander
shelters
his
farming
implements
and
visitors
*NL*
``
hitch
''
their
``
teams
.
''
Archer
,
jumping
down
,
led
his
pair
into
the
*NL*
shed
,
and
after
tying
them
to
a
post
turned
toward
the
house
.
The
*NL*
patch
of
lawn
before
it
had
relapsed
into
a
hay-field
;
but
to
the
left
*NL*
an
overgrown
box-garden
full
of
dahlias
and
rusty
rose-bushes
encircled
*NL*
a
ghostly
summer-house
of
trellis-work
that
had
once
been
white
,
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
wooden
Cupid
who
had
lost
his
bow
and
arrow
but
*NL*
continued
to
take
ineffectual
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
leaned
for
a
while
against
the
gate
.
No
one
was
in
sight
,
and
*NL*
not
a
sound
came
from
the
open
windows
of
the
house
:
a
grizzled
*NL*
Newfoundland
dozing
before
the
door
seemed
as
ineffectual
a
guardian
as
*NL*
the
arrowless
Cupid
.
It
was
strange
to
think
that
this
place
of
*NL*
silence
and
decay
was
the
home
of
the
turbulent
Blenkers
;
yet
Archer
*NL*
was
sure
that
he
was
not
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
he
stood
there
,
content
to
take
in
the
scene
,
and
*NL*
gradually
falling
under
its
drowsy
spell
;
but
at
length
he
roused
*NL*
himself
to
the
sense
of
the
passing
time
.
Should
he
look
his
fill
and
*NL*
then
drive
away
?
He
stood
irresolute
,
wishing
suddenly
to
see
the
*NL*
inside
of
the
house
,
so
that
he
might
picture
the
room
that
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
sat
in
.
There
was
nothing
to
prevent
his
walking
up
to
the
*NL*
door
and
ringing
the
bell
;
if
,
as
he
supposed
,
she
was
away
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
party
,
he
could
easily
give
his
name
,
and
ask
permission
to
*NL*
go
into
the
sitting-room
to
write
a
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
instead
,
he
crossed
the
lawn
and
turned
toward
the
box-garden
.
As
*NL*
he
entered
it
he
caught
sight
of
something
bright-coloured
in
the
*NL*
summer-house
,
and
presently
made
it
out
to
be
a
pink
parasol
.
The
*NL*
parasol
drew
him
like
a
magnet
:
he
was
sure
it
was
hers
.
He
went
into
*NL*
the
summer-house
,
and
sitting
down
on
the
rickety
seat
picked
up
the
*NL*
silken
thing
and
looked
at
its
carved
handle
,
which
was
made
of
some
*NL*
rare
wood
that
gave
out
an
aromatic
scent
.
Archer
lifted
the
handle
to
*NL*
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
a
rustle
of
skirts
against
the
box
,
and
sat
motionless
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
parasol
handle
with
clasped
hands
,
and
letting
the
*NL*
rustle
come
nearer
without
lifting
his
eyes
.
He
had
always
known
that
*NL*
this
must
happen
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Archer
!
''
exclaimed
a
loud
young
voice
;
and
looking
up
he
saw
*NL*
before
him
the
youngest
and
largest
of
the
Blenker
girls
,
blonde
and
*NL*
blowsy
,
in
bedraggled
muslin
.
A
red
blotch
on
one
of
her
cheeks
seemed
*NL*
to
show
that
it
had
recently
been
pressed
against
a
pillow
,
and
her
*NL*
half-awakened
eyes
stared
at
him
hospitably
but
confusedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
--
where
did
you
drop
from
?
I
must
have
been
sound
asleep
in
*NL*
the
hammock
.
Everybody
else
has
gone
to
Newport
.
Did
you
ring
?
''
she
*NL*
incoherently
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
confusion
was
greater
than
hers
.
``
I
--
no
--
that
is
,
I
was
just
*NL*
going
to
.
I
had
to
come
up
the
island
to
see
about
a
horse
,
and
I
*NL*
drove
over
on
a
chance
of
finding
Mrs.
Blenker
and
your
visitors
.
But
*NL*
the
house
seemed
empty
--
so
I
sat
down
to
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Blenker
,
shaking
off
the
fumes
of
sleep
,
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
increasing
interest
.
``
The
house
IS
empty
.
Mother
's
not
here
,
or
the
*NL*
Marchioness
--
or
anybody
but
me
.
''
Her
glance
became
faintly
*NL*
reproachful
.
``
Did
n't
you
know
that
Professor
and
Mrs.
Sillerton
are
*NL*
giving
a
garden-party
for
mother
and
all
of
us
this
afternoon
?
It
was
*NL*
too
unlucky
that
I
could
n't
go
;
but
I
've
had
a
sore
throat
,
and
mother
*NL*
was
afraid
of
the
drive
home
this
evening
.
Did
you
ever
know
anything
*NL*
so
disappointing
?
Of
course
,
''
she
added
gaily
,
``
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
minded
half
as
much
if
I
'd
known
you
were
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Symptoms
of
a
lumbering
coquetry
became
visible
in
her
,
and
Archer
*NL*
found
the
strength
to
break
in
:
``
But
Madame
Olenska
--
has
she
gone
to
*NL*
Newport
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Blenker
looked
at
him
with
surprise
.
``
Madame
Olenska
--
did
n't
you
*NL*
know
she
'd
been
called
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Called
away
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
best
parasol
!
I
lent
it
to
that
goose
of
a
Katie
,
because
it
*NL*
matched
her
ribbons
,
and
the
careless
thing
must
have
dropped
it
here
.
*NL*
We
Blenkers
are
all
like
that
...
real
Bohemians
!
''
Recovering
the
*NL*
sunshade
with
a
powerful
hand
she
unfurled
it
and
suspended
its
rosy
*NL*
dome
above
her
head
.
``
Yes
,
Ellen
was
called
away
yesterday
:
she
lets
*NL*
us
call
her
Ellen
,
you
know
.
A
telegram
came
from
Boston
:
she
said
she
*NL*
might
be
gone
for
two
days
.
I
do
LOVE
the
way
she
does
her
hair
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
Miss
Blenker
rambled
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
continued
to
stare
through
her
as
though
she
had
been
*NL*
transparent
.
All
he
saw
was
the
trumpery
parasol
that
arched
its
*NL*
pinkness
above
her
giggling
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
he
ventured
:
``
You
do
n't
happen
to
know
why
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
went
to
Boston
?
I
hope
it
was
not
on
account
of
bad
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Blenker
took
this
with
a
cheerful
incredulity
.
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
so
.
She
did
n't
tell
us
what
was
in
the
telegram
.
I
think
she
*NL*
did
n't
want
the
Marchioness
to
know
.
She
's
so
romantic-looking
,
is
n't
*NL*
she
?
Does
n't
she
remind
you
of
Mrs.
Scott-Siddons
when
she
reads
`
Lady
*NL*
Geraldine
's
Courtship
'
?
Did
you
never
hear
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
dealing
hurriedly
with
crowding
thoughts
.
His
whole
future
*NL*
seemed
suddenly
to
be
unrolled
before
him
;
and
passing
down
its
endless
*NL*
emptiness
he
saw
the
dwindling
figure
of
a
man
to
whom
nothing
was
ever
*NL*
to
happen
.
He
glanced
about
him
at
the
unpruned
garden
,
the
*NL*
tumble-down
house
,
and
the
oak-grove
under
which
the
dusk
was
*NL*
gathering
.
It
had
seemed
so
exactly
the
place
in
which
he
ought
to
*NL*
have
found
Madame
Olenska
;
and
she
was
far
away
,
and
even
the
pink
*NL*
sunshade
was
not
hers
...
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
and
hesitated
.
``
You
do
n't
know
,
I
suppose
--
I
shall
be
in
*NL*
Boston
tomorrow
.
If
I
could
manage
to
see
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
Miss
Blenker
was
losing
interest
in
him
,
though
her
smile
*NL*
persisted
.
``
Oh
,
of
course
;
how
lovely
of
you
!
She
's
staying
at
the
*NL*
Parker
House
;
it
must
be
horrible
there
in
this
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
Archer
was
but
intermittently
aware
of
the
remarks
they
*NL*
exchanged
.
He
could
only
remember
stoutly
resisting
her
entreaty
that
*NL*
he
should
await
the
returning
family
and
have
high
tea
with
them
before
*NL*
he
drove
home
.
At
length
,
with
his
hostess
still
at
his
side
,
he
*NL*
passed
out
of
range
of
the
wooden
Cupid
,
unfastened
his
horses
and
*NL*
drove
off
.
At
the
turn
of
the
lane
he
saw
Miss
Blenker
standing
at
the
*NL*
gate
and
waving
the
pink
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
Archer
got
out
of
the
Fall
River
train
,
he
*NL*
emerged
upon
a
steaming
midsummer
Boston
.
The
streets
near
the
station
*NL*
were
full
of
the
smell
of
beer
and
coffee
and
decaying
fruit
and
a
*NL*
shirt-sleeved
populace
moved
through
them
with
the
intimate
abandon
of
*NL*
boarders
going
down
the
passage
to
the
bathroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
found
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
Somerset
Club
for
breakfast
.
Even
*NL*
the
fashionable
quarters
had
the
air
of
untidy
domesticity
to
which
no
*NL*
excess
of
heat
ever
degrades
the
European
cities
.
Care-takers
in
*NL*
calico
lounged
on
the
door-steps
of
the
wealthy
,
and
the
Common
looked
*NL*
like
a
pleasure-ground
on
the
morrow
of
a
Masonic
picnic
.
If
Archer
*NL*
had
tried
to
imagine
Ellen
Olenska
in
improbable
scenes
he
could
not
*NL*
have
called
up
any
into
which
it
was
more
difficult
to
fit
her
than
*NL*
this
heat-prostrated
and
deserted
Boston
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
breakfasted
with
appetite
and
method
,
beginning
with
a
slice
of
*NL*
melon
,
and
studying
a
morning
paper
while
he
waited
for
his
toast
and
*NL*
scrambled
eggs
.
A
new
sense
of
energy
and
activity
had
possessed
him
*NL*
ever
since
he
had
announced
to
May
the
night
before
that
he
had
*NL*
business
in
Boston
,
and
should
take
the
Fall
River
boat
that
night
and
*NL*
go
on
to
New
York
the
following
evening
.
It
had
always
been
understood
*NL*
that
he
would
return
to
town
early
in
the
week
,
and
when
he
got
back
*NL*
from
his
expedition
to
Portsmouth
a
letter
from
the
office
,
which
fate
*NL*
had
conspicuously
placed
on
a
corner
of
the
hall
table
,
sufficed
to
*NL*
justify
his
sudden
change
of
plan
.
He
was
even
ashamed
of
the
ease
*NL*
with
which
the
whole
thing
had
been
done
:
it
reminded
him
,
for
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
moment
,
of
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
masterly
contrivances
for
*NL*
securing
his
freedom
.
But
this
did
not
long
trouble
him
,
for
he
was
*NL*
not
in
an
analytic
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
he
smoked
a
cigarette
and
glanced
over
the
Commercial
*NL*
Advertiser
.
While
he
was
thus
engaged
two
or
three
men
he
knew
came
*NL*
in
,
and
the
usual
greetings
were
exchanged
:
it
was
the
same
world
after
*NL*
all
,
though
he
had
such
a
queer
sense
of
having
slipped
through
the
*NL*
meshes
of
time
and
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
finding
that
it
was
half-past
nine
got
up
*NL*
and
went
into
the
writing-room
.
There
he
wrote
a
few
lines
,
and
*NL*
ordered
a
messenger
to
take
a
cab
to
the
Parker
House
and
wait
for
the
*NL*
answer
.
He
then
sat
down
behind
another
newspaper
and
tried
to
*NL*
calculate
how
long
it
would
take
a
cab
to
get
to
the
Parker
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
was
out
,
sir
,
''
he
suddenly
heard
a
waiter
's
voice
at
his
*NL*
elbow
;
and
he
stammered
:
``
Out
?
--
''
as
if
it
were
a
word
in
a
strange
*NL*
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
went
into
the
hall
.
It
must
be
a
mistake
:
she
could
not
*NL*
be
out
at
that
hour
.
He
flushed
with
anger
at
his
own
stupidity
:
why
*NL*
had
he
not
sent
the
note
as
soon
as
he
arrived
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
his
hat
and
stick
and
went
forth
into
the
street
.
The
city
*NL*
had
suddenly
become
as
strange
and
vast
and
empty
as
if
he
were
a
*NL*
traveller
from
distant
lands
.
For
a
moment
he
stood
on
the
door-step
*NL*
hesitating
;
then
he
decided
to
go
to
the
Parker
House
.
What
if
the
*NL*
messenger
had
been
misinformed
,
and
she
were
still
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
to
walk
across
the
Common
;
and
on
the
first
bench
,
under
a
*NL*
tree
,
he
saw
her
sitting
.
She
had
a
grey
silk
sunshade
over
her
*NL*
head
--
how
could
he
ever
have
imagined
her
with
a
pink
one
?
As
he
*NL*
approached
he
was
struck
by
her
listless
attitude
:
she
sat
there
as
if
*NL*
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
.
He
saw
her
drooping
profile
,
and
the
knot
*NL*
of
hair
fastened
low
in
the
neck
under
her
dark
hat
,
and
the
long
*NL*
wrinkled
glove
on
the
hand
that
held
the
sunshade
.
He
came
a
step
or
*NL*
two
nearer
,
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
''
--
she
said
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
a
startled
look
on
*NL*
her
face
;
but
in
another
moment
it
gave
way
to
a
slow
smile
of
wonder
*NL*
and
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
''
--
she
murmured
again
,
on
a
different
note
,
as
he
stood
looking
down
*NL*
at
her
;
and
without
rising
she
made
a
place
for
him
on
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
here
on
business
--
just
got
here
,
''
Archer
explained
;
and
,
without
*NL*
knowing
why
,
he
suddenly
began
to
feign
astonishment
at
seeing
her
.
*NL*
``
But
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
wilderness
?
''
He
had
really
no
*NL*
idea
what
he
was
saying
:
he
felt
as
if
he
were
shouting
at
her
across
*NL*
endless
distances
,
and
she
might
vanish
again
before
he
could
overtake
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Oh
,
I
'm
here
on
business
too
,
''
she
answered
,
turning
her
head
*NL*
toward
him
so
that
they
were
face
to
face
.
The
words
hardly
reached
*NL*
him
:
he
was
aware
only
of
her
voice
,
and
of
the
startling
fact
that
not
*NL*
an
echo
of
it
had
remained
in
his
memory
.
He
had
not
even
remembered
*NL*
that
it
was
low-pitched
,
with
a
faint
roughness
on
the
consonants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
your
hair
differently
,
''
he
said
,
his
heart
beating
as
if
he
had
*NL*
uttered
something
irrevocable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Differently
?
No
--
it
's
only
that
I
do
it
as
best
I
can
when
I
'm
*NL*
without
Nastasia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nastasia
;
but
is
n't
she
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
'm
alone
.
For
two
days
it
was
not
worth
while
to
bring
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
alone
--
at
the
Parker
House
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
a
flash
of
her
old
malice
.
``
Does
it
strike
you
*NL*
as
dangerous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
dangerous
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
unconventional
?
I
see
;
I
suppose
it
is
.
''
She
considered
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
I
had
n't
thought
of
it
,
because
I
've
just
done
something
so
*NL*
much
more
unconventional
.
''
The
faint
tinge
of
irony
lingered
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
``
I
've
just
refused
to
take
back
a
sum
of
money
--
that
belonged
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sprang
up
and
moved
a
step
or
two
away
.
She
had
furled
her
*NL*
parasol
and
sat
absently
drawing
patterns
on
the
gravel
.
Presently
he
*NL*
came
back
and
stood
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
--
has
come
here
to
meet
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
offer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
refused
--
because
of
the
conditions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
refused
,
''
she
said
after
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
by
her
again
.
``
What
were
the
conditions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
were
not
onerous
:
just
to
sit
at
the
head
of
his
table
now
*NL*
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
interval
of
silence
.
Archer
's
heart
had
slammed
*NL*
itself
shut
in
the
queer
way
it
had
,
and
he
sat
vainly
groping
for
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
you
back
--
at
any
price
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
a
considerable
price
.
At
least
the
sum
is
considerable
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
again
,
beating
about
the
question
he
felt
he
must
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
meet
him
here
that
you
came
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
,
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
.
``
Meet
him
--
my
husband
?
HERE
?
*NL*
At
this
season
he
's
always
at
Cowes
or
Baden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
sent
some
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
a
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
No
;
just
a
message
.
He
never
writes
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
've
had
more
than
one
letter
from
him
.
''
The
allusion
brought
*NL*
the
colour
to
her
cheek
,
and
it
reflected
itself
in
Archer
's
vivid
*NL*
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
he
never
write
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
?
What
does
one
have
secretaries
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
's
blush
deepened
.
She
had
pronounced
the
word
as
if
it
*NL*
had
no
more
significance
than
any
other
in
her
vocabulary
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
ask
:
``
Did
he
send
his
*NL*
secretary
,
then
?
''
But
the
remembrance
of
Count
Olenski
's
only
letter
*NL*
to
his
wife
was
too
present
to
him
.
He
paused
again
,
and
then
took
*NL*
another
plunge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
person
?
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
emissary
?
The
emissary
,
''
Madame
Olenska
rejoined
,
still
smiling
,
*NL*
``
might
,
for
all
I
care
,
have
left
already
;
but
he
has
insisted
on
*NL*
waiting
till
this
evening
...
in
case
...
on
the
chance
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
came
out
here
to
think
the
chance
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
out
to
get
a
breath
of
air
.
The
hotel
's
too
stifling
.
I
'm
*NL*
taking
the
afternoon
train
back
to
Portsmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
silent
,
not
looking
at
each
other
,
but
straight
ahead
at
the
*NL*
people
passing
along
the
path
.
Finally
she
turned
her
eyes
again
to
*NL*
his
face
and
said
:
``
You
're
not
changed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
like
answering
:
``
I
was
,
till
I
saw
you
again
;
''
but
instead
he
*NL*
stood
up
abruptly
and
glanced
about
him
at
the
untidy
sweltering
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
horrible
.
Why
should
n't
we
go
out
a
little
on
the
bay
?
*NL*
There
's
a
breeze
,
and
it
will
be
cooler
.
We
might
take
the
steamboat
*NL*
down
to
Point
Arley
.
''
She
glanced
up
at
him
hesitatingly
and
he
went
*NL*
on
:
``
On
a
Monday
morning
there
wo
n't
be
anybody
on
the
boat
.
My
train
*NL*
does
n't
leave
till
evening
:
I
'm
going
back
to
New
York
.
Why
should
n't
*NL*
we
?
''
he
insisted
,
looking
down
at
her
;
and
suddenly
he
broke
out
:
*NL*
``
Have
n't
we
done
all
we
could
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
''
--
she
murmured
again
.
She
stood
up
and
reopened
her
sunshade
,
*NL*
glancing
about
her
as
if
to
take
counsel
of
the
scene
,
and
assure
*NL*
herself
of
the
impossibility
of
remaining
in
it
.
Then
her
eyes
*NL*
returned
to
his
face
.
``
You
must
n't
say
things
like
that
to
me
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
say
anything
you
like
;
or
nothing
.
I
wo
n't
open
my
mouth
unless
*NL*
you
tell
me
to
.
What
harm
can
it
do
to
anybody
?
All
I
want
is
to
*NL*
listen
to
you
,
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
out
a
little
gold-faced
watch
on
an
enamelled
chain
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
do
n't
calculate
,
''
he
broke
out
;
``
give
me
the
day
!
I
want
to
get
you
*NL*
away
from
that
man
.
At
what
time
was
he
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
colour
rose
again
.
``
At
eleven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
come
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
be
afraid
--
if
I
do
n't
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
you
either
--
if
you
do
.
I
swear
I
only
want
to
hear
about
you
,
to
*NL*
know
what
you
've
been
doing
.
It
's
a
hundred
years
since
we
've
met
--
it
*NL*
may
be
another
hundred
before
we
meet
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
wavered
,
her
anxious
eyes
on
his
face
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
come
*NL*
down
to
the
beach
to
fetch
me
,
the
day
I
was
at
Granny
's
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
did
n't
look
round
--
because
you
did
n't
know
I
was
there
.
I
*NL*
swore
I
would
n't
unless
you
looked
round
.
''
He
laughed
as
the
*NL*
childishness
of
the
confession
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
did
n't
look
round
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
were
there
;
when
you
drove
in
I
recognised
the
ponies
.
So
*NL*
I
went
down
to
the
beach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
away
from
me
as
far
as
you
could
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
in
a
low
voice
:
``
To
get
away
from
you
as
far
as
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
out
again
,
this
time
in
boyish
satisfaction
.
``
Well
,
you
see
*NL*
it
's
no
use
.
I
may
as
well
tell
you
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
the
business
I
*NL*
came
here
for
was
just
to
find
you
.
But
,
look
here
,
we
must
start
or
*NL*
we
shall
miss
our
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
boat
?
''
She
frowned
perplexedly
,
and
then
smiled
.
``
Oh
,
but
I
must
*NL*
go
back
to
the
hotel
first
:
I
must
leave
a
note
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
many
notes
as
you
please
.
You
can
write
here
.
''
He
drew
out
a
*NL*
note-case
and
one
of
the
new
stylographic
pens
.
``
I
've
even
got
an
*NL*
envelope
--
you
see
how
everything
's
predestined
!
There
--
steady
the
*NL*
thing
on
your
knee
,
and
I
'll
get
the
pen
going
in
a
second
.
They
have
*NL*
to
be
humoured
;
wait
--
''
He
banged
the
hand
that
held
the
pen
against
*NL*
the
back
of
the
bench
.
``
It
's
like
jerking
down
the
mercury
in
a
*NL*
thermometer
:
just
a
trick
.
Now
try
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
,
and
bending
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
he
had
laid
on
*NL*
his
note-case
,
began
to
write
.
Archer
walked
away
a
few
steps
,
staring
*NL*
with
radiant
unseeing
eyes
at
the
passersby
,
who
,
in
their
turn
,
paused
*NL*
to
stare
at
the
unwonted
sight
of
a
fashionably-dressed
lady
writing
a
*NL*
note
on
her
knee
on
a
bench
in
the
Common
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
slipped
the
sheet
into
the
envelope
,
wrote
a
name
on
it
,
*NL*
and
put
it
into
her
pocket
.
Then
she
too
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
back
toward
Beacon
Street
,
and
near
the
club
Archer
caught
*NL*
sight
of
the
plush-lined
``
herdic
''
which
had
carried
his
note
to
the
*NL*
Parker
House
,
and
whose
driver
was
reposing
from
this
effort
by
bathing
*NL*
his
brow
at
the
corner
hydrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
everything
was
predestined
!
Here
's
a
cab
for
us
.
You
*NL*
see
!
''
They
laughed
,
astonished
at
the
miracle
of
picking
up
a
public
*NL*
conveyance
at
that
hour
,
and
in
that
unlikely
spot
,
in
a
city
where
*NL*
cab-stands
were
still
a
``
foreign
''
novelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
saw
that
there
was
time
to
drive
to
the
*NL*
Parker
House
before
going
to
the
steamboat
landing
.
They
rattled
*NL*
through
the
hot
streets
and
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
held
out
his
hand
for
the
letter
.
``
Shall
I
take
it
in
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
;
but
Madame
Olenska
,
shaking
her
head
,
sprang
out
and
disappeared
*NL*
through
the
glazed
doors
.
It
was
barely
half-past
ten
;
but
what
if
the
*NL*
emissary
,
impatient
for
her
reply
,
and
not
knowing
how
else
to
employ
*NL*
his
time
,
were
already
seated
among
the
travellers
with
cooling
drinks
*NL*
at
their
elbows
of
whom
Archer
had
caught
a
glimpse
as
she
went
in
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
,
pacing
up
and
down
before
the
herdic
.
A
Sicilian
youth
with
*NL*
eyes
like
Nastasia
's
offered
to
shine
his
boots
,
and
an
Irish
matron
to
*NL*
sell
him
peaches
;
and
every
few
moments
the
doors
opened
to
let
out
hot
*NL*
men
with
straw
hats
tilted
far
back
,
who
glanced
at
him
as
they
went
*NL*
by
.
He
marvelled
that
the
door
should
open
so
often
,
and
that
all
the
*NL*
people
it
let
out
should
look
so
like
each
other
,
and
so
like
all
the
*NL*
other
hot
men
who
,
at
that
hour
,
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
*NL*
land
,
were
passing
continuously
in
and
out
of
the
swinging
doors
of
*NL*
hotels
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
suddenly
,
came
a
face
that
he
could
not
relate
to
the
other
*NL*
faces
.
He
caught
but
a
flash
of
it
,
for
his
pacings
had
carried
him
to
*NL*
the
farthest
point
of
his
beat
,
and
it
was
in
turning
back
to
the
hotel
*NL*
that
he
saw
,
in
a
group
of
typical
countenances
--
the
lank
and
weary
,
*NL*
the
round
and
surprised
,
the
lantern-jawed
and
mild
--
this
other
face
*NL*
that
was
so
many
more
things
at
once
,
and
things
so
different
.
It
was
*NL*
that
of
a
young
man
,
pale
too
,
and
half-extinguished
by
the
heat
,
or
*NL*
worry
,
or
both
,
but
somehow
,
quicker
,
vivider
,
more
conscious
;
or
*NL*
perhaps
seeming
so
because
he
was
so
different
.
Archer
hung
a
moment
*NL*
on
a
thin
thread
of
memory
,
but
it
snapped
and
floated
off
with
the
*NL*
disappearing
face
--
apparently
that
of
some
foreign
business
man
,
*NL*
looking
doubly
foreign
in
such
a
setting
.
He
vanished
in
the
stream
of
*NL*
passersby
,
and
Archer
resumed
his
patrol
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
care
to
be
seen
watch
in
hand
within
view
of
the
hotel
,
and
*NL*
his
unaided
reckoning
of
the
lapse
of
time
led
him
to
conclude
that
,
if
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
was
so
long
in
reappearing
,
it
could
only
be
because
she
*NL*
had
met
the
emissary
and
been
waylaid
by
him
.
At
the
thought
Archer
's
*NL*
apprehension
rose
to
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
does
n't
come
soon
I
'll
go
in
and
find
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doors
swung
open
again
and
she
was
at
his
side
.
They
got
into
the
*NL*
herdic
,
and
as
it
drove
off
he
took
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
she
had
*NL*
been
absent
just
three
minutes
.
In
the
clatter
of
loose
windows
that
*NL*
made
talk
impossible
they
bumped
over
the
disjointed
cobblestones
to
*NL*
the
wharf
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Seated
side
by
side
on
a
bench
of
the
half-empty
boat
they
found
that
*NL*
they
had
hardly
anything
to
say
to
each
other
,
or
rather
that
what
they
*NL*
had
to
say
communicated
itself
best
in
the
blessed
silence
of
their
*NL*
release
and
their
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
paddle-wheels
began
to
turn
,
and
wharves
and
shipping
to
recede
*NL*
through
the
veil
of
heat
,
it
seemed
to
Archer
that
everything
in
the
*NL*
old
familiar
world
of
habit
was
receding
also
.
He
longed
to
ask
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
if
she
did
not
have
the
same
feeling
:
the
feeling
that
they
*NL*
were
starting
on
some
long
voyage
from
which
they
might
never
return
.
*NL*
But
he
was
afraid
to
say
it
,
or
anything
else
that
might
disturb
the
*NL*
delicate
balance
of
her
trust
in
him
.
In
reality
he
had
no
wish
to
*NL*
betray
that
trust
.
There
had
been
days
and
nights
when
the
memory
of
*NL*
their
kiss
had
burned
and
burned
on
his
lips
;
the
day
before
even
,
on
*NL*
the
drive
to
Portsmouth
,
the
thought
of
her
had
run
through
him
like
*NL*
fire
;
but
now
that
she
was
beside
him
,
and
they
were
drifting
forth
*NL*
into
this
unknown
world
,
they
seemed
to
have
reached
the
kind
of
deeper
*NL*
nearness
that
a
touch
may
sunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
boat
left
the
harbour
and
turned
seaward
a
breeze
stirred
about
*NL*
them
and
the
bay
broke
up
into
long
oily
undulations
,
then
into
ripples
*NL*
tipped
with
spray
.
The
fog
of
sultriness
still
hung
over
the
city
,
but
*NL*
ahead
lay
a
fresh
world
of
ruffled
waters
,
and
distant
promontories
*NL*
with
light-houses
in
the
sun
.
Madame
Olenska
,
leaning
back
against
the
*NL*
boat-rail
,
drank
in
the
coolness
between
parted
lips
.
She
had
wound
a
*NL*
long
veil
about
her
hat
,
but
it
left
her
face
uncovered
,
and
Archer
was
*NL*
struck
by
the
tranquil
gaiety
of
her
expression
.
She
seemed
to
take
*NL*
their
adventure
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
to
be
neither
in
fear
of
*NL*
unexpected
encounters
,
nor
-LRB-
what
was
worse
-RRB-
unduly
elated
by
their
*NL*
possibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
bare
dining-room
of
the
inn
,
which
he
had
hoped
they
would
have
*NL*
to
themselves
,
they
found
a
strident
party
of
innocent-looking
young
*NL*
men
and
women
--
school-teachers
on
a
holiday
,
the
landlord
told
*NL*
them
--
and
Archer
's
heart
sank
at
the
idea
of
having
to
talk
through
*NL*
their
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
hopeless
--
I
'll
ask
for
a
private
room
,
''
he
said
;
and
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
,
without
offering
any
objection
,
waited
while
he
went
in
search
*NL*
of
it
.
The
room
opened
on
a
long
wooden
verandah
,
with
the
sea
coming
*NL*
in
at
the
windows
.
It
was
bare
and
cool
,
with
a
table
covered
with
a
*NL*
coarse
checkered
cloth
and
adorned
by
a
bottle
of
pickles
and
a
*NL*
blueberry
pie
under
a
cage
.
No
more
guileless-looking
cabinet
*NL*
particulier
ever
offered
its
shelter
to
a
clandestine
couple
:
Archer
*NL*
fancied
he
saw
the
sense
of
its
reassurance
in
the
faintly
amused
smile
*NL*
with
which
Madame
Olenska
sat
down
opposite
to
him
.
A
woman
who
had
*NL*
run
away
from
her
husband
--
and
reputedly
with
another
man
--
was
likely
*NL*
to
have
mastered
the
art
of
taking
things
for
granted
;
but
something
in
*NL*
the
quality
of
her
composure
took
the
edge
from
his
irony
.
By
being
so
*NL*
quiet
,
so
unsurprised
and
so
simple
she
had
managed
to
brush
away
the
*NL*
conventions
and
make
him
feel
that
to
seek
to
be
alone
was
the
natural
*NL*
thing
for
two
old
friends
who
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
...
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lunched
slowly
and
meditatively
,
with
mute
intervals
between
*NL*
rushes
of
talk
;
for
,
the
spell
once
broken
,
they
had
much
to
say
,
and
*NL*
yet
moments
when
saying
became
the
mere
accompaniment
to
long
duologues
*NL*
of
silence
.
Archer
kept
the
talk
from
his
own
affairs
,
not
with
*NL*
conscious
intention
but
because
he
did
not
want
to
miss
a
word
of
her
*NL*
history
;
and
leaning
on
the
table
,
her
chin
resting
on
her
clasped
*NL*
hands
,
she
talked
to
him
of
the
year
and
a
half
since
they
had
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
grown
tired
of
what
people
called
``
society
''
;
New
York
was
kind
,
*NL*
it
was
almost
oppressively
hospitable
;
she
should
never
forget
the
way
*NL*
in
which
it
had
welcomed
her
back
;
but
after
the
first
flush
of
novelty
*NL*
she
had
found
herself
,
as
she
phrased
it
,
too
``
different
''
to
care
for
*NL*
the
things
it
cared
about
--
and
so
she
had
decided
to
try
Washington
,
*NL*
where
one
was
supposed
to
meet
more
varieties
of
people
and
of
opinion
.
*NL*
And
on
the
whole
she
should
probably
settle
down
in
Washington
,
and
*NL*
make
a
home
there
for
poor
Medora
,
who
had
worn
out
the
patience
of
all
*NL*
her
other
relations
just
at
the
time
when
she
most
needed
looking
after
*NL*
and
protecting
from
matrimonial
perils
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Dr.
Carver
--
are
n't
you
afraid
of
Dr.
Carver
?
I
hear
he
's
been
*NL*
staying
with
you
at
the
Blenkers
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
.
``
Oh
,
the
Carver
danger
is
over
.
Dr.
Carver
is
a
very
*NL*
clever
man
.
He
wants
a
rich
wife
to
finance
his
plans
,
and
Medora
is
*NL*
simply
a
good
advertisement
as
a
convert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
convert
to
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
sorts
of
new
and
crazy
social
schemes
.
But
,
do
you
know
,
they
*NL*
interest
me
more
than
the
blind
conformity
to
tradition
--
somebody
*NL*
else
's
tradition
--
that
I
see
among
our
own
friends
.
It
seems
stupid
to
*NL*
have
discovered
America
only
to
make
it
into
a
copy
of
another
*NL*
country
.
''
She
smiled
across
the
table
.
``
Do
you
suppose
Christopher
*NL*
Columbus
would
have
taken
all
that
trouble
just
to
go
to
the
Opera
with
*NL*
the
Selfridge
Merrys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
changed
colour
.
``
And
Beaufort
--
do
you
say
these
things
to
*NL*
Beaufort
?
''
he
asked
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
him
for
a
long
time
.
But
I
used
to
;
and
he
*NL*
understands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
it
's
what
I
've
always
told
you
;
you
do
n't
like
us
.
And
you
like
*NL*
Beaufort
because
he
's
so
unlike
us
.
''
He
looked
about
the
bare
room
and
*NL*
out
at
the
bare
beach
and
the
row
of
stark
white
village
houses
strung
*NL*
along
the
shore
.
``
We
're
damnably
dull
.
We
've
no
character
,
no
colour
,
*NL*
no
variety
.
--
I
wonder
,
''
he
broke
out
,
``
why
you
do
n't
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
darkened
,
and
he
expected
an
indignant
rejoinder
.
But
she
sat
*NL*
silent
,
as
if
thinking
over
what
he
had
said
,
and
he
grew
frightened
*NL*
lest
she
should
answer
that
she
wondered
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
she
said
:
``
I
believe
it
's
because
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
make
the
confession
more
dispassionately
,
or
in
a
*NL*
tone
less
encouraging
to
the
vanity
of
the
person
addressed
.
Archer
*NL*
reddened
to
the
temples
,
but
dared
not
move
or
speak
:
it
was
as
if
her
*NL*
words
had
been
some
rare
butterfly
that
the
least
motion
might
drive
*NL*
off
on
startled
wings
,
but
that
might
gather
a
flock
about
it
if
it
*NL*
were
left
undisturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
least
,
''
she
continued
,
``
it
was
you
who
made
me
understand
that
*NL*
under
the
dullness
there
are
things
so
fine
and
sensitive
and
delicate
*NL*
that
even
those
I
most
cared
for
in
my
other
life
look
cheap
in
*NL*
comparison
.
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
myself
''
--
she
drew
together
her
*NL*
troubled
brows
--
``
but
it
seems
as
if
I
'd
never
before
understood
with
*NL*
how
much
that
is
hard
and
shabby
and
base
the
most
exquisite
pleasures
*NL*
may
be
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exquisite
pleasures
--
it
's
something
to
have
had
them
!
''
he
felt
like
*NL*
retorting
;
but
the
appeal
in
her
eyes
kept
him
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
you
--
and
with
*NL*
myself
.
For
a
long
time
I
've
hoped
this
chance
would
come
:
that
I
*NL*
might
tell
you
how
you
've
helped
me
,
what
you
've
made
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sat
staring
beneath
frowning
brows
.
He
interrupted
her
with
a
*NL*
laugh
.
``
And
what
do
you
make
out
that
you
've
made
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paled
a
little
.
``
Of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
for
I
'm
of
your
making
much
more

the
man
who

one
woman

*NL*
*NL*
Her
paleness
turned
to
a
fugitive
flush
.
``
I
thought
--
you
promised

you
*NL*
were
not
to
say
such
things
today

*NL*
``
Ah
--
how
like
a
woman
!
None
of
you
will
ever
see
a
bad
business
*NL*
through
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lowered
her
voice
.
``
IS
it
a
bad
business
--
for
May
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
the
window
,
drumming
against
the
raised
sash
,
and
feeling
*NL*
in
every
fibre
the
wistful
tenderness
with
which
she
had
spoken
her
*NL*
cousin
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
that
's
the
thing
we
've
always
got
to
think
of
--
have
n't
we
--
by
your
*NL*
own
showing
?
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
showing
?
''
he
echoed
,
his
blank
eyes
still
on
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
if
not
,
''
she
continued
,
pursuing
her
own
thought
with
a
painful
*NL*
application
,
``
if
it
's
not
worth
while
to
have
given
up
,
to
have
missed
*NL*
things
,
so
that
others
may
be
saved
from
disillusionment
and
*NL*
misery
--
then
everything
I
came
home
for
,
everything
that
made
my
other
*NL*
life
seem
by
contrast
so
bare
and
so
poor
because
no
one
there
took
*NL*
account
of
them
--
all
these
things
are
a
sham
or
a
dream
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
around
without
moving
from
his
place
.
``
And
in
that
case
*NL*
there
's
no
reason
on
earth
why
you
should
n't
go
back
?
''
he
concluded
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
clinging
to
him
desperately
.
``
Oh
,
IS
there
no
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
staked
your
all
on
the
success
of
my
marriage
.
My
*NL*
marriage
,
''
he
said
savagely
,
``
is
n't
going
to
be
a
sight
to
keep
you
*NL*
here
.
''
She
made
no
answer
,
and
he
went
on
:
``
What
's
the
use
?
You
gave
*NL*
me
my
first
glimpse
of
a
real
life
,
and
at
the
same
moment
you
asked
me
*NL*
to
go
on
with
a
sham
one
.
It
's
beyond
human
enduring
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
say
that
;
when
I
'm
enduring
it
!
''
she
burst
out
,
her
eyes
*NL*
filling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
arms
had
dropped
along
the
table
,
and
she
sat
with
her
face
*NL*
abandoned
to
his
gaze
as
if
in
the
recklessness
of
a
desperate
peril
.
*NL*
The
face
exposed
her
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
her
whole
person
,
with
*NL*
the
soul
behind
it
:
Archer
stood
dumb
,
overwhelmed
by
what
it
suddenly
*NL*
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
too
--
oh
,
all
this
time
,
you
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
,
she
let
the
tears
on
her
lids
overflow
and
run
slowly
*NL*
downward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
the
width
of
the
room
was
still
between
them
,
and
neither
made
any
*NL*
show
of
moving
.
Archer
was
conscious
of
a
curious
indifference
to
her
*NL*
bodily
presence
:
he
would
hardly
have
been
aware
of
it
if
one
of
the
*NL*
hands
she
had
flung
out
on
the
table
had
not
drawn
his
gaze
as
on
the
*NL*
occasion
when
,
in
the
little
Twenty-third
Street
house
,
he
had
kept
his
*NL*
eye
on
it
in
order
not
to
look
at
her
face
.
Now
his
imagination
spun
*NL*
about
the
hand
as
about
the
edge
of
a
vortex
;
but
still
he
made
no
*NL*
effort
to
draw
nearer
.
He
had
known
the
love
that
is
fed
on
caresses
*NL*
and
feeds
them
;
but
this
passion
that
was
closer
than
his
bones
was
not
*NL*
to
be
superficially
satisfied
.
His
one
terror
was
to
do
anything
which
*NL*
might
efface
the
sound
and
impression
of
her
words
;
his
one
thought
,
*NL*
that
he
should
never
again
feel
quite
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
a
moment
the
sense
of
waste
and
ruin
overcame
him
.
There
*NL*
they
were
,
close
together
and
safe
and
shut
in
;
yet
so
chained
to
their
*NL*
separate
destinies
that
they
might
as
well
have
been
half
the
world
*NL*
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
--
when
you
will
go
back
?
''
he
broke
out
,
a
great
hopeless
*NL*
HOW
ON
EARTH
CAN
I
KEEP
YOU
?
crying
out
to
her
beneath
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
motionless
,
with
lowered
lids
.
``
Oh
--
I
sha
n't
go
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
?
Some
time
,
then
?
Some
time
that
you
already
foresee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
she
raised
her
clearest
eyes
.
``
I
promise
you
:
not
as
long
as
*NL*
you
hold
out
.
Not
as
long
as
we
can
look
straight
at
each
other
like
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
into
his
chair
.
What
her
answer
really
said
was
:
``
If
you
*NL*
lift
a
finger
you
'll
drive
me
back
:
back
to
all
the
abominations
you
*NL*
know
of
,
and
all
the
temptations
you
half
guess
.
''
He
understood
it
as
*NL*
clearly
as
if
she
had
uttered
the
words
,
and
the
thought
kept
him
*NL*
anchored
to
his
side
of
the
table
in
a
kind
of
moved
and
sacred
*NL*
submission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
life
for
you
!
--
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
as
long
as
it
's
a
part
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mine
a
part
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
to
be
all
--
for
either
of
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
;
it
IS
all
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
he
sprang
up
,
forgetting
everything
but
the
sweetness
of
her
*NL*
face
.
She
rose
too
,
not
as
if
to
meet
him
or
to
flee
from
him
,
but
*NL*
quietly
,
as
though
the
worst
of
the
task
were
done
and
she
had
only
to
*NL*
wait
;
so
quietly
that
,
as
he
came
close
,
her
outstretched
hands
acted
*NL*
not
as
a
check
but
as
a
guide
to
him
.
They
fell
into
his
,
while
her
*NL*
arms
,
extended
but
not
rigid
,
kept
him
far
enough
off
to
let
her
*NL*
surrendered
face
say
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
may
have
stood
in
that
way
for
a
long
time
,
or
only
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
;
but
it
was
long
enough
for
her
silence
to
communicate
all
she
*NL*
had
to
say
,
and
for
him
to
feel
that
only
one
thing
mattered
.
He
must
*NL*
do
nothing
to
make
this
meeting
their
last
;
he
must
leave
their
future
*NL*
in
her
care
,
asking
only
that
she
should
keep
fast
hold
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
--
do
n't
be
unhappy
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
break
in
her
voice
,
as
she
*NL*
drew
her
hands
away
;
and
he
answered
:
``
You
wo
n't
go
back
--
you
wo
n't
go
*NL*
back
?
''
as
if
it
were
the
one
possibility
he
could
not
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
go
back
,
''
she
said
;
and
turning
away
she
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
led
the
way
into
the
public
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strident
school-teachers
were
gathering
up
their
possessions
*NL*
preparatory
to
a
straggling
flight
to
the
wharf
;
across
the
beach
lay
*NL*
the
white
steam-boat
at
the
pier
;
and
over
the
sunlit
waters
Boston
*NL*
loomed
in
a
line
of
haze
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
on
the
boat
,
and
in
the
presence
of
others
,
Archer
felt
a
*NL*
tranquillity
of
spirit
that
surprised
as
much
as
it
sustained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
,
according
to
any
current
valuation
,
had
been
a
rather
*NL*
ridiculous
failure
;
he
had
not
so
much
as
touched
Madame
Olenska
's
hand
*NL*
with
his
lips
,
or
extracted
one
word
from
her
that
gave
promise
of
*NL*
farther
opportunities
.
Nevertheless
,
for
a
man
sick
with
unsatisfied
*NL*
love
,
and
parting
for
an
indefinite
period
from
the
object
of
his
*NL*
passion
,
he
felt
himself
almost
humiliatingly
calm
and
comforted
.
It
*NL*
was
the
perfect
balance
she
had
held
between
their
loyalty
to
others
*NL*
and
their
honesty
to
themselves
that
had
so
stirred
and
yet
*NL*
tranquillized
him
;
a
balance
not
artfully
calculated
,
as
her
tears
and
*NL*
her
falterings
showed
,
but
resulting
naturally
from
her
unabashed
*NL*
sincerity
.
It
filled
him
with
a
tender
awe
,
now
the
danger
was
over
,
*NL*
and
made
him
thank
the
fates
that
no
personal
vanity
,
no
sense
of
*NL*
playing
a
part
before
sophisticated
witnesses
,
had
tempted
him
to
tempt
*NL*
her
.
Even
after
they
had
clasped
hands
for
good-bye
at
the
Fall
River
*NL*
station
,
and
he
had
turned
away
alone
,
the
conviction
remained
with
him
*NL*
of
having
saved
out
of
their
meeting
much
more
than
he
had
sacrificed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
back
to
the
club
,
and
went
and
sat
alone
in
the
deserted
*NL*
library
,
turning
and
turning
over
in
his
thoughts
every
separate
second
*NL*
of
their
hours
together
.
It
was
clear
to
him
,
and
it
grew
more
clear
*NL*
under
closer
scrutiny
,
that
if
she
should
finally
decide
on
returning
*NL*
to
Europe
--
returning
to
her
husband
--
it
would
not
be
because
her
old
*NL*
life
tempted
her
,
even
on
the
new
terms
offered
.
No
:
she
would
go
only
*NL*
if
she
felt
herself
becoming
a
temptation
to
Archer
,
a
temptation
to
*NL*
fall
away
from
the
standard
they
had
both
set
up
.
Her
choice
would
be
*NL*
to
stay
near
him
as
long
as
he
did
not
ask
her
to
come
nearer
;
and
it
*NL*
depended
on
himself
to
keep
her
just
there
,
safe
but
secluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
train
these
thoughts
were
still
with
him
.
They
enclosed
him
in
*NL*
a
kind
of
golden
haze
,
through
which
the
faces
about
him
looked
remote
*NL*
and
indistinct
:
he
had
a
feeling
that
if
he
spoke
to
his
*NL*
fellow-travellers
they
would
not
understand
what
he
was
saying
.
In
*NL*
this
state
of
abstraction
he
found
himself
,
the
following
morning
,
*NL*
waking
to
the
reality
of
a
stifling
September
day
in
New
York
.
The
*NL*
heat-withered
faces
in
the
long
train
streamed
past
him
,
and
he
*NL*
continued
to
stare
at
them
through
the
same
golden
blur
;
but
suddenly
,
*NL*
as
he
left
the
station
,
one
of
the
faces
detached
itself
,
came
closer
*NL*
and
forced
itself
upon
his
consciousness
.
It
was
,
as
he
instantly
*NL*
recalled
,
the
face
of
the
young
man
he
had
seen
,
the
day
before
,
*NL*
passing
out
of
the
Parker
House
,
and
had
noted
as
not
conforming
to
*NL*
type
,
as
not
having
an
American
hotel
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
thing
struck
him
now
;
and
again
he
became
aware
of
a
dim
stir
*NL*
of
former
associations
.
The
young
man
stood
looking
about
him
with
the
*NL*
dazed
air
of
the
foreigner
flung
upon
the
harsh
mercies
of
American
*NL*
travel
;
then
he
advanced
toward
Archer
,
lifted
his
hat
,
and
said
in
*NL*
English
:
``
Surely
,
Monsieur
,
we
met
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
:
in
London
!
''
Archer
grasped
his
hand
with
curiosity
*NL*
and
sympathy
.
``
So
you
DID
get
here
,
after
all
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
casting
*NL*
a
wondering
eye
on
the
astute
and
haggard
little
countenance
of
young
*NL*
Carfry
's
French
tutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
got
here
--
yes
,
''
M.
Riviere
smiled
with
drawn
lips
.
``
But
not
for
*NL*
long
;
I
return
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
''
He
stood
grasping
his
light
*NL*
valise
in
one
neatly
gloved
hand
,
and
gazing
anxiously
,
perplexedly
,
*NL*
almost
appealingly
,
into
Archer
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
Monsieur
,
since
I
've
had
the
good
luck
to
run
across
you
,
if
*NL*
I
might
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
to
suggest
it
:
come
to
luncheon
,
wo
n't
you
?
Down
*NL*
town
,
I
mean
:
if
you
'll
look
me
up
in
my
office
I
'll
take
you
to
a
very
*NL*
decent
restaurant
in
that
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
was
visibly
touched
and
surprised
.
``
You
're
too
kind
.
But
I
*NL*
was
only
going
to
ask
if
you
would
tell
me
how
to
reach
some
sort
of
*NL*
conveyance
.
There
are
no
porters
,
and
no
one
here
seems
to
listen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
:
our
American
stations
must
surprise
you
.
When
you
ask
for
a
*NL*
porter
they
give
you
chewing-gum
.
But
if
you
'll
come
along
I
'll
*NL*
extricate
you
;
and
you
must
really
lunch
with
me
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
after
a
just
perceptible
hesitation
,
replied
,
with
*NL*
profuse
thanks
,
and
in
a
tone
that
did
not
carry
complete
conviction
,
*NL*
that
he
was
already
engaged
;
but
when
they
had
reached
the
comparative
*NL*
reassurance
of
the
street
he
asked
if
he
might
call
that
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
at
ease
in
the
midsummer
leisure
of
the
office
,
fixed
an
hour
*NL*
and
scribbled
his
address
,
which
the
Frenchman
pocketed
with
reiterated
*NL*
thanks
and
a
wide
flourish
of
his
hat
.
A
horse-car
received
him
,
and
*NL*
Archer
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Punctually
at
the
hour
M.
Riviere
appeared
,
shaved
,
smoothed-out
,
but
*NL*
still
unmistakably
drawn
and
serious
.
Archer
was
alone
in
his
office
,
*NL*
and
the
young
man
,
before
accepting
the
seat
he
proffered
,
began
*NL*
abruptly
:
``
I
believe
I
saw
you
,
sir
,
yesterday
in
Boston
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
statement
was
insignificant
enough
,
and
Archer
was
about
to
frame
*NL*
an
assent
when
his
words
were
checked
by
something
mysterious
yet
*NL*
illuminating
in
his
visitor
's
insistent
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extraordinary
,
very
extraordinary
,
''
M.
Riviere
continued
,
``
that
*NL*
we
should
have
met
in
the
circumstances
in
which
I
find
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
circumstances
?
''
Archer
asked
,
wondering
a
little
crudely
if
he
*NL*
needed
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
continued
to
study
him
with
tentative
eyes
.
``
I
have
come
,
*NL*
not
to
look
for
employment
,
as
I
spoke
of
doing
when
we
last
met
,
but
*NL*
on
a
special
mission
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
!
''
Archer
exclaimed
.
In
a
flash
the
two
meetings
had
connected
*NL*
themselves
in
his
mind
.
He
paused
to
take
in
the
situation
thus
*NL*
suddenly
lighted
up
for
him
,
and
M.
Riviere
also
remained
silent
,
as
if
*NL*
aware
that
what
he
had
said
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
special
mission
,
''
Archer
at
length
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Frenchman
,
opening
his
palms
,
raised
them
slightly
,
and
the
*NL*
two
men
continued
to
look
at
each
other
across
the
office-desk
till
*NL*
Archer
roused
himself
to
say
:
``
Do
sit
down
''
;
whereupon
M.
Riviere
*NL*
bowed
,
took
a
distant
chair
,
and
again
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
about
this
mission
that
you
wanted
to
consult
me
?
''
Archer
*NL*
finally
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
bent
his
head
.
``
Not
in
my
own
behalf
:
on
that
score
I
--
I
*NL*
have
fully
dealt
with
myself
.
I
should
like
--
if
I
may
--
to
speak
to
you
*NL*
about
the
Countess
Olenska
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
known
for
the
last
few
minutes
that
the
words
were
coming
;
*NL*
but
when
they
came
they
sent
the
blood
rushing
to
his
temples
as
if
he
*NL*
had
been
caught
by
a
bent-back
branch
in
a
thicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
whose
behalf
,
''
he
said
,
``
do
you
wish
to
do
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
met
the
question
sturdily
.
``
Well
--
I
might
say
HERS
,
if
it
*NL*
did
not
sound
like
a
liberty
.
Shall
I
say
instead
:
on
behalf
of
*NL*
abstract
justice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
considered
him
ironically
.
``
In
other
words
:
you
are
Count
*NL*
Olenski
's
messenger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
his
blush
more
darkly
reflected
in
M.
Riviere
's
sallow
*NL*
countenance
.
``
Not
to
YOU
,
Monsieur
.
If
I
come
to
you
,
it
is
on
quite
*NL*
other
grounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
right
have
you
,
in
the
circumstances
,
to
BE
on
any
other
ground
?
''
*NL*
Archer
retorted
.
``
If
you
're
an
emissary
you
're
an
emissary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
considered
.
``
My
mission
is
over
:
as
far
as
the
Countess
*NL*
Olenska
goes
,
it
has
failed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
''
Archer
rejoined
on
the
same
note
of
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
but
you
can
help
--
''
M.
Riviere
paused
,
turned
his
hat
about
in
*NL*
his
still
carefully
gloved
hands
,
looked
into
its
lining
and
then
back
*NL*
at
Archer
's
face
.
``
You
can
help
,
Monsieur
,
I
am
convinced
,
to
make
it
*NL*
equally
a
failure
with
her
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
pushed
back
his
chair
and
stood
up
.
``
Well
--
and
by
God
I
will
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
.
He
stood
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
staring
down
*NL*
wrathfully
at
the
little
Frenchman
,
whose
face
,
though
he
too
had
*NL*
risen
,
was
still
an
inch
or
two
below
the
line
of
Archer
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
paled
to
his
normal
hue
:
paler
than
that
his
complexion
*NL*
could
hardly
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
devil
,
''
Archer
explosively
continued
,
``
should
you
have
*NL*
thought
--
since
I
suppose
you
're
appealing
to
me
on
the
ground
of
my
*NL*
relationship
to
Madame
Olenska
--
that
I
should
take
a
view
contrary
to
*NL*
the
rest
of
her
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
of
expression
in
M.
Riviere
's
face
was
for
a
time
his
only
*NL*
answer
.
His
look
passed
from
timidity
to
absolute
distress
:
for
a
*NL*
young
man
of
his
usually
resourceful
mien
it
would
have
been
difficult
*NL*
to
appear
more
disarmed
and
defenceless
.
``
Oh
,
Monsieur
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
imagine
,
''
Archer
continued
,
``
why
you
should
have
come
to
me
*NL*
when
there
are
others
so
much
nearer
to
the
Countess
;
still
less
why
*NL*
you
thought
I
should
be
more
accessible
to
the
arguments
I
suppose
you
*NL*
were
sent
over
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
took
this
onslaught
with
a
disconcerting
humility
.
``
The
*NL*
arguments
I
want
to
present
to
you
,
Monsieur
,
are
my
own
and
not
those
*NL*
I
was
sent
over
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
see
still
less
reason
for
listening
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
again
looked
into
his
hat
,
as
if
considering
whether
these
*NL*
last
words
were
not
a
sufficiently
broad
hint
to
put
it
on
and
be
gone
.
*NL*
Then
he
spoke
with
sudden
decision
.
``
Monsieur
--
will
you
tell
me
one
*NL*
thing
?
Is
it
my
right
to
be
here
that
you
question
?
Or
do
you
perhaps
*NL*
believe
the
whole
matter
to
be
already
closed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
quiet
insistence
made
Archer
feel
the
clumsiness
of
his
own
*NL*
bluster
.
M.
Riviere
had
succeeded
in
imposing
himself
:
Archer
,
*NL*
reddening
slightly
,
dropped
into
his
chair
again
,
and
signed
to
the
*NL*
young
man
to
be
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
:
but
why
is
n't
the
matter
closed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
gazed
back
at
him
with
anguish
.
``
You
do
,
then
,
agree
with
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
family
that
,
in
face
of
the
new
proposals
I
have
*NL*
brought
,
it
is
hardly
possible
for
Madame
Olenska
not
to
return
to
her
*NL*
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
Archer
exclaimed
;
and
his
visitor
gave
out
a
low
murmur
of
*NL*
confirmation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
seeing
her
,
I
saw
--
at
Count
Olenski
's
request
--
Mr.
Lovell
*NL*
Mingott
,
with
whom
I
had
several
talks
before
going
to
Boston
.
I
*NL*
understand
that
he
represents
his
mother
's
view
;
and
that
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
's
influence
is
great
throughout
her
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sat
silent
,
with
the
sense
of
clinging
to
the
edge
of
a
sliding
*NL*
precipice
.
The
discovery
that
he
had
been
excluded
from
a
share
in
*NL*
these
negotiations
,
and
even
from
the
knowledge
that
they
were
on
foot
,
*NL*
caused
him
a
surprise
hardly
dulled
by
the
acuter
wonder
of
what
he
was
*NL*
learning
.
He
saw
in
a
flash
that
if
the
family
had
ceased
to
consult
*NL*
him
it
was
because
some
deep
tribal
instinct
warned
them
that
he
was
no
*NL*
longer
on
their
side
;
and
he
recalled
,
with
a
start
of
comprehension
,
a
*NL*
remark
of
May
's
during
their
drive
home
from
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
on
*NL*
the
day
of
the
Archery
Meeting
:
``
Perhaps
,
after
all
,
Ellen
would
be
*NL*
happier
with
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
tumult
of
new
discoveries
Archer
remembered
his
indignant
*NL*
exclamation
,
and
the
fact
that
since
then
his
wife
had
never
named
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
to
him
.
Her
careless
allusion
had
no
doubt
been
the
*NL*
straw
held
up
to
see
which
way
the
wind
blew
;
the
result
had
been
*NL*
reported
to
the
family
,
and
thereafter
Archer
had
been
tacitly
omitted
*NL*
from
their
counsels
.
He
admired
the
tribal
discipline
which
made
May
*NL*
bow
to
this
decision
.
She
would
not
have
done
so
,
he
knew
,
had
her
*NL*
conscience
protested
;
but
she
probably
shared
the
family
view
that
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
would
be
better
off
as
an
unhappy
wife
than
as
a
*NL*
separated
one
,
and
that
there
was
no
use
in
discussing
the
case
with
*NL*
Newland
,
who
had
an
awkward
way
of
suddenly
not
seeming
to
take
the
*NL*
most
fundamental
things
for
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
up
and
met
his
visitor
's
anxious
gaze
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
,
*NL*
Monsieur
--
is
it
possible
you
do
n't
know
--
that
the
family
begin
to
doubt
*NL*
if
they
have
the
right
to
advise
the
Countess
to
refuse
her
husband
's
*NL*
last
proposals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
proposals
you
brought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
proposals
I
brought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
Archer
's
lips
to
exclaim
that
whatever
he
knew
or
did
not
*NL*
know
was
no
concern
of
M.
Riviere
's
;
but
something
in
the
humble
and
*NL*
yet
courageous
tenacity
of
M.
Riviere
's
gaze
made
him
reject
this
*NL*
conclusion
,
and
he
met
the
young
man
's
question
with
another
.
``
What
is
*NL*
your
object
in
speaking
to
me
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
to
wait
a
moment
for
the
answer
.
``
To
beg
you
,
Monsieur
--
to
*NL*
beg
you
with
all
the
force
I
'm
capable
of
--
not
to
let
her
go
back
.
--
Oh
,
*NL*
do
n't
let
her
!
''
M.
Riviere
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
at
him
with
increasing
astonishment
.
There
was
no
*NL*
mistaking
the
sincerity
of
his
distress
or
the
strength
of
his
*NL*
determination
:
he
had
evidently
resolved
to
let
everything
go
by
the
*NL*
board
but
the
supreme
need
of
thus
putting
himself
on
record
.
Archer
*NL*
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
``
if
this
is
the
line
you
took
with
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
reddened
,
but
his
eyes
did
not
falter
.
``
No
,
Monsieur
:
I
*NL*
accepted
my
mission
in
good
faith
.
I
really
believed
--
for
reasons
I
*NL*
need
not
trouble
you
with
--
that
it
would
be
better
for
Madame
Olenska
*NL*
to
recover
her
situation
,
her
fortune
,
the
social
consideration
that
*NL*
her
husband
's
standing
gives
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
supposed
:
you
could
hardly
have
accepted
such
a
mission
*NL*
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
accepted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
--
?
''
Archer
paused
again
,
and
their
eyes
met
in
another
*NL*
protracted
scrutiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Monsieur
,
after
I
had
seen
her
,
after
I
had
listened
to
her
,
I
*NL*
knew
she
was
better
off
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
discharged
my
mission
faithfully
:
I
put
the
Count
's
*NL*
arguments
,
I
stated
his
offers
,
without
adding
any
comment
of
my
own
.
*NL*
The
Countess
was
good
enough
to
listen
patiently
;
she
carried
her
*NL*
goodness
so
far
as
to
see
me
twice
;
she
considered
impartially
all
I
*NL*
had
come
to
say
.
And
it
was
in
the
course
of
these
two
talks
that
I
*NL*
changed
my
mind
,
that
I
came
to
see
things
differently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
ask
what
led
to
this
change
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
seeing
the
change
in
HER
,
''
M.
Riviere
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
in
her
?
Then
you
knew
her
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
's
colour
again
rose
.
``
I
used
to
see
her
in
her
husband
's
*NL*
house
.
I
have
known
Count
Olenski
for
many
years
.
You
can
imagine
*NL*
that
he
would
not
have
sent
a
stranger
on
such
a
mission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
gaze
,
wandering
away
to
the
blank
walls
of
the
office
,
rested
*NL*
on
a
hanging
calendar
surmounted
by
the
rugged
features
of
the
*NL*
President
of
the
United
States
.
That
such
a
conversation
should
be
*NL*
going
on
anywhere
within
the
millions
of
square
miles
subject
to
his
*NL*
rule
seemed
as
strange
as
anything
that
the
imagination
could
invent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
--
what
sort
of
a
change
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Monsieur
,
if
I
could
tell
you
!
''
M.
Riviere
paused
.
``
Tenez
--
the
*NL*
discovery
,
I
suppose
,
of
what
I
'd
never
thought
of
before
:
that
she
's
*NL*
an
American
.
And
that
if
you
're
an
American
of
HER
kind
--
of
your
*NL*
kind
--
things
that
are
accepted
in
certain
other
societies
,
or
at
least
*NL*
put
up
with
as
part
of
a
general
convenient
give-and-take
--
become
*NL*
unthinkable
,
simply
unthinkable
.
If
Madame
Olenska
's
relations
*NL*
understood
what
these
things
were
,
their
opposition
to
her
returning
*NL*
would
no
doubt
be
as
unconditional
as
her
own
;
but
they
seem
to
regard
*NL*
her
husband
's
wish
to
have
her
back
as
proof
of
an
irresistible
longing
*NL*
for
domestic
life
.
''
M.
Riviere
paused
,
and
then
added
:
``
Whereas
it
's
*NL*
far
from
being
as
simple
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
back
to
the
President
of
the
United
States
,
and
then
down
*NL*
at
his
desk
and
at
the
papers
scattered
on
it
.
For
a
second
or
two
he
*NL*
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
.
During
this
interval
he
heard
M.
*NL*
Riviere
's
chair
pushed
back
,
and
was
aware
that
the
young
man
had
*NL*
risen
.
When
he
glanced
up
again
he
saw
that
his
visitor
was
as
moved
*NL*
as
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
Archer
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
thank
me
for
,
Monsieur

it
is
I
,
rather

''
M.
*NL*
Riviere
broke
off
,
as
if
speech
for
him
too
were
difficult
.
``
I
should
*NL*
like
,
though

''
he
continued
in
a
firmer
voice
,
``
to
add
one
thing
.
You
*NL*
asked
me
if
I
was
in
Count
Olenski
's
employ

I
am
at
this
moment
:
I
*NL*
returned
to
him
,
a
few
months
ago
,
for
reasons
of
private
necessity
*NL*
such
as
may
happen
to
any
one
who
has
persons
,
ill
and
older
persons
,
*NL*
dependent
on
him
.
But
from
the
moment
that
I
have
taken
the
step
of
*NL*
coming
here
to
say
these
things
to
you
I
consider
myself
discharged
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
tell
him
so
on
my
return
,
and
give
him
the
reasons
.
That
's
*NL*
all
,
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Riviere
bowed
and
drew
back
a
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
Archer
said
again
,
as
their
hands
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
year
on
the
fifteenth
of
October
Fifth
Avenue
opened
its
*NL*
shutters
,
unrolled
its
carpets
and
hung
up
its
triple
layer
of
*NL*
window-curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
first
of
November
this
household
ritual
was
over
,
and
society
*NL*
had
begun
to
look
about
and
take
stock
of
itself
.
By
the
fifteenth
the
*NL*
season
was
in
full
blast
,
Opera
and
theatres
were
putting
forth
their
*NL*
new
attractions
,
dinner-engagements
were
accumulating
,
and
dates
for
*NL*
dances
being
fixed
.
And
punctually
at
about
this
time
Mrs.
Archer
*NL*
always
said
that
New
York
was
very
much
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Observing
it
from
the
lofty
stand-point
of
a
non-participant
,
she
was
*NL*
able
,
with
the
help
of
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
and
Miss
Sophy
,
to
trace
*NL*
each
new
crack
in
its
surface
,
and
all
the
strange
weeds
pushing
up
*NL*
between
the
ordered
rows
of
social
vegetables
.
It
had
been
one
of
the
*NL*
amusements
of
Archer
's
youth
to
wait
for
this
annual
pronouncement
of
*NL*
his
mother
's
,
and
to
hear
her
enumerate
the
minute
signs
of
*NL*
disintegration
that
his
careless
gaze
had
overlooked
.
For
New
York
,
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
's
mind
,
never
changed
without
changing
for
the
worse
;
and
*NL*
in
this
view
Miss
Sophy
Jackson
heartily
concurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
,
as
became
a
man
of
the
world
,
suspended
his
*NL*
judgment
and
listened
with
an
amused
impartiality
to
the
lamentations
*NL*
of
the
ladies
.
But
even
he
never
denied
that
New
York
had
changed
;
and
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
in
the
winter
of
the
second
year
of
his
marriage
,
was
*NL*
himself
obliged
to
admit
that
if
it
had
not
actually
changed
it
was
*NL*
certainly
changing
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
points
had
been
raised
,
as
usual
,
at
Mrs.
Archer
's
Thanksgiving
*NL*
dinner
.
At
the
date
when
she
was
officially
enjoined
to
give
thanks
*NL*
for
the
blessings
of
the
year
it
was
her
habit
to
take
a
mournful
*NL*
though
not
embittered
stock
of
her
world
,
and
wonder
what
there
was
to
*NL*
be
thankful
for
.
At
any
rate
,
not
the
state
of
society
;
society
,
if
it
*NL*
could
be
said
to
exist
,
was
rather
a
spectacle
on
which
to
call
down
*NL*
Biblical
imprecations
--
and
in
fact
,
every
one
knew
what
the
Reverend
*NL*
Dr.
Ashmore
meant
when
he
chose
a
text
from
Jeremiah
-LRB-
chap
.
ii.
,
verse
*NL*
25
-RRB-
for
his
Thanksgiving
sermon
.
Dr.
Ashmore
,
the
new
Rector
of
St.
*NL*
Matthew
's
,
had
been
chosen
because
he
was
very
``
advanced
''
:
his
sermons
*NL*
were
considered
bold
in
thought
and
novel
in
language
.
When
he
*NL*
fulminated
against
fashionable
society
he
always
spoke
of
its
``
trend
''
;
*NL*
and
to
Mrs.
Archer
it
was
terrifying
and
yet
fascinating
to
feel
*NL*
herself
part
of
a
community
that
was
trending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
doubt
that
Dr.
Ashmore
is
right
:
there
IS
a
marked
trend
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
as
if
it
were
something
visible
and
measurable
,
like
a
crack
*NL*
in
a
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
odd
,
though
,
to
preach
about
it
on
Thanksgiving
,
''
Miss
Jackson
*NL*
opined
;
and
her
hostess
drily
rejoined
:
``
Oh
,
he
means
us
to
give
*NL*
thanks
for
what
's
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
been
wont
to
smile
at
these
annual
vaticinations
of
his
*NL*
mother
's
;
but
this
year
even
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
,
as
he
*NL*
listened
to
an
enumeration
of
the
changes
,
that
the
``
trend
''
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
extravagance
in
dress
--
''
Miss
Jackson
began
.
``
Sillerton
took
me
*NL*
to
the
first
night
of
the
Opera
,
and
I
can
only
tell
you
that
Jane
*NL*
Merry
's
dress
was
the
only
one
I
recognised
from
last
year
;
and
even
*NL*
that
had
had
the
front
panel
changed
.
Yet
I
know
she
got
it
out
from
*NL*
Worth
only
two
years
ago
,
because
my
seamstress
always
goes
in
to
make
*NL*
over
her
Paris
dresses
before
she
wears
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Jane
Merry
is
one
of
US
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
sighing
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
not
such
an
enviable
thing
to
be
in
an
age
when
ladies
were
beginning
*NL*
to
flaunt
abroad
their
Paris
dresses
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
the
*NL*
Custom
House
,
instead
of
letting
them
mellow
under
lock
and
key
,
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
Mrs.
Archer
's
contemporaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
's
one
of
the
few
.
In
my
youth
,
''
Miss
Jackson
rejoined
,
``
it
*NL*
was
considered
vulgar
to
dress
in
the
newest
fashions
;
and
Amy
*NL*
Sillerton
has
always
told
me
that
in
Boston
the
rule
was
to
put
away
*NL*
one
's
Paris
dresses
for
two
years
.
Old
Mrs.
Baxter
Pennilow
,
who
did
*NL*
everything
handsomely
,
used
to
import
twelve
a
year
,
two
velvet
,
two
*NL*
satin
,
two
silk
,
and
the
other
six
of
poplin
and
the
finest
cashmere
.
*NL*
It
was
a
standing
order
,
and
as
she
was
ill
for
two
years
before
she
*NL*
died
they
found
forty-eight
Worth
dresses
that
had
never
been
taken
out
*NL*
of
tissue
paper
;
and
when
the
girls
left
off
their
mourning
they
were
*NL*
able
to
wear
the
first
lot
at
the
Symphony
concerts
without
looking
in
*NL*
advance
of
the
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
Boston
is
more
conservative
than
New
York
;
but
I
always
*NL*
think
it
's
a
safe
rule
for
a
lady
to
lay
aside
her
French
dresses
for
*NL*
one
season
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
conceded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Beaufort
who
started
the
new
fashion
by
making
his
wife
clap
*NL*
her
new
clothes
on
her
back
as
soon
as
they
arrived
:
I
must
say
at
*NL*
times
it
takes
all
Regina
's
distinction
not
to
look
like
...
like
...
''
*NL*
Miss
Jackson
glanced
around
the
table
,
caught
Janey
's
bulging
gaze
,
and
*NL*
took
refuge
in
an
unintelligible
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
her
rivals
,
''
said
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
,
with
the
air
of
*NL*
producing
an
epigram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
--
''
the
ladies
murmured
;
and
Mrs.
Archer
added
,
partly
to
distract
*NL*
her
daughter
's
attention
from
forbidden
topics
:
``
Poor
Regina
!
Her
*NL*
Thanksgiving
has
n't
been
a
very
cheerful
one
,
I
'm
afraid
.
Have
you
*NL*
heard
the
rumours
about
Beaufort
's
speculations
,
Sillerton
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
nodded
carelessly
.
Every
one
had
heard
the
rumours
in
*NL*
question
,
and
he
scorned
to
confirm
a
tale
that
was
already
common
*NL*
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gloomy
silence
fell
upon
the
party
.
No
one
really
liked
Beaufort
,
*NL*
and
it
was
not
wholly
unpleasant
to
think
the
worst
of
his
private
*NL*
life
;
but
the
idea
of
his
having
brought
financial
dishonour
on
his
*NL*
wife
's
family
was
too
shocking
to
be
enjoyed
even
by
his
enemies
.
*NL*
Archer
's
New
York
tolerated
hypocrisy
in
private
relations
;
but
in
*NL*
business
matters
it
exacted
a
limpid
and
impeccable
honesty
.
It
was
a
*NL*
long
time
since
any
well-known
banker
had
failed
discreditably
;
but
*NL*
every
one
remembered
the
social
extinction
visited
on
the
heads
of
the
*NL*
firm
when
the
last
event
of
the
kind
had
happened
.
It
would
be
the
*NL*
same
with
the
Beauforts
,
in
spite
of
his
power
and
her
popularity
;
not
*NL*
all
the
leagued
strength
of
the
Dallas
connection
would
save
poor
*NL*
Regina
if
there
were
any
truth
in
the
reports
of
her
husband
's
unlawful
*NL*
speculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
took
refuge
in
less
ominous
topics
;
but
everything
they
*NL*
touched
on
seemed
to
confirm
Mrs.
Archer
's
sense
of
an
accelerated
*NL*
trend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
Newland
,
I
know
you
let
dear
May
go
to
Mrs.
Struthers
's
*NL*
Sunday
evenings
--
''
she
began
;
and
May
interposed
gaily
:
``
Oh
,
you
know
,
*NL*
everybody
goes
to
Mrs.
Struthers
's
now
;
and
she
was
invited
to
Granny
's
*NL*
last
reception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
,
Archer
reflected
,
that
New
York
managed
its
transitions
:
*NL*
conspiring
to
ignore
them
till
they
were
well
over
,
and
then
,
in
all
*NL*
good
faith
,
imagining
that
they
had
taken
place
in
a
preceding
age
.
*NL*
There
was
always
a
traitor
in
the
citadel
;
and
after
he
-LRB-
or
generally
*NL*
she
-RRB-
had
surrendered
the
keys
,
what
was
the
use
of
pretending
that
it
*NL*
was
impregnable
?
Once
people
had
tasted
of
Mrs.
Struthers
's
easy
*NL*
Sunday
hospitality
they
were
not
likely
to
sit
at
home
remembering
that
*NL*
her
champagne
was
transmuted
Shoe-Polish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
dear
,
I
know
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
sighed
.
``
Such
things
have
to
be
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
as
long
as
AMUSEMENT
is
what
people
go
out
for
;
but
I
've
never
*NL*
quite
forgiven
your
cousin
Madame
Olenska
for
being
the
first
person
to
*NL*
countenance
Mrs.
Struthers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
blush
rose
to
young
Mrs.
Archer
's
face
;
it
surprised
her
*NL*
husband
as
much
as
the
other
guests
about
the
table
.
``
Oh
,
ELLEN
--
''
she
*NL*
murmured
,
much
in
the
same
accusing
and
yet
deprecating
tone
in
which
*NL*
her
parents
might
have
said
:
``
Oh
,
THE
BLENKERS
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
note
which
the
family
had
taken
to
sounding
on
the
mention
*NL*
of
the
Countess
Olenska
's
name
,
since
she
had
surprised
and
*NL*
inconvenienced
them
by
remaining
obdurate
to
her
husband
's
advances
;
*NL*
but
on
May
's
lips
it
gave
food
for
thought
,
and
Archer
looked
at
her
*NL*
with
the
sense
of
strangeness
that
sometimes
came
over
him
when
she
was
*NL*
most
in
the
tone
of
her
environment
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
,
with
less
than
her
usual
sensitiveness
to
atmosphere
,
still
*NL*
insisted
:
``
I
've
always
thought
that
people
like
the
Countess
Olenska
,
*NL*
who
have
lived
in
aristocratic
societies
,
ought
to
help
us
to
keep
up
*NL*
our
social
distinctions
,
instead
of
ignoring
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
May
's
blush
remained
permanently
vivid
:
it
seemed
to
have
a
*NL*
significance
beyond
that
implied
by
the
recognition
of
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
social
bad
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
doubt
we
all
seem
alike
to
foreigners
,
''
said
Miss
Jackson
*NL*
tartly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
Ellen
cares
for
society
;
but
nobody
knows
exactly
what
*NL*
she
does
care
for
,
''
May
continued
,
as
if
she
had
been
groping
for
*NL*
something
noncommittal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
--
''
Mrs.
Archer
sighed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
knew
that
the
Countess
Olenska
was
no
longer
in
the
good
*NL*
graces
of
her
family
.
Even
her
devoted
champion
,
old
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
,
had
been
unable
to
defend
her
refusal
to
return
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
The
Mingotts
had
not
proclaimed
their
disapproval
aloud
:
*NL*
their
sense
of
solidarity
was
too
strong
.
They
had
simply
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Welland
said
,
``
let
poor
Ellen
find
her
own
level
''
--
and
that
,
*NL*
mortifyingly
and
incomprehensibly
,
was
in
the
dim
depths
where
the
*NL*
Blenkers
prevailed
,
and
``
people
who
wrote
''
celebrated
their
untidy
*NL*
rites
.
It
was
incredible
,
but
it
was
a
fact
,
that
Ellen
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
her
opportunities
and
her
privileges
,
had
become
simply
``
Bohemian
.
''
*NL*
The
fact
enforced
the
contention
that
she
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
in
*NL*
not
returning
to
Count
Olenski
.
After
all
,
a
young
woman
's
place
was
*NL*
under
her
husband
's
roof
,
especially
when
she
had
left
it
in
*NL*
circumstances
that
...
well
...
if
one
had
cared
to
look
into
them
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Olenska
is
a
great
favourite
with
the
gentlemen
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Sophy
,
with
her
air
of
wishing
to
put
forth
something
conciliatory
when
*NL*
she
knew
that
she
was
planting
a
dart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
the
danger
that
a
young
woman
like
Madame
Olenska
is
always
*NL*
exposed
to
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
mournfully
agreed
;
and
the
ladies
,
on
this
*NL*
conclusion
,
gathered
up
their
trains
to
seek
the
carcel
globes
of
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
while
Archer
and
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
withdrew
to
the
*NL*
Gothic
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
established
before
the
grate
,
and
consoling
himself
for
the
*NL*
inadequacy
of
the
dinner
by
the
perfection
of
his
cigar
,
Mr.
Jackson
*NL*
became
portentous
and
communicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Beaufort
smash
comes
,
''
he
announced
,
``
there
are
going
to
be
*NL*
disclosures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
raised
his
head
quickly
:
he
could
never
hear
the
name
without
*NL*
the
sharp
vision
of
Beaufort
's
heavy
figure
,
opulently
furred
and
shod
,
*NL*
advancing
through
the
snow
at
Skuytercliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
bound
to
be
,
''
Mr.
Jackson
continued
,
``
the
nastiest
kind
of
a
*NL*
cleaning
up
.
He
has
n't
spent
all
his
money
on
Regina
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
that
's
discounted
,
is
n't
it
?
My
belief
is
he
'll
pull
out
*NL*
yet
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
wanting
to
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
--
perhaps
.
I
know
he
was
to
see
some
of
the
influential
people
*NL*
today
.
Of
course
,
''
Mr.
Jackson
reluctantly
conceded
,
``
it
's
to
be
hoped
*NL*
they
can
tide
him
over
--
this
time
anyhow
.
I
should
n't
like
to
think
of
*NL*
poor
Regina
's
spending
the
rest
of
her
life
in
some
shabby
foreign
*NL*
watering-place
for
bankrupts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
said
nothing
.
It
seemed
to
him
so
natural
--
however
tragic
--
that
*NL*
money
ill-gotten
should
be
cruelly
expiated
,
that
his
mind
,
hardly
*NL*
lingering
over
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
doom
,
wandered
back
to
closer
questions
.
*NL*
What
was
the
meaning
of
May
's
blush
when
the
Countess
Olenska
had
been
*NL*
mentioned
?
*NL*
*NL*
Four
months
had
passed
since
the
midsummer
day
that
he
and
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
had
spent
together
;
and
since
then
he
had
not
seen
her
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
she
had
returned
to
Washington
,
to
the
little
house
which
she
*NL*
and
Medora
Manson
had
taken
there
:
he
had
written
to
her
once
--
a
few
*NL*
words
,
asking
when
they
were
to
meet
again
--
and
she
had
even
more
*NL*
briefly
replied
:
``
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
then
there
had
been
no
farther
communication
between
them
,
and
he
*NL*
had
built
up
within
himself
a
kind
of
sanctuary
in
which
she
throned
*NL*
among
his
secret
thoughts
and
longings
.
Little
by
little
it
became
the
*NL*
scene
of
his
real
life
,
of
his
only
rational
activities
;
thither
he
*NL*
brought
the
books
he
read
,
the
ideas
and
feelings
which
nourished
him
,
*NL*
his
judgments
and
his
visions
.
Outside
it
,
in
the
scene
of
his
actual
*NL*
life
,
he
moved
with
a
growing
sense
of
unreality
and
insufficiency
,
*NL*
blundering
against
familiar
prejudices
and
traditional
points
of
view
*NL*
as
an
absent-minded
man
goes
on
bumping
into
the
furniture
of
his
own
*NL*
room
.
Absent
--
that
was
what
he
was
:
so
absent
from
everything
most
*NL*
densely
real
and
near
to
those
about
him
that
it
sometimes
startled
him
*NL*
to
find
they
still
imagined
he
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
aware
that
Mr.
Jackson
was
clearing
his
throat
preparatory
to
*NL*
farther
revelations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
of
course
,
how
far
your
wife
's
family
are
aware
of
what
*NL*
people
say
about
--
well
,
about
Madame
Olenska
's
refusal
to
accept
her
*NL*
husband
's
latest
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
silent
,
and
Mr.
Jackson
obliquely
continued
:
``
It
's
a
*NL*
pity
--
it
's
certainly
a
pity
--
that
she
refused
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pity
?
In
God
's
name
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
looked
down
his
leg
to
the
unwrinkled
sock
that
joined
it
*NL*
to
a
glossy
pump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
to
put
it
on
the
lowest
ground
--
what
's
she
going
to
live
on
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Beaufort
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sprang
up
,
his
fist
banging
down
on
the
black
walnut-edge
of
the
*NL*
writing-table
.
The
wells
of
the
brass
double-inkstand
danced
in
their
*NL*
sockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jackson
,
shifting
himself
slightly
in
his
chair
,
turned
a
tranquil
*NL*
gaze
on
the
young
man
's
burning
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
have
it
on
pretty
good
authority
--
in
fact
,
on
old
Catherine
's
*NL*
herself
--
that
the
family
reduced
Countess
Olenska
's
allowance
*NL*
considerably
when
she
definitely
refused
to
go
back
to
her
husband
;
and
*NL*
as
,
by
this
refusal
,
she
also
forfeits
the
money
settled
on
her
when
*NL*
she
married
--
which
Olenski
was
ready
to
make
over
to
her
if
she
*NL*
returned
--
why
,
what
the
devil
do
YOU
mean
,
my
dear
boy
,
by
asking
me
*NL*
what
I
mean
?
''
Mr.
Jackson
good-humouredly
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
moved
toward
the
mantelpiece
and
bent
over
to
knock
his
ashes
*NL*
into
the
grate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
of
Madame
Olenska
's
private
affairs
;
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
need
to
,
to
be
certain
that
what
you
insinuate
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
:
it
's
Lefferts
,
for
one
,
''
Mr.
Jackson
interposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lefferts
--
who
made
love
to
her
and
got
snubbed
for
it
!
''
Archer
broke
*NL*
out
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
DID
he
?
''
snapped
the
other
,
as
if
this
were
exactly
the
fact
he
*NL*
had
been
laying
a
trap
for
.
He
still
sat
sideways
from
the
fire
,
so
*NL*
that
his
hard
old
gaze
held
Archer
's
face
as
if
in
a
spring
of
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
:
it
's
a
pity
she
did
n't
go
back
before
Beaufort
's
cropper
,
''
*NL*
he
repeated
.
``
If
she
goes
NOW
,
and
if
he
fails
,
it
will
only
confirm
*NL*
the
general
impression
:
which
is
n't
by
any
means
peculiar
to
Lefferts
,
*NL*
by
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
wo
n't
go
back
now
:
less
than
ever
!
''
Archer
had
no
sooner
said
*NL*
it
than
he
had
once
more
the
feeling
that
it
was
exactly
what
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
had
been
waiting
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
considered
him
attentively
.
``
That
's
your
opinion
,
*NL*
eh
?
Well
,
no
doubt
you
know
.
But
everybody
will
tell
you
that
the
few
*NL*
pennies
Medora
Manson
has
left
are
all
in
Beaufort
's
hands
;
and
how
the
*NL*
two
women
are
to
keep
their
heads
above
water
unless
he
does
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
.
Of
course
,
Madame
Olenska
may
still
soften
old
Catherine
,
*NL*
who
's
been
the
most
inexorably
opposed
to
her
staying
;
and
old
*NL*
Catherine
could
make
her
any
allowance
she
chooses
.
But
we
all
know
*NL*
that
she
hates
parting
with
good
money
;
and
the
rest
of
the
family
have
*NL*
no
particular
interest
in
keeping
Madame
Olenska
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
burning
with
unavailing
wrath
:
he
was
exactly
in
the
state
*NL*
when
a
man
is
sure
to
do
something
stupid
,
knowing
all
the
while
that
*NL*
he
is
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
that
Mr.
Jackson
had
been
instantly
struck
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
's
differences
with
her
grandmother
and
her
other
*NL*
relations
were
not
known
to
him
,
and
that
the
old
gentleman
had
drawn
*NL*
his
own
conclusions
as
to
the
reasons
for
Archer
's
exclusion
from
the
*NL*
family
councils
.
This
fact
warned
Archer
to
go
warily
;
but
the
*NL*
insinuations
about
Beaufort
made
him
reckless
.
He
was
mindful
,
*NL*
however
,
if
not
of
his
own
danger
,
at
least
of
the
fact
that
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
was
under
his
mother
's
roof
,
and
consequently
his
guest
.
Old
*NL*
New
York
scrupulously
observed
the
etiquette
of
hospitality
,
and
no
*NL*
discussion
with
a
guest
was
ever
allowed
to
degenerate
into
a
*NL*
disagreement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
up
and
join
my
mother
?
''
he
suggested
curtly
,
as
Mr.
*NL*
Jackson
's
last
cone
of
ashes
dropped
into
the
brass
ashtray
at
his
*NL*
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
drive
homeward
May
remained
oddly
silent
;
through
the
darkness
,
*NL*
he
still
felt
her
enveloped
in
her
menacing
blush
.
What
its
menace
*NL*
meant
he
could
not
guess
:
but
he
was
sufficiently
warned
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
Madame
Olenska
's
name
had
evoked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
upstairs
,
and
he
turned
into
the
library
.
She
usually
*NL*
followed
him
;
but
he
heard
her
passing
down
the
passage
to
her
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
!
''
he
called
out
impatiently
;
and
she
came
back
,
with
a
slight
*NL*
glance
of
surprise
at
his
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
lamp
is
smoking
again
;
I
should
think
the
servants
might
see
that
*NL*
it
's
kept
properly
trimmed
,
''
he
grumbled
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
sorry
:
it
sha
n't
happen
again
,
''
she
answered
,
in
the
firm
*NL*
bright
tone
she
had
learned
from
her
mother
;
and
it
exasperated
Archer
*NL*
to
feel
that
she
was
already
beginning
to
humour
him
like
a
younger
Mr.
*NL*
Welland
.
She
bent
over
to
lower
the
wick
,
and
as
the
light
struck
up
*NL*
on
her
white
shoulders
and
the
clear
curves
of
her
face
he
thought
:
*NL*
``
How
young
she
is
!
For
what
endless
years
this
life
will
have
to
go
*NL*
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
,
with
a
kind
of
horror
,
his
own
strong
youth
and
the
bounding
*NL*
blood
in
his
veins
.
``
Look
here
,
''
he
said
suddenly
,
``
I
may
have
to
go
*NL*
to
Washington
for
a
few
days
--
soon
;
next
week
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
remained
on
the
key
of
the
lamp
as
she
turned
to
him
slowly
.
*NL*
The
heat
from
its
flame
had
brought
back
a
glow
to
her
face
,
but
it
*NL*
paled
as
she
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
business
?
''
she
asked
,
in
a
tone
which
implied
that
there
could
be
*NL*
no
other
conceivable
reason
,
and
that
she
had
put
the
question
*NL*
automatically
,
as
if
merely
to
finish
his
own
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
business
,
naturally
.
There
's
a
patent
case
coming
up
before
the
*NL*
Supreme
Court
--
''
He
gave
the
name
of
the
inventor
,
and
went
on
*NL*
furnishing
details
with
all
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
practised
glibness
,
*NL*
while
she
listened
attentively
,
saying
at
intervals
:
``
Yes
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
will
do
you
good
,
''
she
said
simply
,
when
he
had
finished
;
*NL*
``
and
you
must
be
sure
to
go
and
see
Ellen
,
''
she
added
,
looking
him
*NL*
straight
in
the
eyes
with
her
cloudless
smile
,
and
speaking
in
the
tone
*NL*
she
might
have
employed
in
urging
him
not
to
neglect
some
irksome
*NL*
family
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
only
word
that
passed
between
them
on
the
subject
;
but
in
*NL*
the
code
in
which
they
had
both
been
trained
it
meant
:
``
Of
course
you
*NL*
understand
that
I
know
all
that
people
have
been
saying
about
Ellen
,
*NL*
and
heartily
sympathise
with
my
family
in
their
effort
to
get
her
to
*NL*
return
to
her
husband
.
I
also
know
that
,
for
some
reason
you
have
not
*NL*
chosen
to
tell
me
,
you
have
advised
her
against
this
course
,
which
all
*NL*
the
older
men
of
the
family
,
as
well
as
our
grandmother
,
agree
in
*NL*
approving
;
and
that
it
is
owing
to
your
encouragement
that
Ellen
defies
*NL*
us
all
,
and
exposes
herself
to
the
kind
of
criticism
of
which
Mr.
*NL*
Sillerton
Jackson
probably
gave
you
,
this
evening
,
the
hint
that
has
*NL*
made
you
so
irritable
...
Hints
have
indeed
not
been
wanting
;
but
*NL*
since
you
appear
unwilling
to
take
them
from
others
,
I
offer
you
this
*NL*
one
myself
,
in
the
only
form
in
which
well-bred
people
of
our
kind
can
*NL*
communicate
unpleasant
things
to
each
other
:
by
letting
you
understand
*NL*
that
I
know
you
mean
to
see
Ellen
when
you
are
in
Washington
,
and
are
*NL*
perhaps
going
there
expressly
for
that
purpose
;
and
that
,
since
you
are
*NL*
sure
to
see
her
,
I
wish
you
to
do
so
with
my
full
and
explicit
*NL*
approval
--
and
to
take
the
opportunity
of
letting
her
know
what
the
*NL*
course
of
conduct
you
have
encouraged
her
in
is
likely
to
lead
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
was
still
on
the
key
of
the
lamp
when
the
last
word
of
this
*NL*
mute
message
reached
him
.
She
turned
the
wick
down
,
lifted
off
the
*NL*
globe
,
and
breathed
on
the
sulky
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
smell
less
if
one
blows
them
out
,
''
she
explained
,
with
her
bright
*NL*
housekeeping
air
.
On
the
threshold
she
turned
and
paused
for
his
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wall
Street
,
the
next
day
,
had
more
reassuring
reports
of
Beaufort
's
*NL*
situation
.
They
were
not
definite
,
but
they
were
hopeful
.
It
was
*NL*
generally
understood
that
he
could
call
on
powerful
influences
in
case
*NL*
of
emergency
,
and
that
he
had
done
so
with
success
;
and
that
evening
,
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Beaufort
appeared
at
the
Opera
wearing
her
old
smile
and
a
*NL*
new
emerald
necklace
,
society
drew
a
breath
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
New
York
was
inexorable
in
its
condemnation
of
business
irregularities
.
*NL*
So
far
there
had
been
no
exception
to
its
tacit
rule
that
those
who
*NL*
broke
the
law
of
probity
must
pay
;
and
every
one
was
aware
that
even
*NL*
Beaufort
and
Beaufort
's
wife
would
be
offered
up
unflinchingly
to
this
*NL*
principle
.
But
to
be
obliged
to
offer
them
up
would
be
not
only
*NL*
painful
but
inconvenient
.
The
disappearance
of
the
Beauforts
would
*NL*
leave
a
considerable
void
in
their
compact
little
circle
;
and
those
who
*NL*
were
too
ignorant
or
too
careless
to
shudder
at
the
moral
catastrophe
*NL*
bewailed
in
advance
the
loss
of
the
best
ball-room
in
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
definitely
made
up
his
mind
to
go
to
Washington
.
He
was
*NL*
waiting
only
for
the
opening
of
the
law-suit
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
*NL*
May
,
so
that
its
date
might
coincide
with
that
of
his
visit
;
but
on
the
*NL*
following
Tuesday
he
learned
from
Mr.
Letterblair
that
the
case
might
*NL*
be
postponed
for
several
weeks
.
Nevertheless
,
he
went
home
that
*NL*
afternoon
determined
in
any
event
to
leave
the
next
evening
.
The
*NL*
chances
were
that
May
,
who
knew
nothing
of
his
professional
life
,
and
*NL*
had
never
shown
any
interest
in
it
,
would
not
learn
of
the
*NL*
postponement
,
should
it
take
place
,
nor
remember
the
names
of
the
*NL*
litigants
if
they
were
mentioned
before
her
;
and
at
any
rate
he
could
*NL*
no
longer
put
off
seeing
Madame
Olenska
.
There
were
too
many
things
*NL*
that
he
must
say
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Wednesday
morning
,
when
he
reached
his
office
,
Mr.
Letterblair
*NL*
met
him
with
a
troubled
face
.
Beaufort
,
after
all
,
had
not
managed
to
*NL*
``
tide
over
''
;
but
by
setting
afloat
the
rumour
that
he
had
done
so
he
*NL*
had
reassured
his
depositors
,
and
heavy
payments
had
poured
into
the
*NL*
bank
till
the
previous
evening
,
when
disturbing
reports
again
began
to
*NL*
predominate
.
In
consequence
,
a
run
on
the
bank
had
begun
,
and
its
*NL*
doors
were
likely
to
close
before
the
day
was
over
.
The
ugliest
things
*NL*
were
being
said
of
Beaufort
's
dastardly
manoeuvre
,
and
his
failure
*NL*
promised
to
be
one
of
the
most
discreditable
in
the
history
of
Wall
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extent
of
the
calamity
left
Mr.
Letterblair
white
and
*NL*
incapacitated
.
``
I
've
seen
bad
things
in
my
time
;
but
nothing
as
bad
as
*NL*
this
.
Everybody
we
know
will
be
hit
,
one
way
or
another
.
And
what
*NL*
will
be
done
about
Mrs.
Beaufort
?
What
CAN
be
done
about
her
?
I
pity
*NL*
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
as
much
as
anybody
:
coming
at
her
age
,
there
's
no
*NL*
knowing
what
effect
this
affair
may
have
on
her
.
She
always
believed
*NL*
in
Beaufort
--
she
made
a
friend
of
him
!
And
there
's
the
whole
Dallas
*NL*
connection
:
poor
Mrs.
Beaufort
is
related
to
every
one
of
you
.
Her
*NL*
only
chance
would
be
to
leave
her
husband
--
yet
how
can
any
one
tell
her
*NL*
so
?
Her
duty
is
at
his
side
;
and
luckily
she
seems
always
to
have
been
*NL*
blind
to
his
private
weaknesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
knock
,
and
Mr.
Letterblair
turned
his
head
sharply
.
``
What
*NL*
is
it
?
I
ca
n't
be
disturbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
clerk
brought
in
a
letter
for
Archer
and
withdrew
.
Recognising
his
*NL*
wife
's
hand
,
the
young
man
opened
the
envelope
and
read
:
``
Wo
n't
you
*NL*
please
come
up
town
as
early
as
you
can
?
Granny
had
a
slight
stroke
*NL*
last
night
.
In
some
mysterious
way
she
found
out
before
any
one
else
*NL*
this
awful
news
about
the
bank
.
Uncle
Lovell
is
away
shooting
,
and
the
*NL*
idea
of
the
disgrace
has
made
poor
Papa
so
nervous
that
he
has
a
*NL*
temperature
and
ca
n't
leave
his
room
.
Mamma
needs
you
dreadfully
,
and
*NL*
I
do
hope
you
can
get
away
at
once
and
go
straight
to
Granny
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
handed
the
note
to
his
senior
partner
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
*NL*
was
crawling
northward
in
a
crowded
horse-car
,
which
he
exchanged
at
*NL*
Fourteenth
Street
for
one
of
the
high
staggering
omnibuses
of
the
Fifth
*NL*
Avenue
line
.
It
was
after
twelve
o'clock
when
this
laborious
vehicle
*NL*
dropped
him
at
old
Catherine
's
.
The
sitting-room
window
on
the
ground
*NL*
floor
,
where
she
usually
throned
,
was
tenanted
by
the
inadequate
figure
*NL*
of
her
daughter
,
Mrs.
Welland
,
who
signed
a
haggard
welcome
as
she
*NL*
caught
sight
of
Archer
;
and
at
the
door
he
was
met
by
May
.
The
hall
*NL*
wore
the
unnatural
appearance
peculiar
to
well-kept
houses
suddenly
*NL*
invaded
by
illness
:
wraps
and
furs
lay
in
heaps
on
the
chairs
,
a
*NL*
doctor
's
bag
and
overcoat
were
on
the
table
,
and
beside
them
letters
*NL*
and
cards
had
already
piled
up
unheeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
looked
pale
but
smiling
:
Dr.
Bencomb
,
who
had
just
come
for
the
*NL*
second
time
,
took
a
more
hopeful
view
,
and
Mrs.
Mingott
's
dauntless
*NL*
determination
to
live
and
get
well
was
already
having
an
effect
on
her
*NL*
family
.
May
led
Archer
into
the
old
lady
's
sitting-room
,
where
the
*NL*
sliding
doors
opening
into
the
bedroom
had
been
drawn
shut
,
and
the
*NL*
heavy
yellow
damask
portieres
dropped
over
them
;
and
here
Mrs.
Welland
*NL*
communicated
to
him
in
horrified
undertones
the
details
of
the
*NL*
catastrophe
.
It
appeared
that
the
evening
before
something
dreadful
*NL*
and
mysterious
had
happened
.
At
about
eight
o'clock
,
just
after
Mrs.
*NL*
Mingott
had
finished
the
game
of
solitaire
that
she
always
played
after
*NL*
dinner
,
the
door-bell
had
rung
,
and
a
lady
so
thickly
veiled
that
the
*NL*
servants
did
not
immediately
recognise
her
had
asked
to
be
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
butler
,
hearing
a
familiar
voice
,
had
thrown
open
the
sitting-room
*NL*
door
,
announcing
:
``
Mrs.
Julius
Beaufort
''
--
and
had
then
closed
it
again
*NL*
on
the
two
ladies
.
They
must
have
been
together
,
he
thought
,
about
an
*NL*
hour
.
When
Mrs.
Mingott
's
bell
rang
Mrs.
Beaufort
had
already
slipped
*NL*
away
unseen
,
and
the
old
lady
,
white
and
vast
and
terrible
,
sat
alone
*NL*
in
her
great
chair
,
and
signed
to
the
butler
to
help
her
into
her
room
.
*NL*
She
seemed
,
at
that
time
,
though
obviously
distressed
,
in
complete
*NL*
control
of
her
body
and
brain
.
The
mulatto
maid
put
her
to
bed
,
*NL*
brought
her
a
cup
of
tea
as
usual
,
laid
everything
straight
in
the
*NL*
room
,
and
went
away
;
but
at
three
in
the
morning
the
bell
rang
again
,
*NL*
and
the
two
servants
,
hastening
in
at
this
unwonted
summons
-LRB-
for
old
*NL*
Catherine
usually
slept
like
a
baby
-RRB-
,
had
found
their
mistress
sitting
*NL*
up
against
her
pillows
with
a
crooked
smile
on
her
face
and
one
little
*NL*
hand
hanging
limp
from
its
huge
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stroke
had
clearly
been
a
slight
one
,
for
she
was
able
to
*NL*
articulate
and
to
make
her
wishes
known
;
and
soon
after
the
doctor
's
*NL*
first
visit
she
had
begun
to
regain
control
of
her
facial
muscles
.
But
*NL*
the
alarm
had
been
great
;
and
proportionately
great
was
the
indignation
*NL*
when
it
was
gathered
from
Mrs.
Mingott
's
fragmentary
phrases
that
*NL*
Regina
Beaufort
had
come
to
ask
her
--
incredible
effrontery
!
--
to
back
up
*NL*
her
husband
,
see
them
through
--
not
to
``
desert
''
them
,
as
she
called
*NL*
it
--
in
fact
to
induce
the
whole
family
to
cover
and
condone
their
*NL*
monstrous
dishonour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
her
:
`
Honour
's
always
been
honour
,
and
honesty
honesty
,
in
*NL*
Manson
Mingott
's
house
,
and
will
be
till
I
'm
carried
out
of
it
feet
*NL*
first
,
'
''
the
old
woman
had
stammered
into
her
daughter
's
ear
,
in
the
*NL*
thick
voice
of
the
partly
paralysed
.
``
And
when
she
said
:
`
But
my
*NL*
name
,
Auntie
--
my
name
's
Regina
Dallas
,
'
I
said
:
`
It
was
Beaufort
when
*NL*
he
covered
you
with
jewels
,
and
it
's
got
to
stay
Beaufort
now
that
he
's
*NL*
covered
you
with
shame
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
,
with
tears
and
gasps
of
horror
,
Mrs.
Welland
imparted
,
*NL*
blanched
and
demolished
by
the
unwonted
obligation
of
having
at
last
to
*NL*
fix
her
eyes
on
the
unpleasant
and
the
discreditable
.
``
If
only
I
could
*NL*
keep
it
from
your
father-in-law
:
he
always
says
:
`
Augusta
,
for
pity
's
*NL*
sake
,
do
n't
destroy
my
last
illusions
'
--
and
how
am
I
to
prevent
his
*NL*
knowing
these
horrors
?
''
the
poor
lady
wailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
Mamma
,
he
wo
n't
have
SEEN
them
,
''
her
daughter
suggested
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Welland
sighed
:
``
Ah
,
no
;
thank
heaven
he
's
safe
in
bed
.
And
*NL*
Dr.
Bencomb
has
promised
to
keep
him
there
till
poor
Mamma
is
better
,
*NL*
and
Regina
has
been
got
away
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
seated
himself
near
the
window
and
was
gazing
out
blankly
at
*NL*
the
deserted
thoroughfare
.
It
was
evident
that
he
had
been
summoned
*NL*
rather
for
the
moral
support
of
the
stricken
ladies
than
because
of
any
*NL*
specific
aid
that
he
could
render
.
Mr.
Lovell
Mingott
had
been
*NL*
telegraphed
for
,
and
messages
were
being
despatched
by
hand
to
the
*NL*
members
of
the
family
living
in
New
York
;
and
meanwhile
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
to
discuss
in
hushed
tones
the
consequences
of
*NL*
Beaufort
's
dishonour
and
of
his
wife
's
unjustifiable
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
,
who
had
been
in
another
room
writing
notes
,
*NL*
presently
reappeared
,
and
added
her
voice
to
the
discussion
.
In
THEIR
*NL*
day
,
the
elder
ladies
agreed
,
the
wife
of
a
man
who
had
done
anything
*NL*
disgraceful
in
business
had
only
one
idea
:
to
efface
herself
,
to
*NL*
disappear
with
him
.
``
There
was
the
case
of
poor
Grandmamma
Spicer
;
*NL*
your
great-grandmother
,
May
.
Of
course
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
hastened
to
add
,
*NL*
``
your
great-grandfather
's
money
difficulties
were
private
--
losses
at
*NL*
cards
,
or
signing
a
note
for
somebody
--
I
never
quite
knew
,
because
*NL*
Mamma
would
never
speak
of
it
.
But
she
was
brought
up
in
the
country
*NL*
because
her
mother
had
to
leave
New
York
after
the
disgrace
,
whatever
*NL*
it
was
:
they
lived
up
the
Hudson
alone
,
winter
and
summer
,
till
Mamma
*NL*
was
sixteen
.
It
would
never
have
occurred
to
Grandmamma
Spicer
to
ask
*NL*
the
family
to
`
countenance
'
her
,
as
I
understand
Regina
calls
it
;
*NL*
though
a
private
disgrace
is
nothing
compared
to
the
scandal
of
ruining
*NL*
hundreds
of
innocent
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
would
be
more
becoming
in
Regina
to
hide
her
own
countenance
*NL*
than
to
talk
about
other
people
's
,
''
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
agreed
.
``
I
*NL*
understand
that
the
emerald
necklace
she
wore
at
the
Opera
last
Friday
*NL*
had
been
sent
on
approval
from
Ball
and
Black
's
in
the
afternoon
.
I
*NL*
wonder
if
they
'll
ever
get
it
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
listened
unmoved
to
the
relentless
chorus
.
The
idea
of
absolute
*NL*
financial
probity
as
the
first
law
of
a
gentleman
's
code
was
too
deeply
*NL*
ingrained
in
him
for
sentimental
considerations
to
weaken
it
.
An
*NL*
adventurer
like
Lemuel
Struthers
might
build
up
the
millions
of
his
*NL*
Shoe
Polish
on
any
number
of
shady
dealings
;
but
unblemished
honesty
*NL*
was
the
noblesse
oblige
of
old
financial
New
York
.
Nor
did
Mrs.
*NL*
Beaufort
's
fate
greatly
move
Archer
.
He
felt
,
no
doubt
,
more
sorry
for
*NL*
her
than
her
indignant
relatives
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
tie
*NL*
between
husband
and
wife
,
even
if
breakable
in
prosperity
,
should
be
*NL*
indissoluble
in
misfortune
.
As
Mr.
Letterblair
had
said
,
a
wife
's
*NL*
place
was
at
her
husband
's
side
when
he
was
in
trouble
;
but
society
's
*NL*
place
was
not
at
his
side
,
and
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
cool
assumption
that
it
*NL*
was
seemed
almost
to
make
her
his
accomplice
.
The
mere
idea
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
appealing
to
her
family
to
screen
her
husband
's
business
*NL*
dishonour
was
inadmissible
,
since
it
was
the
one
thing
that
the
Family
,
*NL*
as
an
institution
,
could
not
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mulatto
maid
called
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
into
the
hall
,
and
the
*NL*
latter
came
back
in
a
moment
with
a
frowning
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wants
me
to
telegraph
for
Ellen
Olenska
.
I
had
written
to
Ellen
,
*NL*
of
course
,
and
to
Medora
;
but
now
it
seems
that
's
not
enough
.
I
'm
to
*NL*
telegraph
to
her
immediately
,
and
to
tell
her
that
she
's
to
come
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
announcement
was
received
in
silence
.
Mrs.
Welland
sighed
*NL*
resignedly
,
and
May
rose
from
her
seat
and
went
to
gather
up
some
*NL*
newspapers
that
had
been
scattered
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
must
be
done
,
''
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
continued
,
as
if
*NL*
hoping
to
be
contradicted
;
and
May
turned
back
toward
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
must
be
done
,
''
she
said
.
``
Granny
knows
what
she
wants
,
*NL*
and
we
must
carry
out
all
her
wishes
.
Shall
I
write
the
telegram
for
*NL*
you
,
Auntie
?
If
it
goes
at
once
Ellen
can
probably
catch
tomorrow
*NL*
morning
's
train
.
''
She
pronounced
the
syllables
of
the
name
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
clearness
,
as
if
she
had
tapped
on
two
silver
bells
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ca
n't
go
at
once
.
Jasper
and
the
pantry-boy
are
both
out
*NL*
with
notes
and
telegrams
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
May
turned
to
her
husband
with
a
smile
.
``
But
here
's
Newland
,
ready
to
*NL*
do
anything
.
Will
you
take
the
telegram
,
Newland
?
There
'll
be
just
*NL*
time
before
luncheon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
rose
with
a
murmur
of
readiness
,
and
she
seated
herself
at
old
*NL*
Catherine
's
rosewood
``
Bonheur
du
Jour
,
''
and
wrote
out
the
message
in
*NL*
her
large
immature
hand
.
When
it
was
written
she
blotted
it
neatly
and
*NL*
handed
it
to
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
and
Ellen
will
cross
each
other
on
*NL*
the

''
she
added
,
turning
to
her
mother
and
aunt
,
``
is
*NL*
obliged
to
go
to
Washington
about
a
patent
law-suit
that
is
coming
up
*NL*
before
the
Supreme
Court
.
I
suppose
Uncle
Lovell
will
be
back
by
*NL*
tomorrow
night
,
and
with
Granny
improving
so
much
it
does
n't
seem
right
*NL*
to
ask
Newland
to
give
up
an
important
engagement
for
the
firm
--
does
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
as
if
for
an
answer
,
and
Mrs.
Welland
hastily
declared
:
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
not
,
darling
.
Your
Granny
would
be
the
last
person
to
*NL*
wish
it
.
''
As
Archer
left
the
room
with
the
telegram
,
he
heard
his
*NL*
mother-in-law
add
,
presumably
to
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
:
``
But
why
on
*NL*
earth
she
should
make
you
telegraph
for
Ellen
Olenska
--
''
and
May
's
*NL*
clear
voice
rejoin
:
``
Perhaps
it
's
to
urge
on
her
again
that
after
all
*NL*
her
duty
is
with
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
outer
door
closed
on
Archer
and
he
walked
hastily
away
toward
the
*NL*
telegraph
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ol-ol
--
howjer
spell
it
,
anyhow
?
''
asked
the
tart
young
lady
to
whom
*NL*
Archer
had
pushed
his
wife
's
telegram
across
the
brass
ledge
of
the
*NL*
Western
Union
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Olenska
--
O-len-ska
,
''
he
repeated
,
drawing
back
the
message
in
order
to
*NL*
print
out
the
foreign
syllables
above
May
's
rambling
script
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
unlikely
name
for
a
New
York
telegraph
office
;
at
least
in
*NL*
this
quarter
,
''
an
unexpected
voice
observed
;
and
turning
around
Archer
*NL*
saw
Lawrence
Lefferts
at
his
elbow
,
pulling
an
imperturbable
moustache
*NL*
and
affecting
not
to
glance
at
the
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
Newland
:
thought
I
'd
catch
you
here
.
I
've
just
heard
of
old
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
's
stroke
;
and
as
I
was
on
my
way
to
the
house
I
saw
you
*NL*
turning
down
this
street
and
nipped
after
you
.
I
suppose
you
've
come
*NL*
from
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
nodded
,
and
pushed
his
telegram
under
the
lattice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
bad
,
eh
?
''
Lefferts
continued
.
``
Wiring
to
the
family
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
I
gather
it
IS
bad
,
if
you
're
including
Countess
Olenska
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
lips
stiffened
;
he
felt
a
savage
impulse
to
dash
his
fist
into
*NL*
the
long
vain
handsome
face
at
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lefferts
,
who
was
known
to
shrink
from
discussion
,
raised
his
eye-brows
*NL*
with
an
ironic
grimace
that
warned
the
other
of
the
watching
damsel
*NL*
behind
the
lattice
.
Nothing
could
be
worse
``
form
''
the
look
reminded
*NL*
Archer
,
than
any
display
of
temper
in
a
public
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
never
been
more
indifferent
to
the
requirements
of
form
;
but
*NL*
his
impulse
to
do
Lawrence
Lefferts
a
physical
injury
was
only
*NL*
momentary
.
The
idea
of
bandying
Ellen
Olenska
's
name
with
him
at
such
*NL*
a
time
,
and
on
whatsoever
provocation
,
was
unthinkable
.
He
paid
for
*NL*
his
telegram
,
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
together
into
the
street
.
*NL*
There
Archer
,
having
regained
his
self-control
,
went
on
:
``
Mrs.
Mingott
*NL*
is
much
better
:
the
doctor
feels
no
anxiety
whatever
''
;
and
Lefferts
,
*NL*
with
profuse
expressions
of
relief
,
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
that
*NL*
there
were
beastly
bad
rumours
again
about
Beaufort
...
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
the
announcement
of
the
Beaufort
failure
was
in
all
the
*NL*
papers
.
It
overshadowed
the
report
of
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
stroke
,
*NL*
and
only
the
few
who
had
heard
of
the
mysterious
connection
between
the
*NL*
two
events
thought
of
ascribing
old
Catherine
's
illness
to
anything
but
*NL*
the
accumulation
of
flesh
and
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
New
York
was
darkened
by
the
tale
of
Beaufort
's
dishonour
.
*NL*
There
had
never
,
as
Mr.
Letterblair
said
,
been
a
worse
case
in
his
*NL*
memory
,
nor
,
for
that
matter
,
in
the
memory
of
the
far-off
Letterblair
*NL*
who
had
given
his
name
to
the
firm
.
The
bank
had
continued
to
take
in
*NL*
money
for
a
whole
day
after
its
failure
was
inevitable
;
and
as
many
of
*NL*
its
clients
belonged
to
one
or
another
of
the
ruling
clans
,
Beaufort
's
*NL*
duplicity
seemed
doubly
cynical
.
If
Mrs.
Beaufort
had
not
taken
the
*NL*
tone
that
such
misfortunes
-LRB-
the
word
was
her
own
-RRB-
were
``
the
test
of
*NL*
friendship
,
''
compassion
for
her
might
have
tempered
the
general
*NL*
indignation
against
her
husband
.
As
it
was
--
and
especially
after
the
*NL*
object
of
her
nocturnal
visit
to
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
had
become
*NL*
known
--
her
cynicism
was
held
to
exceed
his
;
and
she
had
not
the
*NL*
excuse
--
nor
her
detractors
the
satisfaction
--
of
pleading
that
she
was
*NL*
``
a
foreigner
.
''
It
was
some
comfort
-LRB-
to
those
whose
securities
were
not
*NL*
in
jeopardy
-RRB-
to
be
able
to
remind
themselves
that
Beaufort
WAS
;
but
,
*NL*
after
all
,
if
a
Dallas
of
South
Carolina
took
his
view
of
the
case
,
and
*NL*
glibly
talked
of
his
soon
being
``
on
his
feet
again
,
''
the
argument
lost
*NL*
its
edge
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
accept
this
awful
evidence
*NL*
of
the
indissolubility
of
marriage
.
Society
must
manage
to
get
on
*NL*
without
the
Beauforts
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
--
except
indeed
for
*NL*
such
hapless
victims
of
the
disaster
as
Medora
Manson
,
the
poor
old
*NL*
Miss
Lannings
,
and
certain
other
misguided
ladies
of
good
family
who
,
*NL*
if
only
they
had
listened
to
Mr.
Henry
van
der
Luyden
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
thing
the
Beauforts
can
do
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
,
summing
it
up
*NL*
as
if
she
were
pronouncing
a
diagnosis
and
prescribing
a
course
of
*NL*
treatment
,
``
is
to
go
and
live
at
Regina
's
little
place
in
North
*NL*
Carolina
.
Beaufort
has
always
kept
a
racing
stable
,
and
he
had
better
*NL*
breed
trotting
horses
.
I
should
say
he
had
all
the
qualities
of
a
*NL*
successful
horsedealer
.
''
Every
one
agreed
with
her
,
but
no
one
*NL*
condescended
to
enquire
what
the
Beauforts
really
meant
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
was
much
better
:
she
recovered
her
*NL*
voice
sufficiently
to
give
orders
that
no
one
should
mention
the
*NL*
Beauforts
to
her
again
,
and
asked
--
when
Dr.
Bencomb
appeared
--
what
in
*NL*
the
world
her
family
meant
by
making
such
a
fuss
about
her
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
people
of
my
age
WILL
eat
chicken-salad
in
the
evening
what
are
*NL*
they
to
expect
?
''
she
enquired
;
and
,
the
doctor
having
opportunely
*NL*
modified
her
dietary
,
the
stroke
was
transformed
into
an
attack
of
*NL*
indigestion
.
But
in
spite
of
her
firm
tone
old
Catherine
did
not
*NL*
wholly
recover
her
former
attitude
toward
life
.
The
growing
remoteness
*NL*
of
old
age
,
though
it
had
not
diminished
her
curiosity
about
her
*NL*
neighbours
,
had
blunted
her
never
very
lively
compassion
for
their
*NL*
troubles
;
and
she
seemed
to
have
no
difficulty
in
putting
the
Beaufort
*NL*
disaster
out
of
her
mind
.
But
for
the
first
time
she
became
absorbed
*NL*
in
her
own
symptoms
,
and
began
to
take
a
sentimental
interest
in
*NL*
certain
members
of
her
family
to
whom
she
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
contemptuously
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Welland
,
in
particular
,
had
the
privilege
of
attracting
her
notice
.
*NL*
Of
her
sons-in-law
he
was
the
one
she
had
most
consistently
ignored
;
*NL*
and
all
his
wife
's
efforts
to
represent
him
as
a
man
of
forceful
*NL*
character
and
marked
intellectual
ability
-LRB-
if
he
had
only
``
chosen
''
-RRB-
had
*NL*
been
met
with
a
derisive
chuckle
.
But
his
eminence
as
a
valetudinarian
*NL*
now
made
him
an
object
of
engrossing
interest
,
and
Mrs.
Mingott
issued
*NL*
an
imperial
summons
to
him
to
come
and
compare
diets
as
soon
as
his
*NL*
temperature
permitted
;
for
old
Catherine
was
now
the
first
to
recognise
*NL*
that
one
could
not
be
too
careful
about
temperatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty-four
hours
after
Madame
Olenska
's
summons
a
telegram
announced
*NL*
that
she
would
arrive
from
Washington
on
the
evening
of
the
following
*NL*
day
.
At
the
Wellands
'
,
where
the
Newland
Archers
chanced
to
be
*NL*
lunching
,
the
question
as
to
who
should
meet
her
at
Jersey
City
was
*NL*
immediately
raised
;
and
the
material
difficulties
amid
which
the
*NL*
Welland
household
struggled
as
if
it
had
been
a
frontier
outpost
,
lent
*NL*
animation
to
the
debate
.
It
was
agreed
that
Mrs.
Welland
could
not
*NL*
possibly
go
to
Jersey
City
because
she
was
to
accompany
her
husband
to
*NL*
old
Catherine
's
that
afternoon
,
and
the
brougham
could
not
be
spared
,
*NL*
since
,
if
Mr.
Welland
were
``
upset
''
by
seeing
his
mother-in-law
for
the
*NL*
first
time
after
her
attack
,
he
might
have
to
be
taken
home
at
a
*NL*
moment
's
notice
.
The
Welland
sons
would
of
course
be
``
down
town
,
''
Mr.
*NL*
Lovell
Mingott
would
be
just
hurrying
back
from
his
shooting
,
and
the
*NL*
Mingott
carriage
engaged
in
meeting
him
;
and
one
could
not
ask
May
,
at
*NL*
the
close
of
a
winter
afternoon
,
to
go
alone
across
the
ferry
to
Jersey
*NL*
City
,
even
in
her
own
carriage
.
Nevertheless
,
it
might
appear
*NL*
inhospitable
--
and
contrary
to
old
Catherine
's
express
wishes
--
if
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
were
allowed
to
arrive
without
any
of
the
family
being
at
the
*NL*
station
to
receive
her
.
It
was
just
like
Ellen
,
Mrs.
Welland
's
tired
*NL*
voice
implied
,
to
place
the
family
in
such
a
dilemma
.
``
It
's
always
one
*NL*
thing
after
another
,
''
the
poor
lady
grieved
,
in
one
of
her
rare
revolts
*NL*
against
fate
;
``
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
think
Mamma
must
be
less
*NL*
well
than
Dr.
Bencomb
will
admit
is
this
morbid
desire
to
have
Ellen
*NL*
come
at
once
,
however
inconvenient
it
is
to
meet
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
had
been
thoughtless
,
as
the
utterances
of
impatience
often
*NL*
are
;
and
Mr.
Welland
was
upon
them
with
a
pounce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Augusta
,
''
he
said
,
turning
pale
and
laying
down
his
fork
,
``
have
you
*NL*
any
other
reason
for
thinking
that
Bencomb
is
less
to
be
relied
on
than
*NL*
he
was
?
Have
you
noticed
that
he
has
been
less
conscientious
than
*NL*
usual
in
following
up
my
case
or
your
mother
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mrs.
Welland
's
turn
to
grow
pale
as
the
endless
consequences
of
*NL*
her
blunder
unrolled
themselves
before
her
;
but
she
managed
to
laugh
,
*NL*
and
take
a
second
helping
of
scalloped
oysters
,
before
she
said
,
*NL*
struggling
back
into
her
old
armour
of
cheerfulness
:
``
My
dear
,
how
*NL*
could
you
imagine
such
a
thing
?
I
only
meant
that
,
after
the
decided
*NL*
stand
Mamma
took
about
its
being
Ellen
's
duty
to
go
back
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
it
seems
strange
that
she
should
be
seized
with
this
sudden
*NL*
whim
to
see
her
,
when
there
are
half
a
dozen
other
grandchildren
that
*NL*
she
might
have
asked
for
.
But
we
must
never
forget
that
Mamma
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
wonderful
vitality
,
is
a
very
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Welland
's
brow
remained
clouded
,
and
it
was
evident
that
his
*NL*
perturbed
imagination
had
fastened
at
once
on
this
last
remark
.
``
Yes
:
*NL*
your
mother
's
a
very
old
woman
;
and
for
all
we
know
Bencomb
may
not
be
*NL*
as
successful
with
very
old
people
.
As
you
say
,
my
dear
,
it
's
always
*NL*
one
thing
after
another
;
and
in
another
ten
or
fifteen
years
I
suppose
*NL*
I
shall
have
the
pleasing
duty
of
looking
about
for
a
new
doctor
.
It
's
*NL*
always
better
to
make
such
a
change
before
it
's
absolutely
necessary
.
''
*NL*
And
having
arrived
at
this
Spartan
decision
Mr.
Welland
firmly
took
up
*NL*
his
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
the
while
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
began
again
,
as
she
rose
from
the
*NL*
luncheon-table
,
and
led
the
way
into
the
wilderness
of
purple
satin
and
*NL*
malachite
known
as
the
back
drawing-room
,
``
I
do
n't
see
how
Ellen
's
to
*NL*
be
got
here
tomorrow
evening
;
and
I
do
like
to
have
things
settled
for
*NL*
at
least
twenty-four
hours
ahead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
turned
from
the
fascinated
contemplation
of
a
small
painting
*NL*
representing
two
Cardinals
carousing
,
in
an
octagonal
ebony
frame
set
*NL*
with
medallions
of
onyx
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
fetch
her
?
''
he
proposed
.
``
I
can
easily
get
away
from
the
*NL*
office
in
time
to
meet
the
brougham
at
the
ferry
,
if
May
will
send
it
*NL*
there
.
''
His
heart
was
beating
excitedly
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
heaved
a
sigh
of
gratitude
,
and
May
,
who
had
moved
away
to
*NL*
the
window
,
turned
to
shed
on
him
a
beam
of
approval
.
``
So
you
see
,
*NL*
Mamma
,
everything
WILL
be
settled
twenty-four
hours
in
advance
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
stooping
over
to
kiss
her
mother
's
troubled
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
's
brougham
awaited
her
at
the
door
,
and
she
was
to
drive
Archer
to
*NL*
Union
Square
,
where
he
could
pick
up
a
Broadway
car
to
carry
him
to
the
*NL*
office
.
As
she
settled
herself
in
her
corner
she
said
:
``
I
did
n't
want
*NL*
to
worry
Mamma
by
raising
fresh
obstacles
;
but
how
can
you
meet
Ellen
*NL*
tomorrow
,
and
bring
her
back
to
New
York
,
when
you
're
going
to
*NL*
Washington
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
going
,
''
Archer
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
going
?
Why
,
what
's
happened
?
''
Her
voice
was
as
clear
as
a
bell
,
*NL*
and
full
of
wifely
solicitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
case
is
off
--
postponed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Postponed
?
How
odd
!
I
saw
a
note
this
morning
from
Mr.
Letterblair
*NL*
to
Mamma
saying
that
he
was
going
to
Washington
tomorrow
for
the
big
*NL*
patent
case
that
he
was
to
argue
before
the
Supreme
Court
.
You
said
it
*NL*
was
a
patent
case
,
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
that
's
it
:
the
whole
office
ca
n't
go
.
Letterblair
decided
to
go
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
NOT
postponed
?
''
she
continued
,
with
an
insistence
so
unlike
*NL*
her
that
he
felt
the
blood
rising
to
his
face
,
as
if
he
were
blushing
*NL*
for
her
unwonted
lapse
from
all
the
traditional
delicacies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
but
my
going
is
,
''
he
answered
,
cursing
the
unnecessary
*NL*
explanations
that
he
had
given
when
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
*NL*
going
to
Washington
,
and
wondering
where
he
had
read
that
clever
liars
*NL*
give
details
,
but
that
the
cleverest
do
not
.
It
did
not
hurt
him
half
*NL*
as
much
to
tell
May
an
untruth
as
to
see
her
trying
to
pretend
that
she
*NL*
had
not
detected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
till
later
on
:
luckily
for
the
convenience
of
your
*NL*
family
,
''
he
continued
,
taking
base
refuge
in
sarcasm
.
As
he
spoke
he
*NL*
felt
that
she
was
looking
at
him
,
and
he
turned
his
eyes
to
hers
in
*NL*
order
not
to
appear
to
be
avoiding
them
.
Their
glances
met
for
a
*NL*
second
,
and
perhaps
let
them
into
each
other
's
meanings
more
deeply
*NL*
than
either
cared
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
IS
awfully
convenient
,
''
May
brightly
agreed
,
``
that
you
should
*NL*
be
able
to
meet
Ellen
after
all
;
you
saw
how
much
Mamma
appreciated
*NL*
your
offering
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
delighted
to
do
it
.
''
The
carriage
stopped
,
and
as
he
jumped
*NL*
out
she
leaned
to
him
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
.
``
Good-bye
,
dearest
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
her
eyes
so
blue
that
he
wondered
afterward
if
they
had
shone
*NL*
on
him
through
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
and
hurried
across
Union
Square
,
repeating
to
himself
,
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
inward
chant
:
``
It
's
all
of
two
hours
from
Jersey
City
to
*NL*
old
Catherine
's
.
It
's
all
of
two
hours
--
and
it
may
be
more
.

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
's
dark
blue
brougham
-LRB-
with
the
wedding
varnish
still
on
it
-RRB-
*NL*
met
Archer
at
the
ferry
,
and
conveyed
him
luxuriously
to
the
*NL*
Pennsylvania
terminus
in
Jersey
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
sombre
snowy
afternoon
,
and
the
gas-lamps
were
lit
in
the
big
*NL*
reverberating
station
.
As
he
paced
the
platform
,
waiting
for
the
*NL*
Washington
express
,
he
remembered
that
there
were
people
who
thought
*NL*
there
would
one
day
be
a
tunnel
under
the
Hudson
through
which
the
*NL*
trains
of
the
Pennsylvania
railway
would
run
straight
into
New
York
.
*NL*
They
were
of
the
brotherhood
of
visionaries
who
likewise
predicted
the
*NL*
building
of
ships
that
would
cross
the
Atlantic
in
five
days
,
the
*NL*
invention
of
a
flying
machine
,
lighting
by
electricity
,
telephonic
*NL*
communication
without
wires
,
and
other
Arabian
Night
marvels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
which
of
their
visions
comes
true
,
''
Archer
mused
,
``
as
*NL*
long
as
the
tunnel
is
n't
built
yet
.
''
In
his
senseless
school-boy
*NL*
happiness
he
pictured
Madame
Olenska
's
descent
from
the
train
,
his
*NL*
discovery
of
her
a
long
way
off
,
among
the
throngs
of
meaningless
*NL*
faces
,
her
clinging
to
his
arm
as
he
guided
her
to
the
carriage
,
their
*NL*
slow
approach
to
the
wharf
among
slipping
horses
,
laden
carts
,
*NL*
vociferating
teamsters
,
and
then
the
startling
quiet
of
the
ferry-boat
,
*NL*
where
they
would
sit
side
by
side
under
the
snow
,
in
the
motionless
*NL*
carriage
,
while
the
earth
seemed
to
glide
away
under
them
,
rolling
to
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
sun
.
It
was
incredible
,
the
number
of
things
he
*NL*
had
to
say
to
her
,
and
in
what
eloquent
order
they
were
forming
*NL*
themselves
on
his
lips
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
clanging
and
groaning
of
the
train
came
nearer
,
and
it
staggered
*NL*
slowly
into
the
station
like
a
prey-laden
monster
into
its
lair
.
*NL*
Archer
pushed
forward
,
elbowing
through
the
crowd
,
and
staring
blindly
*NL*
into
window
after
window
of
the
high-hung
carriages
.
And
then
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
he
saw
Madame
Olenska
's
pale
and
surprised
face
close
at
*NL*
hand
,
and
had
again
the
mortified
sensation
of
having
forgotten
what
*NL*
she
looked
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
each
other
,
their
hands
met
,
and
he
drew
her
arm
through
*NL*
his
.
``
This
way
--
I
have
the
carriage
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
it
all
happened
as
he
had
dreamed
.
He
helped
her
into
the
*NL*
brougham
with
her
bags
,
and
had
afterward
the
vague
recollection
of
*NL*
having
properly
reassured
her
about
her
grandmother
and
given
her
a
*NL*
summary
of
the
Beaufort
situation
-LRB-
he
was
struck
by
the
softness
of
*NL*
her
:
``
Poor
Regina
!
''
-RRB-
.
Meanwhile
the
carriage
had
worked
its
way
out
*NL*
of
the
coil
about
the
station
,
and
they
were
crawling
down
the
slippery
*NL*
incline
to
the
wharf
,
menaced
by
swaying
coal-carts
,
bewildered
horses
,
*NL*
dishevelled
express-wagons
,
and
an
empty
hearse
--
ah
,
that
hearse
!
She
*NL*
shut
her
eyes
as
it
passed
,
and
clutched
at
Archer
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
it
does
n't
mean
--
poor
Granny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
no
--
she
's
much
better
--
she
's
all
right
,
really
.
There
--
we
've
*NL*
passed
it
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
as
if
that
made
all
the
difference
.
Her
hand
*NL*
remained
in
his
,
and
as
the
carriage
lurched
across
the
gang-plank
onto
*NL*
the
ferry
he
bent
over
,
unbuttoned
her
tight
brown
glove
,
and
kissed
*NL*
her
palm
as
if
he
had
kissed
a
relic
.
She
disengaged
herself
with
a
*NL*
faint
smile
,
and
he
said
:
``
You
did
n't
expect
me
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
go
to
Washington
to
see
you
.
I
'd
made
all
my
*NL*
arrangements
--
I
very
nearly
crossed
you
in
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
''
she
exclaimed
,
as
if
terrified
by
the
narrowness
of
their
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
--
I
hardly
remembered
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
remembered
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
:
how
shall
I
explain
?
I
--
it
's
always
so
.
EACH
TIME
YOU
HAPPEN
*NL*
TO
ME
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
:
I
know
!
I
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
--
do
I
too
:
to
you
?
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
,
looking
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
--
Ellen
--
Ellen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
,
and
he
sat
in
silence
,
watching
her
profile
grow
*NL*
indistinct
against
the
snow-streaked
dusk
beyond
the
window
.
What
had
*NL*
she
been
doing
in
all
those
four
long
months
,
he
wondered
?
How
little
*NL*
they
knew
of
each
other
,
after
all
!
The
precious
moments
were
slipping
*NL*
away
,
but
he
had
forgotten
everything
that
he
had
meant
to
say
to
her
*NL*
and
could
only
helplessly
brood
on
the
mystery
of
their
remoteness
and
*NL*
their
proximity
,
which
seemed
to
be
symbolised
by
the
fact
of
their
*NL*
sitting
so
close
to
each
other
,
and
yet
being
unable
to
see
each
*NL*
other
's
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pretty
carriage
!
Is
it
May
's
?
''
she
asked
,
suddenly
turning
her
*NL*
face
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
May
who
sent
you
to
fetch
me
,
then
?
How
kind
of
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
;
then
he
said
explosively
:
``
Your
*NL*
husband
's
secretary
came
to
see
me
the
day
after
we
met
in
Boston
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
brief
letter
to
her
he
had
made
no
allusion
to
M.
Riviere
's
*NL*
visit
,
and
his
intention
had
been
to
bury
the
incident
in
his
bosom
.
*NL*
But
her
reminder
that
they
were
in
his
wife
's
carriage
provoked
him
to
*NL*
an
impulse
of
retaliation
.
He
would
see
if
she
liked
his
reference
to
*NL*
Riviere
any
better
than
he
liked
hers
to
May
!
As
on
certain
other
*NL*
occasions
when
he
had
expected
to
shake
her
out
of
her
usual
composure
,
*NL*
she
betrayed
no
sign
of
surprise
:
and
at
once
he
concluded
:
``
He
writes
*NL*
to
her
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Riviere
went
to
see
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
did
n't
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
not
surprised
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
Why
should
I
be
?
He
told
me
in
Boston
that
he
knew
*NL*
you
;
that
he
'd
met
you
in
England
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
--
I
must
ask
you
one
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
ask
it
after
I
saw
him
,
but
I
could
n't
put
it
in
a
letter
.
*NL*
It
was
Riviere
who
helped
you
to
get
away
--
when
you
left
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
was
beating
suffocatingly
.
Would
she
meet
this
question
with
*NL*
the
same
composure
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
I
owe
him
a
great
debt
,
''
she
answered
,
without
the
least
tremor
*NL*
in
her
quiet
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
so
natural
,
so
almost
indifferent
,
that
Archer
's
turmoil
*NL*
subsided
.
Once
more
she
had
managed
,
by
her
sheer
simplicity
,
to
make
*NL*
him
feel
stupidly
conventional
just
when
he
thought
he
was
flinging
*NL*
convention
to
the
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
the
most
honest
woman
I
ever
met
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
--
but
probably
one
of
the
least
fussy
,
''
she
answered
,
a
smile
in
*NL*
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
what
you
like
:
you
look
at
things
as
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
I
've
had
to
.
I
've
had
to
look
at
the
Gorgon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
has
n't
blinded
you
!
You
've
seen
that
she
's
just
an
old
bogey
*NL*
like
all
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
blind
one
;
but
she
dries
up
one
's
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
checked
the
pleading
on
Archer
's
lips
:
it
seemed
to
come
*NL*
from
depths
of
experience
beyond
his
reach
.
The
slow
advance
of
the
*NL*
ferry-boat
had
ceased
,
and
her
bows
bumped
against
the
piles
of
the
*NL*
slip
with
a
violence
that
made
the
brougham
stagger
,
and
flung
Archer
*NL*
and
Madame
Olenska
against
each
other
.
The
young
man
,
trembling
,
felt
*NL*
the
pressure
of
her
shoulder
,
and
passed
his
arm
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
not
blind
,
then
,
you
must
see
that
this
ca
n't
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
ca
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
being
together
--
and
not
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
You
ought
not
to
have
come
today
,
''
she
said
in
an
altered
voice
;
*NL*
and
suddenly
she
turned
,
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
pressed
her
lips
*NL*
to
his
.
At
the
same
moment
the
carriage
began
to
move
,
and
a
gas-lamp
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
slip
flashed
its
light
into
the
window
.
She
drew
*NL*
away
,
and
they
sat
silent
and
motionless
while
the
brougham
struggled
*NL*
through
the
congestion
of
carriages
about
the
ferry-landing
.
As
they
*NL*
gained
the
street
Archer
began
to
speak
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
:
you
need
n't
squeeze
yourself
back
into
your
*NL*
corner
like
that
.
A
stolen
kiss
is
n't
what
I
want
.
Look
:
I
'm
not
even
*NL*
trying
to
touch
the
sleeve
of
your
jacket
.
Do
n't
suppose
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
your
reasons
for
not
wanting
to
let
this
feeling
between
us
*NL*
dwindle
into
an
ordinary
hole-and-corner
love-affair
.
I
could
n't
have
*NL*
spoken
like
this
yesterday
,
because
when
we
've
been
apart
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
,
every
thought
is
burnt
up
in
a
great
*NL*
flame
.
But
then
you
come
;
and
you
're
so
much
more
than
I
remembered
,
*NL*
and
what
I
want
of
you
is
so
much
more
than
an
hour
or
two
every
now
*NL*
and
then
,
with
wastes
of
thirsty
waiting
between
,
that
I
can
sit
*NL*
perfectly
still
beside
you
,
like
this
,
with
that
other
vision
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
just
quietly
trusting
to
it
to
come
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
made
no
reply
;
then
she
asked
,
hardly
above
a
whisper
:
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
trusting
to
it
to
come
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
you
know
it
will
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
vision
of
you
and
me
together
?
''
She
burst
into
a
sudden
hard
*NL*
laugh
.
``
You
choose
your
place
well
to
put
it
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
because
we
're
in
my
wife
's
brougham
?
Shall
we
get
out
and
*NL*
walk
,
then
?
I
do
n't
suppose
you
mind
a
little
snow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
again
,
more
gently
.
``
No
;
I
sha
n't
get
out
and
walk
,
*NL*
because
my
business
is
to
get
to
Granny
's
as
quickly
as
I
can
.
And
*NL*
you
'll
sit
beside
me
,
and
we
'll
look
,
not
at
visions
,
but
at
realities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
realities
.
The
only
reality
to
me
is
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
the
words
with
a
long
silence
,
during
which
the
carriage
rolled
*NL*
down
an
obscure
side-street
and
then
turned
into
the
searching
*NL*
illumination
of
Fifth
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
idea
,
then
,
that
I
should
live
with
you
as
your
*NL*
mistress
--
since
I
ca
n't
be
your
wife
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crudeness
of
the
question
startled
him
:
the
word
was
one
that
women
*NL*
of
his
class
fought
shy
of
,
even
when
their
talk
flitted
closest
about
*NL*
the
topic
.
He
noticed
that
Madame
Olenska
pronounced
it
as
if
it
had
a
*NL*
recognised
place
in
her
vocabulary
,
and
he
wondered
if
it
had
been
used
*NL*
familiarly
in
her
presence
in
the
horrible
life
she
had
fled
from
.
Her
*NL*
question
pulled
him
up
with
a
jerk
,
and
he
floundered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
--
I
want
somehow
to
get
away
with
you
into
a
world
where
words
*NL*
like
that
--
categories
like
that
--
wo
n't
exist
.
Where
we
shall
be
simply
*NL*
two
human
beings
who
love
each
other
,
who
are
the
whole
of
life
to
each
*NL*
other
;
and
nothing
else
on
earth
will
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
a
deep
sigh
that
ended
in
another
laugh
.
``
Oh
,
my
dear
--
where
*NL*
is
that
country
?
Have
you
ever
been
there
?
''
she
asked
;
and
as
he
*NL*
remained
sullenly
dumb
she
went
on
:
``
I
know
so
many
who
've
tried
to
*NL*
find
it
;
and
,
believe
me
,
they
all
got
out
by
mistake
at
wayside
*NL*
stations
:
at
places
like
Boulogne
,
or
Pisa
,
or
Monte
Carlo
--
and
it
*NL*
was
n't
at
all
different
from
the
old
world
they
'd
left
,
but
only
rather
*NL*
smaller
and
dingier
and
more
promiscuous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
heard
her
speak
in
such
a
tone
,
and
he
remembered
the
*NL*
phrase
she
had
used
a
little
while
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
Gorgon
HAS
dried
your
tears
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
opened
my
eyes
too
;
it
's
a
delusion
to
say
that
she
blinds
*NL*
people
.
What
she
does
is
just
the
contrary
--
she
fastens
their
eyelids
*NL*
open
,
so
that
they
're
never
again
in
the
blessed
darkness
.
Is
n't
there
*NL*
a
Chinese
torture
like
that
?
There
ought
to
be
.
Ah
,
believe
me
,
it
's
*NL*
a
miserable
little
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
had
crossed
Forty-second
Street
:
May
's
sturdy
*NL*
brougham-horse
was
carrying
them
northward
as
if
he
had
been
a
Kentucky
*NL*
trotter
.
Archer
choked
with
the
sense
of
wasted
minutes
and
vain
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
,
exactly
,
is
your
plan
for
us
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
US
?
But
there
's
no
US
in
that
sense
!
We
're
near
each
other
only
*NL*
if
we
stay
far
from
each
other
.
Then
we
can
be
ourselves
.
Otherwise
*NL*
we
're
only
Newland
Archer
,
the
husband
of
Ellen
Olenska
's
cousin
,
and
*NL*
Ellen
Olenska
,
the
cousin
of
Newland
Archer
's
wife
,
trying
to
be
happy
*NL*
behind
the
backs
of
the
people
who
trust
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
beyond
that
,
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
're
not
!
You
've
never
been
beyond
.
And
I
have
,
''
she
said
,
in
*NL*
a
strange
voice
,
``
and
I
know
what
it
looks
like
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
silent
,
dazed
with
inarticulate
pain
.
Then
he
groped
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
carriage
for
the
little
bell
that
signalled
orders
to
*NL*
the
coachman
.
He
remembered
that
May
rang
twice
when
she
wished
to
*NL*
stop
.
He
pressed
the
bell
,
and
the
carriage
drew
up
beside
the
*NL*
curbstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
we
stopping
?
This
is
not
Granny
's
,
''
Madame
Olenska
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
I
shall
get
out
here
,
''
he
stammered
,
opening
the
door
and
jumping
*NL*
to
the
pavement
.
By
the
light
of
a
street-lamp
he
saw
her
startled
*NL*
face
,
and
the
instinctive
motion
she
made
to
detain
him
.
He
closed
the
*NL*
door
,
and
leaned
for
a
moment
in
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
:
I
ought
not
to
have
come
today
,
''
he
said
,
lowering
his
*NL*
voice
so
that
the
coachman
should
not
hear
.
She
bent
forward
,
and
*NL*
seemed
about
to
speak
;
but
he
had
already
called
out
the
order
to
drive
*NL*
on
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
away
while
he
stood
on
the
corner
.
The
*NL*
snow
was
over
,
and
a
tingling
wind
had
sprung
up
,
that
lashed
his
face
*NL*
as
he
stood
gazing
.
Suddenly
he
felt
something
stiff
and
cold
on
his
*NL*
lashes
,
and
perceived
that
he
had
been
crying
,
and
that
the
wind
had
*NL*
frozen
his
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
walked
at
a
sharp
pace
down
*NL*
Fifth
Avenue
to
his
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
when
Archer
came
down
before
dinner
he
found
the
*NL*
drawing-room
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
May
were
dining
alone
,
all
the
family
engagements
having
been
*NL*
postponed
since
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
illness
;
and
as
May
was
the
more
*NL*
punctual
of
the
two
he
was
surprised
that
she
had
not
preceded
him
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
she
was
at
home
,
for
while
he
dressed
he
had
heard
her
moving
*NL*
about
in
her
room
;
and
he
wondered
what
had
delayed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
dwelling
on
such
conjectures
as
a
means
*NL*
of
tying
his
thoughts
fast
to
reality
.
Sometimes
he
felt
as
if
he
had
*NL*
found
the
clue
to
his
father-in-law
's
absorption
in
trifles
;
perhaps
*NL*
even
Mr.
Welland
,
long
ago
,
had
had
escapes
and
visions
,
and
had
*NL*
conjured
up
all
the
hosts
of
domesticity
to
defend
himself
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
May
appeared
he
thought
she
looked
tired
.
She
had
put
on
the
*NL*
low-necked
and
tightly-laced
dinner-dress
which
the
Mingott
ceremonial
*NL*
exacted
on
the
most
informal
occasions
,
and
had
built
her
fair
hair
*NL*
into
its
usual
accumulated
coils
;
and
her
face
,
in
contrast
,
was
wan
*NL*
and
almost
faded
.
But
she
shone
on
him
with
her
usual
tenderness
,
and
*NL*
her
eyes
had
kept
the
blue
dazzle
of
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
became
of
you
,
dear
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
was
waiting
at
Granny
's
,
and
*NL*
Ellen
came
alone
,
and
said
she
had
dropped
you
on
the
way
because
you
*NL*
had
to
rush
off
on
business
.
There
's
nothing
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
some
letters
I
'd
forgotten
,
and
wanted
to
get
off
before
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
''
she
said
;
and
a
moment
afterward
:
``
I
'm
sorry
you
did
n't
come
to
*NL*
Granny
's
--
unless
the
letters
were
urgent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
,
''
he
rejoined
,
surprised
at
her
insistence
.
``
Besides
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
why
I
should
have
gone
to
your
grandmother
's
.
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
you
were
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
moved
to
the
looking-glass
above
the
mantel-piece
.
As
*NL*
she
stood
there
,
lifting
her
long
arm
to
fasten
a
puff
that
had
slipped
*NL*
from
its
place
in
her
intricate
hair
,
Archer
was
struck
by
something
*NL*
languid
and
inelastic
in
her
attitude
,
and
wondered
if
the
deadly
*NL*
monotony
of
their
lives
had
laid
its
weight
on
her
also
.
Then
he
*NL*
remembered
that
,
as
he
had
left
the
house
that
morning
,
she
had
called
*NL*
over
the
stairs
that
she
would
meet
him
at
her
grandmother
's
so
that
*NL*
they
might
drive
home
together
.
He
had
called
back
a
cheery
``
Yes
!
''
and
*NL*
then
,
absorbed
in
other
visions
,
had
forgotten
his
promise
.
Now
he
was
*NL*
smitten
with
compunction
,
yet
irritated
that
so
trifling
an
omission
*NL*
should
be
stored
up
against
him
after
nearly
two
years
of
marriage
.
He
*NL*
was
weary
of
living
in
a
perpetual
tepid
honeymoon
,
without
the
*NL*
temperature
of
passion
yet
with
all
its
exactions
.
If
May
had
spoken
*NL*
out
her
grievances
-LRB-
he
suspected
her
of
many
-RRB-
he
might
have
laughed
*NL*
them
away
;
but
she
was
trained
to
conceal
imaginary
wounds
under
a
*NL*
Spartan
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
disguise
his
own
annoyance
he
asked
how
her
grandmother
was
,
and
she
*NL*
answered
that
Mrs.
Mingott
was
still
improving
,
but
had
been
rather
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
last
news
about
the
Beauforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
they
're
going
to
stay
in
New
York
.
I
believe
he
's
going
into
*NL*
an
insurance
business
,
or
something
.
They
're
looking
about
for
a
small
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
preposterousness
of
the
case
was
beyond
discussion
,
and
they
went
*NL*
in
to
dinner
.
During
dinner
their
talk
moved
in
its
usual
limited
*NL*
circle
;
but
Archer
noticed
that
his
wife
made
no
allusion
to
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
,
nor
to
old
Catherine
's
reception
of
her
.
He
was
thankful
for
*NL*
the
fact
,
yet
felt
it
to
be
vaguely
ominous
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
up
to
the
library
for
coffee
,
and
Archer
lit
a
cigar
and
took
*NL*
down
a
volume
of
Michelet
.
He
had
taken
to
history
in
the
evenings
*NL*
since
May
had
shown
a
tendency
to
ask
him
to
read
aloud
whenever
she
*NL*
saw
him
with
a
volume
of
poetry
:
not
that
he
disliked
the
sound
of
his
*NL*
own
voice
,
but
because
he
could
always
foresee
her
comments
on
what
he
*NL*
read
.
In
the
days
of
their
engagement
she
had
simply
-LRB-
as
he
now
*NL*
perceived
-RRB-
echoed
what
he
told
her
;
but
since
he
had
ceased
to
provide
*NL*
her
with
opinions
she
had
begun
to
hazard
her
own
,
with
results
*NL*
destructive
to
his
enjoyment
of
the
works
commented
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
he
had
chosen
history
she
fetched
her
workbasket
,
drew
up
*NL*
an
arm-chair
to
the
green-shaded
student
lamp
,
and
uncovered
a
cushion
*NL*
she
was
embroidering
for
his
sofa
.
She
was
not
a
clever
needle-woman
;
*NL*
her
large
capable
hands
were
made
for
riding
,
rowing
and
open-air
*NL*
activities
;
but
since
other
wives
embroidered
cushions
for
their
*NL*
husbands
she
did
not
wish
to
omit
this
last
link
in
her
devotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
placed
that
Archer
,
by
merely
raising
his
eyes
,
could
see
*NL*
her
bent
above
her
work-frame
,
her
ruffled
elbow-sleeves
slipping
back
*NL*
from
her
firm
round
arms
,
the
betrothal
sapphire
shining
on
her
left
*NL*
hand
above
her
broad
gold
wedding-ring
,
and
the
right
hand
slowly
and
*NL*
laboriously
stabbing
the
canvas
.
As
she
sat
thus
,
the
lamplight
full
*NL*
on
her
clear
brow
,
he
said
to
himself
with
a
secret
dismay
that
he
*NL*
would
always
know
the
thoughts
behind
it
,
that
never
,
in
all
the
years
*NL*
to
come
,
would
she
surprise
him
by
an
unexpected
mood
,
by
a
new
idea
,
a
*NL*
weakness
,
a
cruelty
or
an
emotion
.
She
had
spent
her
poetry
and
*NL*
romance
on
their
short
courting
:
the
function
was
exhausted
because
the
*NL*
need
was
past
.
Now
she
was
simply
ripening
into
a
copy
of
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
mysteriously
,
by
the
very
process
,
trying
to
turn
him
into
a
Mr.
*NL*
Welland
.
He
laid
down
his
book
and
stood
up
impatiently
;
and
at
once
*NL*
she
raised
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
room
is
stifling
:
I
want
a
little
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
insisted
that
the
library
curtains
should
draw
backward
and
*NL*
forward
on
a
rod
,
so
that
they
might
be
closed
in
the
evening
,
instead
*NL*
of
remaining
nailed
to
a
gilt
cornice
,
and
immovably
looped
up
over
*NL*
layers
of
lace
,
as
in
the
drawing-room
;
and
he
pulled
them
back
and
*NL*
pushed
up
the
sash
,
leaning
out
into
the
icy
night
.
The
mere
fact
of
*NL*
not
looking
at
May
,
seated
beside
his
table
,
under
his
lamp
,
the
fact
*NL*
of
seeing
other
houses
,
roofs
,
chimneys
,
of
getting
the
sense
of
other
*NL*
lives
outside
his
own
,
other
cities
beyond
New
York
,
and
a
whole
world
*NL*
beyond
his
world
,
cleared
his
brain
and
made
it
easier
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
leaned
out
into
the
darkness
for
a
few
minutes
he
heard
*NL*
her
say
:
``
Newland
!
Do
shut
the
window
.
You
'll
catch
your
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
the
sash
down
and
turned
back
.
``
Catch
my
death
!
''
he
echoed
;
*NL*
and
he
felt
like
adding
:
``
But
I
've
caught
it
already
.
I
AM
dead
--
I
've
*NL*
been
dead
for
months
and
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
the
play
of
the
word
flashed
up
a
wild
suggestion
.
What
*NL*
if
it
were
SHE
who
was
dead
!
If
she
were
going
to
die
--
to
die
*NL*
soon
--
and
leave
him
free
!
The
sensation
of
standing
there
,
in
that
*NL*
warm
familiar
room
,
and
looking
at
her
,
and
wishing
her
dead
,
was
so
*NL*
strange
,
so
fascinating
and
overmastering
,
that
its
enormity
did
not
*NL*
immediately
strike
him
.
He
simply
felt
that
chance
had
given
him
a
new
*NL*
possibility
to
which
his
sick
soul
might
cling
.
Yes
,
May
might
*NL*
die
--
people
did
:
young
people
,
healthy
people
like
herself
:
she
might
*NL*
die
,
and
set
him
suddenly
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
up
,
and
he
saw
by
her
widening
eyes
that
there
must
be
*NL*
something
strange
in
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Newland
!
Are
you
ill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
and
turned
toward
his
arm-chair
.
She
bent
over
her
*NL*
work-frame
,
and
as
he
passed
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
hair
.
``
Poor
May
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
?
Why
poor
?
''
she
echoed
with
a
strained
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
shall
never
be
able
to
open
a
window
without
worrying
you
,
''
*NL*
he
rejoined
,
laughing
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
was
silent
;
then
she
said
very
low
,
her
head
bowed
*NL*
over
her
work
:
``
I
shall
never
worry
if
you
're
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
;
and
I
shall
never
be
happy
unless
I
can
open
the
windows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
THIS
weather
?
''
she
remonstrated
;
and
with
a
sigh
he
buried
his
head
*NL*
in
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
or
seven
days
passed
.
Archer
heard
nothing
from
Madame
Olenska
,
*NL*
and
became
aware
that
her
name
would
not
be
mentioned
in
his
presence
*NL*
by
any
member
of
the
family
.
He
did
not
try
to
see
her
;
to
do
so
while
*NL*
she
was
at
old
Catherine
's
guarded
bedside
would
have
been
almost
*NL*
impossible
.
In
the
uncertainty
of
the
situation
he
let
himself
drift
,
*NL*
conscious
,
somewhere
below
the
surface
of
his
thoughts
,
of
a
resolve
*NL*
which
had
come
to
him
when
he
had
leaned
out
from
his
library
window
*NL*
into
the
icy
night
.
The
strength
of
that
resolve
made
it
easy
to
wait
*NL*
and
make
no
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
day
May
told
him
that
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
had
asked
to
see
*NL*
him
.
There
was
nothing
surprising
in
the
request
,
for
the
old
lady
was
*NL*
steadily
recovering
,
and
she
had
always
openly
declared
that
she
*NL*
preferred
Archer
to
any
of
her
other
grandsons-in-law
.
May
gave
the
*NL*
message
with
evident
pleasure
:
she
was
proud
of
old
Catherine
's
*NL*
appreciation
of
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
,
and
then
Archer
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
*NL*
say
:
``
All
right
.
Shall
we
go
together
this
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
's
face
brightened
,
but
she
instantly
answered
:
``
Oh
,
you
'd
much
*NL*
better
go
alone
.
It
bores
Granny
to
see
the
same
people
too
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
heart
was
beating
violently
when
he
rang
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
*NL*
bell
.
He
had
wanted
above
all
things
to
go
alone
,
for
he
felt
sure
the
*NL*
visit
would
give
him
the
chance
of
saying
a
word
in
private
to
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
.
He
had
determined
to
wait
till
the
chance
presented
*NL*
itself
naturally
;
and
here
it
was
,
and
here
he
was
on
the
doorstep
.
*NL*
Behind
the
door
,
behind
the
curtains
of
the
yellow
damask
room
next
to
*NL*
the
hall
,
she
was
surely
awaiting
him
;
in
another
moment
he
should
see
*NL*
her
,
and
be
able
to
speak
to
her
before
she
led
him
to
the
sick-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
only
to
put
one
question
:
after
that
his
course
would
be
*NL*
clear
.
What
he
wished
to
ask
was
simply
the
date
of
her
return
to
*NL*
Washington
;
and
that
question
she
could
hardly
refuse
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
yellow
sitting-room
it
was
the
mulatto
maid
who
waited
.
Her
*NL*
white
teeth
shining
like
a
keyboard
,
she
pushed
back
the
sliding
doors
*NL*
and
ushered
him
into
old
Catherine
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
sat
in
a
vast
throne-like
arm-chair
near
her
bed
.
Beside
*NL*
her
was
a
mahogany
stand
bearing
a
cast
bronze
lamp
with
an
engraved
*NL*
globe
,
over
which
a
green
paper
shade
had
been
balanced
.
There
was
not
*NL*
a
book
or
a
newspaper
in
reach
,
nor
any
evidence
of
feminine
*NL*
employment
:
conversation
had
always
been
Mrs.
Mingott
's
sole
pursuit
,
*NL*
and
she
would
have
scorned
to
feign
an
interest
in
fancywork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
saw
no
trace
of
the
slight
distortion
left
by
her
stroke
.
She
*NL*
merely
looked
paler
,
with
darker
shadows
in
the
folds
and
recesses
of
*NL*
her
obesity
;
and
,
in
the
fluted
mob-cap
tied
by
a
starched
bow
between
*NL*
her
first
two
chins
,
and
the
muslin
kerchief
crossed
over
her
billowing
*NL*
purple
dressing-gown
,
she
seemed
like
some
shrewd
and
kindly
ancestress
*NL*
of
her
own
who
might
have
yielded
too
freely
to
the
pleasures
of
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
out
one
of
the
little
hands
that
nestled
in
a
hollow
of
her
*NL*
huge
lap
like
pet
animals
,
and
called
to
the
maid
:
``
Do
n't
let
in
any
*NL*
one
else
.
If
my
daughters
call
,
say
I
'm
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
maid
disappeared
,
and
the
old
lady
turned
to
her
grandson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
am
I
perfectly
hideous
?
''
she
asked
gaily
,
launching
out
one
*NL*
hand
in
search
of
the
folds
of
muslin
on
her
inaccessible
bosom
.
``
My
*NL*
daughters
tell
me
it
does
n't
matter
at
my
age
--
as
if
hideousness
did
n't
*NL*
matter
all
the
more
the
harder
it
gets
to
conceal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
're
handsomer
than
ever
!
''
Archer
rejoined
in
the
same
*NL*
tone
;
and
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
not
as
handsome
as
Ellen
!
''
she
jerked
out
,
twinkling
at
him
*NL*
maliciously
;
and
before
he
could
answer
she
added
:
``
Was
she
so
awfully
*NL*
handsome
the
day
you
drove
her
up
from
the
ferry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
and
she
continued
:
``
Was
it
because
you
told
her
so
that
*NL*
she
had
to
put
you
out
on
the
way
?
In
my
youth
young
men
did
n't
desert
*NL*
pretty
women
unless
they
were
made
to
!
''
She
gave
another
chuckle
,
and
*NL*
interrupted
it
to
say
almost
querulously
:
``
It
's
a
pity
she
did
n't
*NL*
marry
you
;
I
always
told
her
so
.
It
would
have
spared
me
all
this
*NL*
worry
.
But
who
ever
thought
of
sparing
their
grandmother
worry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
wondered
if
her
illness
had
blurred
her
faculties
;
but
suddenly
*NL*
she
broke
out
:
``
Well
,
it
's
settled
,
anyhow
:
she
's
going
to
stay
with
*NL*
me
,
whatever
the
rest
of
the
family
say
!
She
had
n't
been
here
five
*NL*
minutes
before
I
'd
have
gone
down
on
my
knees
to
keep
her
--
if
only
,
for
*NL*
the
last
twenty
years
,
I
'd
been
able
to
see
where
the
floor
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
listened
in
silence
,
and
she
went
on
:
``
They
'd
talked
me
over
,
*NL*
as
no
doubt
you
know
:
persuaded
me
,
Lovell
,
and
Letterblair
,
and
*NL*
Augusta
Welland
,
and
all
the
rest
of
them
,
that
I
must
hold
out
and
cut
*NL*
off
her
allowance
,
till
she
was
made
to
see
that
it
was
her
duty
to
go
*NL*
back
to
Olenski
.
They
thought
they
'd
convinced
me
when
the
secretary
,
*NL*
or
whatever
he
was
,
came
out
with
the
last
proposals
:
handsome
*NL*
proposals
I
confess
they
were
.
After
all
,
marriage
is
marriage
,
and
*NL*
money
's
money
--
both
useful
things
in
their
way
...
and
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
answer
--
''
She
broke
off
and
drew
a
long
breath
,
as
if
speaking
*NL*
had
become
an
effort
.
``
But
the
minute
I
laid
eyes
on
her
,
I
said
:
*NL*
`
You
sweet
bird
,
you
!
Shut
you
up
in
that
cage
again
?
Never
!
'
And
*NL*
now
it
's
settled
that
she
's
to
stay
here
and
nurse
her
Granny
as
long
*NL*
as
there
's
a
Granny
to
nurse
.
It
's
not
a
gay
prospect
,
but
she
does
n't
*NL*
mind
;
and
of
course
I
've
told
Letterblair
that
she
's
to
be
given
her
*NL*
proper
allowance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
heard
her
with
veins
aglow
;
but
in
his
confusion
of
mind
*NL*
he
hardly
knew
whether
her
news
brought
joy
or
pain
.
He
had
so
*NL*
definitely
decided
on
the
course
he
meant
to
pursue
that
for
the
moment
*NL*
he
could
not
readjust
his
thoughts
.
But
gradually
there
stole
over
him
*NL*
the
delicious
sense
of
difficulties
deferred
and
opportunities
*NL*
miraculously
provided
.
If
Ellen
had
consented
to
come
and
live
with
*NL*
her
grandmother
it
must
surely
be
because
she
had
recognised
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
giving
him
up
.
This
was
her
answer
to
his
final
*NL*
appeal
of
the
other
day
:
if
she
would
not
take
the
extreme
step
he
had
*NL*
urged
,
she
had
at
last
yielded
to
half-measures
.
He
sank
back
into
the
*NL*
thought
with
the
involuntary
relief
of
a
man
who
has
been
ready
to
risk
*NL*
everything
,
and
suddenly
tastes
the
dangerous
sweetness
of
security
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
have
gone
back
--
it
was
impossible
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
,
I
always
knew
you
were
on
her
side
;
and
that
's
why
I
sent
*NL*
for
you
today
,
and
why
I
said
to
your
pretty
wife
,
when
she
proposed
to
*NL*
come
with
you
:
`
No
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
pining
to
see
Newland
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
anybody
to
share
our
transports
.
'
For
you
see
,
my
dear
--
''
she
*NL*
drew
her
head
back
as
far
as
its
tethering
chins
permitted
,
and
looked
*NL*
him
full
in
the
eyes
--
``
you
see
,
we
shall
have
a
fight
yet
.
The
family
*NL*
do
n't
want
her
here
,
and
they
'll
say
it
's
because
I
've
been
ill
,
*NL*
because
I
'm
a
weak
old
woman
,
that
she
's
persuaded
me
.
I
'm
not
well
*NL*
enough
yet
to
fight
them
one
by
one
,
and
you
've
got
to
do
it
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
.
Why
not
?
''
she
jerked
back
at
him
,
her
round
eyes
suddenly
as
*NL*
sharp
as
pen-knives
.
Her
hand
fluttered
from
its
chair-arm
and
lit
on
*NL*
his
with
a
clutch
of
little
pale
nails
like
bird-claws
.
``
Why
not
?
''
she
*NL*
searchingly
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
under
the
exposure
of
her
gaze
,
had
recovered
his
*NL*
self-possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
count
--
I
'm
too
insignificant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
Letterblair
's
partner
,
ai
n't
you
?
You
've
got
to
get
at
*NL*
them
through
Letterblair
.
Unless
you
've
got
a
reason
,
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
I
back
you
to
hold
your
own
against
them
all
without
my
*NL*
help
;
but
you
shall
have
it
if
you
need
it
,
''
he
reassured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
're
safe
!
''
she
sighed
;
and
smiling
on
him
with
all
her
ancient
*NL*
cunning
she
added
,
as
she
settled
her
head
among
the
cushions
:
``
I
*NL*
always
knew
you
'd
back
us
up
,
because
they
never
quote
you
when
they
*NL*
talk
about
its
being
her
duty
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
winced
a
little
at
her
terrifying
perspicacity
,
and
longed
to
ask
:
*NL*
``
And
May
--
do
they
quote
her
?
''
But
he
judged
it
safer
to
turn
the
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Madame
Olenska
?
When
am
I
to
see
her
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
chuckled
,
crumpled
her
lids
,
and
went
through
the
*NL*
pantomime
of
archness
.
``
Not
today
.
One
at
a
time
,
please
.
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
's
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flushed
with
disappointment
,
and
she
went
on
:
``
She
's
gone
out
,
my
*NL*
child
:
gone
in
my
carriage
to
see
Regina
Beaufort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
for
this
announcement
to
produce
its
effect
.
``
That
's
what
*NL*
she
's
reduced
me
to
already
.
The
day
after
she
got
here
she
put
on
her
*NL*
best
bonnet
,
and
told
me
,
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
,
that
she
was
going
to
*NL*
call
on
Regina
Beaufort
.
'
I
do
n't
know
her
;
who
is
she
?
'
says
I.
*NL*
`
She
's
your
grand-niece
,
and
a
most
unhappy
woman
,
'
she
says
.
`
She
's
*NL*
the
wife
of
a
scoundrel
,
'
I
answered
.
`
Well
,
'
she
says
,
`
and
so
am
I
,
*NL*
and
yet
all
my
family
want
me
to
go
back
to
him
.
'
Well
,
that
floored
*NL*
me
,
and
I
let
her
go
;
and
finally
one
day
she
said
it
was
raining
too
*NL*
hard
to
go
out
on
foot
,
and
she
wanted
me
to
lend
her
my
carriage
.
*NL*
`
What
for
?
'
I
asked
her
;
and
she
said
:
`
To
go
and
see
cousin
*NL*
Regina
'
--
COUSIN
!
Now
,
my
dear
,
I
looked
out
of
the
window
,
and
saw
it
*NL*
was
n't
raining
a
drop
;
but
I
understood
her
,
and
I
let
her
have
the
*NL*
carriage
...
After
all
,
Regina
's
a
brave
woman
,
and
so
is
she
;
and
*NL*
I
've
always
liked
courage
above
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
bent
down
and
pressed
his
lips
on
the
little
hand
that
still
lay
*NL*
on
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
--
eh
--
eh
!
Whose
hand
did
you
think
you
were
kissing
,
young
*NL*
man
--
your
wife
's
,
I
hope
?
''
the
old
lady
snapped
out
with
her
mocking
*NL*
cackle
;
and
as
he
rose
to
go
she
called
out
after
him
:
``
Give
her
her
*NL*
Granny
's
love
;
but
you
'd
better
not
say
anything
about
our
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
been
stunned
by
old
Catherine
's
news
.
It
was
only
natural
*NL*
that
Madame
Olenska
should
have
hastened
from
Washington
in
response
to
*NL*
her
grandmother
's
summons
;
but
that
she
should
have
decided
to
remain
*NL*
under
her
roof
--
especially
now
that
Mrs.
Mingott
had
almost
regained
*NL*
her
health
--
was
less
easy
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
was
sure
that
Madame
Olenska
's
decision
had
not
been
influenced
*NL*
by
the
change
in
her
financial
situation
.
He
knew
the
exact
figure
of
*NL*
the
small
income
which
her
husband
had
allowed
her
at
their
separation
.
*NL*
Without
the
addition
of
her
grandmother
's
allowance
it
was
hardly
*NL*
enough
to
live
on
,
in
any
sense
known
to
the
Mingott
vocabulary
;
and
*NL*
now
that
Medora
Manson
,
who
shared
her
life
,
had
been
ruined
,
such
a
*NL*
pittance
would
barely
keep
the
two
women
clothed
and
fed
.
Yet
Archer
*NL*
was
convinced
that
Madame
Olenska
had
not
accepted
her
grandmother
's
*NL*
offer
from
interested
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
the
heedless
generosity
and
the
spasmodic
extravagance
of
*NL*
persons
used
to
large
fortunes
,
and
indifferent
to
money
;
but
she
could
*NL*
go
without
many
things
which
her
relations
considered
indispensable
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
Mrs.
Welland
had
often
been
heard
to
*NL*
deplore
that
any
one
who
had
enjoyed
the
cosmopolitan
luxuries
of
Count
*NL*
Olenski
's
establishments
should
care
so
little
about
``
how
things
were
*NL*
done
.
''
Moreover
,
as
Archer
knew
,
several
months
had
passed
since
her
*NL*
allowance
had
been
cut
off
;
yet
in
the
interval
she
had
made
no
effort
*NL*
to
regain
her
grandmother
's
favour
.
Therefore
if
she
had
changed
her
*NL*
course
it
must
be
for
a
different
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
have
far
to
seek
for
that
reason
.
On
the
way
from
the
ferry
*NL*
she
had
told
him
that
he
and
she
must
remain
apart
;
but
she
had
said
it
*NL*
with
her
head
on
his
breast
.
He
knew
that
there
was
no
calculated
*NL*
coquetry
in
her
words
;
she
was
fighting
her
fate
as
he
had
fought
his
,
*NL*
and
clinging
desperately
to
her
resolve
that
they
should
not
break
*NL*
faith
with
the
people
who
trusted
them
.
But
during
the
ten
days
which
*NL*
had
elapsed
since
her
return
to
New
York
she
had
perhaps
guessed
from
*NL*
his
silence
,
and
from
the
fact
of
his
making
no
attempt
to
see
her
,
*NL*
that
he
was
meditating
a
decisive
step
,
a
step
from
which
there
was
no
*NL*
turning
back
.
At
the
thought
,
a
sudden
fear
of
her
own
weakness
might
*NL*
have
seized
her
,
and
she
might
have
felt
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
better
*NL*
to
accept
the
compromise
usual
in
such
cases
,
and
follow
the
line
of
*NL*
least
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
earlier
,
when
he
had
rung
Mrs.
Mingott
's
bell
,
Archer
had
*NL*
fancied
that
his
path
was
clear
before
him
.
He
had
meant
to
have
a
*NL*
word
alone
with
Madame
Olenska
,
and
failing
that
,
to
learn
from
her
*NL*
grandmother
on
what
day
,
and
by
which
train
,
she
was
returning
to
*NL*
Washington
.
In
that
train
he
intended
to
join
her
,
and
travel
with
her
*NL*
to
Washington
,
or
as
much
farther
as
she
was
willing
to
go
.
His
own
*NL*
fancy
inclined
to
Japan
.
At
any
rate
she
would
understand
at
once
*NL*
that
,
wherever
she
went
,
he
was
going
.
He
meant
to
leave
a
note
for
*NL*
May
that
should
cut
off
any
other
alternative
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fancied
himself
not
only
nerved
for
this
plunge
but
eager
to
*NL*
take
it
;
yet
his
first
feeling
on
hearing
that
the
course
of
events
was
*NL*
changed
had
been
one
of
relief
.
Now
,
however
,
as
he
walked
home
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Mingott
's
,
he
was
conscious
of
a
growing
distaste
for
what
lay
*NL*
before
him
.
There
was
nothing
unknown
or
unfamiliar
in
the
path
he
was
*NL*
presumably
to
tread
;
but
when
he
had
trodden
it
before
it
was
as
a
free
*NL*
man
,
who
was
accountable
to
no
one
for
his
actions
,
and
could
lend
*NL*
himself
with
an
amused
detachment
to
the
game
of
precautions
and
*NL*
prevarications
,
concealments
and
compliances
,
that
the
part
required
.
*NL*
This
procedure
was
called
``
protecting
a
woman
's
honour
''
;
and
the
best
*NL*
fiction
,
combined
with
the
after-dinner
talk
of
his
elders
,
had
long
*NL*
since
initiated
him
into
every
detail
of
its
code
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
saw
the
matter
in
a
new
light
,
and
his
part
in
it
seemed
*NL*
singularly
diminished
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
that
which
,
with
a
secret
*NL*
fatuity
,
he
had
watched
Mrs.
Thorley
Rushworth
play
toward
a
fond
and
*NL*
unperceiving
husband
:
a
smiling
,
bantering
,
humouring
,
watchful
and
*NL*
incessant
lie
.
A
lie
by
day
,
a
lie
by
night
,
a
lie
in
every
touch
and
*NL*
every
look
;
a
lie
in
every
caress
and
every
quarrel
;
a
lie
in
every
*NL*
word
and
in
every
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easier
,
and
less
dastardly
on
the
whole
,
for
a
wife
to
play
such
*NL*
a
part
toward
her
husband
.
A
woman
's
standard
of
truthfulness
was
*NL*
tacitly
held
to
be
lower
:
she
was
the
subject
creature
,
and
versed
in
*NL*
the
arts
of
the
enslaved
.
Then
she
could
always
plead
moods
and
*NL*
nerves
,
and
the
right
not
to
be
held
too
strictly
to
account
;
and
even
*NL*
in
the
most
strait-laced
societies
the
laugh
was
always
against
the
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
Archer
's
little
world
no
one
laughed
at
a
wife
deceived
,
and
a
*NL*
certain
measure
of
contempt
was
attached
to
men
who
continued
their
*NL*
philandering
after
marriage
.
In
the
rotation
of
crops
there
was
a
*NL*
recognised
season
for
wild
oats
;
but
they
were
not
to
be
sown
more
than
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
always
shared
this
view
:
in
his
heart
he
thought
Lefferts
*NL*
despicable
.
But
to
love
Ellen
Olenska
was
not
to
become
a
man
like
*NL*
Lefferts
:
for
the
first
time
Archer
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
*NL*
dread
argument
of
the
individual
case
.
Ellen
Olenska
was
like
no
other
*NL*
woman
,
he
was
like
no
other
man
:
their
situation
,
therefore
,
resembled
*NL*
no
one
else
's
,
and
they
were
answerable
to
no
tribunal
but
that
of
*NL*
their
own
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
but
in
ten
minutes
more
he
would
be
mounting
his
own
doorstep
;
and
*NL*
there
were
May
,
and
habit
,
and
honour
,
and
all
the
old
decencies
that
*NL*
he
and
his
people
had
always
believed
in
...
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
corner
he
hesitated
,
and
then
walked
on
down
Fifth
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ahead
of
him
,
in
the
winter
night
,
loomed
a
big
unlit
house
.
As
he
*NL*
drew
near
he
thought
how
often
he
had
seen
it
blazing
with
lights
,
its
*NL*
steps
awninged
and
carpeted
,
and
carriages
waiting
in
double
line
to
*NL*
draw
up
at
the
curbstone
.
It
was
in
the
conservatory
that
stretched
*NL*
its
dead-black
bulk
down
the
side
street
that
he
had
taken
his
first
*NL*
kiss
from
May
;
it
was
under
the
myriad
candles
of
the
ball-room
that
he
*NL*
had
seen
her
appear
,
tall
and
silver-shining
as
a
young
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
house
was
as
dark
as
the
grave
,
except
for
a
faint
flare
of
gas
*NL*
in
the
basement
,
and
a
light
in
one
upstairs
room
where
the
blind
had
*NL*
not
been
lowered
.
As
Archer
reached
the
corner
he
saw
that
the
*NL*
carriage
standing
at
the
door
was
Mrs.
Manson
Mingott
's
.
What
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
Sillerton
Jackson
,
if
he
should
chance
to
pass
!
Archer
*NL*
had
been
greatly
moved
by
old
Catherine
's
account
of
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
attitude
toward
Mrs.
Beaufort
;
it
made
the
righteous
reprobation
of
New
*NL*
York
seem
like
a
passing
by
on
the
other
side
.
But
he
knew
well
enough
*NL*
what
construction
the
clubs
and
drawing-rooms
would
put
on
Ellen
*NL*
Olenska
's
visits
to
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
lighted
window
.
No
doubt
the
two
women
*NL*
were
sitting
together
in
that
room
:
Beaufort
had
probably
sought
*NL*
consolation
elsewhere
.
There
were
even
rumours
that
he
had
left
New
*NL*
York
with
Fanny
Ring
;
but
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
attitude
made
the
report
seem
*NL*
improbable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
the
nocturnal
perspective
of
Fifth
Avenue
almost
to
himself
.
*NL*
At
that
hour
most
people
were
indoors
,
dressing
for
dinner
;
and
he
was
*NL*
secretly
glad
that
Ellen
's
exit
was
likely
to
be
unobserved
.
As
the
*NL*
thought
passed
through
his
mind
the
door
opened
,
and
she
came
out
.
*NL*
Behind
her
was
a
faint
light
,
such
as
might
have
been
carried
down
the
*NL*
stairs
to
show
her
the
way
.
She
turned
to
say
a
word
to
some
one
;
then
*NL*
the
door
closed
,
and
she
came
down
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
reached
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
with
a
slight
start
,
and
just
then
he
saw
two
young
men
of
*NL*
fashionable
cut
approaching
.
There
was
a
familiar
air
about
their
*NL*
overcoats
and
the
way
their
smart
silk
mufflers
were
folded
over
their
*NL*
white
ties
;
and
he
wondered
how
youths
of
their
quality
happened
to
be
*NL*
dining
out
so
early
.
Then
he
remembered
that
the
Reggie
Chiverses
,
*NL*
whose
house
was
a
few
doors
above
,
were
taking
a
large
party
that
*NL*
evening
to
see
Adelaide
Neilson
in
Romeo
and
Juliet
,
and
guessed
that
*NL*
the
two
were
of
the
number
.
They
passed
under
a
lamp
,
and
he
*NL*
recognised
Lawrence
Lefferts
and
a
young
Chivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mean
desire
not
to
have
Madame
Olenska
seen
at
the
Beauforts
'
door
*NL*
vanished
as
he
felt
the
penetrating
warmth
of
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
you
now
--
we
shall
be
together
,
''
he
broke
out
,
hardly
*NL*
knowing
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
she
answered
,
``
Granny
has
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
watched
her
he
was
aware
that
Lefferts
and
Chivers
,
on
*NL*
reaching
the
farther
side
of
the
street
corner
,
had
discreetly
struck
*NL*
away
across
Fifth
Avenue
.
It
was
the
kind
of
masculine
solidarity
that
*NL*
he
himself
often
practised
;
now
he
sickened
at
their
connivance
.
Did
*NL*
she
really
imagine
that
he
and
she
could
live
like
this
?
And
if
not
,
*NL*
what
else
did
she
imagine
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
I
must
see
you
--
somewhere
where
we
can
be
alone
,
''
he
said
,
in
*NL*
a
voice
that
sounded
almost
angry
to
his
own
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wavered
,
and
moved
toward
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
be
at
Granny
's
--
for
the
present
that
is
,
''
she
added
,
as
if
*NL*
conscious
that
her
change
of
plans
required
some
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somewhere
where
we
can
be
alone
,
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
faint
laugh
that
grated
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
New
York
?
But
there
are
no
churches
...
no
monuments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
Art
Museum
--
in
the
Park
,
''
he
explained
,
as
she
looked
*NL*
puzzled
.
``
At
half-past
two
.
I
shall
be
at
the
door
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
without
answering
and
got
quickly
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
As
it
drove
off
she
leaned
forward
,
and
he
thought
she
waved
her
hand
*NL*
in
the
obscurity
.
He
stared
after
her
in
a
turmoil
of
contradictory
*NL*
feelings
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
speaking
not
to
the
woman
*NL*
he
loved
but
to
another
,
a
woman
he
was
indebted
to
for
pleasures
*NL*
already
wearied
of
:
it
was
hateful
to
find
himself
the
prisoner
of
this
*NL*
hackneyed
vocabulary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
come
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
almost
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avoiding
the
popular
``
Wolfe
collection
,
''
whose
anecdotic
canvases
*NL*
filled
one
of
the
main
galleries
of
the
queer
wilderness
of
cast-iron
*NL*
and
encaustic
tiles
known
as
the
Metropolitan
Museum
,
they
had
wandered
*NL*
down
a
passage
to
the
room
where
the
``
Cesnola
antiquities
''
mouldered
in
*NL*
unvisited
loneliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
this
melancholy
retreat
to
themselves
,
and
seated
on
the
divan
*NL*
enclosing
the
central
steam-radiator
,
they
were
staring
silently
at
the
*NL*
glass
cabinets
mounted
in
ebonised
wood
which
contained
the
recovered
*NL*
fragments
of
Ilium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
odd
,
''
Madame
Olenska
said
,
``
I
never
came
here
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
--
.
Some
day
,
I
suppose
,
it
will
be
a
great
Museum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
assented
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
and
wandered
across
the
room
.
Archer
,
remaining
seated
,
*NL*
watched
the
light
movements
of
her
figure
,
so
girlish
even
under
its
*NL*
heavy
furs
,
the
cleverly
planted
heron
wing
in
her
fur
cap
,
and
the
way
*NL*
a
dark
curl
lay
like
a
flattened
vine
spiral
on
each
cheek
above
the
*NL*
ear
.
His
mind
,
as
always
when
they
first
met
,
was
wholly
absorbed
in
*NL*
the
delicious
details
that
made
her
herself
and
no
other
.
Presently
he
*NL*
rose
and
approached
the
case
before
which
she
stood
.
Its
glass
shelves
*NL*
were
crowded
with
small
broken
objects
--
hardly
recognisable
domestic
*NL*
utensils
,
ornaments
and
personal
trifles
--
made
of
glass
,
of
clay
,
of
*NL*
discoloured
bronze
and
other
time-blurred
substances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
cruel
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
after
a
while
nothing
matters
...
any
*NL*
more
than
these
little
things
,
that
used
to
be
necessary
and
important
*NL*
to
forgotten
people
,
and
now
have
to
be
guessed
at
under
a
magnifying
*NL*
glass
and
labelled
:
`
Use
unknown
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
meanwhile
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
meanwhile
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
stood
there
,
in
her
long
sealskin
coat
,
her
hands
thrust
in
a
*NL*
small
round
muff
,
her
veil
drawn
down
like
a
transparent
mask
to
the
*NL*
tip
of
her
nose
,
and
the
bunch
of
violets
he
had
brought
her
stirring
*NL*
with
her
quickly-taken
breath
,
it
seemed
incredible
that
this
pure
*NL*
harmony
of
line
and
colour
should
ever
suffer
the
stupid
law
of
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
everything
matters
--
that
concerns
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
,
and
turned
back
to
the
divan
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
beside
her
and
waited
;
but
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
echoing
far
*NL*
off
down
the
empty
rooms
,
and
felt
the
pressure
of
the
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
wanted
to
tell
me
?
''
she
asked
,
as
if
she
had
received
*NL*
the
same
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
wanted
to
tell
you
?
''
he
rejoined
.
``
Why
,
that
I
believe
you
*NL*
came
to
New
York
because
you
were
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
my
coming
to
Washington
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
down
at
her
muff
,
and
he
saw
her
hands
stir
in
it
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
WERE
afraid
?
You
knew
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
I
knew
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
?
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
:
this
is
better
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
returned
with
a
long
*NL*
questioning
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
hurt
others
less
.
Is
n't
it
,
after
all
,
what
you
always
*NL*
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
you
here
,
you
mean
--
in
reach
and
yet
out
of
reach
?
To
meet
*NL*
you
in
this
way
,
on
the
sly
?
It
's
the
very
reverse
of
what
I
want
.
I
*NL*
told
you
the
other
day
what
I
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
And
you
still
think
this
--
worse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
times
!
''
He
paused
.
``
It
would
be
easy
to
lie
to
you
;
but
*NL*
the
truth
is
I
think
it
detestable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
do
I
!
''
she
cried
with
a
deep
breath
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
up
impatiently
.
``
Well
,
then
--
it
's
my
turn
to
ask
:
what
is
*NL*
it
,
in
God
's
name
,
that
you
think
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
her
head
and
continued
to
clasp
and
unclasp
her
hands
in
her
*NL*
muff
.
The
step
drew
nearer
,
and
a
guardian
in
a
braided
cap
walked
*NL*
listlessly
through
the
room
like
a
ghost
stalking
through
a
necropolis
.
*NL*
They
fixed
their
eyes
simultaneously
on
the
case
opposite
them
,
and
*NL*
when
the
official
figure
had
vanished
down
a
vista
of
mummies
and
*NL*
sarcophagi
Archer
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
answering
she
murmured
:
``
I
promised
Granny
to
stay
with
her
*NL*
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
here
I
should
be
safer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
her
head
slightly
,
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safer
from
loving
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
profile
did
not
stir
,
but
he
saw
a
tear
overflow
on
her
lashes
and
*NL*
hang
in
a
mesh
of
her
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safer
from
doing
irreparable
harm
.
Do
n't
let
us
be
like
all
the
*NL*
others
!
''
she
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
others
?
I
do
n't
profess
to
be
different
from
my
kind
.
I
'm
*NL*
consumed
by
the
same
wants
and
the
same
longings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
him
with
a
kind
of
terror
,
and
he
saw
a
faint
colour
*NL*
steal
into
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
--
once
come
to
you
;
and
then
go
home
?
''
she
suddenly
hazarded
in
*NL*
a
low
clear
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
rushed
to
the
young
man
's
forehead
.
``
Dearest
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
without
moving
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
held
his
heart
in
his
hands
,
like
a
*NL*
full
cup
that
the
least
motion
might
overbrim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
her
last
phrase
struck
his
ear
and
his
face
clouded
.
``
Go
home
?
*NL*
What
do
you
mean
by
going
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
to
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
expect
me
to
say
yes
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
troubled
eyes
to
his
.
``
What
else
is
there
?
I
ca
n't
*NL*
stay
here
and
lie
to
the
people
who
've
been
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
the
very
reason
why
I
ask
you
to
come
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
destroy
their
lives
,
when
they
've
helped
me
to
remake
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
looking
down
on
her
in
inarticulate
*NL*
despair
.
It
would
have
been
easy
to
say
:
``
Yes
,
come
;
come
once
.
''
He
*NL*
knew
the
power
she
would
put
in
his
hands
if
she
consented
;
there
would
*NL*
be
no
difficulty
then
in
persuading
her
not
to
go
back
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
something
silenced
the
word
on
his
lips
.
A
sort
of
passionate
*NL*
honesty
in
her
made
it
inconceivable
that
he
should
try
to
draw
her
*NL*
into
that
familiar
trap
.
``
If
I
were
to
let
her
come
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
I
should
have
to
let
her
go
again
.
''
And
that
was
not
to
be
*NL*
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
saw
the
shadow
of
the
lashes
on
her
wet
cheek
,
and
wavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
he
began
again
,
``
we
have
lives
of
our
own
...
There
's
no
*NL*
use
attempting
the
impossible
.
You
're
so
unprejudiced
about
some
*NL*
things
,
so
used
,
as
you
say
,
to
looking
at
the
Gorgon
,
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
why
you
're
afraid
to
face
our
case
,
and
see
it
as
it
really
*NL*
is
--
unless
you
think
the
sacrifice
is
not
worth
making
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
also
,
her
lips
tightening
under
a
rapid
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
that
,
then
--
I
must
go
,
''
she
said
,
drawing
her
little
watch
*NL*
from
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
,
and
he
followed
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
then
:
come
to
me
once
,
''
he
said
,
his
head
turning
suddenly
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
losing
her
;
and
for
a
second
or
two
they
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
almost
like
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
he
insisted
.
``
Tomorrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
The
day
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
--
!
''
he
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
disengaged
her
wrist
;
but
for
a
moment
they
continued
to
hold
*NL*
each
other
's
eyes
,
and
he
saw
that
her
face
,
which
had
grown
very
pale
,
*NL*
was
flooded
with
a
deep
inner
radiance
.
His
heart
beat
with
awe
:
he
*NL*
felt
that
he
had
never
before
beheld
love
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
be
late
--
good-bye
.
No
,
do
n't
come
any
farther
than
this
,
''
*NL*
she
cried
,
walking
hurriedly
away
down
the
long
room
,
as
if
the
*NL*
reflected
radiance
in
his
eyes
had
frightened
her
.
When
she
reached
*NL*
the
door
she
turned
for
a
moment
to
wave
a
quick
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
walked
home
alone
.
Darkness
was
falling
when
he
let
himself
*NL*
into
his
house
,
and
he
looked
about
at
the
familiar
objects
in
the
hall
*NL*
as
if
he
viewed
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlour-maid
,
hearing
his
step
,
ran
up
the
stairs
to
light
the
gas
*NL*
on
the
upper
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Archer
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
Mrs.
Archer
went
out
in
the
carriage
after
luncheon
,
and
*NL*
has
n't
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sense
of
relief
he
entered
the
library
and
flung
himself
down
in
*NL*
his
armchair
.
The
parlour-maid
followed
,
bringing
the
student
lamp
and
*NL*
shaking
some
coals
onto
the
dying
fire
.
When
she
left
he
continued
to
*NL*
sit
motionless
,
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
his
chin
on
his
clasped
hands
,
*NL*
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
grate
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
there
without
conscious
thoughts
,
without
sense
of
the
lapse
of
*NL*
time
,
in
a
deep
and
grave
amazement
that
seemed
to
suspend
life
rather
*NL*
than
quicken
it
.
``
This
was
what
had
to
be
,
then
...
this
was
what
had
*NL*
to
be
,
''
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
,
as
if
he
hung
in
the
clutch
of
*NL*
doom
.
What
he
had
dreamed
of
had
been
so
different
that
there
was
a
*NL*
mortal
chill
in
his
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
and
May
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
dreadfully
late
--
you
were
n't
worried
,
were
you
?
''
she
asked
,
laying
*NL*
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
with
one
of
her
rare
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
astonished
.
``
Is
it
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
seven
.
I
believe
you
've
been
asleep
!
''
She
laughed
,
and
drawing
*NL*
out
her
hat
pins
tossed
her
velvet
hat
on
the
sofa
.
She
looked
paler
*NL*
than
usual
,
but
sparkling
with
an
unwonted
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
see
Granny
,
and
just
as
I
was
going
away
Ellen
came
in
from
*NL*
a
walk
;
so
I
stayed
and
had
a
long
talk
with
her
.
It
was
ages
since
*NL*
we
'd
had
a
real
talk
...
''
She
had
dropped
into
her
usual
armchair
,
*NL*
facing
his
,
and
was
running
her
fingers
through
her
rumpled
hair
.
He
*NL*
fancied
she
expected
him
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
really
good
talk
,
''
she
went
on
,
smiling
with
what
seemed
to
Archer
*NL*
an
unnatural
vividness
.
``
She
was
so
dear
--
just
like
the
old
Ellen
.
*NL*
I
'm
afraid
I
have
n't
been
fair
to
her
lately
.
I
've
sometimes
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
stood
up
and
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
,
out
of
the
radius
*NL*
of
the
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
've
thought
--
?
''
he
echoed
as
she
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
I
have
n't
judged
her
fairly
.
She
's
so
different
--
at
*NL*
least
on
the
surface
.
She
takes
up
such
odd
people
--
she
seems
to
like
*NL*
to
make
herself
conspicuous
.
I
suppose
it
's
the
life
she
's
led
in
that
*NL*
fast
European
society
;
no
doubt
we
seem
dreadfully
dull
to
her
.
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
judge
her
unfairly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
again
,
a
little
breathless
with
the
unwonted
length
of
her
*NL*
speech
,
and
sat
with
her
lips
slightly
parted
and
a
deep
blush
on
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
as
he
looked
at
her
,
was
reminded
of
the
glow
which
had
*NL*
suffused
her
face
in
the
Mission
Garden
at
St.
Augustine
.
He
became
*NL*
aware
of
the
same
obscure
effort
in
her
,
the
same
reaching
out
toward
*NL*
something
beyond
the
usual
range
of
her
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
hates
Ellen
,
''
he
thought
,
``
and
she
's
trying
to
overcome
the
*NL*
feeling
,
and
to
get
me
to
help
her
to
overcome
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
moved
him
,
and
for
a
moment
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
*NL*
the
silence
between
them
,
and
throwing
himself
on
her
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
,
do
n't
you
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
why
the
family
have
*NL*
sometimes
been
annoyed
?
We
all
did
what
we
could
for
her
at
first
;
but
*NL*
she
never
seemed
to
understand
.
And
now
this
idea
of
going
to
see
Mrs.
*NL*
Beaufort
,
of
going
there
in
Granny
's
carriage
!
I
'm
afraid
she
's
quite
*NL*
alienated
the
van
der
Luydens
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Archer
with
an
impatient
laugh
.
The
open
door
had
closed
*NL*
between
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
to
dress
;
we
're
dining
out
,
are
n't
we
?
''
he
asked
,
moving
*NL*
from
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
also
,
but
lingered
near
the
hearth
.
As
he
walked
past
her
she
*NL*
moved
forward
impulsively
,
as
though
to
detain
him
:
their
eyes
met
,
and
*NL*
he
saw
that
hers
were
of
the
same
swimming
blue
as
when
he
had
left
her
*NL*
to
drive
to
Jersey
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
kissed
me
today
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
;
and
he
felt
her
*NL*
tremble
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
court
of
the
Tuileries
,
''
said
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
with
his
*NL*
reminiscent
smile
,
``
such
things
were
pretty
openly
tolerated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
the
van
der
Luydens
'
black
walnut
dining-room
in
Madison
*NL*
Avenue
,
and
the
time
the
evening
after
Newland
Archer
's
visit
to
the
*NL*
Museum
of
Art
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
had
come
to
town
for
a
few
*NL*
days
from
Skuytercliff
,
whither
they
had
precipitately
fled
at
the
*NL*
announcement
of
Beaufort
's
failure
.
It
had
been
represented
to
them
*NL*
that
the
disarray
into
which
society
had
been
thrown
by
this
deplorable
*NL*
affair
made
their
presence
in
town
more
necessary
than
ever
.
It
was
*NL*
one
of
the
occasions
when
,
as
Mrs.
Archer
put
it
,
they
``
owed
it
to
*NL*
society
''
to
show
themselves
at
the
Opera
,
and
even
to
open
their
own
*NL*
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
never
do
,
my
dear
Louisa
,
to
let
people
like
Mrs.
Lemuel
*NL*
Struthers
think
they
can
step
into
Regina
's
shoes
.
It
is
just
at
such
*NL*
times
that
new
people
push
in
and
get
a
footing
.
It
was
owing
to
the
*NL*
epidemic
of
chicken-pox
in
New
York
the
winter
Mrs.
Struthers
first
*NL*
appeared
that
the
married
men
slipped
away
to
her
house
while
their
*NL*
wives
were
in
the
nursery
.
You
and
dear
Henry
,
Louisa
,
must
stand
in
*NL*
the
breach
as
you
always
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
could
not
remain
deaf
to
such
a
call
,
and
*NL*
reluctantly
but
heroically
they
had
come
to
town
,
unmuffled
the
house
,
*NL*
and
sent
out
invitations
for
two
dinners
and
an
evening
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
evening
they
had
invited
Sillerton
Jackson
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
and
Newland
and
his
wife
to
go
with
them
to
the
Opera
,
where
*NL*
Faust
was
being
sung
for
the
first
time
that
winter
.
Nothing
was
done
*NL*
without
ceremony
under
the
van
der
Luyden
roof
,
and
though
there
were
*NL*
but
four
guests
the
repast
had
begun
at
seven
punctually
,
so
that
the
*NL*
proper
sequence
of
courses
might
be
served
without
haste
before
the
*NL*
gentlemen
settled
down
to
their
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
not
seen
his
wife
since
the
evening
before
.
He
had
left
*NL*
early
for
the
office
,
where
he
had
plunged
into
an
accumulation
of
*NL*
unimportant
business
.
In
the
afternoon
one
of
the
senior
partners
had
*NL*
made
an
unexpected
call
on
his
time
;
and
he
had
reached
home
so
late
*NL*
that
May
had
preceded
him
to
the
van
der
Luydens
'
,
and
sent
back
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
across
the
Skuytercliff
carnations
and
the
massive
plate
,
she
*NL*
struck
him
as
pale
and
languid
;
but
her
eyes
shone
,
and
she
talked
with
*NL*
exaggerated
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
which
had
called
forth
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
's
favourite
*NL*
allusion
had
been
brought
up
-LRB-
Archer
fancied
not
without
intention
-RRB-
by
*NL*
their
hostess
.
The
Beaufort
failure
,
or
rather
the
Beaufort
attitude
*NL*
since
the
failure
,
was
still
a
fruitful
theme
for
the
drawing-room
*NL*
moralist
;
and
after
it
had
been
thoroughly
examined
and
condemned
Mrs.
*NL*
van
der
Luyden
had
turned
her
scrupulous
eyes
on
May
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
dear
,
that
what
I
hear
is
true
?
I
was
told
your
*NL*
grandmother
Mingott
's
carriage
was
seen
standing
at
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
*NL*
door
.
''
It
was
noticeable
that
she
no
longer
called
the
offending
lady
*NL*
by
her
Christian
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
's
colour
rose
,
and
Mrs.
Archer
put
in
hastily
:
``
If
it
was
,
I
'm
*NL*
convinced
it
was
there
without
Mrs.
Mingott
's
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
think
--
?
''
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
paused
,
sighed
,
and
glanced
at
*NL*
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
''
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
said
,
``
that
Madame
Olenska
's
kind
*NL*
heart
may
have
led
her
into
the
imprudence
of
calling
on
Mrs.
Beaufort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
her
taste
for
peculiar
people
,
''
put
in
Mrs.
Archer
in
a
dry
tone
,
*NL*
while
her
eyes
dwelt
innocently
on
her
son
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
to
think
it
of
Madame
Olenska
,
''
said
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Archer
murmured
:
``
Ah
,
my
dear
--
and
after
you
'd
had
her
twice
*NL*
at
Skuytercliff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
point
that
Mr.
Jackson
seized
the
chance
to
place
his
*NL*
favourite
allusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Tuileries
,
''
he
repeated
,
seeing
the
eyes
of
the
company
*NL*
expectantly
turned
on
him
,
``
the
standard
was
excessively
lax
in
some
*NL*
respects
;
and
if
you
'd
asked
where
Morny
's
money
came
from
--
!
Or
who
*NL*
paid
the
debts
of
some
of
the
Court
beauties
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
dear
Sillerton
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
,
``
you
are
not
suggesting
*NL*
that
we
should
adopt
such
standards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
suggest
,
''
returned
Mr.
Jackson
imperturbably
.
``
But
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
's
foreign
bringing-up
may
make
her
less
particular
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
the
two
elder
ladies
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
to
have
kept
her
grandmother
's
carriage
at
a
defaulter
's
door
!
''
*NL*
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
protested
;
and
Archer
guessed
that
he
was
*NL*
remembering
,
and
resenting
,
the
hampers
of
carnations
he
had
sent
to
*NL*
the
little
house
in
Twenty-third
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
've
always
said
that
she
looks
at
things
quite
*NL*
differently
,
''
Mrs.
Archer
summed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
rose
to
May
's
forehead
.
She
looked
across
the
table
at
her
*NL*
husband
,
and
said
precipitately
:
``
I
'm
sure
Ellen
meant
it
kindly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imprudent
people
are
often
kind
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
,
as
if
the
fact
*NL*
were
scarcely
an
extenuation
;
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
murmured
:
``
If
*NL*
only
she
had
consulted
some
one
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
she
never
did
!
''
Mrs.
Archer
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
glanced
at
his
wife
,
who
bent
her
head
*NL*
slightly
in
the
direction
of
Mrs.
Archer
;
and
the
glimmering
trains
of
*NL*
the
three
ladies
swept
out
of
the
door
while
the
gentlemen
settled
down
*NL*
to
their
cigars
.
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
supplied
short
ones
on
Opera
*NL*
nights
;
but
they
were
so
good
that
they
made
his
guests
deplore
his
*NL*
inexorable
punctuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
after
the
first
act
,
had
detached
himself
from
the
party
and
*NL*
made
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
club
box
.
From
there
he
watched
,
over
*NL*
various
Chivers
,
Mingott
and
Rushworth
shoulders
,
the
same
scene
that
*NL*
he
had
looked
at
,
two
years
previously
,
on
the
night
of
his
first
*NL*
meeting
with
Ellen
Olenska
.
He
had
half-expected
her
to
appear
again
*NL*
in
old
Mrs.
Mingott
's
box
,
but
it
remained
empty
;
and
he
sat
*NL*
motionless
,
his
eyes
fastened
on
it
,
till
suddenly
Madame
Nilsson
's
*NL*
pure
soprano
broke
out
into
``
M'ama
,
non
m
`
ama
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
turned
to
the
stage
,
where
,
in
the
familiar
setting
of
giant
*NL*
roses
and
pen-wiper
pansies
,
the
same
large
blonde
victim
was
*NL*
succumbing
to
the
same
small
brown
seducer
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
stage
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
point
of
the
horseshoe
where
*NL*
May
sat
between
two
older
ladies
,
just
as
,
on
that
former
evening
,
she
*NL*
had
sat
between
Mrs.
Lovell
Mingott
and
her
newly-arrived
``
foreign
''
*NL*
cousin
.
As
on
that
evening
,
she
was
all
in
white
;
and
Archer
,
who
had
*NL*
not
noticed
what
she
wore
,
recognised
the
blue-white
satin
and
old
lace
*NL*
of
her
wedding
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
custom
,
in
old
New
York
,
for
brides
to
appear
in
this
costly
*NL*
garment
during
the
first
year
or
two
of
marriage
:
his
mother
,
he
knew
,
*NL*
kept
hers
in
tissue
paper
in
the
hope
that
Janey
might
some
day
wear
*NL*
it
,
though
poor
Janey
was
reaching
the
age
when
pearl
grey
poplin
and
*NL*
no
bridesmaids
would
be
thought
more
``
appropriate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
Archer
that
May
,
since
their
return
from
Europe
,
had
seldom
*NL*
worn
her
bridal
satin
,
and
the
surprise
of
seeing
her
in
it
made
him
*NL*
compare
her
appearance
with
that
of
the
young
girl
he
had
watched
with
*NL*
such
blissful
anticipations
two
years
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
May
's
outline
was
slightly
heavier
,
as
her
goddesslike
build
had
*NL*
foretold
,
her
athletic
erectness
of
carriage
,
and
the
girlish
*NL*
transparency
of
her
expression
,
remained
unchanged
:
but
for
the
slight
*NL*
languor
that
Archer
had
lately
noticed
in
her
she
would
have
been
the
*NL*
exact
image
of
the
girl
playing
with
the
bouquet
of
*NL*
lilies-of-the-valley
on
her
betrothal
evening
.
The
fact
seemed
an
*NL*
additional
appeal
to
his
pity
:
such
innocence
was
as
moving
as
the
*NL*
trustful
clasp
of
a
child
.
Then
he
remembered
the
passionate
*NL*
generosity
latent
under
that
incurious
calm
.
He
recalled
her
glance
of
*NL*
understanding
when
he
had
urged
that
their
engagement
should
be
*NL*
announced
at
the
Beaufort
ball
;
he
heard
the
voice
in
which
she
had
*NL*
said
,
in
the
Mission
garden
:
``
I
could
n't
have
my
happiness
made
out
of
*NL*
a
wrong
--
a
wrong
to
some
one
else
;
''
and
an
uncontrollable
longing
*NL*
seized
him
to
tell
her
the
truth
,
to
throw
himself
on
her
generosity
,
*NL*
and
ask
for
the
freedom
he
had
once
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
was
a
quiet
and
self-controlled
young
man
.
Conformity
*NL*
to
the
discipline
of
a
small
society
had
become
almost
his
second
*NL*
nature
.
It
was
deeply
distasteful
to
him
to
do
anything
melodramatic
*NL*
and
conspicuous
,
anything
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
would
have
deprecated
and
*NL*
the
club
box
condemned
as
bad
form
.
But
he
had
become
suddenly
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
club
box
,
of
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
,
of
all
that
had
so
*NL*
long
enclosed
him
in
the
warm
shelter
of
habit
.
He
walked
along
the
*NL*
semi-circular
passage
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
opened
the
door
of
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
box
as
if
it
had
been
a
gate
into
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M'ama
!
''
thrilled
out
the
triumphant
Marguerite
;
and
the
occupants
of
*NL*
the
box
looked
up
in
surprise
at
Archer
's
entrance
.
He
had
already
*NL*
broken
one
of
the
rules
of
his
world
,
which
forbade
the
entering
of
a
*NL*
box
during
a
solo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slipping
between
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
and
Sillerton
Jackson
,
he
leaned
*NL*
over
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
beastly
headache
;
do
n't
tell
any
one
,
but
come
home
,
wo
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
gave
him
a
glance
of
comprehension
,
and
he
saw
her
whisper
to
his
*NL*
mother
,
who
nodded
sympathetically
;
then
she
murmured
an
excuse
to
Mrs.
*NL*
van
der
Luyden
,
and
rose
from
her
seat
just
as
Marguerite
fell
into
*NL*
Faust
's
arms
.
Archer
,
while
he
helped
her
on
with
her
Opera
cloak
,
*NL*
noticed
the
exchange
of
a
significant
smile
between
the
older
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drove
away
May
laid
her
hand
shyly
on
his
.
``
I
'm
so
sorry
you
*NL*
do
n't
feel
well
.
I
'm
afraid
they
've
been
overworking
you
again
at
the
*NL*
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
's
not
that
:
do
you
mind
if
I
open
the
window
?
''
he
returned
*NL*
confusedly
,
letting
down
the
pane
on
his
side
.
He
sat
staring
out
into
*NL*
the
street
,
feeling
his
wife
beside
him
as
a
silent
watchful
*NL*
interrogation
,
and
keeping
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
passing
*NL*
houses
.
At
their
door
she
caught
her
skirt
in
the
step
of
the
*NL*
carriage
,
and
fell
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hurt
yourself
?
''
he
asked
,
steadying
her
with
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
my
poor
dress
--
see
how
I
've
torn
it
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
She
bent
*NL*
to
gather
up
a
mud-stained
breadth
,
and
followed
him
up
the
steps
into
*NL*
the
hall
.
The
servants
had
not
expected
them
so
early
,
and
there
was
*NL*
only
a
glimmer
of
gas
on
the
upper
landing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
mounted
the
stairs
,
turned
up
the
light
,
and
put
a
match
to
the
*NL*
brackets
on
each
side
of
the
library
mantelpiece
.
The
curtains
were
*NL*
drawn
,
and
the
warm
friendly
aspect
of
the
room
smote
him
like
that
of
*NL*
a
familiar
face
met
during
an
unavowable
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
noticed
that
his
wife
was
very
pale
,
and
asked
if
he
should
get
her
*NL*
some
brandy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
exclaimed
with
a
momentary
flush
,
as
she
took
off
her
*NL*
cloak
.
``
But
had
n't
you
better
go
to
bed
at
once
?
''
she
added
,
as
he
*NL*
opened
a
silver
box
on
the
table
and
took
out
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
threw
down
the
cigarette
and
walked
to
his
usual
place
by
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
my
head
is
not
as
bad
as
that
.
''
He
paused
.
``
And
there
's
*NL*
something
I
want
to
say
;
something
important
--
that
I
must
tell
you
at
*NL*
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
dropped
into
an
armchair
,
and
raised
her
head
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
?
''
she
rejoined
,
so
gently
that
he
wondered
at
the
lack
of
*NL*
wonder
with
which
she
received
this
preamble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
--
''
he
began
,
standing
a
few
feet
from
her
chair
,
and
looking
over
*NL*
at
her
as
if
the
slight
distance
between
them
were
an
unbridgeable
*NL*
abyss
.
The
sound
of
his
voice
echoed
uncannily
through
the
homelike
*NL*
hush
,
and
he
repeated
:
``
There
is
something
I
've
got
to
tell
you
...
*NL*
about
myself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
silent
,
without
a
movement
or
a
tremor
of
her
lashes
.
She
was
*NL*
still
extremely
pale
,
but
her
face
had
a
curious
tranquillity
of
*NL*
expression
that
seemed
drawn
from
some
secret
inner
source
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
checked
the
conventional
phrases
of
self-accusal
that
were
*NL*
crowding
to
his
lips
.
He
was
determined
to
put
the
case
baldly
,
*NL*
without
vain
recrimination
or
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Olenska
--
''
he
said
;
but
at
the
name
his
wife
raised
her
hand
as
*NL*
if
to
silence
him
.
As
she
did
so
the
gaslight
struck
on
the
gold
of
*NL*
her
wedding-ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
should
we
talk
about
Ellen
tonight
?
''
she
asked
,
with
a
slight
*NL*
pout
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
ought
to
have
spoken
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
remained
calm
.
``
Is
it
really
worth
while
,
dear
?
I
know
I
've
*NL*
been
unfair
to
her
at
times
--
perhaps
we
all
have
.
You
've
understood
*NL*
her
,
no
doubt
,
better
than
we
did
:
you
've
always
been
kind
to
her
.
But
*NL*
what
does
it
matter
,
now
it
's
all
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
looked
at
her
blankly
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
the
sense
of
*NL*
unreality
in
which
he
felt
himself
imprisoned
had
communicated
itself
*NL*
to
his
wife
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
over
--
what
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
in
an
indistinct
stammer
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
still
looked
at
him
with
transparent
eyes
.
``
Why
--
since
she
's
going
*NL*
back
to
Europe
so
soon
;
since
Granny
approves
and
understands
,
and
has
*NL*
arranged
to
make
her
independent
of
her
husband
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
broke
off
,
and
Archer
,
grasping
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
in
*NL*
one
convulsed
hand
,
and
steadying
himself
against
it
,
made
a
vain
*NL*
effort
to
extend
the
same
control
to
his
reeling
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
supposed
,
''
he
heard
his
wife
's
even
voice
go
on
,
``
that
you
had
been
*NL*
kept
at
the
office
this
evening
about
the
business
arrangements
.
It
*NL*
was
settled
this
morning
,
I
believe
.
''
She
lowered
her
eyes
under
his
*NL*
unseeing
stare
,
and
another
fugitive
flush
passed
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
understood
that
his
own
eyes
must
be
unbearable
,
and
turning
away
,
*NL*
rested
his
elbows
on
the
mantel-shelf
and
covered
his
face
.
Something
*NL*
drummed
and
clanged
furiously
in
his
ears
;
he
could
not
tell
if
it
were
*NL*
the
blood
in
his
veins
,
or
the
tick
of
the
clock
on
the
mantel
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
sat
without
moving
or
speaking
while
the
clock
slowly
measured
out
*NL*
five
minutes
.
A
lump
of
coal
fell
forward
in
the
grate
,
and
hearing
*NL*
her
rise
to
push
it
back
,
Archer
at
length
turned
and
faced
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
--
what
you
've
just
told
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
Ellen
yesterday
--
I
told
you
I
'd
seen
her
at
Granny
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
then
that
she
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
had
a
note
from
her
this
afternoon
.
--
Do
you
want
to
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
find
his
voice
,
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
,
and
came
*NL*
back
almost
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
knew
,
''
she
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
a
sheet
of
paper
on
the
table
,
and
Archer
put
out
his
hand
and
*NL*
took
it
up
.
The
letter
contained
only
a
few
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
dear
,
I
have
at
last
made
Granny
understand
that
my
visit
to
her
*NL*
could
be
no
more
than
a
visit
;
and
she
has
been
as
kind
and
generous
as
*NL*
ever
.
She
sees
now
that
if
I
return
to
Europe
I
must
live
by
myself
,
*NL*
or
rather
with
poor
Aunt
Medora
,
who
is
coming
with
me
.
I
am
hurrying
*NL*
back
to
Washington
to
pack
up
,
and
we
sail
next
week
.
You
must
be
very
*NL*
good
to
Granny
when
I
'm
gone
--
as
good
as
you
've
always
been
to
me
.
*NL*
Ellen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
any
of
my
friends
wish
to
urge
me
to
change
my
mind
,
please
tell
*NL*
them
it
would
be
utterly
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
read
the
letter
over
two
or
three
times
;
then
he
flung
it
down
*NL*
and
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
his
laugh
startled
him
.
It
recalled
Janey
's
midnight
*NL*
fright
when
she
had
caught
him
rocking
with
incomprehensible
mirth
over
*NL*
May
's
telegram
announcing
that
the
date
of
their
marriage
had
been
*NL*
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
she
write
this
?
''
he
asked
,
checking
his
laugh
with
a
supreme
*NL*
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
met
the
question
with
her
unshaken
candour
.
``
I
suppose
because
we
*NL*
talked
things
over
yesterday
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
her
I
was
afraid
I
had
n't
been
fair
to
her
--
had
n't
always
*NL*
understood
how
hard
it
must
have
been
for
her
here
,
alone
among
so
many
*NL*
people
who
were
relations
and
yet
strangers
;
who
felt
the
right
to
*NL*
criticise
,
and
yet
did
n't
always
know
the
circumstances
.
''
She
paused
.
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
'd
been
the
one
friend
she
could
always
count
on
;
and
I
*NL*
wanted
her
to
know
that
you
and
I
were
the
same
--
in
all
our
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
,
as
if
waiting
for
him
to
speak
,
and
then
added
slowly
:
*NL*
``
She
understood
my
wishing
to
tell
her
this
.
I
think
she
understands
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
Archer
,
and
taking
one
of
his
cold
hands
pressed
it
*NL*
quickly
against
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
aches
too
;
good-night
,
dear
,
''
she
said
,
and
turned
to
the
*NL*
door
,
her
torn
and
muddy
wedding-dress
dragging
after
her
across
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
as
Mrs.
Archer
smilingly
said
to
Mrs.
Welland
,
a
great
event
*NL*
for
a
young
couple
to
give
their
first
big
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Newland
Archers
,
since
they
had
set
up
their
household
,
had
*NL*
received
a
good
deal
of
company
in
an
informal
way
.
Archer
was
fond
of
*NL*
having
three
or
four
friends
to
dine
,
and
May
welcomed
them
with
the
*NL*
beaming
readiness
of
which
her
mother
had
set
her
the
example
in
*NL*
conjugal
affairs
.
Her
husband
questioned
whether
,
if
left
to
herself
,
*NL*
she
would
ever
have
asked
any
one
to
the
house
;
but
he
had
long
given
*NL*
up
trying
to
disengage
her
real
self
from
the
shape
into
which
*NL*
tradition
and
training
had
moulded
her
.
It
was
expected
that
well-off
*NL*
young
couples
in
New
York
should
do
a
good
deal
of
informal
*NL*
entertaining
,
and
a
Welland
married
to
an
Archer
was
doubly
pledged
to
*NL*
the
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
big
dinner
,
with
a
hired
chef
and
two
borrowed
footmen
,
with
*NL*
Roman
punch
,
roses
from
Henderson
's
,
and
menus
on
gilt-edged
cards
,
was
*NL*
a
different
affair
,
and
not
to
be
lightly
undertaken
.
As
Mrs.
Archer
*NL*
remarked
,
the
Roman
punch
made
all
the
difference
;
not
in
itself
but
by
*NL*
its
manifold
implications
--
since
it
signified
either
canvas-backs
or
*NL*
terrapin
,
two
soups
,
a
hot
and
a
cold
sweet
,
full
decolletage
with
*NL*
short
sleeves
,
and
guests
of
a
proportionate
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
an
interesting
occasion
when
a
young
pair
launched
their
*NL*
first
invitations
in
the
third
person
,
and
their
summons
was
seldom
*NL*
refused
even
by
the
seasoned
and
sought-after
.
Still
,
it
was
*NL*
admittedly
a
triumph
that
the
van
der
Luydens
,
at
May
's
request
,
should
*NL*
have
stayed
over
in
order
to
be
present
at
her
farewell
dinner
for
the
*NL*
Countess
Olenska
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
mothers-in-law
sat
in
May
's
drawing-room
on
the
afternoon
of
*NL*
the
great
day
,
Mrs.
Archer
writing
out
the
menus
on
Tiffany
's
thickest
*NL*
gilt-edged
bristol
,
while
Mrs.
Welland
superintended
the
placing
of
the
*NL*
palms
and
standard
lamps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
arriving
late
from
his
office
,
found
them
still
there
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Archer
had
turned
her
attention
to
the
name-cards
for
the
table
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
was
considering
the
effect
of
bringing
forward
the
large
*NL*
gilt
sofa
,
so
that
another
``
corner
''
might
be
created
between
the
piano
*NL*
and
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
,
they
told
him
,
was
in
the
dining-room
inspecting
the
mound
of
*NL*
Jacqueminot
roses
and
maidenhair
in
the
centre
of
the
long
table
,
and
*NL*
the
placing
of
the
Maillard
bonbons
in
openwork
silver
baskets
between
*NL*
the
candelabra
.
On
the
piano
stood
a
large
basket
of
orchids
which
Mr.
*NL*
van
der
Luyden
had
had
sent
from
Skuytercliff
.
Everything
was
,
in
*NL*
short
,
as
it
should
be
on
the
approach
of
so
considerable
an
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Archer
ran
thoughtfully
over
the
list
,
checking
off
each
name
with
*NL*
her
sharp
gold
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henry
van
der
Luyden
--
Louisa
--
the
Lovell
Mingotts
--
the
Reggie
*NL*
Chiverses
--
Lawrence
Lefferts
and
Gertrude
--
-LRB-
yes
,
I
suppose
May
was
*NL*
right
to
have
them
-RRB-
--
the
Selfridge
Merrys
,
Sillerton
Jackson
,
Van
*NL*
Newland
and
his
wife
.
-LRB-
How
time
passes
!
It
seems
only
yesterday
that
*NL*
he
was
your
best
man
,
Newland
-RRB-
--
and
Countess
Olenska
--
yes
,
I
think
*NL*
that
's
all
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Welland
surveyed
her
son-in-law
affectionately
.
``
No
one
can
say
,
*NL*
Newland
,
that
you
and
May
are
not
giving
Ellen
a
handsome
send-off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Archer
,
``
I
understand
May
's
wanting
her
cousin
to
*NL*
tell
people
abroad
that
we
're
not
quite
barbarians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
Ellen
will
appreciate
it
.
She
was
to
arrive
this
morning
,
I
*NL*
believe
.
It
will
make
a
most
charming
last
impression
.
The
evening
*NL*
before
sailing
is
usually
so
dreary
,
''
Mrs.
Welland
cheerfully
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
turned
toward
the
door
,
and
his
mother-in-law
called
to
him
:
*NL*
``
Do
go
in
and
have
a
peep
at
the
table
.
And
do
n't
let
May
tire
herself
*NL*
too
much
.
''
But
he
affected
not
to
hear
,
and
sprang
up
the
stairs
to
*NL*
his
library
.
The
room
looked
at
him
like
an
alien
countenance
composed
*NL*
into
a
polite
grimace
;
and
he
perceived
that
it
had
been
ruthlessly
*NL*
``
tidied
,
''
and
prepared
,
by
a
judicious
distribution
of
ash-trays
and
*NL*
cedar-wood
boxes
,
for
the
gentlemen
to
smoke
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
he
thought
,
``
it
's
not
for
long
--
''
and
he
went
on
to
his
*NL*
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
days
had
passed
since
Madame
Olenska
's
departure
from
New
York
.
*NL*
During
those
ten
days
Archer
had
had
no
sign
from
her
but
that
conveyed
*NL*
by
the
return
of
a
key
wrapped
in
tissue
paper
,
and
sent
to
his
office
*NL*
in
a
sealed
envelope
addressed
in
her
hand
.
This
retort
to
his
last
*NL*
appeal
might
have
been
interpreted
as
a
classic
move
in
a
familiar
*NL*
game
;
but
the
young
man
chose
to
give
it
a
different
meaning
.
She
was
*NL*
still
fighting
against
her
fate
;
but
she
was
going
to
Europe
,
and
she
*NL*
was
not
returning
to
her
husband
.
Nothing
,
therefore
,
was
to
prevent
*NL*
his
following
her
;
and
once
he
had
taken
the
irrevocable
step
,
and
had
*NL*
proved
to
her
that
it
was
irrevocable
,
he
believed
she
would
not
send
*NL*
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confidence
in
the
future
had
steadied
him
to
play
his
part
in
the
*NL*
present
.
It
had
kept
him
from
writing
to
her
,
or
betraying
,
by
any
*NL*
sign
or
act
,
his
misery
and
mortification
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
in
*NL*
the
deadly
silent
game
between
them
the
trumps
were
still
in
his
hands
;
*NL*
and
he
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
,
nevertheless
,
moments
sufficiently
difficult
to
pass
;
*NL*
as
when
Mr.
Letterblair
,
the
day
after
Madame
Olenska
's
departure
,
had
*NL*
sent
for
him
to
go
over
the
details
of
the
trust
which
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
wished
to
create
for
her
granddaughter
.
For
a
couple
of
hours
*NL*
Archer
had
examined
the
terms
of
the
deed
with
his
senior
,
all
the
*NL*
while
obscurely
feeling
that
if
he
had
been
consulted
it
was
for
some
*NL*
reason
other
than
the
obvious
one
of
his
cousinship
;
and
that
the
close
*NL*
of
the
conference
would
reveal
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
lady
ca
n't
deny
that
it
's
a
handsome
arrangement
,
''
Mr.
*NL*
Letterblair
had
summed
up
,
after
mumbling
over
a
summary
of
the
*NL*
settlement
.
``
In
fact
I
'm
bound
to
say
she
's
been
treated
pretty
*NL*
handsomely
all
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
round
?
''
Archer
echoed
with
a
touch
of
derision
.
``
Do
you
refer
to
*NL*
her
husband
's
proposal
to
give
her
back
her
own
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
's
bushy
eyebrows
went
up
a
fraction
of
an
inch
.
``
My
*NL*
dear
sir
,
the
law
's
the
law
;
and
your
wife
's
cousin
was
married
under
*NL*
the
French
law
.
It
's
to
be
presumed
she
knew
what
that
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
she
did
,
what
happened
subsequently
--
.
''
But
Archer
paused
.
*NL*
Mr.
Letterblair
had
laid
his
pen-handle
against
his
big
corrugated
*NL*
nose
,
and
was
looking
down
it
with
the
expression
assumed
by
virtuous
*NL*
elderly
gentlemen
when
they
wish
their
youngers
to
understand
that
*NL*
virtue
is
not
synonymous
with
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
I
've
no
wish
to
extenuate
the
Count
's
transgressions
;
*NL*
but
--
but
on
the
other
side
...
I
would
n't
put
my
hand
in
the
fire
...
*NL*
well
,
that
there
had
n't
been
tit
for
tat
...
with
the
young
*NL*
champion
...
''
Mr.
Letterblair
unlocked
a
drawer
and
pushed
a
folded
*NL*
paper
toward
Archer
.
``
This
report
,
the
result
of
discreet
enquiries
*NL*
...
''
And
then
,
as
Archer
made
no
effort
to
glance
at
the
paper
or
to
*NL*
repudiate
the
suggestion
,
the
lawyer
somewhat
flatly
continued
:
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
it
's
conclusive
,
you
observe
;
far
from
it
.
But
straws
show
*NL*
...
and
on
the
whole
it
's
eminently
satisfactory
for
all
parties
that
*NL*
this
dignified
solution
has
been
reached
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
eminently
,
''
Archer
assented
,
pushing
back
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
later
,
on
responding
to
a
summons
from
Mrs.
Manson
*NL*
Mingott
,
his
soul
had
been
more
deeply
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
found
the
old
lady
depressed
and
querulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
she
's
deserted
me
?
''
she
began
at
once
;
and
without
waiting
*NL*
for
his
reply
:
``
Oh
,
do
n't
ask
me
why
!
She
gave
so
many
reasons
that
*NL*
I
've
forgotten
them
all
.
My
private
belief
is
that
she
could
n't
face
*NL*
the
boredom
.
At
any
rate
that
's
what
Augusta
and
my
daughters-in-law
*NL*
think
.
And
I
do
n't
know
that
I
altogether
blame
her
.
Olenski
's
a
*NL*
finished
scoundrel
;
but
life
with
him
must
have
been
a
good
deal
gayer
*NL*
than
it
is
in
Fifth
Avenue
.
Not
that
the
family
would
admit
that
:
they
*NL*
think
Fifth
Avenue
is
Heaven
with
the
rue
de
la
Paix
thrown
in
.
And
*NL*
poor
Ellen
,
of
course
,
has
no
idea
of
going
back
to
her
husband
.
She
*NL*
held
out
as
firmly
as
ever
against
that
.
So
she
's
to
settle
down
in
*NL*
Paris
with
that
fool
Medora
...
Well
,
Paris
is
Paris
;
and
you
can
keep
*NL*
a
carriage
there
on
next
to
nothing
.
But
she
was
as
gay
as
a
bird
,
and
*NL*
I
shall
miss
her
.
''
Two
tears
,
the
parched
tears
of
the
old
,
rolled
down
*NL*
her
puffy
cheeks
and
vanished
in
the
abysses
of
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
ask
is
,
''
she
concluded
,
``
that
they
should
n't
bother
me
any
more
.
*NL*
I
must
really
be
allowed
to
digest
my
gruel
...
''
And
she
twinkled
a
*NL*
little
wistfully
at
Archer
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
that
evening
,
on
his
return
home
,
that
May
announced
her
*NL*
intention
of
giving
a
farewell
dinner
to
her
cousin
.
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
name
had
not
been
pronounced
between
them
since
the
night
of
her
flight
*NL*
to
Washington
;
and
Archer
looked
at
his
wife
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dinner
--
why
?
''
he
interrogated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
colour
rose
.
``
But
you
like
Ellen
--
I
thought
you
'd
be
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
awfully
nice
--
your
putting
it
in
that
way
.
But
I
really
do
n't
*NL*
see
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
do
it
,
Newland
,
''
she
said
,
quietly
rising
and
going
to
her
*NL*
desk
.
``
Here
are
the
invitations
all
written
.
Mother
helped
me
--
she
*NL*
agrees
that
we
ought
to
.
''
She
paused
,
embarrassed
and
yet
smiling
,
and
*NL*
Archer
suddenly
saw
before
him
the
embodied
image
of
the
Family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
''
he
said
,
staring
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
list
of
*NL*
guests
that
she
had
put
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
the
drawing-room
before
dinner
May
was
stooping
over
*NL*
the
fire
and
trying
to
coax
the
logs
to
burn
in
their
unaccustomed
*NL*
setting
of
immaculate
tiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tall
lamps
were
all
lit
,
and
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
's
orchids
had
been
*NL*
conspicuously
disposed
in
various
receptacles
of
modern
porcelain
and
*NL*
knobby
silver
.
Mrs.
Newland
Archer
's
drawing-room
was
generally
*NL*
thought
a
great
success
.
A
gilt
bamboo
jardiniere
,
in
which
the
*NL*
primulas
and
cinerarias
were
punctually
renewed
,
blocked
the
access
to
*NL*
the
bay
window
-LRB-
where
the
old-fashioned
would
have
preferred
a
bronze
*NL*
reduction
of
the
Venus
of
Milo
-RRB-
;
the
sofas
and
arm-chairs
of
pale
*NL*
brocade
were
cleverly
grouped
about
little
plush
tables
densely
covered
*NL*
with
silver
toys
,
porcelain
animals
and
efflorescent
photograph
frames
;
*NL*
and
tall
rosy-shaded
lamps
shot
up
like
tropical
flowers
among
the
*NL*
palms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
Ellen
has
ever
seen
this
room
lighted
up
,
''
said
May
,
*NL*
rising
flushed
from
her
struggle
,
and
sending
about
her
a
glance
of
*NL*
pardonable
pride
.
The
brass
tongs
which
she
had
propped
against
the
*NL*
side
of
the
chimney
fell
with
a
crash
that
drowned
her
husband
's
*NL*
answer
;
and
before
he
could
restore
them
Mr.
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
*NL*
were
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
guests
quickly
followed
,
for
it
was
known
that
the
van
der
*NL*
Luydens
liked
to
dine
punctually
.
The
room
was
nearly
full
,
and
Archer
*NL*
was
engaged
in
showing
to
Mrs.
Selfridge
Merry
a
small
highly-varnished
*NL*
Verbeckhoven
``
Study
of
Sheep
,
''
which
Mr.
Welland
had
given
May
for
*NL*
Christmas
,
when
he
found
Madame
Olenska
at
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
excessively
pale
,
and
her
pallor
made
her
dark
hair
seem
denser
*NL*
and
heavier
than
ever
.
Perhaps
that
,
or
the
fact
that
she
had
wound
*NL*
several
rows
of
amber
beads
about
her
neck
,
reminded
him
suddenly
of
*NL*
the
little
Ellen
Mingott
he
had
danced
with
at
children
's
parties
,
when
*NL*
Medora
Manson
had
first
brought
her
to
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
amber
beads
were
trying
to
her
complexion
,
or
her
dress
was
perhaps
*NL*
unbecoming
:
her
face
looked
lustreless
and
almost
ugly
,
and
he
had
*NL*
never
loved
it
as
he
did
at
that
minute
.
Their
hands
met
,
and
he
*NL*
thought
he
heard
her
say
:
``
Yes
,
we
're
sailing
tomorrow
in
the
*NL*
Russia
--
''
;
then
there
was
an
unmeaning
noise
of
opening
doors
,
and
*NL*
after
an
interval
May
's
voice
:
``
Newland
!
Dinner
's
been
announced
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
you
please
take
Ellen
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
and
he
noticed
that
the
hand
*NL*
was
ungloved
,
and
remembered
how
he
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
it
the
*NL*
evening
that
he
had
sat
with
her
in
the
little
Twenty-third
Street
*NL*
drawing-room
.
All
the
beauty
that
had
forsaken
her
face
seemed
to
have
*NL*
taken
refuge
in
the
long
pale
fingers
and
faintly
dimpled
knuckles
on
*NL*
his
sleeve
,
and
he
said
to
himself
:
``
If
it
were
only
to
see
her
hand
*NL*
again
I
should
have
to
follow
her
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
at
an
entertainment
ostensibly
offered
to
a
``
foreign
*NL*
visitor
''
that
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
could
suffer
the
diminution
of
being
*NL*
placed
on
her
host
's
left
.
The
fact
of
Madame
Olenska
's
``
foreignness
''
*NL*
could
hardly
have
been
more
adroitly
emphasised
than
by
this
farewell
*NL*
tribute
;
and
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
accepted
her
displacement
with
an
*NL*
affability
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
approval
.
There
were
certain
*NL*
things
that
had
to
be
done
,
and
if
done
at
all
,
done
handsomely
and
*NL*
thoroughly
;
and
one
of
these
,
in
the
old
New
York
code
,
was
the
tribal
*NL*
rally
around
a
kinswoman
about
to
be
eliminated
from
the
tribe
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
on
earth
that
the
Wellands
and
Mingotts
would
not
have
done
*NL*
to
proclaim
their
unalterable
affection
for
the
Countess
Olenska
now
*NL*
that
her
passage
for
Europe
was
engaged
;
and
Archer
,
at
the
head
of
his
*NL*
table
,
sat
marvelling
at
the
silent
untiring
activity
with
which
her
*NL*
popularity
had
been
retrieved
,
grievances
against
her
silenced
,
her
*NL*
past
countenanced
,
and
her
present
irradiated
by
the
family
approval
.
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
shone
on
her
with
the
dim
benevolence
which
was
her
*NL*
nearest
approach
to
cordiality
,
and
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
,
from
his
seat
*NL*
at
May
's
right
,
cast
down
the
table
glances
plainly
intended
to
justify
*NL*
all
the
carnations
he
had
sent
from
Skuytercliff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
who
seemed
to
be
assisting
at
the
scene
in
a
state
of
odd
*NL*
imponderability
,
as
if
he
floated
somewhere
between
chandelier
and
*NL*
ceiling
,
wondered
at
nothing
so
much
as
his
own
share
in
the
*NL*
proceedings
.
As
his
glance
travelled
from
one
placid
well-fed
face
to
*NL*
another
he
saw
all
the
harmless-looking
people
engaged
upon
May
's
*NL*
canvas-backs
as
a
band
of
dumb
conspirators
,
and
himself
and
the
pale
*NL*
woman
on
his
right
as
the
centre
of
their
conspiracy
.
And
then
it
came
*NL*
over
him
,
in
a
vast
flash
made
up
of
many
broken
gleams
,
that
to
all
of
*NL*
them
he
and
Madame
Olenska
were
lovers
,
lovers
in
the
extreme
sense
*NL*
peculiar
to
``
foreign
''
vocabularies
.
He
guessed
himself
to
have
been
,
*NL*
for
months
,
the
centre
of
countless
silently
observing
eyes
and
*NL*
patiently
listening
ears
;
he
understood
that
,
by
means
as
yet
unknown
*NL*
to
him
,
the
separation
between
himself
and
the
partner
of
his
guilt
had
*NL*
been
achieved
,
and
that
now
the
whole
tribe
had
rallied
about
his
wife
*NL*
on
the
tacit
assumption
that
nobody
knew
anything
,
or
had
ever
imagined
*NL*
anything
,
and
that
the
occasion
of
the
entertainment
was
simply
May
*NL*
Archer
's
natural
desire
to
take
an
affectionate
leave
of
her
friend
and
*NL*
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
old
New
York
way
of
taking
life
``
without
effusion
of
blood
''
:
*NL*
the
way
of
people
who
dreaded
scandal
more
than
disease
,
who
placed
*NL*
decency
above
courage
,
and
who
considered
that
nothing
was
more
*NL*
ill-bred
than
``
scenes
,
''
except
the
behaviour
of
those
who
gave
rise
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
thoughts
succeeded
each
other
in
his
mind
Archer
felt
like
a
*NL*
prisoner
in
the
centre
of
an
armed
camp
.
He
looked
about
the
table
,
*NL*
and
guessed
at
the
inexorableness
of
his
captors
from
the
tone
in
*NL*
which
,
over
the
asparagus
from
Florida
,
they
were
dealing
with
Beaufort
*NL*
and
his
wife
.
``
It
's
to
show
me
,
''
he
thought
,
``
what
would
happen
to
*NL*
ME
--
''
and
a
deathly
sense
of
the
superiority
of
implication
and
analogy
*NL*
over
direct
action
,
and
of
silence
over
rash
words
,
closed
in
on
him
*NL*
like
the
doors
of
the
family
vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
and
met
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
's
startled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
it
laughable
?
''
she
said
with
a
pinched
smile
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
poor
Regina
's
idea
of
remaining
in
New
York
has
its
ridiculous
side
,
I
*NL*
suppose
;
''
and
Archer
muttered
:
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
,
he
became
conscious
that
Madame
Olenska
's
other
*NL*
neighbour
had
been
engaged
for
some
time
with
the
lady
on
his
right
.
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
he
saw
that
May
,
serenely
enthroned
between
Mr.
van
*NL*
der
Luyden
and
Mr.
Selfridge
Merry
,
had
cast
a
quick
glance
down
the
*NL*
table
.
It
was
evident
that
the
host
and
the
lady
on
his
right
could
*NL*
not
sit
through
the
whole
meal
in
silence
.
He
turned
to
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
,
and
her
pale
smile
met
him
.
``
Oh
,
do
let
's
see
it
through
,
''
it
*NL*
seemed
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
find
the
journey
tiring
?
''
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
surprised
*NL*
him
by
its
naturalness
;
and
she
answered
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
she
had
*NL*
seldom
travelled
with
fewer
discomforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
,
you
know
,
the
dreadful
heat
in
the
train
,
''
she
added
;
and
he
*NL*
remarked
that
she
would
not
suffer
from
that
particular
hardship
in
the
*NL*
country
she
was
going
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
,
''
he
declared
with
intensity
,
``
was
more
nearly
frozen
than
*NL*
once
,
in
April
,
in
the
train
between
Calais
and
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
she
did
not
wonder
,
but
remarked
that
,
after
all
,
one
could
*NL*
always
carry
an
extra
rug
,
and
that
every
form
of
travel
had
its
*NL*
hardships
;
to
which
he
abruptly
returned
that
he
thought
them
all
of
no
*NL*
account
compared
with
the
blessedness
of
getting
away
.
She
changed
*NL*
colour
,
and
he
added
,
his
voice
suddenly
rising
in
pitch
:
``
I
mean
to
*NL*
do
a
lot
of
travelling
myself
before
long
.
''
A
tremor
crossed
her
face
,
*NL*
and
leaning
over
to
Reggie
Chivers
,
he
cried
out
:
``
I
say
,
Reggie
,
what
*NL*
do
you
say
to
a
trip
round
the
world
:
now
,
next
month
,
I
mean
?
I
'm
*NL*
game
if
you
are
--
''
at
which
Mrs.
Reggie
piped
up
that
she
could
not
*NL*
think
of
letting
Reggie
go
till
after
the
Martha
Washington
Ball
she
*NL*
was
getting
up
for
the
Blind
Asylum
in
Easter
week
;
and
her
husband
*NL*
placidly
observed
that
by
that
time
he
would
have
to
be
practising
for
*NL*
the
International
Polo
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Selfridge
Merry
had
caught
the
phrase
``
round
the
world
,
''
and
*NL*
having
once
circled
the
globe
in
his
steam-yacht
,
he
seized
the
*NL*
opportunity
to
send
down
the
table
several
striking
items
concerning
*NL*
the
shallowness
of
the
Mediterranean
ports
.
Though
,
after
all
,
he
*NL*
added
,
it
did
n't
matter
;
for
when
you
'd
seen
Athens
and
Smyrna
and
*NL*
Constantinople
,
what
else
was
there
?
And
Mrs.
Merry
said
she
could
*NL*
never
be
too
grateful
to
Dr.
Bencomb
for
having
made
them
promise
not
*NL*
to
go
to
Naples
on
account
of
the
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
have
three
weeks
to
do
India
properly
,
''
her
husband
*NL*
conceded
,
anxious
to
have
it
understood
that
he
was
no
frivolous
*NL*
globe-trotter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
point
the
ladies
went
up
to
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
library
,
in
spite
of
weightier
presences
,
Lawrence
Lefferts
*NL*
predominated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
,
as
usual
,
had
veered
around
to
the
Beauforts
,
and
even
Mr.
*NL*
van
der
Luyden
and
Mr.
Selfridge
Merry
,
installed
in
the
honorary
*NL*
arm-chairs
tacitly
reserved
for
them
,
paused
to
listen
to
the
younger
*NL*
man
's
philippic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Lefferts
so
abounded
in
the
sentiments
that
adorn
Christian
*NL*
manhood
and
exalt
the
sanctity
of
the
home
.
Indignation
lent
him
a
*NL*
scathing
eloquence
,
and
it
was
clear
that
if
others
had
followed
his
*NL*
example
,
and
acted
as
he
talked
,
society
would
never
have
been
weak
*NL*
enough
to
receive
a
foreign
upstart
like
Beaufort
--
no
,
sir
,
not
even
if
*NL*
he
'd
married
a
van
der
Luyden
or
a
Lanning
instead
of
a
Dallas
.
And
*NL*
what
chance
would
there
have
been
,
Lefferts
wrathfully
questioned
,
of
*NL*
his
marrying
into
such
a
family
as
the
Dallases
,
if
he
had
not
already
*NL*
wormed
his
way
into
certain
houses
,
as
people
like
Mrs.
Lemuel
*NL*
Struthers
had
managed
to
worm
theirs
in
his
wake
?
If
society
chose
to
*NL*
open
its
doors
to
vulgar
women
the
harm
was
not
great
,
though
the
gain
*NL*
was
doubtful
;
but
once
it
got
in
the
way
of
tolerating
men
of
obscure
*NL*
origin
and
tainted
wealth
the
end
was
total
disintegration
--
and
at
no
*NL*
distant
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
things
go
on
at
this
pace
,
''
Lefferts
thundered
,
looking
like
a
*NL*
young
prophet
dressed
by
Poole
,
and
who
had
not
yet
been
stoned
,
``
we
*NL*
shall
see
our
children
fighting
for
invitations
to
swindlers
'
houses
,
*NL*
and
marrying
Beaufort
's
bastards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
--
draw
it
mild
!
''
Reggie
Chivers
and
young
Newland
protested
,
*NL*
while
Mr.
Selfridge
Merry
looked
genuinely
alarmed
,
and
an
expression
*NL*
of
pain
and
disgust
settled
on
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
's
sensitive
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
got
any
?
''
cried
Mr.
Sillerton
Jackson
,
pricking
up
his
ears
;
*NL*
and
while
Lefferts
tried
to
turn
the
question
with
a
laugh
,
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
twittered
into
Archer
's
ear
:
``
Queer
,
those
fellows
who
are
*NL*
always
wanting
to
set
things
right
.
The
people
who
have
the
worst
*NL*
cooks
are
always
telling
you
they
're
poisoned
when
they
dine
out
.
But
*NL*
I
hear
there
are
pressing
reasons
for
our
friend
Lawrence
's
*NL*
diatribe
:
--
typewriter
this
time
,
I
understand
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
swept
past
Archer
like
some
senseless
river
running
and
*NL*
running
because
it
did
not
know
enough
to
stop
.
He
saw
,
on
the
faces
*NL*
about
him
,
expressions
of
interest
,
amusement
and
even
mirth
.
He
*NL*
listened
to
the
younger
men
's
laughter
,
and
to
the
praise
of
the
Archer
*NL*
Madeira
,
which
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
and
Mr.
Merry
were
thoughtfully
*NL*
celebrating
.
Through
it
all
he
was
dimly
aware
of
a
general
attitude
*NL*
of
friendliness
toward
himself
,
as
if
the
guard
of
the
prisoner
he
felt
*NL*
himself
to
be
were
trying
to
soften
his
captivity
;
and
the
perception
*NL*
increased
his
passionate
determination
to
be
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
,
where
they
presently
joined
the
ladies
,
he
met
*NL*
May
's
triumphant
eyes
,
and
read
in
them
the
conviction
that
everything
*NL*
had
``
gone
off
''
beautifully
.
She
rose
from
Madame
Olenska
's
side
,
and
*NL*
immediately
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
beckoned
the
latter
to
a
seat
on
the
*NL*
gilt
sofa
where
she
throned
.
Mrs.
Selfridge
Merry
bore
across
the
room
*NL*
to
join
them
,
and
it
became
clear
to
Archer
that
here
also
a
conspiracy
*NL*
of
rehabilitation
and
obliteration
was
going
on
.
The
silent
*NL*
organisation
which
held
his
little
world
together
was
determined
to
put
*NL*
itself
on
record
as
never
for
a
moment
having
questioned
the
propriety
*NL*
of
Madame
Olenska
's
conduct
,
or
the
completeness
of
Archer
's
domestic
*NL*
felicity
.
All
these
amiable
and
inexorable
persons
were
resolutely
*NL*
engaged
in
pretending
to
each
other
that
they
had
never
heard
of
,
*NL*
suspected
,
or
even
conceived
possible
,
the
least
hint
to
the
contrary
;
*NL*
and
from
this
tissue
of
elaborate
mutual
dissimulation
Archer
once
more
*NL*
disengaged
the
fact
that
New
York
believed
him
to
be
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
lover
.
He
caught
the
glitter
of
victory
in
his
wife
's
eyes
,
and
for
*NL*
the
first
time
understood
that
she
shared
the
belief
.
The
discovery
*NL*
roused
a
laughter
of
inner
devils
that
reverberated
through
all
his
*NL*
efforts
to
discuss
the
Martha
Washington
ball
with
Mrs.
Reggie
Chivers
*NL*
and
little
Mrs.
Newland
;
and
so
the
evening
swept
on
,
running
and
*NL*
running
like
a
senseless
river
that
did
not
know
how
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
saw
that
Madame
Olenska
had
risen
and
was
saying
good-bye
.
*NL*
He
understood
that
in
a
moment
she
would
be
gone
,
and
tried
to
remember
*NL*
what
he
had
said
to
her
at
dinner
;
but
he
could
not
recall
a
single
*NL*
word
they
had
exchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
May
,
the
rest
of
the
company
making
a
circle
about
her
*NL*
as
she
advanced
.
The
two
young
women
clasped
hands
;
then
May
bent
*NL*
forward
and
kissed
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
our
hostess
is
much
the
handsomer
of
the
two
,
''
Archer
heard
*NL*
Reggie
Chivers
say
in
an
undertone
to
young
Mrs.
Newland
;
and
he
*NL*
remembered
Beaufort
's
coarse
sneer
at
May
's
ineffectual
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
he
was
in
the
hall
,
putting
Madame
Olenska
's
cloak
about
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
all
his
confusion
of
mind
he
had
held
fast
to
the
resolve
to
*NL*
say
nothing
that
might
startle
or
disturb
her
.
Convinced
that
no
power
*NL*
could
now
turn
him
from
his
purpose
he
had
found
strength
to
let
events
*NL*
shape
themselves
as
they
would
.
But
as
he
followed
Madame
Olenska
into
*NL*
the
hall
he
thought
with
a
sudden
hunger
of
being
for
a
moment
alone
*NL*
with
her
at
the
door
of
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
carriage
here
?
''
he
asked
;
and
at
that
moment
Mrs.
van
der
*NL*
Luyden
,
who
was
being
majestically
inserted
into
her
sables
,
said
*NL*
gently
:
``
We
are
driving
dear
Ellen
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
's
heart
gave
a
jerk
,
and
Madame
Olenska
,
clasping
her
cloak
and
*NL*
fan
with
one
hand
,
held
out
the
other
to
him
.
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
--
but
I
shall
see
you
soon
in
Paris
,
''
he
answered
aloud
--
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
shouted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
murmured
,
``
if
you
and
May
could
come
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
van
der
Luyden
advanced
to
give
her
his
arm
,
and
Archer
turned
to
*NL*
Mrs.
van
der
Luyden
.
For
a
moment
,
in
the
billowy
darkness
inside
the
*NL*
big
landau
,
he
caught
the
dim
oval
of
a
face
,
eyes
shining
*NL*
steadily
--
and
she
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
up
the
steps
he
crossed
Lawrence
Lefferts
coming
down
with
*NL*
his
wife
.
Lefferts
caught
his
host
by
the
sleeve
,
drawing
back
to
let
*NL*
Gertrude
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
old
chap
:
do
you
mind
just
letting
it
be
understood
that
I
'm
*NL*
dining
with
you
at
the
club
tomorrow
night
?
Thanks
so
much
,
you
old
*NL*
brick
!
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
DID
go
off
beautifully
,
did
n't
it
?
''
May
questioned
from
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
roused
himself
with
a
start
.
As
soon
as
the
last
carriage
had
*NL*
driven
away
,
he
had
come
up
to
the
library
and
shut
himself
in
,
with
*NL*
the
hope
that
his
wife
,
who
still
lingered
below
,
would
go
straight
to
*NL*
her
room
.
But
there
she
stood
,
pale
and
drawn
,
yet
radiating
the
*NL*
factitious
energy
of
one
who
has
passed
beyond
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
come
and
talk
it
over
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
if
you
like
.
But
you
must
be
awfully
sleepy
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
sleepy
.
I
should
like
to
sit
with
you
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
,
pushing
her
chair
near
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
and
he
resumed
his
seat
;
but
neither
spoke
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
At
length
Archer
began
abruptly
:
``
Since
you
're
not
tired
,
and
*NL*
want
to
talk
,
there
's
something
I
must
tell
you
.
I
tried
to
the
other
*NL*
night
--
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
quickly
.
``
Yes
,
dear
.
Something
about
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
myself
.
You
say
you
're
not
tired
:
well
,
I
am
.
Horribly
tired
*NL*
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
she
was
all
tender
anxiety
.
``
Oh
,
I
've
seen
it
coming
on
,
*NL*
Newland
!
You
've
been
so
wickedly
overworked
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
that
.
Anyhow
,
I
want
to
make
a
break
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
break
?
To
give
up
the
law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
go
away
,
at
any
rate
--
at
once
.
On
a
long
trip
,
ever
so
far
*NL*
off
--
away
from
everything
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
conscious
that
he
had
failed
in
his
attempt
to
speak
with
*NL*
the
indifference
of
a
man
who
longs
for
a
change
,
and
is
yet
too
weary
*NL*
to
welcome
it
.
Do
what
he
would
,
the
chord
of
eagerness
vibrated
.
*NL*
``
Away
from
everything
--
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
so
far
?
Where
,
for
instance
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
India
--
or
Japan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
,
and
as
he
sat
with
bent
head
,
his
chin
propped
on
his
*NL*
hands
,
he
felt
her
warmly
and
fragrantly
hovering
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
far
as
that
?
But
I
'm
afraid
you
ca
n't
,
dear
...
''
she
said
in
an
*NL*
unsteady
voice
.
``
Not
unless
you
'll
take
me
with
you
.
''
And
then
,
as
he
*NL*
was
silent
,
she
went
on
,
in
tones
so
clear
and
evenly-pitched
that
each
*NL*
separate
syllable
tapped
like
a
little
hammer
on
his
brain
:
``
That
is
,
*NL*
if
the
doctors
will
let
me
go
...
but
I
'm
afraid
they
wo
n't
.
For
you
*NL*
see
,
Newland
,
I
've
been
sure
since
this
morning
of
something
I
've
been
*NL*
so
longing
and
hoping
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
her
with
a
sick
stare
,
and
she
sank
down
,
all
dew
and
*NL*
roses
,
and
hid
her
face
against
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
,
holding
her
to
him
while
his
cold
hand
stroked
*NL*
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
,
which
the
inner
devils
filled
with
strident
*NL*
laughter
;
then
May
freed
herself
from
his
arms
and
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
guess
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
;
no
.
That
is
,
of
course
I
hoped
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
for
an
instant
and
again
fell
silent
;
then
,
*NL*
turning
his
eyes
from
hers
,
he
asked
abruptly
:
``
Have
you
told
any
one
*NL*
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Mamma
and
your
mother
.
''
She
paused
,
and
then
added
hurriedly
,
*NL*
the
blood
flushing
up
to
her
forehead
:
``
That
is
--
and
Ellen
.
You
know
*NL*
I
told
you
we
'd
had
a
long
talk
one
afternoon
--
and
how
dear
she
was
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
''
said
Archer
,
his
heart
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
his
wife
was
watching
him
intently
.
``
Did
you
MIND
my
*NL*
telling
her
first
,
Newland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
?
Why
should
I
?
''
He
made
a
last
effort
to
collect
himself
.
``
But
*NL*
that
was
a
fortnight
ago
,
was
n't
it
?
I
thought
you
said
you
were
n't
*NL*
sure
till
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
colour
burned
deeper
,
but
she
held
his
gaze
.
``
No
;
I
was
n't
sure
*NL*
then
--
but
I
told
her
I
was
.
And
you
see
I
was
right
!

she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
her
blue
eyes
wet
with
victory
.

*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
sat
at
the
writing-table
in
his
library
in
East
*NL*
Thirty-ninth
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
got
back
from
a
big
official
reception
for
the
inauguration
*NL*
of
the
new
galleries
at
the
Metropolitan
Museum
,
and
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
those
great
spaces
crowded
with
the
spoils
of
the
ages
,
where
the
*NL*
throng
of
fashion
circulated
through
a
series
of
scientifically
*NL*
catalogued
treasures
,
had
suddenly
pressed
on
a
rusted
spring
of
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
used
to
be
one
of
the
old
Cesnola
rooms
,
''
he
heard
some
one
*NL*
say
;
and
instantly
everything
about
him
vanished
,
and
he
was
sitting
*NL*
alone
on
a
hard
leather
divan
against
a
radiator
,
while
a
slight
figure
*NL*
in
a
long
sealskin
cloak
moved
away
down
the
meagrely-fitted
vista
of
*NL*
the
old
Museum
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vision
had
roused
a
host
of
other
associations
,
and
he
sat
looking
*NL*
with
new
eyes
at
the
library
which
,
for
over
thirty
years
,
had
been
the
*NL*
scene
of
his
solitary
musings
and
of
all
the
family
confabulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
room
in
which
most
of
the
real
things
of
his
life
had
*NL*
happened
.
There
his
wife
,
nearly
twenty-six
years
ago
,
had
broken
to
*NL*
him
,
with
a
blushing
circumlocution
that
would
have
caused
the
young
*NL*
women
of
the
new
generation
to
smile
,
the
news
that
she
was
to
have
a
*NL*
child
;
and
there
their
eldest
boy
,
Dallas
,
too
delicate
to
be
taken
to
*NL*
church
in
midwinter
,
had
been
christened
by
their
old
friend
the
Bishop
*NL*
of
New
York
,
the
ample
magnificent
irreplaceable
Bishop
,
so
long
the
*NL*
pride
and
ornament
of
his
diocese
.
There
Dallas
had
first
staggered
*NL*
across
the
floor
shouting
``
Dad
,
''
while
May
and
the
nurse
laughed
behind
*NL*
the
door
;
there
their
second
child
,
Mary
-LRB-
who
was
so
like
her
mother
-RRB-
,
*NL*
had
announced
her
engagement
to
the
dullest
and
most
reliable
of
Reggie
*NL*
Chivers
's
many
sons
;
and
there
Archer
had
kissed
her
through
her
*NL*
wedding
veil
before
they
went
down
to
the
motor
which
was
to
carry
them
*NL*
to
Grace
Church
--
for
in
a
world
where
all
else
had
reeled
on
its
*NL*
foundations
the
``
Grace
Church
wedding
''
remained
an
unchanged
*NL*
institution
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
library
that
he
and
May
had
always
discussed
the
future
*NL*
of
the
children
:
the
studies
of
Dallas
and
his
young
brother
Bill
,
*NL*
Mary
's
incurable
indifference
to
``
accomplishments
,
''
and
passion
for
*NL*
sport
and
philanthropy
,
and
the
vague
leanings
toward
``
art
''
which
had
*NL*
finally
landed
the
restless
and
curious
Dallas
in
the
office
of
a
*NL*
rising
New
York
architect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
nowadays
were
emancipating
themselves
from
the
law
and
*NL*
business
and
taking
up
all
sorts
of
new
things
.
If
they
were
not
*NL*
absorbed
in
state
politics
or
municipal
reform
,
the
chances
were
that
*NL*
they
were
going
in
for
Central
American
archaeology
,
for
architecture
*NL*
or
landscape-engineering
;
taking
a
keen
and
learned
interest
in
the
*NL*
prerevolutionary
buildings
of
their
own
country
,
studying
and
adapting
*NL*
Georgian
types
,
and
protesting
at
the
meaningless
use
of
the
word
*NL*
``
Colonial
.
''
Nobody
nowadays
had
``
Colonial
''
houses
except
the
*NL*
millionaire
grocers
of
the
suburbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
above
all
--
sometimes
Archer
put
it
above
all
--
it
was
in
that
*NL*
library
that
the
Governor
of
New
York
,
coming
down
from
Albany
one
*NL*
evening
to
dine
and
spend
the
night
,
had
turned
to
his
host
,
and
said
,
*NL*
banging
his
clenched
fist
on
the
table
and
gnashing
his
eye-glasses
:
*NL*
``
Hang
the
professional
politician
!
You
're
the
kind
of
man
the
country
*NL*
wants
,
Archer
.
If
the
stable
's
ever
to
be
cleaned
out
,
men
like
you
*NL*
have
got
to
lend
a
hand
in
the
cleaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Men
like
you
--
''
how
Archer
had
glowed
at
the
phrase
!
How
eagerly
he
*NL*
had
risen
up
at
the
call
!
It
was
an
echo
of
Ned
Winsett
's
old
appeal
*NL*
to
roll
his
sleeves
up
and
get
down
into
the
muck
;
but
spoken
by
a
man
*NL*
who
set
the
example
of
the
gesture
,
and
whose
summons
to
follow
him
was
*NL*
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
,
as
he
looked
back
,
was
not
sure
that
men
like
himself
WERE
what
*NL*
his
country
needed
,
at
least
in
the
active
service
to
which
Theodore
*NL*
Roosevelt
had
pointed
;
in
fact
,
there
was
reason
to
think
it
did
not
,
*NL*
for
after
a
year
in
the
State
Assembly
he
had
not
been
re-elected
,
and
*NL*
had
dropped
back
thankfully
into
obscure
if
useful
municipal
work
,
and
*NL*
from
that
again
to
the
writing
of
occasional
articles
in
one
of
the
*NL*
reforming
weeklies
that
were
trying
to
shake
the
country
out
of
its
*NL*
apathy
.
It
was
little
enough
to
look
back
on
;
but
when
he
remembered
*NL*
to
what
the
young
men
of
his
generation
and
his
set
had
looked
*NL*
forward
--
the
narrow
groove
of
money-making
,
sport
and
society
to
which
*NL*
their
vision
had
been
limited
--
even
his
small
contribution
to
the
new
*NL*
state
of
things
seemed
to
count
,
as
each
brick
counts
in
a
well-built
*NL*
wall
.
He
had
done
little
in
public
life
;
he
would
always
be
by
nature
*NL*
a
contemplative
and
a
dilettante
;
but
he
had
had
high
things
to
*NL*
contemplate
,
great
things
to
delight
in
;
and
one
great
man
's
friendship
*NL*
to
be
his
strength
and
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
,
in
short
,
what
people
were
beginning
to
call
``
a
good
*NL*
citizen
.
''
In
New
York
,
for
many
years
past
,
every
new
movement
,
*NL*
philanthropic
,
municipal
or
artistic
,
had
taken
account
of
his
opinion
*NL*
and
wanted
his
name
.
People
said
:
``
Ask
Archer
''
when
there
was
a
*NL*
question
of
starting
the
first
school
for
crippled
children
,
*NL*
reorganising
the
Museum
of
Art
,
founding
the
Grolier
Club
,
inaugurating
*NL*
the
new
Library
,
or
getting
up
a
new
society
of
chamber
music
.
His
*NL*
days
were
full
,
and
they
were
filled
decently
.
He
supposed
it
was
all
*NL*
a
man
ought
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
he
knew
he
had
missed
:
the
flower
of
life
.
But
he
thought
of
*NL*
it
now
as
a
thing
so
unattainable
and
improbable
that
to
have
repined
*NL*
would
have
been
like
despairing
because
one
had
not
drawn
the
first
*NL*
prize
in
a
lottery
.
There
were
a
hundred
million
tickets
in
HIS
*NL*
lottery
,
and
there
was
only
one
prize
;
the
chances
had
been
too
*NL*
decidedly
against
him
.
When
he
thought
of
Ellen
Olenska
it
was
*NL*
abstractly
,
serenely
,
as
one
might
think
of
some
imaginary
beloved
in
a
*NL*
book
or
a
picture
:
she
had
become
the
composite
vision
of
all
that
he
*NL*
had
missed
.
That
vision
,
faint
and
tenuous
as
it
was
,
had
kept
him
*NL*
from
thinking
of
other
women
.
He
had
been
what
was
called
a
faithful
*NL*
husband
;
and
when
May
had
suddenly
died
--
carried
off
by
the
infectious
*NL*
pneumonia
through
which
she
had
nursed
their
youngest
child
--
he
had
*NL*
honestly
mourned
her
.
Their
long
years
together
had
shown
him
that
it
*NL*
did
not
so
much
matter
if
marriage
was
a
dull
duty
,
as
long
as
it
kept
*NL*
the
dignity
of
a
duty
:
lapsing
from
that
,
it
became
a
mere
battle
of
*NL*
ugly
appetites
.
Looking
about
him
,
he
honoured
his
own
past
,
and
*NL*
mourned
for
it
.
After
all
,
there
was
good
in
the
old
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
,
making
the
round
of
the
room
--
done
over
by
Dallas
with
*NL*
English
mezzotints
,
Chippendale
cabinets
,
bits
of
chosen
blue-and-white
*NL*
and
pleasantly
shaded
electric
lamps
--
came
back
to
the
old
Eastlake
*NL*
writing-table
that
he
had
never
been
willing
to
banish
,
and
to
his
*NL*
first
photograph
of
May
,
which
still
kept
its
place
beside
his
inkstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
she
was
,
tall
,
round-bosomed
and
willowy
,
in
her
starched
muslin
*NL*
and
flapping
Leghorn
,
as
he
had
seen
her
under
the
orange-trees
in
the
*NL*
Mission
garden
.
And
as
he
had
seen
her
that
day
,
so
she
had
remained
;
*NL*
never
quite
at
the
same
height
,
yet
never
far
below
it
:
generous
,
*NL*
faithful
,
unwearied
;
but
so
lacking
in
imagination
,
so
incapable
of
*NL*
growth
,
that
the
world
of
her
youth
had
fallen
into
pieces
and
rebuilt
*NL*
itself
without
her
ever
being
conscious
of
the
change
.
This
hard
*NL*
bright
blindness
had
kept
her
immediate
horizon
apparently
unaltered
.
*NL*
Her
incapacity
to
recognise
change
made
her
children
conceal
their
*NL*
views
from
her
as
Archer
concealed
his
;
there
had
been
,
from
the
first
,
*NL*
a
joint
pretence
of
sameness
,
a
kind
of
innocent
family
hypocrisy
,
in
*NL*
which
father
and
children
had
unconsciously
collaborated
.
And
she
had
*NL*
died
thinking
the
world
a
good
place
,
full
of
loving
and
harmonious
*NL*
households
like
her
own
,
and
resigned
to
leave
it
because
she
was
*NL*
convinced
that
,
whatever
happened
,
Newland
would
continue
to
inculcate
*NL*
in
Dallas
the
same
principles
and
prejudices
which
had
shaped
his
*NL*
parents
'
lives
,
and
that
Dallas
in
turn
-LRB-
when
Newland
followed
her
-RRB-
*NL*
would
transmit
the
sacred
trust
to
little
Bill
.
And
of
Mary
she
was
*NL*
sure
as
of
her
own
self
.
So
,
having
snatched
little
Bill
from
the
*NL*
grave
,
and
given
her
life
in
the
effort
,
she
went
contentedly
to
her
*NL*
place
in
the
Archer
vault
in
St.
Mark
's
,
where
Mrs.
Archer
already
lay
*NL*
safe
from
the
terrifying
``
trend
''
which
her
daughter-in-law
had
never
*NL*
even
become
aware
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
May
's
portrait
stood
one
of
her
daughter
.
Mary
Chivers
was
as
*NL*
tall
and
fair
as
her
mother
,
but
large-waisted
,
flat-chested
and
*NL*
slightly
slouching
,
as
the
altered
fashion
required
.
Mary
Chivers
's
*NL*
mighty
feats
of
athleticism
could
not
have
been
performed
with
the
*NL*
twenty-inch
waist
that
May
Archer
's
azure
sash
so
easily
spanned
.
And
*NL*
the
difference
seemed
symbolic
;
the
mother
's
life
had
been
as
closely
*NL*
girt
as
her
figure
.
Mary
,
who
was
no
less
conventional
,
and
no
more
*NL*
intelligent
,
yet
led
a
larger
life
and
held
more
tolerant
views
.
There
*NL*
was
good
in
the
new
order
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
telephone
clicked
,
and
Archer
,
turning
from
the
photographs
,
*NL*
unhooked
the
transmitter
at
his
elbow
.
How
far
they
were
from
the
days
*NL*
when
the
legs
of
the
brass-buttoned
messenger
boy
had
been
New
York
's
*NL*
only
means
of
quick
communication

*NL*
``
Chicago

*NL*
*NL*
Ah
--
it
must
be
a
long-distance
from
Dallas
,
who
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
Chicago
by
his
firm
to
talk
over
the
plan
of
the
Lakeside
palace
they
*NL*
were
to
build
for
a
young
millionaire
with
ideas
.
The

always
sent
*NL*
Dallas
on
such
errands
.

*NL*
``

broke
into
a
joyful
conscious
laugh
--
``
so
we
*NL*
must
look
alive
.
I
say
,
Dad
,
I
want
your
help
:
do
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
seemed
to
be
speaking
in
the
room
:
the
voice
was
as
near
by
and
*NL*
natural
as
if
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
favourite
arm-chair
by
the
*NL*
fire
.
The
fact
would
not
ordinarily
have
surprised
Archer
,
for
*NL*
long-distance
telephoning
had
become
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
*NL*
electric
lighting
and
five-day
Atlantic
voyages
.
But
the
laugh
did
*NL*
startle
him
;
it
still
seemed
wonderful
that
across
all
those
miles
and
*NL*
miles
of
country
--
forest
,
river
,
mountain
,
prairie
,
roaring
cities
and
*NL*
busy
indifferent
millions
--
Dallas
's
laugh
should
be
able
to
say
:
``
Of
*NL*
course
,
whatever
happens
,
I
must
get
back
on
the
first
,
because
Fanny
*NL*
Beaufort
and
I
are
to
be
married
on
the
fifth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
began
again
:
``
Think
it
over
?
No
,
sir
:
not
a
minute
.
You
've
*NL*
got
to
say
yes
now
.
Why
not
,
I
'd
like
to
know
?
If
you
can
allege
a
*NL*
single
reason
--
No
;
I
knew
it
.
Then
it
's
a
go
,
eh
?
Because
I
count
on
*NL*
you
to
ring
up
the
Cunard
office
first
thing
tomorrow
;
and
you
'd
better
*NL*
book
a
return
on
a
boat
from
Marseilles
.
I
say
,
Dad
;
it
'll
be
our
last
*NL*
time
together
,
in
this
kind
of
way
--
.
Oh
,
good
!
I
knew
you
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chicago
rang
off
,
and
Archer
rose
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
their
last
time
together
in
this
kind
of
way
:
the
boy
was
*NL*
right
.
They
would
have
lots
of
other
``
times
''
after
Dallas
's
marriage
,
*NL*
his
father
was
sure
;
for
the
two
were
born
comrades
,
and
Fanny
*NL*
Beaufort
,
whatever
one
might
think
of
her
,
did
not
seem
likely
to
*NL*
interfere
with
their
intimacy
.
On
the
contrary
,
from
what
he
had
seen
*NL*
of
her
,
he
thought
she
would
be
naturally
included
in
it
.
Still
,
*NL*
change
was
change
,
and
differences
were
differences
,
and
much
as
he
*NL*
felt
himself
drawn
toward
his
future
daughter-in-law
,
it
was
tempting
*NL*
to
seize
this
last
chance
of
being
alone
with
his
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reason
why
he
should
not
seize
it
,
except
the
profound
one
*NL*
that
he
had
lost
the
habit
of
travel
.
May
had
disliked
to
move
except
*NL*
for
valid
reasons
,
such
as
taking
the
children
to
the
sea
or
in
the
*NL*
mountains
:
she
could
imagine
no
other
motive
for
leaving
the
house
in
*NL*
Thirty-ninth
Street
or
their
comfortable
quarters
at
the
Wellands
'
in
*NL*
Newport
.
After
Dallas
had
taken
his
degree
she
had
thought
it
her
duty
*NL*
to
travel
for
six
months
;
and
the
whole
family
had
made
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
tour
through
England
,
Switzerland
and
Italy
.
Their
time
*NL*
being
limited
-LRB-
no
one
knew
why
-RRB-
they
had
omitted
France
.
Archer
*NL*
remembered
Dallas
's
wrath
at
being
asked
to
contemplate
Mont
Blanc
*NL*
instead
of
Rheims
and
Chartres
.
But
Mary
and
Bill
wanted
*NL*
mountain-climbing
,
and
had
already
yawned
their
way
in
Dallas
's
wake
*NL*
through
the
English
cathedrals
;
and
May
,
always
fair
to
her
children
,
*NL*
had
insisted
on
holding
the
balance
evenly
between
their
athletic
and
*NL*
artistic
proclivities
.
She
had
indeed
proposed
that
her
husband
should
*NL*
go
to
Paris
for
a
fortnight
,
and
join
them
on
the
Italian
lakes
after
*NL*
they
had
``
done
''
Switzerland
;
but
Archer
had
declined
.
``
We
'll
stick
*NL*
together
,
''
he
said
;
and
May
's
face
had
brightened
at
his
setting
such
a
*NL*
good
example
to
Dallas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
her
death
,
nearly
two
years
before
,
there
had
been
no
reason
for
*NL*
his
continuing
in
the
same
routine
.
His
children
had
urged
him
to
*NL*
travel
:
Mary
Chivers
had
felt
sure
it
would
do
him
good
to
go
abroad
*NL*
and
``
see
the
galleries
.
''
The
very
mysteriousness
of
such
a
cure
made
*NL*
her
the
more
confident
of
its
efficacy
.
But
Archer
had
found
himself
*NL*
held
fast
by
habit
,
by
memories
,
by
a
sudden
startled
shrinking
from
*NL*
new
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
he
reviewed
his
past
,
he
saw
into
what
a
deep
rut
he
had
sunk
.
*NL*
The
worst
of
doing
one
's
duty
was
that
it
apparently
unfitted
one
for
*NL*
doing
anything
else
.
At
least
that
was
the
view
that
the
men
of
his
*NL*
generation
had
taken
.
The
trenchant
divisions
between
right
and
wrong
,
*NL*
honest
and
dishonest
,
respectable
and
the
reverse
,
had
left
so
little
*NL*
scope
for
the
unforeseen
.
There
are
moments
when
a
man
's
imagination
,
*NL*
so
easily
subdued
to
what
it
lives
in
,
suddenly
rises
above
its
daily
*NL*
level
,
and
surveys
the
long
windings
of
destiny
.
Archer
hung
there
and
*NL*
wondered
...
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
left
of
the
little
world
he
had
grown
up
in
,
and
whose
*NL*
standards
had
bent
and
bound
him
?
He
remembered
a
sneering
prophecy
of
*NL*
poor
Lawrence
Lefferts
's
,
uttered
years
ago
in
that
very
room
:
``
If
*NL*
things
go
on
at
this
rate
,
our
children
will
be
marrying
Beaufort
's
*NL*
bastards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
what
Archer
's
eldest
son
,
the
pride
of
his
life
,
was
doing
;
*NL*
and
nobody
wondered
or
reproved
.
Even
the
boy
's
Aunt
Janey
,
who
still
*NL*
looked
so
exactly
as
she
used
to
in
her
elderly
youth
,
had
taken
her
*NL*
mother
's
emeralds
and
seed-pearls
out
of
their
pink
cotton-wool
,
and
*NL*
carried
them
with
her
own
twitching
hands
to
the
future
bride
;
and
*NL*
Fanny
Beaufort
,
instead
of
looking
disappointed
at
not
receiving
a
*NL*
``
set
''
from
a
Paris
jeweller
,
had
exclaimed
at
their
old-fashioned
*NL*
beauty
,
and
declared
that
when
she
wore
them
she
should
feel
like
an
*NL*
Isabey
miniature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
Beaufort
,
who
had
appeared
in
New
York
at
eighteen
,
after
the
*NL*
death
of
her
parents
,
had
won
its
heart
much
as
Madame
Olenska
had
won
*NL*
it
thirty
years
earlier
;
only
instead
of
being
distrustful
and
afraid
*NL*
of
her
,
society
took
her
joyfully
for
granted
.
She
was
pretty
,
amusing
*NL*
and
accomplished
:
what
more
did
any
one
want
?
Nobody
was
narrow-minded
*NL*
enough
to
rake
up
against
her
the
half-forgotten
facts
of
her
father
's
*NL*
past
and
her
own
origin
.
Only
the
older
people
remembered
so
obscure
*NL*
an
incident
in
the
business
life
of
New
York
as
Beaufort
's
failure
,
or
*NL*
the
fact
that
after
his
wife
's
death
he
had
been
quietly
married
to
the
*NL*
notorious
Fanny
Ring
,
and
had
left
the
country
with
his
new
wife
,
and
a
*NL*
little
girl
who
inherited
her
beauty
.
He
was
subsequently
heard
of
in
*NL*
Constantinople
,
then
in
Russia
;
and
a
dozen
years
later
American
*NL*
travellers
were
handsomely
entertained
by
him
in
Buenos
Ayres
,
where
he
*NL*
represented
a
large
insurance
agency
.
He
and
his
wife
died
there
in
*NL*
the
odour
of
prosperity
;
and
one
day
their
orphaned
daughter
had
*NL*
appeared
in
New
York
in
charge
of
May
Archer
's
sister-in-law
,
Mrs.
Jack
*NL*
Welland
,
whose
husband
had
been
appointed
the
girl
's
guardian
.
The
*NL*
fact
threw
her
into
almost
cousinly
relationship
with
Newland
Archer
's
*NL*
children
,
and
nobody
was
surprised
when
Dallas
's
engagement
was
*NL*
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
more
dearly
give
the
measure
of
the
distance
that
the
*NL*
world
had
travelled
.
People
nowadays
were
too
busy
--
busy
with
reforms
*NL*
and
``
movements
,
''
with
fads
and
fetishes
and
frivolities
--
to
bother
much
*NL*
about
their
neighbours
.
And
of
what
account
was
anybody
's
past
,
in
the
*NL*
huge
kaleidoscope
where
all
the
social
atoms
spun
around
on
the
same
*NL*
plane
?
*NL*
*NL*
Newland
Archer
,
looking
out
of
his
hotel
window
at
the
stately
gaiety
*NL*
of
the
Paris
streets
,
felt
his
heart
beating
with
the
confusion
and
*NL*
eagerness
of
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
since
it
had
thus
plunged
and
reared
under
his
widening
*NL*
waistcoat
,
leaving
him
,
the
next
minute
,
with
an
empty
breast
and
hot
*NL*
temples
.
He
wondered
if
it
was
thus
that
his
son
's
conducted
itself
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
Miss
Fanny
Beaufort
--
and
decided
that
it
was
not
.
``
It
*NL*
functions
as
actively
,
no
doubt
,
but
the
rhythm
is
different
,
''
he
*NL*
reflected
,
recalling
the
cool
composure
with
which
the
young
man
had
*NL*
announced
his
engagement
,
and
taken
for
granted
that
his
family
would
*NL*
approve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
difference
is
that
these
young
people
take
it
for
granted
that
*NL*
they
're
going
to
get
whatever
they
want
,
and
that
we
almost
always
took
*NL*
it
for
granted
that
we
should
n't
.
Only
,
I
wonder
--
the
thing
one
's
so
*NL*
certain
of
in
advance
:
can
it
ever
make
one
's
heart
beat
as
wildly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
day
after
their
arrival
in
Paris
,
and
the
spring
sunshine
*NL*
held
Archer
in
his
open
window
,
above
the
wide
silvery
prospect
of
the
*NL*
Place
Vendome
.
One
of
the
things
he
had
stipulated
--
almost
the
only
*NL*
one
--
when
he
had
agreed
to
come
abroad
with
Dallas
,
was
that
,
in
Paris
,
*NL*
he
should
n't
be
made
to
go
to
one
of
the
newfangled
``
palaces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
--
of
course
,
''
Dallas
good-naturedly
agreed
.
``
I
'll
take
*NL*
you
to
some
jolly
old-fashioned
place
--
the
Bristol
say
--
''
leaving
his
*NL*
father
speechless
at
hearing
that
the
century-long
home
of
kings
and
*NL*
emperors
was
now
spoken
of
as
an
old-fashioned
inn
,
where
one
went
for
*NL*
its
quaint
inconveniences
and
lingering
local
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
pictured
often
enough
,
in
the
first
impatient
years
,
the
*NL*
scene
of
his
return
to
Paris
;
then
the
personal
vision
had
faded
,
and
*NL*
he
had
simply
tried
to
see
the
city
as
the
setting
of
Madame
Olenska
's
*NL*
life
.
Sitting
alone
at
night
in
his
library
,
after
the
household
had
*NL*
gone
to
bed
,
he
had
evoked
the
radiant
outbreak
of
spring
down
the
*NL*
avenues
of
horse-chestnuts
,
the
flowers
and
statues
in
the
public
*NL*
gardens
,
the
whiff
of
lilacs
from
the
flower-carts
,
the
majestic
roll
*NL*
of
the
river
under
the
great
bridges
,
and
the
life
of
art
and
study
and
*NL*
pleasure
that
filled
each
mighty
artery
to
bursting
.
Now
the
spectacle
*NL*
was
before
him
in
its
glory
,
and
as
he
looked
out
on
it
he
felt
shy
,
*NL*
old-fashioned
,
inadequate
:
a
mere
grey
speck
of
a
man
compared
with
the
*NL*
ruthless
magnificent
fellow
he
had
dreamed
of
being
...
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
's
hand
came
down
cheerily
on
his
shoulder
.
``
Hullo
,
father
:
this
*NL*
is
something
like
,
is
n't
it
?
''
They
stood
for
a
while
looking
out
in
*NL*
silence
,
and
then
the
young
man
continued
:
``
By
the
way
,
I
've
got
a
*NL*
message
for
you
:
the
Countess
Olenska
expects
us
both
at
half-past
*NL*
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
it
lightly
,
carelessly
,
as
he
might
have
imparted
any
casual
*NL*
item
of
information
,
such
as
the
hour
at
which
their
train
was
to
leave
*NL*
for
Florence
the
next
evening
.
Archer
looked
at
him
,
and
thought
he
*NL*
saw
in
his
gay
young
eyes
a
gleam
of
his
great-grandmother
Mingott
's
*NL*
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
n't
I
tell
you
?
''
Dallas
pursued
.
``
Fanny
made
me
swear
to
do
*NL*
three
things
while
I
was
in
Paris
:
get
her
the
score
of
the
last
*NL*
Debussy
songs
,
go
to
the
Grand-Guignol
and
see
Madame
Olenska
.
You
*NL*
know
she
was
awfully
good
to
Fanny
when
Mr.
Beaufort
sent
her
over
from
*NL*
Buenos
Ayres
to
the
Assomption
.
Fanny
had
n't
any
friends
in
Paris
,
and
*NL*
Madame
Olenska
used
to
be
kind
to
her
and
trot
her
about
on
holidays
.
*NL*
I
believe
she
was
a
great
friend
of
the
first
Mrs.
Beaufort
's
.
And
*NL*
she
's
our
cousin
,
of
course
.
So
I
rang
her
up
this
morning
,
before
I
*NL*
went
out
,
and
told
her
you
and
I
were
here
for
two
days
and
wanted
to
*NL*
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
continued
to
stare
at
him
.
``
You
told
her
I
was
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
--
why
not
?
''
Dallas
's
eye
brows
went
up
whimsically
.
Then
,
*NL*
getting
no
answer
,
he
slipped
his
arm
through
his
father
's
with
a
*NL*
confidential
pressure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
father
:
what
was
she
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
felt
his
colour
rise
under
his
son
's
unabashed
gaze
.
``
Come
,
own
*NL*
up
:
you
and
she
were
great
pals
,
were
n't
you
?
Was
n't
she
most
awfully
*NL*
lovely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
?
I
do
n't
know
.
She
was
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
there
you
have
it
!
That
's
what
it
always
comes
to
,
does
n't
it
?
*NL*
When
she
comes
,
SHE
'S
DIFFERENT
--
and
one
does
n't
know
why
.
It
's
*NL*
exactly
what
I
feel
about
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
drew
back
a
step
,
releasing
his
arm
.
``
About
Fanny
?
But
,
my
*NL*
dear
fellow

I
should
hope
so
!

,
do
n't
be
prehistoric
!
Was
n't
she
--
once
--
your
Fanny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
belonged
body
and
soul
to
the
new
generation
.
He
was
the
*NL*
first-born
of
Newland
and
May
Archer
,
yet
it
had
never
been
possible
to
*NL*
inculcate
in
him
even
the
rudiments
of
reserve
.
``
What
's
the
use
of
*NL*
making
mysteries
?
It
only
makes
people
want
to
nose
'em
out
,
''
he
*NL*
always
objected
when
enjoined
to
discretion
.
But
Archer
,
meeting
his
*NL*
eyes
,
saw
the
filial
light
under
their
banter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Fanny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
woman
you
'd
have
chucked
everything
for
:
only
you
did
n't
,
''
*NL*
continued
his
surprising
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
,
''
echoed
Archer
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
:
you
date
,
you
see
,
dear
old
boy
.
But
mother
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
the
day
before
she
died
.
It
was
when
she
sent
for
me
alone
--
you
*NL*
remember
?
She
said
she
knew
we
were
safe
with
you
,
and
always
would
*NL*
be
,
because
once
,
when
she
asked
you
to
,
you
'd
given
up
the
thing
you
*NL*
most
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
received
this
strange
communication
in
silence
.
His
eyes
*NL*
remained
unseeingly
fixed
on
the
thronged
sunlit
square
below
the
*NL*
window
.
At
length
he
said
in
a
low
voice
:
``
She
never
asked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
forgot
.
You
never
did
ask
each
other
anything
,
did
you
?
And
*NL*
you
never
told
each
other
anything
.
You
just
sat
and
watched
each
*NL*
other
,
and
guessed
at
what
was
going
on
underneath
.
A
deaf-and-dumb
*NL*
asylum
,
in
fact
!
Well
,
I
back
your
generation
for
knowing
more
about
*NL*
each
other
's
private
thoughts
than
we
ever
have
time
to
find
out
about
*NL*
our
own
.
--
I
say
,
Dad
,
''
Dallas
broke
off
,
``
you
're
not
angry
with
me
?
If
*NL*
you
are
,
let
's
make
it
up
and
go
and
lunch
at
Henri
's
.
I
've
got
to
*NL*
rush
out
to
Versailles
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
did
not
accompany
his
son
to
Versailles
.
He
preferred
to
spend
*NL*
the
afternoon
in
solitary
roamings
through
Paris
.
He
had
to
deal
all
*NL*
at
once
with
the
packed
regrets
and
stifled
memories
of
an
inarticulate
*NL*
lifetime
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
he
did
not
regret
Dallas
's
indiscretion
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
take
an
iron
band
from
his
heart
to
know
that
,
after
all
,
*NL*
some
one
had
guessed
and
pitied
...
And
that
it
should
have
been
his
*NL*
wife
moved
him
indescribably
.
Dallas
,
for
all
his
affectionate
*NL*
insight
,
would
not
have
understood
that
.
To
the
boy
,
no
doubt
,
the
*NL*
episode
was
only
a
pathetic
instance
of
vain
frustration
,
of
wasted
*NL*
forces
.
But
was
it
really
no
more
?
For
a
long
time
Archer
sat
on
a
*NL*
bench
in
the
Champs
Elysees
and
wondered
,
while
the
stream
of
life
*NL*
rolled
by
...
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
streets
away
,
a
few
hours
away
,
Ellen
Olenska
waited
.
She
had
*NL*
never
gone
back
to
her
husband
,
and
when
he
had
died
,
some
years
*NL*
before
,
she
had
made
no
change
in
her
way
of
living
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
now
to
keep
her
and
Archer
apart
--
and
that
afternoon
he
was
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
walked
across
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
and
the
Tuileries
*NL*
gardens
to
the
Louvre
.
She
had
once
told
him
that
she
often
went
*NL*
there
,
and
he
had
a
fancy
to
spend
the
intervening
time
in
a
place
*NL*
where
he
could
think
of
her
as
perhaps
having
lately
been
.
For
an
hour
*NL*
or
more
he
wandered
from
gallery
to
gallery
through
the
dazzle
of
*NL*
afternoon
light
,
and
one
by
one
the
pictures
burst
on
him
in
their
*NL*
half-forgotten
splendour
,
filling
his
soul
with
the
long
echoes
of
*NL*
beauty
.
After
all
,
his
life
had
been
too
starved
...
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
before
an
effulgent
Titian
,
he
found
himself
saying
:
``
But
*NL*
I
'm
only
fifty-seven
--
''
and
then
he
turned
away
.
For
such
summer
*NL*
dreams
it
was
too
late
;
but
surely
not
for
a
quiet
harvest
of
*NL*
friendship
,
of
comradeship
,
in
the
blessed
hush
of
her
nearness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
hotel
,
where
he
and
Dallas
were
to
meet
;
and
*NL*
together
they
walked
again
across
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
and
over
the
*NL*
bridge
that
leads
to
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
,
unconscious
of
what
was
going
on
in
his
father
's
mind
,
was
*NL*
talking
excitedly
and
abundantly
of
Versailles
.
He
had
had
but
one
*NL*
previous
glimpse
of
it
,
during
a
holiday
trip
in
which
he
had
tried
to
*NL*
pack
all
the
sights
he
had
been
deprived
of
when
he
had
had
to
go
with
*NL*
the
family
to
Switzerland
;
and
tumultuous
enthusiasm
and
cock-sure
*NL*
criticism
tripped
each
other
up
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Archer
listened
,
his
sense
of
inadequacy
and
inexpressiveness
*NL*
increased
.
The
boy
was
not
insensitive
,
he
knew
;
but
he
had
the
*NL*
facility
and
self-confidence
that
came
of
looking
at
fate
not
as
a
*NL*
master
but
as
an
equal
.
``
That
's
it
:
they
feel
equal
to
things
--
they
*NL*
know
their
way
about
,
''
he
mused
,
thinking
of
his
son
as
the
spokesman
*NL*
of
the
new
generation
which
had
swept
away
all
the
old
landmarks
,
and
*NL*
with
them
the
sign-posts
and
the
danger-signal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Dallas
stopped
short
,
grasping
his
father
's
arm
.
``
Oh
,
by
*NL*
Jove
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
come
out
into
the
great
tree-planted
space
before
the
*NL*
Invalides
.
The
dome
of
Mansart
floated
ethereally
above
the
budding
*NL*
trees
and
the
long
grey
front
of
the
building
:
drawing
up
into
itself
*NL*
all
the
rays
of
afternoon
light
,
it
hung
there
like
the
visible
symbol
*NL*
of
the
race
's
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
knew
that
Madame
Olenska
lived
in
a
square
near
one
of
the
*NL*
avenues
radiating
from
the
Invalides
;
and
he
had
pictured
the
quarter
*NL*
as
quiet
and
almost
obscure
,
forgetting
the
central
splendour
that
lit
*NL*
it
up
.
Now
,
by
some
queer
process
of
association
,
that
golden
light
*NL*
became
for
him
the
pervading
illumination
in
which
she
lived
.
For
*NL*
nearly
thirty
years
,
her
life
--
of
which
he
knew
so
strangely
*NL*
little
--
had
been
spent
in
this
rich
atmosphere
that
he
already
felt
to
*NL*
be
too
dense
and
yet
too
stimulating
for
his
lungs
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
theatres
she
must
have
been
to
,
the
pictures
she
must
have
looked
at
,
*NL*
the
sober
and
splendid
old
houses
she
must
have
frequented
,
the
people
*NL*
she
must
have
talked
with
,
the
incessant
stir
of
ideas
,
curiosities
,
*NL*
images
and
associations
thrown
out
by
an
intensely
social
race
in
a
*NL*
setting
of
immemorial
manners
;
and
suddenly
he
remembered
the
young
*NL*
Frenchman
who
had
once
said
to
him
:
``
Ah
,
good
conversation
--
there
is
*NL*
nothing
like
it
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
had
not
seen
M.
Riviere
,
or
heard
of
him
,
for
nearly
thirty
*NL*
years
;
and
that
fact
gave
the
measure
of
his
ignorance
of
Madame
*NL*
Olenska
's
existence
.
More
than
half
a
lifetime
divided
them
,
and
she
*NL*
had
spent
the
long
interval
among
people
he
did
not
know
,
in
a
society
*NL*
he
but
faintly
guessed
at
,
in
conditions
he
would
never
wholly
*NL*
understand
.
During
that
time
he
had
been
living
with
his
youthful
*NL*
memory
of
her
;
but
she
had
doubtless
had
other
and
more
tangible
*NL*
companionship
.
Perhaps
she
too
had
kept
her
memory
of
him
as
something
*NL*
apart
;
but
if
she
had
,
it
must
have
been
like
a
relic
in
a
small
dim
*NL*
chapel
,
where
there
was
not
time
to
pray
every
day
...
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
crossed
the
Place
des
Invalides
,
and
were
walking
down
one
of
*NL*
the
thoroughfares
flanking
the
building
.
It
was
a
quiet
quarter
,
after
*NL*
all
,
in
spite
of
its
splendour
and
its
history
;
and
the
fact
gave
one
*NL*
an
idea
of
the
riches
Paris
had
to
draw
on
,
since
such
scenes
as
this
*NL*
were
left
to
the
few
and
the
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
fading
into
a
soft
sun-shot
haze
,
pricked
here
and
there
by
*NL*
a
yellow
electric
light
,
and
passers
were
rare
in
the
little
square
*NL*
into
which
they
had
turned
.
Dallas
stopped
again
,
and
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
here
,
''
he
said
,
slipping
his
arm
through
his
father
's
with
*NL*
a
movement
from
which
Archer
's
shyness
did
not
shrink
;
and
they
stood
*NL*
together
looking
up
at
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
modern
building
,
without
distinctive
character
,
but
*NL*
many-windowed
,
and
pleasantly
balconied
up
its
wide
cream-coloured
*NL*
front
.
On
one
of
the
upper
balconies
,
which
hung
well
above
the
*NL*
rounded
tops
of
the
horse-chestnuts
in
the
square
,
the
awnings
were
*NL*
still
lowered
,
as
though
the
sun
had
just
left
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
which
floor
--
?
''
Dallas
conjectured
;
and
moving
toward
the
*NL*
porte-cochere
he
put
his
head
into
the
porter
's
lodge
,
and
came
back
to
*NL*
say
:
``
The
fifth
.
It
must
be
the
one
with
the
awnings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
remained
motionless
,
gazing
at
the
upper
windows
as
if
the
end
*NL*
of
their
pilgrimage
had
been
attained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
you
know
,
it
's
nearly
six
,
''
his
son
at
length
reminded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
glanced
away
at
an
empty
bench
under
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
'll
sit
there
a
moment
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
are
n't
you
well
?
''
his
son
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
perfectly
.
But
I
should
like
you
,
please
,
to
go
up
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
paused
before
him
,
visibly
bewildered
.
``
But
,
I
say
,
Dad
:
do
you
*NL*
mean
you
wo
n't
come
up
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Archer
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
she
wo
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
my
boy
;
perhaps
I
shall
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
gave
him
a
long
look
through
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
on
earth
shall
I
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
do
n't
you
always
know
what
to
say
?
''
his
father
*NL*
rejoined
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
I
shall
say
you
're
old-fashioned
,
and
prefer
walking
up
*NL*
the
five
flights
because
you
do
n't
like
lifts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
smiled
again
.
``
Say
I
'm
old-fashioned
:
that
's
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dallas
looked
at
him
again
,
and
then
,
with
an
incredulous
gesture
,
*NL*
passed
out
of
sight
under
the
vaulted
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Archer
sat
down
on
the
bench
and
continued
to
gaze
at
the
awninged
*NL*
balcony
.
He
calculated
the
time
it
would
take
his
son
to
be
carried
up
*NL*
in
the
lift
to
the
fifth
floor
,
to
ring
the
bell
,
and
be
admitted
to
*NL*
the
hall
,
and
then
ushered
into
the
drawing-room
.
He
pictured
Dallas
*NL*
entering
that
room
with
his
quick
assured
step
and
his
delightful
*NL*
smile
,
and
wondered
if
the
people
were
right
who
said
that
his
boy
*NL*
``
took
after
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
tried
to
see
the
persons
already
in
the
room
--
for
probably
at
*NL*
that
sociable
hour
there
would
be
more
than
one
--
and
among
them
a
dark
*NL*
lady
,
pale
and
dark
,
who
would
look
up
quickly
,
half
rise
,
and
hold
out
*NL*
a
long
thin
hand
with
three
rings
on
it
...
He
thought
she
would
be
*NL*
sitting
in
a
sofa-corner
near
the
fire
,
with
azaleas
banked
behind
her
*NL*
on
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
more
real
to
me
here
than
if
I
went
up
,
''
he
suddenly
heard
*NL*
himself
say
;
and
the
fear
lest
that
last
shadow
of
reality
should
lose
*NL*
its
edge
kept
him
rooted
to
his
seat
as
the
minutes
succeeded
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
bench
in
the
thickening
dusk
,
his
eyes
*NL*
never
turning
from
the
balcony
.
At
length
a
light
shone
through
the
*NL*
windows
,
and
a
moment
later
a
man-servant
came
out
on
the
balcony
,
drew
*NL*
up
the
awnings
,
and
closed
the
shutters
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
,
as
if
it
had
been
the
signal
he
waited
for
,
Newland
Archer
got
*NL*
up
slowly
and
walked
back
alone
to
his
hotel
.

The

first
appeared
in
four
large

in
The

,
from
July

that

same
year
in
book
form
by
D.
Appleton

in
New

and
in

Wharton
made
extensive
stylistic
,
punctuation
,
and
spelling
*NL*
changes
and
revisions
between
the
serial
and
book
publication
,
and
more
*NL*
than
thirty
subsequent
changes
were
made
after
the
second
impression
of
*NL*
the
