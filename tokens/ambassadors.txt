Preface
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
state
the
subject
of
``
The
Ambassadors
,
''
*NL*
which
first
appeared
in
twelve
numbers
of
_
The
North
American
Review
_
*NL*
-LRB-
1903
-RRB-
and
was
published
as
a
whole
the
same
year
.
The
situation
*NL*
involved
is
gathered
up
betimes
,
that
is
in
the
second
chapter
of
Book
*NL*
Fifth
,
for
the
reader
's
benefit
,
into
as
few
words
as
possible
--
planted
*NL*
or
``
sunk
,
''
stiffly
and
saliently
,
in
the
centre
of
the
current
,
almost
*NL*
perhaps
to
the
obstruction
of
traffic
.
Never
can
a
composition
of
this
*NL*
sort
have
sprung
straighter
from
a
dropped
grain
of
suggestion
,
and
*NL*
never
can
that
grain
,
developed
,
overgrown
and
smothered
,
have
yet
*NL*
lurked
more
in
the
mass
as
an
independent
particle
.
The
whole
case
,
in
*NL*
fine
,
is
in
Lambert
Strether
's
irrepressible
outbreak
to
little
Bilham
*NL*
on
the
Sunday
afternoon
in
Gloriani
's
garden
,
the
candour
with
which
he
*NL*
yields
,
for
his
young
friend
's
enlightenment
,
to
the
charming
*NL*
admonition
of
that
crisis
.
The
idea
of
the
tale
resides
indeed
in
the
*NL*
very
fact
that
an
hour
of
such
unprecedented
ease
should
have
been
felt
*NL*
by
him
AS
a
crisis
,
and
he
is
at
pains
to
express
it
for
us
as
neatly
*NL*
as
we
could
desire
.
The
remarks
to
which
he
thus
gives
utterance
*NL*
contain
the
essence
of
``
The
Ambassadors
,
''
his
fingers
close
,
before
he
*NL*
has
done
,
round
the
stem
of
the
full-blown
flower
;
which
,
after
that
*NL*
fashion
,
he
continues
officiously
to
present
to
us
.
``
Live
all
you
can
;
*NL*
it
's
a
mistake
not
to
.
It
does
n't
so
much
matter
what
you
do
in
*NL*
particular
so
long
as
you
have
your
life
.
If
you
have
n't
had
that
what
*NL*
HAVE
you
had
?
I
'm
too
old
--
too
old
at
any
rate
for
what
I
see
.
What
*NL*
one
loses
one
loses
;
make
no
mistake
about
that
.
Still
,
we
have
the
*NL*
illusion
of
freedom
;
therefore
do
n't
,
like
me
to-day
,
be
without
the
*NL*
memory
of
that
illusion
.
I
was
either
,
at
the
right
time
,
too
stupid
or
*NL*
too
intelligent
to
have
it
,
and
now
I
'm
a
case
of
reaction
against
the
*NL*
mistake
.
Do
what
you
like
so
long
as
you
do
n't
make
it
.
For
it
WAS
a
*NL*
mistake
.
Live
,
live
!
''
Such
is
the
gist
of
Strether
's
appeal
to
the
*NL*
impressed
youth
,
whom
he
likes
and
whom
he
desires
to
befriend
;
the
*NL*
word
``
mistake
''
occurs
several
times
,
it
will
be
seen
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
his
remarks
--
which
gives
the
measure
of
the
signal
warning
he
feels
*NL*
attached
to
his
case
.
He
has
accordingly
missed
too
much
,
though
*NL*
perhaps
after
all
constitutionally
qualified
for
a
better
part
,
and
he
*NL*
wakes
up
to
it
in
conditions
that
press
the
spring
of
a
terrible
*NL*
question
.
WOULD
there
yet
perhaps
be
time
for
reparation
?
--
reparation
,
*NL*
that
is
,
for
the
injury
done
his
character
;
for
the
affront
,
he
is
*NL*
quite
ready
to
say
,
so
stupidly
put
upon
it
and
in
which
he
has
even
*NL*
himself
had
so
clumsy
a
hand
?
The
answer
to
which
is
that
he
now
at
*NL*
all
events
SEES
;
so
that
the
business
of
my
tale
and
the
march
of
my
*NL*
action
,
not
to
say
the
precious
moral
of
everything
,
is
just
my
*NL*
demonstration
of
this
process
of
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
exceed
the
closeness
with
which
the
whole
fits
again
into
*NL*
its
germ
.
That
had
been
given
me
bodily
,
as
usual
,
by
the
spoken
word
,
*NL*
for
I
was
to
take
the
image
over
exactly
as
I
happened
to
have
met
it
.
*NL*
A
friend
had
repeated
to
me
,
with
great
appreciation
,
a
thing
or
two
*NL*
said
to
him
by
a
man
of
distinction
,
much
his
senior
,
and
to
which
a
*NL*
sense
akin
to
that
of
Strether
's
melancholy
eloquence
might
be
*NL*
imputed
--
said
as
chance
would
have
,
and
so
easily
might
,
in
Paris
,
and
*NL*
in
a
charming
old
garden
attached
to
a
house
of
art
,
and
on
a
Sunday
*NL*
afternoon
of
summer
,
many
persons
of
great
interest
being
present
.
The
*NL*
observation
there
listened
to
and
gathered
up
had
contained
part
of
the
*NL*
``
note
''
that
I
was
to
recognise
on
the
spot
as
to
my
purpose
--
had
*NL*
contained
in
fact
the
greater
part
;
the
rest
was
in
the
place
and
the
*NL*
time
and
the
scene
they
sketched
:
these
constituents
clustered
and
*NL*
combined
to
give
me
further
support
,
to
give
me
what
I
may
call
the
*NL*
note
absolute
.
There
it
stands
,
accordingly
,
full
in
the
tideway
;
*NL*
driven
in
,
with
hard
taps
,
like
some
strong
stake
for
the
noose
of
a
*NL*
cable
,
the
swirl
of
the
current
roundabout
it
.
What
amplified
the
hint
*NL*
to
more
than
the
bulk
of
hints
in
general
was
the
gift
with
it
of
the
*NL*
old
Paris
garden
,
for
in
that
token
were
sealed
up
values
infinitely
*NL*
precious
.
There
was
of
course
the
seal
to
break
and
each
item
of
the
*NL*
packet
to
count
over
and
handle
and
estimate
;
but
somehow
,
in
the
light
*NL*
of
the
hint
,
all
the
elements
of
a
situation
of
the
sort
most
to
my
*NL*
taste
were
there
.
I
could
even
remember
no
occasion
on
which
,
so
*NL*
confronted
,
I
had
found
it
of
a
livelier
interest
to
take
stock
,
in
*NL*
this
fashion
,
of
suggested
wealth
.
For
I
think
,
verily
,
that
there
are
*NL*
degrees
of
merit
in
subjects
--
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
to
treat
even
*NL*
one
of
the
most
ambiguous
with
due
decency
we
must
for
the
time
,
for
*NL*
the
feverish
and
prejudiced
hour
,
at
least
figure
its
merit
and
its
*NL*
dignity
as
POSSIBLY
absolute
.
What
it
comes
to
,
doubtless
,
is
that
*NL*
even
among
the
supremely
good
--
since
with
such
alone
is
it
one
's
theory
*NL*
of
one
's
honour
to
be
concerned
--
there
is
an
ideal
BEAUTY
of
goodness
*NL*
the
invoked
action
of
which
is
to
raise
the
artistic
faith
to
its
*NL*
maximum
.
Then
truly
,
I
hold
,
one
's
theme
may
be
said
to
shine
,
and
*NL*
that
of
``
The
Ambassadors
,
''
I
confess
,
wore
this
glow
for
me
from
*NL*
beginning
to
end
.
Fortunately
thus
I
am
able
to
estimate
this
as
,
*NL*
frankly
,
quite
the
best
,
``
all
round
,
''
of
all
my
productions
;
any
*NL*
failure
of
that
justification
would
have
made
such
an
extreme
of
*NL*
complacency
publicly
fatuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
recall
then
in
this
connexion
no
moment
of
subjective
intermittence
,
*NL*
never
one
of
those
alarms
as
for
a
suspected
hollow
beneath
one
's
feet
,
*NL*
a
felt
ingratitude
in
the
scheme
adopted
,
under
which
confidence
fails
*NL*
and
opportunity
seems
but
to
mock
.
If
the
motive
of
``
The
Wings
of
the
*NL*
Dove
,
''
as
I
have
noted
,
was
to
worry
me
at
moments
by
a
sealing-up
of
*NL*
its
face
--
though
without
prejudice
to
its
again
,
of
a
sudden
,
fairly
*NL*
grimacing
with
expression
--
so
in
this
other
business
I
had
absolute
*NL*
conviction
and
constant
clearness
to
deal
with
;
it
had
been
a
frank
*NL*
proposition
,
the
whole
bunch
of
data
,
installed
on
my
premises
like
a
*NL*
monotony
of
fine
weather
.
-LRB-
The
order
of
composition
,
in
these
things
,
*NL*
I
may
mention
,
was
reversed
by
the
order
of
publication
;
the
earlier
*NL*
written
of
the
two
books
having
appeared
as
the
later
.
-RRB-
Even
under
the
*NL*
weight
of
my
hero
's
years
I
could
feel
my
postulate
firm
;
even
under
*NL*
the
strain
of
the
difference
between
those
of
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
*NL*
those
of
Chad
Newsome
,
a
difference
liable
to
be
denounced
as
shocking
,
*NL*
I
could
still
feel
it
serene
.
Nothing
resisted
,
nothing
betrayed
,
I
*NL*
seem
to
make
out
,
in
this
full
and
sound
sense
of
the
matter
;
it
shed
*NL*
from
any
side
I
could
turn
it
to
the
same
golden
glow
.
I
rejoiced
in
*NL*
the
promise
of
a
hero
so
mature
,
who
would
give
me
thereby
the
more
to
*NL*
bite
into
--
since
it
's
only
into
thickened
motive
and
accumulated
*NL*
character
,
I
think
,
that
the
painter
of
life
bites
more
than
a
little
.
*NL*
My
poor
friend
should
have
accumulated
character
,
certainly
;
or
rather
*NL*
would
be
quite
naturally
and
handsomely
possessed
of
it
,
in
the
sense
*NL*
that
he
would
have
,
and
would
always
have
felt
he
had
,
imagination
*NL*
galore
,
and
that
this
yet
would
n't
have
wrecked
him
.
It
was
*NL*
immeasurable
,
the
opportunity
to
``
do
''
a
man
of
imagination
,
for
if
*NL*
THERE
might
n't
be
a
chance
to
``
bite
,
''
where
in
the
world
might
it
be
?
*NL*
This
personage
of
course
,
so
enriched
,
would
n't
give
me
,
for
his
type
,
*NL*
imagination
in
PREDOMINANCE
or
as
his
prime
faculty
,
nor
should
I
,
in
*NL*
view
of
other
matters
,
have
found
that
convenient
.
So
particular
a
*NL*
luxury
--
some
occasion
,
that
is
,
for
study
of
the
high
gift
in
SUPREME
*NL*
command
of
a
case
or
of
a
career
--
would
still
doubtless
come
on
the
day
*NL*
I
should
be
ready
to
pay
for
it
;
and
till
then
might
,
as
from
far
back
,
*NL*
remain
hung
up
well
in
view
and
just
out
of
reach
.
The
comparative
case
*NL*
meanwhile
would
serve
--
it
was
only
on
the
minor
scale
that
I
had
*NL*
treated
myself
even
to
comparative
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
to
hasten
to
add
however
that
,
happy
stopgaps
as
the
minor
scale
*NL*
had
thus
yielded
,
the
instance
in
hand
should
enjoy
the
advantage
of
*NL*
the
full
range
of
the
major
;
since
most
immediately
to
the
point
was
*NL*
the
question
of
that
SUPPLEMENT
of
situation
logically
involved
in
our
*NL*
gentleman
's
impulse
to
deliver
himself
in
the
Paris
garden
on
the
*NL*
Sunday
afternoon
--
or
if
not
involved
by
strict
logic
then
all
ideally
*NL*
and
enchantingly
implied
in
it
.
-LRB-
I
say
``
ideally
,
''
because
I
need
*NL*
scarce
mention
that
for
development
,
for
expression
of
its
maximum
,
my
*NL*
glimmering
story
was
,
at
the
earliest
stage
,
to
have
nipped
the
thread
*NL*
of
connexion
with
the
possibilities
of
the
actual
reported
speaker
.
HE
*NL*
remains
but
the
happiest
of
accidents
;
his
actualities
,
all
too
*NL*
definite
,
precluded
any
range
of
possibilities
;
it
had
only
been
his
*NL*
charming
office
to
project
upon
that
wide
field
of
the
artist
's
*NL*
vision
--
which
hangs
there
ever
in
place
like
the
white
sheet
suspended
*NL*
for
the
figures
of
a
child
's
magic-lantern
--
a
more
fantastic
and
more
*NL*
moveable
shadow
.
-RRB-
No
privilege
of
the
teller
of
tales
and
the
handler
*NL*
of
puppets
is
more
delightful
,
or
has
more
of
the
suspense
and
the
*NL*
thrill
of
a
game
of
difficulty
breathlessly
played
,
than
just
this
*NL*
business
of
looking
for
the
unseen
and
the
occult
,
in
a
scheme
*NL*
half-grasped
,
by
the
light
or
,
so
to
speak
,
by
the
clinging
scent
,
of
*NL*
the
gage
already
in
hand
.
No
dreadful
old
pursuit
of
the
hidden
slave
*NL*
with
bloodhounds
and
the
rag
of
association
can
ever
,
for
``
excitement
,
''
*NL*
I
judge
,
have
bettered
it
at
its
best
.
For
the
dramatist
always
,
by
*NL*
the
very
law
of
his
genius
,
believes
not
only
in
a
possible
right
issue
*NL*
from
the
rightly-conceived
tight
place
;
he
does
much
more
than
this
--
he
*NL*
believes
,
irresistibly
,
in
the
necessary
,
the
precious
``
tightness
''
of
*NL*
the
place
-LRB-
whatever
the
issue
-RRB-
on
the
strength
of
any
respectable
hint
.
*NL*
It
being
thus
the
respectable
hint
that
I
had
with
such
avidity
picked
*NL*
up
,
what
would
be
the
story
to
which
it
would
most
inevitably
form
the
*NL*
centre
?
It
is
part
of
the
charm
attendant
on
such
questions
that
the
*NL*
``
story
,
''
with
the
omens
true
,
as
I
say
,
puts
on
from
this
stage
the
*NL*
authenticity
of
concrete
existence
.
It
then
is
,
essentially
--
it
begins
*NL*
to
be
,
though
it
may
more
or
less
obscurely
lurk
,
so
that
the
point
is
*NL*
not
in
the
least
what
to
make
of
it
,
but
only
,
very
delightfully
and
*NL*
very
damnably
,
where
to
put
one
's
hand
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
truth
resides
surely
much
of
the
interest
of
that
admirable
*NL*
mixture
for
salutary
application
which
we
know
as
art
.
Art
deals
with
*NL*
what
we
see
,
it
must
first
contribute
full-handed
that
ingredient
;
it
*NL*
plucks
its
material
,
otherwise
expressed
,
in
the
garden
of
life
--
which
*NL*
material
elsewhere
grown
is
stale
and
uneatable
.
But
it
has
no
sooner
*NL*
done
this
than
it
has
to
take
account
of
a
PROCESS
--
from
which
only
*NL*
when
it
's
the
basest
of
the
servants
of
man
,
incurring
ignominious
*NL*
dismissal
with
no
``
character
,
''
does
it
,
and
whether
under
some
muddled
*NL*
pretext
of
morality
or
on
any
other
,
pusillanimously
edge
away
.
The
*NL*
process
,
that
of
the
expression
,
the
literal
squeezing-out
,
of
value
is
*NL*
another
affair
--
with
which
the
happy
luck
of
mere
finding
has
little
to
*NL*
do
.
The
joys
of
finding
,
at
this
stage
,
are
pretty
well
over
;
that
*NL*
quest
of
the
subject
as
a
whole
by
``
matching
,
''
as
the
ladies
say
at
the
*NL*
shops
,
the
big
piece
with
the
snippet
,
having
ended
,
we
assume
,
with
a
*NL*
capture
.
The
subject
is
found
,
and
if
the
problem
is
then
transferred
*NL*
to
the
ground
of
what
to
do
with
it
the
field
opens
out
for
any
amount
*NL*
of
doing
.
This
is
precisely
the
infusion
that
,
as
I
submit
,
completes
*NL*
the
strong
mixture
.
It
is
on
the
other
hand
the
part
of
the
business
*NL*
that
can
least
be
likened
to
the
chase
with
horn
and
hound
.
It
's
all
a
*NL*
sedentary
part
--
involves
as
much
ciphering
,
of
sorts
,
as
would
merit
*NL*
the
highest
salary
paid
to
a
chief
accountant
.
Not
,
however
,
that
the
*NL*
chief
accountant
has
n't
HIS
gleams
of
bliss
;
for
the
felicity
,
or
at
*NL*
least
the
equilibrium
of
the
artist
's
state
dwells
less
,
surely
,
in
the
*NL*
further
delightful
complications
he
can
smuggle
in
than
in
those
he
*NL*
succeeds
in
keeping
out
.
He
sows
his
seed
at
the
risk
of
too
thick
a
*NL*
crop
;
wherefore
yet
again
,
like
the
gentlemen
who
audit
ledgers
,
he
*NL*
must
keep
his
head
at
any
price
.
In
consequence
of
all
which
,
for
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
matter
,
I
might
seem
here
to
have
my
choice
of
*NL*
narrating
my
``
hunt
''
for
Lambert
Strether
,
of
describing
the
capture
of
*NL*
the
shadow
projected
by
my
friend
's
anecdote
,
or
of
reporting
on
the
*NL*
occurrences
subsequent
to
that
triumph
.
But
I
had
probably
best
*NL*
attempt
a
little
to
glance
in
each
direction
;
since
it
comes
to
me
*NL*
again
and
again
,
over
this
licentious
record
,
that
one
's
bag
of
*NL*
adventures
,
conceived
or
conceivable
,
has
been
only
half-emptied
by
the
*NL*
mere
telling
of
one
's
story
.
It
depends
so
on
what
one
means
by
that
*NL*
equivocal
quantity
.
There
is
the
story
of
one
's
hero
,
and
then
,
thanks
*NL*
to
the
intimate
connexion
of
things
,
the
story
of
one
's
story
itself
.
I
*NL*
blush
to
confess
it
,
but
if
one
's
a
dramatist
one
's
a
dramatist
,
and
*NL*
the
latter
imbroglio
is
liable
on
occasion
to
strike
me
as
really
the
*NL*
more
objective
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
philosophy
imputed
to
him
in
that
beautiful
outbreak
,
the
hour
*NL*
there
,
amid
such
happy
provision
,
striking
for
him
,
would
have
been
*NL*
then
,
on
behalf
of
my
man
of
imagination
,
to
be
logically
and
,
as
the
*NL*
artless
craft
of
comedy
has
it
,
``
led
up
''
to
;
the
probable
course
to
*NL*
such
a
goal
,
the
goal
of
so
conscious
a
predicament
,
would
have
in
*NL*
short
to
be
finely
calculated
.
Where
has
he
come
from
and
why
has
he
*NL*
come
,
what
is
he
doing
-LRB-
as
we
Anglo-Saxons
,
and
we
only
,
say
,
in
our
*NL*
foredoomed
clutch
of
exotic
aids
to
expression
-RRB-
in
that
galere
?
To
*NL*
answer
these
questions
plausibly
,
to
answer
them
as
under
*NL*
cross-examination
in
the
witness-box
by
counsel
for
the
prosecution
,
in
*NL*
other
words
satisfactorily
to
account
for
Strether
and
for
his
*NL*
``
peculiar
tone
,
''
was
to
possess
myself
of
the
entire
fabric
.
At
the
*NL*
same
time
the
clue
to
its
whereabouts
would
lie
in
a
certain
principle
*NL*
of
probability
:
he
would
n't
have
indulged
in
his
peculiar
tone
without
*NL*
a
reason
;
it
would
take
a
felt
predicament
or
a
false
position
to
give
*NL*
him
so
ironic
an
accent
.
One
had
n't
been
noting
``
tones
''
all
one
's
life
*NL*
without
recognising
when
one
heard
it
the
voice
of
the
false
position
.
*NL*
The
dear
man
in
the
Paris
garden
was
then
admirably
and
unmistakeably
*NL*
IN
one
--
which
was
no
small
point
gained
;
what
next
accordingly
*NL*
concerned
us
was
the
determination
of
THIS
identity
.
One
could
only
go
*NL*
by
probabilities
,
but
there
was
the
advantage
that
the
most
general
of
*NL*
the
probabilities
were
virtual
certainties
.
Possessed
of
our
friend
's
*NL*
nationality
,
to
start
with
,
there
was
a
general
probability
in
his
*NL*
narrower
localism
;
which
,
for
that
matter
,
one
had
really
but
to
keep
*NL*
under
the
lens
for
an
hour
to
see
it
give
up
its
secrets
.
He
would
*NL*
have
issued
,
our
rueful
worthy
,
from
the
very
heart
of
New
England
--
at
*NL*
the
heels
of
which
matter
of
course
a
perfect
train
of
secrets
tumbled
*NL*
for
me
into
the
light
.
They
had
to
be
sifted
and
sorted
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
not
reproduce
the
detail
of
that
process
;
but
unmistakeably
they
were
*NL*
all
there
,
and
it
was
but
a
question
,
auspiciously
,
of
picking
among
*NL*
them
.
What
the
``
position
''
would
infallibly
be
,
and
why
,
on
his
hands
,
*NL*
it
had
turned
``
false
''
--
these
inductive
steps
could
only
be
as
rapid
as
*NL*
they
were
distinct
.
I
accounted
for
everything
--
and
``
everything
''
had
*NL*
by
this
time
become
the
most
promising
quantity
--
by
the
view
that
he
*NL*
had
come
to
Paris
in
some
state
of
mind
which
was
literally
undergoing
,
*NL*
as
a
result
of
new
and
unexpected
assaults
and
infusions
,
a
change
*NL*
almost
from
hour
to
hour
.
He
had
come
with
a
view
that
might
have
been
*NL*
figured
by
a
clear
green
liquid
,
say
,
in
a
neat
glass
phial
;
and
the
*NL*
liquid
,
once
poured
into
the
open
cup
of
APPLICATION
,
once
exposed
to
*NL*
the
action
of
another
air
,
had
begun
to
turn
from
green
to
red
,
or
*NL*
whatever
,
and
might
,
for
all
he
knew
,
be
on
its
way
to
purple
,
to
*NL*
black
,
to
yellow
.
At
the
still
wilder
extremes
represented
perhaps
,
*NL*
for
all
he
could
say
to
the
contrary
,
by
a
variability
so
violent
,
he
*NL*
would
at
first
,
naturally
,
but
have
gazed
in
surprise
and
alarm
;
*NL*
whereby
the
SITUATION
clearly
would
spring
from
the
play
of
wildness
*NL*
and
the
development
of
extremes
.
I
saw
in
a
moment
that
,
should
this
*NL*
development
proceed
both
with
force
and
logic
,
my
``
story
''
would
leave
*NL*
nothing
to
be
desired
.
There
is
always
,
of
course
,
for
the
*NL*
story-teller
,
the
irresistible
determinant
and
the
incalculable
*NL*
advantage
of
his
interest
in
the
story
AS
SUCH
;
it
is
ever
,
obviously
,
*NL*
overwhelmingly
,
the
prime
and
precious
thing
-LRB-
as
other
than
this
I
have
*NL*
never
been
able
to
see
it
-RRB-
;
as
to
which
what
makes
for
it
,
with
*NL*
whatever
headlong
energy
,
may
be
said
to
pale
before
the
energy
with
*NL*
which
it
simply
makes
for
itself
.
It
rejoices
,
none
the
less
,
at
its
*NL*
best
,
to
seem
to
offer
itself
in
a
light
,
to
seem
to
know
,
and
with
the
*NL*
very
last
knowledge
,
what
it
's
about
--
liable
as
it
yet
is
at
moments
to
*NL*
be
caught
by
us
with
its
tongue
in
its
cheek
and
absolutely
no
warrant
*NL*
but
its
splendid
impudence
.
Let
us
grant
then
that
the
impudence
is
*NL*
always
there
--
there
,
so
to
speak
,
for
grace
and
effect
and
ALLURE
;
*NL*
there
,
above
all
,
because
the
Story
is
just
the
spoiled
child
of
art
,
*NL*
and
because
,
as
we
are
always
disappointed
when
the
pampered
do
n't
*NL*
``
play
up
,
''
we
like
it
,
to
that
extent
,
to
look
all
its
character
.
It
*NL*
probably
does
so
,
in
truth
,
even
when
we
most
flatter
ourselves
that
we
*NL*
negotiate
with
it
by
treaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
which
,
again
,
is
but
to
say
that
the
STEPS
,
for
my
fable
,
placed
*NL*
themselves
with
a
prompt
and
,
as
it
were
,
functional
assurance
--
an
air
*NL*
quite
as
of
readiness
to
have
dispensed
with
logic
had
I
been
in
fact
*NL*
too
stupid
for
my
clue
.
Never
,
positively
,
none
the
less
,
as
the
links
*NL*
multiplied
,
had
I
felt
less
stupid
than
for
the
determination
of
poor
*NL*
Strether
's
errand
and
for
the
apprehension
of
his
issue
.
These
things
*NL*
continued
to
fall
together
,
as
by
the
neat
action
of
their
own
weight
*NL*
and
form
,
even
while
their
commentator
scratched
his
head
about
them
;
*NL*
he
easily
sees
now
that
they
were
always
well
in
advance
of
him
.
As
*NL*
the
case
completed
itself
he
had
in
fact
,
from
a
good
way
behind
,
to
*NL*
catch
up
with
them
,
breathless
and
a
little
flurried
,
as
he
best
could
.
*NL*
THE
false
position
,
for
our
belated
man
of
the
world
--
belated
because
*NL*
he
had
endeavoured
so
long
to
escape
being
one
,
and
now
at
last
had
*NL*
really
to
face
his
doom
--
the
false
position
for
him
,
I
say
,
was
*NL*
obviously
to
have
presented
himself
at
the
gate
of
that
boundless
*NL*
menagerie
primed
with
a
moral
scheme
of
the
most
approved
pattern
which
*NL*
was
yet
framed
to
break
down
on
any
approach
to
vivid
facts
;
that
is
to
*NL*
any
at
all
liberal
appreciation
of
them
.
There
would
have
been
of
*NL*
course
the
case
of
the
Strether
prepared
,
wherever
presenting
himself
,
*NL*
only
to
judge
and
to
feel
meanly
;
but
HE
would
have
moved
for
me
,
I
*NL*
confess
,
enveloped
in
no
legend
whatever
.
The
actual
man
's
note
,
from
*NL*
the
first
of
our
seeing
it
struck
,
is
the
note
of
discrimination
,
just
*NL*
as
his
drama
is
to
become
,
under
stress
,
the
drama
of
discrimination
.
*NL*
It
would
have
been
his
blest
imagination
,
we
have
seen
,
that
had
*NL*
already
helped
him
to
discriminate
;
the
element
that
was
for
so
much
of
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
my
cutting
thick
,
as
I
have
intimated
,
into
his
*NL*
intellectual
,
into
his
moral
substance
.
Yet
here
it
was
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
just
here
,
that
a
shade
for
a
moment
fell
across
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
dreadful
little
old
tradition
,
one
of
the
platitudes
of
*NL*
the
human
comedy
,
that
people
's
moral
scheme
DOES
break
down
in
Paris
;
*NL*
that
nothing
is
more
frequently
observed
;
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
*NL*
more
or
less
hypocritical
or
more
or
less
cynical
persons
annually
*NL*
visit
the
place
for
the
sake
of
the
probable
catastrophe
,
and
that
I
*NL*
came
late
in
the
day
to
work
myself
up
about
it
.
There
was
in
fine
the
*NL*
TRIVIAL
association
,
one
of
the
vulgarest
in
the
world
;
but
which
give
*NL*
me
pause
no
longer
,
I
think
,
simply
because
its
vulgarity
is
so
*NL*
advertised
.
The
revolution
performed
by
Strether
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
the
most
interesting
of
great
cities
was
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
any
betise
of
the
imputably
``
tempted
''
state
;
he
was
to
be
thrown
*NL*
forward
,
rather
,
thrown
quite
with
violence
,
upon
his
lifelong
trick
of
*NL*
intense
reflexion
:
which
friendly
test
indeed
was
to
bring
him
out
,
*NL*
through
winding
passages
,
through
alternations
of
darkness
and
light
,
*NL*
very
much
IN
Paris
,
but
with
the
surrounding
scene
itself
a
minor
*NL*
matter
,
a
mere
symbol
for
more
things
than
had
been
dreamt
of
in
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
Woollett
.
Another
surrounding
scene
would
have
done
as
*NL*
well
for
our
show
could
it
have
represented
a
place
in
which
Strether
's
*NL*
errand
was
likely
to
lie
and
his
crisis
to
await
him
.
The
LIKELY
place
*NL*
had
the
great
merit
of
sparing
me
preparations
;
there
would
have
been
*NL*
too
many
involved
--
not
at
all
impossibilities
,
only
rather
worrying
and
*NL*
delaying
difficulties
--
in
positing
elsewhere
Chad
Newsome
's
interesting
*NL*
relation
,
his
so
interesting
complexity
of
relations
.
Strether
's
*NL*
appointed
stage
,
in
fine
,
could
be
but
Chad
's
most
luckily
selected
*NL*
one
.
The
young
man
had
gone
in
,
as
they
say
,
for
circumjacent
charm
;
*NL*
and
where
he
would
have
found
it
,
by
the
turn
of
his
mind
,
most
*NL*
``
authentic
,
''
was
where
his
earnest
friend
's
analysis
would
most
find
*NL*
HIM
;
as
well
as
where
,
for
that
matter
,
the
former
's
whole
analytic
*NL*
faculty
would
be
led
such
a
wonderful
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Ambassadors
''
had
been
,
all
conveniently
,
``
arranged
for
''
;
its
first
*NL*
appearance
was
from
month
to
month
,
in
the
_
North
American
Review
_
*NL*
during
1903
,
and
I
had
been
open
from
far
back
to
any
pleasant
*NL*
provocation
for
ingenuity
that
might
reside
in
one
's
actively
*NL*
adopting
--
so
as
to
make
it
,
in
its
way
,
a
small
compositional
*NL*
law
--
recurrent
breaks
and
resumptions
.
I
had
made
up
my
mind
here
*NL*
regularly
to
exploit
and
enjoy
these
often
rather
rude
jolts
--
having
*NL*
found
,
as
I
believed
an
admirable
way
to
it
;
yet
every
question
of
form
*NL*
and
pressure
,
I
easily
remember
,
paled
in
the
light
of
the
major
*NL*
propriety
,
recognised
as
soon
as
really
weighed
;
that
of
employing
but
*NL*
one
centre
and
keeping
it
all
within
my
hero
's
compass
.
The
thing
was
*NL*
to
be
so
much
this
worthy
's
intimate
adventure
that
even
the
projection
*NL*
of
his
consciousness
upon
it
from
beginning
to
end
without
intermission
*NL*
or
deviation
would
probably
still
leave
a
part
of
its
value
for
him
,
*NL*
and
a
fortiori
for
ourselves
,
unexpressed
.
I
might
,
however
,
express
*NL*
every
grain
of
it
that
there
would
be
room
for
--
on
condition
of
*NL*
contriving
a
splendid
particular
economy
.
Other
persons
in
no
small
*NL*
number
were
to
people
the
scene
,
and
each
with
his
or
her
axe
to
grind
,
*NL*
his
or
her
situation
to
treat
,
his
or
her
coherency
not
to
fail
of
,
his
*NL*
or
her
relation
to
my
leading
motive
,
in
a
word
,
to
establish
and
carry
*NL*
on
.
But
Strether
's
sense
of
these
things
,
and
Strether
's
only
,
should
*NL*
avail
me
for
showing
them
;
I
should
know
them
but
through
his
more
or
*NL*
less
groping
knowledge
of
them
,
since
his
very
gropings
would
figure
*NL*
among
his
most
interesting
motions
,
and
a
full
observance
of
the
rich
*NL*
rigour
I
speak
of
would
give
me
more
of
the
effect
I
should
be
most
*NL*
``
after
''
than
all
other
possible
observances
together
.
It
would
give
me
*NL*
a
large
unity
,
and
that
in
turn
would
crown
me
with
the
grace
to
which
*NL*
the
enlightened
story-teller
will
at
any
time
,
for
his
interest
,
*NL*
sacrifice
if
need
be
all
other
graces
whatever
.
I
refer
of
course
to
*NL*
the
grace
of
intensity
,
which
there
are
ways
of
signally
achieving
and
*NL*
ways
of
signally
missing
--
as
we
see
it
,
all
round
us
,
helplessly
and
*NL*
woefully
missed
.
Not
that
it
is
n't
,
on
the
other
hand
,
a
virtue
*NL*
eminently
subject
to
appreciation
--
there
being
no
strict
,
no
absolute
*NL*
measure
of
it
;
so
that
one
may
hear
it
acclaimed
where
it
has
quite
*NL*
escaped
one
's
perception
,
and
see
it
unnoticed
where
one
has
gratefully
*NL*
hailed
it
.
After
all
of
which
I
am
not
sure
,
either
,
that
the
immense
*NL*
amusement
of
the
whole
cluster
of
difficulties
so
arrayed
may
not
*NL*
operate
,
for
the
fond
fabulist
,
when
judicious
not
less
than
fond
,
as
*NL*
his
best
of
determinants
.
That
charming
principle
is
always
there
,
at
*NL*
all
events
,
to
keep
interest
fresh
:
it
is
a
principle
,
we
remember
,
*NL*
essentially
ravenous
,
without
scruple
and
without
mercy
,
appeased
with
*NL*
no
cheap
nor
easy
nourishment
.
It
enjoys
the
costly
sacrifice
and
*NL*
rejoices
thereby
in
the
very
odour
of
difficulty
--
even
as
ogres
,
with
*NL*
their
``
Fee-faw-fum
!
''
rejoice
in
the
smell
of
the
blood
of
Englishmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
was
,
at
all
events
,
that
the
ultimate
,
though
after
all
so
*NL*
speedy
,
definition
of
my
gentleman
's
job
--
his
coming
out
,
all
solemnly
*NL*
appointed
and
deputed
,
to
``
save
''
Chad
,
and
his
then
finding
the
young
*NL*
man
so
disobligingly
and
,
at
first
,
so
bewilderingly
not
lost
that
a
*NL*
new
issue
altogether
,
in
the
connexion
,
prodigiously
faces
them
,
which
*NL*
has
to
be
dealt
with
in
a
new
light
--
promised
as
many
calls
on
*NL*
ingenuity
and
on
the
higher
branches
of
the
compositional
art
as
one
*NL*
could
possibly
desire
.
Again
and
yet
again
,
as
,
from
book
to
book
,
I
*NL*
proceed
with
my
survey
,
I
find
no
source
of
interest
equal
to
this
*NL*
verification
after
the
fact
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
and
the
more
in
detail
*NL*
the
better
,
of
the
scheme
of
consistency
``
gone
in
''
for
.
As
*NL*
always
--
since
the
charm
never
fails
--
the
retracing
of
the
process
from
*NL*
point
to
point
brings
back
the
old
illusion
.
The
old
intentions
bloom
*NL*
again
and
flower
--
in
spite
of
all
the
blossoms
they
were
to
have
*NL*
dropped
by
the
way
.
This
is
the
charm
,
as
I
say
,
of
adventure
*NL*
TRANSPOSED
--
the
thrilling
ups
and
downs
,
the
intricate
ins
and
outs
of
*NL*
the
compositional
problem
,
made
after
such
a
fashion
admirably
*NL*
objective
,
becoming
the
question
at
issue
and
keeping
the
author
's
*NL*
heart
in
his
mouth
.
Such
an
element
,
for
instance
,
as
his
intention
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Newsome
,
away
off
with
her
finger
on
the
pulse
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
,
should
yet
be
no
less
intensely
than
circuitously
*NL*
present
through
the
whole
thing
,
should
be
no
less
felt
as
to
be
*NL*
reckoned
with
than
the
most
direct
exhibition
,
the
finest
portrayal
at
*NL*
first
hand
could
make
her
,
such
a
sign
of
artistic
good
faith
,
I
say
,
*NL*
once
it
's
unmistakeably
there
,
takes
on
again
an
actuality
not
too
much
*NL*
impaired
by
the
comparative
dimness
of
the
particular
success
.
*NL*
Cherished
intention
too
inevitably
acts
and
operates
,
in
the
book
,
*NL*
about
fifty
times
as
little
as
I
had
fondly
dreamt
it
might
;
but
that
*NL*
scarce
spoils
for
me
the
pleasure
of
recognising
the
fifty
ways
in
*NL*
which
I
had
sought
to
provide
for
it
.
The
mere
charm
of
seeing
such
an
*NL*
idea
constituent
,
in
its
degree
;
the
fineness
of
the
measures
taken
--
a
*NL*
real
extension
,
if
successful
,
of
the
very
terms
and
possibilities
of
*NL*
representation
and
figuration
--
such
things
alone
were
,
after
this
*NL*
fashion
,
inspiring
,
such
things
alone
were
a
gage
of
the
probable
*NL*
success
of
that
dissimulated
calculation
with
which
the
whole
effort
*NL*
was
to
square
.
But
oh
the
cares
begotten
,
none
the
less
,
of
that
same
*NL*
``
judicious
''
sacrifice
to
a
particular
form
of
interest
!
One
's
work
*NL*
should
have
composition
,
because
composition
alone
is
positive
beauty
;
*NL*
but
all
the
while
--
apart
from
one
's
inevitable
consciousness
too
of
the
*NL*
dire
paucity
of
readers
ever
recognising
or
ever
missing
positive
*NL*
beauty
--
how
,
as
to
the
cheap
and
easy
,
at
every
turn
,
how
,
as
to
*NL*
immediacy
and
facility
,
and
even
as
to
the
commoner
vivacity
,
positive
*NL*
beauty
might
have
to
be
sweated
for
and
paid
for
!
Once
achieved
and
*NL*
installed
it
may
always
be
trusted
to
make
the
poor
seeker
feel
he
*NL*
would
have
blushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
for
failing
of
it
;
yet
,
*NL*
how
,
as
its
virtue
can
be
essentially
but
the
virtue
of
the
whole
,
the
*NL*
wayside
traps
set
in
the
interest
of
muddlement
and
pleading
but
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
moment
,
of
the
particular
bit
in
itself
,
have
to
be
kicked
*NL*
out
of
the
path
!
All
the
sophistications
in
life
,
for
example
,
might
*NL*
have
appeared
to
muster
on
behalf
of
the
menace
--
the
menace
to
a
bright
*NL*
variety
--
involved
in
Strether
's
having
all
the
subjective
``
say
,
''
as
it
*NL*
were
,
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
I
,
meanwhile
,
made
him
at
once
hero
and
historian
,
endowed
him
with
*NL*
the
romantic
privilege
of
the
``
first
person
''
--
the
darkest
abyss
of
*NL*
romance
this
,
inveterately
,
when
enjoyed
on
the
grand
scale
--
variety
,
*NL*
and
many
other
queer
matters
as
well
,
might
have
been
smuggled
in
by
a
*NL*
back
door
.
Suffice
it
,
to
be
brief
,
that
the
first
person
,
in
the
long
*NL*
piece
,
is
a
form
foredoomed
to
looseness
and
that
looseness
,
never
much
*NL*
my
affair
,
had
never
been
so
little
so
as
on
this
particular
occasion
.
*NL*
All
of
which
reflexions
flocked
to
the
standard
from
the
moment
--
a
very
*NL*
early
one
--
the
question
of
how
to
keep
my
form
amusing
while
sticking
*NL*
so
close
to
my
central
figure
and
constantly
taking
its
pattern
from
*NL*
him
had
to
be
faced
.
He
arrives
-LRB-
arrives
at
Chester
-RRB-
as
for
the
*NL*
dreadful
purpose
of
giving
his
creator
``
no
end
''
to
tell
about
*NL*
him
--
before
which
rigorous
mission
the
serenest
of
creators
might
well
*NL*
have
quailed
.
I
was
far
from
the
serenest
;
I
was
more
than
agitated
*NL*
enough
to
reflect
that
,
grimly
deprived
of
one
alternative
or
one
*NL*
substitute
for
``
telling
,
''
I
must
address
myself
tooth
and
nail
to
*NL*
another
.
I
could
n't
,
save
by
implication
,
make
other
persons
tell
EACH
*NL*
OTHER
about
him
--
blest
resource
,
blest
necessity
,
of
the
drama
,
which
*NL*
reaches
its
effects
of
unity
,
all
remarkably
,
by
paths
absolutely
*NL*
opposite
to
the
paths
of
the
novel
:
with
other
persons
,
save
as
they
*NL*
were
primarily
HIS
persons
-LRB-
not
he
primarily
but
one
of
theirs
-RRB-
,
I
had
*NL*
simply
nothing
to
do
.
I
had
relations
for
him
none
the
less
,
by
the
*NL*
mercy
of
Providence
,
quite
as
much
as
if
my
exhibition
was
to
be
a
*NL*
muddle
;
if
I
could
only
by
implication
and
a
show
of
consequence
make
*NL*
other
persons
tell
each
other
about
him
,
I
could
at
least
make
him
tell
*NL*
THEM
whatever
in
the
world
he
must
;
and
could
so
,
by
the
same
*NL*
token
--
which
was
a
further
luxury
thrown
in
--
see
straight
into
the
deep
*NL*
differences
between
what
that
could
do
for
me
,
or
at
all
events
for
*NL*
HIM
,
and
the
large
ease
of
``
autobiography
.
''
It
may
be
asked
why
,
if
*NL*
one
so
keeps
to
one
's
hero
,
one
should
n't
make
a
single
mouthful
of
*NL*
``
method
,
''
should
n't
throw
the
reins
on
his
neck
and
,
letting
them
flap
*NL*
there
as
free
as
in
``
Gil
Blas
''
or
in
``
David
Copperfield
,
''
equip
him
*NL*
with
the
double
privilege
of
subject
and
object
--
a
course
that
has
at
*NL*
least
the
merit
of
brushing
away
questions
at
a
sweep
.
The
answer
to
*NL*
which
is
,
I
think
,
that
one
makes
that
surrender
only
if
one
is
*NL*
prepared
NOT
to
make
certain
precious
discriminations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
first
person
''
then
,
so
employed
,
is
addressed
by
the
author
*NL*
directly
to
ourselves
,
his
possible
readers
,
whom
he
has
to
reckon
*NL*
with
,
at
the
best
,
by
our
English
tradition
,
so
loosely
and
vaguely
*NL*
after
all
,
so
little
respectfully
,
on
so
scant
a
presumption
of
*NL*
exposure
to
criticism
.
Strether
,
on
the
other
hand
,
encaged
and
*NL*
provided
for
as
``
The
Ambassadors
''
encages
and
provides
,
has
to
keep
in
*NL*
view
proprieties
much
stiffer
and
more
salutary
than
any
our
straight
*NL*
and
credulous
gape
are
likely
to
bring
home
to
him
,
has
exhibitional
*NL*
conditions
to
meet
,
in
a
word
,
that
forbid
the
terrible
FLUIDITY
of
*NL*
self-revelation
.
I
may
seem
not
to
better
the
case
for
my
*NL*
discrimination
if
I
say
that
,
for
my
first
care
,
I
had
thus
inevitably
*NL*
to
set
him
up
a
confidant
or
two
,
to
wave
away
with
energy
the
custom
*NL*
of
the
seated
mass
of
explanation
after
the
fact
,
the
inserted
block
of
*NL*
merely
referential
narrative
,
which
flourishes
so
,
to
the
shame
of
the
*NL*
modern
impatience
,
on
the
serried
page
of
Balzac
,
but
which
seems
*NL*
simply
to
appal
our
actual
,
our
general
weaker
,
digestion
.
``
Harking
*NL*
back
to
make
up
''
took
at
any
rate
more
doing
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
not
*NL*
only
than
the
reader
of
to-day
demands
,
but
than
he
will
tolerate
at
*NL*
any
price
any
call
upon
him
either
to
understand
or
remotely
to
*NL*
measure
;
and
for
the
beauty
of
the
thing
when
done
the
current
*NL*
editorial
mind
in
particular
appears
wholly
without
sense
.
It
is
not
,
*NL*
however
,
primarily
for
either
of
these
reasons
,
whatever
their
weight
,
*NL*
that
Strether
's
friend
Waymarsh
is
so
keenly
clutched
at
,
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
book
,
or
that
no
less
a
pounce
is
made
on
Maria
*NL*
Gostrey
--
without
even
the
pretext
,
either
,
of
HER
being
,
in
essence
,
*NL*
Strether
's
friend
.
She
is
the
reader
's
friend
much
rather
--
in
*NL*
consequence
of
dispositions
that
make
him
so
eminently
require
one
;
and
*NL*
she
acts
in
that
capacity
,
and
REALLY
in
that
capacity
alone
,
with
*NL*
exemplary
devotion
from
beginning
to
and
of
the
book
.
She
is
an
*NL*
enrolled
,
a
direct
,
aid
to
lucidity
;
she
is
in
fine
,
to
tear
off
her
*NL*
mask
,
the
most
unmitigated
and
abandoned
of
ficelles
.
Half
the
*NL*
dramatist
's
art
,
as
we
well
know
--
since
if
we
do
n't
it
's
not
the
fault
*NL*
of
the
proofs
that
lie
scattered
about
us
--
is
in
the
use
of
ficelles
;
*NL*
by
which
I
mean
in
a
deep
dissimulation
of
his
dependence
on
them
.
*NL*
Waymarsh
only
to
a
slighter
degree
belongs
,
in
the
whole
business
,
less
*NL*
to
my
subject
than
to
my
treatment
of
it
;
the
interesting
proof
,
in
*NL*
these
connexions
,
being
that
one
has
but
to
take
one
's
subject
for
the
*NL*
stuff
of
drama
to
interweave
with
enthusiasm
as
many
Gostreys
as
need
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
material
of
``
The
Ambassadors
,
''
conforming
in
this
respect
exactly
*NL*
to
that
of
``
The
Wings
of
the
Dove
,
''
published
just
before
it
,
is
taken
*NL*
absolutely
for
the
stuff
of
drama
;
so
that
,
availing
myself
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
given
me
by
this
edition
for
some
prefatory
remarks
on
the
*NL*
latter
work
,
I
had
mainly
to
make
on
its
behalf
the
point
of
its
scenic
*NL*
consistency
.
It
disguises
that
virtue
,
in
the
oddest
way
in
the
world
,
*NL*
by
just
LOOKING
,
as
we
turn
its
pages
,
as
little
scenic
as
possible
;
*NL*
but
it
sharply
divides
itself
,
just
as
the
composition
before
us
does
,
*NL*
into
the
parts
that
prepare
,
that
tend
in
fact
to
over-prepare
,
for
*NL*
scenes
,
and
the
parts
,
or
otherwise
into
the
scenes
,
that
justify
and
*NL*
crown
the
preparation
.
It
may
definitely
be
said
,
I
think
,
that
*NL*
everything
in
it
that
is
not
scene
-LRB-
not
,
I
of
course
mean
,
complete
and
*NL*
functional
scene
,
treating
ALL
the
submitted
matter
,
as
by
logical
*NL*
start
,
logical
turn
,
and
logical
finish
-RRB-
is
discriminated
preparation
,
*NL*
is
the
fusion
and
synthesis
of
picture
.
These
alternations
propose
*NL*
themselves
all
recogniseably
,
I
think
,
from
an
early
stage
,
as
the
very
*NL*
form
and
figure
of
``
The
Ambassadors
''
;
so
that
,
to
repeat
,
such
an
agent
*NL*
as
Miss
Gostrey
pre-engaged
at
a
high
salary
,
but
waits
in
the
draughty
*NL*
wing
with
her
shawl
and
her
smelling-salts
.
Her
function
speaks
at
*NL*
once
for
itself
,
and
by
the
time
she
has
dined
with
Strether
in
London
*NL*
and
gone
to
a
play
with
him
her
intervention
as
a
ficelle
is
,
I
hold
,
*NL*
expertly
justified
.
Thanks
to
it
we
have
treated
scenically
,
and
*NL*
scenically
alone
,
the
whole
lumpish
question
of
Strether
's
``
past
,
''
*NL*
which
has
seen
us
more
happily
on
the
way
than
anything
else
could
have
*NL*
done
;
we
have
strained
to
a
high
lucidity
and
vivacity
-LRB-
or
at
least
we
*NL*
hope
we
have
-RRB-
certain
indispensable
facts
;
we
have
seen
our
two
or
*NL*
three
immediate
friends
all
conveniently
and
profitably
in
``
action
''
;
to
*NL*
say
nothing
of
our
beginning
to
descry
others
,
of
a
remoter
intensity
,
*NL*
getting
into
motion
,
even
if
a
bit
vaguely
as
yet
,
for
our
further
*NL*
enrichment
.
Let
my
first
point
be
here
that
the
scene
in
question
,
*NL*
that
in
which
the
whole
situation
at
Woollett
and
the
complex
forces
*NL*
that
have
propelled
my
hero
to
where
this
lively
extractor
of
his
value
*NL*
and
distiller
of
his
essence
awaits
him
,
is
normal
and
entire
,
is
*NL*
really
an
excellent
STANDARD
scene
;
copious
,
comprehensive
,
and
*NL*
accordingly
never
short
,
but
with
its
office
as
definite
as
that
of
the
*NL*
hammer
on
the
gong
of
the
clock
,
the
office
of
expressing
ALL
THAT
IS
*NL*
IN
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
ficelle
''
character
of
the
subordinate
party
is
as
artfully
*NL*
dissimulated
,
throughout
,
as
may
be
,
and
to
that
extent
that
,
with
the
*NL*
seams
or
joints
of
Maria
Gostrey
's
ostensible
connectedness
taken
*NL*
particular
care
of
,
duly
smoothed
over
,
that
is
,
and
anxiously
kept
*NL*
from
showing
as
``
pieced
on
;
''
this
figure
doubtless
achieves
,
after
a
*NL*
fashion
,
something
of
the
dignity
of
a
prime
idea
:
which
circumstance
*NL*
but
shows
us
afresh
how
many
quite
incalculable
but
none
the
less
clear
*NL*
sources
of
enjoyment
for
the
infatuated
artist
,
how
many
copious
*NL*
springs
of
our
never-to-be-slighted
``
fun
''
for
the
reader
and
critic
*NL*
susceptible
of
contagion
,
may
sound
their
incidental
plash
as
soon
as
*NL*
an
artistic
process
begins
to
enjoy
free
development
.
Exquisite
--
in
*NL*
illustration
of
this
--
the
mere
interest
and
amusement
of
such
at
once
*NL*
``
creative
''
and
critical
questions
as
how
and
where
and
why
to
make
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
's
false
connexion
carry
itself
,
under
a
due
high
polish
,
as
a
*NL*
real
one
.
Nowhere
is
it
more
of
an
artful
expedient
for
mere
*NL*
consistency
of
form
,
to
mention
a
case
,
than
in
the
last
``
scene
''
of
the
*NL*
book
,
where
its
function
is
to
give
or
to
add
nothing
whatever
,
but
*NL*
only
to
express
as
vividly
as
possible
certain
things
quite
other
than
*NL*
itself
and
that
are
of
the
already
fixed
and
appointed
measure
.
Since
,
*NL*
however
,
all
art
is
EXPRESSION
,
and
is
thereby
vividness
,
one
was
to
*NL*
find
the
door
open
here
to
any
amount
of
delightful
dissimulation
.
*NL*
These
verily
are
the
refinements
and
ecstasies
of
method
--
amid
which
,
*NL*
or
certainly
under
the
influence
of
any
exhilarated
demonstration
of
*NL*
which
,
one
must
keep
one
's
head
and
not
lose
one
's
way
.
To
cultivate
*NL*
an
adequate
intelligence
for
them
and
to
make
that
sense
operative
is
*NL*
positively
to
find
a
charm
in
any
produced
ambiguity
of
appearance
that
*NL*
is
not
by
the
same
stroke
,
and
all
helplessly
,
an
ambiguity
of
sense
.
*NL*
To
project
imaginatively
,
for
my
hero
,
a
relation
that
has
nothing
to
*NL*
do
with
the
matter
-LRB-
the
matter
of
my
subject
-RRB-
but
has
everything
to
do
*NL*
with
the
manner
-LRB-
the
manner
of
my
presentation
of
the
same
-RRB-
and
yet
to
*NL*
treat
it
,
at
close
quarters
and
for
fully
economic
expression
's
*NL*
possible
sake
,
as
if
it
were
important
and
essential
--
to
do
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
and
yet
muddle
nothing
may
easily
become
,
as
one
goes
,
a
*NL*
signally
attaching
proposition
;
even
though
it
all
remains
but
part
and
*NL*
parcel
,
I
hasten
to
recognise
,
of
the
merely
general
and
related
*NL*
question
of
expressional
curiosity
and
expressional
decency
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
moved
to
add
after
so
much
insistence
on
the
scenic
side
of
my
*NL*
labour
that
I
have
found
the
steps
of
re-perusal
almost
as
much
waylaid
*NL*
here
by
quite
another
style
of
effort
in
the
same
signal
interest
--
or
*NL*
have
in
other
words
not
failed
to
note
how
,
even
so
associated
and
so
*NL*
discriminated
,
the
finest
proprieties
and
charms
of
the
non-scenic
may
,
*NL*
under
the
right
hand
for
them
,
still
keep
their
intelligibility
and
*NL*
assert
their
office
.
Infinitely
suggestive
such
an
observation
as
this
*NL*
last
on
the
whole
delightful
head
,
where
representation
is
concerned
,
*NL*
of
possible
variety
,
of
effective
expressional
change
and
contrast
.
One
*NL*
would
like
,
at
such
an
hour
as
this
,
for
critical
licence
,
to
go
into
*NL*
the
matter
of
the
noted
inevitable
deviation
-LRB-
from
too
fond
an
original
*NL*
vision
-RRB-
that
the
exquisite
treachery
even
of
the
straightest
execution
*NL*
may
ever
be
trusted
to
inflict
even
on
the
most
mature
plan
--
the
case
*NL*
being
that
,
though
one
's
last
reconsidered
production
always
seems
to
*NL*
bristle
with
that
particular
evidence
,
``
The
Ambassadors
''
would
place
a
*NL*
flood
of
such
light
at
my
service
.
I
must
attach
to
my
final
remark
*NL*
here
a
different
import
;
noting
in
the
other
connexion
I
just
glanced
*NL*
at
that
such
passages
as
that
of
my
hero
's
first
encounter
with
Chad
*NL*
Newsome
,
absolute
attestations
of
the
non-scenic
form
though
they
be
,
*NL*
yet
lay
the
firmest
hand
too
--
so
far
at
least
as
intention
goes
--
on
*NL*
representational
effect
.
To
report
at
all
closely
and
completely
of
*NL*
what
``
passes
''
on
a
given
occasion
is
inevitably
to
become
more
or
less
*NL*
scenic
;
and
yet
in
the
instance
I
allude
to
,
WITH
the
conveyance
,
*NL*
expressional
curiosity
and
expressional
decency
are
sought
and
arrived
*NL*
at
under
quite
another
law
.
The
true
inwardness
of
this
may
be
at
*NL*
bottom
but
that
one
of
the
suffered
treacheries
has
consisted
*NL*
precisely
,
for
Chad
's
whole
figure
and
presence
,
of
a
direct
*NL*
presentability
diminished
and
compromised
--
despoiled
,
that
is
,
of
its
*NL*
PROPORTIONAL
advantage
;
so
that
,
in
a
word
,
the
whole
economy
of
his
*NL*
author
's
relation
to
him
has
at
important
points
to
be
redetermined
.
*NL*
The
book
,
however
,
critically
viewed
,
is
touchingly
full
of
these
*NL*
disguised
and
repaired
losses
,
these
insidious
recoveries
,
these
*NL*
intensely
redemptive
consistencies
.
The
pages
in
which
Mamie
Pocock
*NL*
gives
her
appointed
and
,
I
ca
n't
but
think
,
duly
felt
lift
to
the
whole
*NL*
action
by
the
so
inscrutably-applied
side-stroke
or
short-cut
of
our
*NL*
just
watching
and
as
quite
at
an
angle
of
vision
as
yet
untried
,
her
*NL*
single
hour
of
suspense
in
the
hotel
salon
,
in
our
partaking
of
her
*NL*
concentrated
study
of
the
sense
of
matters
bearing
on
her
own
case
,
all
*NL*
the
bright
warm
Paris
afternoon
,
from
the
balcony
that
overlooks
the
*NL*
Tuileries
garden
--
these
are
as
marked
an
example
of
the
*NL*
representational
virtue
that
insists
here
and
there
on
being
,
for
the
*NL*
charm
of
opposition
and
renewal
,
other
than
the
scenic
.
It
would
n't
*NL*
take
much
to
make
me
further
argue
that
from
an
equal
play
of
such
*NL*
oppositions
the
book
gathers
an
intensity
that
fairly
adds
to
the
*NL*
dramatic
--
though
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
the
sum
of
all
*NL*
intensities
;
or
that
has
at
any
rate
nothing
to
fear
from
juxtaposition
*NL*
with
it
.
I
consciously
fail
to
shrink
in
fact
from
that
*NL*
extravagance
--
I
risk
it
rather
,
for
the
sake
of
the
moral
involved
;
*NL*
which
is
not
that
the
particular
production
before
us
exhausts
the
*NL*
interesting
questions
it
raises
,
but
that
the
Novel
remains
still
,
*NL*
under
the
right
persuasion
,
the
most
independent
,
most
elastic
,
most
*NL*
prodigious
of
literary
forms
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Book
First
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
first
question
,
when
he
reached
the
hotel
,
was
about
his
*NL*
friend
;
yet
on
his
learning
that
Waymarsh
was
apparently
not
to
arrive
*NL*
till
evening
he
was
not
wholly
disconcerted
.
A
telegram
from
him
*NL*
bespeaking
a
room
``
only
if
not
noisy
,
''
reply
paid
,
was
produced
for
the
*NL*
enquirer
at
the
office
,
so
that
the
understanding
they
should
meet
at
*NL*
Chester
rather
than
at
Liverpool
remained
to
that
extent
sound
.
The
*NL*
same
secret
principle
,
however
,
that
had
prompted
Strether
not
*NL*
absolutely
to
desire
Waymarsh
's
presence
at
the
dock
,
that
had
led
him
*NL*
thus
to
postpone
for
a
few
hours
his
enjoyment
of
it
,
now
operated
to
*NL*
make
him
feel
he
could
still
wait
without
disappointment
.
They
would
*NL*
dine
together
at
the
worst
,
and
,
with
all
respect
to
dear
old
*NL*
Waymarsh
--
if
not
even
,
for
that
matter
,
to
himself
--
there
was
little
*NL*
fear
that
in
the
sequel
they
should
n't
see
enough
of
each
other
.
The
*NL*
principle
I
have
just
mentioned
as
operating
had
been
,
with
the
most
*NL*
newly
disembarked
of
the
two
men
,
wholly
instinctive
--
the
fruit
of
a
*NL*
sharp
sense
that
,
delightful
as
it
would
be
to
find
himself
looking
,
*NL*
after
so
much
separation
,
into
his
comrade
's
face
,
his
business
would
*NL*
be
a
trifle
bungled
should
he
simply
arrange
for
this
countenance
to
*NL*
present
itself
to
the
nearing
steamer
as
the
first
``
note
,
''
of
Europe
.
*NL*
Mixed
with
everything
was
the
apprehension
,
already
,
on
Strether
's
*NL*
part
,
that
it
would
,
at
best
,
throughout
,
prove
the
note
of
Europe
in
*NL*
quite
a
sufficient
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
note
had
been
meanwhile
--
since
the
previous
afternoon
,
thanks
to
*NL*
this
happier
device
--
such
a
consciousness
of
personal
freedom
as
he
*NL*
had
n't
known
for
years
;
such
a
deep
taste
of
change
and
of
having
above
*NL*
all
for
the
moment
nobody
and
nothing
to
consider
,
as
promised
already
,
*NL*
if
headlong
hope
were
not
too
foolish
,
to
colour
his
adventure
with
*NL*
cool
success
.
There
were
people
on
the
ship
with
whom
he
had
easily
*NL*
consorted
--
so
far
as
ease
could
up
to
now
be
imputed
to
him
--
and
who
*NL*
for
the
most
part
plunged
straight
into
the
current
that
set
from
the
*NL*
landing-stage
to
London
;
there
were
others
who
had
invited
him
to
a
*NL*
tryst
at
the
inn
and
had
even
invoked
his
aid
for
a
``
look
round
''
at
the
*NL*
beauties
of
Liverpool
;
but
he
had
stolen
away
from
every
one
alike
,
had
*NL*
kept
no
appointment
and
renewed
no
acquaintance
,
had
been
indifferently
*NL*
aware
of
the
number
of
persons
who
esteemed
themselves
fortunate
in
*NL*
being
,
unlike
himself
,
``
met
,
''
and
had
even
independently
,
unsociably
,
*NL*
alone
,
without
encounter
or
relapse
and
by
mere
quiet
evasion
,
given
*NL*
his
afternoon
and
evening
to
the
immediate
and
the
sensible
.
They
*NL*
formed
a
qualified
draught
of
Europe
,
an
afternoon
and
an
evening
on
*NL*
the
banks
of
the
Mersey
,
but
such
as
it
was
he
took
his
potion
at
least
*NL*
undiluted
.
He
winced
a
little
,
truly
,
at
the
thought
that
Waymarsh
*NL*
might
be
already
at
Chester
;
he
reflected
that
,
should
he
have
to
*NL*
describe
himself
there
as
having
``
got
in
''
so
early
,
it
would
be
*NL*
difficult
to
make
the
interval
look
particularly
eager
;
but
he
was
like
*NL*
a
man
who
,
elatedly
finding
in
his
pocket
more
money
than
usual
,
*NL*
handles
it
a
while
and
idly
and
pleasantly
chinks
it
before
addressing
*NL*
himself
to
the
business
of
spending
.
That
he
was
prepared
to
be
vague
*NL*
to
Waymarsh
about
the
hour
of
the
ship
's
touching
,
and
that
he
both
*NL*
wanted
extremely
to
see
him
and
enjoyed
extremely
the
duration
of
*NL*
delay
--
these
things
,
it
is
to
be
conceived
,
were
early
signs
in
him
*NL*
that
his
relation
to
his
actual
errand
might
prove
none
of
the
*NL*
simplest
.
He
was
burdened
,
poor
Strether
--
it
had
better
be
confessed
*NL*
at
the
outset
--
with
the
oddity
of
a
double
consciousness
.
There
was
*NL*
detachment
in
his
zeal
and
curiosity
in
his
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
young
woman
in
the
glass
cage
had
held
up
to
him
across
her
*NL*
counter
the
pale-pink
leaflet
bearing
his
friend
's
name
,
which
she
*NL*
neatly
pronounced
,
he
turned
away
to
find
himself
,
in
the
hall
,
facing
*NL*
a
lady
who
met
his
eyes
as
with
an
intention
suddenly
determined
,
and
*NL*
whose
features
--
not
freshly
young
,
not
markedly
fine
,
but
on
happy
*NL*
terms
with
each
other
--
came
back
to
him
as
from
a
recent
vision
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
they
stood
confronted
;
then
the
moment
placed
her
:
he
had
*NL*
noticed
her
the
day
before
,
noticed
her
at
his
previous
inn
,
*NL*
where
--
again
in
the
hall
--
she
had
been
briefly
engaged
with
some
people
*NL*
of
his
own
ship
's
company
.
Nothing
had
actually
passed
between
them
,
*NL*
and
he
would
as
little
have
been
able
to
say
what
had
been
the
sign
of
*NL*
her
face
for
him
on
the
first
occasion
as
to
name
the
ground
of
his
*NL*
present
recognition
.
Recognition
at
any
rate
appeared
to
prevail
on
her
*NL*
own
side
as
well
--
which
would
only
have
added
to
the
mystery
.
All
she
*NL*
now
began
by
saying
to
him
nevertheless
was
that
,
having
chanced
to
*NL*
catch
his
enquiry
,
she
was
moved
to
ask
,
by
his
leave
,
if
it
were
*NL*
possibly
a
question
of
Mr.
Waymarsh
of
Milrose
Connecticut
--
Mr.
*NL*
Waymarsh
the
American
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
he
replied
,
``
my
very
well-known
friend
.
He
's
to
meet
me
*NL*
here
,
coming
up
from
Malvern
,
and
I
supposed
he
'd
already
have
arrived
.
*NL*
But
he
does
n't
come
till
later
,
and
I
'm
relieved
not
to
have
kept
him
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
him
?
''
Strether
wound
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
n't
till
after
he
had
spoken
that
he
became
aware
of
how
much
*NL*
there
had
been
in
him
of
response
;
when
the
tone
of
her
own
rejoinder
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
play
of
something
more
in
her
face
--
something
more
,
that
*NL*
is
,
than
its
apparently
usual
restless
light
--
seemed
to
notify
him
.
*NL*
``
I
've
met
him
at
Milrose
--
where
I
used
sometimes
,
a
good
while
ago
,
to
*NL*
stay
;
I
had
friends
there
who
were
friends
of
his
,
and
I
've
been
at
his
*NL*
house
.
I
wo
n't
answer
for
it
that
he
would
know
me
,
''
Strether
's
new
*NL*
acquaintance
pursued
;
``
but
I
should
be
delighted
to
see
him
.
Perhaps
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
``
I
shall
--
for
I
'm
staying
over
.
''
She
paused
while
our
*NL*
friend
took
in
these
things
,
and
it
was
as
if
a
good
deal
of
talk
had
*NL*
already
passed
.
They
even
vaguely
smiled
at
it
,
and
Strether
presently
*NL*
observed
that
Mr.
Waymarsh
would
,
no
doubt
,
be
easily
to
be
seen
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
appeared
to
affect
the
lady
as
if
she
might
have
advanced
too
*NL*
far
.
She
appeared
to
have
no
reserves
about
anything
.
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
he
wo
n't
care
!
''
--
and
she
immediately
thereupon
remarked
that
she
*NL*
believed
Strether
knew
the
Munsters
;
the
Munsters
being
the
people
he
*NL*
had
seen
her
with
at
Liverpool
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
n't
,
it
happened
,
know
the
Munsters
well
enough
to
give
the
*NL*
case
much
of
a
lift
;
so
that
they
were
left
together
as
if
over
the
*NL*
mere
laid
table
of
conversation
.
Her
qualification
of
the
mentioned
*NL*
connexion
had
rather
removed
than
placed
a
dish
,
and
there
seemed
*NL*
nothing
else
to
serve
.
Their
attitude
remained
,
none
the
less
,
that
of
*NL*
not
forsaking
the
board
;
and
the
effect
of
this
in
turn
was
to
give
*NL*
them
the
appearance
of
having
accepted
each
other
with
an
absence
of
*NL*
preliminaries
practically
complete
.
They
moved
along
the
hall
*NL*
together
,
and
Strether
's
companion
threw
off
that
the
hotel
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
a
garden
.
He
was
aware
by
this
time
of
his
strange
*NL*
inconsequence
:
he
had
shirked
the
intimacies
of
the
steamer
and
had
*NL*
muffled
the
shock
of
Waymarsh
only
to
find
himself
forsaken
,
in
this
*NL*
sudden
case
,
both
of
avoidance
and
of
caution
.
He
passed
,
under
this
*NL*
unsought
protection
and
before
he
had
so
much
as
gone
up
to
his
room
,
*NL*
into
the
garden
of
the
hotel
,
and
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
had
agreed
*NL*
to
meet
there
again
,
as
soon
as
he
should
have
made
himself
tidy
,
the
*NL*
dispenser
of
such
good
assurances
.
He
wanted
to
look
at
the
town
,
and
*NL*
they
would
forthwith
look
together
.
It
was
almost
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
in
possession
and
received
him
as
a
guest
.
Her
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
place
presented
her
in
a
manner
as
a
hostess
,
and
Strether
had
a
rueful
*NL*
glance
for
the
lady
in
the
glass
cage
.
It
was
as
if
this
personage
had
*NL*
seen
herself
instantly
superseded
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
came
down
,
what
his
hostess
saw
,
what
*NL*
she
might
have
taken
in
with
a
vision
kindly
adjusted
,
was
the
lean
,
*NL*
the
slightly
loose
figure
of
a
man
of
the
middle
height
and
something
*NL*
more
perhaps
than
the
middle
age
--
a
man
of
five-and-fifty
,
whose
most
*NL*
immediate
signs
were
a
marked
bloodless
brownness
of
face
,
a
thick
dark
*NL*
moustache
,
of
characteristically
American
cut
,
growing
strong
and
*NL*
falling
low
,
a
head
of
hair
still
abundant
but
irregularly
streaked
*NL*
with
grey
,
and
a
nose
of
bold
free
prominence
,
the
even
line
,
the
high
*NL*
finish
,
as
it
might
have
been
called
,
of
which
,
had
a
certain
effect
of
*NL*
mitigation
.
A
perpetual
pair
of
glasses
astride
of
this
fine
ridge
,
*NL*
and
a
line
,
unusually
deep
and
drawn
,
the
prolonged
pen-stroke
of
time
,
*NL*
accompanying
the
curve
of
the
moustache
from
nostril
to
chin
,
did
*NL*
something
to
complete
the
facial
furniture
that
an
attentive
observer
*NL*
would
have
seen
catalogued
,
on
the
spot
,
in
the
vision
of
the
other
*NL*
party
to
Strether
's
appointment
.
She
waited
for
him
in
the
garden
,
the
*NL*
other
party
,
drawing
on
a
pair
of
singularly
fresh
soft
and
elastic
*NL*
light
gloves
and
presenting
herself
with
a
superficial
readiness
which
,
*NL*
as
he
approached
her
over
the
small
smooth
lawn
and
in
the
watery
*NL*
English
sunshine
,
he
might
,
with
his
rougher
preparation
,
have
marked
*NL*
as
the
model
for
such
an
occasion
.
She
had
,
this
lady
,
a
perfect
plain
*NL*
propriety
,
an
expensive
subdued
suitability
,
that
her
companion
was
not
*NL*
free
to
analyse
,
but
that
struck
him
,
so
that
his
consciousness
of
it
*NL*
was
instantly
acute
,
as
a
quality
quite
new
to
him
.
Before
reaching
*NL*
her
he
stopped
on
the
grass
and
went
through
the
form
of
feeling
for
*NL*
something
,
possibly
forgotten
,
in
the
light
overcoat
he
carried
on
his
*NL*
arm
;
yet
the
essence
of
the
act
was
no
more
than
the
impulse
to
gain
*NL*
time
.
Nothing
could
have
been
odder
than
Strether
's
sense
of
himself
*NL*
as
at
that
moment
launched
in
something
of
which
the
sense
would
be
*NL*
quite
disconnected
from
the
sense
of
his
past
and
which
was
literally
*NL*
beginning
there
and
then
.
It
had
begun
in
fact
already
upstairs
and
*NL*
before
the
dressing
glass
that
struck
him
as
blocking
further
,
so
*NL*
strangely
,
the
dimness
of
the
window
of
his
dull
bedroom
;
begun
with
a
*NL*
sharper
survey
of
the
elements
of
Appearance
than
he
had
for
a
long
*NL*
time
been
moved
to
make
.
He
had
during
those
moments
felt
these
*NL*
elements
to
be
not
so
much
to
his
hand
as
he
should
have
liked
,
and
*NL*
then
had
fallen
back
on
the
thought
that
they
were
precisely
a
matter
*NL*
as
to
which
help
was
supposed
to
come
from
what
he
was
about
to
do
.
He
*NL*
was
about
to
go
up
to
London
,
so
that
hat
and
necktie
might
wait
.
What
*NL*
had
come
as
straight
to
him
as
a
ball
in
a
well-played
game
--
and
caught
*NL*
moreover
not
less
neatly
--
was
just
the
air
,
in
the
person
of
his
*NL*
friend
,
of
having
seen
and
chosen
,
the
air
of
achieved
possession
of
*NL*
those
vague
qualities
and
quantities
that
collectively
figured
to
him
*NL*
as
the
advantage
snatched
from
lucky
chances
.
Without
pomp
or
*NL*
circumstance
,
certainly
,
as
her
original
address
to
him
,
equally
with
*NL*
his
own
response
,
had
been
,
he
would
have
sketched
to
himself
his
*NL*
impression
of
her
as
:
``
Well
,
she
's
more
thoroughly
civilized
--
!
''
If
*NL*
``
More
thoroughly
than
WHOM
?
''
would
not
have
been
for
him
a
sequel
to
*NL*
this
remark
,
that
was
just
by
reason
of
his
deep
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
bearing
of
his
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
amusement
,
at
all
events
,
of
a
civilisation
intenser
was
*NL*
what
--
familiar
compatriot
as
she
was
,
with
the
full
tone
of
the
*NL*
compatriot
and
the
rattling
link
not
with
mystery
but
only
with
dear
*NL*
dyspeptic
Waymarsh
--
she
appeared
distinctly
to
promise
.
His
pause
*NL*
while
he
felt
in
his
overcoat
was
positively
the
pause
of
confidence
,
*NL*
and
it
enabled
his
eyes
to
make
out
as
much
of
a
case
for
her
,
in
*NL*
proportion
,
as
her
own
made
out
for
himself
.
She
affected
him
as
*NL*
almost
insolently
young
;
but
an
easily
carried
five-and-thirty
could
*NL*
still
do
that
.
She
was
,
however
,
like
himself
marked
and
wan
;
only
it
*NL*
naturally
could
n't
have
been
known
to
him
how
much
a
spectator
looking
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
might
have
discerned
that
they
had
in
common
.
It
*NL*
would
n't
for
such
a
spectator
have
been
altogether
insupposable
that
,
*NL*
each
so
finely
brown
and
so
sharply
spare
,
each
confessing
so
to
dents
*NL*
of
surface
and
aids
to
sight
,
to
a
disproportionate
nose
and
a
head
*NL*
delicately
or
grossly
grizzled
,
they
might
have
been
brother
and
*NL*
sister
.
On
this
ground
indeed
there
would
have
been
a
residuum
of
*NL*
difference
;
such
a
sister
having
surely
known
in
respect
to
such
a
*NL*
brother
the
extremity
of
separation
,
and
such
a
brother
now
feeling
in
*NL*
respect
to
such
a
sister
the
extremity
of
surprise
.
Surprise
,
it
was
*NL*
true
,
was
not
on
the
other
hand
what
the
eyes
of
Strether
's
friend
most
*NL*
showed
him
while
she
gave
him
,
stroking
her
gloves
smoother
,
the
time
*NL*
he
appreciated
.
They
had
taken
hold
of
him
straightway
measuring
him
*NL*
up
and
down
as
if
they
knew
how
;
as
if
he
were
human
material
they
had
*NL*
already
in
some
sort
handled
.
Their
possessor
was
in
truth
,
it
may
be
*NL*
communicated
,
the
mistress
of
a
hundred
cases
or
categories
,
*NL*
receptacles
of
the
mind
,
subdivisions
for
convenience
,
in
which
,
from
a
*NL*
full
experience
,
she
pigeon-holed
her
fellow
mortals
with
a
hand
as
*NL*
free
as
that
of
a
compositor
scattering
type
.
She
was
as
equipped
in
*NL*
this
particular
as
Strether
was
the
reverse
,
and
it
made
an
opposition
*NL*
between
them
which
he
might
well
have
shrunk
from
submitting
to
if
he
*NL*
had
fully
suspected
it
.
So
far
as
he
did
suspect
it
he
was
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
after
a
short
shake
of
his
consciousness
,
as
pleasantly
*NL*
passive
as
might
be
.
He
really
had
a
sort
of
sense
of
what
she
knew
.
*NL*
He
had
quite
the
sense
that
she
knew
things
he
did
n't
,
and
though
this
*NL*
was
a
concession
that
in
general
he
found
not
easy
to
make
to
women
,
he
*NL*
made
it
now
as
good-humouredly
as
if
it
lifted
a
burden
.
His
eyes
were
*NL*
so
quiet
behind
his
eternal
nippers
that
they
might
almost
have
been
*NL*
absent
without
changing
his
face
,
which
took
its
expression
mainly
,
and
*NL*
not
least
its
stamp
of
sensibility
,
from
other
sources
,
surface
and
*NL*
grain
and
form
.
He
joined
his
guide
in
an
instant
,
and
then
felt
she
*NL*
had
profited
still
better
than
he
by
his
having
been
for
the
moments
*NL*
just
mentioned
,
so
at
the
disposal
of
her
intelligence
.
She
knew
even
*NL*
intimate
things
about
him
that
he
had
n't
yet
told
her
and
perhaps
never
*NL*
would
.
He
was
n't
unaware
that
he
had
told
her
rather
remarkably
many
*NL*
for
the
time
,
but
these
were
not
the
real
ones
.
Some
of
the
real
ones
,
*NL*
however
,
precisely
,
were
what
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
to
pass
again
through
the
hall
of
the
inn
to
get
into
the
*NL*
street
,
and
it
was
here
she
presently
checked
him
with
a
question
.
*NL*
``
Have
you
looked
up
my
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
only
stop
with
a
laugh
.
``
Have
you
looked
up
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
--
as
soon
as
you
left
me
.
I
went
to
the
office
and
asked
.
*NL*
Had
n't
YOU
better
do
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
.
``
Find
out
who
you
are
?
--
after
the
uplifted
young
woman
*NL*
there
has
seen
us
thus
scrape
acquaintance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
on
her
side
now
at
the
shade
of
alarm
in
his
amusement
.
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
a
reason
the
more
?
If
what
you
're
afraid
of
is
the
injury
*NL*
for
me
--
my
being
seen
to
walk
off
with
a
gentleman
who
has
to
ask
who
I
*NL*
am
--
I
assure
you
I
do
n't
in
the
least
mind
.
Here
,
however
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
``
is
my
card
,
and
as
I
find
there
's
something
else
again
I
*NL*
have
to
say
at
the
office
,
you
can
just
study
it
during
the
moment
I
*NL*
leave
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
him
after
he
had
taken
from
her
the
small
pasteboard
she
had
*NL*
extracted
from
her
pocket-book
,
and
he
had
extracted
another
from
his
*NL*
own
,
to
exchange
with
it
,
before
she
came
back
.
He
read
thus
the
*NL*
simple
designation
``
Maria
Gostrey
,
''
to
which
was
attached
,
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
card
,
with
a
number
,
the
name
of
a
street
,
presumably
in
Paris
,
*NL*
without
other
appreciable
identity
than
its
foreignness
.
He
put
the
*NL*
card
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
keeping
his
own
meanwhile
in
evidence
;
*NL*
and
as
he
leaned
against
the
door-post
he
met
with
the
smile
of
a
*NL*
straying
thought
what
the
expanse
before
the
hotel
offered
to
his
view
.
*NL*
It
was
positively
droll
to
him
that
he
should
already
have
Maria
*NL*
Gostrey
,
whoever
she
was
--
of
which
he
had
n't
really
the
least
idea
--
in
*NL*
a
place
of
safe
keeping
.
He
had
somehow
an
assurance
that
he
should
*NL*
carefully
preserve
the
little
token
he
had
just
tucked
in
.
He
gazed
*NL*
with
unseeing
lingering
eyes
as
he
followed
some
of
the
implications
of
*NL*
his
act
,
asking
himself
if
he
really
felt
admonished
to
qualify
it
as
*NL*
disloyal
.
It
was
prompt
,
it
was
possibly
even
premature
,
and
there
was
*NL*
little
doubt
of
the
expression
of
face
the
sight
of
it
would
have
*NL*
produced
in
a
certain
person
.
But
if
it
was
``
wrong
''
--
why
then
he
had
*NL*
better
not
have
come
out
at
all
.
At
this
,
poor
man
,
had
he
*NL*
already
--
and
even
before
meeting
Waymarsh
--
arrived
.
He
had
believed
he
*NL*
had
a
limit
,
but
the
limit
had
been
transcended
within
thirty-six
*NL*
hours
.
By
how
long
a
space
on
the
plane
of
manners
or
even
of
morals
,
*NL*
moreover
,
he
felt
still
more
sharply
after
Maria
Gostrey
had
come
back
*NL*
to
him
and
with
a
gay
decisive
``
So
now
--
!
''
led
him
forth
into
the
*NL*
world
.
This
counted
,
it
struck
him
as
he
walked
beside
her
with
his
*NL*
overcoat
on
an
arm
,
his
umbrella
under
another
and
his
personal
*NL*
pasteboard
a
little
stiffly
retained
between
forefinger
and
thumb
,
this
*NL*
struck
him
as
really
,
in
comparison
his
introduction
to
things
.
It
*NL*
had
n't
been
``
Europe
''
at
Liverpool
no
--
not
even
in
the
dreadful
*NL*
delightful
impressive
streets
the
night
before
--
to
the
extent
his
*NL*
present
companion
made
it
so
.
She
had
n't
yet
done
that
so
much
as
*NL*
when
,
after
their
walk
had
lasted
a
few
minutes
and
he
had
had
time
to
*NL*
wonder
if
a
couple
of
sidelong
glances
from
her
meant
that
he
had
best
*NL*
have
put
on
gloves
she
almost
pulled
him
up
with
an
amused
challenge
.
*NL*
``
But
why
--
fondly
as
it
's
so
easy
to
imagine
your
clinging
to
it
--
do
n't
*NL*
you
put
it
away
?
Or
if
it
's
an
inconvenience
to
you
to
carry
it
,
one
's
*NL*
often
glad
to
have
one
's
card
back
.
The
fortune
one
spends
in
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
saw
both
that
his
way
of
marching
with
his
own
prepared
tribute
*NL*
had
affected
her
as
a
deviation
in
one
of
those
directions
he
could
n't
*NL*
yet
measure
,
and
that
she
supposed
this
emblem
to
be
still
the
one
he
*NL*
had
received
from
her
.
He
accordingly
handed
her
the
card
as
if
in
*NL*
restitution
,
but
as
soon
as
she
had
it
she
felt
the
difference
and
,
*NL*
with
her
eyes
on
it
,
stopped
short
for
apology
.
``
I
like
,
''
she
observed
,
*NL*
``
your
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
answered
,
``
you
wo
n't
have
heard
of
it
!
''
Yet
he
had
his
reasons
*NL*
for
not
being
sure
but
that
she
perhaps
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
it
was
but
too
visible
!
She
read
it
over
again
as
one
who
had
never
*NL*
seen
it
.
''
`
Mr.
Lewis
Lambert
Strether
'
''
--
she
sounded
it
almost
as
*NL*
freely
as
for
any
stranger
.
She
repeated
however
that
she
liked
*NL*
it
--
``
particularly
the
Lewis
Lambert
.
It
's
the
name
of
a
novel
of
*NL*
Balzac
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
know
that
!
''
said
Strether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
novel
's
an
awfully
bad
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
too
,
''
Strether
smiled
.
To
which
he
added
with
an
*NL*
irrelevance
that
was
only
superficial
:
``
I
come
from
Woollett
*NL*
Massachusetts
.
''
It
made
her
for
some
reason
--
the
irrelevance
or
*NL*
whatever
--
laugh
.
Balzac
had
described
many
cities
,
but
had
n't
*NL*
described
Woollett
Massachusetts
.
``
You
say
that
,
''
she
returned
,
``
as
if
*NL*
you
wanted
one
immediately
to
know
the
worst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
think
it
's
a
thing
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
you
must
already
have
made
*NL*
out
.
I
feel
it
so
that
I
certainly
must
look
it
,
speak
it
,
and
,
as
*NL*
people
say
there
,
`
act
'
it
.
It
sticks
out
of
me
,
and
you
knew
surely
*NL*
for
yourself
as
soon
as
you
looked
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
fact
of
where
I
come
from
.
There
at
any
rate
it
IS
;
so
that
*NL*
you
wo
n't
be
able
,
if
anything
happens
,
to
say
I
've
not
been
straight
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
''
--
and
Miss
Gostrey
looked
really
interested
in
the
point
he
had
*NL*
made
.
``
But
what
do
you
think
of
as
happening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
n't
shy
--
which
was
rather
anomalous
--
Strether
gazed
about
*NL*
without
meeting
her
eyes
;
a
motion
that
was
frequent
with
him
in
talk
,
*NL*
yet
of
which
his
words
often
seemed
not
at
all
the
effect
.
``
Why
that
*NL*
you
should
find
me
too
hopeless
.
''
With
which
they
walked
on
again
*NL*
together
while
she
answered
,
as
they
went
,
that
the
most
``
hopeless
''
of
*NL*
her
countryfolk
were
in
general
precisely
those
she
liked
best
.
All
*NL*
sorts
of
other
pleasant
small
things-small
things
that
were
yet
large
*NL*
for
him
--
flowered
in
the
air
of
the
occasion
,
but
the
bearing
of
the
*NL*
occasion
itself
on
matters
still
remote
concerns
us
too
closely
to
*NL*
permit
us
to
multiply
our
illustrations
.
Two
or
three
,
however
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
we
should
perhaps
regret
to
lose
.
The
tortuous
wall
--
girdle
,
*NL*
long
since
snapped
,
of
the
little
swollen
city
,
half
held
in
place
by
*NL*
careful
civic
hands
--
wanders
in
narrow
file
between
parapets
smoothed
*NL*
by
peaceful
generations
,
pausing
here
and
there
for
a
dismantled
gate
*NL*
or
a
bridged
gap
,
with
rises
and
drops
,
steps
up
and
steps
down
,
queer
*NL*
twists
,
queer
contacts
,
peeps
into
homely
streets
and
under
the
brows
*NL*
of
gables
,
views
of
cathedral
tower
and
waterside
fields
,
of
huddled
*NL*
English
town
and
ordered
English
country
.
Too
deep
almost
for
words
*NL*
was
the
delight
of
these
things
to
Strether
;
yet
as
deeply
mixed
with
*NL*
it
were
certain
images
of
his
inward
picture
.
He
had
trod
this
walks
*NL*
in
the
far-off
time
,
at
twenty-five
;
but
that
,
instead
of
spoiling
it
,
*NL*
only
enriched
it
for
present
feeling
and
marked
his
renewal
as
a
thing
*NL*
substantial
enough
to
share
.
It
was
with
Waymarsh
he
should
have
*NL*
shared
it
,
and
he
was
now
accordingly
taking
from
him
something
that
*NL*
was
his
due
.
He
looked
repeatedly
at
his
watch
,
and
when
he
had
done
*NL*
so
for
the
fifth
time
Miss
Gostrey
took
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
doing
something
that
you
think
not
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
touched
the
place
that
he
quite
changed
colour
and
his
laugh
grew
*NL*
almost
awkward
.
``
Am
I
enjoying
it
as
much
as
THAT
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
enjoying
it
,
I
think
,
so
much
as
you
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
''
--
he
appeared
thoughtfully
to
agree
.
``
Great
is
my
privilege
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
it
's
not
your
privilege
!
It
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
.
It
has
to
*NL*
do
with
yourself
.
Your
failure
's
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
there
you
are
!
''
he
laughed
.
``
It
's
the
failure
of
Woollett
.
THAT
'S
*NL*
general
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
failure
to
enjoy
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
explained
,
``
is
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
Woollett
is
n't
sure
it
ought
to
enjoy
.
If
it
were
it
*NL*
would
.
But
it
has
n't
,
poor
thing
,
''
Strether
continued
,
``
any
one
to
*NL*
show
it
how
.
It
's
not
like
me
.
I
have
somebody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
stopped
,
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
--
constantly
pausing
,
in
*NL*
their
stroll
,
for
the
sharper
sense
of
what
they
saw
--
and
Strether
*NL*
rested
on
one
of
the
high
sides
of
the
old
stony
groove
of
the
little
*NL*
rampart
.
He
leaned
back
on
this
support
with
his
face
to
the
tower
of
*NL*
the
cathedral
,
now
admirably
commanded
by
their
station
,
the
high
*NL*
red-brown
mass
,
square
and
subordinately
spired
and
crocketed
,
*NL*
retouched
and
restored
,
but
charming
to
his
long-sealed
eyes
and
with
*NL*
the
first
swallows
of
the
year
weaving
their
flight
all
round
it
.
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
lingered
near
him
,
full
of
an
air
,
to
which
she
more
and
more
*NL*
justified
her
right
,
of
understanding
the
effect
of
things
.
She
quite
*NL*
concurred
.
``
You
've
indeed
somebody
.
''
And
she
added
:
``
I
wish
you
WOULD
*NL*
let
me
show
you
how
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
'm
afraid
of
you
!
''
he
cheerfully
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
on
him
a
moment
,
through
her
glasses
and
through
his
own
,
a
*NL*
certain
pleasant
pointedness
.
``
Ah
no
,
you
're
not
!
You
're
not
in
the
*NL*
least
,
thank
goodness
!
If
you
had
been
we
should
n't
so
soon
have
found
*NL*
ourselves
here
together
.
I
think
,
''
she
comfortably
concluded
,
``
you
*NL*
trust
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
!
--
but
that
's
exactly
what
I
'm
afraid
of
.
I
should
n't
*NL*
mind
if
I
did
n't
.
It
's
falling
thus
in
twenty
minutes
so
utterly
into
*NL*
your
hands
.
I
dare
say
,
''
Strether
continued
,
``
it
's
a
sort
of
thing
*NL*
you
're
thoroughly
familiar
with
;
but
nothing
more
extraordinary
has
*NL*
ever
happened
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
him
with
all
her
kindness
.
``
That
means
simply
that
you
've
*NL*
recognised
me
--
which
IS
rather
beautiful
and
rare
.
You
see
what
I
am
.
''
*NL*
As
on
this
,
however
,
he
protested
,
with
a
good-humoured
headshake
,
a
*NL*
resignation
of
any
such
claim
,
she
had
a
moment
of
explanation
.
``
If
*NL*
you
'll
only
come
on
further
as
you
HAVE
come
you
'll
at
any
rate
make
*NL*
out
.
My
own
fate
has
been
too
many
for
me
,
and
I
've
succumbed
to
it
.
*NL*
I
'm
a
general
guide
--
to
`
Europe
,
'
do
n't
you
know
?
I
wait
for
people
--
I
*NL*
put
them
through
.
I
pick
them
up
--
I
set
them
down
.
I
'm
a
sort
of
*NL*
superior
`
courier-maid
.
'
I
'm
a
companion
at
large
.
I
take
people
,
as
*NL*
I
've
told
you
,
about
.
I
never
sought
it
--
it
has
come
to
me
.
It
has
*NL*
been
my
fate
,
and
one
's
fate
one
accepts
.
It
's
a
dreadful
thing
to
*NL*
have
to
say
,
in
so
wicked
a
world
,
but
I
verily
believe
that
,
such
as
*NL*
you
see
me
,
there
's
nothing
I
do
n't
know
.
I
know
all
the
shops
and
the
*NL*
prices
--
but
I
know
worse
things
still
.
I
bear
on
my
back
the
huge
load
*NL*
of
our
national
consciousness
,
or
,
in
other
words
--
for
it
comes
to
*NL*
that
--
of
our
nation
itself
.
Of
what
is
our
nation
composed
but
of
the
*NL*
men
and
women
individually
on
my
shoulders
?
I
do
n't
do
it
,
you
know
,
*NL*
for
any
particular
advantage
.
I
do
n't
do
it
,
for
instance
--
some
people
*NL*
do
,
you
know
--
for
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
could
only
listen
and
wonder
and
weigh
his
chance
.
``
And
yet
,
*NL*
affected
as
you
are
then
to
so
many
of
your
clients
,
you
can
scarcely
*NL*
be
said
to
do
it
for
love
.
''
He
waited
a
moment
.
``
How
do
we
reward
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
own
hesitation
,
but
``
You
do
n't
!
''
she
finally
returned
,
*NL*
setting
him
again
in
motion
.
They
went
on
,
but
in
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
though
while
still
thinking
over
what
she
had
said
,
he
once
more
took
*NL*
out
his
watch
;
mechanically
,
unconsciously
and
as
if
made
nervous
by
*NL*
the
mere
exhilaration
of
what
struck
him
as
her
strange
and
cynical
*NL*
wit
.
He
looked
at
the
hour
without
seeing
it
,
and
then
,
on
something
*NL*
again
said
by
his
companion
,
had
another
pause
.
``
You
're
really
in
*NL*
terror
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
a
smile
that
he
almost
felt
to
be
sickly
.
``
Now
you
can
see
*NL*
why
I
'm
afraid
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
've
such
illuminations
?
Why
they
're
all
for
your
help
!
It
's
*NL*
what
I
told
you
,
''
she
added
,
``
just
now
.
You
feel
as
if
this
were
*NL*
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
back
once
more
,
settling
himself
against
the
parapet
as
if
to
*NL*
hear
more
about
it
.
``
Then
get
me
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
fairly
brightened
for
the
joy
of
the
appeal
,
but
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
question
of
immediate
action
,
she
visibly
considered
.
``
Out
of
*NL*
waiting
for
him
?
--
of
seeing
him
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
not
that
,
''
said
poor
Strether
,
looking
grave
.
``
I
've
got
to
*NL*
wait
for
him
--
and
I
want
very
much
to
see
him
.
But
out
of
the
terror
.
*NL*
You
did
put
your
finger
on
it
a
few
minutes
ago
.
It
's
general
,
but
it
*NL*
avails
itself
of
particular
occasions
.
That
's
what
it
's
doing
for
me
*NL*
now
.
I
'm
always
considering
something
else
;
something
else
,
I
mean
,
*NL*
than
the
thing
of
the
moment
.
The
obsession
of
the
other
thing
is
the
*NL*
terror
.
I
'm
considering
at
present
for
instance
something
else
than
*NL*
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
with
charming
earnestness
.
``
Oh
you
ought
n't
to
do
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
I
admit
.
Make
it
then
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
to
think
.
``
Is
it
really
an
`
order
'
from
you
?
--
that
I
*NL*
shall
take
the
job
?
WILL
you
give
yourself
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Strether
heaved
his
sigh
.
``
If
I
only
could
!
But
that
's
the
deuce
*NL*
of
it
--
that
I
never
can
.
No
--
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
n't
,
however
,
discouraged
.
``
But
you
want
to
at
least
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
unspeakably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
if
you
'll
try
!
''
--
and
she
took
over
the
job
,
as
she
had
called
*NL*
it
,
on
the
spot
.
``
Trust
me
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
and
the
action
of
this
,
as
*NL*
they
retraced
their
steps
,
was
presently
to
make
him
pass
his
hand
into
*NL*
her
arm
in
the
manner
of
a
benign
dependent
paternal
old
person
who
*NL*
wishes
to
be
``
nice
''
to
a
younger
one
.
If
he
drew
it
out
again
indeed
*NL*
as
they
approached
the
inn
this
may
have
been
because
,
after
more
talk
*NL*
had
passed
between
them
,
the
relation
of
age
,
or
at
least
of
*NL*
experience
--
which
,
for
that
matter
,
had
already
played
to
and
fro
with
*NL*
some
freedom
--
affected
him
as
incurring
a
readjustment
.
It
was
at
all
*NL*
events
perhaps
lucky
that
they
arrived
in
sufficiently
separate
fashion
*NL*
within
range
of
the
hotel-door
.
The
young
lady
they
had
left
in
the
*NL*
glass
cage
watched
as
if
she
had
come
to
await
them
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
At
her
side
stood
a
person
equally
interested
,
by
his
attitude
,
in
*NL*
their
return
,
and
the
effect
of
the
sight
of
whom
was
instantly
to
*NL*
determine
for
Strether
another
of
those
responsive
arrests
that
we
have
*NL*
had
so
repeatedly
to
note
.
He
left
it
to
Miss
Gostrey
to
name
,
with
*NL*
the
fine
full
bravado
as
it
almost
struck
him
,
of
her
``
Mr.
Waymarsh
!
''
*NL*
what
was
to
have
been
,
what
--
he
more
than
ever
felt
as
his
short
stare
*NL*
of
suspended
welcome
took
things
in
--
would
have
been
,
but
for
herself
,
*NL*
his
doom
.
It
was
already
upon
him
even
at
that
distance
--
Mr.
Waymarsh
*NL*
was
for
HIS
part
joyless
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
none
the
less
to
confess
to
this
friend
that
evening
that
he
*NL*
knew
almost
nothing
about
her
,
and
it
was
a
deficiency
that
Waymarsh
,
*NL*
even
with
his
memory
refreshed
by
contact
,
by
her
own
prompt
and
lucid
*NL*
allusions
and
enquiries
,
by
their
having
publicly
partaken
of
dinner
in
*NL*
her
company
,
and
by
another
stroll
,
to
which
she
was
not
a
stranger
,
*NL*
out
into
the
town
to
look
at
the
cathedral
by
moonlight
--
it
was
a
blank
*NL*
that
the
resident
of
Milrose
,
though
admitting
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
Munsters
,
professed
himself
unable
to
fill
.
He
had
no
recollection
of
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
,
and
two
or
three
questions
that
she
put
to
him
about
*NL*
those
members
of
his
circle
had
,
to
Strether
's
observation
,
the
same
*NL*
effect
he
himself
had
already
more
directly
felt
--
the
effect
of
*NL*
appearing
to
place
all
knowledge
,
for
the
time
,
on
this
original
*NL*
woman
's
side
.
It
interested
him
indeed
to
mark
the
limits
of
any
such
*NL*
relation
for
her
with
his
friend
as
there
could
possibly
be
a
question
*NL*
of
,
and
it
particularly
struck
him
that
they
were
to
be
marked
*NL*
altogether
in
Waymarsh
's
quarter
.
This
added
to
his
own
sense
of
*NL*
having
gone
far
with
her-gave
him
an
early
illustration
of
a
much
*NL*
shorter
course
.
There
was
a
certitude
he
immediately
grasped
--
a
*NL*
conviction
that
Waymarsh
would
quite
fail
,
as
it
were
,
and
on
whatever
*NL*
degree
of
acquaintances
to
profit
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
after
the
first
interchange
among
the
three
a
talk
of
*NL*
some
five
minutes
in
the
hall
,
and
then
the
two
men
had
adjourned
to
*NL*
the
garden
,
Miss
Gostrey
for
the
time
disappearing
.
Strether
in
due
*NL*
course
accompanied
his
friend
to
the
room
he
had
bespoken
and
had
,
*NL*
before
going
out
,
scrupulously
visited
;
where
at
the
end
of
another
*NL*
half-hour
he
had
no
less
discreetly
left
him
.
On
leaving
him
he
*NL*
repaired
straight
to
his
own
room
,
but
with
the
prompt
effect
of
*NL*
feeling
the
compass
of
that
chamber
resented
by
his
condition
.
There
*NL*
he
enjoyed
at
once
the
first
consequence
of
their
reunion
.
A
place
was
*NL*
too
small
for
him
after
it
that
had
seemed
large
enough
before
.
He
had
*NL*
awaited
it
with
something
he
would
have
been
sorry
,
have
been
almost
*NL*
ashamed
not
to
recognise
as
emotion
,
yet
with
a
tacit
assumption
at
the
*NL*
same
time
that
emotion
would
in
the
event
find
itself
relieved
.
The
*NL*
actual
oddity
was
that
he
was
only
more
excited
;
and
his
excitement-to
*NL*
which
indeed
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
instantly
to
give
a
*NL*
name
--
brought
him
once
more
downstairs
and
caused
him
for
some
minutes
*NL*
vaguely
to
wander
.
He
went
once
more
to
the
garden
;
he
looked
into
the
*NL*
public
room
,
found
Miss
Gostrey
writing
letters
and
backed
out
;
he
*NL*
roamed
,
fidgeted
and
wasted
time
;
but
he
was
to
have
his
more
intimate
*NL*
session
with
his
friend
before
the
evening
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
--
not
till
Strether
had
spent
an
hour
upstairs
with
*NL*
him
--
that
this
subject
consented
to
betake
himself
to
doubtful
rest
.
*NL*
Dinner
and
the
subsequent
stroll
by
moonlight
--
a
dream
,
on
Strether
's
*NL*
part
,
of
romantic
effects
rather
prosaically
merged
in
a
mere
missing
*NL*
of
thicker
coats
--
had
measurably
intervened
,
and
this
midnight
*NL*
conference
was
the
result
of
Waymarsh
's
having
-LRB-
when
they
were
free
,
as
*NL*
he
put
it
,
of
their
fashionable
friend
-RRB-
found
the
smoking-room
not
*NL*
quite
what
he
wanted
,
and
yet
bed
what
he
wanted
less
.
His
most
*NL*
frequent
form
of
words
was
that
he
knew
himself
,
and
they
were
applied
*NL*
on
this
occasion
to
his
certainty
of
not
sleeping
.
He
knew
himself
*NL*
well
enough
to
know
that
he
should
have
a
night
of
prowling
unless
he
*NL*
should
succeed
,
as
a
preliminary
,
in
getting
prodigiously
tired
.
If
*NL*
the
effort
directed
to
this
end
involved
till
a
late
hour
the
presence
*NL*
of
Strether
--
consisted
,
that
is
,
in
the
detention
of
the
latter
for
*NL*
full
discourse
--
there
was
yet
an
impression
of
minor
discipline
*NL*
involved
for
our
friend
in
the
picture
Waymarsh
made
as
he
sat
in
*NL*
trousers
and
shirt
on
the
edge
of
his
couch
.
With
his
long
legs
*NL*
extended
and
his
large
back
much
bent
,
he
nursed
alternately
,
for
an
*NL*
almost
incredible
time
,
his
elbows
and
his
beard
.
He
struck
his
*NL*
visitor
as
extremely
,
as
almost
wilfully
uncomfortable
;
yet
what
had
*NL*
this
been
for
Strether
,
from
that
first
glimpse
of
him
disconcerted
in
*NL*
the
porch
of
the
hotel
,
but
the
predominant
notes
.
The
discomfort
was
*NL*
in
a
manner
contagious
,
as
well
as
also
in
a
manner
inconsequent
and
*NL*
unfounded
;
the
visitor
felt
that
unless
he
should
get
used
to
it
--
or
*NL*
unless
Waymarsh
himself
should
--
it
would
constitute
a
menace
for
his
*NL*
own
prepared
,
his
own
already
confirmed
,
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
agreeable
.
On
their
first
going
up
together
to
the
room
Strether
had
*NL*
selected
for
him
Waymarsh
had
looked
it
over
in
silence
and
with
a
sigh
*NL*
that
represented
for
his
companion
,
if
not
the
habit
of
disapprobation
,
*NL*
at
least
the
despair
of
felicity
;
and
this
look
had
recurred
to
*NL*
Strether
as
the
key
of
much
he
had
since
observed
.
``
Europe
,
''
he
had
*NL*
begun
to
gather
from
these
things
,
had
up
to
now
rather
failed
of
its
*NL*
message
to
him
;
he
had
n't
got
into
tune
with
it
and
had
at
the
end
of
*NL*
three
months
almost
renounced
any
such
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
appeared
at
present
to
insist
on
that
by
just
perching
there
*NL*
with
the
gas
in
his
eyes
.
This
of
itself
somehow
conveyed
the
futility
*NL*
of
single
rectifications
in
a
multiform
failure
.
He
had
a
large
*NL*
handsome
head
and
a
large
sallow
seamed
face
--
a
striking
significant
*NL*
physiognomic
total
,
the
upper
range
of
which
,
the
great
political
brow
,
*NL*
the
thick
loose
hair
,
the
dark
fuliginous
eyes
,
recalled
even
to
a
*NL*
generation
whose
standard
had
dreadfully
deviated
the
impressive
image
,
*NL*
familiar
by
engravings
and
busts
,
of
some
great
national
worthy
of
the
*NL*
earlier
part
of
the
mid-century
.
He
was
of
the
personal
type
--
and
it
*NL*
was
an
element
in
the
power
and
promise
that
in
their
early
time
*NL*
Strether
had
found
in
him
--
of
the
American
statesman
,
the
statesman
*NL*
trained
in
``
Congressional
halls
,
''
of
an
elder
day
.
The
legend
had
been
*NL*
in
later
years
that
as
the
lower
part
of
his
face
,
which
was
weak
,
and
*NL*
slightly
crooked
,
spoiled
the
likeness
,
this
was
the
real
reason
for
*NL*
the
growth
of
his
beard
,
which
might
have
seemed
to
spoil
it
for
those
*NL*
not
in
the
secret
.
He
shook
his
mane
;
he
fixed
,
with
his
admirable
*NL*
eyes
,
his
auditor
or
his
observer
;
he
wore
no
glasses
and
had
a
way
,
*NL*
partly
formidable
,
yet
also
partly
encouraging
,
as
from
a
*NL*
representative
to
a
constituent
,
of
looking
very
hard
at
those
who
*NL*
approached
him
.
He
met
you
as
if
you
had
knocked
and
he
had
bidden
you
*NL*
enter
.
Strether
,
who
had
n't
seen
him
for
so
long
an
interval
,
*NL*
apprehended
him
now
with
a
freshness
of
taste
,
and
had
perhaps
never
*NL*
done
him
such
ideal
justice
.
The
head
was
bigger
,
the
eyes
finer
,
than
*NL*
they
need
have
been
for
the
career
;
but
that
only
meant
,
after
all
,
*NL*
that
the
career
was
itself
expressive
.
What
it
expressed
at
midnight
*NL*
in
the
gas-glaring
bedroom
at
Chester
was
that
the
subject
of
it
had
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
years
,
barely
escaped
,
by
flight
in
time
,
a
general
*NL*
nervous
collapse
.
But
this
very
proof
of
the
full
life
,
as
the
full
*NL*
life
was
understood
at
Milrose
,
would
have
made
to
Strether
's
*NL*
imagination
an
element
in
which
Waymarsh
could
have
floated
easily
had
*NL*
he
only
consented
to
float
.
Alas
nothing
so
little
resembled
floating
*NL*
as
the
rigour
with
which
,
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
,
he
hugged
his
posture
*NL*
of
prolonged
impermanence
.
It
suggested
to
his
comrade
something
that
*NL*
always
,
when
kept
up
,
worried
him
--
a
person
established
in
a
*NL*
railway-coach
with
a
forward
inclination
.
It
represented
the
angle
at
*NL*
which
poor
Waymarsh
was
to
sit
through
the
ordeal
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
stress
of
occupation
,
the
strain
of
professions
,
the
*NL*
absorption
and
embarrassment
of
each
,
they
had
not
,
at
home
,
during
*NL*
years
before
this
sudden
brief
and
almost
bewildering
reign
of
*NL*
comparative
ease
,
found
so
much
as
a
day
for
a
meeting
;
a
fact
that
was
*NL*
in
some
degree
an
explanation
of
the
sharpness
with
which
most
of
his
*NL*
friend
's
features
stood
out
to
Strether
.
Those
he
had
lost
sight
of
*NL*
since
the
early
time
came
back
to
him
;
others
that
it
was
never
*NL*
possible
to
forget
struck
him
now
as
sitting
,
clustered
and
expectant
,
*NL*
like
a
somewhat
defiant
family-group
,
on
the
doorstep
of
their
*NL*
residence
.
The
room
was
narrow
for
its
length
,
and
the
occupant
of
the
*NL*
bed
thrust
so
far
a
pair
of
slippered
feet
that
the
visitor
had
almost
*NL*
to
step
over
them
in
his
recurrent
rebounds
from
his
chair
to
fidget
*NL*
back
and
forth
.
There
were
marks
the
friends
made
on
things
to
talk
*NL*
about
,
and
on
things
not
to
,
and
one
of
the
latter
in
particular
fell
*NL*
like
the
tap
of
chalk
on
the
blackboard
.
Married
at
thirty
,
Waymarsh
*NL*
had
not
lived
with
his
wife
for
fifteen
years
,
and
it
came
up
vividly
*NL*
between
them
in
the
glare
of
the
gas
that
Strether
was
n't
to
ask
about
*NL*
her
.
He
knew
they
were
still
separate
and
that
she
lived
at
hotels
,
*NL*
travelled
in
Europe
,
painted
her
face
and
wrote
her
husband
abusive
*NL*
letters
,
of
not
one
of
which
,
to
a
certainty
,
that
sufferer
spared
*NL*
himself
the
perusal
;
but
he
respected
without
difficulty
the
cold
*NL*
twilight
that
had
settled
on
this
side
of
his
companion
's
life
.
It
was
*NL*
a
province
in
which
mystery
reigned
and
as
to
which
Waymarsh
had
never
*NL*
spoken
the
informing
word
.
Strether
,
who
wanted
to
do
him
the
highest
*NL*
justice
wherever
he
COULD
do
it
,
singularly
admired
him
for
the
dignity
*NL*
of
this
reserve
,
and
even
counted
it
as
one
of
the
grounds
--
grounds
all
*NL*
handled
and
numbered
--
for
ranking
him
,
in
the
range
of
their
*NL*
acquaintance
,
as
a
success
.
He
WAS
a
success
,
Waymarsh
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
overwork
,
or
prostration
,
of
sensible
shrinkage
,
of
his
wife
's
letters
*NL*
and
of
his
not
liking
Europe
.
Strether
would
have
reckoned
his
own
*NL*
career
less
futile
had
he
been
able
to
put
into
it
anything
so
handsome
*NL*
as
so
much
fine
silence
.
One
might
one
's
self
easily
have
left
Mrs.
*NL*
Waymarsh
;
and
one
would
assuredly
have
paid
one
's
tribute
to
the
ideal
*NL*
in
covering
with
that
attitude
the
derision
of
having
been
left
by
her
.
*NL*
Her
husband
had
held
his
tongue
and
had
made
a
large
income
;
and
these
*NL*
were
in
especial
the
achievements
as
to
which
Strether
envied
him
.
Our
*NL*
friend
had
had
indeed
on
his
side
too
a
subject
for
silence
,
which
he
*NL*
fully
appreciated
;
but
it
was
a
matter
of
a
different
sort
,
and
the
*NL*
figure
of
the
income
he
had
arrived
at
had
never
been
high
enough
to
*NL*
look
any
one
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
as
I
quite
see
what
you
require
it
for
.
You
do
n't
appear
*NL*
sick
to
speak
of
.
''
It
was
of
Europe
Waymarsh
thus
finally
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
who
fell
as
much
as
possible
into
step
,
``
I
guess
*NL*
I
do
n't
FEEL
sick
now
that
I
've
started
.
But
I
had
pretty
well
run
*NL*
down
before
I
did
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
raised
his
melancholy
look
.
``
Ai
n't
you
about
up
to
your
usual
*NL*
average
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
quite
pointedly
sceptical
,
but
it
seemed
somehow
a
plea
for
*NL*
the
purest
veracity
,
and
it
thereby
affected
our
friend
as
the
very
*NL*
voice
of
Milrose
.
He
had
long
since
made
a
mental
distinction
--
though
*NL*
never
in
truth
daring
to
betray
it
--
between
the
voice
of
Milrose
and
*NL*
the
voice
even
of
Woollett
.
It
was
the
former
he
felt
,
that
was
most
*NL*
in
the
real
tradition
.
There
had
been
occasions
in
his
past
when
the
*NL*
sound
of
it
had
reduced
him
to
temporary
confusion
,
and
the
present
,
*NL*
for
some
reason
,
suddenly
became
such
another
.
It
was
nevertheless
no
*NL*
light
matter
that
the
very
effect
of
his
confusion
should
be
to
make
*NL*
him
again
prevaricate
.
``
That
description
hardly
does
justice
to
a
man
*NL*
to
whom
it
has
done
such
a
lot
of
good
to
see
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
fixed
on
his
washing-stand
the
silent
detached
stare
with
*NL*
which
Milrose
in
person
,
as
it
were
,
might
have
marked
the
*NL*
unexpectedness
of
a
compliment
from
Woollett
,
and
Strether
for
his
*NL*
part
,
felt
once
more
like
Woollett
in
person
.
``
I
mean
,
''
his
friend
*NL*
presently
continued
,
``
that
your
appearance
is
n't
as
bad
as
I
've
seen
*NL*
it
:
it
compares
favourably
with
what
it
was
when
I
last
noticed
it
.
''
*NL*
On
this
appearance
Waymarsh
's
eyes
yet
failed
to
rest
;
it
was
almost
as
*NL*
if
they
obeyed
an
instinct
of
propriety
,
and
the
effect
was
still
*NL*
stronger
when
,
always
considering
the
basin
and
jug
,
he
added
:
``
You
've
*NL*
filled
out
some
since
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
have
,
''
Strether
laughed
:
``
one
does
fill
out
some
with
*NL*
all
one
takes
in
,
and
I
've
taken
in
,
I
dare
say
,
more
than
I
've
natural
*NL*
room
for
.
I
was
dog-tired
when
I
sailed
.
''
It
had
the
oddest
sound
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
dog-tired
,
''
his
companion
returned
,
``
when
I
arrived
,
and
it
's
*NL*
this
wild
hunt
for
rest
that
takes
all
the
life
out
of
me
.
The
fact
*NL*
is
,
Strether
--
and
it
's
a
comfort
to
have
you
here
at
last
to
say
it
to
;
*NL*
though
I
do
n't
know
,
after
all
,
that
I
've
really
waited
;
I
've
told
it
*NL*
to
people
I
've
met
in
the
cars
--
the
fact
is
,
such
a
country
as
this
*NL*
ai
n't
my
KIND
of
country
anyway
.
There
ai
n't
a
country
I
've
seen
over
*NL*
here
that
DOES
seem
my
kind
.
Oh
I
do
n't
say
but
what
there
are
plenty
*NL*
of
pretty
places
and
remarkable
old
things
;
but
the
trouble
is
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
seem
to
feel
anywhere
in
tune
.
That
's
one
of
the
reasons
why
I
*NL*
suppose
I
've
gained
so
little
.
I
have
n't
had
the
first
sign
of
that
*NL*
lift
I
was
led
to
expect
.
''
With
this
he
broke
out
more
earnestly
.
*NL*
``
Look
here
--
I
want
to
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
all
attached
to
Strether
's
now
,
for
he
was
one
of
the
men
*NL*
who
fully
face
you
when
they
talk
of
themselves
.
This
enabled
his
*NL*
friend
to
look
at
him
hard
and
immediately
to
appear
to
the
highest
*NL*
advantage
in
his
eyes
by
doing
so
.
``
That
's
a
genial
thing
to
say
to
a
*NL*
fellow
who
has
come
out
on
purpose
to
meet
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
have
been
finer
,
on
this
,
than
Waymarsh
's
sombre
glow
.
*NL*
``
HAVE
you
come
out
on
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
very
largely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
from
the
way
you
wrote
there
was
something
back
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
Back
of
my
desire
to
be
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
of
your
prostration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
with
a
smile
made
more
dim
by
a
certain
consciousness
,
shook
*NL*
his
head
.
``
There
are
all
the
causes
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
no
particular
cause
that
seemed
most
to
drive
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
could
at
last
conscientiously
answer
.
``
Yes
.
One
.
There
IS
*NL*
a
matter
that
has
had
much
to
do
with
my
coming
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
waited
a
little
.
``
Too
private
to
mention
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
too
private
--
for
YOU
.
Only
rather
complicated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Waymarsh
,
who
had
waited
again
,
``
I
MAY
lose
my
mind
over
*NL*
here
,
but
I
do
n't
know
as
I
've
done
so
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
shall
have
the
whole
thing
.
But
not
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
seemed
to
sit
stiffer
and
to
hold
his
elbows
tighter
.
``
Why
*NL*
not
--
if
I
ca
n't
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
my
dear
man
,
I
CAN
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
where
's
your
prostration
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
in
that
--
that
I
can
put
in
eight
hours
.
''
And
Strether
brought
it
*NL*
out
that
if
Waymarsh
did
n't
``
gain
''
it
was
because
he
did
n't
go
to
bed
:
*NL*
the
result
of
which
was
,
in
its
order
,
that
,
to
do
the
latter
justice
,
*NL*
he
permitted
his
friend
to
insist
on
his
really
getting
settled
.
*NL*
Strether
,
with
a
kind
coercive
hand
for
it
,
assisted
him
to
this
*NL*
consummation
,
and
again
found
his
own
part
in
their
relation
*NL*
auspiciously
enlarged
by
the
smaller
touches
of
lowering
the
lamp
and
*NL*
seeing
to
a
sufficiency
of
blanket
.
It
somehow
ministered
for
him
to
*NL*
indulgence
to
feel
Waymarsh
,
who
looked
unnaturally
big
and
black
in
*NL*
bed
,
as
much
tucked
in
as
a
patient
in
a
hospital
and
,
with
his
*NL*
covering
up
to
his
chin
,
as
much
simplified
by
it
He
hovered
in
vague
*NL*
pity
,
to
be
brief
,
while
his
companion
challenged
him
out
of
the
*NL*
bedclothes
.
``
Is
she
really
after
you
?
Is
that
what
's
behind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
felt
an
uneasiness
at
the
direction
taken
by
his
companion
's
*NL*
insight
,
but
he
played
a
little
at
uncertainty
.
``
Behind
my
coming
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
your
prostration
or
whatever
.
It
's
generally
felt
,
you
know
,
*NL*
that
she
follows
you
up
pretty
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
candour
was
never
very
far
off
.
``
Oh
it
has
occurred
to
you
*NL*
that
I
'm
literally
running
away
from
Mrs.
Newsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
n't
KNOWN
but
what
you
are
.
You
're
a
very
attractive
man
,
*NL*
Strether
.
You
've
seen
for
yourself
,
''
said
Waymarsh
``
what
that
lady
*NL*
downstairs
makes
of
it
.
Unless
indeed
,
''
he
rambled
on
with
an
effect
*NL*
between
the
ironic
and
the
anxious
,
``
it
's
you
who
are
after
HER
.
IS
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
OVER
here
?
''
He
spoke
as
with
a
droll
dread
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
his
friend
--
though
rather
dimly
--
smile
.
``
Dear
no
she
's
safe
,
*NL*
thank
goodness
--
as
I
think
I
more
and
more
feel
--
at
home
.
She
thought
*NL*
of
coming
,
but
she
gave
it
up
.
I
've
come
in
a
manner
instead
of
her
;
*NL*
and
come
to
that
extent
--
for
you
're
right
in
your
inference
--
on
her
*NL*
business
.
So
you
see
there
IS
plenty
of
connexion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
continued
to
see
at
least
all
there
was
.
``
Involving
*NL*
accordingly
the
particular
one
I
've
referred
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
another
turn
about
the
room
,
giving
a
twitch
to
his
*NL*
companion
's
blanket
and
finally
gaining
the
door
.
His
feeling
was
that
*NL*
of
a
nurse
who
had
earned
personal
rest
by
having
made
everything
*NL*
straight
.
``
Involving
more
things
than
I
can
think
of
breaking
ground
*NL*
on
now
.
But
do
n't
be
afraid
--
you
shall
have
them
from
me
:
you
'll
*NL*
probably
find
yourself
having
quite
as
much
of
them
as
you
can
do
with
.
*NL*
I
shall
--
if
we
keep
together
--
very
much
depend
on
your
impression
of
*NL*
some
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
acknowledgement
of
this
tribute
was
characteristically
*NL*
indirect
.
``
You
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
believe
we
WILL
keep
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
glance
at
the
danger
,
''
Strether
paternally
said
,
``
because
when
*NL*
I
hear
you
wail
to
go
back
I
seem
to
see
you
open
up
such
possibilities
*NL*
of
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
took
it
--
silent
a
little
--
like
a
large
snubbed
child
``
What
are
*NL*
you
going
to
do
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
very
question
Strether
himself
had
put
to
Miss
Gostrey
,
and
*NL*
he
wondered
if
he
had
sounded
like
that
.
But
HE
at
least
could
be
more
*NL*
definite
.
``
I
'm
going
to
take
you
right
down
to
London
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
've
been
down
to
London
!
''
Waymarsh
more
softly
moaned
.
``
I
've
no
*NL*
use
,
Strether
,
for
anything
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
good-humouredly
,
``
I
guess
you
've
some
use
for
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
've
got
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
've
got
to
go
further
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Waymarsh
sighed
,
``
do
your
damnedest
!
Only
you
WILL
tell
me
*NL*
before
you
lead
me
on
all
the
way
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
had
again
so
lost
himself
,
both
for
amusement
and
for
*NL*
contrition
,
in
the
wonder
of
whether
he
had
made
,
in
his
own
challenge
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
such
another
figure
,
that
he
for
an
instant
missed
the
*NL*
thread
.
``
Tell
you
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
what
you
've
got
on
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
Why
it
's
such
a
matter
as
that
even
if
I
*NL*
positively
wanted
I
should
n't
be
able
to
keep
it
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
gloomily
gazed
.
``
What
does
that
mean
then
but
that
your
trip
*NL*
is
just
FOR
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Mrs.
Newsome
?
Oh
it
certainly
is
,
as
I
say
.
Very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
also
say
it
's
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
in
impatience
,
violently
played
with
his
latch
.
``
It
's
simple
*NL*
enough
.
It
's
for
both
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
at
last
turned
over
with
a
groan
.
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
marry
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
,
when
it
comes
to
that
--
!
''
But
the
visitor
had
already
laughed
*NL*
and
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
told
Miss
Gostrey
he
should
probably
take
,
for
departure
with
*NL*
Waymarsh
,
some
afternoon
train
,
and
it
thereupon
in
the
morning
*NL*
appeared
that
this
lady
had
made
her
own
plan
for
an
earlier
one
.
She
*NL*
had
breakfasted
when
Strether
came
into
the
coffee-room
;
but
,
Waymarsh
*NL*
not
having
yet
emerged
,
he
was
in
time
to
recall
her
to
the
terms
of
*NL*
their
understanding
and
to
pronounce
her
discretion
overdone
.
She
was
*NL*
surely
not
to
break
away
at
the
very
moment
she
had
created
a
want
.
He
*NL*
had
met
her
as
she
rose
from
her
little
table
in
a
window
,
where
,
with
*NL*
the
morning
papers
beside
her
,
she
reminded
him
,
as
he
let
her
know
,
of
*NL*
Major
Pendennis
breakfasting
at
his
club
--
a
compliment
of
which
she
*NL*
professed
a
deep
appreciation
;
and
he
detained
her
as
pleadingly
as
if
*NL*
he
had
already
--
and
notably
under
pressure
of
the
visions
of
the
*NL*
night
--
learned
to
be
unable
to
do
without
her
.
She
must
teach
him
at
*NL*
all
events
,
before
she
went
,
to
order
breakfast
as
breakfast
was
*NL*
ordered
in
Europe
,
and
she
must
especially
sustain
him
in
the
problem
*NL*
of
ordering
for
Waymarsh
.
The
latter
had
laid
upon
his
friend
,
by
*NL*
desperate
sounds
through
the
door
of
his
room
,
dreadful
divined
*NL*
responsibilities
in
respect
to
beefsteak
and
oranges
--
responsibilities
*NL*
which
Miss
Gostrey
took
over
with
an
alertness
of
action
that
matched
*NL*
her
quick
intelligence
.
She
had
before
this
weaned
the
expatriated
*NL*
from
traditions
compared
with
which
the
matutinal
beefsteak
was
but
the
*NL*
creature
of
an
hour
,
and
it
was
not
for
her
,
with
some
of
her
memories
,
*NL*
to
falter
in
the
path
though
she
freely
enough
declared
,
on
reflexion
,
*NL*
that
there
was
always
in
such
cases
a
choice
of
opposed
policies
.
*NL*
``
There
are
times
when
to
give
them
their
head
,
you
know
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gone
to
wait
together
in
the
garden
for
the
dressing
of
the
*NL*
meal
,
and
Strether
found
her
more
suggestive
than
ever
``
Well
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
to
bring
about
for
them
such
a
complexity
of
relations-unless
*NL*
indeed
we
call
it
a
simplicity
!
--
that
the
situation
HAS
to
wind
itself
*NL*
up
.
They
want
to
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
want
them
to
go
!
''
Strether
gaily
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
want
them
to
go
,
and
I
send
them
as
fast
as
I
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
know
--
you
take
them
to
Liverpool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
port
will
serve
in
a
storm
.
I
'm
--
with
all
my
other
functions
--
an
*NL*
agent
for
repatriation

I
want
to
re-people
our
stricken

*NL*
The
ordered
English
garden
,
in
the
freshness
of
the
day
,
was
*NL*
delightful
to
Strether
,
who
liked
the
sound
,
under
his
feet
,
of
the
*NL*
tight
fine
gravel
,
packed
with
the
chronic
damp
,
and
who
had
the
idlest
*NL*
eye
for
the
deep
smoothness
of
turf
and
the
clean
curves
of
paths
.
*NL*
``
Other
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other

Other
people
--
yes
.
I
want
to
encourage
our
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
``
Not
to
come
?
Why
then
do
you
`
meet
'
them
--
since
*NL*
it
does
n't
appear
to
be
to
stop
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
they
should
n't
come
is
as
yet
too
much
to
ask
.
What
I
attend
*NL*
to
is
that
they
come
quickly
and
return
still
more
so
.
I
meet
them
to
*NL*
help
it
to
be
over
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
though
I
do
n't
stop
them
*NL*
I
've
my
way
of
putting
them
through
.
That
's
my
little
system
;
and
,
if
*NL*
you
want
to
know
,
''
said
Maria
Gostrey
,
``
it
's
my
real
secret
,
my
*NL*
innermost
mission
and
use
.
I
only
seem
,
you
see
,
to
beguile
and
*NL*
approve
;
but
I
've
thought
it
all
out
and
I
'm
working
all
the
while
*NL*
underground
.
I
ca
n't
perhaps
quite
give
you
my
formula
,
but
I
think
*NL*
that
practically
I
succeed
.
I
send
you
back
spent

So
you
stay
back

*NL*
Passed
through
my
hands
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
turn
up
again
?
''
The
further
she
went
the
further
he
always
*NL*
saw
himself
able
to
follow
.
``
I
do
n't
want
your
formula
--
I
feel
quite
*NL*
enough
,
as
I
hinted
yesterday
,
your
abysses

''
he
echoed
.
``
If
*NL*
that
's
how
you
're
arranging
so
subtly
to
send
me
I
thank
you
for
the
*NL*
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
,
amid
the
pleasantness
--
poetry
in
tariffed
items
,
but
all
*NL*
the
more
,
for
guests
already
convicted
,
a
challenge
to
consumption
--
they
*NL*
smiled
at
each
other
in
confirmed
fellowship
.
``
Do
you
call
it
subtly
?
*NL*
It
's
a
plain
poor
tale

Besides
,
you
're
a
special
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
special
cases
--
that
's
weak
!
''
She
was
weak
enough
,
further
still
,
to
*NL*
defer
her
journey
and
agree
to
accompany
the
gentlemen
on
their
own
,
*NL*
might
a
separate
carriage
mark
her
independence
;
though
it
was
in
spite
*NL*
of
this
to
befall
after
luncheon
that
she
went
off
alone
and
that
,
with
*NL*
a
tryst
taken
for
a
day
of
her
company
in
London
,
they
lingered
another
*NL*
night
.
She
had
,
during
the
morning
--
spent
in
a
way
that
he
was
to
*NL*
remember
later
on
as
the
very
climax
of
his
foretaste
,
as
warm
with
*NL*
presentiments
,
with
what
he
would
have
called
collapses
--
had
all
sorts
*NL*
of
things
out
with
Strether
;
and
among
them
the
fact
that
though
there
*NL*
was
never
a
moment
of
her
life
when
she
was
n't
``
due
''
somewhere
,
there
*NL*
was
yet
scarce
a
perfidy
to
others
of
which
she
was
n't
capable
for
his
*NL*
sake
.
She
explained
moreover
that
wherever
she
happened
to
be
she
*NL*
found
a
dropped
thread
to
pick
up
,
a
ragged
edge
to
repair
,
some
*NL*
familiar
appetite
in
ambush
,
jumping
out
as
she
approached
,
yet
*NL*
appeasable
with
a
temporary
biscuit
.
It
became
,
on
her
taking
the
risk
*NL*
of
the
deviation
imposed
on
him
by
her
insidious
arrangement
of
his
*NL*
morning
meal
,
a
point
of
honour
for
her
not
to
fail
with
Waymarsh
of
*NL*
the
larger
success
too
;
and
her
subsequent
boast
to
Strether
was
that
*NL*
she
had
made
their
friend
fare
--
and
quite
without
his
knowing
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
--
as
Major
Pendennis
would
have
fared
at
the
Megatherium
.
She
*NL*
had
made
him
breakfast
like
a
gentleman
,
and
it
was
nothing
,
she
*NL*
forcibly
asserted
,
to
what
she
would
yet
make
him
do
.
She
made
him
*NL*
participate
in
the
slow
reiterated
ramble
with
which
,
for
Strether
,
the
*NL*
new
day
amply
filled
itself
;
and
it
was
by
her
art
that
he
somehow
had
*NL*
the
air
,
on
the
ramparts
and
in
the
Rows
,
of
carrying
a
point
of
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
strolled
and
stared
and
gossiped
,
or
at
least
the
two
did
;
*NL*
the
case
really
yielding
for
their
comrade
,
if
analysed
,
but
the
*NL*
element
of
stricken
silence
.
This
element
indeed
affected
Strether
as
*NL*
charged
with
audible
rumblings
,
but
he
was
conscious
of
the
care
of
*NL*
taking
it
explicitly
as
a
sign
of
pleasant
peace
.
He
would
n't
appeal
*NL*
too
much
,
for
that
provoked
stiffness
;
yet
he
would
n't
be
too
freely
*NL*
tacit
,
for
that
suggested
giving
up
.
Waymarsh
himself
adhered
to
an
*NL*
ambiguous
dumbness
that
might
have
represented
either
the
growth
of
a
*NL*
perception
or
the
despair
of
one
;
and
at
times
and
in
places
--
where
the
*NL*
low-browed
galleries
were
darkest
,
the
opposite
gables
queerest
,
the
*NL*
solicitations
of
every
kind
densest
--
the
others
caught
him
fixing
hard
*NL*
some
object
of
minor
interest
,
fixing
even
at
moments
nothing
*NL*
discernible
,
as
if
he
were
indulging
it
with
a
truce
.
When
he
met
*NL*
Strether
's
eye
on
such
occasions
he
looked
guilty
and
furtive
,
fell
the
*NL*
next
minute
into
some
attitude
of
retractation
.
Our
friend
could
n't
*NL*
show
him
the
right
things
for
fear
of
provoking
some
total
*NL*
renouncement
,
and
was
tempted
even
to
show
him
the
wrong
in
order
to
*NL*
make
him
differ
with
triumph
.
There
were
moments
when
he
himself
felt
*NL*
shy
of
professing
the
full
sweetness
of
the
taste
of
leisure
,
and
there
*NL*
were
others
when
he
found
himself
feeling
as
if
his
passages
of
*NL*
interchange
with
the
lady
at
his
side
might
fall
upon
the
third
member
*NL*
of
their
party
very
much
as
Mr.
Burchell
,
at
Dr.
Primrose
's
fireside
,
*NL*
was
influenced
by
the
high
flights
of
the
visitors
from
London
.
The
*NL*
smallest
things
so
arrested
and
amused
him
that
he
repeatedly
almost
*NL*
apologised
--
brought
up
afresh
in
explanation
his
plea
of
a
previous
*NL*
grind
.
He
was
aware
at
the
same
time
that
his
grind
had
been
as
*NL*
nothing
to
Waymarsh
's
,
and
he
repeatedly
confessed
that
,
to
cover
his
*NL*
frivolity
,
he
was
doing
his
best
for
his
previous
virtue
.
Do
what
he
*NL*
might
,
in
any
case
,
his
previous
virtue
was
still
there
,
and
it
seemed
*NL*
fairly
to
stare
at
him
out
of
the
windows
of
shops
that
were
not
as
the
*NL*
shops
of
Woollett
,
fairly
to
make
him
want
things
that
he
should
n't
*NL*
know
what
to
do
with
.
It
was
by
the
oddest
,
the
least
admissible
of
*NL*
laws
demoralising
him
now
;
and
the
way
it
boldly
took
was
to
make
him
*NL*
want
more
wants
.
These
first
walks
in
Europe
were
in
fact
a
kind
of
*NL*
finely
lurid
intimation
of
what
one
might
find
at
the
end
of
that
*NL*
process
.
Had
he
come
back
after
long
years
,
in
something
already
so
*NL*
like
the
evening
of
life
,
only
to
be
exposed
to
it
?
It
was
at
all
*NL*
events
over
the
shop-windows
that
he
made
,
with
Waymarsh
,
most
free
;
*NL*
though
it
would
have
been
easier
had
not
the
latter
most
sensibly
*NL*
yielded
to
the
appeal
of
the
merely
useful
trades
.
He
pierced
with
his
*NL*
sombre
detachment
the
plate-glass
of
ironmongers
and
saddlers
,
while
*NL*
Strether
flaunted
an
affinity
with
the
dealers
in
stamped
letter-paper
*NL*
and
in
smart
neckties
.
Strether
was
in
fact
recurrently
shameless
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
the
tailors
,
though
it
was
just
over
the
heads
of
the
*NL*
tailors
that
his
countryman
most
loftily
looked
.
This
gave
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
a
grasped
opportunity
to
back
up
Waymarsh
at
his
expense
.
The
*NL*
weary
lawyer
--
it
was
unmistakeable
--
had
a
conception
of
dress
;
but
*NL*
that
,
in
view
of
some
of
the
features
of
the
effect
produced
,
was
just
*NL*
what
made
the
danger
of
insistence
on
it
.
Strether
wondered
if
he
by
*NL*
this
time
thought
Miss
Gostrey
less
fashionable
or
Lambert
Strether
*NL*
more
so
;
and
it
appeared
probable
that
most
of
the
remarks
exchanged
*NL*
between
this
latter
pair
about
passers
,
figures
,
faces
,
personal
types
,
*NL*
exemplified
in
their
degree
the
disposition
to
talk
as
``
society
''
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
what
was
happening
to
himself
then
,
was
what
already
HAD
happened
,
*NL*
really
that
a
woman
of
fashion
was
floating
him
into
society
and
that
*NL*
an
old
friend
deserted
on
the
brink
was
watching
the
force
of
the
*NL*
current
?
When
the
woman
of
fashion
permitted
Strether
--
as
she
*NL*
permitted
him
at
the
most
--
the
purchase
of
a
pair
of
gloves
,
the
terms
*NL*
she
made
about
it
,
the
prohibition
of
neckties
and
other
items
till
she
*NL*
should
be
able
to
guide
him
through
the
Burlington
Arcade
,
were
such
as
*NL*
to
fall
upon
a
sensitive
ear
as
a
challenge
to
just
imputations
.
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
was
such
a
woman
of
fashion
as
could
make
without
a
symptom
of
*NL*
vulgar
blinking
an
appointment
for
the
Burlington
Arcade
.
Mere
*NL*
discriminations
about
a
pair
of
gloves
could
thus
at
any
rate
*NL*
represent
--
always
for
such
sensitive
ears
as
were
in
*NL*
question
--
possibilities
of
something
that
Strether
could
make
a
mark
*NL*
against
only
as
the
peril
of
apparent
wantonness
.
He
had
quite
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
new
friend
,
for
their
companion
,
that
he
might
*NL*
have
had
of
a
Jesuit
in
petticoats
,
a
representative
of
the
recruiting
*NL*
interests
of
the
Catholic
Church
.
The
Catholic
Church
,
for
*NL*
Waymarsh-that
was
to
say
the
enemy
,
the
monster
of
bulging
eyes
and
*NL*
far-reaching
quivering
groping
tentacles
--
was
exactly
society
,
exactly
*NL*
the
multiplication
of
shibboleths
,
exactly
the
discrimination
of
types
*NL*
and
tones
,
exactly
the
wicked
old
Rows
of
Chester
,
rank
with
feudalism
;
*NL*
exactly
in
short
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
light
for
observation
,
however
,
in
an
incident
that
occurred
*NL*
just
before
they
turned
back
to
luncheon
.
Waymarsh
had
been
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
exceptionally
mute
and
distant
,
and
something
,
or
*NL*
other
--
Strether
was
never
to
make
out
exactly
what
--
proved
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
too
much
for
him
after
his
comrades
had
stood
for
three
minutes
taking
*NL*
in
,
while
they
leaned
on
an
old
balustrade
that
guarded
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
Row
,
a
particularly
crooked
and
huddled
street-view
.
``
He
thinks
us
*NL*
sophisticated
,
he
thinks
us
worldly
,
he
thinks
us
wicked
,
he
thinks
us
*NL*
all
sorts
of
queer
things
,
''
Strether
reflected
;
for
wondrous
were
the
*NL*
vague
quantities
our
friend
had
within
a
couple
of
short
days
acquired
*NL*
the
habit
of
conveniently
and
conclusively
lumping
together
.
There
*NL*
seemed
moreover
a
direct
connexion
between
some
such
inference
and
a
*NL*
sudden
grim
dash
taken
by
Waymarsh
to
the
opposite
side
.
This
movement
*NL*
was
startlingly
sudden
,
and
his
companions
at
first
supposed
him
to
*NL*
have
espied
,
to
be
pursuing
,
the
glimpse
of
an
acquaintance
.
They
next
*NL*
made
out
,
however
,
that
an
open
door
had
instantly
received
him
,
and
*NL*
they
then
recognised
him
as
engulfed
in
the
establishment
of
a
*NL*
jeweller
,
behind
whose
glittering
front
he
was
lost
to
view
.
The
fact
*NL*
had
somehow
the
note
of
a
demonstration
,
and
it
left
each
of
the
others
*NL*
to
show
a
face
almost
of
fear
.
But
Miss
Gostrey
broke
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
he
ca
n't
stand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
ca
n't
stand
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
.
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
will
that
jeweller
help
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
to
make
it
out
,
from
their
position
,
between
the
*NL*
interstices
of
arrayed
watches
,
of
close-hung
dangling
gewgaws
.
``

'll
*NL*
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
just
what
--
if
he
buys
anything
--
I
'm
afraid
of
:
that
I
shall
*NL*
see
something
rather
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
studied
the
finer
appearances
.
``
He
may
buy
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
follow
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
worlds
.
Besides
we
ca
n't
.
We
're
paralysed
.
We
exchange
a
*NL*
long
scared
look
,
we
publicly
tremble
.
The
thing
is
,
you
see
,
we
*NL*
`
realise

'
He
has
struck
for
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
but
she
laughed
.
``
Ah
what
a
price
to
pay
!
And
I
was
*NL*
preparing
some
for
him
so
cheap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
frankly
amused
now
;
``
do
n't
call
it
that
:
*NL*
the
kind
of
freedom
you
deal
in
is
dear
.
''
Then
as
to
justify
himself
:
*NL*
``
Am
I
not
in
MY
way
trying
it
?
It
's
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
here
,
you
mean
,
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
talking
to
you
as
I
do
.
I
've
known
you
a
few
hours
,
and
I
've
*NL*
known
HIM
all
my
life
;
so
that
if
the
ease
I
thus
take
with
you
about
*NL*
him
is
n't
magnificent
''
--
and
the
thought
of
it
held
him
a
moment
--
``
why
*NL*
it
's
rather
base
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
magnificent
!
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
to
make
an
end
of
it
.
``
And
you
*NL*
should
hear
,
''
she
added
,
``
the
ease
I
take
--
and
I
above
all
intend
to
*NL*
take
--
with
Mr.
Waymarsh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
.
``
About
ME
?
Ah
that
's
no
equivalent
.
The
equivalent
*NL*
would
be
Waymarsh
's
himself
serving
me
up
--
his
remorseless
analysis
of
*NL*
me
.
And
he
'll
never
do
that
''
--
he
was
sadly
clear
.
``
He
'll
never
*NL*
remorselessly
analyse
me
.
''
He
quite
held
her
with
the
authority
of
*NL*
this
.
``
He
'll
never
say
a
word
to
you
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
in
;
she
did
it
justice
;
yet
after
an
instant
her
reason
,
*NL*
her
restless
irony
,
disposed
of
it
.
``
Of
course
he
wo
n't
.
For
what
do
*NL*
you
take
people
,
that
they
're
able
to
say
words
about
anything
,
able
*NL*
remorselessly
to
analyse
?
There
are
not
many
like
you
and
me
.
It
will
*NL*
be
only
because
he
's
too
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
stirred
in
her
friend
a
sceptical
echo
which
was
at
the
same
time
*NL*
the
protest
of
the
faith
of
years
.
``
Waymarsh
stupid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compared
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
still
his
eyes
on
the
jeweller
's
front
,
and
he
waited
a
*NL*
moment
to
answer
.
``
He
's
a
success
of
a
kind
that
I
have
n't
approached
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
he
has
made
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
makes
it
--
to
my
belief
.
And
I
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
though
with
a
back
*NL*
quite
as
bent
,
have
never
made
anything
.
I
'm
a
perfectly
equipped
*NL*
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
feared
an
instant
she
'd
ask
him
if
he
meant
he
was
poor
;
and
he
was
*NL*
glad
she
did
n't
,
for
he
really
did
n't
know
to
what
the
truth
on
this
*NL*
unpleasant
point
might
n't
have
prompted
her
.
She
only
,
however
,
*NL*
confirmed
his
assertion
.
``
Thank
goodness
you
're
a
failure
--
it
's
why
I
*NL*
so
distinguish
you
!
Anything
else
to-day
is
too
hideous
.
Look
about
*NL*
you
--
look
at
the
successes
.
Would
you
BE
one
,
on
your
honour
?
Look
,
*NL*
moreover
,
''
she
continued
,
``
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
little
accordingly
their
eyes
met
.
``
I
see
,
''
Strether
returned
.
*NL*
``
You
too
are
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
superiority
you
discern
in
me
,
''
she
concurred
,
``
announces
my
*NL*
futility
.
If
you
knew
,
''
she
sighed
,
``
the
dreams
of
my
youth
!
But
our
*NL*
realities
are
what
has
brought
us
together
.
We
're
beaten
brothers
in
*NL*
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
at
her
kindly
enough
,
but
he
shook
his
head
.
``
It
does
n't
*NL*
alter
the
fact
that
you
're
expensive
.
You
've
cost
me
already
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
hung
fire
.
``
Cost
you
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
past
--
in
one
great
lump
.
But
no
matter
,
''
he
laughed
:
``
I
'll
*NL*
pay
with
my
last
penny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
attention
had
unfortunately
now
been
engaged
by
their
comrade
's
*NL*
return
,
for
Waymarsh
met
their
view
as
he
came
out
of
his
shop
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
he
has
n't
paid
,
''
she
said
,
``
with
HIS
last
;
though
I
'm
convinced
he
*NL*
has
been
splendid
,
and
has
been
so
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no
--
not
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
as
little
.
''
Waymarsh
was
by
this
time
near
enough
to
show
signs
*NL*
his
friend
could
read
,
though
he
seemed
to
look
almost
carefully
at
*NL*
nothing
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
for
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
nobody
.
For
nothing
.
For
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
freedom
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
answer
was
indirect
.
``
To
be
as
good
as
you
and
me
.
But
*NL*
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
time
to
take
in
their
companion
's
face
;
and
with
it
,
as
*NL*
such
things
were
easy
for
her
,
she
took
in
all
.
``
Different
--
yes
.
But
*NL*
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Waymarsh
was
sombre
he
was
also
indeed
almost
sublime
.
He
told
them
*NL*
nothing
,
left
his
absence
unexplained
,
and
though
they
were
convinced
*NL*
he
had
made
some
extraordinary
purchase
they
were
never
to
learn
its
*NL*
nature
.
He
only
glowered
grandly
at
the
tops
of
the
old
gables
.
``
It
's
*NL*
the
sacred
rage
,
''
Strether
had
had
further
time
to
say
;
and
this
sacred
*NL*
rage
was
to
become
between
them
,
for
convenient
comprehension
,
the
*NL*
description
of
one
of
his
periodical
necessities
.
It
was
Strether
who
*NL*
eventually
contended
that
it
did
make
him
better
than
they
.
But
by
*NL*
that
time
Miss
Gostrey
was
convinced
that
she
did
n't
want
to
be
better
*NL*
than
Strether
.

Those
occasions
on
which
Strether
was
,
in
association
with
the
exile
*NL*
from
Milrose
,
to
see
the
sacred
rage
glimmer
through
would
doubtless
*NL*
have
their
due
periodicity
;
but
our
friend
had
meanwhile
to
find
names
*NL*
for
many
other
matters
.
On
no
evening
of
his
life
perhaps
,
as
he
*NL*
reflected
,
had
he
had
to
supply
so
many
as
on
the
third
of
his
short
*NL*
stay
in
London
;
an
evening
spent
by
Miss
Gostrey
's
side
at
one
of
the
*NL*
theatres
,
to
which
he
had
found
himself
transported
,
without
his
own
*NL*
hand
raised
,
on
the
mere
expression
of
a
conscientious
wonder
.
She
*NL*
knew
her
theatre
,
she
knew
her
play
,
as
she
had
triumphantly
known
,
*NL*
three
days
running
,
everything
else
,
and
the
moment
filled
to
the
brim
,
*NL*
for
her
companion
,
that
apprehension
of
the
interesting
which
,
whether
*NL*
or
no
the
interesting
happened
to
filter
through
his
guide
,
strained
*NL*
now
to
its
limits
his
brief
opportunity
.
Waymarsh
had
n't
come
with
*NL*
them
;
he
had
seen
plays
enough
,
he
signified
,
before
Strether
had
*NL*
joined
him
--
an
affirmation
that
had
its
full
force
when
his
friend
*NL*
ascertained
by
questions
that
he
had
seen
two
and
a
circus
.
Questions
*NL*
as
to
what
he
had
seen
had
on
him
indeed
an
effect
only
less
favourable
*NL*
than
questions
as
to
what
he
had
n't
.
He
liked
the
former
to
be
*NL*
discriminated
;
but
how
could
it
be
done
,
Strether
asked
of
their
*NL*
constant
counsellor
,
without
discriminating
the
latter
?
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
had
dined
with
him
at
his
hotel
,
face
to
face
over
a
small
*NL*
table
on
which
the
lighted
candles
had
rose-coloured
shades
;
and
the
*NL*
rose-coloured
shades
and
the
small
table
and
the
soft
fragrance
of
the
*NL*
lady
--
had
anything
to
his
mere
sense
ever
been
so
soft
?
--
were
so
many
*NL*
touches
in
he
scarce
knew
what
positive
high
picture
.
He
had
been
to
*NL*
the
theatre
,
even
to
the
opera
,
in
Boston
,
with
Mrs.
Newsome
,
more
than
*NL*
once
acting
as
her
only
escort
;
but
there
had
been
no
little
confronted
*NL*
dinner
,
no
pink
lights
,
no
whiff
of
vague
sweetness
,
as
a
preliminary
:
*NL*
one
of
the
results
of
which
was
that
at
present
,
mildly
rueful
,
though
*NL*
with
a
sharpish
accent
,
he
actually
asked
himself
WHY
there
had
n't
.
*NL*
There
was
much
the
same
difference
in
his
impression
of
the
noticed
*NL*
state
of
his
companion
,
whose
dress
was
``
cut
down
,
''
as
he
believed
the
*NL*
term
to
be
,
in
respect
to
shoulders
and
bosom
,
in
a
manner
quite
other
*NL*
than
Mrs.
Newsome
's
,
and
who
wore
round
her
throat
a
broad
red
velvet
*NL*
band
with
an
antique
jewel
--
he
was
rather
complacently
sure
it
was
*NL*
antique
--
attached
to
it
in
front
.
Mrs.
Newsome
's
dress
was
never
in
*NL*
any
degree
``
cut
down
,
''
and
she
never
wore
round
her
throat
a
broad
red
*NL*
velvet
band
:
if
she
had
,
moreover
,
would
it
ever
have
served
so
to
*NL*
carry
on
and
complicate
,
as
he
now
almost
felt
,
his
vision
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
absurd
of
him
to
trace
into
ramifications
the
effect
*NL*
of
the
ribbon
from
which
Miss
Gostrey
's
trinket
depended
,
had
he
not
*NL*
for
the
hour
,
at
the
best
,
been
so
given
over
to
uncontrolled
*NL*
perceptions
.
What
was
it
but
an
uncontrolled
perception
that
his
*NL*
friend
's
velvet
band
somehow
added
,
in
her
appearance
,
to
the
value
of
*NL*
every
other
item
--
to
that
of
her
smile
and
of
the
way
she
carried
her
*NL*
head
,
to
that
of
her
complexion
,
of
her
lips
,
her
teeth
,
her
eyes
,
her
*NL*
hair
?
What
,
certainly
,
had
a
man
conscious
of
a
man
's
work
in
the
*NL*
world
to
do
with
red
velvet
bands
?
He
would
n't
for
anything
have
so
*NL*
exposed
himself
as
to
tell
Miss
Gostrey
how
much
he
liked
hers
,
yet
he
*NL*
HAD
none
the
less
not
only
caught
himself
in
the
act
--
frivolous
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
idiotic
,
and
above
all
unexpected
--
of
liking
it
:
he
had
in
*NL*
addition
taken
it
as
a
starting-point
for
fresh
backward
,
fresh
*NL*
forward
,
fresh
lateral
flights
.
The
manner
in
which
Mrs.
Newsome
's
*NL*
throat
WAS
encircled
suddenly
represented
for
him
,
in
an
alien
order
,
*NL*
almost
as
many
things
as
the
manner
in
which
Miss
Gostrey
's
was
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
wore
,
at
operatic
hours
,
a
black
silk
dress
--
very
handsome
,
he
*NL*
knew
it
was
``
handsome
''
--
and
an
ornament
that
his
memory
was
able
*NL*
further
to
identify
as
a
ruche
.
He
had
his
association
indeed
with
the
*NL*
ruche
,
but
it
was
rather
imperfectly
romantic
.
He
had
once
said
to
the
*NL*
wearer
--
and
it
was
as
``
free
''
a
remark
as
he
had
ever
made
to
her
--
that
*NL*
she
looked
,
with
her
ruff
and
other
matters
,
like
Queen
Elizabeth
;
and
*NL*
it
had
after
this
in
truth
been
his
fancy
that
,
as
a
consequence
of
*NL*
that
tenderness
and
an
acceptance
of
the
idea
,
the
form
of
this
special
*NL*
tribute
to
the
``
frill
''
had
grown
slightly
more
marked
.
The
connexion
,
*NL*
as
he
sat
there
and
let
his
imagination
roam
,
was
to
strike
him
as
*NL*
vaguely
pathetic
;
but
there
it
all
was
,
and
pathetic
was
doubtless
in
*NL*
the
conditions
the
best
thing
it
could
possibly
be
.
It
had
assuredly
*NL*
existed
at
any
rate
;
for
it
seemed
now
to
come
over
him
that
no
*NL*
gentleman
of
his
age
at
Woollett
could
ever
,
to
a
lady
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
's
,
which
was
not
much
less
than
his
,
have
embarked
on
such
a
*NL*
simile
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
sorts
of
things
in
fact
now
seemed
to
come
over
him
,
comparatively
*NL*
few
of
which
his
chronicler
can
hope
for
space
to
mention
.
It
came
*NL*
over
him
for
instance
that
Miss
Gostrey
looked
perhaps
like
Mary
*NL*
Stuart
:
Lambert
Strether
had
a
candour
of
fancy
which
could
rest
for
*NL*
an
instant
gratified
in
such
an
antithesis
.
It
came
over
him
that
*NL*
never
before
--
no
,
literally
never
--
had
a
lady
dined
with
him
at
a
*NL*
public
place
before
going
to
the
play
.
The
publicity
of
the
place
was
*NL*
just
,
in
the
matter
,
for
Strether
,
the
rare
strange
thing
;
it
affected
*NL*
him
almost
as
the
achievement
of
privacy
might
have
affected
a
man
of
a
*NL*
different
experience
.
He
had
married
,
in
the
far-away
years
,
so
young
*NL*
as
to
have
missed
the
time
natural
in
Boston
for
taking
girls
to
the
*NL*
Museum
;
and
it
was
absolutely
true
of
hint
that
--
even
after
the
close
*NL*
of
the
period
of
conscious
detachment
occupying
the
centre
of
his
life
,
*NL*
the
grey
middle
desert
of
the
two
deaths
,
that
of
his
wife
and
that
,
*NL*
ten
years
later
,
of
his
boy
--
he
had
never
taken
any
one
anywhere
.
It
*NL*
came
over
him
in
especial
--
though
the
monition
had
,
as
happened
,
*NL*
already
sounded
,
fitfully
gleamed
,
in
other
forms
--
that
the
business
he
*NL*
had
come
out
on
had
n't
yet
been
so
brought
home
to
him
as
by
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
people
about
him
.
She
gave
him
the
impression
,
his
friend
,
at
*NL*
first
,
more
straight
than
he
got
it
for
himself
--
gave
it
simply
by
*NL*
saying
with
off-hand
illumination
:
``
Oh
yes
,
they
're
types
!
''
--
but
after
*NL*
he
had
taken
it
he
made
to
the
full
his
own
use
of
it
;
both
while
he
*NL*
kept
silence
for
the
four
acts
and
while
he
talked
in
the
intervals
.
It
*NL*
was
an
evening
,
it
was
a
world
of
types
,
and
this
was
a
connexion
above
*NL*
all
in
which
the
figures
and
faces
in
the
stalls
were
interchangeable
*NL*
with
those
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
as
if
the
play
itself
penetrated
him
with
the
naked
elbow
of
*NL*
his
neighbour
,
a
great
stripped
handsome
red-haired
lady
who
conversed
*NL*
with
a
gentleman
on
her
other
side
in
stray
dissyllables
which
had
for
*NL*
his
ear
,
in
the
oddest
way
in
the
world
,
so
much
sound
that
he
wondered
*NL*
they
had
n't
more
sense
;
and
he
recognised
by
the
same
law
,
beyond
the
*NL*
footlights
,
what
he
was
pleased
to
take
for
the
very
flush
of
English
*NL*
life
.
He
had
distracted
drops
in
which
he
could
n't
have
said
if
it
*NL*
were
actors
or
auditors
who
were
most
true
,
and
the
upshot
of
which
,
*NL*
each
time
,
was
the
consciousness
of
new
contacts
.
However
he
viewed
*NL*
his
job
it
was
``
types
''
he
should
have
to
tackle
.
Those
before
him
and
*NL*
around
him
were
not
as
the
types
of
Woollett
,
where
,
for
that
matter
,
*NL*
it
had
begun
to
seem
to
him
that
there
must
only
have
been
the
male
and
*NL*
the
female
.
These
made
two
exactly
,
even
with
the
individual
varieties
.
*NL*
Here
,
on
the
other
hand
,
apart
from
the
personal
and
the
sexual
*NL*
range
--
which
might
be
greater
or
less
--
a
series
of
strong
stamps
had
*NL*
been
applied
,
as
it
were
,
from
without
;
stamps
that
his
observation
*NL*
played
with
as
,
before
a
glass
case
on
a
table
,
it
might
have
passed
*NL*
from
medal
to
medal
and
from
copper
to
gold
.
It
befell
that
in
the
*NL*
drama
precisely
there
was
a
bad
woman
in
a
yellow
frock
who
made
a
*NL*
pleasant
weak
good-looking
young
man
in
perpetual
evening
dress
do
the
*NL*
most
dreadful
things
.
Strether
felt
himself
on
the
whole
not
afraid
of
*NL*
the
yellow
frock
,
but
he
was
vaguely
anxious
over
a
certain
kindness
*NL*
into
which
he
found
himself
drifting
for
its
victim
.
He
had
n't
come
*NL*
out
,
he
reminded
himself
,
to
be
too
kind
,
or
indeed
to
be
kind
at
all
,
*NL*
to
Chadwick
Newsome
.
Would
Chad
also
be
in
perpetual
evening
dress
?
*NL*
He
somehow
rather
hoped
it
--
it
seemed
so
to
add
to
THIS
young
man
's
*NL*
general
amenability
;
though
he
wondered
too
if
,
to
fight
him
with
his
*NL*
own
weapons
,
he
himself
-LRB-
a
thought
almost
startling
-RRB-
would
have
*NL*
likewise
to
be
.
This
young
man
furthermore
would
have
been
much
more
*NL*
easy
to
handle
--
at
least
for
HIM
--
than
appeared
probable
in
respect
to
*NL*
Chad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
up
for
him
with
Miss
Gostrey
that
there
were
things
of
which
*NL*
she
would
really
perhaps
after
all
have
heard
,
and
she
admitted
when
a
*NL*
little
pressed
that
she
was
never
quite
sure
of
what
she
heard
as
*NL*
distinguished
from
things
such
as
,
on
occasions
like
the
present
,
she
*NL*
only
extravagantly
guessed
.
``
I
seem
with
this
freedom
,
you
see
,
to
*NL*
have
guessed
Mr.
Chad
.
He
's
a
young
man
on
whose
head
high
hopes
are
*NL*
placed
at
Woollett
;
a
young
man
a
wicked
woman
has
got
hold
of
and
whom
*NL*
his
family
over
there
have
sent
you
out
to
rescue
.
You
've
accepted
the
*NL*
mission
of
separating
him
from
the
wicked
woman
.
Are
you
quite
sure
*NL*
she
's
very
bad
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
his
manner
showed
it
as
quite
pulling
him
up
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
we
are
.
Would
n't
YOU
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
do
n't
know
.
One
never
does
--
does
one
?
--
beforehand
.
One
can
only
*NL*
judge
on
the
facts
.
Yours
are
quite
new
to
me
;
I
'm
really
not
in
the
*NL*
least
,
as
you
see
,
in
possession
of
them
:
so
it
will
be
awfully
*NL*
interesting
to
have
them
from
you
.
If
you
're
satisfied
,
that
's
all
*NL*
that
's
required
.
I
mean
if
you
're
sure
you
ARE
sure
:
sure
it
wo
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
should
lead
such
a
life
?
Rather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
do
n't
know
,
you
see
,
about
his
life
;
you
've
not
told
me
about
*NL*
his
life
.
She
may
be
charming
--
his
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charming
?
''
--
Strether
stared
before
him
.
``
She
's
base
,
venal-out
of
the
*NL*
streets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
And
HE
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chad
,
wretched
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
type
and
temper
is
he
?
''
she
went
on
as
Strether
had
lapsed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
the
obstinate
.
''
It
was
as
if
for
a
moment
he
had
been
going
to
*NL*
say
more
and
had
then
controlled
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
scarce
what
she
wished
.
``
Do
you
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
was
prompt
.
``
No
.
How
CAN
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
because
of
your
being
so
saddled
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
of
his
mother
,
''
said
Strether
after
a
moment
.
``
He
has
*NL*
darkened
her
admirable
life
.
''
He
spoke
with
austerity
.
``
He
has
*NL*
worried
her
half
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
's
of
course
odious
.
''
She
had
a
pause
as
if
for
renewed
*NL*
emphasis
of
this
truth
,
but
it
ended
on
another
note
.
``
Is
her
life
*NL*
very
admirable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extraordinarily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
so
much
in
the
tone
that
Miss
Gostrey
had
to
devote
another
*NL*
pause
to
the
appreciation
of
it
.
``
And
has
he
only
HER
?
I
do
n't
mean
*NL*
the
bad
woman
in
Paris
,
''
she
quickly
added
--
``
for
I
assure
you
I
*NL*
should
n't
even
at
the
best
be
disposed
to
allow
him
more
than
one
.
But
*NL*
has
he
only
his
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
also
a
sister
,
older
than
himself
and
married
;
and
they
're
both
*NL*
remarkably
fine
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
handsome
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
promptitude
--
almost
,
as
he
might
have
thought
,
this
precipitation
,
*NL*
gave
him
a
brief
drop
;
but
he
came
up
again
.
``
Mrs.
Newsome
,
I
think
,
is
*NL*
handsome
,
though
she
's
not
of
course
,
with
a
son
of
twenty-eight
and
a
*NL*
daughter
of
thirty
,
in
her
very
first
youth
.
She
married
,
however
,
*NL*
extremely
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
wonderful
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
,
``
for
her
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
to
feel
with
a
certain
disquiet
the
pressure
of
it
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
she
's
wonderful
.
Or
rather
,
''
he
went
on
the
next
moment
,
``
I
*NL*
do
say
it
.
It
's
exactly
what
she
IS
--
wonderful
.
But
I
was
n't
thinking
*NL*
of
her
appearance
,
''
he
explained
--
``
striking
as
that
doubtless
is
.
I
*NL*
was
thinking
--
well
,
of
many
other
things
.
''
He
seemed
to
look
at
these
*NL*
as
if
to
mention
some
of
them
;
then
took
,
pulling
himself
up
,
another
*NL*
turn
.
``
About
Mrs.
Pocock
people
may
differ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
daughter
's
name
--
`
Pocock
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
daughter
's
name

''
Strether
sturdily
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
people
may
differ
,
you
mean
,
about
HER
beauty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
everything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
YOU
admire
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
his
friend
a
glance
as
to
show
how
he
could
bear
this
``
I
'm
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
afraid
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
,
``
I
see
her
from
here
!
You
may
say
then
I
see
*NL*
very
fast
and
very
far

I
've
already
shown
you
I
do
.
The
young
man
*NL*
and
the
two
ladies

she
went
on
,
``
are
at
any

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
He
shifted
again
;
she
had
made
it
perhaps
just
a
shade
too
affirmative
*NL*
for
his
nerves
.
``
Oh
I

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

highly

*NL*
*NL*

He
carefully
distinguished

nothing

laughed

*NL*
``
No

Strether
,
``
the

round

*NL*
Ah

knew

jamming

see

how
it

told
on

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
this
more
lightly
.
``
Oh
I
jam
down
the
pedal
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
she
lucidly
returned
,
``
we
must
from
this
moment
bear
on

together

all
our

And
she
forged
ahead

money

*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
as
if
,
while
her
energetic
image
still
held
him
,
her
enquiry
*NL*
fell
short
.
``

he
wished
further
to
explain

your
courage

he
,

however

accommodatingly
threw
out
,

*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.

Gostrey
pursued
,

is
that

views

great

it
simply

be

much
for

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
amused
at
her
notion
of
the
simple
,
but
he
adopted
her
*NL*
formula
.
``
Everything

too
much
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

such

more

Yes

more

*NL*
*NL*
``

not

out

take
it

is

for

I
see
it

her
condition

as
behind

beneath
you

at
the

time
I
see
it
as

you
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
it
does
bear
me
up

Strether
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
as
yours
bears
ME
nothing
more
's
needed

''
With
which
she
*NL*
put
again
her
question
.
``
Has
Mrs.
Newsome
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
heeded
.
``
Oh
plenty

That
's
the
root
of
the
evil

There
's
*NL*
money
,
to
very
large
amounts
,
in
the
concern

Chad
has
had
the
free
*NL*
use

But
if
he
'll
pull
himself
together
and
come
home
,
*NL*
all
the
same
,
he
'll
find
his
account
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
listened
with
all
her
interest
.
``
And
I
hope
to
goodness
you
'll
*NL*
find
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
take
up
his
definite
material
reward
,
''
said
Strether
without
*NL*
acknowledgement
of
this
.
``
He
's
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
.
He
can
*NL*
come
into
the
business
now

he
ca
n't
come
later

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
yes

a
big
brave
bouncing
business

A
roaring
trade

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
shop
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
a
workshop
;
a
great
production
,
a
great
industry
.
The
concern
's
*NL*
a
manufacture
--
and
a
manufacture
that
,
if
it
's
only
properly
looked
*NL*
after
,
may
well
be
on
the
way
to
become
a
monopoly
.
It
's
a
little
thing
*NL*
they
make
--
make
better
,
it
appears
,
than
other
people
can
,
or
than
*NL*
other
people
,
at
any
rate
,
do
.
Mr.
Newsome
,
being
a
man
of
ideas
,
at
*NL*
least
in
that
particular
line
,
''
Strether
explained
,
``
put
them
on
it
*NL*
with
great
effect
,
and
gave
the
place
altogether
,
in
his
time
,
an
*NL*
immense
lift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
place
in
itself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
quite
a
number
of
buildings
;
almost
a
little
industrial
colony
.
*NL*
But
above
all
it
's
a
thing
.
The
article
produced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
IS
the
article
produced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
about
him
as
in
slight
reluctance
to
say
;
then
the
*NL*
curtain
,
which
he
saw
about
to
rise
,
came
to
his
aid
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
next
time
.
''
But
when
the
next
time
came
he
only
said
he
'd
tell
her
*NL*
later
on
--
after
they
should
have
left
the
theatre
;
for
she
had
*NL*
immediately
reverted
to
their
topic
,
and
even
for
himself
the
picture
*NL*
of
the
stage
was
now
overlaid
with
another
image
.
His
postponements
,
*NL*
however
,
made
her
wonder
--
wonder
if
the
article
referred
to
were
*NL*
anything
bad
.
And
she
explained
that
she
meant
improper
or
ridiculous
*NL*
or
wrong
.
But
Strether
,
so
far
as
that
went
,
could
satisfy
her
.
*NL*
``
Unmentionable
?
Oh
no
,
we
constantly
talk
of
it
;
we
are
quite
familiar
*NL*
and
brazen
about
it
.
Only
,
as
a
small
,
trivial
,
rather
ridiculous
*NL*
object
of
the
commonest
domestic
use
,
it
's
just
wanting
in-what
shall
I
*NL*
say
?
Well
,
dignity
,
or
the
least
approach
to
distinction
.
Right
here
*NL*
therefore
,
with
everything
about
us
so
grand
--
!
''
In
short
he
shrank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
false
note
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sadly
.
It
's
vulgar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
not
vulgarer
than
this
.
''
Then
on
his
wondering
as
she
*NL*
herself
had
done
:
``
Than
everything
about
us
.
''
She
seemed
a
trifle
*NL*
irritated
.
``
What
do
you
take
this
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
for
--
comparatively
--
divine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
dreadful
London
theatre
?
It
's
impossible
,
if
you
really
want
to
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
then
,
''
laughed
Strether
,
``
I
DO
N'T
really
want
to
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
between
them
a
pause
,
which
she
,
however
,
still
fascinated
by
*NL*
the
mystery
of
the
production
at
Woollett
,
presently
broke
.
''
`
Rather
*NL*
ridiculous
'
?
Clothes-pins
?
Saleratus
?
Shoe-polish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
brought
him
round
.
``
No
--
you
do
n't
even
`
burn
.
'
I
do
n't
think
,
you
*NL*
know
,
you
'll
guess
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
then
can
I
judge
how
vulgar
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
judge
when
I
do
tell
you
''
--
and
he
persuaded
her
to
patience
.
*NL*
But
it
may
even
now
frankly
be
mentioned
that
he
in
the
sequel
never
*NL*
WAS
to
tell
her
.
He
actually
never
did
so
,
and
it
moreover
oddly
*NL*
occurred
that
by
the
law
,
within
her
,
of
the
incalculable
,
her
desire
*NL*
for
the
information
dropped
and
her
attitude
to
the
question
converted
*NL*
itself
into
a
positive
cultivation
of
ignorance
.
In
ignorance
she
*NL*
could
humour
her
fancy
,
and
that
proved
a
useful
freedom
.
She
could
*NL*
treat
the
little
nameless
object
as
indeed
unnameable
--
she
could
make
*NL*
their
abstention
enormously
definite
.
There
might
indeed
have
been
for
*NL*
Strether
the
portent
of
this
in
what
she
next
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
perhaps
then
because
it
's
so
bad
--
because
your
industry
as
you
*NL*
call
it
,
IS
so
vulgar
--
that
Mr.
Chad
wo
n't
come
back
?
Does
he
feel
the
*NL*
taint
?
Is
he
staying
away
not
to
be
mixed
up
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
Strether
laughed
,
``
it
would
n't
appear
--
would
it
?
--
that
he
feels
*NL*
`
taints
'
!
He
's
glad
enough
of
the
money
from
it
,
and
the
money
's
his
*NL*
whole
basis
.
There
's
appreciation
in
that
--
I
mean
as
to
the
allowance
*NL*
his
mother
has
hitherto
made
him
.
She
has
of
course
the
resource
of
*NL*
cutting
this
allowance
off
;
but
even
then
he
has
unfortunately
,
and
on
*NL*
no
small
scale
,
his
independent
supply
--
money
left
him
by
his
*NL*
grandfather
,
her
own
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
the
fact
you
mention
then
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
,
``
make
it
just
*NL*
more
easy
for
him
to
be
particular
?
Is
n't
he
conceivable
as
fastidious
*NL*
about
the
source
--
the
apparent
and
public
source
--
of
his
income
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
was
able
quite
good-humouredly
to
entertain
the
proposition
.
*NL*
``
The
source
of
his
grandfather
's
wealth
--
and
thereby
of
his
own
share
*NL*
in
it
--
was
not
particularly
noble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
source
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
cast
about
.
``
Well
--
practices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
business
?
Infamies
?
He
was
an
old
swindler
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

he
said
with
more
emphasis
than
spirit
,
``
I
sha
n't
describe
HIM
*NL*
nor
narrate
his
exploits

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
late
Mr.
Newsome

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

about
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
house

And
he
was
different

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
kept
it
up
.
``
Better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friend
for
a
moment
hung
fire
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
comment
on
his
hesitation
was
scarce
the
less
marked
for
being
*NL*
mute
.
``
Thank
you
.
NOW
do
n't
you
see
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
why
the
boy
*NL*

n't
come
home

's
drowning
his

Strether
asked
,

any

shame

to-day
?
The
men
I
speak
of

they
did
as
every
one
does
;

*NL*
-LRB-
besides
being
ancient
history
-RRB-
it
was
all
a
matter
of
appreciation

*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
how
she
understood
.
``
Mrs.
Newsome
has
appreciated

*NL*
``
Ah

them

at

has
remained
exquisite

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
ca

Strether
said

*NL*
``

what

You
DO
N'T

*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
after
a
moment
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
its
effect
.
``
Well
,
her
money
is
spent
,
her
life
conceived
and
*NL*
carried
on
with
a
large
beneficence

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
kind
of
expiation

wrongs

Gracious

she
added
before
he
*NL*
could
speak
,
``
how
intensely
you
make
me
see
her
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

see
her

Strether
dropped
,
``
it

all

*NL*
She
really
seemed
to
have
her

I
feel
that

She
IS

in
spite
of

everything

handsome

*NL*
*NL*
This
at

enlivened
him

``
What
do
you
mean

everything

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I

YOU

With
which
she
had
one
of
her
swift
changes
of
*NL*
ground
.
``
You

the
concern
needs
looking

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far

overcharged

amended

obligingly
thought

for

I
,
not
at

magnificently

*NL*
edit

Strether
pursued
,
``

I
'm
really

rather
disappointed

hurt

seem
never
to
have
heard

*NL*
*NL*
She
neglected
for
a
moment
this
grievance
.
``
And
what
kind
of
a
Review
*NL*
is
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
His
serenity
was
now
completely
restored
.
``
Well

it
's
green

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
in
political
colour

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
Mrs.

it

*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
little
.
``
Oh
as
for
that
you
must
judge
if
she
peeps
out

*NL*
She
's
behind
the

she
's
of
a
delicacy

a
*NL*
discretion

*NL*
*NL*
Miss

took
it
all
.

sure

*NL*
*NL*
``

like
the

rather
one
too

be
so
mixed
up
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
no

said
Strether
,
``
that
's
not
the

*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
already
taken
him
up
.
``
The
way
it
works

you
need
n't
tell
*NL*
me

is
of
course
that
you
efface
yourself
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my

the
cover

he
lucidly
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
you
do
n't
put
it
on
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon

*NL*
exactly
the
thing
that
I
'm
reduced
to
doing
for
myself

It
seems
to
*NL*
rescue
a
little
,
you
see
,
from
the
wreck
of
hopes

ambitions

the
*NL*
refuse-heap
of
disappointments

failures

my
one
presentable
little
*NL*
scrap
of
an
identity

*NL*
*NL*
On
this
she
looked
at
him
as
to
say
many
things
,
but
what
she
at
last
*NL*
simply
said
was
:
``
She
likes
to
see
it
there

You
're
the
bigger
swell
*NL*
of
the
two

''
she
immediately
continued
,
``
because
you
think
you
're
not
*NL*
one

She
thinks
she
IS
one

However
,

Miss
Gostrey
added
,
``
she

all

hold
of

She
embroidered
,
she
abounded
.
``
I
do
n't
say
it

interfere

Strether
*NL*
had
thrown
back
his
head
as
in
silent
mirth
over
something
that
struck
*NL*
him
in
her
audacity
or
felicity
,
and
her
flight
meanwhile
was
already
*NL*
higher
.
``
Therefore
close
with

asked

she
seemed
to
hang
poised

*NL*
``
Before
you
lose
your
chance

Their
eyes
met
over
it

do
you
mean

*NL*
the
things
YOU
do
n't
.
Is
it
her
GREATEST
fad
?
''
she
briskly
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Review
?
''
He
seemed
to
wonder
how
he
could
best
describe
it
.
This
*NL*
resulted
however
but
in
a
sketch
.
``
It
's
her
tribute
to
the
ideal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
You
go
in
for
tremendous
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
go
in
for
the
unpopular
side
--
that
is
so
far
as
we
dare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
far
DO
you
dare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
very
far
.
I
much
less
.
I
do
n't
begin
to
have
her
faith
.
*NL*
She
provides
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
three
fourths
of
that
.
And
she
*NL*
provides
,
as
I
've
confided
to
you
,
ALL
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
evoked
somehow
a
vision
of
gold
that
held
for
a
little
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
's
eyes
,
and
she
looked
as
if
she
heard
the
bright
dollars
*NL*
shovelled
in
.
``
I
hope
then
you
make
a
good
thing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
NEVER
made
a
good
thing
!
''
he
at
once
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
waited
.
``
Do
n't
you
call
it
a
good
thing
to
be
loved
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
we
're
not
loved
.
We
're
not
even
hated
.
We
're
only
just
sweetly
*NL*
ignored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
another
pause
.
``
You
do
n't
trust
me
!
''
she
once
more
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
when
I
lift
the
last
veil
?
--
tell
you
the
very
secret
of
the
*NL*
prison-house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
met
his
eyes
,
but
to
the
result
that
after
an
instant
her
own
*NL*
turned
away
with
impatience
.
``
You
do
n't
sell
?
Oh
I
'm
glad
of
THAT
!
''
*NL*
After
which
however
,
and
before
he
could
protest
,
she
was
off
again
.
*NL*
``
She
's
just
a
MORAL
swell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
accepted
gaily
enough
the
definition
.
``
Yes
--
I
really
think
that
*NL*
describes
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
had
for
his
friend
the
oddest
connexion
.
``
How
does
she
do
her
*NL*
hair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
out
.
``
Beautifully
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
does
n't
tell
me
.
However
,
it
does
n't
matter
--
I
know
.
It
's
*NL*
tremendously
neat
--
a
real
reproach
;
quite
remarkably
thick
and
without
,
*NL*
as
yet
,
a
single
strand
of
white
.
There
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
blushed
for
her
realism
,
but
gaped
at
her
truth
.
``
You
're
the
very
*NL*
deuce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
SHOULD
I
be
?
It
was
as
the
very
deuce
I
pounced
on
you
.
But
*NL*
do
n't
let
it
trouble
you
,
for
everything
but
the
very
deuce
--
at
our
*NL*
age
--
is
a
bore
and
a
delusion
,
and
even
he
himself
,
after
all
,
but
half
*NL*
a
joy
.
''
With
which
,
on
a
single
sweep
of
her
wing
,
she
resumed
.
``
You
*NL*
assist
her
to
expiate
--
which
is
rather
hard
when
you
've
yourself
not
*NL*
sinned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
she
who
has
n't
sinned
,
''
Strether
replied
.
``
I
've
sinned
the
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
cynically
laughed
,
``
what
a
picture
of
HER
!
Have
you
*NL*
robbed
the
widow
and
the
orphan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sinned
enough
,
''
said
Strether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
for
whom
?
Enough
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
be
where
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
They
were
disturbed
at
this
moment
by
the
passage
between
*NL*
their
knees
and
the
back
of
the
seats
before
them
of
a
gentleman
who
*NL*
had
been
absent
during
a
part
of
the
performance
and
who
now
returned
*NL*
for
the
close
;
but
the
interruption
left
Miss
Gostrey
time
,
before
the
*NL*
subsequent
hush
,
to
express
as
a
sharp
finality
her
sense
of
the
moral
*NL*
of
all
their
talk
.
``
I
knew
you
had
something
up
your
sleeve
!
''
This
*NL*
finality
,
however
,
left
them
in
its
turn
,
at
the
end
of
the
play
,
as
*NL*
disposed
to
hang
back
as
if
they
had
still
much
to
say
;
so
that
they
*NL*
easily
agreed
to
let
every
one
go
before
them
--
they
found
an
interest
*NL*
in
waiting
.
They
made
out
from
the
lobby
that
the
night
had
turned
to
*NL*
rain
;
yet
Miss
Gostrey
let
her
friend
know
that
he
was
n't
to
see
her
*NL*
home
.
He
was
simply
to
put
her
,
by
herself
,
into
a
four-wheeler
;
she
*NL*
liked
so
in
London
,
of
wet
nights
after
wild
pleasures
,
thinking
things
*NL*
over
,
on
the
return
,
in
lonely
four-wheelers
.
This
was
her
great
time
,
*NL*
she
intimated
,
for
pulling
herself
together
.
The
delays
caused
by
the
*NL*
weather
,
the
struggle
for
vehicles
at
the
door
,
gave
them
occasion
to
*NL*
subside
on
a
divan
at
the
back
of
the
vestibule
and
just
beyond
the
*NL*
reach
of
the
fresh
damp
gusts
from
the
street
.
Here
Strether
's
comrade
*NL*
resumed
that
free
handling
of
the
subject
to
which
his
own
imagination
*NL*
of
it
already
owed
so
much
.
``
Does
your
young
friend
in
Paris
like
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
almost
,
after
the
interval
,
startled
him
.
``
Oh
I
hope
not
!
Why
*NL*
SHOULD
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
n't
he
?
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
.
``
That
you
're
coming
down
on
*NL*
him
need
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
more
in
it
,
''
he
presently
returned
,
``
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
see
you
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
you
see
more
in
`
me
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Than
you
see
in
yourself
?
Very
likely
.
That
's
always
one
's
right
.
*NL*
What
I
was
thinking
of
,
''
she
explained
,
``
is
the
possible
particular
*NL*
effect
on
him
of
his
milieu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
his
milieu
--
!
''
Strether
really
felt
he
could
imagine
it
better
now
*NL*
than
three
hours
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
it
can
only
have
been
so
lowering
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
's
my
very
starting-point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
start
so
far
back
.
What
do
his
letters
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
He
practically
ignores
us
--
or
spares
us
.
He
does
n't
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
But
there
are
all
the
same
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
two
quite
distinct
*NL*
things
that
--
given
the
wonderful
place
he
's
in
--
may
have
happened
to
*NL*
him
.
One
is
that
he
may
have
got
brutalised
.
The
other
is
that
he
may
*NL*
have
got
refined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
stared
--
this
WAS
a
novelty
.
``
Refined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
quietly
,
``
there
ARE
refinements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
of
it
made
him
,
after
looking
at
her
,
break
into
a
laugh
.
``
YOU
*NL*
have
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
one
of
the
signs
,
''
she
continued
in
the
same
tone
,
``
they
constitute
*NL*
perhaps
the
worst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
it
over
and
his
gravity
returned
.
``
Is
it
a
refinement
not
*NL*
to
answer
his
mother
's
letters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
have
a
scruple
,
but
she
brought
it
out
.
``
Oh
I
should
*NL*
say
the
greatest
of
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
I
'M
quite
content
to
let
it
,
as
one
of
the
*NL*
signs
,
pass
for
the
worst
that
I
know
he
believes
he
can
do
what
he
*NL*
likes
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeared
to
strike
her
.
``
How
do
you
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
'm
sure
of
it
.
I
feel
it
in
my
bones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feel
he
CAN
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feel
that
he
believes
he
can
.
It
may
come
to
the
same
thing
!
''
*NL*
Strether
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
n't
,
however
,
have
this
.
``
Nothing
for
you
will
ever
come
to
*NL*
the
same
thing
as
anything
else
.
''
And
she
understood
what
she
meant
,
*NL*
it
seemed
,
sufficiently
to
go
straight
on
.
``
You
say
that
if
he
does
*NL*
break
he
'll
come
in
for
things
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
positively
.
He
'll
come
in
for
a
particular
chance
--
a
chance
*NL*
that
any
properly
constituted
young
man
would
jump
at
.
The
business
*NL*
has
so
developed
that
an
opening
scarcely
apparent
three
years
ago
,
but
*NL*
which
his
father
's
will
took
account
of
as
in
certain
conditions
*NL*
possible
and
which
,
under
that
will
,
attaches
to
Chad
's
availing
*NL*
himself
of
it
a
large
contingent
advantage
--
this
opening
,
the
*NL*
conditions
having
come
about
,
now
simply
awaits
him
.
His
mother
has
*NL*
kept
it
for
him
,
holding
out
against
strong
pressure
,
till
the
last
*NL*
possible
moment
.
It
requires
,
naturally
,
as
it
carries
with
it
a
*NL*
handsome
`
part
,
'
a
large
share
in
profits
,
his
being
on
the
spot
and
*NL*
making
a
big
effort
for
a
big
result
.
That
's
what
I
mean
by
his
chance
.
*NL*
If
he
misses
it
he
comes
in
,
as
you
say
,
for
nothing
.
And
to
see
that
*NL*
he
does
n't
miss
it
is
,
in
a
word
,
what
I
've
come
out
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
it
all
sink
in
.
``
What
you
've
come
out
for
then
is
simply
to
*NL*
render
him
an
immense
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
poor
Strether
was
willing
to
take
it
so
.
``
Ah
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
stands
,
as
they
say
,
if
you
succeed
with
him
,
to
gain
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
a
lot
of
advantages
.
''
Strether
had
them
clearly
at
his
fingers
'
*NL*
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
which
you
mean
of
course
a
lot
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
only
.
I
'm
acting
with
a
sense
for
him
of
other
things
too
.
*NL*
Consideration
and
comfort
and
security
--
the
general
safety
of
being
*NL*
anchored
by
a
strong
chain
.
He
wants
,
as
I
see
him
,
to
be
protected
.
*NL*
Protected
I
mean
from
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
voila
!
''
--
her
thought
fitted
with
a
click
.
``
From
life
.
What
you
*NL*
REALLY
want
to
get
him
home
for
is
to
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
about
the
size
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
's
rudimentary
.
But
to
any
one
in
*NL*
particular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
at
this
,
looking
a
little
more
conscious
.
``
You
get
*NL*
everything
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
again
their
eyes
met
.
``
You
put
everything
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
acknowledged
the
tribute
by
telling
her
.
``
To
Mamie
Pocock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
;
then
gravely
,
even
exquisitely
,
as
if
to
make
the
oddity
*NL*
also
fit
:
``
His
own
niece
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
must
yourself
find
a
name
for
the
relation
.
His
*NL*
brother-in-law
's
sister
.
Mrs.
Jim
's
sister-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
have
on
Miss
Gostrey
a
certain
hardening
effect
.
``
And
who
*NL*
in
the
world
's
Mrs.
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chad
's
sister
--
who
was
Sarah
Newsome
.
She
's
married
--
did
n't
I
mention
*NL*
it
?
--
to
Jim
Pocock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
yes
,
''
she
tacitly
replied
;
but
he
had
mentioned
things
--
!
Then
,
*NL*
however
,
with
all
the
sound
it
could
have
,
``
Who
in
the
world
's
Jim
*NL*
Pocock
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
Sally
's
husband
.
That
's
the
only
way
we
distinguish
people
at
*NL*
Woollett
,
''
he
good-humoredly
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
a
great
distinction
--
being
Sally
's
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
considered
.
``
I
think
there
can
be
scarcely
a
greater
--
unless
it
may
*NL*
become
one
,
in
the
future

to
be
Chad
's
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
how
do
they
distinguish
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
DO
N'T

except
,
as
I
've
told
you
,
by
the
green
cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
their
eyes
met
on
it
,
and
she
held
him
an
instant
.
``
The
*NL*
green
cover
wo
n't
--
nor
will
ANY
cover

avail
you
with
ME

You
're
of
a
*NL*
depth
of
duplicity
!
''
Still
,
she
could
in
her
own
large
grasp
of
the
*NL*
real
condone
it
.
``
Is
Mamie
a
great
parti
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
the
greatest
we
have
--
our
prettiest
brightest
girl

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
seemed
to
fix
the
poor
child
.
``
I
know
what
they
CAN
be

*NL*
And
with
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
perhaps
with
a
great
deal

so
much

do
n't
miss
it
.
We
DO
N'T
miss
money
much

*NL*
Strether
added
,
``
in
general

in
America
,
in
pretty
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
conceded
;
``
but
I
know
also
what
you
do
sometimes
miss
.
And
do
*NL*
you
,
''
she
asked
,
``
yourself
admire
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
question
,
he
indicated
,
that
there
might
be
several
ways
of
*NL*
taking
;
but
he
decided
after
an
instant
for
the
humorous
.
``
Have
n't
I
*NL*
sufficiently
showed
you
how
I
admire
ANY
pretty
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
interest
in
his
problem
was
by
this
time
such
that
it
scarce
left
*NL*
her
freedom
,
and
she
kept
close
to
the
facts
.
``
I
supposed
that
at
*NL*
Woollett
you
wanted
them
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
--
blameless
.
I
mean
*NL*
your
young
men
for
your
pretty
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
did
I
!
''
Strether
confessed
.
``
But
you
strike
there
a
curious
*NL*
fact
--
the
fact
that
Woollett
too
accommodates
itself
to
the
spirit
of
*NL*
the
age
and
the
increasing
mildness
of
manners
.
Everything
changes
,
*NL*
and
I
hold
that
our
situation
precisely
marks
a
date
.
We
SHOULD
prefer
*NL*
them
blameless
,
but
we
have
to
make
the
best
of
them
as
we
find
them
.
*NL*
Since
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
the
increasing
mildness
send
them
so
*NL*
much
more
to
Paris
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
to
take
them
back
as
they
come
.
When
they
DO
come
.
Bon
!
''
Once
*NL*
more
she
embraced
it
all
,
but
she
had
a
moment
of
thought
.
``
Poor
Chad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Strether
cheerfully
``
Mamie
will
save
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
looking
away
,
still
in
her
vision
,
and
she
spoke
with
*NL*
impatience
and
almost
as
if
he
had
n't
understood
her
.
``
YOU
'LL
save
*NL*
him
.
That
's
who
'll
save
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
with
Mamie
's
aid
.
Unless
indeed
you
mean
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
I
*NL*
shall
effect
so
much
more
with
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
at
last
again
look
at
him
.
``
You
'll
do
more
--
as
you
're
so
*NL*
much
better
--
than
all
of
us
put
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'm
only
better
since
I
've
known
YOU
!
''
Strether
bravely
*NL*
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
depletion
of
the
place
,
the
shrinkage
of
the
crowd
and
now
*NL*
comparatively
quiet
withdrawal
of
its
last
elements
had
already
brought
*NL*
them
nearer
the
door
and
put
them
in
relation
with
a
messenger
of
whom
*NL*
he
bespoke
Miss
Gostrey
's
cab
.
But
this
left
them
a
few
minutes
more
,
*NL*
which
she
was
clearly
in
no
mood
not
to
use
.
``
You
've
spoken
to
me
of
*NL*
what
--
by
your
success
--
Mr.
Chad
stands
to
gain
.
But
you
've
not
spoken
*NL*
to
me
of
what
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
've
nothing
more
to
gain
,
''
said
Strether
very
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
as
even
quite
too
simple
.
``
You
mean
you
've
got
it
all
*NL*
`
down
'
?
You
've
been
paid
in
advance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
do
n't
talk
about
payment
!
''
he
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
tone
of
it
pulled
her
up
,
but
as
their
messenger
still
*NL*
delayed
she
had
another
chance
and
she
put
it
in
another
way
.
``
What
--
by
*NL*
failure
--
do
you
stand
to
lose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
,
however
,
would
n't
have
it
.
``
Nothing
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
and
on
*NL*
the
messenger
's
at
this
instant
reappearing
he
was
able
to
sink
the
*NL*
subject
in
their
responsive
advance
.
When
,
a
few
steps
up
the
street
,
*NL*
under
a
lamp
,
he
had
put
her
into
her
four-wheeler
and
she
had
asked
*NL*
him
if
the
man
had
called
for
him
no
second
conveyance
,
he
replied
*NL*
before
the
door
was
closed
.
``
You
wo
n't
take
me
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
rain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
rain
,
''
said
Strether
.
``
Good-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
him
a
moment
,
while
his
hand
was
on
the
door
,
by
not
*NL*
answering
;
after
which
she
answered
by
repeating
her
question
.
``
What
do
*NL*
you
stand
to
lose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
the
question
now
affected
him
as
other
he
could
n't
have
said
;
he
*NL*
could
only
this
time
meet
it
otherwise
.
``
Everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
thought
.
Then
you
shall
succeed
.
And
to
that
end
I
'm
yours
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
dear
lady
!
''
he
kindly
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
death
!
''
said
Maria
Gostrey
.
``
Good-night
.
''

II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
called
,
his
second
morning
in
Paris
,
on
the
bankers
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Scribe
to
whom
his
letter
of
credit
was
addressed
,
and
he
made
this
*NL*
visit
attended
by
Waymarsh
,
in
whose
company
he
had
crossed
from
London
*NL*
two
days
before
.
They
had
hastened
to
the
Rue
Scribe
on
the
morrow
of
*NL*
their
arrival
,
but
Strether
had
not
then
found
the
letters
the
hope
of
*NL*
which
prompted
this
errand
.
He
had
had
as
yet
none
at
all
;
had
n't
*NL*
expected
them
in
London
,
but
had
counted
on
several
in
Paris
,
and
,
*NL*
disconcerted
now
,
had
presently
strolled
back
to
the
Boulevard
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
injury
that
he
felt
himself
taking
for
as
good
a
start
as
any
*NL*
other
.
It
would
serve
,
this
spur
to
his
spirit
,
he
reflected
,
as
,
*NL*
pausing
at
the
top
of
the
street
,
he
looked
up
and
down
the
great
*NL*
foreign
avenue
,
it
would
serve
to
begin
business
with
.
His
idea
was
to
*NL*
begin
business
immediately
,
and
it
did
much
for
him
the
rest
of
his
day
*NL*
that
the
beginning
of
business
awaited
him
.
He
did
little
else
till
*NL*
night
but
ask
himself
what
he
should
do
if
he
had
n't
fortunately
had
so
*NL*
much
to
do
;
but
he
put
himself
the
question
in
many
different
*NL*
situations
and
connexions
.
What
carried
him
hither
and
yon
was
an
*NL*
admirable
theory
that
nothing
he
could
do
would
n't
be
in
some
manner
*NL*
related
to
what
he
fundamentally
had
on
hand
,
or
WOULD
be
--
should
he
*NL*
happen
to
have
a
scruple
--
wasted
for
it
.
He
did
happen
to
have
a
*NL*
scruple
--
a
scruple
about
taking
no
definite
step
till
he
should
get
*NL*
letters
;
but
this
reasoning
carried
it
off
.
A
single
day
to
feel
his
*NL*
feet
--
he
had
felt
them
as
yet
only
at
Chester
and
in
London
--
was
he
*NL*
could
consider
,
none
too
much
;
and
having
,
as
he
had
often
privately
*NL*
expressed
it
,
Paris
to
reckon
with
,
he
threw
these
hours
of
freshness
*NL*
consciously
into
the
reckoning
.
They
made
it
continually
greater
,
but
*NL*
that
was
what
it
had
best
be
if
it
was
to
be
anything
at
all
,
and
he
*NL*
gave
himself
up
till
far
into
the
evening
,
at
the
theatre
and
on
the
*NL*
return
,
after
the
theatre
,
along
the
bright
congested
Boulevard
,
to
*NL*
feeling
it
grow
.
Waymarsh
had
accompanied
him
this
time
to
the
play
,
*NL*
and
the
two
men
had
walked
together
,
as
a
first
stage
,
from
the
Gymnase
*NL*
to
the
Cafe
Riche
,
into
the
crowded
``
terrace
''
of
which
*NL*
establishment
--
the
night
,
or
rather
the
morning
,
for
midnight
had
*NL*
struck
,
being
bland
and
populous
--
they
had
wedged
themselves
for
*NL*
refreshment
.
Waymarsh
,
as
a
result
of
some
discussion
with
his
friend
,
*NL*
had
made
a
marked
virtue
of
his
having
now
let
himself
go
;
and
there
*NL*
had
been
elements
of
impression
in
their
half-hour
over
their
watered
*NL*
beer-glasses
that
gave
him
his
occasion
for
conveying
that
he
held
this
*NL*
compromise
with
his
stiffer
self
to
have
become
extreme
.
He
conveyed
*NL*
it
--
for
it
was
still
,
after
all
,
his
stiffer
self
who
gloomed
out
of
*NL*
the
glare
of
the
terrace
--
in
solemn
silence
;
and
there
was
indeed
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
critical
silence
,
every
way
,
between
the
companions
,
even
*NL*
till
they
gained
the
Place
de
l'Opera
,
as
to
the
character
of
their
*NL*
nocturnal
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
there
WERE
letters
--
letters
which
had
reached
London
,
*NL*
apparently
all
together
,
the
day
of
Strether
's
journey
,
and
had
taken
*NL*
their
time
to
follow
him
;
so
that
,
after
a
controlled
impulse
to
go
*NL*
into
them
in
the
reception-room
of
the
bank
,
which
,
reminding
him
of
*NL*
the
post-office
at
Woollett
,
affected
him
as
the
abutment
of
some
*NL*
transatlantic
bridge
,
he
slipped
them
into
the
pocket
of
his
loose
grey
*NL*
overcoat
with
a
sense
of
the
felicity
of
carrying
them
off
.
Waymarsh
,
*NL*
who
had
had
letters
yesterday
,
had
had
them
again
to-day
,
and
Waymarsh
*NL*
suggested
in
this
particular
no
controlled
impulses
.
The
last
one
he
*NL*
was
at
all
events
likely
to
be
observed
to
struggle
with
was
clearly
*NL*
that
of
bringing
to
a
premature
close
any
visit
to
the
Rue
Scribe
.
*NL*
Strether
had
left
him
there
yesterday
;
he
wanted
to
see
the
papers
,
and
*NL*
he
had
spent
,
by
what
his
friend
could
make
out
,
a
succession
of
hours
*NL*
with
the
papers
.
He
spoke
of
the
establishment
,
with
emphasis
,
as
a
*NL*
post
of
superior
observation
;
just
as
he
spoke
generally
of
his
actual
*NL*
damnable
doom
as
a
device
for
hiding
from
him
what
was
going
on
.
Europe
*NL*
was
best
described
,
to
his
mind
,
as
an
elaborate
engine
for
*NL*
dissociating
the
confined
American
from
that
indispensable
knowledge
,
*NL*
and
was
accordingly
only
rendered
bearable
by
these
occasional
stations
*NL*
of
relief
,
traps
for
the
arrest
of
wandering
western
airs
.
Strether
,
*NL*
on
his
side
,
set
himself
to
walk
again
--
he
had
his
relief
in
his
*NL*
pocket
;
and
indeed
,
much
as
he
had
desired
his
budget
,
the
growth
of
*NL*
restlessness
might
have
been
marked
in
him
from
the
moment
he
had
*NL*
assured
himself
of
the
superscription
of
most
of
the
missives
it
*NL*
contained
.
This
restlessness
became
therefore
his
temporary
law
;
he
*NL*
knew
he
should
recognise
as
soon
as
see
it
the
best
place
of
all
for
*NL*
settling
down
with
his
chief
correspondent
.
He
had
for
the
next
hour
*NL*
an
accidental
air
of
looking
for
it
in
the
windows
of
shops
;
he
came
*NL*
down
the
Rue
de
la
Paix
in
the
sun
and
,
passing
across
the
Tuileries
*NL*
and
the
river
,
indulged
more
than
once
--
as
if
on
finding
himself
*NL*
determined
--
in
a
sudden
pause
before
the
book-stalls
of
the
opposite
*NL*
quay
.
In
the
garden
of
the
Tuileries
he
had
lingered
,
on
two
or
three
*NL*
spots
,
to
look
;
it
was
as
if
the
wonderful
Paris
spring
had
stayed
him
*NL*
as
he
roamed
.
The
prompt
Paris
morning
struck
its
cheerful
notes
--
in
a
*NL*
soft
breeze
and
a
sprinkled
smell
,
in
the
light
flit
,
over
the
*NL*
garden-floor
,
of
bareheaded
girls
with
the
buckled
strap
of
oblong
*NL*
boxes
,
in
the
type
of
ancient
thrifty
persons
basking
betimes
where
*NL*
terrace-walls
were
warm
,
in
the
blue-frocked
brass-labelled
officialism
*NL*
of
humble
rakers
and
scrapers
,
in
the
deep
references
of
a
*NL*
straight-pacing
priest
or
the
sharp
ones
of
a
white-gaitered
red-legged
*NL*
soldier
.
He
watched
little
brisk
figures
,
figures
whose
movement
was
*NL*
as
the
tick
of
the
great
Paris
clock
,
take
their
smooth
diagonal
from
*NL*
point
to
point
;
the
air
had
a
taste
as
of
something
mixed
with
art
,
*NL*
something
that
presented
nature
as
a
white-capped
master-chef
.
The
*NL*
palace
was
gone
,
Strether
remembered
the
palace
;
and
when
he
gazed
into
*NL*
the
irremediable
void
of
its
site
the
historic
sense
in
him
might
have
*NL*
been
freely
at
play
--
the
play
under
which
in
Paris
indeed
it
so
often
*NL*
winces
like
a
touched
nerve
.
He
filled
out
spaces
with
dim
symbols
of
*NL*
scenes
;
he
caught
the
gleam
of
white
statues
at
the
base
of
which
,
with
*NL*
his
letters
out
,
he
could
tilt
back
a
straw-bottomed
chair
.
But
his
*NL*
drift
was
,
for
reasons
,
to
the
other
side
,
and
it
floated
him
unspent
*NL*
up
the
Rue
de
Seine
and
as
far
as
the
Luxembourg
.
In
the
Luxembourg
*NL*
Gardens
he
pulled
up
;
here
at
last
he
found
his
nook
,
and
here
,
on
a
*NL*
penny
chair
from
which
terraces
,
alleys
,
vistas
,
fountains
,
little
*NL*
trees
in
green
tubs
,
little
women
in
white
caps
and
shrill
little
girls
*NL*
at
play
all
sunnily
``
composed
''
together
,
he
passed
an
hour
in
which
the
*NL*
cup
of
his
impressions
seemed
truly
to
overflow
.
But
a
week
had
elapsed
*NL*
since
he
quitted
the
ship
,
and
there
were
more
things
in
his
mind
than
*NL*
so
few
days
could
account
for
.
More
than
once
,
during
the
time
,
he
had
*NL*
regarded
himself
as
admonished
;
but
the
admonition
this
morning
was
*NL*
formidably
sharp
.
It
took
as
it
had
n't
done
yet
the
form
of
a
*NL*
question
--
the
question
of
what
he
was
doing
with
such
an
extraordinary
*NL*
sense
of
escape
.
This
sense
was
sharpest
after
he
had
read
his
*NL*
letters
,
but
that
was
also
precisely
why
the
question
pressed
.
Four
of
*NL*
the
letters
were
from
Mrs.
Newsome
and
none
of
them
short
;
she
had
lost
*NL*
no
time
,
had
followed
on
his
heels
while
he
moved
,
so
expressing
*NL*
herself
that
he
now
could
measure
the
probable
frequency
with
which
he
*NL*
should
hear
.
They
would
arrive
,
it
would
seem
,
her
communications
,
at
*NL*
the
rate
of
several
a
week
;
he
should
be
able
to
count
,
it
might
even
*NL*
prove
,
on
more
than
one
by
each
mail
.
If
he
had
begun
yesterday
with
a
*NL*
small
grievance
he
had
therefore
an
opportunity
to
begin
to-day
with
*NL*
its
opposite
.
He
read
the
letters
successively
and
slowly
,
putting
*NL*
others
back
into
his
pocket
but
keeping
these
for
a
long
time
*NL*
afterwards
gathered
in
his
lap
.
He
held
them
there
,
lost
in
thought
,
*NL*
as
if
to
prolong
the
presence
of
what
they
gave
him
;
or
as
if
at
the
*NL*
least
to
assure
them
their
part
in
the
constitution
of
some
lucidity
.
*NL*
His
friend
wrote
admirably
,
and
her
tone
was
even
more
in
her
style
*NL*
than
in
her
voice
--
he
might
almost
,
for
the
hour
,
have
had
to
come
this
*NL*
distance
to
get
its
full
carrying
quality
;
yet
the
plentitude
of
his
*NL*
consciousness
of
difference
consorted
perfectly
with
the
deepened
*NL*
intensity
of
the
connexion
.
It
was
the
difference
,
the
difference
of
*NL*
being
just
where
he
was
and
AS
he
was
,
that
formed
the
escape
--
this
*NL*
difference
was
so
much
greater
than
he
had
dreamed
it
would
be
;
and
*NL*
what
he
finally
sat
there
turning
over
was
the
strange
logic
of
his
*NL*
finding
himself
so
free
.
He
felt
it
in
a
manner
his
duty
to
think
out
*NL*
his
state
,
to
approve
the
process
,
and
when
he
came
in
fact
to
trace
*NL*
the
steps
and
add
up
the
items
they
sufficiently
accounted
for
the
sum
.
*NL*
He
had
never
expected
--
that
was
the
truth
of
it
--
again
to
find
himself
*NL*
young
,
and
all
the
years
and
other
things
it
had
taken
to
make
him
so
*NL*
were
exactly
his
present
arithmetic
.
He
had
to
make
sure
of
them
to
*NL*
put
his
scruple
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
all
sprang
at
bottom
from
the
beauty
of
Mrs.
Newsome
's
desire
that
*NL*
he
should
be
worried
with
nothing
that
was
not
of
the
essence
of
his
*NL*
task
;
by
insisting
that
he
should
thoroughly
intermit
and
break
she
had
*NL*
so
provided
for
his
freedom
that
she
would
,
as
it
were
,
have
only
*NL*
herself
to
thank
.
Strether
could
not
at
this
point
indeed
have
*NL*
completed
his
thought
by
the
image
of
what
she
might
have
to
thank
*NL*
herself
FOR
:
the
image
,
at
best
,
of
his
own
likeness-poor
Lambert
*NL*
Strether
washed
up
on
the
sunny
strand
by
the
waves
of
a
single
day
,
*NL*
poor
Lambert
Strether
thankful
for
breathing-time
and
stiffening
*NL*
himself
while
he
gasped
.
There
he
was
,
and
with
nothing
in
his
aspect
*NL*
or
his
posture
to
scandalise
:
it
was
only
true
that
if
he
had
seen
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
coming
he
would
instinctively
have
jumped
up
to
walk
away
a
*NL*
little
.
He
would
have
come
round
and
back
to
her
bravely
,
but
he
would
*NL*
have
had
first
to
pull
himself
together
.
She
abounded
in
news
of
the
*NL*
situation
at
home
,
proved
to
him
how
perfectly
she
was
arranging
for
*NL*
his
absence
,
told
him
who
would
take
up
this
and
who
take
up
that
*NL*
exactly
where
he
had
left
it
,
gave
him
in
fact
chapter
and
verse
for
*NL*
the
moral
that
nothing
would
suffer
.
It
filled
for
him
,
this
tone
of
*NL*
hers
,
all
the
air
;
yet
it
struck
him
at
the
same
time
as
the
hum
of
*NL*
vain
things
.
This
latter
effect
was
what
he
tried
to
justify
--
and
with
*NL*
the
success
that
,
grave
though
the
appearance
,
he
at
last
lighted
on
a
*NL*
form
that
was
happy
.
He
arrived
at
it
by
the
inevitable
recognition
of
*NL*
his
having
been
a
fortnight
before
one
of
the
weariest
of
men
.
If
ever
*NL*
a
man
had
come
off
tired
Lambert
Strether
was
that
man
;
and
had
n't
it
*NL*
been
distinctly
on
the
ground
of
his
fatigue
that
his
wonderful
friend
*NL*
at
home
had
so
felt
for
him
and
so
contrived
?
It
seemed
to
him
somehow
*NL*
at
these
instants
that
,
could
he
only
maintain
with
sufficient
firmness
*NL*
his
grasp
of
that
truth
,
it
might
become
in
a
manner
his
compass
and
*NL*
his
helm
.
What
he
wanted
most
was
some
idea
that
would
simplify
,
and
*NL*
nothing
would
do
this
so
much
as
the
fact
that
he
was
done
for
and
*NL*
finished
.
If
it
had
been
in
such
a
light
that
he
had
just
detected
in
*NL*
his
cup
the
dregs
of
youth
,
that
was
a
mere
flaw
of
the
surface
of
his
*NL*
scheme
.
He
was
so
distinctly
fagged-out
that
it
must
serve
precisely
*NL*
as
his
convenience
,
and
if
he
could
but
consistently
be
good
for
little
*NL*
enough
he
might
do
everything
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
he
wanted
was
comprised
moreover
in
a
single
boon
--
the
*NL*
common
unattainable
art
of
taking
things
as
they
came
.
He
appeared
to
*NL*
himself
to
have
given
his
best
years
to
an
active
appreciation
of
the
*NL*
way
they
did
n't
come
;
but
perhaps
--
as
they
would
seemingly
here
be
*NL*
things
quite
other
--
this
long
ache
might
at
last
drop
to
rest
.
He
*NL*
could
easily
see
that
from
the
moment
he
should
accept
the
notion
of
*NL*
his
foredoomed
collapse
the
last
thing
he
would
lack
would
be
reasons
*NL*
and
memories
.
Oh
if
he
SHOULD
do
the
sum
no
slate
would
hold
the
*NL*
figures
!
The
fact
that
he
had
failed
,
as
he
considered
,
in
everything
,
*NL*
in
each
relation
and
in
half
a
dozen
trades
,
as
he
liked
luxuriously
to
*NL*
put
it
,
might
have
made
,
might
still
make
,
for
an
empty
present
;
but
it
*NL*
stood
solidly
for
a
crowded
past
.
It
had
not
been
,
so
much
achievement
*NL*
missed
,
a
light
yoke
nor
a
short
load
.
It
was
at
present
as
if
*NL*
the
backward
picture
had
hung
there
,
the
long
crooked
course
,
grey
in
*NL*
the
shadow
of
his
solitude
.
It
had
been
a
dreadful
cheerful
sociable
*NL*
solitude
,
a
solitude
of
life
or
choice
,
of
community
;
but
though
there
*NL*
had
been
people
enough
all
round
it
there
had
been
but
three
or
four
*NL*
persons
IN
it
.
Waymarsh
was
one
of
these
,
and
the
fact
struck
him
just
*NL*
now
as
marking
the
record
.
Mrs.
Newsome
was
another
,
and
Miss
Gostrey
*NL*
had
of
a
sudden
shown
signs
of
becoming
a
third
.
Beyond
,
behind
them
*NL*
was
the
pale
figure
of
his
real
youth
,
which
held
against
its
breast
*NL*
the
two
presences
paler
than
itself
--
the
young
wife
he
had
early
lost
*NL*
and
the
young
son
he
had
stupidly
sacrificed
.
He
had
again
and
again
*NL*
made
out
for
himself
that
he
might
have
kept
his
little
boy
,
his
little
*NL*
dull
boy
who
had
died
at
school
of
rapid
diphtheria
,
if
he
had
not
in
*NL*
those
years
so
insanely
given
himself
to
merely
missing
the
mother
.
It
*NL*
was
the
soreness
of
his
remorse
that
the
child
had
in
all
likelihood
*NL*
not
really
been
dull
--
had
been
dull
,
as
he
had
been
banished
and
*NL*
neglected
,
mainly
because
the
father
had
been
unwittingly
selfish
.
This
*NL*
was
doubtless
but
the
secret
habit
of
sorrow
,
which
had
slowly
given
*NL*
way
to
time
;
yet
there
remained
an
ache
sharp
enough
to
make
the
*NL*
spirit
,
at
the
sight
now
and
again
of
some
fair
young
man
just
growing
*NL*
up
,
wince
with
the
thought
of
an
opportunity
lost
.
Had
ever
a
man
,
he
*NL*
had
finally
fallen
into
the
way
of
asking
himself
,
lost
so
much
and
*NL*
even
done
so
much
for
so
little
?
There
had
been
particular
reasons
why
*NL*
all
yesterday
,
beyond
other
days
,
he
should
have
had
in
one
ear
this
*NL*
cold
enquiry
.
His
name
on
the
green
cover
,
where
he
had
put
it
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
,
expressed
him
doubtless
just
enough
to
make
the
*NL*
world
--
the
world
as
distinguished
,
both
for
more
and
for
less
,
from
*NL*
Woollett
--
ask
who
he
was
.
He
had
incurred
the
ridicule
of
having
to
*NL*
have
his
explanation
explained
.
He
was
Lambert
Strether
because
he
was
*NL*
on
the
cover
,
whereas
it
should
have
been
,
for
anything
like
glory
,
*NL*
that
he
was
on
the
cover
because
he
was
Lambert
Strether
.
He
would
*NL*
have
done
anything
for
Mrs.
Newsome
,
have
been
still
more
*NL*
ridiculous
--
as
he
might
,
for
that
matter
,
have
occasion
to
be
yet
;
*NL*
which
came
to
saying
that
this
acceptance
of
fate
was
all
he
had
to
*NL*
show
at
fifty-five
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
judged
the
quantity
as
small
because
it
WAS
small
,
and
all
the
more
*NL*
egregiously
since
it
could
n't
,
as
he
saw
the
case
,
so
much
as
thinkably
*NL*
have
been
larger
.
He
had
n't
had
the
gift
of
making
the
most
of
what
he
*NL*
tried
,
and
if
he
had
tried
and
tried
again
--
no
one
but
himself
knew
how
*NL*
often
--
it
appeared
to
have
been
that
he
might
demonstrate
what
else
,
in
*NL*
default
of
that
,
COULD
be
made
.
Old
ghosts
of
experiments
came
back
to
*NL*
him
,
old
drudgeries
and
delusions
,
and
disgusts
,
old
recoveries
with
*NL*
their
relapses
,
old
fevers
with
their
chills
,
broken
moments
of
good
*NL*
faith
,
others
of
still
better
doubt
;
adventures
,
for
the
most
part
,
of
*NL*
the
sort
qualified
as
lessons
.
The
special
spring
that
had
constantly
*NL*
played
for
him
the
day
before
was
the
recognition
--
frequent
enough
to
*NL*
surprise
him
--
of
the
promises
to
himself
that
he
had
after
his
other
*NL*
visit
never
kept
.
The
reminiscence
to-day
most
quickened
for
him
was
*NL*
that
of
the
vow
taken
in
the
course
of
the
pilgrimage
that
,
*NL*
newly-married
,
with
the
War
just
over
,
and
helplessly
young
in
spite
of
*NL*
it
,
he
had
recklessly
made
with
the
creature
who
was
so
much
younger
*NL*
still
.
It
had
been
a
bold
dash
,
for
which
they
had
taken
money
set
*NL*
apart
for
necessities
,
but
kept
sacred
at
the
moment
in
a
hundred
ways
,
*NL*
and
in
none
more
so
than
by
this
private
pledge
of
his
own
to
treat
the
*NL*
occasion
as
a
relation
formed
with
the
higher
culture
and
see
that
,
as
*NL*
they
said
at
Woollett
,
it
should
bear
a
good
harvest
.
He
had
believed
,
*NL*
sailing
home
again
,
that
he
had
gained
something
great
,
and
his
*NL*
theory
--
with
an
elaborate
innocent
plan
of
reading
,
digesting
,
coming
*NL*
back
even
,
every
few
years
--
had
then
been
to
preserve
,
cherish
and
*NL*
extend
it
.
As
such
plans
as
these
had
come
to
nothing
,
however
,
in
*NL*
respect
to
acquisitions
still
more
precious
,
it
was
doubtless
little
*NL*
enough
of
a
marvel
that
he
should
have
lost
account
of
that
handful
of
*NL*
seed
.
Buried
for
long
years
in
dark
corners
at
any
rate
these
few
*NL*
germs
had
sprouted
again
under
forty-eight
hours
of
Paris
.
The
process
*NL*
of
yesterday
had
really
been
the
process
of
feeling
the
general
stirred
*NL*
life
of
connexions
long
since
individually
dropped
.
Strether
had
*NL*
become
acquainted
even
on
this
ground
with
short
gusts
of
*NL*
speculation
--
sudden
flights
of
fancy
in
Louvre
galleries
,
hungry
gazes
*NL*
through
clear
plates
behind
which
lemon-coloured
volumes
were
as
fresh
*NL*
as
fruit
on
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
instants
at
which
he
could
ask
whether
,
since
there
had
been
*NL*
fundamentally
so
little
question
of
his
keeping
anything
,
the
fate
*NL*
after
all
decreed
for
him
had
n't
been
only
to
BE
kept
.
Kept
for
*NL*
something
,
in
that
event
,
that
he
did
n't
pretend
,
did
n't
possibly
dare
*NL*
as
yet
to
divine
;
something
that
made
him
hover
and
wonder
and
laugh
*NL*
and
sigh
,
made
him
advance
and
retreat
,
feeling
half
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
impulse
to
plunge
and
more
than
half
afraid
of
his
impulse
to
wait
.
He
*NL*
remembered
for
instance
how
he
had
gone
back
in
the
sixties
with
*NL*
lemon-coloured
volumes
in
general
on
the
brain
as
well
as
with
a
*NL*
dozen
--
selected
for
his
wife
too
--
in
his
trunk
;
and
nothing
had
at
the
*NL*
moment
shown
more
confidence
than
this
invocation
of
the
finer
taste
.
*NL*
They
were
still
somewhere
at
home
,
the
dozen
--
stale
and
soiled
and
*NL*
never
sent
to
the
binder
;
but
what
had
become
of
the
sharp
initiation
*NL*
they
represented
?
They
represented
now
the
mere
sallow
paint
on
the
*NL*
door
of
the
temple
of
taste
that
he
had
dreamed
of
raising
up
--
a
*NL*
structure
he
had
practically
never
carried
further
.
Strether
's
present
*NL*
highest
flights
were
perhaps
those
in
which
this
particular
lapse
*NL*
figured
to
him
as
a
symbol
,
a
symbol
of
his
long
grind
and
his
want
of
*NL*
odd
moments
,
his
want
moreover
of
money
,
of
opportunity
,
of
positive
*NL*
dignity
.
That
the
memory
of
the
vow
of
his
youth
should
,
in
order
to
*NL*
throb
again
,
have
had
to
wait
for
this
last
,
as
he
felt
it
,
of
all
his
*NL*
accidents
--
that
was
surely
proof
enough
of
how
his
conscience
had
been
*NL*
encumbered
.
If
any
further
proof
were
needed
it
would
have
been
to
be
*NL*
found
in
the
fact
that
,
as
he
perfectly
now
saw
,
he
had
ceased
even
to
*NL*
measure
his
meagreness
,
a
meagreness
that
sprawled
,
in
this
retrospect
,
*NL*
vague
and
comprehensive
,
stretching
back
like
some
unmapped
Hinterland
*NL*
from
a
rough
coast-settlement
.
His
conscience
had
been
amusing
itself
*NL*
for
the
forty-eight
hours
by
forbidding
him
the
purchase
of
a
book
;
he
*NL*
held
off
from
that
,
held
off
from
everything
;
from
the
moment
he
did
n't
*NL*
yet
call
on
Chad
he
would
n't
for
the
world
have
taken
any
other
step
.
*NL*
On
this
evidence
,
however
,
of
the
way
they
actually
affected
him
he
*NL*
glared
at
the
lemon-coloured
covers
in
confession
of
the
*NL*
subconsciousness
that
,
all
the
same
,
in
the
great
desert
of
the
years
,
*NL*
he
must
have
had
of
them
.
The
green
covers
at
home
comprised
,
by
the
*NL*
law
of
their
purpose
,
no
tribute
to
letters
;
it
was
of
a
mere
rich
*NL*
kernel
of
economics
,
politics
,
ethics
that
,
glazed
and
,
as
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
maintained
rather
against
HIS
view
,
pre-eminently
pleasant
to
touch
,
*NL*
they
formed
the
specious
shell
.
Without
therefore
any
needed
*NL*
instinctive
knowledge
of
what
was
coming
out
,
in
Paris
,
on
the
bright
*NL*
highway
,
he
struck
himself
at
present
as
having
more
than
once
flushed
*NL*
with
a
suspicion
:
he
could
n't
otherwise
at
present
be
feeling
so
many
*NL*
fears
confirmed
.
There
were
``
movements
''
he
was
too
late
for
:
were
n't
*NL*
they
,
with
the
fun
of
them
,
already
spent
?
There
were
sequences
he
had
*NL*
missed
and
great
gaps
in
the
procession
:
he
might
have
been
watching
*NL*
it
all
recede
in
a
golden
cloud
of
dust
.
If
the
playhouse
was
n't
*NL*
closed
his
seat
had
at
least
fallen
to
somebody
else
.
He
had
had
an
*NL*
uneasy
feeling
the
night
before
that
if
he
was
at
the
theatre
at
*NL*
all
--
though
he
indeed
justified
the
theatre
,
in
the
specific
sense
,
and
*NL*
with
a
grotesqueness
to
which
his
imagination
did
all
honour
,
as
*NL*
something
he
owed
poor
Waymarsh
--
he
should
have
been
there
with
,
and
as
*NL*
might
have
been
said
,
FOR
Chad
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
suggested
the
question
of
whether
he
could
properly
have
taken
him
*NL*
to
such
a
play
,
and
what
effect
--
it
was
a
point
that
suddenly
rose
--
his
*NL*
peculiar
responsibility
might
be
held
in
general
to
have
on
his
choice
*NL*
of
entertainment
.
It
had
literally
been
present
to
him
at
the
*NL*
Gymnase
--
where
one
was
held
moreover
comparatively
safe
--
that
having
*NL*
his
young
friend
at
his
side
would
have
been
an
odd
feature
of
the
work
*NL*
of
redemption
;
and
this
quite
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
picture
*NL*
presented
might
well
,
confronted
with
Chad
's
own
private
stage
,
have
*NL*
seemed
the
pattern
of
propriety
.
He
clearly
had
n't
come
out
in
the
*NL*
name
of
propriety
but
to
visit
unattended
equivocal
performances
;
yet
*NL*
still
less
had
he
done
so
to
undermine
his
authority
by
sharing
them
*NL*
with
the
graceless
youth
.
Was
he
to
renounce
all
amusement
for
the
*NL*
sweet
sake
of
that
authority
?
and
WOULD
such
renouncement
give
him
for
*NL*
Chad
a
moral
glamour
?
The
little
problem
bristled
the
more
by
reason
*NL*
of
poor
Strether
's
fairly
open
sense
of
the
irony
of
things
.
Were
*NL*
there
then
sides
on
which
his
predicament
threatened
to
look
rather
*NL*
droll
to
him
?
Should
he
have
to
pretend
to
believe
--
either
to
himself
*NL*
or
the
wretched
boy
--
that
there
was
anything
that
could
make
the
latter
*NL*
worse
?
Was
n't
some
such
pretence
on
the
other
hand
involved
in
the
*NL*
assumption
of
possible
processes
that
would
make
him
better
?
His
*NL*
greatest
uneasiness
seemed
to
peep
at
him
out
of
the
imminent
*NL*
impression
that
almost
any
acceptance
of
Paris
might
give
one
's
*NL*
authority
away
.
It
hung
before
him
this
morning
,
the
vast
bright
*NL*
Babylon
,
like
some
huge
iridescent
object
,
a
jewel
brilliant
and
hard
,
*NL*
in
which
parts
were
not
to
be
discriminated
nor
differences
comfortably
*NL*
marked
.
It
twinkled
and
trembled
and
melted
together
,
and
what
seemed
*NL*
all
surface
one
moment
seemed
all
depth
the
next
.
It
was
a
place
of
*NL*
which
,
unmistakeably
,
Chad
was
fond
;
wherefore
if
he
,
Strether
,
should
*NL*
like
it
too
much
,
what
on
earth
,
with
such
a
bond
,
would
become
of
*NL*
either
of
them
?
It
all
depended
of
course
--
which
was
a
gleam
of
*NL*
light
--
on
how
the
``
too
much
''
was
measured
;
though
indeed
our
friend
*NL*
fairly
felt
,
while
he
prolonged
the
meditation
I
describe
,
that
for
*NL*
himself
even
already
a
certain
measure
had
been
reached
.
It
will
have
*NL*
been
sufficiently
seen
that
he
was
not
a
man
to
neglect
any
good
chance
*NL*
for
reflexion
.
Was
it
at
all
possible
for
instance
to
like
Paris
*NL*
enough
without
liking
it
too
much
?
He
luckily
however
had
n't
promised
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
not
to
like
it
at
all
.
He
was
ready
to
recognise
at
this
*NL*
stage
that
such
an
engagement
WOULD
have
tied
his
hands
.
The
*NL*
Luxembourg
Gardens
were
incontestably
just
so
adorable
at
this
hour
by
*NL*
reason
--
in
addition
to
their
intrinsic
charm
--
of
his
not
having
taken
*NL*
it
.
The
only
engagement
he
had
taken
,
when
he
looked
the
thing
in
the
*NL*
face
,
was
to
do
what
he
reasonably
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
upset
him
a
little
none
the
less
and
after
a
while
to
find
himself
*NL*
at
last
remembering
on
what
current
of
association
he
had
been
floated
*NL*
so
far
.
Old
imaginations
of
the
Latin
Quarter
had
played
their
part
*NL*
for
him
,
and
he
had
duly
recalled
its
having
been
with
this
scene
of
*NL*
rather
ominous
legend
that
,
like
so
many
young
men
in
fiction
as
well
*NL*
as
in
fact
,
Chad
had
begun
.
He
was
now
quite
out
of
it
,
with
his
*NL*
``
home
,
''
as
Strether
figured
the
place
,
in
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
;
*NL*
which
was
perhaps
why
,
repairing
,
not
to
fail
of
justice
either
,
to
the
*NL*
elder
neighbourhood
,
our
friend
had
felt
he
could
allow
for
the
element
*NL*
of
the
usual
,
the
immemorial
,
without
courting
perturbation
.
He
was
*NL*
not
at
least
in
danger
of
seeing
the
youth
and
the
particular
Person
*NL*
flaunt
by
together
;
and
yet
he
was
in
the
very
air
of
which
--
just
to
*NL*
feel
what
the
early
natural
note
must
have
been
--
he
wished
most
to
take
*NL*
counsel
.
It
became
at
once
vivid
to
him
that
he
had
originally
had
,
*NL*
for
a
few
days
,
an
almost
envious
vision
of
the
boy
's
romantic
*NL*
privilege
.
Melancholy
Murger
,
with
Francine
and
Musette
and
Rodolphe
,
*NL*
at
home
,
in
the
company
of
the
tattered
,
one
--
if
he
not
in
his
single
*NL*
self
two
or
three
--
of
the
unbound
,
the
paper-covered
dozen
on
the
*NL*
shelf
;
and
when
Chad
had
written
,
five
years
ago
,
after
a
sojourn
then
*NL*
already
prolonged
to
six
months
,
that
he
had
decided
to
go
in
for
*NL*
economy
and
the
real
thing
,
Strether
's
fancy
had
quite
fondly
*NL*
accompanied
him
in
this
migration
,
which
was
to
convey
him
,
as
they
*NL*
somewhat
confusedly
learned
at
Woollett
,
across
the
bridges
and
up
the
*NL*
Montagne
Sainte-Genevieve
.
This
was
the
region
--
Chad
had
been
quite
*NL*
distinct
about
it
--
in
which
the
best
French
,
and
many
other
things
,
*NL*
were
to
be
learned
at
least
cost
,
and
in
which
all
sorts
of
clever
*NL*
fellows
,
compatriots
there
for
a
purpose
,
formed
an
awfully
pleasant
*NL*
set
.
The
clever
fellows
,
the
friendly
countrymen
were
mainly
young
*NL*
painters
,
sculptors
,
architects
,
medical
students
;
but
they
were
,
Chad
*NL*
sagely
opined
,
a
much
more
profitable
lot
to
be
with
--
even
on
the
*NL*
footing
of
not
being
quite
one
of
them
--
than
the
``
terrible
toughs
''
*NL*
-LRB-
Strether
remembered
the
edifying
discrimination
-RRB-
of
the
American
bars
*NL*
and
banks
roundabout
the
Opera
.
Chad
had
thrown
out
,
in
the
*NL*
communications
following
this
one
--
for
at
that
time
he
did
once
in
a
*NL*
while
communicate
--
that
several
members
of
a
band
of
earnest
workers
*NL*
under
one
of
the
great
artists
had
taken
him
right
in
,
making
him
dine
*NL*
every
night
,
almost
for
nothing
,
at
their
place
,
and
even
pressing
him
*NL*
not
to
neglect
the
hypothesis
of
there
being
as
much
``
in
him
''
as
in
any
*NL*
of
them
.
There
had
been
literally
a
moment
at
which
it
appeared
there
*NL*
might
be
something
in
him
;
there
had
been
at
any
rate
a
moment
at
which
*NL*
he
had
written
that
he
did
n't
know
but
what
a
month
or
two
more
might
*NL*
see
him
enrolled
in
some
atelier
.
The
season
had
been
one
at
which
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
was
moved
to
gratitude
for
small
mercies
;
it
had
broken
on
*NL*
them
all
as
a
blessing
that
their
absentee
HAD
perhaps
a
*NL*
conscience
--
that
he
was
sated
in
fine
with
idleness
,
was
ambitious
of
*NL*
variety
.
The
exhibition
was
doubtless
as
yet
not
brilliant
,
but
*NL*
Strether
himself
,
even
by
that
time
much
enlisted
and
immersed
,
had
*NL*
determined
,
on
the
part
of
the
two
ladies
,
a
temperate
approval
and
in
*NL*
fact
,
as
he
now
recollected
,
a
certain
austere
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
very
next
thing
that
happened
had
been
a
dark
drop
of
the
*NL*
curtain
.
The
son
and
brother
had
not
browsed
long
on
the
Montagne
*NL*
Sainte-Genevieve
--
his
effective
little
use
of
the
name
of
which
,
like
*NL*
his
allusion
to
the
best
French
,
appeared
to
have
been
but
one
of
the
*NL*
notes
of
his
rough
cunning
.
The
light
refreshment
of
these
vain
*NL*
appearances
had
not
accordingly
carried
any
of
them
very
far
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
it
had
gained
Chad
time
;
it
had
given
him
a
chance
,
*NL*
unchecked
,
to
strike
his
roots
,
had
paved
the
way
for
initiations
more
*NL*
direct
and
more
deep
.
It
was
Strether
's
belief
that
he
had
been
*NL*
comparatively
innocent
before
this
first
migration
,
and
even
that
the
*NL*
first
effects
of
the
migration
would
not
have
been
,
without
some
*NL*
particular
bad
accident
,
to
have
been
deplored
.
There
had
been
three
*NL*
months
--
he
had
sufficiently
figured
it
out
--
in
which
Chad
had
wanted
to
*NL*
try
.
He
HAD
tried
,
though
not
very
hard
--
he
had
had
his
little
hour
of
*NL*
good
faith
.
The
weakness
of
this
principle
in
him
was
that
almost
any
*NL*
accident
attestedly
bad
enough
was
stronger
.
Such
had
at
any
rate
*NL*
markedly
been
the
case
for
the
precipitation
of
a
special
series
of
*NL*
impressions
.
They
had
proved
,
successively
,
these
impressions
--
all
of
*NL*
Musette
and
Francine
,
but
Musette
and
Francine
vulgarised
by
the
larger
*NL*
evolution
of
the
type
--
irresistibly
sharp
:
he
had
``
taken
up
,
''
by
what
*NL*
was
at
the
time
to
be
shrinkingly
gathered
,
as
it
was
scantly
*NL*
mentioned
,
with
one
ferociously
``
interested
''
little
person
after
*NL*
another
.
Strether
had
read
somewhere
of
a
Latin
motto
,
a
description
*NL*
of
the
hours
,
observed
on
a
clock
by
a
traveller
in
Spain
;
and
he
had
*NL*
been
led
to
apply
it
in
thought
to
Chad
's
number
one
,
number
two
,
*NL*
number
three
.
Omnes
vulnerant
,
ultima
necat
--
they
had
all
morally
*NL*
wounded
,
the
last
had
morally
killed
.
The
last
had
been
longest
in
*NL*
possession
--
in
possession
,
that
is
,
of
whatever
was
left
of
the
poor
*NL*
boy
's
finer
mortality
.
And
it
had
n't
been
she
,
it
had
been
one
of
her
*NL*
early
predecessors
,
who
had
determined
the
second
migration
,
the
*NL*
expensive
return
and
relapse
,
the
exchange
again
,
as
was
fairly
to
be
*NL*
presumed
,
of
the
vaunted
best
French
for
some
special
variety
of
the
*NL*
worst
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
himself
then
at
last
together
for
his
own
progress
back
;
not
*NL*
with
the
feeling
that
he
had
taken
his
walk
in
vain
.
He
prolonged
it
a
*NL*
little
,
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
,
after
he
had
quitted
his
chair
;
*NL*
and
the
upshot
of
the
whole
morning
for
him
was
that
his
campaign
had
*NL*
begun
.
He
had
wanted
to
put
himself
in
relation
,
and
he
would
be
*NL*
hanged
if
he
were
NOT
in
relation
.
He
was
that
at
no
moment
so
much
as
*NL*
while
,
under
the
old
arches
of
the
Odeon
,
he
lingered
before
the
*NL*
charming
open-air
array
of
literature
classic
and
casual
.
He
found
the
*NL*
effect
of
tone
and
tint
,
in
the
long
charged
tables
and
shelves
,
*NL*
delicate
and
appetising
;
the
impression
--
substituting
one
kind
of
*NL*
low-priced
consommation
for
another
--
might
have
been
that
of
one
of
the
*NL*
pleasant
cafes
that
overlapped
,
under
an
awning
,
to
the
pavement
;
but
*NL*
he
edged
along
,
grazing
the
tables
,
with
his
hands
firmly
behind
him
.
*NL*
He
was
n't
there
to
dip
,
to
consume
--
he
was
there
to
reconstruct
.
He
*NL*
was
n't
there
for
his
own
profit
--
not
,
that
is
,
the
direct
;
he
was
there
*NL*
on
some
chance
of
feeling
the
brush
of
the
wing
of
the
stray
spirit
of
*NL*
youth
.
He
felt
it
in
fact
,
he
had
it
beside
him
;
the
old
arcade
*NL*
indeed
,
as
his
inner
sense
listened
,
gave
out
the
faint
sound
,
as
from
*NL*
far
off
,
of
the
wild
waving
of
wings
.
They
were
folded
now
over
the
*NL*
breasts
of
buried
generations
;
but
a
flutter
or
two
lived
again
in
the
*NL*
turned
page
of
shock-headed
slouch-hatted
loiterers
whose
young
*NL*
intensity
of
type
,
in
the
direction
of
pale
acuteness
,
deepened
his
*NL*
vision
,
and
even
his
appreciation
,
of
racial
differences
,
and
whose
*NL*
manipulation
of
the
uncut
volume
was
too
often
,
however
,
but
a
*NL*
listening
at
closed
doors
.
He
reconstructed
a
possible
groping
Chad
of
*NL*
three
or
four
years
before
,
a
Chad
who
had
,
after
all
,
simply
--
for
that
*NL*
was
the
only
way
to
see
it
--
been
too
vulgar
for
his
privilege
.
Surely
*NL*
it
WAS
a
privilege
to
have
been
young
and
happy
just
there
.
Well
,
the
*NL*
best
thing
Strether
knew
of
him
was
that
he
had
had
such
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
own
actual
business
half
an
hour
later
was
with
a
third
floor
*NL*
on
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
--
so
much
as
that
was
definite
;
and
the
*NL*
fact
of
the
enjoyment
by
the
third-floor
windows
of
a
continuous
*NL*
balcony
,
to
which
he
was
helped
by
this
knowledge
,
had
perhaps
*NL*
something
to
do
with
his
lingering
for
five
minutes
on
the
opposite
*NL*
side
of
the
street
.
There
were
points
as
to
which
he
had
quite
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
one
of
these
bore
precisely
on
the
wisdom
of
the
*NL*
abruptness
to
which
events
had
finally
committed
him
,
a
policy
that
he
*NL*
was
pleased
to
find
not
at
all
shaken
as
he
now
looked
at
his
watch
and
*NL*
wondered
.
He
HAD
announced
himself
--
six
months
before
;
had
written
out
*NL*
at
least
that
Chad
was
n't
to
be
surprised
should
he
see
him
some
day
*NL*
turn
up
.
Chad
had
thereupon
,
in
a
few
words
of
rather
carefully
*NL*
colourless
answer
,
offered
him
a
general
welcome
;
and
Strether
,
*NL*
ruefully
reflecting
that
he
might
have
understood
the
warning
as
a
hint
*NL*
to
hospitality
,
a
bid
for
an
invitation
,
had
fallen
back
upon
silence
*NL*
as
the
corrective
most
to
his
own
taste
.
He
had
asked
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
moreover
not
to
announce
him
again
;
he
had
so
distinct
an
opinion
on
*NL*
his
attacking
his
job
,
should
he
attack
it
at
all
,
in
his
own
way
.
Not
*NL*
the
least
of
this
lady
's
high
merits
for
him
was
that
he
could
*NL*
absolutely
rest
on
her
word
.
She
was
the
only
woman
he
had
known
,
even
*NL*
at
Woollett
,
as
to
whom
his
conviction
was
positive
that
to
lie
was
*NL*
beyond
her
art
.
Sarah
Pocock
,
for
instance
,
her
own
daughter
,
though
*NL*
with
social
ideals
,
as
they
said
,
in
some
respects
different
--
Sarah
who
*NL*
WAS
,
in
her
way
,
aesthetic
,
had
never
refused
to
human
commerce
that
*NL*
mitigation
of
rigour
;
there
were
occasions
when
he
had
distinctly
seen
*NL*
her
apply
it
.
Since
,
accordingly
,
at
all
events
,
he
had
had
it
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
that
she
had
,
at
whatever
cost
to
her
more
strenuous
view
,
*NL*
conformed
,
in
the
matter
of
preparing
Chad
,
wholly
to
his
restrictions
,
*NL*
he
now
looked
up
at
the
fine
continuous
balcony
with
a
safe
sense
that
*NL*
if
the
case
had
been
bungled
the
mistake
was
at
least
his
property
.
Was
*NL*
there
perhaps
just
a
suspicion
of
that
in
his
present
pause
on
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
Boulevard
and
well
in
the
pleasant
light
?
*NL*
*NL*
Many
things
came
over
him
here
,
and
one
of
them
was
that
he
should
*NL*
doubtless
presently
know
whether
he
had
been
shallow
or
sharp
.
Another
*NL*
was
that
the
balcony
in
question
did
n't
somehow
show
as
a
convenience
*NL*
easy
to
surrender
.
Poor
Strether
had
at
this
very
moment
to
recognise
*NL*
the
truth
that
wherever
one
paused
in
Paris
the
imagination
reacted
*NL*
before
one
could
stop
it
.
This
perpetual
reaction
put
a
price
,
if
one
*NL*
would
,
on
pauses
;
but
it
piled
up
consequences
till
there
was
scarce
*NL*
room
to
pick
one
's
steps
among
them
.
What
call
had
he
,
at
such
a
*NL*
juncture
,
for
example
,
to
like
Chad
's
very
house
?
High
broad
clear
--
he
*NL*
was
expert
enough
to
make
out
in
a
moment
that
it
was
admirably
*NL*
built
--
it
fairly
embarrassed
our
friend
by
the
quality
that
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
said
,
it
``
sprang
''
on
him
.
He
had
struck
off
the
fancy
that
*NL*
it
might
,
as
a
preliminary
,
be
of
service
to
him
to
be
seen
,
by
a
happy
*NL*
accident
,
from
the
third-story
windows
,
which
took
all
the
March
sun
,
*NL*
but
of
what
service
was
it
to
find
himself
making
out
after
a
moment
*NL*
that
the
quality
``
sprung
,
''
the
quality
produced
by
measure
and
balance
,
*NL*
the
fine
relation
of
part
to
part
and
space
to
space
,
was
*NL*
probably
--
aided
by
the
presence
of
ornament
as
positive
as
it
was
*NL*
discreet
,
and
by
the
complexion
of
the
stone
,
a
cold
fair
grey
,
warmed
*NL*
and
polished
a
little
by
life
--
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
case
of
*NL*
distinction
,
such
a
case
as
he
could
only
feel
unexpectedly
as
a
sort
*NL*
of
delivered
challenge
?
Meanwhile
,
however
,
the
chance
he
had
allowed
*NL*
for
--
the
chance
of
being
seen
in
time
from
the
balcony
--
had
become
a
*NL*
fact
.
Two
or
three
of
the
windows
stood
open
to
the
violet
air
;
and
,
*NL*
before
Strether
had
cut
the
knot
by
crossing
,
a
young
man
had
come
out
*NL*
and
looked
about
him
,
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
tossed
the
match
*NL*
over
,
and
then
,
resting
on
the
rail
,
had
given
himself
up
to
watching
*NL*
the
life
below
while
he
smoked
.
His
arrival
contributed
,
in
its
order
,
*NL*
to
keeping
Strether
in
position
;
the
result
of
which
in
turn
was
that
*NL*
Strether
soon
felt
himself
noticed
.
The
young
man
began
to
look
at
him
*NL*
as
in
acknowledgement
of
his
being
himself
in
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
interesting
so
far
as
it
went
,
but
the
interest
was
affected
*NL*
by
the
young
man
's
not
being
Chad
.
Strether
wondered
at
first
if
he
*NL*
were
perhaps
Chad
altered
,
and
then
saw
that
this
was
asking
too
much
*NL*
of
alteration
.
The
young
man
was
light
bright
and
alert
--
with
an
air
*NL*
too
pleasant
to
have
been
arrived
at
by
patching
.
Strether
had
*NL*
conceived
Chad
as
patched
,
but
not
beyond
recognition
.
He
was
in
*NL*
presence
,
he
felt
,
of
amendments
enough
as
they
stood
;
it
was
a
*NL*
sufficient
amendment
that
the
gentleman
up
there
should
be
Chad
's
*NL*
friend
.
He
was
young
too
then
,
the
gentleman
up
there
--
he
was
very
*NL*
young
;
young
enough
apparently
to
be
amused
at
an
elderly
watcher
,
to
*NL*
be
curious
even
to
see
what
the
elderly
watcher
would
do
on
finding
*NL*
himself
watched
.
There
was
youth
in
that
,
there
was
youth
in
the
*NL*
surrender
to
the
balcony
,
there
was
youth
for
Strether
at
this
moment
*NL*
in
everything
but
his
own
business
;
and
Chad
's
thus
pronounced
*NL*
association
with
youth
had
given
the
next
instant
an
extraordinary
*NL*
quick
lift
to
the
issue
.
The
balcony
,
the
distinguished
front
,
*NL*
testified
suddenly
,
for
Strether
's
fancy
,
to
something
that
was
up
and
*NL*
up
;
they
placed
the
whole
case
materially
,
and
as
by
an
admirable
*NL*
image
,
on
a
level
that
he
found
himself
at
the
end
of
another
moment
*NL*
rejoicing
to
think
he
might
reach
.
The
young
man
looked
at
him
still
,
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
young
man
;
and
the
issue
,
by
a
rapid
process
,
was
that
*NL*
this
knowledge
of
a
perched
privacy
appeared
to
him
the
last
of
*NL*
luxuries
.
To
him
too
the
perched
privacy
was
open
,
and
he
saw
it
now
*NL*
but
in
one
light
--
that
of
the
only
domicile
,
the
only
fireside
,
in
the
*NL*
great
ironic
city
,
on
which
he
had
the
shadow
of
a
claim
.
Miss
Gostrey
*NL*
had
a
fireside
;
she
had
told
him
of
it
,
and
it
was
something
that
*NL*
doubtless
awaited
him
;
but
Miss
Gostrey
had
n't
yet
arrived
--
she
*NL*
might
n't
arrive
for
days
;
and
the
sole
attenuation
of
his
excluded
*NL*
state
was
his
vision
of
the
small
,
the
admittedly
secondary
hotel
in
*NL*
the
bye-street
from
the
Rue
de
la
Paix
,
in
which
her
solicitude
for
his
*NL*
purse
had
placed
him
,
which
affected
him
somehow
as
all
indoor
chill
,
*NL*
glass-roofed
court
and
slippery
staircase
,
and
which
,
by
the
same
*NL*
token
,
expressed
the
presence
of
Waymarsh
even
at
times
when
Waymarsh
*NL*
might
have
been
certain
to
be
round
at
the
bank
.
It
came
to
pass
*NL*
before
he
moved
that
Waymarsh
,
and
Waymarsh
alone
,
Waymarsh
not
only
*NL*
undiluted
but
positively
strengthened
,
struck
him
as
the
present
*NL*
alternative
to
the
young
man
in
the
balcony
.
When
he
did
move
it
was
*NL*
fairly
to
escape
that
alternative
.
Taking
his
way
over
the
street
at
*NL*
last
and
passing
through
the
porte-cochere
of
the
house
was
like
*NL*
consciously
leaving
Waymarsh
out
.
However
,
he
would
tell
him
all
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Book
Third
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
told
Waymarsh
all
about
it
that
very
evening
,
on
their
dining
*NL*
together
at
the
hotel
;
which
need
n't
have
happened
,
he
was
all
the
*NL*
while
aware
,
had
n't
he
chosen
to
sacrifice
to
this
occasion
a
rarer
*NL*
opportunity
.
The
mention
to
his
companion
of
the
sacrifice
was
*NL*
moreover
exactly
what
introduced
his
recital
--
or
,
as
he
would
have
*NL*
called
it
with
more
confidence
in
his
interlocutor
,
his
confession
.
His
*NL*
confession
was
that
he
had
been
captured
and
that
one
of
the
features
*NL*
of
the
affair
had
just
failed
to
be
his
engaging
himself
on
the
spot
to
*NL*
dinner
.
As
by
such
a
freedom
Waymarsh
would
have
lost
him
he
had
*NL*
obeyed
his
scruple
;
and
he
had
likewise
obeyed
another
scruple
--
which
*NL*
bore
on
the
question
of
his
himself
bringing
a
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
looked
gravely
ardent
,
over
the
finished
soup
,
at
this
array
*NL*
of
scruples
;
Strether
had
n't
yet
got
quite
used
to
being
so
unprepared
*NL*
for
the
consequences
of
the
impression
he
produced
.
It
was
*NL*
comparatively
easy
to
explain
,
however
,
that
he
had
n't
felt
sure
his
*NL*
guest
would
please
.
The
person
was
a
young
man
whose
acquaintance
he
*NL*
had
made
but
that
afternoon
in
the
course
of
rather
a
hindered
enquiry
*NL*
for
another
person
--
an
enquiry
his
new
friend
had
just
prevented
in
*NL*
fact
from
being
vain
.
``
Oh
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
I
've
all
sorts
of
things
*NL*
to
tell
you
!
''
--
and
he
put
it
in
a
way
that
was
a
virtual
hint
to
*NL*
Waymarsh
to
help
him
to
enjoy
the
telling
.
He
waited
for
his
fish
,
he
*NL*
drank
of
his
wine
,
he
wiped
his
long
moustache
,
he
leaned
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
,
he
took
in
the
two
English
ladies
who
had
just
creaked
past
them
*NL*
and
whom
he
would
even
have
articulately
greeted
if
they
had
n't
rather
*NL*
chilled
the
impulse
;
so
that
all
he
could
do
was
--
by
way
of
doing
*NL*
something
--
to
say
``
Merci
,
Francois
!
''
out
quite
loud
when
his
fish
was
*NL*
brought
.
Everything
was
there
that
he
wanted
,
everything
that
could
*NL*
make
the
moment
an
occasion
,
that
would
do
beautifully
--
everything
but
*NL*
what
Waymarsh
might
give
.
The
little
waxed
salle-a-manger
was
sallow
*NL*
and
sociable
;
Francois
,
dancing
over
it
,
all
smiles
,
was
a
man
and
a
*NL*
brother
;
the
high-shouldered
patronne
,
with
her
high-held
,
much-rubbed
*NL*
hands
,
seemed
always
assenting
exuberantly
to
something
unsaid
;
the
*NL*
Paris
evening
in
short
was
,
for
Strether
,
in
the
very
taste
of
the
*NL*
soup
,
in
the
goodness
,
as
he
was
innocently
pleased
to
think
it
,
of
the
*NL*
wine
,
in
the
pleasant
coarse
texture
of
the
napkin
and
the
crunch
of
*NL*
the
thick-crusted
bread
.
These
all
were
things
congruous
with
his
*NL*
confession
,
and
his
confession
was
that
he
HAD
--
it
would
come
out
*NL*
properly
just
there
if
Waymarsh
would
only
take
it
properly
--
agreed
to
*NL*
breakfast
out
,
at
twelve
literally
,
the
next
day
.
He
did
n't
quite
know
*NL*
where
;
the
delicacy
of
the
case
came
straight
up
in
the
remembrance
of
*NL*
his
new
friend
's
``
We
'll
see
;
I
'll
take
you
somewhere
!
''
--
for
it
had
*NL*
required
little
more
than
that
,
after
all
,
to
let
him
right
in
.
He
was
*NL*
affected
after
a
minute
,
face
to
face
with
his
actual
comrade
,
by
the
*NL*
impulse
to
overcolour
.
There
had
already
been
things
in
respect
to
*NL*
which
he
knew
himself
tempted
by
this
perversity
.
If
Waymarsh
thought
*NL*
them
bad
he
should
at
least
have
his
reason
for
his
discomfort
;
so
*NL*
Strether
showed
them
as
worse
.
Still
,
he
was
now
,
in
his
way
,
*NL*
sincerely
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
been
absent
from
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
--
was
absent
from
*NL*
Paris
altogether
;
he
had
learned
that
from
the
concierge
,
but
had
*NL*
nevertheless
gone
up
,
and
gone
up
--
there
were
no
two
ways
about
*NL*
it
--
from
an
uncontrollable
,
a
really
,
if
one
would
,
depraved
curiosity
.
*NL*
The
concierge
had
mentioned
to
him
that
a
friend
of
the
tenant
of
the
*NL*
troisieme
was
for
the
time
in
possession
;
and
this
had
been
Strether
's
*NL*
pretext
for
a
further
enquiry
,
an
experiment
carried
on
,
under
Chad
's
*NL*
roof
,
without
his
knowledge
.
``
I
found
his
friend
in
fact
there
keeping
*NL*
the
place
warm
,
as
he
called
it
,
for
him
;
Chad
himself
being
,
as
*NL*
appears
,
in
the
south
.
He
went
a
month
ago
to
Cannes
and
though
his
*NL*
return
begins
to
be
looked
for
it
ca
n't
be
for
some
days
.
I
might
,
you
*NL*
see
,
perfectly
have
waited
a
week
;
might
have
beaten
a
retreat
as
soon
*NL*
as
I
got
this
essential
knowledge
.
But
I
beat
no
retreat
;
I
did
the
*NL*
opposite
;
I
stayed
,
I
dawdled
,
I
trifled
;
above
all
I
looked
round
.
I
*NL*
saw
,
in
fine
;
and
--
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
it
--
I
sniffed
.
It
's
a
*NL*
detail
,
but
it
's
as
if
there
were
something
--
something
very
good
--
TO
*NL*
sniff

''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
face
had
shown
his
friend
an
attention
apparently
so
remote
*NL*
that
the
latter
was
slightly
surprised
to
find
it
at
this
point
abreast
*NL*
with
him
.
``
Do
you
mean
a
smell
?
What
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
charming
scent
.
But
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
gave
an
inferential
grunt
.
``
Does
he
live
there
with
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
waited
an
instant
for
more
,
then
resumed
.
``
Has
he
taken
her
*NL*
off
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
he
bring
her
back
?
''
--
Strether
fell
into
the
enquiry
.
But
he
*NL*
wound
it
up
as
before
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
he
wound
it
up
,
accompanied
as
this
was
with
another
drop
back
,
*NL*
another
degustation
of
the
Leoville
,
another
wipe
of
his
moustache
and
*NL*
another
good
word
for
Francois
,
seemed
to
produce
in
his
companion
a
*NL*
slight
irritation
.
``
Then
what
the
devil
DO
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
almost
gaily
,
``
I
guess
I
do
n't
know
anything
!
''
*NL*
His
gaiety
might
have
been
a
tribute
to
the
fact
that
the
state
he
had
*NL*
been
reduced
to
did
for
him
again
what
had
been
done
by
his
talk
of
the
*NL*
matter
with
Miss
Gostrey
at
the
London
theatre
.
It
was
somehow
*NL*
enlarging
;
and
the
air
of
that
amplitude
was
now
doubtless
more
or
*NL*
less
--
and
all
for
Waymarsh
to
feel
--
in
his
further
response
.
``
That
's
*NL*
what
I
found
out
from
the
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
you
said
you
found
out
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
that
--
that
I
do
n't
know
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
good
does
that
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
what
I
've
come
to
you
to
help
me
to
*NL*
discover
.
I
mean
anything
about
anything
over
here
.
I
FELT
that
,
up
*NL*
there
.
It
regularly
rose
before
me
in
its
might
.
The
young
man
*NL*
moreover
--
Chad
's
friend
--
as
good
as
told
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
good
as
told
you
you
know
nothing
about
anything
?
''
Waymarsh
*NL*
appeared
to
look
at
some
one
who
might
have
as
good
as
told
HIM
.
``
How
*NL*
old
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
not
thirty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
had
to
take
that
from
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
took
a
good
deal
more
--
since
,
as
I
tell
you
,
I
took
an
invitation
*NL*
to
dejeuner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
GOING
to
that
unholy
meal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
come
with
me
.
He
wants
you
too
,
you
know
.
I
told
him
about
*NL*
you
.
He
gave
me
his
card
,
''
Strether
pursued
,
``
and
his
name
's
rather
*NL*
funny
.
It
's
John
Little
Bilham
,
and
he
says
his
two
surnames
are
,
on
*NL*
account
of
his
being
small
,
inevitably
used
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Waymarsh
asked
with
due
detachment
from
these
details
,
``
what
's
*NL*
he
doing
up
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
account
of
himself
is
that
he
's
`
only
a
little
artist-man
.
'
That
*NL*
seemed
to
me
perfectly
to
describe
him
.
But
he
's
yet
in
the
phase
of
*NL*
study
;
this
,
you
know
,
is
the
great
art-school
--
to
pass
a
certain
*NL*
number
of
years
in
which
he
came
over
.
And
he
's
a
great
friend
of
*NL*
Chad
's
,
and
occupying
Chad
's
rooms
just
now
because
they
're
so
*NL*
pleasant
.
HE
'S
very
pleasant
and
curious
too
,
''
Strether
added
--
``
though
*NL*
he
's
not
from
Boston
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
looked
already
rather
sick
of
him
.
``
Where
is
he
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
,
either
.
But
he
's
`
notoriously
,
'
*NL*
as
he
put
it
himself
,
not
from
Boston
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Waymarsh
moralised
from
dry
depths
,
``
every
one
ca
n't
*NL*
notoriously
be
from
Boston
.
Why
,
''
he
continued
,
``
is
he
curious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
just
for
THAT
--
for
one
thing
!
But
really
,
''
Strether
added
,
*NL*
``
for
everything
.
When
you
meet
him
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
do
n't
want
to
meet
him
,
''
Waymarsh
impatiently
growled
.
``
Why
*NL*
do
n't
he
go
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
Well
,
because
he
likes
it
over
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeared
in
particular
more
than
Waymarsh
could
bear
.
``
He
ought
*NL*
then
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
,
and
,
as
you
admit
that
you
think
so
too
,
*NL*
why
drag
him
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
reply
again
took
time
.
``
Perhaps
I
do
think
so
*NL*
myself
--
though
I
do
n't
quite
yet
admit
it
.
I
'm
not
a
bit
sure
--
it
's
*NL*
again
one
of
the
things
I
want
to
find
out
.
I
liked
him
,
and
CAN
you
*NL*
like
people
--
?
But
no
matter
.
''
He
pulled
himself
up
.
``
There
's
no
*NL*
doubt
I
want
you
to
come
down
on
me
and
squash
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
helped
himself
to
the
next
course
,
which
,
however
proving
not
*NL*
the
dish
he
had
just
noted
as
supplied
to
the
English
ladies
,
had
the
*NL*
effect
of
causing
his
imagination
temporarily
to
wander
.
But
it
*NL*
presently
broke
out
at
a
softer
spot
.
``
Have
they
got
a
handsome
place
*NL*
up
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
a
charming
place
;
full
of
beautiful
and
valuable
things
.
I
never
*NL*
saw
such
a
place
''
--
and
Strether
's
thought
went
back
to
it
.
``
For
a
*NL*
little
artist-man
--
!
''
He
could
in
fact
scarce
express
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
companion
,
who
appeared
now
to
have
a
view
,
insisted
.
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
life
can
hold
nothing
better
.
Besides
,
they
're
things
of
which
*NL*
he
's
in
charge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
he
does
doorkeeper
for
your
precious
pair
?
Can
life
,
''
Waymarsh
*NL*
enquired
,
``
hold
nothing
better
than
THAT
?
''
Then
as
Strether
,
silent
,
*NL*
seemed
even
yet
to
wonder
,
``
Does
n't
he
know
what
SHE
is
?
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
did
n't
ask
him
.
I
could
n't
.
It
was
impossible
.
You
*NL*
would
n't
either
.
Besides
I
did
n't
want
to
.
No
more
would
you
.
''
*NL*
Strether
in
short
explained
it
at
a
stroke
.
``
You
ca
n't
make
out
over
*NL*
here
what
people
do
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
did
you
come
over
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
exactly
to
see
for
myself
--
without
their
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
do
you
want
mine
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
Strether
laughed
,
``
you
're
not
one
of
THEM
!
I
do
know
what
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
,
however
,
this
last
assertion
caused
Waymarsh
again
to
look
at
him
*NL*
hard
--
such
being
the
latter
's
doubt
of
its
implications
--
he
felt
his
*NL*
justification
lame
.
Which
was
still
more
the
case
when
Waymarsh
*NL*
presently
said
:
``
Look
here
,
Strether
.
Quit
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
smiled
with
a
doubt
of
his
own
.
``
Do
you
mean
my
tone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
damn
your
tone
.
I
mean
your
nosing
round
.
Quit
the
whole
job
.
*NL*
Let
them
stew
in
their
juice
.
You
're
being
used
for
a
thing
you
ai
n't
*NL*
fit
for
.
People
do
n't
take
a
fine-tooth
comb
to
groom
a
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
a
fine-tooth
comb
?
''
Strether
laughed
.
``
It
's
something
I
never
*NL*
called
myself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
you
are
,
all
the
same
.
You
ai
n't
so
young
as
you
were
,
but
*NL*
you
've
kept
your
teeth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
acknowledged
his
friend
's
humour
.
``
Take
care
I
do
n't
get
them
into
*NL*
YOU
!
You
'd
like
them
,
my
friends
at
home
,
Waymarsh
,
''
he
declared
;
*NL*
``
you
'd
really
particularly
like
them
.
And
I
know
''
--
it
was
slightly
*NL*
irrelevant
,
but
he
gave
it
sudden
and
singular
force
--
``
I
know
they
'd
*NL*
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
do
n't
work
them
off
on
ME
!
''
Waymarsh
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Strether
still
lingered
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
``
It
's
*NL*
really
quite
as
indispensable
as
I
say
that
Chad
should
be
got
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indispensable
to
whom
?
To
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Strether
presently
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
if
you
get
him
you
also
get
Mrs.
Newsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
faced
it
.
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
do
n't
get
him
you
do
n't
get
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
merciless
,
but
he
continued
not
to
flinch
.
``
I
think
it
*NL*
might
have
some
effect
on
our
personal
understanding
.
Chad
's
of
real
*NL*
importance
--
or
can
easily
become
so
if
he
will
--
to
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
business
is
of
real
importance
to
his
mother
's
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
naturally
want
what
my
future
wife
wants
.
And
the
thing
will
*NL*
be
much
better
if
we
have
our
own
man
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
your
own
man
in
it
,
in
other
words
,
''
Waymarsh
said
,
*NL*
``
you
'll
marry
--
you
personally
--
more
money
.
She
's
already
rich
,
as
I
*NL*
understand
you
,
but
she
'll
be
richer
still
if
the
business
can
be
made
*NL*
to
boom
on
certain
lines
that
you
've
laid
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
laid
them
down
,
''
Strether
promptly
returned
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Newsome
--
who
knew
extraordinarily
well
what
he
was
about
--
laid
them
*NL*
down
ten
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
well
,
Waymarsh
seemed
to
indicate
with
a
shake
of
his
mane
,
THAT
*NL*
did
n't
matter
!
``
You
're
fierce
for
the
boom
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
weighed
a
moment
in
silence
the
justice
of
the
charge
.
``
I
*NL*
can
scarcely
be
called
fierce
,
I
think
,
when
I
so
freely
take
my
chance
*NL*
of
the
possibility
,
the
danger
,
of
being
influenced
in
a
sense
counter
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Newsome
's
own
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
gave
this
proposition
a
long
hard
look
.
``
I
see
.
You
're
*NL*
afraid
yourself
of
being
squared
.
But
you
're
a
humbug
,
''
he
added
,
``
all
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Strether
quickly
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
ask
me
for
protection
--
which
makes
you
very
interesting
;
and
*NL*
then
you
wo
n't
take
it
.
You
say
you
want
to
be
squashed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
not
so
easily
!
Do
n't
you
see
,
''
Strether
demanded
``
where
my
*NL*
interest
,
as
already
shown
you
,
lies
?
It
lies
in
my
not
being
squared
.
*NL*
If
I
'm
squared
where
's
my
marriage
?
If
I
miss
my
errand
I
miss
that
;
*NL*
and
if
I
miss
that
I
miss
everything
--
I
'm
nowhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
--
but
all
relentlessly
--
took
this
in
.
``
What
do
I
care
where
*NL*
you
are
if
you
're
spoiled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
on
it
an
instant
.
``
Thank
you
awfully
,
''
Strether
at
last
*NL*
said
.
``
But
do
n't
you
think
HER
judgement
of
that
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought
to
content
me
?
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
kept
them
again
face
to
face
,
and
the
end
of
this
was
that
Strether
*NL*
again
laughed
.
``
You
do
her
injustice
.
You
really
MUST
know
her
.
*NL*
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
breakfasted
with
Mr.
Bilham
on
the
morrow
,
and
,
as
inconsequently
*NL*
befell
,
with
Waymarsh
massively
of
the
party
.
The
latter
announced
,
at
*NL*
the
eleventh
hour
and
much
to
his
friend
's
surprise
,
that
,
damn
it
,
he
*NL*
would
as
soon
join
him
as
do
anything
else
;
on
which
they
proceeded
*NL*
together
,
strolling
in
a
state
of
detachment
practically
luxurious
for
*NL*
them
to
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
,
a
couple
engaged
that
day
with
the
*NL*
sharp
spell
of
Paris
as
confessedly
,
it
might
have
been
seen
,
as
any
*NL*
couple
among
the
daily
thousands
so
compromised
.
They
walked
,
*NL*
wandered
,
wondered
and
,
a
little
,
lost
themselves
;
Strether
had
n't
had
*NL*
for
years
so
rich
a
consciousness
of
time
--
a
bag
of
gold
into
which
he
*NL*
constantly
dipped
for
a
handful
.
It
was
present
to
him
that
when
the
*NL*
little
business
with
Mr.
Bilham
should
be
over
he
would
still
have
*NL*
shining
hours
to
use
absolutely
as
he
liked
.
There
was
no
great
pulse
*NL*
of
haste
yet
in
this
process
of
saving
Chad
;
nor
was
that
effect
a
bit
*NL*
more
marked
as
he
sat
,
half
an
hour
later
,
with
his
legs
under
Chad
's
*NL*
mahogany
,
with
Mr.
Bilham
on
one
side
,
with
a
friend
of
Mr.
Bilham
's
on
*NL*
the
other
,
with
Waymarsh
stupendously
opposite
,
and
with
the
great
hum
*NL*
of
Paris
coming
up
in
softness
,
vagueness-for
Strether
himself
indeed
*NL*
already
positive
sweetness
--
through
the
sunny
windows
toward
which
,
the
*NL*
day
before
,
his
curiosity
had
raised
its
wings
from
below
.
The
feeling
*NL*
strongest
with
him
at
that
moment
had
borne
fruit
almost
faster
than
he
*NL*
could
taste
it
,
and
Strether
literally
felt
at
the
present
hour
that
*NL*
there
was
a
precipitation
in
his
fate
.
He
had
known
nothing
and
nobody
*NL*
as
he
stood
in
the
street
;
but
had
n't
his
view
now
taken
a
bound
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
every
one
and
of
every
thing
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
he
up
to
,
what
's
he
up
to
?
''
--
something
like
that
was
at
the
*NL*
back
of
his
head
all
the
while
in
respect
to
little
Bilham
;
but
*NL*
meanwhile
,
till
he
should
make
out
,
every
one
and
every
thing
were
as
*NL*
good
as
represented
for
him
by
the
combination
of
his
host
and
the
lady
*NL*
on
his
left
.
The
lady
on
his
left
,
the
lady
thus
promptly
and
*NL*
ingeniously
invited
to
``
meet
''
Mr.
Strether
and
Mr.
Waymarsh
--
it
was
the
*NL*
way
she
herself
expressed
her
case
--
was
a
very
marked
person
,
a
person
*NL*
who
had
much
to
do
with
our
friend
's
asking
himself
if
the
occasion
*NL*
were
n't
in
its
essence
the
most
baited
,
the
most
gilded
of
traps
.
*NL*
Baited
it
could
properly
be
called
when
the
repast
was
of
so
wise
a
*NL*
savour
,
and
gilded
surrounding
objects
seemed
inevitably
to
need
to
be
*NL*
when
Miss
Barrace
--
which
was
the
lady
's
name
--
looked
at
them
with
*NL*
convex
Parisian
eyes
and
through
a
glass
with
a
remarkably
long
*NL*
tortoise-shell
handle
.
Why
Miss
Barrace
,
mature
meagre
erect
and
*NL*
eminently
gay
,
highly
adorned
,
perfectly
familiar
,
freely
*NL*
contradictions
and
reminding
him
of
some
last-century
portrait
of
a
*NL*
clever
head
without
powder
--
why
Miss
Barrace
should
have
been
in
*NL*
particular
the
note
of
a
``
trap
''
Strether
could
n't
on
the
spot
have
*NL*
explained
;
he
blinked
in
the
light
of
a
conviction
that
he
should
know
*NL*
later
on
,
and
know
well
--
as
it
came
over
him
,
for
that
matter
,
with
*NL*
force
,
that
he
should
need
to
.
He
wondered
what
he
was
to
think
*NL*
exactly
of
either
of
his
new
friends
;
since
the
young
man
,
Chad
's
*NL*
intimate
and
deputy
,
had
,
in
thus
constituting
the
scene
,
practised
so
*NL*
much
more
subtly
than
he
had
been
prepared
for
,
and
since
in
especial
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
,
surrounded
clearly
by
every
consideration
,
had
n't
*NL*
scrupled
to
figure
as
a
familiar
object
.
It
was
interesting
to
him
to
*NL*
feel
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
new
measures
,
other
standards
,
a
*NL*
different
scale
of
relations
,
and
that
evidently
here
were
a
happy
pair
*NL*
who
did
n't
think
of
things
at
all
as
he
and
Waymarsh
thought
.
Nothing
*NL*
was
less
to
have
been
calculated
in
the
business
than
that
it
should
*NL*
now
be
for
him
as
if
he
and
Waymarsh
were
comparatively
quite
at
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
was
magnificent
--
this
at
least
was
an
assurance
privately
*NL*
given
him
by
Miss
Barrace
.
``
Oh
your
friend
's
a
type
,
the
grand
old
*NL*
American
--
what
shall
one
call
it
?
The
Hebrew
prophet
,
Ezekiel
,
*NL*
Jeremiah
,
who
used
when
I
was
a
little
girl
in
the
Rue
Montaigne
to
*NL*
come
to
see
my
father
and
who
was
usually
the
American
Minister
to
the
*NL*
Tuileries
or
some
other
court
.
I
have
n't
seen
one
these
ever
so
many
*NL*
years
;
the
sight
of
it
warms
my
poor
old
chilled
heart
;
this
specimen
*NL*
is
wonderful
;
in
the
right
quarter
,
you
know
,
he
'll
have
a
succes
fou
.
''
*NL*
Strether
had
n't
failed
to
ask
what
the
right
quarter
might
be
,
much
as
*NL*
he
required
his
presence
of
mind
to
meet
such
a
change
in
their
scheme
.
*NL*
``
Oh
the
artist-quarter
and
that
kind
of
thing
;
HERE
already
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
as
you
see
.
''
He
had
been
on
the
point
of
echoing
*NL*
''
`
Here
'
?
--
is
THIS
the
artist-quarter
?
''
but
she
had
already
disposed
of
*NL*
the
question
with
a
wave
of
all
her
tortoise-shell
and
an
easy
``
Bring
*NL*
him
to
ME
!
''
He
knew
on
the
spot
how
little
he
should
be
able
to
bring
*NL*
him
,
for
the
very
air
was
by
this
time
,
to
his
sense
,
thick
and
hot
*NL*
with
poor
Waymarsh
's
judgement
of
it
.
He
was
in
the
trap
still
more
*NL*
than
his
companion
and
,
unlike
his
companion
,
not
making
the
best
of
*NL*
it
;
which
was
precisely
what
doubtless
gave
him
his
admirable
sombre
*NL*
glow
.
Little
did
Miss
Barrace
know
that
what
was
behind
it
was
his
*NL*
grave
estimate
of
her
own
laxity
.
The
general
assumption
with
which
our
*NL*
two
friends
had
arrived
had
been
that
of
finding
Mr.
Bilham
ready
to
*NL*
conduct
them
to
one
or
other
of
those
resorts
of
the
earnest
,
the
*NL*
aesthetic
fraternity
which
were
shown
among
the
sights
of
Paris
.
In
*NL*
this
character
it
would
have
justified
them
in
a
proper
insistence
on
*NL*
discharging
their
score
.
Waymarsh
's
only
proviso
at
the
last
had
been
*NL*
that
nobody
should
pay
for
him
;
but
he
found
himself
,
as
the
occasion
*NL*
developed
,
paid
for
on
a
scale
as
to
which
Strether
privately
made
out
*NL*
that
he
already
nursed
retribution
.
Strether
was
conscious
across
the
*NL*
table
of
what
worked
in
him
,
conscious
when
they
passed
back
to
the
*NL*
small
salon
to
which
,
the
previous
evening
,
he
himself
had
made
so
rich
*NL*
a
reference
;
conscious
most
of
all
as
they
stepped
out
to
the
balcony
*NL*
in
which
one
would
have
had
to
be
an
ogre
not
to
recognise
the
perfect
*NL*
place
for
easy
aftertastes
.
These
things
were
enhanced
for
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
by
a
succession
of
excellent
cigarettes
--
acknowledged
,
*NL*
acclaimed
,
as
a
part
of
the
wonderful
supply
left
behind
him
by
*NL*
Chad
--
in
an
almost
equal
absorption
of
which
Strether
found
himself
*NL*
blindly
,
almost
wildly
pushing
forward
.
He
might
perish
by
the
sword
*NL*
as
well
as
by
famine
,
and
he
knew
that
his
having
abetted
the
lady
by
*NL*
an
excess
that
was
rare
with
him
would
count
for
little
in
the
sum
--
as
*NL*
Waymarsh
might
so
easily
add
it
up
--
of
her
licence
.
Waymarsh
had
*NL*
smoked
of
old
,
smoked
hugely
;
but
Waymarsh
did
nothing
now
,
and
that
*NL*
gave
him
his
advantage
over
people
who
took
things
up
lightly
just
when
*NL*
others
had
laid
them
heavily
down
.
Strether
had
never
smoked
,
and
he
*NL*
felt
as
if
he
flaunted
at
his
friend
that
this
had
been
only
because
of
*NL*
a
reason
.
The
reason
,
it
now
began
to
appear
even
to
himself
,
was
that
*NL*
he
had
never
had
a
lady
to
smoke
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
lady
's
being
there
at
all
,
however
,
that
was
the
strange
*NL*
free
thing
;
perhaps
,
since
she
WAS
there
,
her
smoking
was
the
least
of
*NL*
her
freedoms
.
If
Strether
had
been
sure
at
each
juncture
of
what
--
with
*NL*
Bilham
in
especial
--
she
talked
about
,
he
might
have
traced
others
and
*NL*
winced
at
them
and
felt
Waymarsh
wince
;
but
he
was
in
fact
so
often
at
*NL*
sea
that
his
sense
of
the
range
of
reference
was
merely
general
and
*NL*
that
he
on
several
different
occasions
guessed
and
interpreted
only
to
*NL*
doubt
.
He
wondered
what
they
meant
,
but
there
were
things
he
scarce
*NL*
thought
they
could
be
supposed
to
mean
,
and
``
Oh
no
--
not
THAT
!
''
was
at
*NL*
the
end
of
most
of
his
ventures
.
This
was
the
very
beginning
with
him
*NL*
of
a
condition
as
to
which
,
later
on
,
it
will
be
seen
,
he
found
cause
*NL*
to
pull
himself
up
;
and
he
was
to
remember
the
moment
duly
as
the
first
*NL*
step
in
a
process
.
The
central
fact
of
the
place
was
neither
more
nor
*NL*
less
,
when
analysed
--
and
a
pressure
superficial
sufficed
--
than
the
*NL*
fundamental
impropriety
of
Chad
's
situation
,
round
about
which
they
*NL*
thus
seemed
cynically
clustered
.
Accordingly
,
since
they
took
it
for
*NL*
granted
,
they
took
for
granted
all
that
was
in
connexion
with
it
taken
*NL*
for
granted
at
Woollett
--
matters
as
to
which
,
verily
,
he
had
been
*NL*
reduced
with
Mrs.
Newsome
to
the
last
intensity
of
silence
.
That
was
*NL*
the
consequence
of
their
being
too
bad
to
be
talked
about
,
and
was
the
*NL*
accompaniment
,
by
the
same
token
,
of
a
deep
conception
of
their
*NL*
badness
.
It
befell
therefore
that
when
poor
Strether
put
it
to
himself
*NL*
that
their
badness
was
ultimately
,
or
perhaps
even
insolently
,
what
*NL*
such
a
scene
as
the
one
before
him
was
,
so
to
speak
,
built
upon
,
he
*NL*
could
scarce
shirk
the
dilemma
of
reading
a
roundabout
echo
of
them
*NL*
into
almost
anything
that
came
up
.
This
,
he
was
well
aware
,
was
a
*NL*
dreadful
necessity
;
but
such
was
the
stern
logic
,
he
could
only
gather
,
*NL*
of
a
relation
to
the
irregular
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
way
the
irregular
life
sat
upon
Bilham
and
Miss
Barrace
that
*NL*
was
the
insidious
,
the
delicate
marvel
.
He
was
eager
to
concede
that
*NL*
their
relation
to
it
was
all
indirect
,
for
anything
else
in
him
would
*NL*
have
shown
the
grossness
of
bad
manners
;
but
the
indirectness
was
none
*NL*
the
less
consonant
--
THAT
was
striking-with
a
grateful
enjoyment
of
*NL*
everything
that
was
Chad
's
.
They
spoke
of
him
repeatedly
,
invoking
his
*NL*
good
name
and
good
nature
,
and
the
worst
confusion
of
mind
for
Strether
*NL*
was
that
all
their
mention
of
him
was
of
a
kind
to
do
him
honour
.
They
*NL*
commended
his
munificence
and
approved
his
taste
,
and
in
doing
so
sat
*NL*
down
,
as
it
seemed
to
Strether
,
in
the
very
soil
out
of
which
these
*NL*
things
flowered
.
Our
friend
's
final
predicament
was
that
he
himself
*NL*
was
sitting
down
,
for
the
time
,
WITH
them
,
and
there
was
a
supreme
*NL*
moment
at
which
,
compared
with
his
collapse
,
Waymarsh
's
erectness
*NL*
affected
him
as
really
high
.
One
thing
was
certain
--
he
saw
he
must
*NL*
make
up
his
mind
.
He
must
approach
Chad
,
must
wait
for
him
,
deal
with
*NL*
him
,
master
him
,
but
he
must
n't
dispossess
himself
of
the
faculty
of
*NL*
seeing
things
as
they
were
.
He
must
bring
him
to
HIM
--
not
go
himself
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
so
much
of
the
way
.
He
must
at
any
rate
be
clearer
as
to
*NL*
what
--
should
he
continue
to
do
that
for
convenience
--
he
was
still
*NL*
condoning
.
It
was
on
the
detail
of
this
quantity
--
and
what
could
the
*NL*
fact
be
but
mystifying
?
-
that
Bilham
and
Miss
Barrace
threw
so
little
*NL*
light
.
So
there
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Gostrey
arrived
,
at
the
end
of
a
week
,
she
made
him
a
sign
;
*NL*
he
went
immediately
to
see
her
,
and
it
was
n't
till
then
that
he
could
*NL*
again
close
his
grasp
on
the
idea
of
a
corrective
.
This
idea
however
*NL*
was
luckily
all
before
him
again
from
the
moment
he
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
little
entresol
of
the
Quartier
Marboeuf
into
which
*NL*
she
had
gathered
,
as
she
said
,
picking
them
up
in
a
thousand
flights
*NL*
and
funny
little
passionate
pounces
,
the
makings
of
a
final
nest
.
He
*NL*
recognised
in
an
instant
that
there
really
,
there
only
,
he
should
find
*NL*
the
boon
with
the
vision
of
which
he
had
first
mounted
Chad
's
stairs
.
*NL*
He
might
have
been
a
little
scared
at
the
picture
of
how
much
more
,
in
*NL*
this
place
,
he
should
know
himself
``
in
''
had
n't
his
friend
been
on
the
*NL*
spot
to
measure
the
amount
to
his
appetite
.
Her
compact
and
crowded
*NL*
little
chambers
,
almost
dusky
,
as
they
at
first
struck
him
,
with
*NL*
accumulations
,
represented
a
supreme
general
adjustment
to
*NL*
opportunities
and
conditions
.
Wherever
he
looked
he
saw
an
old
ivory
*NL*
or
an
old
brocade
,
and
he
scarce
knew
where
to
sit
for
fear
of
a
*NL*
misappliance
.
The
life
of
the
occupant
struck
him
of
a
sudden
as
more
*NL*
charged
with
possession
even
than
Chad
's
or
than
Miss
Barrace
's
;
wide
*NL*
as
his
glimpse
had
lately
become
of
the
empire
of
``
things
,
''
what
was
*NL*
before
him
still
enlarged
it
;
the
lust
of
the
eyes
and
the
pride
of
*NL*
life
had
indeed
thus
their
temple
.
It
was
the
innermost
nook
of
the
*NL*
shrine
--
as
brown
as
a
pirate
's
cave
.
In
the
brownness
were
glints
of
*NL*
gold
;
patches
of
purple
were
in
the
gloom
;
objects
all
that
caught
,
*NL*
through
the
muslin
,
with
their
high
rarity
,
the
light
of
the
low
*NL*
windows
.
Nothing
was
clear
about
them
but
that
they
were
precious
,
and
*NL*
they
brushed
his
ignorance
with
their
contempt
as
a
flower
,
in
a
*NL*
liberty
taken
with
him
,
might
have
been
whisked
under
his
nose
.
But
*NL*
after
a
full
look
at
his
hostess
he
knew
none
the
less
what
most
*NL*
concerned
him
.
The
circle
in
which
they
stood
together
was
warm
with
*NL*
life
,
and
every
question
between
them
would
live
there
as
nowhere
else
.
*NL*
A
question
came
up
as
soon
as
they
had
spoken
,
for
his
answer
,
with
a
*NL*
laugh
,
was
quickly
:
``
Well
,
they
've
got
hold
of
me
!
''
Much
of
their
*NL*
talk
on
this
first
occasion
was
his
development
of
that
truth
.
He
was
*NL*
extraordinarily
glad
to
see
her
,
expressing
to
her
frankly
what
she
*NL*
most
showed
him
,
that
one
might
live
for
years
without
a
blessing
*NL*
unsuspected
,
but
that
to
know
it
at
last
for
no
more
than
three
days
*NL*
was
to
need
it
or
miss
it
for
ever
.
She
was
the
blessing
that
had
now
*NL*
become
his
need
,
and
what
could
prove
it
better
than
that
without
her
*NL*
he
had
lost
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
she
asked
with
an
absence
of
alarm
that
,
correcting
*NL*
him
as
if
he
had
mistaken
the
``
period
''
of
one
of
her
pieces
,
gave
him
*NL*
afresh
a
sense
of
her
easy
movement
through
the
maze
he
had
but
begun
*NL*
to
tread
.
``
What
in
the
name
of
all
the
Pococks
have
you
managed
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
exactly
the
wrong
thing
.
I
've
made
a
frantic
friend
of
little
*NL*
Bilham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
sort
of
thing
was
of
the
essence
of
your
case
and
to
have
been
*NL*
allowed
for
from
the
first
.
''
And
it
was
only
after
this
that
,
quite
as
*NL*
a
minor
matter
,
she
asked
who
in
the
world
little
Bilham
might
be
.
When
*NL*
she
learned
that
he
was
a
friend
of
Chad
's
and
living
for
the
time
in
*NL*
Chad
's
rooms
in
Chad
's
absence
,
quite
as
if
acting
in
Chad
's
spirit
and
*NL*
serving
Chad
's
cause
,
she
showed
,
however
,
more
interest
.
``
Should
you
*NL*
mind
my
seeing
him
?
Only
once
,
you
know
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
the
oftener
the
better
:
he
's
amusing
--
he
's
original
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
shock
you
?
''
Miss
Gostrey
threw
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
in
the
world
!
We
escape
that
with
a
perfection
--
!
I
feel
it
to
*NL*
be
largely
,
no
doubt
,
because
I
do
n't
half-understand
him
;
but
our
*NL*
modus
vivendi
is
n't
spoiled
even
by
that
.
You
must
dine
with
me
to
*NL*
meet
him
,
''
Strether
went
on
.
``
Then
you
'll
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
giving
dinners
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
there
I
am
.
That
's
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
kindness
wondered
.
``
That
you
're
spending
too
much
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
no
--
they
seem
to
cost
so
little
.
But
that
I
do
it
to
THEM
.
I
*NL*
ought
to
hold
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
again
--
she
laughed
.
``
The
money
you
must
be
spending
to
*NL*
think
it
cheap
!
But
I
must
be
out
of
it
--
to
the
naked
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
she
were
really
failing
him
.
``
Then
you
*NL*
wo
n't
meet
them
?
''
It
was
almost
as
if
she
had
developed
an
unexpected
*NL*
personal
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
Who
are
they
--
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
little
Bilham
to
begin
with
.
''
He
kept
back
for
the
moment
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
.
``
And
Chad
--
when
he
comes
--
you
must
absolutely
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
then
does
he
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Bilham
has
had
time
to
write
him
,
and
hear
from
him
about
me
.
*NL*
Bilham
,
however
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
will
report
favourably
--
favourably
for
*NL*
Chad
.
That
will
make
him
not
afraid
to
come
.
I
want
you
the
more
*NL*
therefore
,
you
see
,
for
my
bluff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
'll
do
yourself
for
your
bluff
.
''
She
was
perfectly
easy
.
``
At
*NL*
the
rate
you
've
gone
I
'm
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
I
have
n't
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
made
one
protest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
it
over
.
``
Have
n't
you
been
seeing
what
there
's
to
protest
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
her
,
with
this
,
however
ruefully
,
have
the
whole
truth
.
``
I
*NL*
have
n't
yet
found
a
single
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
any
one
WITH
him
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
sort
I
came
out
about
?
''
Strether
took
a
moment
.
``
How
do
I
*NL*
know
?
And
what
do
I
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
oh
!
''
--
and
her
laughter
spread
.
He
was
struck
in
fact
by
the
effect
*NL*
on
her
of
his
joke
.
He
saw
now
how
he
meant
it
as
a
joke
.
SHE
saw
,
*NL*
however
,
still
other
things
,
though
in
an
instant
she
had
hidden
them
.
*NL*
``
You
've
got
at
no
facts
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
muster
them
.
``
Well
,
he
has
a
lovely
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
,
in
Paris
,
''
she
quickly
returned
,
``
proves
nothing
.
That
is
*NL*
rather
it
DISproves
nothing
.
They
may
very
well
,
you
see
,

people
*NL*
your
mission
is
concerned
with
,
have
done
it
FOR
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
And
it
was
on
the
scene
of
their
doings
then
that
Waymarsh
*NL*
and
I
sat
guzzling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
if
you
forbore
to
guzzle
here
on
scenes
of
doings
,
''
she
replied
,
*NL*
``
you
might
easily
die
of
starvation
.
''
With
which
she
smiled
at
him
.
*NL*
``
You
've
worse
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
I
've
EVERYTHING
before
me
.
But
on
our
hypothesis
,
you
know
,
they
*NL*
must
be
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ARE
!
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
.
``
You
're
not
therefore
,
you
see
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
wholly
without
facts
.
They
've
BEEN
,
in
effect
,
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
got
at
something
comparatively
definite
appeared
at
last
a
*NL*
little
to
help
--
a
wave
by
which
moreover
,
the
next
moment
,
recollection
*NL*
was
washed
.
``
My
young
man
does
admit
furthermore
that
they
're
our
*NL*
friend
's
great
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
expression
he
uses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
more
exactly
recalled
.
``
No
--
not
quite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
more
vivid
?
Less
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
bent
,
with
neared
glasses
,
over
a
group
of
articles
on
a
small
*NL*
stand
;
and
at
this
he
came
up
.
``
It
was
a
mere
allusion
,
but
,
on
the
*NL*
lookout
as
I
was
,
it
struck
me
.
`
Awful
,
you
know
,
as
Chad
is
'
--
those
*NL*
were
Bilham
's
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Awful
,
you
know
'
--
?
Oh
!
''
--
and
Miss
Gostrey
turned
them
over
.
She
*NL*
seemed
,
however
,
satisfied
.
``
Well
,
what
more
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
once
more
at
a
bibelot
or
two
,
and
everything
sent
him
back
.
*NL*
``
But
it
is
all
the
same
as
if
they
wished
to
let
me
have
it
between
the
*NL*
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
Quoi
donc
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
what
I
speak
of
.
The
amenity
.
They
can
stun
you
with
that
as
*NL*
well
as
with
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
answered
,
``
you
'll
come
round
!
I
must
see
them
each
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
``
for
myself
.
I
mean
Mr.
Bilham
and
Mr.
Newsome
--
Mr.
Bilham
*NL*
naturally
first
.
Once
only
--
once
for
each
;
that
will
do
.
But
face
to
*NL*
face
--
for
half
an
hour
.
What
's
Mr.
Chad
,
''
she
immediately
pursued
,
*NL*
``
doing
at
Cannes
?
Decent
men
do
n't
go
to
Cannes
with
the
--
well
,
with
*NL*
the
kind
of
ladies
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
they
?
''
Strether
asked
with
an
interest
in
decent
men
that
*NL*
amused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
elsewhere
,
but
not
to
Cannes
.
Cannes
is
different
.
Cannes
is
*NL*
better
.
Cannes
is
best
.
I
mean
it
's
all
people
you
know
--
when
you
do
*NL*
know
them
.
And
if
HE
does
,
why
that
's
different
too
.
He
must
have
*NL*
gone
alone
.
She
ca
n't
be
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
,
''
Strether
confessed
in
his
weakness
,
``
the
least
idea
.
''
*NL*
There
seemed
much
in
what
she
said
,
but
he
was
able
after
a
little
to
*NL*
help
her
to
a
nearer
impression
.
The
meeting
with
little
Bilham
took
*NL*
place
,
by
easy
arrangement
,
in
the
great
gallery
of
the
Louvre
;
and
*NL*
when
,
standing
with
his
fellow
visitor
before
one
of
the
splendid
*NL*
Titians
--
the
overwhelming
portrait
of
the
young
man
with
the
*NL*
strangely-shaped
glove
and
the
blue-grey
eyes
--
he
turned
to
see
the
*NL*
third
member
of
their
party
advance
from
the
end
of
the
waxed
and
*NL*
gilded
vista
,
he
had
a
sense
of
having
at
last
taken
hold
.
He
had
*NL*
agreed
with
Miss
Gostrey
--
it
dated
even
from
Chester
--
for
a
morning
at
*NL*
the
Louvre
,
and
he
had
embraced
independently
the
same
idea
as
thrown
*NL*
out
by
little
Bilham
,
whom
he
had
already
accompanied
to
the
museum
of
*NL*
the
Luxembourg
.
The
fusion
of
these
schemes
presented
no
difficulty
,
*NL*
and
it
was
to
strike
him
again
that
in
little
Bilham
's
company
*NL*
contrarieties
in
general
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
he
's
all
right
--
he
's
one
of
US
!
''
Miss
Gostrey
,
after
the
first
*NL*
exchange
,
soon
found
a
chance
to
murmur
to
her
companion
;
and
Strether
,
*NL*
as
they
proceeded
and
paused
and
while
a
quick
unanimity
between
the
*NL*
two
appeared
to
have
phrased
itself
in
half
a
dozen
remarks
--
Strether
*NL*
knew
that
he
knew
almost
immediately
what
she
meant
,
and
took
it
as
*NL*
still
another
sign
that
he
had
got
his
job
in
hand
.
This
was
the
more
*NL*
grateful
to
him
that
he
could
think
of
the
intelligence
now
serving
him
*NL*
as
an
acquisition
positively
new
.
He
would
n't
have
known
even
the
day
*NL*
before
what
she
meant
--
that
is
if
she
meant
,
what
he
assumed
,
that
they
*NL*
were
intense
Americans
together
.
He
had
just
worked
round
--
and
with
a
*NL*
sharper
turn
of
the
screw
than
any
yet
--
to
the
conception
of
an
*NL*
American
intense
as
little
Bilham
was
intense
.
The
young
man
was
his
*NL*
first
specimen
;
the
specimen
had
profoundly
perplexed
him
;
at
present
*NL*
however
there
was
light
.
It
was
by
little
Bilham
's
amazing
serenity
*NL*
that
he
had
at
first
been
affected
,
but
he
had
inevitably
,
in
his
*NL*
circumspection
,
felt
it
as
the
trail
of
the
serpent
,
the
corruption
,
as
*NL*
he
might
conveniently
have
said
,
of
Europe
;
whereas
the
promptness
with
*NL*
which
it
came
up
for
Miss
Gostrey
but
as
a
special
little
form
of
the
*NL*
oldest
thing
they
knew
justified
it
at
once
to
his
own
vision
as
well
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
be
able
to
like
his
specimen
with
a
clear
good
conscience
,
*NL*
and
this
fully
permitted
it
.
What
had
muddled
him
was
precisely
the
*NL*
small
artist-man
's
way
--
it
was
so
complete
--
of
being
more
American
than
*NL*
anybody
.
But
it
now
for
the
time
put
Strether
vastly
at
his
ease
to
*NL*
have
this
view
of
a
new
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
amiable
youth
then
looked
out
,
as
it
had
first
struck
Strether
,
at
*NL*
a
world
in
respect
to
which
he
had
n't
a
prejudice
.
The
one
our
friend
*NL*
most
instantly
missed
was
the
usual
one
in
favour
of
an
occupation
*NL*
accepted
.
Little
Bilham
had
an
occupation
,
but
it
was
only
an
*NL*
occupation
declined
;
and
it
was
by
his
general
exemption
from
alarm
,
*NL*
anxiety
or
remorse
on
this
score
that
the
impression
of
his
serenity
*NL*
was
made
.
He
had
come
out
to
Paris
to
paint
--
to
fathom
,
that
is
,
at
*NL*
large
,
that
mystery
;
but
study
had
been
fatal
to
him
so
far
as
anything
*NL*
COULD
be
fatal
,
and
his
productive
power
faltered
in
proportion
as
his
*NL*
knowledge
grew
.
Strether
had
gathered
from
him
that
at
the
moment
of
*NL*
his
finding
him
in
Chad
's
rooms
he
had
n't
saved
from
his
shipwreck
a
*NL*
scrap
of
anything
but
his
beautiful
intelligence
and
his
confirmed
*NL*
habit
of
Paris
.
He
referred
to
these
things
with
an
equal
fond
*NL*
familiarity
,
and
it
was
sufficiently
clear
that
,
as
an
outfit
,
they
*NL*
still
served
him
.
They
were
charming
to
Strether
through
the
hour
*NL*
spent
at
the
Louvre
,
where
indeed
they
figured
for
him
as
an
*NL*
unseparated
part
of
the
charged
iridescent
air
,
the
glamour
of
the
*NL*
name
,
the
splendour
of
the
space
,
the
colour
of
the
masters
.
Yet
they
*NL*
were
present
too
wherever
the
young
man
led
,
and
the
day
after
the
*NL*
visit
to
the
Louvre
they
hung
,
in
a
different
walk
,
about
the
steps
of
*NL*
our
party
.
He
had
invited
his
companions
to
cross
the
river
with
him
,
*NL*
offering
to
show
them
his
own
poor
place
;
and
his
own
poor
place
,
which
*NL*
was
very
poor
,
gave
to
his
idiosyncrasies
,
for
Strether
--
the
small
*NL*
sublime
indifference
and
independences
that
had
struck
the
latter
as
*NL*
fresh
--
an
odd
and
engaging
dignity
.
He
lived
at
the
end
of
an
alley
*NL*
that
went
out
of
an
old
short
cobbled
street
,
a
street
that
went
in
*NL*
turn
out
of
a
new
long
smooth
avenue
--
street
and
avenue
and
alley
*NL*
having
,
however
,
in
common
a
sort
of
social
shabbiness
;
and
he
*NL*
introduced
them
to
the
rather
cold
and
blank
little
studio
which
he
had
*NL*
lent
to
a
comrade
for
the
term
of
his
elegant
absence
.
The
comrade
was
*NL*
another
ingenuous
compatriot
,
to
whom
he
had
wired
that
tea
was
to
*NL*
await
them
``
regardless
,
''
and
this
reckless
repast
,
and
the
second
*NL*
ingenuous
compatriot
,
and
the
faraway
makeshift
life
,
with
its
jokes
*NL*
and
its
gaps
,
its
delicate
daubs
and
its
three
or
four
chairs
,
its
*NL*
overflow
of
taste
and
conviction
and
its
lack
of
nearly
all
else
--
these
*NL*
things
wove
round
the
occasion
a
spell
to
which
our
hero
unreservedly
*NL*
surrendered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
the
ingenuous
compatriots
--
for
two
or
three
others
soon
*NL*
gathered
;
he
liked
the
delicate
daubs
and
the
free
*NL*
discriminations
--
involving
references
indeed
,
involving
enthusiasms
and
*NL*
execrations
that
made
him
,
as
they
said
,
sit
up
;
he
liked
above
all
the
*NL*
legend
of
good-humoured
poverty
,
of
mutual
accommodation
fairly
raised
*NL*
to
the
romantic
,
that
he
soon
read
into
the
scene
.
The
ingenuous
*NL*
compatriots
showed
a
candour
,
he
thought
,
surpassing
even
the
candour
*NL*
of
Woollett
;
they
were
red-haired
and
long-legged
,
they
were
quaint
and
*NL*
queer
and
dear
and
droll
;
they
made
the
place
resound
with
the
*NL*
vernacular
,
which
he
had
never
known
so
marked
as
when
figuring
for
the
*NL*
chosen
language
,
he
must
suppose
,
of
contemporary
art
.
They
twanged
*NL*
with
a
vengeance
the
aesthetic
lyre
--
they
drew
from
it
wonderful
airs
.
*NL*
This
aspect
of
their
life
had
an
admirable
innocence
;
and
he
looked
on
*NL*
occasion
at
Maria
Gostrey
to
see
to
what
extent
that
element
reached
*NL*
her
.
She
gave
him
however
for
the
hour
,
as
she
had
given
him
the
*NL*
previous
day
,
no
further
sign
than
to
show
how
she
dealt
with
boys
;
*NL*
meeting
them
with
the
air
of
old
Parisian
practice
that
she
had
for
*NL*
every
one
,
for
everything
,
in
turn
.
Wonderful
about
the
delicate
daubs
,
*NL*
masterful
about
the
way
to
make
tea
,
trustful
about
the
legs
of
chairs
*NL*
and
familiarly
reminiscent
of
those
,
in
the
other
time
,
the
named
,
the
*NL*
numbered
or
the
caricatured
,
who
had
flourished
or
failed
,
disappeared
*NL*
or
arrived
,
she
had
accepted
with
the
best
grace
her
second
course
of
*NL*
little
Bilham
,
and
had
said
to
Strether
,
the
previous
afternoon
on
his
*NL*
leaving
them
,
that
,
since
her
impression
was
to
be
renewed
,
she
would
*NL*
reserve
judgement
till
after
the
new
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
evidence
was
to
come
,
as
it
proved
,
in
a
day
or
two
.
He
soon
*NL*
had
from
Maria
a
message
to
the
effect
that
an
excellent
box
at
the
*NL*
Francais
had
been
lent
her
for
the
following
night
;
it
seeming
on
such
*NL*
occasions
not
the
least
of
her
merits
that
she
was
subject
to
such
*NL*
approaches
.
The
sense
of
how
she
was
always
paying
for
something
in
*NL*
advance
was
equalled
on
Strether
's
part
only
by
the
sense
of
how
she
*NL*
was
always
being
paid
;
all
of
which
made
for
his
consciousness
,
in
the
*NL*
larger
air
,
of
a
lively
bustling
traffic
,
the
exchange
of
such
values
*NL*
as
were
not
for
him
to
handle
.
She
hated
,
he
knew
,
at
the
French
play
,
*NL*
anything
but
a
box
--
just
as
she
hated
at
the
English
anything
but
a
*NL*
stall
;
and
a
box
was
what
he
was
already
in
this
phase
girding
himself
*NL*
to
press
upon
her
.
But
she
had
for
that
matter
her
community
with
*NL*
little
Bilham
:
she
too
always
,
on
the
great
issues
,
showed
as
having
*NL*
known
in
time
.
It
made
her
constantly
beforehand
with
him
and
gave
him
*NL*
mainly
the
chance
to
ask
himself
how
on
the
day
of
their
settlement
*NL*
their
account
would
stand
.
He
endeavoured
even
now
to
keep
it
a
little
*NL*
straight
by
arranging
that
if
he
accepted
her
invitation
she
should
*NL*
dine
with
him
first
;
but
the
upshot
of
this
scruple
was
that
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
on
the
morrow
he
awaited
her
with
Waymarsh
under
the
pillared
*NL*
portico
.
She
had
n't
dined
with
him
,
and
it
was
characteristic
of
their
*NL*
relation
that
she
had
made
him
embrace
her
refusal
without
in
the
least
*NL*
understanding
it
.
She
ever
caused
her
rearrangements
to
affect
him
as
*NL*
her
tenderest
touches
.
It
was
on
that
principle
for
instance
that
,
*NL*
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
be
amiable
again
to
little
Bilham
,
she
*NL*
had
suggested
his
offering
the
young
man
a
seat
in
their
box
.
Strether
*NL*
had
dispatched
for
this
purpose
a
small
blue
missive
to
the
Boulevard
*NL*
Malesherbes
,
but
up
to
the
moment
of
their
passing
into
the
theatre
he
*NL*
had
received
no
response
to
his
message
.
He
held
,
however
,
even
after
*NL*
they
had
been
for
some
time
conveniently
seated
,
that
their
friend
,
who
*NL*
knew
his
way
about
,
would
come
in
at
his
own
right
moment
.
His
*NL*
temporary
absence
moreover
seemed
,
as
never
yet
,
to
make
the
right
*NL*
moment
for
Miss
Gostrey
.
Strether
had
been
waiting
till
tonight
to
get
*NL*
back
from
her
in
some
mirrored
form
her
impressions
and
conclusions
.
*NL*
She
had
elected
,
as
they
said
,
to
see
little
Bilham
once
;
but
now
she
*NL*
had
seen
him
twice
and
had
nevertheless
not
said
more
than
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
meanwhile
sat
opposite
him
with
their
hostess
between
;
and
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
spoke
of
herself
as
an
instructor
of
youth
introducing
her
*NL*
little
charges
to
a
work
that
was
one
of
the
glories
of
literature
.
The
*NL*
glory
was
happily
unobjectionable
,
and
the
little
charges
were
candid
;
*NL*
for
herself
she
had
travelled
that
road
and
she
merely
waited
on
their
*NL*
innocence
.
But
she
referred
in
due
time
to
their
absent
friend
,
whom
*NL*
it
was
clear
they
should
have
to
give
up
.
``
He
either
wo
n't
have
got
*NL*
your
note
,
''
she
said
,
``
or
you
wo
n't
have
got
his
:
he
has
had
some
kind
*NL*
of
hindrance
,
and
,
of
course
,
for
that
matter
,
you
know
,
a
man
never
*NL*
writes
about
coming
to
a
box
.
''
She
spoke
as
if
,
with
her
look
,
it
*NL*
might
have
been
Waymarsh
who
had
written
to
the
youth
,
and
the
latter
's
*NL*
face
showed
a
mixture
of
austerity
and
anguish
.
She
went
on
however
as
*NL*
if
to
meet
this
.
``
He
's
far
and
away
,
you
know
,
the
best
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
of
whom
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
of
all
the
long
procession
--
the
boys
,
the
girls
,
or
the
old
men
*NL*
and
old
women
as
they
sometimes
really
are
;
the
hope
,
as
one
may
say
,
*NL*
of
our
country
.
They
've
all
passed
,
year
after
year
;
but
there
has
*NL*
been
no
one
in
particular
I
've
ever
wanted
to
stop
.
I
feel
--
do
n't
*NL*
YOU
?
--
that
I
want
to
stop
little
Bilham
;
he
's
so
exactly
right
as
he
*NL*
is
.
''
She
continued
to
talk
to
Waymarsh
.
``
He
's
too
delightful
.
If
*NL*
he
'll
only
not
spoil
it
!
But
they
always
WILL
;
they
always
do
;
they
*NL*
always
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
Waymarsh
knows
,
''
Strether
said
after
a
moment
,
``
quite
*NL*
what
it
's
open
to
Bilham
to
spoil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
a
good
American
,
''
Waymarsh
lucidly
enough
replied
;
``
for
it
*NL*
did
n't
strike
me
the
young
man
had
developed
much
in
THAT
shape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
sighed
,
``
the
name
of
the
good
American
is
as
easily
*NL*
given
as
taken
away
!
What
IS
it
,
to
begin
with
,
to
BE
one
,
and
what
's
*NL*
the
extraordinary
hurry
?
Surely
nothing
that
's
so
pressing
was
ever
so
*NL*
little
defined
.
It
's
such
an
order
,
really
,
that
before
we
cook
you
*NL*
the
dish
we
must
at
least
have
your
receipt
.
Besides
the
poor
chicks
*NL*
have
time
!
What
I
've
seen
so
often
spoiled
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
is
the
happy
*NL*
attitude
itself
,
the
state
of
faith
and
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
--
the
*NL*
sense
of
beauty
.
You
're
right
about
him
''
--
she
now
took
in
Strether
;
*NL*
``
little
Bilham
has
them
to
a
charm
,
we
must
keep
little
Bilham
along
.
''
*NL*
Then
she
was
all
again
for
Waymarsh
.
``
The
others
have
all
wanted
so
*NL*
dreadfully
to
do
something
,
and
they
've
gone
and
done
it
in
too
many
*NL*
cases
indeed
.
It
leaves
them
never
the
same
afterwards
;
the
charm
's
*NL*
always
somehow
broken
.
Now
HE
,
I
think
,
you
know
,
really
wo
n't
.
He
*NL*
wo
n't
do
the
least
dreadful
little
thing
.
We
shall
continue
to
enjoy
*NL*
him
just
as
he
is
.
No
--
he
's
quite
beautiful
.
He
sees
everything
.
He
*NL*
is
n't
a
bit
ashamed
.
He
has
every
scrap
of
the
courage
of
it
that
one
*NL*
could
ask
.
Only
think
what
he
MIGHT
do
.
One
wants
really
--
for
fear
of
*NL*
some
accident
--
to
keep
him
in
view
.
At
this
very
moment
perhaps
what
*NL*
may
n't
he
be
up
to
?
I
've
had
my
disappointments
--
the
poor
things
are
*NL*
never
really
safe
;
or
only
at
least
when
you
have
them
under
your
eye
.
*NL*
One
can
never
completely
trust
them
.
One
's
uneasy
,
and
I
think
that
's
*NL*
why
I
most
miss
him
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
wound
up
with
a
laugh
of
enjoyment
over
her
embroidery
of
her
*NL*
idea
--
an
enjoyment
that
her
face
communicated
to
Strether
,
who
almost
*NL*
wished
none
the
less
at
this
moment
that
she
would
let
poor
Waymarsh
*NL*
alone
.
HE
knew
more
or
less
what
she
meant
;
but
the
fact
was
n't
a
*NL*
reason
for
her
not
pretending
to
Waymarsh
that
he
did
n't
.
It
was
*NL*
craven
of
him
perhaps
,
but
he
would
,
for
the
high
amenity
of
the
*NL*
occasion
,
have
liked
Waymarsh
not
to
be
so
sure
of
his
wit
.
Her
*NL*
recognition
of
it
gave
him
away
and
,
before
she
had
done
with
him
or
*NL*
with
that
article
,
would
give
him
worse
.
What
was
he
,
all
the
same
,
to
*NL*
do
?
He
looked
across
the
box
at
his
friend
;
their
eyes
met
;
something
*NL*
queer
and
stiff
,
something
that
bore
on
the
situation
but
that
it
was
*NL*
better
not
to
touch
,
passed
in
silence
between
them
.
Well
,
the
effect
*NL*
of
it
for
Strether
was
an
abrupt
reaction
,
a
final
impatience
of
his
*NL*
own
tendency
to
temporise
.
Where
was
that
taking
him
anyway
?
It
was
*NL*
one
of
the
quiet
instants
that
sometimes
settle
more
matters
than
the
*NL*
outbreaks
dear
to
the
historic
muse
.
The
only
qualification
of
the
*NL*
quietness
was
the
synthetic
``
Oh
hang
it
!
''
into
which
Strether
's
share
*NL*
of
the
silence
soundlessly
flowered
.
It
represented
,
this
mute
*NL*
ejaculation
,
a
final
impulse
to
burn
his
ships
.
These
ships
,
to
the
*NL*
historic
muse
,
may
seem
of
course
mere
cockles
,
but
when
he
presently
*NL*
spoke
to
Miss
Gostrey
it
was
with
the
sense
at
least
of
applying
the
*NL*
torch
.
``
Is
it
then
a
conspiracy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Between
the
two
young
men
?
Well
,
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
a
seer
or
a
*NL*
prophetess
,
''
she
presently
replied
;
``
but
if
I
'm
simply
a
woman
of
sense
*NL*
he
's
working
for
you
to-night
.
I
do
n't
quite
know
how
--
but
it
's
in
my
*NL*
bones
.
''
And
she
looked
at
him
at
last
as
if
,
little
material
as
she
*NL*
yet
gave
him
,
he
'd
really
understand
.
``
For
an
opinion
THAT
'S
my
*NL*
opinion
.
He
makes
you
out
too
well
not
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
work
for
me
to-night
?
''
Strether
wondered
.
``
Then
I
hope
he
*NL*
is
n't
doing
anything
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
you
,
''
she
portentously
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
he
IS
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
you
,
''
she
merely
repeated
.
Though
she
disclaimed
the
*NL*
prophetic
vision
she
was
at
this
instant
the
nearest
approach
he
had
*NL*
ever
met
to
the
priestess
of
the
oracle
.
The
light
was
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
You
must
face
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
faced
it
on
the
spot
.
``
They
HAD
arranged
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
move
in
the
game
.
And
they
've
been
arranging
ever
since
.
He
*NL*
has
had
every
day
his
little
telegram
from
Cannes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
Strether
open
his
eyes
.
``
Do
you
KNOW
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
better
.
I
see
it
.
This
was
,
before
I
met
him
,
what
I
wondered
*NL*
whether
I
WAS
to
see
.
But
as
soon
as
I
met
him
I
ceased
to
wonder
,
and
*NL*
our
second
meeting
made
me
sure
.
I
took
him
all
in
.
He
was
acting
--
he
*NL*
is
still
--
on
his
daily
instructions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
Chad
has
done
the
whole
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
not
the
whole
.
WE
'VE
done
some
of
it
.
You
and
I
and
`
Europe
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Europe
--
yes
,
''
Strether
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
Paris
,
''
she
seemed
to
explain
.
But
there
was
more
,
and
,
with
*NL*
one
of
her
turns
,
she
risked
it
.
``
And
dear
old
Waymarsh
.
You
,
''
she
*NL*
declared
,
``
have
been
a
good
bit
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
massive
.
``
A
good
bit
of
what
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
of
the
wonderful
consciousness
of
our
friend
here
.
You
've
helped
*NL*
too
in
your
way
to
float
him
to
where
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
the
devil
IS
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
it
on
with
a
laugh
.
``
Where
the
devil
,
Strether
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
as
if
he
had
just
been
thinking
it
out
.
``
Well
,
quite
already
*NL*
in
Chad
's
hands
,
it
would
seem
.
''
And
he
had
had
with
this
another
*NL*
thought
.
``
Will
that
be
--
just
all
through
Bilham
--
the
way
he
's
going
to
*NL*
work
it
?
It
would
be
,
for
him
,
you
know
,
an
idea
.
And
Chad
with
an
*NL*
idea
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
she
asked
while
the
image
held
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
Chad
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
monstrous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
as
much
as
you
like
!
But
the
idea
you
speak
of
,
''
she
said
,
``
wo
n't
*NL*
have
been
his
best
.
He
'll
have
a
better
.
It
wo
n't
be
all
through
*NL*
little
Bilham
that
he
'll
work
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
already
sounded
almost
like
a
hope
destroyed
.
``
Through
whom
else
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
we
shall
see
!
''
But
quite
as
she
spoke
she
turned
,
and
*NL*
Strether
turned
;
for
the
door
of
the
box
had
opened
,
with
the
click
of
*NL*
the
ouvreuse
,
from
the
lobby
,
and
a
gentleman
,
a
stranger
to
them
,
had
*NL*
come
in
with
a
quick
step
.
The
door
closed
behind
him
,
and
,
though
*NL*
their
faces
showed
him
his
mistake
,
his
air
,
which
was
striking
,
was
*NL*
all
good
confidence
.
The
curtain
had
just
again
arisen
,
and
,
in
the
*NL*
hush
of
the
general
attention
,
Strether
's
challenge
was
tacit
,
as
was
*NL*
also
the
greeting
,
with
a
quickly
deprecating
hand
and
smile
,
of
the
*NL*
unannounced
visitor
.
He
discreetly
signed
that
he
would
wait
,
would
*NL*
stand
,
and
these
things
and
his
face
,
one
look
from
which
she
had
*NL*
caught
,
had
suddenly
worked
for
Miss
Gostrey
.
She
fitted
to
them
all
*NL*
an
answer
for
Strether
's
last
question
.
The
solid
stranger
was
simply
*NL*
the
answer
--
as
she
now
,
turning
to
her
friend
,
indicated
.
She
brought
*NL*
it
straight
out
for
him
--
it
presented
the
intruder
.
``
Why
,
through
this
*NL*
gentleman
!
''
The
gentleman
indeed
,
at
the
same
time
,
though
sounding
*NL*
for
Strether
a
very
short
name
,
did
practically
as
much
to
explain
.
*NL*
Strether
gasped
the
name
back
--
then
only
had
he
seen
Miss
Gostrey
had
*NL*
said
more
than
she
knew
.
They
were
in
presence
of
Chad
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
was
to
go
over
it
afterwards
again
and
again
--
he
was
going
*NL*
over
it
much
of
the
time
that
they
were
together
,
and
they
were
*NL*
together
constantly
for
three
or
four
days
:
the
note
had
been
so
*NL*
strongly
struck
during
that
first
half-hour
that
everything
happening
*NL*
since
was
comparatively
a
minor
development
.
The
fact
was
that
his
*NL*
perception
of
the
young
man
's
identity
--
so
absolutely
checked
for
a
*NL*
minute
--
had
been
quite
one
of
the
sensations
that
count
in
life
;
he
*NL*
certainly
had
never
known
one
that
had
acted
,
as
he
might
have
said
,
*NL*
with
more
of
a
crowded
rush
.
And
the
rush
though
both
vague
and
*NL*
multitudinous
,
had
lasted
a
long
time
,
protected
,
as
it
were
,
yet
at
*NL*
the
same
time
aggravated
,
by
the
circumstance
of
its
coinciding
with
a
*NL*
stretch
of
decorous
silence
.
They
could
n't
talk
without
disturbing
the
*NL*
spectators
in
the
part
of
the
balcony
just
below
them
;
and
it
,
for
that
*NL*
matter
,
came
to
Strether
--
being
a
thing
of
the
sort
that
did
come
to
*NL*
him
--
that
these
were
the
accidents
of
a
high
civilisation
;
the
imposed
*NL*
tribute
to
propriety
,
the
frequent
exposure
to
conditions
,
usually
*NL*
brilliant
,
in
which
relief
has
to
await
its
time
.
Relief
was
never
*NL*
quite
near
at
hand
for
kings
,
queens
,
comedians
and
other
such
people
,
*NL*
and
though
you
might
be
yourself
not
exactly
one
of
those
,
you
could
*NL*
yet
,
in
leading
the
life
of
high
pressure
,
guess
a
little
how
they
*NL*
sometimes
felt
.
It
was
truly
the
life
of
high
pressure
that
Strether
*NL*
had
seemed
to
feel
himself
lead
while
he
sat
there
,
close
to
Chad
,
*NL*
during
the
long
tension
of
the
act
.
He
was
in
presence
of
a
fact
that
*NL*
occupied
his
whole
mind
,
that
occupied
for
the
half-hour
his
senses
*NL*
themselves
all
together
;
but
he
could
n't
without
inconvenience
show
*NL*
anything
--
which
moreover
might
count
really
as
luck
.
What
he
might
*NL*
have
shown
,
had
he
shown
at
all
,
was
exactly
the
kind
of
emotion
--
the
*NL*
emotion
of
bewilderment
--
that
he
had
proposed
to
himself
from
the
*NL*
first
,
whatever
should
occur
,
to
show
least
.
The
phenomenon
that
had
*NL*
suddenly
sat
down
there
with
him
was
a
phenomenon
of
change
so
complete
*NL*
that
his
imagination
,
which
had
worked
so
beforehand
,
felt
itself
,
in
*NL*
the
connexion
,
without
margin
or
allowance
.
It
had
faced
every
*NL*
contingency
but
that
Chad
should
not
BE
Chad
,
and
this
was
what
it
now
*NL*
had
to
face
with
a
mere
strained
smile
and
an
uncomfortable
flush
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
himself
if
,
by
any
chance
,
before
he
should
have
in
some
way
*NL*
to
commit
himself
,
he
might
feel
his
mind
settled
to
the
new
vision
,
*NL*
might
habituate
it
,
so
to
speak
,
to
the
remarkable
truth
.
But
oh
it
was
*NL*
too
remarkable
,
the
truth
;
for
what
could
be
more
remarkable
than
this
*NL*
sharp
rupture
of
an
identity
?
You
could
deal
with
a
man
as
*NL*
himself
--
you
could
n't
deal
with
him
as
somebody
else
.
It
was
a
small
*NL*
source
of
peace
moreover
to
be
reduced
to
wondering
how
little
he
might
*NL*
know
in
such
an
event
what
a
sum
he
was
setting
you
.
He
could
n't
*NL*
absolutely
not
know
,
for
you
could
n't
absolutely
not
let
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
CASE
then
simply
,
a
strong
case
,
as
people
nowadays
called
such
*NL*
things
,
'
a
case
of
transformation
unsurpassed
,
and
the
hope
was
but
in
*NL*
the
general
law
that
strong
cases
were
liable
to
control
from
without
.
*NL*
Perhaps
he
,
Strether
himself
,
was
the
only
person
after
all
aware
of
*NL*
it
.
Even
Miss
Gostrey
,
with
all
her
science
,
would
n't
be
,
would
*NL*
she
?
--
and
he
had
never
seen
any
one
less
aware
of
anything
than
*NL*
Waymarsh
as
he
glowered
at
Chad
.
The
social
sightlessness
of
his
old
*NL*
friend
's
survey
marked
for
him
afresh
,
and
almost
in
an
humiliating
*NL*
way
,
the
inevitable
limits
of
direct
aid
from
this
source
.
He
was
not
*NL*
certain
,
however
,
of
not
drawing
a
shade
of
compensation
from
the
*NL*
privilege
,
as
yet
untasted
,
of
knowing
more
about
something
in
*NL*
particular
than
Miss
Gostrey
did
.
His
situation
too
was
a
case
,
for
*NL*
that
matter
,
and
he
was
now
so
interested
,
quite
so
privately
agog
,
*NL*
about
it
,
that
he
had
already
an
eye
to
the
fun
it
would
be
to
open
up
*NL*
to
her
afterwards
.
He
derived
during
his
half-hour
no
assistance
from
*NL*
her
,
and
just
this
fact
of
her
not
meeting
his
eyes
played
a
little
,
it
*NL*
must
be
confessed
,
into
his
predicament
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
introduced
Chad
,
in
the
first
minutes
,
under
his
breath
,
and
*NL*
there
was
never
the
primness
in
her
of
the
person
unacquainted
;
but
she
*NL*
had
none
the
less
betrayed
at
first
no
vision
but
of
the
stage
,
where
*NL*
she
occasionally
found
a
pretext
for
an
appreciative
moment
that
she
*NL*
invited
Waymarsh
to
share
.
The
latter
's
faculty
of
participation
had
*NL*
never
had
,
all
round
,
such
an
assault
to
meet
;
the
pressure
on
him
*NL*
being
the
sharper
for
this
chosen
attitude
in
her
,
as
Strether
judged
*NL*
it
,
of
isolating
,
for
their
natural
intercourse
,
Chad
and
himself
.
This
*NL*
intercourse
was
meanwhile
restricted
to
a
frank
friendly
look
from
the
*NL*
young
man
,
something
markedly
like
a
smile
,
but
falling
far
short
of
a
*NL*
grin
,
and
to
the
vivacity
of
Strether
's
private
speculation
as
to
*NL*
whether
HE
carried
himself
like
a
fool
.
He
did
n't
quite
see
how
he
*NL*
could
so
feel
as
one
without
somehow
showing
as
one
.
The
worst
of
that
*NL*
question
moreover
was
that
he
knew
it
as
a
symptom
the
sense
of
which
*NL*
annoyed
him
.
``
If
I
'm
going
to
be
odiously
conscious
of
how
I
may
*NL*
strike
the
fellow
,
''
he
reflected
,
``
it
was
so
little
what
I
came
out
for
*NL*
that
I
may
as
well
stop
before
I
begin
.
''
This
sage
consideration
too
,
*NL*
distinctly
,
seemed
to
leave
untouched
the
fact
that
he
WAS
going
to
be
*NL*
conscious
.
He
was
conscious
of
everything
but
of
what
would
have
*NL*
served
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
to
know
afterwards
,
in
the
watches
of
the
night
,
that
nothing
*NL*
would
have
been
more
open
to
him
than
after
a
minute
or
two
to
propose
*NL*
to
Chad
to
seek
with
him
the
refuge
of
the
lobby
.
He
had
n't
only
not
*NL*
proposed
it
,
but
had
lacked
even
the
presence
of
mind
to
see
it
as
*NL*
possible
.
He
had
stuck
there
like
a
schoolboy
wishing
not
to
miss
a
*NL*
minute
of
the
show
;
though
for
that
portion
of
the
show
then
presented
*NL*
he
had
n't
had
an
instant
's
real
attention
.
He
could
n't
when
the
*NL*
curtain
fell
have
given
the
slightest
account
of
what
had
happened
.
He
*NL*
had
therefore
,
further
,
not
at
that
moment
acknowledged
the
amenity
*NL*
added
by
this
acceptance
of
his
awkwardness
to
Chad
's
general
patience
.
*NL*
Had
n't
he
none
the
less
known
at
the
very
time
--
known
it
stupidly
and
*NL*
without
reaction
--
that
the
boy
was
accepting
something
?
He
was
*NL*
modestly
benevolent
,
the
boy
--
that
was
at
least
what
he
had
been
*NL*
capable
of
the
superiority
of
making
out
his
chance
to
be
;
and
one
had
*NL*
one
's
self
literally
not
had
the
gumption
to
get
in
ahead
of
him
.
If
*NL*
we
should
go
into
all
that
occupied
our
friend
in
the
watches
of
the
*NL*
night
we
should
have
to
mend
our
pen
;
but
an
instance
or
two
may
mark
*NL*
for
us
the
vividness
with
which
he
could
remember
.
He
remembered
the
*NL*
two
absurdities
that
,
if
his
presence
of
mind
HAD
failed
,
were
the
*NL*
things
that
had
had
most
to
do
with
it
.
He
had
never
in
his
life
seen
*NL*
a
young
man
come
into
a
box
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
and
would
,
if
*NL*
challenged
on
the
question
in
advance
,
have
scarce
been
ready
to
*NL*
pronounce
as
to
different
ways
of
doing
so
.
But
it
was
in
spite
of
*NL*
this
definite
to
him
that
Chad
had
had
a
way
that
was
wonderful
:
a
*NL*
fact
carrying
with
it
an
implication
that
,
as
one
might
imagine
it
,
he
*NL*
knew
,
he
had
learned
,
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
already
then
were
abounding
results
;
he
had
on
the
spot
and
*NL*
without
the
least
trouble
of
intention
taught
Strether
that
even
in
so
*NL*
small
a
thing
as
that
there
were
different
ways
.
He
had
done
in
the
*NL*
same
line
still
more
than
this
;
had
by
a
mere
shake
or
two
of
the
head
*NL*
made
his
old
friend
observe
that
the
change
in
him
was
perhaps
more
*NL*
than
anything
else
,
for
the
eye
,
a
matter
of
the
marked
streaks
of
*NL*
grey
,
extraordinary
at
his
age
,
in
his
thick
black
hair
;
as
well
as
*NL*
that
this
new
feature
was
curiously
becoming
to
him
,
did
something
for
*NL*
him
,
as
characterisation
,
also
even
--
of
all
things
in
the
world
--
as
*NL*
refinement
,
that
had
been
a
good
deal
wanted
.
Strether
felt
,
however
,
*NL*
he
would
have
had
to
confess
,
that
it
would
n't
have
been
easy
just
now
,
*NL*
on
this
and
other
counts
,
in
the
presence
of
what
had
been
supplied
,
to
*NL*
be
quite
clear
as
to
what
had
been
missed
.
A
reflexion
a
candid
critic
*NL*
might
have
made
of
old
,
for
instance
,
was
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
happier
for
the
son
to
look
more
like
the
mother
;
but
this
was
a
*NL*
reflexion
that
at
present
would
never
occur
.
The
ground
had
quite
*NL*
fallen
away
from
it
,
yet
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
mother
had
*NL*
supervened
.
It
would
have
been
hard
for
a
young
man
's
face
and
air
to
*NL*
disconnect
themselves
more
completely
than
Chad
's
at
this
juncture
from
*NL*
any
discerned
,
from
any
imaginable
aspect
of
a
New
England
female
*NL*
parent
.
That
of
course
was
no
more
than
had
been
on
the
cards
;
but
it
*NL*
produced
in
Strether
none
the
less
one
of
those
frequent
phenomena
of
*NL*
mental
reference
with
which
all
judgement
in
him
was
actually
beset
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
as
the
days
passed
he
had
had
a
sense
of
the
pertinence
*NL*
of
communicating
quickly
with
Woollett
--
communicating
with
a
quickness
*NL*
with
which
telegraphy
alone
would
rhyme
;
the
fruit
really
of
a
fine
*NL*
fancy
in
him
for
keeping
things
straight
,
for
the
happy
forestalment
of
*NL*
error
.
No
one
could
explain
better
when
needful
,
nor
put
more
*NL*
conscience
into
an
account
or
a
report
;
which
burden
of
conscience
is
*NL*
perhaps
exactly
the
reason
why
his
heart
always
sank
when
the
clouds
of
*NL*
explanation
gathered
.
His
highest
ingenuity
was
in
keeping
the
sky
of
*NL*
life
clear
of
them
.
Whether
or
no
he
had
a
grand
idea
of
the
lucid
,
he
*NL*
held
that
nothing
ever
was
in
fact
--
for
any
one
else
--
explained
.
One
*NL*
went
through
the
vain
motions
,
but
it
was
mostly
a
waste
of
life
.
A
*NL*
personal
relation
was
a
relation
only
so
long
as
people
either
*NL*
perfectly
understood
or
,
better
still
,
did
n't
care
if
they
did
n't
.
From
*NL*
the
moment
they
cared
if
they
did
n't
it
was
living
by
the
sweat
of
*NL*
one
's
brow
;
and
the
sweat
of
one
's
brow
was
just
what
one
might
buy
*NL*
one
's
self
off
from
by
keeping
the
ground
free
of
the
wild
weed
of
*NL*
delusion
.
It
easily
grew
too
fast
,
and
the
Atlantic
cable
now
alone
*NL*
could
race
with
it
.
That
agency
would
each
day
have
testified
for
him
*NL*
to
something
that
was
not
what
Woollett
had
argued
.
He
was
not
at
this
*NL*
moment
absolutely
sure
that
the
effect
of
the
morrow
's
--
or
rather
of
*NL*
the
night
's
--
appreciation
of
the
crisis
would
n't
be
to
determine
some
*NL*
brief
missive
.
``
Have
at
last
seen
him
,
but
oh
dear
!
''
--
some
temporary
*NL*
relief
of
that
sort
seemed
to
hover
before
him
.
It
hovered
somehow
as
*NL*
preparing
them
all
--
yet
preparing
them
for
what
?
If
he
might
do
so
*NL*
more
luminously
and
cheaply
he
would
tick
out
in
four
words
:
``
Awfully
*NL*
old
--
grey
hair
.
''
To
this
particular
item
in
Chad
's
appearance
he
*NL*
constantly
,
during
their
mute
half-hour
,
reverted
;
as
if
so
very
much
*NL*
more
than
he
could
have
said
had
been
involved
in
it
.
The
most
he
*NL*
could
have
said
would
have
been
:
``
If
he
's
going
to
make
me
feel
*NL*
young
--
!
''
which
indeed
,
however
,
carried
with
it
quite
enough
.
If
*NL*
Strether
was
to
feel
young
,
that
is
,
it
would
be
because
Chad
was
to
*NL*
feel
old
;
and
an
aged
and
hoary
sinner
had
been
no
part
of
the
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
of
Chadwick
's
true
time
of
life
was
,
doubtless
,
what
came
*NL*
up
quickest
after
the
adjournment
of
the
two
,
when
the
play
was
over
,
*NL*
to
a
cafe
in
the
Avenue
de
l'Opera
.
Miss
Gostrey
had
in
due
course
*NL*
been
perfect
for
such
a
step
;
she
had
known
exactly
what
they
*NL*
wanted
--
to
go
straight
somewhere
and
talk
;
and
Strether
had
even
felt
*NL*
she
had
known
what
he
wished
to
say
and
that
he
was
arranging
*NL*
immediately
to
begin
.
She
had
n't
pretended
this
,
as
she
HAD
pretended
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
to
have
divined
Waymarsh
's
wish
to
extend
to
her
an
*NL*
independent
protection
homeward
;
but
Strether
nevertheless
found
how
,
*NL*
after
he
had
Chad
opposite
to
him
at
a
small
table
in
the
brilliant
*NL*
halls
that
his
companion
straightway
selected
,
sharply
and
easily
*NL*
discriminated
from
others
,
it
was
quite
,
to
his
mind
,
as
if
she
heard
*NL*
him
speak
;
as
if
,
sitting
up
,
a
mile
away
,
in
the
little
apartment
he
*NL*
knew
,
she
would
listen
hard
enough
to
catch
.
He
found
too
that
he
*NL*
liked
that
idea
,
and
he
wished
that
,
by
the
same
token
,
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
might
have
caught
as
well
.
For
what
had
above
all
been
determined
in
*NL*
him
as
a
necessity
of
the
first
order
was
not
to
lose
another
hour
,
nor
*NL*
a
fraction
of
one
;
was
to
advance
,
to
overwhelm
,
with
a
rush
.
This
was
*NL*
how
he
would
anticipate
--
by
a
night-attack
,
as
might
be
--
any
forced
*NL*
maturity
that
a
crammed
consciousness
of
Paris
was
likely
to
take
upon
*NL*
itself
to
assert
on
behalf
of
the
boy
.
He
knew
to
the
full
,
on
what
he
*NL*
had
just
extracted
from
Miss
Gostrey
,
Chad
's
marks
of
alertness
;
but
*NL*
they
were
a
reason
the
more
for
not
dawdling
.
If
he
was
himself
*NL*
moreover
to
be
treated
as
young
he
would
n't
at
all
events
be
so
treated
*NL*
before
he
should
have
struck
out
at
least
once
.
His
arms
might
be
*NL*
pinioned
afterwards
,
but
it
would
have
been
left
on
record
that
he
was
*NL*
fifty
.
The
importance
of
this
he
had
indeed
begun
to
feel
before
they
*NL*
left
the
theatre
;
it
had
become
a
wild
unrest
,
urging
him
to
seize
his
*NL*
chance
.
He
could
scarcely
wait
for
it
as
they
went
;
he
was
on
the
*NL*
verge
of
the
indecency
of
bringing
up
the
question
in
the
street
;
he
*NL*
fairly
caught
himself
going
on
--
so
he
afterwards
invidiously
named
*NL*
it
--
as
if
there
would
be
for
him
no
second
chance
should
the
present
be
*NL*
lost
.
Not
till
,
on
the
purple
divan
before
the
perfunctory
bock
,
he
*NL*
had
brought
out
the
words
themselves
,
was
he
sure
,
for
that
matter
,
*NL*
that
the
present
would
be
saved
.

''
--
Strether
,
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Chad
after
the
play
,
had
sounded
these
words
almost
breathlessly
,
*NL*
and
with
an
effect
at
first
positively
disconcerting
to
himself
alone
.
*NL*
For
Chad
's
receptive
attitude
was
that
of
a
person
who
had
been
*NL*
gracefully
quiet
while
the
messenger
at
last
reaching
him
has
run
a
*NL*
mile
through
the
dust
.
During
some
seconds
after
he
had
spoken
*NL*
Strether
felt
as
if
HE
had
made
some
such
exertion
;
he
was
not
even
*NL*
certain
that
the
perspiration
was
n't
on
his
brow
.
It
was
the
kind
of
*NL*
consciousness
for
which
he
had
to
thank
the
look
that
,
while
the
strain
*NL*
lasted
,
the
young
man
's
eyes
gave
him
.
They
reflected
--
and
the
deuce
*NL*
of
the
thing
was
that
they
reflected
really
with
a
sort
of
shyness
of
*NL*
kindness
--
his
momentarily
disordered
state
;
which
fact
brought
on
in
*NL*
its
turn
for
our
friend
the
dawn
of
a
fear
that
Chad
might
simply
``
take
*NL*
it
out
''
--
take
everything
out
--
in
being
sorry
for
him
.
Such
a
fear
,
any
*NL*
fear
,
was
unpleasant
.
But
everything
was
unpleasant
;
it
was
odd
how
*NL*
everything
had
suddenly
turned
so
.
This
however
was
no
reason
for
*NL*
letting
the
least
thing
go
.
Strether
had
the
next
minute
proceeded
as
*NL*
roundly
as
if
with
an
advantage
to
follow
up
.
``
Of
course
I
'm
a
*NL*
busybody
,
if
you
want
to
fight
the
case
to
the
death
;
but
after
all
*NL*
mainly
in
the
sense
of
having
known
you
and
having
given
you
such
*NL*
attention
as
you
kindly
permitted
when
you
were
in
jackets
and
*NL*
knickerbockers
.
Yes
--
it
was
knickerbockers
,
I
'm
busybody
enough
to
*NL*
remember
that
;
and
that
you
had
,
for
your
age
--
I
speak
of
the
first
*NL*
far-away
time
--
tremendously
stout
legs
.
Well
,
we
want
you
to
break
.
*NL*
Your
mother
's
heart
's
passionately
set
upon
it
,
but
she
has
above
and
*NL*
beyond
that
excellent
arguments
and
reasons
.
I
've
not
put
them
into
*NL*
her
head
--
I
need
n't
remind
you
how
little
she
's
a
person
who
needs
*NL*
that
.
But
they
exist
--
you
must
take
it
from
me
as
a
friend
both
of
*NL*
hers
and
yours
--
for
myself
as
well
.
I
did
n't
invent
them
,
I
did
n't
*NL*
originally
work
them
out
;
but
I
understand
them
,
I
think
I
can
explain
*NL*
them
--
by
which
I
mean
make
you
actively
do
them
justice
;
and
that
's
why
*NL*
you
see
me
here
.
You
had
better
know
the
worst
at
once
.
It
's
a
*NL*
question
of
an
immediate
rupture
and
an
immediate
return
.
I
've
been
*NL*
conceited
enough
to
dream
I
can
sugar
that
pill
.
I
take
at
any
rate
*NL*
the
greatest
interest
in
the
question
.
I
took
it
already
before
I
left
*NL*
home
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
that
,
altered
as
you
are
,
I
take
it
*NL*
still
more
now
that
I
've
seen
you
.
You
're
older
and
--
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
to
call
it
!
--
more
of
a
handful
;
but
you
're
by
so
much
the
more
,
I
seem
*NL*
to
make
out
,
to
our
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
strike
you
as
improved
?
''
Strether
was
to
recall
that
Chad
had
at
*NL*
this
point
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
likewise
to
recall
--
and
it
had
to
count
for
some
time
as
his
*NL*
greatest
comfort
--
that
it
had
been
``
given
''
him
,
as
they
said
at
*NL*
Woollett
,
to
reply
with
some
presence
of
mind
:
``
I
have
n't
the
least
*NL*
idea
.
''
He
was
really
for
a
while
to
like
thinking
he
had
been
*NL*
positively
hard
.
On
the
point
of
conceding
that
Chad
had
improved
in
*NL*
appearance
,
but
that
to
the
question
of
appearance
the
remark
must
be
*NL*
confined
,
he
checked
even
that
compromise
and
left
his
reservation
*NL*
bare
.
Not
only
his
moral
,
but
also
,
as
it
were
,
his
aesthetic
sense
*NL*
had
a
little
to
pay
for
this
,
Chad
being
unmistakeably
--
and
was
n't
it
a
*NL*
matter
of
the
confounded
grey
hair
again
?
--
handsomer
than
he
had
ever
*NL*
promised
.
That
however
fell
in
perfectly
with
what
Strether
had
said
.
*NL*
They
had
no
desire
to
keep
down
his
proper
expansion
,
and
he
would
n't
*NL*
be
less
to
their
purpose
for
not
looking
,
as
he
had
too
often
done
of
*NL*
old
,
only
bold
and
wild
.
There
was
indeed
a
signal
particular
in
which
*NL*
he
would
distinctly
be
more
so
.
Strether
did
n't
,
as
he
talked
,
*NL*
absolutely
follow
himself
;
he
only
knew
he
was
clutching
his
thread
and
*NL*
that
he
held
it
from
moment
to
moment
a
little
tighter
;
his
mere
*NL*
uninterruptedness
during
the
few
minutes
helped
him
to
do
that
.
He
had
*NL*
frequently
for
a
month
,
turned
over
what
he
should
say
on
this
very
*NL*
occasion
,
and
he
seemed
at
last
to
have
said
nothing
he
had
thought
*NL*
of
--
everything
was
so
totally
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
all
he
had
put
the
flag
at
the
window
.
This
was
what
*NL*
he
had
done
,
and
there
was
a
minute
during
which
he
affected
himself
as
*NL*
having
shaken
it
hard
,
flapped
it
with
a
mighty
flutter
,
straight
in
*NL*
front
of
his
companion
's
nose
.
It
gave
him
really
almost
the
sense
of
*NL*
having
already
acted
his
part
.
The
momentary
relief
--
as
if
from
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
nothing
of
THAT
at
least
could
be
undone
--
sprang
from
a
*NL*
particular
cause
,
the
cause
that
had
flashed
into
operation
,
in
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
's
box
,
with
direct
apprehension
,
with
amazed
recognition
,
and
*NL*
that
had
been
concerned
since
then
in
every
throb
of
his
consciousness
.
*NL*
What
it
came
to
was
that
with
an
absolutely
new
quantity
to
deal
with
*NL*
one
simply
could
n't
know
.
The
new
quantity
was
represented
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
Chad
had
been
made
over
.
That
was
all
;
whatever
it
was
it
was
*NL*
everything
.
Strether
had
never
seen
the
thing
so
done
before
--
it
was
*NL*
perhaps
a
speciality
of
Paris
.
If
one
had
been
present
at
the
process
*NL*
one
might
little
by
little
have
mastered
the
result
;
but
he
was
face
to
*NL*
face
,
as
matters
stood
,
with
the
finished
business
.
It
had
freely
been
*NL*
noted
for
him
that
he
might
be
received
as
a
dog
among
skittles
,
but
*NL*
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
old
quantity
.
He
had
originally
thought
of
*NL*
lines
and
tones
as
things
to
be
taken
,
but
these
possibilities
had
now
*NL*
quite
melted
away
.
There
was
no
computing
at
all
what
the
young
man
*NL*
before
him
would
think
or
feel
or
say
on
any
subject
whatever
.
This
*NL*
intelligence
Strether
had
afterwards
,
to
account
for
his
nervousness
,
*NL*
reconstituted
as
he
might
,
just
as
he
had
also
reconstituted
the
*NL*
promptness
with
which
Chad
had
corrected
his
uncertainty
.
An
*NL*
extraordinarily
short
time
had
been
required
for
the
correction
,
and
*NL*
there
had
ceased
to
be
anything
negative
in
his
companion
's
face
and
*NL*
air
as
soon
as
it
was
made
.
``
Your
engagement
to
my
mother
has
become
*NL*
then
what
they
call
here
a
fait
accompli
?
''
--
it
had
consisted
,
the
*NL*
determinant
touch
,
in
nothing
more
than
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
that
was
enough
,
Strether
had
felt
while
his
answer
hung
fire
.
He
*NL*
had
felt
at
the
same
time
,
however
,
that
nothing
could
less
become
him
*NL*
than
that
it
should
hang
fire
too
long
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
brightly
,
``
it
*NL*
was
on
the
happy
settlement
of
the
question
that
I
started
.
You
see
*NL*
therefore
to
what
tune
I
'm
in
your
family
.
Moreover
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
've
*NL*
been
supposing
you
'd
suppose
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
've
been
supposing
it
for
a
long
time
,
and
what
you
tell
me
helps
*NL*
me
to
understand
that
you
should
want
to
do
something
.
To
do
*NL*
something
,
I
mean
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
to
commemorate
an
event
so
--
what
do
*NL*
they
call
it
?
--
so
auspicious
.
I
see
you
make
out
,
and
not
*NL*
unnaturally
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
bringing
me
home
in
triumph
as
a
sort
*NL*
of
wedding-present
to
Mother
would
commemorate
it
better
than
anything
*NL*
else
.
You
want
to
make
a
bonfire
in
fact
,
''
he
laughed
,
``
and
you
pitch
*NL*
me
on
.
Thank
you
,
thank
you
!
''
he
laughed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
altogether
easy
about
it
,
and
this
made
Strether
now
see
how
at
*NL*
bottom
,
and
in
spite
of
the
shade
of
shyness
that
really
cost
him
*NL*
nothing
,
he
had
from
the
first
moment
been
easy
about
everything
.
The
*NL*
shade
of
shyness
was
mere
good
taste
.
People
with
manners
formed
could
*NL*
apparently
have
,
as
one
of
their
best
cards
,
the
shade
of
shyness
too
.
*NL*
He
had
leaned
a
little
forward
to
speak
;
his
elbows
were
on
the
table
;
*NL*
and
the
inscrutable
new
face
that
he
had
got
somewhere
and
somehow
was
*NL*
brought
by
the
movement
nearer
to
his
critics
There
was
a
fascination
*NL*
for
that
critic
in
its
not
being
,
this
ripe
physiognomy
,
the
face
that
,
*NL*
under
observation
at
least
,
he
had
originally
carried
away
from
*NL*
Woollett
.
Strether
found
a
certain
freedom
on
his
own
side
in
defining
*NL*
it
as
that
of
a
man
of
the
world
--
a
formula
that
indeed
seemed
to
come
*NL*
now
in
some
degree
to
his
relief
;
that
of
a
man
to
whom
things
had
*NL*
happened
and
were
variously
known
.
In
gleams
,
in
glances
,
the
past
did
*NL*
perhaps
peep
out
of
it
;
but
such
lights
were
faint
and
instantly
*NL*
merged
.
Chad
was
brown
and
thick
and
strong
,
and
of
old
Chad
had
been
*NL*
rough
.
Was
all
the
difference
therefore
that
he
was
actually
smooth
?
*NL*
Possibly
;
for
that
he
WAS
smooth
was
as
marked
as
in
the
taste
of
a
*NL*
sauce
or
in
the
rub
of
a
hand
.
The
effect
of
it
was
general
--
it
had
*NL*
retouched
his
features
,
drawn
them
with
a
cleaner
line
.
It
had
cleared
*NL*
his
eyes
and
settled
his
colour
and
polished
his
fine
square
teeth
--
the
*NL*
main
ornament
of
his
face
;
and
at
the
same
time
that
it
had
given
him
a
*NL*
form
and
a
surface
,
almost
a
design
,
it
had
toned
his
voice
,
*NL*
established
his
accent
,
encouraged
his
smile
to
more
play
and
his
other
*NL*
motions
to
less
.
He
had
formerly
,
with
a
great
deal
of
action
,
*NL*
expressed
very
little
;
and
he
now
expressed
whatever
was
necessary
with
*NL*
almost
none
at
all
.
It
was
as
if
in
short
he
had
really
,
copious
*NL*
perhaps
but
shapeless
,
been
put
into
a
firm
mould
and
turned
*NL*
successfully
out
.
The
phenomenon
--
Strether
kept
eyeing
it
as
a
*NL*
phenomenon
,
an
eminent
case
--
was
marked
enough
to
be
touched
by
the
*NL*
finger
.
He
finally
put
his
hand
across
the
table
and
laid
it
on
Chad
's
*NL*
arm
.
``
If
you
'll
promise
me
--
here
on
the
spot
and
giving
me
your
word
of
*NL*
honour
--
to
break
straight
off
,
you
'll
make
the
future
the
real
right
*NL*
thing
for
all
of
us
alike
.
You
'll
ease
off
the
strain
of
this
decent
*NL*
but
none
the
less
acute
suspense
in
which
I
've
for
so
many
days
been
*NL*
waiting
for
you
,
and
let
me
turn
in
to
rest
.
I
shall
leave
you
with
my
*NL*
blessing
and
go
to
bed
in
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
again
fell
back
at
this
and
,
his
hands
pocketed
,
settled
himself
a
*NL*
little
;
in
which
posture
he
looked
,
though
he
rather
anxiously
smiled
,
*NL*
only
the
more
earnest
.
Then
Strether
seemed
to
see
that
he
was
really
*NL*
nervous
,
and
he
took
that
as
what
he
would
have
called
a
wholesome
*NL*
sign
.
The
only
mark
of
it
hitherto
had
been
his
more
than
once
taking
*NL*
off
and
putting
on
his
wide-brimmed
crush
hat
.
He
had
at
this
moment
*NL*
made
the
motion
again
to
remove
it
,
then
had
only
pushed
it
back
,
so
*NL*
that
it
hung
informally
on
his
strong
young
grizzled
crop
.
It
was
a
*NL*
touch
that
gave
the
note
of
the
familiar
--
the
intimate
and
the
*NL*
belated
--
to
their
quiet
colloquy
;
and
it
was
indeed
by
some
such
*NL*
trivial
aid
that
Strether
became
aware
at
the
same
moment
of
something
*NL*
else
.
The
observation
was
at
any
rate
determined
in
him
by
some
light
*NL*
too
fine
to
distinguish
from
so
many
others
,
but
it
was
none
the
less
*NL*
sharply
determined
.
Chad
looked
unmistakeably
during
these
*NL*
instants
--
well
,
as
Strether
put
it
to
himself
,
all
he
was
worth
.
Our
*NL*
friend
had
a
sudden
apprehension
of
what
that
would
on
certain
sides
*NL*
be
.
He
saw
him
in
a
flash
as
the
young
man
marked
out
by
women
;
and
for
*NL*
a
concentrated
minute
the
dignity
,
the
comparative
austerity
,
as
he
*NL*
funnily
fancied
it
,
of
this
character
affected
him
almost
with
awe
.
*NL*
There
was
an
experience
on
his
interlocutor
's
part
that
looked
out
at
*NL*
him
from
under
the
displaced
hat
,
and
that
looked
out
moreover
by
a
*NL*
force
of
its
own
,
the
deep
fact
of
its
quantity
and
quality
,
and
not
*NL*
through
Chad
's
intending
bravado
or
swagger
.
That
was
then
the
way
men
*NL*
marked
out
by
women
WERE
--
and
also
the
men
by
whom
the
women
were
*NL*
doubtless
in
turn
sufficiently
distinguished
.
It
affected
Strether
for
*NL*
thirty
seconds
as
a
relevant
truth
,
a
truth
which
,
however
,
the
next
*NL*
minute
,
had
fallen
into
its
relation
.
``
Ca
n't
you
imagine
there
being
*NL*
some
questions
,
''
Chad
asked
,
``
that
a
fellow
--
however
much
impressed
by
*NL*
your
charming
way
of
stating
things
--
would
like
to
put
to
you
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
easily
.
I
'm
here
to
answer
everything
.
I
think
I
can
even
*NL*
tell
you
things
,
of
the
greatest
interest
to
you
,
that
you
wo
n't
know
*NL*
enough
to
ask
me
.
We
'll
take
as
many
days
to
it
as
you
like
.
But
I
*NL*
want
,
''
Strether
wound
up
,
``
to
go
to
bed
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
spoken
in
such
surprise
that
he
was
amused
.
``
Ca
n't
you
*NL*
believe
it
?
--
with
what
you
put
me
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
seemed
to
consider
.
``
Oh
I
have
n't
put
you
through
*NL*
much
--
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
there
's
so
much
more
to
come
?
''
Strether
laughed
.
``
All
*NL*
the
more
reason
then
that
I
should
gird
myself
.
''
And
as
if
to
mark
*NL*
what
he
felt
he
could
by
this
time
count
on
he
was
already
on
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
,
still
seated
,
stayed
him
,
with
a
hand
against
him
,
as
he
passed
*NL*
between
their
table
and
the
next
.
``
Oh
we
shall
get
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
was
,
as
who
should
say
,
everything
Strether
could
have
*NL*
desired
;
and
quite
as
good
the
expression
of
face
with
which
the
*NL*
speaker
had
looked
up
at
him
and
kindly
held
him
.
All
these
things
*NL*
lacked
was
their
not
showing
quite
so
much
as
the
fruit
of
experience
.
*NL*
Yes
,
experience
was
what
Chad
did
play
on
him
,
if
he
did
n't
play
any
*NL*
grossness
of
defiance
.
Of
course
experience
was
in
a
manner
defiance
;
*NL*
but
it
was
n't
,
at
any
rate
--
rather
indeed
quite
the
*NL*
contrary
!
--
grossness
;
which
was
so
much
gained
.
He
fairly
grew
older
,
*NL*
Strether
thought
,
while
he
himself
so
reasoned
.
Then
with
his
mature
*NL*
pat
of
his
visitor
's
arm
he
also
got
up
;
and
there
had
been
enough
of
*NL*
it
all
by
this
time
to
make
the
visitor
feel
that
something
WAS
*NL*
settled
.
Was
n't
it
settled
that
he
had
at
least
the
testimony
of
*NL*
Chad
's
own
belief
in
a
settlement
?
Strether
found
himself
treating
*NL*
Chad
's
profession
that
they
would
get
on
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
*NL*
going
to
bed
.
He
had
n't
nevertheless
after
this
gone
to
bed
directly
;
*NL*
for
when
they
had
again
passed
out
together
into
the
mild
bright
night
*NL*
a
check
had
virtually
sprung
from
nothing
more
than
a
small
*NL*
circumstance
which
might
have
acted
only
as
confirming
quiescence
.
*NL*
There
were
people
,
expressive
sound
,
projected
light
,
still
abroad
,
and
*NL*
after
they
had
taken
in
for
a
moment
,
through
everything
,
the
great
*NL*
clear
architectural
street
,
they
turned
off
in
tacit
union
to
the
*NL*
quarter
of
Strether
's
hotel
.
``
Of
course
,
''
Chad
here
abruptly
began
,
*NL*
``
of
course
Mother
's
making
things
out
with
you
about
me
has
been
*NL*
natural
--
and
of
course
also
you
've
had
a
good
deal
to
go
upon
.
Still
,
*NL*
you
must
have
filled
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stopped
,
leaving
his
friend
to
wonder
a
little
what
point
he
*NL*
wished
to
make
;
and
this
it
was
that
enabled
Strether
meanwhile
to
make
*NL*
one
.
``
Oh
we
've
never
pretended
to
go
into
detail
.
We
were
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
bound
to
THAT
.
It
was
`
filling
out
'
enough
to
miss
you
as
we
*NL*
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Chad
rather
oddly
insisted
,
though
under
the
high
lamp
at
their
*NL*
corner
,
where
they
paused
,
he
had
at
first
looked
as
if
touched
by
*NL*
Strether
's
allusion
to
the
long
sense
,
at
home
,
of
his
absence
.
``
What
*NL*
I
mean
is
you
must
have
imagined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagined
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
horrors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
affected
Strether
:
horrors
were
so
little
--
superficially
at
*NL*
least
--
in
this
robust
and
reasoning
image
.
But
he
was
none
the
less
*NL*
there
to
be
veracious
.
``
Yes
,
I
dare
say
we
HAVE
imagined
horrors
.
But
*NL*
where
's
the
harm
if
we
have
n't
been
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
raised
his
face
to
the
lamp
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
moments
at
*NL*
which
he
had
,
in
his
extraordinary
way
,
most
his
air
of
designedly
*NL*
showing
himself
.
It
was
as
if
at
these
instants
he
just
presented
*NL*
himself
,
his
identity
so
rounded
off
,
his
palpable
presence
and
his
*NL*
massive
young
manhood
,
as
such
a
link
in
the
chain
as
might
practically
*NL*
amount
to
a
kind
of
demonstration
.
It
was
as
if
--
and
how
but
*NL*
anomalously
?
--
he
could
n't
after
all
help
thinking
sufficiently
well
of
*NL*
these
things
to
let
them
go
for
what
they
were
worth
.
What
could
there
*NL*
be
in
this
for
Strether
but
the
hint
of
some
self-respect
,
some
sense
*NL*
of
power
,
oddly
perverted
;
something
latent
and
beyond
access
,
ominous
*NL*
and
perhaps
enviable
?
The
intimation
had
the
next
thing
,
in
a
flash
,
*NL*
taken
on
a
name
--
a
name
on
which
our
friend
seized
as
he
asked
himself
*NL*
if
he
were
n't
perhaps
really
dealing
with
an
irreducible
young
Pagan
.
*NL*
This
description
--
he
quite
jumped
at
it
--
had
a
sound
that
gratified
his
*NL*
mental
ear
,
so
that
of
a
sudden
he
had
already
adopted
it
.
Pagan
--
yes
,
*NL*
that
was
,
was
n't
it
?
what
Chad
WOULD
logically
be
.
It
was
what
he
*NL*
must
be
.
It
was
what
he
was
.
The
idea
was
a
clue
and
,
instead
of
*NL*
darkening
the
prospect
,
projected
a
certain
clearness
.
Strether
made
*NL*
out
in
this
quick
ray
that
a
Pagan
was
perhaps
,
at
the
pass
they
had
*NL*
come
to
,
the
thing
most
wanted
at
Woollett
.
They
'd
be
able
to
do
with
*NL*
one
--
a
good
one
;
he
'd
find
an
opening
--
yes
;
and
Strether
's
imagination
*NL*
even
now
prefigured
and
accompanied
the
first
appearance
there
of
the
*NL*
rousing
personage
.
He
had
only
the
slight
discomfort
of
feeling
,
as
the
*NL*
young
man
turned
away
from
the
lamp
,
that
his
thought
had
in
the
*NL*
momentary
silence
possibly
been
guessed
.
``
Well
,
I
've
no
doubt
,
''
said
*NL*
Chad
,
``
you
've
come
near
enough
.
The
details
,
as
you
say
,
do
n't
matter
.
*NL*
It
HAS
been
generally
the
case
that
I
've
let
myself
go
.
But
I
'm
coming
*NL*
round
--
I
'm
not
so
bad
now
.
''
With
which
they
walked
on
again
to
*NL*
Strether
's
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
,
''
the
latter
asked
as
they
approached
the
door
,
``
that
*NL*
there
is
n't
any
woman
with
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
pray
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
it
's
the
whole
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
my
going
home
?
''
Chad
was
clearly
surprised
.
``
Oh
not
much
!
Do
you
*NL*
think
that
when
I
want
to
go
any
one
will
have
any
power
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
keep
you
''
--
Strether
took
him
straight
up
--
``
from
carrying
out
your
*NL*
wish
?
Well
,
our
idea
has
been
that
somebody
has
hitherto
--
or
a
good
*NL*
many
persons
perhaps
--
kept
you
pretty
well
from
`
wanting
.
'
That
's
*NL*
what
--
if
you
're
in
anybody
's
hands
--
may
again
happen
.
You
do
n't
answer
*NL*
my
question
''
--
he
kept
it
up
;
``
but
if
you
are
n't
in
anybody
's
hands
so
*NL*
much
the
better
.
There
's
nothing
then
but
what
makes
for
your
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
turned
this
over
.
``
I
do
n't
answer
your
question
?
''
He
spoke
quite
*NL*
without
resenting
it
.
``
Well
,
such
questions
have
always
a
rather
*NL*
exaggerated
side
.
One
does
n't
know
quite
what
you
mean
by
being
in
*NL*
women
's
`
hands
.
'
It
's
all
so
vague
.
One
is
when
one
is
n't
.
One
is
n't
*NL*
when
one
is
.
And
then
one
ca
n't
quite
give
people
away
.
''
He
seemed
*NL*
kindly
to
explain
.
``
I
've
NEVER
got
stuck
--
so
very
hard
;
and
,
as
*NL*
against
anything
at
any
time
really
better
,
I
do
n't
think
I
've
ever
*NL*
been
afraid
.
''
There
was
something
in
it
that
held
Strether
to
wonder
,
*NL*
and
this
gave
him
time
to
go
on
.
He
broke
out
as
with
a
more
helpful
*NL*
thought
.
``
Do
n't
you
know
how
I
like
Paris
itself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
upshot
was
indeed
to
make
our
friend
marvel
.
``
Oh
if
THAT
'S
all
*NL*
that
's
the
matter
with
you
--
!
''
It
was
HE
who
almost
showed
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
's
smile
of
a
truth
more
than
met
it
.
``
But
is
n't
that
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
,
but
it
came
out
.
``
Not
enough
for
your
mother
!
''
*NL*
Spoken
,
however
,
it
sounded
a
trifle
odd
--
the
effect
of
which
was
that
*NL*
Chad
broke
into
a
laugh
.
Strether
,
at
this
,
succumbed
as
well
,
though
*NL*
with
extreme
brevity
.
``
Permit
us
to
have
still
our
theory
.
But
if
you
*NL*
ARE
so
free
and
so
strong
you
're
inexcusable
.
I
'll
write
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
''
he
added
with
decision
.
``
I
'll
say
I
've
got
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeared
to
open
for
Chad
a
new
interest
.
``
How
often
do
you
*NL*
write
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
perpetually
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at
great
length
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
become
a
little
impatient
.
``
I
hope
it
's
not
found
too
*NL*
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
'm
sure
not
.
And
you
hear
as
often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Strether
paused
.
``
As
often
as
I
deserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
writes
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
a
lovely
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
before
the
closed
porte-cochere
,
fixed
him
a
moment
.
``
It
's
*NL*
more
,
my
boy
,
than
YOU
do
!
But
our
suppositions
do
n't
matter
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
if
you
're
actually
not
entangled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
's
pride
seemed
none
the
less
a
little
touched
.
``
I
never
WAS
*NL*
that
--
let
me
insist
.
I
always
had
my
own
way
.
''
With
which
he
pursued
:
*NL*
``
And
I
have
it
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
are
you
here
for
?
What
has
kept
you
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
if
*NL*
you
HAVE
been
able
to
leave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
Chad
,
after
a
stare
,
throw
himself
back
.
``
Do
you
think
one
's
*NL*
kept
only
by
women
?
''
His
surprise
and
his
verbal
emphasis
rang
out
so
*NL*
clear
in
the
still
street
that
Strether
winced
till
he
remembered
the
*NL*
safety
of
their
English
speech
.
``
Is
that
,
''
the
young
man
demanded
,
*NL*
``
what
they
think
at
Woollett
?
''
At
the
good
faith
in
the
question
*NL*
Strether
had
changed
colour
,
feeling
that
,
as
he
would
have
said
,
he
*NL*
had
put
his
foot
in
it
.
He
had
appeared
stupidly
to
misrepresent
what
*NL*
they
thought
at
Woollett
;
but
before
he
had
time
to
rectify
Chad
again
*NL*
was
upon
him
.
``
I
must
say
then
you
show
a
low
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
fell
in
,
unhappily
for
Strether
,
with
that
reflexion
of
his
own
*NL*
prompted
in
him
by
the
pleasant
air
of
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
,
that
*NL*
its
disconcerting
force
was
rather
unfairly
great
.
It
was
a
dig
that
,
*NL*
administered
by
himself
--
and
administered
even
to
poor
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
--
was
no
more
than
salutary
;
but
administered
by
Chad
--
and
quite
*NL*
logically
--
it
came
nearer
drawing
blood
.
They
HAD
n't
a
low
mind
--
nor
*NL*
any
approach
to
one
;
yet
incontestably
they
had
worked
,
and
with
a
*NL*
certain
smugness
,
on
a
basis
that
might
be
turned
against
them
.
Chad
*NL*
had
at
any
rate
pulled
his
visitor
up
;
he
had
even
pulled
up
his
*NL*
admirable
mother
;
he
had
absolutely
,
by
a
turn
of
the
wrist
and
a
jerk
*NL*
of
the
far-flung
noose
,
pulled
up
,
in
a
bunch
,
Woollett
browsing
in
its
*NL*
pride
.
There
was
no
doubt
Woollett
HAD
insisted
on
his
coarseness
;
and
*NL*
what
he
at
present
stood
there
for
in
the
sleeping
street
was
,
by
his
*NL*
manner
of
striking
the
other
note
,
to
make
of
such
insistence
a
*NL*
preoccupation
compromising
to
the
insisters
.
It
was
exactly
as
if
they
*NL*
had
imputed
to
him
a
vulgarity
that
he
had
by
a
mere
gesture
caused
to
*NL*
fall
from
him
.
The
devil
of
the
case
was
that
Strether
felt
it
,
by
the
*NL*
same
stroke
,
as
falling
straight
upon
himself
.
He
had
been
wondering
a
*NL*
minute
ago
if
the
boy
were
n't
a
Pagan
,
and
he
found
himself
wondering
*NL*
now
if
he
were
n't
by
chance
a
gentleman
.
It
did
n't
in
the
least
,
on
*NL*
the
spot
,
spring
up
helpfully
for
him
that
a
person
could
n't
at
the
*NL*
same
time
be
both
.
There
was
nothing
at
this
moment
in
the
air
to
*NL*
challenge
the
combination
;
there
was
everything
to
give
it
on
the
*NL*
contrary
something
of
a
flourish
.
It
struck
Strether
into
the
bargain
*NL*
as
doing
something
to
meet
the
most
difficult
of
the
questions
;
though
*NL*
perhaps
indeed
only
by
substituting
another
.
Would
n't
it
be
precisely
*NL*
by
having
learned
to
be
a
gentleman
that
he
had
mastered
the
consequent
*NL*
trick
of
looking
so
well
that
one
could
scarce
speak
to
him
straight
?
*NL*
But
what
in
the
world
was
the
clue
to
such
a
prime
producing
cause
?
*NL*
There
were
too
many
clues
then
that
Strether
still
lacked
,
and
these
*NL*
clues
to
clues
were
among
them
.
What
it
accordingly
amounted
to
for
him
*NL*
was
that
he
had
to
take
full
in
the
face
a
fresh
attribution
of
*NL*
ignorance
.
He
had
grown
used
by
this
time
to
reminders
,
especially
*NL*
from
his
own
lips
,
of
what
he
did
n't
know
;
but
he
had
borne
them
*NL*
because
in
the
first
place
they
were
private
and
because
in
the
second
*NL*
they
practically
conveyed
a
tribute
.
He
did
n't
know
what
was
bad
,
*NL*
and
--
as
others
did
n't
know
how
little
he
knew
it
--
he
could
put
up
with
*NL*
his
state
.
But
if
he
did
n't
know
,
in
so
important
a
particular
,
what
*NL*
was
good
,
Chad
at
least
was
now
aware
he
did
n't
;
and
that
,
for
some
*NL*
reason
,
affected
our
friend
as
curiously
public
.
It
was
in
fact
an
*NL*
exposed
condition
that
the
young
man
left
him
in
long
enough
for
him
to
*NL*
feel
its
chill
--
till
he
saw
fit
,
in
a
word
,
generously
again
to
cover
*NL*
him
.
This
last
was
in
truth
what
Chad
quite
gracefully
did
.
But
he
*NL*
did
it
as
with
a
simple
thought
that
met
the
whole
of
the
case
.
``
Oh
*NL*
I
'm
all
right
!
''
It
was
what
Strether
had
rather
bewilderedly
to
go
to
*NL*
bed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
really
looked
true
moreover
from
the
way
Chad
was
to
behave
after
*NL*
this
.
He
was
full
of
attentions
to
his
mother
's
ambassador
;
in
spite
*NL*
of
which
,
all
the
while
,
the
latter
's
other
relations
rather
remarkably
*NL*
contrived
to
assert
themselves
.
Strether
's
sittings
pen
in
hand
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
up
in
his
own
room
were
broken
,
yet
they
were
richer
;
and
*NL*
they
were
more
than
ever
interspersed
with
the
hours
in
which
he
*NL*
reported
himself
,
in
a
different
fashion
,
but
with
scarce
less
*NL*
earnestness
and
fulness
,
to
Maria
Gostrey
.
Now
that
,
as
he
would
have
*NL*
expressed
it
,
he
had
really
something
to
talk
about
he
found
himself
,
*NL*
in
respect
to
any
oddity
that
might
reside
for
him
in
the
double
*NL*
connexion
,
at
once
more
aware
and
more
indifferent
.
He
had
been
fine
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Newsome
about
his
useful
friend
,
but
it
had
begun
to
haunt
his
*NL*
imagination
that
Chad
,
taking
up
again
for
her
benefit
a
pen
too
long
*NL*
disused
,
might
possibly
be
finer
.
It
would
n't
at
all
do
,
he
saw
,
that
*NL*
anything
should
come
up
for
him
at
Chad
's
hand
but
what
specifically
*NL*
was
to
have
come
;
the
greatest
divergence
from
which
would
be
precisely
*NL*
the
element
of
any
lubrication
of
their
intercourse
by
levity
It
was
*NL*
accordingly
to
forestall
such
an
accident
that
he
frankly
put
before
*NL*
the
young
man
the
several
facts
,
just
as
they
had
occurred
,
of
his
*NL*
funny
alliance
.
He
spoke
of
these
facts
,
pleasantly
and
obligingly
,
as
*NL*
``
the
whole
story
,
''
and
felt
that
he
might
qualify
the
alliance
as
funny
*NL*
if
he
remained
sufficiently
grave
about
it
.
He
flattered
himself
that
*NL*
he
even
exaggerated
the
wild
freedom
of
his
original
encounter
with
the
*NL*
wonderful
lady
;
he
was
scrupulously
definite
about
the
absurd
*NL*
conditions
in
which
they
had
made
acquaintance
--
their
having
picked
*NL*
each
other
up
almost
in
the
street
;
and
he
had
-LRB-
finest
inspiration
of
*NL*
all
!
-RRB-
a
conception
of
carrying
the
war
into
the
enemy
's
country
by
*NL*
showing
surprise
at
the
enemy
's
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
always
had
a
notion
that
this
last
was
the
grand
style
of
*NL*
fighting
;
the
greater
therefore
the
reason
for
it
,
as
he
could
n't
*NL*
remember
that
he
had
ever
before
fought
in
the
grand
style
.
Every
one
,
*NL*
according
to
this
,
knew
Miss
Gostrey
:
how
came
it
Chad
did
n't
know
*NL*
her
?
The
difficulty
,
the
impossibility
,
was
really
to
escape
it
;
*NL*
Strether
put
on
him
,
by
what
he
took
for
granted
,
the
burden
of
proof
*NL*
of
the
contrary
.
This
tone
was
so
far
successful
as
that
Chad
quite
*NL*
appeared
to
recognise
her
as
a
person
whose
fame
had
reached
him
,
but
*NL*
against
his
acquaintance
with
whom
much
mischance
had
worked
.
He
made
*NL*
the
point
at
the
same
time
that
his
social
relations
,
such
as
they
*NL*
could
be
called
,
were
perhaps
not
to
the
extent
Strether
supposed
with
*NL*
the
rising
flood
of
their
compatriots
.
He
hinted
at
his
having
more
*NL*
and
more
given
way
to
a
different
principle
of
selection
;
the
moral
of
*NL*
which
seemed
to
be
that
he
went
about
little
in
the
``
colony
.
''
For
the
*NL*
moment
certainly
he
had
quite
another
interest
.
It
was
deep
,
what
he
*NL*
understood
,
and
Strether
,
for
himself
,
could
only
so
observe
it
.
He
*NL*
could
n't
see
as
yet
how
deep
.
Might
he
not
all
too
soon
!
For
there
was
*NL*
really
too
much
of
their
question
that
Chad
had
already
committed
*NL*
himself
to
liking
.
He
liked
,
to
begin
with
,
his
prospective
*NL*
stepfather
;
which
was
distinctly
what
had
not
been
on
the
cards
.
His
*NL*
hating
him
was
the
untowardness
for
which
Strether
had
been
best
*NL*
prepared
;
he
had
n't
expected
the
boy
's
actual
form
to
give
him
more
to
*NL*
do
than
his
imputed
.
It
gave
him
more
through
suggesting
that
he
must
*NL*
somehow
make
up
to
himself
for
not
being
sure
he
was
sufficiently
*NL*
disagreeable
.
That
had
really
been
present
to
him
as
his
only
way
to
*NL*
be
sure
he
was
sufficiently
thorough
.
The
point
was
that
if
Chad
's
*NL*
tolerance
of
his
thoroughness
were
insincere
,
were
but
the
best
of
*NL*
devices
for
gaining
time
,
it
none
the
less
did
treat
everything
as
*NL*
tacitly
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
seemed
at
the
end
of
ten
days
the
upshot
of
the
abundant
,
the
*NL*
recurrent
talk
through
which
Strether
poured
into
him
all
it
concerned
*NL*
him
to
know
,
put
him
in
full
possession
of
facts
and
figures
.
Never
*NL*
cutting
these
colloquies
short
by
a
minute
,
Chad
behaved
,
looked
and
*NL*
spoke
as
if
he
were
rather
heavily
,
perhaps
even
a
trifle
gloomily
,
but
*NL*
none
the
less
fundamentally
and
comfortably
free
.
He
made
no
crude
*NL*
profession
of
eagerness
to
yield
,
but
he
asked
the
most
intelligent
*NL*
questions
,
probed
,
at
moments
,
abruptly
,
even
deeper
than
his
friend
's
*NL*
layer
of
information
,
justified
by
these
touches
the
native
estimate
of
*NL*
his
latent
stuff
,
and
had
in
every
way
the
air
of
trying
to
live
,
*NL*
reflectively
,
into
the
square
bright
picture
.
He
walked
up
and
down
in
*NL*
front
of
this
production
,
sociably
took
Strether
's
arm
at
the
points
at
*NL*
which
he
stopped
,
surveyed
it
repeatedly
from
the
right
and
from
the
*NL*
left
,
inclined
a
critical
head
to
either
quarter
,
and
,
while
he
puffed
*NL*
a
still
more
critical
cigarette
,
animadverted
to
his
companion
on
this
*NL*
passage
and
that
.
Strether
sought
relief
--
there
were
hours
when
he
*NL*
required
it
--
in
repeating
himself
;
it
was
in
truth
not
to
be
blinked
*NL*
that
Chad
had
a
way
.
The
main
question
as
yet
was
of
what
it
was
a
way
*NL*
TO
.
It
made
vulgar
questions
no
more
easy
;
but
that
was
unimportant
*NL*
when
all
questions
save
those
of
his
own
asking
had
dropped
.
That
he
*NL*
was
free
was
answer
enough
,
and
it
was
n't
quite
ridiculous
that
this
*NL*
freedom
should
end
by
presenting
itself
as
what
was
difficult
to
move
.
*NL*
His
changed
state
,
his
lovely
home
,
his
beautiful
things
,
his
easy
*NL*
talk
,
his
very
appetite
for
Strether
,
insatiable
and
,
when
all
was
*NL*
said
,
flattering
--
what
were
such
marked
matters
all
but
the
notes
of
*NL*
his
freedom
?
He
had
the
effect
of
making
a
sacrifice
of
it
just
in
*NL*
these
handsome
forms
to
his
visitor
;
which
was
mainly
the
reason
the
*NL*
visitor
was
privately
,
for
the
time
,
a
little
out
of
countenance
.
*NL*
Strether
was
at
this
period
again
and
again
thrown
back
on
a
felt
need
*NL*
to
remodel
somehow
his
plan
.
He
fairly
caught
himself
shooting
rueful
*NL*
glances
,
shy
looks
of
pursuit
,
toward
the
embodied
influence
,
the
*NL*
definite
adversary
,
who
had
by
a
stroke
of
her
own
failed
him
and
on
a
*NL*
fond
theory
of
whose
palpable
presence
he
had
,
under
Mrs.
Newsome
's
*NL*
inspiration
,
altogether
proceeded
.
He
had
once
or
twice
,
in
secret
,
*NL*
literally
expressed
the
irritated
wish
that
SHE
would
come
out
and
find
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
n't
quite
yet
force
it
upon
Woollett
that
such
a
career
,
such
a
*NL*
perverted
young
life
,
showed
after
all
a
certain
plausible
side
,
DID
in
*NL*
the
case
before
them
flaunt
something
like
an
impunity
for
the
social
*NL*
man
;
but
he
could
at
least
treat
himself
to
the
statement
that
would
*NL*
prepare
him
for
the
sharpest
echo
.
This
echo
--
as
distinct
over
there
in
*NL*
the
dry
thin
air
as
some
shrill
``
heading
''
above
a
column
of
*NL*
print
--
seemed
to
reach
him
even
as
he
wrote
.
``
He
says
there
's
no
*NL*
woman
,
''
he
could
hear
Mrs.
Newsome
report
,
in
capitals
almost
of
*NL*
newspaper
size
,
to
Mrs.
Pocock
;
and
he
could
focus
in
Mrs.
Pocock
the
*NL*
response
of
the
reader
of
the
journal
.
He
could
see
in
the
younger
*NL*
lady
's
face
the
earnestness
of
her
attention
and
catch
the
full
*NL*
scepticism
of
her
but
slightly
delayed
``
What
is
there
then
?
''
Just
so
*NL*
he
could
again
as
little
miss
the
mother
's
clear
decision
:
``
There
's
*NL*
plenty
of
disposition
,
no
doubt
,
to
pretend
there
is
n't
.
''
Strether
*NL*
had
,
after
posting
his
letter
,
the
whole
scene
out
;
and
it
was
a
scene
*NL*
during
which
,
coming
and
going
,
as
befell
,
he
kept
his
eye
not
least
*NL*
upon
the
daughter
.
He
had
his
fine
sense
of
the
conviction
Mrs.
Pocock
*NL*
would
take
occasion
to
reaffirm
--
a
conviction
bearing
,
as
he
had
from
*NL*
the
first
deeply
divined
it
to
bear
,
on
Mr.
Strether
's
essential
*NL*
inaptitude
.
She
had
looked
him
in
his
conscious
eyes
even
before
he
*NL*
sailed
,
and
that
she
did
n't
believe
HE
would
find
the
woman
had
been
*NL*
written
in
her
book
.
Had
n't
she
at
the
best
but
a
scant
faith
in
*NL*
his
ability
to
find
women
?
It
was
n't
even
as
if
he
had
found
her
*NL*
mother
--
so
much
more
,
to
her
discrimination
,
had
her
mother
performed
*NL*
the
finding
.
Her
mother
had
,
in
a
case
her
private
judgement
of
which
*NL*
remained
educative
of
Mrs.
Pocock
's
critical
sense
,
found
the
man
.
The
*NL*
man
owed
his
unchallenged
state
,
in
general
,
to
the
fact
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
's
discoveries
were
accepted
at
Woollett
;
but
he
knew
in
his
*NL*
bones
,
our
friend
did
,
how
almost
irresistibly
Mrs.
Pocock
would
now
be
*NL*
moved
to
show
what
she
thought
of
his
own
.
Give
HER
a
free
hand
,
would
*NL*
be
the
moral
,
and
the
woman
would
soon
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
impression
of
Miss
Gostrey
after
her
introduction
to
Chad
was
*NL*
meanwhile
an
impression
of
a
person
almost
unnaturally
on
her
guard
.
He
*NL*
struck
himself
as
at
first
unable
to
extract
from
her
what
he
wished
;
*NL*
though
indeed
OF
what
he
wished
at
this
special
juncture
he
would
*NL*
doubtless
have
contrived
to
make
but
a
crude
statement
.
It
sifted
and
*NL*
settled
nothing
to
put
to
her
,
tout
betement
,
as
she
often
said
,
``
Do
*NL*
you
like
him
,
eh
?
''
--
thanks
to
his
feeling
it
actually
the
least
of
his
*NL*
needs
to
heap
up
the
evidence
in
the
young
man
's
favour
.
He
repeatedly
*NL*
knocked
at
her
door
to
let
her
have
it
afresh
that
Chad
's
*NL*
case
--
whatever
else
of
minor
interest
it
might
yield
--
was
first
and
*NL*
foremost
a
miracle
almost
monstrous
.
It
was
the
alteration
of
the
*NL*
entire
man
,
and
was
so
signal
an
instance
that
nothing
else
,
for
the
*NL*
intelligent
observer
,
could
--
COULD
it
?
--
signify
.
``
It
's
a
plot
,
''
he
*NL*
declared
--
``
there
's
more
in
it
than
meets
the
eye
.
''
He
gave
the
rein
to
*NL*
his
fancy
.
``
It
's
a
plant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
fancy
seemed
to
please
her
.
``
Whose
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
party
responsible
is
,
I
suppose
,
the
fate
that
waits
for
*NL*
one
,
the
dark
doom
that
rides
.
What
I
mean
is
that
with
such
elements
*NL*
one
ca
n't
count
.
I
've
but
my
poor
individual
,
my
modest
human
means
.
*NL*
It
is
n't
playing
the
game
to
turn
on
the
uncanny
.
All
one
's
energy
*NL*
goes
to
facing
it
,
to
tracking
it
.
One
wants
,
confound
it
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
see
?
''
he
confessed
with
a
queer
face
--
``
one
wants
to
enjoy
anything
so
*NL*
rare
.
Call
it
then
life
''
--
he
puzzled
it
out
--
``
call
it
poor
dear
old
*NL*
life
simply
that
springs
the
surprise
.
Nothing
alters
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
surprise
is
paralysing
,
or
at
any
rate
engrossing
--
all
,
practically
,
*NL*
hang
it
,
that
one
sees
,
that
one
CAN
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
silences
were
never
barren
,
nor
even
dull
.
``
Is
that
what
you
've
*NL*
written
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tossed
it
off
.
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
another
pause
while
,
across
her
carpets
,
he
had
another
walk
.
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
look
out
you
'll
have
them
straight
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
've
said
he
'll
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
WILL
he
?
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
special
tone
of
it
made
him
,
pulling
up
,
look
at
her
long
.
``
What
's
*NL*
that
but
just
the
question
I
've
spent
treasures
of
patience
and
*NL*
ingenuity
in
giving
you
,
by
the
sight
of
him
--
after
everything
had
led
*NL*
up
--
every
facility
to
answer
?
What
is
it
but
just
the
thing
I
came
*NL*
here
to-day
to
get
out
of
you
?
Will
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
he
wo
n't
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
He
's
not
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
of
it
held
him
.
``
Then
you
've
all
the
while
known
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
nothing
but
what
I
've
seen
;
and
I
wonder
,
''
she
declared
*NL*
with
some
impatience
,
``
that
you
did
n't
see
as
much
.
It
was
enough
to
be
*NL*
with
him
there
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
box
?
Yes
,
''
he
rather
blankly
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
to
feel
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
up
from
her
chair
,
at
this
,
with
a
nearer
approach
than
she
had
*NL*
ever
yet
shown
to
dismay
at
his
dimness
.
She
even
,
fairly
pausing
for
*NL*
it
,
spoke
with
a
shade
of
pity
.
``
Guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
shade
,
fairly
,
that
brought
a
flush
into
his
face
;
so
that
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
as
they
waited
together
,
their
difference
was
between
them
.
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
just
your
hour
with
him
told
you
so
much
of
his
story
?
*NL*
Very
good
;
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
,
on
my
side
,
as
that
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
you
,
or
as
that
I
did
n't
in
some
degree
understand
HIM
.
That
he
has
*NL*
done
what
he
liked
most
is
n't
,
among
any
of
us
,
a
matter
the
least
in
*NL*
dispute
.
There
's
equally
little
question
at
this
time
of
day
of
what
*NL*
it
is
he
does
like
most
.
But
I
'm
not
talking
,
''
he
reasonably
*NL*
explained
,
``
of
any
mere
wretch
he
may
still
pick
up
.
I
'm
talking
of
*NL*
some
person
who
in
his
present
situation
may
have
held
her
own
,
may
*NL*
really
have
counted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
am
!
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
.
But
she
as
quickly
made
*NL*
her
point
.
``
I
thought
you
thought
--
or
that
they
think
at
*NL*
Woollett
--
that
that
's
what
mere
wretches
necessarily
do
.
Mere
wretches
*NL*
necessarily
DO
N'T
!
''
she
declared
with
spirit
.
``
There
must
,
behind
*NL*
every
appearance
to
the
contrary
,
still
be
somebody
--
somebody
who
's
not
*NL*
a
mere
wretch
,
since
we
accept
the
miracle
.
What
else
but
such
a
*NL*
somebody
can
such
a
miracle
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
in
.
``
Because
the
fact
itself
IS
the
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
.
Some
woman
or
other
.
It
's
one
of
the
things
that
HAVE
to
*NL*
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
mean
then
at
least
a
good
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
woman
?
''
She
threw
up
her
arms
with
a
laugh
.
``
I
should
call
*NL*
her
excellent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
does
he
deny
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
thought
a
moment
.
``
Because
she
's
too
good
to
admit
!
Do
n't
*NL*
you
see
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
how
she
accounts
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
clearly
,
more
and
more
,
did
see
;
yet
it
made
him
also
see
*NL*
other
things
.
``
But
is
n't
what
we
want
that
he
shall
account
for
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
does
.
What
you
have
before
you
is
his
way
.
You
must
forgive
*NL*
him
if
it
is
n't
quite
outspoken
.
In
Paris
such
debts
are
tacit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
could
imagine
;
but
still
--
!
``
Even
when
the
woman
's
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
laughed
out
.
``
Yes
,
and
even
when
the
man
is
!
There
's
always
*NL*
a
caution
in
such
cases
,
''
she
more
seriously
explained
--
``
for
what
it
*NL*
may
seem
to
show
.
There
's
nothing
that
's
taken
as
showing
so
much
here
*NL*
as
sudden
unnatural
goodness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
you
're
speaking
now
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
of
people
who
are
NOT
*NL*
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
delight
,
''
she
replied
,
``
in
your
classifications
.
But
do
you
want
*NL*
me
,
''
she
asked
,
``
to
give
you
in
the
matter
,
on
this
ground
,
the
wisest
*NL*
advice
I
'm
capable
of
?
Do
n't
consider
her
,
do
n't
judge
her
at
all
in
*NL*
herself
.
Consider
her
and
judge
her
only
in
Chad

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
courage
at
least
of
his
companion
's
logic
.
``
Because
then
I
*NL*
shall
like
her
?
''
He
almost
looked
,
with
his
quick
imagination
as
if
he
*NL*
already
did
,
though
seeing
at
once
also
the
full
extent
of
how
little
*NL*
it
would
suit
his
book
.
``
But
is
that
what
I
came
out
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
to
confess
indeed
that
it
was
n't
.
But
there
was
something
*NL*
else
.
``
Do
n't
make
up
your
mind

There
are
all
sorts
of
things

You
*NL*
have
n't
seen
him
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
on
his
side
Strether
recognised
;
but
his
acuteness
none
the
less
*NL*
showed
him
the
danger
.
``
Yes
,
but
if
the
more
I
see
the
better
he
*NL*
seems
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
found
something
.
``
That
may
be
--
but
his
disavowal
of
her
*NL*
is
n't
,
all
the
same
,
pure
consideration
.
There
's
a
hitch
.
''
She
made
*NL*
it
out
.
``
It
's
the
effort
to
sink
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
winced
at
the
image
.
``
To
`
sink

--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
mean
there
's
a
struggle
,

a
part
of
it
is
just
what
he
*NL*
hides
.
Take
time
--
that
's
the
only
way
not
to
make
some
mistake
that
*NL*
you
'll
regret
.
Then
you
'll
see
.
He
does
really
want
to
shake
her
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
had
by
this
time
so
got
into
the
vision
that
he
almost
*NL*
gasped
.
``
After
all
she
has
done
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
gave
him
a
look
which
broke
the
next
moment
into
a
*NL*
wonderful
smile
.
``
He
's
not
so
good
as
you
think
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
remained
with
him
,
these
words
,
promising
him
,
in
their
character
*NL*
of
warning
,
considerable
help
;
but
the
support
he
tried
to
draw
from
*NL*
them
found
itself
on
each
renewal
of
contact
with
Chad
defeated
by
*NL*
something
else
.
What
could
it
be
,
this
disconcerting
force
,
he
asked
*NL*
himself
,
but
the
sense
,
constantly
renewed
,
that
Chad
WAS
--
quite
in
*NL*
fact
insisted
on
being
--
as
good
as
he
thought
?
It
seemed
somehow
as
if
*NL*
he
could
n't
BUT
be
as
good
from
the
moment
he
was
n't
as
bad
.
There
was
*NL*
a
succession
of
days
at
all
events
when
contact
with
him
--
and
in
its
*NL*
immediate
effect
,
as
if
it
could
produce
no
other
--
elbowed
out
of
*NL*
Strether
's
consciousness
everything
but
itself
.
Little
Bilham
once
*NL*
more
pervaded
the
scene
,
but
little
Bilham
became
even
in
a
higher
*NL*
degree
than
he
had
originally
been
one
of
the
numerous
forms
of
the
*NL*
inclusive
relation
;
a
consequence
promoted
,
to
our
friend
's
sense
,
by
*NL*
two
or
three
incidents
with
which
we
have
yet
to
make
acquaintance
.
*NL*
Waymarsh
himself
,
for
the
occasion
,
was
drawn
into
the
eddy
;
it
*NL*
absolutely
,
though
but
temporarily
,
swallowed
him
down
,
and
there
were
*NL*
days
when
Strether
seemed
to
bump
against
him
as
a
sinking
swimmer
*NL*
might
brush
a
submarine
object
.
The
fathomless
medium
held
*NL*
them
--
Chad
's
manner
was
the
fathomless
medium
;
and
our
friend
felt
as
*NL*
if
they
passed
each
other
,
in
their
deep
immersion
,
with
the
round
*NL*
impersonal
eye
of
silent
fish
.
It
was
practically
produced
between
*NL*
them
that
Waymarsh
was
giving
him
then
his
chance
;
and
the
shade
of
*NL*
discomfort
that
Strether
drew
from
the
allowance
resembled
not
a
little
*NL*
the
embarrassment
he
had
known
at
school
,
as
a
boy
,
when
members
of
his
*NL*
family
had
been
present
at
exhibitions
.
He
could
perform
before
*NL*
strangers
,
but
relatives
were
fatal
,
and
it
was
now
as
if
,
*NL*
comparatively
,
Waymarsh
were
a
relative
.
He
seemed
to
hear
him
say
*NL*
``
Strike
up
then
!
''
and
to
enjoy
a
foretaste
of
conscientious
domestic
*NL*
criticism
.
He
HAD
struck
up
,
so
far
as
he
actually
could
;
Chad
knew
by
*NL*
this
time
in
profusion
what
he
wanted
;
and
what
vulgar
violence
did
his
*NL*
fellow
pilgrim
expect
of
him
when
he
had
really
emptied
his
mind
?
It
*NL*
went
somehow
to
and
fro
that
what
poor
Waymarsh
meant
was
``
I
told
you
*NL*
so
--
that
you
'd
lose
your
immortal
soul
!
''
but
it
was
also
fairly
*NL*
explicit
that
Strether
had
his
own
challenge
and
that
,
since
they
must
*NL*
go
to
the
bottom
of
things
,
he
wasted
no
more
virtue
in
watching
Chad
*NL*
than
Chad
wasted
in
watching
him
.
His
dip
for
duty
's
sake
--
where
was
*NL*
it
worse
than
Waymarsh
's
own
?
For
HE
need
n't
have
stopped
resisting
*NL*
and
refusing
,
need
n't
have
parleyed
,
at
that
rate
,
with
the
foe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strolls
over
Paris
to
see
something
or
call
somewhere
were
*NL*
accordingly
inevitable
and
natural
,
and
the
late
sessions
in
the
*NL*
wondrous
troisieme
,
the
lovely
home
,
when
men
dropped
in
and
the
*NL*
picture
composed
more
suggestively
through
the
haze
of
tobacco
,
of
*NL*
music
more
or
less
good
and
of
talk
more
or
less
polyglot
,
were
on
a
*NL*
principle
not
to
be
distinguished
from
that
of
the
mornings
and
the
*NL*
afternoons
.
Nothing
,
Strether
had
to
recognise
as
he
leaned
back
and
*NL*
smoked
,
could
well
less
resemble
a
scene
of
violence
than
even
the
*NL*
liveliest
of
these
occasions
.
They
were
occasions
of
discussion
,
none
*NL*
the
less
,
and
Strether
had
never
in
his
life
heard
so
many
opinions
on
*NL*
so
many
subjects
.
There
were
opinions
at
Woollett
,
but
only
on
three
*NL*
or
four
.
The
differences
were
there
to
match
;
if
they
were
doubtless
*NL*
deep
,
though
few
,
they
were
quiet
--
they
were
,
as
might
be
said
,
almost
*NL*
as
shy
as
if
people
had
been
ashamed
of
them
.
People
showed
little
*NL*
diffidence
about
such
things
,
on
the
other
hand
,
in
the
Boulevard
*NL*
Malesherbes
,
and
were
so
far
from
being
ashamed
of
them
--
or
indeed
of
*NL*
anything
else
--
that
they
often
seemed
to
have
invented
them
to
avert
*NL*
those
agreements
that
destroy
the
taste
of
talk
.
No
one
had
ever
done
*NL*
that
at
Woollett
,
though
Strether
could
remember
times
when
he
himself
*NL*
had
been
tempted
to
it
without
quite
knowing
why
.
He
saw
why
at
*NL*
present
--
he
had
but
wanted
to
promote
intercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
however
,
were
but
parenthetic
memories
,
and
the
turn
taken
by
*NL*
his
affair
on
the
whole
was
positively
that
if
his
nerves
were
on
the
*NL*
stretch
it
was
because
he
missed
violence
.
When
he
asked
himself
if
*NL*
none
would
then
,
in
connexion
with
it
,
ever
come
at
all
,
he
might
*NL*
almost
have
passed
as
wondering
how
to
provoke
it
.
It
would
be
too
*NL*
absurd
if
such
a
vision
as
THAT
should
have
to
be
invoked
for
relief
;
*NL*
it
was
already
marked
enough
as
absurd
that
he
should
actually
have
*NL*
begun
with
flutters
and
dignities
on
the
score
of
a
single
accepted
*NL*
meal
.
What
sort
of
a
brute
had
he
expected
Chad
to
be
,
*NL*
anyway
?
--
Strether
had
occasion
to
make
the
enquiry
but
was
careful
to
*NL*
make
it
in
private
.
He
could
himself
,
comparatively
recent
as
it
*NL*
was
--
it
was
truly
but
the
fact
of
a
few
days
since
--
focus
his
primal
*NL*
crudity
;
but
he
would
on
the
approach
of
an
observer
,
as
if
handling
an
*NL*
illicit
possession
,
have
slipped
the
reminiscence
out
of
sight
.
There
*NL*
were
echoes
of
it
still
in
Mrs.
Newsome
's
letters
,
and
there
were
*NL*
moments
when
these
echoes
made
him
exclaim
on
her
want
of
tact
.
He
*NL*
blushed
of
course
,
at
once
,
still
more
for
the
explanation
than
for
the
*NL*
ground
of
it
:
it
came
to
him
in
time
to
save
his
manners
that
she
*NL*
could
n't
at
the
best
become
tactful
as
quickly
as
he
.
Her
tact
had
to
*NL*
reckon
with
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
the
General
Post-Office
and
the
*NL*
extravagant
curve
of
the
globe
.
Chad
had
one
day
offered
tea
at
the
*NL*
Boulevard
Malesherbes
to
a
chosen
few
,
a
group
again
including
the
*NL*
unobscured
Miss
Barrace
;
and
Strether
had
on
coming
out
walked
away
*NL*
with
the
acquaintance
whom
in
his
letters
to
Mrs.
Newsome
he
always
*NL*
spoke
of
as
the
little
artist-man
.
He
had
had
full
occasion
to
mention
*NL*
him
as
the
other
party
,
so
oddly
,
to
the
only
close
personal
alliance
*NL*
observation
had
as
yet
detected
in
Chad
's
existence
.
Little
Bilham
's
*NL*
way
this
afternoon
was
not
Strether
's
,
but
he
had
none
the
less
kindly
*NL*
come
with
him
,
and
it
was
somehow
a
part
of
his
kindness
that
as
it
had
*NL*
sadly
begun
to
rain
they
suddenly
found
themselves
seated
for
*NL*
conversation
at
a
cafe
in
which
they
had
taken
refuge
.
He
had
passed
*NL*
no
more
crowded
hour
in
Chad
's
society
than
the
one
just
ended
;
he
had
*NL*
talked
with
Miss
Barrace
,
who
had
reproached
him
with
not
having
come
*NL*
to
see
her
,
and
he
had
above
all
hit
on
a
happy
thought
for
causing
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
tension
to
relax
.
Something
might
possibly
be
extracted
for
*NL*
the
latter
from
the
idea
of
his
success
with
that
lady
,
whose
quick
*NL*
apprehension
of
what
might
amuse
her
had
given
Strether
a
free
hand
.
*NL*
What
had
she
meant
if
not
to
ask
whether
she
could
n't
help
him
with
his
*NL*
splendid
encumbrance
,
and
might
n't
the
sacred
rage
at
any
rate
be
kept
*NL*
a
little
in
abeyance
by
thus
creating
for
his
comrade
's
mind
even
in
a
*NL*
world
of
irrelevance
the
possibility
of
a
relation
?
What
was
it
but
a
*NL*
relation
to
be
regarded
as
so
decorative
and
,
in
especial
,
on
the
*NL*
strength
of
it
,
to
be
whirled
away
,
amid
flounces
and
feathers
,
in
a
*NL*
coupe
lined
,
by
what
Strether
could
make
out
,
with
dark
blue
brocade
?
*NL*
He
himself
had
never
been
whirled
away
--
never
at
least
in
a
coupe
and
*NL*
behind
a
footman
;
he
had
driven
with
Miss
Gostrey
in
cabs
,
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
,
a
few
times
,
in
an
open
buggy
,
with
Mrs.
Newsome
in
a
*NL*
four-seated
cart
and
,
occasionally
up
at
the
mountains
,
on
a
buckboard
;
*NL*
but
his
friend
's
actual
adventure
transcended
his
personal
experience
.
*NL*
He
now
showed
his
companion
soon
enough
indeed
how
inadequate
,
as
a
*NL*
general
monitor
,
this
last
queer
quantity
could
once
more
feel
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
game
under
the
sun
is
he
playing
?
''
He
signified
the
next
moment
*NL*
that
his
allusion
was
not
to
the
fat
gentleman
immersed
in
dominoes
on
*NL*
whom
his
eyes
had
begun
by
resting
,
but
to
their
host
of
the
previous
*NL*
hour
,
as
to
whom
,
there
on
the
velvet
bench
,
with
a
final
collapse
of
*NL*
all
consistency
,
he
treated
himself
to
the
comfort
of
indiscretion
.
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
see
him
come
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
,
in
meditation
,
looked
at
him
with
a
kindness
almost
*NL*
paternal
.
``
Do
n't
you
like
it
over
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
laughed
out
--
for
the
tone
was
indeed
droll
;
he
let
himself
go
.
*NL*
``
What
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
The
only
thing
I
've
any
business
to
like
*NL*
is
to
feel
that
I
'm
moving
him
.
That
's
why
I
ask
you
whether
you
*NL*
believe
I
AM
?
Is
the
creature
''
--
and
he
did
his
best
to
show
that
he
*NL*
simply
wished
to
ascertain
--
``
honest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
looked
responsible
,
but
looked
it
through
a
small
dim
*NL*
smile
.
``
What
creature
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
this
that
they
did
have
for
a
little
a
mute
interchange
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
untrue
that
he
's
free
?
How
then
,
''
Strether
asked
wondering
``
does
he
*NL*
arrange
his
life
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
creature
you
mean
Chad
himself
?
''
little
Bilham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
here
,
with
a
rising
hope
,
just
thought
,
``
We
must
take
one
of
*NL*
them
at
a
time
.
''
But
his
coherence
lapsed
.
``
IS
there
some
woman
?
Of
*NL*
whom
he
's
really
afraid
of
course
I
mean
--
or
who
does
with
him
what
she
*NL*
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
awfully
charming
of
you
,
''
Bilham
presently
remarked
,
``
not
to
have
*NL*
asked
me
that
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
'm
not
fit
for
my
job
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exclamation
had
escaped
our
friend
,
but
it
made
little
Bilham
more
*NL*
deliberate
.
``
Chad
's
a
rare
case
!
''
he
luminously
observed
.
``
He
's
*NL*
awfully
changed
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
see
it
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
he
has
improved
?
Oh
yes
--
I
think
every
one
must
see
it
.
But
*NL*
I
'm
not
sure
,
''
said
little
Bilham
,
``
that
I
did
n't
like
him
about
as
*NL*
well
in
his
other
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
this
IS
really
a
new
state
altogether
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
the
young
man
after
a
moment
returned
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
he
was
*NL*
really
meant
by
nature
to
be
quite
so
good
.
It
's
like
the
new
edition
*NL*
of
an
old
book
that
one
has
been
fond
of
--
revised
and
amended
,
brought
*NL*
up
to
date
,
but
not
quite
the
thing
one
knew
and
loved
.
However
that
*NL*
may
be
at
all
events
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
I
do
n't
think
,
you
know
,
that
he
's
*NL*
really
playing
,
as
you
call
it
,
any
game
.
I
believe
he
really
wants
to
*NL*
go
back
and
take
up
a
career
.
He
's
capable
of
one
,
you
know
,
that
will
*NL*
improve
and
enlarge
him
still
more
.
He
wo
n't
then
,
''
little
Bilham
*NL*
continued
to
remark
,
``
be
my
pleasant
well-rubbed
old-fashioned
volume
*NL*
at
all
.
But
of
course
I
'm
beastly
immoral
.
I
'm
afraid
it
would
be
a
*NL*
funny
world
altogether
--
a
world
with
things
the
way
I
like
them
.
I
*NL*
ought
,
I
dare
say
,
to
go
home
and
go
into
business
myself
.
Only
I
'd
*NL*
simply
rather
die
--
simply
.
And
I
've
not
the
least
difficulty
in
making
*NL*
up
my
mind
not
to
,
and
in
knowing
exactly
why
,
and
in
defending
my
*NL*
ground
against
all
comers
.
All
the
same
,
''
he
wound
up
,
``
I
assure
you
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
a
word
against
it
--
for
himself
,
I
mean

to
Chad
.
I
seem
to
*NL*
see
it
as
much
the
best
thing
for
him
.
You
see
he
's
not
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
DO
I
?
''
--
Strether
stared
.
``
I
've
been
supposing
I
see
just
the
*NL*
opposite
--
an
extraordinary
case
of
the
equilibrium
arrived
at
and
*NL*
assured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
there
's
a
lot
behind
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
there
you
are
!
''
Strether
exclaimed
.
``
That
's
just
what
I
want
to
*NL*
get
at
.
You
speak
of
your
familiar
volume
altered
out
of
recognition
.
*NL*
Well
,
who
's
the
editor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
looked
before
him
a
minute
in
silence
.
``
He
ought
to
get
*NL*
married
.
THAT
would
do
it
.
And
he
wants
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wants
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
little
Bilham
waited
,
and
,
with
a
sense
that
he
had
information
,
*NL*
Strether
scarce
knew
what
was
coming
.
``
He
wants
to
be
free
.
He
is
n't
*NL*
used
,
you
see
,
''
the
young
man
explained
in
his
lucid
way
,
``
to
being
so
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
Then
I
may
take
it
from
you
that
he
IS
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
matched
his
pause
,
but
making
it
up
with
a
quiet
fulness
.
*NL*
``
DO
take
it
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
why
is
n't
he
free
?
He
swears
to
me
he
is
,
but
meanwhile
*NL*
does
nothing
--
except
of
course
that
he
's
so
kind
to
me
--
to
prove
it
;
*NL*
and
could
n't
really
act
much
otherwise
if
he
were
n't
.
My
question
to
*NL*
you
just
now
was
exactly
on
this
queer
impression
of
his
diplomacy
:
as
*NL*
if
instead
of
really
giving
ground
his
line
were
to
keep
me
on
here
and
*NL*
set
me
a
bad
example
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
half-hour
meanwhile
had
ebbed
Strether
paid
his
score
,
and
the
*NL*
waiter
was
presently
in
the
act
of
counting
out
change
.
Our
friend
*NL*
pushed
back
to
him
a
fraction
of
it
,
with
which
,
after
an
emphatic
*NL*
recognition
,
the
personage
in
question
retreated
.
``
You
give
too
much
,
''
*NL*
little
Bilham
permitted
himself
benevolently
to
observe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
always
give
too
much
!
''
Strether
helplessly
sighed
.
``
But
you
*NL*
do
n't
,
''
he
went
on
as
if
to
get
quickly
away
from
the
contemplation
of
*NL*
that
doom
,
``
answer
my
question
.
Why
is
n't
he
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
had
got
up
as
if
the
transaction
with
the
waiter
had
been
*NL*
a
signal
,
and
had
already
edged
out
between
the
table
and
the
divan
.
*NL*
The
effect
of
this
was
that
a
minute
later
they
had
quitted
the
place
,
*NL*
the
gratified
waiter
alert
again
at
the
open
door
.
Strether
had
found
*NL*
himself
deferring
to
his
companion
's
abruptness
as
to
a
hint
that
he
*NL*
should
be
answered
as
soon
as
they
were
more
isolated
.
This
happened
*NL*
when
after
a
few
steps
in
the
outer
air
they
had
turned
the
next
comer
.
*NL*
There
our
friend
had
kept
it
up
.
``
Why
is
n't
he
free
if
he
's
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
looked
him
full
in
the
face
.
``
Because
it
's
a
virtuous
*NL*
attachment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
settled
the
question
so
effectually
for
the
time
--
that
is
for
*NL*
the
next
few
days
--
that
it
had
given
Strether
almost
a
new
lease
of
*NL*
life
.
It
must
be
added
however
that
,
thanks
to
his
constant
habit
of
*NL*
shaking
the
bottle
in
which
life
handed
him
the
wine
of
experience
,
he
*NL*
presently
found
the
taste
of
the
lees
rising
as
usual
into
his
draught
.
*NL*
His
imagination
had
in
other
words
already
dealt
with
his
young
*NL*
friend
's
assertion
;
of
which
it
had
made
something
that
sufficiently
*NL*
came
out
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
seeing
Maria
Gostrey
.
This
*NL*
occasion
moreover
had
been
determined
promptly
by
a
new
circumstance
--
a
*NL*
circumstance
he
was
the
last
man
to
leave
her
for
a
day
in
ignorance
*NL*
of
.
``
When
I
said
to
him
last
night
,
''
he
immediately
began
,
``
that
*NL*
without
some
definite
word
from
him
now
that
will
enable
me
to
speak
to
*NL*
them
over
there
of
our
sailing
--
or
at
least
of
mine
,
giving
them
some
*NL*
sort
of
date
--
my
responsibility
becomes
uncomfortable
and
my
situation
*NL*
awkward
;
when
I
said
that
to
him
what
do
you
think
was
his
reply
?
''
And
*NL*
then
as
she
this
time
gave
it
up
:
``
Why
that
he
has
two
particular
*NL*
friends
,
two
ladies
,
mother
and
daughter
,
about
to
arrive
in
*NL*
Paris
--
coming
back
from
an
absence
;
and
that
he
wants
me
so
furiously
*NL*
to
meet
them
,
know
them
and
like
them
,
that
I
shall
oblige
him
by
*NL*
kindly
not
bringing
our
business
to
a
crisis
till
he
has
had
a
chance
*NL*
to
see
them
again
himself
.
Is
that
,
''
Strether
enquired
,
``
the
way
he
's
*NL*
going
to
try
to
get
off
?
These
are
the
people
,
''
he
explained
,
``
that
he
*NL*
must
have
gone
down
to
see
before
I
arrived
.
They
're
the
best
friends
*NL*
he
has
in
the
world
,
and
they
take
more
interest
than
any
one
else
in
*NL*
what
concerns
him
.
As
I
'm
his
next
best
he
sees
a
thousand
reasons
why
*NL*
we
should
comfortably
meet
.
He
has
n't
broached
the
question
sooner
*NL*
because
their
return
was
uncertain
--
seemed
in
fact
for
the
present
*NL*
impossible
.
But
he
more
than
intimates
that
--
if
you
can
believe
*NL*
it
--
their
desire
to
make
my
acquaintance
has
had
to
do
with
their
*NL*
surmounting
difficulties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
dying
to
see
you
?
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dying
.
Of
course
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
they
're
the
virtuous
attachment
.
''
*NL*
He
had
already
told
her
about
that
--
had
seen
her
the
day
after
his
talk
*NL*
with
little
Bilham
;
and
they
had
then
threshed
out
together
the
bearing
*NL*
of
the
revelation
.
She
had
helped
him
to
put
into
it
the
logic
in
*NL*
which
little
Bilham
had
left
it
slightly
deficient
Strether
had
n't
*NL*
pressed
him
as
to
the
object
of
the
preference
so
unexpectedly
*NL*
described
;
feeling
in
the
presence
of
it
,
with
one
of
his
irrepressible
*NL*
scruples
,
a
delicacy
from
which
he
had
in
the
quest
of
the
quite
other
*NL*
article
worked
himself
sufficiently
free
.
He
had
held
off
,
as
on
a
*NL*
small
principle
of
pride
,
from
permitting
his
young
friend
to
mention
a
*NL*
name
;
wishing
to
make
with
this
the
great
point
that
Chad
's
virtuous
*NL*
attachments
were
none
of
his
business
.
He
had
wanted
from
the
first
*NL*
not
to
think
too
much
of
his
dignity
,
but
that
was
no
reason
for
not
*NL*
allowing
it
any
little
benefit
that
might
turn
up
.
He
had
often
enough
*NL*
wondered
to
what
degree
his
interference
might
pass
for
interested
;
so
*NL*
that
there
was
no
want
of
luxury
in
letting
it
be
seen
whenever
he
*NL*
could
that
he
did
n't
interfere
.
That
had
of
course
at
the
same
time
*NL*
not
deprived
him
of
the
further
luxury
of
much
private
astonishment
;
*NL*
which
however
he
had
reduced
to
some
order
before
communicating
his
*NL*
knowledge
.
When
he
had
done
this
at
last
it
was
with
the
remark
that
,
*NL*
surprised
as
Miss
Gostrey
might
,
like
himself
,
at
first
be
,
she
would
*NL*
probably
agree
with
him
on
reflexion
that
such
an
account
of
the
matter
*NL*
did
after
all
fit
the
confirmed
appearances
.
Nothing
certainly
,
on
all
*NL*
the
indications
,
could
have
been
a
greater
change
for
him
than
a
*NL*
virtuous
attachment
,
and
since
they
had
been
in
search
of
the
``
word
''
as
*NL*
the
French
called
it
,
of
that
change
,
little
Bilham
's
*NL*
announcement
--
though
so
long
and
so
oddly
delayed
--
would
serve
as
well
*NL*
as
another
.
She
had
assured
Strether
in
fact
after
a
pause
that
the
*NL*
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
it
did
serve
;
and
yet
her
assurance
*NL*
had
n't
so
weighed
with
him
as
that
before
they
parted
he
had
n't
*NL*
ventured
to
challenge
her
sincerity
.
Did
n't
she
believe
the
attachment
*NL*
was
virtuous
?
--
he
had
made
sure
of
her
again
with
the
aid
of
that
*NL*
question
.
The
tidings
he
brought
her
on
this
second
occasion
were
*NL*
moreover
such
as
would
help
him
to
make
surer
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
at
first
none
the
less
as
only
amused
.
``
You
say
there
are
*NL*
two
?
An
attachment
to
them
both
then
would
,
I
suppose
,
almost
*NL*
necessarily
be
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
took
the
point
,
but
he
had
his
clue
.
``
May
n't
he
be
still
in
*NL*
the
stage
of
not
quite
knowing
which
of
them
,
mother
or
daughter
,
he
*NL*
likes
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
it
more
thought
.
``
Oh
it
must
be
the
daughter
--
at
his
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
.
Yet
what
do
we
know
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
about
hers
?
She
may
*NL*
be
old
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
enough
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
to
marry
Chad
.
That
may
be
,
you
know
,
what
they
want
.
And
if
*NL*
Chad
wants
it
too
,
and
little
Bilham
wants
it
,
and
even
we
,
at
a
pinch
,
*NL*
could
do
with
it
--
that
is
if
she
does
n't
prevent
repatriation
--
why
it
*NL*
may
be
plain
sailing
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
always
the
case
for
him
in
these
counsels
that
each
of
his
*NL*
remarks
,
as
it
came
,
seemed
to
drop
into
a
deeper
well
.
He
had
at
all
*NL*
events
to
wait
a
moment
to
hear
the
slight
splash
of
this
one
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
why
if
Mr.
Newsome
wants
to
marry
the
young
lady
he
has
n't
already
*NL*
done
it
or
has
n't
been
prepared
with
some
statement
to
you
about
it
.
*NL*
And
if
he
both
wants
to
marry
her
and
is
on
good
terms
with
them
why
*NL*
is
n't
he
`
free
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
responsively
,
wondered
indeed
.
``
Perhaps
the
girl
herself
*NL*
does
n't
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
does
he
speak
of
them
to
you
as
he
does
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
mind
echoed
the
question
,
but
also
again
met
it
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
it
's
with
the
mother
he
's
on
good
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
against
the
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
she
's
trying
to
persuade
the
daughter
to
consent
to
him
,
what
*NL*
could
make
him
like
the
mother
more
?
Only
,
''
Strether
threw
out
,
``
why
*NL*
should
n't
the
daughter
consent
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
,
``
may
n't
it
be
that
every
one
else
is
n't
quite
*NL*
so
struck
with
him
as
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
regard
him
you
mean
as
such
an
`
eligible
'
young
man
?
Is
that
*NL*
what
I
've
come
to
?
''
he
audibly
and
rather
gravely
sought
to
know
.
*NL*
``
However
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
his
marriage
is
what
his
mother
most
*NL*
desires
--
that
is
if
it
will
help
.
And
ought
n't
ANY
marriage
to
help
?
*NL*
They
must
want
him
''
--
he
had
already
worked
it
out
--
``
to
be
better
off
.
*NL*
Almost
any
girl
he
may
marry
will
have
a
direct
interest
in
his
taking
*NL*
up
his
chances
.
It
wo
n't
suit
HER
at
least
that
he
shall
miss
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
cast
about
.
``
No
--
you
reason
well
!
But
of
course
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
there
's
always
dear
old
Woollett
itself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
he
mused
--
``
there
's
always
dear
old
Woollett
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
a
moment
.
``
The
young
lady
may
n't
find
herself
able
to
*NL*
swallow
THAT
quantity
.
She
may
think
it
's
paying
too
much
;
she
may
*NL*
weigh
one
thing
against
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
ever
restless
in
such
debates
,
took
a
vague
turn
``
It
will
all
*NL*
depend
on
who
she
is

That
of
course
--
the
proved
ability
to
deal
with

dear
old
Woollett
,
since
I
'm
sure
she
does
deal
with
it

is
what
makes
*NL*
so
strongly
for
Mamie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
short
,
at
her
tone
,
before
her
;
then
,
though
seeing
that
it
*NL*
represented
not
vagueness
,
but
a
momentary
embarrassed
fulness
,
let
his
*NL*
exclamation
come
.
``
You
surely
have
n't
forgotten
about
Mamie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
forgotten
about
Mamie
,
''
she
smiled
.
``
There
's
no
doubt
*NL*
whatever
that
there
's
ever
so
much
to
be
said
for
her

's
MY
*NL*
girl
!
''
she
roundly
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
resumed
for
a
minute
his
walk
.
``
She
's
really
perfectly
*NL*
lovely
,
you
know

Far
prettier
than
any
girl
I
've
seen
over
here
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
precisely
on
what
I
perhaps
most
build
.
''
And
she
mused
a
*NL*
moment
in
her
friend
's
way
.
``
I
should
positively
like
to
take
her
in
*NL*
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
humoured
the
fancy
,
though
indeed
finally
to
deprecate
it
.
``
Oh
but
*NL*
do
n't
,
in
your
zeal

go
over
to
her
!
I
need
you
most

ca
n't

left

*NL*
*NL*
But
she
kept
it
up
.
``
I
wish
they
'd
send
her
out
to
me
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
knew
you

he
returned
,
``
they
would

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

n't
they

after
all
that

I
've
understood

them
about

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
paused
before
her
again
,
but
he
continued
his
course
``
They
*NL*
WILL

before

as
you
say
,
I
've
done

''
Then
he
came
out
with
the
point
*NL*
he
had
wished
after
all
most
to
make
.
``
It
seems
to
give
away
now
his
*NL*
game
.
This
is
what
he
has
been
doing
--
keeping
me
along
for
.
He
has
*NL*
been
waiting
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
drew
in
her
lips
.
``
You
see
a
good
deal
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
if
I
see
as
much
as
you
.
Do
you
pretend
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
see
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
''
--
she
pressed
him
as
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
there
must
be
a
lot
between
them
--
and
that
it
has
been
going
*NL*
on
from
the
first
;
even
from
before
I
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
minute
to
answer
.
``
Who
are
they
then
--
if
it
's
so
grave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
n't
be
grave
--
it
may
be
gay
.
But
at
any
rate
it
's
marked
.
Only
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
,
''
Strether
had
to
confess
,
``
anything
about
them
.
Their
*NL*
name
for
instance
was
a
thing
that
,
after
little
Bilham
's
information
,
*NL*
I
found
it
a
kind
of
refreshment
not
to
feel
obliged
to
follow
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
returned
,
``
if
you
think
you
've
got
off
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
laugh
produced
in
him
a
momentary
gloom
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
've
got
*NL*
off
.
I
only
think
I
'm
breathing
for
about
five
minutes
.
I
dare
say
I
*NL*
SHALL
have
,
at
the
best
,
still
to
get
on
.
''
A
look
,
over
it
all
,
passed
*NL*
between
them
,
and
the
next
minute
he
had
come
back
to
good
humour
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
meanwhile
take
the
smallest
interest
in
their
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
in
their
nationality
?
--
American
,
French
,
English
,
Polish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
the
least
little
`
hang
,
'
''
he
smiled
,
``
for
their
*NL*
nationality
.
It
would
be
nice
if
they
're
Polish
!
''
he
almost
*NL*
immediately
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
nice
indeed
.
''
The
transition
kept
up
her
spirits
.
``
So
you
see
*NL*
you
do
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
this
contention
a
modified
justice
.
``
I
think
I
should
if
they
*NL*
WERE
Polish
.
Yes
,
''
he
thought
--
``
there
might
be
joy
in
THAT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
then
hope
for
it
.
''
But
she
came
after
this
nearer
to
the
*NL*
question
.
``
If
the
girl
's
of
the
right
age
of
course
the
mother
ca
n't
*NL*
be
.
I
mean
for
the
virtuous
attachment
.
If
the
girl
's
twenty
--
and
she
*NL*
ca
n't
be
less
--
the
mother
must
be
at
least
forty
.
So
it
puts
the
mother
*NL*
out
.
SHE
'S
too
old
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
arrested
again
,
considered
and
demurred
.
``
Do
you
think
so
?
*NL*
Do
you
think
any
one
would
be
too
old
for
him
?
I
'M
eighty
,
and
I
'm
too
*NL*
young
.
But
perhaps
the
girl
,
''
he
continued
,
``
IS
n't
twenty
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
's
only
ten
--
but
such
a
little
dear
that
Chad
finds
himself
counting
*NL*
her
in
as
an
attraction
of
the
acquaintance
.
Perhaps
she
's
only
five
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
mother
's
but
five-and-twenty
--
a
charming
young
widow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
entertained
the
suggestion
.
``
She
IS
a
widow
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
the
least
idea
!
''
They
once
more
,
in
spite
of
this
*NL*
vagueness
,
exchanged
a
look
--
a
look
that
was
perhaps
the
longest
yet
.
*NL*
It
seemed
in
fact
,
the
next
thing
,
to
require
to
explain
itself
;
which
*NL*
it
did
as
it
could
.
``
I
only
feel
what
I
've
told
you
--
that
he
has
some
*NL*
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
's
imagination
had
taken
its
own
flight
.
``
Perhaps
she
's
*NL*
NOT
a
widow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
to
accept
the
possibility
with
reserve
.
Still
he
*NL*
accepted
it
.
``
Then
that
's
why
the
attachment
--
if
it
's
to
her
--
is
*NL*
virtuous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
looked
as
if
she
scarce
followed
.
``
Why
is
it
virtuous
*NL*
if
--
since
she
's
free
--
there
's
nothing
to
impose
on
it
any
condition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
at
her
question
.
``
Oh
I
perhaps
do
n't
mean
as
virtuous
as
*NL*
THAT
!
Your
idea
is
that
it
can
be
virtuous
--
in
any
sense
worthy
of
the
*NL*
name
--
only
if
she
's
NOT
free
?
But
what
does
it
become
then
,
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
``
for
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
another
matter
.
''
He
said
nothing
for
a
moment
,
and
she
soon
*NL*
went
on
.
``
I
dare
say
you
're
right
,
at
any
rate
,
about
Mr.
Newsome
's
*NL*
little
plan
.
He
HAS
been
trying
you
--
has
been
reporting
on
you
to
*NL*
these
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
meanwhile
had
had
time
to
think
more
.
``
Then
where
's
his
*NL*
straightness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
we
say
,
it
's
struggling
up
,
breaking
out
,
asserting
itself
as
*NL*
it
can
.
We
can
be
on
the
side
,
you
see
,
of
his
straightness
.
We
can
*NL*
help
him
.
But
he
has
made
out
,
''
said
Miss
Gostrey
,
``
that
you
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
for
THEM
--
for
ces
dames
.
He
has
watched
you
,
studied
you
,
liked
*NL*
you
--
and
recognised
that
THEY
must
.
It
's
a
great
compliment
to
you
,
my
*NL*
dear
man
;
for
I
'm
sure
they
're
particular
.
You
came
out
for
a
success
.
*NL*
Well
,
''
she
gaily
declared
,
``
you
're
having
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
from
her
with
momentary
patience
and
then
turned
abruptly
*NL*
away
.
It
was
always
convenient
to
him
that
there
were
so
many
fine
*NL*
things
in
her
room
to
look
at
.
But
the
examination
of
two
or
three
of
*NL*
them
appeared
soon
to
have
determined
a
speech
that
had
little
to
do
*NL*
with
them
.
``
You
do
n't
believe
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
character
of
the
attachment
.
In
its
innocence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
defended
herself
.
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
anything
about
it
.
*NL*
Everything
's
possible
.
We
must
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
?
''
he
echoed
with
a
groan
.
``
Have
n't
we
seen
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't

she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
suppose
then
little
Bilham
has
lied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
It
made
him
almost
turn
pale
.
``
Find
out
any
MORE
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
dropped
on
a
sofa
for
dismay
;
but
she
seemed
,
as
she
stood
over
*NL*
him
,
to
have
the
last
word
.

The
Sunday
of
the
next
week
was
a
wonderful
day
,
and
Chad
Newsome
had
*NL*
let
his
friend
know
in
advance
that
he
had
provided
for
it
.
There
had
*NL*
already
been
a
question
of
his
taking
him
to
see
the
great
Gloriani
,
*NL*
who
was
at
home
on
Sunday
afternoons
and
at
whose
house
,
for
the
most
*NL*
part
,
fewer
bores
were
to
be
met
than
elsewhere
;
but
the
project
,
*NL*
through
some
accident
,
had
not
had
instant
effect
,
and
now
revived
in
*NL*
happier
conditions
.
Chad
had
made
the
point
that
the
celebrated
*NL*
sculptor
had
a
queer
old
garden
,
for
which
the
weather
--
spring
at
last
*NL*
frank
and
fair
--
was
propitious
;
and
two
or
three
of
his
other
allusions
*NL*
had
confirmed
for
Strether
the
expectation
of
something
special
.
He
*NL*
had
by
this
time
,
for
all
introductions
and
adventures
,
let
himself
*NL*
recklessly
go
,
cherishing
the
sense
that
whatever
the
young
man
showed
*NL*
him
he
was
showing
at
least
himself
.
He
could
have
wished
indeed
,
so
*NL*
far
as
this
went
,
that
Chad
were
less
of
a
mere
cicerone
;
for
he
was
*NL*
not
without
the
impression
--
now
that
the
vision
of
his
game
,
his
plan
,
*NL*
his
deep
diplomacy
,
did
recurrently
assert
itself
--
of
his
taking
refuge
*NL*
from
the
realities
of
their
intercourse
in
profusely
dispensing
,
as
our
*NL*
friend
mentally
phrased
et
panem
et
circenses
.
Our
friend
continued
to
*NL*
feel
rather
smothered
in
flowers
,
though
he
made
in
his
other
moments
*NL*
the
almost
angry
inference
that
this
was
only
because
of
his
odious
*NL*
ascetic
suspicion
of
any
form
of
beauty
.
He
periodically
assured
*NL*
himself
--
for
his
reactions
were
sharp
--
that
he
should
n't
reach
the
*NL*
truth
of
anything
till
he
had
at
least
got
rid
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
known
beforehand
that
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
her
daughter
would
*NL*
probably
be
on
view
,
an
intimation
to
that
effect
having
constituted
*NL*
the
only
reference
again
made
by
Chad
to
his
good
friends
from
the
*NL*
south
.
The
effect
of
Strether
's
talk
about
them
with
Miss
Gostrey
had
*NL*
been
quite
to
consecrate
his
reluctance
to
pry
;
something
in
the
very
*NL*
air
of
Chad
's
silence
--
judged
in
the
light
of
that
talk
--
offered
it
to
*NL*
him
as
a
reserve
he
could
markedly
match
.
It
shrouded
them
about
with
*NL*
he
scarce
knew
what
,
a
consideration
,
a
distinction
;
he
was
in
presence
*NL*
at
any
rate
--
so
far
as
it
placed
him
there
--
of
ladies
;
and
the
one
*NL*
thing
that
was
definite
for
him
was
that
they
themselves
should
be
,
to
*NL*
the
extent
of
his
responsibility
,
in
presence
of
a
gentleman
.
Was
it
*NL*
because
they
were
very
beautiful
,
very
clever
,
or
even
very
good
--
was
*NL*
it
for
one
of
these
reasons
that
Chad
was
,
so
to
speak
,
nursing
his
*NL*
effect
?
Did
he
wish
to
spring
them
,
in
the
Woollett
phrase
,
with
a
*NL*
fuller
force
--
to
confound
his
critic
,
slight
though
as
yet
the
*NL*
criticism
,
with
some
form
of
merit
exquisitely
incalculable
?
The
most
*NL*
the
critic
had
at
all
events
asked
was
whether
the
persons
in
question
*NL*
were
French
;
and
that
enquiry
had
been
but
a
proper
comment
on
the
*NL*
sound
of
their
name
.
``
Yes
.
That
is
no
!
''
had
been
Chad
's
reply
;
but
he
*NL*
had
immediately
added
that
their
English
was
the
most
charming
in
the
*NL*
world
,
so
that
if
Strether
were
wanting
an
excuse
for
not
getting
on
*NL*
with
them
he
would
n't
in
the
least
find
one
.
Never
in
fact
had
*NL*
Strether
--
in
the
mood
into
which
the
place
had
quickly
launched
*NL*
him
--
felt
,
for
himself
,
less
the
need
of
an
excuse
.
Those
he
might
*NL*
have
found
would
have
been
,
at
the
worst
,
all
for
the
others
,
the
*NL*
people
before
him
,
in
whose
liberty
to
be
as
they
were
he
was
aware
*NL*
that
he
positively
rejoiced
.
His
fellow
guests
were
multiplying
,
and
*NL*
these
things
,
their
liberty
,
their
intensity
,
their
variety
,
their
*NL*
conditions
at
large
,
were
in
fusion
in
the
admirable
medium
of
the
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
itself
was
a
great
impression
--
a
small
pavilion
,
clear-faced
*NL*
and
sequestered
,
an
effect
of
polished
parquet
,
of
fine
white
panel
and
*NL*
spare
sallow
gilt
,
of
decoration
delicate
and
rare
,
in
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
and
on
the
edge
of
a
cluster
of
gardens
attached
*NL*
to
old
noble
houses
.
Far
back
from
streets
and
unsuspected
by
crowds
,
*NL*
reached
by
a
long
passage
and
a
quiet
court
,
it
was
as
striking
to
the
*NL*
unprepared
mind
,
he
immediately
saw
,
as
a
treasure
dug
up
;
giving
him
*NL*
too
,
more
than
anything
yet
,
the
note
of
the
range
of
the
immeasurable
*NL*
town
and
sweeping
away
,
as
by
a
last
brave
brush
,
his
usual
landmarks
*NL*
and
terms
.
It
was
in
the
garden
,
a
spacious
cherished
remnant
,
out
of
*NL*
which
a
dozen
persons
had
already
passed
,
that
Chad
's
host
presently
*NL*
met
them
while
the
tall
bird-haunted
trees
,
all
of
a
twitter
with
the
*NL*
spring
and
the
weather
,
and
the
high
party-walls
,
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
which
grave
hotels
stood
off
for
privacy
,
spoke
of
survival
,
*NL*
transmission
,
association
,
a
strong
indifferent
persistent
order
.
The
*NL*
day
was
so
soft
that
the
little
party
had
practically
adjourned
to
the
*NL*
open
air
but
the
open
air
was
in
such
conditions
all
a
chamber
of
*NL*
state
.
Strether
had
presently
the
sense
of
a
great
convent
,
a
convent
*NL*
of
missions
,
famous
for
he
scarce
knew
what
,
a
nursery
of
young
*NL*
priests
,
of
scattered
shade
,
of
straight
alleys
and
chapel-bells
,
that
*NL*
spread
its
mass
in
one
quarter
;
he
had
the
sense
of
names
in
the
air
,
*NL*
of
ghosts
at
the
windows
,
of
signs
and
tokens
,
a
whole
range
of
*NL*
expression
,
all
about
him
,
too
thick
for
prompt
discrimination
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
assault
of
images
became
for
a
moment
,
in
the
address
of
the
*NL*
distinguished
sculptor
,
almost
formidable
:
Gloriani
showed
him
,
in
*NL*
such
perfect
confidence
,
on
Chad
's
introduction
of
him
,
a
fine
worn
*NL*
handsome
face
,
a
face
that
was
like
an
open
letter
in
a
foreign
tongue
.
*NL*
With
his
genius
in
his
eyes
,
his
manners
on
his
lips
,
his
long
career
*NL*
behind
him
and
his
honours
and
rewards
all
round
,
the
great
artist
,
in
*NL*
the
course
of
a
single
sustained
look
and
a
few
words
of
delight
at
*NL*
receiving
him
,
affected
our
friend
as
a
dazzling
prodigy
of
type
.
*NL*
Strether
had
seen
in
museums
--
in
the
Luxembourg
as
well
as
,
more
*NL*
reverently
,
later
on
,
in
the
New
York
of
the
billionaires
--
the
work
of
*NL*
his
hand
;
knowing
too
that
after
an
earlier
time
in
his
native
Rome
he
*NL*
had
migrated
,
in
mid-career
,
to
Paris
,
where
,
with
a
personal
lustre
*NL*
almost
violent
,
he
shone
in
a
constellation
:
all
of
which
was
more
*NL*
than
enough
to
crown
him
,
for
his
guest
,
with
the
light
,
with
the
*NL*
romance
,
of
glory
.
Strether
,
in
contact
with
that
element
as
he
had
*NL*
never
yet
so
intimately
been
,
had
the
consciousness
of
opening
to
it
,
*NL*
for
the
happy
instant
,
all
the
windows
of
his
mind
,
of
letting
this
*NL*
rather
grey
interior
drink
in
for
once
the
sun
of
a
clime
not
marked
in
*NL*
his
old
geography
.
He
was
to
remember
again
repeatedly
the
medal-like
*NL*
Italian
face
,
in
which
every
line
was
an
artist
's
own
,
in
which
time
*NL*
told
only
as
tone
and
consecration
;
and
he
was
to
recall
in
especial
,
*NL*
as
the
penetrating
radiance
,
as
the
communication
of
the
illustrious
*NL*
spirit
itself
,
the
manner
in
which
,
while
they
stood
briefly
,
in
*NL*
welcome
and
response
,
face
to
face
,
he
was
held
by
the
sculptor
's
eyes
.
*NL*
He
was
n't
soon
to
forget
them
,
was
to
think
of
them
,
all
unconscious
,
*NL*
unintending
,
preoccupied
though
they
were
,
as
the
source
of
the
deepest
*NL*
intellectual
sounding
to
which
he
had
ever
been
exposed
.
He
was
in
*NL*
fact
quite
to
cherish
his
vision
of
it
,
to
play
with
it
in
idle
hours
;
*NL*
only
speaking
of
it
to
no
one
and
quite
aware
he
could
n't
have
spoken
*NL*
without
appearing
to
talk
nonsense
.
Was
what
it
had
told
him
or
what
*NL*
it
had
asked
him
the
greater
of
the
mysteries
?
Was
it
the
most
special
*NL*
flare
,
unequalled
,
supreme
,
of
the
aesthetic
torch
,
lighting
that
*NL*
wondrous
world
for
ever
,
or
was
it
above
all
the
long
straight
shaft
*NL*
sunk
by
a
personal
acuteness
that
life
had
seasoned
to
steel
?
Nothing
*NL*
on
earth
could
have
been
stranger
and
no
one
doubtless
more
surprised
*NL*
than
the
artist
himself
,
but
it
was
for
all
the
world
to
Strether
just
*NL*
then
as
if
in
the
matter
of
his
accepted
duty
he
had
positively
been
on
*NL*
trial
.
The
deep
human
expertness
in
Gloriani
's
charming
smile
--
oh
the
*NL*
terrible
life
behind
it
!
--
was
flashed
upon
him
as
a
test
of
his
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
meanwhile
,
after
having
easily
named
his
companion
,
had
still
more
*NL*
easily
turned
away
and
was
already
greeting
other
persons
present
.
He
*NL*
was
as
easy
,
clever
Chad
,
with
the
great
artist
as
with
his
obscure
*NL*
compatriot
,
and
as
easy
with
every
one
else
as
with
either
:
this
fell
*NL*
into
its
place
for
Strether
and
made
almost
a
new
light
,
giving
him
,
as
*NL*
a
concatenation
,
something
more
he
could
enjoy
.
He
liked
Gloriani
,
but
*NL*
should
never
see
him
again
;
of
that
he
was
sufficiently
sure
.
Chad
*NL*
accordingly
,
who
was
wonderful
with
both
of
them
,
was
a
kind
of
link
*NL*
for
hopeless
fancy
,
an
implication
of
possibilities
--
oh
if
everything
*NL*
had
been
different
!
Strether
noted
at
all
events
that
he
was
thus
on
*NL*
terms
with
illustrious
spirits
,
and
also
that
--
yes
,
distinctly
--
he
*NL*
had
n't
in
the
least
swaggered
about
it
.
Our
friend
had
n't
come
there
*NL*
only
for
this
figure
of
Abel
Newsome
's
son
,
but
that
presence
*NL*
threatened
to
affect
the
observant
mind
as
positively
central
.
Gloriani
*NL*
indeed
,
remembering
something
and
excusing
himself
,
pursued
Chad
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
and
Strether
was
left
musing
on
many
things
.
One
of
them
*NL*
was
the
question
of
whether
,
since
he
had
been
tested
,
he
had
passed
.
*NL*
Did
the
artist
drop
him
from
having
made
out
that
he
would
n't
do
?
He
*NL*
really
felt
just
to-day
that
he
might
do
better
than
usual
.
Had
n't
he
*NL*
done
well
enough
,
so
far
as
that
went
,
in
being
exactly
so
dazzled
?
and
*NL*
in
not
having
too
,
as
he
almost
believed
,
wholly
hidden
from
his
host
*NL*
that
he
felt
the
latter
's
plummet
?
Suddenly
,
across
the
garden
,
he
saw
*NL*
little
Bilham
approach
,
and
it
was
a
part
of
the
fit
that
was
on
him
*NL*
that
as
their
eyes
met
he
guessed
also
HIS
knowledge
.
If
he
had
said
to
*NL*
him
on
the
instant
what
was
uppermost
he
would
have
said
:
``
HAVE
I
*NL*
passed
?
--
for
of
course
I
know
one
has
to
pass
here
.
''
Little
Bilham
*NL*
would
have
reassured
him
,
have
told
him
that
he
exaggerated
,
and
have
*NL*
adduced
happily
enough
the
argument
of
little
Bilham
's
own
very
*NL*
presence
;
which
,
in
truth
,
he
could
see
,
was
as
easy
a
one
as
*NL*
Gloriani
's
own
or
as
Chad
's
.
He
himself
would
perhaps
then
after
a
*NL*
while
cease
to
be
frightened
,
would
get
the
point
of
view
for
some
of
*NL*
the
faces
--
types
tremendously
alien
,
alien
to
Woollett
--
that
he
had
*NL*
already
begun
to
take
in
.
Who
were
they
all
,
the
dispersed
groups
and
*NL*
couples
,
the
ladies
even
more
unlike
those
of
Woollett
than
the
*NL*
gentlemen
?
--
this
was
the
enquiry
that
,
when
his
young
friend
had
*NL*
greeted
him
,
he
did
find
himself
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
they
're
every
one
--
all
sorts
and
sizes
;
of
course
I
mean
within
*NL*
limits
,
though
limits
down
perhaps
rather
more
than
limits
up
.
There
*NL*
are
always
artists
--
he
's
beautiful
and
inimitable
to
the
cher
confrere
;
*NL*
and
then
gros
bonnets
of
many
kinds
--
ambassadors
,
cabinet
ministers
,
*NL*
bankers
,
generals
,
what
do
I
know
?
even
Jews
.
Above
all
always
some
*NL*
awfully
nice
women
--
and
not
too
many
;
sometimes
an
actress
,
an
artist
,
*NL*
a
great
performer
--
but
only
when
they
're
not
monsters
;
and
in
*NL*
particular
the
right
femmes
du
monde
.
You
can
fancy
his
history
on
that
*NL*
side
--
I
believe
it
's
fabulous
:
they
NEVER
give
him
up
.
Yet
he
keeps
*NL*
them
down
:
no
one
knows
how
he
manages
;
it
's
too
beautiful
and
bland
.
*NL*
Never
too
many
--
and
a
mighty
good
thing
too
;
just
a
perfect
choice
.
But
*NL*
there
are
not
in
any
way
many
bores
;
it
has
always
been
so
;
he
has
some
*NL*
secret
.
It
's
extraordinary
.
And
you
do
n't
find
it
out
.
He
's
the
same
*NL*
to
every
one
.
He
does
n't
ask
questions
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
does
n't
he
?
''
Strether
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bilham
met
it
with
all
his
candour
.
``
How
then
should
I
be
here
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
for
what
you
tell
me
.
You
're
part
of
the
perfect
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
the
young
man
took
in
the
scene
.
``
It
seems
rather
good
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
.
``
Are
they
all
,
this
time
,
*NL*
femmes
du
monde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
showed
his
competence
.
``
Pretty
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
category
our
friend
had
a
feeling
for
;
a
light
,
romantic
and
*NL*
mysterious
,
on
the
feminine
element
,
in
which
he
enjoyed
for
a
little
*NL*
watching
it
.
``
Are
there
any
Poles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
considered
.
``
I
think
I
make
out
a
`
Portuguee
.
'
But
I
've
*NL*
seen
Turks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
,
desiring
justice
.
``
They
seem
--
all
the
women
--
very
*NL*
harmonious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
in
closer
quarters
they
come
out
!
''
And
then
,
while
Strether
was
*NL*
aware
of
fearing
closer
quarters
,
though
giving
himself
again
to
the
*NL*
harmonies
,
``
Well
,
''
little
Bilham
went
on
,
``
it
IS
at
the
worst
rather
*NL*
good
,
you
know
.
If
you
like
it
,
you
feel
it
,
this
way
,
that
shows
*NL*
you
're
not
in
the
least
out
But
you
always
know
things
,
''
he
handsomely
*NL*
added
,
``
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
liked
it
and
felt
it
only
too
much
;
so
``
I
say
,
do
n't
lay
traps
*NL*
for
me
!
''
he
rather
helplessly
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
his
companion
returned
,
``
he
's
wonderfully
kind
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
us
Americans
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
he
does
n't
know
anything
about
THAT
.
That
's
half
the
battle
*NL*
here
--
that
you
can
never
hear
politics
.
We
do
n't
talk
them
.
I
mean
to
*NL*
poor
young
wretches
of
all
sorts
.
And
yet
it
's
always
as
charming
as
*NL*
this
;
it
's
as
if
,
by
something
in
the
air
,
our
squalor
did
n't
show
.
It
*NL*
puts
us
all
back
--
into
the
last
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
''
Strether
said
,
amused
,
``
that
it
puts
me
rather
forward
:
*NL*
oh
ever
so
far
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
the
next
?
But
is
n't
that
only
,
''
little
Bilham
asked
,
``
because
*NL*
you
're
really
of
the
century
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
century
before
the
last
?
Thank
you
!
''
Strether
laughed
.
``
If
I
ask
*NL*
you
about
some
of
the
ladies
it
ca
n't
be
then
that
I
may
hope
,
as
such
*NL*
a
specimen
of
the
rococo
,
to
please
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
they
adore
--
we
all
adore
here
--
the
rococo
,
and
where
*NL*
is
there
a
better
setting
for
it
than
the
whole
thing
,
the
pavilion
and
*NL*
the
garden
,
together
?
There
are
lots
of
people
with
collections
,
''
*NL*
little
Bilham
smiled
as
he
glanced
round
.
``
You
'll
be
secured
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
Strether
for
a
moment
give
himself
again
to
contemplation
.
*NL*
There
were
faces
he
scarce
knew
what
to
make
of
.
Were
they
charming
or
*NL*
were
they
only
strange
?
He
might
n't
talk
politics
,
yet
he
suspected
a
*NL*
Pole
or
two
.
The
upshot
was
the
question
at
the
back
of
his
head
from
*NL*
the
moment
his
friend
had
joined
him
.
``
Have
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
her
*NL*
daughter
arrived
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
them
yet
,
but
Miss
Gostrey
has
come
.
She
's
in
the
*NL*
pavilion
looking
at
objects
.
One
can
see
SHE
'S
a
collector
,
''
little
*NL*
Bilham
added
without
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
she
's
a
collector
,
and
I
knew
she
was
to
come
.
Is
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
a
collector
?
''
Strether
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
,
I
believe
;
almost
celebrated
.
''
The
young
man
met
,
on
it
,
a
*NL*
little
,
his
friend
's
eyes
.
``
I
happen
to
know
--
from
Chad
,
whom
I
saw
*NL*
last
night
--
that
they
've
come
back
;
but
only
yesterday
.
He
was
n't
*NL*
sure
--
up
to
the
last
.
This
,
accordingly
,
''
little
Bilham
went
on
,
``
will
*NL*
be
--
if
they
ARE
here
--
their
first
appearance
after
their
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
very
quickly
,
turned
these
things
over
.
``
Chad
told
you
last
*NL*
night
?
To
me
,
on
our
way
here
,
he
said
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
ask
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
did
him
the
justice
.
``
I
dare
say
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
little
Bilham
,
``
you
're
not
a
person
to
whom
it
's
easy
to
*NL*
tell
things
you
do
n't
want
to
know
.
Though
it
is
easy
,
I
admit
--
it
's
*NL*
quite
beautiful
,
''
he
benevolently
added
,
``
when
you
do
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
at
him
with
an
indulgence
that
matched
his
*NL*
intelligence
.
``
Is
that
the
deep
reasoning
on
which
--
about
these
*NL*
ladies
--
you
've
been
yourself
so
silent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
considered
the
depth
of
his
reasoning
.
``
I
have
n't
been
*NL*
silent
.
I
spoke
of
them
to
you
the
other
day
,
the
day
we
sat
together
*NL*
after
Chad
's
tea-party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
came
round
to
it
.
``
They
then
are
the
virtuous
attachment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
tell
you
that
it
's
what
they
pass
for
.
But
is
n't
that
*NL*
enough
?
What
more
than
a
vain
appearance
does
the
wisest
of
us
know
?
I
*NL*
commend
you
,
''
the
young
man
declared
with
a
pleasant
emphasis
,
``
the
*NL*
vain
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
more
widely
round
,
and
what
he
saw
,
from
face
to
face
,
*NL*
deepened
the
effect
of
his
young
friend
's
words
.
``
Is
it
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magnificent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
a
pause
.
``
The
husband
's
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
no
.
Alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Strether
.
After
which
,
as
his
companion
laughed
:
``
How
then
*NL*
can
it
be
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
for
yourself
.
One
does
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chad
's
in
love
with
the
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
``
Then
where
's
the
difficulty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
n't
you
and
I
--
with
our
grander
bolder
ideas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
mine
--
!
''
Strether
said
rather
strangely
.
But
then
as
if
to
*NL*
attenuate
:
``
You
mean
they
wo
n't
hear
of
Woollett
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
smiled
.
``
Is
n't
that
just
what
you
must
see
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
brought
them
,
as
she
caught
the
last
words
,
into
relation
with
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
,
whom
Strether
had
already
observed
--
as
he
had
never
*NL*
before
seen
a
lady
at
a
party
--
moving
about
alone
.
Coming
within
sound
*NL*
of
them
she
had
already
spoken
,
and
she
took
again
,
through
her
*NL*
long-handled
glass
,
all
her
amused
and
amusing
possession
.
``
How
much
,
*NL*
poor
Mr.
Strether
,
you
seem
to
have
to
see
about
!
But
you
ca
n't
say
,
''
*NL*
she
gaily
declared
,
``
that
I
do
n't
do
what
I
can
to
help
you
.
Mr.
*NL*
Waymarsh
is
placed
.
I
've
left
him
in
the
house
with
Miss
Gostrey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
,
''
little
Bilham
exclaimed
,
``
Mr.
Strether
gets
the
ladies
to
*NL*
work
for
him
!
He
's
just
preparing
to
draw
in
another
;
to
pounce
--
do
n't
*NL*
you
see
him
?
--
on
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Vionnet
?
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
''
Miss
Barrace
cried
in
a
wonderful
*NL*
crescendo
.
There
was
more
in
it
,
our
friend
made
out
,
than
met
the
*NL*
ear
.
Was
it
after
all
a
joke
that
he
should
be
serious
about
anything
?
*NL*
He
envied
Miss
Barrace
at
any
rate
her
power
of
not
being
.
She
seemed
,
*NL*
with
little
cries
and
protests
and
quick
recognitions
,
movements
like
*NL*
the
darts
of
some
fine
high-feathered
free-pecking
bird
,
to
stand
*NL*
before
life
as
before
some
full
shop-window
.
You
could
fairly
hear
,
as
*NL*
she
selected
and
pointed
,
the
tap
of
her
tortoise-shell
against
the
*NL*
glass
.
``
It
's
certain
that
we
do
need
seeing
about
;
only
I
'm
glad
it
's
*NL*
not
I
who
have
to
do
it
.
One
does
,
no
doubt
,
begin
that
way
;
then
*NL*
suddenly
one
finds
that
one
has
given
it
up
.
It
's
too
much
,
it
's
too
*NL*
difficult
.
You
're
wonderful
,
you
people
,
''
she
continued
to
Strether
,
*NL*
``
for
not
feeling
those
things
--
by
which
I
mean
impossibilities
.
You
*NL*
never
feel
them

You
face
them
with
a
fortitude
that
makes
it
a
lesson
*NL*
to
watch
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
''
--
little
Bilham
put
it
with
discouragement
--
``
what
do
we
achieve
*NL*
after
all
?
We
see
about
you
and
report

when
we
even
go
so
far
as

reporting
.
But
nothing
's
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
,
Mr.
Bilham
,
''
she
replied
as
with
an
impatient
rap
on
the
*NL*
glass
,
``
you
're
not
worth
sixpence
!
You
come
over
to
convert
the
*NL*
savages

I

you
verily
did
,
I
remember
you

and
the
savages
*NL*
simply
convert
YOU

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
!
''
the
young
man
woefully
confessed
:
``
they
have
n't
gone
*NL*
through
that
form
.
They
've
simply
--
the
cannibals
!
--
eaten
me
;
converted
*NL*
me
if
you
like
,

converted
me
into
food

the

Christian

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
there
we
are
!
Only
''
--
and
Miss
Barrace
appealed
again
to
*NL*
Strether
--
``
do
n't
let
it
discourage
you

You
'll
break
down
soon
enough

meanwhile
have
had
your
moments

always

I
'll
tell
you
who
WILL
*NL*
last

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waymarsh
?
''
--
he
had
already
taken
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
out
as
at
the
alarm
of
it
.
``
He
'll
resist
even
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
:
so
grand
is
it
not
to
understand

He
's
wonderful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
indeed
,
''
Strether
conceded
.
``
He
would
n't
tell
me
of
this
*NL*
affair

only
said
he
had
an
engagement
;
but
with
such
a
gloom
,
you
must
*NL*
let
me
insist
,
as
if
it
had
been
an
engagement
to
be
hanged

Then
*NL*
silently
and
secretly
he
turns
up
here
with
you

Do
you
call
THAT
*NL*
`
lasting
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
hope
it
's
lasting
!
''
Miss
Barrace
said
.
``
But
he
only
,
at
the
*NL*
best
,
bears
with
me
.
He
does
n't
understand
--
not
one
little
scrap
.
He
's
*NL*
delightful
.
He
's
wonderful
,
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Michelangelesque
!
''
--
little
Bilham
completed
her
meaning
.
``
He
IS
a
*NL*
success
.
Moses
,
on
the
ceiling
,
brought
down
to
the
floor
;
*NL*
overwhelming
,
colossal
,
but
somehow
portable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
if
you
mean
by
portable
,
''
she
returned
,
``
looking
so
well
in
*NL*
one
's
carriage
.
He
's
too
funny
beside
me
in
his
comer
;
he
looks
like
*NL*
somebody
,
somebody
foreign
and
famous
,
en
exil
;
so
that
people
*NL*
wonder
--
it
's
very
amusing
--
whom
I
'm
taking
about
.
I
show
him
Paris
,
*NL*
show
him
everything
,
and
he
never
turns
a
hair
.
He
's
like
the
Indian
*NL*
chief
one
reads
about
,
who
,
when
he
comes
up
to
Washington
to
see
the
*NL*
Great
Father
,
stands
wrapt
in
his
blanket
and
gives
no
sign

I
might
*NL*
be
the
Great
Father
--
from
the
way
he
takes
everything
.
''
She
was
*NL*
delighted
at
this
hit
of
her
identity
with
that
personage
--
it
fitted
so
*NL*
her
character
;
she
declared
it
was
the
title
she
meant
henceforth
to
*NL*
adopt
.
``
And
the
way
he
sits
,
too
,
in
the
corner
of
my
room
,
only
*NL*
looking
at
my
visitors
very
hard
and
as
if
he
wanted
to
start
*NL*
something
!
They
wonder
what
he
does
want
to
start
.
But
he
's
*NL*
wonderful
,
''
Miss
Barrace
once
more
insisted
.
``
He
has
never
started
*NL*
anything
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
presented
him
none
the
less
,
in
truth
,
to
her
actual
friends
,
who
*NL*
looked
at
each
other
in
intelligence
,
with
frank
amusement
on
Bilham
's
*NL*
part
and
a
shade
of
sadness
on
Strether
's
.
Strether
's
sadness
*NL*
sprang
--
for
the
image
had
its
grandeur
--
from
his
thinking
how
little
he
*NL*
himself
was
wrapt
in
his
blanket
,
how
little
,
in
marble
halls
,
all
too
*NL*
oblivious
of
the
Great
Father
,
he
resembled
a
really
majestic
*NL*
aboriginal
.
But
he
had
also
another
reflexion
.
``
You
've
all
of
you
here
*NL*
so
much
visual
sense
that
you
've
somehow
all
`
run
'
to
it
.
There
are
*NL*
moments
when
it
strikes
one
that
you
have
n't
any
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
moral
,
''
little
Bilham
explained
,
watching
serenely
,
across
the
*NL*
garden
,
the
several
femmes
du
monde
.
``
But
Miss
Barrace
has
a
moral
*NL*
distinction
,
''
he
kindly
continued
;
speaking
as
if
for
Strether
's
*NL*
benefit
not
less
than
for
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
HAVE
you
?
''
Strether
,
scarce
knowing
what
he
was
about
,
asked
of
her
*NL*
almost
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
not
a
distinction
''
--
she
was
mightily
amused
at
his
tone
--
``
Mr.
*NL*
Bilham
's
too
good
.
But
I
think
I
may
say
a
sufficiency
.
Yes
,
a
*NL*
sufficiency
.
Have
you
supposed
strange
things
of
me
?
''
--
and
she
fixed
*NL*
him
again
,
through
all
her
tortoise-shell
,
with
the
droll
interest
of
*NL*
it
.
``
You
ARE
all
indeed
wonderful
.
I
should
awfully
disappoint
you
.
I
*NL*
do
take
my
stand
on
my
sufficiency

But
I
know
,
I
confess
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
,
``
strange
people
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
happens
;
I
do
n't
do
it
on
*NL*
purpose
;
it
seems
to
be
my
doom
--
as
if
I
were
always
one
of
their
*NL*
habits
:
it
's
wonderful
!
I
dare
say
moreover
,
''
she
pursued
with
an
*NL*
interested
gravity
,
``
that
I
do
,
that
we
all
do
here
,
run
too
much
to
*NL*
mere
eye
.
But
how
can
it
be
helped
?
We
're
all
looking
at
each
*NL*
other
--
and
in
the
light
of
Paris
one
sees
what
things
resemble
.
That
's
*NL*
what
the
light
of
Paris
seems
always
to
show
.
It
's
the
fault
of
the
*NL*
light
of
Paris
--
dear
old
light
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
Paris
!
''
little
Bilham
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
every
one
shows
,
''
Miss
Barrace
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
what
they
really
are
?
''
Strether
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
like
your
Boston
`
reallys
'
!
But
sometimes
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
Paris
then
!
''
Strether
resignedly
sighed
while
for
a
moment
*NL*
they
looked
at
each
other
.
Then
he
broke
out
:
``
Does
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
do
that
?
I
mean
really
show
for
what
she
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
answer
was
prompt
.
``
She
's
charming
.
She
's
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
a
minute
ago
say
`
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
'
at
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
easily
remembered
.
``
Why
just
because
--
!
She
's
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
she
too
?
''
--
Strether
had
almost
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miss
Barrace
had
meanwhile
perceived
relief
.
``
Why
not
put
your
*NL*
question
straight
to
the
person
who
can
answer
it
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
little
Bilham
;
``
do
n't
put
any
question
;
wait
,
rather
--
it
*NL*
will
be
much
more
fun
--
to
judge
for
yourself

He
has
come
to
take
you
*NL*
to
her

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
Strether
saw
that
Chad
was
again
at
hand
,
and
he
afterwards
*NL*
scarce
knew
,
absurd
as
it
may
seem
,
what
had
then
quickly
occurred
.
The
*NL*
moment
concerned
him
,
he
felt
,
more
deeply
than
he
could
have
*NL*
explained
,
and
he
had
a
subsequent
passage
of
speculation
as
to
*NL*
whether
,
on
walking
off
with
Chad
,
he
had
n't
looked
either
pale
or
red
.
*NL*
The
only
thing
he
was
clear
about
was
that
,
luckily
,
nothing
indiscreet
*NL*
had
in
fact
been
said
and
that
Chad
himself
was
more
than
ever
,
in
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
's
great
sense
,
wonderful
.
It
was
one
of
the
connexions
--
though
*NL*
really
why
it
should
be
,
after
all
,
was
none
so
apparent
--
in
which
the
*NL*
whole
change
in
him
came
out
as
most
striking
.
Strether
recalled
as
*NL*
they
approached
the
house
that
he
had
impressed
him
that
first
night
as
*NL*
knowing
how
to
enter
a
box
.
Well
,
he
impressed
him
scarce
less
now
as
*NL*
knowing
how
to
make
a
presentation
.
It
did
something
for
Strether
's
*NL*
own
quality
--
marked
it
as
estimated
;
so
that
our
poor
friend
,
conscious
*NL*
and
passive
,
really
seemed
to
feel
himself
quite
handed
over
and
*NL*
delivered
;
absolutely
,
as
he
would
have
said
,
made
a
present
of
,
given
*NL*
away
.
As
they
reached
the
house
a
young
woman
,
about
to
come
forth
,
*NL*
appeared
,
unaccompanied
,
on
the
steps
;
at
the
exchange
with
whom
of
a
*NL*
word
on
Chad
's
part
Strether
immediately
perceived
that
,
obligingly
,
*NL*
kindly
,
she
was
there
to
meet
them
.
Chad
had
left
her
in
the
house
,
but
*NL*
she
had
afterwards
come
halfway
and
then
the
next
moment
had
joined
*NL*
them
in
the
garden
.
Her
air
of
youth
,
for
Strether
,
was
at
first
almost
*NL*
disconcerting
,
while
his
second
impression
was
,
not
less
sharply
,
a
*NL*
degree
of
relief
at
there
not
having
just
been
,
with
the
others
,
any
*NL*
freedom
used
about
her
.
It
was
upon
him
at
a
touch
that
she
was
no
*NL*
subject
for
that
,
and
meanwhile
,
on
Chad
's
introducing
him
,
she
had
*NL*
spoken
to
him
,
very
simply
and
gently
,
in
an
English
clearly
of
the
*NL*
easiest
to
her
,
yet
unlike
any
other
he
had
ever
heard
.
It
was
n't
as
*NL*
if
she
tried
;
nothing
,
he
could
see
after
they
had
been
a
few
minutes
*NL*
together
,
was
as
if
she
tried
;
but
her
speech
,
charming
correct
and
*NL*
odd
,
was
like
a
precaution
against
her
passing
for
a
Pole
.
There
were
*NL*
precautions
,
he
seemed
indeed
to
see
,
only
when
there
were
really
*NL*
dangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
he
was
to
feel
many
more
of
them
,
but
by
that
time
he
was
to
*NL*
feel
other
things
besides
.
She
was
dressed
in
black
,
but
in
black
that
*NL*
struck
him
as
light
and
transparent
;
she
was
exceedingly
fair
,
and
,
*NL*
though
she
was
as
markedly
slim
,
her
face
had
a
roundness
,
with
eyes
*NL*
far
apart
and
a
little
strange
.
Her
smile
was
natural
and
dim
;
her
hat
*NL*
not
extravagant
;
he
had
only
perhaps
a
sense
of
the
clink
,
beneath
her
*NL*
fine
black
sleeves
,
of
more
gold
bracelets
and
bangles
than
he
had
ever
*NL*
seen
a
lady
wear
.
Chad
was
excellently
free
and
light
about
their
*NL*
encounter
;
it
was
one
of
the
occasions
on
which
Strether
most
wished
he
*NL*
himself
might
have
arrived
at
such
ease
and
such
humour
:
``
Here
you
are
*NL*
then
,
face
to
face
at
last
;
you
're
made
for
each
other
--
vous
allez
*NL*
voir
;
and
I
bless
your
union
.
''
It
was
indeed
,
after
he
had
gone
off
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
partly
serious
too
.
This
latter
motion
had
been
*NL*
determined
by
an
enquiry
from
him
about
``
Jeanne
''
;
to
which
her
mother
*NL*
had
replied
that
she
was
probably
still
in
the
house
with
Miss
Gostrey
,
*NL*
to
whom
she
had
lately
committed
her
.
``
Ah
but
you
know
,
''
the
young
man
*NL*
had
rejoined
,
``
he
must
see
her
''
;
with
which
,
while
Strether
pricked
up
*NL*
his
ears
,
he
had
started
as
if
to
bring
her
,
leaving
the
other
objects
*NL*
of
his
interest
together
.
Strether
wondered
to
find
Miss
Gostrey
*NL*
already
involved
,
feeling
that
he
missed
a
link
;
but
feeling
also
,
with
*NL*
small
delay
,
how
much
he
should
like
to
talk
with
her
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
on
this
basis
of
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evidence
as
yet
in
truth
was
meagre
;
which
,
for
that
matter
,
was
*NL*
perhaps
a
little
why
his
expectation
had
had
a
drop
.
There
was
somehow
*NL*
not
quite
a
wealth
in
her
;
and
a
wealth
was
all
that
,
in
his
*NL*
simplicity
,
he
had
definitely
prefigured
.
Still
,
it
was
too
much
to
be
*NL*
sure
already
that
there
was
but
a
poverty
.
They
moved
away
from
the
*NL*
house
,
and
,
with
eyes
on
a
bench
at
some
distance
,
he
proposed
that
*NL*
they
should
sit
down
.
``
I
've
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
,
''
she
said
as
*NL*
they
went
;
but
he
had
an
answer
to
it
that
made
her
stop
short
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
about
YOU
,
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
I
've
heard
,
I
'm
bound
to
say
,
almost
*NL*
nothing
''
--
those
struck
him
as
the
only
words
he
himself
could
utter
*NL*
with
any
lucidity
;
conscious
as
he
was
,
and
as
with
more
reason
,
of
the
*NL*
determination
to
be
in
respect
to
the
rest
of
his
business
perfectly
*NL*
plain
and
go
perfectly
straight
.
It
had
n't
at
any
rate
been
in
the
*NL*
least
his
idea
to
spy
on
Chad
's
proper
freedom
.
It
was
possibly
,
*NL*
however
,
at
this
very
instant
and
under
the
impression
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
's
pause
,
that
going
straight
began
to
announce
itself
as
a
*NL*
matter
for
care
.
She
had
only
after
all
to
smile
at
him
ever
so
gently
*NL*
in
order
to
make
him
ask
himself
if
he
were
n't
already
going
crooked
.
*NL*
It
might
be
going
crooked
to
find
it
of
a
sudden
just
only
clear
that
*NL*
she
intended
very
definitely
to
be
what
he
would
have
called
nice
to
*NL*
him
.
This
was
what
passed
between
them
while
,
for
another
instant
,
*NL*
they
stood
still
;
he
could
n't
at
least
remember
afterwards
what
else
it
*NL*
might
have
been
.
The
thing
indeed
really
unmistakeable
was
its
rolling
*NL*
over
him
as
a
wave
that
he
had
been
,
in
conditions
incalculable
and
*NL*
unimaginable
,
a
subject
of
discussion
.
He
had
been
,
on
some
ground
*NL*
that
concerned
her
,
answered
for
;
which
gave
her
an
advantage
he
should
*NL*
never
be
able
to
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
Miss
Gostrey
,
''
she
asked
,
``
said
a
good
word
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
struck
him
first
was
the
way
he
was
bracketed
with
that
lady
;
*NL*
and
he
wondered
what
account
Chad
would
have
given
of
their
*NL*
acquaintance
.
Something
not
as
yet
traceable
,
at
all
events
,
had
*NL*
obviously
happened
.
``
I
did
n't
even
know
of
her
knowing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
she
'll
tell
you
all
.
I
'm
so
glad
you
're
in
relation
with
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
one
of
the
things
--
the
``
all
''
Miss
Gostrey
would
now
tell
*NL*
him
--
that
,
with
every
deference
to
present
preoccupation
,
was
uppermost
*NL*
for
Strether
after
they
had
taken
their
seat
.
One
of
the
others
was
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
,
that
she
--
oh
incontestably
,
yes
--
DIFFERED
*NL*
less
;
differed
,
that
is
,
scarcely
at
all
--
well
,
superficially
speaking
,
*NL*
from
Mrs.
Newsome
or
even
from
Mrs.
Pocock
.
She
was
ever
so
much
*NL*
younger
than
the
one
and
not
so
young
as
the
other
;
but
what
WAS
there
*NL*
in
her
,
if
anything
,
that
would
have
made
it
impossible
he
should
meet
*NL*
her
at
Woollett
?
And
wherein
was
her
talk
during
their
moments
on
the
*NL*
bench
together
not
the
same
as
would
have
been
found
adequate
for
a
*NL*
Woollett
garden-party
?
--
unless
perhaps
truly
in
not
being
quite
so
*NL*
bright
.
She
observed
to
him
that
Mr.
Newsome
had
,
to
her
knowledge
,
*NL*
taken
extraordinary
pleasure
in
his
visit
;
but
there
was
no
good
lady
*NL*
at
Woollett
who
would
n't
have
been
at
least
up
to
that
.
Was
there
in
*NL*
Chad
,
by
chance
,
after
all
,
deep
down
,
a
principle
of
aboriginal
*NL*
loyalty
that
had
made
him
,
for
sentimental
ends
,
attach
himself
to
*NL*
elements
,
happily
encountered
,
that
would
remind
him
most
of
the
old
*NL*
air
and
the
old
soil
?
Why
accordingly
be
in
a
flutter
--
Strether
could
*NL*
even
put
it
that
way
--
about
this
unfamiliar
phenomenon
of
the
femme
du
*NL*
monde
?
On
these
terms
Mrs.
Newsome
herself
was
as
much
of
one
.
Little
*NL*
Bilham
verily
had
testified
that
they
came
out
,
the
ladies
of
the
type
,
*NL*
in
close
quarters
;
but
it
was
just
in
these
quarters
--
now
comparatively
*NL*
close
--
that
he
felt
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
common
humanity
.
She
did
come
*NL*
out
,
and
certainly
to
his
relief
,
but
she
came
out
as
the
usual
thing
.
*NL*
There
might
be
motives
behind
,
but
so
could
there
often
be
even
at
*NL*
Woollett
.
The
only
thing
was
that
if
she
showed
him
she
wished
to
like
*NL*
him
--
as
the
motives
behind
might
conceivably
prompt
--
it
would
possibly
*NL*
have
been
more
thrilling
for
him
that
she
should
have
shown
as
more
*NL*
vividly
alien
.
Ah
she
was
neither
Turk
nor
Pole
!
--
which
would
be
*NL*
indeed
flat
once
more
for
Mrs.
Newsome
and
Mrs.
Pocock
.
A
lady
and
two
*NL*
gentlemen
had
meanwhile
,
however
,
approached
their
bench
,
and
this
*NL*
accident
stayed
for
the
time
further
developments
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
presently
addressed
his
companion
,
the
brilliant
strangers
;
she
*NL*
rose
to
speak
to
them
,
and
Strether
noted
how
the
escorted
lady
,
though
*NL*
mature
and
by
no
means
beautiful
,
had
more
of
the
bold
high
look
,
the
*NL*
range
of
expensive
reference
,
that
he
had
,
as
might
have
been
said
,
*NL*
made
his
plans
for
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
greeted
her
as
``
Duchesse
''
and
*NL*
was
greeted
in
turn
,
while
talk
started
in
French
,
as
``
Ma
toute-belle
''
;
*NL*
little
facts
that
had
their
due
,
their
vivid
interest
for
Strether
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
did
n't
,
none
the
less
,
introduce
him
--
a
note
he
was
*NL*
conscious
of
as
false
to
the
Woollett
scale
and
the
Woollett
humanity
;
*NL*
though
it
did
n't
prevent
the
Duchess
,
who
struck
him
as
confident
and
*NL*
free
,
very
much
what
he
had
obscurely
supposed
duchesses
,
from
looking
*NL*
at
him
as
straight
and
as
hard
--
for
it
WAS
hard
--
as
if
she
would
have
*NL*
liked
,
all
the
same
,
to
know
him
.
``
Oh
yes
,
my
dear
,
it
's
all
right
,
*NL*
it
's
ME
;
and
who
are
YOU
,
with
your
interesting
wrinkles
and
your
most
*NL*
effective
-LRB-
is
it
the
handsomest
,
is
it
the
ugliest
?
-RRB-
of
noses
?
''
--
some
*NL*
such
loose
handful
of
bright
flowers
she
seemed
,
fragrantly
enough
,
to
*NL*
fling
at
him
.
Strether
almost
wondered
--
at
such
a
pace
was
he
*NL*
going
--
if
some
divination
of
the
influence
of
either
party
were
what
*NL*
determined
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
abstention
.
One
of
the
gentlemen
,
in
*NL*
any
case
,
succeeded
in
placing
himself
in
close
relation
with
our
*NL*
friend
's
companion
;
a
gentleman
rather
stout
and
importantly
short
,
in
*NL*
a
hat
with
a
wonderful
wide
curl
to
its
brim
and
a
frock
coat
buttoned
*NL*
with
an
effect
of
superlative
decision
.
His
French
had
quickly
turned
*NL*
to
equal
English
,
and
it
occurred
to
Strether
that
he
might
well
be
one
*NL*
of
the
ambassadors
.
His
design
was
evidently
to
assert
a
claim
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
undivided
countenance
,
and
he
made
it
good
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
minute
--
led
her
away
with
a
trick
of
three
words
;
a
trick
*NL*
played
with
a
social
art
of
which
Strether
,
looking
after
them
as
the
*NL*
four
,
whose
backs
were
now
all
turned
,
moved
off
,
felt
himself
no
*NL*
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
again
upon
his
bench
and
,
while
his
eyes
followed
the
party
,
*NL*
reflected
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
on
Chad
's
strange
communities
.
He
*NL*
sat
there
alone
for
five
minutes
,
with
plenty
to
think
of
;
above
all
*NL*
with
his
sense
of
having
suddenly
been
dropped
by
a
charming
woman
*NL*
overlaid
now
by
other
impressions
and
in
fact
quite
cleared
and
*NL*
indifferent
.
He
had
n't
yet
had
so
quiet
a
surrender
;
he
did
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
care
if
nobody
spoke
to
him
more
.
He
might
have
been
,
by
his
*NL*
attitude
,
in
for
something
of
a
march
so
broad
that
the
want
of
*NL*
ceremony
with
which
he
had
just
been
used
could
fall
into
its
place
as
*NL*
but
a
minor
incident
of
the
procession
.
Besides
,
there
would
be
*NL*
incidents
enough
,
as
he
felt
when
this
term
of
contemplation
was
closed
*NL*
by
the
reappearance
of
little
Bilham
,
who
stood
before
him
a
moment
*NL*
with
a
suggestive
``
Well
?
''
in
which
he
saw
himself
reflected
as
*NL*
disorganised
,
as
possibly
floored
.
He
replied
with
a
``
Well
!
''
intended
*NL*
to
show
that
he
was
n't
floored
in
the
least
.
No
indeed
;
he
gave
it
*NL*
out
,
as
the
young
man
sat
down
beside
him
,
that
if
,
at
the
worst
,
he
*NL*
had
been
overturned
at
all
,
he
had
been
overturned
into
the
upper
air
,
*NL*
the
sublimer
element
with
which
he
had
an
affinity
and
in
which
he
*NL*
might
be
trusted
a
while
to
float
.
It
was
n't
a
descent
to
earth
to
say
*NL*
after
an
instant
and
in
sustained
response
to
the
reference
:
``
You
're
*NL*
quite
sure
her
husband
's
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
after
all
to
think
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
sorry
for
them
.
''
But
it
*NL*
did
n't
for
the
moment
matter
more
than
that
.
He
assured
his
young
*NL*
friend
he
was
quite
content
.
They
would
n't
stir
;
were
all
right
as
*NL*
they
were
.
He
did
n't
want
to
be
introduced
;
had
been
introduced
*NL*
already
about
as
far
as
he
could
go
.
He
had
seen
moreover
an
*NL*
immensity
;
liked
Gloriani
,
who
,
as
Miss
Barrace
kept
saying
,
was
*NL*
wonderful
;
had
made
out
,
he
was
sure
,
the
half-dozen
other
`
men
who
*NL*
were
distinguished
,
the
artists
,
the
critics
and
oh
the
great
*NL*
dramatist
--
HIM
it
was
easy
to
spot
;
but
wanted
--
no
,
thanks
,
really
--
to
*NL*
talk
with
none
of
them
;
having
nothing
at
all
to
say
and
finding
it
*NL*
would
do
beautifully
as
it
was
;
do
beautifully
because
what
it
*NL*
was
--
well
,
was
just
simply
too
late
.
And
when
after
this
little
Bilham
,
*NL*
submissive
and
responsive
,
but
with
an
eye
to
the
consolation
nearest
,
*NL*
easily
threw
off
some
``
Better
late
than
never
!
''
all
he
got
in
return
*NL*
for
it
was
a
sharp
``
Better
early
than
late
!
''
This
note
indeed
the
next
*NL*
thing
overflowed
for
Strether
into
a
quiet
stream
of
demonstration
that
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
had
let
himself
go
he
felt
as
the
real
relief
.
It
had
*NL*
consciously
gathered
to
a
head
,
but
the
reservoir
had
filled
sooner
*NL*
than
he
knew
,
and
his
companion
's
touch
was
to
make
the
waters
spread
.
*NL*
There
were
some
things
that
had
to
come
in
time
if
they
were
to
come
at
*NL*
all
.
If
they
did
n't
come
in
time
they
were
lost
for
ever
.
It
was
the
*NL*
general
sense
of
them
that
had
overwhelmed
him
with
its
long
slow
rush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
too
late
for
YOU
,
on
any
side
,
and
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
in
*NL*
danger
of
missing
the
train
;
besides
which
people
can
be
in
general
*NL*
pretty
well
trusted
,
of
course
--
with
the
clock
of
their
freedom
ticking
*NL*
as
loud
as
it
seems
to
do
here
--
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
fleeting
hour
.
*NL*
All
the
same
do
n't
forget
that
you
're
young
--
blessedly
young
;
be
glad
*NL*
of
it
on
the
contrary
and
live
up
to
it
.
Live
all
you
can
;
it
's
a
*NL*
mistake
not
to
.
It
does
n't
so
much
matter
what
you
do
in
particular
,
*NL*
so
long
as
you
have
your
life
.
If
you
have
n't
had
that
what
HAVE
you
*NL*
had
?
This
place
and
these
impressions
--
mild
as
you
may
find
them
to
*NL*
wind
a
man
up
so
;
all
my
impressions
of
Chad
and
of
people
I
've
seen
at
*NL*
HIS
place
--
well
,
have
had
their
abundant
message
for
me
,
have
just
*NL*
dropped
THAT
into
my
mind
.
I
see
it
now
.
I
have
n't
done
so
enough
*NL*
before
--
and
now
I
'm
old
;
too
old
at
any
rate
for
what
I
see
.
Oh
I
DO
*NL*
see
,
at
least
;
and
more
than
you
'd
believe
or
I
can
express
.
It
's
too
*NL*
late
.
And
it
's
as
if
the
train
had
fairly
waited
at
the
station
for
me
*NL*
without
my
having
had
the
gumption
to
know
it
was
there
.
Now
I
hear
its
*NL*
faint
receding
whistle
miles
and
miles
down
the
line
.
What
one
loses
*NL*
one
loses
;
make
no
mistake
about
that
.
The
affair
--
I
mean
the
affair
*NL*
of
life
--
could
n't
,
no
doubt
,
have
been
different
for
me
;
for
it
's
at
*NL*
the
best
a
tin
mould
,
either
fluted
and
embossed
,
with
ornamental
*NL*
excrescences
,
or
else
smooth
and
dreadfully
plain
,
into
which
,
a
*NL*
helpless
jelly
,
one
's
consciousness
is
poured
--
so
that
one
`
takes
'
the
*NL*
form
as
the
great
cook
says
,
and
is
more
or
less
compactly
held
by
it
:
*NL*
one
lives
in
fine
as
one
can
.
Still
,
one
has
the
illusion
of
freedom
;
*NL*
therefore
do
n't
be
,
like
me
,
without
the
memory
of
that
illusion
.
I
*NL*
was
either
,
at
the
right
time
,
too
stupid
or
too
intelligent
to
have
*NL*
it
;
I
do
n't
quite
know
which
.
Of
course
at
present
I
'm
a
case
of
*NL*
reaction
against
the
mistake
;
and
the
voice
of
reaction
should
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
always
be
taken
with
an
allowance
.
But
that
does
n't
affect
the
*NL*
point
that
the
right
time
is
now
yours
.
The
right
time
is
ANY
time
*NL*
that
one
is
still
so
lucky
as
to
have
.
You
've
plenty
;
that
's
the
great
*NL*
thing
;
you
're
,
as
I
say
,
damn
you
,
so
happily
and
hatefully
young
.
*NL*
Do
n't
at
any
rate
miss
things
out
of
stupidity
.
Of
course
I
do
n't
take
*NL*
you
for
a
fool
,
or
I
should
n't
be
addressing
you
thus
awfully
.
Do
what
*NL*
you
like
so
long
as
you
do
n't
make
MY
mistake
.
For
it
was
a
mistake
.
*NL*
Live
!
''
...
Slowly
and
sociably
,
with
full
pauses
and
straight
*NL*
dashes
,
Strether
had
so
delivered
himself
;
holding
little
Bilham
from
*NL*
step
to
step
deeply
and
gravely
attentive
.
The
end
of
all
was
that
the
*NL*
young
man
had
turned
quite
solemn
,
and
that
this
was
a
contradiction
of
*NL*
the
innocent
gaiety
the
speaker
had
wished
to
promote
.
He
watched
for
*NL*
a
moment
the
consequence
of
his
words
,
and
then
,
laying
a
hand
on
his
*NL*
listener
's
knee
and
as
if
to
end
with
the
proper
joke
:
``
And
now
for
*NL*
the
eye
I
shall
keep
on
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
do
n't
know
that
I
want
to
be
,
at
your
age
,
too
different
from
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
prepare
while
you
're
about
it
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
to
be
more
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
continued
to
think
,
but
at
last
had
a
smile
.
``
Well
,
you
*NL*
ARE
amusing
--
to
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impayable
,
as
you
say
,
no
doubt
.
But
what
am
I
to
myself
?
''
Strether
*NL*
had
risen
with
this
,
giving
his
attention
now
to
an
encounter
that
,
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
garden
,
was
in
the
act
of
taking
place
between
their
*NL*
host
and
the
lady
at
whose
side
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
quitted
him
.
This
*NL*
lady
,
who
appeared
within
a
few
minutes
to
have
left
her
friends
,
*NL*
awaited
Gloriani
's
eager
approach
with
words
on
her
lips
that
Strether
*NL*
could
n't
catch
,
but
of
which
her
interesting
witty
face
seemed
to
give
*NL*
him
the
echo
.
He
was
sure
she
was
prompt
and
fine
,
but
also
that
she
*NL*
had
met
her
match
,
and
he
liked
--
in
the
light
of
what
he
was
quite
sure
*NL*
was
the
Duchess
's
latent
insolence
--
the
good
humour
with
which
the
*NL*
great
artist
asserted
equal
resources
.
Were
they
,
this
pair
,
of
the
*NL*
``
great
world
''
?
--
and
was
he
himself
,
for
the
moment
and
thus
related
to
*NL*
them
by
his
observation
,
IN
it
?
Then
there
was
something
in
the
great
*NL*
world
covertly
tigerish
,
which
came
to
him
across
the
lawn
and
in
the
*NL*
charming
air
as
a
waft
from
the
jungle
.
Yet
it
made
him
admire
most
of
*NL*
the
two
,
made
him
envy
,
the
glossy
male
tiger
,
magnificently
marked
.
*NL*
These
absurdities
of
the
stirred
sense
,
fruits
of
suggestion
ripening
*NL*
on
the
instant
,
were
all
reflected
in
his
next
words
to
little
Bilham
.
*NL*
``
I
know
--
if
we
talk
of
that
--
whom
I
should
enjoy
being
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
followed
his
eyes
;
but
then
as
with
a
shade
of
knowing
*NL*
surprise
:
``
Gloriani
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
had
in
fact
already
hesitated
,
though
not
on
the
hint
of
his
*NL*
companion
's
doubt
,
in
which
there
were
depths
of
critical
reserve
.
He
*NL*
had
just
made
out
,
in
the
now
full
picture
,
something
and
somebody
*NL*
else
;
another
impression
had
been
superimposed
.
A
young
girl
in
a
*NL*
white
dress
and
a
softly
plumed
white
hat
had
suddenly
come
into
view
,
*NL*
and
what
was
presently
clear
was
that
her
course
was
toward
them
.
What
*NL*
was
clearer
still
was
that
the
handsome
young
man
at
her
side
was
Chad
*NL*
Newsome
,
and
what
was
clearest
of
all
was
that
she
was
therefore
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet
,
that
she
was
unmistakeably
pretty
--
bright
*NL*
gentle
shy
happy
wonderful
--
and
that
Chad
now
,
with
a
consummate
*NL*
calculation
of
effect
,
was
about
to
present
her
to
his
old
friend
's
*NL*
vision
.
What
was
clearest
of
all
indeed
was
something
much
more
than
*NL*
this
,
something
at
the
single
stroke
of
which
--
and
was
n't
it
simply
*NL*
juxtaposition
?
--
all
vagueness
vanished
.
It
was
the
click
of
a
*NL*
spring
--
he
saw
the
truth
.
He
had
by
this
time
also
met
Chad
's
look
;
*NL*
there
was
more
of
it
in
that
;
and
the
truth
,
accordingly
,
so
far
as
*NL*
Bilham
's
enquiry
was
concerned
,
had
thrust
in
the
answer
.
``
Oh
*NL*
Chad
!
''
--
it
was
that
rare
youth
he
should
have
enjoyed
being
``
like
.
''
The
*NL*
virtuous
attachment
would
be
all
there
before
him
;
the
virtuous
*NL*
attachment
would
be
in
the
very
act
of
appeal
for
his
blessing
;
Jeanne
*NL*
de
Vionnet
,
this
charming
creature
,
would
be
exquisitely
,
intensely
*NL*
now
--
the
object
of
it
.
Chad
brought
her
straight
up
to
him
,
and
Chad
*NL*
was
,
oh
yes
,
at
this
moment
--
for
the
glory
of
Woollett
or
*NL*
whatever
--
better
still
even
than
Gloriani
.
He
had
plucked
this
*NL*
blossom
;
he
had
kept
it
over-night
in
water
;
and
at
last
as
he
held
it
*NL*
up
to
wonder
he
did
enjoy
his
effect
.
That
was
why
Strether
had
felt
*NL*
at
first
the
breath
of
calculation
--
and
why
moreover
,
as
he
now
knew
,
*NL*
his
look
at
the
girl
would
be
,
for
the
young
man
,
a
sign
of
the
*NL*
latter
's
success
.
What
young
man
had
ever
paraded
about
that
way
,
*NL*
without
a
reason
,
a
maiden
in
her
flower
?
And
there
was
nothing
in
his
*NL*
reason
at
present
obscure
.
Her
type
sufficiently
told
of
it
--
they
*NL*
would
n't
,
they
could
n't
,
want
her
to
go
to
Woollett
.
Poor
Woollett
,
*NL*
and
what
it
might
miss
!
--
though
brave
Chad
indeed
too
,
and
what
it
*NL*
might
gain
!
Brave
Chad
however
had
just
excellently
spoken
.
``
This
is
a
*NL*
good
little
friend
of
mine
who
knows
all
about
you
and
has
moreover
a
*NL*
message
for
you
.
And
this
,
my
dear
''
--
he
had
turned
to
the
child
*NL*
herself
--
``
is
the
best
man
in
the
world
,
who
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
a
*NL*
great
deal
for
us
and
whom
I
want
you
to
like
and
revere
as
nearly
as
*NL*
possible
as
much
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
there
quite
pink
,
a
little
frightened
,
prettier
and
prettier
*NL*
and
not
a
bit
like
her
mother
.
There
was
in
this
last
particular
no
*NL*
resemblance
but
that
of
youth
to
youth
;
and
here
was
in
fact
suddenly
*NL*
Strether
's
sharpest
impression
.
It
went
wondering
,
dazed
,
embarrassed
,
*NL*
back
to
the
woman
he
had
just
been
talking
with
;
it
was
a
revelation
in
*NL*
the
light
of
which
he
already
saw
she
would
become
more
interesting
.
So
*NL*
slim
and
fresh
and
fair
,
she
had
yet
put
forth
this
perfection
;
so
that
*NL*
for
really
believing
it
of
her
,
for
seeing
her
to
any
such
developed
*NL*
degree
as
a
mother
,
comparison
would
be
urgent
.
Well
,
what
was
it
now
*NL*
but
fairly
thrust
upon
him
?
``
Mamma
wishes
me
to
tell
you
before
we
*NL*
go
,
''
the
girl
said
,
``
that
she
hopes
very
much
you
'll
come
to
see
us
*NL*
very
soon
.
She
has
something
important
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
quite
reproaches
herself
,
''
Chad
helpfully
explained
:
``
you
were
*NL*
interesting
her
so
much
when
she
accidentally
suffered
you
to
be
*NL*
interrupted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
do
n't
mention
it
!
''
Strether
murmured
,
looking
kindly
from
one
to
*NL*
the
other
and
wondering
at
many
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
to
ask
you
for
myself
,
''
Jeanne
continued
with
her
hands
*NL*
clasped
together
as
if
in
some
small
learnt
prayer
--
``
I
'm
to
ask
you
for
*NL*
myself
if
you
wo
n't
positively
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
it
to
me
,
dear
--
I
'll
take
care
of
it
!
''
Chad
genially
declared
in
*NL*
answer
to
this
,
while
Strether
himself
almost
held
his
breath
.
What
*NL*
was
in
the
girl
was
indeed
too
soft
,
too
unknown
for
direct
dealing
;
so
*NL*
that
one
could
only
gaze
at
it
as
at
a
picture
,
quite
staying
one
's
own
*NL*
hand
.
But
with
Chad
he
was
now
on
ground
--
Chad
he
could
meet
;
so
*NL*
pleasant
a
confidence
in
that
and
in
everything
did
the
young
man
*NL*
freely
exhale
.
There
was
the
whole
of
a
story
in
his
tone
to
his
*NL*
companion
,
and
he
spoke
indeed
as
if
already
of
the
family
.
It
made
*NL*
Strether
guess
the
more
quickly
what
it
might
be
about
which
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
was
so
urgent
.
Having
seen
him
then
she
had
found
him
easy
;
*NL*
she
wished
to
have
it
out
with
him
that
some
way
for
the
young
people
*NL*
must
be
discovered
,
some
way
that
would
not
impose
as
a
condition
the
*NL*
transplantation
of
her
daughter
.
He
already
saw
himself
discussing
*NL*
with
this
lady
the
attractions
of
Woollett
as
a
residence
for
Chad
's
*NL*
companion
.
Was
that
youth
going
now
to
trust
her
with
the
affair
--
so
*NL*
that
it
would
be
after
all
with
one
of
his
``
lady-friends
''
that
his
*NL*
mother
's
missionary
should
be
condemned
to
deal
?
It
was
quite
as
if
*NL*
for
an
instant
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
on
this
question
.
But
*NL*
there
was
no
mistaking
at
last
Chad
's
pride
in
the
display
of
such
a
*NL*
connexion
.
This
was
what
had
made
him
so
carry
himself
while
,
three
*NL*
minutes
before
,
he
was
bringing
it
into
view
;
what
had
caused
his
*NL*
friend
,
first
catching
sight
of
him
,
to
be
so
struck
with
his
air
.
It
*NL*
was
,
in
a
word
,
just
when
he
thus
finally
felt
Chad
putting
things
*NL*
straight
off
on
him
that
he
envied
him
,
as
he
had
mentioned
to
little
*NL*
Bilham
,
most
.
The
whole
exhibition
however
was
but
a
matter
of
three
*NL*
or
four
minutes
,
and
the
author
of
it
had
soon
explained
that
,
as
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
was
immediately
going
``
on
,
''
this
could
be
for
Jeanne
*NL*
but
a
snatch
.
They
would
all
meet
again
soon
,
and
Strether
was
*NL*
meanwhile
to
stay
and
amuse
himself
--
``
I
'll
pick
you
up
again
in
plenty
*NL*
of
time
.
''
He
took
the
girl
off
as
he
had
brought
her
,
and
Strether
,
*NL*
with
the
faint
sweet
foreignness
of
her
``
Au
revoir
,
monsieur
!
''
in
his
*NL*
ears
as
a
note
almost
unprecedented
,
watched
them
recede
side
by
side
*NL*
and
felt
how
,
once
more
,
her
companion
's
relation
to
her
got
an
accent
*NL*
from
it
.
They
disappeared
among
the
others
and
apparently
into
the
*NL*
house
;
whereupon
our
friend
turned
round
to
give
out
to
little
Bilham
*NL*
the
conviction
of
which
he
was
full
.
But
there
was
no
little
Bilham
*NL*
any
more
;
little
Bilham
had
within
the
few
moments
,
for
reasons
of
his
*NL*
own
,
proceeded
further
:
a
circumstance
by
which
,
in
its
order
,
*NL*
Strether
was
also
sensibly
affected
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
was
not
in
fact
on
this
occasion
to
keep
his
promise
of
coming
*NL*
back
;
but
Miss
Gostrey
had
soon
presented
herself
with
an
explanation
*NL*
of
his
failure
.
There
had
been
reasons
at
the
last
for
his
going
off
*NL*
with
ces
dames
;
and
he
had
asked
her
with
much
instance
to
come
out
and
*NL*
take
charge
of
their
friend
.
She
did
so
,
Strether
felt
as
she
took
her
*NL*
place
beside
him
,
in
a
manner
that
left
nothing
to
desire
.
He
had
*NL*
dropped
back
on
his
bench
,
alone
again
for
a
time
,
and
the
more
*NL*
conscious
for
little
Bilham
's
defection
of
his
unexpressed
thought
;
in
*NL*
respect
to
which
however
this
next
converser
was
a
still
more
capacious
*NL*
vessel
.
``
It
's
the
child
!
''
he
had
exclaimed
to
her
almost
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
appeared
;
and
though
her
direct
response
was
for
some
time
delayed
*NL*
he
could
feel
in
her
meanwhile
the
working
of
this
truth
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
simply
,
as
she
waited
,
that
they
were
now
in
presence
*NL*
altogether
of
truth
spreading
like
a
flood
and
not
for
the
moment
to
be
*NL*
offered
her
in
the
mere
cupful
;
inasmuch
as
who
should
ces
dames
prove
*NL*
to
be
but
persons
about
whom
--
once
thus
face
to
face
with
them
--
she
*NL*
found
she
might
from
the
first
have
told
him
almost
everything
?
This
*NL*
would
have
freely
come
had
he
taken
the
simple
precaution
of
giving
her
*NL*
their
name
.
There
could
be
no
better
example
--
and
she
appeared
to
note
*NL*
it
with
high
amusement
--
than
the
way
,
making
things
out
already
so
much
*NL*
for
himself
,
he
was
at
last
throwing
precautions
to
the
winds
.
They
*NL*
were
neither
more
nor
less
,
she
and
the
child
's
mother
,
than
old
*NL*
school-friends
--
friends
who
had
scarcely
met
for
years
but
whom
this
*NL*
unlooked-for
chance
had
brought
together
with
a
rush
.
It
was
a
relief
,
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
hinted
,
to
feel
herself
no
longer
groping
;
she
was
*NL*
unaccustomed
to
grope
and
as
a
general
thing
,
he
might
well
have
seen
,
*NL*
made
straight
enough
for
her
clue
.
With
the
one
she
had
now
picked
up
*NL*
in
her
hands
there
need
be
at
least
no
waste
of
wonder
.
``
She
's
coming
*NL*
to
see
me
--
that
's
for
YOU
,
''
Strether
's
counsellor
continued
;
``
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
require
it
to
know
where
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waste
of
wonder
might
be
proscribed
;
but
Strether
,
*NL*
characteristically
,
was
even
by
this
time
in
the
immensity
of
space
.
*NL*
``
By
which
you
mean
that
you
know
where
SHE
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
hesitated
.
``
I
mean
that
if
she
comes
to
see
me
I
shall
--
now
*NL*
that
I
've
pulled
myself
round
a
bit
after
the
shock
--
not
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hung
poised
.
``
You
call
it
--
your
recognition
--
a
shock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
one
of
her
rare
flickers
of
impatience
.
``
It
was
a
surprise
,
*NL*
an
emotion
.
Do
n't
be
so
literal
.
I
wash
my
hands
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Strether
's
face
lengthened
.
``
She
's
impossible
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
even
more
charming
than
I
remembered
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
to
think
how
to
put
it
.
``
Well
,
I
'M
impossible
.
It
's
*NL*
impossible
.
Everything
's
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
an
instant
.
``
I
see
where
you
're
coming
out
.
*NL*
Everything
's
possible
.
''
Their
eyes
had
on
it
in
fact
an
exchange
of
*NL*
some
duration
;
after
which
he
pursued
:
``
Is
n't
it
that
beautiful
*NL*
child
?
''
Then
as
she
still
said
nothing
:
``
Why
do
n't
you
mean
to
receive
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
answer
in
an
instant
rang
clear
.
``
Because
I
wish
to
keep
out
of
*NL*
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
provoked
in
him
a
weak
wail
.
``
You
're
going
to
abandon
me
NOW
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
only
going
to
abandon
HER
.
She
'll
want
me
to
help
her
with
*NL*
you
.
And
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
only
help
me
with
her
?
Well
then
--
!
''
Most
of
the
persons
*NL*
previously
gathered
had
,
in
the
interest
of
tea
,
passed
into
the
house
,
*NL*
and
they
had
the
gardens
mainly
to
themselves
.
The
shadows
were
long
,
*NL*
the
last
call
of
the
birds
,
who
had
made
a
home
of
their
own
in
the
*NL*
noble
interspaced
quarter
,
sounded
from
the
high
trees
in
the
other
*NL*
gardens
as
well
,
those
of
the
old
convent
and
of
the
old
hotels
;
it
was
*NL*
as
if
our
friends
had
waited
for
the
full
charm
to
come
out
.
Strether
's
*NL*
impressions
were
still
present
;
it
was
as
if
something
had
happened
*NL*
that
``
nailed
''
them
,
made
them
more
intense
;
but
he
was
to
ask
himself
*NL*
soon
afterwards
,
that
evening
,
what
really
HAD
happened
--
conscious
as
*NL*
he
could
after
all
remain
that
for
a
gentleman
taken
,
and
taken
the
*NL*
first
time
,
into
the
``
great
world
,
''
the
world
of
ambassadors
and
*NL*
duchesses
,
the
items
made
a
meagre
total
.
It
was
nothing
new
to
him
,
*NL*
however
,
as
we
know
,
that
a
man
might
have
--
at
all
events
such
a
man
as
*NL*
he
--
an
amount
of
experience
out
of
any
proportion
to
his
adventures
;
so
*NL*
that
,
though
it
was
doubtless
no
great
adventure
to
sit
on
there
with
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
and
hear
about
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
the
hour
,
the
picture
,
*NL*
the
immediate
,
the
recent
,
the
possible
--
as
well
as
the
communication
*NL*
itself
,
not
a
note
of
which
failed
to
reverberate
--
only
gave
the
*NL*
moments
more
of
the
taste
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
history
,
to
begin
with
,
that
Jeanne
's
mother
had
been
*NL*
three-and-twenty
years
before
,
at
Geneva
,
schoolmate
and
good
*NL*
girlfriend
to
Maria
Gostrey
,
who
had
moreover
enjoyed
since
then
,
*NL*
though
interruptedly
and
above
all
with
a
long
recent
drop
,
other
*NL*
glimpses
of
her
.
Twenty-three
years
put
them
both
on
,
no
doubt
;
and
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
--
though
she
had
married
straight
after
*NL*
school
--
could
n't
be
today
an
hour
less
than
thirty-eight
.
This
made
her
*NL*
ten
years
older
than
Chad
--
though
ten
years
,
also
,
if
Strether
liked
,
*NL*
older
than
she
looked
;
the
least
,
at
any
rate
,
that
a
prospective
*NL*
mother-in-law
could
be
expected
to
do
with
.
She
would
be
of
all
*NL*
mothers-in-law
the
most
charming
;
unless
indeed
,
through
some
*NL*
perversity
as
yet
insupposeable
,
she
should
utterly
belie
herself
in
*NL*
that
relation
.
There
was
none
surely
in
which
,
as
Maria
remembered
*NL*
her
,
she
must
n't
be
charming
;
and
this
frankly
in
spite
of
the
stigma
*NL*
of
failure
in
the
tie
where
failure
always
most
showed
.
It
was
no
test
*NL*
there
--
when
indeed
WAS
it
a
test
there
?
--
for
Monsieur
de
Vionnet
had
*NL*
been
a
brute
.
She
had
lived
for
years
apart
from
him
--
which
was
of
*NL*
course
always
a
horrid
position
;
but
Miss
Gostrey
's
impression
of
the
*NL*
matter
had
been
that
she
could
scarce
have
made
a
better
thing
of
it
*NL*
had
she
done
it
on
purpose
to
show
she
was
amiable
.
She
was
so
amiable
*NL*
that
nobody
had
had
a
word
to
say
;
which
was
luckily
not
the
case
for
*NL*
her
husband
.
He
was
so
impossible
that
she
had
the
advantage
of
all
*NL*
her
merits
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
history
for
Strether
that
the
Comte
de
Vionnet
--
it
being
*NL*
also
history
that
the
lady
in
question
was
a
Countess
--
should
now
,
*NL*
under
Miss
Gostrey
's
sharp
touch
,
rise
before
him
as
a
high
*NL*
distinguished
polished
impertinent
reprobate
,
the
product
of
a
*NL*
mysterious
order
;
it
was
history
,
further
,
that
the
charming
girl
so
*NL*
freely
sketched
by
his
companion
should
have
been
married
out
of
hand
*NL*
by
a
mother
,
another
figure
of
striking
outline
,
full
of
dark
personal
*NL*
motive
;
it
was
perhaps
history
most
of
all
that
this
company
was
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
,
governed
by
such
considerations
as
put
divorce
out
of
*NL*
the
question
.
``
Ces
gens-la
do
n't
divorce
,
you
know
,
any
more
than
they
*NL*
emigrate
or
abjure
--
they
think
it
impious
and
vulgar
''
;
a
fact
in
the
*NL*
light
of
which
they
seemed
but
the
more
richly
special
.
It
was
all
*NL*
special
;
it
was
all
,
for
Strether
's
imagination
,
more
or
less
rich
.
The
*NL*
girl
at
the
Genevese
school
,
an
isolated
interesting
attaching
*NL*
creature
,
then
both
sensitive
and
violent
,
audacious
but
always
*NL*
forgiven
,
was
the
daughter
of
a
French
father
and
an
English
mother
*NL*
who
,
early
left
a
widow
,
had
married
again
--
tried
afresh
with
a
*NL*
foreigner
;
in
her
career
with
whom
she
had
apparently
given
her
child
*NL*
no
example
of
comfort
.
All
these
people
--
the
people
of
the
English
*NL*
mother
's
side
--
had
been
of
condition
more
or
less
eminent
;
yet
with
*NL*
oddities
and
disparities
that
had
often
since
made
Maria
,
thinking
them
*NL*
over
,
wonder
what
they
really
quite
rhymed
to
.
It
was
in
any
case
her
*NL*
belief
that
the
mother
,
interested
and
prone
to
adventure
,
had
been
*NL*
without
conscience
,
had
only
thought
of
ridding
herself
most
quickly
of
*NL*
a
possible
,
an
actual
encumbrance
.
The
father
,
by
her
impression
,
a
*NL*
Frenchman
with
a
name
one
knew
,
had
been
a
different
matter
,
leaving
*NL*
his
child
,
she
clearly
recalled
,
a
memory
all
fondness
,
as
well
as
an
*NL*
assured
little
fortune
which
was
unluckily
to
make
her
more
or
less
of
*NL*
a
prey
later
on
.
She
had
been
in
particular
,
at
school
,
dazzlingly
,
*NL*
though
quite
booklessly
,
clever
;
as
polyglot
as
a
little
Jewess
-LRB-
which
*NL*
she
was
n't
,
oh
no
!
-RRB-
and
chattering
French
,
English
,
German
,
Italian
,
*NL*
anything
one
would
,
in
a
way
that
made
a
clean
sweep
,
if
not
of
prizes
*NL*
and
parchments
,
at
least
of
every
``
part
,
''
whether
memorised
or
*NL*
improvised
,
in
the
curtained
costumed
school
repertory
,
and
in
especial
*NL*
of
all
mysteries
of
race
and
vagueness
of
reference
,
all
swagger
about
*NL*
``
home
,
''
among
their
variegated
mates
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
doubtless
be
difficult
to-day
,
as
between
French
and
English
,
*NL*
to
name
her
and
place
her
;
she
would
certainly
show
,
on
knowledge
,
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
felt
,
as
one
of
those
convenient
types
who
do
n't
keep
you
*NL*
explaining
--
minds
with
doors
as
numerous
as
the
many-tongued
cluster
of
*NL*
confessionals
at
Saint
Peter
's
.
You
might
confess
to
her
with
*NL*
confidence
in
Roumelian
,
and
even
Roumelian
sins
.
Therefore
--
!
But
*NL*
Strether
's
narrator
covered
her
implication
with
a
laugh
;
a
laugh
by
*NL*
which
his
betrayal
of
a
sense
of
the
lurid
in
the
picture
was
also
*NL*
perhaps
sufficiently
protected
.
He
had
a
moment
of
wondering
,
while
*NL*
his
friend
went
on
,
what
sins
might
be
especially
Roumelian
.
She
went
*NL*
on
at
all
events
to
the
mention
of
her
having
met
the
young
*NL*
thing
--
again
by
some
Swiss
lake
--
in
her
first
married
state
,
which
had
*NL*
appeared
for
the
few
intermediate
years
not
at
least
violently
*NL*
disturbed
.
She
had
been
lovely
at
that
moment
,
delightful
to
HER
,
full
*NL*
of
responsive
emotion
,
of
amused
recognitions
and
amusing
reminders
,
*NL*
and
then
once
more
,
much
later
,
after
a
long
interval
,
equally
but
*NL*
differently
charming
--
touching
and
rather
mystifying
for
the
five
*NL*
minutes
of
an
encounter
at
a
railway-station
en
province
,
during
which
*NL*
it
had
come
out
that
her
life
was
all
changed
.
Miss
Gostrey
had
*NL*
understood
enough
to
see
,
essentially
,
what
had
happened
,
and
yet
had
*NL*
beautifully
dreamed
that
she
was
herself
faultless
.
There
were
*NL*
doubtless
depths
in
her
,
but
she
was
all
right
;
Strether
would
see
if
*NL*
she
was
n't
.
She
was
another
person
however
--
that
had
been
promptly
*NL*
marked
--
from
the
small
child
of
nature
at
the
Geneva
school
,
a
little
*NL*
person
quite
made
over
-LRB-
as
foreign
women
WERE
,
compared
with
American
-RRB-
*NL*
by
marriage
.
Her
situation
too
had
evidently
cleared
itself
up
;
there
*NL*
would
have
been
--
all
that
was
possible
--
a
judicial
separation
.
She
had
*NL*
settled
in
Paris
,
brought
up
her
daughter
,
steered
her
boat
.
It
was
no
*NL*
very
pleasant
boat
--
especially
there
--
to
be
in
;
but
Marie
de
Vionnet
*NL*
would
have
headed
straight
.
She
would
have
friends
,
certainly
--
and
*NL*
very
good
ones
.
There
she
was
at
all
events
--
and
it
was
very
*NL*
interesting
.
Her
knowing
Mr.
Chad
did
n't
in
the
least
prove
she
had
n't
*NL*
friends
;
what
it
proved
was
what
good
ones
HE
had
.
``
I
saw
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
,
``
that
night
at
the
Francais
;
it
came
out
for
me
in
three
*NL*
minutes
.
I
saw
HER
--
or
somebody
like
her
.
And
so
,
''
she
immediately
*NL*
added
,
``
did
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
not
anybody
like
her
!
''
Strether
laughed
.
``
But
you
mean
,
''
he
as
*NL*
promptly
went
on
,
``
that
she
has
had
such
an
influence
on
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
was
on
her
feet
;
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
.
``
She
has
*NL*
brought
him
up
for
her
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
,
as
so
often
,
in
candid
conference
,
through
their
settled
*NL*
glasses
,
met
over
it
long
;
after
which
Strether
's
again
took
in
the
*NL*
whole
place
.
They
were
quite
alone
there
now
.
``
Must
n't
she
rather
--
in
*NL*
the
time
then
--
have
rushed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
she
wo
n't
of
course
have
lost
an
hour
.
But
that
's
just
the
good
*NL*
mother
--
the
good
French
one
.
You
must
remember
that
of
her
--
that
as
a
*NL*
mother
she
's
French
,
and
that
for
them
there
's
a
special
providence
.
It
*NL*
precisely
however
--
that
she
may
n't
have
been
able
to
begin
as
far
back
*NL*
as
she
'd
have
liked
--
makes
her
grateful
for
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
this
in
as
they
slowly
moved
to
the
house
on
their
way
*NL*
out
.
``
She
counts
on
me
then
to
put
the
thing
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
she
counts
on
you
.
Oh
and
first
of
all
of
course
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
*NL*
added
,
``
on
her
--
well
,
convincing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
her
friend
returned
,
``
she
caught
Chad
young
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
there
are
women
who
are
for
all
your
`
times
of
life
.
'
They
're
*NL*
the
most
wonderful
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
laughed
the
words
out
,
but
they
brought
her
companion
,
the
next
*NL*
thing
,
to
a
stand
.
``
Is
what
you
mean
that
she
'll
try
to
make
a
fool
of
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
wondering
what
she
WILL
--
with
an
opportunity
--
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
an
opportunity
?
My
going
to
see
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
you
must
go
to
see
her
''
--
Miss
Gostrey
was
a
trifle
evasive
.
``
You
*NL*
ca
n't
not
do
that
.
You
'd
have
gone
to
see
the
other
woman
.
I
mean
if
*NL*
there
had
been
one
--
a
different
sort
.
It
's
what
you
came
out
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
;
but
Strether
distinguished
.
``
I
did
n't
come
out
to
see
*NL*
THIS
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
wonderful
look
at
him
now
.
``
Are
you
disappointed
she
is
n't
*NL*
worse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
for
a
moment
entertained
the
question
,
then
found
for
it
the
*NL*
frankest
of
answers
.
``
Yes
.
If
she
were
worse
she
'd
be
better
for
our
*NL*
purpose
.
It
would
be
simpler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
she
admitted
.
``
But
wo
n't
this
be
pleasanter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
you
know
,
''
he
promptly
replied
,
``
I
did
n't
come
out
--
was
n't
that
*NL*
just
what
you
originally
reproached
me
with
?
--
for
the
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
Therefore
I
say
again
what
I
said
at
first
.
You
must
take
*NL*
things
as
they
come
.
Besides
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
added
,
``
I
'm
not
afraid
for
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
yourself
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
your
seeing
her
.
I
trust
her
.
There
's
nothing
she
'll
say
about
*NL*
me
.
In
fact
there
's
nothing
she
CAN
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
--
little
as
he
had
thought
of
this
.
Then
he
broke
*NL*
out
.
``
Oh
you
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
it
at
which
she
flushed
.
``
Yes
--
there
we
are
.
*NL*
We
're
abysses
.
''
At
last
she
smiled
.
``
But
I
risk
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
himself
a
shake
.
``
Well
then
so
do
I
!
''
But
he
added
as
they
*NL*
passed
into
the
house
that
he
would
see
Chad
the
first
thing
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
next
day
the
more
easily
effected
that
the
young
man
,
as
*NL*
it
happened
,
even
before
he
was
down
,
turned
up
at
his
hotel
.
Strether
*NL*
took
his
coffee
,
by
habit
,
in
the
public
room
;
but
on
his
descending
*NL*
for
this
purpose
Chad
instantly
proposed
an
adjournment
to
what
he
*NL*
called
greater
privacy
.
He
had
himself
as
yet
had
nothing
--
they
would
*NL*
sit
down
somewhere
together
;
and
when
after
a
few
steps
and
a
turn
into
*NL*
the
Boulevard
they
had
,
for
their
greater
privacy
,
sat
down
among
*NL*
twenty
others
,
our
friend
saw
in
his
companion
's
move
a
fear
of
the
*NL*
advent
of
Waymarsh
.
It
was
the
first
time
Chad
had
to
that
extent
*NL*
given
this
personage
``
away
''
;
and
Strether
found
himself
wondering
of
*NL*
what
it
was
symptomatic
.
He
made
out
in
a
moment
that
the
youth
was
in
*NL*
earnest
as
he
had
n't
yet
seen
him
;
which
in
its
turn
threw
a
ray
*NL*
perhaps
a
trifle
startling
on
what
they
had
each
up
to
that
time
been
*NL*
treating
as
earnestness
.
It
was
sufficiently
flattering
however
that
*NL*
the
real
thing
--
if
this
WAS
at
last
the
real
thing
--
should
have
been
*NL*
determined
,
as
appeared
,
precisely
by
an
accretion
of
Strether
's
*NL*
importance
.
For
this
was
what
it
quickly
enough
came
to
--
that
Chad
,
*NL*
rising
with
the
lark
,
had
rushed
down
to
let
him
know
while
his
morning
*NL*
consciousness
was
yet
young
that
he
had
literally
made
the
afternoon
*NL*
before
a
tremendous
impression
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
would
n't
,
could
n't
*NL*
rest
till
she
should
have
some
assurance
from
him
that
he
WOULD
consent
*NL*
again
to
see
her
.
The
announcement
was
made
,
across
their
*NL*
marble-topped
table
,
while
the
foam
of
the
hot
milk
was
in
their
cups
*NL*
and
its
plash
still
in
the
air
,
with
the
smile
of
Chad
's
easiest
*NL*
urbanity
;
and
this
expression
of
his
face
caused
our
friend
's
doubts
to
*NL*
gather
on
the
spot
into
a
challenge
of
the
lips
.
``
See
here
''
--
that
was
*NL*
all
;
he
only
for
the
moment
said
again
``
See
here
.
''
Chad
met
it
with
all
*NL*
his
air
of
straight
intelligence
,
while
Strether
remembered
again
that
*NL*
fancy
of
the
first
impression
of
him
,
the
happy
young
Pagan
,
handsome
*NL*
and
hard
but
oddly
indulgent
,
whose
mysterious
measure
he
had
under
the
*NL*
street-lamp
tried
mentally
to
take
.
The
young
Pagan
,
while
a
long
look
*NL*
passed
between
them
,
sufficiently
understood
.
Strether
scarce
needed
*NL*
at
last
to
say
the
rest
--
``
I
want
to
know
where
I
am
.
''
But
he
said
it
,
*NL*
adding
before
any
answer
something
more
.
``
Are
you
engaged
to
be
*NL*
married
--
is
that
your
secret
?
--
to
the
young
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
shook
his
head
with
the
slow
amenity
that
was
one
of
his
ways
of
*NL*
conveying
that
there
was
time
for
everything
.
``
I
have
no
*NL*
secret
--
though
I
may
have
secrets
!
I
have
n't
at
any
rate
that
one
.
*NL*
We
're
not
engaged
.
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
where
's
the
hitch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
why
I
have
n't
already
started
with
you
?
''
Chad
,
beginning
*NL*
his
coffee
and
buttering
his
roll
,
was
quite
ready
to
explain
.
``
Nothing
*NL*
would
have
induced
me
--
nothing
will
still
induce
me
--
not
to
try
to
keep
*NL*
you
here
as
long
as
you
can
be
made
to
stay
.
It
's
too
visibly
good
for
*NL*
you
.
''
Strether
had
himself
plenty
to
say
about
this
,
but
it
was
amusing
*NL*
also
to
measure
the
march
of
Chad
's
tone
.
He
had
never
been
more
a
man
*NL*
of
the
world
,
and
it
was
always
in
his
company
present
to
our
friend
*NL*
that
one
was
seeing
how
in
successive
connexions
a
man
of
the
world
*NL*
acquitted
himself
.
Chad
kept
it
up
beautifully
.
``
My
idea
--
voyons
!
--
is
*NL*
simply
that
you
should
let
Madame
de
Vionnet
know
you
,
simply
that
you
*NL*
should
consent
to
know
HER
.
I
do
n't
in
the
least
mind
telling
you
*NL*
that
,
clever
and
charming
as
she
is
,
she
's
ever
so
much
in
my
*NL*
confidence
.
All
I
ask
of
you
is
to
let
her
talk
to
you
.
You
've
asked
me
*NL*
about
what
you
call
my
hitch
,
and
so
far
as
it
goes
she
'll
explain
it
*NL*
to
you
.
She
's
herself
my
hitch
,
hang
it
--
if
you
must
really
have
it
*NL*
all
out
.
But
in
a
sense
,
''
he
hastened
in
the
most
wonderful
manner
to
*NL*
add
,
``
that
you
'll
quite
make
out
for
yourself
.
She
's
too
good
a
friend
,
*NL*
confound
her
.
Too
good
,
I
mean
,
for
me
to
leave
without
--
without
--
''
It
*NL*
was
his
first
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
without
my
arranging
somehow
or
other
the
damnable
terms
of
my
*NL*
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
WILL
be
a
sacrifice
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
the
greatest
loss
I
ever
suffered
.
I
owe
her
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beautiful
,
the
way
Chad
said
these
things
,
and
his
plea
was
now
*NL*
confessedly
--
oh
quite
flagrantly
and
publicly
--
interesting
.
The
moment
*NL*
really
took
on
for
Strether
an
intensity
.
Chad
owed
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
so
much
?
What
DID
that
do
then
but
clear
up
the
whole
mystery
?
He
was
*NL*
indebted
for
alterations
,
and
she
was
thereby
in
a
position
to
have
*NL*
sent
in
her
bill
for
expenses
incurred
in
reconstruction
.
What
was
*NL*
this
at
bottom
but
what
had
been
to
be
arrived
at
?
Strether
sat
there
*NL*
arriving
at
it
while
he
munched
toast
and
stirred
his
second
cup
.
To
*NL*
do
this
with
the
aid
of
Chad
's
pleasant
earnest
face
was
also
to
do
*NL*
more
besides
.
No
,
never
before
had
he
been
so
ready
to
take
him
as
he
*NL*
was
.
What
was
it
that
had
suddenly
so
cleared
up
?
It
was
just
*NL*
everybody
's
character
;
that
is
everybody
's
but
--
in
a
measure
--
his
own
.
*NL*
Strether
felt
HIS
character
receive
for
the
instant
a
smutch
from
all
*NL*
the
wrong
things
he
had
suspected
or
believed
.
The
person
to
whom
Chad
*NL*
owed
it
that
he
could
positively
turn
out
such
a
comfort
to
other
*NL*
persons
--
such
a
person
was
sufficiently
raised
above
any
``
breath
''
by
*NL*
the
nature
of
her
work
and
the
young
man
's
steady
light
.
All
of
which
*NL*
was
vivid
enough
to
come
and
go
quickly
;
though
indeed
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
it
Strether
could
utter
a
question
.
``
Have
I
your
word
of
honour
that
*NL*
if
I
surrender
myself
to
Madame
de
Vionnet
you
'll
surrender
yourself
to
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
laid
his
hand
firmly
on
his
friend
's
.
``
My
dear
man
,
you
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
finally
something
in
his
felicity
almost
embarrassing
and
*NL*
oppressive
--
Strether
had
begun
to
fidget
under
it
for
the
open
air
and
*NL*
the
erect
posture
.
He
had
signed
to
the
waiter
that
he
wished
to
pay
,
*NL*
and
this
transaction
took
some
moments
,
during
which
he
thoroughly
*NL*
felt
,
while
he
put
down
money
and
pretended
--
it
was
quite
hollow
--
to
*NL*
estimate
change
,
that
Chad
's
higher
spirit
,
his
youth
,
his
practice
,
*NL*
his
paganism
,
his
felicity
,
his
assurance
,
his
impudence
,
whatever
it
*NL*
might
be
,
had
consciously
scored
a
success
.
Well
,
that
was
all
right
so
*NL*
far
as
it
went
;
his
sense
of
the
thing
in
question
covered
our
friend
*NL*
for
a
minute
like
a
veil
through
which
--
as
if
he
had
been
muffled
--
he
*NL*
heard
his
interlocutor
ask
him
if
he
might
n't
take
him
over
about
five
.
*NL*
``
Over
''
was
over
the
river
,
and
over
the
river
was
where
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
lived
,
and
five
was
that
very
afternoon
.
They
got
at
last
out
*NL*
of
the
place
--
got
out
before
he
answered
.
He
lighted
,
in
the
street
,
a
*NL*
cigarette
,
which
again
gave
him
more
time
.
But
it
was
already
sharp
*NL*
for
him
that
there
was
no
use
in
time
.
``
What
does
she
propose
to
do
to
*NL*
me
?
''
he
had
presently
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
no
delays
.
``
Are
you
afraid
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
immensely
.
Do
n't
you
see
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
she
wo
n't
do
anything
worse
to
you
than
make
you
*NL*
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
of
that
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
not
fair
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
cast
about
.
``
It
's
fair
to
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
are
you
afraid
of
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scarcely
less
.
Or
perhaps
even
more
.
But
is
this
lady
against
your
*NL*
interests
at
home
?
''
Strether
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
directly
,
no
doubt
;
but
she
's
greatly
in
favour
of
them
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
--
`
here
'
--
does
she
consider
them
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
relations
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
it
that
makes
them
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Well
,
that
's
exactly
what
you
'll
make
out
if
you
'll
only
go
,
as
*NL*
I
'm
supplicating
you
,
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
stared
at
him
with
a
little
of
the
wanness
,
no
doubt
,
that
the
*NL*
vision
of
more
to
``
make
out
''
could
scarce
help
producing
.
``
I
mean
HOW
*NL*
good
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
awfully
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Strether
had
faltered
,
but
it
was
brief
.
It
was
all
very
well
,
*NL*
but
there
was
nothing
now
he
would
n't
risk
.
``
Excuse
me
,
but
I
must
*NL*
really
--
as
I
began
by
telling
you
--
know
where
I
am
.
Is
she
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bad
'
?
''
--
Chad
echoed
it
,
but
without
a
shock
.
``
Is
that
what
's
*NL*
implied
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
relations
are
good
?
''
Strether
felt
a
little
silly
,
and
was
even
*NL*
conscious
of
a
foolish
laugh
,
at
having
it
imposed
on
him
to
have
*NL*
appeared
to
speak
so
.
What
indeed
was
he
talking
about
?
His
stare
had
*NL*
relaxed
;
he
looked
now
all
round
him
.
But
something
in
him
brought
him
*NL*
back
,
though
he
still
did
n't
know
quite
how
to
turn
it
.
The
two
or
*NL*
three
ways
he
thought
of
,
and
one
of
them
in
particular
,
were
,
even
*NL*
with
scruples
dismissed
,
too
ugly
.
He
none
the
less
at
last
found
*NL*
something
.
``
Is
her
life
without
reproach
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
him
,
directly
he
had
found
it
,
as
pompous
and
priggish
;
so
*NL*
much
so
that
he
was
thankful
to
Chad
for
taking
it
only
in
the
right
*NL*
spirit
.
The
young
man
spoke
so
immensely
to
the
point
that
the
effect
*NL*
was
practically
of
positive
blandness
.
``
Absolutely
without
reproach
.
A
*NL*
beautiful
life
.
Allez
donc
voir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
words
were
,
in
the
liberality
of
their
confidence
,
so
*NL*
imperative
that
Strether
went
through
no
form
of
assent
;
but
before
*NL*
they
separated
it
had
been
confirmed
that
he
should
be
picked
up
at
a
*NL*
quarter
to
five
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Book
Sixth
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
by
half-past
five
--
after
the
two
men
had
been
together
in
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
drawing-room
not
more
than
a
dozen
minutes
--
that
*NL*
Chad
,
with
a
look
at
his
watch
and
then
another
at
their
hostess
,
said
*NL*
genially
,
gaily
:
``
I
've
an
engagement
,
and
I
know
you
wo
n't
complain
if
*NL*
I
leave
him
with
you
.
He
'll
interest
you
immensely
;
and
as
for
her
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
to
Strether
,
``
I
assure
you
,
if
you
're
at
all
nervous
,
she
's
*NL*
perfectly
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
left
them
to
be
embarrassed
or
not
by
this
guarantee
,
as
they
*NL*
could
best
manage
,
and
embarrassment
was
a
thing
that
Strether
was
n't
*NL*
at
first
sure
Madame
de
Vionnet
escaped
.
He
escaped
it
himself
,
to
his
*NL*
surprise
;
but
he
had
grown
used
by
this
time
to
thinking
of
himself
as
*NL*
brazen
.
She
occupied
,
his
hostess
,
in
the
Rue
de
Bellechasse
,
the
*NL*
first
floor
of
an
old
house
to
which
our
visitors
had
had
access
from
*NL*
an
old
clean
court
.
The
court
was
large
and
open
,
full
of
revelations
,
*NL*
for
our
friend
,
of
the
habit
of
privacy
,
the
peace
of
intervals
,
the
*NL*
dignity
of
distances
and
approaches
;
the
house
,
to
his
restless
sense
,
*NL*
was
in
the
high
homely
style
of
an
elder
day
,
and
the
ancient
Paris
*NL*
that
he
was
always
looking
for
--
sometimes
intensely
felt
,
sometimes
*NL*
more
acutely
missed
--
was
in
the
immemorial
polish
of
the
wide
waxed
*NL*
staircase
and
in
the
fine
boiseries
,
the
medallions
,
mouldings
,
*NL*
mirrors
,
great
clear
spaces
,
of
the
greyish-white
salon
into
which
he
*NL*
had
been
shown
.
He
seemed
at
the
very
outset
to
see
her
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
possessions
not
vulgarly
numerous
,
but
hereditary
cherished
*NL*
charming
.
While
his
eyes
turned
after
a
little
from
those
of
his
*NL*
hostess
and
Chad
freely
talked
--
not
in
the
least
about
HIM
,
but
about
*NL*
other
people
,
people
he
did
n't
know
,
and
quite
as
if
he
did
know
*NL*
them
--
he
found
himself
making
out
,
as
a
background
of
the
occupant
,
*NL*
some
glory
,
some
prosperity
of
the
First
Empire
,
some
Napoleonic
*NL*
glamour
,
some
dim
lustre
of
the
great
legend
;
elements
clinging
still
*NL*
to
all
the
consular
chairs
and
mythological
brasses
and
sphinxes
'
heads
*NL*
and
faded
surfaces
of
satin
striped
with
alternate
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
itself
went
further
back
--
that
he
guessed
,
and
how
old
Paris
*NL*
continued
in
a
manner
to
echo
there
;
but
the
post-revolutionary
period
,
*NL*
the
world
he
vaguely
thought
of
as
the
world
of
Chateaubriand
,
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Stael
,
even
of
the
young
Lamartine
,
had
left
its
stamp
of
*NL*
harps
and
urns
and
torches
,
a
stamp
impressed
on
sundry
small
objects
,
*NL*
ornaments
and
relics
.
He
had
never
before
,
to
his
knowledge
,
had
*NL*
present
to
him
relics
,
of
any
special
dignity
,
of
a
private
*NL*
order
--
little
old
miniatures
,
medallions
,
pictures
,
books
;
books
in
*NL*
leather
bindings
,
pinkish
and
greenish
,
with
gilt
garlands
on
the
back
,
*NL*
ranged
,
together
with
other
promiscuous
properties
,
under
the
glass
of
*NL*
brass-mounted
cabinets
.
His
attention
took
them
all
tenderly
into
*NL*
account
.
They
were
among
the
matters
that
marked
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
*NL*
apartment
as
something
quite
different
from
Miss
Gostrey
's
little
*NL*
museum
of
bargains
and
from
Chad
's
lovely
home
;
he
recognised
it
as
*NL*
founded
much
more
on
old
accumulations
that
had
possibly
from
time
to
*NL*
time
shrunken
than
on
any
contemporary
method
of
acquisition
or
form
of
*NL*
curiosity
.
Chad
and
Miss
Gostrey
had
rummaged
and
purchased
and
picked
*NL*
up
and
exchanged
,
sifting
,
selecting
,
comparing
;
whereas
the
mistress
*NL*
of
the
scene
before
him
,
beautifully
passive
under
the
spell
of
*NL*
transmission
--
transmission
from
her
father
's
line
,
he
quite
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
--
had
only
received
,
accepted
and
been
quiet
.
When
she
had
n't
been
*NL*
quiet
she
had
been
moved
at
the
most
to
some
occult
charity
for
some
*NL*
fallen
fortune
.
There
had
been
objects
she
or
her
predecessors
might
*NL*
even
conceivably
have
parted
with
under
need
,
but
Strether
could
n't
*NL*
suspect
them
of
having
sold
old
pieces
to
get
``
better
''
ones
.
They
*NL*
would
have
felt
no
difference
as
to
better
or
worse
.
He
could
but
*NL*
imagine
their
having
felt
--
perhaps
in
emigration
,
in
proscription
,
for
*NL*
his
sketch
was
slight
and
confused
--
the
pressure
of
want
or
the
*NL*
obligation
of
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pressure
of
want
--
whatever
might
be
the
case
with
the
other
*NL*
force
--
was
,
however
,
presumably
not
active
now
,
for
the
tokens
of
a
*NL*
chastened
ease
still
abounded
after
all
,
many
marks
of
a
taste
whose
*NL*
discriminations
might
perhaps
have
been
called
eccentric
.
He
guessed
*NL*
at
intense
little
preferences
and
sharp
little
exclusions
,
a
deep
*NL*
suspicion
of
the
vulgar
and
a
personal
view
of
the
right
.
The
general
*NL*
result
of
this
was
something
for
which
he
had
no
name
on
the
spot
quite
*NL*
ready
,
but
something
he
would
have
come
nearest
to
naming
in
speaking
*NL*
of
it
as
the
air
of
supreme
respectability
,
the
consciousness
,
small
,
*NL*
still
,
reserved
,
but
none
the
less
distinct
and
diffused
,
of
private
*NL*
honour
.
The
air
of
supreme
respectability
--
that
was
a
strange
blank
*NL*
wall
for
his
adventure
to
have
brought
him
to
break
his
nose
against
.
*NL*
It
had
in
fact
,
as
he
was
now
aware
,
filled
all
the
approaches
,
hovered
*NL*
in
the
court
as
he
passed
,
hung
on
the
staircase
as
he
mounted
,
sounded
*NL*
in
the
grave
rumble
of
the
old
bell
,
as
little
electric
as
possible
,
of
*NL*
which
Chad
,
at
the
door
,
had
pulled
the
ancient
but
neatly-kept
tassel
;
*NL*
it
formed
in
short
the
clearest
medium
of
its
particular
kind
that
he
*NL*
had
ever
breathed
.
He
would
have
answered
for
it
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
that
some
of
the
glass
cases
contained
swords
and
*NL*
epaulettes
of
ancient
colonels
and
generals
;
medals
and
orders
once
*NL*
pinned
over
hearts
that
had
long
since
ceased
to
beat
;
snuff-boxes
*NL*
bestowed
on
ministers
and
envoys
;
copies
of
works
presented
,
with
*NL*
inscriptions
,
by
authors
now
classic
.
At
bottom
of
it
all
for
him
was
*NL*
the
sense
of
her
rare
unlikeness
to
the
women
he
had
known
.
This
sense
*NL*
had
grown
,
since
the
day
before
,
the
more
he
recalled
her
,
and
had
been
*NL*
above
all
singularly
fed
by
his
talk
with
Chad
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
Everything
in
fine
made
her
immeasurably
new
,
and
nothing
so
new
as
the
*NL*
old
house
and
the
old
objects
.
There
were
books
,
two
or
three
,
on
a
*NL*
small
table
near
his
chair
,
but
they
had
n't
the
lemon-coloured
covers
*NL*
with
which
his
eye
had
begun
to
dally
from
the
hour
of
his
arrival
and
*NL*
to
the
opportunity
of
a
further
acquaintance
with
which
he
had
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
now
altogether
succumbed
.
On
another
table
,
across
the
room
,
*NL*
he
made
out
the
great
_
Revue
_
;
but
even
that
familiar
face
,
conspicuous
*NL*
in
Mrs.
Newsome
's
parlours
,
scarce
counted
here
as
a
modern
note
.
He
*NL*
was
sure
on
the
spot
--
and
he
afterwards
knew
he
was
right
--
that
this
*NL*
was
a
touch
of
Chad
's
own
hand
.
What
would
Mrs.
Newsome
say
to
the
*NL*
circumstance
that
Chad
's
interested
``
influence
''
kept
her
paper-knife
in
*NL*
the
_
Revue
_
?
The
interested
influence
at
any
rate
had
,
as
we
say
,
gone
*NL*
straight
to
the
point
--
had
in
fact
soon
left
it
quite
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
seated
,
near
the
fire
,
on
a
small
stuffed
and
fringed
chair
one
*NL*
of
the
few
modern
articles
in
the
room
,
and
she
leaned
back
in
it
with
*NL*
her
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
and
no
movement
,
in
all
her
person
,
but
*NL*
the
fine
prompt
play
of
her
deep
young
face
.
The
fire
,
under
the
low
*NL*
white
marble
,
undraped
and
academic
,
had
burnt
down
to
the
silver
ashes
*NL*
of
light
wood
,
one
of
the
windows
,
at
a
distance
,
stood
open
to
the
*NL*
mildness
and
stillness
,
out
of
which
,
in
the
short
pauses
,
came
the
*NL*
faint
sound
,
pleasant
and
homely
,
almost
rustic
,
of
a
plash
and
a
*NL*
clatter
of
sabots
from
some
coach-house
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
while
Strether
sat
there
,
was
n't
to
shift
her
*NL*
posture
by
an
inch
.
``
I
do
n't
think
you
seriously
believe
in
what
you
're
*NL*
doing
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
all
the
same
,
you
know
,
I
'm
going
to
treat
you
*NL*
quite
as
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
which
you
mean
,
''
Strether
directly
replied
,
``
quite
as
if
you
*NL*
did
n't
!
I
assure
you
it
wo
n't
make
the
least
difference
with
me
how
*NL*
you
treat
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
taking
that
menace
bravely
and
philosophically
*NL*
enough
,
``
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
is
that
you
shall
get
on
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
I
do
n't
!
''
he
immediately
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
her
another
pause
;
which
,
however
,
she
happily
enough
shook
*NL*
off
.
``
Will
you
consent
to
go
on
with
me
a
little
--
provisionally
--
as
if
*NL*
you
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
he
saw
how
she
had
decidedly
come
all
the
way
;
and
*NL*
there
accompanied
it
an
extraordinary
sense
of
her
raising
from
*NL*
somewhere
below
him
her
beautiful
suppliant
eyes
.
He
might
have
been
*NL*
perched
at
his
door-step
or
at
his
window
and
she
standing
in
the
road
.
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
let
her
stand
and
could
n't
moreover
have
spoken
.
It
*NL*
had
been
sad
,
of
a
sudden
,
with
a
sadness
that
was
like
a
cold
breath
*NL*
in
his
face
.
``
What
can
I
do
,
''
he
finally
asked
,
``
but
listen
to
you
as
*NL*
I
promised
Chadwick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
what
I
'm
asking
you
,
''
she
quickly
said
,
``
is
n't
what
Mr.
Newsome
*NL*
had
in
mind
.
''
She
spoke
at
present
,
he
saw
,
as
if
to
take
courageously
*NL*
ALL
her
risk
.
``
This
is
my
own
idea
and
a
different
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
poor
Strether
in
truth
--
uneasy
as
it
made
him
too
--
something
of
*NL*
the
thrill
of
a
bold
perception
justified
.
``
Well
,
''
he
answered
kindly
*NL*
enough
,
``
I
was
sure
a
moment
since
that
some
idea
of
your
own
had
come
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
still
to
look
up
at
him
,
but
now
more
serenely
.
``
I
made
out
*NL*
you
were
sure
--
and
that
helped
it
to
come
.
So
you
see
,
''
she
continued
,
*NL*
``
we
do
get
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
it
appears
to
me
I
do
n't
at
all
meet
your
request
.
How
can
I
*NL*
when
I
do
n't
understand
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
at
all
necessary
you
should
understand
;
it
will
do
quite
well
*NL*
enough
if
you
simply
remember
it
.
Only
feel
I
trust
you
--
and
for
*NL*
nothing
so
tremendous
after
all
.
Just
,
''
she
said
with
a
wonderful
*NL*
smile
,
``
for
common
civility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
a
long
pause
while
they
sat
again
face
to
face
,
as
they
*NL*
had
sat
,
scarce
less
conscious
,
before
the
poor
lady
had
crossed
the
*NL*
stream
.
She
was
the
poor
lady
for
Strether
now
because
clearly
she
had
*NL*
some
trouble
,
and
her
appeal
to
him
could
only
mean
that
her
trouble
*NL*
was
deep
.
He
could
n't
help
it
;
it
was
n't
his
fault
;
he
had
done
*NL*
nothing
;
but
by
a
turn
of
the
hand
she
had
somehow
made
their
encounter
*NL*
a
relation
.
And
the
relation
profited
by
a
mass
of
things
that
were
*NL*
not
strictly
in
it
or
of
it
;
by
the
very
air
in
which
they
sat
,
by
the
*NL*
high
cold
delicate
room
,
by
the
world
outside
and
the
little
plash
in
*NL*
the
court
,
by
the
First
Empire
and
the
relics
in
the
stiff
cabinets
,
by
*NL*
matters
as
far
off
as
those
and
by
others
as
near
as
the
unbroken
clasp
*NL*
of
her
hands
in
her
lap
and
the
look
her
expression
had
of
being
most
*NL*
natural
when
her
eyes
were
most
fixed
.
``
You
count
upon
me
of
course
*NL*
for
something
really
much
greater
than
it
sounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
it
sounds
great
enough
too
!
''
she
laughed
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
himself
in
time
on
the
point
of
telling
her
that
she
was
,
as
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
called
it
,
wonderful
;
but
,
catching
himself
up
,
he
said
*NL*
something
else
instead
.
``
What
was
it
Chad
's
idea
then
that
you
should
*NL*
say
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
his
idea
was
simply
what
a
man
's
idea
always
is
--
to
put
every
*NL*
effort
off
on
the
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
`
woman
'
--
?
''
Strether
slowly
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
woman
he
likes
--
and
just
in
proportion
as
he
likes
her
.
In
*NL*
proportion
too
--
for
shifting
the
trouble
--
as
she
likes
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
followed
it
;
then
with
an
abruptness
of
his
own
:
``
How
much
do
*NL*
you
like
Chad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
much
as
THAT
--
to
take
all
,
with
you
,
on
myself
.
''
But
she
got
*NL*
at
once
again
away
from
this
.
``
I
've
been
trembling
as
if
we
were
to
*NL*
stand
or
fall
by
what
you
may
think
of
me
;
and
I
'm
even
now
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
wonderfully
,
``
drawing
a
long
breath
--
and
,
yes
,
truly
taking
a
great
*NL*
courage
--
from
the
hope
that
I
do
n't
in
fact
strike
you
as
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
at
all
events
,
clearly
,
''
he
observed
after
an
instant
,
``
the
way
*NL*
I
do
n't
strike
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
so
far
assented
,
``
as
you
have
n't
yet
said
you
WO
N'T
have
*NL*
the
little
patience
with
me
I
ask
for
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
draw
splendid
conclusions
?
Perfectly
.
But
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
them
,
''
Strether
pursued
.
``
You
seem
to
me
to
ask
for
much
more
than
you
*NL*
need
.
What
,
at
the
worst
for
you
,
what
at
the
best
for
myself
,
can
I
*NL*
after
all
do
?
I
can
use
no
pressure
that
I
have
n't
used
.
You
come
*NL*
really
late
with
your
request
.
I
've
already
done
all
that
for
myself
*NL*
the
case
admits
of
.
I
've
said
my
say
,
and
here
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
you
are
,
fortunately
!
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
laughed
.
``
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
,
''
she
added
in
another
tone
,
``
did
n't
think
you
can
do
so
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
an
hesitation
,
but
he
brought
the
words
out
.
``
Well
,
she
thinks
*NL*
so
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
by
that
--
?
''
But
she
also
hung
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
mean
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
rather
faltered
.
``
Pardon
me
if
I
touch
on
it
,
but
if
I
'm
*NL*
saying
extraordinary
things
,
why
,
perhaps
,
may
n't
I
?
Besides
,
does
n't
*NL*
it
properly
concern
us
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
know
what
?
''
he
insisted
as
after
thus
beating
about
the
bush
she
*NL*
had
again
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
the
effort
.
``
Has
she
given
you
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
amazed
afterwards
to
think
how
simply
and
quietly
he
had
met
it
.
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
''
It
was
almost
as
if
he
were
a
trifle
disappointed
--
had
*NL*
expected
still
more
of
her
freedom
.
But
he
went
straight
on
.
``
Is
that
*NL*
what
Chad
has
told
you
will
happen
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
evidently
charmed
with
the
way
he
took
it
.
``
If
you
mean
if
*NL*
we
've
talked
of
it
--
most
certainly
.
And
the
question
's
not
what
has
*NL*
had
least
to
do
with
my
wishing
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
judge
if
I
'm
the
sort
of
man
a
woman
CAN
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
''
she
exclaimed
--
``
you
wonderful
gentleman
!
I
do
judge
--
I
*NL*
HAVE
judged
.
A
woman
ca
n't
.
You
're
safe
--
with
every
right
to
be
.
*NL*
You
'd
be
much
happier
if
you
'd
only
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
was
silent
a
little
;
then
he
found
himself
speaking
with
a
*NL*
cynicism
of
confidence
of
which
even
at
the
moment
the
sources
were
*NL*
strange
to
him
.
``
I
try
to
believe
it
.
But
it
's
a
marvel
,
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
how
YOU
already
get
at
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
she
was
able
to
say
.
``
Remember
how
much
I
was
on
the
way
to
it
*NL*
through
Mr.
Newsome
--
before
I
saw
you
.
He
thinks
everything
of
your
*NL*
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
bear
almost
anything
!
''
our
friend
briskly
interrupted
.
*NL*
Deep
and
beautiful
on
this
her
smile
came
back
,
and
with
the
effect
of
*NL*
making
him
hear
what
he
had
said
just
as
she
had
heard
it
.
He
easily
*NL*
enough
felt
that
it
gave
him
away
,
but
what
in
truth
had
everything
*NL*
done
but
that
?
It
had
been
all
very
well
to
think
at
moments
that
he
*NL*
was
holding
her
nose
down
and
that
he
had
coerced
her
:
what
had
he
by
*NL*
this
time
done
but
let
her
practically
see
that
he
accepted
their
*NL*
relation
?
What
was
their
relation
moreover
--
though
light
and
brief
*NL*
enough
in
form
as
yet
--
but
whatever
she
might
choose
to
make
it
?
*NL*
Nothing
could
prevent
her
--
certainly
he
could
n't
--
from
making
it
*NL*
pleasant
.
At
the
back
of
his
head
,
behind
everything
,
was
the
sense
*NL*
that
she
was
--
there
,
before
him
,
close
to
him
,
in
vivid
imperative
*NL*
form
--
one
of
the
rare
women
he
had
so
often
heard
of
,
read
of
,
thought
*NL*
of
,
but
never
met
,
whose
very
presence
,
look
,
voice
,
the
mere
*NL*
contemporaneous
FACT
of
whom
,
from
the
moment
it
was
at
all
presented
,
*NL*
made
a
relation
of
mere
recognition
.
That
was
not
the
kind
of
woman
he
*NL*
had
ever
found
Mrs.
Newsome
,
a
contemporaneous
fact
who
had
been
*NL*
distinctly
slow
to
establish
herself
;
and
at
present
,
confronted
with
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
he
felt
the
simplicity
of
his
original
impression
of
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
.
She
certainly
had
been
a
fact
of
rapid
growth
;
but
the
*NL*
world
was
wide
,
each
day
was
more
and
more
a
new
lesson
.
There
were
at
*NL*
any
rate
even
among
the
stranger
ones
relations
and
relations
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
I
suit
Chad
's
grand
way
,
''
he
quickly
added
.
``
He
has
n't
had
much
*NL*
difficulty
in
working
me
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
deny
a
little
,
on
the
young
man
's
behalf
,
by
the
rise
of
*NL*
her
eyebrows
,
an
intention
of
any
process
at
all
inconsiderate
.
``
You
*NL*
must
know
how
grieved
he
'd
be
if
you
were
to
lose
anything
.
He
*NL*
believes
you
can
keep
his
mother
patient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
with
his
eyes
on
her
.
``
I
see
.
THAT
'S
then
what
you
*NL*
really
want
of
me
.
And
how
am
I
to
do
it
?
Perhaps
you
'll
tell
me
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
tell
her
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
call
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
any
truth
--
about
us
all
--
that
you
see
yourself
.
I
leave
it
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
.
I
like
,
''
Strether
laughed
with
a
slight
*NL*
harshness
,
``
the
way
you
leave
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
insisted
kindly
,
gently
,
as
if
it
was
n't
so
bad
.
``
Be
perfectly
*NL*
honest
.
Tell
her
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
?
''
he
oddly
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
the
simple
truth
,
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
again
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
simple
truth
?
The
simple
truth
is
exactly
what
I
'm
*NL*
trying
to
discover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
about
a
while
,
but
presently
she
came
back
to
him
.
``
Tell
*NL*
her
,
fully
and
clearly
,
about
US
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
meanwhile
had
been
staring
.
``
You
and
your
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
little
Jeanne
and
me
.
Tell
her
,
''
she
just
slightly
quavered
,
*NL*
``
you
like
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
good
will
that
do
me
?
Or
rather
''
--
he
caught
himself
*NL*
up
--
``
what
good
will
it
do
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
graver
.
``
None
,
you
believe
,
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
debated
.
``
She
did
n't
send
me
out
to
`
like
'
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
charmingly
contended
,
``
she
sent
you
out
to
face
the
facts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
admitted
after
an
instant
that
there
was
something
in
that
.
``
But
*NL*
how
can
I
face
them
till
I
know
what
they
are
?
Do
you
want
him
,
''
he
*NL*
then
braced
himself
to
ask
,
``
to
marry
your
daughter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
headshake
as
noble
as
it
was
prompt
.
``
No
--
not
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
really
does
n't
want
to
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
the
movement
,
but
now
with
a
strange
light
in
her
face
.
*NL*
``
He
likes
her
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
``
To
be
willing
to
consider
,
you
mean
,
the
question
*NL*
of
taking
her
to
America
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
willing
to
do
anything
with
her
but
be
immensely
kind
and
*NL*
nice
--
really
tender
of
her
.
We
watch
over
her
,
and
you
must
help
us
.
*NL*
You
must
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
felt
awkward
.
``
Ah
with
pleasure
--
she
's
so
remarkably
*NL*
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
's
eagerness
with
which
Madame
de
Vionnet
jumped
at
this
was
*NL*
to
come
back
to
him
later
as
beautiful
in
its
grace
.
``
The
dear
thing
*NL*
DID
please
you
?
''
Then
as
he
met
it
with
the
largest
``
Oh
!
''
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
:
``
She
's
perfect
.
She
's
my
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
sure
that
--
if
one
were
near
her
and
saw
more
of
her
--
she
'd
*NL*
be
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
``
tell
Mrs.
Newsome
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
the
more
.
``
What
good
will
that
do
you
?
''
As
she
appeared
*NL*
unable
at
once
to
say
,
however
,
he
brought
out
something
else
.
``
Is
*NL*
your
daughter
in
love
with
our
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
she
rather
startlingly
answered
,
``
I
wish
you
'd
find
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
his
surprise
.
``
I
?
A
stranger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
wo
n't
be
a
stranger
--
presently
.
You
shall
see
her
quite
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
as
if
you
were
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
remained
for
him
none
the
less
an
extraordinary
notion
.
``
It
seems
*NL*
to
me
surely
that
if
her
mother
ca
n't
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
little
girls
and
their
mothers
to-day
!
''
she
rather
inconsequently
*NL*
broke
in
.
But
she
checked
herself
with
something
she
seemed
to
give
*NL*
out
as
after
all
more
to
the
point
.
``
Tell
her
I
've
been
good
for
him
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
think
I
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
its
effect
on
him
--
more
than
at
the
moment
he
quite
measured
.
*NL*
Yet
he
was
consciously
enough
touched
.
``
Oh
if
it
's
all
you
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
may
not
be
`
all
,
'
''
she
interrupted
,
``
but
it
's
to
a
great
*NL*
extent
.
Really
and
truly
,
''
she
added
in
a
tone
that
was
to
take
its
*NL*
place
with
him
among
things
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
very
wonderful
.
''
He
smiled
at
her
from
a
face
that
he
felt
*NL*
as
strained
,
and
her
own
face
for
a
moment
kept
him
so
.
At
last
she
*NL*
also
got
up
.
``
Well
,
do
n't
you
think
that
for
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
save
you
?
''
So
it
was
that
the
way
to
meet
her
--
and
the
*NL*
way
,
as
well
,
in
a
manner
,
to
get
off
--
came
over
him
.
He
heard
himself
*NL*
use
the
exorbitant
word
,
the
very
sound
of
which
helped
to
determine
*NL*
his
flight
.
``
I
'll
save
you
if
I
can
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
Chad
's
lovely
home
,
however
,
one
evening
ten
days
later
,
he
felt
*NL*
himself
present
at
the
collapse
of
the
question
of
Jeanne
de
Vionnet
's
*NL*
shy
secret
.
He
had
been
dining
there
in
the
company
of
that
young
lady
*NL*
and
her
mother
,
as
well
as
of
other
persons
,
and
he
had
gone
into
the
*NL*
petit
salon
,
at
Chad
's
request
,
on
purpose
to
talk
with
her
.
The
young
*NL*
man
had
put
this
to
him
as
a
favour
--
``
I
should
like
so
awfully
to
know
*NL*
what
you
think
of
her
.
It
will
really
be
a
chance
for
you
,
''
he
had
*NL*
said
,
``
to
see
the
jeune
fille
--
I
mean
the
type
--
as
she
actually
is
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
that
,
as
an
observer
of
manners
,
it
's
a
thing
you
ought
*NL*
to
miss
.
It
will
be
an
impression
that
--
whatever
else
you
take
--
you
*NL*
can
carry
home
with
you
,
where
you
'll
find
again
so
much
to
compare
it
*NL*
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
knew
well
enough
with
what
Chad
wished
him
to
compare
it
,
and
*NL*
though
he
entirely
assented
he
had
n't
yet
somehow
been
so
deeply
*NL*
reminded
that
he
was
being
,
as
he
constantly
though
mutely
expressed
*NL*
it
,
used
.
He
was
as
far
as
ever
from
making
out
exactly
to
what
end
;
*NL*
but
he
was
none
the
less
constantly
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
the
*NL*
service
he
rendered
.
He
conceived
only
that
this
service
was
highly
*NL*
agreeable
to
those
who
profited
by
it
;
and
he
was
indeed
still
waiting
*NL*
for
the
moment
at
which
he
should
catch
it
in
the
act
of
proving
*NL*
disagreeable
,
proving
in
some
degree
intolerable
,
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
failed
quite
to
see
how
his
situation
could
clear
up
at
all
logically
*NL*
except
by
some
turn
of
events
that
would
give
him
the
pretext
of
*NL*
disgust
.
He
was
building
from
day
to
day
on
the
possibility
of
*NL*
disgust
,
but
each
day
brought
forth
meanwhile
a
new
and
more
engaging
*NL*
bend
of
the
road
.
That
possibility
was
now
ever
so
much
further
from
*NL*
sight
than
on
the
eve
of
his
arrival
,
and
he
perfectly
felt
that
,
*NL*
should
it
come
at
all
,
it
would
have
to
be
at
best
inconsequent
and
*NL*
violent
.
He
struck
himself
as
a
little
nearer
to
it
only
when
he
asked
*NL*
himself
what
service
,
in
such
a
life
of
utility
,
he
was
after
all
*NL*
rendering
Mrs.
Newsome
.
When
he
wished
to
help
himself
to
believe
that
*NL*
he
was
still
all
right
he
reflected
--
and
in
fact
with
wonder
--
on
the
*NL*
unimpaired
frequency
of
their
correspondence
;
in
relation
to
which
what
*NL*
was
after
all
more
natural
than
that
it
should
become
more
frequent
*NL*
just
in
proportion
as
their
problem
became
more
complicated
?
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
it
is
at
any
rate
that
he
now
often
brought
himself
balm
by
the
*NL*
question
,
with
the
rich
consciousness
of
yesterday
's
letter
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
what
can
I
do
more
than
that
--
what
can
I
do
more
than
tell
her
*NL*
everything
?
''
To
persuade
himself
that
he
did
tell
her
,
had
told
her
,
*NL*
everything
,
he
used
to
try
to
think
of
particular
things
he
had
n't
told
*NL*
her
.
When
at
rare
moments
and
in
the
watches
of
the
night
he
pounced
*NL*
on
one
it
generally
showed
itself
to
be
--
to
a
deeper
scrutiny
--
not
*NL*
quite
truly
of
the
essence
.
When
anything
new
struck
him
as
coming
up
,
*NL*
or
anything
already
noted
as
reappearing
,
he
always
immediately
wrote
,
*NL*
as
if
for
fear
that
if
he
did
n't
he
would
miss
something
;
and
also
that
*NL*
he
might
be
able
to
say
to
himself
from
time
to
time
``
She
knows
it
*NL*
NOW
--
even
while
I
worry
.
''
It
was
a
great
comfort
to
him
in
general
not
*NL*
to
have
left
past
things
to
be
dragged
to
light
and
explained
;
not
to
*NL*
have
to
produce
at
so
late
a
stage
anything
not
produced
,
or
anything
*NL*
even
veiled
and
attenuated
,
at
the
moment
.
She
knew
it
now
:
that
was
*NL*
what
he
said
to
himself
to-night
in
relation
to
the
fresh
fact
of
*NL*
Chad
's
acquaintance
with
the
two
ladies
--
not
to
speak
of
the
fresher
*NL*
one
of
his
own
.
Mrs.
Newsome
knew
in
other
words
that
very
night
at
*NL*
Woollett
that
he
himself
knew
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
that
he
had
*NL*
conscientiously
been
to
see
her
;
also
that
he
had
found
her
remarkably
*NL*
attractive
and
that
there
would
probably
be
a
good
deal
more
to
tell
.
*NL*
But
she
further
knew
,
or
would
know
very
soon
,
that
,
again
*NL*
conscientiously
,
he
had
n't
repeated
his
visit
;
and
that
when
Chad
had
*NL*
asked
him
on
the
Countess
's
behalf
--
Strether
made
her
out
vividly
,
with
*NL*
a
thought
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
a
Countess
--
if
he
would
n't
name
a
*NL*
day
for
dining
with
her
,
he
had
replied
lucidly
:
``
Thank
you
very
*NL*
much
--
impossible
.
''
He
had
begged
the
young
man
would
present
his
*NL*
excuses
and
had
trusted
him
to
understand
that
it
could
n't
really
*NL*
strike
one
as
quite
the
straight
thing
.
He
had
n't
reported
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
that
he
had
promised
to
``
save
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
;
but
,
so
far
*NL*
as
he
was
concerned
with
that
reminiscence
,
he
had
n't
at
any
rate
*NL*
promised
to
haunt
her
house
.
What
Chad
had
understood
could
only
,
in
*NL*
truth
,
be
inferred
from
Chad
's
behaviour
,
which
had
been
in
this
*NL*
connexion
as
easy
as
in
every
other
.
He
was
easy
,
always
,
when
he
*NL*
understood
;
he
was
easier
still
,
if
possible
,
when
he
did
n't
;
he
had
*NL*
replied
that
he
would
make
it
all
right
;
and
he
had
proceeded
to
do
*NL*
this
by
substituting
the
present
occasion
--
as
he
was
ready
to
*NL*
substitute
others
--
for
any
,
for
every
occasion
as
to
which
his
old
*NL*
friend
should
have
a
funny
scruple
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
'm
not
a
little
foreign
girl
;
I
'm
just
as
English
as
I
can
*NL*
be
,
''
Jeanne
de
Vionnet
had
said
to
him
as
soon
as
,
in
the
petit
salon
,
*NL*
he
sank
,
shyly
enough
on
his
own
side
,
into
the
place
near
her
vacated
*NL*
by
Madame
Gloriani
at
his
approach
.
Madame
Gloriani
,
who
was
in
black
*NL*
velvet
,
with
white
lace
and
powdered
hair
,
and
whose
somewhat
massive
*NL*
majesty
melted
,
at
any
contact
,
into
the
graciousness
of
some
*NL*
incomprehensible
tongue
,
moved
away
to
make
room
for
the
vague
*NL*
gentleman
,
after
benevolent
greetings
to
him
which
embodied
,
as
he
*NL*
believed
,
in
baffling
accents
,
some
recognition
of
his
face
from
a
*NL*
couple
of
Sundays
before
.
Then
he
had
remarked
--
making
the
most
of
the
*NL*
advantage
of
his
years
--
that
it
frightened
him
quite
enough
to
find
*NL*
himself
dedicated
to
the
entertainment
of
a
little
foreign
girl
.
There
*NL*
were
girls
he
was
n't
afraid
of
--
he
was
quite
bold
with
little
*NL*
Americans
.
Thus
it
was
that
she
had
defended
herself
to
the
end
--
``
Oh
*NL*
but
I
'm
almost
American
too
.
That
's
what
mamma
has
wanted
me
to
be
--
I
*NL*
mean
LIKE
that
;
for
she
has
wanted
me
to
have
lots
of
freedom
.
She
has
*NL*
known
such
good
results
from
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fairly
beautiful
to
him
--
a
faint
pastel
in
an
oval
frame
:
he
*NL*
thought
of
her
already
as
of
some
lurking
image
in
a
long
gallery
,
the
*NL*
portrait
of
a
small
old-time
princess
of
whom
nothing
was
known
but
*NL*
that
she
had
died
young
.
Little
Jeanne
was
n't
,
doubtless
,
to
die
*NL*
young
,
but
one
could
n't
,
all
the
same
,
bear
on
her
lightly
enough
.
It
*NL*
was
bearing
hard
,
it
was
bearing
as
HE
,
in
any
case
,
would
n't
bear
,
to
*NL*
concern
himself
,
in
relation
to
her
,
with
the
question
of
a
young
man
.
*NL*
Odious
really
the
question
of
a
young
man
;
one
did
n't
treat
such
a
*NL*
person
as
a
maid-servant
suspected
of
a
``
follower
.
''
And
then
young
*NL*
men
,
young
men
--
well
,
the
thing
was
their
business
simply
,
or
was
at
*NL*
all
events
hers
.
She
was
fluttered
,
fairly
fevered
--
to
the
point
of
a
*NL*
little
glitter
that
came
and
went
in
her
eyes
and
a
pair
of
pink
spots
*NL*
that
stayed
in
her
cheeks
--
with
the
great
adventure
of
dining
out
and
*NL*
with
the
greater
one
still
,
possibly
,
of
finding
a
gentleman
whom
she
*NL*
must
think
of
as
very
,
very
old
,
a
gentleman
with
eye-glasses
,
*NL*
wrinkles
,
a
long
grizzled
moustache
.
She
spoke
the
prettiest
English
,
*NL*
our
friend
thought
,
that
he
had
ever
heard
spoken
,
just
as
he
had
*NL*
believed
her
a
few
minutes
before
to
be
speaking
the
prettiest
French
.
*NL*
He
wondered
almost
wistfully
if
such
a
sweep
of
the
lyre
did
n't
react
*NL*
on
the
spirit
itself
;
and
his
fancy
had
in
fact
,
before
he
knew
it
,
*NL*
begun
so
to
stray
and
embroider
that
he
finally
found
himself
,
absent
*NL*
and
extravagant
,
sitting
with
the
child
in
a
friendly
silence
.
Only
by
*NL*
this
time
he
felt
her
flutter
to
have
fortunately
dropped
and
that
she
*NL*
was
more
at
her
ease
.
She
trusted
him
,
liked
him
,
and
it
was
to
come
*NL*
back
to
him
afterwards
that
she
had
told
him
things
.
She
had
dipped
*NL*
into
the
waiting
medium
at
last
and
found
neither
surge
nor
*NL*
chill
--
nothing
but
the
small
splash
she
could
herself
make
in
the
*NL*
pleasant
warmth
,
nothing
but
the
safety
of
dipping
and
dipping
again
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
ten
minutes
he
was
to
spend
with
her
his
*NL*
impression
--
with
all
it
had
thrown
off
and
all
it
had
taken
in
--
was
*NL*
complete
.
She
had
been
free
,
as
she
knew
freedom
,
partly
to
show
him
*NL*
that
,
unlike
other
little
persons
she
knew
,
she
had
imbibed
that
ideal
.
*NL*
She
was
delightfully
quaint
about
herself
,
but
the
vision
of
what
she
*NL*
had
imbibed
was
what
most
held
him
.
It
really
consisted
,
he
was
soon
*NL*
enough
to
feel
,
in
just
one
great
little
matter
,
the
fact
that
,
*NL*
whatever
her
nature
,
she
was
thoroughly
--
he
had
to
cast
about
for
the
*NL*
word
,
but
it
came
--
bred
.
He
could
n't
of
course
on
so
short
an
*NL*
acquaintance
speak
for
her
nature
,
but
the
idea
of
breeding
was
what
*NL*
she
had
meanwhile
dropped
into
his
mind
.
He
had
never
yet
known
it
so
*NL*
sharply
presented
.
Her
mother
gave
it
,
no
doubt
;
but
her
mother
,
to
*NL*
make
that
less
sensible
,
gave
so
much
else
besides
,
and
on
neither
of
*NL*
the
two
previous
occasions
,
extraordinary
woman
,
Strether
felt
,
*NL*
anything
like
what
she
was
giving
tonight
.
Little
Jeanne
was
a
case
,
*NL*
an
exquisite
case
of
education
;
whereas
the
Countess
,
whom
it
so
amused
*NL*
him
to
think
of
by
that
denomination
,
was
a
case
,
also
exquisite
,
*NL*
of
--
well
,
he
did
n't
know
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
wonderful
taste
,
notre
jeune
homme
''
:
this
was
what
Gloriani
*NL*
said
to
him
on
turning
away
from
the
inspection
of
a
small
picture
*NL*
suspended
near
the
door
of
the
room
.
The
high
celebrity
in
question
*NL*
had
just
come
in
,
apparently
in
search
of
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet
,
but
*NL*
while
Strether
had
got
up
from
beside
her
their
fellow
guest
,
with
his
*NL*
eye
sharply
caught
,
had
paused
for
a
long
look
.
The
thing
was
a
*NL*
landscape
,
of
no
size
,
but
of
the
French
school
,
as
our
friend
was
glad
*NL*
to
feel
he
knew
,
and
also
of
a
quality
--
which
he
liked
to
think
he
*NL*
should
also
have
guessed
;
its
frame
was
large
out
of
proportion
to
the
*NL*
canvas
,
and
he
had
never
seen
a
person
look
at
anything
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
just
as
Gloriani
,
with
his
nose
very
near
and
quick
movements
of
the
*NL*
head
from
side
to
side
and
bottom
to
top
,
examined
this
feature
of
*NL*
Chad
's
collection
.
The
artist
used
that
word
the
next
moment
smiling
*NL*
courteously
,
wiping
his
nippers
and
looking
round
him
further
--
paying
*NL*
the
place
in
short
by
the
very
manner
of
his
presence
and
by
something
*NL*
Strether
fancied
he
could
make
out
in
this
particular
glance
,
such
a
*NL*
tribute
as
,
to
the
latter
's
sense
,
settled
many
things
once
for
all
.
*NL*
Strether
was
conscious
at
this
instant
,
for
that
matter
,
as
he
had
n't
*NL*
yet
been
,
of
how
,
round
about
him
,
quite
without
him
,
they
WERE
*NL*
consistently
settled
.
Gloriani
's
smile
,
deeply
Italian
,
he
considered
,
*NL*
and
finely
inscrutable
,
had
had
for
him
,
during
dinner
,
at
which
they
*NL*
were
not
neighbours
,
an
indefinite
greeting
;
but
the
quality
in
it
was
*NL*
gone
that
had
appeared
on
the
other
occasion
to
turn
him
inside
out
;
it
*NL*
was
as
if
even
the
momentary
link
supplied
by
the
doubt
between
them
*NL*
had
snapped
.
He
was
conscious
now
of
the
final
reality
,
which
was
that
*NL*
there
was
n't
so
much
a
doubt
as
a
difference
altogether
;
all
the
more
*NL*
that
over
the
difference
the
famous
sculptor
seemed
to
signal
almost
*NL*
condolingly
,
yet
oh
how
vacantly
!
as
across
some
great
flat
sheet
of
*NL*
water
.
He
threw
out
the
bridge
of
a
charming
hollow
civility
on
which
*NL*
Strether
would
n't
have
trusted
his
own
full
weight
a
moment
.
That
*NL*
idea
,
even
though
but
transient
and
perhaps
belated
,
had
performed
the
*NL*
office
of
putting
Strether
more
at
his
ease
,
and
the
blurred
picture
*NL*
had
already
dropped
--
dropped
with
the
sound
of
something
else
said
and
*NL*
with
his
becoming
aware
,
by
another
quick
turn
,
that
Gloriani
was
now
*NL*
on
the
sofa
talking
with
Jeanne
,
while
he
himself
had
in
his
ears
again
*NL*
the
familiar
friendliness
and
the
elusive
meaning
of
the
``
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
''
*NL*
that
had
made
him
,
a
fortnight
before
,
challenge
Miss
Barrace
in
vain
.
*NL*
She
had
always
the
air
,
this
picturesque
and
original
lady
,
who
struck
*NL*
him
,
so
oddly
,
as
both
antique
and
modern
--
she
had
always
the
air
of
*NL*
taking
up
some
joke
that
one
had
already
had
out
with
her
.
The
point
*NL*
itself
,
no
doubt
,
was
what
was
antique
,
and
the
use
she
made
of
it
what
*NL*
was
modern
.
He
felt
just
now
that
her
good-natured
irony
did
bear
on
*NL*
something
,
and
it
troubled
him
a
little
that
she
would
n't
be
more
*NL*
explicit
only
assuring
him
,
with
the
pleasure
of
observation
so
visible
*NL*
in
her
,
that
she
would
n't
tell
him
more
for
the
world
.
He
could
take
*NL*
refuge
but
in
asking
her
what
she
had
done
with
Waymarsh
,
though
it
*NL*
must
be
added
that
he
felt
himself
a
little
on
the
way
to
a
clue
after
*NL*
she
had
answered
that
this
personage
was
,
in
the
other
room
,
engaged
in
*NL*
conversation
with
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
He
stared
a
moment
at
the
image
*NL*
of
such
a
conjunction
;
then
,
for
Miss
Barrace
's
benefit
,
he
wondered
.
*NL*
``
Is
she
too
then
under
the
charm
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
a
bit
''
--
Miss
Barrace
was
prompt
.
``
She
makes
nothing
of
him
.
*NL*
She
's
bored
.
She
wo
n't
help
you
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
Strether
laughed
,
``
she
ca
n't
do
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
--
wonderful
as
she
is
.
Besides
,
he
makes
nothing
of
HER
.
*NL*
She
wo
n't
take
him
from
me
--
though
she
would
n't
,
no
doubt
,
having
other
*NL*
affairs
in
hand
,
even
if
she
could
.
I
've
never
,
''
said
Miss
Barrace
,
*NL*
``
seen
her
fail
with
any
one
before
.
And
to-night
,
when
she
's
so
*NL*
magnificent
,
it
would
seem
to
her
strange
--
if
she
minded
.
So
at
any
*NL*
rate
I
have
him
all
.
Je
suis
tranquille
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
understood
,
so
far
as
that
went
;
but
he
was
feeling
for
his
*NL*
clue
.
``
She
strikes
you
to-night
as
particularly
magnificent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
.
Almost
as
I
've
never
seen
her
.
Does
n't
she
you
?
Why
it
's
FOR
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
persisted
in
his
candour
.
''
`
For
'
me
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
''
cried
Miss
Barrace
,
who
persisted
in
the
opposite
of
that
*NL*
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
acutely
admitted
,
``
she
IS
different
.
She
's
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
gay
!
''
Miss
Barrace
laughed
.
``
And
she
has
beautiful
*NL*
shoulders
--
though
there
's
nothing
different
in
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
one
was
sure
of
her
shoulders
.
It
is
n't
her
*NL*
shoulders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
,
with
renewed
mirth
and
the
finest
sense
,
between
the
*NL*
puffs
of
her
cigarette
,
of
the
drollery
of
things
,
appeared
to
find
*NL*
their
conversation
highly
delightful
.
``
Yes
,
it
is
n't
her
shoulders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
is
it
?
''
Strether
earnestly
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
SHE
--
simply
.
It
's
her
mood
.
It
's
her
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
's
her
charm
,
but
we
're
speaking
of
the
difference
.
''
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Miss
Barrace
explained
,
``
she
's
just
brilliant
,
as
we
used
to
*NL*
say
.
That
's
all
.
She
's
various
.
She
's
fifty
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
only
one
''
--
Strether
kept
it
clear
--
``
at
a
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
But
in
fifty
times
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
we
sha
n't
come
to
that
,
''
our
friend
declared
;
and
the
next
moment
*NL*
he
had
moved
in
another
direction
.
``
Will
you
answer
me
a
plain
*NL*
question
?
Will
she
ever
divorce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
looked
at
him
through
all
her
tortoise-shell
.
``
Why
should
*NL*
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
n't
what
he
had
asked
for
,
he
signified
;
but
he
met
it
well
*NL*
enough
.
``
To
marry
Chad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
she
marry
Chad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
convinced
she
's
very
fond
of
him
.
She
has
done
wonders
*NL*
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
how
could
she
do
more
?
Marrying
a
man
,
or
woman
either
,
''
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
sagely
went
on
,
``
is
never
the
wonder
for
any
Jack
and
Jill
*NL*
can
bring
THAT
off
.
The
wonder
is
their
doing
such
things
without
*NL*
marrying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
considered
a
moment
this
proposition
.
``
You
mean
it
's
so
*NL*
beautiful
for
our
friends
simply
to
go
on
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
he
said
made
her
laugh
.
``
Beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nevertheless
insisted
.
``
And
THAT
because
it
's
disinterested
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
,
however
,
suddenly
tired
of
the
question
.
``
Yes
then
--
call
*NL*
it
that
.
Besides
,
she
'll
never
divorce
.
Do
n't
,
moreover
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
``
believe
everything
you
hear
about
her
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
then
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
a
wretch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
But
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
met
him
.
He
's
bien
aimable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
every
one
but
his
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
for
all
I
know
,
to
her
too
--
to
any
,
to
every
woman
.
I
hope
you
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
''
she
pursued
with
a
quick
change
,
``
appreciate
the
care
I
take
*NL*
of
Mr.
Waymarsh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
immensely
.
''
But
Strether
was
not
yet
in
line
.
``
At
all
events
,
''
he
*NL*
roundly
brought
out
,
``
the
attachment
's
an
innocent
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
and
his
?
Ah
,
''
she
laughed
,
``
do
n't
rob
it
of
ALL
interest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
our
friend
's
here
--
to
the
lady
we
've
been
speaking
of
.
''
That
*NL*
was
what
he
had
settled
to
as
an
indirect
but
none
the
less
closely
*NL*
involved
consequence
of
his
impression
of
Jeanne
.
That
was
where
he
*NL*
meant
to
stay
.
``
It
's
innocent
,
''
he
repeated
--
``
I
see
the
whole
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mystified
by
his
abrupt
declaration
,
she
had
glanced
over
at
Gloriani
*NL*
as
at
the
unnamed
subject
of
his
allusion
,
but
the
next
moment
she
had
*NL*
understood
;
though
indeed
not
before
Strether
had
noticed
her
momentary
*NL*
mistake
and
wondered
what
might
possibly
be
behind
that
too
.
He
*NL*
already
knew
that
the
sculptor
admired
Madame
de
Vionnet
;
but
did
this
*NL*
admiration
also
represent
an
attachment
of
which
the
innocence
was
*NL*
discussable
?
He
was
moving
verily
in
a
strange
air
and
on
ground
not
*NL*
of
the
firmest
.
He
looked
hard
for
an
instant
at
Miss
Barrace
,
but
she
*NL*
had
already
gone
on
.
``
All
right
with
Mr.
Newsome
?
Why
of
course
she
*NL*
is
!
''
--
and
she
got
gaily
back
to
the
question
of
her
own
good
friend
.
``
I
*NL*
dare
say
you
're
surprised
that
I
'm
not
worn
out
with
all
I
see
--
it
*NL*
being
so
much
!
--
of
Sitting
Bull
.
But
I
'm
not
,
you
know
--
I
do
n't
mind
*NL*
him
;
I
bear
up
,
and
we
get
on
beautifully
.
I
'm
very
strange
;
I
'm
like
*NL*
that
;
and
often
I
ca
n't
explain
.
There
are
people
who
are
supposed
*NL*
interesting
or
remarkable
or
whatever
,
and
who
bore
me
to
death
;
and
*NL*
then
there
are
others
as
to
whom
nobody
can
understand
what
anybody
*NL*
sees
in
them
--
in
whom
I
see
no
end
of
things
.
''
Then
after
she
had
*NL*
smoked
a
moment
,
``
He
's
touching
,
you
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Know
'
?
''
Strether
echoed
--
``
do
n't
I
,
indeed
?
We
must
move
you
almost
*NL*
to
tears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
do
n't
mean
YOU
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
then
,
for
the
worst
sign
of
all
--
as
I
must
have
it
for
*NL*
you
--
is
that
you
ca
n't
help
me
.
That
's
when
a
woman
pities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
I
do
help
you
!
''
she
cheerfully
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
looked
at
her
hard
,
and
then
after
a
pause
:
``
No
you
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tortoise-shell
,
on
its
long
chain
,
rattled
down
.
``
I
help
you
with
*NL*
Sitting
Bull
.
That
's
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
,
yes
.
''
But
Strether
hesitated
.
``
Do
you
mean
he
talks
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
I
have
to
defend
you
?
No
,
never
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
Strether
mused
.
``
It
's
too
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
his
only
fault
,
''
she
returned
--
``
that
everything
,
with
him
,
is
*NL*
too
deep
.
He
has
depths
of
silence
--
which
he
breaks
only
at
the
*NL*
longest
intervals
by
a
remark
.
And
when
the
remark
comes
it
's
always
*NL*
something
he
has
seen
or
felt
for
himself
--
never
a
bit
banal
THAT
would
*NL*
be
what
one
might
have
feared
and
what
would
kill
me
But
never
.
''
She
*NL*
smoked
again
as
she
thus
,
with
amused
complacency
,
appreciated
her
*NL*
acquisition
.
``
And
never
about
you
.
We
keep
clear
of
you
.
We
're
*NL*
wonderful
.
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
he
does
do
,
''
she
continued
:
``
he
*NL*
tries
to
make
me
presents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presents
?
''
poor
Strether
echoed
,
conscious
with
a
pang
that
HE
had
n't
*NL*
yet
tried
that
in
any
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
you
see
,
''
she
explained
,
``
he
's
as
fine
as
ever
in
the
victoria
;
so
*NL*
that
when
I
leave
him
,
as
I
often
do
almost
for
hours
--
he
likes
it
*NL*
so
--
at
the
doors
of
shops
,
the
sight
of
him
there
helps
me
,
when
I
come
*NL*
out
,
to
know
my
carriage
away
off
in
the
rank
.
But
sometimes
,
for
a
*NL*
change
,
he
goes
with
me
into
the
shops
,
and
then
I
've
all
I
can
do
to
*NL*
prevent
his
buying
me
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
`
treat
'
you
?
''
Strether
almost
gasped
at
all
he
himself
*NL*
had
n't
thought
of
.
He
had
a
sense
of
admiration
.
``
Oh
he
's
much
more
*NL*
in
the
real
tradition
than
I.
Yes
,
''
he
mused
,
``
it
's
the
sacred
rage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sacred
rage
,
exactly
!
''
--
and
Miss
Barrace
,
who
had
n't
before
heard
*NL*
this
term
applied
,
recognised
its
bearing
with
a
clap
of
her
gemmed
*NL*
hands
.
``
Now
I
do
know
why
he
's
not
banal
.
But
I
do
prevent
him
all
*NL*
the
same
--
and
if
you
saw
what
he
sometimes
selects
--
from
buying
.
I
*NL*
save
him
hundreds
and
hundreds
.
I
only
take
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flowers
?
''
Strether
echoed
again
with
a
rueful
reflexion
.
How
many
*NL*
nosegays
had
her
present
converser
sent
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Innocent
flowers
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
as
much
as
he
likes
.
And
he
sends
me
*NL*
splendours
;
he
knows
all
the
best
places
--
he
has
found
them
for
*NL*
himself
;
he
's
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
n't
told
them
to
me
,
''
her
friend
smiled
,
``
he
has
a
life
of
his
*NL*
own
.
''
But
Strether
had
swung
back
to
the
consciousness
that
for
*NL*
himself
after
all
it
never
would
have
done
.
Waymarsh
had
n't
Mrs.
*NL*
Waymarsh
in
the
least
to
consider
,
whereas
Lambert
Strether
had
*NL*
constantly
,
in
the
inmost
honour
of
his
thoughts
,
to
consider
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
.
He
liked
moreover
to
feel
how
much
his
friend
was
in
the
real
*NL*
tradition
.
Yet
he
had
his
conclusion
.
``
WHAT
a
rage
it
is
!
''
He
had
*NL*
worked
it
out
.
``
It
's
an
opposition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
,
but
at
a
distance
.
``
That
's
what
I
feel
.
Yet
to
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
thinks
,
you
know
,
that
I
'VE
a
life
of
my
own
.
And
I
have
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
?
''
She
showed
doubt
,
and
her
laugh
confirmed
it
.
``
Oh
,
oh
,
*NL*
oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
for
myself
.
I
seem
to
have
a
life
only
for
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
for
them
and
WITH
them
!
Just
now
for
instance
with
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
with
whom
?
''
he
asked
before
she
had
had
time
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tone
had
the
effect
of
making
her
hesitate
and
even
,
as
he
guessed
,
*NL*
speak
with
a
difference
.
``
Say
with
Miss
Gostrey
.
What
do
you
do
for
*NL*
HER
?
''
It
really
made
him
wonder
.
``
Nothing
at
all
!

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
having
meanwhile
come
in
,
was
at
present
close
to
*NL*
them
,
and
Miss
Barrace
hereupon
,
instead
of
risking
a
rejoinder
,
became
*NL*
again
with
a
look
that
measured
her
from
top
to
toe
all
mere
*NL*
long-handled
appreciative
tortoise-shell
.
She
had
struck
our
friend
,
*NL*
from
the
first
of
her
appearing
,
as
dressed
for
a
great
occasion
,
and
*NL*
she
met
still
more
than
on
either
of
the
others
the
conception
*NL*
reawakened
in
him
at
their
garden-party
,
the
idea
of
the
femme
du
monde
*NL*
in
her
habit
as
she
lived
.
Her
bare
shoulders
and
arms
were
white
and
*NL*
beautiful
;
the
materials
of
her
dress
,
a
mixture
,
as
he
supposed
,
of
*NL*
silk
and
crape
,
were
of
a
silvery
grey
so
artfully
composed
as
to
give
*NL*
an
impression
of
warm
splendour
;
and
round
her
neck
she
wore
a
collar
*NL*
of
large
old
emeralds
,
the
green
note
of
which
was
more
dimly
repeated
,
*NL*
at
other
points
of
her
apparel
,
in
embroidery
,
in
enamel
,
in
satin
,
in
*NL*
substances
and
textures
vaguely
rich
.
Her
head
,
extremely
fair
and
*NL*
exquisitely
festal
,
was
like
a
happy
fancy
,
a
notion
of
the
antique
,
on
*NL*
an
old
precious
medal
,
some
silver
coin
of
the
Renaissance
;
while
her
*NL*
slim
lightness
and
brightness
,
her
gaiety
,
her
expression
,
her
*NL*
decision
,
contributed
to
an
effect
that
might
have
been
felt
by
a
poet
*NL*
as
half
mythological
and
half
conventional
.
He
could
have
compared
her
*NL*
to
a
goddess
still
partly
engaged
in
a
morning
cloud
,
or
to
a
sea-nymph
*NL*
waist-high
in
the
summer
surge
.
Above
all
she
suggested
to
him
the
*NL*
reflexion
that
the
femme
du
monde
--
in
these
finest
developments
of
the
*NL*
type
--
was
,
like
Cleopatra
in
the
play
,
indeed
various
and
multifold
.
*NL*
She
had
aspects
,
characters
,
days
,
nights
--
or
had
them
at
least
,
showed
*NL*
them
by
a
mysterious
law
of
her
own
,
when
in
addition
to
everything
she
*NL*
happened
also
to
be
a
woman
of
genius
.
She
was
an
obscure
person
,
a
*NL*
muffled
person
one
day
,
and
a
showy
person
,
an
uncovered
person
the
*NL*
next
.
He
thought
of
Madame
de
Vionnet
to-night
as
showy
and
uncovered
,
*NL*
though
he
felt
the
formula
rough
,
because
,
thanks
to
one
of
the
*NL*
short-cuts
of
genius
she
had
taken
all
his
categories
by
surprise
.
*NL*
Twice
during
dinner
he
had
met
Chad
's
eyes
in
a
longish
look
;
but
these
*NL*
communications
had
in
truth
only
stirred
up
again
old
ambiguities
--
so
*NL*
little
was
it
clear
from
them
whether
they
were
an
appeal
or
an
*NL*
admonition
.
``
You
see
how
I
'm
fixed
,
''
was
what
they
appeared
to
convey
;
*NL*
yet
how
he
was
fixed
was
exactly
what
Strether
did
n't
see
.
However
,
*NL*
perhaps
he
should
see
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
capable
of
the
very
great
kindness
of
going
to
relieve
*NL*
Newsome
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
of
the
rather
crushing
responsibility
of
*NL*
Madame
Gloriani
,
while
I
say
a
word
,
if
he
'll
allow
me
,
to
Mr.
*NL*
Strether
,
of
whom
I
've
a
question
to
ask
?
Our
host
ought
to
talk
a
bit
*NL*
to
those
other
ladies
,
and
I
'll
come
back
in
a
minute
to
your
rescue
.
''
*NL*
She
made
this
proposal
to
Miss
Barrace
as
if
her
consciousness
of
a
*NL*
special
duty
had
just
flickered-up
,
but
that
lady
's
recognition
of
*NL*
Strether
's
little
start
at
it
--
as
at
a
betrayal
on
the
speaker
's
part
*NL*
of
a
domesticated
state
--
was
as
mute
as
his
own
comment
;
and
after
an
*NL*
instant
,
when
their
fellow
guest
had
good-naturedly
left
them
,
he
had
*NL*
been
given
something
else
to
think
of
.
``
Why
has
Maria
so
suddenly
*NL*
gone
?
Do
you
know
?
''
That
was
the
question
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
*NL*
brought
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
've
no
reason
to
give
you
but
the
simple
reason
I
've
had
*NL*
from
her
in
a
note
--
the
sudden
obligation
to
join
in
the
south
a
sick
*NL*
friend
who
has
got
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
she
has
been
writing
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
since
she
went
--
I
had
only
a
brief
explanatory
word
before
she
*NL*
started
.
I
went
to
see
her
,
''
Strether
explained
--
``
it
was
the
day
after
*NL*
I
called
on
you
--
but
she
was
already
on
her
way
,
and
her
concierge
told
*NL*
me
that
in
case
of
my
coming
I
was
to
be
informed
she
had
written
to
*NL*
me
.
I
found
her
note
when
I
got
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
listened
with
interest
and
with
her
eyes
on
*NL*
Strether
's
face
;
then
her
delicately
decorated
head
had
a
small
*NL*
melancholy
motion
.
``
She
did
n't
write
to
ME
.
I
went
to
see
her
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
almost
immediately
after
I
had
seen
you
,
and
as
I
assured
her
I
*NL*
would
do
when
I
met
her
at
Gloriani
's
.
She
had
n't
then
told
me
she
was
*NL*
to
be
absent
,
and
I
felt
at
her
door
as
if
I
understood
.
She
's
*NL*
absent
--
with
all
respect
to
her
sick
friend
,
though
I
know
indeed
she
*NL*
has
plenty
--
so
that
I
may
not
see
her
.
She
does
n't
want
to
meet
me
*NL*
again
.
Well
,
''
she
continued
with
a
beautiful
conscious
mildness
,
``
I
*NL*
liked
and
admired
her
beyond
every
one
in
the
old
time
,
and
she
knew
*NL*
it
--
perhaps
that
's
precisely
what
has
made
her
go
--
and
I
dare
say
I
*NL*
have
n't
lost
her
for
ever
.
''
Strether
still
said
nothing
;
he
had
a
*NL*
horror
,
as
he
now
thought
of
himself
,
of
being
in
question
between
*NL*
women
--
was
in
fact
already
quite
enough
on
his
way
to
that
,
and
there
*NL*
was
moreover
,
as
it
came
to
him
,
perceptibly
,
something
behind
these
*NL*
allusions
and
professions
that
,
should
he
take
it
in
,
would
square
but
*NL*
ill
with
his
present
resolve
to
simplify
.
It
was
as
if
,
for
him
,
all
*NL*
the
same
,
her
softness
and
sadness
were
sincere
.
He
felt
that
not
less
*NL*
when
she
soon
went
on
:
``
I
'm
extremely
glad
of
her
happiness
.
''
But
it
*NL*
also
left
him
mute
--
sharp
and
fine
though
the
imputation
it
conveyed
.
*NL*
What
it
conveyed
was
that
HE
was
Maria
Gostrey
's
happiness
,
and
for
the
*NL*
least
little
instant
he
had
the
impulse
to
challenge
the
thought
.
He
*NL*
could
have
done
so
however
only
by
saying
``
What
then
do
you
suppose
to
*NL*
be
between
us
?
''
and
he
was
wonderfully
glad
a
moment
later
not
to
have
*NL*
spoken
.
He
would
rather
seem
stupid
any
day
than
fatuous
,
and
he
drew
*NL*
back
as
well
,
with
a
smothered
inward
shudder
,
from
the
consideration
*NL*
of
what
women
--
of
highly-developed
type
in
particular
--
might
think
of
*NL*
each
other
.
Whatever
he
had
come
out
for
he
had
n't
come
to
go
into
*NL*
that
;
so
that
he
absolutely
took
up
nothing
his
interlocutress
had
now
*NL*
let
drop
.
Yet
,
though
he
had
kept
away
from
her
for
days
,
had
laid
*NL*
wholly
on
herself
the
burden
of
their
meeting
again
,
she
had
n't
a
gleam
*NL*
of
irritation
to
show
him
.
``
Well
,
about
Jeanne
now
?
''
she
smiled
--
it
*NL*
had
the
gaiety
with
which
she
had
originally
come
in
.
He
felt
it
on
the
*NL*
instant
to
represent
her
motive
and
real
errand
.
But
he
had
been
*NL*
schooling
her
of
a
truth
to
say
much
in
proportion
to
his
little
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
make
out
that
she
has
a
sentiment
?
I
mean
for
Mr.
Newsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
resentful
,
Strether
could
at
last
be
prompt
.
``
How
can
I
make
*NL*
out
such
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
perfectly
good-natured
.
``
Ah
but
they
're
beautiful
little
*NL*
things
,
and
you
make
out
--
do
n't
pretend
--
everything
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Have
n't
you
,
''
she
asked
,
``
been
talking
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
not
about
Chad
.
At
least
not
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
do
n't
require
`
much
'
!
''
she
reassuringly
declared
.
But
she
*NL*
immediately
changed
her
ground
.
``
I
hope
you
remember
your
promise
of
*NL*
the
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
`
save
'
you
,
as
you
called
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
it
so
still
.
You
WILL
?
''
she
insisted
.
``
You
have
n't
repented
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
.
``
No
--
but
I
've
been
thinking
what
I
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
it
up
.
``
And
not
,
a
little
,
what
I
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
that
's
not
necessary
.
It
will
be
enough
if
I
know
what
I
meant
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
know
,
''
she
asked
,
``
by
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
had
a
pause
.
``
I
think
you
ought
to
leave
it
to
me
.
But
how
*NL*
long
,
''
he
added
,
``
do
you
give
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
much
more
a
question
of
how
long
you
give
ME
.
Does
n't
*NL*
our
friend
here
himself
,
at
any
rate
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
perpetually
make
*NL*
me
present
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
,
''
Strether
replied
,
``
by
ever
speaking
of
you
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
does
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
considered
,
and
,
if
the
fact
was
disconcerting
to
her
,
effectually
*NL*
concealed
it
.
The
next
minute
indeed
she
had
recovered
.
``
No
,
he
*NL*
would
n't
.
But
do
you
NEED
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
emphasis
was
wonderful
,
and
though
his
eyes
had
been
wandering
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
longer
now
.
``
I
see
what
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
see
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
triumph
was
gentle
,
and
she
really
had
tones
to
make
justice
weep
.
*NL*
``
I
've
before
me
what
he
owes
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admit
then
that
that
's
something
,
''
she
said
,
yet
still
with
the
same
*NL*
discretion
in
her
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
in
this
note
but
went
straight
on
.
``
You
've
made
of
him
what
I
*NL*
see
,
but
what
I
do
n't
see
is
how
in
the
world
you
've
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
another
question
!
''
she
smiled
.
``
The
point
is
of
what
use
is
*NL*
your
declining
to
know
me
when
to
know
Mr.
Newsome
--
as
you
do
me
the
*NL*
honour
to
find
him
--
IS
just
to
know
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
he
mused
,
still
with
his
eyes
on
her
.
``
I
should
n't
have
met
*NL*
you
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
and
dropped
her
linked
hands
.
``
It
does
n't
matter
.
If
I
*NL*
trust
you
why
ca
n't
you
a
little
trust
me
too
?
And
why
ca
n't
you
*NL*
also
,
''
she
asked
in
another
tone
,
``
trust
yourself
?
''
But
she
gave
him
*NL*
no
time
to
reply
.
``
Oh
I
shall
be
so
easy
for
you
!
And
I
'm
glad
at
any
*NL*
rate
you
've
seen
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
too
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
she
does
you
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
good
?
''
--
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
a
clear
stare
.
``
Why
she
's
an
angel
*NL*
of
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
precisely
the
reason
.
Leave
her
alone
.
Do
n't
try
to
find
out
.
*NL*
I
mean
,
''
he
explained
,
``
about
what
you
spoke
to
me
of
--
the
way
she
*NL*
feels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
wondered
.
``
Because
one
really
wo
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
because
I
ask
you
,
as
a
favour
to
myself
,
not
to
.
She
's
the
*NL*
most
charming
creature
I
've
ever
seen
.
Therefore
do
n't
touch
her
.
*NL*
Do
n't
know
--
do
n't
want
to
know
.
And
moreover
--
yes
--
you
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
appeal
,
of
a
sudden
,
and
she
took
it
in
.
``
As
a
favour
to
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
since
you
ask
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
,
everything
you
ask
,
''
she
smiled
.
``
I
sha
n't
know
*NL*
then
--
never
.
Thank
you
,
''
she
added
with
peculiar
gentleness
as
she
*NL*
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
it
lingered
with
him
,
making
him
fairly
feel
as
if
he
had
*NL*
been
tripped
up
and
had
a
fall
.
In
the
very
act
of
arranging
with
her
*NL*
for
his
independence
he
had
,
under
pressure
from
a
particular
*NL*
perception
,
inconsistently
,
quite
stupidly
,
committed
himself
,
and
,
*NL*
with
her
subtlety
sensitive
on
the
spot
to
an
advantage
,
she
had
driven
*NL*
in
by
a
single
word
a
little
golden
nail
,
the
sharp
intention
of
which
*NL*
he
signally
felt
.
He
had
n't
detached
,
he
had
more
closely
connected
*NL*
himself
,
and
his
eyes
,
as
he
considered
with
some
intensity
this
*NL*
circumstance
,
met
another
pair
which
had
just
come
within
their
range
*NL*
and
which
struck
him
as
reflecting
his
sense
of
what
he
had
done
.
He
*NL*
recognised
them
at
the
same
moment
as
those
of
little
Bilham
,
who
had
*NL*
apparently
drawn
near
on
purpose
to
speak
to
him
,
and
little
Bilham
*NL*
was
n't
,
in
the
conditions
,
the
person
to
whom
his
heart
would
be
most
*NL*
closed
.
They
were
seated
together
a
minute
later
at
the
angle
of
the
*NL*
room
obliquely
opposite
the
corner
in
which
Gloriani
was
still
engaged
*NL*
with
Jeanne
de
Vionnet
,
to
whom
at
first
and
in
silence
their
attention
*NL*
had
been
benevolently
given
.
``
I
ca
n't
see
for
my
life
,
''
Strether
had
*NL*
then
observed
,
``
how
a
young
fellow
of
any
spirit
--
such
a
one
as
you
for
*NL*
instance
--
can
be
admitted
to
the
sight
of
that
young
lady
without
being
*NL*
hard
hit
.
Why
do
n't
you
go
in
,
little
Bilham
?
''
He
remembered
the
tone
*NL*
into
which
he
had
been
betrayed
on
the
garden-bench
at
the
sculptor
's
*NL*
reception
,
and
this
might
make
up
for
that
by
being
much
more
the
right
*NL*
sort
of
thing
to
say
to
a
young
man
worthy
of
any
advice
at
all
.
``
There
*NL*
WOULD
be
some
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
reason
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
for
hanging
on
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
offer
my
hand
and
fortune
to
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
to
what
lovelier
apparition
COULD
you
offer
*NL*
them
?
She
's
the
sweetest
little
thing
I
've
ever
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
certainly
immense
.
I
mean
she
's
the
real
thing
.
I
believe
the
*NL*
pale
pink
petals
are
folded
up
there
for
some
wondrous
efflorescence
in
*NL*
time
;
to
open
,
that
is
,
to
some
great
golden
sun
.
I
'M
unfortunately
but
*NL*
a
small
farthing
candle
.
What
chance
in
such
a
field
for
a
poor
little
*NL*
painter-man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
're
good
enough
,
''
Strether
threw
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
'm
good
enough
.
We
're
good
enough
,
I
consider
,
nous
*NL*
autres
,
for
anything
.
But
she
's
TOO
good
.
There
's
the
difference
.
*NL*
They
would
n't
look
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
lounging
on
his
divan
and
still
charmed
by
the
young
girl
,
*NL*
whose
eyes
had
consciously
strayed
to
him
,
he
fancied
,
with
a
vague
*NL*
smile
--
Strether
,
enjoying
the
whole
occasion
as
with
dormant
pulses
at
*NL*
last
awake
and
in
spite
of
new
material
thrust
upon
him
,
thought
over
*NL*
his
companion
's
words
.
``
Whom
do
you
mean
by
`
they
'
?
She
and
her
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
and
her
mother
.
And
she
has
a
father
too
,
who
,
whatever
else
he
*NL*
may
be
,
certainly
ca
n't
be
indifferent
to
the
possibilities
she
*NL*
represents
.
Besides
,
there
's
Chad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
was
silent
a
little
.
``
Ah
but
he
does
n't
care
for
her
--
not
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
it
appears
,
after
all
,
in
the
sense
I
'm
speaking
of
.
He
's
NOT
in
*NL*
love
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
but
he
's
her
best
friend
;
after
her
mother
.
He
's
very
fond
of
*NL*
her
.
He
has
his
ideas
about
what
can
be
done
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
very
strange
!
''
Strether
presently
remarked
with
a
sighing
*NL*
sense
of
fulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
strange
indeed
.
That
's
just
the
beauty
of
it
.
Is
n't
it
very
*NL*
much
the
kind
of
beauty
you
had
in
mind
,
''
little
Bilham
went
on
,
``
when
*NL*
you
were
so
wonderful
and
so
inspiring
to
me
the
other
day
?
Did
n't
you
*NL*
adjure
me
,
in
accents
I
shall
never
forget
,
to
see
,
while
I
've
a
*NL*
chance
,
everything
I
can
?

and
REALLY
to
see
,
for
it
must
have
been
*NL*
that
only
you
meant
.
Well
,
you
did
me
no
end
of
good
,
and
I
'm
doing
my
*NL*
best
.
I
DO
make
it
out
a
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
!
''
Strether
went
on
after
a
moment
.
But
he
had
the
next
minute
*NL*
an
inconsequent
question
.
``
How
comes
Chad
so
mixed
up
,
anyway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
,
ah
!
''
--
and
little
Bilham
fell
back
on
his
cushions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
reminded
our
friend
of
Miss
Barrace
,
and
he
felt
again
the
brush
of
*NL*
his
sense
of
moving
in
a
maze
of
mystic
closed
allusions
.
Yet
he
kept
*NL*
hold
of
his
thread
.
``
Of
course
I
understand
really
;
only
the
general
*NL*
transformation
makes
me
occasionally
gasp
.
Chad
with
such
a
voice
in
*NL*
the
settlement
of
the
future
of
a
little
countess
--
no
,
''
he
declared
,
*NL*
``
it
takes
more
time
!
You
say
moreover
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
that
we
're
*NL*
inevitably
,
people
like
you
and
me
,
out
of
the
running
.
The
curious
*NL*
fact
remains
that
Chad
himself
is
n't
.
The
situation
does
n't
make
for
*NL*
it
,
but
in
a
different
one
he
could
have
her
if
he
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
that
's
only
because
he
's
rich
and
because
there
's
a
*NL*
possibility
of
his
being
richer
.
They
wo
n't
think
of
anything
but
a
*NL*
great
name
or
a
great
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
he
'll
have
no
great
fortune
on
THESE
lines
.
He
*NL*
must
stir
his
stumps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
,
''
little
Bilham
enquired
,
``
what
you
were
saying
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
do
n't
say
much
to
her
.
Of
course
,
however
,
''
Strether
continued
,
*NL*
``
he
can
make
sacrifices
if
he
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
had
a
pause
.
``
Oh
he
's
not
keen
for
sacrifices
;
or
*NL*
thinks
,
that
is
,
possibly
,
that
he
has
made
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
IS
virtuous
,
''
his
companion
observed
with
some
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
,
''
the
young
man
dropped
after
a
moment
,
``
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
kept
Strether
himself
silent
a
little
.
``
I
've
made
it
out
for
*NL*
myself
,
''
he
then
went
on
;
``
I
've
really
,
within
the
last
half-hour
,
got
*NL*
hold
of
it
.
I
understand
it
in
short
at
last
;
which
at
first
--
when
you
*NL*
originally
spoke
to
me
--
I
did
n't
.
Nor
when
Chad
originally
spoke
to
me
*NL*
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
little
Bilham
,
``
I
do
n't
think
that
at
that
time
you
believed
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
did
;
and
I
believed
Chad
too
.
It
would
have
been
odious
and
*NL*
unmannerly

as
well
as
quite
perverse
--
if
I
had
n't
.
What
interest
have
*NL*
you
in
deceiving
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
cast
about
.
``
What
interest
have
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Chad
MIGHT
have
.
But
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
,
ah
!
''
little
Bilham
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
,
on
repetition
,
as
a
mystification
,
have
irritated
our
friend
*NL*
a
little
,
but
he
knew
,
once
more
,
as
we
have
seen
,
where
he
was
,
and
*NL*
his
being
proof
against
everything
was
only
another
attestation
that
he
*NL*
meant
to
stay
there
.
``
I
could
n't
,
without
my
own
impression
,
realise
.
*NL*
She
's
a
tremendously
clever
brilliant
capable
woman
,
and
with
an
*NL*
extraordinary
charm
on
top
of
it
all
--
the
charm
we
surely
all
of
us
*NL*
this
evening
know
what
to
think
of
.
It
is
n't
every
clever
brilliant
*NL*
capable
woman
that
has
it
.
In
fact
it
's
rare
with
any
woman
.
So
there
*NL*
you
are
,
''
Strether
proceeded
as
if
not
for
little
Bilham
's
benefit
*NL*
alone
.
``
I
understand
what
a
relation
with
such
a
woman
--
what
such
a
*NL*
high
fine
friendship
--
may
be
.
It
ca
n't
be
vulgar
or
coarse
,
*NL*
anyway

and
that
's
the
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
's
the
point

said
little
Bilham
.
``
It
ca
n't
be
vulgar

*NL*
coarse

And
,
bless
us
and
save
us

!
It
's
,
upon
my
word
,
the
*NL*
very
finest
thing
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
,
and
the
most
distinguished
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
from
beside
him
and
leaning
back
with
him
as
he
leaned
,
*NL*
dropped
on
him
a
momentary
look
which
filled
a
short
interval
and
of
*NL*
which
he
took
no
notice
.
He
only
gazed
before
him
with
intent
*NL*
participation
.
``
Of
course
what
it
has
done
for
him
,
''
Strether
at
all
*NL*
events
presently
pursued
,
``
of
course
what
it
has
done
for
him

that
is
*NL*
as
to
HOW
it
has
so
wonderfully
worked

is
n't
a
thing
I
pretend
to
*NL*
understand

I
've
to
take
it
as
I
find
it
.
There
he
is
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
!
''
little
Bilham
echoed
.
``
And
it
's
really
and
truly
she
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
either
,
even
with
my
longer
and
closer
opportunity
.
*NL*
But
I
'm
like
you
,
''
he
added
;
``
I
can
admire
and
rejoice
even
when
I
'm
a
*NL*
little
in
the
dark
.
You
see
I
've
watched
it
for
some
three
years
,
and
*NL*
especially
for
this
last
.
He
was
n't
so
bad
before
it
as
I
seem
to
have
*NL*
made
out
that
you
think

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
do
n't
think
anything
now

Strether
impatiently
broke
in
:
``
that
*NL*
is
but
what
I
DO
think

I
mean
that
originally

for
her
to
have
cared

for
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
have
been
stuff
in
him

Oh
yes

there
was
stuff
indeed

much
more
of
it
than
ever
showed

I
dare
say
,
at
home
.
Still
,
you
*NL*
know

the
young
man
in
all
fairness
developed
,
``
there
was
room
for
*NL*
her
,
and
that
's
where
she
came
in
.
She
saw
her
chance
and
took
it
.
*NL*
That
's
what
strikes
me
as
having
been
so
fine
.
But
of
course
,
''
he
*NL*
wound
up
,
``
he
liked
her
first

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,

said
Strether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
they
first
met
somehow

somewhere

I
believe
in
some
*NL*
American
house

and
she
,
without
in
the
least
then
intending
it
,
made
*NL*
her
impression
.
Then
with
time
and
opportunity
he
made
his
;
and
after
*NL*
THAT
she
was
as
bad
as
he
.

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
vaguely
took
it
up
.
``
As
`
bad
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
began
,
that
is
,
to
care

to
care
very
much

Alone
,
and
in
her
*NL*
horrid
position
,
she
found
it
,
when
once
she
had
started
,
an
interest
.
*NL*
It
was
,
it
is
,
an
interest
,
and
it
did
--
it
continues
to
do
--
a
lot
for
*NL*
herself
as
well

So
she
still
cares

She
cares
in
fact

said
little
*NL*
Bilham
thoughtfully
``
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
theory
that
it
was
none
of
his
business
was
somehow
not
*NL*
damaged
by
the
way
he
took
this
.
``
More
,
you
mean
,
than
he
?
''
On
which
*NL*
his
companion
looked
round
at
him
,
and
now
for
an
instant
their
eyes
*NL*
met
.
``
More
than
he
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
,
for
as
long
,
hung
fire
.
``
Will
you
never
tell
any
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
.
``
Whom
should
I
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
supposed
you
reported
regularly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
people
at
home
?
''
--
Strether
took
him
up
.
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
tell
them
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
at
last
looked
away
.
``
Then
she
does
now
care
more
than
*NL*
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Strether
oddly
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
companion
immediately
met
it
.
``
Have
n't
you
after
all
had
your
*NL*
impression
of
it
?
That
's
how
you
've
got
hold
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
I
have
n't
got
hold
of
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
say
!
''
But
it
was
all
little
Bilham
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
at
any
rate
none
of
my
business
.
I
mean
,
''
Strether
explained
,
*NL*
``
nothing
else
than
getting
hold
of
him
is
.
''
It
appeared
,
however
,
to
*NL*
strike
him
as
his
business
to
add
:
``
The
fact
remains
nevertheless
that
*NL*
she
has
saved
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
just
waited
.
``
I
thought
that
was
what
you
were
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Strether
had
his
answer
ready
.
``
I
'm
speaking
--
in
connexion
with
*NL*
her
--
of
his
manners
and
morals
,
his
character
and
life
.
I
'm
speaking
*NL*
of
him
as
a
person
to
deal
with
and
talk
with
and
live
with
--
speaking
*NL*
of
him
as
a
social
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
n't
it
as
a
social
animal
that
you
also
want
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
;
so
that
it
's
as
if
she
had
saved
him
FOR
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
strikes
you
accordingly
then
,
''
the
young
man
threw
out
,
``
as
for
you
*NL*
all
to
save
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
for
us
`
all
'
--
!
''
Strether
could
but
laugh
at
that
.
It
brought
him
*NL*
back
,
however
,
to
the
point
he
had
really
wished
to
make
.
``
They
've
*NL*
accepted
their
situation
--
hard
as
it
is
.
They
're
not
free
--
at
least
*NL*
she
's
not
;
but
they
take
what
's
left
to
them
.
It
's
a
friendship
,
of
a
*NL*
beautiful
sort
;
and
that
's
what
makes
them
so
strong
.
They
're
*NL*
straight
,
they
feel
;
and
they
keep
each
other
up
.
It
's
doubtless
she
,
*NL*
however
,
who
,
as
you
yourself
have
hinted
,
feels
it
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
appeared
to
wonder
what
he
had
hinted
.
``
Feels
most
that
*NL*
they
're
straight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
feels
that
SHE
is
,
and
the
strength
that
comes
from
it
.
She
*NL*
keeps
HIM
up
--
she
keeps
the
whole
thing
up
.
When
people
are
able
to
*NL*
it
's
fine
.
She
's
wonderful
,
wonderful
,
as
Miss
Barrace
says
;
and
he
*NL*
is
,
in
his
way
,
too
;
however
,
as
a
mere
man
,
he
may
sometimes
rebel
and
*NL*
not
feel
that
he
finds
his
account
in
it
.
She
has
simply
given
him
an
*NL*
immense
moral
lift
,
and
what
that
can
explain
is
prodigious
.
That
's
why
*NL*
I
speak
of
it
as
a
situation
.
It
IS
one
,
if
there
ever
was
.
''
And
*NL*
Strether
,
with
his
head
back
and
his
eyes
on
the
ceiling
,
seemed
to
*NL*
lose
himself
in
the
vision
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
attended
deeply
.
``
You
state
it
much
better
than
I
*NL*
could
.
''
``
Oh
you
see
it
does
n't
concern
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
considered
.
``
I
thought
you
said
just
now
that
it
does
n't
*NL*
concern
you
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
does
n't
a
bit
as
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
affair
.
But
as
we
were
*NL*
again
saying
just
now
,
what
did
I
come
out
for
but
to
save
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
to
remove
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
save
him
by
removal
;
to
win
him
over
to
HIMSELF
thinking
it
best
he
*NL*
shall
take
up
business
--
thinking
he
must
immediately
do
therefore
*NL*
what
's
necessary
to
that
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
little
Bilham
after
a
moment
,
``
you
HAVE
won
him
over
.
He
*NL*
does
think
it
best
.
He
has
within
a
day
or
two
again
said
to
me
as
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
is
why
you
consider
that
he
cares
less
*NL*
than
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cares
less
for
her
than
she
for
him
?
Yes
,
that
's
one
of
the
reasons
.
*NL*
But
other
things
too
have
given
me
the
impression
.
A
man
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
think
?
''
little
Bilham
presently
pursued
,
``
CA
N'T
,
in
such
conditions
,
*NL*
care
so
much
as
a
woman
.
It
takes
different
conditions
to
make
him
,
*NL*
and
then
perhaps
he
cares
more
.
Chad
,
''
he
wound
up
,
``
has
his
possible
*NL*
future
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
speaking
of
his
business
future
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
on
the
contrary
;
of
the
other
,
the
future
of
what
you
so
justly
*NL*
call
their
situation
.
M.
de
Vionnet
may
live
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
they
ca
n't
marry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
waited
a
moment
.
``
Not
being
able
to
marry
is
all
they
've
*NL*
with
any
confidence
to
look
forward
to
.
A
woman
--
a
particular
*NL*
woman
--
may
stand
that
strain
.
But
can
a
man
?
''
he
propounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
answer
was
as
prompt
as
if
he
had
already
,
for
himself
,
*NL*
worked
it
out
.
``
Not
without
a
very
high
ideal
of
conduct
.
But
that
's
*NL*
just
what
we
're
attributing
to
Chad
.
And
how
,
for
that
matter
,
''
he
*NL*
mused
,
``
does
his
going
to
America
diminish
the
particular
strain
?
*NL*
Would
n't
it
seem
rather
to
add
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
sight
out
of
mind
!
''
his
companion
laughed
.
Then
more
bravely
:
*NL*
``
Would
n't
distance
lessen
the
torment
?
''
But
before
Strether
could
*NL*
reply
,
``
The
thing
is
,
you
see
,
Chad
ought
to
marry
!
''
he
wound
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
for
a
little
,
appeared
to
think
of
it
.
``
If
you
talk
of
*NL*
torments
you
do
n't
diminish
mine
!
''
he
then
broke
out
.
The
next
moment
*NL*
he
was
on
his
feet
with
a
question
.
``
He
ought
to
marry
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
rose
more
slowly
.
``
Well
,
some
one
he
CAN
--
some
*NL*
thoroughly
nice
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
eyes
,
as
they
stood
together
,
turned
again
to
Jeanne
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
mean
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
made
a
sudden
strange
face
.
``
After
being
in
love
with
her
*NL*
mother
?
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
n't
it
exactly
your
idea
that
he
IS
n't
in
love
with
her
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
once
more
had
a
pause
.
``
Well
,
he
is
n't
at
any
rate
in
love
*NL*
with
Jeanne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
CAN
he
be
with
any
other
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
I
admit
.
But
being
in
love
is
n't
,
you
know
,
here
''
--
little
*NL*
Bilham
spoke
in
friendly
reminder
--
``
thought
necessary
,
in
strictness
,
*NL*
for
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
torment
--
to
call
a
torment
--
can
there
ever
possibly
be
with
a
*NL*
woman
like
that
?
''
As
if
from
the
interest
of
his
own
question
Strether
*NL*
had
gone
on
without
hearing
.
``
Is
it
for
her
to
have
turned
a
man
out
*NL*
so
wonderfully
,
too
,
only
for
somebody
else
?
''
He
appeared
to
make
a
*NL*
point
of
this
,
and
little
Bilham
looked
at
him
now
.
``
When
it
's
for
*NL*
each
other
that
people
give
things
up
they
do
n't
miss
them
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
threw
off
as
with
an
extravagance
of
which
he
was
conscious
:
``
Let
them
*NL*
face
the
future
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
looked
at
him
indeed
.
``
You
mean
that
after
all
he
*NL*
should
n't
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
if
he
gives
her
up
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
.
''
But
Strether
spoke
with
a
*NL*
sound
that
might
have
passed
for
a
laugh
.

Volume

*NL*
*NL*
Book
Seventh
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
n't
the
first
time
Strether
had
sat
alone
in
the
great
dim
*NL*
church
--
still
less
was
it
the
first
of
his
giving
himself
up
,
so
far
as
*NL*
conditions
permitted
,
to
its
beneficent
action
on
his
nerves
.
He
had
*NL*
been
to
Notre
Dame
with
Waymarsh
,
he
had
been
there
with
Miss
Gostrey
,
*NL*
he
had
been
there
with
Chad
Newsome
,
and
had
found
the
place
,
even
in
*NL*
company
,
such
a
refuge
from
the
obsession
of
his
problem
that
,
with
*NL*
renewed
pressure
from
that
source
,
he
had
not
unnaturally
recurred
to
a
*NL*
remedy
meeting
the
case
,
for
the
moment
,
so
indirectly
,
no
doubt
,
but
*NL*
so
relievingly
.
He
was
conscious
enough
that
it
was
only
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
but
good
moments
--
if
he
could
call
them
good
--
still
had
their
*NL*
value
for
a
man
who
by
this
time
struck
himself
as
living
almost
*NL*
disgracefully
from
hand
to
mouth
.
Having
so
well
learnt
the
way
,
he
*NL*
had
lately
made
the
pilgrimage
more
than
once
by
himself
--
had
quite
*NL*
stolen
off
,
taking
an
unnoticed
chance
and
making
no
point
of
speaking
*NL*
of
the
adventure
when
restored
to
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
great
friend
,
for
that
matter
,
was
still
absent
,
as
well
as
*NL*
remarkably
silent
;
even
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
Miss
Gostrey
had
n't
*NL*
come
back
.
She
wrote
to
him
from
Mentone
,
admitting
that
he
must
judge
*NL*
her
grossly
inconsequent
--
perhaps
in
fact
for
the
time
odiously
*NL*
faithless
;
but
asking
for
patience
,
for
a
deferred
sentence
,
throwing
*NL*
herself
in
short
on
his
generosity
.
For
her
too
,
she
could
assure
him
,
*NL*
life
was
complicated
--
more
complicated
than
he
could
have
guessed
;
she
*NL*
had
moreover
made
certain
of
him
--
certain
of
not
wholly
missing
him
on
*NL*
her
return
--
before
her
disappearance
.
If
furthermore
she
did
n't
burden
*NL*
him
with
letters
it
was
frankly
because
of
her
sense
of
the
other
great
*NL*
commerce
he
had
to
carry
on
.
He
himself
,
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
*NL*
had
written
twice
,
to
show
how
his
generosity
could
be
trusted
;
but
he
*NL*
reminded
himself
in
each
case
of
Mrs.
Newsome
's
epistolary
manner
at
*NL*
the
times
when
Mrs.
Newsome
kept
off
delicate
ground
.
He
sank
his
*NL*
problem
,
he
talked
of
Waymarsh
and
Miss
Barrace
,
of
little
Bilham
and
*NL*
the
set
over
the
river
,
with
whom
he
had
again
had
tea
,
and
he
was
*NL*
easy
,
for
convenience
,
about
Chad
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
Jeanne
.
He
*NL*
admitted
that
he
continued
to
see
them
,
he
was
decidedly
so
confirmed
a
*NL*
haunter
of
Chad
's
premises
and
that
young
man
's
practical
intimacy
with
*NL*
them
was
so
undeniably
great
;
but
he
had
his
reason
for
not
attempting
*NL*
to
render
for
Miss
Gostrey
's
benefit
the
impression
of
these
last
days
.
*NL*
That
would
be
to
tell
her
too
much
about
himself
--
it
being
at
present
*NL*
just
from
himself
he
was
trying
to
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
small
struggle
sprang
not
a
little
,
in
its
way
,
from
the
same
*NL*
impulse
that
had
now
carried
him
across
to
Notre
Dame
;
the
impulse
to
*NL*
let
things
be
,
to
give
them
time
to
justify
themselves
or
at
least
to
*NL*
pass
.
He
was
aware
of
having
no
errand
in
such
a
place
but
the
desire
*NL*
not
to
be
,
for
the
hour
,
in
certain
other
places
;
a
sense
of
safety
,
of
*NL*
simplification
,
which
each
time
he
yielded
to
it
he
amused
himself
by
*NL*
thinking
of
as
a
private
concession
to
cowardice
.
The
great
church
had
*NL*
no
altar
for
his
worship
,
no
direct
voice
for
his
soul
;
but
it
was
none
*NL*
the
less
soothing
even
to
sanctity
;
for
he
could
feel
while
there
what
*NL*
he
could
n't
elsewhere
,
that
he
was
a
plain
tired
man
taking
the
holiday
*NL*
he
had
earned
.
He
was
tired
,
but
he
was
n't
plain
--
that
was
the
pity
*NL*
and
the
trouble
of
it
;
he
was
able
,
however
,
to
drop
his
problem
at
the
*NL*
door
very
much
as
if
it
had
been
the
copper
piece
that
he
deposited
,
on
*NL*
the
threshold
,
in
the
receptacle
of
the
inveterate
blind
beggar
.
He
*NL*
trod
the
long
dim
nave
,
sat
in
the
splendid
choir
,
paused
before
the
*NL*
cluttered
chapels
of
the
east
end
,
and
the
mighty
monument
laid
upon
*NL*
him
its
spell
.
He
might
have
been
a
student
under
the
charm
of
a
*NL*
museum
--
which
was
exactly
what
,
in
a
foreign
town
,
in
the
afternoon
of
*NL*
life
,
he
would
have
liked
to
be
free
to
be
.
This
form
of
sacrifice
did
*NL*
at
any
rate
for
the
occasion
as
well
as
another
;
it
made
him
quite
*NL*
sufficiently
understand
how
,
within
the
precinct
,
for
the
real
refugee
,
*NL*
the
things
of
the
world
could
fall
into
abeyance
.
That
was
the
*NL*
cowardice
,
probably
--
to
dodge
them
,
to
beg
the
question
,
not
to
deal
*NL*
with
it
in
the
hard
outer
light
;
but
his
own
oblivions
were
too
brief
,
*NL*
too
vain
,
to
hurt
any
one
but
himself
,
and
he
had
a
vague
and
fanciful
*NL*
kindness
for
certain
persons
whom
he
met
,
figures
of
mystery
and
*NL*
anxiety
,
and
whom
,
with
observation
for
his
pastime
,
he
ranked
as
those
*NL*
who
were
fleeing
from
justice
.
Justice
was
outside
,
in
the
hard
light
,
*NL*
and
injustice
too
;
but
one
was
as
absent
as
the
other
from
the
air
of
*NL*
the
long
aisles
and
the
brightness
of
the
many
altars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
was
at
all
events
that
,
one
morning
some
dozen
days
after
the
*NL*
dinner
in
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
at
which
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
been
*NL*
present
with
her
daughter
,
he
was
called
upon
to
play
his
part
in
an
*NL*
encounter
that
deeply
stirred
his
imagination
.
He
had
the
habit
,
in
*NL*
these
contemplations
,
of
watching
a
fellow
visitant
,
here
and
there
,
*NL*
from
a
respectable
distance
,
remarking
some
note
of
behaviour
,
of
*NL*
penitence
,
of
prostration
,
of
the
absolved
,
relieved
state
;
this
was
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
his
vague
tenderness
took
its
course
,
the
degree
of
*NL*
demonstration
to
which
it
naturally
had
to
confine
itself
.
It
had
n't
*NL*
indeed
so
felt
its
responsibility
as
when
on
this
occasion
he
suddenly
*NL*
measured
the
suggestive
effect
of
a
lady
whose
supreme
stillness
,
in
*NL*
the
shade
of
one
of
the
chapels
,
he
had
two
or
three
times
noticed
as
*NL*
he
made
,
and
made
once
more
,
his
slow
circuit
.
She
was
n't
*NL*
prostrate
--
not
in
any
degree
bowed
,
but
she
was
strangely
fixed
,
and
*NL*
her
prolonged
immobility
showed
her
,
while
he
passed
and
paused
,
as
*NL*
wholly
given
up
to
the
need
,
whatever
it
was
,
that
had
brought
her
*NL*
there
.
She
only
sat
and
gazed
before
her
,
as
he
himself
often
sat
;
but
*NL*
she
had
placed
herself
,
as
he
never
did
,
within
the
focus
of
the
*NL*
shrine
,
and
she
had
lost
herself
,
he
could
easily
see
,
as
he
would
only
*NL*
have
liked
to
do
.
She
was
not
a
wandering
alien
,
keeping
back
more
than
*NL*
she
gave
,
but
one
of
the
familiar
,
the
intimate
,
the
fortunate
,
for
*NL*
whom
these
dealings
had
a
method
and
a
meaning
.
She
reminded
our
*NL*
friend
--
since
it
was
the
way
of
nine
tenths
of
his
current
impressions
*NL*
to
act
as
recalls
of
things
imagined
--
of
some
fine
firm
concentrated
*NL*
heroine
of
an
old
story
,
something
he
had
heard
,
read
,
something
that
,
*NL*
had
he
had
a
hand
for
drama
,
he
might
himself
have
written
,
renewing
*NL*
her
courage
,
renewing
her
clearness
,
in
splendidly-protected
*NL*
meditation
.
Her
back
,
as
she
sat
,
was
turned
to
him
,
but
his
*NL*
impression
absolutely
required
that
she
should
be
young
and
*NL*
interesting
,
and
she
carried
her
head
moreover
,
even
in
the
sacred
*NL*
shade
,
with
a
discernible
faith
in
herself
,
a
kind
of
implied
*NL*
conviction
of
consistency
,
security
,
impunity
.
But
what
had
such
a
*NL*
woman
come
for
if
she
had
n't
come
to
pray
?
Strether
's
reading
of
such
*NL*
matters
was
,
it
must
be
owned
,
confused
;
but
he
wondered
if
her
*NL*
attitude
were
some
congruous
fruit
of
absolution
,
of
``
indulgence
.
''
He
*NL*
knew
but
dimly
what
indulgence
,
in
such
a
place
,
might
mean
;
yet
he
*NL*
had
,
as
with
a
soft
sweep
,
a
vision
of
how
it
might
indeed
add
to
the
*NL*
zest
of
active
rites
.
All
this
was
a
good
deal
to
have
been
denoted
by
*NL*
a
mere
lurking
figure
who
was
nothing
to
him
;
but
,
the
last
thing
*NL*
before
leaving
the
church
,
he
had
the
surprise
of
a
still
deeper
*NL*
quickening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
dropped
upon
a
seat
halfway
down
the
nave
and
,
again
in
the
*NL*
museum
mood
,
was
trying
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
aloft
,
to
*NL*
reconstitute
a
past
,
to
reduce
it
in
fact
to
the
convenient
terms
of
*NL*
Victor
Hugo
,
whom
,
a
few
days
before
,
giving
the
rein
for
once
in
a
way
*NL*
to
the
joy
of
life
,
he
had
purchased
in
seventy
bound
volumes
,
a
*NL*
miracle
of
cheapness
,
parted
with
,
he
was
assured
by
the
shopman
,
at
*NL*
the
price
of
the
red-and-gold
alone
.
He
looked
,
doubtless
,
while
he
*NL*
played
his
eternal
nippers
over
Gothic
glooms
,
sufficiently
rapt
in
*NL*
reverence
;
but
what
his
thought
had
finally
bumped
against
was
the
*NL*
question
of
where
,
among
packed
accumulations
,
so
multiform
a
wedge
*NL*
would
be
able
to
enter
.
Were
seventy
volumes
in
red-and-gold
to
be
*NL*
perhaps
what
he
should
most
substantially
have
to
show
at
Woollett
as
*NL*
the
fruit
of
his
mission
?
It
was
a
possibility
that
held
him
a
*NL*
minute
--
held
him
till
he
happened
to
feel
that
some
one
,
unnoticed
,
had
*NL*
approached
him
and
paused
.
Turning
,
he
saw
that
a
lady
stood
there
as
*NL*
for
a
greeting
,
and
he
sprang
up
as
he
next
took
her
,
securely
,
for
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
who
appeared
to
have
recognised
him
as
she
passed
*NL*
near
him
on
her
way
to
the
door
.
She
checked
,
quickly
and
gaily
,
a
*NL*
certain
confusion
in
him
,
came
to
meet
it
,
turned
it
back
,
by
an
art
of
*NL*
her
own
;
the
confusion
having
threatened
him
as
he
knew
her
for
the
*NL*
person
he
had
lately
been
observing
.
She
was
the
lurking
figure
of
the
*NL*
dim
chapel
;
she
had
occupied
him
more
than
she
guessed
;
but
it
came
to
*NL*
him
in
time
,
luckily
,
that
he
need
n't
tell
her
and
that
no
harm
,
after
*NL*
all
,
had
been
done
.
She
herself
,
for
that
matter
,
straightway
showing
*NL*
she
felt
their
encounter
as
the
happiest
of
accidents
,
had
for
him
a
*NL*
``
You
come
here
too
?
''
that
despoiled
surprise
of
every
awkwardness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
often
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
love
this
place
,
but
I
'm
terrible
,
in
*NL*
general
,
for
churches
.
The
old
women
who
live
in
them
all
know
me
;
in
*NL*
fact
I
'm
already
myself
one
of
the
old
women
.
It
's
like
that
,
at
all
*NL*
events
,
that
I
foresee
I
shall
end
.
''
Looking
about
for
a
chair
,
so
*NL*
that
he
instantly
pulled
one
nearer
,
she
sat
down
with
him
again
to
the
*NL*
sound
of
an
``
Oh
,
I
like
so
much
your
also
being
fond
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
confessed
the
extent
of
his
feeling
,
though
she
left
the
object
*NL*
vague
;
and
he
was
struck
with
the
tact
,
the
taste
of
her
vagueness
,
*NL*
which
simply
took
for
granted
in
him
a
sense
of
beautiful
things
.
He
*NL*
was
conscious
of
how
much
it
was
affected
,
this
sense
,
by
something
*NL*
subdued
and
discreet
in
the
way
she
had
arranged
herself
for
her
*NL*
special
object
and
her
morning
walk
--
he
believed
her
to
have
come
on
*NL*
foot
;
the
way
her
slightly
thicker
veil
was
drawn
--
a
mere
touch
,
but
*NL*
everything
;
the
composed
gravity
of
her
dress
,
in
which
,
here
and
*NL*
there
,
a
dull
wine-colour
seemed
to
gleam
faintly
through
black
;
the
*NL*
charming
discretion
of
her
small
compact
head
;
the
quiet
note
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
,
of
her
folded
,
grey-gloved
hands
.
It
was
,
to
Strether
's
mind
,
as
*NL*
if
she
sat
on
her
own
ground
,
the
light
honours
of
which
,
at
an
open
*NL*
gate
,
she
thus
easily
did
him
,
while
all
the
vastness
and
mystery
of
*NL*
the
domain
stretched
off
behind
.
When
people
were
so
completely
in
*NL*
possession
they
could
be
extraordinarily
civil
;
and
our
friend
had
*NL*
indeed
at
this
hour
a
kind
of
revelation
of
her
heritage
.
She
was
*NL*
romantic
for
him
far
beyond
what
she
could
have
guessed
,
and
again
he
*NL*
found
his
small
comfort
in
the
conviction
that
,
subtle
though
she
was
,
*NL*
his
impression
must
remain
a
secret
from
her
.
The
thing
that
,
once
*NL*
more
,
made
him
uneasy
for
secrets
in
general
was
this
particular
*NL*
patience
she
could
have
with
his
own
want
of
colour
;
albeit
that
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
his
uneasiness
pretty
well
dropped
after
he
had
been
for
ten
*NL*
minutes
as
colourless
as
possible
and
at
the
same
time
as
responsive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moments
had
already
,
for
that
matter
,
drawn
their
deepest
tinge
*NL*
from
the
special
interest
excited
in
him
by
his
vision
of
his
*NL*
companion
's
identity
with
the
person
whose
attitude
before
the
*NL*
glimmering
altar
had
so
impressed
him
.
This
attitude
fitted
admirably
*NL*
into
the
stand
he
had
privately
taken
about
her
connexion
with
Chad
on
*NL*
the
last
occasion
of
his
seeing
them
together
.
It
helped
him
to
stick
*NL*
fast
at
the
point
he
had
then
reached
;
it
was
there
he
had
resolved
*NL*
that
he
WOULD
stick
,
and
at
no
moment
since
had
it
seemed
as
easy
to
do
*NL*
so
.
Unassailably
innocent
was
a
relation
that
could
make
one
of
the
*NL*
parties
to
it
so
carry
herself
.
If
it
was
n't
innocent
why
did
she
haunt
*NL*
the
churches
?
--
into
which
,
given
the
woman
he
could
believe
he
made
*NL*
out
,
she
would
never
have
come
to
flaunt
an
insolence
of
guilt
.
She
*NL*
haunted
them
for
continued
help
,
for
strength
,
for
peace
--
sublime
*NL*
support
which
,
if
one
were
able
to
look
at
it
so
,
she
found
from
day
to
*NL*
day
.
They
talked
,
in
low
easy
tones
and
with
lifted
lingering
looks
,
*NL*
about
the
great
monument
and
its
history
and
its
beauty
--
all
of
which
,
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
professed
,
came
to
her
most
in
the
other
,
the
outer
*NL*
view
.
``
We
'll
presently
,
after
we
go
,
''
she
said
,
``
walk
round
it
again
*NL*
if
you
like
.
I
'm
not
in
a
particular
hurry
,
and
it
will
be
pleasant
to
*NL*
look
at
it
well
with
you
.
''
He
had
spoken
of
the
great
romancer
and
the
*NL*
great
romance
,
and
of
what
,
to
his
imagination
,
they
had
done
for
the
*NL*
whole
,
mentioning
to
her
moreover
the
exorbitance
of
his
purchase
,
the
*NL*
seventy
blazing
volumes
that
were
so
out
of
proportion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
proportion
to
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
any
other
plunge
.
''
Yet
he
felt
even
as
he
spoke
how
at
that
*NL*
instant
he
was
plunging
.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
and
was
impatient
to
*NL*
get
into
the
air
;
for
his
purpose
was
a
purpose
to
be
uttered
outside
,
*NL*
and
he
had
a
fear
that
it
might
with
delay
still
slip
away
from
him
.
*NL*
She
however
took
her
time
;
she
drew
out
their
quiet
gossip
as
if
she
*NL*
had
wished
to
profit
by
their
meeting
,
and
this
confirmed
precisely
an
*NL*
interpretation
of
her
manner
,
of
her
mystery
.
While
she
rose
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
called
it
,
to
the
question
of
Victor
Hugo
,
her
voice
itself
,
*NL*
the
light
low
quaver
of
her
deference
to
the
solemnity
about
them
,
*NL*
seemed
to
make
her
words
mean
something
that
they
did
n't
mean
openly
.
*NL*
Help
,
strength
,
peace
,
a
sublime
support
--
she
had
n't
found
so
much
of
*NL*
these
things
as
that
the
amount
would
n't
be
sensibly
greater
for
any
*NL*
scrap
his
appearance
of
faith
in
her
might
enable
her
to
feel
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
Every
little
,
in
a
long
strain
,
helped
,
and
if
he
happened
to
*NL*
affect
her
as
a
firm
object
she
could
hold
on
by
,
he
would
n't
jerk
*NL*
himself
out
of
her
reach
.
People
in
difficulties
held
on
by
what
was
*NL*
nearest
,
and
he
was
perhaps
after
all
not
further
off
than
sources
of
*NL*
comfort
more
abstract
.
It
was
as
to
this
he
had
made
up
his
mind
;
he
*NL*
had
made
it
up
,
that
is
,
to
give
her
a
sign
.
The
sign
would
be
*NL*
that
--
though
it
was
her
own
affair
--
he
understood
;
the
sign
would
be
*NL*
that
--
though
it
was
her
own
affair
--
she
was
free
to
clutch
.
Since
she
*NL*
took
him
for
a
firm
object
--
much
as
he
might
to
his
own
sense
appear
at
*NL*
times
to
rock
--
he
would
do
his
best
to
BE
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
of
it
was
that
half
an
hour
later
they
were
seated
together
for
*NL*
an
early
luncheon
at
a
wonderful
,
a
delightful
house
of
entertainment
*NL*
on
the
left
bank
--
a
place
of
pilgrimage
for
the
knowing
,
they
were
both
*NL*
aware
,
the
knowing
who
came
,
for
its
great
renown
,
the
homage
of
*NL*
restless
days
,
from
the
other
end
of
the
town
.
Strether
had
already
*NL*
been
there
three
times
--
first
with
Miss
Gostrey
,
then
with
Chad
,
then
*NL*
with
Chad
again
and
with
Waymarsh
and
little
Bilham
,
all
of
whom
he
had
*NL*
himself
sagaciously
entertained
;
and
his
pleasure
was
deep
now
on
*NL*
learning
that
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
n't
yet
been
initiated
.
When
he
had
*NL*
said
as
they
strolled
round
the
church
,
by
the
river
,
acting
at
last
on
*NL*
what
,
within
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
,
``
Will
you
,
if
you
have
time
,
*NL*
come
to
dejeuner
with
me
somewhere
?
For
instance
,
if
you
know
it
,
over
*NL*
there
on
the
other
side
,
which
is
so
easy
a
walk
''
--
and
then
had
named
*NL*
the
place
;
when
he
had
done
this
she
stopped
short
as
for
quick
*NL*
intensity
,
and
yet
deep
difficulty
,
of
response
.
She
took
in
the
*NL*
proposal
as
if
it
were
almost
too
charming
to
be
true
;
and
there
had
*NL*
perhaps
never
yet
been
for
her
companion
so
unexpected
a
moment
of
*NL*
pride
--
so
fine
,
so
odd
a
case
,
at
any
rate
,
as
his
finding
himself
thus
*NL*
able
to
offer
to
a
person
in
such
universal
possession
a
new
,
a
rare
*NL*
amusement
.
She
had
heard
of
the
happy
spot
,
but
she
asked
him
in
reply
*NL*
to
a
further
question
how
in
the
world
he
could
suppose
her
to
have
*NL*
been
there
.
He
supposed
himself
to
have
supposed
that
Chad
might
have
*NL*
taken
her
,
and
she
guessed
this
the
next
moment
to
his
no
small
*NL*
discomfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
let
me
explain
,
''
she
smiled
,
``
that
I
do
n't
go
about
with
him
in
*NL*
public
;
I
never
have
such
chances
--
not
having
them
otherwise
--
and
it
's
*NL*
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
,
as
a
quiet
creature
living
in
my
hole
,
I
*NL*
adore
.
''
It
was
more
than
kind
of
him
to
have
thought
of
it
--
though
,
*NL*
frankly
,
if
he
asked
whether
she
had
time
she
had
n't
a
single
minute
.
*NL*
That
however
made
no
difference
--
she
'd
throw
everything
over
.
Every
*NL*
duty
at
home
,
domestic
,
maternal
,
social
,
awaited
her
;
but
it
was
a
*NL*
case
for
a
high
line
.
Her
affairs
would
go
to
smash
,
but
had
n't
one
a
*NL*
right
to
one
's
snatch
of
scandal
when
one
was
prepared
to
pay
?
It
was
*NL*
on
this
pleasant
basis
of
costly
disorder
,
consequently
,
that
they
*NL*
eventually
seated
themselves
,
on
either
side
of
a
small
table
,
at
a
*NL*
window
adjusted
to
the
busy
quay
and
the
shining
barge-burdened
Seine
;
*NL*
where
,
for
an
hour
,
in
the
matter
of
letting
himself
go
,
of
diving
*NL*
deep
,
Strether
was
to
feel
he
had
touched
bottom
.
He
was
to
feel
many
*NL*
things
on
this
occasion
,
and
one
of
the
first
of
them
was
that
he
had
*NL*
travelled
far
since
that
evening
in
London
,
before
the
theatre
,
when
*NL*
his
dinner
with
Maria
Gostrey
,
between
the
pink-shaded
candles
,
had
*NL*
struck
him
as
requiring
so
many
explanations
.
He
had
at
that
time
*NL*
gathered
them
in
,
the
explanations
--
he
had
stored
them
up
;
but
it
was
*NL*
at
present
as
if
he
had
either
soared
above
or
sunk
below
them
--
he
*NL*
could
n't
tell
which
;
he
could
somehow
think
of
none
that
did
n't
seem
to
*NL*
leave
the
appearance
of
collapse
and
cynicism
easier
for
him
than
*NL*
lucidity
.
How
could
he
wish
it
to
be
lucid
for
others
,
for
any
one
,
*NL*
that
he
,
for
the
hour
,
saw
reasons
enough
in
the
mere
way
the
bright
*NL*
clean
ordered
water-side
life
came
in
at
the
open
window
?
--
the
mere
way
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
opposite
him
over
their
intensely
white
table-linen
,
*NL*
their
omelette
aux
tomates
,
their
bottle
of
straw-coloured
Chablis
,
*NL*
thanked
him
for
everything
almost
with
the
smile
of
a
child
,
while
her
*NL*
grey
eyes
moved
in
and
out
of
their
talk
,
back
to
the
quarter
of
the
*NL*
warm
spring
air
,
in
which
early
summer
had
already
begun
to
throb
,
and
*NL*
then
back
again
to
his
face
and
their
human
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
human
questions
became
many
before
they
had
done
--
many
more
,
as
*NL*
one
after
the
other
came
up
,
than
our
friend
's
free
fancy
had
at
all
*NL*
foreseen
.
The
sense
he
had
had
before
,
the
sense
he
had
had
*NL*
repeatedly
,
the
sense
that
the
situation
was
running
away
with
him
,
had
*NL*
never
been
so
sharp
as
now
;
and
all
the
more
that
he
could
perfectly
*NL*
put
his
finger
on
the
moment
it
had
taken
the
bit
in
its
teeth
.
That
*NL*
accident
had
definitely
occurred
,
the
other
evening
,
after
Chad
's
*NL*
dinner
;
it
had
occurred
,
as
he
fully
knew
,
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
interposed
between
this
lady
and
her
child
,
when
he
suffered
himself
so
*NL*
to
discuss
with
her
a
matter
closely
concerning
them
that
her
own
*NL*
subtlety
,
marked
by
its
significant
``
Thank
you
!
''
instantly
sealed
the
*NL*
occasion
in
her
favour
.
Again
he
had
held
off
for
ten
days
,
but
the
*NL*
situation
had
continued
out
of
hand
in
spite
of
that
;
the
fact
that
it
*NL*
was
running
so
fast
being
indeed
just
WHY
he
had
held
off
.
What
had
*NL*
come
over
him
as
he
recognised
her
in
the
nave
of
the
church
was
that
*NL*
holding
off
could
be
but
a
losing
game
from
the
instant
she
was
worked
*NL*
for
not
only
by
her
subtlety
,
but
by
the
hand
of
fate
itself
.
If
all
*NL*
the
accidents
were
to
fight
on
her
side
--
and
by
the
actual
showing
they
*NL*
loomed
large
--
he
could
only
give
himself
up
.
This
was
what
he
had
done
*NL*
in
privately
deciding
then
and
there
to
propose
she
should
breakfast
*NL*
with
him
.
What
did
the
success
of
his
proposal
in
fact
resemble
but
the
*NL*
smash
in
which
a
regular
runaway
properly
ends
?
The
smash
was
their
*NL*
walk
,
their
dejeuner
,
their
omelette
,
the
Chablis
,
the
place
,
the
view
,
*NL*
their
present
talk
and
his
present
pleasure
in
it
--
to
say
nothing
,
*NL*
wonder
of
wonders
,
of
her
own
.
To
this
tune
and
nothing
less
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
was
his
surrender
made
good
.
It
sufficiently
lighted
up
*NL*
at
least
the
folly
of
holding
off
.
Ancient
proverbs
sounded
,
for
his
*NL*
memory
,
in
the
tone
of
their
words
and
the
clink
of
their
glasses
,
in
*NL*
the
hum
of
the
town
and
the
plash
of
the
river
.
It
WAS
clearly
better
*NL*
to
suffer
as
a
sheep
than
as
a
lamb
.
One
might
as
well
perish
by
the
*NL*
sword
as
by
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maria
's
still
away
?
''
--
that
was
the
first
thing
she
had
asked
him
;
and
*NL*
when
he
had
found
the
frankness
to
be
cheerful
about
it
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
meaning
he
knew
her
to
attach
to
Miss
Gostrey
's
absence
,
she
had
gone
*NL*
on
to
enquire
if
he
did
n't
tremendously
miss
her
.
There
were
reasons
*NL*
that
made
him
by
no
means
sure
,
yet
he
nevertheless
answered
*NL*
``
Tremendously
''
;
which
she
took
in
as
if
it
were
all
she
had
wished
to
*NL*
prove
.
Then
,
``
A
man
in
trouble
MUST
be
possessed
somehow
of
a
woman
,
''
*NL*
she
said
;
``
if
she
does
n't
come
in
one
way
she
comes
in
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
call
me
a
man
in
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
because
that
's
the
way
you
strike
me
.
''
She
spoke
ever
so
gently
*NL*
and
as
if
with
all
fear
of
wounding
him
while
she
sat
partaking
of
his
*NL*
bounty
.
``
ARE
n't
you
in
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
himself
colour
at
the
question
,
and
then
hated
that
--
hated
to
*NL*
pass
for
anything
so
idiotic
as
woundable
.
Woundable
by
Chad
's
lady
,
*NL*
in
respect
to
whom
he
had
come
out
with
such
a
fund
of
*NL*
indifference
--
was
he
already
at
that
point
?
Perversely
,
none
the
less
,
*NL*
his
pause
gave
a
strange
air
of
truth
to
her
supposition
;
and
what
was
*NL*
he
in
fact
but
disconcerted
at
having
struck
her
just
in
the
way
he
had
*NL*
most
dreamed
of
not
doing
?
``
I
'm
not
in
trouble
yet
,
''
he
at
last
*NL*
smiled
.
``
I
'm
not
in
trouble
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
always
so
.
But
that
you
sufficiently
know
.
''
She
was
a
*NL*
woman
who
,
between
courses
,
could
be
graceful
with
her
elbows
on
the
*NL*
table
.
It
was
a
posture
unknown
to
Mrs.
Newsome
,
but
it
was
easy
for
a
*NL*
femme
du
monde
.
``
Yes
--
I
am
`
now
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
question
you
put
to
me
,
''
he
presently
returned
,
``
the
night
*NL*
of
Chad
's
dinner
.
I
did
n't
answer
it
then
,
and
it
has
been
very
*NL*
handsome
of
you
not
to
have
sought
an
occasion
for
pressing
me
about
it
*NL*
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
instantly
all
there
.
``
Of
course
I
know
what
you
allude
to
.
I
*NL*
asked
you
what
you
had
meant
by
saying
,
the
day
you
came
to
see
me
,
*NL*
just
before
you
left
me
,
that
you
'd
save
me
.
And
you
then
said
--
at
our
*NL*
friend
's
--
that
you
'd
have
really
to
wait
to
see
,
for
yourself
,
what
you
*NL*
did
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
asked
for
time
,
''
said
Strether
.
``
And
it
sounds
now
,
as
you
put
*NL*
it
,
like
a
very
ridiculous
speech
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
murmured
--
she
was
full
of
attenuation
.
But
she
had
another
*NL*
thought
.
``
If
it
does
sound
ridiculous
why
do
you
deny
that
you
're
in
*NL*
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
if
I
were
,
''
he
replied
,
``
it
would
n't
be
the
trouble
of
fearing
*NL*
ridicule
.
I
do
n't
fear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
--
now
.
''
And
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
`
now
'
!
''
she
laughed
across
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
precisely
that
it
fully
comes
to
me
at
present
that
I
've
*NL*
kept
you
long
enough
.
I
know
by
this
time
,
at
any
rate
,
what
I
meant
*NL*
by
my
speech
;
and
I
really
knew
it
the
night
of
Chad
's
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
was
difficult
at
the
moment
.
I
had
already
at
that
moment
*NL*
done
something
for
you
,
in
the
sense
of
what
I
had
said
the
day
I
went
*NL*
to
see
you
;
but
I
was
n't
then
sure
of
the
importance
I
might
represent
*NL*
this
as
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
all
eagerness
.
``
And
you
're
sure
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
see
that
,
practically
,
I
've
done
for
you

had
done
for
you
when
*NL*
you
put
me
your
question
--
all
that
it
's
as
yet
possible
to
me
to
do
.
I
*NL*
feel
now
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
it
may
go
further
than
I
thought
.
What
I
*NL*
did
after
my
visit
to
you
,
''
he
explained
,
``
was
to
write
straight
off
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
about
you
,
and
I
'm
at
last
,
from
one
day
to
the
other
,
*NL*
expecting
her
answer
.
It
's
this
answer
that
will
represent
,
as
I
*NL*
believe
,
the
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Patient
and
beautiful
was
her
interest
.
``
I
see
--
the
consequences
of
*NL*
your
speaking
for
me
.
''
And
she
waited
as
if
not
to
hustle
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
acknowledged
it
by
immediately
going
on
.
``
The
question
,
you
*NL*
understand
,
was
HOW
I
should
save
you
.
Well
,
I
'm
trying
it
by
thus
*NL*
letting
her
know
that
I
consider
you
worth
saving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
I
see
.
''
Her
eagerness
broke
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
thank
you
enough
?
''
He
could
n't
tell
her
that
,
however
,
and
*NL*
she
quickly
pursued
.
``
You
do
really
,
for
yourself
,
consider
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
only
answer
at
first
was
to
help
her
to
the
dish
that
had
been
*NL*
freshly
put
before
them
.
``
I
've
written
to
her
again
since
then
--
I
've
*NL*
left
her
in
no
doubt
of
what
I
think

I
've
told
her
all
about
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks

not
so
much

`
All
about

me
,
''
she
went
on
--
``
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
it
seems
to
me
you
've
done
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
and
you
might
have
added
all
it
seems
to
ME
!
''
She
laughed
again
,
*NL*
while
she
took
up
her
knife
and
fork
,
as
in
the
cheer
of
these
*NL*
assurances
.
``
But
you
're
not
sure
how
she
'll
take
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
not
pretend
I
'm
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voila
.
''
And
she
waited
a
moment
.
``
I
wish
you
'd
tell
me
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Strether
with
a
slightly
strained
smile
,
``
all
that
need
*NL*
concern
you
about
her
is
that
she
's
really
a
grand
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
seemed
to
demur
.
``
Is
that
all
that
need
concern
me
*NL*
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Strether
neglected
the
question
.
``
Has
n't
Chad
talked
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
his
mother
?
Yes
,
a
great
deal
--
immensely
.
But
not
from
your
point
*NL*
of
view

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
,
''
our
friend
returned
,
``
have
said
any
ill
of
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
bit
.
He
has
given
me
,
like
you
,
the
assurance
that
*NL*
she
's
really
grand
.
But
her
being
really
grand
is
somehow
just
what
*NL*
has
n't
seemed
to
simplify
our
case
.
Nothing
,
''
she
continued
,
``
is
*NL*
further
from
me
than
to
wish
to
say
a
word
against
her
;
but
of
course
I
*NL*
feel
how
little
she
can
like
being
told
of
her
owing
me
anything
.
No
*NL*
woman
ever
enjoys
such
an
obligation
to
another
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
proposition
Strether
could
n't
contradict
.
``
And
yet
what
*NL*
other
way
could
I
have
expressed
to
her
what
I
felt
?
It
's
what
there
*NL*
was
most
to
say
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
then
that
she
WILL
be
good
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
I
'm
waiting
to
see
.
But
I
've
little
doubt
she
would
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
if
she
could
comfortably
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
strike
her
as
a
happy
,
a
beneficent
thought
.
``
Oh
then
*NL*
could
n't
that
be
managed
?
Would
n't
she
come
out
?
Would
n't
she
if
you
*NL*
so
put
it
to
her
?
DID
you
by
any
possibility
?
''
she
faintly
quavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
''
--
he
was
prompt
.
``
Not
that
.
It
would
be
,
much
more
,
to
give
an
*NL*
account
of
you
that
--
since
there
's
no
question
of
YOUR
paying
the
*NL*
visit
--
I
should
go
home
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
instantly
made
her
graver
.
``
And
are
you
thinking
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
all
the
while
,
naturally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
with
us
--
stay
with
us
!
''
she
exclaimed
on
this
.
``
That
's
your
only
*NL*
way
to
make
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
make
sure
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
he
does
n't
break
up
.
You
did
n't
come
out
to
do
that
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
it
depend
,
''
Strether
returned
after
a
moment
,
``
on
what
you
*NL*
mean
by
breaking
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
know
well
enough
what
I
mean
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
silence
seemed
again
for
a
little
to
denote
an
understanding
.
``
You
*NL*
take
for
granted
remarkable
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
--
to
the
extent
that
I
do
n't
take
for
granted
vulgar
ones
.
*NL*
You
're
perfectly
capable
of
seeing
that
what
you
came
out
for
was
n't
*NL*
really
at
all
to
do
what
you
'd
now
have
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
it
's
perfectly
simple
,
''
Strether
good-humouredly
pleaded
.
``
I
've
*NL*
had
but
one
thing
to
do
--
to
put
our
case
before
him
.
To
put
it
as
it
*NL*
could
only
be
put
here
on
the
spot
--
by
personal
pressure
.
My
dear
*NL*
lady
,
''
he
lucidly
pursued
,
``
my
work
,
you
see
,
is
really
done
,
and
my
*NL*
reasons
for
staying
on
even
another
day
are
none
of
the
best
.
Chad
's
*NL*
in
possession
of
our
case
and
professes
to
do
it
full
justice
.
What
*NL*
remains
is
with
himself
.
I
've
had
my
rest
,
my
amusement
and
*NL*
refreshment
;
I
've
had
,
as
we
say
at
Woollett
,
a
lovely
time
.
Nothing
*NL*
in
it
has
been
more
lovely
than
this
happy
meeting
with
you
--
in
these
*NL*
fantastic
conditions
to
which
you
've
so
delightfully
consented
.
I
've
a
*NL*
sense
of
success
.
It
's
what
I
wanted
.
My
getting
all
this
good
is
*NL*
what
Chad
has
waited
for
,
and
I
gather
that
if
I
'm
ready
to
go
he
's
the
*NL*
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
with
a
finer
deeper
wisdom
.
``
You
're
not
ready
.
If
*NL*
you
're
ready
why
did
you
write
to
Mrs.
Newsome
in
the
sense
you
've
*NL*
mentioned
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
considered
.
``
I
sha
n't
go
before
I
hear
from
her
.
You
're
too
*NL*
much
afraid
of
her
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
produced
between
them
a
long
look
from
which
neither
shrank
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
you
believe
that
--
believe
I
've
not
really
reason
to
fear
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
capable
of
great
generosity
,
''
Strether
presently
stated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
let
her
trust
me
a
little
.
That
's
all
I
ask
.
Let
her
*NL*
recognise
in
spite
of
everything
what
I
've
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
remember
,
''
our
friend
replied
,
``
that
she
ca
n't
effectually
*NL*
recognise
it
without
seeing
it
for
herself
.
Let
Chad
go
over
and
show
*NL*
her
what
you
've
done
,
and
let
him
plead
with
her
there
for
it
and
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
for
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
measured
the
depth
of
this
suggestion
.
``
Do
you
give
me
your
word
*NL*
of
honour
that
if
she
once
has
him
there
she
wo
n't
do
her
best
to
marry
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
companion
,
this
enquiry
,
look
again
a
while
out
at
the
*NL*
view
;
after
which
he
spoke
without
sharpness
.
``
When
she
sees
for
*NL*
herself
what
he
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
already
broken
in
.
``
It
's
when
she
sees
for
herself
what
he
*NL*
is
that
she
'll
want
to
marry
him
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
attitude
,
that
of
due
deference
to
what
she
said
,
permitted
*NL*
him
to
attend
for
a
minute
to
his
luncheon
.
``
I
doubt
if
that
will
come
*NL*
off
.
It
wo
n't
be
easy
to
make
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
easy
if
he
remains
there
--
and
he
'll
remain
for
the
money
.
*NL*
The
money
appears
to
be
,
as
a
probability
,
so
hideously
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Strether
presently
concluded
,
``
nothing
COULD
really
hurt
you
*NL*
but
his
marrying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
strange
light
laugh
.
``
Putting
aside
what
may
really
hurt
*NL*
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
friend
looked
at
her
as
if
he
had
thought
of
that
too
.
``
The
*NL*
question
will
come
up
,
of
course
,
of
the
future
that
you
yourself
offer
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
leaning
back
now
,
but
she
fully
faced
him
.
``
Well
,
let
it
come
*NL*
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
point
is
that
it
's
for
Chad
to
make
of
it
what
he
can
.
His
being
*NL*
proof
against
marriage
will
show
what
he
does
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
IS
proof
,
yes
''
--
she
accepted
the
proposition
.
``
But
for
myself
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
``
the
question
is
what
YOU
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
I
make
nothing
.
It
's
not
my
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
.
It
's
just
there
that
,
since
you
've
taken
it
up
and
*NL*
are
committed
to
it
,
it
most
intensely
becomes
yours
.
You
're
not
*NL*
saving
me
,
I
take
it
,
for
your
interest
in
myself
,
but
for
your
*NL*
interest
in
our
friend
.
The
one
's
at
any
rate
wholly
dependent
on
the
*NL*
other
.
You
ca
n't
in
honour
not
see
me
through
,
''
she
wound
up
,
``
because
*NL*
you
ca
n't
in
honour
not
see
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
and
beautiful
to
him
was
her
quiet
soft
acuteness
.
The
thing
*NL*
that
most
moved
him
was
really
that
she
was
so
deeply
serious
.
She
had
*NL*
none
of
the
portentous
forms
of
it
,
but
he
had
never
come
in
contact
,
*NL*
it
struck
him
,
with
a
force
brought
to
so
fine
a
head
.
Mrs.
Newsome
,
*NL*
goodness
knew
,
was
serious
;
but
it
was
nothing
to
this
.
He
took
it
all
*NL*
in
,
he
saw
it
all
together
.
``
No
,
''
he
mused
,
``
I
ca
n't
in
honour
not
see
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
affected
him
as
with
an
exquisite
light
.
``
You
WILL
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
she
pushed
back
her
chair
and
was
the
next
moment
on
her
feet
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
she
said
with
her
hand
held
out
to
him
across
the
table
*NL*
and
with
no
less
a
meaning
in
the
words
than
her
lips
had
so
*NL*
particularly
given
them
after
Chad
's
dinner
.
The
golden
nail
she
had
*NL*
then
driven
in
pierced
a
good
inch
deeper
.
Yet
he
reflected
that
he
*NL*
himself
had
only
meanwhile
done
what
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
on
the
*NL*
same
occasion
.
So
far
as
the
essence
of
the
matter
went
he
had
simply
*NL*
stood
fast
on
the
spot
on
which
he
had
then
planted
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
three
days
after
this
a
communication
from
America
,
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
scrap
of
blue
paper
folded
and
gummed
,
not
reaching
him
*NL*
through
his
bankers
,
but
delivered
at
his
hotel
by
a
small
boy
in
*NL*
uniform
,
who
,
under
instructions
from
the
concierge
,
approached
him
as
*NL*
he
slowly
paced
the
little
court
.
It
was
the
evening
hour
,
but
*NL*
daylight
was
long
now
and
Paris
more
than
ever
penetrating
.
The
scent
*NL*
of
flowers
was
in
the
streets
,
he
had
the
whiff
of
violets
perpetually
*NL*
in
his
nose
;
and
he
had
attached
himself
to
sounds
and
suggestions
,
*NL*
vibrations
of
the
air
,
human
and
dramatic
,
he
imagined
,
as
they
were
*NL*
not
in
other
places
,
that
came
out
for
him
more
and
more
as
the
mild
*NL*
afternoons
deepened
--
a
far-off
hum
,
a
sharp
near
click
on
the
asphalt
,
*NL*
a
voice
calling
,
replying
,
somewhere
and
as
full
of
tone
as
an
actor
's
*NL*
in
a
play
.
He
was
to
dine
at
home
,
as
usual
,
with
Waymarsh
--
they
had
*NL*
settled
to
that
for
thrift
and
simplicity
;
and
he
now
hung
about
before
*NL*
his
friend
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
his
telegram
in
the
court
,
standing
still
a
long
time
where
he
*NL*
had
opened
it
and
giving
five
minutes
afterwards
to
the
renewed
study
*NL*
of
it
.
At
last
,
quickly
,
he
crumpled
it
up
as
if
to
get
it
out
of
the
*NL*
way
;
in
spite
of
which
,
however
,
he
kept
it
there
--
still
kept
it
when
,
*NL*
at
the
end
of
another
turn
,
he
had
dropped
into
a
chair
placed
near
a
*NL*
small
table
.
Here
,
with
his
scrap
of
paper
compressed
in
his
fist
and
*NL*
further
concealed
by
his
folding
his
arms
tight
,
he
sat
for
some
time
*NL*
in
thought
,
gazed
before
him
so
straight
that
Waymarsh
appeared
and
*NL*
approached
him
without
catching
his
eye
.
The
latter
in
fact
,
struck
*NL*
with
his
appearance
,
looked
at
him
hard
for
a
single
instant
and
then
,
*NL*
as
if
determined
to
that
course
by
some
special
vividness
in
it
,
*NL*
dropped
back
into
the
salon
de
lecture
without
addressing
him
.
But
the
*NL*
pilgrim
from
Milrose
permitted
himself
still
to
observe
the
scene
from
*NL*
behind
the
clear
glass
plate
of
that
retreat
.
Strether
ended
,
as
he
*NL*
sat
,
by
a
fresh
scrutiny
of
his
compressed
missive
,
which
he
smoothed
*NL*
out
carefully
again
as
he
placed
it
on
his
table
.
There
it
remained
*NL*
for
some
minutes
,
until
,
at
last
looking
up
,
he
saw
Waymarsh
watching
*NL*
him
from
within
.
It
was
on
this
that
their
eyes
met
--
met
for
a
moment
*NL*
during
which
neither
moved
.
But
Strether
then
got
up
,
folding
his
*NL*
telegram
more
carefully
and
putting
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
the
friends
were
seated
together
at
dinner
;
but
*NL*
Strether
had
meanwhile
said
nothing
about
it
,
and
they
eventually
*NL*
parted
,
after
coffee
in
the
court
,
with
nothing
said
on
either
side
.
*NL*
Our
friend
had
moreover
the
consciousness
that
even
less
than
usual
was
*NL*
on
this
occasion
said
between
them
,
so
that
it
was
almost
as
if
each
*NL*
had
been
waiting
for
something
from
the
other
.
Waymarsh
had
always
*NL*
more
or
less
the
air
of
sitting
at
the
door
of
his
tent
,
and
silence
,
*NL*
after
so
many
weeks
,
had
come
to
play
its
part
in
their
concert
.
This
*NL*
note
indeed
,
to
Strether
's
sense
,
had
lately
taken
a
fuller
tone
,
and
*NL*
it
was
his
fancy
to-night
that
they
had
never
quite
so
drawn
it
out
.
*NL*
Yet
it
befell
,
none
the
less
that
he
closed
the
door
to
confidence
when
*NL*
his
companion
finally
asked
him
if
there
were
anything
particular
the
*NL*
matter
with
him
.
``
Nothing
,
''
he
replied
,
``
more
than
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
however
,
at
an
early
hour
,
he
found
occasion
to
give
an
*NL*
answer
more
in
consonance
with
the
facts
.
What
was
the
matter
had
*NL*
continued
to
be
so
all
the
previous
evening
,
the
first
hours
of
which
,
*NL*
after
dinner
,
in
his
room
,
he
had
devoted
to
the
copious
composition
of
*NL*
a
letter
.
He
had
quitted
Waymarsh
for
this
purpose
,
leaving
him
to
his
*NL*
own
resources
with
less
ceremony
than
their
wont
,
but
finally
coming
*NL*
down
again
with
his
letter
unconcluded
and
going
forth
into
the
streets
*NL*
without
enquiry
for
his
comrade
.
He
had
taken
a
long
vague
walk
,
and
*NL*
one
o'clock
had
struck
before
his
return
and
his
re-ascent
to
his
room
*NL*
by
the
aid
of
the
glimmering
candle-end
left
for
him
on
the
shelf
*NL*
outside
the
porter
's
lodge
.
He
had
possessed
himself
,
on
closing
his
*NL*
door
,
of
the
numerous
loose
sheets
of
his
unfinished
composition
,
and
*NL*
then
,
without
reading
them
over
,
had
torn
them
into
small
pieces
.
He
*NL*
had
thereupon
slept
--
as
if
it
had
been
in
some
measure
thanks
to
that
*NL*
sacrifice
--
the
sleep
of
the
just
,
and
had
prolonged
his
rest
*NL*
considerably
beyond
his
custom
.
Thus
it
was
that
when
,
between
nine
*NL*
and
ten
,
the
tap
of
the
knob
of
a
walking-stick
sounded
on
his
door
,
he
*NL*
had
not
yet
made
himself
altogether
presentable
.
Chad
Newsome
's
bright
*NL*
deep
voice
determined
quickly
enough
none
the
less
the
admission
of
the
*NL*
visitor
.
The
little
blue
paper
of
the
evening
before
,
plainly
an
*NL*
object
the
more
precious
for
its
escape
from
premature
destruction
,
now
*NL*
lay
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
,
smoothed
out
afresh
and
kept
from
*NL*
blowing
away
by
the
superincumbent
weight
of
his
watch
.
Chad
,
looking
*NL*
about
with
careless
and
competent
criticism
,
as
he
looked
wherever
he
*NL*
went
immediately
espied
it
and
permitted
himself
to
fix
it
for
a
moment
*NL*
rather
hard
.
After
which
he
turned
his
eyes
to
his
host
.
``
It
has
come
*NL*
then
at
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
paused
in
the
act
of
pinning
his
necktie
.
``
Then
you
know
--
?
*NL*
You
've
had
one
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
had
nothing
,
and
I
only
know
what
I
see
.
I
see
that
thing
*NL*
and
I
guess
.
Well
,
''
he
added
,
``
it
comes
as
pat
as
in
a
play
,
for
I
've
*NL*
precisely
turned
up
this
morning
--
as
I
would
have
done
yesterday
,
but
*NL*
it
was
impossible
--
to
take
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
take
me
?
''
Strether
had
turned
again
to
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Back
,
at
last
,
as
I
promised
.
I
'm
ready
--
I
've
really
been
ready
this
*NL*
month
.
I
've
only
been
waiting
for
you
--
as
was
perfectly
right
.
But
*NL*
you
're
better
now
;
you
're
safe
--
I
see
that
for
myself
;
you
've
got
all
*NL*
your
good
.
You
're
looking
,
this
morning
,
as
fit
as
a
flea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
at
his
glass
,
finished
dressing
;
consulting
that
witness
*NL*
moreover
on
this
last
opinion
.
WAS
he
looking
preternaturally
fit
?
*NL*
There
was
something
in
it
perhaps
for
Chad
's
wonderful
eye
,
but
he
had
*NL*
felt
himself
for
hours
rather
in
pieces
.
Such
a
judgement
,
however
,
*NL*
was
after
all
but
a
contribution
to
his
resolve
;
it
testified
*NL*
unwittingly
to
his
wisdom
.
He
was
still
firmer
,
apparently
--
since
it
*NL*
shone
in
him
as
a
light
--
than
he
had
flattered
himself
.
His
firmness
*NL*
indeed
was
slightly
compromised
,
as
he
faced
about
to
his
friend
,
by
*NL*
the
way
this
very
personage
looked
--
though
the
case
would
of
course
*NL*
have
been
worse
had
n't
the
secret
of
personal
magnificence
been
at
*NL*
every
hour
Chad
's
unfailing
possession
.
There
he
was
in
all
the
*NL*
pleasant
morning
freshness
of
it
--
strong
and
sleek
and
gay
,
easy
and
*NL*
fragrant
and
fathomless
,
with
happy
health
in
his
colour
,
and
pleasant
*NL*
silver
in
his
thick
young
hair
,
and
the
right
word
for
everything
on
*NL*
the
lips
that
his
clear
brownness
caused
to
show
as
red
.
He
had
never
*NL*
struck
Strether
as
personally
such
a
success
;
it
was
as
if
now
,
for
his
*NL*
definite
surrender
,
he
had
gathered
himself
vividly
together
.
This
,
*NL*
sharply
and
rather
strangely
,
was
the
form
in
which
he
was
to
be
*NL*
presented
to
Woollett
.
Our
friend
took
him
in
again
--
he
was
always
*NL*
taking
him
in
and
yet
finding
that
parts
of
him
still
remained
out
;
*NL*
though
even
thus
his
image
showed
through
a
mist
of
other
things
.
``
I
've
*NL*
had
a
cable
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
from
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
,
my
dear
man
.
I
hope
she
's
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
No
--
she
's
not
well
,
I
'm
sorry
to
have
to
tell
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
I
must
have
had
the
instinct
of
it
.
All
the
more
*NL*
reason
then
that
we
should
start
straight
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
now
got
together
hat
,
gloves
and
stick
,
but
Chad
had
*NL*
dropped
on
the
sofa
as
if
to
show
where
he
wished
to
make
his
point
.
He
*NL*
kept
observing
his
companion
's
things
;
he
might
have
been
judging
how
*NL*
quickly
they
could
be
packed
.
He
might
even
have
wished
to
hint
that
*NL*
he
'd
send
his
own
servant
to
assist
.
``
What
do
you
mean
,
''
Strether
*NL*
enquired
,
``
by
`
straight
off
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
by
one
of
next
week
's
boats
.
Everything
at
this
season
goes
out
so
*NL*
light
that
berths
will
be
easy
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
in
his
hand
his
telegram
,
which
he
had
kept
there
after
*NL*
attaching
his
watch
,
and
he
now
offered
it
to
Chad
,
who
,
however
,
with
*NL*
an
odd
movement
,
declined
to
take
it
.
``
Thanks
,
I
'd
rather
not
.
Your
*NL*
correspondence
with
Mother
's
your
own
affair
.
I
'm
only
WITH
you
both
*NL*
on
it
,
whatever
it
is
.
''
Strether
,
at
this
,
while
their
eyes
met
,
*NL*
slowly
folded
the
missive
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
;
after
which
,
before
*NL*
he
had
spoken
again
,
Chad
broke
fresh
ground
.
``
Has
Miss
Gostrey
come
*NL*
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Strether
presently
spoke
it
was
n't
in
answer
.
``
It
's
not
,
I
*NL*
gather
,
that
your
mother
's
physically
ill
;
her
health
,
on
the
whole
,
*NL*
this
spring
,
seems
to
have
been
better
than
usual
.
But
she
's
worried
,
*NL*
she
's
anxious
,
and
it
appears
to
have
risen
within
the
last
few
days
to
*NL*
a
climax
.
We
've
tired
out
,
between
us
,
her
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
it
is
n't
YOU
!
''
Chad
generously
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
--
it
IS
me
.
''
Strether
was
mild
and
melancholy
,
but
*NL*
firm
.
He
saw
it
far
away
and
over
his
companion
's
head
.
``
It
's
very
*NL*
particularly
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
all
the
more
reason
.
Marchons
,
marchons
!
''
said
the
young
*NL*
man
gaily
.
His
host
,
however
,
at
this
,
but
continued
to
stand
agaze
;
*NL*
and
he
had
the
next
thing
repeated
his
question
of
a
moment
before
.
*NL*
``
Has
Miss
Gostrey
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
two
days
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
've
seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
'm
to
see
her
to-day
.
''
But
Strether
would
n't
linger
now
on
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
.
``
Your
mother
sends
me
an
ultimatum
.
If
I
ca
n't
bring
you
I
'm
*NL*
to
leave
you
;
I
'm
to
come
at
any
rate
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
you
CAN
bring
me
now
,
''
Chad
,
from
his
sofa
,
reassuringly
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
a
pause
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
understand
you
.
Why
was
it
*NL*
that
,
more
than
a
month
ago
,
you
put
it
to
me
so
urgently
to
let
Madame
*NL*
de
Vionnet
speak
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
'
?
''
Chad
considered
,
but
he
had
it
at
his
fingers
'
ends
.
``
Why
*NL*
but
because
I
knew
how
well
she
'd
do
it
?
It
was
the
way
to
keep
you
*NL*
quiet
and
,
to
that
extent
,
do
you
good
.
Besides
,
''
he
happily
and
*NL*
comfortably
explained
,
``
I
wanted
you
really
to
know
her
and
to
get
the
*NL*
impression
of
her
--
and
you
see
the
good
that
HAS
done
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
the
way
she
has
spoken
for
you
,
all
the
*NL*
same
--
so
far
as
I
've
given
her
a
chance
--
has
only
made
me
feel
how
much
*NL*
she
wishes
to
keep
you
.
If
you
make
nothing
of
that
I
do
n't
see
why
*NL*
you
wanted
me
to
listen
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
my
dear
man
,
''
Chad
exclaimed
,
``
I
make
everything
of
it
!
How
can
*NL*
you
doubt
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
only
because
you
come
to
me
this
morning
with
your
signal
to
*NL*
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
stared
,
then
gave
a
laugh
.
``
And
is
n't
my
signal
to
start
just
*NL*
what
you
've
been
waiting
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
debated
;
he
took
another
turn
.
``
This
last
month
I
've
been
*NL*
awaiting
,
I
think
,
more
than
anything
else
,
the
message
I
have
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
you
've
been
afraid
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
doing
my
business
in
my
own
way
.
And
I
suppose
your
*NL*
present
announcement
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
``
is
n't
merely
the
result
of
*NL*
your
sense
of
what
I
've
expected
.
Otherwise
you
would
n't
have
put
me
*NL*
in
relation
--
''
But
he
paused
,
pulling
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Chad
rose
.
``
Ah
HER
wanting
me
not
to
go
has
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
it
!
It
's
only
because
she
's
afraid
--
afraid
of
the
way
that
,
over
there
,
*NL*
I
may
get
caught
.
But
her
fear
's
groundless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
met
again
his
companion
's
sufficiently
searching
look
.
``
Are
you
*NL*
tired
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
gave
him
in
reply
to
this
,
with
a
movement
of
the
head
,
the
*NL*
strangest
slow
smile
he
had
ever
had
from
him
.
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
immediately
,
on
Strether
's
imagination
,
so
deep
and
soft
an
*NL*
effect
that
our
friend
could
only
for
the
moment
keep
it
before
him
.
*NL*
``
Never
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
Chad
obligingly
and
serenely
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
his
companion
take
several
more
steps
.
``
Then
YOU
'RE
not
*NL*
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
pulled
up
again
.
``
Afraid
to
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
looked
brightly
amazed
.
``
You
want
me
now
to
`
stay
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
n't
immediately
sail
the
Pococks
will
immediately
come
out
.
*NL*
That
's
what
I
mean
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
by
your
mother
's
ultimatum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
showed
a
still
livelier
,
but
not
an
alarmed
interest
.
``
She
has
*NL*
turned
on
Sarah
and
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
joined
him
for
an
instant
in
the
vision
.
``
Oh
and
you
may
be
*NL*
sure
Mamie
.
THAT
'S
whom
she
's
turning
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
also
Chad
saw
--
he
laughed
out
.
``
Mamie
--
to
corrupt
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
she
's
very
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
already
more
than
once
told
me
.
I
should
like
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
happy
and
easy
,
something
above
all
unconscious
,
in
the
way
*NL*
he
said
this
,
brought
home
again
to
his
companion
the
facility
of
his
*NL*
attitude
and
the
enviability
of
his
state
.
``
See
her
then
by
all
means
.
*NL*
And
consider
too
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
``
that
you
really
give
your
sister
*NL*
a
lift
in
letting
her
come
to
you
.
You
give
her
a
couple
of
months
of
*NL*
Paris
,
which
she
has
n't
seen
,
if
I
'm
not
mistaken
,
since
just
after
she
*NL*
was
married
,
and
which
I
'm
sure
she
wants
but
the
pretext
to
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
listened
,
but
with
all
his
own
knowledge
of
the
world
.
``
She
has
*NL*
had
it
,
the
pretext
,
these
several
years
,
yet
she
has
never
taken
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
YOU
?
''
Strether
after
an
instant
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
--
the
lone
exile
.
And
whom
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Chad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
mean
ME
.
I
'm
her
pretext
.
That
is
--
for
it
comes
to
the
same
*NL*
thing
--
I
'm
your
mother
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
,
''
Chad
asked
,
``
does
n't
Mother
come
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
gave
him
a
long
look
.
``
Should
you
like
her
to
?
''
And
as
he
*NL*
for
the
moment
said
nothing
:
``
It
's
perfectly
open
to
you
to
cable
for
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
continued
to
think
.
``
Will
she
come
if
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
possibly
.
But
try
,
and
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
YOU
try
?
''
Chad
after
a
moment
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
thought
.
``
Do
n't
desire
her
presence
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
faced
the
question
,
and
his
answer
was
the
more
emphatic
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
it
off
,
my
dear
boy
,
on
ME
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
see
what
you
mean
.
I
'm
sure
you
'd
behave
beautifully
but
you
*NL*
DO
N'T
want
to
see
her
.
So
I
wo
n't
play
you
that
trick
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Strether
declared
,
``
I
should
n't
call
it
a
trick
.
You
've
a
*NL*
perfect
right
,
and
it
would
be
perfectly
straight
of
you
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
added
in
a
different
tone
:
``
You
'd
have
moreover
,
in
the
person
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
a
very
interesting
relation
prepared
for
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
,
on
this
proposition
,
continued
to
meet
,
but
Chad
's
pleasant
*NL*
and
bold
,
never
flinched
for
a
moment
.
He
got
up
at
last
and
he
said
*NL*
something
with
which
Strether
was
struck
.
``
She
would
n't
understand
*NL*
her
,
but
that
makes
no
difference
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
would
like
to
see
*NL*
her
.
She
'd
like
to
be
charming
to
her
.
She
believes
she
could
work
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
a
moment
,
affected
by
this
,
but
finally
turning
away
.
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
quite
sure
?
''
Chad
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
risk
it
if
you
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
who
uttered
this
with
serenity
,
had
urged
a
plea
for
their
*NL*
now
getting
into
the
air
;
but
the
young
man
still
waited
.
``
Have
you
*NL*
sent
your
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
done
nothing
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
waiting
to
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
waiting
''
--
and
Chad
,
with
this
,
had
a
smile
for
him
--
``
to
see
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
even
Miss
Gostrey
.
I
was
n't
waiting
to
see
any
one

I
had
*NL*
only
waited
,
till
now
,
to
make
up
my
mind
--
in
complete
solitude
;
and
,
*NL*
since
I
of
course
absolutely
owe
you
the
information
,
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
going
out
with
it
quite
made
up
.
Have
therefore
a
little
more
*NL*
patience
with
me
.
Remember
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
``
that
that
's
what
you
*NL*
originally
asked
ME
to
have
.
I
've
had
it

you
see
what
*NL*
has
come
of
it

on
with

*NL*
*NL*
Chad
looked
grave
.
``
How
much
longer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
till
I
make
you
a
sign

n't
myself

at
the
best

*NL*
or
at
the
worst

for
ever

Let
the
Pococks
come

''
Strether
*NL*
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
gains
you
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
it
gains
me
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
,
as
if
it
still
puzzled
him
,
waited
a
minute
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
get
back
to
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
yet
.
I
'm
not
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
,
''
Chad
asked
in
a
tone
of
his
own
,
``
the
charm
of
life
over
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immensely
.
''
Strether
faced
it
.
``
You
've
helped
me
so
to
feel
it
that
*NL*
that
surely
need
n't
surprise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
does
n't
surprise
me
,
and
I
'm
delighted
.
But
what
,
my
dear
*NL*
man
,
''
Chad
went
on
with
conscious
queerness
,
``
does
it
all
lead
to
for
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
of
position
and
of
relation
,
for
each
,
was
so
oddly
betrayed
*NL*
in
the
question
that
Chad
laughed
out
as
soon
as
he
had
uttered
*NL*
it
--
which
made
Strether
also
laugh
.
``
Well
,
to
my
having
a
certitude
*NL*
that
has
been
tested
--
that
has
passed
through
the
fire
.
But
oh
,
''
he
*NL*
could
n't
help
breaking
out
,
``
if
within
my
first
month
here
you
had
been
*NL*
willing
to
move
with
me
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Chad
,
while
he
broke
down
as
for
weight
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
should
have
been
over
there
by
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
you
would
n't
have
had
your
fun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
had
a
month
of
it
;
and
I
'm
having
now
,
if
you
want
to
*NL*
know
,
''
Strether
continued
,
``
enough
to
last
me
for
the
rest
of
my
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
looked
amused
and
interested
,
yet
still
somewhat
in
the
dark
;
*NL*
partly
perhaps
because
Strether
's
estimate
of
fun
had
required
of
him
*NL*
from
the
first
a
good
deal
of
elucidation
.
``
It
would
n't
do
if
I
left
*NL*
you
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
me
?
''
--
Strether
remained
blank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
a
month
or
two
--
time
to
go
and
come
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
''
*NL*
Chad
smiled
,
``
would
look
after
you
in
the
interval
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
go
back
by
yourself
,
I
remaining
here
?
''
Again
for
an
instant
their
*NL*
eyes
had
the
question
out
;
after
which
Strether
said
:
``
Grotesque
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
to
see
Mother
,
''
Chad
presently
returned
.
``
Remember
how
*NL*
long
it
is
since
I
've
seen
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
indeed
;
and
that
's
exactly
why
I
was
originally
so
keen
for
*NL*
moving
you
.
Had
n't
you
shown
us
enough
how
beautifully
you
could
do
*NL*
without
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
,
''
said
Chad
wonderfully
,
``
I
'm
better
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
easy
triumph
in
it
that
made
his
friend
laugh
out
again
.
*NL*
``
Oh
if
you
were
worse
I
SHOULD
know
what
to
do
with
you
.
In
that
case
*NL*
I
believe
I
'd
have
you
gagged
and
strapped
down
,
carried
on
board
*NL*
resisting
,
kicking
.
How
MUCH
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
do
you
want
to
see
*NL*
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
--
Chad
seemed
to
find
it
in
fact
difficult
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
as
much
as
you
've
made
me
.
I
'd
give
anything
to
see
her
.
And
*NL*
you
've
left
me
,
''
Chad
went
on
,
``
in
little
enough
doubt
as
to
how
much
*NL*
SHE
wants
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
a
minute
.
``
Well
then
if
those
things
are
really
your
*NL*
motive
catch
the
French
steamer
and
sail
to-morrow
.
Of
course
,
when
it
*NL*
comes
to
that
,
you
're
absolutely
free
to
do
as
you
choose
.
From
the
*NL*
moment
you
ca
n't
hold
yourself
I
can
only
accept
your
flight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
fly
in
a
minute
then
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
if
you
'll
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
here
till
the
next
steamer
--
then
I
'll
follow
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
call
that
,
''
Chad
asked
,
``
accepting
my
flight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
--
it
's
the
only
thing
to
call
it
.
The
only
way
to
keep
me
*NL*
here
,
accordingly
,
''
Strether
explained
,
``
is
by
staying
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
took
it
in
.
``
All
the
more
that
I
've
really
dished
you
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dished
me
?
''
Strether
echoed
as
inexpressively
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
if
she
sends
out
the
Pococks
it
will
be
that
she
does
n't
trust
*NL*
you
,
and
if
she
does
n't
trust
you
,
that
bears
upon
--
well
,
you
know
*NL*
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
decided
after
a
moment
that
he
did
know
what
,
and
in
*NL*
consonance
with
this
he
spoke
.
``
You
see
then
all
the
more
what
you
owe
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
do
see
,
how
can
I
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
not
deserting
me
.
By
standing
by
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
say
--
!
''
But
Chad
,
as
they
went
downstairs
,
clapped
a
firm
hand
,
*NL*
in
the
manner
of
a
pledge
,
upon
his
shoulder
.
They
descended
slowly
*NL*
together
and
had
,
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
,
some
further
talk
,
of
*NL*
which
the
upshot
was
that
they
presently
separated
.
Chad
Newsome
*NL*
departed
,
and
Strether
,
left
alone
,
looked
about
,
superficially
,
for
*NL*
Waymarsh
.
But
Waymarsh
had
n't
yet
,
it
appeared
,
come
down
,
and
our
*NL*
friend
finally
went
forth
without
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
that
afternoon
he
had
still
not
seen
him
,
but
he
was
*NL*
then
,
as
to
make
up
for
this
,
engaged
in
talk
about
him
with
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
.
Strether
had
kept
away
from
home
all
day
,
given
himself
up
to
*NL*
the
town
and
to
his
thoughts
,
wandered
and
mused
,
been
at
once
restless
*NL*
and
absorbed
--
and
all
with
the
present
climax
of
a
rich
little
welcome
*NL*
in
the
Quartier
Marboeuf
.
``
Waymarsh
has
been
,
`
unbeknown
'
to
me
,
I
'm
*NL*
convinced
''
--
for
Miss
Gostrey
had
enquired
--
``
in
communication
with
*NL*
Woollett
:
the
consequence
of
which
was
,
last
night
,
the
loudest
*NL*
possible
call
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
a
letter
to
bring
you
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
a
cable
,
which
I
have
at
this
moment
in
my
pocket
:
a
`
Come
back
by
*NL*
the
first
ship
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
hostess
,
it
might
have
been
made
out
,
just
escaped
changing
*NL*
colour
.
Reflexion
arrived
but
in
time
and
established
a
provisional
*NL*
serenity
.
It
was
perhaps
exactly
this
that
enabled
her
to
say
with
*NL*
duplicity
:
``
And
you
're
going
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
almost
deserve
it
when
you
abandon
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
as
if
this
were
not
worth
taking
up
.
``
My
absence
*NL*
has
helped
you
--
as
I
've
only
to
look
at
you
to
see
.
It
was
my
*NL*
calculation
,
and
I
'm
justified
.
You
're
not
where
you
were
.
And
the
*NL*
thing
,
''
she
smiled
,
``
was
for
me
not
to
be
there
either
.
You
can
go
of
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
I
feel
to-day
,
''
he
comfortably
declared
,
``
that
I
shall
want
you
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
him
all
in
again
.
``
Well
,
I
promise
you
not
again
to
leave
*NL*
you
,
but
it
will
only
be
to
follow
you
.
You
've
got
your
momentum
and
*NL*
can
toddle
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
intelligently
accepted
it
.
``
Yes
--
I
suppose
I
can
toddle
.
It
's
the
*NL*
sight
of
that
in
fact
that
has
upset
Waymarsh
.
He
can
bear
it
--
the
way
*NL*
I
strike
him
as
going
--
no
longer
.
That
's
only
the
climax
of
his
*NL*
original
feeling
.
He
wants
me
to
quit
;
and
he
must
have
written
to
*NL*
Woollett
that
I
'm
in
peril
of
perdition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
good
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
But
is
it
only
your
supposition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
make
it
out
--
it
explains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
denies
?
--
or
you
have
n't
asked
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
had
time
,
''
Strether
said
;
``
I
made
it
out
but
last
night
,
*NL*
putting
various
things
together
,
and
I
've
not
been
since
then
face
to
*NL*
face
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
Because
you
're
too
disgusted
?
You
ca
n't
trust
*NL*
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
settled
his
glasses
on
his
nose
.
``
Do
I
look
in
a
great
rage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
divine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
to
be
angry
about
.
He
has
done
me
on
*NL*
the
contrary
a
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
it
out
.
``
By
bringing
things
to
a
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
you
understand
!
''
he
almost
groaned
.
``
Waymarsh
wo
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
,
at
any
rate
,
when
I
have
it
out
with
him

deny
or
extenuate
.
He
*NL*
has
acted
from
the
deepest
conviction
,
with
the
best
conscience
and
*NL*
after
wakeful
nights
.
He
'll
recognise
that
he
's
fully
responsible
,
and
*NL*
will
consider
that
he
has
been
highly
successful
;
so
that
any
*NL*
discussion
we
may
have
will
bring
us
quite
together
again

bridge
the
*NL*
dark
stream
that
has
kept
us
so
thoroughly
apart

We
shall
have
at

last
,
in
the
consequences

his
act
,
something
we
can
definitely
talk
*NL*
about

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
a
little
.
``
How
wonderfully
you
take
it
!
But
you
're
*NL*
always
wonderful

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
pause
that
matched
her
own
;
then
he
had
,
with
an
adequate
*NL*
spirit
,
a
complete
admission
.
``
It
's
quite
true

I
'm
extremely
*NL*
wonderful
just
now

I
dare
say
in
fact
I

quite
fantastic

me
!
''
she
earnestly
pressed
.
As
he
,
however
,
for
the
time
*NL*
answered
nothing
,
only
returning
the
look
with
which
she
watched
him
,
*NL*
she
presented
herself
where
it
was
easier
to
meet
her
.
``
What
will
Mr.
*NL*
Waymarsh
exactly
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
have
written
a
letter
.
One
will
have
been
quite
enough
.
He
*NL*
has
told
them
I
want
looking
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
DO
you
?
''
--
she
was
all
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immensely
.
And
I
shall
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
which
you
mean
you
do
n't
budge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
budge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
cabled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
've
made
Chad
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
decline
to
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
HE
declines
.
We
had
it
out
this
morning
and
I
brought
him
round
.
*NL*
He
had
come
in
,
before
I
was
down
,
to
tell
me
he
was
ready
--
ready
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
to
return
.
And
he
went
off
,
after
ten
minutes
with
me
,
to
say
he
*NL*
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
followed
with
intensity
.
``
Then
you
've
STOPPED
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
settled
himself
afresh
in
his
chair
.
``
I
've
stopped
him
.
That
*NL*
is
for
the
time
.
That
''
--
he
gave
it
to
her
more
vividly
--
``
is
where
I
*NL*
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
.
But
where
's
Mr.
Newsome
?
He
was
ready
,
''
she
asked
,
``
to
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
sincerely
--
believing
YOU
'D
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
,
I
think
;
so
that
he
was
amazed
to
find
the
hand
I
had
laid
*NL*
on
him
to
pull
him
over
suddenly
converted
into
an
engine
for
keeping
*NL*
him
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
account
of
the
matter
Miss
Gostrey
could
weigh
.
``
Does
he
*NL*
think
the
conversion
sudden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
I
'm
not
altogether
sure
what
he
thinks
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
sure
of
anything
that
concerns
him
,
except
that
the
more
I
've
seen
*NL*
of
him
the
less
I
've
found
him
what
I
originally
expected
.
He
's
*NL*
obscure
,
and
that
's
why
I
'm
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
But
for
what
in
particular
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
answer
to
his
cable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
his
cable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
Strether
replied
;
``
it
was
to
be
,
when
he
left
me
,
*NL*
according
to
his
own
taste
.
I
simply
said
to
him
:
'
I
want
to
stay
,
and
*NL*
the
only
way
for
me
to
do
so
is
for
you
to
.
'
That
I
wanted
to
stay
*NL*
seemed
to
interest
him
,
and
he
acted
on
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
turned
it
over
.
``
He
wants
then
himself
to
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
half
wants
it
.
That
is
he
half
wants
to
go
.
My
original
appeal
*NL*
has
to
that
extent
worked
in
him
.
Nevertheless
,
''
Strether
pursued
,
``
he
*NL*
wo
n't
go
.
Not
,
at
least
,
so
long
as
I
'm
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
,
''
his
companion
suggested
,
``
stay
here
always
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
no
means
.
Still
,
I
want
to
see
him
a
little
further
.
He
's
not
in
*NL*
the
least
the
case
I
supposed
,
he
's
quite
another
case
.
And
it
's
as
*NL*
such
that
he
interests
me
.
''
It
was
almost
as
if
for
his
own
*NL*
intelligence
that
,
deliberate
and
lucid
,
our
friend
thus
expressed
the
*NL*
matter
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
give
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
but
desired
to
help
his
lucidity
.
She
had
however
to
be
*NL*
light
and
tactful
.
``
Up
,
you
mean
--
a
--
to
his
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
thinking
of
his
mother
now
.
I
'm
thinking
of
the
plan
of
*NL*
which
I
was
the
mouthpiece
,
which
,
as
soon
as
we
met
,
I
put
before
him
*NL*
as
persuasively
as
I
knew
how
,
and
which
was
drawn
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
complete
ignorance
of
all
that
,
in
this
last
long
period
,
has
been
*NL*
happening
to
him
.
It
took
no
account
whatever
of
the
impression
I
was
*NL*
here
on
the
spot
immediately
to
begin
to
receive
from
him
--
impressions
*NL*
of
which
I
feel
sure
I
'm
far
from
having
had
the
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
had
a
smile
of
the
most
genial
criticism
.
``
So
your
idea
*NL*
is
--
more
or
less
--
to
stay
out
of
curiosity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
it
what
you
like
!
I
do
n't
care
what
it
's
called
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
you
do
stay
?
Certainly
not
then
.
I
call
it
,
all
the
same
,
*NL*
immense
fun
,
''
Maria
Gostrey
declared
;
``
and
to
see
you
work
it
out
will
*NL*
be
one
of
the
sensations
of
my
life
.
It
IS
clear
you
can
toddle
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
this
tribute
without
elation
.
``
I
sha
n't
be
alone
when
the
*NL*
Pococks
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyebrows
went
up
.
``
The
Pococks
are
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
I
mean
,
is
what
will
happen
--
and
happen
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
--
in
consequence
of
Chad
's
cable
.
They
'll
simply
embark
.
Sarah
*NL*
will
come
to
speak
for
her
mother
--
with
an
effect
different
from
MY
*NL*
muddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
more
gravely
wondered
.
``
SHE
then
will
take
him
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
--
and
we
shall
see
.
She
must
at
any
rate
have
the
*NL*
chance
,
and
she
may
be
trusted
to
do
all
she
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
WANT
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
I
want
it
.
I
want
to
play
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
lost
for
a
moment
the
thread
.
``
If
it
devolves
on
the
*NL*
Pococks
why
do
you
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
to
see
that
I
DO
play
fair
--
and
a
little
also
,
no
doubt
,
that
*NL*
they
do
.
''
Strether
was
luminous
as
he
had
never
been
.
``
I
came
out
to
*NL*
find
myself
in
presence
of
new
facts
--
facts
that
have
kept
striking
me
*NL*
as
less
and
less
met
by
our
old
reasons
.
The
matter
's
perfectly
*NL*
simple
.
New
reasons
--
reasons
as
new
as
the
facts
themselves
--
are
*NL*
wanted
;
and
of
this
our
friends
at
Woollett
--
Chad
's
and
mine
--
were
at
*NL*
the
earliest
moment
definitely
notified
.
If
any
are
producible
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
will
produce
them
;
she
'll
bring
over
the
whole
collection
.
*NL*
They
'll
be
,
''
he
added
with
a
pensive
smile
``
a
part
of
the
`
fun
'
you
*NL*
speak
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quite
in
the
current
now
and
floating
by
his
side
.
``
It
's
*NL*
Mamie
--
so
far
as
I
've
had
it
from
you
--
who
'll
be
their
great
card
.
''
And
*NL*
then
as
his
contemplative
silence
was
n't
a
denial
she
significantly
*NL*
added
:
``
I
think
I
'm
sorry
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
!
''
--
and
Strether
sprang
up
,
moving
about
a
little
as
her
*NL*
eyes
followed
him
.
``
But
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
her
coming
out
ca
n't
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
explained
after
another
turn
what
he
meant
.
``
The
only
way
for
her
*NL*
not
to
come
is
for
me
to
go
home
--
as
I
believe
that
on
the
spot
I
could
*NL*
prevent
it
.
But
the
difficulty
as
to
that
is
that
if
I
do
go
home
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
''
--
she
had
easily
understood
.
``
Mr.
Newsome
will
do
the
*NL*
same
,
and
that
's
not
''
--
she
laughed
out
now
--
``
to
be
thought
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
no
laugh
;
he
had
only
a
quiet
comparatively
placid
look
*NL*
that
might
have
shown
him
as
proof
against
ridicule
.
``
Strange
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
,
in
the
matter
that
so
much
interested
them
,
come
so
far
as
*NL*
this
without
sounding
another
name
--
to
which
however
their
present
*NL*
momentary
silence
was
full
of
a
conscious
reference
.
Strether
's
*NL*
question
was
a
sufficient
implication
of
the
weight
it
had
gained
with
*NL*
him
during
the
absence
of
his
hostess
;
and
just
for
that
reason
a
*NL*
single
gesture
from
her
could
pass
for
him
as
a
vivid
answer
.
Yet
he
*NL*
was
answered
still
better
when
she
said
in
a
moment
:
``
Will
Mr.
Newsome
*NL*
introduce
his
sister
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Madame
de
Vionnet
?
''
Strether
spoke
the
name
at
last
.
``
I
shall
be
*NL*
greatly
surprised
if
he
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
gaze
at
the
possibility
.
``
You
mean
you
've
thought
of
it
*NL*
and
you
're
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
of
it
and
I
'm
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
her
visitor
now
that
she
applied
her
consideration
.
``
Bon
!
*NL*
You
ARE
magnificent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
answered
after
a
pause
and
a
little
wearily
,
but
still
*NL*
standing
there
before
her
--
``
well
,
that
's
what
,
just
once
in
all
my
dull
*NL*
days
,
I
think
I
shall
like
to
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
he
had
news
from
Chad
of
a
communication
from
Woollett
*NL*
in
response
to
their
determinant
telegram
,
this
missive
being
addressed
*NL*
to
Chad
himself
and
announcing
the
immediate
departure
for
France
of
*NL*
Sarah
and
Jim
and
Mamie
.
Strether
had
meanwhile
on
his
own
side
*NL*
cabled
;
he
had
but
delayed
that
act
till
after
his
visit
to
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
,
an
interview
by
which
,
as
so
often
before
,
he
felt
his
sense
*NL*
of
things
cleared
up
and
settled
.
His
message
to
Mrs.
Newsome
,
in
*NL*
answer
to
her
own
,
had
consisted
of
the
words
:
``
Judge
best
to
take
*NL*
another
month
,
but
with
full
appreciation
of
all
re-enforcements
.
''
He
*NL*
had
added
that
he
was
writing
,
but
he
was
of
course
always
writing
;
it
*NL*
was
a
practice
that
continued
,
oddly
enough
,
to
relieve
him
,
to
make
*NL*
him
come
nearer
than
anything
else
to
the
consciousness
of
doing
*NL*
something
:
so
that
he
often
wondered
if
he
had
n't
really
,
under
his
*NL*
recent
stress
,
acquired
some
hollow
trick
,
one
of
the
specious
arts
of
*NL*
make-believe
.
Would
n't
the
pages
he
still
so
freely
dispatched
by
the
*NL*
American
post
have
been
worthy
of
a
showy
journalist
,
some
master
of
*NL*
the
great
new
science
of
beating
the
sense
out
of
words
?
Was
n't
he
*NL*
writing
against
time
,
and
mainly
to
show
he
was
kind
?
--
since
it
had
*NL*
become
quite
his
habit
not
to
like
to
read
himself
over
.
On
those
*NL*
lines
he
could
still
be
liberal
,
yet
it
was
at
best
a
sort
of
whistling
*NL*
in
the
dark
.
It
was
unmistakeable
moreover
that
the
sense
of
being
in
*NL*
the
dark
now
pressed
on
him
more
sharply
--
creating
thereby
the
need
for
*NL*
a
louder
and
livelier
whistle
.
He
whistled
long
and
hard
after
sending
*NL*
his
message
;
he
whistled
again
and
again
in
celebration
of
Chad
's
news
;
*NL*
there
was
an
interval
of
a
fortnight
in
which
this
exercise
helped
him
.
*NL*
He
had
no
great
notion
of
what
,
on
the
spot
,
Sarah
Pocock
would
have
to
*NL*
say
,
though
he
had
indeed
confused
premonitions
;
but
it
should
n't
be
in
*NL*
her
power
to
say
--
it
should
n't
be
in
any
one
's
anywhere
to
say
--
that
he
*NL*
was
neglecting
her
mother
.
He
might
have
written
before
more
freely
,
*NL*
but
he
had
never
written
more
copiously
;
and
he
frankly
gave
for
a
*NL*
reason
at
Woollett
that
he
wished
to
fill
the
void
created
there
by
*NL*
Sarah
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
increase
of
his
darkness
,
however
,
and
the
quickening
,
as
I
have
*NL*
called
it
,
of
his
tune
,
resided
in
the
fact
that
he
was
hearing
almost
*NL*
nothing
.
He
had
for
some
time
been
aware
that
he
was
hearing
less
than
*NL*
before
,
and
he
was
now
clearly
following
a
process
by
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
's
letters
could
but
logically
stop
.
He
had
n't
had
a
line
for
*NL*
many
days
,
and
he
needed
no
proof
--
though
he
was
,
in
time
,
to
have
*NL*
plenty
--
that
she
would
n't
have
put
pen
to
paper
after
receiving
the
*NL*
hint
that
had
determined
her
telegram
.
She
would
n't
write
till
Sarah
*NL*
should
have
seen
him
and
reported
on
him
.
It
was
strange
,
though
it
*NL*
might
well
be
less
so
than
his
own
behaviour
appeared
at
Woollett
.
It
*NL*
was
at
any
rate
significant
,
and
what
WAS
remarkable
was
the
way
his
*NL*
friend
's
nature
and
manner
put
on
for
him
,
through
this
very
drop
of
*NL*
demonstration
,
a
greater
intensity
.
It
struck
him
really
that
he
had
*NL*
never
so
lived
with
her
as
during
this
period
of
her
silence
;
the
*NL*
silence
was
a
sacred
hush
,
a
finer
clearer
medium
,
in
which
her
*NL*
idiosyncrasies
showed
.
He
walked
about
with
her
,
sat
with
her
,
drove
*NL*
with
her
and
dined
face-to-face
with
her
--
a
rare
treat
``
in
his
life
,
''
*NL*
as
he
could
perhaps
have
scarce
escaped
phrasing
it
;
and
if
he
had
*NL*
never
seen
her
so
soundless
he
had
never
,
on
the
other
hand
,
felt
her
*NL*
so
highly
,
so
almost
austerely
,
herself
:
pure
and
by
the
vulgar
*NL*
estimate
``
cold
,
''
but
deep
devoted
delicate
sensitive
noble
.
Her
*NL*
vividness
in
these
respects
became
for
him
,
in
the
special
conditions
,
*NL*
almost
an
obsession
;
and
though
the
obsession
sharpened
his
pulses
,
*NL*
adding
really
to
the
excitement
of
life
,
there
were
hours
at
which
,
to
*NL*
be
less
on
the
stretch
,
he
directly
sought
forgetfulness
.
He
knew
it
*NL*
for
the
queerest
of
adventures
--
a
circumstance
capable
of
playing
such
*NL*
a
part
only
for
Lambert
Strether
--
that
in
Paris
itself
,
of
all
places
,
*NL*
he
should
find
this
ghost
of
the
lady
of
Woollett
more
importunate
than
*NL*
any
other
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
back
to
Maria
Gostrey
it
was
for
the
change
to
something
*NL*
else
.
And
yet
after
all
the
change
scarcely
operated
for
he
talked
to
*NL*
her
of
Mrs.
Newsome
in
these
days
as
he
had
never
talked
before
.
He
*NL*
had
hitherto
observed
in
that
particular
a
discretion
and
a
law
;
*NL*
considerations
that
at
present
broke
down
quite
as
if
relations
had
*NL*
altered
.
They
had
n't
REALLY
altered
,
he
said
to
himself
,
so
much
as
*NL*
that
came
to
;
for
if
what
had
occurred
was
of
course
that
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
had
ceased
to
trust
him
,
there
was
nothing
on
the
other
hand
to
prove
*NL*
that
he
should
n't
win
back
her
confidence
.
It
was
quite
his
present
*NL*
theory
that
he
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
do
so
;
and
in
fact
if
*NL*
he
now
told
Maria
things
about
her
that
he
had
never
told
before
this
*NL*
was
largely
because
it
kept
before
him
the
idea
of
the
honour
of
such
a
*NL*
woman
's
esteem
.
His
relation
with
Maria
as
well
was
,
strangely
enough
,
*NL*
no
longer
quite
the
same
;
this
truth
--
though
not
too
*NL*
disconcertingly
--
had
come
up
between
them
on
the
renewal
of
their
*NL*
meetings
.
It
was
all
contained
in
what
she
had
then
almost
immediately
*NL*
said
to
him
;
it
was
represented
by
the
remark
she
had
needed
but
ten
*NL*
minutes
to
make
and
that
he
had
n't
been
disposed
to
gainsay
.
He
could
*NL*
toddle
alone
,
and
the
difference
that
showed
was
extraordinary
.
The
*NL*
turn
taken
by
their
talk
had
promptly
confirmed
this
difference
;
his
*NL*
larger
confidence
on
the
score
of
Mrs.
Newsome
did
the
rest
;
and
the
*NL*
time
seemed
already
far
off
when
he
had
held
out
his
small
thirsty
cup
*NL*
to
the
spout
of
her
pail
.
Her
pail
was
scarce
touched
now
,
and
other
*NL*
fountains
had
flowed
for
him
;
she
fell
into
her
place
as
but
one
of
his
*NL*
tributaries
;
and
there
was
a
strange
sweetness
--
a
melancholy
mildness
*NL*
that
touched
him
--
in
her
acceptance
of
the
altered
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
marked
for
himself
the
flight
of
time
,
or
at
any
rate
what
he
was
*NL*
pleased
to
think
of
with
irony
and
pity
as
the
rush
of
experience
;
it
*NL*
having
been
but
the
day
before
yesterday
that
he
sat
at
her
feet
and
*NL*
held
on
by
her
garment
and
was
fed
by
her
hand
.
It
was
the
proportions
*NL*
that
were
changed
,
and
the
proportions
were
at
all
times
,
he
*NL*
philosophised
,
the
very
conditions
of
perception
,
the
terms
of
thought
.
*NL*
It
was
as
if
,
with
her
effective
little
entresol
and
and
her
wide
*NL*
acquaintance
,
her
activities
,
varieties
,
promiscuities
,
the
duties
and
*NL*
devotions
that
took
up
nine
tenths
of
her
time
and
of
which
he
got
,
*NL*
guardedly
,
but
the
side-wind
--
it
was
as
if
she
had
shrunk
to
a
*NL*
secondary
element
and
had
consented
to
the
shrinkage
with
the
*NL*
perfection
of
tact
.
This
perfection
had
never
failed
her
;
it
had
*NL*
originally
been
greater
than
his
prime
measure
for
it
;
it
had
kept
him
*NL*
quite
apart
,
kept
him
out
of
the
shop
,
as
she
called
her
huge
general
*NL*
acquaintance
,
made
their
commerce
as
quiet
,
as
much
a
thing
of
the
home
*NL*
alone
--
the
opposite
of
the
shop
--
as
if
she
had
never
another
customer
.
*NL*
She
had
been
wonderful
to
him
at
first
,
with
the
memory
of
her
little
*NL*
entresol
,
the
image
to
which
,
on
most
mornings
at
that
time
,
his
eyes
*NL*
directly
opened
;
but
now
she
mainly
figured
for
him
as
but
part
of
the
*NL*
bristling
total
--
though
of
course
always
as
a
person
to
whom
he
should
*NL*
never
cease
to
be
indebted
.
It
would
never
be
given
to
him
certainly
*NL*
to
inspire
a
greater
kindness
.
She
had
decked
him
out
for
others
,
and
*NL*
he
saw
at
this
point
at
least
nothing
she
would
ever
ask
for
.
She
only
*NL*
wondered
and
questioned
and
listened
,
rendering
him
the
homage
of
a
*NL*
wistful
speculation
.
She
expressed
it
repeatedly
;
he
was
already
far
*NL*
beyond
her
,
and
she
must
prepare
herself
to
lose
him
.
There
was
but
*NL*
one
little
chance
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
as
she
had
said
it
he
met
it
--
for
it
was
a
touch
he
liked
--
each
*NL*
time
the
same
way
.
``
My
coming
to
grief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
then
I
might
patch
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
for
my
real
smash
,
if
it
takes
place
,
there
will
be
no
patching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
surely
do
n't
mean
it
will
kill
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
worse
.
It
will
make
me
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
nothing
can
do
that
!
The
wonderful
and
special
thing
about
you
is
*NL*
that
you
ARE
,
at
this
time
of
day
,
youth
.
''
Then
she
always
made
,
*NL*
further
,
one
of
those
remarks
that
she
had
completely
ceased
to
adorn
*NL*
with
hesitations
or
apologies
,
and
that
had
,
by
the
same
token
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
their
extreme
straightness
,
ceased
to
produce
in
Strether
the
*NL*
least
embarrassment
.
She
made
him
believe
them
,
and
they
became
*NL*
thereby
as
impersonal
as
truth
itself
.
``
It
's
just
your
particular
*NL*
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
answer
too
was
always
the
same
.
``
Of
course
I
'm
youth
--
youth
for
*NL*
the
trip
to
Europe
.
I
began
to
be
young
,
or
at
least
to
get
the
*NL*
benefit
of
it
,
the
moment
I
met
you
at
Chester
,
and
that
's
what
has
*NL*
been
taking
place
ever
since
.
I
never
had
the
benefit
at
the
proper
*NL*
time
--
which
comes
to
saying
that
I
never
had
the
thing
itself
.
I
'm
*NL*
having
the
benefit
at
this
moment
;
I
had
it
the
other
day
when
I
said
*NL*
to
Chad
`
Wait
'
;
I
shall
have
it
still
again
when
Sarah
Pocock
arrives
.
*NL*
It
's
a
benefit
that
would
make
a
poor
show
for
many
people
;
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
who
else
but
you
and
I
,
frankly
,
could
begin
to
see
in
it
what
I
*NL*
feel
.
I
do
n't
get
drunk
;
I
do
n't
pursue
the
ladies
;
I
do
n't
spend
*NL*
money
;
I
do
n't
even
write
sonnets
.
But
nevertheless
I
'm
making
up
late
*NL*
for
what
I
did
n't
have
early
.
I
cultivate
my
little
benefit
in
my
own
*NL*
little
way
.
It
amuses
me
more
than
anything
that
has
happened
to
me
in
*NL*
all
my
life
.
They
may
say
what
they
like
--
it
's
my
surrender
,
it
's
my
*NL*
tribute
,
to
youth
.
One
puts
that
in
where
one
can
--
it
has
to
come
in
*NL*
somewhere
,
if
only
out
of
the
lives
,
the
conditions
,
the
feelings
of
*NL*
other
persons
.
Chad
gives
me
the
sense
of
it
,
for
all
his
grey
hairs
,
*NL*
which
merely
make
it
solid
in
him
and
safe
and
serene
;
and
SHE
does
the
*NL*
same
,
for
all
her
being
older
than
he
,
for
all
her
marriageable
*NL*
daughter
,
her
separated
husband
,
her
agitated
history
.
Though
they
're
*NL*
young
enough
,
my
pair
,
I
do
n't
say
they
're
,
in
the
freshest
way
,
their
*NL*
own
absolutely
prime
adolescence
;
for
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
The
point
is
that
they
're
mine
.
Yes
,
they
're
my
youth
;
since
somehow
*NL*
at
the
right
time
nothing
else
ever
was
.
What
I
meant
just
now
*NL*
therefore
is
that
it
would
all
go
--
go
before
doing
its
work
--
if
they
*NL*
were
to
fail
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
,
just
here
,
Miss
Gostrey
inveterately
questioned
.
``
What
do
*NL*
you
,
in
particular
,
call
its
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
see
me
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
through
what
?
''
--
she
liked
to
get
it
all
out
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
through
this
experience
.
''
That
was
all
that
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
regularly
gave
her
none
the
less
the
last
word
.
``
Do
n't
you
remember
*NL*
how
in
those
first
days
of
our
meeting
it
was
I
who
was
to
see
you
*NL*
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
?
Tenderly
,
deeply
''
--
he
always
rose
to
it
.
``
You
're
just
*NL*
doing
your
part
in
letting
me
maunder
to
you
thus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
do
n't
speak
as
if
my
part
were
small
;
since
whatever
else
fails
*NL*
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU
wo
n't
,
ever
,
ever
,
ever
?
''
--
he
thus
took
her
up
.
``
Oh
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
;
you
necessarily
,
you
inevitably
WILL
.
Your
conditions

that

*NL*
what
I
mean

wo
n't
allow
me
anything
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
alone
--
I
see
what
you
mean

that
I
'm
drearily
dreadfully
old

I
*NL*
AM

but
there
's
a
service
--
possible
for
you
to
render

that
I
know

all
*NL*
the
same
,
I
shall
think
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
in
fine
,
however
,
she
would
never
tell
him
.
``
You
shall
hear
only
*NL*
if
your
smash
takes
place
.
As
that
's
really
out
of
the
question
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
expose
myself
''
--
a
point
at
which
,
for
reasons
of
his
own
,
*NL*
Strether
ceased
to
press
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
round
,
for
publicity
--
it
was
the
easiest
thing
--
to
the
idea
*NL*
that
his
smash
WAS
out
of
the
question
,
and
this
rendered
idle
the
*NL*
discussion
of
what
might
follow
it
.
He
attached
an
added
importance
,
*NL*
as
the
days
elapsed
,
to
the
arrival
of
the
Pococks
;
he
had
even
a
*NL*
shameful
sense
of
waiting
for
it
insincerely
and
incorrectly
.
He
*NL*
accused
himself
of
making
believe
to
his
own
mind
that
Sarah
's
*NL*
presence
,
her
impression
,
her
judgement
would
simplify
and
harmonise
,
*NL*
he
accused
himself
of
being
so
afraid
of
what
they
MIGHT
do
that
he
*NL*
sought
refuge
,
to
beg
the
whole
question
,
in
a
vain
fury
.
He
had
*NL*
abundantly
seen
at
home
what
they
were
in
the
habit
of
doing
,
and
he
*NL*
had
not
at
present
the
smallest
ground
.
His
clearest
vision
was
when
*NL*
he
made
out
that
what
he
most
desired
was
an
account
more
full
and
free
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Newsome
's
state
of
mind
than
any
he
felt
he
could
now
expect
*NL*
from
herself
;
that
calculation
at
least
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
*NL*
sharp
consciousness
of
wishing
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
was
not
*NL*
afraid
to
look
his
behaviour
in
the
face
.
If
he
was
by
an
inexorable
*NL*
logic
to
pay
for
it
he
was
literally
impatient
to
know
the
cost
,
and
he
*NL*
held
himself
ready
to
pay
in
instalments
.
The
first
instalment
would
*NL*
be
precisely
this
entertainment
of
Sarah
;
as
a
consequence
of
which
*NL*
moreover
,
he
should
know
vastly
better
how
he
stood
.

I

Strether
rambled
alone
during
these
few
days
,
the
effect
of
the
*NL*
incident
of
the
previous
week
having
been
to
simplify
in
a
marked
*NL*
fashion
his
mixed
relations
with
Waymarsh
.
Nothing
had
passed
between
*NL*
them
in
reference
to
Mrs.
Newsome
's
summons
but
that
our
friend
had
*NL*
mentioned
to
his
own
the
departure
of
the
deputation
actually
at
*NL*
sea
--
giving
him
thus
an
opportunity
to
confess
to
the
occult
*NL*
intervention
he
imputed
to
him
.
Waymarsh
however
in
the
event
*NL*
confessed
to
nothing
;
and
though
this
falsified
in
some
degree
*NL*
Strether
's
forecast
the
latter
amusedly
saw
in
it
the
same
depth
of
*NL*
good
conscience
out
of
which
the
dear
man
's
impertinence
had
originally
*NL*
sprung
.
He
was
patient
with
the
dear
man
now
and
delighted
to
observe
*NL*
how
unmistakeably
he
had
put
on
flesh
;
he
felt
his
own
holiday
so
*NL*
successfully
large
and
free
that
he
was
full
of
allowances
and
*NL*
charities
in
respect
to
those
cabined
and
confined
'
his
instinct
toward
*NL*
a
spirit
so
strapped
down
as
Waymarsh
's
was
to
walk
round
it
on
tiptoe
*NL*
for
fear
of
waking
it
up
to
a
sense
of
losses
by
this
time
*NL*
irretrievable
.
It
was
all
very
funny
he
knew
,
and
but
the
difference
,
*NL*
as
he
often
said
to
himself
,
of
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
--
an
*NL*
emancipation
so
purely
comparative
that
it
was
like
the
advance
of
the
*NL*
door-mat
on
the
scraper
;
yet
the
present
crisis
was
happily
to
profit
*NL*
by
it
and
the
pilgrim
from
Milrose
to
know
himself
more
than
ever
in
*NL*
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
felt
that
when
he
heard
of
the
approach
of
the
Pococks
the
*NL*
impulse
of
pity
quite
sprang
up
in
him
beside
the
impulse
of
triumph
.
*NL*
That
was
exactly
why
Waymarsh
had
looked
at
him
with
eyes
in
which
the
*NL*
heat
of
justice
was
measured
and
shaded
.
He
had
looked
very
hard
,
as
*NL*
if
affectionately
sorry
for
the
friend
--
the
friend
of
fifty-five
--
whose
*NL*
frivolity
had
had
thus
to
be
recorded
;
becoming
,
however
,
but
obscurely
*NL*
sententious
and
leaving
his
companion
to
formulate
a
charge
.
It
was
in
*NL*
this
general
attitude
that
he
had
of
late
altogether
taken
refuge
;
with
*NL*
the
drop
of
discussion
they
were
solemnly
sadly
superficial
;
Strether
*NL*
recognised
in
him
the
mere
portentous
rumination
to
which
Miss
Barrace
*NL*
had
so
good-humouredly
described
herself
as
assigning
a
corner
of
her
*NL*
salon
.
It
was
quite
as
if
he
knew
his
surreptitious
step
had
been
*NL*
divined
,
and
it
was
also
as
if
he
missed
the
chance
to
explain
the
*NL*
purity
of
his
motive
;
but
this
privation
of
relief
should
be
precisely
*NL*
his
small
penance
:
it
was
not
amiss
for
Strether
that
he
should
find
*NL*
himself
to
that
degree
uneasy
.
If
he
had
been
challenged
or
accused
,
*NL*
rebuked
for
meddling
or
otherwise
pulled
up
,
he
would
probably
have
*NL*
shown
,
on
his
own
system
,
all
the
height
of
his
consistency
,
all
the
*NL*
depth
of
his
good
faith
.
Explicit
resentment
of
his
course
would
have
*NL*
made
him
take
the
floor
,
and
the
thump
of
his
fist
on
the
table
would
*NL*
have
affirmed
him
as
consciously
incorruptible
.
Had
what
now
really
*NL*
prevailed
with
Strether
been
but
a
dread
of
that
thump
--
a
dread
of
*NL*
wincing
a
little
painfully
at
what
it
might
invidiously
demonstrate
?
*NL*
However
this
might
be
,
at
any
rate
,
one
of
the
marks
of
the
crisis
was
*NL*
a
visible
,
a
studied
lapse
,
in
Waymarsh
,
of
betrayed
concern
.
As
if
to
*NL*
make
up
to
his
comrade
for
the
stroke
by
which
he
had
played
providence
*NL*
he
now
conspicuously
ignored
his
movements
,
withdrew
himself
from
the
*NL*
pretension
to
share
them
,
stiffened
up
his
sensibility
to
neglect
,
and
,
*NL*
clasping
his
large
empty
hands
and
swinging
his
large
restless
foot
,
*NL*
clearly
looked
to
another
quarter
for
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
for
independence
on
Strether
's
part
,
and
he
had
in
truth
at
*NL*
no
moment
of
his
stay
been
so
free
to
go
and
come
.
The
early
summer
*NL*
brushed
the
picture
over
and
blurred
everything
but
the
near
;
it
made
a
*NL*
vast
warm
fragrant
medium
in
which
the
elements
floated
together
on
the
*NL*
best
of
terms
,
in
which
rewards
were
immediate
and
reckonings
*NL*
postponed
.
Chad
was
out
of
town
again
,
for
the
first
time
since
his
*NL*
visitor
's
first
view
of
him
;
he
had
explained
this
necessity
--
without
*NL*
detail
,
yet
also
without
embarrassment
,
the
circumstance
was
one
of
*NL*
those
which
,
in
the
young
man
's
life
,
testified
to
the
variety
of
his
*NL*
ties
.
Strether
was
n't
otherwise
concerned
with
it
than
for
its
so
*NL*
testifying
--
a
pleasant
multitudinous
image
in
which
he
took
comfort
.
He
*NL*
took
comfort
,
by
the
same
stroke
,
in
the
swing
of
Chad
's
pendulum
back
*NL*
from
that
other
swing
,
the
sharp
jerk
towards
Woollett
,
so
stayed
by
*NL*
his
own
hand
.
He
had
the
entertainment
of
thinking
that
if
he
had
for
*NL*
that
moment
stopped
the
clock
it
was
to
promote
the
next
minute
this
*NL*
still
livelier
motion
.
He
himself
did
what
he
had
n't
done
before
;
he
*NL*
took
two
or
three
times
whole
days
off
--
irrespective
of
others
,
of
two
*NL*
or
three
taken
with
Miss
Gostrey
,
two
or
three
taken
with
little
*NL*
Bilham
:
he
went
to
Chartres
and
cultivated
,
before
the
front
of
the
*NL*
cathedral
,
a
general
easy
beatitude
;
he
went
to
Fontainebleau
and
*NL*
imagined
himself
on
the
way
to
Italy
;
he
went
to
Rouen
with
a
little
*NL*
handbag
and
inordinately
spent
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
he
did
something
quite
different
;
finding
himself
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
a
fine
old
house
across
the
river
,
he
passed
under
the
*NL*
great
arch
of
its
doorway
and
asked
at
the
porter
's
lodge
for
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
.
He
had
already
hovered
more
than
once
about
that
possibility
,
*NL*
been
aware
of
it
,
in
the
course
of
ostensible
strolls
,
as
lurking
but
*NL*
round
the
corner
.
Only
it
had
perversely
happened
,
after
his
morning
*NL*
at
Notre
Dame
,
that
his
consistency
,
as
he
considered
and
intended
it
,
*NL*
had
come
back
to
him
;
whereby
he
had
reflected
that
the
encounter
in
*NL*
question
had
been
none
of
his
making
;
clinging
again
intensely
to
the
*NL*
strength
of
his
position
,
which
was
precisely
that
there
was
nothing
in
*NL*
it
for
himself
.
From
the
moment
he
actively
pursued
the
charming
*NL*
associate
of
his
adventure
,
from
that
moment
his
position
weakened
,
for
*NL*
he
was
then
acting
in
an
interested
way
.
It
was
only
within
a
few
days
*NL*
that
he
had
fixed
himself
a
limit
:
he
promised
himself
his
consistency
*NL*
should
end
with
Sarah
's
arrival
.
It
was
arguing
correctly
to
feel
the
*NL*
title
to
a
free
hand
conferred
on
him
by
this
event
.
If
he
was
n't
to
*NL*
be
let
alone
he
should
be
merely
a
dupe
to
act
with
delicacy
.
If
he
*NL*
was
n't
to
be
trusted
he
could
at
least
take
his
ease
.
If
he
was
to
be
*NL*
placed
under
control
he
gained
leave
to
try
what
his
position
MIGHT
*NL*
agreeably
give
him
.
An
ideal
rigour
would
perhaps
postpone
the
trial
*NL*
till
after
the
Pococks
had
shown
their
spirit
;
and
it
was
to
an
ideal
*NL*
rigour
that
he
had
quite
promised
himself
to
conform
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
however
,
on
this
particular
day
,
he
felt
a
particular
fear
*NL*
under
which
everything
collapsed
.
He
knew
abruptly
that
he
was
afraid
*NL*
of
himself
--
and
yet
not
in
relation
to
the
effect
on
his
sensibilities
*NL*
of
another
hour
of
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
What
he
dreaded
was
the
effect
*NL*
of
a
single
hour
of
Sarah
Pocock
,
as
to
whom
he
was
visited
,
in
*NL*
troubled
nights
,
with
fantastic
waking
dreams
.
She
loomed
at
him
*NL*
larger
than
life
;
she
increased
in
volume
as
she
drew
nearer
;
she
so
*NL*
met
his
eyes
that
,
his
imagination
taking
,
after
the
first
step
,
all
,
*NL*
and
more
than
all
,
the
strides
,
he
already
felt
her
come
down
on
him
,
*NL*
already
burned
,
under
her
reprobation
,
with
the
blush
of
guilt
,
already
*NL*
consented
,
by
way
of
penance
,
to
the
instant
forfeiture
of
everything
.
*NL*
He
saw
himself
,
under
her
direction
,
recommitted
to
Woollett
as
*NL*
juvenile
offenders
are
committed
to
reformatories
.
It
was
n't
of
course
*NL*
that
Woollett
was
really
a
place
of
discipline
;
but
he
knew
in
advance
*NL*
that
Sarah
's
salon
at
the
hotel
would
be
.
His
danger
,
at
any
rate
,
in
*NL*
such
moods
of
alarm
,
was
some
concession
,
on
this
ground
,
that
would
*NL*
involve
a
sharp
rupture
with
the
actual
;
therefore
if
he
waited
to
take
*NL*
leave
of
that
actual
he
might
wholly
miss
his
chance
.
It
was
*NL*
represented
with
supreme
vividness
by
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
and
that
is
*NL*
why
,
in
a
word
,
he
waited
no
longer
.
He
had
seen
in
a
flash
that
he
*NL*
must
anticipate
Mrs.
Pocock
.
He
was
accordingly
much
disappointed
on
*NL*
now
learning
from
the
portress
that
the
lady
of
his
quest
was
not
in
*NL*
Paris
.
She
had
gone
for
some
days
to
the
country
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
in
this
accident
but
what
was
natural
;
yet
it
produced
for
poor
*NL*
Strether
a
drop
of
all
confidence
.
It
was
suddenly
as
if
he
should
*NL*
never
see
her
again
,
and
as
if
moreover
he
had
brought
it
on
himself
by
*NL*
not
having
been
quite
kind
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
advantage
of
his
having
let
his
fancy
lose
itself
for
a
*NL*
little
in
the
gloom
that
,
as
by
reaction
,
the
prospect
began
really
to
*NL*
brighten
from
the
moment
the
deputation
from
Woollett
alighted
on
the
*NL*
platform
of
the
station
.
They
had
come
straight
from
Havre
,
having
*NL*
sailed
from
New
York
to
that
port
,
and
having
also
,
thanks
to
a
happy
*NL*
voyage
,
made
land
with
a
promptitude
that
left
Chad
Newsome
,
who
had
*NL*
meant
to
meet
them
at
the
dock
,
belated
.
He
had
received
their
*NL*
telegram
,
with
the
announcement
of
their
immediate
further
advance
,
*NL*
just
as
he
was
taking
the
train
for
Havre
,
so
that
nothing
had
remained
*NL*
for
him
but
to
await
them
in
Paris
.
He
hastily
picked
up
Strether
,
at
*NL*
the
hotel
,
for
this
purpose
,
and
he
even
,
with
easy
pleasantry
,
*NL*
suggested
the
attendance
of
Waymarsh
as
well
--
Waymarsh
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
his
cab
rattled
up
,
being
engaged
,
under
Strether
's
contemplative
*NL*
range
,
in
a
grave
perambulation
of
the
familiar
court
.
Waymarsh
had
*NL*
learned
from
his
companion
,
who
had
already
had
a
note
,
delivered
by
*NL*
hand
,
from
Chad
,
that
the
Pococks
were
due
,
and
had
ambiguously
,
*NL*
though
,
as
always
,
impressively
,
glowered
at
him
over
the
circumstance
;
*NL*
carrying
himself
in
a
manner
in
which
Strether
was
now
expert
enough
to
*NL*
recognise
his
uncertainty
,
in
the
premises
,
as
to
the
best
tone
.
The
*NL*
only
tone
he
aimed
at
with
confidence
was
a
full
tone
--
which
was
*NL*
necessarily
difficult
in
the
absence
of
a
full
knowledge
.
The
Pococks
*NL*
were
a
quantity
as
yet
unmeasured
,
and
,
as
he
had
practically
brought
*NL*
them
over
,
so
this
witness
had
to
that
extent
exposed
himself
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
feel
right
about
it
,
but
could
only
,
at
the
best
,
for
the
*NL*
time
,
feel
vague
.
``
I
shall
look
to
you
,
you
know
,
immensely
,
''
our
*NL*
friend
had
said
,
``
to
help
me
with
them
,
''
and
he
had
been
quite
*NL*
conscious
of
the
effect
of
the
remark
,
and
of
others
of
the
same
sort
,
*NL*
on
his
comrade
's
sombre
sensibility
.
He
had
insisted
on
the
fact
that
*NL*
Waymarsh
would
quite
like
Mrs.
Pocock
--
one
could
be
certain
he
would
:
*NL*
he
would
be
with
her
about
everything
,
and
she
would
also
be
with
HIM
,
*NL*
and
Miss
Barrace
's
nose
,
in
short
,
would
find
itself
out
of
joint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
woven
this
web
of
cheerfulness
while
they
waited
in
the
*NL*
court
for
Chad
;
he
had
sat
smoking
cigarettes
to
keep
himself
quiet
*NL*
while
,
caged
and
leonine
,
his
fellow
traveller
paced
and
turned
before
*NL*
him
.
Chad
Newsome
was
doubtless
to
be
struck
,
when
he
arrived
,
with
*NL*
the
sharpness
of
their
opposition
at
this
particular
hour
;
he
was
to
*NL*
remember
,
as
a
part
of
it
,
how
Waymarsh
came
with
him
and
with
Strether
*NL*
to
the
street
and
stood
there
with
a
face
half-wistful
and
half-rueful
.
*NL*
They
talked
of
him
,
the
two
others
,
as
they
drove
,
and
Strether
put
*NL*
Chad
in
possession
of
much
of
his
own
strained
sense
of
things
.
He
had
*NL*
already
,
a
few
days
before
,
named
to
him
the
wire
he
was
convinced
*NL*
their
friend
had
pulled
--
a
confidence
that
had
made
on
the
young
man
's
*NL*
part
quite
hugely
for
curiosity
and
diversion
.
The
action
of
the
*NL*
matter
,
moreover
,
Strether
could
see
,
was
to
penetrate
;
he
saw
that
is
,
*NL*
how
Chad
judged
a
system
of
influence
in
which
Waymarsh
had
served
as
a
*NL*
determinant
--
an
impression
just
now
quickened
again
;
with
the
whole
*NL*
bearing
of
such
a
fact
on
the
youth
's
view
of
his
relatives
.
As
it
*NL*
came
up
between
them
that
they
might
now
take
their
friend
for
a
*NL*
feature
of
the
control
of
these
latter
now
sought
to
be
exerted
from
*NL*
Woollett
,
Strether
felt
indeed
how
it
would
be
stamped
all
over
him
,
*NL*
half
an
hour
later
for
Sarah
Pocock
's
eyes
,
that
he
was
as
much
on
*NL*
Chad
's
``
side
''
as
Waymarsh
had
probably
described
him
.
He
was
letting
*NL*
himself
at
present
,
go
;
there
was
no
denying
it
;
it
might
be
*NL*
desperation
,
it
might
be
confidence
;
he
should
offer
himself
to
the
*NL*
arriving
travellers
bristling
with
all
the
lucidity
he
had
cultivated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
to
Chad
what
he
had
been
saying
in
the
court
to
Waymarsh
;
*NL*
how
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
his
sister
would
find
the
latter
a
*NL*
kindred
spirit
,
no
doubt
of
the
alliance
,
based
on
an
exchange
of
*NL*
views
,
that
the
pair
would
successfully
strike
up
.
They
would
become
*NL*
as
thick
as
thieves
--
which
moreover
was
but
a
development
of
what
*NL*
Strether
remembered
to
have
said
in
one
of
his
first
discussions
with
*NL*
his
mate
,
struck
as
he
had
then
already
been
with
the
elements
of
*NL*
affinity
between
that
personage
and
Mrs.
Newsome
herself
.
``
I
told
him
,
*NL*
one
day
,
when
he
had
questioned
me
on
your
mother
,
that
she
was
a
*NL*
person
who
,
when
he
should
know
her
,
would
rouse
in
him
,
I
was
sure
,
a
*NL*
special
enthusiasm
;
and
that
hangs
together
with
the
conviction
we
now
*NL*
feel
--
this
certitude
that
Mrs.
Pocock
will
take
him
into
her
boat
.
For
*NL*
it
's
your
mother
's
own
boat
that
she
's
pulling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
Mother
's
worth
fifty
of
Sally
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thousand
;
but
when
you
presently
meet
her
,
all
the
same
you
'll
be
*NL*
meeting
your
mother
's
representative
--
just
as
I
shall
.
I
feel
like
the
*NL*
outgoing
ambassador
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
doing
honour
to
his
appointed
*NL*
successor
.
''
A
moment
after
speaking
as
he
had
just
done
he
felt
he
had
*NL*
inadvertently
rather
cheapened
Mrs.
Newsome
to
her
son
;
an
impression
*NL*
audibly
reflected
,
as
at
first
seen
,
in
Chad
's
prompt
protest
.
He
had
*NL*
recently
rather
failed
of
apprehension
of
the
young
man
's
attitude
and
*NL*
temper
--
remaining
principally
conscious
of
how
little
worry
,
at
the
*NL*
worst
,
he
wasted
,
and
he
studied
him
at
this
critical
hour
with
renewed
*NL*
interest
.
Chad
had
done
exactly
what
he
had
promised
him
a
fortnight
*NL*
previous
--
had
accepted
without
another
question
his
plea
for
delay
.
He
*NL*
was
waiting
cheerfully
and
handsomely
,
but
also
inscrutably
and
with
a
*NL*
slight
increase
perhaps
of
the
hardness
originally
involved
in
his
*NL*
acquired
high
polish
.
He
was
neither
excited
nor
depressed
;
was
easy
*NL*
and
acute
and
deliberate
--
unhurried
unflurried
unworried
,
only
at
most
*NL*
a
little
less
amused
than
usual
.
Strether
felt
him
more
than
ever
a
*NL*
justification
of
the
extraordinary
process
of
which
his
own
absurd
*NL*
spirit
had
been
the
arena
;
he
knew
as
their
cab
rolled
along
,
knew
as
*NL*
he
had
n't
even
yet
known
,
that
nothing
else
than
what
Chad
had
done
and
*NL*
had
been
would
have
led
to
his
present
showing
.
They
had
made
him
,
*NL*
these
things
,
what
he
was
,
and
the
business
had
n't
been
easy
;
it
had
*NL*
taken
time
and
trouble
,
it
had
cost
,
above
all
,
a
price
.
The
result
at
*NL*
any
rate
was
now
to
be
offered
to
Sally
;
which
Strether
,
so
far
as
that
*NL*
was
concerned
,
was
glad
to
be
there
to
witness
.
Would
she
in
the
least
*NL*
make
it
out
or
take
it
in
,
the
result
,
or
would
she
in
the
least
care
*NL*
for
it
if
she
did
?
He
scratched
his
chin
as
he
asked
himself
by
what
*NL*
name
,
when
challenged
--
as
he
was
sure
he
should
be
--
he
could
call
it
*NL*
for
her
.
Oh
those
were
determinations
she
must
herself
arrive
at
;
*NL*
since
she
wanted
so
much
to
see
,
let
her
see
then
and
welcome
.
She
had
*NL*
come
out
in
the
pride
of
her
competence
,
yet
it
hummed
in
Strether
's
*NL*
inner
sense
that
she
practically
would
n't
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
this
was
moreover
what
Chad
shrewdly
suspected
was
clear
from
a
*NL*
word
that
next
dropped
from
him
.
``
They
're
children
;
they
play
at
*NL*
life
!
''
--
and
the
exclamation
was
significant
and
reassuring
.
It
implied
*NL*
that
he
had
n't
then
,
for
his
companion
's
sensibility
,
appeared
to
give
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
away
;
and
it
facilitated
our
friend
's
presently
asking
him
*NL*
if
it
were
his
idea
that
Mrs.
Pocock
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
should
*NL*
become
acquainted
.
Strether
was
still
more
sharply
struck
,
hereupon
,
*NL*
with
Chad
's
lucidity
.
``
Why
,
is
n't
that
exactly
--
to
get
a
sight
of
the
*NL*
company
I
keep
--
what
she
has
come
out
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
'm
afraid
it
is
,
''
Strether
unguardedly
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
's
quick
rejoinder
lighted
his
precipitation
.
``
Why
do
you
say
*NL*
you
're
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
because
I
feel
a
certain
responsibility
.
It
's
my
testimony
,
I
*NL*
imagine
,
that
will
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
Mrs.
Pocock
's
curiosity
.
*NL*
My
letters
,
as
I
've
supposed
you
to
understand
from
the
beginning
,
have
*NL*
spoken
freely
.
I
've
certainly
said
my
little
say
about
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
,
for
Chad
,
was
beautifully
obvious
.
``
Yes
,
but
you
've
only
*NL*
spoken
handsomely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
more
handsomely
of
any
woman
.
But
it
's
just
that
tone
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
tone
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
that
has
fetched
her
?
I
dare
say
;
but
I
've
no
*NL*
quarrel
with
you
about
it
.
And
no
more
has
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
Do
n't
*NL*
you
know
by
this
time
how
she
likes
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
--
and
Strether
had
,
with
his
groan
,
a
real
pang
of
melancholy
.
*NL*
``
For
all
I
've
done
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
you
've
done
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
's
urbanity
fairly
shamed
him
,
and
he
was
at
this
moment
absolutely
*NL*
impatient
to
see
the
face
Sarah
Pocock
would
present
to
a
sort
of
*NL*
thing
,
as
he
synthetically
phrased
it
to
himself
,
with
no
adequate
*NL*
forecast
of
which
,
despite
his
admonitions
,
she
would
certainly
arrive
.
*NL*
``
I
've
done
THIS
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
all
right
.
She
likes
,
''
Chad
comfortably
remarked
,
*NL*
``
to
be
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
his
companion
a
moment
's
thought
.
``
And
she
's
sure
Mrs.
Pocock
*NL*
WILL
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
say
that
for
you
.
She
likes
your
liking
her
;
it
's
so
much
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
''
Chad
laughed
,
``
to
the
good
.
However
,
she
does
n't
despair
of
*NL*
Sarah
either
,
and
is
prepared
,
on
her
own
side
,
to
go
all
lengths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
way
of
appreciation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
of
everything
else
.
In
the
way
of
general
amiability
,
*NL*
hospitality
and
welcome
.
She
's
under
arms
,
''
Chad
laughed
again
;
``
she
's
*NL*
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
it
in
;
then
as
if
an
echo
of
Miss
Barrace
were
in
the
*NL*
air
:
``
She
's
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
begin
to
know
HOW
wonderful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
depth
in
it
,
to
Strether
's
ear
,
of
confirmed
luxury
--
almost
*NL*
a
kind
of
unconscious
insolence
of
proprietorship
;
but
the
effect
of
*NL*
the
glimpse
was
not
at
this
moment
to
foster
speculation
:
there
was
*NL*
something
so
conclusive
in
so
much
graceful
and
generous
assurance
.
It
*NL*
was
in
fact
a
fresh
evocation
;
and
the
evocation
had
before
many
*NL*
minutes
another
consequence
.
``
Well
,
I
shall
see
her
oftener
now
.
I
*NL*
shall
see
her
as
much
as
I
like
--
by
your
leave
;
which
is
what
I
*NL*
hitherto
have
n't
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
,
''
said
Chad
,
but
without
reproach
,
``
only
your
own
fault
.
I
*NL*
tried
to
bring
you
together
,
and
SHE
,
my
dear
fellow
--
I
never
saw
her
*NL*
more
charming
to
any
man
.
But
you
've
got
your
extraordinary
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
DID
have
,
''
Strether
murmured
,
while
he
felt
both
how
they
had
*NL*
possessed
him
and
how
they
had
now
lost
their
authority
.
He
could
n't
*NL*
have
traced
the
sequence
to
the
end
,
but
it
was
all
because
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
.
Mrs.
Pocock
might
be
because
of
Mrs.
Newsome
,
but
that
was
*NL*
still
to
be
proved
.
What
came
over
him
was
the
sense
of
having
*NL*
stupidly
failed
to
profit
where
profit
would
have
been
precious
.
It
*NL*
had
been
open
to
him
to
see
so
much
more
of
her
,
and
he
had
but
let
the
*NL*
good
days
pass
.
Fierce
in
him
almost
was
the
resolve
to
lose
no
more
*NL*
of
them
,
and
he
whimsically
reflected
,
while
at
Chad
's
side
he
drew
*NL*
nearer
to
his
destination
,
that
it
was
after
all
Sarah
who
would
have
*NL*
quickened
his
chance
.
What
her
visit
of
inquisition
might
achieve
in
*NL*
other
directions
was
as
yet
all
obscure
--
only
not
obscure
that
it
would
*NL*
do
supremely
much
to
bring
two
earnest
persons
together
.
He
had
but
to
*NL*
listen
to
Chad
at
this
moment
to
feel
it
;
for
Chad
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
remarking
to
him
that
they
of
course
both
counted
on
him
--
he
himself
*NL*
and
the
other
earnest
person
--
for
cheer
and
support
.
It
was
brave
to
*NL*
Strether
to
hear
him
talk
as
if
the
line
of
wisdom
they
had
struck
out
*NL*
was
to
make
things
ravishing
to
the
Pococks
.
No
,
if
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
compassed
THAT
,
compassed
the
ravishment
of
the
Pococks
,
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
would
be
prodigious
.
It
would
be
a
beautiful
plan
if
it
*NL*
succeeded
,
and
it
all
came
to
the
question
of
Sarah
's
being
really
*NL*
bribeable
.
The
precedent
of
his
own
case
helped
Strether
perhaps
but
*NL*
little
to
consider
she
might
prove
so
;
it
being
distinct
that
her
*NL*
character
would
rather
make
for
every
possible
difference
.
This
idea
*NL*
of
his
own
bribeability
set
him
apart
for
himself
;
with
the
further
*NL*
mark
in
fact
that
his
case
was
absolutely
proved
.
He
liked
always
,
*NL*
where
Lambert
Strether
was
concerned
,
to
know
the
worst
,
and
what
he
*NL*
now
seemed
to
know
was
not
only
that
he
was
bribeable
,
but
that
he
had
*NL*
been
effectually
bribed
.
The
only
difficulty
was
that
he
could
n't
*NL*
quite
have
said
with
what
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
sold
himself
,
but
*NL*
had
n't
somehow
got
the
cash
.
That
,
however
,
was
what
,
*NL*
characteristically
,
WOULD
happen
to
him
.
It
would
naturally
be
his
*NL*
kind
of
traffic
.
While
he
thought
of
these
things
he
reminded
Chad
of
*NL*
the
truth
they
must
n't
lose
sight
of
--
the
truth
that
,
with
all
*NL*
deference
to
her
susceptibility
to
new
interests
,
Sarah
would
have
come
*NL*
out
with
a
high
firm
definite
purpose
.
``
She
has
n't
come
out
,
you
know
,
*NL*
to
be
bamboozled
.
We
may
all
be
ravishing
--
nothing
perhaps
can
be
more
*NL*
easy
for
us
;
but
she
has
n't
come
out
to
be
ravished
.
She
has
come
out
*NL*
just
simply
to
take
you
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
with
HER
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Chad
good-humouredly
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
you
'll
allow
THAT
.
''
And
then
as
for
a
minute
Strether
said
nothing
:
*NL*
``
Or
is
your
idea
that
when
I
've
seen
her
I
sha
n't
want
to
go
?
''
As
this
*NL*
question
,
however
,
again
left
his
friend
silent
he
presently
went
on
:
*NL*
``
My
own
idea
at
any
rate
is
that
they
shall
have
while
they
're
here
the
*NL*
best
sort
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
that
Strether
spoke
.
``
Ah
there
you
are
!
I
think
if
you
*NL*
really
wanted
to
go
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Chad
to
bring
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
would
n't
trouble
about
our
good
time
.
You
would
n't
care
*NL*
what
sort
of
a
time
we
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
could
always
take
in
the
easiest
way
in
the
world
any
ingenious
*NL*
suggestion
.
``
I
see
.
But
can
I
help
it
?
I
'm
too
decent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
're
too
decent
!
''
Strether
heavily
sighed
.
And
he
felt
for
the
*NL*
moment
as
if
it
were
the
preposterous
end
of
his
mission
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
ministered
for
the
time
to
this
temporary
effect
that
Chad
made
no
*NL*
rejoinder
.
But
he
spoke
again
as
they
came
in
sight
of
the
station
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
introduce
her
to
Miss
Gostrey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
this
Strether
was
ready
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
have
n't
you
told
me
they
know
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
told
you
your
mother
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wo
n't
she
have
told
Sally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
one
of
the
things
I
want
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
find
she
HAS
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
then
,
you
mean
,
bring
them
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Chad
with
his
pleasant
promptness
:
``
to
show
her
there
's
*NL*
nothing
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
care
very
much
what
she
may
*NL*
think
there
's
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
it
represents
what
Mother
thinks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
what
DOES
your
mother
think
?
''
There
was
in
this
some
sound
of
*NL*
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
just
driving
up
,
and
help
,
of
a
sort
,
might
after
all
be
*NL*
quite
at
hand
.
``
Is
n't
that
,
my
dear
man
,
what
we
're
both
just
going
to
*NL*
make
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
quitted
the
station
half
an
hour
later
in
different
company
.
*NL*
Chad
had
taken
charge
,
for
the
journey
to
the
hotel
,
of
Sarah
,
Mamie
,
*NL*
the
maid
and
the
luggage
,
all
spaciously
installed
and
conveyed
;
and
it
*NL*
was
only
after
the
four
had
rolled
away
that
his
companion
got
into
a
*NL*
cab
with
Jim
.
A
strange
new
feeling
had
come
over
Strether
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
which
his
spirits
had
risen
;
it
was
as
if
what
had
*NL*
occurred
on
the
alighting
of
his
critics
had
been
something
other
than
*NL*
his
fear
,
though
his
fear
had
vet
not
been
of
an
instant
scene
of
*NL*
violence
.
His
impression
had
been
nothing
but
what
was
inevitable
--
he
*NL*
said
that
to
himself
;
yet
relief
and
reassurance
had
softly
dropped
*NL*
upon
him
.
Nothing
could
be
so
odd
as
to
be
indebted
for
these
things
*NL*
to
the
look
of
faces
and
the
sound
of
voices
that
had
been
with
him
to
*NL*
satiety
,
as
he
might
have
said
,
for
years
;
but
he
now
knew
,
all
the
*NL*
same
,
how
uneasy
he
had
felt
;
that
was
brought
home
to
him
by
his
*NL*
present
sense
of
a
respite
.
It
had
come
moreover
in
the
flash
of
an
*NL*
eye
,
it
had
come
in
the
smile
with
which
Sarah
,
whom
,
at
the
window
of
*NL*
her
compartment
,
they
had
effusively
greeted
from
the
platform
,
rustled
*NL*
down
to
them
a
moment
later
,
fresh
and
handsome
from
her
cool
June
*NL*
progress
through
the
charming
land
.
It
was
only
a
sign
,
but
enough
:
*NL*
she
was
going
to
be
gracious
and
unallusive
,
she
was
going
to
play
the
*NL*
larger
game
--
which
was
still
more
apparent
,
after
she
had
emerged
from
*NL*
Chad
's
arms
,
in
her
direct
greeting
to
the
valued
friend
of
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
WAS
then
as
much
as
ever
the
valued
friend
of
her
family
,
it
*NL*
was
something
he
could
at
all
events
go
on
with
;
and
the
manner
of
his
*NL*
response
to
it
expressed
even
for
himself
how
little
he
had
enjoyed
the
*NL*
prospect
of
ceasing
to
figure
in
that
likeness
.
He
had
always
seen
*NL*
Sarah
gracious
--
had
in
fact
rarely
seen
her
shy
or
dry
,
her
marked
*NL*
thin-lipped
smile
,
intense
without
brightness
and
as
prompt
to
act
as
*NL*
the
scrape
of
a
safety-match
;
the
protrusion
of
her
rather
remarkably
*NL*
long
chin
,
which
in
her
case
represented
invitation
and
urbanity
,
and
*NL*
not
,
as
in
most
others
,
pugnacity
and
defiance
;
the
penetration
of
her
*NL*
voice
to
a
distance
,
the
general
encouragement
and
approval
of
her
*NL*
manner
,
were
all
elements
with
which
intercourse
had
made
him
familiar
,
*NL*
but
which
he
noted
today
almost
as
if
she
had
been
a
new
acquaintance
.
*NL*
This
first
glimpse
of
her
had
given
a
brief
but
vivid
accent
to
her
*NL*
resemblance
to
her
mother
;
he
could
have
taken
her
for
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
while
she
met
his
eyes
as
the
train
rolled
into
the
station
.
It
was
an
*NL*
impression
that
quickly
dropped
;
Mrs.
Newsome
was
much
handsomer
,
and
*NL*
while
Sarah
inclined
to
the
massive
her
mother
had
,
at
an
age
,
still
*NL*
the
girdle
of
a
maid
;
also
the
latter
's
chin
was
rather
short
,
than
*NL*
long
,
and
her
smile
,
by
good
fortune
,
much
more
,
oh
ever
so
much
more
,
*NL*
mercifully
vague
.
Strether
had
seen
Mrs.
Newsome
reserved
;
he
had
*NL*
literally
heard
her
silent
,
though
he
had
never
known
her
unpleasant
.
*NL*
It
was
the
case
with
Mrs.
Pocock
that
he
had
known
HER
unpleasant
,
even
*NL*
though
he
had
never
known
her
not
affable
.
She
had
forms
of
affability
*NL*
that
were
in
a
high
degree
assertive
;
nothing
for
instance
had
ever
*NL*
been
more
striking
than
that
she
was
affable
to
Jim
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
told
in
any
case
at
the
window
of
the
train
was
her
high
clear
*NL*
forehead
,
that
forehead
which
her
friends
,
for
some
reason
,
always
*NL*
thought
of
as
a
``
brow
''
;
the
long
reach
of
her
eyes
--
it
came
out
at
this
*NL*
juncture
in
such
a
manner
as
to
remind
him
,
oddly
enough
,
also
of
that
*NL*
of
Waymarsh
's
;
and
the
unusual
gloss
of
her
dark
hair
,
dressed
and
*NL*
hatted
,
after
her
mother
's
refined
example
,
with
such
an
avoidance
of
*NL*
extremes
that
it
was
always
spoken
of
at
Woollett
as
``
their
own
.
''
*NL*
Though
this
analogy
dropped
as
soon
as
she
was
on
the
platform
it
had
*NL*
lasted
long
enough
to
make
him
feel
all
the
advantage
,
as
it
were
,
of
*NL*
his
relief
.
The
woman
at
home
,
the
woman
to
whom
he
was
attached
,
was
*NL*
before
him
just
long
enough
to
give
him
again
the
measure
of
the
*NL*
wretchedness
,
in
fact
really
of
the
shame
,
of
their
having
to
recognise
*NL*
the
formation
,
between
them
,
of
a
``
split
.
''
He
had
taken
this
measure
*NL*
in
solitude
and
meditation
:
but
the
catastrophe
,
as
Sarah
steamed
up
,
*NL*
looked
for
its
seconds
unprecedentedly
dreadful
--
or
proved
,
more
*NL*
exactly
,
altogether
unthinkable
;
so
that
his
finding
something
free
and
*NL*
familiar
to
respond
to
brought
with
it
an
instant
renewal
of
his
*NL*
loyalty
.
He
had
suddenly
sounded
the
whole
depth
,
had
gasped
at
what
*NL*
he
might
have
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
could
now
,
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
of
their
detention
hover
*NL*
about
the
travellers
as
soothingly
as
if
their
direct
message
to
him
*NL*
was
that
he
had
lost
nothing
.
He
was
n't
going
to
have
Sarah
write
to
*NL*
her
mother
that
night
that
he
was
in
any
way
altered
or
strange
.
There
*NL*
had
been
times
enough
for
a
month
when
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
*NL*
strange
,
that
he
was
altered
,
in
every
way
;
but
that
was
a
matter
for
*NL*
himself
;
he
knew
at
least
whose
business
it
was
not
;
it
was
not
at
all
*NL*
events
such
a
circumstance
as
Sarah
's
own
unaided
lights
would
help
her
*NL*
to
.
Even
if
she
had
come
out
to
flash
those
lights
more
than
yet
*NL*
appeared
she
would
n't
make
much
headway
against
mere
pleasantness
.
He
*NL*
counted
on
being
able
to
be
merely
pleasant
to
the
end
,
and
if
only
*NL*
from
incapacity
moreover
to
formulate
anything
different
.
He
could
n't
*NL*
even
formulate
to
himself
his
being
changed
and
queer
;
it
had
taken
*NL*
place
,
the
process
,
somewhere
deep
down
;
Maria
Gostrey
had
caught
*NL*
glimpses
of
it
;
but
how
was
he
to
fish
it
up
,
even
if
he
desired
,
for
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocock
?
This
was
then
the
spirit
in
which
he
hovered
,
and
with
*NL*
the
easier
throb
in
it
much
indebted
furthermore
to
the
impression
of
*NL*
high
and
established
adequacy
as
a
pretty
girl
promptly
produced
in
him
*NL*
by
Mamie
.
He
had
wondered
vaguely
--
turning
over
many
things
in
the
*NL*
fidget
of
his
thoughts
--
if
Mamie
WERE
as
pretty
as
Woollett
published
*NL*
her
;
as
to
which
issue
seeing
her
now
again
was
to
be
so
swept
away
by
*NL*
Woollett
's
opinion
that
this
consequence
really
let
loose
for
the
*NL*
imagination
an
avalanche
of
others
.
There
were
positively
five
minutes
*NL*
in
which
the
last
word
seemed
of
necessity
to
abide
with
a
Woollett
*NL*
represented
by
a
Mamie
.
This
was
the
sort
of
truth
the
place
itself
*NL*
would
feel
;
it
would
send
her
forth
in
confidence
;
it
would
point
to
*NL*
her
with
triumph
;
it
would
take
its
stand
on
her
with
assurance
;
it
*NL*
would
be
conscious
of
no
requirements
she
did
n't
meet
,
of
no
question
*NL*
she
could
n't
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
right
,
Strether
slipped
smoothly
enough
into
the
*NL*
cheerfulness
of
saying
:
granted
that
a
community
MIGHT
be
best
*NL*
represented
by
a
young
lady
of
twenty-two
,
Mamie
perfectly
played
the
*NL*
part
,
played
it
as
if
she
were
used
to
it
,
and
looked
and
spoke
and
*NL*
dressed
the
character
.
He
wondered
if
she
might
n't
,
in
the
high
light
*NL*
of
Paris
,
a
cool
full
studio-light
,
becoming
yet
treacherous
,
show
as
*NL*
too
conscious
of
these
matters
;
but
the
next
moment
he
felt
satisfied
*NL*
that
her
consciousness
was
after
all
empty
for
its
size
,
rather
too
*NL*
simple
than
too
mixed
,
and
that
the
kind
way
with
her
would
be
not
to
*NL*
take
many
things
out
of
it
,
but
to
put
as
many
as
possible
in
.
She
was
*NL*
robust
and
conveniently
tall
;
just
a
trifle
too
bloodlessly
fair
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
with
a
pleasant
public
familiar
radiance
that
affirmed
her
*NL*
vitality
.
She
might
have
been
``
receiving
''
for
Woollett
,
wherever
she
*NL*
found
herself
,
and
there
was
something
in
her
manner
,
her
tone
,
her
*NL*
motion
,
her
pretty
blue
eyes
,
her
pretty
perfect
teeth
and
her
very
*NL*
small
,
too
small
,
nose
,
that
immediately
placed
her
,
to
the
fancy
,
*NL*
between
the
windows
of
a
hot
bright
room
in
which
voices
were
high
--
up
*NL*
at
that
end
to
which
people
were
brought
to
be
``
presented
.
''
They
were
*NL*
there
to
congratulate
,
these
images
,
and
Strether
's
renewed
vision
,
on
*NL*
this
hint
,
completed
the
idea
.
What
Mamie
was
like
was
the
happy
*NL*
bride
,
the
bride
after
the
church
and
just
before
going
away
.
She
*NL*
was
n't
the
mere
maiden
,
and
yet
was
only
as
much
married
as
that
*NL*
quantity
came
to
.
She
was
in
the
brilliant
acclaimed
festal
stage
.
*NL*
Well
,
might
it
last
her
long
!
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
rejoiced
in
these
things
for
Chad
,
who
was
all
genial
*NL*
attention
to
the
needs
of
his
friends
,
besides
having
arranged
that
his
*NL*
servant
should
reinforce
him
;
the
ladies
were
certainly
pleasant
to
*NL*
see
,
and
Mamie
would
be
at
any
time
and
anywhere
pleasant
to
exhibit
.
*NL*
She
would
look
extraordinarily
like
his
young
wife
--
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
honeymoon
,
should
he
go
about
with
her
;
but
that
was
his
own
affair
--
or
*NL*
perhaps
it
was
hers
;
it
was
at
any
rate
something
she
could
n't
help
.
*NL*
Strether
remembered
how
he
had
seen
him
come
up
with
Jeanne
de
Vionnet
*NL*
in
Gloriani
's
garden
,
and
the
fancy
he
had
had
about
that
--
the
fancy
*NL*
obscured
now
,
thickly
overlaid
with
others
;
the
recollection
was
during
*NL*
these
minutes
his
only
note
of
trouble
.
He
had
often
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
,
wondered
if
Chad
but
too
probably
were
not
with
Jeanne
the
*NL*
object
of
a
still
and
shaded
flame
.
It
was
on
the
cards
that
the
child
*NL*
MIGHT
be
tremulously
in
love
,
and
this
conviction
now
flickered
up
not
*NL*
a
bit
the
less
for
his
disliking
to
think
of
it
,
for
its
being
,
in
a
*NL*
complicated
situation
,
a
complication
the
more
,
and
for
something
*NL*
indescribable
in
Mamie
,
something
at
all
events
straightway
lent
her
by
*NL*
his
own
mind
,
something
that
gave
her
value
,
gave
her
intensity
and
*NL*
purpose
,
as
the
symbol
of
an
opposition
.
Little
Jeanne
was
n't
really
*NL*
at
all
in
question
--
how
COULD
she
be
?
--
yet
from
the
moment
Miss
Pocock
*NL*
had
shaken
her
skirts
on
the
platform
,
touched
up
the
immense
bows
of
*NL*
her
hat
and
settled
properly
over
her
shoulder
the
strap
of
her
*NL*
morocco-and-gilt
travelling-satchel
,
from
that
moment
little
Jeanne
was
*NL*
opposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
cab
with
Jim
that
impressions
really
crowded
on
Strether
,
*NL*
giving
him
the
strangest
sense
of
length
of
absence
from
people
among
*NL*
whom
he
had
lived
for
years
.
Having
them
thus
come
out
to
him
was
as
*NL*
if
he
had
returned
to
find
them
:
and
the
droll
promptitude
of
Jim
's
*NL*
mental
reaction
threw
his
own
initiation
far
back
into
the
past
.
*NL*
Whoever
might
or
might
n't
be
suited
by
what
was
going
on
among
them
,
*NL*
Jim
,
for
one
,
would
certainly
be
:
his
instant
recognition
--
frank
and
*NL*
whimsical
--
of
what
the
affair
was
for
HIM
gave
Strether
a
glow
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
``
I
say
,
you
know
,
this
IS
about
my
shape
,
and
if
it
had
n't
*NL*
been
for
YOU
--
!
''
so
he
broke
out
as
the
charming
streets
met
his
*NL*
healthy
appetite
;
and
he
wound
up
,
after
an
expressive
nudge
,
with
a
*NL*
clap
of
his
companion
's
knee
and
an
``
Oh
you
,
you
--
you
ARE
doing
it
!
''
*NL*
that
was
charged
with
rich
meaning
.
Strether
felt
in
it
the
intention
*NL*
of
homage
,
but
,
with
a
curiosity
otherwise
occupied
,
postponed
taking
*NL*
it
up
.
What
he
was
asking
himself
for
the
time
was
how
Sarah
Pocock
,
*NL*
in
the
opportunity
already
given
her
,
had
judged
her
brother
--
from
whom
*NL*
he
himself
,
as
they
finally
,
at
the
station
,
separated
for
their
*NL*
different
conveyances
,
had
had
a
look
into
which
he
could
read
more
*NL*
than
one
message
.
However
Sarah
was
judging
her
brother
,
Chad
's
*NL*
conclusion
about
his
sister
,
and
about
her
husband
and
her
husband
's
*NL*
sister
,
was
at
the
least
on
the
way
not
to
fail
of
confidence
.
Strether
*NL*
felt
the
confidence
,
and
that
,
as
the
look
between
them
was
an
*NL*
exchange
,
what
he
himself
gave
back
was
relatively
vague
.
This
*NL*
comparison
of
notes
however
could
wait
;
everything
struck
him
as
*NL*
depending
on
the
effect
produced
by
Chad
.
Neither
Sarah
nor
Mamie
had
*NL*
in
any
way
,
at
the
station
--
where
they
had
had
after
all
ample
*NL*
time
--
broken
out
about
it
;
which
,
to
make
up
for
this
,
was
what
our
*NL*
friend
had
expected
of
Jim
as
soon
as
they
should
find
themselves
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
queer
to
him
that
he
had
that
noiseless
brush
with
Chad
;
an
*NL*
ironic
intelligence
with
this
youth
on
the
subject
of
his
relatives
,
an
*NL*
intelligence
carried
on
under
their
nose
and
,
as
might
be
said
,
at
*NL*
their
expense
--
such
a
matter
marked
again
for
him
strongly
the
number
*NL*
of
stages
he
had
come
;
albeit
that
if
the
number
seemed
great
the
time
*NL*
taken
for
the
final
one
was
but
the
turn
of
a
hand
.
He
had
before
this
*NL*
had
many
moments
of
wondering
if
he
himself
were
n't
perhaps
changed
*NL*
even
as
Chad
was
changed
.
Only
what
in
Chad
was
conspicuous
*NL*
improvement
--
well
,
he
had
no
name
ready
for
the
working
,
in
his
own
*NL*
organism
,
of
his
own
more
timid
dose
.
He
should
have
to
see
first
what
*NL*
this
action
would
amount
to
.
And
for
his
occult
passage
with
the
young
*NL*
man
,
after
all
,
the
directness
of
it
had
no
greater
oddity
than
the
*NL*
fact
that
the
young
man
's
way
with
the
three
travellers
should
have
*NL*
been
so
happy
a
manifestation
.
Strether
liked
him
for
it
,
on
the
spot
,
*NL*
as
he
had
n't
yet
liked
him
;
it
affected
him
while
it
lasted
as
he
might
*NL*
have
been
affected
by
some
light
pleasant
perfect
work
of
art
:
to
that
*NL*
degree
that
he
wondered
if
they
were
really
worthy
of
it
,
took
it
in
*NL*
and
did
it
justice
;
to
that
degree
that
it
would
have
been
scarce
a
*NL*
miracle
if
,
there
in
the
luggage-room
,
while
they
waited
for
their
*NL*
things
,
Sarah
had
pulled
his
sleeve
and
drawn
him
aside
.
``
You
're
right
;
*NL*
we
have
n't
quite
known
what
you
mean
,
Mother
and
I
,
but
now
we
see
.
*NL*
Chad
's
magnificent
;
what
can
one
want
more
?
If
THIS
is
the
kind
of
*NL*
thing
--
!
''
On
which
they
might
,
as
it
were
,
have
embraced
and
begun
to
*NL*
work
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
how
much
,
as
it
was
,
for
all
her
bridling
brightness
--
which
was
*NL*
merely
general
and
noticed
nothing
--
WOULD
they
work
together
?
Strether
*NL*
knew
he
was
unreasonable
;
he
set
it
down
to
his
being
nervous
:
people
*NL*
could
n't
notice
everything
and
speak
of
everything
in
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
.
Possibly
,
no
doubt
,
also
,
he
made
too
much
of
Chad
's
display
.
*NL*
Yet
,
none
the
less
,
when
,
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
,
in
the
cab
,
Jim
*NL*
Pocock
had
said
nothing
either
--
had
n't
said
,
that
is
,
what
Strether
*NL*
wanted
,
though
he
had
said
much
else
--
it
all
suddenly
bounced
back
to
*NL*
their
being
either
stupid
or
wilful
.
It
was
more
probably
on
the
whole
*NL*
the
former
;
so
that
that
would
be
the
drawback
of
the
bridling
*NL*
brightness
.
Yes
,
they
would
bridle
and
be
bright
;
they
would
make
the
*NL*
best
of
what
was
before
them
,
but
their
observation
would
fail
;
it
*NL*
would
be
beyond
them
;
they
simply
would
n't
understand
.
Of
what
use
*NL*
would
it
be
then
that
they
had
come
?
--
if
they
were
n't
to
be
intelligent
*NL*
up
to
THAT
point
:
unless
indeed
he
himself
were
utterly
deluded
and
*NL*
extravagant
?
Was
he
,
on
this
question
of
Chad
's
improvement
,
fantastic
*NL*
and
away
from
the
truth
?
Did
he
live
in
a
false
world
,
a
world
that
*NL*
had
grown
simply
to
suit
him
,
and
was
his
present
slight
irritation
--
in
*NL*
the
face
now
of
Jim
's
silence
in
particular
--
but
the
alarm
of
the
vain
*NL*
thing
menaced
by
the
touch
of
the
real
?
Was
this
contribution
of
the
*NL*
real
possibly
the
mission
of
the
Pococks
?
--
had
they
come
to
make
the
*NL*
work
of
observation
,
as
HE
had
practised
observation
,
crack
and
*NL*
crumble
,
and
to
reduce
Chad
to
the
plain
terms
in
which
honest
minds
*NL*
could
deal
with
him
?
Had
they
come
in
short
to
be
sane
where
Strether
*NL*
was
destined
to
feel
that
he
himself
had
only
been
silly
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
such
a
contingency
,
but
it
failed
to
hold
him
long
when
*NL*
once
he
had
reflected
that
he
would
have
been
silly
,
in
this
case
,
with
*NL*
Maria
Gostrey
and
little
Bilham
,
with
Madame
de
Vionnet
and
little
*NL*
Jeanne
,
with
Lambert
Strether
,
in
fine
,
and
above
all
with
Chad
Newsome
*NL*
himself
.
Would
n't
it
be
found
to
have
made
more
for
reality
to
be
*NL*
silly
with
these
persons
than
sane
with
Sarah
and
Jim
?
Jim
in
fact
,
he
*NL*
presently
made
up
his
mind
,
was
individually
out
of
it
;
Jim
did
n't
*NL*
care
;
Jim
had
n't
come
out
either
for
Chad
or
for
him
;
Jim
in
short
left
*NL*
the
moral
side
to
Sally
and
indeed
simply
availed
himself
now
,
for
the
*NL*
sense
of
recreation
,
of
the
fact
that
he
left
almost
everything
to
*NL*
Sally
.
He
was
nothing
compared
to
Sally
,
and
not
so
much
by
reason
of
*NL*
Sally
's
temper
and
will
as
by
that
of
her
more
developed
type
and
*NL*
greater
acquaintance
with
the
world
.
He
quite
frankly
and
serenely
*NL*
confessed
,
as
he
sat
there
with
Strether
,
that
he
felt
his
type
hang
*NL*
far
in
the
rear
of
his
wife
's
and
still
further
,
if
possible
,
in
the
*NL*
rear
of
his
sister
's
.
Their
types
,
he
well
knew
,
were
recognised
and
*NL*
acclaimed
;
whereas
the
most
a
leading
Woollett
business-man
could
hope
*NL*
to
achieve
socially
,
and
for
that
matter
industrially
,
was
a
certain
*NL*
freedom
to
play
into
this
general
glamour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
he
made
on
our
friend
was
another
of
the
things
that
*NL*
marked
our
friend
's
road
.
It
was
a
strange
impression
,
especially
as
*NL*
so
soon
produced
;
Strether
had
received
it
,
he
judged
,
all
in
the
*NL*
twenty
minutes
;
it
struck
him
at
least
as
but
in
a
minor
degree
the
*NL*
work
of
the
long
Woollett
years
.
Pocock
was
normally
and
consentingly
*NL*
though
not
quite
wittingly
out
of
the
question
.
It
was
despite
his
*NL*
being
normal
;
it
was
despite
his
being
cheerful
;
it
was
despite
his
*NL*
being
a
leading
Woollett
business-man
;
and
the
determination
of
his
*NL*
fate
left
him
thus
perfectly
usual
--
as
everything
else
about
it
was
*NL*
clearly
,
to
his
sense
,
not
less
so
.
He
seemed
to
say
that
there
was
a
*NL*
whole
side
of
life
on
which
the
perfectly
usual
WAS
for
leading
*NL*
Woollett
business-men
to
be
out
of
the
question
.
He
made
no
more
of
it
*NL*
than
that
,
and
Strether
,
so
far
as
Jim
was
concerned
,
desired
to
make
*NL*
no
more
.
Only
Strether
's
imagination
,
as
always
,
worked
,
and
he
asked
*NL*
himself
if
this
side
of
life
were
not
somehow
connected
,
for
those
who
*NL*
figured
on
it
with
the
fact
of
marriage
.
Would
HIS
relation
to
it
,
had
*NL*
he
married
ten
years
before
,
have
become
now
the
same
as
Pocock
's
?
*NL*
Might
it
even
become
the
same
should
he
marry
in
a
few
months
?
Should
*NL*
he
ever
know
himself
as
much
out
of
the
question
for
Mrs.
Newsome
as
*NL*
Jim
knew
himself
--
in
a
dim
way
--
for
Mrs.
Jim
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
turn
his
eyes
in
that
direction
was
to
be
personally
reassured
;
he
*NL*
was
different
from
Pocock
;
he
had
affirmed
himself
differently
and
was
*NL*
held
after
all
in
higher
esteem
.
What
none
the
less
came
home
to
him
,
*NL*
however
,
at
this
hour
,
was
that
the
society
over
there
,
that
of
which
*NL*
Sarah
and
Mamie
--
and
,
in
a
more
eminent
way
,
Mrs.
Newsome
herself
--
were
*NL*
specimens
,
was
essentially
a
society
of
women
,
and
that
poor
Jim
was
n't
*NL*
in
it
.
He
himself
Lambert
Strether
,
WAS
as
yet
in
some
degree
--
which
*NL*
was
an
odd
situation
for
a
man
;
but
it
kept
coming
back
to
him
in
a
*NL*
whimsical
way
that
he
should
perhaps
find
his
marriage
had
cost
him
his
*NL*
place
.
This
occasion
indeed
,
whatever
that
fancy
represented
,
was
not
*NL*
a
time
of
sensible
exclusion
for
Jim
,
who
was
in
a
state
of
manifest
*NL*
response
to
the
charm
of
his
adventure
.
Small
and
fat
and
constantly
*NL*
facetious
,
straw-coloured
and
destitute
of
marks
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
practically
indistinguishable
had
n't
his
constant
preference
for
*NL*
light-grey
clothes
,
for
white
hats
,
for
very
big
cigars
and
very
little
*NL*
stories
,
done
what
it
could
for
his
identity
.
There
were
signs
in
him
,
*NL*
though
none
of
them
plaintive
,
of
always
paying
for
others
;
and
the
*NL*
principal
one
perhaps
was
just
this
failure
of
type
.
It
was
with
this
*NL*
that
he
paid
,
rather
than
with
fatigue
or
waste
;
and
also
doubtless
a
*NL*
little
with
the
effort
of
humour
--
never
irrelevant
to
the
conditions
,
*NL*
to
the
relations
,
with
which
he
was
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gurgled
his
joy
as
they
rolled
through
the
happy
streets
;
he
*NL*
declared
that
his
trip
was
a
regular
windfall
,
and
that
he
was
n't
*NL*
there
,
he
was
eager
to
remark
,
to
hang
back
from
anything
:
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
quite
what
Sally
had
come
for
,
but
HE
had
come
for
a
good
time
.
*NL*
Strether
indulged
him
even
while
wondering
if
what
Sally
wanted
her
*NL*
brother
to
go
back
for
was
to
become
like
her
husband
.
He
trusted
that
*NL*
a
good
time
was
to
be
,
out
and
out
,
the
programme
for
all
of
them
;
and
*NL*
he
assented
liberally
to
Jim
's
proposal
that
,
disencumbered
and
*NL*
irresponsible
--
his
things
were
in
the
omnibus
with
those
of
the
*NL*
others
--
they
should
take
a
further
turn
round
before
going
to
the
*NL*
hotel
.
It
was
n't
for
HIM
to
tackle
Chad
--
it
was
Sally
's
job
;
and
as
it
*NL*
would
be
like
her
,
he
felt
,
to
open
fire
on
the
spot
,
it
would
n't
be
*NL*
amiss
of
them
to
hold
off
and
give
her
time
.
Strether
,
on
his
side
,
*NL*
only
asked
to
give
her
time
;
so
he
jogged
with
his
companion
along
*NL*
boulevards
and
avenues
,
trying
to
extract
from
meagre
material
some
*NL*
forecast
of
his
catastrophe
.
He
was
quick
enough
to
see
that
Jim
*NL*
Pocock
declined
judgement
,
had
hovered
quite
round
the
outer
edge
of
*NL*
discussion
and
anxiety
,
leaving
all
analysis
of
their
question
to
the
*NL*
ladies
alone
and
now
only
feeling
his
way
toward
some
small
droll
*NL*
cynicism
.
It
broke
out
afresh
,
the
cynicism
--
it
had
already
shown
a
*NL*
flicker
--
in
a
but
slightly
deferred
:
``
Well
,
hanged
if
I
would
if
I
*NL*
were
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
you
would
n't
in
Chad
's
place
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
up
this
to
go
back
and
boss
the
advertising
!
''
Poor
Jim
,
with
his
*NL*
arms
folded
and
his
little
legs
out
in
the
open
fiacre
,
drank
in
the
*NL*
sparkling
Paris
noon
and
carried
his
eyes
from
one
side
of
their
vista
*NL*
to
the
other
.
``
Why
I
want
to
come
right
out
and
live
here
myself
.
And
*NL*
I
want
to
live
while
I
AM
here
too
.
I
feel
with
YOU
--
oh
you
've
been
*NL*
grand
,
old
man
,
and
I
've
twigged
--
that
it
ai
n't
right
to
worry
Chad
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
persecute
him
;
I
could
n't
in
conscience
.
It
's
thanks
to
*NL*
you
at
any
rate
that
I
'm
here
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
'm
much
obliged
.
You
're
a
*NL*
lovely
pair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
things
in
this
speech
that
Strether
let
pass
for
the
time
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
then
think
it
important
the
advertising
should
be
thoroughly
*NL*
taken
in
hand
?
Chad
WILL
be
,
so
far
as
capacity
is
concerned
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
``
the
man
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
he
get
his
capacity
,
''
Jim
asked
,
``
over
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
get
it
over
here
,
and
the
wonderful
thing
is
that
over
here
*NL*
he
has
n't
inevitably
lost
it
.
He
has
a
natural
turn
for
business
,
an
*NL*
extraordinary
head
.
He
comes
by
that
,
''
Strether
explained
,
``
honestly
*NL*
enough
.
He
's
in
that
respect
his
father
's
son
,
and
also
--
for
she
's
*NL*
wonderful
in
her
way
too
--
his
mother
's
.
He
has
other
tastes
and
other
*NL*
tendencies
;
but
Mrs.
Newsome
and
your
wife
are
quite
right
about
his
*NL*
having
that
.
He
's
very
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
he
is
!
''
Jim
Pocock
comfortably
sighed
.
``
But
if
you
've
*NL*
believed
so
in
his
making
us
hum
,
why
have
you
so
prolonged
the
*NL*
discussion
?
Do
n't
you
know
we
've
been
quite
anxious
about
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
questions
were
not
informed
with
earnestness
,
but
Strether
saw
he
*NL*
must
none
the
less
make
a
choice
and
take
a
line
.
``
Because
,
you
see
,
*NL*
I
've
greatly
liked
it
.
I
've
liked
my
Paris
,
I
dare
say
I
've
liked
it
*NL*
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
old
wretch
!
''
Jim
gaily
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
nothing
's
concluded
,
''
Strether
went
on
.
``
The
case
is
more
complex
*NL*
than
it
looks
from
Woollett
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
it
looks
bad
enough
from
Woollett
!
''
Jim
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
after
all
I
've
written
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
bethought
himself
.
``
Is
n't
it
what
you
've
written
that
has
made
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
pack
us
off
?
That
at
least
and
Chad
's
not
turning
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
made
a
reflexion
of
his
own
.
``
I
see
.
That
she
should
do
*NL*
something
was
,
no
doubt
,
inevitable
,
and
your
wife
has
therefore
of
*NL*
course
come
out
to
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
Jim
concurred
--
``
to
act
.
But
Sally
comes
out
to
act
,
you
*NL*
know
,
''
he
lucidly
added
,
``
every
time
she
leaves
the
house
.
She
never
*NL*
comes
out
but
she
DOES
act
.
She
's
acting
moreover
now
for
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
that
fixes
the
scale
.
''
Then
he
wound
up
,
opening
all
his
senses
to
*NL*
it
,
with
a
renewed
embrace
of
pleasant
Paris
.
``
We
have
n't
all
the
same
*NL*
at
Woollett
got
anything
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
continued
to
consider
.
``
I
'm
bound
to
say
for
you
all
that
you
*NL*
strike
me
as
having
arrived
in
a
very
mild
and
reasonable
frame
of
*NL*
mind
.
You
do
n't
show
your
claws
.
I
felt
just
now
in
Mrs.
Pocock
no
*NL*
symptom
of
that
.
She
is
n't
fierce
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
'm
such
a
nervous
*NL*
idiot
that
I
thought
she
might
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
do
n't
you
know
her
well
enough
,
''
Pocock
asked
,
``
to
have
noticed
*NL*
that
she
never
gives
herself
away
,
any
more
than
her
mother
ever
does
?
*NL*
They
ai
n't
fierce
,
either
of
'em
;
they
let
you
come
quite
close
.
They
*NL*
wear
their
fur
the
smooth
side
out
--
the
warm
side
in
.
Do
you
know
what
*NL*
they
are
?
''
Jim
pursued
as
he
looked
about
him
,
giving
the
question
,
as
*NL*
Strether
felt
,
but
half
his
care
--
``
do
you
know
what
they
are
?
They
're
*NL*
about
as
intense
as
they
can
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
''
--
and
Strether
's
concurrence
had
a
positive
precipitation
;
*NL*
``
they
're
about
as
intense
as
they
can
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
lash
about
and
shake
the
cage
,
''
said
Jim
,
who
seemed
*NL*
pleased
with
his
analogy
;
``
and
it
's
at
feeding-time
that
they
're
*NL*
quietest
.
But
they
always
get
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
indeed
--
they
always
get
there
!
''
Strether
replied
with
a
laugh
*NL*
that
justified
his
confession
of
nervousness
.
He
disliked
to
be
*NL*
talking
sincerely
of
Mrs.
Newsome
with
Pocock
;
he
could
have
talked
*NL*
insincerely
.
But
there
was
something
he
wanted
to
know
,
a
need
created
*NL*
in
him
by
her
recent
intermission
,
by
his
having
given
from
the
first
*NL*
so
much
,
as
now
more
than
ever
appeared
to
him
,
and
got
so
little
.
It
*NL*
was
as
if
a
queer
truth
in
his
companion
's
metaphor
had
rolled
over
him
*NL*
with
a
rush
.
She
HAD
been
quiet
at
feeding-time
;
she
had
fed
,
and
*NL*
Sarah
had
fed
with
her
,
out
of
the
big
bowl
of
all
his
recent
free
*NL*
communication
,
his
vividness
and
pleasantness
,
his
ingenuity
and
even
*NL*
his
eloquence
,
while
the
current
of
her
response
had
steadily
run
thin
.
*NL*
Jim
meanwhile
however
,
it
was
true
,
slipped
characteristically
into
*NL*
shallowness
from
the
moment
he
ceased
to
speak
out
of
the
experience
of
*NL*
a
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
course
Chad
has
now
the
advantage
of
being
there
before
her
.
If
*NL*
he
does
n't
work
that
for
all
it
's
worth
--
!
''
He
sighed
with
contingent
*NL*
pity
at
his
brother-in-law
's
possible
want
of
resource
.
``
He
has
worked
*NL*
it
on
YOU
,
pretty
well
,
eh
?
''
and
he
asked
the
next
moment
if
there
were
*NL*
anything
new
at
the
Varieties
,
which
he
pronounced
in
the
American
*NL*
manner
.
They
talked
about
the
Varieties
--
Strether
confessing
to
a
*NL*
knowledge
which
produced
again
on
Pocock
's
part
a
play
of
innuendo
as
*NL*
vague
as
a
nursery-rhyme
,
yet
as
aggressive
as
an
elbow
in
his
side
;
*NL*
and
they
finished
their
drive
under
the
protection
of
easy
themes
.
*NL*
Strether
waited
to
the
end
,
but
still
in
vain
,
for
any
show
that
Jim
*NL*
had
seen
Chad
as
different
;
and
he
could
scarce
have
explained
the
*NL*
discouragement
he
drew
from
the
absence
of
this
testimony
.
It
was
what
*NL*
he
had
taken
his
own
stand
on
,
so
far
as
he
had
taken
a
stand
;
and
if
*NL*
they
were
all
only
going
to
see
nothing
he
had
only
wasted
his
time
.
He
*NL*
gave
his
friend
till
the
very
last
moment
,
till
they
had
come
into
*NL*
sight
of
the
hotel
;
and
when
poor
Pocock
only
continued
cheerful
and
*NL*
envious
and
funny
he
fairly
grew
to
dislike
him
,
to
feel
him
*NL*
extravagantly
common
.
If
they
were
ALL
going
to
see
*NL*
nothing
!
--
Strether
knew
,
as
this
came
back
to
him
,
that
he
was
also
*NL*
letting
Pocock
represent
for
him
what
Mrs.
Newsome
would
n't
see
.
He
*NL*
went
on
disliking
,
in
the
light
of
Jim
's
commonness
,
to
talk
to
him
*NL*
about
that
lady
;
yet
just
before
the
cab
pulled
up
he
knew
the
extent
*NL*
of
his
desire
for
the
real
word
from
Woollett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Mrs.
Newsome
at
all
given
way
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Given
way
'
?
''
--
Jim
echoed
it
with
the
practical
derision
of
his
sense
*NL*
of
a
long
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
strain
,
I
mean
,
of
hope
deferred
,
of
disappointment
repeated
*NL*
and
thereby
intensified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
is
she
prostrate
,
you
mean
?
''
--
he
had
his
categories
in
hand
.
``
Why
*NL*
yes
,
she
's
prostrate
--
just
as
Sally
is
.
But
they
're
never
so
lively
,
*NL*
you
know
,
as
when
they
're
prostrate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
Sarah
's
prostrate
?
''
Strether
vaguely
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
when
they
're
prostrate
that
they
most
sit
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mrs.
Newsome
's
sitting
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
night
,
my
boy
--
for
YOU
!
''
And
Jim
fetched
him
,
with
a
vulgar
*NL*
little
guffaw
,
a
thrust
that
gave
relief
to
the
picture
.
But
he
had
*NL*
got
what
he
wanted
.
He
felt
on
the
spot
that
this
WAS
the
real
word
*NL*
from
Woollett
.
``
So
do
n't
you
go
home
!
''
Jim
added
while
he
alighted
and
*NL*
while
his
friend
,
letting
him
profusely
pay
the
cabman
,
sat
on
in
a
*NL*
momentary
muse
.
Strether
wondered
if
that
were
the
real
word
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
of
Mrs.
Pocock
's
salon
was
pushed
open
for
him
,
the
next
*NL*
day
,
well
before
noon
,
he
was
reached
by
a
voice
with
a
charming
sound
*NL*
that
made
him
just
falter
before
crossing
the
threshold
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
was
already
on
the
field
,
and
this
gave
the
drama
a
quicker
*NL*
pace
than
he
felt
it
as
yet
--
though
his
suspense
had
increased
--
in
the
*NL*
power
of
any
act
of
his
own
to
do
.
He
had
spent
the
previous
evening
*NL*
with
all
his
old
friends
together
yet
he
would
still
have
described
*NL*
himself
as
quite
in
the
dark
in
respect
to
a
forecast
of
their
*NL*
influence
on
his
situation
.
It
was
strange
now
,
none
the
less
,
that
in
*NL*
the
light
of
this
unexpected
note
of
her
presence
he
felt
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
a
part
of
that
situation
as
she
had
n't
even
yet
been
.
She
was
*NL*
alone
,
he
found
himself
assuming
,
with
Sarah
,
and
there
was
a
bearing
*NL*
in
that
--
somehow
beyond
his
control
--
on
his
personal
fate
.
Yet
she
was
*NL*
only
saying
something
quite
easy
and
independent
--
the
thing
she
had
*NL*
come
,
as
a
good
friend
of
Chad
's
,
on
purpose
to
say
.
``
There
is
n't
*NL*
anything
at
all
--
?
I
should
be
so
delighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
enough
,
when
they
were
there
before
him
,
how
she
had
been
*NL*
received
.
He
saw
this
,
as
Sarah
got
up
to
greet
him
,
from
something
*NL*
fairly
hectic
in
Sarah
's
face
.
He
saw
furthermore
that
they
were
n't
,
*NL*
as
had
first
come
to
him
,
alone
together
;
he
was
at
no
loss
as
to
the
*NL*
identity
of
the
broad
high
back
presented
to
him
in
the
embrasure
of
*NL*
the
window
furthest
from
the
door
.
Waymarsh
,
whom
he
had
to-day
not
yet
*NL*
seen
,
whom
he
only
knew
to
have
left
the
hotel
before
him
,
and
who
*NL*
had
taken
part
,
the
night
previous
,
on
Mrs.
Pocock
's
kind
invitation
,
*NL*
conveyed
by
Chad
,
in
the
entertainment
,
informal
but
cordial
,
promptly
*NL*
offered
by
that
lady
--
Waymarsh
had
anticipated
him
even
as
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
had
done
,
and
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
attitude
*NL*
unaffected
by
Strether
's
entrance
,
was
looking
out
,
in
marked
*NL*
detachment
,
at
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
.
The
latter
felt
it
in
the
air
--
it
*NL*
was
immense
how
Waymarsh
could
mark
things
--
that
he
had
remained
*NL*
deeply
dissociated
from
the
overture
to
their
hostess
that
we
have
*NL*
recorded
on
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
side
.
He
had
,
conspicuously
,
tact
,
*NL*
besides
a
stiff
general
view
;
and
this
was
why
he
had
left
Mrs.
Pocock
*NL*
to
struggle
alone
.
He
would
outstay
the
visitor
;
he
would
*NL*
unmistakeably
wait
;
to
what
had
he
been
doomed
for
months
past
but
*NL*
waiting
?
Therefore
she
was
to
feel
that
she
had
him
in
reserve
.
What
*NL*
support
she
drew
from
this
was
still
to
be
seen
,
for
,
although
Sarah
*NL*
was
vividly
bright
,
she
had
given
herself
up
for
the
moment
to
an
*NL*
ambiguous
flushed
formalism
.
She
had
had
to
reckon
more
quickly
than
*NL*
she
expected
;
but
it
concerned
her
first
of
all
to
signify
that
she
was
*NL*
not
to
be
taken
unawares
.
Strether
arrived
precisely
in
time
for
her
*NL*
showing
it
.
``
Oh
you
're
too
good
;
but
I
do
n't
think
I
feel
quite
*NL*
helpless
.
I
have
my
brother
--
and
these
American
friends
.
And
then
you
*NL*
know
I
've
been
to
Paris
.
I
KNOW
Paris
,
''
said
Sally
Pocock
in
a
tone
*NL*
that
breathed
a
certain
chill
on
Strether
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
a
woman
,
in
this
tiresome
place
where
everything
's
always
*NL*
changing
,
a
woman
of
good
will
,
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
threw
off
,
``
can
*NL*
always
help
a
woman
.
I
'm
sure
you
`
know
'
--
but
we
know
perhaps
*NL*
different
things
.
''
She
too
,
visibly
,
wished
to
make
no
mistake
;
but
it
*NL*
was
a
fear
of
a
different
order
and
more
kept
out
of
sight
.
She
smiled
*NL*
in
welcome
at
Strether
;
she
greeted
him
more
familiarly
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
;
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
without
moving
from
her
place
;
and
*NL*
it
came
to
him
in
the
course
of
a
minute
and
in
the
oddest
way
*NL*
that
--
yes
,
positively
--
she
was
giving
him
over
to
ruin
.
She
was
all
*NL*
kindness
and
ease
,
but
she
could
n't
help
so
giving
him
;
she
was
*NL*
exquisite
,
and
her
being
just
as
she
was
poured
for
Sarah
a
sudden
rush
*NL*
of
meaning
into
his
own
equivocations
.
How
could
she
know
how
she
was
*NL*
hurting
him
?
She
wanted
to
show
as
simple
and
humble
--
in
the
degree
*NL*
compatible
with
operative
charm
;
but
it
was
just
this
that
seemed
to
*NL*
put
him
on
her
side
.
She
struck
him
as
dressed
,
as
arranged
,
as
*NL*
prepared
infinitely
to
conciliate
--
with
the
very
poetry
of
good
taste
*NL*
in
her
view
of
the
conditions
of
her
early
call
.
She
was
ready
to
*NL*
advise
about
dressmakers
and
shops
;
she
held
herself
wholly
at
the
*NL*
disposition
of
Chad
's
family
.
Strether
noticed
her
card
on
the
*NL*
table
--
her
coronet
and
her
``
Comtesse
''
--
and
the
imagination
was
sharp
in
*NL*
him
of
certain
private
adjustments
in
Sarah
's
mind
.
She
had
never
,
he
*NL*
was
sure
,
sat
with
a
``
Comtesse
''
before
,
and
such
was
the
specimen
of
*NL*
that
class
he
had
been
keeping
to
play
on
her
.
She
had
crossed
the
sea
*NL*
very
particularly
for
a
look
at
her
;
but
he
read
in
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
*NL*
own
eyes
that
this
curiosity
had
n't
been
so
successfully
met
as
that
*NL*
she
herself
would
n't
now
have
more
than
ever
need
of
him
.
She
looked
*NL*
much
as
she
had
looked
to
him
that
morning
at
Notre
Dame
;
he
noted
in
*NL*
fact
the
suggestive
sameness
of
her
discreet
and
delicate
dress
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
speak
--
perhaps
a
little
prematurely
or
too
finely
--
of
the
*NL*
sense
in
which
she
would
help
Mrs.
Pocock
with
the
shops
.
The
way
that
*NL*
lady
took
her
in
,
moreover
,
added
depth
to
his
impression
of
what
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
,
by
their
common
wisdom
,
had
escaped
.
He
winced
as
he
saw
*NL*
himself
but
for
that
timely
prudence
ushering
in
Maria
as
a
guide
and
*NL*
an
example
.
There
was
however
a
touch
of
relief
for
him
in
his
*NL*
glimpse
,
so
far
as
he
had
got
it
,
of
Sarah
's
line
.
She
``
knew
Paris
.
''
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
,
for
that
matter
,
lightly
taken
this
up
.
``
Ah
*NL*
then
you
've
a
turn
for
that
,
an
affinity
that
belongs
to
your
family
.
*NL*
Your
brother
,
though
his
long
experience
makes
a
difference
,
I
admit
,
*NL*
has
become
one
of
us
in
a
marvellous
way
.
''
And
she
appealed
to
Strether
*NL*
in
the
manner
of
a
woman
who
could
always
glide
off
with
smoothness
*NL*
into
another
subject
.
Was
n't
HE
struck
with
the
way
Mr.
Newsome
had
*NL*
made
the
place
his
own
,
and
had
n't
he
been
in
a
position
to
profit
by
*NL*
his
friend
's
wondrous
expertness
?
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
felt
the
bravery
,
at
the
least
,
of
her
presenting
herself
so
*NL*
promptly
to
sound
that
note
,
and
yet
asked
himself
what
other
note
,
*NL*
after
all
,
she
COULD
strike
from
the
moment
she
presented
herself
at
*NL*
all
.
She
could
meet
Mrs.
Pocock
only
on
the
ground
of
the
obvious
,
and
*NL*
what
feature
of
Chad
's
situation
was
more
eminent
than
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
had
created
for
himself
a
new
set
of
circumstances
?
Unless
she
hid
*NL*
herself
altogether
she
could
show
but
as
one
of
these
,
an
illustration
*NL*
of
his
domiciled
and
indeed
of
his
confirmed
condition
.
And
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
all
this
in
her
charming
eyes
was
so
clear
and
fine
*NL*
that
as
she
thus
publicly
drew
him
into
her
boat
she
produced
in
him
*NL*
such
a
silent
agitation
as
he
was
not
to
fail
afterwards
to
denounce
as
*NL*
pusillanimous
.
``
Ah
do
n't
be
so
charming
to
me
!
--
for
it
makes
us
*NL*
intimate
,
and
after
all
what
IS
between
us
when
I
've
been
so
*NL*
tremendously
on
my
guard
and
have
seen
you
but
half
a
dozen
times
?
''
He
*NL*
recognised
once
more
the
perverse
law
that
so
inveterately
governed
his
*NL*
poor
personal
aspects
:
it
would
be
exactly
LIKE
the
way
things
always
*NL*
turned
out
for
him
that
he
should
affect
Mrs.
Pocock
and
Waymarsh
as
*NL*
launched
in
a
relation
in
which
he
had
really
never
been
launched
at
*NL*
all
.
They
were
at
this
very
moment
--
they
could
only
be
--
attributing
to
*NL*
him
the
full
licence
of
it
,
and
all
by
the
operation
of
her
own
tone
*NL*
with
him
;
whereas
his
sole
licence
had
been
to
cling
with
intensity
to
*NL*
the
brink
,
not
to
dip
so
much
as
a
toe
into
the
flood
.
But
the
flicker
*NL*
of
his
fear
on
this
occasion
was
not
,
as
may
be
added
,
to
repeat
*NL*
itself
;
it
sprang
up
,
for
its
moment
,
only
to
die
down
and
then
go
out
*NL*
for
ever
.
To
meet
his
fellow
visitor
's
invocation
and
,
with
Sarah
's
*NL*
brilliant
eyes
on
him
,
answer
,
WAS
quite
sufficiently
to
step
into
her
*NL*
boat
.
During
the
rest
of
the
time
her
visit
lasted
he
felt
himself
*NL*
proceed
to
each
of
the
proper
offices
,
successively
,
for
helping
to
*NL*
keep
the
adventurous
skiff
afloat
.
It
rocked
beneath
him
,
but
he
*NL*
settled
himself
in
his
place
.
He
took
up
an
oar
and
,
since
he
was
to
*NL*
have
the
credit
of
pulling
,
pulled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
make
it
all
the
pleasanter
if
it
so
happens
that
we
DO
*NL*
meet
,
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
further
observed
in
reference
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
's
mention
of
her
initiated
state
;
and
she
had
immediately
added
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
her
hostess
could
n't
be
in
need
with
the
good
offices
*NL*
of
Mr.
Strether
so
close
at
hand
.
``
It
's
he
,
I
gather
,
who
has
learnt
*NL*
to
know
his
Paris
,
and
to
love
it
,
better
than
any
one
ever
before
in
*NL*
so
short
a
time
;
so
that
between
him
and
your
brother
,
when
it
comes
to
*NL*
the
point
,
how
can
you
possibly
want
for
good
guidance
?
The
great
*NL*
thing
,
Mr.
Strether
will
show
you
,
''
she
smiled
,
``
is
just
to
let
one
's
*NL*
self
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
've
not
let
myself
go
very
far
,
''
Strether
answered
,
feeling
quite
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
called
upon
to
hint
to
Mrs.
Pocock
how
Parisians
*NL*
could
talk
.
``
I
'm
only
afraid
of
showing
I
have
n't
let
myself
go
far
*NL*
enough
.
I
've
taken
a
good
deal
of
time
,
but
I
must
quite
have
had
the
*NL*
air
of
not
budging
from
one
spot
.
''
He
looked
at
Sarah
in
a
manner
that
*NL*
he
thought
she
might
take
as
engaging
,
and
he
made
,
under
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
's
protection
,
as
it
were
,
his
first
personal
point
.
``
What
has
*NL*
really
happened
has
been
that
,
all
the
while
,
I
've
done
what
I
came
out
*NL*
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
only
at
first
gave
Madame
de
Vionnet
a
chance
immediately
to
*NL*
take
him
up
.
``
You
've
renewed
acquaintance
with
your
friend
--
you
've
*NL*
learnt
to
know
him
again
.
''
She
spoke
with
such
cheerful
helpfulness
*NL*
that
they
might
,
in
a
common
cause
,
have
been
calling
together
and
*NL*
pledged
to
mutual
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
,
at
this
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
question
,
straightway
turned
*NL*
from
the
window
.
``
Oh
yes
,
Countess
--
he
has
renewed
acquaintance
with
*NL*
ME
,
and
he
HAS
,
I
guess
,
learnt
something
about
me
,
though
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
much
he
has
liked
it
.
It
's
for
Strether
himself
to
say
whether
he
*NL*
has
felt
it
justifies
his
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
YOU
,
''
said
the
Countess
gaily
,
``
are
not
in
the
least
what
he
*NL*
came
out
for
--
is
he
really
,
Strether
?
and
I
had
n't
you
at
all
in
my
*NL*
mind
.
I
was
thinking
of
Mr.
Newsome
,
of
whom
we
think
so
much
and
with
*NL*
whom
,
precisely
,
Mrs.
Pocock
has
given
herself
the
opportunity
to
take
*NL*
up
threads
.
What
a
pleasure
for
you
both
!
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
with
her
*NL*
eyes
on
Sarah
,
bravely
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocock
met
her
handsomely
,
but
Strether
quickly
saw
she
meant
to
*NL*
accept
no
version
of
her
movements
or
plans
from
any
other
lips
.
She
*NL*
required
no
patronage
and
no
support
,
which
were
but
other
names
for
a
*NL*
false
position
;
she
would
show
in
her
own
way
what
she
chose
to
show
,
*NL*
and
this
she
expressed
with
a
dry
glitter
that
recalled
to
him
a
fine
*NL*
Woollett
winter
morning
.
``
I
've
never
wanted
for
opportunities
to
see
*NL*
my
brother
.
We
've
many
things
to
think
of
at
home
,
and
great
*NL*
responsibilities
and
occupations
,
and
our
home
's
not
an
impossible
*NL*
place
.
We
've
plenty
of
reasons
,
''
Sarah
continued
a
little
piercingly
,
*NL*
``
for
everything
we
do
''
--
and
in
short
she
would
n't
give
herself
the
*NL*
least
little
scrap
away
.
But
she
added
as
one
who
was
always
bland
and
*NL*
who
could
afford
a
concession
:
``
I
've
come
because
--
well
,
because
we
do
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
fortunately
!
''
--
Madame
de
Vionnet
breathed
it
to
the
air
.
Five
*NL*
minutes
later
they
were
on
their
feet
for
her
to
take
leave
,
standing
*NL*
together
in
an
affability
that
had
succeeded
in
surviving
a
further
*NL*
exchange
of
remarks
;
only
with
the
emphasised
appearance
on
Waymarsh
's
*NL*
part
of
a
tendency
to
revert
,
in
a
ruminating
manner
and
as
with
an
*NL*
instinctive
or
a
precautionary
lightening
of
his
tread
,
to
an
open
*NL*
window
and
his
point
of
vantage
.
The
glazed
and
gilded
room
,
all
red
*NL*
damask
,
ormolu
,
mirrors
,
clocks
,
looked
south
,
and
the
shutters
were
*NL*
bowed
upon
the
summer
morning
;
but
the
Tuileries
garden
and
what
was
*NL*
beyond
it
,
over
which
the
whole
place
hung
,
were
things
visible
through
*NL*
gaps
;
so
that
the
far-spreading
presence
of
Paris
came
up
in
coolness
,
*NL*
dimness
and
invitation
,
in
the
twinkle
of
gilt-tipped
palings
,
the
*NL*
crunch
of
gravel
,
the
click
of
hoofs
,
the
crack
of
whips
,
things
that
*NL*
suggested
some
parade
of
the
circus
.
``
I
think
it
probable
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
,
``
that
I
shall
have
the
opportunity
of
going
to
my
brother
's
*NL*
I
've
no
doubt
it
's
very
pleasant
indeed
.
''
She
spoke
as
to
Strether
,
but
*NL*
her
face
was
turned
with
an
intensity
of
brightness
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
,
and
there
was
a
moment
during
which
,
while
she
thus
fronted
*NL*
her
,
our
friend
expected
to
hear
her
add
:
``
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
,
for
inviting
me
there
.
''
He
guessed
that
for
five
seconds
*NL*
these
words
were
on
the
point
of
coming
;
he
heard
them
as
clearly
as
if
*NL*
they
had
been
spoken
;
but
he
presently
knew
they
had
just
failed
--
knew
*NL*
it
by
a
glance
,
quick
and
fine
,
from
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
which
told
him
*NL*
that
she
too
had
felt
them
in
the
air
,
but
that
the
point
had
luckily
*NL*
not
been
made
in
any
manner
requiring
notice
.
This
left
her
free
to
*NL*
reply
only
to
what
had
been
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
may
be
common
ground
for
us
offers
me
*NL*
the
best
prospect
I
see
for
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
shall
come
to
see
you
,
since
you
've
been
so
good
''
:
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
looked
her
invader
well
in
the
eyes
.
The
flush
in
Sarah
's
*NL*
cheeks
had
by
this
time
settled
to
a
small
definite
crimson
spot
that
*NL*
was
not
without
its
own
bravery
;
she
held
her
head
a
good
deal
up
,
and
*NL*
it
came
to
Strether
that
of
the
two
,
at
this
moment
,
she
was
the
one
*NL*
who
most
carried
out
the
idea
of
a
Countess
.
He
quite
took
in
,
*NL*
however
,
that
she
would
really
return
her
visitor
's
civility
:
she
*NL*
would
n't
report
again
at
Woollett
without
at
least
so
much
producible
*NL*
history
as
that
in
her
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
extremely
to
be
able
to
show
you
my
little
daughter
.
''
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
went
on
;
``
and
I
should
have
brought
her
with
me
if
I
had
n't
*NL*
wished
first
to
ask
your
leave
.
I
was
in
hopes
I
should
perhaps
find
*NL*
Miss
Pocock
,
of
whose
being
with
you
I
've
heard
from
Mr.
Newsome
and
*NL*
whose
acquaintance
I
should
so
much
like
my
child
to
make
.
If
I
have
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
you
do
permit
it
I
shall
venture
to
ask
*NL*
her
to
be
kind
to
Jeanne
.
Mr.
Strether
will
tell
you
''
--
she
beautifully
*NL*
kept
it
up
--
``
that
my
poor
girl
is
gentle
and
good
and
rather
lonely
.
*NL*
They
've
made
friends
,
he
and
she
,
ever
so
happily
,
and
he
does
n't
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
think
ill
of
her
.
As
for
Jeanne
herself
he
has
had
the
same
*NL*
success
with
her
that
I
know
he
has
had
here
wherever
he
has
turned
.
''
*NL*
She
seemed
to
ask
him
for
permission
to
say
these
things
,
or
seemed
*NL*
rather
to
take
it
,
softly
and
happily
,
with
the
ease
of
intimacy
,
for
*NL*
granted
,
and
he
had
quite
the
consciousness
now
that
not
to
meet
her
at
*NL*
any
point
more
than
halfway
would
be
odiously
,
basely
to
abandon
her
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
was
WITH
her
,
and
,
opposed
even
in
this
covert
,
this
semi-safe
*NL*
fashion
to
those
who
were
not
,
he
felt
,
strangely
and
confusedly
,
but
*NL*
excitedly
,
inspiringly
,
how
much
and
how
far
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
positively
waited
in
suspense
for
something
from
her
that
would
let
him
*NL*
in
deeper
,
so
that
he
might
show
her
how
he
could
take
it
.
And
what
*NL*
did
in
fact
come
as
she
drew
out
a
little
her
farewell
served
*NL*
sufficiently
the
purpose
.
``
As
his
success
is
a
matter
that
I
'm
sure
*NL*
he
'll
never
mention
for
himself
,
I
feel
,
you
see
,
the
less
scruple
;
*NL*
which
it
's
very
good
of
me
to
say
,
you
know
,
by
the
way
,
''
she
added
as
*NL*
she
addressed
herself
to
him
;
``
considering
how
little
direct
advantage
*NL*
I
've
gained
from
your
triumphs
with
ME
.
When
does
one
ever
see
you
?
I
*NL*
wait
at
home
and
I
languish
.
You
'll
have
rendered
me
the
service
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
,
at
least
,
''
she
wound
up
,
``
of
giving
me
one
of
my
much-too-rare
*NL*
glimpses
of
this
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
should
be
sorry
to
deprive
you
of
anything
that
seems
so
*NL*
much
,
as
you
describe
it
,
your
natural
due
.
Mr.
Strether
and
I
are
*NL*
very
old
friends
,
''
Sarah
allowed
,
``
but
the
privilege
of
his
society
*NL*
is
n't
a
thing
I
shall
quarrel
about
with
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
dear
Sarah
,
''
he
freely
broke
in
,
``
I
feel
,
when
I
hear
you
say
*NL*
that
,
that
you
do
n't
quite
do
justice
to
the
important
truth
of
the
*NL*
extent
to
which
--
as
you
're
also
mine
--
I
'm
your
natural
due
.
I
should
*NL*
like
much
better
,
''
he
laughed
,
``
to
see
you
fight
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
him
,
Mrs.
Pocock
,
on
this
,
with
an
arrest
of
speech
--
with
a
*NL*
certain
breathlessness
,
as
he
immediately
fancied
,
on
the
score
of
a
*NL*
freedom
for
which
she
was
n't
quite
prepared
.
It
had
flared
up
--
for
all
*NL*
the
harm
he
had
intended
by
it
--
because
,
confoundedly
,
he
did
n't
want
*NL*
any
more
to
be
afraid
about
her
than
he
wanted
to
be
afraid
about
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
He
had
never
,
naturally
,
called
her
anything
but
*NL*
Sarah
at
home
,
and
though
he
had
perhaps
never
quite
so
markedly
*NL*
invoked
her
as
his
``
dear
,
''
that
was
somehow
partly
because
no
occasion
*NL*
had
hitherto
laid
so
effective
a
trap
for
it
.
But
something
admonished
*NL*
him
now
that
it
was
too
late
--
unless
indeed
it
were
possibly
too
early
;
*NL*
and
that
he
at
any
rate
should
n't
have
pleased
Mrs.
Pocock
the
more
by
*NL*
it
.
``
Well
,
Mr.
Strether
--
!
''
she
murmured
with
vagueness
,
yet
with
*NL*
sharpness
,
while
her
crimson
spot
burned
a
trifle
brighter
and
he
was
*NL*
aware
that
this
must
be
for
the
present
the
limit
of
her
response
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
already
,
however
,
come
to
his
aid
,
and
Waymarsh
,
*NL*
as
if
for
further
participation
,
moved
again
back
to
them
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
the
aid
rendered
by
Madame
de
Vionnet
was
questionable
;
it
was
a
*NL*
sign
that
,
for
all
one
might
confess
to
with
her
,
and
for
all
she
might
*NL*
complain
of
not
enjoying
,
she
could
still
insidiously
show
how
much
of
*NL*
the
material
of
conversation
had
accumulated
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
real
truth
is
,
you
know
,
that
you
sacrifice
one
without
mercy
to
*NL*
dear
old
Maria
.
She
leaves
no
room
in
your
life
for
anybody
else
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
,
''
she
enquired
of
Mrs.
Pocock
,
``
about
dear
old
Maria
?
The
*NL*
worst
is
that
Miss
Gostrey
is
really
a
wonderful
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
indeed
,
''
Strether
answered
for
her
,
``
Mrs.
Pocock
knows
about
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
.
Your
mother
,
Sarah
,
must
have
told
you
about
her
;
your
*NL*
mother
knows
everything
,
''
he
sturdily
pursued
.
``
And
I
cordially
*NL*
admit
,
''
he
added
with
his
conscious
gaiety
of
courage
,
``
that
she
's
as
*NL*
wonderful
a
woman
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
it
is
n't
I
who
`
like
,
'
dear
Mr.
Strether
,
anything
to
do
with
the
*NL*
matter
!
''
Sarah
Pocock
promptly
protested
;
``
and
I
'm
by
no
means
sure
I
*NL*
have
--
from
my
mother
or
from
any
one
else
--
a
notion
of
whom
you
're
*NL*
talking
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
wo
n't
let
you
see
her
,
you
know
,
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
sympathetically
threw
in
.
``
He
never
lets
me
--
old
friends
as
we
are
:
I
*NL*
mean
as
I
am
with
Maria
.
He
reserves
her
for
his
best
hours
;
keeps
her
*NL*
consummately
to
himself
;
only
gives
us
others
the
crumbs
of
the
feast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Countess
,
I
'VE
had
some
of
the
crumbs
,
''
Waymarsh
observed
with
*NL*
weight
and
covering
her
with
his
large
look
;
which
led
her
to
break
in
*NL*
before
he
could
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comment
donc
,
he
shares
her
with
YOU
?
''
she
exclaimed
in
droll
*NL*
stupefaction
.
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
have
,
before
you
go
much
further
,
*NL*
rather
more
of
all
ces
dames
than
you
may
know
what
to
do
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
only
continued
in
his
massive
way
.
``
I
can
post
you
about
the
*NL*
lady
,
Mrs.
Pocock
,
so
far
as
you
may
care
to
hear
.
I
've
seen
her
quite
*NL*
a
number
of
times
,
and
I
was
practically
present
when
they
made
*NL*
acquaintance
.
I
've
kept
my
eye
on
her
right
along
,
but
I
do
n't
know
as
*NL*
there
's
any
real
harm
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Harm
'
?
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
quickly
echoed
.
``
Why
she
's
the
dearest
and
*NL*
cleverest
of
all
the
clever
and
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
run
her
pretty
close
,
Countess
,
''
Waymarsh
returned
with
*NL*
spirit
;
``
though
there
's
no
doubt
she
's
pretty
well
up
in
things
.
She
*NL*
knows
her
way
round
Europe
.
Above
all
there
's
no
doubt
she
does
love
*NL*
Strether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
we
all
do
that
--
we
all
love
Strether
:
it
is
n't
a
merit
!
''
their
*NL*
fellow
visitor
laughed
,
keeping
to
her
idea
with
a
good
conscience
at
*NL*
which
our
friend
was
aware
that
he
marvelled
,
though
he
trusted
also
*NL*
for
it
,
as
he
met
her
exquisitely
expressive
eyes
,
to
some
later
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prime
effect
of
her
tone
,
however
--
and
it
was
a
truth
which
his
own
*NL*
eyes
gave
back
to
her
in
sad
ironic
play
--
could
only
be
to
make
him
*NL*
feel
that
,
to
say
such
things
to
a
man
in
public
,
a
woman
must
*NL*
practically
think
of
him
as
ninety
years
old
.
He
had
turned
awkwardly
,
*NL*
responsively
red
,
he
knew
,
at
her
mention
of
Maria
Gostrey
;
Sarah
*NL*
Pocock
's
presence
--
the
particular
quality
of
it
--
had
made
this
*NL*
inevitable
;
and
then
he
had
grown
still
redder
in
proportion
as
he
*NL*
hated
to
have
shown
anything
at
all
.
He
felt
indeed
that
he
was
*NL*
showing
much
,
as
,
uncomfortably
and
almost
in
pain
,
he
offered
up
his
*NL*
redness
to
Waymarsh
,
who
,
strangely
enough
,
seemed
now
to
be
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
a
certain
explanatory
yearning
.
Something
deep
--
something
*NL*
built
on
their
old
old
relation
--
passed
,
in
this
complexity
,
between
*NL*
them
;
he
got
the
side-wind
of
a
loyalty
that
stood
behind
all
actual
*NL*
queer
questions
.
Waymarsh
's
dry
bare
humour
--
as
it
gave
itself
to
be
*NL*
taken
--
gloomed
out
to
demand
justice
.
``
Well
,
if
you
talk
of
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
I
've
MY
chance
too
,
''
it
appeared
stiffly
to
nod
,
and
it
granted
*NL*
that
it
was
giving
him
away
,
but
struggled
to
add
that
it
did
so
only
*NL*
to
save
him
.
The
sombre
glow
stared
it
at
him
till
it
fairly
sounded
*NL*
out
--
``
to
save
you
,
poor
old
man
,
to
save
you
;
to
save
you
in
spite
of
*NL*
yourself
.
''
Yet
it
was
somehow
just
this
communication
that
showed
him
*NL*
to
himself
as
more
than
ever
lost
.
Still
another
result
of
it
was
to
*NL*
put
before
him
as
never
yet
that
between
his
comrade
and
the
interest
*NL*
represented
by
Sarah
there
was
already
a
basis
.
Beyond
all
question
*NL*
now
,
yes
:
Waymarsh
had
been
in
occult
relation
with
Mrs.
Newsome
--
out
,
*NL*
out
it
all
came
in
the
very
effort
of
his
face
.
``
Yes
,
you
're
feeling
*NL*
my
hand
''
--
he
as
good
as
proclaimed
it
;
``
but
only
because
this
at
least
*NL*
I
SHALL
have
got
out
of
the
damned
Old
World
:
that
I
shall
have
picked
*NL*
up
the
pieces
into
which
it
has
caused
you
to
crumble
.
''
It
was
as
if
in
*NL*
short
,
after
an
instant
,
Strether
had
not
only
had
it
from
him
,
but
had
*NL*
recognised
that
so
far
as
this
went
the
instant
had
cleared
the
air
.
*NL*
Our
friend
understood
and
approved
;
he
had
the
sense
that
they
would
n't
*NL*
otherwise
speak
of
it
.
This
would
be
all
,
and
it
would
mark
in
himself
*NL*
a
kind
of
intelligent
generosity
.
It
was
with
grim
Sarah
then
--
Sarah
*NL*
grim
for
all
her
grace
--
that
Waymarsh
had
begun
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
save
him
.
Well
--
if
he
COULD
,
poor
dear
man
,
with
his
big
*NL*
bleak
kindness
!
The
upshot
of
which
crowded
perception
was
that
*NL*
Strether
,
on
his
own
side
,
still
showed
no
more
than
he
absolutely
had
*NL*
to
.
He
showed
the
least
possible
by
saying
to
Mrs.
Pocock
after
an
*NL*
interval
much
briefer
than
our
glance
at
the
picture
reflected
in
him
:
*NL*
``
Oh
it
's
as
true
as
they
please
!
--
There
's
no
Miss
Gostrey
for
any
one
*NL*
but
me
--
not
the
least
little
peep
.
I
keep
her
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
very
good
of
you
to
notify
me
,
''
Sarah
replied
without
*NL*
looking
at
him
and
thrown
for
a
moment
by
this
discrimination
,
as
the
*NL*
direction
of
her
eyes
showed
,
upon
a
dimly
desperate
little
community
*NL*
with
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
``
But
I
hope
I
sha
n't
miss
her
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
instantly
rallied
.
``
And
you
know
--
though
it
might
*NL*
occur
to
one
--
it
is
n't
in
the
least
that
he
's
ashamed
of
her
.
She
's
*NL*
really
--
in
a
way
--
extremely
good-looking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
extremely
!
''
Strether
laughed
while
he
wondered
at
the
odd
part
*NL*
he
found
thus
imposed
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
continued
to
be
so
by
every
touch
from
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
``
Well
,
as
*NL*
I
say
,
you
know
,
I
wish
you
would
keep
ME
a
little
more
to
yourself
.
*NL*
Could
n't
you
name
some
day
for
me
,
some
hour
--
and
better
soon
than
*NL*
late
?
I
'll
be
at
home
whenever
it
best
suits
you
.
There
--
I
ca
n't
say
*NL*
fairer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
a
moment
while
Waymarsh
and
Mrs.
Pocock
affected
him
*NL*
as
standing
attentive
.
``
I
did
lately
call
on
you
.
Last
week
--
while
*NL*
Chad
was
out
of
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
and
I
was
away
,
as
it
happened
,
too
.
You
choose
your
moments
*NL*
well
.
But
do
n't
wait
for
my
next
absence
,
for
I
sha
n't
make
another
,
''
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
declared
,
``
while
Mrs.
Pocock
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
vow
need
n't
keep
you
long
,
fortunately
,
''
Sarah
observed
with
*NL*
reasserted
suavity
.
``
I
shall
be
at
present
but
a
short
time
in
Paris
.
*NL*
I
have
my
plans
for
other
countries
.
I
meet
a
number
of
charming
*NL*
friends
''
--
and
her
voice
seemed
to
caress
that
description
of
these
*NL*
persons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
her
visitor
cheerfully
replied
,
``
all
the
more
reason
!
*NL*
To-morrow
,
for
instance
,
or
next
day
?
''
she
continued
to
Strether
.
*NL*
``
Tuesday
would
do
for
me
beautifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tuesday
then
with
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
at
half-past
five
?
--
or
at
six
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
ridiculous
,
but
Mrs.
Pocock
and
Waymarsh
struck
him
as
fairly
*NL*
waiting
for
his
answer
.
It
was
indeed
as
if
they
were
arranged
,
*NL*
gathered
for
a
performance
,
the
performance
of
``
Europe
''
by
his
*NL*
confederate
and
himself
.
Well
,
the
performance
could
only
go
on
.
``
Say
*NL*
five
forty-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
forty-five
--
good
.
''
And
now
at
last
Madame
de
Vionnet
must
leave
*NL*
them
,
though
it
carried
,
for
herself
,
the
performance
a
little
further
.
*NL*
``
I
DID
hope
so
much
also
to
see
Miss
Pocock
.
May
n't
I
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sarah
hesitated
,
but
she
rose
equal
.
``
She
'll
return
your
visit
with
*NL*
me
.
She
's
at
present
out
with
Mr.
Pocock
and
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
of
course
Mr.
Newsome
has
everything
to
show
them
.
He
has
told
*NL*
me
so
much
about
her
.
My
great
desire
's
to
give
my
daughter
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
her
acquaintance
.
I
'm
always
on
the
lookout
for
*NL*
such
chances
for
her
.
If
I
did
n't
bring
her
to-day
it
was
only
to
make
*NL*
sure
first
that
you
'd
let
me
.
''
After
which
the
charming
woman
risked
a
*NL*
more
intense
appeal
.
``
It
would
n't
suit
you
also
to
mention
some
near
*NL*
time
,
so
that
we
shall
be
sure
not
to
lose
you
?
''
Strether
on
his
side
*NL*
waited
,
for
Sarah
likewise
had
,
after
all
,
to
perform
;
and
it
occupied
*NL*
him
to
have
been
thus
reminded
that
she
had
stayed
at
home
--
and
on
her
*NL*
first
morning
of
Paris
--
while
Chad
led
the
others
forth
.
Oh
she
was
up
*NL*
to
her
eyes
;
if
she
had
stayed
at
home
she
had
stayed
by
an
*NL*
understanding
,
arrived
at
the
evening
before
,
that
Waymarsh
would
come
*NL*
and
find
her
alone
.
This
was
beginning
well
--
for
a
first
day
in
Paris
;
*NL*
and
the
thing
might
be
amusing
yet
.
But
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
*NL*
earnestness
was
meanwhile
beautiful
.
``
You
may
think
me
indiscreet
,
but
*NL*
I
've
SUCH
a
desire
my
Jeanne
shall
know
an
American
girl
of
the
really
*NL*
delightful
kind
.
You
see
I
throw
myself
for
it
on
your
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
of
this
speech
gave
Strether
such
a
sense
of
depths
below
it
*NL*
and
behind
it
as
he
had
n't
yet
had
--
ministered
in
a
way
that
almost
*NL*
frightened
him
to
his
dim
divinations
of
reasons
;
but
if
Sarah
still
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
it
,
faltered
,
this
was
why
he
had
time
for
a
sign
of
*NL*
sympathy
with
her
petitioner
.
``
Let
me
say
then
,
dear
lady
,
to
back
*NL*
your
plea
,
that
Miss
Mamie
is
of
the
most
delightful
kind
of
all
--
is
*NL*
charming
among
the
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Waymarsh
,
though
with
more
to
produce
on
the
subject
,
could
get
*NL*
into
motion
in
time
.
``
Yes
,
Countess
,
the
American
girl
's
a
thing
that
*NL*
your
country
must
at
least
allow
ours
the
privilege
to
say
we
CAN
show
*NL*
you
.
But
her
full
beauty
is
only
for
those
who
know
how
to
make
use
of
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
smiled
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
``
that
's
exactly
what
I
want
to
do
.
*NL*
I
'm
sure
she
has
much
to
teach
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
wonderful
,
but
what
was
scarce
less
so
was
that
Strether
found
*NL*
himself
,
by
the
quick
effect
of
it
,
moved
another
way
.
``
Oh
that
may
*NL*
be
!
But
do
n't
speak
of
your
own
exquisite
daughter
,
you
know
,
as
if
*NL*
she
were
n't
pure
perfection
.
I
at
least
wo
n't
take
that
from
you
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet
,
''
he
explained
,
in
considerable
form
,
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
,
``
IS
pure
perfection
.
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet
IS
exquisite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
perhaps
a
little
portentous
,
but
``
Ah
?
''
Sarah
simply
*NL*
glittered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
himself
,
for
that
matter
,
apparently
recognised
,
in
respect
to
*NL*
the
facts
,
the
need
of
a
larger
justice
,
and
he
had
with
it
an
*NL*
inclination
to
Sarah
.
``
Miss
Jane
's
strikingly
handsome
--
in
the
regular
*NL*
French
style
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
somehow
made
both
Strether
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
laugh
out
,
though
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
he
caught
in
Sarah
's
eyes
,
as
glancing
at
the
*NL*
speaker
,
a
vague
but
unmistakeable
``
You
too
?
''
It
made
Waymarsh
in
fact
*NL*
look
consciously
over
her
head
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
meanwhile
,
however
,
*NL*
made
her
point
in
her
own
way
.
``
I
wish
indeed
I
could
offer
you
my
*NL*
poor
child
as
a
dazzling
attraction
:
it
would
make
one
's
position
*NL*
simple
enough
!
She
's
as
good
as
she
can
be
,
but
of
course
she
's
*NL*
different
,
and
the
question
is
now
--
in
the
light
of
the
way
things
seem
*NL*
to
go
--
if
she
is
n't
after
all
TOO
different
:
too
different
I
mean
from
*NL*
the
splendid
type
every
one
is
so
agreed
that
your
wonderful
country
*NL*
produces
.
On
the
other
hand
of
course
Mr.
Newsome
,
who
knows
it
so
*NL*
well
,
has
,
as
a
good
friend
,
dear
kind
man
that
he
is
,
done
everything
*NL*
he
can
--
to
keep
us
from
fatal
benightedness
--
for
my
small
shy
creature
.
*NL*
Well
,
''
she
wound
up
after
Mrs.
Pocock
had
signified
,
in
a
murmur
still
*NL*
a
little
stiff
,
that
she
would
speak
to
her
own
young
charge
on
the
*NL*
question
--
``
well
,
we
shall
sit
,
my
child
and
I
,
and
wait
and
wait
and
*NL*
wait
for
you
.
''
But
her
last
fine
turn
was
for
Strether
.
``
Do
speak
of
*NL*
us
in
such
a
way
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
that
something
ca
n't
but
come
of
it
?
Oh
something
SHALL
come
of
*NL*
it
!
I
take
a
great
interest
!
''
he
further
declared
;
and
in
proof
of
it
,
*NL*
the
next
moment
,
he
had
gone
with
her
down
to
her
carriage
.

``
The
difficulty
is
,
''
Strether
said
to
Madame
de
Vionnet
a
couple
of
*NL*
days
later
,
``
that
I
ca
n't
surprise
them
into
the
smallest
sign
of
his
*NL*
not
being
the
same
old
Chad
they
've
been
for
the
last
three
years
*NL*
glowering
at
across
the
sea
.
They
simply
wo
n't
give
any
,
and
as
a
*NL*
policy
,
you
know
--
what
you
call
a
parti
pris
,
a
deep
game
--
that
's
*NL*
positively
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
remarkable
that
our
friend
had
pulled
up
before
his
hostess
*NL*
with
the
vision
of
it
;
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
at
the
end
of
ten
*NL*
minutes
and
begun
,
as
a
help
not
to
worry
,
to
move
about
before
her
*NL*
quite
as
he
moved
before
Maria
.
He
had
kept
his
appointment
with
her
*NL*
to
the
minute
and
had
been
intensely
impatient
,
though
divided
in
truth
*NL*
between
the
sense
of
having
everything
to
tell
her
and
the
sense
of
*NL*
having
nothing
at
all
.
The
short
interval
had
,
in
the
face
of
their
*NL*
complication
,
multiplied
his
impressions
--
it
being
meanwhile
to
be
*NL*
noted
,
moreover
,
that
he
already
frankly
,
already
almost
publicly
,
*NL*
viewed
the
complication
as
common
to
them
.
If
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
under
*NL*
Sarah
's
eyes
,
had
pulled
him
into
her
boat
,
there
was
by
this
time
no
*NL*
doubt
whatever
that
he
had
remained
in
it
and
that
what
he
had
really
*NL*
most
been
conscious
of
for
many
hours
together
was
the
movement
of
the
*NL*
vessel
itself
.
They
were
in
it
together
this
moment
as
they
had
n't
yet
*NL*
been
,
and
he
had
n't
at
present
uttered
the
least
of
the
words
of
alarm
*NL*
or
remonstrance
that
had
died
on
his
lips
at
the
hotel
.
He
had
other
*NL*
things
to
say
to
her
than
that
she
had
put
him
in
a
position
;
so
*NL*
quickly
had
his
position
grown
to
affect
him
as
quite
excitingly
,
*NL*
altogether
richly
,
inevitable
.
That
the
outlook
,
however
--
given
the
*NL*
point
of
exposure
--
had
n't
cleared
up
half
so
much
as
he
had
reckoned
*NL*
was
the
first
warning
she
received
from
him
on
his
arrival
.
She
had
*NL*
replied
with
indulgence
that
he
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
,
and
had
*NL*
remarked
soothingly
that
if
she
knew
how
to
be
patient
surely
HE
might
*NL*
be
.
He
felt
her
presence
,
on
the
spot
,
he
felt
her
tone
and
everything
*NL*
about
her
,
as
an
aid
to
that
effort
;
and
it
was
perhaps
one
of
the
*NL*
proofs
of
her
success
with
him
that
he
seemed
so
much
to
take
his
ease
*NL*
while
they
talked
.
By
the
time
he
had
explained
to
her
why
his
*NL*
impressions
,
though
multiplied
,
still
baffled
him
,
it
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
been
familiarly
talking
for
hours
.
They
baffled
him
because
*NL*
Sarah
--
well
,
Sarah
was
deep
,
deeper
than
she
had
ever
yet
had
a
chance
*NL*
to
show
herself
.
He
did
n't
say
that
this
was
partly
the
effect
of
her
*NL*
opening
so
straight
down
,
as
it
were
,
into
her
mother
,
and
that
,
given
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
's
profundity
,
the
shaft
thus
sunk
might
well
have
a
reach
;
*NL*
but
he
was
n't
without
a
resigned
apprehension
that
,
at
such
a
rate
of
*NL*
confidence
between
the
two
women
,
he
was
likely
soon
to
be
moved
to
*NL*
show
how
already
,
at
moments
,
it
had
been
for
him
as
if
he
were
dealing
*NL*
directly
with
Mrs.
Newsome
.
Sarah
,
to
a
certainty
,
would
have
begun
*NL*
herself
to
feel
it
in
him
--
and
this
naturally
put
it
in
her
power
to
*NL*
torment
him
the
more
.
From
the
moment
she
knew
he
COULD
be
tormented
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
WHY
can
you
be
?
''
--
his
companion
was
surprised
at
his
use
of
the
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
made
so
--
I
think
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
one
must
never
do
that
,
''
she
smiled
.
``
One
must
think
of
as
few
*NL*
things
as
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
he
answered
,
``
one
must
pick
them
out
right
.
But
all
I
mean
*NL*
is
--
for
I
express
myself
with
violence
--
that
she
's
in
a
position
to
*NL*
watch
me
.
There
's
an
element
of
suspense
for
me
,
and
she
can
see
me
*NL*
wriggle
.
But
my
wriggling
does
n't
matter
,
''
he
pursued
.
``
I
can
bear
*NL*
it
.
Besides
,
I
shall
wriggle
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture
at
any
rate
stirred
in
her
an
appreciation
that
he
felt
to
*NL*
be
sincere
.
``
I
do
n't
see
how
a
man
can
be
kinder
to
a
woman
than
you
*NL*
are
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
kind
was
what
he
wanted
to
be
;
yet
even
while
her
charming
eyes
*NL*
rested
on
him
with
the
truth
of
this
he
none
the
less
had
his
humour
of
*NL*
honesty
.
``
When
I
say
suspense
I
mean
,
you
know
,
''
he
laughed
,
``
suspense
*NL*
about
my
own
case
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
about
your
own
case
too
!
''
It
diminished
his
magnanimity
,
but
*NL*
she
only
looked
at
him
the
more
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
,
however
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
I
want
to
talk
to
you
about
that
.
*NL*
It
's
my
own
little
affair
,
and
I
mentioned
it
simply
as
part
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
's
advantage
.
''
No
,
no
;
though
there
was
a
queer
present
*NL*
temptation
in
it
,
and
his
suspense
was
so
real
that
to
fidget
was
a
*NL*
relief
,
he
would
n't
talk
to
her
about
Mrs.
Newsome
,
would
n't
work
off
*NL*
on
her
the
anxiety
produced
in
him
by
Sarah
's
calculated
omissions
of
*NL*
reference
.
The
effect
she
produced
of
representing
her
mother
had
been
*NL*
produced
--
and
that
was
just
the
immense
,
the
uncanny
part
of
*NL*
it
--
without
her
having
so
much
as
mentioned
that
lady
.
She
had
brought
*NL*
no
message
,
had
alluded
to
no
question
,
had
only
answered
his
enquiries
*NL*
with
hopeless
limited
propriety
.
She
had
invented
a
way
of
meeting
*NL*
them
--
as
if
he
had
been
a
polite
perfunctory
poor
relation
,
of
distant
*NL*
degree
--
that
made
them
almost
ridiculous
in
him
.
He
could
n't
moreover
*NL*
on
his
own
side
ask
much
without
appearing
to
publish
how
he
had
lately
*NL*
lacked
news
;
a
circumstance
of
which
it
was
Sarah
's
profound
policy
not
*NL*
to
betray
a
suspicion
.
These
things
,
all
the
same
,
he
would
n't
breathe
*NL*
to
Madame
de
Vionnet
--
much
as
they
might
make
him
walk
up
and
down
.
And
*NL*
what
he
did
n't
say
--
as
well
as
what
SHE
did
n't
,
for
she
had
also
her
*NL*
high
decencies
--
enhanced
the
effect
of
his
being
there
with
her
at
the
*NL*
end
of
ten
minutes
more
intimately
on
the
basis
of
saving
her
than
he
*NL*
had
yet
had
occasion
to
be
.
It
ended
in
fact
by
being
quite
beautiful
*NL*
between
them
,
the
number
of
things
they
had
a
manifest
consciousness
of
*NL*
not
saying
.
He
would
have
liked
to
turn
her
,
critically
,
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
Mrs.
Pocock
,
but
he
so
stuck
to
the
line
he
felt
to
be
the
*NL*
point
of
honour
and
of
delicacy
that
he
scarce
even
asked
her
what
her
*NL*
personal
impression
had
been
.
He
knew
it
,
for
that
matter
,
without
*NL*
putting
her
to
trouble
:
that
she
wondered
how
,
with
such
elements
,
*NL*
Sarah
could
still
have
no
charm
,
was
one
of
the
principal
things
she
*NL*
held
her
tongue
about
.
Strether
would
have
been
interested
in
her
*NL*
estimate
of
the
elements
--
indubitably
there
,
some
of
them
,
and
to
be
*NL*
appraised
according
to
taste
--
but
he
denied
himself
even
the
luxury
of
*NL*
this
diversion
.
The
way
Madame
de
Vionnet
affected
him
to-day
was
in
*NL*
itself
a
kind
of
demonstration
of
the
happy
employment
of
gifts
.
How
*NL*
could
a
woman
think
Sarah
had
charm
who
struck
one
as
having
arrived
at
*NL*
it
herself
by
such
different
roads
?
On
the
other
hand
of
course
Sarah
*NL*
was
n't
obliged
to
have
it
.
He
felt
as
if
somehow
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
WAS
.
The
great
question
meanwhile
was
what
Chad
thought
of
his
sister
;
*NL*
which
was
naturally
ushered
in
by
that
of
Sarah
's
apprehension
of
Chad
.
*NL*
THAT
they
could
talk
of
,
and
with
a
freedom
purchased
by
their
*NL*
discretion
in
other
senses
.
The
difficulty
however
was
that
they
were
*NL*
reduced
as
yet
to
conjecture
.
He
had
given
them
in
the
day
or
two
as
*NL*
little
of
a
lead
as
Sarah
,
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
mentioned
that
she
*NL*
had
n't
seen
him
since
his
sister
's
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
that
strike
you
as
such
an
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
it
in
all
honesty
.
``
Oh
I
wo
n't
pretend
I
do
n't
miss
him
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
see
him
every
day
.
Our
friendship
's
like
that
.
Make
what
*NL*
you
will
of
it
!
''
she
whimsically
smiled
;
a
little
flicker
of
the
kind
,
*NL*
occasional
in
her
,
that
had
more
than
once
moved
him
to
wonder
what
he
*NL*
might
best
make
of
HER
.
``
But
he
's
perfectly
right
,
''
she
hastened
to
*NL*
add
,
``
and
I
would
n't
have
him
fail
in
any
way
at
present
for
the
world
.
*NL*
I
'd
sooner
not
see
him
for
three
months
.
I
begged
him
to
be
beautiful
*NL*
to
them
,
and
he
fully
feels
it
for
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
turned
away
under
his
quick
perception
;
she
was
so
odd
a
*NL*
mixture
of
lucidity
and
mystery
.
She
fell
in
at
moments
with
the
*NL*
theory
about
her
he
most
cherished
,
and
she
seemed
at
others
to
blow
it
*NL*
into
air
.
She
spoke
now
as
if
her
art
were
all
an
innocence
,
and
then
*NL*
again
as
if
her
innocence
were
all
an
art
.
``
Oh
he
's
giving
himself
up
,
*NL*
and
he
'll
do
so
to
the
end
.
How
can
he
but
want
,
now
that
it
's
within
*NL*
reach
,
his
full
impression
?
--
which
is
much
more
important
,
you
know
,
*NL*
than
either
yours
or
mine
.
But
he
's
just
soaking
,
''
Strether
said
as
he
*NL*
came
back
;
``
he
's
going
in
conscientiously
for
a
saturation
.
I
'm
bound
*NL*
to
say
he
IS
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
she
quietly
replied
,
``
to
whom
do
you
say
it
?
''
And
then
more
*NL*
quietly
still
:
``
He
's
capable
of
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
more
than
reaffirmed
--
``
Oh
he
's
excellent
.
I
more
and
more
*NL*
like
,
''
he
insisted
,
``
to
see
him
with
them
;
''
though
the
oddity
of
this
*NL*
tone
between
them
grew
sharper
for
him
even
while
they
spoke
.
It
placed
*NL*
the
young
man
so
before
them
as
the
result
of
her
interest
and
the
*NL*
product
of
her
genius
,
acknowledged
so
her
part
in
the
phenomenon
and
*NL*
made
the
phenomenon
so
rare
,
that
more
than
ever
yet
he
might
have
been
*NL*
on
the
very
point
of
asking
her
for
some
more
detailed
account
of
the
*NL*
whole
business
than
he
had
yet
received
from
her
.
The
occasion
almost
*NL*
forced
upon
him
some
question
as
to
how
she
had
managed
and
as
to
the
*NL*
appearance
such
miracles
presented
from
her
own
singularly
close
place
*NL*
of
survey
.
The
moment
in
fact
however
passed
,
giving
way
to
more
*NL*
present
history
,
and
he
continued
simply
to
mark
his
appreciation
of
*NL*
the
happy
truth
.
``
It
's
a
tremendous
comfort
to
feel
how
one
can
trust
*NL*
him
.
''
And
then
again
while
for
a
little
she
said
nothing
--
as
if
after
*NL*
all
to
HER
trust
there
might
be
a
special
limit
:
``
I
mean
for
making
a
*NL*
good
show
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
thoughtfully
returned
--
``
but
if
they
shut
their
eyes
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
for
an
instant
had
his
own
thought
.
``
Well
perhaps
that
wo
n't
*NL*
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
because
he
probably
--
do
what
they
will
--
wo
n't
like
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
`
do
what
they
will
'
--
!
They
wo
n't
do
much
;
especially
if
Sarah
*NL*
has
n't
more
--
well
,
more
than
one
has
yet
made
out
--
to
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
weighed
it
.
``
Ah
she
has
all
her
grace
!
''
It
was
a
*NL*
statement
over
which
,
for
a
little
,
they
could
look
at
each
other
*NL*
sufficiently
straight
,
and
though
it
produced
no
protest
from
Strether
*NL*
the
effect
was
somehow
as
if
he
had
treated
it
as
a
joke
.
``
She
may
be
*NL*
persuasive
and
caressing
with
him
;
she
may
be
eloquent
beyond
words
.
*NL*
She
may
get
hold
of
him
,
''
she
wound
up
--
``
well
,
as
neither
you
nor
I
*NL*
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
MAY
''
--
and
now
Strether
smiled
.
``
But
he
has
spent
all
his
*NL*
time
each
day
with
Jim
.
He
's
still
showing
Jim
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
visibly
wondered
.
``
Then
how
about
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
a
turn
before
he
answered
.
``
Has
n't
he
given
you
Jim
?
*NL*
Has
n't
he
before
this
`
done
'
him
for
you
?
''
He
was
a
little
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
``
Does
n't
he
tell
you
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
.
``
No
''
--
and
their
eyes
once
more
gave
and
took
.
``
Not
as
*NL*
you
do
.
You
somehow
make
me
see
them
--
or
at
least
feel
them
.
And
I
*NL*
have
n't
asked
too
much
,
''
she
added
;
``
I
've
of
late
wanted
so
not
to
*NL*
worry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
for
that
,
so
have
I
,
''
he
said
with
encouraging
assent
;
so
that
--
as
*NL*
if
she
had
answered
everything
--
they
were
briefly
sociable
on
it
.
It
*NL*
threw
him
back
on
his
other
thought
,
with
which
he
took
another
turn
;
*NL*
stopping
again
,
however
,
presently
with
something
of
a
glow
.
``
You
see
*NL*
Jim
's
really
immense
.
I
think
it
will
be
Jim
who
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
Get
hold
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
just
the
other
thing
.
Counteract
Sarah
's
spell
.
''
And
he
showed
*NL*
now
,
our
friend
,
how
far
he
had
worked
it
out
.
``
Jim
's
intensely
*NL*
cynical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
Jim
!
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
vaguely
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
literally
--
dear
Jim
!
He
's
awful
.
What
HE
wants
,
heaven
forgive
*NL*
him
,
is
to
help
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
''
--
she
was
eager
--
``
help
ME
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Chad
and
me
in
the
first
place
.
But
he
throws
you
in
too
,
*NL*
though
without
as
yet
seeing
you
much
.
Only
,
so
far
as
he
does
see
*NL*
you
--
if
you
do
n't
mind
--
he
sees
you
as
awful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Awful
'
?
''
--
she
wanted
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
regular
bad
one
--
though
of
course
of
a
tremendously
superior
kind

*NL*
Dreadful
,
delightful
,
irresistible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
dear
Jim
!
I
should
like
to
know
him
.
I
MUST
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
naturally
.
But
will
it
do
?
You
may
,
you
know
,
''
Strether
*NL*
suggested
,
``
disappoint
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
droll
and
humble
about
it
.
``
I
can
but
try
.
But
my
wickedness
*NL*
then
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
is
my
recommendation
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wickedness
and
the
charms
with
which
,
in
such
a
degree
as
yours
,
*NL*
he
associates
it
.
He
understands
,
you
see
,
that
Chad
and
I
have
above
*NL*
all
wanted
to
have
a
good
time
,
and
his
view
is
simple
and
sharp
.
*NL*
Nothing
will
persuade
him
--
in
the
light
,
that
is
,
of
my
behaviour
--
that
*NL*
I
really
did
n't
,
quite
as
much
as
Chad
,
come
over
to
have
one
before
it
*NL*
was
too
late
.
He
would
n't
have
expected
it
of
me
;
but
men
of
my
age
,
*NL*
at
Woollett
--
and
especially
the
least
likely
ones
--
have
been
noted
as
*NL*
liable
to
strange
outbreaks
,
belated
uncanny
clutches
at
the
unusual
,
*NL*
the
ideal
.
It
's
an
effect
that
a
lifetime
of
Woollett
has
quite
been
*NL*
observed
as
having
;
and
I
thus
give
it
to
you
,
in
Jim
's
view
,
for
what
*NL*
it
's
worth
.
Now
his
wife
and
his
mother-in-law
,
''
Strether
continued
to
*NL*
explain
,
``
have
,
as
in
honour
bound
,
no
patience
with
such
phenomena
,
*NL*
late
or
early
--
which
puts
Jim
,
as
against
his
relatives
,
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
Besides
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
do
n't
think
he
really
wants
Chad
back
.
If
*NL*
Chad
does
n't
come
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
have
''
--
Madame
de
Vionnet
quite
apprehended
--
``
more
of
the
free
*NL*
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Chad
's
the
bigger
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
'll
work
now
,
en
dessous
,
to
keep
him
quiet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
he
wo
n't
`
work

at
all
,
and
he
wo
n't
do
anything
en
dessous

He
's
*NL*
very
decent
and
wo
n't
be
a
traitor
in
the
camp
.
But
he
'll
be
amused
*NL*
with
his
own
little
view
of
our
duplicity
,
he
'll
sniff
up
what
he
*NL*
supposes
to
be
Paris
from
morning
till
night
,
and
he
'll
be
,
as
to
the
*NL*
rest
,
for
Chad
--
well
,
just
what
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
it
over
.
``
A
warning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
it
almost
with
glee
.
``
You
ARE
as
wonderful
as
everybody
says
!
''
*NL*
And
then
to
explain
all
he
meant
:
``
I
drove
him
about
for
his
first
*NL*
hour
,
and
do
you
know
what
--
all
beautifully
unconscious
--
he
most
put
*NL*
before
me
?
Why
that
something
like
THAT
is
at
bottom
,
as
an
*NL*
improvement
to
his
present
state
,
as
in
fact
the
real
redemption
of
it
,
*NL*
what
they
think
it
may
not
be
too
late
to
make
of
our
friend
.
''
With
*NL*
which
,
as
,
taking
it
in
,
she
seemed
,
in
her
recurrent
alarm
,
bravely
to
*NL*
gaze
at
the
possibility
,
he
completed
his
statement
.
``
But
it
IS
too
*NL*
late
.
Thanks
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
drew
from
her
again
one
of
her
indefinite
reflexions
.
``
Oh
*NL*
`
me
'
--
after
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
before
her
so
exhilarated
by
his
demonstration
that
he
could
*NL*
fairly
be
jocular
.
``
Everything
's
comparative
.
You
're
better
than
*NL*
THAT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
''
--
she
could
but
answer
him
--
``
are
better
than
anything
.
''
But
she
*NL*
had
another
thought
.
``
WILL
Mrs.
Pocock
come
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
she
'll
do
that
.
As
soon
,
that
is
,
as
my
friend
Waymarsh
--
HER
*NL*
friend
now
--
leaves
her
leisure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
an
interest
.
``
Is
he
so
much
her
friend
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
n't
you
see
it
all
at
the
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
''
--
she
was
amused
--
''
`
all
'
is
a
good
deal
to
say
.
I
do
n't
know
--
I
*NL*
forget
.
I
lost
myself
in
HER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
splendid
,
''
Strether
returned
--
``
but
`
all
'
is
n't
a
good
deal
to
*NL*
say
:
it
's
only
a
little
.
Yet
it
's
charming
so
far
as
it
goes
.
She
*NL*
wants
a
man
to
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
n't
she
got
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
she
looked
at
me
--
or
even
at
you
--
as
if
she
had
?
''
*NL*
Strether
easily
dismissed
that
irony
.
``
Every
one
,
you
see
,
must
strike
*NL*
her
as
having
somebody
.
You
've
got
Chad
--
and
Chad
has
got
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
''
--
she
made
of
it
what
she
could
.
``
And
you
've
got
Maria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
on
his
side
accepted
that
.
``
I
've
got
Maria
.
And
Maria
has
*NL*
got
me
.
So
it
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Jim
--
whom
has
he
got
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
he
has
got
--
or
it
's
as
IF
he
had
--
the
whole
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
Mr.
Waymarsh
''
--
she
recalled
--
``
is
n't
Miss
Barrace
before
any
*NL*
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Miss
Barrace
is
a
raffinee
,
and
her
amusement
*NL*
wo
n't
lose
by
Mrs.
Pocock
.
It
will
gain
rather
--
especially
if
Sarah
*NL*
triumphs
and
she
comes
in
for
a
view
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
you
know
us
!
''
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
at
this
,
frankly
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
it
seems
to
me
it
's
we
that
I
know
.
I
know
Sarah
--
it
's
perhaps
on
*NL*
that
ground
only
that
my
feet
are
firm
.
Waymarsh
will
take
her
round
*NL*
while
Chad
takes
Jim
--
and
I
shall
be
,
I
assure
you
delighted
for
both
*NL*
of
them
.
Sarah
will
have
had
what
she
requires
--
she
will
have
paid
her
*NL*
tribute
to
the
ideal
;
and
he
will
have
done
about
the
same
.
In
Paris
*NL*
it
's
in
the
air
--
so
what
can
one
do
less
?
If
there
's
a
point
that
,
*NL*
beyond
any
other
,
Sarah
wants
to
make
,
it
's
that
she
did
n't
come
out
to
*NL*
be
narrow
.
We
shall
feel
at
least
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
sighed
,
``
the
quantity
we
seem
likely
to
`
feel
'
!
But
what
*NL*
becomes
,
in
these
conditions
,
of
the
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
Mamie

if
we
're
all
provided
?
Ah
for
that
,

said
Strether
,
``
you
*NL*
can
trust
Chad

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be

you
mean

all
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
pay
her
every
attention

soon

off

wants
what

him

what
Jim
really
wo

though
he
has
*NL*
had
it
all

and
more
than
all

He
wants
in
short
his
own
*NL*
personal
impression
,
and
he
'll
get
it

strong
.
But
as
soon
as
he
has

got
it
Mamie
wo
n't
suffer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Mamie
must
n't
SUFFER

Madame
de
Vionnet
soothingly
emphasised
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Strether
could
reassure
her
.
``
Do
n't
fear

As
soon
as

done
*NL*
with
Jim

Jim
will
fall
to

And
then
you
'll
see

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
in
a
moment
she
saw
already
;
yet
she
still
waited
.
Then
*NL*
``
Is
she
really
quite
charming
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
got
up
with
his
last
words
and
gathered
in
his
hat
and
gloves
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

I
'm
watching

I
'm
studying
the

I
*NL*
dare
say
I
shall
be
able

tell
you

*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered

``
Is
it
a
case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think
so

*NL*
``

n't
you
known
her
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
smiled

``

somehow
at
home
she
was
n't
a
case

She
has
*NL*
become
one
since

It
was
as
if
he
made
it
out
for
himself
.
``
She
has
*NL*
become
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
very
very
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
measured
it
,
laughing
.
``
Not
sooner
than
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
became
one
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
very
soon
.
The
day
I
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
intelligent
eyes
showed
her
thought
of
it
.
``
Ah
but
the
day
you
*NL*
arrived
you
met
Maria
.
Whom
has
Miss
Pocock
met
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
again
,
but
he
brought
it
out
.
``
Has
n't
she
met
Chad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
--
but
not
for
the
first
time
.
He
's
an
old
friend
.
''
At
which
*NL*
Strether
had
a
slow
amused
significant
headshake
that
made
her
go
on
:
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
for
HER
at
least
he
's
a
new
person
--
that
she
sees
him
as
*NL*
different
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
sees
him
as
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
does
she
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
gave
it
up
.
``
How
can
one
tell
how
a
deep
little
girl
sees
a
*NL*
deep
young
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
every
one
so
deep
?
Is
she
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
strikes
me
deeper
than
I
thought
.
But
wait
a
little
--
between
us
*NL*
we
'll
make
it
out
.
You
'll
judge
for
that
matter
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
looked
for
the
moment
fairly
bent
on
the
chance
.
*NL*
``
Then
she
WILL
come
with
her
?
--
I
mean
Mamie
with
Mrs.
Pocock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
Her
curiosity
,
if
nothing
else
,
will
in
any
case
work
*NL*
that
.
But
leave
it
all
to
Chad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
wailed
Madame
de
Vionnet
,
turning
away
a
little
wearily
,
``
the
*NL*
things
I
leave
to
Chad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
of
it
made
him
look
at
her
with
a
kindness
that
showed
his
*NL*
vision
of
her
suspense
.
But
he
fell
back
on
his
confidence
.
``
Oh
*NL*
well
--
trust
him
.
Trust
him
all
the
way
.
''
He
had
indeed
no
sooner
so
*NL*
spoken
than
the
queer
displacement
of
his
point
of
view
appeared
again
*NL*
to
come
up
for
him
in
the
very
sound
,
which
drew
from
him
a
short
*NL*
laugh
,
immediately
checked
.
He
became
still
more
advisory
.
``
When
they
*NL*
do
come
give
them
plenty
of
Miss
Jeanne
.
Let
Mamie
see
her
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
she
placed
them
face
to
face
.
``
For
Mamie
*NL*
to
hate
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
another
of
his
corrective
headshakes
.
``
Mamie
wo
n't
.
Trust
THEM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
hard
,
and
then
as
if
it
were
what
she
must
always
*NL*
come
back
to
:
``
It
's
you
I
trust
.
But
I
was
sincere
,
''
she
said
,
``
at
*NL*
the
hotel
.
I
did
,
I
do
,
want
my
child
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
--
Strether
waited
with
deference
while
she
appeared
to
hesitate
*NL*
as
to
how
to
put
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
do
what
she
can
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
for
a
little
met
her
eyes
on
it
;
after
which
something
that
*NL*
might
have
been
unexpected
to
her
came
from
him
.
``
Poor
little
duck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
more
expected
for
himself
indeed
might
well
have
been
her
echo
of
*NL*
it
.
``
Poor
little
duck
!
But
she
immensely
wants
herself
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
to
see
our
friend
's
cousin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
she
thinks
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
we
call
the
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
again
;
then
with
a
laugh
:
``
Well
,
your
daughter
will
help
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
at
last
he
took
leave
of
her
,
as
he
had
been
intending
for
five
*NL*
minutes
.
But
she
went
part
of
the
way
with
him
,
accompanying
him
out
*NL*
of
the
room
and
into
the
next
and
the
next
.
Her
noble
old
apartment
*NL*
offered
a
succession
of
three
,
the
first
two
of
which
indeed
,
on
*NL*
entering
,
smaller
than
the
last
,
but
each
with
its
faded
and
formal
*NL*
air
,
enlarged
the
office
of
the
antechamber
and
enriched
the
sense
of
*NL*
approach
.
Strether
fancied
them
,
liked
them
,
and
,
passing
through
them
*NL*
with
her
more
slowly
now
,
met
a
sharp
renewal
of
his
original
*NL*
impression
.
He
stopped
,
he
looked
back
;
the
whole
thing
made
a
vista
,
*NL*
which
he
found
high
melancholy
and
sweet
--
full
,
once
more
,
of
dim
*NL*
historic
shades
,
of
the
faint
faraway
cannon-roar
of
the
great
Empire
.
*NL*
It
was
doubtless
half
the
projection
of
his
mind
,
but
his
mind
was
a
*NL*
thing
that
,
among
old
waxed
parquets
,
pale
shades
of
pink
and
green
,
*NL*
pseudo-classic
candelabra
,
he
had
always
needfully
to
reckon
with
.
They
*NL*
could
easily
make
him
irrelevant
.
The
oddity
,
the
originality
,
the
*NL*
poetry
--
he
did
n't
know
what
to
call
it
--
of
Chad
's
connexion
reaffirmed
*NL*
for
him
its
romantic
side
.
``
They
ought
to
see
this
,
you
know
.
They
*NL*
MUST
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Pococks
?
''
--
she
looked
about
in
deprecation
;
she
seemed
to
see
gaps
*NL*
he
did
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamie
and
Sarah
--
Mamie
in
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
shabby
old
place
?
But
THEIR
things
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
their
things
!
You
were
talking
of
what
will
do
something
for
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
it
strikes
you
,
''
she
broke
in
,
``
that
my
poor
place
may
?
Oh
,
''
*NL*
she
ruefully
mused
,
``
that
WOULD
be
desperate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
wish
?
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
wish
Mrs.
Newsome
herself
*NL*
could
have
a
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
,
missing
a
little
his
logic
.
``
It
would
make
a
difference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
was
so
earnest
that
as
he
continued
to
look
about
he
laughed
.
*NL*
``
It
might
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
told
her
,
you
tell
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
about
you
?
Yes
,
a
wonderful
story
.
But
there
's
all
the
*NL*
indescribable
--
what
one
gets
only
on
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
she
charmingly
and
sadly
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
about
me
here
,
''
he
freely
continued
.
``
Mrs.
Newsome
feels
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
seemed
doomed
always
to
come
back
to
doubt
.
``
No
one
feels
so
*NL*
much
as
YOU
.
No
--
not
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
then
for
every
one
.
It
's
very
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
by
this
time
in
the
antechamber
,
still
alone
together
,
as
she
*NL*
had
n't
rung
for
a
servant
.
The
antechamber
was
high
and
square
,
grave
*NL*
and
suggestive
too
,
a
little
cold
and
slippery
even
in
summer
,
and
with
*NL*
a
few
old
prints
that
were
precious
,
Strether
divined
,
on
the
walls
.
He
*NL*
stood
in
the
middle
,
slightly
lingering
,
vaguely
directing
his
glasses
,
*NL*
while
,
leaning
against
the
door-post
of
the
room
,
she
gently
pressed
*NL*
her
cheek
to
the
side
of
the
recess
.
``
YOU
would
have
been
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
--
it
startled
him
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
reason
you
say
.
You
're
not
stupid
.
''
And
then
abruptly
,
as
if
*NL*
bringing
it
out
were
somehow
founded
on
that
fact
:
``
We
're
marrying
*NL*
Jeanne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
affected
him
on
the
spot
as
a
move
in
a
game
,
and
he
was
even
then
*NL*
not
without
the
sense
that
that
was
n't
the
way
Jeanne
should
be
*NL*
married
.
But
he
quickly
showed
his
interest
,
though
--
as
quickly
*NL*
afterwards
struck
him
--
with
an
absurd
confusion
of
mind
.
''
`
You
'
?
You
*NL*
and
--
a
--
not
Chad
?
''
Of
course
it
was
the
child
's
father
who
made
the
*NL*
`
we
,
'
but
to
the
child
's
father
it
would
have
cost
him
an
effort
to
*NL*
allude
.
Yet
did
n't
it
seem
the
next
minute
that
Monsieur
de
Vionnet
*NL*
was
after
all
not
in
question
?
--
since
she
had
gone
on
to
say
that
it
*NL*
was
indeed
to
Chad
she
referred
and
that
he
had
been
in
the
whole
*NL*
matter
kindness
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
must
tell
you
all
,
it
is
he
himself
who
has
put
us
in
the
way
.
I
*NL*
mean
in
the
way
of
an
opportunity
that
,
so
far
as
I
can
yet
see
,
is
all
*NL*
I
could
possibly
have
dreamed
of
.
For
all
the
trouble
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Vionnet
will
ever
take
!
''
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
to
him
*NL*
of
her
husband
,
and
he
could
n't
have
expressed
how
much
more
intimate
*NL*
with
her
it
suddenly
made
him
feel
.
It
was
n't
much
,
in
truth
--
there
*NL*
were
other
things
in
what
she
was
saying
that
were
far
more
;
but
it
was
*NL*
as
if
,
while
they
stood
there
together
so
easily
in
these
cold
chambers
*NL*
of
the
past
,
the
single
touch
had
shown
the
reach
of
her
confidence
.
*NL*
``
But
our
friend
,
''
she
asked
,
``
has
n't
then
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
told
me
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
has
come
with
rather
a
rush
--
all
in
a
very
few
days
;
and
*NL*
has
n't
moreover
yet
taken
a
form
that
permits
an
announcement
.
It
's
*NL*
only
for
you
--
absolutely
you
alone
--
that
I
speak
;
I
so
want
you
to
*NL*
know
.
''
The
sense
he
had
so
often
had
,
since
the
first
hour
of
his
*NL*
disembarkment
,
of
being
further
and
further
``
in
,
''
treated
him
again
at
*NL*
this
moment
to
another
twinge
;
but
in
this
wonderful
way
of
her
putting
*NL*
him
in
there
continued
to
be
something
exquisitely
remorseless
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Vionnet
will
accept
what
he
MUST
accept
.
He
has
proposed
*NL*
half
a
dozen
things
--
each
one
more
impossible
than
the
other
;
and
he
*NL*
would
n't
have
found
this
if
he
lives
to
a
hundred
.
Chad
found
it
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
with
her
lighted
,
faintly
flushed
,
her
conscious
confidential
*NL*
face
,
``
in
the
quietest
way
in
the
world
.
Or
rather
it
found
HIM
--
for
*NL*
everything
finds
him
;
I
mean
finds
him
right
.
You
'll
think
we
do
such
*NL*
things
strangely
--
but
at
my
age
,
''
she
smiled
,
``
one
has
to
accept
one
's
*NL*
conditions
.
Our
young
man
's
people
had
seen
her
;
one
of
his
sisters
,
a
*NL*
charming
woman
--
we
know
all
about
them
--
had
observed
her
somewhere
with
*NL*
me
.
She
had
spoken
to
her
brother
--
turned
him
on
;
and
we
were
again
*NL*
observed
,
poor
Jeanne
and
I
,
without
our
in
the
least
knowing
it
.
It
*NL*
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
;
it
went
on
for
some
time
;
it
*NL*
outlasted
our
absence
;
it
began
again
on
our
return
;
and
it
luckily
*NL*
seems
all
right
.
The
young
man
had
met
Chad
,
and
he
got
a
friend
to
*NL*
approach
him
--
as
having
a
decent
interest
in
us
.
Mr.
Newsome
looked
*NL*
well
before
he
leaped
;
he
kept
beautifully
quiet
and
satisfied
himself
*NL*
fully
;
then
only
he
spoke
.
It
's
what
has
for
some
time
past
occupied
*NL*
us
.
It
seems
as
if
it
were
what
would
do
;
really
,
really
all
one
could
*NL*
wish
.
There
are
only
two
or
three
points
to
be
settled
--
they
depend
on
*NL*
her
father
.
But
this
time
I
think
we
're
safe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
consciously
gaping
a
little
,
had
fairly
hung
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
.
''
And
then
he
permitted
himself
:
``
Does
*NL*
nothing
depend
on
HER
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
naturally
;
everything
did
.
But
she
's
pleased
comme
tout
.
She
has
*NL*
been
perfectly
free
;
and
he
--
our
young
friend
--
is
really
a
combination
.
*NL*
I
quite
adore
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
just
made
sure
.
``
You
mean
your
future
son-in-law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Future
if
we
all
bring
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
well
,
''
said
Strether
decorously
,
``
I
heartily
hope
you
may
.
''
There
*NL*
seemed
little
else
for
him
to
say
,
though
her
communication
had
the
*NL*
oddest
effect
on
him
.
Vaguely
and
confusedly
he
was
troubled
by
it
;
*NL*
feeling
as
if
he
had
even
himself
been
concerned
in
something
deep
and
*NL*
dim
.
He
had
allowed
for
depths
,
but
these
were
greater
:
and
it
was
as
*NL*
if
,
oppressively
--
indeed
absurdly
--
he
was
responsible
for
what
they
had
*NL*
now
thrown
up
to
the
surface
.
It
was
--
through
something
ancient
and
*NL*
cold
in
it
--
what
he
would
have
called
the
real
thing
.
In
short
his
*NL*
hostess
's
news
,
though
he
could
n't
have
explained
why
,
was
a
sensible
*NL*
shock
,
and
his
oppression
a
weight
he
felt
he
must
somehow
or
other
*NL*
immediately
get
rid
of
.
There
were
too
many
connexions
missing
to
make
*NL*
it
tolerable
he
should
do
anything
else
.
He
was
prepared
to
*NL*
suffer
--
before
his
own
inner
tribunal
--
for
Chad
;
he
was
prepared
to
*NL*
suffer
even
for
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
But
he
was
n't
prepared
to
suffer
*NL*
for
the
little
girl
So
now
having
said
the
proper
thing
,
he
wanted
to
*NL*
get
away
.
She
held
him
an
instant
,
however
,
with
another
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
seem
to
you
very
awful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awful
?
Why
so
?
''
But
he
called
it
to
himself
,
even
as
he
spoke
,
his
*NL*
biggest
insincerity
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
arrangements
are
so
different
from
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
?
''
Oh
he
could
dismiss
that
too
!
``
I
have
n't
any
arrangements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
accept
mine
;
all
the
more
that
they
're
excellent
.
*NL*
They
're
founded
on
a
vieille
sagesse
.
There
will
be
much
more
,
if
all
*NL*
goes
well
,
for
you
to
hear
and
to
know
,
and
everything
,
believe
me
,
for
*NL*
you
to
like
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
;
you
'll
be
satisfied
.
''
Thus
she
could
*NL*
talk
to
him
of
what
,
of
her
innermost
life
--
for
that
was
what
it
came
*NL*
to
--
he
must
``
accept
''
;
thus
she
could
extraordinarily
speak
as
if
in
*NL*
such
an
affair
his
being
satisfied
had
an
importance
.
It
was
all
a
*NL*
wonder
and
made
the
whole
case
larger
.
He
had
struck
himself
at
the
*NL*
hotel
,
before
Sarah
and
Waymarsh
,
as
being
in
her
boat
;
but
where
on
*NL*
earth
was
he
now
?
This
question
was
in
the
air
till
her
own
lips
*NL*
quenched
it
with
another
.
``
And
do
you
suppose
HE
--
who
loves
her
*NL*
so
--
would
do
anything
reckless
or
cruel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
what
he
supposed
.
``
Do
you
mean
your
young
man
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
yours
.
I
mean
Mr.
Newsome
.
''
It
flashed
for
Strether
the
next
*NL*
moment
a
finer
light
,
and
the
light
deepened
as
she
went
on
.
``
He
takes
,
*NL*
thank
God
,
the
truest
tenderest
interest
in
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
deepened
indeed
.
``
Oh
I
'm
sure
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
talking
,
''
she
said
,
``
about
one
's
trusting
him
.
You
see
then
*NL*
how
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
moment
--
it
all
came
.
``
I
see
--
I
see
.
''
He
felt
he
really
did
*NL*
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
hurt
her
for
the
world
,
nor
--
assuming
she
marries
at
*NL*
all
--
risk
anything
that
might
make
against
her
happiness
.
*NL*
And
--
willingly
,
at
least
--
he
would
never
hurt
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
,
with
what
he
had
by
this
time
grasped
,
told
him
more
than
her
*NL*
words
;
whether
something
had
come
into
it
,
or
whether
he
only
read
*NL*
clearer
,
her
whole
story
--
what
at
least
he
then
took
for
such
--
reached
*NL*
out
to
him
from
it
.
With
the
initiative
she
now
attributed
to
Chad
it
*NL*
all
made
a
sense
,
and
this
sense
--
a
light
,
a
lead
,
was
what
had
*NL*
abruptly
risen
before
him
.
He
wanted
,
once
more
,
to
get
off
with
these
*NL*
things
;
which
was
at
last
made
easy
,
a
servant
having
,
for
his
*NL*
assistance
,
on
hearing
voices
in
the
hall
,
just
come
forward
.
All
that
*NL*
Strether
had
made
out
was
,
while
the
man
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
impersonally
waited
,
summed
up
in
his
last
word
.
``
I
do
n't
think
,
you
*NL*
know
,
Chad
will
tell
me
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
perhaps
not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wo
n't
as
yet
speak
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
as
you
'll
think
best
.
You
must
judge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
finally
given
him
her
hand
,
which
he
held
a
moment
.
``
How
MUCH
*NL*
I
have
to
judge
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
,
''
said
Madame
de
Vionnet
:
a
remark
that
was
indeed
--
with
*NL*
the
refined
disguised
suppressed
passion
of
her
face
--
what
he
most
*NL*
carried
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
as
a
direct
approach
was
concerned
Sarah
had
neglected
him
,
for
*NL*
the
week
now
about
to
end
,
with
a
civil
consistency
of
chill
that
,
*NL*
giving
him
a
higher
idea
of
her
social
resource
,
threw
him
back
on
the
*NL*
general
reflexion
that
a
woman
could
always
be
amazing
.
It
indeed
*NL*
helped
a
little
to
console
him
that
he
felt
sure
she
had
for
the
same
*NL*
period
also
left
Chad
's
curiosity
hanging
;
though
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
for
his
personal
relief
,
Chad
could
at
least
go
through
the
various
*NL*
motions
--
and
he
made
them
extraordinarily
numerous
--
of
seeing
she
had
a
*NL*
good
time
.
There
was
n't
a
motion
on
which
,
in
her
presence
,
poor
*NL*
Strether
could
so
much
as
venture
,
and
all
he
could
do
when
he
was
out
*NL*
of
it
was
to
walk
over
for
a
talk
with
Maria
.
He
walked
over
of
course
*NL*
much
less
than
usual
,
but
he
found
a
special
compensation
in
a
certain
*NL*
half-hour
during
which
,
toward
the
close
of
a
crowded
empty
expensive
*NL*
day
,
his
several
companions
seemed
to
him
so
disposed
of
as
to
give
his
*NL*
forms
and
usages
a
rest
.
He
had
been
with
them
in
the
morning
and
had
*NL*
nevertheless
called
on
the
Pococks
in
the
afternoon
;
but
their
whole
*NL*
group
,
he
then
found
,
had
dispersed
after
a
fashion
of
which
it
would
*NL*
amuse
Miss
Gostrey
to
hear
.
He
was
sorry
again
,
gratefully
sorry
she
*NL*
was
so
out
of
it
--
she
who
had
really
put
him
in
;
but
she
had
*NL*
fortunately
always
her
appetite
for
news
.
The
pure
flame
of
the
*NL*
disinterested
burned
in
her
cave
of
treasures
as
a
lamp
in
a
Byzantine
*NL*
vault
.
It
was
just
now
,
as
happened
,
that
for
so
fine
a
sense
as
hers
*NL*
a
near
view
would
have
begun
to
pay
.
Within
three
days
,
precisely
,
the
*NL*
situation
on
which
he
was
to
report
had
shown
signs
of
an
equilibrium
;
*NL*
the
effect
of
his
look
in
at
the
hotel
was
to
confirm
this
appearance
.
*NL*
If
the
equilibrium
might
only
prevail
!
Sarah
was
out
with
Waymarsh
,
*NL*
Mamie
was
out
with
Chad
,
and
Jim
was
out
alone
.
Later
on
indeed
he
*NL*
himself
was
booked
to
Jim
,
was
to
take
him
that
evening
to
the
*NL*
Varieties
--
which
Strether
was
careful
to
pronounce
as
Jim
pronounced
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
drank
it
in
.
``
What
then
to-night
do
the
others
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
has
been
arranged
.
Waymarsh
takes
Sarah
to
dine
at
Bignons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
And
what
do
they
do
after
?
They
ca
n't
come
straight
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
ca
n't
come
straight
home
--
at
least
Sarah
ca
n't
.
It
's
their
*NL*
secret
,
but
I
think
I
've
guessed
it
.
''
Then
as
she
waited
:
``
The
circus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
stare
a
moment
longer
,
then
laugh
almost
to
extravagance
.
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
ME
?
''
--
he
only
wanted
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
all
of
you
together
--
like
all
of
us
:
Woollett
,
Milrose
and
their
*NL*
products
.
We
're
abysmal
--
but
may
we
never
be
less
so
!
Mr.
Newsome
,
''
*NL*
she
continued
,
``
meanwhile
takes
Miss
Pocock
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
--
to
the
Francais
:
to
see
what
you
took
Waymarsh
and
me
to
,
*NL*
a
family-bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
may
Mr.
Chad
enjoy
it
as
I
did
!
''
But
she
saw
so
much
in
*NL*
things
.
``
Do
they
spend
their
evenings
,
your
young
people
,
like
that
,
*NL*
alone
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
're
young
people
--
but
they
're
old
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
.
And
do
THEY
dine
--
for
a
difference
--
at
Brebant
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
where
they
dine
is
their
secret
too
.
But
I
've
my
idea
that
it
will
*NL*
be
,
very
quietly
,
at
Chad
's
own
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
come
to
him
there
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
.
``
He
has
known
her
from
a
child
.
*NL*
Besides
,
''
said
Strether
with
emphasis
,
``
Mamie
's
remarkable
.
She
's
*NL*
splendid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
Do
you
mean
she
expects
to
bring
it
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Getting
hold
of
him
?
No
--
I
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
want
him
enough
?
--
or
does
n't
believe
in
her
power
?
''
On
*NL*
which
as
he
said
nothing
she
continued
:
``
She
finds
she
does
n't
care
*NL*
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
think
she
finds
she
does
.
But
that
's
what
I
mean
by
so
*NL*
describing
her
.
It
's
IF
she
does
that
she
's
splendid
.
But
we
'll
see
,
''
*NL*
he
wound
up
,
``
where
she
comes
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
show
me
sufficiently
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
laughed
,
``
where
she
*NL*
goes
in
!
But
is
her
childhood
's
friend
,
''
she
asked
,
``
permitting
*NL*
himself
recklessly
to
flirt
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
that
.
Chad
's
also
splendid
.
They
're
ALL
splendid
!
''
he
*NL*
declared
with
a
sudden
strange
sound
of
wistfulness
and
envy
.
``
They
're
*NL*
at
least
HAPPY
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
?
''
--
it
appeared
,
with
their
various
difficulties
,
to
surprise
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
seem
to
myself
among
them
the
only
one
who
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
demurred
.
``
With
your
constant
tribute
to
the
ideal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
laugh
at
his
tribute
to
the
ideal
,
but
he
explained
after
a
*NL*
moment
his
impression
.
``
I
mean
they
're
living
.
They
're
rushing
about
.
*NL*
I
've
already
had
my
rushing
.
I
'm
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
n't
you
,
''
she
asked
by
way
of
cheer
,
``
waiting
with
ME
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
in
all
kindness
.
``
Yes
--
if
it
were
n't
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
help
me
to
wait
,
''
she
said
.
``
However
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
I
've
*NL*
really
something
for
you
that
will
help
you
to
wait
and
which
you
shall
*NL*
have
in
a
minute
.
Only
there
's
something
more
I
want
from
you
first
.
I
*NL*
revel
in
Sarah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
.
If
it
were
n't
,
''
he
again
amusedly
sighed
,
``
for
THAT

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
owe
more
to
women
than
any
man
I
ever
saw

We
do
seem
to
*NL*
keep
you
going

Yet
Sarah
,
as
I
see
her
,
must
be
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
IS

Strether
fully
assented
:
``
great
!
Whatever
happens
,

wo
n't
,
with
these
unforgettable
days
,
have
lived
in

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
had
a
pause
.
``
You
mean
she
has
fallen
in
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
she
wonders
if
she
has
n't

and
it
serves
all
her
purpose

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
indeed

Maria
laughed
,
``
served

's
purposes
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

for
giving
in

But
I
doubt
if
the
idea

an
idea

has
ever
up

to
now
answered
so
well
for
holding
out
.
That
's
HER
tribute
to
the
*NL*
ideal
--
we
each
have
our
own
.
It
's
her
romance

and
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
better
on
the
whole
than
mine
.
To
have
it
in
Paris
too

he
*NL*
explained
--
``
on
this
classic
ground
,
in
this
charged
infectious
air
,
*NL*
with
so
sudden
an
intensity
:
well

it
's
more
than
she
expected
.
She
*NL*
has
had
in
short
to
recognise
the
breaking
out
for
her
of
a
real
*NL*
affinity

and
with
everything
to
enhance
the
drama

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
followed
.
``
Jim
for
instance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim

Jim
hugely
enhances

Jim
was
made
to
enhance

And
then
Mr.

Waymarsh

It
's
the
crowning
touch
--
it
supplies
the
colour
.
He
's
*NL*
positively
separated

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
herself
unfortunately
is

that
supplies
the
colour
too

*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
was
all
there
.
But
somehow
--
!
``
Is
HE
in
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
at
her
a
long
time
;
then
looked
all
about
the
room
;
*NL*
then
came
a
little
nearer
.
``
Will
you
never
tell
any
one
in
the
world
*NL*
as
long
as
ever
you
live

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

It
was
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
Sarah
really
is

But
he
has
no
fear

Strether
hastened
to
*NL*
add
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
her
being
affected
by
it

*NL*
``

knows
she
can
hold
out
.
He
's
*NL*
helping
her
,
he
's
floating
her
over
,
by
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
rather
funnily
considered
it
.
``
Floating
her
over
in
champagne
?
*NL*
The
kindness
of
dining
her
,
nose
to
nose
,
at
the
hour
when
all
Paris
is
*NL*
crowding
to
profane
delights
,
and
in
the
--
well
,
in
the
great
temple
,
as
*NL*
one
hears
of
it
,
of
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
IT
,
for
both
of
them
,
''
Strether
insisted
--
``
and
all
of
a
*NL*
supreme
innocence
.
The
Parisian
place
,
the
feverish
hour
,
the
*NL*
putting
before
her
of
a
hundred
francs
'
worth
of
food
and
drink
,
which
*NL*
they
'll
scarcely
touch
--
all
that
's
the
dear
man
's
own
romance
;
the
*NL*
expensive
kind
,
expensive
in
francs
and
centimes
,
in
which
he
abounds
.
*NL*
And
the
circus
afterwards
--
which
is
cheaper
,
but
which
he
'll
find
some
*NL*
means
of
making
as
dear
as
possible
--
that
's
also
HIS
tribute
to
the
*NL*
ideal
.
It
does
for
him
.
He
'll
see
her
through
.
They
wo
n't
talk
of
*NL*
anything
worse
than
you
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
're
bad
enough
perhaps
,
thank
heaven

''
she
laughed
,
``
to
upset
*NL*
them
!
Mr.
Waymarsh
at
any
rate
is
a
hideous
old
coquette
.
''
And
the
*NL*
next
moment
she
had
dropped
everything
for
a
different
pursuit
.
``
What
*NL*
you
do
n't
appear
to
know
is
that
Jeanne
de
Vionnet
has
become
engaged
.
*NL*
She
's
to
marry
--
it
has
been
definitely
arranged
--
young
Monsieur
de
*NL*
Montbron
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fairly
blushed
.
``
Then
--
if
you
know
it
--
it
's
`
out
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
often
know
things
that
are
NOT
out

However
,
''
she
said
,
``
this
*NL*
will
be
out
to-morrow

But
I
see
I
've
counted
too
much
on
your
*NL*
possible
ignorance
.
You
've
been
before
me
,
and
I
do
n't
make
you
jump
*NL*
as
I
hoped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
gasp
at
her
insight
.
``
You
never
fail
!
I
've
HAD
my
jump

I
*NL*
had
it
when
I
first
heard

*NL*
*NL*
``

you
knew
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
as
soon
as
you
came
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
had
it
from
her
as
a
thing
not
yet
to
be
spoken
of
.

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
wondered
.
``
From
Madame
de
Vionnet
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
probability

I
've
waited

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
wait
no
longer
,
''
she
returned
.
``
It
reached
me
*NL*
yesterday

roundabout
and
accidental
,

by
a
person
who
had
had
it
*NL*
from
one
of
the
young
man

as
a

quite
settled

I
*NL*
was
only
keeping
it
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
Chad
would
n't
have
told

*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated

``
Well

he
has
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
n't

we
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
are

Maria
candidly
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
I
jumped
.
I
jumped
,
''
he
continued
to
explain
,
``
because
it
*NL*
means
,
this
disposition
of
the
daughter

that
there
's
now
nothing
else

nothing
else

him
and

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
simplifies

he
fully
concurred
.
``
But
that
's
precisely
where
we

are

It
marks
a
stage
in
his

his
answer
to
Mrs.

Newsome

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
tells

Maria
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
worst

*NL*
*NL*
``

the

what

He

At
which
Miss

eyebrows
went
up

``
You

she
has
already

dished
herself

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
a
turn
about
;
he
had
thought
it
out
again
and
again
*NL*
before
this
,
to
the
end
;
but
the
vista
seemed
each
time
longer
.
``
He
*NL*
wants
his
good
friend
to
know
the
best
.
I
mean
the
measure
of
his
*NL*
attachment
.
She
asked
for
a
sign
,
and
he
thought
of
that
one
.
There
*NL*
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
concession
to
her
jealousy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
pulled
up
.
``
Yes

call
it
that
.
Make
it
lurid

for
that
makes
*NL*
my
problem
richer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly

let
us
have
it
lurid

I
quite
agree
with
you
that
we

want
none

our
problems
poor

But
let
us
also
have
it
clear
.
Can
he
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
such
a
preoccupation
,
or
on
the
heels
of
it
,
have
*NL*
seriously
cared
for
Jeanne
?

cared
,
I
mean
,
as
a
young
man
at
liberty
*NL*
would
have
cared
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Strether
had
mastered
it
.
``
I
think
he
can
have
thought
it
would
*NL*
be
charming
if
he
COULD
care
.
It
would
be
nicer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicer
than
being
tied
up
to
Marie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
than
the
discomfort
of
an
attachment
to
a
person
he
can
never
*NL*
hope
,
short
of
a
catastrophe
,
to
marry
.
And
he
was
quite
right
,
''
said
*NL*
Strether
.
``
It
would
certainly
have
been
nicer

Even
when
a
thing
's
*NL*
already
nice
there
mostly
is
some
other
thing
that
would
have
been
*NL*
nicer
--
or
as
to
which
we
wonder
if
it
would
n't
.
But
his
question
was
*NL*
all
the
same
a
dream
.
He
COULD
n't
care
in
that
way
.
He
IS
tied
up
to
*NL*
Marie
.
The
relation
is
too
special
and
has
gone
too
far
.
It
's
the
*NL*
very
basis
,
and
his
recent
lively
contribution
toward
establishing
*NL*
Jeanne
in
life
has
been
his
definite
and
final
acknowledgement
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
that
he
has
ceased
squirming
.
I
doubt
meanwhile
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
``
if
Sarah
has
at
all
directly
attacked
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
brooded
.
``
But
wo
n't
he
wish
for
his
own
satisfaction
to
*NL*
make
his
ground
good
to
her
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
he
'll
leave
it
to
me
,
he
'll
leave
everything
to
me
.
I
`
sort
of
'
*NL*
feel
''
--
he
worked
it
out
--
``
that
the
whole
thing
will
come
upon
me

Yes
,
*NL*
I
shall
have
every
inch
and
every
ounce
of
it
.
I
shall
be
USED
for
*NL*
it
--
!
''
And
Strether
lost
himself
in
the
prospect
.
Then
he
fancifully
*NL*
expressed
the
issue
.
``
To
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
,
however
,
roundly
protested
.
``
Ah
you
'll
please
keep
a
drop
for
*NL*
ME
.
I
shall
have
a
use
for
it
!
''
--
which
she
did
n't
however
follow
up
.
*NL*
She
had
come
back
the
next
moment
to
another
matter
.
``
Mrs.
Pocock
,
with
*NL*
her
brother
,
is
trusting
only
to
her
general
charm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
would
seem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
charm
's
not
working
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Strether
put
it
otherwise
,
``
She
's
sounding
the
note
of
*NL*
home
--
which
is
the
very
best
thing
she
can
do
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
for
Madame
de
Vionnet

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
for
home
itself
.
The
natural
one
;
the
right
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
''
Maria
asked
,
``
when
it
fails
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
a
pause
.
``
The
difficulty
's
Jim
.
Jim
's
the
note
of
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
debated
.
``
Ah
surely
not
the
note
of
Mrs.
Newsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
it
all
.
``
The
note
of
the
home
for
which
Mrs.
Newsome
wants
*NL*
him
--
the
home
of
the
business
.
Jim
stands
,
with
his
little
legs
apart
,
*NL*
at
the
door
of
THAT
tent
;
and
Jim
is
,
frankly
speaking
,
extremely
*NL*
awful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
stared
.
``
And
you
in
,
you
poor
thing
,
for
your
evening
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
he
's
all
right
for
ME
!
''
Strether
laughed
.
``
Any
one
's
good
enough
*NL*
for
ME
.
But
Sarah
should
n't
,
all
the
same
,
have
brought
him
.
She
*NL*
does
n't
appreciate
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
was
amused
with
this
statement
of
it
.
``
Does
n't
know
,
you
*NL*
mean
,
how
bad
he
is
?

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
shook
his
head
with
decision
.
``
Not
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
.
``
Then
does
n't
Mrs.
Newsome
?

*NL*
*NL*
It
made
him
frankly
do
the
same
.
``
Well
,
no
--
since
you
ask
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
rubbed
it
in
.
``
Not
really
either
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
She
rates
him
rather
high
.
''
With
which
indeed
,
*NL*
immediately
,
he
took
himself
up
.
``
Well
,
he
IS
good
too
,
in
his
way
.
It
*NL*
depends
on
what
you
want
him
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
,
however
,
would
n't
let
it
depend
on
anything
--
would
n't
*NL*
have
it
,
and
would
n't
want
him
,
at
any
price
.
``
It
suits
my
book
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
that
he
should
be
impossible
;
and
it
suits
it
still
better
,
''
she
*NL*
more
imaginatively
added
,
``
that
Mrs.
Newsome
does
n't
know
he
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
in
consequence
,
had
to
take
it
from
her
,
but
he
fell
back
on
*NL*
something
else
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
who
does
really
know
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Waymarsh
?
Never
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
indeed

'm
not
ALWAYS
thinking
of

in
fact
I
find

now

never
am

Then
he
mentioned
the
person
as
if
there
were
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
it
.
``
Mamie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
own
sister

''
Oddly
enough
it
but
let
her
down
.
``
What
good
will
*NL*
that
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
perhaps

there

we
are

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
were
yet
again
,
accordingly
,
for
two
days
more
;
when
*NL*
Strether
,
on
being
,
at
Mrs.
Pocock
's
hotel
,
ushered
into
that
lady
's
*NL*
salon
,
found
himself
at
first
assuming
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
servant
who
had
introduced
him
and
retired
.
The
occupants
had
n't
come
*NL*
in
,
for
the
room
looked
empty
as
only
a
room
can
look
in
Paris
,
of
a
*NL*
fine
afternoon
when
the
faint
murmur
of
the
huge
collective
life
,
*NL*
carried
on
out
of
doors
,
strays
among
scattered
objects
even
as
a
*NL*
summer
air
idles
in
a
lonely
garden
.
Our
friend
looked
about
and
*NL*
hesitated
;
observed
,
on
the
evidence
of
a
table
charged
with
purchases
*NL*
and
other
matters
,
that
Sarah
had
become
possessed
--
by
no
aid
from
*NL*
HIM
--
of
the
last
number
of
the
salmon-coloured
Revue
;
noted
further
*NL*
that
Mamie
appeared
to
have
received
a
present
of
Fromentin
's
``
Maitres
*NL*
d'Autrefois
''
from
Chad
,
who
had
written
her
name
on
the
cover
;
and
*NL*
pulled
up
at
the
sight
of
a
heavy
letter
addressed
in
a
hand
he
knew
.
*NL*
This
letter
,
forwarded
by
a
banker
and
arriving
in
Mrs.
Pocock
's
*NL*
absence
,
had
been
placed
in
evidence
,
and
it
drew
from
the
fact
of
its
*NL*
being
unopened
a
sudden
queer
power
to
intensify
the
reach
of
its
*NL*
author
.
It
brought
home
to
him
the
scale
on
which
Mrs.
Newsome
--
for
*NL*
she
had
been
copious
indeed
this
time
--
was
writing
to
her
daughter
*NL*
while
she
kept
HIM
in
durance
;
and
it
had
altogether
such
an
effect
*NL*
upon
him
as
made
him
for
a
few
minutes
stand
still
and
breathe
low
.
In
*NL*
his
own
room
,
at
his
own
hotel
,
he
had
dozens
of
well-filled
envelopes
*NL*
superscribed
in
that
character
;
and
there
was
actually
something
in
the
*NL*
renewal
of
his
interrupted
vision
of
the
character
that
played
straight
*NL*
into
the
so
frequent
question
of
whether
he
were
n't
already
*NL*
disinherited
beyond
appeal
.
It
was
such
an
assurance
as
the
sharp
*NL*
downstrokes
of
her
pen
had
n't
yet
had
occasion
to
give
him
;
but
they
*NL*
somehow
at
the
present
crisis
stood
for
a
probable
absoluteness
in
any
*NL*
decree
of
the
writer
.
He
looked
at
Sarah
's
name
and
address
,
in
short
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
looking
hard
into
her
mother
's
face
,
and
then
turned
*NL*
from
it
as
if
the
face
had
declined
to
relax
.
But
since
it
was
in
a
*NL*
manner
as
if
Mrs.
Newsome
were
thereby
all
the
more
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
less
,
in
the
room
,
and
were
conscious
,
sharply
and
sorely
conscious
,
of
*NL*
himself
,
so
he
felt
both
held
and
hushed
,
summoned
to
stay
at
least
and
*NL*
take
his
punishment
.
By
staying
,
accordingly
,
he
took
it
--
creeping
*NL*
softly
and
vaguely
about
and
waiting
for
Sarah
to
come
in
.
She
WOULD
*NL*
come
in
if
he
stayed
long
enough
,
and
he
had
now
more
than
ever
the
*NL*
sense
of
her
success
in
leaving
him
a
prey
to
anxiety
.
It
was
n't
to
be
*NL*
denied
that
she
had
had
a
happy
instinct
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
Woollett
,
in
placing
him
thus
at
the
mercy
of
her
own
initiative
.
It
*NL*
was
very
well
to
try
to
say
he
did
n't
care
--
that
she
might
break
ground
*NL*
when
she
would
,
might
never
break
it
at
all
if
she
would
n't
,
and
that
*NL*
he
had
no
confession
whatever
to
wait
upon
her
with
:
he
breathed
from
*NL*
day
to
day
an
air
that
damnably
required
clearing
,
and
there
were
*NL*
moments
when
he
quite
ached
to
precipitate
that
process
.
He
could
n't
*NL*
doubt
that
,
should
she
only
oblige
him
by
surprising
him
just
as
he
*NL*
then
was
,
a
clarifying
scene
of
some
sort
would
result
from
the
*NL*
concussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
humbly
circulated
in
this
spirit
till
he
suddenly
had
a
fresh
*NL*
arrest
.
Both
the
windows
of
the
room
stood
open
to
the
balcony
,
but
it
*NL*
was
only
now
that
,
in
the
glass
of
the
leaf
of
one
of
them
,
folded
*NL*
back
,
he
caught
a
reflexion
quickly
recognised
as
the
colour
of
a
*NL*
lady
's
dress
.
Somebody
had
been
then
all
the
while
on
the
balcony
,
and
*NL*
the
person
,
whoever
it
might
be
,
was
so
placed
between
the
windows
as
*NL*
to
be
hidden
from
him
;
while
on
the
other
hand
the
many
sounds
of
the
*NL*
street
had
covered
his
own
entrance
and
movements
.
If
the
person
were
*NL*
Sarah
he
might
on
the
spot
therefore
be
served
to
his
taste
.
He
might
*NL*
lead
her
by
a
move
or
two
up
to
the
remedy
for
his
vain
tension
;
as
to
*NL*
which
,
should
he
get
nothing
else
from
it
,
he
would
at
least
have
the
*NL*
relief
of
pulling
down
the
roof
on
their
heads
.
There
was
fortunately
*NL*
no
one
at
hand
to
observe
--
in
respect
to
his
valour
--
that
even
on
this
*NL*
completed
reasoning
he
still
hung
fire
.
He
had
been
waiting
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
and
the
sound
of
the
oracle
;
but
he
had
to
gird
himself
*NL*
afresh
--
which
he
did
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
,
neither
advancing
*NL*
nor
retreating
--
before
provoking
the
revelation
.
It
was
apparently
for
*NL*
Sarah
to
come
more
into
view
;
he
was
in
that
case
there
at
her
service
.
*NL*
She
did
however
,
as
meanwhile
happened
,
come
more
into
view
;
only
she
*NL*
luckily
came
at
the
last
minute
as
a
contradiction
of
Sarah
.
The
*NL*
occupant
of
the
balcony
was
after
all
quite
another
person
,
a
person
*NL*
presented
,
on
a
second
look
,
by
a
charming
back
and
a
slight
shift
of
*NL*
her
position
,
as
beautiful
brilliant
unconscious
Mamie
--
Mamie
alone
at
*NL*
home
,
Mamie
passing
her
time
in
her
own
innocent
way
,
Mamie
in
short
*NL*
rather
shabbily
used
,
but
Mamie
absorbed
interested
and
interesting
.
*NL*
With
her
arms
on
the
balustrade
and
her
attention
dropped
to
the
street
*NL*
she
allowed
Strether
to
watch
her
,
to
consider
several
things
,
without
*NL*
her
turning
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
oddity
was
that
when
he
HAD
so
watched
and
considered
he
simply
*NL*
stepped
back
into
the
room
without
following
up
his
advantage
.
He
*NL*
revolved
there
again
for
several
minutes
,
quite
as
with
something
new
*NL*
to
think
of
and
as
if
the
bearings
of
the
possibility
of
Sarah
had
been
*NL*
superseded
.
For
frankly
,
yes
,
it
HAD
bearings
thus
to
find
the
girl
in
*NL*
solitary
possession
.
There
was
something
in
it
that
touched
him
to
a
*NL*
point
not
to
have
been
reckoned
beforehand
,
something
that
softly
but
*NL*
quite
pressingly
spoke
to
him
,
and
that
spoke
the
more
each
time
he
*NL*
paused
again
at
the
edge
of
the
balcony
and
saw
her
still
unaware
.
Her
*NL*
companions
were
plainly
scattered
;
Sarah
would
be
off
somewhere
with
*NL*
Waymarsh
and
Chad
off
somewhere
with
Jim
.
Strether
did
n't
at
all
*NL*
mentally
impute
to
Chad
that
he
was
with
his
``
good
friend
''
;
he
gave
him
*NL*
the
benefit
of
supposing
him
involved
in
appearances
that
,
had
he
had
*NL*
to
describe
them
--
for
instance
to
Maria
--
he
would
have
conveniently
*NL*
qualified
as
more
subtle
.
It
came
to
him
indeed
the
next
thing
that
*NL*
there
was
perhaps
almost
an
excess
of
refinement
in
having
left
Mamie
*NL*
in
such
weather
up
there
alone
;
however
she
might
in
fact
have
*NL*
extemporised
,
under
the
charm
of
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
a
little
makeshift
*NL*
Paris
of
wonder
arid
fancy
.
Our
friend
in
any
case
now
recognised
--
and
*NL*
it
was
as
if
at
the
recognition
Mrs.
Newsome
's
fixed
intensity
had
*NL*
suddenly
,
with
a
deep
audible
gasp
,
grown
thin
and
vague
--
that
day
*NL*
after
day
he
had
been
conscious
in
respect
to
his
young
lady
of
*NL*
something
odd
and
ambiguous
,
yet
something
into
which
he
could
at
last
*NL*
read
a
meaning
.
It
had
been
at
the
most
,
this
mystery
,
an
*NL*
obsession
--
oh
an
obsession
agreeable
;
and
it
had
just
now
fallen
into
*NL*
its
place
as
at
the
touch
of
a
spring
.
It
had
represented
the
*NL*
possibility
between
them
of
some
communication
baffled
by
accident
and
*NL*
delay
--
the
possibility
even
of
some
relation
as
yet
unacknowledged
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
always
their
old
relation
,
the
fruit
of
the
Woollett
years
;
*NL*
but
that
--
and
it
was
what
was
strangest
--
had
nothing
whatever
in
common
*NL*
with
what
was
now
in
the
air
.
As
a
child
,
as
a
``
bud
,
''
and
then
again
*NL*
as
a
flower
of
expansion
,
Mamie
had
bloomed
for
him
,
freely
,
in
the
*NL*
almost
incessantly
open
doorways
of
home
;
where
he
remembered
her
as
*NL*
first
very
forward
,
as
then
very
backward
--
for
he
had
carried
on
at
one
*NL*
period
,
in
Mrs.
Newsome
's
parlours
-LRB-
oh
Mrs.
Newsome
's
phases
and
his
*NL*
own
!
-RRB-
a
course
of
English
Literature
re-enforced
by
exams
and
teas
--
and
*NL*
once
more
,
finally
,
as
very
much
in
advance
.
But
he
had
kept
no
great
*NL*
sense
of
points
of
contact
;
it
not
being
in
the
nature
of
things
at
*NL*
Woollett
that
the
freshest
of
the
buds
should
find
herself
in
the
same
*NL*
basket
with
the
most
withered
of
the
winter
apples
.
The
child
had
*NL*
given
sharpness
,
above
all
,
to
his
sense
of
the
flight
of
time
;
it
was
*NL*
but
the
day
before
yesterday
that
he
had
tripped
up
on
her
hoop
,
yet
*NL*
his
experience
of
remarkable
women
--
destined
,
it
would
seem
,
remarkably
*NL*
to
grow
--
felt
itself
ready
this
afternoon
,
quite
braced
itself
,
to
*NL*
include
her
.
She
had
in
fine
more
to
say
to
him
than
he
had
ever
*NL*
dreamed
the
pretty
girl
of
the
moment
COULD
have
;
and
the
proof
of
the
*NL*
circumstance
was
that
,
visibly
,
unmistakeably
,
she
had
been
able
to
say
*NL*
it
to
no
one
else
.
It
was
something
she
could
mention
neither
to
her
*NL*
brother
,
to
her
sister-in-law
nor
to
Chad
;
though
he
could
just
imagine
*NL*
that
had
she
still
been
at
home
she
might
have
brought
it
out
,
as
a
*NL*
supreme
tribute
to
age
,
authority
and
attitude
,
for
Mrs.
Newsome
.
It
*NL*
was
moreover
something
in
which
they
all
took
an
interest
;
the
strength
*NL*
of
their
interest
was
in
truth
just
the
reason
of
her
prudence
.
All
*NL*
this
then
,
for
five
minutes
,
was
vivid
to
Strether
,
and
it
put
before
*NL*
him
that
,
poor
child
,
she
had
now
but
her
prudence
to
amuse
her
.
That
,
*NL*
for
a
pretty
girl
in
Paris
,
struck
him
,
with
a
rush
,
as
a
sorry
state
;
*NL*
so
that
under
the
impression
he
went
out
to
her
with
a
step
as
*NL*
hypocritically
alert
,
he
was
well
aware
,
as
if
he
had
just
come
into
*NL*
the
room
.
She
turned
with
a
start
at
his
voice
;
preoccupied
with
him
*NL*
though
she
might
be
,
she
was
just
a
scrap
disappointed
.
``
Oh
I
thought
*NL*
you
were
Mr.
Bilham
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remark
had
been
at
first
surprising
and
our
friend
's
private
*NL*
thought
,
under
the
influence
of
it
,
temporarily
blighted
;
yet
we
are
*NL*
able
to
add
that
he
presently
recovered
his
inward
tone
and
that
many
a
*NL*
fresh
flower
of
fancy
was
to
bloom
in
the
same
air
.
Little
*NL*
Bilham
--
since
little
Bilham
was
,
somewhat
incongruously
,
*NL*
expected
--
appeared
behindhand
;
a
circumstance
by
which
Strether
was
to
*NL*
profit
.
They
came
back
into
the
room
together
after
a
little
,
the
*NL*
couple
on
the
balcony
,
and
amid
its
crimson-and-gold
elegance
,
with
the
*NL*
others
still
absent
,
Strether
passed
forty
minutes
that
he
appraised
*NL*
even
at
the
time
as
far
,
in
the
whole
queer
connexion
,
from
his
idlest
.
*NL*
Yes
indeed
,
since
he
had
the
other
day
so
agreed
with
Maria
about
the
*NL*
inspiration
of
the
lurid
,
here
was
something
for
his
problem
that
*NL*
surely
did
n't
make
it
shrink
and
that
was
floated
in
upon
him
as
part
*NL*
of
a
sudden
flood
.
He
was
doubtless
not
to
know
till
afterwards
,
on
*NL*
turning
them
over
in
thought
,
of
how
many
elements
his
impression
was
*NL*
composed
;
but
he
none
the
less
felt
,
as
he
sat
with
the
charming
girl
,
*NL*
the
signal
growth
of
a
confidence
.
For
she
WAS
charming
,
when
all
was
*NL*
said
--
and
none
the
less
so
for
the
visible
habit
and
practice
of
*NL*
freedom
and
fluency
.
She
was
charming
,
he
was
aware
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
if
he
had
n't
found
her
so
he
would
have
found
her
something
*NL*
he
should
have
been
in
peril
of
expressing
as
``
funny
.
''
Yes
,
she
was
*NL*
funny
,
wonderful
Mamie
,
and
without
dreaming
it
;
she
was
bland
,
she
was
*NL*
bridal
--
with
never
,
that
he
could
make
out
as
yet
,
a
bridegroom
to
*NL*
support
it
;
she
was
handsome
and
portly
and
easy
and
chatty
,
soft
and
*NL*
sweet
and
almost
disconcertingly
reassuring
.
She
was
dressed
,
if
we
*NL*
might
so
far
discriminate
,
less
as
a
young
lady
than
as
an
old
one
--
had
*NL*
an
old
one
been
supposable
to
Strether
as
so
committed
to
vanity
;
the
*NL*
complexities
of
her
hair
missed
moreover
also
the
looseness
of
youth
;
*NL*
and
she
had
a
mature
manner
of
bending
a
little
,
as
to
encourage
and
*NL*
reward
,
while
she
held
neatly
together
in
front
of
her
a
pair
of
*NL*
strikingly
polished
hands
:
the
combination
of
all
of
which
kept
up
*NL*
about
her
the
glamour
of
her
``
receiving
,
''
placed
her
again
perpetually
*NL*
between
the
windows
and
within
sound
of
the
ice-cream
plates
,
suggested
*NL*
the
enumeration
of
all
the
names
,
all
the
Mr.
Brookses
and
Mr.
*NL*
Snookses
,
gregarious
specimens
of
a
single
type
,
she
was
happy
to
*NL*
``
meet
.
''
But
if
all
this
was
where
she
was
funny
,
and
if
what
was
*NL*
funnier
than
the
rest
was
the
contrast
between
her
beautiful
benevolent
*NL*
patronage
--
such
a
hint
of
the
polysyllabic
as
might
make
her
something
*NL*
of
a
bore
toward
middle
age
--
and
her
rather
flat
little
voice
,
the
*NL*
voice
,
naturally
,
unaffectedly
yet
,
of
a
girl
of
fifteen
;
so
Strether
,
*NL*
none
the
less
,
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
,
felt
in
her
a
quiet
dignity
*NL*
that
pulled
things
bravely
together
.
If
quiet
dignity
,
almost
more
*NL*
than
matronly
,
with
voluminous
,
too
voluminous
clothes
,
was
the
effect
*NL*
she
proposed
to
produce
,
that
was
an
ideal
one
could
like
in
her
when
*NL*
once
one
had
got
into
relation
.
The
great
thing
now
for
her
visitor
*NL*
was
that
this
was
exactly
what
he
had
done
;
it
made
so
extraordinary
a
*NL*
mixture
of
the
brief
and
crowded
hour
.
It
was
the
mark
of
a
relation
*NL*
that
he
had
begun
so
quickly
to
find
himself
sure
she
was
,
of
all
*NL*
people
,
as
might
have
been
said
,
on
the
side
and
of
the
party
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
's
original
ambassador
.
She
was
in
HIS
interest
and
not
in
*NL*
Sarah
's
,
and
some
sign
of
that
was
precisely
what
he
had
been
feeling
*NL*
in
her
,
these
last
days
,
as
imminent
.
Finally
placed
,
in
Paris
,
in
*NL*
immediate
presence
of
the
situation
and
of
the
hero
of
it
--
by
whom
*NL*
Strether
was
incapable
of
meaning
any
one
but
Chad
--
she
had
*NL*
accomplished
,
and
really
in
a
manner
all
unexpected
to
herself
,
a
*NL*
change
of
base
;
deep
still
things
had
come
to
pass
within
her
,
and
by
*NL*
the
time
she
had
grown
sure
of
them
Strether
had
become
aware
of
the
*NL*
little
drama
.
When
she
knew
where
she
was
,
in
short
,
he
had
made
it
*NL*
out
;
and
he
made
it
out
at
present
still
better
;
though
with
never
a
*NL*
direct
word
passing
between
them
all
the
while
on
the
subject
of
his
*NL*
own
predicament
.
There
had
been
at
first
,
as
he
sat
there
with
her
,
a
*NL*
moment
during
which
he
wondered
if
she
meant
to
break
ground
in
respect
*NL*
to
his
prime
undertaking
.
That
door
stood
so
strangely
ajar
that
he
*NL*
was
half-prepared
to
be
conscious
,
at
any
juncture
,
of
her
having
,
of
*NL*
any
one
's
having
,
quite
bounced
in
.
But
,
friendly
,
familiar
,
light
of
*NL*
touch
and
happy
of
tact
,
she
exquisitely
stayed
out
;
so
that
it
was
for
*NL*
all
the
world
as
if
to
show
she
could
deal
with
him
without
being
*NL*
reduced
to
--
well
,
scarcely
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
fully
came
up
for
them
then
,
by
means
of
their
talking
of
everything
*NL*
BUT
Chad
,
that
Mamie
,
unlike
Sarah
,
unlike
Jim
,
knew
perfectly
what
had
*NL*
become
of
him
.
It
fully
came
up
that
she
had
taken
to
the
last
*NL*
fraction
of
an
inch
the
measure
of
the
change
in
him
,
and
that
she
*NL*
wanted
Strether
to
know
what
a
secret
she
proposed
to
make
of
it
.
They
*NL*
talked
most
conveniently
--
as
if
they
had
had
no
chance
yet
--
about
*NL*
Woollett
;
and
that
had
virtually
the
effect
of
their
keeping
the
secret
*NL*
more
close
.
The
hour
took
on
for
Strether
,
little
by
little
,
a
queer
*NL*
sad
sweetness
of
quality
,
he
had
such
a
revulsion
in
Mamie
's
favour
and
*NL*
on
behalf
of
her
social
value
as
might
have
come
from
remorse
at
some
*NL*
early
injustice
.
She
made
him
,
as
under
the
breath
of
some
vague
*NL*
western
whiff
,
homesick
and
freshly
restless
;
he
could
really
for
the
*NL*
time
have
fancied
himself
stranded
with
her
on
a
far
shore
,
during
an
*NL*
ominous
calm
,
in
a
quaint
community
of
shipwreck
.
Their
little
*NL*
interview
was
like
a
picnic
on
a
coral
strand
;
they
passed
each
other
,
*NL*
with
melancholy
smiles
and
looks
sufficiently
allusive
,
such
cupfuls
of
*NL*
water
as
they
had
saved
.
Especially
sharp
in
Strether
meanwhile
was
*NL*
the
conviction
that
his
companion
really
knew
,
as
we
have
hinted
,
where
*NL*
she
had
come
out
.
It
was
at
a
very
particular
place
--
only
THAT
she
*NL*
would
never
tell
him
;
it
would
be
above
all
what
he
should
have
to
*NL*
puzzle
for
himself
.
This
was
what
he
hoped
for
,
because
his
interest
*NL*
in
the
girl
would
n't
be
complete
without
it
.
No
more
would
the
*NL*
appreciation
to
which
she
was
entitled
--
so
assured
was
he
that
the
more
*NL*
he
saw
of
her
process
the
more
he
should
see
of
her
pride
.
She
saw
,
*NL*
herself
,
everything
;
but
she
knew
what
she
did
n't
want
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
that
had
helped
her
.
What
did
n't
she
want
?
--
there
was
a
pleasure
lost
*NL*
for
her
old
friend
in
not
yet
knowing
,
as
there
would
doubtless
be
a
*NL*
thrill
in
getting
a
glimpse
.
Gently
and
sociably
she
kept
that
dark
to
*NL*
him
,
and
it
was
as
if
she
soothed
and
beguiled
him
in
other
ways
to
*NL*
make
up
for
it
.
She
came
out
with
her
impression
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
--
of
whom
she
had
``
heard
so
much
''
;
she
came
out
with
her
*NL*
impression
of
Jeanne
,
whom
she
had
been
``
dying
to
see
''
:
she
brought
it
*NL*
out
with
a
blandness
by
which
her
auditor
was
really
stirred
that
she
*NL*
had
been
with
Sarah
early
that
very
afternoon
,
and
after
dreadful
*NL*
delays
caused
by
all
sorts
of
things
,
mainly
,
eternally
,
by
the
*NL*
purchase
of
clothes
--
clothes
that
unfortunately
would
n't
be
themselves
*NL*
eternal
--
to
call
in
the
Rue
de
Bellechasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
these
names
Strether
almost
blushed
to
feel
that
he
*NL*
could
n't
have
sounded
them
first
--
and
yet
could
n't
either
have
*NL*
justified
his
squeamishness
.
Mamie
made
them
easy
as
he
could
n't
have
*NL*
begun
to
do
,
and
yet
it
could
only
have
cost
her
more
than
he
should
*NL*
ever
have
had
to
spend
.
It
was
as
friends
of
Chad
's
,
friends
special
,
*NL*
distinguished
,
desirable
,
enviable
,
that
she
spoke
of
them
,
and
she
*NL*
beautifully
carried
it
off
that
much
as
she
had
heard
of
them
--
though
*NL*
she
did
n't
say
how
or
where
,
which
was
a
touch
of
her
own
--
she
had
*NL*
found
them
beyond
her
supposition
.
She
abounded
in
praise
of
them
,
and
*NL*
after
the
manner
of
Woollett
--
which
made
the
manner
of
Woollett
a
*NL*
loveable
thing
again
to
Strether
.
He
had
never
so
felt
the
true
*NL*
inwardness
of
it
as
when
his
blooming
companion
pronounced
the
elder
of
*NL*
the
ladies
of
the
Rue
de
Bellechasse
too
fascinating
for
words
and
*NL*
declared
of
the
younger
that
she
was
perfectly
ideal
,
a
real
little
*NL*
monster
of
charm
.
``
Nothing
,
''
she
said
of
Jeanne
,
``
ought
ever
to
happen
*NL*
to
her
--
she
's
so
awfully
right
as
she
is
.
Another
touch
will
spoil
*NL*
her
--
so
she
ought
n't
to
BE
touched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
things
,
here
in
Paris
,
''
Strether
observed
,
``
do
happen
to
little
*NL*
girls
.
''
And
then
for
the
joke
's
and
the
occasion
's
sake
:
``
Have
n't
you
*NL*
found
that
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
things
happen
--
?
Oh
I
'm
not
a
little
girl
.
I
'm
a
big
battered
*NL*
blowsy
one
.
I
do
n't
care
,
''
Mamie
laughed
,
``
WHAT
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
a
pause
while
he
wondered
if
it
might
n't
happen
that
he
*NL*
should
give
her
the
pleasure
of
learning
that
he
found
her
nicer
than
*NL*
he
had
really
dreamed
--
a
pause
that
ended
when
he
had
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
,
so
far
as
it
at
all
mattered
for
her
,
she
had
in
fact
perhaps
*NL*
already
made
this
out
.
He
risked
accordingly
a
different
*NL*
question
--
though
conscious
,
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
,
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
place
it
in
relation
to
her
last
speech
.
``
But
that
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Vionnet
is
to
be
married
--
I
suppose
you
've
heard
of
THAT
.
''
For
all
,
he
*NL*
then
found
,
he
need
fear
!
``
Dear
,
yes
;
the
gentleman
was
there
:
*NL*
Monsieur
de
Montbron
,
whom
Madame
de
Vionnet
presented
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
he
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mamie
bloomed
and
bridled
with
her
best
reception
manner
.
``
Any
man
's
*NL*
nice
when
he
's
in
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
Strether
laugh
.
``
But
is
Monsieur
de
Montbron
in
*NL*
love
--
already
--
with
YOU
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
's
not
necessary
--
it
's
so
much
better
he
should
be
so
with
HER
:
*NL*
which
,
thank
goodness
,
I
lost
no
time
in
discovering
for
myself
.
He
's
*NL*
perfectly
gone
--
and
I
could
n't
have
borne
it
for
her
if
he
had
n't
been
.
*NL*
She
's
just
too
sweet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
And
through
being
in
love
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
with
a
smile
that
struck
him
as
wonderful
Mamie
had
a
*NL*
wonderful
answer
.
``
She
does
n't
know
if
she
is
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
him
again
laugh
out
.
``
Oh
but
YOU
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
willing
to
take
it
that
way
.
``
Oh
yes
,
I
know
everything
.
''
And
*NL*
as
she
sat
there
rubbing
her
polished
hands
and
making
the
best
of
*NL*
it
--
only
holding
her
elbows
perhaps
a
little
too
much
out
--
the
*NL*
momentary
effect
for
Strether
was
that
every
one
else
,
in
all
their
*NL*
affair
,
seemed
stupid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
that
poor
little
Jeanne
does
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
near
as
they
came
to
saying
that
she
was
probably
in
love
*NL*
with
Chad
;
but
it
was
quite
near
enough
for
what
Strether
wanted
;
which
*NL*
was
to
be
confirmed
in
his
certitude
that
,
whether
in
love
or
not
,
she
*NL*
appealed
to
something
large
and
easy
in
the
girl
before
him
.
Mamie
*NL*
would
be
fat
,
too
fat
,
at
thirty
;
but
she
would
always
be
the
person
*NL*
who
,
at
the
present
sharp
hour
,
had
been
disinterestedly
tender
.
``
If
I
*NL*
see
a
little
more
of
her
,
as
I
hope
I
shall
,
I
think
she
'll
like
me
*NL*
enough
--
for
she
seemed
to
like
me
to-day
--
to
want
me
to
tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
SHALL
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
.
I
shall
tell
her
the
matter
with
her
is
that
she
wants
*NL*
only
too
much
to
do
right
.
To
do
right
for
her
,
naturally
,
''
said
*NL*
Mamie
,
``
is
to
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
,
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
waited
.
``
And
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
`
then
'
--
Mr.
Newsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
really
grand
for
him
in
the
serenity
of
this
*NL*
reference
.
``
And
last
only
Monsieur
de
Montbron
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
only
''
--
she
good-humouredly
kept
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
considered
.
``
So
that
every
one
after
all
then
will
be
suited
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
one
of
her
few
hesitations
,
but
it
was
a
question
only
of
a
*NL*
moment
;
and
it
was
her
nearest
approach
to
being
explicit
with
him
*NL*
about
what
was
between
them
.
``
I
think
I
can
speak
for
myself
.
I
shall
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
said
indeed
so
much
,
told
such
a
story
of
her
being
ready
to
help
*NL*
him
,
so
committed
to
him
that
truth
,
in
short
,
for
such
use
as
he
might
*NL*
make
of
it
toward
those
ends
of
his
own
with
which
,
patiently
and
*NL*
trustfully
,
she
had
nothing
to
do
--
it
so
fully
achieved
all
this
that
*NL*
he
appeared
to
himself
simply
to
meet
it
in
its
own
spirit
by
the
last
*NL*
frankness
of
admiration
.
Admiration
was
of
itself
almost
accusatory
,
*NL*
but
nothing
less
would
serve
to
show
her
how
nearly
he
understood
.
He
*NL*
put
out
his
hand
for
good-bye
with
a
``
Splendid
,
splendid
,
splendid
!
''
*NL*
And
he
left
her
,
in
her
splendour
,
still
waiting
for
little
Bilham
.

*NL*
Book

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
occupied
beside
little
Bilham
,
three
evenings
after
his
*NL*
interview
with
Mamie
Pocock
,
the
same
deep
divan
they
had
enjoyed
*NL*
together
on
the
first
occasion
of
our
friend
's
meeting
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
and
her
daughter
in
the
apartment
of
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
,
*NL*
where
his
position
affirmed
itself
again
as
ministering
to
an
easy
*NL*
exchange
of
impressions
.
The
present
evening
had
a
different
stamp
;
if
*NL*
the
company
was
much
more
numerous
,
so
,
inevitably
,
were
the
ideas
set
*NL*
in
motion
.
It
was
on
the
other
hand
,
however
,
now
strongly
marked
that
*NL*
the
talkers
moved
,
in
respect
to
such
matters
,
round
an
inner
,
a
*NL*
protected
circle
.
They
knew
at
any
rate
what
really
concerned
them
*NL*
to-night
,
and
Strether
had
begun
by
keeping
his
companion
close
to
it
.
*NL*
Only
a
few
of
Chad
's
guests
had
dined
--
that
is
fifteen
or
twenty
,
a
few
*NL*
compared
with
the
large
concourse
offered
to
sight
by
eleven
o'clock
;
*NL*
but
number
and
mass
,
quantity
and
quality
,
light
,
fragrance
,
sound
,
the
*NL*
overflow
of
hospitality
meeting
the
high
tide
of
response
,
had
all
from
*NL*
the
first
pressed
upon
Strether
's
consciousness
,
and
he
felt
himself
*NL*
somehow
part
and
parcel
of
the
most
festive
scene
,
as
the
term
was
,
in
*NL*
which
he
had
ever
in
his
life
been
engaged
.
He
had
perhaps
seen
,
on
*NL*
Fourths
of
July
and
on
dear
old
domestic
Commencements
,
more
people
*NL*
assembled
,
but
he
had
never
seen
so
many
in
proportion
to
the
space
,
or
*NL*
had
at
all
events
never
known
so
great
a
promiscuity
to
show
so
*NL*
markedly
as
picked
.
Numerous
as
was
the
company
,
it
had
still
been
made
*NL*
so
by
selection
,
and
what
was
above
all
rare
for
Strether
was
that
,
by
*NL*
no
fault
of
his
own
,
he
was
in
the
secret
of
the
principle
that
had
*NL*
worked
.
He
had
n't
enquired
,
he
had
averted
his
head
,
but
Chad
had
put
*NL*
him
a
pair
of
questions
that
themselves
smoothed
the
ground
.
He
had
n't
*NL*
answered
the
questions
,
he
had
replied
that
they
were
the
young
man
's
*NL*
own
affair
;
and
he
had
then
seen
perfectly
that
the
latter
's
direction
*NL*
was
already
settled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
applied
for
counsel
only
by
way
of
intimating
that
he
knew
*NL*
what
to
do
;
and
he
had
clearly
never
known
it
better
than
in
now
*NL*
presenting
to
his
sister
the
whole
circle
of
his
society
.
This
was
all
*NL*
in
the
sense
and
the
spirit
of
the
note
struck
by
him
on
that
lady
's
*NL*
arrival
;
he
had
taken
at
the
station
itself
a
line
that
led
him
without
*NL*
a
break
,
and
that
enabled
him
to
lead
the
Pococks
--
though
dazed
a
*NL*
little
,
no
doubt
,
breathless
,
no
doubt
,
and
bewildered
--
to
the
*NL*
uttermost
end
of
the
passage
accepted
by
them
perforce
as
pleasant
.
He
*NL*
had
made
it
for
them
violently
pleasant
and
mercilessly
full
;
the
*NL*
upshot
of
which
was
,
to
Strether
's
vision
,
that
they
had
come
all
the
*NL*
way
without
discovering
it
to
be
really
no
passage
at
all
.
It
was
a
*NL*
brave
blind
alley
,
where
to
pass
was
impossible
and
where
,
unless
they
*NL*
stuck
fast
,
they
would
have
--
which
was
always
awkward
--
publicly
to
back
*NL*
out
.
They
were
touching
bottom
assuredly
tonight
;
the
whole
scene
*NL*
represented
the
terminus
of
the
cul-de-sac
.
So
could
things
go
when
*NL*
there
was
a
hand
to
keep
them
consistent
--
a
hand
that
pulled
the
wire
*NL*
with
a
skill
at
which
the
elder
man
more
and
more
marvelled
.
The
elder
*NL*
man
felt
responsible
,
but
he
also
felt
successful
,
since
what
had
taken
*NL*
place
was
simply
the
issue
of
his
own
contention
,
six
weeks
before
,
*NL*
that
they
properly
should
wait
to
see
what
their
friends
would
have
*NL*
really
to
say
.
He
had
determined
Chad
to
wait
,
he
had
determined
him
*NL*
to
see
;
he
was
therefore
not
to
quarrel
with
the
time
given
up
to
the
*NL*
business
.
As
much
as
ever
,
accordingly
,
now
that
a
fortnight
had
*NL*
elapsed
,
the
situation
created
for
Sarah
,
and
against
which
she
had
*NL*
raised
no
protest
,
was
that
of
her
having
accommodated
herself
to
her
*NL*
adventure
as
to
a
pleasure-party
surrendered
perhaps
even
somewhat
in
*NL*
excess
to
bustle
and
to
``
pace
.
''
If
her
brother
had
been
at
any
point
*NL*
the
least
bit
open
to
criticism
it
might
have
been
on
the
ground
of
his
*NL*
spicing
the
draught
too
highly
and
pouring
the
cup
too
full
.
Frankly
*NL*
treating
the
whole
occasion
of
the
presence
of
his
relatives
as
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
amusement
,
he
left
it
,
no
doubt
,
but
scant
margin
as
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
anything
else
.
He
suggested
,
invented
,
abounded
--
yet
*NL*
all
the
while
with
the
loosest
easiest
rein
.
Strether
,
during
his
own
*NL*
weeks
,
had
gained
a
sense
of
knowing
Paris
;
but
he
saw
it
afresh
,
and
*NL*
with
fresh
emotion
,
in
the
form
of
the
knowledge
offered
to
his
*NL*
colleague
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thousand
unuttered
thoughts
hummed
for
him
in
the
air
of
these
*NL*
observations
;
not
the
least
frequent
of
which
was
that
Sarah
might
well
*NL*
of
a
truth
not
quite
know
whither
she
was
drifting
.
She
was
in
no
*NL*
position
not
to
appear
to
expect
that
Chad
should
treat
her
handsomely
;
*NL*
yet
she
struck
our
friend
as
privately
stiffening
a
little
each
time
*NL*
she
missed
the
chance
of
marking
the
great
nuance
.
The
great
nuance
was
*NL*
in
brief
that
of
course
her
brother
must
treat
her
handsomely
--
she
*NL*
should
like
to
see
him
not
;
but
that
treating
her
handsomely
,
none
the
*NL*
less
,
was
n't
all
in
all
--
treating
her
handsomely
buttered
no
parsnips
;
*NL*
and
that
in
fine
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
the
fixed
eyes
of
*NL*
their
admirable
absent
mother
fairly
screw
into
the
flat
of
her
back
.
*NL*
Strether
,
watching
,
after
his
habit
,
and
overscoring
with
thought
,
*NL*
positively
had
moments
of
his
own
in
which
he
found
himself
sorry
for
*NL*
her
--
occasions
on
which
she
affected
him
as
a
person
seated
in
a
*NL*
runaway
vehicle
and
turning
over
the
question
of
a
possible
jump
.
WOULD
*NL*
she
jump
,
could
she
,
would
THAT
be
a
safe
placed
--
this
question
,
at
*NL*
such
instants
,
sat
for
him
in
her
lapse
into
pallor
,
her
tight
lips
,
*NL*
her
conscious
eyes
.
It
came
back
to
the
main
point
at
issue
:
would
she
*NL*
be
,
after
all
,
to
be
squared
?
He
believed
on
the
whole
she
would
jump
;
*NL*
yet
his
alternations
on
this
subject
were
the
more
especial
stuff
of
*NL*
his
suspense
.
One
thing
remained
well
before
him
--
a
conviction
that
*NL*
was
in
fact
to
gain
sharpness
from
the
impressions
of
this
evening
:
*NL*
that
if
she
SHOULD
gather
in
her
skirts
,
close
her
eyes
and
quit
the
*NL*
carriage
while
in
motion
,
he
would
promptly
enough
become
aware
.
She
*NL*
would
alight
from
her
headlong
course
more
or
less
directly
upon
him
;
*NL*
it
would
be
appointed
to
him
,
unquestionably
,
to
receive
her
entire
*NL*
weight
.
Signs
and
portents
of
the
experience
thus
in
reserve
for
him
*NL*
had
as
it
happened
,
multiplied
even
through
the
dazzle
of
Chad
's
party
.
*NL*
It
was
partly
under
the
nervous
consciousness
of
such
a
prospect
that
,
*NL*
leaving
almost
every
one
in
the
two
other
rooms
,
leaving
those
of
the
*NL*
guests
already
known
to
him
as
well
as
a
mass
of
brilliant
strangers
of
*NL*
both
sexes
and
of
several
varieties
of
speech
,
he
had
desired
five
*NL*
quiet
minutes
with
little
Bilham
,
whom
he
always
found
soothing
and
*NL*
even
a
little
inspiring
,
and
to
whom
he
had
actually
moreover
something
*NL*
distinct
and
important
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
felt
of
old
--
for
it
already
seemed
long
ago
--
rather
humiliated
*NL*
at
discovering
he
could
learn
in
talk
with
a
personage
so
much
his
*NL*
junior
the
lesson
of
a
certain
moral
ease
;
but
he
had
now
got
used
to
*NL*
that
--
whether
or
no
the
mixture
of
the
fact
with
other
humiliations
had
*NL*
made
it
indistinct
,
whether
or
no
directly
from
little
Bilham
's
*NL*
example
,
the
example
of
his
being
contentedly
just
the
obscure
and
*NL*
acute
little
Bilham
he
was
.
It
worked
so
for
him
,
Strether
seemed
to
*NL*
see
;
and
our
friend
had
at
private
hours
a
wan
smile
over
the
fact
that
*NL*
he
himself
,
after
so
many
more
years
,
was
still
in
search
of
something
*NL*
that
would
work
.
However
,
as
we
have
said
,
it
worked
just
now
for
them
*NL*
equally
to
have
found
a
corner
a
little
apart
.
What
particularly
kept
*NL*
it
apart
was
the
circumstance
that
the
music
in
the
salon
was
*NL*
admirable
,
with
two
or
three
such
singers
as
it
was
a
privilege
to
hear
*NL*
in
private
.
Their
presence
gave
a
distinction
to
Chad
's
entertainment
,
*NL*
and
the
interest
of
calculating
their
effect
on
Sarah
was
actually
so
*NL*
sharp
as
to
be
almost
painful
.
Unmistakeably
,
in
her
single
person
,
*NL*
the
motive
of
the
composition
and
dressed
in
a
splendour
of
crimson
*NL*
which
affected
Strether
as
the
sound
of
a
fall
through
a
skylight
,
she
*NL*
would
now
be
in
the
forefront
of
the
listening
circle
and
committed
by
*NL*
it
up
to
her
eyes
.
Those
eyes
during
the
wonderful
dinner
itself
he
*NL*
had
n't
once
met
;
having
confessedly
--
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
pusillanimously
--
arranged
with
Chad
that
he
should
be
on
the
same
side
*NL*
of
the
table
.
But
there
was
no
use
in
having
arrived
now
with
little
*NL*
Bilham
at
an
unprecedented
point
of
intimacy
unless
he
could
pitch
*NL*
everything
into
the
pot
.
``
You
who
sat
where
you
could
see
her
,
what
*NL*
does
she
make
of
it
all
?
By
which
I
mean
on
what
terms
does
she
take
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
she
takes
it
,
I
judge
,
as
proving
that
the
claim
of
his
family
is
*NL*
more
than
ever
justified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
then
pleased
with
what
he
has
to
show
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
;
she
's
pleased
with
it
as
with
his
capacity
to
do
this
*NL*
kind
of
thing
--
more
than
she
has
been
pleased
with
anything
for
a
long
*NL*
time
.
But
she
wants
him
to
show
it
THERE
.
He
has
no
right
to
waste
it
*NL*
on
the
likes
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
``
She
wants
him
to
move
the
whole
thing
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
thing
--
with
an
important
exception
.
Everything
he
has
*NL*
`
picked
up
'
--
and
the
way
he
knows
how
.
She
sees
no
difficulty
in
that
.
*NL*
She
'd
run
the
show
herself
,
and
she
'll
make
the
handsome
concession
*NL*
that
Woollett
would
be
on
the
whole
in
some
ways
the
better
for
it
.
Not
*NL*
that
it
would
n't
be
also
in
some
ways
the
better
for
Woollett
.
The
*NL*
people
there
are
just
as
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
good
as
you
and
these
others
?
Ah
that
may
be
.
But
such
an
*NL*
occasion
as
this
,
whether
or
no
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
is
n't
the
people
.
*NL*
It
's
what
has
made
the
people
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
his
friend
replied
,
``
there
you
are
;
I
give
you
my
*NL*
impression
for
what
it
's
worth
.
Mrs.
Pocock
has
SEEN
,
and
that
's
*NL*
to-night
how
she
sits
there
.
If
you
were
to
have
a
glimpse
of
her
face
*NL*
you
'd
understand
me
.
She
has
made
up
her
mind
--
to
the
sound
of
*NL*
expensive
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
it
freely
in
.
``
Ah
then
I
shall
have
news
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
frighten
you
,
but
I
think
that
likely
.
However
,
''
*NL*
little
Bilham
continued
,
``
if
I
'm
of
the
least
use
to
you
to
hold
on
*NL*
by
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
of
the
least
!
''
--
and
Strether
laid
an
appreciative
hand
on
*NL*
him
to
say
it
.
``
No
one
's
of
the
least
.
''
With
which
,
to
mark
how
gaily
*NL*
he
could
take
it
,
he
patted
his
companion
's
knee
.
``
I
must
meet
my
fate
*NL*
alone
,
and
I
SHALL
--
oh
you
'll
see
!
And
yet
,
''
he
pursued
the
next
*NL*
moment
,
``
you
CAN
help
me
too
.
You
once
said
to
me
''
--
he
followed
this
*NL*
further
--
``
that
you
held
Chad
should
marry
.
I
did
n't
see
then
so
well
as
*NL*
I
know
now
that
you
meant
he
should
marry
Miss
Pocock
.
Do
you
still
*NL*
consider
that
he
should
?
Because
if
you
do
''
--
he
kept
it
up
--
``
I
want
*NL*
you
immediately
to
change
your
mind
.
You
can
help
me
that
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
you
by
thinking
he
should
NOT
marry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Strether
returned
,
``
that
I
'm
not
obliged
to
say

But
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet

I
suggest

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
little
Bilham
with
some
sharpness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
precisely
!
But

need
n't

all

I

at
any

provide

case
I
rather

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
was
amused
.
``
Obliged
to
provide
for
my
marrying

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

after
all
I
've
done

*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
weighed
it
.
``
Have
you
done
as
much
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,

said
Strether
,
thus
challenged
,
``
of
course
I
must
remember
what
*NL*
you
've
also
done
to
ME

We
may
perhaps
call
it
square

But
all
the
*NL*
same
,

he
went
on
,
``
I
wish
awfully
you
'd
marry
Mamie
Pocock
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
laughed
out
.
``
Why
it
was
only
the
other
night
,
in
this
*NL*
very
place

that
you
were
proposing

different
union
altogether

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
de
Vionnet

''
Well
,
Strether
easily
confessed
it
.
``
That
,
*NL*
I
admit
,
was
a
vain
image

THIS
is
practical
politics

I
want
to
do

something
good
for
both
of
you

I
wish
you
each
so
well

you
can
*NL*
see
in
a
moment
the
trouble
it
will
save
me
to
polish
you
off
by
the
*NL*
same
stroke

She
likes
you
,
you
know
.
You
console
her

And
she
's
*NL*
splendid
.

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
stared
as
a
delicate
appetite
stares
at
an
overheaped
*NL*
plate
.
``
What
do
I
console
her
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
just
made
his
friend
impatient
.
``
Oh
come
,
you
knows

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
proves
for
you
that
she
likes
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
fact
that
I
found
her
three
days
ago
stopping
at
home
alone

all
the
golden
afternoon
on
the
mere
chance
that
you
'd
come
to
her
,

*NL*
hanging
over
her
balcony
on
that
of
seeing
your
cab
drive
up
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
you
want
more

*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
after
a
moment
found
it
.
``
Only
just
to
know
what
proves
*NL*
to
you
that
I
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

just
mentioned

a
stony-hearted
little
fiend

Besides

--
Strether
encouraged
his
*NL*
fancy
's
flight
--
``
you
showed
your
inclination
in
the
way

kept

cared
enough
for

*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
paid
his
ingenuity
the
deference
of
a
pause
.
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
keep

came
at

honourably
declared

*NL*
``

still

Strether

charmed

held
him
*NL*
the
faster
.

did

do
her
justice

he
*NL*
continued
,

and
our
friend
spoke
now
with
*NL*
a
yearning
that
was
really
earnest
--
``
at

to
have
done
THAT

off

Strether
went
on
,
``
to
have
been
at
least
to
that
extent
*NL*
constructive

expiatory
.
I
've
been
sacrificing
so
to
strange
gods
*NL*
that
I
feel
I
want
to
put
on
record
,
somehow
,
my
*NL*
fidelity
--
fundamentally
unchanged
after
all
--
to
our
own
.
I
feel
as
if
*NL*
my
hands
were
embrued
with
the
blood
of
monstrous
alien
altars
--
of
*NL*
another
faith
altogether
.
There
it
is
--
it
's
done
.
''
And
then
he
further
*NL*
explained
.
``
It
took
hold
of
me
because
the
idea
of
getting
her
quite
*NL*
out
of
the
way
for
Chad
helps
to
clear
my
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
at
this
,
bounced
about
,
and
it
brought
them
face
to
face
*NL*
in
admitted
amusement
.
``
You
want
me
to
marry
as
a
convenience
to
Chad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Strether
debated
--
``
HE
does
n't
care
whether
you
marry
or
not
.
It
's
*NL*
as
a
convenience
simply
to
my
own
plan
FOR
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Simply
'
!
''
--
and
little
Bilham
's
concurrence
was
in
itself
a
lively
*NL*
comment
.
``
Thank
you
.
But
I
thought
,
''
he
continued
,
``
you
had
exactly
*NL*
NO
plan
`
for
'
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
call
it
my
plan
for
myself
--
which
may
be
well
,
as
you
say
,
*NL*
to
have
none
.
His
situation
,
do
n't
you
see
?
is
reduced
now
to
the
bare
*NL*
facts
one
has
to
recognise
.
Mamie
does
n't
want
him
,
and
he
does
n't
*NL*
want
Mamie
:
so
much
as
that
these
days
have
made
clear
.
It
's
a
thread
*NL*
we
can
wind
up
and
tuck
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
little
Bilham
still
questioned
.
``
YOU
can
--
since
you
seem
so
much
*NL*
to
want
to
.
But
why
should
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Strether
thought
it
over
,
but
was
obliged
of
course
to
admit
that
*NL*
his
demonstration
did
superficially
fail
.
``
Seriously
,
there
is
no
*NL*
reason
.
It
's
my
affair
--
I
must
do
it
alone
.
I
've
only
my
fantastic
*NL*
need
of
making
my
dose
stiff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
wondered
.
``
What
do
you
call
your
dose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
what
I
have
to
swallow
.
I
want
my
conditions
unmitigated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
in
the
tone
of
talk
for
talk
's
sake
,
and
yet
with
an
*NL*
obscure
truth
lurking
in
the
loose
folds
;
a
circumstance
presently
not
*NL*
without
its
effect
on
his
young
friend
.
Little
Bilham
's
eyes
rested
on
*NL*
him
a
moment
with
some
intensity
;
then
suddenly
,
as
if
everything
had
*NL*
cleared
up
,
he
gave
a
happy
laugh
.
It
seemed
to
say
that
if
*NL*
pretending
,
or
even
trying
,
or
still
even
hoping
,
to
be
able
to
care
*NL*
for
Mamie
would
be
of
use
,
he
was
all
there
for
the
job
.
``
I
'll
do
*NL*
anything
in
the
world
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Strether
smiled
,
``
anything
in
the
world
is
all
I
want
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
anything
that
pleased
me
in
her
more
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
than
the
way
*NL*
that
,
on
my
finding
her
up
there
all
alone
,
coming
on
her
unawares
and
*NL*
feeling
greatly
for
her
being
so
out
of
it
,
she
knocked
down
my
tall
*NL*
house
of
cards
with
her
instant
and
cheerful
allusion
to
the
next
young
*NL*
man
.
It
was
somehow
so
the
note
I
needed
--
her
staying
at
home
to
*NL*
receive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Chad
of
course
,
''
said
little
Bilham
,
``
who
asked
the
next
young
*NL*
man
--
I
like
your
name
for
me
!
--
to
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
supposed
--
all
of
which
,
thank
God
,
is
in
our
innocent
and
natural
*NL*
manners
.
But
do
you
know
,
''
Strether
asked
,
``
if
Chad
knows
--
?
''
And
*NL*
then
as
this
interlocutor
seemed
at
a
loss
:
``
Why
where
she
has
come
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
,
at
this
,
met
his
face
with
a
conscious
look
--
it
was
as
*NL*
if
,
more
than
anything
yet
,
the
allusion
had
penetrated
.
``
Do
you
know
*NL*
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
lightly
shook
his
head
.
``
There
I
stop
.
Oh
,
odd
as
it
may
*NL*
appear
to
you
,
there
ARE
things
I
do
n't
know
.
I
only
got
the
sense
*NL*
from
her
of
something
very
sharp
,
and
yet
very
deep
down
,
that
she
was
*NL*
keeping
all
to
herself
.
That
is
I
had
begun
with
the
belief
that
she
*NL*
HAD
kept
it
to
herself
;
but
face
to
face
with
her
there
I
soon
made
out
*NL*
that
there
was
a
person
with
whom
she
would
have
shared
it
.
I
had
*NL*
thought
she
possibly
might
with
ME
--
but
I
saw
then
that
I
was
only
half
*NL*
in
her
confidence
.
When
,
turning
to
me
to
greet
me
--
for
she
was
on
the
*NL*
balcony
and
I
had
come
in
without
her
knowing
it
--
she
showed
me
she
had
*NL*
been
expecting
YOU
and
was
proportionately
disappointed
,
I
got
hold
of
*NL*
the
tail
of
my
conviction
.
Half
an
hour
later
I
was
in
possession
of
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
it
.
You
know
what
has
happened
.
''
He
looked
at
his
*NL*
young
friend
hard
--
then
he
felt
sure
.
``
For
all
you
say
,
you
're
up
to
*NL*
your
eyes
.
So
there
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
after
an
instant
pulled
half
round
.
``
I
assure
you
she
*NL*
has
n't
told
me
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
has
n't
.
For
what
do
you
suggest
that
I
suppose
her
to
*NL*
take
you
?
But
you
've
been
with
her
every
day
,
you
've
seen
her
freely
,
*NL*
you
've
liked
her
greatly
--
I
stick
to
that
--
and
you
've
made
your
profit
*NL*
of
it
.
You
know
what
she
has
been
through
as
well
as
you
know
that
she
*NL*
has
dined
here
to-night
--
which
must
have
put
her
,
by
the
way
,
through
a
*NL*
good
deal
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
faced
this
blast
;
after
which
he
pulled
round
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
way
.
``
I
have
n't
in
the
least
said
she
has
n't
been
nice
to
me
.
But
*NL*
she
's
proud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
quite
properly
.
But
not
too
proud
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
her
pride
that
has
made
her
.
Chad
,
''
little
Bilham
loyally
*NL*
went
on
,
``
has
really
been
as
kind
to
her
as
possible
.
It
's
awkward
for
*NL*
a
man
when
a
girl
's
in
love
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
she
is
n't
--
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
sat
staring
before
him
;
then
he
sprang
up
as
if
his
*NL*
friend
's
penetration
,
recurrent
and
insistent
,
made
him
really
after
*NL*
all
too
nervous
.
``
No
--
she
is
n't
now
.
It
is
n't
in
the
least
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
``
Chad
's
fault
.
He
's
really
all
right
.
I
mean
he
would
have
been
*NL*
willing
.
But
she
came
over
with
ideas
.
Those
she
had
got
at
home
.
*NL*
They
had
been
her
motive
and
support
in
joining
her
brother
and
his
*NL*
wife
.
She
was
to
SAVE
our
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
like
me
,
poor
thing
?
''
Strether
also
got
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
--
she
had
a
bad
moment
.
It
was
very
soon
distinct
to
her
,
to
*NL*
pull
her
up
,
to
let
her
down
,
that
,
alas
,
he
was
,
he
IS
,
saved
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
left
for
her
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
to
love
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
have
loved
him
better
as
she
originally
believed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
``
Of
course
one
asks
one
's
self
what
notion
a
little
*NL*
girl
forms
,
where
a
young
man
's
in
question
,
of
such
a
history
and
such
*NL*
a
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
little
girl
saw
them
,
no
doubt
,
as
obscure
,
but
she
saw
*NL*
them
practically
as
wrong
.
The
wrong
for
her
WAS
the
obscure
.
Chad
*NL*
turns
out
at
any
rate
right
and
good
and
disconcerting
,
while
what
she
*NL*
was
all
prepared
for
,
primed
and
girded
and
wound
up
for
,
was
to
deal
*NL*
with
him
as
the
general
opposite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
was
n't
her
whole
point
''
--
Strether
weighed
it
--
``
that
he
was
to
be
,
*NL*
that
he
COULD
be
,
made
better
,
redeemed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
fixed
it
all
a
moment
,
and
then
with
a
small
headshake
*NL*
that
diffused
a
tenderness
:
``
She
's
too
late
.
Too
late
for
the
*NL*
miracle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
''
--
his
companion
saw
enough
.
``
Still
,
if
the
worst
fault
of
his
*NL*
condition
is
that
it
may
be
all
there
for
her
to
profit
by
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
she
does
n't
want
to
`
profit
,
'
in
that
flat
way
.
She
does
n't
want
*NL*
to
profit
by
another
woman
's
work
--
she
wants
the
miracle
to
have
been
*NL*
her
own
miracle
.
THAT
'S
what
she
's
too
late
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
quite
felt
how
it
all
fitted
,
yet
there
seemed
one
loose
*NL*
piece
.
``
I
'm
bound
to
say
,
you
know
,
that
she
strikes
one
,
on
these
*NL*
lines
,
as
fastidious
--
what
you
call
here
difficile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Bilham
tossed
up
his
chin
.
``
Of
course
she
's
difficile
--
on
any
*NL*
lines
!
What
else
in
the
world
ARE
our
Mamies
--
the
real
,
the
right
*NL*
ones
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
I
see
,
''
our
friend
repeated
,
charmed
by
the
responsive
wisdom
*NL*
he
had
ended
by
so
richly
extracting
.
``
Mamie
is
one
of
the
real
and
*NL*
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
thing
itself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
it
comes
to
then
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
``
is
that
poor
awful
Chad
*NL*
is
simply
too
good
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
too
good
was
what
he
was
after
all
to
be
;
but
it
was
she
herself
,
*NL*
and
she
herself
only
,
who
was
to
have
made
him
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
hung
beautifully
together
,
but
with
still
a
loose
end
.
``
Would
n't
he
*NL*
do
for
her
even
if
he
should
after
all
break
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
his
actual
influence
?
''
Oh
little
Bilham
had
for
this
enquiry
the
*NL*
sharpest
of
all
his
controls
.
``
How
can
he
`
do
'
--
on
any
terms
*NL*
whatever
--
when
he
's
flagrantly
spoiled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
could
only
meet
the
question
with
his
passive
,
his
receptive
*NL*
pleasure
.
``
Well
,
thank
goodness
,
YOU
'RE
not
!
You
remain
for
her
to
*NL*
save
,
and
I
come
back
,
on
so
beautiful
and
full
a
demonstration
,
to
my
*NL*
contention
of
just
now
--
that
of
your
showing
distinct
signs
of
her
*NL*
having
already
begun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
he
could
further
say
to
himself
--
as
his
young
friend
turned
*NL*
away
--
was
that
the
charge
encountered
for
the
moment
no
renewed
denial
.
*NL*
Little
Bilham
,
taking
his
course
back
to
the
music
,
only
shook
his
*NL*
good-natured
ears
an
instant
,
in
the
manner
of
a
terrier
who
has
got
*NL*
wet
;
while
Strether
relapsed
into
the
sense
--
which
had
for
him
in
these
*NL*
days
most
of
comfort
--
that
he
was
free
to
believe
in
anything
that
from
*NL*
hour
to
hour
kept
him
going
.
He
had
positively
motions
and
flutters
of
*NL*
this
conscious
hour-to-hour
kind
,
temporary
surrenders
to
irony
,
to
*NL*
fancy
,
frequent
instinctive
snatches
at
the
growing
rose
of
*NL*
observation
,
constantly
stronger
for
him
,
as
he
felt
,
in
scent
and
*NL*
colour
,
and
in
which
he
could
bury
his
nose
even
to
wantonness
.
This
*NL*
last
resource
was
offered
him
,
for
that
matter
,
in
the
very
form
of
his
*NL*
next
clear
perception
--
the
vision
of
a
prompt
meeting
,
in
the
doorway
*NL*
of
the
room
,
between
little
Bilham
and
brilliant
Miss
Barrace
,
who
was
*NL*
entering
as
Bilham
withdrew
.
She
had
apparently
put
him
a
question
,
to
*NL*
which
he
had
replied
by
turning
to
indicate
his
late
interlocutor
;
*NL*
toward
whom
,
after
an
interrogation
further
aided
by
a
resort
to
that
*NL*
optical
machinery
which
seemed
,
like
her
other
ornaments
,
curious
and
*NL*
archaic
,
the
genial
lady
,
suggesting
more
than
ever
for
her
fellow
*NL*
guest
the
old
French
print
,
the
historic
portrait
,
directed
herself
*NL*
with
an
intention
that
Strether
instantly
met
.
He
knew
in
advance
the
*NL*
first
note
she
would
sound
,
and
took
in
as
she
approached
all
her
need
*NL*
of
sounding
it
.
Nothing
yet
had
been
so
``
wonderful
''
between
them
as
*NL*
the
present
occasion
;
and
it
was
her
special
sense
of
this
quality
in
*NL*
occasions
that
she
was
there
,
as
she
was
in
most
places
,
to
feed
.
That
*NL*
sense
had
already
been
so
well
fed
by
the
situation
about
them
that
she
*NL*
had
quitted
the
other
room
,
forsaken
the
music
,
dropped
out
of
the
*NL*
play
,
abandoned
,
in
a
word
,
the
stage
itself
,
that
she
might
stand
a
*NL*
minute
behind
the
scenes
with
Strether
and
so
perhaps
figure
as
one
of
*NL*
the
famous
augurs
replying
,
behind
the
oracle
,
to
the
wink
of
the
*NL*
other
.
Seated
near
him
presently
where
little
Bilham
had
sat
,
she
*NL*
replied
in
truth
to
many
things
;
beginning
as
soon
as
he
had
said
to
*NL*
her
--
what
he
hoped
he
said
without
fatuity
--
``
All
you
ladies
are
*NL*
extraordinarily
kind
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
her
long
handle
,
which
shifted
her
observation
;
she
saw
in
*NL*
an
instant
all
the
absences
that
left
them
free
.
``
How
can
we
be
*NL*
anything
else
?
But
is
n't
that
exactly
your
plight
?
`
We
ladies
'
--
oh
*NL*
we
're
nice
,
and
you
must
be
having
enough
of
us
!
As
one
of
us
,
you
*NL*
know
,
I
do
n't
pretend
I
'm
crazy
about
us
.
But
Miss
Gostrey
at
least
*NL*
to-night
has
left
you
alone
,
has
n't
she
?
''
With
which
she
again
looked
*NL*
about
as
if
Maria
might
still
lurk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Strether
;
``
she
's
only
sitting
up
for
me
at
home
.
''
And
*NL*
then
as
this
elicited
from
his
companion
her
gay
``
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
''
he
*NL*
explained
that
he
meant
sitting
up
in
suspense
and
prayer
.
``
We
thought
*NL*
it
on
the
whole
better
she
should
n't
be
present
;
and
either
way
of
*NL*
course
it
's
a
terrible
worry
for
her
.
''
He
abounded
in
the
sense
of
his
*NL*
appeal
to
the
ladies
,
and
they
might
take
their
choice
of
his
doing
so
*NL*
from
humility
or
from
pride
.
``
Yet
she
inclines
to
believe
I
shall
come
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
incline
to
believe
too
you
'll
come
out
!
''
--
Miss
Barrace
,
with
her
*NL*
laugh
,
was
not
to
be
behind
.
``
Only
the
question
's
about
WHERE
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
However
,
''
she
happily
continued
,
``
if
it
's
anywhere
at
all
it
must
*NL*
be
very
far
on
,
must
n't
it
?
To
do
us
justice
,
I
think
,
you
know
,
''
she
*NL*
laughed
,
``
we
do
,
among
us
all
,
want
you
rather
far
on
.
Yes
,
yes
,
''
she
*NL*
repeated
in
her
quick
droll
way
;
``
we
want
you
very
,
VERY
far
on
!
''
After
*NL*
which
she
wished
to
know
why
he
had
thought
it
better
Maria
should
n't
*NL*
be
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
replied
,
``
it
was
really
her
own
idea
.
I
should
have
wished
*NL*
it
.
But
she
dreads
responsibility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
n't
that
a
new
thing
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
dread
it
?
No
doubt
--
no
doubt
.
But
her
nerve
has
given
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
She
has
too
much
at
stake
.
''
Then
*NL*
less
gravely
:
``
Mine
,
luckily
for
me
,
holds
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckily
for
me
too
''
--
Strether
came
back
to
that
.
``
My
own
is
n't
so
*NL*
firm
,
MY
appetite
for
responsibility
is
n't
so
sharp
,
as
that
I
have
n't
*NL*
felt
the
very
principle
of
this
occasion
to
be
`
the
more
the
merrier
.
'
*NL*
If
we
ARE
so
merry
it
's
because
Chad
has
understood
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
understood
amazingly
,
''
said
Miss
Barrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
--
Strether
anticipated
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
!
''
she
,
to
meet
it
,
intensified
;
so
that
,
face
to
face
*NL*
over
it
,
they
largely
and
recklessly
laughed
.
But
she
presently
added
:
*NL*
``
Oh
I
see
the
principle
.
If
one
did
n't
one
would
be
lost
.
But
when
*NL*
once
one
has
got
hold
of
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
simple
as
twice
two
!
From
the
moment
he
had
to
do
something
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
crowd
''
--
she
took
him
straight
up
--
``
was
the
only
thing
?
Rather
,
*NL*
rather
:
a
rumpus
of
sound
,
''
she
laughed
,
``
or
nothing
.
Mrs.
Pocock
's
*NL*
built
in
,
or
built
out
--
whichever
you
call
it
;
she
's
packed
so
tight
*NL*
she
ca
n't
move
.
She
's
in
splendid
isolation
''
--
Miss
Barrace
embroidered
*NL*
the
theme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
followed
,
but
scrupulous
of
justice
.
``
Yet
with
every
one
in
*NL*
the
place
successively
introduced
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderfully
--
but
just
so
that
it
does
build
her
out
.
She
's
bricked
*NL*
up
,
she
's
buried
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
for
a
moment
to
look
at
it
;
but
it
brought
him
to
a
*NL*
sigh
.
``
Oh
but
she
's
not
dead
!
It
will
take
more
than
this
to
kill
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
had
a
pause
that
might
have
been
for
pity
.
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
pretend
I
think
she
's
finished
--
or
that
it
's
for
more
than
to-night
.
''
*NL*
She
remained
pensive
as
if
with
the
same
compunction
.
``
It
's
only
up
to
*NL*
her
chin
.
''
Then
again
for
the
fun
of
it
:
``
She
can
breathe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
breathe
!
''
--
he
echoed
it
in
the
same
spirit
.
``
And
do
you
*NL*
know
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
what
's
really
all
this
time
happening
to
*NL*
me
?
--
through
the
beauty
of
music
,
the
gaiety
of
voices
,
the
uproar
in
*NL*
short
of
our
revel
and
the
felicity
of
your
wit
?
The
sound
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
's
respiration
drowns
for
me
,
I
assure
you
,
every
other
.
It
's
*NL*
literally
all
I
hear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
focussed
him
with
her
clink
of
chains
.
``
Well
--
!
''
she
breathed
ever
*NL*
so
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
IS
free
from
her
chin
up
,
''
she
mused
;
``
and
that
WILL
be
enough
for
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
enough
for
me
!
''
Strether
ruefully
laughed
.
``
Waymarsh
has
*NL*
really
,
''
he
then
asked
,
``
brought
her
to
see
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
that
's
the
worst
of
it
.
I
could
do
you
no
good
.
And
yet
I
*NL*
tried
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
``
And
how
did
you
try
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
did
n't
speak
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
That
was
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
would
have
been
worse
?
For
speaking
or
silent
,
''
she
lightly
*NL*
wailed
,
``
I
somehow
`
compromise
.
'
And
it
has
never
been
any
one
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
shows
''
--
he
was
magnanimous
--
``
that
it
's
something
not
in
you
,
but
*NL*
in
one
's
self
.
It
's
MY
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
a
little
.
``
No
,
it
's
Mr.
Waymarsh
's
.
It
's
the
fault
of
*NL*
his
having
brought
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
said
Strether
good-naturedly
,
``
why
DID
he
bring
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
n't
afford
not
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
were
a
trophy
--
one
of
the
spoils
of
conquest
?
But
why
in
that
*NL*
case
,
since
you
do
`
compromise
'
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
compromise
HIM
as
well
?
I
do
compromise
him
as
well
,
''
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
smiled
.
``
I
compromise
him
as
hard
as
I
can
.
But
for
Mr.
*NL*
Waymarsh
it
is
n't
fatal
.
It
's
--
so
far
as
his
wonderful
relation
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocock
is
concerned
--
favourable
.
''
And
then
,
as
he
still
seemed
*NL*
slightly
at
sea
:
``
The
man
who
had
succeeded
with
ME
,
do
n't
you
see
?
*NL*
For
her
to
get
him
from
me
was
such
an
added
incentive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
saw
,
but
as
if
his
path
was
still
strewn
with
surprises
.
``
It
's
*NL*
`
from
'
you
then
that
she
has
got
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
amused
at
his
momentary
muddle
.
``
You
can
fancy
my
fight
!
She
*NL*
believes
in
her
triumph
.
I
think
it
has
been
part
of
her
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
her
joy
!
''
Strether
sceptically
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
thinks
she
has
had
her
own
way
.
And
what
's
to-night
for
her
*NL*
but
a
kind
of
apotheosis
?
Her
frock
's
really
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
enough
to
go
to
heaven
in
?
For
after
a
real
apotheosis
,
''
*NL*
Strether
went
on
,
``
there
's
nothing
BUT
heaven
.
For
Sarah
there
's
only
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
that
she
wo
n't
find
to-morrow
heavenly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
mean
that
I
somehow
feel
to-night
--
on
her
behalf
--
too
good
to
*NL*
be
true
.
She
has
had
her
cake
;
that
is
she
's
in
the
act
now
of
having
*NL*
it
,
of
swallowing
the
largest
and
sweetest
piece
.
There
wo
n't
be
*NL*
another
left
for
her
.
Certainly
I
have
n't
one
.
It
can
only
,
at
the
*NL*
best
,
be
Chad
.
''
He
continued
to
make
it
out
as
for
their
common
*NL*
entertainment
.
``
He
may
have
one
,
as
it
were
,
up
his
sleeve
;
yet
it
's
*NL*
borne
in
upon
me
that
if
he
had
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
''
--
she
quite
understood
--
``
have
taken
all
THIS
trouble

I
*NL*
dare
say
not
,
and
,
if
I
may
be
quite
free
and
dreadful
,
I
very
much
*NL*
hope
he
wo
n't
take
any
more
.
Of
course
I
wo
n't
pretend
now
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
``
not
to
know
what
it
's
a
question
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
every
one
must
know
now
,
''
poor
Strether
thoughtfully
admitted
;
``
and
*NL*
it
's
strange
enough
and
funny
enough
that
one
should
feel
everybody
*NL*
here
at
this
very
moment
to
be
knowing
and
watching
and
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
is
n't
it
indeed
funny
?
''
Miss
Barrace
quite
rose
to
it
.
``
That
's
*NL*
the
way
we
ARE
in
Paris
.
''
She
was
always
pleased
with
a
new
*NL*
contribution
to
that
queerness
.
``
It
's
wonderful
!
But
,
you
know
,
''
she
*NL*
declared
,
``
it
all
depends
on
you
.
I
do
n't
want
to
turn
the
knife
in
*NL*
your
vitals
,
but
that
's
naturally
what
you
just
now
meant
by
our
all
*NL*
being
on
top
of
you
.
We
know
you
as
the
hero
of
the
drama
,
and
we
're
*NL*
gathered
to
see
what
you
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
looked
at
her
a
moment
with
a
light
perhaps
slightly
obscured
.
*NL*
``
I
think
that
must
be
why
the
hero
has
taken
refuge
in
this
corner
.
*NL*
He
's
scared
at
his
heroism
--
he
shrinks
from
his
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
we
nevertheless
believe
he
'll
play
it
.
That
's
why
,
''
Miss
*NL*
Barrace
kindly
went
on
,
``
we
take
such
an
interest
in
you
.
We
feel
*NL*
you
'll
come
up
to
the
scratch
.
''
And
then
as
he
seemed
perhaps
not
quite
*NL*
to
take
fire
:
``
Do
n't
let
him
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
Chad
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
keep
hold
of
him
.
With
all
this
''
--
and
she
indicated
the
general
*NL*
tribute
--
``
he
has
done
enough
.
We
love
him
here
--
he
's
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
beautiful
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
the
way
you
all
can
simplify
when
you
*NL*
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
gave
it
to
him
back
.
``
It
's
nothing
to
the
way
you
will
when
*NL*
you
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
winced
at
it
as
at
the
very
voice
of
prophecy
,
and
it
kept
him
a
*NL*
moment
quiet
.
He
detained
her
,
however
,
on
her
appearing
about
to
*NL*
leave
him
alone
in
the
rather
cold
clearance
their
talk
had
made
.
*NL*
``
There
positively
is
n't
a
sign
of
a
hero
to-night
;
the
hero
's
dodging
*NL*
and
shirking
,
the
hero
's
ashamed
.
Therefore
,
you
know
,
I
think
,
what
*NL*
you
must
all
REALLY
be
occupied
with
is
the
heroine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Barrace
took
a
minute
.
``
The
heroine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heroine

I
've
treated
her

''
said
Strether
,
``
not
a
bit
like
a
*NL*
hero

Oh
,
''
he
sighed
,
``
I
do
n't
do
it
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
eased
him
off
.
``
You
do
it
as
you
can
.
''
And
then
after
another
*NL*
hesitation
:
``
I
think
she
's
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
remained
compunctious
.
``
I
have
n't
been
near
her

I
have
n't
*NL*
looked
at
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
you
've
lost
a
good
deal
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
he
knew
it

``
She
's
more
wonderful
than
ever
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Than
ever

With

Strether
wondered

*NL*
``
Madame

Miss
Barrace
was
historic

``

what
's
she
doing
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
you
must
ask
HIM
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
face
lighted
again
at
the
prospect
.
``
It
WILL
be
amusing
to
*NL*
do
so
.
''
Yet
he
continued
to
wonder
.
``
But
she
must
have
some
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
has
--
she
has
twenty
ideas
.
She
has
in
the
first
place
,
''
*NL*
said
Miss
Barrace
,
swinging
a
little
her
tortoise-shell
,
``
that
of
doing
*NL*
her
part
.
Her
part
is
to
help
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
out
as
nothing
had
come
yet
;
links
were
missing
and
connexions
*NL*
unnamed
,
but
it
was
suddenly
as
if
they
were
at
the
heart
of
their
*NL*
subject
.
``
Yes
;
how
much
more
she
does
it
,
''
Strether
gravely
reflected
,
*NL*
``
than
I
help
HER
!
''
It
all
came
over
him
as
with
the
near
presence
of
*NL*
the
beauty
,
the
grace
,
the
intense
,
dissimulated
spirit
with
which
he
*NL*
had
,
as
he
said
,
been
putting
off
contact
.
``
SHE
has
courage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
she
has
courage
!
''
Miss
Barrace
quite
agreed
;
and
it
was
as
if
for
a
*NL*
moment
they
saw
the
quantity
in
each
other
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
indeed
the
whole
thing
was
present
.
``
How
much
she
must
care
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
there
it
is
.
She
does
care
.
But
it
is
n't
,
is
it
,
''
Miss
Barrace
*NL*
considerately
added
,
``
as
if
you
had
ever
had
any
doubt
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
suddenly
to
like
to
feel
that
he
really
never
had
.
``
Why
*NL*
of
course
it
's
the
whole
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voila
!
''
Miss
Barrace
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
why
one
came
out
,
''
Strether
went
on
.
``
And
it
's
why
one
has
*NL*
stayed
so
long
.
And
it
's
also
''
--
he
abounded
--
``
why
one
's
going
home
.
*NL*
It
's
why
,
it
's
why
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
why
everything
!
''
she
concurred
.
``
It
's
why
she
might
be
*NL*
to-night
--
for
all
she
looks
and
shows
,
and
for
all
your
friend
`
Jim
'
*NL*
does
--
about
twenty
years
old
.
That
's
another
of
her
ideas
;
to
be
for
*NL*
him
,
and
to
be
quite
easily
and
charmingly
,
as
young
as
a
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
assisted
at
his
distance
.
''
`
For
him
'
?
For
Chad
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Chad
,
in
a
manner
,
naturally
,
always
.
But
in
particular
to-night
*NL*
for
Mr.
Pocock
.
''
And
then
as
her
friend
still
stared
:
``
Yes
,
it
IS
of
*NL*
a
bravery
But
that
's
what
she
has
:
her
high
sense
of
duty
.
''
It
was
*NL*
more
than
sufficiently
before
them
.
``
When
Mr.
Newsome
has
his
hands
so
*NL*
embarrassed
with
his
sister
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
the
least
''
--
Strether
filled
it
out
--
``
that
she
should
take
*NL*
his
sister
's
husband
?
Certainly
--
quite
the
least
.
So
she
has
taken
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
taken
him
.
''
It
was
all
Miss
Barrace
had
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
it
remained
enough
.
``
It
must
be
funny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
it
IS
funny
.
''
That
of
course
essentially
went
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
brought
them
back
.
``
How
indeed
then
she
must
care
!
''
In
answer
to
*NL*
which
Strether
's
entertainer
dropped
a
comprehensive
``
Ah
!
''
expressive
*NL*
perhaps
of
some
impatience
for
the
time
he
took
to
get
used
to
it
.
She
*NL*
herself
had
got
used
to
it
long
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
morning
within
the
week
he
perceived
the
whole
thing
to
be
*NL*
really
at
last
upon
him
Strether
's
immediate
feeling
was
all
relief
.
He
*NL*
had
known
this
morning
that
something
was
about
to
happen
--
known
it
,
in
*NL*
a
moment
,
by
Waymarsh
's
manner
when
Waymarsh
appeared
before
him
during
*NL*
his
brief
consumption
of
coffee
and
a
roll
in
the
small
slippery
*NL*
salle-a-manger
so
associated
with
rich
rumination
.
Strether
had
taken
*NL*
there
of
late
various
lonely
and
absent-minded
meals
;
he
communed
*NL*
there
,
even
at
the
end
of
June
,
with
a
suspected
chill
,
the
air
of
old
*NL*
shivers
mixed
with
old
savours
,
the
air
in
which
so
many
of
his
*NL*
impressions
had
perversely
matured
;
the
place
meanwhile
renewing
its
*NL*
message
to
him
by
the
very
circumstance
of
his
single
state
.
He
now
*NL*
sat
there
,
for
the
most
part
,
to
sigh
softly
,
while
he
vaguely
tilted
*NL*
his
carafe
,
over
the
vision
of
how
much
better
Waymarsh
was
occupied
.
*NL*
That
was
really
his
success
by
the
common
measure
--
to
have
led
this
*NL*
companion
so
on
and
on
.
He
remembered
how
at
first
there
had
been
*NL*
scarce
a
squatting-place
he
could
beguile
him
into
passing
;
the
actual
*NL*
outcome
of
which
at
last
was
that
there
was
scarce
one
that
could
*NL*
arrest
him
in
his
rush
.
His
rush
--
as
Strether
vividly
and
amusedly
*NL*
figured
it
--
continued
to
be
all
with
Sarah
,
and
contained
perhaps
*NL*
moreover
the
word
of
the
whole
enigma
,
whipping
up
in
its
fine
*NL*
full-flavoured
froth
the
very
principle
,
for
good
or
for
ill
,
of
his
*NL*
own
,
of
Strether
's
destiny
.
It
might
after
all
,
to
the
end
,
only
be
*NL*
that
they
had
united
to
save
him
,
and
indeed
,
so
far
as
Waymarsh
was
*NL*
concerned
,
that
HAD
to
be
the
spring
of
action
.
Strether
was
glad
at
*NL*
all
events
,
in
connexion
with
the
case
,
that
the
saving
he
required
was
*NL*
not
more
scant
;
so
constituted
a
luxury
was
it
in
certain
lights
just
*NL*
to
lurk
there
out
of
the
full
glare
.
He
had
moments
of
quite
seriously
*NL*
wondering
whether
Waymarsh
would
n't
in
fact
,
thanks
to
old
friendship
*NL*
and
a
conceivable
indulgence
,
make
about
as
good
terms
for
him
as
he
*NL*
might
make
for
himself
.
They
would
n't
be
the
same
terms
of
course
;
but
*NL*
they
might
have
the
advantage
that
he
himself
probably
should
be
able
*NL*
to
make
none
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
never
in
the
morning
very
late
,
but
Waymarsh
had
already
been
*NL*
out
,
and
,
after
a
peep
into
the
dim
refectory
,
he
presented
himself
*NL*
with
much
less
than
usual
of
his
large
looseness
.
He
had
made
sure
,
*NL*
through
the
expanse
of
glass
exposed
to
the
court
,
that
they
would
be
*NL*
alone
;
and
there
was
now
in
fact
that
about
him
that
pretty
well
took
*NL*
up
the
room
.
He
was
dressed
in
the
garments
of
summer
;
and
save
that
*NL*
his
white
waistcoat
was
redundant
and
bulging
these
things
favoured
,
*NL*
they
determined
,
his
expression
.
He
wore
a
straw
hat
such
as
his
*NL*
friend
had
n't
yet
seen
in
Paris
,
and
he
showed
a
buttonhole
freshly
*NL*
adorned
with
a
magnificent
rose
.
Strether
read
on
the
instant
his
*NL*
story
--
how
,
astir
for
the
previous
hour
,
the
sprinkled
newness
of
the
*NL*
day
,
so
pleasant
at
that
season
in
Paris
,
he
was
fairly
panting
with
*NL*
the
pulse
of
adventure
and
had
been
with
Mrs.
Pocock
,
unmistakeably
,
to
*NL*
the
Marche
aux
Fleurs
.
Strether
really
knew
in
this
vision
of
him
a
joy
*NL*
that
was
akin
to
envy
;
so
reversed
as
he
stood
there
did
their
old
*NL*
positions
seem
;
so
comparatively
doleful
now
showed
,
by
the
sharp
turn
*NL*
of
the
wheel
,
the
posture
of
the
pilgrim
from
Woollett
.
He
wondered
,
*NL*
this
pilgrim
,
if
he
had
originally
looked
to
Waymarsh
so
brave
and
*NL*
well
,
so
remarkably
launched
,
as
it
was
at
present
the
latter
's
*NL*
privilege
to
appear
.
He
recalled
that
his
friend
had
remarked
to
him
*NL*
even
at
Chester
that
his
aspect
belied
his
plea
of
prostration
;
but
*NL*
there
certainly
could
n't
have
been
,
for
an
issue
,
an
aspect
less
*NL*
concerned
than
Waymarsh
's
with
the
menace
of
decay
.
Strether
had
at
*NL*
any
rate
never
resembled
a
Southern
planter
of
the
great
days
--
which
*NL*
was
the
image
picturesquely
suggested
by
the
happy
relation
between
the
*NL*
fuliginous
face
and
the
wide
panama
of
his
visitor
.
This
type
,
it
*NL*
further
amused
him
to
guess
,
had
been
,
on
Waymarsh
's
part
,
the
object
*NL*
of
Sarah
's
care
;
he
was
convinced
that
her
taste
had
not
been
a
*NL*
stranger
to
the
conception
and
purchase
of
the
hat
,
any
more
than
her
*NL*
fine
fingers
had
been
guiltless
of
the
bestowal
of
the
rose
.
It
came
*NL*
to
him
in
the
current
of
thought
,
as
things
so
oddly
did
come
,
that
HE
*NL*
had
never
risen
with
the
lark
to
attend
a
brilliant
woman
to
the
Marche
*NL*
aux
Fleurs
;
this
could
be
fastened
on
him
in
connexion
neither
with
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
nor
with
Madame
de
Vionnet
;
the
practice
of
getting
up
*NL*
early
for
adventures
could
indeed
in
no
manner
be
fastened
on
him
.
It
*NL*
came
to
him
in
fact
that
just
here
was
his
usual
case
:
he
was
for
ever
*NL*
missing
things
through
his
general
genius
for
missing
them
,
while
*NL*
others
were
for
ever
picking
them
up
through
a
contrary
bent
.
And
it
*NL*
was
others
who
looked
abstemious
and
he
who
looked
greedy
;
it
was
he
*NL*
somehow
who
finally
paid
,
and
it
was
others
who
mainly
partook
.
Yes
,
*NL*
he
should
go
to
the
scaffold
yet
for
he
would
n't
know
quite
whom
.
He
*NL*
almost
,
for
that
matter
,
felt
on
the
scaffold
now
and
really
quite
*NL*
enjoying
it
.
It
worked
out
as
BECAUSE
he
was
anxious
there
--
it
worked
*NL*
out
as
for
this
reason
that
Waymarsh
was
so
blooming
.
It
was
HIS
trip
*NL*
for
health
,
for
a
change
,
that
proved
the
success
--
which
was
just
what
*NL*
Strether
,
planning
and
exerting
himself
,
had
desired
it
should
be
.
That
*NL*
truth
already
sat
full-blown
on
his
companion
's
lips
;
benevolence
*NL*
breathed
from
them
as
with
the
warmth
of
active
exercise
,
and
also
a
*NL*
little
as
with
the
bustle
of
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Pocock
,
whom
I
left
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
at
her
hotel
,
has
*NL*
asked
me
to
mention
to
you
that
she
would
like
to
find
you
at
home
here
*NL*
in
about
another
hour
.
She
wants
to
see
you
;
she
has
something
to
*NL*
say
--
or
considers
,
I
believe
,
that
you
may
have
:
so
that
I
asked
her
*NL*
myself
why
she
should
n't
come
right
round
.
She
has
n't
BEEN
round
*NL*
yet
--
to
see
our
place
;
and
I
took
upon
myself
to
say
that
I
was
sure
*NL*
you
'd
be
glad
to
have
her
.
The
thing
's
therefore
,
you
see
,
to
keep
*NL*
right
here
till
she
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
announcement
was
sociably
,
even
though
,
after
Waymarsh
's
wont
,
*NL*
somewhat
solemnly
made
;
but
Strether
quickly
felt
other
things
in
it
*NL*
than
these
light
features
.
It
was
the
first
approach
,
from
that
*NL*
quarter
,
to
admitted
consciousness
;
it
quickened
his
pulse
;
it
simply
*NL*
meant
at
last
that
he
should
have
but
himself
to
thank
if
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
where
he
was
.
He
had
finished
his
breakfast
;
he
pushed
it
away
*NL*
and
was
on
his
feet
.
There
were
plenty
of
elements
of
surprise
,
but
*NL*
only
one
of
doubt
.
``
The
thing
's
for
YOU
to
keep
here
too
?
''
Waymarsh
*NL*
had
been
slightly
ambiguous
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
n't
ambiguous
,
however
,
after
this
enquiry
;
and
Strether
's
*NL*
understanding
had
probably
never
before
opened
so
wide
and
effective
a
*NL*
mouth
as
it
was
to
open
during
the
next
five
minutes
.
It
was
no
part
of
*NL*
his
friend
's
wish
,
as
appeared
,
to
help
to
receive
Mrs.
Pocock
;
he
*NL*
quite
understood
the
spirit
in
which
she
was
to
present
herself
,
but
*NL*
his
connexion
with
her
visit
was
limited
to
his
having
--
well
,
as
he
*NL*
might
say
--
perhaps
a
little
promoted
it
.
He
had
thought
,
and
had
let
*NL*
her
know
it
,
that
Strether
possibly
would
think
she
might
have
been
*NL*
round
before
.
At
any
rate
,
as
turned
out
,
she
had
been
wanting
*NL*
herself
,
quite
a
while
,
to
come
.
``
I
told
her
,
''
said
Waymarsh
,
``
that
it
*NL*
would
have
been
a
bright
idea
if
she
had
only
carried
it
out
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
pronounced
it
so
bright
as
to
be
almost
dazzling
.
``
But
why
*NL*
HAS
n't
she
carried
it
out
before
?
She
has
seen
me
every
day
--
she
had
*NL*
only
to
name
her
hour
.
I
've
been
waiting
and
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
told
her
you
had
.
And
she
has
been
waiting
too
.
''
It
was
,
in
*NL*
the
oddest
way
in
the
world
,
on
the
showing
of
this
tone
,
a
genial
new
*NL*
pressing
coaxing
Waymarsh
;
a
Waymarsh
conscious
with
a
different
*NL*
consciousness
from
any
he
had
yet
betrayed
,
and
actually
rendered
by
it
*NL*
almost
insinuating
.
He
lacked
only
time
for
full
persuasion
,
and
*NL*
Strether
was
to
see
in
a
moment
why
.
Meantime
,
however
,
our
friend
*NL*
perceived
,
he
was
announcing
a
step
of
some
magnanimity
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
's
part
,
so
that
he
could
deprecate
a
sharp
question
.
It
was
his
*NL*
own
high
purpose
in
fact
to
have
smoothed
sharp
questions
to
rest
.
He
*NL*
looked
his
old
comrade
very
straight
in
the
eyes
,
and
he
had
never
*NL*
conveyed
to
him
in
so
mute
a
manner
so
much
kind
confidence
and
so
much
*NL*
good
advice
.
Everything
that
was
between
them
was
again
in
his
face
,
*NL*
but
matured
and
shelved
and
finally
disposed
of
.
``
At
any
rate
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
she
's
coming
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Considering
how
many
pieces
had
to
fit
themselves
,
it
all
fell
,
in
*NL*
Strether
's
brain
,
into
a
close
rapid
order
.
He
saw
on
the
spot
what
*NL*
had
happened
,
and
what
probably
would
yet
;
and
it
was
all
funny
enough
.
*NL*
It
was
perhaps
just
this
freedom
of
appreciation
that
wound
him
up
to
*NL*
his
flare
of
high
spirits
.
``
What
is
she
coming
FOR
?
--
to
kill
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
coming
to
be
very
VERY
kind
to
you
,
and
you
must
let
me
say
that
*NL*
I
greatly
hope
you
'll
not
be
less
so
to
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
spoken
by
Waymarsh
with
much
gravity
of
admonition
,
and
as
*NL*
Strether
stood
there
he
knew
he
had
but
to
make
a
movement
to
take
the
*NL*
attitude
of
a
man
gracefully
receiving
a
present
.
The
present
was
that
*NL*
of
the
opportunity
dear
old
Waymarsh
had
flattered
himself
he
had
*NL*
divined
in
him
the
slight
soreness
of
not
having
yet
thoroughly
*NL*
enjoyed
;
so
he
had
brought
it
to
him
thus
,
as
on
a
little
silver
*NL*
breakfast-tray
,
familiarly
though
delicately
--
without
oppressive
pomp
;
*NL*
and
he
was
to
bend
and
smile
and
acknowledge
,
was
to
take
and
use
and
*NL*
be
grateful
.
He
was
not
--
that
was
the
beauty
of
it
--
to
be
asked
to
*NL*
deflect
too
much
from
his
dignity
.
No
wonder
the
old
boy
bloomed
in
*NL*
this
bland
air
of
his
own
distillation
.
Strether
felt
for
a
moment
as
*NL*
if
Sarah
were
actually
walking
up
and
down
outside
.
Was
n't
she
hanging
*NL*
about
the
porte-cochere
while
her
friend
thus
summarily
opened
a
way
?
*NL*
Strether
would
meet
her
but
to
take
it
,
and
everything
would
be
for
the
*NL*
best
in
the
best
of
possible
worlds
.
He
had
never
so
much
known
what
*NL*
any
one
meant
as
,
in
the
light
of
this
demonstration
,
he
knew
what
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
did
.
It
had
reached
Waymarsh
from
Sarah
,
but
it
had
reached
*NL*
Sarah
from
her
mother
,
and
there
was
no
break
in
the
chain
by
which
it
*NL*
reached
HIM
.
``
Has
anything
particular
happened
,
''
he
asked
after
a
*NL*
minute
--
``
so
suddenly
to
determine
her
?
Has
she
heard
anything
*NL*
unexpected
from
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
,
on
this
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
looked
at
him
harder
than
ever
.
*NL*
''
`
Unexpected
'
?
''
He
had
a
brief
hesitation
;
then
,
however
,
he
was
firm
.
*NL*
``
We
're
leaving
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leaving
?
That
IS
sudden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
showed
a
different
opinion
.
``
Less
so
than
it
may
seem
.
The
*NL*
purpose
of
Mrs.
Pocock
's
visit
is
to
explain
to
you
in
fact
that
it
's
*NL*
NOT
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
did
n't
at
all
know
if
he
had
really
an
advantage
--
anything
*NL*
that
would
practically
count
as
one
;
but
he
enjoyed
for
the
moment
--
as
*NL*
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
--
the
sense
of
so
carrying
it
off
.
He
*NL*
wondered
--
it
was
amusing
--
if
he
felt
as
the
impudent
feel
.
``
I
shall
*NL*
take
great
pleasure
,
I
assure
you
,
in
any
explanation
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
delighted
to
receive
Sarah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sombre
glow
just
darkened
in
his
comrade
's
eyes
;
but
he
was
struck
*NL*
with
the
way
it
died
out
again
.
It
was
too
mixed
with
another
*NL*
consciousness
--
it
was
too
smothered
,
as
might
be
said
,
in
flowers
.
He
*NL*
really
for
the
time
regretted
it
--
poor
dear
old
sombre
glow
!
Something
*NL*
straight
and
simple
,
something
heavy
and
empty
,
had
been
eclipsed
in
*NL*
its
company
;
something
by
which
he
had
best
known
his
friend
.
Waymarsh
*NL*
would
n't
BE
his
friend
,
somehow
,
without
the
occasional
ornament
of
the
*NL*
sacred
rage
,
and
the
right
to
the
sacred
rage
--
inestimably
precious
for
*NL*
Strether
's
charity
--
he
also
seemed
in
a
manner
,
and
at
Mrs.
Pocock
's
*NL*
elbow
,
to
have
forfeited
.
Strether
remembered
the
occasion
early
in
*NL*
their
stay
when
on
that
very
spot
he
had
come
out
with
his
earnest
,
his
*NL*
ominous
``
Quit
it
!
''
--
and
,
so
remembering
,
felt
it
hang
by
a
hair
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
himself
now
utter
the
same
note
.
Waymarsh
was
having
a
good
*NL*
time
--
this
was
the
truth
that
was
embarrassing
for
him
,
and
he
was
*NL*
having
it
then
and
there
,
he
was
having
it
in
Europe
,
he
was
having
it
*NL*
under
the
very
protection
of
circumstances
of
which
he
did
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
approve
;
all
of
which
placed
him
in
a
false
position
,
with
no
*NL*
issue
possible
--
none
at
least
by
the
grand
manner
.
It
was
practically
*NL*
in
the
manner
of
any
one
--
it
was
all
but
in
poor
Strether
's
own
--
that
*NL*
instead
of
taking
anything
up
he
merely
made
the
most
of
having
to
be
*NL*
himself
explanatory
.
``
I
'm
not
leaving
for
the
United
States
direct
.
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pocock
and
Miss
Mamie
are
thinking
of
a
little
trip
before
*NL*
their
own
return
,
and
we
've
been
talking
for
some
days
past
of
our
*NL*
joining
forces
.
We
've
settled
it
that
we
do
join
and
that
we
sail
*NL*
together
the
end
of
next
month
.
But
we
start
to-morrow
for
Switzerland
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Pocock
wants
some
scenery
.
She
has
n't
had
much
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
brave
in
his
way
too
,
keeping
nothing
back
,
confessing
all
there
*NL*
was
,
and
only
leaving
Strether
to
make
certain
connexions
.
``
Is
what
*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
had
cabled
her
daughter
an
injunction
to
break
off
short
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grand
manner
indeed
at
this
just
raised
its
head
a
little
.
``
I
know
*NL*
nothing
about
Mrs.
Newsome
's
cables
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
on
it
with
some
intensity
--
during
the
few
seconds
of
*NL*
which
something
happened
quite
out
of
proportion
to
the
time
.
It
*NL*
happened
that
Strether
,
looking
thus
at
his
friend
,
did
n't
take
his
*NL*
answer
for
truth
--
and
that
something
more
again
occurred
in
consequence
*NL*
of
THAT
.
Yes
--
Waymarsh
just
DID
know
about
Mrs.
Newsome
's
cables
:
to
*NL*
what
other
end
than
that
had
they
dined
together
at
Bignon
's
?
Strether
*NL*
almost
felt
for
the
instant
that
it
was
to
Mrs.
Newsome
herself
the
*NL*
dinner
had
been
given
;
and
,
for
that
matter
,
quite
felt
how
she
must
*NL*
have
known
about
it
and
,
as
he
might
think
,
protected
and
consecrated
*NL*
it
.
He
had
a
quick
blurred
view
of
daily
cables
,
questions
,
answers
,
*NL*
signals
:
clear
enough
was
his
vision
of
the
expense
that
,
when
so
*NL*
wound
up
,
the
lady
at
home
was
prepared
to
incur
.
Vivid
not
less
was
*NL*
his
memory
of
what
,
during
his
long
observation
of
her
,
some
of
her
*NL*
attainments
of
that
high
pitch
had
cost
her
.
Distinctly
she
was
at
the
*NL*
highest
now
,
and
Waymarsh
,
who
imagined
himself
an
independent
*NL*
performer
,
was
really
,
forcing
his
fine
old
natural
voice
,
an
*NL*
overstrained
accompanist
.
The
whole
reference
of
his
errand
seemed
to
*NL*
mark
her
for
Strether
as
by
this
time
consentingly
familiar
to
him
,
and
*NL*
nothing
yet
had
so
despoiled
her
of
a
special
shade
of
consideration
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
,
''
he
asked
,
``
whether
Sarah
has
been
directed
from
home
*NL*
to
try
me
on
the
matter
of
my
also
going
to
Switzerland
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Waymarsh
as
manfully
as
possible
,
``
nothing
whatever
*NL*
about
her
private
affairs
;
though
I
believe
her
to
be
acting
in
*NL*
conformity
with
things
that
have
my
highest
respect
.
''
It
was
as
manful
*NL*
as
possible
,
but
it
was
still
the
false
note
--
as
it
had
to
be
to
convey
*NL*
so
sorry
a
statement
.
He
knew
everything
,
Strether
more
and
more
felt
,
*NL*
that
he
thus
disclaimed
,
and
his
little
punishment
was
just
in
this
*NL*
doom
to
a
second
fib
.
What
falser
position
--
given
the
man
--
could
the
*NL*
most
vindictive
mind
impose
?
He
ended
by
squeezing
through
a
passage
in
*NL*
which
three
months
before
he
would
certainly
have
stuck
fast
.
``
Mrs
*NL*
Pocock
will
probably
be
ready
herself
to
answer
any
enquiry
you
may
put
*NL*
to
her
.
But
,
''
he
continued
,
``
BUT
--
!
''
He
faltered
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
?
Do
n't
put
her
too
many
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
looked
large
,
but
the
harm
was
done
;
he
could
n't
,
do
what
he
*NL*
would
,
help
looking
rosy
.
``
Do
n't
do
anything
you
'll
be
sorry
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
attenuation
,
Strether
guessed
,
of
something
else
that
had
*NL*
been
on
his
lips
;
it
was
a
sudden
drop
to
directness
,
and
was
thereby
*NL*
the
voice
of
sincerity
.
He
had
fallen
to
the
supplicating
note
,
and
*NL*
that
immediately
,
for
our
friend
,
made
a
difference
and
reinstated
him
.
*NL*
They
were
in
communication
as
they
had
been
,
that
first
morning
,
in
*NL*
Sarah
's
salon
and
in
her
presence
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
;
and
the
same
*NL*
recognition
of
a
great
good
will
was
again
,
after
all
,
possible
.
Only
*NL*
the
amount
of
response
Waymarsh
had
then
taken
for
granted
was
doubled
,
*NL*
decupled
now
.
This
came
out
when
he
presently
said
:
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
need
n't
assure
you
I
hope
you
'll
come
with
us
.
''
Then
it
was
that
his
*NL*
implications
and
expectations
loomed
up
for
Strether
as
almost
*NL*
pathetically
gross
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
patted
his
shoulder
while
he
thanked
him
,
giving
the
go-by
*NL*
to
the
question
of
joining
the
Pococks
;
he
expressed
the
joy
he
felt
at
*NL*
seeing
him
go
forth
again
so
brave
and
free
,
and
he
in
fact
almost
took
*NL*
leave
of
him
on
the
spot
.
``
I
shall
see
you
again
of
course
before
you
*NL*
go
;
but
I
'm
meanwhile
much
obliged
to
you
for
arranging
so
conveniently
*NL*
for
what
you
've
told
me
.
I
shall
walk
up
and
down
in
the
court
*NL*
there
--
dear
little
old
court
which
we
've
each
bepaced
so
,
this
last
*NL*
couple
of
months
,
to
the
tune
of
our
flights
and
our
drops
,
our
*NL*
hesitations
and
our
plunges
:
I
shall
hang
about
there
,
all
impatience
*NL*
and
excitement
,
please
let
Sarah
know
,
till
she
graciously
presents
*NL*
herself
.
Leave
me
with
her
without
fear
,
''
he
laughed
;
``
I
assure
you
I
*NL*
sha
n't
hurt
her
.
I
do
n't
think
either
she
'll
hurt
ME
:
I
'm
in
a
*NL*
situation
in
which
damage
was
some
time
ago
discounted
.
Besides
,
THAT
*NL*
is
n't
what
worries
you
--
but
do
n't
,
do
n't
explain
!
We
're
all
right
as
we
*NL*
are
:
which
was
the
degree
of
success
our
adventure
was
pledged
to
for
*NL*
each
of
us
.
We
were
n't
,
it
seemed
,
all
right
as
we
were
before
;
and
*NL*
we
've
got
over
the
ground
,
all
things
considered
,
quickly
.
I
hope
*NL*
you
'll
have
a
lovely
time
in
the
Alps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
fairly
looked
up
at
him
as
from
the
foot
of
them
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
as
I
OUGHT
really
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
conscience
of
Milrose
in
the
very
voice
of
Milrose
,
but
,
oh
*NL*
it
was
feeble
and
flat
!
Strether
suddenly
felt
quite
ashamed
for
him
;
*NL*
he
breathed
a
greater
boldness
.
``
LET
yourself
,
on
the
contrary
,
go
--
in
*NL*
all
agreeable
directions
.
These
are
precious
hours
--
at
our
age
they
*NL*
may
n't
recur
.
Do
n't
have
it
to
say
to
yourself
at
Milrose
,
next
*NL*
winter
,
that
you
had
n't
courage
for
them
.
''
And
then
as
his
comrade
*NL*
queerly
stared
:
``
Live
up
to
Mrs.
Pocock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Live
up
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
great
help
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
looked
at
it
as
at
one
of
the
uncomfortable
things
that
were
*NL*
certainly
true
and
that
it
was
yet
ironical
to
say
.
``
It
's
more
then
*NL*
than
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
your
own
chance
and
advantage
.
Besides
,
''
said
*NL*
Strether
,
``
I
do
in
my
way
contribute
.
I
know
what
I
'm
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waymarsh
had
kept
on
his
great
panama
,
and
,
as
he
now
stood
nearer
the
*NL*
door
,
his
last
look
beneath
the
shade
of
it
had
turned
again
to
*NL*
darkness
and
warning
.
``
So
do
I
!
See
here
,
Strether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
're
going
to
say
.
`
Quit
this
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quit
this
!
''
But
it
lacked
its
old
intensity
;
nothing
of
it
remained
;
*NL*
it
went
out
of
the
room
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
the
first
thing
,
strangely
enough
,
that
,
about
an
hour
later
,
*NL*
Strether
found
himself
doing
in
Sarah
's
presence
was
to
remark
*NL*
articulately
on
this
failure
,
in
their
friend
,
of
what
had
been
*NL*
superficially
his
great
distinction
.
It
was
as
if
--
he
alluded
of
*NL*
course
to
the
grand
manner
--
the
dear
man
had
sacrificed
it
to
some
*NL*
other
advantage
;
which
would
be
of
course
only
for
himself
to
measure
.
*NL*
It
might
be
simply
that
he
was
physically
so
much
more
sound
than
on
*NL*
his
first
coming
out
;
this
was
all
prosaic
,
comparatively
cheerful
and
*NL*
vulgar
.
And
fortunately
,
if
one
came
to
that
,
his
improvement
in
*NL*
health
was
really
itself
grander
than
any
manner
it
could
be
conceived
*NL*
as
having
cost
him
.
``
You
yourself
alone
,
dear
Sarah
''
--
Strether
took
*NL*
the
plunge
--
``
have
done
him
,
it
strikes
me
,
in
these
three
weeks
,
as
*NL*
much
good
as
all
the
rest
of
his
time
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
plunge
because
somehow
the
range
of
reference
was
,
in
the
*NL*
conditions
,
``
funny
,
''
and
made
funnier
still
by
Sarah
's
attitude
,
by
the
*NL*
turn
the
occasion
had
,
with
her
appearance
,
so
sensibly
taken
.
Her
*NL*
appearance
was
really
indeed
funnier
than
anything
else
--
the
spirit
in
*NL*
which
he
felt
her
to
be
there
as
soon
as
she
was
there
,
the
shade
of
*NL*
obscurity
that
cleared
up
for
him
as
soon
as
he
was
seated
with
her
in
*NL*
the
small
salon
de
lecture
that
had
,
for
the
most
part
,
in
all
the
*NL*
weeks
,
witnessed
the
wane
of
his
early
vivacity
of
discussion
with
*NL*
Waymarsh
.
It
was
an
immense
thing
,
quite
a
tremendous
thing
,
for
her
*NL*
to
have
come
:
this
truth
opened
out
to
him
in
spite
of
his
having
*NL*
already
arrived
for
himself
at
a
fairly
vivid
view
of
it
.
He
had
done
*NL*
exactly
what
he
had
given
Waymarsh
his
word
for
--
had
walked
and
*NL*
re-walked
the
court
while
he
awaited
her
advent
;
acquiring
in
this
*NL*
exercise
an
amount
of
light
that
affected
him
at
the
time
as
flooding
*NL*
the
scene
.
She
had
decided
upon
the
step
in
order
to
give
him
the
*NL*
benefit
of
a
doubt
,
in
order
to
be
able
to
say
to
her
mother
that
she
*NL*
had
,
even
to
abjectness
,
smoothed
the
way
for
him
.
The
doubt
had
been
*NL*
as
to
whether
he
might
n't
take
her
as
not
having
smoothed
it
--
and
the
*NL*
admonition
had
possibly
come
from
Waymarsh
's
more
detached
spirit
.
*NL*
Waymarsh
had
at
any
rate
,
certainly
,
thrown
his
weight
into
the
*NL*
scale
--
he
had
pointed
to
the
importance
of
depriving
their
friend
of
a
*NL*
grievance
.
She
had
done
justice
to
the
plea
,
and
it
was
to
set
herself
*NL*
right
with
a
high
ideal
that
she
actually
sat
there
in
her
state
.
Her
*NL*
calculation
was
sharp
in
the
immobility
with
which
she
held
her
tall
*NL*
parasol-stick
upright
and
at
arm
's
length
,
quite
as
if
she
had
struck
*NL*
the
place
to
plant
her
flag
;
in
the
separate
precautions
she
took
not
*NL*
to
show
as
nervous
;
in
the
aggressive
repose
in
which
she
did
quite
*NL*
nothing
but
wait
for
him
.
Doubt
ceased
to
be
possible
from
the
moment
*NL*
he
had
taken
in
that
she
had
arrived
with
no
proposal
whatever
;
that
*NL*
her
concern
was
simply
to
show
what
she
had
come
to
receive
.
She
had
*NL*
come
to
receive
his
submission
,
and
Waymarsh
was
to
have
made
it
plain
*NL*
to
him
that
she
would
expect
nothing
less
.
He
saw
fifty
things
,
her
*NL*
host
,
at
this
convenient
stage
;
but
one
of
those
he
most
saw
was
that
*NL*
their
anxious
friend
had
n't
quite
had
the
hand
required
of
him
.
*NL*
Waymarsh
HAD
,
however
,
uttered
the
request
that
she
might
find
him
*NL*
mild
,
and
while
hanging
about
the
court
before
her
arrival
he
had
*NL*
turned
over
with
zeal
the
different
ways
in
which
he
could
be
so
.
The
*NL*
difficulty
was
that
if
he
was
mild
he
was
n't
,
for
her
purpose
,
*NL*
conscious
.
If
she
wished
him
conscious
--
as
everything
about
her
cried
*NL*
aloud
that
she
did
--
she
must
accordingly
be
at
costs
to
make
him
so
.
*NL*
Conscious
he
was
,
for
himself
--
but
only
of
too
many
things
;
so
she
must
*NL*
choose
the
one
she
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
Practically
,
however
,
it
at
last
got
itself
named
,
and
when
once
that
*NL*
had
happened
they
were
quite
at
the
centre
of
their
situation
.
One
*NL*
thing
had
really
done
as
well
as
another
;
when
Strether
had
spoken
of
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
leaving
him
,
and
that
had
necessarily
brought
on
a
reference
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Pocock
's
similar
intention
,
the
jump
was
but
short
to
supreme
*NL*
lucidity
.
Light
became
indeed
after
that
so
intense
that
Strether
*NL*
would
doubtless
have
but
half
made
out
,
in
the
prodigious
glare
,
by
*NL*
which
of
the
two
the
issue
had
been
in
fact
precipitated
.
It
was
,
in
*NL*
their
contracted
quarters
,
as
much
there
between
them
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
something
suddenly
spilled
with
a
crash
and
a
splash
on
the
floor
.
The
*NL*
form
of
his
submission
was
to
be
an
engagement
to
acquit
himself
within
*NL*
the
twenty-four
hours
.
``
He
'll
go
in
a
moment
if
you
give
him
the
*NL*
word
--
he
assures
me
on
his
honour
he
'll
do
that
''
:
this
came
in
its
*NL*
order
,
out
of
its
order
,
in
respect
to
Chad
,
after
the
crash
had
*NL*
occurred
.
It
came
repeatedly
during
the
time
taken
by
Strether
to
feel
*NL*
that
he
was
even
more
fixed
in
his
rigour
than
he
had
supposed
--
the
*NL*
time
he
was
not
above
adding
to
a
little
by
telling
her
that
such
a
way
*NL*
of
putting
it
on
her
brother
's
part
left
him
sufficiently
surprised
.
*NL*
She
was
n't
at
all
funny
at
last
--
she
was
really
fine
;
and
he
felt
*NL*
easily
where
she
was
strong
--
strong
for
herself
.
It
had
n't
yet
so
come
*NL*
home
to
him
that
she
was
nobly
and
appointedly
officious
.
She
was
*NL*
acting
in
interests
grander
and
clearer
than
that
of
her
poor
little
*NL*
personal
,
poor
little
Parisian
equilibrium
,
and
all
his
consciousness
*NL*
of
her
mother
's
moral
pressure
profited
by
this
proof
of
its
sustaining
*NL*
force
.
She
would
be
held
up
;
she
would
be
strengthened
;
he
need
n't
in
*NL*
the
least
be
anxious
for
her
.
What
would
once
more
have
been
distinct
*NL*
to
him
had
he
tried
to
make
it
so
was
that
,
as
Mrs.
Newsome
was
*NL*
essentially
all
moral
pressure
,
the
presence
of
this
element
was
almost
*NL*
identical
with
her
own
presence
.
It
was
n't
perhaps
that
he
felt
he
was
*NL*
dealing
with
her
straight
,
but
it
was
certainly
as
if
she
had
been
*NL*
dealing
straight
with
HIM
.
She
was
reaching
him
somehow
by
the
*NL*
lengthened
arm
of
the
spirit
,
and
he
was
having
to
that
extent
to
take
*NL*
her
into
account
;
but
he
was
n't
reaching
her
in
turn
,
not
making
her
*NL*
take
HIM
;
he
was
only
reaching
Sarah
,
who
appeared
to
take
so
little
of
*NL*
him
.
``
Something
has
clearly
passed
between
you
and
Chad
,
''
he
presently
*NL*
said
,
``
that
I
think
I
ought
to
know
something
more
about
.
Does
he
put
*NL*
it
all
,
''
he
smiled
,
``
on
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
come
out
,
''
she
asked
,
``
to
put
it
all
on
HIM
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
replied
to
this
no
further
than
,
after
an
instant
,
by
saying
:
*NL*
``
Oh
it
's
all
right
.
Chad
I
mean
's
all
right
in
having
said
to
*NL*
you
--
well
anything
he
may
have
said
.
I
'll
TAKE
it
all
--
what
he
does
*NL*
put
on
me
.
Only
I
must
see
him
before
I
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
,
but
she
brought
it
out
.
``
Is
it
absolutely
necessary
you
*NL*
should
see
me
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
if
I
'm
to
give
you
any
definite
word
about
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
idea
then
,
''
she
returned
,
``
that
I
shall
keep
on
meeting
you
*NL*
only
to
be
exposed
to
fresh
humiliation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fixed
her
a
longer
time
.
``
Are
your
instructions
from
Mrs.
Newsome
*NL*
that
you
shall
,
even
at
the
worst
,
absolutely
and
irretrievably
break
*NL*
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
instructions
from
Mrs.
Newsome
are
,
if
you
please
,
my
affair
.
You
*NL*
know
perfectly
what
your
own
were
,
and
you
can
judge
for
yourself
of
*NL*
what
it
can
do
for
you
to
have
made
what
you
have
of
them
.
You
can
*NL*
perfectly
see
,
at
any
rate
,
I
'll
go
so
far
as
to
say
,
that
if
I
wish
*NL*
not
to
expose
myself
I
must
wish
still
less
to
expose
HER
.
''
She
had
*NL*
already
said
more
than
she
had
quite
expected
;
but
,
though
she
had
also
*NL*
pulled
up
,
the
colour
in
her
face
showed
him
he
should
from
one
moment
*NL*
to
the
other
have
it
all
.
He
now
indeed
felt
the
high
importance
of
his
*NL*
having
it
.
``
What
is
your
conduct
,
''
she
broke
out
as
if
to
*NL*
explain
--
``
what
is
your
conduct
but
an
outrage
to
women
like
US
?
I
mean
*NL*
your
acting
as
if
there
can
be
a
doubt
--
as
between
us
and
such
*NL*
another
--
of
his
duty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
a
moment
.
It
was
rather
much
to
deal
with
at
once
;
not
only
*NL*
the
question
itself
,
but
the
sore
abysses
it
revealed
.
``
Of
course
*NL*
they
're
totally
different
kinds
of
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
pretend
that
he
has
any
at
all
--
to
such
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
Madame
de
Vionnet
?
''
He
uttered
the
name
not
to
affront
*NL*
her
,
but
yet
again
to
gain
time
--
time
that
he
needed
for
taking
in
*NL*
something
still
other
and
larger
than
her
demand
of
a
moment
before
.
It
*NL*
was
n't
at
once
that
he
could
see
all
that
was
in
her
actual
challenge
;
*NL*
but
when
he
did
he
found
himself
just
checking
a
low
vague
sound
,
a
*NL*
sound
which
was
perhaps
the
nearest
approach
his
vocal
chords
had
ever
*NL*
known
to
a
growl
.
Everything
Mrs.
Pocock
had
failed
to
give
a
sign
of
*NL*
recognising
in
Chad
as
a
particular
part
of
a
*NL*
transformation
--
everything
that
had
lent
intention
to
this
particular
*NL*
failure
--
affected
him
as
gathered
into
a
large
loose
bundle
and
thrown
,
*NL*
in
her
words
,
into
his
face
.
The
missile
made
him
to
that
extent
catch
*NL*
his
breath
;
which
however
he
presently
recovered
.
``
Why
when
a
woman
's
*NL*
at
once
so
charming
and
so
beneficent
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
sacrifice
mothers
and
sisters
to
her
without
a
blush
and
can
*NL*
make
them
cross
the
ocean
on
purpose
to
feel
the
more
and
take
from
you
*NL*
the
straighter
,
HOW
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
she
had
taken
him
up
as
short
and
as
sharply
as
that
,
but
he
tried
*NL*
not
to
flounder
in
her
grasp
.
``
I
do
n't
think
there
's
anything
I
've
*NL*
done
in
any
such
calculated
way
as
you
describe
.
Everything
has
come
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
indistinguishable
part
of
everything
else
.
Your
coming
out
*NL*
belonged
closely
to
my
having
come
before
you
,
and
my
having
come
was
a
*NL*
result
of
our
general
state
of
mind
.
Our
general
state
of
mind
had
*NL*
proceeded
,
on
its
side
,
from
our
queer
ignorance
,
our
queer
*NL*
misconceptions
and
confusions
--
from
which
,
since
then
,
an
inexorable
*NL*
tide
of
light
seems
to
have
floated
us
into
our
perhaps
still
queerer
*NL*
knowledge
.
Do
n't
you
LIKE
your
brother
as
he
is
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
and
*NL*
have
n't
you
given
your
mother
an
intelligible
account
of
all
that
that
*NL*
comes
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
put
to
her
also
,
doubtless
,
his
own
tone
,
too
many
things
,
this
at
*NL*
least
would
have
been
the
case
had
n't
his
final
challenge
directly
*NL*
helped
her
.
Everything
,
at
the
stage
they
had
reached
,
directly
helped
*NL*
her
,
because
everything
betrayed
in
him
such
a
basis
of
intention
.
He
*NL*
saw
--
the
odd
way
things
came
out
!
--
that
he
would
have
been
held
less
*NL*
monstrous
had
he
only
been
a
little
wilder
.
What
exposed
him
was
just
*NL*
his
poor
old
trick
of
quiet
inwardness
,
what
exposed
him
was
his
*NL*
THINKING
such
offence
.
He
had
n't
in
the
least
however
the
desire
to
*NL*
irritate
that
Sarah
imputed
to
him
,
and
he
could
only
at
last
*NL*
temporise
,
for
the
moment
,
with
her
indignant
view
.
She
was
altogether
*NL*
more
inflamed
than
he
had
expected
,
and
he
would
probably
understand
*NL*
this
better
when
he
should
learn
what
had
occurred
for
her
with
Chad
.
*NL*
Till
then
her
view
of
his
particular
blackness
,
her
clear
surprise
at
*NL*
his
not
clutching
the
pole
she
held
out
,
must
pass
as
extravagant
.
``
I
*NL*
leave
you
to
flatter
yourself
,
''
she
returned
,
``
that
what
you
speak
of
*NL*
is
what
YOU
'VE
beautifully
done
.
When
a
thing
has
been
already
*NL*
described
in
such
a
lovely
way
--
!
''
But
she
caught
herself
up
,
and
her
*NL*
comment
on
his
description
rang
out
sufficiently
loud
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
consider
her
even
an
apology
for
a
decent
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
there
it
was
at
last
!
She
put
the
matter
more
crudely
than
,
for
his
*NL*
own
mixed
purposes
,
he
had
yet
had
to
do
;
but
essentially
it
was
all
*NL*
one
matter
.
It
was
so
much
--
so
much
;
and
she
treated
it
,
poor
lady
,
as
*NL*
so
little
.
He
grew
conscious
,
as
he
was
now
apt
to
do
,
of
a
strange
*NL*
smile
,
and
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
talking
like
Miss
Barrace
.
*NL*
``
She
has
struck
me
from
the
first
as
wonderful
.
I
've
been
thinking
too
*NL*
moreover
that
,
after
all
,
she
would
probably
have
represented
even
for
*NL*
yourself
something
rather
new
and
rather
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
to
have
given
Mrs.
Pocock
with
this
,
however
,
but
her
best
*NL*
opportunity
for
a
sound
of
derision
.
``
Rather
new
?
I
hope
so
with
all
*NL*
my
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
''
he
explained
,
``
that
she
might
have
affected
you
by
her
*NL*
exquisite
amiability
--
a
real
revelation
,
it
has
seemed
to
myself
;
her
*NL*
high
rarity
,
her
distinction
of
every
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
,
with
these
words
,
consciously
a
little
``
precious
''
;
but
he
*NL*
had
had
to
be
--
he
could
n't
give
her
the
truth
of
the
case
without
them
;
*NL*
and
it
seemed
to
him
moreover
now
that
he
did
n't
care
.
He
had
at
all
*NL*
events
not
served
his
cause
,
for
she
sprang
at
its
exposed
side
.
``
A
*NL*
`
revelation
'
--
to
ME
:
I
've
come
to
such
a
woman
for
a
revelation
?
You
*NL*
talk
to
me
about
`
distinction
'
--
YOU
,
you
who
've
had
your
*NL*
privilege
?
--
when
the
most
distinguished
woman
we
shall
either
of
us
*NL*
have
seen
in
this
world
sits
there
insulted
,
in
her
loneliness
,
by
your
*NL*
incredible
comparison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
forbore
,
with
an
effort
,
from
straying
;
but
he
looked
all
*NL*
about
him
.
``
Does
your
mother
herself
make
the
point
that
she
sits
*NL*
insulted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sarah
's
answer
came
so
straight
,
so
``
pat
,
''
as
might
have
been
said
,
*NL*
that
he
felt
on
the
instant
its
origin
.
``
She
has
confided
to
my
*NL*
judgement
and
my
tenderness
the
expression
of
her
personal
sense
of
*NL*
everything
,
and
the
assertion
of
her
personal
dignity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
the
very
words
of
the
lady
of
Woollett
--
he
would
have
known
*NL*
them
in
a
thousand
;
her
parting
charge
to
her
child
.
Mrs.
Pocock
*NL*
accordingly
spoke
to
this
extent
by
book
,
and
the
fact
immensely
moved
*NL*
him
.
``
If
she
does
really
feel
as
you
say
it
's
of
course
very
very
*NL*
dreadful
.
I
've
given
sufficient
proof
,
one
would
have
thought
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
of
my
deep
admiration
for
Mrs.
Newsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
what
proof
would
one
have
thought
you
'd
CALL
sufficient
?
That
*NL*
of
thinking
this
person
here
so
far
superior
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
again
;
he
waited
.
``
Ah
dear
Sarah
,
you
must
LEAVE
me
this
*NL*
person
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
desire
to
avoid
all
vulgar
retorts
,
to
show
how
,
even
*NL*
perversely
,
he
clung
to
his
rag
of
reason
,
he
had
softly
almost
wailed
*NL*
this
plea
.
Yet
he
knew
it
to
be
perhaps
the
most
positive
declaration
*NL*
he
had
ever
made
in
his
life
,
and
his
visitor
's
reception
of
it
*NL*
virtually
gave
it
that
importance
.
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
'm
delighted
*NL*
to
do
.
God
knows
WE
do
n't
want
her
!
You
take
good
care
not
to
meet
,
''
*NL*
she
observed
in
a
still
higher
key
,
``
my
question
about
their
life
.
If
*NL*
you
do
consider
it
a
thing
one
can
even
SPEAK
of
,
I
congratulate
you
on
*NL*
your
taste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
she
alluded
to
was
of
course
Chad
's
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
,
*NL*
which
she
thus
bracketed
together
in
a
way
that
made
him
wince
a
*NL*
little
;
there
being
nothing
for
him
but
to
take
home
her
full
*NL*
intention
.
It
was
none
the
less
his
inconsequence
that
while
he
had
*NL*
himself
been
enjoying
for
weeks
the
view
of
the
brilliant
woman
's
*NL*
specific
action
,
he
just
suffered
from
any
characterisation
of
it
by
*NL*
other
lips
.
``
I
think
tremendously
well
of
her
,
at
the
same
time
that
I
*NL*
seem
to
feel
her
`
life
'
to
be
really
none
of
my
business
.
It
's
my
*NL*
business
,
that
is
,
only
so
far
as
Chad
's
own
life
is
affected
by
it
;
*NL*
and
what
has
happened
,
do
n't
you
see
?
is
that
Chad
's
has
been
affected
*NL*
so
beautifully
.
The
proof
of
the
pudding
's
in
the
eating
''
--
he
tried
,
*NL*
with
no
great
success
,
to
help
it
out
with
a
touch
of
pleasantry
,
while
*NL*
she
let
him
go
on
as
if
to
sink
and
sink
.
He
went
on
however
well
*NL*
enough
,
as
well
as
he
could
do
without
fresh
counsel
;
he
indeed
*NL*
should
n't
stand
quite
firm
,
he
felt
,
till
he
should
have
re-established
*NL*
his
communications
with
Chad
.
Still
,
he
could
always
speak
for
the
*NL*
woman
he
had
so
definitely
promised
to
``
save
.
''
This
was
n't
quite
for
*NL*
her
the
air
of
salvation
;
but
as
that
chill
fairly
deepened
what
did
it
*NL*
become
but
a
reminder
that
one
might
at
the
worst
perish
WITH
her
?
And
*NL*
it
was
simple
enough
--
it
was
rudimentary
:
not
,
not
to
give
her
away
.
*NL*
``
I
find
in
her
more
merits
than
you
would
probably
have
patience
with
*NL*
my
counting
over
.
And
do
you
know
,
''
he
enquired
,
``
the
effect
you
*NL*
produce
on
me
by
alluding
to
her
in
such
terms
?
It
's
as
if
you
had
*NL*
some
motive
in
not
recognising
all
she
has
done
for
your
brother
,
and
*NL*
so
shut
your
eyes
to
each
side
of
the
matter
,
in
order
,
whichever
side
*NL*
comes
up
,
to
get
rid
of
the
other
.
I
do
n't
,
you
must
allow
me
to
say
,
*NL*
see
how
you
can
with
any
pretence
to
candour
get
rid
of
the
side
*NL*
nearest
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Near
me
--
THAT
sort
of
thing
?
''
And
Sarah
gave
a
jerk
back
of
her
head
*NL*
that
well
might
have
nullified
any
active
proximity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
kept
her
friend
himself
at
his
distance
,
and
he
respected
for
a
*NL*
moment
the
interval
.
Then
with
a
last
persuasive
effort
he
bridged
it
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
,
on
your
honour
,
appreciate
Chad
's
fortunate
development
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fortunate
?
''
she
echoed
again
.
And
indeed
she
was
prepared
.
``
I
call
it
*NL*
hideous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
departure
had
been
for
some
minutes
marked
as
imminent
,
and
she
was
*NL*
already
at
the
door
that
stood
open
to
the
court
,
from
the
threshold
of
*NL*
which
she
delivered
herself
of
this
judgement
.
It
rang
out
so
loud
as
*NL*
to
produce
for
the
time
the
hush
of
everything
else
.
Strether
quite
,
*NL*
as
an
effect
of
it
,
breathed
less
bravely
;
he
could
acknowledge
it
,
but
*NL*
simply
enough
.
``
Oh
if
you
think
THAT
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
all
's
at
an
end
?
So
much
the
better
.
I
do
think
that
!
''
She
*NL*
passed
out
as
she
spoke
and
took
her
way
straight
across
the
court
,
*NL*
beyond
which
,
separated
from
them
by
the
deep
arch
of
the
porte-cochere
*NL*
the
low
victoria
that
had
conveyed
her
from
her
own
hotel
was
drawn
up
.
*NL*
She
made
for
it
with
decision
,
and
the
manner
of
her
break
,
the
sharp
*NL*
shaft
of
her
rejoinder
,
had
an
intensity
by
which
Strether
was
at
first
*NL*
kept
in
arrest
.
She
had
let
fly
at
him
as
from
a
stretched
cord
,
and
*NL*
it
took
him
a
minute
to
recover
from
the
sense
of
being
pierced
.
It
*NL*
was
not
the
penetration
of
surprise
;
it
was
that
,
much
more
,
of
*NL*
certainty
;
his
case
being
put
for
him
as
he
had
as
yet
only
put
it
to
*NL*
himself
.
She
was
away
at
any
rate
;
she
had
distanced
him
--
with
rather
*NL*
a
grand
spring
,
an
effect
of
pride
and
ease
,
after
all
;
she
had
got
*NL*
into
her
carriage
before
he
could
overtake
her
,
and
the
vehicle
was
*NL*
already
in
motion
.
He
stopped
halfway
;
he
stood
there
in
the
court
*NL*
only
seeing
her
go
and
noting
that
she
gave
him
no
other
look
.
The
way
*NL*
he
had
put
it
to
himself
was
that
all
quite
MIGHT
be
at
an
end
.
Each
*NL*
of
her
movements
,
in
this
resolute
rupture
,
reaffirmed
,
re-enforced
*NL*
that
idea
.
Sarah
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
sunny
street
while
,
planted
*NL*
there
in
the
centre
of
the
comparatively
grey
court
,
he
continued
*NL*
merely
to
look
before
him
.
It
probably
WAS
all
at
an
end
.

He
went
late
that
evening
to
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
,
having
his
*NL*
impression
that
it
would
be
vain
to
go
early
,
and
having
also
,
more
*NL*
than
once
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
made
enquiries
of
the
concierge
.
*NL*
Chad
had
n't
come
in
and
had
left
no
intimation
;
he
had
affairs
,
*NL*
apparently
,
at
this
juncture
--
as
it
occurred
to
Strether
he
so
well
*NL*
might
have
--
that
kept
him
long
abroad
.
Our
friend
asked
once
for
him
*NL*
at
the
hotel
in
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
but
the
only
contribution
offered
*NL*
there
was
the
fact
that
every
one
was
out
.
It
was
with
the
idea
that
*NL*
he
would
have
to
come
home
to
sleep
that
Strether
went
up
to
his
rooms
,
*NL*
from
which
however
he
was
still
absent
,
though
,
from
the
balcony
,
a
few
*NL*
moments
later
,
his
visitor
heard
eleven
o'clock
strike
.
Chad
's
servant
*NL*
had
by
this
time
answered
for
his
reappearance
;
he
HAD
,
the
visitor
*NL*
learned
,
come
quickly
in
to
dress
for
dinner
and
vanish
again
.
Strether
*NL*
spent
an
hour
in
waiting
for
him
--
an
hour
full
of
strange
suggestions
,
*NL*
persuasions
,
recognitions
;
one
of
those
that
he
was
to
recall
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
his
adventure
,
as
the
particular
handful
that
most
had
counted
.
*NL*
The
mellowest
lamplight
and
the
easiest
chair
had
been
placed
at
his
*NL*
disposal
by
Baptiste
,
subtlest
of
servants
;
the
novel
half-uncut
,
the
*NL*
novel
lemon-coloured
and
tender
,
with
the
ivory
knife
athwart
it
like
*NL*
the
dagger
in
a
contadina
's
hair
,
had
been
pushed
within
the
soft
*NL*
circle
--
a
circle
which
,
for
some
reason
,
affected
Strether
as
softer
*NL*
still
after
the
same
Baptiste
had
remarked
that
in
the
absence
of
a
*NL*
further
need
of
anything
by
Monsieur
he
would
betake
himself
to
bed
.
*NL*
The
night
was
hot
and
heavy
and
the
single
lamp
sufficient
;
the
great
*NL*
flare
of
the
lighted
city
,
rising
high
,
spending
itself
afar
,
played
up
*NL*
from
the
Boulevard
and
,
through
the
vague
vista
of
the
successive
*NL*
rooms
,
brought
objects
into
view
and
added
to
their
dignity
.
Strether
*NL*
found
himself
in
possession
as
he
never
yet
had
been
;
he
had
been
there
*NL*
alone
,
had
turned
over
books
and
prints
,
had
invoked
,
in
Chad
's
*NL*
absence
,
the
spirit
of
the
place
,
but
never
at
the
witching
hour
and
*NL*
never
with
a
relish
quite
so
like
a
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
long
time
on
the
balcony
;
he
hung
over
it
as
he
had
seen
*NL*
little
Bilham
hang
the
day
of
his
first
approach
,
as
he
had
seen
Mamie
*NL*
hang
over
her
own
the
day
little
Bilham
himself
might
have
seen
her
*NL*
from
below
;
he
passed
back
into
the
rooms
,
the
three
that
occupied
the
*NL*
front
and
that
communicated
by
wide
doors
;
and
,
while
he
circulated
and
*NL*
rested
,
tried
to
recover
the
impression
that
they
had
made
on
him
three
*NL*
months
before
,
to
catch
again
the
voice
in
which
they
had
seemed
then
*NL*
to
speak
to
him
.
That
voice
,
he
had
to
note
,
failed
audibly
to
sound
;
*NL*
which
he
took
as
the
proof
of
all
the
change
in
himself
.
He
had
heard
,
*NL*
of
old
,
only
what
he
COULD
then
hear
;
what
he
could
do
now
was
to
think
*NL*
of
three
months
ago
as
a
point
in
the
far
past
.
All
voices
had
grown
*NL*
thicker
and
meant
more
things
;
they
crowded
on
him
as
he
moved
*NL*
about
--
it
was
the
way
they
sounded
together
that
would
n't
let
him
be
*NL*
still
.
He
felt
,
strangely
,
as
sad
as
if
he
had
come
for
some
wrong
,
*NL*
and
yet
as
excited
as
if
he
had
come
for
some
freedom
.
But
the
freedom
*NL*
was
what
was
most
in
the
place
and
the
hour
,
it
was
the
freedom
that
*NL*
most
brought
him
round
again
to
the
youth
of
his
own
that
he
had
long
*NL*
ago
missed
.
He
could
have
explained
little
enough
to-day
either
why
he
*NL*
had
missed
it
or
why
,
after
years
and
years
,
he
should
care
that
he
*NL*
had
;
the
main
truth
of
the
actual
appeal
of
everything
was
none
the
*NL*
less
that
everything
represented
the
substance
of
his
loss
put
it
*NL*
within
reach
,
within
touch
,
made
it
,
to
a
degree
it
had
never
been
,
an
*NL*
affair
of
the
senses
.
That
was
what
it
became
for
him
at
this
singular
*NL*
time
,
the
youth
he
had
long
ago
missed
--
a
queer
concrete
presence
,
full
*NL*
of
mystery
,
yet
full
of
reality
,
which
he
could
handle
,
taste
,
smell
,
*NL*
the
deep
breathing
of
which
he
could
positively
hear
.
It
was
in
the
*NL*
outside
air
as
well
as
within
;
it
was
in
the
long
watch
,
from
the
*NL*
balcony
,
in
the
summer
night
,
of
the
wide
late
life
of
Paris
,
the
*NL*
unceasing
soft
quick
rumble
,
below
,
of
the
little
lighted
carriages
*NL*
that
,
in
the
press
,
always
suggested
the
gamblers
he
had
seen
of
old
at
*NL*
Monte
Carlo
pushing
up
to
the
tables
.
This
image
was
before
him
when
*NL*
he
at
last
became
aware
that
Chad
was
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
tells
me
you
put
it
all
on
ME
''
--
he
had
arrived
after
this
promptly
*NL*
enough
at
that
information
;
which
expressed
the
case
however
quite
as
*NL*
the
young
man
appeared
willing
for
the
moment
to
leave
it
.
Other
*NL*
things
,
with
this
advantage
of
their
virtually
having
the
night
before
*NL*
them
,
came
up
for
them
,
and
had
,
as
well
,
the
odd
effect
of
making
the
*NL*
occasion
,
instead
of
hurried
and
feverish
,
one
of
the
largest
,
loosest
*NL*
and
easiest
to
which
Strether
's
whole
adventure
was
to
have
treated
*NL*
him
.
He
had
been
pursuing
Chad
from
an
early
hour
and
had
overtaken
*NL*
him
only
now
;
but
now
the
delay
was
repaired
by
their
being
so
*NL*
exceptionally
confronted
.
They
had
foregathered
enough
of
course
in
*NL*
all
the
various
times
;
they
had
again
and
again
,
since
that
first
night
*NL*
at
the
theatre
,
been
face
to
face
over
their
question
;
but
they
had
*NL*
never
been
so
alone
together
as
they
were
actually
alone
--
their
talk
*NL*
had
n't
yet
been
so
supremely
for
themselves
.
And
if
many
things
*NL*
moreover
passed
before
them
,
none
passed
more
distinctly
for
Strether
*NL*
than
that
striking
truth
about
Chad
of
which
he
had
been
so
often
moved
*NL*
to
take
note
:
the
truth
that
everything
came
happily
back
with
him
to
*NL*
his
knowing
how
to
live
.
It
had
been
seated
in
his
pleased
smile
--
a
*NL*
smile
that
pleased
exactly
in
the
right
degree
--
as
his
visitor
turned
*NL*
round
,
on
the
balcony
,
to
greet
his
advent
;
his
visitor
in
fact
felt
on
*NL*
the
spot
that
there
was
nothing
their
meeting
would
so
much
do
as
bear
*NL*
witness
to
that
facility
.
He
surrendered
himself
accordingly
to
so
*NL*
approved
a
gift
;
for
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
facility
but
that
*NL*
others
DID
surrender
themselves
?
He
did
n't
want
,
luckily
,
to
prevent
*NL*
Chad
from
living
;
but
he
was
quite
aware
that
even
if
he
had
he
would
*NL*
himself
have
thoroughly
gone
to
pieces
.
It
was
in
truth
essentially
by
*NL*
bringing
down
his
personal
life
to
a
function
all
subsidiary
to
the
*NL*
young
man
's
own
that
he
held
together
.
And
the
great
point
,
above
all
,
*NL*
the
sign
of
how
completely
Chad
possessed
the
knowledge
in
question
,
*NL*
was
that
one
thus
became
,
not
only
with
a
proper
cheerfulness
,
but
with
*NL*
wild
native
impulses
,
the
feeder
of
his
stream
.
Their
talk
had
*NL*
accordingly
not
lasted
three
minutes
without
Strether
's
feeling
basis
*NL*
enough
for
the
excitement
in
which
he
had
waited
.
This
overflow
fairly
*NL*
deepened
,
wastefully
abounded
,
as
he
observed
the
smallness
of
anything
*NL*
corresponding
to
it
on
the
part
of
his
friend
.
That
was
exactly
this
*NL*
friend
's
happy
case
;
he
``
put
out
''
his
excitement
,
or
whatever
other
*NL*
emotion
the
matter
involved
,
as
he
put
out
his
washing
;
than
which
no
*NL*
arrangement
could
make
more
for
domestic
order
.
It
was
quite
for
*NL*
Strether
himself
in
short
to
feel
a
personal
analogy
with
the
laundress
*NL*
bringing
home
the
triumphs
of
the
mangle
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
reported
on
Sarah
's
visit
,
which
he
did
very
fully
,
Chad
*NL*
answered
his
question
with
perfect
candour
.
``
I
positively
referred
her
*NL*
to
you
--
told
her
she
must
absolutely
see
you
.
This
was
last
night
,
and
*NL*
it
all
took
place
in
ten
minutes
.
It
was
our
first
free
talk
--
really
*NL*
the
first
time
she
had
tackled
me
.
She
knew
I
also
knew
what
her
line
*NL*
had
been
with
yourself
;
knew
moreover
how
little
you
had
been
doing
to
*NL*
make
anything
difficult
for
her
.
So
I
spoke
for
you
frankly
--
assured
*NL*
her
you
were
all
at
her
service
.
I
assured
her
I
was
too
,
''
the
young
*NL*
man
continued
;
``
and
I
pointed
out
how
she
could
perfectly
,
at
any
time
,
*NL*
have
got
at
me
.
Her
difficulty
has
been
simply
her
not
finding
the
*NL*
moment
she
fancied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
difficulty
,
''
Strether
returned
,
``
has
been
simply
that
she
finds
*NL*
she
's
afraid
of
you
.
She
's
not
afraid
of
ME
,
Sarah
,
one
little
scrap
;
*NL*
and
it
was
just
because
she
has
seen
how
I
can
fidget
when
I
give
my
*NL*
mind
to
it
that
she
has
felt
her
best
chance
,
rightly
enough
to
be
in
*NL*
making
me
as
uneasy
as
possible
.
I
think
she
's
at
bottom
as
pleased
to
*NL*
HAVE
you
put
it
on
me
as
you
yourself
can
possibly
be
to
put
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
in
the
world
,
my
dear
man
,
''
Chad
enquired
in
objection
to
*NL*
this
luminosity
,
``
have
I
done
to
make
Sally
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
`
wonderful
,
wonderful
,
'
as
we
say
--
we
poor
people
who
*NL*
watch
the
play
from
the
pit
;
and
that
's
what
has
,
admirably
,
made
her
.
*NL*
Made
her
all
the
more
effectually
that
she
could
see
you
did
n't
set
*NL*
about
it
on
purpose
--
I
mean
set
about
affecting
her
as
with
fear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
cast
a
pleasant
backward
glance
over
his
possibilities
of
motive
.
*NL*
``
I
've
only
wanted
to
be
kind
and
friendly
,
to
be
decent
and
*NL*
attentive
--
and
I
still
only
want
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
smiled
at
his
comfortable
clearness
.
``
Well
,
there
can
*NL*
certainly
be
no
way
for
it
better
than
by
my
taking
the
onus
.
It
*NL*
reduces
your
personal
friction
and
your
personal
offence
to
almost
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
but
Chad
,
with
his
completer
conception
of
the
friendly
,
would
n't
*NL*
quite
have
this
!
They
had
remained
on
the
balcony
,
where
,
after
their
*NL*
day
of
great
and
premature
heat
,
the
midnight
air
was
delicious
;
and
*NL*
they
leaned
back
in
turn
against
the
balustrade
,
all
in
harmony
with
*NL*
the
chairs
and
the
flower-pots
,
the
cigarettes
and
the
starlight
.
``
The
*NL*
onus
is
n't
REALLY
yours
--
after
our
agreeing
so
to
wait
together
and
*NL*
judge
together
.
That
was
all
my
answer
to
Sally
,
''
Chad
pursued
--
``
that
*NL*
we
have
been
,
that
we
are
,
just
judging
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
the
burden
,
''
Strether
explained
;
``
I
have
n't
come
in
*NL*
the
least
that
you
should
take
it
off
me
.
I
've
come
very
much
,
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
,
to
double
up
my
fore
legs
in
the
manner
of
the
camel
when
*NL*
he
gets
down
on
his
knees
to
make
his
back
convenient
.
But
I
've
*NL*
supposed
you
all
this
while
to
have
been
doing
a
lot
of
special
and
*NL*
private
judging
--
about
which
I
have
n't
troubled
you
;
and
I
've
only
*NL*
wished
to
have
your
conclusion
first
from
you
.
I
do
n't
ask
more
than
*NL*
that
;
I
'm
quite
ready
to
take
it
as
it
has
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
turned
up
his
face
to
the
sky
with
a
slow
puff
of
his
smoke
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
waited
a
little
.
``
I
've
left
you
wholly
alone
;
have
n't
,
I
*NL*
think
I
may
say
,
since
the
first
hour
or
two
--
when
I
merely
preached
*NL*
patience
--
so
much
as
breathed
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
've
been
awfully
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
both
been
good
then
--
we
've
played
the
game
.
We
've
given
them
*NL*
the
most
liberal
conditions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
splendid
conditions
!
It
was
open
to
them
,
open
to
*NL*
them
''
--
he
seemed
to
make
it
out
,
as
he
smoked
,
with
his
eyes
still
on
*NL*
the
stars
.
He
might
in
quiet
sport
have
been
reading
their
horoscope
.
*NL*
Strether
wondered
meanwhile
what
had
been
open
to
them
,
and
he
finally
*NL*
let
him
have
it
.
``
It
was
open
to
them
simply
to
let
me
alone
;
to
have
*NL*
made
up
their
minds
,
on
really
seeing
me
for
themselves
,
that
I
could
*NL*
go
on
well
enough
as
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
assented
to
this
proposition
with
full
lucidity
,
his
*NL*
companion
's
plural
pronoun
,
which
stood
all
for
Mrs.
Newsome
and
her
*NL*
daughter
,
having
no
ambiguity
for
him
.
There
was
nothing
,
apparently
,
*NL*
to
stand
for
Mamie
and
Jim
;
and
this
added
to
our
friend
's
sense
of
*NL*
Chad
's
knowing
what
he
thought
.
``
But
they
've
made
up
their
minds
to
*NL*
the
opposite
--
that
you
CA
N'T
go
on
as
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Chad
continued
in
the
same
way
;
``
they
wo
n't
have
it
for
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
on
his
side
also
reflectively
smoked
.
It
was
as
if
their
high
*NL*
place
really
represented
some
moral
elevation
from
which
they
could
*NL*
look
down
on
their
recent
past
.
``
There
never
was
the
smallest
chance
,
*NL*
do
you
know
,
that
they
WOULD
have
it
for
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
--
no
real
chance
.
But
if
they
were
willing
to
think
*NL*
there
was
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
n't
willing
.
''
Strether
had
worked
it
all
out
.
``
It
was
n't
for
*NL*
you
they
came
out
,
but
for
me
.
It
was
n't
to
see
for
themselves
what
*NL*
you
're
doing
,
but
what
I
'm
doing
.
The
first
branch
of
their
curiosity
*NL*
was
inevitably
destined
,
under
my
culpable
delay
,
to
give
way
to
the
*NL*
second
;
and
it
's
on
the
second
that
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
and
*NL*
you
do
n't
mind
my
marking
the
invidious
fact
,
they
've
been
of
late
*NL*
exclusively
perched
.
When
Sarah
sailed
it
was
me
,
in
other
words
,
they
*NL*
were
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
took
it
in
both
with
intelligence
and
with
indulgence
.
``
It
IS
*NL*
rather
a
business
then
--
what
I
've
let
you
in
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
again
a
brief
pause
;
which
ended
in
a
reply
that
seemed
to
*NL*
dispose
once
for
all
of
this
element
of
compunction
.
Chad
was
to
treat
*NL*
it
,
at
any
rate
,
so
far
as
they
were
again
together
,
as
having
done
so
.
*NL*
``
I
was
`
in
'
when
you
found
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
it
was
you
,
''
the
young
man
laughed
,
``
who
found
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
found
you
out
.
It
was
you
who
found
me
in
.
It
was
all
in
the
*NL*
day
's
work
for
them
,
at
all
events
,
that
they
should
come
.
And
they
've
*NL*
greatly
enjoyed
it
,
''
Strether
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
tried
to
make
them
,
''
said
Chad
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
did
himself
presently
the
same
justice
.
``
So
have
I.
I
*NL*
tried
even
this
very
morning
--
while
Mrs.
Pocock
was
with
me
.
She
*NL*
enjoys
for
instance
,
almost
as
much
as
anything
else
,
not
being
,
as
*NL*
I
've
said
,
afraid
of
me
;
and
I
think
I
gave
her
help
in
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
took
a
deeper
interest
.
``
Was
she
very
very
nasty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
debated
.
``
Well
,
she
was
the
most
important
thing
--
she
was
*NL*
definite
.
She
was
--
at
last
--
crystalline
.
And
I
felt
no
remorse
.
I
saw
*NL*
that
they
must
have
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
wanted
to
see
them
for
myself
;
so
that
if
it
were
only
for
*NL*
THAT
--
!
''
Chad
's
own
remorse
was
as
small
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeared
almost
all
Strether
wanted
.
``
Is
n't
your
having
seen
them
*NL*
for
yourself
then
THE
thing
,
beyond
all
others
,
that
has
come
of
their
*NL*
visit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
looked
as
if
he
thought
it
nice
of
his
old
friend
to
put
it
so
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
count
it
as
anything
that
you
're
dished
--
if
you
ARE
dished
?
*NL*
Are
you
,
my
dear
man
,
dished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
sounded
as
if
he
were
asking
if
he
had
caught
cold
or
hurt
his
foot
,
*NL*
and
Strether
for
a
minute
but
smoked
and
smoked
.
``
I
want
to
see
her
*NL*
again
.
I
must
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
must
.
''
Then
Chad
hesitated
.
``
Do
you
mean
--
a
--
Mother
*NL*
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
your
mother
--
that
will
depend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
Mrs.
Newsome
had
somehow
been
placed
by
the
words
very
far
*NL*
off
.
Chad
however
endeavoured
in
spite
of
this
to
reach
the
place
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
it
will
depend
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
for
all
answer
,
gave
him
a
longish
look
.
``
I
was
speaking
of
*NL*
Sarah
.
I
must
positively
--
though
she
quite
cast
me
off
--
see
HER
again
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
part
with
her
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
was
awfully
unpleasant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Strether
exhaled
.
``
She
was
what
she
had
to
be
.
I
mean
that
from
*NL*
the
moment
they
're
not
delighted
they
can
only
be
--
well
what
I
admit
*NL*
she
was
.
We
gave
them
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
their
chance
to
be
delighted
,
and
*NL*
they
've
walked
up
to
it
,
and
looked
all
round
it
,
and
not
taken
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
bring
a
horse
to
water
--
!
''
Chad
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
And
the
tune
to
which
this
morning
Sarah
was
n't
*NL*
delighted
--
the
tune
to
which
,
to
adopt
your
metaphor
,
she
refused
to
*NL*
drink
--
leaves
us
on
that
side
nothing
more
to
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
a
pause
,
and
then
as
if
consolingly
:
``
It
was
never
of
course
*NL*
really
the
least
on
the
cards
that
they
would
be
`
delighted
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
after
all
,
''
Strether
mused
.
``
I
've
had
to
come
as
*NL*
far
round
.
However
''
--
he
shook
it
off
--
``
it
's
doubtless
MY
performance
*NL*
that
's
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
certainly
moments
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
when
you
seem
to
me
too
good
*NL*
to
be
true
.
Yet
if
you
are
true
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
seems
to
be
all
that
*NL*
need
concern
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
true
,
but
I
'm
incredible
.
I
'm
fantastic
and
ridiculous
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
explain
myself
even
TO
myself
.
How
can
they
then
,
''
Strether
asked
,
*NL*
``
understand
me
?
So
I
do
n't
quarrel
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
They
quarrel
,
''
said
Chad
rather
comfortably
,
``
with
US
.
''
*NL*
Strether
noted
once
more
the
comfort
,
but
his
young
friend
had
already
*NL*
gone
on
.
``
I
should
feel
greatly
ashamed
,
all
the
same
,
if
I
did
n't
put
*NL*
it
before
you
again
that
you
ought
to
think
,
after
all
,
tremendously
*NL*
well
.
I
mean
before
giving
up
beyond
recall
--
''
With
which
insistence
,
*NL*
as
from
a
certain
delicacy
,
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
but
Strether
wanted
it
.
``
Say
it
all
,
say
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
at
your
age
,
and
with
what
--
when
all
's
said
and
done
--
Mother
*NL*
might
do
for
you
and
be
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
said
it
all
,
from
his
natural
scruple
,
only
to
that
extent
;
so
*NL*
that
Strether
after
an
instant
himself
took
a
hand
.
``
My
absence
of
an
*NL*
assured
future
.
The
little
I
have
to
show
toward
the
power
to
take
*NL*
care
of
myself
.
The
way
,
the
wonderful
way
,
she
would
certainly
take
*NL*
care
of
me
.
Her
fortune
,
her
kindness
,
and
the
constant
miracle
of
her
*NL*
having
been
disposed
to
go
even
so
far
.
Of
course
,
of
course
''
--
he
*NL*
summed
it
up
.
``
There
are
those
sharp
facts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
meanwhile
thought
of
another
still
.
``
And
do
n't
you
really
*NL*
care
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
slowly
turned
round
to
him
.
``
Will
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
if
you
'll
say
you
now
consider
I
should
.
You
know
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
``
I
was
ready
six
weeks
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
that
was
when
you
did
n't
know
I
was
n't
!
You
're
*NL*
ready
at
present
because
you
do
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
Chad
returned
;
``
but
all
the
same
I
'm
sincere
.
You
talk
*NL*
about
taking
the
whole
thing
on
your
shoulders
,
but
in
what
light
do
*NL*
you
regard
me
that
you
think
me
capable
of
letting
you
pay
?
''
Strether
*NL*
patted
his
arm
,
as
they
stood
together
against
the
parapet
,
*NL*
reassuringly
--
seeming
to
wish
to
contend
that
he
HAD
the
wherewithal
;
*NL*
but
it
was
again
round
this
question
of
purchase
and
price
that
the
*NL*
young
man
's
sense
of
fairness
continued
to
hover
.
``
What
it
literally
*NL*
comes
to
for
you
,
if
you
'll
pardon
my
putting
it
so
,
is
that
you
give
*NL*
up
money
.
Possibly
a
good
deal
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
Strether
laughed
,
``
if
it
were
only
just
enough
you
'd
still
be
*NL*
justified
in
putting
it
so
!
But
I
've
on
my
side
to
remind
you
too
that
*NL*
YOU
give
up
money
;
and
more
than
`
possibly
'
--
quite
certainly
,
as
I
*NL*
should
suppose
--
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
enough
;
but
I
've
got
a
certain
quantity
,
''
Chad
returned
after
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
Whereas
you
,
my
dear
man
,
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
at
all
said
''
--
Strether
took
him
up
--
``
to
have
a
`
quantity
'
*NL*
certain
or
uncertain
?
Very
true
.
Still
,
I
sha
n't
starve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
must
n't
STARVE
!
''
Chad
pacifically
emphasised
;
and
so
,
in
the
*NL*
pleasant
conditions
,
they
continued
to
talk
;
though
there
was
,
for
that
*NL*
matter
,
a
pause
in
which
the
younger
companion
might
have
been
taken
as
*NL*
weighing
again
the
delicacy
of
his
then
and
there
promising
the
elder
*NL*
some
provision
against
the
possibility
just
mentioned
.
This
,
however
,
*NL*
he
presumably
thought
best
not
to
do
,
for
at
the
end
of
another
minute
*NL*
they
had
moved
in
quite
a
different
direction
.
Strether
had
broken
in
*NL*
by
returning
to
the
subject
of
Chad
's
passage
with
Sarah
and
enquiring
*NL*
if
they
had
arrived
,
in
the
event
,
at
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
*NL*
``
scene
.
''
To
this
Chad
replied
that
they
had
on
the
contrary
kept
*NL*
tremendously
polite
;
adding
moreover
that
Sally
was
after
all
not
the
*NL*
woman
to
have
made
the
mistake
of
not
being
.
``
Her
hands
are
a
good
*NL*
deal
tied
,
you
see
.
I
got
so
,
from
the
first
,
''
he
sagaciously
*NL*
observed
,
``
the
start
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
she
has
taken
so
much
from
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
n't
of
course
in
common
decency
give
less
:
only
she
*NL*
had
n't
expected
,
I
think
,
that
I
'd
give
her
nearly
so
much
.
And
she
*NL*
began
to
take
it
before
she
knew
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
began
to
like
it
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
as
soon
as
she
began
to
*NL*
take
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
has
liked
it
--
also
more
than
she
expected
.
''
After
which
Chad
*NL*
observed
:
``
But
she
does
n't
like
ME
.
In
fact
she
hates
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
interest
grew
.
``
Then
why
does
she
want
you
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
when
you
hate
you
want
to
triumph
,
and
if
she
should
get
me
*NL*
neatly
stuck
there
she
WOULD
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
followed
afresh
,
but
looking
as
he
went
.
``
Certainly
--
in
a
*NL*
manner
.
But
it
would
scarce
be
a
triumph
worth
having
if
,
once
*NL*
entangled
,
feeling
her
dislike
and
possibly
conscious
in
time
of
a
*NL*
certain
quantity
of
your
own
,
you
should
on
the
spot
make
yourself
*NL*
unpleasant
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Chad
,
``
she
can
bear
ME
--
could
bear
me
at
least
at
home
.
It
's
*NL*
my
being
there
that
would
be
her
triumph
.
She
hates
me
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
hates
in
other
words
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
THAT
'S
it
!
''
--
Chad
had
quickly
understood
this
understanding
;
*NL*
which
formed
on
the
part
of
each
as
near
an
approach
as
they
had
yet
*NL*
made
to
naming
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
The
limitations
of
their
*NL*
distinctness
did
n't
,
however
,
prevent
its
fairly
lingering
in
the
air
*NL*
that
it
was
this
lady
Mrs.
Pocock
hated
.
It
added
one
more
touch
*NL*
moreover
to
their
established
recognition
of
the
rare
intimacy
of
*NL*
Chad
's
association
with
her
.
He
had
never
yet
more
twitched
away
the
*NL*
last
light
veil
from
this
phenomenon
than
in
presenting
himself
as
*NL*
confounded
and
submerged
in
the
feeling
she
had
created
at
Woollett
.
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
tell
you
who
hates
me
too
,
''
he
immediately
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
knew
as
immediately
whom
he
meant
,
but
with
as
prompt
a
*NL*
protest
.
``
Ah
no
!
Mamie
does
n't
hate
--
well
,
''
he
caught
himself
in
*NL*
time
--
``
anybody
at
all
.
Mamie
's
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
shook
his
head
.
``
That
's
just
why
I
mind
it
.
She
certainly
*NL*
does
n't
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
mind
it
?
What
would
you
do
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
like
her
if
she
'd
like
me
.
Really
,
really
,
''
Chad
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
his
companion
a
moment
's
pause
.
``
You
asked
me
just
now
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
,
as
you
said
,
`
care
'
about
a
certain
person
.
You
rather
tempt
me
*NL*
therefore
to
put
the
question
in
my
turn
.
Do
n't
YOU
care
about
a
*NL*
certain
other
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
looked
at
him
hard
in
the
lamplight
of
the
window
.
``
The
*NL*
difference
is
that
I
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wondered
.
''
`
Do
n't
want
'
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
try
not
to
--
that
is
I
HAVE
tried
.
I
've
done
my
best
.
You
ca
n't
be
*NL*
surprised
,
''
the
young
man
easily
went
on
,
``
when
you
yourself
set
me
on
*NL*
it
.
I
was
indeed
,
''
he
added
,
``
already
on
it
a
little
;
but
you
set
me
*NL*
harder
.
It
was
six
weeks
ago
that
I
thought
I
had
come
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
took
it
well
in
.
``
But
you
have
n't
come
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
it
's
what
I
WANT
to
know
,
''
said
Chad
.
``
And
if
I
could
*NL*
have
sufficiently
wanted
--
by
myself
--
to
go
back
,
I
think
I
might
have
*NL*
found
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
''
--
Strether
considered
.
``
But
all
you
were
able
to
achieve
was
*NL*
to
want
to
want
to
!
And
even
then
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
only
till
our
friends
*NL*
there
came
.
Do
you
want
to
want
to
still
?
''
As
with
a
sound
*NL*
half-dolorous
,
half-droll
and
all
vague
and
equivocal
,
Chad
buried
his
*NL*
face
for
a
little
in
his
hands
,
rubbing
it
in
a
whimsical
way
that
*NL*
amounted
to
an
evasion
,
he
brought
it
out
more
sharply
:
``
DO
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
kept
for
a
time
his
attitude
,
but
at
last
he
looked
up
,
and
then
*NL*
abruptly
,
``
Jim
IS
a
damned
dose
!
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
abuse
or
describe
or
in
any
way
pronounce
on
*NL*
your
relatives
;
I
simply
put
it
to
you
once
more
whether
you
're
NOW
*NL*
ready
.
You
say
you
've
`
seen
.
'
Is
what
you
've
seen
that
you
ca
n't
*NL*
resist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
gave
him
a
strange
smile
--
the
nearest
approach
he
had
ever
shown
*NL*
to
a
troubled
one
.
``
Ca
n't
you
make
me
NOT
resist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
it
comes
to
,
''
Strether
went
on
very
gravely
now
and
as
if
he
*NL*
had
n't
heard
him
,
``
what
it
comes
to
is
that
more
has
been
done
for
you
,
*NL*
I
think
,
than
I
've
ever
seen
done
--
attempted
perhaps
,
but
never
so
*NL*
successfully
done
--
by
one
human
being
for
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
an
immense
deal
certainly
''
--
Chad
did
it
full
justice
.
``
And
you
*NL*
yourself
are
adding
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
without
heeding
this
either
that
his
visitor
continued
.
``
And
our
*NL*
friends
there
wo
n't
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
simply
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
demand
you
on
the
basis
,
as
it
were
,
of
repudiation
and
*NL*
ingratitude
;
and
what
has
been
the
matter
with
me
,
''
Strether
went
on
,
*NL*
``
is
that
I
have
n't
seen
my
way
to
working
with
you
for
repudiation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
appreciated
this
.
``
Then
as
you
have
n't
seen
yours
you
naturally
*NL*
have
n't
seen
mine
.
There
it
is

''
After
which
he
proceeded
,
with
a
*NL*
certain
abruptness
,
to
a
sharp
interrogation
.
``
NOW
do
you
say
she
*NL*
does
n't
hate
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
''
`
She
'
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
Mother
.
We
called
it
Sarah
,
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
Strether
objected
,
``
not
to
the
same
thing
as
her
hating
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
--
though
as
if
for
an
instant
it
had
hung
fire
--
Chad
remarkably
*NL*
replied
:
``
Well
,
if
they
hate
my
good
friend
,
THAT
comes
to
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
''
It
had
a
note
of
inevitable
truth
that
made
Strether
take
it
as
*NL*
enough
,
feel
he
wanted
nothing
more
.
The
young
man
spoke
in
it
for
his
*NL*
``
good
friend
''
more
than
he
had
ever
yet
directly
spoken
,
confessed
to
*NL*
such
deep
identities
between
them
as
he
might
play
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
working
free
from
,
but
which
at
a
given
moment
could
still
draw
him
*NL*
down
like
a
whirlpool
.
And
meanwhile
he
had
gone
on
.
``
Their
hating
*NL*
you
too
moreover
--
that
also
comes
to
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
your
mother
does
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
,
however
,
loyally
stuck
to
it
--
loyally
,
that
is
,
to
Strether
.
``
She
*NL*
will
if
you
do
n't
look
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
look
out
.
I
am
,
after
all
,
looking
out
.
That
's
just
why
,
''
*NL*
our
friend
explained
,
``
I
want
to
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
drew
from
Chad
again
the
same
question
.
``
To
see
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
--
for
the
present
--
Sarah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
there
you
are
!
And
what
I
do
n't
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
,
''
*NL*
Chad
pursued
with
resigned
perplexity
,
``
is
what
you
GAIN
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
it
would
have
taken
his
companion
too
long
to
say
!
``
That
's
because
*NL*
you
have
,
I
verily
believe
,
no
imagination
.
You
've
other
qualities
.
*NL*
But
no
imagination
,
do
n't
you
see
?
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
.
I
do
see
.
''
It
was
an
idea
in
which
Chad
showed
interest
.
*NL*
``
But
have
n't
you
yourself
rather
too
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
RATHER
--
!
''
So
that
after
an
instant
,
under
this
reproach
and
as
if
*NL*
it
were
at
last
a
fact
really
to
escape
from
,
Strether
made
his
move
*NL*
for
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
features
of
the
restless
afternoon
passed
by
him
after
Mrs.
*NL*
Pocock
's
visit
was
an
hour
spent
,
shortly
before
dinner
,
with
Maria
*NL*
Gostrey
,
whom
of
late
,
in
spite
of
so
sustained
a
call
on
his
attention
*NL*
from
other
quarters
,
he
had
by
no
means
neglected
.
And
that
he
was
*NL*
still
not
neglecting
her
will
appear
from
the
fact
that
he
was
with
her
*NL*
again
at
the
same
hour
on
the
very
morrow
--
with
no
less
fine
a
*NL*
consciousness
moreover
of
being
able
to
hold
her
ear
.
It
continued
*NL*
inveterately
to
occur
,
for
that
matter
,
that
whenever
he
had
taken
one
*NL*
of
his
greater
turns
he
came
back
to
where
she
so
faithfully
awaited
*NL*
him
.
None
of
these
excursions
had
on
the
whole
been
livelier
than
the
*NL*
pair
of
incidents
--
the
fruit
of
the
short
interval
since
his
previous
*NL*
visit
--
on
which
he
had
now
to
report
to
her
.
He
had
seen
Chad
Newsome
*NL*
late
the
night
before
,
and
he
had
had
that
morning
,
as
a
sequel
to
this
*NL*
conversation
,
a
second
interview
with
Sarah
.
``
But
they
're
all
off
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
puzzled
her
a
moment
.
``
All
?
--
Mr.
Newsome
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
not
yet
!
Sarah
and
Jim
and
Mamie
.
But
Waymarsh
with
them
--
for
*NL*
Sarah
.
It
's
too
beautiful
,
''
Strether
continued
;
``
I
find
I
do
n't
get
*NL*
over
that
--
it
's
always
a
fresh
joy
.
But
it
's
a
fresh
joy
too
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
that
--
well
,
what
do
you
think
?
Little
Bilham
also
goes
.
But
he
*NL*
of
course
goes
for
Mamie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
wondered
.
''
`
For
'
her
?
Do
you
mean
they
're
already
*NL*
engaged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
say
then
for
ME
.
He
'll
do
anything
for
me
;
*NL*
just
as
I
will
,
for
that
matter
--
anything
I
can
--
for
him
.
Or
for
Mamie
*NL*
either
.
SHE
'LL
do
anything
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
gave
a
comprehensive
sigh
.
``
The
way
you
reduce
people
to
*NL*
subjection
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
certainly
,
on
one
side
,
wonderful
.
But
it
's
quite
equalled
,
on
*NL*
another
,
by
the
way
I
do
n't
.
I
have
n't
reduced
Sarah
,
since
yesterday
;
*NL*
though
I
've
succeeded
in
seeing
her
again
,
as
I
'll
presently
tell
you
.
*NL*
The
others
however
are
really
all
right
.
Mamie
,
by
that
blessed
law
of
*NL*
ours
,
absolutely
must
have
a
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
must
poor
Mr.
Bilham
have
?
Do
you
mean
they
'll
MARRY
for
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
,
by
the
same
blessed
law
,
it
wo
n't
matter
a
grain
if
they
*NL*
do
n't
--
I
sha
n't
have
in
the
least
to
worry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
as
usual
what
he
meant
.
``
And
Mr.
Jim
?
--
who
goes
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
Strether
had
to
admit
,
``
I
could
n't
manage
THAT
.
He
's
thrown
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
on
the
world
;
the
world
which
,
after
all
,
by
his
account
--
for
he
*NL*
has
prodigious
adventures
--
seems
very
good
to
him
.
He
*NL*
fortunately
--
`
over
here
,
'
as
he
says
--
finds
the
world
everywhere
;
and
*NL*
his
most
prodigious
adventure
of
all
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
has
been
of
course
*NL*
of
the
last
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
,
already
knowing
,
instantly
made
the
connexion
.
``
He
has
*NL*
seen
Marie
de
Vionnet
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
,
all
by
himself
,
the
day
after
Chad
's
party
--
did
n't
I
tell
*NL*
you
?
--
to
tea
with
her
.
By
her
invitation
--
all
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
like
yourself
!
''
Maria
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
he
's
more
wonderful
about
her
than
I
am
!
''
And
then
as
his
*NL*
friend
showed
how
she
could
believe
it
,
filling
it
out
,
fitting
it
on
*NL*
to
old
memories
of
the
wonderful
woman
:
``
What
I
should
have
liked
to
*NL*
manage
would
have
been
HER
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Switzerland
with
the
party
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Jim
--
and
for
symmetry
.
If
it
had
been
workable
moreover
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
she
'd
have
gone
.
She
's
ready
''
--
he
followed
up
his
renewed
*NL*
vision
of
her
--
``
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
went
with
him
a
minute
.
``
She
's
too
perfect
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
WILL
,
I
think
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
go
to-night
to
the
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
him
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Chad
--
marvellously
--
as
part
of
their
general
attention
.
And
she
*NL*
does
it
''
--
it
kept
before
him
--
``
with
a
light
,
light
grace
,
a
free
,
free
*NL*
gaiety
,
that
may
well
softly
bewilder
Mr.
Pocock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
kept
her
so
before
him
that
his
companion
had
after
an
instant
a
*NL*
friendly
comment
.
``
As
in
short
it
has
softly
bewildered
a
saner
man
.
*NL*
Are
you
really
in
love
with
her
?
''
Maria
threw
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
of
no
importance
I
should
know
,
''
he
replied
.
``
It
matters
so
*NL*
little
--
has
nothing
to
do
,
practically
,
with
either
of
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
''
--
Maria
continued
to
smile
--
``
they
go
,
the
five
,
as
I
*NL*
understand
you
,
and
you
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
stay

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
and
Chad
.
''
To
which
Strether
added
:
``
And
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
`
me
'
!
''
--
she
gave
a
small
impatient
wail
again
,
in
which
something
*NL*
of
the
unreconciled
seemed
suddenly
to
break
out
.
``
I
do
n't
stay
,
it
*NL*
somehow
seems
to
me
,
much
to
my
advantage
.
In
the
presence
of
all
you
*NL*
cause
to
pass
before
me
I
've
a
tremendous
sense
of
privation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
hesitated
.
``
But
your
privation
,
your
keeping
out
of
*NL*
everything
,
has
been
--
has
n't
it
?

by
your
own
choice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
it
has
been
necessary
--
that
is
it
has
been
better
for
you
.
*NL*
What
I
mean
is
only
that
I
seem
to
have
ceased
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
tell
that
?
''
he
asked
.
``
You
do
n't
know
how
you
serve
me
.
*NL*
When
you
cease
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
she
said
as
he
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
LET
you
know
.
Be
quiet
till
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
moment
.
``
Then
you
positively
like
me
to
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
treat
you
as
if
I
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
certainly
very
kind
to
me

But
that
,
''
said
Maria
,
``
is
for
*NL*
myself

It
's
getting
late
,
as
you
see
,
and
Paris
turning
rather
hot
*NL*
and
dusty
.
People
are
scattering
,
and
some
of
them
,
in
other
places
*NL*
want
me
.
But
if
you
want
me
here
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
spoken
as
resigned
to
his
word
,
but
he
had
of
a
sudden
a
still
*NL*
sharper
sense
than
he
would
have
expected
of
desiring
not
to
lose
her
.
*NL*
``
I
want
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
as
if
the
words
were
all
she
had
wished
;
as
if
they
brought
*NL*
her
,
gave
her
something
that
was
the
compensation
of
her
case
.
``
Thank
*NL*
you
,
''
she
simply
answered
.
And
then
as
he
looked
at
her
a
little
*NL*
harder
,
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
broken
as
with
a
slight
arrest
into
the
current
of
their
talk
,
*NL*
and
it
held
him
a
moment
longer
.
``
Why
,
two
months
,
or
whatever
the
*NL*
time
was
,
ago
,
did
you
so
suddenly
dash
off
?
The
reason
you
afterwards
*NL*
gave
me
for
having
kept
away
three
weeks
was
n't
the
real
one
.

*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
.
``
I
never
supposed
you
believed
it
was

Yet
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
``
if
you
did
n't
guess
it
that
was
just
what
helped
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
from
her
on
this
;
he
indulged
,
so
far
as
space
*NL*
permitted
,
in
one
of
his
slow
absences
.
``
I
've
often
thought
of
it
,
but
*NL*
never
to
feel
that
I
could
guess
it

And
you
see
the
consideration
*NL*
with
which
I
've
treated
you
in
never
asking
till
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
why
DO
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
show
you
how
I
miss
you
when
you
're
not
here

what
it
does
for
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
seem
to
have
done

''
she
laughed
,
``
all
it
might
!
However
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
``
if
you
've
really
never
guessed
the
truth
I
'll
tell
it
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
guessed
it

Strether
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
I
dashed
off
,
as
you
say
,
so
as
not
to
have
the
confusion
of
*NL*
being
there
if
Marie
de
Vionnet
should
tell
you
anything
to
my
*NL*
detriment
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
as
if
he
considerably
doubted
.
``
You
even
then
would
have
had
*NL*
to
face
it
on
your
return

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
if
I
had
found
reason
to
believe
it
something
very
bad
I
'd
have
*NL*
left
you
altogether

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
,
''
he
continued
,
``
it
was
only
on
guessing
she
had
been
on
the
*NL*
whole
merciful
that
you
ventured
back
?

*NL*
*NL*
Maria
kept
it
together
.
``
I
owe
her
thanks

Whatever
her
temptation
*NL*
she
did
n't
separate
us

That
's
one
of
my
reasons

she
went
on
``
for
*NL*
admiring
her
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
pass
then

said
Strether
,
``

temptation

naturally

to
think
too
long

saw
she
*NL*
could
have
you
without
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
`
have
'
me
!
''
Strether
a
trifle
ambiguously
sighed
.
``
YOU
,
''
he
*NL*
handsomely
declared
,
``
would
have
had
me
at
any
rate
WITH
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
`
have
'
you
!
''
--
she
echoed
it
as
he
had
done
.
``
I
do
have
you
,
*NL*
however
,
''
she
less
ironically
said
,
``
from
the
moment
you
express
a
*NL*
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
before
her
,
full
of
the
disposition
.
``
I
'll
express
fifty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
indeed
begot
in
her
,
with
a
certain
inconsequence
,
a
return
of
*NL*
her
small
wail
.
``
Ah
there
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
if
it
were
so
,
he
continued
for
the
rest
of
the
time
to
be
,
and
*NL*
it
was
as
if
to
show
her
how
she
could
still
serve
him
that
,
coming
*NL*
back
to
the
departure
of
the
Pococks
,
he
gave
her
the
view
,
vivid
with
*NL*
a
hundred
more
touches
than
we
can
reproduce
,
of
what
had
happened
for
*NL*
him
that
morning
.
He
had
had
ten
minutes
with
Sarah
at
her
hotel
,
ten
*NL*
minutes
reconquered
,
by
irresistible
pressure
,
from
the
time
over
which
*NL*
he
had
already
described
her
to
Miss
Gostrey
as
having
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
their
interview
on
his
own
premises
,
passed
the
great
sponge
of
the
*NL*
future
.
He
had
caught
her
by
not
announcing
himself
,
had
found
her
in
*NL*
her
sitting-room
with
a
dressmaker
and
a
lingere
whose
accounts
she
*NL*
appeared
to
have
been
more
or
less
ingenuously
settling
and
who
soon
*NL*
withdrew
.
Then
he
had
explained
to
her
how
he
had
succeeded
,
late
the
*NL*
night
before
,
in
keeping
his
promise
of
seeing
Chad
.
``
I
told
her
I
'd
*NL*
take
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
`
take
'
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
if
he
does
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
waited
.
``
And
who
takes
it
if
he
does
?
''
she
enquired
with
a
*NL*
certain
grimness
of
gaiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
I
think
I
take
,
in
any
event
,
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
which
I
suppose
you
mean
,
''
his
companion
brought
out
after
a
*NL*
moment
,
``
that
you
definitely
understand
you
now
lose
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
before
her
again
.
``
It
does
come
perhaps
to
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
But
Chad
,
now
that
he
has
seen
,
does
n't
really
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
believe
that
,
but
she
made
,
as
always
,
for
clearness
.
``
Still
,
*NL*
what
,
after
all
,
HAS
he
seen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
they
want
of
him
.
And
it
's
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
contrasts
so
unfavourably
with
what
Madame
de
Vionnet
wants
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
contrasts
--
just
so
;
all
round
,
and
tremendously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
perhaps
,
most
of
all
with
what
YOU
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
what
I
want
is
a
thing
I
've
ceased
to
measure
or
*NL*
even
to
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
friend
none
the
less
went
on
.
``
Do
you
want
Mrs.
Newsome
--
after
*NL*
such
a
way
of
treating
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
straighter
mode
of
dealing
with
this
lady
than
they
had
as
*NL*
yet
--
such
was
their
high
form
--
permitted
themselves
;
but
it
seemed
not
*NL*
wholly
for
this
that
he
delayed
a
moment
.
``
I
dare
say
it
has
been
,
*NL*
after
all
,
the
only
way
she
could
have
imagined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
does
that
make
you
want
her
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
tremendously
disappointed
her
,
''
Strether
thought
it
worth
while
*NL*
to
mention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
have
.
That
's
rudimentary
;
that
was
plain
to
us
long
*NL*
ago
.
But
is
n't
it
almost
as
plain
,
''
Maria
went
on
,
``
that
you
've
even
*NL*
yet
your
straight
remedy
?
Really
drag
him
away
,
as
I
believe
you
still
*NL*
can
,
and
you
'd
cease
to
have
to
count
with
her
disappointment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
then
,
''
he
laughed
,
``
I
should
have
to
count
with
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
barely
struck
her
now
.
``
What
,
in
that
case
,
should
you
call
*NL*
counting
?
You
have
n't
come
out
where
you
are
,
I
think
,
to
please
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
insisted
,
``
that
too
,
you
know
,
has
been
part
of
it
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
separate
--
it
's
all
one
;
and
that
's
perhaps
why
,
as
I
say
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
.
''
But
he
was
ready
to
declare
again
that
this
did
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
matter
;
all
the
more
that
,
as
he
affirmed
,
he
HAD
n't
really
as
*NL*
yet
``
come
out
.
''
``
She
gives
me
after
all
,
on
its
coming
to
the
pinch
,
a
*NL*
last
mercy
,
another
chance
.
They
do
n't
sail
,
you
see
,
for
five
or
six
*NL*
weeks
more
,
and
they
have
n't
--
she
admits
that
--
expected
Chad
would
take
*NL*
part
in
their
tour
.
It
's
still
open
to
him
to
join
them
,
at
the
last
,
*NL*
at
Liverpool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Gostrey
considered
.
``
How
in
the
world
is
it
`
open
'
unless
you
*NL*
open
it
?
How
can
he
join
them
at
Liverpool
if
he
but
sinks
deeper
into
*NL*
his
situation
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
given
her
--
as
I
explained
to
you
that
she
let
me
know
*NL*
yesterday
--
his
word
of
honour
to
do
as
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
stared
.
``
But
if
you
say
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
he
as
usual
walked
about
on
it
.
``
I
did
say
something
this
*NL*
morning
.
I
gave
her
my
answer
--
the
word
I
had
promised
her
after
*NL*
hearing
from
himself
what
HE
had
promised
.
What
she
demanded
of
me
*NL*
yesterday
,
you
'll
remember
,
was
the
engagement
then
and
there
to
make
*NL*
him
take
up
this
vow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
enquired
,
``
was
the
purpose
of
your
visit
to
*NL*
her
only
to
decline
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
was
to
ask
,
odd
as
that
may
seem
to
you
,
for
another
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
weak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
!
''
She
had
spoken
with
impatience
,
but
,
so
far
as
that
at
*NL*
least
,
he
knew
where
he
was
.
``
If
I
AM
weak
I
want
to
find
it
out
.
If
*NL*
I
do
n't
find
it
out
I
shall
have
the
comfort
,
the
little
glory
,
of
*NL*
thinking
I
'm
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
comfort
,
I
judge
,
''
she
returned
,
``
that
you
WILL
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
will
have
been
a
month
more
.
Paris
may
*NL*
grow
,
from
day
to
day
,
hot
and
dusty
,
as
you
say
;
but
there
are
other
*NL*
things
that
are
hotter
and
dustier
.
I
'm
not
afraid
to
stay
on
;
the
*NL*
summer
here
must
be
amusing
in
a
wild
--
if
it
is
n't
a
tame
--
way
of
its
*NL*
own
;
the
place
at
no
time
more
picturesque
.
I
think
I
shall
like
it
.
*NL*
And
then
,
''
he
benevolently
smiled
for
her
,
``
there
will
be
always
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
objected
,
``
it
wo
n't
be
as
a
part
of
the
picturesqueness
that
*NL*
I
shall
stay
,
for
I
shall
be
the
plainest
thing
about
you
.
You
may
,
you
*NL*
see
,
at
any
rate
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
have
nobody
else
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
*NL*
may
very
well
be
going
off
,
may
n't
she
?
--
and
Mr.
Newsome
by
the
same
*NL*
stroke
:
unless
indeed
you
've
had
an
assurance
from
them
to
the
*NL*
contrary
.
So
that
if
your
idea
's
to
stay
for
them
''
--
it
was
her
duty
to
*NL*
suggest
it
--
``
you
may
be
left
in
the
lurch
.
Of
course
if
they
do
*NL*
stay
''
--
she
kept
it
up
--
``
they
would
be
part
of
the
picturesqueness
.
Or
*NL*
else
indeed
you
might
join
them
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
to
face
it
as
if
it
were
a
happy
thought
;
but
the
next
*NL*
moment
he
spoke
more
critically
.
``
Do
you
mean
that
they
'll
probably
go
*NL*
off
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
just
considered
.
``
I
think
it
will
be
treating
you
quite
without
*NL*
ceremony
if
they
do
;
though
after
all
,
''
she
added
,
``
it
would
be
*NL*
difficult
to
see
now
quite
what
degree
of
ceremony
properly
meets
your
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
Strether
conceded
,
``
my
attitude
toward
them
is
*NL*
extraordinary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
;
so
that
one
may
ask
one
's
self
what
style
of
proceeding
on
*NL*
their
own
part
can
altogether
match
it
.
The
attitude
of
their
own
that
*NL*
wo
n't
pale
in
its
light
they
've
doubtless
still
to
work
out
.
The
*NL*
really
handsome
thing
perhaps
,
''
she
presently
threw
off
,
``
WOULD
be
for
*NL*
them
to
withdraw
into
more
secluded
conditions
,
offering
at
the
same
*NL*
time
to
share
them
with
you
.
''
He
looked
at
her
,
on
this
,
as
if
some
*NL*
generous
irritation
--
all
in
his
interest
--
had
suddenly
again
flickered
*NL*
in
her
;
and
what
she
next
said
indeed
half-explained
it
.
``
Do
n't
really
*NL*
be
afraid
to
tell
me
if
what
now
holds
you
IS
the
pleasant
prospect
of
*NL*
the
empty
town
,
with
plenty
of
seats
in
the
shade
,
cool
drinks
,
*NL*
deserted
museums
,
drives
to
the
Bois
in
the
evening
,
and
our
wonderful
*NL*
woman
all
to
yourself
.
''
And
she
kept
it
up
still
more
.
``
The
handsomest
*NL*
thing
of
ALL
,
when
one
makes
it
out
,
would
,
I
dare
say
,
be
that
Mr.
*NL*
Chad
should
for
a
while
go
off
by
himself
.
It
's
a
pity
,
from
that
*NL*
point
of
view
,
''
she
wound
up
,
``
that
he
does
n't
pay
his
mother
a
visit
.
*NL*
It
would
at
least
occupy
your
interval
.
''
The
thought
in
fact
held
her
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
Why
does
n't
he
pay
his
mother
a
visit
?
Even
a
week
,
at
this
*NL*
good
moment

would
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
lady
,
''
Strether
replied
--
and
he
had
it
even
to
himself
*NL*
surprisingly
ready
--
``
my
dear
lady
,
his
mother
has
paid
HIM
a
visit

*NL*
Mrs.
Newsome
has
been
with
him
,
this
month
,
with
an
intensity
that
I
'm
*NL*
sure
he
has
thoroughly
felt
;
he
has
lavishly
entertained
her
,
and
she
*NL*
has
let
him
have
her
thanks
.
Do
you
suggest
he
shall
go
back
for
more
*NL*
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
succeeded
after
a
little
in
shaking
it
off
.
``
I
see
.
It
's
*NL*
what
you
do
n't
suggest

what
you
have
n't
suggested

you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
you

he
kindly
said

so
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
seen

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Sarah

both
for

has
served
all
the

purpose

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
served
it
in
a
manner

she
responsively
mused
,
``
so
extraordinary
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
''
he
partly
explained
,
``
what
it
comes
to
is
that
she
's
*NL*
all
cold
thought

which
Sarah
could
serve
to
us
cold
without
its
really
*NL*
losing
anything

So
it
is
that
we
know
what
she
thinks
of
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
had
followed
,
but
she
had
an
arrest
.
``
What
I
've
never
made
out

what

you
so
much
,
when
all
's
said
,
as
care
a
little
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
he
answered
with
no
loss
of
promptness
,
``
is
what
even
Chad
*NL*
himself
asked
me
last
night

He
asked
me
if

do
n't
mind
the
*NL*
loss

well

the
loss
of
an
opulent
future

moreover

he
*NL*
hastened
to
add
,

was
a

natural
question

*NL*
*NL*

call
your

said
Miss
Gostrey
,
``
to
the
fact

I
venture
to
ask

whether
it

to
Mrs.

Newsome
herself
that
you
're
indifferent

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
been
so

he
spoke
with
all
assurance

``
I
've
been
the
very

from

preoccupied

impression
everything
might
be
making
on

quite
oppressed

haunted

tormented

it

I

been
interested

And
I
've
been
as
disappointed

refusal

see
it

she

has
been
in
what
has
appeared
to
her
the

*NL*
``
Do

shocked
her

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
weighed
it
.
``
I
'm
probably
not
so
shockable
.
But
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
I
've
gone
much
further
to
meet
her
.
She
,
on
her
side
,
has
n't
*NL*
budged
an
inch
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
you
're
now
at
last

Maria
pointed
the
moral
--
``
in
the
sad
*NL*
stage
of
recriminations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
's
only
to
you

speak

I
've
been
like
a
lamb
to
Sarah

*NL*
only
put
my
back
to
the
wall

It
's
to
THAT
one
naturally
staggers
when
*NL*
one
has
been
violently
pushed
there

*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
him
a
moment
.
``
Thrown
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
I
feel
I
've
landed
somewhere

think
I
must
have
been
thrown

*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
it
over
,
but
as
hoping
to
clarify
much
rather
than
to
*NL*
harmonise
.
``
The
thing
is
that
I
suppose
you
've
been
disappointing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
from
the
very
first
of
my
arrival

I
dare
say

I
admit
I
was
*NL*
surprising
even
to
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
of
course
,
''
Maria
went
on
,
``
I
had
much
to
do
with
it

*NL*
``
With
my
being
surprising

laughed

delicate

call
it
MY

she
added
,

you
came
over
more

less
for

surprises

*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally

he
valued
the
reminder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

they
were
to
have
been
all
for
you

she
continued
to
piece
it
*NL*
out

``
and
none
of
them
for
HER

''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
he
stopped
before
her
as
if
she
had
touched
the
point
.
*NL*
``
That
's
just
her
difficulty

a

I

it
falls
in

She
had

her

worked
the
whole

out

out

filled

hold

get
anything
more

out

What
it
comes
to

Strether
,

that

intellectually

get
rid

Maria
returned

what

her

threw
back
his

see
it
now

she
hangs
together

with
a
perfection

her
own

he
went
on
,
``
that
does
suggest
a
kind
of

wrong
in
ANY
change

was
at

he
wound
*NL*
up
,
``
the

you
call

being

brought
me
over
to
take
or
to

leave

*NL*
*NL*
It
turned
Miss
Gostrey
to
deeper
thought
.
``
Fancy

*NL*

*NL*
``

never

a

may

it
looms
up

has
been
looming
for

at

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

he
absently
echoed
,
while
his
eyes
might
have
been

fixing
some
particularly
large
iceberg
in
a
cool
blue
northern
sea

*NL*
``
It

he
then
rather
oddly
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
friend
,
who
was
used
to
this
kind
of
inconsequence
in
him
,
kept
*NL*
the
thread
.
``
There
's
nothing
so
magnificent

for
making
others
feel

you

as
to
have
no
imagination

*NL*
*NL*
It
brought
him
straight
round
.
``

there
you
are

Then
it

he
added

as

she
said

monstrous

struck
him

*NL*
*NL*

all

apropos
of

Maria
went
on

did
the

come
up

*NL*
*NL*

Well

of
his

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
pause
.
``
Then
as
I
've
asked
you
too
it
settles
my
case

Oh
*NL*
you
HAVE

she
repeated
,
``
treasures

*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
been
for
an
instant
thinking
away
from
this
,
and
he
came
up
*NL*
in
another
place
.
``
And
yet
Mrs.
Newsome
--
it
's
a
thing
to
remember

HAS
*NL*
imagined

,
imagine
,
and
apparently
still
does
,
horrors
*NL*
about
what
I
should
have
found
.
I
was
booked
,
by
her
*NL*
vision

extraordinarily
intense
,
after
all

to
find
them
;
and
that
I
*NL*
did
n't
,
that
I
could
n't

as
she
evidently
felt

I
would

this
*NL*
evidently
did
n't
at
all
,
as
they
say
,
`
suit

her
book

It
was
more
than
*NL*
she
could
bear
.
That
was
her
disappointment

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
you
were
to
have
found
Chad
himself
horrible

I
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Horrible

``
Found
her

And
Strether
paused
as
if
for
his
own
*NL*
expression
of
it
he
could
add
no
touch
to
that
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
had
meanwhile
thought
.
``
She
imagined
stupidly
--
so
it
*NL*
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupidly
?
Oh
!

said
Strether
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
insisted

``
She
imagined
meanly

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
it
,
however
,
better
.
``
It
could
n't
but
be
ignorantly

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
intensity
with
ignorance

what
do
you
want
worse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
might
have
held
him
,
but
he
let
it
pass
.
``
Sarah
is
n't
*NL*
ignorant
--
now
;
she
keeps
up
the
theory
of
the
horrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
she
's
intense

and
that
by
itself
will
do
sometimes
as
well

If
*NL*
it
does
n't
do
,
in
this
case
,
at
any
rate
,
to
deny
that
Marie
's
*NL*
charming

it
will
do
at

to
deny
that
she
's
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
claim
is
that
she
's
good
for

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

she
seemed
to
like
it
clear

``

she
's
good

YOU

*NL*
*NL*
But
he
continued
without
heeding
.
``
That
's
what
I
wanted

come

out

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do

Strether
presently
admitted
,
``
that
she
's
on
the
whole

about

But
they
're
consistent

they
've

clear
view

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you

Maria

all
responsive

confined
the
question
*NL*
for
the
moment

``

eliminate
from

shadow

thereby
a
little
less
portentous
--
of
the
person
whose
confederate
*NL*
you
've
suffered
yourself
to
become

However
,
that
's
comparatively
*NL*
simple

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
easily
at

give
you
up

The
irony
was
so
*NL*
obvious
that
it
needed
no
care
.

can
easily
at
the

*NL*
She
took
it
in
silence
and
without
attenuation
--
as
if
perhaps
from
very
*NL*
familiarity
with
the
facts
;
and
her
thought
made
a
connexion
without
*NL*
showing
the
links
.
``
Do
you
remember
how
we
used
to
talk
at
Chester

in
London

She
spoke
as
of
far-off

things
and
as
if
they
had
spent
weeks
at
the
places
she
named

*NL*
``
Yes

had
hesitated

she
waited

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
as
long
as
I

She
also
debated
``

we
were

saying

leave

do
you
think
you
can
bear
it
without

them

*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
reply
to
this
was
at
first
another
question
.
``
Do
you
mean
*NL*
in
order
to
get
away
from
me

*NL*
Her
answer
had
an
abruptness
.
``

rude

*NL*
He
looked
at
her
hard
again
--
seemed
even
for
an
instant
to
have
an
*NL*
intensity
of
thought
under
which
his
colour
changed
.
But
he
smiled
.
*NL*
``
You
mean
after
what
they
've
done
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
After
what
SHE
has

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
however
,
with
a
laugh
,
he
was
all
right
again

Ah

He
had
taken
the
train
a
few
days
after
this
from
a
station
--
as
well
as
*NL*
to
a
station
--
selected
almost
at
random
;
such
days
,
whatever
should
*NL*
happen
,
were
numbered
,
and
he
had
gone
forth
under
the
impulse
--
artless
*NL*
enough
,
no
doubt
--
to
give
the
whole
of
one
of
them
to
that
French
*NL*
ruralism
,
with
its
cool
special
green
,
into
which
he
had
hitherto
*NL*
looked
only
through
the
little
oblong
window
of
the
picture-frame
.
It
*NL*
had
been
as
yet
for
the
most
part
but
a
land
of
fancy
for
him
--
the
*NL*
background
of
fiction
,
the
medium
of
art
,
the
nursery
of
letters
;
*NL*
practically
as
distant
as
Greece
,
but
practically
also
well-nigh
as
*NL*
consecrated
.
Romance
could
weave
itself
,
for
Strether
's
sense
,
out
of
*NL*
elements
mild
enough
;
and
even
after
what
he
had
,
as
he
felt
,
lately
*NL*
``
been
through
,
''
he
could
thrill
a
little
at
the
chance
of
seeing
*NL*
something
somewhere
that
would
remind
him
of
a
certain
small
Lambinet
*NL*
that
had
charmed
him
,
long
years
before
,
at
a
Boston
dealer
's
and
that
*NL*
he
had
quite
absurdly
never
forgotten
.
It
had
been
offered
,
he
*NL*
remembered
,
at
a
price
he
had
been
instructed
to
believe
the
lowest
*NL*
ever
named
for
a
Lambinet
,
a
price
he
had
never
felt
so
poor
as
on
*NL*
having
to
recognise
,
all
the
same
,
as
beyond
a
dream
of
possibility
.
He
*NL*
had
dreamed
--
had
turned
and
twisted
possibilities
for
an
hour
:
it
had
*NL*
been
the
only
adventure
of
his
life
in
connexion
with
the
purchase
of
a
*NL*
work
of
art
.
The
adventure
,
it
will
be
perceived
,
was
modest
;
but
the
*NL*
memory
,
beyond
all
reason
and
by
some
accident
of
association
,
was
*NL*
sweet
.
The
little
Lambinet
abode
with
him
as
the
picture
he
WOULD
have
*NL*
bought
--
the
particular
production
that
had
made
him
for
the
moment
*NL*
overstep
the
modesty
of
nature
.
He
was
quite
aware
that
if
he
were
to
*NL*
see
it
again
he
should
perhaps
have
a
drop
or
a
shock
,
and
he
never
*NL*
found
himself
wishing
that
the
wheel
of
time
would
turn
it
up
again
,
*NL*
just
as
he
had
seen
it
in
the
maroon-coloured
,
sky-lighted
inner
shrine
*NL*
of
Tremont
Street
.
It
would
be
a
different
thing
,
however
,
to
see
the
*NL*
remembered
mixture
resolved
back
into
its
elements
--
to
assist
at
the
*NL*
restoration
to
nature
of
the
whole
far-away
hour
:
the
dusty
day
in
*NL*
Boston
,
the
background
of
the
Fitchburg
Depot
,
of
the
maroon-coloured
*NL*
sanctum
,
the
special-green
vision
,
the
ridiculous
price
,
the
poplars
,
*NL*
the
willows
,
the
rushes
,
the
river
,
the
sunny
silvery
sky
,
the
shady
*NL*
woody
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
observed
in
respect
to
his
train
almost
no
condition
save
that
it
*NL*
should
stop
a
few
times
after
getting
out
of
the
banlieue
;
he
threw
*NL*
himself
on
the
general
amiability
of
the
day
for
the
hint
of
where
to
*NL*
alight
.
His
theory
of
his
excursion
was
that
he
could
alight
*NL*
anywhere
--
not
nearer
Paris
than
an
hour
's
run
--
on
catching
a
suggestion
*NL*
of
the
particular
note
required
.
It
made
its
sign
,
the
*NL*
suggestion
--
weather
,
air
,
light
,
colour
and
his
mood
all
favouring
--
at
*NL*
the
end
of
some
eighty
minutes
;
the
train
pulled
up
just
at
the
right
*NL*
spot
,
and
he
found
himself
getting
out
as
securely
as
if
to
keep
an
*NL*
appointment
.
It
will
be
felt
of
him
that
he
could
amuse
himself
,
at
*NL*
his
age
,
with
very
small
things
if
it
be
again
noted
that
his
*NL*
appointment
was
only
with
a
superseded
Boston
fashion
.
He
had
n't
gone
*NL*
far
without
the
quick
confidence
that
it
would
be
quite
sufficiently
*NL*
kept
.
The
oblong
gilt
frame
disposed
its
enclosing
lines
;
the
poplars
*NL*
and
willows
,
the
reeds
and
river
--
a
river
of
which
he
did
n't
know
,
and
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
know
,
the
name
--
fell
into
a
composition
,
full
of
*NL*
felicity
,
within
them
;
the
sky
was
silver
and
turquoise
and
varnish
;
*NL*
the
village
on
the
left
was
white
and
the
church
on
the
right
was
grey
;
*NL*
it
was
all
there
,
in
short
--
it
was
what
he
wanted
:
it
was
Tremont
*NL*
Street
,
it
was
France
,
it
was
Lambinet
.
Moreover
he
was
freely
walking
*NL*
about
in
it
.
He
did
this
last
,
for
an
hour
,
to
his
heart
's
content
,
*NL*
making
for
the
shady
woody
horizon
and
boring
so
deep
into
his
*NL*
impression
and
his
idleness
that
he
might
fairly
have
got
through
them
*NL*
again
and
reached
the
maroon-coloured
wall
.
It
was
a
wonder
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
that
the
taste
of
idleness
for
him
should
n't
need
more
time
to
sweeten
;
*NL*
but
it
had
in
fact
taken
the
few
previous
days
;
it
had
been
sweetening
*NL*
in
truth
ever
since
the
retreat
of
the
Pococks
.
He
walked
and
walked
as
*NL*
if
to
show
himself
how
little
he
had
now
to
do
;
he
had
nothing
to
do
*NL*
but
turn
off
to
some
hillside
where
he
might
stretch
himself
and
hear
*NL*
the
poplars
rustle
,
and
whence
--
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
so
spent
,
*NL*
an
afternoon
richly
suffused
too
with
the
sense
of
a
book
in
his
*NL*
pocket
--
he
should
sufficiently
command
the
scene
to
be
able
to
pick
out
*NL*
just
the
right
little
rustic
inn
for
an
experiment
in
respect
to
*NL*
dinner
.
There
was
a
train
back
to
Paris
at
9.20
,
and
he
saw
himself
*NL*
partaking
,
at
the
close
of
the
day
,
with
the
enhancements
of
a
coarse
*NL*
white
cloth
and
a
sanded
door
,
of
something
fried
and
felicitous
,
*NL*
washed
down
with
authentic
wine
;
after
which
he
might
,
as
he
liked
,
*NL*
either
stroll
back
to
his
station
in
the
gloaming
or
propose
for
the
*NL*
local
carriole
and
converse
with
his
driver
,
a
driver
who
naturally
*NL*
would
n't
fail
of
a
stiff
clean
blouse
,
of
a
knitted
nightcap
and
of
the
*NL*
genius
of
response
--
who
,
in
fine
,
would
sit
on
the
shafts
,
tell
him
*NL*
what
the
French
people
were
thinking
,
and
remind
him
,
as
indeed
the
*NL*
whole
episode
would
incidentally
do
,
of
Maupassant
.
Strether
heard
his
*NL*
lips
,
for
the
first
time
in
French
air
,
as
this
vision
assumed
*NL*
consistency
,
emit
sounds
of
expressive
intention
without
fear
of
his
*NL*
company
.
He
had
been
afraid
of
Chad
and
of
Maria
and
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
;
he
had
been
most
of
all
afraid
of
Waymarsh
,
in
whose
presence
,
*NL*
so
far
as
they
had
mixed
together
in
the
light
of
the
town
,
he
had
*NL*
never
without
somehow
paying
for
it
aired
either
his
vocabulary
or
his
*NL*
accent
.
He
usually
paid
for
it
by
meeting
immediately
afterwards
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
liberties
with
which
his
fancy
played
after
he
had
turned
*NL*
off
to
the
hillside
that
did
really
and
truly
,
as
well
as
most
amiably
,
*NL*
await
him
beneath
the
poplars
,
the
hillside
that
made
him
feel
,
for
a
*NL*
murmurous
couple
of
hours
,
how
happy
had
been
his
thought
.
He
had
the
*NL*
sense
of
success
,
of
a
finer
harmony
in
things
;
nothing
but
what
had
*NL*
turned
out
as
yet
according
to
his
plan
.
It
most
of
all
came
home
to
*NL*
him
,
as
he
lay
on
his
back
on
the
grass
,
that
Sarah
had
really
gone
,
*NL*
that
his
tension
was
really
relaxed
;
the
peace
diffused
in
these
ideas
*NL*
might
be
delusive
,
but
it
hung
about
him
none
the
less
for
the
time
.
It
*NL*
fairly
,
for
half
an
hour
,
sent
him
to
sleep
;
he
pulled
his
straw
hat
*NL*
over
his
eyes
--
he
had
bought
it
the
day
before
with
a
reminiscence
of
*NL*
Waymarsh
's
--
and
lost
himself
anew
in
Lambinet
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
*NL*
found
out
he
was
tired
--
tired
not
from
his
walk
,
but
from
that
inward
*NL*
exercise
which
had
known
,
on
the
whole
,
for
three
months
,
so
little
*NL*
intermission
.
That
was
it
--
when
once
they
were
off
he
had
dropped
;
*NL*
this
moreover
was
what
he
had
dropped
to
,
and
now
he
was
touching
*NL*
bottom
.
He
was
kept
luxuriously
quiet
,
soothed
and
amused
by
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
what
he
had
found
at
the
end
of
his
descent
.
It
was
*NL*
very
much
what
he
had
told
Maria
Gostrey
he
should
like
to
stay
on
for
,
*NL*
the
hugely-distributed
Paris
of
summer
,
alternately
dazzling
and
dusky
,
*NL*
with
a
weight
lifted
for
him
off
its
columns
and
cornices
and
with
*NL*
shade
and
air
in
the
flutter
of
awnings
as
wide
as
avenues
.
It
was
*NL*
present
to
him
without
attenuation
that
,
reaching
out
,
the
day
after
*NL*
making
the
remark
,
for
some
proof
of
his
freedom
,
he
had
gone
that
very
*NL*
afternoon
to
see
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
He
had
gone
again
the
next
day
but
*NL*
one
,
and
the
effect
of
the
two
visits
,
the
after-sense
of
the
couple
of
*NL*
hours
spent
with
her
,
was
almost
that
of
fulness
and
frequency
.
The
*NL*
brave
intention
of
frequency
,
so
great
with
him
from
the
moment
of
his
*NL*
finding
himself
unjustly
suspected
at
Woollett
,
had
remained
rather
*NL*
theoretic
,
and
one
of
the
things
he
could
muse
about
under
his
poplars
*NL*
was
the
source
of
the
special
shyness
that
had
still
made
him
careful
.
*NL*
He
had
surely
got
rid
of
it
now
,
this
special
shyness
;
what
had
become
*NL*
of
it
if
it
had
n't
precisely
,
within
the
week
,
rubbed
off
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
struck
him
now
in
fact
as
sufficiently
plain
that
if
he
had
still
*NL*
been
careful
he
had
been
so
for
a
reason
.
He
had
really
feared
,
in
his
*NL*
behaviour
,
a
lapse
from
good
faith
;
if
there
was
a
danger
of
one
's
*NL*
liking
such
a
woman
too
much
one
's
best
safety
was
in
waiting
at
least
*NL*
till
one
had
the
right
to
do
so
.
In
the
light
of
the
last
few
days
the
*NL*
danger
was
fairly
vivid
;
so
that
it
was
proportionately
fortunate
that
*NL*
the
right
was
likewise
established
.
It
seemed
to
our
friend
that
he
had
*NL*
on
each
occasion
profited
to
the
utmost
by
the
latter
:
how
could
he
*NL*
have
done
so
more
,
he
at
all
events
asked
himself
,
than
in
having
*NL*
immediately
let
her
know
that
,
if
it
was
all
the
same
to
her
,
he
*NL*
preferred
not
to
talk
about
anything
tiresome
?
He
had
never
in
his
*NL*
life
so
sacrificed
an
armful
of
high
interests
as
in
that
remark
;
he
*NL*
had
never
so
prepared
the
way
for
the
comparatively
frivolous
as
in
*NL*
addressing
it
to
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
intelligence
.
It
had
n't
been
till
*NL*
later
that
he
quite
recalled
how
in
conjuring
away
everything
but
the
*NL*
pleasant
he
had
conjured
away
almost
all
they
had
hitherto
talked
*NL*
about
;
it
was
not
till
later
even
that
he
remembered
how
,
with
their
*NL*
new
tone
,
they
had
n't
so
much
as
mentioned
the
name
of
Chad
himself
.
*NL*
One
of
the
things
that
most
lingered
with
him
on
his
hillside
was
this
*NL*
delightful
facility
,
with
such
a
woman
,
of
arriving
at
a
new
tone
;
he
*NL*
thought
,
as
he
lay
on
his
back
,
of
all
the
tones
she
might
make
*NL*
possible
if
one
were
to
try
her
,
and
at
any
rate
of
the
probability
*NL*
that
one
could
trust
her
to
fit
them
to
occasions
.
He
had
wanted
her
*NL*
to
feel
that
,
as
he
was
disinterested
now
,
so
she
herself
should
be
,
*NL*
and
she
had
showed
she
felt
it
,
and
he
had
showed
he
was
grateful
,
and
*NL*
it
had
been
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
calling
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
They
had
had
other
,
but
irrelevant
,
meetings
;
it
was
quite
as
if
,
had
*NL*
they
sooner
known
how
much
they
REALLY
had
in
common
,
there
were
*NL*
quantities
of
comparatively
dull
matters
they
might
have
skipped
.
Well
,
*NL*
they
were
skipping
them
now
,
even
to
graceful
gratitude
,
even
to
*NL*
handsome
``
Do
n't
mention
it
!
''
--
and
it
was
amazing
what
could
still
come
*NL*
up
without
reference
to
what
had
been
going
on
between
them
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
,
on
analysis
,
nothing
more
than
Shakespeare
and
the
musical
*NL*
glasses
;
but
it
had
served
all
the
purpose
of
his
appearing
to
have
*NL*
said
to
her
:
``
Do
n't
like
me
,
if
it
's
a
question
of
liking
me
,
for
*NL*
anything
obvious
and
clumsy
that
I
've
,
as
they
call
it
,
`
done
'
for
you
:
*NL*
like
me
--
well
,
like
me
,
hang
it
,
for
anything
else
you
choose
.
So
,
by
*NL*
the
same
propriety
,
do
n't
be
for
me
simply
the
person
I
've
come
to
know
*NL*
through
my
awkward
connexion
with
Chad
--
was
ever
anything
,
by
the
way
,
*NL*
MORE
awkward
?
Be
for
me
,
please
,
with
all
your
admirable
tact
and
*NL*
trust
,
just
whatever
I
may
show
you
it
's
a
present
pleasure
to
me
to
*NL*
think
you
.
''
It
had
been
a
large
indication
to
meet
;
but
if
she
had
n't
*NL*
met
it
what
HAD
she
done
,
and
how
had
their
time
together
slipped
along
*NL*
so
smoothly
,
mild
but
not
slow
,
and
melting
,
liquefying
,
into
his
happy
*NL*
illusion
of
idleness
?
He
could
recognise
on
the
other
hand
that
he
had
*NL*
probably
not
been
without
reason
,
in
his
prior
,
his
restricted
state
,
*NL*
for
keeping
an
eye
on
his
liability
to
lapse
from
good
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
continued
in
the
picture
--
that
being
for
himself
his
*NL*
situation
--
all
the
rest
of
this
rambling
day
;
so
that
the
charm
was
*NL*
still
,
was
indeed
more
than
ever
upon
him
when
,
toward
six
o'clock
he
*NL*
found
himself
amicably
engaged
with
a
stout
white-capped
deep-voiced
*NL*
woman
at
the
door
of
the
auberge
of
the
biggest
village
,
a
village
that
*NL*
affected
him
as
a
thing
of
whiteness
,
blueness
and
crookedness
,
set
in
*NL*
coppery
green
,
and
that
had
the
river
flowing
behind
or
before
it
--
one
*NL*
could
n't
say
which
;
at
the
bottom
,
in
particular
,
of
the
inn-garden
.
He
*NL*
had
had
other
adventures
before
this
;
had
kept
along
the
height
,
after
*NL*
shaking
off
slumber
;
had
admired
,
had
almost
coveted
,
another
small
old
*NL*
church
,
all
steep
roof
and
dim
slate-colour
without
and
all
whitewash
*NL*
and
paper
flowers
within
;
had
lost
his
way
and
had
found
it
again
;
had
*NL*
conversed
with
rustics
who
struck
him
perhaps
a
little
more
as
men
of
*NL*
the
world
than
he
had
expected
;
had
acquired
at
a
bound
a
fearless
*NL*
facility
in
French
;
had
had
,
as
the
afternoon
waned
,
a
watery
bock
,
all
*NL*
pale
and
Parisian
,
in
the
cafe
of
the
furthest
village
,
which
was
not
*NL*
the
biggest
;
and
had
meanwhile
not
once
overstepped
the
oblong
gilt
*NL*
frame
.
The
frame
had
drawn
itself
out
for
him
,
as
much
as
you
please
;
*NL*
but
that
was
just
his
luck
.
He
had
finally
come
down
again
to
the
*NL*
valley
,
to
keep
within
touch
of
stations
and
trains
,
turning
his
face
*NL*
to
the
quarter
from
which
he
had
started
;
and
thus
it
was
that
he
had
*NL*
at
last
pulled
up
before
the
hostess
of
the
Cheval
Blanc
,
who
met
him
,
*NL*
with
a
rough
readiness
that
was
like
the
clatter
of
sabots
over
stones
,
*NL*
on
their
common
ground
of
a
cotelette
de
veau
a
l'oseille
and
a
*NL*
subsequent
lift
.
He
had
walked
many
miles
and
did
n't
know
he
was
*NL*
tired
;
but
he
still
knew
he
was
amused
,
and
even
that
,
though
he
had
*NL*
been
alone
all
day
,
he
had
never
yet
so
struck
himself
as
engaged
with
*NL*
others
and
in
midstream
of
his
drama
.
It
might
have
passed
for
*NL*
finished
his
drama
,
with
its
catastrophe
all
but
reached
:
it
had
,
*NL*
however
,
none
the
less
been
vivid
again
for
him
as
he
thus
gave
it
its
*NL*
fuller
chance
.
He
had
only
had
to
be
at
last
well
out
of
it
to
feel
*NL*
it
,
oddly
enough
,
still
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
had
been
all
day
at
bottom
the
spell
of
the
picture
--
that
it
*NL*
was
essentially
more
than
anything
else
a
scene
and
a
stage
,
that
the
*NL*
very
air
of
the
play
was
in
the
rustle
of
the
willows
and
the
tone
of
*NL*
the
sky
.
The
play
and
the
characters
had
,
without
his
knowing
it
till
*NL*
now
,
peopled
all
his
space
for
him
,
and
it
seemed
somehow
quite
happy
*NL*
that
they
should
offer
themselves
,
in
the
conditions
so
supplied
,
with
*NL*
a
kind
of
inevitability
.
It
was
as
if
the
conditions
made
them
not
*NL*
only
inevitable
,
but
so
much
more
nearly
natural
and
right
as
that
they
*NL*
were
at
least
easier
,
pleasanter
,
to
put
up
with
.
The
conditions
had
*NL*
nowhere
so
asserted
their
difference
from
those
of
Woollett
as
they
*NL*
appeared
to
him
to
assert
it
in
the
little
court
of
the
Cheval
Blanc
*NL*
while
he
arranged
with
his
hostess
for
a
comfortable
climax
.
They
were
*NL*
few
and
simple
,
scant
and
humble
,
but
they
were
THE
THING
,
as
he
would
*NL*
have
called
it
,
even
to
a
greater
degree
than
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
old
*NL*
high
salon
where
the
ghost
of
the
Empire
walked
.
``
The
''
thing
was
the
*NL*
thing
that
implied
the
greatest
number
of
other
things
of
the
sort
he
*NL*
had
had
to
tackle
;
and
it
was
queer
of
course
,
but
so
it
was
--
the
*NL*
implication
here
was
complete
.
Not
a
single
one
of
his
observations
*NL*
but
somehow
fell
into
a
place
in
it
;
not
a
breath
of
the
cooler
evening
*NL*
that
was
n't
somehow
a
syllable
of
the
text
.
The
text
was
simply
,
when
*NL*
condensed
,
that
in
THESE
places
such
things
were
,
and
that
if
it
was
in
*NL*
them
one
elected
to
move
about
one
had
to
make
one
's
account
with
what
*NL*
one
lighted
on
.
Meanwhile
at
all
events
it
was
enough
that
they
did
*NL*
affect
one
--
so
far
as
the
village
aspect
was
concerned
--
as
whiteness
,
*NL*
crookedness
and
blueness
set
in
coppery
green
;
there
being
positively
,
*NL*
for
that
matter
,
an
outer
wall
of
the
White
Horse
that
was
painted
the
*NL*
most
improbable
shade
.
That
was
part
of
the
amusement
--
as
if
to
show
*NL*
that
the
fun
was
harmless
;
just
as
it
was
enough
,
further
,
that
the
*NL*
picture
and
the
play
seemed
supremely
to
melt
together
in
the
good
*NL*
woman
's
broad
sketch
of
what
she
could
do
for
her
visitor
's
appetite
.
*NL*
He
felt
in
short
a
confidence
,
and
it
was
general
,
and
it
was
all
he
*NL*
wanted
to
feel
.
It
suffered
no
shock
even
on
her
mentioning
that
she
*NL*
had
in
fact
just
laid
the
cloth
for
two
persons
who
,
unlike
Monsieur
,
*NL*
had
arrived
by
the
river
--
in
a
boat
of
their
own
;
who
had
asked
her
,
*NL*
half
an
hour
before
,
what
she
could
do
for
them
,
and
had
then
paddled
*NL*
away
to
look
at
something
a
little
further
up
--
from
which
promenade
*NL*
they
would
presently
return
.
Monsieur
might
meanwhile
,
if
he
liked
,
*NL*
pass
into
the
garden
,
such
as
it
was
,
where
she
would
serve
him
,
should
*NL*
he
wish
it
--
for
there
were
tables
and
benches
in
plenty
--
a
``
bitter
''
*NL*
before
his
repast
.
Here
she
would
also
report
to
him
on
the
possibility
*NL*
of
a
conveyance
to
his
station
,
and
here
at
any
rate
he
would
have
the
*NL*
agrement
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
mentioned
without
delay
that
Monsieur
had
the
agrement
of
*NL*
everything
,
and
in
particular
,
for
the
next
twenty
minutes
,
of
a
small
*NL*
and
primitive
pavilion
that
,
at
the
garden
's
edge
,
almost
overhung
the
*NL*
water
,
testifying
,
in
its
somewhat
battered
state
,
to
much
fond
*NL*
frequentation
.
It
consisted
of
little
more
than
a
platform
,
slightly
*NL*
raised
,
with
a
couple
of
benches
and
a
table
,
a
protecting
rail
and
a
*NL*
projecting
roof
;
but
it
raked
the
full
grey-blue
stream
,
which
,
taking
*NL*
a
turn
a
short
distance
above
,
passed
out
of
sight
to
reappear
much
*NL*
higher
up
;
and
it
was
clearly
in
esteemed
requisition
for
Sundays
and
*NL*
other
feasts
.
Strether
sat
there
and
,
though
hungry
,
felt
at
peace
;
*NL*
the
confidence
that
had
so
gathered
for
him
deepened
with
the
lap
of
*NL*
the
water
,
the
ripple
of
the
surface
,
the
rustle
of
the
reeds
on
the
*NL*
opposite
bank
,
the
faint
diffused
coolness
and
the
slight
rock
of
a
*NL*
couple
of
small
boats
attached
to
a
rough
landing-place
hard
by
.
The
*NL*
valley
on
the
further
side
was
all
copper-green
level
and
glazed
pearly
*NL*
sky
,
a
sky
hatched
across
with
screens
of
trimmed
trees
,
which
looked
*NL*
flat
,
like
espaliers
;
and
though
the
rest
of
the
village
straggled
away
*NL*
in
the
near
quarter
the
view
had
an
emptiness
that
made
one
of
the
*NL*
boats
suggestive
.
Such
a
river
set
one
afloat
almost
before
one
could
*NL*
take
up
the
oars
--
the
idle
play
of
which
would
be
moreover
the
aid
to
*NL*
the
full
impression
.
This
perception
went
so
far
as
to
bring
him
to
*NL*
his
feet
;
but
that
movement
,
in
turn
,
made
him
feel
afresh
that
he
was
*NL*
tired
,
and
while
he
leaned
against
a
post
and
continued
to
look
out
he
*NL*
saw
something
that
gave
him
a
sharper
arrest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
saw
was
exactly
the
right
thing
--
a
boat
advancing
round
the
*NL*
bend
and
containing
a
man
who
held
the
paddles
and
a
lady
,
at
the
*NL*
stern
,
with
a
pink
parasol
.
It
was
suddenly
as
if
these
figures
,
or
*NL*
something
like
them
,
had
been
wanted
in
the
picture
,
had
been
wanted
*NL*
more
or
less
all
day
,
and
had
now
drifted
into
sight
,
with
the
slow
*NL*
current
,
on
purpose
to
fill
up
the
measure
.
They
came
slowly
,
floating
*NL*
down
,
evidently
directed
to
the
landing-place
near
their
spectator
and
*NL*
presenting
themselves
to
him
not
less
clearly
as
the
two
persons
for
*NL*
whom
his
hostess
was
already
preparing
a
meal
.
For
two
very
happy
*NL*
persons
he
found
himself
straightway
taking
them
--
a
young
man
in
*NL*
shirt-sleeves
,
a
young
woman
easy
and
fair
,
who
had
pulled
pleasantly
*NL*
up
from
some
other
place
and
,
being
acquainted
with
the
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
had
known
what
this
particular
retreat
could
offer
them
.
The
air
quite
*NL*
thickened
,
at
their
approach
,
with
further
intimations
;
the
intimation
*NL*
that
they
were
expert
,
familiar
,
frequent
--
that
this
would
n't
at
all
*NL*
events
be
the
first
time
.
They
knew
how
to
do
it
,
he
vaguely
felt
--
and
*NL*
it
made
them
but
the
more
idyllic
,
though
at
the
very
moment
of
the
*NL*
impression
,
as
happened
,
their
boat
seemed
to
have
begun
to
drift
wide
,
*NL*
the
oarsman
letting
it
go
.
It
had
by
this
time
none
the
less
come
*NL*
much
nearer
--
near
enough
for
Strether
to
dream
the
lady
in
the
stern
*NL*
had
for
some
reason
taken
account
of
his
being
there
to
watch
them
.
She
*NL*
had
remarked
on
it
sharply
,
yet
her
companion
had
n't
turned
round
;
it
*NL*
was
in
fact
almost
as
if
our
friend
had
felt
her
bid
him
keep
still
.
*NL*
She
had
taken
in
something
as
a
result
of
which
their
course
had
*NL*
wavered
,
and
it
continued
to
waver
while
they
just
stood
off
.
This
*NL*
little
effect
was
sudden
and
rapid
,
so
rapid
that
Strether
's
sense
of
*NL*
it
was
separate
only
for
an
instant
from
a
sharp
start
of
his
own
.
He
*NL*
too
had
within
the
minute
taken
in
something
,
taken
in
that
he
knew
the
*NL*
lady
whose
parasol
,
shifting
as
if
to
hide
her
face
,
made
so
fine
a
*NL*
pink
point
in
the
shining
scene
.
It
was
too
prodigious
,
a
chance
in
a
*NL*
million
,
but
,
if
he
knew
the
lady
,
the
gentleman
,
who
still
presented
*NL*
his
back
and
kept
off
,
the
gentleman
,
the
coatless
hero
of
the
idyll
,
*NL*
who
had
responded
to
her
start
,
was
,
to
match
the
marvel
,
none
other
*NL*
than
Chad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
and
Madame
de
Vionnet
were
then
like
himself
taking
a
day
in
the
*NL*
country
--
though
it
was
as
queer
as
fiction
,
as
farce
,
that
their
*NL*
country
could
happen
to
be
exactly
his
;
and
she
had
been
the
first
at
*NL*
recognition
,
the
first
to
feel
,
across
the
water
,
the
shock
--
for
it
*NL*
appeared
to
come
to
that
--
of
their
wonderful
accident
.
Strether
became
*NL*
aware
,
with
this
,
of
what
was
taking
place
--
that
her
recognition
had
*NL*
been
even
stranger
for
the
pair
in
the
boat
,
that
her
immediate
impulse
*NL*
had
been
to
control
it
,
and
that
she
was
quickly
and
intensely
debating
*NL*
with
Chad
the
risk
of
betrayal
.
He
saw
they
would
show
nothing
if
they
*NL*
could
feel
sure
he
had
n't
made
them
out
;
so
that
he
had
before
him
for
*NL*
a
few
seconds
his
own
hesitation
.
It
was
a
sharp
fantastic
crisis
that
*NL*
had
popped
up
as
if
in
a
dream
,
and
it
had
had
only
to
last
the
few
*NL*
seconds
to
make
him
feel
it
as
quite
horrible
.
They
were
thus
,
on
*NL*
either
side
,
TRYING
the
other
side
,
and
all
for
some
reason
that
broke
*NL*
the
stillness
like
some
unprovoked
harsh
note
.
It
seemed
to
him
again
,
*NL*
within
the
limit
,
that
he
had
but
one
thing
to
do
--
to
settle
their
*NL*
common
question
by
some
sign
of
surprise
and
joy
.
He
hereupon
gave
*NL*
large
play
to
these
things
,
agitating
his
hat
and
his
stick
and
loudly
*NL*
calling
out
--
a
demonstration
that
brought
him
relief
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
seen
it
answered
.
The
boat
,
in
mid-stream
,
still
went
a
little
*NL*
wild
--
which
seemed
natural
,
however
,
while
Chad
turned
round
,
half
*NL*
springing
up
;
and
his
good
friend
,
after
blankness
and
wonder
,
began
*NL*
gaily
to
wave
her
parasol
.
Chad
dropped
afresh
to
his
paddles
and
the
*NL*
boat
headed
round
,
amazement
and
pleasantry
filling
the
air
meanwhile
,
*NL*
and
relief
,
as
Strether
continued
to
fancy
,
superseding
mere
violence
.
*NL*
Our
friend
went
down
to
the
water
under
this
odd
impression
as
of
*NL*
violence
averted
--
the
violence
of
their
having
``
cut
''
him
,
out
there
in
*NL*
the
eye
of
nature
,
on
the
assumption
that
he
would
n't
know
it
.
He
*NL*
awaited
them
with
a
face
from
which
he
was
conscious
of
not
being
able
*NL*
quite
to
banish
this
idea
that
they
would
have
gone
on
,
not
seeing
and
*NL*
not
knowing
,
missing
their
dinner
and
disappointing
their
hostess
,
had
*NL*
he
himself
taken
a
line
to
match
.
That
at
least
was
what
darkened
his
*NL*
vision
for
the
moment
.
Afterwards
,
after
they
had
bumped
at
the
*NL*
landing-place
and
he
had
assisted
their
getting
ashore
,
everything
*NL*
found
itself
sponged
over
by
the
mere
miracle
of
the
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
so
much
better
at
last
,
on
either
side
,
treat
it
as
a
wild
*NL*
extravagance
of
hazard
,
that
the
situation
was
made
elastic
by
the
*NL*
amount
of
explanation
called
into
play
.
Why
indeed
--
apart
from
*NL*
oddity
--
the
situation
should
have
been
really
stiff
was
a
question
*NL*
naturally
not
practical
at
the
moment
,
and
in
fact
,
so
far
as
we
are
*NL*
concerned
,
a
question
tackled
,
later
on
and
in
private
,
only
by
*NL*
Strether
himself
.
He
was
to
reflect
later
on
and
in
private
that
it
*NL*
was
mainly
HE
who
had
explained
--
as
he
had
had
moreover
comparatively
*NL*
little
difficulty
in
doing
.
He
was
to
have
at
all
events
meanwhile
the
*NL*
worrying
thought
of
their
perhaps
secretly
suspecting
him
of
having
*NL*
plotted
this
coincidence
,
taking
such
pains
as
might
be
to
give
it
the
*NL*
semblance
of
an
accident
.
That
possibility
--
as
their
*NL*
imputation
--
did
n't
of
course
bear
looking
into
for
an
instant
;
yet
the
*NL*
whole
incident
was
so
manifestly
,
arrange
it
as
they
would
,
an
awkward
*NL*
one
,
that
he
could
scarce
keep
disclaimers
in
respect
to
his
own
*NL*
presence
from
rising
to
his
lips
.
Disclaimers
of
intention
would
have
*NL*
been
as
tactless
as
his
presence
was
practically
gross
;
and
the
*NL*
narrowest
escape
they
either
of
them
had
was
his
lucky
escape
,
in
the
*NL*
event
,
from
making
any
.
Nothing
of
the
sort
,
so
far
as
surface
and
*NL*
sound
were
involved
,
was
even
in
question
;
surface
and
sound
all
made
*NL*
for
their
common
ridiculous
good
fortune
,
for
the
general
*NL*
invraisemblance
of
the
occasion
,
for
the
charming
chance
that
they
had
,
*NL*
the
others
,
in
passing
,
ordered
some
food
to
be
ready
,
the
charming
*NL*
chance
that
he
had
himself
not
eaten
,
the
charming
chance
,
even
more
,
*NL*
that
their
little
plans
,
their
hours
,
their
train
,
in
short
,
from
*NL*
la-bas
,
would
all
match
for
their
return
together
to
Paris
.
The
chance
*NL*
that
was
most
charming
of
all
,
the
chance
that
drew
from
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
her
clearest
,
gayest
``
Comme
cela
se
trouve
!
''
was
the
*NL*
announcement
made
to
Strether
after
they
were
seated
at
table
,
the
word
*NL*
given
him
by
their
hostess
in
respect
to
his
carriage
for
the
station
,
*NL*
on
which
he
might
now
count
.
It
settled
the
matter
for
his
friends
as
*NL*
well
;
the
conveyance
--
it
WAS
all
too
lucky
!
--
would
serve
for
them
;
and
*NL*
nothing
was
more
delightful
than
his
being
in
a
position
to
make
the
*NL*
train
so
definite
.
It
might
have
been
,
for
themselves
--
to
hear
Madame
*NL*
de
Vionnet
--
almost
unnaturally
vague
,
a
detail
left
to
be
fixed
;
though
*NL*
Strether
indeed
was
afterwards
to
remember
that
Chad
had
promptly
*NL*
enough
intervened
to
forestall
this
appearance
,
laughing
at
his
*NL*
companion
's
flightiness
and
making
the
point
that
he
had
after
all
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
bedazzlement
of
a
day
out
with
her
,
known
what
he
was
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
was
to
remember
afterwards
further
that
this
had
had
for
him
*NL*
the
effect
of
forming
Chad
's
almost
sole
intervention
;
and
indeed
he
*NL*
was
to
remember
further
still
,
in
subsequent
meditation
,
many
things
*NL*
that
,
as
it
were
,
fitted
together
.
Another
of
them
was
for
instance
*NL*
that
the
wonderful
woman
's
overflow
of
surprise
and
amusement
was
*NL*
wholly
into
French
,
which
she
struck
him
as
speaking
with
an
*NL*
unprecedented
command
of
idiomatic
turns
,
but
in
which
she
got
,
as
he
*NL*
might
have
said
,
somewhat
away
from
him
,
taking
all
at
once
little
*NL*
brilliant
jumps
that
he
could
but
lamely
match
.
The
question
of
his
*NL*
own
French
had
never
come
up
for
them
;
it
was
the
one
thing
she
*NL*
would
n't
have
permitted
--
it
belonged
,
for
a
person
who
had
been
through
*NL*
much
,
to
mere
boredom
;
but
the
present
result
was
odd
,
fairly
veiling
*NL*
her
identity
,
shifting
her
back
into
a
mere
voluble
class
or
race
to
*NL*
the
intense
audibility
of
which
he
was
by
this
time
inured
.
When
she
*NL*
spoke
the
charming
slightly
strange
English
he
best
knew
her
by
he
*NL*
seemed
to
feel
her
as
a
creature
,
among
all
the
millions
,
with
a
*NL*
language
quite
to
herself
,
the
real
monopoly
of
a
special
shade
of
*NL*
speech
,
beautifully
easy
for
her
,
yet
of
a
colour
and
a
cadence
that
*NL*
were
both
inimitable
and
matters
of
accident
.
She
came
back
to
these
*NL*
things
after
they
had
shaken
down
in
the
inn-parlour
and
knew
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
what
was
to
become
of
them
;
it
was
inevitable
that
loud
*NL*
ejaculation
over
the
prodigy
of
their
convergence
should
at
last
wear
*NL*
itself
out
.
Then
it
was
that
his
impression
took
fuller
form
--
the
*NL*
impression
,
destined
only
to
deepen
,
to
complete
itself
,
that
they
had
*NL*
something
to
put
a
face
upon
,
to
carry
off
and
make
the
best
of
,
and
*NL*
that
it
was
she
who
,
admirably
on
the
whole
,
was
doing
this
.
It
was
*NL*
familiar
to
him
of
course
that
they
had
something
to
put
a
face
upon
;
*NL*
their
friendship
,
their
connexion
,
took
any
amount
of
explaining
--
that
*NL*
would
have
been
made
familiar
by
his
twenty
minutes
with
Mrs.
Pocock
if
*NL*
it
had
n't
already
been
so
.
Yet
his
theory
,
as
we
know
,
had
bountifully
*NL*
been
that
the
facts
were
specifically
none
of
his
business
,
and
were
,
*NL*
over
and
above
,
so
far
as
one
had
to
do
with
them
,
intrinsically
*NL*
beautiful
;
and
this
might
have
prepared
him
for
anything
,
as
well
as
*NL*
rendered
him
proof
against
mystification
.
When
he
reached
home
that
*NL*
night
,
however
,
he
knew
he
had
been
,
at
bottom
,
neither
prepared
nor
*NL*
proof
;
and
since
we
have
spoken
of
what
he
was
,
after
his
return
,
to
*NL*
recall
and
interpret
,
it
may
as
well
immediately
be
said
that
his
real
*NL*
experience
of
these
few
hours
put
on
,
in
that
belated
vision
--
for
he
*NL*
scarce
went
to
bed
till
morning
--
the
aspect
that
is
most
to
our
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
knew
more
or
less
how
he
had
been
affected
--
he
but
half
knew
at
*NL*
the
time
.
There
had
been
plenty
to
affect
him
even
after
,
as
has
been
*NL*
said
,
they
had
shaken
down
;
for
his
consciousness
,
though
muffled
,
had
*NL*
its
sharpest
moments
during
this
passage
,
a
marked
drop
into
innocent
*NL*
friendly
Bohemia
.
They
then
had
put
their
elbows
on
the
table
,
*NL*
deploring
the
premature
end
of
their
two
or
three
dishes
;
which
they
*NL*
had
tried
to
make
up
with
another
bottle
while
Chad
joked
a
little
*NL*
spasmodically
,
perhaps
even
a
little
irrelevantly
,
with
the
hostess
.
*NL*
What
it
all
came
to
had
been
that
fiction
and
fable
WERE
,
inevitably
,
*NL*
in
the
air
,
and
not
as
a
simple
term
of
comparison
,
but
as
a
result
of
*NL*
things
said
;
also
that
they
were
blinking
it
,
all
round
,
and
that
they
*NL*
yet
need
n't
,
so
much
as
that
,
have
blinked
it
--
though
indeed
if
they
*NL*
had
n't
Strether
did
n't
quite
see
what
else
they
could
have
done
.
*NL*
Strether
did
n't
quite
see
THAT
even
at
an
hour
or
two
past
midnight
,
*NL*
even
when
he
had
,
at
his
hotel
,
for
a
long
time
,
without
a
light
and
*NL*
without
undressing
,
sat
back
on
his
bedroom
sofa
and
stared
straight
*NL*
before
him
.
He
was
,
at
that
point
of
vantage
,
in
full
possession
,
to
*NL*
make
of
it
all
what
he
could
.
He
kept
making
of
it
that
there
had
been
*NL*
simply
a
LIE
in
the
charming
affair
--
a
lie
on
which
one
could
now
,
*NL*
detached
and
deliberate
,
perfectly
put
one
's
finger
.
It
was
with
the
*NL*
lie
that
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
and
talked
and
laughed
,
that
they
had
*NL*
waited
for
their
carriole
rather
impatiently
,
and
had
then
got
into
the
*NL*
vehicle
and
,
sensibly
subsiding
,
driven
their
three
or
four
miles
*NL*
through
the
darkening
summer
night
.
The
eating
and
drinking
,
which
had
*NL*
been
a
resource
,
had
had
the
effect
of
having
served
its
turn
;
the
talk
*NL*
and
laughter
had
done
as
much
;
and
it
was
during
their
somewhat
tedious
*NL*
progress
to
the
station
,
during
the
waits
there
,
the
further
delays
,
*NL*
their
submission
to
fatigue
,
their
silences
in
the
dim
compartment
of
*NL*
the
much-stopping
train
,
that
he
prepared
himself
for
reflexions
to
*NL*
come
.
It
had
been
a
performance
,
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
manner
,
and
though
*NL*
it
had
to
that
degree
faltered
toward
the
end
,
as
through
her
ceasing
*NL*
to
believe
in
it
,
as
if
she
had
asked
herself
,
or
Chad
had
found
a
*NL*
moment
surreptitiously
to
ask
her
,
what
after
all
was
the
use
,
a
*NL*
performance
it
had
none
the
less
quite
handsomely
remained
,
with
the
*NL*
final
fact
about
it
that
it
was
on
the
whole
easier
to
keep
up
than
to
*NL*
abandon
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
point
of
view
of
presence
of
mind
it
had
been
very
wonderful
*NL*
indeed
,
wonderful
for
readiness
,
for
beautiful
assurance
,
for
the
way
*NL*
her
decision
was
taken
on
the
spot
,
without
time
to
confer
with
Chad
,
*NL*
without
time
for
anything
.
Their
only
conference
could
have
been
the
*NL*
brief
instants
in
the
boat
before
they
confessed
to
recognising
the
*NL*
spectator
on
the
bank
,
for
they
had
n't
been
alone
together
a
moment
*NL*
since
and
must
have
communicated
all
in
silence
.
It
was
a
part
of
the
*NL*
deep
impression
for
Strether
,
and
not
the
least
of
the
deep
interest
,
*NL*
that
they
COULD
so
communicate
--
that
Chad
in
particular
could
let
her
*NL*
know
he
left
it
to
her
.
He
habitually
left
things
to
others
,
as
*NL*
Strether
was
so
well
aware
,
and
it
in
fact
came
over
our
friend
in
*NL*
these
meditations
that
there
had
been
as
yet
no
such
vivid
illustration
*NL*
of
his
famous
knowing
how
to
live
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
humoured
her
to
*NL*
the
extent
of
letting
her
lie
without
correction
--
almost
as
if
,
really
,
*NL*
he
would
be
coming
round
in
the
morning
to
set
the
matter
,
as
between
*NL*
Strether
and
himself
,
right
.
Of
course
he
could
n't
quite
come
;
it
was
*NL*
a
case
in
which
a
man
was
obliged
to
accept
the
woman
's
version
,
even
*NL*
when
fantastic
;
if
she
had
,
with
more
flurry
than
she
cared
to
show
,
*NL*
elected
,
as
the
phrase
was
,
to
represent
that
they
had
left
Paris
that
*NL*
morning
,
and
with
no
design
but
of
getting
back
within
the
day
--
if
she
*NL*
had
so
sized-up
,
in
the
Woollett
phrase
,
their
necessity
,
she
knew
best
*NL*
her
own
measure
.
There
were
things
,
all
the
same
,
it
was
impossible
to
*NL*
blink
and
which
made
this
measure
an
odd
one
--
the
too
evident
fact
for
*NL*
instance
that
she
had
n't
started
out
for
the
day
dressed
and
hatted
and
*NL*
shod
,
and
even
,
for
that
matter
,
pink
parasol
'd
,
as
she
had
been
in
the
*NL*
boat
.
From
what
did
the
drop
in
her
assurance
proceed
as
the
tension
*NL*
increased
--
from
what
did
this
slightly
baffled
ingenuity
spring
but
*NL*
from
her
consciousness
of
not
presenting
,
as
night
closed
in
,
with
not
*NL*
so
much
as
a
shawl
to
wrap
her
round
,
an
appearance
that
matched
her
*NL*
story
?
She
admitted
that
she
was
cold
,
but
only
to
blame
her
*NL*
imprudence
which
Chad
suffered
her
to
give
such
account
of
as
she
*NL*
might
.
Her
shawl
and
Chad
's
overcoat
and
her
other
garments
,
and
his
,
*NL*
those
they
had
each
worn
the
day
before
,
were
at
the
place
,
best
known
*NL*
to
themselves
--
a
quiet
retreat
enough
,
no
doubt
--
at
which
they
had
been
*NL*
spending
the
twenty-four
hours
,
to
which
they
had
fully
meant
to
return
*NL*
that
evening
,
from
which
they
had
so
remarkably
swum
into
Strether
's
*NL*
ken
,
and
the
tacit
repudiation
of
which
had
been
thus
the
essence
of
*NL*
her
comedy
.
Strether
saw
how
she
had
perceived
in
a
flash
that
they
*NL*
could
n't
quite
look
to
going
back
there
under
his
nose
;
though
,
*NL*
honestly
,
as
he
gouged
deeper
into
the
matter
,
he
was
somewhat
*NL*
surprised
,
as
Chad
likewise
had
perhaps
been
,
at
the
uprising
of
this
*NL*
scruple
.
He
seemed
even
to
divine
that
she
had
entertained
it
rather
*NL*
for
Chad
than
for
herself
,
and
that
,
as
the
young
man
had
lacked
the
*NL*
chance
to
enlighten
her
,
she
had
had
to
go
on
with
it
,
he
meanwhile
*NL*
mistaking
her
motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rather
glad
,
none
the
less
,
that
they
had
in
point
of
fact
not
*NL*
parted
at
the
Cheval
Blanc
,
that
he
had
n't
been
reduced
to
giving
them
*NL*
his
blessing
for
an
idyllic
retreat
down
the
river
.
He
had
had
in
the
*NL*
actual
case
to
make-believe
more
than
he
liked
,
but
this
was
nothing
,
*NL*
it
struck
him
,
to
what
the
other
event
would
have
required
.
Could
he
,
*NL*
literally
,
quite
have
faced
the
other
event
?
Would
he
have
been
*NL*
capable
of
making
the
best
of
it
with
them
?
This
was
what
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
do
now
;
but
with
the
advantage
of
his
being
able
to
give
more
*NL*
time
to
it
a
good
deal
counteracted
by
his
sense
of
what
,
over
and
*NL*
above
the
central
fact
itself
,
he
had
to
swallow
.
It
was
the
quantity
*NL*
of
make-believe
involved
and
so
vividly
exemplified
that
most
disagreed
*NL*
with
his
spiritual
stomach
.
He
moved
,
however
,
from
the
consideration
*NL*
of
that
quantity
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
consciousness
of
that
*NL*
organ
--
back
to
the
other
feature
of
the
show
,
the
deep
,
deep
truth
of
*NL*
the
intimacy
revealed
.
That
was
what
,
in
his
vain
vigil
,
he
oftenest
*NL*
reverted
to
:
intimacy
,
at
such
a
point
,
was
LIKE
that
--
and
what
in
the
*NL*
world
else
would
one
have
wished
it
to
be
like
?
It
was
all
very
well
*NL*
for
him
to
feel
the
pity
of
its
being
so
much
like
lying
;
he
almost
*NL*
blushed
,
in
the
dark
,
for
the
way
he
had
dressed
the
possibility
in
*NL*
vagueness
,
as
a
little
girl
might
have
dressed
her
doll
.
He
had
made
*NL*
them
--
and
by
no
fault
of
their
own
--
momentarily
pull
it
for
him
,
the
*NL*
possibility
,
out
of
this
vagueness
;
and
must
he
not
therefore
take
it
*NL*
now
as
they
had
had
simply
,
with
whatever
thin
attenuations
,
to
give
it
*NL*
to
him
?
The
very
question
,
it
may
be
added
,
made
him
feel
lonely
and
*NL*
cold
.
There
was
the
element
of
the
awkward
all
round
,
but
Chad
and
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
at
least
the
comfort
that
they
could
talk
it
over
*NL*
together
.
With
whom
could
HE
talk
of
such
things
?
--
unless
indeed
*NL*
always
,
at
almost
any
stage
,
with
Maria
?
He
foresaw
that
Miss
Gostrey
*NL*
would
come
again
into
requisition
on
the
morrow
;
though
it
was
n't
to
be
*NL*
denied
that
he
was
already
a
little
afraid
of
her
``
What
on
*NL*
earth
--
that
's
what
I
want
to
know
now
--
had
you
then
supposed
?
''
He
*NL*
recognised
at
last
that
he
had
really
been
trying
all
along
to
suppose
*NL*
nothing
.
Verily
,
verily
,
his
labour
had
been
lost
.
He
found
himself
*NL*
supposing
innumerable
and
wonderful
things
.

*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
could
n't
have
said
he
had
during
the
previous
hours
definitely
*NL*
expected
it
;
yet
when
,
later
on
,
that
morning
--
though
no
later
indeed
*NL*
than
for
his
coming
forth
at
ten
o'clock
--
he
saw
the
concierge
produce
,
*NL*
on
his
approach
,
a
petit
bleu
delivered
since
his
letters
had
been
sent
*NL*
up
,
he
recognised
the
appearance
as
the
first
symptom
of
a
sequel
.
He
*NL*
then
knew
he
had
been
thinking
of
some
early
sign
from
Chad
as
more
*NL*
likely
,
after
all
,
than
not
;
and
this
would
be
precisely
the
early
*NL*
sign
.
He
took
it
so
for
granted
that
he
opened
the
petit
bleu
just
*NL*
where
he
had
stopped
,
in
the
pleasant
cool
draught
of
the
*NL*
porte-cochere
--
only
curious
to
see
where
the
young
man
would
,
at
such
a
*NL*
juncture
,
break
out
.
His
curiosity
,
however
,
was
more
than
gratified
;
*NL*
the
small
missive
,
whose
gummed
edge
he
had
detached
without
attention
*NL*
to
the
address
,
not
being
from
the
young
man
at
all
,
but
from
the
*NL*
person
whom
the
case
gave
him
on
the
spot
as
still
more
worth
while
.
*NL*
Worth
while
or
not
,
he
went
round
to
the
nearest
telegraph-office
,
the
*NL*
big
one
on
the
Boulevard
,
with
a
directness
that
almost
confessed
to
a
*NL*
fear
of
the
danger
of
delay
.
He
might
have
been
thinking
that
if
he
*NL*
did
n't
go
before
he
could
think
he
would
n't
perhaps
go
at
all
.
He
at
*NL*
any
rate
kept
,
in
the
lower
side-pocket
of
his
morning
coat
,
a
very
*NL*
deliberate
hand
on
his
blue
missive
,
crumpling
it
up
rather
tenderly
*NL*
than
harshly
.
He
wrote
a
reply
,
on
the
Boulevard
,
also
in
the
form
of
*NL*
a
petit
bleu
--
which
was
quickly
done
,
under
pressure
of
the
place
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
,
like
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
own
communication
,
it
consisted
*NL*
of
the
fewest
words
.
She
had
asked
him
if
he
could
do
her
the
very
*NL*
great
kindness
of
coming
to
see
her
that
evening
at
half-past
nine
,
and
*NL*
he
answered
,
as
if
nothing
were
easier
,
that
he
would
present
himself
*NL*
at
the
hour
she
named
.
She
had
added
a
line
of
postscript
,
to
the
*NL*
effect
that
she
would
come
to
him
elsewhere
and
at
his
own
hour
if
he
*NL*
preferred
;
but
he
took
no
notice
of
this
,
feeling
that
if
he
saw
her
at
*NL*
all
half
the
value
of
it
would
be
in
seeing
her
where
he
had
already
*NL*
seen
her
best
.
He
might
n't
see
her
at
all
;
that
was
one
of
the
*NL*
reflexions
he
made
after
writing
and
before
he
dropped
his
closed
card
*NL*
into
the
box
;
he
might
n't
see
any
one
at
all
any
more
at
all
;
he
might
*NL*
make
an
end
as
well
now
as
ever
,
leaving
things
as
they
were
,
since
he
*NL*
was
doubtless
not
to
leave
them
better
,
and
taking
his
way
home
so
far
*NL*
as
should
appear
that
a
home
remained
to
him
.
This
alternative
was
for
*NL*
a
few
minutes
so
sharp
that
if
he
at
last
did
deposit
his
missive
it
*NL*
was
perhaps
because
the
pressure
of
the
place
had
an
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
none
other
,
however
,
than
the
common
and
constant
pressure
,
*NL*
familiar
to
our
friend
under
the
rubric
of
Postes
et
Telegraphes
--
the
*NL*
something
in
the
air
of
these
establishments
;
the
vibration
of
the
vast
*NL*
strange
life
of
the
town
,
the
influence
of
the
types
,
the
performers
*NL*
concocting
their
messages
;
the
little
prompt
Paris
women
,
arranging
,
*NL*
pretexting
goodness
knew
what
,
driving
the
dreadful
needle-pointed
*NL*
public
pen
at
the
dreadful
sand-strewn
public
table
:
implements
that
*NL*
symbolised
for
Strether
's
too
interpretative
innocence
something
more
*NL*
acute
in
manners
,
more
sinister
in
morals
,
more
fierce
in
the
national
*NL*
life
.
After
he
had
put
in
his
paper
he
had
ranged
himself
,
he
was
*NL*
really
amused
to
think
,
on
the
side
of
the
fierce
,
the
sinister
,
the
*NL*
acute
.
He
was
carrying
on
a
correspondence
,
across
the
great
city
,
*NL*
quite
in
the
key
of
the
Postes
et
Telegraphes
in
general
;
and
it
was
*NL*
fairly
as
if
the
acceptance
of
that
fact
had
come
from
something
in
his
*NL*
state
that
sorted
with
the
occupation
of
his
neighbours
.
He
was
mixed
*NL*
up
with
the
typical
tale
of
Paris
,
and
so
were
they
,
poor
things
--
how
*NL*
could
they
all
together
help
being
?
They
were
no
worse
than
he
,
in
*NL*
short
,
and
he
no
worse
than
they
--
if
,
queerly
enough
,
no
better
;
and
at
*NL*
all
events
he
had
settled
his
hash
,
so
that
he
went
out
to
begin
,
from
*NL*
that
moment
,
his
day
of
waiting
.
The
great
settlement
was
,
as
he
felt
,
*NL*
in
his
preference
for
seeing
his
correspondent
in
her
own
best
*NL*
conditions
.
THAT
was
part
of
the
typical
tale
,
the
part
most
*NL*
significant
in
respect
to
himself
.
He
liked
the
place
she
lived
in
,
*NL*
the
picture
that
each
time
squared
itself
,
large
and
high
and
clear
,
*NL*
around
her
:
every
occasion
of
seeing
it
was
a
pleasure
of
a
different
*NL*
shade
.
Yet
what
precisely
was
he
doing
with
shades
of
pleasure
now
,
*NL*
and
why
had
n't
he
properly
and
logically
compelled
her
to
commit
*NL*
herself
to
whatever
of
disadvantage
and
penalty
the
situation
might
*NL*
throw
up
?
He
might
have
proposed
,
as
for
Sarah
Pocock
,
the
cold
*NL*
hospitality
of
his
own
salon
de
lecture
,
in
which
the
chill
of
Sarah
's
*NL*
visit
seemed
still
to
abide
and
shades
of
pleasure
were
dim
;
he
might
*NL*
have
suggested
a
stone
bench
in
the
dusty
Tuileries
or
a
penny
chair
at
*NL*
the
back
part
of
the
Champs
Elysees
.
These
things
would
have
been
a
*NL*
trifle
stern
,
and
sternness
alone
now
would
n't
be
sinister
.
An
*NL*
instinct
in
him
cast
about
for
some
form
of
discipline
in
which
they
*NL*
might
meet
--
some
awkwardness
they
would
suffer
from
,
some
danger
,
or
at
*NL*
least
some
grave
inconvenience
,
they
would
incur
.
This
would
give
a
*NL*
sense
--
which
the
spirit
required
,
rather
ached
and
sighed
in
the
*NL*
absence
of
--
that
somebody
was
paying
something
somewhere
and
somehow
,
*NL*
that
they
were
at
least
not
all
floating
together
on
the
silver
stream
*NL*
of
impunity
.
Just
instead
of
that
to
go
and
see
her
late
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
as
if
,
for
all
the
world
--
well
,
as
if
he
were
as
much
in
the
*NL*
swim
as
anybody
else
:
this
had
as
little
as
possible
in
common
with
*NL*
the
penal
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
he
had
felt
that
objection
melt
away
,
however
,
the
practical
*NL*
difference
was
small
;
the
long
stretch
of
his
interval
took
the
colour
*NL*
it
would
,
and
if
he
lived
on
thus
with
the
sinister
from
hour
to
hour
*NL*
it
proved
an
easier
thing
than
one
might
have
supposed
in
advance
.
He
*NL*
reverted
in
thought
to
his
old
tradition
,
the
one
he
had
been
brought
*NL*
up
on
and
which
even
so
many
years
of
life
had
but
little
worn
away
;
*NL*
the
notion
that
the
state
of
the
wrongdoer
,
or
at
least
this
person
's
*NL*
happiness
,
presented
some
special
difficulty
.
What
struck
him
now
*NL*
rather
was
the
ease
of
it
--
for
nothing
in
truth
appeared
easier
.
It
*NL*
was
an
ease
he
himself
fairly
tasted
of
for
the
rest
of
the
day
;
giving
*NL*
himself
quite
up
;
not
so
much
as
trying
to
dress
it
out
,
in
any
*NL*
particular
whatever
,
as
a
difficulty
;
not
after
all
going
to
see
*NL*
Maria
--
which
would
have
been
in
a
manner
a
result
of
such
dressing
;
*NL*
only
idling
,
lounging
,
smoking
,
sitting
in
the
shade
,
drinking
lemonade
*NL*
and
consuming
ices
.
The
day
had
turned
to
heat
and
eventual
thunder
,
*NL*
and
he
now
and
again
went
back
to
his
hotel
to
find
that
Chad
had
n't
*NL*
been
there
.
He
had
n't
yet
struck
himself
,
since
leaving
Woollett
,
so
*NL*
much
as
a
loafer
,
though
there
had
been
times
when
he
believed
himself
*NL*
touching
bottom
.
This
was
a
deeper
depth
than
any
,
and
with
no
*NL*
foresight
,
scarcely
with
a
care
,
as
to
what
he
should
bring
up
.
He
*NL*
almost
wondered
if
he
did
n't
LOOK
demoralised
and
disreputable
;
he
had
*NL*
the
fanciful
vision
,
as
he
sat
and
smoked
,
of
some
accidental
,
some
*NL*
motived
,
return
of
the
Pococks
,
who
would
be
passing
along
the
*NL*
Boulevard
and
would
catch
this
view
of
him
.
They
would
have
distinctly
,
*NL*
on
his
appearance
,
every
ground
for
scandal
.
But
fate
failed
to
*NL*
administer
even
that
sternness
;
the
Pococks
never
passed
and
Chad
made
*NL*
no
sign
.
Strether
meanwhile
continued
to
hold
off
from
Miss
Gostrey
,
*NL*
keeping
her
till
to-morrow
;
so
that
by
evening
his
irresponsibility
,
*NL*
his
impunity
,
his
luxury
,
had
become
--
there
was
no
other
word
for
*NL*
them
--
immense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
nine
and
ten
,
at
last
,
in
the
high
clear
picture
--
he
was
moving
*NL*
in
these
days
,
as
in
a
gallery
,
from
clever
canvas
to
clever
canvas
--
he
*NL*
drew
a
long
breath
:
it
was
so
presented
to
him
from
the
first
that
the
*NL*
spell
of
his
luxury
would
n't
be
broken
.
He
would
n't
have
,
that
is
,
to
*NL*
become
responsible
--
this
was
admirably
in
the
air
:
she
had
sent
for
him
*NL*
precisely
to
let
him
feel
it
,
so
that
he
might
go
on
with
the
comfort
*NL*
-LRB-
comfort
already
established
,
had
n't
it
been
?
-RRB-
of
regarding
his
ordeal
,
*NL*
the
ordeal
of
the
weeks
of
Sarah
's
stay
and
of
their
climax
,
as
safely
*NL*
traversed
and
left
behind
him
.
Did
n't
she
just
wish
to
assure
him
that
*NL*
SHE
now
took
it
all
and
so
kept
it
;
that
he
was
absolutely
not
to
worry
*NL*
any
more
,
was
only
to
rest
on
his
laurels
and
continue
generously
to
*NL*
help
her
?
The
light
in
her
beautiful
formal
room
was
dim
,
though
it
*NL*
would
do
,
as
everything
would
always
do
;
the
hot
night
had
kept
out
*NL*
lamps
,
but
there
was
a
pair
of
clusters
of
candles
that
glimmered
over
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
like
the
tall
tapers
of
an
altar
.
The
windows
were
*NL*
all
open
,
their
redundant
hangings
swaying
a
little
,
and
he
heard
once
*NL*
more
,
from
the
empty
court
,
the
small
plash
of
the
fountain
.
From
*NL*
beyond
this
,
and
as
from
a
great
distance
--
beyond
the
court
,
beyond
the
*NL*
corps
de
logis
forming
the
front
--
came
,
as
if
excited
and
exciting
,
the
*NL*
vague
voice
of
Paris
.
Strether
had
all
along
been
subject
to
sudden
*NL*
gusts
of
fancy
in
connexion
with
such
matters
as
these
--
odd
starts
of
*NL*
the
historic
sense
,
suppositions
and
divinations
with
no
warrant
but
*NL*
their
intensity
.
Thus
and
so
,
on
the
eve
of
the
great
recorded
dates
,
*NL*
the
days
and
nights
of
revolution
,
the
sounds
had
come
in
,
the
omens
,
*NL*
the
beginnings
broken
out
.
They
were
the
smell
of
revolution
,
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
public
temper
--
or
perhaps
simply
the
smell
of
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
present
queer
beyond
words
,
``
subtle
,
''
he
would
have
risked
*NL*
saying
,
that
such
suggestions
should
keep
crossing
the
scene
;
but
it
*NL*
was
doubtless
the
effect
of
the
thunder
in
the
air
,
which
had
hung
*NL*
about
all
day
without
release
.
His
hostess
was
dressed
as
for
*NL*
thunderous
times
,
and
it
fell
in
with
the
kind
of
imagination
we
have
*NL*
just
attributed
to
him
that
she
should
be
in
simplest
coolest
white
,
of
*NL*
a
character
so
old-fashioned
,
if
he
were
not
mistaken
,
that
Madame
*NL*
Roland
must
on
the
scaffold
have
worn
something
like
it
.
This
effect
*NL*
was
enhanced
by
a
small
black
fichu
or
scarf
,
of
crape
or
gauze
,
*NL*
disposed
quaintly
round
her
bosom
and
now
completing
as
by
a
mystic
*NL*
touch
the
pathetic
,
the
noble
analogy
.
Poor
Strether
in
fact
scarce
*NL*
knew
what
analogy
was
evoked
for
him
as
the
charming
woman
,
receiving
*NL*
him
and
making
him
,
as
she
could
do
such
things
,
at
once
familiarly
and
*NL*
gravely
welcome
,
moved
over
her
great
room
with
her
image
almost
*NL*
repeated
in
its
polished
floor
,
which
had
been
fully
bared
for
summer
.
*NL*
The
associations
of
the
place
,
all
felt
again
;
the
gleam
here
and
*NL*
there
,
in
the
subdued
light
,
of
glass
and
gilt
and
parquet
,
with
the
*NL*
quietness
of
her
own
note
as
the
centre
--
these
things
were
at
first
as
*NL*
delicate
as
if
they
had
been
ghostly
,
and
he
was
sure
in
a
moment
that
,
*NL*
whatever
he
should
find
he
had
come
for
,
it
would
n't
be
for
an
*NL*
impression
that
had
previously
failed
him
.
That
conviction
held
him
*NL*
from
the
outset
,
and
,
seeming
singularly
to
simplify
,
certified
to
him
*NL*
that
the
objects
about
would
help
him
,
would
really
help
them
both
.
No
,
*NL*
he
might
never
see
them
again
--
this
was
only
too
probably
the
last
*NL*
time
;
and
he
should
certainly
see
nothing
in
the
least
degree
like
*NL*
them
.
He
should
soon
be
going
to
where
such
things
were
not
,
and
it
*NL*
would
be
a
small
mercy
for
memory
,
for
fancy
,
to
have
,
in
that
stress
,
*NL*
a
loaf
on
the
shelf
.
He
knew
in
advance
he
should
look
back
on
the
*NL*
perception
actually
sharpest
with
him
as
on
the
view
of
something
old
,
*NL*
old
,
old
,
the
oldest
thing
he
had
ever
personally
touched
;
and
he
also
*NL*
knew
,
even
while
he
took
his
companion
in
as
the
feature
among
*NL*
features
,
that
memory
and
fancy
could
n't
help
being
enlisted
for
her
.
*NL*
She
might
intend
what
she
would
,
but
this
was
beyond
anything
she
could
*NL*
intend
,
with
things
from
far
back
--
tyrannies
of
history
,
facts
of
type
,
*NL*
values
,
as
the
painters
said
,
of
expression
--
all
working
for
her
and
*NL*
giving
her
the
supreme
chance
,
the
chance
of
the
happy
,
the
really
*NL*
luxurious
few
,
the
chance
,
on
a
great
occasion
,
to
be
natural
and
*NL*
simple
.
She
had
never
,
with
him
,
been
more
so
;
or
if
it
was
the
*NL*
perfection
of
art
it
would
never
--
and
that
came
to
the
same
thing
--
be
*NL*
proved
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
truly
wonderful
was
her
way
of
differing
so
from
time
to
time
*NL*
without
detriment
to
her
simplicity
.
Caprices
,
he
was
sure
she
felt
,
*NL*
were
before
anything
else
bad
manners
,
and
that
judgement
in
her
was
by
*NL*
itself
a
thing
making
more
for
safety
of
intercourse
than
anything
that
*NL*
in
his
various
own
past
intercourses
he
had
had
to
reckon
on
.
If
*NL*
therefore
her
presence
was
now
quite
other
than
the
one
she
had
shown
*NL*
him
the
night
before
,
there
was
nothing
of
violence
in
the
change
--
it
*NL*
was
all
harmony
and
reason
.
It
gave
him
a
mild
deep
person
,
whereas
he
*NL*
had
had
on
the
occasion
to
which
their
interview
was
a
direct
reference
*NL*
a
person
committed
to
movement
and
surface
and
abounding
in
them
;
but
*NL*
she
was
in
either
character
more
remarkable
for
nothing
than
for
her
*NL*
bridging
of
intervals
,
and
this
now
fell
in
with
what
he
understood
he
*NL*
was
to
leave
to
her
.
The
only
thing
was
that
,
if
he
was
to
leave
it
*NL*
ALL
to
her
,
why
exactly
had
she
sent
for
him
?
He
had
had
,
vaguely
,
in
*NL*
advance
,
his
explanation
,
his
view
of
the
probability
of
her
wishing
to
*NL*
set
something
right
,
to
deal
in
some
way
with
the
fraud
so
lately
*NL*
practised
on
his
presumed
credulity
.
Would
she
attempt
to
carry
it
*NL*
further
or
would
she
blot
it
out
?
Would
she
throw
over
it
some
more
or
*NL*
less
happy
colour
;
or
would
she
do
nothing
about
it
at
all
?
He
*NL*
perceived
soon
enough
at
least
that
,
however
reasonable
she
might
be
,
*NL*
she
was
n't
vulgarly
confused
,
and
it
herewith
pressed
upon
him
that
*NL*
their
eminent
``
lie
,
''
Chad
's
and
hers
,
was
simply
after
all
such
an
*NL*
inevitable
tribute
to
good
taste
as
he
could
n't
have
wished
them
not
to
*NL*
render
.
Away
from
them
,
during
his
vigil
,
he
had
seemed
to
wince
at
*NL*
the
amount
of
comedy
involved
;
whereas
in
his
present
posture
he
could
*NL*
only
ask
himself
how
he
should
enjoy
any
attempt
from
her
to
take
the
*NL*
comedy
back
.
He
should
n't
enjoy
it
at
all
;
but
,
once
more
and
yet
once
*NL*
more
,
he
could
trust
her
.
That
is
he
could
trust
her
to
make
deception
*NL*
right
.
As
she
presented
things
the
ugliness
--
goodness
knew
why
--
went
*NL*
out
of
them
;
none
the
less
too
that
she
could
present
them
,
with
an
art
*NL*
of
her
own
,
by
not
so
much
as
touching
them
.
She
let
the
matter
,
at
*NL*
all
events
,
lie
where
it
was
--
where
the
previous
twenty-four
hours
had
*NL*
placed
it
;
appearing
merely
to
circle
about
it
respectfully
,
tenderly
,
*NL*
almost
piously
,
while
she
took
up
another
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
she
had
n't
really
thrown
dust
in
his
eyes
;
this
,
the
previous
*NL*
night
,
before
they
separated
,
had
practically
passed
between
them
;
and
,
*NL*
as
she
had
sent
for
him
to
see
what
the
difference
thus
made
for
him
*NL*
might
amount
to
,
so
he
was
conscious
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
that
he
*NL*
had
been
tried
and
tested
.
She
had
settled
with
Chad
after
he
left
*NL*
them
that
she
would
,
for
her
satisfaction
,
assure
herself
of
this
*NL*
quantity
,
and
Chad
had
,
as
usual
,
let
her
have
her
way
.
Chad
was
*NL*
always
letting
people
have
their
way
when
he
felt
that
it
would
somehow
*NL*
turn
his
wheel
for
him
;
it
somehow
always
did
turn
his
wheel
.
Strether
*NL*
felt
,
oddly
enough
,
before
these
facts
,
freshly
and
consentingly
*NL*
passive
;
they
again
so
rubbed
it
into
him
that
the
couple
thus
fixing
*NL*
his
attention
were
intimate
,
that
his
intervention
had
absolutely
aided
*NL*
and
intensified
their
intimacy
,
and
that
in
fine
he
must
accept
the
*NL*
consequence
of
that
.
He
had
absolutely
become
,
himself
,
with
his
*NL*
perceptions
and
his
mistakes
,
his
concessions
and
his
reserves
,
the
*NL*
droll
mixture
,
as
it
must
seem
to
them
,
of
his
braveries
and
his
fears
,
*NL*
the
general
spectacle
of
his
art
and
his
innocence
,
almost
an
added
*NL*
link
and
certainly
a
common
priceless
ground
for
them
to
meet
upon
.
It
*NL*
was
as
if
he
had
been
hearing
their
very
tone
when
she
brought
out
a
*NL*
reference
that
was
comparatively
straight
.
``
The
last
twice
that
you
've
*NL*
been
here
,
you
know
,
I
never
asked
you
,
''
she
said
with
an
abrupt
*NL*
transition
--
they
had
been
pretending
before
this
to
talk
simply
of
the
*NL*
charm
of
yesterday
and
of
the
interest
of
the
country
they
had
seen
.
*NL*
The
effort
was
confessedly
vain
;
not
for
such
talk
had
she
invited
him
;
*NL*
and
her
impatient
reminder
was
of
their
having
done
for
it
all
the
*NL*
needful
on
his
coming
to
her
after
Sarah
's
flight
.
What
she
had
n't
*NL*
asked
him
then
was
to
state
to
her
where
and
how
he
stood
for
her
;
she
*NL*
had
been
resting
on
Chad
's
report
of
their
midnight
hour
together
in
*NL*
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
.
The
thing
therefore
she
at
present
desired
*NL*
was
ushered
in
by
this
recall
of
the
two
occasions
on
which
,
*NL*
disinterested
and
merciful
,
she
had
n't
worried
him
.
To-night
truly
she
*NL*
WOULD
worry
him
,
and
this
was
her
appeal
to
him
to
let
her
risk
it
.
He
*NL*
was
n't
to
mind
if
she
bored
him
a
little
:
she
had
behaved
,
after
*NL*
all
--
had
n't
she
?
--
so
awfully
,
awfully
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
all
right
,
you
're
all
right
,
''
he
almost
impatiently
*NL*
declared
;
his
impatience
being
moreover
not
for
her
pressure
,
but
for
*NL*
her
scruple
.
More
and
more
distinct
to
him
was
the
tune
to
which
she
*NL*
would
have
had
the
matter
out
with
Chad
:
more
and
more
vivid
for
him
*NL*
the
idea
that
she
had
been
nervous
as
to
what
he
might
be
able
to
*NL*
``
stand
.
''
Yes
,
it
had
been
a
question
if
he
had
``
stood
''
what
the
scene
*NL*
on
the
river
had
given
him
,
and
,
though
the
young
man
had
doubtless
*NL*
opined
in
favour
of
his
recuperation
,
her
own
last
word
must
have
been
*NL*
that
she
should
feel
easier
in
seeing
for
herself
.
That
was
it
,
*NL*
unmistakeably
;
she
WAS
seeing
for
herself
.
What
he
could
stand
was
*NL*
thus
,
in
these
moments
,
in
the
balance
for
Strether
,
who
reflected
,
as
*NL*
he
became
fully
aware
of
it
,
that
he
must
properly
brace
himself
.
He
*NL*
wanted
fully
to
appear
to
stand
all
he
might
;
and
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
command
of
the
situation
for
him
in
this
very
wish
not
to
look
too
much
*NL*
at
sea
.
She
was
ready
with
everything
,
but
so
,
sufficiently
,
was
he
;
*NL*
that
is
he
was
at
one
point
the
more
prepared
of
the
two
,
inasmuch
as
,
*NL*
for
all
her
cleverness
,
she
could
n't
produce
on
the
spot
--
and
it
was
*NL*
surprising
--
an
account
of
the
motive
of
her
note
.
He
had
the
advantage
*NL*
that
his
pronouncing
her
``
all
right
''
gave
him
for
an
enquiry
.
``
May
I
*NL*
ask
,
delighted
as
I
've
been
to
come
,
if
you
've
wished
to
say
something
*NL*
special
?
''
He
spoke
as
if
she
might
have
seen
he
had
been
waiting
for
*NL*
it
--
not
indeed
with
discomfort
,
but
with
natural
interest
.
Then
he
saw
*NL*
that
she
was
a
little
taken
aback
,
was
even
surprised
herself
at
the
*NL*
detail
she
had
neglected
--
the
only
one
ever
yet
;
having
somehow
assumed
*NL*
he
would
know
,
would
recognise
,
would
leave
some
things
not
to
be
said
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
however
,
an
instant
as
if
to
convey
that
if
he
*NL*
wanted
them
ALL
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Selfish
and
vulgar
--
that
's
what
I
must
seem
to
you
.
You
've
done
*NL*
everything
for
me
,
and
here
I
am
as
if
I
were
asking
for
more
.
But
it
*NL*
is
n't
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
because
I
'm
afraid
--
though
I
AM
of
course
afraid
,
*NL*
as
a
woman
in
my
position
always
is
.
I
mean
it
is
n't
because
one
lives
*NL*
in
terror
--
it
is
n't
because
of
that
one
is
selfish
,
for
I
'm
ready
to
*NL*
give
you
my
word
to-night
that
I
do
n't
care
;
do
n't
care
what
still
may
*NL*
happen
and
what
I
may
lose
.
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
raise
your
little
*NL*
finger
for
me
again
,
nor
do
I
wish
so
much
as
to
mention
to
you
what
*NL*
we
've
talked
of
before
,
either
my
danger
or
my
safety
,
or
his
mother
,
*NL*
or
his
sister
,
or
the
girl
he
may
marry
,
or
the
fortune
he
may
make
or
*NL*
miss
,
or
the
right
or
the
wrong
,
of
any
kind
,
he
may
do
.
If
after
the
*NL*
help
one
has
had
from
you
one
ca
n't
either
take
care
of
one
's
self
or
*NL*
simply
hold
one
's
tongue
,
one
must
renounce
all
claim
to
be
an
object
*NL*
of
interest
.
It
's
in
the
name
of
what
I
DO
care
about
that
I
've
tried
*NL*
still
to
keep
hold
of
you
.
How
can
I
be
indifferent
,
''
she
asked
,
``
to
*NL*
how
I
appear
to
you
?
''
And
as
he
found
himself
unable
immediately
to
*NL*
say
:
``
Why
,
if
you
're
going
,
NEED
you
,
after
all
?
Is
it
impossible
you
*NL*
should
stay
on
--
so
that
one
may
n't
lose
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
I
should
live
with
you
here
instead
of
going
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
`
with
'
us
,
if
you
object
to
that
,
but
near
enough
to
us
,
*NL*
somewhere
,
for
us
to
see
you
--
well
,
''
she
beautifully
brought
out
,
``
when
*NL*
we
feel
we
MUST
.
How
shall
we
not
sometimes
feel
it
?
I
've
wanted
to
*NL*
see
you
often
when
I
could
n't
,
''
she
pursued
,
``
all
these
last
weeks
.
How
*NL*
sha
n't
I
then
miss
you
now
,
with
the
sense
of
your
being
gone
forever
?
''
*NL*
Then
as
if
the
straightness
of
this
appeal
,
taking
him
unprepared
,
had
*NL*
visibly
left
him
wondering
:
``
Where
IS
your
`
home
'
moreover
now
--
what
*NL*
has
become
of
it
?
I
've
made
a
change
in
your
life
,
I
know
I
have
;
I
've
*NL*
upset
everything
in
your
mind
as
well
;
in
your
sense
of
--
what
shall
I
*NL*
call
it
?
--
all
the
decencies
and
possibilities
.
It
gives
me
a
kind
of
*NL*
detestation
--
''
She
pulled
up
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
but
he
wanted
to
hear
.
``
Detestation
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
everything
--
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
that
's
too
much
,
''
he
laughed
--
``
or
too
little
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
little
,
precisely
''
--
she
was
eager
.
``
What
I
hate
is
myself
--
when
I
*NL*
think
that
one
has
to
take
so
much
,
to
be
happy
,
out
of
the
lives
of
*NL*
others
,
and
that
one
is
n't
happy
even
then
.
One
does
it
to
cheat
one
's
*NL*
self
and
to
stop
one
's
mouth
--
but
that
's
only
at
the
best
for
a
little
.
*NL*
The
wretched
self

always
there
,
always
making
one
somehow
a
fresh
*NL*
anxiety

it
comes
to
is
that

not

any
happiness

The

It

false

Interesting
,
touching
,
*NL*
strikingly
sincere
as
she
let
these
things
come
from
her
,
she
yet
*NL*
puzzled
and
troubled
him
--
so
fine
was
the
quaver
of
her
quietness
.
He
*NL*
felt
what
he
had
felt
before
with
her
,
that
there
was
always
more
*NL*
behind
what
she
showed
,
and
more
and
more
again
behind
that
.
``
You
know
*NL*
so
,
at
least
,
''
she
added
,
``
where
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU
ought
to
know
it
indeed
then
;
for
is
n't
what
you
've
been
giving
*NL*
exactly
what
has
brought
us
together
this
way
?
You
've
been
making
,
as
*NL*
I
've
so
fully
let
you
know
I
've
felt
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
the
most
*NL*
precious
present
I
've
ever
seen
made
,
and
if
you
ca
n't
sit
down
*NL*
peacefully
on
that
performance
you
ARE
,
no
doubt
,
born
to
torment
*NL*
yourself
.
But
you
ought
,
''
he
wound
up
,
``
to
be
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
trouble
you
any
more
,
no
doubt
--
not
thrust
on
you
even
the
*NL*
wonder
and
the
beauty
of
what
I
've
done
;
only
let
you
regard
our
*NL*
business
as
over
,
and
well
over
,
and
see
you
depart
in
a
peace
that
*NL*
matches
my
own
?
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
''
she
nervously
*NL*
repeated
--
``
all
the
more
that
I
do
n't
really
pretend
I
believe
you
*NL*
could
n't
,
for
yourself
,
NOT
have
done
what
you
have
.
I
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
you
feel
yourself
victimised
,
for
this
evidently
is
the
way
you
live
,
*NL*
and
it
's
what
--
we
're
agreed
--
is
the
best
way
.
Yes
,
as
you
say
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
after
a
moment
,
``
I
ought
to
be
easy
and
rest
on
my
work
.
Well
*NL*
then
here
am
I
doing
so
.
I
AM
easy
.
You
'll
have
it
for
your
last
*NL*
impression
.
When
is
it
you
say
you
go
?
''
she
asked
with
a
quick
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
some
time
to
reply
--
his
last
impression
was
more
and
more
so
*NL*
mixed
a
one
.
It
produced
in
him
a
vague
disappointment
,
a
drop
that
*NL*
was
deeper
even
than
the
fall
of
his
elation
the
previous
night
.
The
*NL*
good
of
what
he
had
done
,
if
he
had
done
so
much
,
was
n't
there
to
*NL*
enliven
him
quite
to
the
point
that
would
have
been
ideal
for
a
grand
*NL*
gay
finale
.
Women
were
thus
endlessly
absorbent
,
and
to
deal
with
them
*NL*
was
to
walk
on
water
.
What
was
at
bottom
the
matter
with
her
,
*NL*
embroider
as
she
might
and
disclaim
as
she
might
--
what
was
at
bottom
*NL*
the
matter
with
her
was
simply
Chad
himself
.
It
was
of
Chad
she
was
*NL*
after
all
renewedly
afraid
;
the
strange
strength
of
her
passion
was
the
*NL*
very
strength
of
her
fear
;
she
clung
to
HIM
,
Lambert
Strether
,
as
to
a
*NL*
source
of
safety
she
had
tested
,
and
,
generous
graceful
truthful
as
she
*NL*
might
try
to
be
,
exquisite
as
she
was
,
she
dreaded
the
term
of
his
*NL*
being
within
reach
.
With
this
sharpest
perception
yet
,
it
was
like
a
*NL*
chill
in
the
air
to
him
,
it
was
almost
appalling
,
that
a
creature
so
*NL*
fine
could
be
,
by
mysterious
forces
,
a
creature
so
exploited
.
For
at
*NL*
the
end
of
all
things
they
WERE
mysterious
:
she
had
but
made
Chad
what
*NL*
he
was
--
so
why
could
she
think
she
had
made
him
infinite
?
She
had
made
*NL*
him
better
,
she
had
made
him
best
,
she
had
made
him
anything
one
would
;
*NL*
but
it
came
to
our
friend
with
supreme
queerness
that
he
was
none
the
*NL*
less
only
Chad
.
Strether
had
the
sense
that
HE
,
a
little
,
had
made
him
*NL*
too
;
his
high
appreciation
had
as
it
were
,
consecrated
her
work
The
*NL*
work
,
however
admirable
,
was
nevertheless
of
the
strict
human
order
,
*NL*
and
in
short
it
was
marvellous
that
the
companion
of
mere
earthly
joys
,
*NL*
of
comforts
,
aberrations
-LRB-
however
one
classed
them
-RRB-
within
the
common
*NL*
experience
should
be
so
transcendently
prized
.
It
might
have
made
*NL*
Strether
hot
or
shy
,
as
such
secrets
of
others
brought
home
sometimes
*NL*
do
make
us
;
but
he
was
held
there
by
something
so
hard
that
it
was
*NL*
fairly
grim
.
This
was
not
the
discomposure
of
last
night
;
that
had
*NL*
quite
passed
--
such
discomposures
were
a
detail
;
the
real
coercion
was
*NL*
to
see
a
man
ineffably
adored
.
There
it
was
again
--
it
took
women
,
it
*NL*
took
women
;
if
to
deal
with
them
was
to
walk
on
water
what
wonder
that
*NL*
the
water
rose
?
And
it
had
never
surely
risen
higher
than
round
this
*NL*
woman
.
He
presently
found
himself
taking
a
long
look
from
her
,
and
the
*NL*
next
thing
he
knew
he
had
uttered
all
his
thought
.
``
You
're
afraid
for
*NL*
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
drew
out
her
long
look
,
and
he
soon
enough
saw
why
.
A
spasm
came
*NL*
into
her
face
,
the
tears
she
had
already
been
unable
to
hide
overflowed
*NL*
at
first
in
silence
,
and
then
,
as
the
sound
suddenly
comes
from
a
*NL*
child
,
quickened
to
gasps
,
to
sobs
.
She
sat
and
covered
her
face
with
*NL*
her
hands
,
giving
up
all
attempt
at
a
manner
.
``
It
's
how
you
see
me
,
*NL*
it
's
how
you
see
me
''
--
she
caught
her
breath
with
it
--
``
and
it
's
as
I
AM
,
*NL*
and
as
I
must
take
myself
,
and
of
course
it
's
no
matter
.
''
Her
emotion
*NL*
was
at
first
so
incoherent
that
he
could
only
stand
there
at
a
loss
,
*NL*
stand
with
his
sense
of
having
upset
her
,
though
of
having
done
it
by
*NL*
the
truth
.
He
had
to
listen
to
her
in
a
silence
that
he
made
no
*NL*
immediate
effort
to
attenuate
,
feeling
her
doubly
woeful
amid
all
her
*NL*
dim
diffused
elegance
;
consenting
to
it
as
he
had
consented
to
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
even
conscious
of
some
vague
inward
irony
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
such
a
fine
free
range
of
bliss
and
bale
.
He
could
n't
say
it
was
NOT
*NL*
no
matter
;
for
he
was
serving
her
to
the
end
,
he
now
knew
,
*NL*
anyway
--
quite
as
if
what
he
thought
of
her
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
It
was
actually
moreover
as
if
he
did
n't
think
of
her
at
all
,
as
if
he
*NL*
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
passion
,
mature
,
abysmal
,
pitiful
,
she
*NL*
represented
,
and
the
possibilities
she
betrayed
.
She
was
older
for
him
*NL*
to-night
,
visibly
less
exempt
from
the
touch
of
time
;
but
she
was
as
*NL*
much
as
ever
the
finest
and
subtlest
creature
,
the
happiest
apparition
,
*NL*
it
had
been
given
him
,
in
all
his
years
,
to
meet
;
and
yet
he
could
see
*NL*
her
there
as
vulgarly
troubled
,
in
very
truth
,
as
a
maidservant
crying
*NL*
for
her
young
man
.
The
only
thing
was
that
she
judged
herself
as
the
*NL*
maidservant
would
n't
;
the
weakness
of
which
wisdom
too
,
the
dishonour
*NL*
of
which
judgement
,
seemed
but
to
sink
her
lower
.
Her
collapse
,
*NL*
however
,
no
doubt
,
was
briefer
and
she
had
in
a
manner
recovered
*NL*
herself
before
he
intervened
.
``
Of
course
I
'm
afraid
for
my
life
.
But
*NL*
that
's
nothing
.
It
is
n't
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
a
little
longer
,
as
if
thinking
what
it
might
be
.
*NL*
``
There
's
something
I
have
in
mind
that
I
can
still
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
threw
off
at
last
,
with
a
sharp
sad
headshake
,
drying
her
eyes
,
*NL*
what
he
could
still
do
.
``
I
do
n't
care
for
that
.
Of
course
,
as
I
've
*NL*
said
,
you
're
acting
,
in
your
wonderful
way
,
for
yourself
;
and
what
's
*NL*
for
yourself
is
no
more
my
business
--
though
I
may
reach
out
unholy
*NL*
hands
so
clumsily
to
touch
it
--
than
if
it
were
something
in
Timbuctoo
.
*NL*
It
's
only
that
you
do
n't
snub
me
,
as
you
've
had
fifty
chances
to
*NL*
do
--
it
's
only
your
beautiful
patience
that
makes
one
forget
one
's
*NL*
manners
.
In
spite
of
your
patience
,
all
the
same
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
you
'd
*NL*
do
anything
rather
than
be
with
us
here
,
even
if
that
were
possible
.
*NL*
You
'd
do
everything
for
us
but
be
mixed
up
with
us
--
which
is
a
*NL*
statement
you
can
easily
answer
to
the
advantage
of
your
own
manners
.
*NL*
You
can
say
`
What
's
the
use
of
talking
of
things
that
at
the
best
are
*NL*
impossible
?
'
What
IS
of
course
the
use
?
It
's
only
my
little
madness

*NL*
You
'd
talk
if
you
were
tormented

And
I
do
n't
mean
now
about
HIM

Oh
*NL*
for
him

!

Positively
,
strangely
,
bitterly
,
as
it
seemed
to
Strether
,
*NL*
she
gave
``
him
,
''
for
the
moment
,
away
.
``
You
do

she
added

gained
time

But
he
had
already
stopped
her

further

``
That

perfectly
false

she
returned
--
``

At

He
could
only
after
a
moment
re-echo
Miss
Barrace
.
``
You
're
wonderful

``

went
on

which
she
came
back
again

face
to
face
with

had
so
quite
broken
down

She
exhaled
it
into
air

took
refuge
in
repeating
something
he
had
already
said

that

had
made
nothing
of

There
's
something

he
put
his
hand
out
for
good-bye

She
again
made
nothing

went
on
with

insistence

She
had

taken

moved
with

to

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
purpose
had
been
to
see
Chad
the
next
day
,
and
he
had
prefigured
*NL*
seeing
him
by
an
early
call
;
having
in
general
never
stood
on
ceremony
*NL*
in
respect
to
visits
at
the
Boulevard
Malesherbes
.
It
had
been
more
*NL*
often
natural
for
him
to
go
there
than
for
Chad
to
come
to
the
small
*NL*
hotel
,
the
attractions
of
which
were
scant
;
yet
it
nevertheless
,
just
*NL*
now
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
did
suggest
itself
to
Strether
to
begin
by
*NL*
giving
the
young
man
a
chance
.
It
struck
him
that
,
in
the
inevitable
*NL*
course
,
Chad
would
be
``
round
,
''
as
Waymarsh
used
to
say
--
Waymarsh
who
*NL*
already
,
somehow
,
seemed
long
ago
.
He
had
n't
come
the
day
before
,
*NL*
because
it
had
been
arranged
between
them
that
Madame
de
Vionnet
should
*NL*
see
their
friend
first
;
but
now
that
this
passage
had
taken
place
he
*NL*
would
present
himself
,
and
their
friend
would
n't
have
long
to
wait
.
*NL*
Strether
assumed
,
he
became
aware
,
on
this
reasoning
,
that
the
*NL*
interesting
parties
to
the
arrangement
would
have
met
betimes
,
and
that
*NL*
the
more
interesting
of
the
two
--
as
she
was
after
all
--
would
have
*NL*
communicated
to
the
other
the
issue
of
her
appeal
.
Chad
would
know
*NL*
without
delay
that
his
mother
's
messenger
had
been
with
her
,
and
,
*NL*
though
it
was
perhaps
not
quite
easy
to
see
how
she
could
qualify
what
*NL*
had
occurred
,
he
would
at
least
have
been
sufficiently
advised
to
feel
*NL*
he
could
go
on
.
The
day
,
however
,
brought
,
early
or
late
,
no
word
from
*NL*
him
,
and
Strether
felt
,
as
a
result
of
this
,
that
a
change
had
*NL*
practically
come
over
their
intercourse
.
It
was
perhaps
a
premature
*NL*
judgement
;
or
it
only
meant
perhaps
--
how
could
he
tell
?
--
that
the
*NL*
wonderful
pair
he
protected
had
taken
up
again
together
the
excursion
*NL*
he
had
accidentally
checked
.
They
might
have
gone
back
to
the
country
,
*NL*
and
gone
back
but
with
a
long
breath
drawn
;
that
indeed
would
best
mark
*NL*
Chad
's
sense
that
reprobation
had
n't
rewarded
Madame
de
Vionnet
's
*NL*
request
for
an
interview
.
At
the
end
of
the
twenty-four
hours
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
forty-eight
,
there
was
still
no
overture
;
so
that
Strether
*NL*
filled
up
the
time
,
as
he
had
so
often
filled
it
before
,
by
going
to
*NL*
see
Miss
Gostrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
proposed
amusements
to
her
;
he
felt
expert
now
in
proposing
*NL*
amusements
;
and
he
had
thus
,
for
several
days
,
an
odd
sense
of
leading
*NL*
her
about
Paris
,
of
driving
her
in
the
Bois
,
of
showing
her
the
penny
*NL*
steamboats
--
those
from
which
the
breeze
of
the
Seine
was
to
be
best
*NL*
enjoyed
--
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
kindly
uncle
doing
the
honours
*NL*
of
the
capital
to
an
Intelligent
niece
from
the
country
.
He
found
*NL*
means
even
to
take
her
to
shops
she
did
n't
know
,
or
that
she
pretended
*NL*
she
did
n't
;
while
she
,
on
her
side
,
was
,
like
the
country
maiden
,
all
*NL*
passive
modest
and
grateful
--
going
in
fact
so
far
as
to
emulate
*NL*
rusticity
in
occasional
fatigues
and
bewilderments
.
Strether
described
*NL*
these
vague
proceedings
to
himself
,
described
them
even
to
her
,
as
a
*NL*
happy
interlude
;
the
sign
of
which
was
that
the
companions
said
for
the
*NL*
time
no
further
word
about
the
matter
they
had
talked
of
to
satiety
.
He
*NL*
proclaimed
satiety
at
the
outset
,
and
she
quickly
took
the
hint
;
as
*NL*
docile
both
in
this
and
in
everything
else
as
the
intelligent
obedient
*NL*
niece
.
He
told
her
as
yet
nothing
of
his
late
adventure
--
for
as
an
*NL*
adventure
it
now
ranked
with
him
;
he
pushed
the
whole
business
*NL*
temporarily
aside
and
found
his
interest
in
the
fact
of
her
beautiful
*NL*
assent
.
She
left
questions
unasked
--
she
who
for
so
long
had
been
all
*NL*
questions
;
she
gave
herself
up
to
him
with
an
understanding
of
which
*NL*
mere
mute
gentleness
might
have
seemed
the
sufficient
expression
.
She
*NL*
knew
his
sense
of
his
situation
had
taken
still
another
step
--
of
that
*NL*
he
was
quite
aware
;
but
she
conveyed
that
,
whatever
had
thus
happened
*NL*
for
him
,
it
was
thrown
into
the
shade
by
what
was
happening
for
*NL*
herself
.
This
--
though
it
might
n't
to
a
detached
spirit
have
seemed
*NL*
much
--
was
the
major
interest
,
and
she
met
it
with
a
new
directness
of
*NL*
response
,
measuring
it
from
hour
to
hour
with
her
grave
hush
of
*NL*
acceptance
.
Touched
as
he
had
so
often
been
by
her
before
,
he
was
,
for
*NL*
his
part
too
,
touched
afresh
;
all
the
more
that
though
he
could
be
duly
*NL*
aware
of
the
principle
of
his
own
mood
he
could
n't
be
equally
so
of
the
*NL*
principle
of
hers
.
He
knew
,
that
is
,
in
a
manner
--
knew
roughly
and
*NL*
resignedly
--
what
he
himself
was
hatching
;
whereas
he
had
to
take
the
*NL*
chance
of
what
he
called
to
himself
Maria
's
calculations
.
It
was
all
*NL*
he
needed
that
she
liked
him
enough
for
what
they
were
doing
,
and
even
*NL*
should
they
do
a
good
deal
more
would
still
like
him
enough
for
that
;
*NL*
the
essential
freshness
of
a
relation
so
simple
was
a
cool
bath
to
the
*NL*
soreness
produced
by
other
relations
.
These
others
appeared
to
him
now
*NL*
horribly
complex
;
they
bristled
with
fine
points
,
points
all
*NL*
unimaginable
beforehand
,
points
that
pricked
and
drew
blood
;
a
fact
*NL*
that
gave
to
an
hour
with
his
present
friend
on
a
bateau-mouche
,
or
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
shade
of
the
Champs
Elysees
,
something
of
the
innocent
*NL*
pleasure
of
handling
rounded
ivory
.
His
relation
with
Chad
*NL*
personally
--
from
the
moment
he
had
got
his
point
of
view
--
had
been
of
*NL*
the
simplest
;
yet
this
also
struck
him
as
bristling
,
after
a
third
and
*NL*
a
fourth
blank
day
had
passed
.
It
was
as
if
at
last
however
his
care
*NL*
for
such
indications
had
dropped
;
there
came
a
fifth
blank
day
and
he
*NL*
ceased
to
enquire
or
to
heed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
took
on
to
his
fancy
,
Miss
Gostrey
and
he
,
the
image
of
the
*NL*
Babes
in
the
Wood
;
they
could
trust
the
merciful
elements
to
let
them
*NL*
continue
at
peace
.
He
had
been
great
already
,
as
he
knew
,
at
*NL*
postponements
;
but
he
had
only
to
get
afresh
into
the
rhythm
of
one
to
*NL*
feel
its
fine
attraction
.
It
amused
him
to
say
to
himself
that
he
*NL*
might
for
all
the
world
have
been
going
to
die
--
die
resignedly
;
the
*NL*
scene
was
filled
for
him
with
so
deep
a
death-bed
hush
,
so
melancholy
a
*NL*
charm
.
That
meant
the
postponement
of
everything
else
--
which
made
so
*NL*
for
the
quiet
lapse
of
life
;
and
the
postponement
in
especial
of
the
*NL*
reckoning
to
come
--
unless
indeed
the
reckoning
to
come
were
to
be
one
*NL*
and
the
same
thing
with
extinction
.
It
faced
him
,
the
reckoning
,
over
*NL*
the
shoulder
of
much
interposing
experience
--
which
also
faced
him
;
and
*NL*
one
would
float
to
it
doubtless
duly
through
these
caverns
of
Kubla
*NL*
Khan
.
It
was
really
behind
everything
;
it
had
n't
merged
in
what
he
had
*NL*
done
;
his
final
appreciation
of
what
he
had
done
--
his
appreciation
on
*NL*
the
spot
--
would
provide
it
with
its
main
sharpness
.
The
spot
so
*NL*
focussed
was
of
course
Woollett
,
and
he
was
to
see
,
at
the
best
,
what
*NL*
Woollett
would
be
with
everything
there
changed
for
him
.
Would
n't
THAT
*NL*
revelation
practically
amount
to
the
wind-up
of
his
career
?
Well
,
the
*NL*
summer
's
end
would
show
;
his
suspense
had
meanwhile
exactly
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
vain
delay
;
and
he
had
with
it
,
we
should
mention
,
other
*NL*
pastimes
than
Maria
's
company
--
plenty
of
separate
musings
in
which
his
*NL*
luxury
failed
him
but
at
one
point
.
He
was
well
in
port
,
the
outer
sea
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
it
was
only
a
matter
of
getting
ashore
.
There
was
a
*NL*
question
that
came
and
went
for
him
,
however
,
as
he
rested
against
the
*NL*
side
of
his
ship
,
and
it
was
a
little
to
get
rid
of
the
obsession
that
*NL*
he
prolonged
his
hours
with
Miss
Gostrey
.
It
was
a
question
about
*NL*
himself
,
but
it
could
only
be
settled
by
seeing
Chad
again
;
it
was
*NL*
indeed
his
principal
reason
for
wanting
to
see
Chad
.
After
that
it
*NL*
would
n't
signify
--
it
was
a
ghost
that
certain
words
would
easily
lay
to
*NL*
rest
.
Only
the
young
man
must
be
there
to
take
the
words
.
Once
they
*NL*
were
taken
he
would
n't
have
a
question
left
;
none
,
that
is
,
in
*NL*
connexion
with
this
particular
affair
.
It
would
n't
then
matter
even
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
might
now
have
been
guilty
of
speaking
BECAUSE
of
what
*NL*
he
had
forfeited
.
That
was
the
refinement
of
his
supreme
scruple
--
he
*NL*
wished
so
to
leave
what
he
had
forfeited
out
of
account
.
He
wished
not
*NL*
to
do
anything
because
he
had
missed
something
else
,
because
he
was
*NL*
sore
or
sorry
or
impoverished
,
because
he
was
maltreated
or
desperate
;
*NL*
he
wished
to
do
everything
because
he
was
lucid
and
quiet
,
just
the
*NL*
same
for
himself
on
all
essential
points
as
he
had
ever
been
.
Thus
it
*NL*
was
that
while
he
virtually
hung
about
for
Chad
he
kept
mutely
putting
*NL*
it
:
``
You
've
been
chucked
,
old
boy
;
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
It
would
have
sickened
him
to
feel
vindictive
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
tints
of
feeling
indeed
were
doubtless
but
the
iridescence
of
his
*NL*
idleness
,
and
they
were
presently
lost
in
a
new
light
from
Maria
.
She
*NL*
had
a
fresh
fact
for
him
before
the
week
was
out
,
and
she
practically
*NL*
met
him
with
it
on
his
appearing
one
night
.
He
had
n't
on
this
day
seen
*NL*
her
,
but
had
planned
presenting
himself
in
due
course
to
ask
her
to
*NL*
dine
with
him
somewhere
out
of
doors
,
on
one
of
the
terraces
,
in
one
of
*NL*
the
gardens
,
of
which
the
Paris
of
summer
was
profuse
.
It
had
then
*NL*
come
on
to
rain
,
so
that
,
disconcerted
,
he
changed
his
mind
;
dining
*NL*
alone
at
home
,
a
little
stuffily
and
stupidly
,
and
waiting
on
her
*NL*
afterwards
to
make
up
his
loss
.
He
was
sure
within
a
minute
that
*NL*
something
had
happened
;
it
was
so
in
the
air
of
the
rich
little
room
*NL*
that
he
had
scarcely
to
name
his
thought
.
Softly
lighted
,
the
whole
*NL*
colour
of
the
place
,
with
its
vague
values
,
was
in
cool
fusion
--
an
*NL*
effect
that
made
the
visitor
stand
for
a
little
agaze
.
It
was
as
if
in
*NL*
doing
so
now
he
had
felt
a
recent
presence
--
his
recognition
of
the
*NL*
passage
of
which
his
hostess
in
turn
divined
.
She
had
scarcely
to
say
*NL*
it
--
``
Yes
,
she
has
been
here
,
and
this
time
I
received
her
.
''
It
was
n't
*NL*
till
a
minute
later
that
she
added
:
``
There
being
,
as
I
understand
you
,
*NL*
no
reason
NOW
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
for
your
refusing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
if
you
've
done
what
you
've
had
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
certainly
so
far
done
it
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
as
that
you
need
n't
*NL*
fear
the
effect
,
or
the
appearance
of
coming
between
us
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
between
us
now
but
what
we
ourselves
have
put
there
,
and
not
an
*NL*
inch
of
room
for
anything
else
whatever
.
Therefore
you
're
only
*NL*
beautifully
WITH
us
as
always
--
though
doubtless
now
,
if
she
has
talked
*NL*
to
you
,
rather
more
with
us
than
less
.
Of
course
if
she
came
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
``
it
was
to
talk
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
talk
to
me
,
''
Maria
returned
;
on
which
he
was
further
sure
*NL*
that
she
was
practically
in
possession
of
what
he
himself
had
n't
yet
*NL*
told
her
.
He
was
even
sure
she
was
in
possession
of
things
he
himself
*NL*
could
n't
have
told
;
for
the
consciousness
of
them
was
now
all
in
her
*NL*
face
and
accompanied
there
with
a
shade
of
sadness
that
marked
in
her
*NL*
the
close
of
all
uncertainties
.
It
came
out
for
him
more
than
ever
yet
*NL*
that
she
had
had
from
the
first
a
knowledge
she
believed
him
not
to
*NL*
have
had
,
a
knowledge
the
sharp
acquisition
of
which
might
be
destined
*NL*
to
make
a
difference
for
him
.
The
difference
for
him
might
not
*NL*
inconceivably
be
an
arrest
of
his
independence
and
a
change
in
his
*NL*
attitude
--
in
other
words
a
revulsion
in
favour
of
the
principles
of
*NL*
Woollett
.
She
had
really
prefigured
the
possibility
of
a
shock
that
*NL*
would
send
him
swinging
back
to
Mrs.
Newsome
.
He
had
n't
,
it
was
true
,
*NL*
week
after
week
,
shown
signs
of
receiving
it
,
but
the
possibility
had
*NL*
been
none
the
less
in
the
air
.
What
Maria
accordingly
had
had
now
to
*NL*
take
in
was
that
the
shock
had
descended
and
that
he
had
n't
,
all
the
*NL*
same
,
swung
back
.
He
had
grown
clear
,
in
a
flash
,
on
a
point
long
*NL*
since
settled
for
herself
;
but
no
reapproximation
to
Mrs.
Newsome
had
*NL*
occurred
in
consequence
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
by
her
visit
held
up
*NL*
the
torch
to
these
truths
,
and
what
now
lingered
in
poor
Maria
's
face
*NL*
was
the
somewhat
smoky
light
of
the
scene
between
them
.
If
the
light
*NL*
however
was
n't
,
as
we
have
hinted
,
the
glow
of
joy
,
the
reasons
for
*NL*
this
also
were
perhaps
discernible
to
Strether
even
through
the
blur
*NL*
cast
over
them
by
his
natural
modesty
.
She
had
held
herself
for
months
*NL*
with
a
firm
hand
;
she
had
n't
interfered
on
any
chance
--
and
chances
were
*NL*
specious
enough
--
that
she
might
interfere
to
her
profit
.
She
had
*NL*
turned
her
back
on
the
dream
that
Mrs.
Newsome
's
rupture
,
their
*NL*
friend
's
forfeiture
--
the
engagement
the
relation
itself
,
broken
beyond
*NL*
all
mending
--
might
furnish
forth
her
advantage
;
and
,
to
stay
her
hand
*NL*
from
promoting
these
things
,
she
had
on
private
,
difficult
,
but
rigid
,
*NL*
lines
,
played
strictly
fair
.
She
could
n't
therefore
but
feel
that
,
*NL*
though
,
as
the
end
of
all
,
the
facts
in
question
had
been
stoutly
*NL*
confirmed
,
her
ground
for
personal
,
for
what
might
have
been
called
*NL*
interested
,
elation
remained
rather
vague
.
Strether
might
easily
have
*NL*
made
out
that
she
had
been
asking
herself
,
in
the
hours
she
had
just
*NL*
sat
through
,
if
there
were
still
for
her
,
or
were
only
not
,
a
fair
*NL*
shade
of
uncertainty
.
Let
us
hasten
to
add
,
however
,
that
what
he
at
*NL*
first
made
out
on
this
occasion
he
also
at
first
kept
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
only
asked
what
in
particular
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
come
for
,
and
as
to
*NL*
this
his
companion
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wants
tidings
of
Mr.
Newsome
,
whom
she
appears
not
to
have
seen
*NL*
for
some
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
has
n't
been
away
with
him
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seemed
to
think
,
''
Maria
answered
,
``
that
he
might
have
gone
away
*NL*
with
YOU
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
tell
her
I
know
nothing
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
indulgent
headshake
.
``
I
've
known
nothing
of
what
you
know
.
*NL*
I
could
only
tell
her
I
'd
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
've
not
seen
him
for
a
week
--
and
of
course
I
've
wondered
.
''
His
*NL*
wonderment
showed
at
this
moment
as
sharper
,
but
he
presently
went
on
.
*NL*
``
Still
,
I
dare
say
I
can
put
my
hand
on
him
.
Did
she
strike
you
,
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
``
as
anxious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
always
anxious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
I
've
done
for
her
?
''
And
he
had
one
of
the
last
flickers
of
*NL*
his
occasional
mild
mirth
.
``
To
think
that
was
just
what
I
came
out
to
*NL*
prevent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
up
but
to
reply
.
``
You
do
n't
regard
him
then
as
safe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
to
ask
you
how
in
that
respect
you
regard
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
a
little
.
``
What
woman
was
EVER
safe
?
She
told
me
,
''
*NL*
she
added
--
and
it
was
as
if
at
the
touch
of
the
connexion
--
``
of
your
*NL*
extraordinary
meeting
in
the
country
.
After
that
a
quoi
se
fier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
as
an
accident
,
in
all
the
possible
or
impossible
chapter
,
''
*NL*
Strether
conceded
,
``
amazing
enough
.
But
still
,
but
still
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
she
did
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
mind
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
as
you
do
n't
either
,
we
may
all
sink
to
rest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
appeared
to
agree
with
her
,
but
he
had
his
reservation
.
``
I
do
mind
*NL*
Chad
's
disappearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
'll
get
him
back
.
But
now
you
know
,
''
she
said
,
``
why
I
went
to
*NL*
Mentone
.
''
He
had
sufficiently
let
her
see
that
he
had
by
this
time
*NL*
gathered
things
together
,
but
there
was
nature
in
her
wish
to
make
them
*NL*
clearer
still
.
``
I
did
n't
want
you
to
put
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
put
it
to
you
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
of
what
you
were
at
last
--
a
week
ago
--
to
see
for
*NL*
yourself
.
I
did
n't
want
to
have
to
lie
for
her
.
I
felt
that
to
be
too
*NL*
much
for
me
.
A
man
of
course
is
always
expected
to
do
it
--
to
do
it
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
for
a
woman
;
but
not
a
woman
for
another
woman
;
unless
perhaps
on
*NL*
the
tit-for-tat
principle
,
as
an
indirect
way
of
protecting
herself
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
need
protection
,
so
that
I
was
free
to
`
funk
'
you
--
simply
to
*NL*
dodge
your
test
.
The
responsibility
was
too
much
for
me
.
I
gained
*NL*
time
,
and
when
I
came
back
the
need
of
a
test
had
blown
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
thought
of
it
serenely
.
``
Yes
;
when
you
came
back
little
*NL*
Bilham
had
shown
me
what
's
expected
of
a
gentleman
.
Little
Bilham
had
*NL*
lied
like
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
like
what
you
believed
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
it
was
but
a
technical
lie
--
he
classed
the
*NL*
attachment
as
virtuous
.
That
was
a
view
for
which
there
was
much
to
be
*NL*
said
--
and
the
virtue
came
out
for
me
hugely
There
was
of
course
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
it
.
I
got
it
full
in
the
face
,
and
I
have
n't
,
you
see
,
done
*NL*
with
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
see
,
what
I
saw
,
''
Maria
returned
,
``
is
that
you
dressed
up
even
*NL*
the
virtue
.
You
were
wonderful
--
you
were
beautiful
,
as
I
've
had
the
*NL*
honour
of
telling
you
before
;
but
,
if
you
wish
really
to
know
,
''
she
*NL*
sadly
confessed
,
``
I
never
quite
knew
WHERE
you
were
.
There
were
*NL*
moments
,
''
she
explained
,
``
when
you
struck
me
as
grandly
cynical
;
there
*NL*
were
others
when
you
struck
me
as
grandly
vague
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friend
considered
.
``
I
had
phases
.
I
had
flights
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
things
must
have
a
basis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
basis
seemed
to
me
just
what
her
beauty
supplied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
beauty
of
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
her
beauty
of
everything
.
The
impression
she
makes
.
She
has
*NL*
such
variety
and
yet
such
harmony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
considered
him
with
one
of
her
deep
returns
of
indulgence
--
returns
*NL*
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
irritations
they
flooded
over
.
``
You
're
*NL*
complete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
always
too
personal
,
''
he
good-humouredly
said
;
``
but
that
's
*NL*
precisely
how
I
wondered
and
wandered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
mean
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
that
she
was
from
the
first
for
you
the
*NL*
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
,
nothing
's
more
simple
.
Only
that
was
*NL*
an
odd
foundation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
I
reared
on
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
you
did
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
all
not
a
fixed
quantity
.
And
it
had
for
me
--
it
has
*NL*
still
--
such
elements
of
strangeness
.
Her
greater
age
than
his
,
her
*NL*
different
world
,
traditions
,
association
;
her
other
opportunities
,
*NL*
liabilities
,
standards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
listened
with
respect
to
his
enumeration
of
these
*NL*
disparities
;
then
she
disposed
of
them
at
a
stroke
.
``
Those
things
are
*NL*
nothing
when
a
woman
's
hit
.
It
's
very
awful
.
She
was
hit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
,
on
his
side
,
did
justice
to
that
plea
.
``
Oh
of
course
I
saw
*NL*
she
was
hit
.
That
she
was
hit
was
what
we
were
busy
with
;
that
she
was
*NL*
hit
was
our
great
affair
.
But
somehow
I
could
n't
think
of
her
as
down
*NL*
in
the
dust
.
And
as
put
there
by
OUR
little
Chad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
was
n't
`
your
'
little
Chad
just
your
miracle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
admitted
it
.
``
Of
course
I
moved
among
miracles
.
It
was
all
*NL*
phantasmagoric
.
But
the
great
fact
was
that
so
much
of
it
was
none
of
*NL*
my
business
--
as
I
saw
my
business
.
It
is
n't
even
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
companion
turned
away
on
this
,
and
it
might
well
have
been
yet
*NL*
again
with
the
sharpness
of
a
fear
of
how
little
his
philosophy
could
*NL*
bring
her
personally
.
``
I
wish
SHE
could
hear
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Newsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
Mrs.
Newsome
;
since
I
understand
you
that
it
does
n't
matter
*NL*
now
what
Mrs.
Newsome
hears
.
Has
n't
she
heard
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Practically
--
yes
.
''
He
had
thought
a
moment
,
but
he
went
on
.
``
You
wish
*NL*
Madame
de
Vionnet
could
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
''
She
had
come
back
to
him
.
``
She
thinks
just
the
*NL*
contrary
of
what
you
say
.
That
you
distinctly
judge
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
over
the
scene
as
the
two
women
thus
placed
together
for
him
*NL*
seemed
to
give
it
.
``
She
might
have
known
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
have
known
you
do
n't
?
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
as
he
let
it
drop
.
*NL*
``
She
was
sure
of
it
at
first
,
''
she
pursued
as
he
said
nothing
;
``
she
*NL*
took
it
for
granted
,
at
least
,
as
any
woman
in
her
position
would
.
But
*NL*
after
that
she
changed
her
mind
;
she
believed
you
believed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
--
he
was
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
in
her
sublimity
.
And
that
belief
had
remained
with
her
,
I
make
*NL*
out
,
till
the
accident
of
the
other
day
opened
your
eyes
.
For
that
it
*NL*
did
,
''
said
Maria
,
``
open
them
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
help
''
--
he
had
taken
it
up
--
``
being
aware
?
No
,
''
he
mused
;
``
I
*NL*
suppose
she
thinks
of
that
even
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
WERE
closed
?
There
you
are
!
However
,
if
you
see
her
as
the
*NL*
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
And
if
*NL*
you
'd
like
me
to
tell
her
that
you
do
still
so
see
her

!
''
Miss
*NL*
Gostrey
,
in
short
,
offered
herself
for
service
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
offer
he
could
temporarily
entertain
;
but
he
decided
.
``
She
*NL*
knows
perfectly
how
I
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
favourably
enough
,
she
mentioned
to
me
,
to
wish
ever
to
see
her
*NL*
again
.
She
told
me
you
had
taken
a
final
leave
of
her
.
She
says
*NL*
you
've
done
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
had
a
pause
;
then
she
spoke
as
if
for
conscience
.
``
She
would
n't
*NL*
have
done
with
YOU
.
She
feels
she
has
lost
you
--
yet
that
she
might
*NL*
have
been
better
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
she
has
been
quite
good
enough
!
''
Strether
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thinks
you
and
she
might
at
any
rate
have
been
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
certainly
.
That
's
just
''
--
he
continued
to
laugh
--
``
why
I
'm
*NL*
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
if
Maria
could
feel
with
this
then
at
last
that
she
had
done
*NL*
her
best
for
each
.
But
she
had
still
an
idea
.
``
Shall
I
tell
her
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Tell
her
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
.
''
To
which
in
the
next
breath
Miss
Gostrey
added
:
``
Poor
*NL*
dear
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
friend
wondered
;
then
with
raised
eyebrows
:
``
Me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
.
Marie
de
Vionnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
accepted
the
correction
,
but
he
wondered
still
.
``
Are
you
so
sorry
*NL*
for
her
as
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
think
a
moment
--
made
her
even
speak
with
a
smile
.
But
she
*NL*
did
n't
really
retract
.
``
I
'm
sorry
for
us
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
to
delay
no
longer
to
re-establish
communication
with
Chad
,
and
*NL*
we
have
just
seen
that
he
had
spoken
to
Miss
Gostrey
of
this
intention
*NL*
on
hearing
from
her
of
the
young
man
's
absence
.
It
was
not
moreover
*NL*
only
the
assurance
so
given
that
prompted
him
;
it
was
the
need
of
*NL*
causing
his
conduct
to
square
with
another
profession
still
--
the
motive
*NL*
he
had
described
to
her
as
his
sharpest
for
now
getting
away
.
If
he
*NL*
was
to
get
away
because
of
some
of
the
relations
involved
in
staying
,
*NL*
the
cold
attitude
toward
them
might
look
pedantic
in
the
light
of
*NL*
lingering
on
.
He
must
do
both
things
;
he
must
see
Chad
,
but
he
must
*NL*
go
.
The
more
he
thought
of
the
former
of
these
duties
the
more
he
felt
*NL*
himself
make
a
subject
of
insistence
of
the
latter
.
They
were
alike
*NL*
intensely
present
to
him
as
he
sat
in
front
of
a
quiet
little
cafe
into
*NL*
which
he
had
dropped
on
quitting
Maria
's
entresol
.
The
rain
that
had
*NL*
spoiled
his
evening
with
her
was
over
;
for
it
was
still
to
him
as
if
*NL*
his
evening
HAD
been
spoiled
--
though
it
might
n't
have
been
wholly
the
*NL*
rain
.
It
was
late
when
he
left
the
cafe
,
yet
not
too
late
;
he
could
n't
*NL*
in
any
case
go
straight
to
bed
,
and
he
would
walk
round
by
the
*NL*
Boulevard
Malesherbes
--
rather
far
round
--
on
his
way
home
.
Present
*NL*
enough
always
was
the
small
circumstance
that
had
originally
pressed
*NL*
for
him
the
spring
of
so
big
a
difference
--
the
accident
of
little
*NL*
Bilham
's
appearance
on
the
balcony
of
the
mystic
troisieme
at
the
*NL*
moment
of
his
first
visit
,
and
the
effect
of
it
on
his
sense
of
what
*NL*
was
then
before
him
.
He
recalled
his
watch
,
his
wait
,
and
the
*NL*
recognition
that
had
proceeded
from
the
young
stranger
,
that
had
played
*NL*
frankly
into
the
air
and
had
presently
brought
him
up
--
things
smoothing
*NL*
the
way
for
his
first
straight
step
.
He
had
since
had
occasion
,
a
few
*NL*
times
,
to
pass
the
house
without
going
in
;
but
he
had
never
passed
it
*NL*
without
again
feeling
how
it
had
then
spoken
to
him
.
He
stopped
short
*NL*
to-night
on
coming
to
sight
of
it
:
it
was
as
if
his
last
day
were
*NL*
oddly
copying
his
first
.
The
windows
of
Chad
's
apartment
were
open
to
*NL*
the
balcony
--
a
pair
of
them
lighted
;
and
a
figure
that
had
come
out
and
*NL*
taken
up
little
Bilham
's
attitude
,
a
figure
whose
cigarette-spark
he
*NL*
could
see
leaned
on
the
rail
and
looked
down
at
him
.
It
denoted
*NL*
however
no
reappearance
of
his
younger
friend
;
it
quickly
defined
*NL*
itself
in
the
tempered
darkness
as
Chad
's
more
solid
shape
;
so
that
*NL*
Chad
's
was
the
attention
that
after
he
had
stepped
forward
into
the
*NL*
street
and
signalled
,
he
easily
engaged
;
Chad
's
was
the
voice
that
,
*NL*
sounding
into
the
night
with
promptness
and
seemingly
with
joy
,
greeted
*NL*
him
and
called
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
young
man
had
been
visible
there
just
in
this
position
*NL*
expressed
somehow
for
Strether
that
,
as
Maria
Gostrey
had
reported
,
he
*NL*
had
been
absent
and
silent
;
and
our
friend
drew
breath
on
each
*NL*
landing
--
the
lift
,
at
that
hour
,
having
ceased
to
work
--
before
the
*NL*
implications
of
the
fact
.
He
had
been
for
a
week
intensely
away
,
away
*NL*
to
a
distance
and
alone
;
but
he
was
more
back
than
ever
,
and
the
*NL*
attitude
in
which
Strether
had
surprised
him
was
something
more
than
a
*NL*
return
--
it
was
clearly
a
conscious
surrender
.
He
had
arrived
but
an
*NL*
hour
before
,
from
London
,
from
Lucerne
,
from
Homburg
,
from
no
matter
*NL*
where
--
though
the
visitor
's
fancy
,
on
the
staircase
,
liked
to
fill
it
*NL*
out
;
and
after
a
bath
,
a
talk
with
Baptiste
and
a
supper
of
light
cold
*NL*
clever
French
things
,
which
one
could
see
the
remains
of
there
in
the
*NL*
circle
of
the
lamp
,
pretty
and
ultra-Parisian
,
he
had
come
into
the
air
*NL*
again
for
a
smoke
,
was
occupied
at
the
moment
of
Strether
's
approach
in
*NL*
what
might
have
been
called
taking
up
his
life
afresh
.
His
life
,
his
*NL*
life
!
--
Strether
paused
anew
,
on
the
last
flight
,
at
this
final
rather
*NL*
breathless
sense
of
what
Chad
's
life
was
doing
with
Chad
's
mother
's
*NL*
emissary
.
It
was
dragging
him
,
at
strange
hours
,
up
the
staircases
of
*NL*
the
rich
;
it
was
keeping
him
out
of
bed
at
the
end
of
long
hot
days
;
it
*NL*
was
transforming
beyond
recognition
the
simple
,
subtle
,
conveniently
*NL*
uniform
thing
that
had
anciently
passed
with
him
for
a
life
of
his
own
.
*NL*
Why
should
it
concern
him
that
Chad
was
to
be
fortified
in
the
pleasant
*NL*
practice
of
smoking
on
balconies
,
of
supping
on
salads
,
of
feeling
his
*NL*
special
conditions
agreeably
reaffirm
themselves
,
of
finding
*NL*
reassurance
in
comparisons
and
contrasts
?
There
was
no
answer
to
such
*NL*
a
question
but
that
he
was
still
practically
committed
--
he
had
perhaps
*NL*
never
yet
so
much
known
it
.
It
made
him
feel
old
,
and
he
would
buy
his
*NL*
railway-ticket
--
feeling
,
no
doubt
,
older
--
the
next
day
;
but
he
had
*NL*
meanwhile
come
up
four
flights
,
counting
the
entresol
,
at
midnight
and
*NL*
without
a
lift
,
for
Chad
's
life
.
The
young
man
,
hearing
him
by
this
*NL*
time
,
and
with
Baptiste
sent
to
rest
,
was
already
at
the
door
;
so
that
*NL*
Strether
had
before
him
in
full
visibility
the
cause
in
which
he
was
*NL*
labouring
and
even
,
with
the
troisieme
fairly
gained
,
panting
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
offered
him
,
as
always
,
a
welcome
in
which
the
cordial
and
the
*NL*
formal
--
so
far
as
the
formal
was
the
respectful
--
handsomely
met
;
and
*NL*
after
he
had
expressed
a
hope
that
he
would
let
him
put
him
up
for
the
*NL*
night
Strether
was
in
full
possession
of
the
key
,
as
it
might
have
been
*NL*
called
,
to
what
had
lately
happened
.
If
he
had
just
thought
of
himself
*NL*
as
old
Chad
was
at
sight
of
him
thinking
of
him
as
older
:
he
wanted
to
*NL*
put
him
up
for
the
night
just
because
he
was
ancient
and
weary
.
It
*NL*
could
never
be
said
the
tenant
of
these
quarters
was
n't
nice
to
him
;
a
*NL*
tenant
who
,
if
he
might
indeed
now
keep
him
,
was
probably
prepared
to
*NL*
work
it
all
still
more
thoroughly
.
Our
friend
had
in
fact
the
*NL*
impression
that
with
the
minimum
of
encouragement
Chad
would
propose
to
*NL*
keep
him
indefinitely
;
an
impression
in
the
lap
of
which
one
of
his
own
*NL*
possibilities
seemed
to
sit
.
Madame
de
Vionnet
had
wished
him
to
*NL*
stay
--
so
why
did
n't
that
happily
fit
?
He
could
enshrine
himself
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
days
in
his
young
host
's
chambre
d'ami
and
draw
out
*NL*
these
days
at
his
young
host
's
expense
:
there
could
scarce
be
greater
*NL*
logical
expression
of
the
countenance
he
had
been
moved
to
give
.
There
*NL*
was
literally
a
minute
--
it
was
strange
enough
--
during
which
he
grasped
*NL*
the
idea
that
as
he
WAS
acting
,
as
he
could
only
act
,
he
was
*NL*
inconsistent
.
The
sign
that
the
inward
forces
he
had
obeyed
really
*NL*
hung
together
would
be
that
--
in
default
always
of
another
career
--
he
*NL*
should
promote
the
good
cause
by
mounting
guard
on
it
.
These
things
,
*NL*
during
his
first
minutes
,
came
and
went
;
but
they
were
after
all
*NL*
practically
disposed
of
as
soon
as
he
had
mentioned
his
errand
.
He
had
*NL*
come
to
say
good-bye
--
yet
that
was
only
a
part
;
so
that
from
the
moment
*NL*
Chad
accepted
his
farewell
the
question
of
a
more
ideal
affirmation
*NL*
gave
way
to
something
else
.
He
proceeded
with
the
rest
of
his
business
.
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
a
brute
,
you
know
--
you
'll
be
guilty
of
the
last
infamy
--
if
*NL*
you
ever
forsake
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
,
uttered
there
at
the
solemn
hour
,
uttered
in
the
place
that
was
*NL*
full
of
her
influence
,
was
the
rest
of
his
business
;
and
when
once
he
*NL*
had
heard
himself
say
it
he
felt
that
his
message
had
never
before
been
*NL*
spoken
.
It
placed
his
present
call
immediately
on
solid
ground
,
and
*NL*
the
effect
of
it
was
to
enable
him
quite
to
play
with
what
we
have
*NL*
called
the
key
.
Chad
showed
no
shade
of
embarrassment
,
but
had
none
*NL*
the
less
been
troubled
for
him
after
their
meeting
in
the
country
;
had
*NL*
had
fears
and
doubts
on
the
subject
of
his
comfort
.
He
was
disturbed
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
only
FOR
him
,
and
had
positively
gone
away
to
ease
him
off
,
*NL*
to
let
him
down
--
if
it
was
n't
indeed
rather
to
screw
him
up
--
the
more
*NL*
gently
.
Seeing
him
now
fairly
jaded
he
had
come
,
with
characteristic
*NL*
good
humour
,
all
the
way
to
meet
him
,
and
what
Strether
thereupon
*NL*
supremely
made
out
was
that
he
would
abound
for
him
to
the
end
in
*NL*
conscientious
assurances
.
This
was
what
was
between
them
while
the
*NL*
visitor
remained
;
so
far
from
having
to
go
over
old
ground
he
found
his
*NL*
entertainer
keen
to
agree
to
everything
.
It
could
n't
be
put
too
*NL*
strongly
for
him
that
he
'd
be
a
brute
.
``
Oh
rather
!
--
if
I
should
do
*NL*
anything
of
THAT
sort
.
I
hope
you
believe
I
really
feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
it
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
to
be
my
last
word
of
all
to
you
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
say
more
,
you
know
;
and
I
do
n't
see
how
I
can
do
more
,
in
every
way
,
*NL*
than
I
've
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
took
this
,
almost
artlessly
,
as
a
direct
allusion
.
``
You
've
seen
*NL*
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
to
say
good-bye
.
And
if
I
had
doubted
the
truth
of
what
I
*NL*
tell
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
have
cleared
up
your
doubt
?
''
Chad
understood
--
``
rather
''
--
again
!
*NL*
It
even
kept
him
briefly
silent
.
But
he
made
that
up
.
``
She
must
have
*NL*
been
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
WAS
,
''
Strether
candidly
admitted
--
all
of
which
practically
told
as
*NL*
a
reference
to
the
conditions
created
by
the
accident
of
the
previous
*NL*
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
appeared
for
a
little
to
be
looking
back
at
it
;
and
that
came
out
*NL*
still
more
in
what
Chad
next
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
've
really
*NL*
thought
,
all
along
;
I
never
did
know
--
for
anything
,
with
you
,
seemed
to
*NL*
be
possible
.
But
of
course
--
of
course
--
''
Without
confusion
,
quite
*NL*
with
nothing
but
indulgence
,
he
broke
down
,
he
pulled
up
.
``
After
all
,
*NL*
you
understand
.
I
spoke
to
you
originally
only
as
I
HAD
to
speak
.
*NL*
There
's
only
one
way
--
is
n't
there
?
--
about
such
things
.
However
,
''
he
*NL*
smiled
with
a
final
philosophy
,
``
I
see
it
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
met
his
eyes
with
a
sense
of
multiplying
thoughts
.
What
was
*NL*
it
that
made
him
at
present
,
late
at
night
and
after
journeys
,
so
*NL*
renewedly
,
so
substantially
young
?
Strether
saw
in
a
moment
what
it
*NL*
was
--
it
was
that
he
was
younger
again
than
Madame
de
Vionnet
.
He
*NL*
himself
said
immediately
none
of
the
things
that
he
was
thinking
;
he
*NL*
said
something
quite
different
.
``
You
HAVE
really
been
to
a
distance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
to
England
.
''
Chad
spoke
cheerfully
and
promptly
,
but
gave
no
*NL*
further
account
of
it
than
to
say
:
``
One
must
sometimes
get
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
wanted
no
more
facts
--
he
only
wanted
to
justify
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
his
question
.
``
Of
course
you
do
as
you
're
free
to
do
.
But
I
hope
,
*NL*
this
time
,
that
you
did
n't
go
for
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
very
shame
at
bothering
you
really
too
much
?
My
dear
man
,
''
Chad
*NL*
laughed
,
``
what
WOULD
n't
I
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
's
easy
answer
for
this
was
that
it
was
a
disposition
he
had
*NL*
exactly
come
to
profit
by
.
``
Even
at
the
risk
of
being
in
your
way
I
've
*NL*
waited
on
,
you
know
,
for
a
definite
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
took
it
in
.
``
Oh
yes
--
for
us
to
make
if
possible
a
still
better
*NL*
impression
.
''
And
he
stood
there
happily
exhaling
his
full
general
*NL*
consciousness
.
``
I
'm
delighted
to
gather
that
you
feel
we
've
made
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pleasant
irony
in
the
words
,
which
his
guest
,
preoccupied
*NL*
and
keeping
to
the
point
,
did
n't
take
up
.
``
If
I
had
my
sense
of
*NL*
wanting
the
rest
of
the
time
--
the
time
of
their
being
still
on
this
*NL*
side
,
''
he
continued
to
explain
--
``
I
know
now
why
I
wanted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
as
grave
,
as
distinct
,
as
a
demonstrator
before
a
blackboard
,
*NL*
and
Chad
continued
to
face
him
like
an
intelligent
pupil
.
``
You
wanted
*NL*
to
have
been
put
through
the
whole
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
again
,
for
a
moment
,
said
nothing
;
he
turned
his
eyes
away
,
*NL*
and
they
lost
themselves
,
through
the
open
window
,
in
the
dusky
outer
*NL*
air
.
``
I
shall
learn
from
the
Bank
here
where
they
're
now
having
their
*NL*
letters
,
and
my
last
word
,
which
I
shall
write
in
the
morning
and
which
*NL*
they
're
expecting
as
my
ultimatum
,
will
so
immediately
reach
them
.
''
The
*NL*
light
of
his
plural
pronoun
was
sufficiently
reflected
in
his
*NL*
companion
's
face
as
he
again
met
it
;
and
he
completed
his
*NL*
demonstration
.
He
pursued
indeed
as
if
for
himself
.
``
Of
course
I
've
*NL*
first
to
justify
what
I
shall
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
justifying
it
beautifully
!
''
Chad
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
question
of
advising
you
not
to
go
,
''
Strether
said
,
``
but
of
*NL*
absolutely
preventing
you
,
if
possible
,
from
so
much
as
thinking
of
it
.
*NL*
Let
me
accordingly
appeal
to
you
by
all
you
hold
sacred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
showed
a
surprise
.
``
What
makes
you
think
me
capable
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
not
only
be
,
as
I
say
,
a
brute
;
you
'd
be
,
''
his
companion
went
on
*NL*
in
the
same
way
,
``
a
criminal
of
the
deepest
dye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
gave
a
sharper
look
,
as
if
to
gauge
a
possible
suspicion
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
should
make
you
think
I
'm
tired
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
did
n't
quite
know
either
,
and
such
impressions
,
for
the
*NL*
imaginative
mind
,
were
always
too
fine
,
too
floating
,
to
produce
on
the
*NL*
spot
their
warrant
.
There
was
none
the
less
for
him
,
in
the
very
*NL*
manner
of
his
host
's
allusion
to
satiety
as
a
thinkable
motive
,
a
*NL*
slight
breath
of
the
ominous
.
``
I
feel
how
much
more
she
can
do
for
*NL*
you
.
She
has
n't
done
it
all
yet
.
Stay
with
her
at
least
till
she
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
leave
her
THEN
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
kept
smiling
,
but
its
effect
in
Strether
was
a
shade
of
*NL*
dryness
.
``
Do
n't
leave
her
BEFORE
.
When
you
've
got
all
that
can
be
*NL*
got
--
I
do
n't
say
,
''
he
added
a
trifle
grimly
.
``
That
will
be
the
proper
*NL*
time
.
But
as
,
for
you
,
from
such
a
woman
,
there
will
always
be
*NL*
something
to
be
got
,
my
remark
's
not
a
wrong
to
her
.
''
Chad
let
him
go
*NL*
on
,
showing
every
decent
deference
,
showing
perhaps
also
a
candid
*NL*
curiosity
for
this
sharper
accent
.
``
I
remember
you
,
you
know
,
as
you
*NL*
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
awful
ass
,
was
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
response
was
as
prompt
as
if
he
had
pressed
a
spring
;
it
had
a
*NL*
ready
abundance
at
which
he
even
winced
;
so
that
he
took
a
moment
to
*NL*
meet
it
.
``
You
certainly
then
would
n't
have
seemed
worth
all
you
've
let
*NL*
me
in
for
.
You
've
defined
yourself
better
.
Your
value
has
quintupled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
would
n't
that
be
enough
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
risked
it
jocosely
,
but
Strether
remained
blank
.
``
Enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
SHOULD
wish
to
live
on
one
's
accumulations
?
''
After
which
,
*NL*
however
,
as
his
friend
appeared
cold
to
the
joke
,
the
young
man
as
*NL*
easily
dropped
it
.
``
Of
course
I
really
never
forget
,
night
or
day
,
*NL*
what
I
owe
her
.
I
owe
her
everything
.
I
give
you
my
word
of
honour
,
''
*NL*
he
frankly
rang
out
,
``
that
I
'm
not
a
bit
tired
of
her
.
''
Strether
at
*NL*
this
only
gave
him
a
stare
:
the
way
youth
could
express
itself
was
*NL*
again
and
again
a
wonder
.
He
meant
no
harm
,
though
he
might
after
all
*NL*
be
capable
of
much
;
yet
he
spoke
of
being
``
tired
''
of
her
almost
as
he
*NL*
might
have
spoken
of
being
tired
of
roast
mutton
for
dinner
.
``
She
has
*NL*
never
for
a
moment
yet
bored
me
--
never
been
wanting
,
as
the
cleverest
*NL*
women
sometimes
are
,
in
tact
.
She
has
never
talked
about
her
tact
--
as
*NL*
even
they
too
sometimes
talk
;
but
she
has
always
had
it
.
She
has
never
*NL*
had
it
more
''
--
he
handsomely
made
the
point
--
``
than
just
lately
.
''
And
he
*NL*
scrupulously
went
further
.
``
She
has
never
been
anything
I
could
call
a
*NL*
burden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
for
a
moment
said
nothing
;
then
he
spoke
gravely
,
with
his
*NL*
shade
of
dryness
deepened
.
``
Oh
if
you
did
n't
do
her
justice
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
SHOULD
be
a
beast
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
devoted
no
time
to
saying
what
he
would
be
;
THAT
,
visibly
,
*NL*
would
take
them
far
.
If
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
repeat
,
*NL*
however
,
repetition
was
no
mistake
.
``
You
owe
her
everything
--
very
much
*NL*
more
than
she
can
ever
owe
you
.
You
've
in
other
words
duties
to
her
,
*NL*
of
the
most
positive
sort
;
and
I
do
n't
see
what
other
duties
--
as
the
*NL*
others
are
presented
to
you
--
can
be
held
to
go
before
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
.
``
And
you
know
of
course
about
the
*NL*
others
,
eh
?
--
since
it
's
you
yourself
who
have
done
the
presenting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
of
it
--
yes
--
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
.
But
not
all
--
from
the
*NL*
moment
your
sister
took
my
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
,
''
Chad
returned
.
``
Sally
took
a
place
,
certainly
;
but
it
*NL*
was
never
,
I
saw
from
the
first
moment
,
to
be
yours
.
No
one
--
with
*NL*
us
--
will
ever
take
yours
.
It
would
n't
be
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
of
course
,
''
sighed
Strether
,
``
I
knew
it
.
I
believe
you
're
right
.
*NL*
No
one
in
the
world
,
I
imagine
,
was
ever
so
portentously
solemn
.
There
*NL*
I
am
,
''
he
added
with
another
sigh
,
as
if
weary
enough
,
on
occasion
,
of
*NL*
this
truth
.
``
I
was
made
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
appeared
for
a
little
to
consider
the
way
he
was
made
;
he
might
*NL*
for
this
purpose
have
measured
him
up
and
down
.
His
conclusion
favoured
*NL*
the
fact
.
``
YOU
have
never
needed
any
one
to
make
you
better
.
There
*NL*
has
never
been
any
one
good
enough
.
They
could
n't
,
''
the
young
man
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
hesitated
.
``
I
beg
your
pardon
.
They
HAVE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
showed
,
not
without
amusement
,
his
doubt
.
``
Who
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
--
though
a
little
dimly
--
smiled
at
him
.
``
Women
--
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Two
'
?
''
--
Chad
stared
and
laughed
.
``
Oh
I
do
n't
believe
,
for
such
work
,
*NL*
in
any
more
than
one
!
So
you
're
proving
too
much
.
And
what
IS
*NL*
beastly
,
at
all
events
,
''
he
added
,
``
is
losing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
set
himself
in
motion
for
departure
,
but
at
this
he
*NL*
paused
.
``
Are
you
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Afraid
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
doing
wrong
.
I
mean
away
from
my
eye
.
''
Before
Chad
could
speak
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
taken
himself
up
.
``
I
AM
,
certainly
,
''
he
laughed
,
*NL*
``
prodigious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
spoil
us
for
all
the
stupid
--
!
''
This
might
have
been
,
on
*NL*
Chad
's
part
,
in
its
extreme
emphasis
,
almost
too
freely
extravagant
;
*NL*
but
it
was
full
,
plainly
enough
,
of
the
intention
of
comfort
,
it
*NL*
carried
with
it
a
protest
against
doubt
and
a
promise
,
positively
,
of
*NL*
performance
.
Picking
up
a
hat
in
the
vestibule
he
came
out
with
his
*NL*
friend
,
came
downstairs
,
took
his
arm
,
affectionately
,
as
to
help
and
*NL*
guide
him
,
treating
him
if
not
exactly
as
aged
and
infirm
,
yet
as
a
*NL*
noble
eccentric
who
appealed
to
tenderness
,
and
keeping
on
with
him
,
*NL*
while
they
walked
,
to
the
next
corner
and
the
next
.
``
You
need
n't
tell
*NL*
me
,
you
need
n't
tell
me
!
''
--
this
again
as
they
proceeded
,
he
wished
to
*NL*
make
Strether
feel
.
What
he
need
n't
tell
him
was
now
at
last
,
in
the
*NL*
geniality
of
separation
,
anything
at
all
it
concerned
him
to
know
.
He
*NL*
knew
,
up
to
the
hilt
--
that
really
came
over
Chad
;
he
understood
,
felt
,
*NL*
recorded
his
vow
;
and
they
lingered
on
it
as
they
had
lingered
in
their
*NL*
walk
to
Strether
's
hotel
the
night
of
their
first
meeting
.
The
latter
*NL*
took
,
at
this
hour
,
all
he
could
get
;
he
had
given
all
he
had
had
to
*NL*
give
;
he
was
as
depleted
as
if
he
had
spent
his
last
sou
.
But
there
*NL*
was
just
one
thing
for
which
,
before
they
broke
off
,
Chad
seemed
*NL*
disposed
slightly
to
bargain
.
His
companion
need
n't
,
as
he
said
,
tell
*NL*
him
,
but
he
might
himself
mention
that
he
had
been
getting
some
news
of
*NL*
the
art
of
advertisement
.
He
came
out
quite
suddenly
with
this
*NL*
announcement
while
Strether
wondered
if
his
revived
interest
were
what
*NL*
had
taken
him
,
with
strange
inconsequence
,
over
to
London
.
He
appeared
*NL*
at
all
events
to
have
been
looking
into
the
question
and
had
*NL*
encountered
a
revelation
.
Advertising
scientifically
worked
presented
*NL*
itself
thus
as
the
great
new
force
.
``
It
really
does
the
thing
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
face
to
face
under
the
street-lamp
as
they
had
been
the
first
*NL*
night
,
and
Strether
,
no
doubt
,
looked
blank
.
``
Affects
,
you
mean
,
the
*NL*
sale
of
the
object
advertised
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
affects
it
extraordinarily
;
really
beyond
what
one
had
*NL*
supposed
.
I
mean
of
course
when
it
's
done
as
one
makes
out
that
in
our
*NL*
roaring
age
,
it
CAN
be
done
.
I
've
been
finding
out
a
little
,
though
it
*NL*
doubtless
does
n't
amount
to
much
more
than
what
you
originally
,
so
*NL*
awfully
vividly
--
and
all
,
very
nearly
,
that
first
night
--
put
before
me
.
*NL*
It
's
an
art
like
another
,
and
infinite
like
all
the
arts
.
''
He
went
on
*NL*
as
if
for
the
joke
of
it
--
almost
as
if
his
friend
's
face
amused
him
.
*NL*
``
In
the
hands
,
naturally
,
of
a
master
.
The
right
man
must
take
hold
.
*NL*
With
the
right
man
to
work
it
c'est
un
monde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
had
watched
him
quite
as
if
,
there
on
the
pavement
without
a
*NL*
pretext
,
he
had
begun
to
dance
a
fancy
step
.
``
Is
what
you
're
thinking
*NL*
of
that
you
yourself
,
in
the
case
you
have
in
mind
,
would
be
the
right
*NL*
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
had
thrown
back
his
light
coat
and
thrust
each
of
his
thumbs
into
*NL*
an
armhole
of
his
waistcoat
;
in
which
position
his
fingers
played
up
*NL*
and
down
.
``
Why
,
what
is
he
but
what
you
yourself
,
as
I
say
,
took
me
*NL*
for
when
you
first
came
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
felt
a
little
faint
,
but
he
coerced
his
attention
.
``
Oh
yes
,
*NL*
and
there
's
no
doubt
that
,
with
your
natural
parts
,
you
'd
have
much
in
*NL*
common
with
him
.
Advertising
is
clearly
at
this
time
of
day
the
secret
*NL*
of
trade
.
It
's
quite
possible
it
will
be
open
to
you
--
giving
the
whole
*NL*
of
your
mind
to
it
--
to
make
the
whole
place
hum
with
you
.
Your
*NL*
mother
's
appeal
is
to
the
whole
of
your
mind
,
and
that
's
exactly
the
*NL*
strength
of
her
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
's
fingers
continued
to
twiddle
,
but
he
had
something
of
a
drop
.
*NL*
``
Ah
we
've
been
through
my
mother
's
case
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
thought
.
Why
then
do
you
speak
of
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
because
it
was
part
of
our
original
discussion
.
To
wind
up
where
*NL*
we
began
,
my
interest
's
purely
platonic
.
There
at
any
rate
the
fact
*NL*
is
--
the
fact
of
the
possible
.
I
mean
the
money
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
damn
the
money
in
it
!
''
said
Strether
.
And
then
as
the
young
man
's
*NL*
fixed
smile
seemed
to
shine
out
more
strange
:
``
Shall
you
give
your
*NL*
friend
up
for
the
money
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chad
preserved
his
handsome
grimace
as
well
as
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
attitude
.
``
You
're
not
altogether
--
in
your
so
great
`
solemnity
'
--
kind
.
*NL*
Have
n't
I
been
drinking
you
in
--
showing
you
all
I
feel
you
're
worth
to
*NL*
me
?
What
have
I
done
,
what
am
I
doing
,
but
cleave
to
her
to
the
death
?
*NL*
The
only
thing
is
,
''
he
good-humouredly
explained
,
``
that
one
ca
n't
but
*NL*
have
it
before
one
,
in
the
cleaving
--
the
point
where
the
death
comes
*NL*
in
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
for
THAT
.
It
's
pleasant
to
a
fellow
's
feelings
,
''
*NL*
he
developed
,
``
to
`
size-up
'
the
bribe
he
applies
his
foot
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
then
if
all
you
want
's
a
kickable
surface
the
bribe
's
enormous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
Then
there
it
goes
!
''
Chad
administered
his
kick
with
fantastic
*NL*
force
and
sent
an
imaginary
object
flying
.
It
was
accordingly
as
if
*NL*
they
were
once
more
rid
of
the
question
and
could
come
back
to
what
*NL*
really
concerned
him
.
``
Of
course
I
shall
see
you
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Strether
scarce
heeded
the
plan
proposed
for
this
;
he
had
still
the
*NL*
impression
--
not
the
slighter
for
the
simulated
kick
--
of
an
irrelevant
*NL*
hornpipe
or
jig
.
``
You
're
restless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
returned
Chad
as
they
parted
,
``
you
're
exciting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
however
,
within
two
days
,
another
separation
to
face
.
He
had
*NL*
sent
Maria
Gostrey
a
word
early
,
by
hand
,
to
ask
if
he
might
come
to
*NL*
breakfast
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
at
noon
,
she
awaited
him
in
the
*NL*
cool
shade
of
her
little
Dutch-looking
dining-room
.
This
retreat
was
at
*NL*
the
back
of
the
house
,
with
a
view
of
a
scrap
of
old
garden
that
had
*NL*
been
saved
from
modern
ravage
;
and
though
he
had
on
more
than
one
other
*NL*
occasion
had
his
legs
under
its
small
and
peculiarly
polished
table
of
*NL*
hospitality
,
the
place
had
never
before
struck
him
as
so
sacred
to
*NL*
pleasant
knowledge
,
to
intimate
charm
,
to
antique
order
,
to
a
neatness
*NL*
that
was
almost
august
.
To
sit
there
was
,
as
he
had
told
his
hostess
*NL*
before
,
to
see
life
reflected
for
the
time
in
ideally
kept
pewter
;
*NL*
which
was
somehow
becoming
,
improving
to
life
,
so
that
one
's
eyes
were
*NL*
held
and
comforted
.
Strether
's
were
comforted
at
all
events
now
--
and
*NL*
the
more
that
it
was
the
last
time
--
with
the
charming
effect
,
on
the
*NL*
board
bare
of
a
cloth
and
proud
of
its
perfect
surface
,
of
the
small
*NL*
old
crockery
and
old
silver
,
matched
by
the
more
substantial
pieces
*NL*
happily
disposed
about
the
room
.
The
specimens
of
vivid
Delf
,
in
*NL*
particular
had
the
dignity
of
family
portraits
;
and
it
was
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
them
that
our
friend
resignedly
expressed
himself
.
He
spoke
even
*NL*
with
a
certain
philosophic
humour
.
``
There
's
nothing
more
to
wait
for
;
*NL*
I
seem
to
have
done
a
good
day
's
work
.
I
've
let
them
have
it
all
*NL*
round
.
I
've
seen
Chad
,
who
has
been
to
London
and
come
back
.
He
tells
*NL*
me
I
'm
`
exciting
,
'
and
I
seem
indeed
pretty
well
to
have
upset
every
*NL*
one
.
I
've
at
any
rate
excited
HIM
.
He
's
distinctly
restless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
excited
ME
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
smiled
.
``
I
'M
distinctly
restless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
were
that
when
I
found
you
.
It
seems
to
me
I
've
rather
got
you
*NL*
out
of
it
.
What
's
this
,
''
he
asked
as
he
looked
about
him
,
``
but
a
haunt
*NL*
of
ancient
peace
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
,
''
she
presently
replied
,
``
I
could
make
you
*NL*
treat
it
as
a
haven
of
rest
.
''
On
which
they
fronted
each
other
,
across
*NL*
the
table
,
as
if
things
unuttered
were
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
seemed
,
in
his
way
,
when
he
next
spoke
,
to
take
some
of
them
*NL*
up
.
``
It
would
n't
give
me
--
that
would
be
the
trouble
--
what
it
will
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
still
give
you
.
I
'm
not
,
''
he
explained
,
leaning
back
in
his
*NL*
chair
,
but
with
his
eyes
on
a
small
ripe
round
melon
--
``
in
real
harmony
*NL*
with
what
surrounds
me
.
You
ARE
.
I
take
it
too
hard
.
You
DO
N'T
.
It
*NL*
makes
--
that
's
what
it
comes
to
in
the
end
--
a
fool
of
me
.
''
Then
at
a
*NL*
tangent
,
``
What
has
he
been
doing
in
London
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
one
may
go
to
London
,
''
Maria
laughed
.
``
You
know
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
--
he
took
the
reminder
.
``
And
you
brought
ME
back
.
''
He
brooded
there
*NL*
opposite
to
her
,
but
without
gloom
.
``
Whom
has
Chad
brought
?
He
's
full
*NL*
of
ideas
.
And
I
wrote
to
Sarah
,
''
he
added
,
``
the
first
thing
this
*NL*
morning
.
So
I
'm
square
.
I
'm
ready
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
neglected
certain
parts
of
this
speech
in
the
interest
of
others
.
*NL*
``
Marie
said
to
me
the
other
day
that
she
felt
him
to
have
the
makings
*NL*
of
an
immense
man
of
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
.
He
's
the
son
of
his
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
SUCH
a
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
just
the
right
one
from
that
point
of
view
!
But
it
is
n't
his
*NL*
father
in
him
,
''
Strether
added
,
``
that
troubles
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
then
?
''
He
came
back
to
his
breakfast
;
he
partook
presently
*NL*
of
the
charming
melon
,
which
she
liberally
cut
for
him
;
and
it
was
only
*NL*
after
this
that
he
met
her
question
.
Then
moreover
it
was
but
to
*NL*
remark
that
he
'd
answer
her
presently
.
She
waited
,
she
watched
,
she
*NL*
served
him
and
amused
him
,
and
it
was
perhaps
with
this
last
idea
that
*NL*
she
soon
reminded
him
of
his
having
never
even
yet
named
to
her
the
*NL*
article
produced
at
Woollett
.
``
Do
you
remember
our
talking
of
it
in
*NL*
London
--
that
night
at
the
play
?
''
Before
he
could
say
yes
,
however
,
she
*NL*
had
put
it
to
him
for
other
matters
.
Did
he
remember
,
did
he
*NL*
remember
--
this
and
that
of
their
first
days
?
He
remembered
everything
,
*NL*
bringing
up
with
humour
even
things
of
which
she
professed
no
*NL*
recollection
,
things
she
vehemently
denied
;
and
falling
back
above
all
*NL*
on
the
great
interest
of
their
early
time
,
the
curiosity
felt
by
both
*NL*
of
them
as
to
where
he
would
``
come
out
.
''
They
had
so
assumed
it
was
to
*NL*
be
in
some
wonderful
place
--
they
had
thought
of
it
as
so
very
MUCH
out
.
*NL*
Well
,
that
was
doubtless
what
it
had
been
--
since
he
had
come
out
just
*NL*
there
.
He
was
out
,
in
truth
,
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
be
,
and
must
*NL*
now
rather
bethink
himself
of
getting
in
again
.
He
found
on
the
spot
*NL*
the
image
of
his
recent
history
;
he
was
like
one
of
the
figures
of
the
*NL*
old
clock
at
Berne
.
THEY
came
out
,
on
one
side
,
at
their
hour
,
jigged
*NL*
along
their
little
course
in
the
public
eye
,
and
went
in
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
He
too
had
jigged
his
little
course
--
him
too
a
modest
retreat
*NL*
awaited
.
He
offered
now
,
should
she
really
like
to
know
,
to
name
the
*NL*
great
product
of
Woollett
.
It
would
be
a
great
commentary
on
*NL*
everything
.
At
this
she
stopped
him
off
;
she
not
only
had
no
wish
to
*NL*
know
,
but
she
would
n't
know
for
the
world
.
She
had
done
with
the
*NL*
products
of
Woollett
--
for
all
the
good
she
had
got
from
them
.
She
*NL*
desired
no
further
news
of
them
,
and
she
mentioned
that
Madame
de
*NL*
Vionnet
herself
had
,
to
her
knowledge
,
lived
exempt
from
the
*NL*
information
he
was
ready
to
supply
.
She
had
never
consented
to
receive
*NL*
it
,
though
she
would
have
taken
it
,
under
stress
,
from
Mrs.
Pocock
.
But
*NL*
it
was
a
matter
about
which
Mrs.
Pocock
appeared
to
have
had
little
to
*NL*
say
--
never
sounding
the
word
--
and
it
did
n't
signify
now
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
clearly
for
Maria
Gostrey
that
signified
now
--
save
one
sharp
*NL*
point
,
that
is
,
to
which
she
came
in
time
.
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
's
*NL*
before
you
as
a
possibility
that
,
left
to
himself
,
Mr.
Chad
may
after
*NL*
all
go
back
.
I
judge
that
it
IS
more
or
less
so
before
you
,
from
what
*NL*
you
just
now
said
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
guest
had
his
eyes
on
her
,
kindly
but
attentively
,
as
if
foreseeing
*NL*
what
was
to
follow
this
.
``
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
for
the
money
.
''
And
*NL*
then
as
she
seemed
uncertain
:
``
I
mean
I
do
n't
believe
it
will
be
for
*NL*
that
he
'll
give
her
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
WILL
give
her
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Strether
waited
a
moment
,
rather
slow
and
deliberate
now
,
drawing
out
a
*NL*
little
this
last
soft
stage
,
pleading
with
her
in
various
suggestive
*NL*
and
unspoken
ways
for
patience
and
understanding
.
``
What
were
you
just
*NL*
about
to
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
he
can
do
that
would
make
you
patch
it
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Mrs.
Newsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
assent
,
as
if
she
had
had
a
delicacy
about
sounding
the
name
,
was
*NL*
only
in
her
face
;
but
she
added
with
it
:
``
Or
is
there
anything
he
can
*NL*
do
that
would
make
HER
try
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
patch
it
up
with
me
?
''
His
answer
came
at
last
in
a
conclusive
*NL*
headshake
.
``
There
's
nothing
any
one
can
do
.
It
's
over
.
Over
for
both
*NL*
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
wondered
,
seemed
a
little
to
doubt
.
``
Are
you
so
sure
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
sure
now
.
Too
much
has
happened
.
I
'm
different
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
it
in
then
,
drawing
a
deeper
breath
.
``
I
see
.
So
that
as
*NL*
she
's
different
for
YOU
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
but
,
''
he
interrupted
,
``
she
's
not
.
''
And
as
Miss
Gostrey
wondered
*NL*
again
:
``
She
's
the
same
.
She
's
more
than
ever
the
same
.
But
I
do
what
*NL*
I
did
n't
before
--
I
SEE
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
gravely
and
as
if
responsibly
--
since
he
had
to
pronounce
;
and
*NL*
the
effect
of
it
was
slightly
solemn
,
so
that
she
simply
exclaimed
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Satisfied
and
grateful
,
however
,
she
showed
in
her
own
next
*NL*
words
an
acceptance
of
his
statement
.
``
What
then
do
you
go
home
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
pushed
his
plate
a
little
away
,
occupied
with
another
side
of
*NL*
the
matter
;
taking
refuge
verily
in
that
side
and
feeling
so
moved
that
*NL*
he
soon
found
himself
on
his
feet
.
He
was
affected
in
advance
by
what
*NL*
he
believed
might
come
from
her
,
and
he
would
have
liked
to
forestall
*NL*
it
and
deal
with
it
tenderly
;
yet
in
the
presence
of
it
he
wished
*NL*
still
more
to
be
--
though
as
smoothly
as
possible
--
deterrent
and
*NL*
conclusive
.
He
put
her
question
by
for
the
moment
;
he
told
her
more
*NL*
about
Chad
.
``
It
would
have
been
impossible
to
meet
me
more
than
he
did
*NL*
last
night
on
the
question
of
the
infamy
of
not
sticking
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
called
it
for
him
--
`
infamy
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
rather
!
I
described
to
him
in
detail
the
base
creature
he
'd
be
,
*NL*
and
he
quite
agrees
with
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
it
's
really
as
if
you
had
nailed
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
really
as
if
--
!
I
told
him
I
should
curse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
smiled
,
``
you
HAVE
done
it
.
''
And
then
having
thought
again
:
*NL*
``
You
CA
N'T
after
that
propose
--
!
''
Yet
she
scanned
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Propose
again
to
Mrs.
Newsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
afresh
,
but
she
brought
it
out
.
``
I
've
never
believed
,
*NL*
you
know
,
that
you
did
propose
.
I
always
believed
it
was
really
*NL*
she
--
and
,
so
far
as
that
goes
,
I
can
understand
it
.
What
I
mean
is
,
''
*NL*
she
explained
,
``
that
with
such
a
spirit
--
the
spirit
of
curses
!
--
your
*NL*
breach
is
past
mending
.
She
has
only
to
know
what
you
've
done
to
him
*NL*
never
again
to
raise
a
finger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
done
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
what
I
could
--
one
ca
n't
do
more
.
He
*NL*
protests
his
devotion
and
his
horror
.
But
I
'm
not
sure
I
've
saved
him
.
*NL*
He
protests
too
much
.
He
asks
how
one
can
dream
of
his
being
tired
.
*NL*
But
he
has
all
life
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
saw
what
he
meant
.
``
He
's
formed
to
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
our
friend
who
has
formed
him
.
''
Strether
felt
in
it
the
*NL*
strange
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
's
scarcely
his
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
at
any
rate
his
danger
.
I
mean
,
''
said
Strether
,
``
it
's
hers
.
But
*NL*
she
knows
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
knows
it
.
And
is
your
idea
,
''
Miss
Gostrey
asked
,
``
that
there
*NL*
was
some
other
woman
in
London
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
No
.
That
is
I
HAVE
no
ideas
.
I
'm
afraid
of
them
.
I
've
done
*NL*
with
them
.
''
And
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
.
``
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
brought
her
back
to
her
unanswered
question
.
``
To
what
do
you
go
*NL*
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
There
will
always
be
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
great
difference
,
''
she
said
as
she
kept
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
difference
--
no
doubt
.
Yet
I
shall
see
what
I
can
make
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
make
anything
so
good
--
?
''
But
,
as
if
remembering
what
Mrs.
*NL*
Newsome
had
done
,
it
was
as
far
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sufficiently
understood
.
``
So
good
as
this
place
at
this
moment
?
*NL*
So
good
as
what
YOU
make
of
everything
you
touch
?
''
He
took
a
moment
to
*NL*
say
,
for
,
really
and
truly
,
what
stood
about
him
there
in
her
*NL*
offer
--
which
was
as
the
offer
of
exquisite
service
,
of
lightened
care
,
*NL*
for
the
rest
of
his
days
--
might
well
have
tempted
.
It
built
him
softly
*NL*
round
,
it
roofed
him
warmly
over
,
it
rested
,
all
so
firm
,
on
selection
.
*NL*
And
what
ruled
selection
was
beauty
and
knowledge
.
It
was
awkward
,
it
*NL*
was
almost
stupid
,
not
to
seem
to
prize
such
things
;
yet
,
none
the
*NL*
less
,
so
far
as
they
made
his
opportunity
they
made
it
only
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
She
'd
moreover
understand
--
she
always
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
indeed
might
be
,
but
meanwhile
she
was
going
on
.
``
There
's
nothing
,
*NL*
you
know
,
I
would
n't
do
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
,
''
she
repeated
,
``
in
all
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
I
know
.
But
all
the
same
I
must
go
.
''
He
had
got
it
at
last
.
*NL*
``
To
be
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
echoed
it
in
vague
deprecation
,
but
he
felt
it
already
clear
*NL*
for
her
.
``
That
,
you
see
,
is
my
only
logic
.
Not
,
out
of
the
whole
*NL*
affair
,
to
have
got
anything
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
.
``
But
with
your
wonderful
impressions
you
'll
have
got
a
*NL*
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
great
deal
''
--
he
agreed
.
``
But
nothing
like
YOU
.
It
's
you
who
would
*NL*
make
me
wrong
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Honest
and
fine
,
she
could
n't
greatly
pretend
she
did
n't
see
it
.
Still
*NL*
she
could
pretend
just
a
little
.
``
But
why
should
you
be
so
dreadfully
*NL*
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
that
--
if
I
must
go
--
you
yourself
would
be
the
first
to
*NL*
want
me
.
And
I
ca
n't
do
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
then
she
had
to
take
it
,
though
still
with
her
defeated
protest
.
``
It
*NL*
is
n't
so
much
your
BEING
`
right
'
--
it
's
your
horrible
sharp
eye
for
what
*NL*
makes
you
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
but
you
're
just
as
bad
yourself
.
You
ca
n't
resist
me
when
I
point
*NL*
that
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
it
at
last
all
comically
,
all
tragically
,
away
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
indeed
resist
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
we
are
!
''
said
Strether
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
