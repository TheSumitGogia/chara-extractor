CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
brilliant
day
in
May
,
in
the
year
1868
,
a
gentleman
was
reclining
*NL*
at
his
ease
on
the
great
circular
divan
which
at
that
period
occupied
*NL*
the
centre
of
the
Salon
Carre
,
in
the
Museum
of
the
Louvre
.
This
*NL*
commodious
ottoman
has
since
been
removed
,
to
the
extreme
regret
of
all
*NL*
weak-kneed
lovers
of
the
fine
arts
,
but
the
gentleman
in
question
had
*NL*
taken
serene
possession
of
its
softest
spot
,
and
,
with
his
head
thrown
*NL*
back
and
his
legs
outstretched
,
was
staring
at
Murillo
's
beautiful
*NL*
moon-borne
Madonna
in
profound
enjoyment
of
his
posture
.
He
had
removed
*NL*
his
hat
,
and
flung
down
beside
him
a
little
red
guide-book
and
an
*NL*
opera-glass
.
The
day
was
warm
;
he
was
heated
with
walking
,
and
he
*NL*
repeatedly
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
forehead
,
with
a
somewhat
*NL*
wearied
gesture
.
And
yet
he
was
evidently
not
a
man
to
whom
fatigue
was
*NL*
familiar
;
long
,
lean
,
and
muscular
,
he
suggested
the
sort
of
vigor
that
*NL*
is
commonly
known
as
``
toughness
.
''
But
his
exertions
on
this
particular
*NL*
day
had
been
of
an
unwonted
sort
,
and
he
had
performed
great
physical
*NL*
feats
which
left
him
less
jaded
than
his
tranquil
stroll
through
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
He
had
looked
out
all
the
pictures
to
which
an
asterisk
was
*NL*
affixed
in
those
formidable
pages
of
fine
print
in
his
Badeker
;
his
*NL*
attention
had
been
strained
and
his
eyes
dazzled
,
and
he
had
sat
down
*NL*
with
an
aesthetic
headache
.
He
had
looked
,
moreover
,
not
only
at
all
the
*NL*
pictures
,
but
at
all
the
copies
that
were
going
forward
around
them
,
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
those
innumerable
young
women
in
irreproachable
toilets
who
*NL*
devote
themselves
,
in
France
,
to
the
propagation
of
masterpieces
,
and
if
*NL*
the
truth
must
be
told
,
he
had
often
admired
the
copy
much
more
than
the
*NL*
original
.
His
physiognomy
would
have
sufficiently
indicated
that
he
was
*NL*
a
shrewd
and
capable
fellow
,
and
in
truth
he
had
often
sat
up
all
night
*NL*
over
a
bristling
bundle
of
accounts
,
and
heard
the
cock
crow
without
a
*NL*
yawn
.
But
Raphael
and
Titian
and
Rubens
were
a
new
kind
of
arithmetic
,
*NL*
and
they
inspired
our
friend
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
with
a
*NL*
vague
self-mistrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
observer
with
anything
of
an
eye
for
national
types
would
have
had
*NL*
no
difficulty
in
determining
the
local
origin
of
this
undeveloped
*NL*
connoisseur
,
and
indeed
such
an
observer
might
have
felt
a
certain
*NL*
humorous
relish
of
the
almost
ideal
completeness
with
which
he
filled
*NL*
out
the
national
mould
.
The
gentleman
on
the
divan
was
a
powerful
*NL*
specimen
of
an
American
.
But
he
was
not
only
a
fine
American
;
he
was
*NL*
in
the
first
place
,
physically
,
a
fine
man
.
He
appeared
to
possess
that
*NL*
kind
of
health
and
strength
which
,
when
found
in
perfection
,
are
the
*NL*
most
impressive
--
the
physical
capital
which
the
owner
does
nothing
to
*NL*
``
keep
up
.
''
If
he
was
a
muscular
Christian
,
it
was
quite
without
knowing
*NL*
it
.
If
it
was
necessary
to
walk
to
a
remote
spot
,
he
walked
,
but
he
had
*NL*
never
known
himself
to
``
exercise
.
''
He
had
no
theory
with
regard
to
*NL*
cold
bathing
or
the
use
of
Indian
clubs
;
he
was
neither
an
oarsman
,
a
*NL*
rifleman
,
nor
a
fencer
--
he
had
never
had
time
for
these
amusements
--
and
*NL*
he
was
quite
unaware
that
the
saddle
is
recommended
for
certain
forms
*NL*
of
indigestion
.
He
was
by
inclination
a
temperate
man
;
but
he
had
supped
*NL*
the
night
before
his
visit
to
the
Louvre
at
the
Cafe
Anglais
--
some
one
*NL*
had
told
him
it
was
an
experience
not
to
be
omitted
--
and
he
had
slept
*NL*
none
the
less
the
sleep
of
the
just
.
His
usual
attitude
and
carriage
*NL*
were
of
a
rather
relaxed
and
lounging
kind
,
but
when
under
a
special
*NL*
inspiration
,
he
straightened
himself
,
he
looked
like
a
grenadier
on
*NL*
parade
.
He
never
smoked
.
He
had
been
assured
--
such
things
are
said
--
that
*NL*
cigars
were
excellent
for
the
health
,
and
he
was
quite
capable
of
*NL*
believing
it
;
but
he
knew
as
little
about
tobacco
as
about
homeopathy
.
*NL*
He
had
a
very
well-formed
head
,
with
a
shapely
,
symmetrical
balance
of
*NL*
the
frontal
and
the
occipital
development
,
and
a
good
deal
of
straight
,
*NL*
rather
dry
brown
hair
.
His
complexion
was
brown
,
and
his
nose
had
a
*NL*
bold
well-marked
arch
.
His
eye
was
of
a
clear
,
cold
gray
,
and
save
for
*NL*
a
rather
abundant
mustache
he
was
clean-shaved
.
He
had
the
flat
jaw
and
*NL*
sinewy
neck
which
are
frequent
in
the
American
type
;
but
the
traces
of
*NL*
national
origin
are
a
matter
of
expression
even
more
than
of
feature
,
*NL*
and
it
was
in
this
respect
that
our
friend
's
countenance
was
supremely
*NL*
eloquent
.
The
discriminating
observer
we
have
been
supposing
might
,
*NL*
however
,
perfectly
have
measured
its
expressiveness
,
and
yet
have
been
*NL*
at
a
loss
to
describe
it
.
It
had
that
typical
vagueness
which
is
not
*NL*
vacuity
,
that
blankness
which
is
not
simplicity
,
that
look
of
being
*NL*
committed
to
nothing
in
particular
,
of
standing
in
an
attitude
of
*NL*
general
hospitality
to
the
chances
of
life
,
of
being
very
much
at
*NL*
one
's
own
disposal
so
characteristic
of
many
American
faces
.
It
was
our
*NL*
friend
's
eye
that
chiefly
told
his
story
;
an
eye
in
which
innocence
*NL*
and
experience
were
singularly
blended
.
It
was
full
of
contradictory
*NL*
suggestions
,
and
though
it
was
by
no
means
the
glowing
orb
of
a
hero
of
*NL*
romance
,
you
could
find
in
it
almost
anything
you
looked
for
.
Frigid
*NL*
and
yet
friendly
,
frank
yet
cautious
,
shrewd
yet
credulous
,
positive
*NL*
yet
skeptical
,
confident
yet
shy
,
extremely
intelligent
and
extremely
*NL*
good-humored
,
there
was
something
vaguely
defiant
in
its
concessions
,
*NL*
and
something
profoundly
reassuring
in
its
reserve
.
The
cut
of
this
*NL*
gentleman
's
mustache
,
with
the
two
premature
wrinkles
in
the
cheek
above
*NL*
it
,
and
the
fashion
of
his
garments
,
in
which
an
exposed
shirt-front
*NL*
and
a
cerulean
cravat
played
perhaps
an
obtrusive
part
,
completed
the
*NL*
conditions
of
his
identity
.
We
have
approached
him
,
perhaps
,
at
a
not
*NL*
especially
favorable
moment
;
he
is
by
no
means
sitting
for
his
portrait
.
*NL*
But
listless
as
he
lounges
there
,
rather
baffled
on
the
aesthetic
*NL*
question
,
and
guilty
of
the
damning
fault
-LRB-
as
we
have
lately
discovered
*NL*
it
to
be
-RRB-
of
confounding
the
merit
of
the
artist
with
that
of
his
work
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
admires
the
squinting
Madonna
of
the
young
lady
with
the
boyish
*NL*
coiffure
,
because
he
thinks
the
young
lady
herself
uncommonly
taking
-RRB-
,
*NL*
he
is
a
sufficiently
promising
acquaintance
.
Decision
,
salubrity
,
*NL*
jocosity
,
prosperity
,
seem
to
hover
within
his
call
;
he
is
evidently
a
*NL*
practical
man
,
but
the
idea
in
his
case
,
has
undefined
and
mysterious
*NL*
boundaries
,
which
invite
the
imagination
to
bestir
itself
on
his
behalf
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
little
copyist
proceeded
with
her
work
,
she
sent
every
now
and
*NL*
then
a
responsive
glance
toward
her
admirer
.
The
cultivation
of
the
fine
*NL*
arts
appeared
to
necessitate
,
to
her
mind
,
a
great
deal
of
byplay
,
a
*NL*
great
standing
off
with
folded
arms
and
head
drooping
from
side
to
side
,
*NL*
stroking
of
a
dimpled
chin
with
a
dimpled
hand
,
sighing
and
frowning
*NL*
and
patting
of
the
foot
,
fumbling
in
disordered
tresses
for
wandering
*NL*
hair-pins
.
These
performances
were
accompanied
by
a
restless
glance
,
*NL*
which
lingered
longer
than
elsewhere
upon
the
gentleman
we
have
*NL*
described
.
At
last
he
rose
abruptly
,
put
on
his
hat
,
and
approached
the
*NL*
young
lady
.
He
placed
himself
before
her
picture
and
looked
at
it
for
*NL*
some
moments
,
during
which
she
pretended
to
be
quite
unconscious
of
his
*NL*
inspection
.
Then
,
addressing
her
with
the
single
word
which
constituted
*NL*
the
strength
of
his
French
vocabulary
,
and
holding
up
one
finger
in
a
*NL*
manner
which
appeared
to
him
to
illuminate
his
meaning
,
``
Combien
?
''
he
*NL*
abruptly
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
stared
a
moment
,
gave
a
little
pout
,
shrugged
her
shoulders
,
*NL*
put
down
her
palette
and
brushes
,
and
stood
rubbing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
said
our
friend
,
in
English
.
``
Combien
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
wishes
to
buy
it
?
''
asked
the
young
lady
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty
,
splendide
.
Combien
?
''
repeated
the
American
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
pleases
monsieur
,
my
little
picture
?
It
's
a
very
beautiful
subject
,
''
*NL*
said
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Madonna
,
yes
;
I
am
not
a
Catholic
,
but
I
want
to
buy
it
.
Combien
?
*NL*
Write
it
here
.
''
And
he
took
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
and
showed
her
the
*NL*
fly-leaf
of
his
guide-book
.
She
stood
looking
at
him
and
scratching
her
*NL*
chin
with
the
pencil
.
``
Is
it
not
for
sale
?
''
he
asked
.
And
as
she
still
*NL*
stood
reflecting
,
and
looking
at
him
with
an
eye
which
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
desire
to
treat
this
avidity
of
patronage
as
a
very
old
story
,
betrayed
*NL*
an
almost
touching
incredulity
,
he
was
afraid
he
had
offended
her
.
She
*NL*
simply
trying
to
look
indifferent
,
and
wondering
how
far
she
might
go
.
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
made
a
mistake
--
pas
insulte
,
no
?
''
her
interlocutor
continued
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
understand
a
little
English
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
's
aptitude
for
playing
a
part
at
short
notice
was
*NL*
remarkable
.
She
fixed
him
with
her
conscious
,
perceptive
eye
and
asked
*NL*
him
if
he
spoke
no
French
.
Then
,
``
Donnez
!
''
she
said
briefly
,
and
took
*NL*
the
open
guide-book
.
In
the
upper
corner
of
the
fly-leaf
she
traced
a
*NL*
number
,
in
a
minute
and
extremely
neat
hand
.
Then
she
handed
back
the
*NL*
book
and
took
up
her
palette
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
friend
read
the
number
:
``
2,000
francs
.
''
He
said
nothing
for
a
time
,
*NL*
but
stood
looking
at
the
picture
,
while
the
copyist
began
actively
to
*NL*
dabble
with
her
paint
.
``
For
a
copy
,
is
n't
that
a
good
deal
?
''
he
asked
at
*NL*
last
.
``
Pas
beaucoup
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
raised
her
eyes
from
her
palette
,
scanned
him
from
head
*NL*
to
foot
,
and
alighted
with
admirable
sagacity
upon
exactly
the
right
*NL*
answer
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
good
deal
.
But
my
copy
has
remarkable
qualities
,
it
*NL*
is
worth
nothing
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
in
whom
we
are
interested
understood
no
French
,
but
I
*NL*
have
said
he
was
intelligent
,
and
here
is
a
good
chance
to
prove
it
.
*NL*
He
apprehended
,
by
a
natural
instinct
,
the
meaning
of
the
young
woman
's
*NL*
phrase
,
and
it
gratified
him
to
think
that
she
was
so
honest
.
Beauty
,
*NL*
talent
,
virtue
;
she
combined
everything
!
``
But
you
must
finish
it
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
FINISH
,
you
know
;
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
unpainted
hand
of
the
*NL*
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
shall
be
finished
in
perfection
;
in
the
perfection
of
*NL*
perfections
!
''
cried
mademoiselle
;
and
to
confirm
her
promise
,
she
*NL*
deposited
a
rosy
blotch
in
the
middle
of
the
Madonna
's
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
American
frowned
.
``
Ah
,
too
red
,
too
red
!
''
he
rejoined
.
``
Her
*NL*
complexion
,
''
pointing
to
the
Murillo
,
``
is
--
more
delicate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delicate
?
Oh
,
it
shall
be
delicate
,
monsieur
;
delicate
as
Sevres
*NL*
biscuit
.
I
am
going
to
tone
that
down
;
I
know
all
the
secrets
of
my
art
.
*NL*
And
where
will
you
allow
us
to
send
it
to
you
?
Your
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
address
?
Oh
yes
!
''
And
the
gentleman
drew
a
card
from
his
pocket-book
*NL*
and
wrote
something
upon
it
.
Then
hesitating
a
moment
he
said
,
``
If
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
it
when
it
it
's
finished
,
you
know
,
I
shall
not
be
obliged
to
*NL*
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
seemed
as
good
a
guesser
as
himself
.
``
Oh
,
I
am
very
sure
*NL*
that
monsieur
is
not
capricious
,
''
she
said
with
a
roguish
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capricious
?
''
And
at
this
monsieur
began
to
laugh
.
``
Oh
no
,
I
'm
not
*NL*
capricious
.
I
am
very
faithful
.
I
am
very
constant
.
Comprenez
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
is
constant
;
I
understand
perfectly
.
It
's
a
rare
virtue
.
To
*NL*
recompense
you
,
you
shall
have
your
picture
on
the
first
possible
day
;
*NL*
next
week
--
as
soon
as
it
is
dry
.
I
will
take
the
card
of
monsieur
.
''
And
*NL*
she
took
it
and
read
his
name
:
``
Christopher
Newman
.
''
Then
she
tried
to
*NL*
repeat
it
aloud
,
and
laughed
at
her
bad
accent
.
``
Your
English
names
are
*NL*
so
droll
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Droll
?
''
said
Mr.
Newman
,
laughing
too
.
``
Did
you
ever
hear
of
*NL*
Christopher
Columbus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bien
sur
!
He
invented
America
;
a
very
great
man
.
And
is
he
your
*NL*
patron

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
patron
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
patron-saint
,
in
the
calendar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
exactly
;
my
parents
named
me
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
is
American
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
it
?
''
monsieur
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
to
carry
my
little
picture
away
over
there
?
''
and
she
*NL*
explained
her
phrase
with
a
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
mean
to
buy
a
great
many
pictures
--
beaucoup
,
beaucoup
,
''
said
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
honor
is
not
less
for
me
,
''
the
young
lady
answered
,
``
for
I
am
sure
*NL*
monsieur
has
a
great
deal
of
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
give
me
your
card
,
''
Newman
said
;
``
your
card
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
looked
severe
for
an
instant
,
and
then
said
,
``
My
father
*NL*
will
wait
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
Mr.
Newman
's
powers
of
divination
were
at
fault
.
``
Your
*NL*
card
,
your
address
,
''
he
simply
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
address
?
''
said
mademoiselle
.
Then
with
a
little
shrug
,
``
Happily
for
*NL*
you
,
you
are
an
American
!
It
is
the
first
time
I
ever
gave
my
card
to
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
''
And
,
taking
from
her
pocket
a
rather
greasy
porte-monnaie
,
*NL*
she
extracted
from
it
a
small
glazed
visiting
card
,
and
presented
the
*NL*
latter
to
her
patron
.
It
was
neatly
inscribed
in
pencil
,
with
a
great
*NL*
many
flourishes
,
``
Mlle.
Noemie
Nioche
.
''
But
Mr.
Newman
,
unlike
his
*NL*
companion
,
read
the
name
with
perfect
gravity
;
all
French
names
to
him
*NL*
were
equally
droll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
precisely
,
here
is
my
father
,
who
has
come
to
escort
me
home
,
''
said
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
``
He
speaks
English
.
He
will
arrange
with
you
.
''
*NL*
And
she
turned
to
welcome
a
little
old
gentleman
who
came
shuffling
up
,
*NL*
peering
over
his
spectacles
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
wore
a
glossy
wig
,
of
an
unnatural
color
which
overhung
his
*NL*
little
meek
,
white
,
vacant
face
,
and
left
it
hardly
more
expressive
*NL*
than
the
unfeatured
block
upon
which
these
articles
are
displayed
in
*NL*
the
barber
's
window
.
He
was
an
exquisite
image
of
shabby
gentility
.
His
*NL*
scant
ill-made
coat
,
desperately
brushed
,
his
darned
gloves
,
his
highly
*NL*
polished
boots
,
his
rusty
,
shapely
hat
,
told
the
story
of
a
person
who
*NL*
had
``
had
losses
''
and
who
clung
to
the
spirit
of
nice
habits
even
though
*NL*
the
letter
had
been
hopelessly
effaced
.
Among
other
things
M.
Nioche
had
*NL*
lost
courage
.
Adversity
had
not
only
ruined
him
,
it
had
frightened
him
,
*NL*
and
he
was
evidently
going
through
his
remnant
of
life
on
tiptoe
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
waking
up
the
hostile
fates
.
If
this
strange
gentleman
was
*NL*
saying
anything
improper
to
his
daughter
,
M.
Nioche
would
entreat
him
*NL*
huskily
,
as
a
particular
favor
,
to
forbear
;
but
he
would
admit
at
the
*NL*
same
time
that
he
was
very
presumptuous
to
ask
for
particular
favors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
has
bought
my
picture
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
``
When
it
's
*NL*
finished
you
'll
carry
it
to
him
in
a
cab
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
cab
!
''
cried
M.
Nioche
;
and
he
stared
,
in
a
bewildered
way
,
as
if
*NL*
he
had
seen
the
sun
rising
at
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
young
lady
's
father
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
think
she
said
you
*NL*
speak
English
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
English
--
yes
,
''
said
the
old
man
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
.
``
I
will
*NL*
bring
it
in
a
cab
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
something
,
then
,
''
cried
his
daughter
.
``
Thank
him
a
little
--
not
too
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
my
daughter
,
a
little
?
''
said
M.
Nioche
perplexed
.
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
thousand
!
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
``
Do
n't
make
a
fuss
or
he
'll
*NL*
take
back
his
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
thousand
!
''
cried
the
old
man
,
and
he
began
to
fumble
for
his
*NL*
snuff-box
.
He
looked
at
Newman
from
head
to
foot
;
he
looked
at
his
*NL*
daughter
and
then
at
the
picture
.
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
spoil
it
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
almost
sublimely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
go
home
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
``
This
is
a
good
day
's
work
.
*NL*
Take
care
how
you
carry
it
!
''
And
she
began
to
put
up
her
utensils
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
thank
you
?
''
said
M.
Nioche
.
``
My
English
does
not
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
spoke
French
as
well
,
''
said
Newman
,
good-naturedly
.
``
Your
*NL*
daughter
is
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
!
''
and
M.
Nioche
looked
over
his
spectacles
with
tearful
eyes
*NL*
and
nodded
several
times
with
a
world
of
sadness
.
``
She
has
had
an
*NL*
education
--
tres-superieure
!
Nothing
was
spared
.
Lessons
in
pastel
at
ten
*NL*
francs
the
lesson
,
lessons
in
oil
at
twelve
francs
.
I
did
n't
look
at
the
*NL*
francs
then
.
She
's
an
artiste
,
ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
understand
you
to
say
that
you
have
had
reverses
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverses
?
Oh
,
sir
,
misfortunes
--
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unsuccessful
in

eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
unsuccessful
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
fear
,
you
'll
get
on
your
legs
again
,
''
said
Newman
cheerily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
drooped
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
him
with
an
*NL*
expression
of
pain
,
as
if
this
were
an
unfeeling
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
say
?
''
demanded
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
``
He
says
I
will
make
my
fortune
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
will
help
you

And
what
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
thou
art
very
clever

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
possible

You

it
yourself

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
it

my
daughter

With
this
evidence

And
the
old
man
turned
*NL*
afresh
,
with
a
staring
,
wondering
homage
,
to
the
audacious
daub
on
the
*NL*
easel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
,
then

would
not

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
From

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pas

immediately

''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
with
*NL*
soft
brevity
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
stood
aghast
,
but
under
his
daughter
's
eye
he
collected
his
*NL*
wits
,
and
,
doing
his
best
to
assume
an
agreeable
smile
,
he
executed
her
*NL*
commands
.
``
Would
it
please
you
to
receive
instruction
in
our
beautiful
*NL*
language
?
''
he
inquired
,
with
an
appealing
quaver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
study
French
?
''
asked
Newman
,
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
pressed
his
finger-tips
together
and
slowly
raised
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
``
A
little
conversation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Conversation
--
that
's
it
!
''
murmured
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
who
had
caught
*NL*
the
word
.
``
The
conversation
of
the
best
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
French
conversation
is
famous
,
you
know

M.
Nioche
ventured
to
*NL*
continue
.
``
It
's
a
great
talent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
n't
it
awfully
difficult
?
''
asked
Newman
,
very
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
a
man
of
esprit
,
like
monsieur
,
an
admirer
of
beauty
in
every
*NL*
form
!
''
and
M.
Nioche
cast
a
significant
glance
at
his
daughter
's
*NL*
Madonna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
fancy
myself
chattering
French
!
''
said
Newman
with
a
laugh
.
``
And
*NL*
yet
,
I
suppose
that
the
more
a
man
knows
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
expresses
that
very
happily

Helas

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
would
help
me
a
great
deal

knocking
about
Paris

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
are
so
many

difficult

*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
I
want

difficult

But
you
give

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
M.
Nioche
was
embarrassed
;
he
smiled
more
appealingly
.
``
I
am
not
a
*NL*
regular
professor
,
''
he
admitted
.
``
I
ca
n't
nevertheless
tell
him
that
I
'm
*NL*
a
professor

he
said
to
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him

's
a
very
exceptional
chance

answered
Mademoiselle
Noemie
;
*NL*
``
an

one
gentleman
conversing

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
teacher

Much
more
formerly

less
to-day

asks
the
price
of
the
lessons

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo

said
Mademoiselle

.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
he

I
may
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

That
's
bad

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

asks

*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
had
put
on
her
bonnet
and
was
tying
the
ribbons
.
*NL*
She
smoothed
them
out
,
with
her
soft
little
chin
thrust
forward
.
``
Ten
*NL*
francs

she
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

my

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
will
make
out

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
turned
to
the
confiding
foreigner
again
,
and
stood
rubbing
*NL*
his
hands
,
with
an
air
of
seeming
to
plead
guilty
which
was
not
intenser
*NL*
only
because
it
was
habitually
so
striking
.
It
never
occurred
to
Newman
*NL*
to
ask
him
for
a
guarantee
of
his
skill
in
imparting
instruction
;
he
*NL*
supposed
of
course
M.
Nioche
knew
his
own
language
,
and
his
appealing
*NL*
forlornness
was
quite
the
perfection
of
what
the
American
,
for
vague
*NL*
reasons
,
had
always
associated
with
all
elderly
foreigners
of
the
*NL*
lesson-giving
class
.
Newman
had
never
reflected
upon
philological
*NL*
processes
.
His
chief
impression
with
regard
to
ascertaining
those
*NL*
mysterious
correlatives
of
his
familiar
English
vocables
which
were
*NL*
current
in
this
extraordinary
city
of
Paris
was
,
that
it
was
simply
a
*NL*
matter
of
a
good
deal
of
unwonted
and
rather
ridiculous
muscular
effort
*NL*
on
his
own
part
.
``
How
did
you
learn
English
?
''
he
asked
of
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
was
young
,
before
my
miseries
.
Oh
,
I
was
wide
awake
,
then
.
*NL*
My
father
was
a
great
commercant
;
he
placed
me
for
a
year
in
a
*NL*
counting-house
in
England
.
Some
of
it
stuck
to
me
;
but
I
have
*NL*
forgotten
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
French
can
I
learn
in
a
month
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
say
?

asked
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
speak
like
an
angel

said
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
native
integrity
which
had
been
vainly
exerted
to
secure
M.
*NL*
Nioche
's
commercial
prosperity
flickered
up
again
.
``
Dame
,
monsieur
!
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
``
All
I
can
teach
you
!
''
And
then
,
recovering
himself
at
a
sign
*NL*
from
his
daughter
,
``
I
will
wait
upon
you
at
your
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
should
like
to
learn
French

Newman
went
on
,
with
democratic
*NL*
confidingness
.
``
Hang
me
if
I
should
ever
have
thought
of
it
!
I
took
for
*NL*
granted
it
was
impossible

But
if
you
learned
my
language
,
why
should
n't
*NL*
I
learn
yours

''
and
his
frank
,
friendly
laugh
drew
the
sting
from
the
*NL*
jest
.
``
Only

if
we
are
going

converse

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

very
good

M.
Nioche
,
throwing
out
*NL*
his
hands
.
``
But
you
have
cheerfulness
and
happiness
for
two

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

said
Newman
more
seriously
.
``
You
must
be
bright

lively

that
's
part
of
the
bargain

Nioche
bowed
,
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
.
``
Very
well

already
made
me
lively

Mademoiselle
Noemie
had
collected
her
accessories
,
and
she
gave
the
*NL*
precious
Madonna
in
charge
to
her
father
,
who
retreated
backwards
out
*NL*
of
sight
,
holding
it
at
arm

length
and
reiterating
his
obeisance

The
*NL*
young
lady
gathered
her
shawl
about
her
like
a
perfect
Parisienne

and
*NL*
it
was
with
the
smile

a
Parisienne
that
she
took
leave

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
back
to
the
divan
and
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
,
*NL*
in
view
of
the
great
canvas
on
which
Paul
Veronese
had
depicted
*NL*
the
marriage-feast
of
Cana
.
Wearied
as
he
was
he
found
the
picture
*NL*
entertaining
;
it
had
an
illusion
for
him
;
it
satisfied
his
conception
,
*NL*
which
was
ambitious
,
of
what
a
splendid
banquet
should
be
.
In
the
*NL*
left-hand
corner
of
the
picture
is
a
young
woman
with
yellow
tresses
*NL*
confined
in
a
golden
head-dress
;
she
is
bending
forward
and
listening
,
*NL*
with
the
smile
of
a
charming
woman
at
a
dinner-party
,
to
her
neighbor
.
*NL*
Newman
detected
her
in
the
crowd
,
admired
her
,
and
perceived
that
she
*NL*
too
had
her
votive
copyist
--
a
young
man
with
his
hair
standing
on
*NL*
end
.
Suddenly
he
became
conscious
of
the
germ
of
the
mania
of
the
*NL*
``
collector
;
''
he
had
taken
the
first
step
;
why
should
he
not
go
on
?
It
*NL*
was
only
twenty
minutes
before
that
he
had
bought
the
first
picture
*NL*
of
his
life
,
and
now
he
was
already
thinking
of
art-patronage
as
a
*NL*
fascinating
pursuit
.
His
reflections
quickened
his
good-humor
,
and
he
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
approaching
the
young
man
with
another
``
Combien
?
''
*NL*
Two
or
three
facts
in
this
relation
are
noticeable
,
although
the
logical
*NL*
chain
which
connects
them
may
seem
imperfect
.
He
knew
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
had
asked
too
much
;
he
bore
her
no
grudge
for
doing
so
,
and
he
*NL*
was
determined
to
pay
the
young
man
exactly
the
proper
sum
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
,
however
,
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
gentleman
who
had
come
*NL*
from
another
part
of
the
room
and
whose
manner
was
that
of
a
stranger
*NL*
to
the
gallery
,
although
he
was
equipped
with
neither
guide-book
nor
*NL*
opera-glass
.
He
carried
a
white
sun-umbrella
,
lined
with
blue
silk
,
and
*NL*
he
strolled
in
front
of
the
Paul
Veronese
,
vaguely
looking
at
it
,
but
*NL*
much
too
near
to
see
anything
but
the
grain
of
the
canvas
.
Opposite
to
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
he
paused
and
turned
,
and
then
our
friend
,
who
had
*NL*
been
observing
him
,
had
a
chance
to
verify
a
suspicion
aroused
by
an
*NL*
imperfect
view
of
his
face
.
The
result
of
this
larger
scrutiny
was
that
*NL*
he
presently
sprang
to
his
feet
,
strode
across
the
room
,
and
,
with
an
*NL*
outstretched
hand
,
arrested
the
gentleman
with
the
blue-lined
umbrella
.
*NL*
The
latter
stared
,
but
put
out
his
hand
at
a
venture
.
He
was
corpulent
*NL*
and
rosy
,
and
though
his
countenance
,
which
was
ornamented
with
a
*NL*
beautiful
flaxen
beard
,
carefully
divided
in
the
middle
and
brushed
*NL*
outward
at
the
sides
,
was
not
remarkable
for
intensity
of
expression
,
*NL*
he
looked
like
a
person
who
would
willingly
shake
hands
with
any
one
.
*NL*
I
know
not
what
Newman
thought
of
his
face
,
but
he
found
a
want
of
*NL*
response
in
his
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
come
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
;
``
do
n't
say
,
now
,
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
me
--
if
I
have
NOT
got
a
white
parasol
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
his
voice
quickened
the
other
's
memory
,
his
face
expanded
*NL*
to
its
fullest
capacity
,
and
he
also
broke
into
a
laugh
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
Newman
--
I
'll
be
blowed
!
Where
in
the
world
--
I
declare
--
who
would
have
*NL*
thought
?
You
know
you
have
changed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have

''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

the

no

When
did
you
get
here
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Three

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

been
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
eight
or
nine
since
we
met

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
that
sort
.
We
were
very
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
in
St.
Louis
,
during
the
war

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

But

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
out
all
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
out
with
my
legs

and
with
satisfaction

All
that
seems
*NL*
very
far
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how

have

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

much
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
was
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
with
a
tranquil
smile
*NL*
he
answered
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
come
to
Paris
to
spend
it
,
eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

shall
see

So

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

``

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tristram
gave
a
mellow
smile
of
self-gratulation
.
``
Well

I
guess

there

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bought

said
Mr.
Tristram
,
looking
vaguely
round
at
the
*NL*
walls
.
``
Why

sell

Mr.

nodding
at
the
Titians

Vandykes
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Newman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

''
said
Mr.
Tristram
,
mysteriously
,
``
you
can
never
tell

They
*NL*
imitate

you

so
deucedly
well

false
stones

Go
into

Palais

there

you
see

half

obliges

stick

you

ca
n't
tell

Mr.
Tristram
continued
,
*NL*
with
a
wry
face
,
``
I
do
n't
do

``

said
Christopher
Newman

stretching
his

a
little
,
with
a

sigh
,
``
I
envy
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

answered
Mr.

giving
him
a
little
poke
with

his
parasol

*NL*
``
I

speak
French
as
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Better

''
said
Mr.
Tristram
,
roundly
.
``
It
's
a
splendid
language

You
can
*NL*
say
all
sorts
of
bright
things
in
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
suppose
,
''
said
Christopher
Newman
,
with
an
earnest
desire
for
*NL*
information
,
``
that
you
must
be
bright
to
begin
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
;
that
's
just
the
beauty
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
,
as
they
exchanged
these
remarks
,
had
remained
standing
*NL*
where
they
met
,
and
leaning
against
the
rail
which
protected
the
*NL*
pictures
.
Mr.
Tristram
at
last
declared
that
he
was
overcome
with
*NL*
fatigue
and
should
be
happy
to
sit
down
.
Newman
recommended
in
the
*NL*
highest
terms
the
great
divan
on
which
he
had
been
lounging
,
and
they
*NL*
prepared
to
seat
themselves
.
``
This
is
a
great
place
;
is
n't
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Newman
,
with
ardor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
place
,
great
place
.
Finest
thing
in
the
world

''
And
then
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
Mr.
Tristram
hesitated
and
looked
about
him
.
``
I
suppose
they
*NL*
wo
n't
let
you
smoke
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stared
.
``
Smoke
?
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know

You
know
the
regulations

better
than
I.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
never
was
here
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
my

dragged
me
here
once
when

first
came
to

I
never

way
back

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

say

know
Paris
so
well

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Mr.
Tristram
,
with
assurance
.
``
Come

*NL*
let
's
go
over
to
the
Palais
Royal
and
have
a
smoke

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

then

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mr.
Tristram
led
his
companion
away
.
They
passed
through
the
*NL*
glorious
halls
of
the
Louvre
,
down
the
staircases
,
along
the
cool
,
dim
*NL*
galleries
of
sculpture
,
and
out
into
the
enormous
court
.
Newman
looked
*NL*
about
him
as
he
went
,
but
he
made
no
comments
,
and
it
was
only
when
they
*NL*
at
last
emerged
into
the
open
air
that
he
said
to
his
friend
,
``
It
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
in
your
place
I
should
have
come
here
once
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
you
would
n't
!
''
said
Mr.
Tristram
.
``
You
think
so
,
but
you
*NL*
would
n't

You
would
n't
have
had
time
.
You
would
always
mean
to
go
,
but
*NL*
you
never
would
go
.
There
's
better
fun
than
that
,
here
in
Paris
.
Italy
's
*NL*
the
place
to
see
pictures
;
wait
till
you
get
there
.
There
you
have
to
*NL*
go
;
you
ca
n't
do
anything
else
.
It
's
an
awful
country
;
you
ca
n't
get
a
*NL*
decent
cigar
.
I
do
n't
know
why
I
went
in
there
,
to-day
;
I
was
strolling
*NL*
along
,
rather
hard
up
for
amusement
.
I
sort
of
noticed
the
Louvre
as
I
*NL*
passed
,
and
I
thought
I
would
go
in
and
see
what
was
going
on
.
But
if
I
*NL*
had
n't
found
you
there
I
should
have
felt
rather
sold
.
Hang
it
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
for
pictures
;
I
prefer
the
reality
!
''
And
Mr.
Tristram
tossed
off
*NL*
this
happy
formula
with
an
assurance
which
the
numerous
class
of
persons
*NL*
suffering
from
an
overdose
of
``
culture
''
might
have
envied
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
proceeded
along
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
and
into
the
*NL*
Palais
Royal
,
where
they
seated
themselves
at
one
of
the
little
tables
*NL*
stationed
at
the
door
of
the
cafe
which
projects
into
the
great
open
*NL*
quadrangle
.
The
place
was
filled
with
people
,
the
fountains
were
*NL*
spouting
,
a
band
was
playing
,
clusters
of
chairs
were
gathered
beneath
*NL*
all
the
lime-trees
,
and
buxom
,
white-capped
nurses
,
seated
along
the
*NL*
benches
,
were
offering
to
their
infant
charges
the
amplest
facilities
*NL*
for
nutrition
.
There
was
an
easy
,
homely
gayety
in
the
whole
scene
,
and
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
felt
that
it
was
most
characteristically
Parisian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
began
Mr.
Tristram
,
when
they
had
tested
the
decoction
*NL*
which
he
had
caused
to
be
served
to
them
,
``
now
just
give
an
account
of
*NL*
yourself
.
What
are
your
ideas
,
what
are
your
plans
,
where
have
you
*NL*
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
?
In
the
first
place
,
where
are
you
*NL*
staying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Grand
Hotel
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Tristram
puckered
his
plump
visage
.
``
That
wo
n't
do
!
You
must
*NL*
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Change
?
''
demanded
Newman
.
``
Why
,
it
's
the
finest
hotel
I
ever
was
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
a
`
fine
'
hotel
;
you
want
something
small
and
quiet
*NL*
and
elegant
,
where
your
bell
is
answered
and
you
--
your
person
is
*NL*
recognized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
keep
running
to
see
if
I
have
rung
before
I
have
touched
the
*NL*
bell
,
''
said
Newman
``
and
as
for
my
person
they
are
always
bowing
and
*NL*
scraping
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
are
always
tipping
them
.
That
's
very
bad
style
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
?
By
no
means
.
A
man
brought
me
something
yesterday
,
and
then
*NL*
stood
loafing
in
a
beggarly
manner
.
I
offered
him
a
chair
and
asked
him
*NL*
if
he
would
n't
sit
down
.
Was
that
bad
style
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
bolted
,
instantly
.
At
any
rate
,
the
place
amuses
me
.
Hang
your
*NL*
elegance
,
if
it
bores
me
.
I
sat
in
the
court
of
the
Grand
Hotel
last
*NL*
night
until
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
watching
the
coming
and
going
,
*NL*
and
the
people
knocking
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
easily
pleased
.
But
you
can
do
as
you
choose
--
a
man
in
your
*NL*
shoes
.
You
have
made
a
pile
of
money
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
enough
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
the
man
who
can
say
that
?
Enough
for
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
to
rest
awhile
,
to
forget
the
confounded
thing
,
to
look
about
*NL*
me
,
to
see
the
world
,
to
have
a
good
time
,
to
improve
my
mind
,
and
,
*NL*
if
the
fancy
takes
me
,
to
marry
a
wife
.
''
Newman
spoke
slowly
,
with
*NL*
a
certain
dryness
of
accent
and
with
frequent
pauses
.
This
was
his
*NL*
habitual
mode
of
utterance
,
but
it
was
especially
marked
in
the
words
I
*NL*
have
just
quoted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jupiter
!
There
's
a
programme
!
''
cried
Mr.
Tristram
.
``
Certainly
,
all
that
*NL*
takes
money
,
especially
the
wife
;
unless
indeed
she
gives
it
,
as
mine
*NL*
did
.
And
what
's
the
story
?
How
have
you
done
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
pushed
his
hat
back
from
his
forehead
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
stretched
his
legs
.
He
listened
to
the
music
,
he
looked
about
him
at
the
*NL*
bustling
crowd
,
at
the
plashing
fountains
,
at
the
nurses
and
the
babies
.
*NL*
``
I
have
worked
!
''
he
answered
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tristram
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
,
and
allowed
his
placid
eyes
to
*NL*
measure
his
friend
's
generous
longitude
and
rest
upon
his
comfortably
*NL*
contemplative
face
.
``
What
have
you
worked
at
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
at
several
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
're
a
smart
fellow
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
continued
to
look
at
the
nurses
and
babies
;
they
imparted
to
the
*NL*
scene
a
kind
of
primordial
,
pastoral
simplicity
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
am
.
''
And
then
,
in
answer
to
his
companion
's
inquiries
,
*NL*
he
related
briefly
his
history
since
their
last
meeting
.
It
was
an
*NL*
intensely
Western
story
,
and
it
dealt
with
enterprises
which
it
will
be
*NL*
needless
to
introduce
to
the
reader
in
detail
.
Newman
had
come
out
*NL*
of
the
war
with
a
brevet
of
brigadier-general
,
an
honor
which
in
this
*NL*
case
--
without
invidious
comparisons
--
had
lighted
upon
shoulders
amply
*NL*
competent
to
bear
it
.
But
though
he
could
manage
a
fight
,
when
need
was
,
*NL*
Newman
heartily
disliked
the
business
;
his
four
years
in
the
army
*NL*
had
left
him
with
an
angry
,
bitter
sense
of
the
waste
of
precious
*NL*
things
--
life
and
time
and
money
and
``
smartness
''
and
the
early
freshness
*NL*
of
purpose
;
and
he
had
addressed
himself
to
the
pursuits
of
peace
*NL*
with
passionate
zest
and
energy
.
He
was
of
course
as
penniless
when
he
*NL*
plucked
off
his
shoulder-straps
as
when
he
put
them
on
,
and
the
only
*NL*
capital
at
his
disposal
was
his
dogged
resolution
and
his
lively
*NL*
perception
of
ends
and
means
.
Exertion
and
action
were
as
natural
to
*NL*
him
as
respiration
;
a
more
completely
healthy
mortal
had
never
trod
the
*NL*
elastic
soil
of
the
West
.
His
experience
,
moreover
,
was
as
wide
as
his
*NL*
capacity
;
when
he
was
fourteen
years
old
,
necessity
had
taken
him
by
*NL*
his
slim
young
shoulders
and
pushed
him
into
the
street
,
to
earn
that
*NL*
night
's
supper
.
He
had
not
earned
it
but
he
had
earned
the
next
night
's
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
,
whenever
he
had
had
none
,
it
was
because
he
had
gone
*NL*
without
it
to
use
the
money
for
something
else
,
a
keener
pleasure
or
*NL*
a
finer
profit
.
He
had
turned
his
hand
,
with
his
brain
in
it
,
to
many
*NL*
things
;
he
had
been
enterprising
,
in
an
eminent
sense
of
the
term
;
he
*NL*
had
been
adventurous
and
even
reckless
,
and
he
had
known
bitter
failure
*NL*
as
well
as
brilliant
success
;
but
he
was
a
born
experimentalist
,
and
he
*NL*
had
always
found
something
to
enjoy
in
the
pressure
of
necessity
,
even
*NL*
when
it
was
as
irritating
as
the
haircloth
shirt
of
the
mediaeval
monk
.
*NL*
At
one
time
failure
seemed
inexorably
his
portion
;
ill-luck
became
*NL*
his
bed-fellow
,
and
whatever
he
touched
he
turned
,
not
to
gold
,
but
*NL*
to
ashes
.
His
most
vivid
conception
of
a
supernatural
element
in
the
*NL*
world
's
affairs
had
come
to
him
once
when
this
pertinacity
of
misfortune
*NL*
was
at
its
climax
;
there
seemed
to
him
something
stronger
in
life
than
*NL*
his
own
will
.
But
the
mysterious
something
could
only
be
the
devil
,
*NL*
and
he
was
accordingly
seized
with
an
intense
personal
enmity
to
this
*NL*
impertinent
force
.
He
had
known
what
it
was
to
have
utterly
exhausted
*NL*
his
credit
,
to
be
unable
to
raise
a
dollar
,
and
to
find
himself
*NL*
at
nightfall
in
a
strange
city
,
without
a
penny
to
mitigate
its
*NL*
strangeness
.
It
was
under
these
circumstances
that
he
made
his
entrance
*NL*
into
San
Francisco
,
the
scene
,
subsequently
,
of
his
happiest
strokes
of
*NL*
fortune
.
If
he
did
not
,
like
Dr.
Franklin
in
Philadelphia
,
march
along
*NL*
the
street
munching
a
penny-loaf
,
it
was
only
because
he
had
not
the
*NL*
penny-loaf
necessary
to
the
performance
.
In
his
darkest
days
he
had
had
*NL*
but
one
simple
,
practical
impulse
--
the
desire
,
as
he
would
have
phrased
*NL*
it
,
to
see
the
thing
through
.
He
did
so
at
last
,
buffeted
his
way
into
*NL*
smooth
waters
,
and
made
money
largely
.
It
must
be
admitted
,
rather
*NL*
nakedly
,
that
Christopher
Newman
's
sole
aim
in
life
had
been
to
*NL*
make
money
;
what
he
had
been
placed
in
the
world
for
was
,
to
his
own
*NL*
perception
,
simply
to
wrest
a
fortune
,
the
bigger
the
better
,
from
*NL*
defiant
opportunity
.
This
idea
completely
filled
his
horizon
and
*NL*
satisfied
his
imagination
.
Upon
the
uses
of
money
,
upon
what
one
might
*NL*
do
with
a
life
into
which
one
had
succeeded
in
injecting
the
golden
*NL*
stream
,
he
had
up
to
his
thirty-fifth
year
very
scantily
reflected
.
Life
*NL*
had
been
for
him
an
open
game
,
and
he
had
played
for
high
stakes
.
He
had
*NL*
won
at
last
and
carried
off
his
winnings
;
and
now
what
was
he
to
do
with
*NL*
them
?
He
was
a
man
to
whom
,
sooner
or
later
,
the
question
was
sure
to
*NL*
present
itself
,
and
the
answer
to
it
belongs
to
our
story
.
A
vague
sense
*NL*
that
more
answers
were
possible
than
his
philosophy
had
hitherto
*NL*
dreamt
of
had
already
taken
possession
of
him
,
and
it
seemed
softly
and
*NL*
agreeably
to
deepen
as
he
lounged
in
this
brilliant
corner
of
Paris
with
*NL*
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
,
''
he
presently
went
on
,
``
that
here
I
do
n't
feel
at
*NL*
all
smart
.
My
remarkable
talents
seem
of
no
use
.
I
feel
as
simple
as
a
*NL*
little
child
,
and
a
little
child
might
take
me
by
the
hand
and
lead
me
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
be
your
little
child
,
''
said
Tristram
,
jovially
;
``
I
'll
take
you
*NL*
by
the
hand
.
Trust
yourself
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
good
worker
,
''
Newman
continued
,
``
but
I
rather
think
I
am
a
poor
*NL*
loafer
.
I
have
come
abroad
to
amuse
myself
,
but
I
doubt
whether
I
know
*NL*
how
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
easily
learned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
may
perhaps
learn
it
,
but
I
am
afraid
I
shall
never
do
it
by
*NL*
rote
.
I
have
the
best
will
in
the
world
about
it
,
but
my
genius
does
n't
*NL*
lie
in
that
direction
.
As
a
loafer
I
shall
never
be
original
,
as
I
take
*NL*
it
that
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Tristram
,
``
I
suppose
I
am
original
;
like
all
those
immoral
*NL*
pictures
in
the
Louvre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
Newman
continued
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
work
at
pleasure
,
any
*NL*
more
than
I
played
at
work
.
I
want
to
take
it
easily
.
I
feel
deliciously
*NL*
lazy
,
and
I
should
like
to
spend
six
months
as
I
am
now
,
sitting
under
*NL*
a
tree
and
listening
to
a
band
.
There
's
only
one
thing
;
I
want
to
hear
*NL*
some
good
music

*NL*
*NL*
``

can
find
something
better
for
*NL*
you
to
do
than
to
sit
under

tree

begin
with

``
The
Occidental

Of

*NL*
``

Newman
,
with
energy
,

*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
sitting
sidewise
in
his
chair
,
with
his
elbow
on
the
back
and
*NL*
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand

Without
moving
he
looked
a
while
at
his
*NL*
companion
with
his
dry
,
guarded
,
half-inscrutable
,
and
yet
altogether
*NL*
good-natured
smile
.
``

he
said
at
last

Tristram
bounced
about
in
his
chair
.
``

Tristram
seemed
restless

suspicious
;
he
eyed
his

askance

*NL*
and
then
,
``

up

he
demanded

*NL*
Christopher
Newman
twisted
one
end
of
his
mustache
a
while
,
in
silence
,
*NL*
and
at
last
he
made
answer
.
``
One
day
,
a
couple
of
months
ago
,
something
*NL*
very
curious
happened
to
me

I
had
come
on
to
New
York
on
some
important
*NL*
business
;
it
was
rather
a
long
story
--
a
question
of
getting
ahead
of
*NL*
another
party
,
in
a
certain
particular
way
,
in
the
stock-market
.
This
*NL*
other
party
had
once
played
me
a
very
mean
trick
.
I
owed
him
a
grudge
,
I
*NL*
felt
awfully
savage
at
the
time
,
and
I
vowed
that
,
when
I
got
a
chance
,
*NL*
I
would
,
figuratively
speaking
,
put
his
nose
out
of
joint
.
There
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
some
sixty
thousand
dollars
at
stake
.
If
I
put
it
out
of
his
*NL*
way
,
it
was
a
blow
the
fellow
would
feel
,
and
he
really
deserved
no
*NL*
quarter
.
I
jumped
into
a
hack
and
went
about
my
business
,
and
it
was
*NL*
in
this
hack
--
this
immortal
,
historical
hack
--
that
the
curious
thing
I
*NL*
speak
of
occurred
.
It
was
a
hack
like
any
other
,
only
a
trifle
dirtier
,
*NL*
with
a
greasy
line
along
the
top
of
the
drab
cushions
,
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
used
for
a
great
many
Irish
funerals
.
It
is
possible
I
took
a
nap
;
I
*NL*
had
been
traveling
all
night
,
and
though
I
was
excited
with
my
errand
,
*NL*
I
felt
the
want
of
sleep
.
At
all
events
I
woke
up
suddenly
,
from
a
sleep
*NL*
or
from
a
kind
of
a
reverie
,
with
the
most
extraordinary
feeling
in
the
*NL*
world
--
a
mortal
disgust
for
the
thing
I
was
going
to
do
.
It
came
upon
*NL*
me
like
THAT
!
''
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
--
``
as
abruptly
as
an
old
wound
*NL*
that
begins
to
ache
.
I
could
n't
tell
the
meaning
of
it
;
I
only
felt
that
*NL*
I
loathed
the
whole
business
and
wanted
to
wash
my
hands
of
it
.
The
idea
*NL*
of
losing
that
sixty
thousand
dollars
,
of
letting
it
utterly
slide
and
*NL*
scuttle
and
never
hearing
of
it
again
,
seemed
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
.
And
all
this
took
place
quite
independently
of
my
will
,
and
I
sat
*NL*
watching
it
as
if
it
were
a
play
at
the
theatre
.
I
could
feel
it
going
*NL*
on
inside
of
me
.
You
may
depend
upon
it
that
there
are
things
going
on
*NL*
inside
of
us
that
we
understand
mighty
little
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jupiter
!
you
make
my
flesh
creep
!
''
cried
Tristram
.
``
And
while
you
sat
*NL*
in
your
hack
,
watching
the
play
,
as
you
call
it
,
the
other
man
marched
*NL*
in
and
bagged
your
sixty
thousand
dollars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the
least
idea
.
I
hope
so
,
poor
devil
!
but
I
never
found
*NL*
out
.
We
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
place
I
was
going
to
in
Wall
Street
,
*NL*
but
I
sat
still
in
the
carriage
,
and
at
last
the
driver
scrambled
down
*NL*
off
his
seat
to
see
whether
his
carriage
had
not
turned
into
a
hearse
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
have
got
out
,
any
more
than
if
I
had
been
a
corpse
.
What
was
*NL*
the
matter
with
me
?
Momentary
idiocy
,
you
'll
say
.
What
I
wanted
to
get
*NL*
out
of
was
Wall
Street
.
I
told
the
man
to
drive
down
to
the
Brooklyn
*NL*
ferry
and
to
cross
over
.
When
we
were
over
,
I
told
him
to
drive
me
out
*NL*
into
the
country
.
As
I
had
told
him
originally
to
drive
for
dear
life
*NL*
down
town
,
I
suppose
he
thought
me
insane
.
Perhaps
I
was
,
but
in
that
*NL*
case
I
am
insane
still
.
I
spent
the
morning
looking
at
the
first
green
*NL*
leaves
on
Long
Island
.
I
was
sick
of
business
;
I
wanted
to
throw
it
all
*NL*
up
and
break
off
short
;
I
had
money
enough
,
or
if
I
had
n't
I
ought
to
*NL*
have
.
I
seemed
to
feel
a
new
man
inside
my
old
skin
,
and
I
longed
for
*NL*
a
new
world
.
When
you
want
a
thing
so
very
badly
you
had
better
treat
*NL*
yourself
to
it
.
I
did
n't
understand
the
matter
,
not
in
the
least
;
but
*NL*
I
gave
the
old
horse
the
bridle
and
let
him
find
his
way
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
could
get
out
of
the
game
I
sailed
for
Europe
.
That
is
how
I
come
to
be
*NL*
sitting
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
bought
up
that
hack
,
''
said
Tristram
;
``
it
is
n't
a
*NL*
safe
vehicle
to
have
about
.
And
you
have
really
sold
out
,
then
;
you
have
*NL*
retired
from
business
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
over
my
hand
to
a
friend
;
when
I
feel
disposed
,
I
can
take
*NL*
up
the
cards
again
.
I
dare
say
that
a
twelvemonth
hence
the
operation
*NL*
will
be
reversed
.
The
pendulum
will
swing
back
again
.
I
shall
be
sitting
*NL*
in
a
gondola
or
on
a
dromedary
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
shall
want
*NL*
to
clear
out
.
But
for
the
present
I
am
perfectly
free
.
I
have
even
*NL*
bargained
that
I
am
to
receive
no
business
letters

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it

a
real

Tristram

Newman

,
with

easy
smile
,

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
performed
this
ceremony
on
the
following
day
,
when
,
by
appointment
,
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
went
to
dine
with
him
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Tristram
lived
*NL*
behind
one
of
those
chalk-colored
facades
which
decorate
with
their
*NL*
pompous
sameness
the
broad
avenues
manufactured
by
Baron
Haussmann
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
of
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
.
Their
apartment
was
rich
in
the
*NL*
modern
conveniences
,
and
Tristram
lost
no
time
in
calling
his
visitor
's
*NL*
attention
to
their
principal
household
treasures
,
the
gas-lamps
and
the
*NL*
furnace-holes
.
``
Whenever
you
feel
homesick
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
come
up
*NL*
here
.
We
'll
stick
you
down
before
a
register
,
under
a
good
big
burner
,
*NL*
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
soon
get
over
your
homesickness
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
stared
;
his
wife
often
had
a
tone
which
he
found
inscrutable
*NL*
he
could
not
tell
for
his
life
whether
she
was
in
jest
or
in
earnest
.
*NL*
The
truth
is
that
circumstances
had
done
much
to
cultivate
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
a
marked
tendency
to
irony
.
Her
taste
on
many
points
differed
*NL*
from
that
of
her
husband
,
and
though
she
made
frequent
concessions
it
*NL*
must
be
confessed
that
her
concessions
were
not
always
graceful
.
They
*NL*
were
founded
upon
a
vague
project
she
had
of
some
day
doing
something
*NL*
very
positive
,
something
a
trifle
passionate
.
What
she
meant
to
do
she
*NL*
could
by
no
means
have
told
you
;
but
meanwhile
,
nevertheless
,
she
was
*NL*
buying
a
good
conscience
,
by
installments
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
should
be
added
,
without
delay
,
to
anticipate
misconception
,
that
her
*NL*
little
scheme
of
independence
did
not
definitely
involve
the
assistance
*NL*
of
another
person
,
of
the
opposite
sex
;
she
was
not
saving
up
virtue
to
*NL*
cover
the
expenses
of
a
flirtation
.
For
this
there
were
various
reasons
.
*NL*
To
begin
with
,
she
had
a
very
plain
face
and
she
was
entirely
without
*NL*
illusions
as
to
her
appearance
.
She
had
taken
its
measure
to
a
hair
's
*NL*
breadth
,
she
knew
the
worst
and
the
best
,
she
had
accepted
herself
.
It
*NL*
had
not
been
,
indeed
,
without
a
struggle
.
As
a
young
girl
she
had
spent
*NL*
hours
with
her
back
to
her
mirror
,
crying
her
eyes
out
;
and
later
*NL*
she
had
from
desperation
and
bravado
adopted
the
habit
of
proclaiming
*NL*
herself
the
most
ill-favored
of
women
,
in
order
that
she
might
--
as
in
*NL*
common
politeness
was
inevitable
--
be
contradicted
and
reassured
.
It
*NL*
was
since
she
had
come
to
live
in
Europe
that
she
had
begun
to
take
the
*NL*
matter
philosophically
.
Her
observation
,
acutely
exercised
here
,
had
*NL*
suggested
to
her
that
a
woman
's
first
duty
is
not
to
be
beautiful
,
but
*NL*
to
be
pleasing
,
and
she
encountered
so
many
women
who
pleased
without
*NL*
beauty
that
she
began
to
feel
that
she
had
discovered
her
mission
.
She
*NL*
had
once
heard
an
enthusiastic
musician
,
out
of
patience
with
a
gifted
*NL*
bungler
,
declare
that
a
fine
voice
is
really
an
obstacle
to
singing
*NL*
properly
;
and
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
might
perhaps
be
equally
true
*NL*
that
a
beautiful
face
is
an
obstacle
to
the
acquisition
of
charming
*NL*
manners
.
Mrs.
Tristram
,
then
,
undertook
to
be
exquisitely
agreeable
,
and
*NL*
she
brought
to
the
task
a
really
touching
devotion
.
How
well
she
would
*NL*
have
succeeded
I
am
unable
to
say
;
unfortunately
she
broke
off
in
the
*NL*
middle
.
Her
own
excuse
was
the
want
of
encouragement
in
her
immediate
*NL*
circle
.
But
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
she
had
not
a
real
genius
for
*NL*
the
matter
,
or
she
would
have
pursued
the
charming
art
for
itself
.
The
*NL*
poor
lady
was
very
incomplete
.
She
fell
back
upon
the
harmonies
of
the
*NL*
toilet
,
which
she
thoroughly
understood
,
and
contented
herself
with
*NL*
dressing
in
perfection
.
She
lived
in
Paris
,
which
she
pretended
to
*NL*
detest
,
because
it
was
only
in
Paris
that
one
could
find
things
to
*NL*
exactly
suit
one
's
complexion
.
Besides
out
of
Paris
it
was
always
more
*NL*
or
less
of
a
trouble
to
get
ten-button
gloves
.
When
she
railed
at
this
*NL*
serviceable
city
and
you
asked
her
where
she
would
prefer
to
reside
,
she
*NL*
returned
some
very
unexpected
answer
.
She
would
say
in
Copenhagen
,
or
*NL*
in
Barcelona
;
having
,
while
making
the
tour
of
Europe
,
spent
a
couple
*NL*
of
days
at
each
of
these
places
.
On
the
whole
,
with
her
poetic
furbelows
*NL*
and
her
misshapen
,
intelligent
little
face
,
she
was
,
when
you
knew
her
,
*NL*
a
decidedly
interesting
woman
.
She
was
naturally
shy
,
and
if
she
had
*NL*
been
born
a
beauty
,
she
would
-LRB-
having
no
vanity
-RRB-
probably
have
remained
*NL*
shy
.
Now
,
she
was
both
diffident
and
importunate
;
extremely
reserved
*NL*
sometimes
with
her
friends
,
and
strangely
expansive
with
strangers
.
She
*NL*
despised
her
husband
;
despised
him
too
much
,
for
she
had
been
perfectly
*NL*
at
liberty
not
to
marry
him
.
She
had
been
in
love
with
a
clever
man
*NL*
who
had
slighted
her
,
and
she
had
married
a
fool
in
the
hope
that
*NL*
this
thankless
wit
,
reflecting
on
it
,
would
conclude
that
she
had
no
*NL*
appreciation
of
merit
,
and
that
he
had
flattered
himself
in
supposing
*NL*
that
she
cared
for
his
own
.
Restless
,
discontented
,
visionary
,
without
*NL*
personal
ambitions
,
but
with
a
certain
avidity
of
imagination
,
she
was
,
*NL*
as
I
have
said
before
,
eminently
incomplete
.
She
was
full
--
both
for
*NL*
good
and
for
ill
--
of
beginnings
that
came
to
nothing
;
but
she
had
*NL*
nevertheless
,
morally
,
a
spark
of
the
sacred
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
fond
,
under
all
circumstances
,
of
the
society
of
women
,
and
*NL*
now
that
he
was
out
of
his
native
element
and
deprived
of
his
habitual
*NL*
interests
,
he
turned
to
it
for
compensation
.
He
took
a
great
fancy
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
;
she
frankly
repaid
it
,
and
after
their
first
meeting
he
*NL*
passed
a
great
many
hours
in
her
drawing-room
.
After
two
or
three
talks
*NL*
they
were
fast
friends
.
Newman
's
manner
with
women
was
peculiar
,
and
*NL*
it
required
some
ingenuity
on
a
lady
's
part
to
discover
that
he
*NL*
admired
her
.
He
had
no
gallantry
,
in
the
usual
sense
of
the
term
;
*NL*
no
compliments
,
no
graces
,
no
speeches
.
Very
fond
of
what
is
called
*NL*
chaffing
,
in
his
dealings
with
men
,
he
never
found
himself
on
a
sofa
*NL*
beside
a
member
of
the
softer
sex
without
feeling
extremely
serious
.
*NL*
He
was
not
shy
,
and
so
far
as
awkwardness
proceeds
from
a
struggle
with
*NL*
shyness
,
he
was
not
awkward
;
grave
,
attentive
,
submissive
,
often
silent
,
*NL*
he
was
simply
swimming
in
a
sort
of
rapture
of
respect
.
This
emotion
was
*NL*
not
at
all
theoretic
,
it
was
not
even
in
a
high
degree
sentimental
;
he
*NL*
had
thought
very
little
about
the
``
position
''
of
women
,
and
he
was
*NL*
not
familiar
either
sympathetically
or
otherwise
,
with
the
image
of
*NL*
a
President
in
petticoats
.
His
attitude
was
simply
the
flower
of
*NL*
his
general
good-nature
,
and
a
part
of
his
instinctive
and
genuinely
*NL*
democratic
assumption
of
every
one
's
right
to
lead
an
easy
life
.
If
a
*NL*
shaggy
pauper
had
a
right
to
bed
and
board
and
wages
and
a
vote
,
women
,
*NL*
of
course
,
who
were
weaker
than
paupers
,
and
whose
physical
tissue
was
*NL*
in
itself
an
appeal
,
should
be
maintained
,
sentimentally
,
at
the
public
*NL*
expense
.
Newman
was
willing
to
be
taxed
for
this
purpose
,
largely
,
in
*NL*
proportion
to
his
means
.
Moreover
,
many
of
the
common
traditions
with
*NL*
regard
to
women
were
with
him
fresh
personal
impressions
;
he
had
never
*NL*
read
a
novel
!
He
had
been
struck
with
their
acuteness
,
their
subtlety
,
*NL*
their
tact
,
their
felicity
of
judgment
.
They
seemed
to
him
exquisitely
*NL*
organized
.
If
it
is
true
that
one
must
always
have
in
one
's
work
here
*NL*
below
a
religion
,
or
at
least
an
ideal
,
of
some
sort
,
Newman
found
his
*NL*
metaphysical
inspiration
in
a
vague
acceptance
of
final
responsibility
*NL*
to
some
illumined
feminine
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
in
listening
to
advice
from
Mrs.
Tristram
;
*NL*
advice
,
it
must
be
added
,
for
which
he
had
never
asked
.
He
would
*NL*
have
been
incapable
of
asking
for
it
,
for
he
had
no
perception
of
*NL*
difficulties
,
and
consequently
no
curiosity
about
remedies
.
The
complex
*NL*
Parisian
world
about
him
seemed
a
very
simple
affair
;
it
was
an
immense
,
*NL*
amazing
spectacle
,
but
it
neither
inflamed
his
imagination
nor
*NL*
irritated
his
curiosity
.
He
kept
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looked
on
*NL*
good-humoredly
,
desired
to
miss
nothing
important
,
observed
a
great
many
*NL*
things
narrowly
,
and
never
reverted
to
himself
.
Mrs.
Tristram
's
``
advice
''
*NL*
was
a
part
of
the
show
,
and
a
more
entertaining
element
,
in
her
abundant
*NL*
gossip
,
than
the
others
.
He
enjoyed
her
talking
about
himself
;
it
seemed
*NL*
a
part
of
her
beautiful
ingenuity
;
but
he
never
made
an
application
*NL*
of
anything
she
said
,
or
remembered
it
when
he
was
away
from
her
.
For
*NL*
herself
,
she
appropriated
him
;
he
was
the
most
interesting
thing
she
*NL*
had
had
to
think
about
in
many
a
month
.
She
wished
to
do
something
with
*NL*
him
--
she
hardly
knew
what
.
There
was
so
much
of
him
;
he
was
so
rich
*NL*
and
robust
,
so
easy
,
friendly
,
well-disposed
,
that
he
kept
her
fancy
*NL*
constantly
on
the
alert
.
For
the
present
,
the
only
thing
she
could
do
*NL*
was
to
like
him
.
She
told
him
that
he
was
``
horribly
Western
,
''
but
in
*NL*
this
compliment
the
adverb
was
tinged
with
insincerity
.
She
led
him
*NL*
about
with
her
,
introduced
him
to
fifty
people
,
and
took
extreme
*NL*
satisfaction
in
her
conquest
.
Newman
accepted
every
proposal
,
shook
*NL*
hands
universally
and
promiscuously
,
and
seemed
equally
unfamiliar
*NL*
with
trepidation
or
with
elation
.
Tom
Tristram
complained
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
avidity
,
and
declared
that
he
could
never
have
a
clear
five
minutes
with
*NL*
his
friend
.
If
he
had
known
how
things
were
going
to
turn
out
,
he
never
*NL*
would
have
brought
him
to
the
Avenue
d'Iena
.
The
two
men
,
formerly
,
had
*NL*
not
been
intimate
,
but
Newman
remembered
his
earlier
impression
of
his
*NL*
host
,
and
did
Mrs.
Tristram
,
who
had
by
no
means
taken
him
into
her
*NL*
confidence
,
but
whose
secret
he
presently
discovered
,
the
justice
to
*NL*
admit
that
her
husband
was
a
rather
degenerate
mortal
.
At
twenty-five
he
*NL*
had
been
a
good
fellow
,
and
in
this
respect
he
was
unchanged
;
but
of
a
*NL*
man
of
his
age
one
expected
something
more
.
People
said
he
was
sociable
,
*NL*
but
this
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
for
a
dipped
sponge
to
*NL*
expand
;
and
it
was
not
a
high
order
of
sociability
.
He
was
a
great
*NL*
gossip
and
tattler
,
and
to
produce
a
laugh
would
hardly
have
spared
the
*NL*
reputation
of
his
aged
mother
.
Newman
had
a
kindness
for
old
memories
,
*NL*
but
he
found
it
impossible
not
to
perceive
that
Tristram
was
nowadays
*NL*
a
very
light
weight
.
His
only
aspirations
were
to
hold
out
at
poker
,
*NL*
at
his
club
,
to
know
the
names
of
all
the
cocottes
,
to
shake
hands
all
*NL*
round
,
to
ply
his
rosy
gullet
with
truffles
and
champagne
,
and
to
create
*NL*
uncomfortable
eddies
and
obstructions
among
the
constituent
atoms
of
the
*NL*
American
colony
.
He
was
shamefully
idle
,
spiritless
,
sensual
,
snobbish
.
*NL*
He
irritated
our
friend
by
the
tone
of
his
allusions
to
their
native
*NL*
country
,
and
Newman
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
the
United
States
*NL*
were
not
good
enough
for
Mr.
Tristram
.
He
had
never
been
a
very
*NL*
conscious
patriot
,
but
it
vexed
him
to
see
them
treated
as
little
better
*NL*
than
a
vulgar
smell
in
his
friend
's
nostrils
,
and
he
finally
broke
out
*NL*
and
swore
that
they
were
the
greatest
country
in
the
world
,
that
they
*NL*
could
put
all
Europe
into
their
breeches
'
pockets
,
and
that
an
American
*NL*
who
spoke
ill
of
them
ought
to
be
carried
home
in
irons
and
compelled
*NL*
to
live
in
Boston
.
-LRB-
This
,
for
Newman
was
putting
it
very
vindictively
.
-RRB-
*NL*
Tristram
was
a
comfortable
man
to
snub
,
he
bore
no
malice
,
and
he
*NL*
continued
to
insist
on
Newman
's
finishing
his
evening
at
the
Occidental
*NL*
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
dined
several
times
in
the
Avenue
d'Iena
,
and
his
*NL*
host
always
proposed
an
early
adjournment
to
this
institution
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
protested
,
and
declared
that
her
husband
exhausted
his
*NL*
ingenuity
in
trying
to
displease
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
never
try
,
my
love
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
know
you
loathe
me
quite
*NL*
enough
when
I
take
my
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
hated
to
see
a
husband
and
wife
on
these
terms
,
and
he
was
sure
*NL*
one
or
other
of
them
must
be
very
unhappy
.
He
knew
it
was
not
Tristram
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
had
a
balcony
before
her
windows
,
upon
which
,
during
the
*NL*
June
evenings
,
she
was
fond
of
sitting
,
and
Newman
used
frankly
to
say
*NL*
that
he
preferred
the
balcony
to
the
club
.
It
had
a
fringe
of
perfumed
*NL*
plants
in
tubs
,
and
enabled
you
to
look
up
the
broad
street
and
see
*NL*
the
Arch
of
Triumph
vaguely
massing
its
heroic
sculptures
in
the
summer
*NL*
starlight
.
Sometimes
Newman
kept
his
promise
of
following
Mr.
Tristram
,
*NL*
in
half
an
hour
,
to
the
Occidental
,
and
sometimes
he
forgot
it
.
His
*NL*
hostess
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
about
himself
,
but
on
this
*NL*
subject
he
was
an
indifferent
talker
.
He
was
not
what
is
called
*NL*
subjective
,
though
when
he
felt
that
her
interest
was
sincere
,
he
made
*NL*
an
almost
heroic
attempt
to
be
.
He
told
her
a
great
many
things
he
*NL*
had
done
,
and
regaled
her
with
anecdotes
of
Western
life
;
she
was
from
*NL*
Philadelphia
,
and
with
her
eight
years
in
Paris
,
talked
of
herself
as
a
*NL*
languid
Oriental
.
But
some
other
person
was
always
the
hero
of
the
tale
,
*NL*
by
no
means
always
to
his
advantage
;
and
Newman
's
own
emotions
were
but
*NL*
scantily
chronicled
.
She
had
an
especial
wish
to
know
whether
he
had
*NL*
ever
been
in
love
--
seriously
,
passionately
--
and
,
failing
to
gather
*NL*
any
satisfaction
from
his
allusions
,
she
at
last
directly
inquired
.
He
*NL*
hesitated
a
while
,
and
at
last
he
said
,
``
No
!
''
She
declared
that
she
was
*NL*
delighted
to
hear
it
,
as
it
confirmed
her
private
conviction
that
he
was
*NL*
a
man
of
no
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
he
asked
,
very
gravely
.
``
Do
you
think
so
?
How
do
you
recognize
*NL*
a
man
of
feeling
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
out
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
whether
you
are
very
simple
or
*NL*
very
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
deep
.
That
's
a
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
that
if
I
were
to
tell
you
with
a
certain
air
that
you
have
*NL*
no
feeling
,
you
would
implicitly
believe
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
certain
air
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
Try
it
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
believe
me
,
but
you
would
not
care

said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
got
it
all
wrong
.
I
should
care
immensely
,
but
I
should
n't
*NL*
believe
you
.
The
fact
is
I
have
never
had
time
to
feel
things
.
I
have
*NL*
had
to
DO
them
,
to
make
myself
felt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
imagine
that
you
may
have
done
that
tremendously
,
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
no
mistake
about
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
are
in
a
fury

*NL*
``
I
am

in

*NL*
``
Angry

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
never
angry

it

so
long
since
I
have

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
that

be
angry
sometimes

you
are
neither

enough
nor
bad
*NL*
enough
always
to
keep
your
temper

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lose
it
perhaps
once
in
five
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

round

said
his
hostess
.
``
Before
I

you
six
months
I
shall
see
you
in

*NL*
``
Do
you

*NL*
``

You
have
what

thing
in

the
consciousness
of
having
bought
your
pleasure

paid
for
it

You

not
a

of
reckoning
staring
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
suppose

Newman
,
meditatively
.

*NL*
``
You

Successful

Newman

Newman

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
does

Mrs.

answered

Then
in
a

moment
,
``
Besides

*NL*
``

added
in

moment

*NL*
``

Mrs.

Newman

*NL*
she
said
,
at

.
``
I
should
like
to
put
you
in
a
difficult
place

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
a

conceited
sound

his
companion
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
put
it
to
the

And
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
remained
silent
for
some
time
afterwards
,
as
if
she
was
trying
*NL*
to
keep
her
pledge
.
It
did
not
appear
that
evening
that
she
succeeded
;
*NL*
but
as
he
was
rising
to
take
his
leave
she
passed
suddenly
,
as
she
was
*NL*
very
apt
to
do
,
from
the
tone
of
unsparing
persiflage
to
that
of
almost
*NL*
tremulous
sympathy
.
``
Speaking
seriously
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
believe
in
you
,
*NL*
Mr.
Newman
.
You
flatter
my
patriotism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
patriotism
?
''
Christopher
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
.
It
would
take
too
long
to
explain
,
and
you
probably
would
not
*NL*
understand

Besides
,
you
might
take
it
--
really
,
you
might
take
it
for
a
*NL*
declaration
.
But
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
personally
;
it
's
what
you
*NL*
represent
.
Fortunately
you
do
n't
know
all
that
,
or
your
conceit
would
*NL*
increase
insufferably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stood
staring
and
wondering
what
under
the
sun
he
``
represented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
all
my
meddlesome
chatter
and
forget
my
advice

It
is
*NL*
very
silly
in
me

tell
you
what
to
do
.
When
you
are
*NL*
embarrassed
,
do
as
you
think
best
,
and
you
will
do
very
well

When
you
*NL*
are
in
a
difficulty
,
judge
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
remember
everything
you
have
told
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
There
are
*NL*
so
many
forms
and
ceremonies
over
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forms
and
ceremonies
are
what
I
mean

of
course

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
want
to
observe
them
,

said
Newman
.
``
Have
n't
I
as
good
a
*NL*
right
as
another

They
do
n't
scare
me
,

you
need
n't
give
me
leave
to
*NL*
violate
them
.
I
wo
n't
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
what
I

*NL*
``
Oh

I
am
sure
I
shall
never

Newman

*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
that
he
dined
in
the
Avenue
d'Iena
was
a
Sunday
,
a
day
on
*NL*
which
Mr.
Tristram
left
the
cards
unshuffled
,
so
that
there
was
a
trio
*NL*
in
the
evening
on
the
balcony
.
The
talk
was
of
many
things
,
and
at
last
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
suddenly
observed
to
Christopher
Newman
that
it
was
high
*NL*
time
he
should
take
a
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
her
;
she
has
the
audacity
!
''
said
Tristram
,
who
on
Sunday
*NL*
evenings
was
always
rather
acrimonious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
you
have
made
up
your
mind
not
to
marry
?
''
Mrs.
Tristram
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forbid
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
I
am
sternly
resolved
on
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
easy

''
said
Tristram
;
``
fatally
easy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
wait
till
you
are
fifty

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
in
a
great
hurry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
never

it

come
and
propose
to
*NL*
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
am
willing

I

a

about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
some
of
your
thoughts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Newman
,
slowly

``
I
want
to
marry
very
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry

Tristram

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
every
sense

I
shall
be
hard

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
remember

what
she

*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
ask

Newman
,

I
will
say
frankly
that
I

It

I

*NL*
``
Voila

cried
Mrs.

Newman
rejoined

off

laugh
at

*NL*

I

said
Mrs.

*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
while

Well

he
said
,
at

,
``
I
want
a
great
*NL*

I
stick
to
that

That

one
thing
I
CAN
treat
myself
to
,
and
if
*NL*
it
is
to
be
had
I
mean
to
have
it

What
else
have
I
toiled
and
struggled

for

all
these
years

I
have
succeeded

now
what
am
I
to
do
with
*NL*
my
success

To
make
it
perfect
,
as
I
see
it

there
must
be
a
beautiful
*NL*
woman
perched
on
the
pile

like
a
statue
on

monument

She
must
be
as
*NL*
good

she
is
beautiful

as
clever
as
she
is
good
.
I
can
give
my
*NL*
wife
a
good
deal

so
I
am
not
afraid
to
ask
a
good
deal
myself

She

have
everything
a

desire

object
to

her
being

may
be
cleverer

wiser

I
can

understand

I
shall
only
be
the
better
pleased

I
want

possess

in
a

,
the
best
article
in
the
market

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
a
fellow
all
this
at
the
outset

Tristram

demanded

I
have
been
trying
so
to
make
you
fond

ME

This
is
very
interesting

I

a
man

know
his
own
mind

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
known
mine
for
a
long
time

Newman
went
on

I
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
tolerably
early
in

that
a
beautiful

was
the
thing
best
worth

having
,
here
below

It
is
the
greatest
victory
over
circumstances

I

beautiful

I
mean
beautiful
in
mind

in
manners

as
well

It
is
a
thing
every
man
has
an
equal
right

he
may
get
it
if

he
can

He
does

have
to
be
born
with
certain
faculties

on
purpose

*NL*
he
needs
only
to
be
a
man

Then
he
needs
only
to
use
his
will

such

wits
as
he
has

to
try

with

knee

?
She
was
married
at
eighteen
,
by
her
parents
,
in
*NL*
the
French
fashion
,
to
a
disagreeable
old
man
.
But
he
had
the
good
taste
*NL*
to
die
a
couple
of
years
afterward
,
and
she
is
now
twenty-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
is
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
French
by
her
father
,
English
by
her
mother
.
She
is
really
more
English
*NL*
than
French
,
and
she
speaks
English
as
well
as
you
or
I
--
or
rather
much
*NL*
better
.
She
belongs
to
the
very
top
of
the
basket
,
as
they
say
here
.
*NL*
Her
family
,
on
each
side
,
is
of
fabulous
antiquity
;
her
mother
is
the
*NL*
daughter
of
an
English
Catholic
earl
.
Her
father
is
dead
,
and
since
her
*NL*
widowhood
she
has
lived
with
her
mother
and
a
married
brother
.
There
is
*NL*
another
brother
,
younger
,
who
I
believe
is
wild
.
They
have
an
old
hotel
*NL*
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
,
but
their
fortune
is
small
,
and
they
make
a
*NL*
common
household
,
for
economy
's
sake
.
When
I
was
a
girl
I
was
put
into
a
*NL*
convent
here
for
my
education
,
while
my
father
made
the
tour
of
Europe
.
*NL*
It
was
a
silly
thing
to
do
with
me
,
but
it
had
the
advantage
that
it
*NL*
made
me
acquainted
with
Claire
de
Bellegarde
.
She
was
younger
than
I
*NL*
but
we
became
fast
friends
.
I
took
a
tremendous
fancy
to
her
,
and
she
*NL*
returned
my
passion
as
far
as
she
could
.
They
kept
such
a
tight
rein
on
*NL*
her
that
she
could
do
very
little
,
and
when
I
left
the
convent
she
had
*NL*
to
give
me
up
.
I
was
not
of
her
monde
;
I
am
not
now
,
either
,
but
we
*NL*
sometimes
meet
.
They
are
terrible
people
--
her
monde
;
all
mounted
upon
*NL*
stilts
a
mile
high
,
and
with
pedigrees
long
in
proportion
.
It
is
the
*NL*
skim
of
the
milk
of
the
old
noblesse
.
Do
you
know
what
a
Legitimist
*NL*
is
,
or
an
Ultramontane
?
Go
into
Madame
de
Cintre
's
drawing-room
*NL*
some
afternoon
,
at
five
o'clock
,
and
you
will
see
the
best
preserved
*NL*
specimens
.
I
say
go
,
but
no
one
is
admitted
who
ca
n't
show
his
fifty
*NL*
quarterings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
lady
you
propose
to
me
to
marry
?
''
asked
Newman
.
``
A
lady
*NL*
I
ca
n't
even
approach
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
just
now
that
you
recognized
no
obstacles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
Mrs.
Tristram
a
while
,
stroking
his
mustache
.
``
Is
she
a
*NL*
beauty
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
it
's
no
use
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
a
beauty
,
but
she
is
beautiful
,
two
very
different
things
.
A
*NL*
beauty
has
no
faults
in
her
face
,
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
may
have
*NL*
faults
that
only
deepen
its
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
Madame
de
Cintre
,
now
,
''
said
Tristram
.
``
She
is
as
plain
as
a
*NL*
pike-staff
.
A
man
would
n't
look
at
her
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
saying
that
HE
would
not
look
at
her
twice
,
my
husband
sufficiently
*NL*
describes
her
,
''
Mrs.
Tristram
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
good
;
is
she
clever
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
perfect
!
I
wo
n't
say
more
than
that
.
When
you
are
praising
*NL*
a
person
to
another
who
is
to
know
her
,
it
is
bad
policy
to
go
into
*NL*
details
.
I
wo
n't
exaggerate
.
I
simply
recommend
her
.
Among
all
women
I
*NL*
have
known
she
stands
alone
;
she
is
of
a
different
clay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
her
,
''
said
Newman
,
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
manage
it
.
The
only
way
will
be
to
invite
her
to
dinner
.
*NL*
I
have
never
invited
her
before
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
she
will
come
.
*NL*
Her
old
feudal
countess
of
a
mother
rules
the
family
with
an
iron
hand
,
*NL*
and
allows
her
to
have
no
friends
but
of
her
own
choosing
,
and
to
visit
*NL*
only
in
a
certain
sacred
circle
.
But
I
can
at
least
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Mrs.
Tristram
was
interrupted
;
a
servant
stepped
out
upon
*NL*
the
balcony
and
announced
that
there
were
visitors
in
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
When
Newman
's
hostess
had
gone
in
to
receive
her
friends
,
Tom
Tristram
*NL*
approached
his
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
your
foot
into
THIS
,
my
boy
,
''
he
said
,
puffing
the
last
*NL*
whiffs
of
his
cigar
.
``
There
's
nothing
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
askance
at
him
,
inquisitive
.
``
You
tell
another
story
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
simply
that
Madame
de
Cintre
is
a
great
white
doll
of
a
woman
,
*NL*
who
cultivates
quiet
haughtiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
's
haughty
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looks
at
you
as
if
you
were
so
much
thin
air
,
and
cares
for
you
*NL*
about
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
proud
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Proud
?
As
proud
as
I
'm
humble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
good-looking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tristram
shrugged
his
shoulders
:
``
It
's
a
kind
of
beauty
you
must
be
*NL*
INTELLECTUAL
to
understand
.
But
I
must
go
in
and
amuse
the
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
elapsed
before
Newman
followed
his
friends
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
When
he
at
last
made
his
appearance
there
he
remained
but
*NL*
a
short
time
,
and
during
this
period
sat
perfectly
silent
,
listening
*NL*
to
a
lady
to
whom
Mrs.
Tristram
had
straightway
introduced
him
and
who
*NL*
chattered
,
without
a
pause
,
with
the
full
force
of
an
extraordinarily
*NL*
high-pitched
voice
.
Newman
gazed
and
attended
.
Presently
he
came
to
bid
*NL*
good-night
to
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
lady
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Dora
Finch
.
How
do
you
like
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
too
noisy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
thought
so
bright
!
Certainly
,
you
are
fastidious
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stood
a
moment
,
hesitating
.
Then
at
last
``
Do
n't
forget
about
your
*NL*
friend
,
''
he
said
,
``
Madame
What
's
-
her-name
?
the
proud
beauty
.
Ask
her
to
*NL*
dinner
,
and
give
me
a
good
notice
.
''
And
with
this
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
later
he
came
back
;
it
was
in
the
afternoon
.
He
found
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
in
her
drawing-room
;
with
her
was
a
visitor
,
a
woman
young
and
*NL*
pretty
,
dressed
in
white
.
The
two
ladies
had
risen
and
the
visitor
was
*NL*
apparently
taking
her
leave
.
As
Newman
approached
,
he
received
from
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
a
glance
of
the
most
vivid
significance
,
which
he
was
not
*NL*
immediately
able
to
interpret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
good
friend
of
ours
,
''
she
said
,
turning
to
her
companion
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Christopher
Newman
.
I
have
spoken
of
you
to
him
and
he
has
an
*NL*
extreme
desire
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
If
you
had
consented
to
come
*NL*
and
dine
,
I
should
have
offered
him
an
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
turned
her
face
toward
Newman
,
with
a
smile
.
He
was
not
*NL*
embarrassed
,
for
his
unconscious
sang-froid
was
boundless
;
but
as
he
*NL*
became
aware
that
this
was
the
proud
and
beautiful
Madame
de
Cintre
,
*NL*
the
loveliest
woman
in
the
world
,
the
promised
perfection
,
the
proposed
*NL*
ideal
,
he
made
an
instinctive
movement
to
gather
his
wits
together
.
*NL*
Through
the
slight
preoccupation
that
it
produced
he
had
a
sense
of
a
*NL*
long
,
fair
face
,
and
of
two
eyes
that
were
both
brilliant
and
mild
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
been
most
happy
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
Unfortunately
,
*NL*
as
I
have
been
telling
Mrs.
Tristram
,
I
go
on
Monday
to
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
made
a
solemn
bow
.
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paris
is
getting
too
warm
,
''
Madame
de
Cintre
added
,
taking
her
friend
's
*NL*
hand
again
in
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
seemed
to
have
formed
a
sudden
and
somewhat
venturesome
*NL*
resolution
,
and
she
smiled
more
intensely
,
as
women
do
when
they
take
*NL*
such
resolution
.
``
I
want
Mr.
Newman
to
know
you
,
''
she
said
,
dropping
her
*NL*
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
Madame
de
Cintre
's
bonnet
ribbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christopher
Newman
stood
gravely
silent
,
while
his
native
penetration
*NL*
admonished
him
.
Mrs.
Tristram
was
determined
to
force
her
friend
to
*NL*
address
him
a
word
of
encouragement
which
should
be
more
than
one
of
the
*NL*
common
formulas
of
politeness
;
and
if
she
was
prompted
by
charity
,
it
*NL*
was
by
the
charity
that
begins
at
home
.
Madame
de
Cintre
was
her
dearest
*NL*
Claire
,
and
her
especial
admiration
but
Madame
de
Cintre
had
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
dine
with
her
and
Madame
de
Cintre
should
for
once
be
*NL*
forced
gently
to
render
tribute
to
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
give
me
great
pleasure
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
great
deal
,
''
cried
the
latter
,
``
for
Madame
de
Cintre
to
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Mrs.
Tristram
can
speak
*NL*
better
for
me
than
I
can
speak
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
at
him
again
,
with
the
same
soft
brightness
.
*NL*
``
Are
you
to
be
long
in
Paris
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
keep
him
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
keeping
ME
!
''
and
Madame
de
Cintre
shook
her
friend
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moment
longer
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
at
Newman
again
;
this
time
without
her
smile
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
lingered
a
moment
.
``
Will
you
come
and
see
me
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
kissed
her
.
Newman
expressed
his
thanks
,
and
she
took
her
*NL*
leave
.
Her
hostess
went
with
her
to
the
door
,
and
left
Newman
alone
a
*NL*
moment
.
Presently
she
returned
,
rubbing
her
hands
.
``
It
was
a
fortunate
*NL*
chance
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
had
come
to
decline
my
invitation
.
You
triumphed
*NL*
on
the
spot
,
making
her
ask
you
,
at
the
end
of
three
minutes
,
to
her
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
you
who
triumphed
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
stared
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
not
strike
me
as
so
proud
.
I
should
say
she
was
shy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
discriminating
.
And
what
do
you
think
of
her
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
handsome
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
it
was
!
Of
course
you
will
go
and
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
!
''
cried
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
to-morrow
;
the
next
day
.
That
will
be
Sunday
;
she
leaves
Paris
*NL*
on
Monday
.
If
you
do
n't
see
her
;
it
will
at
least
be
a
beginning
.
''
And
*NL*
she
gave
him
Madame
de
Cintre
's
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
across
the
Seine
,
late
in
the
summer
afternoon
,
and
made
his
*NL*
way
through
those
gray
and
silent
streets
of
the
Faubourg
St.
Germain
*NL*
whose
houses
present
to
the
outer
world
a
face
as
impassive
and
as
*NL*
suggestive
of
the
concentration
of
privacy
within
as
the
blank
walls
*NL*
of
Eastern
seraglios
.
Newman
thought
it
a
queer
way
for
rich
people
*NL*
to
live
;
his
ideal
of
grandeur
was
a
splendid
facade
diffusing
its
*NL*
brilliancy
outward
too
,
irradiating
hospitality
.
The
house
to
which
he
*NL*
had
been
directed
had
a
dark
,
dusty
,
painted
portal
,
which
swung
open
*NL*
in
answer
to
his
ring
.
It
admitted
him
into
a
wide
,
graveled
court
,
*NL*
surrounded
on
three
sides
with
closed
windows
,
and
with
a
doorway
facing
*NL*
the
street
,
approached
by
three
steps
and
surmounted
by
a
tin
canopy
.
*NL*
The
place
was
all
in
the
shade
;
it
answered
to
Newman
's
conception
of
*NL*
a
convent
.
The
portress
could
not
tell
him
whether
Madame
de
Cintre
was
*NL*
visible
;
he
would
please
to
apply
at
the
farther
door
.
He
crossed
the
*NL*
court
;
a
gentleman
was
sitting
,
bareheaded
,
on
the
steps
of
the
portico
,
*NL*
playing
with
a
beautiful
pointer
.
He
rose
as
Newman
approached
,
and
,
as
*NL*
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
bell
,
said
with
a
smile
,
in
English
,
that
he
*NL*
was
afraid
Newman
would
be
kept
waiting
;
the
servants
were
scattered
,
he
*NL*
himself
had
been
ringing
,
he
did
n't
know
what
the
deuce
was
in
them
.
He
*NL*
was
a
young
man
,
his
English
was
excellent
,
and
his
smile
very
frank
.
*NL*
Newman
pronounced
the
name
of
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
``
that
my
sister
is
visible
.
Come
in
,
and
*NL*
if
you
will
give
me
your
card
I
will
carry
it
to
her
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
been
accompanied
on
his
present
errand
by
a
slight
sentiment
,
*NL*
I
will
not
say
of
defiance
--
a
readiness
for
aggression
or
defense
,
as
*NL*
they
might
prove
needful
--
but
of
reflection
,
good-humored
suspicion
.
He
*NL*
took
from
his
pocket
,
while
he
stood
on
the
portico
,
a
card
upon
which
,
*NL*
under
his
name
,
he
had
written
the
words
``
San
Francisco
,
''
and
while
*NL*
he
presented
it
he
looked
warily
at
his
interlocutor
.
His
glance
was
*NL*
singularly
reassuring
;
he
liked
the
young
man
's
face
;
it
strongly
*NL*
resembled
that
of
Madame
de
Cintre
.
He
was
evidently
her
brother
.
The
*NL*
young
man
,
on
his
side
,
had
made
a
rapid
inspection
of
Newman
's
person
.
*NL*
He
had
taken
the
card
and
was
about
to
enter
the
house
with
it
when
*NL*
another
figure
appeared
on
the
threshold
--
an
older
man
,
of
a
fine
*NL*
presence
,
wearing
evening
dress
.
He
looked
hard
at
Newman
,
and
Newman
*NL*
looked
at
him
.
``
Madame
de
Cintre
,
''
the
younger
man
repeated
,
as
an
*NL*
introduction
of
the
visitor
.
The
other
took
the
card
from
his
hand
,
*NL*
read
it
in
a
rapid
glance
,
looked
again
at
Newman
from
head
to
foot
,
*NL*
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
gravely
but
urbanely
,
``
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
is
not
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
man
made
a
gesture
,
and
then
,
turning
to
Newman
,
``
I
am
very
*NL*
sorry
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
him
a
friendly
nod
,
to
show
that
he
bore
him
no
malice
,
and
*NL*
retraced
his
steps
.
At
the
porter
's
lodge
he
stopped
;
the
two
men
were
*NL*
still
standing
on
the
portico
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
the
gentleman
with
the
dog
?
''
he
asked
of
the
old
woman
who
*NL*
reappeared
.
He
had
begun
to
learn
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Monsieur
le
Comte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Monsieur
le
Marquis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
marquis
?
''
said
Christopher
in
English
,
which
the
old
woman
*NL*
fortunately
did
not
understand
.
``
Oh
,
then
he
's
not
the
butler
!

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
one
morning
,
before
Christopher
Newman
was
dressed
,
a
little
old
*NL*
man
was
ushered
into
his
apartment
,
followed
by
a
youth
in
a
blouse
,
*NL*
bearing
a
picture
in
a
brilliant
frame
.
Newman
,
among
the
distractions
*NL*
of
Paris
,
had
forgotten
M.
Nioche
and
his
accomplished
daughter
;
but
*NL*
this
was
an
effective
reminder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
had
given
me
up
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
after
many
*NL*
apologies
and
salutations
.
``
We
have
made
you
wait
so
many
days
.
You
*NL*
accused
us
,
perhaps
,
of
inconstancy
of
bad
faith
.
But
behold
me
at
last
!
*NL*
And
behold
also
the
pretty
Madonna
.
Place
it
on
a
chair
,
my
friend
,
in
*NL*
a
good
light
,
so
that
monsieur
may
admire
it
.
''
And
M.
Nioche
,
addressing
*NL*
his
companion
,
helped
him
to
dispose
the
work
of
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
endued
with
a
layer
of
varnish
an
inch
thick
and
its
frame
,
*NL*
of
an
elaborate
pattern
,
was
at
least
a
foot
wide
.
It
glittered
and
*NL*
twinkled
in
the
morning
light
,
and
looked
,
to
Newman
's
eyes
,
wonderfully
*NL*
splendid
and
precious
.
It
seemed
to
him
a
very
happy
purchase
,
and
he
*NL*
felt
rich
in
the
possession
of
it
.
He
stood
looking
at
it
complacently
,
*NL*
while
he
proceeded
with
his
toilet
,
and
M.
Nioche
,
who
had
dismissed
his
*NL*
own
attendant
,
hovered
near
,
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
wonderful
finesse
,
''
he
murmured
,
caressingly
.
``
And
here
and
*NL*
there
are
marvelous
touches
,
you
probably
perceive
them
,
sir
.
It
*NL*
attracted
great
attention
on
the
Boulevard
,
as
we
came
along
.
And
then
a
*NL*
gradation
of
tones
!
That
's
what
it
is
to
know
how
to
paint
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
say
it
because
I
am
her
father
,
sir
;
but
as
one
man
of
taste
addressing
*NL*
another
I
can
not
help
observing
that
you
have
there
an
exquisite
work
.
*NL*
It
is
hard
to
produce
such
things
and
to
have
to
part
with
them
.
If
our
*NL*
means
only
allowed
us
the
luxury
of
keeping
it
!
I
really
may
say
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
and
M.
Nioche
gave
a
little
feebly
insinuating
laugh
--
``
I
really
may
*NL*
say
that
I
envy
you
!
You
see
,
''
he
added
in
a
moment
,
``
we
have
taken
the
*NL*
liberty
of
offering
you
a
frame
.
It
increases
by
a
trifle
the
value
of
*NL*
the
work
,
and
it
will
save
you
the
annoyance
--
so
great
for
a
person
of
*NL*
your
delicacy
--
of
going
about
to
bargain
at
the
shops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
language
spoken
by
M.
Nioche
was
a
singular
compound
,
which
I
shrink
*NL*
from
the
attempt
to
reproduce
in
its
integrity
.
He
had
apparently
once
*NL*
possessed
a
certain
knowledge
of
English
,
and
his
accent
was
oddly
*NL*
tinged
with
the
cockneyism
of
the
British
metropolis
.
But
his
learning
*NL*
had
grown
rusty
with
disuse
,
and
his
vocabulary
was
defective
and
*NL*
capricious
.
He
had
repaired
it
with
large
patches
of
French
,
with
words
*NL*
anglicized
by
a
process
of
his
own
,
and
with
native
idioms
literally
*NL*
translated
.
The
result
,
in
the
form
in
which
he
in
all
humility
*NL*
presented
it
,
would
be
scarcely
comprehensible
to
the
reader
,
so
that
I
*NL*
have
ventured
to
trim
and
sift
it
.
Newman
only
half
understood
it
,
but
*NL*
it
amused
him
,
and
the
old
man
's
decent
forlornness
appealed
to
his
*NL*
democratic
instincts
.
The
assumption
of
a
fatality
in
misery
always
*NL*
irritated
his
strong
good
nature
--
it
was
almost
the
only
thing
that
did
*NL*
so
;
and
he
felt
the
impulse
to
wipe
it
out
,
as
it
were
,
with
the
sponge
*NL*
of
his
own
prosperity
.
The
papa
of
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
however
,
had
*NL*
apparently
on
this
occasion
been
vigorously
indoctrinated
,
and
he
showed
*NL*
a
certain
tremulous
eagerness
to
cultivate
unexpected
opportunities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
I
owe
you
,
then
,
with
the
frame
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
make
in
all
three
thousand
francs
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
smiling
*NL*
agreeably
,
but
folding
his
hands
in
instinctive
suppliance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
give
me
a
receipt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
brought
one
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
.
``
I
took
the
liberty
of
drawing
it
*NL*
up
,
in
case
monsieur
should
happen
to
desire
to
discharge
his
debt
.
''
And
*NL*
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
pocket-book
and
presented
it
to
his
patron
.
*NL*
The
document
was
written
in
a
minute
,
fantastic
hand
,
and
couched
in
the
*NL*
choicest
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
laid
down
the
money
,
and
M.
Nioche
dropped
the
napoleons
one
by
*NL*
one
,
solemnly
and
lovingly
,
into
an
old
leathern
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
your
young
lady
?
''
asked
Newman
.
``
She
made
a
great
impression
*NL*
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
impression
?
Monsieur
is
very
good
.
Monsieur
admires
her
appearance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
pretty
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
yes
,
she
is
very
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
the
harm
in
her
being
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
spot
on
the
carpet
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
Then
looking
up
at
Newman
with
a
gaze
that
seemed
to
brighten
and
*NL*
expand
,
``
Monsieur
knows
what
Paris
is
.
She
is
dangerous
to
beauty
,
when
*NL*
beauty
has
n't
the
sou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
that
is
not
the
case
with
your
daughter
.
She
is
rich
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
;
we
are
rich
for
six
months
.
But
if
my
daughter
were
a
plain
*NL*
girl
I
should
sleep
better
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
of
the
young
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
and
the
old
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
to
get
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
one
does
n't
get
a
husband
for
nothing
.
Her
husband
must
*NL*
take
her
as
she
is
:
I
ca
n't
give
her
a
sou
.
But
the
young
men
do
n't
see
*NL*
with
that
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
her
talent
is
in
itself
a
dowry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
sir
,
it
needs
first
to
be
converted
into
specie
!
''
and
M.
Nioche
*NL*
slapped
his
purse
tenderly
before
he
stowed
it
away
.
``
The
operation
*NL*
does
n't
take
place
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
young
men
are
very
shabby
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
that
's
all
I
can
*NL*
say
.
They
ought
to
pay
for
your
daughter
,
and
not
ask
money
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
very
noble
ideas
,
monsieur
;
but
what
will
you
have
?
They
are
*NL*
not
the
ideas
of
this
country
.
We
want
to
know
what
we
are
about
when
we
*NL*
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
big
a
portion
does
your
daughter
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
stared
,
as
if
he
wondered
what
was
coming
next
;
but
he
*NL*
promptly
recovered
himself
,
at
a
venture
,
and
replied
that
he
knew
a
*NL*
very
nice
young
man
,
employed
by
an
insurance
company
,
who
would
content
*NL*
himself
with
fifteen
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
your
daughter
paint
half
a
dozen
pictures
for
me
,
and
she
shall
*NL*
have
her
dowry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
a
dozen
pictures
--
her
dowry
!
Monsieur
is
not
speaking
*NL*
inconsiderately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
will
make
me
six
or
eight
copies
in
the
Louvre
as
pretty
as
that
*NL*
Madonna
,
I
will
pay
her
the
same
price
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
M.
Nioche
was
speechless
a
moment
,
with
amazement
and
gratitude
,
*NL*
and
then
he
seized
Newman
's
hand
,
pressed
it
between
his
own
ten
*NL*
fingers
,
and
gazed
at
him
with
watery
eyes
.
``
As
pretty
as
that
?
They
*NL*
shall
be
a
thousand
times
prettier
--
they
shall
be
magnificent
,
sublime
.
*NL*
Ah
,
if
I
only
knew
how
to
paint
,
myself
,
sir
,
so
that
I
might
lend
a
*NL*
hand
!
What
can
I
do
to
thank
you
?
Voyons
!
''
And
he
pressed
his
forehead
*NL*
while
he
tried
to
think
of
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
have
thanked
me
enough
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
it
is
,
sir
!
''
cried
M.
Nioche
.
``
To
express
my
gratitude
,
I
will
*NL*
charge
you
nothing
for
the
lessons
in
French
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lessons
?
I
had
quite
forgotten
them
.
Listening
to
your
English
,
''
*NL*
added
Newman
,
laughing
,
``
is
almost
a
lesson
in
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
do
n't
profess
to
teach
English
,
certainly
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
.
``
But
*NL*
for
my
own
admirable
tongue
I
am
still
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
are
here
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
we
will
begin
.
This
is
a
very
*NL*
good
hour
.
I
am
going
to
have
my
coffee
;
come
every
morning
at
half-past
*NL*
nine
and
have
yours
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
offers
me
my
coffee
,
also
?
''
cried
M.
Nioche
.
``
Truly
,
my
beaux
*NL*
jours
are
coming
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
let
us
begin
.
The
coffee
is
almighty
hot
.
How
do
*NL*
you
say
that
in
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
,
then
,
for
the
following
three
weeks
,
the
minutely
respectable
*NL*
figure
of
M.
Nioche
made
its
appearance
,
with
a
series
of
little
*NL*
inquiring
and
apologetic
obeisances
,
among
the
aromatic
fumes
of
*NL*
Newman
's
morning
beverage
.
I
do
n't
know
how
much
French
our
friend
*NL*
learned
,
but
,
as
he
himself
said
,
if
the
attempt
did
him
no
good
,
it
*NL*
could
at
any
rate
do
him
no
harm
.
And
it
amused
him
;
it
gratified
that
*NL*
irregularly
sociable
side
of
his
nature
which
had
always
expressed
*NL*
itself
in
a
relish
for
ungrammatical
conversation
,
and
which
often
,
even
*NL*
in
his
busy
and
preoccupied
days
,
had
made
him
sit
on
rail
fences
*NL*
in
young
Western
towns
,
in
the
twilight
,
in
gossip
hardly
less
than
*NL*
fraternal
with
humorous
loafers
and
obscure
fortune-seekers
.
He
had
*NL*
notions
,
wherever
he
went
,
about
talking
with
the
natives
;
he
had
been
*NL*
assured
,
and
his
judgment
approved
the
advice
,
that
in
traveling
abroad
*NL*
it
was
an
excellent
thing
to
look
into
the
life
of
the
country
.
M.
*NL*
Nioche
was
very
much
of
a
native
and
,
though
his
life
might
not
be
*NL*
particularly
worth
looking
into
,
he
was
a
palpable
and
smoothly-rounded
*NL*
unit
in
that
picturesque
Parisian
civilization
which
offered
our
hero
so
*NL*
much
easy
entertainment
and
propounded
so
many
curious
problems
to
his
*NL*
inquiring
and
practical
mind
.
Newman
was
fond
of
statistics
;
he
liked
*NL*
to
know
how
things
were
done
;
it
gratified
him
to
learn
what
taxes
were
*NL*
paid
,
what
profits
were
gathered
,
what
commercial
habits
prevailed
,
how
*NL*
the
battle
of
life
was
fought
.
M.
Nioche
,
as
a
reduced
capitalist
,
was
*NL*
familiar
with
these
considerations
,
and
he
formulated
his
information
,
*NL*
which
he
was
proud
to
be
able
to
impart
,
in
the
neatest
possible
*NL*
terms
and
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
between
finger
and
thumb
.
As
a
*NL*
Frenchman
--
quite
apart
from
Newman
's
napoleons
--
M.
Nioche
loved
*NL*
conversation
,
and
even
in
his
decay
his
urbanity
had
not
grown
rusty
.
As
*NL*
a
Frenchman
,
too
,
he
could
give
a
clear
account
of
things
,
and
--
still
as
*NL*
a
Frenchman
--
when
his
knowledge
was
at
fault
he
could
supply
its
lapses
*NL*
with
the
most
convenient
and
ingenious
hypotheses
.
The
little
shrunken
*NL*
financier
was
intensely
delighted
to
have
questions
asked
him
,
and
he
*NL*
scraped
together
information
,
by
frugal
processes
,
and
took
notes
,
in
*NL*
his
little
greasy
pocket-book
,
of
incidents
which
might
interest
his
*NL*
munificent
friend
.
He
read
old
almanacs
at
the
book-stalls
on
the
quays
,
*NL*
and
he
began
to
frequent
another
cafe
,
where
more
newspapers
were
taken
*NL*
and
his
postprandial
demitasse
cost
him
a
penny
extra
,
and
where
he
used
*NL*
to
con
the
tattered
sheets
for
curious
anecdotes
,
freaks
of
nature
,
and
*NL*
strange
coincidences
.
He
would
relate
with
solemnity
the
next
morning
*NL*
that
a
child
of
five
years
of
age
had
lately
died
at
Bordeaux
,
whose
*NL*
brain
had
been
found
to
weigh
sixty
ounces
--
the
brain
of
a
Napoleon
or
*NL*
a
Washington
!
or
that
Madame
P
--
,
charcutiere
in
the
Rue
de
Clichy
,
had
*NL*
found
in
the
wadding
of
an
old
petticoat
the
sum
of
three
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty
francs
,
which
she
had
lost
five
years
before
.
He
pronounced
his
*NL*
words
with
great
distinctness
and
sonority
,
and
Newman
assured
him
*NL*
that
his
way
of
dealing
with
the
French
tongue
was
very
superior
to
the
*NL*
bewildering
chatter
that
he
heard
in
other
mouths
.
Upon
this
M.
Nioche
's
*NL*
accent
became
more
finely
trenchant
than
ever
,
he
offered
to
read
*NL*
extracts
from
Lamartine
,
and
he
protested
that
,
although
he
did
endeavor
*NL*
according
to
his
feeble
lights
to
cultivate
refinement
of
diction
,
*NL*
monsieur
,
if
he
wanted
the
real
thing
,
should
go
to
the
Theatre
*NL*
Francais
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
took
an
interest
in
French
thriftiness
and
conceived
a
lively
*NL*
admiration
for
Parisian
economies
.
His
own
economic
genius
was
so
*NL*
entirely
for
operations
on
a
larger
scale
,
and
,
to
move
at
his
ease
,
he
*NL*
needed
so
imperatively
the
sense
of
great
risks
and
great
prizes
,
that
*NL*
he
found
an
ungrudging
entertainment
in
the
spectacle
of
fortunes
made
*NL*
by
the
aggregation
of
copper
coins
,
and
in
the
minute
subdivision
of
*NL*
labor
and
profit
.
He
questioned
M.
Nioche
about
his
own
manner
of
life
,
*NL*
and
felt
a
friendly
mixture
of
compassion
and
respect
over
the
recital
*NL*
of
his
delicate
frugalities
.
The
worthy
man
told
him
how
,
at
one
period
,
*NL*
he
and
his
daughter
had
supported
existence
comfortably
upon
the
sum
of
*NL*
fifteen
sous
per
diem
;
recently
,
having
succeeded
in
hauling
ashore
the
*NL*
last
floating
fragments
of
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
,
his
budget
had
*NL*
been
a
trifle
more
ample
.
But
they
still
had
to
count
their
sous
very
*NL*
narrowly
,
and
M.
Nioche
intimated
with
a
sigh
that
Mademoiselle
Noemie
*NL*
did
not
bring
to
this
task
that
zealous
cooperation
which
might
have
*NL*
been
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
will
you
have
?
''
'
he
asked
,
philosophically
.
``
One
is
young
,
one
*NL*
is
pretty
,
one
needs
new
dresses
and
fresh
gloves
;
one
ca
n't
wear
shabby
*NL*
gowns
among
the
splendors
of
the
Louvre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
daughter
earns
enough
to
pay
for
her
own
clothes
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
looked
at
him
with
weak
,
uncertain
eyes
.
He
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
be
able
to
say
that
his
daughter
's
talents
were
appreciated
,
and
that
*NL*
her
crooked
little
daubs
commanded
a
market
;
but
it
seemed
a
scandal
*NL*
to
abuse
the
credulity
of
this
free-handed
stranger
,
who
,
without
a
*NL*
suspicion
or
a
question
,
had
admitted
him
to
equal
social
rights
.
He
*NL*
compromised
,
and
declared
that
while
it
was
obvious
that
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Noemie
's
reproductions
of
the
old
masters
had
only
to
be
seen
to
be
*NL*
coveted
,
the
prices
which
,
in
consideration
of
their
altogether
peculiar
*NL*
degree
of
finish
,
she
felt
obliged
to
ask
for
them
had
kept
purchasers
*NL*
at
a
respectful
distance
.
``
Poor
little
one
!
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
with
a
*NL*
sigh
;
``
it
is
almost
a
pity
that
her
work
is
so
perfect
!
It
would
be
in
*NL*
her
interest
to
paint
less
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
Mademoiselle
Noemie
has
this
devotion
to
her
art
,
''
Newman
once
*NL*
observed
,
``
why
should
you
have
those
fears
for
her
that
you
spoke
of
the
*NL*
other
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
meditated
:
there
was
an
inconsistency
in
his
position
;
it
made
*NL*
him
chronically
uncomfortable
.
Though
he
had
no
desire
to
destroy
the
*NL*
goose
with
the
golden
eggs
--
Newman
's
benevolent
confidence
--
he
felt
a
*NL*
tremulous
impulse
to
speak
out
all
his
trouble
.
``
Ah
,
she
is
an
artist
,
*NL*
my
dear
sir
,
most
assuredly
,
''
he
declared
.
``
But
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
*NL*
she
is
also
a
franche
coquette
.
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
''
he
added
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
world
of
harmless
bitterness
,
``
that
she
*NL*
comes
honestly
by
it
.
Her
mother
was
one
before
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
happy
with
your
wife
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
gave
half
a
dozen
little
backward
jerks
of
his
head
.
``
She
was
*NL*
my
purgatory
,
monsieur
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
deceived
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
my
nose
,
year
after
year
.
I
was
too
stupid
,
and
the
temptation
*NL*
was
too
great
.
But
I
found
her
out
at
last
.
I
have
only
been
once
in
my
*NL*
life
a
man
to
be
afraid
of
;
I
know
it
very
well
;
it
was
in
that
hour
!
*NL*
Nevertheless
I
do
n't
like
to
think
of
it
.
I
loved
her
--
I
ca
n't
tell
you
*NL*
how
much
.
She
was
a
bad
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
gone
to
her
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
influence
on
your
daughter
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
encouragingly
,
``
is
*NL*
not
to
be
feared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
cared
no
more
for
her
daughter
than
for
the
sole
of
her
shoe
!
But
*NL*
Noemie
has
no
need
of
influence
.
She
is
sufficient
to
herself
.
She
is
*NL*
stronger
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
obey
you
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
obey
,
monsieur
,
since
I
do
n't
command
.
What
would
be
the
use
?
*NL*
It
would
only
irritate
her
and
drive
her
to
some
coup
de
tete
.
She
is
*NL*
very
clever
,
like
her
mother
;
she
would
waste
no
time
about
it
.
As
a
*NL*
child
--
when
I
was
happy
,
or
supposed
I
was
--
she
studied
drawing
and
*NL*
painting
with
first-class
professors
,
and
they
assured
me
she
had
a
*NL*
talent
.
I
was
delighted
to
believe
it
,
and
when
I
went
into
society
I
*NL*
used
to
carry
her
pictures
with
me
in
a
portfolio
and
hand
them
round
*NL*
to
the
company
.
I
remember
,
once
,
a
lady
thought
I
was
offering
them
for
*NL*
sale
,
and
I
took
it
very
ill
.
We
do
n't
know
what
we
may
come
to
!
Then
*NL*
came
my
dark
days
,
and
my
explosion
with
Madame
Nioche
.
Noemie
had
no
*NL*
more
twenty-franc
lessons
;
but
in
the
course
of
time
,
when
she
grew
*NL*
older
,
and
it
became
highly
expedient
that
she
should
do
something
that
*NL*
would
help
to
keep
us
alive
,
she
bethought
herself
of
her
palette
*NL*
and
brushes
.
Some
of
our
friends
in
the
quartier
pronounced
the
idea
*NL*
fantastic
:
they
recommended
her
to
try
bonnet
making
,
to
get
a
situation
*NL*
in
a
shop
,
or
--
if
she
was
more
ambitious
--
to
advertise
for
a
place
of
*NL*
dame
de
compagnie
.
She
did
advertise
,
and
an
old
lady
wrote
her
a
letter
*NL*
and
bade
her
come
and
see
her
.
The
old
lady
liked
her
,
and
offered
her
*NL*
her
living
and
six
hundred
francs
a
year
;
but
Noemie
discovered
that
*NL*
she
passed
her
life
in
her
arm-chair
and
had
only
two
visitors
,
her
*NL*
confessor
and
her
nephew
:
the
confessor
very
strict
,
and
the
nephew
*NL*
a
man
of
fifty
,
with
a
broken
nose
and
a
government
clerkship
of
two
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
She
threw
her
old
lady
over
,
bought
a
paint-box
,
a
*NL*
canvas
,
and
a
new
dress
,
and
went
and
set
up
her
easel
in
the
Louvre
.
*NL*
There
in
one
place
and
another
,
she
has
passed
the
last
two
years
;
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
it
has
made
us
millionaires
.
But
Noemie
tells
me
that
Rome
was
*NL*
not
built
in
a
day
,
that
she
is
making
great
progress
,
that
I
must
leave
*NL*
her
to
her
own
devices
.
The
fact
is
,
without
prejudice
to
her
genius
,
*NL*
that
she
has
no
idea
of
burying
herself
alive
.
She
likes
to
see
the
*NL*
world
,
and
to
be
seen
.
She
says
,
herself
,
that
she
ca
n't
work
in
*NL*
the
dark
.
With
her
appearance
it
is
very
natural
.
Only
,
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
worrying
and
trembling
and
wondering
what
may
happen
to
her
there
all
*NL*
alone
,
day
after
day
,
amid
all
that
coming
and
going
of
strangers
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
be
always
at
her
side
.
I
go
with
her
in
the
morning
,
and
I
come
to
*NL*
fetch
her
away
,
but
she
wo
n't
have
me
near
her
in
the
interval
;
she
says
*NL*
I
make
her
nervous
.
As
if
it
did
n't
make
me
nervous
to
wander
about
*NL*
all
day
without
her
!
Ah
,
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
her
!
''
cried
*NL*
M.
Nioche
,
clenching
his
two
fists
and
jerking
back
his
head
again
,
*NL*
portentously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
guess
nothing
will
happen
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
should
shoot
her
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
'll
marry
her
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
since
that
's
how
you
manage
it
;
and
*NL*
I
will
go
and
see
her
tomorrow
at
the
Louvre
and
pick
out
the
pictures
*NL*
she
is
to
copy
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
had
brought
Newman
a
message
from
his
daughter
,
in
acceptance
*NL*
of
his
magnificent
commission
,
the
young
lady
declaring
herself
his
most
*NL*
devoted
servant
,
promising
her
most
zealous
endeavor
,
and
regretting
*NL*
that
the
proprieties
forbade
her
coming
to
thank
him
in
person
.
The
*NL*
morning
after
the
conversation
just
narrated
,
Newman
reverted
to
his
*NL*
intention
of
meeting
Mademoiselle
Noemie
at
the
Louvre
.
M.
Nioche
*NL*
appeared
preoccupied
,
and
left
his
budget
of
anecdotes
unopened
;
he
*NL*
took
a
great
deal
of
snuff
,
and
sent
certain
oblique
,
appealing
glances
*NL*
toward
his
stalwart
pupil
.
At
last
,
when
he
was
taking
his
leave
,
*NL*
he
stood
a
moment
,
after
he
had
polished
his
hat
with
his
calico
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
,
with
his
small
,
pale
eyes
fixed
strangely
upon
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
our
hero
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
the
solicitude
of
a
father
's
heart
!
''
said
M.
Nioche
.
``
You
*NL*
inspire
me
with
boundless
confidence
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
giving
you
a
*NL*
warning
.
After
all
,
you
are
a
man
,
you
are
young
and
at
liberty
.
Let
me
*NL*
beseech
you
,
then
,
to
respect
the
innocence
of
Mademoiselle
Nioche
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
wondered
what
was
coming
,
and
at
this
he
broke
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
that
his
own
innocence
struck
him
as
*NL*
the
more
exposed
,
but
he
contented
himself
with
promising
to
treat
the
*NL*
young
girl
with
nothing
less
than
veneration
.
He
found
her
waiting
for
*NL*
him
,
seated
upon
the
great
divan
in
the
Salon
Carre
.
She
was
not
in
*NL*
her
working-day
costume
,
but
wore
her
bonnet
and
gloves
and
carried
her
*NL*
parasol
,
in
honor
of
the
occasion
.
These
articles
had
been
selected
with
*NL*
unerring
taste
,
and
a
fresher
,
prettier
image
of
youthful
alertness
*NL*
and
blooming
discretion
was
not
to
be
conceived
.
She
made
Newman
a
most
*NL*
respectful
curtsey
and
expressed
her
gratitude
for
his
liberality
in
a
*NL*
wonderfully
graceful
little
speech
.
It
annoyed
him
to
have
a
charming
*NL*
young
girl
stand
there
thanking
him
,
and
it
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
*NL*
to
think
that
this
perfect
young
lady
,
with
her
excellent
manners
and
*NL*
her
finished
intonation
,
was
literally
in
his
pay
.
He
assured
her
,
in
*NL*
such
French
as
he
could
muster
,
that
the
thing
was
not
worth
mentioning
,
*NL*
and
that
he
considered
her
services
a
great
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
please
,
then
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
``
we
will
pass
the
*NL*
review
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
slowly
round
the
room
,
then
passed
into
the
others
and
*NL*
strolled
about
for
half
an
hour
.
Mademoiselle
Noemie
evidently
relished
*NL*
her
situation
,
and
had
no
desire
to
bring
her
public
interview
with
her
*NL*
striking-looking
patron
to
a
close
.
Newman
perceived
that
prosperity
*NL*
agreed
with
her
.
The
little
thin-lipped
,
peremptory
air
with
which
she
*NL*
had
addressed
her
father
on
the
occasion
of
their
former
meeting
had
*NL*
given
place
to
the
most
lingering
and
caressing
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
pictures
do
you
desire
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Sacred
,
or
profane
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
few
of
each
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
I
want
something
bright
and
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
gay
?
There
is
nothing
very
gay
in
this
solemn
old
Louvre
.
But
*NL*
we
will
see
what
we
can
find
.
You
speak
French
to-day
like
a
charm
.
My
*NL*
father
has
done
wonders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
a
bad
subject
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
am
too
old
to
learn
a
*NL*
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
old
?
Quelle
folie
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
with
a
clear
,
shrill
*NL*
laugh
.
``
You
are
a
very
young
man
.
And
how
do
you
like
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
very
nice
old
gentleman
.
He
never
laughs
at
my
blunders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
comme
il
faut
,
my
papa
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
``
and
as
*NL*
honest
as
the
day
.
Oh
,
an
exceptional
probity
!
You
could
trust
him
with
*NL*
millions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
always
obey
him
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Obey
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
do
what
he
bids
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
stopped
and
looked
at
him
;
she
had
a
spot
of
color
in
*NL*
either
cheek
,
and
in
her
expressive
French
eye
,
which
projected
too
much
*NL*
for
perfect
beauty
,
there
was
a
slight
gleam
of
audacity
.
``
Why
do
you
*NL*
ask
me
that
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
want
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
me
a
bad
girl
?
''
And
she
gave
a
strange
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
her
a
moment
;
he
saw
that
she
was
pretty
,
but
he
was
*NL*
not
in
the
least
dazzled
.
He
remembered
poor
M.
Nioche
's
solicitude
for
*NL*
her
``
innocence
,
''
and
he
laughed
as
his
eyes
met
hers
.
Her
face
was
the
*NL*
oddest
mixture
of
youth
and
maturity
,
and
beneath
her
candid
brow
*NL*
her
searching
little
smile
seemed
to
contain
a
world
of
ambiguous
*NL*
intentions
.
She
was
pretty
enough
,
certainly
to
make
her
father
nervous
;
*NL*
but
,
as
regards
her
innocence
,
Newman
felt
ready
on
the
spot
to
affirm
*NL*
that
she
had
never
parted
with
it
.
She
had
simply
never
had
any
;
she
had
*NL*
been
looking
at
the
world
since
she
was
ten
years
old
,
and
he
would
have
*NL*
been
a
wise
man
who
could
tell
her
any
secrets
.
In
her
long
mornings
at
*NL*
the
Louvre
she
had
not
only
studied
Madonnas
and
St.
Johns
;
she
had
kept
*NL*
an
eye
upon
all
the
variously
embodied
human
nature
around
her
,
and
she
*NL*
had
formed
her
conclusions
.
In
a
certain
sense
,
it
seemed
to
Newman
,
M.
*NL*
Nioche
might
be
at
rest
;
his
daughter
might
do
something
very
audacious
,
*NL*
but
she
would
never
do
anything
foolish
.
Newman
,
with
his
long-drawn
,
*NL*
leisurely
smile
,
and
his
even
,
unhurried
utterance
,
was
always
,
*NL*
mentally
,
taking
his
time
;
and
he
asked
himself
,
now
,
what
she
was
*NL*
looking
at
him
in
that
way
for
.
He
had
an
idea
that
she
would
like
him
*NL*
to
confess
that
he
did
think
her
a
bad
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
he
said
at
last
;
``
it
would
be
very
bad
manners
in
me
to
judge
*NL*
you
that
way
.
I
do
n't
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
father
has
complained
to
you
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
you
are
a
coquette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
n't
go
about
saying
such
things
to
gentlemen
!
But
you
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Newman
gravely
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
again
,
gave
a
shrug
and
a
smile
,
and
then
pointed
to
a
*NL*
small
Italian
picture
,
a
Marriage
of
St.
Catherine
.
``
How
should
you
like
*NL*
that
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
please
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
The
young
lady
in
the
yellow
dress
*NL*
is
not
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
a
great
connoisseur
,
''
murmured
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
pictures
?
Oh
,
no
;
I
know
very
little
about
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
pretty
women
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
I
am
hardly
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
to
that
,
then
?
''
the
young
girl
asked
,
indicating
a
*NL*
superb
Italian
portrait
of
a
lady
.
``
I
will
do
it
for
you
on
a
smaller
*NL*
scale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
a
smaller
scale
?
Why
not
as
large
as
the
original
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
glanced
at
the
glowing
splendor
of
the
Venetian
*NL*
masterpiece
and
gave
a
little
toss
of
her
head
.
``
I
do
n't
like
that
*NL*
woman
.
She
looks
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
like
her
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Decidedly
,
I
must
have
her
,
as
large
as
*NL*
life
.
And
just
as
stupid
as
she
is
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
again
,
and
with
her
mocking
smile
,
*NL*
``
It
certainly
ought
to
be
easy
for
me
to
make
her
look
stupid
!
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
asked
Newman
,
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
another
little
shrug
.
``
Seriously
,
then
,
you
want
that
*NL*
portrait
--
the
golden
hair
,
the
purple
satin
,
the
pearl
necklace
,
the
two
*NL*
magnificent
arms
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
--
just
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
nothing
else
do
,
instead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
want
some
other
things
,
but
I
want
that
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
turned
away
a
moment
,
walked
to
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
hall
,
and
stood
there
,
looking
vaguely
about
her
.
At
last
she
came
*NL*
back
.
``
It
must
be
charming
to
be
able
to
order
pictures
at
such
a
rate
.
*NL*
Venetian
portraits
,
as
large
as
life
!
You
go
at
it
en
prince
.
And
you
*NL*
are
going
to
travel
about
Europe
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
intend
to
travel
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ordering
,
buying
,
spending
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
shall
spend
some
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
happy
to
have
it
.
And
you
are
perfectly
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
,
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
nothing
to
bother
you
--
no
family
,
no
wife
,
no
fiancee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
tolerably
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
happy
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
le
veux
bien
!
''
said
Newman
,
proving
that
he
had
learned
more
French
*NL*
than
he
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
shall
you
stay
in
Paris
?
''
the
young
girl
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
few
days
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
getting
hot
,
and
I
must
go
to
Switzerland
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Switzerland
?
That
's
a
fine
country
.
I
would
give
my
new
parasol
*NL*
to
see
it
!
Lakes
and
mountains
,
romantic
valleys
and
icy
peaks
!
Oh
,
*NL*
I
congratulate
you
.
Meanwhile
,
I
shall
sit
here
through
all
the
hot
*NL*
summer
,
daubing
at
your
pictures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
take
your
time
about
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Do
them
at
your
*NL*
convenience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
farther
and
looked
at
a
dozen
other
things
.
Newman
pointed
*NL*
out
what
pleased
him
,
and
Mademoiselle
Noemie
generally
criticised
it
,
*NL*
and
proposed
something
else
.
Then
suddenly
she
diverged
and
began
to
*NL*
talk
about
some
personal
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
you
speak
to
me
the
other
day
in
the
Salon
Carre
?
''
she
*NL*
abruptly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admired
your
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
hesitated
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
nothing
rashly
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
you
watching
me
.
But
I
never
supposed
you
were
going
to
*NL*
speak
to
me
.
I
never
dreamed
I
should
be
walking
about
here
with
you
*NL*
to-day
.
It
's
very
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
natural
,
''
observed
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
beg
your
pardon
;
not
to
me
.
Coquette
as
you
think
me
,
I
have
*NL*
never
walked
about
in
public
with
a
gentleman
before
.
What
was
my
father
*NL*
thinking
of
,
when
he
consented
to
our
interview
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
repenting
of
his
unjust
accusations
,
''
replied
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
remained
silent
;
at
last
she
dropped
into
a
seat
.
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
for
those
five
it
is
fixed
,
''
she
said
.
``
Five
copies
as
*NL*
brilliant
and
beautiful
as
I
can
make
them
.
We
have
one
more
to
choose
.
*NL*
Should
n't
you
like
one
of
those
great
Rubenses
--
the
marriage
of
Marie
de
*NL*
Medicis
?
Just
look
at
it
and
see
how
handsome
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
should
like
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Finish
off
with
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
off
with
that
--
good
!
''
And
she
laughed
.
She
sat
a
moment
,
looking
*NL*
at
him
,
and
then
she
suddenly
rose
and
stood
before
him
,
with
her
hands
*NL*
hanging
and
clasped
in
front
of
her
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
''
she
said
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
how
a
man
can
be
so
ignorant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
ignorant
,
certainly
,
''
said
Newman
,
putting
his
hands
into
his
*NL*
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ridiculous
!
I
do
n't
know
how
to
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
how
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
paint
like
a
cat
;
I
ca
n't
draw
a
straight
line
.
I
never
sold
a
*NL*
picture
until
you
bought
that
thing
the
other
day
.
''
And
as
she
offered
*NL*
this
surprising
information
she
continued
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
burst
into
a
laugh
.
``
Why
do
you
tell
me
this
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
irritates
me
to
see
a
clever
man
blunder
so
.
My
pictures
are
*NL*
grotesque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
one
I
possess
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
is
rather
worse
than
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
like
it
all
the
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
askance
.
``
That
is
a
very
pretty
thing
to
say
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
;
``
but
it
is
my
duty
to
warn
you
before
you
go
farther
.
This
*NL*
order
of
yours
is
impossible
,
you
know
.
What
do
you
take
me
for
?
It
is
*NL*
work
for
ten
men
.
You
pick
out
the
six
most
difficult
pictures
in
the
*NL*
Louvre
,
and
you
expect
me
to
go
to
work
as
if
I
were
sitting
down
to
hem
*NL*
a
dozen
pocket
handkerchiefs
.
I
wanted
to
see
how
far
you
would
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
the
young
girl
in
some
perplexity
.
In
spite
of
the
*NL*
ridiculous
blunder
of
which
he
stood
convicted
,
he
was
very
far
from
*NL*
being
a
simpleton
,
and
he
had
a
lively
suspicion
that
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Noemie
's
sudden
frankness
was
not
essentially
more
honest
than
her
*NL*
leaving
him
in
error
would
have
been
.
She
was
playing
a
game
;
she
*NL*
was
not
simply
taking
pity
on
his
aesthetic
verdancy
.
What
was
it
she
*NL*
expected
to
win
?
The
stakes
were
high
and
the
risk
was
great
;
the
prize
*NL*
therefore
must
have
been
commensurate
.
But
even
granting
that
the
prize
*NL*
might
be
great
,
Newman
could
not
resist
a
movement
of
admiration
for
his
*NL*
companion
's
intrepidity
.
She
was
throwing
away
with
one
hand
,
whatever
*NL*
she
might
intend
to
do
with
the
other
,
a
very
handsome
sum
of
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
joking
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
are
you
serious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
serious
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
Noemie
,
but
with
her
extraordinary
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
very
little
about
pictures
or
how
they
are
painted
.
If
you
ca
n't
*NL*
do
all
that
,
of
course
you
ca
n't
.
Do
what
you
can
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
very
bad
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
,
``
if
you
are
determined
it
shall
be
bad
,
of
*NL*
course
it
will
.
But
why
do
you
go
on
painting
badly
?

The
young
girl
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
He
knows
very
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
Newman
declared
;
``
I
am
sure
he
believes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
afraid
of
me

I
go
on

badly

as
you

because
I
want
*NL*
to

I
like
it

at
any

And
I
like
being
here
;
it
is
a
place
*NL*
to
come
to
,
every
day

it
is
better
than
sitting
in

dark

damp

on

selling
buttons

whalebones
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
much
more
amusing
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
for
a
poor
girl
*NL*
is
n't
it
rather
an
expensive
amusement

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
very
wrong

there
is
no

said
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Noemie

``
But
rather

toiling

a

holes

out

I
would
throw
myself
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no

Newman
answered
;

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
for
some
time
,
meditating
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
At
last
,
looking
up
,
``
What

can
you

she
asked

*NL*

cried
the

done

no

I
could

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
did
you
expect
it
to
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't

*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
her
a
moment
.
``
Well
,
your
pictures
may
be
bad
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
but
you
are
too
clever
for
me
,
nevertheless
.
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
you

Good-by

And
he
put
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
response
,
and
offered
him
no
farewell
.
She
turned
away
and
*NL*
seated
herself
sidewise
on
a
bench
,
leaning
her
head
on
the
back
of
her
*NL*
hand
,
which
clasped
the
rail
in
front
of
the
pictures
.
Newman
stood
a
*NL*
moment
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
retreated
.
He
had
understood
her
*NL*
better
than
he
confessed
;
this
singular
scene
was
a
practical
commentary
*NL*
upon
her
father
's
statement
that
she
was
a
frank
coquette
.

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Newman
related
to
Mrs.
Tristram
his
fruitless
visit
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
,
she
urged
him
not
to
be
discouraged
,
but
to
carry
out
his
plan
*NL*
of
``
seeing
Europe
''
during
the
summer
,
and
return
to
Paris
in
the
autumn
*NL*
and
settle
down
comfortably
for
the
winter
.
``
Madame
de
Cintre
will
*NL*
keep
,
''
she
said
;
``
she
is
not
a
woman
who
will
marry
from
one
day
to
*NL*
another
.
''
Newman
made
no
distinct
affirmation
that
he
would
come
back
*NL*
to
Paris
;
he
even
talked
about
Rome
and
the
Nile
,
and
abstained
from
*NL*
professing
any
especial
interest
in
Madame
de
Cintre
's
continued
*NL*
widowhood
.
This
circumstance
was
at
variance
with
his
habitual
*NL*
frankness
,
and
may
perhaps
be
regarded
as
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
incipient
stage
of
that
passion
which
is
more
particularly
known
as
the
*NL*
mysterious
one
.
The
truth
is
that
the
expression
of
a
pair
of
eyes
that
*NL*
were
at
once
brilliant
and
mild
had
become
very
familiar
to
his
memory
,
*NL*
and
he
would
not
easily
have
resigned
himself
to
the
prospect
of
never
*NL*
looking
into
them
again
.
He
communicated
to
Mrs.
Tristram
a
number
of
*NL*
other
facts
,
of
greater
or
less
importance
,
as
you
choose
;
but
on
this
*NL*
particular
point
he
kept
his
own
counsel
.
He
took
a
kindly
leave
of
*NL*
M.
Nioche
,
having
assured
him
that
,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
,
the
*NL*
blue-cloaked
Madonna
herself
might
have
been
present
at
his
*NL*
interview
with
Mademoiselle
Noemie
;
and
left
the
old
man
nursing
his
*NL*
breast-pocket
,
in
an
ecstasy
which
the
acutest
misfortune
might
have
*NL*
been
defied
to
dissipate
.
Newman
then
started
on
his
travels
,
with
all
*NL*
his
usual
appearance
of
slow-strolling
leisure
,
and
all
his
essential
*NL*
directness
and
intensity
of
aim
.
No
man
seemed
less
in
a
hurry
,
and
*NL*
yet
no
man
achieved
more
in
brief
periods
.
He
had
certain
practical
*NL*
instincts
which
served
him
excellently
in
his
trade
of
tourist
.
He
found
*NL*
his
way
in
foreign
cities
by
divination
,
his
memory
was
excellent
when
*NL*
once
his
attention
had
been
at
all
cordially
given
,
and
he
emerged
from
*NL*
dialogues
in
foreign
tongues
,
of
which
he
had
,
formally
,
not
understood
*NL*
a
word
,
in
full
possession
of
the
particular
fact
he
had
desired
to
*NL*
ascertain
.
His
appetite
for
facts
was
capacious
,
and
although
many
of
*NL*
those
which
he
noted
would
have
seemed
woefully
dry
and
colorless
to
the
*NL*
ordinary
sentimental
traveler
,
a
careful
inspection
of
the
list
would
*NL*
have
shown
that
he
had
a
soft
spot
in
his
imagination
.
In
the
charming
*NL*
city
of
Brussels
--
his
first
stopping-place
after
leaving
Paris
--
he
*NL*
asked
a
great
many
questions
about
the
street-cars
,
and
took
extreme
*NL*
satisfaction
in
the
reappearance
of
this
familiar
symbol
of
American
*NL*
civilization
;
but
he
was
also
greatly
struck
with
the
beautiful
Gothic
*NL*
tower
of
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
and
wondered
whether
it
would
not
be
*NL*
possible
to
``
get
up
''
something
like
it
in
San
Francisco
.
He
stood
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
in
the
crowded
square
before
this
edifice
,
in
imminent
*NL*
danger
from
carriage-wheels
,
listening
to
a
toothless
old
cicerone
*NL*
mumble
in
broken
English
the
touching
history
of
Counts
Egmont
and
Horn
;
*NL*
and
he
wrote
the
names
of
these
gentlemen
--
for
reasons
best
known
to
*NL*
himself
--
on
the
back
of
an
old
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
outset
,
on
his
leaving
Paris
,
his
curiosity
had
not
been
intense
;
*NL*
passive
entertainment
,
in
the
Champs
Elysees
and
at
the
theatres
,
seemed
*NL*
about
as
much
as
he
need
expect
of
himself
,
and
although
,
as
he
had
said
*NL*
to
Tristram
,
he
wanted
to
see
the
mysterious
,
satisfying
BEST
,
he
had
*NL*
not
the
Grand
Tour
in
the
least
on
his
conscience
,
and
was
not
given
to
*NL*
cross-questioning
the
amusement
of
the
hour
.
He
believed
that
Europe
*NL*
was
made
for
him
,
and
not
he
for
Europe
.
He
had
said
that
he
wanted
*NL*
to
improve
his
mind
,
but
he
would
have
felt
a
certain
embarrassment
,
a
*NL*
certain
shame
,
even
--
a
false
shame
,
possibly
--
if
he
had
caught
himself
*NL*
looking
intellectually
into
the
mirror
.
Neither
in
this
nor
in
any
other
*NL*
respect
had
Newman
a
high
sense
of
responsibility
;
it
was
his
prime
*NL*
conviction
that
a
man
's
life
should
be
easy
,
and
that
he
should
be
able
*NL*
to
resolve
privilege
into
a
matter
of
course
.
The
world
,
to
his
sense
,
*NL*
was
a
great
bazaar
,
where
one
might
stroll
about
and
purchase
handsome
*NL*
things
;
but
he
was
no
more
conscious
,
individually
,
of
social
pressure
*NL*
than
he
admitted
the
existence
of
such
a
thing
as
an
obligatory
*NL*
purchase
.
He
had
not
only
a
dislike
,
but
a
sort
of
moral
mistrust
,
*NL*
of
uncomfortable
thoughts
,
and
it
was
both
uncomfortable
and
slightly
*NL*
contemptible
to
feel
obliged
to
square
one
's
self
with
a
standard
.
*NL*
One
's
standard
was
the
ideal
of
one
's
own
good-humored
prosperity
,
the
*NL*
prosperity
which
enabled
one
to
give
as
well
as
take
.
To
expand
,
*NL*
without
bothering
about
it
--
without
shiftless
timidity
on
one
side
,
or
*NL*
loquacious
eagerness
on
the
other
--
to
the
full
compass
of
what
he
*NL*
would
have
called
a
``
pleasant
''
experience
,
was
Newman
's
most
definite
*NL*
programme
of
life
.
He
had
always
hated
to
hurry
to
catch
railroad
*NL*
trains
,
and
yet
he
had
always
caught
them
;
and
just
so
an
undue
*NL*
solicitude
for
``
culture
''
seemed
a
sort
of
silly
dawdling
at
the
*NL*
station
,
a
proceeding
properly
confined
to
women
,
foreigners
,
and
other
*NL*
unpractical
persons
.
All
this
admitted
,
Newman
enjoyed
his
journey
,
*NL*
when
once
he
had
fairly
entered
the
current
,
as
profoundly
as
the
most
*NL*
zealous
dilettante
.
One
's
theories
,
after
all
,
matter
little
;
it
is
*NL*
one
's
humor
that
is
the
great
thing
.
Our
friend
was
intelligent
,
and
*NL*
he
could
not
help
that
.
He
lounged
through
Belgium
and
Holland
and
*NL*
the
Rhineland
,
through
Switzerland
and
Northern
Italy
,
planning
about
*NL*
nothing
,
but
seeing
everything
.
The
guides
and
valets
de
place
found
*NL*
him
an
excellent
subject
.
He
was
always
approachable
,
for
he
was
much
*NL*
addicted
to
standing
about
in
the
vestibules
and
porticos
of
inns
,
and
*NL*
he
availed
himself
little
of
the
opportunities
for
impressive
seclusion
*NL*
which
are
so
liberally
offered
in
Europe
to
gentlemen
who
travel
*NL*
with
long
purses
.
When
an
excursion
,
a
church
,
a
gallery
,
a
ruin
,
was
*NL*
proposed
to
him
,
the
first
thing
Newman
usually
did
,
after
surveying
*NL*
his
postulant
in
silence
,
from
head
to
foot
,
was
to
sit
down
at
a
little
*NL*
table
and
order
something
to
drink
.
The
cicerone
,
during
this
process
,
*NL*
usually
retreated
to
a
respectful
distance
;
otherwise
I
am
not
sure
that
*NL*
Newman
would
not
have
bidden
him
sit
down
and
have
a
glass
also
,
and
*NL*
tell
him
as
an
honest
fellow
whether
his
church
or
his
gallery
was
*NL*
really
worth
a
man
's
trouble
.
At
last
he
rose
and
stretched
his
long
*NL*
legs
,
beckoned
to
the
man
of
monuments
,
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
*NL*
fixed
his
eye
on
his
adversary
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
.
``
How
far
?
''
And
*NL*
whatever
the
answer
was
,
although
he
sometimes
seemed
to
hesitate
,
he
*NL*
never
declined
.
He
stepped
into
an
open
cab
,
made
his
conductor
sit
*NL*
beside
him
to
answer
questions
,
bade
the
driver
go
fast
-LRB-
he
had
a
*NL*
particular
aversion
to
slow
driving
-RRB-
and
rolled
,
in
all
probability
*NL*
through
a
dusty
suburb
,
to
the
goal
of
his
pilgrimage
.
If
the
goal
was
a
*NL*
disappointment
,
if
the
church
was
meagre
,
or
the
ruin
a
heap
of
rubbish
,
*NL*
Newman
never
protested
or
berated
his
cicerone
;
he
looked
with
an
*NL*
impartial
eye
upon
great
monuments
and
small
,
made
the
guide
recite
his
*NL*
lesson
,
listened
to
it
religiously
,
asked
if
there
was
nothing
else
to
*NL*
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
drove
back
again
at
a
rattling
pace
.
*NL*
It
is
to
be
feared
that
his
perception
of
the
difference
between
good
*NL*
architecture
and
bad
was
not
acute
,
and
that
he
might
sometimes
have
*NL*
been
seen
gazing
with
culpable
serenity
at
inferior
productions
.
Ugly
*NL*
churches
were
a
part
of
his
pastime
in
Europe
,
as
well
as
beautiful
*NL*
ones
,
and
his
tour
was
altogether
a
pastime
.
But
there
is
sometimes
*NL*
nothing
like
the
imagination
of
these
people
who
have
none
,
and
Newman
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
in
an
unguided
stroll
in
a
foreign
city
,
before
some
*NL*
lonely
,
sad-towered
church
,
or
some
angular
image
of
one
who
had
*NL*
rendered
civic
service
in
an
unknown
past
,
had
felt
a
singular
inward
*NL*
tremor
.
It
was
not
an
excitement
or
a
perplexity
;
it
was
a
placid
,
*NL*
fathomless
sense
of
diversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
encountered
by
chance
in
Holland
a
young
American
,
with
whom
,
for
*NL*
a
time
,
he
formed
a
sort
of
traveler
's
partnership
.
They
were
men
of
a
*NL*
very
different
cast
,
but
each
,
in
his
way
,
was
so
good
a
fellow
that
,
*NL*
for
a
few
weeks
at
least
,
it
seemed
something
of
a
pleasure
to
share
*NL*
the
chances
of
the
road
.
Newman
's
comrade
,
whose
name
was
Babcock
,
was
*NL*
a
young
Unitarian
minister
,
a
small
,
spare
,
neatly-attired
man
,
with
*NL*
a
strikingly
candid
physiognomy
.
He
was
a
native
of
Dorchester
,
*NL*
Massachusetts
,
and
had
spiritual
charge
of
a
small
congregation
in
*NL*
another
suburb
of
the
New
England
metropolis
.
His
digestion
was
weak
and
*NL*
he
lived
chiefly
on
Graham
bread
and
hominy
--
a
regimen
to
which
he
was
*NL*
so
much
attached
that
his
tour
seemed
to
him
destined
to
be
blighted
*NL*
when
,
on
landing
on
the
Continent
,
he
found
that
these
delicacies
did
*NL*
not
flourish
under
the
table
d'hote
system
.
In
Paris
he
had
purchased
*NL*
a
bag
of
hominy
at
an
establishment
which
called
itself
an
American
*NL*
Agency
,
and
at
which
the
New
York
illustrated
papers
were
also
to
*NL*
be
procured
,
and
he
had
carried
it
about
with
him
,
and
shown
extreme
*NL*
serenity
and
fortitude
in
the
somewhat
delicate
position
of
having
his
*NL*
hominy
prepared
for
him
and
served
at
anomalous
hours
,
at
the
hotels
he
*NL*
successively
visited
.
Newman
had
once
spent
a
morning
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
business
,
at
Mr.
Babcock
's
birthplace
,
and
,
for
reasons
too
recondite
*NL*
to
unfold
,
his
visit
there
always
assumed
in
his
mind
a
jocular
cast
.
*NL*
To
carry
out
his
joke
,
which
certainly
seems
poor
so
long
as
it
is
*NL*
not
explained
,
he
used
often
to
address
his
companion
as
``
Dorchester
.
''
*NL*
Fellow-travelers
very
soon
grow
intimate
but
it
is
highly
improbable
*NL*
that
at
home
these
extremely
dissimilar
characters
would
have
found
any
*NL*
very
convenient
points
of
contact
.
They
were
,
indeed
,
as
different
as
*NL*
possible
.
Newman
,
who
never
reflected
on
such
matters
,
accepted
the
*NL*
situation
with
great
equanimity
,
but
Babcock
used
to
meditate
over
*NL*
it
privately
;
used
often
,
indeed
,
to
retire
to
his
room
early
in
the
*NL*
evening
for
the
express
purpose
of
considering
it
conscientiously
*NL*
and
impartially
.
He
was
not
sure
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
him
to
*NL*
associate
with
our
hero
,
whose
way
of
taking
life
was
so
little
his
own
.
*NL*
Newman
was
an
excellent
,
generous
fellow
;
Mr.
Babcock
sometimes
said
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
a
NOBLE
fellow
,
and
,
certainly
,
it
was
impossible
*NL*
not
to
like
him
.
But
would
it
not
be
desirable
to
try
to
exert
an
*NL*
influence
upon
him
,
to
try
to
quicken
his
moral
life
and
sharpen
his
*NL*
sense
of
duty
?
He
liked
everything
,
he
accepted
everything
,
he
found
*NL*
amusement
in
everything
;
he
was
not
discriminating
,
he
had
not
a
high
*NL*
tone
.
The
young
man
from
Dorchester
accused
Newman
of
a
fault
which
he
*NL*
considered
very
grave
,
and
which
he
did
his
best
to
avoid
:
what
he
would
*NL*
have
called
a
want
of
``
moral
reaction
.
''
Poor
Mr.
Babcock
was
extremely
*NL*
fond
of
pictures
and
churches
,
and
carried
Mrs.
Jameson
's
works
about
*NL*
in
his
trunk
;
he
delighted
in
aesthetic
analysis
,
and
received
peculiar
*NL*
impressions
from
everything
he
saw
.
But
nevertheless
in
his
secret
soul
*NL*
he
detested
Europe
,
and
he
felt
an
irritating
need
to
protest
against
*NL*
Newman
's
gross
intellectual
hospitality
.
Mr.
Babcock
's
moral
malaise
,
I
*NL*
am
afraid
,
lay
deeper
than
where
any
definition
of
mine
can
reach
it
.
*NL*
He
mistrusted
the
European
temperament
,
he
suffered
from
the
European
*NL*
climate
,
he
hated
the
European
dinner-hour
;
European
life
seemed
to
him
*NL*
unscrupulous
and
impure
.
And
yet
he
had
an
exquisite
sense
of
beauty
;
*NL*
and
as
beauty
was
often
inextricably
associated
with
the
above
*NL*
displeasing
conditions
,
as
he
wished
,
above
all
,
to
be
just
and
*NL*
dispassionate
,
and
as
he
was
,
furthermore
,
extremely
devoted
to
*NL*
``
culture
,
''
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
decide
that
Europe
was
utterly
*NL*
bad
.
But
he
thought
it
was
very
bad
indeed
,
and
his
quarrel
with
Newman
*NL*
was
that
this
unregulated
epicure
had
a
sadly
insufficient
perception
*NL*
of
the
bad
.
Babcock
himself
really
knew
as
little
about
the
bad
,
in
any
*NL*
quarter
of
the
world
,
as
a
nursing
infant
,
his
most
vivid
realization
of
*NL*
evil
had
been
the
discovery
that
one
of
his
college
classmates
,
who
was
*NL*
studying
architecture
in
Paris
had
a
love
affair
with
a
young
woman
who
*NL*
did
not
expect
him
to
marry
her
.
Babcock
had
related
this
incident
to
*NL*
Newman
,
and
our
hero
had
applied
an
epithet
of
an
unflattering
sort
to
*NL*
the
young
girl
.
The
next
day
his
companion
asked
him
whether
he
was
*NL*
very
sure
he
had
used
exactly
the
right
word
to
characterize
the
young
*NL*
architect
's
mistress
.
Newman
stared
and
laughed
.
``
There
are
a
great
many
*NL*
words
to
express
that
idea
,
''
he
said
;
``
you
can
take
your
choice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
mean
,
''
said
Babcock
,
``
was
she
possibly
not
to
be
considered
in
a
*NL*
different
light
?
Do
n't
you
think
she
really
expected
him
to
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Very
likely
she
did
;
I
have
no
*NL*
doubt
she
is
a
grand
woman
.
''
And
he
began
to
laugh
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
that
either
,
''
said
Babcock
,
``
I
was
only
afraid
that
I
*NL*
might
have
seemed
yesterday
not
to
remember
--
not
to
consider
;
well
,
I
*NL*
think
I
will
write
to
Percival
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
written
to
Percival
-LRB-
who
answered
him
in
a
really
impudent
*NL*
fashion
-RRB-
,
and
he
had
reflected
that
it
was
somehow
,
raw
and
reckless
in
*NL*
Newman
to
assume
in
that
off-hand
manner
that
the
young
woman
in
Paris
*NL*
might
be
``
grand
.
''
The
brevity
of
Newman
's
judgments
very
often
shocked
*NL*
and
discomposed
him
.
He
had
a
way
of
damning
people
without
farther
*NL*
appeal
,
or
of
pronouncing
them
capital
company
in
the
face
of
*NL*
uncomfortable
symptoms
,
which
seemed
unworthy
of
a
man
whose
conscience
*NL*
had
been
properly
cultivated
.
And
yet
poor
Babcock
liked
him
,
and
*NL*
remembered
that
even
if
he
was
sometimes
perplexing
and
painful
,
this
*NL*
was
not
a
reason
for
giving
him
up
.
Goethe
recommended
seeing
human
*NL*
nature
in
the
most
various
forms
,
and
Mr.
Babcock
thought
Goethe
*NL*
perfectly
splendid
.
He
often
tried
,
in
odd
half-hours
of
conversation
*NL*
to
infuse
into
Newman
a
little
of
his
own
spiritual
starch
,
but
Newman
's
*NL*
personal
texture
was
too
loose
to
admit
of
stiffening
.
His
mind
could
no
*NL*
more
hold
principles
than
a
sieve
can
hold
water
.
He
admired
principles
*NL*
extremely
,
and
thought
Babcock
a
mighty
fine
little
fellow
for
having
*NL*
so
many
.
He
accepted
all
that
his
high-strung
companion
offered
him
,
*NL*
and
put
them
away
in
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
very
safe
place
;
but
poor
*NL*
Babcock
never
afterwards
recognized
his
gifts
among
the
articles
that
*NL*
Newman
had
in
daily
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
traveled
together
through
Germany
and
into
Switzerland
,
where
*NL*
for
three
or
four
weeks
they
trudged
over
passes
and
lounged
upon
blue
*NL*
lakes
.
At
last
they
crossed
the
Simplon
and
made
their
way
to
Venice
.
*NL*
Mr.
Babcock
had
become
gloomy
and
even
a
trifle
irritable
;
he
seemed
*NL*
moody
,
absent
,
preoccupied
;
he
got
his
plans
into
a
tangle
,
and
talked
*NL*
one
moment
of
doing
one
thing
and
the
next
of
doing
another
.
Newman
led
*NL*
his
usual
life
,
made
acquaintances
,
took
his
ease
in
the
galleries
and
*NL*
churches
,
spent
an
unconscionable
amount
of
time
in
strolling
in
the
*NL*
Piazza
San
Marco
,
bought
a
great
many
bad
pictures
,
and
for
a
fortnight
*NL*
enjoyed
Venice
grossly
.
One
evening
,
coming
back
to
his
inn
,
he
found
*NL*
Babcock
waiting
for
him
in
the
little
garden
beside
it
.
The
young
man
*NL*
walked
up
to
him
,
looking
very
dismal
,
thrust
out
his
hand
,
and
said
*NL*
with
solemnity
that
he
was
afraid
they
must
part
.
Newman
expressed
*NL*
his
surprise
and
regret
,
and
asked
why
a
parting
had
became
necessary
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
I
'm
tired
of
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
tired
of
me
?
''
demanded
Babcock
,
fixing
him
with
his
clear
*NL*
gray
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
deuce
should
I
be
?
You
are
a
very
plucky
fellow
.
Besides
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
grow
tired
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
understand
each
other
,
''
said
the
young
minister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
understand
you
?
''
cried
Newman
.
``
Why
,
I
hoped
I
did
.
But
what
if
*NL*
I
do
n't
;
where
's
the
harm
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
YOU
,
''
said
Babcock
.
And
he
sat
down
and
rested
his
*NL*
head
on
his
hand
,
and
looked
up
mournfully
at
his
immeasurable
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Lord
,
I
do
n't
mind
that
!
''
cried
Newman
,
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
very
distressing
to
me
.
It
keeps
me
in
a
state
of
unrest
.
It
*NL*
irritates
me
;
I
ca
n't
settle
anything
.
I
do
n't
think
it
's
good
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
worry
too
much
;
that
's
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
must
seem
so
to
you
.
You
think
I
take
things
too
hard
,
and
*NL*
I
think
you
take
things
too
easily
.
We
can
never
agree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
agreed
very
well
all
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
agreed
,
''
said
Babcock
,
shaking
his
head
.
``
I
am
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
I
ought
to
have
separated
from
you
a
month
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
horrors
!
I
'll
agree
to
anything
!
''
cried
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Babcock
buried
his
head
in
both
hands
.
At
last
looking
up
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
you
appreciate
my
position
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
try
to
arrive
at
the
*NL*
truth
about
everything
.
And
then
you
go
too
fast
.
For
me
,
you
are
too
*NL*
passionate
,
too
extravagant
.
I
feel
as
if
I
ought
to
go
over
all
this
*NL*
ground
we
have
traversed
again
,
by
myself
,
alone
.
I
am
afraid
I
have
*NL*
made
a
great
many
mistakes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
give
so
many
reasons
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
are
simply
*NL*
tired
of
my
company
.
You
have
a
good
right
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
am
not
tired
!
''
cried
the
pestered
young
divine
.
``
It
is
very
*NL*
wrong
to
be
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
it
up
!
''
laughed
Newman
.
``
But
of
course
it
will
never
do
to
go
*NL*
on
making
mistakes

Go
your
way
,
by
all
means
.
I
shall
miss
you
;
but
you
*NL*
have
seen
I
make
friends
very
easily
.
You
will
be
lonely
,
yourself
;
*NL*
but
drop
me
a
line
,
when
you
feel
like
it
,
and
I
will
wait
for
you
*NL*
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
will
go
back
to
Milan
.
I
am
afraid
I
did
n't
do
justice
to
*NL*
Luini
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Luini
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
I
am
afraid
I
overestimated
him
.
I
do
n't
think
that
he
is
a
*NL*
painter
of
the
first
rank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luini
?
''
Newman
exclaimed
;
``
why
,
he
's
enchanting
--
he
's
magnificent
!
*NL*
There
is
something
in
his
genius
that
is
like
a
beautiful
woman
.
It
*NL*
gives
one
the
same
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Babcock
frowned
and
winced
.
And
it
must
be
added
that
this
was
,
for
*NL*
Newman
,
an
unusually
metaphysical
flight
;
but
in
passing
through
Milan
*NL*
he
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
painter
.
``
There
you
are
again
!
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
Babcock
.
``
Yes
,
we
had
better
separate
.
''
And
on
the
morrow
he
*NL*
retraced
his
steps
and
proceeded
to
tone
down
his
impressions
of
the
*NL*
great
Lombard
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
afterwards
Newman
received
a
note
from
his
late
companion
*NL*
which
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
Dear
Mr.
Newman
,
--
I
am
afraid
that
my
conduct
at
Venice
,
a
week
ago
,
*NL*
seemed
to
you
strange
and
ungrateful
,
and
I
wish
to
explain
my
position
,
*NL*
which
,
as
I
said
at
the
time
,
I
do
not
think
you
appreciate
.
I
had
long
*NL*
had
it
on
my
mind
to
propose
that
we
should
part
company
,
and
this
step
*NL*
was
not
really
so
abrupt
as
it
seemed
.
In
the
first
place
,
you
know
,
I
*NL*
am
traveling
in
Europe
on
funds
supplied
by
my
congregation
,
who
kindly
*NL*
offered
me
a
vacation
and
an
opportunity
to
enrich
my
mind
with
the
*NL*
treasures
of
nature
and
art
in
the
Old
World
.
I
feel
,
therefore
,
as
if
I
*NL*
ought
to
use
my
time
to
the
very
best
advantage
.
I
have
a
high
sense
of
*NL*
responsibility
.
You
appear
to
care
only
for
the
pleasure
of
the
hour
,
*NL*
and
you
give
yourself
up
to
it
with
a
violence
which
I
confess
I
am
not
*NL*
able
to
emulate
.
I
feel
as
if
I
must
arrive
at
some
conclusion
and
fix
*NL*
my
belief
on
certain
points
.
Art
and
life
seem
to
me
intensely
serious
*NL*
things
,
and
in
our
travels
in
Europe
we
should
especially
remember
the
*NL*
immense
seriousness
of
Art
.
You
seem
to
hold
that
if
a
thing
amuses
you
*NL*
for
the
moment
,
that
is
all
you
need
ask
for
it
,
and
your
relish
for
*NL*
mere
amusement
is
also
much
higher
than
mine
.
You
put
,
however
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
reckless
confidence
into
your
pleasure
which
at
times
,
I
confess
,
has
*NL*
seemed
to
me
--
shall
I
say
it
?
--
almost
cynical
.
Your
way
at
any
rate
is
*NL*
not
my
way
,
and
it
is
unwise
that
we
should
attempt
any
longer
to
pull
*NL*
together
.
And
yet
,
let
me
add
that
I
know
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
*NL*
said
for
your
way
;
I
have
felt
its
attraction
,
in
your
society
,
very
*NL*
strongly
.
But
for
this
I
should
have
left
you
long
ago
.
But
I
was
so
*NL*
perplexed
.
I
hope
I
have
not
done
wrong
.
I
feel
as
if
I
had
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
lost
time
to
make
up
.
I
beg
you
take
all
this
as
I
mean
it
,
which
,
*NL*
Heaven
knows
,
is
not
invidiously
.
I
have
a
great
personal
esteem
for
you
*NL*
and
hope
that
some
day
,
when
I
have
recovered
my
balance
,
we
shall
meet
*NL*
again
.
I
hope
you
will
continue
to
enjoy
your
travels
,
only
DO
remember
*NL*
that
Life
and
Art
ARE
extremely
serious
.
Believe
me
your
sincere
friend
*NL*
and
well-wisher

BENJAMIN
BABCOCK
*NL*
*NL*
P.
S.
I
am
greatly
perplexed
by
Luini
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
produced
in
Newman
's
mind
a
singular
mixture
of
exhilaration
*NL*
and
awe
.
At
first
,
Mr.
Babcock
's
tender
conscience
seemed
to
him
a
*NL*
capital
farce
,
and
his
traveling
back
to
Milan
only
to
get
into
a
*NL*
deeper
muddle
appeared
,
as
the
reward
of
his
pedantry
,
exquisitely
and
*NL*
ludicrously
just
.
Then
Newman
reflected
that
these
are
mighty
mysteries
,
*NL*
that
possibly
he
himself
was
indeed
that
baleful
and
barely
mentionable
*NL*
thing
,
a
cynic
,
and
that
his
manner
of
considering
the
treasures
of
art
*NL*
and
the
privileges
of
life
was
probably
very
base
and
immoral
.
Newman
*NL*
had
a
great
contempt
for
immorality
,
and
that
evening
,
for
a
good
half
*NL*
hour
,
as
he
sat
watching
the
star-sheen
on
the
warm
Adriatic
,
he
felt
*NL*
rebuked
and
depressed
.
He
was
at
a
loss
how
to
answer
Babcock
's
letter
.
*NL*
His
good
nature
checked
his
resenting
the
young
minister
's
lofty
*NL*
admonitions
,
and
his
tough
,
inelastic
sense
of
humor
forbade
his
taking
*NL*
them
seriously
.
He
wrote
no
answer
at
all
but
a
day
or
two
afterward
he
*NL*
found
in
a
curiosity
shop
a
grotesque
little
statuette
in
ivory
,
of
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
,
which
he
sent
off
to
Babcock
without
a
commentary
.
It
*NL*
represented
a
gaunt
,
ascetic-looking
monk
,
in
a
tattered
gown
and
cowl
,
*NL*
kneeling
with
clasped
hands
and
pulling
a
portentously
long
face
.
It
was
*NL*
a
wonderfully
delicate
piece
of
carving
,
and
in
a
moment
,
through
one
*NL*
of
the
rents
of
his
gown
,
you
espied
a
fat
capon
hung
round
the
monk
's
*NL*
waist
.
In
Newman
's
intention
what
did
the
figure
symbolize
?
Did
it
mean
*NL*
that
he
was
going
to
try
to
be
as
``
high-toned
''
as
the
monk
looked
at
*NL*
first
,
but
that
he
feared
he
should
succeed
no
better
than
the
friar
,
on
*NL*
a
closer
inspection
,
proved
to
have
done
?
It
is
not
supposable
that
he
*NL*
intended
a
satire
upon
Babcock
's
own
asceticism
,
for
this
would
have
*NL*
been
a
truly
cynical
stroke
.
He
made
his
late
companion
,
at
any
rate
,
a
*NL*
very
valuable
little
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
on
leaving
Venice
,
went
through
the
Tyrol
to
Vienna
,
and
then
*NL*
returned
westward
,
through
Southern
Germany
.
The
autumn
found
him
at
*NL*
Baden-Baden
,
where
he
spent
several
weeks
.
The
place
was
charming
,
and
*NL*
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
depart
;
besides
,
he
was
looking
about
him
and
*NL*
deciding
what
to
do
for
the
winter
.
His
summer
had
been
very
full
,
and
*NL*
he
sat
under
the
great
trees
beside
the
miniature
river
that
trickles
*NL*
past
the
Baden
flower-beds
,
he
slowly
rummaged
it
over
.
He
had
seen
and
*NL*
done
a
great
deal
,
enjoyed
and
observed
a
great
deal
;
he
felt
older
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
felt
younger
too
.
He
remembered
Mr.
Babcock
and
his
desire
*NL*
to
form
conclusions
,
and
he
remembered
also
that
he
had
profited
very
*NL*
little
by
his
friend
's
exhortation
to
cultivate
the
same
respectable
*NL*
habit
.
Could
he
not
scrape
together
a
few
conclusions
?
Baden-Baden
*NL*
was
the
prettiest
place
he
had
seen
yet
,
and
orchestral
music
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
under
the
stars
,
was
decidedly
a
great
institution
.
This
was
*NL*
one
of
his
conclusions
!
But
he
went
on
to
reflect
that
he
had
done
very
*NL*
wisely
to
pull
up
stakes
and
come
abroad
;
this
seeing
of
the
world
was
*NL*
a
very
interesting
thing
.
He
had
learned
a
great
deal
;
he
could
n't
say
*NL*
just
what
,
but
he
had
it
there
under
his
hat-band
.
He
had
done
what
he
*NL*
wanted
;
he
had
seen
the
great
things
,
and
he
had
given
his
mind
a
chance
*NL*
to
``
improve
,
''
if
it
would
.
He
cheerfully
believed
that
it
had
improved
.
*NL*
Yes
,
this
seeing
of
the
world
was
very
pleasant
,
and
he
would
willingly
*NL*
do
a
little
more
of
it
.
Thirty-six
years
old
as
he
was
,
he
had
a
*NL*
handsome
stretch
of
life
before
him
yet
,
and
he
need
not
begin
to
*NL*
count
his
weeks
.
Where
should
he
take
the
world
next
?
I
have
said
he
*NL*
remembered
the
eyes
of
the
lady
whom
he
had
found
standing
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
's
drawing-room
;
four
months
had
elapsed
,
and
he
had
not
*NL*
forgotten
them
yet
.
He
had
looked
--
he
had
made
a
point
of
looking
--
into
*NL*
a
great
many
other
eyes
in
the
interval
,
but
the
only
ones
he
thought
*NL*
of
now
were
Madame
de
Cintre
's
.
If
he
wanted
to
see
more
of
the
world
,
*NL*
should
he
find
it
in
Madame
de
Cintre
's
eyes
?
He
would
certainly
find
*NL*
something
there
,
call
it
this
world
or
the
next
.
Throughout
these
rather
*NL*
formless
meditations
he
sometimes
thought
of
his
past
life
and
the
long
*NL*
array
of
years
-LRB-
they
had
begun
so
early
-RRB-
during
which
he
had
had
nothing
*NL*
in
his
head
but
``
enterprise
.
''
They
seemed
far
away
now
,
for
his
present
*NL*
attitude
was
more
than
a
holiday
,
it
was
almost
a
rupture
.
He
had
told
*NL*
Tristram
that
the
pendulum
was
swinging
back
and
it
appeared
that
the
*NL*
backward
swing
had
not
yet
ended
.
Still
``
enterprise
,
''
which
was
over
*NL*
in
the
other
quarter
wore
to
his
mind
a
different
aspect
at
different
*NL*
hours
.
In
its
train
a
thousand
forgotten
episodes
came
trooping
back
*NL*
into
his
memory
.
Some
of
them
he
looked
complacently
enough
in
the
face
;
*NL*
from
some
he
averted
his
head
.
They
were
old
efforts
,
old
exploits
,
*NL*
antiquated
examples
of
``
smartness
''
and
sharpness
.
Some
of
them
,
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
them
,
he
felt
decidedly
proud
of
;
he
admired
himself
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
looking
at
another
man
.
And
,
in
fact
,
many
of
the
qualities
*NL*
that
make
a
great
deed
were
there
:
the
decision
,
the
resolution
,
the
*NL*
courage
,
the
celerity
,
the
clear
eye
,
and
the
strong
hand
.
Of
certain
*NL*
other
achievements
it
would
be
going
too
far
to
say
that
he
was
ashamed
*NL*
of
them
for
Newman
had
never
had
a
stomach
for
dirty
work
.
He
was
*NL*
blessed
with
a
natural
impulse
to
disfigure
with
a
direct
,
unreasoning
*NL*
blow
the
comely
visage
of
temptation
.
And
certainly
,
in
no
man
could
a
*NL*
want
of
integrity
have
been
less
excusable
.
Newman
knew
the
crooked
from
*NL*
the
straight
at
a
glance
,
and
the
former
had
cost
him
,
first
and
last
,
*NL*
a
great
many
moments
of
lively
disgust
.
But
none
the
less
some
of
his
*NL*
memories
seemed
to
wear
at
present
a
rather
graceless
and
sordid
mien
,
*NL*
and
it
struck
him
that
if
he
had
never
done
anything
very
ugly
,
he
had
*NL*
never
,
on
the
other
hand
,
done
anything
particularly
beautiful
.
He
had
*NL*
spent
his
years
in
the
unremitting
effort
to
add
thousands
to
thousands
,
*NL*
and
,
now
that
he
stood
well
outside
of
it
,
the
business
of
money-getting
*NL*
appeared
tolerably
dry
and
sterile
.
It
is
very
well
to
sneer
at
*NL*
money-getting
after
you
have
filled
your
pockets
,
and
Newman
,
it
may
be
*NL*
said
,
should
have
begun
somewhat
earlier
to
moralize
thus
delicately
.
To
*NL*
this
it
may
be
answered
that
he
might
have
made
another
fortune
,
if
he
*NL*
chose
;
and
we
ought
to
add
that
he
was
not
exactly
moralizing
.
It
had
*NL*
come
back
to
him
simply
that
what
he
had
been
looking
at
all
summer
was
*NL*
a
very
rich
and
beautiful
world
,
and
that
it
had
not
all
been
made
by
*NL*
sharp
railroad
men
and
stock-brokers
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
stay
at
Baden-Baden
he
received
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Tristram
,
*NL*
scolding
him
for
the
scanty
tidings
he
had
sent
to
his
friends
of
the
*NL*
Avenue
d'Iena
,
and
begging
to
be
definitely
informed
that
he
had
not
*NL*
concocted
any
horrid
scheme
for
wintering
in
outlying
regions
,
but
was
*NL*
coming
back
sanely
and
promptly
to
the
most
comfortable
city
in
the
*NL*
world
.
Newman
's
answer
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
supposed
you
knew
I
was
a
miserable
letter-writer
,
and
did
n't
expect
*NL*
anything
of
me
.
I
do
n't
think
I
have
written
twenty
letters
of
pure
*NL*
friendship
in
my
whole
life
;
in
America
I
conducted
my
correspondence
*NL*
altogether
by
telegrams
.
This
is
a
letter
of
pure
friendship
;
you
have
*NL*
got
hold
of
a
curiosity
,
and
I
hope
you
will
value
it
.
You
want
to
know
*NL*
everything
that
has
happened
to
me
these
three
months
.
The
best
way
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
I
think
,
would
be
to
send
you
my
half
dozen
guide-books
,
with
*NL*
my
pencil-marks
in
the
margin
.
Wherever
you
find
a
scratch
or
a
cross
,
*NL*
or
a
`
Beautiful
!
'
or
a
`
So
true
!
'
or
a
`
Too
thin
!
'
you
may
know
that
*NL*
I
have
had
a
sensation
of
some
sort
or
other
.
That
has
been
about
my
*NL*
history
,
ever
since
I
left
you
.
Belgium
,
Holland
,
Switzerland
,
Germany
,
*NL*
Italy
,
I
have
been
through
the
whole
list
,
and
I
do
n't
think
I
am
any
*NL*
the
worse
for
it
.
I
know
more
about
Madonnas
and
church-steeples
than
I
*NL*
supposed
any
man
could
.
I
have
seen
some
very
pretty
things
,
and
shall
*NL*
perhaps
talk
them
over
this
winter
,
by
your
fireside
.
You
see
,
my
face
*NL*
is
not
altogether
set
against
Paris
.
I
have
had
all
kinds
of
plans
and
*NL*
visions
,
but
your
letter
has
blown
most
of
them
away
.
`
L'appetit
vient
*NL*
en
mangeant
,
'
says
the
French
proverb
,
and
I
find
that
the
more
I
see
*NL*
of
the
world
the
more
I
want
to
see
.
Now
that
I
am
in
the
shafts
,
why
*NL*
should
n't
I
trot
to
the
end
of
the
course
?
Sometimes
I
think
of
the
*NL*
far
East
,
and
keep
rolling
the
names
of
Eastern
cities
under
my
tongue
:
*NL*
Damascus
and
Bagdad
,
Medina
and
Mecca
.
I
spent
a
week
last
month
in
the
*NL*
company
of
a
returned
missionary
,
who
told
me
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
*NL*
be
loafing
about
Europe
when
there
are
such
big
things
to
be
seen
out
*NL*
there
.
I
do
want
to
explore
,
but
I
think
I
would
rather
explore
over
in
*NL*
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
.
Do
you
ever
hear
from
that
pretty
lady
?
If
you
*NL*
can
get
her
to
promise
she
will
be
at
home
the
next
time
I
call
,
I
will
*NL*
go
back
to
Paris
straight
.
I
am
more
than
ever
in
the
state
of
mind
I
*NL*
told
you
about
that
evening
;
I
want
a
first-class
wife
.
I
have
kept
an
*NL*
eye
on
all
the
pretty
girls
I
have
come
across
this
summer
,
but
none
of
*NL*
them
came
up
to
my
notion
,
or
anywhere
near
it
.
I
should
have
enjoyed
*NL*
all
this
a
thousand
times
more
if
I
had
had
the
lady
just
mentioned
*NL*
by
my
side
.
The
nearest
approach
to
her
was
a
Unitarian
minister
from
*NL*
Boston
,
who
very
soon
demanded
a
separation
,
for
incompatibility
of
*NL*
temper
.
He
told
me
I
was
low-minded
,
immoral
,
a
devotee
of
`
art
for
*NL*
art
'
--
whatever
that
is
:
all
of
which
greatly
afflicted
me
,
for
he
*NL*
was
really
a
sweet
little
fellow
.
But
shortly
afterwards
I
met
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
with
whom
I
struck
up
an
acquaintance
which
at
first
seemed
*NL*
to
promise
well
--
a
very
bright
man
,
who
writes
in
the
London
papers
*NL*
and
knows
Paris
nearly
as
well
as
Tristram
.
We
knocked
about
for
a
week
*NL*
together
,
but
he
very
soon
gave
me
up
in
disgust
.
I
was
too
virtuous
by
*NL*
half
;
I
was
too
stern
a
moralist
.
He
told
me
,
in
a
friendly
way
,
that
I
*NL*
was
cursed
with
a
conscience
;
that
I
judged
things
like
a
Methodist
and
*NL*
talked
about
them
like
an
old
lady
.
This
was
rather
bewildering
.
Which
*NL*
of
my
two
critics
was
I
to
believe
?
I
did
n't
worry
about
it
and
very
*NL*
soon
made
up
my
mind
they
were
both
idiots
.
But
there
is
one
thing
in
*NL*
which
no
one
will
ever
have
the
impudence
to
pretend
I
am
wrong
,
that
*NL*
is
,
in
being
your
faithful
friend

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
up
Damascus
and
Bagdad
and
returned
to
Paris
before
the
*NL*
autumn
was
over
.
He
established
himself
in
some
rooms
selected
for
him
*NL*
by
Tom
Tristram
,
in
accordance
with
the
latter
's
estimate
of
what
he
*NL*
called
his
social
position
.
When
Newman
learned
that
his
social
position
*NL*
was
to
be
taken
into
account
,
he
professed
himself
utterly
incompetent
,
*NL*
and
begged
Tristram
to
relieve
him
of
the
care
.
``
I
did
n't
know
I
had
a
*NL*
social
position
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
if
I
have
,
I
have
n't
the
smallest
idea
*NL*
what
it
is
.
Is
n't
a
social
position
knowing
some
two
or
three
thousand
*NL*
people
and
inviting
them
to
dinner
?
I
know
you
and
your
wife
and
little
*NL*
old
Mr.
Nioche
,
who
gave
me
French
lessons
last
spring
.
Can
I
invite
you
*NL*
to
dinner
to
meet
each
other
?
If
I
can
,
you
must
come
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
very
grateful
to
me
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
who
introduced
*NL*
you
last
year
to
every
creature
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
;
I
had
quite
forgotten
.
But
I
thought
you
wanted
me
to
*NL*
forget
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
that
tone
of
simple
deliberateness
which
*NL*
frequently
marked
his
utterance
,
and
which
an
observer
would
not
have
*NL*
known
whether
to
pronounce
a
somewhat
mysteriously
humorous
affection
of
*NL*
ignorance
or
a
modest
aspiration
to
knowledge
;
``
you
told
me
you
disliked
*NL*
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
way
you
remember
what
I
say
is
at
least
very
flattering
.
But
*NL*
in
future
,
''
added
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
pray
forget
all
the
wicked
things
and
*NL*
remember
only
the
good
ones
.
It
will
be
easily
done
,
and
it
will
not
*NL*
fatigue
your
memory
.
But
I
forewarn
you
that
if
you
trust
my
husband
to
*NL*
pick
out
your
rooms
,
you
are
in
for
something
hideous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hideous
,
darling
?
''
cried
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
I
must
say
nothing
wicked
;
otherwise
I
should
use
stronger
*NL*
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
she
would
say
,
Newman
?
''
asked
Tristram
.
``
If
she
*NL*
really
tried
,
now
?
She
can
express
displeasure
,
volubly
,
in
two
or
three
*NL*
languages
;
that
's
what
it
is
to
be
intellectual
.
It
gives
her
the
start
*NL*
of
me
completely
,
for
I
ca
n't
swear
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
except
in
*NL*
English
.
When
I
get
mad
I
have
to
fall
back
on
our
dear
old
mother
*NL*
tongue
.
There
's
nothing
like
it
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
declared
that
he
knew
nothing
about
tables
and
chairs
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
accept
,
in
the
way
of
a
lodging
,
with
his
eyes
shut
,
anything
*NL*
that
Tristram
should
offer
him
.
This
was
partly
veracity
on
our
hero
's
*NL*
part
,
but
it
was
also
partly
charity
.
He
knew
that
to
pry
about
and
look
*NL*
at
rooms
,
and
make
people
open
windows
,
and
poke
into
sofas
with
his
*NL*
cane
,
and
gossip
with
landladies
,
and
ask
who
lived
above
and
who
*NL*
below
--
he
knew
that
this
was
of
all
pastimes
the
dearest
to
Tristram
's
*NL*
heart
,
and
he
felt
the
more
disposed
to
put
it
in
his
way
as
he
was
*NL*
conscious
that
,
as
regards
his
obliging
friend
,
he
had
suffered
the
*NL*
warmth
of
ancient
good-fellowship
somewhat
to
abate
.
Besides
,
he
had
no
*NL*
taste
for
upholstery
;
he
had
even
no
very
exquisite
sense
of
comfort
*NL*
or
convenience
.
He
had
a
relish
for
luxury
and
splendor
,
but
it
was
*NL*
satisfied
by
rather
gross
contrivances
.
He
scarcely
knew
a
hard
chair
*NL*
from
a
soft
one
,
and
he
possessed
a
talent
for
stretching
his
legs
which
*NL*
quite
dispensed
with
adventitious
facilities
.
His
idea
of
comfort
was
to
*NL*
inhabit
very
large
rooms
,
have
a
great
many
of
them
,
and
be
conscious
of
*NL*
their
possessing
a
number
of
patented
mechanical
devices
--
half
of
which
*NL*
he
should
never
have
occasion
to
use
.
The
apartments
should
be
light
and
*NL*
brilliant
and
lofty
;
he
had
once
said
that
he
liked
rooms
in
which
you
*NL*
wanted
to
keep
your
hat
on
.
For
the
rest
,
he
was
satisfied
with
the
*NL*
assurance
of
any
respectable
person
that
everything
was
``
handsome
.
''
*NL*
Tristram
accordingly
secured
for
him
an
apartment
to
which
this
epithet
*NL*
might
be
lavishly
applied
.
It
was
situated
on
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
,
*NL*
on
the
first
floor
,
and
consisted
of
a
series
of
rooms
,
gilded
from
*NL*
floor
to
ceiling
a
foot
thick
,
draped
in
various
light
shades
of
satin
,
*NL*
and
chiefly
furnished
with
mirrors
and
clocks
.
Newman
thought
them
*NL*
magnificent
,
thanked
Tristram
heartily
,
immediately
took
possession
,
and
*NL*
had
one
of
his
trunks
standing
for
three
months
in
his
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Mrs.
Tristram
told
him
that
her
beautiful
friend
,
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
,
had
returned
from
the
country
;
that
she
had
met
her
three
days
*NL*
before
,
coming
out
of
the
Church
of
St.
Sulpice
;
she
herself
having
*NL*
journeyed
to
that
distant
quarter
in
quest
of
an
obscure
lace-mender
,
of
*NL*
whose
skill
she
had
heard
high
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
were
those
eyes
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
,
if
you
please
!
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
``
She
had
been
to
confession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
tally
with
your
account
of
her
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
she
*NL*
should
have
sins
to
confess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
not
sins
;
they
were
sufferings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
;
I
went
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
she
suffer
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
ask
her
.
With
her
,
somehow
,
one
is
very
discreet
.
But
I
*NL*
guessed
,
easily
enough
.
She
suffers
from
her
wicked
old
mother
and
her
*NL*
Grand
Turk
of
a
brother
.
They
persecute
her
.
But
I
can
almost
forgive
*NL*
them
,
because
,
as
I
told
you
,
she
is
a
saint
,
and
a
persecution
is
all
*NL*
that
she
needs
to
bring
out
her
saintliness
and
make
her
perfect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
comfortable
theory
for
her
.
I
hope
you
will
never
impart
it
*NL*
to
the
old
folks
.
Why
does
she
let
them
bully
her
?
Is
she
not
her
own
*NL*
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Legally
,
yes
,
I
suppose
;
but
morally
,
no
.
In
France
you
must
never
say
*NL*
nay
to
your
mother
,
whatever
she
requires
of
you
.
She
may
be
the
most
*NL*
abominable
old
woman
in
the
world
,
and
make
your
life
a
purgatory
;
but
,
*NL*
after
all
,
she
is
ma
mere
,
and
you
have
no
right
to
judge
her
.
You
have
*NL*
simply
to
obey
.
The
thing
has
a
fine
side
to
it
.
Madame
de
Cintre
bows
*NL*
her
head
and
folds
her
wings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
she
at
least
make
her
brother
leave
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
brother
is
the
chef
de
la
famille
,
as
they
say
;
he
is
the
head
of
*NL*
the
clan
.
With
those
people
the
family
is
everything
;
you
must
act
,
not
*NL*
for
your
own
pleasure
,
but
for
the
advantage
of
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what
my
family
would
like
me
to
do
!

exclaimed
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
had
one

said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
they
want
to
get
out

poor

Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another

Newman
continued

*NL*
``

naturally
objects

It
appears
that
the

they
made
rather
a
poor
bargain

M.

left

property

*NL*
``
And
to
whom
do

*NL*
``
I
thought
it
best
not
to
ask

you
may
be
sure
it
is
to
some
horrid
*NL*
old
nabob
,
or
to
some
dissipated
little
duke

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Mrs.
Tristram
,
as
large
as
life
!
''
cried
her
husband
.
``
Observe
*NL*
the
richness
of
her
imagination

She
has
not
a
single
question
--
it
's
*NL*
vulgar
to
ask
questions
--
and
yet
she
knows
everything
.
She
has
the
*NL*
history
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
marriage
at
her
fingers

ends
.
She
has
*NL*
seen
the
lovely
Claire
on
her
knees
,
with
loosened
tresses
and
streaming
*NL*
eyes
,
and
the
rest
of
them
standing
over

goads

*NL*
red-hot
irons
,
ready
to
come
down
on
her
if
she
refuses
the
tipsy
duke

*NL*
The
simple
truth
is
that
they
made
a
fuss
about
her
milliner

bill
or
*NL*
refused
her
an
opera-box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
from
Tristram
to
his
wife
with
a
certain
mistrust
in
each
*NL*
direction
.
``
Do
you
really
mean
,
''
he
asked
of
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
that
your
*NL*
friend
is
being
forced
into
an
unhappy
marriage
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
extremely
probable

people
are
very
capable
of
that

sort
of
thing

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
something
in
a
play

said
Newman
;
``
that
dark
old
house
over

there
looks
as

wicked
things
had
been
done
in
it

be
done
*NL*
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
a
still
darker

during
the
summer
this

hatched

*NL*
*NL*
``
MUST
have

that

Tristram

*NL*
*NL*
``
After

suggested
Newman

after
a
silence

Mrs.

Tristram
,
with
rich
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
while
,
and
seemed
lost
in
meditation
.
``
Is
it
*NL*
possible
,
''
he
asked
at
last
,
``
that
they
do
that
sort

thing
over
here

that
helpless

are
bullied
into

*NL*
*NL*
``
Helpless

``
A
great

Tristram

``
Girls

very
gravely

*NL*
Newman
,
for
some
moments
,
answered
nothing
;
but
presently
,
``
I
should
*NL*
suppose
she
had
heard
enough
of
marrying

he
said
.
``
The
kindest
way
to

But
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
is
infamous

he
added
;
``
it
makes
me
feel
savage
to
hear

*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
of
it
,
however
,
more
than
once
afterward
.
Mrs.
Tristram
again
*NL*
saw
Madame
de
Cintre
,
and
again
found
her
looking
very
sad
.
But
on
these
*NL*
occasions
there
had
been
no
tears
;
her
beautiful
eyes
were
clear
and
*NL*
still
.
``
She
is
cold
,
calm
,
and
hopeless
,
''
Mrs.
Tristram
declared
,
and
*NL*
she
added
that
on
her
mentioning
that
her
friend
Mr.
Newman
was
again
*NL*
in
Paris
and
was
faithful
in
his
desire
to
make
Madame
de
Cintre
's
*NL*
acquaintance
,
this
lovely
woman
had
found
a
smile
in
her
despair
,
and
*NL*
declared
that
she
was
sorry
to
have
missed
his
visit
in
the
spring
and
*NL*
that
she
hoped
he
had
not
lost
courage
.
``
I
told
her
something
about
*NL*
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
comfort

Newman
,
placidly
.
``
I
like

know

*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
this
,
one
dusky
autumn
afternoon
,
he
went
again
to
the
*NL*
Rue
de
l'Universite
.
The
early
evening
had
closed
in
as
he
applied
for
*NL*
admittance
at
the
stoutly
guarded
Hotel
de
Bellegarde
.
He
was
told
that
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
was
at
home
;
he
crossed
the
court
,
entered
the
farther
*NL*
door
,
and
was
conducted
through
a
vestibule
,
vast
,
dim
,
and
cold
,
up
a
*NL*
broad
stone
staircase
with
an
ancient
iron
balustrade
,
to
an
apartment
*NL*
on
the
second
floor
.
Announced
and
ushered
in
,
he
found
himself
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
paneled
boudoir
,
at
one
end
of
which
a
lady
and
gentleman
were
*NL*
seated
before
the
fire
.
The
gentleman
was
smoking
a
cigarette
;
there
was
*NL*
no
light
in
the
room
save
that
of
a
couple
of
candles
and
the
glow
from
*NL*
the
hearth
.
Both
persons
rose
to
welcome
Newman
,
who
,
in
the
firelight
,
*NL*
recognized
Madame
de
Cintre
.
She
gave
him
her
hand
with
a
smile
which
*NL*
seemed
in
itself
an
illumination
,
and
,
pointing
to
her
companion
,
said
*NL*
softly
,
``
My
brother
.
''
The
gentleman
offered
Newman
a
frank
,
friendly
*NL*
greeting
,
and
our
hero
then
perceived
him
to
be
the
young
man
who
had
*NL*
spoken
to
him
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
on
his
former
visit
and
who
had
*NL*
struck
him
as
a
good
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Tristram
has
spoken
to
me
a
great
deal
of
you
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
gently
,
as
she
resumed
her
former
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
after
he
had
seated
himself
,
began
to
consider
what
,
in
truth
,
*NL*
was
his
errand
.
He
had
an
unusual
,
unexpected
sense
of
having
wandered
*NL*
into
a
strange
corner
of
the
world
.
He
was
not
given
,
as
a
general
*NL*
thing
,
to
anticipating
danger
,
or
forecasting
disaster
,
and
he
had
had
*NL*
no
social
tremors
on
this
particular
occasion
.
He
was
not
timid
and
he
*NL*
was
not
impudent
.
He
felt
too
kindly
toward
himself
to
be
the
one
,
and
*NL*
too
good-naturedly
toward
the
rest
of
the
world
to
be
the
other
.
But
his
*NL*
native
shrewdness
sometimes
placed
his
ease
of
temper
at
its
mercy
;
with
*NL*
every
disposition
to
take
things
simply
,
it
was
obliged
to
perceive
that
*NL*
some
things
were
not
so
simple
as
others
.
He
felt
as
one
does
in
missing
*NL*
a
step
,
in
an
ascent
,
where
one
expected
to
find
it
.
This
strange
,
*NL*
pretty
woman
,
sitting
in
fire-side
talk
with
her
brother
,
in
the
gray
*NL*
depths
of
her
inhospitable-looking
house
--
what
had
he
to
say
to
her
?
She
*NL*
seemed
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
fantastic
privacy
;
on
what
grounds
had
he
*NL*
pulled
away
the
curtain
?
For
a
moment
he
felt
as
if
he
had
plunged
into
*NL*
some
medium
as
deep
as
the
ocean
,
and
as
if
he
must
exert
himself
to
*NL*
keep
from
sinking
.
Meanwhile
he
was
looking
at
Madame
de
Cintre
,
and
*NL*
she
was
settling
herself
in
her
chair
and
drawing
in
her
long
dress
and
*NL*
turning
her
face
towards
him
.
Their
eyes
met
;
a
moment
afterwards
she
*NL*
looked
away
and
motioned
to
her
brother
to
put
a
log
on
the
fire
.
But
*NL*
the
moment
,
and
the
glance
which
traversed
it
,
had
been
sufficient
to
*NL*
relieve
Newman
of
the
first
and
the
last
fit
of
personal
embarrassment
*NL*
he
was
ever
to
know
.
He
performed
the
movement
which
was
so
frequent
*NL*
with
him
,
and
which
was
always
a
sort
of
symbol
of
his
taking
mental
*NL*
possession
of
a
scene
--
he
extended
his
legs
.
The
impression
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
had
made
upon
him
on
their
first
meeting
came
back
in
an
instant
;
*NL*
it
had
been
deeper
than
he
knew
.
She
was
pleasing
,
she
was
interesting
;
*NL*
he
had
opened
a
book
and
the
first
lines
held
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
him
several
questions
:
how
lately
he
had
seen
Mrs.
Tristram
,
*NL*
how
long
he
had
been
in
Paris
,
how
long
he
expected
to
remain
there
,
how
*NL*
he
liked
it
.
She
spoke
English
without
an
accent
,
or
rather
with
that
*NL*
distinctively
British
accent
which
,
on
his
arrival
in
Europe
,
had
struck
*NL*
Newman
as
an
altogether
foreign
tongue
,
but
which
,
in
women
,
he
had
come
*NL*
to
like
extremely
.
Here
and
there
Madame
de
Cintre
's
utterance
had
a
*NL*
faint
shade
of
strangeness
but
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
Newman
found
*NL*
himself
waiting
for
these
soft
roughnesses
.
He
enjoyed
them
,
and
he
*NL*
marveled
to
see
that
gross
thing
,
error
,
brought
down
to
so
fine
a
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
beautiful
country
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
magnificent
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
ought
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
see
it
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
travel
;
especially
so
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
go
away
sometimes
;
you
are
not
always
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
go
away
in
summer
,
a
little
way
,
to
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
wanted
to
ask
her
something
more
,
something
personal
,
he
hardly
*NL*
knew
what
.
``
Do
n't
you
find
it
rather
--
rather
quiet
here
?
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
so
far
from
the
street
?
''
Rather
``
gloomy
,
''
he
was
going
to
say
,
but
he
*NL*
reflected
that
that
would
be
impolite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
very
quiet
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
;
``
but
we
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
like
that
,
''
repeated
Newman
,
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
I
have
lived
here
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lived
here
all
your
life
,
''
said
Newman
,
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
born
here
,
and
my
father
was
born
here
before
me
,
and
my
*NL*
grandfather
,
and
my
great-grandfathers
.
Were
they
not
,
Valentin
?
''
and
*NL*
she
appealed
to
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
family
habit
to
be
born
here
!
''
the
young
man
said
with
a
*NL*
laugh
,
and
rose
and
threw
the
remnant
of
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
then
remained
leaning
against
the
chimney-piece
.
An
observer
would
*NL*
have
perceived
that
he
wished
to
take
a
better
look
at
Newman
,
whom
he
*NL*
covertly
examined
,
while
he
stood
stroking
his
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
house
is
tremendously
old
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
is
it
,
brother
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
took
the
two
candles
from
the
mantel-shelf
,
lifted
one
*NL*
high
in
each
hand
,
and
looked
up
toward
the
cornice
of
the
room
,
above
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
.
This
latter
feature
of
the
apartment
was
of
white
*NL*
marble
,
and
in
the
familiar
rococo
style
of
the
last
century
;
but
above
*NL*
it
was
a
paneling
of
an
earlier
date
,
quaintly
carved
,
painted
white
,
*NL*
and
gilded
here
and
there
.
The
white
had
turned
to
yellow
,
and
the
*NL*
gilding
was
tarnished
.
On
the
top
,
the
figures
ranged
themselves
into
*NL*
a
sort
of
shield
,
on
which
an
armorial
device
was
cut
.
Above
it
,
in
*NL*
relief
,
was
a
date
--
1627
.
``
There
you
have
it
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
``
That
*NL*
is
old
or
new
,
according
to
your
point
of
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
over
here
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
one
's
point
of
view
gets
shifted
round
*NL*
considerably
.
''
And
he
threw
back
his
head
and
looked
about
the
room
.
*NL*
``
Your
house
is
of
a
very
curious
style
of
architecture
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
interested
in
architecture
?
''
asked
the
young
man
at
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
took
the
trouble
,
this
summer
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
to
examine
--
as
*NL*
well
as
I
can
calculate
--
some
four
hundred
and
seventy
churches
.
Do
you
*NL*
call
that
interested
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
are
interested
in
theology
,
''
said
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
particularly
.
Are
you
a
Roman
Catholic
,
madam
?
''
And
he
turned
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
she
answered
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
struck
with
the
gravity
of
her
tone
;
he
threw
back
his
head
*NL*
and
began
to
look
round
the
room
again
.
``
Had
you
never
noticed
that
*NL*
number
up
there
?
''
he
presently
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
In
former
years
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
had
been
watching
Newman
's
movement
.
``
Perhaps
you
would
like
*NL*
to
examine
the
house
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
slowly
brought
down
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
;
he
had
a
vague
*NL*
impression
that
the
young
man
at
the
chimney-piece
was
inclined
to
*NL*
irony
.
He
was
a
handsome
fellow
,
his
face
wore
a
smile
,
his
mustaches
*NL*
were
curled
up
at
the
ends
,
and
there
was
a
little
dancing
gleam
in
his
*NL*
eye
.
``
Damn
his
French
impudence
!
''
Newman
was
on
the
point
of
saying
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
What
the
deuce
is
he
grinning
at
?
''
He
glanced
at
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
;
she
was
sitting
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
floor
.
She
raised
*NL*
them
,
they
met
his
,
and
she
looked
at
her
brother
.
Newman
turned
again
*NL*
to
this
young
man
and
observed
that
he
strikingly
resembled
his
sister
.
*NL*
This
was
in
his
favor
,
and
our
hero
's
first
impression
of
the
Count
*NL*
Valentin
,
moreover
,
had
been
agreeable
.
His
mistrust
expired
,
and
he
*NL*
said
he
would
be
very
glad
to
see
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
gave
a
frank
laugh
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
one
of
the
*NL*
candlesticks
.
``
Good
,
good
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Come
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Madame
de
Cintre
rose
quickly
and
grasped
his
arm
,
``
Ah
,
Valentin
!
''
*NL*
she
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
show
Mr.
Newman
the
house
.
It
will
be
very
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
and
turned
to
Newman
with
a
smile
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
let
him
take
you
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
will
not
find
it
amusing
.
It
is
a
*NL*
musty
old
house
,
like
any
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
full
of
curious
things
,
''
said
the
count
,
resisting
.
``
Besides
,
I
*NL*
want
to
do
it
;
it
is
a
rare
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
wicked
,
brother
,
''
Madame
de
Cintre
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
!
''
cried
the
young
man
.
``
Will
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
stepped
toward
Newman
,
gently
clasping
her
hands
and
*NL*
smiling
softly
.
``
Would
you
not
prefer
my
society
,
here
,
by
my
fire
,
to
*NL*
stumbling
about
dark
passages
after
my
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
times
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
We
will
see
the
house
some
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
put
down
his
candlestick
with
mock
solemnity
,
and
,
shaking
*NL*
his
head
,
``
Ah
,
you
have
defeated
a
great
scheme
,
sir
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
scheme
?
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
played
your
part
in
it
all
the
better
.
Perhaps
some
day
*NL*
I
shall
have
a
chance
to
explain
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
and
ring
for
the
tea
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
obeyed
,
and
presently
a
servant
brought
in
the
tea
,
placed
*NL*
the
tray
on
a
small
table
,
and
departed
.
Madame
de
Cintre
,
from
her
*NL*
place
,
busied
herself
with
making
it
.
She
had
but
just
begun
when
the
*NL*
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
lady
rushed
in
,
making
a
loud
rustling
sound
.
*NL*
She
stared
at
Newman
,
gave
a
little
nod
and
a
``
Monsieur
!
''
and
then
*NL*
quickly
approached
Madame
de
Cintre
and
presented
her
forehead
to
be
*NL*
kissed
.
Madame
de
Cintre
saluted
her
,
and
continued
to
make
tea
.
The
*NL*
new-comer
was
young
and
pretty
,
it
seemed
to
Newman
;
she
wore
her
bonnet
*NL*
and
cloak
,
and
a
train
of
royal
proportions
.
She
began
to
talk
rapidly
*NL*
in
French
.
``
Oh
,
give
me
some
tea
,
my
beautiful
one
,
for
the
love
of
God
!
*NL*
I
'm
exhausted
,
mangled
,
massacred
.
''
Newman
found
himself
quite
unable
to
*NL*
follow
her
;
she
spoke
much
less
distinctly
than
M.
Nioche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
sister-in-law
,
''
said
the
Count
Valentin
,
leaning
towards
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
pretty
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exquisite
,
''
answered
the
young
man
,
and
this
time
,
again
,
Newman
*NL*
suspected
him
of
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
sister-in-law
came
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
fire
with
her
cup
*NL*
of
tea
in
her
hand
,
holding
it
out
at
arm
's
-
length
,
so
that
she
might
*NL*
not
spill
it
on
her
dress
,
and
uttering
little
cries
of
alarm
.
She
*NL*
placed
the
cup
on
the
mantel-shelf
and
begun
to
unpin
her
veil
and
pull
*NL*
off
her
gloves
,
looking
meanwhile
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
thing
I
can
do
for
you
,
my
dear
lady
?
''
the
Count
Valentin
*NL*
asked
,
in
a
sort
of
mock-caressing
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Present
monsieur
,
''
said
his
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
answered
,
``
Mr.
Newman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
courtesy
to
you
,
monsieur
,
or
I
shall
spill
my
tea
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lady
.
``
So
Claire
receives
strangers
,
like
that
?
''
she
added
,
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
in
French
,
to
her
brother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
!
''
he
answered
with
a
smile
.
Newman
stood
a
moment
,
and
then
*NL*
he
approached
Madame
de
Cintre
.
She
looked
up
at
him
as
if
she
were
*NL*
thinking
of
something
to
say
.
But
she
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
;
so
she
*NL*
simply
smiled
.
He
sat
down
near
her
and
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
.
For
*NL*
a
few
moments
they
talked
about
that
,
and
meanwhile
he
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
He
remembered
what
Mrs.
Tristram
had
told
him
of
her
``
perfection
''
and
of
*NL*
her
having
,
in
combination
,
all
the
brilliant
things
that
he
dreamed
*NL*
of
finding
.
This
made
him
observe
her
not
only
without
mistrust
,
but
*NL*
without
uneasy
conjectures
;
the
presumption
,
from
the
first
moment
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
,
had
been
in
her
favor
.
And
yet
,
if
she
was
beautiful
,
it
*NL*
was
not
a
dazzling
beauty
.
She
was
tall
and
moulded
in
long
lines
;
*NL*
she
had
thick
fair
hair
,
a
wide
forehead
,
and
features
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
harmonious
irregularity
.
Her
clear
gray
eyes
were
strikingly
expressive
;
*NL*
they
were
both
gentle
and
intelligent
,
and
Newman
liked
them
immensely
;
*NL*
but
they
had
not
those
depths
of
splendor
--
those
many-colored
*NL*
rays
--
which
illumine
the
brows
of
famous
beauties
.
Madame
de
Cintre
was
*NL*
rather
thin
,
and
she
looked
younger
than
probably
she
was
.
In
her
whole
*NL*
person
there
was
something
both
youthful
and
subdued
,
slender
and
*NL*
yet
ample
,
tranquil
yet
shy
;
a
mixture
of
immaturity
and
repose
,
of
*NL*
innocence
and
dignity
.
What
had
Tristram
meant
,
Newman
wondered
,
by
*NL*
calling
her
proud
?
She
was
certainly
not
proud
now
,
to
him
;
or
if
she
*NL*
was
,
it
was
of
no
use
,
it
was
lost
upon
him
;
she
must
pile
it
up
higher
*NL*
if
she
expected
him
to
mind
it
.
She
was
a
beautiful
woman
,
and
it
was
*NL*
very
easy
to
get
on
with
her
.
Was
she
a
countess
,
a
marquise
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
historical
formation
?
Newman
,
who
had
rarely
heard
these
words
used
,
*NL*
had
never
been
at
pains
to
attach
any
particular
image
to
them
;
but
they
*NL*
occurred
to
him
now
and
seemed
charged
with
a
sort
of
melodious
meaning
.
*NL*
They
signified
something
fair
and
softly
bright
,
that
had
easy
motions
*NL*
and
spoke
very
agreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
many
friends
in
Paris
;
do
you
go
out
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Cintre
,
*NL*
who
had
at
last
thought
of
something
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
do
I
dance
,
and
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
go
dans
le
monde
,
as
we
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
a
good
many
people
.
Mrs.
Tristram
has
taken
me
about
.
I
do
*NL*
whatever
she
tells
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
yourself
,
you
are
not
fond
of
amusements
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
of
some
sorts
.
I
am
not
fond
of
dancing
,
and
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
;
I
am
too
old
and
sober
.
But
I
want
to
be
amused
;
I
came
to
Europe
*NL*
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
be
amused
in
America
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
;
I
was
always
at
work
.
But
after
all
,
that
was
my
*NL*
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Madame
de
Bellegarde
came
back
for
another
cup
of
tea
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
the
Count
Valentin
.
Madame
de
Cintre
,
when
she
had
served
*NL*
her
,
began
to
talk
again
with
Newman
,
and
recalling
what
he
had
last
*NL*
said
,
``
In
your
own
country
you
were
very
much
occupied
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
business
.
I
have
been
in
business
since
I
was
fifteen
years
*NL*
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
your
business
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
who
was
*NL*
decidedly
not
so
pretty
as
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
everything
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
At
one
time
I
sold
leather
;
*NL*
at
one
time
I
manufactured
wash-tubs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
made
a
little
grimace
.
``
Leather
?
I
do
n't
like
that
.
*NL*
Wash-tubs
are
better
.
I
prefer
the
smell
of
soap
.
I
hope
at
least
they
*NL*
made
your
fortune
.
''
She
rattled
this
off
with
the
air
of
a
woman
who
had
*NL*
the
reputation
of
saying
everything
that
came
into
her
head
,
and
with
a
*NL*
strong
French
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
spoken
with
cheerful
seriousness
,
but
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
tone
made
him
go
on
,
after
a
meditative
pause
,
with
a
certain
light
*NL*
grimness
of
jocularity
.
``
No
,
I
lost
money
on
wash-tubs
,
but
I
came
out
*NL*
pretty
square
on
leather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
after
all
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
that
*NL*
the
great
point
is
--
how
do
you
call
it

--
to
come
out
square

I
am
on
my
*NL*
knees
to
money
;
I
do
n't
deny
it

If
you
have
it

I
ask
no

For
*NL*
that
I
am
a
real
democrat
--
like
you
,
monsieur

Madame
de
Cintre
is
very
*NL*
proud
;
but
I
find
that
one
gets
much
more
pleasure
in
this
sad
life
if
*NL*
one
does
n't
look
too
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
Heaven
,
dear
madam
,
how
you
go
at
it
,
''
said
the
Count
Valentin
,
*NL*
lowering
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
man
one
can
speak
to

I
suppose
,
since
my

receives
him

*NL*
the
lady
answered
.
``
Besides

it
's
very
true
;
those
are
my
ideas

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
call
them
ideas

''
murmured
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mrs.
Tristram
told
me
you
had
been
in
the
army

in
your
war

said
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
that
is
not

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true

said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
``
Otherwise
perhaps
I
should
not
be
*NL*
penniless

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true

asked
Newman
in
a
moment
,
``
that
you
are
so
proud

I
had
*NL*
already
heard
it

*NL*
*NL*
Madame

Cintre
smiled
.
``
Do
you
find
me
so
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Newman
,
``
I
am
no
judge

are
proud
with

you
will
*NL*
have
to
tell
me

Otherwise
I
shall
not
know
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
began
to
laugh
.
``
That
would
be
pride
in
a
sad
*NL*
position
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
partly
,
''
Newman
went
on
,
``
because
I
should
n't
want
to
know
*NL*
it
.
I
want
you
to
treat
me
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
,
whose
laugh
had
ceased
,
looked
at
him
with
her
head
*NL*
half
averted
,
as
if
she
feared
what
he
was
going
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Tristram
told
you
the
literal
truth
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
I
want
very
*NL*
much
to
know
you

I
did
n't
come
here
simply
to
call
to-day

I
came
in
*NL*
the
hope
that
you
might
ask
me
to
come
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

come
often

''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
will
you
be
at
home
?
''
Newman
insisted
.
Even
to
himself
he
seemed
a
*NL*
trifle
``
pushing
,
''
but
he
was
,
in
truth
,
a
trifle
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
!
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
got
up
.
``
Well
,
we
shall
see
,
''
he
said
smoothing
his
hat
with
his
*NL*
coat-cuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
invite
Mr.
Newman
to
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Count
Valentin
looked
at
our
hero
from
head
to
foot
with
his
*NL*
peculiar
smile
,
in
which
impudence
and
urbanity
seemed
perplexingly
*NL*
commingled
.
``
Are
you
a
brave
man
?
''
he
asked
,
eying
him
askance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
so
,

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
suspect
so
.
In
that
case
,
come
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
an
invitation
!
''
murmured
Madame
de
Cintre
,
with
something
*NL*
painful
in
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
want
Mr.
Newman
to
come
--
particularly
,

said
the
young
man
.
``
It
*NL*
will
give
me
great
pleasure

I
shall
be
desolate
if
I
miss
one
of

visits

But
I
maintain
he
must
be
brave

A
stout
heart

And
he
*NL*
offered
Newman
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
come

see
you
;
I
shall
come
to
see

Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
need
all
the
more
courage

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Valentin
!

said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
appealingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly

cried
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
I
am
the
only
person
here

no

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
laugh
which
was
not
altogether
an
assent
,
and
took
his
*NL*
leave
.
Madame
de
Cintre
did
not
take
up
her
sister
's
challenge
to
be
*NL*
gracious

she
looked
with

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
very
late
,
about
a
week
after
his
visit
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
,
Newman
's
servant
brought
him
a
card
.
It
was
that
of
young
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
When
,
a
few
moments
later
,
he
went
to
receive
his
visitor
,
*NL*
he
found
him
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
great
gilded
parlor
and
eying
*NL*
it
from
cornice
to
carpet
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
face
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Newman
,
expressed
a
sense
of
lively
entertainment
.
``
What
the
devil
is
*NL*
he
laughing
at
now
?
''
our
hero
asked
himself
.
But
he
put
the
question
*NL*
without
acrimony
,
for
he
felt
that
Madame
de
Cintre
's
brother
was
a
good
*NL*
fellow
,
and
he
had
a
presentiment
that
on
this
basis
of
good
fellowship
*NL*
they
were
destined
to
understand
each
other
.
Only
,
if
there
was
anything
*NL*
to
laugh
at
,
he
wished
to
have
a
glimpse
of
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
begin
with
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
as
he
extended
his
hand
,
``
have
I
*NL*
come
too
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
late
for
what
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
smoke
a
cigar
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
to
come
early
to
do
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
do
n't
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
a
strong
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
keep
cigars
,
''
Newman
added
.
``
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
I
may
not
smoke
here
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
Is
the
room
too
small
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
large
.
It
is
like
smoking
in
a
ball-room
,
or
a
church
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
you
were
laughing
at
just
now
?
''
Newman
asked
;
``
the
size
of
*NL*
my
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
size
only
,
''
replied
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
but
splendor
,
and
*NL*
harmony
,
and
beauty
of
detail
.
It
was
the
smile
of
admiration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
So
it
IS
very
ugly
?
''
he
*NL*
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugly
,
my
dear
sir
?
It
is
magnificent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
same
thing
,
I
suppose
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Make
yourself
*NL*
comfortable
.
Your
coming
to
see
me
,
I
take
it
,
is
an
act
of
friendship
.
*NL*
You
were
not
obliged
to
.
Therefore
,
if
anything
around
here
amuses
you
,
*NL*
it
will
be
all
in
a
pleasant
way
.
Laugh
as
loud
as
you
please
;
I
like
*NL*
to
see
my
visitors
cheerful
.
Only
,
I
must
make
this
request
:
that
you
*NL*
explain
the
joke
to
me
as
soon
as
you
can
speak
.
I
do
n't
want
to
lose
*NL*
anything
,
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
stared
,
with
a
look
of
unresentful
perplexity
.
He
laid
*NL*
his
hand
on
Newman
's
sleeve
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
,
*NL*
but
he
suddenly
checked
himself
,
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
puffed
*NL*
at
his
cigar
.
At
last
,
however
,
breaking
silence
,
--
``
Certainly
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
my
coming
to
see
you
is
an
act
of
friendship
.
Nevertheless
I
was
in
a
*NL*
measure
obliged
to
do
so
.
My
sister
asked
me
to
come
,
and
a
request
from
*NL*
my
sister
is
,
for
me
,
a
law
.
I
was
near
you
,
and
I
observed
lights
*NL*
in
what
I
supposed
were
your
rooms
.
It
was
not
a
ceremonious
hour
for
*NL*
making
a
call
,
but
I
was
not
sorry
to
do
something
that
would
show
I
was
*NL*
not
performing
a
mere
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
I
am
as
large
as
life
,
''
said
Newman
,
extending
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
''
the
young
man
went
on
``
by
giving
me
*NL*
unlimited
leave
to
laugh
.
Certainly
I
am
a
great
laugher
,
and
it
is
*NL*
better
to
laugh
too
much
than
too
little
.
But
it
is
not
in
order
that
we
*NL*
may
laugh
together
--
or
separately
--
that
I
have
,
I
may
say
,
sought
your
*NL*
acquaintance
.
To
speak
with
almost
impudent
frankness
,
you
interest
me
!
''
*NL*
All
this
was
uttered
by
M.
de
Bellegarde
with
the
modulated
smoothness
*NL*
of
the
man
of
the
world
,
and
in
spite
of
his
excellent
English
,
of
*NL*
the
Frenchman
;
but
Newman
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
sat
noting
its
*NL*
harmonious
flow
,
perceived
that
it
was
not
mere
mechanical
urbanity
.
*NL*
Decidedly
,
there
was
something
in
his
visitor
that
he
liked
.
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
was
a
foreigner
to
his
finger-tips
,
and
if
Newman
had
met
him
*NL*
on
a
Western
prairie
he
would
have
felt
it
proper
to
address
him
with
a
*NL*
``
How-d'ye-do
,
Mosseer
?
''
But
there
was
something
in
his
physiognomy
which
*NL*
seemed
to
cast
a
sort
of
aerial
bridge
over
the
impassable
gulf
produced
*NL*
by
difference
of
race
.
He
was
below
the
middle
height
,
and
robust
and
*NL*
agile
in
figure
.
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
,
Newman
afterwards
learned
,
had
*NL*
a
mortal
dread
of
the
robustness
overtaking
the
agility
;
he
was
afraid
*NL*
of
growing
stout
;
he
was
too
short
,
as
he
said
,
to
afford
a
belly
.
He
*NL*
rode
and
fenced
and
practiced
gymnastics
with
unremitting
zeal
,
and
if
*NL*
you
greeted
him
with
a
``
How
well
you
are
looking
''
he
started
and
turned
*NL*
pale
.
In
your
WELL
he
read
a
grosser
monosyllable
.
He
had
a
round
head
,
*NL*
high
above
the
ears
,
a
crop
of
hair
at
once
dense
and
silky
,
a
broad
,
*NL*
low
forehead
,
a
short
nose
,
of
the
ironical
and
inquiring
rather
than
of
*NL*
the
dogmatic
or
sensitive
cast
,
and
a
mustache
as
delicate
as
that
of
*NL*
a
page
in
a
romance
.
He
resembled
his
sister
not
in
feature
,
but
in
the
*NL*
expression
of
his
clear
,
bright
eye
,
completely
void
of
introspection
,
*NL*
and
in
the
way
he
smiled
.
The
great
point
in
his
face
was
that
it
was
*NL*
intensely
alive
--
frankly
,
ardently
,
gallantly
alive
.
The
look
of
it
*NL*
was
like
a
bell
,
of
which
the
handle
might
have
been
in
the
young
man
's
*NL*
soul
:
at
a
touch
of
the
handle
it
rang
with
a
loud
,
silver
sound
.
There
*NL*
was
something
in
his
quick
,
light
brown
eye
which
assured
you
that
he
*NL*
was
not
economizing
his
consciousness
.
He
was
not
living
in
a
corner
of
*NL*
it
to
spare
the
furniture
of
the
rest
.
He
was
squarely
encamped
in
the
*NL*
centre
and
he
was
keeping
open
house
.
When
he
smiled
,
it
was
like
the
*NL*
movement
of
a
person
who
in
emptying
a
cup
turns
it
upside
down
:
he
gave
*NL*
you
the
last
drop
of
his
jollity
.
He
inspired
Newman
with
something
of
*NL*
the
same
kindness
that
our
hero
used
to
feel
in
his
earlier
years
*NL*
for
those
of
his
companions
who
could
perform
strange
and
clever
*NL*
tricks
--
make
their
joints
crack
in
queer
places
or
whistle
at
the
back
*NL*
of
their
mouths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
told
me
,
''
M.
de
Bellegarde
continued
,
``
that
I
ought
to
come
*NL*
and
remove
the
impression
that
I
had
taken
such
great
pains
to
produce
*NL*
upon
you
;
the
impression
that
I
am
a
lunatic
.
Did
it
strike
you
that
I
*NL*
behaved
very
oddly
the
other
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
so
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
my
sister
tells
me
.
''
And
M.
de
Bellegarde
watched
his
host
for
a
*NL*
moment
through
his
smoke-wreaths
.
``
If
that
is
the
case
,
I
think
we
had
*NL*
better
let
it
stand
.
I
did
n't
try
to
make
you
think
I
was
a
lunatic
,
at
*NL*
all
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
wanted
to
produce
a
favorable
impression
.
*NL*
But
if
,
after
all
,
I
made
a
fool
of
myself
,
it
was
the
intention
of
*NL*
Providence
.
I
should
injure
myself
by
protesting
too
much
,
for
I
*NL*
should
seem
to
set
up
a
claim
for
wisdom
which
,
in
the
sequel
of
our
*NL*
acquaintance
,
I
could
by
no
means
justify
.
Set
me
down
as
a
lunatic
with
*NL*
intervals
of
sanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
guess
you
know
what
you
are
about
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
sane
,
I
am
very
sane
;
that
I
admit
,
''
M.
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
answered
.
``
But
I
did
n't
come
here
to
talk
about
myself
.
I
should
like
to
*NL*
ask
you
a
few
questions
.
You
allow
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
specimen
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
live
here
all
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Absolutely
.
With
whom
should
I
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
moment
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
with
a
smile
``
I
am
asking
*NL*
questions
,
not
answering
them
.
You
have
come
to
Paris
for
your
*NL*
pleasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
while
.
Then
,
at
last
,
``
Every
one
asks
me
that
!
''
he
*NL*
said
with
his
mild
slowness
.
``
It
sounds
so
awfully
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
at
any
rate
you
had
a
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
came
for
my
pleasure
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
Though
it
is
foolish
,
it
is
*NL*
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
enjoying
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
any
other
good
American
,
Newman
thought
it
as
well
not
to
truckle
*NL*
to
the
foreigner
.
``
Oh
,
so-so
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
puffed
his
cigar
again
in
silence
.
``
For
myself
,
''
he
*NL*
said
at
last
,
``
I
am
entirely
at
your
service
.
Anything
I
can
do
for
you
*NL*
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
do
.
Call
upon
me
at
your
convenience
.
Is
there
*NL*
any
one
you
desire
to
know
--
anything
you
wish
to
see
?
It
is
a
pity
you
*NL*
should
not
enjoy
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
enjoy
it
!
''
said
Newman
,
good-naturedly
.
``
I
'm
much
obligated
to
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honestly
speaking
,
''
M.
de
Bellegarde
went
on
,
``
there
is
something
*NL*
absurd
to
me
in
hearing
myself
make
you
these
offers
.
They
represent
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
goodwill
,
but
they
represent
little
else
.
You
are
a
*NL*
successful
man
and
I
am
a
failure
,
and
it
's
a
turning
of
the
tables
to
*NL*
talk
as
if
I
could
lend
you
a
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
are
you
a
failure
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
a
tragical
failure
!
''
cried
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
``
I
have
fallen
from
a
height
,
and
my
fiasco
has
made
no
noise
.
You
,
*NL*
evidently
,
are
a
success
.
You
have
made
a
fortune
,
you
have
built
up
an
*NL*
edifice
,
you
are
a
financial
,
commercial
power
,
you
can
travel
about
*NL*
the
world
until
you
have
found
a
soft
spot
,
and
lie
down
in
it
with
*NL*
the
consciousness
of
having
earned
your
rest
.
Is
not
that
true
?
Well
,
*NL*
imagine
the
exact
reverse
of
all
that
,
and
you
have
me
.
I
have
done
*NL*
nothing
--
I
can
do
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
story
.
Some
day
I
will
tell
you

Meanwhile
,
I
'm
right
,
eh
?
*NL*
You
are
a
success
?
You
have
made
a
fortune
?
It
's
none
of
my
business
,
*NL*
but
,
in
short
,
you
are
rich
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
another
thing
that
it
sounds
foolish
to
say
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Hang
*NL*
it
,
no
man
is
rich
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
philosophers
affirm
,
''
laughed
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
that
*NL*
no
man
was
poor
;
but
your
formula
strikes
me
as
an
improvement
.
As
a
*NL*
general
thing
,
I
confess
,
I
do
n't
like
successful
people
,
and
I
find
*NL*
clever
men
who
have
made
great
fortunes
very
offensive
.
They
tread
on
*NL*
my
toes
;
they
make
me
uncomfortable
.
But
as
soon
as
I
saw
you
,
I
said
*NL*
to
myself
.
`
Ah
,
there
is
a
man
with
whom
I
shall
get
on
.
He
has
*NL*
the
good-nature
of
success
and
none
of
the
morgue
;
he
has
not
our
*NL*
confoundedly
irritable
French
vanity
.
'
In
short
,
I
took
a
fancy
to
you
.
*NL*
We
are
very
different
,
I
'm
sure
;
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
a
subject
on
*NL*
which
we
think
or
feel
alike
.
But
I
rather
think
we
shall
get
on
,
for
*NL*
there
is
such
a
thing
,
you
know
,
as
being
too
different
to
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
never
quarrel
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
Sometimes
it
's
a
duty
--
or
at
least
it
's
a
pleasure
.
Oh
,
I
have
*NL*
had
two
or
three
delicious
quarrels
in
my
day
!
''
and
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
handsome
smile
assumed
,
at
the
memory
of
these
incidents
,
an
almost
*NL*
voluptuous
intensity
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
preamble
embodied
in
his
share
of
the
foregoing
fragment
of
*NL*
dialogue
,
he
paid
our
hero
a
long
visit
;
as
the
two
men
sat
with
their
*NL*
heels
on
Newman
's
glowing
hearth
,
they
heard
the
small
hours
of
the
*NL*
morning
striking
larger
from
a
far-off
belfry
.
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
was
,
by
his
own
confession
,
at
all
times
a
great
chatterer
,
and
on
this
*NL*
occasion
he
was
evidently
in
a
particularly
loquacious
mood
.
It
was
a
*NL*
tradition
of
his
race
that
people
of
its
blood
always
conferred
a
favor
*NL*
by
their
smiles
,
and
as
his
enthusiasms
were
as
rare
as
his
civility
was
*NL*
constant
,
he
had
a
double
reason
for
not
suspecting
that
his
friendship
*NL*
could
ever
be
importunate
.
Moreover
,
the
flower
of
an
ancient
stem
as
*NL*
he
was
,
tradition
-LRB-
since
I
have
used
the
word
-RRB-
had
in
his
temperament
*NL*
nothing
of
disagreeable
rigidity
.
It
was
muffled
in
sociability
and
*NL*
urbanity
,
as
an
old
dowager
in
her
laces
and
strings
of
pearls
.
Valentin
*NL*
was
what
is
called
in
France
a
gentilhomme
,
of
the
purest
source
,
and
*NL*
his
rule
of
life
,
so
far
as
it
was
definite
,
was
to
play
the
part
of
a
*NL*
gentilhomme
.
This
,
it
seemed
to
him
,
was
enough
to
occupy
comfortably
a
*NL*
young
man
of
ordinary
good
parts
.
But
all
that
he
was
he
was
by
instinct
*NL*
and
not
by
theory
,
and
the
amiability
of
his
character
was
so
great
that
*NL*
certain
of
the
aristocratic
virtues
,
which
in
some
aspects
seem
rather
*NL*
brittle
and
trenchant
,
acquired
in
his
application
of
them
an
extreme
*NL*
geniality
.
In
his
younger
years
he
had
been
suspected
of
low
tastes
,
*NL*
and
his
mother
had
greatly
feared
he
would
make
a
slip
in
the
mud
of
the
*NL*
highway
and
bespatter
the
family
shield
.
He
had
been
treated
,
therefore
,
*NL*
to
more
than
his
share
of
schooling
and
drilling
,
but
his
instructors
*NL*
had
not
succeeded
in
mounting
him
upon
stilts
.
They
could
not
spoil
his
*NL*
safe
spontaneity
,
and
he
remained
the
least
cautious
and
the
most
lucky
*NL*
of
young
nobles
.
He
had
been
tied
with
so
short
a
rope
in
his
youth
that
*NL*
he
had
now
a
mortal
grudge
against
family
discipline
.
He
had
been
known
*NL*
to
say
,
within
the
limits
of
the
family
,
that
,
light-headed
as
he
was
,
*NL*
the
honor
of
the
name
was
safer
in
his
hands
than
in
those
of
some
of
*NL*
it
's
other
members
,
and
that
if
a
day
ever
came
to
try
it
,
they
should
*NL*
see
.
His
talk
was
an
odd
mixture
of
almost
boyish
garrulity
and
of
the
*NL*
reserve
and
discretion
of
the
man
of
the
world
,
and
he
seemed
to
Newman
,
*NL*
as
afterwards
young
members
of
the
Latin
races
often
seemed
to
him
,
*NL*
now
amusingly
juvenile
and
now
appallingly
mature
.
In
America
,
Newman
*NL*
reflected
,
lads
of
twenty-five
and
thirty
have
old
heads
and
young
*NL*
hearts
,
or
at
least
young
morals
;
here
they
have
young
heads
and
very
*NL*
aged
hearts
,
morals
the
most
grizzled
and
wrinkled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
envy
you
is
your
liberty
,
''
observed
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
your
wide
*NL*
range
,
your
freedom
to
come
and
go
,
your
not
having
a
lot
of
people
,
who
*NL*
take
themselves
awfully
seriously
,
expecting
something
of
you
.
I
live
,
''
*NL*
he
added
with
a
sigh
,
``
beneath
the
eyes
of
my
admirable
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
your
own
fault
;
what
is
to
hinder
your
ranging

''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
delightful
simplicity
in
that
remark
!
Everything
is
to

what
you
were
born
,
and
being
born
poor
--
do
*NL*
I
understand
it
?
--
it
was
therefore
inevitable
that
you
should
become
*NL*
rich
.
You
were
in
a
position
that
makes
one
's
mouth
water
;
you
looked
*NL*
round
you
and
saw
a
world
full
of
things
you
had
only
to
step
up
to
and
*NL*
take
hold
of
.
When
I
was
twenty
,
I
looked
around
me
and
saw
a
world
with
*NL*
everything
ticketed
`
Hands
off
!
'
and
the
deuce
of
it
was
that
the
ticket
*NL*
seemed
meant
only
for
me
.
I
could
n't
go
into
business
,
I
could
n't
make
*NL*
money
,
because
I
was
a
Bellegarde
.
I
could
n't
go
into
politics
,
because
*NL*
I
was
a
Bellegarde
--
the
Bellegardes
do
n't
recognize
the
Bonapartes
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
go
into
literature
,
because
I
was
a
dunce
.
I
could
n't
marry
a
*NL*
rich
girl
,
because
no
Bellegarde
had
ever
married
a
roturiere
,
and
it
*NL*
was
not
proper
that
I
should
begin
.
We
shall
have
to
come
to
it
,
yet
.
*NL*
Marriageable
heiresses
,
de
notre
bord
,
are
not
to
be
had
for
nothing
;
it
*NL*
must
be
name
for
name
,
and
fortune
for
fortune
.
The
only
thing
I
could
*NL*
do
was
to
go
and
fight
for
the
Pope
.
That
I
did
,
punctiliously
,
and
*NL*
received
an
apostolic
flesh-wound
at
Castlefidardo
.
It
did
neither
the
*NL*
Holy
Father
nor
me
any
good
,
that
I
could
see
.
Rome
was
doubtless
a
*NL*
very
amusing
place
in
the
days
of
Caligula
,
but
it
has
sadly
fallen
off
*NL*
since
.
I
passed
three
years
in
the
Castle
of
St.
Angelo
,
and
then
came
*NL*
back
to
secular
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
no
profession
--
you
do
nothing
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
nothing
!
I
am
supposed
to
amuse
myself
,
and
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
*NL*
have
amused
myself
.
One
can
,
if
one
knows
how
.
But
you
ca
n't
keep
it
up
*NL*
forever
.
I
am
good
for
another
five
years
,
perhaps
,
but
I
foresee
that
*NL*
after
that
I
shall
lose
my
appetite
.
Then
what
shall
I
do
?
I
think
I
*NL*
shall
turn
monk
.
Seriously
,
I
think
I
shall
tie
a
rope
round
my
waist
*NL*
and
go
into
a
monastery
.
It
was
an
old
custom
,
and
the
old
customs
were
*NL*
very
good
.
People
understood
life
quite
as
well
as
we
do
.
They
kept
*NL*
the
pot
boiling
till
it
cracked
,
and
then
they
put
it
on
the
shelf
*NL*
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
religious
?
''
asked
Newman
,
in
a
tone
which
gave
the
inquiry
*NL*
a
grotesque
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
evidently
appreciated
the
comical
element
in
the
*NL*
question
,
but
he
looked
at
Newman
a
moment
with
extreme
soberness
.
``
I
am
*NL*
a
very
good
Catholic
.
I
respect
the
Church
.
I
adore
the
blessed
Virgin
.
*NL*
I
fear
the
Devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
you
are
very
well
fixed
.
You
have
got
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
present
and
religion
in
the
future
;
what
do
you
complain
*NL*
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
part
of
one
's
pleasure
to
complain
.
There
is
something
in
your
*NL*
own
circumstances
that
irritates
me
.
You
are
the
first
man
I
have
ever
*NL*
envied
.
It
's
singular
,
but
so
it
is
.
I
have
known
many
men
who
,
besides
*NL*
any
factitious
advantages
that
I
may
possess
,
had
money
and
brains
into
*NL*
the
bargain
;
but
somehow
they
have
never
disturbed
my
good-humor
.
But
*NL*
you
have
got
something
that
I
should
have
liked
to
have
.
It
is
not
*NL*
money
,
it
is
not
even
brains
--
though
no
doubt
yours
are
excellent
.
It
is
*NL*
not
your
six
feet
of
height
,
though
I
should
have
rather
liked
to
be
a
*NL*
couple
of
inches
taller
.
It
's
a
sort
of
air
you
have
of
being
thoroughly
*NL*
at
home
in
the
world
.
When
I
was
a
boy
,
my
father
told
me
that
it
was
*NL*
by
such
an
air
as
that
that
people
recognized
a
Bellegarde
.
He
called
my
*NL*
attention
to
it
.
He
did
n't
advise
me
to
cultivate
it
;
he
said
that
as
we
*NL*
grew
up
it
always
came
of
itself
.
I
supposed
it
had
come
to
me
,
because
*NL*
I
think
I
have
always
had
the
feeling
.
My
place
in
life
was
made
for
me
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
easy
to
occupy
it
.
But
you
who
,
as
I
understand
it
,
*NL*
have
made
your
own
place
,
you
who
,
as
you
told
us
the
other
day
,
have
*NL*
manufactured
wash-tubs
--
you
strike
me
,
somehow
,
as
a
man
who
stands
at
*NL*
his
ease
,
who
looks
at
things
from
a
height
.
I
fancy
you
going
about
the
*NL*
world
like
a
man
traveling
on
a
railroad
in
which
he
owns
a
large
amount
*NL*
of
stock
.
You
make
me
feel
as
if
I
had
missed
something
.
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
proud
consciousness
of
honest
toil
--
of
having
manufactured
a
*NL*
few
wash-tubs
,
''
said
Newman
,
at
once
jocose
and
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
have
seen
men
who
had
done
even
more
,
men
who
had
made
not
*NL*
only
wash-tubs
,
but
soap
--
strong-smelling
yellow
soap
,
in
great
bars
;
*NL*
and
they
never
made
me
the
least
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
the
privilege
of
being
an
American
citizen
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
That
sets
a
man
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
''
rejoined
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
``
But
I
am
forced
to
say
that
I
*NL*
have
seen
a
great
many
American
citizens
who
did
n't
seem
at
all
set
up
*NL*
or
in
the
least
like
large
stock-holders
.
I
never
envied
them
.
I
rather
*NL*
think
the
thing
is
an
accomplishment
of
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
you
will
make
me
proud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
shall
not
.
You
have
nothing
to
do
with
pride
,
or
with
*NL*
humility
--
that
is
a
part
of
this
easy
manner
of
yours
.
People
are
*NL*
proud
only
when
they
have
something
to
lose
,
and
humble
when
they
have
*NL*
something
to
gain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
have
to
lose
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
but
I
certainly
have
*NL*
something
to
gain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
his
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
hesitated
a
while
.
``
I
will
tell
you
when
I
know
you
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
that
will
be
soon
!
Then
,
if
I
can
help
you
to
gain
it
,
I
shall
*NL*
be
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
may
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
forget
,
then
,
that
I
am
your
servant
,
''
M.
de
Bellegarde
answered
;
*NL*
and
shortly
afterwards
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
next
three
weeks
Newman
saw
Bellegarde
several
times
,
and
*NL*
without
formally
swearing
an
eternal
friendship
the
two
men
established
*NL*
a
sort
of
comradeship
.
To
Newman
,
Bellegarde
was
the
ideal
Frenchman
,
*NL*
the
Frenchman
of
tradition
and
romance
,
so
far
as
our
hero
was
concerned
*NL*
with
these
mystical
influences
.
Gallant
,
expansive
,
amusing
,
more
*NL*
pleased
himself
with
the
effect
he
produced
than
those
-LRB-
even
when
*NL*
they
were
well
pleased
-RRB-
for
whom
he
produced
it
;
a
master
of
all
the
*NL*
distinctively
social
virtues
and
a
votary
of
all
agreeable
sensations
;
*NL*
a
devotee
of
something
mysterious
and
sacred
to
which
he
occasionally
*NL*
alluded
in
terms
more
ecstatic
even
than
those
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
*NL*
last
pretty
woman
,
and
which
was
simply
the
beautiful
though
somewhat
*NL*
superannuated
image
of
HONOR
;
he
was
irresistibly
entertaining
and
*NL*
enlivening
,
and
he
formed
a
character
to
which
Newman
was
as
capable
of
*NL*
doing
justice
when
he
had
once
been
placed
in
contact
with
it
,
as
he
was
*NL*
unlikely
,
in
musing
upon
the
possible
mixtures
of
our
human
ingredients
,
*NL*
mentally
to
have
foreshadowed
it
.
Bellegarde
did
not
in
the
least
cause
*NL*
him
to
modify
his
needful
premise
that
all
Frenchmen
are
of
a
frothy
and
*NL*
imponderable
substance
;
he
simply
reminded
him
that
light
materials
may
*NL*
be
beaten
up
into
a
most
agreeable
compound
.
No
two
companions
could
*NL*
be
more
different
,
but
their
differences
made
a
capital
basis
for
a
*NL*
friendship
of
which
the
distinctive
characteristic
was
that
it
was
*NL*
extremely
amusing
to
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
lived
in
the
basement
of
an
old
house
in
the
Rue
*NL*
d'Anjou
St.
Honore
,
and
his
small
apartments
lay
between
the
court
of
*NL*
the
house
and
an
old
garden
which
spread
itself
behind
it
--
one
of
those
*NL*
large
,
sunless
humid
gardens
into
which
you
look
unexpectingly
in
Paris
*NL*
from
back
windows
,
wondering
how
among
the
grudging
habitations
they
*NL*
find
their
space
.
When
Newman
returned
Bellegarde
's
visit
,
he
hinted
*NL*
that
HIS
lodging
was
at
least
as
much
a
laughing
matter
as
his
own
.
But
*NL*
its
oddities
were
of
a
different
cast
from
those
of
our
hero
's
*NL*
gilded
saloons
on
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
:
the
place
was
low
,
dusky
,
*NL*
contracted
,
and
crowded
with
curious
bric-a-brac
.
Bellegarde
,
penniless
*NL*
patrician
as
he
was
,
was
an
insatiable
collector
,
and
his
walls
were
*NL*
covered
with
rusty
arms
and
ancient
panels
and
platters
,
his
doorways
*NL*
draped
in
faded
tapestries
,
his
floors
muffled
in
the
skins
of
beasts
.
*NL*
Here
and
there
was
one
of
those
uncomfortable
tributes
to
elegance
in
*NL*
which
the
upholsterer
's
art
,
in
France
,
is
so
prolific
;
a
curtain
recess
*NL*
with
a
sheet
of
looking-glass
in
which
,
among
the
shadows
,
you
could
see
*NL*
nothing
;
a
divan
on
which
,
for
its
festoons
and
furbelows
,
you
could
not
*NL*
sit
;
a
fireplace
draped
,
flounced
,
and
frilled
to
the
complete
exclusion
*NL*
of
fire
.
The
young
man
's
possessions
were
in
picturesque
disorder
,
and
*NL*
his
apartment
was
pervaded
by
the
odor
of
cigars
,
mingled
with
perfumes
*NL*
more
inscrutable
.
Newman
thought
it
a
damp
,
gloomy
place
to
live
in
,
*NL*
and
was
puzzled
by
the
obstructive
and
fragmentary
character
of
the
*NL*
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
according
to
the
custom
of
his
country
talked
very
*NL*
generously
about
himself
,
and
unveiled
the
mysteries
of
his
private
*NL*
history
with
an
unsparing
hand
.
Inevitably
,
he
had
a
vast
deal
to
*NL*
say
about
women
,
and
he
used
frequently
to
indulge
in
sentimental
and
*NL*
ironical
apostrophes
to
these
authors
of
his
joys
and
woes
.
``
Oh
,
the
*NL*
women
,
the
women
,
and
the
things
they
have
made
me
do
!
''
he
would
exclaim
*NL*
with
a
lustrous
eye
.
``
C'est
egal
,
of
all
the
follies
and
stupidities
I
*NL*
have
committed
for
them
I
would
not
have
missed
one
!
''
On
this
subject
*NL*
Newman
maintained
an
habitual
reserve
;
to
expatiate
largely
upon
it
had
*NL*
always
seemed
to
him
a
proceeding
vaguely
analogous
to
the
cooing
of
*NL*
pigeons
and
the
chattering
of
monkeys
,
and
even
inconsistent
with
a
*NL*
fully
developed
human
character
.
But
Bellegarde
's
confidences
greatly
*NL*
amused
him
,
and
rarely
displeased
him
,
for
the
generous
young
Frenchman
*NL*
was
not
a
cynic
.
``
I
really
think
,
''
he
had
once
said
,
``
that
I
am
not
more
*NL*
depraved
than
most
of
my
contemporaries
.
They
are
tolerably
depraved
,
*NL*
my
contemporaries
!
''
He
said
wonderfully
pretty
things
about
his
female
*NL*
friends
,
and
,
numerous
and
various
as
they
had
been
,
declared
that
on
*NL*
the
whole
there
was
more
good
in
them
than
harm
.
``
But
you
are
not
*NL*
to
take
that
as
advice
,
''
he
added
.
``
As
an
authority
I
am
very
*NL*
untrustworthy
.
I
'm
prejudiced
in
their
favor
;
I
'm
an
IDEALIST
!
''
Newman
*NL*
listened
to
him
with
his
impartial
smile
,
and
was
glad
,
for
his
own
*NL*
sake
,
that
he
had
fine
feelings
;
but
he
mentally
repudiated
the
idea
*NL*
of
a
Frenchman
having
discovered
any
merit
in
the
amiable
sex
which
he
*NL*
himself
did
not
suspect
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
however
,
did
not
confine
his
*NL*
conversation
to
the
autobiographical
channel
;
he
questioned
our
hero
*NL*
largely
as
to
the
events
of
his
own
life
,
and
Newman
told
him
some
*NL*
better
stories
than
any
that
Bellegarde
carried
in
his
budget
.
He
*NL*
narrated
his
career
,
in
fact
,
from
the
beginning
,
through
all
its
*NL*
variations
,
and
whenever
his
companion
's
credulity
,
or
his
habits
of
*NL*
gentility
,
appeared
to
protest
,
it
amused
him
to
heighten
the
color
*NL*
of
the
episode
.
Newman
had
sat
with
Western
humorists
in
knots
,
round
*NL*
cast-iron
stoves
,
and
seen
``
tall
''
stories
grow
taller
without
toppling
*NL*
over
,
and
his
own
imagination
had
learned
the
trick
of
piling
up
*NL*
consistent
wonders
.
Bellegarde
's
regular
attitude
at
last
became
that
*NL*
of
laughing
self-defense
;
to
maintain
his
reputation
as
an
all-knowing
*NL*
Frenchman
,
he
doubted
of
everything
,
wholesale
.
The
result
of
this
was
*NL*
that
Newman
found
it
impossible
to
convince
him
of
certain
time-honored
*NL*
verities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
details
do
n't
matter
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
``
You
have
*NL*
evidently
had
some
surprising
adventures
;
you
have
seen
some
strange
*NL*
sides
of
life
,
you
have
revolved
to
and
fro
over
a
whole
continent
as
*NL*
I
walked
up
and
down
the
Boulevard
.
You
are
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
*NL*
vengeance
!
You
have
spent
some
deadly
dull
hours
,
and
you
have
done
some
*NL*
extremely
disagreeable
things
:
you
have
shoveled
sand
,
as
a
boy
,
for
*NL*
supper
,
and
you
have
eaten
roast
dog
in
a
gold-diggers
'
camp
.
You
have
*NL*
stood
casting
up
figures
for
ten
hours
at
a
time
,
and
you
have
sat
*NL*
through
Methodist
sermons
for
the
sake
of
looking
at
a
pretty
girl
in
*NL*
another
pew
.
All
that
is
rather
stiff
,
as
we
say
.
But
at
any
rate
you
*NL*
have
done
something
and
you
are
something
;
you
have
used
your
will
*NL*
and
you
have
made
your
fortune
.
You
have
not
stupified
yourself
*NL*
with
debauchery
and
you
have
not
mortgaged
your
fortune
to
social
*NL*
conveniences
.
You
take
things
easily
,
and
you
have
fewer
prejudices
even
*NL*
than
I
,
who
pretend
to
have
none
,
but
who
in
reality
have
three
or
*NL*
four
.
Happy
man
,
you
are
strong
and
you
are
free
.
But
what
the
deuce
,
''
*NL*
demanded
the
young
man
in
conclusion
,
``
do
you
propose
to
do
with
such
*NL*
advantages
?
Really
to
use
them
you
need
a
better
world
than
this
.
There
*NL*
is
nothing
worth
your
while
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
there
is
something
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
murmured
Newman
,
``
I
will
tell
you
some
other
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
our
hero
delayed
from
day
to
day
broaching
a
subject
*NL*
which
he
had
very
much
at
heart
.
Meanwhile
,
however
,
he
was
growing
*NL*
practically
familiar
with
it
;
in
other
words
,
he
had
called
again
,
three
*NL*
times
,
on
Madame
de
Cintre
.
On
only
two
of
these
occasions
had
he
found
*NL*
her
at
home
,
and
on
each
of
them
she
had
other
visitors
.
Her
visitors
*NL*
were
numerous
and
extremely
loquacious
,
and
they
exacted
much
of
their
*NL*
hostess
's
attention
.
She
found
time
,
however
,
to
bestow
a
little
of
it
*NL*
on
Newman
,
in
an
occasional
vague
smile
,
the
very
vagueness
of
which
*NL*
pleased
him
,
allowing
him
as
it
did
to
fill
it
out
mentally
,
both
at
the
*NL*
time
and
afterwards
,
with
such
meanings
as
most
pleased
him
.
He
sat
by
*NL*
without
speaking
,
looking
at
the
entrances
and
exits
,
the
greetings
and
*NL*
chatterings
,
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
visitors
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
at
*NL*
the
play
,
and
as
if
his
own
speaking
would
be
an
interruption
;
sometimes
*NL*
he
wished
he
had
a
book
,
to
follow
the
dialogue
;
he
half
expected
to
see
*NL*
a
woman
in
a
white
cap
and
pink
ribbons
come
and
offer
him
one
for
two
*NL*
francs
.
Some
of
the
ladies
looked
at
him
very
hard
--
or
very
soft
,
as
you
*NL*
please
;
others
seemed
profoundly
unconscious
of
his
presence
.
The
men
*NL*
looked
only
at
Madame
de
Cintre
.
This
was
inevitable
;
for
whether
one
*NL*
called
her
beautiful
or
not
she
entirely
occupied
and
filled
one
's
*NL*
vision
,
just
as
an
agreeable
sound
fills
one
's
ear
.
Newman
had
but
*NL*
twenty
distinct
words
with
her
,
but
he
carried
away
an
impression
to
*NL*
which
solemn
promises
could
not
have
given
a
higher
value
.
She
was
part
*NL*
of
the
play
that
he
was
seeing
acted
,
quite
as
much
as
her
companions
;
*NL*
but
how
she
filled
the
stage
and
how
much
better
she
did
it
!
Whether
she
*NL*
rose
or
seated
herself
;
whether
she
went
with
her
departing
friends
to
*NL*
the
door
and
lifted
up
the
heavy
curtain
as
they
passed
out
,
and
stood
*NL*
an
instant
looking
after
them
and
giving
them
the
last
nod
;
or
whether
*NL*
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
her
arms
crossed
and
her
eyes
resting
,
*NL*
listening
and
smiling
;
she
gave
Newman
the
feeling
that
he
should
like
*NL*
to
have
her
always
before
him
,
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
along
the
whole
*NL*
scale
of
expressive
hospitality
.
If
it
might
be
TO
him
,
it
would
be
*NL*
well
;
if
it
might
be
FOR
him
,
it
would
be
still
better
!
She
was
so
tall
*NL*
and
yet
so
light
,
so
active
and
yet
so
still
,
so
elegant
and
yet
so
*NL*
simple
,
so
frank
and
yet
so
mysterious
!
It
was
the
mystery
--
it
was
what
*NL*
she
was
off
the
stage
,
as
it
were
--
that
interested
Newman
most
of
*NL*
all
.
He
could
not
have
told
you
what
warrant
he
had
for
talking
about
*NL*
mysteries
;
if
it
had
been
his
habit
to
express
himself
in
poetic
figures
*NL*
he
might
have
said
that
in
observing
Madame
de
Cintre
he
seemed
to
see
*NL*
the
vague
circle
which
sometimes
accompanies
the
partly-filled
disk
of
*NL*
the
moon
.
It
was
not
that
she
was
reserved
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
was
*NL*
as
frank
as
flowing
water
.
But
he
was
sure
she
had
qualities
which
she
*NL*
herself
did
not
suspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
abstained
for
several
reasons
from
saying
some
of
these
things
*NL*
to
Bellegarde
.
One
reason
was
that
before
proceeding
to
any
act
he
was
*NL*
always
circumspect
,
conjectural
,
contemplative
;
he
had
little
eagerness
,
*NL*
as
became
a
man
who
felt
that
whenever
he
really
began
to
move
he
*NL*
walked
with
long
steps
.
And
then
,
it
simply
pleased
him
not
to
speak
--
it
*NL*
occupied
him
,
it
excited
him
.
But
one
day
Bellegarde
had
been
dining
*NL*
with
him
,
at
a
restaurant
,
and
they
had
sat
long
over
their
dinner
.
On
*NL*
rising
from
it
,
Bellegarde
proposed
that
,
to
help
them
through
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
evening
,
they
should
go
and
see
Madame
Dandelard
.
Madame
*NL*
Dandelard
was
a
little
Italian
lady
who
had
married
a
Frenchman
who
*NL*
proved
to
be
a
rake
and
a
brute
and
the
torment
of
her
life
.
Her
husband
*NL*
had
spent
all
her
money
,
and
then
,
lacking
the
means
of
obtaining
more
*NL*
expensive
pleasures
,
had
taken
,
in
his
duller
hours
,
to
beating
her
.
*NL*
She
had
a
blue
spot
somewhere
,
which
she
showed
to
several
persons
,
*NL*
including
Bellegarde
.
She
had
obtained
a
separation
from
her
husband
,
*NL*
collected
the
scraps
of
her
fortune
-LRB-
they
were
very
meagre
-RRB-
and
come
to
*NL*
live
in
Paris
,
where
she
was
staying
at
a
hotel
garni
.
She
was
always
*NL*
looking
for
an
apartment
,
and
visiting
,
inquiringly
,
those
of
other
*NL*
people
.
She
was
very
pretty
,
very
childlike
,
and
she
made
very
*NL*
extraordinary
remarks
.
Bellegarde
had
made
her
acquaintance
,
and
the
*NL*
source
of
his
interest
in
her
was
,
according
to
his
own
declaration
,
a
*NL*
curiosity
as
to
what
would
become
of
her
.
``
She
is
poor
,
she
is
pretty
,
*NL*
and
she
is
silly
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
seems
to
me
she
can
go
only
one
way
.
*NL*
It
's
a
pity
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
I
will
give
her
six
months
.
She
has
*NL*
nothing
to
fear
from
me
,
but
I
am
watching
the
process
.
I
am
curious
to
*NL*
see
just
how
things
will
go
.
Yes
,
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
:
this
*NL*
horrible
Paris
hardens
one
's
heart
.
But
it
quickens
one
's
wits
,
and
it
*NL*
ends
by
teaching
one
a
refinement
of
observation
!
To
see
this
little
*NL*
woman
's
little
drama
play
itself
out
,
now
,
is
,
for
me
,
an
intellectual
*NL*
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
is
going
to
throw
herself
away
,
''
Newman
had
said
,
``
you
ought
to
*NL*
stop
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
her
?
How
stop
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
to
her
;
give
her
some
good
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
laughed
.
``
Heaven
deliver
us
both
!
Imagine
the
situation
!
Go
*NL*
and
advise
her
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
this
that
Newman
had
gone
with
Bellegarde
to
see
Madame
*NL*
Dandelard
.
When
they
came
away
,
Bellegarde
reproached
his
companion
.
*NL*
``
Where
was
your
famous
advice
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
did
n't
hear
a
word
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
give
it
up
,
''
said
Newman
,
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
as
bad
as
I
!
''
said
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
because
I
do
n't
take
an
`
intellectual
pleasure
'
in
her
prospective
*NL*
adventures
.
I
do
n't
in
the
least
want
to
see
her
going
down
hill
.
I
had
*NL*
rather
look
the
other
way
.
But
why
,
''
he
asked
,
in
a
moment
,
``
do
n't
you
*NL*
get
your
sister
to
go
and
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
stared
.
``
Go
and
see
Madame
Dandelard
--
my
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
might
talk
to
her
to
very
good
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
shook
his
head
with
sudden
gravity
.
``
My
sister
ca
n't
see
that
*NL*
sort
of
person
.
Madame
Dandelard
is
nothing
at
all
;
they
would
never
*NL*
meet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
your
sister
might
see
whom
she
*NL*
pleased
.
''
And
he
privately
resolved
that
after
he
knew
her
a
little
*NL*
better
he
would
ask
Madame
de
Cintre
to
go
and
talk
to
the
foolish
*NL*
little
Italian
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
dinner
with
Bellegarde
,
on
the
occasion
I
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
he
demurred
to
his
companion
's
proposal
that
they
should
go
again
and
*NL*
listen
to
Madame
Dandelard
describe
her
sorrows
and
her
bruises
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
something
better
in
mind
,
''
he
said
;
``
come
home
with
me
and
*NL*
finish
the
evening
before
my
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
always
welcomed
the
prospect
of
a
long
stretch
of
*NL*
conversation
,
and
before
long
the
two
men
sat
watching
the
great
blaze
*NL*
which
scattered
its
scintillations
over
the
high
adornments
of
Newman
's
*NL*
ball-room
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
something
about
your
sister
,
''
Newman
began
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
turned
and
gave
him
a
quick
look
.
``
Now
that
I
think
of
it
,
*NL*
you
have
never
yet
asked
me
a
question
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
because
you
do
n't
trust
me
,
you
are
very
right
,
''
said
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
``
I
ca
n't
talk
of
her
rationally
.
I
admire
her
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
of
her
as
you
can
,
''
rejoined
Newman
.
``
Let
yourself
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
are
very
good
friends
;
we
are
such
a
brother
and
sister
as
*NL*
have
not
been
seen
since
Orestes
and
Electra
.
You
have
seen
her
;
you
*NL*
know
what
she
is
:
tall
,
thin
,
light
,
imposing
,
and
gentle
,
half
a
grande
*NL*
dame
and
half
an
angel
;
a
mixture
of
pride
and
humility
,
of
the
eagle
*NL*
and
the
dove
.
She
looks
like
a
statue
which
had
failed
as
stone
,
*NL*
resigned
itself
to
its
grave
defects
,
and
come
to
life
as
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
,
to
wear
white
capes
and
long
trains
.
All
I
can
say
is
that
she
*NL*
really
possesses
every
merit
that
her
face
,
her
glance
,
her
smile
,
the
*NL*
tone
of
her
voice
,
lead
you
to
expect
;
it
is
saying
a
great
deal
.
As
a
*NL*
general
thing
,
when
a
woman
seems
very
charming
,
I
should
say
`
Beware
!
'
*NL*
But
in
proportion
as
Claire
seems
charming
you
may
fold
your
arms
and
*NL*
let
yourself
float
with
the
current
;
you
are
safe
.
She
is
so
good
!
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
a
woman
half
so
perfect
or
so
complete
.
She
has
*NL*
everything
;
that
is
all
I
can
say
about
her
.
There
!
''
Bellegarde
*NL*
concluded
;
``
I
told
you
I
should
rhapsodize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
while
,
as
if
he
were
turning
over
his
companion
's
*NL*
words
.
``
She
is
very
good
,
eh
?
''
he
repeated
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Divinely
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kind
,
charitable
,
gentle
,
generous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Generosity
itself
;
kindness
double-distilled
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
clever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
the
most
intelligent
woman
I
know
.
Try
her
,
some
day
,
with
*NL*
something
difficult
,
and
you
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
fond
of
admiration
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu
!
''
cried
Bellegarde
;
``
what
woman
is
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
when
they
are
too
fond
of
admiration
they
commit
all
kinds
of
*NL*
follies
to
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
say
she
was
too
fond
!
''
Bellegarde
exclaimed
.
``
Heaven
forbid
*NL*
I
should
say
anything
so
idiotic
.
She
is
not
too
anything
!
If
I
were
*NL*
to
say
she
was
ugly
,
I
should
not
mean
she
was
too
ugly
.
She
is
fond
*NL*
of
pleasing
,
and
if
you
are
pleased
she
is
grateful
.
If
you
are
not
*NL*
pleased
,
she
lets
it
pass
and
thinks
the
worst
neither
of
you
nor
of
*NL*
herself
.
I
imagine
,
though
,
she
hopes
the
saints
in
heaven
are
,
for
I
*NL*
am
sure
she
is
incapable
of
trying
to
please
by
any
means
of
which
they
*NL*
would
disapprove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
grave
or
gay
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
hesitated
a
moment
--
a
thing
he
very
rarely
did
.
``
Oh
,
my
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
if
I
go
into
the
history
of
my
family
I
shall
give
you
more
than
*NL*
you
bargain
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
bargain
for
that
,

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
to
appoint
a
special
seance
,
then
,
beginning
early
.
*NL*
Suffice
it
for
the
present
that
Claire
has
not
slept
on
roses
.
She
*NL*
made
at
eighteen
a
marriage
that
was
expected
to
be
brilliant
,
but
that
*NL*
turned
out
like
a
lamp
that
goes
out
;
all
smoke
and
bad
smell
.
M.
de
*NL*
Cintre
was
sixty
years
old
,
and
an
odious
old
gentleman
.
He
lived
,
*NL*
however
,
but
a
short
time
,
and
after
his
death
his
family
pounced
upon
*NL*
his
money
,
brought
a
lawsuit
against
his
widow
,
and
pushed
things
very
*NL*
hard
.
Their
case
was
a
good
one
,
for
M.
de
Cintre
,
who
had
been
trustee
*NL*
for
some
of
his
relatives
,
appeared
to
have
been
guilty
of
some
very
*NL*
irregular
practices
.
In
the
course
of
the
suit
some
revelations
were
*NL*
made
as
to
his
private
history
which
my
sister
found
so
displeasing
that
*NL*
she
ceased
to
defend
herself
and
washed
her
hands
of
the
property
.
This
*NL*
required
some
pluck
,
for
she
was
between
two
fires
,
her
husband
's
family
*NL*
opposing
her
and
her
own
family
forcing
her
.
My
mother
and
my
brother
*NL*
wished
her
to
cleave
to
what
they
regarded
as
her
rights
.
But
she
*NL*
resisted
firmly
,
and
at
last
bought
her
freedom
--
obtained
my
mother
's
*NL*
assent
to
dropping
the
suit
at
the
price
of
a
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
promise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
do
anything
else
,
for
the
next
ten
years

that
was
asked
of
*NL*
her
--
anything
,
that
is
,
but
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
disliked
her

very
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one

how
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
marriage
had
been
made
in
your
horrible
French
way
,

Newman
*NL*
continued
,
``
made
by
the
two
families
,
without
her
having
any
voice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
chapter
for
a
novel
.
She
saw
M.
de
Cintre
for
the
first
time
a
*NL*
month
before
the
wedding
,
after
everything
,
to
the
minutest
detail
,
*NL*
had
been
arranged
.
She
turned
white
when
she
looked
at
him
,
and
white
*NL*
remained
till
her
wedding-day
.
The
evening
before
the
ceremony
she
*NL*
swooned
away
,
and
she
spent
the
whole
night
in
sobs
.
My
mother
sat
*NL*
holding
her
two
hands
,
and
my
brother
walked
up
and
down
the
room
.
I
*NL*
declared
it
was
revolting
and
told
my
sister
publicly
that
if
she
would
*NL*
refuse
,
downright
,
I
would
stand
by
her
.
I
was
told
to
go
about
my
*NL*
business
,
and
she
became
Comtesse
de
Cintre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
,
''
said
Newman
,
reflectively
,
``
must
be
a
very
nice
young
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
very
nice
,
though
he

not
young

He
is
upward
of
fifty

fifteen

my
senior

He
has
been
a
father
to
my
sister

me

He
is
a
*NL*
very
remarkable
man
;
he
has
the
best
manners
in
France
.
He
is
extremely
*NL*
clever
;
indeed
he
is
very
learned
.
He
is
writing
a
history
of
The
*NL*
Princesses
of
France
Who
Never
Married

''
This
was
said
by
Bellegarde
*NL*
with
extreme
gravity
,
looking
straight
at
Newman
,
and
with
an
eye
that
*NL*
betokened
no
mental
reservation
;
or
that
,
at
least
,
almost
betokened
*NL*
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
perhaps
discovered
there
what
little
there
was
,
for
he
presently
*NL*
said
,
``
You
do
n't
love
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
Bellegarde
,
ceremoniously
;
``
well-bred
people
*NL*
always
love
their
brothers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
love
him
,
then
!
''
Newman
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
till
you
know
him
!
''
rejoined
Bellegarde
,
and
this
time
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
mother
also
very
remarkable
?
''
Newman
asked
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
mother
,
''
said
Bellegarde
,
now
with
intense
gravity
,
``
I
have
*NL*
the
highest
admiration

She
is
a
very
extraordinary
woman

You
can
not
*NL*
approach
her
without
perceiving
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
the
daughter

I
believe

of
an
English
nobleman

*NL*

Earl
of
St.
Dunstan

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
Earl
of
St.

's
a
very
old
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So-so
;
the
sixteenth
century
.
It
is
on
my
father
's
side
that
we
go
*NL*
back
--
back
,
back
,
back
.
The
family
antiquaries
themselves
lose
breath
.
*NL*
At
last
they
stop
,
panting
and
fanning
themselves
,
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
ninth
century
,
under
Charlemagne
.
That
is
where
we
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
mistake
about
it
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
hope
not

We
have
been
mistaken
at
least
for
several
*NL*
centuries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
always
married
into
old
families
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
rule
;
though
in
so
long
a
stretch
of
time
there
have
been
some
*NL*
exceptions
.
Three
or
four
Bellegardes
,
in
the
seventeenth
and
*NL*
eighteenth
centuries
,
took
wives
out
of
the
bourgoisie
--
married
lawyers
'
*NL*
daughters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lawyer
's
daughter
;
that
's
very
bad
,
is
it
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Horrible
!
one
of
us
,
in
the
middle
ages
,
did
better
:
he
married
a
*NL*
beggar-maid
,
like
King
Cophetua
.
That
was
really
better
;
it
was
like
*NL*
marrying
a
bird
or
a
monkey
;
one
did
n't
have
to
think
about
her
family
*NL*
at
all
.
Our
women
have
always
done
well
;
they
have
never
even
gone
into
*NL*
the
petite
noblesse
.
There
is
,
I
believe
,
not
a
case
on
record
of
a
*NL*
misalliance
among
the
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
turned
this
over
for
a
while
,
and
,
then
at
last
he
said
,
``
You
*NL*
offered
,
the
first
time
you
came
to
see
me

render
me
any
service

told
you
that
some
time
I
would
mention
something
you
might
do

Do
you
remember

*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember

have
been
counting

*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
stared
,
with
a
smile
.
``
Why
,
I
'm
sure
she
thinks
as
well
of

you
as
possible
,
already

*NL*
*NL*
``
An
opinion
founded
on
seeing
me
three
or
four
times

That
is
putting
me
*NL*
off
with
very
little
.
I
want
something
more
.
I
have
been
thinking
of
it
*NL*
a
good
deal
,
and
at
last
I
have
decided
to
tell
you
.
I
should
like
very
*NL*
much
to
marry
Madame
de
Cintre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
had
been
looking
at
him
with
quickened
expectancy
,
and
with
*NL*
the
smile
with
which
he
had
greeted
Newman
's
allusion
to
his
promised
*NL*
request
.
At
this
last
announcement
he
continued
to
gaze
;
but
his
*NL*
smile
went
through
two
or
three
curious
phases
.
It
felt
,
apparently
,
a
*NL*
momentary
impulse
to
broaden
;
but
this
it
immediately
checked
.
Then
it
*NL*
remained
for
some
instants
taking
counsel
with
itself
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
it
decreed
a
retreat
.
It
slowly
effaced
itself
and
left
a
look
of
*NL*
seriousness
modified
by
the
desire
not
to
be
rude
.
Extreme
surprise
had
*NL*
come
into
the
Count
Valentin
's
face
;
but
he
had
reflected
that
it
would
*NL*
be
uncivil
to
leave
it
there
.
And
yet
,
what
the
deuce
was
he
to
do
with
*NL*
it
?
He
got
up
,
in
his
agitation
,
and
stood
before
the
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
still
looking
at
Newman
.
He
was
a
longer
time
thinking
what
to
say
than
*NL*
one
would
have
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ca
n't
render
me
the
service
I
ask
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
say
it
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
hear
it
again
,
distinctly
,
''
said
Bellegarde
.
``
It
's
very
*NL*
important
,
you
know
.
I
shall
plead
your
cause
with
my
sister
,
because
*NL*
you
want
--
you
want
to
marry
her
?
That
's
it
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
say
plead
my
cause
,
exactly
;
I
shall
try
and
do
that
*NL*
myself
.
But
say
a
good
word
for
me
,
now
and
then
--
let
her
know
that
you
*NL*
think
well
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
,
Bellegarde
gave
a
little
light
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
want
chiefly
,
after
all
,
''
Newman
went
on
,
``
is
just
to
let
you
*NL*
know
what
I
have
in
mind

I
suppose
that
is
what
you

is
n't
it

I
*NL*
want
to
do
what
is
customary
over

If
there
is
any
thing
particular
*NL*
to
be
done

let
me
know

I
will
do
it

I
would
n't
for
the
world

approach
Madame
de
Cintre
without
all
the
proper
forms

If
I
ought
to
*NL*
go
and
tell
your
mother

why
I
will
go
and
tell
her
.
I
will
go
and
tell
*NL*
your
brother
,
even
.
I
will
go
and
tell
any
one
you
please

As
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
any
one
else
,
I
begin
by
telling
you
.
But
that
,
if
it
is
a
social
*NL*
obligation

is
a
pleasure
as
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
see

I
see

said
Bellegarde
,
lightly
stroking
his
chin
.
``
You
*NL*
have
a
very
right
feeling
about
it

but
I
'm
glad
you
have
begun
with

me
.
''
He
paused
,
hesitated
,
and
then
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
*NL*
the
length
of
the
room
.
Newman
got
up
and
stood
leaning
against
the
*NL*
mantel-shelf
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
watching
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
promenade
.
The
young
Frenchman
came
back
and
stopped
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
``
I
give
it
up
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
will
not
pretend
I
am
not
surprised

*NL*
am

hugely

Ouf

It
's
a
relief

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
Newman
.
``
No

Bellegarde

Newman

asked
Newman

Bellegarde
raised
his
hand
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
rubbed
his
hair
*NL*
quickly
up
and
down

thrusting
out
the
tip

his
tongue

he
did
so

I
am
going
to
undertake
to
*NL*
prove
that
I
am
noble
.
It
is
for
you
to
prove
the
contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
easily
done
.
You
have
manufactured
wash-tubs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stared
a
moment
.
``
Therefore
I
am
not
noble
?
I
do
n't
see
it
.
Tell
*NL*
me
something
I
have
NOT
done
--
something
I
can
not
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
marry
a
woman
like
Madame
de
Cintre
for
the
asking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
mean
,
''
said
Newman
slowly
,
``
that
I
am
not
good
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brutally
speaking
--
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
had
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
while
he
hesitated
Newman
's
*NL*
attentive
glance
had
grown
somewhat
eager
.
In
answer
to
these
last
words
*NL*
he
for
a
moment
said
nothing
.
He
simply
blushed
a
little
.
Then
he
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
stood
looking
at
one
of
the
rosy
cherubs
*NL*
that
was
painted
upon
it
.
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
expect
to
marry
any
*NL*
woman
for
the
asking
,
''
he
said
at
last
;
``
I
expect
first
to
make
myself
*NL*
acceptable
to
her
.
She
must
like
me
,
to
begin
with
.
But
that
I
am
not
*NL*
good
enough
to
make
a
trial
is
rather
a
surprise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
wore
a
look
of
mingled
perplexity
,
sympathy
,
and
amusement
.
*NL*
``
You
should
not
hesitate
,
then
,
to
go
up
to-morrow
and
ask
a
duchess
to
*NL*
marry
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
I
thought
she
would
suit
me
.
But
I
am
very
fastidious
;
she
might
*NL*
not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
's
amusement
began
to
prevail
.
``
And
you
should
be
surprised
if
*NL*
she
refused
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
It
sounds
conceited
to
say
yes
,
but
*NL*
nevertheless
I
think
I
should
.
For
I
should
make
a
very
handsome
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
she
wishes

If
I
get
hold
of
a
woman
that
comes
up
to
my
*NL*
standard
,
I
shall
think
nothing
too
good
for
her
.
I
have
been
a
long
*NL*
time
looking
,
and
I
find
such
women
are
rare
.
To
combine
the
qualities
I
*NL*
require
seems
to
be
difficult
,
but
when
the
difficulty
is
vanquished
*NL*
it
deserves
a
reward
.
My
wife
shall
have
a
good
position
,
and
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
to
say
that
I
shall
be
a
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
these
qualities
that
you
require

what
are
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness

beauty

intelligence

a
fine

everything

that
makes
a
splendid

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

said
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

that
in

by
all

it
's
there

The
more
the
better

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
sister
seems
to
you
to
have
all
these
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
exactly
what
I
have
been
looking
for
.
She
is
my
dream
realized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
make
her
a
very
good
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
wanted
you
to
tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
's
arm
a
moment
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
from
head
to
foot
,
and
then
,
with
a
loud
*NL*
laugh
,
and
shaking
the
other
hand
in
the
air
,
turned
away
.
He
walked
*NL*
again
the
length
of
the
room
,
and
again
he
came
back
and
stationed
*NL*
himself
in
front
of
Newman
.
``
All
this
is
very
interesting
--
it
is
very
*NL*
curious
.
In
what
I
said
just
now
I
was
speaking
,
not
for
myself
,
but
*NL*
for
my
tradition
,
my
superstitions
.
For
myself
,
really
,
your
proposal
*NL*
tickles
me
.
It
startled
me
at
first
,
but
the
more
I
think
of
it
the
*NL*
more
I
see
in
it
.
It
's
no
use
attempting
to
explain
anything
;
you
wo
n't
*NL*
understand
me
.
After
all
,
I
do
n't
see
why
you
need
;
it
's
no
great
loss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
there
is
anything
more
to
explain
,
try
it
!
I
want
to
proceed
*NL*
with
my
eyes
open
.
I
will
do
my
best
to
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Bellegarde
,
``
it
's
disagreeable
to
me
;
I
give
it
up
.
I
liked
*NL*
you
the
first
time
I
saw
you
,
and
I
will
abide
by
that
.
It
would
be
*NL*
quite
odious
for
me
to
come
talking
to
you
as
if
I
could
patronize
you
.
*NL*
I
have
told
you
before
that
I
envy
you
;
vous
m
`
imposez
,
as
we
say
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
you
much
until
within
five
minutes
.
So
we
will
let
things
*NL*
go
,
and
I
will
say
nothing
to
you
that
,
if
our
positions
were
reversed
,
*NL*
you
would
not
say
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
whether
in
renouncing
the
mysterious
opportunity
to
which
*NL*
he
alluded
,
Bellegarde
felt
that
he
was
doing
something
very
generous
.
*NL*
If
so
,
he
was
not
rewarded
;
his
generosity
was
not
appreciated
.
Newman
*NL*
quite
failed
to
recognize
the
young
Frenchman
's
power
to
wound
his
*NL*
feelings
,
and
he
had
now
no
sense
of
escaping
or
coming
off
easily
.
*NL*
He
did
not
thank
his
companion
even
with
a
glance
.
``
My
eyes
are
open
,
*NL*
though
,
''
he
said
,
``
so
far
as
that
you
have
practically
told
me
that
your
*NL*
family
and
your
friends
will
turn
up
their
noses
at
me
.
I
have
never
*NL*
thought
much
about
the
reasons
that
make
it
proper
for
people
to
turn
up
*NL*
their
noses
,
and
so
I
can
only
decide
the
question
off-hand
.
Looking
at
*NL*
it
in
that
way
I
ca
n't
see
anything
in
it
.
I
simply
think
,
if
you
want
*NL*
to
know
,
that
I
'm
as
good
as
the
best
.
Who
the
best
are
,
I
do
n't
pretend
*NL*
to
say
.
I
have
never
thought
much
about
that
either
.
To
tell
the
*NL*
truth
,
I
have
always
had
rather
a
good
opinion
of
myself
;
a
man
who
is
*NL*
successful
ca
n't
help
it
.
But
I
will
admit
that
I
was
conceited
.
What
*NL*
I
do
n't
say
yes
to
is
that
I
do
n't
stand
high
--
as
high
as
any
one
else
.
*NL*
This
is
a
line
of
speculation
I
should
not
have
chosen
,
but
you
must
*NL*
remember
you
began
it
yourself
.
I
should
never
have
dreamed
that
I
was
*NL*
on
the
defensive
,
or
that
I
had
to
justify
myself
;
but
if
your
people
*NL*
will
have
it
so
,
I
will
do
my
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
offered
,
a
while
ago
,
to
make
your
court
as
we
say
,
to
my
*NL*
mother
and
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
!
''
cried
Newman
,
``
I
want
to
be
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
rejoined
Bellegarde
;
``
this
will
go
far
,
it
will
be
very
*NL*
entertaining
.
Excuse
my
speaking
of
it
in
that
cold-blooded
fashion
,
but
*NL*
the
matter
must
,
of
necessity
,
be
for
me
something
of
a
spectacle
.
It
's
*NL*
positively
exciting
.
But
apart
from
that
I
sympathize
with
you
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
be
actor
,
so
far
as
I
can
,
as
well
as
spectator
.
You
are
a
capital
*NL*
fellow
;
I
believe
in
you
and
I
back
you
.
The
simple
fact
that
you
*NL*
appreciate
my
sister
will
serve
as
the
proof
I
was
asking
for
.
All
men
*NL*
are
equal
--
especially
men
of
taste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
asked
Newman
presently
,
``
that
Madame
de
Cintre
is
*NL*
determined
not
to
marry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
impression
.
But
that
is
not
against
you
;
it
's
for
you
to
*NL*
make
her
change
her
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
will
be
hard
,
''
said
Newman
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
will
be
easy
.
In
a
general
way
I
do
n't
see
why
a
*NL*
widow
should
ever
marry
again
.
She
has
gained
the
benefits
of
*NL*
matrimony
--
freedom
and
consideration
--
and
she
has
got
rid
of
the
*NL*
drawbacks
.
Why
should
she
put
her
head
into
the
noose
again
?
Her
usual
*NL*
motive
is
ambition
:
if
a
man
can
offer
her
a
great
position
,
make
her
a
*NL*
princess
or
an
ambassadress
she
may
think
the
compensation
sufficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
--
in
that
way
--
is
Madame
de
Cintre
ambitious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
?
''
said
Bellegarde
,
with
a
profound
shrug
.
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
*NL*
say
all
that
she
is
or
all
that
she
is
not
.
I
think
she
might
be
touched
*NL*
by
the
prospect
of
becoming
the
wife
of
a
great
man
.
But
in
a
certain
*NL*
way
,
I
believe
,
whatever
she
does
will
be
the
IMPROBABLE
.
Do
n't
be
too
*NL*
confident
,
but
do
n't
absolutely
doubt
.
Your
best
chance
for
success
will
*NL*
be
precisely
in
being
,
to
her
mind
,
unusual
,
unexpected
,
original
.
Do
n't
*NL*
try
to
be
any
one
else
;
be
simply
yourself
,
out
and
out
.
Something
or
*NL*
other
ca
n't
fail
to
come
of
it
;
I
am
very
curious
to
see
what
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
advice

said
Newman
.
``
And
,
''
he
added
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
``
I
am
glad
,
for
your
sake
,
I
am
going
to
be
so
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
more
than
amusing
,
''
said
Bellegarde
;
``
it
will
be
inspiring
.
*NL*
I
look
at
it
from
my
point
of
view
,
and
you
from
yours
.
After
all
,
*NL*
anything
for
a
change
!
And
only
yesterday
I
was
yawning
so
as
to
*NL*
dislocate
my
jaw
,
and
declaring
that
there
was
nothing
new
under
the
*NL*
sun
!
If
it
is
n't
new
to
see
you
come
into
the
family
as
a
suitor

I
am
*NL*
very
much
mistaken

Let
me
say
that
,
my
dear
fellow
;
I
wo
n't
call
it
*NL*
anything
else
,
bad
or
good
;
I
will
simply
call
it
NEW

And
overcome
with
*NL*
a
sense
of
the
novelty
thus
foreshadowed
,
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
threw
*NL*
himself
into
a
deep
arm-chair
before
the
fire
,
and
,
with
a
fixed
,
*NL*
intense
smile
,
seemed
to
read
a
vision
of
it
in
the
flame
of
the
logs
.
*NL*
After
a
while
he
looked
up
.
``
Go
ahead
,
my
boy
;
you
have
my
good
wishes
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
But
it
is
really
a
pity

Newman

laughing

``

*NL*
Bellegarde
sprang
up
again
;
he
was
evidently
excited

there
was
a
warmer

spark
even
than
usual
in
his
eye

You

always

But
it
does

I
shall
get
my

fun
out
of
it

And
he
*NL*
broke
into
an
extravagant
laugh
.
``
You
look
puzzled

he
added
;

you
look

almost
frightened

*NL*

Newman

some
very
good

went
on

``
I

I
verily

stranger

either

You
will
even
find

strange

*NL*
``
Very

Newman
;

putting
out

And
he
stood
holding

askance

Bellegarde
laid
his
fingers
upon
his
lips
with
a
whispered
HUSH

be
assured
of
my
sympathy
!
''
And
on
this
he
took
*NL*
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
dropped
into
a
chair
before
his
fire
,
and
sat
a
long
time
staring
*NL*
into
the
blaze
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
see
Madame
de
Cintre
the
next
day
,
and
was
informed
by
the
*NL*
servant
that
she
was
at
home
.
He
passed
as
usual
up
the
large
,
cold
*NL*
staircase
and
through
a
spacious
vestibule
above
,
where
the
walls
seemed
*NL*
all
composed
of
small
door
panels
,
touched
with
long-faded
gilding
;
*NL*
whence
he
was
ushered
into
the
sitting-room
in
which
he
had
already
been
*NL*
received
.
It
was
empty
,
and
the
servant
told
him
that
Madame
la
Comtesse
*NL*
would
presently
appear
.
He
had
time
,
while
he
waited
,
to
wonder
whether
*NL*
Bellegarde
had
seen
his
sister
since
the
evening
before
,
and
whether
*NL*
in
this
case
he
had
spoken
to
her
of
their
talk
.
In
this
case
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
's
receiving
him
was
an
encouragement
.
He
felt
a
certain
*NL*
trepidation
as
he
reflected
that
she
might
come
in
with
the
knowledge
*NL*
of
his
supreme
admiration
and
of
the
project
he
had
built
upon
it
in
her
*NL*
eyes
;
but
the
feeling
was
not
disagreeable
.
Her
face
could
wear
no
*NL*
look
that
would
make
it
less
beautiful
,
and
he
was
sure
beforehand
that
*NL*
however
she
might
take
the
proposal
he
had
in
reserve
,
she
would
not
*NL*
take
it
in
scorn
or
in
irony
.
He
had
a
feeling
that
if
she
could
only
*NL*
read
the
bottom
of
his
heart
and
measure
the
extent
of
his
good
will
*NL*
toward
her
,
she
would
be
entirely
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
in
at
last
,
after
so
long
an
interval
that
he
wondered
whether
*NL*
she
had
been
hesitating
.
She
smiled
with
her
usual
frankness
,
and
held
*NL*
out
her
hand
;
she
looked
at
him
straight
with
her
soft
and
luminous
*NL*
eyes
,
and
said
,
without
a
tremor
in
her
voice
,
that
she
was
glad
to
see
*NL*
him
and
that
she
hoped
he
was
well
.
He
found
in
her
what
he
had
found
*NL*
before
--
that
faint
perfume
of
a
personal
shyness
worn
away
by
contact
*NL*
with
the
world
,
but
the
more
perceptible
the
more
closely
you
approached
*NL*
her
.
This
lingering
diffidence
seemed
to
give
a
peculiar
value
to
*NL*
what
was
definite
and
assured
in
her
manner
;
it
made
it
seem
like
an
*NL*
accomplishment
,
a
beautiful
talent
,
something
that
one
might
compare
*NL*
to
an
exquisite
touch
in
a
pianist
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
Madame
de
Cintre
's
*NL*
``
authority
,
''
as
they
say
of
artists
,
that
especially
impressed
and
*NL*
fascinated
Newman
;
he
always
came
back
to
the
feeling
that
when
he
*NL*
should
complete
himself
by
taking
a
wife
,
that
was
the
way
he
should
*NL*
like
his
wife
to
interpret
him
to
the
world
.
The
only
trouble
,
indeed
,
*NL*
was
that
when
the
instrument
was
so
perfect
it
seemed
to
interpose
too
*NL*
much
between
you
and
the
genius
that
used
it
.
Madame
de
Cintre
gave
*NL*
Newman
the
sense
of
an
elaborate
education
,
of
her
having
passed
through
*NL*
mysterious
ceremonies
and
processes
of
culture
in
her
youth
,
of
her
*NL*
having
been
fashioned
and
made
flexible
to
certain
exalted
social
needs
.
*NL*
All
this
,
as
I
have
affirmed
,
made
her
seem
rare
and
precious
--
a
very
*NL*
expensive
article
,
as
he
would
have
said
,
and
one
which
a
man
with
an
*NL*
ambition
to
have
everything
about
him
of
the
best
would
find
it
highly
*NL*
agreeable
to
possess
.
But
looking
at
the
matter
with
an
eye
to
private
*NL*
felicity
,
Newman
wondered
where
,
in
so
exquisite
a
compound
,
nature
and
*NL*
art
showed
their
dividing
line
.
Where
did
the
special
intention
separate
*NL*
from
the
habit
of
good
manners
?
Where
did
urbanity
end
and
sincerity
*NL*
begin
?
Newman
asked
himself
these
questions
even
while
he
stood
ready
to
*NL*
accept
the
admired
object
in
all
its
complexity
;
he
felt
that
he
could
*NL*
do
so
in
profound
security
,
and
examine
its
mechanism
afterwards
,
at
*NL*
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
find
you
alone
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
know
I
have
never
had
*NL*
such
good
luck
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
seemed
before
very
well
contented
with
your
luck
,
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
You
have
sat
and
watched
my
visitors
with
an
air
of
*NL*
quiet
amusement
.
What
have
you
thought
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
thought
the
ladies
were
very
elegant
and
very
graceful
,
and
*NL*
wonderfully
quick
at
repartee
.
But
what
I
have
chiefly
thought
has
*NL*
been
that
they
only
helped
me
to
admire
you
.
''
This
was
not
gallantry
on
*NL*
Newman
's
part
--
an
art
in
which
he
was
quite
unversed
.
It
was
simply
the
*NL*
instinct
of
the
practical
man
,
who
had
made
up
his
mind
what
he
wanted
,
*NL*
and
was
now
beginning
to
take
active
steps
to
obtain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
started
slightly
,
and
raised
her
eyebrows
;
she
had
*NL*
evidently
not
expected
so
fervid
a
compliment
.
``
Oh
,
in
that
case
,
''
she
*NL*
said
with
a
laugh
,
``
your
finding
me
alone
is
not
good
luck
for
me
.
I
*NL*
hope
some
one
will
come
in
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
have
something
particular
to
say
to
you
.
*NL*
Have
you
seen
your
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
an
hour
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
tell
you
that
he
had
seen
me
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
tell
you
what
we
had
talked
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
hesitated
a
moment
.
As
Newman
asked
these
questions
*NL*
she
had
grown
a
little
pale
,
as
if
she
regarded
what
was
coming
as
*NL*
necessary
,
but
not
as
agreeable
.
``
Did
you
give
him
a
message
to
me
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
exactly
a
message
--
I
asked
him
to
render
me
a
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
service
was
to
sing
your
praises
,
was
it
not
?
''
And
she
accompanied
*NL*
this
question
with
a
little
smile
,
as
if
to
make
it
easier
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
what
it
really
amounts
to
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Did
he
sing
my
*NL*
praises
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spoke
very
well
of
you
.
But
when
I
know
that
it
was
by
your
special
*NL*
request
,
of
course
I
must
take
his
eulogy
with
a
grain
of
salt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
makes
no
difference
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Your
brother
would
not
*NL*
have
spoken
well
of
me
unless
he
believed
what
he
was
saying
.
He
is
too
*NL*
honest
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
deep
?
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
Are
you
trying
to
please
me
*NL*
by
praising
my
brother
?
I
confess
it
is
a
good
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
,
any
way
that
succeeds
will
be
good
.
I
will
praise
your
brother
*NL*
all
day
,
if
that
will
help
me
.
He
is
a
noble
little
fellow
.
He
has
made
*NL*
me
feel
,
in
promising
to
do
what
he
can
to
help
me
,
that
I
can
depend
*NL*
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
make
too
much
of
that
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
He
can
help
you
*NL*
very
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
must
work
my
way
myself
.
I
know
that
very
well
;
I
only
want
*NL*
a
chance
to
.
In
consenting
to
see
me
,
after
what
he
told
you
,
you
almost
*NL*
seem
to
be
giving
me
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
seeing
you
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
slowly
and
gravely
,
``
because
I
*NL*
promised
my
brother
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessings
on
your
brother
's
head
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
What
I
told
him
last
*NL*
evening
was
this
:
that
I
admired
you
more
than
any
woman
I
had
ever
*NL*
seen
,
and
that
I
should
like
immensely
to
make
you
my
wife
.
''
He
uttered
*NL*
these
words
with
great
directness
and
firmness
,
and
without
any
sense
of
*NL*
confusion
.
He
was
full
of
his
idea
,
he
had
completely
mastered
it
,
*NL*
and
he
seemed
to
look
down
on
Madame
de
Cintre
,
with
all
her
gathered
*NL*
elegance
,
from
the
height
of
his
bracing
good
conscience
.
It
is
probable
*NL*
that
this
particular
tone
and
manner
were
the
very
best
he
could
have
*NL*
hit
upon
.
Yet
the
light
,
just
visibly
forced
smile
with
which
his
*NL*
companion
had
listened
to
him
died
away
,
and
she
sat
looking
at
him
*NL*
with
her
lips
parted
and
her
face
as
solemn
as
a
tragic
mask
.
There
was
*NL*
evidently
something
very
painful
to
her
in
the
scene
to
which
he
was
*NL*
subjecting
her
,
and
yet
her
impatience
of
it
found
no
angry
voice
.
*NL*
Newman
wondered
whether
he
was
hurting
her
;
he
could
not
imagine
why
the
*NL*
liberal
devotion
he
meant
to
express
should
be
disagreeable
.
He
got
up
*NL*
and
stood
before
her
,
leaning
one
hand
on
the
chimney-piece
.
``
I
know
I
*NL*
have
seen
you
very
little
to
say
this
,
''
he
said
,
``
so
little
that
it
may
*NL*
make
what
I
say
seem
disrespectful
.
That
is
my
misfortune
!
I
could
have
*NL*
said
it
the
first
time
I
saw
you
.
Really
,
I
had
seen
you
before
;
I
had
*NL*
seen
you
in
imagination
;
you
seemed
almost
an
old
friend
.
So
what
I
say
*NL*
is
not
mere
gallantry
and
compliments
and
nonsense
--
I
ca
n't
talk
that
*NL*
way
,
I
do
n't
know
how
,
and
I
would
n't
,
to
you
,
if
I
could
.
It
's
as
*NL*
serious
as
such
words
can
be
.
I
feel
as
if
I
knew
you
and
knew
what
a
*NL*
beautiful
,
admirable
woman
you
are
.
I
shall
know
better
,
perhaps
,
some
*NL*
day
,
but
I
have
a
general
notion
now
.
You
are
just
the
woman
I
have
*NL*
been
looking
for
,
except
that
you
are
far
more
perfect
.
I
wo
n't
make
any
*NL*
protestations
and
vows
,
but
you
can
trust
me
.
It
is
very
soon
,
I
know
,
*NL*
to
say
all
this
;
it
is
almost
offensive
.
But
why
not
gain
time
if
one
*NL*
can
?
And
if
you
want
time
to
reflect
--
of
course
you
do
--
the
sooner
you
*NL*
begin
,
the
better
for
me
.
I
do
n't
know
what
you
think
of
me
;
but
there
*NL*
is
no
great
mystery
about
me
;
you
see
what
I
am
.
Your
brother
told
me
*NL*
that
my
antecedents
and
occupations
were
against
me
;
that
your
family
*NL*
stands
,
somehow
,
on
a
higher
level
than
I
do
.
That
is
an
idea
which
of
*NL*
course
I
do
n't
understand
and
do
n't
accept
.
But
you
do
n't
care
anything
*NL*
about
that
.
I
can
assure
you
that
I
am
a
very
solid
fellow
,
and
that
if
*NL*
I
give
my
mind
to
it
I
can
arrange
things
so
that
in
a
very
few
years
I
*NL*
shall
not
need
to
waste
time
in
explaining
who
I
am
and
what
I
am
.
You
*NL*
will
decide
for
yourself
whether
you
like
me
or
not
.
What
there
is
*NL*
you
see
before
you
.
I
honestly
believe
I
have
no
hidden
vices
or
nasty
*NL*
tricks
.
I
am
kind
,
kind
,
kind
!
Everything
that
a
man
can
give
a
woman
I
*NL*
will
give
you
.
I
have
a
large
fortune
,
a
very
large
fortune
;
some
day
,
*NL*
if
you
will
allow
me
,
I
will
go
into
details
.
If
you
want
brilliancy
,
*NL*
everything
in
the
way
of
brilliancy
that
money
can
give
you
,
you
shall
*NL*
have
.
And
as
regards
anything
you
may
give
up
,
do
n't
take
for
granted
*NL*
too
much
that
its
place
can
not
be
filled
.
Leave
that
to
me
;
I
'll
take
*NL*
care
of
you
;
I
shall
know
what
you
need
.
Energy
and
ingenuity
can
*NL*
arrange
everything
.
I
'm
a
strong
man
!
There
,
I
have
said
what
I
had
*NL*
on
my
heart
!
It
was
better
to
get
it
off
.
I
am
very
sorry
if
it
's
*NL*
disagreeable
to
you
;
but
think
how
much
better
it
is
that
things
should
*NL*
be
clear
.
Do
n't
answer
me
now
,
if
you
do
n't
wish
it
.
Think
about
it
,
*NL*
think
about
it
as
slowly
as
you
please
.
Of
course
I
have
n't
said
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
,
half
I
mean
,
especially
about
my
admiration
for
you
.
But
take
*NL*
a
favorable
view
of
me
;
it
will
only
be
just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
speech
,
the
longest
that
Newman
had
ever
made
,
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
kept
her
gaze
fixed
upon
him
,
and
it
expanded
at
the
last
into
a
*NL*
sort
of
fascinated
stare
.
When
he
ceased
speaking
she
lowered
her
eyes
*NL*
and
sat
for
some
moments
looking
down
and
straight
before
her
.
Then
she
*NL*
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
,
and
a
pair
of
exceptionally
keen
eyes
would
*NL*
have
perceived
that
she
was
trembling
a
little
in
the
movement
.
She
*NL*
still
looked
extremely
serious
.
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
*NL*
your
offer
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
seems
very
strange
,
but
I
am
glad
you
*NL*
spoke
without
waiting
any
longer
.
It
is
better
the
subject
should
be
*NL*
dismissed
.
I
appreciate
all
you
say
;
you
do
me
great
honor
.
But
I
have
*NL*
decided
not
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
say
that
!
''
cried
Newman
,
in
a
tone
absolutely
naif
from
its
*NL*
pleading
and
caressing
cadence
.
She
had
turned
away
,
and
it
made
her
*NL*
stop
a
moment
with
her
back
to
him
.
``
Think
better
of
that
.
You
are
*NL*
too
young
,
too
beautiful
,
too
much
made
to
be
happy
and
to
make
others
*NL*
happy
.
If
you
are
afraid
of
losing
your
freedom
,
I
can
assure
you
that
*NL*
this
freedom
here
,
this
life
you
now
lead
,
is
a
dreary
bondage
to
what
*NL*
I
will
offer
you
.
You
shall
do
things
that
I
do
n't
think
you
have
ever
*NL*
thought
of
.
I
will
take
you
anywhere
in
the
wide
world
that
you
propose
.
*NL*
Are
you
unhappy
?
You
give
me
a
feeling
that
you
are
unhappy
.
You
have
no
*NL*
right
to
be
,
or
to
be
made
so
.
Let
me
come
in
and
put
an
end
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
stood
there
a
moment
longer
,
looking
away
from
him
.
*NL*
If
she
was
touched
by
the
way
he
spoke
,
the
thing
was
conceivable
.
His
*NL*
voice
,
always
very
mild
and
interrogative
,
gradually
became
as
soft
*NL*
and
as
tenderly
argumentative
as
if
he
had
been
talking
to
a
much-loved
*NL*
child
.
He
stood
watching
her
,
and
she
presently
turned
round
again
,
but
*NL*
this
time
she
did
not
look
at
him
,
and
she
spoke
in
a
quietness
in
which
*NL*
there
was
a
visible
trace
of
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
a
great
many
reasons
why
I
should
not
marry
,
''
she
said
,
``
more
*NL*
than
I
can
explain
to
you
.
As
for
my
happiness
,
I
am
very
happy
.
Your
*NL*
offer
seems
strange
to
me
,
for
more
reasons
also
than
I
can
say
.
Of
*NL*
course
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
make
it
.
But
I
can
not
accept
it
--
it
*NL*
is
impossible
.
Please
never
speak
of
this
matter
again
.
If
you
can
not
*NL*
promise
me
this
,
I
must
ask
you
not
to
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
impossible
?
''
Newman
demanded
.
``
You
may
think
it
is
,
at
first
,
*NL*
without
its
really
being
so
.
I
did
n't
expect
you
to
be
pleased
at
first
,
*NL*
but
I
do
believe
that
if
you
will
think
of
it
a
good
while
,
you
may
be
*NL*
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
you
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
Think
how
little
I
know
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
,
of
course
,
and
therefore
I
do
n't
ask
for
your
ultimatum
on
*NL*
the
spot
.
I
only
ask
you
not
to
say
no
,
and
to
let
me
hope
.
I
will
wait
*NL*
as
long
as
you
desire
.
Meanwhile
you
can
see
more
of
me
and
know
me
*NL*
better
,
look
at
me
as
a
possible
husband
--
as
a
candidate
--
and
make
up
*NL*
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
was
going
on
,
rapidly
,
in
Madame
de
Cintre
's
thoughts
;
she
*NL*
was
weighing
a
question
there
,
beneath
Newman
's
eyes
,
weighing
it
and
*NL*
deciding
it
.
``
From
the
moment
I
do
n't
very
respectfully
beg
you
to
leave
*NL*
the
house
and
never
return
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
listen
to
you
,
I
seem
to
give
*NL*
you
hope
.
I
HAVE
listened
to
you
--
against
my
judgment
.
It
is
because
you
*NL*
are
eloquent
.
If
I
had
been
told
this
morning
that
I
should
consent
to
*NL*
consider
you
as
a
possible
husband
,
I
should
have
thought
my
informant
*NL*
a
little
crazy
.
I
AM
listening
to
you
,
you
see
!
''
And
she
threw
her
hands
*NL*
out
for
a
moment
and
let
them
drop
with
a
gesture
in
which
there
was
*NL*
just
the
slightest
expression
of
appealing
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
as
far
as
saying
goes
,
I
have
said
everything
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
in
you
,
without
restriction
,
and
I
think
all
the
good
of
you
*NL*
that
it
is
possible
to
think
of
a
human
creature
.
I
firmly
believe
that
*NL*
in
marrying
me
you
will
be
SAFE
.
As
I
said
just
now
,
''
he
went
on
with
*NL*
a
smile
,
``
I
have
no
bad
ways
.
I
can
DO
so
much
for
you
.
And
if
you
are
*NL*
afraid
that
I
am
not
what
you
have
been
accustomed
to
,
not
refined
*NL*
and
delicate
and
punctilious
,
you
may
easily
carry
that
too
far
.
I
AM
*NL*
delicate
!
You
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
walked
some
distance
away
,
and
paused
before
a
great
*NL*
plant
,
an
azalea
,
which
was
flourishing
in
a
porcelain
tub
before
her
*NL*
window
.
She
plucked
off
one
of
the
flowers
and
,
twisting
it
in
her
*NL*
fingers
,
retraced
her
steps
.
Then
she
sat
down
in
silence
,
and
her
*NL*
attitude
seemed
to
be
a
consent
that
Newman
should
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
say
it
is
impossible
you
should
marry
?
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
that
could
make
it
really
impossible
would
be
your
being
*NL*
already
married
.
Is
it
because
you
have
been
unhappy
in
marriage
?
That
*NL*
is
all
the
more
reason
!
Is
it
because
your
family
exert
a
pressure
upon
*NL*
you
,
interfere
with
you
,
annoy
you
?
That
is
still
another
reason
;
you
*NL*
ought
to
be
perfectly
free
,
and
marriage
will
make
you
so
.
I
do
n't
say
*NL*
anything
against
your
family
--
understand
that
!
''
added
Newman
,
with
*NL*
an
eagerness
which
might
have
made
a
perspicacious
observer
smile
.
*NL*
``
Whatever
way
you
feel
toward
them
is
the
right
way
,
and
anything
that
*NL*
you
should
wish
me
to
do
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
them
I
will
do
as
*NL*
well
as
I
know
how
.
Depend
upon
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
rose
again
and
came
toward
the
fireplace
,
near
which
*NL*
Newman
was
standing
.
The
expression
of
pain
and
embarrassment
had
passed
*NL*
out
of
her
face
,
and
it
was
illuminated
with
something
which
,
this
time
*NL*
at
least
,
Newman
need
not
have
been
perplexed
whether
to
attribute
to
*NL*
habit
or
to
intention
,
to
art
or
to
nature
.
She
had
the
air
of
a
woman
*NL*
who
has
stepped
across
the
frontier
of
friendship
and
,
looking
around
*NL*
her
,
finds
the
region
vast
.
A
certain
checked
and
controlled
exaltation
*NL*
seemed
mingled
with
the
usual
level
radiance
of
her
glance
.
``
I
will
not
*NL*
refuse
to
see
you
again
,
''
she
said
,
``
because
much
of
what
you
have
said
*NL*
has
given
me
pleasure
.
But
I
will
see
you
only
on
this
condition
:
that
*NL*
you
say
nothing
more
in
the
same
way
for
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
how
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
six
months
.
It
must
be
a
solemn
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
promise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
then
,
''
she
said
,
and
extended
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
it
a
moment
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
more
.
But
he
*NL*
only
looked
at
her
;
then
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
on
the
Boulevard
,
he
met
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
.
After
*NL*
they
had
exchanged
greetings
,
Newman
told
him
that
he
had
seen
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
a
few
hours
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
''
said
Bellegarde
.
``
I
dined
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
.
''
*NL*
And
then
,
for
some
moments
,
both
men
were
silent
.
Newman
wished
to
ask
*NL*
Bellegarde
what
visible
impression
his
visit
had
made
and
the
Count
*NL*
Valentin
had
a
question
of
his
own
.
Bellegarde
spoke
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
none
of
my
business
,
but
what
the
deuce
did
you
say
to
my
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
willing
to
tell
you
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
I
made
her
an
offer
of
*NL*
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
!
''
And
the
young
man
gave
a
whistle
.
''
`
Time
is
money
!
'
Is
*NL*
that
what
you
say
in
America
?
And
Madame
de
Cintre
?
''
he
added
,
with
an
*NL*
interrogative
inflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
not
accept
my
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
,
you
know
,
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
to
see
her
again
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
strangeness
of
woman
!
''
exclaimed
Bellegarde
.
Then
he
stopped
,
*NL*
and
held
Newman
off
at
arms
'
-
length
.
``
I
look
at
you
with
respect
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
.
``
You
have
achieved
what
we
call
a
personal
success
!
*NL*
Immediately
,
now
,
I
must
present
you
to
my
brother
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
please

said
Newman
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
continued
to
see
his
friends
the
Tristrams
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
frequency
,
though
if
you
had
listened
to
Mrs.
Tristram
's
account
of
the
*NL*
matter
you
would
have
supposed
that
they
had
been
cynically
repudiated
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
grander
acquaintance
.
``
We
were
all
very
well
so
long
*NL*
as
we
had
no
rivals
--
we
were
better
than
nothing
.
But
now
that
you
have
*NL*
become
the
fashion
,
and
have
your
pick
every
day
of
three
invitations
to
*NL*
dinner
,
we
are
tossed
into
the
corner
.
I
am
sure
it
is
very
good
of
you
*NL*
to
come
and
see
us
once
a
month
;
I
wonder
you
do
n't
send
us
your
cards
*NL*
in
an
envelope
.
When
you
do
,
pray
have
them
with
black
edges
;
it
will
be
*NL*
for
the
death
of
my
last
illusion
.
''
It
was
in
this
incisive
strain
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
moralized
over
Newman
's
so-called
neglect
,
which
was
in
*NL*
reality
a
most
exemplary
constancy
.
Of
course
she
was
joking
,
but
*NL*
there
was
always
something
ironical
in
her
jokes
,
as
there
was
always
*NL*
something
jocular
in
her
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
no
better
proof
that
I
have
treated
you
very
well
,
''
Newman
*NL*
had
said
,
``
than
the
fact
that
you
make
so
free
with
my
character
.
*NL*
Familiarity
breeds
contempt
;
I
have
made
myself
too
cheap
.
If
I
had
a
*NL*
little
proper
pride
I
would
stay
away
a
while
,
and
when
you
asked
me
to
*NL*
dinner
say
I
was
going
to
the
Princess
Borealska
's
.
But
I
have
not
any
*NL*
pride
where
my
pleasure
is
concerned
,
and
to
keep
you
in
the
humor
to
*NL*
see
me
--
if
you
must
see
me
only
to
call
me
bad
names
--
I
will
agree
to
*NL*
anything
you
choose
;
I
will
admit
that
I
am
the
biggest
snob
in
Paris
.
''
*NL*
Newman
,
in
fact
,
had
declined
an
invitation
personally
given
by
the
*NL*
Princess
Borealska
,
an
inquiring
Polish
lady
to
whom
he
had
been
*NL*
presented
,
on
the
ground
that
on
that
particular
day
he
always
dined
*NL*
at
Mrs.
Tristram
's
;
and
it
was
only
a
tenderly
perverse
theory
of
*NL*
his
hostess
of
the
Avenue
d'Iena
that
he
was
faithless
to
his
early
*NL*
friendships
.
She
needed
the
theory
to
explain
a
certain
moral
irritation
*NL*
by
which
she
was
often
visited
;
though
,
if
this
explanation
was
unsound
,
*NL*
a
deeper
analyst
than
I
must
give
the
right
one
.
Having
launched
our
*NL*
hero
upon
the
current
which
was
bearing
him
so
rapidly
along
,
she
*NL*
appeared
but
half-pleased
at
its
swiftness
.
She
had
succeeded
too
well
;
*NL*
she
had
played
her
game
too
cleverly
and
she
wished
to
mix
up
the
cards
.
*NL*
Newman
had
told
her
,
in
due
season
,
that
her
friend
was
``
satisfactory
.
''
*NL*
The
epithet
was
not
romantic
,
but
Mrs.
Tristram
had
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
perceiving
that
,
in
essentials
,
the
feeling
which
lay
beneath
it
was
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
mild
,
expansive
brevity
with
which
it
was
uttered
,
and
*NL*
a
certain
look
,
at
once
appealing
and
inscrutable
,
that
issued
from
*NL*
Newman
's
half-closed
eyes
as
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
back
of
his
*NL*
chair
,
seemed
to
her
the
most
eloquent
attestation
of
a
mature
sentiment
*NL*
that
she
had
ever
encountered
.
Newman
was
,
according
to
the
French
*NL*
phrase
,
only
abounding
in
her
own
sense
,
but
his
temperate
raptures
*NL*
exerted
a
singular
effect
upon
the
ardor
which
she
herself
had
so
freely
*NL*
manifested
a
few
months
before
.
She
now
seemed
inclined
to
take
a
purely
*NL*
critical
view
of
Madame
de
Cintre
,
and
wished
to
have
it
understood
that
*NL*
she
did
not
in
the
least
answer
for
her
being
a
compendium
of
all
the
*NL*
virtues
.
``
No
woman
was
ever
so
good
as
that
woman
seems
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
Remember
what
Shakespeare
calls
Desdemona
;
'
a
supersubtle
Venetian
.
'
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
is
a
supersubtle
Parisian
.
She
is
a
charming
woman
,
and
*NL*
she
has
five
hundred
merits
;
but
you
had
better
keep
that
in
mind
.
''
Was
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
simply
finding
out
that
she
was
jealous
of
her
dear
friend
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
Seine
,
and
that
in
undertaking
to
provide
*NL*
Newman
with
an
ideal
wife
she
had
counted
too
much
on
her
own
*NL*
disinterestedness
?
We
may
be
permitted
to
doubt
it
.
The
inconsistent
*NL*
little
lady
of
the
Avenue
d'Iena
had
an
insuperable
need
of
changing
*NL*
her
place
,
intellectually
.
She
had
a
lively
imagination
,
and
she
was
*NL*
capable
,
at
certain
times
,
of
imagining
the
direct
reverse
of
her
*NL*
most
cherished
beliefs
,
with
a
vividness
more
intense
than
that
of
*NL*
conviction
.
She
got
tired
of
thinking
aright
;
but
there
was
no
serious
*NL*
harm
in
it
,
as
she
got
equally
tired
of
thinking
wrong
.
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
her
mysterious
perversities
she
had
admirable
flashes
of
justice
.
One
*NL*
of
these
occurred
when
Newman
related
to
her
that
he
had
made
a
formal
*NL*
proposal
to
Madame
de
Cintre
.
He
repeated
in
a
few
words
what
he
had
*NL*
said
,
and
in
a
great
many
what
she
had
answered
.
Mrs.
Tristram
listened
*NL*
with
extreme
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
there
is
nothing
to
congratulate
me
upon
.
*NL*
It
is
not
a
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
;
``
it
is
a
great
triumph
.
It
is
*NL*
a
great
triumph
that
she
did
not
silence
you
at
the
first
word
,
and
*NL*
request
you
never
to
speak
to
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
,
''
observed
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
do
n't
;
Heaven
forbid
you
should
!
When
I
told
you
to
go
on
*NL*
your
own
way
and
do
what
came
into
your
head
,
I
had
no
idea
you
would
go
*NL*
over
the
ground
so
fast
.
I
never
dreamed
you
would
offer
yourself
after
*NL*
five
or
six
morning-calls
.
As
yet
,
what
had
you
done
to
make
her
like
*NL*
you
?
You
had
simply
sat
--
not
very
straight
--
and
stared
at
her
.
But
she
*NL*
does
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
remains
to
be
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
is
proved
.
What
will
come
of
it
remains
to
be
seen
.
That
you
*NL*
should
propose
to
marry
her
,
without
more
ado
,
could
never
have
come
*NL*
into
her
head
.
You
can
form
very
little
idea
of
what
passed
through
her
*NL*
mind
as
you
spoke
;
if
she
ever
really
marries
you
,
the
affair
will
be
*NL*
characterized
by
the
usual
justice
of
all
human
beings
towards
women
.
*NL*
You
will
think
you
take
generous
views
of
her
;
but
you
will
never
begin
*NL*
to
know
through
what
a
strange
sea
of
feeling
she
passed
before
she
*NL*
accepted
you
.
As
she
stood
there
in
front
of
you
the
other
day
,
she
*NL*
plunged
into
it
.
She
said
`
Why
not
?
'
to
something
which
,
a
few
hours
*NL*
earlier
,
had
been
inconceivable
.
She
turned
about
on
a
thousand
gathered
*NL*
prejudices
and
traditions
as
on
a
pivot
,
and
looked
where
she
had
never
*NL*
looked
hitherto
.
When
I
think
of
it
--
when
I
think
of
Claire
de
Cintre
*NL*
and
all
that
she
represents
,
there
seems
to
me
something
very
fine
in
*NL*
it
.
When
I
recommended
you
to
try
your
fortune
with
her
I
of
course
*NL*
thought
well
of
you
,
and
in
spite
of
your
sins
I
think
so
still
.
But
I
*NL*
confess
I
do
n't
see
quite
what
you
are
and
what
you
have
done
,
to
make
*NL*
such
a
woman
do
this
sort
of
thing
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
something
very
fine
in
it
!
''
said
Newman
with
a
laugh
,
*NL*
repeating
her
words
.
He
took
an
extreme
satisfaction
in
hearing
that
*NL*
there
was
something
fine
in
it
.
He
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
it
*NL*
himself
,
but
he
had
already
begun
to
value
the
world
's
admiration
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
,
as
adding
to
the
prospective
glory
of
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
immediately
after
this
conversation
that
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
came
to
conduct
his
friend
to
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
to
present
him
to
*NL*
the
other
members
of
his
family
.
``
You
are
already
introduced
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
and
you
have
begun
to
be
talked
about
.
My
sister
has
mentioned
your
*NL*
successive
visits
to
my
mother
,
and
it
was
an
accident
that
my
mother
*NL*
was
present
at
none
of
them
.
I
have
spoken
of
you
as
an
American
of
*NL*
immense
wealth
,
and
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
,
who
is
looking
for
*NL*
something
very
superior
in
the
way
of
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
,
''
asked
Newman
,
``
that
Madame
de
Cintre
has
related
to
*NL*
your
mother
the
last
conversation
I
had
with
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
certain
that
she
has
not
;
she
will
keep
her
own
counsel
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
you
must
make
your
way
with
the
rest
of
the
family
.
Thus
much
*NL*
is
known
about
you
:
you
have
made
a
great
fortune
in
trade
,
you
are
*NL*
a
little
eccentric
,
and
you
frankly
admire
our
dear
Claire
.
My
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
whom
you
remember
seeing
in
Madame
de
Cintre
's
*NL*
sitting-room
,
took
,
it
appears
,
a
fancy
to
you
;
she
has
described
you
as
*NL*
having
beaucoup
de
cachet
.
My
mother
,
therefore
,
is
curious
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
expects
to
laugh
at
me
,
eh
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
laughs
.
If
she
does
not
like
you
,
do
n't
hope
to
purchase
*NL*
favor
by
being
amusing
.
Take
warning
by
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
took
place
in
the
evening
,
and
half
an
hour
later
*NL*
Valentin
ushered
his
companion
into
an
apartment
of
the
house
of
the
Rue
*NL*
de
l'Universite
into
which
he
had
not
yet
penetrated
,
the
salon
of
the
*NL*
dowager
Marquise
de
Bellegarde
.
It
was
a
vast
,
high
room
,
with
elaborate
*NL*
and
ponderous
mouldings
,
painted
a
whitish
gray
,
along
the
upper
portion
*NL*
of
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
;
with
a
great
deal
of
faded
and
carefully
*NL*
repaired
tapestry
in
the
doorways
and
chair-backs
;
a
Turkey
carpet
in
*NL*
light
colors
,
still
soft
and
deep
,
in
spite
of
great
antiquity
,
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
portraits
of
each
of
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
children
,
at
the
*NL*
age
of
ten
,
suspended
against
an
old
screen
of
red
silk
.
The
room
was
*NL*
illumined
,
exactly
enough
for
conversation
,
by
half
a
dozen
candles
,
*NL*
placed
in
odd
corners
,
at
a
great
distance
apart
.
In
a
deep
armchair
,
*NL*
near
the
fire
,
sat
an
old
lady
in
black
;
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
*NL*
another
person
was
seated
at
the
piano
,
playing
a
very
expressive
*NL*
waltz
.
In
this
latter
person
Newman
recognized
the
young
Marquise
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
presented
his
friend
,
and
Newman
walked
up
to
the
old
lady
by
*NL*
the
fire
and
shook
hands
with
her
.
He
received
a
rapid
impression
of
a
*NL*
white
,
delicate
,
aged
face
,
with
a
high
forehead
,
a
small
mouth
,
and
a
*NL*
pair
of
cold
blue
eyes
which
had
kept
much
of
the
freshness
of
youth
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
looked
hard
at
him
,
and
returned
his
hand-shake
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
British
positiveness
which
reminded
him
that
she
was
*NL*
the
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
St.
Dunstan
's
.
Her
daughter-in-law
stopped
*NL*
playing
and
gave
him
an
agreeable
smile
.
Newman
sat
down
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
,
while
Valentin
went
and
kissed
the
hand
of
the
young
*NL*
marquise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
seen
you
before
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
You
have
*NL*
paid
several
visits
to
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Newman
,
smiling
;
``
Madame
de
Cintre
and
I
are
old
friends
*NL*
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
gone
fast
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
fast
as
I
should
like
,
''
said
Newman
,
bravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
very
ambitious
,
''
answered
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
confess
I
am
,
''
said
Newman
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
looked
at
him
with
her
cold
fine
eyes
,
and
he
*NL*
returned
her
gaze
,
reflecting
that
she
was
a
possible
adversary
and
*NL*
trying
to
take
her
measure
.
Their
eyes
remained
in
contact
for
some
*NL*
moments
.
Then
Madame
de
Bellegarde
looked
away
,
and
without
smiling
,
``
I
*NL*
am
very
ambitious
,
too
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
felt
that
taking
her
measure
was
not
easy
;
she
was
a
formidable
,
*NL*
inscrutable
little
woman
.
She
resembled
her
daughter
,
and
yet
she
was
*NL*
utterly
unlike
her
.
The
coloring
in
Madame
de
Cintre
was
the
same
,
and
*NL*
the
high
delicacy
of
her
brow
and
nose
was
hereditary
.
But
her
face
was
*NL*
a
larger
and
freer
copy
,
and
her
mouth
in
especial
a
happy
divergence
*NL*
from
that
conservative
orifice
,
a
little
pair
of
lips
at
once
plump
and
*NL*
pinched
,
that
looked
,
when
closed
,
as
if
they
could
not
open
wider
than
*NL*
to
swallow
a
gooseberry
or
to
emit
an
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
''
which
probably
had
*NL*
been
thought
to
give
the
finishing
touch
to
the
aristocratic
prettiness
*NL*
of
the
Lady
Emmeline
Atheling
as
represented
,
forty
years
before
,
in
*NL*
several
Books
of
Beauty
.
Madame
de
Cintre
's
face
had
,
to
Newman
's
eye
,
*NL*
a
range
of
expression
as
delightfully
vast
as
the
wind-streaked
,
*NL*
cloud-flecked
distance
on
a
Western
prairie
.
But
her
mother
's
white
,
*NL*
intense
,
respectable
countenance
,
with
its
formal
gaze
,
and
its
*NL*
circumscribed
smile
,
suggested
a
document
signed
and
sealed
;
a
thing
*NL*
of
parchment
,
ink
,
and
ruled
lines
.
``
She
is
a
woman
of
conventions
and
*NL*
proprieties
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
her
;
``
her
world
is
the
*NL*
world
of
things
immutably
decreed
.
But
how
she
is
at
home
in
it
,
and
*NL*
what
a
paradise
she
finds
it
.
She
walks
about
in
it
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
blooming
park
,
a
Garden
of
Eden
;
and
when
she
sees
`
This
is
genteel
,
'
or
*NL*
`
This
is
improper
,
'
written
on
a
mile-stone
she
stops
ecstatically
,
as
*NL*
if
she
were
listening
to
a
nightingale
or
smelling
a
rose
.
''
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
wore
a
little
black
velvet
hood
tied
under
her
chin
,
and
she
*NL*
was
wrapped
in
an
old
black
cashmere
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
American
?
''
she
said
presently
.
``
I
have
seen
several
*NL*
Americans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
several
in
Paris
,
''
said
Newman
jocosely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
?
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
It
was
in
England
I
saw
*NL*
these
,
or
somewhere
else
;
not
in
Paris
.
I
think
it
must
have
been
in
the
*NL*
Pyrenees
,
many
years
ago
.
I
am
told
your
ladies
are
very
pretty
.
One
of
*NL*
these
ladies
was
very
pretty
!
such
a
wonderful
complexion
!
She
presented
*NL*
me
a
note
of
introduction
from
some
one
--
I
forgot
whom
--
and
she
sent
*NL*
with
it
a
note
of
her
own
.
I
kept
her
letter
a
long
time
afterwards
,
it
*NL*
was
so
strangely
expressed
.
I
used
to
know
some
of
the
phrases
by
heart
.
*NL*
But
I
have
forgotten
them
now
,
it
is
so
many
years
ago
.
Since
then
I
*NL*
have
seen
no
more
Americans
.
I
think
my
daughter-in-law
has
;
she
is
a
*NL*
great
gad-about
,
she
sees
every
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
younger
lady
came
rustling
forward
,
pinching
in
a
very
*NL*
slender
waist
,
and
casting
idly
preoccupied
glances
over
the
front
*NL*
of
her
dress
,
which
was
apparently
designed
for
a
ball
.
She
was
,
in
a
*NL*
singular
way
,
at
once
ugly
and
pretty
;
she
had
protuberant
eyes
,
and
*NL*
lips
strangely
red
.
She
reminded
Newman
of
his
friend
,
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
;
this
was
what
that
much-obstructed
young
lady
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
be
.
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
walked
behind
her
at
a
distance
,
hopping
*NL*
about
to
keep
off
the
far-spreading
train
of
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
show
more
of
your
shoulders
behind
,
''
he
said
very
gravely
.
*NL*
``
You
might
as
well
wear
a
standing
ruff
as
such
a
dress
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
turned
her
back
to
the
mirror
over
the
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
and
glanced
behind
her
,
to
verify
Valentin
's
assertion
.
The
mirror
*NL*
descended
low
,
and
yet
it
reflected
nothing
but
a
large
unclad
flesh
*NL*
surface
.
The
young
marquise
put
her
hands
behind
her
and
gave
a
downward
*NL*
pull
to
the
waist
of
her
dress
.
``
Like
that
,
you
mean
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
little
better
,
''
said
Bellegarde
in
the
same
tone
,
``
but
it
*NL*
leaves
a
good
deal
to
be
desired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
never
go
to
extremes
,
''
said
his
sister-in-law
.
And
then
,
turning
*NL*
to
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
What
were
you
calling
me
just
now
,
madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
called
you
a
gad-about
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
``
But
I
might
call
you
*NL*
something
else
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gad-about
?
What
an
ugly
word
!
What
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
beautiful
person
,
''
Newman
ventured
to
say
,
seeing
that
it
was
in
*NL*
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
pretty
compliment
but
a
bad
translation
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
marquise
.
And
then
,
looking
at
him
a
moment
,
``
Do
you
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
wrong
,
''
she
said
,
simply
.
And
with
another
look
at
her
*NL*
back
in
the
mirror
she
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
Paris
?
''
asked
the
old
lady
,
who
was
apparently
wondering
*NL*
what
was
the
proper
way
to
talk
to
an
American
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
rather
,
''
said
Newman
.
And
then
he
added
with
a
friendly
*NL*
intonation
,
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
I
know
it
.
I
know
my
house
--
I
know
my
friends
--
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
lose
a
great
deal
,
''
said
Newman
,
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
stared
;
it
was
presumably
the
first
time
she
had
*NL*
been
condoled
with
on
her
losses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
content
with
what
I
have
,
''
she
said
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
's
eyes
,
at
this
moment
,
were
wandering
round
the
room
,
which
*NL*
struck
him
as
rather
sad
and
shabby
;
passing
from
the
high
casements
,
*NL*
with
their
small
,
thickly-framed
panes
,
to
the
sallow
tints
of
two
or
*NL*
three
portraits
in
pastel
,
of
the
last
century
,
which
hung
between
*NL*
them
.
He
ought
,
obviously
,
to
have
answered
that
the
contentment
of
his
*NL*
hostess
was
quite
natural
--
she
had
a
great
deal
;
but
the
idea
did
not
*NL*
occur
to
him
during
the
pause
of
some
moments
which
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
mother
,
''
said
Valentin
,
coming
and
leaning
against
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
``
what
do
you
think
of
my
dear
friend
Newman
?
Is
he
not
*NL*
the
excellent
fellow
I
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
acquaintance
with
Mr.
Newman
has
not
gone
very
far
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
``
I
can
as
yet
only
appreciate
his
great
politeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
is
a
great
judge
of
these
matters
,
''
said
Valentin
to
Newman
.
*NL*
``
If
you
have
satisfied
her
,
it
is
a
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
satisfy
you
,
some
day
,
''
said
Newman
,
looking
at
the
old
*NL*
lady
.
``
I
have
done
nothing
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
listen
to
my
son
;
he
will
bring
you
into
trouble
.
He
is
a
*NL*
sad
scatterbrain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
him
--
I
like
him
,
''
said
Newman
,
genially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
amuses
you
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
that
,
Valentin
?
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
You
amuse
Mr.
*NL*
Newman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
we
shall
all
come
to
that
!
''
Valentin
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
see
my
other
son
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
He
is
much
*NL*
better
than
this
one
.
But
he
will
not
amuse
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
know
!
''
murmured
Valentin
,
reflectively
.
``
But
we
*NL*
shall
very
soon
see
.
Here
comes
Monsieur
mon
frere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
had
just
opened
to
give
ingress
to
a
gentleman
who
stepped
*NL*
forward
and
whose
face
Newman
remembered
.
He
had
been
the
author
of
our
*NL*
hero
's
discomfiture
the
first
time
he
tried
to
present
himself
to
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
.
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
went
to
meet
his
brother
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
a
moment
,
and
then
,
taking
him
by
the
arm
,
led
him
up
to
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
excellent
friend
Mr.
Newman
,
''
he
said
very
blandly
.
``
You
*NL*
must
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
to
know
Mr.
Newman
,
''
said
the
marquis
with
a
low
bow
,
*NL*
but
without
offering
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
old
woman
at
second-hand
,
''
Newman
said
to
himself
,
as
he
*NL*
returned
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
greeting
.
And
this
was
the
starting-point
of
*NL*
a
speculative
theory
,
in
his
mind
,
that
the
late
marquis
had
been
a
very
*NL*
amiable
foreigner
,
with
an
inclination
to
take
life
easily
and
a
sense
*NL*
that
it
was
difficult
for
the
husband
of
the
stilted
little
lady
by
the
*NL*
fire
to
do
so
.
But
if
he
had
taken
little
comfort
in
his
wife
he
had
*NL*
taken
much
in
his
two
younger
children
,
who
were
after
his
own
heart
,
*NL*
while
Madame
de
Bellegarde
had
paired
with
her
eldest-born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
has
spoken
to
me
of
you
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
;
``
and
as
*NL*
you
are
also
acquainted
with
my
sister
,
it
was
time
we
should
meet
.
''
He
*NL*
turned
to
his
mother
and
gallantly
bent
over
her
hand
,
touching
it
with
*NL*
his
lips
,
and
then
he
assumed
an
attitude
before
the
chimney-piece
.
With
*NL*
his
long
,
lean
face
,
his
high-bridged
nose
and
his
small
,
opaque
eye
he
*NL*
looked
much
like
an
Englishman
.
His
whiskers
were
fair
and
glossy
,
and
*NL*
he
had
a
large
dimple
,
of
unmistakably
British
origin
,
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
his
handsome
chin
.
He
was
``
distinguished
''
to
the
tips
of
his
polished
*NL*
nails
,
and
there
was
not
a
movement
of
his
fine
,
perpendicular
person
*NL*
that
was
not
noble
and
majestic
.
Newman
had
never
yet
been
confronted
*NL*
with
such
an
incarnation
of
the
art
of
taking
one
's
self
seriously
;
he
*NL*
felt
a
sort
of
impulse
to
step
backward
,
as
you
do
to
get
a
view
of
a
*NL*
great
facade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Urbain
,
''
said
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
who
had
apparently
been
*NL*
waiting
for
her
husband
to
take
her
to
her
ball
,
``
I
call
your
attention
*NL*
to
the
fact
that
I
am
dressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
good
idea
,
''
murmured
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
orders
,
my
dear
friend
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
``
Only
,
*NL*
you
must
allow
me
first
the
pleasure
of
a
little
conversation
with
Mr.
*NL*
Newman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
are
going
to
a
party
,
do
n't
let
me
keep
you
,
''
objected
*NL*
Newman
.
``
I
am
very
sure
we
shall
meet
again
.
Indeed
,
if
you
would
like
*NL*
to
converse
with
me
I
will
gladly
name
an
hour
.
''
He
was
eager
to
make
*NL*
it
known
that
he
would
readily
answer
all
questions
and
satisfy
all
*NL*
exactions
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
stood
in
a
well-balanced
position
before
the
fire
,
*NL*
caressing
one
of
his
fair
whiskers
with
one
of
his
white
hands
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
Newman
,
half
askance
,
with
eyes
from
which
a
particular
ray
*NL*
of
observation
made
its
way
through
a
general
meaningless
smile
.
``
It
is
*NL*
very
kind
of
you
to
make
such
an
offer
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
*NL*
your
occupations
are
such
as
to
make
your
time
precious
.
You
are
*NL*
in
--
a
--
as
we
say
,
dans
les
affaires
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
business
,
you
mean
?
Oh
no
,
I
have
thrown
business
overboard
for
the
*NL*
present
.
I
am
`
loafing
,
'
as
WE
say
.
My
time
is
quite
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
are
taking
a
holiday
,
''
rejoined
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
''
`
Loafing
.
'
*NL*
Yes
,
I
have
heard
that
expression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Newman
is
American
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
is
a
great
ethnologist
,
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
ethnologist
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
Ah
,
you
collect
negroes
'
skulls
,
and
*NL*
that
sort
of
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
looked
hard
at
his
brother
,
and
began
to
caress
his
other
*NL*
whisker
.
Then
,
turning
to
Newman
,
with
sustained
urbanity
,
``
You
are
*NL*
traveling
for
your
pleasure
?
''
he
asked
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
knocking
about
to
pick
up
one
thing
and
another
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
get
a
good
deal
of
pleasure
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
especially
interests
you
?
''
inquired
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
everything
interests
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
am
not
particular
.
*NL*
Manufactures
are
what
I
care
most
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
been
your
specialty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
I
have
any
specialty
.
My
specialty
has
been
to
make
the
*NL*
largest
possible
fortune
in
the
shortest
possible
time
.
''
Newman
made
*NL*
this
last
remark
very
deliberately
;
he
wished
to
open
the
way
,
if
it
*NL*
were
necessary
,
to
an
authoritative
statement
of
his
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
laughed
agreeably
.
``
I
hope
you
have
succeeded
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
made
a
fortune
in
a
reasonable
time
.
I
am
not
so
old
,
you
*NL*
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paris
is
a
very
good
place
to
spend
a
fortune
.
I
wish
you
great
*NL*
enjoyment
of
yours
.
''
And
M.
de
Bellegarde
drew
forth
his
gloves
and
*NL*
began
to
put
them
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
for
a
few
moments
watched
him
sliding
his
white
hands
into
the
*NL*
white
kid
,
and
as
he
did
so
his
feelings
took
a
singular
turn
.
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
's
good
wishes
seemed
to
descend
out
of
the
white
expanse
of
*NL*
his
sublime
serenity
with
the
soft
,
scattered
movement
of
a
shower
of
*NL*
snow-flakes
.
Yet
Newman
was
not
irritated
;
he
did
not
feel
that
he
was
*NL*
being
patronized
;
he
was
conscious
of
no
especial
impulse
to
introduce
*NL*
a
discord
into
so
noble
a
harmony
.
Only
he
felt
himself
suddenly
in
*NL*
personal
contact
with
the
forces
with
which
his
friend
Valentin
had
*NL*
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
contend
,
and
he
became
sensible
of
their
*NL*
intensity
.
He
wished
to
make
some
answering
manifestation
,
to
stretch
*NL*
himself
out
at
his
own
length
,
to
sound
a
note
at
the
uttermost
end
*NL*
of
HIS
scale
.
It
must
be
added
that
if
this
impulse
was
not
vicious
or
*NL*
malicious
,
it
was
by
no
means
void
of
humorous
expectancy
.
Newman
was
*NL*
quite
as
ready
to
give
play
to
that
loosely-adjusted
smile
of
his
,
if
*NL*
his
hosts
should
happen
to
be
shocked
,
as
he
was
far
from
deliberately
*NL*
planning
to
shock
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paris
is
a
very
good
place
for
idle
people
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
it
is
a
very
*NL*
good
place
if
your
family
has
been
settled
here
for
a
long
time
,
and
you
*NL*
have
made
acquaintances
and
got
your
relations
round
you
;
or
if
you
have
*NL*
got
a
good
big
house
like
this
,
and
a
wife
and
children
and
mother
and
*NL*
sister
,
and
everything
comfortable
.
I
do
n't
like
that
way
of
living
all
*NL*
in
rooms
next
door
to
each
other
.
But
I
am
not
an
idler
.
I
try
to
be
,
*NL*
but
I
ca
n't
manage
it
;
it
goes
against
the
grain
.
My
business
habits
are
*NL*
too
deep-seated
.
Then
,
I
have
n't
any
house
to
call
my
own
,
or
anything
*NL*
in
the
way
of
a
family
.
My
sisters
are
five
thousand
miles
away
,
my
*NL*
mother
died
when
I
was
a
youngster
,
and
I
have
n't
any
wife
;
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
!
So
,
you
see
,
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
myself
.
I
am
not
*NL*
fond
of
books
,
as
you
are
,
sir
,
and
I
get
tired
of
dining
out
and
going
*NL*
to
the
opera
.
I
miss
my
business
activity
.
You
see
,
I
began
to
earn
my
*NL*
living
when
I
was
almost
a
baby
,
and
until
a
few
months
ago
I
have
never
*NL*
had
my
hand
off
the
plow
.
Elegant
leisure
comes
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
was
followed
by
a
profound
silence
of
some
moments
,
on
the
*NL*
part
of
Newman
's
entertainers
.
Valentin
stood
looking
at
him
fixedly
,
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
then
he
slowly
,
with
a
half-sidling
*NL*
motion
,
went
out
of
the
door
.
The
marquis
continued
to
draw
on
his
*NL*
gloves
and
to
smile
benignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
began
to
earn
your
living
when
you
were
a
mere
baby
?
''
said
the
*NL*
marquise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
more

a
small
boy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
you
are
not
fond
of
books
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
;
``
but
*NL*
you
must
do
yourself
the
justice
to
remember
that
your
studies
were
*NL*
interrupted
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
true
;
on
my
tenth
birthday
I
stopped
going
to
school
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
was
a
grand
way
to
keep
it
.
But
I
picked
up
some
information
*NL*
afterwards
,
''
said
Newman
,
reassuringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
some
sisters
?

asked
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

two
sisters

Splendid

*NL*
*NL*

commenced
less
early

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
married
very
early

you
call
that
a

our

One
of
them

married

the
owner

the
largest
*NL*
india-rubber
house
in
the
West

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

make
houses
also

inquired
the
marquise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
stretch
them

increases

said
young
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
who
was
muffling
herself
in
a
long
white
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
indulged
in
a
burst
of
hilarity
,
and
explained
that
the
house
in
*NL*
which
his
brother-in-law
lived
was
a
large
wooden
structure
,
but
that
he
*NL*
manufactured
and
sold
india-rubber
on
a
colossal
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
children
have
some
little
india-rubber
shoes
which
they
put
on
*NL*
when
they
go
to
play
in
the
Tuileries
in
damp
weather
,
''
said
the
young
*NL*
marquise
.
``
I
wonder
whether
your
brother-in-law
made
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
if
he
did
,
you
may
be
very
sure
they
are
*NL*
well
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
not
be
discouraged
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
with
vague
*NL*
urbanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
.
I
have
a
project
which
gives
me
plenty
to
think
*NL*
about
,
and
that
is
an
occupation
.
''
And
then
Newman
was
silent
a
moment
,
*NL*
hesitating
,
yet
thinking
rapidly
;
he
wished
to
make
his
point
,
and
yet
*NL*
to
do
so
forced
him
to
speak
out
in
a
way
that
was
disagreeable
to
*NL*
him
.
Nevertheless
he
continued
,
addressing
himself
to
old
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
``
I
will
tell
you
my
project
;
perhaps
you
can
help
me
.
I
want
*NL*
to
take
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
good
project
,
but
I
am
no
matchmaker
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
her
an
instant
,
and
then
,
with
perfect
sincerity
,
``
I
*NL*
should
have
thought
you
were
,
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
appeared
to
think
him
too
sincere
.
She
murmured
*NL*
something
sharply
in
French
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
her
son
.
At
this
*NL*
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
,
and
with
a
rapid
step
*NL*
Valentin
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
message
for
you
,
''
he
said
to
his
sister-in-law
.
``
Claire
bids
*NL*
me
to
request
you
not
to
start
for
your
ball
.
She
will
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Claire
will
go
with
us
!
''
cried
the
young
marquise
.
``
En
voila
,
du
*NL*
nouveau
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
changed
her
mind
;
she
decided
half
an
hour
ago
,
and
she
is
*NL*
sticking
the
last
diamond
into
her
hair
,
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
taken
possession
of
my
daughter
?
''
demanded
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
sternly
.
``
She
has
not
been
into
the
world
these
three
*NL*
years
.
Does
she
take
such
a
step
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
,
and
without
*NL*
consulting
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
consulted
me
,
dear
mother
,
five
minutes
since
,
''
said
Valentin
,
*NL*
``
and
I
told
her
that
such
a
beautiful
woman
--
she
is
beautiful
,
you
will
*NL*
see
--
had
no
right
to
bury
herself
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
referred
Claire
to
her
mother
,
my
brother
,
''
said
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
in
French
.
``
This
is
very
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
refer
her
to
the
whole
company
!
''
said
Valentin
.
``
Here
she
comes
!
''
And
*NL*
he
went
to
the
open
door
,
met
Madame
de
Cintre
on
the
threshold
,
took
*NL*
her
by
the
hand
,
and
led
her
into
the
room
.
She
was
dressed
in
white
;
*NL*
but
a
long
blue
cloak
,
which
hung
almost
to
her
feet
,
was
fastened
*NL*
across
her
shoulders
by
a
silver
clasp
.
She
had
tossed
it
back
,
however
,
*NL*
and
her
long
white
arms
were
uncovered
.
In
her
dense
,
fair
hair
there
*NL*
glittered
a
dozen
diamonds
.
She
looked
serious
and
,
Newman
thought
,
*NL*
rather
pale
;
but
she
glanced
round
her
,
and
,
when
she
saw
him
,
smiled
*NL*
and
put
out
her
hand
.
He
thought
her
tremendously
handsome
.
He
had
a
*NL*
chance
to
look
at
her
full
in
the
face
,
for
she
stood
a
moment
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
room
,
hesitating
,
apparently
,
what
she
should
do
,
without
*NL*
meeting
his
eyes
.
Then
she
went
up
to
her
mother
,
who
sat
in
her
deep
*NL*
chair
by
the
fire
,
looking
at
Madame
de
Cintre
almost
fiercely
.
With
her
*NL*
back
turned
to
the
others
,
Madame
de
Cintre
held
her
cloak
apart
to
show
*NL*
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
me
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
audacious
,
''
said
the
marquise
.
``
It
was
but
three
days
*NL*
ago
,
when
I
asked
you
,
as
a
particular
favor
to
myself
,
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Duchess
de
Lusignan
's
,
that
you
told
me
you
were
going
nowhere
and
*NL*
that
one
must
be
consistent
.
Is
this
your
consistency
?
Why
should
you
*NL*
distinguish
Madame
Robineau
?
Who
is
it
you
wish
to
please
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
please
myself
,
dear
mother
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
And
she
*NL*
bent
over
and
kissed
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
surprises
,
my
sister
,
''
said
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
;
*NL*
``
especially
when
one
is
on
the
point
of
entering
a
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
at
this
juncture
felt
inspired
to
speak
.
``
Oh
,
if
you
are
going
*NL*
into
a
room
with
Madame
de
Cintre
,
you
need
n't
be
afraid
of
being
*NL*
noticed
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
turned
to
his
sister
with
a
smile
too
intense
to
be
*NL*
easy
.
``
I
hope
you
appreciate
a
compliment
that
is
paid
you
at
your
*NL*
brother
's
expense
,
''
he
said
.
``
Come
,
come
,
madame
.
''
And
offering
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
his
arm
he
led
her
rapidly
out
of
the
room
.
Valentin
rendered
*NL*
the
same
service
to
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
who
had
apparently
been
*NL*
reflecting
on
the
fact
that
the
ball
dress
of
her
sister-in-law
was
*NL*
much
less
brilliant
than
her
own
,
and
yet
had
failed
to
derive
absolute
*NL*
comfort
from
the
reflection
.
With
a
farewell
smile
she
sought
the
*NL*
complement
of
her
consolation
in
the
eyes
of
the
American
visitor
,
and
*NL*
perceiving
in
them
a
certain
mysterious
brilliancy
,
it
is
not
improbable
*NL*
that
she
may
have
flattered
herself
she
had
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
left
alone
with
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
stood
before
her
a
few
*NL*
moments
in
silence
.
``
Your
daughter
is
very
beautiful
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
strange
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
''
Newman
rejoined
,
smiling
.
``
It
makes
me
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hope
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
she
will
consent
,
some
day
,
to
marry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
slowly
rose
to
her
feet
.
``
That
really
is
your
project
,
*NL*
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
will
you
favor
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Favor
it
?
''
Madame
de
Bellegarde
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
shook
*NL*
her
head
.
``
No
!
''
she
said
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
suffer
it
,
then
?
Will
you
let
it
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
you
ask
.
I
am
a
very
proud
and
meddlesome
old
*NL*
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
very
rich
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
floor
,
and
Newman
thought
*NL*
it
probable
she
was
weighing
the
reasons
in
favor
of
resenting
the
*NL*
brutality
of
this
remark
.
But
at
last
,
looking
up
,
she
said
simply
,
``
How
*NL*
rich
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
expressed
his
income
in
a
round
number
which
had
the
magnificent
*NL*
sound
that
large
aggregations
of
dollars
put
on
when
they
are
translated
*NL*
into
francs
.
He
added
a
few
remarks
of
a
financial
character
,
which
*NL*
completed
a
sufficiently
striking
presentment
of
his
resources
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
listened
in
silence
.
``
You
are
very
frank
,
''
she
said
*NL*
finally
.
``
I
will
be
the
same
.
I
would
rather
favor
you
,
on
the
whole
,
*NL*
than
suffer
you
.
It
will
be
easier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thankful
for
any
terms
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
,
for
the
present
,
you
*NL*
have
suffered
me
long
enough
.
Good
night
!
''
And
he
took
his
leave
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
on
his
return
to
Paris
,
had
not
resumed
the
study
of
French
*NL*
conversation
with
M.
Nioche
;
he
found
that
he
had
too
many
other
uses
*NL*
for
his
time
.
M.
Nioche
,
however
,
came
to
see
him
very
promptly
,
having
*NL*
learned
his
whereabouts
by
a
mysterious
process
to
which
his
patron
*NL*
never
obtained
the
key
.
The
shrunken
little
capitalist
repeated
his
*NL*
visit
more
than
once
.
He
seemed
oppressed
by
a
humiliating
sense
of
*NL*
having
been
overpaid
,
and
wished
apparently
to
redeem
his
debt
by
the
*NL*
offer
of
grammatical
and
statistical
information
in
small
installments
.
*NL*
He
wore
the
same
decently
melancholy
aspect
as
a
few
months
before
;
a
*NL*
few
months
more
or
less
of
brushing
could
make
little
difference
in
the
*NL*
antique
lustre
of
his
coat
and
hat
.
But
the
poor
old
man
's
spirit
was
a
*NL*
trifle
more
threadbare
;
it
seemed
to
have
received
some
hard
rubs
during
*NL*
the
summer
.
Newman
inquired
with
interest
about
Mademoiselle
Noemie
;
*NL*
and
M.
Nioche
,
at
first
,
for
answer
,
simply
looked
at
him
in
lachrymose
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
I
sit
and
watch
her
,
but
I
can
do
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
she
misconducts
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
I
am
sure
.
I
ca
n't
follow
her
.
I
do
n't
understand
her
.
*NL*
She
has
something
in
her
head
;
I
do
n't
know
what
she
is
trying
to
do
.
*NL*
She
is
too
deep
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
continue
to
go
to
the
Louvre
?
Has
she
made
any
of
those
copies
*NL*
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
goes
to
the
Louvre
,
but
I
see
nothing
of
the
copies
.
She
has
*NL*
something
on
her
easel
;
I
suppose
it
is
one
of
the
pictures
you
ordered
.
*NL*
Such
a
magnificent
order
ought
to
give
her
fairy-fingers
.
But
she
is
*NL*
not
in
earnest
.
I
ca
n't
say
anything
to
her
;
I
am
afraid
of
her
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
last
summer
,
when
I
took
her
to
walk
in
the
Champs
Elysees
,
she
*NL*
said
some
things
to
me
that
frightened
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
an
unhappy
father
from
telling
you
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
unfolding
*NL*
his
calico
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
promised
himself
to
pay
Mademoiselle
Noemie
another
visit
at
the
*NL*
Louvre
.
He
was
curious
about
the
progress
of
his
copies
,
but
it
must
*NL*
be
added
that
he
was
still
more
curious
about
the
progress
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
herself
.
He
went
one
afternoon
to
the
great
museum
,
and
wandered
*NL*
through
several
of
the
rooms
in
fruitless
quest
of
her
.
He
was
bending
*NL*
his
steps
to
the
long
hall
of
the
Italian
masters
,
when
suddenly
he
*NL*
found
himself
face
to
face
with
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
.
The
young
*NL*
Frenchman
greeted
him
with
ardor
,
and
assured
him
that
he
was
a
*NL*
godsend
.
He
himself
was
in
the
worst
of
humors
and
he
wanted
some
one
to
*NL*
contradict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
bad
humor
among
all
these
beautiful
things
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
*NL*
thought
you
were
so
fond
of
pictures
,
especially
the
old
black
ones
.
*NL*
There
are
two
or
three
here
that
ought
to
keep
you
in
spirits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
to-day
,
''
answered
Valentin
,
``
I
am
not
in
a
mood
for
pictures
,
and
*NL*
the
more
beautiful
they
are
the
less
I
like
them
.
Their
great
staring
*NL*
eyes
and
fixed
positions
irritate
me
.
I
feel
as
if
I
were
at
some
big
,
*NL*
dull
party
,
in
a
room
full
of
people
I
should
n't
wish
to
speak
to
.
What
*NL*
should
I
care
for
their
beauty
?
It
's
a
bore
,
and
,
worse
still
,
it
's
a
*NL*
reproach
.
I
have
a
great
many
ennuis
;
I
feel
vicious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
Louvre
has
so
little
comfort
for
you
,
why
in
the
world
did
you
*NL*
come
here
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
one
of
my
ennuis
.
I
came
to
meet
my
cousin
--
a
dreadful
English
*NL*
cousin
,
a
member
of
my
mother
's
family
--
who
is
in
Paris
for
a
week
for
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
who
wishes
me
to
point
out
the
`
principal
beauties
.
'
*NL*
Imagine
a
woman
who
wears
a
green
crape
bonnet
in
December
and
has
*NL*
straps
sticking
out
of
the
ankles
of
her
interminable
boots
!
My
mother
*NL*
begged
I
would
do
something
to
oblige
them
.
I
have
undertaken
to
play
*NL*
valet
de
place
this
afternoon
.
They
were
to
have
met
me
here
at
two
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
I
have
been
waiting
for
them
twenty
minutes
.
Why
does
n't
*NL*
she
arrive
?
She
has
at
least
a
pair
of
feet
to
carry
her
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
to
be
furious
at
their
playing
me
false
,
or
delighted
to
have
*NL*
escaped
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
in
your
place
I
would
be
furious
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
because
they
*NL*
may
arrive
yet
,
and
then
your
fury
will
still
be
of
use
to
you
.
Whereas
*NL*
if
you
were
delighted
and
they
were
afterwards
to
turn
up
,
you
might
not
*NL*
know
what
to
do
with
your
delight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give
me
excellent
advice
,
and
I
already
feel
better
.
I
will
be
*NL*
furious
;
I
will
let
them
go
to
the
deuce
and
I
myself
will
go
with
*NL*
you
--
unless
by
chance
you
too
have
a
rendezvous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
exactly
a
rendezvous
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
I
have
in
fact
come
*NL*
to
see
a
person
,
not
a
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
,
presumably
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
I
hope
for
you
with
all
my
heart
that
she
is
not
*NL*
clothed
in
green
tulle
and
that
her
feet
are
not
too
much
out
of
focus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
much
about
her
feet
,
but
she
has
very
pretty
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
gave
a
sigh
.
``
And
on
that
assurance
I
must
part
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
certain
of
finding
my
young
lady
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
and
I
am
not
*NL*
quite
prepared
to
lose
your
company
on
the
chance
.
It
does
not
strike
*NL*
me
as
particularly
desirable
to
introduce
you
to
her
,
and
yet
I
should
*NL*
rather
like
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
will
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bellegarde
passed
his
arm
into
that
of
his
companion
.
``
Conduct
me
to
her
*NL*
on
the
instant
!
I
should
be
ashamed
to
make
a
pretty
woman
wait
for
my
*NL*
verdict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
suffered
himself
to
be
gently
propelled
in
the
direction
in
*NL*
which
he
had
been
walking
,
but
his
step
was
not
rapid
.
He
was
turning
*NL*
something
over
in
his
mind
.
The
two
men
passed
into
the
long
gallery
of
*NL*
the
Italian
masters
,
and
Newman
,
after
having
scanned
for
a
moment
its
*NL*
brilliant
vista
,
turned
aside
into
the
smaller
apartment
devoted
to
*NL*
the
same
school
,
on
the
left
.
It
contained
very
few
persons
,
but
at
the
*NL*
farther
end
of
it
sat
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
before
her
easel
.
She
was
*NL*
not
at
work
;
her
palette
and
brushes
had
been
laid
down
beside
her
,
her
*NL*
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
,
and
she
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
and
*NL*
looking
intently
at
two
ladies
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
,
who
,
with
*NL*
their
backs
turned
to
her
,
had
stopped
before
one
of
the
pictures
.
These
*NL*
ladies
were
apparently
persons
of
high
fashion
;
they
were
dressed
with
*NL*
great
splendor
,
and
their
long
silken
trains
and
furbelows
were
spread
*NL*
over
the
polished
floor
.
It
was
at
their
dresses
Mademoiselle
Noemie
was
*NL*
looking
,
though
what
she
was
thinking
of
I
am
unable
to
say
.
I
hazard
*NL*
the
supposition
that
she
was
saying
to
herself
that
to
be
able
to
drag
*NL*
such
a
train
over
a
polished
floor
was
a
felicity
worth
any
price
.
Her
*NL*
reflections
,
at
any
rate
,
were
disturbed
by
the
advent
of
Newman
and
*NL*
his
companion
.
She
glanced
at
them
quickly
,
and
then
,
coloring
a
little
,
*NL*
rose
and
stood
before
her
easel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
on
purpose
to
see
you
,
''
said
Newman
in
his
bad
French
,
*NL*
offering
to
shake
hands
.
And
then
,
like
a
good
American
,
he
introduced
*NL*
Valentin
formally
:
``
Allow
me
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
Comte
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
made
a
bow
which
must
have
seemed
to
Mademoiselle
Noemie
*NL*
quite
in
harmony
with
the
impressiveness
of
his
title
,
but
the
graceful
*NL*
brevity
of
her
own
response
made
no
concession
to
underbred
surprise
.
*NL*
She
turned
to
Newman
,
putting
up
her
hands
to
her
hair
and
smoothing
its
*NL*
delicately-felt
roughness
.
Then
,
rapidly
,
she
turned
the
canvas
that
was
*NL*
on
her
easel
over
upon
its
face
.
``
You
have
not
forgotten
me
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forget
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
may
be
sure
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
``
there
are
a
great
many
different
ways
*NL*
of
remembering
a
person
.
''
And
she
looked
straight
at
Valentin
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
who
was
looking
at
her
as
a
gentleman
may
when
a
``
verdict
''
*NL*
is
expected
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
painted
anything
for
me
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
Have
you
been
*NL*
industrious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
done
nothing
.
''
And
taking
up
her
palette
,
she
began
to
mix
*NL*
her
colors
at
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
father
tells
me
you
have
come
here
constantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nowhere
else
to
go
!
Here
,
all
summer
,
it
was
cool
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
here
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
you
might
have
tried
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
before
,
''
she
answered
,
softly
,
``
that
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
something
charming
on
your
easel
,
now
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
if
*NL*
you
would
only
let
me
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spread
out
her
two
hands
,
with
the
fingers
expanded
,
over
the
back
*NL*
of
the
canvas
--
those
hands
which
Newman
had
called
pretty
,
and
which
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
several
paint-stains
,
Valentin
could
now
admire
.
``
My
painting
*NL*
is
not
charming
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
only
thing
about
you
that
is
not
,
then
,
mademoiselle
,
''
quoth
*NL*
Valentin
,
gallantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
her
little
canvas
and
silently
passed
it
to
him
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
it
,
and
in
a
moment
she
said
,
``
I
am
sure
you
are
a
judge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
then
,
that
that
is
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
Dieu
,
''
said
Valentin
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
``
let
us
distinguish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
I
ought
not
to
attempt
to
paint
,
''
the
young
girl
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frankly
,
then
,
mademoiselle
,
I
think
you
ought
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
look
at
the
dresses
of
the
two
splendid
ladies
again
--
a
*NL*
point
on
which
,
having
risked
one
conjecture
,
I
think
I
may
risk
*NL*
another
.
While
she
was
looking
at
the
ladies
she
was
seeing
Valentin
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
.
He
,
at
all
events
,
was
seeing
her
.
He
put
down
the
*NL*
roughly-besmeared
canvas
and
addressed
a
little
click
with
his
tongue
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
an
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
,
to
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
all
these
months
?
''
asked
Mademoiselle
Noemie
of
our
*NL*
hero
.
``
You
took
those
great
journeys
,
you
amused
yourself
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
amused
myself
well
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
with
extreme
gentleness
,
and
*NL*
she
began
to
dabble
in
her
colors
again
.
She
was
singularly
pretty
,
with
*NL*
the
look
of
serious
sympathy
that
she
threw
into
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
took
advantage
of
her
downcast
eyes
to
telegraph
again
to
his
*NL*
companion
.
He
renewed
his
mysterious
physiognomical
play
,
making
at
the
*NL*
same
time
a
rapid
tremulous
movement
in
the
air
with
his
fingers
.
He
was
*NL*
evidently
finding
Mademoiselle
Noemie
extremely
interesting
;
the
blue
*NL*
devils
had
departed
,
leaving
the
field
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
something
about
your
travels
,
''
murmured
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
went
to
Switzerland
,
--
to
Geneva
and
Zermatt
and
Zurich
and
all
*NL*
those
places
you
know
;
and
down
to
Venice
,
and
all
through
Germany
,
and
*NL*
down
the
Rhine
,
and
into
Holland
and
Belgium
--
the
regular
round
.
How
do
*NL*
you
say
that
,
in
French
--
the
regular
round
?
''
Newman
asked
of
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
fixed
her
eyes
an
instant
on
Bellegarde
,
and
then
*NL*
with
a
little
smile
,
``
I
do
n't
understand
monsieur
,
''
she
said
,
``
when
he
*NL*
says
so
much
at
once
.
Would
you
be
so
good
as
to
translate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
talk
to
you
out
of
my
own
head
,
''
Valentin
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Newman
,
gravely
,
still
in
his
bad
French
,
``
you
must
not
talk
*NL*
to
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
because
you
say
discouraging
things
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
tell
her
to
work
,
to
persevere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
French
,
mademoiselle
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
are
accused
of
being
*NL*
false
flatterers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
flattery
,
I
want
only
the
truth
.
But
I
know
the
*NL*
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
say
is
that
I
suspect
there
are
some
things
that
you
can
do
*NL*
better
than
paint
,
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
truth
--
I
know
the
truth
,
''
Mademoiselle
Noemie
repeated
.
And
,
*NL*
dipping
a
brush
into
a
clot
of
red
paint
,
she
drew
a
great
horizontal
*NL*
daub
across
her
unfinished
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
answering
,
she
drew
another
long
crimson
daub
,
in
a
vertical
*NL*
direction
,
down
the
middle
of
her
canvas
,
and
so
,
in
a
moment
,
completed
*NL*
the
rough
indication
of
a
cross
.
``
It
is
the
sign
of
the
truth
,
''
she
said
*NL*
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
looked
at
each
other
,
and
Valentin
indulged
in
another
*NL*
flash
of
physiognomical
eloquence
.
``
You
have
spoiled
your
picture
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
very
well
.
It
was
the
only
thing
to
do
with
it
.
I
had
sat
*NL*
looking
at
it
all
day
without
touching
it
.
I
had
begun
to
hate
it
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
me
something
was
going
to
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
better
that
way
than
as
it
was
before
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
Now
*NL*
it
is
more
interesting
.
It
tells
a
story
.
Is
it
for
sale
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
I
have
is
for
sale
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
is
this
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
thousand
francs
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
without
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
that
Mademoiselle
Nioche
may
do
at
present
is
mine
in
*NL*
advance
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
makes
part
of
an
order
I
gave
her
some
months
*NL*
ago
.
So
you
ca
n't
have
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
will
lose
nothing
by
it
,
''
said
the
young
girl
,
looking
at
*NL*
Valentin
.
And
she
began
to
put
up
her
utensils
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
gained
a
charming
memory
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
You
are
going
*NL*
away
?
your
day
is
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
is
coming
to
fetch
me
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
hardly
spoken
when
,
through
the
door
behind
her
,
which
opens
on
*NL*
one
of
the
great
white
stone
staircases
of
the
Louvre
,
M.
Nioche
made
*NL*
his
appearance
.
He
came
in
with
his
usual
even
,
patient
shuffle
,
and
*NL*
he
made
a
low
salute
to
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
standing
before
his
*NL*
daughter
's
easel
.
Newman
shook
his
hands
with
muscular
friendliness
,
and
*NL*
Valentin
returned
his
greeting
with
extreme
deference
.
While
the
old
man
*NL*
stood
waiting
for
Noemie
to
make
a
parcel
of
her
implements
,
he
let
*NL*
his
mild
,
oblique
gaze
hover
toward
Bellegarde
,
who
was
watching
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
put
on
her
bonnet
and
mantle
.
Valentin
was
at
no
*NL*
pains
to
disguise
his
scrutiny
.
He
looked
at
a
pretty
girl
as
he
would
*NL*
have
listened
to
a
piece
of
music
.
Attention
,
in
each
case
,
was
simple
*NL*
good
manners
.
M.
Nioche
at
last
took
his
daughter
's
paint-box
in
one
*NL*
hand
and
the
bedaubed
canvas
,
after
giving
it
a
solemn
,
puzzled
stare
,
*NL*
in
the
other
,
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
.
Mademoiselle
Noemie
made
the
*NL*
young
men
the
salute
of
a
duchess
,
and
followed
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
what
do
you
think
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
remarkable
.
Diable
,
diable
,
diable
!
''
repeated
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
reflectively
;
``
she
is
very
remarkable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
she
is
a
sad
little
adventuress
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
little
one
--
a
great
one
.
She
has
the
material
.
''
And
Valentin
*NL*
began
to
walk
away
slowly
,
looking
vaguely
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
,
*NL*
with
a
thoughtful
illumination
in
his
eye
.
Nothing
could
have
appealed
*NL*
to
his
imagination
more
than
the
possible
adventures
of
a
young
lady
*NL*
endowed
with
the
``
material
''
of
Mademoiselle
Nioche
.
``
She
is

*NL*
interesting

''
he
went
on
.
``
She
is
a
beautiful
type

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
beautiful
type
?
What
the
deuce
do
you
mean
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
.
She
is
an
artist
,
--
outside
of
*NL*
her
painting
,
which
obviously
is
execrable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
not
beautiful
.
I
do
n't
even
think
her
very
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
quite
pretty
enough
for
her
purposes
,
and
it
is
a
face
and
*NL*
figure
on
which
everything
tells
.
If
she
were
prettier
she
would
be
less
*NL*
intelligent
,
and
her
intelligence
is
half
of
her
charm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
,
''
asked
Newman
,
who
was
much
amused
at
his
companion
's
*NL*
immediate
philosophization
of
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
``
does
her
*NL*
intelligence
strike
you
as
so
remarkable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
taken
the
measure
of
life
,
and
she
has
determined
to
BE
*NL*
something
--
to
succeed
at
any
cost
.
Her
painting
,
of
course
,
is
a
mere
*NL*
trick
to
gain
time
.
She
is
waiting
for
her
chance
;
she
wishes
to
launch
*NL*
herself
,
and
to
do
it
well
.
She
knows
her
Paris
.
She
is
one
of
fifty
*NL*
thousand
,
so
far
as
the
mere
ambition
goes
;
but
I
am
very
sure
that
*NL*
in
the
way
of
resolution
and
capacity
she
is
a
rarity
.
And
in
one
*NL*
gift
--
perfect
heartlessness
--
I
will
warrant
she
is
unsurpassed
.
She
*NL*
has
not
as
much
heart
as
will
go
on
the
point
of
a
needle
.
That
is
an
*NL*
immense
virtue
.
Yes
,
she
is
one
of
the
celebrities
of
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
help
us
!
''
said
Newman
,
``
how
far
the
artistic
point
of
view
may
*NL*
take
a
man
!
But
in
this
case
I
must
request
that
you
do
n't
let
it
take
*NL*
you
too
far
.
You
have
learned
a
wonderful
deal
about
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Noemie
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour

Let
that
suffice
;
do
n't
follow
up
your
*NL*
researches

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow

''
cried
Bellegarde
with
warmth
,
``
I
hope
I
have
too
good

intrude

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not

The

is
nothing
to
me

In
fact

I
rather

dislike
her

But
I
like
her
poor
old
father

for
his
sake
I
beg
you
*NL*
to
abstain
from
any
attempt
to
verify
your
theories

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
sake
of
that
seedy
old

came
to
fetch
her

*NL*
demanded
Valentin
,
stopping
short
.
And
on
Newman
's
assenting
,
``
Ah
no
,
ah
*NL*
no
,
''
he
went
on
with
a
smile
.
``
You
are
quite
wrong
,
my
dear
fellow
;
you
*NL*
need
n't
mind
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
verily
believe
that
you
are
accusing
the
poor
gentleman
of
being
*NL*
capable
of
rejoicing
in
his
daughter
's
dishonor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Voyons
,
''
said
Valentin
;
``
who
is
he
?
what
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
what
he
looks
like

as
poor
as
a
rat

very
high-toned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
I
noticed
him
perfectly
;
be
sure
I
do
him
justice
.
He
has
*NL*
had
losses
,
des
malheurs
,
as
we
say
.
He
is
very
low-spirited
,
and
his
*NL*
daughter
is
too
much
for
him
.
He
is
the
pink
of
respectability
,
and
he
*NL*
has
sixty
years
of
honesty
on
his
back
.
All
this
I
perfectly
appreciate
.
*NL*
But
I
know
my
fellow-men
and
my
fellow-Parisians
,
and
I
will
make
a
*NL*
bargain
with
you

''
Newman
gave
ear
to
his
bargain
and
he
went
on
.
``
He
*NL*
would
rather
his
daughter
were
a
good
girl
than
a
bad
one
,
but
if
the
*NL*
worst
comes
to
the
worst
,
the
old
man
will
not
do
what
Virginius
did
.
*NL*
Success
justifies
everything
.
If
Mademoiselle
Noemie
makes
a
figure
,
*NL*
her
papa
will
feel
--
well
,
we
will
call
it
relieved
.
And
she
will
make
a
*NL*
figure
.
The
old
gentleman
's
future
is
assured
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
Virginius
did
,
but
M.
Nioche
will
shoot
Miss
Noemie
,
''
*NL*
said
Newman
.
``
After
that
,
I
suppose
his
future
will
be
assured
in
some
*NL*
snug
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
a
cynic
;
I
am
simply
an
observer
,
''
Valentin
rejoined
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Noemie
interests
me
;
she
is
extremely
remarkable
.
If
*NL*
there
is
a
good
reason
,
in
honor
or
decency
,
for
dismissing
her
from
my
*NL*
thoughts
forever
,
I
am
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
.
Your
estimate
of
the
*NL*
papa
's
sensibilities
is
a
good
reason
until
it
is
invalidated
.
I
promise
*NL*
you
not
to
look
at
the
young
girl
again
until
you
tell
me
that
you
have
*NL*
changed
your
mind
about
the
papa
.
When
he
has
given
distinct
proof
of
*NL*
being
a
philosopher
,
you
will
raise
your
interdict
.
Do
you
agree
to
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
to
bribe
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
admit
,
then
,
that
he
is
bribable

No
,
he
would
ask
too
much
,
*NL*
and
it
would
not
be
exactly
fair
.
I
mean
simply
to
wait
.
You
will
*NL*
continue
,
I
suppose
,
to
see
this
interesting
couple
,
and
you
will
give
*NL*
me
the
news
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
if
the
old
man
turns
out
a
humbug
,
you
may
do
what
*NL*
you
please
.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
matter
.
For
the
girl
herself
,
you
*NL*
may
be
at
rest
.
I
do
n't
know
what
harm
she
may
do
to
me
,
but
I
certainly
*NL*
ca
n't
hurt
her
.
It
seems
to
me
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
you
are
very
well
*NL*
matched

You
are
both
hard
cases
,
and
M.
Nioche

I
believe
,
are
*NL*
the
only
virtuous
men
to
be
found
in
Paris

''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
in
punishment
for
his
levity
,
received
*NL*
a
stern
poke
in
the
back
from
a
pointed
instrument
.
Turning
quickly
*NL*
round
he
found
the
weapon
to
be
a
parasol
wielded
by
a
lady
in
green
*NL*
gauze
bonnet
.
Valentin
's
English
cousins
had
been
drifting
about
*NL*
unpiloted
,
and
evidently
deemed
that
they
had
a
grievance
.
Newman
left
*NL*
him
to
their
mercies
,
but
with
a
boundless
faith
in
his
power
to
plead
*NL*
his
cause

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
his
introduction
to
the
family
of
Madame
de
Cintre
,
*NL*
Newman
,
coming
in
toward
evening
,
found
upon
his
table
the
card
of
the
*NL*
Marquis
de
Bellegarde
.
On
the
following
day
he
received
a
note
informing
*NL*
him
that
the
Marquise
de
Bellegarde
would
be
grateful
for
the
honor
of
*NL*
his
company
at
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
,
of
course
,
though
he
had
to
break
another
engagement
to
do
it
.
*NL*
He
was
ushered
into
the
room
in
which
Madame
de
Bellegarde
had
received
*NL*
him
before
,
and
here
he
found
his
venerable
hostess
,
surrounded
by
her
*NL*
entire
family
.
The
room
was
lighted
only
by
the
crackling
fire
,
which
*NL*
illuminated
the
very
small
pink
slippers
of
a
lady
who
,
seated
in
a
low
*NL*
chair
,
was
stretching
out
her
toes
before
it
.
This
lady
was
the
younger
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
Madame
de
Cintre
was
seated
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
room
,
holding
a
little
girl
against
her
knee
,
the
child
of
her
*NL*
brother
Urbain
,
to
whom
she
was
apparently
relating
a
wonderful
story
.
*NL*
Valentin
was
sitting
on
a
puff
,
close
to
his
sister-in-law
,
into
whose
*NL*
ear
he
was
certainly
distilling
the
finest
nonsense
.
The
marquis
was
*NL*
stationed
before
the
fire
,
with
his
head
erect
and
his
hands
behind
him
,
*NL*
in
an
attitude
of
formal
expectancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
stood
up
to
give
Newman
her
greeting
,
and
there
*NL*
was
that
in
the
way
she
did
so
which
seemed
to
measure
narrowly
the
*NL*
extent
of
her
condescension
.
``
We
are
all
alone
,
you
see
,
we
have
asked
*NL*
no
one
else
,
''
she
said
,
austerely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
you
did
n't
;
this
is
much
more
sociable
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
sir
,
''
and
he
offered
his
hand
to
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
was
affable
,
but
in
spite
of
his
dignity
he
was
*NL*
restless
.
He
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
,
he
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
long
windows
,
he
took
up
books
and
laid
them
down
again
.
Young
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
gave
Newman
her
hand
without
moving
and
without
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
think
that
is
coldness
,
''
exclaimed
Valentin
;
``
but
it
is
not
,
it
*NL*
is
warmth
.
It
shows
she
is
treating
you
as
an
intimate
.
Now
she
detests
*NL*
me
,
and
yet
she
is
always
looking
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
wonder
I
detest
you
if
I
am
always
looking
at
you
!
''
cried
the
lady
.
*NL*
``
If
Mr.
Newman
does
not
like
my
way
of
shaking
hands
,
I
will
do
it
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
charming
privilege
was
lost
upon
our
hero
,
who
was
already
*NL*
making
his
way
across
the
room
to
Madame
de
Cintre
.
She
looked
at
him
*NL*
as
she
shook
hands
,
but
she
went
on
with
the
story
she
was
telling
her
*NL*
little
niece
.
She
had
only
two
or
three
phrases
to
add
,
but
they
were
*NL*
apparently
of
great
moment
.
She
deepened
her
voice
,
smiling
as
she
did
*NL*
so
,
and
the
little
girl
gazed
at
her
with
round
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
the
end
the
young
prince
married
the
beautiful
Florabella
,
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
and
carried
her
off
to
live
with
him
in
the
Land
of
*NL*
the
Pink
Sky
.
There
she
was
so
happy
that
she
forgot
all
her
troubles
,
*NL*
and
went
out
to
drive
every
day
of
her
life
in
an
ivory
coach
drawn
by
*NL*
five
hundred
white
mice
.
Poor
Florabella
,
''
she
exclaimed
to
Newman
,
``
had
*NL*
suffered
terribly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
six
months
,
''
said
little
Blanche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
when
the
six
months
were
over
,
she
had
a
plum-cake
as
big
as
*NL*
that
ottoman
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
That
quite
set
her
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
checkered
career
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
Are
you
very
fond
of
children
?
''
*NL*
He
was
certain
that
she
was
,
but
he
wished
to
make
her
say
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
to
talk
with
them
,
''
she
answered
;
``
we
can
talk
with
them
so
much
*NL*
more
seriously
than
with
grown
persons
.
That
is
great
nonsense
that
I
*NL*
have
been
telling
Blanche
,
but
it
is
a
great
deal
more
serious
than
most
*NL*
of
what
we
say
in
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
talk
to
me
,
then
,
as
if
I
were
Blanche
's
age
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
,
laughing
.
``
Were
you
happy
at
your
ball
,
the
other
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ecstatically
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
talking
the
nonsense
that
we
talk
in
society
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
own
fault
if
I
was
not
happy
.
The
ball
was
very
pretty
,
and
*NL*
every
one
very
amiable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
on
your
conscience
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
you
had
annoyed
your
*NL*
mother
and
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
at
him
a
moment
without
answering
.
``
That
is
*NL*
true
,
''
she
replied
at
last
.
``
I
had
undertaken
more
than
I
could
carry
*NL*
out
.
I
have
very
little
courage
;
I
am
not
a
heroine
.
''
She
said
this
with
*NL*
a
certain
soft
emphasis
;
but
then
,
changing
her
tone
,
``
I
could
never
*NL*
have
gone
through
the
sufferings
of
the
beautiful
Florabella
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
not
even
for
her
prospective
rewards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
announced
,
and
Newman
betook
himself
to
the
side
of
the
old
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
The
dining-room
,
at
the
end
of
a
cold
corridor
,
*NL*
was
vast
and
sombre
;
the
dinner
was
simple
and
delicately
excellent
.
*NL*
Newman
wondered
whether
Madame
de
Cintre
had
had
something
to
do
with
*NL*
ordering
the
repast
and
greatly
hoped
she
had
.
Once
seated
at
table
,
*NL*
with
the
various
members
of
the
ancient
house
of
Bellegarde
around
*NL*
him
,
he
asked
himself
the
meaning
of
his
position
.
Was
the
old
lady
*NL*
responding
to
his
advances
?
Did
the
fact
that
he
was
a
solitary
guest
*NL*
augment
his
credit
or
diminish
it
?
Were
they
ashamed
to
show
him
to
*NL*
other
people
,
or
did
they
wish
to
give
him
a
sign
of
sudden
adoption
*NL*
into
their
last
reserve
of
favor
?
Newman
was
on
his
guard
;
he
was
*NL*
watchful
and
conjectural
;
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
vaguely
*NL*
indifferent
.
Whether
they
gave
him
a
long
rope
or
a
short
one
he
was
*NL*
there
now
,
and
Madame
de
Cintre
was
opposite
to
him
.
She
had
a
tall
*NL*
candlestick
on
each
side
of
her
;
she
would
sit
there
for
the
next
hour
,
*NL*
and
that
was
enough
.
The
dinner
was
extremely
solemn
and
measured
;
he
*NL*
wondered
whether
this
was
always
the
state
of
things
in
``
old
families
.
''
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
held
her
head
very
high
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
,
which
*NL*
looked
peculiarly
sharp
in
her
little
,
finely-wrinkled
white
face
,
very
*NL*
intently
upon
the
table-service
.
The
marquis
appeared
to
have
decided
*NL*
that
the
fine
arts
offered
a
safe
subject
of
conversation
,
as
not
*NL*
leading
to
startling
personal
revelations
.
Every
now
and
then
,
having
*NL*
learned
from
Newman
that
he
had
been
through
the
museums
of
Europe
,
he
*NL*
uttered
some
polished
aphorism
upon
the
flesh-tints
of
Rubens
and
the
*NL*
good
taste
of
Sansovino
.
His
manners
seemed
to
indicate
a
fine
,
nervous
*NL*
dread
that
something
disagreeable
might
happen
if
the
atmosphere
were
*NL*
not
purified
by
allusions
of
a
thoroughly
superior
cast
.
``
What
under
*NL*
the
sun
is
the
man
afraid
of
?
''
Newman
asked
himself
.
``
Does
he
think
I
am
*NL*
going
to
offer
to
swap
jack-knives
with
him
?
''
It
was
useless
to
shut
his
*NL*
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
marquis
was
profoundly
disagreeable
to
him
.
*NL*
He
had
never
been
a
man
of
strong
personal
aversions
;
his
nerves
had
not
*NL*
been
at
the
mercy
of
the
mystical
qualities
of
his
neighbors
.
But
here
*NL*
was
a
man
towards
whom
he
was
irresistibly
in
opposition
;
a
man
of
*NL*
forms
and
phrases
and
postures
;
a
man
full
of
possible
impertinences
*NL*
and
treacheries
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
standing
*NL*
bare-footed
on
a
marble
floor
;
and
yet
,
to
gain
his
desire
,
Newman
felt
*NL*
perfectly
able
to
stand
.
He
wondered
what
Madame
de
Cintre
thought
of
*NL*
his
being
accepted
,
if
accepted
it
was
.
There
was
no
judging
from
her
*NL*
face
,
which
expressed
simply
the
desire
to
be
gracious
in
a
manner
which
*NL*
should
require
as
little
explicit
recognition
as
possible
.
Young
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
had
always
the
same
manners
;
she
was
always
preoccupied
,
*NL*
distracted
,
listening
to
everything
and
hearing
nothing
,
looking
at
*NL*
her
dress
,
her
rings
,
her
finger-nails
,
seeming
rather
bored
,
and
yet
*NL*
puzzling
you
to
decide
what
was
her
ideal
of
social
diversion
.
Newman
*NL*
was
enlightened
on
this
point
later
.
Even
Valentin
did
not
quite
seem
*NL*
master
of
his
wits
;
his
vivacity
was
fitful
and
forced
,
yet
Newman
*NL*
observed
that
in
the
lapses
of
his
talk
he
appeared
excited
.
His
eyes
*NL*
had
an
intenser
spark
than
usual
.
The
effect
of
all
this
was
that
*NL*
Newman
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
was
not
himself
;
that
he
*NL*
measured
his
movements
,
and
counted
his
words
,
and
resolved
that
if
the
*NL*
occasion
demanded
that
he
should
appear
to
have
swallowed
a
ramrod
,
he
*NL*
would
meet
the
emergency
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
M.
de
Bellegarde
proposed
to
his
guest
that
they
should
go
*NL*
into
the
smoking-room
,
and
he
led
the
way
toward
a
small
,
somewhat
*NL*
musty
apartment
,
the
walls
of
which
were
ornamented
with
old
hangings
of
*NL*
stamped
leather
and
trophies
of
rusty
arms
.
Newman
refused
a
cigar
,
but
*NL*
he
established
himself
upon
one
of
the
divans
,
while
the
marquis
puffed
*NL*
his
own
weed
before
the
fire-place
,
and
Valentin
sat
looking
through
the
*NL*
light
fumes
of
a
cigarette
from
one
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
keep
quiet
any
longer
,
''
said
Valentin
,
at
last
.
``
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
the
news
and
congratulate
you
.
My
brother
seems
unable
to
come
to
*NL*
the
point
;
he
revolves
around
his
announcement
like
the
priest
around
*NL*
the
altar
.
You
are
accepted
as
a
candidate
for
the
hand
of
our
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentin
,
be
a
little
proper
!
''
murmured
the
marquis
,
with
a
look
of
the
*NL*
most
delicate
irritation
contracting
the
bridge
of
his
high
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
been
a
family
council
,
''
the
young
man
continued
;
``
my
mother
*NL*
and
Urbain
have
put
their
heads
together
,
and
even
my
testimony
has
*NL*
not
been
altogether
excluded
.
My
mother
and
the
marquis
sat
at
a
table
*NL*
covered
with
green
cloth
;
my
sister-in-law
and
I
were
on
a
bench
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
It
was
like
a
committee
at
the
Corps
Legislatif
.
We
were
*NL*
called
up
,
one
after
the
other
,
to
testify
.
We
spoke
of
you
very
*NL*
handsomely
.
Madame
de
Bellegarde
said
that
if
she
had
not
been
told
who
*NL*
you
were
,
she
would
have
taken
you
for
a
duke
--
an
American
duke
,
the
*NL*
Duke
of
California
.
I
said
that
I
could
warrant
you
grateful
for
the
*NL*
smallest
favors
--
modest
,
humble
,
unassuming
.
I
was
sure
that
you
would
*NL*
know
your
own
place
,
always
,
and
never
give
us
occasion
to
remind
you
of
*NL*
certain
differences
.
After
all
,
you
could
n't
help
it
if
you
were
not
*NL*
a
duke
.
There
were
none
in
your
country
;
but
if
there
had
been
,
it
was
*NL*
certain
that
,
smart
and
active
as
you
are
,
you
would
have
got
the
pick
*NL*
of
the
titles
.
At
this
point
I
was
ordered
to
sit
down
,
but
I
think
I
*NL*
made
an
impression
in
your
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
at
his
brother
with
dangerous
coldness
,
and
*NL*
gave
a
smile
as
thin
as
the
edge
of
a
knife
.
Then
he
removed
a
spark
of
*NL*
cigar-ash
from
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
;
he
fixed
his
eyes
for
a
while
on
*NL*
the
cornice
of
the
room
,
and
at
last
he
inserted
one
of
his
white
hands
*NL*
into
the
breast
of
his
waistcoat
.
``
I
must
apologize
to
you
for
the
*NL*
deplorable
levity
of
my
brother
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
must
notify
you
that
*NL*
this
is
probably
not
the
last
time
that
his
want
of
tact
will
cause
you
*NL*
serious
embarrassment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
confess
I
have
no
tact
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
Is
your
embarrassment
*NL*
really
painful
,
Newman
?
The
marquis
will
put
you
right
again
;
his
own
*NL*
touch
is
deliciously
delicate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentin
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
''
the
marquis
continued
,
``
has
never
*NL*
possessed
the
tone
,
the
manner
,
that
belongs
to
a
young
man
in
his
*NL*
position
.
It
has
been
a
great
affliction
to
his
mother
,
who
is
very
fond
*NL*
of
the
old
traditions
.
But
you
must
remember
that
he
speaks
for
no
one
*NL*
but
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
him
,
sir
,
''
said
Newman
,
good-humoredly
.
``
I
know
what
*NL*
he
amounts
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
good
old
times
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
marquises
and
counts
used
*NL*
to
have
their
appointed
fools
and
jesters
,
to
crack
jokes
for
them
.
*NL*
Nowadays
we
see
a
great
strapping
democrat
keeping
a
count
about
him
*NL*
to
play
the
fool
.
It
's
a
good
situation
,
but
I
certainly
am
very
*NL*
degenerate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
fixed
his
eyes
for
some
time
on
the
floor
.
``
My
mother
*NL*
informed
me
,
''
he
said
presently
,
``
of
the
announcement
that
you
made
to
*NL*
her
the
other
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
desired
to
marry
your
sister
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
wished
to
arrange
a
marriage
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
slowly
,
*NL*
``
with
my
sister
,
the
Comtesse
de
Cintre
.
The
proposal
was
serious
,
and
*NL*
required
,
on
my
mother
's
part
,
a
great
deal
of
reflection
.
She
naturally
*NL*
took
me
into
her
counsels
,
and
I
gave
my
most
zealous
attention
to
the
*NL*
subject
.
There
was
a
great
deal
to
be
considered
;
more
than
you
appear
*NL*
to
imagine
.
We
have
viewed
the
question
on
all
its
faces
,
we
have
*NL*
weighed
one
thing
against
another
.
Our
conclusion
has
been
that
we
favor
*NL*
your
suit
.
My
mother
has
desired
me
to
inform
you
of
our
decision
.
*NL*
She
will
have
the
honor
of
saying
a
few
words
to
you
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
herself
.
Meanwhile
,
by
us
,
the
heads
of
the
family
,
you
are
accepted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
got
up
and
came
nearer
to
the
marquis
.
``
You
will
do
nothing
to
*NL*
hinder
me
,
and
all
you
can
to
help
me
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
recommend
my
sister
to
accept
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
,
and
pressed
it
for
a
moment
upon
*NL*
his
eyes
.
This
promise
had
a
great
sound
,
and
yet
the
pleasure
he
took
*NL*
in
it
was
embittered
by
his
having
to
stand
there
so
and
receive
his
*NL*
passport
from
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
The
idea
of
having
this
gentleman
mixed
*NL*
up
with
his
wooing
and
wedding
was
more
and
more
disagreeable
to
him
.
*NL*
But
Newman
had
resolved
to
go
through
the
mill
,
as
he
imagined
it
,
and
*NL*
he
would
not
cry
out
at
the
first
turn
of
the
wheel
.
He
was
silent
a
*NL*
while
,
and
then
he
said
,
with
a
certain
dryness
which
Valentin
told
him
*NL*
afterwards
had
a
very
grand
air
,
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
note
of
the
promise
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
I
register
the
vow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
began
to
gaze
at
the
cornice
again
;
he
apparently
had
*NL*
something
more
to
say
.
``
I
must
do
my
mother
the
justice
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
I
*NL*
must
do
myself
the
justice
,
to
say
that
our
decision
was
not
easy
.
Such
*NL*
an
arrangement
was
not
what
we
had
expected
.
The
idea
that
my
sister
*NL*
should
marry
a
gentleman
--
ah
--
in
business
was
something
of
a
novelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
told
you
,
you
know
,
''
said
Valentin
raising
his
finger
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
novelty
has
not
quite
worn
away
,
I
confess
,
''
the
marquis
went
on
;
*NL*
``
perhaps
it
never
will
,
entirely
.
But
possibly
that
is
not
altogether
*NL*
to
be
regretted
,
''
and
he
gave
his
thin
smile
again
.
``
It
may
be
that
the
*NL*
time
has
come
when
we
should
make
some
concession
to
novelty
.
There
*NL*
had
been
no
novelties
in
our
house
for
a
great
many
years
.
I
made
the
*NL*
observation
to
my
mother
,
and
she
did
me
the
honor
to
admit
that
it
was
*NL*
worthy
of
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
brother
,
''
interrupted
Valentin
,
``
is
not
your
memory
just
*NL*
here
leading
you
the
least
bit
astray
?
Our
mother
is
,
I
may
say
,
*NL*
distinguished
for
her
small
respect
of
abstract
reasoning
.
Are
you
*NL*
very
sure
that
she
replied
to
your
striking
proposition
in
the
gracious
*NL*
manner
you
describe
?
You
know
how
terribly
incisive
she
is
sometimes
.
*NL*
Did
n't
she
,
rather
,
do
you
the
honor
to
say
,
'
A
fiddlestick
for
your
*NL*
phrases
!
There
are
better
reasons
than
that
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
reasons
were
discussed
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
without
looking
*NL*
at
Valentin
,
but
with
an
audible
tremor
in
his
voice
;
``
some
of
them
*NL*
possibly
were
better
.
We
are
conservative
,
Mr.
Newman
,
but
we
are
not
*NL*
also
bigots
.
We
judged
the
matter
liberally
.
We
have
no
doubt
that
*NL*
everything
will
be
comfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
stood
listening
to
these
remarks
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
*NL*
eyes
fastened
upon
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
Comfortable
?
''
he
said
,
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
grim
flatness
of
intonation
.
``
Why
should
n't
we
be
comfortable
?
If
you
*NL*
are
not
,
it
will
be
your
own
fault
;
I
have
everything
to
make
ME
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
means
that
with
the
lapse
of
time
you
may
get
used
to
the
*NL*
change

--
and
Valentin
paused
,
to
light
another
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
change
?
''
asked
Newman
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Urbain
,
''
said
Valentin
,
very
gravely
,
``
I
am
afraid
that
Mr.
Newman
does
*NL*
not
quite
realize
the
change
.
We
ought
to
insist
upon
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
goes
too
far
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
``
It
is
his
fatal
want
*NL*
of
tact
again
.
It
is
my
mother
's
wish
,
and
mine
,
that
no
such
allusions
*NL*
should
be
made
.
Pray
never
make
them
yourself
.
We
prefer
to
assume
*NL*
that
the
person
accepted
as
the
possible
husband
of
my
sister
is
one
*NL*
of
ourselves
,
and
that
he
should
have
no
explanations
to
make
.
With
a
*NL*
little
discretion
on
both
sides
,
everything
,
I
think
,
will
be
easy
.
That
*NL*
is
exactly
what
I
wished
to
say
--
that
we
quite
understand
what
we
*NL*
have
undertaken
,
and
that
you
may
depend
upon
our
adhering
to
our
*NL*
resolution

''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
shook
his
hands
in
the
air
and
then
buried
his
face
in
them
.
``
I
*NL*
have
less
tact
than
I
might
have

no
doubt
;
but
oh
,
my
brother
,
if
you
*NL*
knew
what
you
yourself
were
saying
!

And
he
went
off
into
a
long
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
face
flushed
a
little
,
but
he
held
his
head
higher
,
*NL*
as
if
to
repudiate
this
concession
to
vulgar
perturbability
.
``
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
understand
me

''
he
said
to
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
do
n't
understand
you
at
all

said
Newman
.
``
But
you
need
n't
*NL*
mind
that
.
I
do
n't
care
.
In
fact
,
I
think
I
had
better
not
understand
*NL*
you
.
I
might
not
like
it
.
That
would
n't
suit
me
at
all
,
you
know
.
I
want
*NL*
to
marry
your
sister
,
that
's
all
;
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
to
find
fault
with
nothing
.
I
do
n't
care
how
I
do
it
.
I
am
not
marrying
*NL*
you
,
you
know
,
sir
.
I
have
got
my
leave
,
and
that
is
all
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
receive
the
last
word
from
my
mother
,
''
said
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
I
will
go
and
get
it
,
''
said
Newman
;
and
he
prepared
to
*NL*
return
to
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
made
a
motion
for
him
to
pass
first
,
and
when
Newman
*NL*
had
gone
out
he
shut
himself
into
the
room
with
Valentin
.
Newman
had
*NL*
been
a
trifle
bewildered
by
the
audacious
irony
of
the
younger
brother
,
*NL*
and
he
had
not
needed
its
aid
to
point
the
moral
of
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
transcendent
patronage
.
He
had
wit
enough
to
appreciate
the
force
*NL*
of
that
civility
which
consists
in
calling
your
attention
to
the
*NL*
impertinences
it
spares
you
.
But
he
had
felt
warmly
the
delicate
*NL*
sympathy
with
himself
that
underlay
Valentin
's
fraternal
irreverence
,
*NL*
and
he
was
most
unwilling
that
his
friend
should
pay
a
tax
upon
it
.
*NL*
He
paused
a
moment
in
the
corridor
,
after
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
,
*NL*
expecting
to
hear
the
resonance
of
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
displeasure
;
but
*NL*
he
detected
only
a
perfect
stillness
.
The
stillness
itself
seemed
a
*NL*
trifle
portentous
;
he
reflected
however
that
he
had
no
right
to
stand
*NL*
listening
,
and
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
salon
.
In
his
absence
several
*NL*
persons
had
come
in
.
They
were
scattered
about
the
room
in
groups
,
*NL*
two
or
three
of
them
having
passed
into
a
small
boudoir
,
next
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
which
had
now
been
lighted
and
opened
.
Old
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
was
in
her
place
by
the
fire
,
talking
to
a
very
old
gentleman
*NL*
in
a
wig
and
a
profuse
white
neck
cloth
of
the
fashion
of
1820
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
was
bending
a
listening
head
to
the
historic
confidences
of
*NL*
an
old
lady
who
was
presumably
the
wife
of
the
old
gentleman
in
the
*NL*
neckcloth
,
an
old
lady
in
a
red
satin
dress
and
an
ermine
cape
,
who
*NL*
wore
across
her
forehead
a
band
with
a
topaz
set
in
it
.
Young
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
,
when
Newman
came
in
,
left
some
people
among
whom
she
was
*NL*
sitting
,
and
took
the
place
that
she
had
occupied
before
dinner
.
Then
*NL*
she
gave
a
little
push
to
the
puff
that
stood
near
her
,
and
by
a
glance
*NL*
at
Newman
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
had
placed
it
in
position
for
him
.
*NL*
He
went
and
took
possession
of
it
;
the
marquis
's
wife
amused
and
puzzled
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
secret
,
''
she
said
,
in
her
bad
but
charming
English
;
``
you
*NL*
need
make
no
mystery
of
it
.
You
wish
to
marry
my
sister-in-law
.
C'est
un
*NL*
beau
choix
.
A
man
like
you
ought
to
marry
a
tall
,
thin
woman
.
You
must
*NL*
know
that
I
have
spoken
in
your
favor
;
you
owe
me
a
famous
taper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
spoken
to
Madame
de
Cintre
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
that
.
You
may
think
it
strange
,
but
my
sister-in-law
and
*NL*
I
are
not
so
intimate
as
that
.
No
;
I
spoke
to
my
husband
and
my
*NL*
mother-in-law
;
I
said
I
was
sure
we
could
do
what
we
chose
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
,
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
;
``
but
you
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
very
well
;
I
did
n't
believe
a
word
of
it
.
But
I
wanted
you
*NL*
to
come
into
the
house
;
I
thought
we
should
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sure
of
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
too
sure
.
If
you
like
Madame
de
Cintre
so
much
,
perhaps
you
*NL*
will
not
like
me
.
We
are
as
different
as
blue
and
pink
.
But
you
and
I
*NL*
have
something
in
common
.
I
have
come
into
this
family
by
marriage
;
you
*NL*
want
to
come
into
it
in
the
same
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
do
n't
!
''
interrupted
Newman
.
``
I
only
want
to
take
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
cast
your
nets
you
have
to
go
into
the
water
.
Our
positions
*NL*
are
alike
;
we
shall
be
able
to
compare
notes
.
What
do
you
think
of
my
*NL*
husband
?
It
's
a
strange
question
,
is
n't
it
?
But
I
shall
ask
you
some
*NL*
stranger
ones
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
a
stranger
one
will
be
easier
to
answer
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
*NL*
might
try
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
get
off
very
well
;
the
old
Comte
de
la
Rochefidele
,
yonder
,
*NL*
could
n't
do
it
better
.
I
told
them
that
if
we
only
gave
you
a
chance
you
*NL*
would
be
a
perfect
talon
rouge
.
I
know
something
about
men
.
Besides
,
you
*NL*
and
I
belong
to
the
same
camp
.
I
am
a
ferocious
democrat
.
By
birth
I
am
*NL*
vieille
roche
;
a
good
little
bit
of
the
history
of
France
is
the
history
*NL*
of
my
family
.
Oh
,
you
never
heard
of
us
,
of
course
!
Ce
que
c'est
que
*NL*
la
gloire
!
We
are
much
better
than
the
Bellegardes
,
at
any
rate
.
But
*NL*
I
do
n't
care
a
pin
for
my
pedigree
;
I
want
to
belong
to
my
time
.
I
'm
a
*NL*
revolutionist
,
a
radical
,
a
child
of
the
age
!
I
am
sure
I
go
beyond
you
.
*NL*
I
like
clever
people
,
wherever
they
come
from
,
and
I
take
my
amusement
*NL*
wherever
I
find
it
.
I
do
n't
pout
at
the
Empire
;
here
all
the
world
pouts
*NL*
at
the
Empire
.
Of
course
I
have
to
mind
what
I
say
;
but
I
expect
to
*NL*
take
my
revenge
with
you
.
''
Madame
de
Bellegarde
discoursed
for
some
time
*NL*
longer
in
this
sympathetic
strain
,
with
an
eager
abundance
which
seemed
*NL*
to
indicate
that
her
opportunities
for
revealing
her
esoteric
philosophy
*NL*
were
indeed
rare
.
She
hoped
that
Newman
would
never
be
afraid
of
her
,
*NL*
however
he
might
be
with
the
others
,
for
,
really
,
she
went
very
far
*NL*
indeed
.
``
Strong
people
''
--
le
gens
forts
--
were
in
her
opinion
equal
,
*NL*
all
the
world
over
.
Newman
listened
to
her
with
an
attention
at
once
*NL*
beguiled
and
irritated
.
He
wondered
what
the
deuce
she
,
too
,
was
*NL*
driving
at
,
with
her
hope
that
he
would
not
be
afraid
of
her
and
her
*NL*
protestations
of
equality
.
In
so
far
as
he
could
understand
her
,
she
was
*NL*
wrong
;
a
silly
,
rattling
woman
was
certainly
not
the
equal
of
a
sensible
*NL*
man
,
preoccupied
with
an
ambitious
passion
.
Madame
de
Bellegarde
stopped
*NL*
suddenly
,
and
looked
at
him
sharply
,
shaking
her
fan
.
``
I
see
you
do
n't
*NL*
believe
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
are
too
much
on
your
guard
.
You
will
not
*NL*
form
an
alliance
,
offensive
or
defensive
?
You
are
very
wrong
;
I
could
*NL*
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
answered
that
he
was
very
grateful
and
that
he
would
certainly
*NL*
ask
for
help
;
she
should
see
.
``
But
first
of
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
must
help
*NL*
myself
.
''
And
he
went
to
join
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
telling
Madame
de
la
Rochefidele
that
you
are
an
American
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
as
he
came
up
.
``
It
interests
her
greatly
.
Her
father
went
over
*NL*
with
the
French
troops
to
help
you
in
your
battles
in
the
last
century
,
*NL*
and
she
has
always
,
in
consequence
,
wanted
greatly
to
see
an
American
.
*NL*
But
she
has
never
succeeded
till
to-night
.
You
are
the
first
--
to
her
*NL*
knowledge
--
that
she
has
ever
looked
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
la
Rochefidele
had
an
aged
,
cadaverous
face
,
with
a
falling
of
*NL*
the
lower
jaw
which
prevented
her
from
bringing
her
lips
together
,
and
*NL*
reduced
her
conversations
to
a
series
of
impressive
but
inarticulate
*NL*
gutturals
.
She
raised
an
antique
eyeglass
,
elaborately
mounted
in
chased
*NL*
silver
,
and
looked
at
Newman
from
head
to
foot
.
Then
she
said
something
*NL*
to
which
he
listened
deferentially
,
but
which
he
completely
failed
to
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
la
Rochefidele
says
that
she
is
convinced
that
she
must
have
*NL*
seen
Americans
without
knowing
it
,
''
Madame
de
Cintre
explained
.
Newman
*NL*
thought
it
probable
she
had
seen
a
great
many
things
without
knowing
it
;
*NL*
and
the
old
lady
,
again
addressing
herself
to
utterance
,
declared
--
as
*NL*
interpreted
by
Madame
de
Cintre
--
that
she
wished
she
had
known
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
old
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
to
the
elder
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
drew
near
,
leading
the
marquise
on
his
arm
.
His
*NL*
wife
pointed
out
Newman
to
him
,
apparently
explaining
his
remarkable
*NL*
origin
.
M.
de
la
Rochefidele
,
whose
old
age
was
rosy
and
rotund
,
spoke
*NL*
very
neatly
and
clearly
,
almost
as
prettily
,
Newman
thought
,
as
M.
*NL*
Nioche
.
When
he
had
been
enlightened
,
he
turned
to
Newman
with
an
*NL*
inimitable
elderly
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
is
by
no
means
the
first
American
that
I
have
seen
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Almost
the
first
person
I
ever
saw
--
to
notice
him
--
was
an
American
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
?
''
said
Newman
,
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
Dr.
Franklin
,
''
said
M.
de
la
Rochefidele
.
``
Of
course
I
was
*NL*
very
young
.
He
was
received
very
well
in
our
monde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
better
than
Mr.
Newman
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
I
beg
he
*NL*
will
offer
his
arm
into
the
other
room
.
I
could
have
offered
no
higher
*NL*
privilege
to
Dr.
Franklin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
complying
with
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
request
,
perceived
that
*NL*
her
two
sons
had
returned
to
the
drawing-room
.
He
scanned
their
faces
*NL*
an
instant
for
traces
of
the
scene
that
had
followed
his
separation
from
*NL*
them
,
but
the
marquise
seemed
neither
more
nor
less
frigidly
grand
than
*NL*
usual
,
and
Valentin
was
kissing
ladies
'
hands
with
at
least
his
habitual
*NL*
air
of
self-abandonment
to
the
act
.
Madame
de
Bellegarde
gave
a
glance
*NL*
at
her
eldest
son
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
*NL*
her
boudoir
he
was
at
her
side
.
The
room
was
now
empty
and
offered
*NL*
a
sufficient
degree
of
privacy
.
The
old
lady
disengaged
herself
from
*NL*
Newman
's
arm
and
rested
her
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
marquis
;
and
in
this
*NL*
position
she
stood
a
moment
,
holding
her
head
high
and
biting
her
small
*NL*
under-lip
.
I
am
afraid
the
picture
was
lost
upon
Newman
,
but
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
was
,
in
fact
,
at
this
moment
a
striking
image
of
the
dignity
*NL*
which
--
even
in
the
case
of
a
little
time-shrunken
old
lady
--
may
reside
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
unquestioned
authority
and
the
absoluteness
of
a
social
*NL*
theory
favorable
to
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
son
has
spoken
to
you
as
I
desired
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
you
understand
*NL*
that
we
shall
not
interfere
.
The
rest
will
lie
with
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Bellegarde
told
me
several
things
I
did
n't
understand
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
,
``
but
I
made
out
that
.
You
will
leave
me
open
field
.
I
am
much
*NL*
obliged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
add
a
word
that
my
son
probably
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
*NL*
say
,
''
the
marquise
rejoined
.
``
I
must
say
it
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
.
We
*NL*
are
stretching
a
point
;
we
are
doing
you
a
great
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
your
son
said
it
very
well
;
did
n't
you
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
well
as
my
mother
,
''
declared
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
repeat
--
I
am
much
obliged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
proper
I
should
tell
you
,
''
Madame
de
Bellegarde
went
on
,
``
that
I
*NL*
am
very
proud
,
and
that
I
hold
my
head
very
high
.
I
may
be
wrong
,
but
*NL*
I
am
too
old
to
change
.
At
least
I
know
it
,
and
I
do
n't
pretend
to
*NL*
anything
else
.
Do
n't
flatter
yourself
that
my
daughter
is
not
proud
.
She
*NL*
is
proud
in
her
own
way
--
a
somewhat
different
way
from
mine
.
You
will
*NL*
have
to
make
your
terms
with
that
.
Even
Valentin
is
proud
,
if
you
touch
*NL*
the
right
spot
--
or
the
wrong
one
.
Urbain
is
proud
;
that
you
see
for
*NL*
yourself
.
Sometimes
I
think
he
is
a
little
too
proud
;
but
I
would
n't
*NL*
change
him
.
He
is
the
best
of

he
cleaves
to
his
old
mother
.
*NL*
But
I
have
said
enough
to
show
you
that
we
are
all
proud
together
.
It
is
*NL*
well
that
you
should
know
the
sort
of
people
you
have
come
among
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
can
only
say
,
in
return
,
that
I
am
NOT
proud
;
*NL*
I
sha
n't
mind
you
!
But
you
speak
as
if
you
intended
to
be
very
*NL*
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
enjoy
having
my
daughter
marry
you
,
and
I
shall
not
pretend
*NL*
to
enjoy
it
.
If
you
do
n't
mind
that
,
so
much
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
stick
to
your
own
side
of
the
contract
we
shall
not
quarrel
;
*NL*
that
is
all
I
ask
of
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Keep
your
hands
off
,
and
*NL*
give
me
an
open
field
.
I
am
very
much
in
earnest
,
and
there
is
not
the
*NL*
slightest
danger
of
my
getting
discouraged
or
backing
out

You
will
have
*NL*
me
constantly
before
your

you
do

I
am
sorry

do
for
your

accept
me
everything
that
*NL*
a
man
can
do
for
a
woman
.
I
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
,
as
a
promise
--
a
*NL*
pledge
.
I
consider
that
on
your
side
you
make
me
an
equal
pledge

You
*NL*
will
not
back
out

eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
`
backing
out

''
said
the
marquise
.
*NL*
``
It
suggests
a
movement
of
which
I
think
no
Bellegarde
has
ever
been
*NL*
guilty

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
word
is
our
word
,
''
said
Urbain
.
``
We
have
given
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
am
very
glad
you
are
so
proud
.
It
makes
me
*NL*
believe
that
you
will
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
was
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
,
suddenly
,
``
I
shall
always
be
*NL*
polite
to
you
,
Mr.
Newman
,
''
she
declared
,
``
but
,
decidedly
,
I
shall
never
*NL*
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
too
sure
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
sure
that
I
will
ask
you
to
take
me
back
to
my
arm-chair
*NL*
without
the
least
fear
of
having
my
sentiments
modified
by
the
service
*NL*
you
render
me
.
''
And
Madame
de
Bellegarde
took
his
arm
,
and
returned
to
*NL*
the
salon
and
to
her
customary
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
la
Rochefidele
and
his
wife
were
preparing
to
take
their
leave
,
*NL*
and
Madame
de
Cintre
's
interview
with
the
mumbling
old
lady
was
at
an
*NL*
end
.
She
stood
looking
about
her
,
asking
herself
,
apparently
to
whom
she
*NL*
should
next
speak
,
when
Newman
came
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
has
given
me
leave
--
very
solemnly
--
to
come
here
often
,

he
*NL*
said
.
``
I
mean
to
come
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
,
''
she
answered
,
simply
.
And
then
,
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
You
probably
think
it
very
strange
that
there
should
be
such
a
*NL*
solemnity

as
you
say

about

coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
;
I
do
,
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
what
my
brother
Valentin
said
,
the
first
time
you
came
*NL*
to
see
me

that
we
were
a
strange
,
strange
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
the
first
time
I
came
,
but
the
second
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true

Valentin
annoyed
me
at
the
time
,
but
now
I
know
you
better

*NL*
I
may
tell
you
he
was
right
.
If
you
come
often
,
you
will
see
!
''
and
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
watched
her
a
while
,
talking
with
other
people
,
and
then
he
took
*NL*
his
leave
.
He
shook
hands
last
with
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
,
who
came
out
*NL*
with
him
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
.
``
Well
,
you
have
got
your
permit
,
''
*NL*
said
Valentin
.
``
I
hope
you
liked
the
process

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
your
sister
,
more
than
ever

But
do
n't
worry
your
brother
any
*NL*
more
for
my
sake
,
''
Newman
added
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
him
.
I
am
afraid
he
came
*NL*
down
on
you
in
the
smoking-room
,
after
I
went
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
my
brother
comes
down
on
me
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
he
falls
hard
.
I
*NL*
have
a
peculiar
way
of
receiving
him
.
I
must
say
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
*NL*
they
came
up
to
the
mark
much
sooner
than
I
expected
.
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
it
,
they
must
have
had
to
turn
the
screw
pretty
tight

It
's
a
tribute
to
*NL*
your
millions

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
the
most
precious
one
they
have
ever
received
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
turning
away
when
Valentin
stopped
him
,
looking
at
him
with
a
*NL*
brilliant
,
softly-cynical
glance
.
``
I
should
like
to
know
whether
,
within
*NL*
a
few
days
,
you
have
seen
your
venerable
friend
M.
Nioche
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
yesterday
at
my
rooms
,
''
Newman
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
see
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
sticking
out
of
his
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
driving
at
?
''
Newman
demanded
.
``
I
thought
he
seemed
rather
*NL*
cheerful
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
broke
into
a
laugh
.
``
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
!
I
win
my
bet
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
has
thrown
her
cap
over
the
mill
,
as
we
say
.
She
*NL*
has
left
the
paternal
domicile
.
She
is
launched
!
And
M.
Nioche
is
rather
*NL*
cheerful
--
FOR
HIM
!
Do
n't
brandish
your
tomahawk
at
that
rate
;
I
have
*NL*
not
seen
her
nor
communicated
with
her
since
that
day
at
the
Louvre
.
*NL*
Andromeda
has
found
another
Perseus
than
I.
My
information
is
exact
;
*NL*
on
such
matters
it
always
is

I
suppose
that
now
you
will
raise
your
*NL*
protest

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
protest
be
hanged

''
murmured
Newman
,
disgustedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
tone
found
no
echo
in
that
in
which
Valentin
,
with
his
hand
on
*NL*
the
door
,
to
return
to
his
mother
's
apartment
,
exclaimed
,
``
But
I
shall
*NL*
see

very
remarkable

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
kept
his
promise
,
or
his
menace
,
of
going
often
to
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Universite
,
and
during
the
next
six
weeks
he
saw
Madame
de
Cintre
more
*NL*
times
than
he
could
have
numbered
.
He
flattered
himself
that
he
was
not
*NL*
in
love
,
but
his
biographer
may
be
supposed
to
know
better
.
He
claimed
,
*NL*
at
least
,
none
of
the
exemptions
and
emoluments
of
the
romantic
passion
.
*NL*
Love
,
he
believed
,
made
a
fool
of
a
man
,
and
his
present
emotion
was
not
*NL*
folly
but
wisdom
;
wisdom
sound
,
serene
,
well-directed
.
What
he
felt
*NL*
was
an
intense
,
all-consuming
tenderness
,
which
had
for
its
object
an
*NL*
extraordinarily
graceful
and
delicate
,
and
at
the
same
time
impressive
,
*NL*
woman
who
lived
in
a
large
gray
house
on
the
left
bank
of
the
Seine
.
*NL*
This
tenderness
turned
very
often
into
a
positive
heart-ache
;
a
sign
*NL*
in
which
,
certainly
,
Newman
ought
to
have
read
the
appellation
which
*NL*
science
has
conferred
upon
his
sentiment
.
When
the
heart
has
a
heavy
*NL*
weight
upon
it
,
it
hardly
matters
whether
the
weight
be
of
gold
or
of
*NL*
lead
;
when
,
at
any
rate
,
happiness
passes
into
that
place
in
which
it
*NL*
becomes
identical
with
pain
,
a
man
may
admit
that
the
reign
of
wisdom
*NL*
is
temporarily
suspended
.
Newman
wished
Madame
de
Cintre
so
well
that
*NL*
nothing
he
could
think
of
doing
for
her
in
the
future
rose
to
the
high
*NL*
standard
which
his
present
mood
had
set
itself
.
She
seemed
to
him
so
*NL*
felicitous
a
product
of
nature
and
circumstance
that
his
invention
,
*NL*
musing
on
future
combinations
,
was
constantly
catching
its
breath
with
*NL*
the
fear
of
stumbling
into
some
brutal
compression
or
mutilation
of
her
*NL*
beautiful
personal
harmony
.
This
is
what
I
mean
by
Newman
's
tenderness
:
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
pleased
him
so
,
exactly
as
she
was
,
that
his
desire
*NL*
to
interpose
between
her
and
the
troubles
of
life
had
the
quality
of
a
*NL*
young
mother
's
eagerness
to
protect
the
sleep
of
her
first-born
child
.
*NL*
Newman
was
simply
charmed
,
and
he
handled
his
charm
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
music-box
which
would
stop
if
one
shook
it
.
There
can
be
no
better
proof
*NL*
of
the
hankering
epicure
that
is
hidden
in
every
man
's
temperament
,
*NL*
waiting
for
a
signal
from
some
divine
confederate
that
he
may
safely
*NL*
peep
out
.
Newman
at
last
was
enjoying
,
purely
,
freely
,
deeply
.
Certain
*NL*
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
personal
qualities
--
the
luminous
sweetness
of
*NL*
her
eyes
,
the
delicate
mobility
of
her
face
,
the
deep
liquidity
of
her
*NL*
voice
--
filled
all
his
consciousness
.
A
rose-crowned
Greek
of
old
,
gazing
*NL*
at
a
marble
goddess
with
his
whole
bright
intellect
resting
satisfied
*NL*
in
the
act
,
could
not
have
been
a
more
complete
embodiment
of
the
wisdom
*NL*
that
loses
itself
in
the
enjoyment
of
quiet
harmonies
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
violent
love
to
her
--
no
sentimental
speeches
.
He
never
*NL*
trespassed
on
what
she
had
made
him
understand
was
for
the
present
*NL*
forbidden
ground
.
But
he
had
,
nevertheless
,
a
comfortable
sense
that
she
*NL*
knew
better
from
day
to
day
how
much
he
admired
her
.
Though
in
general
*NL*
he
was
no
great
talker
,
he
talked
much
,
and
he
succeeded
perfectly
in
*NL*
making
her
say
many
things
.
He
was
not
afraid
of
boring
her
,
either
by
*NL*
his
discourse
or
by
his
silence
;
and
whether
or
no
he
did
occasionally
*NL*
bore
her
,
it
is
probable
that
on
the
whole
she
liked
him
only
the
better
*NL*
for
his
absense
of
embarrassed
scruples
.
Her
visitors
,
coming
in
*NL*
often
while
Newman
sat
there
,
found
a
tall
,
lean
,
silent
man
in
a
*NL*
half-lounging
attitude
,
who
laughed
out
sometimes
when
no
one
had
*NL*
meant
to
be
droll
,
and
remained
grave
in
the
presence
of
calculated
*NL*
witticisms
,
for
appreciation
of
which
he
had
apparently
not
the
proper
*NL*
culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
confessed
that
the
number
of
subjects
upon
which
Newman
had
*NL*
no
ideas
was
extremely
large
,
and
it
must
be
added
that
as
regards
those
*NL*
subjects
upon
which
he
was
without
ideas
he
was
also
perfectly
without
*NL*
words
.
He
had
little
of
the
small
change
of
conversation
,
and
his
stock
*NL*
of
ready-made
formulas
and
phrases
was
the
scantiest
.
On
the
other
hand
*NL*
he
had
plenty
of
attention
to
bestow
,
and
his
estimate
of
the
importance
*NL*
of
a
topic
did
not
depend
upon
the
number
of
clever
things
he
could
say
*NL*
about
it
.
He
himself
was
almost
never
bored
,
and
there
was
no
man
with
*NL*
whom
it
would
have
been
a
greater
mistake
to
suppose
that
silence
*NL*
meant
displeasure
.
What
it
was
that
entertained
him
during
some
of
his
*NL*
speechless
sessions
I
must
,
however
,
confess
myself
unable
to
determine
.
*NL*
We
know
in
a
general
way
that
a
great
many
things
which
were
old
stories
*NL*
to
a
great
many
people
had
the
charm
of
novelty
to
him
,
but
a
complete
*NL*
list
of
his
new
impressions
would
probably
contain
a
number
of
surprises
*NL*
for
us
.
He
told
Madame
de
Cintre
a
hundred
long
stories
;
he
explained
*NL*
to
her
,
in
talking
of
the
United
States
,
the
working
of
various
local
*NL*
institutions
and
mercantile
customs
.
Judging
by
the
sequel
she
was
*NL*
interested
,
but
one
would
not
have
been
sure
of
it
beforehand
.
As
*NL*
regards
her
own
talk
,
Newman
was
very
sure
himself
that
she
herself
*NL*
enjoyed
it
:
this
was
as
a
sort
of
amendment
to
the
portrait
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
had
drawn
of
her
.
He
discovered
that
she
had
naturally
an
*NL*
abundance
of
gayety
.
He
had
been
right
at
first
in
saying
she
was
shy
;
*NL*
her
shyness
,
in
a
woman
whose
circumstances
and
tranquil
beauty
afforded
*NL*
every
facility
for
well-mannered
hardihood
,
was
only
a
charm
the
more
.
*NL*
For
Newman
it
had
lasted
some
time
,
and
even
when
it
went
it
left
*NL*
something
behind
it
which
for
a
while
performed
the
same
office
.
Was
*NL*
this
the
tearful
secret
of
which
Mrs.
Tristram
had
had
a
glimpse
,
and
*NL*
of
which
,
as
of
her
friend
's
reserve
,
her
high-breeding
,
and
her
*NL*
profundity
,
she
had
given
a
sketch
of
which
the
outlines
were
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
rather
too
heavy
?
Newman
supposed
so
,
but
he
found
himself
wondering
*NL*
less
every
day
what
Madame
de
Cintre
's
secrets
might
be
,
and
more
*NL*
convinced
that
secrets
were
,
in
themselves
,
hateful
things
to
her
.
She
*NL*
was
a
woman
for
the
light
,
not
for
the
shade
;
and
her
natural
line
was
*NL*
not
picturesque
reserve
and
mysterious
melancholy
,
but
frank
,
joyous
,
*NL*
brilliant
action
,
with
just
so
much
meditation
as
was
necessary
,
and
*NL*
not
a
grain
more
.
To
this
,
apparently
,
he
had
succeeded
in
bringing
her
*NL*
back
.
He
felt
,
himself
,
that
he
was
an
antidote
to
oppressive
secrets
;
*NL*
what
he
offered
her
was
,
in
fact
,
above
all
things
a
vast
,
sunny
*NL*
immunity
from
the
need
of
having
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
often
passed
his
evenings
,
when
Madame
de
Cintre
had
so
appointed
it
,
*NL*
at
the
chilly
fireside
of
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
contenting
himself
with
*NL*
looking
across
the
room
,
through
narrowed
eyelids
,
at
his
mistress
,
who
*NL*
always
made
a
point
,
before
her
family
,
of
talking
to
some
one
else
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
sat
by
the
fire
conversing
neatly
and
coldly
*NL*
with
whomsoever
approached
her
,
and
glancing
round
the
room
with
her
*NL*
slowly-restless
eye
,
the
effect
of
which
,
when
it
lighted
upon
him
,
was
*NL*
to
Newman
's
sense
identical
with
that
of
a
sudden
spurt
of
damp
air
.
*NL*
When
he
shook
hands
with
her
he
always
asked
her
with
a
laugh
whether
*NL*
she
could
``
stand
him
''
another
evening
,
and
she
replied
,
without
a
laugh
,
*NL*
that
thank
God
she
had
always
been
able
to
do
her
duty
.
Newman
,
talking
*NL*
once
of
the
marquise
to
Mrs.
Tristram
,
said
that
after
all
it
was
very
*NL*
easy
to
get
on
with
her
;
it
always
was
easy
to
get
on
with
out-and-out
*NL*
rascals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
by
that
elegant
term
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
that
you
*NL*
designate
the
Marquise
de
Bellegarde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
she
is
wicked
,
she
is
an
old
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
her
crime
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
wonder
if
she
had
murdered
some
one
--
all
from
a
sense
of
*NL*
duty
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
so
dreadful
?
''
sighed
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
dreadful
.
I
am
speaking
of
her
favorably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
what
will
you
say
when
you
want
to
be
severe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
keep
my
severity
for
some
one
else
--
for
the
marquis
.
There
's
a
*NL*
man
I
ca
n't
swallow
,
mix
the
drink
as
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
has
HE
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
quite
make
out
;
it
is
something
dreadfully
bad
,
something
*NL*
mean
and
underhand
,
and
not
redeemed
by
audacity
,
as
his
mother
's
*NL*
misdemeanors
may
have
been
.
If
he
has
never
committed
murder
,
he
has
at
*NL*
least
turned
his
back
and
looked
the
other
way
while
some
one
else
was
*NL*
committing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
invidious
hypothesis
,
which
must
be
taken
for
nothing
*NL*
more
than
an
example
of
the
capricious
play
of
``
American
humor
,
''
Newman
*NL*
did
his
best
to
maintain
an
easy
and
friendly
style
of
communication
*NL*
with
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
So
long
as
he
was
in
personal
contact
with
people
*NL*
he
disliked
extremely
to
have
anything
to
forgive
them
,
and
he
was
*NL*
capable
of
a
good
deal
of
unsuspected
imaginative
effort
-LRB-
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
his
own
personal
comfort
-RRB-
to
assume
for
the
time
that
they
were
*NL*
good
fellows
.
He
did
his
best
to
treat
the
marquis
as
one
;
he
believed
*NL*
honestly
,
moreover
,
that
he
could
not
,
in
reason
,
be
such
a
confounded
*NL*
fool
as
he
seemed
.
Newman
's
familiarity
was
never
importunate
;
his
sense
*NL*
of
human
equality
was
not
an
aggressive
taste
or
an
aesthetic
theory
,
*NL*
but
something
as
natural
and
organic
as
a
physical
appetite
which
had
*NL*
never
been
put
on
a
scanty
allowance
and
consequently
was
innocent
of
*NL*
ungraceful
eagerness
.
His
tranquil
unsuspectingness
of
the
relativity
*NL*
of
his
own
place
in
the
social
scale
was
probably
irritating
to
M.
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
,
who
saw
himself
reflected
in
the
mind
of
his
potential
*NL*
brother-in-law
in
a
crude
and
colorless
form
,
unpleasantly
dissimilar
*NL*
to
the
impressive
image
projected
upon
his
own
intellectual
mirror
.
He
*NL*
never
forgot
himself
for
an
instant
,
and
replied
to
what
he
must
have
*NL*
considered
Newman
's
``
advances
''
with
mechanical
politeness
.
Newman
,
who
*NL*
was
constantly
forgetting
himself
,
and
indulging
in
an
unlimited
amount
*NL*
of
irresponsible
inquiry
and
conjecture
,
now
and
then
found
himself
*NL*
confronted
by
the
conscious
,
ironical
smile
of
his
host
.
What
the
*NL*
deuce
M.
de
Bellegarde
was
smiling
at
he
was
at
a
loss
to
divine
.
M.
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
's
smile
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
,
for
himself
,
a
*NL*
compromise
between
a
great
many
emotions
.
So
long
as
he
smiled
he
*NL*
was
polite
,
and
it
was
proper
he
should
be
polite
.
A
smile
,
moreover
,
*NL*
committed
him
to
nothing
more
than
politeness
,
and
left
the
degree
of
*NL*
politeness
agreeably
vague
.
A
smile
,
too
,
was
neither
dissent
--
which
*NL*
was
too
serious
--
nor
agreement
,
which
might
have
brought
on
terrible
*NL*
complications
.
And
then
a
smile
covered
his
own
personal
dignity
,
which
*NL*
in
this
critical
situation
he
was
resolved
to
keep
immaculate
;
it
was
*NL*
quite
enough
that
the
glory
of
his
house
should
pass
into
eclipse
.
*NL*
Between
him
and
Newman
,
his
whole
manner
seemed
to
declare
there
could
*NL*
be
no
interchange
of
opinion
;
he
was
holding
his
breath
so
as
not
*NL*
to
inhale
the
odor
of
democracy
.
Newman
was
far
from
being
versed
in
*NL*
European
politics
,
but
he
liked
to
have
a
general
idea
of
what
was
going
*NL*
on
about
him
,
and
he
accordingly
asked
M.
de
Bellegarde
several
times
*NL*
what
he
thought
of
public
affairs
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
answered
with
suave
*NL*
concision
that
he
thought
as
ill
of
them
as
possible
,
that
they
were
*NL*
going
from
bad
to
worse
,
and
that
the
age
was
rotten
to
its
core
.
This
*NL*
gave
Newman
,
for
the
moment
,
an
almost
kindly
feeling
for
the
marquis
;
*NL*
he
pitied
a
man
for
whom
the
world
was
so
cheerless
a
place
,
and
the
*NL*
next
time
he
saw
M.
de
Bellegarde
he
attempted
to
call
his
attention
*NL*
to
some
of
the
brilliant
features
of
the
time
.
The
marquis
presently
*NL*
replied
that
he
had
but
a
single
political
conviction
,
which
was
enough
*NL*
for
him
:
he
believed
in
the
divine
right
of
Henry
of
Bourbon
,
Fifth
*NL*
of
his
name
,
to
the
throne
of
France
.
Newman
stared
,
and
after
this
he
*NL*
ceased
to
talk
politics
with
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
He
was
not
horrified
nor
*NL*
scandalized
,
he
was
not
even
amused
;
he
felt
as
he
should
have
felt
if
*NL*
he
had
discovered
in
M.
de
Bellegarde
a
taste
for
certain
oddities
of
*NL*
diet
;
an
appetite
,
for
instance
,
for
fishbones
or
nutshells
.
Under
these
*NL*
circumstances
,
of
course
,
he
would
never
have
broached
dietary
questions
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
on
his
calling
on
Madame
de
Cintre
,
Newman
was
requested
*NL*
by
the
servant
to
wait
a
few
moments
,
as
his
hostess
was
not
at
liberty
.
*NL*
He
walked
about
the
room
a
while
,
taking
up
her
books
,
smelling
her
*NL*
flowers
,
and
looking
at
her
prints
and
photographs
-LRB-
which
he
thought
*NL*
prodigiously
pretty
-RRB-
,
and
at
last
he
heard
the
opening
of
a
door
to
*NL*
which
his
back
was
turned
.
On
the
threshold
stood
an
old
woman
whom
he
*NL*
remembered
to
have
met
several
times
in
entering
and
leaving
the
house
.
*NL*
She
was
tall
and
straight
and
dressed
in
black
,
and
she
wore
a
cap
*NL*
which
,
if
Newman
had
been
initiated
into
such
mysteries
,
would
have
been
*NL*
a
sufficient
assurance
that
she
was
not
a
Frenchwoman
;
a
cap
of
pure
*NL*
British
composition
.
She
had
a
pale
,
decent
,
depressed-looking
face
,
and
*NL*
a
clear
,
dull
,
English
eye
.
She
looked
at
Newman
a
moment
,
both
intently
*NL*
and
timidly
,
and
then
she
dropped
a
short
,
straight
English
curtsey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Cintre
begs
you
will
kindly
wait
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
has
just
*NL*
come
in
;
she
will
soon
have
finished
dressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
wait
as
long
as
she
wants
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Pray
tell
her
not
*NL*
to
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
the
woman
,
softly
;
and
then
,
instead
of
retiring
*NL*
with
her
message
,
she
advanced
into
the
room
.
She
looked
about
her
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
presently
went
to
a
table
and
began
to
arrange
certain
books
*NL*
and
knick-knacks
.
Newman
was
struck
with
the
high
respectability
of
*NL*
her
appearance
;
he
was
afraid
to
address
her
as
a
servant
.
She
busied
*NL*
herself
for
some
moments
with
putting
the
table
in
order
and
pulling
the
*NL*
curtains
straight
,
while
Newman
walked
slowly
to
and
fro
.
He
perceived
*NL*
at
last
from
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
,
as
he
was
passing
that
her
*NL*
hands
were
idle
and
that
she
was
looking
at
him
intently
.
She
evidently
*NL*
wished
to
say
something
,
and
Newman
,
perceiving
it
,
helped
her
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
English
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
please
,
''
she
answered
,
quickly
and
softly
;
``
I
was
born
in
*NL*
Wiltshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
think
of
Paris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
of
Paris
,
sir
,
''
she
said
in
the
same
tone
.
``
It
is
so
*NL*
long
since
I
have
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
been
here
very
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
than
forty
years
,
sir
.
I
came
over
with
Lady
Emmeline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
with
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
came
with
her
when
she
was
married
.
I
was
my
lady
's
own
*NL*
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
been
with
her
ever
since
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
the
house
ever
since
.
My
lady
has
taken
a
younger
*NL*
person
.
You
see
I
am
very
old
.
I
do
nothing
regular
now
.
But
I
keep
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
very
strong
and
well
,
''
said
Newman
,
observing
the
erectness
of
*NL*
her
figure
,
and
a
certain
venerable
rosiness
in
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
I
am
not
ill
,
sir
;
I
hope
I
know
my
duty
too
well
to
go
*NL*
panting
and
coughing
about
the
house
.
But
I
am
an
old
woman
,
sir
,
and
it
*NL*
is
as
an
old
woman
that
I
venture
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
speak
out
,
''
said
Newman
,
curiously
.
``
You
need
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
I
think
you
are
kind
.
I
have
seen
you
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
stairs
,
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
When
you
have
been
coming
to
see
the
countess
.
I
have
taken
*NL*
the
liberty
of
noticing
that
you
come
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
I
come
very
often
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
.
``
You
need
not
have
*NL*
been
wide-awake
to
notice
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
noticed
it
with
pleasure
,
sir
,
''
said
the
ancient
tire-woman
,
*NL*
gravely
.
And
she
stood
looking
at
Newman
with
a
strange
expression
of
*NL*
face
.
The
old
instinct
of
deference
and
humility
was
there
;
the
habit
*NL*
of
decent
self-effacement
and
knowledge
of
her
``
own
place
.
''
But
there
*NL*
mingled
with
it
a
certain
mild
audacity
,
born
of
the
occasion
and
of
a
*NL*
sense
,
probably
,
of
Newman
's
unprecedented
approachableness
,
and
,
beyond
*NL*
this
,
a
vague
indifference
to
the
old
proprieties
;
as
if
my
lady
's
own
*NL*
woman
had
at
last
begun
to
reflect
that
,
since
my
lady
had
taken
another
*NL*
person
,
she
had
a
slight
reversionary
property
in
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
a
great
interest
in
the
family
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
deep
interest
,
sir
.
Especially
in
the
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
And
in
a
moment
he
added
,
smiling
,
``
So
*NL*
do
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
suppose
,
sir
.
We
ca
n't
help
noticing
these
things
and
having
our
*NL*
ideas
;
can
we
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
as
a
servant
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
it
is
,
sir
.
I
am
afraid
that
when
I
let
my
thoughts
meddle
*NL*
with
such
matters
I
am
no
longer
a
servant
.
But
I
am
so
devoted
to
the
*NL*
countess
;
if
she
were
my
own
child
I
could
n't
love
her
more
.
That
is
how
*NL*
I
come
to
be
so
bold
,
sir
.
They
say
you
want
to
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
eyed
his
interlocutress
and
satisfied
himself
that
she
was
not
*NL*
a
gossip
,
but
a
zealot
;
she
looked
anxious
,
appealing
,
discreet
.
``
It
is
*NL*
quite
true
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
want
to
marry
Madame
de
Cintre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
take
her
away
to
America
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
her
wherever
she
wants
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
farther
away
the
better
,
sir
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
woman
,
with
sudden
*NL*
intensity
.
But
she
checked
herself
,
and
,
taking
up
a
paper-weight
in
*NL*
mosaic
,
began
to
polish
it
with
her
black
apron
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
anything
*NL*
against
the
house
or
the
family
,
sir
.
But
I
think
a
great
change
would
*NL*
do
the
poor
countess
good
.
It
is
very
sad
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
not
very
lively
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
Madame
de
Cintre
is
gay
*NL*
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
everything
that
is
good
.
You
will
not
be
vexed
to
hear
that
she
*NL*
has
been
gayer
for
a
couple
of
months
past
than
she
had
been
in
many
a
*NL*
day
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
delighted
to
gather
this
testimony
to
the
prosperity
of
his
*NL*
suit
,
but
he
repressed
all
violent
marks
of
elation
.
``
Has
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
been
in
bad
spirits
before
this
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
lady
,
she
had
good
reason
.
M.
de
Cintre
was
no
husband
for
a
sweet
*NL*
young
lady
like
that
.
And
then
,
as
I
say
,
it
has
been
a
sad
house
.
It
is
*NL*
better
,
in
my
humble
opinion
,
that
she
were
out
of
it
.
So
,
if
you
will
*NL*
excuse
me
for
saying
so
,
I
hope
she
will
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
will
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
not
lose
courage
,
sir
,
if
she
does
n't
make
up
her
mind
at
*NL*
once
.
That
is
what
I
wanted
to
beg
of
you
,
sir
.
Do
n't
give
it
up
,
sir
.
*NL*
You
will
not
take
it
ill
if
I
say
it
's
a
great
risk
for
any
lady
at
any
*NL*
time
;
all
the
more
when
she
has
got
rid
of
one
bad
bargain
.
But
if
she
*NL*
can
marry
a
good
,
kind
,
respectable
gentleman
,
I
think
she
had
better
*NL*
make
up
her
mind
to
it
.
They
speak
very
well
of
you
,
sir
,
in
the
house
,
*NL*
and
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
,
I
like
your
face
.
You
have
a
very
*NL*
different
appearance
from
the
late
count
,
he
was
n't
five
feet
high
.
And
*NL*
they
say
your
fortune
is
beyond
everything
.
There
's
no
harm
in
that
.
So
*NL*
I
beseech
you
to
be
patient
,
sir
,
and
bide
your
time
.
If
I
do
n't
say
*NL*
this
to
you
,
sir
,
perhaps
no
one
will
.
Of
course
it
is
not
for
me
to
*NL*
make
any
promises
.
I
can
answer
for
nothing
.
But
I
think
your
chance
is
*NL*
not
so
bad
,
sir
.
I
am
nothing
but
a
weary
old
woman
in
my
quiet
corner
,
*NL*
but
one
woman
understands
another
,
and
I
think
I
make
out
the
countess
.
*NL*
I
received
her
in
my
arms
when
she
came
into
the
world
and
her
first
*NL*
wedding
day
was
the
saddest
of
my
life
.
She
owes
it
to
me
to
show
me
*NL*
another
and
a
brighter
one
.
If
you
will
hold
firm
,
sir
--
and
you
look
as
*NL*
if
you
would
--
I
think
we
may
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
encouragement
,
''
said
Newman
,
*NL*
heartily
.
``
One
ca
n't
have
too
much
.
I
mean
to
hold
firm
.
And
if
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
marries
me
you
must
come
and
live
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
looked
at
him
strangely
,
with
her
soft
,
lifeless
eyes
.
``
It
*NL*
may
seem
a
heartless
thing
to
say
,
sir
,
when
one
has
been
forty
years
in
*NL*
a
house
,
but
I
may
tell
you
that
I
should
like
to
leave
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
just
the
time
to
say
it
,
''
said
Newman
,
fervently
.
``
After
*NL*
forty
years
one
wants
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
sir
;
''
and
this
faithful
servant
dropped
another
*NL*
curtsey
and
seemed
disposed
to
retire
.
But
she
lingered
a
moment
and
*NL*
gave
a
timid
,
joyless
smile
.
Newman
was
disappointed
,
and
his
fingers
*NL*
stole
half
shyly
half
irritably
into
his
waistcoat-pocket
.
His
informant
*NL*
noticed
the
movement
.
``
Thank
God
I
am
not
a
Frenchwoman
,
''
she
said
.
``
If
*NL*
I
were
,
I
would
tell
you
with
a
brazen
simper
,
old
as
I
am
,
that
if
you
*NL*
please
,
monsieur
,
my
information
is
worth
something
.
Let
me
tell
you
so
*NL*
in
my
own
decent
English
way
.
It
IS
worth
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
,
please
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
this
:
a
promise
not
to
hint
to
the
countess
that
I
have
said
*NL*
these
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
all
,
you
have
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
,
sir
.
Thank
you
,
sir
.
Good
day
,
sir
.
''
And
having
once
*NL*
more
slid
down
telescope-wise
into
her
scanty
petticoats
,
the
old
woman
*NL*
departed
.
At
the
same
moment
Madame
de
Cintre
came
in
by
an
opposite
*NL*
door
.
She
noticed
the
movement
of
the
other
portiere
and
asked
Newman
*NL*
who
had
been
entertaining
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
British
female
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
An
old
lady
in
a
black
dress
and
a
*NL*
cap
,
who
curtsies
up
and
down
,
and
expresses
herself
ever
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
lady
who
curtsies
and
expresses
herself
?
...
Ah
,
you
mean
poor
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
.
I
happen
to
know
that
you
have
made
a
conquest
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Cake
,
she
ought
to
be
called
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
She
is
very
sweet
.
*NL*
She
is
a
delicious
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
What
can
she
have
said
to
you
?
*NL*
She
is
an
excellent
creature
,
but
we
think
her
rather
dismal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
Newman
answered
presently
,
``
that
I
like
her
because
she
has
*NL*
lived
near
you
so
long
.
Since
your
birth
,
she
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
simply
;
``
she
is
very
faithful
;
I
can
trust
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
never
made
any
reflections
to
this
lady
upon
her
mother
and
*NL*
her
brother
Urbain
;
had
given
no
hint
of
the
impression
they
made
upon
*NL*
him
.
But
,
as
if
she
had
guessed
his
thoughts
,
she
seemed
careful
to
*NL*
avoid
all
occasion
for
making
him
speak
of
them
.
She
never
alluded
to
*NL*
her
mother
's
domestic
decrees
;
she
never
quoted
the
opinions
of
the
*NL*
marquis
.
They
had
talked
,
however
,
of
Valentin
,
and
she
had
made
no
*NL*
secret
of
her
extreme
affection
for
her
younger
brother
.
Newman
listened
*NL*
sometimes
with
a
certain
harmless
jealousy
;
he
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
divert
some
of
her
tender
allusions
to
his
own
credit
.
Once
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
told
him
with
a
little
air
of
triumph
about
something
that
*NL*
Valentin
had
done
which
she
thought
very
much
to
his
honor
.
It
was
a
*NL*
service
he
had
rendered
to
an
old
friend
of
the
family
;
something
more
*NL*
``
serious
''
than
Valentin
was
usually
supposed
capable
of
being
.
Newman
*NL*
said
he
was
glad
to
hear
of
it
,
and
then
began
to
talk
about
something
*NL*
which
lay
upon
his
own
heart
.
Madame
de
Cintre
listened
,
but
after
a
*NL*
while
she
said
,
``
I
do
n't
like
the
way
you
speak
of
my
brother
Valentin
.
''
*NL*
Hereupon
Newman
,
surprised
,
said
that
he
had
never
spoken
of
him
but
*NL*
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
kindly
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
It
is
a
kindness
that
costs
*NL*
nothing
;
it
is
the
kindness
you
show
to
a
child
.
It
is
as
if
you
did
n't
*NL*
respect
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Respect
him
?
Why
I
think
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
?
If
you
are
not
sure
,
it
is
no
respect

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
respect
him
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
If
you
do
,
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
loves
a
person
,
that
is
a
question
one
is
not
bound
to
answer
,
''
*NL*
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
not
have
asked
it
of
me
,
then

I
am
very
fond
of
your
*NL*
brother

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
amuses
you

But
you
would
not

to
resemble
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
like
to
resemble
any
one

It
is
hard
enough
work
resembling
*NL*
one
's
self

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
,
''
asked
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
by
resembling
one
's
self

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
doing
what
is
expected
of
one

Doing
one
's
duty

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
only
when
one
is
very
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
great
many
people
are
good

''
said
Newman
.
``
Valentin
is
quite
*NL*
good
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
was
silent
for
a
short
time
.
``
He
is
not
good
enough
for
*NL*
me
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
``
I
wish
he
would
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
he
do
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Yet
he
is
very
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
proof
of
cleverness
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
to
be
happy
without
doing
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
Valentin
is
happy
,
in
reality
.
He
is
clever
,
generous
,
*NL*
brave
;
but
what
is
there
to
show
for
it
?
To
me
there
is
something
sad
in
*NL*
his
life
,
and
sometimes
I
have
a
sort
of
foreboding
about
him
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
why
,
but
I
fancy
he
will
have
some
great
trouble
--
perhaps
an
*NL*
unhappy
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
leave
him
to
me
,
''
said
Newman
,
jovially
.
``
I
will
watch
over
him
and
*NL*
keep
harm
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
in
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
salon
,
the
conversation
had
*NL*
flagged
most
sensibly
.
The
marquis
walked
up
and
down
in
silence
,
like
a
*NL*
sentinel
at
the
door
of
some
smooth-fronted
citadel
of
the
proprieties
;
*NL*
his
mother
sat
staring
at
the
fire
;
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
worked
at
*NL*
an
enormous
band
of
tapestry
.
Usually
there
were
three
or
four
visitors
,
*NL*
but
on
this
occasion
a
violent
storm
sufficiently
accounted
for
the
*NL*
absence
of
even
the
most
devoted
habitues
.
In
the
long
silences
the
*NL*
howling
of
the
wind
and
the
beating
of
the
rain
were
distinctly
audible
.
*NL*
Newman
sat
perfectly
still
,
watching
the
clock
,
determined
to
stay
till
*NL*
the
stroke
of
eleven
,
but
not
a
moment
longer
.
Madame
de
Cintre
had
*NL*
turned
her
back
to
the
circle
,
and
had
been
standing
for
some
time
*NL*
within
the
uplifted
curtain
of
a
window
,
with
her
forehead
against
the
*NL*
pane
,
gazing
out
into
the
deluged
darkness
.
Suddenly
she
turned
round
*NL*
toward
her
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
''
she
said
,
with
peculiar
eagerness
,
``
go
to
the
piano
*NL*
and
play
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
held
up
her
tapestry
and
pointed
to
a
little
white
*NL*
flower
.
``
Do
n't
ask
me
to
leave
this
.
I
am
in
the
midst
of
a
masterpiece
.
*NL*
My
flower
is
going
to
smell
very
sweet
;
I
am
putting
in
the
smell
with
*NL*
this
gold-colored
silk
.
I
am
holding
my
breath
;
I
ca
n't
leave
off
.
Play
*NL*
something
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
absurd
for
me
to
play
when
you
are
present
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
.
But
the
next
moment
she
went
to
the
piano
and
began
to
*NL*
strike
the
keys
with
vehemence
.
She
played
for
some
time
,
rapidly
and
*NL*
brilliantly
;
when
she
stopped
,
Newman
went
to
the
piano
and
asked
her
*NL*
to
begin
again
.
She
shook
her
head
,
and
,
on
his
insisting
,
she
said
,
``
I
*NL*
have
not
been
playing
for
you
;
I
have
been
playing
for
myself
.
''
She
went
*NL*
back
to
the
window
again
and
looked
out
,
and
shortly
afterwards
left
the
*NL*
room
.
When
Newman
took
leave
,
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
accompanied
him
,
as
*NL*
he
always
did
,
just
three
steps
down
the
staircase
.
At
the
bottom
stood
*NL*
a
servant
with
his
overcoat
.
He
had
just
put
it
on
when
he
saw
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
coming
towards
him
across
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
be
at
home
on
Friday
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
before
answering
his
question
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
like
my
mother
and
my
brother
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
he
said
softly
,
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
hand
on
the
balustrade
and
prepared
to
ascend
the
stairs
,
*NL*
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
first
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
be
at
home
on
Friday
,
''
and
she
passed
up
the
wide
dusky
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Friday
,
as
soon
as
he
came
in
,
she
asked
him
to
please
to
tell
*NL*
her
why
he
disliked
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dislike
your
family
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
That
has
a
horrid
sound
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
say
so
,
did
I
?
I
did
n't

it
,
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
of
any
of
them
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
because
you
dislike
them
.
Speak
the
truth
;
you
ca
n't
offend
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
exactly
love
your
brother
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
remember
now
.
*NL*
But
what
is
the
use
of
my
saying
so
?
I
had
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
good-natured
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
gravely
.
Then
,
as
if
*NL*
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
inviting
him
to
speak
ill
of
the
marquis
,
she
*NL*
turned
away
,
motioning
him
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
remained
standing
before
her
and
said
presently
,
``
What
is
of
much
*NL*
more
importance
is
that
they
do
n't
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
they
do
n't
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
think
they
are
wrong
?
''
Newman
asked
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
*NL*
am
a
man
to
dislike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
that
a
man
who
may
be
liked
may
also
be
disliked
.
And
my
*NL*
brother
--
my
mother
,
''
she
added
,
``
have
not
made
you
angry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
shown
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
much
the
better
.
They
think
they
have
treated
you
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
they
might
have
handled
me
much
more
roughly
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
``
I
am
much
obliged
to
them
.
Honestly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
generous
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
It
's
a
disagreeable
*NL*
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
them
,
you
mean
.
Not
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
their
sins
are
forgiven
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
They
do
n't
think
I
am
*NL*
as
good
as
they
are
.
I
do
.
But
we
sha
n't
quarrel
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
even
agree
with
you
without
saying
something
that
has
a
*NL*
disagreeable
sound
.
The
presumption
was
against
you
.
That
you
probably
*NL*
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
sat
down
and
looked
at
her
for
some
time
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
really
*NL*
understand
it
.
But
when
you
say
it
,
I
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
poor
reason
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
a
very
good
one
.
You
have
a
high
spirit
,
a
high
standard
;
but
*NL*
with
you
it
's
all
natural
and
unaffected
;
you
do
n't
seem
to
have
stuck
*NL*
your
head
into
a
vise
,
as
if
you
were
sitting
for
the
photograph
of
*NL*
propriety
.
You
think
of
me
as
a
fellow
who
has
had
no
idea
in
life
but
*NL*
to
make
money
and
drive
sharp
bargains
.
That
's
a
fair
description
of
me
,
*NL*
but
it
is
not
the
whole
story
.
A
man
ought
to
care
for
something
else
,
*NL*
though
I
do
n't
know
exactly
what
.
I
cared
for
money-making
,
but
I
never
*NL*
cared
particularly
for
the
money
.
There
was
nothing
else
to
do
,
and
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
be
idle
.
I
have
been
very
easy
to
others
,
and
to
*NL*
myself
.
I
have
done
most
of
the
things
that
people
asked
me
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
mean
rascals
.
As
regards
your
mother
and
your
brother
,
''
Newman
added
,
*NL*
``
there
is
only
one
point
upon
which
I
feel
that
I
might
quarrel
with
*NL*
them
.
I
do
n't
ask
them
to
sing
my
praises
to
you
,
but
I
ask
them
to
let
*NL*
you
alone
.
If
I
thought
they
talked
ill
of
me
to
you
,
I
should
come
down
*NL*
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
let
me
alone
,
as
you
say
.
They
have
not
talked
ill
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
cried
Newman
,
``
I
declare
they
are
only
too
good
for
this
*NL*
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
appeared
to
find
something
startling
in
his
*NL*
exclamation
.
She
would
,
perhaps
,
have
replied
,
but
at
this
moment
*NL*
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
stepped
across
the
*NL*
threshold
.
He
appeared
surprised
at
finding
Newman
,
but
his
surprise
*NL*
was
but
a
momentary
shadow
across
the
surface
of
an
unwonted
joviality
.
*NL*
Newman
had
never
seen
the
marquis
so
exhilarated
;
his
pale
,
unlighted
*NL*
countenance
had
a
sort
of
thin
transfiguration
.
He
held
open
the
*NL*
door
for
some
one
else
to
enter
,
and
presently
appeared
old
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
a
gentleman
whom
Newman
had
not
seen
*NL*
before
.
He
had
already
risen
,
and
Madame
de
Cintre
rose
,
as
she
always
*NL*
did
before
her
mother
.
The
marquis
,
who
had
greeted
Newman
almost
*NL*
genially
,
stood
apart
,
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
.
His
mother
came
forward
*NL*
with
her
companion
.
She
gave
a
majestic
little
nod
at
Newman
,
and
then
*NL*
she
released
the
strange
gentleman
,
that
he
might
make
his
bow
to
her
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
have
brought
you
an
unknown
relative
,
Lord
*NL*
Deepmere
.
Lord
Deepmere
is
our
cousin
,
but
he
has
done
only
to-day
what
*NL*
he
ought
to
have
done
long
ago
--
come
to
make
our
acquaintance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
smiled
,
and
offered
Lord
Deepmere
her
hand
.
``
It
is
very
*NL*
extraordinary
,
''
said
this
noble
laggard
,
``
but
this
is
the
first
time
*NL*
that
I
have
ever
been
in
Paris
for
more
than
three
or
four
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
have
you
been
here
now
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
the
last
two
months
,
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
remarks
might
have
constituted
an
impertinence
;
but
a
glance
*NL*
at
Lord
Deepmere
's
face
would
have
satisfied
you
,
as
it
apparently
*NL*
satisfied
Madame
de
Cintre
,
that
they
constituted
only
a
naivete
.
When
*NL*
his
companions
were
seated
,
Newman
,
who
was
out
of
the
conversation
,
*NL*
occupied
himself
with
observing
the
newcomer
.
Observation
,
however
,
*NL*
as
regards
Lord
Deepmere
's
person
;
had
no
great
range
.
He
was
a
small
,
*NL*
meagre
man
,
of
some
three
and
thirty
years
of
age
,
with
a
bald
head
,
*NL*
a
short
nose
and
no
front
teeth
in
the
upper
jaw
;
he
had
round
,
candid
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
and
several
pimples
on
his
chin
.
He
was
evidently
very
shy
,
*NL*
and
he
laughed
a
great
deal
,
catching
his
breath
with
an
odd
,
startling
*NL*
sound
,
as
the
most
convenient
imitation
of
repose
.
His
physiognomy
*NL*
denoted
great
simplicity
,
a
certain
amount
of
brutality
,
and
probable
*NL*
failure
in
the
past
to
profit
by
rare
educational
advantages
.
He
*NL*
remarked
that
Paris
was
awfully
jolly
,
but
that
for
real
,
thorough-paced
*NL*
entertainment
it
was
nothing
to
Dublin
.
He
even
preferred
Dublin
to
*NL*
London
.
Had
Madame
de
Cintre
ever
been
to
Dublin
?
They
must
all
come
*NL*
over
there
some
day
,
and
he
would
show
them
some
Irish
sport
.
He
always
*NL*
went
to
Ireland
for
the
fishing
,
and
he
came
to
Paris
for
the
new
*NL*
Offenbach
things
.
They
always
brought
them
out
in
Dublin
,
but
he
*NL*
could
n't
wait
.
He
had
been
nine
times
to
hear
La
Pomme
de
Paris
.
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
,
leaning
back
,
with
her
arms
folded
,
looked
at
Lord
Deepmere
*NL*
with
a
more
visibly
puzzled
face
than
she
usually
showed
to
society
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
on
the
other
hand
,
wore
a
fixed
smile
.
The
marquis
*NL*
said
that
among
light
operas
his
favorite
was
the
Gazza
Ladra
.
The
*NL*
marquise
then
began
a
series
of
inquiries
about
the
duke
and
the
*NL*
cardinal
,
the
old
countess
and
Lady
Barbara
,
after
listening
to
which
,
*NL*
and
to
Lord
Deepmere
's
somewhat
irreverent
responses
,
for
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
,
Newman
rose
to
take
his
leave
.
The
marquis
went
with
him
three
*NL*
steps
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
Irish
?
''
asked
Newman
,
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
mother
was
the
daughter
of
Lord
Finucane
,
''
said
the
marquis
;
``
he
*NL*
has
great
Irish
estates
.
Lady
Bridget
,
in
the
complete
absence
of
*NL*
male
heirs
,
either
direct
or
collateral
--
a
most
extraordinary
*NL*
circumstance
--
came
in
for
everything
.
But
Lord
Deepmere
's
title
is
*NL*
English
and
his
English
property
is
immense
.
He
is
a
charming
young
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
answered
nothing
,
but
he
detained
the
marquis
as
the
latter
was
*NL*
beginning
gracefully
to
recede
.
``
It
is
a
good
time
for
me
to
thank
you
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
for
sticking
so
punctiliously
to
our
bargain
,
for
doing
so
*NL*
much
to
help
me
on
with
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
stared
.
``
Really
,
I
have
done
nothing
that
I
can
boast
of
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
do
n't
be
modest
,
''
Newman
answered
,
laughing
.
``
I
ca
n't
flatter
myself
*NL*
that
I
am
doing
so
well
simply
by
my
own
merit
.
And
thank
your
mother
*NL*
for
me
,
too
!
''
And
he
turned
away
,
leaving
M.
de
Bellegarde
looking
after
*NL*
him
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
Newman
came
to
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
he
had
the
good
*NL*
fortune
to
find
Madame
de
Cintre
alone
.
He
had
come
with
a
definite
*NL*
intention
,
and
he
lost
no
time
in
executing
it
.
She
wore
,
moreover
,
a
*NL*
look
which
he
eagerly
interpreted
as
expectancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
coming
to
see
you
for
six
months
,
now
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
*NL*
have
never
spoken
to
you
a
second
time
of
marriage
.
That
was
what
you
*NL*
asked
me
;
I
obeyed
.
Could
any
man
have
done
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
acted
with
great
delicacy
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
going
to
change
,
now
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
am
*NL*
going
to
be
indelicate
;
but
I
'm
going
to
go
back
to
where
I
began
.
I
AM
*NL*
back
there
.
I
have
been
all
round
the
circle
.
Or
rather
,
I
have
never
*NL*
been
away
from
here
.
I
have
never
ceased
to
want
what
I
wanted
then
.
*NL*
Only
now
I
am
more
sure
of
it
,
if
possible
;
I
am
more
sure
of
myself
,
*NL*
and
more
sure
of
you
.
I
know
you
better
,
though
I
do
n't
know
anything
*NL*
I
did
n't
believe
three
months
ago
.
You
are
everything
--
you
are
beyond
*NL*
everything
--
I
can
imagine
or
desire
.
You
know
me
now
;
you
MUST
know
me
.
*NL*
I
wo
n't
say
that
you
have
seen
the
best
--
but
you
have
seen
the
worst
.
*NL*
I
hope
you
have
been
thinking
all
this
while
.
You
must
have
seen
that
I
*NL*
was
only
waiting
;
you
ca
n't
suppose
that
I
was
changing
.
What
will
you
*NL*
say
to
me
,
now
?
Say
that
everything
is
clear
and
reasonable
,
and
that
I
*NL*
have
been
very
patient
and
considerate
,
and
deserve
my
reward
.
And
then
*NL*
give
me
your
hand
.
Madame
de
Cintre
do
that
.
Do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
were
only
waiting
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
I
was
very
sure
this
day
*NL*
would
come
.
I
have
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
.
At
first
I
was
half
*NL*
afraid
of
it
.
But
I
am
not
afraid
of
it
now
.
''
She
paused
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
she
added
,
``
It
's
a
relief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
on
a
low
chair
,
and
Newman
was
on
an
ottoman
,
near
her
.
*NL*
He
leaned
a
little
and
took
her
hand
,
which
for
an
instant
she
let
him
*NL*
keep
.
``
That
means
that
I
have
not
waited
for
nothing
,
''
he
said
.
She
*NL*
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
,
and
he
saw
her
eyes
fill
with
tears
.
``
With
*NL*
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
you
will
be
as
safe
--
as
safe
''
--
and
even
in
his
ardor
*NL*
he
hesitated
a
moment
for
a
comparison
--
``
as
safe
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
simple
solemnity
,
``
as
in
your
father
's
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
looked
at
him
and
her
tears
increased
.
Then
,
abruptly
,
she
*NL*
buried
her
face
on
the
cushioned
arm
of
the
sofa
beside
her
chair
,
and
*NL*
broke
into
noiseless
sobs
.
``
I
am
weak
--
I
am
weak
,
''
he
heard
her
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
more
reason
why
you
should
give
yourself
up
to
me
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
``
Why
are
you
troubled
?
There
is
nothing
but
happiness
.
Is
that
*NL*
so
hard
to
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
everything
seems
so
simple
,
''
she
said
,
raising
her
head
.
``
But
*NL*
things
are
not
so
.
I
like
you
extremely
.
I
liked
you
six
months
ago
,
and
*NL*
now
I
am
sure
of
it
,
as
you
say
you
are
sure
.
But
it
is
not
easy
,
simply
*NL*
for
that
,
to
decide
to
marry
you
.
There
are
a
great
many
things
to
think
*NL*
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
ought
to
be
only
one
thing
to
think
about
--
that
we
love
each
*NL*
other
,
''
said
Newman
.
And
as
she
remained
silent
he
quickly
added
,
``
Very
*NL*
good
,
if
you
ca
n't
accept
that
,
do
n't
tell
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
glad
to
think
of
nothing
,
''
she
said
at
last
;
``
not
to
*NL*
think
at
all
;
only
to
shut
both
my
eyes
and
give
myself
up
.
But
I
ca
n't
.
*NL*
I
'm
cold
,
I
'm
old
,
I
'm
a
coward
;
I
never
supposed
I
should
marry
again
,
*NL*
and
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
I
should
ever
have
listened
to
you
.
*NL*
When
I
used
to
think
,
as
a
girl
,
of
what
I
should
do
if
I
were
to
marry
*NL*
freely
,
by
my
own
choice
,
I
thought
of
a
very
different
man
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nothing
against
me
,
''
said
Newman
with
an
immense
smile
;
``
your
*NL*
taste
was
not
formed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
smile
made
Madame
de
Cintre
smile
.
``
Have
you
formed
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
And
then
she
said
,
in
a
different
tone
,
``
Where
do
you
wish
to
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anywhere
in
the
wide
world
you
like
.
We
can
easily
settle
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
I
ask
you
,
''
she
presently
continued
.
``
I
care
very
*NL*
little
.
I
think
if
I
were
to
marry
you
I
could
live
almost
anywhere
.
*NL*
You
have
some
false
ideas
about
me
;
you
think
that
I
need
a
great
many
*NL*
things
--
that
I
must
have
a
brilliant
,
worldly
life
.
I
am
sure
you
are
*NL*
prepared
to
take
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
give
me
such
things
.
But
*NL*
that
is
very
arbitrary
;
I
have
done
nothing
to
prove
that
.
''
She
paused
*NL*
again
,
looking
at
him
,
and
her
mingled
sound
and
silence
were
so
sweet
*NL*
to
him
that
he
had
no
wish
to
hurry
her
,
any
more
than
he
would
have
*NL*
had
a
wish
to
hurry
a
golden
sunrise
.
``
Your
being
so
different
,
which
*NL*
at
first
seemed
a
difficulty
,
a
trouble
,
began
one
day
to
seem
to
me
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
a
great
pleasure
.
I
was
glad
you
were
different
.
And
yet
if
I
*NL*
had
said
so
,
no
one
would
have
understood
me
;
I
do
n't
mean
simply
to
my
*NL*
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
have
said
I
was
a
queer
monster
,
eh
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
have
said
I
could
never
be
happy
with
you
--
you
were
too
*NL*
different
;
and
I
would
have
said
it
was
just
BECAUSE
you
were
so
*NL*
different
that
I
might
be
happy
.
But
they
would
have
given
better
*NL*
reasons
than
I.
My
only
reason
''
--
and
she
paused
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
,
in
the
midst
of
his
golden
sunrise
,
Newman
felt
the
*NL*
impulse
to
grasp
at
a
rosy
cloud
.
``
Your
only
reason
is
that
you
love
*NL*
me
!
''
he
murmured
with
an
eloquent
gesture
,
and
for
want
of
a
better
*NL*
reason
Madame
de
Cintre
reconciled
herself
to
this
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
came
back
the
next
day
,
and
in
the
vestibule
,
as
he
entered
the
*NL*
house
,
he
encountered
his
friend
Mrs.
Bread
.
She
was
wandering
about
in
*NL*
honorable
idleness
,
and
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
she
delivered
him
*NL*
one
of
her
curtsies
.
Then
turning
to
the
servant
who
had
admitted
him
,
*NL*
she
said
,
with
the
combined
majesty
of
her
native
superiority
and
of
*NL*
a
rugged
English
accent
,
``
You
may
retire
;
I
will
have
the
honor
of
*NL*
conducting
monsieur
.
''
In
spite
of
this
combination
,
however
,
it
appeared
*NL*
to
Newman
that
her
voice
had
a
slight
quaver
,
as
if
the
tone
of
command
*NL*
were
not
habitual
to
it
.
The
man
gave
her
an
impertinent
stare
,
but
he
*NL*
walked
slowly
away
,
and
she
led
Newman
up-stairs
.
At
half
its
course
the
*NL*
staircase
gave
a
bend
,
forming
a
little
platform
.
In
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
wall
stood
an
indifferent
statue
of
an
eighteenth-century
nymph
,
*NL*
simpering
,
sallow
,
and
cracked
.
Here
Mrs.
Bread
stopped
and
looked
with
*NL*
shy
kindness
at
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
the
good
news
,
sir
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
good
right
to
be
first
to
know
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
have
*NL*
taken
such
a
friendly
interest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
turned
away
and
began
to
blow
the
dust
off
the
statue
,
as
if
*NL*
this
might
be
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
want
to
congratulate
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
am
greatly
*NL*
obliged
.
''
And
then
he
added
,
``
You
gave
me
much
pleasure
the
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
around
,
apparently
reassured
.
``
You
are
not
to
think
that
I
*NL*
have
been
told
anything
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
have
only
guessed
.
But
when
I
*NL*
looked
at
you
,
as
you
came
in
,
I
was
sure
I
had
guessed
aright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
sharp
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
am
sure
that
in
your
quiet
way
you
*NL*
see
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
a
fool
,
sir
,
thank
God
.
I
have
guessed
something
else
beside
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
tell
you
that
,
sir
;
I
do
n't
think
you
would
believe
it
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
it
would
n't
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
tell
me
nothing
but
what
will
please
me
,
''
laughed
Newman
.
``
That
is
*NL*
the
way
you
began
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
suppose
you
wo
n't
be
vexed
to
hear
that
the
sooner
*NL*
everything
is
over
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sooner
we
are
married
,
you
mean
?
The
better
for
me
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
better
for
every
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
better
for
you
,
perhaps
.
You
know
you
are
coming
to
live
with
us
,
''
*NL*
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
extremely
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
but
it
is
not
of
myself
I
was
*NL*
thinking
.
I
only
wanted
,
if
I
might
take
the
liberty
,
to
recommend
you
*NL*
to
lose
no
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
are
you
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
looked
up
the
staircase
and
then
down
and
then
she
looked
at
*NL*
the
undusted
nymph
,
as
if
she
possibly
had
sentient
ears
.
``
I
am
afraid
*NL*
of
every
one
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
uncomfortable
state
of
mind
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
Does
`
every
one
'
*NL*
wish
to
prevent
my
marriage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
of
already
having
said
too
much
,
''
Mrs.
Bread
replied
.
``
I
*NL*
wo
n't
take
it
back
,
but
I
wo
n't
say
any
more
.
''
And
she
took
her
way
up
*NL*
the
staircase
again
and
led
him
into
Madame
de
Cintre
's
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
indulged
in
a
brief
and
silent
imprecation
when
he
found
that
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
was
not
alone
.
With
her
sat
her
mother
,
and
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
stood
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
in
her
bonnet
and
*NL*
mantle
.
The
old
marquise
,
who
was
leaning
back
in
her
chair
with
a
hand
*NL*
clasping
the
knob
of
each
arm
,
looked
at
him
fixedly
without
moving
.
*NL*
She
seemed
barely
conscious
of
his
greeting
;
she
appeared
to
be
musing
*NL*
intently
.
Newman
said
to
himself
that
her
daughter
had
been
announcing
*NL*
her
engagement
and
that
the
old
lady
found
the
morsel
hard
to
swallow
.
*NL*
But
Madame
de
Cintre
,
as
she
gave
him
her
hand
gave
him
also
a
look
by
*NL*
which
she
appeared
to
mean
that
he
should
understand
something
.
Was
it
*NL*
a
warning
or
a
request
?
Did
she
wish
to
enjoin
speech
or
silence
?
He
*NL*
was
puzzled
,
and
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
pretty
grin
gave
him
no
*NL*
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
told
my
mother
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
abruptly
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Told
me
what
?
''
demanded
the
marquise
.
``
You
tell
me
too
little
;
you
*NL*
should
tell
me
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
do
,
''
said
Madame
Urbain
,
with
a
little
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
ME
tell
your
mother
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
stared
at
him
again
,
and
then
turned
to
her
daughter
.
``
You
*NL*
are
going
to
marry
him
?
''
she
cried
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oui
ma
mere
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
daughter
has
consented
,
to
my
great
happiness
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
was
this
arrangement
made
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
I
*NL*
seem
to
be
picking
up
the
news
by
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
suspense
came
to
an
end
yesterday
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
was
mine
to
have
lasted
?
''
said
the
marquise
to
her
*NL*
daughter
.
She
spoke
without
irritation
;
with
a
sort
of
cold
,
noble
*NL*
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
stood
silent
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
.
``
It
is
over
*NL*
now
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
my
son
--
where
is
Urbain
?
''
asked
the
marquise
.
``
Send
for
your
*NL*
brother
and
inform
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
laid
her
hand
on
the
bell-rope
.
``
He
was
to
*NL*
make
some
visits
with
me
,
and
I
was
to
go
and
knock
--
very
softly
,
very
*NL*
softly
--
at
the
door
of
his
study
.
But
he
can
come
to
me
!
''
She
pulled
*NL*
the
bell
,
and
in
a
few
moments
Mrs.
Bread
appeared
,
with
a
face
of
calm
*NL*
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
for
your
brother
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Newman
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
speak
,
and
to
speak
in
a
*NL*
certain
way
.
``
Tell
the
marquis
we
want
him
,
''
he
said
to
Mrs.
Bread
,
who
*NL*
quietly
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
went
to
her
sister-in-law
and
embraced
her
.
*NL*
Then
she
turned
to
Newman
,
with
an
intense
smile
.
``
She
is
charming
.
I
*NL*
congratulate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
congratulate
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
with
extreme
*NL*
solemnity
.
``
My
daughter
is
an
extraordinarily
good
woman
.
She
may
have
*NL*
faults
,
but
I
do
n't
know
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
does
not
often
make
jokes

said
Madame
de
Cintre
;
``
but
when
*NL*
she
does
they
are
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
ravishing

''
the
Marquise
Urbain
resumed
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
.
``
Yes
,
I
congratulate
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
turned
away
,
and
,
taking
up
a
piece
of
tapestry
,
*NL*
began
to
ply
the
needle
.
Some
minutes
of
silence
elapsed
,
which
were
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
He
came
in
with
his
*NL*
hat
in
his
hand
,
gloved
,
and
was
followed
by
his
brother
Valentin
,
who
*NL*
appeared
to
have
just
entered
the
house
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
around
*NL*
the
circle
and
greeted
Newman
with
his
usual
finely-measured
courtesy
.
*NL*
Valentin
saluted
his
mother
and
his
sisters
,
and
,
as
he
shook
hands
with
*NL*
Newman
,
gave
him
a
glance
of
acute
interrogation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arrivez
donc
,
messieurs
!
''
cried
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
We
have
*NL*
great
news
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
your
brother
,
my
daughter

''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
had
been
looking
at
her
tapestry
.
She
raised
her
eyes
*NL*
to
her
brother
.
``
I
have
accepted
Mr.
Newman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
has
consented
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
see
after
all
,
I
knew
*NL*
what
I
was
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
charmed
!
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
with
superior
benignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
,
''
said
Valentin
to
Newman
.
``
The
marquis
and
I
are
charmed

I

I

I
ca

applaud
a
clever
acrobat

My

your

*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
stood
looking
for
a
while
into
the
crown
of
his
hat
.
``
We
*NL*
have
been
prepared
,
''
he
said
at
last
``
but
it
is
inevitable
that
in
face
*NL*
of
the
event
one
should
experience
a
certain
emotion

And
he
gave
a
*NL*
most
unhilarious
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
no
emotion
that
I
was
not
perfectly
prepared

his
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
that
for
myself
,
''
said
Newman
,
smiling
but
differently
from
*NL*
the
marquis
.
``
I
am
happier
than
I
expected
to
be
.
I
suppose
it
's
the
*NL*
sight
of
your
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
exaggerate
that
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
laying
her
hand
upon
her
daughter
's
arm
.
``
You
ca
n't
expect
an
honest
old
*NL*
woman
to
thank
you
for
taking
away
her
beautiful
,
only
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forgot
me
,
dear
madame
,
''
said
the
young
marquise
demurely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
very
beautiful
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
is
the
wedding
,
pray
?
''
asked
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
;
``
I
*NL*
must
have
a
month
to
think
over
a
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
discussed
,
''
said
the
marquise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
will
discuss
it
,
and
let
you
know
!
''
Newman
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
we
shall
agree
,
''
said
Urbain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
agree
with
Madame
de
Cintre
,
you
will
be
very
*NL*
unreasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Urbain
,
''
said
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
I
must
go
*NL*
straight
to
my
tailor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
had
been
standing
with
her
hand
on
her
daughter
's
arm
,
*NL*
looking
at
her
fixedly
.
She
gave
a
little
sigh
,
and
murmured
,
``
No
,
I
did
*NL*
NOT
expect
it
!
You
are
a
fortunate
man
,
''
she
added
,
turning
to
Newman
,
*NL*
with
an
expressive
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
that
!
''
he
answered
.
``
I
feel
tremendously
proud
.
I
feel
like
*NL*
crying
it
on
the
housetops
,
--
like
stopping
people
in
the
street
to
tell
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
narrowed
her
lips
.
``
Pray
do
n't
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
people
that
know
it
,
the
better
,
''
Newman
declared
.
``
I
have
n't
*NL*
yet
announced
it
here
,
but
I
telegraphed
it
this
morning
to
America

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Telegraphed
it
to
America
?
''
the
old
lady
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
New
York
,
to
St.
Louis
,
and
to
San
Francisco
;
those
are
the
*NL*
principal
cities

you
know
.
To-morrow
I
shall
tell
my
friends
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
many
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
in
a
tone
of
which
I
am
*NL*
afraid
that
Newman
but
partly
measured
the
impertinence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
to
bring
me
a
great
many
hand-shakes
and
congratulations
.
To
*NL*
say
nothing
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
moment
,
``
of
those
I
shall
receive
from
your
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
not
use
the
telegraph
,
''
said
the
marquise
,
taking
her
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
whose
wife
,
her
imagination
having
apparently
taken
*NL*
flight
to
the
tailor
's
,
was
fluttering
her
silken
wings
in
emulation
,
*NL*
shook
hands
with
Newman
,
and
said
with
a
more
persuasive
accent
than
the
*NL*
latter
had
ever
heard
him
use
,
``
You
may
count
upon
me
.
''
Then
his
wife
*NL*
led
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
stood
looking
from
his
sister
to
our
hero
.
``
I
hope
you
both
*NL*
reflected
seriously
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
smiled
.
``
We
have
neither
your
powers
of
reflection
nor
*NL*
your
depth
of
seriousness
;
but
we
have
done
our
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
a
great
regard
for
each
of
you
,
''
Valentin
continued
.
``
You
*NL*
are
charming
young
people
.
But
I
am
not
satisfied
,
on
the
whole
,
that
*NL*
you
belong
to
that
small
and
superior
class
--
that
exquisite
group
*NL*
composed
of
persons
who
are
worthy
to
remain
unmarried
.
These
are
rare
*NL*
souls
;
they
are
the
salt
of
the
earth
.
But
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
invidious
;
*NL*
the
marrying
people
are
often
very
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentin
holds
that
women
should
marry
,
and
that
men
should
not
,
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
he
arranges
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
arrange
it
by
adoring
you
,
my
sister
,
''
said
Valentin
ardently
.
*NL*
``
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adore
some
one
whom
you
can
marry
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
will
arrange
that
*NL*
for
you
some
day
.
I
foresee
that
I
am
going
to
turn
apostle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
was
on
the
threshold
;
he
looked
back
a
moment
with
a
face
that
*NL*
had
turned
grave
.
``
I
adore
some
one
I
ca
n't
marry
!
''
he
said
.
And
he
*NL*
dropped
the
portiere
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
like
it
,
''
said
Newman
,
standing
alone
before
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
moment
;
``
they
do
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
do
you
mind
that
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
said
,
after
another
interval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
should
prefer
that
my
mother
were
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
the
deuce
,
''
demanded
Newman
,
``
is
she
not
pleased
?
She
gave
you
*NL*
leave
to
marry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
;
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
And
yet
I
do
`
mind
it
,
'
as
you
say
.
*NL*
You
will
call
it
superstitious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
depend
upon
how
much
you
let
it
bother
you
.
Then
I
shall
call
*NL*
it
an
awful
bore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
keep
it
to
myself
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
It
shall
not
bother
*NL*
you
.
''
And
then
they
talked
of
their
marriage-day
,
and
Madame
de
Cintre
*NL*
assented
unreservedly
to
Newman
's
desire
to
have
it
fixed
for
an
early
*NL*
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
's
telegrams
were
answered
with
interest
.
Having
dispatched
but
*NL*
three
electric
missives
,
he
received
no
less
than
eight
gratulatory
*NL*
bulletins
in
return
.
He
put
them
into
his
pocket-book
,
and
the
next
time
*NL*
he
encountered
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
drew
them
forth
and
displayed
*NL*
them
to
her
.
This
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
was
a
slightly
malicious
*NL*
stroke
;
the
reader
must
judge
in
what
degree
the
offense
was
venial
.
*NL*
Newman
knew
that
the
marquise
disliked
his
telegrams
,
though
he
could
*NL*
see
no
sufficient
reason
for
it
.
Madame
de
Cintre
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
liked
them
,
and
,
most
of
them
being
of
a
humorous
cast
,
laughed
at
them
*NL*
immoderately
,
and
inquired
into
the
character
of
their
authors
.
Newman
,
*NL*
now
that
his
prize
was
gained
,
felt
a
peculiar
desire
that
his
triumph
*NL*
should
be
manifest
.
He
more
than
suspected
that
the
Bellegardes
were
*NL*
keeping
quiet
about
it
,
and
allowing
it
,
in
their
select
circle
,
but
a
*NL*
limited
resonance
;
and
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
if
he
were
to
take
*NL*
the
trouble
he
might
,
as
he
phrased
it
,
break
all
the
windows
.
No
man
*NL*
likes
being
repudiated
,
and
yet
Newman
,
if
he
was
not
flattered
,
was
*NL*
not
exactly
offended
.
He
had
not
this
good
excuse
for
his
somewhat
*NL*
aggressive
impulse
to
promulgate
his
felicity
;
his
sentiment
was
of
*NL*
another
quality
.
He
wanted
for
once
to
make
the
heads
of
the
house
of
*NL*
Bellegarde
FEEL
him
;
he
knew
not
when
he
should
have
another
chance
.
*NL*
He
had
had
for
the
past
six
months
a
sense
of
the
old
lady
and
her
son
*NL*
looking
straight
over
his
head
,
and
he
was
now
resolved
that
they
should
*NL*
toe
a
mark
which
he
would
give
himself
the
satisfaction
of
drawing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
seeing
a
bottle
emptied
when
the
wine
is
poured
too
slowly
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
Mrs.
Tristram
.
``
They
make
me
want
to
joggle
their
elbows
and
*NL*
force
them
to
spill
their
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Mrs.
Tristram
answered
that
he
had
better
leave
them
alone
*NL*
and
let
them
do
things
in
their
own
way
.
``
You
must
make
allowances
for
*NL*
them
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
is
natural
enough
that
they
should
hang
fire
a
*NL*
little
.
They
thought
they
accepted
you
when
you
made
your
application
;
*NL*
but
they
are
not
people
of
imagination
,
they
could
not
project
*NL*
themselves
into
the
future
,
and
now
they
will
have
to
begin
again
.
But
*NL*
they
are
people
of
honor
,
and
they
will
do
whatever
is
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
spent
a
few
moments
in
narrow-eyed
meditation
.
``
I
am
not
hard
on
*NL*
them
,
''
he
presently
said
,
``
and
to
prove
it
I
will
invite
them
all
to
a
*NL*
festival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
a
festival
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
laughing
at
my
great
gilded
rooms
all
winter
;
I
will
show
*NL*
you
that
they
are
good
for
something
.
I
will
give
a
party
.
What
is
the
*NL*
grandest
thing
one
can
do
here
?
I
will
hire
all
the
great
singers
from
*NL*
the
opera
,
and
all
the
first
people
from
the
Theatre
Francais
,
and
I
*NL*
will
give
an
entertainment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whom
will
you
invite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
first
of
all
.
And
then
the
old
lady
and
her
son
.
And
then
every
*NL*
one
among
her
friends
whom
I
have
met
at
her
house
or
elsewhere
,
every
*NL*
one
who
has
shown
me
the
minimum
of
politeness
,
every
duke
of
them
and
*NL*
his
wife

And
then
all
my
friends
,
without
exception
:
Miss
Kitty
Upjohn
,
*NL*
Miss
Dora
Finch
,
General
Packard
,
C.
P
Hatch
,
and
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
And
every
one
shall
know
what
it
is
about
,
that
is
,
to
celebrate
my
*NL*
engagement
to
the
Countess
de
Cintre
.
What
do
you
think
of
the
idea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
odious
!
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
And
then
in
a
moment
:
``
I
*NL*
think
it
is
delicious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
evening
Newman
repaired
to
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
salon
.
*NL*
where
he
found
her
surrounded
by
her
children
,
and
invited
her
to
honor
*NL*
his
poor
dwelling
by
her
presence
on
a
certain
evening
a
fortnight
*NL*
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
stared
a
moment
.
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
she
cried
,
``
what
do
you
*NL*
want
to
do
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
make
you
acquainted
with
a
few
people
,
and
then
to
place
you
in
a
*NL*
very
easy
chair
and
ask
you
to
listen
to
Madame
Frezzolini
's
singing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
give
a
concert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
have
a
crowd
of
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
my
friends
,
and
I
hope
some
of
yours
and
your
daughter
's

I
want
to
*NL*
celebrate
my
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Newman
that
Madame
de
Bellegarde
turned
pale
.
She
opened
*NL*
her
fan
,
a
fine
old
painted
fan
of
the
last
century
,
and
looked
at
*NL*
the
picture
,
which
represented
a
fete
champetre
--
a
lady
with
a
guitar
,
*NL*
singing
,
and
a
group
of
dancers
round
a
garlanded
Hermes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
go
out
so
little
,
''
murmured
the
marquis
,
``
since
my
poor
father
's
*NL*
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
MY
dear
father
is
still
alive
,
my
friend
,
''
said
his
wife
.
``
I
am
*NL*
only
waiting
for
my
invitation
to
accept
it
,
''
and
she
glanced
with
*NL*
amiable
confidence
at
Newman
.
``
It
will
be
magnificent
;
I
am
very
sure
of
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
to
the
discredit
of
Newman
's
gallantry
,
that
this
*NL*
lady
's
invitation
was
not
then
and
there
bestowed
;
he
was
giving
all
his
*NL*
attention
to
the
old
marquise
.
She
looked
up
at
last
,
smiling
.
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
think
of
letting
you
offer
me
a
fete
,
''
she
said
,
``
until
I
have
offered
*NL*
you
one
.
We
want
to
present
you
to
our
friends
;
we
will
invite
them
all
.
*NL*
We
have
it
very
much
at
heart
.
We
must
do
things
in
order
.
Come
to
me
*NL*
about
the
25th
;
I
will
let
you
know
the
exact
day
immediately
.
We
shall
*NL*
not
have
any
one
so
fine
as
Madame
Frezzolini
,
but
we
shall
have
some
*NL*
very
good
people
.
After
that
you
may
talk
of
your
own
fete
.
''
The
old
*NL*
lady
spoke
with
a
certain
quick
eagerness
,
smiling
more
agreeably
as
she
*NL*
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Newman
a
handsome
proposal
,
and
such
proposals
always
*NL*
touched
the
sources
of
his
good-nature
.
He
said
to
Madame
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
that
he
should
be
glad
to
come
on
the
25th
or
any
other
day
,
and
that
it
*NL*
mattered
very
little
whether
he
met
his
friends
at
her
house
or
at
his
*NL*
own
.
I
have
said
that
Newman
was
observant
,
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
*NL*
on
this
occasion
he
failed
to
notice
a
certain
delicate
glance
which
*NL*
passed
between
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
the
marquis
,
and
which
we
may
*NL*
presume
to
have
been
a
commentary
upon
the
innocence
displayed
in
that
*NL*
latter
clause
of
his
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
walked
away
with
Newman
that
evening
,
and
when
*NL*
they
had
left
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
some
distance
behind
them
he
said
*NL*
reflectively
,
``
My
mother
is
very
strong
--
very
strong
.
''
Then
in
answer
to
*NL*
an
interrogative
movement
of
Newman
's
he
continued
,
``
She
was
driven
to
*NL*
the
wall
,
but
you
would
never
have
thought
it
.
Her
fete
of
the
25th
was
*NL*
an
invention
of
the
moment
.
She
had
no
idea
whatever
of
giving
a
fete
,
*NL*
but
finding
it
the
only
issue
from
your
proposal
,
she
looked
straight
*NL*
at
the
dose
--
excuse
the
expression
--
and
bolted
it
,
as
you
saw
,
without
*NL*
winking
.
She
is
very
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
said
Newman
,
divided
between
relish
and
compassion
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
a
straw
for
her
fete
,
I
am
willing
to
take
the
will
for
the
deed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Valentin
,
with
a
little
inconsequent
touch
of
family
*NL*
pride
.
``
The
thing
will
be
done
now
,
and
done
handsomely
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
's
announcement
of
the
secession
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
from
her
father
's
domicile
and
his
irreverent
reflections
upon
*NL*
the
attitude
of
this
anxious
parent
in
so
grave
a
catastrophe
,
received
*NL*
a
practical
commentary
in
the
fact
that
M.
Nioche
was
slow
to
seek
*NL*
another
interview
with
his
late
pupil
.
It
had
cost
Newman
some
disgust
*NL*
to
be
forced
to
assent
to
Valentin
's
somewhat
cynical
interpretation
of
*NL*
the
old
man
's
philosophy
,
and
,
though
circumstances
seemed
to
indicate
*NL*
that
he
had
not
given
himself
up
to
a
noble
despair
,
Newman
thought
it
*NL*
very
possible
he
might
be
suffering
more
keenly
than
was
apparent
.
M.
*NL*
Nioche
had
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
him
a
respectful
little
visit
*NL*
every
two
or
three
weeks
and
his
absence
might
be
a
proof
quite
as
much
*NL*
of
extreme
depression
as
of
a
desire
to
conceal
the
success
with
which
*NL*
he
had
patched
up
his
sorrow
.
Newman
presently
learned
from
Valentin
*NL*
several
details
touching
this
new
phase
of
Mademoiselle
Noemie
's
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
she
was
remarkable
,
''
this
unshrinking
observer
declared
,
*NL*
``
and
the
way
she
has
managed
this
performance
proves
it
.
She
has
had
*NL*
other
chances
,
but
she
was
resolved
to
take
none
but
the
best
.
She
did
*NL*
you
the
honor
to
think
for
a
while
that
you
might
be
such
a
chance
.
You
*NL*
were
not
;
so
she
gathered
up
her
patience
and
waited
a
while
longer
.
At
*NL*
last
her
occasion
came
along
,
and
she
made
her
move
with
her
eyes
wide
*NL*
open
.
I
am
very
sure
she
had
no
innocence
to
lose
,
but
she
had
all
her
*NL*
respectability
.
Dubious
little
damsel
as
you
thought
her
,
she
had
kept
*NL*
a
firm
hold
of
that
;
nothing
could
be
proved
against
her
,
and
she
was
*NL*
determined
not
to
let
her
reputation
go
till
she
had
got
her
equivalent
.
*NL*
About
her
equivalent
she
had
high
ideas
.
Apparently
her
ideal
has
been
*NL*
satisfied
.
It
is
fifty
years
old
,
bald-headed
,
and
deaf
,
but
it
is
very
*NL*
easy
about
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
in
the
world
,
''
asked
Newman
,
``
did
you
pick
up
this
valuable
*NL*
information
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
conversation
.
Remember
my
frivolous
habits
.
In
conversation
with
a
*NL*
young
woman
engaged
in
the
humble
trade
of
glove-cleaner
,
who
keeps
a
*NL*
small
shop
in
the
Rue
St.
Roch
.
M.
Nioche
lives
in
the
same
house
,
up
*NL*
six
pair
of
stairs
,
across
the
court
,
in
and
out
of
whose
ill-swept
*NL*
doorway
Miss
Noemie
has
been
flitting
for
the
last
five
years
.
The
*NL*
little
glove-cleaner
was
an
old
acquaintance
;
she
used
to
be
the
friend
*NL*
of
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
has
married
and
dropped
such
friends
.
I
often
*NL*
saw
her
in
his
society
.
As
soon
as
I
espied
her
behind
her
clear
little
*NL*
window-pane
,
I
recollected
her
.
I
had
on
a
spotlessly
fresh
pair
of
*NL*
gloves
,
but
I
went
in
and
held
up
my
hands
,
and
said
to
her
,
`
Dear
*NL*
mademoiselle
,
what
will
you
ask
me
for
cleaning
these
?
'
`
Dear
count
,
'
*NL*
she
answered
immediately
,
'
I
will
clean
them
for
you
for
nothing
.
'
She
*NL*
had
instantly
recognized
me
,
and
I
had
to
hear
her
history
for
the
last
*NL*
six
years
.
But
after
that
,
I
put
her
upon
that
of
her
neighbors
.
She
*NL*
knows
and
admires
Noemie
,
and
she
told
me
what
I
have
just
repeated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
elapsed
without
M.
Nioche
reappearing
,
and
Newman
,
who
every
*NL*
morning
read
two
or
three
suicides
in
the
``
Figaro
,
''
began
to
suspect
*NL*
that
,
mortification
proving
stubborn
,
he
had
sought
a
balm
for
his
*NL*
wounded
pride
in
the
waters
of
the
Seine
.
He
had
a
note
of
M.
Nioche
's
*NL*
address
in
his
pocket-book
,
and
finding
himself
one
day
in
the
quartier
,
*NL*
he
determined
in
so
far
as
he
might
to
clear
up
his
doubts
.
He
repaired
*NL*
to
the
house
in
the
Rue
St.
Roch
which
bore
the
recorded
number
,
and
*NL*
observed
in
a
neighboring
basement
,
behind
a
dangling
row
of
neatly
*NL*
inflated
gloves
,
the
attentive
physiognomy
of
Bellegarde
's
informant
--
a
*NL*
sallow
person
in
a
dressing-gown
--
peering
into
the
street
as
if
she
were
*NL*
expecting
that
amiable
nobleman
to
pass
again
.
But
it
was
not
to
her
*NL*
that
Newman
applied
;
he
simply
asked
of
the
portress
if
M.
Nioche
were
*NL*
at
home
.
The
portress
replied
,
as
the
portress
invariably
replies
,
that
*NL*
her
lodger
had
gone
out
barely
three
minutes
before
;
but
then
,
through
*NL*
the
little
square
hole
of
her
lodge-window
taking
the
measure
of
*NL*
Newman
's
fortunes
,
and
seeing
them
,
by
an
unspecified
process
,
refresh
*NL*
the
dry
places
of
servitude
to
occupants
of
fifth
floors
on
courts
,
she
*NL*
added
that
M.
Nioche
would
have
had
just
time
to
reach
the
Cafe
de
la
*NL*
Patrie
,
round
the
second
corner
to
the
left
,
at
which
establishment
he
*NL*
regularly
spent
his
afternoons
.
Newman
thanked
her
for
the
information
,
*NL*
took
the
second
turning
to
the
left
,
and
arrived
at
the
Cafe
de
la
*NL*
Patrie
.
He
felt
a
momentary
hesitation
to
go
in
;
was
it
not
rather
mean
*NL*
to
``
follow
up
''
poor
old
Nioche
at
that
rate
?
But
there
passed
across
his
*NL*
vision
an
image
of
a
haggard
little
septuagenarian
taking
measured
sips
*NL*
of
a
glass
of
sugar
and
water
and
finding
them
quite
impotent
to
sweeten
*NL*
his
desolation
.
He
opened
the
door
and
entered
,
perceiving
nothing
at
*NL*
first
but
a
dense
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
.
Across
this
,
however
,
in
a
*NL*
corner
,
he
presently
descried
the
figure
of
M.
Nioche
,
stirring
the
*NL*
contents
of
a
deep
glass
,
with
a
lady
seated
in
front
of
him
.
The
*NL*
lady
's
back
was
turned
to
Newman
,
but
M.
Nioche
very
soon
perceived
and
*NL*
recognized
his
visitor
.
Newman
had
gone
toward
him
,
and
the
old
man
rose
*NL*
slowly
,
gazing
at
him
with
a
more
blighted
expression
even
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
drinking
hot
punch
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
suppose
you
are
not
*NL*
dead
.
That
's
all
right
.
Do
n't
move
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
stood
staring
,
with
a
fallen
jaw
,
not
daring
to
put
out
*NL*
his
hand
.
The
lady
,
who
sat
facing
him
,
turned
round
in
her
place
*NL*
and
glanced
upward
with
a
spirited
toss
of
her
head
,
displaying
the
*NL*
agreeable
features
of
his
daughter
.
She
looked
at
Newman
sharply
,
to
see
*NL*
how
he
was
looking
at
her
,
then
--
I
do
n't
know
what
she
discovered
--
she
*NL*
said
graciously
,
``
How
d'
ye
do
,
monsieur
?
wo
n't
you
come
into
our
little
*NL*
corner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
come
--
did
you
come
after
ME
?
''
asked
M.
Nioche
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
your
house
to
see
what
had
become
of
you
.
I
thought
you
might
*NL*
be
sick
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
,
as
always
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
No
,
I
am
not
*NL*
well
.
Yes
,
I
am
SEEK
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
monsieur
to
sit
down
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Nioche
.
``
Garcon
,
bring
a
*NL*
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
do
us
the
honor
to
SEAT
?
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
timorously
,
and
with
*NL*
a
double
foreignness
of
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
said
to
himself
that
he
had
better
see
the
thing
out
and
he
took
*NL*
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
with
Mademoiselle
Nioche
on
his
left
*NL*
and
her
father
on
the
other
side
.
``
You
will
take
something
,
of
course
,
''
*NL*
said
Miss
Noemie
,
who
was
sipping
a
glass
of
madeira
.
Newman
said
that
*NL*
he
believed
not
,
and
then
she
turned
to
her
papa
with
a
smile
.
``
What
an
*NL*
honor
,
eh
?
he
has
come
only
for
us
.
''
M.
Nioche
drained
his
pungent
*NL*
glass
at
a
long
draught
,
and
looked
out
from
eyes
more
lachrymose
in
*NL*
consequence
.
``
But
you
did
n't
come
for
me
,
eh
?
''
Mademoiselle
Noemie
went
*NL*
on
.
``
You
did
n't
expect
to
find
me
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
observed
the
change
in
her
appearance
.
She
was
very
elegant
*NL*
and
prettier
than
before
;
she
looked
a
year
or
two
older
,
and
it
was
*NL*
noticeable
that
,
to
the
eye
,
she
had
only
gained
in
respectability
.
*NL*
She
looked
``
lady-like
.
''
She
was
dressed
in
quiet
colors
,
and
wore
her
*NL*
expensively
unobtrusive
toilet
with
a
grace
that
might
have
come
from
*NL*
years
of
practice
.
Her
present
self-possession
and
aplomb
struck
Newman
*NL*
as
really
infernal
,
and
he
inclined
to
agree
with
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
that
the
young
lady
was
very
remarkable
.
``
No
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
come
for
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
did
n't
expect
to
find
you
.
I
was
*NL*
told
,
''
he
added
in
a
moment
``
that
you
had
left
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quelle
horreur
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
Nioche
with
a
smile
.
``
Does
one
*NL*
leave
one
's
father
?
You
have
the
proof
of
the
contrary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
convincing
proof
,
''
said
Newman
glancing
at
M.
Nioche
.
The
old
man
*NL*
caught
his
glance
obliquely
,
with
his
faded
,
deprecating
eye
,
and
then
,
*NL*
lifting
his
empty
glass
,
pretended
to
drink
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
that
?
''
Noemie
demanded
.
``
I
know
very
well
.
It
was
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
Why
do
n't
you
say
yes
?
You
are
not
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
embarrassed
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
set
you
a
better
example
.
I
know
M.
de
Bellegarde
told
you
.
He
knows
*NL*
a
great
deal
about
me
--
or
he
thinks
he
does
.
He
has
taken
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
trouble
to
find
out
,
but
half
of
it
is
n't
true
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
I
have
n't
left
my
father
;
I
am
much
too
fond
of
him
.
Is
n't
it
so
,
little
*NL*
father
?
M.
de
Bellegarde
is
a
charming
young
man
;
it
is
impossible
to
be
*NL*
cleverer
.
I
know
a
good
deal
about
him
too
;
you
can
tell
him
that
when
*NL*
you
next
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
a
sturdy
grin
;
``
I
wo
n't
carry
any
messages
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
``
I
do
n't
depend
upon
*NL*
you
,
nor
does
M.
de
Bellegarde
either
.
He
is
very
much
interested
in
me
;
*NL*
he
can
be
left
to
his
own
devices
.
He
is
a
contrast
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
a
great
contrast
to
me
,
I
have
no
doubt
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
exactly
know
how
you
mean
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
it
in
this
way
.
First
of
all
,
he
never
offered
to
help
me
to
a
*NL*
dot
and
a
husband
.
''
And
Mademoiselle
Nioche
paused
,
smiling
.
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
that
is
in
his
favor
,
for
I
do
you
justice

What
led
you
,
by
the
*NL*
way
,
to
make
me
such
a
queer
offer
?
You
did
n't
care
for
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
did
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
given
me
real
pleasure
to
see
you
married
to
a
*NL*
respectable
young
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
six
thousand
francs
of
income
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
Nioche
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
call
that
caring
for
me
?
I
'm
afraid
you
know
little
about
women
.
You
*NL*
were
not
galant
;
you
were
not
what
you
might
have
been

''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
flushed
a
trifle
fiercely
.
``
Come
!
''
he
exclaimed
``
that
's
rather
*NL*
strong
.
I
had
no
idea
I
had
been
so
shabby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
smiled
as
she
took
up
her
muff
.
``
It
is
something
,
at
*NL*
any
rate
,
to
have
made
you
angry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
had
leaned
both
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
his
head
,
bent
*NL*
forward
,
was
supported
in
his
hands
,
the
thin
white
fingers
of
which
*NL*
were
pressed
over
his
ears
.
In
his
position
he
was
staring
fixedly
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
his
empty
glass
,
and
Newman
supposed
he
was
not
hearing
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
buttoned
her
furred
jacket
and
pushed
back
her
*NL*
chair
,
casting
a
glance
charged
with
the
consciousness
of
an
expensive
*NL*
appearance
first
down
over
her
flounces
and
then
up
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
have
remained
an
honest
girl
,
''
Newman
said
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
continued
to
stare
at
the
bottom
of
his
glass
,
and
his
*NL*
daughter
got
up
,
still
bravely
smiling
.
``
You
mean
that
I
look
so
much
*NL*
like
one
?
That
's
more
than
most
women
do
nowadays
.
Do
n't
judge
me
yet
a
*NL*
while
,
''
she
added
.
``
I
mean
to
succeed
;
that
's
what
I
mean
to
do
.
I
leave
*NL*
you
;
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
seen
in
cafes
,
for
one
thing
.
I
ca
n't
think
*NL*
what
you
want
of
my
poor
father
;
he
's
very
comfortable
now
.
It
is
n't
his
*NL*
fault
,
either
.
Au
revoir
,
little
father
.
''
And
she
tapped
the
old
man
on
*NL*
the
head
with
her
muff
.
Then
she
stopped
a
minute
,
looking
at
Newman
.
*NL*
``
Tell
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
when
he
wants
news
of
me
,
to
come
and
get
it
*NL*
from
ME
!
''
And
she
turned
and
departed
,
the
white-aproned
waiter
,
with
a
*NL*
bow
,
holding
the
door
wide
open
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
sat
motionless
,
and
Newman
hardly
knew
what
to
say
to
him
.
The
*NL*
old
man
looked
dismally
foolish
.
``
So
you
determined
not
to
shoot
her
,
*NL*
after
all
,
''
Newman
said
,
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
,
without
moving
,
raised
his
eyes
and
gave
him
a
long
,
peculiar
*NL*
look
.
It
seemed
to
confess
everything
,
and
yet
not
to
ask
for
pity
,
nor
*NL*
to
pretend
,
on
the
other
hand
,
to
a
rugged
ability
to
do
without
it
.
It
*NL*
might
have
expressed
the
state
of
mind
of
an
innocuous
insect
,
flat
*NL*
in
shape
and
conscious
of
the
impending
pressure
of
a
boot-sole
,
and
*NL*
reflecting
that
he
was
perhaps
too
flat
to
be
crushed
.
M.
Nioche
's
gaze
*NL*
was
a
profession
of
moral
flatness
.
``
You
despise
me
terribly
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
in
the
weakest
possible
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
it
is
none
of
my
business
.
It
's
a
good
plan
to
*NL*
take
things
easily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
made
you
too
many
fine
speeches
,
''
M.
Nioche
added
.
``
I
meant
them
at
*NL*
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
am
very
glad
you
did
n't
shoot
her
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
was
*NL*
afraid
you
might
have
shot
yourself
.
That
is
why
I
came
to
look
you
up
.
''
*NL*
And
he
began
to
button
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
.
``
You
despise
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
explain
to
you
.
*NL*
I
hoped
I
should
n't
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
rather
shabby
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
should
n't
drop
your
*NL*
friends
that
way
.
Besides
,
the
last
time
you
came
to
see
me
I
thought
*NL*
you
particularly
jolly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
remember
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
musingly
;
``
I
was
in
a
fever
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
what
I
said
,
what
I
did
.
It
was
delirium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
you
are
quieter
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
was
silent
a
moment
.
``
As
quiet
as
the
grave
,
''
he
whispered
*NL*
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
unhappy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
rubbed
his
forehead
slowly
,
and
even
pushed
back
his
wig
a
*NL*
little
,
looking
askance
at
his
empty
glass
.
``
Yes
--
yes
.
But
that
's
an
old
*NL*
story
.
I
have
always
been
unhappy
.
My
daughter
does
what
she
will
with
*NL*
me
.
I
take
what
she
gives
me
,
good
or
bad
.
I
have
no
spirit
,
and
when
*NL*
you
have
no
spirit
you
must
keep
quiet
.
I
sha
n't
trouble
you
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
rather
disgusted
at
the
smooth
operation
of
the
old
*NL*
man
's
philosophy
,
``
that
's
as
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
seemed
to
have
been
prepared
to
be
despised
but
nevertheless
*NL*
he
made
a
feeble
movement
of
appeal
from
Newman
's
faint
praise
.
``
After
*NL*
all
,
''
he
said
,
``
she
is
my
daughter
,
and
I
can
still
look
after
her
.
If
*NL*
she
will
do
wrong
,
why
she
will
.
But
there
are
many
different
*NL*
paths
,
there
are
degrees
.
I
can
give
her
the
benefit
--
give
her
the
*NL*
benefit
''
--
and
M.
Nioche
paused
,
staring
vaguely
at
Newman
,
who
began
to
*NL*
suspect
that
his
brain
had
softened
--
``
the
benefit
of
my
experience
,
''
M.
*NL*
Nioche
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
experience
?
''
inquired
Newman
,
both
amused
and
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
experience
of
business
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
,
``
that
will
be
a
great
advantage
to
*NL*
her
!
''
And
then
he
said
good-by
,
and
offered
the
poor
,
foolish
old
man
*NL*
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
took
it
and
leaned
back
against
the
wall
,
holding
it
a
moment
*NL*
and
looking
up
at
him
.
``
I
suppose
you
think
my
wits
are
going
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
Very
likely
;
I
have
always
a
pain
in
my
head
.
That
's
why
I
ca
n't
*NL*
explain
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
And
she
's
so
strong
,
she
makes
me
walk
as
she
*NL*
will
,
anywhere
!
But
there
's
this
--
there
's
this
.
''
And
he
stopped
,
still
*NL*
staring
up
at
Newman
.
His
little
white
eyes
expanded
and
glittered
for
a
*NL*
moment
like
those
of
a
cat
in
the
dark
.
``
It
's
not
as
it
seems
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
forgiven
her
.
Oh
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
;
do
n't
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
She
's
a
bad
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
horrible
,
it
's
horrible
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
;
``
but
do
you
want
to
know
*NL*
the
truth
?
I
hate
her
!
I
take
what
she
gives
me
,
and
I
hate
her
*NL*
more
.
To-day
she
brought
me
three
hundred
francs
;
they
are
here
in
my
*NL*
waistcoat
pocket
.
Now
I
hate
her
almost
cruelly
.
No
,
I
have
n't
forgiven
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
accept
the
money
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
n't
,
''
said
M.
Nioche
,
``
I
should
have
hated
her
still
more
.
*NL*
That
's
what
misery
is
.
No
,
I
have
n't
forgiven
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
hurt
her
!
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
again
.
And
with
*NL*
this
he
took
his
leave
.
As
he
passed
along
the
glazed
side
of
the
cafe
,
*NL*
on
reaching
the
street
,
he
saw
the
old
man
motioning
the
waiter
,
with
a
*NL*
melancholy
gesture
,
to
replenish
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
a
week
after
his
visit
to
the
Cafe
de
la
Patrie
,
he
called
upon
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
,
and
by
good
fortune
found
him
at
home
.
Newman
*NL*
spoke
of
his
interview
with
M.
Nioche
and
his
daughter
,
and
said
he
*NL*
was
afraid
Valentin
had
judged
the
old
man
correctly
.
He
had
found
the
*NL*
couple
hobnobbing
together
in
all
amity
;
the
old
gentleman
's
rigor
was
*NL*
purely
theoretic
.
Newman
confessed
that
he
was
disappointed
;
he
should
*NL*
have
expected
to
see
M.
Nioche
take
high
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
High
ground
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Valentin
,
laughing
;
``
there
is
*NL*
no
high
ground
for
him
to
take
.
The
only
perceptible
eminence
in
M.
*NL*
Nioche
's
horizon
is
Montmartre
,
which
is
not
an
edifying
quarter
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
go
mountaineering
in
a
flat
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
remarked
,
indeed
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
that
he
has
not
forgiven
her
.
But
*NL*
she
'll
never
find
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
do
him
the
justice
to
suppose
he
does
n't
like
the
thing
,
''
*NL*
Valentin
rejoined
.
``
Mademoiselle
Nioche
is
like
the
great
artists
whose
*NL*
biographies
we
read
,
who
at
the
beginning
of
their
career
have
*NL*
suffered
opposition
in
the
domestic
circle
.
Their
vocation
has
not
*NL*
been
recognized
by
their
families
,
but
the
world
has
done
it
justice
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
has
a
vocation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
''
said
Newman
,
impatiently
,
``
you
take
the
little
baggage
too
*NL*
seriously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
do
;
but
when
one
has
nothing
to
think
about
,
one
must
think
of
*NL*
little
baggages
.
I
suppose
it
is
better
to
be
serious
about
light
things
*NL*
than
not
to
be
serious
at
all
.
This
little
baggage
entertains
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
has
discovered
that
.
She
knows
you
have
been
hunting
her
up
*NL*
and
asking
questions
about
her
.
She
is
very
much
tickled
by
it
.
That
's
*NL*
rather
annoying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annoying
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
laughed
Valentin
;
``
not
the
least
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hanged
if
I
should
want
to
have
a
greedy
little
adventuress
like
that
*NL*
know
I
was
giving
myself
such
pains
about
her
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
woman
is
always
worth
one
's
pains
,
''
objected
Valentin
.
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Nioche
is
welcome
to
be
tickled
by
my
curiosity
,
and
to
*NL*
know
that
I
am
tickled
that
she
is
tickled
.
She
is
not
so
much
tickled
,
*NL*
by
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
and
tell
her
,
''
Newman
rejoined
.
``
She
gave
me
a
*NL*
message
for
you
of
some
such
drift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your
quiet
imagination
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
I
have
been
to
see
*NL*
her
--
three
times
in
five
days
.
She
is
a
charming
hostess
;
we
talk
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
and
the
musical
glasses
.
She
is
extremely
clever
and
a
very
*NL*
curious
type
;
not
at
all
coarse
or
wanting
to
be
coarse
;
determined
not
*NL*
to
be
.
She
means
to
take
very
good
care
of
herself
.
She
is
extremely
*NL*
perfect
;
she
is
as
hard
and
clear-cut
as
some
little
figure
of
a
*NL*
sea-nymph
in
an
antique
intaglio
,
and
I
will
warrant
that
she
has
not
*NL*
a
grain
more
of
sentiment
or
heart
than
if
she
was
scooped
out
of
a
*NL*
big
amethyst
.
You
ca
n't
scratch
her
even
with
a
diamond
.
*NL*
Extremely
pretty
,
--
really
,
when
you
know
her
,
she
is
wonderfully
*NL*
pretty
,
--
intelligent
,
determined
,
ambitious
,
unscrupulous
,
capable
of
*NL*
looking
at
a
man
strangled
without
changing
color
,
she
is
upon
my
honor
,
*NL*
extremely
entertaining
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fine
list
of
attractions
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
they
would
serve
as
a
*NL*
police-detective
's
description
of
a
favorite
criminal
.
I
should
sum
them
*NL*
up
by
another
word
than
`
entertaining
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
is
just
the
word
to
use
.
I
do
n't
say
she
is
laudable
or
*NL*
lovable
.
I
do
n't
want
her
as
my
wife
or
my
sister
.
But
she
is
a
*NL*
very
curious
and
ingenious
piece
of
machinery
;
I
like
to
see
it
in
*NL*
operation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
seen
some
very
curious
machines
too
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
and
*NL*
once
,
in
a
needle
factory
,
I
saw
a
gentleman
from
the
city
,
who
had
*NL*
stopped
too
near
one
of
them
,
picked
up
as
neatly
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
prodded
by
a
fork
,
swallowed
down
straight
,
and
ground
into
small
*NL*
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reentering
his
domicile
,
late
in
the
evening
,
three
days
after
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
had
made
her
bargain
with
him
--
the
expression
is
sufficiently
*NL*
correct
--
touching
the
entertainment
at
which
she
was
to
present
him
to
*NL*
the
world
,
he
found
on
his
table
a
card
of
goodly
dimensions
bearing
an
*NL*
announcement
that
this
lady
would
be
at
home
on
the
27th
of
the
month
,
*NL*
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
He
stuck
it
into
the
frame
of
his
mirror
*NL*
and
eyed
it
with
some
complacency
;
it
seemed
an
agreeable
emblem
of
*NL*
triumph
,
documentary
evidence
that
his
prize
was
gained
.
Stretched
out
*NL*
in
a
chair
,
he
was
looking
at
it
lovingly
,
when
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
was
shown
into
the
room
.
Valentin
's
glance
presently
followed
the
*NL*
direction
of
Newman
's
,
and
he
perceived
his
mother
's
invitation

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
they
put
into
the
corner

he
asked
.
``
Not
the
customary
*NL*
`
music
,

`
dancing

They
ought
at

to
put
*NL*
`
An
American

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
are
to
be
several
of
us
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Mrs.
Tristram
told
me
*NL*
to-day
that
she
had
received
a
card

sent
an
acceptance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
then

with
Mrs.
Tristram

her
husband
you
will
have
support

My

might
have
put
on
her
card
`
Three
Americans

But
I
suspect
you
*NL*
will
not
lack
amusement
.
You
will
see
a
great
many
of
the
best
people
in
*NL*
France
.
I
mean
the
long
pedigrees
and
the
high
noses
,
and
all
that
.
Some
*NL*
of
them
are
awful
idiots
;
I
advise
you
to
take
them
up
cautiously

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
guess
I
shall
like
them

said
Newman

``
I
am

am
in
high
good-humor

*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
dropped
himself
into
*NL*
a
chair
with
an
unwonted
air
of
weariness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
man
!
''
he
said
with
a
sigh
.
``
Take
care
you
do
n't
become
*NL*
offensive

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
any
one
chooses
to
take
offense

he
may

I
have
a
good
conscience

*NL*
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
really
in
love
with
my
sister

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Newman
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
also
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
she
likes
me

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
witchcraft
you
have
used

Valentin
asked
.
``
How
do
YOU
make

love

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
have
n't
any

said
Newman
.
``
In
any
way
that
seems
*NL*
acceptable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
that
,
if
one
knew
it

''
said
Valentin
,
laughing
,
``
you
are
a
*NL*
terrible
customer

seven-league
boots

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
the

Newman
said
in

response
to
this
.
``
You
are
vicious

Spare
me
all
discordant

settled
down

*NL*
``
About

*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
was
silent
a
while
,
and
then
he
said
,
``
And
you
feel
very
*NL*
confident

*NL*
*NL*
``
Confident

*NL*
``
Sure

said
Newman

``
So

Yes

``
You

*NL*
*NL*

That

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not

a

countess

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the

But
my
countess
shall
not
be
disappointed

I
answer

her
happiness

''
And
as
if
he
felt
the
impulse
to
celebrate
his
happy
*NL*
certitude
by
a
bonfire
,
he
got
up
to
throw
a
couple
of
logs
upon
the
*NL*
already
blazing
hearth
.
Valentin
watched
for
a
few
moments
the
quickened
*NL*
flame
,
and
then
,
with
his
head
leaning
on
his
hand
,
gave
a
melancholy
*NL*
sigh
.
``
Got
a
headache
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
suis
triste

''
said
Valentin
,
with
Gallic
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sad
,
eh
?
It
is
about
the
lady
you
said
the
other
night
that
you
*NL*
adored
and
that
you
could
n't
marry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
really
say
that

It
seemed
to
me
afterwards
that
the
words
had
*NL*
escaped
me
.
Before
Claire
it
was
bad
taste
.
But
I
felt
gloomy
as
I
*NL*
spoke
,
and
I
feel
gloomy
still
.
Why
did
you
ever
introduce
me
to
that
*NL*
girl
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
Noemie

is
it

Lord
deliver
us

You
do
n't

you
are
*NL*
lovesick
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovesick
,
no
;
it
's
not
a
grand
passion

But
the
cold-blooded
little
*NL*
demon
sticks
in
my
thoughts
;
she
has
bitten
me
with
those
even
little
*NL*
teeth
of
hers
;
I
feel
as
if
I
might
turn
rabid
and
do
something
crazy
*NL*
in

It
's
very
low

it
's
disgustingly
low

She
's
the
most
*NL*
mercenary
little
jade
in
Europe

Yet
she
really
affects
my
peace
of
*NL*
mind

she
is
always
running
in
my
head

It
's
a
striking
contrast
to
your
*NL*
noble
and
virtuous
attachment

a
vile
contrast

It
is
rather
pitiful

that
it
should
be
the
best
I
am
able
to
do
for
myself
at
my
present
*NL*
respectable
age

I
am
a
nice
young
man

eh

You
ca

my
future

as
you
do
your
own

*NL*
*NL*
``
Drop
that
girl

short
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
do
n't
go
near
her
again

and
your

do

Come
over
to
America

I
will
get
you
a
place
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
to

said
Valentin
,
with
a
light
laugh
.
``
You
*NL*
ca
n't
drop
a
pretty

One
must
be
polite

even
with

Noemie

Besides

I
'll
not
have
her

I
am
afraid
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
between
politeness
and
vanity
,
you
will
get
deeper
into
the
mud
?
*NL*
Keep
them
both
for
something
better
.
Remember
,
too
,
that
I
did
n't
want
*NL*
to
introduce
you
to
her
:
you
insisted
.
I
had
a
sort
of
uneasy
feeling
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
reproach
you
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
Heaven
forbid
!
I
would
n't
*NL*
for
the
world
have
missed
knowing
her

She
is
really
extraordinary

The
*NL*
way
she
has
already
spread
her
wings
is
amazing
.
I
do
n't
know
when
a
*NL*
woman
has
amused
me
more
.
But
excuse
me
,
''
he
added
in
an
instant
;
``
she
*NL*
does
n't
amuse
you
,
at
second
hand
,
and
the
subject
is
an
impure
one

*NL*
Let
us
talk
of
something
else

''
Valentin
introduced
another
topic
,
but
*NL*
within
five
minutes
Newman
observed
that
,
by
a
bold
transition
,
he
had
*NL*
reverted
to
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
and
was
giving
pictures
of
her
manners
*NL*
and
quoting
specimens
of
her
mots
.
These
were
very
witty
,
and
,
for
a
*NL*
young
woman
who
six
months
before
had
been
painting
the
most
artless
*NL*
madonnas
,
startlingly
cynical
.
But
at
last
,
abruptly
,
he
stopped
,
became
*NL*
thoughtful
,
and
for
some
time
afterwards
said
nothing
.
When
he
rose
to
*NL*
go
it
was
evident
that
his
thoughts
were
still
running
upon
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
.
``
Yes
,
she
's
a
frightful
little
monster
!

he
said
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
ten
days
were
the
happiest
that
Newman
had
ever
known
.
He
*NL*
saw
Madame
de
Cintre
every
day
,
and
never
saw
either
old
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
or
the
elder
of
his
prospective
brothers-in-law
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
at
last
seemed
to
think
it
becoming
to
apologize
for
their
never
*NL*
being
present
.
``
They
are
much
taken
up
,
''
she
said
,
``
with
doing
the
*NL*
honors
of
Paris
to
Lord
Deepmere
.
''
There
was
a
smile
in
her
gravity
*NL*
as
she
made
this
declaration
,
and
it
deepened
as
she
added
,
``
He
is
our
*NL*
seventh
cousin
,
you
know
,
and
blood
is
thicker
than
water
.
And
then
,
he
*NL*
is
so
interesting
!
''
And
with
this
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
met
young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
two
or
three
times
,
always
roaming
*NL*
about
with
graceful
vagueness
,
as
if
in
search
of
an
unattainable
ideal
*NL*
of
amusement
.
She
always
reminded
him
of
a
painted
perfume-bottle
with
a
*NL*
crack
in
it
;
but
he
had
grown
to
have
a
kindly
feeling
for
her
,
based
*NL*
on
the
fact
of
her
owing
conjugal
allegiance
to
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
He
pitied
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
wife
,
especially
since
she
was
a
silly
,
*NL*
thirstily-smiling
little
brunette
,
with
a
suggestion
of
an
unregulated
*NL*
heart
.
The
small
marquise
sometimes
looked
at
him
with
an
intensity
*NL*
too
marked
not
to
be
innocent
,
for
coquetry
is
more
finely
shaded
.
*NL*
She
apparently
wanted
to
ask
him
something
or
tell
him
something
;
he
*NL*
wondered
what
it
was
.
But
he
was
shy
of
giving
her
an
opportunity
,
*NL*
because
,
if
her
communication
bore
upon
the
aridity
of
her
matrimonial
*NL*
lot
,
he
was
at
a
loss
to
see
how
he
could
help
her
.
He
had
a
fancy
,
*NL*
however
,
of
her
coming
up
to
him
some
day
and
saying
-LRB-
after
looking
*NL*
around
behind
her
-RRB-
with
a
little
passionate
hiss
,
``
I
know
you
detest
my
*NL*
husband
;
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
assuring
you
for
once
that
you
*NL*
are
right
.
Pity
a
poor
woman
who
is
married
to
a
clock-image
in
*NL*
papier-mache
!
''
Possessing
,
however
,
in
default
of
a
competent
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
principles
of
etiquette
,
a
very
downright
sense
of
the
``
meanness
''
*NL*
of
certain
actions
,
it
seemed
to
him
to
belong
to
his
position
to
keep
*NL*
on
his
guard
;
he
was
not
going
to
put
it
into
the
power
of
these
people
*NL*
to
say
that
in
their
house
he
had
done
anything
unpleasant
.
As
it
was
,
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
used
to
give
him
news
of
the
dress
she
meant
to
*NL*
wear
at
his
wedding
,
and
which
had
not
yet
,
in
her
creative
imagination
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
many
interviews
with
the
tailor
,
resolved
itself
into
its
*NL*
composite
totality
.
``
I
told
you
pale
blue
bows
on
the
sleeves
,
at
the
*NL*
elbows
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
to-day
I
do
n't
see
my
blue
bows
at
all
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
has
become
of
them
.
To-day
I
see
pink
--
a
tender
pink
.
And
then
*NL*
I
pass
through
strange
,
dull
phases
in
which
neither
blue
nor
pink
says
*NL*
anything
to
me
.
And
yet
I
must
have
the
bows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
them
green
or
yellow
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Malheureux
!
''
the
little
marquise
would
cry
.
``
Green
bows
would
break
*NL*
your
marriage
--
your
children
would
be
illegitimate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
was
calmly
happy
before
the
world
,
and
Newman
had
the
*NL*
felicity
of
fancying
that
before
him
,
when
the
world
was
absent
,
she
*NL*
was
almost
agitatedly
happy
.
She
said
very
tender
things
.
``
I
take
no
*NL*
pleasure
in
you
.
You
never
give
me
a
chance
to
scold
you
,
to
correct
*NL*
you
.
I
bargained
for
that
,
I
expected
to
enjoy
it
.
But
you
wo
n't
do
*NL*
anything
dreadful
;
you
are
dismally
inoffensive
.
It
is
very
stupid
;
*NL*
there
is
no
excitement
for
me
;
I
might
as
well
be
marrying
some
one
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
's
the
worst
I
can
do
,
''
Newman
would
say
in
answer
to
*NL*
this
.
``
Kindly
overlook
the
deficiency
.
''
He
assured
her
that
he
,
at
*NL*
least
,
would
never
scold
her
;
she
was
perfectly
satisfactory
.
``
If
you
*NL*
only
knew
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
exactly
you
are
what
I
coveted
!
And
I
am
*NL*
beginning
to
understand
why
I
coveted
it
;
the
having
it
makes
all
the
*NL*
difference
that
I
expected
.
Never
was
a
man
so
pleased
with
his
good
*NL*
fortune
.
You
have
been
holding
your
head
for
a
week
past
just
as
I
*NL*
wanted
my
wife
to
hold
hers
.
You
say
just
the
things
I
want
her
to
say
.
*NL*
You
walk
about
the
room
just
as
I
want
her
to
walk
.
You
have
just
the
*NL*
taste
in
dress
that
I
want
her
to
have
.
In
short
,
you
come
up
to
the
*NL*
mark
,
and
,
I
can
tell
you
,
my
mark
was
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
observations
seemed
to
make
Madame
de
Cintre
rather
grave
.
At
last
*NL*
she
said
,
``
Depend
upon
it
,
I
do
n't
come
up
to
the
mark
;
your
mark
is
too
*NL*
high
.
I
am
not
all
that
you
suppose
;
I
am
a
much
smaller
affair
.
She
*NL*
is
a
magnificent
woman
,
your
ideal
.
Pray
,
how
did
she
come
to
such
*NL*
perfection
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
never
anything
else
,
''
Newman
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
believe
,
''
Madame
de
Cintre
went
on
,
``
that
she
is
better
than
*NL*
my
own
ideal
.
Do
you
know
that
is
a
very
handsome
compliment
?
Well
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
will
make
her
my
own
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
came
to
see
her
dear
Claire
after
Newman
had
announced
his
*NL*
engagement
,
and
she
told
our
hero
the
next
day
that
his
good
fortune
was
*NL*
simply
absurd
.
``
For
the
ridiculous
part
of
it
is
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
*NL*
are
evidently
going
to
be
as
happy
as
if
you
were
marrying
Miss
Smith
*NL*
or
Miss
Thompson
.
I
call
it
a
brilliant
match
for
you
,
but
you
get
*NL*
brilliancy
without
paying
any
tax
upon
it
.
Those
things
are
usually
a
*NL*
compromise
,
but
here
you
have
everything
,
and
nothing
crowds
anything
*NL*
else
out
.
You
will
be
brilliantly
happy
as
well
.
''
Newman
thanked
her
for
*NL*
her
pleasant
,
encouraging
way
of
saying
things
;
no
woman
could
encourage
*NL*
or
discourage
better
.
Tristram
's
way
of
saying
things
was
different
;
he
*NL*
had
been
taken
by
his
wife
to
call
upon
Madame
de
Cintre
,
and
he
gave
an
*NL*
account
of
the
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
catch
me
giving
an
opinion
on
your
countess
this
time
,
''
he
*NL*
said
;
``
I
put
my
foot
in
it
once
.
That
's
a
d
--
d
underhand
thing
to
do
,
by
*NL*
the
way
--
coming
round
to
sound
a
fellow
upon
the
woman
you
are
going
to
*NL*
marry
.
You
deserve
anything
you
get
.
Then
of
course
you
rush
and
tell
*NL*
her
,
and
she
takes
care
to
make
it
pleasant
for
the
poor
spiteful
wretch
*NL*
the
first
time
he
calls
.
I
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
,
however
,
*NL*
that
you
do
n't
seem
to
have
told
Madame
de
Cintre
;
or
if
you
have
she
's
*NL*
uncommonly
magnanimous
.
She
was
very
nice
;
she
was
tremendously
polite
.
*NL*
She
and
Lizzie
sat
on
the
sofa
,
pressing
each
other
's
hands
and
calling
*NL*
each
other
chere
belle
,
and
Madame
de
Cintre
sent
me
with
every
third
*NL*
word
a
magnificent
smile
,
as
if
to
give
me
to
understand
that
I
too
was
*NL*
a
handsome
dear
.
She
quite
made
up
for
past
neglect
,
I
assure
you
;
she
*NL*
was
very
pleasant
and
sociable
.
Only
in
an
evil
hour
it
came
into
her
*NL*
head
to
say
that
she
must
present
us
to
her
mother
--
her
mother
wished
*NL*
to
know
your
friends
.
I
did
n't
want
to
know
her
mother
,
and
I
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
telling
Lizzie
to
go
in
alone
and
let
me
wait
for
her
outside
.
*NL*
But
Lizzie
,
with
her
usual
infernal
ingenuity
,
guessed
my
purpose
and
*NL*
reduced
me
by
a
glance
of
her
eye
.
So
they
marched
off
arm
in
arm
,
and
*NL*
I
followed
as
I
could
.
We
found
the
old
lady
in
her
arm-chair
,
twiddling
*NL*
her
aristocratic
thumbs
.
She
looked
at
Lizzie
from
head
to
foot
;
but
at
*NL*
that
game
Lizzie
,
to
do
her
justice
,
was
a
match
for
her
.
My
wife
told
*NL*
her
we
were
great
friends
of
Mr.
Newman
.
The
marquise
started
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
then
said
,
`
Oh
,
Mr.
Newman
!
My
daughter
has
made
up
her
mind
to
*NL*
marry
a
Mr.
Newman
.
'
Then
Madame
de
Cintre
began
to
fondle
Lizzie
again
,
*NL*
and
said
it
was
this
dear
lady
that
had
planned
the
match
and
*NL*
brought
them
together
.
`
Oh
,
't
is
you
I
have
to
thank
for
my
American
*NL*
son-in-law
,
'
the
old
lady
said
to
Mrs.
Tristram
.
`
It
was
a
very
clever
*NL*
thought
of
yours
.
Be
sure
of
my
gratitude
.
'
And
then
she
began
to
look
*NL*
at
me
and
presently
said
,
`
Pray
,
are
you
engaged
in
some
species
of
*NL*
manufacture
?
'
I
wanted
to
say
that
I
manufactured
broom-sticks
for
old
*NL*
witches
to
ride
on
,
but
Lizzie
got
in
ahead
of
me
.
`
My
husband
,
Madame
*NL*
la
Marquise
,
'
she
said
,
`
belongs
to
that
unfortunate
class
of
persons
*NL*
who
have
no
profession
and
no
business
,
and
do
very
little
good
in
*NL*
the
world
.
'
To
get
her
poke
at
the
old
woman
she
did
n't
care
where
she
*NL*
shoved
me
.
`
Dear
me
,
'
said
the
marquise
,
`
we
all
have
our
duties
.
'
'
I
am
*NL*
sorry
mine
compel
me
to
take
leave
of
you
,
'
said
Lizzie
.
And
we
bundled
*NL*
out
again
.
But
you
have
a
mother-in-law
,
in
all
the
force
of
the
term
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
my
mother-in-law
desires
nothing
better
than
to
let
*NL*
me
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betimes
,
on
the
evening
of
the
27th
,
he
went
to
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
ball
.
The
old
house
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
looked
strangely
*NL*
brilliant
.
In
the
circle
of
light
projected
from
the
outer
gate
a
*NL*
detachment
of
the
populace
stood
watching
the
carriages
roll
in
;
the
*NL*
court
was
illumined
with
flaring
torches
and
the
portico
carpeted
with
*NL*
crimson
.
When
Newman
arrived
there
were
but
a
few
people
present
.
The
*NL*
marquise
and
her
two
daughters
were
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
where
*NL*
the
sallow
old
nymph
in
the
angle
peeped
out
from
a
bower
of
plants
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
in
purple
and
fine
laces
,
looked
like
an
old
lady
*NL*
painted
by
Vandyke
;
Madame
de
Cintre
was
dressed
in
white
.
The
old
lady
*NL*
greeted
Newman
with
majestic
formality
,
and
looking
round
her
,
called
*NL*
several
of
the
persons
who
were
standing
near
.
They
were
elderly
*NL*
gentlemen
,
of
what
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
had
designated
as
the
*NL*
high-nosed
category
;
two
or
three
of
them
wore
cordons
and
stars
.
They
*NL*
approached
with
measured
alertness
,
and
the
marquise
said
that
she
*NL*
wished
to
present
them
to
Mr.
Newman
,
who
was
going
to
marry
her
*NL*
daughter
.
Then
she
introduced
successively
three
dukes
,
three
counts
,
*NL*
and
a
baron
.
These
gentlemen
bowed
and
smiled
most
agreeably
,
and
Newman
*NL*
indulged
in
a
series
of
impartial
hand-shakes
,
accompanied
by
a
``
Happy
*NL*
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
sir
.
''
He
looked
at
Madame
de
Cintre
,
but
she
*NL*
was
not
looking
at
him
.
If
his
personal
self-consciousness
had
been
of
*NL*
a
nature
to
make
him
constantly
refer
to
her
,
as
the
critic
before
whom
,
*NL*
in
company
,
he
played
his
part
,
he
might
have
found
it
a
flattering
*NL*
proof
of
her
confidence
that
he
never
caught
her
eyes
resting
upon
him
.
*NL*
It
is
a
reflection
Newman
did
not
make
,
but
we
nevertheless
risk
it
,
*NL*
that
in
spite
of
this
circumstance
she
probably
saw
every
movement
*NL*
of
his
little
finger
.
Young
Madame
de
Bellegarde
was
dressed
in
an
*NL*
audacious
toilet
of
crimson
crape
,
bestrewn
with
huge
silver
moons
--
thin
*NL*
crescent
and
full
disks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
anything
about
my
dress
,
''
she
said
to
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
,
''
he
answered
,
``
as
if
I
were
looking
at
you
through
a
telescope
.
*NL*
It
is
very
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
strange
it
matches
the
occasion
.
But
I
am
not
a
heavenly
*NL*
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
the
sky
at
midnight
that
particular
shade
of
crimson
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
originality
;
any
one
could
have
chosen
blue
.
My
*NL*
sister-in-law
would
have
chosen
a
lovely
shade
of
blue
,
with
a
dozen
*NL*
little
delicate
moons
.
But
I
think
crimson
is
much
more
amusing
.
And
I
*NL*
give
my
idea
,
which
is
moonshine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moonshine
and
bloodshed
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
murder
by
moonlight
,
''
laughed
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
What
a
delicious
*NL*
idea
for
a
toilet
!
To
make
it
complete
,
there
is
the
silver
dagger
,
you
*NL*
see
,
stuck
into
my
hair
.
But
here
comes
Lord
Deepmere
,
''
she
added
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
``
I
must
find
out
what
he
thinks
of
it
.
''
Lord
Deepmere
came
up
,
*NL*
looking
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
laughing
.
``
Lord
Deepmere
ca
n't
decide
*NL*
which
he
prefers
,
my
sister-in-law
or
me
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
``
He
likes
Claire
because
she
is
his
cousin
,
and
me
because
I
am
not
.
*NL*
But
he
has
no
right
to
make
love
to
Claire
,
whereas
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
disponible
.
It
is
very
wrong
to
make
love
to
a
woman
who
is
engaged
,
but
*NL*
it
is
very
wrong
not
to
make
love
to
a
woman
who
is
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
very
jolly
making
love
to
married
women
,
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
,
*NL*
``
because
they
ca
n't
ask
you
to
marry
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
the
others
do
,
the
spinsters
?
''
Newman
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
;
``
in
England
all
the
girls
ask
a
*NL*
fellow
to
marry
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
fellow
brutally
refuses
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
really
,
you
know
,
a
fellow
ca
n't
marry
any
girl
that
asks
him
,
''
*NL*
said
his
lordship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
cousin
wo
n't
ask
you
.
She
is
going
to
marry
Mr.
Newman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
a
very
different
thing
!
''
laughed
Lord
Deepmere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
accepted
HER
,
I
suppose
.
That
makes
me
hope
that
after
*NL*
all
you
prefer
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
when
things
are
nice
I
never
prefer
one
to
the
other

said
the
*NL*
young
Englishman
.
``
I
take
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
horror
!
I
wo
n't
be
taken
in
that
way
;
I
must
be
kept
apart

''
*NL*
cried
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
Mr.
Newman
is
much
better
;
he
knows
how
*NL*
to
choose
.
Oh
,
he
chooses
as
if
he
were
threading
a
needle
.
He
prefers
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
to
any
conceivable
creature
or
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
help
my
being
her
cousin
,
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
to
*NL*
Newman
,
with
candid
hilarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
ca
n't
help
that
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
back
;
``
neither
can
*NL*
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ca
n't
help
my
dancing
with
her
,
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
,
with
*NL*
sturdy
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
prevent
that
only
by
dancing
with
her
myself
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
But
unfortunately
I
do
n't
know
how
to
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
may
dance
without
knowing
how
;
may
you
not
,
milord
?
''
said
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
But
to
this
Lord
Deepmere
replied
that
a
fellow
*NL*
ought
to
know
how
to
dance
if
he
did
n't
want
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
;
*NL*
and
at
this
moment
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
joined
the
group
,
slow-stepping
*NL*
and
with
his
hands
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
very
splendid
entertainment
,
''
said
Newman
,
cheerfully
.
``
The
*NL*
old
house
looks
very
bright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
YOU
are
pleased
,
we
are
content
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
lifting
his
*NL*
shoulders
and
bending
them
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
suspect
every
one
is
pleased
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
How
can
they
help
*NL*
being
pleased
when
the
first
thing
they
see
as
they
come
in
is
your
*NL*
sister
,
standing
there
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
very
beautiful
,
''
rejoined
the
marquis
,
solemnly
.
``
But
that
*NL*
is
not
so
great
a
source
of
satisfaction
to
other
people
,
naturally
,
as
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
satisfied
,
marquis
,
I
am
satisfied
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
his
*NL*
protracted
enunciation
.
``
And
now
tell
me
,
''
he
added
,
looking
round
,
``
who
*NL*
some
of
your
friends
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
about
him
in
silence
,
with
his
head
bent
and
his
*NL*
hand
raised
to
his
lower
lip
,
which
he
slowly
rubbed
.
A
stream
of
people
*NL*
had
been
pouring
into
the
salon
in
which
Newman
stood
with
his
host
,
*NL*
the
rooms
were
filling
up
and
the
spectacle
had
become
brilliant
.
It
*NL*
borrowed
its
splendor
chiefly
from
the
shining
shoulders
and
profuse
*NL*
jewels
of
the
women
,
and
from
the
voluminous
elegance
of
their
dresses
.
*NL*
There
were
no
uniforms
,
as
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
door
was
inexorably
*NL*
closed
against
the
myrmidons
of
the
upstart
power
which
then
ruled
the
*NL*
fortunes
of
France
,
and
the
great
company
of
smiling
and
chattering
*NL*
faces
was
not
graced
by
any
very
frequent
suggestions
of
harmonious
*NL*
beauty
.
It
is
a
pity
,
nevertheless
,
that
Newman
had
not
been
a
*NL*
physiognomist
,
for
a
great
many
of
the
faces
were
irregularly
agreeable
,
*NL*
expressive
,
and
suggestive
.
If
the
occasion
had
been
different
they
*NL*
would
hardly
have
pleased
him
;
he
would
have
thought
the
women
not
*NL*
pretty
enough
and
the
men
too
smirking
;
but
he
was
now
in
a
humor
to
*NL*
receive
none
but
agreeable
impressions
,
and
he
looked
no
more
narrowly
*NL*
than
to
perceive
that
every
one
was
brilliant
,
and
to
feel
that
the
sun
*NL*
of
their
brilliancy
was
a
part
of
his
credit
.
``
I
will
present
you
to
*NL*
some
people
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
after
a
while
.
``
I
will
make
a
point
*NL*
of
it
,
in
fact
.
You
will
allow
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
shake
hands
with
any
one
you
want
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Your
*NL*
mother
just
introduced
me
to
half
a
dozen
old
gentlemen
.
Take
care
you
*NL*
do
n't
pick
up
the
same
parties
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
the
gentlemen
to
whom
my
mother
presented
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
forgot
them
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
.
``
The
people
here
*NL*
look
very
much
alike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
they
have
not
forgotten
you
,
''
said
the
marquis
.
And
he
began
*NL*
to
walk
through
the
rooms
.
Newman
,
to
keep
near
him
in
the
crowd
,
took
*NL*
his
arm
;
after
which
for
some
time
,
the
marquis
walked
straight
*NL*
along
,
in
silence
.
At
last
,
reaching
the
farther
end
of
the
suite
of
*NL*
reception-rooms
,
Newman
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
of
*NL*
monstrous
proportions
,
seated
in
a
very
capacious
arm-chair
,
with
*NL*
several
persons
standing
in
a
semicircle
round
her
.
This
little
group
*NL*
had
divided
as
the
marquis
came
up
,
and
M.
de
Bellegarde
stepped
forward
*NL*
and
stood
for
an
instant
silent
and
obsequious
,
with
his
hat
raised
to
*NL*
his
lips
,
as
Newman
had
seen
some
gentlemen
stand
in
churches
as
soon
as
*NL*
they
entered
their
pews
.
The
lady
,
indeed
,
bore
a
very
fair
likeness
to
*NL*
a
reverend
effigy
in
some
idolatrous
shrine
.
She
was
monumentally
stout
*NL*
and
imperturbably
serene
.
Her
aspect
was
to
Newman
almost
formidable
;
he
*NL*
had
a
troubled
consciousness
of
a
triple
chin
,
a
small
piercing
eye
,
a
*NL*
vast
expanse
of
uncovered
bosom
,
a
nodding
and
twinkling
tiara
of
plumes
*NL*
and
gems
,
and
an
immense
circumference
of
satin
petticoat
.
With
her
*NL*
little
circle
of
beholders
this
remarkable
woman
reminded
him
of
the
Fat
*NL*
Lady
at
a
fair
.
She
fixed
her
small
,
unwinking
eyes
at
the
new-comers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
duchess
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
``
let
me
present
you
our
good
friend
*NL*
Mr.
Newman
,
of
whom
you
have
heard
us
speak
.
Wishing
to
make
Mr.
Newman
*NL*
known
to
those
who
are
dear
to
us
,
I
could
not
possibly
fail
to
begin
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charmed
,
dear
friend
;
charmed
,
monsieur
,
''
said
the
duchess
in
a
voice
*NL*
which
,
though
small
and
shrill
,
was
not
disagreeable
,
while
Newman
*NL*
executed
his
obeisance
.
``
I
came
on
purpose
to
see
monsieur
.
I
hope
he
*NL*
appreciates
the
compliment
.
You
have
only
to
look
at
me
to
do
so
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
she
continued
,
sweeping
her
person
with
a
much-encompassing
glance
.
*NL*
Newman
hardly
knew
what
to
say
,
though
it
seemed
that
to
a
duchess
who
*NL*
joked
about
her
corpulence
one
might
say
almost
anything
.
On
hearing
*NL*
that
the
duchess
had
come
on
purpose
to
see
Newman
,
the
gentlemen
*NL*
who
surrounded
her
turned
a
little
and
looked
at
him
with
sympathetic
*NL*
curiosity
.
The
marquis
with
supernatural
gravity
mentioned
to
him
the
*NL*
name
of
each
,
while
the
gentleman
who
bore
it
bowed
;
they
were
all
what
*NL*
are
called
in
France
beaux
noms
.
``
I
wanted
extremely
to
see
you
,
''
the
*NL*
duchess
went
on
.
``
C'est
positif
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
am
very
fond
of
*NL*
the
person
you
are
going
to
marry
;
she
is
the
most
charming
creature
in
*NL*
France
.
Mind
you
treat
her
well
,
or
you
shall
hear
some
news
of
me
.
But
*NL*
you
look
as
if
you
were
good
.
I
am
told
you
are
very
remarkable
.
I
have
*NL*
heard
all
sorts
of
extraordinary
things
about
you
.
Voyons
,
are
they
*NL*
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
can
have
heard
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
have
your
legende
.
We
have
heard
that
you
have
had
a
career
the
*NL*
most
checkered
,
the
most
bizarre
.
What
is
that
about
your
having
founded
*NL*
a
city
some
ten
years
ago
in
the
great
West
,
a
city
which
contains
*NL*
to-day
half
a
million
of
inhabitants
?
Is
n't
it
half
a
million
,
*NL*
messieurs
?
You
are
exclusive
proprietor
of
this
flourishing
settlement
,
*NL*
and
are
consequently
fabulously
rich
,
and
you
would
be
richer
still
if
*NL*
you
did
n't
grant
lands
and
houses
free
of
rent
to
all
newcomers
who
will
*NL*
pledge
themselves
never
to
smoke
cigars
.
At
this
game
,
in
three
years
,
*NL*
we
are
told
,
you
are
going
to
be
made
president
of
America
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duchess
recited
this
amazing
``
legend
''
with
a
smooth
self-possession
*NL*
which
gave
the
speech
to
Newman
's
mind
,
the
air
of
being
a
bit
of
*NL*
amusing
dialogue
in
a
play
,
delivered
by
a
veteran
comic
actress
.
Before
*NL*
she
had
ceased
speaking
he
had
burst
into
loud
,
irrepressible
laughter
.
*NL*
``
Dear
duchess
,
dear
duchess
,
''
the
marquis
began
to
murmur
,
soothingly
.
*NL*
Two
or
three
persons
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
to
see
who
was
*NL*
laughing
at
the
duchess
.
But
the
lady
continued
with
the
soft
,
serene
*NL*
assurance
of
a
person
who
,
as
a
duchess
,
was
certain
of
being
listened
*NL*
to
,
and
,
as
a
garrulous
woman
,
was
independent
of
the
pulse
of
her
*NL*
auditors
.
``
But
I
know
you
are
very
remarkable
.
You
must
be
,
to
have
*NL*
endeared
yourself
to
this
good
marquis
and
to
his
admirable
world
.
They
*NL*
are
very
exacting
.
I
myself
am
not
very
sure
at
this
hour
of
really
*NL*
possessing
it
.
Eh
,
Bellegarde
?
To
please
you
,
I
see
,
one
must
be
an
*NL*
American
millionaire
.
But
your
real
triumph
,
my
dear
sir
,
is
pleasing
*NL*
the
countess
;
she
is
as
difficult
as
a
princess
in
a
fairy
tale
.
Your
*NL*
success
is
a
miracle
.
What
is
your
secret
?
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
reveal
it
*NL*
before
all
these
gentlemen
,
but
come
and
see
me
some
day
and
give
me
a
*NL*
specimen
of
your
talents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
secret
is
with
Madame
de
Cintre
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
must
ask
her
*NL*
for
it
.
It
consists
in
her
having
a
great
deal
of
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
pretty
!
''
said
the
duchess
.
``
That
's
a
very
nice
specimen
,
to
begin
*NL*
with
.
What
,
Bellegarde
,
are
you
already
taking
monsieur
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
duty
to
perform
,
dear
friend
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
other
groups
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
for
you
I
know
what
that
means
.
Well
,
I
have
seen
monsieur
;
that
*NL*
is
what
I
wanted
.
He
ca
n't
persuade
me
that
he
is
n't
very
clever
.
*NL*
Farewell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Newman
passed
on
with
his
host
,
he
asked
who
the
duchess
was
.
``
The
*NL*
greatest
lady
in
France
,
''
said
the
marquis
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
then
*NL*
presented
his
prospective
brother-in-law
to
some
twenty
other
persons
of
*NL*
both
sexes
,
selected
apparently
for
their
typically
august
character
.
*NL*
In
some
cases
this
character
was
written
in
good
round
hand
upon
the
*NL*
countenance
of
the
wearer
;
in
others
Newman
was
thankful
for
such
help
*NL*
as
his
companion
's
impressively
brief
intimation
contributed
to
the
*NL*
discovery
of
it
.
There
were
large
,
majestic
men
,
and
small
demonstrative
*NL*
men
;
there
were
ugly
ladies
in
yellow
lace
and
quaint
jewels
,
and
pretty
*NL*
ladies
with
white
shoulders
from
which
jewels
and
every
thing
else
were
*NL*
absent
.
Every
one
gave
Newman
extreme
attention
,
every
one
smiled
,
every
*NL*
one
was
charmed
to
make
his
acquaintance
,
every
one
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
that
soft
hardness
of
good
society
which
puts
out
its
hand
but
keeps
*NL*
its
fingers
closed
over
the
coin
.
If
the
marquis
was
going
about
as
a
*NL*
bear-leader
,
if
the
fiction
of
Beauty
and
the
Beast
was
supposed
to
have
*NL*
found
its
companion-piece
,
the
general
impression
appeared
to
be
*NL*
that
the
bear
was
a
very
fair
imitation
of
humanity
.
Newman
found
his
*NL*
reception
among
the
marquis
's
friends
very
``
pleasant
;
''
he
could
not
have
*NL*
said
more
for
it
.
It
was
pleasant
to
be
treated
with
so
much
explicit
*NL*
politeness
;
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
neatly
turned
civilities
,
with
a
*NL*
flavor
of
wit
,
uttered
from
beneath
carefully-shaped
mustaches
;
it
was
*NL*
pleasant
to
see
clever
Frenchwomen
--
they
all
seemed
clever
--
turn
their
*NL*
backs
to
their
partners
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
strange
American
whom
*NL*
Claire
de
Cintre
was
to
marry
,
and
reward
the
object
of
the
exhibition
*NL*
with
a
charming
smile
.
At
last
,
as
he
turned
away
from
a
battery
of
*NL*
smiles
and
other
amenities
,
Newman
caught
the
eye
of
the
marquis
looking
*NL*
at
him
heavily
;
and
thereupon
,
for
a
single
instant
,
he
checked
himself
.
*NL*
``
Am
I
behaving
like
a
d
--
d
fool
?
''
he
asked
himself
.
``
Am
I
stepping
*NL*
about
like
a
terrier
on
his
hind
legs
?
''
At
this
moment
he
perceived
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
and
he
waved
his
hand
in
*NL*
farewell
to
M.
de
Bellegarde
and
made
his
way
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
holding
my
head
too
high
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Do
I
look
as
if
I
had
the
*NL*
lower
end
of
a
pulley
fastened
to
my
chin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
like
all
happy
men
,
very
ridiculous
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
usual
thing
,
neither
better
nor
worse
.
I
have
been
watching
*NL*
you
for
the
last
ten
minutes
,
and
I
have
been
watching
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
He
does
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
credit
to
him
for
putting
it
through
,
''
replied
Newman
.
``
But
I
*NL*
shall
be
generous
.
I
sha
n't
trouble
him
any
more
.
But
I
am
very
happy
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
stand
still
here
.
Please
to
take
my
arm
and
we
will
go
for
a
*NL*
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
Mrs.
Tristram
through
all
the
rooms
.
There
were
a
great
many
of
*NL*
them
,
and
,
decorated
for
the
occasion
and
filled
with
a
stately
crowd
,
*NL*
their
somewhat
tarnished
nobleness
recovered
its
lustre
.
Mrs.
Tristram
,
*NL*
looking
about
her
,
dropped
a
series
of
softly-incisive
comments
upon
her
*NL*
fellow-guests
.
But
Newman
made
vague
answers
;
he
hardly
heard
her
,
his
*NL*
thoughts
were
elsewhere
.
They
were
lost
in
a
cheerful
sense
of
success
,
*NL*
of
attainment
and
victory
.
His
momentary
care
as
to
whether
he
looked
*NL*
like
a
fool
passed
away
,
leaving
him
simply
with
a
rich
contentment
.
*NL*
He
had
got
what
he
wanted
.
The
savor
of
success
had
always
been
highly
*NL*
agreeable
to
him
,
and
it
had
been
his
fortune
to
know
it
often
.
But
it
*NL*
had
never
before
been
so
sweet
,
been
associated
with
so
much
that
was
*NL*
brilliant
and
suggestive
and
entertaining
.
The
lights
,
the
flowers
,
the
*NL*
music
,
the
crowd
,
the
splendid
women
,
the
jewels
,
the
strangeness
even
*NL*
of
the
universal
murmur
of
a
clever
foreign
tongue
were
all
a
vivid
*NL*
symbol
and
assurance
of
his
having
grasped
his
purpose
and
forced
along
*NL*
his
groove
.
If
Newman
's
smile
was
larger
than
usual
,
it
was
not
tickled
*NL*
vanity
that
pulled
the
strings
;
he
had
no
wish
to
be
shown
with
the
*NL*
finger
or
to
achieve
a
personal
success
.
If
he
could
have
looked
down
at
*NL*
the
scene
,
invisible
,
from
a
hole
in
the
roof
,
he
would
have
enjoyed
it
*NL*
quite
as
much
.
It
would
have
spoken
to
him
about
his
own
prosperity
and
*NL*
deepened
that
easy
feeling
about
life
to
which
,
sooner
or
later
,
he
made
*NL*
all
experience
contribute
.
Just
now
the
cup
seemed
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
pretty
party
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
after
they
had
walked
*NL*
a
while
.
``
I
have
seen
nothing
objectionable
except
my
husband
leaning
*NL*
against
the
wall
and
talking
to
an
individual
whom
I
suppose
he
takes
*NL*
for
a
duke
,
but
whom
I
more
than
suspect
to
be
the
functionary
who
*NL*
attends
to
the
lamps
.
Do
you
think
you
could
separate
them
?
Knock
over
a
*NL*
lamp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
doubt
whether
Newman
,
who
saw
no
harm
in
Tristram
's
conversing
with
an
*NL*
ingenious
mechanic
,
would
have
complied
with
this
request
;
but
at
this
*NL*
moment
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
drew
near
.
Newman
,
some
weeks
previously
,
*NL*
had
presented
Madame
de
Cintre
's
youngest
brother
to
Mrs.
Tristram
,
for
*NL*
whose
merits
Valentin
professed
a
discriminating
relish
and
to
whom
he
*NL*
had
paid
several
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
read
Keats
's
Belle
Dame
sans
Merci
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Tristram
.
*NL*
``
You
remind
me
of
the
hero
of
the
ballad
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
what
can
ail
thee
,
knight-at-arms
,
*NL*
Alone
and
palely

*NL*
``
If
I
am
alone
,
it
is
because
I
have
been
deprived
of
your
society

*NL*
said
Valentin
.
``
Besides
it
is
good
manners
for
no
man
except
Newman
to
*NL*
look
happy

This
is
all
to

It
is
not
for
you

me
to
go
*NL*
before
the
curtain

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promised

last
spring

said
Newman
to
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
that
six
*NL*
months
from
that
time
I
should
get
into
a
monstrous
rage

It
seems
to

me
the
time
's
up
,
and
yet
the
nearest
I
can
come
to
doing
anything
rough
*NL*
now
is
to
offer
you
a
cafe
glace

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
we
should
do
things
grandly

''
said
Valentin
.
``
I
do
n't
allude
*NL*
to
the
cafes
glaces
.
But
every
one
is
here
,
and
my
sister
told
me
just
*NL*
now
that
Urbain
had
been
adorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
he
's
a
good
fellow
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
love
him
as
a
*NL*
brother

That
reminds
me
that
I
ought
to
go
and
say
something
polite
to
*NL*
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
something
very
polite
indeed
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
It
may
be
the
*NL*
last
time
you
will
feel
so
much
like
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
walked
away
,
almost
disposed
to
clasp
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
round
the
waist
.
He
passed
through
several
rooms
and
at
last
found
*NL*
the
old
marquise
in
the
first
saloon
,
seated
on
a
sofa
,
with
her
young
*NL*
kinsman
,
Lord
Deepmere
,
beside
her
.
The
young
man
looked
somewhat
bored
;
*NL*
his
hands
were
thrust
into
his
pockets
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
*NL*
toes
of
his
shoes
,
his
feet
being
thrust
out
in
front
of
him
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
appeared
to
have
been
talking
to
him
with
some
intensity
and
*NL*
to
be
waiting
for
an
answer
to
what
she
had
said
,
or
for
some
sign
of
*NL*
the
effect
of
her
words
.
Her
hands
were
folded
in
her
lap
,
and
she
was
*NL*
looking
at
his
lordship
's
simple
physiognomy
with
an
air
of
politely
*NL*
suppressed
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Deepmere
looked
up
as
Newman
approached
,
met
his
eyes
,
and
changed
*NL*
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
disturb
an
interesting
interview
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
rose
,
and
her
companion
rising
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
she
put
her
hand
into
his
arm
.
She
answered
nothing
for
an
instant
,
and
*NL*
then
,
as
he
remained
silent
,
she
said
with
a
smile
,
``
It
would
be
polite
*NL*
for
Lord
Deepmere
to
say
it
was
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
polite
!
''
cried
his
lordship
.
``
But
it
was
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Bellegarde
was
giving
you
some
good
advice
,
eh
?
''
said
Newman
;
*NL*
``
toning
you
down
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
giving
him
some
excellent
advice
,
''
said
the
marquise
,
fixing
her
*NL*
fresh
,
cold
eyes
upon
our
hero
.
``
It
's
for
him
to
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
sir
--
take
it
,
''
Newman
exclaimed
.
``
Any
advice
the
marquise
*NL*
gives
you
to-night
must
be
good
.
For
to-night
,
marquise
,
you
must
speak
*NL*
from
a
cheerful
,
comfortable
spirit
,
and
that
makes
good
advice
.
You
see
*NL*
everything
going
on
so
brightly
and
successfully
round
you
.
Your
party
*NL*
is
magnificent
;
it
was
a
very
happy
thought
.
It
is
much
better
than
that
*NL*
thing
of
mine
would
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
pleased
I
am
satisfied
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
My
*NL*
desire
was
to
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
please
me
a
little
more
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
Just
drop
*NL*
our
lordly
friend
;
I
am
sure
he
wants
to
be
off
and
shake
his
heels
a
*NL*
little
.
Then
take
my
arm
and
walk
through
the
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
desire
was
to
please
you
,
''
the
old
lady
repeated
.
And
she
liberated
*NL*
Lord
Deepmere
,
Newman
rather
wondering
at
her
docility
.
``
If
this
young
*NL*
man
is
wise
,
''
she
added
,
``
he
will
go
and
find
my
daughter
and
ask
her
to
*NL*
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
indorsing
your
advice
,
''
said
Newman
,
bending
over
her
and
*NL*
laughing
,
``
I
suppose
I
must
swallow
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Deepmere
wiped
his
forehead
and
departed
,
and
Madame
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
took
Newman
's
arm
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
very
pleasant
,
sociable
entertainment
,
''
*NL*
the
latter
declared
,
as
they
proceeded
on
their
circuit
.
``
Every
one
*NL*
seems
to
know
every
one
and
to
be
glad
to
see
every
one
.
The
marquis
has
*NL*
made
me
acquainted
with
ever
so
many
people
,
and
I
feel
quite
like
*NL*
one
of
the
family
.
It
's
an
occasion
,
''
Newman
continued
,
wanting
to
*NL*
say
something
thoroughly
kind
and
comfortable
,
``
that
I
shall
always
*NL*
remember
,
and
remember
very
pleasantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
an
occasion
that
we
shall
none
of
us
forget
,
''
said
the
*NL*
marquise
,
with
her
pure
,
neat
enunciation
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
made
way
for
her
as
she
passed
,
others
turned
round
and
looked
at
*NL*
her
,
and
she
received
a
great
many
greetings
and
pressings
of
the
hand
,
*NL*
all
of
which
she
accepted
with
the
most
delicate
dignity
.
But
though
she
*NL*
smiled
upon
every
one
,
she
said
nothing
until
she
reached
the
last
of
*NL*
the
rooms
,
where
she
found
her
elder
son
.
Then
,
``
This
is
enough
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
she
declared
with
measured
softness
to
Newman
,
and
turned
to
the
*NL*
marquis
.
He
put
out
both
his
hands
and
took
both
hers
,
drawing
her
to
a
*NL*
seat
with
an
air
of
the
tenderest
veneration
.
It
was
a
most
harmonious
*NL*
family
group
,
and
Newman
discreetly
retired
.
He
moved
through
the
rooms
*NL*
for
some
time
longer
,
circulating
freely
,
overtopping
most
people
by
*NL*
his
great
height
,
renewing
acquaintance
with
some
of
the
groups
to
which
*NL*
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
had
presented
him
,
and
expending
generally
the
*NL*
surplus
of
his
equanimity
.
He
continued
to
find
it
all
extremely
*NL*
agreeable
;
but
the
most
agreeable
things
have
an
end
,
and
the
revelry
*NL*
on
this
occasion
began
to
deepen
to
a
close
.
The
music
was
sounding
its
*NL*
ultimate
strains
and
people
were
looking
for
the
marquise
,
to
make
their
*NL*
farewells
.
There
seemed
to
be
some
difficulty
in
finding
her
,
and
Newman
*NL*
heard
a
report
that
she
had
left
the
ball
,
feeling
faint
.
``
She
has
*NL*
succumbed
to
the
emotions
of
the
evening
,
''
he
heard
a
lady
say
.
``
Poor
,
*NL*
dear
marquise
;
I
can
imagine
all
that
they
may
have
been
for
her
!
''
But
*NL*
he
learned
immediately
afterwards
that
she
had
recovered
herself
and
was
*NL*
seated
in
an
armchair
near
the
doorway
,
receiving
parting
compliments
*NL*
from
great
ladies
who
insisted
upon
her
not
rising
.
He
himself
set
out
*NL*
in
quest
of
Madame
de
Cintre
.
He
had
seen
her
move
past
him
many
times
*NL*
in
the
rapid
circles
of
a
waltz
,
but
in
accordance
with
her
explicit
*NL*
instructions
he
had
exchanged
no
words
with
her
since
the
beginning
of
*NL*
the
evening
.
The
whole
house
having
been
thrown
open
,
the
apartments
*NL*
of
the
rez-de-chaussee
were
also
accessible
,
though
a
smaller
number
of
*NL*
persons
had
gathered
there
.
Newman
wandered
through
them
,
observing
*NL*
a
few
scattered
couples
to
whom
this
comparative
seclusion
appeared
*NL*
grateful
and
reached
a
small
conservatory
which
opened
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
The
end
of
the
conservatory
was
formed
by
a
clear
sheet
of
glass
,
*NL*
unmasked
by
plants
,
and
admitting
the
winter
starlight
so
directly
that
*NL*
a
person
standing
there
would
seem
to
have
passed
into
the
open
air
.
Two
*NL*
persons
stood
there
now
,
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
;
the
lady
Newman
,
from
*NL*
within
the
room
and
although
she
had
turned
her
back
to
it
,
immediately
*NL*
recognized
as
Madame
de
Cintre
.
He
hesitated
as
to
whether
he
would
*NL*
advance
,
but
as
he
did
so
she
looked
round
,
feeling
apparently
that
he
*NL*
was
there
.
She
rested
her
eyes
on
him
a
moment
and
then
turned
again
to
*NL*
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
almost
a
pity
not
to
tell
Mr.
Newman
,
''
she
said
softly
,
but
in
a
*NL*
tone
that
Newman
could
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
if
you
like
!
''
the
gentleman
answered
,
in
the
voice
of
Lord
*NL*
Deepmere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
tell
me
by
all
means
!
''
said
Newman
advancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Deepmere
,
he
observed
,
was
very
red
in
the
face
,
and
he
had
twisted
*NL*
his
gloves
into
a
tight
cord
as
if
he
had
been
squeezing
them
dry
.
*NL*
These
,
presumably
,
were
tokens
of
violent
emotion
,
and
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Newman
that
the
traces
of
corresponding
agitation
were
visible
in
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
's
face
.
The
two
had
been
talking
with
much
vivacity
.
``
What
*NL*
I
should
tell
you
is
only
to
my
lord
's
credit
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
*NL*
smiling
frankly
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
like
it
any
better
for
that
!
''
said
my
lord
,
with
his
*NL*
awkward
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
;
what
's
the
mystery
?
''
Newman
demanded
.
``
Clear
it
up
.
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
mysteries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
have
some
things
we
do
n't
like
,
and
go
without
some
we
do
,
''
*NL*
said
the
ruddy
young
nobleman
,
laughing
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
to
Lord
Deepmere
's
credit
,
but
it
is
not
to
every
one
's
,
''
said
*NL*
Madam
de
Cintre
.
``
So
I
shall
say
nothing
about
it
.
You
may
be
sure
,
''
*NL*
she
added
;
and
she
put
out
her
hand
to
the
Englishman
,
who
took
it
half
*NL*
shyly
,
half
impetuously
.
``
And
now
go
and
dance
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
I
feel
awfully
like
dancing
!
''
he
answered
.
``
I
shall
go
and
get
*NL*
tipsy
.
''
And
he
walked
away
with
a
gloomy
guffaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
between
you
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
--
now
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
Nothing
that
need
make
*NL*
you
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
little
Englishman
been
trying
to
make
love
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
,
and
then
she
uttered
a
grave
``
No
!
he
's
a
very
honest
*NL*
little
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
agitated
.
Something
is
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
I
repeat
,
that
need
make
you
unhappy
.
My
agitation
is
over
.
*NL*
Some
day
I
will
tell
you
what
it
was
;
not
now
.
I
ca
n't
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
confess
,
''
remarked
Newman
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
anything
*NL*
unpleasant
.
I
am
satisfied
with
everything
--
most
of
all
with
you
.
I
*NL*
have
seen
all
the
ladies
and
talked
with
a
great
many
of
them
;
but
I
am
*NL*
satisfied
with
you
.
''
Madame
de
Cintre
covered
him
for
a
moment
with
her
*NL*
large
,
soft
glance
,
and
then
turned
her
eyes
away
into
the
starry
night
.
*NL*
So
they
stood
silent
a
moment
,
side
by
side
.
``
Say
you
are
satisfied
with
*NL*
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
wait
a
moment
for
the
answer
;
but
it
came
at
last
,
low
yet
*NL*
distinct
:
``
I
am
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
presently
followed
by
a
few
words
from
another
source
,
which
made
*NL*
them
both
turn
round
.
``
I
am
sadly
afraid
Madame
de
Cintre
will
take
a
*NL*
chill
.
I
have
ventured
to
bring
a
shawl
.
''
Mrs.
Bread
stood
there
softly
*NL*
solicitous
,
holding
a
white
drapery
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
the
sight
of
those
cold
stars
gives
*NL*
one
a
sense
of
frost
.
I
wo
n't
take
your
shawl
,
but
we
will
go
back
into
*NL*
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
back
and
Newman
followed
her
,
Mrs.
Bread
standing
*NL*
respectfully
aside
to
make
way
for
them
.
Newman
paused
an
instant
before
*NL*
the
old
woman
,
and
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
a
silent
greeting
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
come
and
live
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
sir
,
if
you
will
,
''
she
answered
,
``
you
have
not
seen
the
last
*NL*
of
me
!

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
fond
of
music
and
went
often
to
the
opera
.
A
couple
of
*NL*
evenings
after
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
ball
he
sat
listening
to
``
Don
*NL*
Giovanni
,
''
having
in
honor
of
this
work
,
which
he
had
never
yet
seen
*NL*
represented
,
come
to
occupy
his
orchestra-chair
before
the
rising
of
*NL*
the
curtain
.
Frequently
he
took
a
large
box
and
invited
a
party
of
*NL*
his
compatriots
;
this
was
a
mode
of
recreation
to
which
he
was
much
*NL*
addicted
.
He
liked
making
up
parties
of
his
friends
and
conducting
them
*NL*
to
the
theatre
,
and
taking
them
to
drive
on
high
drags
or
to
dine
at
*NL*
remote
restaurants
.
He
liked
doing
things
which
involved
his
paying
for
*NL*
people
;
the
vulgar
truth
is
that
he
enjoyed
``
treating
''
them
.
This
was
*NL*
not
because
he
was
what
is
called
purse-proud
;
handling
money
in
public
*NL*
was
on
the
contrary
positively
disagreeable
to
him
;
he
had
a
sort
of
*NL*
personal
modesty
about
it
,
akin
to
what
he
would
have
felt
about
making
*NL*
a
toilet
before
spectators
.
But
just
as
it
was
a
gratification
to
him
to
*NL*
be
handsomely
dressed
,
just
so
it
was
a
private
satisfaction
to
him
-LRB-
he
*NL*
enjoyed
it
very
clandestinely
-RRB-
to
have
interposed
,
pecuniarily
,
in
*NL*
a
scheme
of
pleasure
.
To
set
a
large
group
of
people
in
motion
and
*NL*
transport
them
to
a
distance
,
to
have
special
conveyances
,
to
charter
*NL*
railway-carriages
and
steamboats
,
harmonized
with
his
relish
for
*NL*
bold
processes
,
and
made
hospitality
seem
more
active
and
more
to
the
*NL*
purpose
.
A
few
evenings
before
the
occasion
of
which
I
speak
he
had
*NL*
invited
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
the
opera
to
listen
to
Madame
*NL*
Alboni
--
a
party
which
included
Miss
Dora
Finch
.
It
befell
,
however
,
that
*NL*
Miss
Dora
Finch
,
sitting
near
Newman
in
the
box
,
discoursed
brilliantly
,
*NL*
not
only
during
the
entr
`
actes
,
but
during
many
of
the
finest
portions
*NL*
of
the
performance
,
so
that
Newman
had
really
come
away
with
an
*NL*
irritated
sense
that
Madame
Alboni
had
a
thin
,
shrill
voice
,
and
that
*NL*
her
musical
phrase
was
much
garnished
with
a
laugh
of
the
giggling
*NL*
order
.
After
this
he
promised
himself
to
go
for
a
while
to
the
opera
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
curtain
had
fallen
upon
the
first
act
of
``
Don
Giovanni
''
he
*NL*
turned
round
in
his
place
to
observe
the
house
.
Presently
,
in
one
of
*NL*
the
boxes
,
he
perceived
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
and
his
wife
.
The
little
*NL*
marquise
was
sweeping
the
house
very
busily
with
a
glass
,
and
Newman
,
*NL*
supposing
that
she
saw
him
,
determined
to
go
and
bid
her
good
evening
.
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
was
leaning
against
a
column
,
motionless
,
looking
*NL*
straight
in
front
of
him
,
with
one
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
white
*NL*
waistcoat
and
the
other
resting
his
hat
on
his
thigh
.
Newman
was
about
*NL*
to
leave
his
place
when
he
noticed
in
that
obscure
region
devoted
to
the
*NL*
small
boxes
which
in
France
are
called
,
not
inaptly
,
``
bathing-tubs
,
''
*NL*
a
face
which
even
the
dim
light
and
the
distance
could
not
make
wholly
*NL*
indistinct
.
It
was
the
face
of
a
young
and
pretty
woman
,
and
it
was
*NL*
surmounted
with
a
coiffure
of
pink
roses
and
diamonds
.
This
person
was
*NL*
looking
round
the
house
,
and
her
fan
was
moving
to
and
fro
with
the
most
*NL*
practiced
grace
;
when
she
lowered
it
,
Newman
perceived
a
pair
of
plump
*NL*
white
shoulders
and
the
edge
of
a
rose-colored
dress
.
Beside
her
,
very
*NL*
close
to
the
shoulders
and
talking
,
apparently
with
an
earnestness
which
*NL*
it
pleased
her
scantily
to
heed
,
sat
a
young
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
*NL*
very
low
shirt-collar
.
A
moment
's
gazing
left
Newman
with
no
doubts
;
the
*NL*
pretty
young
woman
was
Noemie
Nioche
.
He
looked
hard
into
the
depths
of
*NL*
the
box
,
thinking
her
father
might
perhaps
be
in
attendance
,
but
from
*NL*
what
he
could
see
the
young
man
's
eloquence
had
no
other
auditor
.
*NL*
Newman
at
last
made
his
way
out
,
and
in
doing
so
he
passed
beneath
the
*NL*
baignoire
of
Mademoiselle
Noemie
.
She
saw
him
as
he
approached
and
gave
*NL*
him
a
nod
and
smile
which
seemed
meant
as
an
assurance
that
she
was
*NL*
still
a
good-natured
girl
,
in
spite
of
her
enviable
rise
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Newman
passed
into
the
foyer
and
walked
through
it
.
Suddenly
he
paused
*NL*
in
front
of
a
gentleman
seated
on
one
of
the
divans
.
The
gentleman
's
*NL*
elbows
were
on
his
knees
;
he
was
leaning
forward
and
staring
at
the
*NL*
pavement
,
lost
apparently
in
meditations
of
a
somewhat
gloomy
cast
.
But
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
bent
head
Newman
recognized
him
,
and
in
a
moment
*NL*
sat
down
beside
him
.
Then
the
gentleman
looked
up
and
displayed
the
*NL*
expressive
countenance
of
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
world
are
you
thinking
of
so
hard
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
subject
that
requires
hard
thinking
to
do
it
justice
,
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
``
My
immeasurable
idiocy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
matter
now
is
that
I
am
a
man
again
,
and
no
more
a
fool
than
usual
.
*NL*
But
I
came
within
an
inch
of
taking
that
girl
au
serieux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
young
lady
below
stairs
,
in
a
baignoire
in
a
pink
dress
?
''
*NL*
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
what
a
brilliant
kind
of
pink
it
was
?
''
Valentin
*NL*
inquired
,
by
way
of
answer
.
``
It
makes
her
look
as
white
as
new
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
White
or
black
,
as
you
please
.
But
you
have
stopped
going
to
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
bless
you
,
no
.
Why
should
I
stop
?
I
have
changed
,
but
she
has
n't
,
''
*NL*
said
Valentin
.
``
I
see
she
is
a
vulgar
little
wretch
,
after
all
.
But
she
*NL*
is
as
amusing
as
ever
,
and
one
MUST
be
amused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
she
strikes
you
so
unpleasantly
,
''
Newman
rejoiced
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
you
have
swallowed
all
those
fine
words
you
used
about
her
*NL*
the
other
night
.
You
compared
her
to
a
sapphire
,
or
a
topaz
,
or
an
*NL*
amethyst
--
some
precious
stone
;
what
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
it
may
have
been
to
a
carbuncle
!
But
*NL*
she
wo
n't
make
a
fool
of
me
now
.
She
has
no
real
charm
.
It
's
an
awfully
*NL*
low
thing
to
make
a
mistake
about
a
person
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
congratulate
you
,
''
Newman
declared
,
``
upon
the
scales
having
fallen
*NL*
from
your
eyes
.
It
's
a
great
triumph
;
it
ought
to
make
you
feel
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
makes
me
feel
better
!
''
said
Valentin
,
gayly
.
Then
,
checking
*NL*
himself
,
he
looked
askance
at
Newman
.
``
I
rather
think
you
are
laughing
*NL*
at
me
.
If
you
were
not
one
of
the
family
I
would
take
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
not
laughing
,
any
more
than
I
am
one
of
the
family
.
You
*NL*
make
me
feel
badly
.
You
are
too
clever
a
fellow
,
you
are
made
of
too
*NL*
good
stuff
,
to
spend
your
time
in
ups
and
downs
over
that
class
of
*NL*
goods
.
The
idea
of
splitting
hairs
about
Miss
Nioche
!
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
awfully
foolish
.
You
say
you
have
given
up
taking
her
seriously
;
but
you
*NL*
take
her
seriously
so
long
as
you
take
her
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
turned
round
in
his
place
and
looked
a
while
at
Newman
,
*NL*
wrinkling
his
forehead
and
rubbing
his
knees
.
``
Vous
parlez
d'or
.
But
*NL*
she
has
wonderfully
pretty
arms
.
Would
you
believe
I
did
n't
know
it
till
*NL*
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
a
vulgar
little
wretch
,
remember
,
all
the
same
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
the
other
day
she
had
the
bad
taste
to
begin
to
abuse
her
father
,
*NL*
to
his
face
,
in
my
presence
.
I
should
n't
have
expected
it
of
her
;
it
was
*NL*
a
disappointment
;
heigho
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
she
cares
no
more
for
her
father
than
for
her
door-mat
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
``
I
discovered
that
the
first
time
I
saw
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
another
affair
;
she
may
think
of
the
poor
old
beggar
what
*NL*
she
pleases
.
But
it
was
low
in
her
to
call
him
bad
names
;
it
quite
threw
*NL*
me
off
.
It
was
about
a
frilled
petticoat
that
he
was
to
have
fetched
*NL*
from
the
washer-woman
's
;
he
appeared
to
have
neglected
this
graceful
*NL*
duty
.
She
almost
boxed
his
ears
.
He
stood
there
staring
at
her
with
his
*NL*
little
blank
eyes
and
smoothing
his
old
hat
with
his
coat-tail
.
At
last
*NL*
he
turned
round
and
went
out
without
a
word
.
Then
I
told
her
it
was
*NL*
in
very
bad
taste
to
speak
so
to
one
's
papa
.
She
said
she
should
be
so
*NL*
thankful
to
me
if
I
would
mention
it
to
her
whenever
her
taste
was
at
*NL*
fault
;
she
had
immense
confidence
in
mine
.
I
told
her
I
could
n't
have
*NL*
the
bother
of
forming
her
manners
;
I
had
had
an
idea
they
were
already
*NL*
formed
,
after
the
best
models
.
She
had
disappointed
me
.
But
I
shall
get
*NL*
over
it
,
''
said
Valentin
,
gayly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
time
's
a
great
consoler
!
''
Newman
answered
with
humorous
sobriety
.
*NL*
He
was
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
he
added
,
in
another
tone
,
``
I
wish
you
*NL*
would
think
of
what
I
said
to
you
the
other
day

Come
over
to
America
*NL*
with
us
,
and
I
will
put
you
in
the
way
of
doing
some
business
.
You
have
*NL*
a
very
good
head
,
if
you
will
only
use
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
made
a
genial
grimace
.
``
My
head
is
much
obliged
to
you

Do
you
*NL*
mean
the
place
in
a
bank
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
several
places
,
but
I
suppose
you
would
consider
the
bank
the
*NL*
most
aristocratic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
burst
into
a
laugh
.
``
My
dear
fellow
,
at
night
all
cats
are
*NL*
gray
!
When
one
derogates
there
are
no
degrees

*NL*
*NL*
Newman
answered
nothing
for
a
minute
.
Then
,
``
I
think
you
will
find
there
*NL*
are
degrees
in
success

''
he
said
with
a
certain
dryness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
had
leaned
forward
again
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
and
he
*NL*
was
scratching
the
pavement
with
his
stick
.
At
last
he
said
,
looking
up
,
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
I
ought
to
do
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
laid
his
hand
on
his
companion
's
arm
and
looked
at
him
a
moment
*NL*
through
sagaciously-narrowed
eyelids
.
``
Try
it
and
see
.
You
are
not
good
*NL*
enough
for
it

we
will
stretch
a
point

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
I
can
make
some
money
?
I
should
like
to
see
how
it
*NL*
feels
to
have
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
I
tell
you
,
and
you
shall
be
rich

said
Newman
.
``
Think
of
it

''
*NL*
And
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
prepared
to
resume
his
way
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
's
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
I
will
think
of
it
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
I
will
go
and
listen
*NL*
to
Mozart
another
half
hour

I
can
always
think
better
to
music

*NL*
profoundly
meditate
upon
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
was
with
his
wife
when
Newman
entered
their
box
;
he
was
*NL*
bland
,
remote
,
and
correct
as
usual
;
or
,
as
it
seemed
to
Newman
,
even
*NL*
more
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
the
opera
?
''
asked
our
hero
.
``
What
do
you
think

*NL*
the
Don

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
all

what
Mozart
is

''
said
the
marquis
;
``
our
impressions
*NL*
do
n't
date
from
this
evening

Mozart
is
youth

freshness

brilliancy

*NL*
facility
--
a
little
too
great
facility
,
perhaps
.
But
the
execution
is
*NL*
here
and
there
deplorably
rough

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
curious
to
see
how
it
ends

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
as

the

``
You
have
surely
seen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

said
Newman
.
``
I
am
sure
I
should
have
remembered
it

Donna
Elvira
reminds
me
of
Madame

do
n't
mean
in

circumstances

in
the
music
she
sings

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
very
nice
distinction

laughed
the
marquis
lightly
.
``
There
is
*NL*
no

*NL*
``
Not
much

said
Newman

But
what
becomes
of
the
Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
comes
down

comes
up

said
Madame
de

,
``
and

carries
him
off

I
suppose

``
I
will
go
to

*NL*
And
he
passed
out
of
the
box
.

*NL*
The
little
marquise
stared
an
instant
at
the
velvet
ledge
of
the
*NL*
balcony
,
and
then
murmured
,
``
Not
a

Newman
*NL*
had
taken
her
husband
's
empty
chair
.
She
made
no
protest
,
and
then
she
*NL*
turned
suddenly
and
laid
her
closed
fan
upon
his
arm
.
``
I
am
very
glad
*NL*
you
came
in
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
want
to
ask
you
a
favor
.
I
wanted
to
do
so
on
*NL*
Thursday
,
at
my
mother-in-law
's
ball
,
but
you
would
give
me
no
chance
.
*NL*
You
were
in
such
very
good
spirits
that
I
thought
you
might
grant
my
*NL*
little
favor
then
;
not
that
you
look
particularly
doleful
now
.
It
is
*NL*
something
you
must
promise
me
;
now
is
the
time
to
take
you
;
after
you
*NL*
are
married
you
will
be
good
for
nothing
.
Come
,
promise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
sign
a
paper
without
reading
it
first
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Show
me
*NL*
your
document
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
must
sign
with
your
eyes
shut
;
I
will
hold
your
hand
.
Come
,
*NL*
before
you
put
your
head
into
the
noose
.
You
ought
to
be
thankful
to
me
*NL*
for
giving
you
a
chance
to
do
something
amusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
so
amusing
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
it
will
be
in
even
better
season
*NL*
after
I
am
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
other
words
,
''
cried
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
you
will
not
do
it
at
*NL*
all
.
You
will
be
afraid
of
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
the
thing
is
intrinsically
improper
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
wo
n't
go
*NL*
into
it
.
If
it
is
not
,
I
will
do
it
after
my
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
like
a
treatise
on
logic
,
and
English
logic
into
the
bargain
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
Promise
,
then
,
after
you
are
married
.
*NL*
After
all
,
I
shall
enjoy
keeping
you
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
after
I
am
married
,
''
said
Newman
serenely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
marquise
hesitated
a
moment
,
looking
at
him
,
and
he
wondered
*NL*
what
was
coming
.
``
I
suppose
you
know
what
my
life
is
,
''
she
presently
*NL*
said
.
``
I
have
no
pleasure
,
I
see
nothing
,
I
do
nothing
.
I
live
in
Paris
*NL*
as
I
might
live
at
Poitiers
.
My
mother-in-law
calls
me
--
what
is
the
*NL*
pretty
word
?
--
a
gad-about
?
accuses
me
of
going
to
unheard-of
places
,
and
*NL*
thinks
it
ought
to
be
joy
enough
for
me
to
sit
at
home
and
count
over
my
*NL*
ancestors
on
my
fingers
.
But
why
should
I
bother
about
my
ancestors
?
*NL*
I
am
sure
they
never
bothered
about
me
.
I
do
n't
propose
to
live
with
*NL*
a
green
shade
on
my
eyes
;
I
hold
that
things
were
made
to
look
at
.
My
*NL*
husband
,
you
know
,
has
principles
,
and
the
first
on
the
list
is
that
*NL*
the
Tuileries
are
dreadfully
vulgar
.
If
the
Tuileries
are
vulgar
,
his
*NL*
principles
are
tiresome
.
If
I
chose
I
might
have
principles
quite
as
*NL*
well
as
he
.
If
they
grew
on
one
's
family
tree
I
should
only
have
to
give
*NL*
mine
a
shake
to
bring
down
a
shower
of
the
finest
.
At
any
rate
,
I
prefer
*NL*
clever
Bonapartes
to
stupid
Bourbons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
;
you
want
to
go
to
court
,
''
said
Newman
,
vaguely
conjecturing
*NL*
that
she
might
wish
him
to
appeal
to
the
United
States
legation
to
*NL*
smooth
her
way
to
the
imperial
halls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
gave
a
little
sharp
laugh
.
``
You
are
a
thousand
miles
away
.
*NL*
I
will
take
care
of
the
Tuileries
myself
;
the
day
I
decide
to
go
they
*NL*
will
be
very
glad
to
have
me
.
Sooner
or
later
I
shall
dance
in
an
*NL*
imperial
quadrille
.
I
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
:
`
How
will
you
*NL*
dare
?
'
But
I
SHALL
dare
.
I
am
afraid
of
my
husband
;
he
is
soft
,
*NL*
smooth
,
irreproachable
;
everything
that
you
know
;
but
I
am
afraid
of
*NL*
him
--
horribly
afraid
of
him
.
And
yet
I
shall
arrive
at
the
Tuileries
.
*NL*
But
that
will
not
be
this
winter
,
nor
perhaps
next
,
and
meantime
I
must
*NL*
live
.
For
the
moment
,
I
want
to
go
somewhere
else
;
it
's
my
dream
.
I
want
*NL*
to
go
to
the
Bal
Bullier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Bal
Bullier
?
''
repeated
Newman
,
for
whom
the
words
at
first
meant
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ball
in
the
Latin
Quarter
,
where
the
students
dance
with
their
*NL*
mistresses
.
Do
n't
tell
me
you
have
not
heard
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
I
have
heard
of
it
;
I
remember
now
.
I
have
even
*NL*
been
there
.
And
you
want
to
go
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
silly
,
it
is
low
,
it
is
anything
you
please
.
But
I
want
to
go
.
*NL*
Some
of
my
friends
have
been
,
and
they
say
it
is
awfully
drole
.
My
*NL*
friends
go
everywhere
;
it
is
only
I
who
sit
moping
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
you
are
not
at
home
now
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
and
I
should
n't
*NL*
exactly
say
you
were
moping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bored
to
death
.
I
have
been
to
the
opera
twice
a
week
for
the
last
*NL*
eight
years
.
Whenever
I
ask
for
anything
my
mouth
is
stopped
with
that
:
*NL*
Pray
,
madam
,
have
n't
you
an
opera
box
?
Could
a
woman
of
taste
want
more
?
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
my
opera
box
was
down
in
my
contrat
;
they
have
*NL*
to
give
it
to
me
.
To-night
,
for
instance
,
I
should
have
preferred
a
*NL*
thousand
times
to
go
to
the
Palais
Royal
.
But
my
husband
wo
n't
go
to
the
*NL*
Palais
Royal
because
the
ladies
of
the
court
go
there
so
much
.
You
may
*NL*
imagine
,
then
,
whether
he
would
take
me
to
Bullier
's
;
he
says
it
is
*NL*
a
mere
imitation
--
and
a
bad
one
--
of
what
they
do
at
the
Princess
*NL*
Kleinfuss
's
.
But
as
I
do
n't
go
to
the
Princess
Kleinfuss
's
,
the
next
*NL*
best
thing
is
to
go
to
Bullier
's
.
It
is
my
dream
,
at
any
rate
,
it
's
*NL*
a
fixed
idea
.
All
I
ask
of
you
is
to
give
me
your
arm
;
you
are
less
*NL*
compromising
than
any
one
else
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
but
you
are
.
I
can
*NL*
arrange
it
.
I
shall
risk
something
,
but
that
is
my
own
affair
.
Besides
,
*NL*
fortune
favors
the
bold
.
Do
n't
refuse
me
;
it
is
my
dream
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
loud
laugh
.
It
seemed
to
him
hardly
worth
while
to
be
the
*NL*
wife
of
the
Marquis
de
Bellegarde
,
a
daughter
of
the
crusaders
,
heiress
*NL*
of
six
centuries
of
glories
and
traditions
,
to
have
centred
one
's
*NL*
aspirations
upon
the
sight
of
a
couple
of
hundred
young
ladies
kicking
*NL*
off
young
men
's
hats
.
It
struck
him
as
a
theme
for
the
moralist
;
but
*NL*
he
had
no
time
to
moralize
upon
it
.
The
curtain
rose
again
;
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
returned
,
and
Newman
went
back
to
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
observed
that
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
had
taken
his
place
in
the
*NL*
baignoire
of
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
behind
this
young
lady
and
her
*NL*
companion
,
where
he
was
visible
only
if
one
carefully
looked
for
him
.
*NL*
In
the
next
act
Newman
met
him
in
the
lobby
and
asked
him
if
he
had
*NL*
reflected
upon
possible
emigration
.
``
If
you
really
meant
to
meditate
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
you
might
have
chosen
a
better
place
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
place
was
not
bad
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
I
was
not
thinking
of
that
*NL*
girl
.
I
listened
to
the
music
,
and
,
without
thinking
of
the
play
or
*NL*
looking
at
the
stage
,
I
turned
over
your
proposal
.
At
first
it
seemed
*NL*
quite
fantastic
.
And
then
a
certain
fiddle
in
the
orchestra
--
I
could
*NL*
distinguish
it
--
began
to
say
as
it
scraped
away
,
`
Why
not
,
why
not
?
'
*NL*
And
then
,
in
that
rapid
movement
,
all
the
fiddles
took
it
up
and
the
*NL*
conductor
's
stick
seemed
to
beat
it
in
the
air
:
`
Why
not
,
why
not
?
'
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
ca
n't
say
!
I
do
n't
see
why
not
.
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
n't
do
*NL*
something
.
It
appears
to
me
really
a
very
bright
idea
.
This
sort
of
*NL*
thing
is
certainly
very
stale
.
And
then
I
could
come
back
with
a
trunk
*NL*
full
of
dollars
.
Besides
,
I
might
possibly
find
it
amusing
.
They
call
me
*NL*
a
raffine
;
who
knows
but
that
I
might
discover
an
unsuspected
charm
in
*NL*
shop-keeping
?
It
would
really
have
a
certain
romantic
,
picturesque
side
;
*NL*
it
would
look
well
in
my
biography
.
It
would
look
as
if
I
were
a
strong
*NL*
man
,
a
first-rate
man
,
a
man
who
dominated
circumstances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
how
it
would
look
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
always
looks
well
to
*NL*
have
half
a
million
of
dollars
.
There
is
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
*NL*
have
them
if
you
will
mind
what
I
tell
you
--
I
alone
--
and
not
talk
to
*NL*
other
parties
.
''
He
passed
his
arm
into
that
of
his
companion
,
and
*NL*
the
two
walked
for
some
time
up
and
down
one
of
the
less
frequented
*NL*
corridors
.
Newman
's
imagination
began
to
glow
with
the
idea
of
*NL*
converting
his
bright
,
impracticable
friend
into
a
first-class
man
of
*NL*
business
.
He
felt
for
the
moment
a
sort
of
spiritual
zeal
,
the
zeal
*NL*
of
the
propagandist
.
Its
ardor
was
in
part
the
result
of
that
general
*NL*
discomfort
which
the
sight
of
all
uninvested
capital
produced
in
him
;
so
*NL*
fine
an
intelligence
as
Bellegarde
's
ought
to
be
dedicated
to
high
uses
.
*NL*
The
highest
uses
known
to
Newman
's
experience
were
certain
transcendent
*NL*
sagacities
in
the
handling
of
railway
stock
.
And
then
his
zeal
was
*NL*
quickened
by
his
personal
kindness
for
Valentin
;
he
had
a
sort
of
pity
*NL*
for
him
which
he
was
well
aware
he
never
could
have
made
the
Comte
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
understand
.
He
never
lost
a
sense
of
its
being
pitiable
that
*NL*
Valentin
should
think
it
a
large
life
to
revolve
in
varnished
boots
*NL*
between
the
Rue
d'Anjou
and
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
,
taking
the
*NL*
Boulevard
des
Italiens
on
the
way
,
when
over
there
in
America
one
's
*NL*
promenade
was
a
continent
,
and
one
's
Boulevard
stretched
from
New
York
*NL*
to
San
Francisco
.
It
mortified
him
,
moreover
,
to
think
that
Valentin
*NL*
lacked
money
;
there
was
a
painful
grotesqueness
in
it
.
It
affected
him
*NL*
as
the
ignorance
of
a
companion
,
otherwise
without
reproach
,
touching
*NL*
some
rudimentary
branch
of
learning
would
have
done
.
There
were
things
*NL*
that
one
knew
about
as
a
matter
of
course
,
he
would
have
said
in
such
a
*NL*
case
.
Just
so
,
if
one
pretended
to
be
easy
in
the
world
,
one
had
money
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
course
,
one
had
made
it
!
There
was
something
almost
*NL*
ridiculously
anomalous
to
Newman
in
the
sight
of
lively
pretensions
*NL*
unaccompanied
by
large
investments
in
railroads
;
though
I
may
add
that
*NL*
he
would
not
have
maintained
that
such
investments
were
in
themselves
a
*NL*
proper
ground
for
pretensions
.
``
I
will
make
you
do
something
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
Valentin
;
``
I
will
put
you
through
.
I
know
half
a
dozen
things
in
*NL*
which
we
can
make
a
place
for
you
.
You
will
see
some
lively
work
.
It
*NL*
will
take
you
a
little
while
to
get
used
to
the
life
,
but
you
will
work
*NL*
in
before
long
,
and
at
the
end
of
six
months
--
after
you
have
done
a
*NL*
thing
or
two
on
your
own
account
--
you
will
like
it
.
And
then
it
will
*NL*
be
very
pleasant
for
you
,
having
your
sister
over
there
.
It
will
be
*NL*
pleasant
for
her
to
have
you
,
too
.
Yes
,
Valentin
,
''
continued
Newman
,
*NL*
pressing
his
friend
's
arm
genially
,
``
I
think
I
see
just
the
opening
for
*NL*
you
.
Keep
quiet
and
I
'll
push
you
right
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
pursued
this
favoring
strain
for
some
time
longer
.
The
two
*NL*
men
strolled
about
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Valentin
listened
and
*NL*
questioned
,
many
of
his
questions
making
Newman
laugh
loud
at
the
*NL*
naivete
of
his
ignorance
of
the
vulgar
processes
of
money-getting
;
*NL*
smiling
himself
,
too
,
half
ironical
and
half
curious
.
And
yet
he
was
*NL*
serious
;
he
was
fascinated
by
Newman
's
plain
prose
version
of
the
legend
*NL*
of
El
Dorado
.
It
is
true
,
however
,
that
though
to
accept
an
``
opening
''
*NL*
in
an
American
mercantile
house
might
be
a
bold
,
original
,
and
in
its
*NL*
consequences
extremely
agreeable
thing
to
do
,
he
did
not
quite
see
*NL*
himself
objectively
doing
it
.
So
that
when
the
bell
rang
to
indicate
the
*NL*
close
of
the
entr
`
acte
,
there
was
a
certain
mock-heroism
in
his
saying
,
*NL*
with
his
brilliant
smile
,
``
Well
,
then
,
put
me
through
;
push
me
in
!
I
*NL*
make
myself
over
to
you
.
Dip
me
into
the
pot
and
turn
me
into
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
passed
into
the
corridor
which
encircled
the
row
of
baignoires
,
*NL*
and
Valentin
stopped
in
front
of
the
dusky
little
box
in
which
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
had
bestowed
herself
,
laying
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
doorknob
.
``
Oh
,
come
,
are
you
going
back
there
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
Dieu
,
oui
,
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
another
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
my
usual
place
,
in
the
stalls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
go
and
occupy
it
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
her
very
well
from
there
,
too
,
''
added
Valentin
,
serenely
,
``
and
*NL*
to-night
she
is
worth
seeing
.
But
,
''
he
added
in
a
moment
,
``
I
have
a
*NL*
particular
reason
for
going
back
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
give
you
up
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
are
infatuated
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
only
this
.
There
is
a
young
man
in
the
box
whom
I
shall
annoy
*NL*
by
going
in
,
and
I
want
to
annoy
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Ca
n't
you
leave
the
poor
fellow
*NL*
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
has
given
me
cause
.
The
box
is
not
his
.
Noemie
came
in
alone
*NL*
and
installed
herself
.
I
went
and
spoke
to
her
,
and
in
a
few
moments
she
*NL*
asked
me
to
go
and
get
her
fan
from
the
pocket
of
her
cloak
,
which
the
*NL*
ouvreuse
had
carried
off
.
In
my
absence
this
gentleman
came
in
and
took
*NL*
the
chair
beside
Noemie
in
which
I
had
been
sitting
.
My
reappearance
*NL*
disgusted
him
,
and
he
had
the
grossness
to
show
it
.
He
came
within
an
*NL*
ace
of
being
impertinent
.
I
do
n't
know
who
he
is
;
he
is
some
vulgar
*NL*
wretch
.
I
ca
n't
think
where
she
picks
up
such
acquaintances
.
He
has
been
*NL*
drinking
,
too
,
but
he
knows
what
he
is
about
.
Just
now
,
in
the
second
*NL*
act
,
he
was
unmannerly
again
.
I
shall
put
in
another
appearance
for
ten
*NL*
minutes
--
time
enough
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
commit
himself
,
if
he
*NL*
feels
inclined
.
I
really
ca
n't
let
the
brute
suppose
that
he
is
keeping
*NL*
me
out
of
the
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
''
said
Newman
,
remonstrantly
,
``
what
child
's
play
!
You
*NL*
are
not
going
to
pick
a
quarrel
about
that
girl
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
girl
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
and
I
have
no
intention
of
picking
*NL*
a
quarrel
.
I
am
not
a
bully
nor
a
fire-eater
.
I
simply
wish
to
make
a
*NL*
point
that
a
gentleman
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
your
point
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
That
is
the
trouble
with
you
*NL*
Frenchmen
;
you
must
be
always
making
points
.
Well
,
''
he
added
,
``
be
short
.
*NL*
But
if
you
are
going
in
for
this
kind
of
thing
,
we
must
ship
you
off
to
*NL*
America
in
advance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
Valentin
answered
,
``
whenever
you
please
.
But
if
I
go
to
*NL*
America
,
I
must
not
let
this
gentleman
suppose
that
it
is
to
run
away
*NL*
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
separated
.
At
the
end
of
the
act
Newman
observed
that
Valentin
*NL*
was
still
in
the
baignoire
.
He
strolled
into
the
corridor
again
,
*NL*
expecting
to
meet
him
,
and
when
he
was
within
a
few
yards
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
's
box
saw
his
friend
pass
out
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
the
young
man
who
had
been
seated
beside
its
fair
occupant
.
The
two
*NL*
gentlemen
walked
with
some
quickness
of
step
to
a
distant
part
of
the
*NL*
lobby
,
where
Newman
perceived
them
stop
and
stand
talking
.
The
manner
*NL*
of
each
was
perfectly
quiet
,
but
the
stranger
,
who
looked
flushed
,
had
*NL*
begun
to
wipe
his
face
very
emphatically
with
his
pocket-handkerchief
.
*NL*
By
this
time
Newman
was
abreast
of
the
baignoire
;
the
door
had
been
*NL*
left
ajar
,
and
he
could
see
a
pink
dress
inside
.
He
immediately
went
in
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
turned
and
greeted
him
with
a
brilliant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
at
last
decided
to
come
and
see
me
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
You
*NL*
just
save
your
politeness
.
You
find
me
in
a
fine
moment
.
Sit
down
.
''
*NL*
There
was
a
very
becoming
little
flush
in
her
cheek
,
and
her
eye
had
a
*NL*
noticeable
spark
.
You
would
have
said
that
she
had
received
some
very
*NL*
good
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
has
happened
here
!
''
said
Newman
,
without
sitting
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
me
in
a
very
fine
moment
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
Two
gentlemen
--
one
*NL*
of
them
is
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
the
pleasure
of
whose
acquaintance
I
owe
to
*NL*
you
--
have
just
had
words
about
your
humble
servant
.
Very
big
words
too
.
*NL*
They
ca
n't
come
off
without
crossing
swords
.
A
duel
--
that
will
give
me
*NL*
a
push
!
''
cried
Mademoiselle
Noemie
clapping
her
little
hands
.
``
C'est
ca
*NL*
qui
pose
une
femme
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
Bellegarde
is
going
to
fight
about
YOU
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Newman
,
disgustedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
else
!
''
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
hard
little
smile
.
``
No
,
*NL*
no
,
you
are
not
galant
!
And
if
you
prevent
this
affair
I
shall
owe
you
a
*NL*
grudge
--
and
pay
my
debt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
uttered
an
imprecation
which
,
though
brief
--
it
consisted
simply
*NL*
of
the
interjection
``
Oh
!
''
followed
by
a
geographical
,
or
more
*NL*
correctly
,
perhaps
a
theological
noun
in
four
letters
--
had
better
not
*NL*
be
transferred
to
these
pages
.
He
turned
his
back
without
more
ceremony
*NL*
upon
the
pink
dress
and
went
out
of
the
box
.
In
the
corridor
he
found
*NL*
Valentin
and
his
companion
walking
towards
him
.
The
latter
was
thrusting
*NL*
a
card
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
Mademoiselle
Noemie
's
jealous
votary
*NL*
was
a
tall
,
robust
young
man
with
a
thick
nose
,
a
prominent
blue
eye
,
a
*NL*
Germanic
physiognomy
,
and
a
massive
watch-chain
.
When
they
reached
the
*NL*
box
,
Valentin
with
an
emphasized
bow
made
way
for
him
to
pass
in
first
.
*NL*
Newman
touched
Valentin
's
arm
as
a
sign
that
he
wished
to
speak
with
*NL*
him
,
and
Bellegarde
answered
that
he
would
be
with
him
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
Valentin
entered
the
box
after
the
robust
young
man
,
but
a
couple
of
*NL*
minutes
afterwards
he
reappeared
,
largely
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
immensely
tickled
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
says
we
will
make
her
fortune
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
be
fatuous
,
but
I
think
it
is
very
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
going
to
fight
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
do
n't
look
so
mortally
disgusted
.
It
was
not
my
choice
.
*NL*
The
thing
is
all
arranged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
groaned
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
HIM
so
,
''
said
Valentin
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
do
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
friend
,
it
does
n't
matter
what
.
He
used
an
expression
--
I
took
*NL*
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
insist
upon
knowing
;
I
ca
n't
,
as
your
elder
brother
,
have
you
*NL*
rushing
into
this
sort
of
nonsense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
I
have
nothing
to
*NL*
conceal
,
but
I
ca
n't
go
into
particulars
now
and
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
leave
this
place
,
then
.
You
can
tell
me
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
ca
n't
leave
this
place
,
why
should
I
hurry
away
?
I
will
go
to
*NL*
my
orchestra-stall
and
sit
out
the
opera
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
enjoy
it
;
you
will
be
preoccupied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
colored
a
little
,
smiled
,
and
patted
*NL*
him
on
the
arm
.
``
You
are
delightfully
simple
!
Before
an
affair
a
man
is
*NL*
quiet
.
The
quietest
thing
I
can
do
is
to
go
straight
to
my
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
you
want
her
to
see
you
there
--
you
and
your
*NL*
quietness
.
I
am
not
so
simple
!
It
is
a
poor
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
remained
,
and
the
two
men
,
in
their
respective
places
,
sat
*NL*
out
the
rest
of
the
performance
,
which
was
also
enjoyed
by
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
and
her
truculent
admirer
.
At
the
end
Newman
joined
Valentin
*NL*
again
,
and
they
went
into
the
street
together
.
Valentin
shook
his
head
*NL*
at
his
friend
's
proposal
that
he
should
get
into
Newman
's
own
vehicle
,
*NL*
and
stopped
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
.
``
I
must
go
off
alone
,
''
he
*NL*
said
;
``
I
must
look
up
a
couple
of
friends
who
will
take
charge
of
this
*NL*
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
charge
of
it
,
''
Newman
declared
.
``
Put
it
into
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
but
that
is
hardly
possible
.
In
the
first
place
,
you
*NL*
are
,
as
you
said
just
now
,
almost
my
brother
;
you
are
about
to
marry
*NL*
my
sister
.
That
alone
disqualifies
you
;
it
casts
doubts
on
your
*NL*
impartiality
.
And
if
it
did
n't
,
it
would
be
enough
for
me
that
I
*NL*
strongly
suspect
you
of
disapproving
of
the
affair
.
You
would
try
to
*NL*
prevent
a
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
should
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Whoever
your
friends
are
,
I
hope
*NL*
they
will
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unquestionably
they
will
.
They
will
urge
that
excuses
be
made
,
proper
*NL*
excuses
.
But
you
would
be
too
good-natured
.
You
wo
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
moment
.
He
was
keenly
annoyed
,
but
he
saw
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
attempt
interference
.
``
When
is
this
precious
performance
to
*NL*
come
off
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sooner
the
better
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
The
day
after
to-morrow
,
I
*NL*
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
have
certainly
a
claim
to
know
the
facts
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
consent
to
shut
my
eyes
to
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
tell
you
the
facts
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
They
are
*NL*
very
simple
,
and
it
will
be
quickly
done
.
But
now
everything
depends
on
*NL*
my
putting
my
hands
on
my
friends
without
delay
.
I
will
jump
into
a
cab
;
*NL*
you
had
better
drive
to
my
room
and
wait
for
me
there
.
I
will
turn
up
at
*NL*
the
end
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
assented
protestingly
,
let
his
friend
go
,
and
then
betook
himself
*NL*
to
the
picturesque
little
apartment
in
the
Rue
d'Anjou
.
It
was
more
*NL*
than
an
hour
before
Valentin
returned
,
but
when
he
did
so
he
was
able
*NL*
to
announce
that
he
had
found
one
of
his
desired
friends
,
and
that
this
*NL*
gentleman
had
taken
upon
himself
the
care
of
securing
an
associate
.
*NL*
Newman
had
been
sitting
without
lights
by
Valentin
's
faded
fire
,
upon
*NL*
which
he
had
thrown
a
log
;
the
blaze
played
over
the
richly-encumbered
*NL*
little
sitting-room
and
produced
fantastic
gleams
and
shadows
.
He
*NL*
listened
in
silence
to
Valentin
's
account
of
what
had
passed
between
him
*NL*
and
the
gentleman
whose
card
he
had
in
his
pocket
--
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
,
*NL*
of
Strasbourg
--
after
his
return
to
Mademoiselle
Nioche
's
box
.
This
*NL*
hospitable
young
lady
had
espied
an
acquaintance
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
had
expressed
her
displeasure
at
his
not
having
the
*NL*
civility
to
come
and
pay
her
a
visit
.
``
Oh
,
let
him
alone
!
''
M.
Stanislas
*NL*
Kapp
had
hereupon
exclaimed
.
``
There
are
too
many
people
in
the
box
*NL*
already
.
''
And
he
had
fixed
his
eyes
with
a
demonstrative
stare
upon
M.
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
.
Valentin
had
promptly
retorted
that
if
there
were
too
*NL*
many
people
in
the
box
it
was
easy
for
M.
Kapp
to
diminish
the
number
.
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
open
the
door
for
YOU
!
''
M.
Kapp
exclaimed
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
be
delighted
to
fling
you
into
the
pit
!
''
Valentin
had
answered
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
make
a
rumpus
and
get
into
the
papers
!
''
Miss
Noemie
had
*NL*
gleefully
ejaculated
.
``
M.
Kapp
,
turn
him
out
;
or
,
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
*NL*
pitch
him
into
the
pit
,
into
the
orchestra
--
anywhere
!
I
do
n't
care
who
*NL*
does
which
,
so
long
as
you
make
a
scene
.
''
Valentin
answered
that
they
*NL*
would
make
no
scene
,
but
that
the
gentleman
would
be
so
good
as
to
*NL*
step
into
the
corridor
with
him
.
In
the
corridor
,
after
a
brief
further
*NL*
exchange
of
words
,
there
had
been
an
exchange
of
cards
.
M.
Stanislas
*NL*
Kapp
was
very
stiff
.
He
evidently
meant
to
force
his
offence
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
,
no
doubt
,
was
insolent
,
''
Newman
said
;
``
but
if
you
had
n't
gone
*NL*
back
into
the
box
the
thing
would
n't
have
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
see
,
''
Valentin
replied
,
``
that
the
event
proves
the
*NL*
extreme
propriety
of
my
going
back
into
the
box
?
M.
Kapp
wished
to
*NL*
provoke
me
;
he
was
awaiting
his
chance
.
In
such
a
case
--
that
is
,
when
*NL*
he
has
been
,
so
to
speak
,
notified
--
a
man
must
be
on
hand
to
receive
the
*NL*
provocation
.
My
not
returning
would
simply
have
been
tantamount
to
*NL*
my
saying
to
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
,
`
Oh
,
if
you
are
going
to
be
*NL*
disagreeable
'
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
must
manage
it
by
yourself
;
damned
if
I
'll
help
you
!
'
That
would
*NL*
have
been
a
thoroughly
sensible
thing
to
say
.
The
only
attraction
for
*NL*
you
seems
to
have
been
the
prospect
of
M.
Kapp
's
impertinence
,
''
Newman
*NL*
went
on
.
``
You
told
me
you
were
not
going
back
for
that
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
mention
that
girl
any
more
,
''
murmured
Valentin
.
``
She
's
a
*NL*
bore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart
.
But
if
that
is
the
way
you
feel
about
her
,
why
*NL*
could
n't
you
let
her
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
shook
his
head
with
a
fine
smile
.
``
I
do
n't
think
you
quite
*NL*
understand
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
I
can
make
you
.
She
understood
the
*NL*
situation
;
she
knew
what
was
in
the
air
;
she
was
watching
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cat
may
look
at
a
king
!
What
difference
does
that
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
a
man
ca
n't
back
down
before
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
her
a
woman
.
You
said
yourself
she
was
a
stone
,
''
cried
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
Valentin
rejoined
,
``
there
is
no
disputing
about
tastes
.
It
's
a
*NL*
matter
of
feeling
;
it
's
measured
by
one
's
sense
of
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
confound
your
sense
of
honor
!
''
cried
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
vain
talking
,
''
said
Valentin
;
``
words
have
passed
,
and
the
thing
*NL*
is
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
turned
away
,
taking
his
hat
.
Then
pausing
with
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
door
,
``
What
are
you
going
to
use
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
for
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
,
as
the
challenged
party
,
to
decide
.
*NL*
My
own
choice
would
be
a
short
,
light
sword
.
I
handle
it
well
.
I
'm
an
*NL*
indifferent
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
put
on
his
hat
;
he
pushed
it
back
,
gently
scratching
his
*NL*
forehead
,
high
up
.
``
I
wish
it
were
pistols
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
could
show
you
*NL*
how
to
lodge
a
bullet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
broke
into
a
laugh
.
``
What
is
it
some
English
poet
says
about
*NL*
consistency
?
It
's
a
flower
or
a
star
,
or
a
jewel
.
Yours
has
the
beauty
*NL*
of
all
three
!
''
But
he
agreed
to
see
Newman
again
on
the
morrow
,
after
*NL*
the
details
of
his
meeting
with
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
should
have
been
*NL*
arranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
the
day
Newman
received
three
lines
from
him
,
saying
*NL*
that
it
had
been
decided
that
he
should
cross
the
frontier
,
with
his
*NL*
adversary
,
and
that
he
was
to
take
the
night
express
to
Geneva
.
He
*NL*
should
have
time
,
however
,
to
dine
with
Newman
.
In
the
afternoon
Newman
*NL*
called
upon
Madame
de
Cintre
,
but
his
visit
was
brief
.
She
was
as
*NL*
gracious
and
sympathetic
as
he
had
ever
found
her
,
but
she
was
sad
,
and
*NL*
she
confessed
,
on
Newman
's
charging
her
with
her
red
eyes
,
that
she
had
*NL*
been
crying
.
Valentin
had
been
with
her
a
couple
of
hours
before
,
and
*NL*
his
visit
had
left
her
with
a
painful
impression
.
He
had
laughed
and
*NL*
gossiped
,
he
had
brought
her
no
bad
news
,
he
had
only
been
,
in
his
*NL*
manner
,
rather
more
affectionate
than
usual
.
His
fraternal
tenderness
*NL*
had
touched
her
,
and
on
his
departure
she
had
burst
into
tears
.
She
had
*NL*
felt
as
if
something
strange
and
sad
were
going
to
happen
;
she
had
tried
*NL*
to
reason
away
the
fancy
,
and
the
effort
had
only
given
her
a
headache
.
*NL*
Newman
,
of
course
,
was
perforce
tongue-tied
about
Valentin
's
projected
*NL*
duel
,
and
his
dramatic
talent
was
not
equal
to
satirizing
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
's
presentiment
as
pointedly
as
perfect
security
demanded
.
Before
*NL*
he
went
away
he
asked
Madame
de
Cintre
whether
Valentin
had
seen
his
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
he
did
n't
make
her
cry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
Newman
's
own
apartment
that
Valentin
dined
,
having
brought
*NL*
his
portmanteau
,
so
that
he
might
adjourn
directly
to
the
railway
.
M.
*NL*
Stanislas
Kapp
had
positively
declined
to
make
excuses
,
and
he
,
on
his
*NL*
side
,
obviously
,
had
none
to
offer
.
Valentin
had
found
out
with
whom
he
*NL*
was
dealing
.
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
was
the
son
of
and
heir
of
a
rich
brewer
*NL*
of
Strasbourg
,
a
youth
of
a
sanguineous
--
and
sanguinary
--
temperament
.
*NL*
He
was
making
ducks
and
drakes
of
the
paternal
brewery
,
and
although
he
*NL*
passed
in
a
general
way
for
a
good
fellow
,
he
had
already
been
observed
*NL*
to
be
quarrelsome
after
dinner
.
``
Que
voulez-vous
?
''
said
Valentin
.
*NL*
``
Brought
up
on
beer
,
he
ca
n't
stand
champagne
.
''
He
had
chosen
pistols
.
*NL*
Valentin
,
at
dinner
,
had
an
excellent
appetite
;
he
made
a
point
,
in
view
*NL*
of
his
long
journey
,
of
eating
more
than
usual
.
He
took
the
liberty
*NL*
of
suggesting
to
Newman
a
slight
modification
in
the
composition
of
a
*NL*
certain
fish-sauce
;
he
thought
it
would
be
worth
mentioning
to
the
*NL*
cook
.
But
Newman
had
no
thoughts
for
fish-sauce
;
he
felt
thoroughly
*NL*
discontented
.
As
he
sat
and
watched
his
amiable
and
clever
companion
*NL*
going
through
his
excellent
repast
with
the
delicate
deliberation
of
*NL*
hereditary
epicurism
,
the
folly
of
so
charming
a
fellow
traveling
off
*NL*
to
expose
his
agreeable
young
life
for
the
sake
of
M.
Stanislas
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Noemie
struck
him
with
intolerable
force
.
He
had
grown
fond
*NL*
of
Valentin
,
he
felt
now
how
fond
;
and
his
sense
of
helplessness
only
*NL*
increased
his
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
sort
of
thing
may
be
all
very
well
,
''
he
cried
at
last
,
``
but
*NL*
I
declare
I
do
n't
see
it
.
I
ca
n't
stop
you
,
perhaps
,
but
at
least
I
can
*NL*
protest
.
I
do
protest
,
violently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
do
n't
make
a
scene
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
Scenes
in
these
*NL*
cases
are
in
very
bad
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
duel
itself
is
a
scene
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
that
's
all
it
is
!
It
's
a
*NL*
wretched
theatrical
affair
.
Why
do
n't
you
take
a
band
of
music
with
you
*NL*
outright
?
It
's
d
--
d
barbarous
and
it
's
d
--
d
corrupt
,
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
begin
,
at
this
time
of
day
,
to
defend
the
theory
of
*NL*
dueling
,
''
said
Valentin
.
``
It
is
our
custom
,
and
I
think
it
is
a
good
*NL*
thing
.
Quite
apart
from
the
goodness
of
the
cause
in
which
a
duel
may
*NL*
be
fought
,
it
has
a
kind
of
picturesque
charm
which
in
this
age
of
*NL*
vile
prose
seems
to
me
greatly
to
recommend
it
.
It
's
a
remnant
of
a
*NL*
higher-tempered
time
;
one
ought
to
cling
to
it
.
Depend
upon
it
,
a
duel
*NL*
is
never
amiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
a
higher-tempered
time
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
Because
your
great-grandfather
was
an
ass
,
is
that
any
reason
why
you
*NL*
should
be
?
For
my
part
I
think
we
had
better
let
our
temper
take
care
of
*NL*
itself
;
it
generally
seems
to
me
quite
high
enough
;
I
am
not
afraid
*NL*
of
being
too
meek
.
If
your
great-grandfather
were
to
make
himself
*NL*
unpleasant
to
me
,
I
think
I
could
manage
him
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
friend
,
''
said
Valentin
,
smiling
,
``
you
ca
n't
invent
anything
*NL*
that
will
take
the
place
of
satisfaction
for
an
insult
.
To
demand
it
and
*NL*
to
give
it
are
equally
excellent
arrangements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
this
sort
of
thing
satisfaction
?
''
Newman
asked
.
``
Does
it
*NL*
satisfy
you
to
receive
a
present
of
the
carcass
of
that
coarse
fop
?
does
*NL*
it
gratify
you
to
make
him
a
present
of
yours
?
If
a
man
hits
you
,
hit
*NL*
him
back
;
if
a
man
libels
you
,
haul
him
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Haul
him
up

into
court
?
Oh

that
is
very
nasty
!

said
Valentin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nastiness
is
his

not
yours

And
for
that
matter

what
you
are

doing
is
not
particularly
nice

You
are
too
good
for
it

I
do

you
are
the
most
useful
man
in
the
world

the
cleverest

*NL*
most
amiable

you
are

good

go
and
get
your
throat
cut
for
a
*NL*
prostitute

*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
flushed
a
little
,
but
he
laughed
.
``
I
sha
n't
get
my
throat
cut
*NL*
if
I
can
help
it

Moreover
,
one
's
honor
has
n't
two
different
measures

*NL*
It
only
knows
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
fool

is

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
ceased
to
laugh
;
he
looked
grave
.
``
I
beg
you
not
to
say
*NL*
any
more

he
said
.
``
If
you
do
I
shall
almost
fancy
you
do

care

about

about

he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About

*NL*
*NL*
``
About

Newman

come
back
without

damage

he
added
in
a
moment
,
``
and
I
will
forgive
you

And
then
,

*NL*
he
continued
,
as
Valentin
was
going
,
``
I
will
ship
you
straight
off
to

America

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

answered
Valentin
,
``
if
I
am
to
turn
over
a
new
page
,
this
may
*NL*
figure
as
a
tail-piece
to

And
then
he
lit
another
cigar
and
*NL*
departed
.

*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
went
the
next
morning
to
see
Madame
de
Cintre
,
timing
his
visit
*NL*
so
as
to
arrive
after
the
noonday
breakfast
.
In
the
court
of
the
hotel
,
*NL*
before
the
portico
,
stood
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
old
square
carriage
.
*NL*
The
servant
who
opened
the
door
answered
Newman
's
inquiry
with
a
*NL*
slightly
embarrassed
and
hesitating
murmur
,
and
at
the
same
moment
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
appeared
in
the
background
,
dim-visaged
as
usual
,
and
wearing
a
*NL*
large
black
bonnet
and
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
Newman
.
``
Is
Madame
la
Comtesse
at
home
,
or
*NL*
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
advanced
,
fixing
her
eyes
upon
him
:
he
observed
that
she
held
*NL*
a
sealed
letter
,
very
delicately
,
in
her
fingers
.
``
The
countess
has
left
*NL*
a
message
for
you
,
sir
;
she
has
left
this
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
holding
out
*NL*
the
letter
,
which
Newman
took
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
it
?
Is
she
out
?
Is
she
gone
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
going
away
,
sir
;
she
is
leaving
town
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leaving
town
!
''
exclaimed
Newman
.
``
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
me
to
say
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
``
But
I
thought
it
would
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
come
,
pray
?
''
Newman
demanded
.
He
had
broken
the
seal
of
the
*NL*
letter
,
but
he
still
questioned
.
``
She
is
in
the
house
?
She
is
visible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
she
expected
you
this
morning
,
''
the
old
waiting-woman
*NL*
replied
.
``
She
was
to
leave
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Fleurieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Fleurieres
?
But
surely
I
can
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
clasping
together
her
two
hands
,
*NL*
``
I
will
take
you
!
''
she
said
.
And
she
led
the
way
upstairs
.
At
the
top
*NL*
of
the
staircase
she
paused
and
fixed
her
dry
,
sad
eyes
upon
Newman
.
``
Be
*NL*
very
easy
with
her
,
''
she
said
;
``
she
is
most
unhappy
!
''
Then
she
went
on
*NL*
to
Madame
de
Cintre
's
apartment
;
Newman
,
perplexed
and
alarmed
,
followed
*NL*
her
rapidly
.
Mrs.
Bread
threw
open
the
door
,
and
Newman
pushed
back
the
*NL*
curtain
at
the
farther
side
of
its
deep
embrasure
.
In
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
stood
Madame
de
Cintre
;
her
face
was
pale
and
she
was
dressed
*NL*
for
traveling
.
Behind
her
,
before
the
fire-place
,
stood
Urbain
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
looking
at
his
finger-nails
;
near
the
marquis
sat
his
*NL*
mother
,
buried
in
an
arm-chair
,
and
with
her
eyes
immediately
fixing
*NL*
themselves
upon
Newman
.
He
felt
,
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
,
that
he
*NL*
was
in
the
presence
of
something
evil
;
he
was
startled
and
pained
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
been
by
a
threatening
cry
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
.
He
*NL*
walked
straight
to
Madame
de
Cintre
and
seized
her
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
asked
,
commandingly
;
``
what
is
happening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
stared
,
then
left
his
place
and
came
and
leaned
*NL*
upon
his
mother
's
chair
,
behind
.
Newman
's
sudden
irruption
had
evidently
*NL*
discomposed
both
mother
and
son
.
Madame
de
Cintre
stood
silent
,
with
*NL*
her
eyes
resting
upon
Newman
's
.
She
had
often
looked
at
him
with
all
her
*NL*
soul
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
;
but
in
this
present
gaze
there
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
bottomless
depth
.
She
was
in
distress
;
it
was
the
most
touching
thing
he
*NL*
had
ever
seen
.
His
heart
rose
into
his
throat
,
and
he
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
turning
to
her
companions
,
with
an
angry
challenge
;
but
she
checked
*NL*
him
,
pressing
the
hand
that
held
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
very
grave
has
happened
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
can
not
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
dropped
her
hand
and
stood
staring
,
first
at
her
and
then
at
the
*NL*
others
.
``
Why
not
?
''
he
asked
,
as
quietly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
almost
smiled
,
but
the
attempt
was
strange
.
``
You
must
*NL*
ask
my
mother
,
you
must
ask
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
she
marry
me
?
''
said
Newman
,
looking
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
did
not
move
in
her
place
,
but
she
was
as
pale
as
*NL*
her
daughter
.
The
marquis
looked
down
at
her
.
She
said
nothing
for
some
*NL*
moments
,
but
she
kept
her
keen
,
clear
eyes
upon
Newman
,
bravely
.
The
*NL*
marquis
drew
himself
up
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
.
``
It
's
impossible
!
''
he
*NL*
said
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
improper
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
began
to
laugh
.
``
Oh
,
you
are
fooling
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
,
you
have
no
time
;
you
are
losing
your
train
,
''
said
the
*NL*
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
is
he
mad
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
do
n't
think
that
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
But
I
am
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
country
,
to
Fleurieres
;
to
be
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
leave
me
?
''
said
Newman
,
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
you
,
now
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
NOW
--
why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
turned
toward
the
marquis
.
``
What
have
you
done
to
her
--
what
does
*NL*
it
mean
?
''
he
asked
with
the
same
effort
at
calmness
,
the
fruit
of
*NL*
his
constant
practice
in
taking
things
easily
.
He
was
excited
,
but
*NL*
excitement
with
him
was
only
an
intenser
deliberateness
;
it
was
the
*NL*
swimmer
stripped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
I
have
given
you
up
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
It
means
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
was
too
charged
with
tragic
expression
not
fully
to
confirm
her
*NL*
words
.
Newman
was
profoundly
shocked
,
but
he
felt
as
yet
no
resentment
*NL*
against
her
.
He
was
amazed
,
bewildered
,
and
the
presence
of
the
old
*NL*
marquise
and
her
son
seemed
to
smite
his
eyes
like
the
glare
of
a
*NL*
watchman
's
lantern
.
``
Ca
n't
I
see
you
alone
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
only
more
painful
.
I
hoped
I
should
not
see
you
--
I
should
*NL*
escape
.
I
wrote
to
you
.
Good-by
.
''
And
she
put
out
her
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
put
both
his
own
into
his
pockets
.
``
I
will
go
with
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
arm
.
``
Will
you
grant
me
a
last
request
?
''
*NL*
and
as
she
looked
at
him
,
urging
this
,
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
``
Let
*NL*
me
go
alone
--
let
me
go
in
peace
.
I
ca
n't
call
it
peace
--
it
's
death
.
But
*NL*
let
me
bury
myself
.
So
--
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
passed
his
hand
into
his
hair
and
stood
slowly
rubbing
his
head
*NL*
and
looking
through
his
keenly-narrowed
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
of
*NL*
the
three
persons
before
him
.
His
lips
were
compressed
,
and
the
two
*NL*
lines
which
had
formed
themselves
beside
his
mouth
might
have
made
*NL*
it
appear
at
a
first
glance
that
he
was
smiling
.
I
have
said
that
his
*NL*
excitement
was
an
intenser
deliberateness
,
and
now
he
looked
grimly
*NL*
deliberate
.
``
It
seems
very
much
as
if
you
had
interfered
,
marquis
,
''
*NL*
he
said
slowly
.
``
I
thought
you
said
you
would
n't
interfere
.
I
know
*NL*
you
do
n't
like
me
;
but
that
does
n't
make
any
difference
.
I
thought
you
*NL*
promised
me
you
would
n't
interfere
.
I
thought
you
swore
on
your
honor
*NL*
that
you
would
n't
interfere
.
Do
n't
you
remember
,
marquis
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
lifted
his
eyebrows
;
but
he
was
apparently
determined
to
be
*NL*
even
more
urbane
than
usual
.
He
rested
his
two
hands
upon
the
back
of
*NL*
his
mother
's
chair
and
bent
forward
,
as
if
he
were
leaning
over
the
edge
*NL*
of
a
pulpit
or
a
lecture-desk
.
He
did
not
smile
,
but
he
looked
softly
*NL*
grave
.
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
assured
you
that
I
would
not
*NL*
influence
my
sister
's
decision
.
I
adhered
,
to
the
letter
,
to
my
*NL*
engagement
.
Did
I
not
,
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
appeal
,
my
son
,
''
said
the
marquise
,
``
your
word
is
sufficient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
she
accepted
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
That
is
very
true
,
I
ca
n't
deny
*NL*
that
.
At
least
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
different
tone
,
turning
to
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
,
``
you
DID
accept
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
tone
seemed
to
move
her
strongly
.
She
turned
away
,
*NL*
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
interfered
now
,
have
n't
you
?
''
inquired
Newman
of
the
*NL*
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
then
nor
now
have
I
attempted
to
influence
my
sister
.
I
used
no
*NL*
persuasion
then
,
I
have
used
no
persuasion
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
you
used
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
used
authority
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
in
a
rich
,
bell-like
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
used
authority
,
''
Newman
exclaimed
.
``
They
have
used
*NL*
authority
,
''
he
went
on
,
turning
to
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
What
is
it
?
how
*NL*
did
they
use
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
commanded
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Commanded
you
to
give
me
up
--
I
see
.
And
you
obey
--
I
see
.
But
why
do
you
*NL*
obey
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
across
at
the
old
marquise
;
her
eyes
slowly
*NL*
measured
her
from
head
to
foot
.
``
I
am
afraid
of
my
mother
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
rose
with
a
certain
quickness
,
crying
,
``
This
is
a
*NL*
most
indecent
scene
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
wish
to
prolong
it
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
;
and
turning
to
*NL*
the
door
she
put
out
her
hand
again
.
``
If
you
can
pity
me
a
little
,
let
*NL*
me
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
shook
her
hand
quietly
and
firmly
.
``
I
'll
come
down
there
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
The
portiere
dropped
behind
her
,
and
Newman
sank
with
a
long
*NL*
breath
into
the
nearest
chair
.
He
leaned
back
in
it
,
resting
his
hands
*NL*
on
the
knobs
of
the
arms
and
looking
at
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
Urbain
.
*NL*
There
was
a
long
silence
.
They
stood
side
by
side
,
with
their
heads
high
*NL*
and
their
handsome
eyebrows
arched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
make
a
distinction
?
''
Newman
said
at
last
.
``
You
make
a
*NL*
distinction
between
persuading
and
commanding
?
It
's
very
neat
.
But
the
*NL*
distinction
is
in
favor
of
commanding
.
That
rather
spoils
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
not
the
least
objection
to
defining
our
position
,
''
said
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
``
We
understand
that
it
should
not
at
first
appear
to
you
*NL*
quite
clear
.
We
rather
expected
,
indeed
,
that
you
should
not
do
us
*NL*
justice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
do
you
justice
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
Please
*NL*
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
laid
her
hand
on
her
son
's
arm
,
as
if
to
deprecate
the
*NL*
attempt
to
define
their
position
.
``
It
is
quite
useless
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
*NL*
try
and
arrange
this
matter
so
as
to
make
it
agreeable
to
you
.
It
can
*NL*
never
be
agreeable
to
you
.
It
is
a
disappointment
,
and
disappointments
*NL*
are
unpleasant
.
I
thought
it
over
carefully
and
tried
to
arrange
it
*NL*
better
;
but
I
only
gave
myself
a
headache
and
lost
my
sleep
.
Say
what
*NL*
we
will
,
you
will
think
yourself
ill-treated
,
and
you
will
publish
your
*NL*
wrongs
among
your
friends
.
But
we
are
not
afraid
of
that
.
Besides
,
your
*NL*
friends
are
not
our
friends
,
and
it
will
not
matter
.
Think
of
us
as
you
*NL*
please
.
I
only
beg
you
not
to
be
violent
.
I
have
never
in
my
life
*NL*
been
present
at
a
violent
scene
of
any
kind
,
and
at
my
age
I
ca
n't
be
*NL*
expected
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
THAT
all
you
have
got
to
say
?
''
asked
Newman
,
slowly
rising
out
of
*NL*
his
chair
.
``
That
's
a
poor
show
for
a
clever
lady
like
you
,
marquise
.
*NL*
Come
,
try
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
goes
to
the
point
,
with
her
usual
honesty
and
intrepidity
,
''
*NL*
said
the
marquis
,
toying
with
his
watch-guard
.
``
But
it
is
perhaps
well
*NL*
to
say
a
little
more
.
We
of
course
quite
repudiate
the
charge
of
having
*NL*
broken
faith
with
you
.
We
left
you
entirely
at
liberty
to
make
yourself
*NL*
agreeable
to
my
sister
.
We
left
her
quite
at
liberty
to
entertain
your
*NL*
proposal
.
When
she
accepted
you
we
said
nothing
.
We
therefore
quite
*NL*
observed
our
promise
.
It
was
only
at
a
later
stage
of
the
affair
,
and
*NL*
on
quite
a
different
basis
,
as
it
were
,
that
we
determined
to
speak
.
It
*NL*
would
have
been
better
,
perhaps
,
if
we
had
spoken
before
.
But
really
,
*NL*
you
see
,
nothing
has
yet
been
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
has
yet
been
done
?
''
Newman
repeated
the
words
,
unconscious
*NL*
of
their
comical
effect
.
He
had
lost
the
sense
of
what
the
marquis
was
*NL*
saying
;
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
superior
style
was
a
mere
humming
in
his
*NL*
ears
.
All
that
he
understood
,
in
his
deep
and
simple
indignation
,
was
*NL*
that
the
matter
was
not
a
violent
joke
,
and
that
the
people
before
him
*NL*
were
perfectly
serious
.
``
Do
you
suppose
I
can
take
this
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
it
can
matter
to
me
what
you
say
?
Do
you
suppose
I
can
*NL*
seriously
listen
to
you
?
You
are
simply
crazy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
gave
a
rap
with
her
fan
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
.
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
take
it
you
can
leave
it

sir

It
matters
very
little
what

you
do

My
daughter
has
given
you
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
mean
it

Newman
declared
after
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
can
assure
you
that
she
does

said
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman

what
damnable
thing
have
you
done

cried
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gently

gently

murmured
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
told
you

said
the
old
lady

Newman
shook
his
head

heavily

*NL*
he
said
.
``
A
man
ca
n't
be
used
in
this
fashion

You
have
got
no
right
;
*NL*
you
have
got
no
power

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
power
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
is
in
my
children
's
obedience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
their
fear
,
your
daughter
said
.
There
is
something
very
strange
*NL*
in
it
.
Why
should
your
daughter
be
afraid
of
you
?
''
added
Newman
,
after
*NL*
looking
a
moment
at
the
old
lady
.
``
There
is
some
foul
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
met
his
gaze
without
flinching
,
and
as
if
she
did
not
*NL*
hear
or
heed
what
he
said
.
``
I
did
my
best
,
''
she
said
,
quietly
.
``
I
could
*NL*
endure
it
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
bold
experiment
!
''
said
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
felt
disposed
to
walk
to
him
,
clutch
his
neck
with
his
fingers
*NL*
and
press
his
windpipe
with
his
thumb
.
``
I
need
n't
tell
you
how
you
*NL*
strike
me
,
''
he
said
;
``
of
course
you
know
that
.
But
I
should
think
you
*NL*
would
be
afraid
of
your
friends
--
all
those
people
you
introduced
me
to
*NL*
the
other
night
.
There
were
some
very
nice
people
among
them
;
you
may
*NL*
depend
upon
it
there
were
some
honest
men
and
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
friends
approve
us
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
there
is
not
a
family
*NL*
among
them
that
would
have
acted
otherwise
.
And
however
that
may
be
,
*NL*
we
take
the
cue
from
no
one
.
The
Bellegardes
have
been
used
to
set
the
*NL*
example
not
to
wait
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
waited
long
before
any
one
would
have
set
you
such
an
*NL*
example
as
this
,
''
exclaimed
Newman
.
``
Have
I
done
anything
wrong
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
.
``
Have
I
given
you
reason
to
change
your
opinion
?
Have
you
*NL*
found
out
anything
against
me
?
I
ca
n't
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
opinion
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
``
is
quite
the
same
as
at
*NL*
first
--
exactly
.
We
have
no
ill-will
towards
yourself
;
we
are
very
far
*NL*
from
accusing
you
of
misconduct
.
Since
your
relations
with
us
began
you
*NL*
have
been
,
I
frankly
confess
,
less
--
less
peculiar
than
I
expected
.
It
*NL*
is
not
your
disposition
that
we
object
to
,
it
is
your
antecedents
.
We
*NL*
really
can
not
reconcile
ourselves
to
a
commercial
person
.
We
fancied
in
*NL*
an
evil
hour
that
we
could
;
it
was
a
great
misfortune
.
We
determined
to
*NL*
persevere
to
the
end
,
and
to
give
you
every
advantage
.
I
was
resolved
*NL*
that
you
should
have
no
reason
to
accuse
me
of
want
of
loyalty
.
We
let
*NL*
the
thing
certainly
go
very
far
;
we
introduced
you
to
our
friends
.
To
*NL*
tell
the
truth
,
it
was
that
,
I
think
,
that
broke
me
down
.
I
succumbed
*NL*
to
the
scene
that
took
place
on
Thursday
night
in
these
rooms
.
You
must
*NL*
excuse
me
if
what
I
say
is
disagreeable
to
you
,
but
we
can
not
release
*NL*
ourselves
without
an
explanation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
better
proof
of
our
good
faith
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
*NL*
``
than
our
committing
ourselves
to
you
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
other
*NL*
evening
.
We
endeavored
to
bind
ourselves
--
to
tie
our
hands
,
as
it
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
that
,
''
added
his
mother
,
``
that
opened
our
eyes
and
broke
our
*NL*
bonds
.
We
should
have
been
most
uncomfortable
!
You
know
,
''
she
added
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
``
that
you
were
forewarned
.
I
told
you
we
were
very
proud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
took
up
his
hat
and
began
mechanically
to
smooth
it
;
the
very
*NL*
fierceness
of
his
scorn
kept
him
from
speaking
.
``
You
are
not
proud
*NL*
enough
,
''
he
observed
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
all
this
matter
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
smiling
,
``
I
really
see
nothing
*NL*
but
our
humility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
have
no
more
discussion
than
is
necessary
,
''
resumed
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
.
``
My
daughter
told
you
everything
when
she
said
she
gave
you
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
satisfied
about
your
daughter
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
I
want
to
know
*NL*
what
you
did
to
her
.
It
is
all
very
easy
talking
about
authority
and
*NL*
saying
you
commanded
her
.
She
did
n't
accept
me
blindly
,
and
she
would
n't
*NL*
have
given
me
up
blindly
.
Not
that
I
believe
yet
she
has
really
given
me
*NL*
up
;
she
will
talk
it
over
with
me
.
But
you
have
frightened
her
,
you
have
*NL*
bullied
her
,
you
have
HURT
her
.
What
was
it
you
did
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
very
little
!
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
in
a
tone
which
gave
*NL*
Newman
a
chill
when
he
afterwards
remembered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
remind
you
that
we
offered
you
these
explanations
,
''
the
marquis
*NL*
observed
,
``
with
the
express
understanding
that
you
should
abstain
from
*NL*
violence
of
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
violent
,
''
Newman
answered
,
``
it
is
you
who
are
violent
!
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
that
I
have
much
more
to
say
to
you
.
What
you
expect
of
*NL*
me
,
apparently
,
is
to
go
my
way
,
thanking
you
for
favors
received
,
and
*NL*
promising
never
to
trouble
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
expect
of
you
to
act
like
a
clever
man
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
``
You
have
shown
yourself
that
already
,
and
what
we
have
done
is
*NL*
altogether
based
upon
your
being
so
.
When
one
must
submit
,
one
must
.
*NL*
Since
my
daughter
absolutely
withdraws
,
what
will
be
the
use
of
your
*NL*
making
a
noise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
your
daughter
absolutely
withdraws
.
Your
*NL*
daughter
and
I
are
still
very
good
friends
;
nothing
is
changed
in
that
.
*NL*
As
I
say
,
I
will
talk
it
over
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
of
no
use
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
``
I
know
my
daughter
well
*NL*
enough
to
know
that
words
spoken
as
she
just
now
spoke
to
you

final
.
*NL*
Besides
,
she
has
promised
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
her
promise
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
your
own

*NL*
said
Newman
;
``
nevertheless
I
do
n't
give
her
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please

But
if
she

you

and
she
*NL*
wo
n't
,
--
your
constancy
must
remain
purely
Platonic

''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Newman
was
feigning
a
greater
confidence
than
he
felt
.
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
's
strange
intensity
had
in
fact
struck
a
chill
to
his
heart
;
her
*NL*
face
,
still
impressed
upon
his
vision
,
had
been
a
terribly
vivid
image
*NL*
of
renunciation
.
He
felt
sick
,
and
suddenly
helpless
.
He
turned
away
and
*NL*
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
on
the
door
;
then
he
faced
about
and
*NL*
after
the
briefest
hesitation
broke
out
with
a
different
accent
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
think
of
what
this
must
be
to
me
,
and
let
her
alone
!
Why
should
you
*NL*
object
to
me
so
--
what
's
the
matter
with
me
?
I
ca
n't
hurt
you
.
I
would
n't
*NL*
if
I
could
.
I
'm
the
most
unobjectionable
fellow
in
the
world
.
What
if
*NL*
I
am
a
commercial
person
?
What
under
the
sun
do
you
mean
?
A
commercial
*NL*
person
?
I
will
be
any
sort
of
a
person
you
want
.
I
never
talked
to
you
*NL*
about
business
.
Let
her
go
,
and
I
will
ask
no
questions
.
I
will
take
*NL*
her
away
,
and
you
shall
never
see
me
or
hear
of
me
again
.
I
will
stay
in
*NL*
America
if
you
like
.
I
'll
sign
a
paper
promising
never
to
come
back
to
*NL*
Europe
!
All
I
want
is
not
to
lose
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
exchanged
a
glance
of
lucid
irony
,
and
*NL*
Urbain
said
,
``
My
dear
sir
,
what
you
propose
is
hardly
an
improvement
.
We
*NL*
have
not
the
slightest
objection
to
seeing
you
,
as
an
amiable
foreigner
,
*NL*
and
we
have
every
reason
for
not
wishing
to
be
eternally
separated
*NL*
from
my
sister
.
We
object
to
the
marriage
;
and
in
that
way
,
''
and
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
gave
a
small
,
thin
laugh
,
``
she
would
be
more
married
than
*NL*
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
where
is
this
place
of
yours
--
Fleurieres
?
I
*NL*
know
it
is
near
some
old
city
on
a
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
.
Poitiers
is
on
a
hill
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
old
it
is
.
We
are
not
afraid
to
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Poitiers
,
is
it
?
Very
good
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
shall
immediately
*NL*
follow
Madame
de
Cintre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trains
after
this
hour
wo
n't
serve
you
,
''
said
Urbain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
hire
a
special
train
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
a
very
silly
waste
of
money
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
time
enough
to
talk
about
waste
three
days
hence
,
''
Newman
*NL*
answered
;
and
clapping
his
hat
on
his
head
,
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
immediately
start
for
Fleurieres
;
he
was
too
stunned
and
*NL*
wounded
for
consecutive
action
.
He
simply
walked
;
he
walked
straight
*NL*
before
him
,
following
the
river
,
till
he
got
out
of
the
enceinte
of
*NL*
Paris
.
He
had
a
burning
,
tingling
sense
of
personal
outrage
.
He
had
*NL*
never
in
his
life
received
so
absolute
a
check
;
he
had
never
been
pulled
*NL*
up
,
or
,
as
he
would
have
said
,
``
let
down
,
''
so
short
;
and
he
found
the
*NL*
sensation
intolerable
;
he
strode
along
,
tapping
the
trees
and
lamp-posts
*NL*
fiercely
with
his
stick
and
inwardly
raging
.
To
lose
Madame
de
Cintre
*NL*
after
he
had
taken
such
jubilant
and
triumphant
possession
of
her
was
as
*NL*
great
an
affront
to
his
pride
as
it
was
an
injury
to
his
happiness
.
*NL*
And
to
lose
her
by
the
interference
and
the
dictation
of
others
,
by
*NL*
an
impudent
old
woman
and
a
pretentious
fop
stepping
in
with
their
*NL*
``
authority
''
!
It
was
too
preposterous
,
it
was
too
pitiful
.
Upon
what
he
*NL*
deemed
the
unblushing
treachery
of
the
Bellegardes
Newman
wasted
little
*NL*
thought
;
he
consigned
it
,
once
for
all
,
to
eternal
perdition
.
But
the
*NL*
treachery
of
Madame
de
Cintre
herself
amazed
and
confounded
him
;
there
*NL*
was
a
key
to
the
mystery
,
of
course
,
but
he
groped
for
it
in
vain
.
Only
*NL*
three
days
had
elapsed
since
she
stood
beside
him
in
the
starlight
,
*NL*
beautiful
and
tranquil
as
the
trust
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
,
and
*NL*
told
him
that
she
was
happy
in
the
prospect
of
their
marriage
.
What
was
*NL*
the
meaning
of
the
change
?
of
what
infernal
potion
had
she
tasted
?
Poor
*NL*
Newman
had
a
terrible
apprehension
that
she
had
really
changed
.
His
very
*NL*
admiration
for
her
attached
the
idea
of
force
and
weight
to
her
rupture
.
*NL*
But
he
did
not
rail
at
her
as
false
,
for
he
was
sure
she
was
unhappy
.
*NL*
In
his
walk
he
had
crossed
one
of
the
bridges
of
the
Seine
,
and
he
still
*NL*
followed
,
unheedingly
,
the
long
,
unbroken
quay
.
He
had
left
Paris
behind
*NL*
him
,
and
he
was
almost
in
the
country
;
he
was
in
the
pleasant
suburb
of
*NL*
Auteuil
.
He
stopped
at
last
,
looked
around
him
without
seeing
or
caring
*NL*
for
its
pleasantness
,
and
then
slowly
turned
and
at
a
slower
pace
*NL*
retraced
his
steps
.
When
he
came
abreast
of
the
fantastic
embankment
*NL*
known
as
the
Trocadero
,
he
reflected
,
through
his
throbbing
pain
,
*NL*
that
he
was
near
Mrs.
Tristram
's
dwelling
,
and
that
Mrs.
Tristram
,
on
*NL*
particular
occasions
,
had
much
of
a
woman
's
kindness
in
her
utterance
.
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
needed
to
pour
out
his
ire
and
he
took
the
road
to
*NL*
her
house
.
Mrs.
Tristram
was
at
home
and
alone
,
and
as
soon
as
she
had
*NL*
looked
at
him
,
on
his
entering
the
room
,
she
told
him
that
she
knew
what
*NL*
he
had
come
for
.
Newman
sat
down
heavily
,
in
silence
,
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
backed
out
!
''
she
said
.
``
Well
,
you
may
think
it
strange
,
but
*NL*
I
felt
something
the
other
night
in
the
air
.
''
Presently
he
told
her
his
*NL*
story
;
she
listened
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
.
When
he
had
finished
*NL*
she
said
quietly
,
``
They
want
her
to
marry
Lord
Deepmere
.
''
Newman
stared
.
*NL*
He
did
not
know
that
she
knew
anything
about
Lord
Deepmere
.
``
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
she
will
,
''
Mrs.
Tristram
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
SHE
marry
that
poor
little
cub
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
And
yet
,
why
*NL*
did
she
refuse
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
n't
the
only
thing
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
.
``
They
really
*NL*
could
n't
endure
you
any
longer
.
They
had
overrated
their
courage
.
I
must
*NL*
say
,
to
give
the
devil
his
due
,
that
there
is
something
rather
fine
*NL*
in
that
.
It
was
your
commercial
quality
in
the
abstract
they
could
n't
*NL*
swallow
.
That
is
really
aristocratic
.
They
wanted
your
money
,
but
they
*NL*
have
given
you
up
for
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
frowned
most
ruefully
,
and
took
up
his
hat
again
.
``
I
thought
you
*NL*
would
encourage
me
!
''
he
said
,
with
almost
childlike
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
she
answered
very
gently
.
``
I
feel
none
the
less
sorry
*NL*
for
you
,
especially
as
I
am
at
the
bottom
of
your
troubles
.
I
have
not
*NL*
forgotten
that
I
suggested
the
marriage
to
you
.
I
do
n't
believe
that
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
has
any
intention
of
marrying
Lord
Deepmere
.
It
is
true
*NL*
he
is
not
younger
than
she
,
as
he
looks
.
He
is
thirty-three
years
old
;
I
*NL*
looked
in
the
Peerage
.
But
no
--
I
ca
n't
believe
her
so
horribly
,
cruelly
*NL*
false
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
say
nothing
against
her
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman
,
she
IS
cruel
.
But
of
course
you
will
go
after
her
and
you
*NL*
will
plead
powerfully
.
Do
you
know
that
as
you
are
now
,
''
Mrs.
Tristram
*NL*
pursued
,
with
characteristic
audacity
of
comment
,
``
you
are
extremely
*NL*
eloquent
,
even
without
speaking
?
To
resist
you
a
woman
must
have
a
very
*NL*
fixed
idea
in
her
head
.
I
wish
I
had
done
you
a
wrong
,
that
you
might
*NL*
come
to
me
in
that
fine
fashion
!
But
go
to
Madame
de
Cintre
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
and
tell
her
that
she
is
a
puzzle
even
to
me
.
I
am
very
curious
to
see
*NL*
how
far
family
discipline
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
sat
a
while
longer
,
leaning
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
*NL*
head
in
his
hands
,
and
Mrs.
Tristram
continued
to
temper
charity
with
*NL*
philosophy
and
compassion
with
criticism
.
At
last
she
inquired
,
``
And
*NL*
what
does
the
Count
Valentin
say
to
it
?
''
Newman
started
;
he
had
not
*NL*
thought
of
Valentin
and
his
errand
on
the
Swiss
frontier
since
the
*NL*
morning
.
The
reflection
made
him
restless
again
,
and
he
took
his
*NL*
leave
.
He
went
straight
to
his
apartment
,
where
,
upon
the
table
of
the
*NL*
vestibule
,
he
found
a
telegram
.
It
ran
-LRB-
with
the
date
and
place
-RRB-
as
*NL*
follows
:
``
I
am
seriously
ill
;
please
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
.
*NL*
V.
B.
''
Newman
groaned
at
this
miserable
news
,
and
at
the
necessity
of
*NL*
deferring
his
journey
to
the
Chateau
de
Fleurieres
.
But
he
wrote
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
these
few
lines
;
they
were
all
he
had
time
for
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
give
you
up
,
and
I
do
n't
really
believe
you
give
me
up
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
it
,
but
we
shall
clear
it
up
together
.
I
ca
n't
follow
you
*NL*
to-day
,
as
I
am
called
to
see
a
friend
at
a
distance
who
is
very
ill
,
*NL*
perhaps
dying
.
But
I
shall
come
to
you
as
soon
as
I
can
leave
my
friend
.
*NL*
Why
should
n't
I
say
that
he
is
your
brother
?
C.

After
this
he
had
only
time
to
catch
the
night
express
to
Geneva
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
possessed
a
remarkable
talent
for
sitting
still
when
it
was
*NL*
necessary
,
and
he
had
an
opportunity
to
use
it
on
his
journey
to
*NL*
Switzerland
.
The
successive
hours
of
the
night
brought
him
no
sleep
,
but
*NL*
he
sat
motionless
in
his
corner
of
the
railway-carriage
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
closed
,
and
the
most
observant
of
his
fellow-travelers
might
have
envied
*NL*
him
his
apparent
slumber
.
Toward
morning
slumber
really
came
,
as
an
*NL*
effect
of
mental
rather
than
of
physical
fatigue
.
He
slept
for
a
couple
*NL*
of
hours
,
and
at
last
,
waking
,
found
his
eyes
resting
upon
one
of
the
*NL*
snow-powdered
peaks
of
the
Jura
,
behind
which
the
sky
was
just
reddening
*NL*
with
the
dawn
.
But
he
saw
neither
the
cold
mountain
nor
the
warm
sky
;
*NL*
his
consciousness
began
to
throb
again
,
on
the
very
instant
,
with
a
*NL*
sense
of
his
wrong
.
He
got
out
of
the
train
half
an
hour
before
it
*NL*
reached
Geneva
,
in
the
cold
morning
twilight
,
at
the
station
indicated
*NL*
in
Valentin
's
telegram
.
A
drowsy
station-master
was
on
the
platform
*NL*
with
a
lantern
,
and
the
hood
of
his
overcoat
over
his
head
,
and
near
him
*NL*
stood
a
gentleman
who
advanced
to
meet
Newman
.
This
personage
was
a
man
*NL*
of
forty
,
with
a
tall
lean
figure
,
a
sallow
face
,
a
dark
eye
,
a
neat
*NL*
mustache
,
and
a
pair
of
fresh
gloves
.
He
took
off
his
hat
,
looking
very
*NL*
grave
,
and
pronounced
Newman
's
name
.
Our
hero
assented
and
said
,
``
You
*NL*
are
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
unite
with
you
in
claiming
that
sad
honor
,
''
said
the
gentleman
.
*NL*
``
I
had
placed
myself
at
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
service
in
this
melancholy
*NL*
affair
,
together
with
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
,
who
is
now
at
his
bedside
.
M.
de
*NL*
Grosjoyaux
,
I
believe
,
has
had
the
honor
of
meeting
you
in
Paris
,
but
as
*NL*
he
is
a
better
nurse
than
I
he
remained
with
our
poor
friend
.
Bellegarde
*NL*
has
been
eagerly
expecting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
Bellegarde
?
''
said
Newman
.
``
He
was
badly
hit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
has
condemned
him
;
we
brought
a
surgeon
with
us
.
But
he
*NL*
will
die
in
the
best
sentiments
.
I
sent
last
evening
for
the
cure
of
the
*NL*
nearest
French
village
,
who
spent
an
hour
with
him
.
The
cure
was
quite
*NL*
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forgive
us
!
''
groaned
Newman
.
``
I
would
rather
the
doctor
were
*NL*
satisfied
!
And
can
he
see
me
--
shall
he
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
left
him
,
half
an
hour
ago
,
he
had
fallen
asleep
after
a
*NL*
feverish
,
wakeful
night
.
But
we
shall
see
.
''
And
Newman
's
companion
*NL*
proceeded
to
lead
the
way
out
of
the
station
to
the
village
,
explaining
*NL*
as
he
went
that
the
little
party
was
lodged
in
the
humblest
of
Swiss
*NL*
inns
,
where
,
however
,
they
had
succeeded
in
making
M.
de
Bellegarde
much
*NL*
more
comfortable
than
could
at
first
have
been
expected
.
``
We
are
old
*NL*
companions
in
arms
,
''
said
Valentin
's
second
;
``
it
is
not
the
first
time
*NL*
that
one
of
us
has
helped
the
other
to
lie
easily
.
It
is
a
very
nasty
*NL*
wound
,
and
the
nastiest
thing
about
it
is
that
Bellegarde
's
adversary
*NL*
was
not
shot
.
He
put
his
bullet
where
he
could
.
It
took
it
into
its
head
*NL*
to
walk
straight
into
Bellegarde
's
left
side
,
just
below
the
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
picked
their
way
in
the
gray
,
deceptive
dawn
,
between
the
*NL*
manure-heaps
of
the
village
street
,
Newman
's
new
acquaintance
narrated
*NL*
the
particulars
of
the
duel
.
The
conditions
of
the
meeting
had
been
that
*NL*
if
the
first
exchange
of
shots
should
fail
to
satisfy
one
of
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
,
a
second
should
take
place
.
Valentin
's
first
bullet
had
done
*NL*
exactly
what
Newman
's
companion
was
convinced
he
had
intended
it
to
do
;
*NL*
it
had
grazed
the
arm
of
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
,
just
scratching
the
flesh
.
*NL*
M.
Kapp
's
own
projectile
,
meanwhile
,
had
passed
at
ten
good
inches
from
*NL*
the
person
of
Valentin
.
The
representatives
of
M.
Stanislas
had
demanded
*NL*
another
shot
,
which
was
granted
.
Valentin
had
then
fired
aside
and
the
*NL*
young
Alsatian
had
done
effective
execution
.
``
I
saw
,
when
we
met
him
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
''
said
Newman
's
informant
,
``
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
*NL*
commode
.
It
is
a
kind
of
bovine
temperament
.
''
Valentin
had
immediately
*NL*
been
installed
at
the
inn
,
and
M.
Stanislas
and
his
friends
had
*NL*
withdrawn
to
regions
unknown
.
The
police
authorities
of
the
canton
had
*NL*
waited
upon
the
party
at
the
inn
,
had
been
extremely
majestic
,
and
had
*NL*
drawn
up
a
long
proces-verbal
;
but
it
was
probable
that
they
would
*NL*
wink
at
so
very
gentlemanly
a
bit
of
bloodshed
.
Newman
asked
whether
a
*NL*
message
had
not
been
sent
to
Valentin
's
family
,
and
learned
that
up
to
*NL*
a
late
hour
on
the
preceding
evening
Valentin
had
opposed
it
.
He
had
*NL*
refused
to
believe
his
wound
was
dangerous
.
But
after
his
interview
with
*NL*
the
cure
he
had
consented
,
and
a
telegram
had
been
dispatched
to
his
*NL*
mother
.
``
But
the
marquise
had
better
hurry
!
''
said
Newman
's
conductor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
an
abominable
affair
!
''
said
Newman
.
``
That
's
all
I
have
*NL*
to
say
!
''
To
say
this
,
at
least
,
in
a
tone
of
infinite
disgust
was
an
*NL*
irresistible
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
do
n't
approve
?
''
questioned
his
conductor
,
with
curious
*NL*
urbanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Approve
?
''
cried
Newman
.
``
I
wish
that
when
I
had
him
there
,
night
before
*NL*
last
,
I
had
locked
him
up
in
my
cabinet
de
toilette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
's
late
second
opened
his
eyes
,
and
shook
his
head
up
and
down
*NL*
two
or
three
times
,
gravely
,
with
a
little
flute-like
whistle
.
But
they
*NL*
had
reached
the
inn
,
and
a
stout
maid-servant
in
a
night-cap
was
at
the
*NL*
door
with
a
lantern
,
to
take
Newman
's
traveling-bag
from
the
porter
who
*NL*
trudged
behind
him
.
Valentin
was
lodged
on
the
ground-floor
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
Newman
's
companion
went
along
a
stone-faced
passage
*NL*
and
softly
opened
a
door
.
Then
he
beckoned
to
Newman
,
who
advanced
*NL*
and
looked
into
the
room
,
which
was
lighted
by
a
single
shaded
candle
.
*NL*
Beside
the
fire
sat
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
asleep
in
his
dressing-gown
--
a
*NL*
little
plump
,
fair
man
whom
Newman
had
seen
several
times
in
Valentin
's
*NL*
company
.
On
the
bed
lay
Valentin
,
pale
and
still
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
closed
--
a
figure
very
shocking
to
Newman
,
who
had
seen
it
hitherto
awake
*NL*
to
its
finger
tips
.
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
's
colleague
pointed
to
an
open
door
*NL*
beyond
,
and
whispered
that
the
doctor
was
within
,
keeping
guard
.
So
*NL*
long
as
Valentin
slept
,
or
seemed
to
sleep
,
of
course
Newman
could
not
*NL*
approach
him
;
so
our
hero
withdrew
for
the
present
,
committing
*NL*
himself
to
the
care
of
the
half-waked
bonne
.
She
took
him
to
a
room
*NL*
above-stairs
,
and
introduced
him
to
a
bed
on
which
a
magnified
bolster
,
*NL*
in
yellow
calico
,
figured
as
a
counterpane
.
Newman
lay
down
,
and
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
his
counterpane
,
slept
for
three
or
four
hours
.
When
he
awoke
,
*NL*
the
morning
was
advanced
and
the
sun
was
filling
his
window
,
and
he
*NL*
heard
,
outside
of
it
,
the
clucking
of
hens
.
While
he
was
dressing
there
*NL*
came
to
his
door
a
messenger
from
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
and
his
companion
*NL*
proposing
that
he
should
breakfast
with
them
.
Presently
he
went
*NL*
down-stairs
to
the
little
stone-paved
dining-room
,
where
the
*NL*
maid-servant
,
who
had
taken
off
her
night-cap
,
was
serving
the
repast
.
*NL*
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
was
there
,
surprisingly
fresh
for
a
gentleman
who
had
*NL*
been
playing
sick-nurse
half
the
night
,
rubbing
his
hands
and
watching
*NL*
the
breakfast
table
attentively
.
Newman
renewed
acquaintance
with
him
,
*NL*
and
learned
that
Valentin
was
still
sleeping
;
the
surgeon
,
who
had
had
*NL*
a
fairly
tranquil
night
,
was
at
present
sitting
with
him
.
Before
M.
de
*NL*
Grosjoyaux
's
associate
reappeared
,
Newman
learned
that
his
name
was
M.
*NL*
Ledoux
,
and
that
Bellegarde
's
acquaintance
with
him
dated
from
the
days
*NL*
when
they
served
together
in
the
Pontifical
Zouaves
.
M.
Ledoux
was
the
*NL*
nephew
of
a
distinguished
Ultramontane
bishop
.
At
last
the
bishop
's
*NL*
nephew
came
in
with
a
toilet
in
which
an
ingenious
attempt
at
harmony
*NL*
with
the
peculiar
situation
was
visible
,
and
with
a
gravity
tempered
by
*NL*
a
decent
deference
to
the
best
breakfast
that
the
Croix
Helvetique
*NL*
had
ever
set
forth
.
Valentin
's
servant
,
who
was
allowed
only
in
scanty
*NL*
measure
the
honor
of
watching
with
his
master
,
had
been
lending
a
light
*NL*
Parisian
hand
in
the
kitchen
.
The
two
Frenchmen
did
their
best
to
prove
*NL*
that
if
circumstances
might
overshadow
,
they
could
not
really
obscure
,
*NL*
the
national
talent
for
conversation
,
and
M.
Ledoux
delivered
a
neat
*NL*
little
eulogy
on
poor
Bellegarde
,
whom
he
pronounced
the
most
charming
*NL*
Englishman
he
had
ever
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
him
an
Englishman
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Ledoux
smiled
a
moment
and
then
made
an
epigram
.
``
C'est
plus
qu'un
*NL*
Anglais
--
c'est
un
Anglomane
!
''
Newman
said
soberly
that
he
had
never
*NL*
noticed
it
;
and
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
remarked
that
it
was
really
too
soon
*NL*
to
deliver
a
funeral
oration
upon
poor
Bellegarde
.
``
Evidently
,
''
said
M.
*NL*
Ledoux
.
``
But
I
could
n't
help
observing
this
morning
to
Mr.
Newman
that
*NL*
when
a
man
has
taken
such
excellent
measures
for
his
salvation
as
our
*NL*
dear
friend
did
last
evening
,
it
seems
almost
a
pity
he
should
put
it
in
*NL*
peril
again
by
returning
to
the
world
.
''
M.
Ledoux
was
a
great
Catholic
,
*NL*
and
Newman
thought
him
a
queer
mixture
.
His
countenance
,
by
daylight
,
*NL*
had
a
sort
of
amiably
saturnine
cast
;
he
had
a
very
large
thin
nose
,
*NL*
and
looked
like
a
Spanish
picture
.
He
appeared
to
think
dueling
a
very
*NL*
perfect
arrangement
,
provided
,
if
one
should
get
hit
,
one
could
promptly
*NL*
see
the
priest
.
He
seemed
to
take
a
great
satisfaction
in
Valentin
's
*NL*
interview
with
the
cure
,
and
yet
his
conversation
did
not
at
all
*NL*
indicate
a
sanctimonious
habit
of
mind
.
M.
Ledoux
had
evidently
a
high
*NL*
sense
of
the
becoming
,
and
was
prepared
to
be
urbane
and
tasteful
on
all
*NL*
points
.
He
was
always
furnished
with
a
smile
-LRB-
which
pushed
his
mustache
*NL*
up
under
his
nose
-RRB-
and
an
explanation
.
Savoir-vivre
--
knowing
how
to
*NL*
live
--
was
his
specialty
,
in
which
he
included
knowing
how
to
die
;
but
,
*NL*
as
Newman
reflected
,
with
a
good
deal
of
dumb
irritation
,
he
seemed
*NL*
disposed
to
delegate
to
others
the
application
of
his
learning
on
this
*NL*
latter
point
.
M.
de
Grosjoyaux
was
of
quite
another
complexion
,
and
*NL*
appeared
to
regard
his
friend
's
theological
unction
as
the
sign
of
an
*NL*
inaccessibly
superior
mind
.
He
was
evidently
doing
his
utmost
,
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
jovial
tenderness
,
to
make
life
agreeable
to
Valentin
to
the
*NL*
last
,
and
help
him
as
little
as
possible
to
miss
the
Boulevard
des
*NL*
Italiens
;
but
what
chiefly
occupied
his
mind
was
the
mystery
of
a
*NL*
bungling
brewer
's
son
making
so
neat
a
shot
.
He
himself
could
snuff
a
*NL*
candle
,
etc.
,
and
yet
he
confessed
that
he
could
not
have
done
better
*NL*
than
this
.
He
hastened
to
add
that
on
the
present
occasion
he
would
have
*NL*
made
a
point
of
not
doing
so
well
.
It
was
not
an
occasion
for
that
*NL*
sort
of
murderous
work
,
que
diable
!
He
would
have
picked
out
some
quiet
*NL*
fleshy
spot
and
just
tapped
it
with
a
harmless
ball
.
M.
Stanislas
Kapp
*NL*
had
been
deplorably
heavy-handed
;
but
really
,
when
the
world
had
come
to
*NL*
that
pass
that
one
granted
a
meeting
to
a
brewer
's
son
!
...
This
was
M.
*NL*
de
Grosjoyaux
's
nearest
approach
to
a
generalization
.
He
kept
looking
*NL*
through
the
window
,
over
the
shoulder
of
M.
Ledoux
,
at
a
slender
tree
*NL*
which
stood
at
the
end
of
a
lane
,
opposite
to
the
inn
,
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
measuring
its
distance
from
his
extended
arm
and
secretly
wishing
that
,
*NL*
since
the
subject
had
been
introduced
,
propriety
did
not
forbid
a
little
*NL*
speculative
pistol-practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
in
no
humor
to
enjoy
good
company
.
He
could
neither
eat
nor
*NL*
talk
;
his
soul
was
sore
with
grief
and
anger
,
and
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
double
sorrow
was
intolerable
.
He
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
*NL*
plate
,
counting
the
minutes
,
wishing
at
one
moment
that
Valentin
would
*NL*
see
him
and
leave
him
free
to
go
in
quest
of
Madame
de
Cintre
and
his
*NL*
lost
happiness
,
and
mentally
calling
himself
a
vile
brute
the
next
,
for
*NL*
the
impatient
egotism
of
the
wish
.
He
was
very
poor
company
,
himself
,
*NL*
and
even
his
acute
preoccupation
and
his
general
lack
of
the
habit
of
*NL*
pondering
the
impression
he
produced
did
not
prevent
him
from
reflecting
*NL*
that
his
companions
must
be
puzzled
to
see
how
poor
Bellegarde
came
to
*NL*
take
such
a
fancy
to
this
taciturn
Yankee
that
he
must
needs
have
him
at
*NL*
his
death-bed
.
After
breakfast
he
strolled
forth
alone
into
the
village
*NL*
and
looked
at
the
fountain
,
the
geese
,
the
open
barn
doors
,
the
brown
,
*NL*
bent
old
women
,
showing
their
hugely
darned
stocking-heels
at
the
ends
*NL*
of
their
slowly-clicking
sabots
,
and
the
beautiful
view
of
snowy
*NL*
Alps
and
purple
Jura
at
either
end
of
the
little
street
.
The
day
was
*NL*
brilliant
;
early
spring
was
in
the
air
and
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
*NL*
winter
's
damp
was
trickling
out
of
the
cottage
eaves
.
It
was
birth
*NL*
and
brightness
for
all
nature
,
even
for
chirping
chickens
and
waddling
*NL*
goslings
,
and
it
was
to
be
death
and
burial
for
poor
,
foolish
,
generous
,
*NL*
delightful
Bellegarde
.
Newman
walked
as
far
as
the
village
church
,
and
*NL*
went
into
the
small
grave-yard
beside
it
,
where
he
sat
down
and
looked
*NL*
at
the
awkward
tablets
which
were
planted
around
.
They
were
all
sordid
*NL*
and
hideous
,
and
Newman
could
feel
nothing
but
the
hardness
and
coldness
*NL*
of
death
.
He
got
up
and
came
back
to
the
inn
,
where
he
found
M.
Ledoux
*NL*
having
coffee
and
a
cigarette
at
a
little
green
table
which
he
had
*NL*
caused
to
be
carried
into
the
small
garden
.
Newman
,
learning
that
the
*NL*
doctor
was
still
sitting
with
Valentin
,
asked
M.
Ledoux
if
he
might
not
*NL*
be
allowed
to
relieve
him
;
he
had
a
great
desire
to
be
useful
to
his
*NL*
poor
friend
.
This
was
easily
arranged
;
the
doctor
was
very
glad
to
go
*NL*
to
bed
.
He
was
a
youthful
and
rather
jaunty
practitioner
,
but
he
had
a
*NL*
clever
face
,
and
the
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
in
his
buttonhole
;
*NL*
Newman
listened
attentively
to
the
instructions
he
gave
him
before
*NL*
retiring
,
and
took
mechanically
from
his
hand
a
small
volume
which
the
*NL*
surgeon
recommended
as
a
help
to
wakefulness
,
and
which
turned
out
to
be
*NL*
an
old
copy
of
``
Faublas
.
''
Valentin
was
still
lying
with
his
eyes
closed
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
visible
change
in
his
condition
.
Newman
sat
down
near
*NL*
him
,
and
for
a
long
time
narrowly
watched
him
.
Then
his
eyes
wandered
*NL*
away
with
his
thoughts
upon
his
own
situation
,
and
rested
upon
the
chain
*NL*
of
the
Alps
,
disclosed
by
the
drawing
of
the
scant
white
cotton
curtain
*NL*
of
the
window
,
through
which
the
sunshine
passed
and
lay
in
squares
upon
*NL*
the
red-tiled
floor
.
He
tried
to
interweave
his
reflections
with
hope
,
*NL*
but
he
only
half
succeeded
.
What
had
happened
to
him
seemed
to
have
,
in
*NL*
its
violence
and
audacity
,
the
force
of
a
real
calamity
--
the
strength
*NL*
and
insolence
of
Destiny
herself
.
It
was
unnatural
and
monstrous
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
arms
against
it
.
At
last
a
sound
struck
upon
the
stillness
,
and
*NL*
he
heard
Valentin
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
about
me
you
are
pulling
that
long
face
!
''
He
found
,
when
he
*NL*
turned
,
that
Valentin
was
lying
in
the
same
position
;
but
his
eyes
*NL*
were
open
,
and
he
was
even
trying
to
smile
.
It
was
with
a
very
slender
*NL*
strength
that
he
returned
the
pressure
of
Newman
's
hand
.
``
I
have
been
*NL*
watching
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
''
Valentin
went
on
;
``
you
have
been
*NL*
looking
as
black
as
thunder
.
You
are
greatly
disgusted
with
me
,
I
see
.
*NL*
Well
,
of
course
!
So
am
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
not
scold
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
feel
too
badly
.
And
how
are
*NL*
you
getting
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
getting
off
!
They
have
quite
settled
that
;
have
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
you
to
settle
;
you
can
get
well
if
you
try
,
''
said
Newman
,
*NL*
with
resolute
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
how
can
I
try
?
Trying
is
violent
exercise
,
and
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
is
n't
in
order
for
a
man
with
a
hole
in
his
side
as
big
as
*NL*
your
hat
,
that
begins
to
bleed
if
he
moves
a
hair
's
-
breadth
.
I
knew
you
*NL*
would
come
,
''
he
continued
;
``
I
knew
I
should
wake
up
and
find
you
here
;
*NL*
so
I
'm
not
surprised
.
But
last
night
I
was
very
impatient
.
I
did
n't
see
*NL*
how
I
could
keep
still
until
you
came
.
It
was
a
matter
of
keeping
still
,
*NL*
just
like
this
;
as
still
as
a
mummy
in
his
case
.
You
talk
about
trying
;
*NL*
I
tried
that
!
Well
,
here
I
am
yet
--
these
twenty
hours
.
It
seems
like
*NL*
twenty
days
.
''
Bellegarde
talked
slowly
and
feebly
,
but
distinctly
*NL*
enough
.
It
was
visible
,
however
,
that
he
was
in
extreme
pain
,
and
at
*NL*
last
he
closed
his
eyes
.
Newman
begged
him
to
remain
silent
and
spare
*NL*
himself
;
the
doctor
had
left
urgent
orders
.
``
Oh
,
''
said
Valentin
,
``
let
us
*NL*
eat
and
drink
,
for
to-morrow
--
to-morrow
''
--
and
he
paused
again
.
``
No
,
not
*NL*
to-morrow
,
perhaps
,
but
today
.
I
ca
n't
eat
and
drink
,
but
I
can
talk
.
*NL*
What
's
to
be
gained
,
at
this
pass
,
by
renun
--
renunciation
?
I
must
n't
use
*NL*
such
big
words
.
I
was
always
a
chatterer
;
Lord
,
how
I
have
talked
in
my
*NL*
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
reason
for
keeping
quiet
now
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
We
know
how
well
*NL*
you
talk
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Valentin
,
without
heeding
him
,
went
on
in
the
same
weak
,
dying
*NL*
drawl
.
``
I
wanted
to
see
you
because
you
have
seen
my
sister
.
Does
she
*NL*
know
--
will
she
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
embarrassed
.
``
Yes
,
by
this
time
she
must
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
tell
her
?
''
Valentin
asked
.
And
then
,
in
a
moment
,
``
Did
n't
*NL*
you
bring
me
any
message
from
her
?
''
His
eyes
rested
upon
Newman
's
with
a
*NL*
certain
soft
keenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
see
her
after
I
got
your
telegram
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
wrote
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
sent
you
no
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
obliged
to
reply
that
Madame
de
Cintre
had
left
Paris
.
``
She
*NL*
went
yesterday
to
Fleurieres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
--
to
Fleurieres
?
Why
did
she
go
to
Fleurieres
?
What
day
is
*NL*
this
?
What
day
was
yesterday
?
Ah
,
then
I
sha
n't
see
her
,
''
said
Valentin
,
*NL*
sadly
.
``
Fleurieres
is
too
far
!
''
And
then
he
closed
his
eyes
again
.
*NL*
Newman
sat
silent
,
summoning
pious
invention
to
his
aid
,
but
he
was
*NL*
relieved
at
finding
that
Valentin
was
apparently
too
weak
to
reason
*NL*
or
to
be
curious
.
Bellegarde
,
however
,
presently
went
on
.
``
And
my
*NL*
mother
--
and
my
brother
--
will
they
come
?
Are
they
at
Fleurieres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
in
Paris
,
but
I
did
n't
see
them
,
either
,
''
Newman
answered
.
*NL*
``
If
they
received
your
telegram
in
time
,
they
will
have
started
this
*NL*
morning
.
Otherwise
they
will
be
obliged
to
wait
for
the
night-express
,
*NL*
and
they
will
arrive
at
the
same
hour
as
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
thank
me
--
they
wo
n't
thank
me
,
''
Valentin
murmured
.
``
They
*NL*
will
pass
an
atrocious
night
,
and
Urbain
does
n't
like
the
early
*NL*
morning
air
.
I
do
n't
remember
ever
in
my
life
to
have
seen
him
before
*NL*
noon
--
before
breakfast
.
No
one
ever
saw
him
.
We
do
n't
know
how
he
is
*NL*
then
.
Perhaps
he
's
different
.
Who
knows
?
Posterity
,
perhaps
,
will
*NL*
know
.
That
's
the
time
he
works
,
in
his
cabinet
,
at
the
history
of
the
*NL*
Princesses
.
But
I
had
to
send
for
them
--
had
n't
I
?
And
then
I
want
to
*NL*
see
my
mother
sit
there
where
you
sit
,
and
say
good-by
to
her
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
after
all
,
I
do
n't
know
her
,
and
she
will
have
some
surprise
for
me
.
*NL*
Do
n't
think
you
know
her
yet
,
yourself
;
perhaps
she
may
surprise
YOU
.
*NL*
But
if
I
ca
n't
see
Claire
,
I
do
n't
care
for
anything
.
I
have
been
*NL*
thinking
of
it
--
and
in
my
dreams
,
too
.
Why
did
she
go
to
Fleurieres
*NL*
to-day
?
She
never
told
me
.
What
has
happened
?
Ah
,
she
ought
to
have
*NL*
guessed
I
was
here
--
this
way
.
It
is
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
ever
*NL*
disappointed
me
.
Poor
Claire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
we
are
not
man
and
wife
quite
yet
,
--
your
sister
and
I
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
.
``
She
does
n't
yet
account
to
me
for
all
her
actions
.
''
And
,
after
*NL*
a
fashion
,
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
looked
at
him
a
moment
.
``
Have
you
quarreled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
,
never
!
''
Newman
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
happily
you
say
that
!
''
said
Valentin
.
``
You
are
going
to
be
*NL*
happy
--
VA
!
''
In
answer
to
this
stroke
of
irony
,
none
the
less
powerful
*NL*
for
being
so
unconscious
,
all
poor
Newman
could
do
was
to
give
a
*NL*
helpless
and
transparent
stare
.
Valentin
continued
to
fix
him
with
his
*NL*
own
rather
over-bright
gaze
,
and
presently
he

my

This
is
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
strongly
moved
.
He
got
up
and
turned
his
back
upon
his
friend
*NL*
and
walked
away
to
the
window
,
where
he
stood
looking
out
,
but
only
*NL*
vaguely
seeing
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
like
the
look
of
your
back

''
Valentin
*NL*
continued
.
``
I
have
always
been
an
observer
of
backs
;
yours
is
quite
out
*NL*
of
sorts

''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
returned
to
his
bedside
and
begged
him
to
be
quiet
.
``
Be
quiet
and
*NL*
get
well

he
said
.
``
That

what

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Valentin
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
let

You
were
always
curious

there
*NL*
is
something

''
Newman
answered
,
with
resolute
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
a
long
time
without
speaking
.
He
seemed
*NL*
even
to
have
fallen
asleep
.
But
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
began
to
*NL*
talk
again
.
``
I
am
rather
sorry
about
that
place
in
the
bank
.
Who
knows
*NL*
but
what
I
might
have
become
another
Rothschild
?
But
I
was
n't
meant
for
*NL*
a
banker
;
bankers
are
not
so
easy
to
kill
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
have
*NL*
been
very
easy
to
kill
?
It
's
not
like
a
serious
man
.
It
's
really
very
*NL*
mortifying
.
It
's
like
telling
your
hostess
you
must
go
,
when
you
count
*NL*
upon
her
begging
you
to
stay
,
and
then
finding
she
does
no
such
thing
.
*NL*
`
Really
--
so
soon
?
You
've
only
just
come
!

Life
does
n't
make
me
any
such
*NL*
polite
little
speech
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
for
some
time
said
nothing
,
but
at
last
he
broke
out
.
``
It
's
a
bad
*NL*
case
--
it
's
a
bad
case
--
it
's
the
worst
case
I
ever
met
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
say
anything
unpleasant
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
've
seen
men
dying
*NL*
before
--
and
I
've
seen
men
shot
.
But
it
always
seemed
more
natural
;
they
*NL*
were
not
so
clever
as
you
.
Damnation
--
damnation
!
You
might
have
done
*NL*
something
better
than
this
.
It
's
about
the
meanest
winding-up
of
a
man
's
*NL*
affairs
that
I
can
imagine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
feebly
waved
his
hand
to
and
fro
.
``
Do
n't
insist
--
do
n't
insist
!
*NL*
It
is
mean
--
decidedly
mean
.
For
you
see
at
the
bottom
--
down
at
the
*NL*
bottom
,
in
a
little
place
as
small
as
the
end
of
a
wine-funnel
--
I
agree
*NL*
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
after
this
the
doctor
put
his
head
through
the
half-opened
*NL*
door
and
,
perceiving
that
Valentin
was
awake
,
came
in
and
felt
his
*NL*
pulse
.
He
shook
his
head
and
declared
that
he
had
talked
too
much
--
ten
*NL*
times
too
much
.
``
Nonsense
!
''
said
Valentin
;
``
a
man
sentenced
to
death
can
*NL*
never
talk
too
much
.
Have
you
never
read
an
account
of
an
execution
in
*NL*
a
newspaper
?
Do
n't
they
always
set
a
lot
of
people
at
the
*NL*
prisoner
--
lawyers
,
reporters
,
priests
--
to
make
him
talk
?
But
it
's
not
*NL*
Mr.
Newman
's
fault
;
he
sits
there
as
mum
as
a
death
's
-
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
observed
that
it
was
time
his
patient
's
wound
should
be
*NL*
dressed
again
;
MM
.
de
Grosjoyaux
and
Ledoux
,
who
had
already
witnessed
*NL*
this
delicate
operation
,
taking
Newman
's
place
as
assistants
.
Newman
*NL*
withdrew
and
learned
from
his
fellow-watchers
that
they
had
received
a
*NL*
telegram
from
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
to
the
effect
that
their
message
had
*NL*
been
delivered
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
too
late
to
allow
him
to
*NL*
take
the
morning
train
,
but
that
he
would
start
with
his
mother
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
Newman
wandered
away
into
the
village
again
,
and
walked
about
*NL*
restlessly
for
two
or
three
hours
.
The
day
seemed
terribly
long
.
At
dusk
*NL*
he
came
back
and
dined
with
the
doctor
and
M.
Ledoux
.
The
dressing
of
*NL*
Valentin
's
wound
had
been
a
very
critical
operation
;
the
doctor
did
n't
*NL*
really
see
how
he
was
to
endure
a
repetition
of
it
.
He
then
declared
*NL*
that
he
must
beg
of
Mr.
Newman
to
deny
himself
for
the
present
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
sitting
with
M.
de
Bellegarde
;
more
than
any
one
else
,
*NL*
apparently
,
he
had
the
flattering
but
inconvenient
privilege
of
exciting
*NL*
him
.
M.
Ledoux
,
at
this
,
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
in
silence
;
he
must
*NL*
have
been
wondering
what
the
deuce
Bellegarde
found
so
exciting
in
the
*NL*
American
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
after
dinner
,
went
up
to
his
room
,
where
he
sat
for
a
long
time
*NL*
staring
at
his
lighted
candle
,
and
thinking
that
Valentin
was
dying
*NL*
down-stairs
.
Late
,
when
the
candle
had
burnt
low
,
there
came
a
soft
rap
*NL*
at
his
door
.
The
doctor
stood
there
with
a
candlestick
and
a
shrug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
amuse
himself
,
still
!
''
said
Valentin
's
medical
adviser
.
``
He
*NL*
insists
upon
seeing
you
,
and
I
am
afraid
you
must
come
.
I
think
at
this
*NL*
rate
,
that
he
will
hardly
outlast
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
went
back
to
Valentin
's
room
,
which
he
found
lighted
by
a
taper
*NL*
on
the
hearth
.
Valentin
begged
him
to
light
a
candle
.
``
I
want
to
see
*NL*
your
face
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
say
you
excite
me
,
''
he
went
on
,
as
Newman
*NL*
complied
with
this
request
,
``
and
I
confess
I
do
feel
excited
.
But
it
*NL*
is
n't
you
--
it
's
my
own
thoughts
.
I
have
been
thinking
--
thinking
.
Sit
*NL*
down
there
,
and
let
me
look
at
you
again
.
''
Newman
seated
himself
,
folded
*NL*
his
arms
,
and
bent
a
heavy
gaze
upon
his
friend
.
He
seemed
to
be
playing
*NL*
a
part
,
mechanically
,
in
a
lugubrious
comedy
.
Valentin
looked
at
him
for
*NL*
some
time
.
``
Yes
,
this
morning
I
was
right
;
you
have
something
on
your
*NL*
mind
heavier
than
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
.
Come
,
I
'm
a
dying
man
and
it
's
*NL*
indecent
to
deceive
me
.
Something
happened
after
I
left
Paris
.
It
was
*NL*
not
for
nothing
that
my
sister
started
off
at
this
season
of
the
year
*NL*
for
Fleurieres
.
Why
was
it
?
It
sticks
in
my
crop
.
I
have
been
thinking
*NL*
it
over
,
and
if
you
do
n't
tell
me
I
shall
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
better
not
tell
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
wo
n't
do
you
any
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
it
will
do
me
any
good
not
to
tell
me
,
you
are
very
much
*NL*
mistaken
.
There
is
trouble
about
your
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
There
is
trouble
about
my
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
And
Valentin
was
silent
again
.
``
They
have
stopped
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
stopped
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
Now
that
he
had
spoken
out
,
he
*NL*
found
a
satisfaction
in
it
which
deepened
as
he
went
on
.
``
Your
mother
*NL*
and
brother
have
broken
faith
.
They
have
decided
that
it
ca
n't
take
*NL*
place
.
They
have
decided
that
I
am
not
good
enough
,
after
all
.
They
have
*NL*
taken
back
their
word
.
Since
you
insist
,
there
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
gave
a
sort
of
groan
,
lifted
his
hands
a
moment
,
and
then
let
*NL*
them
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
not
to
have
anything
better
to
tell
you
about
them
,
''
Newman
*NL*
pursued
.
``
But
it
's
not
my
fault
.
I
was
,
indeed
,
very
unhappy
when
your
*NL*
telegram
reached
me
;
I
was
quite
upside
down
.
You
may
imagine
whether
I
*NL*
feel
any
better
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
moaned
gaspingly
,
as
if
his
wound
were
throbbing
.
``
Broken
*NL*
faith
,
broken
faith
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
And
my
sister
--
my
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
is
very
unhappy

she
has
consented

up

I
do

I
do
n't
know
what
they
have
done
to
her

it
must
be
something
*NL*
pretty
bad

In
justice
to
her
you
ought
to
know
it

They
have
made
*NL*
her
suffer

I
have
n't
seen
her
alone
,
but
only
before
them
!
We
had
an
*NL*
interview
yesterday
morning
.
They
came
out
,
flat
,
in
so
many
words
.
They
*NL*
told
me
to
go
about
my
business
.
It
seems
to
me
a
very
bad
case

I
'm
*NL*
angry

I
'm
sore
,
I
'm
sick

''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
lay
there
staring
,
with
his
eyes
more
brilliantly
lighted
,
his
*NL*
lips
soundlessly
parted
,
and
a
flush
of
color
in
his
pale
face
.
Newman
*NL*
had
never
before
uttered
so
many
words
in
the
plaintive
key
,
but
now
,
*NL*
in
speaking
to
Valentin
in
the
poor
fellow
's
extremity
,
he
had
a
feeling
*NL*
that
he
was
making
his
complaint
somewhere
within
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
power
that
men
pray
to
in
trouble
;
he
felt
his
outgush
of
resentment
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
spiritual
privilege
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Claire
,
''
--
said
Bellegarde
,
--
``
Claire
?
She
has
given
you
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
really

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

murmured
Valentin
.
``
But
they
--
but

and
he
paused
*NL*
again
.
``
You
saw
them
;
they
dismissed
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Face

They
were
very
explicit

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
said

*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
Newman
's
arm
.
``
And
about
*NL*
their
promise
--
their
engagement
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
made
a
distinction

They
said
it
was
to
hold
good
only
until
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
accepted
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
lay
staring
a
while
,
and
his
flush
died
away
.
``
Do
n't
tell
me
*NL*
any
more
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
I
'm
ashamed

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
You
are
the
soul
of
honor

said
Newman
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
groaned
and
turned
away
his
head
.
For
some
time
nothing
more
*NL*
was
said
.
Then
Valentin
turned
back
again
and
found
a
certain
force
to
*NL*
press
Newman
's
arm
.
``
It
's
very
bad
--
very
bad
.
When
my
people
--
when
*NL*
my
race

come
to
that
,
it
is
time
for
me
to
withdraw

I
believe
in

my

she
will
explain

Excuse
her

if
she
ca

*NL*
forgive
her

She
has
suffered

But
for
the
others
it
is
very
bad

very
*NL*
bad
.
You
take
it
very
hard
?
No
,
it
's
a
shame
to
make
you
say
so

''
He
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
and
again
there
was
a
silence
.
Newman
felt
almost
awed
;
*NL*
he
had
evoked
a
more
solemn
spirit
than
he
expected
.
Presently
Valentin
*NL*
looked
at
him
again
,
removing
his
hand
from
his
arm
.
``
I
apologize
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Do
you
understand
?
Here
on
my
death-bed
.
I
apologize
for

my

For
the
ancient
house

*NL*
Bellegarde

Voila

''
he
added
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
for
an
answer
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
with
a
world
of
*NL*
kindness
.
Valentin
remained
quiet
,
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
*NL*
doctor
softly
came
in
.
Behind
him
,
through
the
half-open
door
,
Newman
*NL*
saw
the
two
questioning
faces
of
MM
.
de
Grosjoyaux
and
Ledoux
.
The
*NL*
doctor
laid
his
hand
on
Valentin
's
wrist
and
sat
looking
at
him
.
He
gave
*NL*
no
sign
and
the
two
gentlemen
came
in
,
M.
Ledoux
having
first
beckoned
*NL*
to
some
one
outside
.
This
was
M.
le
cure
,
who
carried
in
his
hand
an
*NL*
object
unknown
to
Newman
,
and
covered
with
a
white
napkin
.
M.
le
cure
*NL*
was
short
,
round
,
and
red
:
he
advanced
,
pulling
off
his
little
black
cap
*NL*
to
Newman
,
and
deposited
his
burden
on
the
table
;
and
then
he
sat
down
*NL*
in
the
best
arm-chair
,
with
his
hands
folded
across
his
person
.
The
*NL*
other
gentlemen
had
exchanged
glances
which
expressed
unanimity
as
to
*NL*
the
timeliness
of
their
presence
.
But
for
a
long
time
Valentin
neither
*NL*
spoke
nor
moved
.
It
was
Newman
's
belief
,
afterwards
,
that
M.
le
cure
*NL*
went
to
sleep
.
At
last
abruptly
,
Valentin
pronounced
Newman
's
name
.
His
*NL*
friend
went
to
him
,
and
he
said
in
French
,
``
You
are
not
alone
.
I
want
to
*NL*
speak
to
you
alone
.
''
Newman
looked
at
the
doctor
,
and
the
doctor
looked
*NL*
at
the
cure
,
who
looked
back
at
him
;
and
then
the
doctor
and
the
cure
,
*NL*
together
,
gave
a
shrug
.
``
Alone
--
for
five
minutes
,
''
Valentin
repeated
.
*NL*
``
Please
leave
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
took
up
his
burden
again
and
led
the
way
out
,
followed
by
*NL*
his
companions
.
Newman
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
came
back
to
*NL*
Valentin
's
bedside
.
Bellegarde
had
watched
all
this
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
bad
,
it
's
very
bad
,
''
he
said
,
after
Newman
had
seated
himself
*NL*
close
to
him
.
``
The
more
I
think
of
it
the
worse
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
think
of
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Valentin
went
on
,
without
heeding
him
.
``
Even
if
they
should
come
*NL*
round
again
,
the
shame
--
the
baseness
--
is
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
wo
n't
come
round
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
make
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
something
--
a
great
secret
--
an
immense
secret
.
You
can
*NL*
use
it
against
them
--
frighten
them
,
force
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
secret
!
''
Newman
repeated
.
The
idea
of
letting
Valentin
,
on
his
*NL*
death-bed
,
confide
him
an
``
immense
secret
''
shocked
him
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
and
made
him
draw
back
.
It
seemed
an
illicit
way
of
arriving
at
*NL*
information
,
and
even
had
a
vague
analogy
with
listening
at
a
key-hole
.
*NL*
Then
,
suddenly
,
the
thought
of
``
forcing
''
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
*NL*
son
became
attractive
,
and
Newman
bent
his
head
closer
to
Valentin
's
*NL*
lips
.
For
some
time
,
however
,
the
dying
man
said
nothing
more
.
He
only
*NL*
lay
and
looked
at
his
friend
with
his
kindled
,
expanded
,
troubled
eye
,
*NL*
and
Newman
began
to
believe
that
he
had
spoken
in
delirium
.
But
at
last
*NL*
he
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
something
done
--
something
done
at
Fleurieres
.
It
was
foul
*NL*
play
.
My
father
--
something
happened
to
him
.
I
do
n't
know
;
I
have
been
*NL*
ashamed
--
afraid
to
know
.
But
I
know
there
is
something
.
My
mother
*NL*
knows
--
Urbain
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
happened
to
your
father
?
''
said
Newman
,
urgently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
looked
at
him
,
still
more
wide-eyed
.
``
He
did
n't
get
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
well
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
immense
effort
which
Valentin
had
made
,
first
to
decide
to
utter
*NL*
these
words
and
then
to
bring
them
out
,
appeared
to
have
taken
his
last
*NL*
strength
.
He
lapsed
again
into
silence
,
and
Newman
sat
watching
him
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
understand
?
''
he
began
again
,
presently
.
``
At
Fleurieres
.
You
can
find
*NL*
out
.
Mrs.
Bread
knows
.
Tell
her
I
begged
you
to
ask
her
.
Then
tell
them
*NL*
that
,
and
see
.
It
may
help
you
.
If
not
,
tell
,
every
one
.
It
will
--
it
*NL*
will
''
--
here
Valentin
's
voice
sank
to
the
feeblest
murmur
--
``
it
will
*NL*
avenge
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
died
away
in
a
long
,
soft
groan
.
Newman
stood
up
,
deeply
*NL*
impressed
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
;
his
heart
was
beating
violently
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
I
am
much
obliged
.
''
But
Valentin
seemed
*NL*
not
to
hear
him
,
he
remained
silent
,
and
his
silence
continued
.
At
*NL*
last
Newman
went
and
opened
the
door
.
M.
le
cure
reentered
,
bearing
*NL*
his
sacred
vessel
and
followed
by
the
three
gentlemen
and
by
Valentin
's
*NL*
servant
.
It
was
almost
processional
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
died
,
tranquilly
,
just
as
the
cold
,
faint
March
*NL*
dawn
began
to
illumine
the
faces
of
the
little
knot
of
friends
gathered
*NL*
about
his
bedside
.
An
hour
afterwards
Newman
left
the
inn
and
drove
*NL*
to
Geneva
;
he
was
naturally
unwilling
to
be
present
at
the
arrival
of
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
first-born
.
At
Geneva
,
for
the
moment
,
he
*NL*
remained
.
He
was
like
a
man
who
has
had
a
fall
and
wants
to
sit
still
*NL*
and
count
his
bruises
.
He
instantly
wrote
to
Madame
de
Cintre
,
*NL*
relating
to
her
the
circumstances
of
her
brother
's
death
--
with
certain
*NL*
exceptions
--
and
asking
her
what
was
the
earliest
moment
at
which
he
*NL*
might
hope
that
she
would
consent
to
see
him
.
M.
Ledoux
had
told
him
*NL*
that
he
had
reason
to
know
that
Valentin
's
will
--
Bellegarde
had
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
elegant
personal
property
to
dispose
of
--
contained
a
request
*NL*
that
he
should
be
buried
near
his
father
in
the
church-yard
of
*NL*
Fleurieres
,
and
Newman
intended
that
the
state
of
his
own
relations
with
*NL*
the
family
should
not
deprive
him
of
the
satisfaction
of
helping
to
pay
*NL*
the
last
earthly
honors
to
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
.
He
reflected
*NL*
that
Valentin
's
friendship
was
older
than
Urbain
's
enmity
,
and
that
at
*NL*
a
funeral
it
was
easy
to
escape
notice
.
Madame
de
Cintre
's
answer
to
his
*NL*
letter
enabled
him
to
time
his
arrival
at
Fleurieres
.
This
answer
was
*NL*
very
brief
;
it
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
for
your
letter
,
and
for
your
being
with
Valentin
.
It
is
*NL*
a
most
inexpressible
sorrow
to
me
that
I
was
not
.
To
see
you
will
be
*NL*
nothing
but
a
distress
to
me
;
there
is
no
need
,
therefore
,
to
wait
for
*NL*
what
you
call
brighter
days
.
It
is
all
one
now
,
and
I
shall
have
no
*NL*
brighter
days
.
Come
when
you
please
;
only
notify
me
first
.
My
brother
is
*NL*
to
be
buried
here
on
Friday
,
and
my
family
is
to
remain
here
.

As
soon
as
he
received
this
letter
Newman
went
straight
to
Paris
and
to
*NL*
Poitiers
.
The
journey
took
him
far
southward
,
through
green
Touraine
*NL*
and
across
the
far-shining
Loire
,
into
a
country
where
the
early
spring
*NL*
deepened
about
him
as
he
went
.
But
he
had
never
made
a
journey
during
*NL*
which
he
heeded
less
what
he
would
have
called
the
lay
of
the
land
.
He
*NL*
obtained
lodging
at
the
inn
at
Poitiers
,
and
the
next
morning
drove
in
*NL*
a
couple
of
hours
to
the
village
of
Fleurieres
.
But
here
,
preoccupied
*NL*
though
he
was
,
he
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
picturesqueness
of
the
*NL*
place
.
It
was
what
the
French
call
a
petit
bourg
;
it
lay
at
the
base
of
*NL*
a
sort
of
huge
mound
on
the
summit
of
which
stood
the
crumbling
ruins
of
*NL*
a
feudal
castle
,
much
of
whose
sturdy
material
,
as
well
as
that
of
*NL*
the
wall
which
dropped
along
the
hill
to
inclose
the
clustered
houses
*NL*
defensively
,
had
been
absorbed
into
the
very
substance
of
the
village
.
*NL*
The
church
was
simply
the
former
chapel
of
the
castle
,
fronting
upon
its
*NL*
grass-grown
court
,
which
,
however
,
was
of
generous
enough
width
to
*NL*
have
given
up
its
quaintest
corner
to
a
little
graveyard
.
Here
the
very
*NL*
headstones
themselves
seemed
to
sleep
,
as
they
slanted
into
the
grass
;
*NL*
the
patient
elbow
of
the
rampart
held
them
together
on
one
side
,
and
in
*NL*
front
,
far
beneath
their
mossy
lids
,
the
green
plains
and
blue
distances
*NL*
stretched
away
.
The
way
to
church
,
up
the
hill
,
was
impracticable
to
*NL*
vehicles
.
It
was
lined
with
peasants
,
two
or
three
rows
deep
,
who
stood
*NL*
watching
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
slowly
ascend
it
,
on
the
arm
of
her
*NL*
elder
son
,
behind
the
pall-bearers
of
the
other
.
Newman
chose
to
lurk
*NL*
among
the
common
mourners
who
murmured
``
Madame
la
Comtesse
''
as
a
tall
*NL*
figure
veiled
in
black
passed
before
them
.
He
stood
in
the
dusky
little
*NL*
church
while
the
service
was
going
forward
,
but
at
the
dismal
tomb-side
*NL*
he
turned
away
and
walked
down
the
hill
.
He
went
back
to
Poitiers
,
*NL*
and
spent
two
days
in
which
patience
and
impatience
were
singularly
*NL*
commingled
.
On
the
third
day
he
sent
Madame
de
Cintre
a
note
,
saying
*NL*
that
he
would
call
upon
her
in
the
afternoon
,
and
in
accordance
with
*NL*
this
he
again
took
his
way
to
Fleurieres
.
He
left
his
vehicle
at
the
*NL*
tavern
in
the
village
street
,
and
obeyed
the
simple
instructions
which
*NL*
were
given
him
for
finding
the
chateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
just
beyond
there
,
''
said
the
landlord
,
and
pointed
to
the
*NL*
tree-tops
of
the
park
,
above
the
opposite
houses
.
Newman
followed
the
*NL*
first
cross-road
to
the
right
--
it
was
bordered
with
mouldy
cottages
--
and
*NL*
in
a
few
moments
saw
before
him
the
peaked
roofs
of
the
towers
.
*NL*
Advancing
farther
,
he
found
himself
before
a
vast
iron
gate
,
rusty
and
*NL*
closed
;
here
he
paused
a
moment
,
looking
through
the
bars
.
The
chateau
*NL*
was
near
the
road
;
this
was
at
once
its
merit
and
its
defect
;
but
its
*NL*
aspect
was
extremely
impressive
.
Newman
learned
afterwards
,
from
a
*NL*
guide-book
of
the
province
,
that
it
dated
from
the
time
of
Henry
IV
.
It
*NL*
presented
to
the
wide
,
paved
area
which
preceded
it
and
which
was
edged
*NL*
with
shabby
farm-buildings
an
immense
facade
of
dark
time-stained
*NL*
brick
,
flanked
by
two
low
wings
,
each
of
which
terminated
in
a
little
*NL*
Dutch-looking
pavilion
capped
with
a
fantastic
roof
.
Two
towers
rose
*NL*
behind
,
and
behind
the
towers
was
a
mass
of
elms
and
beeches
,
now
just
*NL*
faintly
green
.
But
the
great
feature
was
a
wide
,
green
river
which
*NL*
washed
the
foundations
of
the
chateau
.
The
building
rose
from
an
island
*NL*
in
the
circling
stream
,
so
that
this
formed
a
perfect
moat
spanned
by
*NL*
a
two-arched
bridge
without
a
parapet
.
The
dull
brick
walls
,
which
here
*NL*
and
there
made
a
grand
,
straight
sweep
;
the
ugly
little
cupolas
of
the
*NL*
wings
,
the
deep-set
windows
,
the
long
,
steep
pinnacles
of
mossy
slate
,
*NL*
all
mirrored
themselves
in
the
tranquil
river
.
Newman
rang
at
the
gate
,
*NL*
and
was
almost
frightened
at
the
tone
with
which
a
big
rusty
bell
above
*NL*
his
head
replied
to
him
.
An
old
woman
came
out
from
the
gate-house
and
*NL*
opened
the
creaking
portal
just
wide
enough
for
him
to
pass
,
and
he
went
*NL*
in
,
across
the
dry
,
bare
court
and
the
little
cracked
white
slabs
of
*NL*
the
causeway
on
the
moat
.
At
the
door
of
the
chateau
he
waited
for
some
*NL*
moments
,
and
this
gave
him
a
chance
to
observe
that
Fleurieres
was
not
*NL*
``
kept
up
,
''
and
to
reflect
that
it
was
a
melancholy
place
of
residence
.
*NL*
``
It
looks
,
''
said
Newman
to
himself
--
and
I
give
the
comparison
for
what
*NL*
it
is
worth
--
``
like
a
Chinese
penitentiary
.
''
At
last
the
door
was
opened
*NL*
by
a
servant
whom
he
remembered
to
have
seen
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
.
*NL*
The
man
's
dull
face
brightened
as
he
perceived
our
hero
,
for
Newman
,
for
*NL*
indefinable
reasons
,
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
liveried
gentry
.
The
*NL*
footman
led
the
way
across
a
great
central
vestibule
,
with
a
pyramid
of
*NL*
plants
in
tubs
in
the
middle
of
glass
doors
all
around
,
to
what
appeared
*NL*
to
be
the
principal
drawing-room
of
the
chateau
.
Newman
crossed
the
*NL*
threshold
of
a
room
of
superb
proportions
,
which
made
him
feel
at
first
*NL*
like
a
tourist
with
a
guide-book
and
a
cicerone
awaiting
a
fee
.
But
when
*NL*
his
guide
had
left
him
alone
,
with
the
observation
that
he
would
call
*NL*
Madame
la
Comtesse
,
Newman
perceived
that
the
salon
contained
little
*NL*
that
was
remarkable
save
a
dark
ceiling
with
curiously
carved
rafters
,
*NL*
some
curtains
of
elaborate
,
antiquated
tapestry
,
and
a
dark
oaken
floor
,
*NL*
polished
like
a
mirror
.
He
waited
some
minutes
,
walking
up
and
down
;
but
*NL*
at
length
,
as
he
turned
at
the
end
of
the
room
,
he
saw
that
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
had
come
in
by
a
distant
door
.
She
wore
a
black
dress
,
and
she
*NL*
stood
looking
at
him
.
As
the
length
of
the
immense
room
lay
between
them
*NL*
he
had
time
to
look
at
her
before
they
met
in
the
middle
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dismayed
at
the
change
in
her
appearance
.
Pale
,
heavy-browed
,
*NL*
almost
haggard
with
a
sort
of
monastic
rigidity
in
her
dress
,
she
had
*NL*
little
but
her
pure
features
in
common
with
the
woman
whose
radiant
good
*NL*
grace
he
had
hitherto
admired
.
She
let
her
eyes
rest
on
his
own
,
and
she
*NL*
let
him
take
her
hand
;
but
her
eyes
looked
like
two
rainy
autumn
moons
,
*NL*
and
her
touch
was
portentously
lifeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
your
brother
's
funeral
,
''
Newman
said
.
``
Then
I
waited
three
*NL*
days
.
But
I
could
wait
no
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
be
lost
or
gained
by
waiting
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
But
*NL*
it
was
very
considerate
of
you
to
wait
,
wronged
as
you
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
think
I
have
been
wronged
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
that
*NL*
oddly
humorous
accent
with
which
he
often
uttered
words
of
the
gravest
*NL*
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
need
to
say
so
?
''
she
asked
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
have
wronged
,
*NL*
seriously
,
many
persons
;
certainly
not
consciously
.
To
you
,
to
whom
I
*NL*
have
done
this
hard
and
cruel
thing
,
the
only
reparation
I
can
make
is
*NL*
to
say
,
'
I
know
it
,
I
feel
it
!
'
The
reparation
is
pitifully
small
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
great
step
forward
!
''
said
Newman
,
with
a
gracious
smile
of
*NL*
encouragement
.
He
pushed
a
chair
towards
her
and
held
it
,
looking
at
her
*NL*
urgently
.
She
sat
down
,
mechanically
,
and
he
seated
himself
near
*NL*
her
;
but
in
a
moment
he
got
up
,
restlessly
,
and
stood
before
her
.
She
*NL*
remained
seated
,
like
a
troubled
creature
who
had
passed
through
the
*NL*
stage
of
restlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
my
seeing
you
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
and
yet
*NL*
I
am
very
glad
you
came
.
Now
I
can
tell
you
what
I
feel
.
It
is
a
selfish
*NL*
pleasure
,
but
it
is
one
of
the
last
I
shall
have
.
''
And
she
paused
,
with
*NL*
her
great
misty
eyes
fixed
upon
him
.
``
I
know
how
I
have
deceived
and
*NL*
injured
you
;
I
know
how
cruel
and
cowardly
I
have
been
.
I
see
it
*NL*
as
vividly
as
you
do
--
I
feel
it
to
the
ends
of
my
fingers
.
''
And
she
*NL*
unclasped
her
hands
,
which
were
locked
together
in
her
lap
,
lifted
them
,
*NL*
and
dropped
them
at
her
side
.
``
Anything
that
you
may
have
said
of
me
in
*NL*
your
angriest
passion
is
nothing
to
what
I
have
said
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
angriest
passion
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
have
said
nothing
hard
of
*NL*
you
.
The
very
worst
thing
I
have
said
of
you
yet
is
that
you
are
the
*NL*
loveliest
of
women
.
''
And
he
seated
himself
before
her
again
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
a
little
,
but
even
her
flush
was
pale
.
``
That
is
because
you
*NL*
think
I
will
come
back
.
But
I
will
not
come
back
.
It
is
in
that
hope
*NL*
you
have
come
here
,
I
know
;
I
am
very
sorry
for
you
.
I
would
do
almost
*NL*
anything
for
you
.
To
say
that
,
after
what
I
have
done
,
seems
simply
*NL*
impudent
;
but
what
can
I
say
that
will
not
seem
impudent
?
To
wrong
you
*NL*
and
apologize
--
that
is
easy
enough
.
I
should
not
have
wronged
you
.
''
She
*NL*
stopped
a
moment
,
looking
at
him
,
and
motioned
him
to
let
her
go
on
.
*NL*
``
I
ought
never
to
have
listened
to
you
at
first
;
that
was
the
wrong
.
*NL*
No
good
could
come
of
it
.
I
felt
it
,
and
yet
I
listened
;
that
was
your
*NL*
fault
.
I
liked
you
too
much
;
I
believed
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
believe
in
me
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
ever
.
But
now
it
does
n't
matter
.
I
have
given
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
powerful
thump
with
his
clenched
fist
upon
his
knee
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
why
,
why
?
''
he
cried
.
``
Give
me
a
reason
--
a
decent
reason
.
You
are
not
a
*NL*
child
--
you
are
not
a
minor
,
nor
an
idiot
.
You
are
not
obliged
to
drop
me
*NL*
because
your
mother
told
you
to
.
Such
a
reason
is
n't
worthy
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
;
it
's
not
worthy
of
me
.
But
it
's
the
only
one
I
have
to
*NL*
give
.
After
all
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
throwing
out
her
hands
,
``
think
*NL*
me
an
idiot
and
forget
me
!
That
will
be
the
simplest
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
got
up
and
walked
away
with
a
crushing
sense
that
his
cause
was
*NL*
lost
,
and
yet
with
an
equal
inability
to
give
up
fighting
.
He
went
to
*NL*
one
of
the
great
windows
,
and
looked
out
at
the
stiffly
embanked
river
*NL*
and
the
formal
gardens
which
lay
beyond
it
.
When
he
turned
round
,
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
had
risen
;
she
stood
there
silent
and
passive
.
``
You
are
not
*NL*
frank
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
you
are
not
honest
.
Instead
of
saying
that
you
are
*NL*
imbecile
,
you
should
say
that
other
people
are
wicked
.
Your
mother
and
*NL*
your
brother
have
been
false
and
cruel
;
they
have
been
so
to
me
,
and
I
*NL*
am
sure
they
have
been
so
to
you
.
Why
do
you
try
to
shield
them
?
Why
do
*NL*
you
sacrifice
me
to
them
?
I
'm
not
false
;
I
'm
not
cruel
.
You
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
you
give
up
;
I
can
tell
you
that
--
you
do
n't
.
They
bully
you
and
*NL*
plot
about
you
;
and
I
--
I
''
--
And
he
paused
,
holding
out
his
hands
.
She
*NL*
turned
away
and
began
to
leave
him
.
``
You
told
me
the
other
day
that
*NL*
you
were
afraid
of
your
mother
,
''
he
said
,
following
her
.
``
What
did
you
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
shook
her
head
.
``
I
remember
;
I
was
sorry
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
sorry
when
she
came
down
and
put
on
the
thumb-screws
.
In
God
's
*NL*
name
what
IS
it
she
does
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Nothing
that
you
can
understand
.
And
now
that
I
have
given
you
*NL*
up
,
I
must
not
complain
of
her
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
reasoning
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
Complain
of
her
,
on
the
contrary
.
*NL*
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
frankly
and
trustfully
,
as
you
ought
,
and
we
will
*NL*
talk
it
over
so
satisfactorily
that
you
wo
n't
give
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
looked
down
some
moments
,
fixedly
;
and
then
,
raising
*NL*
her
eyes
,
she
said
,
``
One
good
at
least
has
come
of
this
:
I
have
made
*NL*
you
judge
me
more
fairly
.
You
thought
of
me
in
a
way
that
did
me
great
*NL*
honor
;
I
do
n't
know
why
you
had
taken
it
into
your
head
.
But
it
left
me
*NL*
no
loophole
for
escape
--
no
chance
to
be
the
common
,
weak
creature
I
am
.
*NL*
It
was
not
my
fault
;
I
warned
you
from
the
first
.
But
I
ought
to
have
*NL*
warned
you
more
.
I
ought
to
have
convinced
you
that
I
was
doomed
*NL*
to
disappoint
you
.
But
I
WAS
,
in
a
way
,
too
proud
.
You
see
what
my
*NL*
superiority
amounts
to
,
I
hope
!
''
she
went
on
,
raising
her
voice
with
*NL*
a
tremor
which
even
then
and
there
Newman
thought
beautiful
.
``
I
am
too
*NL*
proud
to
be
honest
,
I
am
not
too
proud
to
be
faithless
.
I
am
timid
and
*NL*
cold
and
selfish
.
I
am
afraid
of
being
uncomfortable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
call
marrying
me
uncomfortable
!
''
said
Newman
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
blushed
a
little
and
seemed
to
say
that
if
begging
his
*NL*
pardon
in
words
was
impudent
,
she
might
at
least
thus
mutely
express
*NL*
her
perfect
comprehension
of
his
finding
her
conduct
odious
.
``
It
is
not
*NL*
marrying
you
;
it
is
doing
all
that
would
go
with
it
.
It
's
the
rupture
,
*NL*
the
defiance
,
the
insisting
upon
being
happy
in
my
own
way
.
What
right
*NL*
have
I
to
be
happy
when
--
when
''
--
And
she
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
what
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
others
have
been
most
unhappy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
others
?
''
Newman
asked
.
``
What
have
you
to
do
with
any
others
but
*NL*
me
?
Besides
you
said
just
now
that
you
wanted
happiness
,
and
that
you
*NL*
should
find
it
by
obeying
your
mother
.
You
contradict
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
contradict
myself
;
that
shows
you
that
I
am
not
even
*NL*
intelligent

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
laughing
at
me
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
You
are
mocking
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
intently
,
and
an
observer
might
have
said
that
she
was
*NL*
asking
herself
whether
she
might
not
most
quickly
end
their
common
pain
*NL*
by
confessing
that
she
was
mocking
him
.
``
No
;
I
am
not
,
''
she
presently
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granting
that
you
are
not
intelligent

''
he
went
on
,
``
that
you
are
*NL*
weak
,
that
you
are
common

that
you
are
nothing
that
I
have
believed

you
were
--
what
I
ask
of
you
is
not
heroic
effort
,
it
is
a
very
common
*NL*
effort
.
There
is
a
great
deal
on
my
side
to
make
it
easy

The
simple
*NL*
truth
is
that
you
do

care
enough
about
me
to
make
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
cold

said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
I
am
as
cold
as
that
flowing
*NL*
river

*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
great
rap
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
,
and
a
long
,
grim
*NL*
laugh
.
``
Good
,
good
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
go
altogether
too
far

you
overshoot

the
mark

There

a

as
bad
as
you
would
make

yourself
out

I
see
your
game

it

what
I
said

You
are
blackening

yourself

whiten

You

it

an
outrage

I
insist

Madame

Cintre
looked
a
little
frightened

I
spoke

blindly

passionately

to
--
that
she
wanted
him
to
supplant
me
;
not
being
a
commercial
person
.
*NL*
If
he
would
make
you
an
offer
she
would
undertake
to
bring
you
over
and
*NL*
give
me
the
slip
.
Lord
Deepmere
is
n't
very
intellectual
,
so
she
had
to
*NL*
spell
it
out
to
him
.
He
said
he
admired
you
`
no
end
,
'
and
that
he
wanted
*NL*
you
to
know
it
;
but
he
did
n't
like
being
mixed
up
with
that
sort
of
*NL*
underhand
work
,
and
he
came
to
you
and
told
tales
.
That
was
about
the
*NL*
amount
of
it
,
was
n't
it
?
And
then
you
said
you
were
perfectly
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
we
should
talk
of
Lord
Deepmere
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
.
``
It
was
not
for
that
you
came
here
.
And
about
my
mother
,
it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
what
you
suspect
and
what
you
know
.
When
once
my
mind
*NL*
has
been
made
up
,
as
it
is
now
,
I
should
not
discuss
these
things
.
*NL*
Discussing
anything
,
now
,
is
very
idle
.
We
must
try
and
live
each
as
we
*NL*
can
.
I
believe
you
will
be
happy
again
;
even
,
sometimes
,
when
you
think
*NL*
of
me
.
When
you
do
so
,
think
this
--
that
it
was
not
easy
,
and
that
I
did
*NL*
the
best
I
could
.
I
have
things
to
reckon
with
that
you
do
n't
know
.
I
*NL*
mean
I
have
feelings
.
I
must
do
as
they
force
me
--
I
must
,
I
must
.
They
*NL*
would
haunt
me
otherwise
,
''
she
cried
,
with
vehemence
;
``
they
would
kill
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
your
feelings
are
:
they
are
superstitions
!
They
are
the
*NL*
feeling
that
,
after
all
,
though
I
AM
a
good
fellow
,
I
have
been
*NL*
in
business
;
the
feeling
that
your
mother
's
looks
are
law
and
your
*NL*
brother
's
words
are
gospel
;
that
you
all
hang
together
,
and
that
it
's
*NL*
a
part
of
the
everlasting
proprieties
that
they
should
have
a
hand
in
*NL*
everything
you
do
.
It
makes
my
blood
boil
.
That
is
cold
;
you
are
right
.
*NL*
And
what
I
feel
here
,
''
and
Newman
struck
his
heart
and
became
more
*NL*
poetical
than
he
knew
,
``
is
a
glowing
fire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
spectator
less
preoccupied
than
Madame
de
Cintre
's
distracted
wooer
*NL*
would
have
felt
sure
from
the
first
that
her
appealing
calm
of
manner
*NL*
was
the
result
of
violent
effort
,
in
spite
of
which
the
tide
of
*NL*
agitation
was
rapidly
rising
.
On
these
last
words
of
Newman
's
it
*NL*
overflowed
,
though
at
first
she
spoke
low
,
for
fear
of
her
voice
*NL*
betraying
her
.
``
No
.
I
was
not
right
--
I
am
not
cold
!
I
believe
that
if
I
*NL*
am
doing
what
seems
so
bad
,
it
is
not
mere
weakness
and
falseness
.
Mr.
*NL*
Newman
,
it
's
like
a
religion
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
--
I
ca
n't
!
It
's
cruel
of
*NL*
you
to
insist
.
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
n't
ask
you
to
believe
me
--
and
*NL*
pity
me
.
It
's
like
a
religion
.
There
's
a
curse
upon
the
house
;
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
--
I
do
n't
know
why
--
do
n't
ask
me
.
We
must
all
bear
it
.
I
have
*NL*
been
too
selfish
;
I
wanted
to
escape
from
it
.
You
offered
me
a
great
*NL*
chance
--
besides
my
liking
you
.
It
seemed
good
to
change
completely
,
to
*NL*
break
,
to
go
away
.
And
then
I
admired
you
.
But
I
ca
n't
--
it
has
overtaken
*NL*
and
come
back
to
me
.
''
Her
self-control
had
now
completely
abandoned
her
,
*NL*
and
her
words
were
broken
with
long
sobs
.
``
Why
do
such
dreadful
things
*NL*
happen
to
us
--
why
is
my
brother
Valentin
killed
,
like
a
beast
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
his
youth
and
his
gayety
and
his
brightness
and
all
that
we
*NL*
loved
him
for
?
Why
are
there
things
I
ca
n't
ask
about
--
that
I
am
afraid
*NL*
to
know
?
Why
are
there
places
I
ca
n't
look
at
,
sounds
I
ca
n't
hear
?
*NL*
Why
is
it
given
to
me
to
choose
,
to
decide
,
in
a
case
so
hard
and
so
*NL*
terrible
as
this
?
I
am
not
meant
for
that
--
I
am
not
made
for
boldness
*NL*
and
defiance
.
I
was
made
to
be
happy
in
a
quiet
,
natural
way
.
''
At
this
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
most
expressive
groan
,
but
Madame
de
Cintre
went
on
.
``
I
*NL*
was
made
to
do
gladly
and
gratefully
what
is
expected
of
me
.
My
mother
*NL*
has
always
been
very
good
to
me
;
that
's
all
I
can
say
.
I
must
not
judge
*NL*
her
;
I
must
not
criticize
her
.
If
I
did
,
it
would
come
back
to
me
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
change
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Newman
,
bitterly
;
``
I
must
change
--
if
I
break
in
two
in
the
*NL*
effort
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
different
.
You
are
a
man
;
you
will
get
over
it
.
You
have
all
*NL*
kinds
of
consolation
.
You
were
born
--
you
were
trained
,
to
changes
.
*NL*
Besides
--
besides
,
I
shall
always
think
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
that
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
You
are
cruel
--
you
are
terribly
*NL*
cruel
.
God
forgive
you
!
You
may
have
the
best
reasons
and
the
finest
*NL*
feelings
in
the
world
;
that
makes
no
difference
.
You
are
a
mystery
to
*NL*
me
;
I
do
n't
see
how
such
hardness
can
go
with
such
loveliness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
fixed
him
a
moment
with
her
swimming
eyes
.
``
You
believe
*NL*
I
am
hard
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
answered
her
look
,
and
then
broke
out
,
``
You
are
a
perfect
,
*NL*
faultless
creature
!
Stay
by
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
am
hard
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
Whenever
we
give
pain
we
are
hard
.
*NL*
And
we
MUST
give
pain
;
that
's
the
world
,
--
the
hateful
,
miserable
world
!
*NL*
Ah
!
''
and
she
gave
a
long
,
deep
sigh
,
``
I
ca
n't
even
say
I
am
glad
to
have
*NL*
known
you
--
though
I
am
.
That
too
is
to
wrong
you
.
I
can
say
nothing
that
*NL*
is
not
cruel
.
Therefore
let
us
part
,
without
more
of
this
.
Good-by
!
''
And
*NL*
she
put
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stood
and
looked
at
it
without
taking
it
,
and
raised
his
eyes
to
*NL*
her
face
.
He
felt
,
himself
,
like
shedding
tears
of
rage
.
``
What
are
you
*NL*
going
to
do
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
I
shall
give
no
more
pain
and
suspect
no
more
evil

I
am
going
*NL*
out
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
into
a
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
a
convent
!
''
Newman
repeated
the
words
with
the
deepest
dismay
;
*NL*
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
she
was
going
into
an
hospital
.
``
Into
a
*NL*
convent
--
YOU
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
that
it
was
not
for
my
worldly
advantage
or
pleasure
I
was
*NL*
leaving
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
Newman
hardly
understood
.
``
You
are
going
to
be
a
nun
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
``
in
a
cell
--
for
life
--
with
a
gown
and
white
veil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nun
--
a
Carmelite
nun
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
.
``
For
life
,
with
God
's
*NL*
leave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
struck
Newman
as
too
dark
and
horrible
for
belief
,
and
made
*NL*
him
feel
as
he
would
have
done
if
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
going
*NL*
to
mutilate
her
beautiful
face
,
or
drink
some
potion
that
would
make
her
*NL*
mad
.
He
clasped
his
hands
and
began
to
tremble
,
visibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
de
Cintre
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
beseech
you
!
On
my
knees
,
*NL*
if
you
like
,
I
'll
beseech
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
with
a
tender
,
pitying
,
almost
*NL*
reassuring
gesture
.
``
You
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
have
wrong
*NL*
ideas
.
It
's
nothing
horrible
.
It
is
only
peace
and
safety
.
It
is
to
be
*NL*
out
of
the
world
,
where
such
troubles
as
this
come
to
the
innocent
,
*NL*
to
the
best
.
And
for
life
--
that
's
the
blessing
of
it
!
They
ca
n't
begin
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
dropped
into
a
chair
and
sat
looking
at
her
with
a
long
,
*NL*
inarticulate
murmur
.
That
this
superb
woman
,
in
whom
he
had
seen
all
*NL*
human
grace
and
household
force
,
should
turn
from
him
and
all
the
*NL*
brightness
that
he
offered
her
--
him
and
his
future
and
his
fortune
and
*NL*
his
fidelity
--
to
muffle
herself
in
ascetic
rags
and
entomb
herself
in
a
*NL*
cell
was
a
confounding
combination
of
the
inexorable
and
the
grotesque
.
*NL*
As
the
image
deepened
before
him
the
grotesque
seemed
to
expand
and
*NL*
overspread
it
;
it
was
a
reduction
to
the
absurd
of
the
trial
to
which
*NL*
he
was
subjected
.
``
You
--
you
a
nun
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
you
with
your
beauty
*NL*
defaced
--
you
behind
locks
and
bars
!
Never
,
never
,
if
I
can
prevent
it
!
''
*NL*
And
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
a
violent
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
prevent
it
,
''
said
Madame
de
Cintre
,
``
and
it
ought
--
a
*NL*
little
--
to
satisfy
you
.
Do
you
suppose
I
will
go
on
living
in
the
world
,
*NL*
still
beside
you
,
and
yet
not
with
you
?
It
is
all
arranged
.
Good-by
,
*NL*
good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
took
her
hand
,
took
it
in
both
his
own
.
``
Forever
?
''
he
*NL*
said
.
Her
lips
made
an
inaudible
movement
and
his
own
uttered
a
deep
*NL*
imprecation
.
She
closed
her
eyes
,
as
if
with
the
pain
of
hearing
it
;
*NL*
then
he
drew
her
towards
him
and
clasped
her
to
his
breast
.
He
kissed
*NL*
her
white
face
;
for
an
instant
she
resisted
and
for
a
moment
she
*NL*
submitted
;
then
,
with
force
,
she
disengaged
herself
and
hurried
away
*NL*
over
the
long
shining
floor
.
The
next
moment
the
door
closed
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
made
his
way
out
as
he
could
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
pretty
public
walk
at
Poitiers
,
laid
out
upon
the
crest
of
*NL*
the
high
hill
around
which
the
little
city
clusters
,
planted
with
thick
*NL*
trees
and
looking
down
upon
the
fertile
fields
in
which
the
old
English
*NL*
princes
fought
for
their
right
and
held
it
.
Newman
paced
up
and
down
*NL*
this
quiet
promenade
for
the
greater
part
of
the
next
day
and
let
his
*NL*
eyes
wander
over
the
historic
prospect
;
but
he
would
have
been
sadly
*NL*
at
a
loss
to
tell
you
afterwards
whether
the
latter
was
made
up
of
*NL*
coal-fields
or
of
vineyards
.
He
was
wholly
given
up
to
his
grievance
,
*NL*
or
which
reflection
by
no
means
diminished
the
weight
.
He
feared
that
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
was
irretrievably
lost
;
and
yet
,
as
he
would
have
*NL*
said
himself
,
he
did
n't
see
his
way
clear
to
giving
her
up
.
He
found
*NL*
it
impossible
to
turn
his
back
upon
Fleurieres
and
its
inhabitants
;
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
germ
of
hope
or
reparation
must
lurk
there
*NL*
somewhere
,
if
he
could
only
stretch
his
arm
out
far
enough
to
pluck
*NL*
it
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
his
hand
on
a
door-knob
and
were
closing
his
*NL*
clenched
fist
upon
it
:
he
had
thumped
,
he
had
called
,
he
had
pressed
*NL*
the
door
with
his
powerful
knee
and
shaken
it
with
all
his
strength
,
*NL*
and
dead
,
damning
silence
had
answered
him
.
And
yet
something
held
*NL*
him
there
--
something
hardened
the
grasp
of
his
fingers
.
Newman
's
*NL*
satisfaction
had
been
too
intense
,
his
whole
plan
too
deliberate
and
*NL*
mature
,
his
prospect
of
happiness
too
rich
and
comprehensive
for
this
*NL*
fine
moral
fabric
to
crumble
at
a
stroke
.
The
very
foundation
seemed
*NL*
fatally
injured
,
and
yet
he
felt
a
stubborn
desire
still
to
try
to
save
*NL*
the
edifice
.
He
was
filled
with
a
sorer
sense
of
wrong
than
he
had
ever
*NL*
known
,
or
than
he
had
supposed
it
possible
he
should
know
.
To
accept
*NL*
his
injury
and
walk
away
without
looking
behind
him
was
a
stretch
of
*NL*
good-nature
of
which
he
found
himself
incapable
.
He
looked
behind
him
*NL*
intently
and
continually
,
and
what
he
saw
there
did
not
assuage
his
*NL*
resentment
.
He
saw
himself
trustful
,
generous
,
liberal
,
patient
,
easy
,
*NL*
pocketing
frequent
irritation
and
furnishing
unlimited
modesty
.
To
have
*NL*
eaten
humble
pie
,
to
have
been
snubbed
and
patronized
and
satirized
and
*NL*
have
consented
to
take
it
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
bargain
--
to
*NL*
have
done
this
,
and
done
it
all
for
nothing
,
surely
gave
one
a
right
to
*NL*
protest
.
And
to
be
turned
off
because
one
was
a
commercial
person
!
As
if
*NL*
he
had
ever
talked
or
dreamt
of
the
commercial
since
his
connection
with
*NL*
the
Bellegardes
began
--
as
if
he
had
made
the
least
circumstance
of
the
*NL*
commercial
--
as
if
he
would
not
have
consented
to
confound
the
commercial
*NL*
fifty
times
a
day
,
if
it
might
have
increased
by
a
hair
's
breadth
the
*NL*
chance
of
the
Bellegardes
'
not
playing
him
a
trick
!
Granted
that
being
*NL*
commercial
was
fair
ground
for
having
a
trick
played
upon
one
,
how
*NL*
little
they
knew
about
the
class
so
designed
and
its
enterprising
way
*NL*
of
not
standing
upon
trifles
!
It
was
in
the
light
of
his
injury
that
the
*NL*
weight
of
Newman
's
past
endurance
seemed
so
heavy
;
his
actual
irritation
*NL*
had
not
been
so
great
,
merged
as
it
was
in
his
vision
of
the
cloudless
*NL*
blue
that
overarched
his
immediate
wooing
.
But
now
his
sense
of
outrage
*NL*
was
deep
,
rancorous
,
and
ever
present
;
he
felt
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
*NL*
wronged
.
As
for
Madame
de
Cintre
's
conduct
,
it
struck
him
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
awe
,
and
the
fact
that
he
was
powerless
to
understand
it
or
feel
*NL*
the
reality
of
its
motives
only
deepened
the
force
with
which
he
had
*NL*
attached
himself
to
her
.
He
had
never
let
the
fact
of
her
Catholicism
*NL*
trouble
him
;
Catholicism
to
him
was
nothing
but
a
name
,
and
to
express
*NL*
a
mistrust
of
the
form
in
which
her
religious
feelings
had
moulded
*NL*
themselves
would
have
seemed
to
him
on
his
own
part
a
rather
pretentious
*NL*
affectation
of
Protestant
zeal
.
If
such
superb
white
flowers
as
that
*NL*
could
bloom
in
Catholic
soil
,
the
soil
was
not
insalubrious
.
But
it
was
*NL*
one
thing
to
be
a
Catholic
,
and
another
to
turn
nun
--
on
your
hand
!
*NL*
There
was
something
lugubriously
comical
in
the
way
Newman
's
thoroughly
*NL*
contemporaneous
optimism
was
confronted
with
this
dusky
old-world
*NL*
expedient
.
To
see
a
woman
made
for
him
and
for
motherhood
to
his
*NL*
children
juggled
away
in
this
tragic
travesty
--
it
was
a
thing
to
rub
*NL*
one
's
eyes
over
,
a
nightmare
,
an
illusion
,
a
hoax
.
But
the
hours
passed
*NL*
away
without
disproving
the
thing
,
and
leaving
him
only
the
after-sense
*NL*
of
the
vehemence
with
which
he
had
embraced
Madame
de
Cintre
.
He
*NL*
remembered
her
words
and
her
looks
;
he
turned
them
over
and
tried
to
*NL*
shake
the
mystery
out
of
them
and
to
infuse
them
with
an
endurable
*NL*
meaning
.
What
had
she
meant
by
her
feeling
being
a
kind
of
religion
?
It
*NL*
was
the
religion
simply
of
the
family
laws
,
the
religion
of
which
her
*NL*
implacable
little
mother
was
the
high
priestess
.
Twist
the
thing
about
*NL*
as
her
generosity
would
,
the
one
certain
fact
was
that
they
had
used
*NL*
force
against
her
.
Her
generosity
had
tried
to
screen
them
,
but
Newman
's
*NL*
heart
rose
into
his
throat
at
the
thought
that
they
should
go
scot-free
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twenty-four
hours
wore
themselves
away
,
and
the
next
morning
Newman
*NL*
sprang
to
his
feet
with
the
resolution
to
return
to
Fleurieres
and
*NL*
demand
another
interview
with
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
.
He
*NL*
lost
no
time
in
putting
it
into
practice
.
As
he
rolled
swiftly
over
*NL*
the
excellent
road
in
the
little
caleche
furnished
him
at
the
inn
at
*NL*
Poitiers
,
he
drew
forth
,
as
it
were
,
from
the
very
safe
place
in
his
*NL*
mind
to
which
he
had
consigned
it
,
the
last
information
given
him
by
*NL*
poor
Valentin
.
Valentin
had
told
him
he
could
do
something
with
it
,
and
*NL*
Newman
thought
it
would
be
well
to
have
it
at
hand
.
This
was
of
course
*NL*
not
the
first
time
,
lately
,
that
Newman
had
given
it
his
attention
.
It
*NL*
was
information
in
the
rough
,
--
it
was
dark
and
puzzling
;
but
Newman
was
*NL*
neither
helpless
nor
afraid
.
Valentin
had
evidently
meant
to
put
him
in
*NL*
possession
of
a
powerful
instrument
,
though
he
could
not
be
said
to
*NL*
have
placed
the
handle
very
securely
within
his
grasp
.
But
if
he
had
not
*NL*
really
told
him
the
secret
,
he
had
at
least
given
him
the
clew
to
it
--
a
*NL*
clew
of
which
that
queer
old
Mrs.
Bread
held
the
other
end
.
Mrs.
Bread
*NL*
had
always
looked
to
Newman
as
if
she
knew
secrets
;
and
as
he
apparently
*NL*
enjoyed
her
esteem
,
he
suspected
she
might
be
induced
to
share
her
*NL*
knowledge
with
him
.
So
long
as
there
was
only
Mrs.
Bread
to
deal
*NL*
with
,
he
felt
easy
.
As
to
what
there
was
to
find
out
,
he
had
only
one
*NL*
fear
--
that
it
might
not
be
bad
enough
.
Then
,
when
the
image
of
the
*NL*
marquise
and
her
son
rose
before
him
again
,
standing
side
by
side
,
*NL*
the
old
woman
's
hand
in
Urbain
's
arm
,
and
the
same
cold
,
unsociable
*NL*
fixedness
in
the
eyes
of
each
,
he
cried
out
to
himself
that
the
fear
was
*NL*
groundless
.
There
was
blood
in
the
secret
at
the
very
last
!
He
arrived
*NL*
at
Fleurieres
almost
in
a
state
of
elation
;
he
had
satisfied
himself
,
*NL*
logically
,
that
in
the
presence
of
his
threat
of
exposure
they
would
,
as
*NL*
he
mentally
phrased
it
,
rattle
down
like
unwound
buckets
.
He
remembered
*NL*
indeed
that
he
must
first
catch
his
hare
--
first
ascertain
what
there
was
*NL*
to
expose
;
but
after
that
,
why
should
n't
his
happiness
be
as
good
as
new
*NL*
again
?
Mother
and
son
would
drop
their
lovely
victim
in
terror
and
take
*NL*
to
hiding
,
and
Madame
de
Cintre
,
left
to
herself
,
would
surely
come
back
*NL*
to
him
.
Give
her
a
chance
and
she
would
rise
to
the
surface
,
return
to
*NL*
the
light
.
How
could
she
fail
to
perceive
that
his
house
would
be
much
*NL*
the
most
comfortable
sort
of
convent
?
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
left
his
conveyance
at
the
inn
and
walked
*NL*
the
short
remaining
distance
to
the
chateau
.
When
he
reached
the
gate
,
*NL*
however
,
a
singular
feeling
took
possession
of
him
--
a
feeling
which
,
*NL*
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
had
its
source
in
its
unfathomable
good
*NL*
nature
.
He
stood
there
a
while
,
looking
through
the
bars
at
the
large
,
*NL*
time-stained
face
of
the
edifice
,
and
wondering
to
what
crime
it
was
*NL*
that
the
dark
old
house
,
with
its
flowery
name
,
had
given
convenient
*NL*
occasion
.
It
had
given
occasion
,
first
and
last
,
to
tyrannies
and
*NL*
sufferings
enough
,
Newman
said
to
himself
;
it
was
an
evil-looking
*NL*
place
to
live
in
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
came
the
reflection
--
What
a
horrible
*NL*
rubbish-heap
of
iniquity
to
fumble
in
!
The
attitude
of
inquisitor
turned
*NL*
its
ignobler
face
,
and
with
the
same
movement
Newman
declared
that
*NL*
the
Bellegardes
should
have
another
chance
.
He
would
appeal
once
more
*NL*
directly
to
their
sense
of
fairness
,
and
not
to
their
fear
,
and
if
they
*NL*
should
be
accessible
to
reason
,
he
need
know
nothing
worse
about
them
*NL*
than
what
he
already
knew
.
That
was
bad
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gate-keeper
let
him
in
through
the
same
stiff
crevice
as
before
,
*NL*
and
he
passed
through
the
court
and
over
the
little
rustic
bridge
on
the
*NL*
moat
.
The
door
was
opened
before
he
had
reached
it
,
and
,
as
if
to
put
*NL*
his
clemency
to
rout
with
the
suggestion
of
a
richer
opportunity
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
stood
there
awaiting
him
.
Her
face
,
as
usual
,
looked
as
hopelessly
*NL*
blank
as
the
tide-smoothed
sea-sand
,
and
her
black
garments
seemed
of
*NL*
an
intenser
sable
.
Newman
had
already
learned
that
her
strange
*NL*
inexpressiveness
could
be
a
vehicle
for
emotion
,
and
he
was
not
*NL*
surprised
at
the
muffled
vivacity
with
which
she
whispered
,
``
I
thought
*NL*
you
would
try
again
,
sir
.
I
was
looking
out
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
I
think
you
are
my
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
looked
at
him
opaquely
.
``
I
wish
you
well
sir
;
but
it
's
vain
*NL*
wishing
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
then
,
how
they
have
treated
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
dryly
,
``
I
know
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
Everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
gave
him
a
glance
somewhat
more
lucent
.
``
I
know
at
least
too
*NL*
much
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
never
know
too
much
.
I
congratulate
you
.
I
have
come
to
see
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
,
''
Newman
added
.
``
Are
they
at
home
?
If
*NL*
they
are
not
,
I
will
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lady
is
always
at
home
,
''
Mrs.
Bread
replied
,
``
and
the
marquis
is
*NL*
mostly
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
then
tell
them
--
one
or
the
other
,
or
both
--
that
I
am
here
and
*NL*
that
I
desire
to
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
hesitated
.
``
May
I
take
a
great
liberty
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
taken
a
liberty
but
you
have
justified
it
,
''
said
Newman
,
*NL*
with
diplomatic
urbanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
dropped
her
wrinkled
eyelids
as
if
she
were
curtseying
;
but
*NL*
the
curtsey
stopped
there
;
the
occasion
was
too
grave
.
``
You
have
come
to
*NL*
plead
with
them
again
,
sir
?
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
this
--
that
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
returned
this
morning
to
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
's
gone
!
''
And
Newman
,
groaning
,
smote
the
pavement
with
his
*NL*
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
gone
straight
to
the
convent
--
the
Carmelites
they
call
it
.
I
*NL*
see
you
know
,
sir
.
My
lady
and
the
marquis
take
it
very
ill
.
It
was
only
*NL*
last
night
she
told
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
had
kept
it
back
,
then
?
''
cried
Newman
.
``
Good
,
good
!
And
they
*NL*
are
very
fierce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
pleased
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
But
they
may
well
dislike
it
.
*NL*
They
tell
me
it
's
most
dreadful
,
sir
;
of
all
the
nuns
in
Christendom
the
*NL*
Carmelites
are
the
worst
.
You
may
say
they
are
really
not
human
,
sir
;
*NL*
they
make
you
give
up
everything
--
forever
.
And
to
think
of
HER
there
!
If
*NL*
I
was
one
that
cried
,
sir
,
I
could
cry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
her
an
instant
.
``
We
must
n't
cry
,
Mrs.
Bread
;
we
must
*NL*
act
.
Go
and
call
them
!
''
And
he
made
a
movement
to
enter
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Bread
gently
checked
him
.
``
May
I
take
another
liberty
?
I
am
*NL*
told
you
were
with
my
dearest
Mr.
Valentin
,
in
his
last
hours
.
If
you
*NL*
would
tell
me
a
word
about
him
!
The
poor
count
was
my
own
boy
,
sir
;
for
*NL*
the
first
year
of
his
life
he
was
hardly
out
of
my
arms
;
I
taught
him
*NL*
to
speak
.
And
the
count
spoke
so
well
,
sir
!
He
always
spoke
well
to
his
*NL*
poor
old
Bread
.
When
he
grew
up
and
took
his
pleasure
he
always
had
a
*NL*
kind
word
for
me
.
And
to
die
in
that
wild
way
!
They
have
a
story
that
*NL*
he
fought
with
a
wine-merchant
.
I
ca
n't
believe
that
,
sir
!
And
was
he
in
*NL*
great
pain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
wise
,
kind
old
woman
,
Mrs.
Bread
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
hoped
I
*NL*
might
see
you
with
my
own
children
in
your
arms
.
Perhaps
I
shall
,
yet
.
''
*NL*
And
he
put
out
his
hand
.
Mrs.
Bread
looked
for
a
moment
at
his
open
*NL*
palm
,
and
then
,
as
if
fascinated
by
the
novelty
of
the
gesture
,
extended
*NL*
her
own
ladylike
fingers
.
Newman
held
her
hand
firmly
and
deliberately
,
*NL*
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
.
``
You
want
to
know
all
about
Mr.
Valentin
?
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
sad
pleasure
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
tell
you
everything
.
Can
you
sometimes
leave
this
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
chateau
,
sir
?
I
really
do
n't
know
.
I
never
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
,
then
;
try
hard
.
Try
this
evening
,
at
dusk
.
Come
to
me
in
the
old
*NL*
ruin
there
on
the
hill
,
in
the
court
before
the
church
.
I
will
wait
for
*NL*
you
there
;
I
have
something
very
important
to
tell
you
.
An
old
woman
*NL*
like
you
can
do
as
she
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
stared
,
wondering
,
with
parted
lips
.
``
Is
it
from
the
count
,
*NL*
sir
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
count
--
from
his
death-bed
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
,
then
.
I
will
be
bold
,
for
once
,
for
HIM
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
Newman
into
the
great
drawing-room
with
which
he
had
already
*NL*
made
acquaintance
,
and
retired
to
execute
his
commands
.
Newman
waited
*NL*
a
long
time
;
at
last
he
was
on
the
point
of
ringing
and
repeating
his
*NL*
request
.
He
was
looking
round
him
for
a
bell
when
the
marquis
came
in
*NL*
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
.
It
will
be
seen
that
Newman
had
a
logical
*NL*
mind
when
I
say
that
he
declared
to
himself
,
in
perfect
good
faith
,
as
*NL*
a
result
of
Valentin
's
dark
hints
,
that
his
adversaries
looked
grossly
*NL*
wicked
.
``
There
is
no
mistake
about
it
now
,
''
he
said
to
himself
as
they
*NL*
advanced
.
``
They
're
a
bad
lot
;
they
have
pulled
off
the
mask
.
''
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
certainly
bore
in
their
faces
the
signs
of
*NL*
extreme
perturbation
;
they
looked
like
people
who
had
passed
a
sleepless
*NL*
night
.
Confronted
,
moreover
,
with
an
annoyance
which
they
hoped
they
had
*NL*
disposed
of
,
it
was
not
natural
that
they
should
have
any
very
tender
*NL*
glances
to
bestow
upon
Newman
.
He
stood
before
them
,
and
such
eye-beams
*NL*
as
they
found
available
they
leveled
at
him
;
Newman
feeling
as
if
the
*NL*
door
of
a
sepulchre
had
suddenly
been
opened
,
and
the
damp
darkness
were
*NL*
being
exhaled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
have
come
back
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
come
to
try
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
ridiculous
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
``
to
pretend
that
we
are
*NL*
glad
to
see
you
or
that
we
do
n't
question
the
taste
of
your
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
talk
about
taste
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
a
laugh
,
``
or
that
will
*NL*
bring
us
round
to
yours
!
If
I
consulted
my
taste
I
certainly
should
n't
*NL*
come
to
see
you
.
Besides
,
I
will
make
as
short
work
as
you
please
.
*NL*
Promise
me
to
raise
the
blockade
--
to
set
Madame
de
Cintre
at
*NL*
liberty
--
and
I
will
retire
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
hesitated
as
to
whether
we
would
see
you
,
''
said
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
;
``
and
we
were
on
the
point
of
declining
the
honor
.
But
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
that
we
should
act
with
civility
,
as
we
have
always
done
,
*NL*
and
I
wished
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
informing
you
that
there
are
*NL*
certain
weaknesses
that
people
of
our
way
of
feeling
can
be
guilty
of
*NL*
but
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
weak
but
once
,
but
you
will
be
audacious
many
times
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
Newman
answered
.
``
I
did
n't
come
however
,
for
conversational
*NL*
purposes
.
I
came
to
say
this
,
simply
:
that
if
you
will
write
immediately
*NL*
to
your
daughter
that
you
withdraw
your
opposition
to
her
marriage
,
I
*NL*
will
take
care
of
the
rest
.
You
do
n't
want
her
to
turn
nun
--
you
know
*NL*
more
about
the
horrors
of
it
than
I
do
.
Marrying
a
commercial
person
is
*NL*
better
than
that
.
Give
me
a
letter
to
her
,
signed
and
sealed
,
saying
you
*NL*
retract
and
that
she
may
marry
me
with
your
blessing
,
and
I
will
take
*NL*
it
to
her
at
the
convent
and
bring
her
out
.
There
's
your
chance
--
I
call
*NL*
those
easy
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
look
at
the
matter
otherwise
,
you
know
.
We
call
them
very
hard
*NL*
terms
,
''
said
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
.
They
had
all
remained
standing
*NL*
rigidly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
``
I
think
my
mother
will
tell
you
that
*NL*
she
would
rather
her
daughter
should
become
Soeur
Catherine
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Newman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
lady
,
with
the
serenity
of
supreme
power
,
let
her
son
make
*NL*
her
epigrams
for
her
.
She
only
smiled
,
almost
sweetly
,
shaking
her
head
*NL*
and
repeating
,
``
But
once
,
Mr.
Newman
;
but
once
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
that
Newman
had
ever
seen
or
heard
gave
him
such
a
sense
of
*NL*
marble
hardness
as
this
movement
and
the
tone
that
accompanied
it
.
*NL*
``
Could
anything
compel
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Do
you
know
of
anything
that
*NL*
would
force
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
language
,
sir
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
``
addressed
to
people
in
*NL*
bereavement
and
grief
is
beyond
all
qualification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
most
cases
,
''
Newman
answered
,
``
your
objection
would
have
some
*NL*
weight
,
even
admitting
that
Madame
de
Cintre
's
present
intentions
make
*NL*
time
precious
.
But
I
have
thought
of
what
you
speak
of
,
and
I
have
come
*NL*
here
to-day
without
scruple
simply
because
I
consider
your
brother
and
*NL*
you
two
very
different
parties
.
I
see
no
connection
between
you
.
Your
*NL*
brother
was
ashamed
of
you
.
Lying
there
wounded
and
dying
,
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
apologized
to
me
for
your
conduct
.
He
apologized
to
me
for
that
*NL*
of
his
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
the
effect
of
these
words
was
as
if
Newman
had
struck
*NL*
a
physical
blow
.
A
quick
flush
leaped
into
the
faces
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
and
her
son
,
and
they
exchanged
a
glance
like
a
twinkle
of
*NL*
steel
.
Urbain
uttered
two
words
which
Newman
but
half
heard
,
but
of
*NL*
which
the
sense
came
to
him
as
it
were
in
the
reverberation
of
the
*NL*
sound
,
``
Le
miserable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
show
little
respect
for
the
living
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
*NL*
``
but
at
least
respect
the
dead
.
Do
n't
profane
--
do
n't
insult
--
the
memory
*NL*
of
my
innocent
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak
the
simple
truth
,
''
Newman
declared
,
``
and
I
speak
it
for
a
*NL*
purpose
.
I
repeat
it
--
distinctly
.
Your
son
was
utterly
disgusted
--
your
*NL*
son
apologized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
was
frowning
portentously
,
and
Newman
supposed
he
*NL*
was
frowning
at
poor
Valentin
's
invidious
image
.
Taken
by
surprise
,
*NL*
his
scant
affection
for
his
brother
had
made
a
momentary
concession
to
*NL*
dishonor
.
But
not
for
an
appreciable
instant
did
his
mother
lower
her
*NL*
flag
.
``
You
are
immensely
mistaken
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
``
My
son
was
sometimes
*NL*
light
,
but
he
was
never
indecent
.
He
died
faithful
to
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
simply
misunderstood
him
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
beginning
to
rally
.
*NL*
``
You
affirm
the
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
for
poor
Valentin
's
apology
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
was
*NL*
far
more
painful
than
pleasant
to
me
.
This
atrocious
thing
was
not
his
*NL*
fault
;
he
never
hurt
me
,
or
any
one
else
;
he
was
the
soul
of
honor
.
But
*NL*
it
shows
how
he
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
to
prove
that
my
poor
brother
,
in
his
last
moments
,
was
*NL*
out
of
his
head
,
we
can
only
say
that
under
the
melancholy
circumstances
*NL*
nothing
was
more
possible
.
But
confine
yourself
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
quite
in
his
right
mind
,
''
said
Newman
,
with
gentle
but
dangerous
*NL*
doggedness
;
``
I
have
never
seen
him
so
bright
and
clever
.
It
was
terrible
*NL*
to
see
that
witty
,
capable
fellow
dying
such
a
death
.
You
know
I
was
*NL*
very
fond
of
your
brother
.
And
I
have
further
proof
of
his
sanity
,
''
*NL*
Newman
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
gathered
herself
together
majestically
.
``
This
is
too
*NL*
gross
!
''
she
cried
.
``
We
decline
to
accept
your
story
,
sir
--
we
repudiate
*NL*
it
.
Urbain
,
open
the
door
.
''
She
turned
away
,
with
an
imperious
motion
*NL*
to
her
son
,
and
passed
rapidly
down
the
length
of
the
room
.
The
marquis
*NL*
went
with
her
and
held
the
door
open
.
Newman
was
left
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
his
finger
,
as
a
sign
to
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
who
closed
the
*NL*
door
behind
his
mother
and
stood
waiting
.
Newman
slowly
advanced
,
more
*NL*
silent
,
for
the
moment
,
than
life
.
The
two
men
stood
face
to
face
.
Then
*NL*
Newman
had
a
singular
sensation
;
he
felt
his
sense
of
injury
almost
*NL*
brimming
over
into
jocularity
.
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
do
n't
treat
me
*NL*
well
;
at
least
admit
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
*NL*
delicate
,
best-bred
voice
,
``
I
detest
you
,
personally
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
I
feel
to
you
,
but
for
politeness
sake
I
do
n't
say
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
's
singular
I
should
want
so
much
to
be
your
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
but
I
ca
n't
give
it
up
.
Let
me
try
once
more
.
''
And
he
*NL*
paused
a
moment
.
``
You
have
a
secret
--
you
have
a
skeleton
in
the
closet
.
''
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
continued
to
look
at
him
hard
,
but
Newman
could
not
see
*NL*
whether
his
eyes
betrayed
anything
;
the
look
of
his
eyes
was
always
so
*NL*
strange
.
Newman
paused
again
,
and
then
went
on
.
``
You
and
your
mother
*NL*
have
committed
a
crime
.
''
At
this
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
eyes
certainly
did
*NL*
change
;
they
seemed
to
flicker
,
like
blown
candles
.
Newman
could
see
*NL*
that
he
was
profoundly
startled
;
but
there
was
something
admirable
in
*NL*
his
self-control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Continue
,
''
said
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
lifted
a
finger
and
made
it
waver
a
little
in
the
air
.
``
Need
I
*NL*
continue
?
You
are
trembling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
where
did
you
obtain
this
interesting
information
?
''
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
asked
,
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
strictly
accurate
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
know
*NL*
more
than
I
do
.
At
present
that
is
all
I
know
.
You
have
done
something
*NL*
that
you
must
hide
,
something
that
would
damn
you
if
it
were
known
,
*NL*
something
that
would
disgrace
the
name
you
are
so
proud
of
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
it
is
,
but
I
can
find
out
.
Persist
in
your
present
course
and
I
*NL*
WILL
find
out
.
Change
it
,
let
your
sister
go
in
peace
,
and
I
will
leave
*NL*
you
alone
.
It
's
a
bargain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
almost
succeeded
in
looking
untroubled
;
the
breaking
up
*NL*
of
the
ice
in
his
handsome
countenance
was
an
operation
that
was
*NL*
necessarily
gradual
.
But
Newman
's
mildly-syllabled
argumentation
seemed
*NL*
to
press
,
and
press
,
and
presently
he
averted
his
eyes
.
He
stood
some
*NL*
moments
,
reflecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
told
you
this
,
''
he
said
,
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
hesitated
a
moment
.
``
Yes
,
your
brother
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
smiled
,
handsomely
.
``
Did
n't
I
say
that
he
was
out
of
his
*NL*
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
out
of
his
mind
if
I
do
n't
find
out
.
He
was
very
much
in
it
if
I
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
gave
a
shrug
.
``
Eh
,
sir
,
find
out
or
not
,
as
you
*NL*
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
frighten
you
?
''
demanded
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
you
to
judge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
for
you
to
judge
,
at
your
leisure
.
Think
it
over
,
feel
*NL*
yourself
all
round
.
I
will
give
you
an
hour
or
two
.
I
ca
n't
give
you
*NL*
more
,
for
how
do
we
know
how
fast
they
may
be
making
Madame
de
Cintre
*NL*
a
nun
?
Talk
it
over
with
your
mother
;
let
her
judge
whether
she
is
*NL*
frightened
.
I
do
n't
believe
she
is
as
easily
frightened
,
in
general
,
as
*NL*
you
;
but
you
will
see
.
I
will
go
and
wait
in
the
village
,
at
the
inn
,
*NL*
and
I
beg
you
to
let
me
know
as
soon
as
possible
.
Say
by
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
A
simple
YES
or
NO
on
paper
will
do
.
Only
,
you
know
,
in
case
of
a
yes
*NL*
I
shall
expect
you
,
this
time
,
to
stick
to
your
bargain
.
''
And
with
this
*NL*
Newman
opened
the
door
and
let
himself
out
.
The
marquis
did
not
move
,
*NL*
and
Newman
,
retiring
,
gave
him
another
look
.
``
At
the
inn
,
in
the
*NL*
village
,
''
he
repeated
.
Then
he
turned
away
altogether
and
passed
out
of
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
extremely
excited
by
what
he
had
been
doing
,
for
it
was
*NL*
inevitable
that
there
should
be
a
certain
emotion
in
calling
up
the
*NL*
spectre
of
dishonor
before
a
family
a
thousand
years
old
.
But
he
went
*NL*
back
to
the
inn
and
contrived
to
wait
there
,
deliberately
,
for
the
next
*NL*
two
hours
.
He
thought
it
more
than
probable
that
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
would
give
no
sign
;
for
an
answer
to
his
challenge
,
in
either
sense
,
*NL*
would
be
a
confession
of
guilt
.
What
he
most
expected
was
silence
--
in
*NL*
other
words
defiance
.
But
he
prayed
that
,
as
he
imagined
it
,
his
shot
*NL*
might
bring
them
down
.
It
did
bring
,
by
three
o'clock
,
a
note
,
delivered
*NL*
by
a
footman
;
a
note
addressed
in
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
's
handsome
*NL*
English
hand
.
It
ran
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
deny
myself
the
satisfaction
of
letting
you
know
that
I
return
*NL*
to
Paris
,
to-morrow
,
with
my
mother
,
in
order
that
we
may
see
my
sister
*NL*
and
confirm
her
in
the
resolution
which
is
the
most
effectual
reply
to
*NL*
your
audacious
pertinacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
HENRI-URBAIN
DE
BELLEGARDE

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
,
and
continued
his
walk
up
and
*NL*
down
the
inn-parlor
.
He
had
spent
most
of
his
time
,
for
the
past
week
,
*NL*
in
walking
up
and
down
.
He
continued
to
measure
the
length
of
the
little
*NL*
salle
of
the
Armes
de
Prance
until
the
day
began
to
wane
,
when
he
went
*NL*
out
to
keep
his
rendezvous
with
Mrs.
Bread
.
The
path
which
led
up
*NL*
the
hill
to
the
ruin
was
easy
to
find
,
and
Newman
in
a
short
time
had
*NL*
followed
it
to
the
top
.
He
passed
beneath
the
rugged
arch
of
the
castle
*NL*
wall
,
and
looked
about
him
in
the
early
dusk
for
an
old
woman
in
black
.
*NL*
The
castle
yard
was
empty
,
but
the
door
of
the
church
was
open
.
Newman
*NL*
went
into
the
little
nave
and
of
course
found
a
deeper
dusk
than
*NL*
without
.
A
couple
of
tapers
,
however
,
twinkled
on
the
altar
and
just
*NL*
enabled
him
to
perceive
a
figure
seated
by
one
of
the
pillars
.
Closer
*NL*
inspection
helped
him
to
recognize
Mrs.
Bread
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
was
dressed
with
unwonted
splendor
.
She
wore
a
large
black
*NL*
silk
bonnet
,
with
imposing
bows
of
crape
,
and
an
old
black
satin
dress
*NL*
disposed
itself
in
vaguely
lustrous
folds
about
her
person
.
She
had
*NL*
judged
it
proper
to
the
occasion
to
appear
in
her
stateliest
apparel
.
*NL*
She
had
been
sitting
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
but
when
*NL*
Newman
passed
before
her
she
looked
up
at
him
,
and
then
she
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
Catholic
,
Mrs.
Bread
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
I
'm
a
good
Church-of-England
woman
,
very
Low
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
I
should
be
safer
in
here
than
outside
.
I
was
never
out
*NL*
in
the
evening
before
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
be
safer
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
where
no
one
can
hear
us
.
''
And
he
led
*NL*
the
way
back
into
the
castle
court
and
then
followed
a
path
beside
the
*NL*
church
,
which
he
was
sure
must
lead
into
another
part
of
the
ruin
.
He
*NL*
was
not
deceived
.
It
wandered
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
terminated
*NL*
before
a
fragment
of
wall
pierced
by
a
rough
aperture
which
had
once
*NL*
been
a
door
.
Through
this
aperture
Newman
passed
and
found
himself
in
*NL*
a
nook
peculiarly
favorable
to
quiet
conversation
,
as
probably
many
*NL*
an
earnest
couple
,
otherwise
assorted
than
our
friends
,
had
assured
*NL*
themselves
.
The
hill
sloped
abruptly
away
,
and
on
the
remnant
of
its
*NL*
crest
were
scattered
two
or
three
fragments
of
stone
.
Beneath
,
over
the
*NL*
plain
,
lay
the
gathered
twilight
,
through
which
,
in
the
near
distance
,
*NL*
gleamed
two
or
three
lights
from
the
chateau
.
Mrs.
Bread
rustled
slowly
*NL*
after
her
guide
,
and
Newman
,
satisfying
himself
that
one
of
the
fallen
*NL*
stones
was
steady
,
proposed
to
her
to
sit
upon
it
.
She
cautiously
*NL*
complied
,
and
he
placed
himself
upon
another
,
near
her
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
,
''
Newman
said
.
``
I
hope
it
wo
n't
*NL*
get
you
into
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
be
missed
.
My
lady
,
in
these
days
,
is
not
fond
of
*NL*
having
me
about
her
.
''
This
was
said
with
a
certain
fluttered
eagerness
*NL*
which
increased
Newman
's
sense
of
having
inspired
the
old
woman
with
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
first
,
you
know
,
''
he
answered
,
``
you
took
an
interest
in
my
*NL*
prospects
.
You
were
on
my
side
.
That
gratified
me
,
I
assure
you
.
And
now
*NL*
that
you
know
what
they
have
done
to
me
,
I
am
sure
you
are
with
me
all
*NL*
the
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
not
done
well
--
I
must
say
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
But
you
*NL*
must
n't
blame
the
poor
countess
;
they
pressed
her
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
give
a
million
of
dollars
to
know
what
they
did
to
her
!
''
cried
*NL*
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
sat
with
a
dull
,
oblique
gaze
fixed
upon
the
lights
of
the
*NL*
chateau
.
``
They
worked
on
her
feelings
;
they
knew
that
was
the
way
.
*NL*
She
is
a
delicate
creature
.
They
made
her
feel
wicked
.
She
is
only
too
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
they
made
her
feel
wicked
,
''
said
Newman
,
slowly
;
and
then
he
*NL*
repeated
it
.
``
They
made
her
feel
wicked
,
--
they
made
her
feel
wicked
.
''
*NL*
The
words
seemed
to
him
for
the
moment
a
vivid
description
of
infernal
*NL*
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
because
she
was
so
good
that
she
gave
up
--
poor
sweet
lady
!
''
*NL*
added
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
was
better
to
them
than
to
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
afraid
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
very
confidently
;
``
she
has
always
*NL*
been
afraid
,
or
at
least
for
a
long
time
.
That
was
the
real
trouble
,
*NL*
sir
.
She
was
like
a
fair
peach
,
I
may
say
,
with
just
one
little
speck
.
*NL*
She
had
one
little
sad
spot
.
You
pushed
her
into
the
sunshine
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
it
almost
disappeared
.
Then
they
pulled
her
back
into
the
shade
and
in
*NL*
a
moment
it
began
to
spread
.
Before
we
knew
it
she
was
gone
.
She
was
a
*NL*
delicate
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
singular
attestation
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
delicacy
,
for
all
its
*NL*
singularity
,
set
Newman
's
wound
aching
afresh
.
``
I
see
,
''
he
presently
*NL*
said
;
``
she
knew
something
bad
about
her
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
she
knew
nothing
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
holding
her
head
very
*NL*
stiff
and
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
glimmering
windows
of
the
*NL*
chateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
guessed
something
,
then
,
or
suspected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
afraid
to
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
YOU
know
,
at
any
rate
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slowly
turned
her
vague
eyes
upon
Newman
,
squeezing
her
hands
*NL*
together
in
her
lap
.
``
You
are
not
quite
faithful
,
sir
.
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
to
tell
me
about
Mr.
Valentin
you
asked
me
to
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
more
we
talk
of
Mr.
Valentin
the
better
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
That
's
*NL*
exactly
what
I
want
.
I
was
with
him
,
as
I
told
you
,
in
his
last
hour
.
*NL*
He
was
in
a
great
deal
of
pain
,
but
he
was
quite
himself
.
You
know
what
*NL*
that
means
;
he
was
bright
and
lively
and
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
would
always
be
clever
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
And
did
he
know
*NL*
of
your
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
guessed
it
of
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
say
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
it
was
a
disgrace
to
his
name
--
but
it
was
not
the
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
Lord
!
''
murmured
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
that
his
mother
and
his
brother
had
once
put
their
heads
*NL*
together
and
invented
something
even
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
listened
to
that
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
But
I
DID
listen
,
and
I
do
n't
forget
it

Now
I
want
to
*NL*
know
what
it
is
they
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
gave
a
soft
moan
.
``
And
you
have
enticed
me
up
into
this
*NL*
strange
place
to
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
wo
n't
say
a
word
that
shall
be
*NL*
disagreeable
to
you

Tell
me
as
it
suits
you

and
when
it
suits
you

*NL*
Only
remember
that
it
was
Mr.
Valentin
's
last
wish
that
you
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
say
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
it
with
his
last
breath

Tell
Mrs.
Bread
I
told
you
to
ask
*NL*
her

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
he
tell
you
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
too
long
a
story
for
a
dying
man
;
he
had
no
breath
left
in
his
*NL*
body

He
could
only
say
that
he
wanted
me
to
know

that

wronged
as
I
*NL*
was
,
it
was
my
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
will
it
help
you

said
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
me
to
decide

Mr.

believed
it
would

why

told
me

Your
name

almost
the

spoke

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.

was
evidently
awe-struck
by
this
statement

she
shook
her
*NL*
clasped
hands
slowly
up
and
down
.
``
Excuse
me

a

There

said
Mrs.

with

a
mild
head-shake

I
suspect

Newman
propounded
;
``
he
made

What

I

Mrs.

seemed
to
hold
her
breath

howling

*NL*
*NL*
This
passionate
sally

Newman
uttered
with
the
greater
fervor
that
*NL*
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
had
a
chance
to
say
all
this
aloud
,
kindled
*NL*
two
small
sparks
in
Mrs.

's
fixed
eyes
.
``
I
suppose
you
have
a
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame

Mrs.

*NL*
``
Surely

said
Mrs.

apparently
impressed
by
the
ingenuity

this
*NL*
reflection

She
was
silent
for
some
moments

she
added

laugh

You
shall
come
and
live
with
me
.
You
shall
*NL*
be
my
housekeeper
,
or
anything
you
like
.
I
will
pension
you
for
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
,
sir
,
you
think
of
everything
.
''
And
she
seemed
to
fall
*NL*
a-brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
watched
her
a
while
,
and
then
he
said
suddenly
.
``
Ah
,
Mrs.
Bread
,
*NL*
you
are
too
fond
of
my
lady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
as
quickly
.
``
I
would
n't
have
you
say
that
,
sir
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
it
any
part
of
my
duty
to
be
fond
of
my
lady
.
I
have
served
*NL*
her
faithfully
this
many
a
year
;
but
if
she
were
to
die
to-morrow
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
before
Heaven
I
should
n't
shed
a
tear
for
her
.
''
Then
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
,
``
I
have
no
reason
to
love
her
!
''
Mrs.
Bread
added
.
``
The
most
she
*NL*
has
done
for
me
has
been
not
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
.
''
Newman
felt
*NL*
that
decidedly
his
companion
was
more
and
more
confidential
--
that
if
*NL*
luxury
is
corrupting
,
Mrs.
Bread
's
conservative
habits
were
already
*NL*
relaxed
by
the
spiritual
comfort
of
this
preconcerted
interview
,
in
*NL*
a
remarkable
locality
,
with
a
free-spoken
millionaire
.
All
his
native
*NL*
shrewdness
admonished
him
that
his
part
was
simply
to
let
her
take
her
*NL*
time
--
let
the
charm
of
the
occasion
work
.
So
he
said
nothing
;
he
only
*NL*
looked
at
her
kindly
.
Mrs.
Bread
sat
nursing
her
lean
elbows
.
``
My
lady
*NL*
once
did
me
a
great
wrong
,
''
she
went
on
at
last
.
``
She
has
a
terrible
*NL*
tongue
when
she
is
vexed
.
It
was
many
a
year
ago
,
but
I
have
never
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
I
have
never
mentioned
it
to
a
human
creature
;
I
have
kept
*NL*
my
grudge
to
myself
.
I
dare
say
I
have
been
wicked
,
but
my
grudge
has
*NL*
grown
old
with
me
.
It
has
grown
good
for
nothing
,
too
,
I
dare
say
;
*NL*
but
it
has
lived
along
,
as
I
have
lived
.
It
will
die
when
I
die
,
--
not
*NL*
before
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
IS
your
grudge
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
dropped
her
eyes
and
hesitated
.
``
If
I
were
a
foreigner
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
should
make
less
of
telling
you
;
it
comes
harder
to
a
decent
*NL*
Englishwoman
.
But
I
sometimes
think
I
have
picked
up
too
many
foreign
*NL*
ways
.
What
I
was
telling
you
belongs
to
a
time
when
I
was
much
younger
*NL*
and
very
different
looking
to
what
I
am
now
.
I
had
a
very
high
color
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
you
can
believe
it
,
indeed
I
was
a
very
smart
lass
.
My
lady
was
*NL*
younger
,
too
,
and
the
late
marquis
was
youngest
of
all
--
I
mean
in
the
*NL*
way
he
went
on
,
sir
;
he
had
a
very
high
spirit
;
he
was
a
magnificent
*NL*
man
.
He
was
fond
of
his
pleasure
,
like
most
foreigners
,
and
it
must
be
*NL*
owned
that
he
sometimes
went
rather
below
him
to
take
it
.
My
lady
was
*NL*
often
jealous
,
and
,
if
you
'll
believe
it
,
sir
,
she
did
me
the
honor
to
*NL*
be
jealous
of
me
.
One
day
I
had
a
red
ribbon
in
my
cap
,
and
my
lady
flew
*NL*
out
at
me
and
ordered
me
to
take
it
off
.
She
accused
me
of
putting
it
on
*NL*
to
make
the
marquis
look
at
me
.
I
do
n't
know
that
I
was
impertinent
,
but
*NL*
I
spoke
up
like
an
honest
girl
and
did
n't
count
my
words
.
A
red
ribbon
*NL*
indeed
!
As
if
it
was
my
ribbons
the
marquis
looked
at
!
My
lady
knew
*NL*
afterwards
that
I
was
perfectly
respectable
,
but
she
never
said
a
word
*NL*
to
show
that
she
believed
it
.
But
the
marquis
did
!
''
Mrs.
Bread
presently
*NL*
added
,
``
I
took
off
my
red
ribbon
and
put
it
away
in
a
drawer
,
where
I
*NL*
have
kept
it
to
this
day
.
It
's
faded
now
,
it
's
a
very
pale
pink
;
but
*NL*
there
it
lies
.
My
grudge
has
faded
,
too
;
the
red
has
all
gone
out
of
it
;
*NL*
but
it
lies
here
yet
.
''
And
Mrs.
Bread
stroked
her
black
satin
bodice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
listened
with
interest
to
this
decent
narrative
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
opened
up
the
deeps
of
memory
to
his
companion
.
Then
,
as
she
*NL*
remained
silent
,
and
seemed
to
be
losing
herself
in
retrospective
*NL*
meditation
upon
her
perfect
respectability
,
he
ventured
upon
a
short
*NL*
cut
to
his
goal
.
``
So
Madame
de
Bellegarde
was
jealous
;
I
see
.
And
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
admired
pretty
women
,
without
distinction
of
class
.
I
suppose
*NL*
one
must
n't
be
hard
upon
him
,
for
they
probably
did
n't
all
behave
so
*NL*
properly
as
you
.
But
years
afterwards
it
could
hardly
have
been
jealousy
*NL*
that
turned
Madame
de
Bellegarde
into
a
criminal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
gave
a
weary
sigh
.
``
We
are
using
dreadful
words
,
sir
,
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
now
.
I
see
you
have
your
idea
,
and
I
have
no
will
of
my
own
.
*NL*
My
will
was
the
will
of
my
children
,
as
I
called
them
;
but
I
have
lost
*NL*
my
children
now
.
They
are
dead
--
I
may
say
it
of
both
of
them
;
and
*NL*
what
should
I
care
for
the
living
?
What
is
any
one
in
the
house
to
me
*NL*
now
--
what
am
I
to
them
?
My
lady
objects
to
me
--
she
has
objected
to
me
*NL*
these
thirty
years
.
I
should
have
been
glad
to
be
something
to
young
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
though
I
never
was
nurse
to
the
present
marquis
.
*NL*
When
he
was
a
baby
I
was
too
young
;
they
would
n't
trust
me
with
him
.
But
*NL*
his
wife
told
her
own
maid
,
Mamselle
Clarisse
,
the
opinion
she
had
of
*NL*
me
.
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
hear
it
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
immensely
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
that
if
I
would
sit
in
her
children
's
schoolroom
I
should
do
*NL*
very
well
for
a
penwiper
!
When
things
have
come
to
that
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
need
stand
upon
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
not
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Go
on
,
Mrs.
Bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
,
however
,
relapsed
again
into
troubled
dumbness
,
and
all
*NL*
Newman
could
do
was
to
fold
his
arms
and
wait
.
But
at
last
she
appeared
*NL*
to
have
set
her
memories
in
order
.
``
It
was
when
the
late
marquis
was
an
*NL*
old
man
and
his
eldest
son
had
been
two
years
married
.
It
was
when
the
*NL*
time
came
on
for
marrying
Mademoiselle
Claire
;
that
's
the
way
they
talk
*NL*
of
it
here
,
you
know
,
sir
.
The
marquis
's
health
was
bad
;
he
was
very
*NL*
much
broken
down
.
My
lady
had
picked
out
M.
de
Cintre
,
for
no
good
*NL*
reason
that
I
could
see
.
But
there
are
reasons
,
I
very
well
know
,
that
*NL*
are
beyond
me
,
and
you
must
be
high
in
the
world
to
understand
them
.
Old
*NL*
M.
de
Cintre
was
very
high
,
and
my
lady
thought
him
almost
as
good
*NL*
as
herself
;
that
's
saying
a
good
deal
.
Mr.
Urbain
took
sides
with
his
*NL*
mother
,
as
he
always
did
.
The
trouble
,
I
believe
,
was
that
my
lady
would
*NL*
give
very
little
money
,
and
all
the
other
gentlemen
asked
more
.
It
was
*NL*
only
M.
de
Cintre
that
was
satisfied
.
The
Lord
willed
it
he
should
have
*NL*
that
one
soft
spot
;
it
was
the
only
one
he
had
.
He
may
have
been
very
*NL*
grand
in
his
birth
,
and
he
certainly
was
very
grand
in
his
bows
and
*NL*
speeches
;
but
that
was
all
the
grandeur
he
had
.
I
think
he
was
like
what
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
comedians
;
not
that
I
have
ever
seen
one
.
But
I
know
he
*NL*
painted
his
face
.
He
might
paint
it
all
he
would
;
he
could
never
make
me
*NL*
like
it
!
The
marquis
could
n't
abide
him
,
and
declared
that
sooner
than
*NL*
take
such
a
husband
as
that
Mademoiselle
Claire
should
take
none
at
*NL*
all
.
He
and
my
lady
had
a
great
scene
;
it
came
even
to
our
ears
in
the
*NL*
servants
'
hall
.
It
was
not
their
first
quarrel
,
if
the
truth
must
be
*NL*
told
.
They
were
not
a
loving
couple
,
but
they
did
n't
often
come
to
*NL*
words
,
because
,
I
think
,
neither
of
them
thought
the
other
's
doings
*NL*
worth
the
trouble
.
My
lady
had
long
ago
got
over
her
jealousy
,
and
she
*NL*
had
taken
to
indifference
.
In
this
,
I
must
say
,
they
were
well
matched
.
*NL*
The
marquis
was
very
easy-going
;
he
had
a
most
gentlemanly
temper
.
He
*NL*
got
angry
only
once
a
year
,
but
then
it
was
very
bad
.
He
always
took
to
*NL*
bed
directly
afterwards
.
This
time
I
speak
of
he
took
to
bed
as
usual
,
*NL*
but
he
never
got
up
again
.
I
'm
afraid
the
poor
gentleman
was
paying
for
*NL*
his
dissipation
;
is
n't
it
true
they
mostly
do
,
sir
,
when
they
get
old
?
*NL*
My
lady
and
Mr.
Urbain
kept
quiet
,
but
I
know
my
lady
wrote
letters
*NL*
to
M.
de
Cintre
.
The
marquis
got
worse
and
the
doctors
gave
him
up
.
My
*NL*
lady
,
she
gave
him
up
too
,
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
she
gave
up
*NL*
gladly
.
When
once
he
was
out
of
the
way
she
could
do
what
she
pleased
*NL*
with
her
daughter
,
and
it
was
all
arranged
that
my
poor
innocent
child
*NL*
should
be
handed
over
to
M.
de
Cintre
.
You
do
n't
know
what
Mademoiselle
*NL*
was
in
those
days
,
sir
;
she
was
the
sweetest
young
creature
in
France
,
*NL*
and
knew
as
little
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
as
the
lamb
does
of
*NL*
the
butcher
.
I
used
to
nurse
the
marquis
,
and
I
was
always
in
his
room
.
*NL*
It
was
here
at
Fleurieres
,
in
the
autumn
.
We
had
a
doctor
from
Paris
,
*NL*
who
came
and
stayed
two
or
three
weeks
in
the
house
.
Then
there
came
two
*NL*
others
,
and
there
was
a
consultation
,
and
these
two
others
,
as
I
said
,
*NL*
declared
that
the
marquis
could
n't
be
saved
.
After
this
they
went
off
,
*NL*
pocketing
their
fees
,
but
the
other
one
stayed
and
did
what
he
could
.
*NL*
The
marquis
himself
kept
crying
out
that
he
would
n't
die
,
that
he
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
die
,
that
he
would
live
and
look
after
his
daughter
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Claire
and
the
viscount
--
that
was
Mr.
Valentin
,
you
*NL*
know
--
were
both
in
the
house
.
The
doctor
was
a
clever
man
,
--
that
I
could
*NL*
see
myself
,
--
and
I
think
he
believed
that
the
marquis
might
get
well
.
We
*NL*
took
good
care
of
him
,
he
and
I
,
between
us
,
and
one
day
,
when
my
lady
*NL*
had
almost
ordered
her
mourning
,
my
patient
suddenly
began
to
mend
.
He
*NL*
got
better
and
better
,
till
the
doctor
said
he
was
out
of
danger
.
What
*NL*
was
killing
him
was
the
dreadful
fits
of
pain
in
his
stomach
.
But
little
*NL*
by
little
they
stopped
,
and
the
poor
marquis
began
to
make
his
jokes
*NL*
again
.
The
doctor
found
something
that
gave
him
great
comfort
--
some
*NL*
white
stuff
that
we
kept
in
a
great
bottle
on
the
chimney-piece
.
I
*NL*
used
to
give
it
to
the
marquis
through
a
glass
tube
;
it
always
made
him
*NL*
easier
.
Then
the
doctor
went
away
,
after
telling
me
to
keep
on
giving
*NL*
him
the
mixture
whenever
he
was
bad
.
After
that
there
was
a
little
*NL*
doctor
from
Poitiers
,
who
came
every
day
.
So
we
were
alone
in
the
*NL*
house
--
my
lady
and
her
poor
husband
and
their
three
children
.
Young
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
had
gone
away
,
with
her
little
girl
,
to
her
*NL*
mothers
.
You
know
she
is
very
lively
,
and
her
maid
told
me
that
she
*NL*
did
n't
like
to
be
where
people
were
dying
.
''
Mrs.
Bread
paused
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
then
she
went
on
with
the
same
quiet
consistency
.
``
I
think
you
*NL*
have
guessed
,
sir
,
that
when
the
marquis
began
to
turn
my
lady
was
*NL*
disappointed
.
''
And
she
paused
again
,
bending
upon
Newman
a
face
which
*NL*
seemed
to
grow
whiter
as
the
darkness
settled
down
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
had
listened
eagerly
--
with
an
eagerness
greater
even
than
that
*NL*
with
which
he
had
bent
his
ear
to
Valentin
de
Bellegarde
's
last
words
.
*NL*
Every
now
and
then
,
as
his
companion
looked
up
at
him
,
she
reminded
him
*NL*
of
an
ancient
tabby
cat
,
protracting
the
enjoyment
of
a
dish
of
milk
.
*NL*
Even
her
triumph
was
measured
and
decorous
;
the
faculty
of
exultation
*NL*
had
been
chilled
by
disuse
.
She
presently
continued
.
``
Late
one
night
I
*NL*
was
sitting
by
the
marquis
in
his
room
,
the
great
red
room
in
the
west
*NL*
tower
.
He
had
been
complaining
a
little
,
and
I
gave
him
a
spoonful
*NL*
of
the
doctor
's
dose
.
My
lady
had
been
there
in
the
early
part
of
the
*NL*
evening
;
she
sat
far
more
than
an
hour
by
his
bed
.
Then
she
went
away
*NL*
and
left
me
alone
.
After
midnight
she
came
back
,
and
her
eldest
son
was
*NL*
with
her
.
They
went
to
the
bed
and
looked
at
the
marquis
,
and
my
lady
*NL*
took
hold
of
his
hand
.
Then
she
turned
to
me
and
said
he
was
not
so
*NL*
well
;
I
remember
how
the
marquis
,
without
saying
anything
,
lay
staring
*NL*
at
her
.
I
can
see
his
white
face
,
at
this
moment
,
in
the
great
black
*NL*
square
between
the
bed-curtains
.
I
said
I
did
n't
think
he
was
very
bad
;
*NL*
and
she
told
me
to
go
to
bed
--
she
would
sit
a
while
with
him
.
When
the
*NL*
marquis
saw
me
going
he
gave
a
sort
of
groan
,
and
called
out
to
me
not
*NL*
to
leave
him
;
but
Mr.
Urbain
opened
the
door
for
me
and
pointed
the
*NL*
way
out
.
The
present
marquis
--
perhaps
you
have
noticed
,
sir
--
has
a
very
*NL*
proud
way
of
giving
orders
,
and
I
was
there
to
take
orders
.
I
went
to
*NL*
my
room
,
but
I
was
n't
easy
;
I
could
n't
tell
you
why
.
I
did
n't
undress
;
*NL*
I
sat
there
waiting
and
listening
.
For
what
,
would
you
have
said
,
sir
?
I
*NL*
could
n't
have
told
you
;
for
surely
a
poor
gentleman
might
be
comfortable
*NL*
with
his
wife
and
his
son
.
It
was
as
if
I
expected
to
hear
the
marquis
*NL*
moaning
after
me
again
.
I
listened
,
but
I
heard
nothing
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
still
night
;
I
never
knew
a
night
so
still
.
At
last
the
very
stillness
*NL*
itself
seemed
to
frighten
me
,
and
I
came
out
of
my
room
and
went
very
*NL*
softly
down-stairs
.
In
the
anteroom
,
outside
of
the
marquis
's
chamber
,
*NL*
I
found
Mr.
Urbain
walking
up
and
down
.
He
asked
me
what
I
wanted
,
and
*NL*
I
said
I
came
back
to
relieve
my
lady
.
He
said
HE
would
relieve
my
lady
,
*NL*
and
ordered
me
back
to
bed
;
but
as
I
stood
there
,
unwilling
to
turn
*NL*
away
,
the
door
of
the
room
opened
and
my
lady
came
out
.
I
noticed
she
*NL*
was
very
pale
;
she
was
very
strange
.
She
looked
a
moment
at
the
count
*NL*
and
at
me
,
and
then
she
held
out
her
arms
to
the
count
.
He
went
to
her
,
*NL*
and
she
fell
upon
him
and
hid
her
face
.
I
went
quickly
past
her
into
the
*NL*
room
and
to
the
marquis
's
bed
.
He
was
lying
there
,
very
white
,
with
his
*NL*
eyes
shut
,
like
a
corpse
.
I
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
spoke
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
to
me
like
a
dead
man
.
Then
I
turned
round
;
my
lady
and
*NL*
Mr.
Urbain
were
there
.
`
My
poor
Bread
,
'
said
my
lady
,
'M
.
le
Marquis
is
*NL*
gone
.
'
Mr.
Urbain
knelt
down
by
the
bed
and
said
softly
,
`
Mon
pere
,
mon
*NL*
pere
.
'
I
thought
it
wonderful
strange
,
and
asked
my
lady
what
in
the
*NL*
world
had
happened
,
and
why
she
had
n't
called
me
.
She
said
nothing
had
*NL*
happened
;
that
she
had
only
been
sitting
there
with
the
marquis
,
very
*NL*
quiet
.
She
had
closed
her
eyes
,
thinking
she
might
sleep
,
and
she
had
*NL*
slept
,
she
did
n't
know
how
long
.
When
she
woke
up
he
was
dead
.
`
It
's
*NL*
death
,
my
son
,
It
's
death
,
'
she
said
to
the
count
.
Mr.
Urbain
said
they
*NL*
must
have
the
doctor
,
immediately
,
from
Poitiers
,
and
that
he
would
ride
*NL*
off
and
fetch
him
.
He
kissed
his
father
's
face
,
and
then
he
kissed
his
*NL*
mother
and
went
away
.
My
lady
and
I
stood
there
at
the
bedside
.
As
I
*NL*
looked
at
the
poor
marquis
it
came
into
my
head
that
he
was
not
dead
,
*NL*
that
he
was
in
a
kind
of
swoon
.
And
then
my
lady
repeated
,
`
My
poor
*NL*
Bread
,
it
's
death
,
it
's
death
;
'
and
I
said
,
`
Yes
,
my
lady
,
it
's
*NL*
certainly
death
.
'
I
said
just
the
opposite
to
what
I
believed
;
it
was
my
*NL*
notion
.
Then
my
lady
said
we
must
wait
for
the
doctor
,
and
we
sat
there
*NL*
and
waited
.
It
was
a
long
time
;
the
poor
marquis
neither
stirred
nor
*NL*
changed
.
'
I
have
seen
death
before
,
'
said
my
lady
,
`
and
it
's
terribly
*NL*
like
this
.
'
`
Yes
please
,
my
lady
,
'
said
I
;
and
I
kept
thinking
.
The
*NL*
night
wore
away
without
the
count
's
coming
back
,
and
my
lady
began
to
*NL*
be
frightened
.
She
was
afraid
he
had
had
an
accident
in
the
dark
,
or
met
*NL*
with
some
wild
people
.
At
last
she
got
so
restless
that
she
went
below
*NL*
to
watch
in
the
court
for
her
son
's
return
.
I
sat
there
alone
and
the
*NL*
marquis
never
stirred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs.
Bread
paused
again
,
and
the
most
artistic
of
romancers
could
*NL*
not
have
been
more
effective
.
Newman
made
a
movement
as
if
he
were
*NL*
turning
over
the
page
of
a
novel
.
``
So
he
WAS
dead
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
days
afterwards
he
was
in
his
grave
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
*NL*
sententiously
.
``
In
a
little
while
I
went
away
to
the
front
of
the
house
*NL*
and
looked
out
into
the
court
,
and
there
,
before
long
,
I
saw
Mr.
Urbain
*NL*
ride
in
alone
.
I
waited
a
bit
,
to
hear
him
come
upstairs
with
his
*NL*
mother
,
but
they
stayed
below
,
and
I
went
back
to
the
marquis
's
room
.
*NL*
I
went
to
the
bed
and
held
up
the
light
to
him
,
but
I
do
n't
know
why
*NL*
I
did
n't
let
the
candlestick
fall
.
The
marquis
's
eyes
were
open
--
open
*NL*
wide
!
they
were
staring
at
me
.
I
knelt
down
beside
him
and
took
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
begged
him
to
tell
me
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
whether
he
was
*NL*
alive
or
dead
.
Still
he
looked
at
me
a
long
time
,
and
then
he
made
me
a
*NL*
sign
to
put
my
ear
close
to
him
:
'
I
am
dead
,
'
he
said
,
'
I
am
dead
.
The
*NL*
marquise
has
killed
me
.
'
I
was
all
in
a
tremble
;
I
did
n't
understand
*NL*
him
.
He
seemed
both
a
man
and
a
corpse
,
if
you
can
fancy
,
sir
.
`
But
*NL*
you
'll
get
well
now
,
sir
,
'
I
said
.
And
then
he
whispered
again
,
ever
*NL*
so
weak
;
'
I
would
n't
get
well
for
a
kingdom
.
I
would
n't
be
that
woman
's
*NL*
husband
again
.
'
And
then
he
said
more
;
he
said
she
had
murdered
him
.
*NL*
I
asked
him
what
she
had
done
to
him
,
but
he
only
replied
,
`
Murder
,
*NL*
murder
.
And
she
'll
kill
my
daughter
,
'
he
said
;
`
my
poor
unhappy
child
.
'
*NL*
And
he
begged
me
to
prevent
that
,
and
then
he
said
that
he
was
dying
,
*NL*
that
he
was
dead
.
I
was
afraid
to
move
or
to
leave
him
;
I
was
almost
*NL*
dead
myself
.
All
of
a
sudden
he
asked
me
to
get
a
pencil
and
write
for
*NL*
him
;
and
then
I
had
to
tell
him
that
I
could
n't
manage
a
pencil
.
He
*NL*
asked
me
to
hold
him
up
in
bed
while
he
wrote
himself
,
and
I
said
he
*NL*
could
never
,
never
do
such
a
thing
.
But
he
seemed
to
have
a
kind
of
*NL*
terror
that
gave
him
strength
.
I
found
a
pencil
in
the
room
and
a
piece
*NL*
of
paper
and
a
book
,
and
I
put
the
paper
on
the
book
and
the
pencil
into
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
moved
the
candle
near
him
.
You
will
think
all
this
very
*NL*
strange
,
sir
;
and
very
strange
it
was
.
The
strangest
part
of
it
was
that
*NL*
I
believed
he
was
dying
,
and
that
I
was
eager
to
help
him
to
write
.
I
*NL*
sat
on
the
bed
and
put
my
arm
round
him
,
and
held
him
up
.
I
felt
very
*NL*
strong
;
I
believe
I
could
have
lifted
him
and
carried
him
.
It
was
a
*NL*
wonder
how
he
wrote
,
but
he
did
write
,
in
a
big
scratching
hand
;
he
*NL*
almost
covered
one
side
of
the
paper
.
It
seemed
a
long
time
;
I
suppose
*NL*
it
was
three
or
four
minutes
.
He
was
groaning
,
terribly
,
all
the
while
.
*NL*
Then
he
said
it
was
ended
,
and
I
let
him
down
upon
his
pillows
and
he
*NL*
gave
me
the
paper
and
told
me
to
fold
it
,
and
hide
it
,
and
give
it
to
*NL*
those
who
would
act
upon
it
.
`
Whom
do
you
mean
?
'
I
said
.
`
Who
are
those
*NL*
who
will
act
upon
it
?
'
But
he
only
groaned
,
for
an
answer
;
he
could
n't
*NL*
speak
,
for
weakness
.
In
a
few
minutes
he
told
me
to
go
and
look
at
the
*NL*
bottle
on
the
chimney-piece
.
I
knew
the
bottle
he
meant
;
the
white
*NL*
stuff
that
was
good
for
his
stomach
.
I
went
and
looked
at
it
,
but
it
was
*NL*
empty
.
When
I
came
back
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
was
staring
at
me
;
but
*NL*
soon
he
closed
them
and
he
said
no
more
.
I
hid
the
paper
in
my
dress
;
*NL*
I
did
n't
look
at
what
was
written
upon
it
,
though
I
can
read
very
well
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
I
have
n't
any
handwriting
.
I
sat
down
near
the
bed
,
but
it
was
*NL*
nearly
half
an
hour
before
my
lady
and
the
count
came
in
.
The
marquis
*NL*
looked
as
he
did
when
they
left
him
,
and
I
never
said
a
word
about
his
*NL*
having
been
otherwise
.
Mr.
Urbain
said
that
the
doctor
had
been
*NL*
called
to
a
person
in
child-birth
,
but
that
he
promised
to
set
out
for
*NL*
Fleurieres
immediately
.
In
another
half
hour
he
arrived
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
had
examined
the
marquis
he
said
that
we
had
had
a
false
alarm
.
The
*NL*
poor
gentleman
was
very
low
,
but
he
was
still
living
.
I
watched
my
lady
*NL*
and
her
son
when
he
said
this
,
to
see
if
they
looked
at
each
other
,
and
*NL*
I
am
obliged
to
admit
that
they
did
n't
.
The
doctor
said
there
was
no
*NL*
reason
he
should
die
;
he
had
been
going
on
so
well
.
And
then
he
wanted
*NL*
to
know
how
he
had
suddenly
fallen
off
;
he
had
left
him
so
very
hearty
.
*NL*
My
lady
told
her
little
story
again
--
what
she
had
told
Mr.
Urbain
and
*NL*
me
--
and
the
doctor
looked
at
her
and
said
nothing
.
He
stayed
all
the
*NL*
next
day
at
the
chateau
,
and
hardly
left
the
marquis
.
I
was
always
*NL*
there
.
Mademoiselle
and
Mr.
Valentin
came
and
looked
at
their
father
,
*NL*
but
he
never
stirred
.
It
was
a
strange
,
deathly
stupor
.
My
lady
was
*NL*
always
about
;
her
face
was
as
white
as
her
husband
's
,
and
she
looked
*NL*
very
proud
,
as
I
had
seen
her
look
when
her
orders
or
her
wishes
had
*NL*
been
disobeyed
.
It
was
as
if
the
poor
marquis
had
defied
her
;
and
the
*NL*
way
she
took
it
made
me
afraid
of
her
.
The
apothecary
from
Poitiers
kept
*NL*
the
marquis
along
through
the
day
,
and
we
waited
for
the
other
doctor
*NL*
from
Paris
,
who
,
as
I
told
you
,
had
been
staying
at
Fleurieres
.
They
had
*NL*
telegraphed
for
him
early
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
evening
he
arrived
.
*NL*
He
talked
a
bit
outside
with
the
doctor
from
Poitiers
,
and
then
they
*NL*
came
in
to
see
the
marquis
together
.
I
was
with
him
,
and
so
was
Mr.
*NL*
Urbain
.
My
lady
had
been
to
receive
the
doctor
from
Paris
,
and
she
*NL*
did
n't
come
back
with
him
into
the
room
.
He
sat
down
by
the
marquis
;
*NL*
I
can
see
him
there
now
,
with
his
hand
on
the
marquis
's
wrist
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Urbain
watching
him
with
a
little
looking-glass
in
his
hand
.
`
I
'm
sure
*NL*
he
's
better
,
'
said
the
little
doctor
from
Poitiers
;
`
I
'm
sure
he
'll
come
*NL*
back
.
'
A
few
moments
after
he
had
said
this
the
marquis
opened
his
eyes
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
waking
up
,
and
looked
at
us
,
from
one
to
the
other
.
I
saw
*NL*
him
look
at
me
,
very
softly
,
as
you
'd
say
.
At
the
same
moment
my
lady
*NL*
came
in
on
tiptoe
;
she
came
up
to
the
bed
and
put
in
her
head
between
me
*NL*
and
the
count
.
The
marquis
saw
her
and
gave
a
long
,
most
wonderful
moan
.
*NL*
He
said
something
we
could
n't
understand
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
a
kind
*NL*
of
spasm
.
He
shook
all
over
and
then
closed
his
eyes
,
and
the
doctor
*NL*
jumped
up
and
took
hold
of
my
lady
.
He
held
her
for
a
moment
a
bit
*NL*
roughly
.
The
marquis
was
stone
dead
!
This
time
there
were
those
there
*NL*
that
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
felt
as
if
he
had
been
reading
by
starlight
the
report
of
highly
*NL*
important
evidence
in
a
great
murder
case
.
``
And
the
paper
--
the
paper
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
excitedly
.
``
What
was
written
upon
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
sir
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
I
could
n't
read
it
;
it
*NL*
was
in
French
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
could
no
one
else
read
it
?

Newman
seized

in
both

pressed
it

vigorously
.

strong

Mrs.

got
up
with
a
certain
majesty
.
``
It
is
not
so
easy
as
that

If
you

you
must
wait

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
waiting
is
horrible

you
know

urged
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
have
waited

I
have
waited
these
many
years

said
Mrs.

Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
true
.
You
have
waited
for
me
.
I
wo
n't
forget
it
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
how
comes
it
you
did
n't
do
as
M.
de
Bellegarde
said
,
show
the
paper
to
*NL*
some
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
should
I
show
it
?
''
answered
Mrs.
Bread
,
mournfully
.
``
It
was
not
*NL*
easy
to
know
,
and
many
's
the
night
I
have
lain
awake
thinking
of
it
.
*NL*
Six
months
afterwards
,
when
they
married
Mademoiselle
to
her
vicious
old
*NL*
husband
,
I
was
very
near
bringing
it
out
.
I
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
do
*NL*
something
with
it
,
and
yet
I
was
mightily
afraid
.
I
did
n't
know
what
*NL*
was
written
on
the
paper
or
how
bad
it
might
be
,
and
there
was
no
one
*NL*
I
could
trust
enough
to
ask
.
And
it
seemed
to
me
a
cruel
kindness
to
do
*NL*
that
sweet
young
creature
,
letting
her
know
that
her
father
had
written
*NL*
her
mother
down
so
shamefully
;
for
that
's
what
he
did
,
I
suppose
.
I
*NL*
thought
she
would
rather
be
unhappy
with
her
husband
than
be
unhappy
*NL*
that
way
.
It
was
for
her
and
for
my
dear
Mr.
Valentin
I
kept
quiet
.
*NL*
Quiet
I
call
it
,
but
for
me
it
was
a
weary
quietness
.
It
worried
me
*NL*
terribly
,
and
it
changed
me
altogether
.
But
for
others
I
held
my
tongue
,
*NL*
and
no
one
,
to
this
hour
,
knows
what
passed
between
the
poor
marquis
and
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
evidently
there
were
suspicions
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Where
did
Mr.
*NL*
Valentin
get
his
ideas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
little
doctor
from
Poitiers
.
He
was
very
ill-satisfied
,
and
*NL*
he
made
a
great
talk
.
He
was
a
sharp
Frenchman
,
and
coming
to
the
house
,
*NL*
as
he
did
day
after
day
,
I
suppose
he
saw
more
than
he
seemed
to
see
.
*NL*
And
indeed
the
way
the
poor
marquis
went
off
as
soon
as
his
eyes
fell
on
*NL*
my
lady
was
a
most
shocking
sight
for
anyone
.
The
medical
gentleman
from
*NL*
Paris
was
much
more
accommodating
,
and
he
hushed
up
the
other
.
But
for
*NL*
all
he
could
do
Mr.
Valentin
and
Mademoiselle
heard
something
;
they
knew
*NL*
their
father
's
death
was
somehow
against
nature
.
Of
course
they
could
n't
*NL*
accuse
their
mother
,
and
,
as
I
tell
you
,
I
was
as
dumb
as
that
stone
.
*NL*
Mr.
Valentin
used
to
look
at
me
sometimes
,
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
shine
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
asking
me
something
.
I
was
dreadfully
afraid
*NL*
he
would
speak
,
and
I
always
looked
away
and
went
about
my
business
.
If
*NL*
I
were
to
tell
him
,
I
was
sure
he
would
hate
me
afterwards
,
and
that
I
*NL*
could
never
have
borne
.
Once
I
went
up
to
him
and
took
a
great
liberty
;
*NL*
I
kissed
him
,
as
I
had
kissed
him
when
he
was
a
child
.
`
You
ought
n't
to
*NL*
look
so
sad
,
sir
,
'
I
said
;
`
believe
your
poor
old
Bread
.
Such
a
gallant
,
*NL*
handsome
young
man
can
have
nothing
to
be
sad
about
.
'
And
I
think
he
*NL*
understood
me
;
he
understood
that
I
was
begging
off
,
and
he
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
in
his
own
way
.
He
went
about
with
his
unasked
question
in
*NL*
his
mind
,
as
I
did
with
my
untold
tale
;
we
were
both
afraid
of
bringing
*NL*
dishonor
on
a
great
house
.
And
it
was
the
same
with
Mademoiselle
.
She
*NL*
did
n't
know
what
happened
;
she
would
n't
know
.
My
lady
and
Mr.
Urbain
*NL*
asked
me
no
questions
because
they
had
no
reason
.
I
was
as
still
as
*NL*
a
mouse
.
When
I
was
younger
my
lady
thought
me
a
hussy
,
and
now
she
*NL*
thought
me
a
fool
.
How
should
I
have
any
ideas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
the
little
doctor
from
Poitiers
made
a
talk
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
Did
no
one
take
it
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
nothing
of
it
,
sir
.
They
are
always
talking
scandal
in
these
*NL*
foreign
countries
you
may
have
noticed
--
and
I
suppose
they
shook
their
*NL*
heads
over
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
But
after
all
,
what
could
they
say
?
The
*NL*
marquis
had
been
ill
,
and
the
marquis
had
died
;
he
had
as
good
a
right
*NL*
to
die
as
any
one
.
The
doctor
could
n't
say
he
had
not
come
honestly
by
*NL*
his
cramps
.
The
next
year
the
little
doctor
left
the
place
and
bought
a
*NL*
practice
in
Bordeaux
,
and
if
there
has
been
any
gossip
it
died
out
.
And
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
there
could
have
been
much
gossip
about
my
lady
that
any
*NL*
one
would
listen
to
.
My
lady
is
so
very
respectable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
at
this
last
affirmation
,
broke
into
an
immense
,
resounding
*NL*
laugh
.
Mrs.
Bread
had
begun
to
move
away
from
the
spot
where
they
were
*NL*
sitting
,
and
he
helped
her
through
the
aperture
in
the
wall
and
*NL*
along
the
homeward
path
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
my
lady
's
respectability
is
*NL*
delicious
;
it
will
be
a
great
crash
!
''
They
reached
the
empty
space
in
*NL*
front
of
the
church
,
where
they
stopped
a
moment
,
looking
at
each
*NL*
other
with
something
of
an
air
of
closer
fellowship
--
like
two
sociable
*NL*
conspirators
.
``
But
what
was
it
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
what
was
it
she
did
to
*NL*
her
husband
?
She
did
n't
stab
him
or
poison
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
;
no
one
saw
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
it
was
Mr.
Urbain
.
You
say
he
was
walking
up
and
down
,
outside
*NL*
the
room
.
Perhaps
he
looked
through
the
keyhole
.
But
no
;
I
think
that
*NL*
with
his
mother
he
would
take
it
on
trust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
sure
I
have
often
thought
of
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
I
*NL*
am
sure
she
did
n't
touch
him
with
her
hands
.
I
saw
nothing
on
him
,
*NL*
anywhere
.
I
believe
it
was
in
this
way
.
He
had
a
fit
of
his
great
pain
,
*NL*
and
he
asked
her
for
his
medicine
.
Instead
of
giving
it
to
him
she
went
*NL*
and
poured
it
away
,
before
his
eyes
.
Then
he
saw
what
she
meant
,
and
,
*NL*
weak
and
helpless
as
he
was
,
he
was
frightened
,
he
was
terrified
.
`
You
*NL*
want
to
kill
me

he
said
.
`
Yes

M.
le
Marquis
,
I
want
to
kill
you

*NL*
says
my
lady
,
and
sits
down
and
fixes
her
eyes
upon
him
.
You
know
my
*NL*
lady
's
eyes
,
I
think
,
sir
;
it
was
with
them
she
killed
him
;
it
was
*NL*
with
the
terrible
strong
will
she
put
into
them
.
It
was
like
a
frost
on
*NL*
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
a
very
intelligent
woman
;
you
have
shown
great
*NL*
discretion
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
shall
value
your
services
as
housekeeper
*NL*
extremely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
begun
to
descend
the
hill
,
and
Mrs.
Bread
said
nothing
until
*NL*
they
reached
the
foot
.
Newman
strolled
lightly
beside
her
;
his
head
was
*NL*
thrown
back
and
he
was
gazing
at
all
the
stars
;
he
seemed
to
himself
to
*NL*
be
riding
his
vengeance
along
the
Milky
Way
.
``
So
you
are
serious
,
sir
,
*NL*
about
that
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
your
living
with
me
?
Why
of
course
I
will
take
care
of
you
to
the
*NL*
end
of
your
days
.
You
ca
n't
live
with
those
people
any
longer

And
you
*NL*
ought
n't
to
,
you
know
,
after
this
.
You
give
me
the
paper
,
and
you
move
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
very
flighty
in
me
to
be
taking
a
new
place
at
this
time
of
*NL*
life
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Bread
,
lugubriously
.
``
But
if
you
are
going
to
turn
*NL*
the
house
upside
down
,
I
would
rather
be
out
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
in
the
cheerful
tone
of
a
man
who
feels
rich
in
*NL*
alternatives
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
bring
in
the
constables
,
if
that
's
*NL*
what
you
mean

Whatever
Madame
de
Bellegarde
did
,
I
am
afraid
the
law
*NL*
ca
n't
take
hold
of
it
.
But
I
am
glad
of
that
;
it
leaves
it
altogether
to
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
mighty
bold
gentleman
,
sir
,
''
murmured
Mrs.
Bread
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
round
the
edge
of
her
great
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
with
her
back
to
the
chateau
;
the
curfew
had
tolled
for
the
*NL*
laborious
villagers
of
Fleurieres
,
and
the
street
was
unlighted
and
*NL*
empty
.
She
promised
him
that
he
should
have
the
marquis
's
manuscript
in
*NL*
half
an
hour
.
Mrs.
Bread
choosing
not
to
go
in
by
the
great
gate
,
they
*NL*
passed
round
by
a
winding
lane
to
a
door
in
the
wall
of
the
park
,
of
*NL*
which
she
had
the
key
,
and
which
would
enable
her
to
enter
the
chateau
*NL*
from
behind
.
Newman
arranged
with
her
that
he
should
await
outside
the
*NL*
wall
her
return
with
the
coveted
document
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
,
and
his
half
hour
in
the
dusky
lane
seemed
very
long
.
But
*NL*
he
had
plenty
to
think
about
.
At
last
the
door
in
the
wall
opened
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
stood
there
,
with
one
hand
on
the
latch
and
the
other
holding
*NL*
out
a
scrap
of
white
paper
,
folded
small
.
In
a
moment
he
was
master
of
*NL*
it
,
and
it
had
passed
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
``
Come
and
see
me
in
*NL*
Paris
,
''
he
said
;
``
we
are
to
settle
your
future
,
you
know
;
and
I
will
*NL*
translate
poor
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
French
to
you
.
''
Never
had
he
felt
so
*NL*
grateful
as
at
this
moment
for
M.
Nioche
's
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
's
dull
eyes
had
followed
the
disappearance
of
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
she
gave
a
heavy
sigh
.
``
Well
,
you
have
done
what
you
would
with
me
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
I
suppose
you
will
do
it
again
.
You
MUST
take
care
of
me
now
.
You
*NL*
are
a
terribly
positive
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
'm
a
terribly
impatient
gentleman
!
''
And
he
*NL*
bade
her
good-night
and
walked
rapidly
back
to
the
inn
.
He
ordered
his
*NL*
vehicle
to
be
prepared
for
his
return
to
Poitiers
,
and
then
he
shut
*NL*
the
door
of
the
common
salle
and
strode
toward
the
solitary
lamp
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
He
pulled
out
the
paper
and
quickly
unfolded
it
.
It
was
*NL*
covered
with
pencil-marks
,
which
at
first
,
in
the
feeble
light
,
seemed
*NL*
indistinct
.
But
Newman
's
fierce
curiosity
forced
a
meaning
from
the
*NL*
tremulous
signs
.
The
English
of
them
was
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
has
tried
to
kill
me
,
and
she
has
done
it
;
I
am
dying
,
dying
*NL*
horribly
.
It
is
to
marry
my
dear
daughter
to
M.
de
Cintre
.
With
all
my
*NL*
soul
I
protest
,
--
I
forbid
it
.
I
am
not
insane

--
ask
the
doctors
,
ask
*NL*
Mrs.
B

.
It
was
alone
with
me
here
,
to-night
;
she
attacked
me
and
put
*NL*
me
to
death
.
It
is
murder
,
if
murder
ever
was

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
returned
to
Paris
the
second
day
after
his
interview
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
.
The
morrow
he
had
spent
at
Poitiers
,
reading
over
and
over
again
*NL*
the
little
document
which
he
had
lodged
in
his
pocket-book
,
and
thinking
*NL*
what
he
would
do
in
the
circumstances
and
how
he
would
do
it
.
He
would
*NL*
not
have
said
that
Poitiers
was
an
amusing
place
;
yet
the
day
seemed
*NL*
very
short
.
Domiciled
once
more
in
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
,
he
walked
*NL*
over
to
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
and
inquired
of
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
*NL*
portress
whether
the
marquise
had
come
back
.
The
portress
told
him
that
*NL*
she
had
arrived
,
with
M.
le
Marquis
,
on
the
preceding
day
,
and
further
*NL*
informed
him
that
if
he
desired
to
enter
,
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
*NL*
son
were
both
at
home
.
As
she
said
these
words
the
little
white-faced
*NL*
old
woman
who
peered
out
of
the
dusky
gate-house
of
the
Hotel
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
gave
a
small
wicked
smile
--
a
smile
which
seemed
to
Newman
*NL*
to
mean
,
``
Go
in
if
you
dare
!
''
She
was
evidently
versed
in
the
current
*NL*
domestic
history
;
she
was
placed
where
she
could
feel
the
pulse
of
the
*NL*
house
.
Newman
stood
a
moment
,
twisting
his
mustache
and
looking
at
her
;
*NL*
then
he
abruptly
turned
away
.
But
this
was
not
because
he
was
afraid
*NL*
to
go
in
--
though
he
doubted
whether
,
if
he
did
so
,
he
should
be
able
*NL*
to
make
his
way
,
unchallenged
,
into
the
presence
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
*NL*
relatives
.
Confidence
--
excessive
confidence
,
perhaps
--
quite
as
much
as
*NL*
timidity
prompted
his
retreat
.
He
was
nursing
his
thunder-bolt
;
he
loved
*NL*
it
;
he
was
unwilling
to
part
with
it
.
He
seemed
to
be
holding
it
aloft
*NL*
in
the
rumbling
,
vaguely-flashing
air
,
directly
over
the
heads
of
his
*NL*
victims
,
and
he
fancied
he
could
see
their
pale
,
upturned
faces
.
Few
*NL*
specimens
of
the
human
countenance
had
ever
given
him
such
pleasure
*NL*
as
these
,
lighted
in
the
lurid
fashion
I
have
hinted
at
,
and
he
was
*NL*
disposed
to
sip
the
cup
of
contemplative
revenge
in
a
leisurely
fashion
.
*NL*
It
must
be
added
,
too
,
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
see
exactly
how
he
could
*NL*
arrange
to
witness
the
operation
of
his
thunder
.
To
send
in
his
card
to
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
would
be
a
waste
of
ceremony
;
she
would
certainly
*NL*
decline
to
receive
him
.
On
the
other
hand
he
could
not
force
his
way
*NL*
into
her
presence
.
It
annoyed
him
keenly
to
think
that
he
might
be
*NL*
reduced
to
the
blind
satisfaction
of
writing
her
a
letter
;
but
he
*NL*
consoled
himself
in
a
measure
with
the
reflection
that
a
letter
might
*NL*
lead
to
an
interview
.
He
went
home
,
and
feeling
rather
tired
--
nursing
a
*NL*
vengeance
was
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
a
rather
fatiguing
process
;
it
*NL*
took
a
good
deal
out
of
one
--
flung
himself
into
one
of
his
brocaded
*NL*
fauteuils
,
stretched
his
legs
,
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
and
,
*NL*
while
he
watched
the
reflected
sunset
fading
from
the
ornate
house-tops
*NL*
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
Boulevard
,
began
mentally
to
compose
a
cool
*NL*
epistle
to
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
While
he
was
so
occupied
his
servant
*NL*
threw
open
the
door
and
announced
ceremoniously
,
``
Madame
Brett
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
roused
himself
,
expectantly
,
and
in
a
few
moments
perceived
upon
*NL*
his
threshold
the
worthy
woman
with
whom
he
had
conversed
to
such
good
*NL*
purpose
on
the
starlit
hill-top
of
Fleurieres
.
Mrs.
Bread
had
made
for
*NL*
this
visit
the
same
toilet
as
for
her
former
expedition
.
Newman
was
*NL*
struck
with
her
distinguished
appearance
.
His
lamp
was
not
lit
,
and
as
*NL*
her
large
,
grave
face
gazed
at
him
through
the
light
dusk
from
under
*NL*
the
shadow
of
her
ample
bonnet
,
he
felt
the
incongruity
of
such
a
person
*NL*
presenting
herself
as
a
servant
.
He
greeted
her
with
high
geniality
and
*NL*
bade
her
come
in
and
sit
down
and
make
herself
comfortable
.
There
was
*NL*
something
which
might
have
touched
the
springs
both
of
mirth
and
of
*NL*
melancholy
in
the
ancient
maidenliness
with
which
Mrs.
Bread
endeavored
*NL*
to
comply
with
these
directions
.
She
was
not
playing
at
being
fluttered
,
*NL*
which
would
have
been
simply
ridiculous
;
she
was
doing
her
best
to
carry
*NL*
herself
as
a
person
so
humble
that
,
for
her
,
even
embarrassment
would
*NL*
have
been
pretentious
;
but
evidently
she
had
never
dreamed
of
its
being
*NL*
in
her
horoscope
to
pay
a
visit
,
at
night-fall
,
to
a
friendly
single
*NL*
gentleman
who
lived
in
theatrical-looking
rooms
on
one
of
the
new
*NL*
Boulevards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
truly
hope
I
am
not
forgetting
my
place
,
sir
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgetting
your
place
?
''
cried
Newman
.
``
Why
,
you
are
remembering
it
.
*NL*
This
is
your
place
,
you
know
.
You
are
already
in
my
service
;
your
wages
,
*NL*
as
housekeeper
,
began
a
fortnight
ago
.
I
can
tell
you
my
house
wants
*NL*
keeping
!
Why
do
n't
you
take
off
your
bonnet
and
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
off
my
bonnet
?
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
with
timid
literalness
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
have
n't
my
cap
.
And
with
your
leave
,
sir
,
I
could
n't
keep
house
in
my
*NL*
best
gown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
your
gown
,
''
said
Newman
,
cheerfully
.
``
You
shall
have
a
*NL*
better
gown
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
stared
solemnly
and
then
stretched
her
hands
over
her
*NL*
lustreless
satin
skirt
,
as
if
the
perilous
side
of
her
situation
were
*NL*
defining
itself
.
``
Oh
,
sir
,
I
am
fond
of
my
own
clothes
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
left
those
wicked
people
,
at
any
rate
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
here
I
am
!
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
That
's
all
I
can
tell
you
.
*NL*
Here
I
sit
,
poor
Catherine
Bread
.
It
's
a
strange
place
for
me
to
be
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
myself
;
I
never
supposed
I
was
so
bold
.
But
indeed
,
sir
,
I
*NL*
have
gone
as
far
as
my
own
strength
will
bear
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
Mrs.
Bread
,
''
said
Newman
,
almost
caressingly
,
``
do
n't
make
*NL*
yourself
uncomfortable
.
Now
's
the
time
to
feel
lively
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
speak
again
with
a
trembling
voice
.
``
I
think
it
would
be
*NL*
more
respectable
if
I
could
--
if
I
could
''
--
and
her
voice
trembled
to
a
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
could
give
up
this
sort
of
thing
altogether
?
''
said
Newman
*NL*
kindly
,
trying
to
anticipate
her
meaning
,
which
he
supposed
might
be
a
*NL*
wish
to
retire
from
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
give
up
everything
,
sir
!
All
I
should
ask
is
a
decent
*NL*
Protestant
burial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burial
!
''
cried
Newman
,
with
a
burst
of
laughter
.
``
Why
,
to
bury
you
now
*NL*
would
be
a
sad
piece
of
extravagance
.
It
's
only
rascals
who
have
to
be
*NL*
buried
to
get
respectable
.
Honest
folks
like
you
and
me
can
live
our
*NL*
time
out
--
and
live
together
.
Come
!
Did
you
bring
your
baggage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
box
is
locked
and
corded
;
but
I
have
n't
yet
spoken
to
my
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
to
her
,
then
,
and
have
done
with
it
.
I
should
like
to
have
your
*NL*
chance

''
cried
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
gladly
give
it
you
,
sir
.
I
have
passed
some
weary
hours
in
my
*NL*
lady
's
dressing-room
;
but
this
will
be
one
of
the
longest
.
She
will
tax
*NL*
me
with
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
so
long
as
you
can
tax
her
with
murder
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
I
ca
n't
;
not
I
,
''
sighed
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
anything
about
it
?
So
much
the
better
.
Leave
that
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
calls
me
a
thankless
old
woman
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
``
I
shall
have
*NL*
nothing
to
say
.
But
it
is
better
so
,
''
she
softly
added
.
``
She
shall
be
my
*NL*
lady
to
the
last
.
That
will
be
more
respectable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
will
come
to
me
and
I
shall
be
your
gentleman
,
''
said
*NL*
Newman
;
``
that
will
be
more
respectable
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
rose
,
with
lowered
eyes
,
and
stood
a
moment
;
then
,
looking
*NL*
up
,
she
rested
her
eyes
upon
Newman
's
face
.
The
disordered
proprieties
*NL*
were
somehow
settling
to
rest
.
She
looked
at
Newman
so
long
and
so
*NL*
fixedly
,
with
such
a
dull
,
intense
devotedness
,
that
he
himself
might
*NL*
have
had
a
pretext
for
embarrassment
.
At
last
she
said
gently
,
``
You
are
*NL*
not
looking
well
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
natural
enough
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
have
nothing
to
feel
well
*NL*
about
.
To
be
very
indifferent
and
very
fierce
,
very
dull
and
very
*NL*
jovial
,
very
sick
and
very
lively
,
all
at
once
,
--
why
,
it
rather
mixes
*NL*
one
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
gave
a
noiseless
sigh
.
``
I
can
tell
you
something
that
will
*NL*
make
you
feel
duller
still
,
if
you
want
to
feel
all
one
way
.
About
*NL*
Madame
de
Cintre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
tell
me
?
''
Newman
demanded
.
``
Not
that
you
have
seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
``
No
,
indeed
,
sir
,
nor
ever
shall
.
That
's
the
*NL*
dullness
of
it
.
Nor
my
lady
.
Nor
M.
de
Bellegarde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
that
she
is
kept
so
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Close
,
close
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
,
for
an
instant
,
seemed
to
check
the
beating
of
Newman
's
*NL*
heart
.
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
staring
up
at
the
old
woman
.
``
They
*NL*
have
tried
to
see
her
,
and
she
would
n't
--
she
could
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
refused
--
forever
!
I
had
it
from
my
lady
's
own
maid
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
,
``
who
had
it
from
my
lady

To
speak
of
it
to
such
a
person
my
lady
*NL*

have
felt
the
shock
.
Madame
de
Cintre
wo
n't
see
them
now
,
and
now
*NL*
is
her
only
chance

A
while
hence
she
will
have
no
chance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
other
women

the
mothers
,
the
daughters

the
sisters
;
what
*NL*
is
it
they
call
them
?
--
wo
n't
let
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
what
they
call
the
rule
of
the
house
,

or
of
the
order
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
There
is
no
rule
so
strict
as
that
of
the
*NL*
Carmelites
.
The
bad
women
in
the
reformatories
are
fine
ladies
to
them
.
*NL*
They
wear
old
brown
cloaks
--
so
the
femme
de
chambre
told
me
--
that
you
*NL*
would
n't
use
for
a
horse
blanket
.
And
the
poor
countess
was
so
fond
of
*NL*
soft-feeling
dresses
;
she
would
never
have
anything
stiff
!
They
sleep
on
*NL*
the
ground

Mrs.
Bread
went
on
;
``
they
are
no
better
,
no
better
,
''
--
and
*NL*
she
hesitated
for
a
comparison
,
--
``
they
are
no
better
than
tinkers

*NL*
wives
.
They
give
up
everything
,
down
to
the
very
name
their
poor
old
*NL*
nurses
called
them
by
.
They
give
up
father
and
mother
,
brother
and
*NL*
sister
,
--
to
say
nothing
of
other
persons
,
''
Mrs.
Bread
delicately
added
.
*NL*
``
They
wear
a
shroud
under
their
brown
cloaks
and
a
rope
round
their
*NL*
waists
,
and
they
get
up
on
winter
nights
and
go
off
into
cold
places
to
*NL*
pray
to
the
Virgin
Mary
.
The
Virgin
Mary
is
a
hard
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
,
dwelling
on
these
terrible
facts
,
sat
dry-eyed
and
pale
,
*NL*
with
her
hands
clasped
in
her
satin
lap
.
Newman
gave
a
melancholy
*NL*
groan
and
fell
forward
,
leaning
his
head
on
his
hands
.
There
was
a
long
*NL*
silence
,
broken
only
by
the
ticking
of
the
great
gilded
clock
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
this
place
--
where
is
the
convent
?
''
Newman
asked
at
last
,
*NL*
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
houses
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
``
I
found
out
;
I
thought
you
*NL*
would
like
to
know
--
though
it
's
poor
comfort
,
I
think
.
One
is
in
the
*NL*
Avenue
de
Messine
;
they
have
learned
that
Madame
de
Cintre
is
there
.
The
*NL*
other
is
in
the
Rue
d'Enfer
.
That
's
a
terrible
name
;
I
suppose
you
know
*NL*
what
it
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
got
up
and
walked
away
to
the
end
of
his
long
room
.
When
he
came
*NL*
back
Mrs.
Bread
had
got
up
,
and
stood
by
the
fire
with
folded
hands
.
*NL*
``
Tell
me
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
Can
I
get
near
her
--
even
if
I
do
n't
see
her
?
*NL*
Can
I
look
through
a
grating
,
or
some
such
thing
,
at
the
place
where
she
*NL*
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
said
that
all
women
love
a
lover
,
and
Mrs.
Bread
's
sense
of
the
*NL*
pre-established
harmony
which
kept
servants
in
their
``
place
,
''
even
*NL*
as
planets
in
their
orbits
-LRB-
not
that
Mrs.
Bread
had
ever
consciously
*NL*
likened
herself
to
a
planet
-RRB-
,
barely
availed
to
temper
the
maternal
*NL*
melancholy
with
which
she
leaned
her
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
*NL*
her
new
employer
.
She
probably
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
,
forty
years
*NL*
before
,
she
had
held
him
also
in
her
arms
.
``
That

.
*NL*
It
would
only
make
her
seem
farther
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
there
,
at
all
events
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Avenue
de
Messine
,
*NL*
you
say
?
And
what
is
it
they
call
themselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carmelites
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
remember
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bread
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
It
's
my
duty
to
tell
you
*NL*
this
,
sir
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
The
convent
has
a
chapel
,
and
some
people
are
*NL*
admitted
on
Sunday
to
the
Mass.
.
You
do
n't
see
the
poor
creatures
that
*NL*
are
shut
up
there
,
but
I
am
told
you
can
hear
them
sing
.
It
's
a
wonder
*NL*
they
have
any
heart
for
singing
!
Some
Sunday
I
shall
make
bold
to
go
.
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
I
should
know
her
voice
in
fifty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
his
visitor
very
gratefully
;
then
he
held
out
his
hand
*NL*
and
shook
hers
.
``
Thank
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
any
one
can
get
in
,
I
will
.
''
*NL*
A
moment
later
Mrs.
Bread
proposed
,
deferentially
,
to
retire
,
but
he
*NL*
checked
her
and
put
a
lighted
candle
into
her
hand
.
``
There
are
half
a
*NL*
dozen
rooms
there
I
do
n't
use
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
through
an
open
door
.
*NL*
``
Go
and
look
at
them
and
take
your
choice
.
You
can
live
in
the
one
*NL*
you
like
best
.
''
From
this
bewildering
opportunity
Mrs.
Bread
at
first
*NL*
recoiled
;
but
finally
,
yielding
to
Newman
's
gentle
,
reassuring
push
,
she
*NL*
wandered
off
into
the
dusk
with
her
tremulous
taper
.
She
remained
absent
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
during
which
Newman
paced
up
and
down
,
stopped
*NL*
occasionally
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
lights
on
the
Boulevard
,
*NL*
and
then
resumed
his
walk
.
Mrs.
Bread
's
relish
for
her
investigation
*NL*
apparently
increased
as
she
proceeded
;
but
at
last
she
reappeared
and
*NL*
deposited
her
candlestick
on
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
picked
one
out
?
''
asked
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
room
,
sir
?
They
are
all
too
fine
for
a
dingy
old
body
like
me
.
There
*NL*
is
n't
one
that
has
n't
a
bit
of
gilding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
tinsel
,
Mrs.
Bread
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
If
you
stay
there
a
while
*NL*
it
will
all
peel
off
of
itself
.
''
And
he
gave
a
dismal
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
there
are
things
enough
peeling
off
already
!
''
rejoined
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
,
with
a
head-shake
.
``
Since
I
was
there
I
thought
I
would
look
*NL*
about
me
.
I
do
n't
believe
you
know
,
sir
.
The
corners
are
most
dreadful
.
*NL*
You
do
want
a
housekeeper
,
that
you
do
;
you
want
a
tidy
Englishwoman
*NL*
that
is
n't
above
taking
hold
of
a
broom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
assured
her
that
he
suspected
,
if
he
had
not
measured
,
his
*NL*
domestic
abuses
,
and
that
to
reform
them
was
a
mission
worthy
of
her
*NL*
powers
.
She
held
her
candlestick
aloft
again
and
looked
around
the
salon
*NL*
with
compassionate
glances
;
then
she
intimated
that
she
accepted
the
*NL*
mission
,
and
that
its
sacred
character
would
sustain
her
in
her
rupture
*NL*
with
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
With
this
she
curtsied
herself
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
back
the
next
day
with
her
worldly
goods
,
and
Newman
,
going
*NL*
into
his
drawing-room
,
found
her
upon
her
aged
knees
before
a
divan
,
*NL*
sewing
up
some
detached
fringe
.
He
questioned
her
as
to
her
leave-taking
*NL*
with
her
late
mistress
,
and
she
said
it
had
proved
easier
than
she
*NL*
feared
.
``
I
was
perfectly
civil
,
sir
,
but
the
Lord
helped
me
to
remember
*NL*
that
a
good
woman
has
no
call
to
tremble
before
a
bad
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
And
does
she
know
you
have
come
to
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
asked
me
where
I
was
going
,
and
I
mentioned
your
name
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
she
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looked
at
me
very
hard
,
and
she
turned
very
red
.
Then
she
bade
me
*NL*
leave
her
.
I
was
all
ready
to
go
,
and
I
had
got
the
coachman
,
who
is
an
*NL*
Englishman
,
to
bring
down
my
poor
box
and
to
fetch
me
a
cab
.
But
when
I
*NL*
went
down
myself
to
the
gate
I
found
it
closed
.
My
lady
had
sent
orders
*NL*
to
the
porter
not
to
let
me
pass
,
and
by
the
same
orders
the
porter
's
*NL*
wife
--
she
is
a
dreadful
sly
old
body
--
had
gone
out
in
a
cab
to
fetch
*NL*
home
M.
de
Bellegarde
from
his
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
slapped
his
knee
.
``
She
IS
scared
!
she
IS
scared
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
exultantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
frightened
too
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bread
,
``
but
I
was
also
mightily
*NL*
vexed
.
I
took
it
very
high
with
the
porter
and
asked
him
by
what
right
*NL*
he
used
violence
to
an
honorable
Englishwoman
who
had
lived
in
the
house
*NL*
for
thirty
years
before
he
was
heard
of
.
Oh
,
sir
,
I
was
very
grand
,
and
*NL*
I
brought
the
man
down
.
He
drew
his
bolts
and
let
me
out
,
and
I
promised
*NL*
the
cabman
something
handsome
if
he
would
drive
fast
.
But
he
was
*NL*
terribly
slow
;
it
seemed
as
if
we
should
never
reach
your
blessed
door
.
*NL*
I
am
all
of
a
tremble
still
;
it
took
me
five
minutes
,
just
now
,
to
*NL*
thread
my
needle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
told
her
,
with
a
gleeful
laugh
,
that
if
she
chose
she
might
*NL*
have
a
little
maid
on
purpose
to
thread
her
needles
;
and
he
went
away
*NL*
murmuring
to
himself
again
that
the
old
woman
WAS
scared
--
she
WAS
*NL*
scared
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
shown
Mrs.
Tristram
the
little
paper
that
he
carried
in
*NL*
his
pocket-book
,
but
since
his
return
to
Paris
he
had
seen
her
several
*NL*
times
,
and
she
had
told
him
that
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
a
strange
*NL*
way
--
an
even
stranger
way
than
his
sad
situation
made
natural
.
Had
his
*NL*
disappointment
gone
to
his
head
?
He
looked
like
a
man
who
was
going
to
*NL*
be
ill
,
and
yet
she
had
never
seen
him
more
restless
and
active
.
One
day
*NL*
he
would
sit
hanging
his
head
and
looking
as
if
he
were
firmly
resolved
*NL*
never
to
smile
again
;
another
he
would
indulge
in
laughter
that
was
*NL*
almost
unseemly
and
make
jokes
that
were
bad
even
for
him
.
If
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
carry
off
his
sorrow
,
he
at
such
times
really
went
too
far
.
*NL*
She
begged
him
of
all
things
not
to
be
``
strange
.
''
Feeling
in
a
measure
*NL*
responsible
as
she
did
for
the
affair
which
had
turned
out
so
ill
*NL*
for
him
,
she
could
endure
anything
but
his
strangeness
.
He
might
be
*NL*
melancholy
if
he
would
,
or
he
might
be
stoical
;
he
might
be
cross
and
*NL*
cantankerous
with
her
and
ask
her
why
she
had
ever
dared
to
meddle
*NL*
with
his
destiny
:
to
this
she
would
submit
;
for
this
she
would
make
*NL*
allowances
.
Only
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
let
him
not
be
incoherent
.
That
*NL*
would
be
extremely
unpleasant
.
It
was
like
people
talking
in
their
*NL*
sleep
;
they
always
frightened
her
.
And
Mrs.
Tristram
intimated
that
,
*NL*
taking
very
high
ground
as
regards
the
moral
obligation
which
events
*NL*
had
laid
upon
her
,
she
proposed
not
to
rest
quiet
until
she
should
have
*NL*
confronted
him
with
the
least
inadequate
substitute
for
Madame
de
Cintre
*NL*
that
the
two
hemispheres
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
we
are
even
now
,
and
we
had
better
not
open
a
new
*NL*
account
!
You
may
bury
me
some
day
,
but
you
shall
never
marry
me
.
It
's
*NL*
too
rough
.
I
hope
,
at
any
rate
,
''
he
added
,
``
that
there
is
nothing
*NL*
incoherent
in
this
--
that
I
want
to
go
next
Sunday
to
the
Carmelite
*NL*
chapel
in
the
Avenue
de
Messine
.
You
know
one
of
the
Catholic
*NL*
ministers
--
an
abbe
,
is
that
it
?
--
I
have
seen
him
here
,
you
know
;
that
*NL*
motherly
old
gentleman
with
the
big
waist-band
.
Please
ask
him
if
I
need
*NL*
a
special
leave
to
go
in
,
and
if
I
do
,
beg
him
to
obtain
it
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
gave
expression
to
the
liveliest
joy
.
``
I
am
so
glad
you
*NL*
have
asked
me
to
do
something
!
''
she
cried
.
``
You
shall
get
into
the
*NL*
chapel
if
the
abbe
is
disfrocked
for
his
share
in
it
.
''
And
two
days
*NL*
afterwards
she
told
him
that
it
was
all
arranged
;
the
abbe
was
enchanted
*NL*
to
serve
him
,
and
if
he
would
present
himself
civilly
at
the
convent
*NL*
gate
there
would
be
no
difficulty
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
was
as
yet
two
days
off
;
but
meanwhile
,
to
beguile
his
*NL*
impatience
,
Newman
took
his
way
to
the
Avenue
de
Messine
and
got
*NL*
what
comfort
he
could
in
staring
at
the
blank
outer
wall
of
Madame
de
*NL*
Cintre
's
present
residence
.
The
street
in
question
,
as
some
travelers
*NL*
will
remember
,
adjoins
the
Parc
Monceau
,
which
is
one
of
the
prettiest
*NL*
corners
of
Paris
.
The
quarter
has
an
air
of
modern
opulence
and
*NL*
convenience
which
seems
at
variance
with
the
ascetic
institution
,
*NL*
and
the
impression
made
upon
Newman
's
gloomily-irritated
gaze
by
the
*NL*
fresh-looking
,
windowless
expanse
behind
which
the
woman
he
loved
was
*NL*
perhaps
even
then
pledging
herself
to
pass
the
rest
of
her
days
was
less
*NL*
exasperating
than
he
had
feared
.
The
place
suggested
a
convent
with
the
*NL*
modern
improvements
--
an
asylum
in
which
privacy
,
though
unbroken
,
*NL*
might
be
not
quite
identical
with
privation
,
and
meditation
,
though
*NL*
monotonous
,
might
be
of
a
cheerful
cast
.
And
yet
he
knew
the
case
was
*NL*
otherwise
;
only
at
present
it
was
not
a
reality
to
him
.
It
was
too
*NL*
strange
and
too
mocking
to
be
real
;
it
was
like
a
page
torn
out
of
a
*NL*
romance
,
with
no
context
in
his
own
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
morning
,
at
the
hour
which
Mrs.
Tristram
had
indicated
,
he
*NL*
rang
at
the
gate
in
the
blank
wall
.
It
instantly
opened
and
admitted
*NL*
him
into
a
clean
,
cold-looking
court
,
from
beyond
which
a
dull
,
plain
*NL*
edifice
looked
down
upon
him
.
A
robust
lay
sister
with
a
cheerful
*NL*
complexion
emerged
from
a
porter
's
lodge
,
and
,
on
his
stating
his
*NL*
errand
,
pointed
to
the
open
door
of
the
chapel
,
an
edifice
which
*NL*
occupied
the
right
side
of
the
court
and
was
preceded
by
the
high
flight
*NL*
of
steps
.
Newman
ascended
the
steps
and
immediately
entered
the
open
*NL*
door
.
Service
had
not
yet
begun
;
the
place
was
dimly
lighted
,
and
it
was
*NL*
some
moments
before
he
could
distinguish
its
features
.
Then
he
saw
it
*NL*
was
divided
by
a
large
close
iron
screen
into
two
unequal
portions
.
*NL*
The
altar
was
on
the
hither
side
of
the
screen
,
and
between
it
and
the
*NL*
entrance
were
disposed
several
benches
and
chairs
.
Three
or
four
of
*NL*
these
were
occupied
by
vague
,
motionless
figures
--
figures
that
he
*NL*
presently
perceived
to
be
women
,
deeply
absorbed
in
their
devotion
.
The
*NL*
place
seemed
to
Newman
very
cold
;
the
smell
of
the
incense
itself
was
*NL*
cold
.
Besides
this
there
was
a
twinkle
of
tapers
and
here
and
there
a
*NL*
glow
of
colored
glass
.
Newman
seated
himself
;
the
praying
women
kept
*NL*
still
,
with
their
backs
turned
.
He
saw
they
were
visitors
like
himself
*NL*
and
he
would
have
liked
to
see
their
faces
;
for
he
believed
that
they
*NL*
were
the
mourning
mothers
and
sisters
of
other
women
who
had
had
the
*NL*
same
pitiless
courage
as
Madame
de
Cintre
.
But
they
were
better
off
*NL*
than
he
,
for
they
at
least
shared
the
faith
to
which
the
others
had
*NL*
sacrificed
themselves
.
Three
or
four
persons
came
in
;
two
of
them
were
*NL*
elderly
gentlemen
.
Every
one
was
very
quiet
.
Newman
fastened
his
*NL*
eyes
upon
the
screen
behind
the
altar
.
That
was
the
convent
,
the
real
*NL*
convent
,
the
place
where
she
was
.
But
he
could
see
nothing
;
no
light
*NL*
came
through
the
crevices
.
He
got
up
and
approached
the
partition
very
*NL*
gently
,
trying
to
look
through
.
But
behind
it
there
was
darkness
,
with
*NL*
nothing
stirring
.
He
went
back
to
his
place
,
and
after
that
a
priest
*NL*
and
two
altar
boys
came
in
and
began
to
say
mass
.
Newman
watched
their
*NL*
genuflections
and
gyrations
with
a
grim
,
still
enmity
;
they
seemed
aids
*NL*
and
abettors
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
desertion
;
they
were
mouthing
and
*NL*
droning
out
their
triumph
.
The
priest
's
long
,
dismal
intonings
acted
*NL*
upon
his
nerves
and
deepened
his
wrath
;
there
was
something
defiant
in
*NL*
his
unintelligible
drawl
;
it
seemed
meant
for
Newman
himself
.
Suddenly
*NL*
there
arose
from
the
depths
of
the
chapel
,
from
behind
the
inexorable
*NL*
grating
,
a
sound
which
drew
his
attention
from
the
altar
--
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
strange
,
lugubrious
chant
,
uttered
by
women
's
voices
.
It
began
softly
,
*NL*
but
it
presently
grew
louder
,
and
as
it
increased
it
became
more
of
a
*NL*
wail
and
a
dirge
.
It
was
the
chant
of
the
Carmelite
nuns
,
their
only
*NL*
human
utterance
.
It
was
their
dirge
over
their
buried
affections
*NL*
and
over
the
vanity
of
earthly
desires
.
At
first
Newman
was
*NL*
bewildered
--
almost
stunned
--
by
the
strangeness
of
the
sound
;
then
,
as
*NL*
he
comprehended
its
meaning
,
he
listened
intently
and
his
heart
began
to
*NL*
throb
.
He
listened
for
Madame
de
Cintre
's
voice
,
and
in
the
very
heart
*NL*
of
the
tuneless
harmony
he
imagined
he
made
it
out
.
-LRB-
We
are
obliged
to
*NL*
believe
that
he
was
wrong
,
inasmuch
as
she
had
obviously
not
yet
had
*NL*
time
to
become
a
member
of
the
invisible
sisterhood
.
-RRB-
The
chant
kept
*NL*
on
,
mechanical
and
monotonous
,
with
dismal
repetitions
and
despairing
*NL*
cadences
.
It
was
hideous
,
it
was
horrible
;
as
it
continued
,
Newman
felt
*NL*
that
he
needed
all
his
self-control
.
He
was
growing
more
agitated
;
he
*NL*
felt
tears
in
his
eyes
.
At
last
,
as
in
its
full
force
the
thought
came
*NL*
over
him
that
this
confused
,
impersonal
wail
was
all
that
either
he
or
*NL*
the
world
she
had
deserted
should
ever
hear
of
the
voice
he
had
found
*NL*
so
sweet
,
he
felt
that
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
.
He
rose
abruptly
*NL*
and
made
his
way
out
.
On
the
threshold
he
paused
,
listened
again
to
the
*NL*
dreary
strain
,
and
then
hastily
descended
into
the
court
.
As
he
did
*NL*
so
he
saw
the
good
sister
with
the
high-colored
cheeks
and
the
fanlike
*NL*
frill
to
her
coiffure
,
who
had
admitted
him
,
was
in
conference
at
the
*NL*
gate
with
two
persons
who
had
just
come
in
.
A
second
glance
informed
him
*NL*
that
these
persons
were
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
,
and
that
they
*NL*
were
about
to
avail
themselves
of
that
method
of
approach
to
Madame
*NL*
de
Cintre
which
Newman
had
found
but
a
mockery
of
consolation
.
As
he
*NL*
crossed
the
court
M.
de
Bellegarde
recognized
him
;
the
marquis
was
*NL*
coming
to
the
steps
,
leading
his
mother
.
The
old
lady
also
gave
Newman
*NL*
a
look
,
and
it
resembled
that
of
her
son
.
Both
faces
expressed
a
franker
*NL*
perturbation
,
something
more
akin
to
the
humbleness
of
dismay
,
than
*NL*
Newman
had
yet
seen
in
them
.
Evidently
he
startled
the
Bellegardes
,
and
*NL*
they
had
not
their
grand
behavior
immediately
in
hand
.
Newman
hurried
*NL*
past
them
,
guided
only
by
the
desire
to
get
out
of
the
convent
walls
and
*NL*
into
the
street
.
The
gate
opened
itself
at
his
approach
;
he
strode
over
*NL*
the
threshold
and
it
closed
behind
him
.
A
carriage
which
appeared
to
*NL*
have
been
standing
there
,
was
just
turning
away
from
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
,
blankly
;
then
he
became
conscious
,
*NL*
through
the
dusky
mist
that
swam
before
his
eyes
,
that
a
lady
seated
in
*NL*
it
was
bowing
to
him
.
The
vehicle
had
turned
away
before
he
recognized
*NL*
her
;
it
was
an
ancient
landau
with
one
half
the
cover
lowered
.
The
*NL*
lady
's
bow
was
very
positive
and
accompanied
with
a
smile
;
a
little
girl
*NL*
was
seated
beside
her
.
He
raised
his
hat
,
and
then
the
lady
bade
the
*NL*
coachman
stop
.
The
carriage
halted
again
beside
the
pavement
,
and
she
*NL*
sat
there
and
beckoned
to
Newman
--
beckoned
with
the
demonstrative
grace
*NL*
of
Madame
Urbain
de
Bellegarde
.
Newman
hesitated
a
moment
before
*NL*
he
obeyed
her
summons
,
during
this
moment
he
had
time
to
curse
his
*NL*
stupidity
for
letting
the
others
escape
him
.
He
had
been
wondering
how
*NL*
he
could
get
at
them
;
fool
that
he
was
for
not
stopping
them
then
and
*NL*
there
!
What
better
place
than
beneath
the
very
prison
walls
to
which
*NL*
they
had
consigned
the
promise
of
his
joy
?
He
had
been
too
bewildered
*NL*
to
stop
them
,
but
now
he
felt
ready
to
wait
for
them
at
the
gate
.
Madame
*NL*
Urbain
,
with
a
certain
attractive
petulance
,
beckoned
to
him
again
,
and
*NL*
this
time
he
went
over
to
the
carriage
.
She
leaned
out
and
gave
him
her
*NL*
hand
,
looking
at
him
kindly
,
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
monsieur
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
do
n't
include
me
in
your
wrath
?
I
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
suppose
YOU
could
have
prevented
it
!
''
Newman
answered
in
a
*NL*
tone
which
was
not
that
of
studied
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
is
too
true
for
me
to
resent
the
small
account
it
makes
of
*NL*
my
influence
.
I
forgive
you
,
at
any
rate
,
because
you
look
as
if
you
had
*NL*
seen
a
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
!
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
then
,
I
did
n't
go
in
with
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
my
*NL*
husband
.
You
must
have
seen
them
,
eh
?
Was
the
meeting
affectionate
?
*NL*
Did
you
hear
the
chanting
?
They
say
it
's
like
the
lamentations
of
the
*NL*
damned
.
I
would
n't
go
in
:
one
is
certain
to
hear
that
soon
enough
.
Poor
*NL*
Claire
--
in
a
white
shroud
and
a
big
brown
cloak
!
That
's
the
toilette
*NL*
of
the
Carmelites
,
you
know
.
Well
,
she
was
always
fond
of
long
,
loose
*NL*
things
.
But
I
must
not
speak
of
her
to
you
;
only
I
must
say
that
I
am
*NL*
very
sorry
for
you
,
that
if
I
could
have
helped
you
I
would
,
and
that
*NL*
I
think
every
one
has
been
very
shabby
.
I
was
afraid
of
it
,
you
know
;
I
*NL*
felt
it
in
the
air
for
a
fortnight
before
it
came
.
When
I
saw
you
at
*NL*
my
mother-in-law
's
ball
,
taking
it
all
so
easily
,
I
felt
as
if
you
were
*NL*
dancing
on
your
grave
.
But
what
could
I
do
?
I
wish
you
all
the
good
I
*NL*
can
think
of
.
You
will
say
that
is
n't
much
!
Yes
;
they
have
been
very
*NL*
shabby
;
I
am
not
a
bit
afraid
to
say
it
;
I
assure
you
every
one
thinks
*NL*
so
.
We
are
not
all
like
that
.
I
am
sorry
I
am
not
going
to
see
you
*NL*
again
;
you
know
I
think
you
very
good
company
.
I
would
prove
it
by
*NL*
asking
you
to
get
into
the
carriage
and
drive
with
me
for
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
while
I
wait
for
my
mother-in-law
.
Only
if
we
were
*NL*
seen
--
considering
what
has
passed
,
and
every
one
knows
you
have
been
*NL*
turned
away
--
it
might
be
thought
I
was
going
a
little
too
far
,
even
for
*NL*
me
.
But
I
shall
see
you
sometimes
--
somewhere
,
eh
?
You
know
''
--
this
was
*NL*
said
in
English
--
``
we
have
a
plan
for
a
little
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stood
there
with
his
hand
on
the
carriage-door
listening
to
this
*NL*
consolatory
murmur
with
an
unlighted
eye
.
He
hardly
knew
what
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
was
saying
;
he
was
only
conscious
that
she
was
chattering
*NL*
ineffectively
.
But
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
,
with
her
pretty
*NL*
professions
,
there
was
a
way
of
making
her
effective
;
she
might
help
*NL*
him
to
get
at
the
old
woman
and
the
marquis
.
``
They
are
coming
back
*NL*
soon
--
your
companions
?
''
he
said
.
``
You
are
waiting
for
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
hear
the
mass
out
;
there
is
nothing
to
keep
them
longer
.
*NL*
Claire
has
refused
to
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
speak
to
them
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
and
you
can
help
me
,
you
can
do
*NL*
me
a
favor
.
Delay
your
return
for
five
minutes
and
give
me
a
chance
at
*NL*
them
.
I
will
wait
for
them
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
clasped
her
hands
with
a
tender
grimace
.
``
My
poor
*NL*
friend
,
what
do
you
want
to
do
to
them
?
To
beg
them
to
come
back
to
you
?
*NL*
It
will
be
wasted
words
.
They
will
never
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
speak
to
them
,
all
the
same
.
Pray
do
what
I
ask
you
.
Stay
*NL*
away
and
leave
them
to
me
for
five
minutes
;
you
need
n't
be
afraid
;
I
*NL*
shall
not
be
violent
;
I
am
very
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
look
very
quiet
!
If
they
had
le
coeur
tendre
you
would
move
*NL*
them
.
But
they
have
n't
!
However
,
I
will
do
better
for
you
than
what
you
*NL*
propose
.
The
understanding
is
not
that
I
shall
come
back
for
them
.
I
am
*NL*
going
into
the
Parc
Monceau
with
my
little
girl
to
give
her
a
walk
,
and
*NL*
my
mother-in-law
,
who
comes
so
rarely
into
this
quarter
,
is
to
profit
*NL*
by
the
same
opportunity
to
take
the
air
.
We
are
to
wait
for
her
in
the
*NL*
park
,
where
my
husband
is
to
bring
her
to
us
.
Follow
me
now
;
just
within
*NL*
the
gates
I
shall
get
out
of
my
carriage
.
Sit
down
on
a
chair
in
some
*NL*
quiet
corner
and
I
will
bring
them
near
you
.
There
's
devotion
for
you
!
*NL*
Le
reste
vous
regarde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
proposal
seemed
to
Newman
extremely
felicitous
;
it
revived
his
*NL*
drooping
spirit
,
and
he
reflected
that
Madame
Urbain
was
not
such
a
*NL*
goose
as
she
seemed
.
He
promised
immediately
to
overtake
her
,
and
the
*NL*
carriage
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Parc
Monceau
is
a
very
pretty
piece
of
landscape-gardening
,
but
*NL*
Newman
,
passing
into
it
,
bestowed
little
attention
upon
its
elegant
*NL*
vegetation
,
which
was
full
of
the
freshness
of
spring
.
He
found
Madame
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
promptly
,
seated
in
one
of
the
quiet
corners
of
which
she
*NL*
had
spoken
,
while
before
her
,
in
the
alley
,
her
little
girl
,
attended
by
*NL*
the
footman
and
the
lap-dog
,
walked
up
and
down
as
if
she
were
taking
a
*NL*
lesson
in
deportment
.
Newman
sat
down
beside
the
mamma
,
and
she
talked
*NL*
a
great
deal
,
apparently
with
the
design
of
convincing
him
that
--
if
*NL*
he
would
only
see
it
--
poor
dear
Claire
did
not
belong
to
the
most
*NL*
fascinating
type
of
woman
.
She
was
too
tall
and
thin
,
too
stiff
and
*NL*
cold
;
her
mouth
was
too
wide
and
her
nose
too
narrow
.
She
had
no
dimples
*NL*
anywhere
.
And
then
she
was
eccentric
,
eccentric
in
cold
blood
;
she
was
*NL*
an
Anglaise
,
after
all
.
Newman
was
very
impatient
;
he
was
counting
the
*NL*
minutes
until
his
victims
should
reappear
.
He
sat
silent
,
leaning
upon
*NL*
his
cane
,
looking
absently
and
insensibly
at
the
little
marquise
.
At
*NL*
length
Madame
de
Bellegarde
said
she
would
walk
toward
the
gate
of
the
*NL*
park
and
meet
her
companions
;
but
before
she
went
she
dropped
her
eyes
,
*NL*
and
,
after
playing
a
moment
with
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
,
looked
up
again
*NL*
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
,
''
she
asked
,
``
the
promise
you
made
me
three
weeks
*NL*
ago
?
''
And
then
,
as
Newman
,
vainly
consulting
his
memory
,
was
obliged
to
*NL*
confess
that
the
promise
had
escaped
it
,
she
declared
that
he
had
made
*NL*
her
,
at
the
time
,
a
very
queer
answer
--
an
answer
at
which
,
viewing
it
*NL*
in
the
light
of
the
sequel
,
she
had
fair
ground
for
taking
offense
.
*NL*
``
You
promised
to
take
me
to
Bullier
's
after
your
marriage
.
After
your
*NL*
marriage
--
you
made
a
great
point
of
that
.
Three
days
after
that
your
*NL*
marriage
was
broken
off
.
Do
you
know
,
when
I
heard
the
news
,
the
*NL*
first
thing
I
said
to
myself
?
`
Oh
heaven
,
now
he
wo
n't
go
with
me
to
*NL*
Bullier
's
!
'
And
I
really
began
to
wonder
if
you
had
not
been
expecting
*NL*
the
rupture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
lady
,
''
murmured
Newman
,
looking
down
the
path
to
see
if
the
*NL*
others
were
not
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
good-natured
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
``
One
must
not
ask
*NL*
too
much
of
a
gentleman
who
is
in
love
with
a
cloistered
nun
.
Besides
,
*NL*
I
ca
n't
go
to
Bullier
's
while
we
are
in
mourning
.
But
I
have
n't
given
it
*NL*
up
for
that
.
The
partie
is
arranged
;
I
have
my
cavalier
.
Lord
Deepmere
,
*NL*
if
you
please
!
He
has
gone
back
to
his
dear
Dublin
;
but
a
few
months
*NL*
hence
I
am
to
name
any
evening
and
he
will
come
over
from
Ireland
,
on
*NL*
purpose
.
That
's
what
I
call
gallantry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
this
Madame
de
Bellegarde
walked
away
with
her
little
*NL*
girl
.
Newman
sat
in
his
place
;
the
time
seemed
terribly
long
.
He
felt
*NL*
how
fiercely
his
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
convent
chapel
had
raked
*NL*
over
the
glowing
coals
of
his
resentment
.
Madame
de
Bellegarde
kept
him
*NL*
waiting
,
but
she
proved
as
good
as
her
word
.
At
last
she
reappeared
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
path
,
with
her
little
girl
and
her
footman
;
beside
her
*NL*
slowly
walked
her
husband
,
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
.
They
were
a
long
*NL*
time
advancing
,
during
which
Newman
sat
unmoved
.
Tingling
as
he
was
*NL*
with
passion
,
it
was
extremely
characteristic
of
him
that
he
was
able
*NL*
to
moderate
his
expression
of
it
,
as
he
would
have
turned
down
a
flaring
*NL*
gas-burner
.
His
native
coolness
,
shrewdness
,
and
deliberateness
,
his
*NL*
life-long
submissiveness
to
the
sentiment
that
words
were
acts
and
acts
*NL*
were
steps
in
life
,
and
that
in
this
matter
of
taking
steps
*NL*
curveting
and
prancing
were
exclusively
reserved
for
quadrupeds
*NL*
and
foreigners
--
all
this
admonished
him
that
rightful
wrath
had
no
*NL*
connection
with
being
a
fool
and
indulging
in
spectacular
violence
.
So
*NL*
as
he
rose
,
when
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
and
her
son
were
close
to
*NL*
him
,
he
only
felt
very
tall
and
light
.
He
had
been
sitting
beside
some
*NL*
shrubbery
,
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
be
noticeable
at
a
distance
;
but
M.
*NL*
de
Bellegarde
had
evidently
already
perceived
him
.
His
mother
and
he
*NL*
were
holding
their
course
,
but
Newman
stepped
in
front
of
them
,
and
they
*NL*
were
obliged
to
pause
.
He
lifted
his
hat
slightly
,
and
looked
at
them
*NL*
for
a
moment
;
they
were
pale
with
amazement
and
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
for
stopping
you
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
tone
,
``
but
I
must
profit
*NL*
by
the
occasion
.
I
have
ten
words
to
say
to
you
.
Will
you
listen
to
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
glared
at
him
and
then
turned
to
his
mother
.
``
Can
Mr.
Newman
*NL*
possibly
have
anything
to
say
that
is
worth
our
listening
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
have
something
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
besides
,
it
is
my
duty
to
*NL*
say
it
.
It
's
a
notification
--
a
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
duty
?
''
said
old
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
her
thin
lips
curving
like
*NL*
scorched
paper
.
``
That
is
your
affair
,
not
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Urbain
meanwhile
had
seized
her
little
girl
by
the
hand
,
with
a
*NL*
gesture
of
surprise
and
impatience
which
struck
Newman
,
intent
as
he
was
*NL*
upon
his
own
words
,
with
its
dramatic
effectiveness
.
``
If
Mr.
Newman
is
*NL*
going
to
make
a
scene
in
public
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
will
take
my
poor
*NL*
child
out
of
the
melee
.
She
is
too
young
to
see
such
naughtiness
!
''
and
*NL*
she
instantly
resumed
her
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
much
better
listen
to
me
,
''
Newman
went
on
.
``
Whether
you
do
or
*NL*
not
,
things
will
be
disagreeable
for
you
;
but
at
any
rate
you
will
be
*NL*
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
already
heard
something
of
your
threats
,
''
said
the
marquis
,
*NL*
``
and
you
know
what
we
think
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
a
good
deal
more
than
you
admit
.
A
moment
,
''
Newman
added
in
*NL*
reply
to
an
exclamation
of
the
old
lady
.
``
I
remember
perfectly
that
we
*NL*
are
in
a
public
place
,
and
you
see
I
am
very
quiet
.
I
am
not
going
to
*NL*
tell
your
secret
to
the
passers-by
;
I
shall
keep
it
,
to
begin
with
,
for
*NL*
certain
picked
listeners
.
Any
one
who
observes
us
will
think
that
we
are
*NL*
having
a
friendly
chat
,
and
that
I
am
complimenting
you
,
madam
,
on
your
*NL*
venerable
virtues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
gave
three
short
sharp
raps
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
.
``
I
*NL*
demand
of
you
to
step
out
of
our
path
!
''
he
hissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
instantly
complied
,
and
M.
de
Bellegarde
stepped
forward
with
his
*NL*
mother
.
Then
Newman
said
,
``
Half
an
hour
hence
Madame
de
Bellegarde
will
*NL*
regret
that
she
did
n't
learn
exactly
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquise
had
taken
a
few
steps
,
but
at
these
words
she
paused
,
*NL*
looking
at
Newman
with
eyes
like
two
scintillating
globules
of
ice
.
``
You
*NL*
are
like
a
peddler
with
something
to
sell
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
little
cold
*NL*
laugh
which
only
partially
concealed
the
tremor
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
to
sell
,
''
Newman
rejoined
;
``
I
give
it
to
you
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
And
he
approached
nearer
to
her
,
looking
her
straight
in
the
eyes
.
``
You
*NL*
killed
your
husband
,
''
he
said
,
almost
in
a
whisper
.
``
That
is
,
you
tried
*NL*
once
and
failed
,
and
then
,
without
trying
,
you
succeeded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
closed
her
eyes
and
gave
a
little
cough
,
which
,
as
*NL*
a
piece
of
dissimulation
,
struck
Newman
as
really
heroic
.
``
Dear
mother
,
''
*NL*
said
the
marquis
,
``
does
this
stuff
amuse
you
so
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rest
is
more
amusing
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
You
had
better
not
lose
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
opened
her
eyes
;
the
scintillations
had
gone
out
of
*NL*
them
;
they
were
fixed
and
dead
.
But
she
smiled
superbly
with
her
narrow
*NL*
little
lips
,
and
repeated
Newman
's
word
.
``
Amusing
?
Have
I
killed
some
*NL*
one
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
count
your
daughter
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
though
I
might
!
Your
*NL*
husband
knew
what
you
were
doing
.
I
have
a
proof
of
it
whose
existence
*NL*
you
have
never
suspected
.
''
And
he
turned
to
the
marquis
,
who
was
*NL*
terribly
white
--
whiter
than
Newman
had
ever
seen
any
one
out
of
a
*NL*
picture
.
``
A
paper
written
by
the
hand
,
and
signed
with
the
name
,
of
*NL*
Henri-Urbain
de
Bellegarde
.
Written
after
you
,
madame
,
had
left
him
for
*NL*
dead
,
and
while
you
,
sir
,
had
gone
--
not
very
fast
--
for
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
looked
at
his
mother
;
she
turned
away
,
looking
vaguely
round
*NL*
her
.
``
I
must
sit
down
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
tone
,
going
toward
the
bench
*NL*
on
which
Newman
had
been
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
you
have
spoken
to
me
alone
?
''
said
the
marquis
to
Newman
,
with
*NL*
a
strange
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
if
I
could
have
been
sure
of
speaking
to
your
mother
alone
,
*NL*
too
,
''
Newman
answered
.
``
But
I
have
had
to
take
you
as
I
could
get
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
with
a
movement
very
eloquent
of
what
he
would
*NL*
have
called
her
``
grit
,
''
her
steel-cold
pluck
and
her
instinctive
appeal
*NL*
to
her
own
personal
resources
,
drew
her
hand
out
of
her
son
's
arm
and
*NL*
went
and
seated
herself
upon
the
bench
.
There
she
remained
,
with
her
*NL*
hands
folded
in
her
lap
,
looking
straight
at
Newman
.
The
expression
of
*NL*
her
face
was
such
that
he
fancied
at
first
that
she
was
smiling
;
but
he
*NL*
went
and
stood
in
front
of
her
and
saw
that
her
elegant
features
were
*NL*
distorted
by
agitation
.
He
saw
,
however
,
equally
,
that
she
was
resisting
*NL*
her
agitation
with
all
the
rigor
of
her
inflexible
will
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nothing
like
either
fear
or
submission
in
her
stony
stare
.
She
had
been
*NL*
startled
,
but
she
was
not
terrified
.
Newman
had
an
exasperating
feeling
*NL*
that
she
would
get
the
better
of
him
still
;
he
would
not
have
believed
*NL*
it
possible
that
he
could
so
utterly
fail
to
be
touched
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
a
woman
-LRB-
criminal
or
other
-RRB-
in
so
tight
a
place
.
Madame
de
Bellegarde
*NL*
gave
a
glance
at
her
son
which
seemed
tantamount
to
an
injunction
to
be
*NL*
silent
and
leave
her
to
her
own
devices
.
The
marquis
stood
beside
her
,
*NL*
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
looking
at
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
paper
is
this
you
speak
of
?
''
asked
the
old
lady
,
with
an
imitation
*NL*
of
tranquillity
which
would
have
been
applauded
in
a
veteran
actress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
what
I
have
told
you
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
A
paper
written
by
your
*NL*
husband
after
you
had
left
him
for
dead
,
and
during
the
couple
of
hours
*NL*
before
you
returned
.
You
see
he
had
the
time
;
you
should
n't
have
stayed
*NL*
away
so
long
.
It
declares
distinctly
his
wife
's
murderous
intent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
it
,
''
Madame
de
Bellegarde
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
might
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
and
I
have
taken
a
copy
.
''
And
he
*NL*
drew
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
a
small
,
folded
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
my
son
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
Newman
handed
it
to
the
*NL*
marquis
,
whose
mother
,
glancing
at
him
,
said
simply
,
``
Look
at
it
.
''
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
's
eyes
had
a
pale
eagerness
which
it
was
useless
for
him
to
*NL*
try
to
dissimulate
;
he
took
the
paper
in
his
light-gloved
fingers
and
*NL*
opened
it
.
There
was
a
silence
,
during
which
he
read
it
.
He
had
more
*NL*
than
time
to
read
it
,
but
still
he
said
nothing
;
he
stood
staring
at
it
.
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
original
?
''
asked
Madame
de
Bellegarde
,
in
a
voice
which
*NL*
was
really
a
consummate
negation
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
very
safe
place
.
Of
course
I
ca
n't
show
you
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
You
might
want
to
take
hold
of
it
,
''
he
added
with
conscious
quaintness
.
*NL*
``
But
that
's
a
very
correct
copy
--
except
,
of
course
,
the
handwriting
.
I
*NL*
am
keeping
the
original
to
show
some
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
at
last
looked
up
,
and
his
eyes
were
still
very
eager
.
*NL*
``
To
whom
do
you
mean
to
show
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
thinking
of
beginning
with
the
duchess
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
that
*NL*
stout
lady
I
saw
at
your
ball
.
She
asked
me
to
come
and
see
her
,
you
*NL*
know
.
I
thought
at
the
moment
I
should
n't
have
much
to
say
to
her
;
but
*NL*
my
little
document
will
give
us
something
to
talk
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
keep
it
,
my
son
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
keep
it
and
show
it
to
your
mother
when
*NL*
you
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after
showing
it
to
the
duchess
?
''
--
asked
the
marquis
,
folding
the
*NL*
paper
and
putting
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
take
up
the
dukes
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Then
the
counts
and
the
*NL*
barons
--
all
the
people
you
had
the
cruelty
to
introduce
me
to
in
a
*NL*
character
of
which
you
meant
immediately
to
deprive
me
.
I
have
made
out
*NL*
a
list
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
neither
Madame
de
Bellegarde
nor
her
son
said
a
word
;
the
*NL*
old
lady
sat
with
her
eyes
upon
the
ground
;
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
blanched
*NL*
pupils
were
fixed
upon
her
face
.
Then
,
looking
at
Newman
,
``
Is
that
all
*NL*
you
have
to
say
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
want
to
say
a
few
words
more
.
I
want
to
say
that
I
hope
you
*NL*
quite
understand
what
I
'm
about
.
This
is
my
revenge
,
you
know
.
You
have
*NL*
treated
me
before
the
world
--
convened
for
the
express
purpose
--
as
if
I
*NL*
were
not
good
enough
for
you
.
I
mean
to
show
the
world
that
,
however
bad
*NL*
I
may
be
,
you
are
not
quite
the
people
to
say
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
was
silent
again
,
and
then
she
broke
her
silence
.
*NL*
Her
self-possession
continued
to
be
extraordinary
.
``
I
need
n't
ask
you
*NL*
who
has
been
your
accomplice
.
Mrs.
Bread
told
me
that
you
had
purchased
*NL*
her
services
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
accuse
Mrs.
Bread
of
venality
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
She
has
kept
your
*NL*
secret
all
these
years
.
She
has
given
you
a
long
respite
.
It
was
beneath
*NL*
her
eyes
your
husband
wrote
that
paper
;
he
put
it
into
her
hands
with
*NL*
a
solemn
injunction
that
she
was
to
make
it
public
.
She
was
too
*NL*
good-hearted
to
make
use
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
appeared
for
an
instant
to
hesitate
,
and
then
,
``
She
was
my
*NL*
husband
's
mistress
,
''
she
said
,
softly
.
This
was
the
only
concession
to
*NL*
self-defense
that
she
condescended
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
Bellegarde
got
up
from
her
bench
.
``
It
was
not
to
your
opinions
*NL*
I
undertook
to
listen
,
and
if
you
have
nothing
left
but
them
to
tell
*NL*
me
I
think
this
remarkable
interview
may
terminate
.
''
And
turning
to
the
*NL*
marquis
she
took
his
arm
again
.
``
My
son
,
''
she
said
,
``
say
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
down
at
his
mother
,
passing
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
forehead
,
and
then
,
tenderly
,
caressingly
,
``
What
shall
I
say
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
only
one
thing
to
say
,
''
said
the
Marquise
.
``
That
it
was
really
*NL*
not
worth
while
to
have
interrupted
our
walk

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
marquis
thought
he
could
improve
this
.
``
Your
paper
's
a
forgery
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
shook
his
head
a
little
,
with
a
tranquil
smile
.
``

*NL*
Bellegarde
,
''
he
said
,
``
your
mother
does
better
.
She
has
done
better
all
*NL*
along
,
from
the
first
of
my
knowing
you
.
You
're
a
mighty
plucky
woman
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
he
continued
.
``
It
's
a
great
pity
you
have
made
me
your
enemy
.
I
*NL*
should
have
been
one
of
your
greatest
admirers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
pauvre
ami
,
''
said
Madame
de
Bellegarde
to
her
son
in
French
,
and
*NL*
as
if
she
had
not
heard
these
words
,
``
you
must
take
me
immediately
to
my
*NL*
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stepped
back
and
let
them
leave
him
;
he
watched
them
a
moment
and
*NL*
saw
Madame
Urbain
,
with
her
little
girl
,
come
out
of
a
by-path
to
meet
*NL*
them
.
The
old
lady
stooped
and
kissed
her
grandchild
.
``
Damn
it
,
she
is
*NL*
plucky
!
''
said
Newman
,
and
he
walked
home
with
a
slight
sense
of
being
*NL*
balked
.
She
was
so
inexpressively
defiant
!
But
on
reflection
he
decided
*NL*
that
what
he
had
witnessed
was
no
real
sense
of
security
,
still
less
a
*NL*
real
innocence
.
It
was
only
a
very
superior
style
of
brazen
assurance
.
*NL*
``
Wait
till
she
reads
the
paper
!
''
he
said
to
himself
;
and
he
concluded
*NL*
that
he
should
hear
from
her
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
sooner
than
he
expected
.
The
next
morning
,
before
midday
,
*NL*
when
he
was
about
to
give
orders
for
his
breakfast
to
be
served
,
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
's
card
was
brought
to
him
.
``
She
has
read
the
paper
and
she
*NL*
has
passed
a
bad
night
,
''
said
Newman
.
He
instantly
admitted
his
visitor
,
*NL*
who
came
in
with
the
air
of
the
ambassador
of
a
great
power
meeting
the
*NL*
delegate
of
a
barbarous
tribe
whom
an
absurd
accident
had
enabled
for
*NL*
the
moment
to
be
abominably
annoying
.
The
ambassador
,
at
all
events
,
had
*NL*
passed
a
bad
night
,
and
his
faultlessly
careful
toilet
only
threw
*NL*
into
relief
the
frigid
rancor
in
his
eyes
and
the
mottled
tones
of
his
*NL*
refined
complexion
.
He
stood
before
Newman
a
moment
,
breathing
quickly
*NL*
and
softly
,
and
shaking
his
forefinger
curtly
as
his
host
pointed
to
a
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
have
come
to
say
is
soon
said
,
''
he
declared
``
and
can
only
be
*NL*
said
without
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
good
for
as
much
or
for
as
little
as
you
desire
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
looked
round
the
room
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
On
what
terms
*NL*
will
you
part
with
your
scrap
of
paper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
none
!
''
And
while
Newman
,
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
sounded
the
marquis
's
turbid
gaze
with
his
own
,
he
added
,
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
that
is
not
worth
sitting
down
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
meditated
a
moment
,
as
if
he
had
not
heard
Newman
's
*NL*
refusal
.
``
My
mother
and
I
,
last
evening
,
''
he
said
,
``
talked
over
your
*NL*
story
.
You
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
we
think
your
little
document
*NL*
is
--
a
''
--
and
he
held
back
his
word
a
moment
--
``
is
genuine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
that
with
you
I
am
used
to
surprises
!
''
exclaimed
Newman
,
*NL*
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
smallest
amount
of
respect
that
we
owe
to
my
father
's
memory
,
''
*NL*
the
marquis
continued
,
``
makes
us
desire
that
he
should
not
be
held
up
to
*NL*
the
world
as
the
author
of
so
--
so
infernal
an
attack
upon
the
reputation
*NL*
of
a
wife
whose
only
fault
was
that
she
had
been
submissive
to
*NL*
accumulated
injury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
It
's
for
your
father
's
sake
.
''
And
he
laughed
*NL*
the
laugh
in
which
he
indulged
when
he
was
most
amused
--
a
noiseless
*NL*
laugh
,
with
his
lips
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
gravity
held
good
.
``
There
are
a
few
of
my
*NL*
father
's
particular
friends
for
whom
the
knowledge
of
so
--
so
unfortunate
*NL*
an
--
inspiration
--
would
be
a
real
grief
.
Even
say
we
firmly
established
*NL*
by
medical
evidence
the
presumption
of
a
mind
disordered
by
fever
,
il
*NL*
en
resterait
quelque
chose
.
At
the
best
it
would
look
ill
in
him
.
Very
*NL*
ill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
try
medical
evidence
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
Do
n't
touch
the
doctors
and
*NL*
they
wo
n't
touch
you
.
I
do
n't
mind
your
knowing
that
I
have
not
written
*NL*
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
fancied
that
he
saw
signs
in
M.
de
Bellegarde
's
discolored
mask
*NL*
that
this
information
was
extremely
pertinent
.
But
it
may
have
been
*NL*
merely
fancy
;
for
the
marquis
remained
majestically
argumentative
.
``
For
*NL*
instance
,
Madame
d'Outreville
,
''
he
said
,
``
of
whom
you
spoke
yesterday
.
I
*NL*
can
imagine
nothing
that
would
shock
her
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
am
quite
prepared
to
shock
Madame
d'Outreville
,
you
know
.
That
's
*NL*
on
the
cards
.
I
expect
to
shock
a
great
many
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
examined
for
a
moment
the
stitching
on
the
back
of
one
*NL*
of
his
gloves
.
Then
,
without
looking
up
,
``
We
do
n't
offer
you
money
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
That
we
supposed
to
be
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
turning
away
,
took
a
few
turns
about
the
room
and
then
came
*NL*
back
.
``
What
DO
you
offer
me
?
By
what
I
can
make
out
,
the
generosity
is
*NL*
all
to
be
on
my
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
dropped
his
arms
at
his
side
and
held
his
head
a
little
*NL*
higher
.
``
What
we
offer
you
is
a
chance
--
a
chance
that
a
gentleman
should
*NL*
appreciate
.
A
chance
to
abstain
from
inflicting
a
terrible
blot
upon
the
*NL*
memory
of
a
man
who
certainly
had
his
faults
,
but
who
,
personally
,
had
*NL*
done
you
no
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
things
to
say
to
that
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
The
first
is
,
*NL*
as
regards
appreciating
your
`
chance
,
'
that
you
do
n't
consider
me
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
That
's
your
great
point
you
know
.
It
's
a
poor
rule
that
wo
n't
*NL*
work
both
ways
.
The
second
is
that
--
well
,
in
a
word
,
you
are
talking
*NL*
great
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
who
in
the
midst
of
his
bitterness
had
,
as
I
have
said
,
kept
*NL*
well
before
his
eyes
a
certain
ideal
of
saying
nothing
rude
,
was
*NL*
immediately
somewhat
regretfully
conscious
of
the
sharpness
of
these
*NL*
words
.
But
he
speedily
observed
that
the
marquis
took
them
more
quietly
*NL*
than
might
have
been
expected
.
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
like
the
stately
*NL*
ambassador
that
he
was
,
continued
the
policy
of
ignoring
what
was
*NL*
disagreeable
in
his
adversary
's
replies
.
He
gazed
at
the
gilded
*NL*
arabesques
on
the
opposite
wall
,
and
then
presently
transferred
his
*NL*
glance
to
Newman
,
as
if
he
too
were
a
large
grotesque
in
a
rather
*NL*
vulgar
system
of
chamber-decoration
.
``
I
suppose
you
know
that
as
regards
*NL*
yourself
it
wo
n't
do
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
it
wo
n't
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
you
damn
yourself
.
But
I
suppose
that
's
in
your
*NL*
programme
.
You
propose
to
throw
mud
at
us
;
you
believe
,
you
hope
,
that
*NL*
some
of
it
may
stick
.
We
know
,
of
course
,
it
ca
n't
,
''
explained
the
*NL*
marquis
in
a
tone
of
conscious
lucidity
;
``
but
you
take
the
chance
,
and
*NL*
are
willing
at
any
rate
to
show
that
you
yourself
have
dirty
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
comparison
;
at
least
half
of
it
is
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
I
*NL*
take
the
chance
of
something
sticking
.
But
as
regards
my
hands
,
they
are
*NL*
clean
.
I
have
taken
the
matter
up
with
my
finger-tips
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
looked
a
moment
into
his
hat
.
``
All
our
friends
are
*NL*
quite
with
us
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
would
have
done
exactly
as
we
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
believe
that
when
I
hear
them
say
it
.
Meanwhile
I
shall
think
*NL*
better
of
human
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
looked
into
his
hat
again
.
``
Madame
de
Cintre
was
extremely
*NL*
fond
of
her
father
.
If
she
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
few
written
*NL*
words
of
which
you
propose
to
make
this
scandalous
use
,
she
would
demand
*NL*
of
you
proudly
for
his
sake
to
give
it
up
to
her
,
and
she
would
destroy
*NL*
it
without
reading
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
,
''
Newman
rejoined
.
``
But
she
will
not
know
.
I
was
in
that
*NL*
convent
yesterday
and
I
know
what
SHE
is
doing
.
Lord
deliver
us
!
You
can
*NL*
guess
whether
it
made
me
feel
forgiving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
appeared
to
have
nothing
more
to
suggest
;
but
he
*NL*
continued
to
stand
there
,
rigid
and
elegant
,
as
a
man
who
believed
that
*NL*
his
mere
personal
presence
had
an
argumentative
value
.
Newman
*NL*
watched
him
,
and
,
without
yielding
an
inch
on
the
main
issue
,
felt
an
*NL*
incongruously
good-natured
impulse
to
help
him
to
retreat
in
good
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
visit
's
a
failure
,
you
see
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
offer
too
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Propose
something
yourself
,
''
said
the
marquis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
back
Madame
de
Cintre
in
the
same
state
in
which
you
took
her
*NL*
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
threw
back
his
head
and
his
pale
face
flushed
.
``
Never
!
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
would
n't
if
we
could
!
In
the
sentiment
which
led
us
to
deprecate
her
*NL*
marriage
nothing
is
changed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Deprecate
'
is
good
!
''
cried
Newman
.
``
It
was
hardly
worth
while
to
come
*NL*
here
only
to
tell
me
that
you
are
not
ashamed
of
yourselves
.
I
could
*NL*
have
guessed
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
marquis
slowly
walked
toward
the
door
,
and
Newman
,
following
,
opened
*NL*
it
for
him
.
``
What
you
propose
to
do
will
be
very
disagreeable
,
''
M.
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
said
.
``
That
is
very
evident
.
But
it
will
be
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
understand
it
,
''
Newman
answered
,
``
that
will
be
quite
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
stood
for
a
moment
looking
on
the
ground
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
ransacking
his
ingenuity
to
see
what
else
he
could
do
to
save
his
*NL*
father
's
reputation
.
Then
,
with
a
little
cold
sigh
,
he
seemed
to
signify
*NL*
that
he
regretfully
surrendered
the
late
marquis
to
the
penalty
of
his
*NL*
turpitude
.
He
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
shrug
,
took
his
neat
umbrella
*NL*
from
the
servant
in
the
vestibule
,
and
,
with
his
gentlemanly
walk
,
*NL*
passed
out
.
Newman
stood
listening
till
he
heard
the
door
close
;
then
he
*NL*
slowly
exclaimed
,
``
Well
,
I
ought
to
begin
to
be
satisfied
now
!

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
called
upon
the
comical
duchess
and
found
her
at
home
.
An
old
*NL*
gentleman
with
a
high
nose
and
a
gold-headed
cane
was
just
taking
leave
*NL*
of
her
;
he
made
Newman
a
protracted
obeisance
as
he
retired
,
and
our
*NL*
hero
supposed
that
he
was
one
of
the
mysterious
grandees
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
shaken
hands
at
Madame
de
Bellegarde
's
ball
.
The
duchess
,
in
her
*NL*
arm-chair
,
from
which
she
did
not
move
,
with
a
great
flower-pot
on
one
*NL*
side
of
her
,
a
pile
of
pink-covered
novels
on
the
other
,
and
a
large
*NL*
piece
of
tapestry
depending
from
her
lap
,
presented
an
expansive
and
*NL*
imposing
front
;
but
her
aspect
was
in
the
highest
degree
gracious
,
and
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
to
check
the
effusion
of
his
confidence
.
*NL*
She
talked
to
him
about
flowers
and
books
,
getting
launched
with
*NL*
marvelous
promptitude
;
about
the
theatres
,
about
the
peculiar
*NL*
institutions
of
his
native
country
,
about
the
humidity
of
Paris
about
*NL*
the
pretty
complexions
of
the
American
ladies
,
about
his
impressions
*NL*
of
France
and
his
opinion
of
its
female
inhabitants
.
All
this
was
a
*NL*
brilliant
monologue
on
the
part
of
the
duchess
,
who
,
like
many
of
*NL*
her
country-women
,
was
a
person
of
an
affirmative
rather
than
an
*NL*
interrogative
cast
of
mind
,
who
made
mots
and
put
them
herself
into
*NL*
circulation
,
and
who
was
apt
to
offer
you
a
present
of
a
convenient
*NL*
little
opinion
,
neatly
enveloped
in
the
gilt
paper
of
a
happy
Gallicism
.
*NL*
Newman
had
come
to
her
with
a
grievance
,
but
he
found
himself
in
an
*NL*
atmosphere
in
which
apparently
no
cognizance
was
taken
of
grievance
;
an
*NL*
atmosphere
into
which
the
chill
of
discomfort
had
never
penetrated
,
*NL*
and
which
seemed
exclusively
made
up
of
mild
,
sweet
,
stale
intellectual
*NL*
perfumes
.
The
feeling
with
which
he
had
watched
Madame
d'Outreville
at
*NL*
the
treacherous
festival
of
the
Bellegardes
came
back
to
him
;
she
struck
*NL*
him
as
a
wonderful
old
lady
in
a
comedy
,
particularly
well
up
in
her
*NL*
part
.
He
observed
before
long
that
she
asked
him
no
questions
about
*NL*
their
common
friends
;
she
made
no
allusion
to
the
circumstances
under
*NL*
which
he
had
been
presented
to
her
.
She
neither
feigned
ignorance
of
a
*NL*
change
in
these
circumstances
nor
pretended
to
condole
with
him
upon
it
;
*NL*
but
she
smiled
and
discoursed
and
compared
the
tender-tinted
wools
of
*NL*
her
tapestry
,
as
if
the
Bellegardes
and
their
wickedness
were
not
of
*NL*
this
world
.
``
She
is
fighting
shy
!
''
said
Newman
to
himself
;
and
,
having
*NL*
made
the
observation
,
he
was
prompted
to
observe
,
farther
,
how
the
*NL*
duchess
would
carry
off
her
indifference
.
She
did
so
in
a
masterly
*NL*
manner
.
There
was
not
a
gleam
of
disguised
consciousness
in
those
*NL*
small
,
clear
,
demonstrative
eyes
which
constituted
her
nearest
claim
to
*NL*
personal
loveliness
,
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
apprehension
that
Newman
*NL*
would
trench
upon
the
ground
she
proposed
to
avoid
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
*NL*
she
does
it
very
well
,
''
he
tacitly
commented
.
``
They
all
hold
together
*NL*
bravely
,
and
,
whether
any
one
else
can
trust
them
or
not
,
they
can
*NL*
certainly
trust
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
,
at
this
juncture
,
fell
to
admiring
the
duchess
for
her
fine
*NL*
manners
.
He
felt
,
most
accurately
,
that
she
was
not
a
grain
less
urbane
*NL*
than
she
would
have
been
if
his
marriage
were
still
in
prospect
;
but
*NL*
he
felt
also
that
she
was
not
a
particle
more
urbane
.
He
had
come
,
*NL*
so
reasoned
the
duchess
--
Heaven
knew
why
he
had
come
,
after
what
had
*NL*
happened
;
and
for
the
half
hour
,
therefore
,
she
would
be
charmante
.
But
*NL*
she
would
never
see
him
again
.
Finding
no
ready-made
opportunity
to
tell
*NL*
his
story
,
Newman
pondered
these
things
more
dispassionately
than
might
*NL*
have
been
expected
;
he
stretched
his
legs
,
as
usual
,
and
even
chuckled
a
*NL*
little
,
appreciatively
and
noiselessly
.
And
then
as
the
duchess
went
on
*NL*
relating
a
mot
with
which
her
mother
had
snubbed
the
great
Napoleon
,
it
*NL*
occurred
to
Newman
that
her
evasion
of
a
chapter
of
French
history
*NL*
more
interesting
to
himself
might
possibly
be
the
result
of
an
extreme
*NL*
consideration
for
his
feelings
.
Perhaps
it
was
delicacy
on
the
duchess
's
*NL*
part
--
not
policy
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
himself
,
to
*NL*
make
the
chance
which
he
had
determined
to
give
her
still
better
,
when
*NL*
the
servant
announced
another
visitor
.
The
duchess
,
on
hearing
the
*NL*
name
--
it
was
that
of
an
Italian
prince
--
gave
a
little
imperceptible
*NL*
pout
,
and
said
to
Newman
,
rapidly
:
``
I
beg
you
to
remain
;
I
desire
*NL*
this
visit
to
be
short
.
''
Newman
said
to
himself
,
at
this
,
that
*NL*
Madame
d'Outreville
intended
,
after
all
,
that
they
should
discuss
the
*NL*
Bellegardes
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
was
a
short
,
stout
man
,
with
a
head
disproportionately
large
.
*NL*
He
had
a
dusky
complexion
and
a
bushy
eyebrow
,
beneath
which
his
*NL*
eye
wore
a
fixed
and
somewhat
defiant
expression
;
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
challenging
you
to
insinuate
that
he
was
top-heavy
.
The
duchess
,
judging
*NL*
from
her
charge
to
Newman
,
regarded
him
as
a
bore
;
but
this
was
not
*NL*
apparent
from
the
unchecked
flow
of
her
conversation
.
She
made
a
fresh
*NL*
series
of
mots
,
characterized
with
great
felicity
the
Italian
intellect
*NL*
and
the
taste
of
the
figs
at
Sorrento
,
predicted
the
ultimate
future
of
*NL*
the
Italian
kingdom
-LRB-
disgust
with
the
brutal
Sardinian
rule
and
complete
*NL*
reversion
,
throughout
the
peninsula
,
to
the
sacred
sway
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Father
-RRB-
,
and
,
finally
,
gave
a
history
of
the
love
affairs
of
the
*NL*
Princess
X
--
.
This
narrative
provoked
some
rectifications
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
prince
,
who
,
as
he
said
,
pretended
to
know
something
about
that
*NL*
matter
;
and
having
satisfied
himself
that
Newman
was
in
no
laughing
*NL*
mood
,
either
with
regard
to
the
size
of
his
head
or
anything
else
,
he
*NL*
entered
into
the
controversy
with
an
animation
for
which
the
duchess
,
*NL*
when
she
set
him
down
as
a
bore
,
could
not
have
been
prepared
.
The
*NL*
sentimental
vicissitudes
of
the
Princess
X
--
led
to
a
discussion
of
the
*NL*
heart
history
of
Florentine
nobility
in
general
;
the
duchess
had
spent
*NL*
five
weeks
in
Florence
and
had
gathered
much
information
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
This
was
merged
,
in
turn
,
in
an
examination
of
the
Italian
heart
per
se
.
*NL*
The
duchess
took
a
brilliantly
heterodox
view
--
thought
it
the
least
*NL*
susceptible
organ
of
its
kind
that
she
had
ever
encountered
,
related
*NL*
examples
of
its
want
of
susceptibility
,
and
at
last
declared
that
for
*NL*
her
the
Italians
were
a
people
of
ice
.
The
prince
became
flame
to
refute
*NL*
her
,
and
his
visit
really
proved
charming
.
Newman
was
naturally
out
of
*NL*
the
conversation
;
he
sat
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
,
watching
*NL*
the
interlocutors
.
The
duchess
,
as
she
talked
,
frequently
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
as
if
to
intimate
,
in
the
charming
manner
of
her
nation
,
*NL*
that
it
lay
only
with
him
to
say
something
very
much
to
the
point
.
But
*NL*
he
said
nothing
at
all
,
and
at
last
his
thoughts
began
to
wander
.
A
*NL*
singular
feeling
came
over
him
--
a
sudden
sense
of
the
folly
of
his
*NL*
errand
.
What
under
the
sun
had
he
to
say
to
the
duchess
,
after
all
?
*NL*
Wherein
would
it
profit
him
to
tell
her
that
the
Bellegardes
were
*NL*
traitors
and
that
the
old
lady
,
into
the
bargain
was
a
murderess
?
He
*NL*
seemed
morally
to
have
turned
a
sort
of
somersault
,
and
to
find
things
*NL*
looking
differently
in
consequence
.
He
felt
a
sudden
stiffening
of
*NL*
his
will
and
quickening
of
his
reserve
.
What
in
the
world
had
he
been
*NL*
thinking
of
when
he
fancied
the
duchess
could
help
him
,
and
that
it
*NL*
would
conduce
to
his
comfort
to
make
her
think
ill
of
the
Bellegardes
?
*NL*
What
did
her
opinion
of
the
Bellegardes
matter
to
him
?
It
was
only
a
*NL*
shade
more
important
than
the
opinion
the
Bellegardes
entertained
of
*NL*
her
.
The
duchess
help
him
--
that
cold
,
stout
,
soft
,
artificial
woman
help
*NL*
him
?
--
she
who
in
the
last
twenty
minutes
had
built
up
between
them
a
*NL*
wall
of
polite
conversation
in
which
she
evidently
flattered
herself
*NL*
that
he
would
never
find
a
gate
.
Had
it
come
to
that
--
that
he
was
asking
*NL*
favors
of
conceited
people
,
and
appealing
for
sympathy
where
he
had
*NL*
no
sympathy
to
give
?
He
rested
his
arms
on
his
knees
,
and
sat
for
some
*NL*
minutes
staring
into
his
hat
.
As
he
did
so
his
ears
tingled
--
he
had
come
*NL*
very
near
being
an
ass
.
Whether
or
no
the
duchess
would
hear
his
story
,
*NL*
he
would
n't
tell
it
.
Was
he
to
sit
there
another
half
hour
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
exposing
the
Bellegardes
?
The
Bellegardes
be
hanged
!
He
got
up
*NL*
abruptly
,
and
advanced
to
shake
hands
with
his
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
stay
longer
?
''
she
asked
,
very
graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
not
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
,
``
I
had
an
idea
you
had
something
*NL*
particular
to
say
to
me
,
''
she
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
looked
at
her
;
he
felt
a
little
dizzy
;
for
the
moment
he
seemed
*NL*
to
be
turning
his
somersault
again
.
The
little
Italian
prince
came
to
*NL*
his
help
:
``
Ah
,
madam
,
who
has
not
that
?
''
he
softly
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
teach
Mr.
Newman
to
say
fadaises
,
''
said
the
duchess
.
``
It
is
his
*NL*
merit
that
he
does
n't
know
how
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
n't
know
how
to
say
fadaises
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
and
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
say
anything
unpleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
you
are
very
considerate
,
''
said
the
duchess
with
a
smile
;
and
*NL*
she
gave
him
a
little
nod
for
good-by
with
which
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
street
,
he
stood
for
some
time
on
the
pavement
,
wondering
*NL*
whether
,
after
all
,
he
was
not
an
ass
not
to
have
discharged
his
pistol
.
*NL*
And
then
again
he
decided
that
to
talk
to
any
one
whomsoever
about
*NL*
the
Bellegardes
would
be
extremely
disagreeable
to
him
.
The
least
*NL*
disagreeable
thing
,
under
the
circumstances
,
was
to
banish
them
from
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
never
think
of
them
again
.
Indecision
had
not
hitherto
*NL*
been
one
of
Newman
's
weaknesses
,
and
in
this
case
it
was
not
of
long
*NL*
duration
.
For
three
days
after
this
he
did
not
,
or
at
least
he
tried
not
*NL*
to
,
think
of
the
Bellegardes
.
He
dined
with
Mrs.
Tristram
,
and
on
her
*NL*
mentioning
their
name
,
he
begged
her
almost
severely
to
desist
.
This
*NL*
gave
Tom
Tristram
a
much-coveted
opportunity
to
offer
his
condolences
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
forward
,
laying
his
hand
on
Newman
's
arm
compressing
his
lips
*NL*
and
shaking
his
head
.
``
The
fact
is
my
dear
fellow
,
you
see
,
that
you
*NL*
ought
never
to
have
gone
into
it
.
It
was
not
your
doing
,
I
know
--
it
was
*NL*
all
my
wife
.
If
you
want
to
come
down
on
her
,
I
'll
stand
off
;
I
give
you
*NL*
leave
to
hit
her
as
hard
as
you
like
.
You
know
she
has
never
had
a
word
*NL*
of
reproach
from
me
in
her
life
,
and
I
think
she
is
in
need
of
something
*NL*
of
the
kind
.
Why
did
n't
you
listen
to
ME
?
You
know
I
did
n't
believe
in
*NL*
the
thing
.
I
thought
it
at
the
best
an
amiable
delusion
.
I
do
n't
profess
*NL*
to
be
a
Don
Juan
or
a
gay
Lothario
,
--
that
class
of
man
,
you
know
;
but
I
*NL*
do
pretend
to
know
something
about
the
harder
sex
.
I
have
never
disliked
*NL*
a
woman
in
my
life
that
she
has
not
turned
out
badly
.
I
was
not
at
all
*NL*
deceived
in
Lizzie
,
for
instance
;
I
always
had
my
doubts
about
her
.
*NL*
Whatever
you
may
think
of
my
present
situation
,
I
must
at
least
admit
*NL*
that
I
got
into
it
with
my
eyes
open
.
Now
suppose
you
had
got
into
*NL*
something
like
this
box
with
Madame
de
Cintre
.
You
may
depend
upon
it
*NL*
she
would
have
turned
out
a
stiff
one
.
And
upon
my
word
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
where
you
could
have
found
your
comfort
.
Not
from
the
marquis
,
my
dear
*NL*
Newman
;
he
was
n't
a
man
you
could
go
and
talk
things
over
with
in
a
*NL*
sociable
,
common-sense
way
.
Did
he
ever
seem
to
want
to
have
you
on
the
*NL*
premises
--
did
he
ever
try
to
see
you
alone
?
Did
he
ever
ask
you
to
come
*NL*
and
smoke
a
cigar
with
him
of
an
evening
,
or
step
in
,
when
you
had
been
*NL*
calling
on
the
ladies
,
and
take
something
?
I
do
n't
think
you
would
have
*NL*
got
much
encouragement
out
of
HIM
.
And
as
for
the
old
lady
,
she
struck
*NL*
one
as
an
uncommonly
strong
dose
.
They
have
a
great
expression
here
,
you
*NL*
know
;
they
call
it
`
sympathetic
.
'
Everything
is
sympathetic
--
or
ought
*NL*
to
be
.
Now
Madame
de
Bellegarde
is
about
as
sympathetic
as
that
*NL*
mustard-pot
.
They
're
a
d
--
d
cold-blooded
lot
,
any
way
;
I
felt
it
awfully
*NL*
at
that
ball
of
theirs
.
I
felt
as
if
I
were
walking
up
and
down
in
the
*NL*
Armory
,
in
the
Tower
of
London
!
My
dear
boy
,
do
n't
think
me
a
vulgar
*NL*
brute
for
hinting
at
it
,
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
all
they
wanted
*NL*
was
your
money
.
I
know
something
about
that
;
I
can
tell
when
people
*NL*
want
one
's
money
!
Why
they
stopped
wanting
yours
I
do
n't
know
;
I
suppose
*NL*
because
they
could
get
some
one
else
's
without
working
so
hard
for
it
.
*NL*
It
is
n't
worth
finding
out
.
It
may
be
that
it
was
not
Madame
de
Cintre
*NL*
that
backed
out
first
,
very
likely
the
old
woman
put
her
up
to
it
.
I
*NL*
suspect
she
and
her
mother
are
really
as
thick
as
thieves
,
eh
?
You
are
*NL*
well
out
of
it
,
my
boy
;
make
up
your
mind
to
that
.
If
I
express
myself
*NL*
strongly
it
is
all
because
I
love
you
so
much
;
and
from
that
point
of
*NL*
view
I
may
say
I
should
as
soon
have
thought
of
making
up
to
that
piece
*NL*
of
pale
high-mightiness
as
I
should
have
thought
of
making
up
to
the
*NL*
Obelisk
in
the
Place
des
la
Concorde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
sat
gazing
at
Tristram
during
this
harangue
with
a
lack-lustre
*NL*
eye
;
never
yet
had
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
outgrown
so
completely
*NL*
the
phase
of
equal
comradeship
with
Tom
Tristram
.
Mrs.
Tristram
's
glance
*NL*
at
her
husband
had
more
of
a
spark
;
she
turned
to
Newman
with
a
slightly
*NL*
lurid
smile
.
``
You
must
at
least
do
justice
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
the
felicity
*NL*
with
which
Mr.
Tristram
repairs
the
indiscretions
of
a
too
zealous
*NL*
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
without
the
aid
of
Tom
Tristram
's
conversational
felicities
,
*NL*
Newman
would
have
begun
to
think
of
the
Bellegardes
again
.
He
could
*NL*
cease
to
think
of
them
only
when
he
ceased
to
think
of
his
loss
and
*NL*
privation
,
and
the
days
had
as
yet
but
scantily
lightened
the
weight
*NL*
of
this
incommodity
.
In
vain
Mrs.
Tristram
begged
him
to
cheer
up
;
she
*NL*
assured
him
that
the
sight
of
his
countenance
made
her
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
help
it
?
''
he
demanded
with
a
trembling
voice
.
``
I
feel
like
*NL*
a
widower
--
and
a
widower
who
has
not
even
the
consolation
of
going
to
*NL*
stand
beside
the
grave
of
his
wife
--
who
has
not
the
right
to
wear
so
*NL*
much
mourning
as
a
weed
on
his
hat
.
I
feel
,
''
he
added
in
a
moment
``
as
if
*NL*
my
wife
had
been
murdered
and
her
assassins
were
still
at
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
made
no
immediate
rejoinder
,
but
at
last
she
said
,
with
*NL*
a
smile
which
,
in
so
far
as
it
was
a
forced
one
,
was
less
successfully
*NL*
simulated
than
such
smiles
,
on
her
lips
,
usually
were
;
``
Are
you
very
*NL*
sure
that
you
would
have
been
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stared
a
moment
,
and
then
shook
his
head
.
``
That
's
weak
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
that
wo
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
with
a
more
triumphant
bravery
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
you
would
have
been
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
little
laugh
.
``
Say
I
should
have
been
miserable
,
then
;
*NL*
it
's
a
misery
I
should
have
preferred
to
any
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
began
to
muse
.
``
I
should
have
been
curious
to
see
;
it
*NL*
would
have
been
very
strange
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
from
curiosity
that
you
urged
me
to
try
and
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
growing
still
more
audacious
.
Newman
*NL*
gave
her
the
one
angry
look
he
had
been
destined
ever
to
give
her
,
*NL*
turned
away
and
took
up
his
hat
.
She
watched
him
a
moment
,
and
then
*NL*
she
said
,
``
That
sounds
very
cruel
,
but
it
is
less
so
than
it
sounds
.
*NL*
Curiosity
has
a
share
in
almost
everything
I
do
.
I
wanted
very
much
to
*NL*
see
,
first
,
whether
such
a
marriage
could
actually
take
place
;
second
,
*NL*
what
would
happen
if
it
should
take
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
n't
believe
,
''
said
Newman
,
resentfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
believed
--
I
believed
that
it
would
take
place
,
and
that
you
*NL*
would
be
happy
.
Otherwise
I
should
have
been
,
among
my
speculations
,
*NL*
a
very
heartless
creature
.
BUT
,
''
she
continued
,
laying
her
hand
upon
*NL*
Newman
's
arm
and
hazarding
a
grave
smile
,
``
it
was
the
highest
flight
*NL*
ever
taken
by
a
tolerably
bold
imagination
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
this
she
recommended
him
to
leave
Paris
and
travel
for
*NL*
three
months
.
Change
of
scene
would
do
him
good
,
and
he
would
forget
his
*NL*
misfortune
sooner
in
absence
from
the
objects
which
had
witnessed
it
.
``
I
*NL*
really
feel
,
''
Newman
rejoined
,
``
as
if
to
leave
YOU
,
at
least
,
would
do
*NL*
me
good
--
and
cost
me
very
little
effort
.
You
are
growing
cynical
,
you
*NL*
shock
me
and
pain
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
good-naturedly
or
cynically
,
as
may
be
*NL*
thought
most
probable
.
``
I
shall
certainly
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
very
willing
to
get
away
from
Paris
;
the
brilliant
streets
he
*NL*
had
walked
through
in
his
happier
hours
,
and
which
then
seemed
to
wear
*NL*
a
higher
brilliancy
in
honor
of
his
happiness
,
appeared
now
to
be
in
*NL*
the
secret
of
his
defeat
and
to
look
down
upon
it
in
shining
mockery
.
He
*NL*
would
go
somewhere
;
he
cared
little
where
;
and
he
made
his
preparations
.
*NL*
Then
,
one
morning
,
at
haphazard
,
he
drove
to
the
train
that
would
*NL*
transport
him
to
Boulogne
and
dispatch
him
thence
to
the
shores
of
*NL*
Britain
.
As
he
rolled
along
in
the
train
he
asked
himself
what
had
*NL*
become
of
his
revenge
,
and
he
was
able
to
say
that
it
was
provisionally
*NL*
pigeon-holed
in
a
very
safe
place
;
it
would
keep
till
called
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arrived
in
London
in
the
midst
of
what
is
called
``
the
season
,
''
and
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
at
first
that
he
might
here
put
himself
in
the
way
*NL*
of
being
diverted
from
his
heavy-heartedness
.
He
knew
no
one
in
all
*NL*
England
,
but
the
spectacle
of
the
mighty
metropolis
roused
him
somewhat
*NL*
from
his
apathy
.
Anything
that
was
enormous
usually
found
favor
with
*NL*
Newman
,
and
the
multitudinous
energies
and
industries
of
England
stirred
*NL*
within
him
a
dull
vivacity
of
contemplation
.
It
is
on
record
that
the
*NL*
weather
,
at
that
moment
,
was
of
the
finest
English
quality
;
he
took
*NL*
long
walks
and
explored
London
in
every
direction
;
he
sat
by
the
hour
in
*NL*
Kensington
Gardens
and
beside
the
adjoining
Drive
,
watching
the
people
*NL*
and
the
horses
and
the
carriages
;
the
rosy
English
beauties
,
the
*NL*
wonderful
English
dandies
,
and
the
splendid
flunkies
.
He
went
to
the
*NL*
opera
and
found
it
better
than
in
Paris
;
he
went
to
the
theatre
and
*NL*
found
a
surprising
charm
in
listening
to
dialogue
the
finest
points
*NL*
of
which
came
within
the
range
of
his
comprehension
.
He
made
several
*NL*
excursions
into
the
country
,
recommended
by
the
waiter
at
his
hotel
,
*NL*
with
whom
,
on
this
and
similar
points
,
he
had
established
confidential
*NL*
relations
.
He
watched
the
deer
in
Windsor
Forest
and
admired
the
Thames
*NL*
from
Richmond
Hill
;
he
ate
white-bait
and
brown-bread
and
butter
*NL*
at
Greenwich
,
and
strolled
in
the
grassy
shadow
of
the
cathedral
of
*NL*
Canterbury
.
He
also
visited
the
Tower
of
London
and
Madame
Tussaud
's
*NL*
exhibition
.
One
day
he
thought
he
would
go
to
Sheffield
,
and
then
,
*NL*
thinking
again
,
he
gave
it
up
.
Why
should
he
go
to
Sheffield
?
He
had
*NL*
a
feeling
that
the
link
which
bound
him
to
a
possible
interest
in
the
*NL*
manufacture
of
cutlery
was
broken
.
He
had
no
desire
for
an
``
inside
view
''
*NL*
of
any
successful
enterprise
whatever
,
and
he
would
not
have
given
the
*NL*
smallest
sum
for
the
privilege
of
talking
over
the
details
of
the
most
*NL*
``
splendid
''
business
with
the
shrewdest
of
overseers
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
he
had
walked
into
Hyde
Park
,
and
was
slowly
threading
*NL*
his
way
through
the
human
maze
which
edges
the
Drive
.
The
stream
of
*NL*
carriages
was
no
less
dense
,
and
Newman
,
as
usual
,
marveled
at
the
*NL*
strange
,
dingy
figures
which
he
saw
taking
the
air
in
some
of
the
*NL*
stateliest
vehicles
.
They
reminded
him
of
what
he
had
read
of
eastern
*NL*
and
southern
countries
,
in
which
grotesque
idols
and
fetiches
were
*NL*
sometimes
taken
out
of
their
temples
and
carried
abroad
in
golden
*NL*
chariots
to
be
displayed
to
the
multitude
.
He
saw
a
great
many
pretty
*NL*
cheeks
beneath
high-plumed
hats
as
he
squeezed
his
way
through
serried
*NL*
waves
of
crumpled
muslin
;
and
sitting
on
little
chairs
at
the
base
of
*NL*
the
great
serious
English
trees
,
he
observed
a
number
of
quiet-eyed
*NL*
maidens
who
seemed
only
to
remind
him
afresh
that
the
magic
of
beauty
*NL*
had
gone
out
of
the
world
with
Madame
de
Cintre
:
to
say
nothing
of
other
*NL*
damsels
,
whose
eyes
were
not
quiet
,
and
who
struck
him
still
more
as
a
*NL*
satire
on
possible
consolation
.
He
had
been
walking
for
some
time
,
when
,
*NL*
directly
in
front
of
him
,
borne
back
by
the
summer
breeze
,
he
heard
a
*NL*
few
words
uttered
in
that
bright
Parisian
idiom
from
which
his
ears
had
*NL*
begun
to
alienate
themselves
.
The
voice
in
which
the
words
were
spoken
*NL*
made
them
seem
even
more
like
a
thing
with
which
he
had
once
been
*NL*
familiar
,
and
as
he
bent
his
eyes
it
lent
an
identity
to
the
commonplace
*NL*
elegance
of
the
back
hair
and
shoulders
of
a
young
lady
walking
in
the
*NL*
same
direction
as
himself
.
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
apparently
,
had
come
to
*NL*
seek
a
more
rapid
advancement
in
London
,
and
another
glance
led
Newman
*NL*
to
suppose
that
she
had
found
it
.
A
gentleman
was
strolling
beside
her
,
*NL*
lending
a
most
attentive
ear
to
her
conversation
and
too
entranced
to
*NL*
open
his
lips
.
Newman
did
not
hear
his
voice
,
but
perceived
that
*NL*
he
presented
the
dorsal
expression
of
a
well-dressed
Englishman
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Nioche
was
attracting
attention
:
the
ladies
who
passed
her
*NL*
turned
round
to
survey
the
Parisian
perfection
of
her
toilet
.
A
great
*NL*
cataract
of
flounces
rolled
down
from
the
young
lady
's
waist
to
Newman
's
*NL*
feet
;
he
had
to
step
aside
to
avoid
treading
upon
them
.
He
stepped
*NL*
aside
,
indeed
,
with
a
decision
of
movement
which
the
occasion
scarcely
*NL*
demanded
;
for
even
this
imperfect
glimpse
of
Miss
Noemie
had
excited
*NL*
his
displeasure
.
She
seemed
an
odious
blot
upon
the
face
of
nature
;
*NL*
he
wanted
to
put
her
out
of
his
sight
.
He
thought
of
Valentin
de
*NL*
Bellegarde
,
still
green
in
the
earth
of
his
burial
--
his
young
life
*NL*
clipped
by
this
flourishing
impudence
.
The
perfume
of
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
finery
sickened
him
;
he
turned
his
head
and
tried
to
deflect
his
course
;
*NL*
but
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
kept
him
near
her
a
few
minutes
longer
,
so
*NL*
that
he
heard
what
she
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
am
sure
he
will
miss
me
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
It
was
very
cruel
in
me
*NL*
to
leave
him
;
I
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
a
very
heartless
creature
.
*NL*
He
might
perfectly
well
have
come
with
us
.
I
do
n't
think
he
is
very
*NL*
well
,
''
she
added
;
``
it
seemed
to
me
to-day
that
he
was
not
very
gay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
wondered
whom
she
was
talking
about
,
but
just
then
an
opening
*NL*
among
his
neighbors
enabled
him
to
turn
away
,
and
he
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
she
was
probably
paying
a
tribute
to
British
propriety
and
playing
*NL*
at
tender
solicitude
about
her
papa
.
Was
that
miserable
old
man
still
*NL*
treading
the
path
of
vice
in
her
train
?
Was
he
still
giving
her
the
*NL*
benefit
of
his
experience
of
affairs
,
and
had
he
crossed
the
sea
to
*NL*
serve
as
her
interpreter
?
Newman
walked
some
distance
farther
,
and
then
*NL*
began
to
retrace
his
steps
taking
care
not
to
traverse
again
the
orbit
*NL*
of
Mademoiselle
Nioche
.
At
last
he
looked
for
a
chair
under
the
trees
,
*NL*
but
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
an
empty
one
.
He
was
about
to
give
*NL*
up
the
search
when
he
saw
a
gentleman
rise
from
the
seat
he
had
been
*NL*
occupying
,
leaving
Newman
to
take
it
without
looking
at
his
neighbors
.
*NL*
He
sat
there
for
some
time
without
heeding
them
;
his
attention
was
lost
*NL*
in
the
irritation
and
bitterness
produced
by
his
recent
glimpse
of
Miss
*NL*
Noemie
's
iniquitous
vitality
.
But
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
*NL*
dropping
his
eyes
,
he
perceived
a
small
pug-dog
squatted
upon
the
path
*NL*
near
his
feet
--
a
diminutive
but
very
perfect
specimen
of
its
interesting
*NL*
species
.
The
pug
was
sniffing
at
the
fashionable
world
,
as
it
passed
*NL*
him
,
with
his
little
black
muzzle
,
and
was
kept
from
extending
his
*NL*
investigation
by
a
large
blue
ribbon
attached
to
his
collar
with
an
*NL*
enormous
rosette
and
held
in
the
hand
of
a
person
seated
next
to
*NL*
Newman
.
To
this
person
Newman
transferred
his
attention
,
and
immediately
*NL*
perceived
that
he
was
the
object
of
all
that
of
his
neighbor
,
who
was
*NL*
staring
up
at
him
from
a
pair
of
little
fixed
white
eyes
.
These
eyes
*NL*
Newman
instantly
recognized
;
he
had
been
sitting
for
the
last
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
beside
M.
Nioche
.
He
had
vaguely
felt
that
some
one
was
staring
*NL*
at
him
.
M.
Nioche
continued
to
stare
;
he
appeared
afraid
to
move
,
even
*NL*
to
the
extent
of
evading
Newman
's
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
''
said
Newman
;
``
are
you
here
,
too
?
''
And
he
looked
at
his
*NL*
neighbor
's
helplessness
more
grimly
than
he
knew
.
M.
Nioche
had
a
new
*NL*
hat
and
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
;
his
clothes
,
too
,
seemed
to
belong
to
a
*NL*
more
recent
antiquity
than
of
yore
.
Over
his
arm
was
suspended
a
lady
's
*NL*
mantilla
--
a
light
and
brilliant
tissue
,
fringed
with
white
lace
--
which
*NL*
had
apparently
been
committed
to
his
keeping
;
and
the
little
dog
's
blue
*NL*
ribbon
was
wound
tightly
round
his
hand
.
There
was
no
expression
of
*NL*
recognition
in
his
face
--
or
of
anything
indeed
save
a
sort
of
feeble
,
*NL*
fascinated
dread
;
Newman
looked
at
the
pug
and
the
lace
mantilla
,
and
*NL*
then
he
met
the
old
man
's
eyes
again
.
``
You
know
me
,
I
see
,
''
he
pursued
.
*NL*
``
You
might
have
spoken
to
me
before
.
''
M.
Nioche
still
said
nothing
,
*NL*
but
it
seemed
to
Newman
that
his
eyes
began
faintly
to
water
.
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
expect
,
''
our
hero
went
on
,
``
to
meet
you
so
far
from
--
from
the
Cafe
de
la
*NL*
Patrie
.
''
The
old
man
remained
silent
,
but
decidedly
Newman
had
touched
*NL*
the
source
of
tears
.
His
neighbor
sat
staring
and
Newman
added
,
``
What
's
*NL*
the
matter
,
M.
Nioche
?
You
used
to
talk
--
to
talk
very
prettily
.
Do
n't
*NL*
you
remember
you
even
gave
lessons
in
conversation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
M.
Nioche
decided
to
change
his
attitude
.
He
stooped
and
picked
*NL*
up
the
pug
,
lifted
it
to
his
face
and
wiped
his
eyes
on
its
little
soft
*NL*
back
.
``
I
'm
afraid
to
speak
to
you
,
''
he
presently
said
,
looking
over
the
*NL*
puppy
's
shoulder
.
``
I
hoped
you
would
n't
notice
me
.
I
should
have
moved
*NL*
away
,
but
I
was
afraid
that
if
I
moved
you
would
notice
me
.
So
I
sat
*NL*
very
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
you
have
a
bad
conscience
,
sir
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
put
down
the
little
dog
and
held
it
carefully
in
his
lap
.
*NL*
Then
he
shook
his
head
,
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
interlocutor
.
*NL*
``
No
,
Mr.
Newman
,
I
have
a
good
conscience
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
should
you
want
to
slink
away
from
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
because
you
do
n't
understand
my
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
you
once
explained
it
to
me
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
But
it
seems
*NL*
improved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Improved
!
''
exclaimed
M.
Nioche
,
under
his
breath
.
``
Do
you
call
this
*NL*
improvement
?
''
And
he
glanced
at
the
treasures
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
are
on
your
travels
,
''
Newman
rejoined
.
``
A
visit
to
London
in
*NL*
the
season
is
certainly
a
sign
of
prosperity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
,
in
answer
to
this
cruel
piece
of
irony
,
lifted
the
puppy
up
*NL*
to
his
face
again
,
peering
at
Newman
with
his
small
blank
eye-holes
.
*NL*
There
was
something
almost
imbecile
in
the
movement
,
and
Newman
hardly
*NL*
knew
whether
he
was
taking
refuge
in
a
convenient
affectation
of
*NL*
unreason
,
or
whether
he
had
in
fact
paid
for
his
dishonor
by
the
loss
of
*NL*
his
wits
.
In
the
latter
case
,
just
now
,
he
felt
little
more
tenderly
*NL*
to
the
foolish
old
man
than
in
the
former
.
Responsible
or
not
,
he
was
*NL*
equally
an
accomplice
of
his
detestably
mischievous
daughter
.
Newman
*NL*
was
going
to
leave
him
abruptly
,
when
a
ray
of
entreaty
appeared
to
*NL*
disengage
itself
from
the
old
man
's
misty
gaze
.
``
Are
you
going
away
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
stay
?
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
left
you
--
from
consideration
.
But
my
dignity
suffers
at
*NL*
your
leaving
me
--
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
anything
particular
to
say
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
looked
around
him
to
see
that
no
one
was
listening
,
and
then
*NL*
he
said
,
very
softly
but
distinctly
,
``
I
have
NOT
forgiven
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
gave
a
short
laugh
,
but
the
old
man
seemed
for
the
moment
not
to
*NL*
perceive
it
;
he
was
gazing
away
,
absently
,
at
some
metaphysical
image
*NL*
of
his
implacability
.
``
It
does
n't
much
matter
whether
you
forgive
her
or
*NL*
not
,
''
said
Newman
.
``
There
are
other
people
who
wo
n't
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
she
done
?
''
M.
Nioche
softly
questioned
,
turning
round
again
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
she
does
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
done
a
devilish
mischief
;
it
does
n't
matter
what
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
``
She
's
a
nuisance
;
she
ought
to
be
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Nioche
stealthily
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
very
gently
upon
*NL*
Newman
's
arm
.
``
Stopped
,
yes
,
''
he
whispered
.
``
That
's
it
.
Stopped
short
.
*NL*
She
is
running
away
--
she
must
be
stopped
.
''
Then
he
paused
a
moment
and
*NL*
looked
round
him
.
``
I
mean
to
stop
her
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
am
only
waiting
*NL*
for
my
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Newman
,
laughing
briefly
again
.
``
She
is
running
away
and
*NL*
you
are
running
after
her
.
You
have
run
a
long
distance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
M.
Nioche
stared
insistently
:
``
I
shall
stop
her
!
''
he
softly
*NL*
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
spoken
when
the
crowd
in
front
of
them
separated
,
as
if
by
*NL*
the
impulse
to
make
way
for
an
important
personage
.
Presently
,
through
*NL*
the
opening
,
advanced
Mademoiselle
Nioche
,
attended
by
the
gentleman
*NL*
whom
Newman
had
lately
observed
.
His
face
being
now
presented
to
our
*NL*
hero
,
the
latter
recognized
the
irregular
features
,
the
hardly
more
*NL*
regular
complexion
,
and
the
amiable
expression
of
Lord
Deepmere
.
Noemie
,
*NL*
on
finding
herself
suddenly
confronted
with
Newman
,
who
,
like
M.
Nioche
,
*NL*
had
risen
from
his
seat
,
faltered
for
a
barely
perceptible
instant
.
She
*NL*
gave
him
a
little
nod
,
as
if
she
had
seen
him
yesterday
,
and
then
,
with
*NL*
a
good-natured
smile
,
``
Tiens
,
how
we
keep
meeting
!
''
she
said
.
She
looked
*NL*
consummately
pretty
,
and
the
front
of
her
dress
was
a
wonderful
work
of
*NL*
art
.
She
went
up
to
her
father
,
stretching
out
her
hands
for
the
little
*NL*
dog
,
which
he
submissively
placed
in
them
,
and
she
began
to
kiss
it
*NL*
and
murmur
over
it
:
``
To
think
of
leaving
him
all
alone
,
--
what
a
wicked
,
*NL*
abominable
creature
he
must
believe
me
!
He
has
been
very
unwell
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
turning
and
affecting
to
explain
to
Newman
,
with
a
spark
of
*NL*
infernal
impudence
,
fine
as
a
needlepoint
,
in
her
eye
.
``
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
the
English
climate
agrees
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
agree
wonderfully
well
with
his
mistress
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
me
?
I
have
never
been
better
,
thank
you
,
''
Miss
Noemie
*NL*
declared
.
``
But
with
MILORD
''
--
and
she
gave
a
brilliant
glance
at
her
*NL*
late
companion
--
``
how
can
one
help
being
well
?
''
She
seated
herself
in
the
*NL*
chair
from
which
her
father
had
risen
,
and
began
to
arrange
the
little
*NL*
dog
's
rosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Deepmere
carried
off
such
embarrassment
as
might
be
incidental
*NL*
to
this
unexpected
encounter
with
the
inferior
grace
of
a
male
and
*NL*
a
Briton
.
He
blushed
a
good
deal
,
and
greeted
the
object
of
his
late
*NL*
momentary
aspiration
to
rivalry
in
the
favor
of
a
person
other
than
*NL*
the
mistress
of
the
invalid
pug
with
an
awkward
nod
and
a
rapid
*NL*
ejaculation
--
an
ejaculation
to
which
Newman
,
who
often
found
it
hard
to
*NL*
understand
the
speech
of
English
people
,
was
able
to
attach
no
meaning
.
*NL*
Then
the
young
man
stood
there
,
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
,
and
with
a
*NL*
conscious
grin
,
staring
askance
at
Miss
Noemie
.
Suddenly
an
idea
seemed
*NL*
to
strike
him
,
and
he
said
,
turning
to
Newman
,
``
Oh
,
you
know
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
I
know
her
.
I
do
n't
believe
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
,
I
do
!
''
said
Lord
Deepmere
,
with
another
grin
.
``
I
knew
*NL*
her
in
Paris
--
by
my
poor
cousin
Bellegarde
you
know
.
He
knew
her
,
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
did
n't
he
?
It
was
she
you
know
,
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
*NL*
affair
.
Awfully
sad
,
was
n't
it
?
''
continued
the
young
man
,
talking
off
*NL*
his
embarrassment
as
his
simple
nature
permitted
.
``
They
got
up
some
*NL*
story
about
its
being
for
the
Pope
;
about
the
other
man
having
said
*NL*
something
against
the
Pope
's
morals
.
They
always
do
that
,
you
know
.
They
*NL*
put
it
on
the
Pope
because
Bellegarde
was
once
in
the
Zouaves
.
But
*NL*
it
was
about
HER
morals
--
SHE
was
the
Pope
!
''
Lord
Deepmere
pursued
,
*NL*
directing
an
eye
illumined
by
this
pleasantry
toward
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Nioche
,
who
was
bending
gracefully
over
her
lap-dog
,
apparently
absorbed
*NL*
in
conversation
with
it
.
``
I
dare
say
you
think
it
rather
odd
that
I
*NL*
should
--
a
--
keep
up
the
acquaintance
,
''
the
young
man
resumed
.
``
But
she
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
,
you
know
,
and
Bellegarde
was
only
my
twentieth
cousin
.
*NL*
I
dare
say
you
think
it
's
rather
cheeky
,
my
showing
with
her
in
Hyde
*NL*
Park
.
But
you
see
she
is
n't
known
yet
,
and
she
's
in
such
very
good
*NL*
form
''
--
And
Lord
Deepmere
's
conclusion
was
lost
in
the
attesting
glance
*NL*
which
he
again
directed
toward
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
turned
away
;
he
was
having
more
of
her
than
he
relished
.
M.
*NL*
Nioche
had
stepped
aside
on
his
daughter
's
approach
,
and
he
stood
there
,
*NL*
within
a
very
small
compass
,
looking
down
hard
at
the
ground
.
It
had
*NL*
never
yet
,
as
between
him
and
Newman
,
been
so
apposite
to
place
on
*NL*
record
the
fact
that
he
had
not
forgiven
his
daughter
.
As
Newman
was
*NL*
moving
away
he
looked
up
and
drew
near
to
him
,
and
Newman
,
seeing
the
*NL*
old
man
had
something
particular
to
say
,
bent
his
head
for
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
it
some
day
in
the
papers
,
''
'
murmured
M.
Nioche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
hero
departed
to
hide
his
smile
,
and
to
this
day
,
though
the
*NL*
newspapers
form
his
principal
reading
,
his
eyes
have
not
been
arrested
*NL*
by
any
paragraph
forming
a
sequel
to
this
announcement
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
uninitiated
observation
of
the
great
spectacle
of
English
life
*NL*
upon
which
I
have
touched
,
it
might
be
supposed
that
Newman
passed
a
*NL*
great
many
dull
days
.
But
the
dullness
of
his
days
pleased
him
;
his
*NL*
melancholy
,
which
was
settling
into
a
secondary
stage
,
like
a
healing
*NL*
wound
,
had
in
it
a
certain
acrid
,
palatable
sweetness
.
He
had
company
in
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
and
for
the
present
he
wanted
no
other
.
He
had
no
desire
*NL*
to
make
acquaintances
,
and
he
left
untouched
a
couple
of
notes
of
*NL*
introduction
which
had
been
sent
him
by
Tom
Tristram
.
He
thought
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
Madame
de
Cintre
--
sometimes
with
a
dogged
tranquillity
which
*NL*
might
have
seemed
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
,
a
near
neighbor
*NL*
to
forgetfulness
.
He
lived
over
again
the
happiest
hours
he
had
*NL*
known
--
that
silver
chain
of
numbered
days
in
which
his
afternoon
visits
,
*NL*
tending
sensibly
to
the
ideal
result
,
had
subtilized
his
good
humor
to
*NL*
a
sort
of
spiritual
intoxication
.
He
came
back
to
reality
,
after
such
*NL*
reveries
,
with
a
somewhat
muffled
shock
;
he
had
begun
to
feel
the
need
*NL*
of
accepting
the
unchangeable
.
At
other
times
the
reality
became
an
*NL*
infamy
again
and
the
unchangeable
an
imposture
,
and
he
gave
himself
up
*NL*
to
his
angry
restlessness
till
he
was
weary
.
But
on
the
whole
he
fell
*NL*
into
a
rather
reflective
mood
.
Without
in
the
least
intending
it
or
*NL*
knowing
it
,
he
attempted
to
read
the
moral
of
his
strange
misadventure
.
*NL*
He
asked
himself
,
in
his
quieter
hours
,
whether
perhaps
,
after
all
,
he
*NL*
WAS
more
commercial
than
was
pleasant
.
We
know
that
it
was
in
obedience
*NL*
to
a
strong
reaction
against
questions
exclusively
commercial
that
*NL*
he
had
come
out
to
pick
up
aesthetic
entertainment
in
Europe
;
it
may
*NL*
therefore
be
understood
that
he
was
able
to
conceive
that
a
man
might
be
*NL*
too
commercial
.
He
was
very
willing
to
grant
it
,
but
the
concession
,
as
*NL*
to
his
own
case
,
was
not
made
with
any
very
oppressive
sense
of
shame
.
*NL*
If
he
had
been
too
commercial
,
he
was
ready
to
forget
it
,
for
in
being
*NL*
so
he
had
done
no
man
any
wrong
that
might
not
be
as
easily
forgotten
.
*NL*
He
reflected
with
sober
placidity
that
at
least
there
were
no
monuments
*NL*
of
his
``
meanness
''
scattered
about
the
world
.
If
there
was
any
reason
in
*NL*
the
nature
of
things
why
his
connection
with
business
should
have
cast
a
*NL*
shadow
upon
a
connection
--
even
a
connection
broken
--
with
a
woman
justly
*NL*
proud
,
he
was
willing
to
sponge
it
out
of
his
life
forever
.
The
thing
*NL*
seemed
a
possibility
;
he
could
not
feel
it
,
doubtless
,
as
keenly
as
some
*NL*
people
,
and
it
hardly
seemed
worth
while
to
flap
his
wings
very
hard
to
*NL*
rise
to
the
idea
;
but
he
could
feel
it
enough
to
make
any
sacrifice
that
*NL*
still
remained
to
be
made
.
As
to
what
such
sacrifice
was
now
to
be
*NL*
made
to
,
here
Newman
stopped
short
before
a
blank
wall
over
which
there
*NL*
sometimes
played
a
shadowy
imagery
.
He
had
a
fancy
of
carrying
out
his
*NL*
life
as
he
would
have
directed
it
if
Madame
de
Cintre
had
been
left
to
*NL*
him
--
of
making
it
a
religion
to
do
nothing
that
she
would
have
disliked
.
*NL*
In
this
,
certainly
,
there
was
no
sacrifice
;
but
there
was
a
pale
,
*NL*
oblique
ray
of
inspiration
.
It
would
be
lonely
entertainment
--
a
good
*NL*
deal
like
a
man
talking
to
himself
in
the
mirror
for
want
of
better
*NL*
company
.
Yet
the
idea
yielded
Newman
several
half
hours
'
dumb
exaltation
*NL*
as
he
sat
,
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
legs
stretched
,
*NL*
over
the
relics
of
an
expensively
poor
dinner
,
in
the
undying
English
*NL*
twilight
.
If
,
however
,
his
commercial
imagination
was
dead
,
he
felt
no
*NL*
contempt
for
the
surviving
actualities
begotten
by
it
.
He
was
glad
he
*NL*
had
been
prosperous
and
had
been
a
great
man
of
business
rather
than
a
*NL*
small
one
;
he
was
extremely
glad
he
was
rich
.
He
felt
no
impulse
to
sell
*NL*
all
he
had
and
give
to
the
poor
,
or
to
retire
into
meditative
economy
*NL*
and
asceticism
.
He
was
glad
he
was
rich
and
tolerably
young
;
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
think
too
much
about
buying
and
selling
,
it
was
a
gain
to
*NL*
have
a
good
slice
of
life
left
in
which
not
to
think
about
them
.
Come
,
*NL*
what
should
he
think
about
now
?
Again
and
again
Newman
could
think
only
*NL*
of
one
thing
;
his
thoughts
always
came
back
to
it
,
and
as
they
did
so
,
*NL*
with
an
emotional
rush
which
seemed
physically
to
express
itself
in
a
*NL*
sudden
upward
choking
,
he
leaned
forward
--
the
waiter
having
left
the
*NL*
room
--
and
,
resting
his
arms
on
the
table
,
buried
his
troubled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
England
till
midsummer
,
and
spent
a
month
in
the
country
,
*NL*
wandering
about
cathedrals
,
castles
,
and
ruins
.
Several
times
,
taking
*NL*
a
walk
from
his
inn
into
meadows
and
parks
,
he
stopped
by
a
well-worn
*NL*
stile
,
looked
across
through
the
early
evening
at
a
gray
church
tower
,
*NL*
with
its
dusky
nimbus
of
thick-circling
swallows
,
and
remembered
that
*NL*
this
might
have
been
part
of
the
entertainment
of
his
honeymoon
.
He
had
*NL*
never
been
so
much
alone
or
indulged
so
little
in
accidental
dialogue
.
*NL*
The
period
of
recreation
appointed
by
Mrs.
Tristram
had
at
last
expired
,
*NL*
and
he
asked
himself
what
he
should
do
now
.
Mrs.
Tristram
had
written
*NL*
to
him
,
proposing
to
him
that
he
should
join
her
in
the
Pyrenees
;
but
*NL*
he
was
not
in
the
humor
to
return
to
France
.
The
simplest
thing
was
to
*NL*
repair
to
Liverpool
and
embark
on
the
first
American
steamer
.
Newman
*NL*
made
his
way
to
the
great
seaport
and
secured
his
berth
;
and
the
night
*NL*
before
sailing
he
sat
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
,
staring
down
,
vacantly
*NL*
and
wearily
,
at
an
open
portmanteau
.
A
number
of
papers
were
lying
*NL*
upon
it
,
which
he
had
been
meaning
to
look
over
;
some
of
them
might
*NL*
conveniently
be
destroyed
.
But
at
last
he
shuffled
them
roughly
*NL*
together
,
and
pushed
them
into
a
corner
of
the
valise
;
they
were
*NL*
business
papers
,
and
he
was
in
no
humor
for
sifting
them
.
Then
he
drew
*NL*
forth
his
pocket-book
and
took
out
a
paper
of
smaller
size
than
those
he
*NL*
had
dismissed
.
He
did
not
unfold
it
;
he
simply
sat
looking
at
the
back
*NL*
of
it
.
If
he
had
momentarily
entertained
the
idea
of
destroying
it
,
the
*NL*
idea
quickly
expired
.
What
the
paper
suggested
was
the
feeling
that
*NL*
lay
in
his
innermost
heart
and
that
no
reviving
cheerfulness
could
long
*NL*
quench
--
the
feeling
that
after
all
and
above
all
he
was
a
good
fellow
*NL*
wronged
.
With
it
came
a
hearty
hope
that
the
Bellegardes
were
enjoying
*NL*
their
suspense
as
to
what
he
would
do
yet
.
The
more
it
was
prolonged
the
*NL*
more
they
would
enjoy
it
!
He
had
hung
fire
once
,
yes
;
perhaps
,
in
his
*NL*
present
queer
state
of
mind
,
he
might
hang
fire
again
.
But
he
restored
*NL*
the
little
paper
to
his
pocket-book
very
tenderly
,
and
felt
better
for
*NL*
thinking
of
the
suspense
of
the
Bellegardes
.
He
felt
better
every
time
*NL*
he
thought
of
it
after
that
,
as
he
sailed
the
summer
seas
.
He
landed
*NL*
in
New
York
and
journeyed
across
the
continent
to
San
Francisco
,
and
*NL*
nothing
that
he
observed
by
the
way
contributed
to
mitigate
his
sense
of
*NL*
being
a
good
fellow
wronged
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
a
great
many
other
good
fellows
--
his
old
friends
--
but
he
told
*NL*
none
of
them
of
the
trick
that
had
been
played
him
.
He
said
simply
that
*NL*
the
lady
he
was
to
have
married
had
changed
her
mind
,
and
when
he
*NL*
was
asked
if
he
had
changed
his
own
,
he
said
,
``
Suppose
we
change
the
*NL*
subject
.
''
He
told
his
friends
that
he
had
brought
home
no
``
new
ideas
''
*NL*
from
Europe
,
and
his
conduct
probably
struck
them
as
an
eloquent
proof
*NL*
of
failing
invention
.
He
took
no
interest
in
chatting
about
his
affairs
*NL*
and
manifested
no
desire
to
look
over
his
accounts
.
He
asked
half
a
*NL*
dozen
questions
which
,
like
those
of
an
eminent
physician
inquiring
*NL*
for
particular
symptoms
,
showed
that
he
still
knew
what
he
was
talking
*NL*
about
;
but
he
made
no
comments
and
gave
no
directions
.
He
not
only
*NL*
puzzled
the
gentlemen
on
the
stock
exchange
,
but
he
was
himself
*NL*
surprised
at
the
extent
of
his
indifference
.
As
it
seemed
only
to
*NL*
increase
,
he
made
an
effort
to
combat
it
;
he
tried
to
interest
himself
*NL*
and
to
take
up
his
old
occupations
.
But
they
appeared
unreal
to
him
;
do
*NL*
what
he
would
he
somehow
could
not
believe
in
them
.
Sometimes
he
began
*NL*
to
fear
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
head
;
that
his
*NL*
brain
,
perhaps
,
had
softened
,
and
that
the
end
of
his
strong
activities
*NL*
had
come
.
This
idea
came
back
to
him
with
an
exasperating
force
.
*NL*
A
hopeless
,
helpless
loafer
,
useful
to
no
one
and
detestable
to
*NL*
himself
--
this
was
what
the
treachery
of
the
Bellegardes
had
made
of
him
.
*NL*
In
his
restless
idleness
he
came
back
from
San
Francisco
to
New
York
,
*NL*
and
sat
for
three
days
in
the
lobby
of
his
hotel
,
looking
out
through
*NL*
a
huge
wall
of
plate-glass
at
the
unceasing
stream
of
pretty
girls
in
*NL*
Parisian-looking
dresses
,
undulating
past
with
little
parcels
nursed
*NL*
against
their
neat
figures
.
At
the
end
of
three
days
he
returned
to
San
*NL*
Francisco
,
and
having
arrived
there
he
wished
he
had
stayed
away
.
He
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
,
his
occupation
was
gone
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
*NL*
should
never
find
it
again
.
He
had
nothing
to
do
here
,
he
sometimes
said
*NL*
to
himself
;
but
there
was
something
beyond
the
ocean
that
he
was
*NL*
still
to
do
;
something
that
he
had
left
undone
experimentally
and
*NL*
speculatively
,
to
see
if
it
could
content
itself
to
remain
undone
.
But
*NL*
it
was
not
content
:
it
kept
pulling
at
his
heartstrings
and
thumping
at
*NL*
his
reason
;
it
murmured
in
his
ears
and
hovered
perpetually
before
his
*NL*
eyes
.
It
interposed
between
all
new
resolutions
and
their
fulfillment
;
*NL*
it
seemed
like
a
stubborn
ghost
,
dumbly
entreating
to
be
laid
.
Till
that
*NL*
was
done
he
should
never
be
able
to
do
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
toward
the
end
of
the
winter
,
after
a
long
interval
,
he
*NL*
received
a
letter
from
Mrs.
Tristram
,
who
apparently
was
animated
by
a
*NL*
charitable
desire
to
amuse
and
distract
her
correspondent
.
She
gave
*NL*
him
much
Paris
gossip
,
talked
of
General
Packard
and
Miss
Kitty
Upjohn
,
*NL*
enumerated
the
new
plays
at
the
theatre
,
and
inclosed
a
note
from
her
*NL*
husband
,
who
had
gone
down
to
spend
a
month
at
Nice
.
Then
came
her
*NL*
signature
,
and
after
this
her
postscript
.
The
latter
consisted
of
these
*NL*
few
lines
:
``
I
heard
three
days
since
from
my
friend
,
the
Abbe
Aubert
,
*NL*
that
Madame
de
Cintre
last
week
took
the
veil
at
the
Carmelites
.
It
was
*NL*
on
her
twenty-seventh
birthday
,
and
she
took
the
name
of
her
,
patroness
,
*NL*
St.
Veronica
.
Sister
Veronica
has
a
life-time
before
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
came
to
Newman
in
the
morning
;
in
the
evening
he
started
for
*NL*
Paris
.
His
wound
began
to
ache
with
its
first
fierceness
,
and
during
his
*NL*
long
bleak
journey
the
thought
of
Madame
de
Cintre
's
``
life-time
,
''
*NL*
passed
within
prison
walls
on
whose
outer
side
he
might
stand
,
kept
him
*NL*
perpetual
company
.
Now
he
would
fix
himself
in
Paris
forever
;
he
would
*NL*
extort
a
sort
of
happiness
from
the
knowledge
that
if
she
was
not
*NL*
there
,
at
least
the
stony
sepulchre
that
held
her
was
.
He
descended
,
*NL*
unannounced
,
upon
Mrs.
Bread
,
whom
he
found
keeping
lonely
watch
in
his
*NL*
great
empty
saloons
on
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
.
They
were
as
neat
as
a
*NL*
Dutch
village
,
Mrs.
Bread
's
only
occupation
had
been
removing
individual
*NL*
dust-particles
.
She
made
no
complaint
,
however
,
of
her
loneliness
,
for
*NL*
in
her
philosophy
a
servant
was
but
a
mysteriously
projected
machine
,
*NL*
and
it
would
be
as
fantastic
for
a
housekeeper
to
comment
upon
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
absences
as
for
a
clock
to
remark
upon
not
being
wound
up
.
*NL*
No
particular
clock
,
Mrs.
Bread
supposed
,
went
all
the
time
,
and
no
*NL*
particular
servant
could
enjoy
all
the
sunshine
diffused
by
the
career
*NL*
of
an
exacting
master
.
She
ventured
,
nevertheless
,
to
express
a
modest
*NL*
hope
that
Newman
meant
to
remain
a
while
in
Paris
.
Newman
laid
his
hand
*NL*
on
hers
and
shook
it
gently
.
``
I
mean
to
remain
forever
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
after
this
to
see
Mrs.
Tristram
,
to
whom
he
had
telegraphed
,
and
*NL*
who
expected
him
.
She
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
shook
her
head
.
``
This
*NL*
wo
n't
do
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
have
come
back
too
soon
.
''
He
sat
down
and
*NL*
asked
about
her
husband
and
her
children
,
tried
even
to
inquire
about
*NL*
Miss
Dora
Finch
.
In
the
midst
of
this
--
``
Do
you
know
where
she
is
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
hesitated
a
moment
;
of
course
he
could
n't
mean
Miss
Dora
*NL*
Finch
.
Then
she
answered
,
properly
:
``
She
has
gone
to
the
other
house
--
in
*NL*
the
Rue
d'Enfer
.
''
After
Newman
had
sat
a
while
longer
looking
very
*NL*
sombre
,
she
went
on
:
``
You
are
not
so
good
a
man
as
I
thought
.
You
are
*NL*
more
--
you
are
more
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
what
?
''
Newman
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
unforgiving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
cried
Newman
;
``
do
you
expect
me
to
forgive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
.
I
have
forgiven
,
so
of
course
you
ca
n't
.
But
you
might
*NL*
forget
!
You
have
a
worse
temper
about
it
than
I
should
have
expected
.
*NL*
You
look
wicked
--
you
look
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
be
dangerous
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
I
am
not
wicked
.
No
,
I
am
not
*NL*
wicked
.
''
And
he
got
up
to
go
.
Mrs.
Tristram
asked
him
to
come
back
to
*NL*
dinner
;
but
he
answered
that
he
did
not
feel
like
pledging
himself
to
*NL*
be
present
at
an
entertainment
,
even
as
a
solitary
guest
.
Later
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
if
he
should
be
able
,
he
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
away
through
the
city
,
beside
the
Seine
and
over
it
,
and
took
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
Rue
d'Enfer
.
The
day
had
the
softness
of
early
*NL*
spring
;
but
the
weather
was
gray
and
humid
.
Newman
found
himself
in
a
*NL*
part
of
Paris
which
he
little
knew
--
a
region
of
convents
and
prisons
,
of
*NL*
streets
bordered
by
long
dead
walls
and
traversed
by
a
few
wayfarers
.
*NL*
At
the
intersection
of
two
of
these
streets
stood
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Carmelites
--
a
dull
,
plain
edifice
,
with
a
high-shouldered
blank
wall
*NL*
all
round
it
.
From
without
Newman
could
see
its
upper
windows
,
its
steep
*NL*
roof
and
its
chimneys
.
But
these
things
revealed
no
symptoms
of
human
*NL*
life
;
the
place
looked
dumb
,
deaf
,
inanimate
.
The
pale
,
dead
,
discolored
*NL*
wall
stretched
beneath
it
,
far
down
the
empty
side
street
--
a
vista
*NL*
without
a
human
figure
.
Newman
stood
there
a
long
time
;
there
were
*NL*
no
passers
;
he
was
free
to
gaze
his
fill
.
This
seemed
the
goal
of
his
*NL*
journey
;
it
was
what
he
had
come
for
.
It
was
a
strange
satisfaction
,
and
*NL*
yet
it
was
a
satisfaction
;
the
barren
stillness
of
the
place
seemed
to
*NL*
be
his
own
release
from
ineffectual
longing
.
It
told
him
that
the
woman
*NL*
within
was
lost
beyond
recall
,
and
that
the
days
and
years
of
the
future
*NL*
would
pile
themselves
above
her
like
the
huge
immovable
slab
of
a
tomb
.
*NL*
These
days
and
years
,
in
this
place
,
would
always
be
just
so
gray
and
*NL*
silent
.
Suddenly
,
from
the
thought
of
their
seeing
him
stand
there
,
*NL*
again
the
charm
utterly
departed
.
He
would
never
stand
there
again
;
it
*NL*
was
gratuitous
dreariness
.
He
turned
away
with
a
heavy
heart
,
but
with
*NL*
a
heart
lighter
than
the
one
he
had
brought
.
Everything
was
over
,
and
he
*NL*
too
at
last
could
rest
.
He
walked
down
through
narrow
,
winding
streets
*NL*
to
the
edge
of
the
Seine
again
,
and
there
he
saw
,
close
above
him
,
the
*NL*
soft
,
vast
towers
of
Notre
Dame
.
He
crossed
one
of
the
bridges
and
stood
*NL*
a
moment
in
the
empty
place
before
the
great
cathedral
;
then
he
went
*NL*
in
beneath
the
grossly-imaged
portals
.
He
wandered
some
distance
up
the
*NL*
nave
and
sat
down
in
the
splendid
dimness
.
He
sat
a
long
time
;
he
heard
*NL*
far-away
bells
chiming
off
,
at
long
intervals
,
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
*NL*
He
was
very
tired
;
this
was
the
best
place
he
could
be
in
.
He
said
no
*NL*
prayers
;
he
had
no
prayers
to
say
.
He
had
nothing
to
be
thankful
for
,
*NL*
and
he
had
nothing
to
ask
;
nothing
to
ask
,
because
now
he
must
take
care
*NL*
of
himself
.
But
a
great
cathedral
offers
a
very
various
hospitality
,
and
*NL*
Newman
sat
in
his
place
,
because
while
he
was
there
he
was
out
of
the
*NL*
world
.
The
most
unpleasant
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
had
*NL*
reached
its
formal
conclusion
,
as
it
were
;
he
could
close
the
book
and
*NL*
put
it
away
.
He
leaned
his
head
for
a
long
time
on
the
chair
in
front
of
*NL*
him
;
when
he
took
it
up
he
felt
that
he
was
himself
again
.
Somewhere
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
a
tight
knot
seemed
to
have
loosened
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
Bellegardes
;
he
had
almost
forgotten
them
.
He
remembered
them
as
people
*NL*
he
had
meant
to
do
something
to
.
He
gave
a
groan
as
he
remembered
what
*NL*
he
had
meant
to
do
;
he
was
annoyed
at
having
meant
to
do
it
;
the
bottom
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
had
fallen
out
of
his
revenge
.
Whether
it
was
Christian
*NL*
charity
or
unregenerate
good
nature
--
what
it
was
,
in
the
background
of
*NL*
his
soul
--
I
do
n't
pretend
to
say
;
but
Newman
's
last
thought
was
that
*NL*
of
course
he
would
let
the
Bellegardes
go
.
If
he
had
spoken
it
aloud
*NL*
he
would
have
said
that
he
did
n't
want
to
hurt
them
.
He
was
ashamed
*NL*
of
having
wanted
to
hurt
them
.
They
had
hurt
him
,
but
such
things
were
*NL*
really
not
his
game
.
At
last
he
got
up
and
came
out
of
the
darkening
*NL*
church
;
not
with
the
elastic
step
of
a
man
who
had
won
a
victory
or
*NL*
taken
a
resolve
,
but
strolling
soberly
,
like
a
good-natured
man
who
is
*NL*
still
a
little
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
home
,
he
said
to
Mrs.
Bread
that
he
must
trouble
her
to
put
back
*NL*
his
things
into
the
portmanteau
she
had
unpacked
the
evening
before
.
His
*NL*
gentle
stewardess
looked
at
him
through
eyes
a
trifle
bedimmed
.
``
Dear
*NL*
me
,
sir
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
thought
you
said
that
you
were
going
to
stay
*NL*
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
that
I
was
going
to
stay
away
forever
,
''
said
Newman
kindly
.
And
*NL*
since
his
departure
from
Paris
on
the
following
day
he
has
certainly
not
*NL*
returned
.
The
gilded
apartments
I
have
so
often
spoken
of
stand
ready
to
*NL*
receive
him
;
but
they
serve
only
as
a
spacious
residence
for
Mrs.
Bread
,
*NL*
who
wanders
eternally
from
room
to
room
,
adjusting
the
tassels
of
the
*NL*
curtains
,
and
keeps
her
wages
,
which
are
regularly
brought
her
by
*NL*
a
banker
's
clerk
,
in
a
great
pink
Sevres
vase
on
the
drawing-room
*NL*
mantel-shelf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
evening
Newman
went
to
Mrs.
Tristram
's
and
found
Tom
*NL*
Tristram
by
the
domestic
fireside
.
``
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
back
in
Paris
,
''
*NL*
this
gentleman
declared
.
``
You
know
it
's
really
the
only
place
for
a
*NL*
white
man
to
live
.
''
Mr.
Tristram
made
his
friend
welcome
,
according
*NL*
to
his
own
rosy
light
,
and
offered
him
a
convenient
resume
of
the
*NL*
Franco-American
gossip
of
the
last
six
months
.
Then
at
last
he
got
up
*NL*
and
said
he
would
go
for
half
an
hour
to
the
club
.
``
I
suppose
a
man
*NL*
who
has
been
for
six
months
in
California
wants
a
little
intellectual
*NL*
conversation
.
I
'll
let
my
wife
have
a
go
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
shook
hands
heartily
with
his
host
,
but
did
not
ask
him
to
*NL*
remain
;
and
then
he
relapsed
into
his
place
on
the
sofa
,
opposite
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
.
She
presently
asked
him
what
he
had
done
after
leaving
*NL*
her
.
``
Nothing
particular
,
''
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
struck
me
,
''
she
rejoined
,
``
as
a
man
with
a
plot
in
his
head
.
You
*NL*
looked
as
if
you
were
bent
on
some
sinister
errand
,
and
after
you
had
*NL*
left
me
I
wondered
whether
I
ought
to
have
let
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
went
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
--
to
the
Carmelites
,
''
*NL*
said
Newman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
smiled
.
``
What
did
you
do
there
?
*NL*
Try
to
scale
the
wall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
nothing
.
I
looked
at
the
place
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
came
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
gave
him
a
sympathetic
glance
.
``
You
did
n't
happen
to
meet
*NL*
M.
de
Bellegarde
,
''
she
asked
,
``
staring
hopelessly
at
the
convent
wall
as
*NL*
well
?
I
am
told
he
takes
his
sister
's
conduct
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
meet
him
,
I
am
happy
to
say
,
''
Newman
answered
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
in
the
country
,
''
Mrs.
Tristram
went
on
;
``
at
--
what
is
the
name
*NL*
of
the
place
?
--
Fleurieres
.
They
returned
there
at
the
time
you
left
*NL*
Paris
and
have
been
spending
the
year
in
extreme
seclusion
.
The
little
*NL*
marquise
must
enjoy
it
;
I
expect
to
hear
that
she
has
eloped
with
her
*NL*
daughter
's
music-master
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
looking
at
the
light
wood-fire
;
but
he
listened
to
this
with
*NL*
extreme
interest
.
At
last
he
spoke
:
``
I
mean
never
to
mention
the
name
of
*NL*
those
people
again
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
them
.
''
*NL*
And
then
he
took
out
his
pocket-book
and
drew
forth
a
scrap
of
paper
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
it
an
instant
,
then
got
up
and
stood
by
the
fire
.
``
I
am
going
*NL*
to
burn
them
up
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
glad
to
have
you
as
a
witness
.
There
*NL*
they
go
!
''
And
he
tossed
the
paper
into
the
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
sat
with
her
embroidery
needle
suspended
.
``
What
is
that
*NL*
paper
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
leaning
against
the
fire-place
,
stretched
his
arms
and
drew
a
*NL*
longer
breath
than
usual
.
Then
after
a
moment
,
``
I
can
tell
you
now
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
It
was
a
paper
containing
a
secret
of
the
Bellegardes
--
something
*NL*
which
would
damn
them
if
it
were
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
dropped
her
embroidery
with
a
reproachful
moan
.
``
Ah
,
why
*NL*
did
n't
you
show
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
of
showing
it
to
you
--
I
thought
of
showing
it
to
every
one
.
*NL*
I
thought
of
paying
my
debt
to
the
Bellegardes
that
way
.
So
I
told
them
,
*NL*
and
I
frightened
them
.
They
have
been
staying
in
the
country
as
you
tell
*NL*
me
,
to
keep
out
of
the
explosion
.
But
I
have
given
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
began
to
take
slow
stitches
again
.
``
Have
you
quite
given
*NL*
it
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
very
bad
,
this
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
myself
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
I
am
sorry
you
have
given
it
up
.
I
*NL*
should
have
liked
immensely
to
see
your
paper
.
They
have
wronged
me
too
,
*NL*
you
know
,
as
your
sponsor
and
guarantee
,
and
it
would
have
served
for
my
*NL*
revenge
as
well
.
How
did
you
come
into
possession
of
your
secret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
story
.
But
honestly
,
at
any
rate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
knew
you
were
master
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
told
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
how
interesting
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Tristram
.
``
And
you
humbled
them
*NL*
at
your
feet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
was
silent
a
moment
.
``
No
,
not
at
all
.
They
pretended
not
to
*NL*
care
--
not
to
be
afraid
.
But
I
know
they
did
care
--
they
were
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
stared
a
moment
.
``
Yes
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Tristram
resumed
her
slow
stitches
.
``
They
defied
you
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Newman
,
``
it
was
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
tried
by
the
threat
of
exposure
to
make
them
retract
?
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Tristram
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
they
would
n't
.
I
gave
them
their
choice
,
and
they
chose
to
*NL*
take
their
chance
of
bluffing
off
the
charge
and
convicting
me
of
*NL*
fraud
.
But
they
were
frightened
,
''
Newman
added
,
``
and
I
have
had
all
the
*NL*
vengeance
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
most
provoking
,
''
said
Mrs.
Tristram
,
``
to
hear
you
talk
of
the
*NL*
`
charge
'
when
the
charge
is
burnt
up
.
Is
it
quite
consumed
?
''
she
asked
,
*NL*
glancing
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
assured
her
that
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
.
``
Well
then
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
suppose
there
is
no
harm
in
saying
that
you
probably
did
not
*NL*
make
them
so
very
uncomfortable
.
My
impression
would
be
that
since
,
as
*NL*
you
say
,
they
defied
you
,
it
was
because
they
believed
that
,
after
*NL*
all
,
you
would
never
really
come
to
the
point
.
Their
confidence
,
after
*NL*
counsel
taken
of
each
other
,
was
not
in
their
innocence
,
nor
in
their
*NL*
talent
for
bluffing
things
off
;
it
was
in
your
remarkable
good
nature
!
*NL*
You
see
they
were
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Newman
instinctively
turned
to
see
if
the
little
paper
was
in
fact
*NL*
consumed
;
but
there
was
nothing
left
of
it
.
