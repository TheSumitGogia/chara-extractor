Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
families
are
all
alike
;
every
unhappy
family
is
unhappy
in
its
own
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
in
confusion
in
the
Oblonskys
'
house
.
The
wife
had
*NL*
discovered
that
the
husband
was
carrying
on
an
intrigue
with
a
French
*NL*
girl
,
who
had
been
a
governess
in
their
family
,
and
she
had
announced
to
*NL*
her
husband
that
she
could
not
go
on
living
in
the
same
house
with
him
.
*NL*
This
position
of
affairs
had
now
lasted
three
days
,
and
not
only
the
*NL*
husband
and
wife
themselves
,
but
all
the
members
of
their
family
and
*NL*
household
,
were
painfully
conscious
of
it
.
Every
person
in
the
house
*NL*
felt
that
there
was
no
sense
in
their
living
together
,
and
that
the
*NL*
stray
people
brought
together
by
chance
in
any
inn
had
more
in
common
*NL*
with
one
another
than
they
,
the
members
of
the
family
and
household
of
*NL*
the
Oblonskys
.
The
wife
did
not
leave
her
own
room
,
the
husband
had
not
*NL*
been
at
home
for
three
days
.
The
children
ran
wild
all
over
the
house
;
*NL*
the
English
governess
quarreled
with
the
housekeeper
,
and
wrote
to
a
*NL*
friend
asking
her
to
look
out
for
a
new
situation
for
her
;
the
man-cook
*NL*
had
walked
off
the
day
before
just
at
dinner
time
;
the
kitchen-maid
,
and
*NL*
the
coachman
had
given
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
the
quarrel
,
Prince
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
Oblonsky
--
Stiva
,
as
he
was
called
in
the
fashionable
world
--
woke
up
at
*NL*
his
usual
hour
,
that
is
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
not
in
his
*NL*
wife
's
bedroom
,
but
on
the
leather-covered
sofa
in
his
study
.
He
turned
*NL*
over
his
stout
,
well-cared-for
person
on
the
springy
sofa
,
as
though
he
*NL*
would
sink
into
a
long
sleep
again
;
he
vigorously
embraced
the
pillow
on
*NL*
the
other
side
and
buried
his
face
in
it
;
but
all
at
once
he
jumped
up
,
*NL*
sat
up
on
the
sofa
,
and
opened
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
how
was
it
now
?
''
he
thought
,
going
over
his
dream
.
``
Now
,
how
*NL*
was
it
?
To
be
sure
!
Alabin
was
giving
a
dinner
at
Darmstadt
;
no
,
not
*NL*
Darmstadt
,
but
something
American
.
Yes
,
but
then
,
Darmstadt
was
in
*NL*
America
.
Yes
,
Alabin
was
giving
a
dinner
on
glass
tables
,
and
the
tables
*NL*
sang
,
_
Il
mio
tesoro
_
--
not
_
Il
mio
tesoro
_
though
,
but
something
better
,
*NL*
and
there
were
some
sort
of
little
decanters
on
the
table
,
and
they
were
*NL*
women
,
too
,
''
he
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
eyes
twinkled
gaily
,
and
he
pondered
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
nice
,
very
nice
.
There
was
a
great
deal
more
that
was
*NL*
delightful
,
only
there
's
no
putting
it
into
words
,
or
even
expressing
it
*NL*
in
one
's
thoughts
awake
.
''
And
noticing
a
gleam
of
light
peeping
in
*NL*
beside
one
of
the
serge
curtains
,
he
cheerfully
dropped
his
feet
over
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
sofa
,
and
felt
about
with
them
for
his
slippers
,
a
*NL*
present
on
his
last
birthday
,
worked
for
him
by
his
wife
on
gold-colored
*NL*
morocco
.
And
,
as
he
had
done
every
day
for
the
last
nine
years
,
he
*NL*
stretched
out
his
hand
,
without
getting
up
,
towards
the
place
where
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
always
hung
in
his
bedroom
.
And
thereupon
he
suddenly
*NL*
remembered
that
he
was
not
sleeping
in
his
wife
's
room
,
but
in
his
*NL*
study
,
and
why
:
the
smile
vanished
from
his
face
,
he
knitted
his
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
ah
,
ah
!
Oo
!
...
''
he
muttered
,
recalling
everything
that
had
*NL*
happened
.
And
again
every
detail
of
his
quarrel
with
his
wife
was
*NL*
present
to
his
imagination
,
all
the
hopelessness
of
his
position
,
and
*NL*
worst
of
all
,
his
own
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
wo
n't
forgive
me
,
and
she
ca
n't
forgive
me
.
And
the
most
awful
*NL*
thing
about
it
is
that
it
's
all
my
fault
--
all
my
fault
,
though
I
'm
not
*NL*
to
blame
.
That
's
the
point
of
the
whole
situation
,
''
he
reflected
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
oh
,
oh
!
''
he
kept
repeating
in
despair
,
as
he
remembered
the
acutely
*NL*
painful
sensations
caused
him
by
this
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
unpleasant
of
all
was
the
first
minute
when
,
on
coming
,
happy
and
*NL*
good-humored
,
from
the
theater
,
with
a
huge
pear
in
his
hand
for
his
*NL*
wife
,
he
had
not
found
his
wife
in
the
drawing-room
,
to
his
surprise
had
*NL*
not
found
her
in
the
study
either
,
and
saw
her
at
last
in
her
bedroom
*NL*
with
the
unlucky
letter
that
revealed
everything
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
his
Dolly
,
forever
fussing
and
worrying
over
household
details
,
and
*NL*
limited
in
her
ideas
,
as
he
considered
,
was
sitting
perfectly
still
with
*NL*
the
letter
in
her
hand
,
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
horror
,
*NL*
despair
,
and
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
this
?
''
she
asked
,
pointing
to
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
recollection
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
is
so
often
the
case
,
*NL*
was
not
so
much
annoyed
at
the
fact
itself
as
at
the
way
in
which
he
had
*NL*
met
his
wife
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
happened
to
him
at
that
instant
what
does
happen
to
people
when
*NL*
they
are
unexpectedly
caught
in
something
very
disgraceful
.
He
did
not
*NL*
succeed
in
adapting
his
face
to
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
*NL*
towards
his
wife
by
the
discovery
of
his
fault
.
Instead
of
being
hurt
,
*NL*
denying
,
defending
himself
,
begging
forgiveness
,
instead
of
remaining
*NL*
indifferent
even
--
anything
would
have
been
better
than
what
he
did
*NL*
do
--
his
face
utterly
involuntarily
-LRB-
reflex
spinal
action
,
reflected
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
was
fond
of
physiology
-RRB-
--
utterly
involuntarily
*NL*
assumed
its
habitual
,
good-humored
,
and
therefore
idiotic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idiotic
smile
he
could
not
forgive
himself
.
Catching
sight
of
that
*NL*
smile
,
Dolly
shuddered
as
though
at
physical
pain
,
broke
out
with
her
*NL*
characteristic
heat
into
a
flood
of
cruel
words
,
and
rushed
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
Since
then
she
had
refused
to
see
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
that
idiotic
smile
that
's
to
blame
for
it
all
,
''
thought
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
What
's
to
be
done
?
''
he
said
to
himself
in
*NL*
despair
,
and
found
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
a
truthful
man
in
his
relations
with
himself
.
He
*NL*
was
incapable
of
deceiving
himself
and
persuading
himself
that
he
*NL*
repented
of
his
conduct
.
He
could
not
at
this
date
repent
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
,
a
handsome
,
susceptible
man
of
thirty-four
,
was
not
in
love
*NL*
with
his
wife
,
the
mother
of
five
living
and
two
dead
children
,
and
only
*NL*
a
year
younger
than
himself
.
All
he
repented
of
was
that
he
had
not
*NL*
succeeded
better
in
hiding
it
from
his
wife
.
But
he
felt
all
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
his
position
and
was
sorry
for
his
wife
,
his
children
,
and
*NL*
himself
.
Possibly
he
might
have
managed
to
conceal
his
sins
better
from
*NL*
his
wife
if
he
had
anticipated
that
the
knowledge
of
them
would
have
had
*NL*
such
an
effect
on
her
.
He
had
never
clearly
thought
out
the
subject
,
but
*NL*
he
had
vaguely
conceived
that
his
wife
must
long
ago
have
suspected
him
*NL*
of
being
unfaithful
to
her
,
and
shut
her
eyes
to
the
fact
.
He
had
even
*NL*
supposed
that
she
,
a
worn-out
woman
no
longer
young
or
good-looking
,
and
*NL*
in
no
way
remarkable
or
interesting
,
merely
a
good
mother
,
ought
from
a
*NL*
sense
of
fairness
to
take
an
indulgent
view
.
It
had
turned
out
quite
the
*NL*
other
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
awful
!
oh
dear
,
oh
dear
!
awful
!
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
kept
*NL*
repeating
to
himself
,
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
be
done
.
``
And
how
*NL*
well
things
were
going
up
till
now
!
how
well
we
got
on
!
She
was
*NL*
contented
and
happy
in
her
children
;
I
never
interfered
with
her
in
*NL*
anything
;
I
let
her
manage
the
children
and
the
house
just
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
It
's
true
it
's
bad
_
her
_
having
been
a
governess
in
our
house
.
That
's
*NL*
bad
!
There
's
something
common
,
vulgar
,
in
flirting
with
one
's
governess
.
*NL*
But
what
a
governess
!
''
-LRB-
He
vividly
recalled
the
roguish
black
eyes
of
*NL*
Mlle.
Roland
and
her
smile
.
-RRB-
``
But
after
all
,
while
she
was
in
the
house
,
*NL*
I
kept
myself
in
hand
.
And
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
she
's
already
...
*NL*
it
seems
as
if
ill-luck
would
have
it
so
!
Oh
,
oh
!
But
what
,
what
is
to
*NL*
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
solution
,
but
that
universal
solution
which
life
gives
to
*NL*
all
questions
,
even
the
most
complex
and
insoluble
.
That
answer
is
:
one
*NL*
must
live
in
the
needs
of
the
day
--
that
is
,
forget
oneself
.
To
forget
*NL*
himself
in
sleep
was
impossible
now
,
at
least
till
nighttime
;
he
could
*NL*
not
go
back
now
to
the
music
sung
by
the
decanter-women
;
so
he
must
*NL*
forget
himself
in
the
dream
of
daily
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
shall
see
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
himself
,
and
getting
up
*NL*
he
put
on
a
gray
dressing-gown
lined
with
blue
silk
,
tied
the
tassels
in
*NL*
a
knot
,
and
,
drawing
a
deep
breath
of
air
into
his
broad
,
bare
chest
,
he
*NL*
walked
to
the
window
with
his
usual
confident
step
,
turning
out
his
feet
*NL*
that
carried
his
full
frame
so
easily
.
He
pulled
up
the
blind
and
rang
*NL*
the
bell
loudly
.
It
was
at
once
answered
by
the
appearance
of
an
old
*NL*
friend
,
his
valet
,
Matvey
,
carrying
his
clothes
,
his
boots
,
and
a
*NL*
telegram
.
Matvey
was
followed
by
the
barber
with
all
the
necessaries
for
*NL*
shaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
papers
from
the
office
?
''
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
taking
the
telegram
and
seating
himself
at
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
table
,
''
replied
Matvey
,
glancing
with
inquiring
sympathy
at
his
*NL*
master
;
and
,
after
a
short
pause
,
he
added
with
a
sly
smile
,
``
They
've
*NL*
sent
from
the
carriage-jobbers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
made
no
reply
,
he
merely
glanced
at
Matvey
in
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
In
the
glance
,
in
which
their
eyes
met
in
the
*NL*
looking-glass
,
it
was
clear
that
they
understood
one
another
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
eyes
asked
:
``
Why
do
you
tell
me
that
?
do
n't
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matvey
put
his
hands
in
his
jacket
pockets
,
thrust
out
one
leg
,
and
*NL*
gazed
silently
,
good-humoredly
,
with
a
faint
smile
,
at
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
them
to
come
on
Sunday
,
and
till
then
not
to
trouble
you
or
*NL*
themselves
for
nothing
,
''
he
said
.
He
had
obviously
prepared
the
sentence
*NL*
beforehand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
Matvey
wanted
to
make
a
joke
and
attract
*NL*
attention
to
himself
.
Tearing
open
the
telegram
,
he
read
it
through
,
*NL*
guessing
at
the
words
,
misspelt
as
they
always
are
in
telegrams
,
and
his
*NL*
face
brightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matvey
,
my
sister
Anna
Arkadyevna
will
be
here
tomorrow
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
checking
for
a
minute
the
sleek
,
plump
hand
of
the
barber
,
cutting
a
*NL*
pink
path
through
his
long
,
curly
whiskers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
said
Matvey
,
showing
by
this
response
that
he
,
like
his
*NL*
master
,
realized
the
significance
of
this
arrival
--
that
is
,
that
Anna
*NL*
Arkadyevna
,
the
sister
he
was
so
fond
of
,
might
bring
about
a
*NL*
reconciliation
between
husband
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
or
with
her
husband
?
''
inquired
Matvey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
could
not
answer
,
as
the
barber
was
at
work
on
his
*NL*
upper
lip
,
and
he
raised
one
finger
.
Matvey
nodded
at
the
looking-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
.
Is
the
room
to
be
got
ready
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inform
Darya
Alexandrovna
:
where
she
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darya
Alexandrovna
?
''
Matvey
repeated
,
as
though
in
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
inform
her
.
Here
,
take
the
telegram
;
give
it
to
her
,
and
then
do
*NL*
what
she
tells
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
try
it
on
,
''
Matvey
understood
,
but
he
only
said
,
``
Yes
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
already
washed
and
combed
and
ready
to
be
*NL*
dressed
,
when
Matvey
,
stepping
deliberately
in
his
creaky
boots
,
came
*NL*
back
into
the
room
with
the
telegram
in
his
hand
.
The
barber
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darya
Alexandrovna
told
me
to
inform
you
that
she
is
going
away
.
Let
*NL*
him
do
--
that
is
you
--
do
as
he
likes
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
only
with
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
he
watched
his
master
with
*NL*
his
head
on
one
side
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
silent
a
minute
.
Then
a
*NL*
good-humored
and
rather
pitiful
smile
showed
itself
on
his
handsome
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Matvey
?
''
he
said
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
sir
;
she
will
come
round
,
''
said
Matvey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
Who
's
there
?
''
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
hearing
the
*NL*
rustle
of
a
woman
's
dress
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I
,
''
said
a
firm
,
pleasant
,
woman
's
voice
,
and
the
stern
,
*NL*
pockmarked
face
of
Matrona
Philimonovna
,
the
nurse
,
was
thrust
in
at
the
*NL*
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
,
Matrona
?
''
queried
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
going
up
to
*NL*
her
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
completely
in
the
wrong
as
regards
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
was
conscious
of
this
himself
,
almost
every
one
in
the
house
*NL*
-LRB-
even
the
nurse
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
chief
ally
-RRB-
was
on
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
now
?
''
he
asked
disconsolately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
her
,
sir
;
own
your
fault
again
.
Maybe
God
will
aid
you
.
She
is
*NL*
suffering
so
,
it
's
sad
to
see
her
;
and
besides
,
everything
in
the
house
*NL*
is
topsy-turvy
.
You
must
have
pity
,
sir
,
on
the
children
.
Beg
her
*NL*
forgiveness
,
sir
.
There
's
no
help
for
it
!
One
must
take
the
*NL*
consequences
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
wo
n't
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
your
part

God
is
merciful
;
pray
to
God
,
sir

pray
to
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
'll
do
,
you
can
go
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
blushing
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
Well
now
,
do
dress
me
.
''
He
turned
to
Matvey
and
threw
off
his
*NL*
dressing-gown
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matvey
was
already
holding
up
the
shirt
like
a
horse
's
collar
,
and
,
*NL*
blowing
off
some
invisible
speck
,
he
slipped
it
with
obvious
pleasure
*NL*
over
the
well-groomed
body
of
his
master
.

Chapter
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
dressed
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sprinkled
some
scent
on
*NL*
himself
,
pulled
down
his
shirt-cuffs
,
distributed
into
his
pockets
his
*NL*
cigarettes
,
pocketbook
,
matches
,
and
watch
with
its
double
chain
and
*NL*
seals
,
and
shaking
out
his
handkerchief
,
feeling
himself
clean
,
*NL*
fragrant
,
healthy
,
and
physically
at
ease
,
in
spite
of
his
unhappiness
,
*NL*
he
walked
with
a
slight
swing
on
each
leg
into
the
dining-room
,
where
*NL*
coffee
was
already
waiting
for
him
,
and
beside
the
coffee
,
letters
and
*NL*
papers
from
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
the
letters
.
One
was
very
unpleasant
,
from
a
merchant
who
was
*NL*
buying
a
forest
on
his
wife
's
property
.
To
sell
this
forest
was
*NL*
absolutely
essential
;
but
at
present
,
until
he
was
reconciled
with
his
*NL*
wife
,
the
subject
could
not
be
discussed
.
The
most
unpleasant
thing
of
*NL*
all
was
that
his
pecuniary
interests
should
in
this
way
enter
into
the
*NL*
question
of
his
reconciliation
with
his
wife
.
And
the
idea
that
he
might
*NL*
be
led
on
by
his
interests
,
that
he
might
seek
a
reconciliation
with
his
*NL*
wife
on
account
of
the
sale
of
the
forest
--
that
idea
hurt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
his
letters
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
moved
the
*NL*
office-papers
close
to
him
,
rapidly
looked
through
two
pieces
of
*NL*
business
,
made
a
few
notes
with
a
big
pencil
,
and
pushing
away
the
*NL*
papers
,
turned
to
his
coffee
.
As
he
sipped
his
coffee
,
he
opened
a
still
*NL*
damp
morning
paper
,
and
began
reading
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
in
and
read
a
liberal
paper
,
not
an
extreme
*NL*
one
,
but
one
advocating
the
views
held
by
the
majority
.
And
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
science
,
art
,
and
politics
had
no
special
interest
for
*NL*
him
,
he
firmly
held
those
views
on
all
these
subjects
which
were
held
by
*NL*
the
majority
and
by
his
paper
,
and
he
only
changed
them
when
the
*NL*
majority
changed
them
--
or
,
more
strictly
speaking
,
he
did
not
change
*NL*
them
,
but
they
imperceptibly
changed
of
themselves
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
not
chosen
his
political
opinions
or
his
views
;
*NL*
these
political
opinions
and
views
had
come
to
him
of
themselves
,
just
*NL*
as
he
did
not
choose
the
shapes
of
his
hat
and
coat
,
but
simply
took
*NL*
those
that
were
being
worn
.
And
for
him
,
living
in
a
certain
*NL*
society
--
owing
to
the
need
,
ordinarily
developed
at
years
of
discretion
,
*NL*
for
some
degree
of
mental
activity
--
to
have
views
was
just
as
*NL*
indispensable
as
to
have
a
hat
.
If
there
was
a
reason
for
his
preferring
*NL*
liberal
to
conservative
views
,
which
were
held
also
by
many
of
his
*NL*
circle
,
it
arose
not
from
his
considering
liberalism
more
rational
,
but
*NL*
from
its
being
in
closer
accordance
with
his
manner
of
life
.
The
liberal
*NL*
party
said
that
in
Russia
everything
is
wrong
,
and
certainly
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
had
many
debts
and
was
decidedly
short
of
money
.
The
*NL*
liberal
party
said
that
marriage
is
an
institution
quite
out
of
date
,
*NL*
and
that
it
needs
reconstruction
;
and
family
life
certainly
afforded
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
little
gratification
,
and
forced
him
into
lying
and
*NL*
hypocrisy
,
which
was
so
repulsive
to
his
nature
.
The
liberal
party
said
,
*NL*
or
rather
allowed
it
to
be
understood
,
that
religion
is
only
a
curb
to
*NL*
keep
in
check
the
barbarous
classes
of
the
people
;
and
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
could
not
get
through
even
a
short
service
without
his
legs
*NL*
aching
from
standing
up
,
and
could
never
make
out
what
was
the
object
of
*NL*
all
the
terrible
and
high-flown
language
about
another
world
when
life
*NL*
might
be
so
very
amusing
in
this
world
.
And
with
all
this
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
who
liked
a
joke
,
was
fond
of
puzzling
a
plain
man
by
*NL*
saying
that
if
he
prided
himself
on
his
origin
,
he
ought
not
to
stop
at
*NL*
Rurik
and
disown
the
first
founder
of
his
family
--
the
monkey
.
And
so
*NL*
Liberalism
had
become
a
habit
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
,
and
he
liked
his
*NL*
newspaper
,
as
he
did
his
cigar
after
dinner
,
for
the
slight
fog
it
*NL*
diffused
in
his
brain
.
He
read
the
leading
article
,
in
which
it
was
*NL*
maintained
that
it
was
quite
senseless
in
our
day
to
raise
an
outcry
*NL*
that
radicalism
was
threatening
to
swallow
up
all
conservative
elements
,
*NL*
and
that
the
government
ought
to
take
measures
to
crush
the
*NL*
revolutionary
hydra
;
that
,
on
the
contrary
,
``
in
our
opinion
the
danger
*NL*
lies
not
in
that
fantastic
revolutionary
hydra
,
but
in
the
obstinacy
of
*NL*
traditionalism
clogging
progress
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
He
read
another
article
,
*NL*
too
,
a
financial
one
,
which
alluded
to
Bentham
and
Mill
,
and
dropped
*NL*
some
innuendoes
reflecting
on
the
ministry
.
With
his
characteristic
*NL*
quickwittedness
he
caught
the
drift
of
each
innuendo
,
divined
whence
it
*NL*
came
,
at
whom
and
on
what
ground
it
was
aimed
,
and
that
afforded
him
,
as
*NL*
it
always
did
,
a
certain
satisfaction
.
But
today
that
satisfaction
was
*NL*
embittered
by
Matrona
Philimonovna
's
advice
and
the
unsatisfactory
state
*NL*
of
the
household
.
He
read
,
too
,
that
Count
Beist
was
rumored
to
have
*NL*
left
for
Wiesbaden
,
and
that
one
need
have
no
more
gray
hair
,
and
of
the
*NL*
sale
of
a
light
carriage
,
and
of
a
young
person
seeking
a
situation
;
but
*NL*
these
items
of
information
did
not
give
him
,
as
usual
,
a
quiet
,
ironical
*NL*
gratification
.
Having
finished
the
paper
,
a
second
cup
of
coffee
and
a
*NL*
roll
and
butter
,
he
got
up
,
shaking
the
crumbs
of
the
roll
off
his
*NL*
waistcoat
;
and
,
squaring
his
broad
chest
,
he
smiled
joyously
:
not
*NL*
because
there
was
anything
particularly
agreeable
in
his
mind
--
the
*NL*
joyous
smile
was
evoked
by
a
good
digestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
joyous
smile
at
once
recalled
everything
to
him
,
and
he
grew
*NL*
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
childish
voices
-LRB-
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
recognized
the
voices
of
*NL*
Grisha
,
his
youngest
boy
,
and
Tanya
,
his
eldest
girl
-RRB-
were
heard
outside
*NL*
the
door
.
They
were
carrying
something
,
and
dropped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
not
to
sit
passengers
on
the
roof
,
''
said
the
little
girl
in
*NL*
English
;
``
there
,
pick
them
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
's
in
confusion
,
''
thought
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
;
``
there
are
the
*NL*
children
running
about
by
themselves
.
''
And
going
to
the
door
,
he
called
*NL*
them
.
They
threw
down
the
box
,
that
represented
a
train
,
and
came
in
to
*NL*
their
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
,
her
father
's
favorite
,
ran
up
boldly
,
embraced
him
,
and
*NL*
hung
laughingly
on
his
neck
,
enjoying
as
she
always
did
the
smell
of
*NL*
scent
that
came
from
his
whiskers
.
At
last
the
little
girl
kissed
his
*NL*
face
,
which
was
flushed
from
his
stooping
posture
and
beaming
with
*NL*
tenderness
,
loosed
her
hands
,
and
was
about
to
run
away
again
;
but
her
*NL*
father
held
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
mamma
?
''
he
asked
,
passing
his
hand
over
his
daughter
's
smooth
,
*NL*
soft
little
neck
.
``
Good
morning
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
to
the
boy
,
who
had
*NL*
come
up
to
greet
him
.
He
was
conscious
that
he
loved
the
boy
less
,
and
*NL*
always
tried
to
be
fair
;
but
the
boy
felt
it
,
and
did
not
respond
with
a
*NL*
smile
to
his
father
's
chilly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
?
She
is
up
,
''
answered
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sighed
.
``
That
means
that
she
's
not
slept
again
all
*NL*
night
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
is
she
cheerful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
knew
that
there
was
a
quarrel
between
her
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
and
that
her
mother
could
not
be
cheerful
,
and
that
her
father
*NL*
must
be
aware
of
this
,
and
that
he
was
pretending
when
he
asked
about
it
*NL*
so
lightly
.
And
she
blushed
for
her
father
.
He
at
once
perceived
it
,
and
*NL*
blushed
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
``
She
did
not
say
we
must
do
our
lessons
,
but
*NL*
she
said
we
were
to
go
for
a
walk
with
Miss
Hoole
to
grandmamma
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
,
Tanya
,
my
darling
.
Oh
,
wait
a
minute
,
though
,
''
he
said
,
still
*NL*
holding
her
and
stroking
her
soft
little
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
off
the
mantelpiece
,
where
he
had
put
it
yesterday
,
a
little
box
*NL*
of
sweets
,
and
gave
her
two
,
picking
out
her
favorites
,
a
chocolate
and
*NL*
a
fondant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Grisha
?
''
said
the
little
girl
,
pointing
to
the
chocolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
And
still
stroking
her
little
shoulder
,
he
kissed
her
on
the
*NL*
roots
of
her
hair
and
neck
,
and
let
her
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
carriage
is
ready
,
''
said
Matvey
;
``
but
there
's
some
one
to
see
you
*NL*
with
a
petition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
here
long
?
''
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
times
have
I
told
you
to
tell
me
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
let
you
drink
your
coffee
in
peace
,
at
least
,
''
said
Matvey
,
in
*NL*
the
affectionately
gruff
tone
with
which
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
show
the
person
up
at
once
,
''
said
Oblonsky
,
frowning
with
*NL*
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
petitioner
,
the
widow
of
a
staff
captain
Kalinin
,
came
with
a
*NL*
request
impossible
and
unreasonable
;
but
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
he
*NL*
generally
did
,
made
her
sit
down
,
heard
her
to
the
end
attentively
*NL*
without
interrupting
her
,
and
gave
her
detailed
advice
as
to
how
and
to
*NL*
whom
to
apply
,
and
even
wrote
her
,
in
his
large
,
sprawling
,
good
and
*NL*
legible
hand
,
a
confident
and
fluent
little
note
to
a
personage
who
*NL*
might
be
of
use
to
her
.
Having
got
rid
of
the
staff
captain
's
widow
,
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
his
hat
and
stopped
to
recollect
whether
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
anything
.
It
appeared
that
he
had
forgotten
nothing
except
*NL*
what
he
wanted
to
forget
--
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
He
bowed
his
head
,
and
his
handsome
face
assumed
a
harassed
*NL*
expression
.
``
To
go
,
or
not
to
go
!
''
he
said
to
himself
;
and
an
inner
*NL*
voice
told
him
he
must
not
go
,
that
nothing
could
come
of
it
but
*NL*
falsity
;
that
to
amend
,
to
set
right
their
relations
was
impossible
,
*NL*
because
it
was
impossible
to
make
her
attractive
again
and
able
to
*NL*
inspire
love
,
or
to
make
him
an
old
man
,
not
susceptible
to
love
.
Except
*NL*
deceit
and
lying
nothing
could
come
of
it
now
;
and
deceit
and
lying
were
*NL*
opposed
to
his
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
some
time
,
though
:
it
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
trying
to
give
himself
courage
.
He
squared
his
chest
,
took
out
a
*NL*
cigarette
,
took
two
whiffs
at
it
,
flung
it
into
a
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
ashtray
,
and
with
rapid
steps
walked
through
the
drawing
room
,
and
*NL*
opened
the
other
door
into
his
wife
's
bedroom

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
in
a
dressing
jacket
,
and
with
her
now
scanty
,
once
*NL*
luxuriant
and
beautiful
hair
fastened
up
with
hairpins
on
the
nape
of
*NL*
her
neck
,
with
a
sunken
,
thin
face
and
large
,
startled
eyes
,
which
*NL*
looked
prominent
from
the
thinness
of
her
face
,
was
standing
among
a
*NL*
litter
of
all
sorts
of
things
scattered
all
over
the
room
,
before
an
*NL*
open
bureau
,
from
which
she
was
taking
something
.
Hearing
her
husband
's
*NL*
steps
,
she
stopped
,
looking
towards
the
door
,
and
trying
assiduously
to
*NL*
give
her
features
a
severe
and
contemptuous
expression
.
She
felt
she
was
*NL*
afraid
of
him
,
and
afraid
of
the
coming
interview
.
She
was
just
*NL*
attempting
to
do
what
she
had
attempted
to
do
ten
times
already
in
these
*NL*
last
three
days
--
to
sort
out
the
children
's
things
and
her
own
,
so
as
to
*NL*
take
them
to
her
mother
's
--
and
again
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
do
*NL*
this
;
but
now
again
,
as
each
time
before
,
she
kept
saying
to
herself
,
*NL*
``
that
things
can
not
go
on
like
this
,
that
she
must
take
some
step
''
to
*NL*
punish
him
,
put
him
to
shame
,
avenge
on
him
some
little
part
at
least
of
*NL*
the
suffering
he
had
caused
her
.
She
still
continued
to
tell
herself
*NL*
that
she
should
leave
him
,
but
she
was
conscious
that
this
was
*NL*
impossible
;
it
was
impossible
because
she
could
not
get
out
of
the
habit
*NL*
of
regarding
him
as
her
husband
and
loving
him
.
Besides
this
,
she
*NL*
realized
that
if
even
here
in
her
own
house
she
could
hardly
manage
to
*NL*
look
after
her
five
children
properly
,
they
would
be
still
worse
off
*NL*
where
she
was
going
with
them
all
.
As
it
was
,
even
in
the
course
of
*NL*
these
three
days
,
the
youngest
was
unwell
from
being
given
unwholesome
*NL*
soup
,
and
the
others
had
almost
gone
without
their
dinner
the
day
*NL*
before
.
She
was
conscious
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
away
;
but
,
*NL*
cheating
herself
,
she
went
on
all
the
same
sorting
out
her
things
and
*NL*
pretending
she
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
her
husband
,
she
dropped
her
hands
into
the
drawer
of
the
bureau
*NL*
as
though
looking
for
something
,
and
only
looked
round
at
him
when
he
*NL*
had
come
quite
up
to
her
.
But
her
face
,
to
which
she
tried
to
give
a
*NL*
severe
and
resolute
expression
,
betrayed
bewilderment
and
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
!
''
he
said
in
a
subdued
and
timid
voice
.
He
bent
his
head
towards
*NL*
his
shoulder
and
tried
to
look
pitiful
and
humble
,
but
for
all
that
he
*NL*
was
radiant
with
freshness
and
health
.
In
a
rapid
glance
she
scanned
his
*NL*
figure
that
beamed
with
health
and
freshness
.
``
Yes
,
he
is
happy
and
*NL*
content
!
''
she
thought
;
``
while
I.
...
And
that
disgusting
good
nature
,
*NL*
which
every
one
likes
him
for
and
praises
--
I
hate
that
good
nature
of
*NL*
his
,
''
she
thought
.
Her
mouth
stiffened
,
the
muscles
of
the
cheek
*NL*
contracted
on
the
right
side
of
her
pale
,
nervous
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
said
in
a
rapid
,
deep
,
unnatural
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
!
''
he
repeated
,
with
a
quiver
in
his
voice
.
``
Anna
is
coming
*NL*
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
that
to
me
?
I
ca
n't
see
her
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
,
really
,
Dolly
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
go
away
,
go
away
!
''
she
shrieked
,
not
looking
at
him
,
as
though
*NL*
this
shriek
were
called
up
by
physical
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
could
be
calm
when
he
thought
of
his
wife
,
he
could
*NL*
hope
that
she
would
_
come
round
_
,
as
Matvey
expressed
it
,
and
could
*NL*
quietly
go
on
reading
his
paper
and
drinking
his
coffee
;
but
when
he
saw
*NL*
her
tortured
,
suffering
face
,
heard
the
tone
of
her
voice
,
submissive
to
*NL*
fate
and
full
of
despair
,
there
was
a
catch
in
his
breath
and
a
lump
in
*NL*
his
throat
,
and
his
eyes
began
to
shine
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
what
have
I
done
?
Dolly
!
For
God
's
sake
!
...
You
know
...
''
He
*NL*
could
not
go
on
;
there
was
a
sob
in
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shut
the
bureau
with
a
slam
,
and
glanced
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
what
can
I
say
?
...
One
thing
:
forgive
...
Remember
,
can
not
nine
*NL*
years
of
my
life
atone
for
an
instant
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
eyes
and
listened
,
expecting
what
he
would
say
,
as
it
*NL*
were
beseeching
him
in
some
way
or
other
to
make
her
believe
*NL*
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
instant
of
passion
?
''
he
said
,
and
would
have
gone
on
,
but
at
that
*NL*
word
,
as
at
a
pang
of
physical
pain
,
her
lips
stiffened
again
,
and
again
*NL*
the
muscles
of
her
right
cheek
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
go
out
of
the
room
!
''
she
shrieked
still
more
shrilly
,
``
and
*NL*
do
n't
talk
to
me
of
your
passion
and
your
loathsomeness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
go
out
,
but
tottered
,
and
clung
to
the
back
of
a
chair
to
*NL*
support
herself
.
His
face
relaxed
,
his
lips
swelled
,
his
eyes
were
*NL*
swimming
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
!
''
he
said
,
sobbing
now
;
``
for
mercy
's
sake
,
think
of
the
children
;
*NL*
they
are
not
to
blame
!
I
am
to
blame
,
and
punish
me
,
make
me
expiate
my
*NL*
fault
.
Anything
I
can
do
,
I
am
ready
to
do
anything
!
I
am
to
blame
,
no
*NL*
words
can
express
how
much
I
am
to
blame
!
But
,
Dolly
,
forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
.
He
listened
to
her
hard
,
heavy
breathing
,
and
he
was
*NL*
unutterably
sorry
for
her
.
She
tried
several
times
to
begin
to
speak
,
*NL*
but
could
not
.
He
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
the
children
,
Stiva
,
to
play
with
them
;
but
I
remember
*NL*
them
,
and
know
that
this
means
their
ruin
,
''
she
said
--
obviously
one
of
*NL*
the
phrases
she
had
more
than
once
repeated
to
herself
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
last
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
called
him
``
Stiva
,
''
and
he
glanced
at
her
with
gratitude
,
and
*NL*
moved
to
take
her
hand
,
but
she
drew
back
from
him
with
aversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
of
the
children
,
and
for
that
reason
I
would
do
anything
in
the
*NL*
world
to
save
them
,
but
I
do
n't
myself
know
how
to
save
them
.
By
taking
*NL*
them
away
from
their
father
,
or
by
leaving
them
with
a
vicious
*NL*
father
--
yes
,
a
vicious
father
...
Tell
me
,
after
what
...
has
happened
,
*NL*
can
we
live
together
?
Is
that
possible
?
Tell
me
,
eh
,
is
it
possible
?
''
*NL*
she
repeated
,
raising
her
voice
,
``
after
my
husband
,
the
father
of
my
*NL*
children
,
enters
into
a
love
affair
with
his
own
children
's
governess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
could
I
do
?
what
could
I
do
?
''
he
kept
saying
in
a
pitiful
*NL*
voice
,
not
knowing
what
he
was
saying
,
as
his
head
sank
lower
and
lower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
loathsome
to
me
,
repulsive
!
''
she
shrieked
,
getting
more
and
*NL*
more
heated
.
``
Your
tears
mean
nothing
!
You
have
never
loved
me
;
you
have
*NL*
neither
heart
nor
honorable
feeling
!
You
are
hateful
to
me
,
disgusting
,
*NL*
a
stranger
--
yes
,
a
complete
stranger
!
''
With
pain
and
wrath
she
uttered
*NL*
the
word
so
terrible
to
herself
--
_
stranger
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
,
and
the
fury
expressed
in
her
face
alarmed
and
amazed
*NL*
him
.
He
did
not
understand
how
his
pity
for
her
exasperated
her
.
She
saw
*NL*
in
him
sympathy
for
her
,
but
not
love
.
``
No
,
she
hates
me
.
She
will
not
*NL*
forgive
me
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
awful
!
awful
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
in
the
next
room
a
child
began
to
cry
;
probably
it
had
*NL*
fallen
down
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
listened
,
and
her
face
suddenly
*NL*
softened
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
pulling
herself
together
for
a
few
seconds
,
as
though
*NL*
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
,
and
what
she
was
doing
,
and
getting
up
*NL*
rapidly
,
she
moved
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
loves
my
child
,
''
he
thought
,
noticing
the
change
of
her
face
*NL*
at
the
child
's
cry
,
``
my
child
:
how
can
she
hate
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
one
word
more
,
''
he
said
,
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
come
near
me
,
I
will
call
in
the
servants
,
the
children

They
*NL*
may
all
know
you
are
a
scoundrel
!
I
am
going
away
at
once
,
and
you
may
*NL*
live
here
with
your
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
out
,
slamming
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sighed
,
wiped
his
face
,
and
with
a
subdued
tread
*NL*
walked
out
of
the
room
.
``
Matvey
says
she
will
come
round
;
but
how
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
the
least
chance
of
it
.
Ah
,
oh
,
how
horrible
it
is
!
And
how
*NL*
vulgarly
she
shouted
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
remembering
her
shriek
and
*NL*
the
words
--
``
scoundrel
''
and
``
mistress
.
''
``
And
very
likely
the
maids
were
*NL*
listening
!
Horribly
vulgar
!
horrible
!
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
stood
a
few
*NL*
seconds
alone
,
wiped
his
face
,
squared
his
chest
,
and
walked
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Friday
,
and
in
the
dining
room
the
German
watchmaker
was
winding
*NL*
up
the
clock
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
remembered
his
joke
about
this
*NL*
punctual
,
bald
watchmaker
,
``
that
the
German
was
wound
up
for
a
whole
*NL*
lifetime
himself
,
to
wind
up
watches
,
''
and
he
smiled
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
fond
of
a
joke
:
``
And
maybe
she
will
come
round
!
That
's
*NL*
a
good
expression
,
'
_
come
round
,
_
'
''
he
thought
.
``
I
must
repeat
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matvey
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
Arrange
everything
with
Darya
in
the
sitting
room
*NL*
for
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
he
said
to
Matvey
when
he
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
put
on
his
fur
coat
and
went
out
onto
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
dine
at
home
?
''
said
Matvey
,
seeing
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
it
happens
.
But
here
's
for
the
housekeeping
,
''
he
said
,
taking
*NL*
ten
roubles
from
his
pocketbook
.
``
That
'll
be
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
or
not
enough
,
we
must
make
it
do
,
''
said
Matvey
,
slamming
the
*NL*
carriage
door
and
stepping
back
onto
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
meanwhile
having
pacified
the
child
,
and
knowing
from
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
carriage
that
he
had
gone
off
,
went
back
again
to
her
*NL*
bedroom
.
It
was
her
solitary
refuge
from
the
household
cares
which
*NL*
crowded
upon
her
directly
she
went
out
from
it
.
Even
now
,
in
the
short
*NL*
time
she
had
been
in
the
nursery
,
the
English
governess
and
Matrona
*NL*
Philimonovna
had
succeeded
in
putting
several
questions
to
her
,
which
*NL*
did
not
admit
of
delay
,
and
which
only
she
could
answer
:
``
What
were
the
*NL*
children
to
put
on
for
their
walk
?
Should
they
have
any
milk
?
Should
not
*NL*
a
new
cook
be
sent
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
let
me
alone
,
let
me
alone
!
''
she
said
,
and
going
back
to
her
*NL*
bedroom
she
sat
down
in
the
same
place
as
she
had
sat
when
talking
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
clasping
tightly
her
thin
hands
with
the
rings
that
slipped
*NL*
down
on
her
bony
fingers
,
and
fell
to
going
over
in
her
memory
all
the
*NL*
conversation
.
``
He
has
gone
!
But
has
he
broken
it
off
with
her
?
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
``
Can
it
be
he
sees
her
?
Why
did
n't
I
ask
him
!
No

no

is
impossible
.
Even
if
we
remain
in
the
same
house
,
we
*NL*
are
strangers
--
strangers
forever
!
''
She
repeated
again
with
special
*NL*
significance
the
word
so
dreadful
to
her
.
``
And
how
I
loved
him
!
my
God
,
*NL*
how
I
loved
him
!
...
How
I
loved
him
!
And
now
do
n't
I
love
him
?
Do
n't
I
*NL*
love
him
more
than
before
?
The
most
horrible
thing
is
,
''
she
began
,
but
*NL*
did
not
finish
her
thought
,
because
Matrona
Philimonovna
put
her
head
in
*NL*
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
send
for
my
brother
,
''
she
said
;
``
he
can
get
a
dinner
anyway
,
or
*NL*
we
shall
have
the
children
getting
nothing
to
eat
till
six
again
,
like
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
will
come
directly
and
see
about
it
.
But
did
you
send
for
*NL*
some
new
milk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Darya
Alexandrovna
plunged
into
the
duties
of
the
day
,
and
drowned
*NL*
her
grief
in
them
for
a
time
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
learned
easily
at
school
,
thanks
to
his
*NL*
excellent
abilities
,
but
he
had
been
idle
and
mischievous
,
and
therefore
*NL*
was
one
of
the
lowest
in
his
class
.
But
in
spite
of
his
habitually
*NL*
dissipated
mode
of
life
,
his
inferior
grade
in
the
service
,
and
his
*NL*
comparative
youth
,
he
occupied
the
honorable
and
lucrative
position
of
*NL*
president
of
one
of
the
government
boards
at
Moscow
.
This
post
he
had
*NL*
received
through
his
sister
Anna
's
husband
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
Karenin
,
who
held
one
of
the
most
important
positions
in
the
ministry
to
*NL*
whose
department
the
Moscow
office
belonged
.
But
if
Karenin
had
not
got
*NL*
his
brother-in-law
this
berth
,
then
through
a
hundred
other
*NL*
personages
--
brothers
,
sisters
,
cousins
,
uncles
,
and
aunts
--
Stiva
*NL*
Oblonsky
would
have
received
this
post
,
or
some
other
similar
one
,
*NL*
together
with
the
salary
of
six
thousand
absolutely
needful
for
him
,
as
*NL*
his
affairs
,
in
spite
of
his
wife
's
considerable
property
,
were
in
an
*NL*
embarrassed
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
Moscow
and
Petersburg
were
friends
and
relations
of
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
He
was
born
in
the
midst
of
those
who
had
been
and
are
the
*NL*
powerful
ones
of
this
world
.
One-third
of
the
men
in
the
government
,
the
*NL*
older
men
,
had
been
friends
of
his
father
's
,
and
had
known
him
in
*NL*
petticoats
;
another
third
were
his
intimate
chums
,
and
the
remainder
*NL*
were
friendly
acquaintances
.
Consequently
the
distributors
of
earthly
*NL*
blessings
in
the
shape
of
places
,
rents
,
shares
,
and
such
,
were
all
his
*NL*
friends
,
and
could
not
overlook
one
of
their
own
set
;
and
Oblonsky
had
*NL*
no
need
to
make
any
special
exertion
to
get
a
lucrative
post
.
He
had
*NL*
only
not
to
refuse
things
,
not
to
show
jealousy
,
not
to
be
quarrelsome
*NL*
or
take
offense
,
all
of
which
from
his
characteristic
good
nature
he
*NL*
never
did
.
It
would
have
struck
him
as
absurd
if
he
had
been
told
that
*NL*
he
would
not
get
a
position
with
the
salary
he
required
,
especially
as
*NL*
he
expected
nothing
out
of
the
way
;
he
only
wanted
what
the
men
of
his
*NL*
own
age
and
standing
did
get
,
and
he
was
no
worse
qualified
for
*NL*
performing
duties
of
the
kind
than
any
other
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
not
merely
liked
by
all
who
knew
him
for
his
*NL*
good
humor
,
but
for
his
bright
disposition
,
and
his
unquestionable
*NL*
honesty
.
In
him
,
in
his
handsome
,
radiant
figure
,
his
sparkling
eyes
,
*NL*
black
hair
and
eyebrows
,
and
the
white
and
red
of
his
face
,
there
was
*NL*
something
which
produced
a
physical
effect
of
kindliness
and
good
humor
*NL*
on
the
people
who
met
him
.
``
Aha
!
Stiva
!
Oblonsky
!
Here
he
is
!
''
was
*NL*
almost
always
said
with
a
smile
of
delight
on
meeting
him
.
Even
though
*NL*
it
happened
at
times
that
after
a
conversation
with
him
it
seemed
that
*NL*
nothing
particularly
delightful
had
happened
,
the
next
day
,
and
the
*NL*
next
,
every
one
was
just
as
delighted
at
meeting
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
filling
for
three
years
the
post
of
president
of
one
of
the
*NL*
government
boards
at
Moscow
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
won
the
respect
,
as
*NL*
well
as
the
liking
,
of
his
fellow-officials
,
subordinates
,
and
*NL*
superiors
,
and
all
who
had
had
business
with
him
.
The
principal
*NL*
qualities
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
which
had
gained
him
this
universal
*NL*
respect
in
the
service
consisted
,
in
the
first
place
,
of
his
extreme
*NL*
indulgence
for
others
,
founded
on
a
consciousness
of
his
own
*NL*
shortcomings
;
secondly
,
of
his
perfect
liberalism
--
not
the
liberalism
he
*NL*
read
of
in
the
papers
,
but
the
liberalism
that
was
in
his
blood
,
in
*NL*
virtue
of
which
he
treated
all
men
perfectly
equally
and
exactly
the
*NL*
same
,
whatever
their
fortune
or
calling
might
be
;
and
thirdly
--
the
most
*NL*
important
point
--
his
complete
indifference
to
the
business
in
which
he
*NL*
was
engaged
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
never
carried
away
,
and
*NL*
never
made
mistakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
offices
of
the
board
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
escorted
by
a
*NL*
deferential
porter
with
a
portfolio
,
went
into
his
little
private
room
,
*NL*
put
on
his
uniform
,
and
went
into
the
boardroom
.
The
clerks
and
copyists
*NL*
all
rose
,
greeting
him
with
good-humored
deference
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
moved
quickly
,
as
ever
,
to
his
place
,
shook
hands
with
his
colleagues
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
.
He
made
a
joke
or
two
,
and
talked
just
as
much
as
was
*NL*
consistent
with
due
decorum
,
and
began
work
.
No
one
knew
better
than
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
how
to
hit
on
the
exact
line
between
freedom
,
*NL*
simplicity
,
and
official
stiffness
necessary
for
the
agreeable
conduct
*NL*
of
business
.
A
secretary
,
with
the
good-humored
deference
common
to
*NL*
every
one
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
office
,
came
up
with
papers
,
and
*NL*
began
to
speak
in
the
familiar
and
easy
tone
which
had
been
introduced
*NL*
by
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
succeeded
in
getting
the
information
from
the
government
*NL*
department
of
Penza
.
Here
,
would
you
care
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
them
at
last
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
laying
his
finger
*NL*
on
the
paper
.
``
Now
,
gentlemen
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
sitting
of
the
board
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
knew
,
''
he
thought
,
bending
his
head
with
a
significant
air
as
*NL*
he
listened
to
the
report
,
``
what
a
guilty
little
boy
their
president
was
*NL*
half
an
hour
ago
.
''
And
his
eyes
were
laughing
during
the
reading
of
the
*NL*
report
.
Till
two
o'clock
the
sitting
would
go
on
without
a
break
,
and
at
*NL*
two
o'clock
there
would
be
an
interval
and
luncheon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
yet
two
,
when
the
large
glass
doors
of
the
boardroom
suddenly
*NL*
opened
and
someone
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
officials
sitting
on
the
further
side
under
the
portrait
of
the
*NL*
Tsar
and
the
eagle
,
delighted
at
any
distraction
,
looked
round
at
the
*NL*
door
;
but
the
doorkeeper
standing
at
the
door
at
once
drove
out
the
*NL*
intruder
,
and
closed
the
glass
door
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
case
had
been
read
through
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
got
up
and
*NL*
stretched
,
and
by
way
of
tribute
to
the
liberalism
of
the
times
took
out
*NL*
a
cigarette
in
the
boardroom
and
went
into
his
private
room
.
Two
of
the
*NL*
members
of
the
board
,
the
old
veteran
in
the
service
,
Nikitin
,
and
the
*NL*
_
Kammerjunker
Grinevitch
_
,
went
in
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
time
to
finish
after
lunch
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
we
shall
!
''
said
Nikitin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
sharp
fellow
this
Fomin
must
be
,
''
said
Grinevitch
of
one
of
*NL*
the
persons
taking
part
in
the
case
they
were
examining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
frowned
at
Grinevitch
's
words
,
giving
him
thereby
to
*NL*
understand
that
it
was
improper
to
pass
judgment
prematurely
,
and
made
*NL*
him
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
came
in
?
''
he
asked
the
doorkeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Someone
,
your
excellency
,
crept
in
without
permission
directly
my
back
*NL*
was
turned
.
He
was
asking
for
you
.
I
told
him
:
when
the
members
come
*NL*
out
,
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
he
's
gone
into
the
passage
,
but
here
he
comes
anyway
.
That
is
*NL*
he
,
''
said
the
doorkeeper
,
pointing
to
a
strongly
built
,
broad-shouldered
*NL*
man
with
a
curly
beard
,
who
,
without
taking
off
his
sheepskin
cap
,
was
*NL*
running
lightly
and
rapidly
up
the
worn
steps
of
the
stone
staircase
.
*NL*
One
of
the
members
going
down
--
a
lean
official
with
a
portfolio
--
stood
*NL*
out
of
his
way
and
looked
disapprovingly
at
the
legs
of
the
stranger
,
*NL*
then
glanced
inquiringly
at
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
.
His
*NL*
good-naturedly
beaming
face
above
the
embroidered
collar
of
his
uniform
*NL*
beamed
more
than
ever
when
he
recognized
the
man
coming
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
actually
you
,
Levin
,
at
last
!
''
he
said
with
a
friendly
*NL*
mocking
smile
,
scanning
Levin
as
he
approached
.
``
How
is
it
you
have
*NL*
deigned
to
look
me
up
in
this
den
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
not
*NL*
content
with
shaking
hands
,
he
kissed
his
friend
.
``
Have
you
been
here
*NL*
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
come
,
and
very
much
wanted
to
see
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
looking
*NL*
shyly
and
at
the
same
time
angrily
and
uneasily
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
go
into
my
room
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
knew
his
*NL*
friend
's
sensitive
and
irritable
shyness
,
and
,
taking
his
arm
,
he
drew
*NL*
him
along
,
as
though
guiding
him
through
dangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
on
familiar
terms
with
almost
all
his
*NL*
acquaintances
,
and
called
almost
all
of
them
by
their
Christian
names
:
*NL*
old
men
of
sixty
,
boys
of
twenty
,
actors
,
ministers
,
merchants
,
and
*NL*
adjutant-generals
,
so
that
many
of
his
intimate
chums
were
to
be
found
*NL*
at
the
extreme
ends
of
the
social
ladder
,
and
would
have
been
very
much
*NL*
surprised
to
learn
that
they
had
,
through
the
medium
of
Oblonsky
,
*NL*
something
in
common
.
He
was
the
familiar
friend
of
everyone
with
whom
he
*NL*
took
a
glass
of
champagne
,
and
he
took
a
glass
of
champagne
with
*NL*
everyone
,
and
when
in
consequence
he
met
any
of
his
disreputable
chums
,
*NL*
as
he
used
in
joke
to
call
many
of
his
friends
,
in
the
presence
of
his
*NL*
subordinates
,
he
well
knew
how
,
with
his
characteristic
tact
,
to
*NL*
diminish
the
disagreeable
impression
made
on
them
.
Levin
was
not
a
*NL*
disreputable
chum
,
but
Oblonsky
,
with
his
ready
tact
,
felt
that
Levin
*NL*
fancied
he
might
not
care
to
show
his
intimacy
with
him
before
his
*NL*
subordinates
,
and
so
he
made
haste
to
take
him
off
into
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
almost
of
the
same
age
as
Oblonsky
;
their
intimacy
did
not
*NL*
rest
merely
on
champagne
.
Levin
had
been
the
friend
and
companion
of
his
*NL*
early
youth
.
They
were
fond
of
one
another
in
spite
of
the
difference
of
*NL*
their
characters
and
tastes
,
as
friends
are
fond
of
one
another
who
have
*NL*
been
together
in
early
youth
.
But
in
spite
of
this
,
each
of
them
--
as
is
*NL*
often
the
way
with
men
who
have
selected
careers
of
different
*NL*
kinds
--
though
in
discussion
he
would
even
justify
the
other
's
career
,
in
*NL*
his
heart
despised
it
.
It
seemed
to
each
of
them
that
the
life
he
led
*NL*
himself
was
the
only
real
life
,
and
the
life
led
by
his
friend
was
a
*NL*
mere
phantasm
.
Oblonsky
could
not
restrain
a
slight
mocking
smile
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
Levin
.
How
often
he
had
seen
him
come
up
to
Moscow
from
the
*NL*
country
where
he
was
doing
something
,
but
what
precisely
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
could
never
quite
make
out
,
and
indeed
he
took
no
interest
*NL*
in
the
matter
.
Levin
arrived
in
Moscow
always
excited
and
in
a
hurry
,
*NL*
rather
ill
at
ease
and
irritated
by
his
own
want
of
ease
,
and
for
the
*NL*
most
part
with
a
perfectly
new
,
unexpected
view
of
things
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
laughed
at
this
,
and
liked
it
.
In
the
same
way
Levin
in
his
*NL*
heart
despised
the
town
mode
of
life
of
his
friend
,
and
his
official
*NL*
duties
,
which
he
laughed
at
,
and
regarded
as
trifling
.
But
the
*NL*
difference
was
that
Oblonsky
,
as
he
was
doing
the
same
as
every
one
did
,
*NL*
laughed
complacently
and
good-humoredly
,
while
Levin
laughed
without
*NL*
complacency
and
sometimes
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
long
been
expecting
you
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
going
into
*NL*
his
room
and
letting
Levin
's
hand
go
as
though
to
show
that
here
all
*NL*
danger
was
over
.
``
I
am
very
,
very
glad
to
see
you
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
how
are
you
?
Eh
?
When
did
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
silent
,
looking
at
the
unknown
faces
of
Oblonsky
's
two
*NL*
companions
,
and
especially
at
the
hand
of
the
elegant
Grinevitch
,
which
*NL*
had
such
long
white
fingers
,
such
long
yellow
filbert-shaped
nails
,
and
*NL*
such
huge
shining
studs
on
the
shirt-cuff
,
that
apparently
they
absorbed
*NL*
all
his
attention
,
and
allowed
him
no
freedom
of
thought
.
Oblonsky
*NL*
noticed
this
at
once
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
let
me
introduce
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
My
colleagues
:
Philip
*NL*
Ivanitch
Nikitin
,
Mihail
Stanislavitch
Grinevitch
''
--
and
turning
to
*NL*
Levin
--
``
a
district
councilor
,
a
modern
district
councilman
,
a
gymnast
*NL*
who
lifts
thirteen
stone
with
one
hand
,
a
cattle-breeder
and
sportsman
,
*NL*
and
my
friend
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
Levin
,
the
brother
of
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
Koznishev
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
,
''
said
the
veteran
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
honor
of
knowing
your
brother
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
''
said
*NL*
Grinevitch
,
holding
out
his
slender
hand
with
its
long
nails
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
frowned
,
shook
hands
coldly
,
and
at
once
turned
to
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
Though
he
had
a
great
respect
for
his
half-brother
,
an
author
well
known
*NL*
to
all
Russia
,
he
could
not
endure
it
when
people
treated
him
not
as
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
,
but
as
the
brother
of
the
celebrated
Koznishev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
no
longer
a
district
councilor
.
I
have
quarreled
with
them
*NL*
all
,
and
do
n't
go
to
the
meetings
any
more
,
''
he
said
,
turning
to
*NL*
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
quick
about
it
!
''
said
Oblonsky
with
a
smile
.
``
But
how
?
*NL*
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
story
.
I
will
tell
you
some
time
,
''
said
Levin
,
but
he
began
*NL*
telling
him
at
once
.
``
Well
,
to
put
it
shortly
,
I
was
convinced
that
*NL*
nothing
was
really
done
by
the
district
councils
,
or
ever
could
be
,
''
he
*NL*
began
,
as
though
some
one
had
just
insulted
him
.
``
On
one
side
it
's
a
*NL*
plaything
;
they
play
at
being
a
parliament
,
and
I
'm
neither
young
enough
*NL*
nor
old
enough
to
find
amusement
in
playthings
;
and
on
the
other
side
''
*NL*
-LRB-
he
stammered
-RRB-
``
it
's
a
means
for
the
coterie
of
the
district
to
make
*NL*
money
.
Formerly
they
had
wardships
,
courts
of
justice
,
now
they
have
the
*NL*
district
council
--
not
in
the
form
of
bribes
,
but
in
the
form
of
unearned
*NL*
salary
,
''
he
said
,
as
hotly
as
though
someone
of
those
present
had
*NL*
opposed
his
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha
!
You
're
in
a
new
phase
again
,
I
see
--
a
conservative
,

said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
``
However
,
we
can
go
into
that
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
later
.
But
I
wanted
to
see
you

''
said
Levin
,
looking
with
hatred
*NL*
at
Grinevitch
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
gave
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
you
used
to
say
you
would
never
wear
European
dress
again
?
''
*NL*
he
said
,
scanning
his
new
suit
,
obviously
cut
by
a
French
tailor
.
``
Ah
!
I
*NL*
see
:
a
new
phase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
suddenly
blushed
,
not
as
grown
men
blush
,
slightly
,
without
being
*NL*
themselves
aware
of
it
,
but
as
boys
blush
,
feeling
that
they
are
*NL*
ridiculous
through
their
shyness
,
and
consequently
ashamed
of
it
and
*NL*
blushing
still
more
,
almost
to
the
point
of
tears
.
And
it
was
so
strange
*NL*
to
see
this
sensible
,
manly
face
in
such
a
childish
plight
,
that
*NL*
Oblonsky
left
off
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
where
shall
we
meet
?
You
know
I
want
very
much
to
talk
to
you
,
''
*NL*
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oblonsky
seemed
to
ponder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
:
let
's
go
to
Gurin
's
to
lunch
,
and
there
we
can
*NL*
talk
.
I
am
free
till
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Levin
,
after
an
instant
's
thought
,
``
I
have
got
to
go
on
*NL*
somewhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
let
's
dine
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dine
together
?
But
I
have
nothing
very
particular
,
only
a
few
words
to
*NL*
say
,
and
a
question
I
want
to
ask
you
,
and
we
can
have
a
talk
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
say
the
few
words
,
then
,
at
once
,
and
we
'll
gossip
after
dinner

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
this
,
''
said
Levin
;
``
but
it
's
of
no
importance
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
all
at
once
took
an
expression
of
anger
from
the
effort
he
was
*NL*
making
to
surmount
his
shyness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
the
Shtcherbatskys
doing
?
Everything
as
it
used
to
be
?

he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
had
long
known
that
Levin
was
in
love
with
his
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
Kitty
,
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
smile
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
a
few
words
,
but
I
ca
n't
answer
in
a

words

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
secretary
came
in
,
with
respectful
familiarity
and
the
modest
*NL*
consciousness
,
characteristic
of
every
secretary
,
of
superiority
to
his
*NL*
chief
in
the
knowledge
of
their
business
;
he
went
up
to
Oblonsky
with
*NL*
some
papers
,
and
began
,
under
pretense
of
asking
a
question
,
to
explain
*NL*
some
objection
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
without
hearing
him
out
,
laid
his
*NL*
hand
genially
on
the
secretary
's
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
do
as
I
told
you
,
''
he
said
,
softening
his
words
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
and
with
a
brief
explanation
of
his
view
of
the
matter
he
turned
away
*NL*
from
the
papers
,
and
said
:
``
So
do
it
that
way
,
if
you
please

Nikititch

*NL*
*NL*
The
secretary
retired
in
confusion
.
During
the
consultation
with
the
*NL*
secretary
Levin
had
completely
recovered
from
his
embarrassment
.
He
was
*NL*
standing
with
his
elbows
on
the
back
of
a
chair
,
and
on
his
face
was
a
*NL*
look
of
ironical
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
I
do
n't
understand
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
n't
you
understand
?
''
said
Oblonsky
,
smiling
as
brightly
as
ever
,
*NL*
and
picking
up
a
cigarette
.
He
expected
some
queer
outburst
from
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
are
doing
,
''
said
Levin
,
shrugging
his
*NL*
shoulders
.
``
How
can
you
do
it
seriously
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

because
there
's
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

But

there

you

added
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
to
say
,
you
think
there
's
a
lack
of
something
in
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
But
all
the

I
admire
your
grandeur

am
proud

a

a
great
person

You
've
not

question

he
went
on
,
with
a
desperate
effort
looking
*NL*
Oblonsky
straight
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

that
's
all
very
well

You
wait
a
bit

and
you
'll
come
to
this

yourself

It
's
very
nice
for
you
to
have
over
six
thousand
acres
in
the
*NL*
Karazinsky
district
,
and
such
muscles
,
and
the
freshness
of
a
girl
of
*NL*
twelve
;
still
you
'll
be
one
of
us
one
day

Yes
,
as
to
your
question
,
*NL*
there
is
no
change
,
but
it
's
a
pity
you
've
been
away
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
so
?
''
Levin
queried
,
panic-stricken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
responded
Oblonsky
.
``
We
'll
talk
it
over

But
what
's
*NL*
brought
you
up
to
town
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
'll
talk
about
that

too

later
on

said
Levin
,
reddening
again
*NL*
up
to
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

I
see

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
I
should
ask
you

But
I
tell
you
what

*NL*
if
you
want

they
're
sure
now

be

You
drive
along

dine
somewhere

*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
called
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

truly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
went
out
of
the
room
,
only
when
he
was
in
the
doorway
*NL*
remembering
that
he
had
forgotten
to
take
leave
of
Oblonsky
's
*NL*
colleagues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
gentleman
must
be

said
Grinevitch
,
when
*NL*
Levin
had
gone
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
nodding
his
head
,
``

``

When
Oblonsky
asked
Levin
what
had
brought
him
to
town
,
Levin
blushed
,
*NL*
and
was
furious
with
himself
for
blushing
,
because
he
could
not
answer
,
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
make
your
sister-in-law
an
offer
,
''
though
that
was
*NL*
precisely
what
he
had
come
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
families
of
the
Levins
and
the
Shtcherbatskys
were
old
,
noble
Moscow
*NL*
families
,
and
had
always
been
on
intimate
and
friendly
terms
.
This
*NL*
intimacy
had
grown
still
closer
during
Levin
's
student
days
.
He
had
both
*NL*
prepared
for
the
university
with
the
young
Prince
Shtcherbatsky
,
the
*NL*
brother
of
Kitty
and
Dolly
,
and
had
entered
at
the
same
time
with
him
.
*NL*
In
those
days
Levin
used
often
to
be
in
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
,
and
*NL*
he
was
in
love
with
the
Shtcherbatsky
household
.
Strange
as
it
may
*NL*
appear
,
it
was
with
the
household
,
the
family
,
that
Konstantin
Levin
was
*NL*
in
love
,
especially
with
the
feminine
half
of
the
household
.
Levin
did
*NL*
not
remember
his
own
mother
,
and
his
only
sister
was
older
than
he
was
,
*NL*
so
that
it
was
in
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
that
he
saw
for
the
first
*NL*
time
that
inner
life
of
an
old
,
noble
,
cultivated
,
and
honorable
family
*NL*
of
which
he
had
been
deprived
by
the
death
of
his
father
and
mother
.
All
*NL*
the
members
of
that
family
,
especially
the
feminine
half
,
were
pictured
*NL*
by
him
,
as
it
were
,
wrapped
about
with
a
mysterious
poetical
veil
,
and
*NL*
he
not
only
perceived
no
defects
whatever
in
them
,
but
under
the
*NL*
poetical
veil
that
shrouded
them
he
assumed
the
existence
of
the
*NL*
loftiest
sentiments
and
every
possible
perfection
.
Why
it
was
the
three
*NL*
young
ladies
had
one
day
to
speak
French
,
and
the
next
English
;
why
it
*NL*
was
that
at
certain
hours
they
played
by
turns
on
the
piano
,
the
sounds
*NL*
of
which
were
audible
in
their
brother
's
room
above
,
where
the
students
*NL*
used
to
work
;
why
they
were
visited
by
those
professors
of
French
*NL*
literature
,
of
music
,
of
drawing
,
of
dancing
;
why
at
certain
hours
all
*NL*
the
three
young
ladies
,
with
Mademoiselle
Linon
,
drove
in
the
coach
to
*NL*
the
Tversky
boulevard
,
dressed
in
their
satin
cloaks
,
Dolly
in
a
long
*NL*
one
,
Natalia
in
a
half-long
one
,
and
Kitty
in
one
so
short
that
her
*NL*
shapely
legs
in
tightly-drawn
red
stockings
were
visible
to
all
*NL*
beholders
;
why
it
was
they
had
to
walk
about
the
Tversky
boulevard
*NL*
escorted
by
a
footman
with
a
gold
cockade
in
his
hat
--
all
this
and
much
*NL*
more
that
was
done
in
their
mysterious
world
he
did
not
understand
,
but
*NL*
he
was
sure
that
everything
that
was
done
there
was
very
good
,
and
he
*NL*
was
in
love
precisely
with
the
mystery
of
the
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
student
days
he
had
all
but
been
in
love
with
the
eldest
,
Dolly
,
*NL*
but
she
was
soon
married
to
Oblonsky
.
Then
he
began
being
in
love
with
*NL*
the
second
.
He
felt
,
as
it
were
,
that
he
had
to
be
in
love
with
one
of
*NL*
the
sisters
,
only
he
could
not
quite
make
out
which
.
But
Natalia
,
too
,
*NL*
had
hardly
made
her
appearance
in
the
world
when
she
married
the
*NL*
diplomat
Lvov
.
Kitty
was
still
a
child
when
Levin
left
the
university
.
*NL*
Young
Shtcherbatsky
went
into
the
navy
,
was
drowned
in
the
Baltic
,
and
*NL*
Levin
's
relations
with
the
Shtcherbatskys
,
in
spite
of
his
friendship
*NL*
with
Oblonsky
,
became
less
intimate
.
But
when
early
in
the
winter
of
*NL*
this
year
Levin
came
to
Moscow
,
after
a
year
in
the
country
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
,
he
realized
which
of
the
three
sisters
he
was
indeed
*NL*
destined
to
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
thought
that
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
for
him
,
a
man
*NL*
of
good
family
,
rather
rich
than
poor
,
and
thirty-two
years
old
,
to
make
*NL*
the
young
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
an
offer
of
marriage
;
in
all
*NL*
likelihood
he
would
at
once
have
been
looked
upon
as
a
good
match
.
But
*NL*
Levin
was
in
love
,
and
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
Kitty
was
so
perfect
in
*NL*
every
respect
that
she
was
a
creature
far
above
everything
earthly
;
and
*NL*
that
he
was
a
creature
so
low
and
so
earthly
that
it
could
not
even
be
*NL*
conceived
that
other
people
and
she
herself
could
regard
him
as
worthy
*NL*
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
spending
two
months
in
Moscow
in
a
state
of
enchantment
,
seeing
*NL*
Kitty
almost
every
day
in
society
,
into
which
he
went
so
as
to
meet
her
,
*NL*
he
abruptly
decided
that
it
could
not
be
,
and
went
back
to
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
's
conviction
that
it
could
not
be
was
founded
on
the
idea
that
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
her
family
he
was
a
disadvantageous
and
worthless
match
for
*NL*
the
charming
Kitty
,
and
that
Kitty
herself
could
not
love
him
.
In
her
*NL*
family
's
eyes
he
had
no
ordinary
,
definite
career
and
position
in
*NL*
society
,
while
his
contemporaries
by
this
time
,
when
he
was
thirty-two
,
*NL*
were
already
,
one
a
colonel
,
and
another
a
professor
,
another
director
*NL*
of
a
bank
and
railways
,
or
president
of
a
board
like
Oblonsky
.
But
he
*NL*
-LRB-
he
knew
very
well
how
he
must
appear
to
others
-RRB-
was
a
country
*NL*
gentleman
,
occupied
in
breeding
cattle
,
shooting
game
,
and
building
*NL*
barns
;
in
other
words
,
a
fellow
of
no
ability
,
who
had
not
turned
out
*NL*
well
,
and
who
was
doing
just
what
,
according
to
the
ideas
of
the
world
,
*NL*
is
done
by
people
fit
for
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mysterious
,
enchanting
Kitty
herself
could
not
love
such
an
ugly
*NL*
person
as
he
conceived
himself
to
be
,
and
,
above
all
,
such
an
ordinary
,
*NL*
in
no
way
striking
person
.
Moreover
,
his
attitude
to
Kitty
in
the
*NL*
past
--
the
attitude
of
a
grown-up
person
to
a
child
,
arising
from
his
*NL*
friendship
with
her
brother
--
seemed
to
him
yet
another
obstacle
to
love
.
*NL*
An
ugly
,
good-natured
man
,
as
he
considered
himself
,
might
,
he
supposed
,
*NL*
be
liked
as
a
friend
;
but
to
be
loved
with
such
a
love
as
that
with
*NL*
which
he
loved
Kitty
,
one
would
need
to
be
a
handsome
and
,
still
more
,
a
*NL*
distinguished
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
that
women
often
did
care
for
ugly
and
ordinary
men
,
but
he
*NL*
did
not
believe
it
,
for
he
judged
by
himself
,
and
he
could
not
himself
*NL*
have
loved
any
but
beautiful
,
mysterious
,
and
exceptional
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
spending
two
months
alone
in
the
country
,
he
was
convinced
*NL*
that
this
was
not
one
of
those
passions
of
which
he
had
had
experience
*NL*
in
his
early
youth
;
that
this
feeling
gave
him
not
an
instant
's
rest
;
*NL*
that
he
could
not
live
without
deciding
the
question
,
would
she
or
would
*NL*
she
not
be
his
wife
,
and
that
his
despair
had
arisen
only
from
his
own
*NL*
imaginings
,
that
he
had
no
sort
of
proof
that
he
would
be
rejected
.
And
*NL*
he
had
now
come
to
Moscow
with
a
firm
determination
to
make
an
offer
,
*NL*
and
get
married
if
he
were
accepted
.
Or
...
he
could
not
conceive
what
*NL*
would
become
of
him
if
he
were
rejected
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
in
Moscow
by
a
morning
train
,
Levin
had
put
up
at
the
house
*NL*
of
his
elder
half-brother
,
Koznishev
.
After
changing
his
clothes
he
went
*NL*
down
to
his
brother
's
study
,
intending
to
talk
to
him
at
once
about
the
*NL*
object
of
his
visit
,
and
to
ask
his
advice
;
but
his
brother
was
not
*NL*
alone
.
With
him
there
was
a
well-known
professor
of
philosophy
,
who
had
*NL*
come
from
Harkov
expressly
to
clear
up
a
difference
that
had
arisen
*NL*
between
them
on
a
very
important
philosophical
question
.
The
professor
*NL*
was
carrying
on
a
hot
crusade
against
materialists
.
Sergey
Koznishev
had
*NL*
been
following
this
crusade
with
interest
,
and
after
reading
the
*NL*
professor
's
last
article
,
he
had
written
him
a
letter
stating
his
*NL*
objections
.
He
accused
the
professor
of
making
too
great
concessions
to
*NL*
the
materialists
.
And
the
professor
had
promptly
appeared
to
argue
the
*NL*
matter
out
.
The
point
in
discussion
was
the
question
then
in
vogue
:
Is
*NL*
there
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
psychological
and
physiological
*NL*
phenomena
in
man
?
and
if
so
,
where
?
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
met
his
brother
with
the
smile
of
chilly
friendliness
*NL*
he
always
had
for
everyone
,
and
introducing
him
to
the
professor
,
went
*NL*
on
with
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
man
in
spectacles
,
with
a
narrow
forehead
,
tore
himself
from
*NL*
the
discussion
for
an
instant
to
greet
Levin
,
and
then
went
on
talking
*NL*
without
paying
any
further
attention
to
him
.
Levin
sat
down
to
wait
till
*NL*
the
professor
should
go
,
but
he
soon
began
to
get
interested
in
the
*NL*
subject
under
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
come
across
the
magazine
articles
about
which
they
were
*NL*
disputing
,
and
had
read
them
,
interested
in
them
as
a
development
of
the
*NL*
first
principles
of
science
,
familiar
to
him
as
a
natural
science
*NL*
student
at
the
university
.
But
he
had
never
connected
these
scientific
*NL*
deductions
as
to
the
origin
of
man
as
an
animal
,
as
to
reflex
action
,
*NL*
biology
,
and
sociology
,
with
those
questions
as
to
the
meaning
of
life
*NL*
and
death
to
himself
,
which
had
of
late
been
more
and
more
often
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
listened
to
his
brother
's
argument
with
the
professor
,
he
noticed
*NL*
that
they
connected
these
scientific
questions
with
those
spiritual
*NL*
problems
,
that
at
times
they
almost
touched
on
the
latter
;
but
every
*NL*
time
they
were
close
upon
what
seemed
to
him
the
chief
point
,
they
*NL*
promptly
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
and
plunged
again
into
a
sea
of
subtle
*NL*
distinctions
,
reservations
,
quotations
,
allusions
,
and
appeals
to
*NL*
authorities
,
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
understood
what
they
*NL*
were
talking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
admit
it
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
with
his
habitual
*NL*
clearness
,
precision
of
expression
,
and
elegance
of
phrase
.
``
I
can
not
in
*NL*
any
case
agree
with
Keiss
that
my
whole
conception
of
the
external
world
*NL*
has
been
derived
from
perceptions
.
The
most
fundamental
idea
,
the
idea
*NL*
of
existence
,
has
not
been
received
by
me
through
sensation
;
indeed
,
*NL*
there
is
no
special
sense-organ
for
the
transmission
of
such
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
they
--
Wurt
,
and
Knaust
,
and
Pripasov
--
would
answer
that
your
*NL*
consciousness
of
existence
is
derived
from
the
conjunction
of
all
your
*NL*
sensations
,
that
that
consciousness
of
existence
is
the
result
of
your
*NL*
sensations
.
Wurt
,
indeed
,
says
plainly
that
,
assuming
there
are
no
*NL*
sensations
,
it
follows
that
there
is
no
idea
of
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
maintain
the
contrary
,
''
began
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
it
seemed
to
Levin
that
just
as
they
were
close
upon
the
real
*NL*
point
of
the
matter
,
they
were
again
retreating
,
and
he
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
put
a
question
to
the
professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
According
to
that
,
if
my
senses
are
annihilated
,
if
my
body
is
dead
,
I
*NL*
can
have
no
existence
of
any
sort
?
''
he
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
professor
,
in
annoyance
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
mental
suffering
at
the
*NL*
interruption
,
looked
round
at
the
strange
inquirer
,
more
like
a
bargeman
*NL*
than
a
philosopher
,
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
as
*NL*
though
to
ask
:
What
's
one
to
say
to
him
?
But
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
had
*NL*
been
talking
with
far
less
heat
and
one-sidedness
than
the
professor
,
*NL*
and
who
had
sufficient
breadth
of
mind
to
answer
the
professor
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
to
comprehend
the
simple
and
natural
point
of
view
from
*NL*
which
the
question
was
put
,
smiled
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
question
we
have
no
right
to
answer
as
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
not
the
requisite
data
,
''
chimed
in
the
professor
,
and
he
went
*NL*
back
to
his
argument
.
``
No
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
would
point
out
the
fact
that
*NL*
if
,
as
Pripasov
directly
asserts
,
perception
is
based
on
sensation
,
then
*NL*
we
are
bound
to
distinguish
sharply
between
these
two
conceptions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
listened
no
more
,
and
simply
waited
for
the
professor
to
go
.

When
the
professor
had
gone
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
turned
to
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
that
you
've
come
.
For
some
time
,
is
it
?
How
's
your
farming
*NL*
getting
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
knew
that
his
elder
brother
took
little
interest
in
farming
,
and
*NL*
only
put
the
question
in
deference
to
him
,
and
so
he
only
told
him
about
*NL*
the
sale
of
his
wheat
and
money
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
meant
to
tell
his
brother
of
his
determination
to
get
married
,
*NL*
and
to
ask
his
advice
;
he
had
indeed
firmly
resolved
to
do
so
.
But
after
*NL*
seeing
his
brother
,
listening
to
his
conversation
with
the
professor
,
*NL*
hearing
afterwards
the
unconsciously
patronizing
tone
in
which
his
*NL*
brother
questioned
him
about
agricultural
matters
-LRB-
their
mother
's
*NL*
property
had
not
been
divided
,
and
Levin
took
charge
of
both
their
*NL*
shares
-RRB-
,
Levin
felt
that
he
could
not
for
some
reason
begin
to
talk
to
*NL*
him
of
his
intention
of
marrying
.
He
felt
that
his
brother
would
not
*NL*
look
at
it
as
he
would
have
wished
him
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
your
district
council
doing
?
''
asked
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
*NL*
was
greatly
interested
in
these
local
boards
and
attached
great
*NL*
importance
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Why
,
surely
you
're
a
member
of
the
board
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
a
member
now
;
I
've
resigned

''
answered
Levin
,
``
and
I
no
*NL*
longer
attend
the
meetings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
''
commented
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
in
self-defense
began
to
describe
what
took
place
in
the
meetings
*NL*
in
his
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
it
always
is
!
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
interrupted
him
.
``
We
*NL*
Russians
are
always
like
that
.
Perhaps
it
's
our
strong
point
,
really
,
*NL*
the
faculty
of
seeing
our
own
shortcomings
;
but
we
overdo
it
,
we
comfort
*NL*
ourselves
with
irony
which
we
always
have
on
the
tip
of
our
tongues
.
All
*NL*
I
say
is
,
give
such
rights
as
our
local
self-government
to
any
other
*NL*
European
people
--
why
,
the
Germans
or
the
English
would
have
worked
their
*NL*
way
to
freedom
from
them
,
while
we
simply
turn
them
into
ridicule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
it
be
helped
?
''
said
Levin
penitently
.
``
It
was
my
last
*NL*
effort

And
I
did
try
with
all
my
soul

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not

said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
;

it
is

that
you
do
n't
look
at
it

you
should

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not

Levin
answered
dejectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
you
know
brother
Nikolay
's
turned
up
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
brother
Nikolay
was
the
elder
brother
of
Konstantin
Levin
,
and
*NL*
half-brother
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
;
a
man
utterly
ruined
,
who
had
*NL*
dissipated
the
greater
part
of
his
fortune
,
was
living
in
the
strangest
*NL*
and
lowest
company
,
and
had
quarreled
with
his
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say

Levin
cried
with
horror
.
``
How

*NL*
*NL*
``
Prokofy

him
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here

Where

Do
you
know

Levin
got
up
from
his
chair
,
*NL*
as
though
on
the
point
of
starting
off
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
I
told
you

said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
shaking
his
head
at
his
*NL*
younger
brother
's
excitement
.
``
I
sent
to
find
out
where
he

living

I
paid

the
answer

me

*NL*
*NL*
And
Sergey
Ivanovitch
took
a
note
from
under
a
paper-weight
and
handed
*NL*
it
to
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
read
in
the
queer
,
familiar
handwriting
:
``
I
humbly
beg
you
to
*NL*
leave
me
in
peace
.
That
's
the
only
favor
I
ask
of
my
gracious
*NL*
brothers
.
--
Nikolay
Levin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
read
it
,
and
without
raising
his
head
stood
with
the
note
in
his
*NL*
hands
opposite
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
struggle
in
his
heart
between
the
desire
to
forget
his
*NL*
unhappy
brother
for
the
time
,
and
the
consciousness
that
it
would
be
*NL*
base
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
obviously
wants
to
offend
me
,
''
pursued
Sergey
Ivanovitch
;
``
but
he
*NL*
can
not
offend
me
,
and
I
should
have
wished
with
all
my
heart
to
assist
*NL*
him
,
but
I
know
it
's
impossible
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
repeated
Levin
.
``
I
understand
and
appreciate
your
attitude
*NL*
to
him
;
but
I
shall
go
and
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
,
do
;
but
I
should
n't
advise
it
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
``
As
regards
myself
,
I
have
no
fear
of
your
doing
so
;
he
will
not
make
*NL*
you
quarrel
with
me
;
but
for
your
own
sake
,
I
should
say
you
would
do
*NL*
better
not
to
go
.
You
ca
n't
do
him
any
good
;
still
,
do
as
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
I
ca
n't
do
any
good
,
but
I
feel
--
especially
at
such
a
*NL*
moment
--
but
that
's
another
thing
--
I
feel
I
could
not
be
at
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
One
thing
I
do
*NL*
understand
,
''
he
added
;
``
it
's
a
lesson
in
humility
.
I
have
come
to
look
*NL*
very
differently
and
more
charitably
on
what
is
called
infamous
since
*NL*
brother
Nikolay
has
become
what
he
is
...
you
know
what
he
did
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
awful
,
awful
!
''
repeated
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
obtaining
his
brother
's
address
from
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
footman
,
*NL*
Levin
was
on
the
point
of
setting
off
at
once
to
see
him
,
but
on
second
*NL*
thought
he
decided
to
put
off
his
visit
till
the
evening
.
The
first
*NL*
thing
to
do
to
set
his
heart
at
rest
was
to
accomplish
what
he
had
come
*NL*
to
Moscow
for
.
From
his
brother
's
Levin
went
to
Oblonsky
's
office
,
and
*NL*
on
getting
news
of
the
Shtcherbatskys
from
him
,
he
drove
to
the
place
*NL*
where
he
had
been
told
he
might
find
Kitty
.

*NL*
Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
,
conscious
of
his
throbbing
heart
,
Levin
stepped
out
of
*NL*
a
hired
sledge
at
the
Zoological
Gardens
,
and
turned
along
the
path
to
*NL*
the
frozen
mounds
and
the
skating
ground
,
knowing
that
he
would
*NL*
certainly
find
her
there
,
as
he
had
seen
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
carriage
at
*NL*
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bright
,
frosty
day
.
Rows
of
carriages
,
sledges
,
drivers
,
and
*NL*
policemen
were
standing
in
the
approach
.
Crowds
of
well-dressed
people
,
*NL*
with
hats
bright
in
the
sun
,
swarmed
about
the
entrance
and
along
the
*NL*
well-swept
little
paths
between
the
little
houses
adorned
with
carving
*NL*
in
the
Russian
style
.
The
old
curly
birches
of
the
gardens
,
all
their
*NL*
twigs
laden
with
snow
,
looked
as
though
freshly
decked
in
sacred
*NL*
vestments
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
the
path
towards
the
skating-ground
,
and
kept
saying
to
*NL*
himself
--
``
You
must
n't
be
excited
,
you
must
be
calm
.
What
's
the
matter
*NL*
with
you
?
What
do
you
want
?
Be
quiet
,
stupid
,
''
he
conjured
his
heart
.
*NL*
And
the
more
he
tried
to
compose
himself
,
the
more
breathless
he
found
*NL*
himself
.
An
acquaintance
met
him
and
called
him
by
his
name
,
but
Levin
*NL*
did
not
even
recognize
him
.
He
went
towards
the
mounds
,
whence
came
the
*NL*
clank
of
the
chains
of
sledges
as
they
slipped
down
or
were
dragged
up
,
*NL*
the
rumble
of
the
sliding
sledges
,
and
the
sounds
of
merry
voices
.
He
*NL*
walked
on
a
few
steps
,
and
the
skating-ground
lay
open
before
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
at
once
,
amidst
all
the
skaters
,
he
knew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
she
was
there
by
the
rapture
and
the
terror
that
seized
on
his
*NL*
heart
.
She
was
standing
talking
to
a
lady
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
*NL*
ground
.
There
was
apparently
nothing
striking
either
in
her
dress
or
her
*NL*
attitude
.
But
for
Levin
she
was
as
easy
to
find
in
that
crowd
as
a
rose
*NL*
among
nettles
.
Everything
was
made
bright
by
her
.
She
was
the
smile
that
*NL*
shed
light
on
all
round
her
.
``
Is
it
possible
I
can
go
over
there
on
the
*NL*
ice
,
go
up
to
her
?
''
he
thought
.
The
place
where
she
stood
seemed
to
him
*NL*
a
holy
shrine
,
unapproachable
,
and
there
was
one
moment
when
he
was
*NL*
almost
retreating
,
so
overwhelmed
was
he
with
terror
.
He
had
to
make
an
*NL*
effort
to
master
himself
,
and
to
remind
himself
that
people
of
all
sorts
*NL*
were
moving
about
her
,
and
that
he
too
might
come
there
to
skate
.
He
*NL*
walked
down
,
for
a
long
while
avoiding
looking
at
her
as
at
the
sun
,
but
*NL*
seeing
her
,
as
one
does
the
sun
,
without
looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
day
of
the
week
and
at
that
time
of
day
people
of
one
set
,
all
*NL*
acquainted
with
one
another
,
used
to
meet
on
the
ice
.
There
were
crack
*NL*
skaters
there
,
showing
off
their
skill
,
and
learners
clinging
to
chairs
*NL*
with
timid
,
awkward
movements
,
boys
,
and
elderly
people
skating
with
*NL*
hygienic
motives
.
They
seemed
to
Levin
an
elect
band
of
blissful
beings
*NL*
because
they
were
here
,
near
her
.
All
the
skaters
,
it
seemed
,
with
*NL*
perfect
self-possession
,
skated
towards
her
,
skated
by
her
,
even
spoke
*NL*
to
her
,
and
were
happy
,
quite
apart
from
her
,
enjoying
the
capital
ice
*NL*
and
the
fine
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
Shtcherbatsky
,
Kitty
's
cousin
,
in
a
short
jacket
and
tight
*NL*
trousers
,
was
sitting
on
a
garden
seat
with
his
skates
on
.
Seeing
Levin
,
*NL*
he
shouted
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
first
skater
in
Russia
!
Been
here
long
?
First-rate
ice
--
do
put
*NL*
your
skates
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
my
skates
,
''
Levin
answered
,
marveling
at
this
boldness
*NL*
and
ease
in
her
presence
,
and
not
for
one
second
losing
sight
of
her
,
*NL*
though
he
did
not
look
at
her
.
He
felt
as
though
the
sun
were
coming
*NL*
near
him
.
She
was
in
a
corner
,
and
turning
out
her
slender
feet
in
their
*NL*
high
boots
with
obvious
timidity
,
she
skated
towards
him
.
A
boy
in
*NL*
Russian
dress
,
desperately
waving
his
arms
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
overtook
her
.
She
skated
a
little
uncertainly
;
taking
her
hands
out
of
*NL*
the
little
muff
that
hung
on
a
cord
,
she
held
them
ready
for
emergency
,
*NL*
and
looking
towards
Levin
,
whom
she
had
recognized
,
she
smiled
at
him
,
*NL*
and
at
her
own
fears
.
When
she
had
got
round
the
turn
,
she
gave
herself
*NL*
a
push
off
with
one
foot
,
and
skated
straight
up
to
Shtcherbatsky
.
*NL*
Clutching
at
his
arm
,
she
nodded
smiling
to
Levin
.
She
was
more
splendid
*NL*
than
he
had
imagined
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
thought
of
her
,
he
could
call
up
a
vivid
picture
of
her
to
*NL*
himself
,
especially
the
charm
of
that
little
fair
head
,
so
freely
set
on
*NL*
the
shapely
girlish
shoulders
,
and
so
full
of
childish
brightness
and
*NL*
good
humor
.
The
childishness
of
her
expression
,
together
with
the
*NL*
delicate
beauty
of
her
figure
,
made
up
her
special
charm
,
and
that
he
*NL*
fully
realized
.
But
what
always
struck
him
in
her
as
something
unlooked
*NL*
for
,
was
the
expression
of
her
eyes
,
soft
,
serene
,
and
truthful
,
and
*NL*
above
all
,
her
smile
,
which
always
transported
Levin
to
an
enchanted
*NL*
world
,
where
he
felt
himself
softened
and
tender
,
as
he
remembered
*NL*
himself
in
some
days
of
his
early
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
here
long
?
''
she
said
,
giving
him
her
hand
.
``
Thank
you
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
as
he
picked
up
the
handkerchief
that
had
fallen
out
of
her
*NL*
muff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
've
not
long
...
yesterday
...
I
mean
today
...
I
arrived
,
''
*NL*
answered
Levin
,
in
his
emotion
not
at
once
understanding
her
question
.
*NL*
``
I
was
meaning
to
come
and
see
you
,
''
he
said
;
and
then
,
recollecting
*NL*
with
what
intention
he
was
trying
to
see
her
,
he
was
promptly
overcome
*NL*
with
confusion
and
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
you
could
skate
,
and
skate
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
earnestly
,
as
though
wishing
to
make
out
the
cause
of
*NL*
his
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
praise
is
worth
having
.
The
tradition
is
kept
up
here
that
you
are
*NL*
the
best
of
skaters
,
''
she
said
,
with
her
little
black-gloved
hand
*NL*
brushing
a
grain
of
hoarfrost
off
her
muff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
used
once
to
skate
with
passion
;
I
wanted
to
reach
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
everything
with
passion
,
I
think
,
''
she
said
smiling
.
``
I
should
*NL*
so
like
to
see
how
you
skate
.
Put
on
skates
,
and
let
us
skate
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Skate
together
!
Can
that
be
possible
?
''
thought
Levin
,
gazing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
put
them
on
directly
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
off
to
get
skates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
while
since
we
've
seen
you
here
,
sir
,
''
said
the
attendant
,
*NL*
supporting
his
foot
,
and
screwing
on
the
heel
of
the
skate
.
``
Except
you
,
*NL*
there
's
none
of
the
gentlemen
first-rate
skaters
.
Will
that
be
all
*NL*
right
?
''
said
he
,
tightening
the
strap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
yes
;
make
haste
,
please
,
''
answered
Levin
,
with
difficulty
*NL*
restraining
the
smile
of
rapture
which
would
overspread
his
face
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
``
this
now
is
life
,
this
is
happiness
!
_
Together
,
_
she
said
;
*NL*
_
let
us
skate
together
!
_
Speak
to
her
now
?
But
that
's
just
why
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
to
speak
--
because
I
'm
happy
now
,
happy
in
hope
,
anyway
...
And
*NL*
then
?
...
But
I
must
!
I
must
!
I
must
!
Away
with
weakness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
rose
to
his
feet
,
took
off
his
overcoat
,
and
scurrying
over
the
*NL*
rough
ice
round
the
hut
,
came
out
on
the
smooth
ice
and
skated
without
*NL*
effort
,
as
it
were
,
by
simple
exercise
of
will
,
increasing
and
*NL*
slackening
speed
and
turning
his
course
.
He
approached
with
timidity
,
*NL*
but
again
her
smile
reassured
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
they
set
off
side
by
side
,
going
faster
and
*NL*
faster
,
and
the
more
rapidly
they
moved
the
more
tightly
she
grasped
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
I
should
soon
learn
;
I
somehow
feel
confidence
in
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
confidence
in
myself
when
you
are
leaning
on
me
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
but
was
at
once
panic-stricken
at
what
he
had
said
,
and
blushed
.
And
*NL*
indeed
,
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
these
words
,
when
all
at
once
,
like
the
*NL*
sun
going
behind
a
cloud
,
her
face
lost
all
its
friendliness
,
and
Levin
*NL*
detected
the
familiar
change
in
her
expression
that
denoted
the
working
*NL*
of
thought
;
a
crease
showed
on
her
smooth
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
troubling
you
?
--
though
I
've
no
right
to
ask
such
a
*NL*
question
,
''
he
added
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
so
?
...
No
,
I
have
nothing
to
trouble
me
,
''
she
responded
*NL*
coldly
;
and
she
added
immediately
:
``
You
have
n't
seen
Mlle.
Linon
,
have
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
speak
to
her
,
she
likes
you
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
wrong
?
I
have
offended
her
.
Lord
help
me
!
''
thought
Levin
,
and
he
*NL*
flew
towards
the
old
Frenchwoman
with
the
gray
ringlets
,
who
was
sitting
*NL*
on
a
bench
.
Smiling
and
showing
her
false
teeth
,
she
greeted
him
as
an
*NL*
old
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
see
we
're
growing
up
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
glancing
towards
*NL*
Kitty
,
``
and
growing
old
.
_
Tiny
bear
_
has
grown
big
now
!
''
pursued
the
*NL*
Frenchwoman
,
laughing
,
and
she
reminded
him
of
his
joke
about
the
three
*NL*
young
ladies
whom
he
had
compared
to
the
three
bears
in
the
English
*NL*
nursery
tale
.
``
Do
you
remember
that
's
what
you
used
to
call
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
absolutely
nothing
,
but
she
had
been
laughing
at
the
joke
*NL*
for
ten
years
now
,
and
was
fond
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
go
and
skate
,
go
and
skate
.
Our
Kitty
has
learned
to
skate
nicely
,
*NL*
has
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
darted
up
to
Kitty
her
face
was
no
longer
stern
;
her
eyes
*NL*
looked
at
him
with
the
same
sincerity
and
friendliness
,
but
Levin
*NL*
fancied
that
in
her
friendliness
there
was
a
certain
note
of
deliberate
*NL*
composure
.
And
he
felt
depressed
.
After
talking
a
little
of
her
old
*NL*
governess
and
her
peculiarities
,
she
questioned
him
about
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
must
be
dull
in
the
country
in
the
winter
,
are
n't
you
?
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
dull
,
I
am
very
busy
,
''
he
said
,
feeling
that
she
was
*NL*
holding
him
in
check
by
her
composed
tone
,
which
he
would
not
have
the
*NL*
force
to
break
through
,
just
as
it
had
been
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
stay
in
town
long
?
''
Kitty
questioned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
answered
,
not
thinking
of
what
he
was
saying
.
The
*NL*
thought
that
if
he
were
held
in
check
by
her
tone
of
quiet
friendliness
*NL*
he
would
end
by
going
back
again
without
deciding
anything
came
into
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
he
resolved
to
make
a
struggle
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
you
do
n't
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
It
depends
upon
you
,
''
he
said
,
and
was
immediately
*NL*
horror-stricken
at
his
own
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
that
she
had
heard
his
words
,
or
that
she
did
not
want
to
*NL*
hear
them
,
she
made
a
sort
of
stumble
,
twice
struck
out
,
and
hurriedly
*NL*
skated
away
from
him
.
She
skated
up
to
Mlle.
Linon
,
said
something
to
*NL*
her
,
and
went
towards
the
pavilion
where
the
ladies
took
off
their
*NL*
skates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
what
have
I
done
!
Merciful
God
!
help
me
,
guide
me
,
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
praying
inwardly
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
feeling
a
need
of
violent
*NL*
exercise
,
he
skated
about
describing
inner
and
outer
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
one
of
the
young
men
,
the
best
of
the
skaters
of
the
day
,
*NL*
came
out
of
the
coffee-house
in
his
skates
,
with
a
cigarette
in
his
*NL*
mouth
.
Taking
a
run
,
he
dashed
down
the
steps
in
his
skates
,
crashing
*NL*
and
bounding
up
and
down
.
He
flew
down
,
and
without
even
changing
the
*NL*
position
of
his
hands
,
skated
away
over
the
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
a
new
trick
!
''
said
Levin
,
and
he
promptly
ran
up
to
the
top
*NL*
to
do
this
new
trick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
break
your
neck
!
it
needs
practice
!
''
Nikolay
Shtcherbatsky
*NL*
shouted
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
to
the
steps
,
took
a
run
from
above
as
best
he
could
,
and
*NL*
dashed
down
,
preserving
his
balance
in
this
unwonted
movement
with
his
*NL*
hands
.
On
the
last
step
he
stumbled
,
but
barely
touching
the
ice
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
with
a
violent
effort
recovered
himself
,
and
skated
off
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
splendid
,
how
nice
he
is
!
''
Kitty
was
thinking
at
that
time
,
as
she
*NL*
came
out
of
the
pavilion
with
Mlle.
Linon
,
and
looked
towards
him
with
a
*NL*
smile
of
quiet
affection
,
as
though
he
were
a
favorite
brother
.
``
And
can
*NL*
it
be
my
fault
,
can
I
have
done
anything
wrong
?
They
talk
of
flirtation
.
*NL*
I
know
it
's
not
he
that
I
love
;
but
still
I
am
happy
with
him
,
and
he
's
*NL*
so
jolly
.
Only
,
why
did
he
say
that
?
...
''
she
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catching
sight
of
Kitty
going
away
,
and
her
mother
meeting
her
at
the
*NL*
steps
,
Levin
,
flushed
from
his
rapid
exercise
,
stood
still
and
pondered
*NL*
a
minute
.
He
took
off
his
skates
,
and
overtook
the
mother
and
daughter
*NL*
at
the
entrance
of
the
gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
to
see
you
,
''
said
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
.
``
On
Thursdays
we
*NL*
are
home
,
as
always
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Today
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
,
''
the
princess
said
stiffly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stiffness
hurt
Kitty
,
and
she
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
smooth
*NL*
over
her
mother
's
coldness
.
She
turned
her
head
,
and
with
a
smile
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
till
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
his
hat
cocked
on
one
side
,
with
*NL*
beaming
face
and
eyes
,
strode
into
the
garden
like
a
conquering
hero
.
*NL*
But
as
he
approached
his
mother-in-law
,
he
responded
in
a
mournful
and
*NL*
crestfallen
tone
to
her
inquiries
about
Dolly
's
health
.
After
a
little
*NL*
subdued
and
dejected
conversation
with
his
mother-in-law
,
he
threw
out
*NL*
his
chest
again
,
and
put
his
arm
in
Levin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
shall
we
set
off
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
've
been
thinking
about
you
all
*NL*
this
time
,
and
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
you
've
come
,
''
he
said
,
looking
him
in
*NL*
the
face
with
a
significant
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
come
along
,
''
answered
Levin
in
ecstasy
,
hearing
unceasingly
the
*NL*
sound
of
that
voice
saying
,
``
Good-bye
till
this
evening
,
''
and
seeing
the
*NL*
smile
with
which
it
was
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
England
or
the
Hermitage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
which
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
the
England
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
selecting
that
*NL*
restaurant
because
he
owed
more
there
than
at
the
Hermitage
,
and
*NL*
consequently
considered
it
mean
to
avoid
it
.
``
Have
you
got
a
sledge
?
*NL*
That
's
first-rate
,
for
I
sent
my
carriage
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
friends
hardly
spoke
all
the
way
.
Levin
was
wondering
what
that
*NL*
change
in
Kitty
's
expression
had
meant
,
and
alternately
assuring
himself
*NL*
that
there
was
hope
,
and
falling
into
despair
,
seeing
clearly
that
his
*NL*
hopes
were
insane
,
and
yet
all
the
while
he
felt
himself
quite
another
*NL*
man
,
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
been
before
her
smile
and
those
words
,
*NL*
``
Good-bye
till
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
absorbed
during
the
drive
in
composing
the
menu
*NL*
of
the
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
turbot
,
do
n't
you
?
''
he
said
to
Levin
as
they
were
arriving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
responded
Levin
.
``
Turbot
?
Yes
,
I
'm
_
awfully
_
fond
of
turbot
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
went
into
the
restaurant
with
Oblonsky
,
he
could
not
help
*NL*
noticing
a
certain
peculiarity
of
expression
,
as
it
were
,
a
restrained
*NL*
radiance
,
about
the
face
and
whole
figure
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
Oblonsky
took
off
his
overcoat
,
and
with
his
hat
over
one
ear
walked
*NL*
into
the
dining
room
,
giving
directions
to
the
Tatar
waiters
,
who
were
*NL*
clustered
about
him
in
evening
coats
,
bearing
napkins
.
Bowing
to
right
*NL*
and
left
to
the
people
he
met
,
and
here
as
everywhere
joyously
greeting
*NL*
acquaintances
,
he
went
up
to
the
sideboard
for
a
preliminary
appetizer
*NL*
of
fish
and
vodka
,
and
said
to
the
painted
Frenchwoman
decked
in
*NL*
ribbons
,
lace
,
and
ringlets
,
behind
the
counter
,
something
so
amusing
*NL*
that
even
that
Frenchwoman
was
moved
to
genuine
laughter
.
Levin
for
his
*NL*
part
refrained
from
taking
any
vodka
simply
because
he
felt
such
a
*NL*
loathing
of
that
Frenchwoman
,
all
made
up
,
it
seemed
,
of
false
hair
,
*NL*
_
poudre
de
riz
,
_
and
_
vinaigre
de
toilette
_
.
He
made
haste
to
move
away
*NL*
from
her
,
as
from
a
dirty
place
.
His
whole
soul
was
filled
with
memories
*NL*
of
Kitty
,
and
there
was
a
smile
of
triumph
and
happiness
shining
in
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
your
excellency
,
please
.
Your
excellency
wo
n't
be
disturbed
*NL*
here
,
''
said
a
particularly
pertinacious
,
white-headed
old
Tatar
with
*NL*
immense
hips
and
coat-tails
gaping
widely
behind
.
``
Walk
in
,
your
*NL*
excellency
,
''
he
said
to
Levin
;
by
way
of
showing
his
respect
to
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
being
attentive
to
his
guest
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
flinging
a
fresh
cloth
over
the
round
table
under
the
bronze
*NL*
chandelier
,
though
it
already
had
a
table
cloth
on
it
,
he
pushed
up
*NL*
velvet
chairs
,
and
came
to
a
standstill
before
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
*NL*
a
napkin
and
a
bill
of
fare
in
his
hands
,
awaiting
his
commands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
prefer
it
,
your
excellency
,
a
private
room
will
be
free

directly

Golistin

a
lady
.
Fresh
oysters
have
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
oysters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
became
thoughtful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
if
we
were
to
change
our
program
,
Levin
?
''
he
said
,
keeping
his
*NL*
finger
on
the
bill
of
fare
.
And
his
face
expressed
serious
hesitation
.
*NL*
``
Are
the
oysters
good
?
Mind
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're

*NL*
*NL*
``

do

are

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
arrived
yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
how
if
we
were
to
begin
with
oysters

and
so
change
the
*NL*
whole
program

Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
the
same
to
me
.
I
should
like
cabbage
soup
and
porridge
better
*NL*
than
anything

but
of
course
there
's
nothing
like
that
here

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Porridge

said
the
Tatar
,
bending
*NL*
down
to
Levin
,
like
a
nurse
speaking
to
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
joking
apart
,
whatever
you
choose
is
sure
to
be
good

I
've
been
*NL*
skating
,
and
I
'm
hungry
.
And
do
n't
imagine
,
''
he
added
,
detecting
a
look
*NL*
of
dissatisfaction
on
Oblonsky
's
face
,
``
that
I
sha
n't
appreciate
your
*NL*
choice

I
am
fond
of
good
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
hope
so
!
After
all
,
it
's
one
of
the
pleasures
of
life

said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Well
,
then
,
my
friend
,
you
give
us
two
--
or
better
*NL*
say
three

dozen
oysters

clear
soup
with
vegetables

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Printaniere
,
_
''
prompted
the
Tatar
.
But
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
apparently
*NL*
did
not
care
to
allow
him
the
satisfaction
of
giving
the
French
names
of
*NL*
the
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
vegetables
in
it

you
know

Then

*NL*
roast

and
mind
it
's
good

Yes
,
and
capons
,
perhaps
,
and
then
*NL*
sweets

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tatar
,
recollecting
that
it
was
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
way
not
to
*NL*
call
the
dishes
by
the
names
in
the
French
bill
of
fare
,
did
not
repeat
*NL*
them
after
him
,
but
could
not
resist
rehearsing
the
whole
menu
to
*NL*
himself
according
to
the
bill
:
--

poulard

etc.
,
''
and
*NL*
then
instantly
,
as
though
worked
by
springs
,
laying
down
one
bound
bill
*NL*
of
fare
,
he
took
up
another
,
the
list
of
wines
,
and
submitted
it
to
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
drink
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

to
start
with

You
're
right

I
dare

white
seal

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Cachet

prompted
the
Tatar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it
's
all
the

said
Levin
,
unable
to
suppress
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
Tatar
ran
off
with
flying
coat-tails
,
and
in
five
minutes
darted
*NL*
in
with
a
dish
of
opened
oysters
on
mother-of-pearl
shells
,
and
a
bottle
*NL*
between
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
crushed
the
starchy
napkin
,
tucked
it
into
his
*NL*
waistcoat
,
and
settling
his
arms
comfortably
,
started
on
the
oysters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
bad
,
''
he
said
,
stripping
the
oysters
from
the
pearly
shell
with
a
*NL*
silver
fork
,
and
swallowing
them
one
after
another
.
``
Not
bad
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
turning
his
dewy
,
brilliant
eyes
from
Levin
to
the
Tatar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
ate
the
oysters
indeed
,
though
white
bread
and
cheese
would
have
*NL*
pleased
him
better
.
But
he
was
admiring
Oblonsky
.
Even
the
Tatar
,
*NL*
uncorking
the
bottle
and
pouring
the
sparkling
wine
into
the
delicate
*NL*
glasses
,
glanced
at
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
settled
his
white
cravat
*NL*
with
a
perceptible
smile
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
care
much
for
oysters
,
do
you
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
emptying
his
wine
glass
,
``
or
you
're
worried
about
something
.
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
Levin
to
be
in
good
spirits
.
But
it
was
not
that
Levin
was
not
*NL*
in
good
spirits
;
he
was
ill
at
ease
.
With
what
he
had
in
his
soul
,
he
*NL*
felt
sore
and
uncomfortable
in
the
restaurant
,
in
the
midst
of
private
*NL*
rooms
where
men
were
dining
with
ladies
,
in
all
this
fuss
and
bustle
;
*NL*
the
surroundings
of
bronzes
,
looking
glasses
,
gas
,
and
waiters
--
all
of
*NL*
it
was
offensive
to
him
.
He
was
afraid
of
sullying
what
his
soul
was
*NL*
brimful
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Yes
,
I
am
;
but
besides
,
all
this
bothers
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
ca
n't
*NL*
conceive
how
queer
it
all
seems
to
a
country
person
like
me
,
as
queer
as
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
nails
I
saw
at
your
place
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
how
much
interested
you
were
in
poor
Grinevitch
's
nails
,
''
*NL*
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
much
for
me
,
''
responded
Levin
.
``
Do
try
,
now
,
and
put
yourself
*NL*
in
my
place
,
take
the
point
of
view
of
a
country
person
.
We
in
the
*NL*
country
try
to
bring
our
hands
into
such
a
state
as
will
be
most
*NL*
convenient
for
working
with
.
So
we
cut
our
nails
;
sometimes
we
turn
up
*NL*
our
sleeves
.
And
here
people
purposely
let
their
nails
grow
as
long
as
*NL*
they
will
,
and
link
on
small
saucers
by
way
of
studs
,
so
that
they
can
*NL*
do
nothing
with
their
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
that
's
just
a
sign
that
he
has
no
need
to
do
coarse
work
.
His
*NL*
work
is
with
the
mind
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
.
But
still
it
's
queer
to
me
,
just
as
at
this
moment
it
seems
*NL*
queer
to
me
that
we
country
folks
try
to
get
our
meals
over
as
soon
as
*NL*
we
can
,
so
as
to
be
ready
for
our
work
,
while
here
are
we
trying
to
drag
*NL*
out
our
meal
as
long
as
possible
,
and
with
that
object
eating
*NL*
oysters
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
,
''
objected
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
But
that
's
just
the
aim
*NL*
of
civilization
--
to
make
everything
a
source
of
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
's
its
aim
,
I
'd
rather
be
a
savage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
are
a
savage
.
All
you
Levins
are
savages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
sighed
.
He
remembered
his
brother
Nikolay
,
and
felt
ashamed
and
*NL*
sore
,
and
he
scowled
;
but
Oblonsky
began
speaking
of
a
subject
which
at
*NL*
once
drew
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
are
you
going
tonight
to
our
people
,
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
,
I
*NL*
mean
?
''
he
said
,
his
eyes
sparkling
significantly
as
he
pushed
away
the
*NL*
empty
rough
shells
,
and
drew
the
cheese
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
certainly
go
,
''
replied
Levin
;
``
though
I
fancied
the
*NL*
princess
was
not
very
warm
in
her
invitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
That
's
her
manner
...
Come
,
boy
,
the
soup
!
...
That
's
*NL*
her
manner
--
_
grande
dame

_
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
I
'm
coming

too
,
*NL*
but
I
have
to
go
to
the
Countess
Bonina
's
rehearsal

Come
,
is
n't
it
true
*NL*
that
you
're
a
savage
?
How
do
you
explain
the
sudden
way
in
which
you
*NL*
vanished
from
Moscow
?
The
Shtcherbatskys
were
continually
asking
me
*NL*
about
you
,
as
though
I
ought
to
know

The
only
thing
I
know
is
that
you

always
do
what
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Levin

slowly
and
with
emotion
,
``
you
're
right

I
am
a

Only

my

is
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

broke
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch

looking
*NL*
into
Levin
's
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
declaimed
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.

Everything

``
No

*NL*
``
How
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Stepan
Arkadyevitch

``
Well

come
to
Moscow

then

take
away
!

he
called
to
the
Tatar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
guess
?
''
responded
Levin
,
his
eyes
like
deep
wells
of
light
fixed
on
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess

but
I
ca

talk

it

You
can
see
by
that

whether
I
guess
right

wrong

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
gazing
at
*NL*
Levin
with
a
subtle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
?
''
said
Levin
in
a
quivering
voice
,
*NL*
feeling
that
all
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
quivering
too
.
``
How
do
you
*NL*
look
at
the
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
slowly
emptied
his
glass
of
Chablis
,
never
taking
*NL*
his
eyes
off
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
``
there
's
nothing
I
desire
so
much
as
*NL*
that

nothing

It
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
not
making
a
mistake

You

what
we

said
*NL*
Levin
,
piercing
him
with
his
eyes
.

You

*NL*
*NL*

No

Indeed
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
think
that
?

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
at
his
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
so
to
me
sometimes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

well

anyway
there
's
nothing
awful

Every

*NL*
proud
of
an
offer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
every
girl
,
but
not
she

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
.
He
so
well
knew
that
feeling
of
Levin
's
,
*NL*
that
for
him
all
the
girls
in
the
world
were
divided
into
two
classes
:
*NL*
one
class
--
all
the
girls
in
the
world
except
her
,
and
those
girls
with
*NL*
all
sorts
of
human
weaknesses
,
and
very
ordinary
girls
:
the
other
*NL*
class
--
she
alone
,
having
no
weaknesses
of
any
sort
and
higher
than
all
*NL*
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
take
some
sauce
,
''
he
said
,
holding
back
Levin
's
hand
as
it
pushed
*NL*
away
the
sauce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
obediently
helped
himself
to
sauce
,
but
would
not
let
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
go
on
with
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
stop
a
minute
,
stop
a
minute
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
must
understand
that
*NL*
it
's
a
question
of
life
and
death
for
me

I
have
never
spoken
to
any
one
*NL*
of
this
.
And
there
's
no
one
I
could
speak
of
it
to

except
you
.
You
know
*NL*
we
're
utterly
unlike
each
other

different
tastes
and
views
and
*NL*
everything
;
but
I
know
you
're
fond
of
me

understand
me

and
that
's
*NL*
why
I
like
you
awfully

for
God

be
quite
straightforward

with
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
I
think

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
.
``
But
I
'll
*NL*
say
more
:
my
wife
is
a
wonderful
woman

Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sighed
,
*NL*
remembering
his
position
with
his
wife
,
and
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
*NL*
resumed
--
``
She
has
a
gift
of
foreseeing
things
.
She
sees
right
through
*NL*
people
;
but
that
's
not
all
;
she
knows
what
will
come
to
pass
,
especially
*NL*
in
the
way
of
marriages
.
She
foretold
,
for
instance
,
that
Princess
*NL*
Shahovskaya
would
marry
Brenteln
.
No
one
would
believe
it
,
but
it
came
*NL*
to
pass
.
And
she
's
on
your
side

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
only
that
she
likes
you

says
that

certain
to
be

your
wife

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Levin
's
face
suddenly
lighted
up
with
a
smile
,
a
smile
*NL*
not
far
from
tears
of
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
that

cried
Levin

``
I
always

was
exquisite

There

enough

it

he
said

getting
up
*NL*
from
his
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

sit
down

*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
could
not
sit
down

He
walked
with
his
firm
tread
twice
up
and
*NL*
down
the
little
cage
of
a
room
,
blinked
his
eyelids
that
his
tears
might
*NL*
not
fall
,
and
only
then
sat
down
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
understand

said
he
,
``

not
my

a
sort

force
outside

*NL*
taken
possession

I
went
away

awful

are
brought
*NL*
all
at

so
near
to
a
creature
pure
and
innocent

it
's
loathsome

that

why

feeling

unworthy

Levin
emptied
his
glass
,
and
they
were
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

Stepan

directed
the
Tatar
,
who
*NL*
was
filling
up
their
glasses
and
fidgeting
round
them
just
when
he
was
*NL*
not
wanted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

``
Who

Levin

his

was
suddenly
transformed
from

the
look
of
childlike
ecstasy

Oblonsky
had
just
been
admiring
to

an
angry

unpleasant

*NL*
``
Vronsky
is
one
of
the
sons
of
Count
Kirill
Ivanovitch
Vronsky
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
finest
specimens
of
the
gilded
youth
of
Petersburg
.
I
made
his
*NL*
acquaintance
in
Tver
when
I
was
there
on
official
business
,
and
he
came
*NL*
there
for
the
levy
of
recruits
.
Fearfully
rich
,
handsome
,
great
*NL*
connections
,
an
aide-de-camp
,
and
with
all
that
a
very
nice
,
*NL*
good-natured
fellow
.
But
he
's
more
than
simply
a
good-natured
fellow
,
as
*NL*
I
've
found
out
here
--
he
's
a
cultivated
man
,
too
,
and
very
intelligent
;
*NL*
he
's
a
man
who
'll
make
his
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
scowled
and
was
dumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
turned
up
here
soon
after
you
'd
gone
,
and
as
I
can
see
,
he
's
*NL*
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
Kitty
,
and
you
know
that
her
mother
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
but
I
know
nothing
,
''
said
Levin
,
frowning
gloomily
.
And
*NL*
immediately
he
recollected
his
brother
Nikolay
and
how
hateful
he
was
to
*NL*
have
been
able
to
forget
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wait
a
bit
,
wait
a
bit
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
and
*NL*
touching
his
hand
.
``
I
've
told
you
what
I
know
,
and
I
repeat
that
in
this
*NL*
delicate
and
tender
matter
,
as
far
as
one
can
conjecture
,
I
believe
the
*NL*
chances
are
in
your
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
dropped
back
in
his
chair
;
his
face
was
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
advise
you
to
settle
the
thing
as
soon
as
may
be
,
''
pursued
*NL*
Oblonsky
,
filling
up
his
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thanks
,
I
ca
n't
drink
any
more
,
''
said
Levin
,
pushing
away
his
*NL*
glass
.
``
I
shall
be
drunk
...
Come
,
tell
me
how
are
you
getting
on
?
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
obviously
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
word
more
:
in
any
case
I
advise
you
to
settle
the
question
soon
.
*NL*
Tonight
I
do
n't
advise
you
to
speak

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Go
*NL*
round
tomorrow
morning
,
make
an
offer
in
due
form
,
and
God
bless
you
...

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
still
think
of
coming
to
me
for
some
shooting
?
Come
next
*NL*
spring

''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
his
whole
soul
was
full
of
remorse
that
he
had
begun
this
*NL*
conversation
with
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
A
feeling
such
as
his
was
*NL*
profaned
by
talk
of
the
rivalry
of
some
Petersburg
officer
,
of
the
*NL*
suppositions
and
the
counsels
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
.
He
knew
what
was
passing
in
Levin
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
some
day
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
women
,
my
boy
,
they
're
the
pivot
*NL*
everything
turns
upon

Things
are
in
a
bad
way
with
me
,
very
bad
.
And
*NL*
it
's
all
through
women
.
Tell
me
frankly
now
,
''
he
pursued
,
picking
up
a
*NL*
cigar
and
keeping
one
hand
on
his
glass
;
``
give
me
your
advice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
.
Suppose
you
're
married
,
you
love
your
wife
,
but
you
're
*NL*
fascinated
by
another
woman
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
but
I
'm
absolutely
unable
to
comprehend
how
...
just
as
I
*NL*
ca
n't
comprehend
how
I
could
now
,
after
my
dinner
,
go
straight
to
a
*NL*
baker
's
shop
and
steal
a
roll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
eyes
sparkled
more
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
A
roll
will
sometimes
smell
so
good
one
ca
n't
resist
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Himmlisch

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
subtly
.
Levin
,
too
,
could
*NL*
not
help
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
joking
apart
,
''
resumed
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
``
you
must
*NL*
understand
that
the
woman
is
a
sweet
,
gentle
loving
creature
,
poor
and
*NL*
lonely

and
has
sacrificed
everything

Now
,
when
the
thing
's
done

you
see
,
can
one
possibly
cast

off

from

so

break
up

feeling
for

setting
her
on
her
feet

softening
her
lot

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
excuse
me
there
.
You
know
to
me
all
women
are
divided
*NL*
into
two
classes
...
at
least
no
...
truer
to
say
:
there
are
women
and
*NL*
there
are
...
I
've
never
seen
exquisite
fallen
beings
,
and
I
never
shall
*NL*
see
them
,
but
such
creatures
as
that
painted
Frenchwoman
at
the
counter
*NL*
with
the
ringlets
are
vermin
to
my
mind
,
and
all
fallen
women
are
the
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
Magdalen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
drop
that
!
Christ
would
never
have
said
those
words
if
He

known
*NL*
how
they
would
be
abused
.
Of
all
the
Gospel
those
words
are
the
only
*NL*
ones
remembered
.
However
,
I
'm
not
saying
so
much
what
I
think
,
as
what
I
*NL*
feel

I
have
a
loathing
for
fallen
women

You
're
afraid
of
spiders

and
*NL*
I
of
these
vermin

Most
likely
you
've
not
made
a
study
of
spiders

*NL*
do

their
character

and
so
it
is
with
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well
for
you
to
talk
like
that
;
it
's
very
much
like
that
*NL*
gentleman
in
Dickens
who
used
to
fling
all
difficult
questions
over
his
*NL*
right
shoulder

But
to
deny
the
facts
is
no
answer

What
's
to

done

you
tell
me
that

what
's

Your

gets
older

up

Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
said
with
weary
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
half
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
're
done
for

resumed
Oblonsky
.
``
But
what
's
to
be
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
steal
rolls

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
laughed
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
moralist
!
But
you
must
understand
,
there
are
two
women
;
one
insists
*NL*
only
on
her
rights
,
and
those
rights
are
your
love
,
which
you
ca
n't
give
*NL*
her
;
and
the
other
sacrifices
everything
for
you
and
asks
for
nothing
.
*NL*
What
are
you
to
do
?
How
are
you
to
act
?
There
's
a
fearful
tragedy
in
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
care
for
my
profession
of
faith
as
regards
that
,
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
believe
there
was
any
tragedy
about
it
.
And
this
is
why
.
To
*NL*
my
mind
,
love
...
both
the
sorts
of
love
,
which
you
remember
Plato
*NL*
defines
in
his
Banquet
,
served
as
the
test
of
men
.
Some
men
only
*NL*
understand
one
sort
,
and
some
only
the
other
.
And
those
who
only
know
*NL*
the
non-platonic
love
have
no
need
to
talk
of
tragedy
.
In
such
love
*NL*
there
can
be
no
sort
of
tragedy
.
`
I
'm
much
obliged
for
the
*NL*
gratification
,
my
humble
respects
'
--
that
's
all
the
tragedy
.
And
in
*NL*
platonic
love
there
can
be
no
tragedy
,
because
in
that
love
all
is
clear
*NL*
and
pure
,
because

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Levin
recollected
his
own
sins
and
the
inner
conflict
he
*NL*
had
lived
through
.
And
he
added
unexpectedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
you
are
right
.
Very
likely
...
I
do
n't
know
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
this
,
do
n't
you
see

''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
``
you
're
very
much
*NL*
all
of
a
piece

That
's
your
strong
point
and
your
failing
.
You
have
a
*NL*
character
that
's
all
of
a
piece
,
and
you
want
the
whole
of
life
to
be
of
*NL*
a
piece
too
--
but
that
's
not
how
it
is
.
You
despise
public
official
work
*NL*
because
you
want
the
reality
to
be
invariably
corresponding
all
the
*NL*
while
with
the
aim

that
's
not

it

work

too

always
to
have
a
defined
aim

and
love
and
family
life
always
to
be
*NL*
undivided

and
that
's
not
how
it
is

All
the
variety

all
the
charm

all
*NL*
the
beauty
of
life
is
made
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
sighed
and
made
no
reply
.
He
was
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
,
and
*NL*
did
not
hear
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
both
of
them
felt
that
though
they
were
friends
,
though
*NL*
they
had
been
dining
and
drinking
together
,
which
should
have
drawn
them
*NL*
closer
,
yet
each
was
thinking
only
of
his
own
affairs
,
and
they
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
.
Oblonsky
had
more
than
once
experienced
*NL*
this
extreme
sense
of
aloofness
,
instead
of
intimacy
,
coming
on
after
*NL*
dinner
,
and
he
knew
what
to
do
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bill
!
''
he
called
,
and
he
went
into
the
next
room
where
he
promptly
came
*NL*
across
an
aide-de-camp
of
his
acquaintance
and
dropped
into
conversation
*NL*
with
him
about
an
actress
and
her
protector
.
And
at
once
in
the
*NL*
conversation
with
the
aide-de-camp
Oblonsky
had
a
sense
of
relaxation
*NL*
and
relief
after
the
conversation
with
Levin
,
which
always
put
him
to
*NL*
too
great
a
mental
and
spiritual
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Tatar
appeared
with
a
bill
for
twenty-six
roubles
and
odd
*NL*
kopecks
,
besides
a
tip
for
himself
,
Levin
,
who
would
another
time
have
*NL*
been
horrified
,
like
any
one
from
the
country
,
at
his
share
of
fourteen
*NL*
roubles
,
did
not
notice
it
,
paid
,
and
set
off
homewards
to
dress
and
go
*NL*
to
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
there
to
decide
his
fate
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
12
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Princess
Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya
was
eighteen
.
It
was
the
first
*NL*
winter
that
she
had
been
out
in
the
world
.
Her
success
in
society
had
*NL*
been
greater
than
that
of
either
of
her
elder
sisters
,
and
greater
even
*NL*
than
her
mother
had
anticipated
.
To
say
nothing
of
the
young
men
who
*NL*
danced
at
the
Moscow
balls
being
almost
all
in
love
with
Kitty
,
two
*NL*
serious
suitors
had
already
this
first
winter
made
their
appearance
:
*NL*
Levin
,
and
immediately
after
his
departure
,
Count
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
's
appearance
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
,
his
frequent
visits
,
*NL*
and
evident
love
for
Kitty
,
had
led
to
the
first
serious
conversations
*NL*
between
Kitty
's
parents
as
to
her
future
,
and
to
disputes
between
them
.
*NL*
The
prince
was
on
Levin
's
side
;
he
said
he
wished
for
nothing
better
for
*NL*
Kitty
.
The
princess
for
her
part
,
going
round
the
question
in
the
manner
*NL*
peculiar
to
women
,
maintained
that
Kitty
was
too
young
,
that
Levin
had
*NL*
done
nothing
to
prove
that
he
had
serious
intentions
,
that
Kitty
felt
no
*NL*
great
attraction
to
him
,
and
other
side
issues
;
but
she
did
not
state
*NL*
the
principal
point
,
which
was
that
she
looked
for
a
better
match
for
*NL*
her
daughter
,
and
that
Levin
was
not
to
her
liking
,
and
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
him
.
When
Levin
had
abruptly
departed
,
the
princess
was
*NL*
delighted
,
and
said
to
her
husband
triumphantly
:
``
You
see
I
was
right
.
''
*NL*
When
Vronsky
appeared
on
the
scene
,
she
was
still
more
delighted
,
*NL*
confirmed
in
her
opinion
that
Kitty
was
to
make
not
simply
a
good
,
but
a
*NL*
brilliant
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mother
's
eyes
there
could
be
no
comparison
between
Vronsky
and
*NL*
Levin
.
She
disliked
in
Levin
his
strange
and
uncompromising
opinions
and
*NL*
his
shyness
in
society
,
founded
,
as
she
supposed
,
on
his
pride
and
his
*NL*
queer
sort
of
life
,
as
she
considered
it
,
absorbed
in
cattle
and
*NL*
peasants
.
She
did
not
very
much
like
it
that
he
,
who
was
in
love
with
*NL*
her
daughter
,
had
kept
coming
to
the
house
for
six
weeks
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
waiting
for
something
,
inspecting
,
as
though
he
were
afraid
he
*NL*
might
be
doing
them
too
great
an
honor
by
making
an
offer
,
and
did
not
*NL*
realize
that
a
man
,
who
continually
visits
at
a
house
where
there
is
a
*NL*
young
unmarried
girl
,
is
bound
to
make
his
intentions
clear
.
And
*NL*
suddenly
,
without
doing
so
,
he
disappeared
.
``
It
's
as
well
he
's
not
*NL*
attractive
enough
for
Kitty
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
,
''
thought
*NL*
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
satisfied
all
the
mother
's
desires
.
Very
wealthy
,
clever
,
of
*NL*
aristocratic
family
,
on
the
highroad
to
a
brilliant
career
in
the
army
*NL*
and
at
court
,
and
a
fascinating
man
.
Nothing
better
could
be
wished
for
.

Vronsky
openly
flirted
with
Kitty
at
balls
,
danced
with
her
,
and
came
*NL*
continually
to
the
house
,
consequently
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
*NL*
seriousness
of
his
intentions
.
But
,
in
spite
of
that
,
the
mother
had
*NL*
spent
the
whole
of
that
winter
in
a
state
of
terrible
anxiety
and
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
had
herself
been
married
thirty
years
ago
,
her
*NL*
aunt
arranging
the
match
.
Her
husband
,
about
whom
everything
was
well
*NL*
known
before
hand
,
had
come
,
looked
at
his
future
bride
,
and
been
looked
*NL*
at
.
The
match-making
aunt
had
ascertained
and
communicated
their
mutual
*NL*
impression
.
That
impression
had
been
favorable
.
Afterwards
,
on
a
day
*NL*
fixed
beforehand
,
the
expected
offer
was
made
to
her
parents
,
and
*NL*
accepted
.
All
had
passed
very
simply
and
easily
.
So
it
seemed
,
at
least
,
*NL*
to
the
princess
.
But
over
her
own
daughters
she
had
felt
how
far
from
*NL*
simple
and
easy
is
the
business
,
apparently
so
commonplace
,
of
marrying
*NL*
off
one
's
daughters
.
The
panics
that
had
been
lived
through
,
the
*NL*
thoughts
that
had
been
brooded
over
,
the
money
that
had
been
wasted
,
and
*NL*
the
disputes
with
her
husband
over
marrying
the
two
elder
girls
,
Darya
*NL*
and
Natalia
!
Now
,
since
the
youngest
had
come
out
,
she
was
going
through
*NL*
the
same
terrors
,
the
same
doubts
,
and
still
more
violent
quarrels
with
*NL*
her
husband
than
she
had
over
the
elder
girls
.
The
old
prince
,
like
all
*NL*
fathers
indeed
,
was
exceedingly
punctilious
on
the
score
of
the
honor
*NL*
and
reputation
of
his
daughters
.
He
was
irrationally
jealous
over
his
*NL*
daughters
,
especially
over
Kitty
,
who
was
his
favorite
.
At
every
turn
he
*NL*
had
scenes
with
the
princess
for
compromising
her
daughter
.
The
princess
*NL*
had
grown
accustomed
to
this
already
with
her
other
daughters
,
but
now
*NL*
she
felt
that
there
was
more
ground
for
the
prince
's
touchiness
.
She
saw
*NL*
that
of
late
years
much
was
changed
in
the
manners
of
society
,
that
a
*NL*
mother
's
duties
had
become
still
more
difficult
.
She
saw
that
girls
of
*NL*
Kitty
's
age
formed
some
sort
of
clubs
,
went
to
some
sort
of
lectures
,
*NL*
mixed
freely
in
men
's
society
;
drove
about
the
streets
alone
,
many
of
*NL*
them
did
not
curtsey
,
and
,
what
was
the
most
important
thing
,
all
the
*NL*
girls
were
firmly
convinced
that
to
choose
their
husbands
was
their
own
*NL*
affair
,
and
not
their
parents
'
.
``
Marriages
are
n't
made
nowadays
as
they
*NL*
used
to
be
,
''
was
thought
and
said
by
all
these
young
girls
,
and
even
by
*NL*
their
elders
.
But
how
marriages
were
made
now
,
the
princess
could
not
*NL*
learn
from
any
one
.
The
French
fashion
--
of
the
parents
arranging
their
*NL*
children
's
future
--
was
not
accepted
;
it
was
condemned
.
The
English
*NL*
fashion
of
the
complete
independence
of
girls
was
also
not
accepted
,
and
*NL*
not
possible
in
Russian
society
.
The
Russian
fashion
of
match-making
by
*NL*
the
offices
of
intermediate
persons
was
for
some
reason
considered
*NL*
unseemly
;
it
was
ridiculed
by
every
one
,
and
by
the
princess
herself
.
*NL*
But
how
girls
were
to
be
married
,
and
how
parents
were
to
marry
them
,
no
*NL*
one
knew
.
Everyone
with
whom
the
princess
had
chanced
to
discuss
the
*NL*
matter
said
the
same
thing
:
``
Mercy
on
us
,
it
's
high
time
in
our
day
to
*NL*
cast
off
all
that
old-fashioned
business
.
It
's
the
young
people
have
to
*NL*
marry
;
and
not
their
parents
;
and
so
we
ought
to
leave
the
young
people
*NL*
to
arrange
it
as
they
choose
.
''
It
was
very
easy
for
anyone
to
say
that
*NL*
who
had
no
daughters
,
but
the
princess
realized
that
in
the
process
of
*NL*
getting
to
know
each
other
,
her
daughter
might
fall
in
love
,
and
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
someone
who
did
not
care
to
marry
her
or
who
was
quite
unfit
*NL*
to
be
her
husband
.
And
,
however
much
it
was
instilled
into
the
princess
*NL*
that
in
our
times
young
people
ought
to
arrange
their
lives
for
*NL*
themselves
,
she
was
unable
to
believe
it
,
just
as
she
would
have
been
*NL*
unable
to
believe
that
,
at
any
time
whatever
,
the
most
suitable
*NL*
playthings
for
children
five
years
old
ought
to
be
loaded
pistols
.
And
*NL*
so
the
princess
was
more
uneasy
over
Kitty
than
she
had
been
over
her
*NL*
elder
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
was
afraid
that
Vronsky
might
confine
himself
to
simply
flirting
*NL*
with
her
daughter
.
She
saw
that
her
daughter
was
in
love
with
him
,
but
*NL*
tried
to
comfort
herself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
an
honorable
man
,
*NL*
and
would
not
do
this
.
But
at
the
same
time
she
knew
how
easy
it
is
,
*NL*
with
the
freedom
of
manners
of
today
,
to
turn
a
girl
's
head
,
and
how
*NL*
lightly
men
generally
regard
such
a
crime
.
The
week
before
,
Kitty
had
*NL*
told
her
mother
of
a
conversation
she
had
with
Vronsky
during
a
mazurka
.
*NL*
This
conversation
had
partly
reassured
the
princess
;
but
perfectly
at
*NL*
ease
she
could
not
be
.
Vronsky
had
told
Kitty
that
both
he
and
his
*NL*
brother
were
so
used
to
obeying
their
mother
that
they
never
made
up
*NL*
their
minds
to
any
important
undertaking
without
consulting
her
.
``
And
*NL*
just
now
,
I
am
impatiently
awaiting
my
mother
's
arrival
from
Petersburg
,
*NL*
as
peculiarly
fortunate
,
''
he
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
had
repeated
this
without
attaching
any
significance
to
the
words
.
*NL*
But
her
mother
saw
them
in
a
different
light
.
She
knew
that
the
old
lady
*NL*
was
expected
from
day
to
day
,
that
she
would
be
pleased
at
her
son
's
*NL*
choice
,
and
she
felt
it
strange
that
he
should
not
make
his
offer
*NL*
through
fear
of
vexing
his
mother
.
However
,
she
was
so
anxious
for
the
*NL*
marriage
itself
,
and
still
more
for
relief
from
her
fears
,
that
she
*NL*
believed
it
was
so
.
Bitter
as
it
was
for
the
princess
to
see
the
*NL*
unhappiness
of
her
eldest
daughter
,
Dolly
,
on
the
point
of
leaving
her
*NL*
husband
,
her
anxiety
over
the
decision
of
her
youngest
daughter
's
fate
*NL*
engrossed
all
her
feelings
.
Today
,
with
Levin
's
reappearance
,
a
fresh
*NL*
source
of
anxiety
arose
.
She
was
afraid
that
her
daughter
,
who
had
at
*NL*
one
time
,
as
she
fancied
,
a
feeling
for
Levin
,
might
,
from
extreme
sense
*NL*
of
honor
,
refuse
Vronsky
,
and
that
Levin
's
arrival
might
generally
*NL*
complicate
and
delay
the
affair
so
near
being
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
has
he
been
here
long
?
''
the
princess
asked
about
Levin
,
as
they
*NL*
returned
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
today
,
mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
I
want
to
say
...
''
began
the
princess
,
and
from
her
*NL*
serious
and
alert
face
,
Kitty
guessed
what
it
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
she
said
,
flushing
hotly
and
turning
quickly
to
her
,
``
please
,
*NL*
please
do
n't
say
anything
about
that
.
I
know
,
I
know
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wished
for
what
her
mother
wished
for
,
but
the
motives
of
her
*NL*
mother
's
wishes
wounded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
want
to
say
that
to
raise
hopes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
darling
,
for
goodness
'
sake
,
do
n't
talk
about
it
.
It
's
so
*NL*
horrible
to
talk
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
her
mother
,
seeing
the
tears
in
her
daughter
's
eyes
;
*NL*
``
but
one
thing
,
my
love
;
you
promised
me
you
would
have
no
secrets
from
*NL*
me
.
You
wo
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
mamma
,
none
,
''
answered
Kitty
,
flushing
a
little
,
and
looking
her
*NL*
mother
straight
in
the
face
,
``
but
there
's
no
use
in
my
telling
you
*NL*
anything
,
and
I
...
I
...
if
I
wanted
to
,
I
do
n't
know
what
to
say
or
*NL*
how
...
I
do
n't
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
could
not
tell
an
untruth
with
those
eyes
,
''
thought
the
mother
,
*NL*
smiling
at
her
agitation
and
happiness
.
The
princess
smiled
that
what
*NL*
was
taking
place
just
now
in
her
soul
seemed
to
the
poor
child
so
*NL*
immense
and
so
important
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
and
till
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
Kitty
was
feeling
a
*NL*
sensation
akin
to
the
sensation
of
a
young
man
before
a
battle
.
Her
*NL*
heart
throbbed
violently
,
and
her
thoughts
would
not
rest
on
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
that
this
evening
,
when
they
would
both
meet
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
would
be
a
turning
point
in
her
life
.
And
she
was
continually
*NL*
picturing
them
to
herself
,
at
one
moment
each
separately
,
and
then
both
*NL*
together
.
When
she
mused
on
the
past
,
she
dwelt
with
pleasure
,
with
*NL*
tenderness
,
on
the
memories
of
her
relations
with
Levin
.
The
memories
of
*NL*
childhood
and
of
Levin
's
friendship
with
her
dead
brother
gave
a
special
*NL*
poetic
charm
to
her
relations
with
him
.
His
love
for
her
,
of
which
she
*NL*
felt
certain
,
was
flattering
and
delightful
to
her
;
and
it
was
pleasant
*NL*
for
her
to
think
of
Levin
.
In
her
memories
of
Vronsky
there
always
*NL*
entered
a
certain
element
of
awkwardness
,
though
he
was
in
the
highest
*NL*
degree
well-bred
and
at
ease
,
as
though
there
were
some
false
note
--
not
*NL*
in
Vronsky
,
he
was
very
simple
and
nice
,
but
in
herself
,
while
with
*NL*
Levin
she
felt
perfectly
simple
and
clear
.
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
directly
she
thought
of
the
future
with
Vronsky
,
there
arose
before
her
*NL*
a
perspective
of
brilliant
happiness
;
with
Levin
the
future
seemed
*NL*
misty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
upstairs
to
dress
,
and
looked
into
the
looking-glass
,
she
*NL*
noticed
with
joy
that
it
was
one
of
her
good
days
,
and
that
she
was
in
*NL*
complete
possession
of
all
her
forces
,
--
she
needed
this
so
for
what
lay
*NL*
before
her
:
she
was
conscious
of
external
composure
and
free
grace
in
*NL*
her
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
seven
she
had
only
just
gone
down
into
the
drawing
room
,
*NL*
when
the
footman
announced
,
``
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
Levin
.
''
The
*NL*
princess
was
still
in
her
room
,
and
the
prince
had
not
come
in
.
``
So
it
*NL*
is
to
be
,
''
thought
Kitty
,
and
all
the
blood
seemed
to
rush
to
her
heart
.
*NL*
She
was
horrified
at
her
paleness
,
as
she
glanced
into
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
At
that
moment
she
knew
beyond
doubt
that
he
had
come
*NL*
early
on
purpose
to
find
her
alone
and
to
make
her
an
offer
.
And
only
*NL*
then
for
the
first
time
the
whole
thing
presented
itself
in
a
new
,
*NL*
different
aspect
;
only
then
she
realized
that
the
question
did
not
*NL*
affect
her
only
--
with
whom
she
would
be
happy
,
and
whom
she
loved
--
but
*NL*
that
she
would
have
that
moment
to
wound
a
man
whom
she
liked
.
And
to
*NL*
wound
him
cruelly
.
What
for
?
Because
he
,
dear
fellow
,
loved
her
,
was
in
*NL*
love
with
her
.
But
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
so
it
must
be
,
so
it
would
*NL*
have
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
shall
I
myself
really
have
to
say
it
to
him
?
''
she
thought
.
``
Can
*NL*
I
tell
him
I
do
n't
love
him
?
That
will
be
a
lie
.
What
am
I
to
say
to
*NL*
him
?
That
I
love
someone
else
?
No
,
that
's
impossible
.
I
'm
going
away
,
*NL*
I
'm
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reached
the
door
,
when
she
heard
his
step
.
``
No
!
it
's
not
honest
.
*NL*
What
have
I
to
be
afraid
of
?
I
have
done
nothing
wrong
.
What
is
to
be
,
*NL*
will
be
!
I
'll
tell
the
truth
.
And
with
him
one
ca
n't
be
ill
at
ease
.
*NL*
Here
he
is
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
seeing
his
powerful
,
shy
figure
,
with
*NL*
his
shining
eyes
fixed
on
her
.
She
looked
straight
into
his
face
,
as
*NL*
though
imploring
him
to
spare
her
,
and
gave
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
time
yet
;
I
think
I
'm
too
early
,
''
he
said
glancing
round
the
*NL*
empty
drawing
room
.
When
he
saw
that
his
expectations
were
realized
,
*NL*
that
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
speaking
,
his
face
became
*NL*
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Kitty
,
and
sat
down
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
was
just
what
I
wanted
,
to
find
you
alone
,
''
he
began
,
not
*NL*
sitting
down
,
and
not
looking
at
her
,
so
as
not
to
lose
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
will
be
down
directly
.
She
was
very
much
tired
...
Yesterday
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
talked
on
,
not
knowing
what
her
lips
were
uttering
,
and
not
taking
*NL*
her
supplicating
and
caressing
eyes
off
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
;
she
blushed
,
and
ceased
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
I
did
not
know
whether
I
should
be
here
long
...
that
it
*NL*
depended
on
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
head
lower
and
lower
,
not
knowing
herself
what
answer
*NL*
she
should
make
to
what
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
depended
on
you
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
I
meant
to
say
...
I
meant
to
*NL*
say
...
I
came
for
this
...
to
be
my
wife
!
''
he
brought
out
,
not
knowing
*NL*
what
he
was
saying
;
but
feeling
that
the
most
terrible
thing
was
said
,
*NL*
he
stopped
short
and
looked
at
her
...
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
breathing
heavily
,
not
looking
at
him
.
She
was
feeling
ecstasy
.
*NL*
Her
soul
was
flooded
with
happiness
.
She
had
never
anticipated
that
the
*NL*
utterance
of
love
would
produce
such
a
powerful
effect
on
her
.
But
it
*NL*
lasted
only
an
instant
.
She
remembered
Vronsky
.
She
lifted
her
clear
,
*NL*
truthful
eyes
,
and
seeing
his
desperate
face
,
she
answered
hastily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
...
forgive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
ago
,
and
how
close
she
had
been
to
him
,
of
what
importance
in
*NL*
his
life
!
And
how
aloof
and
remote
from
him
she
had
become
now
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
bound
to
be
so
,
''
he
said
,
not
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
,
and
was
meaning
to
retreat
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
very
moment
the
princess
came
in
.
There
was
a
look
of
horror
*NL*
on
her
face
when
she
saw
them
alone
,
and
their
disturbed
faces
.
Levin
*NL*
bowed
to
her
,
and
said
nothing
.
Kitty
did
not
speak
nor
lift
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
she
has
refused
him
,
''
thought
the
mother
,
and
her
face
*NL*
lighted
up
with
the
habitual
smile
with
which
she
greeted
her
guests
on
*NL*
Thursdays
.
She
sat
down
and
began
questioning
Levin
about
his
life
in
*NL*
the
country
.
He
sat
down
again
,
waiting
for
other
visitors
to
arrive
,
in
*NL*
order
to
retreat
unnoticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
there
came
in
a
friend
of
Kitty
's
,
married
the
*NL*
preceding
winter
,
Countess
Nordston
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
thin
,
sallow
,
sickly
,
and
nervous
woman
,
with
brilliant
black
*NL*
eyes
.
She
was
fond
of
Kitty
,
and
her
affection
for
her
showed
itself
,
as
*NL*
the
affection
of
married
women
for
girls
always
does
,
in
the
desire
to
*NL*
make
a
match
for
Kitty
after
her
own
ideal
of
married
happiness
;
she
*NL*
wanted
her
to
marry
Vronsky
.
Levin
she
had
often
met
at
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
early
in
the
winter
,
and
she
had
always
disliked
him
.
*NL*
Her
invariable
and
favorite
pursuit
,
when
they
met
,
consisted
in
making
*NL*
fun
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
like
it
when
he
looks
down
at
me
from
the
height
of
his
grandeur
,
*NL*
or
breaks
off
his
learned
conversation
with
me
because
I
'm
a
fool
,
or
is
*NL*
condescending
to
me
.
I
like
that
so
;
to
see
him
condescending
!
I
am
so
*NL*
glad
he
ca
n't
bear
me
,
''
she
used
to
say
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
right
,
for
Levin
actually
could
not
bear
her
,
and
despised
her
*NL*
for
what
she
was
proud
of
and
regarded
as
a
fine
characteristic
--
her
*NL*
nervousness
,
her
delicate
contempt
and
indifference
for
everything
*NL*
coarse
and
earthly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Nordston
and
Levin
got
into
that
relation
with
one
another
*NL*
not
seldom
seen
in
society
,
when
two
persons
,
who
remain
externally
on
*NL*
friendly
terms
,
despise
each
other
to
such
a
degree
that
they
can
not
*NL*
even
take
each
other
seriously
,
and
can
not
even
be
offended
by
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Nordston
pounced
upon
Levin
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
!
So
you
've
come
back
to
our
corrupt
*NL*
Babylon
,
''
she
said
,
giving
him
her
tiny
,
yellow
hand
,
and
recalling
what
*NL*
he
had
chanced
to
say
early
in
the
winter
,
that
Moscow
was
a
Babylon
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
is
Babylon
reformed
,
or
have
you
degenerated
?
''
she
added
,
*NL*
glancing
with
a
simper
at
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
flattering
for
me
,
countess
,
that
you
remember
my
words
so
*NL*
well
,
''
responded
Levin
,
who
had
succeeded
in
recovering
his
composure
,
*NL*
and
at
once
from
habit
dropped
into
his
tone
of
joking
hostility
to
the
*NL*
Countess
Nordston
.
``
They
must
certainly
make
a
great
impression
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
should
think
so
!
I
always
note
them
all
down
.
Well
,
Kitty
,
have
*NL*
you
been
skating
again
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
talking
to
Kitty
.
Awkward
as
it
was
for
Levin
to
withdraw
*NL*
now
,
it
would
still
have
been
easier
for
him
to
perpetrate
this
*NL*
awkwardness
than
to
remain
all
the
evening
and
see
Kitty
,
who
glanced
at
*NL*
him
now
and
then
and
avoided
his
eyes
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
getting
*NL*
up
,
when
the
princess
,
noticing
that
he
was
silent
,
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
be
long
in
Moscow
?
You
're
busy
with
the
district
council
,
*NL*
though
,
are
n't
you
,
and
ca
n't
be
away
for
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
princess
,
I
'm
no
longer
a
member
of
the
council
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
have
*NL*
come
up
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
the
matter
with
him
,
''
thought
Countess
Nordston
,
*NL*
glancing
at
his
stern
,
serious
face
.
``
He
is
n't
in
his
old
argumentative
*NL*
mood
.
But
I
'll
draw
him
out
.
I
do
love
making
a
fool
of
him
before
*NL*
Kitty
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
do
explain
to
me
,
please
,
*NL*
what
's
the
meaning
of
it
.
You
know
all
about
such
things
.
At
home
in
our
*NL*
village
of
Kaluga
all
the
peasants
and
all
the
women
have
drunk
up
all
*NL*
they
possessed
,
and
now
they
ca
n't
pay
us
any
rent
.
What
's
the
meaning
*NL*
of
that
?
You
always
praise
the
peasants
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
another
lady
came
into
the
room
,
and
Levin
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
countess
,
but
I
really
know
nothing
about
it
,
and
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
you
anything
,
''
he
said
,
and
looked
round
at
the
officer
who
came
in
*NL*
behind
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
Vronsky
,
''
thought
Levin
,
and
,
to
be
sure
of
it
,
glanced
at
*NL*
Kitty
.
She
had
already
had
time
to
look
at
Vronsky
,
and
looked
round
at
*NL*
Levin
.
And
simply
from
the
look
in
her
eyes
,
that
grew
unconsciously
*NL*
brighter
,
Levin
knew
that
she
loved
that
man
,
knew
it
as
surely
as
if
*NL*
she
had
told
him
so
in
words
.
But
what
sort
of
a
man
was
he
?
Now
,
*NL*
whether
for
good
or
for
ill
,
Levin
could
not
choose
but
remain
;
he
must
*NL*
find
out
what
the
man
was
like
whom
she
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
people
who
,
on
meeting
a
successful
rival
,
no
matter
in
what
,
*NL*
are
at
once
disposed
to
turn
their
backs
on
everything
good
in
him
,
and
*NL*
to
see
only
what
is
bad
.
There
are
people
,
on
the
other
hand
,
who
desire
*NL*
above
all
to
find
in
that
lucky
rival
the
qualities
by
which
he
has
*NL*
outstripped
them
,
and
seek
with
a
throbbing
ache
at
heart
only
what
is
*NL*
good
.
Levin
belonged
to
the
second
class
.
But
he
had
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
finding
what
was
good
and
attractive
in
Vronsky
.
It
was
apparent
at
the
*NL*
first
glance
.
Vronsky
was
a
squarely
built
,
dark
man
,
not
very
tall
,
*NL*
with
a
good-humored
,
handsome
,
and
exceedingly
calm
and
resolute
face
.
*NL*
Everything
about
his
face
and
figure
,
from
his
short-cropped
black
hair
*NL*
and
freshly
shaven
chin
down
to
his
loosely
fitting
,
brand-new
uniform
,
*NL*
was
simple
and
at
the
same
time
elegant
.
Making
way
for
the
lady
who
had
*NL*
come
in
,
Vronsky
went
up
to
the
princess
and
then
to
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
her
,
his
beautiful
eyes
shone
with
a
specially
tender
*NL*
light
,
and
with
a
faint
,
happy
,
and
modestly
triumphant
smile
-LRB-
so
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Levin
-RRB-
,
bowing
carefully
and
respectfully
over
her
,
he
held
*NL*
out
his
small
broad
hand
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Greeting
and
saying
a
few
words
to
everyone
,
he
sat
down
without
once
*NL*
glancing
at
Levin
,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
introduce
you
,
''
said
the
princess
,
indicating
Levin
.
``
Konstantin
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
Levin
,
Count
Alexey
Kirillovitch
Vronsky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
got
up
and
,
looking
cordially
at
Levin
,
shook
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
was
to
have
dined
with
you
this
winter
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
*NL*
his
simple
and
open
smile
;
``
but
you
had
unexpectedly
left
for
the
*NL*
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
despises
and
hates
town
and
us
townspeople
,
''
*NL*
said
Countess
Nordston
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
words
must
make
a
deep
impression
on
you
,
since
you
remember
them
so
*NL*
well
,
''
said
Levin
,
and
,
suddenly
conscious
that
he
had
said
just
the
*NL*
same
thing
before
,
he
reddened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
looked
at
Levin
and
Countess
Nordston
,
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
always
in
the
country
?
''
he
inquired
.
``
I
should
think
it
must
be
*NL*
dull
in
the
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
dull
if
one
has
work
to
do
;
besides
,
one
's
not
dull
by
*NL*
oneself
,
''
Levin
replied
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fond
of
the
country
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
noticing
,
and
affecting
not
to
*NL*
notice
,
Levin
's
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
hope
,
count
,
you
would
not
consent
to
live
in
the
country
*NL*
always
,
''
said
Countess
Nordston
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
have
never
tried
for
long
.
I
experienced
a
queer
*NL*
feeling
once
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
never
longed
so
for
the
country
,
Russian
*NL*
country
,
with
bast
shoes
and
peasants
,
as
when
I
was
spending
a
winter
*NL*
with
my
mother
in
Nice
.
Nice
itself
is
dull
enough
,
you
know
.
And
*NL*
indeed
,
Naples
and
Sorrento
are
only
pleasant
for
a
short
time
.
And
it
's
*NL*
just
there
that
Russia
comes
back
to
me
most
vividly
,
and
especially
the
*NL*
country
.
It
's
as
though
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
on
,
addressing
both
Kitty
and
Levin
,
turning
his
serene
,
*NL*
friendly
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
saying
obviously
just
what
came
*NL*
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
that
Countess
Nordston
wanted
to
say
something
,
he
stopped
*NL*
short
without
finishing
what
he
had
begun
,
and
listened
attentively
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
did
not
flag
for
an
instant
,
so
that
the
princess
,
who
*NL*
always
kept
in
reserve
,
in
case
a
subject
should
be
lacking
,
two
heavy
*NL*
guns
--
the
relative
advantages
of
classical
and
of
modern
education
,
and
*NL*
universal
military
service
--
had
not
to
move
out
either
of
them
,
while
*NL*
Countess
Nordston
had
not
a
chance
of
chaffing
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
wanted
to
,
and
could
not
,
take
part
in
the
general
conversation
;
*NL*
saying
to
himself
every
instant
,
``
Now
go
,
''
he
still
did
not
go
,
as
*NL*
though
waiting
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
fell
upon
table-turning
and
spirits
,
and
Countess
*NL*
Nordston
,
who
believed
in
spiritualism
,
began
to
describe
the
marvels
*NL*
she
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
countess
,
you
really
must
take
me
,
for
pity
's
sake
do
take
me
to
*NL*
see
them
!
I
have
never
seen
anything
extraordinary
,
though
I
am
always
*NL*
on
the
lookout
for
it
everywhere
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
next
Saturday
,
''
answered
Countess
Nordston
.
``
But
you
,
*NL*
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
do
you
believe
in
it
?
''
she
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
You
know
what
I
shall
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
to
hear
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion
,
''
answered
Levin
,
``
is
only
that
this
table-turning
simply
*NL*
proves
that
educated
society
--
so
called
--
is
no
higher
than
the
peasants
.
*NL*
They
believe
in
the
evil
eye
,
and
in
witchcraft
and
omens
,
while
we
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
you
do
n't
believe
in
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
believe
in
it
,
countess

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
've
seen
it
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
peasant
women
too
tell
us
they
have
seen
goblins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
think
I
tell
a
lie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
laughed
a
mirthless
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Masha
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
said
he
could
not
believe
in
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Kitty
,
blushing
for
Levin
,
and
Levin
saw
this
,
and
,
still
more
*NL*
exasperated
,
would
have
answered
,
but
Vronsky
with
his
bright
frank
*NL*
smile
rushed
to
the
support
of
the
conversation
,
which
was
threatening
*NL*
to
become
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
admit
the
conceivability
at
all
?
''
he
queried
.
``
But
why
not
?
*NL*
We
admit
the
existence
of
electricity
,
of
which
we
know
nothing

Why
*NL*
should
there
not
be
some
new
force

still
unknown
to
us
,
which

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
electricity
was
discovered
,
''
Levin
interrupted
hurriedly
,
``
it
was
*NL*
only
the
phenomenon
that
was
discovered
,
and
it
was
unknown
from
what
it
*NL*
proceeded
and
what
were
its
effects
,
and
ages
passed
before
its
*NL*
applications
were
conceived
.
But
the
spiritualists
have
begun
with
*NL*
tables
writing
for
them
,
and
spirits
appearing
to
them
,
and
have
only
*NL*
later
started
saying
that
it
is
an
unknown
force
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
listened
attentively
to
Levin
,
as
he
always
did
listen
,
*NL*
obviously
interested
in
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
spiritualists
say
we
do
n't
know
at
present
what
this
force
*NL*
is
,
but
there
is
a
force
,
and
these
are
the
conditions
in
which
it
acts
.
*NL*
Let
the
scientific
men
find
out
what
the
force
consists
in

No
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
why
there
should
not
be
a
new
force
,
if
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
because
with
electricity
,
''
Levin
interrupted
again
,
``
every
time
*NL*
you
rub
tar
against
wool
,
a
recognized
phenomenon
is
manifested
,
but
in
*NL*
this
case
it
does
not
happen
every
time
,
and
so
it
follows
it
is
not
a
*NL*
natural
phenomenon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
probably
that
the
conversation
was
taking
a
tone
too
serious
for
*NL*
a
drawing
room
,
Vronsky
made
no
rejoinder
,
but
by
way
of
trying
to
*NL*
change
the
conversation
,
he
smiled
brightly
,
and
turned
to
the
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
let
us
try
at
once
,
countess
,
''
he
said
;
but
Levin
would
finish
*NL*
saying
what
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
this
attempt
of
the
spiritualists
to
*NL*
explain
their
marvels
as
some
sort
of
new
natural
force
is
most
futile
.
*NL*
They
boldly
talk
of
spiritual
force
,
and
then
try
to
subject
it
to
*NL*
material
experiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
was
waiting
for
him
to
finish
,
and
he
felt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
think
you
would
be
a
first-rate
medium
,
''
said
Countess
Nordston
;
*NL*
``
there
's
something
enthusiastic
in
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
opened
his
mouth
,
was
about
to
say
something
,
reddened
,
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
let
us
try
table-turning
at
once
,
please
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
Princess
,
*NL*
will
you
allow
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Vronsky
stood
up
,
looking
for
a
little
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
got
up
to
fetch
a
table
,
and
as
she
passed
,
her
eyes
met
Levin
's
.
*NL*
She
felt
for
him
with
her
whole
heart
,
the
more
because
she
was
pitying
*NL*
him
for
suffering
of
which
she
was
herself
the
cause
.
``
If
you
can
*NL*
forgive
me
,
forgive
me
,
''
said
her
eyes
,
``
I
am
so
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
them
all
,
and
you
,
and
myself
,
''
his
eyes
responded
,
and
he
took
*NL*
up
his
hat
.
But
he
was
not
destined
to
escape
.
Just
as
they
were
*NL*
arranging
themselves
round
the
table
,
and
Levin
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
retiring
,
the
old
prince
came
in
,
and
after
greeting
the
ladies
,
*NL*
addressed
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
began
joyously
.
``
Been
here
long
,
my
boy
?
I
did
n't
even
know
you
*NL*
were
in
town
.
Very
glad
to
see
you
.
''
The
old
prince
embraced
Levin
,
and
*NL*
talking
to
him
did
not
observe
Vronsky
,
who
had
risen
,
and
was
serenely
*NL*
waiting
till
the
prince
should
turn
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
felt
how
distasteful
her
father
's
warmth
was
to
Levin
after
what
*NL*
had
happened
.
She
saw
,
too
,
how
coldly
her
father
responded
at
last
to
*NL*
Vronsky
's
bow
,
and
how
Vronsky
looked
with
amiable
perplexity
at
her
*NL*
father
,
as
though
trying
and
failing
to
understand
how
and
why
anyone
*NL*
could
be
hostilely
disposed
towards
him
,
and
she
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
let
us
have
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
said
Countess
Nordston
;
*NL*
``
we
want
to
try
an
experiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
experiment
?
Table-turning
?
Well
,
you
must
excuse
me
,
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
,
but
to
my
mind
it
is
better
fun
to
play
the
ring
game
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
prince
,
looking
at
Vronsky
,
and
guessing
that
it
had
been
his
*NL*
suggestion
.
``
There
's
some
sense
in
that
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
looked
wonderingly
at
the
prince
with
his
resolute
eyes
,
and
,
*NL*
with
a
faint
smile
,
began
immediately
talking
to
Countess
Nordston
of
*NL*
the
great
ball
that
was
to
come
off
next
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
be
there
?
''
he
said
to
Kitty
.
As
soon
as
the
old
prince
*NL*
turned
away
from
him
,
Levin
went
out
unnoticed
,
and
the
last
impression
*NL*
he
carried
away
with
him
of
that
evening
was
the
smiling
,
happy
face
of
*NL*
Kitty
answering
Vronsky
's
inquiry
about
the
ball
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
evening
Kitty
told
her
mother
of
her
conversation
with
*NL*
Levin
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
pity
she
felt
for
Levin
,
she
was
glad
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
she
had
received
an
_
offer
_
.
She
had
no
doubt
that
she
*NL*
had
acted
rightly
.
But
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
,
for
a
long
while
she
*NL*
could
not
sleep
.
One
impression
pursued
her
relentlessly
.
It
was
Levin
's
*NL*
face
,
with
his
scowling
brows
,
and
his
kind
eyes
looking
out
in
dark
*NL*
dejection
below
them
,
as
he
stood
listening
to
her
father
,
and
glancing
*NL*
at
her
and
at
Vronsky
.
And
she
felt
so
sorry
for
him
that
tears
came
*NL*
into
her
eyes
.
But
immediately
she
thought
of
the
man
for
whom
she
had
*NL*
given
him
up
.
She
vividly
recalled
his
manly
,
resolute
face
,
his
noble
*NL*
self-possession
,
and
the
good
nature
conspicuous
in
everything
towards
*NL*
everyone
.
She
remembered
the
love
for
her
of
the
man
she
loved
,
and
once
*NL*
more
all
was
gladness
in
her
soul
,
and
she
lay
on
the
pillow
,
smiling
*NL*
with
happiness
.
``
I
'm
sorry
,
I
'm
sorry
;
but
what
could
I
do
?
It
's
not
my
*NL*
fault
,
''
she
said
to
herself
;
but
an
inner
voice
told
her
something
else
.
*NL*
Whether
she
felt
remorse
at
having
won
Levin
's
love
,
or
at
having
*NL*
refused
him
,
she
did
not
know
.
But
her
happiness
was
poisoned
by
doubts
.
*NL*
``
Lord
,
have
pity
on
us
;
Lord
,
have
pity
on
us
;
Lord
,
have
pity
on
us
!
''
*NL*
she
repeated
to
herself
,
till
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
there
took
place
below
,
in
the
prince
's
little
library
,
one
of
*NL*
the
scenes
so
often
repeated
between
the
parents
on
account
of
their
*NL*
favorite
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
I
'll
tell
you
what
!
''
shouted
the
prince
,
waving
his
arms
,
and
at
*NL*
once
wrapping
his
squirrel-lined
dressing-gown
round
him
again
.
``
That
*NL*
you
've
no
pride
,
no
dignity
;
that
you
're
disgracing
,
ruining
your
*NL*
daughter
by
this
vulgar
,
stupid
match-making
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
really
,
for
mercy
's
sake
,
prince
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
,
almost
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
pleased
and
happy
after
her
conversation
with
her
daughter
,
had
*NL*
gone
to
the
prince
to
say
good-night
as
usual
,
and
though
she
had
no
*NL*
intention
of
telling
him
of
Levin
's
offer
and
Kitty
's
refusal
,
still
she
*NL*
hinted
to
her
husband
that
she
fancied
things
were
practically
settled
*NL*
with
Vronsky
,
and
that
he
would
declare
himself
so
soon
as
his
mother
*NL*
arrived
.
And
thereupon
,
at
those
words
,
the
prince
had
all
at
once
flown
*NL*
into
a
passion
,
and
began
to
use
unseemly
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
?
I
'll
tell
you
what
.
First
of
all
,
you
're
trying
to
*NL*
catch
an
eligible
gentleman
,
and
all
Moscow
will
be
talking
of
it
,
and
*NL*
with
good
reason
.
If
you
have
evening
parties
,
invite
everyone
,
do
n't
*NL*
pick
out
the
possible
suitors
.
Invite
all
the
young
bucks
.
Engage
a
*NL*
piano
player
,
and
let
them
dance
,
and
not
as
you
do
things
nowadays
,
*NL*
hunting
up
good
matches
.
It
makes
me
sick
,
sick
to
see
it
,
and
you
've
*NL*
gone
on
till
you
've
turned
the
poor
wench
's
head
.
Levin
's
a
thousand
*NL*
times
the
better
man
.
As
for
this
little
Petersburg
swell
,
they
're
*NL*
turned
out
by
machinery
,
all
on
one
pattern
,
and
all
precious
rubbish
.
*NL*
But
if
he
were
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
my
daughter
need
not
run
after
*NL*
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
've
...
''
The
prince
was
crying
wrathfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
if
one
were
to
listen
to
you
,
''
interrupted
the
princess
,
``
we
*NL*
should
never
marry
our
daughter
.
If
it
's
to
be
so
,
we
'd
better
go
into
*NL*
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
we
had
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
wait
a
minute
.
Do
I
try
and
catch
them
?
I
do
n't
try
to
catch
*NL*
them
in
the
least
.
A
young
man
,
and
a
very
nice
one
,
has
fallen
in
love
*NL*
with
her
,
and
she
,
I
fancy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
you
fancy
!
And
how
if
she
really
is
in
love
,
and
he
's
no
more
*NL*
thinking
of
marriage
than
I
am
!
...
Oh
,
that
I
should
live
to
see
it
!
Ah
!
*NL*
spiritualism
!
Ah
!
Nice
!
Ah
!
the
ball
!
''
And
the
prince
,
imagining
that
he
*NL*
was
mimicking
his
wife
,
made
a
mincing
curtsey
at
each
word
.
``
And
this
*NL*
is
how
we
're
preparing
wretchedness
for
Kitty
;
and
she
's
really
got
the
*NL*
notion
into
her
head
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
makes
you
suppose
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose

I
know

We
have
eyes
for
such
things
,
though
*NL*
women-folk
have
n't
.
I
see
a
man
who
has
serious
intentions
,
that
's
*NL*
Levin
:
and
I
see
a
peacock
,
like
this
feather-head
,
who
's
only
amusing
*NL*
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
when
once
you
get
an
idea
into
your
head
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
remember
my
words
,
but
too
late
,
just
as
with
Dolly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
we
wo
n't
talk
of
it
,
''
the
princess
stopped
him
,
*NL*
recollecting
her
unlucky
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
and
good
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
signing
each
other
with
the
cross
,
the
husband
and
wife
parted
with
*NL*
a
kiss
,
feeling
that
they
each
remained
of
their
own
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
had
at
first
been
quite
certain
that
that
evening
had
*NL*
settled
Kitty
's
future
,
and
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
Vronsky
's
*NL*
intentions
,
but
her
husband
's
words
had
disturbed
her
.
And
returning
to
*NL*
her
own
room
,
in
terror
before
the
unknown
future
,
she
,
too
,
like
Kitty
,
*NL*
repeated
several
times
in
her
heart
,
``
Lord
,
have
pity
;

have
pity

Chapter
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
never
had
a
real
home
life
.
His
mother
had
been
in
her
youth
*NL*
a
brilliant
society
woman
,
who
had
had
during
her
married
life
,
and
*NL*
still
more
afterwards
,
many
love
affairs
notorious
in
the
whole
*NL*
fashionable
world
.
His
father
he
scarcely
remembered
,
and
he
had
been
*NL*
educated
in
the
Corps
of
Pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
school
very
young
as
a
brilliant
officer
,
he
had
at
once
got
*NL*
into
the
circle
of
wealthy
Petersburg
army
men
.
Although
he
did
go
more
*NL*
or
less
into
Petersburg
society
,
his
love
affairs
had
always
hitherto
*NL*
been
outside
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Moscow
he
had
for
the
first
time
felt
,
after
his
luxurious
and
coarse
*NL*
life
at
Petersburg
,
all
the
charm
of
intimacy
with
a
sweet
and
innocent
*NL*
girl
of
his
own
rank
,
who
cared
for
him
.
It
never
even
entered
his
head
*NL*
that
there
could
be
any
harm
in
his
relations
with
Kitty
.
At
balls
he
*NL*
danced
principally
with
her
.
He
was
a
constant
visitor
at
their
house
.
*NL*
He
talked
to
her
as
people
commonly
do
talk
in
society
--
all
sorts
of
*NL*
nonsense
,
but
nonsense
to
which
he
could
not
help
attaching
a
special
*NL*
meaning
in
her
case
.
Although
he
said
nothing
to
her
that
he
could
not
*NL*
have
said
before
everybody
,
he
felt
that
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
*NL*
dependent
upon
him
,
and
the
more
he
felt
this
,
the
better
he
liked
it
,
*NL*
and
the
tenderer
was
his
feeling
for
her
.
He
did
not
know
that
his
mode
*NL*
of
behavior
in
relation
to
Kitty
had
a
definite
character
,
that
it
is
*NL*
courting
young
girls
with
no
intention
of
marriage
,
and
that
such
*NL*
courting
is
one
of
the
evil
actions
common
among
brilliant
young
men
*NL*
such
as
he
was
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
the
first
who
had
*NL*
discovered
this
pleasure
,
and
he
was
enjoying
his
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
could
have
heard
what
her
parents
were
saying
that
evening
,
if
he
*NL*
could
have
put
himself
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
family
and
have
heard
*NL*
that
Kitty
would
be
unhappy
if
he
did
not
marry
her
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
greatly
astonished
,
and
would
not
have
believed
it
.
He
could
not
believe
*NL*
that
what
gave
such
great
and
delicate
pleasure
to
him
,
and
above
all
to
*NL*
her
,
could
be
wrong
.
Still
less
could
he
have
believed
that
he
ought
to
*NL*
marry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marriage
had
never
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
possibility
.
He
not
only
*NL*
disliked
family
life
,
but
a
family
,
and
especially
a
husband
was
,
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
views
general
in
the
bachelor
world
in
which
he
*NL*
lived
,
conceived
as
something
alien
,
repellant
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
ridiculous
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Vronsky
had
not
the
least
suspicion
what
the
parents
were
*NL*
saying
,
he
felt
on
coming
away
from
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
that
the
secret
*NL*
spiritual
bond
which
existed
between
him
and
Kitty
had
grown
so
much
*NL*
stronger
that
evening
that
some
step
must
be
taken
.
But
what
step
could
*NL*
and
ought
to
be
taken
he
could
not
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
so
exquisite
,
''
he
thought
,
as
he
returned
from
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
,
carrying
away
with
him
,
as
he
always
did
,
a
delicious
*NL*
feeling
of
purity
and
freshness
,
arising
partly
from
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
had
not
been
smoking
for
a
whole
evening
,
and
with
it
a
new
feeling
of
*NL*
tenderness
at
her
love
for
him
--
``
what
is
so
exquisite
is
that
not
a
word
*NL*
has
been
said
by
me
or
by
her
,
but
we
understand
each
other
so
well
in
*NL*
this
unseen
language
of
looks
and
tones
,
that
this
evening
more
clearly
*NL*
than
ever
she
told
me
she
loves
me
.
And
how
secretly
,
simply
,
and
most
*NL*
of
all
,
how
trustfully
!
I
feel
myself
better
,
purer
.
I
feel
that
I
have
*NL*
a
heart
,
and
that
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
me
.
Those
sweet
,
*NL*
loving
eyes
!
When
she
said
:
`
Indeed
I
do
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
Oh
,
nothing
.
It
's
good
for
me
,
and
good
for
her
.
''
And
*NL*
he
began
wondering
where
to
finish
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
in
review
of
the
places
he
might
go
to
.
``
Club
?
a
game
of
*NL*
bezique
,
champagne
with
Ignatov
?
No
,
I
'm
not
going
.
_
Chateau
des
*NL*
Fleurs
_
;
there
I
shall
find
Oblonsky
,
songs
,
the
cancan
.
No
,
I
'm
sick
of
*NL*
it
.
That
's
why
I
like
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
,
that
I
'm
growing
better
.
I
'll
*NL*
go
home
.
''
He
went
straight
to
his
room
at
Dussot
's
Hotel
,
ordered
*NL*
supper
,
and
then
undressed
,
and
as
soon
as
his
head
touched
the
pillow
,
*NL*
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
Vronsky
drove
to
the
station
*NL*
of
the
Petersburg
railway
to
meet
his
mother
,
and
the
first
person
he
*NL*
came
across
on
the
great
flight
of
steps
was
Oblonsky
,
who
was
expecting
*NL*
his
sister
by
the
same
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
your
excellency
!
''
cried
Oblonsky
,
``
whom
are
you
meeting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
,
''
Vronsky
responded
,
smiling
,
as
everyone
did
who
met
*NL*
Oblonsky
.
He
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
together
they
ascended
the
steps
.
*NL*
``
She
is
to
be
here
from
Petersburg
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
out
for
you
till
two
o'clock
last
night
.
Where
did
you
go
*NL*
after
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Home
,
''
answered
Vronsky
.
``
I
must
own
I
felt
so
well
content
yesterday
*NL*
after
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
that
I
did
n't
care
to
go
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
gallant
steed
by
tokens
sure
,
*NL*
And
by
his
eyes
I
know
a
youth
in
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
declaimed
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
just
as
he
had
done
before
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
smiled
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
say
that
he
did
not
deny
it
,
*NL*
but
he
promptly
changed
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whom
are
you
meeting
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
've
come
to
meet
a
pretty
woman
,
''
said
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Honi

qui
mal
y

_
My
sister
Anna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
's
Madame
Karenina
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
her
,
no
doubt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
do
.
Or
perhaps
not
...
I
really
am
not
sure
,
''
Vronsky
*NL*
answered
heedlessly
,
with
a
vague
recollection
of
something
stiff
and
*NL*
tedious
evoked
by
the
name
Karenina
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
my
celebrated
brother-in-law
,
you
surely
*NL*
must
know
.
All
the
world
knows
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
him
by
reputation
and
by
sight
.
I
know
that
he
's
clever
,
*NL*
learned
,
religious
somewhat
...
But
you
know
that
's
not
...
_
not
in
my
*NL*
line
,
_
''
said
Vronsky
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
a
very
remarkable
man
;
rather
a
conservative
,
but
a
splendid
*NL*
man
,
''
observed
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
``
a
splendid
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
so
much
the
better
for
him
,
''
said
Vronsky
smiling
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
you
've
come
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
a
tall
old
footman
of
his
mother
's
,
*NL*
standing
at
the
door
;
``
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
charm
Oblonsky
had
in
general
for
everyone
,
Vronsky
had
felt
*NL*
of
late
specially
drawn
to
him
by
the
fact
that
in
his
imagination
he
*NL*
was
associated
with
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
?
Shall
we
give
a
supper
on
Sunday
for
the
*NL*
_
diva
?
_
''
he
said
to
him
with
a
smile
,
taking
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
I
'm
collecting
subscriptions
.
Oh
,
did
you
make
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
my
friend
Levin
?
''
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
he
left
rather
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
capital
fellow
,
''
pursued
Oblonsky
.
``
Is
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
it
is
,
''
responded
Vronsky
,
``
in
all
Moscow
*NL*
people
--
present
company
of
course
excepted
,
''
he
put
in
jestingly
,
*NL*
``
there
's
something
uncompromising
.
They
are
all
on
the
defensive
,
lose
*NL*
their
tempers
,
as
though
they
all
want
to
make
one
feel
something
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
true
,
it
is
so
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
laughing
*NL*
good-humoredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
the
train
soon
be
in
?
''
Vronsky
asked
a
railway
official
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
's
signaled
,
''
answered
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
approach
of
the
train
was
more
and
more
evident
by
the
preparatory
*NL*
bustle
in
the
station
,
the
rush
of
porters
,
the
movement
of
policemen
*NL*
and
attendants
,
and
people
meeting
the
train
.
Through
the
frosty
vapor
*NL*
could
be
seen
workmen
in
short
sheepskins
and
soft
felt
boots
crossing
*NL*
the
rails
of
the
curving
line
.
The
hiss
of
the
boiler
could
be
heard
on
*NL*
the
distant
rails
,
and
the
rumble
of
something
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
felt
a
great
inclination
to
tell
*NL*
Vronsky
of
Levin
's
intentions
in
regard
to
Kitty
.
``
No
,
you
've
not
got
a
*NL*
true
impression
of
Levin
.
He
's
a
very
nervous
man
,
and
is
sometimes
out
*NL*
of
humor
,
it
's
true
,
but
then
he
is
often
very
nice
.
He
's
such
a
true
,
*NL*
honest
nature
,
and
a
heart
of
gold
.
But
yesterday
there
were
special
*NL*
reasons
,
''
pursued
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
a
meaning
smile
,
totally
*NL*
oblivious
of
the
genuine
sympathy
he
had
felt
the
day
before
for
his
*NL*
friend
,
and
feeling
the
same
sympathy
now
,
only
for
Vronsky
.
``
Yes
,
there
*NL*
were
reasons
why
he
could
not
help
being
either
particularly
happy
or
*NL*
particularly
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
stood
still
and
asked
directly
:
``
How
so
?
Do
you
mean
he
made
*NL*
your
_
belle-soeur
_
an
offer
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
I
fancied
something
of
the
sort
*NL*
yesterday
.
Yes
,
if
he
went
away
early
,
and
was
out
of
humor
too
,
it
must
*NL*
mean
it
...
He
's
been
so
long
in
love
,
and
I
'm
very
sorry
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
it
!
I
should
imagine
,
though
,
she
might
reckon
on
a
better
*NL*
match
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
drawing
himself
up
and
walking
about
again
,
*NL*
``
though
I
do
n't
know
him
,
of
course
,
''
he
added
.
``
Yes
,
that
is
a
hateful
*NL*
position
!
That
's
why
most
fellows
prefer
to
have
to
do
with
Klaras
.
If
*NL*
you
do
n't
succeed
with
them
it
only
proves
that
you
've
not
enough
cash
,
*NL*
but
in
this
case
one
's
dignity
's
at
stake
.
But
here
's
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
engine
had
already
whistled
in
the
distance
.
A
few
instants
later
*NL*
the
platform
was
quivering
,
and
with
puffs
of
steam
hanging
low
in
the
*NL*
air
from
the
frost
,
the
engine
rolled
up
,
with
the
lever
of
the
middle
*NL*
wheel
rhythmically
moving
up
and
down
,
and
the
stooping
figure
of
the
*NL*
engine-driver
covered
with
frost
.
Behind
the
tender
,
setting
the
*NL*
platform
more
and
more
slowly
swaying
,
came
the
luggage
van
with
a
dog
*NL*
whining
in
it
.
At
last
the
passenger
carriages
rolled
in
,
oscillating
*NL*
before
coming
to
a
standstill
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
smart
guard
jumped
out
,
giving
a
whistle
,
and
after
him
one
by
one
the
*NL*
impatient
passengers
began
to
get
down
:
an
officer
of
the
guards
,
*NL*
holding
himself
erect
,
and
looking
severely
about
him
;
a
nimble
little
*NL*
merchant
with
a
satchel
,
smiling
gaily
;
a
peasant
with
a
sack
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
standing
beside
Oblonsky
,
watched
the
carriages
and
the
*NL*
passengers
,
totally
oblivious
of
his
mother
.
What
he
had
just
heard
*NL*
about
Kitty
excited
and
delighted
him
.
Unconsciously
he
arched
his
*NL*
chest
,
and
his
eyes
flashed
.
He
felt
himself
a
conqueror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Countess
Vronskaya
is
in
that
compartment
,
''
said
the
smart
guard
,
going
*NL*
up
to
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guard
's
words
roused
him
,
and
forced
him
to
think
of
his
mother
and
*NL*
his
approaching
meeting
with
her
.
He
did
not
in
his
heart
respect
his
*NL*
mother
,
and
without
acknowledging
it
to
himself
,
he
did
not
love
her
,
*NL*
though
in
accordance
with
the
ideas
of
the
set
in
which
he
lived
,
and
*NL*
with
his
own
education
,
he
could
not
have
conceived
of
any
behavior
to
*NL*
his
mother
not
in
the
highest
degree
respectful
and
obedient
,
and
the
*NL*
more
externally
obedient
and
respectful
his
behavior
,
the
less
in
his
*NL*
heart
he
respected
and
loved
her
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
followed
the
guard
to
the
carriage
,
and
at
the
door
of
the
*NL*
compartment
he
stopped
short
to
make
room
for
a
lady
who
was
getting
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
insight
of
a
man
of
the
world
,
from
one
glance
at
this
lady
's
*NL*
appearance
Vronsky
classified
her
as
belonging
to
the
best
society
.
He
*NL*
begged
pardon
,
and
was
getting
into
the
carriage
,
but
felt
he
must
*NL*
glance
at
her
once
more
;
not
that
she
was
very
beautiful
,
not
on
account
*NL*
of
the
elegance
and
modest
grace
which
were
apparent
in
her
whole
*NL*
figure
,
but
because
in
the
expression
of
her
charming
face
,
as
she
*NL*
passed
close
by
him
,
there
was
something
peculiarly
caressing
and
soft
.
*NL*
As
he
looked
round
,
she
too
turned
her
head
.
Her
shining
gray
eyes
,
that
*NL*
looked
dark
from
the
thick
lashes
,
rested
with
friendly
attention
on
his
*NL*
face
,
as
though
she
were
recognizing
him
,
and
then
promptly
turned
away
*NL*
to
the
passing
crowd
,
as
though
seeking
someone
.
In
that
brief
look
*NL*
Vronsky
had
time
to
notice
the
suppressed
eagerness
which
played
over
*NL*
her
face
,
and
flitted
between
the
brilliant
eyes
and
the
faint
smile
*NL*
that
curved
her
red
lips
.
It
was
as
though
her
nature
were
so
brimming
*NL*
over
with
something
that
against
her
will
it
showed
itself
now
in
the
*NL*
flash
of
her
eyes
,
and
now
in
her
smile
.
Deliberately
she
shrouded
the
*NL*
light
in
her
eyes
,
but
it
shone
against
her
will
in
the
faintly
*NL*
perceptible
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
stepped
into
the
carriage
.
His
mother
,
a
dried-up
old
lady
with
*NL*
black
eyes
and
ringlets
,
screwed
up
her
eyes
,
scanning
her
son
,
and
*NL*
smiled
slightly
with
her
thin
lips
.
Getting
up
from
the
seat
and
handing
*NL*
her
maid
a
bag
,
she
gave
her
little
wrinkled
hand
to
her
son
to
kiss
,
*NL*
and
lifting
his
head
from
her
hand
,
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
my
telegram
?
Quite
well
?
Thank
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
a
good
journey
?
''
said
her
son
,
sitting
down
beside
her
,
and
*NL*
involuntarily
listening
to
a
woman
's
voice
outside
the
door
.
He
knew
it
*NL*
was
the
voice
of
the
lady
he
had
met
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
I
do
n't
agree
with
you
,
''
said
the
lady
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
Petersburg
view
,
madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
Petersburg
,
but
simply
feminine
,
''
she
responded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
allow
me
to
kiss
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Ivan
Petrovitch
.
And
could
you
see
if
my
brother
is
here
,
and
*NL*
send
him
to
me
?
''
said
the
lady
in
the
doorway
,
and
stepped
back
again
*NL*
into
the
compartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
found
your
brother
?
''
said
Countess
Vronskaya
,
addressing
*NL*
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
understood
now
that
this
was
Madame
Karenina
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
is
here
,
''
he
said
,
standing
up
.
``
Excuse
me
,
I
did
not
know
*NL*
you
,
and
,
indeed
,
our
acquaintance
was
so
slight
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
bowing
,
*NL*
``
that
no
doubt
you
do
not
remember
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
should
have
known
you
because
your
mother
and
I
*NL*
have
been
talking
,
I
think
,
of
nothing
but
you
all
the
way
.
''
As
she
*NL*
spoke
she
let
the
eagerness
that
would
insist
on
coming
out
show
itself
*NL*
in
her
smile
.
``
And
still
no
sign
of
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
call
him
,
Alexey
,
''
said
the
old
countess
.
Vronsky
stepped
out
onto
*NL*
the
platform
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oblonsky
!
Here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Karenina
,
however
,
did
not
wait
for
her
brother
,
but
catching
*NL*
sight
of
him
she
stepped
out
with
her
light
,
resolute
step
.
And
as
soon
*NL*
as
her
brother
had
reached
her
,
with
a
gesture
that
struck
Vronsky
by
*NL*
its
decision
and
its
grace
,
she
flung
her
left
arm
around
his
neck
,
drew
*NL*
him
rapidly
to
her
,
and
kissed
him
warmly
.
Vronsky
gazed
,
never
taking
*NL*
his
eyes
from
her
,
and
smiled
,
he
could
not
have
said
why
.
But
*NL*
recollecting
that
his
mother
was
waiting
for
him
,
he
went
back
again
*NL*
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
sweet
,
is
n't
she
?
''
said
the
countess
of
Madame
Karenina
.
*NL*
``
Her
husband
put
her
with
me
,
and
I
was
delighted
to
have
her
.
We
've
*NL*
been
talking
all
the
way
.
And
so
you
,
I
hear
...
_
vous
filez
le
parfait
*NL*
amour

Tant
mieux
,
mon
cher
,
tant
mieux

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
are
referring
to
,
maman
,
''
he
answered
coldly
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
maman
,
let
us
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Karenina
entered
the
carriage
again
to
say
good-bye
to
the
*NL*
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
countess
,
you
have
met
your
son
,
and
I
my
brother
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
And
all
my
gossip
is
exhausted
.
I
should
have
nothing
more
to
tell
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
the
countess
,
taking
her
hand
.
``
I
could
go
all
around
the
*NL*
world
with
you
and
never
be
dull
.
You
are
one
of
those
delightful
women
*NL*
in
whose
company
it
's
sweet
to
be
silent
as
well
as
to
talk
.
Now
please
*NL*
do
n't
fret
over
your
son
;
you
ca
n't
expect
never
to
be
parted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Karenina
stood
quite
still
,
holding
herself
very
erect
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
were
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
the
countess
said
in
explanation
to
her
son
,
``
has
a
*NL*
little
son
eight
years
old
,
I
believe
,
and
she
has
never
been
parted
*NL*
from
him
before
,
and
she
keeps
fretting
over
leaving
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
countess
and
I
have
been
talking
all
the
time
,
I
of
my
son
and
*NL*
she
of
hers
,
''
said
Madame
Karenina
,
and
again
a
smile
lighted
up
her
*NL*
face
,
a
caressing
smile
intended
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
that
you
must
have
been
dreadfully
bored
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
promptly
catching
the
ball
of
coquetry
she
had
flung
him
.
But
apparently
*NL*
she
did
not
care
to
pursue
the
conversation
in
that
strain
,
and
she
*NL*
turned
to
the
old
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
so
much
.
The
time
has
passed
so
quickly
.
Good-bye
,
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
my
love
,
''
answered
the
countess
.
``
Let
me
have
a
kiss
of
your
*NL*
pretty
face
.
I
speak
plainly
,
at
my
age
,
and
I
tell
you
simply
that
I
've
*NL*
lost
my
heart
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stereotyped
as
the
phrase
was
,
Madame
Karenina
obviously
believed
it
and
*NL*
was
delighted
by
it
.
She
flushed
,
bent
down
slightly
,
and
put
her
cheek
*NL*
to
the
countess
's
lips
,
drew
herself
up
again
,
and
with
the
same
smile
*NL*
fluttering
between
her
lips
and
her
eyes
,
she
gave
her
hand
to
Vronsky
.
*NL*
He
pressed
the
little
hand
she
gave
him
,
and
was
delighted
,
as
though
at
*NL*
something
special
,
by
the
energetic
squeeze
with
which
she
freely
and
*NL*
vigorously
shook
his
hand
.
She
went
out
with
the
rapid
step
which
bore
*NL*
her
rather
fully-developed
figure
with
such
strange
lightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
charming
,
''
said
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
just
what
her
son
was
thinking
.
His
eyes
followed
her
till
her
*NL*
graceful
figure
was
out
of
sight
,
and
then
the
smile
remained
on
his
*NL*
face
.
He
saw
out
of
the
window
how
she
went
up
to
her
brother
,
put
her
*NL*
arm
in
his
,
and
began
telling
him
something
eagerly
,
obviously
something
*NL*
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
,
Vronsky
,
and
at
that
he
felt
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
maman
,
are
you
perfectly
well
?
''
he
repeated
,
turning
to
his
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
has
been
delightful
.
Alexander
has
been
very
good
,
and
Marie
*NL*
has
grown
very
pretty
.
She
's
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
telling
him
again
of
what
interested
her
most
--
the
*NL*
christening
of
her
grandson
,
for
which
she
had
been
staying
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
the
special
favor
shown
her
elder
son
by
the
Tsar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Lavrenty
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
looking
out
of
the
window
;
``
now
we
can
*NL*
go
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
butler
who
had
traveled
with
the
countess
,
came
to
the
carriage
*NL*
to
announce
that
everything
was
ready
,
and
the
countess
got
up
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
;
there
's
not
such
a
crowd
now
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maid
took
a
handbag
and
the
lap
dog
,
the
butler
and
a
porter
the
*NL*
other
baggage
.
Vronsky
gave
his
mother
his
arm
;
but
just
as
they
were
*NL*
getting
out
of
the
carriage
several
men
ran
suddenly
by
with
*NL*
panic-stricken
faces
.
The
station-master
,
too
,
ran
by
in
his
*NL*
extraordinary
colored
cap
.
Obviously
something
unusual
had
happened
.
The
*NL*
crowd
who
had
left
the
train
were
running
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
...
What
?
...
Where
?
...
Flung
himself
!
...
Crushed
!
...
''
was
heard
*NL*
among
the
crowd
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
his
sister
on
his
arm
,
turned
*NL*
back
.
They
too
looked
scared
,
and
stopped
at
the
carriage
door
to
avoid
*NL*
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
got
in
,
while
Vronsky
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
followed
the
*NL*
crowd
to
find
out
details
of
the
disaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
guard
,
either
drunk
or
too
much
muffled
up
in
the
bitter
frost
,
had
*NL*
not
heard
the
train
moving
back
,
and
had
been
crushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Vronsky
and
Oblonsky
came
back
the
ladies
heard
the
facts
from
*NL*
the
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oblonsky
and
Vronsky
had
both
seen
the
mutilated
corpse
.
Oblonsky
was
*NL*
evidently
upset
.
He
frowned
and
seemed
ready
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
awful
!
Ah
,
Anna
,
if
you
had
seen
it
!
Ah
,
how
awful
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
did
not
speak
;
his
handsome
face
was
serious
,
but
perfectly
*NL*
composed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
had
seen
it
,
countess
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
And
his
*NL*
wife
was
there
...
It
was
awful
to
see
her
!
...
She
flung
herself
on
the
*NL*
body
.
They
say
he
was
the
only
support
of
an
immense
family
.
How
awful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
one
do
anything
for
her
?
''
said
Madame
Karenina
in
an
agitated
*NL*
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
glanced
at
her
,
and
immediately
got
out
of
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
back
directly
,
maman
,
''
he
remarked
,
turning
round
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
back
a
few
minutes
later
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
already
*NL*
in
conversation
with
the
countess
about
the
new
singer
,
while
the
*NL*
countess
was
impatiently
looking
towards
the
door
,
waiting
for
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
be
off
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
coming
in
.
They
went
out
together
.
*NL*
Vronsky
was
in
front
with
his
mother
.
Behind
walked
Madame
Karenina
with
*NL*
her
brother
.
Just
as
they
were
going
out
of
the
station
the
*NL*
station-master
overtook
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
my
assistant
two
hundred
roubles
.
Would
you
kindly
explain
for
*NL*
whose
benefit
you
intend
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
widow
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
``
I
should
have
*NL*
thought
there
was
no
need
to
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
that
?
''
cried
Oblonsky
,
behind
,
and
,
pressing
his
sister
's
*NL*
hand
,
he
added
:
``
Very
nice
,
very
nice
!
Is
n't
he
a
splendid
fellow
?
*NL*
Good-bye
,
countess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
and
his
sister
stood
still
,
looking
for
her
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
out
the
Vronsky
's
carriage
had
already
driven
away
.
*NL*
People
coming
in
were
still
talking
of
what
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
horrible
death
!
''
said
a
gentleman
,
passing
by
.
``
They
say
he
was
*NL*
cut
in
two
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
think
it
's
the
easiest
--
instantaneous
,
''
observed
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
they
do
n't
take
proper
precautions
?
''
said
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Karenina
seated
herself
in
the
carriage
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
saw
with
surprise
that
her
lips
were
quivering
,
and
she
was
with
*NL*
difficulty
restraining
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Anna
?
''
he
asked
,
when
they
had
driven
a
few
hundred
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
omen
of
evil
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
You
've
come
,
that
's
the
*NL*
chief
thing

You
ca
n't
conceive
how
I
'm
resting
my
hopes
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
known
Vronsky
long
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
know
we
're
hoping
he
will
marry
Kitty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
said
Anna
softly
.
``
Come
now
,
let
us
talk
of
you
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
tossing
her
head
,
as
though
she
would
physically
shake
off
something
*NL*
superfluous
oppressing
her
.
``
Let
us
talk
of
your
affairs
.
I
got
your
*NL*
letter
,
and
here
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
all
my
hopes
are
in
you
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
tell
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
began
to
tell
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
Oblonsky
helped
his
sister
out
,
sighed
,
pressed
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
set
off
to
his
office
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anna
went
into
the
room
,
Dolly
was
sitting
in
the
little
*NL*
drawing-room
with
a
white-headed
fat
little
boy
,
already
like
his
*NL*
father
,
giving
him
a
lesson
in
French
reading
.
As
the
boy
read
,
he
kept
*NL*
twisting
and
trying
to
tear
off
a
button
that
was
nearly
off
his
jacket
.
*NL*
His
mother
had
several
times
taken
his
hand
from
it
,
but
the
fat
little
*NL*
hand
went
back
to
the
button
again
.
His
mother
pulled
the
button
off
and
*NL*
put
it
in
her
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
your
hands
still
,
Grisha
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
took
up
her
work
,
a
*NL*
coverlet
she
had
long
been
making
.
She
always
set
to
work
on
it
at
*NL*
depressed
moments
,
and
now
she
knitted
at
it
nervously
,
twitching
her
*NL*
fingers
and
counting
the
stitches
.
Though
she
had
sent
word
the
day
*NL*
before
to
her
husband
that
it
was
nothing
to
her
whether
his
sister
came
*NL*
or
not
,
she
had
made
everything
ready
for
her
arrival
,
and
was
expecting
*NL*
her
sister-in-law
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
crushed
by
her
sorrow
,
utterly
swallowed
up
by
it
.
Still
she
*NL*
did
not
forget
that
Anna
,
her
sister-in-law
,
was
the
wife
of
one
of
the
*NL*
most
important
personages
in
Petersburg
,
and
was
a
Petersburg
_
grande
*NL*
dame
_
.
And
,
thanks
to
this
circumstance
,
she
did
not
carry
out
her
*NL*
threat
to
her
husband
--
that
is
to
say
,
she
remembered
that
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
was
coming
.
``
And
,
after
all
,
Anna
is
in
no
wise
to
blame
,
''
*NL*
thought
Dolly
.
``
I
know
nothing
of
her
except
the
very
best
,
and
I
have
*NL*
seen
nothing
but
kindness
and
affection
from
her
towards
myself
.
''
It
was
*NL*
true
that
as
far
as
she
could
recall
her
impressions
at
Petersburg
at
*NL*
the
Karenins
'
,
she
did
not
like
their
household
itself
;
there
was
*NL*
something
artificial
in
the
whole
framework
of
their
family
life
.
``
But
*NL*
why
should
I
not
receive
her
?
If
only
she
does
n't
take
it
into
her
head
*NL*
to
console
me
!
''
thought
Dolly
.
``
All
consolation
and
counsel
and
*NL*
Christian
forgiveness
,
all
that
I
have
thought
over
a
thousand
times
,
*NL*
and
it
's
all
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
days
Dolly
had
been
alone
with
her
children
.
She
did
not
want
*NL*
to
talk
of
her
sorrow
,
but
with
that
sorrow
in
her
heart
she
could
not
*NL*
talk
of
outside
matters
.
She
knew
that
in
one
way
or
another
she
would
*NL*
tell
Anna
everything
,
and
she
was
alternately
glad
at
the
thought
of
*NL*
speaking
freely
,
and
angry
at
the
necessity
of
speaking
of
her
*NL*
humiliation
with
her
,
his
sister
,
and
of
hearing
her
ready-made
phrases
*NL*
of
good
advice
and
comfort
.
She
had
been
on
the
lookout
for
her
,
*NL*
glancing
at
her
watch
every
minute
,
and
,
as
so
often
happens
,
let
slip
*NL*
just
that
minute
when
her
visitor
arrived
,
so
that
she
did
not
hear
the
*NL*
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catching
a
sound
of
skirts
and
light
steps
at
the
door
,
she
looked
*NL*
round
,
and
her
care-worn
face
unconsciously
expressed
not
gladness
,
but
*NL*
wonder
.
She
got
up
and
embraced
her
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
here
already
!
''
she
said
as
she
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
too
,
''
said
Dolly
,
faintly
smiling
,
and
trying
by
the
*NL*
expression
of
Anna
's
face
to
find
out
whether
she
knew
.
``
Most
likely
she
*NL*
knows
,
''
she
thought
,
noticing
the
sympathy
in
Anna
's
face
.
``
Well
,
come
*NL*
along
,
I
'll
take
you
to
your
room
,
''
she
went
on
,
trying
to
defer
as
long
*NL*
as
possible
the
moment
of
confidences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Grisha
?
Heavens
,
how
he
's
grown
!
''
said
Anna
;
and
kissing
him
,
*NL*
never
taking
her
eyes
off
Dolly
,
she
stood
still
and
flushed
a
little
.
*NL*
``
No
,
please
,
let
us
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
off
her
kerchief
and
her
hat
,
and
catching
it
in
a
lock
of
her
*NL*
black
hair
,
which
was
a
mass
of
curls
,
she
tossed
her
head
and
shook
her
*NL*
hair
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
radiant
with
health
and
happiness
!
''
said
Dolly
,
almost
with
*NL*
envy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
...
Yes
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
Merciful
heavens
,
Tanya
!
You
're
the
same
age
*NL*
as
my
Seryozha
,
''
she
added
,
addressing
the
little
girl
as
she
ran
in
.
*NL*
She
took
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
.
``
Delightful
child
,
delightful
!
*NL*
Show
me
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
mentioned
them
,
not
only
remembering
the
names
,
but
the
years
,
*NL*
months
,
characters
,
illnesses
of
all
the
children
,
and
Dolly
could
not
*NL*
but
appreciate
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
we
will
go
to
them
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
a
pity
Vassya
's
*NL*
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
seeing
the
children
,
they
sat
down
,
alone
now
,
in
the
drawing
*NL*
room
,
to
coffee
.
Anna
took
the
tray
,
and
then
pushed
it
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
''
she
said
,
``
he
has
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
looked
coldly
at
Anna
;
she
was
waiting
now
for
phrases
of
*NL*
conventional
sympathy
,
but
Anna
said
nothing
of
the
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
dear
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
speak
for
him
to
you
,
nor
to
*NL*
try
to
comfort
you
;
that
's
impossible
.
But
,
darling
,
I
'm
simply
sorry
,
*NL*
sorry
from
my
heart
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
thick
lashes
of
her
shining
eyes
tears
suddenly
glittered
.
She
*NL*
moved
nearer
to
her
sister-in-law
and
took
her
hand
in
her
vigorous
*NL*
little
hand
.
Dolly
did
not
shrink
away
,
but
her
face
did
not
lose
its
*NL*
frigid
expression
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
comfort
me
's
impossible
.
Everything
's
lost
after
what
has
happened
,
*NL*
everything
's
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
directly
she
had
said
this
,
her
face
suddenly
softened
.
Anna
lifted
*NL*
the
wasted
,
thin
hand
of
Dolly
,
kissed
it
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Dolly
,
what
's
to
be
done
,
what
's
to
be
done
?
How
is
it
best
to
act
*NL*
in
this
awful
position
--
that
's
what
you
must
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
's
over
,
and
there
's
nothing
more
,
''
said
Dolly
.
``
And
the
worst
of
*NL*
all
is
,
you
see
,
that
I
ca
n't
cast
him
off
:
there
are
the
children

I
am
*NL*
tied

And
I
ca

live
with
him

it
's
a
torture
to
me
to
see
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
darling

he
has
spoken
to
me
,
but
I
want
to
hear
it
from
you

tell
me
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
looked
at
her
inquiringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sympathy
and
love
unfeigned
were
visible
on
Anna
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
she
said
all
at
once
.
``
But
I
will
tell
you
it
from
the
*NL*
beginning
.
You
know
how
I
was
married
.
With
the
education
mamma
gave
us
*NL*
I
was
more
than
innocent
,
I
was
stupid
.
I
knew
nothing
.
I
know
they
say
*NL*
men
tell
their
wives
of
their
former
lives
,
but
Stiva
''
--
she
corrected
*NL*
herself
--
``
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
told
me
nothing
.
You
'll
hardly
believe
it
,
*NL*
but
till
now
I
imagined
that
I
was
the
only
woman
he
had
known
.
So
I
*NL*
lived
eight
years
.
You
must
understand
that
I
was
so
far
from
suspecting
*NL*
infidelity
,
I
regarded
it
as
impossible
,
and
then
--
try
to
imagine
*NL*
it
--
with
such
ideas
,
to
find
out
suddenly
all
the
horror
,
all
the
*NL*
loathsomeness
...
You
must
try
and
understand
me
.
To
be
fully
convinced
*NL*
of
one
's
happiness

all
at
once

continued
Dolly
,
holding
back
*NL*
her
sobs
,
``
to
get
a
letter

his
letter
to
his
mistress

my
governess

*NL*
No
,
it
's
too
awful
!

She
hastily
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
hid
her
*NL*
face
in
it
.
``
I
can
understand
being
carried
away
by
feeling
,
''
she
went
*NL*
on
after
a
brief
silence
,
``
but
deliberately
,
slyly
deceiving
me

and
*NL*
with
whom
?

To
go
on
being
my
husband
together
with
her

it
's
*NL*
awful

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

I

I

I
do

*NL*
said
Anna
,
pressing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
imagine
he
realizes
all
the
awfulness

Dolly
*NL*
resumed
.
``
Not
the
slightest

He
's
happy

contented

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

Anna
interposed
quickly
.
``
He
's
to
be
pitied

he
's
weighed
down
*NL*
by
remorse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
capable
of
remorse

Dolly
interrupted
,
gazing
intently
into
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
know
him

I
could
not
look
at
him
without
feeling
sorry
for
him

*NL*
We
both
know
him

He
's
good-hearted
,

he
's
proud
,
and
now
he
's
so
*NL*
humiliated

What
touched
me
most
...
''
-LRB-
and
here
Anna
guessed
what
would
*NL*
touch
Dolly
most
-RRB-
``
he
's
tortured
by
two
things
:
that
he
's
ashamed
for
*NL*
the
children
's
sake

and
that
,
loving
you
--
yes
,
yes
,
loving
you
beyond
*NL*
everything
on
earth

''
she
hurriedly
interrupted
Dolly
,
who
would
have
*NL*
answered
--
``
he
has
hurt
you
,
pierced
you
to
the
heart

`
No

no

*NL*
can
not
forgive
me

he
keeps
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
looked
dreamily
away
beyond
her
sister-in-law
as
she
listened
to
*NL*
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
can
see
that
his
position
is
awful
;
it
's
worse
for
the
guilty
*NL*
than
the
innocent

she
said
,
``
if
he
feels
that
all
the
misery
comes
*NL*
from
his
fault

But
how
am
I
to
forgive
him
,
how
am
I
to
be
his
wife
*NL*
again
after
her
?
For
me
to
live
with
him
now
would
be
torture
,
just
*NL*
because
I
love
my
past
love
for
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
sobs
cut
short
her
words
.
But
as
though
of
set
design
,
each
time
she
*NL*
was
softened
she
began
to
speak
again
of
what
exasperated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
young

you
see

she

pretty

she
went
on

youth

*NL*
I
have
worked
for
him

all
I
had
has
gone
in
his
service
,
and
now
of
*NL*
course
any
fresh
,
vulgar
creature
has
more
charm
for
him
.
No
doubt
they
*NL*
talked
of
me
together
,
or
,
worse
still

they
were
silent

Do
you
*NL*
understand

*NL*
*NL*
Again
her
eyes
glowed
with
hatred

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after

he
will
tell

now

awful
is

all
at

turned

instead
of

I

nothing

Dolly
grew
calmer

for
two

both
were
silent

her

saw
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

more
of
the

than
you
do

she
said
.
``
I
know
how
men
like
*NL*
Stiva
look
at
it

You
speak
of
his
talking
of
you
with
her
.
That
never
*NL*
happened
.
Such
men
are
unfaithful
,
but
their
home
and
wife
are
sacred
to
*NL*
them
.
Somehow
or
other
these
women
are
still
looked
on
with
contempt
by
*NL*
them
,
and
do
not
touch
on
their
feeling
for
their
family
.
They
draw
a
*NL*
sort
of
line
that
ca
n't
be
crossed
between
them
and
their
families
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
it
,

it
is
so
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
he
has
kissed
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolly
,
hush

darling

I
saw
Stiva
when
he
was
in
love
with
you

I
*NL*
remember
the
time
when
he
came
to
me
and
cried
,
talking
of
you
,
and
all
*NL*
the
poetry
and
loftiness
of
his
feeling
for
you
,
and
I
know
that
the
*NL*
longer
he
has
lived
with
you
the
loftier
you
have
been
in
his
eyes
.
You
*NL*
know
we
have
sometimes
laughed
at
him
for
putting
in
at
every
word
:
*NL*
`
Dolly
's
a
marvelous
woman
.
'
You
have
always
been
a
divinity
for
him
,
*NL*
and
you
are
that
still
,
and
this
has
not
been
an
infidelity
of
the
*NL*
heart

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
it
is
repeated
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be

as
I
understand
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
could
you
forgive
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

I
ca

Yes

I

''
said
Anna
,
thinking
a
*NL*
moment
;
and
grasping
the
position
in
her
thought
and
weighing
it
in
her
*NL*
inner
balance
,
she
added
:
``
Yes
,
I
can

I
can

I
can

Yes

I

I

no

I

forgive

forgive

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Dolly
interposed
quickly
,
as
though
saying
what
she
had
*NL*
more
than
once
thought
,
``
else
it
would
not

forgiveness

If

it

go

I
'll
take

she
said
,
getting
up
,
and
on
the
way
she
embraced
*NL*
Anna
.
``
My

glad

*NL*
The
whole
of
that
day
Anna
spent
at
home
,
that
's
to
say
at
the
*NL*
Oblonskys
'
,
and
received
no
one
,
though
some
of
her
acquaintances
had
*NL*
already
heard
of
her
arrival
,
and
came
to
call
the
same
day
.
Anna
spent
*NL*
the
whole
morning
with
Dolly
and
the
children
.
She
merely
sent
a
brief
*NL*
note
to
her
brother
to
tell
him
that
he
must
not
fail
to
dine
at
home
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
God
is
merciful
,
''
she
wrote
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oblonsky
did
dine
at
home
:
the
conversation
was
general
,
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
speaking
to
him
,
addressed
him
as
``
Stiva
,
''
as
she
had
not
done
before
.
*NL*
In
the
relations
of
the
husband
and
wife
the
same
estrangement
still
*NL*
remained
,
but
there
was
no
talk
now
of
separation
,
and
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
saw
the
possibility
of
explanation
and
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
dinner
Kitty
came
in
.
She
knew
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
but
*NL*
only
very
slightly
,
and
she
came
now
to
her
sister
's
with
some
*NL*
trepidation
,
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
this
fashionable
Petersburg
*NL*
lady
,
whom
everyone
spoke
so
highly
of
.
But
she
made
a
favorable
*NL*
impression
on
Anna
Arkadyevna
--
she
saw
that
at
once
.
Anna
was
*NL*
unmistakably
admiring
her
loveliness
and
her
youth
:
before
Kitty
knew
*NL*
where
she
was
she
found
herself
not
merely
under
Anna
's
sway
,
but
in
*NL*
love
with
her
,
as
young
girls
do
fall
in
love
with
older
and
married
*NL*
women
.
Anna
was
not
like
a
fashionable
lady
,
nor
the
mother
of
a
boy
of
*NL*
eight
years
old
.
In
the
elasticity
of
her
movements
,
the
freshness
and
*NL*
the
unflagging
eagerness
which
persisted
in
her
face
,
and
broke
out
in
*NL*
her
smile
and
her
glance
,
she
would
rather
have
passed
for
a
girl
of
*NL*
twenty
,
had
it
not
been
for
a
serious
and
at
times
mournful
look
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
which
struck
and
attracted
Kitty
.
Kitty
felt
that
Anna
was
*NL*
perfectly
simple
and
was
concealing
nothing
,
but
that
she
had
another
*NL*
higher
world
of
interests
inaccessible
to
her
,
complex
and
poetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
when
Dolly
went
away
to
her
own
room
,
Anna
rose
quickly
*NL*
and
went
up
to
her
brother
,
who
was
just
lighting
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
winking
gaily
,
crossing
him
and
glancing
*NL*
towards
the
door
,
``
go
,
and
God
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
down
the
cigar
,
understanding
her
,
and
departed
through
the
*NL*
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
disappeared
,
she
went
back
to
the
sofa
*NL*
where
she
had
been
sitting
,
surrounded
by
the
children
.
Either
because
*NL*
the
children
saw
that
their
mother
was
fond
of
this
aunt
,
or
that
they
*NL*
felt
a
special
charm
in
her
themselves
,
the
two
elder
ones
,
and
the
*NL*
younger
following
their
lead
,
as
children
so
often
do
,
had
clung
about
*NL*
their
new
aunt
since
before
dinner
,
and
would
not
leave
her
side
.
And
it
*NL*
had
become
a
sort
of
game
among
them
to
sit
a
close
as
possible
to
their
*NL*
aunt
,
to
touch
her
,
hold
her
little
hand
,
kiss
it
,
play
with
her
ring
,
*NL*
or
even
touch
the
flounce
of
her
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
as
we
were
sitting
before
,
''
said
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
sitting
*NL*
down
in
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
Grisha
poked
his
little
face
under
her
arm
,
and
nestled
with
*NL*
his
head
on
her
gown
,
beaming
with
pride
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
is
your
next
ball
?
''
she
asked
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
week
,
and
a
splendid
ball
.
One
of
those
balls
where
one
always
*NL*
enjoys
oneself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
there
balls
where
one
always
enjoys
oneself
?
''
Anna
said
,
with
*NL*
tender
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
strange
,
but
there
are
.
At
the
Bobrishtchevs
'
one
always
enjoys
*NL*
oneself
,
and
at
the
Nikitins
'
too
,
while
at
the
Mezhkovs
'
it
's
always
*NL*
dull
.
Have
n't
you
noticed
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
for
me
there
are
no
balls
now
where
one
enjoys
oneself
,
''
*NL*
said
Anna
,
and
Kitty
detected
in
her
eyes
that
mysterious
world
which
*NL*
was
not
open
to
her
.
``
For
me
there
are
some
less
dull
and
tiresome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
_
you
_
be
dull
at
a
ball
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
not
_
I
_
be
dull
at
a
ball
?
''
inquired
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
perceived
that
Anna
knew
what
answer
would
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
always
look
nicer
than
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
the
faculty
of
blushing
.
She
blushed
a
little
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
it
's
never
so
;
and
secondly
,
if
it
were
,
what
*NL*
difference
would
it
make
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
to
this
ball
?
''
asked
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
it
wo
n't
be
possible
to
avoid
going
.
Here
,
take
it
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
Tanya
,
who
was
pulling
the
loosely-fitting
ring
off
her
white
,
*NL*
slender-tipped
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
so
glad
if
you
go
.
I
should
so
like
to
see
you
at
a
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
if
I
do
go
,
I
shall
comfort
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
's
a
*NL*
pleasure
to
you
...
Grisha
,
do
n't
pull
my
hair
.
It
's
untidy
enough
*NL*
without
that
,
''
she
said
,
putting
up
a
straying
lock
,
which
Grisha
had
*NL*
been
playing
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
you
at
the
ball
in
lilac
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
in
lilac
precisely
?
''
asked
Anna
,
smiling
.
``
Now
,
children
,
run
*NL*
along
,
run
along

Do
you
hear
?
Miss
Hoole
is
calling
you
to
tea

''
she
*NL*
said
,
tearing
the
children
from
her
,
and
sending
them
off
to
the
dining
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
why
you
press
me
to
come
to
the
ball

You
expect
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
this
ball
,
and
you
want
everyone
to
be
there
to
take
part
in
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
what
a
happy
time
you
are
at

''
pursued
Anna
.
``
I
remember
,
and
I
*NL*
know
that
blue
haze
like
the
mist
on
the
mountains
in
Switzerland

That
*NL*
mist
which
covers
everything
in
that
blissful
time
when
childhood
is
*NL*
just
ending
,
and
out
of
that
vast
circle
,
happy
and
gay
,
there
is
a
path
*NL*
growing
narrower
and
narrower
,
and
it
is
delightful
and
alarming
to
*NL*
enter
the
ballroom
,
bright
and
splendid
as
it
is
...
Who
has
not
been
*NL*
through
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
smiled
without
speaking
.
``
But
how
did
she
go
through
it
?
How
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
all
her
love
story

thought
Kitty
,
recalling
the
*NL*
unromantic
appearance
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
something

Stiva
told
me

and
I
congratulate
you

I
liked
him
so
*NL*
much

Anna
continued
.
``
I
met
Vronsky
at

railway
station

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

asked
Kitty

blushing
.
``
What
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
gossiped
about

glad

traveled

yesterday
with

mother

she
went
on
;
``
and
his
mother
talked
*NL*
without
a
pause

he
's
her
favorite

I
know
mothers
are
partial
,
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
his
mother
tell
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

And
I
know
that

her
favorite

still
one
can
see
*NL*
how
chivalrous
he
is

Well
,
for
instance

she
told
me
that
he
had
*NL*
wanted
to
give
up
all
his
property
to
his
brother
,
that
he
had
done
*NL*
something
extraordinary
when
he
was
quite
a
child
,
saved
a
woman
out
of
*NL*
the
water
.
He
's
a
hero

in
fact

said
Anna
,
smiling
and
recollecting
*NL*
the
two
hundred
roubles
he
had
given
at
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
tell
Kitty
about
the
two
hundred
roubles
.
For
some
*NL*
reason
it
was
disagreeable
to
her
to
think
of
it
.
She
felt
that
there
*NL*
was
something
that
had
to
do
with
her
in
it
,
and
something
that
ought
*NL*
not
to
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
pressed
me
very
much
to
go
and
see
her

Anna
went
on
;
``
and
I
shall
*NL*
be
glad

go

Stiva
is
staying
a
long
while
in
*NL*
Dolly
's
room

Anna
added
,
changing
the
subject
,
and
getting
*NL*
up
,
Kitty
fancied
,
displeased
with
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

No

screamed
the
children
,
who
had
finished
tea
,
*NL*
running
up
to
their
Aunt
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
together

said
Anna
,
and
she
ran
laughing
to
meet
them
,
and
*NL*
embraced
and
swung
round
all
the
throng
of
swarming
children

shrieking
*NL*
with
delight

Dolly
came
out
of
her
room
to
the
tea
of
the
grown-up
people
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
did
not
come
out

He
must
have
left
his
wife
's
room
by
the

other
door

*NL*
*NL*
``

into

trying
to
make
out
whether
there
had
been
a

reconciliation

not

Stepan

coming
out

addressing

From
his
tone
both

taken

Oh
,
nonsense
,
Dolly
,
always
making
difficulties
,
''
answered
her
husband
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
I
'll
do
it
all
,
if
you
like
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
must
be
reconciled
,
''
thought
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
you
do
everything
,
''
answered
Dolly
.
``
You
tell
Matvey
to
do
*NL*
what
ca
n't
be
done
,
and
go
away
yourself
,
leaving
him
to
make
a
muddle
*NL*
of
everything
,
''
and
her
habitual
,
mocking
smile
curved
the
corners
of
*NL*
Dolly
's
lips
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Full
,
full
reconciliation
,
full
,
''
thought
Anna
;
``
thank
God
!
''
and
*NL*
rejoicing
that
she
was
the
cause
of
it
,
she
went
up
to
Dolly
and
kissed
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
Why
do
you
always
look
down
on
me
and
Matvey
?
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
hardly
perceptibly
,
and
addressing
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
evening
Dolly
was
,
as
always
,
a
little
mocking
in
her
tone
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
while
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
happy
and
cheerful
,
but
not
*NL*
so
as
to
seem
as
though
,
having
been
forgiven
,
he
had
forgotten
his
*NL*
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
nine
o'clock
a
particularly
joyful
and
pleasant
family
*NL*
conversation
over
the
tea-table
at
the
Oblonskys
'
was
broken
up
by
an
*NL*
apparently
simple
incident
.
But
this
simple
incident
for
some
reason
*NL*
struck
everyone
as
strange
.
Talking
about
common
acquaintances
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
Anna
got
up
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
in
my
album
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
,
by
the
way
,
I
'll
show
you
my
*NL*
Seryozha
,
''
she
added
,
with
a
mother
's
smile
of
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
ten
o'clock
,
when
she
usually
said
good-night
to
her
son
,
and
*NL*
often
before
going
to
a
ball
put
him
to
bed
herself
,
she
felt
depressed
*NL*
at
being
so
far
from
him
;
and
whatever
she
was
talking
about
,
she
kept
*NL*
coming
back
in
thought
to
her
curly-headed
Seryozha
.
She
longed
to
look
*NL*
at
his
photograph
and
talk
of
him
.
Seizing
the
first
pretext
,
she
got
*NL*
up
,
and
with
her
light
,
resolute
step
went
for
her
album
.
The
stairs
up
*NL*
to
her
room
came
out
on
the
landing
of
the
great
warm
main
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
she
was
leaving
the
drawing
room
,
a
ring
was
heard
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
that
be
?
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
early
for
me
to
be
fetched
,
and
for
anyone
else
it
's
late
,
''
*NL*
observed
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
to
be
someone
with
papers
for
me
,
''
put
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
When
Anna
was
passing
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
a
servant
was
running
up
*NL*
to
announce
the
visitor
,
while
the
visitor
himself
was
standing
under
a
*NL*
lamp
.
Anna
glancing
down
at
once
recognized
Vronsky
,
and
a
strange
*NL*
feeling
of
pleasure
and
at
the
same
time
of
dread
of
something
stirred
*NL*
in
her
heart
.
He
was
standing
still
,
not
taking
off
his
coat
,
pulling
*NL*
something
out
of
his
pocket
.
At
the
instant
when
she
was
just
facing
the
*NL*
stairs
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
caught
sight
of
her
,
and
into
the
expression
*NL*
of
his
face
there
passed
a
shade
of
embarrassment
and
dismay
.
With
a
*NL*
slight
inclination
of
her
head
she
passed
,
hearing
behind
her
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
loud
voice
calling
him
to
come
up
,
and
the
quiet
,
soft
,
*NL*
and
composed
voice
of
Vronsky
refusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anna
returned
with
the
album
,
he
was
already
gone
,
and
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
telling
them
that
he
had
called
to
inquire
about
the
*NL*
dinner
they
were
giving
next
day
to
a
celebrity
who
had
just
arrived
.
*NL*
``
And
nothing
would
induce
him
to
come
up
.
What
a
queer
fellow
he
is
!
''
*NL*
added
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
blushed
.
She
thought
that
she
was
the
only
person
who
knew
why
he
*NL*
had
come
,
and
why
he
would
not
come
up
.
``
He
has
been
at
home
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
,
``
and
did
n't
find
me
,
and
thought
I
should
be
here
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
come
up
because
he
thought
it
late
,
and
Anna
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
them
looked
at
each
other
,
saying
nothing
,
and
began
to
look
at
*NL*
Anna
's
album
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
either
exceptional
or
strange
in
a
man
's
calling
at
*NL*
half-past
nine
on
a
friend
to
inquire
details
of
a
proposed
dinner
party
*NL*
and
not
coming
in
,
but
it
seemed
strange
to
all
of
them
.
Above
all
,
it
*NL*
seemed
strange
and
not
right
to
Anna
.

*NL*
Chapter
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
ball
was
only
just
beginning
as
Kitty
and
her
mother
walked
up
the
*NL*
great
staircase
,
flooded
with
light
,
and
lined
with
flowers
and
footmen
*NL*
in
powder
and
red
coats
.
From
the
rooms
came
a
constant
,
steady
hum
,
as
*NL*
from
a
hive
,
and
the
rustle
of
movement
;
and
while
on
the
landing
*NL*
between
trees
they
gave
last
touches
to
their
hair
and
dresses
before
*NL*
the
mirror
,
they
heard
from
the
ballroom
the
careful
,
distinct
notes
of
*NL*
the
fiddles
of
the
orchestra
beginning
the
first
waltz
.
A
little
old
man
*NL*
in
civilian
dress
,
arranging
his
gray
curls
before
another
mirror
,
and
*NL*
diffusing
an
odor
of
scent
,
stumbled
against
them
on
the
stairs
,
and
*NL*
stood
aside
,
evidently
admiring
Kitty
,
whom
he
did
not
know
.
A
beardless
*NL*
youth
,
one
of
those
society
youths
whom
the
old
Prince
Shtcherbatsky
*NL*
called
``
young
bucks
,
''
in
an
exceedingly
open
waistcoat
,
straightening
*NL*
his
white
tie
as
he
went
,
bowed
to
them
,
and
after
running
by
,
came
back
*NL*
to
ask
Kitty
for
a
quadrille
.
As
the
first
quadrille
had
already
been
*NL*
given
to
Vronsky
,
she
had
to
promise
this
youth
the
second
.
An
officer
,
*NL*
buttoning
his
glove
,
stood
aside
in
the
doorway
,
and
stroking
his
*NL*
mustache
,
admired
rosy
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
her
dress
,
her
coiffure
,
and
all
the
preparations
for
the
ball
*NL*
had
cost
Kitty
great
trouble
and
consideration
,
at
this
moment
she
*NL*
walked
into
the
ballroom
in
her
elaborate
tulle
dress
over
a
pink
slip
*NL*
as
easily
and
simply
as
though
all
the
rosettes
and
lace
,
all
the
minute
*NL*
details
of
her
attire
,
had
not
cost
her
or
her
family
a
moment
's
*NL*
attention
,
as
though
she
had
been
born
in
that
tulle
and
lace
,
with
her
*NL*
hair
done
up
high
on
her
head
,
and
a
rose
and
two
leaves
on
the
top
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
just
before
entering
the
ballroom
,
the
princess
,
her
mother
,
tried
*NL*
to
turn
right
side
out
of
the
ribbon
of
her
sash
,
Kitty
had
drawn
back
a
*NL*
little
.
She
felt
that
everything
must
be
right
of
itself
,
and
graceful
,
*NL*
and
nothing
could
need
setting
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
Kitty
's
best
days
.
Her
dress
was
not
uncomfortable
*NL*
anywhere
;
her
lace
berthe
did
not
droop
anywhere
;
her
rosettes
were
not
*NL*
crushed
nor
torn
off
;
her
pink
slippers
with
high
,
hollowed-out
heels
*NL*
did
not
pinch
,
but
gladdened
her
feet
;
and
the
thick
rolls
of
fair
*NL*
chignon
kept
up
on
her
head
as
if
they
were
her
own
hair
.
All
the
three
*NL*
buttons
buttoned
up
without
tearing
on
the
long
glove
that
covered
her
*NL*
hand
without
concealing
its
lines
.
The
black
velvet
of
her
locket
*NL*
nestled
with
special
softness
round
her
neck
.
That
velvet
was
delicious
;
*NL*
at
home
,
looking
at
her
neck
in
the
looking
glass
,
Kitty
had
felt
that
*NL*
that
velvet
was
speaking
.
About
all
the
rest
there
might
be
a
doubt
,
but
*NL*
the
velvet
was
delicious
.
Kitty
smiled
here
too
,
at
the
ball
,
when
she
*NL*
glanced
at
it
in
the
glass
.
Her
bare
shoulders
and
arms
gave
Kitty
a
*NL*
sense
of
chill
marble
,
a
feeling
she
particularly
liked
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
,
and
her
rosy
lips
could
not
keep
from
smiling
from
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
her
own
attractiveness
.
She
had
scarcely
entered
the
*NL*
ballroom
and
reached
the
throng
of
ladies
,
all
tulle
,
ribbons
,
lace
,
and
*NL*
flowers
,
waiting
to
be
asked
to
dance
--
Kitty
was
never
one
of
that
*NL*
throng
--
when
she
was
asked
for
a
waltz
,
and
asked
by
the
best
partner
,
*NL*
the
first
star
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
ballroom
,
a
renowned
director
of
*NL*
dances
,
a
married
man
,
handsome
and
well-built
,
Yegorushka
Korsunsky
.
He
*NL*
had
only
just
left
the
Countess
Bonina
,
with
whom
he
had
danced
the
*NL*
first
half
of
the
waltz
,
and
,
scanning
his
kingdom
--
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
few
couples
who
had
started
dancing
--
he
caught
sight
of
Kitty
,
entering
,
*NL*
and
flew
up
to
her
with
that
peculiar
,
easy
amble
which
is
confined
to
*NL*
directors
of
balls
.
Without
even
asking
her
if
she
cared
to
dance
,
he
*NL*
put
out
his
arm
to
encircle
her
slender
waist
.
She
looked
round
for
*NL*
someone
to
give
her
fan
to
,
and
their
hostess
,
smiling
to
her
,
took
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nice
you
've
come
in
good
time
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
embracing
her
*NL*
waist
;
``
such
a
bad
habit
to
be
late
.
''
Bending
her
left
hand
,
she
laid
it
*NL*
on
his
shoulder
,
and
her
little
feet
in
their
pink
slippers
began
*NL*
swiftly
,
lightly
,
and
rhythmically
moving
over
the
slippery
floor
in
*NL*
time
to
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
rest
to
waltz
with
you
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
as
they
fell
into
the
*NL*
first
slow
steps
of
the
waltz
.
``
It
's
exquisite
--
such
lightness
,
*NL*
precision
.
''
He
said
to
her
the
same
thing
he
said
to
almost
all
his
*NL*
partners
whom
he
knew
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
at
his
praise
,
and
continued
to
look
about
the
room
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
She
was
not
like
a
girl
at
her
first
ball
,
for
whom
all
faces
*NL*
in
the
ballroom
melt
into
one
vision
of
fairyland
.
And
she
was
not
a
*NL*
girl
who
had
gone
the
stale
round
of
balls
till
every
face
in
the
*NL*
ballroom
was
familiar
and
tiresome
.
But
she
was
in
the
middle
stage
*NL*
between
these
two
;
she
was
excited
,
and
at
the
same
time
she
had
*NL*
sufficient
self-possession
to
be
able
to
observe
.
In
the
left
corner
of
*NL*
the
ballroom
she
saw
the
cream
of
society
gathered
together
.
*NL*
There
--
incredibly
naked
--
was
the
beauty
Lidi
,
Korsunsky
's
wife
;
there
*NL*
was
the
lady
of
the
house
;
there
shone
the
bald
head
of
Krivin
,
always
*NL*
to
be
found
where
the
best
people
were
.
In
that
direction
gazed
the
*NL*
young
men
,
not
venturing
to
approach
.
There
,
too
,
she
descried
Stiva
,
*NL*
and
there
she
saw
the
exquisite
figure
and
head
of
Anna
in
a
black
*NL*
velvet
gown
.
And
_
he
_
was
there
.
Kitty
had
not
seen
him
since
the
*NL*
evening
she
refused
Levin
.
With
her
long-sighted
eyes
,
she
knew
him
at
*NL*
once
,
and
was
even
aware
that
he
was
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
turn
,
eh
?
You
're
not
tired
?
''
said
Korsunsky
,
a
little
out
of
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
I
take
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Karenina
's
here
,
I
think
...
take
me
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wherever
you
command
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Korsunsky
began
waltzing
with
measured
steps
straight
towards
the
*NL*
group
in
the
left
corner
,
continually
saying
,
``
Pardon
,
mesdames
,
pardon
,
*NL*
pardon
,
mesdames
''
;
and
steering
his
course
through
the
sea
of
lace
,
*NL*
tulle
,
and
ribbon
,
and
not
disarranging
a
feather
,
he
turned
his
partner
*NL*
sharply
round
,
so
that
her
slim
ankles
,
in
light
transparent
stockings
,
*NL*
were
exposed
to
view
,
and
her
train
floated
out
in
fan
shape
and
covered
*NL*
Krivin
's
knees
.
Korsunsky
bowed
,
set
straight
his
open
shirt
front
,
and
*NL*
gave
her
his
arm
to
conduct
her
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
.
Kitty
,
flushed
,
took
*NL*
her
train
from
Krivin
's
knees
,
and
,
a
little
giddy
,
looked
round
,
*NL*
seeking
Anna
.
Anna
was
not
in
lilac
,
as
Kitty
had
so
urgently
wished
,
*NL*
but
in
a
black
,
low-cut
,
velvet
gown
,
showing
her
full
throat
and
*NL*
shoulders
,
that
looked
as
though
carved
in
old
ivory
,
and
her
rounded
*NL*
arms
,
with
tiny
,
slender
wrists
.
The
whole
gown
was
trimmed
with
*NL*
Venetian
guipure
.
On
her
head
,
among
her
black
hair
--
her
own
,
with
no
*NL*
false
additions
--
was
a
little
wreath
of
pansies
,
and
a
bouquet
of
the
*NL*
same
in
the
black
ribbon
of
her
sash
among
white
lace
.
Her
coiffure
was
*NL*
not
striking
.
All
that
was
noticeable
was
the
little
wilful
tendrils
of
*NL*
her
curly
hair
that
would
always
break
free
about
her
neck
and
temples
.
*NL*
Round
her
well-cut
,
strong
neck
was
a
thread
of
pearls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
had
been
seeing
Anna
every
day
;
she
adored
her
,
and
had
pictured
*NL*
her
invariably
in
lilac
.
But
now
seeing
her
in
black
,
she
felt
that
she
*NL*
had
not
fully
seen
her
charm
.
She
saw
her
now
as
someone
quite
new
and
*NL*
surprising
to
her
.
Now
she
understood
that
Anna
could
not
have
been
in
*NL*
lilac
,
and
that
her
charm
was
just
that
she
always
stood
out
against
her
*NL*
attire
,
that
her
dress
could
never
be
noticeable
on
her
.
And
her
black
*NL*
dress
,
with
its
sumptuous
lace
,
was
not
noticeable
on
her
;
it
was
only
*NL*
the
frame
,
and
all
that
was
seen
was
she
--
simple
,
natural
,
elegant
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
gay
and
eager
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
holding
herself
,
as
always
,
very
erect
,
and
when
Kitty
*NL*
drew
near
the
group
she
was
speaking
to
the
master
of
the
house
,
her
*NL*
head
slightly
turned
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
throw
stones
,
''
she
was
saying
,
in
answer
to
something
,
*NL*
``
though
I
ca
n't
understand
it
,
''
she
went
on
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
*NL*
and
she
turned
at
once
with
a
soft
smile
of
protection
towards
Kitty
.
*NL*
With
a
flying
,
feminine
glance
she
scanned
her
attire
,
and
made
a
*NL*
movement
of
her
head
,
hardly
perceptible
,
but
understood
by
Kitty
,
*NL*
signifying
approval
of
her
dress
and
her
looks
.
``
You
came
into
the
room
*NL*
dancing
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
one
of
my
most
faithful
supporters
,
''
said
Korsunsky
,
bowing
to
*NL*
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
whom
he
had
not
yet
seen
.
``
The
princess
helps
to
make
*NL*
balls
happy
and
successful
.
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
a
waltz
?
''
he
said
,
bending
*NL*
down
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
have
you
met
?
''
inquired
their
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anyone
we
have
not
met
?
My
wife
and
I
are
like
white
*NL*
wolves
--
everyone
knows
us
,
''
answered
Korsunsky
.
``
A
waltz
,
Anna
*NL*
Arkadyevna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
dance
when
it
's
possible
not
to
dance
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tonight
it
's
impossible
,
''
answered
Korsunsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Vronsky
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
since
it
's
impossible
tonight
,
let
us
start
,
''
she
said
,
not
*NL*
noticing
Vronsky
's
bow
,
and
she
hastily
put
her
hand
on
Korsunsky
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
vexed
with
him
about
?
''
thought
Kitty
,
discerning
that
Anna
*NL*
had
intentionally
not
responded
to
Vronsky
's
bow
.
Vronsky
went
up
to
*NL*
Kitty
reminding
her
of
the
first
quadrille
,
and
expressing
his
regret
*NL*
that
he
had
not
seen
her
all
this
time
.
Kitty
gazed
in
admiration
at
*NL*
Anna
waltzing
,
and
listened
to
him
.
She
expected
him
to
ask
her
for
a
*NL*
waltz
,
but
he
did
not
,
and
she
glanced
wonderingly
at
him
.
He
flushed
*NL*
slightly
,
and
hurriedly
asked
her
to
waltz
,
but
he
had
only
just
put
his
*NL*
arm
round
her
waist
and
taken
the
first
step
when
the
music
suddenly
*NL*
stopped
.
Kitty
looked
into
his
face
,
which
was
so
close
to
her
own
,
and
*NL*
long
afterwards
--
for
several
years
after
--
that
look
,
full
of
love
,
to
*NL*
which
he
made
no
response
,
cut
her
to
the
heart
with
an
agony
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Pardon
!
pardon
!
_
Waltz
!
waltz
!
''
shouted
Korsunsky
from
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
seizing
the
first
young
lady
he
came
across
he
began
*NL*
dancing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
and
Kitty
waltzed
several
times
round
the
room
.
After
the
first
*NL*
waltz
Kitty
went
to
her
mother
,
and
she
had
hardly
time
to
say
a
few
*NL*
words
to
Countess
Nordston
when
Vronsky
came
up
again
for
the
first
*NL*
quadrille
.
During
the
quadrille
nothing
of
any
significance
was
said
:
*NL*
there
was
disjointed
talk
between
them
of
the
Korsunskys
,
husband
and
*NL*
wife
,
whom
he
described
very
amusingly
,
as
delightful
children
at
forty
,
*NL*
and
of
the
future
town
theater
;
and
only
once
the
conversation
touched
*NL*
her
to
the
quick
,
when
he
asked
her
about
Levin
,
whether
he
was
here
,
*NL*
and
added
that
he
liked
him
so
much
.
But
Kitty
did
not
expect
much
from
*NL*
the
quadrille
.
She
looked
forward
with
a
thrill
at
her
heart
to
the
*NL*
mazurka
.
She
fancied
that
in
the
mazurka
everything
must
be
decided
.
The
*NL*
fact
that
he
did
not
during
the
quadrille
ask
her
for
the
mazurka
did
*NL*
not
trouble
her
.
She
felt
sure
she
would
dance
the
mazurka
with
him
as
*NL*
she
had
done
at
former
balls
,
and
refused
five
young
men
,
saying
she
was
*NL*
engaged
for
the
mazurka
.
The
whole
ball
up
to
the
last
quadrille
was
for
*NL*
Kitty
an
enchanted
vision
of
delightful
colors
,
sounds
,
and
motions
.
She
*NL*
only
sat
down
when
she
felt
too
tired
and
begged
for
a
rest
.
But
as
she
*NL*
was
dancing
the
last
quadrille
with
one
of
the
tiresome
young
men
whom
*NL*
she
could
not
refuse
,
she
chanced
to
be
vis-a-vis
with
Vronsky
and
Anna
.
*NL*
She
had
not
been
near
Anna
again
since
the
beginning
of
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
now
again
she
saw
her
suddenly
quite
new
and
surprising
.
She
saw
in
her
*NL*
the
signs
of
that
excitement
of
success
she
knew
so
well
in
herself
;
she
*NL*
saw
that
she
was
intoxicated
with
the
delighted
admiration
she
was
*NL*
exciting
.
She
knew
that
feeling
and
knew
its
signs
,
and
saw
them
in
*NL*
Anna
;
saw
the
quivering
,
flashing
light
in
her
eyes
,
and
the
smile
of
*NL*
happiness
and
excitement
unconsciously
playing
on
her
lips
,
and
the
*NL*
deliberate
grace
,
precision
,
and
lightness
of
her
movements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
she
asked
herself
.
``
All
or
one
?
''
And
not
assisting
the
harassed
*NL*
young
man
she
was
dancing
with
in
the
conversation
,
the
thread
of
which
*NL*
he
had
lost
and
could
not
pick
up
again
,
she
obeyed
with
external
*NL*
liveliness
the
peremptory
shouts
of
Korsunsky
starting
them
all
into
the
*NL*
_
grand
rond
_
,
and
then
into
the
_
chaine
_
,
and
at
the
same
time
she
kept
*NL*
watch
with
a
growing
pang
at
her
heart
.
``
No
,
it
's
not
the
admiration
of
*NL*
the
crowd
has
intoxicated
her
,
but
the
adoration
of
one
.
And
that
one
?
*NL*
can
it
be
he
?
''
Every
time
he
spoke
to
Anna
the
joyous
light
flashed
into
*NL*
her
eyes
,
and
the
smile
of
happiness
curved
her
red
lips
.
she
seemed
to
*NL*
make
an
effort
to
control
herself
,
to
try
not
to
show
these
signs
of
*NL*
delight
,
but
they
came
out
on
her
face
of
themselves
.
``
But
what
of
him
?
''
*NL*
Kitty
looked
at
him
and
was
filled
with
terror
.
What
was
pictured
so
*NL*
clearly
to
Kitty
in
the
mirror
of
Anna
's
face
she
saw
in
him
.
What
had
*NL*
become
of
his
always
self-possessed
resolute
manner
,
and
the
carelessly
*NL*
serene
expression
of
his
face
?
Now
every
time
he
turned
to
her
,
he
bent
*NL*
his
head
,
as
though
he
would
have
fallen
at
her
feet
,
and
in
his
eyes
*NL*
there
was
nothing
but
humble
submission
and
dread
.
``
I
would
not
offend
*NL*
you
,
''
his
eyes
seemed
every
time
to
be
saying
,
``
but
I
want
to
save
*NL*
myself
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
.
''
On
his
face
was
a
look
such
as
Kitty
had
*NL*
never
seen
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
speaking
of
common
acquaintances
,
keeping
up
the
most
trivial
*NL*
conversation
,
but
to
Kitty
it
seemed
that
every
word
they
said
was
*NL*
determining
their
fate
and
hers
.
And
strange
it
was
that
they
were
*NL*
actually
talking
of
how
absurd
Ivan
Ivanovitch
was
with
his
French
,
and
*NL*
how
the
Eletsky
girl
might
have
made
a
better
match
,
yet
these
words
had
*NL*
all
the
while
consequence
for
them
,
and
they
were
feeling
just
as
Kitty
*NL*
did
.
The
whole
ball
,
the
whole
world
,
everything
seemed
lost
in
fog
in
*NL*
Kitty
's
soul
.
Nothing
but
the
stern
discipline
of
her
bringing-up
*NL*
supported
her
and
forced
her
to
do
what
was
expected
of
her
,
that
is
,
to
*NL*
dance
,
to
answer
questions
,
to
talk
,
even
to
smile
.
But
before
the
*NL*
mazurka
,
when
they
were
beginning
to
rearrange
the
chairs
and
a
few
*NL*
couples
moved
out
of
the
smaller
rooms
into
the
big
room
,
a
moment
of
*NL*
despair
and
horror
came
for
Kitty
.
She
had
refused
five
partners
,
and
*NL*
now
she
was
not
dancing
the
mazurka
.
She
had
not
even
a
hope
of
being
*NL*
asked
for
it
,
because
she
was
so
successful
in
society
that
the
idea
*NL*
would
never
occur
to
anyone
that
she
had
remained
disengaged
till
now
.
*NL*
She
would
have
to
tell
her
mother
she
felt
ill
and
go
home
,
but
she
had
*NL*
not
the
strength
to
do
this
.
She
felt
crushed
.
She
went
to
the
furthest
*NL*
end
of
the
little
drawing
room
and
sank
into
a
low
chair
.
Her
light
,
*NL*
transparent
skirts
rose
like
a
cloud
about
her
slender
waist
;
one
bare
,
*NL*
thin
,
soft
,
girlish
arm
,
hanging
listlessly
,
was
lost
in
the
folds
of
*NL*
her
pink
tunic
;
in
the
other
she
held
her
fan
,
and
with
rapid
,
short
*NL*
strokes
fanned
her
burning
face
.
But
while
she
looked
like
a
butterfly
,
*NL*
clinging
to
a
blade
of
grass
,
and
just
about
to
open
its
rainbow
wings
*NL*
for
fresh
flight
,
her
heart
ached
with
a
horrible
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
I
am
wrong
,
perhaps
it
was
not
so
?
''
And
again
she
recalled
*NL*
all
she
had
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
what
is
it
?
''
said
Countess
Nordston
,
stepping
noiselessly
over
*NL*
the
carpet
towards
her
.
``
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
lower
lip
began
to
quiver
;
she
got
up
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
you
're
not
dancing
the
mazurka
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Kitty
in
a
voice
shaking
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
asked
her
for
the
mazurka
before
me
,
''
said
Countess
Nordston
,
*NL*
knowing
Kitty
would
understand
who
were
``
he
''
and
``
her
.
''
``
She
said
:
`
Why
,
*NL*
are
n't
you
going
to
dance
it
with
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
!
''
answered
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
but
she
herself
understood
her
position
;
no
one
knew
that
she
had
*NL*
just
refused
the
man
whom
perhaps
she
loved
,
and
refused
him
because
she
*NL*
had
put
her
faith
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Nordston
found
Korsunsky
,
with
whom
she
was
to
dance
the
*NL*
mazurka
,
and
told
him
to
ask
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
danced
in
the
first
couple
,
and
luckily
for
her
she
had
not
to
*NL*
talk
,
because
Korsunsky
was
all
the
time
running
about
directing
the
*NL*
figure
.
Vronsky
and
Anna
sat
almost
opposite
her
.
She
saw
them
with
her
*NL*
long-sighted
eyes
,
and
saw
them
,
too
,
close
by
,
when
they
met
in
the
*NL*
figures
,
and
the
more
she
saw
of
them
the
more
convinced
was
she
that
*NL*
her
unhappiness
was
complete
.
She
saw
that
they
felt
themselves
alone
in
*NL*
that
crowded
room
.
And
on
Vronsky
's
face
,
always
so
firm
and
*NL*
independent
,
she
saw
that
look
that
had
struck
her
,
of
bewilderment
and
*NL*
humble
submissiveness
,
like
the
expression
of
an
intelligent
dog
when
it
*NL*
has
done
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
smiled
,
and
her
smile
was
reflected
by
him
.
She
grew
thoughtful
,
*NL*
and
he
became
serious
.
Some
supernatural
force
drew
Kitty
's
eyes
to
*NL*
Anna
's
face
.
She
was
fascinating
in
her
simple
black
dress
,
fascinating
*NL*
were
her
round
arms
with
their
bracelets
,
fascinating
was
her
firm
neck
*NL*
with
its
thread
of
pearls
,
fascinating
the
straying
curls
of
her
loose
*NL*
hair
,
fascinating
the
graceful
,
light
movements
of
her
little
feet
and
*NL*
hands
,
fascinating
was
that
lovely
face
in
its
eagerness
,
but
there
was
*NL*
something
terrible
and
cruel
in
her
fascination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
admired
her
more
than
ever
,
and
more
and
more
acute
was
her
*NL*
suffering
.
Kitty
felt
overwhelmed
,
and
her
face
showed
it
.
When
Vronsky
*NL*
saw
her
,
coming
across
her
in
the
mazurka
,
he
did
not
at
once
recognize
*NL*
her
,
she
was
so
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delightful
ball
!
''
he
said
to
her
,
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
mazurka
,
repeating
a
complicated
figure
,
newly
*NL*
invented
by
Korsunsky
,
Anna
came
forward
into
the
center
of
the
circle
,
*NL*
chose
two
gentlemen
,
and
summoned
a
lady
and
Kitty
.
Kitty
gazed
at
her
*NL*
in
dismay
as
she
went
up
.
Anna
looked
at
her
with
drooping
eyelids
,
and
*NL*
smiled
,
pressing
her
hand
.
But
,
noticing
that
Kitty
only
responded
to
*NL*
her
smile
by
a
look
of
despair
and
amazement
,
she
turned
away
from
her
,
*NL*
and
began
gaily
talking
to
the
other
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
something
uncanny
,
devilish
and
fascinating
in
her
,
''
*NL*
Kitty
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
did
not
mean
to
stay
to
supper
,
but
the
master
of
the
house
began
*NL*
to
press
her
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
said
Korsunsky
,
drawing
her
bare
arm
under
*NL*
the
sleeve
of
his
dress
coat

such
an

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
moved
gradually
on
,
trying
to
draw
her
along
with
him
.
Their
host
*NL*
smiled
approvingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
going
to
stay
,
''
answered
Anna
,
smiling
,
but
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
smile
,
both
Korsunsky
and
the
master
of
the
house
saw
from
her
*NL*
resolute
tone
that
she
would
not
stay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
why
,
as
it
is
,
I
have
danced
more
at
your
ball
in
Moscow
than
I
*NL*
have
all
the
winter
in
Petersburg
,
''
said
Anna
,
looking
round
at
Vronsky
,
*NL*
who
stood
near
her
.
``
I
must
rest
a
little
before
my
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
certainly
going
tomorrow
then
?
''
asked
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
''
answered
Anna
,
as
it
were
wondering
at
the
boldness
*NL*
of
his
question
;
but
the
irrepressible
,
quivering
brilliance
of
her
eyes
*NL*
and
her
smile
set
him
on
fire
as
she
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Arkadyevna
did
not
stay
to
supper
,
but
went
home
.

*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
something
in
me
hateful
,
repulsive
,
''
thought
Levin
,
as
he
*NL*
came
away
from
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
,
and
walked
in
the
direction
of
his
*NL*
brother
's
lodgings
.
``
And
I
do
n't
get
on
with
other
people
.
Pride
,
they
*NL*
say
.
No
,
I
have
no
pride
.
If
I
had
any
pride
,
I
should
not
have
put
*NL*
myself
in
such
a
position
.
''
And
he
pictured
to
himself
Vronsky
,
happy
,
*NL*
good-natured
,
clever
,
and
self-possessed
,
certainly
never
placed
in
the
*NL*
awful
position
in
which
he
had
been
that
evening
.
``
Yes
,
she
was
bound
to
*NL*
choose
him
.
So
it
had
to
be
,
and
I
can
not
complain
of
anyone
or
*NL*
anything
.
I
am
myself
to
blame
.
What
right
had
I
to
imagine
she
would
*NL*
care
to
join
her
life
to
mine
?
Who
am
I
and
what
am
I
?
A
nobody
,
not
*NL*
wanted
by
any
one
,
nor
of
use
to
anybody
.
''
And
he
recalled
his
brother
*NL*
Nikolay
,
and
dwelt
with
pleasure
on
the
thought
of
him
.
``
Is
n't
he
right
*NL*
that
everything
in
the
world
is
base
and
loathsome
?
And
are
we
fair
in
*NL*
our
judgment
of
brother
Nikolay
?
Of
course
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
Prokofy
,
seeing
him
in
a
torn
cloak
and
tipsy
,
he
's
a
despicable
person
.
*NL*
But
I
know
him
differently
.
I
know
his
soul
,
and
know
that
we
are
like
*NL*
him
.
And
I
,
instead
of
going
to
seek
him
out
,
went
out
to
dinner
,
and
*NL*
came
here
.
''
Levin
walked
up
to
a
lamppost
,
read
his
brother
's
address
,
*NL*
which
was
in
his
pocketbook
,
and
called
a
sledge
.
All
the
long
way
to
*NL*
his
brother
's
,
Levin
vividly
recalled
all
the
facts
familiar
to
him
of
*NL*
his
brother
Nikolay
's
life
.
He
remembered
how
his
brother
,
while
at
the
*NL*
university
,
and
for
a
year
afterwards
,
had
,
in
spite
of
the
jeers
of
his
*NL*
companions
,
lived
like
a
monk
,
strictly
observing
all
religious
rites
,
*NL*
services
,
and
fasts
,
and
avoiding
every
sort
of
pleasure
,
especially
*NL*
women
.
And
afterwards
,
how
he
had
all
at
once
broken
out
:
he
had
*NL*
associated
with
the
most
horrible
people
,
and
rushed
into
the
most
*NL*
senseless
debauchery
.
He
remembered
later
the
scandal
over
a
boy
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
taken
from
the
country
to
bring
up
,
and
,
in
a
fit
of
rage
,
had
so
*NL*
violently
beaten
that
proceedings
were
brought
against
him
for
*NL*
unlawfully
wounding
.
Then
he
recalled
the
scandal
with
a
sharper
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
had
lost
money
,
and
given
a
promissory
note
,
and
against
whom
he
*NL*
had
himself
lodged
a
complaint
,
asserting
that
he
had
cheated
him
.
-LRB-
This
*NL*
was
the
money
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
paid
.
-RRB-
Then
he
remembered
how
he
had
*NL*
spent
a
night
in
the
lockup
for
disorderly
conduct
in
the
street
.
He
*NL*
remembered
the
shameful
proceedings
he
had
tried
to
get
up
against
his
*NL*
brother
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
accusing
him
of
not
having
paid
him
his
share
*NL*
of
his
mother
's
fortune
,
and
the
last
scandal
,
when
he
had
gone
to
a
*NL*
western
province
in
an
official
capacity
,
and
there
had
got
into
trouble
*NL*
for
assaulting
a
village
elder
...
It
was
all
horribly
disgusting
,
yet
*NL*
to
Levin
it
appeared
not
at
all
in
the
same
disgusting
light
as
it
*NL*
inevitably
would
to
those
who
did
not
know
Nikolay
,
did
not
know
all
his
*NL*
story
,
did
not
know
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
remembered
that
when
Nikolay
had
been
in
the
devout
stage
,
the
*NL*
period
of
fasts
and
monks
and
church
services
,
when
he
was
seeking
in
*NL*
religion
a
support
and
a
curb
for
his
passionate
temperament
,
everyone
,
*NL*
far
from
encouraging
him
,
had
jeered
at
him
,
and
he
,
too
,
with
the
*NL*
others
.
They
had
teased
him
,
called
him
Noah
and
Monk
;
and
,
when
he
had
*NL*
broken
out
,
no
one
had
helped
him
,
but
everyone
had
turned
away
from
him
*NL*
with
horror
and
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
that
,
in
spite
of
all
the
ugliness
of
his
life
,
his
brother
*NL*
Nikolay
,
in
his
soul
,
in
the
very
depths
of
his
soul
,
was
no
more
in
the
*NL*
wrong
than
the
people
who
despised
him
.
He
was
not
to
blame
for
having
*NL*
been
born
with
his
unbridled
temperament
and
his
somehow
limited
*NL*
intelligence
.
But
he
had
always
wanted
to
be
good
.
``
I
will
tell
him
*NL*
everything
,
without
reserve
,
and
I
will
make
him
speak
without
reserve
,
*NL*
too
,
and
I
'll
show
him
that
I
love
him
,
and
so
understand
him
,
''
Levin
*NL*
resolved
to
himself
,
as
,
towards
eleven
o'clock
,
he
reached
the
hotel
of
*NL*
which
he
had
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
top
,
12
and
13
,
''
the
porter
answered
Levin
's
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
to
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
No.
12
was
half
open
,
and
there
came
out
into
the
streak
of
*NL*
light
thick
fumes
of
cheap
,
poor
tobacco
,
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
,
*NL*
unknown
to
Levin
;
but
he
knew
at
once
that
his
brother
was
there
;
he
*NL*
heard
his
cough
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
in
the
door
,
the
unknown
voice
was
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
depends
with
how
much
judgment
and
knowledge
the
thing
's
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
looked
in
at
the
door
,
and
saw
that
the
speaker
was
a
*NL*
young
man
with
an
immense
shock
of
hair
,
wearing
a
Russian
jerkin
,
and
*NL*
that
a
pockmarked
woman
in
a
woolen
gown
,
without
collar
or
cuffs
,
was
*NL*
sitting
on
the
sofa
.
His
brother
was
not
to
be
seen
.
Konstantin
felt
a
*NL*
sharp
pang
at
his
heart
at
the
thought
of
the
strange
company
in
which
*NL*
his
brother
spent
his
life
.
No
one
had
heard
him
,
and
Konstantin
,
taking
*NL*
off
his
galoshes
,
listened
to
what
the
gentleman
in
the
jerkin
was
*NL*
saying
.
He
was
speaking
of
some
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
devil
flay
them
,
the
privileged
classes
,
''
his
brother
's
voice
*NL*
responded
,
with
a
cough
.
``
Masha
!
get
us
some
supper
and
some
wine
if
*NL*
there
's
any
left
;
or
else
go
and
get
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
rose
,
came
out
from
behind
the
screen
,
and
saw
Konstantin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
some
gentleman
,
Nikolay
Dmitrievitch
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
want
?
''
said
the
voice
of
Nikolay
Levin
,
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I
,
''
answered
Konstantin
Levin
,
coming
forward
into
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
_
I
_
?
''
Nikolay
's
voice
said
again
,
still
more
angrily
.
He
could
be
*NL*
heard
getting
up
hurriedly
,
stumbling
against
something
,
and
Levin
saw
,
*NL*
facing
him
in
the
doorway
,
the
big
,
scared
eyes
,
and
the
huge
,
thin
,
*NL*
stooping
figure
of
his
brother
,
so
familiar
,
and
yet
astonishing
in
its
*NL*
weirdness
and
sickliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
even
thinner
than
three
years
before
,
when
Konstantin
Levin
had
*NL*
seen
him
last
.
He
was
wearing
a
short
coat
,
and
his
hands
and
big
bones
*NL*
seemed
huger
than
ever
.
His
hair
had
grown
thinner
,
the
same
straight
*NL*
mustaches
hid
his
lips
,
the
same
eyes
gazed
strangely
and
naively
at
his
*NL*
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Kostya
!
''
he
exclaimed
suddenly
,
recognizing
his
brother
,
and
his
*NL*
eyes
lit
up
with
joy
.
But
the
same
second
he
looked
round
at
the
young
*NL*
man
,
and
gave
the
nervous
jerk
of
his
head
and
neck
that
Konstantin
knew
*NL*
so
well
,
as
if
his
neckband
hurt
him
;
and
a
quite
different
expression
,
*NL*
wild
,
suffering
,
and
cruel
,
rested
on
his
emaciated
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote
to
you
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
both
that
I
do
n't
know
you
and
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
know
you
.
What
is
it
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
at
all
the
same
as
Konstantin
had
been
fancying
him
.
The
*NL*
worst
and
most
tiresome
part
of
his
character
,
what
made
all
relations
*NL*
with
him
so
difficult
,
had
been
forgotten
by
Konstantin
Levin
when
he
*NL*
thought
of
him
,
and
now
,
when
he
saw
his
face
,
and
especially
that
*NL*
nervous
twitching
of
his
head
,
he
remembered
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
see
you
for
anything
,
''
he
answered
timidly
.
``
I
've
*NL*
simply
come
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
's
timidity
obviously
softened
Nikolay
.
His
lips
twitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
that
's
it
?
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
come
in
;
sit
down
.
Like
some
supper
?
*NL*
Masha
,
bring
supper
for
three
.
No
,
stop
a
minute
.
Do
you
know
who
this
*NL*
is
?
''
he
said
,
addressing
his
brother
,
and
indicating
the
gentleman
in
*NL*
the
jerkin
:
``
This
is
Mr.
Kritsky
,
my
friend
from
Kiev
,
a
very
remarkable
*NL*
man
.
He
's
persecuted
by
the
police
,
of
course
,
because
he
's
not
a
*NL*
scoundrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
looked
round
in
the
way
he
always
did
at
everyone
in
the
room
.
*NL*
Seeing
that
the
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
was
moving
to
go
,
he
*NL*
shouted
to
her
,
``
Wait
a
minute
,
I
said
.
''
And
with
the
inability
to
*NL*
express
himself
,
the
incoherence
that
Konstantin
knew
so
well
,
he
began
,
*NL*
with
another
look
round
at
everyone
,
to
tell
his
brother
Kritsky
's
*NL*
story
:
how
he
had
been
expelled
from
the
university
for
starting
a
*NL*
benefit
society
for
the
poor
students
and
Sunday
schools
;
and
how
he
had
*NL*
afterwards
been
a
teacher
in
a
peasant
school
,
and
how
he
had
been
*NL*
driven
out
of
that
too
,
and
had
afterwards
been
condemned
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
of
the
Kiev
university
?
''
said
Konstantin
Levin
to
Kritsky
,
to
*NL*
break
the
awkward
silence
that
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
of
Kiev
,
''
Kritsky
replied
angrily
,
his
face
darkening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
woman
,
''
Nikolay
Levin
interrupted
him
,
pointing
to
her
,
``
is
*NL*
the
partner
of
my
life
,
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
I
took
her
out
of
a
bad
*NL*
house
,
''
and
he
jerked
his
neck
saying
this
;
``
but
I
love
her
and
respect
*NL*
her
,
and
any
one
who
wants
to
know
me
,
''
he
added
,
raising
his
voice
and
*NL*
knitting
his
brows
,
``
I
beg
to
love
her
and
respect
her
.
She
's
just
the
*NL*
same
as
my
wife
,
just
the
same
.
So
now
you
know
whom
you
've
to
do
with
.
*NL*
And
if
you
think
you
're
lowering
yourself
,
well
,
here
's
the
floor
,
*NL*
there
's
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
his
eyes
traveled
inquiringly
over
all
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
I
should
be
lowering
myself
,
I
do
n't
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
Masha
,
tell
them
to
bring
supper
;
three
portions
,
spirits
and

wine

No

wait
a

No

it
does
n't
matter

Go
along

*NL*
``
So
you
see
,
''
pursued
Nikolay
Levin
,
painfully
wrinkling
his
forehead
*NL*
and
twitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
obviously
difficult
for
him
to
think
of
what
to
say
and
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
do
you
see
?
''
...
He
pointed
to
some
sort
of
iron
bars
,
fastened
*NL*
together
with
strings
,
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
room
.
``
Do
you
see
that
?

That
's
the
beginning

going
into

association

''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
scarcely
heard
him
.
He
looked
into
his
sickly
,
consumptive
*NL*
face
,
and
he
was
more
and
more
sorry
for
him
,
and
he
could
not
force
*NL*
himself
to
listen
to
what
his
brother
was
telling
him
about
the
*NL*
association
.
He
saw
that
this
association
was
a
mere
anchor
to
save
him
*NL*
from
self-contempt
.
Nikolay
Levin
went
on
talking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
capital
oppresses
the
laborer
.
The
laborers
with
us
,
the
*NL*
peasants
,
bear
all
the
burden
of
labor
,
and
are
so
placed
that
however
*NL*
much
they
work
they
ca
n't
escape
from
their
position
of
beasts
of
*NL*
burden
.
All
the
profits
of
labor
,
on
which
they
might
improve
their
*NL*
position
,
and
gain
leisure
for
themselves
,
and
after
that
education
,
all
*NL*
the
surplus
values
are
taken
from
them
by
the
capitalists
.
And
society
's
*NL*
so
constituted
that
the
harder
they
work
,
the
greater
the
profit
of
the
*NL*
merchants
and
landowners
,
while
they
stay
beasts
of
burden
to
the
end
.
*NL*
And
that
state
of
things
must
be
changed
,
''
he
finished
up
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
questioningly
at
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
said
Konstantin
,
looking
at
the
patch
of
red
that
had
*NL*
come
out
on
his
brother
's
projecting
cheek
bones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
we
're
founding
a
locksmiths
'
association
,
where
all
the
*NL*
production
and
profit
and
the
chief
instruments
of
production
will
be
in
*NL*
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
association
to
be
?
''
asked
Konstantin
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
village
of
Vozdrem
,
Kazan
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
in
a
village
?
In
the
villages
,
I
think
,
there
is
plenty
of
work
*NL*
as
it
is
.
Why
a
locksmiths
'
association
in
a
village
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Because
the
peasants
are
just
as
much
slaves
as
they
ever
were
,
*NL*
and
that
's
why
you
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
do
n't
like
people
to
try
and
*NL*
get
them
out
of
their
slavery
,
''
said
Nikolay
Levin
,
exasperated
by
the
*NL*
objection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
sighed
,
looking
meanwhile
about
the
cheerless
and
dirty
*NL*
room
.
This
sigh
seemed
to
exasperate
Nikolay
still
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
aristocratic
views

I
know
that
he
*NL*
applies
all
the
power
of
his
intellect
to
justify
existing
evils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
what
do
you
talk
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
for
?
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergey
Ivanovitch
?
I
'll
tell
you
what
for
!
''
Nikolay
Levin
shrieked
*NL*
suddenly
at
the
name
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
for
...
*NL*
But
what
's
the
use
of
talking
?
There
's
only
one
thing
...
What
did
you
*NL*
come
to
me
for
?
You
look
down
on
this
,
and
you
're
welcome
to
,
--
and
go
*NL*
away
,
in
God
's
name
go
away
!

he
shrieked
,
getting
up
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
``
And
go
away
,
and
go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
look
down
on
it
at

said
Konstantin
Levin
timidly
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
even
dispute
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Marya
Nikolaevna
came
back
.
Nikolay
Levin
looked
round
*NL*
angrily
at
her
.
She
went
quickly
to
him
,
and
whispered
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
well
;
I
've
grown
irritable
,
''
said
Nikolay
Levin
,
getting
calmer
*NL*
and
breathing
painfully
;
``
and
then
you
talk
to
me
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
and
his
article
.
It
's
such
rubbish
,
such
lying
,
such
self-deception
.
*NL*
What
can
a
man
write
of
justice
who
knows
nothing
of
it
?
Have
you
read
*NL*
his
article
?

he
asked
Kritsky
,
sitting
down
again
at
the
table
,
and
*NL*
moving
back
off
half
of
it
the
scattered
cigarettes
,
so
as
to
clear
a
*NL*
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
read
it

Kritsky
responded
gloomily
,
obviously
not
desiring
*NL*
to
enter
into
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
Nikolay
Levin
,
now
turning
with
exasperation
upon
*NL*
Kritsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
did
n't
see
the
use
of
wasting
my
time
over
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
excuse
me
,
how
did
you
know
it
would
be
wasting
your
time

That
*NL*
article
's
too
deep
for
many
people
--
that
's
to
say
it
's
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
But
with
me
,
it
's
another
thing
;
I
see
through
his
ideas
,

I
know
*NL*
where
its
weakness
lies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
was
mute
.
Kritsky
got
up
deliberately
and
reached
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
have
supper
?
All
right

good-bye
!
Come
round
tomorrow
with
*NL*
the
locksmith

''
*NL*
*NL*
Kritsky
had
hardly
gone
out
when
Nikolay
Levin
smiled
and
winked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
no
good
either

he
said
.
``
I
see

of
course

*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
instant
Kritsky
,
at
the
door
,
called
him
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
now
?
''
he
said
,
and
went
out
to
him
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
Left
alone
with
Marya
Nikolaevna
,
Levin
turned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
long
with
my
brother
?

he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

more
than
a
year

Nikolay
Dmitrievitch
's
health
has
become
very
*NL*
poor

Dmitrievitch
drinks
a
great
deal

she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
...
how
does
he
drink

*NL*
*NL*
``
Drinks
vodka

And

whispered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
said
,
looking
timidly
towards
the
doorway
,
where
Nikolay
*NL*
Levin
had
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
talking
about

he
said
,
knitting
his
brows
,
and
turning
*NL*
his
scared
eyes
from
one
to
the
other
.
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing

Konstantin
answered
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
do
n't
want
to
say
,
do
n't
.
Only
it
's
no
good
your
talking
to
*NL*
her
.
She
's
a
wench
,
and
you
're
a
gentleman

he
said
with
a
jerk
of
the
*NL*
neck
.
``
You
understand
everything

I
see
,
and
have
taken
stock
of
*NL*
everything

look
with
commiseration

my
shortcomings

he
began
*NL*
again
,
raising
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolay
Dmitrievitch

Nikolay
Dmitrievitch

whispered
Marya
*NL*
Nikolaevna
,
again
going
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

very
well

very
well

But
where
's
the
supper

Ah
,
here
it
is

*NL*
he
said
,
seeing
a
waiter
with
a
tray
.
``
Here

set
it
here
,
''
he
added
*NL*
angrily
,
and
promptly
seizing
the
vodka
,
he
poured
out
a
glassful
and
*NL*
drank
it
greedily
.
``
Like
a
drink
?
''
he
turned
to
his
brother
,
and
at
once
*NL*
became
better
humored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
enough
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
I
'm
glad
to
see
you

anyway

After

all

said

done

not

Come

have
a
drink

Tell
me
*NL*
what
you
're
doing

he
went
on
,
greedily
munching
a
piece
of
bread
,
and
*NL*
pouring
out
another
glassful
.
``
How
are
you
living
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
live
alone
in
the
country

as
I
used
to

I
'm
busy
looking
after
the
*NL*
land

answered
Konstantin
,
watching
with
horror
the
greediness
with
*NL*
which
his
brother
ate
and
drank
,
and
trying
to
conceal
that
he
noticed
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
married

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has

Konstantin
answered
,
reddening
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
For
me
now

everything
's
at
an
end

I
've
made
a
mess

life

But
this
I
've
said

I
say
still

that
if
my
share
had
been
*NL*
given
me
when
I
needed
it
,
my
whole
life
would
have
been
different

*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
made
haste
to
change
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
your
little
Vanya
's
with
me

a
clerk
in
the
countinghouse
*NL*
at
Pokrovskoe

*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
jerked
his
neck
,
and
sank
into
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

tell
me
what
's
going
on
at

Is
the
house
standing

still

the
birch
trees

our
schoolroom
?
And
Philip
the
gardener

*NL*
is
he
living

How
I
remember
the
arbor

the
seat
!
Now
mind
and
do
n't
*NL*
alter
anything
in

house

make
haste

get
married

make
*NL*
everything

it
used

be
again

Then
I
'll
come

see
you

your

wife
is
nice

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
come
to
me
now

Levin
.
``
How
nicely
we
would
arrange
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
come

see
you

should
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would

quite
independently

Yes

say
what
you
like

you
will
have
to
choose
between

him

said
,
looking
timidly
into
his
brother
's
face

*NL*
*NL*
This
timidity
touched
Konstantin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
hear
my
confession
of
faith
on
the
subject

I
tell
you
*NL*
that
in
your

with
Sergey
Ivanovitch
I
take
neither
side

You
're
*NL*
both
wrong

You
're
more
wrong
externally

inwardly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

ah

You
see

Nikolay
shouted
joyfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
personally
value
friendly
relations

you
more
because

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
could
not
say
that
he
valued
it
more
because
Nikolay
was
*NL*
unhappy
,
and
needed
affection
.
But
Nikolay
knew
that
this
was
just
what
*NL*
he
meant
to
say
,
and
scowling
he
took
up
the
vodka
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough

Nikolay
Dmitrievitch

said
Marya
Nikolaevna

stretching
out
*NL*
her
plump

bare
arm
towards
the
decanter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
!
Do
n't
insist

I
'll
beat
you

he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Nikolaevna
smiled
a
sweet
and
good-humored
smile
,
which
was
at
*NL*
once
reflected
on
Nikolay
's
face
,
and
she
took
the
bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
suppose
she
understands
nothing

said
Nikolay
.
``
She
*NL*
understands
it
all
better

any

Is
n't
it
true
there

something
good
and
sweet
in
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
never
before

Konstantin
said
to
her

for
the
sake
*NL*
of
saying
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
you
must
n't
be
polite
and
stiff
with
her

It
frightens
her

No
one

ever
spoke
to
her
so
but
the
justices

peace
who
tried
her
for
*NL*
trying
to
get
out
of
a
house
of
ill-fame

Mercy
on
us
,
the
senselessness
*NL*
in

he
cried
suddenly
.
``
These
new
institutions

*NL*
justices
of
the
peace

rural
councils

what
hideousness
it
all
is

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
enlarge
on
his
encounters
with
the
new
institutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
heard
him
,
and
the
disbelief
in
the
sense
of
all
public
*NL*
institutions
,
which
he
shared
with
him
,
and
often
expressed
,
was
*NL*
distasteful
to
him
now
from
his
brother
's
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
another
world
we
shall
understand
it
all

he
said
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
another
world

Ah

I
do
n't
like
that
other

I
do
n't
like
it

*NL*
he
said
,
letting
his
scared
eyes
rest
on
his
brother
's
eyes
.
``
Here
one
*NL*
would
think
that
to
get
out
of
all
the
baseness

the
mess

one

own
*NL*
and
other
people

,
would
be
a
good
thing
,
and
yet
I
'm
afraid
of
death

*NL*
awfully
afraid
of
death

He
shuddered
.
``
But
do
drink
something
.
Would
*NL*
you
like
some
champagne
?
Or
shall
we
go
somewhere

Let

go
to
the
*NL*
Gypsies
!
Do
you
know
I
have
got
so
fond
of
the
Gypsies
and
Russian
*NL*
songs

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
speech
had
begun
to
falter
,
and
he
passed
abruptly
from
one
subject
*NL*
to
another
.
Konstantin
with
the
help
of
Masha
persuaded
him
not
to
go
*NL*
out
anywhere
,
and
got
him
to
bed
hopelessly
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Masha
promised
to
write
to
Konstantin
in
case
of
need
,
and
to
persuade
*NL*
Nikolay
Levin
to
go
and
stay
with
his
brother

Chapter
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Konstantin
Levin
left
Moscow
,
and
towards
evening
he
*NL*
reached
home
.
On
the
journey
in
the
train
he
talked
to
his
neighbors
*NL*
about
politics
and
the
new
railways
,
and
,
just
as
in
Moscow
,
he
was
*NL*
overcome
by
a
sense
of
confusion
of
ideas
,
dissatisfaction
with
himself
,
*NL*
shame
of
something
or
other
.
But
when
he
got
out
at
his
own
station
,
*NL*
when
he
saw
his
one-eyed
coachman
,
Ignat
,
with
the
collar
of
his
coat
*NL*
turned
up
;
when
,
in
the
dim
light
reflected
by
the
station
fires
,
he
saw
*NL*
his
own
sledge
,
his
own
horses
with
their
tails
tied
up
,
in
their
*NL*
harness
trimmed
with
rings
and
tassels
;
when
the
coachman
Ignat
,
as
he
*NL*
put
in
his
luggage
,
told
him
the
village
news
,
that
the
contractor
had
*NL*
arrived
,
and
that
Pava
had
calved
,
--
he
felt
that
little
by
little
the
*NL*
confusion
was
clearing
up
,
and
the
shame
and
self-dissatisfaction
were
*NL*
passing
away
.
He
felt
this
at
the
mere
sight
of
Ignat
and
the
horses
;
*NL*
but
when
he
had
put
on
the
sheepskin
brought
for
him
,
had
sat
down
*NL*
wrapped
up
in
the
sledge
,
and
had
driven
off
pondering
on
the
work
that
*NL*
lay
before
him
in
the
village
,
and
staring
at
the
side-horse
,
that
had
*NL*
been
his
saddle-horse
,
past
his
prime
now
,
but
a
spirited
beast
from
the
*NL*
Don
,
he
began
to
see
what
had
happened
to
him
in
quite
a
different
*NL*
light
.
He
felt
himself
,
and
did
not
want
to
be
any
one
else
.
All
he
*NL*
wanted
now
was
to
be
better
than
before
.
In
the
first
place
he
resolved
*NL*
that
from
that
day
he
would
give
up
hoping
for
any
extraordinary
*NL*
happiness
,
such
as
marriage
must
have
given
him
,
and
consequently
he
*NL*
would
not
so
disdain
what
he
really
had
.
Secondly
,
he
would
never
again
*NL*
let
himself
give
way
to
low
passion
,
the
memory
of
which
had
so
tortured
*NL*
him
when
he
had
been
making
up
his
mind
to
make
an
offer
.
Then
*NL*
remembering
his
brother
Nikolay
,
he
resolved
to
himself
that
he
would
*NL*
never
allow
himself
to
forget
him
,
that
he
would
follow
him
up
,
and
not
*NL*
lose
sight
of
him
,
so
as
to
be
ready
to
help
when
things
should
go
ill
*NL*
with
him
.
And
that
would
be
soon
,
he
felt
.
Then
,
too
,
his
brother
's
talk
*NL*
of
communism
,
which
he
had
treated
so
lightly
at
the
time
,
now
made
him
*NL*
think
.
He
considered
a
revolution
in
economic
conditions
nonsense
.
But
*NL*
he
always
felt
the
injustice
of
his
own
abundance
in
comparison
with
the
*NL*
poverty
of
the
peasants
,
and
now
he
determined
that
so
as
to
feel
quite
*NL*
in
the
right
,
though
he
had
worked
hard
and
lived
by
no
means
*NL*
luxuriously
before
,
he
would
now
work
still
harder
,
and
would
allow
*NL*
himself
even
less
luxury
.
And
all
this
seemed
to
him
so
easy
a
conquest
*NL*
over
himself
that
he
spent
the
whole
drive
in
the
pleasantest
daydreams
.
*NL*
With
a
resolute
feeling
of
hope
in
a
new
,
better
life
,
he
reached
home
*NL*
before
nine
o'clock
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snow
of
the
little
quadrangle
before
the
house
was
lit
up
by
a
light
*NL*
in
the
bedroom
windows
of
his
old
nurse
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
who
performed
*NL*
the
duties
of
housekeeper
in
his
house
.
She
was
not
yet
asleep
.
Kouzma
,
*NL*
waked
up
by
her
,
came
sidling
sleepily
out
onto
the
steps
.
A
setter
*NL*
bitch
,
Laska
,
ran
out
too
,
almost
upsetting
Kouzma
,
and
whining
,
turned
*NL*
round
about
Levin
's
knees
,
jumping
up
and
longing
,
but
not
daring
,
to
*NL*
put
her
forepaws
on
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
soon
back
again
,
sir
,
''
said
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
tired
of
it
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
With
friends
,
one
is
well
;
but
at
*NL*
home
,
one
is
better
,
''
he
answered
,
and
went
into
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
study
was
slowly
lit
up
as
the
candle
was
brought
in
.
The
familiar
*NL*
details
came
out
:
the
stag
's
horns
,
the
bookshelves
,
the
looking-glass
,
*NL*
the
stove
with
its
ventilator
,
which
had
long
wanted
mending
,
his
*NL*
father
's
sofa
,
a
large
table
,
on
the
table
an
open
book
,
a
broken
ash
*NL*
tray
,
a
manuscript
book
with
his
handwriting
.
As
he
saw
all
this
,
there
*NL*
came
over
him
for
an
instant
a
doubt
of
the
possibility
of
arranging
the
*NL*
new
life
,
of
which
he
had
been
dreaming
on
the
road
.
All
these
traces
of
*NL*
his
life
seemed
to
clutch
him
,
and
to
say
to
him
:
``
No
,
you
're
not
going
*NL*
to
get
away
from
us
,
and
you
're
not
going
to
be
different
,
but
you
're
*NL*
going
to
be
the
same
as
you
've
always
been
;
with
doubts
,
everlasting
*NL*
dissatisfaction
with
yourself
,
vain
efforts
to
amend
,
and
falls
,
and
*NL*
everlasting
expectation
,
of
a
happiness
which
you
wo
n't
get
,
and
which
*NL*
is
n't
possible
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
the
things
said
to
him
,
but
another
voice
in
his
heart
was
telling
*NL*
him
that
he
must
not
fall
under
the
sway
of
the
past
,
and
that
one
can
*NL*
do
anything
with
oneself
.
And
hearing
that
voice
,
he
went
into
the
*NL*
corner
where
stood
his
two
heavy
dumbbells
,
and
began
brandishing
them
*NL*
like
a
gymnast
,
trying
to
restore
his
confident
temper
.
There
was
a
*NL*
creak
of
steps
at
the
door
.
He
hastily
put
down
the
dumbbells
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
came
in
,
and
said
everything
,
thank
God
,
was
doing
well
;
but
*NL*
informed
him
that
the
buckwheat
in
the
new
drying
machine
had
been
a
*NL*
little
scorched
.
This
piece
of
news
irritated
Levin
.
The
new
drying
*NL*
machine
had
been
constructed
and
partly
invented
by
Levin
.
The
bailiff
*NL*
had
always
been
against
the
drying
machine
,
and
now
it
was
with
*NL*
suppressed
triumph
that
he
announced
that
the
buckwheat
had
been
*NL*
scorched
.
Levin
was
firmly
convinced
that
if
the
buckwheat
had
been
*NL*
scorched
,
it
was
only
because
the
precautions
had
not
been
taken
,
for
*NL*
which
he
had
hundreds
of
times
given
orders
.
He
was
annoyed
,
and
*NL*
reprimanded
the
bailiff
.
But
there
had
been
an
important
and
joyful
*NL*
event
:
Pava
,
his
best
cow
,
an
expensive
beast
,
bought
at
a
show
,
had
*NL*
calved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kouzma
,
give
me
my
sheepskin
.
And
you
tell
them
to
take
a
lantern
.
I
'll
*NL*
come
and
look
at
her
,
''
he
said
to
the
bailiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cowhouse
for
the
more
valuable
cows
was
just
behind
the
house
.
*NL*
Walking
across
the
yard
,
passing
a
snowdrift
by
the
lilac
tree
,
he
went
*NL*
into
the
cowhouse
.
There
was
the
warm
,
steamy
smell
of
dung
when
the
*NL*
frozen
door
was
opened
,
and
the
cows
,
astonished
at
the
unfamiliar
light
*NL*
of
the
lantern
,
stirred
on
the
fresh
straw
.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
broad
,
smooth
,
black
and
piebald
back
of
Hollandka
.
Berkoot
,
the
bull
,
*NL*
was
lying
down
with
his
ring
in
his
lip
,
and
seemed
about
to
get
up
,
but
*NL*
thought
better
of
it
,
and
only
gave
two
snorts
as
they
passed
by
him
.
*NL*
Pava
,
a
perfect
beauty
,
huge
as
a
hippopotamus
,
with
her
back
turned
to
*NL*
them
,
prevented
their
seeing
the
calf
,
as
she
sniffed
her
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
into
the
pen
,
looked
Pava
over
,
and
lifted
the
red
and
*NL*
spotted
calf
onto
her
long
,
tottering
legs
.
Pava
,
uneasy
,
began
lowing
,
*NL*
but
when
Levin
put
the
calf
close
to
her
she
was
soothed
,
and
,
sighing
*NL*
heavily
,
began
licking
her
with
her
rough
tongue
.
The
calf
,
fumbling
,
*NL*
poked
her
nose
under
her
mother
's
udder
,
and
stiffened
her
tail
out
*NL*
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
bring
the
light
,
Fyodor
,
this
way
,
''
said
Levin
,
examining
the
*NL*
calf
.
``
Like
the
mother
!
though
the
color
takes
after
the
father
;
but
*NL*
that
's
nothing
.
Very
good
.
Long
and
broad
in
the
haunch
.
Vassily
*NL*
Fedorovitch
,
is
n't
she
splendid
?
''
he
said
to
the
bailiff
,
quite
*NL*
forgiving
him
for
the
buckwheat
under
the
influence
of
his
delight
in
*NL*
the
calf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
she
fail
to
be
?
Oh
,
Semyon
the
contractor
came
the
day
after
*NL*
you
left
.
You
must
settle
with
him
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
said
the
*NL*
bailiff
.
``
I
did
inform
you
about
the
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
was
enough
to
take
Levin
back
to
all
the
details
of
his
*NL*
work
on
the
estate
,
which
was
on
a
large
scale
,
and
complicated
.
He
went
*NL*
straight
from
the
cowhouse
to
the
counting
house
,
and
after
a
little
*NL*
conversation
with
the
bailiff
and
Semyon
the
contractor
,
he
went
back
to
*NL*
the
house
and
straight
upstairs
to
the
drawing
room
.

Chapter
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
big
and
old-fashioned
,
and
Levin
,
though
he
lived
alone
,
*NL*
had
the
whole
house
heated
and
used
.
He
knew
that
this
was
stupid
,
he
*NL*
knew
that
it
was
positively
not
right
,
and
contrary
to
his
present
new
*NL*
plans
,
but
this
house
was
a
whole
world
to
Levin
.
It
was
the
world
in
*NL*
which
his
father
and
mother
had
lived
and
died
.
They
had
lived
just
the
*NL*
life
that
to
Levin
seemed
the
ideal
of
perfection
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
dreamed
of
beginning
with
his
wife
,
his
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
scarcely
remembered
his
mother
.
His
conception
of
her
was
for
him
*NL*
a
sacred
memory
,
and
his
future
wife
was
bound
to
be
in
his
imagination
*NL*
a
repetition
of
that
exquisite
,
holy
ideal
of
a
woman
that
his
mother
*NL*
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
far
from
conceiving
of
love
for
woman
apart
from
marriage
that
*NL*
he
positively
pictured
to
himself
first
the
family
,
and
only
secondarily
*NL*
the
woman
who
would
give
him
a
family
.
His
ideas
of
marriage
were
,
*NL*
consequently
,
quite
unlike
those
of
the
great
majority
of
his
*NL*
acquaintances
,
for
whom
getting
married
was
one
of
the
numerous
facts
of
*NL*
social
life
.
For
Levin
it
was
the
chief
affair
of
life
,
on
which
its
*NL*
whole
happiness
turned
.
And
now
he
had
to
give
up
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
into
the
little
drawing
room
,
where
he
always
had
tea
,
*NL*
and
had
settled
himself
in
his
armchair
with
a
book
,
and
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
had
brought
him
tea
,
and
with
her
usual
,
``
Well
,
I
'll
stay
a
*NL*
while
,
sir
,
''
had
taken
a
chair
in
the
window
,
he
felt
that
,
however
*NL*
strange
it
might
be
,
he
had
not
parted
from
his
daydreams
,
and
that
he
*NL*
could
not
live
without
them
.
Whether
with
her
,
or
with
another
,
still
it
*NL*
would
be
.
He
was
reading
a
book
,
and
thinking
of
what
he
was
reading
,
*NL*
and
stopping
to
listen
to
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
who
gossiped
away
without
*NL*
flagging
,
and
yet
with
all
that
,
all
sorts
of
pictures
of
family
life
*NL*
and
work
in
the
future
rose
disconnectedly
before
his
imagination
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
in
the
depth
of
his
soul
something
had
been
put
in
its
place
,
*NL*
settled
down
,
and
laid
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
Agafea
Mihalovna
talking
of
how
Prohor
had
forgotten
his
duty
*NL*
to
God
,
and
with
the
money
Levin
had
given
him
to
buy
a
horse
,
had
been
*NL*
drinking
without
stopping
,
and
had
beaten
his
wife
till
he
'd
half
killed
*NL*
her
.
He
listened
,
and
read
his
book
,
and
recalled
the
whole
train
of
*NL*
ideas
suggested
by
his
reading
.
It
was
Tyndall
's
_
Treatise
on
Heat
_
.
He
*NL*
recalled
his
own
criticisms
of
Tyndall
of
his
complacent
satisfaction
in
*NL*
the
cleverness
of
his
experiments
,
and
for
his
lack
of
philosophic
*NL*
insight
.
And
suddenly
there
floated
into
his
mind
the
joyful
thought
:
*NL*
``
In
two
years
'
time
I
shall
have
two
Dutch
cows
;
Pava
herself
will
*NL*
perhaps
still
be
alive
,
a
dozen
young
daughters
of
Berkoot
and
the
three
*NL*
others
--
how
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
book
again
.
``
Very
good
,
electricity
and
heat
are
the
same
*NL*
thing
;
but
is
it
possible
to
substitute
the
one
quantity
for
the
other
*NL*
in
the
equation
for
the
solution
of
any
problem
?
No
.
Well
,
then
what
of
*NL*
it
?
The
connection
between
all
the
forces
of
nature
is
felt
*NL*
instinctively
...
It
's
particulary
nice
if
Pava
's
daughter
should
be
a
*NL*
red-spotted
cow
,
and
all
the
herd
will
take
after
her
,
and
the
other
*NL*
three
,
too
!
Splendid
!
To
go
out
with
my
wife
and
visitors
to
meet
the
*NL*
herd
...
My
wife
says
,
`
Kostya
and
I
looked
after
that
calf
like
a
*NL*
child
.
'
`
How
can
it
interest
you
so
much
?
'
says
a
visitor
.
`
Everything
*NL*
that
interests
him
,
interests
me
.
'
But
who
will
she
be
?
''
And
he
*NL*
remembered
what
had
happened
at
Moscow
...
``
Well
,
there
's
nothing
to
be
*NL*
done
...
It
's
not
my
fault
.
But
now
everything
shall
go
on
in
a
new
way
.
*NL*
It
's
nonsense
to
pretend
that
life
wo
n't
let
one
,
that
the
past
wo
n't
*NL*
let
one
.
One
must
struggle
to
live
better
,
much
better
.
''
...
He
raised
*NL*
his
head
,
and
fell
to
dreaming
.
Old
Laska
,
who
had
not
yet
fully
*NL*
digested
her
delight
at
his
return
,
and
had
run
out
into
the
yard
to
*NL*
bark
,
came
back
wagging
her
tail
,
and
crept
up
to
him
,
bringing
in
the
*NL*
scent
of
fresh
air
,
put
her
head
under
his
hand
,
and
whined
plaintively
,
*NL*
asking
to
be

``
There

who
'd
have
thought
it

said
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
``
The
dog
now

*NL*
why

she
understands
that

master

come
home

that

*NL*
low-spirited

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
low-spirited
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
see
it

sir

It
's
high
time
I
should
know
the
*NL*
gentry

Why
,
I
've
grown
up
from
a
little
thing
with
them

It
's
nothing

*NL*
sir

so
long
as
there
's
health

a
clear
conscience

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
intently
at
her
,
surprised
at
how
well
she
knew
his
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
fetch
you
another
cup
?
''
said
she
,
and
taking
his
cup
she
went
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laska
kept
poking
her
head
under
his
hand
.
He
stroked
her
,
and
she
*NL*
promptly
curled
up
at
his
feet
,
laying
her
head
on
a
hindpaw
.
And
in
*NL*
token
of
all
now
being
well
and
satisfactory
,
she
opened
her
mouth
a
*NL*
little
,
smacked
her
lips
,
and
settling
her
sticky
lips
more
comfortably
*NL*
about
her
old
teeth
,
she
sank
into
blissful
repose
.
Levin
watched
all
*NL*
her
movements
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
'll
do
,
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
that
's
what
I
'll
do

*NL*
Nothing
's
amiss

All
's
well

Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
ball
,
early
next
morning
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
sent
her
husband
a
*NL*
telegram
that
she
was
leaving
Moscow
the
same
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
must
go
,
I
must
go
''
;
she
explained
to
her
sister-in-law
the
*NL*
change
in
her
plans
in
a
tone
that
suggested
that
she
had
to
remember
so
*NL*
many
things
that
there
was
no
enumerating
them
:
``
no
,
it
had
really
*NL*
better
be
today
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
not
dining
at
home
,
but
he
promised
to
come
and
*NL*
see
his
sister
off
at
seven
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
,
too
,
did
not
come
,
sending
a
note
that
she
had
a
headache
.
Dolly
*NL*
and
Anna
dined
alone
with
the
children
and
the
English
governess
.
*NL*
Whether
it
was
that
the
children
were
fickle
,
or
that
they
had
acute
*NL*
senses
,
and
felt
that
Anna
was
quite
different
that
day
from
what
she
*NL*
had
been
when
they
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
her
,
that
she
was
not
now
*NL*
interested
in
them
,
--
but
they
had
abruptly
dropped
their
play
with
their
*NL*
aunt
,
and
their
love
for
her
,
and
were
quite
indifferent
that
she
was
*NL*
going
away
.
Anna
was
absorbed
the
whole
morning
in
preparations
for
her
*NL*
departure
.
She
wrote
notes
to
her
Moscow
acquaintances
,
put
down
her
*NL*
accounts
,
and
packed
.
Altogether
Dolly
fancied
she
was
not
in
a
placid
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
but
in
that
worried
mood
,
which
Dolly
knew
well
with
*NL*
herself
,
and
which
does
not
come
without
cause
,
and
for
the
most
part
*NL*
covers
dissatisfaction
with
self
.
After
dinner
,
Anna
went
up
to
her
room
*NL*
to
dress
,
and
Dolly
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
queer
you
are
today
!
''
Dolly
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Do
you
think
so
?
I
'm
not
queer
,
but
I
'm
nasty
.
I
am
like
that
*NL*
sometimes
.
I
keep
feeling
as
if
I
could
cry
.
It
's
very
stupid
,
but
it
'll
*NL*
pass
off
,
''
said
Anna
quickly
,
and
she
bent
her
flushed
face
over
a
tiny
*NL*
bag
in
which
she
was
packing
a
nightcap
and
some
cambric
handkerchiefs
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
particularly
bright
,
and
were
continually
swimming
with
*NL*
tears
.
``
In
the
same
way
I
did
n't
want
to
leave
Petersburg
,
and
now
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
go
away
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
here
and
did
a
good
deed
,
''
said
Dolly
,
looking
intently
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
looked
at
her
with
eyes
wet
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
,
Dolly
.
I
've
done
nothing
,
and
could
do
nothing
.
I
often
*NL*
wonder
why
people
are
all
in
league
to
spoil
me
.
What
have
I
done
,
and
*NL*
what
could
I
do
?
In
your
heart
there
was
found
love
enough
to
*NL*
forgive
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
not
been
for
you
,
God
knows
what
would
have
happened
!
How
*NL*
happy
you
are
,
Anna
!
''
said
Dolly
.
``
Everything
is
clear
and
good
in
your
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
heart
has
its
own
_
skeletons
_
,
as
the
English
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
no
sort
of
_
skeleton
_
,
have
you
?
Everything
is
so
clear
in
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
!
''
said
Anna
suddenly
,
and
,
unexpectedly
after
her
tears
,
a
sly
,
*NL*
ironical
smile
curved
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
he
's
amusing
,
anyway
,
your
_
skeleton
_
,
and
not
depressing
,
''
said
*NL*
Dolly
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
depressing
.
Do
you
know
why
I
'm
going
today
instead
of
*NL*
tomorrow
?
It
's
a
confession
that
weighs
on
me
;
I
want
to
make
it
to
*NL*
you
,
''
said
Anna
,
letting
herself
drop
definitely
into
an
armchair
,
and
*NL*
looking
straight
into
Dolly
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
her
surprise
Dolly
saw
that
Anna
was
blushing
up
to
her
ears
,
up
*NL*
to
the
curly
black
ringlets
on
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Anna
went
on
.
``
Do
you
know
why
Kitty
did
n't
come
to
dinner
?
She
's
*NL*
jealous
of
me
.
I
have
spoiled
...
I
've
been
the
cause
of
that
ball
being
*NL*
a
torture
to
her
instead
of
a
pleasure
.
But
truly
,
truly
,
it
's
not
my
*NL*
fault
,
or
only
my
fault
a
little
bit
,
''
she
said
,
daintily
drawling
the
*NL*
words
``
a
little
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
like
Stiva
you
said
that
!
''
said
Dolly
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
was
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
oh
no
!
I
'm
not
Stiva
,
''
she
said
,
knitting
her
brows
.
``
That
's
why
*NL*
I
'm
telling
you
,
just
because
I
could
never
let
myself
doubt
myself
for
*NL*
an
instant
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
very
moment
she
was
uttering
the
words
,
she
felt
that
they
*NL*
were
not
true
.
She
was
not
merely
doubting
herself
,
she
felt
emotion
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
Vronsky
,
and
was
going
away
sooner
than
she
had
meant
,
*NL*
simply
to
avoid
meeting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Stiva
told
me
you
danced
the
mazurka
with
him
,
and
that
he
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
imagine
how
absurdly
it
all
came
about
.
I
only
meant
to
be
*NL*
matchmaking
,
and
all
at
once
it
turned
out
quite
differently
.
Possibly
*NL*
against
my
own
will
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
crimsoned
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
feel
it
directly
?
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
should
be
in
despair
if
there
were
anything
serious
in
it
on
his
*NL*
side
,
''
Anna
interrupted
her
.
``
And
I
am
certain
it
will
all
be
forgotten
,
*NL*
and
Kitty
will
leave
off
hating
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
Anna
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
'm
not
very
anxious
for
*NL*
this
marriage
for
Kitty
.
And
it
's
better
it
should
come
to
nothing
,
if
*NL*
he
,
Vronsky
,
is
capable
of
falling
in
love
with
you
in
a
single
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
,
that
would
be
too
silly
!
''
said
Anna
,
and
again
a
deep
*NL*
flush
of
pleasure
came
out
on
her
face
,
when
she
heard
the
idea
,
that
*NL*
absorbed
her
,
put
into
words
.
``
And
so
here
I
am
going
away
,
having
made
*NL*
an
enemy
of
Kitty
,
whom
I
liked
so
much
!
Ah
,
how
sweet
she
is
!
But
*NL*
you
'll
make
it
right
,
Dolly
?
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
could
scarcely
suppress
a
smile
.
She
loved
Anna
,
but
she
enjoyed
*NL*
seeing
that
she
too
had
her
weaknesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
enemy
?
That
ca
n't
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
so
want
you
all
to
care
for
me
,
as
I
do
for
you
,
and
now
I
care
*NL*
for
you
more
than
ever
,
''
said
Anna
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
.
``
Ah
,
how
*NL*
silly
I
am
today
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
her
handkerchief
over
her
face
and
began
dressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
moment
of
starting
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
arrived
,
late
,
rosy
*NL*
and
good-humored
,
smelling
of
wine
and
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
's
emotionalism
infected
Dolly
,
and
when
she
embraced
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
for
the
last
time
,
she
whispered
:
``
Remember
,
Anna
,
what
*NL*
you
've
done
for
me
--
I
shall
never
forget

And
remember
that
I
love
you

and
shall
always
love
you
as
my
dearest
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
,
''
said
Anna
,
kissing
her
and
hiding
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understood
me
,
and
you
understand

Good-bye

my
darling

Chapter
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
it
's
all
over
,
and
thank
God
!
''
was
the
first
thought
that
came
to
*NL*
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
when
she
had
said
good-bye
for
the
last
time
to
her
*NL*
brother
,
who
had
stood
blocking
up
the
entrance
to
the
carriage
till
the
*NL*
third
bell
rang
.
She
sat
down
on
her
lounge
beside
Annushka
,
and
looked
*NL*
about
her
in
the
twilight
of
the
sleeping-carriage
.
``
Thank
God
!
tomorrow
*NL*
I
shall
see
Seryozha
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
my
life
will
go
on
*NL*
in
the
old
way
,
all
nice
and
as
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
in
the
same
anxious
frame
of
mind
,
as
she
had
been
all
that
day
,
*NL*
Anna
took
pleasure
in
arranging
herself
for
the
journey
with
great
care
.
*NL*
With
her
little
deft
hands
she
opened
and
shut
her
little
red
bag
,
took
*NL*
out
a
cushion
,
laid
it
on
her
knees
,
and
carefully
wrapping
up
her
feet
,
*NL*
settled
herself
comfortably
.
An
invalid
lady
had
already
lain
down
to
*NL*
sleep
.
Two
other
ladies
began
talking
to
Anna
,
and
a
stout
elderly
lady
*NL*
tucked
up
her
feet
,
and
made
observations
about
the
heating
of
the
*NL*
train
.
Anna
answered
a
few
words
,
but
not
foreseeing
any
entertainment
*NL*
from
the
conversation
,
she
asked
Annushka
to
get
a
lamp
,
hooked
it
onto
*NL*
the
arm
of
her
seat
,
and
took
from
her
bag
a
paper
knife
and
an
English
*NL*
novel
.
At
first
her
reading
made
no
progress
.
The
fuss
and
bustle
were
*NL*
disturbing
;
then
when
the
train
had
started
,
she
could
not
help
*NL*
listening
to
the
noises
;
then
the
snow
beating
on
the
left
window
and
*NL*
sticking
to
the
pane
,
and
the
sight
of
the
muffled
guard
passing
by
,
*NL*
covered
with
snow
on
one
side
,
and
the
conversations
about
the
terrible
*NL*
snowstorm
raging
outside
,
distracted
her
attention
.
Farther
on
,
it
was
*NL*
continually
the
same
again
and
again
:
the
same
shaking
and
rattling
,
the
*NL*
same
snow
on
the
window
,
the
same
rapid
transitions
from
steaming
heat
*NL*
to
cold
,
and
back
again
to
heat
,
the
same
passing
glimpses
of
the
same
*NL*
figures
in
the
twilight
,
and
the
same
voices
,
and
Anna
began
to
read
and
*NL*
to
understand
what
she
read
.
Annushka
was
already
dozing
,
the
red
bag
on
*NL*
her
lap
,
clutched
by
her
broad
hands
,
in
gloves
,
of
which
one
was
torn
.
*NL*
Anna
Arkadyevna
read
and
understood
,
but
it
was
distasteful
to
her
to
*NL*
read
,
that
is
,
to
follow
the
reflection
of
other
people
's
lives
.
She
had
*NL*
too
great
a
desire
to
live
herself
.
If
she
read
that
the
heroine
of
the
*NL*
novel
was
nursing
a
sick
man
,
she
longed
to
move
with
noiseless
steps
*NL*
about
the
room
of
a
sick
man
;
if
she
read
of
a
member
of
Parliament
*NL*
making
a
speech
,
she
longed
to
be
delivering
the
speech
;
if
she
read
of
*NL*
how
Lady
Mary
had
ridden
after
the
hounds
,
and
had
provoked
her
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
and
had
surprised
everyone
by
her
boldness
,
she
too
*NL*
wished
to
be
doing
the
same
.
But
there
was
no
chance
of
doing
anything
;
*NL*
and
twisting
the
smooth
paper
knife
in
her
little
hands
,
she
forced
*NL*
herself
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hero
of
the
novel
was
already
almost
reaching
his
English
happiness
,
*NL*
a
baronetcy
and
an
estate
,
and
Anna
was
feeling
a
desire
to
go
with
him
*NL*
to
the
estate
,
when
she
suddenly
felt
that
_
he
_
ought
to
feel
ashamed
,
*NL*
and
that
she
was
ashamed
of
the
same
thing
.
But
what
had
he
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
?
``
What
have
I
to
be
ashamed
of
?
''
she
asked
herself
in
injured
*NL*
surprise
.
She
laid
down
the
book
and
sank
against
the
back
of
the
chair
,
*NL*
tightly
gripping
the
paper
cutter
in
both
hands
.
There
was
nothing
.
She
*NL*
went
over
all
her
Moscow
recollections
.
All
were
good
,
pleasant
.
She
*NL*
remembered
the
ball
,
remembered
Vronsky
and
his
face
of
slavish
*NL*
adoration
,
remembered
all
her
conduct
with
him
:
there
was
nothing
*NL*
shameful
.
And
for
all
that
,
at
the
same
point
in
her
memories
,
the
*NL*
feeling
of
shame
was
intensified
,
as
though
some
inner
voice
,
just
at
*NL*
the
point
when
she
thought
of
Vronsky
,
were
saying
to
her
,
``
Warm
,
very
*NL*
warm
,
hot
.
''
``
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
she
said
to
herself
resolutely
,
shifting
*NL*
her
seat
in
the
lounge
.
``
What
does
it
mean
?
Am
I
afraid
to
look
it
*NL*
straight
in
the
face
?
Why
,
what
is
it
?
Can
it
be
that
between
me
and
*NL*
this
officer
boy
there
exist
,
or
can
exist
,
any
other
relations
than
*NL*
such
as
are
common
with
every
acquaintance
?
''
She
laughed
contemptuously
*NL*
and
took
up
her
book
again
;
but
now
she
was
definitely
unable
to
follow
*NL*
what
she
read
.
She
passed
the
paper
knife
over
the
window
pane
,
then
*NL*
laid
its
smooth
,
cool
surface
to
her
cheek
,
and
almost
laughed
aloud
at
*NL*
the
feeling
of
delight
that
all
at
once
without
cause
came
over
her
.
She
*NL*
felt
as
though
her
nerves
were
strings
being
strained
tighter
and
*NL*
tighter
on
some
sort
of
screwing
peg
.
She
felt
her
eyes
opening
wider
*NL*
and
wider
,
her
fingers
and
toes
twitching
nervously
,
something
within
*NL*
oppressing
her
breathing
,
while
all
shapes
and
sounds
seemed
in
the
*NL*
uncertain
half-light
to
strike
her
with
unaccustomed
vividness
.
Moments
*NL*
of
doubt
were
continually
coming
upon
her
,
when
she
was
uncertain
*NL*
whether
the
train
were
going
forwards
or
backwards
,
or
were
standing
*NL*
still
altogether
;
whether
it
were
Annushka
at
her
side
or
a
stranger
.
*NL*
``
What
's
that
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
,
a
fur
cloak
or
some
beast
?
And
*NL*
what
am
I
myself
?
Myself
or
some
other
woman
?
''
She
was
afraid
of
giving
*NL*
way
to
this
delirium
.
But
something
drew
her
towards
it
,
and
she
could
*NL*
yield
to
it
or
resist
it
at
will
.
She
got
up
to
rouse
herself
,
and
*NL*
slipped
off
her
plaid
and
the
cape
of
her
warm
dress
.
For
a
moment
she
*NL*
regained
her
self-possession
,
and
realized
that
the
thin
peasant
who
had
*NL*
come
in
wearing
a
long
overcoat
,
with
buttons
missing
from
it
,
was
the
*NL*
stoveheater
,
that
he
was
looking
at
the
thermometer
,
that
it
was
the
*NL*
wind
and
snow
bursting
in
after
him
at
the
door
;
but
then
everything
*NL*
grew
blurred
again
...
That
peasant
with
the
long
waist
seemed
to
be
*NL*
gnawing
something
on
the
wall
,
the
old
lady
began
stretching
her
legs
*NL*
the
whole
length
of
the
carriage
,
and
filling
it
with
a
black
cloud
;
*NL*
then
there
was
a
fearful
shrieking
and
banging
,
as
though
someone
were
*NL*
being
torn
to
pieces
;
then
there
was
a
blinding
dazzle
of
red
fire
*NL*
before
her
eyes
and
a
wall
seemed
to
rise
up
and
hide
everything
.
Anna
*NL*
felt
as
though
she
were
sinking
down
.
But
it
was
not
terrible
,
but
*NL*
delightful
.
The
voice
of
a
man
muffled
up
and
covered
with
snow
shouted
*NL*
something
in
her
ear
.
She
got
up
and
pulled
herself
together
;
she
*NL*
realized
that
they
had
reached
a
station
and
that
this
was
the
guard
.
*NL*
She
asked
Annushka
to
hand
her
the
cape
she
had
taken
off
and
her
shawl
,
*NL*
put
them
on
and
moved
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
get
out
?
''
asked
Annushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
want
a
little
air
.
It
's
very
hot
in
here
.
''
And
she
opened
the
*NL*
door
.
The
driving
snow
and
the
wind
rushed
to
meet
her
and
struggled
*NL*
with
her
over
the
door
.
But
she
enjoyed
the
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
the
door
and
went
out
.
The
wind
seemed
as
though
lying
in
*NL*
wait
for
her
;
with
gleeful
whistle
it
tried
to
snatch
her
up
and
bear
*NL*
her
off
,
but
she
clung
to
the
cold
door
post
,
and
holding
her
skirt
got
*NL*
down
onto
the
platform
and
under
the
shelter
of
the
carriages
.
The
wind
*NL*
had
been
powerful
on
the
steps
,
but
on
the
platform
,
under
the
lee
of
*NL*
the
carriages
,
there
was
a
lull
.
With
enjoyment
she
drew
deep
breaths
of
*NL*
the
frozen
,
snowy
air
,
and
standing
near
the
carriage
looked
about
the
*NL*
platform
and
the
lighted
station
.

The
raging
tempest
rushed
whistling
between
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
,
*NL*
about
the
scaffolding
,
and
round
the
corner
of
the
station
.
The
*NL*
carriages
,
posts
,
people
,
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
was
covered
*NL*
with
snow
on
one
side
,
and
was
getting
more
and
more
thickly
covered
.
*NL*
For
a
moment
there
would
come
a
lull
in
the
storm
,
but
then
it
would
*NL*
swoop
down
again
with
such
onslaughts
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
stand
*NL*
against
it
.
Meanwhile
men
ran
to
and
fro
,
talking
merrily
together
,
*NL*
their
steps
crackling
on
the
platform
as
they
continually
opened
and
*NL*
closed
the
big
doors
.
The
bent
shadow
of
a
man
glided
by
at
her
feet
,
*NL*
and
she
heard
sounds
of
a
hammer
upon
iron
.
``
Hand
over
that
telegram
!
''
*NL*
came
an
angry
voice
out
of
the
stormy
darkness
on
the
other
side
.
``
This
*NL*
way
!
No.
28
!
''
several
different
voices
shouted
again
,
and
muffled
*NL*
figures
ran
by
covered
with
snow
.
Two
gentlemen
with
lighted
cigarettes
*NL*
passed
by
her
.
She
drew
one
more
deep
breath
of
the
fresh
air
,
and
had
*NL*
just
put
her
hand
out
of
her
muff
to
take
hold
of
the
door
post
and
get
*NL*
back
into
the
carriage
,
when
another
man
in
a
military
overcoat
,
quite
*NL*
close
beside
her
,
stepped
between
her
and
the
flickering
light
of
the
*NL*
lamp
post
.
She
looked
round
,
and
the
same
instant
recognized
Vronsky
's
*NL*
face
.
Putting
his
hand
to
the
peak
of
his
cap
,
he
bowed
to
her
and
*NL*
asked
,
Was
there
anything
she
wanted
?
Could
he
be
of
any
service
to
her
?
*NL*
She
gazed
rather
a
long
while
at
him
without
answering
,
and
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
shadow
in
which
he
was
standing
,
she
saw
,
or
fancied
she
saw
,
both
*NL*
the
expression
of
his
face
and
his
eyes
.
It
was
again
that
expression
of
*NL*
reverential
ecstasy
which
had
so
worked
upon
her
the
day
before
.
More
*NL*
than
once
she
had
told
herself
during
the
past
few
days
,
and
again
only
*NL*
a
few
moments
before
,
that
Vronsky
was
for
her
only
one
of
the
hundreds
*NL*
of
young
men
,
forever
exactly
the
same
,
that
are
met
everywhere
,
that
*NL*
she
would
never
allow
herself
to
bestow
a
thought
upon
him
.
But
now
at
*NL*
the
first
instant
of
meeting
him
,
she
was
seized
by
a
feeling
of
joyful
*NL*
pride
.
She
had
no
need
to
ask
why
he
had
come
.
She
knew
as
certainly
as
*NL*
if
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
here
to
be
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
going
.
What
are
you
coming
for
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
letting
fall
the
hand
with
which
she
had
grasped
the
door
post
.
And
*NL*
irrepressible
delight
and
eagerness
shone
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
coming
for
?
''
he
repeated
,
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
You
know
that
I
have
come
to
be
where
you
are
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
wind
,
as
it
were
,
surmounting
all
obstacles
,
sent
the
*NL*
snow
flying
from
the
carriage
roofs
,
and
clanked
some
sheet
of
iron
it
*NL*
had
torn
off
,
while
the
hoarse
whistle
of
the
engine
roared
in
front
,
*NL*
plaintively
and
gloomily
.
All
the
awfulness
of
the
storm
seemed
to
her
*NL*
more
splendid
now
.
He
had
said
what
her
soul
longed
to
hear
,
though
she
*NL*
feared
it
with
her
reason
.
She
made
no
answer
,
and
in
her
face
he
saw
*NL*
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
if
you
dislike
what
I
said
,
''
he
said
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spoken
courteously
,
deferentially
,
yet
so
firmly
,
so
stubbornly
,
*NL*
that
for
a
long
while
she
could
make
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wrong
,
what
you
say
,
and
I
beg
you
,
if
you
're
a
good
man
,
to
*NL*
forget
what
you
've
said
,
as
I
forget
it
,
''
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
one
word
,
not
one
gesture
of
yours
shall
I
,
could
I
,
ever
*NL*
forget
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough
,
enough
!
''
she
cried
trying
assiduously
to
give
a
stern
*NL*
expression
to
her
face
,
into
which
he
was
gazing
greedily
.
And
clutching
*NL*
at
the
cold
door
post
,
she
clambered
up
the
steps
and
got
rapidly
into
*NL*
the
corridor
of
the
carriage
.
But
in
the
little
corridor
she
paused
,
*NL*
going
over
in
her
imagination
what
had
happened
.
Though
she
could
not
*NL*
recall
her
own
words
or
his
,
she
realized
instinctively
that
the
*NL*
momentary
conversation
had
brought
them
fearfully
closer
;
and
she
was
*NL*
panic-stricken
and
blissful
at
it
.
After
standing
still
a
few
seconds
,
*NL*
she
went
into
the
carriage
and
sat
down
in
her
place
.
The
overstrained
*NL*
condition
which
had
tormented
her
before
did
not
only
come
back
,
but
was
*NL*
intensified
,
and
reached
such
a
pitch
that
she
was
afraid
every
minute
*NL*
that
something
would
snap
within
her
from
the
excessive
tension
.
She
did
*NL*
not
sleep
all
night
.
But
in
that
nervous
tension
,
and
in
the
visions
*NL*
that
filled
her
imagination
,
there
was
nothing
disagreeable
or
gloomy
:
*NL*
on
the
contrary
there
was
something
blissful
,
glowing
,
and
exhilarating
.
*NL*
Towards
morning
Anna
sank
into
a
doze
,
sitting
in
her
place
,
and
when
*NL*
she
waked
it
was
daylight
and
the
train
was
near
Petersburg
.
At
once
*NL*
thoughts
of
home
,
of
husband
and
of
son
,
and
the
details
of
that
day
and
*NL*
the
following
came
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Petersburg
,
as
soon
as
the
train
stopped
and
she
got
out
,
the
first
*NL*
person
that
attracted
her
attention
was
her
husband
.
``
Oh
,
mercy
!
why
do
*NL*
his
ears
look
like
that
?
''
she
thought
,
looking
at
his
frigid
and
*NL*
imposing
figure
,
and
especially
the
ears
that
struck
her
at
the
moment
*NL*
as
propping
up
the
brim
of
his
round
hat
.
Catching
sight
of
her
,
he
came
*NL*
to
meet
her
,
his
lips
falling
into
their
habitual
sarcastic
smile
,
and
*NL*
his
big
,
tired
eyes
looking
straight
at
her
.
An
unpleasant
sensation
*NL*
gripped
at
her
heart
when
she
met
his
obstinate
and
weary
glance
,
as
*NL*
though
she
had
expected
to
see
him
different
.
She
was
especially
struck
*NL*
by
the
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
with
herself
that
she
experienced
on
*NL*
meeting
him
.
That
feeling
was
an
intimate
,
familiar
feeling
,
like
a
*NL*
consciousness
of
hypocrisy
,
which
she
experienced
in
her
relations
with
*NL*
her
husband
.
But
hitherto
she
had
not
taken
note
of
the
feeling
,
now
she
*NL*
was
clearly
and
painfully
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
as
you
see
,
your
tender
spouse
,
as
devoted
as
the
first
year
after
*NL*
marriage
,
burned
with
impatience
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
in
his
deliberate
,
*NL*
high-pitched
voice
,
and
in
that
tone
which
he
almost
always
took
with
*NL*
her
,
a
tone
of
jeering
at
anyone
who
should
say
in
earnest
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Seryozha
quite
well
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
this
all
the
reward
,
''
said
he
,
``
for
my
ardor
?
He
's
quite
*NL*
well
...

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
not
even
tried
to
sleep
all
that
night
.
He
sat
in
his
*NL*
armchair
,
looking
straight
before
him
or
scanning
the
people
who
got
in
*NL*
and
out
.
If
he
had
indeed
on
previous
occasions
struck
and
impressed
*NL*
people
who
did
not
know
him
by
his
air
of
unhesitating
composure
,
he
*NL*
seemed
now
more
haughty
and
self-possessed
than
ever
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
people
as
if
they
were
things
.
A
nervous
young
man
,
a
clerk
in
a
law
*NL*
court
,
sitting
opposite
him
,
hated
him
for
that
look
.
The
young
man
*NL*
asked
him
for
a
light
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
him
,
and
even
*NL*
pushed
against
him
,
to
make
him
feel
that
he
was
not
a
thing
,
but
a
*NL*
person
.
But
Vronsky
gazed
at
him
exactly
as
he
did
at
the
lamp
,
and
the
*NL*
young
man
made
a
wry
face
,
feeling
that
he
was
losing
his
*NL*
self-possession
under
the
oppression
of
this
refusal
to
recognize
him
as
*NL*
a
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
saw
nothing
and
no
one
.
He
felt
himself
a
king
,
not
because
he
*NL*
believed
that
he
had
made
an
impression
on
Anna
--
he
did
not
yet
believe
*NL*
that
,
--
but
because
the
impression
she
had
made
on
him
gave
him
happiness
*NL*
and
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
come
of
it
all
he
did
not
know
,
he
did
not
even
think
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
all
his
forces
,
hitherto
dissipated
,
wasted
,
were
centered
on
*NL*
one
thing
,
and
bent
with
fearful
energy
on
one
blissful
goal
.
And
he
was
*NL*
happy
at
it
.
He
knew
only
that
he
had
told
her
the
truth
,
that
he
had
*NL*
come
where
she
was
,
that
all
the
happiness
of
his
life
,
the
only
meaning
*NL*
in
life
for
him
,
now
lay
in
seeing
and
hearing
her
.
And
when
he
got
out
*NL*
of
the
carriage
at
Bologova
to
get
some
seltzer
water
,
and
caught
sight
*NL*
of
Anna
,
involuntarily
his
first
word
had
told
her
just
what
he
thought
.
*NL*
And
he
was
glad
he
had
told
her
it
,
that
she
knew
it
now
and
was
*NL*
thinking
of
it
.
He
did
not
sleep
all
night
.
When
he
was
back
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
he
kept
unceasingly
going
over
every
position
in
which
he
had
*NL*
seen
her
,
every
word
she
had
uttered
,
and
before
his
fancy
,
making
his
*NL*
heart
faint
with
emotion
,
floated
pictures
of
a
possible
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
out
of
the
train
at
Petersburg
,
he
felt
after
his
sleepless
*NL*
night
as
keen
and
fresh
as
after
a
cold
bath
.
He
paused
near
his
*NL*
compartment
,
waiting
for
her
to
get
out
.
``
Once
more
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
smiling
unconsciously
,
``
once
more
I
shall
see
her
walk
,
her
*NL*
face
;
she
will
say
something
,
turn
her
head
,
glance
,
smile
,
maybe
.
''
But
*NL*
before
he
caught
sight
of
her
,
he
saw
her
husband
,
whom
the
*NL*
station-master
was
deferentially
escorting
through
the
crowd
.
``
Ah
,
yes
!
*NL*
The
husband
.
''
Only
now
for
the
first
time
did
Vronsky
realize
clearly
*NL*
the
fact
that
there
was
a
person
attached
to
her
,
a
husband
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
she
had
a
husband
,
but
had
hardly
believed
in
his
existence
,
and
*NL*
only
now
fully
believed
in
him
,
with
his
head
and
shoulders
,
and
his
*NL*
legs
clad
in
black
trousers
;
especially
when
he
saw
this
husband
calmly
*NL*
take
her
arm
with
a
sense
of
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
with
his
Petersburg
face
and
severely
*NL*
self-confident
figure
,
in
his
round
hat
,
with
his
rather
prominent
*NL*
spine
,
he
believed
in
him
,
and
was
aware
of
a
disagreeable
sensation
,
*NL*
such
as
a
man
might
feel
tortured
by
thirst
,
who
,
on
reaching
a
spring
,
*NL*
should
find
a
dog
,
a
sheep
,
or
a
pig
,
who
has
drunk
of
it
and
muddied
*NL*
the
water
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
manner
of
walking
,
with
a
swing
of
*NL*
the
hips
and
flat
feet
,
particularly
annoyed
Vronsky
.
He
could
recognize
*NL*
in
no
one
but
himself
an
indubitable
right
to
love
her
.
But
she
was
*NL*
still
the
same
,
and
the
sight
of
her
affected
him
the
same
way
,
*NL*
physically
reviving
him
,
stirring
him
,
and
filling
his
soul
with
*NL*
rapture
.
He
told
his
German
valet
,
who
ran
up
to
him
from
the
second
*NL*
class
,
to
take
his
things
and
go
on
,
and
he
himself
went
up
to
her
.
He
*NL*
saw
the
first
meeting
between
the
husband
and
wife
,
and
noted
with
a
*NL*
lover
's
insight
the
signs
of
slight
reserve
with
which
she
spoke
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
``
No
,
she
does
not
love
him
and
can
not
love
him
,
''
he
decided
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
was
approaching
Anna
Arkadyevna
he
noticed
too
*NL*
with
joy
that
she
was
conscious
of
his
being
near
,
and
looked
round
,
and
*NL*
seeing
him
,
turned
again
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
passed
a
good
night
?
''
he
asked
,
bowing
to
her
and
her
husband
*NL*
together
,
and
leaving
it
up
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
to
accept
the
bow
*NL*
on
his
own
account
,
and
to
recognize
it
or
not
,
as
he
might
see
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
very
good
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
looked
weary
,
and
there
was
not
that
play
of
eagerness
in
it
,
*NL*
peeping
out
in
her
smile
and
her
eyes
;
but
for
a
single
instant
,
as
she
*NL*
glanced
at
him
,
there
was
a
flash
of
something
in
her
eyes
,
and
although
*NL*
the
flash
died
away
at
once
,
he
was
happy
for
that
moment
.
She
glanced
*NL*
at
her
husband
to
find
out
whether
he
knew
Vronsky
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
looked
at
Vronsky
with
displeasure
,
vaguely
recalling
who
*NL*
this
was
.
Vronsky
's
composure
and
self-confidence
here
struck
,
like
a
*NL*
scythe
against
a
stone
,
upon
the
cold
self-confidence
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Vronsky
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
We
are
acquainted
,
I
believe
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
indifferently
,
giving
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
set
off
with
the
mother
and
you
return
with
the
son
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
articulating
each
syllable
,
as
though
each
were
a
separate
favor
he
was
*NL*
bestowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
back
from
leave
,
I
suppose
?
''
he
said
,
and
without
waiting
for
a
*NL*
reply
,
he
turned
to
his
wife
in
his
jesting
tone
:
``
Well
,
were
a
great
*NL*
many
tears
shed
at
Moscow
at
parting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
addressing
his
wife
like
this
he
gave
Vronsky
to
understand
that
he
*NL*
wished
to
be
left
alone
,
and
,
turning
slightly
towards
him
,
he
touched
*NL*
his
hat
;
but
Vronsky
turned
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
may
have
the
honor
of
calling
on
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
glanced
with
his
weary
eyes
at
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
,
''
he
said
coldly
.
``
On
Mondays
we
're
at
home
.
Most
fortunate
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
his
wife
,
dismissing
Vronsky
altogether
,
``
that
I
should
just
*NL*
have
half
an
hour
to
meet
you
,
so
that
I
can
prove
my
devotion
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
in
the
same
jesting
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lay
too
much
stress
on
your
devotion
for
me
to
value
it
much
,
''
she
*NL*
responded
in
the
same
jesting
tone
,
involuntarily
listening
to
the
sound
*NL*
of
Vronsky
's
steps
behind
them
.
``
But
what
has
it
to
do
with
me
?
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
and
she
began
asking
her
husband
how
Seryozha
had
got
*NL*
on
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
capitally
!
Mariette
says
he
has
been
very
good
,
And
...
I
must
*NL*
disappoint
you
...
but
he
has
not
missed
you
as
your
husband
has
.
But
*NL*
once
more
_
merci
,
_
my
dear
,
for
giving
me
a
day
.
Our
dear
_
Samovar
_
will
*NL*
be
delighted
.
''
-LRB-
He
used
to
call
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
well
known
*NL*
in
society
,
a
samovar
,
because
she
was
always
bubbling
over
with
*NL*
excitement
.
-RRB-
``
She
has
been
continually
asking
after
you
.
And
,
do
you
*NL*
know
,
if
I
may
venture
to
advise
you
,
you
should
go
and
see
her
today
.
*NL*
You
know
how
she
takes
everything
to
heart
.
Just
now
,
with
all
her
own
*NL*
cares
,
she
's
anxious
about
the
Oblonskys
being
brought
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
a
friend
of
her
husband
's
,
and
the
*NL*
center
of
that
one
of
the
coteries
of
the
Petersburg
world
with
which
*NL*
Anna
was
,
through
her
husband
,
in
the
closest
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
I
wrote
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
she
'll
want
to
hear
details
.
Go
and
see
her
,
if
you
're
not
too
*NL*
tired
,
my
dear
.
Well
,
Kondraty
will
take
you
in
the
carriage
,
while
I
go
*NL*
to
my
committee
.
I
shall
not
be
alone
at
dinner
again
,
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
went
on
,
no
longer
in
a
sarcastic
tone
.
``
You
would
n't
*NL*
believe
how
I
've
missed
...
''
And
with
a
long
pressure
of
her
hand
and
a
*NL*
meaning
smile
,
he
put
her
in
her
carriage
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
to
meet
Anna
at
home
was
her
son
.
He
dashed
down
the
*NL*
stairs
to
her
,
in
spite
of
the
governess
's
call
,
and
with
desperate
joy
*NL*
shrieked
:
``
Mother
!
mother
!
''
Running
up
to
her
,
he
hung
on
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
it
was
mother
!
''
he
shouted
to
the
governess
.
``
I
knew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
her
son
,
like
her
husband
,
aroused
in
Anna
a
feeling
akin
to
*NL*
disappointment
.
She
had
imagined
him
better
than
he
was
in
reality
.
She
*NL*
had
to
let
herself
drop
down
to
the
reality
to
enjoy
him
as
he
really
*NL*
was
.
But
even
as
he
was
,
he
was
charming
,
with
his
fair
curls
,
his
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
and
his
plump
,
graceful
little
legs
in
tightly
pulled-up
*NL*
stockings
.
Anna
experienced
almost
physical
pleasure
in
the
sensation
of
*NL*
his
nearness
,
and
his
caresses
,
and
moral
soothing
,
when
she
met
his
*NL*
simple
,
confiding
,
and
loving
glance
,
and
heard
his
naive
questions
.
*NL*
Anna
took
out
the
presents
Dolly
's
children
had
sent
him
,
and
told
her
*NL*
son
what
sort
of
little
girl
was
Tanya
at
Moscow
,
and
how
Tanya
could
*NL*
read
,
and
even
taught
the
other
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
am
I
not
so
nice
as
she
?
''
asked
Seryozha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
me
you
're
nicer
than
anyone
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
,
''
said
Seryozha
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
not
had
time
to
drink
her
coffee
when
the
Countess
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
was
announced
.
The
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
a
tall
,
stout
*NL*
woman
,
with
an
unhealthily
sallow
face
and
splendid
,
pensive
black
eyes
.
*NL*
Anna
liked
her
,
but
today
she
seemed
to
be
seeing
her
for
the
first
time
*NL*
with
all
her
defects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
so
you
took
the
olive
branch
?
''
inquired
Countess
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
as
soon
as
she
came
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
over
,
but
it
was
all
much
less
serious
than
we
had
*NL*
supposed
,
''
answered
Anna
.
``
My
_
belle-soeur
_
is
in
general
too
hasty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
though
she
was
interested
in
everything
*NL*
that
did
not
concern
her
,
had
a
habit
of
never
listening
to
what
*NL*
interested
her
;
she
interrupted
Anna
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
plenty
of
sorrow
and
evil
in
the
world
.
I
am
so
worried
*NL*
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
?
''
asked
Anna
,
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
beginning
to
be
weary
of
fruitlessly
championing
the
truth
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
I
'm
quite
unhinged
by
it
.
The
Society
of
the
Little
Sisters
''
*NL*
-LRB-
this
was
a
religiously-patriotic
,
philanthropic
institution
-RRB-
``
was
going
*NL*
splendidly
,
but
with
these
gentlemen
it
's
impossible
to
do
anything
,
''
*NL*
added
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
in
a
tone
of
ironical
submission
to
*NL*
destiny
.
``
They
pounce
on
the
idea
,
and
distort
it
,
and
then
work
it
out
*NL*
so
pettily
and
unworthily
.
Two
or
three
people
,
your
husband
among
them
,
*NL*
understand
all
the
importance
of
the
thing
,
but
the
others
simply
drag
*NL*
it
down
.
Yesterday
Pravdin
wrote
to
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pravdin
was
a
well-known
Panslavist
abroad
,
and
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
*NL*
described
the
purport
of
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
countess
told
her
of
more
disagreements
and
intrigues
against
*NL*
the
work
of
the
unification
of
the
churches
,
and
departed
in
haste
,
as
*NL*
she
had
that
day
to
be
at
the
meeting
of
some
society
and
also
at
the
*NL*
Slavonic
committee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
all
the
same
before
,
of
course
;
but
why
was
it
I
did
n't
notice
*NL*
it
before
?
''
Anna
asked
herself
.
``
Or
has
she
been
very
much
irritated
*NL*
today
?
It
's
really
ludicrous
;
her
object
is
doing
good
;
she
a
Christian
,
*NL*
yet
she
's
always
angry
;
and
she
always
has
enemies
,
and
always
enemies
*NL*
in
the
name
of
Christianity
and
doing
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
another
friend
came
,
the
wife
of
a
chief
*NL*
secretary
,
who
told
her
all
the
news
of
the
town
.
At
three
o'clock
she
*NL*
too
went
away
,
promising
to
come
to
dinner
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
at
*NL*
the
ministry
.
Anna
,
left
alone
,
spent
the
time
till
dinner
in
assisting
*NL*
at
her
son
's
dinner
-LRB-
he
dined
apart
from
his
parents
-RRB-
and
in
putting
her
*NL*
things
in
order
,
and
in
reading
and
answering
the
notes
and
letters
*NL*
which
had
accumulated
on
her
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feeling
of
causeless
shame
,
which
she
had
felt
on
the
journey
,
and
*NL*
her
excitement
,
too
,
had
completely
vanished
.
In
the
habitual
conditions
*NL*
of
her
life
she
felt
again
resolute
and
irreproachable
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
with
wonder
her
state
of
mind
on
the
previous
day
.
``
What
*NL*
was
it
?
Nothing
.
Vronsky
said
something
silly
,
which
it
was
easy
to
put
*NL*
a
stop
to
,
and
I
answered
as
I
ought
to
have
done
.
To
speak
of
it
to
my
*NL*
husband
would
be
unnecessary
and
out
of
the
question
.
To
speak
of
it
*NL*
would
be
to
attach
importance
to
what
has
no
importance
.
''
She
remembered
*NL*
how
she
had
told
her
husband
of
what
was
almost
a
declaration
made
her
*NL*
at
Petersburg
by
a
young
man
,
one
of
her
husband
's
subordinates
,
and
how
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
answered
that
every
woman
living
in
the
world
*NL*
was
exposed
to
such
incidents
,
but
that
he
had
the

her

could
never
lower
her
and
himself
by
jealousy
.
``
So
then
*NL*
there
's
no

to
speak
of
it

And
indeed
,
thank
God

there
's
nothing
*NL*
to

of

told

*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
came
back
from
the
meeting
of
the
ministers
at
*NL*
four
o'clock
,
but
as
often
happened
,
he
had
not
time
to
come
in
to
her
.
*NL*
He
went
into
his
study
to
see
the
people
waiting
for
him
with
petitions
,
*NL*
and
to
sign
some
papers
brought
him
by
his
chief
secretary
.
At
dinner
*NL*
time
-LRB-
there
were
always
a
few
people
dining
with
the
Karenins
-RRB-
there
*NL*
arrived
an
old
lady
,
a
cousin
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
the
chief
*NL*
secretary
of
the
department
and
his
wife
,
and
a
young
man
who
had
been
*NL*
recommended
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
for
the
service
.
Anna
went
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
to
receive
these
guests
.
Precisely
at
five
o'clock
,
before
*NL*
the
bronze
Peter
the
First
clock
had
struck
the
fifth
stroke
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
came
in
,
wearing
a
white
tie
and
evening
coat
with
two
*NL*
stars
,
as
he
had
to
go
out
directly
after
dinner
.
Every
minute
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
life
was
portioned
out
and
occupied
.
And
to
make
time
*NL*
to
get
through
all
that
lay
before
him
every
day
,
he
adhered
to
the
*NL*
strictest
punctuality
.
``
Unhasting
and
unresting
,
''
was
his
motto
.
He
came
*NL*
into
the
dining
hall
,
greeted
everyone
,
and
hurriedly
sat
down
,
smiling
*NL*
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
solitude
is
over
.
You
would
n't
believe
how
uncomfortable
''
-LRB-
he
*NL*
laid
stress
on
the
word
_
uncomfortable
_
-RRB-
``
it
is
to
dine
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
he
talked
a
little
to
his
wife
about
Moscow
matters
,
and
,
with
*NL*
a
sarcastic
smile
,
asked
her
after
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
;
but
the
*NL*
conversation
was
for
the
most
part
general
,
dealing
with
Petersburg
*NL*
official
and
public
news
.
After
dinner
he
spent
half
an
hour
with
his
*NL*
guests
,
and
again
,
with
a
smile
,
pressed
his
wife
's
hand
,
withdrew
,
and
*NL*
drove
off
to
the
council
.
Anna
did
not
go
out
that
evening
either
to
the
*NL*
Princess
Betsy
Tverskaya
,
who
,
hearing
of
her
return
,
had
invited
her
,
*NL*
nor
to
the
theater
,
where
she
had
a
box
for
that
evening
.
She
did
not
go
*NL*
out
principally
because
the
dress
she
had
reckoned
upon
was
not
ready
.
*NL*
Altogether
,
Anna
,
on
turning
,
after
the
departure
of
her
guests
,
to
the
*NL*
consideration
of
her
attire
,
was
very
much
annoyed
.
She
was
generally
a
*NL*
mistress
of
the
art
of
dressing
well
without
great
expense
,
and
before
*NL*
leaving
Moscow
she
had
given
her
dressmaker
three
dresses
to
transform
.
*NL*
The
dresses
had
to
be
altered
so
that
they
could
not
be
recognized
,
and
*NL*
they
ought
to
have
been
ready
three
days
before
.
It
appeared
that
two
*NL*
dresses
had
not
been
done
at
all
,
while
the
other
one
had
not
been
*NL*
altered
as
Anna
had
intended
.
The
dressmaker
came
to
explain
,
declaring
*NL*
that
it
would
be
better
as
she
had
done
it
,
and
Anna
was
so
furious
that
*NL*
she
felt
ashamed
when
she
thought
of
it
afterwards
.
To
regain
her
*NL*
serenity
completely
she
went
into
the
nursery
,
and
spent
the
whole
*NL*
evening
with
her
son
,
put
him
to
bed
herself
,
signed
him
with
the
cross
,
*NL*
and
tucked
him
up
.
She
was
glad
she
had
not
gone
out
anywhere
,
and
had
*NL*
spent
the
evening
so
well
.
She
felt
so
light-hearted
and
serene
,
she
saw
*NL*
so
clearly
that
all
that
had
seemed
to
her
so
important
on
her
railway
*NL*
journey
was
only
one
of
the
common
trivial
incidents
of
fashionable
*NL*
life
,
and
that
she
had
no
reason
to
feel
ashamed
before
anyone
else
or
*NL*
before
herself
.
Anna
sat
down
at
the
hearth
with
an
English
novel
and
*NL*
waited
for
her
husband
.
Exactly
at
half-past
nine
she
heard
his
ring
,
*NL*
and
he
came
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
at
last
!
''
she
observed
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
hand
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altogether
then
,
I
see
your
visit
was
a
success
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
began
telling
him
about
everything
from
the
*NL*
beginning
:
her
journey
with
Countess
Vronskaya
,
her
arrival
,
the
*NL*
accident
at
the
station
.
Then
she
described
the
pity
she
had
felt
,
first
*NL*
for
her
brother
,
and
afterwards
for
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
one
can
not
exonerate
such
a
man
from
blame
,
though
he
is
your
*NL*
brother
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
smiled
.
She
knew
that
he
said
that
simply
to
show
that
family
*NL*
considerations
could
not
prevent
him
from
expressing
his
genuine
*NL*
opinion
.
She
knew
that
characteristic
in
her
husband
,
and
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
it
has
all
ended
so
satisfactorily
,
and
that
you
are
back
*NL*
again
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Come
,
what
do
they
say
about
the
new
act
I
have
got
*NL*
passed
in
the
council
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
heard
nothing
of
this
act
,
and
she
felt
conscience-stricken
at
*NL*
having
been
able
so
readily
to
forget
what
was
to
him
of
such
*NL*
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
on
the
other
hand
,
it
has
made
a
great
sensation
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
a
complacent
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
wanted
to
tell
her
something
pleasant
*NL*
to
him
about
it
,
and
she
brought
him
by
questions
to
telling
it
.
With
*NL*
the
same
complacent
smile
he
told
her
of
the
ovations
he
had
received
in
*NL*
consequence
of
the
act
he
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
,
very
glad
.
It
shows
that
at
last
a
reasonable
and
steady
*NL*
view
of
the
matter
is
becoming
prevalent
among
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
drunk
his
second
cup
of
tea
with
cream
,
and
bread
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
got
up
,
and
was
going
towards
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
not
been
anywhere
this
evening
?
You
've
been
dull
,
I
expect
?
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
she
answered
,
getting
up
after
him
and
accompanying
him
across
*NL*
the
room
to
his
study
.
``
What
are
you
reading
now
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
I
'm
reading
Duc
de
Lille
,
_
Poesie
des
Enfers
,
_
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
``
A
very
remarkable
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
smiled
,
as
people
smile
at
the
weaknesses
of
those
they
love
,
and
,
*NL*
putting
her
hand
under
his
,
she
escorted
him
to
the
door
of
the
study
.
*NL*
She
knew
his
habit
,
that
had
grown
into
a
necessity
,
of
reading
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
She
knew
,
too
,
that
in
spite
of
his
official
duties
,
which
*NL*
swallowed
up
almost
the
whole
of
his
time
,
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
*NL*
keep
up
with
everything
of
note
that
appeared
in
the
intellectual
world
.
*NL*
She
knew
,
too
,
that
he
was
really
interested
in
books
dealing
with
*NL*
politics
,
philosophy
,
and
theology
,
that
art
was
utterly
foreign
to
his
*NL*
nature
;
but
,
in
spite
of
this
,
or
rather
,
in
consequence
of
it
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
never
passed
over
anything
in
the
world
of
art
,
but
made
*NL*
it
his
duty
to
read
everything
.
She
knew
that
in
politics
,
in
*NL*
philosophy
,
in
theology
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
often
had
doubts
,
and
*NL*
made
investigations
;
but
on
questions
of
art
and
poetry
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
of
music
,
of
which
he
was
totally
devoid
of
understanding
,
he
had
the
*NL*
most
distinct
and
decided
opinions
.
He
was
fond
of
talking
about
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
Raphael
,
Beethoven
,
of
the
significance
of
new
schools
of
*NL*
poetry
and
music
,
all
of
which
were
classified
by
him
with
very
*NL*
conspicuous
consistency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
God
be
with
you
,
''
she
said
at
the
door
of
the
study
,
where
a
*NL*
shaded
candle
and
a
decanter
of
water
were
already
put
by
his
armchair
.
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
write
to
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
,
and
again
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
he
's
a
good
man
;
truthful
,
good-hearted
,
and
remarkable
in
*NL*
his
own
line
,
''
Anna
said
to
herself
going
back
to
her
room
,
as
though
*NL*
she
were
defending
him
to
someone
who
had
attacked
him
and
said
that
one
*NL*
could
not
love
him
.
``
But
why
is
it
his
ears
stick
out
so
strangely
?
Or
*NL*
has
he
had
his
hair
cut
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Precisely
at
twelve
o'clock
,
when
Anna
was
still
sitting
at
her
writing
*NL*
table
,
finishing
a
letter
to
Dolly
,
she
heard
the
sound
of
measured
*NL*
steps
in
slippers
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
freshly
washed
and
combed
,
*NL*
with
a
book
under
his
arm
,
came
in
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
,
it
's
time
,
''
said
he
,
with
a
meaning
smile
,
and
he
went
into
*NL*
their
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
right
had
he
to
look
at
him
like
that
?
''
thought
Anna
,
*NL*
recalling
Vronsky
's
glance
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undressing
,
she
went
into
the
bedroom
;
but
her
face
had
none
of
the
*NL*
eagerness
which
,
during
her
stay
in
Moscow
,
had
fairly
flashed
from
her
*NL*
eyes
and
her
smile
;
on
the
contrary
,
now
the
fire
seemed
quenched
in
*NL*
her
,
hidden
somewhere
far
away
.

Chapter
34
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Vronsky
went
to
Moscow
from
Petersburg
,
he
had
left
his
large
set
*NL*
of
rooms
in
Morskaia
to
his
friend
and
favorite
comrade
Petritsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petritsky
was
a
young
lieutenant
,
not
particularly
well-connected
,
and
*NL*
not
merely
not
wealthy
,
but
always
hopelessly
in
debt
.
Towards
evening
*NL*
he
was
always
drunk
,
and
he
had
often
been
locked
up
after
all
sorts
of
*NL*
ludicrous
and
disgraceful
scandals
,
but
he
was
a
favorite
both
of
his
*NL*
comrades
and
his
superior
officers
.
On
arriving
at
twelve
o'clock
from
*NL*
the
station
at
his
flat
,
Vronsky
saw
,
at
the
outer
door
,
a
hired
*NL*
carriage
familiar
to
him
.
While
still
outside
his
own
door
,
as
he
rang
,
*NL*
he
heard
masculine
laughter
,
the
lisp
of
a
feminine
voice
,
and
*NL*
Petritsky
's
voice
.
``
If
that
's
one
of
the
villains
,
do
n't
let
him
in
!
''
*NL*
Vronsky
told
the
servant
not
to
announce
him
,
and
slipped
quietly
into
*NL*
the
first
room
.
Baroness
Shilton
,
a
friend
of
Petritsky
's
,
with
a
rosy
*NL*
little
face
and
flaxen
hair
,
resplendent
in
a
lilac
satin
gown
,
and
*NL*
filling
the
whole
room
,
like
a
canary
,
with
her
Parisian
chatter
,
sat
at
*NL*
the
round
table
making
coffee
.
Petritsky
,
in
his
overcoat
,
and
the
*NL*
cavalry
captain
Kamerovsky
,
in
full
uniform
,
probably
just
come
from
*NL*
duty
,
were
sitting
each
side
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
Vronsky
!
''
shouted
Petritsky
,
jumping
up
,
scraping
his
chair
.
*NL*
``
Our
host
himself
!
Baroness
,
some
coffee
for
him
out
of
the
new
coffee
*NL*
pot
.
Why
,
we
did
n't
expect
you
!
Hope
you
're
satisfied
with
the
ornament
*NL*
of
your
study

he
said
,
indicating
the
baroness
.
``
You
know
each
other
,
*NL*
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
with
a
bright
smile
,
pressing
the
*NL*
baroness
's
little
hand
.
``
What
next
!
I
'm
an
old
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
home
after
a
journey

said
the
baroness
,
``
so
I
'm
flying

Oh

*NL*
I
'll
be
off
this
minute

the
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
home

wherever

said
Vronsky
.
``
How
do
you
do
,
*NL*
Kamerovsky
?
''
he
added
,
coldly
shaking
hands
with
Kamerovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
never
know
how
to
say
such
pretty
things
,
''
said
the
*NL*
baroness
,
turning
to
Petritsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
what
's
that
for
?
After
dinner
I
say
things
quite
as
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
dinner
there
's
no
credit
in
them
?
Well
,
then
,
I
'll
make
you
some
*NL*
coffee
,
so
go
and
wash
and
get
ready

''
said
the
baroness
,
sitting
down
*NL*
again
,
and
anxiously
turning
the
screw
in
the
new
coffee
pot
.
``
Pierre
,
*NL*
give
me
the
coffee
,
''
she
said
,
addressing
Petritsky
,
whom
she
called
*NL*
Pierre
as
a
contraction
of
his
surname
,
making
no
secret
of
her
*NL*
relations
with
him
.
``
I
'll
put
it
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
wo
n't
spoil

Well

and
your
wife

said
the
baroness
suddenly
,
*NL*
interrupting
Vronsky
's
conversation
with
his
comrade
.
``
We
've
been
*NL*
marrying

*NL*
*NL*
And
the
baroness
,
detaining
Vronsky
,
began
telling
him
,
with
many
jokes
,
*NL*
about
her
last
new
plans
of
life
,
asking
his
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
persists
in
refusing
to
give
me
a
divorce
!
Well
,
what
am
I
to
do

*NL*
-LRB-
_
He

was
her
husband

-RRB-
``
Now
I
want
to
begin
a

him

you

look
after
the

it

boiling

You
*NL*
see
,
I
'm
engrossed
with
business
!
I
want
a
lawsuit
,
because
I
must
have
*NL*
my
property

Do
you
understand
the
folly
of
it
,
that
on
the
pretext
of
*NL*
my
being
unfaithful
to
him
,
''
she
said
contemptuously
,
``
he
wants
to
get
*NL*
the
benefit
of
my
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
heard
with
pleasure
this
light-hearted
prattle
of
a
pretty
*NL*
woman
,
agreed
with
her
,
gave
her
half-joking
counsel
,
and
altogether
*NL*
dropped
at
once
into
the
tone
habitual
to
him
in
talking
to
such
women
.
*NL*
In
his
Petersburg
world
all
people
were
divided
into
utterly
opposed
*NL*
classes
.
One
,
the
lower
class
,
vulgar
,
stupid
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
ridiculous
people
,
who
believe
that
one
husband
ought
to
live
with
the
*NL*
one
wife
whom
he
has
lawfully
married
;
that
a
girl
should
be
innocent
,
a
*NL*
woman
modest
,
and
a
man
manly
,
self-controlled
,
and
strong
;
that
one
*NL*
ought
to
bring
up
one
's
children
,
earn
one
's
bread
,
and
pay
one
's
debts
;
*NL*
and
various
similar
absurdities
.
This
was
the
class
of
old-fashioned
and
*NL*
ridiculous
people
.
But
there
was
another
class
of
people
,
the
real
*NL*
people
.
To
this
class
they
all
belonged
,
and
in
it
the
great
thing
was
*NL*
to
be
elegant
,
generous
,
plucky
,
gay
,
to
abandon
oneself
without
a
blush
*NL*
to
every
passion
,
and
to
laugh
at
everything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
moment
only
,
Vronsky
was
startled
after
the
impression
of
*NL*
a
quite
different
world
that
he
had
brought
with
him
from
Moscow
.
But
*NL*
immediately
as
though
slipping
his
feet
into
old
slippers
,
he
dropped
*NL*
back
into
the
light-hearted
,
pleasant
world
he
had
always
lived
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffee
was
never
really
made
,
but
spluttered
over
every
one
,
and
*NL*
boiled
away
,
doing
just
what
was
required
of
it
--
that
is
,
providing
much
*NL*
cause
for
much
noise
and
laughter
,
and
spoiling
a
costly
rug
and
the
*NL*
baroness
's
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
good-bye
,
or
you
'll
never
get
washed
,
and
I
shall
have
on
my
*NL*
conscience
the
worst
sin
a
gentleman
can
commit
.
So
you
would
advise
a
*NL*
knife
to
his
throat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
and
manage
that
your
hand
may
not
be
far
from
his
lips
.
*NL*
He
'll
kiss
your
hand
,
and
all
will
end
satisfactorily
,

answered
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
at
the
Francais
!
''
and
,
with
a
rustle
of
her
skirts
,
she
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kamerovsky
got
up
too
,
and
Vronsky
,
not
waiting
for
him
to
go
,
shook
*NL*
hands
and
went
off
to
his
dressing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
washing
,
Petritsky
described
to
him
in
brief
outlines
his
*NL*
position
,
as
far
as
it
had
changed
since
Vronsky
had
left
Petersburg
.
No
*NL*
money
at
all
.
His
father
said
he
would
n't
give
him
any
and
pay
his
*NL*
debts
.
His
tailor
was
trying
to
get
him
locked
up
,
and
another
fellow
,
*NL*
too
,
was
threatening
to
get
him
locked
up
.
The
colonel
of
the
regiment
*NL*
had
announced
that
if
these
scandals
did
not
cease
he
would
have
to
*NL*
leave
.
As
for
the
baroness
,
he
was
sick
to
death
of
her
,
especially
*NL*
since
she
'd
taken
to
offering
continually
to
lend
him
money
.
But
he
had
*NL*
found
a
girl
--
he
'd
show
her
to
Vronsky
--
a
marvel
,
exquisite
,
in
the
*NL*
strict
Oriental
style
,
``
genre
of
the
slave
Rebecca
,
do
n't
you
know
.
''
*NL*
He
'd
had
a
row
,
too
,
with
Berkoshov
,
and
was
going
to
send
seconds
to
*NL*
him
,
but
of
course
it
would
come
to
nothing
.
Altogether
everything
was
*NL*
supremely
amusing
and
jolly
.
And
,
not
letting
his
comrade
enter
into
*NL*
further
details
of
his
position
,
Petritsky
proceeded
to
tell
him
all
the
*NL*
interesting
news
.
As
he
listened
to
Petritsky
's
familiar
stories
in
the
*NL*
familiar
setting
of
the
rooms
he
had
spent
the
last
three
years
in
,
*NL*
Vronsky
felt
a
delightful
sense
of
coming
back
to
the
careless
*NL*
Petersburg
life
that
he
was
used
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
he
cried
,
letting
down
the
pedal
of
the
washing
basin
in
*NL*
which
he
had
been
sousing
his
healthy
red
neck
.
``
Impossible
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
at
the
news
that
Laura
had
flung
over
Fertinghof
and
had
made
up
to
*NL*
Mileev
.
``
And
is
he
as
stupid
and
pleased
as
ever
?
Well
,
and
how
's
*NL*
Buzulukov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
is
a
tale
about
Buzulukov
--
simply
lovely
!
''
cried
Petritsky
.
*NL*
``
You
know
his
weakness
for
balls
,
and
he
never
misses
a
single
court
*NL*
ball

He
went
to
a
big
ball
in
a
new
helmet
.
Have
you
seen
the
new
*NL*
helmets
?
Very
nice
,
lighter

Well

so
he
's
standing
...
No

I
say
,
do
*NL*
listen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
listening

''
answered
Vronsky
,
rubbing
himself
with
a
rough
towel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
comes
the
Grand
Duchess
with
some
ambassador
or
other
,
and
,
as
*NL*
ill-luck
would
have
it

she
begins
talking
to
him
about
the
new
helmets
.
*NL*
The
Grand
Duchess
positively
wanted
to
show
the
new
helmet
to
the
*NL*
ambassador

They
see
our
friend
standing
there

-LRB-
Petritsky
mimicked
how
*NL*
he
was
standing
with
the
helmet
.
-RRB-
``
The
Grand
Duchess
asked
him
to
give
*NL*
her
the
helmet
;
he
does
n't
give
it
to
her

What
do
you
think
of
that
?
*NL*
Well
,
every
one
's
winking
at
him
,
nodding
,
frowning
--
give
it
to
her

do

*NL*
He
does
n't
give
it
to
her

He
's
mute
as

He
pulls

from

*NL*
hands
it
to
the
Grand
Duchess

She
turned
the

side
up

just
picture

plop
went
a
pear
and
sweetmeats
out
of
it

two
pounds
of

sweetmeats

He

been
storing
them
up

the
darling

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
.
And
long
afterwards
,
when
he
was
*NL*
talking
of
other
things
,
he
broke
out
into
his
healthy
laugh
,
showing
*NL*
his
strong
,
close
rows
of
teeth
,
when
he
thought
of
the
helmet

*NL*
*NL*
Having
heard
all
the
news
,
Vronsky
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
valet
,
*NL*
got
into
his
uniform
,
and
went
off
to
report
himself
.
He
intended
,
when
*NL*
he
had
done
that
,
to
drive
to
his
brother

several
visits
with
a
view
to
beginning
to
go
into
that
society
where

As

PART

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
winter
,
in
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
,
a
consultation
*NL*
was
being
held
,
which
was
to
pronounce
on
the
state
of
Kitty
's
health
*NL*
and
the
measures
to
be
taken
to
restore
her
failing
strength
.
She
had
*NL*
been
ill
,
and
as
spring
came
on
she
grew
worse
.
The
family
doctor
gave
*NL*
her
cod
liver
oil
,
then
iron
,
then
nitrate
of
silver
,
but
as
the
first
*NL*
and
the
second
and
the
third
were
alike
in
doing
no
good
,
and
as
his
*NL*
advice
when
spring
came
was
to
go
abroad
,
a
celebrated
physician
was
*NL*
called
in
.
The
celebrated
physician
,
a
very
handsome
man
,
still
*NL*
youngish
,
asked
to
examine
the
patient
.
He
maintained
,
with
peculiar
*NL*
satisfaction
,
it
seemed
,
that
maiden
modesty
is
a
mere
relic
of
*NL*
barbarism
,
and
that
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
for
a
man
still
*NL*
youngish
to
handle
a
young
girl
naked
.
He
thought
it
natural
because
he
*NL*
did
it
every
day
,
and
felt
and
thought
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
no
harm
as
*NL*
he
did
it
and
consequently
he
considered
modesty
in
the
girl
not
merely
*NL*
as
a
relic
of
barbarism
,
but
also
as
an
insult
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
,
since
,
although
all
the
doctors
*NL*
had
studied
in
the
same
school
,
had
read
the
same
books
,
and
learned
the
*NL*
same
science
,
and
though
some
people
said
this
celebrated
doctor
was
a
*NL*
bad
doctor
,
in
the
princess
's
household
and
circle
it
was
for
some
*NL*
reason
accepted
that
this
celebrated
doctor
alone
had
some
special
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
that
he
alone
could
save
Kitty
.
After
a
careful
*NL*
examination
and
sounding
of
the
bewildered
patient
,
dazed
with
shame
,
*NL*
the
celebrated
doctor
,
having
scrupulously
washed
his
hands
,
was
*NL*
standing
in
the
drawing
room
talking
to
the
prince
.
The
prince
frowned
*NL*
and
coughed
,
listening
to
the
doctor
.
As
a
man
who
had
seen
something
of
*NL*
life
,
and
neither
a
fool
nor
an
invalid
,
he
had
no
faith
in
medicine
,
*NL*
and
in
his
heart
was
furious
at
the
whole
farce
,
specially
as
he
was
*NL*
perhaps
the
only
one
who
fully
comprehended
the
cause
of
Kitty
's
*NL*
illness
.
``
Conceited
blockhead
!
''
he
thought
,
as
he
listened
to
the
*NL*
celebrated
doctor
's
chatter
about
his
daughter
's
symptoms
.
The
doctor
*NL*
was
meantime
with
difficulty
restraining
the
expression
of
his
contempt
*NL*
for
this
old
gentleman
,
and
with
difficulty
condescending
to
the
level
*NL*
of
his
intelligence
.
He
perceived
that
it
was
no
good
talking
to
the
old
*NL*
man
,
and
that
the
principal
person
in
the
house
was
the
mother
.
Before
*NL*
her
he
decided
to
scatter
his
pearls
.
At
that
instant
the
princess
came
*NL*
into
the
drawing
room
with
the
family
doctor
.
The
prince
withdrew
,
*NL*
trying
not
to
show
how
ridiculous
he
thought
the
whole
performance
.
The
*NL*
princess
was
distracted
,
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
She
felt
she
had
*NL*
sinned
against
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
doctor
,
decide
our
fate
,
''
said
the
princess
.
``
Tell
me
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
hope
?
''
she
meant
to
say
,
but
her
lips
quivered
,
and
she
could
*NL*
not
utter
the
question
.
``
Well
,
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
princess
.
I
will
talk
it
over
with
my
colleague
,
and
then
*NL*
I
will
have
the
honor
of
laying
my
opinion
before
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
had
better
leave
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
went
out
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
doctors
were
left
alone
,
the
family
doctor
began
timidly
*NL*
explaining
his
opinion
,
that
there
was
a
commencement
of
tuberculous
*NL*
trouble
,
but
...
and
so
on
.
The
celebrated
doctor
listened
to
him
,
and
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
looked
at
his
big
gold
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
But
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
doctor
respectfully
ceased
in
the
middle
of
his
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
commencement
of
the
tuberculous
process
we
are
not
,
as
you
are
*NL*
aware
,
able
to
define
;
till
there
are
cavities
,
there
is
nothing
*NL*
definite
.
But
we
may
suspect
it
.
And
there
are
indications
;
*NL*
malnutrition
,
nervous
excitability
,
and
so
on
.
The
question
stands
thus
:
*NL*
in
presence
of
indications
of
tuberculous
process
,
what
is
to
be
done
to
*NL*
maintain
nutrition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
you
know
,
there
are
always
moral
,
spiritual
causes
at
the
back
in
*NL*
these
cases
,
''
the
family
doctor
permitted
himself
to
interpolate
with
a
*NL*
subtle
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
an
understood
thing
,
''
responded
the
celebrated
physician
,
*NL*
again
glancing
at
his
watch
.
``
Beg
pardon
,
is
the
Yausky
bridge
done
yet
,
*NL*
or
shall
I
have
to
drive
around
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Ah
!
it
is
.
Oh
,
well
,
then
I
*NL*
can
do
it
in
twenty
minutes
.
So
we
were
saying
the
problem
may
be
put
*NL*
thus
:
to
maintain
nutrition
and
to
give
tone
to
the
nerves
.
The
one
is
*NL*
in
close
connection
with
the
other
,
one
must
attack
both
sides
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
about
a
tour
abroad
?
''
asked
the
family
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
liking
for
foreign
tours
.
And
take
note
:
if
there
is
an
early
*NL*
stage
of
tuberculous
process
,
of
which
we
can
not
be
certain
,
a
foreign
*NL*
tour
will
be
of
no
use
.
What
is
wanted
is
means
of
improving
nutrition
,
*NL*
and
not
for
lowering
it
.
''
And
the
celebrated
doctor
expounded
his
plan
*NL*
of
treatment
with
Soden
waters
,
a
remedy
obviously
prescribed
primarily
*NL*
on
the
ground
that
they
could
do
no
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
doctor
listened
attentively
and
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
favor
of
foreign
travel
I
would
urge
the
change
of
habits
,
the
*NL*
removal
from
conditions
calling
up
reminiscences
.
And
then
the
mother
*NL*
wishes
it
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Well
,
in
that
case
,
to
be
sure
,
let
them
go
.
Only
,
those
German
*NL*
quacks
are
mischievous
...
They
ought
to
be
persuaded
...
Well
,
let
them
*NL*
go
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
once
more
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
time
's
up
already
,
''
And
he
went
to
the
door
.
The
celebrated
doctor
*NL*
announced
to
the
princess
-LRB-
a
feeling
of
what
was
due
from
him
dictated
*NL*
his
doing
so
-RRB-
that
he
ought
to
see
the
patient
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
another
examination
!
''
cried
the
mother
,
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
only
a
few
details
,
princess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
mother
,
accompanied
by
the
doctor
,
went
into
the
drawing
room
to
*NL*
Kitty
.
Wasted
and
flushed
,
with
a
peculiar
glitter
in
her
eyes
,
left
*NL*
there
by
the
agony
of
shame
she
had
been
put
through
,
Kitty
stood
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
.
When
the
doctor
came
in
she
flushed
crimson
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
All
her
illness
and
treatment
struck
her
as
a
*NL*
thing
so
stupid
,
ludicrous
even
!
Doctoring
her
seemed
to
her
as
absurd
*NL*
as
putting
together
the
pieces
of
a
broken
vase
.
Her
heart
was
broken
.
*NL*
Why
would
they
try
to
cure
her
with
pills
and
powders
?
But
she
could
not
*NL*
grieve
her
mother
,
especially
as
her
mother
considered
herself
to
blame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
trouble
you
to
sit
down
,
princess
?
''
the
celebrated
doctor
said
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
with
a
smile
,
facing
her
,
felt
her
pulse
,
and
again
began
*NL*
asking
her
tiresome
questions
.
She
answered
him
,
and
all
at
once
got
up
,
*NL*
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
doctor
,
but
there
is
really
no
object
in
this
.
This
is
the
*NL*
third
time
you
've
asked
me
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
celebrated
doctor
did
not
take
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nervous
irritability
,
''
he
said
to
the
princess
,
when
Kitty
had
left
the
*NL*
room
.
``
However
,
I
had
finished
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
doctor
began
scientifically
explaining
to
the
princess
,
as
an
*NL*
exceptionally
intelligent
woman
,
the
condition
of
the
young
princess
,
*NL*
and
concluded
by
insisting
on
the
drinking
of
the
waters
,
which
were
*NL*
certainly
harmless
.
At
the
question
:
Should
they
go
abroad
?
the
doctor
*NL*
plunged
into
deep
meditation
,
as
though
resolving
a
weighty
problem
.
*NL*
Finally
his
decision
was
pronounced
:
they
were
to
go
abroad
,
but
to
put
*NL*
no
faith
in
foreign
quacks
,
and
to
apply
to
him
in
any
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
though
some
piece
of
good
fortune
had
come
to
pass
after
*NL*
the
doctor
had
gone
.
The
mother
was
much
more
cheerful
when
she
went
*NL*
back
to
her
daughter
,
and
Kitty
pretended
to
be
more
cheerful
.
She
had
*NL*
often
,
almost
always
,
to
be
pretending
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
'm
quite
well
,
mamma
.
But
if
you
want
to
go
abroad
,
let
's
go
!
''
*NL*
she
said
,
and
trying
to
appear
interested
in
the
proposed
tour
,
she
*NL*
began
talking
of
the
preparations
for
the
journey
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
doctor
,
Dolly
had
arrived
.
She
knew
that
there
was
to
be
*NL*
a
consultation
that
day
,
and
though
she
was
only
just
up
after
her
*NL*
confinement
-LRB-
she
had
another
baby
,
a
little
girl
,
born
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
winter
-RRB-
,
though
she
had
trouble
and
anxiety
enough
of
her
own
,
she
had
*NL*
left
her
tiny
baby
and
a
sick
child
,
to
come
and
hear
Kitty
's
fate
,
*NL*
which
was
to
be
decided
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
?
''
she
said
,
coming
into
the
drawing
room
,
without
taking
off
*NL*
her
hat
.
``
You
're
all
in
good
spirits
.
Good
news
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
tried
to
tell
her
what
the
doctor
had
said
,
but
it
appeared
that
*NL*
though
the
doctor
had
talked
distinctly
enough
and
at
great
length
,
it
*NL*
was
utterly
impossible
to
report
what
he
had
said
.
The
only
point
of
*NL*
interest
was
that
it
was
settled
they
should
go
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
could
not
help
sighing
.
Her
dearest
friend
,
her
sister
,
was
going
*NL*
away
.
And
her
life
was
not
a
cheerful
one
.
Her
relations
with
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
after
their
reconciliation
had
become
humiliating
.
The
*NL*
union
Anna
had
cemented
turned
out
to
be
of
no
solid
character
,
and
*NL*
family
harmony
was
breaking
down
again
at
the
same
point
.
There
had
been
*NL*
nothing
definite
,
but
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
hardly
ever
at
home
;
*NL*
money
,
too
,
was
hardly
ever
forthcoming
,
and
Dolly
was
continually
*NL*
tortured
by
suspicions
of
infidelity
,
which
she
tried
to
dismiss
,
*NL*
dreading
the
agonies
of
jealousy
she
had
been
through
already
.
The
first
*NL*
onslaught
of
jealousy
,
once
lived
through
,
could
never
come
back
again
,
*NL*
and
even
the
discovery
of
infidelities
could
never
now
affect
her
as
it
*NL*
had
the
first
time
.
Such
a
discovery
now
would
only
mean
breaking
up
*NL*
family
habits
,
and
she
let
herself
be
deceived
,
despising
him
and
still
*NL*
more
herself
,
for
the
weakness
.
Besides
this
,
the
care
of
her
large
*NL*
family
was
a
constant
worry
to
her
:
first
,
the
nursing
of
her
young
baby
*NL*
did
not
go
well
,
then
the
nurse
had
gone
away
,
now
one
of
the
children
*NL*
had
fallen
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
all
of
you
?
''
asked
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
mamma
,
we
have
plenty
of
troubles
of
our
own
.
Lili
is
ill
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
it
's
scarlatina
.
I
have
come
here
now
to
hear
about
Kitty
,
and
*NL*
then
I
shall
shut
myself
up
entirely
,
if
--
God
forbid
--
it
should
be
*NL*
scarlatina
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
too
had
come
in
from
his
study
after
the
doctor
's
*NL*
departure
,
and
after
presenting
his
cheek
to
Dolly
,
and
saying
a
few
*NL*
words
to
her
,
he
turned
to
his
wife
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
settled
it
?
you
're
going
?
Well
,
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
*NL*
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
had
better
stay
here
,
Alexander
,
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
why
should
n't
father
come
with
us
?
''
said
Kitty
.
``
It
would
be
*NL*
nicer
for
him
and
for
us
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
got
up
and
stroked
Kitty
's
hair
.
She
lifted
her
head
and
*NL*
looked
at
him
with
a
forced
smile
.
It
always
seemed
to
her
that
he
*NL*
understood
her
better
than
anyone
in
the
family
,
though
he
did
not
say
*NL*
much
about
her
.
Being
the
youngest
,
she
was
her
father
's
favorite
,
and
*NL*
she
fancied
that
his
love
gave
him
insight
.
When
now
her
glance
met
his
*NL*
blue
kindly
eyes
looking
intently
at
her
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
saw
*NL*
right
through
her
,
and
understood
all
that
was
not
good
that
was
passing
*NL*
within
her
.
Reddening
,
she
stretched
out
towards
him
expecting
a
kiss
,
*NL*
but
he
only
patted
her
hair
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
stupid
chignons
!
There
's
no
getting
at
the
real
daughter
.
One
*NL*
simply
strokes
the
bristles
of
dead
women
.
Well
,
Dolinka
,
''
he
turned
to
*NL*
his
elder
daughter
,
``
what
's
your
young
buck
about
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
father
,
''
answered
Dolly
,
understanding
that
her
husband
was
*NL*
meant
.
``
He
's
always
out
;
I
scarcely
ever
see
him
,
''
she
could
not
resist
*NL*
adding
with
a
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
has
n't
he
gone
into
the
country
yet
--
to
see
about
selling
that
*NL*
forest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
still
getting
ready
for
the
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
it
!
''
said
the
prince
.
``
And
so
am
I
to
be
getting
ready
for
a
*NL*
journey
too
?
At
your
service
,
''
he
said
to
his
wife
,
sitting
down
.
``
And
I
*NL*
tell
you
what
,
Katia
,
''
he
went
on
to
his
younger
daughter
,
``
you
must
*NL*
wake
up
one
fine
day
and
say
to
yourself
:
Why
,
I
'm
quite
well
,
and
*NL*
merry
,
and
going
out
again
with
father
for
an
early
morning
walk
in
the
*NL*
frost
.
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
her
father
said
seemed
simple
enough
,
yet
at
these
words
Kitty
*NL*
became
confused
and
overcome
like
a
detected
criminal
.
``
Yes
,
he
sees
it
*NL*
all
,
he
understands
it
all
,
and
in
these
words
he
's
telling
me
that
*NL*
though
I
'm
ashamed
,
I
must
get
over
my
shame
.
''
She
could
not
pluck
up
*NL*
spirit
to
make
any
answer
.
She
tried
to
begin
,
and
all
at
once
burst
*NL*
into
tears
,
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
what
comes
of
your
jokes
!
''
the
princess
pounced
down
on
her
*NL*
husband
.
``
You
're
always
...
''
she
began
a
string
of
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
listened
to
the
princess
's
scolding
rather
a
long
while
*NL*
without
speaking
,
but
his
face
was
more
and
more
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
so
much
to
be
pitied
,
poor
child
,
so
much
to
be
pitied
,
and
you
*NL*
do
n't
feel
how
it
hurts
her
to
hear
the
slightest
reference
to
the
cause
*NL*
of
it
.
Ah
!
to
be
so
mistaken
in
people
!
''
said
the
princess
,
and
by
the
*NL*
change
in
her
tone
both
Dolly
and
the
prince
knew
she
was
speaking
of
*NL*
Vronsky
.
``
I
do
n't
know
why
there
are
n't
laws
against
such
base
,
*NL*
dishonorable
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
ca
n't
bear
to
hear
you
!
''
said
the
prince
gloomily
,
getting
up
*NL*
from
his
low
chair
,
and
seeming
anxious
to
get
away
,
yet
stopping
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
``
There
are
laws
,
madam
,
and
since
you
've
challenged
me
to
it
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
who
's
to
blame
for
it
all
:
you
and
you
,
you
and
nobody
*NL*
else
.
Laws
against
such
young
gallants
there
have
always
been
,
and
there
*NL*
still
are
!
Yes
,
if
there
has
been
nothing
that
ought
not
to
have
been
,
*NL*
old
as
I
am
,
I
'd
have
called
him
out
to
the
barrier
,
the
young
dandy
.
*NL*
Yes
,
and
now
you
physic
her
and
call
in
these
quacks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
apparently
had
plenty
more
to
say
,
but
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
princess
heard
his
tone
she
subsided
at
once
,
and
became
penitent
,
as
*NL*
she
always
did
on
serious
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexander
,
Alexander
,
''
she
whispered
,
moving
to
him
and
beginning
to
*NL*
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
began
to
cry
the
prince
too
calmed
down
.
He
went
up
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
that
's
enough
,
that
's
enough
!
You
're
wretched
too
,
I
know
.
It
*NL*
ca
n't
be
helped
.
There
's
no
great
harm
done
.
God
is
merciful
...
*NL*
thanks
...
''
he
said
,
not
knowing
what
he
was
saying
,
as
he
responded
to
*NL*
the
tearful
kiss
of
the
princess
that
he
felt
on
his
hand
.
And
the
*NL*
prince
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
this
,
as
soon
as
Kitty
went
out
of
the
room
in
tears
,
Dolly
,
with
*NL*
her
motherly
,
family
instincts
,
had
promptly
perceived
that
here
a
*NL*
woman
's
work
lay
before
her
,
and
she
prepared
to
do
it
.
She
took
off
her
*NL*
hat
,
and
,
morally
speaking
,
tucked
up
her
sleeves
and
prepared
for
*NL*
action
.
While
her
mother
was
attacking
her
father
,
she
tried
to
restrain
*NL*
her
mother
,
so
far
as
filial
reverence
would
allow
.
During
the
prince
's
*NL*
outburst
she
was
silent
;
she
felt
ashamed
for
her
mother
,
and
tender
*NL*
towards
her
father
for
so
quickly
being
kind
again
.
But
when
her
father
*NL*
left
them
she
made
ready
for
what
was
the
chief
thing
needful
--
to
go
to
*NL*
Kitty
and
console
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
been
meaning
to
tell
you
something
for
a
long
while
,
mamma
:
did
you
*NL*
know
that
Levin
meant
to
make
Kitty
an
offer
when
he
was
here
the
last
*NL*
time
?
He
told
Stiva
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
I
do
n't
understand
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
did
Kitty
perhaps
refuse
him
?
...
She
did
n't
tell
you
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
has
said
nothing

me
either
of
one
or
the
other
;
she
's
too
*NL*
proud
.
But
I
know
it
's
all
on
account
of
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
suppose
she
has
refused
Levin
,
and
she
would
n't
have
refused
*NL*
him
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
other
,
I
know
.
And
then
,
he
has
deceived
*NL*
her
so
horribly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
too
terrible
for
the
princess
to
think
how
she
had
sinned
against
*NL*
her
daughter
,
and
she
broke
out
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
really
do
n't
understand
!
Nowadays
they
will
all
go
their
own
way

mothers
have
n't
a
word
to
say
in
anything

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

I
'll
go
up

*NL*
*NL*

Well

When
she
went
into
Kitty
's
little
room
,
a
pretty
,
pink
little
room
,
full
*NL*
of
knick-knacks
in
_
vieux
saxe
,
_
as
fresh
,
and
pink
,
and
white
,
and
gay
*NL*
as
Kitty
herself
had
been
two
months
ago
,
Dolly
remembered
how
they
had
*NL*
decorated
the
room
the
year
before
together
,
with
what
love
and
gaiety
.
*NL*
Her
heart
turned
cold
when
she
saw
Kitty
sitting
on
a
low
chair
near
the
*NL*
door
,
her
eyes
fixed
immovably
on
a
corner
of
the
rug
.
Kitty
glanced
at
*NL*
her
sister
,
and
the
cold
,
rather
ill-tempered
expression
of
her
face
did
*NL*
not
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
just
going
now
,
and
I
shall
have
to
keep
in
and
you
wo
n't
be
able
*NL*
to
come
to
see
me
,
''
said
Dolly
,
sitting
down
beside
her
.
``
I
want
to
talk
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
?
''
Kitty
asked
swiftly
,
lifting
her
head
in
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
it
be
,
but
your
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
Kitty
.
Do
you
suppose
I
could
help
knowing
?
I
know
all
about
*NL*
it
.
And
believe
me
,
it
's
of
so
little
consequence
...
We
've
all
been
*NL*
through
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
did
not
speak
,
and
her
face
had
a
stern
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
worth
your
grieving
over
him
,
''
pursued
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
coming
straight
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
because
he
has
treated
me
with
contempt
,
''
said
Kitty
,
in
a
breaking
*NL*
voice
.
``
Do
n't
talk
of
it
!
Please
,
do
n't
talk
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
can
have
told
you
so
?
No
one
has
said
that
.
I
'm
certain
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
you
,
and
would
still
be
in
love
with
you
,
if
it
had
n't
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
most
awful
thing
of
all
for
me
is
this
sympathizing
!
''
shrieked
*NL*
Kitty
,
suddenly
flying
into
a
passion
.
She
turned
round
on
her
chair
,
*NL*
flushed
crimson
,
and
rapidly
moving
her
fingers
,
pinched
the
clasp
of
*NL*
her
belt
first
with
one
hand
and
then
with
the
other
.
Dolly
knew
this
*NL*
trick
her
sister
had
of
clenching
her
hands
when
she
was
much
excited
;
*NL*
she
knew
,
too
,
that
in
moments
of
excitement
Kitty
was
capable
of
*NL*
forgetting
herself
and
saying
a
great
deal
too
much
,
and
Dolly
would
*NL*
have
soothed
her
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
is
it
you
want
to
make
me
feel
,
eh
?
''
said
Kitty
quickly
.
*NL*
``
That
I
've
been
in
love
with
a
man
who
did
n't
care
a
straw
for
me
,
and
*NL*
that
I
'm
dying
of
love
for
him
?
And
this
is
said
to
me
by
my
own
sister
,
*NL*
who
imagines
that
...
that
...
that
she
's
sympathizing
with
me
!
...
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
these
condolences
and
humbug
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
you
're
unjust
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
tormenting
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
...
quite
the
contrary
...
I
see
you
're
unhappy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kitty
in
her
fury
did
not
hear
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
nothing
to
grieve
over
and
be
comforted
about
.
I
am
too
proud
ever
*NL*
to
allow
myself
to
care
for
a
man
who
does
not
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
n't
say
so
either
...
Only
one
thing
.
Tell
me
the
truth
,
''
said
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
:
``
tell
me
,
did
Levin
speak
to
*NL*
you
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mention
of
Levin
's
name
seemed
to
deprive
Kitty
of
the
last
vestige
*NL*
of
self-control
.
She
leaped
up
from
her
chair
,
and
flinging
her
clasp
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
she
gesticulated
rapidly
with
her
hands
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
bring
Levin
in
too
?
I
ca
n't
understand
what
you
want
to
torment
me
*NL*
for
.
I
've
told
you
,
and
I
say
it
again
,
that
I
have
some
pride
,
and
*NL*
never
,
_
never
_
would
I
do
as
you
're
doing
--
go
back
to
a
man
who
's
*NL*
deceived
you
,
who
has
cared
for
another
woman
.
I
ca
n't
understand
it
!
*NL*
You
may
,
but
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
saying
these
words
she
glanced
at
her
sister
,
and
seeing
that
Dolly
*NL*
sat
silent
,
her
head
mournfully
bowed
,
Kitty
,
instead
of
running
out
of
*NL*
the
room
as
she
had
meant
to
do
,
sat
down
near
the
door
,
and
hid
her
*NL*
face
in
her
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
lasted
for
two
minutes
:
Dolly
was
thinking
of
herself
.
That
*NL*
humiliation
of
which
she
was
always
conscious
came
back
to
her
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
bitterness
when
her
sister
reminded
her
of
it
.
She
had
not
*NL*
looked
for
such
cruelty
in
her
sister
,
and
she
was
angry
with
her
.
But
*NL*
suddenly
she
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
,
and
with
it
the
sound
of
*NL*
heart-rending
,
smothered
sobbing
,
and
felt
arms
about
her
neck
.
Kitty
*NL*
was
on
her
knees
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dolinka
,
I
am
so
,
so
wretched
!
''
she
whispered
penitently
.
And
the
sweet
*NL*
face
covered
with
tears
hid
itself
in
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
tears
were
the
indispensable
oil
,
without
which
the
machinery
*NL*
of
mutual
confidence
could
not
run
smoothly
between
the
two
sisters
,
the
*NL*
sisters
after
their
tears
talked
,
not
of
what
was
uppermost
in
their
*NL*
minds
,
but
,
though
they
talked
of
outside
matters
,
they
understood
each
*NL*
other
.
Kitty
knew
that
the
words
she
had
uttered
in
anger
about
her
*NL*
husband
's
infidelity
and
her
humiliating
position
had
cut
her
poor
*NL*
sister
to
the
heart
,
but
that
she
had
forgiven
her
.
Dolly
for
her
part
*NL*
knew
all
she
had
wanted
to
find
out
.
She
felt
certain
that
her
surmises
*NL*
were
correct
;
that
Kitty
's
misery
,
her
inconsolable
misery
,
was
due
*NL*
precisely
to
the
fact
that
Levin
had
made
her
an
offer
and
she
had
*NL*
refused
him
,
and
Vronsky
had
deceived
her
,
and
that
she
was
fully
*NL*
prepared
to
love
Levin
and
to
detest
Vronsky
.
Kitty
said
not
a
word
of
*NL*
that
;
she
talked
of
nothing
but
her
spiritual
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
to
make
me
miserable
,
''
she
said
,
getting
calmer
;
``
but
*NL*
can
you
understand
that
everything
has
become
hateful
,
loathsome
,
coarse
*NL*
to
me
,
and
I
myself
most
of
all
?
You
ca
n't
imagine
what
loathsome
*NL*
thoughts
I
have
about
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
whatever
loathsome
thoughts
can
you
have
?
''
asked
Dolly
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
utterly
loathsome
and
coarse
:
I
ca
n't
tell
you
.
It
's
not
*NL*
unhappiness
,
or
low
spirits
,
but
much
worse
.
As
though
everything
that
*NL*
was
good
in
me
was
all
hidden
away
,
and
nothing
was
left
but
the
most
*NL*
loathsome
.
Come
,
how
am
I
to
tell
you
?
''
she
went
on
,
seeing
the
puzzled
*NL*
look
in
her
sister
's
eyes
.
``
Father
began
saying
something
to
me
just
*NL*
now
...
It
seems
to
me
he
thinks
all
I
want
is
to
be
married
.
Mother
*NL*
takes
me
to
a
ball
:
it
seems
to
me
she
only
takes
me
to
get
me
married
*NL*
off
as
soon
as
may
be
,
and
be
rid
of
me
.
I
know
it
's
not
the
truth
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
drive
away
such
thoughts
.
Eligible
suitors
,
as
they
call
them
--
I
*NL*
ca
n't
bear
to
see
them
.
It
seems
to
me
they
're
taking
stock
of
me
and
*NL*
summing
me
up
.
In
old
days
to
go
anywhere
in
a
ball
dress
was
a
simple
*NL*
joy
to
me
,
I
admired
myself
;
now
I
feel
ashamed
and
awkward

And
then
!
*NL*
The
doctor

Then
...
''
Kitty
hesitated
;
she
wanted
to
say
further
that
*NL*
ever
since
this
change
had
taken
place
in
her
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
*NL*
become
insufferably
repulsive
to
her
,
and
that
she
could
not
see
him
*NL*
without
the
grossest
and
most
hideous
conceptions
rising
before
her
*NL*
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
everything
presents
itself
to
me
,
in
the
coarsest
,
most
*NL*
loathsome
light
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
That
's
my
illness
.
Perhaps
it
will
pass
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
n't
think
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
'm
never
happy
except
with
the
children
at
your
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
you
ca
n't
be
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
'm
coming

I
've
had
scarlatina
,
and
I
'll
persuade
mamma
to
*NL*
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
insisted
on
having
her
way
,
and
went
to
stay
at
her
sister
's
and
*NL*
nursed
the
children
all
through
the
scarlatina
,
for
scarlatina
it
turned
*NL*
out
to
be
.
The
two
sisters
brought
all
the
six
children
successfully
*NL*
through
it
,
but
Kitty
was
no
better
in
health
,
and
in
Lent
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
went
abroad

*NL*
Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
highest
Petersburg
society
is
essentially
one
:
in
it
everyone
knows
*NL*
everyone
else
,
everyone
even
visits
everyone
else
.
But
this
great
set
*NL*
has
its
subdivisions
.
Anna
Arkadyevna
Karenina
had
friends
and
close
*NL*
ties
in
three
different
circles
of
this
highest
society
.
One
circle
was
*NL*
her
husband
's
government
official
set
,
consisting
of
his
colleagues
and
*NL*
subordinates
,
brought
together
in
the
most
various
and
capricious
*NL*
manner
,
and
belonging
to
different
social
strata
.
Anna
found
it
*NL*
difficult
now
to
recall
the
feeling
of
almost
awe-stricken
reverence
*NL*
which
she
had
at
first
entertained
for
these
persons
.
Now
she
knew
all
*NL*
of
them
as
people
know
one
another
in
a
country
town
;
she
knew
their
*NL*
habits
and
weaknesses
,
and
where
the
shoe
pinched
each
one
of
them
.
She
*NL*
knew
their
relations
with
one
another
and
with
the
head
authorities
,
*NL*
knew
who
was
for
whom
,
and
how
each
one
maintained
his
position
,
and
*NL*
where
they
agreed
and
disagreed
.
But
the
circle
of
political
,
masculine
*NL*
interests
had
never
interested
her
,
in
spite
of
countess
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
influence
,
and
she
avoided
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
little
set
with
which
Anna
was
in
close
relations
was
the
one
by
*NL*
means
of
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
made
his
career
.
The
center
of
*NL*
this
circle
was
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
It
was
a
set
made
up
of
*NL*
elderly
,
ugly
,
benevolent
,
and
godly
women
,
and
clever
,
learned
,
and
*NL*
ambitious
men
.
One
of
the
clever
people
belonging
to
the
set
had
called
*NL*
it
``
the
conscience
of
Petersburg
society
.
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
the
*NL*
highest
esteem
for
this
circle
,
and
Anna
with
her
special
gift
for
*NL*
getting
on
with
everyone
,
had
in
the
early
days
of
her
life
in
*NL*
Petersburg
made
friends
in
this
circle
also
.
Now
,
since
her
return
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
she
had
come
to
feel
this
set
insufferable
.
It
seemed
to
her
*NL*
that
both
she
and
all
of
them
were
insincere
,
and
she
felt
so
bored
and
*NL*
ill
at
ease
in
that
world
that
she
went
to
see
the
Countess
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
as
little
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
circle
with
which
Anna
had
ties
was
preeminently
the
*NL*
fashionable
world
--
the
world
of
balls
,
of
dinners
,
of
sumptuous
dresses
,
*NL*
the
world
that
hung
on
to
the
court
with
one
hand
,
so
as
to
avoid
*NL*
sinking
to
the
level
of
the
demi-monde
.
For
the
demi-monde
the
members
*NL*
of
that
fashionable
world
believed
that
they
despised
,
though
their
*NL*
tastes
were
not
merely
similar
,
but
in
fact
identical
.
Her
connection
*NL*
with
this
circle
was
kept
up
through
Princess
Betsy
Tverskaya
,
her
*NL*
cousin
's
wife
,
who
had
an
income
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
*NL*
roubles
,
and
who
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
Anna
ever
since
she
first
*NL*
came
out
,
showed
her
much
attention
,
and
drew
her
into
her
set
,
making
*NL*
fun
of
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
coterie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
'm
old
and
ugly
I
'll
be
the
same
,
''
Betsy
used
to
say
;
``
but
for
a
*NL*
pretty
young
woman
like
you
it
's
early
days
for
that
house
of
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
at
first
avoided
as
far
as
she
could
Princess
Tverskaya
's
*NL*
world
,
because
it
necessitated
an
expenditure
beyond
her
means
,
and
*NL*
besides
in
her
heart
she
preferred
the
first
circle
.
But
since
her
visit
*NL*
to
Moscow
she
had
done
quite
the
contrary
.
She
avoided
her
*NL*
serious-minded
friends
,
and
went
out
into
the
fashionable
world
.
There
*NL*
she
met
Vronsky
,
and
experienced
an
agitating
joy
at
those
meetings
.
She
*NL*
met
Vronsky
specially
often
at
Betsy
's
for
Betsy
was
a
Vronsky
by
birth
*NL*
and
his
cousin
.
Vronsky
was
everywhere
where
he
had
any
chance
of
*NL*
meeting
Anna
,
and
speaking
to
her
,
when
he
could
,
of
his
love
.
She
gave
*NL*
him
no
encouragement
,
but
every
time
she
met
him
there
surged
up
in
her
*NL*
heart
that
same
feeling
of
quickened
life
that
had
come
upon
her
that
*NL*
day
in
the
railway
carriage
when
she
saw
him
for
the
first
time
.
She
was
*NL*
conscious
herself
that
her
delight
sparkled
in
her
eyes
and
curved
her
*NL*
lips
into
a
smile
,
and
she
could
not
quench
the
expression
of
this
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Anna
sincerely
believed
that
she
was
displeased
with
him
for
*NL*
daring
to
pursue
her
.
Soon
after
her
return
from
Moscow
,
on
arriving
at
*NL*
a
_
soiree
_
where
she
had
expected
to
meet
him
,
and
not
finding
him
*NL*
there
,
she
realized
distinctly
from
the
rush
of
disappointment
that
she
*NL*
had
been
deceiving
herself
,
and
that
this
pursuit
was
not
merely
not
*NL*
distasteful
to
her
,
but
that
it
made
the
whole
interest
of
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
celebrated
singer
was
singing
for
the
second
time
,
and
all
the
*NL*
fashionable
world
was
in
the
theater
.
Vronsky
,
seeing
his
cousin
from
*NL*
his
stall
in
the
front
row
,
did
not
wait
till
the
entr
`
acte
,
but
went
to
*NL*
her
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
come
to
dinner
?
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
I
marvel
at
the
*NL*
second
sight
of
lovers
,
''
she
added
with
a
smile
,
so
that
no
one
but
he
*NL*
could
hear
;
''
_
she
was
n't
there
_
.
But
come
after
the
opera
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
looked
inquiringly
at
her
.
She
nodded
.
He
thanked
her
by
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
I
remember
your
jeers
!
''
continued
Princess
Betsy
,
who
took
a
*NL*
peculiar
pleasure
in
following
up
this
passion
to
a
successful
issue
.
*NL*
``
What
's
become
of
all
that
?
You
're
caught
,
my
dear
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
one
desire
,
to
be
caught
,
''
answered
Vronsky
,
with
his
serene
,
*NL*
good-humored
smile
.
``
If
I
complain
of
anything
it
's
only
that
I
'm
not
*NL*
caught
enough
,
to
tell
the
truth
.
I
begin
to
lose
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
whatever
hope
can
you
have
?
''
said
Betsy
,
offended
on
behalf
of
her
*NL*
friend
.
''
_
Entendons
nous
...
_
''
But
in
her
eyes
there
were
gleams
of
*NL*
light
that
betrayed
that
she
understood
perfectly
and
precisely
as
he
*NL*
did
what
hope
he
might
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
whatever
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
laughing
and
showing
his
even
rows
of
*NL*
teeth
.
``
Excuse
me
,
''
he
added
,
taking
an
opera
glass
out
of
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
proceeding
to
scrutinize
,
over
her
bare
shoulder
,
the
row
of
boxes
*NL*
facing
them
.
``
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
becoming
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
well
aware
that
he
ran
no
risk
of
being
ridiculous
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
Betsy
or
any
other
fashionable
people
.
He
was
very
well
aware
*NL*
that
in
their
eyes
the
position
of
an
unsuccessful
lover
of
a
girl
,
or
*NL*
of
any
woman
free
to
marry
,
might
be
ridiculous
.
But
the
position
of
a
*NL*
man
pursuing
a
married
woman
,
and
,
regardless
of
everything
,
staking
his
*NL*
life
on
drawing
her
into
adultery
,
has
something
fine
and
grand
about
*NL*
it
,
and
can
never
be
ridiculous
;
and
so
it
was
with
a
proud
and
gay
*NL*
smile
under
his
mustaches
that
he
lowered
the
opera
glass
and
looked
at
*NL*
his
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
was
it
you
did
n't
come
to
dinner
?
''
she
said
,
admiring
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
tell
you
about
that
.
I
was
busily
employed
,
and
doing
what

do
*NL*
you
suppose
?
I
'll
give
you
a
hundred
guesses
,
a
thousand

you
'd
never

I
've
been
reconciling
a
husband
with
a
man
who
'd
insulted
his
*NL*
wife

Yes

really

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
succeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Almost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
must
tell
me
about
it

she
said
,
getting
up
.
``
Come

me
in

the
next

*NL*
*NL*
``
From

''
Betsy
queried
in
horror
,
though
she
could
not
herself
*NL*
have
distinguished
Nilsson
's
voice
from
any
chorus
girl
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't

I
've
an

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Blessed

''
said
*NL*
Betsy
,
vaguely
recollecting
she
had
heard
some
similar
saying
from
*NL*
someone
.
``
Very
well
,
then
,
sit
down
,
and
tell
me
what
it

all
about

And
she
sat
down
again

*NL*
``
This
is
rather
indiscreet
,
but
it
's
so
good
it
's
an
awful
temptation
to
*NL*
tell
the
story

''
said
Vronsky
,
looking
at
her
with
his
laughing
eyes
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
to
mention
any
names

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
shall
guess

so
much
the
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
listen
:
two
festive
young
men
were
driving

*NL*
*NL*
``
Officers
of
your
regiment
,
of
course
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did

they
were
officers

two
young
men
who
had
been
lunching

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
other
words

drinking

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly

They
were
driving
on
their
way
to
dinner
with
a
friend
in
the
*NL*
most
festive
state
of
mind
.
And
they
beheld
a
pretty
woman
in
a
hired
*NL*
sledge
;
she
overtakes
them
,
looks
round
at
them
,
and
,
so
they
fancy
*NL*
anyway
,
nods
to
them
and
laughs
.
They
,
of
course
,
follow
her
.
They
*NL*
gallop
at
full
speed
.
To
their
amazement
,
the
fair
one
alights
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
very
house
to
which
they
were
going
.
The
fair
one
darts
*NL*
upstairs
to
the
top
story
.
They
get
a
glimpse
of
red
lips
under
a
short
*NL*
veil
,
and
exquisite
little
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
describe
it
with
such
feeling
that
I
fancy
you
must
be
one
of
the
*NL*
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
after
what
you
said
,
just
now
!
Well
,
the
young
men
go
in
to
their
*NL*
comrade

;
he
was
giving
a
farewell
dinner
.
There
they
certainly
did
*NL*
drink
a
little
too
much
,
as
one
always
does
at
farewell
dinners
.
And
at
*NL*
dinner
they
inquire
who
lives
at
the
top
in
that
house

No
one
knows

*NL*
only
their
host

valet
,
in
answer
to
their
inquiry
whether
any
`
young
*NL*
ladies

are
living
on
the
top
floor
,
answered
that
there
were
a
great
*NL*
many
of
them
about
there

After
dinner
the
two
young
men
go
into
their
*NL*
host
's
study
,
and
write
a
letter
to
the
unknown
fair
one
.
They
compose
*NL*
an
ardent
epistle
,
a
declaration
in
fact
,
and
they
carry
the
letter
*NL*
upstairs
themselves
,
so
as
to
elucidate
whatever
might
appear
not
*NL*
perfectly
intelligible
in
the
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

you

horrible

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ring

A
maid-servant
opens
the
door
,
they
hand
her
the
letter

*NL*
assure
the
maid
that
they
're
both
so
in
love
that
they
'll
die
on
the
*NL*
spot
at
the
door

The
maid
,
stupefied
,
carries
in
their
messages

All
at
*NL*
once
a
gentleman
appears
with
whiskers
like
sausages
,
as
red
as
a
*NL*
lobster
,
announces
that
there
is
no
one
living
in
the

except
his

sends
them
both
about
their
business

How

Well

and
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
story

It
appears
that
it
's
a
*NL*
happy
couple
,
a
government
clerk
and
his
lady
.
The
government
clerk
*NL*
lodges
a
complaint
,
and
I
became
a
mediator
,
and
such
a
mediator
!

I
*NL*
assure
you
Talleyrand

We
apologize

we

entreat
forgiveness
for
the
unfortunate
misunderstanding

The
government
*NL*
clerk
with
the
sausages
begins
to
melt
,
but
he
,
too
,
desires
to
express
*NL*
his
sentiments

as
soon
as
ever
he
begins
to
express
them

he
begins
*NL*
to
get
hot
and
say
nasty
things
,
and
again
I
'm
obliged
to
trot
out
all
*NL*
my
diplomatic
talents
.
I
allowed
that
their
conduct
was
bad
,
but
I
urged
*NL*
him
to
take
into
consideration
their
heedlessness
,
their
youth
;
then
,
*NL*
too
,
the
young
men
had
only
just
been
lunching
together

`
You
*NL*
understand
.
They
regret
it
deeply

and
beg
you

overlook
their
*NL*
misbehavior

The
government
clerk
was
softened
once
more
.
'
I
consent

*NL*
count
,
and
am
ready
to
overlook
it
;
but
you
perceive
that
my
wife
--
my
*NL*
wife
's
a
respectable
woman
--
has
been
exposed
to
the
persecution
,
and
*NL*
insults

and
effrontery
of
young
upstarts

scoundrels

And
you
must
*NL*
understand
,
the
young
upstarts
are
present
all
the
while
,
and
I
have
to
*NL*
keep
the
peace
between
them
.
Again
I
call
out
all
my
diplomacy
,
and
*NL*
again
as
soon
as
the
thing
was
about
at
an
end
,
our
friend
the
*NL*
government
clerk
gets
hot
and
red
,
and
his
sausages
stand
on
end
with
*NL*
wrath
,

once
more
I
launch
out
into
diplomatic
wiles

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

must
tell

said
Betsy
,
laughing
,
to
a
lady
who
*NL*
came
into
her
box
.
``
He
has
been
making
me
laugh
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

_
bonne
chance

''
she
added
,
giving
Vronsky
one
finger
of
the
hand
*NL*
in
which
she
held
her
fan
,
and
with
a
shrug
of
her
shoulders
she
*NL*
twitched
down
the
bodice
of
her
gown
that
had
worked
up
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
duly
naked
as
she
moved
forward
towards
the
footlights
into
the
light
of
*NL*
the
gas
,
and
the
sight
of
all
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
drove
to
the
French
theater
,
where
he
really
had
to
see
the
*NL*
colonel
of
his
regiment
,
who
never
missed
a
single
performance
there
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
see
him
,
to
report
on
the
result
of
his
mediation
,
which
had
*NL*
occupied
and
amused
him
for
the
last
three
days
.
Petritsky
,
whom
he
*NL*
liked
,
was
implicated
in
the
affair
,
and
the
other
culprit
was
a
capital
*NL*
fellow
and
first-rate
comrade
,
who
had
lately
joined
the
regiment
,
the
*NL*
young
Prince
Kedrov
.
And
what
was
most
important
,
the
interests
of
the
*NL*
regiment
were
involved
in
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
young
men
were
in
Vronsky
's
company
.
The
colonel
of
the
*NL*
regiment
was
waited
upon
by
the
government
clerk
,
Venden
,
with
a
*NL*
complaint
against
his
officers
,
who
had
insulted
his
wife
.
His
young
*NL*
wife
,
so
Venden
told
the
story
--
he
had
been
married
half
a
year
--
was
at
*NL*
church
with
her
mother
,
and
suddenly
overcome
by
indisposition
,
arising
*NL*
from
her
interesting
condition
,
she
could
not
remain
standing
,
she
drove
*NL*
home
in
the
first
sledge
,
a
smart-looking
one
,
she
came
across
.
On
the
*NL*
spot
the
officers
set
off
in
pursuit
of
her
;
she
was
alarmed
,
and
*NL*
feeling
still
more
unwell
,
ran
up
the
staircase
home
.
Venden
himself
,
on
*NL*
returning
from
his
office
,
heard
a
ring
at
their
bell
and
voices
,
went
*NL*
out
,
and
seeing
the
intoxicated
officers
with
a
letter
,
he
had
turned
*NL*
them
out
.
He
asked
for
exemplary
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
very
well
,
''
said
the
colonel
to
Vronsky
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
invited
to
come
and
see
him
.
``
Petritsky
's
becoming
impossible

Not
a
*NL*
week
goes
by
without
some
scandal

This
government
clerk

n't
let
it
*NL*
drop
,
he
'll
go
on
with
the
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
saw
all
the
thanklessness
of
the
business
,
and
that
there
could
*NL*
be
no
question
of
a
duel
in
it
,
that
everything
must
be
done
to
soften
*NL*
the
government
clerk
,
and
hush
the
matter
up
.
The
colonel
had
called
in
*NL*
Vronsky
just
because
he
knew
him
to
be
an
honorable
and
intelligent
man
,
*NL*
and
,
more
than
all
,
a
man
who
cared
for
the
honor
of
the
regiment
.
They
*NL*
talked
it
over
,
and
decided
that
Petritsky
and
Kedrov
must
go
with
*NL*
Vronsky
to
Venden
's
to
apologize
.
The
colonel
and
Vronsky
were
both
*NL*
fully
aware
that
Vronsky
's
name
and
rank
would
be
sure
to
contribute
*NL*
greatly
to
the
softening
of
the
injured
husband
's
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
these
two
influences
were
not
in
fact
without
effect
;
though
the
*NL*
result
remained
,
as
Vronsky
had
described
,
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
French
theater
,
Vronsky
retired
to
the
foyer
with
the
*NL*
colonel
,
and
reported
to
him
his
success
,
or
non-success
.
The
colonel
,
*NL*
thinking
it
all
over
,
made
up
his
mind
not
to
pursue
the
matter
further
,
*NL*
but
then
for
his
own
satisfaction
proceeded
to
cross-examine
Vronsky
*NL*
about
his
interview
;
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
could
restrain
*NL*
his
laughter
,
as
Vronsky
described
how
the
government
clerk
,
after
*NL*
subsiding
for
a
while
,
would
suddenly
flare
up
again
,
as
he
recalled
the
*NL*
details
,
and
how
Vronsky
,
at
the
last
half
word
of
conciliation
,
*NL*
skillfully
maneuvered
a
retreat
,
shoving
Petritsky
out
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
disgraceful
story
,
but
killing
.
Kedrov
really
ca
n't
fight
the
*NL*
gentleman
!
Was
he
so
awfully
hot
?
''
he
commented
,
laughing
.
``
But
what
do
*NL*
you
say
to
Claire
today
?
She
's
marvelous
,
''
he
went
on
,
speaking
of
a
new
*NL*
French
actress
.
``
However
often
you
see
her
,
every
day
she
's
different
.
*NL*
It
's
only
the
French
who
can
do
that
.

Chapter
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Betsy
drove
home
from
the
theater
,
without
waiting
for
the
end
*NL*
of
the
last
act
.
She
had
only
just
time
to
go
into
her
dressing
room
,
*NL*
sprinkle
her
long
,
pale
face
with
powder
,
rub
it
,
set
her
dress
to
*NL*
rights
,
and
order
tea
in
the
big
drawing
room
,
when
one
after
another
*NL*
carriages
drove
up
to
her
huge
house
in
Bolshaia
Morskaia
.
Her
guests
*NL*
stepped
out
at
the
wide
entrance
,
and
the
stout
porter
,
who
used
to
read
*NL*
the
newspapers
in
the
mornings
behind
the
glass
door
,
to
the
edification
*NL*
of
the
passers-by
,
noiselessly
opened
the
immense
door
,
letting
the
*NL*
visitors
pass
by
him
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
instant
the
hostess
,
with
freshly
arranged
coiffure
*NL*
and
freshened
face
,
walked
in
at
one
door
and
her
guests
at
the
other
*NL*
door
of
the
drawing
room
,
a
large
room
with
dark
walls
,
downy
rugs
,
and
*NL*
a
brightly
lighted
table
,
gleaming
with
the
light
of
candles
,
white
*NL*
cloth
,
silver
samovar
,
and
transparent
china
tea
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hostess
sat
down
at
the
table
and
took
off
her
gloves
.
Chairs
were
*NL*
set
with
the
aid
of
footmen
,
moving
almost
imperceptibly
about
the
room
;
*NL*
the
party
settled
itself
,
divided
into
two
groups
:
one
round
the
samovar
*NL*
near
the
hostess
,
the
other
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
drawing
room
,
*NL*
round
the
handsome
wife
of
an
ambassador
,
in
black
velvet
,
with
sharply
*NL*
defined
black
eyebrows
.
In
both
groups
conversation
wavered
,
as
it
*NL*
always
does
,
for
the
first
few
minutes
,
broken
up
by
meetings
,
*NL*
greetings
,
offers
of
tea
,
and
as
it
were
,
feeling
about
for
something
to
*NL*
rest
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
exceptionally
good
as
an
actress
;
one
can
see
she
's
studied
*NL*
Kaulbach
,
''
said
a
diplomatic
attache
in
the
group
round
the
ambassador
's
*NL*
wife
.
``
Did
you
notice
how
she
fell
down
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
do
n't
let
us
talk
about
Nilsson
!
No
one
can
possibly
say
*NL*
anything
new
about
her
,
''
said
a
fat
,
red-faced
,
flaxen-headed
lady
,
*NL*
without
eyebrows
and
chignon
,
wearing
an
old
silk
dress
.
This
was
*NL*
Princess
Myakaya
,
noted
for
her
simplicity
and
the
roughness
of
her
*NL*
manners
,
and
nicknamed
_
enfant
terrible
_
.
Princess
Myakaya
,
sitting
in
*NL*
the
middle
between
the
two
groups
,
and
listening
to
both
,
took
part
in
*NL*
the
conversation
first
of
one
and
then
of
the
other
.
``
Three
people
have
*NL*
used
that
very
phrase
about
Kaulbach
to
me
today
already
,
just
as
though
*NL*
they
had
made
a
compact
about
it
.
And
I
ca
n't
see
why
they
liked
that
*NL*
remark
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
cut
short
by
this
observation
,
and
a
new
subject
*NL*
had
to
be
thought
of
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
tell
me
something
amusing
but
not
spiteful
,
''
said
the
ambassador
's
*NL*
wife
,
a
great
proficient
in
the
art
of
that
elegant
conversation
called
*NL*
by
the
English
,
_
small
talk
_
.
She
addressed
the
attache
,
who
was
at
a
*NL*
loss
now
what
to
begin
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
that
that
's
a
difficult
task
,
that
nothing
's
amusing
that
*NL*
is
n't
spiteful
,
''
he
began
with
a
smile
.
``
But
I
'll
try
.
Get
me
a
subject
.
*NL*
It
all
lies
in
the
subject
.
If
a
subject
's
given
me
,
it
's
easy
to
spin
*NL*
something
round
it
.
I
often
think
that
the
celebrated
talkers
of
the
*NL*
last
century
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
talk
cleverly
now
.
*NL*
Everything
clever
is
so
stale
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
been
said
long
ago
,
''
the
ambassador
's
wife
interrupted
him
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
began
amiably
,
but
just
because
it
was
too
amiable
,
it
*NL*
came
to
a
stop
again
.
They
had
to
have
recourse
to
the
sure
,
*NL*
never-failing
topic
--
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
there
's
something
Louis
Quinze
about
Tushkevitch
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
glancing
towards
a
handsome
,
fair-haired
young
man
,
standing
at
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
He
's
in
the
same
style
as
the
drawing
room
and
that
's
why
it
*NL*
is
he
's
so
often
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
was
maintained
,
since
it
rested
on
allusions
to
what
*NL*
could
not
be
talked
of
in
that
room
--
that
is
to
say
,
of
the
relations
of
*NL*
Tushkevitch
with
their
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Round
the
samovar
and
the
hostess
the
conversation
had
been
meanwhile
*NL*
vacillating
in
just
the
same
way
between
three
inevitable
topics
:
the
*NL*
latest
piece
of
public
news
,
the
theater
,
and
scandal
.
It
,
too
,
came
*NL*
finally
to
rest
on
the
last
topic
,
that
is
,
ill-natured
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
the
Maltishtcheva
woman
--
the
mother
,
not
the
*NL*
daughter
--
has
ordered
a
costume
in
_
diable
rose
_
color
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
No
,
that
's
too
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
that
with
her
sense
--
for
she
's
not
a
fool
,
you
know
--
that
she
*NL*
does
n't
see
how
funny
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
had
something
to
say
in
censure
or
ridicule
of
the
luckless
*NL*
Madame
Maltishtcheva
,
and
the
conversation
crackled
merrily
,
like
a
*NL*
burning
faggot-stack
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
of
Princess
Betsy
,
a
good-natured
fat
man
,
an
ardent
*NL*
collector
of
engravings
,
hearing
that
his
wife
had
visitors
,
came
into
*NL*
the
drawing
room
before
going
to
his
club
.
Stepping
noiselessly
over
the
*NL*
thick
rugs
,
he
went
up
to
Princess
Myakaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
like
Nilsson
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
can
you
steal
upon
anyone
like
that
!
How
you
startled
me
!
''
she
*NL*
responded
.
``
Please
do
n't
talk
to
me
about
the
opera
;
you
know
nothing
*NL*
about
music
.
I
'd
better
meet
you
on
your
own
ground
,
and
talk
about
your
*NL*
majolica
and
engravings
.
Come
now
,
what
treasure
have
you
been
buying
*NL*
lately
at
the
old
curiosity
shops
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
me
to
show
you
?
But
you
do
n't
understand
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
show
me
!
I
've
been
learning
about
them
at
those
--
what
's
their
*NL*
names
?
...
the
bankers
...
they
've
some
splendid
engravings
.
They
showed
*NL*
them
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
have
you
been
at
the
Schuetzburgs
?
''
asked
the
hostess
from
the
*NL*
samovar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
_
ma
chere
_
.
They
asked
my
husband
and
me
to
dinner
,
and
told
us
*NL*
the
sauce
at
that
dinner
cost
a
hundred
pounds
,
''
Princess
Myakaya
said
,
*NL*
speaking
loudly
,
and
conscious
everyone
was
listening
;
``
and
very
nasty
*NL*
sauce
it
was
,
some
green
mess
.
We
had
to
ask
them
,
and
I
made
them
sauce
*NL*
for
eighteen
pence
,
and
everybody
was
very
much
pleased
with
it
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
run
to
hundred-pound
sauces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
unique
!
''
said
the
lady
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marvelous
!
''
said
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sensation
produced
by
Princess
Myakaya
's
speeches
was
always
unique
,
*NL*
and
the
secret
of
the
sensation
she
produced
lay
in
the
fact
that
though
*NL*
she
spoke
not
always
appropriately
,
as
now
,
she
said
simple
things
with
*NL*
some
sense
in
them
.
In
the
society
in
which
she
lived
such
plain
*NL*
statements
produced
the
effect
of
the
wittiest
epigram
.
Princess
Myakaya
*NL*
could
never
see
why
it
had
that
effect
,
but
she
knew
it
had
,
and
took
*NL*
advantage
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
everyone
had
been
listening
while
Princess
Myakaya
spoke
,
and
so
the
*NL*
conversation
around
the
ambassador
's
wife
had
dropped
,
Princess
Betsy
*NL*
tried
to
bring
the
whole
party
together
,
and
turned
to
the
ambassador
's
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
really
not
have
tea
?
You
should
come
over
here
by
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
're
very
happy
here
,
''
the
ambassador
's
wife
responded
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
she
went
on
with
the
conversation
that
had
been
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
agreeable
conversation
.
They
were
criticizing
the
*NL*
Karenins
,
husband
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
is
quite
changed
since
her
stay
in
Moscow
.
There
's
something
*NL*
strange
about
her
,
''
said
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
change
is
that
she
brought
back
with
her
the
shadow
of
Alexey
*NL*
Vronsky
,
''
said
the
ambassador
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
of
it
?
There
's
a
fable
of
Grimm
's
about
a
man
without
a
*NL*
shadow
,
a
man
who
's
lost
his
shadow
.
And
that
's
his
punishment
for
*NL*
something
.
I
never
could
understand
how
it
was
a
punishment
.
But
a
woman
*NL*
must
dislike
being
without
a
shadow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
women
with
a
shadow
usually
come
to
a
bad
end

said
Anna
's
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
luck
to
your
tongue

said
Princess
Myakaya
suddenly
.
``
Madame
*NL*
Karenina
's
a
splendid
woman

I
do
n't
like

husband

I
like

*NL*
very
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
like
her
husband

He
's
such
a
remarkable
man

the
*NL*
ambassador

``
My

*NL*
``
And
my
husband
tells
me
just
the

I
do

it

said
*NL*
Princess
Myakaya
.
``
If
our
husbands
did
n't
talk
to
us

we
should
see
the
*NL*
facts
as
they
are

Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
to
my
thinking

is
simply
a
*NL*
fool
.
I
say
it
in
a
whisper
...
but
does
n't
it
really
make
everything
*NL*
clear
?
Before
,
when
I
was
told
to
consider
him
clever
,
I
kept
looking
*NL*
for
his
ability
,
and
thought
myself
a
fool
for
not
seeing
it
;
but
*NL*
directly
I
said
,
_
he
's
a
fool

_
though
only
in
a
whisper

everything
's
*NL*
explained
,
is
n't
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
spiteful
you
are
today

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit

I
'd
no
other
way
out

two

*NL*
''
`
No
one
is
satisfied
with
his
fortune

everyone
is
satisfied
with

his
wit

The
attache
repeated
the
French
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
it
,
just
it
,
''
Princess
Myakaya
turned
to
him
.
``

the
*NL*
point
is
that

Oh

self-defense

*NL*
any
right
to
blame
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
having
duly
disposed
of
Anna
's
friend
,
the
Princess
Myakaya
got
up
,
*NL*
and
together
with
the
ambassador
's
wife
,
joined
the
group
at
the
table
,
*NL*
where
the
conversation
was
dealing
with
the
king
of
Prussia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wicked
gossip
were
you
talking
over
there
?
''
asked
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
Karenins
.
The
princess
gave
us
a
sketch
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
''
said
the
ambassador
's
wife
with
a
smile
,
as
she
sat
*NL*
down
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
we
did
n't
hear
it
!

said
Princess
Betsy
,
glancing
towards
the
*NL*
door
.
``
Ah
,
here
you
are
at
last
!
''
she
said
,
turning
with
a
smile
to
*NL*
Vronsky
,
as
he
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
not
merely
acquainted
with
all
the
persons
whom
he
was
*NL*
meeting
here
;
he
saw
them
all
every
day
;
and
so
he
came
in
with
the
*NL*
quiet
manner
with
which
one
enters
a
room
full
of
people
from
whom
one
*NL*
has
only
just
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
I
come
from
?
''
he
said
,
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
*NL*
ambassador
's
wife
.
``
Well
,
there
's
no
help
for
it
,
I
must
confess
.
From
*NL*
the
_
opera
bouffe
_
.
I
do
believe
I
've
seen
it
a
hundred
times
,
and
*NL*
always
with
fresh
enjoyment
.
It
's
exquisite
!
I
know
it
's
disgraceful
,
*NL*
but
I
go
to
sleep
at
the
opera
,
and
I
sit
out
the
_
opera
bouffe
_
to
the
*NL*
last
minute
,
and
enjoy
it
.
This
evening
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
mentioned
a
French
actress
,
and
was
going
to
tell
something
about
*NL*
her
;
but
the
ambassador
's
wife
,
with
playful
horror
,
cut
him
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
tell
us
about
that
horror
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
wo
n't
especially
as
everyone
knows
those
horrors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
should
all
go
to
see
them
if
it
were
accepted
as
the
correct
*NL*
thing

in

Chapter
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Steps
were
heard
at
the
door
,
and
Princess
Betsy
,
knowing
it
was
Madame
*NL*
Karenina
,
glanced
at
Vronsky
.
He
was
looking
towards
the
door
,
and
his
*NL*
face
wore
a
strange
new
expression
.
Joyfully
,
intently
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
timidly
,
he
gazed
at
the
approaching
figure
,
and
slowly
he
rose
to
*NL*
his
feet
.
Anna
walked
into
the
drawing
room
.
Holding
herself
extremely
*NL*
erect
,
as
always
,
looking
straight
before
her
,
and
moving
with
her
*NL*
swift
,
resolute
,
and
light
step
,
that
distinguished
her
from
all
other
*NL*
society
women
,
she
crossed
the
short
space
to
her
hostess
,
shook
hands
*NL*
with
her
,
smiled
,
and
with
the
same
smile
looked
around
at
Vronsky
.
*NL*
Vronsky
bowed
low
and
pushed
a
chair
up
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
acknowledged
this
only
by
a
slight
nod
,
flushed
a
little
,
and
*NL*
frowned
.
But
immediately
,
while
rapidly
greeting
her
acquaintances
,
and
*NL*
shaking
the
hands
proffered
to
her
,
she
addressed
Princess
Betsy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
at
Countess
Lidia
's
,
and
meant
to
have
come
here
earlier
,
*NL*
but
I
stayed
on
.
Sir
John
was
there
.
He
's
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
this
missionary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
told
us
about
the
life
in
India
,
most
interesting
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
,
interrupted
by
her
coming
in
,
flickered
up
again
like
*NL*
the
light
of
a
lamp
being
blown
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
John
!
Yes
,
Sir
John
;
I
've
seen
him
.
He
speaks
well
.
The
Vlassieva
*NL*
girl
's
quite
in
love
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
true
the
younger
Vlassieva
girl
's
to
marry
Topov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
say
it
's
quite
a
settled
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
at
the
parents
!
They
say
it
's
a
marriage
for
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
love
?
What
antediluvian
notions
you
have
!
Can
one
talk
of
love
in
*NL*
these
days
?
''
said
the
ambassador
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
be
done
?
It
's
a
foolish
old
fashion
that
's
kept
up
still
,
''
*NL*
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
for
those
who
keep
up
the
fashion
.
The
only
happy
*NL*
marriages
I
know
are
marriages
of
prudence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
then
how
often
the
happiness
of
these
prudent
marriages
flies
*NL*
away
like
dust
just
because
that
passion
turns
up
that
they
have
refused
*NL*
to
recognize
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
by
marriages
of
prudence
we
mean
those
in
which
both
parties
have
*NL*
sown
their
wild
oats
already
.
That
's
like
scarlatina
--
one
has
to
go
*NL*
through
it
and
get
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
ought
to
find
out
how
to
vaccinate
for
love
,
like
smallpox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
love
in
my
young
days
with
a
deacon

said
the
Princess
*NL*
Myakaya
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
did
me
any
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
imagine

joking
apart
,
that
to
know
love

one
must
make
mistakes
*NL*

then
correct
them

''
said
Princess
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
after
marriage

said
the
ambassador
's
wife
playfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
's
never
too
late
to
mend
.

''
The
attache
repeated
the
English
*NL*
proverb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
Betsy
agreed
;
``
one
must
make
mistakes
and
correct
them

What
*NL*
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
she
turned
to
Anna
,
who
,
with
a
faintly
*NL*
perceptible
resolute
smile
on
her
lips
,
was
listening
in
silence
to
the
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Anna
,
playing
with
the
glove
she
had
taken
off
,
``
I
think
*NL*
...
of
so
many
men
,
so
many
minds

certainly
so
many
hearts

so
many
*NL*
kinds
of
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
gazing
at
Anna
,
and
with
a
fainting
heart
waiting
for
what
*NL*
she
would
say
.
He
sighed
as
after
a
danger
escaped
when
she
uttered
*NL*
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
suddenly
turned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
had
a
letter
from
Moscow
.
They
write
me
that
Kitty
*NL*
Shtcherbatskaya
's
very
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
Vronsky
,
knitting
his
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
looked
sternly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
interest
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary

it
does

very
much
.
What
was
it
exactly
they
told
you
,
*NL*
if
I
may
know
?
''
he
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
got
up
and
went
to
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
cup
of
tea
,
''
she
said
,
standing
at
her
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Betsy
was
pouring
out
the
tea
,
Vronsky
went
up
to
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
they
write
to
you
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
think
men
have
no
understanding
of
what
's
not
honorable
though
*NL*
they
're
always
talking
of
it
,
''
said
Anna
,
without
answering
him
.
``
I
've
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
you
so
a
long
while
,
''
she
added
,
and
moving
a
few
steps
*NL*
away
,
she
sat
down
at
a
table
in
a
corner
covered
with
albums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
your
words

''
he
said
,
handing
*NL*
her
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
towards
the
sofa
beside
her
,
and
he
instantly
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
been
wanting
to
tell
you
,
''
she
said
,
not
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
``
You
behaved
wrongly
,
very
wrongly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
know
that
I
've
acted
wrongly
?
But
who
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
my
doing
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
that
to
me
for
?
''
she
said
,
glancing
severely
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
for
,
''
he
answered
boldly
and
joyfully
,
meeting
her
glance
*NL*
and
not
dropping
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
he
,
but
she
,
was
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
only
shows
you
have
no
heart
,
''
she
said
.
But
her
eyes
said
that
*NL*
she
knew
he
had
a
heart
,
and
that
was
why
she
was
afraid
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
spoke
of
just
now
was
a
mistake
,
and
not
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
that
I
have
forbidden
you
to
utter
that
word
,
that
hateful
*NL*
word
,
''
said
Anna
,
with
a
shudder
.
But
at
once
she
felt
that
by
that
very
*NL*
word
``
forbidden
''
she
had
shown
that
she
acknowledged
certain
rights
over
*NL*
him
,
and
by
that
very
fact
was
encouraging
him
to
speak
of
love
.
``
I
have
*NL*
long
meant
to
tell
you
this
,
''
she
went
on
,
looking
resolutely
into
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
hot
all
over
from
the
burning
flush
on
her
cheeks
.
``
I
've
come
*NL*
on
purpose
this
evening
,
knowing
I
should
meet
you
.
I
have
come
to
tell
*NL*
you
that
this
must
end
.
I
have
never
blushed
before
anyone
,
and
you
*NL*
force
me
to
feel
to
blame
for
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
and
was
struck
by
a
new
spiritual
beauty
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
of
me
?
''
he
said
simply
and
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
go
to
Moscow
and
ask
for
Kitty
's
forgiveness
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
wish
that
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
she
was
saying
what
she
forced
herself
to
say
,
not
what
she
*NL*
wanted
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
love
me
,
as
you
say
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
do
so
that
I
may
be
at
*NL*
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
grew
radiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
that
you
're
all
my
life
to
me
?
But
I
know
no
peace

*NL*
I
ca
n't
give
it
to
you
;
all
myself

and
love

yes

I
ca
n't
think
of
*NL*
you

myself
apart

You

I
are
one
to
me

And
I
see
no
chance

before
us
of
peace
for
me

for
you

I
see
a
chance
of
despair
,
of
*NL*
wretchedness
...
or
I
see
a
chance
of
bliss
,
what
bliss
!
...
Can
it
be
*NL*
there
's
no
chance
of
it
?
''
he
murmured
with
his
lips
;
but
she
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
strained
every
effort
of
her
mind
to
say
what
ought
to
be
said
.
But
*NL*
instead
of
that
she
let
her
eyes
rest
on
him
,
full
of
love
,
and
made
no
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
come
!
''
he
thought
in
ecstasy
.
``
When
I
was
beginning
to
despair
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
there
would
be
no
end

it

come
!
She
loves
me
!
She
owns
*NL*
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
this
for
me
:
never
say
such
things
to
me
,
and
let
us
be
*NL*
friends

she
said
in
words
;
but
her
eyes
spoke
quite
differently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
we
shall
never
be

you
know
that
yourself

Whether
we
shall
be
*NL*
the
happiest
or
the
wretchedest
of
people
--
that
's
in
your
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
said
something
,
but
he
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
one
thing
only
:
I
ask
for
the
right
to
hope
,
to
suffer
as
I
do

*NL*
But
if
even
that
can
not
be
,
command
me
to
disappear
,
and
I
disappear
.
*NL*
You
shall
not
see
me
if
my
presence
is
distasteful
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
drive
you
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
do
n't
change
anything

leave
everything
as
it
is

he
said
in
a
*NL*
shaky
voice
.
``
Here
's
your
husband

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
in
fact
walk
into
the
room
*NL*
with
his
calm
,
awkward
gait
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
at
his
wife
and
Vronsky
,
he
went
up
to
the
lady
of
the
house
,
*NL*
and
sitting
down
for
a
cup
of
tea
,
began
talking
in
his
deliberate
,
*NL*
always
audible
voice
,
in
his
habitual
tone
of
banter
,
ridiculing
*NL*
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Rambouillet
is
in
full
conclave
,
''
he
said
,
looking
round
at
all
*NL*
the
party
;
``
the
graces
and
the
muses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Princess
Betsy
could
not
endure
that
tone
of
his
--
``
sneering
,
''
as
she
*NL*
called
it
,
using
the
English
word
,
and
like
a
skillful
hostess
she
at
*NL*
once
brought
him
into
a
serious
conversation
on
the
subject
of
universal
*NL*
conscription
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
immediately
interested
in
the
*NL*
subject
,
and
began
seriously
defending
the
new
imperial
decree
against
*NL*
Princess
Betsy
,
who
had
attacked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
and
Anna
still
sat
at
the
little
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
getting
indecorous
,
''
whispered
one
lady
,
with
an
expressive
*NL*
glance
at
Madame
Karenina
,
Vronsky
,
and
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Anna
's
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
only
those
ladies
,
almost
everyone
in
the
room
,
even
the
*NL*
Princess
Myakaya
and
Betsy
herself
,
looked
several
times
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
two
who
had
withdrawn
from
the
general
circle
,
as
*NL*
though
that
were
a
disturbing
fact
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
the
only
*NL*
person
who
did
not
once
look
in
that
direction
,
and
was
not
diverted
*NL*
from
the
interesting
discussion
he
had
entered
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
the
disagreeable
impression
that
was
being
made
on
everyone
,
*NL*
Princess
Betsy
slipped
someone
else
into
her
place
to
listen
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
and
went
up
to
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
always
amazed
at
the
clearness
and
precision
of
your
husband
's
*NL*
language
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
most
transcendental
ideas
seem
to
be
within
my
*NL*
grasp
when
he
's
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
Anna
,
radiant
with
a
smile
of
happiness
,
and
not
*NL*
understanding
a
word
of
what
Betsy
had
said
.
She
crossed
over
to
the
big
*NL*
table
and
took
part
in
the
general
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
after
staying
half
an
hour
,
went
up
to
his
wife
*NL*
and
suggested
that
they
should
go
home
together
.
But
she
answered
,
not
*NL*
looking
at
him
,
that
she
was
staying
to
supper
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
made
his
bows
and
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fat
old
Tatar
,
Madame
Karenina
's
coachman
,
was
with
difficulty
*NL*
holding
one
of
her
pair
of
grays
,
chilled
with
the
cold
and
rearing
at
*NL*
the
entrance
.
A
footman
stood
opening
the
carriage
door
.
The
hall
porter
*NL*
stood
holding
open
the
great
door
of
the
house
.
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
with
*NL*
her
quick
little
hand
,
was
unfastening
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
,
caught
in
*NL*
the
hook
of
her
fur
cloak
,
and
with
bent
head
listening
to
the
words
*NL*
Vronsky
murmured
as
he
escorted
her
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
said
nothing
,
of
course
,
and
I
ask
nothing
,
''
he
was
saying
;
``
but
*NL*
you
know
that
friendship
's
not
what
I
want
:
that
there
's
only
one
*NL*
happiness
in
life
for
me
,
that
word
that
you
dislike
so
...
yes
,
*NL*
love
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
,
''
she
repeated
slowly
,
in
an
inner
voice
,
and
suddenly
,
at
the
*NL*
very
instant
she
unhooked
the
lace
,
she
added
,
``
Why
I
do
n't
like
the
*NL*
word
is
that
it
means
too
much
to
me
,
far
more
than
you
can
understand
,
''
*NL*
and
she
glanced
into
his
face
.
''
_
Au
revoir
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
her
hand
,
and
with
her
rapid
,
springy
step
she
passed
by
*NL*
the
porter
and
vanished
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
glance
,
the
touch
of
her
hand
,
set
him
aflame
.
He
kissed
the
palm
of
*NL*
his
hand
where
she
had
touched
it
,
and
went
home
,
happy
in
the
sense
*NL*
that
he
had
got
nearer
to
the
attainment
of
his
aims
that
evening
than
*NL*
during
the
last
two
months
.

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
seen
nothing
striking
or
improper
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
his
wife
was
sitting
with
Vronsky
at
a
table
apart
,
in
eager
*NL*
conversation
with
him
about
something
.
But
he
noticed
that
to
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
party
this
appeared
something
striking
and
improper
,
and
for
that
*NL*
reason
it
seemed
to
him
too
to
be
improper
.
He
made
up
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
must
speak
of
it
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
to
his
study
,
as
he
usually
*NL*
did
,
seated
himself
in
his
low
chair
,
opened
a
book
on
the
Papacy
at
the
*NL*
place
where
he
had
laid
the
paper-knife
in
it
,
and
read
till
one
*NL*
o'clock
,
just
as
he
usually
did
.
But
from
time
to
time
he
rubbed
his
*NL*
high
forehead
and
shook
his
head
,
as
though
to
drive
away
something
.
At
*NL*
his
usual
time
he
got
up
and
made
his
toilet
for
the
night
.
Anna
*NL*
Arkadyevna
had
not
yet
come
in
.
With
a
book
under
his
arm
he
went
*NL*
upstairs
.
But
this
evening
,
instead
of
his
usual
thoughts
and
*NL*
meditations
upon
official
details
,
his
thoughts
were
absorbed
by
his
*NL*
wife
and
something
disagreeable
connected
with
her
.
Contrary
to
his
*NL*
usual
habit
,
he
did
not
get
into
bed
,
but
fell
to
walking
up
and
down
*NL*
the
rooms
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
.
He
could
not
go
to
*NL*
bed
,
feeling
that
it
was
absolutely
needful
for
him
first
to
think
*NL*
thoroughly
over
the
position
that
had
just
arisen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
talk
to
his
*NL*
wife
about
it
,
it
had
seemed
a
very
easy
and
simple
matter
.
But
now
,
*NL*
when
he
began
to
think
over
the
question
that
had
just
presented
itself
,
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
very
complicated
and
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
not
jealous
.
Jealousy
according
to
his
notions
*NL*
was
an
insult
to
one
's
wife
,
and
one
ought
to
have
confidence
in
one
's
*NL*
wife
.
Why
one
ought
to
have
confidence
--
that
is
to
say
,
complete
*NL*
conviction
that
his
young
wife
would
always
love
him
--
he
did
not
ask
*NL*
himself
.
But
he
had
no
experience
of
lack
of
confidence
,
because
he
had
*NL*
confidence
in
her
,
and
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
have
it
.
Now
,
*NL*
though
his
conviction
that
jealousy
was
a
shameful
feeling
and
that
one
*NL*
ought
to
feel
confidence
,
had
not
broken
down
,
he
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
standing
face
to
face
with
something
illogical
and
irrational
,
and
did
*NL*
not
know
what
was
to
be
done
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
standing
face
to
*NL*
face
with
life
,
with
the
possibility
of
his
wife
's
loving
someone
other
*NL*
than
himself
,
and
this
seemed
to
him
very
irrational
and
*NL*
incomprehensible
because
it
was
life
itself
.
All
his
life
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
lived
and
worked
in
official
spheres
,
having
to
do
*NL*
with
the
reflection
of
life
.
And
every
time
he
had
stumbled
against
life
*NL*
itself
he
had
shrunk
away
from
it
.
Now
he
experienced
a
feeling
akin
to
*NL*
that
of
a
man
who
,
while
calmly
crossing
a
precipice
by
a
bridge
,
should
*NL*
suddenly
discover
that
the
bridge
is
broken
,
and
that
there
is
a
chasm
*NL*
below
.
That
chasm
was
life
itself
,
the
bridge
that
artificial
life
in
*NL*
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
lived
.
For
the
first
time
the
question
*NL*
presented
itself
to
him
of
the
possibility
of
his
wife
's
loving
someone
*NL*
else
,
and
he
was
horrified
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
undress
,
but
walked
up
and
down
with
his
regular
tread
over
*NL*
the
resounding
parquet
of
the
dining
room
,
where
one
lamp
was
burning
,
*NL*
over
the
carpet
of
the
dark
drawing
room
,
in
which
the
light
was
*NL*
reflected
on
the
big
new
portrait
of
himself
hanging
over
the
sofa
,
and
*NL*
across
her
boudoir
,
where
two
candles
burned
,
lighting
up
the
portraits
*NL*
of
her
parents
and
woman
friends
,
and
the
pretty
knick-knacks
of
her
*NL*
writing
table
,
that
he
knew
so
well
.
He
walked
across
her
boudoir
to
the
*NL*
bedroom
door
,
and
turned
back
again
.
At
each
turn
in
his
walk
,
*NL*
especially
at
the
parquet
of
the
lighted
dining
room
,
he
halted
and
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
Yes
,
this
I
must
decide
and
put
a
stop
to
;
I
must
express
*NL*
my
view
of
it
and
my
decision
.
''
And
he
turned
back
again
.
``
But
express
*NL*
what
--
what
decision
?
''
he
said
to
himself
in
the
drawing
room
,
and
he
*NL*
found
no
reply
.
``
But
after
all
,
''
he
asked
himself
before
turning
into
*NL*
the
boudoir
,
``
what
has
occurred
?
Nothing
.
She
was
talking
a
long
while
*NL*
with
him
.
But
what
of
that
?
Surely
women
in
society
can
talk
to
whom
*NL*
they
please
.
And
then
,
jealousy
means
lowering
both
myself
and
her
,
''
he
*NL*
told
himself
as
he
went
into
her
boudoir
;
but
this
dictum
,
which
had
*NL*
always
had
such
weight
with
him
before
,
had
now
no
weight
and
no
meaning
*NL*
at
all
.
And
from
the
bedroom
door
he
turned
back
again
;
but
as
he
*NL*
entered
the
dark
drawing
room
some
inner
voice
told
him
that
it
was
not
*NL*
so
,
and
that
if
others
noticed
it
that
showed
that
there
was
something
.
*NL*
And
he
said
to
himself
again
in
the
dining
room
,
``
Yes
,
I
must
decide
and
*NL*
put
a
stop
to
it
,
and
express
my
view
of
it
...
''
And
again
at
the
turn
in
*NL*
the
drawing
room
he
asked
himself
,
``
Decide
how
?
''
And
again
he
asked
*NL*
himself
,
``
What
had
occurred
?
''
and
answered
,
``
Nothing
,
''
and
recollected
*NL*
that
jealousy
was
a
feeling
insulting
to
his
wife
;
but
again
in
the
*NL*
drawing
room
he
was
convinced
that
something
had
happened
.
His
thoughts
,
*NL*
like
his
body
,
went
round
a
complete
circle
,
without
coming
upon
*NL*
anything
new
.
He
noticed
this
,
rubbed
his
forehead
,
and
sat
down
in
her
*NL*
boudoir
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
looking
at
her
table
,
with
the
malachite
blotting
case
lying
at
*NL*
the
top
and
an
unfinished
letter
,
his
thoughts
suddenly
changed
.
He
*NL*
began
to
think
of
her
,
of
what
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
he
pictured
vividly
to
himself
her
personal
life
,
her
ideas
,
*NL*
her
desires
,
and
the
idea
that
she
could
and
should
have
a
separate
life
*NL*
of
her
own
seemed
to
him
so
alarming
that
he
made
haste
to
dispel
it
.
It
*NL*
was
the
chasm
which
he
was
afraid
to
peep
into
.
To
put
himself
in
*NL*
thought
and
feeling
in
another
person
's
place
was
a
spiritual
exercise
*NL*
not
natural
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
He
looked
on
this
spiritual
*NL*
exercise
as
a
harmful
and
dangerous
abuse
of
the
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
worst
of
it
all
,
''
thought
he
,
``
is
that
just
now
,
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
my
great
work
is
approaching
completion
''
-LRB-
he
was
thinking
of
*NL*
the
project
he
was
bringing
forward
at
the
time
-RRB-
,
``
when
I
stand
in
need
*NL*
of
all
my
mental
peace
and
all
my
energies
,
just
now
this
stupid
worry
*NL*
should
fall
foul
of
me
.
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
I
'm
not
one
of
those
men
*NL*
who
submit
to
uneasiness
and
worry
without
having
the
force
of
character
*NL*
to
face
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
think
it
over
,
come
to
a
decision
,
and
put
it
out
of
my
mind
,
''
*NL*
he
said
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
of
her
feelings
,
of
what
has
passed
and
may
be
passing
in
*NL*
her
soul
,
that
's
not
my
affair
;
that
's
the
affair
of
her
conscience
,
and
*NL*
falls
under
the
head
of
religion
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
feeling
*NL*
consolation
in
the
sense
that
he
had
found
to
which
division
of
*NL*
regulating
principles
this
new
circumstance
could
be
properly
referred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
to
himself
,
``
questions
as
to
her
*NL*
feelings
,
and
so
on
,
are
questions
for
her
conscience
,
with
which
I
can
*NL*
have
nothing
to
do
.
My
duty
is
clearly
defined
.
As
the
head
of
the
*NL*
family
,
I
am
a
person
bound
in
duty
to
guide
her
,
and
consequently
,
in
*NL*
part
the
person
responsible
;
I
am
bound
to
point
out
the
danger
I
*NL*
perceive
,
to
warn
her
,
even
to
use
my
authority
.
I
ought
to
speak
*NL*
plainly
to
her
.
''
And
everything
that
he
would
say
tonight
to
his
wife
*NL*
took
clear
shape
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
head
.
Thinking
over
what
he
*NL*
would
say
,
he
somewhat
regretted
that
he
should
have
to
use
his
time
and
*NL*
mental
powers
for
domestic
consumption
,
with
so
little
to
show
for
it
,
*NL*
but
,
in
spite
of
that
,
the
form
and
contents
of
the
speech
before
him
*NL*
shaped
itself
as
clearly
and
distinctly
in
his
head
as
a
ministerial
*NL*
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
and
express
fully
the
following
points
:
first
,
exposition
of
*NL*
the
value
to
be
attached
to
public
opinion
and
to
decorum
;
secondly
,
*NL*
exposition
of
religious
significance
of
marriage
;
thirdly
,
if
need
be
,
*NL*
reference
to
the
calamity
possibly
ensuing
to
our
son
;
fourthly
,
*NL*
reference
to
the
unhappiness
likely
to
result
to
herself
.
''
And
,
*NL*
interlacing
his
fingers
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stretched
them
,
and
the
*NL*
joints
of
the
fingers
cracked
.
This
trick
,
a
bad
habit
,
the
cracking
of
*NL*
his
fingers
,
always
soothed
him
,
and
gave
precision
to
his
thoughts
,
so
*NL*
needful
to
him
at
this
juncture
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
sound
of
a
carriage
driving
up
to
the
front
door
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
's
step
was
heard
mounting
the
stairs
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
ready
for
his
speech
,
stood
compressing
his
crossed
fingers
,
waiting
to
*NL*
see
if
the
crack
would
not
come
again
.
One
joint
cracked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Already
,
from
the
sound
of
light
steps
on
the
stairs
,
he
was
aware
that
*NL*
she
was
close
,
and
though
he
was
satisfied
with
his
speech
,
he
felt
*NL*
frightened
of
the
explanation
confronting

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
came
in
with
hanging
head
,
playing
with
the
tassels
of
her
hood
.
*NL*
Her
face
was
brilliant
and
glowing
;
but
this
glow
was
not
one
of
*NL*
brightness
;
it
suggested
the
fearful
glow
of
a
conflagration
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
dark
night
.
On
seeing
her
husband
,
Anna
raised
her
head
and
*NL*
smiled
,
as
though
she
had
just
waked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
in
bed
?
What
a
wonder
!
''
she
said
,
letting
fall
her
hood
,
and
*NL*
without
stopping
,
she
went
on
into
the
dressing
room
.
``
It
's
late
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
''
she
said
,
when
she
had
gone
through
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
it
's
necessary
for
me
to
have
a
talk
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
''
she
said
,
wonderingly
.
She
came
out
from
behind
the
door
of
*NL*
the
dressing
room
,
and
looked
at
him
.
``
Why
,
what
is
it
?
What
about
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
,
sitting
down
.
``
Well
,
let
's
talk
,
if
it
's
so
necessary
.
But
it
*NL*
would
be
better
to
get
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
said
what
came
to
her
lips
,
and
marveled
,
hearing
herself
,
at
her
*NL*
own
capacity
for
lying
.
How
simple
and
natural
were
her
words
,
and
how
*NL*
likely
that
she
was
simply
sleepy
!
She
felt
herself
clad
in
an
*NL*
impenetrable
armor
of
falsehood
.
She
felt
that
some
unseen
force
had
*NL*
come
to
her
aid
and
was
supporting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
I
must
warn
you
,
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Warn
me
?
''
she
said
.
``
Of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
so
simply
,
so
brightly
,
that
anyone
who
did
not
know
*NL*
her
as
her
husband
knew
her
could
not
have
noticed
anything
unnatural
,
*NL*
either
in
the
sound
or
the
sense
of
her
words
.
But
to
him
,
knowing
her
,
*NL*
knowing
that
whenever
he
went
to
bed
five
minutes
later
than
usual
,
she
*NL*
noticed
it
,
and
asked
him
the
reason
;
to
him
,
knowing
that
every
joy
,
*NL*
every
pleasure
and
pain
that
she
felt
she
communicated
to
him
at
once
;
*NL*
to
him
,
now
to
see
that
she
did
not
care
to
notice
his
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
that
she
did
not
care
to
say
a
word
about
herself
,
meant
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
soul
,
that
had
always
hitherto
*NL*
lain
open
before
him
,
were
closed
against
him
.
More
than
that
,
he
saw
*NL*
from
her
tone
that
she
was
not
even
perturbed
at
that
,
but
as
it
were
*NL*
said
straight
out
to
him
:
``
Yes
,
it
's
shut
up
,
and
so
it
must
be
,
and
*NL*
will
be
in
future
.
''
Now
he
experienced
a
feeling
such
as
a
man
might
*NL*
have
,
returning
home
and
finding
his
own
house
locked
up
.
``
But
perhaps
*NL*
the
key
may
yet
be
found
,
''
thought
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
warn
you
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
voice
,
``
that
through
*NL*
thoughtlessness
and
lack
of
caution
you
may
cause
yourself
to
be
talked
*NL*
about
in
society
.
Your
too
animated
conversation
this
evening
with
Count
*NL*
Vronsky
''
-LRB-
he
enunciated
the
name
firmly
and
with
deliberate
emphasis
-RRB-
*NL*
``
attracted
attention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
and
looked
at
her
laughing
eyes
,
which
frightened
him
now
with
*NL*
their
impenetrable
look
,
and
,
as
he
talked
,
he
felt
all
the
uselessness
*NL*
and
idleness
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
always
like
that
,
''
she
answered
,
as
though
completely
*NL*
misapprehending
him
,
and
of
all
he
had
said
only
taking
in
the
last
*NL*
phrase
.
``
One
time
you
do
n't
like
my
being
dull
,
and
another
time
you
*NL*
do
n't
like
my
being
lively
.
I
was
n't
dull
.
Does
that
offend
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
shivered
,
and
bent
his
hands
to
make
the
joints
*NL*
crack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
do
n't
do
that
,
I
do
so
dislike
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
is
this
you
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
quietly
making
an
*NL*
effort
over
himself
,
and
restraining
the
motion
of
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
all
about
?
''
she
said
,
with
such
genuine
and
droll
*NL*
wonder
.
``
What
do
you
want
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
paused
,
and
rubbed
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
saw
that
instead
of
doing
as
he
had
intended
--
that
is
to
say
,
warning
*NL*
his
wife
against
a
mistake
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
--
he
had
*NL*
unconsciously
become
agitated
over
what
was
the
affair
of
her
*NL*
conscience
,
and
was
struggling
against
the
barrier
he
fancied
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
meant
to
say
to
you
,
''
he
went
on
coldly
and
composedly
,
*NL*
``
and
I
beg
you
to
listen
to
it
.
I
consider
jealousy
,
as
you
know
,
a
*NL*
humiliating
and
degrading
feeling
,
and
I
shall
never
allow
myself
to
be
*NL*
influenced
by
it
;
but
there
are
certain
rules
of
decorum
which
can
not
be
*NL*
disregarded
with
impunity
.
This
evening
it
was
not
I
observed
it
,
but
*NL*
judging
by
the
impression
made
on
the
company
,
everyone
observed
that
*NL*
your
conduct
and
deportment
were
not
altogether
what
could
be
desired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
positively
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Anna
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
--
``
He
*NL*
does
n't
care
,
''
she
thought
.
``
But
other
people
noticed
it
,
and
that
's
*NL*
what
upsets
him
.
''
--
``
You
're
not
well
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
and
she
got
up
,
and
would
have
gone
towards
the
door
;
but
he
moved
*NL*
forward
as
though
he
would
stop
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
ugly
and
forbidding
,
as
Anna
had
never
seen
him
.
She
*NL*
stopped
,
and
bending
her
head
back
and
on
one
side
,
began
with
her
rapid
*NL*
hand
taking
out
her
hairpins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
listening
to
what
's
to
come
,
''
she
said
,
calmly
and
*NL*
ironically
;
``
and
indeed
I
listen
with
interest
,
for
I
should
like
to
*NL*
understand
what
's
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
,
and
marveled
at
the
confident
,
calm
,
and
natural
tone
in
*NL*
which
she
was
speaking
,
and
the
choice
of
the
words
she
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
enter
into
all
the
details
of
your
feelings
I
have
no
right
,
and
*NL*
besides
,
I
regard
that
as
useless
and
even
harmful
,
''
began
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
``
Ferreting
in
one
's
soul
,
one
often
ferrets
out
*NL*
something
that
might
have
lain
there
unnoticed
.
Your
feelings
are
an
*NL*
affair
of
your
own
conscience
;
but
I
am
in
duty
bound
to
you
,
to
myself
,
*NL*
and
to
God
,
to
point
out
to
you
your
duties
.
Our
life
has
been
joined
,
*NL*
not
by
man
,
but
by
God
.
That
union
can
only
be
severed
by
a
crime
,
and
a
*NL*
crime
of
that
nature
brings
its
own
chastisement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
a
word
.
And
,
oh
dear
!
how
sleepy
I
am
,
unluckily
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
rapidly
passing
her
hand
through
her
hair
,
feeling
for
the
*NL*
remaining
hairpins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
for
God
's
sake
do
n't
speak
like
that
!
''
he
said
gently
.
``
Perhaps
I
*NL*
am
mistaken
,
but
believe
me
,
what
I
say
,
I
say
as
much
for
myself
as
for
*NL*
you
.
I
am
your
husband
,
and
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
her
face
fell
,
and
the
mocking
gleam
in
her
eyes
died
*NL*
away
;
but
the
word
_
love
_
threw
her
into
revolt
again
.
She
thought
:
*NL*
``
Love
?
Can
he
love
?
If
he
had
n't
heard
there
was
such
a
thing
as
love
,
*NL*
he
would
never
have
used
the
word
.
He
does
n't
even
know
what
love
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
really
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
said
.
``
Define
*NL*
what
it
is
you
find
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
let
me
say
all
I
have
to
say
.
I
love
you
.
But
I
am
not
speaking
*NL*
of
myself
;
the
most
important
persons
in
this
matter
are
our
son
and
*NL*
yourself
.
It
may
very
well
be
,
I
repeat
,
that
my
words
seem
to
you
*NL*
utterly
unnecessary
and
out
of
place
;
it
may
be
that
they
are
called
*NL*
forth
by
my
mistaken
impression
.
In
that
case
,
I
beg
you
to
forgive
me
.
*NL*
But
if
you
are
conscious
yourself
of
even
the
smallest
foundation
for
*NL*
them
,
then
I
beg
you
to
think
a
little
,
and
if
your
heart
prompts
you
,
*NL*
to
speak
out
to
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
unconsciously
saying
something
utterly
unlike
*NL*
what
he
had
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
to
say
.
And
besides
,
''
she
said
hurriedly
,
with
*NL*
difficulty
repressing
a
smile
,
``
it
's
really
time
to
be
in
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sighed
,
and
,
without
saying
more
,
went
into
the
*NL*
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
into
the
bedroom
,
he
was
already
in
bed
.
His
lips
were
*NL*
sternly
compressed
,
and
his
eyes
looked
away
from
her
.
Anna
got
into
her
*NL*
bed
,
and
lay
expecting
every
minute
that
he
would
begin
to
speak
to
her
*NL*
again
.
She
both
feared
his
speaking
and
wished
for
it
.
But
he
was
*NL*
silent
.
She
waited
for
a
long
while
without
moving
,
and
had
forgotten
*NL*
about
him
.
She
thought
of
that
other
;
she
pictured
him
,
and
felt
how
her
*NL*
heart
was
flooded
with
emotion
and
guilty
delight
at
the
thought
of
him
.
*NL*
Suddenly
she
heard
an
even
,
tranquil
snore
.
For
the
first
instant
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
appalled
at
his
own
snoring
,
and
*NL*
ceased
;
but
after
an
interval
of
two
breathings
the
snore
sounded
again
,
*NL*
with
a
new
tranquil
rhythm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
late
,
it
's
late
,
''
she
whispered
with
a
smile
.
A
long
while
she
*NL*
lay
,
not
moving
,
with
open
eyes
,
whose
brilliance
she
almost
fancied
she
*NL*
could
herself
see
in
the
darkness
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
a
new
life
began
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
for
his
*NL*
wife
.
Nothing
special
happened
.
Anna
went
out
into
society
,
as
she
had
*NL*
always
done
,
was
particularly
often
at
Princess
Betsy
's
,
and
met
Vronsky
*NL*
everywhere
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
this
,
but
could
do
nothing
.
All
*NL*
his
efforts
to
draw
her
into
open
discussion
she
confronted
with
a
*NL*
barrier
which
he
could
not
penetrate
,
made
up
of
a
sort
of
amused
*NL*
perplexity
.
Outwardly
everything
was
the
same
,
but
their
inner
relations
*NL*
were
completely
changed
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
a
man
of
great
power
in
*NL*
the
world
of
politics
,
felt
himself
helpless
in
this
.
Like
an
ox
with
*NL*
head
bent
,
submissively
he
awaited
the
blow
which
he
felt
was
lifted
*NL*
over
him
.
Every
time
he
began
to
think
about
it
,
he
felt
that
he
must
*NL*
try
once
more
,
that
by
kindness
,
tenderness
,
and
persuasion
there
was
*NL*
still
hope
of
saving
her
,
of
bringing
her
back
to
herself
,
and
every
day
*NL*
he
made
ready
to
talk
to
her
.
But
every
time
he
began
talking
to
her
,
he
*NL*
felt
that
the
spirit
of
evil
and
deceit
,
which
had
taken
possession
of
*NL*
her
,
had
possession
of
him
too
,
and
he
talked
to
her
in
a
tone
quite
*NL*
unlike
that
in
which
he
had
meant
to
talk
.
Involuntarily
he
talked
to
*NL*
her
in
his
habitual
tone
of
jeering
at
anyone
who
should
say
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
.
And
in
that
tone
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
needed
to
be
said
*NL*
to
her
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
for
Vronsky
had
been
almost
a
whole
year
the
one
absorbing
*NL*
desire
of
his
life
,
replacing
all
his
old
desires
;
that
which
for
Anna
*NL*
had
been
an
impossible
,
terrible
,
and
even
for
that
reason
more
*NL*
entrancing
dream
of
bliss
,
that
desire
had
been
fulfilled
.
He
stood
*NL*
before
her
,
pale
,
his
lower
jaw
quivering
,
and
besought
her
to
be
calm
,
*NL*
not
knowing
how
or
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
!
Anna
!
''
he
said
with
a
choking
voice
,
``
Anna
,
for
pity
's
sake
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
louder
he
spoke
,
the
lower
she
dropped
her
once
proud
and
gay
,
*NL*
now
shame-stricken
head
,
and
she
bowed
down
and
sank
from
the
sofa
where
*NL*
she
was
sitting
,
down
on
the
floor
,
at
his
feet
;
she
would
have
fallen
*NL*
on
the
carpet
if
he
had
not
held
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
Forgive
me
!
''
she
said
,
sobbing
,
pressing
his
hands
to
her
*NL*
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
so
sinful
,
so
guilty
,
that
nothing
was
left
her
but
to
*NL*
humiliate
herself
and
beg
forgiveness
;
and
as
now
there
was
no
one
in
*NL*
her
life
but
him
,
to
him
she
addressed
her
prayer
for
forgiveness
.
*NL*
Looking
at
him
,
she
had
a
physical
sense
of
her
humiliation
,
and
she
*NL*
could
say
nothing
more
.
He
felt
what
a
murderer
must
feel
,
when
he
sees
*NL*
the
body
he
has
robbed
of
life
.
That
body
,
robbed
by
him
of
life
,
was
*NL*
their
love
,
the
first
stage
of
their
love
.
There
was
something
awful
and
*NL*
revolting
in
the
memory
of
what
had
been
bought
at
this
fearful
price
of
*NL*
shame
.
Shame
at
their
spiritual
nakedness
crushed
her
and
infected
him
.
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
all
the
murderer
's
horror
before
the
body
of
his
victim
,
*NL*
he
must
hack
it
to
pieces
,
hide
the
body
,
must
use
what
he
has
gained
by
*NL*
his
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
fury
,
as
it
were
with
passion
,
the
murderer
falls
on
the
body
,
*NL*
and
drags
it
and
hacks
at
it
;
so
he
covered
her
face
and
shoulders
with
*NL*
kisses
.
She
held
his
hand
,
and
did
not
stir
.
``
Yes
,
these
kisses
--
that
is
*NL*
what
has
been
bought
by
this
shame
.
Yes
,
and
one
hand
,
which
will
always
*NL*
be
mine
--
the
hand
of
my
accomplice
.
''
She
lifted
up
that
hand
and
kissed
*NL*
it
.
He
sank
on
his
knees
and
tried
to
see
her
face
;
but
she
hid
it
,
and
*NL*
said
nothing
.
At
last
,
as
though
making
an
effort
over
herself
,
she
got
*NL*
up
and
pushed
him
away
.
Her
face
was
still
as
beautiful
,
but
it
was
only
*NL*
the
more
pitiful
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
over
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
have
nothing
but
you
.
Remember
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
forget
what
is
my
whole
life
.
For
one
instant
of
this
*NL*
happiness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happiness
!
''
she
said
with
horror
and
loathing
and
her
horror
*NL*
unconsciously
infected
him
.
``
For
pity
's
sake
,
not
a
word
,
not
a
word
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
quickly
and
moved
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
more
,
''
she
repeated
,
and
with
a
look
of
chill
despair
,
*NL*
incomprehensible
to
him
,
she
parted
from
him
.
She
felt
that
at
that
*NL*
moment
she
could
not
put
into
words
the
sense
of
shame
,
of
rapture
,
and
*NL*
of
horror
at
this
stepping
into
a
new
life
,
and
she
did
not
want
to
*NL*
speak
of
it
,
to
vulgarize
this
feeling
by
inappropriate
words
.
But
later
*NL*
too
,
and
the
next
day
and
the
third
day
,
she
still
found
no
words
in
*NL*
which
she
could
express
the
complexity
of
her
feelings
;
indeed
,
she
*NL*
could
not
even
find
thoughts
in
which
she
could
clearly
think
out
all
*NL*
that
was
in
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
to
herself
:
``
No
,
just
now
I
ca
n't
think
of
it
,
later
on
,
when
I
*NL*
am
calmer
.
''
But
this
calm
for
thought
never
came
;
every
time
the
thought
*NL*
rose
of
what
she
had
done
and
what
would
happen
to
her
,
and
what
she
*NL*
ought
to
do
,
a
horror
came
over
her
and
she
drove
those
thoughts
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Later
,
later
,
''
she
said
--
``
when
I
am
calmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
dreams
,
when
she
had
no
control
over
her
thoughts
,
her
position
*NL*
presented
itself
to
her
in
all
its
hideous
nakedness
.
One
dream
haunted
*NL*
her
almost
every
night
.
She
dreamed
that
both
were
her
husbands
at
once
,
*NL*
that
both
were
lavishing
caresses
on
her
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
*NL*
weeping
,
kissing
her
hands
,
and
saying
,
``
How
happy
we
are
now
!
''
And
*NL*
Alexey
Vronsky
was
there
too
,
and
he
too
was
her
husband
.
And
she
was
*NL*
marveling
that
it
had
once
seemed
impossible
to
her
,
was
explaining
to
*NL*
them
,
laughing
,
that
this
was
ever
so
much
simpler
,
and
that
now
both
of
*NL*
them
were
happy
and
contented
.
But
this
dream
weighed
on
her
like
a
*NL*
nightmare
,
and
she
awoke
from
it
in
terror
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
days
after
his
return
from
Moscow
,
whenever
Levin
shuddered
*NL*
and
grew
red
,
remembering
the
disgrace
of
his
rejection
,
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
:
``
This
was
just
how
I
used
to
shudder
and
blush
,
thinking
myself
*NL*
utterly
lost
,
when
I
was
plucked
in
physics
and
did
not
get
my
remove
;
*NL*
and
how
I
thought
myself
utterly
ruined
after
I
had
mismanaged
that
*NL*
affair
of
my
sister
's
that
was
entrusted
to
me
.
And
yet
,
now
that
years
*NL*
have
passed
,
I
recall
it
and
wonder
that
it
could
distress
me
so
much
.
*NL*
It
will
be
the
same
thing
too
with
this
trouble
.
Time
will
go
by
and
I
*NL*
shall
not
mind
about
this
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
three
months
had
passed
and
he
had
not
left
off
minding
about
it
;
*NL*
and
it
was
as
painful
for
him
to
think
of
it
as
it
had
been
those
first
*NL*
days
.
He
could
not
be
at
peace
because
after
dreaming
so
long
of
family
*NL*
life
,
and
feeling
himself
so
ripe
for
it
,
he
was
still
not
married
,
and
*NL*
was
further
than
ever
from
marriage
.
He
was
painfully
conscious
himself
,
*NL*
as
were
all
about
him
,
that
at
his
years
it
is
not
well
for
man
to
be
*NL*
alone
.
He
remembered
how
before
starting
for
Moscow
he
had
once
said
to
*NL*
his
cowman
Nikolay
,
a
simple-hearted
peasant
,
whom
he
liked
talking
to
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
Nikolay
!
I
mean
to
get
married
,
''
and
how
Nikolay
had
promptly
*NL*
answered
,
as
of
a
matter
on
which
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
:
``
And
*NL*
high
time
too
,
Konstantin
Demitrievitch
.
''
But
marriage
had
now
become
*NL*
further
off
than
ever
.
The
place
was
taken
,
and
whenever
he
tried
to
*NL*
imagine
any
of
the
girls
he
knew
in
that
place
,
he
felt
that
it
was
*NL*
utterly
impossible
.
Moreover
,
the
recollection
of
the
rejection
and
the
*NL*
part
he
had
played
in
the
affair
tortured
him
with
shame
.
However
often
*NL*
he
told
himself
that
he
was
in
no
wise
to
blame
in
it
,
that
*NL*
recollection
,
like
other
humiliating
reminiscences
of
a
similar
kind
,
*NL*
made
him
twinge
and
blush
.
There
had
been
in
his
past
,
as
in
every
*NL*
man
's
,
actions
,
recognized
by
him
as
bad
,
for
which
his
conscience
ought
*NL*
to
have
tormented
him
;
but
the
memory
of
these
evil
actions
was
far
from
*NL*
causing
him
so
much
suffering
as
those
trivial
but
humiliating
*NL*
reminiscences
.
These
wounds
never
healed
.
And
with
these
memories
was
*NL*
now
ranged
his
rejection
and
the
pitiful
position
in
which
he
must
have
*NL*
appeared
to
others
that
evening
.
But
time
and
work
did
their
part
.
*NL*
Bitter
memories
were
more
and
more
covered
up
by
the
incidents
--
paltry
*NL*
in
his
eyes
,
but
really
important
--
of
his
country
life
.
Every
week
he
*NL*
thought
less
often
of
Kitty
.
He
was
impatiently
looking
forward
to
the
*NL*
news
that
she
was
married
,
or
just
going
to
be
married
,
hoping
that
such
*NL*
news
would
,
like
having
a
tooth
out
,
completely
cure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
spring
came
on
,
beautiful
and
kindly
,
without
the
delays
and
*NL*
treacheries
of
spring
,
--
one
of
those
rare
springs
in
which
plants
,
*NL*
beasts
,
and
man
rejoice
alike
.
This
lovely
spring
roused
Levin
still
*NL*
more
,
and
strengthened
him
in
his
resolution
of
renouncing
all
his
past
*NL*
and
building
up
his
lonely
life
firmly
and
independently
.
Though
many
of
*NL*
the
plans
with
which
he
had
returned
to
the
country
had
not
been
carried
*NL*
out
,
still
his
most
important
resolution
--
that
of
purity
--
had
been
kept
*NL*
by
him
.
He
was
free
from
that
shame
,
which
had
usually
harassed
him
*NL*
after
a
fall
;
and
he
could
look
everyone
straight
in
the
face
.
In
*NL*
February
he
had
received
a
letter
from
Marya
Nikolaevna
telling
him
that
*NL*
his
brother
Nikolay
's
health
was
getting
worse
,
but
that
he
would
not
*NL*
take
advice
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
letter
Levin
went
to
Moscow
to
*NL*
his
brother
's
and
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
see
a
doctor
and
to
go
*NL*
to
a
watering-place
abroad
.
He
succeeded
so
well
in
persuading
his
*NL*
brother
,
and
in
lending
him
money
for
the
journey
without
irritating
*NL*
him
,
that
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
in
that
matter
.
In
addition
to
*NL*
his
farming
,
which
called
for
special
attention
in
spring
,
and
in
*NL*
addition
to
reading
,
Levin
had
begun
that
winter
a
work
on
agriculture
,
*NL*
the
plan
of
which
turned
on
taking
into
account
the
character
of
the
*NL*
laborer
on
the
land
as
one
of
the
unalterable
data
of
the
question
,
like
*NL*
the
climate
and
the
soil
,
and
consequently
deducing
all
the
principles
*NL*
of
scientific
culture
,
not
simply
from
the
data
of
soil
and
climate
,
but
*NL*
from
the
data
of
soil
,
climate
,
and
a
certain
unalterable
character
of
*NL*
the
laborer
.
Thus
,
in
spite
of
his
solitude
,
or
in
consequence
of
his
*NL*
solitude
,
his
life
was
exceedingly
full
.
Only
rarely
he
suffered
from
an
*NL*
unsatisfied
desire
to
communicate
his
stray
ideas
to
someone
besides
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
With
her
indeed
he
not
infrequently
fell
into
*NL*
discussion
upon
physics
,
the
theory
of
agriculture
,
and
especially
*NL*
philosophy
;
philosophy
was
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
favorite
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
was
slow
in
unfolding
.
For
the
last
few
weeks
it
had
been
*NL*
steadily
fine
frosty
weather
.
In
the
daytime
it
thawed
in
the
sun
,
but
*NL*
at
night
there
were
even
seven
degrees
of
frost
.
There
was
such
a
frozen
*NL*
surface
on
the
snow
that
they
drove
the
wagons
anywhere
off
the
roads
.
*NL*
Easter
came
in
the
snow
.
Then
all
of
a
sudden
,
on
Easter
Monday
,
a
warm
*NL*
wind
sprang
up
,
storm
clouds
swooped
down
,
and
for
three
days
and
three
*NL*
nights
the
warm
,
driving
rain
fell
in
streams
.
On
Thursday
the
wind
*NL*
dropped
,
and
a
thick
gray
fog
brooded
over
the
land
as
though
hiding
the
*NL*
mysteries
of
the
transformations
that
were
being
wrought
in
nature
.
*NL*
Behind
the
fog
there
was
the
flowing
of
water
,
the
cracking
and
floating
*NL*
of
ice
,
the
swift
rush
of
turbid
,
foaming
torrents
;
and
on
the
following
*NL*
Monday
,
in
the
evening
,
the
fog
parted
,
the
storm
clouds
split
up
into
*NL*
little
curling
crests
of
cloud
,
the
sky
cleared
,
and
the
real
spring
had
*NL*
come
.
In
the
morning
the
sun
rose
brilliant
and
quickly
wore
away
the
*NL*
thin
layer
of
ice
that
covered
the
water
,
and
all
the
warm
air
was
*NL*
quivering
with
the
steam
that
rose
up
from
the
quickened
earth
.
The
old
*NL*
grass
looked
greener
,
and
the
young
grass
thrust
up
its
tiny
blades
;
the
*NL*
buds
of
the
guelder-rose
and
of
the
currant
and
the
sticky
birch-buds
*NL*
were
swollen
with
sap
,
and
an
exploring
bee
was
humming
about
the
golden
*NL*
blossoms
that
studded
the
willow
.
Larks
trilled
unseen
above
the
velvety
*NL*
green
fields
and
the
ice-covered
stubble-land
;
peewits
wailed
over
the
*NL*
low
lands
and
marshes
flooded
by
the
pools
;
cranes
and
wild
geese
flew
*NL*
high
across
the
sky
uttering
their
spring
calls
.
The
cattle
,
bald
in
*NL*
patches
where
the
new
hair
had
not
grown
yet
,
lowed
in
the
pastures
;
the
*NL*
bowlegged
lambs
frisked
round
their
bleating
mothers
.
Nimble
children
*NL*
ran
about
the
drying
paths
,
covered
with
the
prints
of
bare
feet
.
There
*NL*
was
a
merry
chatter
of
peasant
women
over
their
linen
at
the
pond
,
and
*NL*
the
ring
of
axes
in
the
yard
,
where
the
peasants
were
repairing
ploughs
*NL*
and
harrows
.
The
real
spring
had
come
.

Levin
put
on
his
big
boots
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
cloth
jacket
,
*NL*
instead
of
his
fur
cloak
,
and
went
out
to
look
after
his
farm
,
stepping
*NL*
over
streams
of
water
that
flashed
in
the
sunshine
and
dazzled
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
treading
one
minute
on
ice
and
the
next
into
sticky
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
is
the
time
of
plans
and
projects
.
And
,
as
he
came
out
into
the
*NL*
farmyard
,
Levin
,
like
a
tree
in
spring
that
knows
not
what
form
will
be
*NL*
taken
by
the
young
shoots
and
twigs
imprisoned
in
its
swelling
buds
,
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
undertakings
he
was
going
to
begin
upon
now
in
the
farm
*NL*
work
that
was
so
dear
to
him
.
But
he
felt
that
he
was
full
of
the
most
*NL*
splendid
plans
and
projects
.
First
of
all
he
went
to
the
cattle
.
The
*NL*
cows
had
been
let
out
into
their
paddock
,
and
their
smooth
sides
were
*NL*
already
shining
with
their
new
,
sleek
,
spring
coats
;
they
basked
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
and
lowed
to
go
to
the
meadow
.
Levin
gazed
admiringly
at
the
*NL*
cows
he
knew
so
intimately
to
the
minutest
detail
of
their
condition
,
*NL*
and
gave
orders
for
them
to
be
driven
out
into
the
meadow
,
and
the
*NL*
calves
to
be
let
into
the
paddock
.
The
herdsman
ran
gaily
to
get
ready
*NL*
for
the
meadow
.
The
cowherd
girls
,
picking
up
their
petticoats
,
ran
*NL*
splashing
through
the
mud
with
bare
legs
,
still
white
,
not
yet
brown
*NL*
from
the
sun
,
waving
brush
wood
in
their
hands
,
chasing
the
calves
that
*NL*
frolicked
in
the
mirth
of
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
admiring
the
young
ones
of
that
year
,
who
were
particularly
*NL*
fine
--
the
early
calves
were
the
size
of
a
peasant
's
cow
,
and
Pava
's
*NL*
daughter
,
at
three
months
old
,
was
as
big
as
a
yearling
--
Levin
gave
*NL*
orders
for
a
trough
to
be
brought
out
and
for
them
to
be
fed
in
the
*NL*
paddock
.
But
it
appeared
that
as
the
paddock
had
not
been
used
during
*NL*
the
winter
,
the
hurdles
made
in
the
autumn
for
it
were
broken
.
He
sent
*NL*
for
the
carpenter
,
who
,
according
to
his
orders
,
ought
to
have
been
at
*NL*
work
at
the
thrashing
machine
.
But
it
appeared
that
the
carpenter
was
*NL*
repairing
the
harrows
,
which
ought
to
have
been
repaired
before
Lent
.
*NL*
This
was
very
annoying
to
Levin
.
It
was
annoying
to
come
upon
that
*NL*
everlasting
slovenliness
in
the
farm
work
against
which
he
had
been
*NL*
striving
with
all
his
might
for
so
many
years
.
The
hurdles
,
as
he
*NL*
ascertained
,
being
not
wanted
in
winter
,
had
been
carried
to
the
*NL*
cart-horses
'
stable
;
and
there
broken
,
as
they
were
of
light
*NL*
construction
,
only
meant
for
feeding
calves
.
Moreover
,
it
was
apparent
*NL*
also
that
the
harrows
and
all
the
agricultural
implements
,
which
he
had
*NL*
directed
to
be
looked
over
and
repaired
in
the
winter
,
for
which
very
*NL*
purpose
he
had
hired
three
carpenters
,
had
not
been
put
into
repair
,
and
*NL*
the
harrows
were
being
repaired
when
they
ought
to
have
been
harrowing
*NL*
the
field
.
Levin
sent
for
his
bailiff
,
but
immediately
went
off
himself
*NL*
to
look
for
him
.
The
bailiff
,
beaming
all
over
,
like
everyone
that
day
,
*NL*
in
a
sheepskin
bordered
with
astrachan
,
came
out
of
the
barn
,
twisting
a
*NL*
bit
of
straw
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
n't
the
carpenter
at
the
thrashing
machine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
meant
to
tell
you
yesterday
,
the
harrows
want
repairing
.
Here
*NL*
it
's
time
they
got
to
work
in
the
fields
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
were
they
doing
in
the
winter
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
you
want
the
carpenter
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
hurdles
for
the
calves
'
paddock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ordered
them
to
be
got
ready
.
What
would
you
have
with
those
*NL*
peasants
!
''
said
the
bailiff
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
those
peasants
but
this
bailiff
!
''
said
Levin
,
getting
angry
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
I
keep
you
for
?
''
he
cried
.
But
,
bethinking
himself
that
*NL*
this
would
not
help
matters
,
he
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
sentence
,
and
merely
sighed
.
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
?
Can
sowing
begin
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
Turkin
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
they
might
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
clover
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sent
Vassily
and
Mishka
;
they
're
sowing
.
Only
I
do
n't
know
if
*NL*
they
'll
manage
to
get
through
;
it
's
so
slushy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
acres
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
fifteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
sow
all
?
''
cried
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
they
were
only
sowing
the
clover
on
fifteen
acres
,
not
on
all
the
*NL*
forty-five
,
was
still
more
annoying
to
him
.
Clover
,
as
he
knew
,
both
*NL*
from
books
and
from
his
own
experience
,
never
did
well
except
when
it
*NL*
was
sown
as
early
as
possible
,
almost
in
the
snow
.
And
yet
Levin
could
*NL*
never
get
this
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
to
send
.
What
would
you
have
with
such
a
set
of
*NL*
peasants
?
Three
have
n't
turned
up
.
And
there
's
Semyon
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
should
have
taken
some
men
from
the
thatching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
I
have
,
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
peasants
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
are
making
compote
''
-LRB-
which
meant
compost
-RRB-
,
``
four
are
shifting
the
*NL*
oats
for
fear
of
a
touch
of
mildew
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
knew
very
well
that
``
a
touch
of
mildew
''
meant
that
his
English
*NL*
seed
oats
were
already
ruined
.
Again
they
had
not
done
as
he
had
*NL*
ordered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
but
I
told
you
during
Lent
to
put
in
pipes
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
yourself
out
;
we
shall
get
it
all
done
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
waved
his
hand
angrily
,
went
into
the
granary
to
glance
at
the
*NL*
oats
,
and
then
to
the
stable
.
The
oats
were
not
yet
spoiled
.
But
the
*NL*
peasants
were
carrying
the
oats
in
spades
when
they
might
simply
let
*NL*
them
slide
down
into
the
lower
granary
;
and
arranging
for
this
to
be
*NL*
done
,
and
taking
two
workmen
from
there
for
sowing
clover
,
Levin
got
*NL*
over
his
vexation
with
the
bailiff
.
Indeed
,
it
was
such
a
lovely
day
*NL*
that
one
could
not
be
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ignat
!
''
he
called
to
the
coachman
,
who
,
with
his
sleeves
tucked
up
,
was
*NL*
washing
the
carriage
wheels
,
``
saddle
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
it
be
Kolpik
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
saddling
his
horse
,
Levin
again
called
up
the
bailiff
,
*NL*
who
was
hanging
about
in
sight
,
to
make
it
up
with
him
,
and
began
*NL*
talking
to
him
about
the
spring
operations
before
them
,
and
his
plans
*NL*
for
the
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wagons
were
to
begin
carting
manure
earlier
,
so
as
to
get
all
done
*NL*
before
the
early
mowing
.
And
the
ploughing
of
the
further
land
to
go
on
*NL*
without
a
break
so
as
to
let
it
ripen
lying
fallow
.
And
the
mowing
to
be
*NL*
all
done
by
hired
labor
,
not
on
half-profits
.
The
bailiff
listened
*NL*
attentively
,
and
obviously
made
an
effort
to
approve
of
his
employer
's
*NL*
projects
.
But
still
he
had
that
look
Levin
knew
so
well
that
always
*NL*
irritated
him
,
a
look
of
hopelessness
and
despondency
.
That
look
said
:
*NL*
``
That
's
all
very
well
,
but
as
God
wills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
mortified
Levin
so
much
as
that
tone
.
But
it
was
the
tone
common
*NL*
to
all
the
bailiffs
he
had
ever
had
.
They
had
all
taken
up
that
attitude
*NL*
to
his
plans
,
and
so
now
he
was
not
angered
by
it
,
but
mortified
,
and
*NL*
felt
all
the
more
roused
to
struggle
against
this
,
as
it
seemed
,
*NL*
elemental
force
continually
ranged
against
him
,
for
which
he
could
find
*NL*
no
other
expression
than
``
as
God
wills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
can
manage
it
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
said
the
bailiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ever
should
n't
you
manage
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
positively
must
have
another
fifteen
laborers
.
And
they
do
n't
turn
*NL*
up
.
There
were
some
here
today
asking
seventy
roubles
for
the
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
silent
.
Again
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
that
opposing
*NL*
force
.
He
knew
that
however
much
they
tried
,
they
could
not
hire
more
*NL*
than
forty
--
thirty-seven
perhaps
or
thirty-eight
--
laborers
for
a
*NL*
reasonable
sum
.
Some
forty
had
been
taken
on
,
and
there
were
no
more
.
*NL*
But
still
he
could
not
help
struggling
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
to
Sury
,
to
Tchefirovka
;
if
they
do
n't
come
we
must
look
for
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
send
,
to
be
sure
,
''
said
Vassily
Fedorovitch
despondently
.
``
But
*NL*
there
are
the
horses
,
too
,
they
're
not
good
for
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
get
some
more
.
I
know
,
of
course
,
''
Levin
added
laughing
,
``
you
*NL*
always
want
to
do
with
as
little
and
as
poor
quality
as
possible
;
but
*NL*
this
year
I
'm
not
going
to
let
you
have
things
your
own
way
.
I
'll
see
to
*NL*
everything
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
think
you
take
much
rest
as
it
is
.
It
cheers
us
up
to
work
*NL*
under
the
master
's
eye
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
they
're
sowing
clover
behind
the
Birch
Dale
?
I
'll
go
and
have
a
look
*NL*
at
them
,
''
he
said
,
getting
on
to
the
little
bay
cob
,
Kolpik
,
who
was
led
*NL*
up
by
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
get
across
the
streams
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
the
*NL*
coachman
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
'll
go
by
the
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
rode
through
the
slush
of
the
farmyard
to
the
gate
and
out
*NL*
into
the
open
country
,
his
good
little
horse
,
after
his
long
inactivity
,
*NL*
stepping
out
gallantly
,
snorting
over
the
pools
,
and
asking
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
for
guidance
.
If
Levin
had
felt
happy
before
in
the
cattle
pens
and
*NL*
farmyard
,
he
felt
happier
yet
in
the
open
country
.
Swaying
rhythmically
*NL*
with
the
ambling
paces
of
his
good
little
cob
,
drinking
in
the
warm
yet
*NL*
fresh
scent
of
the
snow
and
the
air
,
as
he
rode
through
his
forest
over
*NL*
the
crumbling
,
wasted
snow
,
still
left
in
parts
,
and
covered
with
*NL*
dissolving
tracks
,
he
rejoiced
over
every
tree
,
with
the
moss
reviving
*NL*
on
its
bark
and
the
buds
swelling
on
its
shoots
.
When
he
came
out
of
the
*NL*
forest
,
in
the
immense
plain
before
him
,
his
grass
fields
stretched
in
*NL*
an
unbroken
carpet
of
green
,
without
one
bare
place
or
swamp
,
only
*NL*
spotted
here
and
there
in
the
hollows
with
patches
of
melting
snow
.
He
*NL*
was
not
put
out
of
temper
even
by
the
sight
of
the
peasants
'
horses
and
*NL*
colts
trampling
down
his
young
grass
-LRB-
he
told
a
peasant
he
met
to
drive
*NL*
them
out
-RRB-
,
nor
by
the
sarcastic
and
stupid
reply
of
the
peasant
Ipat
,
*NL*
whom
he
met
on
the
way
,
and
asked
,
``
Well
,
Ipat
,
shall
we
soon
be
*NL*
sowing
?
''
``
We
must
get
the
ploughing
done
first
,
Konstantin
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
,
''
answered
Ipat
.
The
further
he
rode
,
the
happier
he
*NL*
became
,
and
plans
for
the
land
rose
to
his
mind
each
better
than
the
*NL*
last
;
to
plant
all
his
fields
with
hedges
along
the
southern
borders
,
so
*NL*
that
the
snow
should
not
lie
under
them
;
to
divide
them
up
into
six
*NL*
fields
of
arable
and
three
of
pasture
and
hay
;
to
build
a
cattle
yard
at
*NL*
the
further
end
of
the
estate
,
and
to
dig
a
pond
and
to
construct
*NL*
movable
pens
for
the
cattle
as
a
means
of
manuring
the
land
.
And
then
*NL*
eight
hundred
acres
of
wheat
,
three
hundred
of
potatoes
,
and
four
*NL*
hundred
of
clover
,
and
not
one
acre
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absorbed
in
such
dreams
,
carefully
keeping
his
horse
by
the
hedges
,
so
*NL*
as
not
to
trample
his
young
crops
,
he
rode
up
to
the
laborers
who
had
*NL*
been
sent
to
sow
clover
.
A
cart
with
the
seed
in
it
was
standing
,
not
at
*NL*
the
edge
,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
crop
,
and
the
winter
corn
had
been
*NL*
torn
up
by
the
wheels
and
trampled
by
the
horse
.
Both
the
laborers
were
*NL*
sitting
in
the
hedge
,
probably
smoking
a
pipe
together
.
The
earth
in
the
*NL*
cart
,
with
which
the
seed
was
mixed
,
was
not
crushed
to
powder
,
but
*NL*
crusted
together
or
adhering
in
clods
.
Seeing
the
master
,
the
laborer
,
*NL*
Vassily
,
went
towards
the
cart
,
while
Mishka
set
to
work
sowing
.
This
*NL*
was
not
as
it
should
be
,
but
with
the
laborers
Levin
seldom
lost
his
*NL*
temper
.
When
Vassily
came
up
,
Levin
told
him
to
lead
the
horse
to
the
*NL*
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
sir
,
it
'll
spring
up
again
,
''
responded
Vassily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
argue
,
''
said
Levin
,
``
but
do
as
you
're
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
Vassily
,
and
he
took
the
horse
's
head
.
``
What
a
*NL*
sowing
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
he
said
,
hesitating
;
``
first
rate
.
Only
*NL*
it
's
a
work
to
get
about
!
You
drag
a
ton
of
earth
on
your
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
you
have
earth
that
's
not
sifted
?
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
crumble
it
up
,
''
answered
Vassily
,
taking
up
some
seed
and
*NL*
rolling
the
earth
in
his
palms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vassily
was
not
to
blame
for
their
having
filled
up
his
cart
with
*NL*
unsifted
earth
,
but
still
it
was
annoying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
more
than
once
already
tried
a
way
he
knew
for
stifling
his
*NL*
anger
,
and
turning
all
that
seemed
dark
right
again
,
and
he
tried
that
*NL*
way
now
.
He
watched
how
Mishka
strode
along
,
swinging
the
huge
clods
of
*NL*
earth
that
clung
to
each
foot
;
and
getting
off
his
horse
,
he
took
the
*NL*
sieve
from
Vassily
and
started
sowing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
stop
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vassily
pointed
to
the
mark
with
his
foot
,
and
Levin
went
forward
as
*NL*
best
he
could
,
scattering
the
seed
on
the
land
.
Walking
was
as
difficult
*NL*
as
on
a
bog
,
and
by
the
time
Levin
had
ended
the
row
he
was
in
a
great
*NL*
heat
,
and
he
stopped
and
gave
up
the
sieve
to
Vassily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
master
,
when
summer
's
here
,
mind
you
do
n't
scold
me
for
these
*NL*
rows
,
''
said
Vassily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
said
Levin
cheerily
,
already
feeling
the
effect
of
his
method
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
'll
see
in
the
summer
time
.
It
'll
look
different
.
Look
you
*NL*
where
I
sowed
last
spring
.
How
I
did
work
at
it
!
I
do
my
best
,
*NL*
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
d'ye
see
,
as
I
would
for
my
own
father
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
bad
work
myself
,
nor
would
I
let
another
man
do
it
.
What
's
good
for
*NL*
the
master
's
good
for
us
too
.
To
look
out
yonder
now
,
''
said
Vassily
,
*NL*
pointing
,
``
it
does
one
's
heart
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lovely
spring
,
Vassily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
a
spring
such
as
the
old
men
do
n't
remember
the
like
of
.
I
*NL*
was
up
home
;
an
old
man
up
there
has
sown
wheat
too
,
about
an
acre
of
*NL*
it
.
He
was
saying
you
would
n't
know
it
from
rye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
sowing
wheat
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sir
,
it
was
you
taught
us
the
year
before
last
.
You
gave
me
two
*NL*
measures
.
We
sold
about
eight
bushels
and
sowed
a
rood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mind
you
crumble
up
the
clods
,
''
said
Levin
,
going
towards
his
*NL*
horse
,
``
and
keep
an
eye
on
Mishka
.
And
if
there
's
a
good
crop
you
shall
*NL*
have
half
a
rouble
for
every
acre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humbly
thankful
.
We
are
very
well
content
,
sir
,
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
towards
the
field
where
was
last
year
's
*NL*
clover
,
and
the
one
which
was
ploughed
ready
for
the
spring
corn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crop
of
clover
coming
up
in
the
stubble
was
magnificent
.
It
had
*NL*
survived
everything
,
and
stood
up
vividly
green
through
the
broken
*NL*
stalks
of
last
year
's
wheat
.
The
horse
sank
in
up
to
the
pasterns
,
and
*NL*
he
drew
each
hoof
with
a
sucking
sound
out
of
the
half-thawed
ground
.
*NL*
Over
the
ploughland
riding
was
utterly
impossible
;
the
horse
could
only
*NL*
keep
a
foothold
where
there
was
ice
,
and
in
the
thawing
furrows
he
sank
*NL*
deep
in
at
each
step
.
The
ploughland
was
in
splendid
condition
;
in
a
*NL*
couple
of
days
it
would
be
fit
for
harrowing
and
sowing
.
Everything
was
*NL*
capital
,
everything
was
cheering
.
Levin
rode
back
across
the
streams
,
*NL*
hoping
the
water
would
have
gone
down
.
And
he
did
in
fact
get
across
,
*NL*
and
startled
two
ducks
.
``
There
must
be
snipe
too
,
''
he
thought
,
and
just
*NL*
as
he
reached
the
turning
homewards
he
met
the
forest
keeper
,
who
*NL*
confirmed
his
theory
about
the
snipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
home
at
a
trot
,
so
as
to
have
time
to
eat
his
dinner
and
get
*NL*
his
gun
ready
for
the
evening
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
rode
up
to
the
house
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
,
Levin
heard
*NL*
the
bell
ring
at
the
side
of
the
principal
entrance
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
someone
from
the
railway
station
,
''
he
thought
,
``
just
the
*NL*
time
to
be
here
from
the
Moscow
train
...
Who
could
it
be
?
What
if
it
's
*NL*
brother
Nikolay
?
He
did
say
:
`
Maybe
I
'll
go
to
the
waters
,
or
maybe
I
'll
*NL*
come
down
to
you
.
'
''
He
felt
dismayed
and
vexed
for
the
first
minute
,
*NL*
that
his
brother
Nikolay
's
presence
should
come
to
disturb
his
happy
*NL*
mood
of
spring
.
But
he
felt
ashamed
of
the
feeling
,
and
at
once
he
*NL*
opened
,
as
it
were
,
the
arms
of
his
soul
,
and
with
a
softened
feeling
of
*NL*
joy
and
expectation
,
now
he
hoped
with
all
his
heart
that
it
was
his
*NL*
brother
.
He
pricked
up
his
horse
,
and
riding
out
from
behind
the
acacias
*NL*
he
saw
a
hired
three-horse
sledge
from
the
railway
station
,
and
a
*NL*
gentleman
in
a
fur
coat
.
It
was
not
his
brother
.
``
Oh
,
if
it
were
only
*NL*
some
nice
person
one
could
talk
to
a
little
!
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
cried
Levin
joyfully
,
flinging
up
both
his
hands
.
``
Here
's
a
*NL*
delightful
visitor
!
Ah
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
''
he
shouted
,
*NL*
recognizing
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
find
out
for
certain
whether
she
's
married
,
or
when
she
's
going
*NL*
to
be
married
,
''
he
thought
.
And
on
that
delicious
spring
day
he
felt
*NL*
that
the
thought
of
her
did
not
hurt
him
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
did
n't
expect
me
,
eh
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
getting
out
*NL*
of
the
sledge
,
splashed
with
mud
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
,
on
his
*NL*
cheek
,
and
on
his
eyebrows
,
but
radiant
with
health
and
good
spirits
.
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
see
you
in
the
first
place
,
''
he
said
,
embracing
and
*NL*
kissing
him
,
``
to
have
some
stand-shooting
second
,
and
to
sell
the
forest
*NL*
at
Ergushovo
third
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delightful
!
What
a
spring
we
're
having
!
How
ever
did
you
get
along
in
a
*NL*
sledge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
cart
it
would
have
been
worse
still
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
driver
,
who
knew
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
to
see
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
with
a
genuine
smile
*NL*
of
childlike
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
led
his
friend
to
the
room
set
apart
for
visitors
,
where
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
things
were
carried
also
--
a
bag
,
a
gun
in
a
case
,
a
*NL*
satchel
for
cigars
.
Leaving
him
there
to
wash
and
change
his
clothes
,
*NL*
Levin
went
off
to
the
counting
house
to
speak
about
the
ploughing
and
*NL*
clover
.
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
always
very
anxious
for
the
credit
of
the
*NL*
house
,
met
him
in
the
hall
with
inquiries
about
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
just
as
you
like
,
only
let
it
be
as
soon
as
possible
,
''
he
said
,
and
*NL*
went
to
the
bailiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
back
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
washed
and
combed
,
came
out
of
*NL*
his
room
with
a
beaming
smile
,
and
they
went
upstairs
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
I
managed
to
get
away
to
you
!
Now
I
shall
understand
*NL*
what
the
mysterious
business
is
that
you
are
always
absorbed
in
here
.
*NL*
No
,
really
,
I
envy
you
.
What
a
house
,
how
nice
it
all
is
!
So
bright
,
so
*NL*
cheerful
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
forgetting
that
it
was
not
always
*NL*
spring
and
fine
weather
like
that
day
.
``
And
your
nurse
is
simply
*NL*
charming
!
A
pretty
maid
in
an
apron
might
be
even
more
agreeable
,
*NL*
perhaps
;
but
for
your
severe
monastic
style
it
does
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
told
him
many
interesting
pieces
of
news
;
especially
*NL*
interesting
to
Levin
was
the
news
that
his
brother
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
*NL*
was
intending
to
pay
him
a
visit
in
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
one
word
did
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
say
in
reference
to
Kitty
and
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
;
he
merely
gave
him
greetings
from
his
wife
.
Levin
was
*NL*
grateful
to
him
for
his
delicacy
and
was
very
glad
of
his
visitor
.
As
*NL*
always
happened
with
him
during
his
solitude
,
a
mass
of
ideas
and
*NL*
feelings
had
been
accumulating
within
him
,
which
he
could
not
*NL*
communicate
to
those
about
him
.
And
now
he
poured
out
upon
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
his
poetic
joy
in
the
spring
,
and
his
failures
and
plans
*NL*
for
the
land
,
and
his
thoughts
and
criticisms
on
the
books
he
had
been
*NL*
reading
,
and
the
idea
of
his
own
book
,
the
basis
of
which
really
was
,
*NL*
though
he
was
unaware
of
it
himself
,
a
criticism
of
all
the
old
books
on
*NL*
agriculture
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
always
charming
,
understanding
*NL*
everything
at
the
slightest
reference
,
was
particularly
charming
on
this
*NL*
visit
,
and
Levin
noticed
in
him
a
special
tenderness
,
as
it
were
,
and
a
*NL*
new
tone
of
respect
that
flattered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
efforts
of
Agafea
Mihalovna
and
the
cook
,
that
the
dinner
should
be
*NL*
particularly
good
,
only
ended
in
the
two
famished
friends
attacking
the
*NL*
preliminary
course
,
eating
a
great
deal
of
bread
and
butter
,
salt
goose
*NL*
and
salted
mushrooms
,
and
in
Levin
's
finally
ordering
the
soup
to
be
*NL*
served
without
the
accompaniment
of
little
pies
,
with
which
the
cook
had
*NL*
particularly
meant
to
impress
their
visitor
.
But
though
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
accustomed
to
very
different
dinners
,
he
thought
*NL*
everything
excellent
:
the
herb
brandy
,
and
the
bread
,
and
the
butter
,
*NL*
and
above
all
the
salt
goose
and
the
mushrooms
,
and
the
nettle
soup
,
and
*NL*
the
chicken
in
white
sauce
,
and
the
white
Crimean
wine
--
everything
was
*NL*
superb
and
delicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
,
splendid
!
''
he
said
,
lighting
a
fat
cigar
after
the
roast
.
``
I
*NL*
feel
as
if
,
coming
to
you
,
I
had
landed
on
a
peaceful
shore
after
the
*NL*
noise
and
jolting
of
a
steamer
.
And
so
you
maintain
that
the
laborer
*NL*
himself
is
an
element
to
be
studied
and
to
regulate
the
choice
of
*NL*
methods
in
agriculture
.
Of
course
,
I
'm
an
ignorant
outsider
;
but
I
*NL*
should
fancy
theory
and
its
application
will
have
its
influence
on
the
*NL*
laborer
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
wait
a
bit
.
I
'm
not
talking
of
political
economy
,
I
'm
talking
*NL*
of
the
science
of
agriculture
.
It
ought
to
be
like
the
natural
sciences
,
*NL*
and
to
observe
given
phenomena
and
the
laborer
in
his
economic
,
*NL*
ethnographical
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Agafea
Mihalovna
came
in
with
jam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
kissing
the
tips
of
*NL*
his
plump
fingers
,
``
what
salt
goose
,
what
herb
brandy
!
...
What
do
you
*NL*
think
,
is
n't
it
time
to
start
,
Kostya
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
bare
*NL*
tree-tops
of
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
time
,
''
he
said
.
``
Kouzma
,
get
ready
the
trap
,
''
and
he
ran
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
going
down
,
carefully
took
the
canvas
cover
off
his
*NL*
varnished
gun
case
with
his
own
hands
,
and
opening
it
,
began
to
get
*NL*
ready
his
expensive
new-fashioned
gun
.
Kouzma
,
who
already
scented
a
big
*NL*
tip
,
never
left
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
side
,
and
put
on
him
both
his
*NL*
stockings
and
boots
,
a
task
which
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
readily
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
,
give
orders
that
if
the
merchant
Ryabinin
comes
...
I
told
him
*NL*
to
come
today
,
he
's
to
be
brought
in
and
to
wait
for
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
mean
to
say
you
're
selling
the
forest
to
Ryabinin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Do
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
I
do

I
have
had
to
do
business
with
him

positively

conclusively

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
laughed
.
``
Positively
and
conclusively
''
were
the
*NL*
merchant
's
favorite
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
wonderfully
funny
the
way
he
talks

She
knows
where

*NL*
master
's
going

''
he
added
,
patting
Laska
,
who
hung
about
Levin
,
whining
*NL*
and
licking
his
hands
,
his
boots
,
and
his
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trap
was
already
at
the
steps
when
they
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
them
to
bring
the
trap
round
;
or
would
you
rather
walk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
'd
better
drive
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
getting
into
the
*NL*
trap
.
He
sat
down
,
tucked
the
tiger-skin
rug
round
him
,
and
lighted
a
*NL*
cigar
.
``
How
is
it
you
do
n't
smoke
?
A
cigar
is
a
sort
of
thing
,
not
*NL*
exactly
a
pleasure
,
but
the
crown
and
outward
sign
of
pleasure
.
Come
,
*NL*
this
is
life
!
How
splendid
it
is
!
This
is
how
I
should
like
to
live
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
prevents
you
?
''
said
Levin
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
're
a
lucky
man
!
You
've
got
everything
you

and
you
have
them

you

it

you
have
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
because
I
rejoice
in
what
I
have

do
n't
fret
for
what
I

Levin
,
thinking
of
Kitty

*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
comprehended
,
looked
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
grateful
to
Oblonsky
for
noticing
,
with
his
never-failing
*NL*
tact
,
that
he
dreaded
conversation
about
the
Shtcherbatskys
,
and
so
*NL*
saying
nothing
about
them
.
But
now
Levin
was
longing
to
find
out
what
*NL*
was
tormenting
him
so
,
yet
he
had
not
the
courage
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
how
things
are
going
with
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
bethinking
*NL*
himself
that
it
was
not
nice
of
him
to
think
only
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
eyes
sparkled
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
admit
,
I
know
,
that
one
can
be
fond
of
new
rolls
when
one
has
*NL*
had
one
's
rations
of
bread
--
to
your
mind
it
's
a
crime
;
but
I
do
n't
count
*NL*
life
as
life
without
love
,
''
he
said
,
taking
Levin
's
question
his
own
*NL*
way
.
``
What
am
I
to
do
?
I
'm
made
that
way
.
And
really
,
one
does
so
little
*NL*
harm
to
anyone
,
and
gives
oneself
so
much
pleasure
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
there
something
new
,
then
?
''
queried
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
,
there
is
!
There
,
do
you
see
,
you
know
the
type
of
Ossian
's
*NL*
women
...
Women
,
such
as
one
sees
in
dreams
...
Well
,
these
women
are
*NL*
sometimes
to
be
met
in
reality
...
and
these
women
are
terrible
.
Woman
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
know
,
is
such
a
subject
that
however
much
you
study
it
,
it
's
*NL*
always
perfectly
new
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
it
would
be
better
not
to
study
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Some
mathematician
has
said
that
enjoyment
lies
in
the
search
for
*NL*
truth
,
not
in
the
finding
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
listened
in
silence
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
he
made
,
he
*NL*
could
not
in
the
least
enter
into
the
feelings
of
his
friend
and
*NL*
understand
his
sentiments
and
the
charm
of
studying
such
women

The
place
fixed
on
for
the
stand-shooting
was
not
far
above
a
stream
in
*NL*
a
little
aspen
copse
.
On
reaching
the
copse
,
Levin
got
out
of
the
trap
*NL*
and
led
Oblonsky
to
a
corner
of
a
mossy
,
swampy
glade
,
already
quite
*NL*
free
from
snow
.
He
went
back
himself
to
a
double
birch
tree
on
the
other
*NL*
side
,
and
leaning
his
gun
on
the
fork
of
a
dead
lower
branch
,
he
took
*NL*
off
his
full
overcoat
,
fastened
his
belt
again
,
and
worked
his
arms
to
*NL*
see
if
they
were
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gray
old
Laska
,
who
had
followed
them
,
sat
down
warily
opposite
him
and
*NL*
pricked
up
her
ears
.
The
sun
was
setting
behind
a
thick
forest
,
and
in
*NL*
the
glow
of
sunset
the
birch
trees
,
dotted
about
in
the
aspen
copse
,
*NL*
stood
out
clearly
with
their
hanging
twigs
,
and
their
buds
swollen
*NL*
almost
to
bursting
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
thickest
parts
of
the
copse
,
where
the
snow
still
remained
,
*NL*
came
the
faint
sound
of
narrow
winding
threads
of
water
running
away
.
*NL*
Tiny
birds
twittered
,
and
now
and
then
fluttered
from
tree
to
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
pauses
of
complete
stillness
there
came
the
rustle
of
last
year
's
*NL*
leaves
,
stirred
by
the
thawing
of
the
earth
and
the
growth
of
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
!
One
can
hear
and
see
the
grass
growing
!
''
Levin
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
noticing
a
wet
,
slate-colored
aspen
leaf
moving
beside
a
blade
*NL*
of
young
grass
.
He
stood
,
listened
,
and
gazed
sometimes
down
at
the
wet
*NL*
mossy
ground
,
sometimes
at
Laska
listening
all
alert
,
sometimes
at
the
*NL*
sea
of
bare
tree
tops
that
stretched
on
the
slope
below
him
,
sometimes
*NL*
at
the
darkening
sky
,
covered
with
white
streaks
of
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hawk
flew
high
over
a
forest
far
away
with
slow
sweep
of
its
wings
;
*NL*
another
flew
with
exactly
the
same
motion
in
the
same
direction
and
*NL*
vanished
.
The
birds
twittered
more
and
more
loudly
and
busily
in
the
*NL*
thicket
.
An
owl
hooted
not
far
off
,
and
Laska
,
starting
,
stepped
*NL*
cautiously
a
few
steps
forward
,
and
putting
her
head
on
one
side
,
began
*NL*
to
listen
intently
.
Beyond
the
stream
was
heard
the
cuckoo
.
Twice
she
*NL*
uttered
her
usual
cuckoo
call
,
and
then
gave
a
hoarse
,
hurried
call
and
*NL*
broke
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
!
the
cuckoo
already
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
coming
out
from
*NL*
behind
a
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
hear
it
,
''
answered
Levin
,
reluctantly
breaking
the
stillness
*NL*
with
his
voice
,
which
sounded
disagreeable
to
himself
.
``
Now
it
's
*NL*
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
figure
again
went
behind
the
bush
,
and
Levin
saw
*NL*
nothing
but
the
bright
flash
of
a
match
,
followed
by
the
red
glow
and
*NL*
blue
smoke
of
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tchk
!
tchk
!
''
came
the
snapping
sound
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
cocking
his
*NL*
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
cry
?
''
asked
Oblonsky
,
drawing
Levin
's
attention
to
a
*NL*
prolonged
cry
,
as
though
a
colt
were
whinnying
in
a
high
voice
,
in
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
you
know
it
?
That
's
the
hare
.
But
enough
talking
!
Listen
,
*NL*
it
's
flying
!
''
almost
shrieked
Levin
,
cocking
his
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
a
shrill
whistle
in
the
distance
,
and
in
the
exact
time
,
so
*NL*
well
known
to
the
sportsman
,
two
seconds
later
--
another
,
a
third
,
and
*NL*
after
the
third
whistle
the
hoarse
,
guttural
cry
could
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
about
him
to
right
and
to
left
,
and
there
,
just
facing
him
*NL*
against
the
dusky
blue
sky
above
the
confused
mass
of
tender
shoots
of
*NL*
the
aspens
,
he
saw
the
flying
bird
.
It
was
flying
straight
towards
him
;
*NL*
the
guttural
cry
,
like
the
even
tearing
of
some
strong
stuff
,
sounded
*NL*
close
to
his
ear
;
the
long
beak
and
neck
of
the
bird
could
be
seen
,
and
*NL*
at
the
very
instant
when
Levin
was
taking
aim
,
behind
the
bush
where
*NL*
Oblonsky
stood
,
there
was
a
flash
of
red
lightning
:
the
bird
dropped
*NL*
like
an
arrow
,
and
darted
upwards
again
.
Again
came
the
red
flash
and
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
blow
,
and
fluttering
its
wings
as
though
trying
to
keep
*NL*
up
in
the
air
,
the
bird
halted
,
stopped
still
an
instant
,
and
fell
with
*NL*
a
heavy
splash
on
the
slushy
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
have
missed
it
?
''
shouted
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
could
not
see
*NL*
for
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
!
''
said
Levin
,
pointing
to
Laska
,
who
with
one
ear
raised
,
*NL*
wagging
the
end
of
her
shaggy
tail
,
came
slowly
back
as
though
she
would
*NL*
prolong
the
pleasure
,
and
as
it
were
smiling
,
brought
the
dead
bird
to
*NL*
her
master
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
you
were
successful
,
''
said
Levin
,
who
,
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
had
a
sense
of
envy
that
he
had
not
succeeded
in
shooting
*NL*
the
snipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
bad
shot
from
the
right
barrel
,
''
responded
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
loading
his
gun
.
``
Sh
...
it
's
flying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shrill
whistles
rapidly
following
one
another
were
heard
again
.
Two
*NL*
snipe
,
playing
and
chasing
one
another
,
and
only
whistling
,
not
crying
,
*NL*
flew
straight
at
the
very
heads
of
the
sportsmen
.
There
was
the
report
*NL*
of
four
shots
,
and
like
swallows
the
snipe
turned
swift
somersaults
in
*NL*
the
air
and
vanished
from
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stand-shooting
was
capital
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
shot
two
more
birds
*NL*
and
Levin
two
,
of
which
one
was
not
found
.
It
began
to
get
dark
.
Venus
,
*NL*
bright
and
silvery
,
shone
with
her
soft
light
low
down
in
the
west
*NL*
behind
the
birch
trees
,
and
high
up
in
the
east
twinkled
the
red
lights
*NL*
of
Arcturus
.
Over
his
head
Levin
made
out
the
stars
of
the
Great
Bear
*NL*
and
lost
them
again
.
The
snipe
had
ceased
flying
;
but
Levin
resolved
to
*NL*
stay
a
little
longer
,
till
Venus
,
which
he
saw
below
a
branch
of
birch
,
*NL*
should
be
above
it
,
and
the
stars
of
the
Great
Bear
should
be
perfectly
*NL*
plain
.
Venus
had
risen
above
the
branch
,
and
the
ear
of
the
Great
Bear
*NL*
with
its
shaft
was
now
all
plainly
visible
against
the
dark
blue
sky
,
*NL*
yet
still
he
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
time
to
go
home
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
still
now
in
the
copse
,
and
not
a
bird
was
stirring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
stay
a
little
while
,
''
answered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
standing
now
about
fifteen
paces
from
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
!
''
said
Levin
unexpectedly
;
``
how
is
it
you
do
n't
tell
me
whether
*NL*
your
sister-in-law
's
married
yet
,
or
when
she
's
going
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
so
resolute
and
serene
that
no
answer
,
he
fancied
,
could
*NL*
affect
him
.
But
he
had
never
dreamed
of
what
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
never
thought
of
being
married
,
and
is
n't
thinking
of
it
;
but
*NL*
she
's
very
ill
,
and
the
doctors
have
sent
her
abroad
.
They
're
positively
*NL*
afraid
she
may
not
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Levin
.
``
Very
ill
?
What
is
wrong
with
her
?
How
has
she
...
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
saying
this
,
Laska
,
with
ears
pricked
up
,
was
looking
*NL*
upwards
at
the
sky
,
and
reproachfully
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
chosen
a
time
to
talk
,
''
she
was
thinking
.
``
It
's
on
the
*NL*
wing
...
Here
it
is
,
yes
,
it
is
.
They
'll
miss
it
,
''
thought
Laska
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
very
instant
both
suddenly
heard
a
shrill
whistle
which
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
smote
on
their
ears
,
and
both
suddenly
seized
their
guns
and
*NL*
two
flashes
gleamed
,
and
two
bangs
sounded
at
the
very
same
instant
.
The
*NL*
snipe
flying
high
above
instantly
folded
its
wings
and
fell
into
a
*NL*
thicket
,
bending
down
the
delicate
shoots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
Together
!
''
cried
Levin
,
and
he
ran
with
Laska
into
the
*NL*
thicket
to
look
for
the
snipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
what
was
it
that
was
unpleasant
?
''
he
wondered
.
``
Yes
,
Kitty
's
*NL*
ill
...
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
;
I
'm
very
sorry
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
found
it
!
Is
n't
she
a
clever
thing
?
''
he
said
,
taking
the
warm
*NL*
bird
from
Laska
's
mouth
and
packing
it
into
the
almost
full
game
bag
.
*NL*
``
I
've
got
it
,
Stiva
!

he
shouted
.

Chapter
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
Levin
asked
all
details
of
Kitty
's
illness
and
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
plans
,
and
though
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
admit
*NL*
it
,
he
was
pleased
at
what
he
heard
.
He
was
pleased
that
there
was
still
*NL*
hope
,
and
still
more
pleased
that
she
should
be
suffering
who
had
made
*NL*
him
suffer
so
much
.
But
when
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
began
to
speak
of
the
*NL*
causes
of
Kitty
's
illness
,
and
mentioned
Vronsky
's
name
,
Levin
cut
him
*NL*
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
right
whatever
to
know
family
matters
,
and
,
to
tell
the
*NL*
truth
,
no
interest
in
them
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
hardly
perceptibly
,
catching
the
*NL*
instantaneous
change
he
knew
so
well
in
Levin
's
face
,
which
had
become
*NL*
as
gloomy
as
it
had
been
bright
a
minute
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
quite
settled
about
the
forest
with
Ryabinin
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
settled
.
The
price
is
magnificent
;
thirty-eight
thousand
.
*NL*
Eight
straight
away
,
and
the
rest
in
six
years
.
I
've
been
bothering
*NL*
about
it
for
ever
so
long
.
No
one
would
give
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
've
as
good
as
given
away
your
forest
for
nothing
,
''
said
Levin
*NL*
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
for
nothing
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
a
*NL*
good-humored
smile
,
knowing
that
nothing
would
be
right
in
Levin
's
eyes
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
forest
is
worth
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
the
*NL*
acre
,
''
answered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
these
farmers
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
playfully
.
``
Your
tone
of
*NL*
contempt
for
us
poor
townsfolk
!
...
But
when
it
comes
to
business
,
we
do
*NL*
it
better
than
anyone
.
I
assure
you
I
have
reckoned
it
all
out
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
and
the
forest
is
fetching
a
very
good
price

so
much
so
that
I

afraid

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
hoping
by
this
distinction
to
*NL*
convince
Levin
completely
of
the
unfairness
of
his
doubts
.
``
And
it
wo
n't
*NL*
run
to
more
than
twenty-five
yards
of
fagots

giving

me
at
the
rate
of
seventy
roubles
the
acre

*NL*
*NL*
Levin
smiled
contemptuously
.
``

he
thought
,
``
that

in

pick
up
two

three
phrases

use
them

out

about

He
says
those
words
without
*NL*
understanding
them
himself
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
attempt
to
teach
you
what
you
write
about
in

*NL*
said
he
,
``
and
if
need
arose

I
should
come
to
you

ask
about
it

But
*NL*
you
're
so
positive
you
know
all
the
lore
of
the
forest

It
's
difficult
.
*NL*
Have
you
counted
the
trees
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
count
the
trees
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
laughing
,
still
trying
*NL*
to
draw
his
friend
out
of
his
ill-temper
.
``
Count
the
sands
of
the
sea

Some

might
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well

the

Ryabinin

doing

I

I
go

's

fifty
roubles

*NL*
``
Come

do

Stepan

Arkadyevitch
piteously
.
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

gave

ten

fifteen

holds

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the

''
said
Levin
gloomily
,
as
they
drove
up
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
steps
there
stood
a
trap
tightly
covered
with
iron
and
leather
,
*NL*
with
a
sleek
horse
tightly
harnessed
with
broad
collar-straps
.
In
the
*NL*
trap
sat
the
chubby
,
tightly
belted
clerk
who
served
Ryabinin
as
*NL*
coachman
.
Ryabinin
himself
was
already
in
the
house
,
and
met
the
friends
*NL*
in
the
hall
.
Ryabinin
was
a
tall
,
thinnish
,
middle-aged
man
,
with
*NL*
mustache
and
a
projecting
clean-shaven
chin
,
and
prominent
muddy-looking
*NL*
eyes
.
He
was
dressed
in
a
long-skirted
blue
coat
,
with
buttons
below
the
*NL*
waist
at
the
back
,
and
wore
high
boots
wrinkled
over
the
ankles
and
*NL*
straight
over
the
calf
,
with
big
galoshes
drawn
over
them
.
He
rubbed
his
*NL*
face
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
wrapping
round
him
his
coat
,
which
sat
*NL*
extremely
well
as
it
was
,
he
greeted
them
with
a
smile
,
holding
out
his
*NL*
hand
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
though
he
wanted
to
catch
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
here
you
are
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
giving
him
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
venture
to
disregard
your
excellency
's
commands
,
though
the
*NL*
road
was
extremely
bad

I
positively
walked
the
whole
way
,
but
I
am
here
*NL*
at
my
time

Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
my
respects

;
he
turned
to
Levin
,
*NL*
trying
to
seize
his
hand
too
.
But
Levin
,
scowling
,
made
as
though
he
did
*NL*
not
notice
his
hand
,
and
took
out
the
snipe
.
``
Your
honors
have
been
*NL*
diverting
yourselves
with
the
chase
?
What
kind
of
bird
may
it
be
,
pray
?
''
*NL*
added
Ryabinin
,
looking
contemptuously
at
the
snipe
:
``
a
great
delicacy
,
*NL*
I
suppose
.
''
And
he
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
,
as
though
he
had
grave
*NL*
doubts
whether
this
game
were
worth
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
go
into
my
study
?
''
Levin
said
in
French
to
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
scowling
morosely
.
``
Go
into
my
study
;
you
can
talk
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
where
you
please
,
''
said
Ryabinin
with
contemptuous
dignity
,
*NL*
as
though
wishing
to
make
it
felt
that
others
might
be
in
difficulties
*NL*
as
to
how
to
behave
,
but
that
he
could
never
be
in
any
difficulty
about
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
study
Ryabinin
looked
about
,
as
his
habit
was
,
as
though
*NL*
seeking
the
holy
picture
,
but
when
he
had
found
it
,
he
did
not
cross
*NL*
himself
.
He
scanned
the
bookcases
and
bookshelves
,
and
with
the
same
*NL*
dubious
air
with
which
he
had
regarded
the
snipe
,
he
smiled
*NL*
contemptuously
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
,
as
though
by
no
means
*NL*
willing
to
allow
that
this
game
were
worth
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
brought
the
money
?
''
asked
Oblonsky
.
``
Sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

over

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

But
do
sit
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
if
I
do

''
said
Ryabinin
,
sitting
down
and
leaning
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
back
of
his
chair
in
a
position
of
the
intensest
*NL*
discomfort
to
himself
.
``
You
must
knock
it
down
a
bit

prince

It
would
*NL*
be

The

conclusively
to

As

paying
the

down

there
'll
be
no

there

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
who
had
meanwhile
been
putting
his
gun
away
in
the
cupboard
,
was
*NL*
just
going
out
of
the
door
,
but
catching
the
merchant
's
words
,
he
*NL*
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
've
got
the
forest
for
nothing

it
is

he
said
.
``
He
came
to
*NL*
me
too
late
,
or
I
'd
have
fixed
the
price
for
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
Ryabinin
got
up
,
and
in
silence
,
with
a
smile
,
he
looked
Levin
down
and
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
close
about

Konstantin
Dmitrievitch

he
said
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
turning
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
;
``
there
's
positively
no
dealing
*NL*
with

I
was
bargaining
for
some
wheat
of
him

pretty
price
I
*NL*
offered
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
give
you
my
goods

I
did

pick
it
up
on

ground
,
nor
steal
it
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
nowadays
there
's
no
chance
at

With
the
*NL*
open

everything
done
in
style
,
nowadays
there
's
no
question
*NL*
of
stealing

We
are
just
talking
things
over

gentlemen

His

excellency
's
asking
too
much
for
the
forest

I
ca
n't
make
both
ends
meet

over
it

I
must
ask
for
a
little
concession

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
the
thing
settled
between

If

said
Levin
,
``
I
'll
buy
the
forest

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
vanished
at
once
from
Ryabinin
's
face
.
A
hawklike
,
greedy
,
*NL*
cruel
expression
was
left
upon
it
.
With
rapid
,
bony
fingers
he
*NL*
unbuttoned
his
coat
,
revealing
a
shirt
,
bronze
waistcoat
buttons
,
and
a
*NL*
watch
chain
,
and
quickly
pulled
out
a
fat
old
pocketbook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,

forest
is
mine

''
he
said
,
crossing
himself
quickly
,
*NL*
and
holding
out
his
hand
.
``
Take
the
money

's
my

Ryabinin

way
of

does
n't
haggle
over
every
*NL*
half-penny

he
added
,
scowling
and
waving
the
pocketbook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
be
in
a

Levin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

Oblonsky
in

*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
out
of
the
room
,
slamming
the
door
.
Ryabinin
looked
towards
*NL*
the
door
and
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
youthfulness

Within
an
hour
the
merchant
,
stroking
his
big
overcoat
neatly
down
,
and
*NL*
hooking
up
his
jacket
,
with
the
agreement
in
his
pocket
,
seated
himself

in
his
tightly
covered

drove
homewards

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
upstairs
with
his
pocket
bulging
with
notes
,
*NL*
which
the
merchant
had
paid
him
for
three
months
in
advance
.
The
*NL*
business
of
the
forest
was
over
,
the
money
in
his
pocket
;
their
shooting
*NL*
had
been
excellent
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
in
the
happiest
frame
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
so
he
felt
specially
anxious
to
dissipate
the
ill-humor
that
*NL*
had
come
upon
Levin
.
He
wanted
to
finish
the
day
at
supper
as
pleasantly
*NL*
as
it
had
been
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
certainly
was
out
of
humor
,
and
in
spite
of
all
his
desire
to
be
*NL*
affectionate
and
cordial
to
his
charming
visitor
,
he
could
not
control
*NL*
his
mood
.
The
intoxication
of
the
news
that
Kitty
was
not
married
had
*NL*
gradually
begun
to
work
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
not
married
,
but
ill
,
and
ill
from
love
for
a
man
who
had
*NL*
slighted
her
.
This
slight
,
as
it
were
,
rebounded
upon
him
.
Vronsky
had
*NL*
slighted
her
,
and
she
had
slighted
him
,
Levin
.
Consequently
Vronsky
had
*NL*
the
right
to
despise
Levin
,
and
therefore
he
was
his
enemy
.
But
all
this
*NL*
Levin
did
not
think
out
.
He
vaguely
felt
that
there
was
something
in
it
*NL*
insulting
to
him
,
and
he
was
not
angry
now
at
what
had
disturbed
him
,
*NL*
but
he
fell
foul
of
everything
that
presented
itself
.
The
stupid
sale
of
*NL*
the
forest
,
the
fraud
practiced
upon
Oblonsky
and
concluded
in
his
*NL*
house
,
exasperated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
finished
?
''
he
said
,
meeting
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
upstairs
.
``
Would
*NL*
you
like
supper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
n't
say
no
to
it
.
What
an
appetite
I
get
in
the
country
!
*NL*
Wonderful
!
Why
did
n't
you
offer
Ryabinin
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
how
you
do
treat
him
!
''
said
Oblonsky
.
``
You
did
n't
even
shake
*NL*
hands
with
him
.
Why
not
shake
hands
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
shake
hands
with
a
waiter
,
and
a
waiter
's
a
hundred
*NL*
times
better
than
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
reactionist
you
are
,
really
!
What
about
the
amalgamation
of
*NL*
classes
?
''
said
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyone
who
likes
amalgamating
is
welcome
to
it
,
but
it
sickens
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
regular
reactionist
,
I
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
have
never
considered
what
I
am

I
am
Konstantin
Levin

and
*NL*
nothing
else

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Konstantin
Levin
very
much
out
of
temper

said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
out
of
temper

and
do
you
know
why

Because

excuse
me

your
stupid
sale

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
frowned
good-humoredly
,
like
one
who
feels
himself
*NL*
teased
and
attacked
for
no
fault
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

enough
about
it

he
said
.
``
When
did
anybody
ever
sell
anything

told

after

wants
to
sell
,
no
one
will
give
anything
...
No
,
I
see
*NL*
you
've
a
grudge
against
that
unlucky
Ryabinin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
have
.
And
do
you
know
why
?
You
'll
say
again
that
I
'm
a
*NL*
reactionist
,
or
some
other
terrible
word
;
but
all
the
same
it
does
annoy
*NL*
and
anger
me
to
see
on
all
sides
the
impoverishing
of
the
nobility
to
*NL*
which
I
belong
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
amalgamation
of
classes
,
I
'm
glad
*NL*
to
belong
.
And
their
impoverishment
is
not
due
to
extravagance
--
that
*NL*
would
be
nothing
;
living
in
good
style
--
that
's
the
proper
thing
for
*NL*
noblemen
;
it
's
only
the
nobles
who
know
how
to
do
it
.
Now
the
peasants
*NL*
about
us
buy
land
,
and
I
do
n't
mind
that
.
The
gentleman
does
nothing
,
*NL*
while
the
peasant
works
and
supplants
the
idle
man
.
That
's
as
it
ought
*NL*
to
be
.
And
I
'm
very
glad
for
the
peasant
.
But
I
do
mind
seeing
the
*NL*
process
of
impoverishment
from
a
sort
of
--
I
do
n't
know
what
to
call
*NL*
it
--
innocence
.
Here
a
Polish
speculator
bought
for
half
its
value
a
*NL*
magnificent
estate
from
a
young
lady
who
lives
in
Nice
.
And
there
a
*NL*
merchant
will
get
three
acres
of
land
,
worth
ten
roubles
,
as
security
*NL*
for
the
loan
of
one
rouble
.
Here
,
for
no
kind
of
reason
,
you
've
made
*NL*
that
rascal
a
present
of
thirty
thousand
roubles
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
should
I
have
done
?
Counted
every
tree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
they
must
be
counted

You
did
n't
count
them

but
Ryabinin
*NL*
did

Ryabinin
's
children
will
have

of
livelihood
and

yours
maybe
will
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you

there

business

they
have
theirs

they
must
make

Anyway

the
thing
's
done

and
there
's
an
end
of
it

And
here
*NL*
come
some
poached
eggs

my
favorite

And
Agafea
Mihalovna
will
give
*NL*
us
that
marvelous
herb-brandy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
joking
with
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
assuring
her
that
it
was
long
since
he
had
tasted
such
a
*NL*
dinner
and
such
a
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
praise
it
,
anyway

''
said
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
``
but
Konstantin
*NL*
Dmitrievitch

give
him
what
you

it

*NL*
Though
Levin
tried
to
control
himself
,
he
was
gloomy
and
silent
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
put
one
question
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
bring
himself
to
the
point
,
and
could
not
find
the
words
or
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
to
put
it
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
gone
down
to
his
room
,
*NL*
undressed
,
again
washed
,
and
attired
in
a
nightshirt
with
goffered
*NL*
frills
,
he
had
got
into
bed
,
but
Levin
still
lingered
in
his
room
,
*NL*
talking
of
various
trifling
matters
,
and
not
daring
to
ask
what
he
*NL*
wanted
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
wonderfully
they
make
this
soap

''
he
said
gazing
at
a
piece
of
soap
*NL*
he
was
handling
,
which
Agafea
Mihalovna
had
put
ready
for
the
visitor
*NL*
but
Oblonsky
had
not
used
.
``
Only
look

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
everything
's
brought
to
such
a
pitch

said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
a
moist
and
blissful
yawn
.
``
The
theater

he
yawned

*NL*

Levin

``

Oh

he
asked
suddenly
,
laying
down
the
soap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vronsky

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
checking
his
yawn
;
``
he
's
in

left

he
went
on
,
*NL*
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
propping
on
his
hand
his
handsome
*NL*
ruddy
face

in

his
moist

good-natured

sleepy
eyes
shone
like

stars

He
*NL*
yawned
inwardly

without
opening

*NL*
``
Does

Levin
wondered

*NL*
gazing
at
him
.
``
Yes

there
's
something
humbugging

diplomatic
in
his

and
feeling
he
was
blushing
,
he
looked
Stepan

*NL*
straight
in
the
face
without
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there

anything
on

it
was
nothing

a

superficial
attraction

pursued
Oblonsky
.
``
His
being
such
a
perfect
*NL*
aristocrat

do
n't
you
know

and
his
future
position

had
an
*NL*
influence
not
with
her
,
but
with
her
mother

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
scowled
.
The
humiliation
of
his
rejection
stung
him
to
the
heart
,
*NL*
as
though
it
were
a
fresh
wound
he
had
only
just
received
.
But
he
was
at
*NL*
home
,
and
the
walls
of
home
are
a
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
stay
,
''
he
began
,
interrupting
Oblonsky
.
``
You
talk
of
his
being
an
*NL*
aristocrat

But
allow
me
to
ask
what
it
consists
in
,
that
aristocracy
of
*NL*
Vronsky
or
of
anybody
else
,
beside
which
I
can
be
looked
down
upon
?
You
*NL*
consider
Vronsky
an
aristocrat
,
but
I
do
n't
.
A
man
whose
father
crawled
*NL*
up
from
nothing
at
all
by
intrigue
,
and
whose
mother
--
God
knows
whom
she
*NL*
was
n't
mixed
up
with
...
No
,
excuse
me
,
but
I
consider
myself
*NL*
aristocratic
,
and
people
like
me
,
who
can
point
back
in
the
past
to
*NL*
three
or
four
honorable
generations
of
their
family
,
of
the
highest
*NL*
degree
of
breeding
-LRB-
talent
and
intellect
,
of
course
that
's
another
*NL*
matter
-RRB-
,
and
have
never
curried
favor
with
anyone
,
never
depended
on
*NL*
anyone
for
anything
,
like
my
father

my
grandfather

And
I
know
many
*NL*
such
.
You
think
it
mean
of
me
to
count
the
trees
in
my
forest
,
while
you
*NL*
make
Ryabinin
a
present
of
thirty
thousand
;
but
you
get
rents
from
your
*NL*
lands
and
I
do
n't
know
what
,
while
I
do
n't
and
so
I
prize
what
's
come
to
*NL*
me
from
my
ancestors
or
been
won
by
hard
work
...
We
are
aristocrats
,
*NL*
and
not
those
who
can
only
exist
by
favor
of
the
powerful
of
this
world
,
*NL*
and
who
can
be
bought
for
twopence
halfpenny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
whom
are
you
attacking
?
I
agree
with
you
,
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
sincerely
and
genially
;
though
he
was
aware
that
in
the
*NL*
class
of
those
who
could
be
bought
for
twopence
halfpenny
Levin
was
*NL*
reckoning
him
too
.
Levin
's
warmth
gave
him
genuine
pleasure
.
``
Whom
are
*NL*
you
attacking
?
Though
a
good
deal
is
not
true
that
you
say
about

Vronsky
,
but
I
wo
n't
talk
about
that

I
tell
you
straight
out

if
I
were
*NL*
you

I
should
go
back
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
do
n't
know
whether

I
do
n't
care

I
*NL*
tell
you
--
I
did
make
an
offer
and
was
rejected

and
Katerina
*NL*
Alexandrovna
is
nothing

me

a
painful
and
humiliating

reminiscence

*NL*
*NL*
``

Please

*NL*
said
Levin
.
Now
that
he
had
opened
his
heart
,
he
became
as
he
had
been
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
``
You
're
not
angry

Stiva

Please
do
n't

angry

he
said
,
and
smiling

he
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

not

not
a

no

glad

openly

And
do
you
know
,
stand-shooting
in
the
morning
is
unusually
*NL*
good

why
not
go

I
could
n't

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Although
all
Vronsky
's
inner
life
was
absorbed
in
his
passion
,
his
*NL*
external
life
unalterably
and
inevitably
followed
along
the
old
*NL*
accustomed
lines
of
his
social
and
regimental
ties
and
interests
.
The
*NL*
interests
of
his
regiment
took
an
important
place
in
Vronsky
's
life
,
*NL*
both
because
he
was
fond
of
the
regiment
,
and
because
the
regiment
was
*NL*
fond
of
him
.
They
were
not
only
fond
of
Vronsky
in
his
regiment
,
they
*NL*
respected
him
too
,
and
were
proud
of
him
;
proud
that
this
man
,
with
his
*NL*
immense
wealth
,
his
brilliant
education
and
abilities
,
and
the
path
open
*NL*
before
him
to
every
kind
of
success
,
distinction
,
and
ambition
,
had
*NL*
disregarded
all
that
,
and
of
all
the
interests
of
life
had
the
interests
*NL*
of
his
regiment
and
his
comrades
nearest
to
his
heart
.
Vronsky
was
aware
*NL*
of
his
comrades
'
view
of
him
,
and
in
addition
to
his
liking
for
the
*NL*
life
,
he
felt
bound
to
keep
up
that
reputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
need
not
be
said
that
he
did
not
speak
of
his
love
to
any
of
his
*NL*
comrades
,
nor
did
he
betray
his
secret
even
in
the
wildest
drinking
*NL*
bouts
-LRB-
though
indeed
he
was
never
so
drunk
as
to
lose
all
control
of
*NL*
himself
-RRB-
.
And
he
shut
up
any
of
his
thoughtless
comrades
who
attempted
*NL*
to
allude
to
his
connection
.
But
in
spite
of
that
,
his
love
was
known
to
*NL*
all
the
town
;
everyone
guessed
with
more
or
less
confidence
at
his
*NL*
relations
with
Madame
Karenina
.
The
majority
of
the
younger
men
envied
*NL*
him
for
just
what
was
the
most
irksome
factor
in
his
love
--
the
exalted
*NL*
position
of
Karenin
,
and
the
consequent
publicity
of
their
connection
in
*NL*
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
number
of
the
young
women
,
who
envied
Anna
and
had
long
been
*NL*
weary
of
hearing
her
called
_
virtuous
_
,
rejoiced
at
the
fulfillment
of
*NL*
their
predictions
,
and
were
only
waiting
for
a
decisive
turn
in
public
*NL*
opinion
to
fall
upon
her
with
all
the
weight
of
their
scorn
.
They
were
*NL*
already
making
ready
their
handfuls
of
mud
to
fling
at
her
when
the
*NL*
right
moment
arrived
.
The
greater
number
of
the
middle-aged
people
and
*NL*
certain
great
personages
were
displeased
at
the
prospect
of
the
*NL*
impending
scandal
in
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
mother
,
on
hearing
of
his
connection
,
was
at
first
pleased
at
*NL*
it
,
because
nothing
to
her
mind
gave
such
a
finishing
touch
to
a
*NL*
brilliant
young
man
as
a
_
liaison
_
in
the
highest
society
;
she
was
*NL*
pleased
,
too
,
that
Madame
Karenina
,
who
had
so
taken
her
fancy
,
and
had
*NL*
talked
so
much
of
her
son
,
was
,
after
all
,
just
like
all
other
pretty
*NL*
and
well-bred
women
,
--
at
least
according
to
the
Countess
Vronskaya
's
*NL*
ideas
.
But
she
had
heard
of
late
that
her
son
had
refused
a
position
*NL*
offered
him
of
great
importance
to
his
career
,
simply
in
order
to
remain
*NL*
in
the
regiment
,
where
he
could
be
constantly
seeing
Madame
Karenina
.
*NL*
She
learned
that
great
personages
were
displeased
with
him
on
this
*NL*
account
,
and
she
changed
her
opinion
.
She
was
vexed
,
too
,
that
from
all
*NL*
she
could
learn
of
this
connection
it
was
not
that
brilliant
,
graceful
,
*NL*
worldly
_
liaison
_
which
she
would
have
welcomed
,
but
a
sort
of
*NL*
Wertherish
,
desperate
passion
,
so
she
was
told
,
which
might
well
lead
*NL*
him
into
imprudence
.
She
had
not
seen
him
since
his
abrupt
departure
*NL*
from
Moscow
,
and
she
sent
her
elder
son
to
bid
him
come
to
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
elder
son
,
too
,
was
displeased
with
his
younger
brother
.
He
did
not
*NL*
distinguish
what
sort
of
love
his
might
be
,
big
or
little
,
passionate
or
*NL*
passionless
,
lasting
or
passing
-LRB-
he
kept
a
ballet
girl
himself
,
though
*NL*
he
was
the
father
of
a
family
,
so
he
was
lenient
in
these
matters
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
he
knew
that
this
love
affair
was
viewed
with
displeasure
by
those
whom
*NL*
it
was
necessary
to
please
,
and
therefore
he
did
not
approve
of
his
*NL*
brother
's
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
service
and
society
,
Vronsky
had
another
great
*NL*
interest
--
horses
;
he
was
passionately
fond
of
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
year
races
and
a
steeplechase
had
been
arranged
for
the
officers
.
*NL*
Vronsky
had
put
his
name
down
,
bought
a
thoroughbred
English
mare
,
and
*NL*
in
spite
of
his
love
affair
,
he
was
looking
forward
to
the
races
with
*NL*
intense
,
though
reserved
,
excitement
...
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
passions
did
not
interfere
with
one
another
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
he
needed
occupation
and
distraction
quite
apart
from
his
love
,
so
as
to
*NL*
recruit
and
rest
himself
from
the
violent
emotions
that
agitated
him
.

Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
of
the
races
at
Krasnoe
Selo
,
Vronsky
had
come
earlier
than
*NL*
usual
to
eat
beefsteak
in
the
common
messroom
of
the
regiment
.
He
had
no
*NL*
need
to
be
strict
with
himself
,
as
he
had
very
quickly
been
brought
down
*NL*
to
the
required
light
weight
;
but
still
he
had
to
avoid
gaining
flesh
,
*NL*
and
so
he
eschewed
farinaceous
and
sweet
dishes
.
He
sat
with
his
coat
*NL*
unbuttoned
over
a
white
waistcoat
,
resting
both
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
*NL*
while
waiting
for
the
steak
he
had
ordered
he
looked
at
a
French
novel
*NL*
that
lay
open
on
his
plate
.
He
was
only
looking
at
the
book
to
avoid
*NL*
conversation
with
the
officers
coming
in
and
out
;
he
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
of
Anna
's
promise
to
see
him
that
day
after
the
races
.
*NL*
But
he
had
not
seen
her
for
three
days
,
and
as
her
husband
had
just
*NL*
returned
from
abroad
,
he
did
not
know
whether
she
would
be
able
to
meet
*NL*
him
today
or
not
,
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
find
out
.
He
had
had
his
*NL*
last
interview
with
her
at
his
cousin
Betsy
's
summer
villa
.
He
visited
*NL*
the
Karenins
'
summer
villa
as
rarely
as
possible
.
Now
he
wanted
to
go
*NL*
there
,
and
he
pondered
the
question
how
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
shall
say
Betsy
has
sent
me
to
ask
whether
she
's
coming
to
*NL*
the
races
.
Of
course
,
I
'll
go
,
''
he
decided
,
lifting
his
head
from
the
*NL*
book
.
And
as
he
vividly
pictured
the
happiness
of
seeing
her
,
his
face
*NL*
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
to
my
house
,
and
tell
them
to
have
out
the
carriage
and
three
*NL*
horses
as
quick
as
they
can
,
''
he
said
to
the
servant
,
who
handed
him
the
*NL*
steak
on
a
hot
silver
dish
,
and
moving
the
dish
up
he
began
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
billiard
room
next
door
came
the
sound
of
balls
knocking
,
of
*NL*
talk
and
laughter
.
Two
officers
appeared
at
the
entrance-door
:
one
,
a
*NL*
young
fellow
,
with
a
feeble
,
delicate
face
,
who
had
lately
joined
the
*NL*
regiment
from
the
Corps
of
Pages
;
the
other
,
a
plump
,
elderly
officer
,
*NL*
with
a
bracelet
on
his
wrist
,
and
little
eyes
,
lost
in
fat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
glanced
at
them
,
frowned
,
and
looking
down
at
his
book
as
though
*NL*
he
had
not
noticed
them
,
he
proceeded
to
eat
and
read
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
Fortifying
yourself
for
your
work
?
''
said
the
plump
officer
,
*NL*
sitting
down
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
see
,
''
responded
Vronsky
,
knitting
his
brows
,
wiping
his
mouth
,
*NL*
and
not
looking
at
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
not
afraid
of
getting
fat
?
''
said
the
latter
,
turning
a
chair
*NL*
round
for
the
young
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Vronsky
angrily
,
making
a
wry
face
of
disgust
,
and
showing
*NL*
his
even
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
afraid
of
getting
fat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiter
,
sherry
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
without
replying
,
and
moving
the
book
to
*NL*
the
other
side
of
him
,
he
went
on
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plump
officer
took
up
the
list
of
wines
and
turned
to
the
young
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
choose
what
we
're
to
drink
,
''
he
said
,
handing
him
the
card
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rhine
wine
,
please
,
''
said
the
young
officer
,
stealing
a
timid
glance
at
*NL*
Vronsky
,
and
trying
to
pull
his
scarcely
visible
mustache
.
Seeing
that
*NL*
Vronsky
did
not
turn
round
,
the
young
officer
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
into
the
billiard
room
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plump
officer
rose
submissively
,
and
they
moved
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
walked
into
the
room
the
tall
and
well-built
*NL*
Captain
Yashvin
.
Nodding
with
an
air
of
lofty
contempt
to
the
two
*NL*
officers
,
he
went
up
to
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
he
is
!
''
he
cried
,
bringing
his
big
hand
down
heavily
on
his
*NL*
epaulet
.
Vronsky
looked
round
angrily
,
but
his
face
lighted
up
*NL*
immediately
with
his
characteristic
expression
of
genial
and
manly
*NL*
serenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
Alexey
,
''
said
the
captain
,
in
his
loud
baritone
.
``
You
must
*NL*
just
eat
a
mouthful
,
now
,
and
drink
only
one
tiny
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
go
the
inseparables
,
''
Yashvin
dropped
,
glancing
sarcastically
at
*NL*
the
two
officers
who
were
at
that
instant
leaving
the
room
.
And
he
bent
*NL*
his
long
legs
,
swathed
in
tight
riding
breeches
,
and
sat
down
in
the
*NL*
chair
,
too
low
for
him
,
so
that
his
knees
were
cramped
up
in
a
sharp
*NL*
angle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
turn
up
at
the
Red
Theater
yesterday
?
Numerova
was
n't
at
*NL*
all
bad
.
Where
were
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
late
at
the
Tverskoys
'
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
responded
Yashvin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yashvin
,
a
gambler
and
a
rake
,
a
man
not
merely
without
moral
*NL*
principles
,
but
of
immoral
principles
,
Yashvin
was
Vronsky
's
greatest
*NL*
friend
in
the
regiment
.
Vronsky
liked
him
both
for
his
exceptional
*NL*
physical
strength
,
which
he
showed
for
the
most
part
by
being
able
to
*NL*
drink
like
a
fish
,
and
do
without
sleep
without
being
in
the
slightest
*NL*
degree
affected
by
it
;
and
for
his
great
strength
of
character
,
which
he
*NL*
showed
in
his
relations
with
his
comrades
and
superior
officers
,
*NL*
commanding
both
fear
and
respect
,
and
also
at
cards
,
when
he
would
play
*NL*
for
tens
of
thousands
and
however
much
he
might
have
drunk
,
always
with
*NL*
such
skill
and
decision
that
he
was
reckoned
the
best
player
in
the
*NL*
English
Club
.
Vronsky
respected
and
liked
Yashvin
particularly
because
*NL*
he
felt
Yashvin
liked
him
,
not
for
his
name
and
his
money
,
but
for
*NL*
himself
.
And
of
all
men
he
was
the
only
one
with
whom
Vronsky
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
speak
of
his
love
.
He
felt
that
Yashvin
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
apparent
contempt
for
every
sort
of
feeling
,
was
the
only
man
who
could
,
*NL*
so
he
fancied
,
comprehend
the
intense
passion
which
now
filled
his
whole
*NL*
life
.
Moreover
,
he
felt
certain
that
Yashvin
,
as
it
was
,
took
no
delight
*NL*
in
gossip
and
scandal
,
and
interpreted
his
feeling
rightly
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
knew
and
believed
that
this
passion
was
not
a
jest
,
not
a
pastime
,
*NL*
but
something
more
serious
and
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
never
spoken
to
him
of
his
passion
,
but
he
was
aware
that
he
*NL*
knew
all
about
it
,
and
that
he
put
the
right
interpretation
on
it
,
and
*NL*
he
was
glad
to
see
that
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
,
''
he
said
,
to
the
announcement
that
Vronsky
had
been
at
the
*NL*
Tverskoys
'
;
and
his
black
eyes
shining
,
he
plucked
at
his
left
mustache
,
*NL*
and
began
twisting
it
into
his
mouth
,
a
bad
habit
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
did
you
do
yesterday
?
Win
anything
?
''
asked
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
thousand
.
But
three
do
n't
count
;
he
wo
n't
pay
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
you
can
afford
to
lose
over
me
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
laughing
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Yashvin
had
bet
heavily
on
Vronsky
in
the
races
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
chance
of
my
losing
.
Mahotin
's
the
only
one
that
's
risky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
conversation
passed
to
forecasts
of
the
coming
race
,
the
only
*NL*
thing
Vronsky
could
think
of
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
I
've
finished
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
and
getting
up
he
went
to
the
*NL*
door
.
Yashvin
got
up
too
,
stretching
his
long
legs
and
his
long
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
early
for
me
to
dine
,
but
I
must
have
a
drink
.
I
'll
come
along
*NL*
directly
.
Hi
,
wine
!
''
he
shouted
,
in
his
rich
voice
,
that
always
rang
out
*NL*
so
loudly
at
drill
,
and
set
the
windows
shaking
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
all
right
,
''
he
shouted
again
immediately
after
.
``
You
're
going
home
,
*NL*
so
I
'll
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
walked
out
with
Vronsky
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
staying
in
a
roomy
,
clean
,
Finnish
hut
,
divided
into
two
by
*NL*
a
partition
.
Petritsky
lived
with
him
in
camp
too
.
Petritsky
was
asleep
*NL*
when
Vronsky
and
Yashvin
came
into
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
,
do
n't
go
on
sleeping
,
''
said
Yashvin
,
going
behind
the
partition
*NL*
and
giving
Petritsky
,
who
was
lying
with
ruffled
hair
and
with
his
nose
*NL*
in
the
pillow
,
a
prod
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petritsky
jumped
up
suddenly
onto
his
knees
and
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
's
been
here
,
''
he
said
to
Vronsky
.
``
He
waked
me
up
,
damn
*NL*
him
,
and
said
he
'd
look
in
again
.
''
And
pulling
up
the
rug
he
flung
*NL*
himself
back
on
the
pillow
.
``
Oh
,
do
shut
up
,
Yashvin
!
''
he
said
,
getting
*NL*
furious
with
Yashvin
,
who
was
pulling
the
rug
off
him
.
``
Shut
up
!
''
He
*NL*
turned
over
and
opened
his
eyes
.
``
You
'd
better
tell
me
what
to
drink
;
*NL*
such
a
nasty
taste
in
my
mouth
,
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brandy
's
better
than
anything
,
''
boomed
Yashvin
.
``
Tereshtchenko
!
brandy
*NL*
for
your
master
and
cucumbers
,
''
he
shouted
,
obviously
taking
pleasure
in
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brandy
,
do
you
think
?
Eh
?
''
queried
Petritsky
,
blinking
and
rubbing
his
*NL*
eyes
.
``
And
you
'll
drink
something
?
All
right
then
,
we
'll
have
a
drink
*NL*
together
!
Vronsky
,
have
a
drink
?
''
said
Petritsky
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
wrapping
the
tiger-skin
rug
round
him
.
He
went
to
the
door
of
the
*NL*
partition
wall
,
raised
his
hands
,
and
hummed
in
French
,
``
There
was
a
*NL*
king
in
Thule
.
''
``
Vronsky
,
will
you
have
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
putting
on
the
coat
his
valet
handed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
asked
Yashvin
.
``
Oh
,
here
are
your
three
horses
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
seeing
the
carriage
drive
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
stables
,
and
I
've
got
to
see
Bryansky
,
too
,
about
the
horses
,
''
*NL*
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
as
a
fact
promised
to
call
at
Bryansky
's
,
some
eight
miles
*NL*
from
Peterhof
,
and
to
bring
him
some
money
owing
for
some
horses
;
and
he
*NL*
hoped
to
have
time
to
get
that
in
too
.
But
his
comrades
were
at
once
*NL*
aware
that
he
was
not
only
going
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petritsky
,
still
humming
,
winked
and
made
a
pout
with
his
lips
,
as
*NL*
though
he
would
say
:
``
Oh
,
yes
,
we
know
your
Bryansky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
're
not
late
!
''
was
Yashvin
's
only
comment
;
and
to
change
the
*NL*
conversation
:
``
How
's
my
roan
?
is
he
doing
all
right
?
''
he
inquired
,
*NL*
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
middle
one
of
the
three
horses
,
which
*NL*
he
had
sold
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
cried
Petritsky
to
Vronsky
as
he
was
just
going
out
.
``
Your
*NL*
brother
left
a
letter
and
a
note
for
you
.
Wait
a
bit
;
where
are
they
?

*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
That
's
just
the
question
!
''
said
Petritsky
solemnly
,
*NL*
moving
his
forefinger
upwards
from
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
;
this
is
silly
!

said
Vronsky
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
lighted
the
fire
.
Here
somewhere
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
enough
fooling
!
Where
is
the
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
forgotten
really

Or
was
it
a
dream
?
Wait
a
bit
,
wait
a
bit
!
*NL*
But
what
's
the
use
of
getting
in
a
rage
.
If
you
'd
drunk
four
bottles
*NL*
yesterday
as
I
did
you
'd
forget
where
you
were
lying
.
Wait
a
bit
,
I
'll
*NL*
remember
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petritsky
went
behind
the
partition
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
!
This
was
how
I
was
lying
,
and
this
was
how
he
was
standing
.
*NL*
Yes
--
yes
--
yes
...
Here
it
is
!
''
--
and
Petritsky
pulled
a
letter
out
from
*NL*
under
the
mattress
,
where
he
had
hidden
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
took
the
letter
and
his
brother
's
note
.
It
was
the
letter
he
was
*NL*
expecting
--
from
his
mother
,
reproaching
him
for
not
having
been
to
see
*NL*
her
--
and
the
note
was
from
his
brother
to
say
that
he
must
have
a
little
*NL*
talk
with
him
.
Vronsky
knew
that
it
was
all
about
the
same
thing
.
``
What
*NL*
business
is
it
of
theirs
!
''
thought
Vronsky
,
and
crumpling
up
the
letters
*NL*
he
thrust
them
between
the
buttons
of
his
coat
so
as
to
read
them
*NL*
carefully
on
the
road
.
In
the
porch
of
the
hut
he
was
met
by
two
*NL*
officers
;
one
of
his
regiment
and
one
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
quarters
were
always
a
meeting
place
for
all
the
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
to
Peterhof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
mare
come
from
Tsarskoe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
've
not
seen
her
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
Mahotin
's
Gladiator
's
lame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
But
however
are
you
going
to
race
in
this
mud
?
''
said
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
my
saviors
!
''
cried
Petritsky
,
seeing
them
come
in
.
Before
him
*NL*
stood
the
orderly
with
a
tray
of
brandy
and
salted
cucumbers
.
``
Here
's
*NL*
Yashvin
ordering
me
to
drink
a
pick-me-up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
did
give
it
to
us
yesterday
,
''
said
one
of
those
who
had
come
*NL*
in
;
``
you
did
n't
let
us
get
a
wink
of
sleep
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
n't
we
make
a
pretty
finish
!
''
said
Petritsky
.
``
Volkov
climbed
*NL*
onto
the
roof
and
began
telling
us
how
sad
he
was
.
I
said
:
`
Let
's
have
*NL*
music
,
the
funeral
march
!
'
He
fairly
dropped
asleep
on
the
roof
over
the
*NL*
funeral
march
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
it
up
;
you
positively
must
drink
the
brandy
,
and
then
seltzer
*NL*
water

a

lemon

said
Yashvin
,
standing
over
Petritsky
like
a
*NL*
mother
making
a
child
take
medicine
,
``
and
then
a
little
champagne
--
just
*NL*
a
small
bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
there
's
some
sense
in
that
.
Stop
a
bit

Vronsky

We
'll
all

*NL*
drink

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

of

not
going

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

are
you
gaining
weight

All
right

then
we
must
have
it
alone

Give
us
the
seltzer
water

lemon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Vronsky

''
shouted
someone
when
he
was
already
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
get
your
hair
cut

it
'll
weigh
you
down

especially
at
the

top

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
in
fact
beginning
,
prematurely
,
to
get
a
little
bald
.
He
*NL*
laughed
gaily
,
showing
his
even
teeth
,
and
pulling
his
cap
over
the
thin
*NL*
place
,
went
out
and
got
into
his
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
stables
!
''
he
said
,
and
was
just
pulling
out
the
letters
to
read
*NL*
them
through
,
but
he
thought
better
of
it
,
and
put
off
reading
them
so
*NL*
as
not
to
distract
his
attention
before
looking
at
the
mare
.

Later

Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
temporary
stable
,
a
wooden
shed
,
had
been
put
up
close
to
the
race
*NL*
course
,
and
there
his
mare
was
to
have
been
taken
the
previous
day
.
He
*NL*
had
not
yet
seen
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
few
days
he
had
not
ridden
her
out
for
exercise
himself
,
*NL*
but
had
put
her
in
the
charge
of
the
trainer
,
and
so
now
he
positively
*NL*
did
not
know
in
what
condition
his
mare
had
arrived
yesterday
and
was
*NL*
today
.
He
had
scarcely
got
out
of
his
carriage
when
his
groom
,
the
*NL*
so-called
``
stable
boy
,
''
recognizing
the
carriage
some
way
off
,
called
*NL*
the
trainer
.
A
dry-looking
Englishman
,
in
high
boots
and
a
short
jacket
,
*NL*
clean-shaven
,
except
for
a
tuft
below
his
chin
,
came
to
meet
him
,
*NL*
walking
with
the
uncouth
gait
of
jockey
,
turning
his
elbows
out
and
*NL*
swaying
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
's
Frou-Frou
?
''
Vronsky
asked
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
sir
,
''
the
Englishman
's
voice
responded
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
inside
of
his
throat
.
``
Better
not
go
in
,
''
he
added
,
touching
his
hat
.
*NL*
``
I
've
put
a
muzzle
on
her
,
and
the
mare
's
fidgety
.
Better
not
go
in
,
*NL*
it
'll
excite
the
mare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
going
in
.
I
want
to
look
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
then
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
frowning
,
and
speaking
with
his
*NL*
mouth
shut
,
and
,
with
swinging
elbows
,
he
went
on
in
front
with
his
*NL*
disjointed
gait
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
little
yard
in
front
of
the
shed
.
A
stable
boy
,
*NL*
spruce
and
smart
in
his
holiday
attire
,
met
them
with
a
broom
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
followed
them
.
In
the
shed
there
were
five
horses
in
their
*NL*
separate
stalls
,
and
Vronsky
knew
that
his
chief
rival
,
Gladiator
,
a
*NL*
very
tall
chestnut
horse
,
had
been
brought
there
,
and
must
be
standing
*NL*
among
them
.
Even
more
than
his
mare
,
Vronsky
longed
to
see
Gladiator
,
*NL*
whom
he
had
never
seen
.
But
he
knew
that
by
the
etiquette
of
the
race
*NL*
course
it
was
not
merely
impossible
for
him
to
see
the
horse
,
but
*NL*
improper
even
to
ask
questions
about
him
.
Just
as
he
was
passing
along
*NL*
the
passage
,
the
boy
opened
the
door
into
the
second
horse-box
on
the
*NL*
left
,
and
Vronsky
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
big
chestnut
horse
with
white
*NL*
legs
.
He
knew
that
this
was
Gladiator
,
but
,
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
*NL*
turning
away
from
the
sight
of
another
man
's
open
letter
,
he
turned
*NL*
round
and
went
into
Frou-Frou
's
stall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horse
is
here
belonging
to
Mak
...
Mak
...
I
never
can
say
the
name
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Englishman
,
over
his
shoulder
,
pointing
his
big
finger
and
*NL*
dirty
nail
towards
Gladiator
's
stall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mahotin
?
Yes
,
he
's
my
most
serious
rival
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
riding
him
,
''
said
the
Englishman
,
``
I
'd
bet
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frou-Frou
's
more
nervous
;
he
's
stronger
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
smiling
at
the
*NL*
compliment
to
his
riding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
steeplechase
it
all
depends
on
riding
and
on
pluck
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
pluck
--
that
is
,
energy
and
courage
--
Vronsky
did
not
merely
feel
that
*NL*
he
had
enough
;
what
was
of
far
more
importance
,
he
was
firmly
convinced
*NL*
that
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
more
of
this
``
pluck
''
than
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
I
want
more
thinning
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
answered
the
Englishman
.
``
Please
,
do
n't
speak
loud
.
The
mare
's
*NL*
fidgety
,
''
he
added
,
nodding
towards
the
horse-box
,
before
which
they
*NL*
were
standing
,
and
from
which
came
the
sound
of
restless
stamping
in
the
*NL*
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
door
,
and
Vronsky
went
into
the
horse-box
,
dimly
lighted
*NL*
by
one
little
window
.
In
the
horse-box
stood
a
dark
bay
mare
,
with
a
*NL*
muzzle
on
,
picking
at
the
fresh
straw
with
her
hoofs
.
Looking
round
him
*NL*
in
the
twilight
of
the
horse-box
,
Vronsky
unconsciously
took
in
once
*NL*
more
in
a
comprehensive
glance
all
the
points
of
his
favorite
mare
.
*NL*
Frou-Frou
was
a
beast
of
medium
size
,
not
altogether
free
from
reproach
,
*NL*
from
a
breeder
's
point
of
view
.
She
was
small-boned
all
over
;
though
her
*NL*
chest
was
extremely
prominent
in
front
,
it
was
narrow
.
Her
hind-quarters
*NL*
were
a
little
drooping
,
and
in
her
fore-legs
,
and
still
more
in
her
*NL*
hind-legs
,
there
was
a
noticeable
curvature
.
The
muscles
of
both
hind
-
*NL*
and
fore-legs
were
not
very
thick
;
but
across
her
shoulders
the
mare
was
*NL*
exceptionally
broad
,
a
peculiarity
specially
striking
now
that
she
was
*NL*
lean
from
training
.
The
bones
of
her
legs
below
the
knees
looked
no
*NL*
thicker
than
a
finger
from
in
front
,
but
were
extraordinarily
thick
seen
*NL*
from
the
side
.
She
looked
altogether
,
except
across
the
shoulders
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
pinched
in
at
the
sides
and
pressed
out
in
depth
.
But
she
had
in
*NL*
the
highest
degree
the
quality
that
makes
all
defects
forgotten
:
that
*NL*
quality
was
_
blood
_
,
the
blood
_
that
tells
_
,
as
the
English
expression
*NL*
has
it
.
The
muscles
stood
up
sharply
under
the
network
of
sinews
,
*NL*
covered
with
the
delicate
,
mobile
skin
,
soft
as
satin
,
and
they
were
*NL*
hard
as
bone
.
Her
clean-cut
head
,
with
prominent
,
bright
,
spirited
eyes
,
*NL*
broadened
out
at
the
open
nostrils
,
that
showed
the
red
blood
in
the
*NL*
cartilage
within
.
About
all
her
figure
,
and
especially
her
head
,
there
*NL*
was
a
certain
expression
of
energy
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
softness
.
*NL*
She
was
one
of
those
creatures
which
seem
only
not
to
speak
because
the
*NL*
mechanism
of
their
mouth
does
not
allow
them
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Vronsky
,
at
any
rate
,
it
seemed
that
she
understood
all
he
felt
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
Vronsky
went
towards
her
,
she
drew
in
a
deep
breath
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
back
her
prominent
eye
till
the
white
looked
bloodshot
,
she
*NL*
started
at
the
approaching
figures
from
the
opposite
side
,
shaking
her
*NL*
muzzle
,
and
shifting
lightly
from
one
leg
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
how
fidgety
she
is
,
''
said
the
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
darling
!
There
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
going
up
to
the
mare
and
speaking
*NL*
soothingly
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
nearer
he
came
,
the
more
excited
she
grew
.
Only
when
he
stood
by
*NL*
her
head
,
she
was
suddenly
quieter
,
while
the
muscles
quivered
under
her
*NL*
soft
,
delicate
coat
.
Vronsky
patted
her
strong
neck
,
straightened
over
*NL*
her
sharp
withers
a
stray
lock
of
her
mane
that
had
fallen
on
the
other
*NL*
side
,
and
moved
his
face
near
her
dilated
nostrils
,
transparent
as
a
*NL*
bat
's
wing
.
She
drew
a
loud
breath
and
snorted
out
through
her
tense
*NL*
nostrils
,
started
,
pricked
up
her
sharp
ear
,
and
put
out
her
strong
,
*NL*
black
lip
towards
Vronsky
,
as
though
she
would
nip
hold
of
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
But
remembering
the
muzzle
,
she
shook
it
and
again
began
restlessly
*NL*
stamping
one
after
the
other
her
shapely
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quiet
,
darling
,
quiet
!
''
he
said
,
patting
her
again
over
her
*NL*
hind-quarters
;
and
with
a
glad
sense
that
his
mare
was
in
the
best
*NL*
possible
condition
,
he
went
out
of
the
horse-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mare
's
excitement
had
infected
Vronsky
.
He
felt
that
his
heart
was
*NL*
throbbing
,
and
that
he
,
too
,
like
the
mare
,
longed
to
move
,
to
bite
;
it
*NL*
was
both
dreadful
and
delicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
rely
on
you
,
then
,
''
he
said
to
the
Englishman
;
``
half-past
six
*NL*
on
the
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
Englishman
.
``
Oh
,
where
are
you
going
,
my
lord
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
suddenly
,
using
the
title
``
my
lord
,
''
which
he
had
scarcely
ever
*NL*
used
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
in
amazement
raised
his
head
,
and
stared
,
as
he
knew
how
to
*NL*
stare
,
not
into
the
Englishman
's
eyes
,
but
at
his
forehead
,
astounded
at
*NL*
the
impertinence
of
his
question
.
But
realizing
that
in
asking
this
the
*NL*
Englishman
had
been
looking
at
him
not
as
an
employer
,
but
as
a
jockey
,
*NL*
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
go
to
Bryansky
's
;
I
shall
be
home
within
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
I
'm
asked
that
question
today
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
he
*NL*
blushed
,
a
thing
which
rarely
happened
to
him
.
The
Englishman
looked
*NL*
gravely
at
him
;
and
,
as
though
he
,
too
,
knew
where
Vronsky
was
going
,
he
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
thing
's
to
keep
quiet
before
a
race
,
''
said
he
;
``
do
n't
get
out
*NL*
of
temper
or
upset
about
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
answered
Vronsky
,
smiling
;
and
jumping
into
his
carriage
,
*NL*
he
told
the
man
to
drive
to
Peterhof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
had
driven
many
paces
away
,
the
dark
clouds
that
had
been
*NL*
threatening
rain
all
day
broke
,
and
there
was
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
''
thought
Vronsky
,
putting
up
the
roof
of
the
carriage
.
``
It
*NL*
was
muddy
before
,
now
it
will
be
a
perfect
swamp
.
''
As
he
sat
in
solitude
*NL*
in
the
closed
carriage
,
he
took
out
his
mother
's
letter
and
his
*NL*
brother
's
note
,
and
read
them
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
.
Everyone
,
his
mother
,
*NL*
his
brother
,
everyone
thought
fit
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
his
*NL*
heart
.
This
interference
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
of
angry
hatred
--
a
*NL*
feeling
he
had
rarely
known
before
.
``
What
business
is
it
of
theirs
?
Why
*NL*
does
everybody
feel
called
upon
to
concern
himself
about
me
?
And
why
do
*NL*
they
worry
me
so
?
Just
because
they
see
that
this
is
something
they
*NL*
ca
n't
understand
.
If
it
were
a
common
,
vulgar
,
worldly
intrigue
,
they
*NL*
would
have
left
me
alone
.
They
feel
that
this
is
something
different
,
*NL*
that
this
is
not
a
mere
pastime
,
that
this
woman
is
dearer
to
me
than
*NL*
life
.
And
this
is
incomprehensible
,
and
that
's
why
it
annoys
them
.
*NL*
Whatever
our
destiny
is
or
may
be
,
we
have
made
it
ourselves
,
and
we
do
*NL*
not
complain
of
it
,
''
he
said
,
in
the
word
_
we
_
linking
himself
with
*NL*
Anna
.
``
No
,
they
must
needs
teach
us
how
to
live
.
They
have
n't
an
idea
of
*NL*
what
happiness
is
;
they
do
n't
know
that
without
our
love
,
for
us
there
*NL*
is
neither
happiness
nor
unhappiness
--
no
life
at
all
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
angry
with
all
of
them
for
their
interference
just
because
he
*NL*
felt
in
his
soul
that
they
,
all
these
people
,
were
right
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
the
love
that
bound
him
to
Anna
was
not
a
momentary
impulse
,
which
would
*NL*
pass
,
as
worldly
intrigues
do
pass
,
leaving
no
other
traces
in
the
life
*NL*
of
either
but
pleasant
or
unpleasant
memories
.
He
felt
all
the
torture
*NL*
of
his
own
and
her
position
,
all
the
difficulty
there
was
for
them
,
*NL*
conspicuous
as
they
were
in
the
eye
of
all
the
world
,
in
concealing
*NL*
their
love
,
in
lying
and
deceiving
;
and
in
lying
,
deceiving
,
feigning
,
*NL*
and
continually
thinking
of
others
,
when
the
passion
that
united
them
*NL*
was
so
intense
that
they
were
both
oblivious
of
everything
else
but
*NL*
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
vividly
recalled
all
the
constantly
recurring
instances
of
inevitable
*NL*
necessity
for
lying
and
deceit
,
which
were
so
against
his
natural
bent
.
*NL*
He
recalled
particularly
vividly
the
shame
he
had
more
than
once
*NL*
detected
in
her
at
this
necessity
for
lying
and
deceit
.
And
he
*NL*
experienced
the
strange
feeling
that
had
sometimes
come
upon
him
since
*NL*
his
secret
love
for
Anna
.
This
was
a
feeling
of
loathing
for
*NL*
something
--
whether
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
or
for
himself
,
or
for
the
*NL*
whole
world
,
he
could
not
have
said
.
But
he
always
drove
away
this
*NL*
strange
feeling
.
Now
,
too
,
he
shook
it
off
and
continued
the
thread
of
*NL*
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
was
unhappy
before
,
but
proud
and
at
peace
;
and
now
she
can
not
*NL*
be
at
peace
and
feel
secure
in
her
dignity
,
though
she
does
not
show
it
.
*NL*
Yes
,
we
must
put
an
end
to
it
,
''
he
decided
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
the
first
time
the
idea
clearly
presented
itself
that
it
was
*NL*
essential
to
put
an
end
to
this
false
position
,
and
the
sooner
the
*NL*
better
.
``
Throw
up
everything
,
she
and
I
,
and
hide
ourselves
somewhere
*NL*
alone
with
our
love
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
did
not
last
long
,
and
by
the
time
Vronsky
arrived
,
his
*NL*
shaft-horse
trotting
at
full
speed
and
dragging
the
trace-horses
*NL*
galloping
through
the
mud
,
with
their
reins
hanging
loose
,
the
sun
had
*NL*
peeped
out
again
,
the
roofs
of
the
summer
villas
and
the
old
limetrees
*NL*
in
the
gardens
on
both
sides
of
the
principal
streets
sparkled
with
wet
*NL*
brilliance
,
and
from
the
twigs
came
a
pleasant
drip
and
from
the
roofs
*NL*
rushing
streams
of
water
.
He
thought
no
more
of
the
shower
spoiling
the
*NL*
race
course
,
but
was
rejoicing
now
that
--
thanks
to
the
rain
--
he
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
find
her
at
home
and
alone
,
as
he
knew
that
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
who
had
lately
returned
from
a
foreign
watering
place
,
*NL*
had
not
moved
from
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hoping
to
find
her
alone
,
Vronsky
alighted
,
as
he
always
did
,
to
avoid
*NL*
attracting
attention
,
before
crossing
the
bridge
,
and
walked
to
the
*NL*
house
.
He
did
not
go
up
the
steps
to
the
street
door
,
but
went
into
the
*NL*
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
your
master
come
?
''
he
asked
a
gardener
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
The
mistress
is
at
home
.
But
will
you
please
go
to
the
front
*NL*
door
;
there
are
servants
there
,
''
the
gardener
answered
.
``
They
'll
open
*NL*
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
go
in
from
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
feeling
satisfied
that
she
was
alone
,
and
wanting
to
take
her
by
*NL*
surprise
,
since
he
had
not
promised
to
be
there
today
,
and
she
would
*NL*
certainly
not
expect
him
to
come
before
the
races
,
he
walked
,
holding
*NL*
his
sword
and
stepping
cautiously
over
the
sandy
path
,
bordered
with
*NL*
flowers
,
to
the
terrace
that
looked
out
upon
the
garden
.
Vronsky
forgot
*NL*
now
all
that
he
had
thought
on
the
way
of
the
hardships
and
difficulties
*NL*
of
their
position
.
He
thought
of
nothing
but
that
he
would
see
her
*NL*
directly
,
not
in
imagination
,
but
living
,
all
of
her
,
as
she
was
in
*NL*
reality
.
He
was
just
going
in
,
stepping
on
his
whole
foot
so
as
not
to
*NL*
creak
,
up
the
worn
steps
of
the
terrace
,
when
he
suddenly
remembered
*NL*
what
he
always
forgot
,
and
what
caused
the
most
torturing
side
of
his
*NL*
relations
with
her
,
her
son
with
his
questioning
--
hostile
,
as
he
*NL*
fancied
--
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
boy
was
more
often
than
anyone
else
a
check
upon
their
freedom
.
*NL*
When
he
was
present
,
both
Vronsky
and
Anna
did
not
merely
avoid
speaking
*NL*
of
anything
that
they
could
not
have
repeated
before
everyone
;
they
did
*NL*
not
even
allow
themselves
to
refer
by
hints
to
anything
the
boy
did
not
*NL*
understand
.
They
had
made
no
agreement
about
this
,
it
had
settled
*NL*
itself
.
They
would
have
felt
it
wounding
themselves
to
deceive
the
*NL*
child
.
In
his
presence
they
talked
like
acquaintances
.
But
in
spite
of
*NL*
this
caution
,
Vronsky
often
saw
the
child
's
intent
,
bewildered
glance
*NL*
fixed
upon
him
,
and
a
strange
shyness
,
uncertainty
,
at
one
time
*NL*
friendliness
,
at
another
,
coldness
and
reserve
,
in
the
boy
's
manner
to
*NL*
him
;
as
though
the
child
felt
that
between
this
man
and
his
mother
there
*NL*
existed
some
important
bond
,
the
significance
of
which
he
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
fact
,
the
boy
did
feel
that
he
could
not
understand
this
relation
,
*NL*
and
he
tried
painfully
,
and
was
not
able
to
make
clear
to
himself
what
*NL*
feeling
he
ought
to
have
for
this
man
.
With
a
child
's
keen
instinct
for
*NL*
every
manifestation
of
feeling
,
he
saw
distinctly
that
his
father
,
his
*NL*
governess
,
his
nurse
,
--
all
did
not
merely
dislike
Vronsky
,
but
looked
on
*NL*
him
with
horror
and
aversion
,
though
they
never
said
anything
about
him
,
*NL*
while
his
mother
looked
on
him
as
her
greatest
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
?
Who
is
he
?
How
ought
I
to
love
him
?
If
I
do
n't
know
,
*NL*
it
's
my
fault
;
either
I
'm
stupid
or
a
naughty
boy
,
''
thought
the
child
.
*NL*
And
this
was
what
caused
his
dubious
,
inquiring
,
sometimes
hostile
,
*NL*
expression
,
and
the
shyness
and
uncertainty
which
Vronsky
found
so
*NL*
irksome
.
This
child
's
presence
always
and
infallibly
called
up
in
*NL*
Vronsky
that
strange
feeling
of
inexplicable
loathing
which
he
had
*NL*
experienced
of
late
.
This
child
's
presence
called
up
both
in
Vronsky
and
*NL*
in
Anna
a
feeling
akin
to
the
feeling
of
a
sailor
who
sees
by
the
*NL*
compass
that
the
direction
in
which
he
is
swiftly
moving
is
far
from
the
*NL*
right
one
,
but
that
to
arrest
his
motion
is
not
in
his
power
,
that
every
*NL*
instant
is
carrying
him
further
and
further
away
,
and
that
to
admit
to
*NL*
himself
his
deviation
from
the
right
direction
is
the
same
as
admitting
*NL*
his
certain
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
child
,
with
his
innocent
outlook
upon
life
,
was
the
compass
that
*NL*
showed
them
the
point
to
which
they
had
departed
from
what
they
knew
,
*NL*
but
did
not
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
Seryozha
was
not
at
home
,
and
she
was
completely
alone
.
She
*NL*
was
sitting
on
the
terrace
waiting
for
the
return
of
her
son
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
out
for
his
walk
and
been
caught
in
the
rain
.
She
had
sent
a
*NL*
manservant
and
a
maid
out
to
look
for
him
.
Dressed
in
a
white
gown
,
*NL*
deeply
embroidered
,
she
was
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
terrace
behind
*NL*
some
flowers
,
and
did
not
hear
him
.
Bending
her
curly
black
head
,
she
*NL*
pressed
her
forehead
against
a
cool
watering
pot
that
stood
on
the
*NL*
parapet
,
and
both
her
lovely
hands
,
with
the
rings
he
knew
so
well
,
*NL*
clasped
the
pot
.
The
beauty
of
her
whole
figure
,
her
head
,
her
neck
,
her
*NL*
hands
,
struck
Vronsky
every
time
as
something
new
and
unexpected
.
He
*NL*
stood
still
,
gazing
at
her
in
ecstasy
.
But
,
directly
he
would
have
made
*NL*
a
step
to
come
nearer
to
her
,
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
,
pushed
away
*NL*
the
watering
pot
,
and
turned
her
flushed
face
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
You
are
ill
?
''
he
said
to
her
in
French
,
going
up
to
*NL*
her
.
He
would
have
run
to
her
,
but
remembering
that
there
might
be
*NL*
spectators
,
he
looked
round
towards
the
balcony
door
,
and
reddened
a
*NL*
little
,
as
he
always
reddened
,
feeling
that
he
had
to
be
afraid
and
be
*NL*
on
his
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
quite
well
,
''
she
said
,
getting
up
and
pressing
his
outstretched
*NL*
hand
tightly
.
``
I
did
not
expect
...
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
what
cold
hands
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
startled
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
alone
,
and
expecting
Seryozha
;
he
's
*NL*
out
for
a
walk
;
they
'll
come
in
from
this
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
be
calm
,
her
lips
were
quivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
coming
,
but
I
could
n't
pass
the
day
without
seeing
you
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
speaking
French
,
as
he
always
did
to
avoid
using
the
stiff
*NL*
Russian
plural
form
,
so
impossibly
frigid
between
them
,
and
the
*NL*
dangerously
intimate
singular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
you
?
I
'm
so
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
ill
or
worried
,
''
he
went
on
,
not
letting
go
her
hands
and
*NL*
bending
over
her
.
``
What
were
you
thinking
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
the
same
thing
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
the
truth
.
If
ever
at
any
moment
she
had
been
asked
what
she
*NL*
was
thinking
of
,
she
could
have
answered
truly
:
of
the
same
thing
,
of
*NL*
her
happiness
and
her
unhappiness
.
She
was
thinking
,
just
when
he
came
*NL*
upon
her
,
of
this
:
why
was
it
,
she
wondered
,
that
to
others
,
to
Betsy
*NL*
-LRB-
she
knew
of
her
secret
connection
with
Tushkevitch
-RRB-
it
was
all
easy
,
*NL*
while
to
her
it
was
such
torture
?
Today
this
thought
gained
special
*NL*
poignancy
from
certain
other
considerations
.
She
asked
him
about
the
*NL*
races
.
He
answered
her
questions
,
and
,
seeing
that
she
was
agitated
,
*NL*
trying
to
calm
her
,
he
began
telling
her
in
the
simplest
tone
the
*NL*
details
of
his
preparations
for
the
races
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
or
not
tell
him
?
''
she
thought
,
looking
into
his
quiet
,
*NL*
affectionate
eyes
.
``
He
is
so
happy
,
so
absorbed
in
his
races
that
he
*NL*
wo
n't
understand
as
he
ought
,
he
wo
n't
understand
all
the
gravity
of
*NL*
this
fact
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
n't
told
me
what
you
were
thinking
of
when
I
came
in
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
interrupting
his
narrative
;
``
please
tell
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
,
and
,
bending
her
head
a
little
,
she
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
him
from
under
her
brows
,
her
eyes
shining
under
their
*NL*
long
lashes
.
Her
hand
shook
as
it
played
with
a
leaf
she
had
picked
.
He
*NL*
saw
it
,
and
his
face
expressed
that
utter
subjection
,
that
slavish
*NL*
devotion
,
which
had
done
so
much
to
win
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
something
has
happened
.
Do
you
suppose
I
can
be
at
peace
,
knowing
*NL*
you
have
a
trouble
I
am
not
sharing
?
Tell
me
,
for
God
's
sake
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
imploringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
forgive
him
if
he
does
not
realize
all
the
*NL*
gravity
of
it
.
Better
not
tell
;
why
put
him
to
the
proof
?
''
she
thought
,
*NL*
still
staring
at
him
in
the
same
way
,
and
feeling
the
hand
that
held
the
*NL*
leaf
was
trembling
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
!
''
he
repeated
,
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
with
child
,
''
she
said
,
softly
and
deliberately
.
The
leaf
in
her
*NL*
hand
shook
more
violently
,
but
she
did
not
take
her
eyes
off
him
,
*NL*
watching
how
he
would
take
it
.
He
turned
white
,
would
have
said
*NL*
something
,
but
stopped
;
he
dropped
her
hand
,
and
his
head
sank
on
his
*NL*
breast
.
``
Yes
,
he
realizes
all
the
gravity
of
it
,
''
she
thought
,
and
*NL*
gratefully
she
pressed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
mistaken
in
thinking
he
realized
the
gravity
of
the
fact
as
*NL*
she
,
a
woman
,
realized
it
.
On
hearing
it
,
he
felt
come
upon
him
with
*NL*
tenfold
intensity
that
strange
feeling
of
loathing
of
someone
.
But
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
he
felt
that
the
turning-point
he
had
been
longing
for
*NL*
had
come
now
;
that
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
concealing
things
from
her
*NL*
husband
,
and
it
was
inevitable
in
one
way
or
another
that
they
should
*NL*
soon
put
an
end
to
their
unnatural
position
.
But
,
besides
that
,
her
*NL*
emotion
physically
affected
him
in
the
same
way
.
He
looked
at
her
with
a
*NL*
look
of
submissive
tenderness
,
kissed
her
hand
,
got
up
,
and
,
in
silence
,
*NL*
paced
up
and
down
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
going
up
to
her
resolutely
.
``
Neither
you
nor
I
have
*NL*
looked
on
our
relations
as
a
passing
amusement
,
and
now
our
fate
is
*NL*
sealed
.
It
is
absolutely
necessary
to
put
an
end
''
--
he
looked
round
as
he
*NL*
spoke
--
``
to
the
deception
in
which
we
are
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
an
end
?
How
put
an
end
,
Alexey
?
''
she
said
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
calmer
now
,
and
her
face
lighted
up
with
a
tender
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
your
husband
and
make
our
life
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
one
as
it
is
,
''
she
answered
,
scarcely
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
altogether
;
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
,
Alexey
,
tell
me
how
?
''
she
said
in
melancholy
mockery
at
the
*NL*
hopelessness
of
her
own
position
.
``
Is
there
any
way
out
of
such
a
*NL*
position
?
Am
I
not
the
wife
of
my
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
way
out
of
every
position
.
We
must
take
our
line
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Anything
's
better
than
the
position
in
which
you
're
living
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
I
see
how
you
torture
yourself
over
everything
--
the
world
and
your
son
*NL*
and
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
over
my
husband
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
quiet
smile
.
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
him
,
I
do
n't
think
of
him

He
does
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not

I
know

You
worry
about
him
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
does
n't
even
know
,
''
she
said
,
and
suddenly
a
hot
flush
came
over
*NL*
her
face
;
her
cheeks
,
her
brow
,
her
neck
crimsoned
,
and
tears
of
shame
*NL*
came
into
her
eyes
.
``
But
we
wo
n't
talk
of
him

Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
several
times
already
,
though
not
so
resolutely
as
now
,
*NL*
tried
to
bring
her
to
consider
their
position
,
and
every
time
he
had
*NL*
been
confronted
by
the
same
superficiality
and
triviality
with
which
she
*NL*
met
his
appeal
now
.
It
was
as
though
there
were
something
in
this
which
*NL*
she
could
not
or
would
not
face
,
as
though
directly
she
began
to
speak
*NL*
of
this
,
she
,
the
real
Anna
,
retreated
somehow
into
herself
,
and
another
*NL*
strange
and
unaccountable
woman
came
out
,
whom
he
did
not
love
,
and
whom
*NL*
he
feared
,
and
who
was
in
opposition
to
him
.
But
today
he
was
resolved
*NL*
to
have
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
he
knows
or
not
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
in
his
usual
quiet
and
resolute
*NL*
tone
,
``
that
's
nothing
to
do
with
us
.
We
can
not
...
you
can
not
stay
like
*NL*
this
,
especially
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
to
be
done
,
according
to
you
?
''
she
asked
with
the
same
frivolous
*NL*
irony
.
She
who
had
so
feared
he
would
take
her
condition
too
lightly
was
*NL*
now
vexed
with
him
for
deducing
from
it
the
necessity
of
taking
some
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
everything
,
and
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
let
us
suppose
I
do
that
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
you
know
what
the
*NL*
result
of
that
would
be
?
I
can
tell
you
it
all
beforehand
,
''
and
a
wicked
*NL*
light
gleamed
in
her
eyes
,
that
had
been
so
soft
a
minute
before
.
''
`
Eh
,
*NL*
you
love
another
man
,
and
have
entered
into
criminal
intrigues
with
*NL*
him
?
'
''
-LRB-
Mimicking
her
husband
,
she
threw
an
emphasis
on
the
word
*NL*
``
criminal
,
''
as
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
.
-RRB-
''
'
I
warned
you
of
the
results
*NL*
in
the
religious
,
the
civil
,
and
the
domestic
relation
.
You
have
not
*NL*
listened
to
me
.
Now
I
can
not
let
you
disgrace
my
name
,
--
'
''
``
and
my
son
,
''
*NL*
she
had
meant
to
say
,
but
about
her
son
she
could
not
jest
,
--
''
`
disgrace
*NL*
my
name
,
and
'
--
and
more
in
the
same
style
,
''
she
added
.
``
In
general
*NL*
terms
,
he
'll
say
in
his
official
manner
,
and
with
all
distinctness
and
*NL*
precision
,
that
he
can
not
let
me
go
,
but
will
take
all
measures
in
his
*NL*
power
to
prevent
scandal
.
And
he
will
calmly
and
punctually
act
in
*NL*
accordance
with
his
words
.
That
's
what
will
happen
.
He
's
not
a
man
,
but
*NL*
a
machine
,
and
a
spiteful
machine
when
he
's
angry
,
''
she
added
,
recalling
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
as
she
spoke
,
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
his
*NL*
figure
and
manner
of
speaking
,
and
reckoning
against
him
every
defect
*NL*
she
could
find
in
him
,
softening
nothing
for
the
great
wrong
she
herself
*NL*
was
doing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Anna
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
in
a
soft
and
persuasive
voice
,
trying
to
*NL*
soothe
her
,
``
we
absolutely
must
,
anyway
,
tell
him
,
and
then
be
guided
by
*NL*
the
line
he
takes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
run
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
not
run
away
?
I
do
n't
see
how
we
can
keep
on
like
this
.
And
not
*NL*
for
my
sake
--
I
see
that
you
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
run
away
,
and
become
your
mistress
,
''
she
said
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
''
he
said
,
with
reproachful
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
become
your
mistress
,
and
complete
the
ruin
of
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
would
have
said
``
my
son
,
''
but
she
could
not
utter
that
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
could
not
understand
how
she
,
with
her
strong
and
truthful
*NL*
nature
,
could
endure
this
state
of
deceit
,
and
not
long
to
get
out
of
*NL*
it
.
But
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
chief
cause
of
it
was
the
*NL*
word
--
_
son
_
,
which
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
pronounce
.
When
she
*NL*
thought
of
her
son
,
and
his
future
attitude
to
his
mother
,
who
had
*NL*
abandoned
his
father
,
she
felt
such
terror
at
what
she
had
done
,
that
*NL*
she
could
not
face
it
;
but
,
like
a
woman
,
could
only
try
to
comfort
*NL*
herself
with
lying
assurances
that
everything
would
remain
as
it
always
*NL*
had
been
,
and
that
it
was
possible
to
forget
the
fearful
question
of
how
*NL*
it
would
be
with
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
,
I
entreat
you
,
''
she
said
suddenly
,
taking
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
speaking
in
quite
a
different
tone
,
sincere
and
tender
,
``
never
speak
to
*NL*
me
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Anna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

Leave

I

all
the
baseness

all
the
horror
of
my

position
;
but
it
's
not
so
easy
to
arrange
as
you
think

And
leave
it
to

me

do
what
I

Never

Do

repeated

*NL*
``
I
do

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

she
interrupted
him
,
``
how
hard
it
is
for
your
truthful
nature

lie

I
grieve

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
thinking

he
said
;
``
how

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
unhappy

she
said
,
coming
closer
to
him
,
and
looking
at
him
with
an
*NL*
ecstatic
smile
of
love
.
``
I
am

cold

ashamed

No

*NL*
*NL*
She
could
hear
the
sound
of
her
son
's
voice
coming
towards
them
,
and
*NL*
glancing
swiftly
round
the
terrace
,
she
got
up
impulsively
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
glowed
with
the
fire
he
knew
so
well
;
with
a
rapid
movement
she
raised
*NL*
her
lovely
hands
,
covered
with
rings
,
took
his
head
,
looked
a
long
look
*NL*
into
his
face
,
and
,
putting
up
her
face
with
smiling
,
parted
lips
,
*NL*
swiftly
kissed
his
mouth
and
both
eyes
,
and
pushed
him
away
.
She
would
*NL*
have
gone
,
but
he
held
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
he
murmured
in
a
whisper
,
gazing
in
ecstasy
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tonight

at
one
o'clock

she
whispered
,
and
,
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
she
*NL*
walked
with
her
light
,
swift
step
to
meet
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
had
been
caught
by
the
rain
in
the
big
garden
,
and
he
and
his
*NL*
nurse
had
taken
shelter
in
an
arbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
_
au

she
said
to
Vronsky
.
``
I
must
soon
be
getting
ready
*NL*
for
the
races

Betsy
promised
to
fetch
me

*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
looking
at
his
watch
,
went
away
hurriedly
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Vronsky
looked
at
his
watch
on
the
Karenins
'
balcony
,
he
was
so
*NL*
greatly
agitated
and
lost
in
his
thoughts
that
he
saw
the
figures
on
the
*NL*
watch
's
face
,
but
could
not
take
in
what
time
it
was
.
He
came
out
on
to
*NL*
the
high
road
and
walked
,
picking
his
way
carefully
through
the
mud
,
to
*NL*
his
carriage
.
He
was
so
completely
absorbed
in
his
feeling
for
Anna
,
*NL*
that
he
did
not
even
think
what
o'clock
it
was
,
and
whether
he
had
time
*NL*
to
go
to
Bryansky
's
.
He
had
left
him
,
as
often
happens
,
only
the
*NL*
external
faculty
of
memory
,
that
points
out
each
step
one
has
to
take
,
*NL*
one
after
the
other
.
He
went
up
to
his
coachman
,
who
was
dozing
on
the
*NL*
box
in
the
shadow
,
already
lengthening
,
of
a
thick
limetree
;
he
admired
*NL*
the
shifting
clouds
of
midges
circling
over
the
hot
horses
,
and
,
waking
*NL*
the
coachman
,
he
jumped
into
the
carriage
,
and
told
him
to
drive
to
*NL*
Bryansky
's
.
It
was
only
after
driving
nearly
five
miles
that
he
had
*NL*
sufficiently
recovered
himself
to
look
at
his
watch
,
and
realize
that
it
*NL*
was
half-past
five
,
and
he
was
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
several
races
fixed
for
that
day
:
the
Mounted
Guards
'
race
,
*NL*
then
the
officers
'
mile-and-a-half
race
,
then
the
three-mile
race
,
and
*NL*
then
the
race
for
which
he
was
entered
.
He
could
still
be
in
time
for
*NL*
his
race
,
but
if
he
went
to
Bryansky
's
he
could
only
just
be
in
time
,
*NL*
and
he
would
arrive
when
the
whole
of
the
court
would
be
in
their
*NL*
places
.
That
would
be
a
pity
.
But
he
had
promised
Bryansky
to
come
,
and
*NL*
so
he
decided
to
drive
on
,
telling
the
coachman
not
to
spare
the
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
Bryansky
's
,
spent
five
minutes
there
,
and
galloped
back
.
This
*NL*
rapid
drive
calmed
him
.
All
that
was
painful
in
his
relations
with
Anna
,
*NL*
all
the
feeling
of
indefiniteness
left
by
their
conversation
,
had
*NL*
slipped
out
of
his
mind
.
He
was
thinking
now
with
pleasure
and
*NL*
excitement
of
the
race
,
of
his
being
anyhow
,
in
time
,
and
now
and
then
*NL*
the
thought
of
the
blissful
interview
awaiting
him
that
night
flashed
*NL*
across
his
imagination
like
a
flaming
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excitement
of
the
approaching
race
gained
upon
him
as
he
drove
*NL*
further
and
further
into
the
atmosphere
of
the
races
,
overtaking
*NL*
carriages
driving
up
from
the
summer
villas
or
out
of
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
quarters
no
one
was
left
at
home
;
all
were
at
the
races
,
and
his
*NL*
valet
was
looking
out
for
him
at
the
gate
.
While
he
was
changing
his
*NL*
clothes
,
his
valet
told
him
that
the
second
race
had
begun
already
,
that
*NL*
a
lot
of
gentlemen
had
been
to
ask
for
him
,
and
a
boy
had
twice
run
up
*NL*
from
the
stables
.
Dressing
without
hurry
-LRB-
he
never
hurried
himself
,
and
*NL*
never
lost
his
self-possession
-RRB-
,
Vronsky
drove
to
the
sheds
.
From
the
*NL*
sheds
he
could
see
a
perfect
sea
of
carriages
,
and
people
on
foot
,
*NL*
soldiers
surrounding
the
race
course
,
and
pavilions
swarming
with
*NL*
people
.
The
second
race
was
apparently
going
on
,
for
just
as
he
went
*NL*
into
the
sheds
he
heard
a
bell
ringing
.
Going
towards
the
stable
,
he
met
*NL*
the
white-legged
chestnut
,
Mahotin
's
Gladiator
,
being
led
to
the
*NL*
race-course
in
a
blue
forage
horsecloth
,
with
what
looked
like
huge
ears
*NL*
edged
with
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Cord
?
''
he
asked
the
stable-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
stable
,
putting
on
the
saddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
open
horse-box
stood
Frou-Frou
,
saddled
ready
.
They
were
just
*NL*
going
to
lead
her
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
too
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
All
right
!
''
said
the
Englishman
;
``
do
n't
upset
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
once
more
took
in
in
one
glance
the
exquisite
lines
of
his
*NL*
favorite
mare
;
who
was
quivering
all
over
,
and
with
an
effort
he
tore
*NL*
himself
from
the
sight
of
her
,
and
went
out
of
the
stable
.
He
went
*NL*
towards
the
pavilions
at
the
most
favorable
moment
for
escaping
*NL*
attention
.
The
mile-and-a-half
race
was
just
finishing
,
and
all
eyes
*NL*
were
fixed
on
the
horse-guard
in
front
and
the
light
hussar
behind
,
*NL*
urging
their
horses
on
with
a
last
effort
close
to
the
winning
post
.
*NL*
From
the
center
and
outside
of
the
ring
all
were
crowding
to
the
winning
*NL*
post
,
and
a
group
of
soldiers
and
officers
of
the
horse-guards
were
*NL*
shouting
loudly
their
delight
at
the
expected
triumph
of
their
officer
*NL*
and
comrade
.
Vronsky
moved
into
the
middle
of
the
crowd
unnoticed
,
*NL*
almost
at
the
very
moment
when
the
bell
rang
at
the
finish
of
the
race
,
*NL*
and
the
tall
,
mudspattered
horse-guard
who
came
in
first
,
bending
over
*NL*
the
saddle
,
let
go
the
reins
of
his
panting
gray
horse
that
looked
dark
*NL*
with
sweat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
,
stiffening
out
its
legs
,
with
an
effort
stopped
its
rapid
*NL*
course
,
and
the
officer
of
the
horse-guards
looked
round
him
like
a
man
*NL*
waking
up
from
a
heavy
sleep
,
and
just
managed
to
smile
.
A
crowd
of
*NL*
friends
and
outsiders
pressed
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
intentionally
avoided
that
select
crowd
of
the
upper
world
,
*NL*
which
was
moving
and
talking
with
discreet
freedom
before
the
pavilions
.
*NL*
He
knew
that
Madame
Karenina
was
there
,
and
Betsy
,
and
his
brother
's
*NL*
wife
,
and
he
purposely
did
not
go
near
them
for
fear
of
something
*NL*
distracting
his
attention
.
But
he
was
continually
met
and
stopped
by
*NL*
acquaintances
,
who
told
him
about
the
previous
races
,
and
kept
asking
*NL*
him
why
he
was
so
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
when
the
racers
had
to
go
to
the
pavilion
to
receive
the
*NL*
prizes
,
and
all
attention
was
directed
to
that
point
,
Vronsky
's
elder
*NL*
brother
,
Alexander
,
a
colonel
with
heavy
fringed
epaulets
,
came
up
to
*NL*
him
.
He
was
not
tall
,
though
as
broadly
built
as
Alexey
,
and
handsomer
*NL*
and
rosier
than
he
;
he
had
a
red
nose
,
and
an
open
,
drunken-looking
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
my
note
?
''
he
said
.
``
There
's
never
any
finding
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
Vronsky
,
in
spite
of
the
dissolute
life
,
and
in
especial
the
*NL*
drunken
habits
,
for
which
he
was
notorious
,
was
quite
one
of
the
court
*NL*
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
he
talked
to
his
brother
of
a
matter
bound
to
be
exceedingly
*NL*
disagreeable
to
him
,
knowing
that
the
eyes
of
many
people
might
be
fixed
*NL*
upon
him
,
he
kept
a
smiling
countenance
,
as
though
he
were
jesting
with
*NL*
his
brother
about
something
of
little
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
it
,
and
I
really
ca
n't
make
out
what
_
you
_
are
worrying
yourself
*NL*
about
,
''
said
Alexey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
worrying
myself
because
the
remark
has
just
been
made
to
me
that
*NL*
you
were
n't
here
,
and
that
you
were
seen
in
Peterhof
on
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
matters
which
only
concern
those
directly
interested
in
them
,
*NL*
and
the
matter
you
are
so
worried
about
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
if
so
,
you
may
as
well
cut
the
service
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
not
to
meddle
,
and
that
's
all
I
have
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Vronsky
's
frowning
face
turned
white
,
and
his
prominent
lower
jaw
*NL*
quivered
,
which
happened
rarely
with
him
.
Being
a
man
of
very
warm
*NL*
heart
,
he
was
seldom
angry
;
but
when
he
was
angry
,
and
when
his
chin
*NL*
quivered
,
then
,
as
Alexander
Vronsky
knew
,
he
was
dangerous
.
Alexander
*NL*
Vronsky
smiled
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wanted
to
give
you
Mother
's
letter
.
Answer
it
,
and
do
n't
worry
*NL*
about
anything
just
before
the
race
.
_
Bonne
chance
,
_
''
he
added
,
smiling
*NL*
and
he
moved
away
from
him
.
But
after
him
another
friendly
greeting
*NL*
brought
Vronsky
to
a
standstill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
wo
n't
recognize
your
friends
!
How
are
you
,
_
mon
cher
?
_
''
said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
conspicuously
brilliant
in
the
midst
of
all
the
*NL*
Petersburg
brilliance
as
he
was
in
Moscow
,
his
face
rosy
,
and
his
*NL*
whiskers
sleek
and
glossy
.
``
I
came
up
yesterday
,
and
I
'm
delighted
that
*NL*
I
shall
see
your
triumph
.
When
shall
we
meet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
tomorrow
to
the
messroom
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
and
squeezing
him
by
the
*NL*
sleeve
of
his
coat
,
with
apologies
,
he
moved
away
to
the
center
of
the
*NL*
race
course
,
where
the
horses
were
being
led
for
the
great
steeplechase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
who
had
run
in
the
last
race
were
being
led
home
,
steaming
*NL*
and
exhausted
,
by
the
stable-boys
,
and
one
after
another
the
fresh
*NL*
horses
for
the
coming
race
made
their
appearance
,
for
the
most
part
*NL*
English
racers
,
wearing
horsecloths
,
and
looking
with
their
drawn-up
*NL*
bellies
like
strange
,
huge
birds
.
On
the
right
was
led
in
Frou-Frou
,
*NL*
lean
and
beautiful
,
lifting
up
her
elastic
,
rather
long
pasterns
,
as
*NL*
though
moved
by
springs
.
Not
far
from
her
they
were
taking
the
rug
off
*NL*
the
lop-eared
Gladiator
.
The
strong
,
exquisite
,
perfectly
correct
lines
*NL*
of
the
stallion
,
with
his
superb
hind-quarters
and
excessively
short
*NL*
pasterns
almost
over
his
hoofs
,
attracted
Vronsky
's
attention
in
spite
*NL*
of
himself
.
He
would
have
gone
up
to
his
mare
,
but
he
was
again
detained
*NL*
by
an
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
's
Karenin
!
''
said
the
acquaintance
with
whom
he
was
chatting
.
*NL*
``
He
's
looking
for
his
wife
,
and
she
's
in
the
middle
of
the
pavilion
.
*NL*
Did
n't
you
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Vronsky
,
and
without
even
glancing
round
towards
the
*NL*
pavilion
where
his
friend
was
pointing
out
Madame
Karenina
,
he
went
up
*NL*
to
his
mare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
not
had
time
to
look
at
the
saddle
,
about
which
he
had
to
*NL*
give
some
direction
,
when
the
competitors
were
summoned
to
the
pavilion
*NL*
to
receive
their
numbers
and
places
in
the
row
at
starting
.
Seventeen
*NL*
officers
,
looking
serious
and
severe
,
many
with
pale
faces
,
met
together
*NL*
in
the
pavilion
and
drew
the
numbers
.
Vronsky
drew
the
number
seven
.
The
*NL*
cry
was
heard
:
``
Mount
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
with
the
others
riding
in
the
race
,
he
was
the
center
upon
*NL*
which
all
eyes
were
fastened
,
Vronsky
walked
up
to
his
mare
in
that
*NL*
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which
he
usually
became
deliberate
and
*NL*
composed
in
his
movements
.
Cord
,
in
honor
of
the
races
,
had
put
on
his
*NL*
best
clothes
,
a
black
coat
buttoned
up
,
a
stiffly
starched
collar
,
which
*NL*
propped
up
his
cheeks
,
a
round
black
hat
,
and
top
boots
.
He
was
calm
and
*NL*
dignified
as
ever
,
and
was
with
his
own
hands
holding
Frou-Frou
by
both
*NL*
reins
,
standing
straight
in
front
of
her
.
Frou-Frou
was
still
trembling
*NL*
as
though
in
a
fever
.
Her
eye
,
full
of
fire
,
glanced
sideways
at
*NL*
Vronsky
.
Vronsky
slipped
his
finger
under
the
saddle-girth
.
The
mare
*NL*
glanced
aslant
at
him
,
drew
up
her
lip
,
and
twitched
her
ear
.
The
*NL*
Englishman
puckered
up
his
lips
,
intending
to
indicate
a
smile
that
*NL*
anyone
should
verify
his
saddling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
;
you
wo
n't
feel
so
excited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
looked
round
for
the
last
time
at
his
rivals
.
He
knew
that
he
*NL*
would
not
see
them
during
the
race
.
Two
were
already
riding
forward
to
*NL*
the
point
from
which
they
were
to
start
.
Galtsin
,
a
friend
of
Vronsky
's
*NL*
and
one
of
his
more
formidable
rivals
,
was
moving
round
a
bay
horse
that
*NL*
would
not
let
him
mount
.
A
little
light
hussar
in
tight
riding
breeches
*NL*
rode
off
at
a
gallop
,
crouched
up
like
a
cat
on
the
saddle
,
in
imitation
*NL*
of
English
jockeys
.
Prince
Kuzovlev
sat
with
a
white
face
on
his
*NL*
thoroughbred
mare
from
the
Grabovsky
stud
,
while
an
English
groom
led
*NL*
her
by
the
bridle
.
Vronsky
and
all
his
comrades
knew
Kuzovlev
and
his
*NL*
peculiarity
of
``
weak
nerves
''
and
terrible
vanity
.
They
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
afraid
of
everything
,
afraid
of
riding
a
spirited
horse
.
But
now
,
just
*NL*
because
it
was
terrible
,
because
people
broke
their
necks
,
and
there
was
*NL*
a
doctor
standing
at
each
obstacle
,
and
an
ambulance
with
a
cross
on
it
,
*NL*
and
a
sister
of
mercy
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
part
in
the
race
.
*NL*
Their
eyes
met
,
and
Vronsky
gave
him
a
friendly
and
encouraging
nod
.
*NL*
Only
one
he
did
not
see
,
his
chief
rival
,
Mahotin
on
Gladiator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
,
''
said
Cord
to
Vronsky
,
``
and
remember
one
thing
:
*NL*
do
n't
hold
her
in
at
the
fences
,
and
do
n't
urge
her
on
;
let
her
go
as
*NL*
she
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
taking
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
can
,
lead
the
race
;
but
do
n't
lose
heart
till
the
last
minute
,
*NL*
even
if
you
're
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
mare
had
time
to
move
,
Vronsky
stepped
with
an
agile
,
*NL*
vigorous
movement
into
the
steel-toothed
stirrup
,
and
lightly
and
firmly
*NL*
seated
himself
on
the
creaking
leather
of
the
saddle
.
Getting
his
right
*NL*
foot
in
the
stirrup
,
he
smoothed
the
double
reins
,
as
he
always
did
,
*NL*
between
his
fingers
,
and
Cord
let
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
she
did
not
know
which
foot
to
put
first
,
Frou-Frou
started
,
*NL*
dragging
at
the
reins
with
her
long
neck
,
and
as
though
she
were
on
*NL*
springs
,
shaking
her
rider
from
side
to
side
.
Cord
quickened
his
step
,
*NL*
following
him
.
The
excited
mare
,
trying
to
shake
off
her
rider
first
on
*NL*
one
side
and
then
the
other
,
pulled
at
the
reins
,
and
Vronsky
tried
in
*NL*
vain
with
voice
and
hand
to
soothe
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
just
reaching
the
dammed-up
stream
on
their
way
to
the
*NL*
starting
point
.
Several
of
the
riders
were
in
front
and
several
behind
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
Vronsky
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
in
the
mud
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
he
was
overtaken
by
Mahotin
on
his
white-legged
,
*NL*
lop-eared
Gladiator
.
Mahotin
smiled
,
showing
his
long
teeth
,
but
Vronsky
*NL*
looked
angrily
at
him
.
He
did
not
like
him
,
and
regarded
him
now
as
his
*NL*
most
formidable
rival
.
He
was
angry
with
him
for
galloping
past
and
*NL*
exciting
his
mare
.
Frou-Frou
started
into
a
gallop
,
her
left
foot
*NL*
forward
,
made
two
bounds
,
and
fretting
at
the
tightened
reins
,
passed
*NL*
into
a
jolting
trot
,
bumping
her
rider
up
and
down
.
Cord
,
too
,
scowled
,
*NL*
and
followed
Vronsky
almost
at
a
trot
.

Chapter
25
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
seventeen
officers
in
all
riding
in
this
race
.
The
race
*NL*
course
was
a
large
three-mile
ring
of
the
form
of
an
ellipse
in
front
of
*NL*
the
pavilion
.
On
this
course
nine
obstacles
had
been
arranged
:
the
*NL*
stream
,
a
big
and
solid
barrier
five
feet
high
,
just
before
the
*NL*
pavilion
,
a
dry
ditch
,
a
ditch
full
of
water
,
a
precipitous
slope
,
an
*NL*
Irish
barricade
-LRB-
one
of
the
most
difficult
obstacles
,
consisting
of
a
*NL*
mound
fenced
with
brushwood
,
beyond
which
was
a
ditch
out
of
sight
for
*NL*
the
horses
,
so
that
the
horse
had
to
clear
both
obstacles
or
might
be
*NL*
killed
-RRB-
;
then
two
more
ditches
filled
with
water
,
and
one
dry
one
;
and
*NL*
the
end
of
the
race
was
just
facing
the
pavilion
.
But
the
race
began
not
*NL*
in
the
ring
,
but
two
hundred
yards
away
from
it
,
and
in
that
part
of
the
*NL*
course
was
the
first
obstacle
,
a
dammed-up
stream
,
seven
feet
in
*NL*
breadth
,
which
the
racers
could
leap
or
wade
through
as
they
preferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
times
they
were
ranged
ready
to
start
,
but
each
time
some
horse
*NL*
thrust
itself
out
of
line
,
and
they
had
to
begin
again
.
The
umpire
who
*NL*
was
starting
them
,
Colonel
Sestrin
,
was
beginning
to
lose
his
temper
,
*NL*
when
at
last
for
the
fourth
time
he
shouted
``
Away
!
''
and
the
racers
*NL*
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
eye
,
every
opera
glass
,
was
turned
on
the
brightly
colored
group
*NL*
of
riders
at
the
moment
they
were
in
line
to
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
off
!
They
're
starting
!
''
was
heard
on
all
sides
after
the
hush
*NL*
of
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
little
groups
and
solitary
figures
among
the
public
began
running
*NL*
from
place
to
place
to
get
a
better
view
.
In
the
very
first
minute
the
*NL*
close
group
of
horsemen
drew
out
,
and
it
could
be
seen
that
they
were
*NL*
approaching
the
stream
in
twos
and
threes
and
one
behind
another
.
To
the
*NL*
spectators
it
seemed
as
though
they
had
all
started
simultaneously
,
but
*NL*
to
the
racers
there
were
seconds
of
difference
that
had
great
value
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frou-Frou
,
excited
and
over-nervous
,
had
lost
the
first
moment
,
and
*NL*
several
horses
had
started
before
her
,
but
before
reaching
the
stream
,
*NL*
Vronsky
,
who
was
holding
in
the
mare
with
all
his
force
as
she
tugged
at
*NL*
the
bridle
,
easily
overtook
three
,
and
there
were
left
in
front
of
him
*NL*
Mahotin
's
chestnut
Gladiator
,
whose
hind-quarters
were
moving
lightly
*NL*
and
rhythmically
up
and
down
exactly
in
front
of
Vronsky
,
and
in
front
*NL*
of
all
,
the
dainty
mare
Diana
bearing
Kuzovlev
more
dead
than
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
instant
Vronsky
was
not
master
either
of
himself
or
his
*NL*
mare
.
Up
to
the
first
obstacle
,
the
stream
,
he
could
not
guide
the
*NL*
motions
of
his
mare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gladiator
and
Diana
came
up
to
it
together
and
almost
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
;
simultaneously
they
rose
above
the
stream
and
flew
across
to
*NL*
the
other
side
;
Frou-Frou
darted
after
them
,
as
if
flying
;
but
at
the
*NL*
very
moment
when
Vronsky
felt
himself
in
the
air
,
he
suddenly
saw
almost
*NL*
under
his
mare
's
hoofs
Kuzovlev
,
who
was
floundering
with
Diana
on
the
*NL*
further
side
of
the
stream
.
-LRB-
Kuzovlev
had
let
go
the
reins
as
he
took
*NL*
the
leap
,
and
the
mare
had
sent
him
flying
over
her
head
.
-RRB-
Those
details
*NL*
Vronsky
learned
later
;
at
the
moment
all
he
saw
was
that
just
under
him
,
*NL*
where
Frou-Frou
must
alight
,
Diana
's
legs
or
head
might
be
in
the
way
.
*NL*
But
Frou-Frou
drew
up
her
legs
and
back
in
the
very
act
of
leaping
,
like
*NL*
a
falling
cat
,
and
,
clearing
the
other
mare
,
alighted
beyond
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
the
darling
!
''
thought
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
crossing
the
stream
Vronsky
had
complete
control
of
his
mare
,
and
*NL*
began
holding
her
in
,
intending
to
cross
the
great
barrier
behind
*NL*
Mahotin
,
and
to
try
to
overtake
him
in
the
clear
ground
of
about
five
*NL*
hundred
yards
that
followed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
barrier
stood
just
in
front
of
the
imperial
pavilion
.
The
Tsar
*NL*
and
the
whole
court
and
crowds
of
people
were
all
gazing
at
them
--
at
*NL*
him
,
and
Mahotin
a
length
ahead
of
him
,
as
they
drew
near
the
``
devil
,
''
*NL*
as
the
solid
barrier
was
called
.
Vronsky
was
aware
of
those
eyes
*NL*
fastened
upon
him
from
all
sides
,
but
he
saw
nothing
except
the
ears
and
*NL*
neck
of
his
own
mare
,
the
ground
racing
to
meet
him
,
and
the
back
and
*NL*
white
legs
of
Gladiator
beating
time
swiftly
before
him
,
and
keeping
*NL*
always
the
same
distance
ahead
.
Gladiator
rose
,
with
no
sound
of
*NL*
knocking
against
anything
.
With
a
wave
of
his
short
tail
he
disappeared
*NL*
from
Vronsky
's
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
!
''
cried
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
,
under
Vronsky
's
eyes
,
right
before
him
flashed
the
*NL*
palings
of
the
barrier
.
Without
the
slightest
change
in
her
action
his
*NL*
mare
flew
over
it
;
the
palings
vanished
,
and
he
heard
only
a
crash
*NL*
behind
him
.
The
mare
,
excited
by
Gladiator
's
keeping
ahead
,
had
risen
*NL*
too
soon
before
the
barrier
,
and
grazed
it
with
her
hind
hoofs
.
But
her
*NL*
pace
never
changed
,
and
Vronsky
,
feeling
a
spatter
of
mud
in
his
face
,
*NL*
realized
that
he
was
once
more
the
same
distance
from
Gladiator
.
Once
*NL*
more
he
perceived
in
front
of
him
the
same
back
and
short
tail
,
and
*NL*
again
the
same
swiftly
moving
white
legs
that
got
no
further
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
moment
when
Vronsky
thought
that
now
was
the
time
to
*NL*
overtake
Mahotin
,
Frou-Frou
herself
,
understanding
his
thoughts
,
without
*NL*
any
incitement
on
his
part
,
gained
ground
considerably
,
and
began
*NL*
getting
alongside
of
Mahotin
on
the
most
favorable
side
,
close
to
the
*NL*
inner
cord
.
Mahotin
would
not
let
her
pass
that
side
.
Vronsky
had
hardly
*NL*
formed
the
thought
that
he
could
perhaps
pass
on
the
outer
side
,
when
*NL*
Frou-Frou
shifted
her
pace
and
began
overtaking
him
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
Frou-Frou
's
shoulder
,
beginning
by
now
to
be
dark
with
sweat
,
was
even
*NL*
with
Gladiator
's
back
.
For
a
few
lengths
they
moved
evenly
.
But
before
*NL*
the
obstacle
they
were
approaching
,
Vronsky
began
working
at
the
reins
,
*NL*
anxious
to
avoid
having
to
take
the
outer
circle
,
and
swiftly
passed
*NL*
Mahotin
just
upon
the
declivity
.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
mud-stained
*NL*
face
as
he
flashed
by
.
He
even
fancied
that
he
smiled
.
Vronsky
passed
*NL*
Mahotin
,
but
he
was
immediately
aware
of
him
close
upon
him
,
and
he
*NL*
never
ceased
hearing
the
even-thudding
hoofs
and
the
rapid
and
still
*NL*
quite
fresh
breathing
of
Gladiator
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
two
obstacles
,
the
water
course
and
the
barrier
,
were
easily
*NL*
crossed
,
but
Vronsky
began
to
hear
the
snorting
and
thud
of
Gladiator
*NL*
closer
upon
him
.
He
urged
on
his
mare
,
and
to
his
delight
felt
that
she
*NL*
easily
quickened
her
pace
,
and
the
thud
of
Gladiator
's
hoofs
was
again
*NL*
heard
at
the
same
distance
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
at
the
head
of
the
race
,
just
as
he
wanted
to
be
and
as
Cord
*NL*
had
advised
,
and
now
he
felt
sure
of
being
the
winner
.
His
excitement
,
*NL*
his
delight
,
and
his
tenderness
for
Frou-Frou
grew
keener
and
keener
.
He
*NL*
longed
to
look
round
again
,
but
he
did
not
dare
do
this
,
and
tried
to
be
*NL*
cool
and
not
to
urge
on
his
mare
so
to
keep
the
same
reserve
of
force
in
*NL*
her
as
he
felt
that
Gladiator
still
kept
.
There
remained
only
one
*NL*
obstacle
,
the
most
difficult
;
if
he
could
cross
it
ahead
of
the
others
*NL*
he
would
come
in
first
.
He
was
flying
towards
the
Irish
barricade
,
*NL*
Frou-Frou
and
he
both
together
saw
the
barricade
in
the
distance
,
and
*NL*
both
the
man
and
the
mare
had
a
moment
's
hesitation
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
uncertainty
in
the
mare
's
ears
and
lifted
the
whip
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
felt
that
his
fears
were
groundless
;
the
mare
knew
what
was
wanted
.
She
*NL*
quickened
her
pace
and
rose
smoothly
,
just
as
he
had
fancied
she
would
,
*NL*
and
as
she
left
the
ground
gave
herself
up
to
the
force
of
her
rush
,
*NL*
which
carried
her
far
beyond
the
ditch
;
and
with
the
same
rhythm
,
*NL*
without
effort
,
with
the
same
leg
forward
,
Frou-Frou
fell
back
into
her
*NL*
pace
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
,
Vronsky
!
''
he
heard
shouts
from
a
knot
of
men
--
he
knew
they
were
*NL*
his
friends
in
the
regiment
--
who
were
standing
at
the
obstacle
.
He
could
*NL*
not
fail
to
recognize
Yashvin
's
voice
though
he
did
not
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
my
sweet
!
''
he
said
inwardly
to
Frou-Frou
,
as
he
listened
for
what
was
*NL*
happening
behind
.
``
He
's
cleared
it
!
''
he
thought
,
catching
the
thud
of
*NL*
Gladiator
's
hoofs
behind
him
.
There
remained
only
the
last
ditch
,
filled
*NL*
with
water
and
five
feet
wide
.
Vronsky
did
not
even
look
at
it
,
but
*NL*
anxious
to
get
in
a
long
way
first
began
sawing
away
at
the
reins
,
*NL*
lifting
the
mare
's
head
and
letting
it
go
in
time
with
her
paces
.
He
*NL*
felt
that
the
mare
was
at
her
very
last
reserve
of
strength
;
not
her
*NL*
neck
and
shoulders
merely
were
wet
,
but
the
sweat
was
standing
in
drops
*NL*
on
her
mane
,
her
head
,
her
sharp
ears
,
and
her
breath
came
in
short
,
*NL*
sharp
gasps
.
But
he
knew
that
she
had
strength
left
more
than
enough
for
*NL*
the
remaining
five
hundred
yards
.
It
was
only
from
feeling
himself
*NL*
nearer
the
ground
and
from
the
peculiar
smoothness
of
his
motion
that
*NL*
Vronsky
knew
how
greatly
the
mare
had
quickened
her
pace
.
She
flew
over
*NL*
the
ditch
as
though
not
noticing
it
.
She
flew
over
it
like
a
bird
;
but
*NL*
at
the
same
instant
Vronsky
,
to
his
horror
,
felt
that
he
had
failed
to
*NL*
keep
up
with
the
mare
's
pace
,
that
he
had
,
he
did
not
know
how
,
made
a
*NL*
fearful
,
unpardonable
mistake
,
in
recovering
his
seat
in
the
saddle
.
All
*NL*
at
once
his
position
had
shifted
and
he
knew
that
something
awful
had
*NL*
happened
.
He
could
not
yet
make
out
what
had
happened
,
when
the
white
*NL*
legs
of
a
chestnut
horse
flashed
by
close
to
him
,
and
Mahotin
passed
at
*NL*
a
swift
gallop
.
Vronsky
was
touching
the
ground
with
one
foot
,
and
his
*NL*
mare
was
sinking
on
that
foot
.
He
just
had
time
to
free
his
leg
when
she
*NL*
fell
on
one
side
,
gasping
painfully
,
and
,
making
vain
efforts
to
rise
*NL*
with
her
delicate
,
soaking
neck
,
she
fluttered
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
*NL*
like
a
shot
bird
.
The
clumsy
movement
made
by
Vronsky
had
broken
her
*NL*
back
.
But
that
he
only
knew
much
later
.
At
that
moment
he
knew
only
that
*NL*
Mahotin
had
flown
swiftly
by
,
while
he
stood
staggering
alone
on
the
*NL*
muddy
,
motionless
ground
,
and
Frou-Frou
lay
gasping
before
him
,
bending
*NL*
her
head
back
and
gazing
at
him
with
her
exquisite
eyes
.
Still
unable
to
*NL*
realize
what
had
happened
,
Vronsky
tugged
at
his
mare
's
reins
.
Again
she
*NL*
struggled
all
over
like
a
fish
,
and
her
shoulders
setting
the
saddle
*NL*
heaving
,
she
rose
on
her
front
legs
but
unable
to
lift
her
back
,
she
*NL*
quivered
all
over
and
again
fell
on
her
side
.
With
a
face
hideous
with
*NL*
passion
,
his
lower
jaw
trembling
,
and
his
cheeks
white
,
Vronsky
kicked
*NL*
her
with
his
heel
in
the
stomach
and
again
fell
to
tugging
at
the
rein
.
*NL*
She
did
not
stir
,
but
thrusting
her
nose
into
the
ground
,
she
simply
*NL*
gazed
at
her
master
with
her
speaking
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
--
a
--
a
!
''
groaned
Vronsky
,
clutching
at
his
head
.
``
Ah
!
what
have
I
*NL*
done
!
''
he
cried
.
``
The
race
lost
!
And
my
fault
!
shameful
,
unpardonable
!
*NL*
And
the
poor
darling
,
ruined
mare
!
Ah
!
what
have
I
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
crowd
of
men
,
a
doctor
and
his
assistant
,
the
officers
of
his
*NL*
regiment
,
ran
up
to
him
.
To
his
misery
he
felt
that
he
was
whole
and
*NL*
unhurt
.
The
mare
had
broken
her
back
,
and
it
was
decided
to
shoot
her
.
*NL*
Vronsky
could
not
answer
questions
,
could
not
speak
to
anyone
.
He
*NL*
turned
,
and
without
picking
up
his
cap
that
had
fallen
off
,
walked
away
*NL*
from
the
race
course
,
not
knowing
where
he
was
going
.
He
felt
utterly
*NL*
wretched
.
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
the
bitterest
sort
of
*NL*
misfortune
,
misfortune
beyond
remedy
,
and
caused
by
his
own
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yashvin
overtook
him
with
his
cap
,
and
led
him
home
,
and
half
an
hour
*NL*
later
Vronsky
had
regained
his
self-possession
.
But
the
memory
of
that
*NL*
race
remained
for
long
in
his
heart
,
the
cruelest
and
bitterest
memory
*NL*
of
his
life
.

Chapter
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
external
relations
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
his
wife
had
*NL*
remained
unchanged
.
The
sole
difference
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
more
*NL*
busily
occupied
than
ever
.
As
in
former
years
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
spring
he
had
gone
to
a
foreign
watering-place
for
the
sake
of
his
*NL*
health
,
deranged
by
the
winter
's
work
that
every
year
grew
heavier
.
And
*NL*
just
as
always
he
returned
in
July
and
at
once
fell
to
work
as
usual
*NL*
with
increased
energy
.
As
usual
,
too
,
his
wife
had
moved
for
the
summer
*NL*
to
a
villa
out
of
town
,
while
he
remained
in
Petersburg
.
From
the
date
*NL*
of
their
conversation
after
the
party
at
Princess
Tverskaya
's
he
had
*NL*
never
spoken
again
to
Anna
of
his
suspicions
and
his
jealousies
,
and
*NL*
that
habitual
tone
of
his
bantering
mimicry
was
the
most
convenient
tone
*NL*
possible
for
his
present
attitude
to
his
wife
.
He
was
a
little
colder
to
*NL*
his
wife
.
He
simply
seemed
to
be
slightly
displeased
with
her
for
that
*NL*
first
midnight
conversation
,
which
she
had
repelled
.
In
his
attitude
to
*NL*
her
there
was
a
shade
of
vexation
,
but
nothing
more
.
``
You
would
not
be
*NL*
open
with
me
,
''
he
seemed
to
say
,
mentally
addressing
her
;
``
so
much
the
*NL*
worse
for
you
.
Now
you
may
beg
as
you
please
,
but
I
wo
n't
be
open
with
*NL*
you
.
So
much
the
worse
for
you
!
''
he
said
mentally
,
like
a
man
who
,
after
*NL*
vainly
attempting
to
extinguish
a
fire
,
should
fly
in
a
rage
with
his
*NL*
vain
efforts
and
say
,
``
Oh
,
very
well
then
!
you
shall
burn
for
this
!
''
*NL*
This
man
,
so
subtle
and
astute
in
official
life
,
did
not
realize
all
the
*NL*
senselessness
of
such
an
attitude
to
his
wife
.
He
did
not
realize
it
,
*NL*
because
it
was
too
terrible
to
him
to
realize
his
actual
position
,
and
*NL*
he
shut
down
and
locked
and
sealed
up
in
his
heart
that
secret
place
*NL*
where
lay
hid
his
feelings
towards
his
family
,
that
is
,
his
wife
and
*NL*
son
.
He
who
had
been
such
a
careful
father
,
had
from
the
end
of
that
*NL*
winter
become
peculiarly
frigid
to
his
son
,
and
adopted
to
him
just
the
*NL*
same
bantering
tone
he
used
with
his
wife
.
``
Aha
,
young
man
!
''
was
the
*NL*
greeting
with
which
he
met
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
asserted
and
believed
that
he
had
never
in
any
*NL*
previous
year
had
so
much
official
business
as
that
year
.
But
he
was
not
*NL*
aware
that
he
sought
work
for
himself
that
year
,
that
this
was
one
of
*NL*
the
means
for
keeping
shut
that
secret
place
where
lay
hid
his
feelings
*NL*
towards
his
wife
and
son
and
his
thoughts
about
them
,
which
became
more
*NL*
terrible
the
longer
they
lay
there
.
If
anyone
had
had
the
right
to
ask
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
what
he
thought
of
his
wife
's
behavior
,
the
mild
*NL*
and
peaceable
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
would
have
made
no
answer
,
but
he
*NL*
would
have
been
greatly
angered
with
any
man
who
should
question
him
on
*NL*
that
subject
.
For
this
reason
there
positively
came
into
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
face
a
look
of
haughtiness
and
severity
whenever
anyone
*NL*
inquired
after
his
wife
's
health
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
want
to
*NL*
think
at
all
about
his
wife
's
behavior
,
and
he
actually
succeeded
in
not
*NL*
thinking
about
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
permanent
summer
villa
was
in
Peterhof
,
and
the
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
used
as
a
rule
to
spend
the
summer
there
,
close
*NL*
to
Anna
,
and
constantly
seeing
her
.
That
year
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
*NL*
declined
to
settle
in
Peterhof
,
was
not
once
at
Anna
Arkadyevna
's
,
and
*NL*
in
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
hinted
at
the
unsuitability
*NL*
of
Anna
's
close
intimacy
with
Betsy
and
Vronsky
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
sternly
cut
her
short
,
roundly
declaring
his
wife
to
be
above
suspicion
,
*NL*
and
from
that
time
began
to
avoid
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
He
did
not
*NL*
want
to
see
,
and
did
not
see
,
that
many
people
in
society
cast
dubious
*NL*
glances
on
his
wife
;
he
did
not
want
to
understand
,
and
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
why
his
wife
had
so
particularly
insisted
on
staying
at
*NL*
Tsarskoe
,
where
Betsy
was
staying
,
and
not
far
from
the
camp
of
*NL*
Vronsky
's
regiment
.
He
did
not
allow
himself
to
think
about
it
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
think
about
it
;
but
all
the
same
though
he
never
admitted
it
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
had
no
proofs
,
not
even
suspicious
evidence
,
in
the
bottom
*NL*
of
his
heart
he
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
he
was
a
deceived
husband
,
*NL*
and
he
was
profoundly
miserable
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
during
those
eight
years
of
happy
life
with
his
wife
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
looked
at
other
men
's
faithless
wives
and
other
*NL*
deceived
husbands
and
asked
himself
:
``
How
can
people
descend
to
that
?
*NL*
how
is
it
they
do
n't
put
an
end
to
such
a
hideous
position
?
''
But
now
,
*NL*
when
the
misfortune
had
come
upon
himself
,
he
was
so
far
from
thinking
*NL*
of
putting
an
end
to
the
position
that
he
would
not
recognize
it
at
all
,
*NL*
would
not
recognize
it
just
because
it
was
too
awful
,
too
unnatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
his
return
from
abroad
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
twice
been
at
*NL*
their
country
villa
.
Once
he
dined
there
,
another
time
he
spent
the
*NL*
evening
there
with
a
party
of
friends
,
but
he
had
not
once
stayed
the
*NL*
night
there
,
as
it
had
been
his
habit
to
do
in
previous
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
of
the
races
had
been
a
very
busy
day
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
*NL*
but
when
mentally
sketching
out
the
day
in
the
morning
,
he
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
go
to
their
country
house
to
see
his
wife
immediately
after
*NL*
dinner
,
and
from
there
to
the
races
,
which
all
the
Court
were
to
*NL*
witness
,
and
at
which
he
was
bound
to
be
present
.
He
was
going
to
see
*NL*
his
wife
,
because
he
had
determined
to
see
her
once
a
week
to
keep
up
*NL*
appearances
.
And
besides
,
on
that
day
,
as
it
was
the
fifteenth
,
he
had
*NL*
to
give
his
wife
some
money
for
her
expenses
,
according
to
their
usual
*NL*
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
habitual
control
over
his
thoughts
,
though
he
thought
all
this
*NL*
about
his
wife
,
he
did
not
let
his
thoughts
stray
further
in
regard
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
was
a
very
full
one
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
The
evening
*NL*
before
,
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
sent
him
a
pamphlet
by
a
celebrated
*NL*
traveler
in
China
,
who
was
staying
in
Petersburg
,
and
with
it
she
*NL*
enclosed
a
note
begging
him
to
see
the
traveler
himself
,
as
he
was
an
*NL*
extremely
interesting
person
from
various
points
of
view
,
and
likely
to
*NL*
be
useful
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
not
had
time
to
read
the
pamphlet
*NL*
through
in
the
evening
,
and
finished
it
in
the
morning
.
Then
people
*NL*
began
arriving
with
petitions
,
and
there
came
the
reports
,
interviews
,
*NL*
appointments
,
dismissals
,
apportionment
of
rewards
,
pensions
,
grants
,
*NL*
notes
,
the
workaday
round
,
as
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
called
it
,
that
*NL*
always
took
up
so
much
time
.
Then
there
was
private
business
of
his
own
,
*NL*
a
visit
from
the
doctor
and
the
steward
who
managed
his
property
.
The
*NL*
steward
did
not
take
up
much
time
.
He
simply
gave
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
the
money
he
needed
together
with
a
brief
statement
of
the
position
of
*NL*
his
affairs
,
which
was
not
altogether
satisfactory
,
as
it
had
happened
*NL*
that
during
that
year
,
owing
to
increased
expenses
,
more
had
been
paid
*NL*
out
than
usual
,
and
there
was
a
deficit
.
But
the
doctor
,
a
celebrated
*NL*
Petersburg
doctor
,
who
was
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
*NL*
not
expected
him
that
day
,
and
was
surprised
at
his
visit
,
and
still
*NL*
more
so
when
the
doctor
questioned
him
very
carefully
about
his
health
,
*NL*
listened
to
his
breathing
,
and
tapped
at
his
liver
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
did
not
know
that
his
friend
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
noticing
*NL*
that
he
was
not
as
well
as
usual
that
year
,
had
begged
the
doctor
to
go
*NL*
and
examine
him
.
``
Do
this
for
my
sake
,
''
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
*NL*
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
it
for
the
sake
of
Russia
,
countess
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
priceless
man
!
''
said
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
extremely
dissatisfied
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
He
*NL*
found
the
liver
considerably
enlarged
,
and
the
digestive
powers
*NL*
weakened
,
while
the
course
of
mineral
waters
had
been
quite
without
*NL*
effect
.
He
prescribed
more
physical
exercise
as
far
as
possible
,
and
as
*NL*
far
as
possible
less
mental
strain
,
and
above
all
no
worry
--
in
other
*NL*
words
,
just
what
was
as
much
out
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
power
as
*NL*
abstaining
from
breathing
.
Then
he
withdrew
,
leaving
in
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
an
unpleasant
sense
that
something
was
wrong
with
him
,
*NL*
and
that
there
was
no
chance
of
curing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
coming
away
,
the
doctor
chanced
to
meet
on
the
staircase
an
*NL*
acquaintance
of
his
,
Sludin
,
who
was
secretary
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
department
.
They
had
been
comrades
at
the
university
,
*NL*
and
though
they
rarely
met
,
they
thought
highly
of
each
other
and
were
*NL*
excellent
friends
,
and
so
there
was
no
one
to
whom
the
doctor
would
have
*NL*
given
his
opinion
of
a
patient
so
freely
as
to
Sludin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
've
been
seeing
him
!
''
said
Sludin
.
``
He
's
not
well
,
and
*NL*
I
fancy
...
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
beckoning
over
Sludin
's
head
to
his
*NL*
coachman
to
bring
the
carriage
round
.
``
It
's
just
this
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
*NL*
taking
a
finger
of
his
kid
glove
in
his
white
hands
and
pulling
it
,
``
if
*NL*
you
do
n't
strain
the
strings
,
and
then
try
to
break
them
,
you
'll
find
it
*NL*
a
difficult
job
;
but
strain
a
string
to
its
very
utmost
,
and
the
mere
*NL*
weight
of
one
finger
on
the
strained
string
will
snap
it
.
And
with
his
*NL*
close
assiduity
,
his
conscientious
devotion
to
his
work
,
he
's
strained
*NL*
to
the
utmost
;
and
there
's
some
outside
burden
weighing
on
him
,
and
not
*NL*
a
light
one
,
''
concluded
the
doctor
,
raising
his
eyebrows
significantly
.
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
at
the
races
?
''
he
added
,
as
he
sank
into
his
seat
in
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
to
be
sure
;
it
does
waste
a
lot
of
time
,
''
the
doctor
*NL*
responded
vaguely
to
some
reply
of
Sludin
's
he
had
not
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
after
the
doctor
,
who
had
taken
up
so
much
time
,
came
the
*NL*
celebrated
traveler
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
by
means
of
the
pamphlet
*NL*
he
had
only
just
finished
reading
and
his
previous
acquaintance
with
the
*NL*
subject
,
impressed
the
traveler
by
the
depth
of
his
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
subject
and
the
breadth
and
enlightenment
of
his
view
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
as
the
traveler
there
was
announced
a
provincial
*NL*
marshal
of
nobility
on
a
visit
to
Petersburg
,
with
whom
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
to
have
some
conversation
.
After
his
departure
,
he
*NL*
had
to
finish
the
daily
routine
of
business
with
his
secretary
,
and
then
*NL*
he
still
had
to
drive
round
to
call
on
a
certain
great
personage
on
a
*NL*
matter
of
grave
and
serious
import
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
only
just
*NL*
managed
to
be
back
by
five
o'clock
,
his
dinner-hour
,
and
after
dining
*NL*
with
his
secretary
,
he
invited
him
to
drive
with
him
to
his
country
*NL*
villa
and
to
the
races
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
did
not
acknowledge
it
to
himself
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
always
tried
nowadays
to
secure
the
presence
of
a
third
person
in
his
*NL*
interviews
with
his
wife
.

Anna
was
upstairs

standing
before

and
,
with
*NL*
Annushka
's
assistance
,
pinning
the
last
ribbon
on
her
gown
when
she
*NL*
heard
carriage
wheels
crunching
the
gravel
at
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
early
for
Betsy
,
''
she
thought
,
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
*NL*
she
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
and
the
black
hat
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
and
the
ears
that
she
knew
so
well
sticking
up
each
side
*NL*
of
it
.
``
How
unlucky
!
Can
he
be
going
to
stay
the
night
?
''
she
wondered
,
*NL*
and
the
thought
of
all
that
might
come
of
such
a
chance
struck
her
as
so
*NL*
awful
and
terrible
that
,
without
dwelling
on
it
for
a
moment
,
she
went
*NL*
down
to
meet
him
with
a
bright
and
radiant
face
;
and
conscious
of
the
*NL*
presence
of
that
spirit
of
falsehood
and
deceit
in
herself
that
she
had
*NL*
come
to
know
of
late
,
she
abandoned
herself
to
that
spirit
and
began
*NL*
talking
,
hardly
knowing
what
she
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
nice
of
you
!
''
she
said
,
giving
her
husband
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
greeting
Sludin
,
who
was
like
one
of
the
family
,
with
a
smile
.
``
You
're
*NL*
staying
the
night
,
I
hope
?
''
was
the
first
word
the
spirit
of
falsehood
*NL*
prompted
her
to
utter
;
``
and
now
we
'll
go
together
.
Only
it
's
a
pity
I
've
*NL*
promised
Betsy
.
She
's
coming
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
knit
his
brows
at
Betsy
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
going
to
separate
the
inseparables
,
''
he
said
in
his
usual
*NL*
bantering
tone
.
``
I
'm
going
with
Mihail
Vassilievitch
.
I
'm
ordered
*NL*
exercise
by
the
doctors
too
.
I
'll
walk
,
and
fancy
myself
at
the
springs
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
hurry
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
Would
you
like
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
in
tea
,
and
tell
Seryozha
that
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
is
here
.
*NL*
Well
,
tell
me
,
how
have
you
been
?
Mihail
Vassilievitch
,
you
've
not
been
*NL*
to
see
me
before
.
Look
how
lovely
it
is
out
on
the
terrace
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
turning
first
to
one
and
then
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
very
simply
and
naturally
,
but
too
much
and
too
fast
.
She
was
*NL*
the
more
aware
of
this
from
noticing
in
the
inquisitive
look
Mihail
*NL*
Vassilievitch
turned
on
her
that
he
was
,
as
it
were
,
keeping
watch
on
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mihail
Vassilievitch
promptly
went
out
on
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
beside
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
quite
well
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
the
doctor
's
been
with
me
today
and
wasted
an
hour
of
*NL*
my
time
.
I
feel
that
some
one
of
our
friends
must
have
sent
him
:
my
*NL*
health
's
so
precious
,
it
seems
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
what
did
he
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
questioned
him
about
his
health
and
what
he
had
been
doing
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
persuade
him
to
take
a
rest
and
come
out
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
she
said
brightly
,
rapidly
,
and
with
a
peculiar
brilliance
in
*NL*
her
eyes
.
But
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
now
attach
any
special
*NL*
significance
to
this
tone
of
hers
.
He
heard
only
her
words
and
gave
them
*NL*
only
the
direct
sense
they
bore
.
And
he
answered
simply
,
though
*NL*
jestingly
.
There
was
nothing
remarkable
in
all
this
conversation
,
but
*NL*
never
after
could
Anna
recall
this
brief
scene
without
an
agonizing
pang
*NL*
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
came
in
preceded
by
his
governess
.
If
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
*NL*
allowed
himself
to
observe
he
would
have
noticed
the
timid
and
*NL*
bewildered
eyes
with
which
Seryozha
glanced
first
at
his
father
and
then
*NL*
at
his
mother
.
But
he
would
not
see
anything
,
and
he
did
not
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
young
man
!
He
's
grown
.
Really
,
he
's
getting
quite
a
man
.
How
*NL*
are
you
,
young
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
gave
his
hand
to
the
scared
child
.
Seryozha
had
been
shy
of
his
*NL*
father
before
,
and
now
,
ever
since
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
taken
to
*NL*
calling
him
young
man
,
and
since
that
insoluble
question
had
occurred
to
*NL*
him
whether
Vronsky
were
a
friend
or
a
foe
,
he
avoided
his
father
.
He
*NL*
looked
round
towards
his
mother
as
though
seeking
shelter
.
It
was
only
*NL*
with
his
mother
that
he
was
at
ease
.
Meanwhile
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
was
holding
his
son
by
the
shoulder
while
he
was
speaking
to
the
*NL*
governess
,
and
Seryozha
was
so
miserably
uncomfortable
that
Anna
saw
he
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
who
had
flushed
a
little
the
instant
her
son
came
in
,
noticing
*NL*
that
Seryozha
was
uncomfortable
,
got
up
hurriedly
,
took
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
hand
from
her
son
's
shoulder
,
and
kissing
the
boy
,
led
*NL*
him
out
onto
the
terrace
,
and
quickly
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
to
start
,
though
,
''
said
she
,
glancing
at
her
watch
.
``
How
is
*NL*
it
Betsy
does
n't
come
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
getting
up
,
he
folded
his
hands
*NL*
and
cracked
his
fingers
.
``
I
've
come
to
bring
you
some
money
,
too
,
for
*NL*
nightingales
,
we
know
,
ca
n't
live
on
fairy
tales
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
want
*NL*
it
,
I
expect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
...
yes
,
I
do
,
''
she
said
,
not
looking
at
him
,
and
*NL*
crimsoning
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
.
``
But
you
'll
come
back
here
after
*NL*
the
races
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
answered
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
And
here
's
the
glory
of
*NL*
Peterhof
,
Princess
Tverskaya
,
''
he
added
,
looking
out
of
the
window
at
*NL*
the
elegant
English
carriage
with
the
tiny
seats
placed
extremely
high
.
*NL*
``
What
elegance
!
Charming
!
Well
,
let
us
be
starting
too
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Tverskaya
did
not
get
out
of
her
carriage
,
but
her
groom
,
in
*NL*
high
boots
,
a
cape
,
and
black
hat
,
darted
out
at
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
;
good-bye
!
''
said
Anna
,
and
kissing
her
son
,
she
went
up
to
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
held
out
her
hand
to
him
.
``
It
was
ever
so
nice
*NL*
of
you
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
kissed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
_
au
revoir
_
,
then
!
You
'll
come
back
for
some
tea
;
that
's
*NL*
delightful
!
''
she
said
,
and
went
out
,
gay
and
radiant
.
But
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
no
longer
saw
him
,
she
was
aware
of
the
spot
on
her
hand
that
his
lips
*NL*
had
touched
,
and
she
shuddered
with
repulsion
.

Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
reached
the
race-course
,
Anna
was
already
*NL*
sitting
in
the
pavilion
beside
Betsy
,
in
that
pavilion
where
all
the
*NL*
highest
society
had
gathered
.
She
caught
sight
of
her
husband
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
Two
men
,
her
husband
and
her
lover
,
were
the
two
centers
of
*NL*
her
existence
,
and
unaided
by
her
external
senses
she
was
aware
of
their
*NL*
nearness
.
She
was
aware
of
her
husband
approaching
a
long
way
off
,
and
*NL*
she
could
not
help
following
him
in
the
surging
crowd
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
which
he
was
moving
.
She
watched
his
progress
towards
the
pavilion
,
saw
*NL*
him
now
responding
condescendingly
to
an
ingratiating
bow
,
now
*NL*
exchanging
friendly
,
nonchalant
greetings
with
his
equals
,
now
*NL*
assiduously
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
some
great
one
of
this
world
,
and
*NL*
taking
off
his
big
round
hat
that
squeezed
the
tips
of
his
ears
.
All
*NL*
these
ways
of
his
she
knew
,
and
all
were
hateful
to
her
.
``
Nothing
but
*NL*
ambition
,
nothing
but
the
desire
to
get
on
,
that
's
all
there
is
in
his
*NL*
soul
,
''
she
thought
;
``
as
for
these
lofty
ideals
,
love
of
culture
,
*NL*
religion
,
they
are
only
so
many
tools
for
getting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
glances
towards
the
ladies
'
pavilion
-LRB-
he
was
staring
straight
*NL*
at
her
,
but
did
not
distinguish
his
wife
in
the
sea
of
muslin
,
ribbons
,
*NL*
feathers
,
parasols
and
flowers
-RRB-
she
saw
that
he
was
looking
for
her
,
but
*NL*
she
purposely
avoided
noticing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
''
Princess
Betsy
called
to
him
;
``
I
'm
sure
you
*NL*
do
n't
see
your
wife
:
here
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
his
chilly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
so
much
splendor
here
that
one
's
eyes
are
dazzled
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
and
he
went
into
the
pavilion
.
He
smiled
to
his
wife
as
a
man
should
*NL*
smile
on
meeting
his
wife
after
only
just
parting
from
her
,
and
greeted
*NL*
the
princess
and
other
acquaintances
,
giving
to
each
what
was
due
--
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
jesting
with
the
ladies
and
dealing
out
friendly
greetings
*NL*
among
the
men
.
Below
,
near
the
pavilion
,
was
standing
an
*NL*
adjutant-general
of
whom
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
a
high
opinion
,
noted
*NL*
for
his
intelligence
and
culture
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
entered
into
*NL*
conversation
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
interval
between
the
races
,
and
so
nothing
hindered
*NL*
conversation
.
The
adjutant-general
expressed
his
disapproval
of
races
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
replied
defending
them
.
Anna
heard
his
high
,
*NL*
measured
tones
,
not
losing
one
word
,
and
every
word
struck
her
as
false
,
*NL*
and
stabbed
her
ears
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
three-mile
steeplechase
was
beginning
,
she
bent
forward
and
*NL*
gazed
with
fixed
eyes
at
Vronsky
as
he
went
up
to
his
horse
and
mounted
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
she
heard
that
loathsome
,
never-ceasing
voice
of
*NL*
her
husband
.
She
was
in
an
agony
of
terror
for
Vronsky
,
but
a
still
*NL*
greater
agony
was
the
never-ceasing
,
as
it
seemed
to
her
,
stream
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
shrill
voice
with
its
familiar
intonations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
wicked
woman
,
a
lost
woman
,
''
she
thought
;
``
but
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
lying
,
I
ca
n't
endure
falsehood
,
while
as
for
_
him
_
-LRB-
her
husband
-RRB-
it
's
*NL*
the
breath
of
his
life
--
falsehood
.
He
knows
all
about
it
,
he
sees
it
*NL*
all
;
what
does
he
care
if
he
can
talk
so
calmly
?
If
he
were
to
kill
me
,
*NL*
if
he
were
to
kill
Vronsky
,
I
might
respect
him
.
No
,
all
he
wants
is
*NL*
falsehood
and
propriety
,
''
Anna
said
to
herself
,
not
considering
exactly
*NL*
what
it
was
she
wanted
of
her
husband
,
and
how
she
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
see
him
behave
.
She
did
not
understand
either
that
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
peculiar
loquacity
that
day
,
so
exasperating
to
her
,
*NL*
was
merely
the
expression
of
his
inward
distress
and
uneasiness
.
As
a
*NL*
child
that
has
been
hurt
skips
about
,
putting
all
his
muscles
into
*NL*
movement
to
drown
the
pain
,
in
the
same
way
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
needed
*NL*
mental
exercise
to
drown
the
thoughts
of
his
wife
that
in
her
presence
*NL*
and
in
Vronsky
's
,
and
with
the
continual
iteration
of
his
name
,
would
*NL*
force
themselves
on
his
attention
.
And
it
was
as
natural
for
him
to
talk
*NL*
well
and
cleverly
,
as
it
is
natural
for
a
child
to
skip
about
.
He
was
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Danger
in
the
races
of
officers
,
of
cavalry
men
,
is
an
essential
*NL*
element
in
the
race
.
If
England
can
point
to
the
most
brilliant
feats
of
*NL*
cavalry
in
military
history
,
it
is
simply
owing
to
the
fact
that
she
has
*NL*
historically
developed
this
force
both
in
beasts
and
in
men
.
Sport
has
,
*NL*
in
my
opinion
,
a
great
value
,
and
as
is
always
the
case
,
we
see
nothing
*NL*
but
what
is
most
superficial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
superficial
,
''
said
Princess
Tverskaya
.
``
One
of
the
officers
,
*NL*
they
say
,
has
broken
two
ribs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
smiled
his
smile
,
which
uncovered
his
teeth
,
but
*NL*
revealed
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
admit
,
princess
,
that
that
's
not
superficial
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
*NL*
internal
.
But
that
's
not
the
point
,
''
and
he
turned
again
to
the
general
*NL*
with
whom
he
was
talking
seriously
;
``
we
must
n't
forget
that
those
who
*NL*
are
taking
part
in
the
race
are
military
men
,
who
have
chosen
that
*NL*
career
,
and
one
must
allow
that
every
calling
has
its
disagreeable
side
.
*NL*
It
forms
an
integral
part
of
the
duties
of
an
officer
.
Low
sports
,
such
*NL*
as
prize-fighting
or
Spanish
bull-fights
,
are
a
sign
of
barbarity
.
But
*NL*
specialized
trials
of
skill
are
a
sign
of
development
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
come
another
time
;
it
's
too
upsetting
,
''
said
Princess
*NL*
Betsy
.
``
Is

,
Anna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
upsetting
,
but
one
ca
n't
tear
oneself
away
,
''
said
another
lady
.
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
been
a
Roman
woman
I
should
never
have
missed
a
single
circus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
said
nothing
,
and
keeping
her
opera
glass
up
,
gazed
always
at
the
*NL*
same
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
tall
general
walked
through
the
pavilion
.
Breaking
off
*NL*
what
he
was
saying
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
got
up
hurriedly
,
though
with
*NL*
dignity
,
and
bowed
low
to
the
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
racing
?
''
the
officer
asked
,
chaffing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
race
is
a
harder
one
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
responded
*NL*
deferentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
the
answer
meant
nothing
,
the
general
looked
as
though
he
had
*NL*
heard
a
witty
remark
from
a
witty
man
,
and
fully
relished
_
la
pointe
de
*NL*
la
sauce
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
aspects
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
resumed
:
``
those
who
take
*NL*
part
and
those
who
look
on
;
and
love
for
such
spectacles
is
an
*NL*
unmistakable
proof
of
a
low
degree
of
development
in
the
spectator
,
I
*NL*
admit
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
,
bets
!
''
sounded
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
voice
from
below
,
*NL*
addressing
Betsy
.
``
Who
's
your
favorite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
and
I
are
for
Kuzovlev
,
''
replied
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
for
Vronsky
.
A
pair
of
gloves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
a
pretty
sight
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
paused
while
there
was
talking
about
him
,
but
he
*NL*
began
again
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
that
manly
sports
do
not
...
''
he
was
continuing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
the
racers
started
,
and
all
conversation
ceased
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
too
was
silent
,
and
everyone
stood
up
and
turned
*NL*
towards
the
stream
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
no
interest
in
the
race
,
*NL*
and
so
he
did
not
watch
the
racers
,
but
fell
listlessly
to
scanning
the
*NL*
spectators
with
his
weary
eyes
.
His
eyes
rested
upon
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
was
white
and
set
.
She
was
obviously
seeing
nothing
and
no
one
*NL*
but
one
man
.
Her
hand
had
convulsively
clutched
her
fan
,
and
she
held
*NL*
her
breath
.
He
looked
at
her
and
hastily
turned
away
,
scrutinizing
other
*NL*
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
here
's
this
lady
too
,
and
others
very
much
moved
as
well
;
it
's
very
*NL*
natural
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
told
himself
.
He
tried
not
to
look
at
*NL*
her
,
but
unconsciously
his
eyes
were
drawn
to
her
.
He
examined
that
face
*NL*
again
,
trying
not
to
read
what
was
so
plainly
written
on
it
,
and
against
*NL*
his
own
will
,
with
horror
read
on
it
what
he
did
not
want
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
fall
--
Kuzovlev
's
,
at
the
stream
--
agitated
everyone
,
but
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
saw
distinctly
on
Anna
's
pale
,
triumphant
face
that
the
*NL*
man
she
was
watching
had
not
fallen
.
When
,
after
Mahotin
and
Vronsky
had
*NL*
cleared
the
worst
barrier
,
the
next
officer
had
been
thrown
straight
on
*NL*
his
head
at
it
and
fatally
injured
,
and
a
shudder
of
horror
passed
over
*NL*
the
whole
public
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
that
Anna
did
not
even
*NL*
notice
it
,
and
had
some
difficulty
in
realizing
what
they
were
talking
*NL*
of
about
her
.
But
more
and
more
often
,
and
with
greater
persistence
,
he
*NL*
watched
her
.
Anna
,
wholly
engrossed
as
she
was
with
the
race
,
became
*NL*
aware
of
her
husband
's
cold
eyes
fixed
upon
her
from
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
round
for
an
instant
,
looked
inquiringly
at
him
,
and
with
a
*NL*
slight
frown
turned
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
do
n't
care
!
''
she
seemed
to
say
to
him
,
and
she
did
not
once
*NL*
glance
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
race
was
an
unlucky
one
,
and
of
the
seventeen
officers
who
rode
in
*NL*
it
more
than
half
were
thrown
and
hurt
.
Towards
the
end
of
the
race
*NL*
everyone
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
,
which
was
intensified
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
the
Tsar
was
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
was
loudly
expressing
disapprobation
,
everyone
was
repeating
a
*NL*
phrase
some
one
had
uttered
--
``
The
lions
and
gladiators
will
be
the
next
*NL*
thing
,
''
and
everyone
was
feeling
horrified
;
so
that
when
Vronsky
fell
to
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
Anna
moaned
aloud
,
there
was
nothing
very
out
of
the
way
*NL*
in
it
.
But
afterwards
a
change
came
over
Anna
's
face
which
really
was
*NL*
beyond
decorum
.
She
utterly
lost
her
head
.
She
began
fluttering
like
a
*NL*
caged
bird
,
at
one
moment
would
have
got
up
and
moved
away
,
at
the
next
*NL*
turned
to
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
let
us
go
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Betsy
did
not
hear
her
.
She
was
bending
down
,
talking
to
a
general
*NL*
who
had
come
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
up
to
Anna
and
courteously
offered
her
his
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
if
you
like
,
''
he
said
in
French
,
but
Anna
was
listening
to
*NL*
the
general
and
did
not
notice
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
broken
his
leg
too
,
so
they
say
,
''
the
general
was
saying
.
``
This
is
*NL*
beyond
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
answering
her
husband
,
Anna
lifted
her
opera
glass
and
gazed
*NL*
towards
the
place
where
Vronsky
had
fallen
;
but
it
was
so
far
off
,
and
*NL*
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
people
about
it
,
that
she
could
make
out
*NL*
nothing
.
She
laid
down
the
opera
glass
,
and
would
have
moved
away
,
but
*NL*
at
that
moment
an
officer
galloped
up
and
made
some
announcement
to
the
*NL*
Tsar
.
Anna
craned
forward
,
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
!
Stiva
!
''
she
cried
to
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
brother
did
not
hear
her
.
Again
she
would
have
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
more
I
offer
you
my
arm
if
you
want
to
be
going
,
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
reaching
towards
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
back
from
him
with
aversion
,
and
without
looking
in
his
face
*NL*
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
let
me
be
,
I
'll
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
now
that
from
the
place
of
Vronsky
's
accident
an
officer
was
*NL*
running
across
the
course
towards
the
pavilion
.
Betsy
waved
her
*NL*
handkerchief
to
him
.
The
officer
brought
the
news
that
the
rider
was
not
*NL*
killed
,
but
the
horse
had
broken
its
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
this
Anna
sat
down
hurriedly
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
fan
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
that
she
was
weeping
,
and
could
not
control
*NL*
her
tears
,
nor
even
the
sobs
that
were
shaking
her
bosom
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
stood
so
as
to
screen
her
,
giving
her
time
to
recover
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
third
time
I
offer
you
my
arm
,
''
he
said
to
her
after
a
little
*NL*
time
,
turning
to
her
.
Anna
gazed
at
him
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
*NL*
Princess
Betsy
came
to
her
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
I
brought
Anna
and
I
promised
to
take
her
*NL*
home
,
''
put
in
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
princess
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
courteously
but
looking
her
very
*NL*
firmly
in
the
face
,
``
but
I
see
that
Anna
's
not
very
well
,
and
I
wish
her
*NL*
to
come
home
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
looked
about
her
in
a
frightened
way
,
got
up
submissively
,
and
laid
*NL*
her
hand
on
her
husband
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
send
to
him
and
find
out
,
and
let
you
know
,
''
Betsy
whispered
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
left
the
pavilion
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
as
always
,
talked
to
*NL*
those
he
met
,
and
Anna
had
,
as
always
,
to
talk
and
answer
;
but
she
was
*NL*
utterly
beside
herself
,
and
moved
hanging
on
her
husband
's
arm
as
though
*NL*
in
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
killed
or
not
?
Is
it
true
?
Will
he
come
or
not
?
Shall
I
see
him
*NL*
today
?
''
she
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
seat
in
her
husband
's
carriage
in
silence
,
and
in
silence
*NL*
drove
out
of
the
crowd
of
carriages
.
In
spite
of
all
he
had
seen
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
still
did
not
allow
himself
to
consider
his
wife
's
real
*NL*
condition
.
He
merely
saw
the
outward
symptoms
.
He
saw
that
she
was
*NL*
behaving
unbecomingly
,
and
considered
it
his
duty
to
tell
her
so
.
But
it
*NL*
was
very
difficult
for
him
not
to
say
more
,
to
tell
her
nothing
but
*NL*
that
.
He
opened
his
mouth
to
tell
her
she
had
behaved
unbecomingly
,
but
*NL*
he
could
not
help
saying
something
utterly
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
inclination
we
all
have
,
though
,
for
these
cruel
spectacles
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
I
observe
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Anna
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
offended
,
and
at
once
began
to
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
obliged
to
tell
you
,
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
now
we
are
to
have
it
out
,
''
she
thought
,
and
she
felt
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
obliged
to
tell
you
that
your
behavior
has
been
unbecoming
today
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
her
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
has
my
behavior
been
unbecoming
?
''
she
said
aloud
,
turning
*NL*
her
head
swiftly
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
,
not
with
the
*NL*
bright
expression
that
seemed
covering
something
,
but
with
a
look
of
*NL*
determination
,
under
which
she
concealed
with
difficulty
the
dismay
she
*NL*
was
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
open
window
opposite
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
pulled
up
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
consider
unbecoming
?
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
despair
you
were
unable
to
conceal
at
the
accident
to
one
of
the
*NL*
riders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
for
her
to
answer
,
but
she
was
silent
,
looking
straight
before
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
already
begged
you
so
to
conduct
yourself
in
society
that
even
*NL*
malicious
tongues
can
find
nothing
to
say
against
you
.
There
was
a
time
*NL*
when
I
spoke
of
your
inward
attitude
,
but
I
am
not
speaking
of
that
now
.
*NL*
Now
I
speak
only
of
your
external
attitude
.
You
have
behaved
improperly
,
*NL*
and
I
would
wish
it
not
to
occur
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
half
of
what
he
was
saying
;
she
felt
panic-stricken
*NL*
before
him
,
and
was
thinking
whether
it
was
true
that
Vronsky
was
not
*NL*
killed
.
Was
it
of
him
they
were
speaking
when
they
said
the
rider
was
*NL*
unhurt
,
but
the
horse
had
broken
its
back
?
She
merely
smiled
with
a
*NL*
pretense
of
irony
when
he
finished
,
and
made
no
reply
,
because
she
had
*NL*
not
heard
what
he
said
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
begun
to
speak
boldly
,
*NL*
but
as
he
realized
plainly
what
he
was
speaking
of
,
the
dismay
she
was
*NL*
feeling
infected
him
too
.
He
saw
the
smile
,
and
a
strange
*NL*
misapprehension
came
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
smiling
at
my
suspicions
.
Yes
,
she
will
tell
me
directly
what
*NL*
she
told
me
before
;
that
there
is
no
foundation
for
my
suspicions
,
that
*NL*
it
's
absurd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
when
the
revelation
of
everything
was
hanging
over
him
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
he
expected
so
much
as
that
she
would
answer
mockingly
*NL*
as
before
that
his
suspicions
were
absurd
and
utterly
groundless
.
So
*NL*
terrible
to
him
was
what
he
knew
that
now
he
was
ready
to
believe
*NL*
anything
.
But
the
expression
of
her
face
,
scared
and
gloomy
,
did
not
now
*NL*
promise
even
deception
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
I
was
mistaken
,
''
said
he
.
``
If
so
,
I
beg
your
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
were
not
mistaken
,
''
she
said
deliberately
,
looking
desperately
*NL*
into
his
cold
face
.
``
You
were
not
mistaken
.
I
was
,
and
I
could
not
help
*NL*
being
in
despair
.
I
hear
you
,
but
I
am
thinking
of
him
.
I
love
him
,
I
am
*NL*
his
mistress
;
I
ca
n't
bear
you
;
I
'm
afraid
of
you
,
and
I
hate
you
...
*NL*
You
can
do
what
you
like
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
dropping
back
into
the
corner
of
the
carriage
,
she
broke
into
sobs
,
*NL*
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
stir
,
and
*NL*
kept
looking
straight
before
him
.
But
his
whole
face
suddenly
bore
the
*NL*
solemn
rigidity
of
the
dead
,
and
his
expression
did
not
change
during
*NL*
the
whole
time
of
the
drive
home
.
On
reaching
the
house
he
turned
his
*NL*
head
to
her
,
still
with
the
same
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
But
I
expect
a
strict
observance
of
the
external
forms
of
*NL*
propriety
till
such
time
''
--
his
voice
shook
--
``
as
I
may
take
measures
to
*NL*
secure
my
honor
and
communicate
them
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
out
first
and
helped
her
to
get
out
.
Before
the
servants
he
*NL*
pressed
her
hand
,
took
his
seat
in
the
carriage
,
and
drove
back
to
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Immediately
afterwards
a
footman
came
from
Princess
Betsy
*NL*
and
brought
Anna
a
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sent
to
Alexey
to
find
out
how
he
is
,
and
he
writes
me
he
is
quite
*NL*
well
and
unhurt
,
but
in
despair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
_
he
_
will
be
here
,
''
she
thought
.
``
What
a
good
thing
I
told
him
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
her
watch
.
She
had
still
three
hours
to
wait
,
and
the
*NL*
memories
of
their
last
meeting
set
her
blood
in
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
how
light
it
is
!
It
's
dreadful
,
but
I
do
love
to
see
his
face
,
*NL*
and
I
do
love
this
fantastic
light
...
My
husband
!
Oh
!
yes
...
Well
,
*NL*
thank
God
!
everything
's
over
with
him

Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
little
German
watering-place
to
which
the
Shtcherbatskys
had
*NL*
betaken
themselves
,
as
in
all
places
indeed
where
people
are
gathered
*NL*
together
,
the
usual
process
,
as
it
were
,
of
the
crystallization
of
*NL*
society
went
on
,
assigning
to
each
member
of
that
society
a
definite
and
*NL*
unalterable
place
.
Just
as
the
particle
of
water
in
frost
,
definitely
*NL*
and
unalterably
,
takes
the
special
form
of
the
crystal
of
snow
,
so
each
*NL*
new
person
that
arrived
at
the
springs
was
at
once
placed
in
his
special
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Fuerst
_
Shtcherbatsky
,
_
sammt
Gemahlin
und
Tochter
_
,
by
the
apartments
*NL*
they
took
,
and
from
their
name
and
from
the
friends
they
made
,
were
*NL*
immediately
crystallized
into
a
definite
place
marked
out
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
visiting
the
watering-place
that
year
a
real
German
Fuerstin
,
*NL*
in
consequence
of
which
the
crystallizing
process
went
on
more
*NL*
vigorously
than
ever
.
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
wished
,
above
everything
,
*NL*
to
present
her
daughter
to
this
German
princess
,
and
the
day
after
their
*NL*
arrival
she
duly
performed
this
rite
.
Kitty
made
a
low
and
graceful
*NL*
curtsey
in
the
_
very
simple
_
,
that
is
to
say
,
very
elegant
frock
that
*NL*
had
been
ordered
her
from
Paris
.
The
German
princess
said
,
``
I
hope
the
*NL*
roses
will
soon
come
back
to
this
pretty
little
face
,
''
and
for
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
certain
definite
lines
of
existence
were
at
once
laid
*NL*
down
from
which
there
was
no
departing
.
The
Shtcherbatskys
made
the
*NL*
acquaintance
too
of
the
family
of
an
English
Lady
Somebody
,
and
of
a
*NL*
German
countess
and
her
son
,
wounded
in
the
last
war
,
and
of
a
learned
*NL*
Swede
,
and
of
M.
Canut
and
his
sister
.
But
yet
inevitably
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
were
thrown
most
into
the
society
of
a
Moscow
lady
,
Marya
*NL*
Yevgenyevna
Rtishtcheva
and
her
daughter
,
whom
Kitty
disliked
,
because
*NL*
she
had
fallen
ill
,
like
herself
,
over
a
love
affair
,
and
a
Moscow
*NL*
colonel
,
whom
Kitty
had
known
from
childhood
,
and
always
seen
in
uniform
*NL*
and
epaulets
,
and
who
now
,
with
his
little
eyes
and
his
open
neck
and
*NL*
flowered
cravat
,
was
uncommonly
ridiculous
and
tedious
,
because
there
*NL*
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
.
When
all
this
was
so
firmly
established
,
*NL*
Kitty
began
to
be
very
much
bored
,
especially
as
the
prince
went
away
to
*NL*
Carlsbad
and
she
was
left
alone
with
her
mother
.
She
took
no
interest
in
*NL*
the
people
she
knew
,
feeling
that
nothing
fresh
would
come
of
them
.
Her
*NL*
chief
mental
interest
in
the
watering-place
consisted
in
watching
and
*NL*
making
theories
about
the
people
she
did
not
know
.
It
was
characteristic
*NL*
of
Kitty
that
she
always
imagined
everything
in
people
in
the
most
*NL*
favorable
light
possible
,
especially
so
in
those
she
did
not
know
.
And
*NL*
now
as
she
made
surmises
as
to
who
people
were
,
what
were
their
*NL*
relations
to
one
another
,
and
what
they
were
like
,
Kitty
endowed
them
*NL*
with
the
most
marvelous
and
noble
characters
,
and
found
confirmation
of
*NL*
her
idea
in
her
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
people
the
one
that
attracted
her
most
was
a
Russian
girl
who
*NL*
had
come
to
the
watering-place
with
an
invalid
Russian
lady
,
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
,
as
everyone
called
her
.
Madame
Stahl
belonged
to
the
highest
*NL*
society
,
but
she
was
so
ill
that
she
could
not
walk
,
and
only
on
*NL*
exceptionally
fine
days
made
her
appearance
at
the
springs
in
an
invalid
*NL*
carriage
.
But
it
was
not
so
much
from
ill-health
as
from
pride
--
so
*NL*
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
interpreted
it
--
that
Madame
Stahl
had
not
made
*NL*
the
acquaintance
of
anyone
among
the
Russians
there
.
The
Russian
girl
*NL*
looked
after
Madame
Stahl
,
and
besides
that
,
she
was
,
as
Kitty
observed
,
*NL*
on
friendly
terms
with
all
the
invalids
who
were
seriously
ill
,
and
*NL*
there
were
many
of
them
at
the
springs
,
and
looked
after
them
in
the
*NL*
most
natural
way
.
This
Russian
girl
was
not
,
as
Kitty
gathered
,
related
*NL*
to
Madame
Stahl
,
nor
was
she
a
paid
attendant
.
Madame
Stahl
called
her
*NL*
Varenka
,
and
other
people
called
her
``
Mademoiselle
Varenka
.
''
Apart
from
*NL*
the
interest
Kitty
took
in
this
girl
's
relations
with
Madame
Stahl
and
*NL*
with
other
unknown
persons
,
Kitty
,
as
often
happened
,
felt
an
*NL*
inexplicable
attraction
to
Mademoiselle
Varenka
,
and
was
aware
when
*NL*
their
eyes
met
that
she
too
liked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Mademoiselle
Varenka
one
would
not
say
that
she
had
passed
her
first
*NL*
youth
,
but
she
was
,
as
it
were
,
a
creature
without
youth
;
she
might
have
*NL*
been
taken
for
nineteen
or
for
thirty
.
If
her
features
were
criticized
*NL*
separately
,
she
was
handsome
rather
than
plain
,
in
spite
of
the
sickly
*NL*
hue
of
her
face
.
She
would
have
been
a
good
figure
,
too
,
if
it
had
not
*NL*
been
for
her
extreme
thinness
and
the
size
of
her
head
,
which
was
too
*NL*
large
for
her
medium
height
.
But
she
was
not
likely
to
be
attractive
to
*NL*
men
.
She
was
like
a
fine
flower
,
already
past
its
bloom
and
without
*NL*
fragrance
,
though
the
petals
were
still
unwithered
.
Moreover
,
she
would
*NL*
have
been
unattractive
to
men
also
from
the
lack
of
just
what
Kitty
had
*NL*
too
much
of
--
of
the
suppressed
fire
of
vitality
,
and
the
consciousness
*NL*
of
her
own
attractiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
seemed
absorbed
in
work
about
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
,
*NL*
and
so
it
seemed
she
could
not
take
interest
in
anything
outside
it
.
It
*NL*
was
just
this
contrast
with
her
own
position
that
was
for
Kitty
the
*NL*
great
attraction
of
Mademoiselle
Varenka
.
Kitty
felt
that
in
her
,
in
her
*NL*
manner
of
life
,
she
would
find
an
example
of
what
she
was
now
so
*NL*
painfully
seeking
:
interest
in
life
,
a
dignity
in
life
--
apart
from
the
*NL*
worldly
relations
of
girls
with
men
,
which
so
revolted
Kitty
,
and
*NL*
appeared
to
her
now
as
a
shameful
hawking
about
of
goods
in
search
of
a
*NL*
purchaser
.
The
more
attentively
Kitty
watched
her
unknown
friend
,
the
*NL*
more
convinced
she
was
this
girl
was
the
perfect
creature
she
fancied
*NL*
her
,
and
the
more
eagerly
she
wished
to
make
her
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
girls
used
to
meet
several
times
a
day
,
and
every
time
they
met
,
*NL*
Kitty
's
eyes
said
:
``
Who
are
you
?
What
are
you
?
Are
you
really
the
*NL*
exquisite
creature
I
imagine
you
to
be
?
But
for
goodness
'
sake
do
n't
*NL*
suppose
,
''
her
eyes
added
,
``
that
I
would
force
my
acquaintance
on
you
,
I
*NL*
simply
admire
you
and
like
you
.
''
``
I
like
you
too
,
and
you
're
very
,
very
*NL*
sweet
.
And
I
should
like
you
better
still
,
if
I
had
time
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
unknown
girl
.
Kitty
saw
indeed
,
that
she
was
always
busy
.
*NL*
Either
she
was
taking
the
children
of
a
Russian
family
home
from
the
*NL*
springs
,
or
fetching
a
shawl
for
a
sick
lady
,
and
wrapping
her
up
in
it
,
*NL*
or
trying
to
interest
an
irritable
invalid
,
or
selecting
and
buying
*NL*
cakes
for
tea
for
someone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
the
arrival
of
the
Shtcherbatskys
there
appeared
in
the
*NL*
morning
crowd
at
the
springs
two
persons
who
attracted
universal
and
*NL*
unfavorable
attention
.
These
were
a
tall
man
with
a
stooping
figure
,
and
*NL*
huge
hands
,
in
an
old
coat
too
short
for
him
,
with
black
,
simple
,
and
*NL*
yet
terrible
eyes
,
and
a
pockmarked
,
kind-looking
woman
,
very
badly
and
*NL*
tastelessly
dressed
.
Recognizing
these
persons
as
Russians
,
Kitty
had
*NL*
already
in
her
imagination
begun
constructing
a
delightful
and
touching
*NL*
romance
about
them
.
But
the
princess
,
having
ascertained
from
the
*NL*
visitors
'
list
that
this
was
Nikolay
Levin
and
Marya
Nikolaevna
,
*NL*
explained
to
Kitty
what
a
bad
man
this
Levin
was
,
and
all
her
fancies
*NL*
about
these
two
people
vanished
.
Not
so
much
from
what
her
mother
told
*NL*
her
,
as
from
the
fact
that
it
was
Konstantin
's
brother
,
this
pair
*NL*
suddenly
seemed
to
Kitty
intensely
unpleasant
.
This
Levin
,
with
his
*NL*
continual
twitching
of
his
head
,
aroused
in
her
now
an
irrepressible
*NL*
feeling
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
that
his
big
,
terrible
eyes
,
which
persistently
pursued
*NL*
her
,
expressed
a
feeling
of
hatred
and
contempt
,
and
she
tried
to
avoid
*NL*
meeting
him
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
wet
day
;
it
had
been
raining
all
the
morning
,
and
the
invalids
,
*NL*
with
their
parasols
,
had
flocked
into
the
arcades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
walking
there
with
her
mother
and
the
Moscow
colonel
,
smart
*NL*
and
jaunty
in
his
European
coat
,
bought
ready-made
at
Frankfort
.
They
*NL*
were
walking
on
one
side
of
the
arcade
,
trying
to
avoid
Levin
,
who
was
*NL*
walking
on
the
other
side
.
Varenka
,
in
her
dark
dress
,
in
a
black
hat
*NL*
with
a
turn-down
brim
,
was
walking
up
and
down
the
whole
length
of
the
*NL*
arcade
with
a
blind
Frenchwoman
,
and
,
every
time
she
met
Kitty
,
they
*NL*
exchanged
friendly
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
could
n't
I
speak
to
her
?
''
said
Kitty
,
watching
her
unknown
*NL*
friend
,
and
noticing
that
she
was
going
up
to
the
spring
,
and
that
they
*NL*
might
come
there
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
want
to
so
much
,
I
'll
find
out
about
her
first
and
make
her
*NL*
acquaintance
myself
,
''
answered
her
mother
.
``
What
do
you
see
in
her
out
*NL*
of
the
way
?
A
companion
,
she
must
be
.
If
you
like
,
I
'll
make
*NL*
acquaintance
with
Madame
Stahl
;
I
used
to
know
her
_
belle-soeur
_
,
''
added
*NL*
the
princess
,
lifting
her
head
haughtily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
knew
that
the
princess
was
offended
that
Madame
Stahl
had
seemed
*NL*
to
avoid
making
her
acquaintance
.
Kitty
did
not
insist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
wonderfully
sweet
she
is
!
''
she
said
,
gazing
at
Varenka
just
as
she
*NL*
handed
a
glass
to
the
Frenchwoman
.
``
Look
how
natural
and
sweet
it
all
*NL*
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
funny
to
see
your
_
engouements
_
,
''
said
the
princess
.
``
No
,
we
'd
*NL*
better
go
back
,
''
she
added
,
noticing
Levin
coming
towards
them
with
his
*NL*
companion
and
a
German
doctor
,
to
whom
he
was
talking
very
noisily
and
*NL*
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
to
go
back
,
when
suddenly
they
heard
,
not
noisy
talk
,
but
*NL*
shouting
.
Levin
,
stopping
short
,
was
shouting
at
the
doctor
,
and
the
*NL*
doctor
,
too
,
was
excited
.
A
crowd
gathered
about
them
.
The
princess
and
*NL*
Kitty
beat
a
hasty
retreat
,
while
the
colonel
joined
the
crowd
to
find
*NL*
out
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
the
colonel
overtook
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
inquired
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scandalous
and
disgraceful
!
''
answered
the
colonel
.
``
The
one
thing
to
be
*NL*
dreaded
is
meeting
Russians
abroad
.
That
tall
gentleman
was
abusing
the
*NL*
doctor
,
flinging
all
sorts
of
insults
at
him
because
he
was
n't
treating
*NL*
him
quite
as
he
liked
,
and
he
began
waving
his
stick
at
him
.
It
's
simply
*NL*
a
scandal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
unpleasant
!
''
said
the
princess
.
``
Well
,
and
how
did
it
end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckily
at
that
point
that
...
the
one
in
the
mushroom
hat
...
*NL*
intervened
.
A
Russian
lady
,
I
think
she
is
,
''
said
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Varenka
?
''
asked
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
She
came
to
the
rescue
before
anyone
;
she
took
the
man
by
the
*NL*
arm
and
led
him
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
mamma
,
''
said
Kitty
;
``
you
wonder
that
I
'm
enthusiastic
about
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
as
she
watched
her
unknown
friend
,
Kitty
noticed
that
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Varenka
was
already
on
the
same
terms
with
Levin
and
his
*NL*
companion
as
with
her
other
_
proteges
_
.
She
went
up
to
them
,
entered
*NL*
into
conversation
with
them
,
and
served
as
interpreter
for
the
woman
,
*NL*
who
could
not
speak
any
foreign
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
began
to
entreat
her
mother
still
more
urgently
to
let
her
make
*NL*
friends
with
Varenka
.
And
,
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
the
princess
to
*NL*
seem
to
take
the
first
step
in
wishing
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
,
who
thought
fit
to
give
herself
airs
,
she
made
inquiries
*NL*
about
Varenka
,
and
,
having
ascertained
particulars
about
her
tending
to
*NL*
prove
that
there
could
be
no
harm
though
little
good
in
the
*NL*
acquaintance
,
she
herself
approached
Varenka
and
made
acquaintance
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Choosing
a
time
when
her
daughter
had
gone
to
the
spring
,
while
Varenka
*NL*
had
stopped
outside
the
baker
's
,
the
princess
went
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
''
she
said
,
with
her
dignified
*NL*
smile
.
``
My
daughter
has
lost
her
heart
to
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
Possibly
you
*NL*
do
not
know
me
.
I
am
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
feeling
is
more
than
reciprocal
,
princess
,
''
Varenka
answered
*NL*
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
good
deed
you
did
yesterday
to
our
poor
compatriot
!
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
flushed
a
little
.
``
I
do
n't
remember
.
I
do
n't
think
I
did
*NL*
anything
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
saved
that
Levin
from
disagreeable
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
_
sa
compagne
_
called
me
,
and
I
tried
to
pacify
him
,
he
's
very
ill
,
*NL*
and
was
dissatisfied
with
the
doctor
.
I
'm
used
to
looking
after
such
*NL*
invalids
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
heard
you
live
at
Mentone
with
your
aunt
--
I
think
--
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
:
I
used
to
know
her
_
belle-soeur
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
not
my
aunt
.
I
call
her
mamma
,
but
I
am
not
related
to
her
;
I
*NL*
was
brought
up
by
her
,
''
answered
Varenka
,
flushing
a
little
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
so
simply
said
,
and
so
sweet
was
the
truthful
and
candid
*NL*
expression
of
her
face
,
that
the
princess
saw
why
Kitty
had
taken
such
a
*NL*
fancy
to
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
's
this
Levin
going
to
do
?
''
asked
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
going
away
,
''
answered
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Kitty
came
up
from
the
spring
beaming
with
delight
that
*NL*
her
mother
had
become
acquainted
with
her
unknown
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
see
,
Kitty
,
your
intense
desire
to
make
friends
with
*NL*
Mademoiselle
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varenka
,
''
Varenka
put
in
smiling
,
``
that
's
what
everyone
calls
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
blushed
with
pleasure
,
and
slowly
,
without
speaking
,
pressed
her
*NL*
new
friend
's
hand
,
which
did
not
respond
to
her
pressure
,
but
lay
*NL*
motionless
in
her
hand
.
The
hand
did
not
respond
to
her
pressure
,
but
*NL*
the
face
of
Mademoiselle
Varenka
glowed
with
a
soft
,
glad
,
though
rather
*NL*
mournful
smile
,
that
showed
large
but
handsome
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
long
wished
for
this
too
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
so
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
not
at
all
busy
,
''
answered
Varenka
,
but
at
that
moment
she
*NL*
had
to
leave
her
new
friends
because
two
little
Russian
girls
,
children
*NL*
of
an
invalid
,
ran
up
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varenka
,
mamma
's
calling
!
''
they
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Varenka
went
after
them
.

Chapter
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
particulars
which
the
princess
had
learned
in
regard
to
Varenka
's
*NL*
past
and
her
relations
with
Madame
Stahl
were
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
,
of
whom
some
people
said
that
she
had
worried
her
husband
*NL*
out
of
his
life
,
while
others
said
it
was
he
who
had
made
her
wretched
*NL*
by
his
immoral
behavior
,
had
always
been
a
woman
of
weak
health
and
*NL*
enthusiastic
temperament
.
When
,
after
her
separation
from
her
husband
,
*NL*
she
gave
birth
to
her
only
child
,
the
child
had
died
almost
immediately
,
*NL*
and
the
family
of
Madame
Stahl
,
knowing
her
sensibility
,
and
fearing
the
*NL*
news
would
kill
her
,
had
substituted
another
child
,
a
baby
born
the
same
*NL*
night
and
in
the
same
house
in
Petersburg
,
the
daughter
of
the
chief
*NL*
cook
of
the
Imperial
Household
.
This
was
Varenka
.
Madame
Stahl
learned
*NL*
later
on
that
Varenka
was
not
her
own
child
,
but
she
went
on
bringing
*NL*
her
up
,
especially
as
very
soon
afterwards
Varenka
had
not
a
relation
of
*NL*
her
own
living
.
Madame
Stahl
had
now
been
living
more
than
ten
years
*NL*
continuously
abroad
,
in
the
south
,
never
leaving
her
couch
.
And
some
*NL*
people
said
that
Madame
Stahl
had
made
her
social
position
as
a
*NL*
philanthropic
,
highly
religious
woman
;
other
people
said
she
really
was
*NL*
at
heart
the
highly
ethical
being
,
living
for
nothing
but
the
good
of
*NL*
her
fellow
creatures
,
which
she
represented
herself
to
be
.
No
one
knew
*NL*
what
her
faith
was
--
Catholic
,
Protestant
,
or
Orthodox
.
But
one
fact
was
*NL*
indubitable
--
she
was
in
amicable
relations
with
the
highest
dignitaries
*NL*
of
all
the
churches
and
sects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
lived
with
her
all
the
while
abroad
,
and
everyone
who
knew
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
knew
and
liked
Mademoiselle
Varenka
,
as
everyone
called
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
learned
all
these
facts
,
the
princess
found
nothing
to
object
to
*NL*
in
her
daughter
's
intimacy
with
Varenka
,
more
especially
as
Varenka
's
*NL*
breeding
and
education
were
of
the
best
--
she
spoke
French
and
English
*NL*
extremely
well
--
and
what
was
of
the
most
weight
,
brought
a
message
from
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
expressing
her
regret
that
she
was
prevented
by
her
ill
*NL*
health
from
making
the
acquaintance
of
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
getting
to
know
Varenka
,
Kitty
became
more
and
more
fascinated
by
*NL*
her
friend
,
and
every
day
she
discovered
new
virtues
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
hearing
that
Varenka
had
a
good
voice
,
asked
her
to
come
*NL*
and
sing
to
them
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
plays
,
and
we
have
a
piano
;
not
a
good
one
,
it
's
true
,
but
you
*NL*
will
give
us
so
much
pleasure
,
''
said
the
princess
with
her
affected
*NL*
smile
,
which
Kitty
disliked
particularly
just
then
,
because
she
noticed
*NL*
that
Varenka
had
no
inclination
to
sing
.
Varenka
came
,
however
,
in
the
*NL*
evening
and
brought
a
roll
of
music
with
her
.
The
princess
had
invited
*NL*
Marya
Yevgenyevna
and
her
daughter
and
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
seemed
quite
unaffected
by
there
being
persons
present
she
did
*NL*
not
know
,
and
she
went
directly
to
the
piano
.
She
could
not
accompany
*NL*
herself
,
but
she
could
sing
music
at
sight
very
well
.
Kitty
,
who
played
*NL*
well
,
accompanied
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
an
extraordinary
talent
,
''
the
princess
said
to
her
after
*NL*
Varenka
had
sung
the
first
song
extremely
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Yevgenyevna
and
her
daughter
expressed
their
thanks
and
*NL*
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
''
said
the
colonel
,
looking
out
of
the
window
,
``
what
an
audience
*NL*
has
collected
to
listen
to
you
.
''
There
actually
was
quite
a
considerable
*NL*
crowd
under
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
it
gives
you
pleasure
,
''
Varenka
answered
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
looked
with
pride
at
her
friend
.
She
was
enchanted
by
her
talent
,
*NL*
and
her
voice
,
and
her
face
,
but
most
of
all
by
her
manner
,
by
the
way
*NL*
Varenka
obviously
thought
nothing
of
her
singing
and
was
quite
unmoved
*NL*
by
their
praises
.
She
seemed
only
to
be
asking
:
``
Am
I
to
sing
again
,
or
*NL*
is
that
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
been
I
,
''
thought
Kitty
,
``
how
proud
I
should
have
been
!
How
*NL*
delighted
I
should
have
been
to
see
that
crowd
under
the
windows
!
But
*NL*
she
's
utterly
unmoved
by
it
.
Her
only
motive
is
to
avoid
refusing
and
to
*NL*
please
mamma
.
What
is
there
in
her
?
What
is
it
gives
her
the
power
to
*NL*
look
down
on
everything
,
to
be
calm
independently
of
everything
?
How
I
*NL*
should
like
to
know
it
and
to
learn
it
of
her
!
''
thought
Kitty
,
gazing
*NL*
into
her
serene
face
.
The
princess
asked
Varenka
to
sing
again
,
and
*NL*
Varenka
sang
another
song
,
also
smoothly
,
distinctly
,
and
well
,
standing
*NL*
erect
at
the
piano
and
beating
time
on
it
with
her
thin
,
dark-skinned
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
song
in
the
book
was
an
Italian
one
.
Kitty
played
the
opening
*NL*
bars
,
and
looked
round
at
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
skip
that
,
''
said
Varenka
,
flushing
a
little
.
Kitty
let
her
eyes
*NL*
rest
on
Varenka
's
face
,
with
a
look
of
dismay
and
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
the
next
one
,
''
she
said
hurriedly
,
turning
over
the
pages
,
*NL*
and
at
once
feeling
that
there
was
something
connected
with
the
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Varenka
with
a
smile
,
laying
her
hand
on
the
music
,
``
no
,
*NL*
let
's
have
that
one
.
''
And
she
sang
it
just
as
quietly
,
as
coolly
,
and
as
*NL*
well
as
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
finished
,
they
all
thanked
her
again
,
and
went
off
to
tea
.
*NL*
Kitty
and
Varenka
went
out
into
the
little
garden
that
adjoined
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
right
,
that
you
have
some
reminiscences
connected
with
that
song
?
''
*NL*
said
Kitty
.
``
Do
n't
tell
me
,
''
she
added
hastily
,
``
only
say
if
I
'm
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
why
not
?
I
'll
tell
you
simply
,
''
said
Varenka
,
and
,
without
waiting
*NL*
for
a
reply
,
she
went
on
:
``
Yes
,
it
brings
up
memories
,
once
painful
*NL*
ones
.
I
cared
for
someone
once
,
and
I
used
to
sing
him
that
song
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
with
big
,
wide-open
eyes
gazed
silently
,
sympathetically
at
*NL*
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
cared
for
him
,
and
he
cared
for
me
;
but
his
mother
did
not
wish
it
,
*NL*
and
he
married
another
girl
.
He
's
living
now
not
far
from
us
,
and
I
see
*NL*
him
sometimes
.
You
did
n't
think
I
had
a
love
story
too
,
''
she
said
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
faint
gleam
in
her
handsome
face
of
that
fire
which
Kitty
*NL*
felt
must
once
have
glowed
all
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
so
?
Why
,
if
I
were
a
man
,
I
could
never
care
for
anyone
*NL*
else
after
knowing
you
.
Only
I
ca
n't
understand
how
he
could
,
to
please
*NL*
his
mother
,
forget
you
and
make
you
unhappy
;
he
had
no
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
he
's
a
very
good
man
,
and
I
'm
not
unhappy
;
quite
the
contrary
,
*NL*
I
'm
very
happy
.
Well
,
so
we
sha
n't
be
singing
any
more
now
,
''
she
added
,
*NL*
turning
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
you
are
!
how
good
you
are
!
''
cried
Kitty
,
and
stopping
her
,
she
*NL*
kissed
her
.
``
If
I
could
only
be
even
a
little
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
be
like
anyone
?
You
're
nice
as
you
are
,
''
said
Varenka
,
*NL*
smiling
her
gentle
,
weary
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
nice
at
all
.
Come
,
tell
me
...
Stop
a
minute
,
let
's
sit
*NL*
down
,
''
said
Kitty
,
making
her
sit
down
again
beside
her
.
``
Tell
me
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
humiliating
to
think
that
a
man
has
disdained
your
love
,
that
he
*NL*
has
n't
cared
for
it
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
did
n't
disdain
it
;
I
believe
he
cared
for
me
,
but
he
was
a
*NL*
dutiful
son
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
if
it
had
n't
been
on
account
of
his
mother
,
if
it
had
been
his
*NL*
own
doing
?
...
''
said
Kitty
,
feeling
she
was
giving
away
her
secret
,
and
*NL*
that
her
face
,
burning
with
the
flush
of
shame
,
had
betrayed
her
*NL*
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
he
would
have
done
wrong
,
and
I
should
not
have
regretted
*NL*
him
,
''
answered
Varenka
,
evidently
realizing
that
they
were
now
talking
*NL*
not
of
her
,
but
of
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
humiliation
,
''
said
Kitty
,
``
the
humiliation
one
can
never
*NL*
forget
,
can
never
forget
,
''
she
said
,
remembering
her
look
at
the
last
*NL*
ball
during
the
pause
in
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
humiliation
?
Why
,
you
did
nothing
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
than
wrong
--
shameful

*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
shook
her
head
and
laid
her
hand
on
Kitty
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
is
there
shameful
?
''
she
said
.
``
You
did
n't
tell
a
man
,
who
*NL*
did
n't
care
for
you
,
that
you
loved
him
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
;
I
never
said
a
word
,
but
he
knew
it
.
No
,
no
,
there
are
*NL*
looks
,
there
are
ways
;
I
ca
n't
forget
it
,
if
I
live
a
hundred
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
The
whole
point
is
whether
you
love
him
now
*NL*
or
not
,
''
said
Varenka
,
who
called
everything
by
its
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
him
;
I
ca
n't
forgive
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
shame
,
the
humiliation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
if
everyone
were
as
sensitive
as
you
are
!
''
said
Varenka
.
``
There
*NL*
is
n't
a
girl
who
has
n't
been
through
the
same
.
And
it
's
all
so
*NL*
unimportant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
is
important
?
''
said
Kitty
,
looking
into
her
face
with
*NL*
inquisitive
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
's
so
much
that
's
important
,
''
said
Varenka
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
much
that
's
more
important
,
''
answered
Varenka
,
not
knowing
what
*NL*
to
say
.
But
at
that
instant
they
heard
the
princess
's
voice
from
the
*NL*
window
.
``
Kitty
,
it
's
cold
!
Either
get
a
shawl
,
or
come
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
is
time
to
go
in
!
''
said
Varenka
,
getting
up
.
``
I
have
to
go
on
*NL*
to
Madame
Berthe
's
;
she
asked
me
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
held
her
by
the
hand
,
and
with
passionate
curiosity
and
entreaty
*NL*
her
eyes
asked
her
:
``
What
is
it
,
what
is
this
of
such
importance
that
*NL*
gives
you
such
tranquillity
?
You
know
,
tell
me
!
''
But
Varenka
did
not
*NL*
even
know
what
Kitty
's
eyes
were
asking
her
.
She
merely
thought
that
she
*NL*
had
to
go
to
see
Madame
Berthe
too
that
evening
,
and
to
make
haste
home
*NL*
in
time
for
_
maman
's
_
tea
at
twelve
o'clock
.
She
went
indoors
,
collected
*NL*
her
music
,
and
saying
good-bye
to
everyone
,
was
about
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow
me
to
see
you
home
,
''
said
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
how
can
you
go
alone
at
night
like
this
?
''
chimed
in
the
princess
.
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
I
'll
send
Parasha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
saw
that
Varenka
could
hardly
restrain
a
smile
at
the
idea
that
*NL*
she
needed
an
escort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
always
go
about
alone
and
nothing
ever
happens
to
me
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
taking
her
hat
.
And
kissing
Kitty
once
more
,
without
saying
what
was
*NL*
important
,
she
stepped
out
courageously
with
the
music
under
her
arm
and
*NL*
vanished
into
the
twilight
of
the
summer
night
,
bearing
away
with
her
*NL*
her
secret
of
what
was
important
and
what
gave
her
the
calm
and
dignity
*NL*
so
much
to
be
envied
.

*NL*
Chapter
33
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
made
the
acquaintance
of
Madame
Stahl
too
,
and
this
acquaintance
,
*NL*
together
with
her
friendship
with
Varenka
,
did
not
merely
exercise
a
*NL*
great
influence
on
her
,
it
also
comforted
her
in
her
mental
distress
.
*NL*
She
found
this
comfort
through
a
completely
new
world
being
opened
to
*NL*
her
by
means
of
this
acquaintance
,
a
world
having
nothing
in
common
with
*NL*
her
past
,
an
exalted
,
noble
world
,
from
the
height
of
which
she
could
*NL*
contemplate
her
past
calmly
.
It
was
revealed
to
her
that
besides
the
*NL*
instinctive
life
to
which
Kitty
had
given
herself
up
hitherto
there
was
*NL*
a
spiritual
life
.
This
life
was
disclosed
in
religion
,
but
a
religion
*NL*
having
nothing
in
common
with
that
one
which
Kitty
had
known
from
*NL*
childhood
,
and
which
found
expression
in
litanies
and
all-night
services
*NL*
at
the
Widow
's
Home
,
where
one
might
meet
one
's
friends
,
and
in
learning
*NL*
by
heart
Slavonic
texts
with
the
priest
.
This
was
a
lofty
,
mysterious
*NL*
religion
connected
with
a
whole
series
of
noble
thoughts
and
feelings
,
*NL*
which
one
could
do
more
than
merely
believe
because
one
was
told
to
,
*NL*
which
one
could
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
found
all
this
out
not
from
words
.
Madame
Stahl
talked
to
Kitty
as
*NL*
to
a
charming
child
that
one
looks
on
with
pleasure
as
on
the
memory
of
*NL*
one
's
youth
,
and
only
once
she
said
in
passing
that
in
all
human
sorrows
*NL*
nothing
gives
comfort
but
love
and
faith
,
and
that
in
the
sight
of
*NL*
Christ
's
compassion
for
us
no
sorrow
is
trifling
--
and
immediately
talked
*NL*
of
other
things
.
But
in
every
gesture
of
Madame
Stahl
,
in
every
word
,
in
*NL*
every
heavenly
--
as
Kitty
called
it
--
look
,
and
above
all
in
the
whole
*NL*
story
of
her
life
,
which
she
heard
from
Varenka
,
Kitty
recognized
that
*NL*
something
``
that
was
important
,
''
of
which
,
till
then
,
she
had
known
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
elevated
as
Madame
Stahl
's
character
was
,
touching
as
was
her
*NL*
story
,
and
exalted
and
moving
as
was
her
speech
,
Kitty
could
not
help
*NL*
detecting
in
her
some
traits
which
perplexed
her
.
She
noticed
that
when
*NL*
questioning
her
about
her
family
,
Madame
Stahl
had
smiled
*NL*
contemptuously
,
which
was
not
in
accord
with
Christian
meekness
.
She
*NL*
noticed
,
too
,
that
when
she
had
found
a
Catholic
priest
with
her
,
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
had
studiously
kept
her
face
in
the
shadow
of
the
lamp-shade
and
*NL*
had
smiled
in
a
peculiar
way
.
Trivial
as
these
two
observations
were
,
*NL*
they
perplexed
her
,
and
she
had
her
doubts
as
to
Madame
Stahl
.
But
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
Varenka
,
alone
in
the
world
,
without
friends
or
*NL*
relations
,
with
a
melancholy
disappointment
in
the
past
,
desiring
*NL*
nothing
,
regretting
nothing
,
was
just
that
perfection
of
which
Kitty
*NL*
dared
hardly
dream
.
In
Varenka
she
realized
that
one
has
but
to
forget
*NL*
oneself
and
love
others
,
and
one
will
be
calm
,
happy
,
and
noble
.
And
*NL*
that
was
what
Kitty
longed
to
be
.
Seeing
now
clearly
what
was
_
the
most
*NL*
important
_
,
Kitty
was
not
satisfied
with
being
enthusiastic
over
it
;
she
*NL*
at
once
gave
herself
up
with
her
whole
soul
to
the
new
life
that
was
*NL*
opening
to
her
.
From
Varenka
's
accounts
of
the
doings
of
Madame
Stahl
*NL*
and
other
people
whom
she
mentioned
,
Kitty
had
already
constructed
the
*NL*
plan
of
her
own
future
life
.
She
would
,
like
Madame
Stahl
's
niece
,
*NL*
Aline
,
of
whom
Varenka
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
,
seek
out
those
*NL*
who
were
in
trouble
,
wherever
she
might
be
living
,
help
them
as
far
as
*NL*
she
could
,
give
them
the
Gospel
,
read
the
Gospel
to
the
sick
,
to
*NL*
criminals
,
to
the
dying
.
The
idea
of
reading
the
Gospel
to
criminals
,
as
*NL*
Aline
did
,
particularly
fascinated
Kitty
.
But
all
these
were
secret
*NL*
dreams
,
of
which
Kitty
did
not
talk
either
to
her
mother
or
to
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
awaiting
the
time
for
carrying
out
her
plans
on
a
large
scale
,
*NL*
however
,
Kitty
,
even
then
at
the
springs
,
where
there
were
so
many
*NL*
people
ill
and
unhappy
,
readily
found
a
chance
for
practicing
her
new
*NL*
principles
in
imitation
of
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
princess
noticed
nothing
but
that
Kitty
was
much
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
her
_
engouement
_
,
as
she
called
it
,
for
Madame
Stahl
,
and
*NL*
still
more
for
Varenka
.
She
saw
that
Kitty
did
not
merely
imitate
*NL*
Varenka
in
her
conduct
,
but
unconsciously
imitated
her
in
her
manner
of
*NL*
walking
,
of
talking
,
of
blinking
her
eyes
.
But
later
on
the
princess
*NL*
noticed
that
,
apart
from
this
adoration
,
some
kind
of
serious
spiritual
*NL*
change
was
taking
place
in
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
saw
that
in
the
evenings
Kitty
read
a
French
testament
that
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
had
given
her
--
a
thing
she
had
never
done
before
;
that
she
*NL*
avoided
society
acquaintances
and
associated
with
the
sick
people
who
*NL*
were
under
Varenka
's
protection
,
and
especially
one
poor
family
,
that
of
*NL*
a
sick
painter
,
Petrov
.
Kitty
was
unmistakably
proud
of
playing
the
part
*NL*
of
a
sister
of
mercy
in
that
family
.
All
this
was
well
enough
,
and
the
*NL*
princess
had
nothing
to
say
against
it
,
especially
as
Petrov
's
wife
was
*NL*
a
perfectly
nice
sort
of
woman
,
and
that
the
German
princess
,
noticing
*NL*
Kitty
's
devotion
,
praised
her
,
calling
her
an
angel
of
consolation
.
All
*NL*
this
would
have
been
very
well
,
if
there
had
been
no
exaggeration
.
But
*NL*
the
princess
saw
that
her
daughter
was
rushing
into
extremes
,
and
so
*NL*
indeed
she
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Il
ne
faut
jamais
rien
outrer
_
,
''
she
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
daughter
made
her
no
reply
,
only
in
her
heart
she
thought
that
one
*NL*
could
not
talk
about
exaggeration
where
Christianity
was
concerned
.
What
*NL*
exaggeration
could
there
be
in
the
practice
of
a
doctrine
wherein
one
*NL*
was
bidden
to
turn
the
other
cheek
when
one
was
smitten
,
and
give
one
's
*NL*
cloak
if
one
's
coat
were
taken
?
But
the
princess
disliked
this
*NL*
exaggeration
,
and
disliked
even
more
the
fact
that
she
felt
her
daughter
*NL*
did
not
care
to
show
her
all
her
heart
.
Kitty
did
in
fact
conceal
her
*NL*
new
views
and
feelings
from
her
mother
.
She
concealed
them
not
because
*NL*
she
did
not
respect
or
did
not
love
her
mother
,
but
simply
because
she
*NL*
was
her
mother
.
She
would
have
revealed
them
to
anyone
sooner
than
to
*NL*
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
Anna
Pavlovna
's
not
been
to
see
us
for
so
long
?
''
the
princess
*NL*
said
one
day
of
Madame
Petrova
.
``
I
've
asked
her
,
but
she
seems
put
out
*NL*
about
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
noticed
it
,
maman
,
''
said
Kitty
,
flushing
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
long
since
you
went
to
see
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
meaning
to
make
an
expedition
to
the
mountains
tomorrow
,
''
*NL*
answered
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
go
,
''
answered
the
princess
,
gazing
at
her
daughter
's
*NL*
embarrassed
face
and
trying
to
guess
the
cause
of
her
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
Varenka
came
to
dinner
and
told
them
that
Anna
Pavlovna
had
*NL*
changed
her
mind
and
given
up
the
expedition
for
the
morrow
.
And
the
*NL*
princess
noticed
again
that
Kitty
reddened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
have
n't
you
had
some
misunderstanding
with
the
Petrovs
?
''
said
*NL*
the
princess
,
when
they
were
left
alone
.
``
Why
has
she
given
up
sending
*NL*
the
children
and
coming
to
see
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
answered
that
nothing
had
happened
between
them
,
and
that
she
*NL*
could
not
tell
why
Anna
Pavlovna
seemed
displeased
with
her
.
Kitty
*NL*
answered
perfectly
truly
.
She
did
not
know
the
reason
Anna
Pavlovna
had
*NL*
changed
to
her
,
but
she
guessed
it
.
She
guessed
at
something
which
she
*NL*
could
not
tell
her
mother
,
which
she
did
not
put
into
words
to
herself
.
*NL*
It
was
one
of
those
things
which
one
knows
but
which
one
can
never
speak
*NL*
of
even
to
oneself
,
so
terrible
and
shameful
would
it
be
to
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
and
again
she
went
over
in
her
memory
all
her
relations
with
the
*NL*
family
.
She
remembered
the
simple
delight
expressed
on
the
round
,
*NL*
good-humored
face
of
Anna
Pavlovna
at
their
meetings
;
she
remembered
*NL*
their
secret
confabulations
about
the
invalid
,
their
plots
to
draw
him
*NL*
away
from
the
work
which
was
forbidden
him
,
and
to
get
him
out-of-doors
;
*NL*
the
devotion
of
the
youngest
boy
,
who
used
to
call
her
``
my
Kitty
,
''
and
*NL*
would
not
go
to
bed
without
her
.
How
nice
it
all
was
!
Then
she
recalled
*NL*
the
thin
,
terribly
thin
figure
of
Petrov
,
with
his
long
neck
,
in
his
*NL*
brown
coat
,
his
scant
,
curly
hair
,
his
questioning
blue
eyes
that
were
*NL*
so
terrible
to
Kitty
at
first
,
and
his
painful
attempts
to
seem
hearty
*NL*
and
lively
in
her
presence
.
She
recalled
the
efforts
she
had
made
at
*NL*
first
to
overcome
the
repugnance
she
felt
for
him
,
as
for
all
*NL*
consumptive
people
,
and
the
pains
it
had
cost
her
to
think
of
things
to
*NL*
say
to
him
.
She
recalled
the
timid
,
softened
look
with
which
he
gazed
at
*NL*
her
,
and
the
strange
feeling
of
compassion
and
awkwardness
,
and
later
of
*NL*
a
sense
of
her
own
goodness
,
which
she
had
felt
at
it
.
How
nice
it
all
*NL*
was
!
But
all
that
was
at
first
.
Now
,
a
few
days
ago
,
everything
was
*NL*
suddenly
spoiled
.
Anna
Pavlovna
had
met
Kitty
with
affected
cordiality
,
*NL*
and
had
kept
continual
watch
on
her
and
on
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
that
touching
pleasure
he
showed
when
she
came
near
be
the
cause
*NL*
of
Anna
Pavlovna
's
coolness
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
mused
,
``
there
was
something
unnatural
about
Anna
Pavlovna
,
*NL*
and
utterly
unlike
her
good
nature
,
when
she
said
angrily
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
:
`
There
,
he
will
keep
waiting
for
you
;
he
would
n't
drink
his
*NL*
coffee
without
you
,
though
he
's
grown
so
dreadfully
weak
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
,
too
,
she
did
n't
like
it
when
I
gave
him
the
rug
.
It
was
*NL*
all
so
simple
,
but
he
took
it
so
awkwardly
,
and
was
so
long
thanking
me
,
*NL*
that
I
felt
awkward
too
.
And
then
that
portrait
of
me
he
did
so
well
.
*NL*
And
most
of
all
that
look
of
confusion
and
tenderness
!
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
*NL*
it
!
''
Kitty
repeated
to
herself
with
horror
.
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
be
,
it
*NL*
ought
n't
to
be
!
He
's
so
much
to
be
pitied
!
''
she
said
to
herself
directly
*NL*
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
doubt
poisoned
the
charm
of
her
new
life
.

Chapter
34
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
end
of
the
course
of
drinking
the
waters
,
Prince
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
,
who
had
gone
on
from
Carlsbad
to
Baden
and
Kissingen
to
*NL*
Russian
friends
--
to
get
a
breath
of
Russian
air
,
as
he
said
--
came
back
*NL*
to
his
wife
and
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
views
of
the
prince
and
of
the
princess
on
life
abroad
were
*NL*
completely
opposed
.
The
princess
thought
everything
delightful
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
established
position
in
Russian
society
,
she
tried
abroad
*NL*
to
be
like
a
European
fashionable
lady
,
which
she
was
not
--
for
the
*NL*
simple
reason
that
she
was
a
typical
Russian
gentlewoman
;
and
so
she
was
*NL*
affected
,
which
did
not
altogether
suit
her
.
The
prince
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
thought
everything
foreign
detestable
,
got
sick
of
European
*NL*
life
,
kept
to
his
Russian
habits
,
and
purposely
tried
to
show
himself
*NL*
abroad
less
European
than
he
was
in
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
returned
thinner
,
with
the
skin
hanging
in
loose
bags
on
his
*NL*
cheeks
,
but
in
the
most
cheerful
frame
of
mind
.
His
good
humor
was
even
*NL*
greater
when
he
saw
Kitty
completely
recovered
.
The
news
of
Kitty
's
*NL*
friendship
with
Madame
Stahl
and
Varenka
,
and
the
reports
the
princess
*NL*
gave
him
of
some
kind
of
change
she
had
noticed
in
Kitty
,
troubled
the
*NL*
prince
and
aroused
his
habitual
feeling
of
jealousy
of
everything
that
*NL*
drew
his
daughter
away
from
him
,
and
a
dread
that
his
daughter
might
*NL*
have
got
out
of
the
reach
of
his
influence
into
regions
inaccessible
to
*NL*
him
.
But
these
unpleasant
matters
were
all
drowned
in
the
sea
of
*NL*
kindliness
and
good
humor
which
was
always
within
him
,
and
more
so
than
*NL*
ever
since
his
course
of
Carlsbad
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
arrival
the
prince
,
in
his
long
overcoat
,
with
his
*NL*
Russian
wrinkles
and
baggy
cheeks
propped
up
by
a
starched
collar
,
set
*NL*
off
with
his
daughter
to
the
spring
in
the
greatest
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
morning
:
the
bright
,
cheerful
houses
with
their
little
*NL*
gardens
,
the
sight
of
the
red-faced
,
red-armed
,
beer-drinking
German
*NL*
waitresses
,
working
away
merrily
,
did
the
heart
good
.
But
the
nearer
*NL*
they
got
to
the
springs
the
oftener
they
met
sick
people
;
and
their
*NL*
appearance
seemed
more
pitiable
than
ever
among
the
everyday
conditions
*NL*
of
prosperous
German
life
.
Kitty
was
no
longer
struck
by
this
contrast
.
*NL*
The
bright
sun
,
the
brilliant
green
of
the
foliage
,
the
strains
of
the
*NL*
music
were
for
her
the
natural
setting
of
all
these
familiar
faces
,
with
*NL*
their
changes
to
greater
emaciation
or
to
convalescence
,
for
which
she
*NL*
watched
.
But
to
the
prince
the
brightness
and
gaiety
of
the
June
*NL*
morning
,
and
the
sound
of
the
orchestra
playing
a
gay
waltz
then
in
*NL*
fashion
,
and
above
all
,
the
appearance
of
the
healthy
attendants
,
seemed
*NL*
something
unseemly
and
monstrous
,
in
conjunction
with
these
slowly
*NL*
moving
,
dying
figures
gathered
together
from
all
parts
of
Europe
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
his
feeling
of
pride
and
,
as
it
were
,
of
the
return
of
youth
,
*NL*
with
his
favorite
daughter
on
his
arm
,
he
felt
awkward
,
and
almost
*NL*
ashamed
of
his
vigorous
step
and
his
sturdy
,
stout
limbs
.
He
felt
almost
*NL*
like
a
man
not
dressed
in
a
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Present
me
to
your
new
friends
,
''
he
said
to
his
daughter
,
squeezing
her
*NL*
hand
with
his
elbow
.
``
I
like
even
your
horrid
Soden
for
making
you
so
*NL*
well
again
.
Only
it
's
melancholy
,
very
melancholy
here
.
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
mentioned
the
names
of
all
the
people
they
met
,
with
some
of
whom
*NL*
she
was
acquainted
and
some
not
.
At
the
entrance
of
the
garden
they
met
*NL*
the
blind
lady
,
Madame
Berthe
,
with
her
guide
,
and
the
prince
was
*NL*
delighted
to
see
the
old
Frenchwoman
's
face
light
up
when
she
heard
*NL*
Kitty
's
voice
.
She
at
once
began
talking
to
him
with
French
exaggerated
*NL*
politeness
,
applauding
him
for
having
such
a
delightful
daughter
,
*NL*
extolling
Kitty
to
the
skies
before
her
face
,
and
calling
her
a
*NL*
treasure
,
a
pearl
,
and
a
consoling
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
the
second
angel
,
then
,
''
said
the
prince
,
smiling
.
``
she
*NL*
calls
Mademoiselle
Varenka
angel
number
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Mademoiselle
Varenka
,
she
's
a
real
angel
,
allez
,
''
Madame
Berthe
*NL*
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
arcade
they
met
Varenka
herself
.
She
was
walking
rapidly
towards
*NL*
them
carrying
an
elegant
red
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
papa
come
,
''
Kitty
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
made
--
simply
and
naturally
as
she
did
everything
--
a
movement
*NL*
between
a
bow
and
a
curtsey
,
and
immediately
began
talking
to
the
*NL*
prince
,
without
shyness
,
naturally
,
as
she
talked
to
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
know
you
;
I
know
you
very
well
,
''
the
prince
said
to
her
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
in
which
Kitty
detected
with
joy
that
her
father
liked
her
*NL*
friend
.
``
Where
are
you
off
to
in
such
haste
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maman
's
here
,
''
she
said
,
turning
to
Kitty
.
``
She
has
not
slept
all
*NL*
night
,
and
the
doctor
advised
her
to
go
out
.
I
'm
taking
her
her
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
angel
number
one
?
''
said
the
prince
when
Varenka
had
gone
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
saw
that
her
father
had
meant
to
make
fun
of
Varenka
,
but
that
he
*NL*
could
not
do
it
because
he
liked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
so
we
shall
see
all
your
friends
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
even
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
,
if
she
deigns
to
recognize
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
did
you
know
her
,
papa
?
''
Kitty
asked
apprehensively
,
catching
the
*NL*
gleam
of
irony
that
kindled
in
the
prince
's
eyes
at
the
mention
of
*NL*
Madame
Stahl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
know
her
husband
,
and
her
too
a
little
,
before
she
'd
joined
*NL*
the
Pietists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
Pietist
,
papa
?
''
asked
Kitty
,
dismayed
to
find
that
what
she
*NL*
prized
so
highly
in
Madame
Stahl
had
a
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
know
myself
.
I
only
know
that
she
thanks
God
for
*NL*
everything
,
for
every
misfortune
,
and
thanks
God
too
that
her
husband
*NL*
died
.
And
that
's
rather
droll
,
as
they
did
n't
get
on
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
What
a
piteous
face
!
''
he
asked
,
noticing
a
sick
man
of
*NL*
medium
height
sitting
on
a
bench
,
wearing
a
brown
overcoat
and
white
*NL*
trousers
that
fell
in
strange
folds
about
his
long
,
fleshless
legs
.
This
*NL*
man
lifted
his
straw
hat
,
showed
his
scanty
curly
hair
and
high
*NL*
forehead
,
painfully
reddened
by
the
pressure
of
the
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Petrov
,
an
artist
,
''
answered
Kitty
,
blushing
.
``
And
that
's
his
*NL*
wife
,
''
she
added
,
indicating
Anna
Pavlovna
,
who
,
as
though
on
purpose
,
*NL*
at
the
very
instant
they
approached
walked
away
after
a
child
that
had
*NL*
run
off
along
a
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
and
what
a
nice
face
he
has
!
''
said
the
prince
.
``
Why
do
n't
*NL*
you
go
up
to
him
?
He
wanted
to
speak
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
us
go
,
then
,
''
said
Kitty
,
turning
round
resolutely
.
``
How
are
*NL*
you
feeling
today
?
''
she
asked
Petrov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petrov
got
up
,
leaning
on
his
stick
,
and
looked
shyly
at
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
daughter
,
''
said
the
prince
.
``
Let
me
introduce
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
bowed
and
smiled
,
showing
his
strangely
dazzling
white
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
expected
you
yesterday
,
princess
,
''
he
said
to
Kitty
.
He
staggered
as
*NL*
he
said
this
,
and
then
repeated
the
motion
,
trying
to
make
it
seem
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
intentional
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
come
,
but
Varenka
said
that
Anna
Pavlovna
sent
word
you
were
*NL*
not
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
going
!
''
said
Petrov
,
blushing
,
and
immediately
beginning
to
cough
,
*NL*
and
his
eyes
sought
his
wife
.
``
Anita
!
Anita
!
''
he
said
loudly
,
and
the
*NL*
swollen
veins
stood
out
like
cords
on
his
thin
white
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
Pavlovna
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
sent
word
to
the
princess
that
we
were
n't
going
!
''
he
whispered
*NL*
to
her
angrily
,
losing
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
princess
,
''
said
Anna
Pavlovna
,
with
an
assumed
smile
*NL*
utterly
unlike
her
former
manner
.
``
Very
glad
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
the
prince
.
``
You
've
long
been
expected
,
prince
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
send
word
to
the
princess
that
we
were
n't
going
for
?
''
the
*NL*
artist
whispered
hoarsely
once
more
,
still
more
angrily
,
obviously
*NL*
exasperated
that
his
voice
failed
him
so
that
he
could
not
give
his
*NL*
words
the
expression
he
would
have
liked
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mercy
on
us
!
I
thought
we
were
n't
going
,
''
his
wife
answered
*NL*
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
when
...
''
He
coughed
and
waved
his
hand
.
The
prince
took
off
his
*NL*
hat
and
moved
away
with
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
ah
!
''
he
sighed
deeply
.
``
Oh
,
poor
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
papa
,
''
answered
Kitty
.
``
And
you
must
know
they
've
three
children
,
*NL*
no
servant
,
and
scarcely
any
means
.
He
gets
something
from
the
Academy
,
''
*NL*
she
went
on
briskly
,
trying
to
drown
the
distress
that
the
queer
change
*NL*
in
Anna
Pavlovna
's
manner
to
her
had
aroused
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
here
's
Madame
Stahl
,
''
said
Kitty
,
indicating
an
invalid
carriage
,
*NL*
where
,
propped
on
pillows
,
something
in
gray
and
blue
was
lying
under
a
*NL*
sunshade
.
This
was
Madame
Stahl
.
Behind
her
stood
the
gloomy
,
*NL*
healthy-looking
German
workman
who
pushed
the
carriage
.
Close
by
was
*NL*
standing
a
flaxen-headed
Swedish
count
,
whom
Kitty
knew
by
name
.
Several
*NL*
invalids
were
lingering
near
the
low
carriage
,
staring
at
the
lady
as
*NL*
though
she
were
some
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
went
up
to
her
,
and
Kitty
detected
that
disconcerting
gleam
*NL*
of
irony
in
his
eyes
.
He
went
up
to
Madame
Stahl
,
and
addressed
her
with
*NL*
extreme
courtesy
and
affability
in
that
excellent
French
that
so
few
*NL*
speak
nowadays
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
if
you
remember
me
,
but
I
must
recall
myself
to
thank
you
*NL*
for
your
kindness
to
my
daughter
,
''
he
said
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
not
*NL*
putting
it
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
Alexander
Shtcherbatsky
,
''
said
Madame
Stahl
,
lifting
upon
him
*NL*
her
heavenly
eyes
,
in
which
Kitty
discerned
a
look
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
``
Delighted
!
I
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
your
daughter

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
in
weak
health
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
'm
used
to
it
,
''
said
Madame
Stahl
,
and
she
introduced
the
prince
*NL*
to
the
Swedish
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
scarcely
changed
at
all
,

the
prince
said
to
her
.
``
It
's
ten
or
*NL*
eleven
years
since

had
the
honor
of
seeing
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
God
sends
the
cross
and
sends
the
strength

bear
it

Often
one
*NL*
wonders
what
is
the
goal
of
this
life
?

The
other
side
!
''
she
said
*NL*
angrily
to
Varenka
,
who
had
rearranged
the
rug
over
her
feet
not
to
her
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
do
good
,
probably
,

said
the
prince
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
for
us
to
judge
,
''
said
Madame
Stahl
,
perceiving
the
shade
*NL*
of
expression
on
the
prince
's
face
.
``
So
you
will
send
me
that
book
,
dear
*NL*
count
?
I
'm
very
grateful
to
you

she
said
to
the
young
Swede
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
the
prince
,
catching
sight
of
the
Moscow
colonel
standing
*NL*
near
,
and
with
a
bow
to
Madame
Stahl
he
walked
away
with
his
daughter
*NL*
and
the
Moscow
colonel
,
who
joined
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
our
aristocracy
,
prince
!
''
the
Moscow
colonel
said
with
ironical
*NL*
intention
.
He
cherished
a
grudge
against
Madame
Stahl
for
not
making
his
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
just
the
same
,
''
replied
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
her
before
her
illness
,
prince
--
that
's
to
say
before
she
*NL*
took
to
her
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
took
to
her
bed
before
my
eyes
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
it
's
ten
years
since
she
has
stood
on
her
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
stand
up
because
her
legs
are
too
short
.
She
's
a
very
bad
*NL*
figure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
,
it
's
not
possible
!
''
cried
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
wicked
tongues
say
,
my
darling
.
And
your
Varenka
catches
it
*NL*
too
,
''
he
added
.
``
Oh
,
these
invalid
ladies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
papa
!
''
Kitty
objected
warmly
.
``
Varenka
worships
her
.
And
then
*NL*
she
does
so
much
good
!
Ask
anyone
!
Everyone
knows
her
and
Aline
Stahl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
,
''
said
the
prince
,
squeezing
her
hand
with
his
elbow
;
``
but
*NL*
it
's
better
when
one
does
good
so
that
you
may
ask
everyone
and
no
one
*NL*
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
did
not
answer
,
not
because
she
had
nothing
to
say
,
but
because
*NL*
she
did
not
care
to
reveal
her
secret
thoughts
even
to
her
father
.
But
,
*NL*
strange
to
say
,
although
she
had
so
made
up
her
mind
not
to
be
*NL*
influenced
by
her
father
's
views
,
not
to
let
him
into
her
inmost
*NL*
sanctuary
,
she
felt
that
the
heavenly
image
of
Madame
Stahl
,
which
she
*NL*
had
carried
for
a
whole
month
in
her
heart
,
had
vanished
,
never
to
*NL*
return
,
just
as
the
fantastic
figure
made
up
of
some
clothes
thrown
down
*NL*
at
random
vanishes
when
one
sees
that
it
is
only
some
garment
lying
*NL*
there
.
All
that
was
left
was
a
woman
with
short
legs
,
who
lay
down
*NL*
because
she
had
a
bad
figure
,
and
worried
patient
Varenka
for
not
*NL*
arranging
her
rug
to
her
liking
.
And
by
no
effort
of
the
imagination
*NL*
could
Kitty
bring
back
the
former
Madame
Stahl
.

Chapter
35
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
prince
communicated
his
good
humor
to
his
own
family
and
his
*NL*
friends
,
and
even
to
the
German
landlord
in
whose
rooms
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
were
staying
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
back
with
Kitty
from
the
springs
,
the
prince
,
who
had
asked
*NL*
the
colonel
,
and
Marya
Yevgenyevna
,
and
Varenka
all
to
come
and
have
*NL*
coffee
with
them
,
gave
orders
for
a
table
and
chairs
to
be
taken
into
*NL*
the
garden
under
the
chestnut
tree
,
and
lunch
to
be
laid
there
.
The
*NL*
landlord
and
the
servants
,
too
,
grew
brisker
under
the
influence
of
his
*NL*
good
spirits
.
They
knew
his
open-handedness
;
and
half
an
hour
later
the
*NL*
invalid
doctor
from
Hamburg
,
who
lived
on
the
top
floor
,
looked
*NL*
enviously
out
of
the
window
at
the
merry
party
of
healthy
Russians
*NL*
assembled
under
the
chestnut
tree
.
In
the
trembling
circles
of
shadow
*NL*
cast
by
the
leaves
,
at
a
table
,
covered
with
a
white
cloth
,
and
set
with
*NL*
coffeepot
,
bread-and-butter
,
cheese
,
and
cold
game
,
sat
the
princess
in
*NL*
a
high
cap
with
lilac
ribbons
,
distributing
cups
and
bread-and-butter
.
*NL*
At
the
other
end
sat
the
prince
,
eating
heartily
,
and
talking
loudly
and
*NL*
merrily
.
The
prince
had
spread
out
near
him
his
purchases
,
carved
boxes
,
*NL*
and
knick-knacks
,
paper-knives
of
all
sorts
,
of
which
he
bought
a
heap
*NL*
at
every
watering-place
,
and
bestowed
them
upon
everyone
,
including
*NL*
Lieschen
,
the
servant
girl
,
and
the
landlord
,
with
whom
he
jested
in
his
*NL*
comically
bad
German
,
assuring
him
that
it
was
not
the
water
had
cured
*NL*
Kitty
,
but
his
splendid
cookery
,
especially
his
plum
soup
.
The
princess
*NL*
laughed
at
her
husband
for
his
Russian
ways
,
but
she
was
more
lively
and
*NL*
good-humored
than
she
had
been
all
the
while
she
had
been
at
the
waters
.
*NL*
The
colonel
smiled
,
as
he
always
did
,
at
the
prince
's
jokes
,
but
as
far
*NL*
as
regards
Europe
,
of
which
he
believed
himself
to
be
making
a
careful
*NL*
study
,
he
took
the
princess
's
side
.
The
simple-hearted
Marya
Yevgenyevna
*NL*
simply
roared
with
laughter
at
everything
absurd
the
prince
said
,
and
*NL*
his
jokes
made
Varenka
helpless
with
feeble
but
infectious
laughter
,
*NL*
which
was
something
Kitty
had
never
seen
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
glad
of
all
this
,
but
she
could
not
be
light-hearted
.
She
*NL*
could
not
solve
the
problem
her
father
had
unconsciously
set
her
by
his
*NL*
goodhumored
view
of
her
friends
,
and
of
the
life
that
had
so
attracted
*NL*
her
.
To
this
doubt
there
was
joined
the
change
in
her
relations
with
the
*NL*
Petrovs
,
which
had
been
so
conspicuously
and
unpleasantly
marked
that
*NL*
morning
.
Everyone
was
good
humored
,
but
Kitty
could
not
feel
good
*NL*
humored
,
and
this
increased
her
distress
.
She
felt
a
feeling
such
as
she
*NL*
had
known
in
childhood
,
when
she
had
been
shut
in
her
room
as
a
*NL*
punishment
,
and
had
heard
her
sisters
'
merry
laughter
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
what
did
you
buy
this
mass
of
things
for
?
''
said
the
princess
,
*NL*
smiling
,
and
handing
her
husband
a
cup
of
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
goes
for
a
walk
,
one
looks
in
a
shop
,
and
they
ask
you
to
buy
.
*NL*
'
_
Erlaucht
,
Durchlaucht
?
_
'
Directly
they
say
'
_
Durchlaucht
_
,
'
I
ca
n't
*NL*
hold
out
.
I
lose
ten
thalers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
simply
from
boredom
,
''
said
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
.
Such
boredom
,
my
dear
,
that
one
does
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
do
with
oneself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
bored
,
prince
?
There
's
so
much
that
's
interesting
now
in
*NL*
Germany
,
''
said
Marya
Yevgenyevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
everything
that
's
interesting
:
the
plum
soup
I
know
,
and
the
*NL*
pea
sausages
I
know
.
I
know
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
may
say
what
you
like
,
prince
,
there
's
the
interest
of
their
*NL*
institutions
,
''
said
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
there
interesting
about
it
?
They
're
all
as
pleased
as
brass
*NL*
halfpence

They
've
conquered
everybody
,
and
why
am
I
to
be
pleased
at
*NL*
that
?
I
have
n't
conquered
anyone
;
and
I
'm
obliged
to
take
off
my
own
*NL*
boots
,
yes
,
and
put
them
away
too
;
in
the
morning
,
get
up
and
dress
at
*NL*
once
,
and
go
to
the
dining
room
to
drink
bad
tea
!
How
different
it
is
at
*NL*
home
!
You
get
up
in
no
haste
,
you
get
cross
,
grumble
a
little
,
and
come
*NL*
round
again

You
've
time
to
think
things
over
,
and
no
hurry

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
time
's
money
,
you
forget
that
,
''
said
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Time
,
indeed
,
that
depends
!
Why
,
there
's
time
one
would
give
a
month
of
*NL*
for
sixpence
,
and
time
you
would
n't
give
half
an
hour
of
for
any
money
.
*NL*
Is
n't
that
so
,
Katinka
?
What
is
it
?
why
are
you
so
depressed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
depressed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
off
to
?
Stay
a
little
longer

he
said
to
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
going
home
,
''
said
Varenka
,
getting
up
,
and
again
she
went
off
*NL*
into
a
giggle
.
When
she
had
recovered
,
she
said
good-bye
,
and
went
into
*NL*
the
house
to
get
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
followed
her
.
Even
Varenka
struck
her
as
different
.
She
was
not
*NL*
worse
,
but
different
from
what
she
had
fancied
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
it
's
a
long
while
since
I
've
laughed
so
much

said
Varenka
,
*NL*
gathering
up
her
parasol
and
her
bag
.
``
How
nice
he
is

your
father

*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
shall
I
see
you
again

asked
Varenka

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
meant

said
Kitty

to
try
Varenka

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

answered
Varenka
.
``
They

Kitty

opening
her

wide

*NL*
clutching
at
Varenka
's
parasol
,
so
as
not
to
let
her
go

Kitty
assented

*NL*
``

smiling

Kitty
urged
impatiently

looking
darkly
at
Varenka

*NL*
``

Of

nonsense

dispute

over

sick
people

*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
,
scowling
more
than
ever
,
kept
silent
,
and
Varenka
went
on
*NL*
speaking
alone
,
trying
to
soften
or
soothe
her
,
and
seeing
a
storm
*NL*
coming
--
she
did
not
know
whether
of
tears
or
of
words

*NL*
*NL*
``
So

``
And

Kitty
cried
quickly
,
*NL*
snatching
the
parasol
out
of
Varenka
's
hand
,
and
looking
past
her
*NL*
friend
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
felt
inclined
to
smile
,
looking
at
her
childish
fury
,
but
she
*NL*
was
afraid
of
wounding
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
it
serve
you
right

I
do

understand

she
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves

right

because
it

not
from

What
business
had
I

interfere
with
*NL*
outsiders

it

come
about

Varenka
gently

*NL*
``

opening

shutting
the
parasol

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

Kitty
was
in

asked
Varenka
in
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything

I
ca
n't
act
except
from
the
heart

and
you
act
from

principle

I
liked
you
simply

but
you
most
likely
only
wanted
to
save
*NL*
me
,
to
improve
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
unjust

''
said
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
not
speaking
of
other
people
,
I
'm
speaking
of
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
''
they
heard
her
mother
's
voice
,
``
come
here
,
show
papa
your
*NL*
necklace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
,
with
a
haughty
air
,
without
making
peace
with
her
friend
,
took
*NL*
the
necklace
in
a
little
box
from
the
table
and
went
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
Why
are
you
so
red
?
''
her
mother
and
father
said
to
*NL*
her
with
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
'll
be
back
directly
,
''
and
she
ran
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
still
here
,
''
she
thought
.
``
What
am
I
to
say
to
her
?
Oh
,
dear
!
*NL*
what
have
I
done
,
what
have
I
said
?
Why
was
I
rude
to
her
?
What
am
I
to
*NL*
do
?
What
am
I
to
say
to
her
?
''
thought
Kitty
,
and
she
stopped
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
in
her
hat
and
with
the
parasol
in
her
hands
was
sitting
at
the
*NL*
table
examining
the
spring
which
Kitty
had
broken
.
She
lifted
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varenka
,
forgive
me
,
do
forgive
me
,
''
whispered
Kitty
,
going
up
to
her
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
what
I
said
.
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
did
n't
mean
to
hurt
you
,
''
said
Varenka
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Peace
was
made
.
But
with
her
father
's
coming
all
the
world
in
which
she
*NL*
had
been
living
was
transformed
for
Kitty
.
She
did
not
give
up
*NL*
everything
she
had
learned
,
but
she
became
aware
that
she
had
deceived
*NL*
herself
in
supposing
she
could
be
what
she
wanted
to
be
.
Her
eyes
were
,
*NL*
it
seemed
,
opened
;
she
felt
all
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
herself
*NL*
without
hypocrisy
and
self-conceit
on
the
pinnacle
to
which
she
had
*NL*
wished
to
mount
.
Moreover
,
she
became
aware
of
all
the
dreariness
of
the
*NL*
world
of
sorrow
,
of
sick
and
dying
people
,
in
which
she
had
been
living
.
*NL*
The
efforts
she
had
made
to
like
it
seemed
to
her
intolerable
,
and
she
*NL*
felt
a
longing
to
get
back
quickly
into
the
fresh
air
,
to
Russia
,
to
*NL*
Ergushovo
,
where
,
as
she
knew
from
letters
,
her
sister
Dolly
had
already
*NL*
gone
with
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
her
affection
for
Varenka
did
not
wane
.
As
she
said
good-bye
,
Kitty
*NL*
begged
her
to
come
to
them
in
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
when
you
get
married
,
''
said
Varenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
shall
never
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
shall
be
married
simply
for
that
.
Mind
now
,
remember
your
*NL*
promise
,
''
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
's
prediction
was
fulfilled
.
Kitty
returned
home
to
Russia
*NL*
cured
.
She
was
not
so
gay
and
thoughtless
as
before
,
but
she
was
serene
.
*NL*
Her
Moscow
troubles
had
become
a
memory

PART

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
Koznishev
wanted
a
rest
from
mental
work
,
and
instead
*NL*
of
going
abroad
as
he
usually
did
,
he
came
towards
the
end
of
May
to
*NL*
stay
in
the
country
with
his
brother
.
In
his
judgment
the
best
sort
of
*NL*
life
was
a
country
life
.
He
had
come
now
to
enjoy
such
a
life
at
his
*NL*
brother
's
.
Konstantin
Levin
was
very
glad
to
have
him
,
especially
as
he
*NL*
did
not
expect
his
brother
Nikolay
that
summer
.
But
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
affection
and
respect
for
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
Konstantin
Levin
was
*NL*
uncomfortable
with
his
brother
in
the
country
.
It
made
him
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
and
it
positively
annoyed
him
to
see
his
brother
's
*NL*
attitude
to
the
country
.
To
Konstantin
Levin
the
country
was
the
*NL*
background
of
life
,
that
is
of
pleasures
,
endeavors
,
labor
.
To
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
the
country
meant
on
one
hand
rest
from
work
,
on
the
other
a
*NL*
valuable
antidote
to
the
corrupt
influences
of
town
,
which
he
took
with
*NL*
satisfaction
and
a
sense
of
its
utility
.
To
Konstantin
Levin
the
country
*NL*
was
good
first
because
it
afforded
a
field
for
labor
,
of
the
usefulness
*NL*
of
which
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
To
Sergey
Ivanovitch
the
country
was
*NL*
particularly
good
,
because
there
it
was
possible
and
fitting
to
do
*NL*
nothing
.
Moreover
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
attitude
to
the
peasants
rather
*NL*
piqued
Konstantin
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
used
to
say
that
he
knew
and
liked
*NL*
the
peasantry
,
and
he
often
talked
to
the
peasants
,
which
he
knew
how
to
*NL*
do
without
affectation
or
condescension
,
and
from
every
such
*NL*
conversation
he
would
deduce
general
conclusions
in
favor
of
the
*NL*
peasantry
and
in
confirmation
of
his
knowing
them
.
Konstantin
Levin
did
*NL*
not
like
such
an
attitude
to
the
peasants
.
To
Konstantin
the
peasant
was
*NL*
simply
the
chief
partner
in
their
common
labor
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
respect
and
the
love
,
almost
like
that
of
kinship
,
he
had
for
the
*NL*
peasant
--
sucked
in
probably
,
as
he
said
himself
,
with
the
milk
of
his
*NL*
peasant
nurse
--
still
as
a
fellow-worker
with
him
,
while
sometimes
*NL*
enthusiastic
over
the
vigor
,
gentleness
,
and
justice
of
these
men
,
he
*NL*
was
very
often
,
when
their
common
labors
called
for
other
qualities
,
*NL*
exasperated
with
the
peasant
for
his
carelessness
,
lack
of
method
,
*NL*
drunkenness
,
and
lying
.
If
he
had
been
asked
whether
he
liked
or
did
n't
*NL*
like
the
peasants
,
Konstantin
Levin
would
have
been
absolutely
at
a
loss
*NL*
what
to
reply
.
He
liked
and
did
not
like
the
peasants
,
just
as
he
liked
*NL*
and
did
not
like
men
in
general
.
Of
course
,
being
a
good-hearted
man
,
he
*NL*
liked
men
rather
than
he
disliked
them
,
and
so
too
with
the
peasants
.
*NL*
But
like
or
dislike
``
the
people
''
as
something
apart
he
could
not
,
not
*NL*
only
because
he
lived
with
``
the
people
,
''
and
all
his
interests
were
*NL*
bound
up
with
theirs
,
but
also
because
he
regarded
himself
as
a
part
of
*NL*
``
the
people
,
''
did
not
see
any
special
qualities
or
failings
*NL*
distinguishing
himself
and
``
the
people
,
''
and
could
not
contrast
himself
*NL*
with
them
.
Moreover
,
although
he
had
lived
so
long
in
the
closest
*NL*
relations
with
the
peasants
,
as
farmer
and
arbitrator
,
and
what
was
*NL*
more
,
as
adviser
-LRB-
the
peasants
trusted
him
,
and
for
thirty
miles
round
*NL*
they
would
come
to
ask
his
advice
-RRB-
,
he
had
no
definite
views
of
``
the
*NL*
people
,
''
and
would
have
been
as
much
at
a
loss
to
answer
the
question
*NL*
whether
he
knew
``
the
people
''
as
the
question
whether
he
liked
them
.
For
*NL*
him
to
say
he
knew
the
peasantry
would
have
been
the
same
as
to
say
he
*NL*
knew
men
.
He
was
continually
watching
and
getting
to
know
people
of
all
*NL*
sorts
,
and
among
them
peasants
,
whom
he
regarded
as
good
and
interesting
*NL*
people
,
and
he
was
continually
observing
new
points
in
them
,
altering
*NL*
his
former
views
of
them
and
forming
new
ones
.
With
Sergey
Ivanovitch
it
*NL*
was
quite
the
contrary
.
Just
as
he
liked
and
praised
a
country
life
in
*NL*
comparison
with
the
life
he
did
not
like
,
so
too
he
liked
the
peasantry
*NL*
in
contradistinction
to
the
class
of
men
he
did
not
like
,
and
so
too
he
*NL*
knew
the
peasantry
as
something
distinct
from
and
opposed
to
men
*NL*
generally
.
In
his
methodical
brain
there
were
distinctly
formulated
*NL*
certain
aspects
of
peasant
life
,
deduced
partly
from
that
life
itself
,
*NL*
but
chiefly
from
contrast
with
other
modes
of
life
.
He
never
changed
his
*NL*
opinion
of
the
peasantry
and
his
sympathetic
attitude
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
discussions
that
arose
between
the
brothers
on
their
views
of
the
*NL*
peasantry
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
always
got
the
better
of
his
brother
,
*NL*
precisely
because
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
definite
ideas
about
the
*NL*
peasant
--
his
character
,
his
qualities
,
and
his
tastes
.
Konstantin
Levin
*NL*
had
no
definite
and
unalterable
idea
on
the
subject
,
and
so
in
their
*NL*
arguments
Konstantin
was
readily
convicted
of
contradicting
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
eyes
his
younger
brother
was
a
capital
fellow
,
*NL*
_
with
his
heart
in
the
right
place
_
-LRB-
as
he
expressed
it
in
French
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
with
a
mind
which
,
though
fairly
quick
,
was
too
much
influenced
by
the
*NL*
impressions
of
the
moment
,
and
consequently
filled
with
contradictions
.
*NL*
With
all
the
condescension
of
an
elder
brother
he
sometimes
explained
to
*NL*
him
the
true
import
of
things
,
but
he
derived
little
satisfaction
from
*NL*
arguing
with
him
because
he
got
the
better
of
him
too
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
regarded
his
brother
as
a
man
of
immense
intellect
and
*NL*
culture
,
as
generous
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
,
and
possessed
of
*NL*
a
special
faculty
for
working
for
the
public
good
.
But
in
the
depths
of
*NL*
his
heart
,
the
older
he
became
,
and
the
more
intimately
he
knew
his
*NL*
brother
,
the
more
and
more
frequently
the
thought
struck
him
that
this
*NL*
faculty
of
working
for
the
public
good
,
of
which
he
felt
himself
utterly
*NL*
devoid
,
was
possibly
not
so
much
a
quality
as
a
lack
of
something
--
not
a
*NL*
lack
of
good
,
honest
,
noble
desires
and
tastes
,
but
a
lack
of
vital
*NL*
force
,
of
what
is
called
heart
,
of
that
impulse
which
drives
a
man
to
*NL*
choose
someone
out
of
the
innumerable
paths
of
life
,
and
to
care
only
*NL*
for
that
one
.
The
better
he
knew
his
brother
,
the
more
he
noticed
that
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
many
other
people
who
worked
for
the
public
*NL*
welfare
,
were
not
led
by
an
impulse
of
the
heart
to
care
for
the
public
*NL*
good
,
but
reasoned
from
intellectual
considerations
that
it
was
a
right
*NL*
thing
to
take
interest
in
public
affairs
,
and
consequently
took
interest
*NL*
in
them
.
Levin
was
confirmed
in
this
generalization
by
observing
that
*NL*
his
brother
did
not
take
questions
affecting
the
public
welfare
or
the
*NL*
question
of
the
immortality
of
the
soul
a
bit
more
to
heart
than
he
did
*NL*
chess
problems
,
or
the
ingenious
construction
of
a
new
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
Konstantin
Levin
was
not
at
his
ease
with
his
brother
,
*NL*
because
in
summer
in
the
country
Levin
was
continually
busy
with
work
on
*NL*
the
land
,
and
the
long
summer
day
was
not
long
enough
for
him
to
get
*NL*
through
all
he
had
to
do
,
while
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
taking
a
holiday
.
*NL*
But
though
he
was
taking
a
holiday
now
,
that
is
to
say
,
he
was
doing
no
*NL*
writing
,
he
was
so
used
to
intellectual
activity
that
he
liked
to
put
*NL*
into
concise
and
eloquent
shape
the
ideas
that
occurred
to
him
,
and
*NL*
liked
to
have
someone
to
listen
to
him
.
His
most
usual
and
natural
*NL*
listener
was
his
brother
.
And
so
in
spite
of
the
friendliness
and
*NL*
directness
of
their
relations
,
Konstantin
felt
an
awkwardness
in
leaving
*NL*
him
alone
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
liked
to
stretch
himself
on
the
grass
in
*NL*
the
sun
,
and
to
lie
so
,
basking
and
chatting
lazily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe
,
''
he
would
say
to
his
brother
,
``
what
a
pleasure
*NL*
this
rural
laziness
is
to
me
.
Not
an
idea
in
one
's
brain
,
as
empty
as
a
*NL*
drum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Konstantin
Levin
found
it
dull
sitting
and
listening
to
him
,
*NL*
especially
when
he
knew
that
while
he
was
away
they
would
be
carting
*NL*
dung
onto
the
fields
not
ploughed
ready
for
it
,
and
heaping
it
all
up
*NL*
anyhow
;
and
would
not
screw
the
shares
in
the
ploughs
,
but
would
let
*NL*
them
come
off
and
then
say
that
the
new
ploughs
were
a
silly
invention
,
*NL*
and
there
was
nothing
like
the
old
Andreevna
plough
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
've
done
enough
trudging
about
in
the
heat
,
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
would
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
must
just
run
round
to
the
counting-house
for
a
minute
,
''
Levin
*NL*
would
answer
,
and
he
would
run
off
to
the
fields
.

Chapter
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
June
it
happened
that
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
the
old
nurse
and
*NL*
housekeeper
,
in
carrying
to
the
cellar
a
jar
of
mushrooms
she
had
just
*NL*
pickled
,
slipped
,
fell
,
and
sprained
her
wrist
.
The
district
doctor
,
a
*NL*
talkative
young
medical
student
,
who
had
just
finished
his
studies
,
came
*NL*
to
see
her
.
He
examined
the
wrist
,
said
it
was
not
broken
,
was
delighted
*NL*
at
a
chance
of
talking
to
the
celebrated
Sergey
Ivanovitch
Koznishev
,
*NL*
and
to
show
his
advanced
views
of
things
told
him
all
the
scandal
of
the
*NL*
district
,
complaining
of
the
poor
state
into
which
the
district
council
*NL*
had
fallen
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
listened
attentively
,
asked
him
questions
,
*NL*
and
,
roused
by
a
new
listener
,
he
talked
fluently
,
uttered
a
few
keen
*NL*
and
weighty
observations
,
respectfully
appreciated
by
the
young
doctor
,
*NL*
and
was
soon
in
that
eager
frame
of
mind
his
brother
knew
so
well
,
which
*NL*
always
,
with
him
,
followed
a
brilliant
and
eager
conversation
.
After
the
*NL*
departure
of
the
doctor
,
he
wanted
to
go
with
a
fishing
rod
to
the
*NL*
river
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
fond
of
angling
,
and
was
,
it
seemed
,
proud
*NL*
of
being
able
to
care
for
such
a
stupid
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
,
whose
presence
was
needed
in
the
plough
land
and
*NL*
meadows
,
had
come
to
take
his
brother
in
the
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
that
time
of
the
year
,
the
turning-point
of
summer
,
when
the
*NL*
crops
of
the
present
year
are
a
certainty
,
when
one
begins
to
think
of
*NL*
the
sowing
for
next
year
,
and
the
mowing
is
at
hand
;
when
the
rye
is
all
*NL*
in
ear
,
though
its
ears
are
still
light
,
not
yet
full
,
and
it
waves
in
*NL*
gray-green
billows
in
the
wind
;
when
the
green
oats
,
with
tufts
of
*NL*
yellow
grass
scattered
here
and
there
among
it
,
droop
irregularly
over
*NL*
the
late-sown
fields
;
when
the
early
buckwheat
is
already
out
and
hiding
*NL*
the
ground
;
when
the
fallow
lands
,
trodden
hard
as
stone
by
the
cattle
,
*NL*
are
half
ploughed
over
,
with
paths
left
untouched
by
the
plough
;
when
*NL*
from
the
dry
dung-heaps
carted
onto
the
fields
there
comes
at
sunset
a
*NL*
smell
of
manure
mixed
with
meadow-sweet
,
and
on
the
low-lying
lands
the
*NL*
riverside
meadows
are
a
thick
sea
of
grass
waiting
for
the
mowing
,
with
*NL*
blackened
heaps
of
the
stalks
of
sorrel
among
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
time
when
there
comes
a
brief
pause
in
the
toil
of
the
fields
*NL*
before
the
beginning
of
the
labors
of
harvest
--
every
year
recurring
,
*NL*
every
year
straining
every
nerve
of
the
peasants
.
The
crop
was
a
*NL*
splendid
one
,
and
bright
,
hot
summer
days
had
set
in
with
short
,
dewy
*NL*
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brothers
had
to
drive
through
the
woods
to
reach
the
meadows
.
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
was
all
the
while
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
woods
,
which
*NL*
were
a
tangled
mass
of
leaves
,
pointing
out
to
his
brother
now
an
old
*NL*
lime
tree
on
the
point
of
flowering
,
dark
on
the
shady
side
,
and
*NL*
brightly
spotted
with
yellow
stipules
,
now
the
young
shoots
of
this
*NL*
year
's
saplings
brilliant
with
emerald
.
Konstantin
Levin
did
not
like
*NL*
talking
and
hearing
about
the
beauty
of
nature
.
Words
for
him
took
away
*NL*
the
beauty
of
what
he
saw
.
He
assented
to
what
his
brother
said
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
help
beginning
to
think
of
other
things
.
When
they
came
out
of
*NL*
the
woods
,
all
his
attention
was
engrossed
by
the
view
of
the
fallow
*NL*
land
on
the
upland
,
in
parts
yellow
with
grass
,
in
parts
trampled
and
*NL*
checkered
with
furrows
,
in
parts
dotted
with
ridges
of
dung
,
and
in
*NL*
parts
even
ploughed
.
A
string
of
carts
was
moving
across
it
.
Levin
*NL*
counted
the
carts
,
and
was
pleased
that
all
that
were
wanted
had
been
*NL*
brought
,
and
at
the
sight
of
the
meadows
his
thoughts
passed
to
the
*NL*
mowing
.
He
always
felt
something
special
moving
him
to
the
quick
at
the
*NL*
hay-making
.
On
reaching
the
meadow
Levin
stopped
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
dew
was
still
lying
on
the
thick
undergrowth
of
the
grass
,
*NL*
and
that
he
might
not
get
his
feet
wet
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
asked
his
*NL*
brother
to
drive
him
in
the
trap
up
to
the
willow
tree
from
which
the
*NL*
carp
was
caught
.
Sorry
as
Konstantin
Levin
was
to
crush
down
his
mowing
*NL*
grass
,
he
drove
him
into
the
meadow
.
The
high
grass
softly
turned
about
*NL*
the
wheels
and
the
horse
's
legs
,
leaving
its
seeds
clinging
to
the
wet
*NL*
axles
and
spokes
of
the
wheels
.
His
brother
seated
himself
under
a
bush
,
*NL*
arranging
his
tackle
,
while
Levin
led
the
horse
away
,
fastened
him
up
,
*NL*
and
walked
into
the
vast
gray-green
sea
of
grass
unstirred
by
the
wind
.
*NL*
The
silky
grass
with
its
ripe
seeds
came
almost
to
his
waist
in
the
*NL*
dampest
spots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crossing
the
meadow
,
Konstantin
Levin
came
out
onto
the
road
,
and
met
an
*NL*
old
man
with
a
swollen
eye
,
carrying
a
skep
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
taken
a
stray
swarm
,
Fomitch
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
Konstantin
Dmitrich
!
All
we
can
do
to
keep
our
own
!
This
is
*NL*
the
second
swarm
that
has
flown
away
...
Luckily
the
lads
caught
them
.
*NL*
They
were
ploughing
your
field
.
They
unyoked
the
horses
and
galloped
*NL*
after
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
,
Fomitch
--
start
mowing
or
wait
a
bit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
well
.
Our
way
's
to
wait
till
St.
Peter
's
Day
.
But
you
always
mow
*NL*
sooner
.
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
please
God
,
the
hay
's
good
.
There
'll
be
plenty
*NL*
for
the
beasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
about
the
weather
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
in
God
's
hands
.
Maybe
it
will
be
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
up
to
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
caught
nothing
,
but
he
was
not
bored
,
and
seemed
*NL*
in
the
most
cheerful
frame
of
mind
.
Levin
saw
that
,
stimulated
by
his
*NL*
conversation
with
the
doctor
,
he
wanted
to
talk
.
Levin
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
would
have
liked
to
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
to
give
orders
*NL*
about
getting
together
the
mowers
for
next
day
,
and
to
set
at
rest
his
*NL*
doubts
about
the
mowing
,
which
greatly
absorbed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
be
going
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
be
in
such
a
hurry
?
Let
's
stay
a
little
.
But
how
wet
you
are
!
Even
*NL*
though
one
catches
nothing
,
it
's
nice
.
That
's
the
best
thing
about
every
*NL*
part
of
sport
,
that
one
has
to
do
with
nature
.
How
exquisite
this
steely
*NL*
water
is
!
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
These
riverside
banks
always
remind
*NL*
me
of
the
riddle
--
do
you
know
it
?
`
The
grass
says
to
the
water
:
we
*NL*
quiver
and
we
quiver
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
the
riddle
,
''
answered
Levin
wearily
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
've
been
thinking
about
you
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
``
It
's
beyond
everything
what
's
being
done
in
the
district
,
according
to
*NL*
what
this
doctor
tells
me
.
He
's
a
very
intelligent
fellow
.
And
as
I
've
*NL*
told
you
before
,
I
tell
you
again
:
it
's
not
right
for
you
not
to
go
to
*NL*
the
meetings
,
and
altogether
to
keep
out
of
the
district
business
.
If
*NL*
decent
people
wo
n't
go
into
it
,
of
course
it
's
bound
to
go
all
wrong
.
We
*NL*
pay
the
money
,
and
it
all
goes
in
salaries
,
and
there
are
no
schools
,
*NL*
nor
district
nurses
,
nor
midwives
,
nor
drugstores
--
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
try
,
you
know
,
''
Levin
said
slowly
and
unwillingly
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
!
and
so
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
ca
n't
you
?
I
must
own
I
ca
n't
make
it
out
.
Indifference
,
*NL*
incapacity
--
I
wo
n't
admit
;
surely
it
's
not
simply
laziness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
those
things
.
I
've
tried
,
and
I
see
I
can
do
nothing
,
''
said
*NL*
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
grasped
what
his
brother
was
saying
.
Looking
towards
the
*NL*
plough
land
across
the
river
,
he
made
out
something
black
,
but
he
could
*NL*
not
distinguish
whether
it
was
a
horse
or
the
bailiff
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
you
can
do
nothing
?
You
made
an
attempt
and
did
n't
succeed
,
*NL*
as
you
think
,
and
you
give
in
.
How
can
you
have
so
little
self-respect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Self-respect
!
''
said
Levin
,
stung
to
the
quick
by
his
brother
's
words
;
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
If
they
'd
told
me
at
college
that
other
people
*NL*
understood
the
integral
calculus
,
and
I
did
n't
,
then
pride
would
have
*NL*
come
in
.
But
in
this
case
one
wants
first
to
be
convinced
that
one
has
*NL*
certain
qualifications
for
this
sort
of
business
,
and
especially
that
*NL*
all
this
business
is
of
great
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
do
you
mean
to
say
it
's
not
of
importance
?
''
said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
stung
to
the
quick
too
at
his
brother
's
considering
anything
*NL*
of
no
importance
that
interested
him
,
and
still
more
at
his
obviously
*NL*
paying
little
attention
to
what
he
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
important
;
it
does
not
take
hold
of
me
,
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
it
,
''
answered
Levin
,
making
out
that
what
he
saw
was
the
bailiff
,
and
*NL*
that
the
bailiff
seemed
to
be
letting
the
peasants
go
off
the
ploughed
*NL*
land
.
They
were
turning
the
plough
over
.
``
Can
they
have
finished
*NL*
ploughing
?
''
he
wondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
really
though
,
''
said
the
elder
brother
,
with
a
frown
on
his
*NL*
handsome
,
clever
face
,
``
there
's
a
limit
to
everything
.
It
's
very
well
to
*NL*
be
original
and
genuine
,
and
to
dislike
everything
conventional
--
I
know
*NL*
all
about
that
;
but
really
,
what
you
're
saying
either
has
no
meaning
,
or
*NL*
it
has
a
very
wrong
meaning
.
How
can
you
think
it
a
matter
of
no
*NL*
importance
whether
the
peasant
,
whom
you
love
as
you
assert
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
did
assert
it
,
''
thought
Konstantin
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
dies
without
help
?
The
ignorant
peasant-women
starve
the
children
,
*NL*
and
the
people
stagnate
in
darkness
,
and
are
helpless
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
every
village
clerk
,
while
you
have
at
your
disposal
a
means
of
helping
*NL*
them
,
and
do
n't
help
them
because
to
your
mind
it
's
of
no
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Sergey
Ivanovitch
put
before
him
the
alternative
:
either
you
are
so
*NL*
undeveloped
that
you
ca
n't
see
all
that
you
can
do
,
or
you
wo
n't
*NL*
sacrifice
your
ease
,
your
vanity
,
or
whatever
it
is
,
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
felt
that
there
was
no
course
open
to
him
but
to
*NL*
submit
,
or
to
confess
to
a
lack
of
zeal
for
the
public
good
.
And
this
*NL*
mortified
him
and
hurt
his
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
both
,
''
he
said
resolutely
:
``
I
do
n't
see
that
it
was
possible
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
was
it
impossible
,
if
the
money
were
properly
laid
out
,
to
*NL*
provide
medical
aid

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
,
as
it
seems
to
me

For
the
three
thousand
square
miles
*NL*
of
our
district
,
what
with
our
thaws
,
and
the
storms
,
and
the
work
in
*NL*
the
fields
,
I
do
n't
see
how
it
is
possible
to
provide
medical
aid
all
*NL*
over
.
And
besides
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
medicine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
that
's
unfair
...
I
can
quote
to
you
thousands
of
*NL*
instances

But
the
schools
,
anyway

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
schools
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

Can
there
be
two
opinions

the
advantage

education

a
good
thing
for
you

it
's
a
good
thing
for

everyone

''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
felt
himself
morally
pinned
against
a
wall
,
and
so
he
*NL*
got
hot
,
and
unconsciously
blurted
out
the
chief
cause
of
his
*NL*
indifference
to
public
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
may
all
be
very
good
;
but
why
should
I
worry
myself
about
*NL*
establishing
dispensaries
which
I
shall
never
make
use
of
,
and
schools
*NL*
to
which
I
shall
never
send
my
children
,
to
which
even
the
peasants
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
send
their
children
,
and
to
which
I
've
no
very
firm
faith
*NL*
that
they
ought
to
send
them
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
for
a
minute
surprised
at
this
unexpected
view
of
*NL*
the
subject
;
but
he
promptly
made
a
new
plan
of
attack
.
He
was
silent
*NL*
for
a
little
,
drew
out
a
hook
,
threw
it
in
again
,
and
turned
to
his
*NL*
brother
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
...
In
the
first
place
,
the
dispensary
is
needed

We

ourselves
sent

doctor
for
Agafea
Mihalovna

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
fancy
her
wrist
will
never
be
straight
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
remains
to
be
proved

Next
,
the
peasant
who
can
read
and
write
*NL*
is
as
a

more
use
and
value
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

you
can
ask
anyone
you
like

Konstantin
Levin
answered
with
*NL*
decision
,
``
the
man
that
can
read
and
write

much
inferior
as

And
mending

an
impossibility

soon
as
*NL*
they
put
up
bridges
they
're
stolen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
that
's
not
the
point
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
frowning
.
He
*NL*
disliked
contradiction
,
and
still
more
,
arguments
that
were
continually
*NL*
skipping
from
one
thing
to
another
,
introducing
new
and
disconnected
*NL*
points
,
so
that
there
was
no
knowing
to
which
to
reply
.
``
Do
you
admit
*NL*
that
education
is
a
benefit
for
the
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
admit
it
,
''
said
Levin
without
thinking
,
and
he
was
conscious
*NL*
immediately
that
he
had
said
what
he
did
not
think
.
He
felt
that
if
he
*NL*
admitted
that
,
it
would
be
proved
that
he
had
been
talking
meaningless
*NL*
rubbish
.
How
it
would
be
proved
he
could
not
tell
,
but
he
knew
that
this
*NL*
would
inevitably
be
logically
proved
to
him
,
and
he
awaited
the
proofs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
argument
turned
out
to
be
far
simpler
than
he
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
admit
that
it
is
a
benefit
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
``
then
,
as
*NL*
an
honest
man
,
you
can
not
help
caring
about
it
and
sympathizing
with
the
*NL*
movement
,
and
so
wishing
to
work
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
still
do
not
admit
this
movement
to
be
just
,
''
said
Konstantin
*NL*
Levin
,
reddening
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
But
you
said
just
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
to
say
,
I
do
n't
admit
it
's
being
either
good
or
possible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
ca
n't
tell
without
making
the
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
supposing
that
's
so
,
''
said
Levin
,
though
he
did
not
suppose
so
at
*NL*
all
,
``
supposing
that
is
so
,
still
I
do
n't
see
,
all
the
same
,
what
I
'm
to
*NL*
worry
myself
about
it
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
since
we
are
talking
,
explain
it
to
me
from
the
philosophical
point
*NL*
of
view
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
where
philosophy
comes
in
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
in
a
*NL*
tone
,
Levin
fancied
,
as
though
he
did
not
admit
his
brother
's
right
to
*NL*
talk
about
philosophy
.
And
that
irritated
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
then
,
''
he
said
with
heat
,
``
I
imagine
the
mainspring
of
*NL*
all
our
actions
is
,
after
all
,
self-interest
.
Now
in
the
local
*NL*
institutions
I
,
as
a
nobleman
,
see
nothing
that
could
conduce
to
my
*NL*
prosperity
,
and
the
roads
are
not
better
and
could
not
be
better
;
my
*NL*
horses
carry
me
well
enough
over
bad
ones
.
Doctors
and
dispensaries
are
*NL*
no
use
to
me
.
An
arbitrator
of
disputes
is
no
use
to
me
.
I
never
appeal
*NL*
to
him
,
and
never
shall
appeal
to
him
.
The
schools
are
no
good
to
me
,
*NL*
but
positively
harmful
,
as
I
told
you
.
For
me
the
district
institutions
*NL*
simply
mean
the
liability
to
pay
fourpence
halfpenny
for
every
three
*NL*
acres
,
to
drive
into
the
town
,
sleep
with
bugs
,
and
listen
to
all
sorts
*NL*
of
idiocy
and
loathsomeness
,
and
self-interest
offers
me
no
inducement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
interposed
with
a
smile
,
``
self-interest
*NL*
did
not
induce
us
to
work
for
the
emancipation
of
the
serfs
,
but
we
did
*NL*
work
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
Konstantin
Levin
broke
in
with
still
greater
heat
;
``
the
*NL*
emancipation
of
the
serfs
was
a
different
matter
.
There
self-interest
*NL*
did
come
in
.
One
longed
to
throw
off
that
yoke
that
crushed
us
,
all
*NL*
decent
people
among
us
.
But
to
be
a
town
councilor

discuss
how
many
*NL*

are
needed
,
and
how
chimneys
shall
be
constructed
in
the
town
in
*NL*
which
I
do
n't
live

to
serve
on
a
jury
and
try
a
peasant
who
's
stolen
a
*NL*
flitch
of
bacon
,
and
listen
for
six
hours
at
a
stretch
to
all
sorts
of
*NL*
jabber
from
the
counsel
for
the
defense

the
prosecution

and
the
*NL*
president
cross-examining
my
old
half-witted
Alioshka

you

*NL*
prisoner
in

fact

the
removal

Eh
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
had
warmed
to
his
subject
,
and
began
mimicking
the
*NL*
president
and
the
half-witted
Alioshka
:
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
all
*NL*
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sergey
Ivanovitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
mean
to
say
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
simply
mean

those

my

I
*NL*
shall
always
defend

the
best
of
my
ability

that
when
they
made

I
was
ready

am
ready

deliberate
on

deliberating
on

forty
thousand
roubles

''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
Levin
spoke
as
though
the
floodgates
of
his
speech
had
burst
*NL*
open
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tomorrow
it
'll
be
your
turn
to
be

would
it

suited
your

old
criminal
tribunal

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

no

it

Well
,
I
tell
you
what
,
''
he
went
on
,
flying
off
again
to
a
subject
*NL*
quite
beside
the
point
,
``
our
district
self-government
and
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
it
--
it
's
just
like
the
birch
branches
we
stick
in
the
ground
on
*NL*
Trinity
Day
,
for
instance
,
to
look
like
a
copse
which
has
grown
up
of
*NL*
itself
in
Europe
,
and
I
ca
n't
gush
over
these
birch
branches
and
believe
*NL*
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
as
though
to
express
*NL*
his
wonder
how
the
birch
branches
had
come
into
their
argument
at
that
*NL*
point
,
though
he
did
really
understand
at
once
what
his
brother
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
but
you
know
one
really
ca
n't
argue
in
that
way
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Konstantin
Levin
wanted
to
justify
himself
for
the
failing
,
of
which
*NL*
he
was
conscious
,
of
lack
of
zeal
for
the
public
welfare
,
and
he
went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
no
sort
of
activity
is
likely
to
be
lasting
*NL*
if
it
is
not
founded
on
self-interest
,
that
's
a
universal
principle
,
a
*NL*
philosophical
principle
,
''
he
said
,
repeating
the
word
``
philosophical
''
*NL*
with
determination
,
as
though
wishing
to
show
that
he
had
as
much
right
*NL*
as
any
one
else
to
talk
of
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
smiled
.
``
He
too
has
a
philosophy
of
his
own
at
the
*NL*
service
of
his
natural
tendencies
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
'd
better
let
philosophy
alone
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
chief
problem
*NL*
of
the
philosophy
of
all
ages
consists
just
in
finding
the
indispensable
*NL*
connection
which
exists
between
individual
and
social
interests
.
But
*NL*
that
's
not
to
the
point
;
what
is
to
the
point
is
a
correction
I
must
*NL*
make
in
your
comparison
.
The
birches
are
not
simply
stuck
in
,
but
some
*NL*
are
sown
and
some
are
planted
,
and
one
must
deal
carefully
with
them
.
*NL*
It
's
only
those
peoples
that
have
an
intuitive
sense
of
what
's
of
*NL*
importance
and
significance
in
their
institutions
,
and
know
how
to
value
*NL*
them
,
that
have
a
future
before
them
--
it
's
only
those
peoples
that
one
*NL*
can
truly
call
historical
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Sergey
Ivanovitch
carried
the
subject
into
the
regions
of
*NL*
philosophical
history
where
Konstantin
Levin
could
not
follow
him
,
and
*NL*
showed
him
all
the
incorrectness
of
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
your
dislike
of
it
,
excuse
my
saying
so
,
that
's
simply
our
*NL*
Russian
sloth
and
old
serf-owner
's
ways
,
and
I
'm
convinced
that
in
you
*NL*
it
's
a
temporary
error
and
will
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Konstantin
was
silent
.
He
felt
himself
vanquished
on
all
sides
,
but
he
*NL*
felt
at
the
same
time
that
what
he
wanted
to
say
was
unintelligible
to
*NL*
his
brother
.
Only
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
was
*NL*
unintelligible
because
he
was
not
capable
of
expressing
his
meaning
*NL*
clearly
,
or
because
his
brother
would
not
or
could
not
understand
him
.
*NL*
But
he
did
not
pursue
the
speculation
,
and
without
replying
,
he
fell
to
*NL*
musing
on
a
quite
different
and
personal
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
wound
up
the
last
line
,
untied
the
horse
,
and
they
*NL*
drove
off
.

Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
personal
matter
that
absorbed
Levin
during
his
conversation
with
his
*NL*
brother
was
this
.
Once
in
a
previous
year
he
had
gone
to
look
at
the
*NL*
mowing
,
and
being
made
very
angry
by
the
bailiff
he
had
recourse
to
his
*NL*
favorite
means
for
regaining
his
temper
,
--
he
took
a
scythe
from
a
*NL*
peasant
and
began
mowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
the
work
so
much
that
he
had
several
times
tried
his
hand
at
*NL*
mowing
since
.
He
had
cut
the
whole
of
the
meadow
in
front
of
his
house
,
*NL*
and
this
year
ever
since
the
early
spring
he
had
cherished
a
plan
for
*NL*
mowing
for
whole
days
together
with
the
peasants
.
Ever
since
his
*NL*
brother
's
arrival
,
he
had
been
in
doubt
whether
to
mow
or
not
.
He
was
*NL*
loath
to
leave
his
brother
alone
all
day
long
,
and
he
was
afraid
his
*NL*
brother
would
laugh
at
him
about
it
.
But
as
he
drove
into
the
meadow
,
*NL*
and
recalled
the
sensations
of
mowing
,
he
came
near
deciding
that
he
*NL*
would
go
mowing
.
After
the
irritating
discussion
with
his
brother
,
he
*NL*
pondered
over
this
intention
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
physical
exercise
,
or
my
temper
'll
certainly
be
ruined
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
,
and
he
determined
he
would
go
mowing
,
however
awkward
he
might
*NL*
feel
about
it
with
his
brother
or
the
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
Konstantin
Levin
went
to
his
counting
house
,
gave
*NL*
directions
as
to
the
work
to
be
done
,
and
sent
about
the
village
to
*NL*
summon
the
mowers
for
the
morrow
,
to
cut
the
hay
in
Kalinov
meadow
,
the
*NL*
largest
and
best
of
his
grass
lands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
send
my
scythe
,
please
,
to
Tit
,
for
him
to
set
it
,
and
bring
it
*NL*
round
tomorrow
.
I
shall
maybe
do
some
mowing
myself
too
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
trying
not
to
be
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
smiled
and
said
:
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
tea
the
same
evening
Levin
said
to
his
brother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
the
fine
weather
will
last
.
Tomorrow
I
shall
start
mowing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
fond
of
that
form
of
field
labor
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awfully
fond
of
it
.
I
sometimes
mow
myself
with
the
peasants
,
and
*NL*
tomorrow
I
want
to
try
mowing
the
whole
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
lifted
his
head
,
and
looked
with
interest
at
his
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
Just
like
one
of
the
peasants
,
all
day
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
very
pleasant
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
splendid
as
exercise
,
only
you
'll
hardly
be
able
to
stand
it
,
''
*NL*
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
without
a
shade
of
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
tried
it
.
It
's
hard
work
at
first
,
but
you
get
into
it
.
I
dare
say
*NL*
I
shall
manage
to
keep
it
up
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
what
an
idea
!
But
tell
me
,
how
do
the
peasants
look
at
it
?
I
*NL*
suppose
they
laugh
in
their
sleeves
at
their
master
's
being
such
a
queer
*NL*
fish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
;
but
it
's
so
delightful
,
and
at
the
same
time
such
*NL*
hard
work
,
that
one
has
no
time
to
think
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
will
you
do
about
dining
with
them
?
To
send
you
a
bottle
of
*NL*
Lafitte
and
roast
turkey
out
there
would
be
a
little
awkward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
simply
come
home
at
the
time
of
their
noonday
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
Konstantin
Levin
got
up
earlier
than
usual
,
but
he
was
*NL*
detained
giving
directions
on
the
farm
,
and
when
he
reached
the
mowing
*NL*
grass
the
mowers
were
already
at
their
second
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
uplands
he
could
get
a
view
of
the
shaded
cut
part
of
the
*NL*
meadow
below
,
with
its
grayish
ridges
of
cut
grass
,
and
the
black
heaps
*NL*
of
coats
,
taken
off
by
the
mowers
at
the
place
from
which
they
had
*NL*
started
cutting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
,
as
he
rode
towards
the
meadow
,
the
peasants
came
into
sight
,
*NL*
some
in
coats
,
some
in
their
shirts
mowing
,
one
behind
another
in
a
long
*NL*
string
,
swinging
their
scythes
differently
.
He
counted
forty-two
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
mowing
slowly
over
the
uneven
,
low-lying
parts
of
the
meadow
,
*NL*
where
there
had
been
an
old
dam
.
Levin
recognized
some
of
his
own
men
.
*NL*
Here
was
old
Yermil
in
a
very
long
white
smock
,
bending
forward
to
swing
*NL*
a
scythe
;
there
was
a
young
fellow
,
Vaska
,
who
had
been
a
coachman
of
*NL*
Levin
's
,
taking
every
row
with
a
wide
sweep
.
Here
,
too
,
was
Tit
,
Levin
's
*NL*
preceptor
in
the
art
of
mowing
,
a
thin
little
peasant
.
He
was
in
front
*NL*
of
all
,
and
cut
his
wide
row
without
bending
,
as
though
playing
with
the
*NL*
scythe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
got
off
his
mare
,
and
fastening
her
up
by
the
roadside
went
to
*NL*
meet
Tit
,
who
took
a
second
scythe
out
of
a
bush
and
gave
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ready
,
sir
;
it
's
like
a
razor
,
cuts
of
itself
,
''
said
Tit
,
taking
*NL*
off
his
cap
with
a
smile
and
giving
him
the
scythe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
took
the
scythe
,
and
began
trying
it
.
As
they
finished
their
rows
,
*NL*
the
mowers
,
hot
and
good-humored
,
came
out
into
the
road
one
after
*NL*
another
,
and
,
laughing
a
little
,
greeted
the
master
.
They
all
stared
at
*NL*
him
,
but
no
one
made
any
remark
,
till
a
tall
old
man
,
with
a
wrinkled
,
*NL*
beardless
face
,
wearing
a
short
sheepskin
jacket
,
came
out
into
the
road
*NL*
and
accosted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
`
ee
now
,
master
,
once
take
hold
of
the
rope
there
's
no
letting
it
*NL*
go
!
''
he
said
,
and
Levin
heard
smothered
laughter
among
the
mowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
not
to
let
it
go
,
''
he
said
,
taking
his
stand
behind
Tit
,
and
*NL*
waiting
for
the
time
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
`
ee
,
''
repeated
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tit
made
room
,
and
Levin
started
behind
him
.
The
grass
was
short
close
*NL*
to
the
road
,
and
Levin
,
who
had
not
done
any
mowing
for
a
long
while
,
*NL*
and
was
disconcerted
by
the
eyes
fastened
upon
him
,
cut
badly
for
the
*NL*
first
moments
,
though
he
swung
his
scythe
vigorously
.
Behind
him
he
*NL*
heard
voices
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
set
right
;
handle
's
too
high
;
see
how
he
has
to
stoop
to
it
,
''
*NL*
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Press
more
on
the
heel
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
he
'll
get
on
all
right
,
''
the
old
man
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
made
a
start
...
You
swing
it
too
wide
,
you
'll
tire
yourself
*NL*
out
...
The
master
,
sure
,
does
his
best
for
himself
!
But
see
the
grass
*NL*
missed
out
!
For
such
work
us
fellows
would
catch
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grass
became
softer
,
and
Levin
,
listening
without
answering
,
*NL*
followed
Tit
,
trying
to
do
the
best
he
could
.
They
moved
a
hundred
*NL*
paces
.
Tit
kept
moving
on
,
without
stopping
,
not
showing
the
slightest
*NL*
weariness
,
but
Levin
was
already
beginning
to
be
afraid
he
would
not
be
*NL*
able
to
keep
it
up
:
he
was
so
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
as
he
swung
his
scythe
that
he
was
at
the
very
end
of
his
*NL*
strength
,
and
was
making
up
his
mind
to
ask
Tit
to
stop
.
But
at
that
*NL*
very
moment
Tit
stopped
of
his
own
accord
,
and
stooping
down
picked
up
*NL*
some
grass
,
rubbed
his
scythe
,
and
began
whetting
it
.
Levin
straightened
*NL*
himself
,
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
looked
round
.
Behind
him
came
a
*NL*
peasant
,
and
he
too
was
evidently
tired
,
for
he
stopped
at
once
without
*NL*
waiting
to
mow
up
to
Levin
,
and
began
whetting
his
scythe
.
Tit
sharpened
*NL*
his
scythe
and
Levin
's
,
and
they
went
on
.
The
next
time
it
was
just
the
*NL*
same
.
Tit
moved
on
with
sweep
after
sweep
of
his
scythe
,
not
stopping
*NL*
nor
showing
signs
of
weariness
.
Levin
followed
him
,
trying
not
to
get
*NL*
left
behind
,
and
he
found
it
harder
and
harder
:
the
moment
came
when
he
*NL*
felt
he
had
no
strength
left
,
but
at
that
very
moment
Tit
stopped
and
*NL*
whetted
the
scythes
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
mowed
the
first
row
.
And
this
long
row
seemed
particularly
hard
*NL*
work
to
Levin
;
but
when
the
end
was
reached
and
Tit
,
shouldering
his
*NL*
scythe
,
began
with
deliberate
stride
returning
on
the
tracks
left
by
his
*NL*
heels
in
the
cut
grass
,
and
Levin
walked
back
in
the
same
way
over
the
*NL*
space
he
had
cut
,
in
spite
of
the
sweat
that
ran
in
streams
over
his
*NL*
face
and
fell
in
drops
down
his
nose
,
and
drenched
his
back
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
soaked
in
water
,
he
felt
very
happy
.
What
delighted
him
*NL*
particularly
was
that
now
he
knew
he
would
be
able
to
hold
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
pleasure
was
only
disturbed
by
his
row
not
being
well
cut
.
``
I
will
*NL*
swing
less
with
my
arm
and
more
with
my
whole
body
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
comparing
Tit
's
row
,
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cut
with
a
line
,
*NL*
with
his
own
unevenly
and
irregularly
lying
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
row
,
as
Levin
noticed
,
Tit
had
mowed
specially
quickly
,
*NL*
probably
wishing
to
put
his
master
to
the
test
,
and
the
row
happened
to
*NL*
be
a
long
one
.
The
next
rows
were
easier
,
but
still
Levin
had
to
strain
*NL*
every
nerve
not
to
drop
behind
the
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
nothing
,
wished
for
nothing
,
but
not
to
be
left
behind
the
*NL*
peasants
,
and
to
do
his
work
as
well
as
possible
.
He
heard
nothing
but
*NL*
the
swish
of
scythes
,
and
saw
before
him
Tit
's
upright
figure
mowing
*NL*
away
,
the
crescent-shaped
curve
of
the
cut
grass
,
the
grass
and
flower
*NL*
heads
slowly
and
rhythmically
falling
before
the
blade
of
his
scythe
,
*NL*
and
ahead
of
him
the
end
of
the
row
,
where
would
come
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
in
the
midst
of
his
toil
,
without
understanding
what
it
was
or
*NL*
whence
it
came
,
he
felt
a
pleasant
sensation
of
chill
on
his
hot
,
moist
*NL*
shoulders
.
He
glanced
at
the
sky
in
the
interval
for
whetting
the
*NL*
scythes
.
A
heavy
,
lowering
storm
cloud
had
blown
up
,
and
big
raindrops
*NL*
were
falling
.
Some
of
the
peasants
went
to
their
coats
and
put
them
on
;
*NL*
others
--
just
like
Levin
himself
--
merely
shrugged
their
shoulders
,
*NL*
enjoying
the
pleasant
coolness
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
row
,
and
yet
another
row
,
followed
--
long
rows
and
short
rows
,
*NL*
with
good
grass
and
with
poor
grass
.
Levin
lost
all
sense
of
time
,
and
*NL*
could
not
have
told
whether
it
was
late
or
early
now
.
A
change
began
to
*NL*
come
over
his
work
,
which
gave
him
immense
satisfaction
.
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
his
toil
there
were
moments
during
which
he
forgot
what
he
was
doing
,
*NL*
and
it
came
all
easy
to
him
,
and
at
those
same
moments
his
row
was
*NL*
almost
as
smooth
and
well
cut
as
Tit
's
.
But
so
soon
as
he
recollected
*NL*
what
he
was
doing
,
and
began
trying
to
do
better
,
he
was
at
once
*NL*
conscious
of
all
the
difficulty
of
his
task
,
and
the
row
was
badly
mown
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
finishing
yet
another
row
he
would
have
gone
back
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
meadow
again
to
begin
the
next
,
but
Tit
stopped
,
and
going
up
to
the
old
*NL*
man
said
something
in
a
low
voice
to
him
.
They
both
looked
at
the
sun
.
*NL*
``
What
are
they
talking
about
,
and
why
does
n't
he
go
back
?
''
thought
*NL*
Levin
,
not
guessing
that
the
peasants
had
been
mowing
no
less
than
four
*NL*
hours
without
stopping
,
and
it
was
time
for
their
lunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lunch
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
time
?
That
's
right
;
lunch
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
gave
his
scythe
to
Tit
,
and
together
with
the
peasants
,
who
were
*NL*
crossing
the
long
stretch
of
mown
grass
,
slightly
sprinkled
with
rain
,
*NL*
to
get
their
bread
from
the
heap
of
coats
,
he
went
towards
his
house
.
*NL*
Only
then
he
suddenly
awoke
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
wrong
about
the
*NL*
weather
and
the
rain
was
drenching
his
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hay
will
be
spoiled
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
sir
;
mow
in
the
rain
,
and
you
'll
rake
in
fine
*NL*
weather
!
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
untied
his
horse
and
rode
home
to
his
coffee
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
was
only
just
getting
up
.
When
he
had
drunk
his
coffee
,
Levin
rode
back
*NL*
again
to
the
mowing
before
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
had
time
to
dress
and
*NL*
come
down
to
the
dining
room
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
lunch
Levin
was
not
in
the
same
place
in
the
string
of
mowers
as
*NL*
before
,
but
stood
between
the
old
man
who
had
accosted
him
jocosely
,
and
*NL*
now
invited
him
to
be
his
neighbor
,
and
a
young
peasant
,
who
had
only
*NL*
been
married
in
the
autumn
,
and
who
was
mowing
this
summer
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
holding
himself
erect
,
moved
in
front
,
with
his
feet
turned
*NL*
out
,
taking
long
,
regular
strides
,
and
with
a
precise
and
regular
action
*NL*
which
seemed
to
cost
him
no
more
effort
than
swinging
one
's
arms
in
*NL*
walking
,
as
though
it
were
in
play
,
he
laid
down
the
high
,
even
row
of
*NL*
grass
.
It
was
as
though
it
were
not
he
but
the
sharp
scythe
of
itself
*NL*
swishing
through
the
juicy
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
Levin
came
the
lad
Mishka
.
His
pretty
,
boyish
face
,
with
a
twist
*NL*
of
fresh
grass
bound
round
his
hair
,
was
all
working
with
effort
;
but
*NL*
whenever
anyone
looked
at
him
he
smiled
.
He
would
clearly
have
died
*NL*
sooner
than
own
it
was
hard
work
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
kept
between
them
.
In
the
very
heat
of
the
day
the
mowing
did
not
*NL*
seem
such
hard
work
to
him
.
The
perspiration
with
which
he
was
drenched
*NL*
cooled
him
,
while
the
sun
,
that
burned
his
back
,
his
head
,
and
his
arms
,
*NL*
bare
to
the
elbow
,
gave
a
vigor
and
dogged
energy
to
his
labor
;
and
more
*NL*
and
more
often
now
came
those
moments
of
unconsciousness
,
when
it
was
*NL*
possible
not
to
think
what
one
was
doing
.
The
scythe
cut
of
itself
.
*NL*
These
were
happy
moments
.
Still
more
delightful
were
the
moments
when
*NL*
they
reached
the
stream
where
the
rows
ended
,
and
the
old
man
rubbed
his
*NL*
scythe
with
the
wet
,
thick
grass
,
rinsed
its
blade
in
the
fresh
water
of
*NL*
the
stream
,
ladled
out
a
little
in
a
tin
dipper
,
and
offered
Levin
a
*NL*
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
to
my
home-brew
,
eh
?
Good
,
eh
?
''
said
he
,
winking
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
truly
Levin
had
never
drunk
any
liquor
so
good
as
this
warm
water
*NL*
with
green
bits
floating
in
it
,
and
a
taste
of
rust
from
the
tin
dipper
.
*NL*
And
immediately
after
this
came
the
delicious
,
slow
saunter
,
with
his
*NL*
hand
on
the
scythe
,
during
which
he
could
wipe
away
the
streaming
sweat
,
*NL*
take
deep
breaths
of
air
,
and
look
about
at
the
long
string
of
mowers
*NL*
and
at
what
was
happening
around
in
the
forest
and
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
longer
Levin
mowed
,
the
oftener
he
felt
the
moments
of
*NL*
unconsciousness
in
which
it
seemed
not
his
hands
that
swung
the
scythe
,
*NL*
but
the
scythe
mowing
of
itself
,
a
body
full
of
life
and
consciousness
*NL*
of
its
own
,
and
as
though
by
magic
,
without
thinking
of
it
,
the
work
*NL*
turned
out
regular
and
well-finished
of
itself
.
These
were
the
most
*NL*
blissful
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
hard
work
when
he
had
to
break
off
the
motion
,
which
had
*NL*
become
unconscious
,
and
to
think
;
when
he
had
to
mow
round
a
hillock
or
*NL*
a
tuft
of
sorrel
.
The
old
man
did
this
easily
.
When
a
hillock
came
he
*NL*
changed
his
action
,
and
at
one
time
with
the
heel
,
and
at
another
with
*NL*
the
tip
of
his
scythe
,
clipped
the
hillock
round
both
sides
with
short
*NL*
strokes
.
And
while
he
did
this
he
kept
looking
about
and
watching
what
*NL*
came
into
his
view
:
at
one
moment
he
picked
a
wild
berry
and
ate
it
or
*NL*
offered
it
to
Levin
,
then
he
flung
away
a
twig
with
the
blade
of
the
*NL*
scythe
,
then
he
looked
at
a
quail
's
nest
,
from
which
the
bird
flew
just
*NL*
under
the
scythe
,
or
caught
a
snake
that
crossed
his
path
,
and
lifting
*NL*
it
on
the
scythe
as
though
on
a
fork
showed
it
to
Levin
and
threw
it
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
both
Levin
and
the
young
peasant
behind
him
,
such
changes
of
*NL*
position
were
difficult
.
Both
of
them
,
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
*NL*
same
strained
movement
,
were
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
toil
,
and
were
*NL*
incapable
of
shifting
their
position
and
at
the
same
time
watching
what
*NL*
was
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
notice
how
time
was
passing
.
If
he
had
been
asked
how
long
*NL*
he
had
been
working
he
would
have
said
half
an
hour
--
and
it
was
getting
*NL*
on
for
dinner
time
.
As
they
were
walking
back
over
the
cut
grass
,
the
*NL*
old
man
called
Levin
's
attention
to
the
little
girls
and
boys
who
were
*NL*
coming
from
different
directions
,
hardly
visible
through
the
long
grass
,
*NL*
and
along
the
road
towards
the
mowers
,
carrying
sacks
of
bread
dragging
*NL*
at
their
little
hands
and
pitchers
of
the
sour
rye-beer
,
with
cloths
*NL*
wrapped
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
`
ee
,
the
little
emmets
crawling
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
them
,
and
he
*NL*
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
to
look
at
the
sun
.
They
mowed
two
more
*NL*
rows
;
the
old
man
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
master
,
dinner
time
!
''
he
said
briskly
.
And
on
reaching
the
stream
*NL*
the
mowers
moved
off
across
the
lines
of
cut
grass
towards
their
pile
of
*NL*
coats
,
where
the
children
who
had
brought
their
dinners
were
sitting
*NL*
waiting
for
them
.
The
peasants
gathered
into
groups
--
those
further
away
*NL*
under
a
cart
,
those
nearer
under
a
willow
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
sat
down
by
them
;
he
felt
disinclined
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
constraint
with
the
master
had
disappeared
long
ago
.
The
peasants
*NL*
got
ready
for
dinner
.
Some
washed
,
the
young
lads
bathed
in
the
stream
,
*NL*
others
made
a
place
comfortable
for
a
rest
,
untied
their
sacks
of
bread
,
*NL*
and
uncovered
the
pitchers
of
rye-beer
.
The
old
man
crumbled
up
some
*NL*
bread
in
a
cup
,
stirred
it
with
the
handle
of
a
spoon
,
poured
water
on
*NL*
it
from
the
dipper
,
broke
up
some
more
bread
,
and
having
seasoned
it
*NL*
with
salt
,
he
turned
to
the
east
to
say
his
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
master
,
taste
my
sop
,
''
said
he
,
kneeling
down
before
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sop
was
so
good
that
Levin
gave
up
the
idea
of
going
home
.
He
dined
*NL*
with
the
old
man
,
and
talked
to
him
about
his
family
affairs
,
taking
the
*NL*
keenest
interest
in
them
,
and
told
him
about
his
own
affairs
and
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
that
could
be
of
interest
to
the
old
man
.
He
felt
much
*NL*
nearer
to
him
than
to
his
brother
,
and
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
*NL*
affection
he
felt
for
this
man
.
When
the
old
man
got
up
again
,
said
his
*NL*
prayer
,
and
lay
down
under
a
bush
,
putting
some
grass
under
his
head
for
*NL*
a
pillow
,
Levin
did
the
same
,
and
in
spite
of
the
clinging
flies
that
*NL*
were
so
persistent
in
the
sunshine
,
and
the
midges
that
tickled
his
hot
*NL*
face
and
body
,
he
fell
asleep
at
once
and
only
waked
when
the
sun
had
*NL*
passed
to
the
other
side
of
the
bush
and
reached
him
.
The
old
man
had
*NL*
been
awake
a
long
while
,
and
was
sitting
up
whetting
the
scythes
of
the
*NL*
younger
lads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
about
him
and
hardly
recognized
the
place
,
everything
was
*NL*
so
changed
.
The
immense
stretch
of
meadow
had
been
mown
and
was
*NL*
sparkling
with
a
peculiar
fresh
brilliance
,
with
its
lines
of
already
*NL*
sweet-smelling
grass
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
evening
sun
.
And
the
*NL*
bushes
about
the
river
had
been
cut
down
,
and
the
river
itself
,
not
*NL*
visible
before
,
now
gleaming
like
steel
in
its
bends
,
and
the
moving
,
*NL*
ascending
,
peasants
,
and
the
sharp
wall
of
grass
of
the
unmown
part
of
*NL*
the
meadow
,
and
the
hawks
hovering
over
the
stripped
meadow
--
all
was
*NL*
perfectly
new
.
Raising
himself
,
Levin
began
considering
how
much
had
*NL*
been
cut
and
how
much
more
could
still
be
done
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
work
done
was
exceptionally
much
for
forty-two
men
.
They
had
cut
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
big
meadow
,
which
had
,
in
the
years
of
serf
labor
,
taken
*NL*
thirty
scythes
two
days
to
mow
.
Only
the
corners
remained
to
do
,
where
*NL*
the
rows
were
short
.
But
Levin
felt
a
longing
to
get
as
much
mowing
done
*NL*
that
day
as
possible
,
and
was
vexed
with
the
sun
sinking
so
quickly
in
*NL*
the
sky
.
He
felt
no
weariness
;
all
he
wanted
was
to
get
his
work
done
*NL*
more
and
more
quickly
and
as
much
done
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
cut
Mashkin
Upland
too
?
--
what
do
you
think
?
''
he
said
to
the
*NL*
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
God
wills
,
the
sun
's
not
high
.
A
little
vodka
for
the
lads
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
afternoon
rest
,
when
they
were
sitting
down
again
,
and
those
who
*NL*
smoked
had
lighted
their
pipes
,
the
old
man
told
the
men
that
``
Mashkin
*NL*
Upland
's
to
be
cut
--
there
'll
be
some
vodka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
cut
it
?
Come
on
,
Tit
!
We
'll
look
sharp
!
We
can
eat
at
night
.
*NL*
Come
on
!
''
cried
voices
,
and
eating
up
their
bread
,
the
mowers
went
back
*NL*
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
lads
,
keep
it
up
!
''
said
Tit
,
and
ran
on
ahead
almost
at
a
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
along
,
get
along
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
hurrying
after
him
and
easily
*NL*
overtaking
him
,
``
I
'll
mow
you
down
,
look
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
young
and
old
mowed
away
,
as
though
they
were
racing
with
one
*NL*
another
.
But
however
fast
they
worked
,
they
did
not
spoil
the
grass
,
and
*NL*
the
rows
were
laid
just
as
neatly
and
exactly
.
The
little
piece
left
*NL*
uncut
in
the
corner
was
mown
in
five
minutes
.
The
last
of
the
mowers
*NL*
were
just
ending
their
rows
while
the
foremost
snatched
up
their
coats
*NL*
onto
their
shoulders
,
and
crossed
the
road
towards
Mashkin
Upland
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
already
sinking
into
the
trees
when
they
went
with
their
*NL*
jingling
dippers
into
the
wooded
ravine
of
Mashkin
Upland
.
The
grass
was
*NL*
up
to
their
waists
in
the
middle
of
the
hollow
,
soft
,
tender
,
and
*NL*
feathery
,
spotted
here
and
there
among
the
trees
with
wild
heart
's
-
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
brief
consultation
--
whether
to
take
the
rows
lengthwise
or
*NL*
diagonally
--
Prohor
Yermilin
,
also
a
renowned
mower
,
a
huge
,
black-haired
*NL*
peasant
,
went
on
ahead
.
He
went
up
to
the
top
,
turned
back
again
and
*NL*
started
mowing
,
and
they
all
proceeded
to
form
in
line
behind
him
,
going
*NL*
downhill
through
the
hollow
and
uphill
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
forest
.
The
sun
sank
behind
the
forest
.
The
dew
was
falling
by
now
;
the
*NL*
mowers
were
in
the
sun
only
on
the
hillside
,
but
below
,
where
a
mist
was
*NL*
rising
,
and
on
the
opposite
side
,
they
mowed
into
the
fresh
,
dewy
shade
.
*NL*
The
work
went
rapidly
.
The
grass
cut
with
a
juicy
sound
,
and
was
at
once
*NL*
laid
in
high
,
fragrant
rows
.
The
mowers
from
all
sides
,
brought
closer
*NL*
together
in
the
short
row
,
kept
urging
one
another
on
to
the
sound
of
*NL*
jingling
dippers
and
clanging
scythes
,
and
the
hiss
of
the
whetstones
*NL*
sharpening
them
,
and
good-humored
shouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
still
kept
between
the
young
peasant
and
the
old
man
.
The
old
man
,
*NL*
who
had
put
on
his
short
sheepskin
jacket
,
was
just
as
good-humored
,
*NL*
jocose
,
and
free
in
his
movements
.
Among
the
trees
they
were
continually
*NL*
cutting
with
their
scythes
the
so-called
``
birch
mushrooms
,
''
swollen
fat
*NL*
in
the
succulent
grass
.
But
the
old
man
bent
down
every
time
he
came
*NL*
across
a
mushroom
,
picked
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
bosom
.
``
Another
*NL*
present
for
my
old
woman
,
''
he
said
as
he
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Easy
as
it
was
to
mow
the
wet
,
soft
grass
,
it
was
hard
work
going
up
and
*NL*
down
the
steep
sides
of
the
ravine
.
But
this
did
not
trouble
the
old
*NL*
man
.
Swinging
his
scythe
just
as
ever
,
and
moving
his
feet
in
their
big
,
*NL*
plaited
shoes
with
firm
,
little
steps
,
he
climbed
slowly
up
the
steep
*NL*
place
,
and
though
his
breeches
hanging
out
below
his
smock
,
and
his
*NL*
whole
frame
trembled
with
effort
,
he
did
not
miss
one
blade
of
grass
or
*NL*
one
mushroom
on
his
way
,
and
kept
making
jokes
with
the
peasants
and
*NL*
Levin
.
Levin
walked
after
him
and
often
thought
he
must
fall
,
as
he
*NL*
climbed
with
a
scythe
up
a
steep
cliff
where
it
would
have
been
hard
*NL*
work
to
clamber
without
anything
.
But
he
climbed
up
and
did
what
he
had
*NL*
to
do
.
He
felt
as
though
some
external
force
were
moving
him
.

Chapter
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mashkin
Upland
was
mown
,
the
last
row
finished
,
the
peasants
had
put
on
*NL*
their
coats
and
were
gaily
trudging
home
.
Levin
got
on
his
horse
and
,
*NL*
parting
regretfully
from
the
peasants
,
rode
homewards
.
On
the
hillside
*NL*
he
looked
back
;
he
could
not
see
them
in
the
mist
that
had
risen
from
*NL*
the
valley
;
he
could
only
hear
rough
,
good-humored
voices
,
laughter
,
and
*NL*
the
sound
of
clanking
scythes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
long
ago
finished
dinner
,
and
was
drinking
iced
*NL*
lemon
and
water
in
his
own
room
,
looking
through
the
reviews
and
papers
*NL*
which
he
had
only
just
received
by
post
,
when
Levin
rushed
into
the
*NL*
room
,
talking
merrily
,
with
his
wet
and
matted
hair
sticking
to
his
*NL*
forehead
,
and
his
back
and
chest
grimed
and
moist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
mowed
the
whole
meadow
!
Oh
,
it
is
nice
,
delicious
!
And
how
have
you
*NL*
been
getting
on
?
''
said
Levin
,
completely
forgetting
the
disagreeable
*NL*
conversation
of
the
previous
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
what
do
you
look
like
!
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
for
the
first
*NL*
moment
looking
round
with
some
dissatisfaction
.
``
And
the
door
,
do
shut
*NL*
the
door
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
must
have
let
in
a
dozen
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
could
not
endure
flies
,
and
in
his
own
room
he
never
*NL*
opened
the
window
except
at
night
,
and
carefully
kept
the
door
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
one
,
on
my
honor
.
But
if
I
have
,
I
'll
catch
them
.
You
would
n't
*NL*
believe
what
a
pleasure
it
is
!
How
have
you
spent
the
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
But
have
you
really
been
mowing
the
whole
day
?
I
expect
*NL*
you
're
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
.
Kouzma
has
got
everything
ready
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
feel
hungry
even
.
I
had
something
to
eat
there
.
But
I
'll
go
*NL*
and
wash

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
along
,
go
along
,
and
I
'll
come
to
you
directly

''
said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
shaking
his
head
as
he
looked
at
his
brother
.
``
Go
along
,
*NL*
make
haste
,
''
he
added
smiling
,
and
gathering
up
his
books
,
he
prepared
*NL*
to
go
too
.
He
,
too
,
felt
suddenly
good-humored
and
disinclined
to
leave
*NL*
his
brother
's
side
.
``
But
what
did
you
do
while
it
was
raining
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rain
?
Why
,
there
was
scarcely
a
drop
.
I
'll
come
directly
.
So
you
had
a
*NL*
nice
day
too
?
That
's
first-rate
.
''
And
Levin
went
off
to
change
his
*NL*
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
minutes
later
the
brothers
met
in
the
dining
room
.
Although
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Levin
that
he
was
not
hungry
,
and
he
sat
down
to
dinner
simply
*NL*
so
as
not
to
hurt
Kouzma
's
feelings
,
yet
when
he
began
to
eat
the
dinner
*NL*
struck
him
as
extraordinarily
good
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
watched
him
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
there
's
a
letter
for
you
,
''
said
he
.
``
Kouzma
,
bring
it
*NL*
down
,
please
.
And
mind
you
shut
the
doors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
from
Oblonsky
.
Levin
read
it
aloud
.
Oblonsky
wrote
to
him
*NL*
from
Petersburg
:
``
I
have
had
a
letter
from
Dolly
;
she
's
at
Ergushovo

*NL*
and
everything
seems
going
wrong
there
.
Do
ride
over
and
see
her

*NL*
please
;
help
her
with
advice

you
know
all
about
it

She
will
be
so
glad
*NL*
to
see
you

She
's
quite
alone
,
poor
thing

My
mother-in-law
and
all
of
*NL*
them
are
still
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
capital
!
I
will
certainly
ride
over
to
her
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
Or
*NL*
we
'll
go
together

She
's
such
a
splendid
woman

is
n't
she

*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five

thirty

drive
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted

''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
still
smiling
.
The
sight
*NL*
of
his
younger
brother
's
appearance
had
immediately
put
him
in
a
good
*NL*
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
an
appetite
!
''
he
said
,
looking
at
his
dark-red
,
sunburnt
*NL*
face
and
neck
bent
over
the
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
You
ca
n't
imagine
what
an
effectual
remedy
it
is
for
every
*NL*
sort
of
foolishness
.
I
want
to
enrich
medicine
with
a
new
word
:
*NL*
_
Arbeitskur
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
you
do
n't
need
it
,
I
should
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
for
all
sorts
of
nervous
invalids
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
ought
to
be
tried
.
I
had
meant
to
come
to
the
mowing
to
look
at
*NL*
you
,
but
it
was
so
unbearably
hot
that
I
got
no
further
than
the
forest
.
*NL*
I
sat
there
a
little
,
and
went
on
by
the
forest
to
the
village
,
met
your
*NL*
old
nurse
,
and
sounded
her
as
to
the
peasants
'
view
of
you
.
As
far
as
I
*NL*
can
make
out
,
they
do
n't
approve
of
this
.
She
said
:
`
It
's
not
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
work
.
'
Altogether
,
I
fancy
that
in
the
people
's
ideas
there
*NL*
are
very
clear
and
definite
notions
of
certain
,
as
they
call
it
,
*NL*
`
gentlemanly
'
lines
of
action
.
And
they
do
n't
sanction
the
gentry
's
*NL*
moving
outside
bounds
clearly
laid
down
in
their
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
so
;
but
anyway
it
's
a
pleasure
such
as
I
have
never
known
in
my
*NL*
life
.
And
there
's
no
harm
in
it
,
you
know
.
Is
there
?
''
answered
Levin
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
if
they
do
n't
like
it
.
Though
I
do
believe
it
's
all
right
.
*NL*
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altogether
,
''
pursued
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
``
you
're
satisfied
with
your
*NL*
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
satisfied
.
We
cut
the
whole
meadow
.
And
such
a
splendid
old
man
I
*NL*
made
friends
with
there
!
You
ca
n't
fancy
how
delightful
he
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
you
're
content
with
your
day
.
And
so
am
I.
First
,
I
solved
two
*NL*
chess
problems
,
and
one
a
very
pretty
one
--
a
pawn
opening
.
I
'll
show
it
*NL*
you
.
And
then
--
I
thought
over
our
conversation
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
our
conversation
yesterday
?
''
said
Levin
,
blissfully
dropping
his
*NL*
eyelids
and
drawing
deep
breaths
after
finishing
his
dinner
,
and
*NL*
absolutely
incapable
of
recalling
what
their
conversation
yesterday
was
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
partly
right
.
Our
difference
of
opinion
amounts
to
*NL*
this
,
that
you
make
the
mainspring
self-interest
,
while
I
suppose
that
*NL*
interest
in
the
common
weal
is
bound
to
exist
in
every
man
of
a
certain
*NL*
degree
of
advancement
.
Possibly
you
are
right
too
,
that
action
founded
*NL*
on
material
interest
would
be
more
desirable
.
You
are
altogether
,
as
the
*NL*
French
say
,
too
_
primesautiere
_
a
nature
;
you
must
have
intense
,
*NL*
energetic
action
,
or
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
listened
to
his
brother
and
did
not
understand
a
single
word
,
and
*NL*
did
not
want
to
understand
.
He
was
only
afraid
his
brother
might
ask
him
*NL*
some
question
which
would
make
it
evident
he
had
not
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
what
I
think
it
is
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
*NL*
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
.
But
,
do
you
know
?
I
wo
n't
stand
up
for
my
view
,
''
*NL*
answered
Levin
,
with
a
guilty
,
childlike
smile
.
``
Whatever
was
it
I
was
*NL*
disputing
about
?
''
he
wondered
.
``
Of
course
,
I
'm
right
,
and
he
's
right
,
*NL*
and
it
's
all
first-rate
.
Only
I
must
go
round
to
the
counting
house
and
*NL*
see
to
things
.
''
He
got
up
,
stretching
and
smiling
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
smiled
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
go
out
,
let
's
go
together
,
''
he
said
,
disinclined
to
be
*NL*
parted
from
his
brother
,
who
seemed
positively
breathing
out
freshness
*NL*
and
energy
.
``
Come
,
we
'll
go
to
the
counting
house
,
if
you
have
to
go
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
heavens
!
''
shouted
Levin
,
so
loudly
that
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
quite
*NL*
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
hand
?
''
said
Levin
,
slapping
himself
on
the
*NL*
head
.
``
I
'd
positively
forgotten
her
even
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyway
I
'll
run
down
to
her
.
Before
you
've
time
to
get
your
hat
*NL*
on
,
I
'll
be
back

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
ran
downstairs
,
clattering
with
his
heels
like
a
spring-rattle

Chapter
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stephan
Arkadyevitch
had
gone
to
Petersburg
to
perform
the
most
natural
*NL*
and
essential
official
duty
--
so
familiar
to
everyone
in
the
government
*NL*
service
,
though
incomprehensible
to
outsiders
--
that
duty
,
but
for
which
*NL*
one
could
hardly
be
in
government
service
,
of
reminding
the
ministry
of
*NL*
his
existence
--
and
having
,
for
the
due
performance
of
this
rite
,
taken
*NL*
all
the
available
cash
from
home
,
was
gaily
and
agreeably
spending
his
*NL*
days
at
the
races
and
in
the
summer
villas
.
Meanwhile
Dolly
and
the
*NL*
children
had
moved
into
the
country
,
to
cut
down
expenses
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
.
She
had
gone
to
Ergushovo
,
the
estate
that
had
been
her
dowry
,
*NL*
and
the
one
where
in
spring
the
forest
had
been
sold
.
It
was
nearly
*NL*
forty
miles
from
Levin
's
Pokrovskoe
.
The
big
,
old
house
at
Ergushovo
had
*NL*
been
pulled
down
long
ago
,
and
the
old
prince
had
had
the
lodge
done
up
*NL*
and
built
on
to
.
Twenty
years
before
,
when
Dolly
was
a
child
,
the
lodge
*NL*
had
been
roomy
and
comfortable
,
though
,
like
all
lodges
,
it
stood
*NL*
sideways
to
the
entrance
avenue
,
and
faced
the
south
.
But
by
now
this
*NL*
lodge
was
old
and
dilapidated
.
When
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
gone
down
in
*NL*
the
spring
to
sell
the
forest
,
Dolly
had
begged
him
to
look
over
the
*NL*
house
and
order
what
repairs
might
be
needed
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
like
*NL*
all
unfaithful
husbands
indeed
,
was
very
solicitous
for
his
wife
's
*NL*
comfort
,
and
he
had
himself
looked
over
the
house
,
and
given
*NL*
instructions
about
everything
that
he
considered
necessary
.
What
he
*NL*
considered
necessary
was
to
cover
all
the
furniture
with
cretonne
,
to
*NL*
put
up
curtains
,
to
weed
the
garden
,
to
make
a
little
bridge
on
the
*NL*
pond
,
and
to
plant
flowers
.
But
he
forgot
many
other
essential
matters
,
*NL*
the
want
of
which
greatly
distressed
Darya
Alexandrovna
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
efforts
to
be
an
attentive
father
and
*NL*
husband
,
he
never
could
keep
in
his
mind
that
he
had
a
wife
and
*NL*
children
.
He
had
bachelor
tastes
,
and
it
was
in
accordance
with
them
*NL*
that
he
shaped
his
life
.
On
his
return
to
Moscow
he
informed
his
wife
*NL*
with
pride
that
everything
was
ready
,
that
the
house
would
be
a
little
*NL*
paradise
,
and
that
he
advised
her
most
certainly
to
go
.
His
wife
's
*NL*
staying
away
in
the
country
was
very
agreeable
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
from
every
point
of
view
:
it
did
the
children
good
,
it
decreased
*NL*
expenses
,
and
it
left
him
more
at
liberty
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
regarded
*NL*
staying
in
the
country
for
the
summer
as
essential
for
the
children
,
*NL*
especially
for
the
little
girl
,
who
had
not
succeeded
in
regaining
her
*NL*
strength
after
the
scarlatina
,
and
also
as
a
means
of
escaping
the
petty
*NL*
humiliations
,
the
little
bills
owing
to
the
wood-merchant
,
the
*NL*
fishmonger
,
the
shoemaker
,
which
made
her
miserable
.
Besides
this
,
she
*NL*
was
pleased
to
go
away
to
the
country
because
she
was
dreaming
of
*NL*
getting
her
sister
Kitty
to
stay
with
her
there
.
Kitty
was
to
be
back
*NL*
from
abroad
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
,
and
bathing
had
been
prescribed
*NL*
for
her
.
Kitty
wrote
that
no
prospect
was
so
alluring
as
to
spend
the
*NL*
summer
with
Dolly
at
Ergushovo
,
full
of
childish
associations
for
both
*NL*
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
days
of
her
existence
in
the
country
were
very
hard
for
Dolly
.
*NL*
She
used
to
stay
in
the
country
as
a
child
,
and
the
impression
she
had
*NL*
retained
of
it
was
that
the
country
was
a
refuge
from
all
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
of
the
town
,
that
life
there
,
though
not
luxurious
--
Dolly
*NL*
could
easily
make
up
her
mind
to
that
--
was
cheap
and
comfortable
;
that
*NL*
there
was
plenty
of
everything
,
everything
was
cheap
,
everything
could
*NL*
be
got
,
and
children
were
happy
.
But
now
coming
to
the
country
as
the
*NL*
head
of
a
family
,
she
perceived
that
it
was
all
utterly
unlike
what
she
*NL*
had
fancied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
their
arrival
there
was
a
heavy
fall
of
rain
,
and
in
the
*NL*
night
the
water
came
through
in
the
corridor
and
in
the
nursery
,
so
that
*NL*
the
beds
had
to
be
carried
into
the
drawing
room
.
There
was
no
kitchen
*NL*
maid
to
be
found
;
of
the
nine
cows
,
it
appeared
from
the
words
of
the
*NL*
cowherd-woman
that
some
were
about
to
calve
,
others
had
just
calved
,
*NL*
others
were
old
,
and
others
again
hard-uddered
;
there
was
not
butter
nor
*NL*
milk
enough
even
for
the
children
.
There
were
no
eggs
.
They
could
get
no
*NL*
fowls
;
old
,
purplish
,
stringy
cocks
were
all
they
had
for
roasting
and
*NL*
boiling
.
Impossible
to
get
women
to
scrub
the
floors
--
all
were
*NL*
potato-hoeing
.
Driving
was
out
of
the
question
,
because
one
of
the
*NL*
horses
was
restive
,
and
bolted
in
the
shafts
.
There
was
no
place
where
*NL*
they
could
bathe
;
the
whole
of
the
river-bank
was
trampled
by
the
cattle
*NL*
and
open
to
the
road
;
even
walks
were
impossible
,
for
the
cattle
strayed
*NL*
into
the
garden
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
,
and
there
was
one
terrible
*NL*
bull
,
who
bellowed
,
and
therefore
might
be
expected
to
gore
somebody
.
*NL*
There
were
no
proper
cupboards
for
their
clothes
;
what
cupboards
there
*NL*
were
either
would
not
close
at
all
,
or
burst
open
whenever
anyone
passed
*NL*
by
them
.
There
were
no
pots
and
pans
;
there
was
no
copper
in
the
*NL*
washhouse
,
nor
even
an
ironing-board
in
the
maids
'
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
instead
of
peace
and
rest
all
these
,
from
her
point
of
view
,
*NL*
fearful
calamities
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
at
first
in
despair
.
She
*NL*
exerted
herself
to
the
utmost
,
felt
the
hopelessness
of
the
position
,
*NL*
and
was
every
instant
suppressing
the
tears
that
started
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
The
bailiff
,
a
retired
quartermaster
,
whom
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
taken
*NL*
a
fancy
to
and
had
appointed
bailiff
on
account
of
his
handsome
and
*NL*
respectful
appearance
as
a
hall-porter
,
showed
no
sympathy
for
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
's
woes
.
He
said
respectfully
,
``
nothing
can
be
done
,
the
*NL*
peasants
are
such
a
wretched
lot
,
''
and
did
nothing
to
help
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
seemed
hopeless
.
But
in
the
Oblonskys
'
household
,
as
in
all
*NL*
families
indeed
,
there
was
one
inconspicuous
but
most
valuable
and
*NL*
useful
person
,
Marya
Philimonovna
.
She
soothed
her
mistress
,
assured
her
*NL*
that
everything
would
_
come
round
_
-LRB-
it
was
her
expression
,
and
Matvey
*NL*
had
borrowed
it
from
her
-RRB-
,
and
without
fuss
or
hurry
proceeded
to
set
to
*NL*
work
herself
.
She
had
immediately
made
friends
with
the
bailiff
's
wife
,
*NL*
and
on
the
very
first
day
she
drank
tea
with
her
and
the
bailiff
under
*NL*
the
acacias
,
and
reviewed
all
the
circumstances
of
the
position
.
Very
*NL*
soon
Marya
Philimonovna
had
established
her
club
,
so
to
say
,
under
the
*NL*
acacias
,
and
there
it
was
,
in
this
club
,
consisting
of
the
bailiff
's
*NL*
wife
,
the
village
elder
,
and
the
counting
house
clerk
,
that
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
existence
were
gradually
smoothed
away
,
and
in
a
week
's
*NL*
time
everything
actually
had
come
round
.
The
roof
was
mended
,
a
kitchen
*NL*
maid
was
found
--
a
crony
of
the
village
elder
's
--
hens
were
bought
,
the
*NL*
cows
began
giving
milk
,
the
garden
hedge
was
stopped
up
with
stakes
,
the
*NL*
carpenter
made
a
mangle
,
hooks
were
put
in
the
cupboards
,
and
they
*NL*
ceased
to
burst
open
spontaneously
,
and
an
ironing-board
covered
with
*NL*
army
cloth
was
placed
across
from
the
arm
of
a
chair
to
the
chest
of
*NL*
drawers
,
and
there
was
a
smell
of
flatirons
in
the
maids
'
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
,
now
,
and
you
were
quite
in
despair
,
''
said
Marya
Philimonovna
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
ironing-board
.
They
even
rigged
up
a
bathing-shed
of
*NL*
straw
hurdles
.
Lily
began
to
bathe
,
and
Darya
Alexandrovna
began
to
*NL*
realize
,
if
only
in
part
,
her
expectations
,
if
not
of
a
peaceful
,
at
*NL*
least
of
a
comfortable
,
life
in
the
country
.
Peaceful
with
six
children
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
could
not
be
.
One
would
fall
ill
,
another
might
*NL*
easily
become
so
,
a
third
would
be
without
something
necessary
,
a
fourth
*NL*
would
show
symptoms
of
a
bad
disposition
,
and
so
on
.
Rare
indeed
were
*NL*
the
brief
periods
of
peace
.
But
these
cares
and
anxieties
were
for
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
the
sole
happiness
possible
.
Had
it
not
been
for
them
,
she
*NL*
would
have
been
left
alone
to
brood
over
her
husband
who
did
not
love
*NL*
her
.
And
besides
,
hard
though
it
was
for
the
mother
to
bear
the
dread
of
*NL*
illness
,
the
illnesses
themselves
,
and
the
grief
of
seeing
signs
of
evil
*NL*
propensities
in
her
children
--
the
children
themselves
were
even
now
*NL*
repaying
her
in
small
joys
for
her
sufferings
.
Those
joys
were
so
small
*NL*
that
they
passed
unnoticed
,
like
gold
in
sand
,
and
at
bad
moments
she
*NL*
could
see
nothing
but
the
pain
,
nothing
but
sand
;
but
there
were
good
*NL*
moments
too
when
she
saw
nothing
but
the
joy
,
nothing
but
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
in
the
solitude
of
the
country
,
she
began
to
be
more
and
more
*NL*
frequently
aware
of
those
joys
.
Often
,
looking
at
them
,
she
would
make
*NL*
every
possible
effort
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
mistaken
,
that
*NL*
she
as
a
mother
was
partial
to
her
children
.
All
the
same
,
she
could
not
*NL*
help
saying
to
herself
that
she
had
charming
children
,
all
six
of
them
*NL*
in
different
ways
,
but
a
set
of
children
such
as
is
not
often
to
be
met
*NL*
with
,
and
she
was
happy
in
them
,
and
proud
of
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
May
,
when
everything
had
been
more
or
less
*NL*
satisfactorily
arranged
,
she
received
her
husband
's
answer
to
her
*NL*
complaints
of
the
disorganized
state
of
things
in
the
country
.
He
wrote
*NL*
begging
her
forgiveness
for
not
having
thought
of
everything
before
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
come
down
at
the
first
chance
.
This
chance
did
not
present
*NL*
itself
,
and
till
the
beginning
of
June
Darya
Alexandrovna
stayed
alone
*NL*
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Sunday
in
St.
Peter
's
week
Darya
Alexandrovna
drove
to
mass
for
*NL*
all
her
children
to
take
the
sacrament
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
in
her
*NL*
intimate
,
philosophical
talks
with
her
sister
,
her
mother
,
and
her
*NL*
friends
very
often
astonished
them
by
the
freedom
of
her
views
in
regard
*NL*
to
religion
.
She
had
a
strange
religion
of
transmigration
of
souls
all
*NL*
her
own
,
in
which
she
had
firm
faith
,
troubling
herself
little
about
the
*NL*
dogmas
of
the
Church
.
But
in
her
family
she
was
strict
in
carrying
out
*NL*
all
that
was
required
by
the
Church
--
and
not
merely
in
order
to
set
an
*NL*
example
,
but
with
all
her
heart
in
it
.
The
fact
that
the
children
had
*NL*
not
been
at
the
sacrament
for
nearly
a
year
worried
her
extremely
,
and
*NL*
with
the
full
approval
and
sympathy
of
Marya
Philimonovna
she
decided
*NL*
that
this
should
take
place
now
in
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
days
before
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
busily
deliberating
on
*NL*
how
to
dress
all
the
children
.
Frocks
were
made
or
altered
and
washed
,
*NL*
seams
and
flounces
were
let
out
,
buttons
were
sewn
on
,
and
ribbons
got
*NL*
ready
.
One
dress
,
Tanya
's
,
which
the
English
governess
had
undertaken
,
*NL*
cost
Darya
Alexandrovna
much
loss
of
temper
.
The
English
governess
in
*NL*
altering
it
had
made
the
seams
in
the
wrong
place
,
had
taken
up
the
*NL*
sleeves
too
much
,
and
altogether
spoilt
the
dress
.
It
was
so
narrow
on
*NL*
Tanya
's
shoulders
that
it
was
quite
painful
to
look
at
her
.
But
Marya
*NL*
Philimonovna
had
the
happy
thought
of
putting
in
gussets
,
and
adding
a
*NL*
little
shoulder-cape
.
The
dress
was
set
right
,
but
there
was
nearly
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
the
English
governess
.
On
the
morning
,
however
,
all
was
*NL*
happily
arranged
,
and
towards
ten
o'clock
--
the
time
at
which
they
had
*NL*
asked
the
priest
to
wait
for
them
for
the
mass
--
the
children
in
their
*NL*
new
dresses
,
with
beaming
faces
,
stood
on
the
step
before
the
carriage
*NL*
waiting
for
their
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
carriage
,
instead
of
the
restive
Raven
,
they
had
harnessed
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
representations
of
Marya
Philimonovna
,
the
bailiff
's
*NL*
horse
,
Brownie
,
and
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
delayed
by
anxiety
over
her
own
*NL*
attire
,
came
out
and
got
in
,
dressed
in
a
white
muslin
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
done
her
hair
,
and
dressed
with
care
and
*NL*
excitement
.
In
the
old
days
she
had
dressed
for
her
own
sake
to
look
*NL*
pretty
and
be
admired
.
Later
on
,
as
she
got
older
,
dress
became
more
and
*NL*
more
distasteful
to
her
.
She
saw
that
she
was
losing
her
good
looks
.
But
*NL*
now
she
began
to
feel
pleasure
and
interest
in
dress
again
.
Now
she
did
*NL*
not
dress
for
her
own
sake
,
not
for
the
sake
of
her
own
beauty
,
but
*NL*
simply
that
as
the
mother
of
those
exquisite
creatures
she
might
not
*NL*
spoil
the
general
effect
.
And
looking
at
herself
for
the
last
time
in
*NL*
the
looking-glass
she
was
satisfied
with
herself
.
She
looked
nice
.
Not
*NL*
nice
as
she
would
have
wished
to
look
nice
in
old
days
at
a
ball
,
but
*NL*
nice
for
the
object
which
she
now
had
in
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
church
there
was
no
one
but
the
peasants
,
the
servants
and
their
*NL*
women-folk
.
But
Darya
Alexandrovna
saw
,
or
fancied
she
saw
,
the
*NL*
sensation
produced
by
her
children
and
her
.
The
children
were
not
only
*NL*
beautiful
to
look
at
in
their
smart
little
dresses
,
but
they
were
*NL*
charming
in
the
way
they
behaved
.
Aliosha
,
it
is
true
,
did
not
stand
*NL*
quite
correctly
;
he
kept
turning
round
,
trying
to
look
at
his
little
*NL*
jacket
from
behind
;
but
all
the
same
he
was
wonderfully
sweet
.
Tanya
*NL*
behaved
like
a
grownup
person
,
and
looked
after
the
little
ones
.
And
the
*NL*
smallest
,
Lily
,
was
bewitching
in
her
naive
astonishment
at
everything
,
*NL*
and
it
was
difficult
not
to
smile
when
,
after
taking
the
sacrament
,
she
*NL*
said
in
English
,
``
Please
,
some
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
the
children
felt
that
something
solemn
had
happened
,
*NL*
and
were
very
sedate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
went
happily
at
home
too
;
but
at
lunch
Grisha
began
*NL*
whistling
,
and
,
what
was
worse
,
was
disobedient
to
the
English
*NL*
governess
,
and
was
forbidden
to
have
any
tart
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
would
*NL*
not
have
let
things
go
so
far
on
such
a
day
had
she
been
present
;
but
*NL*
she
had
to
support
the
English
governess
's
authority
,
and
she
upheld
her
*NL*
decision
that
Grisha
should
have
no
tart
.
This
rather
spoiled
the
*NL*
general
good
humor
.
Grisha
cried
,
declaring
that
Nikolinka
had
whistled
*NL*
too
,
and
he
was
not
punished
,
and
that
he
was
n't
crying
for
the
tart
--
he
*NL*
did
n't
care
--
but
at
being
unjustly
treated
.
This
was
really
too
tragic
,
*NL*
and
Darya
Alexandrovna
made
up
her
mind
to
persuade
the
English
*NL*
governess
to
forgive
Grisha
,
and
she
went
to
speak
to
her
.
But
on
the
*NL*
way
,
as
she
passed
the
drawing
room
,
she
beheld
a
scene
,
filling
her
*NL*
heart
with
such
pleasure
that
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
she
*NL*
forgave
the
delinquent
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
culprit
was
sitting
at
the
window
in
the
corner
of
the
drawing
room
;
*NL*
beside
him
was
standing
Tanya
with
a
plate
.
On
the
pretext
of
wanting
to
*NL*
give
some
dinner
to
her
dolls
,
she
had
asked
the
governess
's
permission
*NL*
to
take
her
share
of
tart
to
the
nursery
,
and
had
taken
it
instead
to
*NL*
her
brother
.
While
still
weeping
over
the
injustice
of
his
punishment
,
*NL*
he
was
eating
the
tart
,
and
kept
saying
through
his
sobs
,
``
Eat
yourself
;
*NL*
let
's
eat
it
together
...
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tanya
had
at
first
been
under
the
influence
of
her
pity
for
Grisha
,
then
*NL*
of
a
sense
of
her
noble
action
,
and
tears
were
standing
in
her
eyes
too
;
*NL*
but
she
did
not
refuse
,
and
ate
her
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
catching
sight
of
their
mother
they
were
dismayed
,
but
,
looking
into
*NL*
her
face
,
they
saw
they
were
not
doing
wrong
.
They
burst
out
laughing
,
*NL*
and
,
with
their
mouths
full
of
tart
,
they
began
wiping
their
smiling
*NL*
lips
with
their
hands
,
and
smearing
their
radiant
faces
all
over
with
*NL*
tears
and
jam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
Your
new
white
frock
!
Tanya
!
Grisha
!
''
said
their
mother
,
trying
*NL*
to
save
the
frock
,
but
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
smiling
a
blissful
,
*NL*
rapturous
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
frocks
were
taken
off
,
and
orders
were
given
for
the
little
*NL*
girls
to
have
their
blouses
put
on
,
and
the
boys
their
old
jackets
,
and
*NL*
the
wagonette
to
be
harnessed
;
with
Brownie
,
to
the
bailiff
's
annoyance
,
*NL*
again
in
the
shafts
,
to
drive
out
for
mushroom
picking
and
bathing
.
A
*NL*
roar
of
delighted
shrieks
arose
in
the
nursery
,
and
never
ceased
till
*NL*
they
had
set
off
for
the
bathing-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gathered
a
whole
basketful
of
mushrooms
;
even
Lily
found
a
birch
*NL*
mushroom
.
It
had
always
happened
before
that
Miss
Hoole
found
them
and
*NL*
pointed
them
out
to
her
;
but
this
time
she
found
a
big
one
quite
of
*NL*
herself
,
and
there
was
a
general
scream
of
delight
,
``
Lily
has
found
a
*NL*
mushroom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
reached
the
river
,
put
the
horses
under
the
birch
trees
,
and
*NL*
went
to
the
bathing-place
.
The
coachman
,
Terenty
,
fastened
the
horses
,
*NL*
who
kept
whisking
away
the
flies
,
to
a
tree
,
and
,
treading
down
the
*NL*
grass
,
lay
down
in
the
shade
of
a
birch
and
smoked
his
shag
,
while
the
*NL*
never-ceasing
shrieks
of
delight
of
the
children
floated
across
to
him
*NL*
from
the
bathing-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
hard
work
to
look
after
all
the
children
and
restrain
*NL*
their
wild
pranks
,
though
it
was
difficult
too
to
keep
in
one
's
head
and
*NL*
not
mix
up
all
the
stockings
,
little
breeches
,
and
shoes
for
the
*NL*
different
legs
,
and
to
undo
and
to
do
up
again
all
the
tapes
and
*NL*
buttons
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
who
had
always
liked
bathing
herself
,
and
*NL*
believed
it
to
be
very
good
for
the
children
,
enjoyed
nothing
so
much
as
*NL*
bathing
with
all
the
children
.
To
go
over
all
those
fat
little
legs
,
*NL*
pulling
on
their
stockings
,
to
take
in
her
arms
and
dip
those
little
*NL*
naked
bodies
,
and
to
hear
their
screams
of
delight
and
alarm
,
to
see
the
*NL*
breathless
faces
with
wide-open
,
scared
,
and
happy
eyes
of
all
her
*NL*
splashing
cherubs
,
was
a
great
pleasure
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
half
the
children
had
been
dressed
,
some
peasant
women
in
holiday
*NL*
dress
,
out
picking
herbs
,
came
up
to
the
bathing-shed
and
stopped
shyly
.
*NL*
Marya
Philimonovna
called
one
of
them
and
handed
her
a
sheet
and
a
shirt
*NL*
that
had
dropped
into
the
water
for
her
to
dry
them
,
and
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
began
to
talk
to
the
women
.
At
first
they
laughed
behind
*NL*
their
hands
and
did
not
understand
her
questions
,
but
soon
they
grew
*NL*
bolder
and
began
to
talk
,
winning
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
heart
at
once
by
*NL*
the
genuine
admiration
of
the
children
that
they
showed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
,
what
a
beauty
!
as
white
as
sugar
,
''
said
one
,
admiring
Tanitchka
,
*NL*
and
shaking
her
head
;
``
but
thin
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
has
been
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
they
've
been
bathing
you
too
,
''
said
another
to
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
's
only
three
months
old
,
''
answered
Darya
Alexandrovna
with
*NL*
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
any
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
four
;
I
've
two
living
--
a
boy
and
a
girl
.
I
weaned
her
last
*NL*
carnival
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
two
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
nurse
her
so
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
our
custom
;
for
three
fasts
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
conversation
became
most
interesting
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
What
*NL*
sort
of
time
did
she
have
?
What
was
the
matter
with
the
boy
?
Where
was
*NL*
her
husband
?
Did
it
often
happen
?
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
felt
disinclined
to
leave
the
peasant
women
,
so
*NL*
interesting
to
her
was
their
conversation
,
so
completely
identical
were
*NL*
all
their
interests
.
What
pleased
her
most
of
all
was
that
she
saw
*NL*
clearly
what
all
the
women
admired
more
than
anything
was
her
having
so
*NL*
many
children
,
and
such
fine
ones
.
The
peasant
women
even
made
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
laugh
,
and
offended
the
English
governess
,
because
she
was
*NL*
the
cause
of
the
laughter
she
did
not
understand
.
One
of
the
younger
*NL*
women
kept
staring
at
the
Englishwoman
,
who
was
dressing
after
all
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
when
she
put
on
her
third
petticoat
she
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
the
remark
,
``
My
,
she
keeps
putting
on
and
putting
on
,
and
she
'll
never
*NL*
have
done
!

she
said
,
and
they
all
went
off
into
roars

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
drive
home
,
as
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
with
all
her
children
round
*NL*
her
,
their
heads
still
wet
from
their
bath
,
and
a
kerchief
tied
over
her
*NL*
own
head
,
was
getting
near
the
house
,
the
coachman
said
,
``
There
's
some
*NL*
gentleman
coming
:
the
master
of
Pokrovskoe
,
I
do
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
peeped
out
in
front
,
and
was
delighted
when
she
*NL*
recognized
in
the
gray
hat
and
gray
coat
the
familiar
figure
of
Levin
*NL*
walking
to
meet
them
.
She
was
glad
to
see
him
at
any
time
,
but
at
this
*NL*
moment
she
was
specially
glad
he
should
see
her
in
all
her
glory
.
No
one
*NL*
was
better
able
to
appreciate
her
grandeur
than
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
her
,
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
pictures
of
*NL*
his
daydream
of
family
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
like
a
hen
with
your
chickens
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
''
she
said
,
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
see
me
,
but
you
did
n't
let
me
know
.
My
brother
's
staying
with
*NL*
me
.
I
got
a
note
from
Stiva
that
you
were
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Stiva
?
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
asked
with
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
writes
that
you
are
here
,
and
that
he
thinks
you
might
allow
me
*NL*
to
be
of
use
to
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
and
as
he
said
it
he
became
suddenly
*NL*
embarrassed
,
and
,
stopping
abruptly
,
he
walked
on
in
silence
by
the
*NL*
wagonette
,
snapping
off
the
buds
of
the
lime
trees
and
nibbling
them
.
He
*NL*
was
embarrassed
through
a
sense
that
Darya
Alexandrovna
would
be
annoyed
*NL*
by
receiving
from
an
outsider
help
that
should
by
rights
have
come
from
*NL*
her
own
husband
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
certainly
did
not
like
this
little
*NL*
way
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
of
foisting
his
domestic
duties
on
others
.
*NL*
And
she
was
at
once
aware
that
Levin
was
aware
of
this
.
It
was
just
for
*NL*
this
fineness
of
perception
,
for
this
delicacy
,
that
Darya
Alexandrovna
*NL*
liked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
of
course
,
''
said
Levin
,
``
that
that
simply
means
that
you
would
*NL*
like
to
see
me
,
and
I
'm
exceedingly
glad
.
Though
I
can
fancy
that
,
used
*NL*
to
town
housekeeping
as
you
are
,
you
must
feel
in
the
wilds
here
,
and
if
*NL*
there
's
anything
wanted
,
I
'm
altogether
at
your
disposal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
said
Dolly
.
``
At
first
things
were
rather
uncomfortable
,
but
*NL*
now
we
've
settled
everything
capitally
--
thanks
to
my
old
nurse
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
indicating
Marya
Philimonovna
,
who
,
seeing
that
they
were
speaking
*NL*
of
her
,
smiled
brightly
and
cordially
to
Levin
.
She
knew
him
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
he
would
be
a
good
match
for
her
young
lady
,
and
was
very
keen
to
*NL*
see
the
matter
settled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
get
in
,
sir
,
we
'll
make
room
this
side
!
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
walk
.
Children
,
who
'd
like
to
race
the
horses
with
me
?
''
The
*NL*
children
knew
Levin
very
little
,
and
could
not
remember
when
they
had
*NL*
seen
him
,
but
they
experienced
in
regard
to
him
none
of
that
strange
*NL*
feeling
of
shyness
and
hostility
which
children
so
often
experience
*NL*
towards
hypocritical
,
grown-up
people
,
and
for
which
they
are
so
often
*NL*
and
miserably
punished
.
Hypocrisy
in
anything
whatever
may
deceive
the
*NL*
cleverest
and
most
penetrating
man
,
but
the
least
wide-awake
of
children
*NL*
recognizes
it
,
and
is
revolted
by
it
,
however
ingeniously
it
may
be
*NL*
disguised
.
Whatever
faults
Levin
had
,
there
was
not
a
trace
of
hypocrisy
*NL*
in
him
,
and
so
the
children
showed
him
the
same
friendliness
that
they
*NL*
saw
in
their
mother
's
face
.
On
his
invitation
,
the
two
elder
ones
at
*NL*
once
jumped
out
to
him
and
ran
with
him
as
simply
as
they
would
have
*NL*
done
with
their
nurse
or
Miss
Hoole
or
their
mother
.
Lily
,
too
,
began
*NL*
begging
to
go
to
him
,
and
her
mother
handed
her
to
him
;
he
sat
her
on
*NL*
his
shoulder
and
ran
along
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
do
n't
be
afraid
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
*NL*
good-humoredly
to
the
mother
;
``
there
's
no
chance
of
my
hurting
or
*NL*
dropping
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
looking
at
his
strong
,
agile
,
assiduously
careful
and
needlessly
*NL*
wary
movements
,
the
mother
felt
her
mind
at
rest
,
and
smiled
gaily
and
*NL*
approvingly
as
she
watched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
in
the
country
,
with
children
,
and
with
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
with
*NL*
whom
he
was
in
sympathy
,
Levin
was
in
a
mood
not
infrequent
with
him
,
of
*NL*
childlike
light-heartedness
that
she
particularly
liked
in
him
.
As
he
*NL*
ran
with
the
children
,
he
taught
them
gymnastic
feats
,
set
Miss
Hoole
*NL*
laughing
with
his
queer
English
accent
,
and
talked
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
*NL*
of
his
pursuits
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
sitting
alone
with
him
on
the
balcony
,
*NL*
began
to
speak
of
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Kitty
's
coming
here
,
and
is
going
to
spend
the
summer
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
he
said
,
flushing
,
and
at
once
,
to
change
the
conversation
,
he
*NL*
said
:
``
Then
I
'll
send
you
two
cows
,
shall
I
?
If
you
insist
on
a
bill
you
*NL*
shall
pay
me
five
roubles
a
month
;
but
it
's
really
too
bad
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
We
can
manage
very
well
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
then
,
I
'll
have
a
look
at
your
cows
,
and
if
you
'll
allow
me
,
*NL*
I
'll
give
directions
about
their
food
.
Everything
depends
on
their
*NL*
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
,
to
turn
the
conversation
,
explained
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
the
*NL*
theory
of
cow-keeping
,
based
on
the
principle
that
the
cow
is
simply
a
*NL*
machine
for
the
transformation
of
food
into
milk
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
of
this
,
and
passionately
longed
to
hear
more
of
Kitty
,
and
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
was
afraid
of
hearing
it
.
He
dreaded
the
breaking
up
*NL*
of
the
inward
peace
he
had
gained
with
such
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
still
all
this
has
to
be
looked
after
,
and
who
is
there
to
*NL*
look
after
it
?
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
responded
,
without
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
by
now
got
her
household
matters
so
satisfactorily
arranged
,
*NL*
thanks
to
Marya
Philimonovna
,
that
she
was
disinclined
to
make
any
*NL*
change
in
them
;
besides
,
she
had
no
faith
in
Levin
's
knowledge
of
*NL*
farming
.
General
principles
,
as
to
the
cow
being
a
machine
for
the
*NL*
production
of
milk
,
she
looked
on
with
suspicion
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
such
principles
could
only
be
a
hindrance
in
farm
management
.
It
all
*NL*
seemed
to
her
a
far
simpler
matter
:
all
that
was
needed
,
as
Marya
*NL*
Philimonovna
had
explained
,
was
to
give
Brindle
and
Whitebreast
more
*NL*
food
and
drink
,
and
not
to
let
the
cook
carry
all
the
kitchen
slops
to
*NL*
the
laundry
maid
's
cow
.
That
was
clear
.
But
general
propositions
as
to
*NL*
feeding
on
meal
and
on
grass
were
doubtful
and
obscure
.
And
,
what
was
*NL*
most
important
,
she
wanted
to
talk
about
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Kitty
writes
to
me
that
there
's
nothing
she
longs
for
so
much
as
quiet
*NL*
and
solitude
,
''
Dolly
said
after
the
silence
that
had
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
she
--
better
?
''
Levin
asked
in
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
she
's
quite
well
again
.
I
never
believed
her
lungs
were
*NL*
affected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
very
glad
!
''
said
Levin
,
and
Dolly
fancied
she
saw
something
*NL*
touching
,
helpless
,
in
his
face
as
he
said
this
and
looked
silently
into
*NL*
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
ask
you
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
smiling
her
kindly
and
rather
mocking
smile
,
``
why
is
it
you
are
angry
*NL*
with
Kitty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
'm
not
angry
with
her
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
angry

Why
was
it
you
did
not
come
to
see
us
nor
them
when
*NL*
you
were
in
Moscow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
''
he
said
,
blushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
,
``
I
*NL*
wonder
really
that
with
your
kind
heart
you
do
n't
feel

How
it

feel
no
pity

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
Levin
,
and
all
*NL*
the
tenderness
he
had
been
feeling
for
Kitty
a
minute
before
was
*NL*
replaced
by
a
feeling
of
anger
for
the
slight
he
had
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
suppose
I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
everybody

All

never

And

sitting

at

feeling
rise
up

within

a

*NL*
The
feeling
that
had
seemed
dead
revived
more

more

rose
up
and
took
*NL*
possession
of
Levin

heart

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Ah

said
Darya

,
as
though
despising
him
for
*NL*
the
baseness
of
this

in

with
that

At

*NL*
*NL*
Levin
recalled

whether

that

any

I

all

*NL*
*NL*

Levin

jumping
up
.
``
If

It

just

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

said
Darya

looking
with
mournful

tenderness
at
Levin

excitement

``
Yes

I
see
it

she
went
on
musingly

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very

very
absurd

repeated
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
looking
with
*NL*
tenderness
into
his
face
.
``
Very
well
then

let
it
be
as

had
*NL*
not

What
have

come
for

Tanya

she
said
in
French
*NL*
to
the
little

who
had
come
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

my

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
speak

*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
tried
to
say
it
in
French
,
but
could
not
remember
the
*NL*
French
for
spade
;
the
mother
prompted
her
,
and
then
told
her
in
French
*NL*
where
to
look
for
the
spade

And
this
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
*NL*
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
in
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
house
and
children
struck
him
now
as
*NL*
by
no
means
so
charming
as
a
little
while
before
.
``
And
what
does
she
*NL*
talk
French
with
the
children
for
?
''
he
thought
;
``
how
unnatural
and
false
*NL*
it
is
!
And
the
children
feel
it
so
:
Learning
French
and
unlearning
*NL*
sincerity
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
unaware
that
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
*NL*
thought
all
that
over
twenty
times
already
,
and
yet
,
even
at
the
cost
of
*NL*
some
loss
of
sincerity
,
believed
it
necessary
to
teach
her
children
*NL*
French
in
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
going
?
Do
stay
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
stayed
to
tea
;
but
his
good-humor
had
vanished
,
and
he
felt
ill
at
*NL*
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
he
went
out
into
the
hall
to
order
his
horses
to
be
put
in
,
*NL*
and
,
when
he
came
back
,
he
found
Darya
Alexandrovna
greatly
disturbed
,
*NL*
with
a
troubled
face
,
and
tears
in
her
eyes
.
While
Levin
had
been
*NL*
outside
,
an
incident
had
occurred
which
had
utterly
shattered
all
the
*NL*
happiness
she
had
been
feeling
that
day
,
and
her
pride
in
her
children
.
*NL*
Grisha
and
Tanya
had
been
fighting
over
a
ball
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
hearing
a
scream
in
the
nursery
,
ran
in
and
saw
a
terrible
sight
.
Tanya
*NL*
was
pulling
Grisha
's
hair
,
while
he
,
with
a
face
hideous
with
rage
,
was
*NL*
beating
her
with
his
fists
wherever
he
could
get
at
her
.
Something
*NL*
snapped
in
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
heart
when
she
saw
this
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
darkness
had
swooped
down
upon
her
life
;
she
felt
that
these
children
of
*NL*
hers
,
that
she
was
so
proud
of
,
were
not
merely
most
ordinary
,
but
*NL*
positively
bad
,
ill-bred
children
,
with
coarse
,
brutal
*NL*
propensities
--
wicked
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
talk
or
think
of
anything
else
,
and
she
could
not
speak
to
*NL*
Levin
of
her
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
saw
she
was
unhappy
and
tried
to
comfort
her
,
saying
that
it
*NL*
showed
nothing
bad
,
that
all
children
fight
;
but
,
even
as
he
said
it
,
he
*NL*
was
thinking
in
his
heart
:
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
be
artificial
and
talk
French
*NL*
with
my
children
;
but
my
children
wo
n't
be
like
that
.
All
one
has
to
do
*NL*
is
not
spoil
children
,
not
to
distort
their
nature
,
and
they
'll
be
*NL*
delightful
.
No
,
my
children
wo
n't
be
like
that
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
said
good-bye
and
drove
away
,
and
she
did
not
try
to
keep
him

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
July
the
elder
of
the
village
on
Levin
's
sister
's
*NL*
estate
,
about
fifteen
miles
from
Pokrovskoe
,
came
to
Levin
to
report
on
*NL*
how
things
were
going
there
and
on
the
hay
.
The
chief
source
of
income
*NL*
on
his
sister
's
estate
was
from
the
riverside
meadows
.
In
former
years
*NL*
the
hay
had
been
bought
by
the
peasants
for
twenty
roubles
the
three
*NL*
acres
.
When
Levin
took
over
the
management
of
the
estate
,
he
thought
on
*NL*
examining
the
grasslands
that
they
were
worth
more
,
and
he
fixed
the
*NL*
price
at
twenty-five
roubles
the
three
acres
.
The
peasants
would
not
*NL*
give
that
price
,
and
,
as
Levin
suspected
,
kept
off
other
purchasers
.
*NL*
Then
Levin
had
driven
over
himself
,
and
arranged
to
have
the
grass
cut
,
*NL*
partly
by
hired
labor
,
partly
at
a
payment
of
a
certain
proportion
of
*NL*
the
crop
.
His
own
peasants
put
every
hindrance
they
could
in
the
way
of
*NL*
this
new
arrangement
,
but
it
was
carried
out
,
and
the
first
year
the
*NL*
meadows
had
yielded
a
profit
almost
double
.
The
previous
year
--
which
was
*NL*
the
third
year
--
the
peasants
had
maintained
the
same
opposition
to
the
*NL*
arrangement
,
and
the
hay
had
been
cut
on
the
same
system
.
This
year
the
*NL*
peasants
were
doing
all
the
mowing
for
a
third
of
the
hay
crop
,
and
the
*NL*
village
elder
had
come
now
to
announce
that
the
hay
had
been
cut
,
and
*NL*
that
,
fearing
rain
,
they
had
invited
the
counting-house
clerk
over
,
had
*NL*
divided
the
crop
in
his
presence
,
and
had
raked
together
eleven
stacks
*NL*
as
the
owner
's
share
.
From
the
vague
answers
to
his
question
how
much
*NL*
hay
had
been
cut
on
the
principal
meadow
,
from
the
hurry
of
the
village
*NL*
elder
who
had
made
the
division
,
not
asking
leave
,
from
the
whole
tone
*NL*
of
the
peasant
,
Levin
perceived
that
there
was
something
wrong
in
the
*NL*
division
of
the
hay
,
and
made
up
his
mind
to
drive
over
himself
to
look
*NL*
into
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arriving
for
dinner
at
the
village
,
and
leaving
his
horse
at
the
cottage
*NL*
of
an
old
friend
of
his
,
the
husband
of
his
brother
's
wet-nurse
,
Levin
*NL*
went
to
see
the
old
man
in
his
bee-house
,
wanting
to
find
out
from
him
*NL*
the
truth
about
the
hay
.
Parmenitch
,
a
talkative
,
comely
old
man
,
gave
*NL*
Levin
a
very
warm
welcome
,
showed
him
all
he
was
doing
,
told
him
*NL*
everything
about
his
bees
and
the
swarms
of
that
year
;
but
gave
vague
*NL*
and
unwilling
answers
to
Levin
's
inquiries
about
the
mowing
.
This
*NL*
confirmed
Levin
still
more
in
his
suspicions
.
He
went
to
the
hay
fields
*NL*
and
examined
the
stacks
.
The
haystacks
could
not
possibly
contain
fifty
*NL*
wagon-loads
each
,
and
to
convict
the
peasants
Levin
ordered
the
wagons
*NL*
that
had
carried
the
hay
to
be
brought
up
directly
,
to
lift
one
stack
,
*NL*
and
carry
it
into
the
barn
.
There
turned
out
to
be
only
thirty-two
loads
*NL*
in
the
stack
.
In
spite
of
the
village
elder
's
assertions
about
the
*NL*
compressibility
of
hay
,
and
its
having
settled
down
in
the
stacks
,
and
*NL*
his
swearing
that
everything
had
been
done
in
the
fear
of
God
,
Levin
*NL*
stuck
to
his
point
that
the
hay
had
been
divided
without
his
orders
,
and
*NL*
that
,
therefore
,
he
would
not
accept
that
hay
as
fifty
loads
to
a
stack
.
*NL*
After
a
prolonged
dispute
the
matter
was
decided
by
the
peasants
taking
*NL*
these
eleven
stacks
,
reckoning
them
as
fifty
loads
each
.
The
arguments
*NL*
and
the
division
of
the
haycocks
lasted
the
whole
afternoon
.
When
the
*NL*
last
of
the
hay
had
been
divided
,
Levin
,
intrusting
the
superintendence
*NL*
of
the
rest
to
the
counting-house
clerk
,
sat
down
on
a
haycock
marked
*NL*
off
by
a
stake
of
willow
,
and
looked
admiringly
at
the
meadow
swarming
*NL*
with
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
him
,
in
the
bend
of
the
river
beyond
the
marsh
,
moved
a
*NL*
bright-colored
line
of
peasant
women
,
and
the
scattered
hay
was
being
*NL*
rapidly
formed
into
gray
winding
rows
over
the
pale
green
stubble
.
After
*NL*
the
women
came
the
men
with
pitchforks
,
and
from
the
gray
rows
there
*NL*
were
growing
up
broad
,
high
,
soft
haycocks
.
To
the
left
,
carts
were
*NL*
rumbling
over
the
meadow
that
had
been
already
cleared
,
and
one
after
*NL*
another
the
haycocks
vanished
,
flung
up
in
huge
forkfuls
,
and
in
their
*NL*
place
there
were
rising
heavy
cartloads
of
fragrant
hay
hanging
over
the
*NL*
horses
'
hind-quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
weather
for
haying
!
What
hay
it
'll
be
!
''
said
an
old
man
,
squatting
*NL*
down
beside
Levin
.
``
It
's
tea
,
not
hay
!
It
's
like
scattering
grain
to
the
*NL*
ducks
,
the
way
they
pick
it
up
!
''
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
growing
*NL*
haycocks
.
``
Since
dinnertime
they
've
carried
a
good
half
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
load
,
eh
?
''
he
shouted
to
a
young
peasant
,
who
drove
by
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
front
of
an
empty
cart
,
shaking
the
cord
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
,
dad
!
''
the
lad
shouted
back
,
pulling
in
the
horse
,
and
,
*NL*
smiling
,
he
looked
round
at
a
bright
,
rosy-checked
peasant
girl
who
sat
*NL*
in
the
cart
smiling
too
,
and
drove
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
Your
son
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
baby
,
''
said
the
old
man
with
a
tender
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fine
fellow
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lad
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Married
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
two
years
last
St.
Philip
's
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Children
indeed
!
Why
,
for
over
a
year
he
was
innocent
as
a
babe
*NL*
himself
,
and
bashful
too
,
''
answered
the
old
man
.
``
Well
,
the
hay
!
It
's
as
*NL*
fragrant
as
tea
!
''
he
repeated
,
wishing
to
change
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
more
attentively
at
Ivan
Parmenov
and
his
wife
.
They
were
*NL*
loading
a
haycock
onto
the
cart
not
far
from
him
.
Ivan
Parmenov
was
*NL*
standing
on
the
cart
,
taking
,
laying
in
place
,
and
stamping
down
the
*NL*
huge
bundles
of
hay
,
which
his
pretty
young
wife
deftly
handed
up
to
*NL*
him
,
at
first
in
armfuls
,
and
then
on
the
pitchfork
.
The
young
wife
*NL*
worked
easily
,
merrily
,
and
dexterously
.
The
close-packed
hay
did
not
*NL*
once
break
away
off
her
fork
.
First
she
gathered
it
together
,
stuck
the
*NL*
fork
into
it
,
then
with
a
rapid
,
supple
movement
leaned
the
whole
weight
*NL*
of
her
body
on
it
,
and
at
once
with
a
bend
of
her
back
under
the
red
*NL*
belt
she
drew
herself
up
,
and
arching
her
full
bosom
under
the
white
*NL*
smock
,
with
a
smart
turn
swung
the
fork
in
her
arms
,
and
flung
the
*NL*
bundle
of
hay
high
onto
the
cart
.
Ivan
,
obviously
doing
his
best
to
save
*NL*
her
every
minute
of
unnecessary
labor
,
made
haste
,
opening
his
arms
to
*NL*
clutch
the
bundle
and
lay
it
in
the
cart
.
As
she
raked
together
what
was
*NL*
left
of
the
hay
,
the
young
wife
shook
off
the
bits
of
hay
that
had
*NL*
fallen
on
her
neck
,
and
straightening
the
red
kerchief
that
had
dropped
*NL*
forward
over
her
white
brow
,
not
browned
like
her
face
by
the
sun
,
she
*NL*
crept
under
the
cart
to
tie
up
the
load
.
Ivan
directed
her
how
to
fasten
*NL*
the
cord
to
the
cross-piece
,
and
at
something
she
said
he
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
In
the
expressions
of
both
faces
was
to
be
seen
vigorous
,
young
,
freshly
*NL*
awakened
love
.

The
load
was
tied
on
.
Ivan
jumped
down
and
took
the
quiet
,
sleek
horse
*NL*
by
the
bridle
.
The
young
wife
flung
the
rake
up
on
the
load
,
and
with
a
*NL*
bold
step
,
swinging
her
arms
,
she
went
to
join
the
women
,
who
were
*NL*
forming
a
ring
for
the
haymakers
'
dance
.
Ivan
drove
off
to
the
road
and
*NL*
fell
into
line
with
the
other
loaded
carts
.
The
peasant
women
,
with
*NL*
their
rakes
on
their
shoulders
,
gay
with
bright
flowers
,
and
chattering
*NL*
with
ringing
,
merry
voices
,
walked
behind
the
hay
cart
.
One
wild
*NL*
untrained
female
voice
broke
into
a
song
,
and
sang
it
alone
through
a
*NL*
verse
,
and
then
the
same
verse
was
taken
up
and
repeated
by
half
a
*NL*
hundred
strong
healthy
voices
,
of
all
sorts
,
coarse
and
fine
,
singing
in
*NL*
unison
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
,
all
singing
,
began
to
come
close
to
Levin
,
and
he
felt
as
*NL*
though
a
storm
were
swooping
down
upon
him
with
a
thunder
of
merriment
.
*NL*
The
storm
swooped
down
,
enveloped
him
and
the
haycock
on
which
he
was
*NL*
lying
,
and
the
other
haycocks
,
and
the
wagon-loads
,
and
the
whole
meadow
*NL*
and
distant
fields
all
seemed
to
be
shaking
and
singing
to
the
measures
*NL*
of
this
wild
merry
song
with
its
shouts
and
whistles
and
clapping
.
Levin
*NL*
felt
envious
of
this
health
and
mirthfulness
;
he
longed
to
take
part
in
*NL*
the
expression
of
this
joy
of
life
.
But
he
could
do
nothing
,
and
had
to
*NL*
lie
and
look
on
and
listen
.
When
the
peasants
,
with
their
singing
,
had
*NL*
vanished
out
of
sight
and
hearing
,
a
weary
feeling
of
despondency
at
his
*NL*
own
isolation
,
his
physical
inactivity
,
his
alienation
from
this
world
,
*NL*
came
over
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
very
peasants
who
had
been
most
active
in
wrangling
with
him
*NL*
over
the
hay
,
some
whom
he
had
treated
with
contumely
,
and
who
had
tried
*NL*
to
cheat
him
,
those
very
peasants
had
greeted
him
goodhumoredly
,
and
*NL*
evidently
had
not
,
were
incapable
of
having
any
feeling
of
rancor
*NL*
against
him
,
any
regret
,
any
recollection
even
of
having
tried
to
*NL*
deceive
him
.
All
that
was
drowned
in
a
sea
of
merry
common
labor
.
God
*NL*
gave
the
day
,
God
gave
the
strength
.
And
the
day
and
the
strength
were
*NL*
consecrated
to
labor
,
and
that
labor
was
its
own
reward
.
For
whom
the
*NL*
labor
?
What
would
be
its
fruits
?
These
were
idle
considerations
--
beside
*NL*
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
Levin
had
admired
this
life
,
often
he
had
a
sense
of
envy
of
the
*NL*
men
who
led
this
life
;
but
today
for
the
first
time
,
especially
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
attitude
of
Ivan
Parmenov
to
*NL*
his
young
wife
,
the
idea
presented
itself
definitely
to
his
mind
that
it
*NL*
was
in
his
power
to
exchange
the
dreary
,
artificial
,
idle
,
and
*NL*
individualistic
life
he
was
leading
for
this
laborious
,
pure
,
and
*NL*
socially
delightful
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
who
had
been
sitting
beside
him
had
long
ago
gone
home
;
the
*NL*
people
had
all
separated
.
Those
who
lived
near
had
gone
home
,
while
*NL*
those
who
came
from
far
were
gathered
into
a
group
for
supper
,
and
to
*NL*
spend
the
night
in
the
meadow
.
Levin
,
unobserved
by
the
peasants
,
still
*NL*
lay
on
the
haycock
,
and
still
looked
on
and
listened
and
mused
.
The
*NL*
peasants
who
remained
for
the
night
in
the
meadow
scarcely
slept
all
the
*NL*
short
summer
night
.
At
first
there
was
the
sound
of
merry
talk
and
*NL*
laughing
all
together
over
the
supper
,
then
singing
again
and
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
long
day
of
toil
had
left
no
trace
in
them
but
lightness
of
*NL*
heart
.
Before
the
early
dawn
all
was
hushed
.
Nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
*NL*
the
night
sounds
of
the
frogs
that
never
ceased
in
the
marsh
,
and
the
*NL*
horses
snorting
in
the
mist
that
rose
over
the
meadow
before
the
*NL*
morning
.
Rousing
himself
,
Levin
got
up
from
the
haycock
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
the
stars
,
he
saw
that
the
night
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
am
I
going
to
do
?
How
am
I
to
set
about
it
?
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
trying
to
express
to
himself
all
the
thoughts
and
feelings
he
*NL*
had
passed
through
in
that
brief
night
.
All
the
thoughts
and
feelings
he
*NL*
had
passed
through
fell
into
three
separate
trains
of
thought
.
One
was
*NL*
the
renunciation
of
his
old
life
,
of
his
utterly
useless
education
.
This
*NL*
renunciation
gave
him
satisfaction
,
and
was
easy
and
simple
.
Another
*NL*
series
of
thoughts
and
mental
images
related
to
the
life
he
longed
to
*NL*
live
now
.
The
simplicity
,
the
purity
,
the
sanity
of
this
life
he
felt
*NL*
clearly
,
and
he
was
convinced
he
would
find
in
it
the
content
,
the
*NL*
peace
,
and
the
dignity
,
of
the
lack
of
which
he
was
so
miserably
*NL*
conscious
.
But
a
third
series
of
ideas
turned
upon
the
question
how
to
*NL*
effect
this
transition
from
the
old
life
to
the
new
.
And
there
nothing
*NL*
took
clear
shape
for
him
.
``
Have
a
wife
?
Have
work
and
the
necessity
of
*NL*
work
?
Leave
Pokrovskoe
?
Buy
land
?
Become
a
member
of
a
peasant
*NL*
community
?
Marry
a
peasant
girl
?
How
am
I
to
set
about
it
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
himself
again
,
and
could
not
find
an
answer
.
``
I
have
n't
slept
all
night
,
*NL*
though
,
and
I
ca
n't
think
it
out
clearly
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
work
it
out
later
.
One
thing
's
certain
,
this
night
has
decided
my
fate
.
*NL*
All
my
old
dreams
of
home
life
were
absurd
,
not
the
real
thing
,
''
he
told
*NL*
himself
.
``
It
's
all
ever
so
much
simpler
and
better
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
!
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
the
strange
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
mother-of-pearl
shell
of
white
fleecy
cloudlets
resting
right
over
his
*NL*
head
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
.
``
How
exquisite
it
all
is
in
this
*NL*
exquisite
night
!
And
when
was
there
time
for
that
cloud-shell
to
form
?
*NL*
Just
now
I
looked
at
the
sky
,
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
--
only
two
*NL*
white
streaks
.
Yes
,
and
so
imperceptibly
too
my
views
of
life
changed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
of
the
meadow
and
walked
along
the
highroad
towards
the
*NL*
village
.
A
slight
wind
arose
,
and
the
sky
looked
gray
and
sullen
.
The
*NL*
gloomy
moment
had
come
that
usually
precedes
the
dawn
,
the
full
triumph
*NL*
of
light
over
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shrinking
from
the
cold
,
Levin
walked
rapidly
,
looking
at
the
ground
.
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
Someone
coming
,
''
he
thought
,
catching
the
tinkle
of
bells
,
*NL*
and
lifting
his
head
.
Forty
paces
from
him
a
carriage
with
four
horses
*NL*
harnessed
abreast
was
driving
towards
him
along
the
grassy
road
on
which
*NL*
he
was
walking
.
The
shaft-horses
were
tilted
against
the
shafts
by
the
*NL*
ruts
,
but
the
dexterous
driver
sitting
on
the
box
held
the
shaft
over
*NL*
the
ruts
,
so
that
the
wheels
ran
on
the
smooth
part
of
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
Levin
noticed
,
and
without
wondering
who
it
could
be
,
he
*NL*
gazed
absently
at
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
coach
was
an
old
lady
dozing
in
one
corner
,
and
at
the
window
,
*NL*
evidently
only
just
awake
,
sat
a
young
girl
holding
in
both
hands
the
*NL*
ribbons
of
a
white
cap
.
With
a
face
full
of
light
and
thought
,
full
of
a
*NL*
subtle
,
complex
inner
life
,
that
was
remote
from
Levin
,
she
was
gazing
*NL*
beyond
him
at
the
glow
of
the
sunrise
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
instant
when
this
apparition
was
vanishing
,
the
truthful
*NL*
eyes
glanced
at
him
.
She
recognized
him
,
and
her
face
lighted
up
with
*NL*
wondering
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
be
mistaken
.
There
were
no
other
eyes
like
those
in
the
*NL*
world
.
There
was
only
one
creature
in
the
world
that
could
concentrate
*NL*
for
him
all
the
brightness
and
meaning
of
life
.
It
was
she
.
It
was
*NL*
Kitty
.
He
understood
that
she
was
driving
to
Ergushovo
from
the
railway
*NL*
station
.
And
everything
that
had
been
stirring
Levin
during
that
*NL*
sleepless
night
,
all
the
resolutions
he
had
made
,
all
vanished
at
once
.
*NL*
He
recalled
with
horror
his
dreams
of
marrying
a
peasant
girl
.
There
*NL*
only
,
in
the
carriage
that
had
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
road
,
and
was
rapidly
disappearing
,
there
only
could
he
find
the
*NL*
solution
of
the
riddle
of
his
life
,
which
had
weighed
so
agonizingly
*NL*
upon
him
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
look
out
again
.
The
sound
of
the
carriage-springs
was
no
*NL*
longer
audible
,
the
bells
could
scarcely
be
heard
.
The
barking
of
dogs
*NL*
showed
the
carriage
had
reached
the
village
,
and
all
that
was
left
was
*NL*
the
empty
fields
all
round
,
the
village
in
front
,
and
he
himself
*NL*
isolated
and
apart
from
it
all
,
wandering
lonely
along
the
deserted
*NL*
highroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
the
sky
,
expecting
to
find
there
the
cloud
shell
he
had
*NL*
been
admiring
and
taking
as
the
symbol
of
the
ideas
and
feelings
of
that
*NL*
night
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
sky
in
the
least
like
a
shell
.
There
,
in
*NL*
the
remote
heights
above
,
a
mysterious
change
had
been
accomplished
.
*NL*
There
was
no
trace
of
shell
,
and
there
was
stretched
over
fully
half
the
*NL*
sky
an
even
cover
of
tiny
and
ever
tinier
cloudlets
.
The
sky
had
grown
*NL*
blue
and
bright
;
and
with
the
same
softness
,
but
with
the
same
*NL*
remoteness
,
it
met
his
questioning
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
however
good
that
life
of
simplicity
and
toil
*NL*
may
be
,
I
can
not
go
back
to
it
.
I
love
_
her

*NL*
*NL*
None
but
those
who
were
most
intimate
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
knew
*NL*
that
,
while
on
the
surface
the
coldest
and
most
reasonable
of
men
,
he
*NL*
had
one
weakness
quite
opposed
to
the
general
trend
of
his
character
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
could
not
hear
or
see
a
child
or
woman
crying
*NL*
without
being
moved
.
The
sight
of
tears
threw
him
into
a
state
of
*NL*
nervous
agitation
,
and
he
utterly
lost
all
power
of
reflection
.
The
*NL*
chief
secretary
of
his
department
and
his
private
secretary
were
aware
*NL*
of
this
,
and
used
to
warn
women
who
came
with
petitions
on
no
account
to
*NL*
give
way
to
tears
,
if
they
did
not
want
to
ruin
their
chances
.
``
He
will
*NL*
get
angry
,
and
will
not
listen
to
you
,
''
they
used
to
say
.
And
as
a
fact
,
*NL*
in
such
cases
the
emotional
disturbance
set
up
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
by
the
sight
of
tears
found
expression
in
hasty
anger
.
``
I
can
do
*NL*
nothing
.
Kindly
leave
the
room
!
''
he
would
commonly
cry
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
returning
from
the
races
Anna
had
informed
him
of
her
relations
*NL*
with
Vronsky
,
and
immediately
afterwards
had
burst
into
tears
,
hiding
*NL*
her
face
in
her
hands
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
for
all
the
fury
aroused
*NL*
in
him
against
her
,
was
aware
at
the
same
time
of
a
rush
of
that
*NL*
emotional
disturbance
always
produced
in
him
by
tears
.
Conscious
of
it
,
*NL*
and
conscious
that
any
expression
of
his
feelings
at
that
minute
would
*NL*
be
out
of
keeping
with
the
position
,
he
tried
to
suppress
every
*NL*
manifestation
of
life
in
himself
,
and
so
neither
stirred
nor
looked
at
*NL*
her
.
This
was
what
had
caused
that
strange
expression
of
deathlike
*NL*
rigidity
in
his
face
which
had
so
impressed
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
house
he
helped
her
to
get
out
of
the
carriage
,
*NL*
and
making
an
effort
to
master
himself
,
took
leave
of
her
with
his
usual
*NL*
urbanity
,
and
uttered
that
phrase
that
bound
him
to
nothing
;
he
said
*NL*
that
tomorrow
he
would
let
her
know
his
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
's
words
,
confirming
his
worst
suspicions
,
had
sent
a
cruel
pang
*NL*
to
the
heart
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
That
pang
was
intensified
by
the
*NL*
strange
feeling
of
physical
pity
for
her
set
up
by
her
tears
.
But
when
*NL*
he
was
all
alone
in
the
carriage
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
to
his
surprise
*NL*
and
delight
,
felt
complete
relief
both
from
this
pity
and
from
the
*NL*
doubts
and
agonies
of
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
experienced
the
sensations
of
a
man
who
has
had
a
tooth
out
after
*NL*
suffering
long
from
toothache
.
After
a
fearful
agony
and
a
sense
of
*NL*
something
huge
,
bigger
than
the
head
itself
,
being
torn
out
of
his
jaw
,
*NL*
the
sufferer
,
hardly
able
to
believe
in
his
own
good
luck
,
feels
all
at
*NL*
once
that
what
has
so
long
poisoned
his
existence
and
enchained
his
*NL*
attention
,
exists
no
longer
,
and
that
he
can
live
and
think
again
,
and
*NL*
take
interest
in
other
things
besides
his
tooth
.
This
feeling
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
experiencing
.
The
agony
had
been
strange
and
*NL*
terrible
,
but
now
it
was
over
;
he
felt
that
he
could
live
again
and
*NL*
think
of
something
other
than
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
honor
,
no
heart
,
no
religion
;
a
corrupt
woman
.
I
always
knew
it
and
*NL*
always
saw
it
,
though
I
tried
to
deceive
myself
to
spare
her
,
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
.
And
it
actually
seemed
to
him
that
he
always
had
seen
it
:
he
*NL*
recalled
incidents
of
their
past
life
,
in
which
he
had
never
seen
*NL*
anything
wrong
before
--
now
these
incidents
proved
clearly
that
she
had
*NL*
always
been
a
corrupt
woman
.
``
I
made
a
mistake
in
linking
my
life
to
*NL*
hers
;
but
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
my
mistake
,
and
so
I
can
not
be
*NL*
unhappy
.
It
's
not
I
that
am
to
blame
,
''
he
told
himself
,
``
but
she
.
But
I
*NL*
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
.
She
does
not
exist
for
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
relating
to
her
and
her
son
,
towards
whom
his
sentiments
were
*NL*
as
much
changed
as
towards
her
,
ceased
to
interest
him
.
The
only
thing
*NL*
that
interested
him
now
was
the
question
of
in
what
way
he
could
best
,
*NL*
with
most
propriety
and
comfort
for
himself
,
and
thus
with
most
justice
,
*NL*
extricate
himself
from
the
mud
with
which
she
had
spattered
him
in
her
*NL*
fall
,
and
then
proceed
along
his
path
of
active
,
honorable
,
and
useful
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
be
made
unhappy
by
the
fact
that
a
contemptible
woman
has
*NL*
committed
a
crime
.
I
have
only
to
find
the
best
way
out
of
the
difficult
*NL*
position
in
which
she
has
placed
me
.
And
I
shall
find
it
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
frowning
more
and
more
.
``
I
'm
not
the
first
nor
the
last
.
''
And
*NL*
to
say
nothing
of
historical
instances
dating
from
the
``
Fair
Helen
''
of
*NL*
Menelaus
,
recently
revived
in
the
memory
of
all
,
a
whole
list
of
*NL*
contemporary
examples
of
husbands
with
unfaithful
wives
in
the
highest
*NL*
society
rose
before
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
imagination
.
``
Daryalov
,
*NL*
Poltavsky
,
Prince
Karibanov
,
Count
Paskudin
,
Dram
...
Yes
,
even
Dram
,
*NL*
such
an
honest
,
capable
fellow
...
Semyonov
,
Tchagin
,
Sigonin
,
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
remembered
.
``
Admitting
that
a
certain
quite
irrational
*NL*
_
ridicule
_
falls
to
the
lot
of
these
men
,
yet
I
never
saw
anything
but
a
*NL*
misfortune
in
it
,
and
always
felt
sympathy
for
it
,
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
said
to
himself
,
though
indeed
this
was
not
the
fact
,
and
*NL*
he
had
never
felt
sympathy
for
misfortunes
of
that
kind
,
but
the
more
*NL*
frequently
he
had
heard
of
instances
of
unfaithful
wives
betraying
their
*NL*
husbands
,
the
more
highly
he
had
thought
of
himself
.
``
It
is
a
misfortune
*NL*
which
may
befall
anyone
.
And
this
misfortune
has
befallen
me
.
The
only
*NL*
thing
to
be
done
is
to
make
the
best
of
the
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
passing
in
review
the
methods
of
proceeding
of
men
who
had
*NL*
been
in
the
same
position
that
he
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daryalov
fought
a
duel
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
duel
had
particularly
fascinated
the
thoughts
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
in
his
youth
,
just
because
he
was
physically
a
coward
,
*NL*
and
was
himself
well
aware
of
the
fact
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
could
not
*NL*
without
horror
contemplate
the
idea
of
a
pistol
aimed
at
himself
,
and
*NL*
had
never
made
use
of
any
weapon
in
his
life
.
This
horror
had
in
his
*NL*
youth
set
him
pondering
on
dueling
,
and
picturing
himself
in
a
position
*NL*
in
which
he
would
have
to
expose
his
life
to
danger
.
Having
attained
*NL*
success
and
an
established
position
in
the
world
,
he
had
long
ago
*NL*
forgotten
this
feeling
;
but
the
habitual
bent
of
feeling
reasserted
*NL*
itself
,
and
dread
of
his
own
cowardice
proved
even
now
so
strong
that
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
spent
a
long
while
thinking
over
the
question
of
*NL*
dueling
in
all
its
aspects
,
and
hugging
the
idea
of
a
duel
,
though
he
*NL*
was
fully
aware
beforehand
that
he
would
never
under
any
circumstances
*NL*
fight
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
doubt
our
society
is
still
so
barbarous
-LRB-
it
's
not
the
same
*NL*
in
England
-RRB-
that
very
many
''
--
and
among
these
were
those
whose
opinion
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
particularly
valued
--
``
look
favorably
on
the
duel
;
*NL*
but
what
result
is
attained
by
it
?
Suppose
I
call
him
out
,
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
went
on
to
himself
,
and
vividly
picturing
the
night
he
*NL*
would
spend
after
the
challenge
,
and
the
pistol
aimed
at
him
,
he
*NL*
shuddered
,
and
knew
that
he
never
would
do
it
--
``
suppose
I
call
him
out
.
*NL*
Suppose
I
am
taught
,
''
he
went
on
musing
,
``
to
shoot
;
I
press
the
*NL*
trigger
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
closing
his
eyes
,
``
and
it
turns
out
I
have
*NL*
killed
him
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
to
himself
,
and
he
shook
his
*NL*
head
as
though
to
dispel
such
silly
ideas
.
``
What
sense
is
there
in
*NL*
murdering
a
man
in
order
to
define
one
's
relation
to
a
guilty
wife
and
*NL*
son
?
I
should
still
just
as
much
have
to
decide
what
I
ought
to
do
with
*NL*
her
.
But
what
is
more
probable
and
what
would
doubtless
occur
--
I
should
*NL*
be
killed
or
wounded
.
I
,
the
innocent
person
,
should
be
the
*NL*
victim
--
killed
or
wounded
.
It
's
even
more
senseless
.
But
apart
from
*NL*
that
,
a
challenge
to
fight
would
be
an
act
hardly
honest
on
my
side
.
*NL*
Do
n't
I
know
perfectly
well
that
my
friends
would
never
allow
me
to
*NL*
fight
a
duel
--
would
never
allow
the
life
of
a
statesman
,
needed
by
*NL*
Russia
,
to
be
exposed
to
danger
?
Knowing
perfectly
well
beforehand
that
*NL*
the
matter
would
never
come
to
real
danger
,
it
would
amount
to
my
simply
*NL*
trying
to
gain
a
certain
sham
reputation
by
such
a
challenge
.
That
would
*NL*
be
dishonest
,
that
would
be
false
,
that
would
be
deceiving
myself
and
*NL*
others
.
A
duel
is
quite
irrational
,
and
no
one
expects
it
of
me
.
My
aim
*NL*
is
simply
to
safeguard
my
reputation
,
which
is
essential
for
the
*NL*
uninterrupted
pursuit
of
my
public
duties
.
''
Official
duties
,
which
had
*NL*
always
been
of
great
consequence
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
eyes
,
seemed
*NL*
of
special
importance
to
his
mind
at
this
moment
.
Considering
and
*NL*
rejecting
the
duel
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
turned
to
divorce
--
another
*NL*
solution
selected
by
several
of
the
husbands
he
remembered
.
Passing
in
*NL*
mental
review
all
the
instances
he
knew
of
divorces
-LRB-
there
were
plenty
*NL*
of
them
in
the
very
highest
society
with
which
he
was
very
familiar
-RRB-
,
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
could
not
find
a
single
example
in
which
the
*NL*
object
of
divorce
was
that
which
he
had
in
view
.
In
all
these
instances
*NL*
the
husband
had
practically
ceded
or
sold
his
unfaithful
wife
,
and
the
*NL*
very
party
which
,
being
in
fault
,
had
not
the
right
to
contract
a
fresh
*NL*
marriage
,
had
formed
counterfeit
,
pseudo-matrimonial
ties
with
a
*NL*
self-styled
husband
.
In
his
own
case
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
that
a
*NL*
legal
divorce
,
that
is
to
say
,
one
in
which
only
the
guilty
wife
would
*NL*
be
repudiated
,
was
impossible
of
attainment
.
He
saw
that
the
complex
*NL*
conditions
of
the
life
they
led
made
the
coarse
proofs
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
guilt
,
required
by
the
law
,
out
of
the
question
;
he
saw
that
a
certain
*NL*
refinement
in
that
life
would
not
admit
of
such
proofs
being
brought
*NL*
forward
,
even
if
he
had
them
,
and
that
to
bring
forward
such
proofs
*NL*
would
damage
him
in
the
public
estimation
more
than
it
would
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
attempt
at
divorce
could
lead
to
nothing
but
a
public
scandal
,
which
*NL*
would
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
his
enemies
for
calumny
and
attacks
on
his
*NL*
high
position
in
society
.
His
chief
object
,
to
define
the
position
with
*NL*
the
least
amount
of
disturbance
possible
,
would
not
be
attained
by
*NL*
divorce
either
.
Moreover
,
in
the
event
of
divorce
,
or
even
of
an
attempt
*NL*
to
obtain
a
divorce
,
it
was
obvious
that
the
wife
broke
off
all
*NL*
relations
with
the
husband
and
threw
in
her
lot
with
the
lover
.
And
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
complete
,
as
he
supposed
,
contempt
and
indifference
he
now
*NL*
felt
for
his
wife
,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
still
had
one
feeling
left
in
regard
to
her
--
a
disinclination
to
see
her
*NL*
free
to
throw
in
her
lot
with
Vronsky
,
so
that
her
crime
would
be
to
her
*NL*
advantage
.
The
mere
notion
of
this
so
exasperated
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
that
directly
it
rose
to
his
mind
he
groaned
with
inward
agony
,
and
got
*NL*
up
and
changed
his
place
in
the
carriage
,
and
for
a
long
while
after
,
he
*NL*
sat
with
scowling
brows
,
wrapping
his
numbed
and
bony
legs
in
the
fleecy
*NL*
rug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apart
from
formal
divorce
,
One
might
still
do
like
Karibanov
,
Paskudin
,
*NL*
and
that
good
fellow
Dram
--
that
is
,
separate
from
one
's
wife
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
thinking
,
when
he
had
regained
his
composure
.
But
this
step
too
*NL*
presented
the
same
drawback
of
public
scandal
as
a
divorce
,
and
what
was
*NL*
more
,
a
separation
,
quite
as
much
as
a
regular
divorce
,
flung
his
wife
*NL*
into
the
arms
of
Vronsky
.
``
No
,
it
's
out
of
the
question
,
out
of
the
*NL*
question
!
''
he
said
again
,
twisting
his
rug
about
him
again
.
``
I
can
not
be
*NL*
unhappy
,
but
neither
she
nor
he
ought
to
be
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
feeling
of
jealousy
,
which
had
tortured
him
during
the
period
of
*NL*
uncertainty
,
had
passed
away
at
the
instant
when
the
tooth
had
been
with
*NL*
agony
extracted
by
his
wife
's
words
.
But
that
feeling
had
been
replaced
*NL*
by
another
,
the
desire
,
not
merely
that
she
should
not
be
triumphant
,
*NL*
but
that
she
should
get
due
punishment
for
her
crime
.
He
did
not
*NL*
acknowledge
this
feeling
,
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
longed
for
*NL*
her
to
suffer
for
having
destroyed
his
peace
of
mind
--
his
honor
.
And
*NL*
going
once
again
over
the
conditions
inseparable
from
a
duel
,
a
divorce
,
*NL*
a
separation
,
and
once
again
rejecting
them
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
felt
*NL*
convinced
that
there
was
only
one
solution
,
--
to
keep
her
with
him
,
*NL*
concealing
what
had
happened
from
the
world
,
and
using
every
measure
in
*NL*
his
power
to
break
off
the
intrigue
,
and
still
more
--
though
this
he
did
*NL*
not
admit
to
himself
--
to
punish
her
.
``
I
must
inform
her
of
my
*NL*
conclusion
,
that
thinking
over
the
terrible
position
in
which
she
has
*NL*
placed
her
family
,
all
other
solutions
will
be
worse
for
both
sides
than
*NL*
an
external
_
status
quo
_
,
and
that
such
I
agree
to
retain
,
on
the
strict
*NL*
condition
of
obedience
on
her
part
to
my
wishes
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
cessation
of
all
intercourse
with
her
lover
.
''
When
this
decision
had
*NL*
been
finally
adopted
,
another
weighty
consideration
occurred
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
in
support
of
it
.
``
By
such
a
course
only
shall
I
be
*NL*
acting
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
religion
,
''
he
told
himself
.
*NL*
``
In
adopting
this
course
,
I
am
not
casting
off
a
guilty
wife
,
but
giving
*NL*
her
a
chance
of
amendment
;
and
,
indeed
,
difficult
as
the
task
will
be
to
*NL*
me
,
I
shall
devote
part
of
my
energies
to
her
reformation
and
*NL*
salvation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
perfectly
aware
that
he
could
not
exert
*NL*
any
moral
influence
over
his
wife
,
that
such
an
attempt
at
reformation
*NL*
could
lead
to
nothing
but
falsity
;
though
in
passing
through
these
*NL*
difficult
moments
he
had
not
once
thought
of
seeking
guidance
in
*NL*
religion
,
yet
now
,
when
his
conclusion
corresponded
,
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
him
,
with
the
requirements
of
religion
,
this
religious
sanction
to
his
*NL*
decision
gave
him
complete
satisfaction
,
and
to
some
extent
restored
his
*NL*
peace
of
mind
.
He
was
pleased
to
think
that
,
even
in
such
an
important
*NL*
crisis
in
life
,
no
one
would
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
not
acted
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
principles
of
that
religion
whose
banner
he
had
*NL*
always
held
aloft
amid
the
general
coolness
and
indifference
.
As
he
*NL*
pondered
over
subsequent
developments
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
*NL*
see
,
indeed
,
why
his
relations
with
his
wife
should
not
remain
*NL*
practically
the
same
as
before
.
No
doubt
,
she
could
never
regain
his
*NL*
esteem
,
but
there
was
not
,
and
there
could
not
be
,
any
sort
of
reason
*NL*
that
his
existence
should
be
troubled
,
and
that
he
should
suffer
because
*NL*
she
was
a
bad
and
faithless
wife
.
``
Yes
,
time
will
pass
;
time
,
which
*NL*
arranges
all
things
,
and
the
old
relations
will
be
reestablished
,
''
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
told
himself
;
``
so

As
he
neared
Petersburg
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
not
only
adhered
entirely
*NL*
to
his
decision
,
but
was
even
composing
in
his
head
the
letter
he
would
*NL*
write
to
his
wife
.
Going
into
the
porter
's
room
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
glanced
at
the
letters
and
papers
brought
from
his
office
,
and
directed
*NL*
that
they
should
be
brought
to
him
in
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horses
can
be
taken
out
and
I
will
see
no
one
,
''
he
said
in
answer
*NL*
to
the
porter
,
with
a
certain
pleasure
,
indicative
of
his
agreeable
*NL*
frame
of
mind
,
emphasizing
the
words
,
``
see
no
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
study
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
walked
up
and
down
twice
,
and
stopped
*NL*
at
an
immense
writing-table
,
on
which
six
candles
had
already
been
*NL*
lighted
by
the
valet
who
had
preceded
him
.
He
cracked
his
knuckles
and
*NL*
sat
down
,
sorting
out
his
writing
appurtenances
.
Putting
his
elbows
on
*NL*
the
table
,
he
bent
his
head
on
one
side
,
thought
a
minute
,
and
began
to
*NL*
write
,
without
pausing
for
a
second
.
He
wrote
without
using
any
form
of
*NL*
address
to
her
,
and
wrote
in
French
,
making
use
of
the
plural
''
_
vous
_
,
''
*NL*
which
has
not
the
same
note
of
coldness
as
the
corresponding
Russian
*NL*
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
our
last
conversation
,
I
notified
you
of
my
intention
to
*NL*
communicate
to
you
my
decision
in
regard
to
the
subject
of
that
*NL*
conversation
.
Having
carefully
considered
everything
,
I
am
*NL*
writing
now
with
the
object
of
fulfilling
that
promise
.
My
*NL*
decision
is
as
follows
.
Whatever
your
conduct
may
have
been
,
I
*NL*
do
not
consider
myself
justified
in
breaking
the
ties
in
which
*NL*
we
are
bound
by
a
Higher
Power
.
The
family
can
not
be
broken
up
*NL*
by
a
whim
,
a
caprice
,
or
even
by
the
sin
of
one
of
the
partners
*NL*
in
the
marriage
,
and
our
life
must
go
on
as
it
has
done
in
the
*NL*
past
.
This
is
essential
for
me
,
for
you
,
and
for
our
son
.
I
am
*NL*
fully
persuaded
that
you
have
repented
and
do
repent
of
what
has
*NL*
called
forth
the
present
letter
,
and
that
you
will
cooperate
*NL*
with
me
in
eradicating
the
cause
of
our
estrangement
,
and
*NL*
forgetting
the
past
.
In
the
contrary
event
,
you
can
conjecture
*NL*
what
awaits
you
and
your
son
.
All
this
I
hope
to
discuss
more
in
*NL*
detail
in
a
personal
interview
.
As
the
season
is
drawing
to
a
*NL*
close
,
I
would
beg
you
to
return
to
Petersburg
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
not
later
than
Tuesday
.
All
necessary
preparations
*NL*
shall
be
made
for
your
arrival
here
.
I
beg
you
to
note
that
I
*NL*
attach
particular
significance
to
compliance
with
this
request
.

``
P.S.
--
I
enclose
the
money
which
may
be
needed
for
your
*NL*
expenses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
the
letter
through
and
felt
pleased
with
it
,
and
especially
that
*NL*
he
had
remembered
to
enclose
money
:
there
was
not
a
harsh
word
,
not
a
*NL*
reproach
in
it
,
nor
was
there
undue
indulgence
.
Most
of
all
,
it
was
a
*NL*
golden
bridge
for
return
.
Folding
the
letter
and
smoothing
it
with
a
*NL*
massive
ivory
knife
,
and
putting
it
in
an
envelope
with
the
money
,
he
*NL*
rang
the
bell
with
the
gratification
it
always
afforded
him
to
use
the
*NL*
well
arranged
appointments
of
his
writing-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
this
to
the
courier
to
be
delivered
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
tomorrow
at
*NL*
the
summer
villa
,
''
he
said
,
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
your
excellency
;
tea
to
be
served
in
the
study
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
ordered
tea
to
be
brought
to
the
study
,
and
*NL*
playing
with
the
massive
paper-knife
,
he
moved
to
his
easy
chair
,
near
*NL*
which
there
had
been
placed
ready
for
him
a
lamp
and
the
French
work
on
*NL*
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
that
he
had
begun
.
Over
the
easy
chair
there
hung
*NL*
in
a
gold
frame
an
oval
portrait
of
Anna
,
a
fine
painting
by
a
*NL*
celebrated
artist
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
glanced
at
it
.
The
unfathomable
*NL*
eyes
gazed
ironically
and
insolently
at
him
.
Insufferably
insolent
and
*NL*
challenging
was
the
effect
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
eyes
of
the
black
*NL*
lace
about
the
head
,
admirably
touched
in
by
the
painter
,
the
black
hair
*NL*
and
handsome
white
hand
with
one
finger
lifted
,
covered
with
rings
.
*NL*
After
looking
at
the
portrait
for
a
minute
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
shuddered
so
that
his
lips
quivered
and
he
uttered
the
sound
``
brrr
,
''
and
*NL*
turned
away
.
He
made
haste
to
sit
down
in
his
easy
chair
and
opened
the
*NL*
book
.
He
tried
to
read
,
but
he
could
not
revive
the
very
vivid
interest
*NL*
he
had
felt
before
in
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
.
He
looked
at
the
book
and
*NL*
thought
of
something
else
.
He
thought
not
of
his
wife
,
but
of
a
*NL*
complication
that
had
arisen
in
his
official
life
,
which
at
the
time
*NL*
constituted
the
chief
interest
of
it
.
He
felt
that
he
had
penetrated
*NL*
more
deeply
than
ever
before
into
this
intricate
affair
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
originated
a
leading
idea
--
he
could
say
it
without
*NL*
self-flattery
--
calculated
to
clear
up
the
whole
business
,
to
strengthen
*NL*
him
in
his
official
career
,
to
discomfit
his
enemies
,
and
thereby
to
be
*NL*
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
the
government
.
Directly
the
servant
had
set
*NL*
the
tea
and
left
the
room
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
got
up
and
went
to
the
*NL*
writing-table
.
Moving
into
the
middle
of
the
table
a
portfolio
of
*NL*
papers
,
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
of
self-satisfaction
,
he
took
*NL*
a
pencil
from
a
rack
and
plunged
into
the
perusal
of
a
complex
report
*NL*
relating
to
the
present
complication
.
The
complication
was
of
this
*NL*
nature
:
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
characteristic
quality
as
a
politician
,
*NL*
that
special
individual
qualification
that
every
rising
functionary
*NL*
possesses
,
the
qualification
that
with
his
unflagging
ambition
,
his
*NL*
reserve
,
his
honesty
,
and
with
his
self-confidence
had
made
his
career
,
*NL*
was
his
contempt
for
red
tape
,
his
cutting
down
of
correspondence
,
his
*NL*
direct
contact
,
wherever
possible
,
with
the
living
fact
,
and
his
*NL*
economy
.
It
happened
that
the
famous
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
June
had
*NL*
set
on
foot
an
inquiry
into
the
irrigation
of
lands
in
the
Zaraisky
*NL*
province
,
which
fell
under
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
department
,
and
was
a
*NL*
glaring
example
of
fruitless
expenditure
and
paper
reforms
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
aware
of
the
truth
of
this
.
The
irrigation
of
these
*NL*
lands
in
the
Zaraisky
province
had
been
initiated
by
the
predecessor
of
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
predecessor
.
And
vast
sums
of
money
had
actually
*NL*
been
spent
and
were
still
being
spent
on
this
business
,
and
utterly
*NL*
unproductively
,
and
the
whole
business
could
obviously
lead
to
nothing
*NL*
whatever
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
perceived
this
at
once
on
entering
*NL*
office
,
and
would
have
liked
to
lay
hands
on
the
Board
of
Irrigation
.
*NL*
But
at
first
,
when
he
did
not
yet
feel
secure
in
his
position
,
he
knew
*NL*
it
would
affect
too
many
interests
,
and
would
be
injudicious
.
Later
on
*NL*
he
had
been
engrossed
in
other
questions
,
and
had
simply
forgotten
the
*NL*
Board
of
Irrigation
.
It
went
of
itself
,
like
all
such
boards
,
by
the
*NL*
mere
force
of
inertia
.
-LRB-
Many
people
gained
their
livelihood
by
the
Board
*NL*
of
Irrigation
,
especially
one
highly
conscientious
and
musical
family
:
*NL*
all
the
daughters
played
on
stringed
instruments
,
and
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
knew
the
family
and
had
stood
godfather
to
one
of
the
*NL*
elder
daughters
.
-RRB-
The
raising
of
this
question
by
a
hostile
department
*NL*
was
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
opinion
a
dishonorable
proceeding
,
seeing
*NL*
that
in
every
department
there
were
things
similar
and
worse
,
which
no
*NL*
one
inquired
into
,
for
well-known
reasons
of
official
etiquette
.
*NL*
However
,
now
that
the
glove
had
been
thrown
down
to
him
,
he
had
boldly
*NL*
picked
it
up
and
demanded
the
appointment
of
a
special
commission
to
*NL*
investigate
and
verify
the
working
of
the
Board
of
Irrigation
of
the
*NL*
lands
in
the
Zaraisky
province
.
But
in
compensation
he
gave
no
quarter
*NL*
to
the
enemy
either
.
He
demanded
the
appointment
of
another
special
*NL*
commission
to
inquire
into
the
question
of
the
Native
Tribes
*NL*
Organization
Committee
.
The
question
of
the
Native
Tribes
had
been
*NL*
brought
up
incidentally
in
the
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
June
,
and
had
*NL*
been
pressed
forward
actively
by
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
as
one
admitting
*NL*
of
no
delay
on
account
of
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
native
tribes
.
*NL*
In
the
commission
this
question
had
been
a
ground
of
contention
between
*NL*
several
departments
.
The
department
hostile
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
proved
that
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
was
exceedingly
*NL*
flourishing
,
that
the
proposed
reconstruction
might
be
the
ruin
of
their
*NL*
prosperity
,
and
that
if
there
were
anything
wrong
,
it
arose
mainly
from
*NL*
the
failure
on
the
part
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
department
to
carry
*NL*
out
the
measures
prescribed
by
law
.
Now
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
intended
*NL*
to
demand
:
First
,
that
a
new
commission
should
be
formed
which
should
be
*NL*
empowered
to
investigate
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
on
the
spot
;
*NL*
secondly
,
if
it
should
appear
that
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
*NL*
actually
was
such
as
it
appeared
to
be
from
the
official
documents
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
committee
,
that
another
new
scientific
commission
*NL*
should
be
appointed
to
investigate
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
*NL*
native
tribes
from

religious
points
of

;
*NL*
thirdly
,
that
evidence
should
be
required
from
the
rival
department
of
*NL*
the
measures
that
had
been
taken
during
the
last
ten
years
by
that
*NL*
department
for
averting
the
disastrous
conditions
in
which
the
native
*NL*
tribes
were
now
placed
;
and
fourthly
and
finally
,
that
that
department
*NL*
explain
why
it
had
,
as
appeared
from
the
evidence
before
the
committee
,
*NL*
from
No.

and
18,038
,
from
December

1863
,
and

,
*NL*
acted
in
direct
contravention
of
the
intent
of
the
law
T.
.
.
Act
18
,
and
*NL*
the
note
to
Act
36
.
A
flash
of
eagerness
suffused
the
face
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
as
he
rapidly
wrote
out
a
synopsis
of
these
ideas
for
his
*NL*
own
benefit
.
Having
filled
a
sheet
of
paper
,
he
got
up
,
rang
,
and
sent
a
*NL*
note
to
the
chief
secretary
of
his
department
to
look
up
certain
*NL*
necessary
facts
for
him
.
Getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room
,
he
*NL*
glanced
again
at
the
portrait
,
frowned
,
and
smiled
contemptuously
.
After
*NL*
reading
a
little
more
of
the
book
on
Egyptian
hieroglyphics
,
and
*NL*
renewing
his
interest
in
it
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
to
bed
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
recollecting
as
he
lay
in
bed
the
incident
with
his
wife
,
*NL*
he
saw
it
now
in
by
no
means
such
a
gloomy
light
.

*NL*
Though
Anna
had
obstinately
and
with
exasperation
contradicted
Vronsky
*NL*
when
he
told
her
their
position
was
impossible
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
*NL*
heart
she
regarded
her
own
position
as
false
and
dishonorable
,
and
she
*NL*
longed
with
her
whole
soul
to
change
it
.
On
the
way
home
from
the
races
*NL*
she
had
told
her
husband
the
truth
in
a
moment
of
excitement
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
agony
she
had
suffered
in
doing
so
,
she
was
glad
of
it
.
*NL*
After
her
husband
had
left
her
,
she
told
herself
that
she
was
glad
,
that
*NL*
now
everything
was
made
clear
,
and
at
least
there
would
be
no
more
lying
*NL*
and
deception
.
It
seemed
to
her
beyond
doubt
that
her
position
was
now
*NL*
made
clear
forever
.
It
might
be
bad
,
this
new
position
,
but
it
would
be
*NL*
clear
;
there
would
be
no
indefiniteness
or
falsehood
about
it
.
The
pain
*NL*
she
had
caused
herself
and
her
husband
in
uttering
those
words
would
be
*NL*
rewarded
now
by
everything
being
made
clear
,
she
thought
.
That
evening
*NL*
she
saw
Vronsky
,
but
she
did
not
tell
him
of
what
had
passed
between
her
*NL*
and
her
husband
,
though
,
to
make
the
position
definite
,
it
was
necessary
*NL*
to
tell
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
woke
up
next
morning
the
first
thing
that
rose
to
her
mind
was
*NL*
what
she
had
said
to
her
husband
,
and
those
words
seemed
to
her
so
awful
*NL*
that
she
could
not
conceive
now
how
she
could
have
brought
herself
to
*NL*
utter
those
strange
,
coarse
words
,
and
could
not
imagine
what
would
come
*NL*
of
it
.
But
the
words
were
spoken
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
gone
*NL*
away
without
saying
anything
.
``
I
saw
Vronsky
and
did
not
tell
him
.
At
*NL*
the
very
instant
he
was
going
away
I
would
have
turned
him
back
and
told
*NL*
him
,
but
I
changed
my
mind
,
because
it
was
strange
that
I
had
not
told
*NL*
him
the
first
minute
.
Why
was
it
I
wanted
to
tell
him
and
did
not
tell
*NL*
him
?
''
And
in
answer
to
this
question
a
burning
blush
of
shame
spread
*NL*
over
her
face
.
She
knew
what
had
kept
her
from
it
,
she
knew
that
she
had
*NL*
been
ashamed
.
Her
position
,
which
had
seemed
to
her
simplified
the
night
*NL*
before
,
suddenly
struck
her
now
as
not
only
not
simple
,
but
as
*NL*
absolutely
hopeless
.
She
felt
terrified
at
the
disgrace
,
of
which
she
*NL*
had
not
ever
thought
before
.
Directly
she
thought
of
what
her
husband
*NL*
would
do
,
the
most
terrible
ideas
came
to
her
mind
.
She
had
a
vision
of
*NL*
being
turned
out
of
the
house
,
of
her
shame
being
proclaimed
to
all
the
*NL*
world
.
She
asked
herself
where
she
should
go
when
she
was
turned
out
of
*NL*
the
house
,
and
she
could
not
find
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
thought
of
Vronsky
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
did
not
love
her
,
*NL*
that
he
was
already
beginning
to
be
tired
of
her
,
that
she
could
not
*NL*
offer
herself
to
him
,
and
she
felt
bitter
against
him
for
it
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
the
words
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband
,
and
had
*NL*
continually
repeated
in
her
imagination
,
she
had
said
to
everyone
,
and
*NL*
everyone
had
heard
them
.
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
look
those
of
*NL*
her
own
household
in
the
face
.
She
could
not
bring
herself
to
call
her
*NL*
maid
,
and
still
less
go
downstairs
and
see
her
son
and
his
governess
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maid
,
who
had
been
listening
at
her
door
for
a
long
while
,
came
into
*NL*
her
room
of
her
own
accord
.
Anna
glanced
inquiringly
into
her
face
,
and
*NL*
blushed
with
a
scared
look
.
The
maid
begged
her
pardon
for
coming
in
,
*NL*
saying
that
she
had
fancied
the
bell
rang
.
She
brought
her
clothes
and
a
*NL*
note
.
The
note
was
from
Betsy
.
Betsy
reminded
her
that
Liza
Merkalova
*NL*
and
Baroness
Shtoltz
were
coming
to
play
croquet
with
her
that
morning
*NL*
with
their
adorers
,
Kaluzhsky
and
old
Stremov
.
``
Come
,
if
only
as
a
study
*NL*
in
morals
.
I
shall
expect
you
,
''
she
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
read
the
note
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
I
need
nothing
,
''
she
said
to
Annushka
,
who
was
rearranging
the
*NL*
bottles
and
brushes
on
the
dressing
table
.
``
You
can
go
.
I
'll
dress
at
*NL*
once
and
come
down
.
I
need
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annushka
went
out
,
but
Anna
did
not
begin
dressing
,
and
sat
in
the
same
*NL*
position
,
her
head
and
hands
hanging
listlessly
,
and
every
now
and
then
*NL*
she
shivered
all
over
,
seemed
as
though
she
would
make
some
gesture
,
*NL*
utter
some
word
,
and
sank
back
into
lifelessness
again
.
She
repeated
*NL*
continually
,
``
My
God
!
my
God
!
''
But
neither
``
God
''
nor
``
my
''
had
any
*NL*
meaning
to
her
.
The
idea
of
seeking
help
in
her
difficulty
in
religion
*NL*
was
as
remote
from
her
as
seeking
help
from
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
himself
,
although
she
had
never
had
doubts
of
the
faith
in
which
she
had
*NL*
been
brought
up
.
She
knew
that
the
support
of
religion
was
possible
only
*NL*
upon
condition
of
renouncing
what
made
up
for
her
the
whole
meaning
of
*NL*
life
.
She
was
not
simply
miserable
,
she
began
to
feel
alarm
at
the
new
*NL*
spiritual
condition
,
never
experienced
before
,
in
which
she
found
*NL*
herself
.
She
felt
as
though
everything
were
beginning
to
be
double
in
*NL*
her
soul
,
just
as
objects
sometimes
appear
double
to
over-tired
eyes
.
*NL*
She
hardly
knew
at
times
what
it
was
she
feared
,
and
what
she
hoped
for
.
*NL*
Whether
she
feared
or
desired
what
had
happened
,
or
what
was
going
to
*NL*
happen
,
and
exactly
what
she
longed
for
,
she
could
not
have
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
am
I
doing
!
''
she
said
to
herself
,
feeling
a
sudden
thrill
of
*NL*
pain
in
both
sides
of
her
head
.
When
she
came
to
herself
,
she
saw
that
*NL*
she
was
holding
her
hair
in
both
hands
,
each
side
of
her
temples
,
and
*NL*
pulling
it
.
She
jumped
up
,
and
began
walking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coffee
is
ready
,
and
mademoiselle
and
Seryozha
are
waiting
,
''
said
*NL*
Annushka
,
coming
back
again
and
finding
Anna
in
the
same
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
?
What
about
Seryozha
?
''
Anna
asked
,
with
sudden
eagerness
,
*NL*
recollecting
her
son
's
existence
for
the
first
time
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
naughty
,
I
think
,
''
answered
Annushka
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
peaches
were
lying
on
the
table
in
the
corner
room
.
I
think
he
*NL*
slipped
in
and
ate
one
of
them
on
the
sly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
recollection
of
her
son
suddenly
roused
Anna
from
the
helpless
*NL*
condition
in
which
she
found
herself
.
She
recalled
the
partly
sincere
,
*NL*
though
greatly
exaggerated
,
role
of
the
mother
living
for
her
child
,
*NL*
which
she
had
taken
up
of
late
years
,
and
she
felt
with
joy
that
in
the
*NL*
plight
in
which
she
found
herself
she
had
a
support
,
quite
apart
from
*NL*
her
relation
to
her
husband
or
to
Vronsky
.
This
support
was
her
son
.
In
*NL*
whatever
position
she
might
be
placed
,
she
could
not
lose
her
son
.
Her
*NL*
husband
might
put
her
to
shame
and
turn
her
out
,
Vronsky
might
grow
cold
*NL*
to
her
and
go
on
living
his
own
life
apart
-LRB-
she
thought
of
him
again
*NL*
with
bitterness
and
reproach
-RRB-
;
she
could
not
leave
her
son
.
She
had
an
*NL*
aim
in
life
.
And
she
must
act
;
act
to
secure
this
relation
to
her
son
,
*NL*
so
that
he
might
not
be
taken
from
her
.
Quickly
indeed
,
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
she
must
take
action
before
he
was
taken
from
her
.
She
must
*NL*
take
her
son
and
go
away
.
Here
was
the
one
thing
she
had
to
do
now
.
She
*NL*
needed
consolation
.
She
must
be
calm
,
and
get
out
of
this
insufferable
*NL*
position
.
The
thought
of
immediate
action
binding
her
to
her
son
,
of
*NL*
going
away
somewhere
with
him
,
gave
her
this
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dressed
quickly
,
went
downstairs
,
and
with
resolute
steps
walked
*NL*
into
the
drawing
room
,
where
she
found
,
as
usual
,
waiting
for
her
,
the
*NL*
coffee
,
Seryozha
,
and
his
governess
.
Seryozha
,
all
in
white
,
with
his
*NL*
back
and
head
bent
,
was
standing
at
a
table
under
a
looking-glass
,
and
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
intense
concentration
which
she
knew
well
,
and
in
*NL*
which
he
resembled
his
father
,
he
was
doing
something
to
the
flowers
he
*NL*
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
governess
had
a
particularly
severe
expression
.
Seryozha
screamed
*NL*
shrilly
,
as
he
often
did
,
``
Ah
,
mamma
!
''
and
stopped
,
hesitating
whether
*NL*
to
go
to
greet
his
mother
and
put
down
the
flowers
,
or
to
finish
making
*NL*
the
wreath
and
go
with
the
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
governess
,
after
saying
good-morning
,
began
a
long
and
detailed
*NL*
account
of
Seryozha
's
naughtiness
,
but
Anna
did
not
hear
her
;
she
was
*NL*
considering
whether
she
would
take
her
with
her
or
not
.
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
*NL*
take
her
,
''
she
decided
.
``
I
'll
go
alone
with
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
very
wrong
,
''
said
Anna
,
and
taking
her
son
by
the
shoulder
*NL*
she
looked
at
him
,
not
severely
,
but
with
a
timid
glance
that
bewildered
*NL*
and
delighted
the
boy
,
and
she
kissed
him
.
``
Leave
him
to
me
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
the
astonished
governess
,
and
not
letting
go
of
her
son
,
she
sat
down
*NL*
at
the
table
,
where
coffee
was
set
ready
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
!
I
...
I
...
did
n't
...
''
he
said
,
trying
to
make
out
from
her
*NL*
expression
what
was
in
store
for
him
in
regard
to
the
peaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
,
''
she
said
,
as
soon
as
the
governess
had
left
the
room
,
``
that
*NL*
was
wrong
,
but
you
'll
never
do
it
again
,
will
you
?
...
You
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
that
the
tears
were
coming
into
her
eyes
.
``
Can
I
help
loving
*NL*
him
?
''
she
said
to
herself
,
looking
deeply
into
his
scared
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
delighted
eyes
.
``
And
can
he
ever
join
his
father
in
punishing
*NL*
me
?
Is
it
possible
he
will
not
feel
for
me
?
''
Tears
were
already
flowing
*NL*
down
her
face
,
and
to
hide
them
she
got
up
abruptly
and
almost
ran
out
*NL*
on
to
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
thunder
showers
of
the
last
few
days
,
cold
,
bright
weather
had
*NL*
set
in
.
The
air
was
cold
in
the
bright
sun
that
filtered
through
the
*NL*
freshly
washed
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shivered
,
both
from
the
cold
and
from
the
inward
horror
which
had
*NL*
clutched
her
with
fresh
force
in
the
open
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
along
,
run
along
to
Mariette
,
''
she
said
to
Seryozha
,
who
had
*NL*
followed
her
out
,
and
she
began
walking
up
and
down
on
the
straw
matting
*NL*
of
the
terrace
.
``
Can
it
be
that
they
wo
n't
forgive
me
,
wo
n't
understand
*NL*
how
it
all
could
n't
be
helped
?
''
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
still
,
and
looking
at
the
tops
of
the
aspen
trees
waving
in
the
*NL*
wind
,
with
their
freshly
washed
,
brightly
shining
leaves
in
the
cold
*NL*
sunshine
,
she
knew
that
they
would
not
forgive
her
,
that
everyone
and
*NL*
everything
would
be
merciless
to
her
now
as
was
that
sky
,
that
green
.
*NL*
And
again
she
felt
that
everything
was
split
in
two
in
her
soul
.
``
I
*NL*
must
n't
,
must
n't
think
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
I
must
get
ready
.
To
go
*NL*
where
?
When
?
Whom
to
take
with
me
?
Yes
,
to
Moscow
by
the
evening
train
.
*NL*
Annushka
and
Seryozha
,
and
only
the
most
necessary
things
.
But
first
I
*NL*
must
write
to
them
both
.
''
She
went
quickly
indoors
into
her
boudoir
,
sat
*NL*
down
at
the
table
,
and
wrote
to
her
husband
:
--
``
After
what
has
happened
,
*NL*
I
can
not
remain
any
longer
in
your
house
.
I
am
going
away
,
and
taking
my
*NL*
son
with
me
.
I
do
n't
know
the
law
,
and
so
I
do
n't
know
with
which
of
the
*NL*
parents
the
son
should
remain
;
but
I
take
him
with
me
because
I
can
not
*NL*
live
without
him
.
Be
generous
,
leave
him
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
point
she
wrote
rapidly
and
naturally
,
but
the
appeal
to
his
*NL*
generosity
,
a
quality
she
did
not
recognize
in
him
,
and
the
necessity
of
*NL*
winding
up
the
letter
with
something
touching
,
pulled
her
up
.
``
Of
my
*NL*
fault
and
my
remorse
I
can
not
speak
,
because
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
again
,
finding
no
connection
in
her
ideas
.
``
No
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
there
's
no
need
of
anything
,
''
and
tearing
up
the
letter
,
she
*NL*
wrote
it
again
,
leaving
out
the
allusion
to
generosity
,
and
sealed
it
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
letter
had
to
be
written
to
Vronsky
.
``
I
have
told
my
husband
,
''
*NL*
she
wrote
,
and
she
sat
a
long
while
unable
to
write
more
.
It
was
so
*NL*
coarse
,
so
unfeminine
.
``
And
what
more
am
I
to
write
to
him
?
''
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
Again
a
flush
of
shame
spread
over
her
face
;
she
recalled
his
*NL*
composure
,
and
a
feeling
of
anger
against
him
impelled
her
to
tear
the
*NL*
sheet
with
the
phrase
she
had
written
into
tiny
bits
.
``
No
need
of
*NL*
anything
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
and
closing
her
blotting-case
she
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
told
the
governess
and
the
servants
that
she
was
going
that
*NL*
day
to
Moscow
,
and
at
once
set
to
work
to
pack
up
her
things
.

*NL*
All
the
rooms
of
the
summer
villa
were
full
of
porters
,
gardeners
,
and
*NL*
footmen
going
to
and
fro
carrying
out
things
.
Cupboards
and
chests
were
*NL*
open
;
twice
they
had
sent
to
the
shop
for
cord
;
pieces
of
newspaper
were
*NL*
tossing
about
on
the
floor
.
Two
trunks
,
some
bags
and
strapped-up
rugs
,
*NL*
had
been
carried
down
into
the
hall
.
The
carriage
and
two
hired
cabs
*NL*
were
waiting
at
the
steps
.
Anna
,
forgetting
her
inward
agitation
in
the
*NL*
work
of
packing
,
was
standing
at
a
table
in
her
boudoir
,
packing
her
*NL*
traveling
bag
,
when
Annushka
called
her
attention
to
the
rattle
of
some
*NL*
carriage
driving
up
.
Anna
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
courier
on
the
steps
,
ringing
at
the
front
door
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
and
find
out
what
it
is
,
''
she
said
,
and
with
a
calm
sense
of
being
*NL*
prepared
for
anything
,
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
,
folding
her
hands
on
*NL*
her
knees
.
A
footman
brought
in
a
thick
packet
directed
in
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

answer
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
she
said
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
room
she
tore
open
*NL*
the
letter
with
trembling
fingers
.
A
roll
of
unfolded
notes
done
up
in
a
*NL*
wrapper
fell
out
of
it
.
She
disengaged
the
letter
and
began
reading
it
*NL*
at
the
end
.
``
Preparations
shall
be
made
for
your
arrival
here
...
I
*NL*
attach
particular
significance
to
compliance
...
''
she
read
.
She
ran
on
,
*NL*
then
back
,
read
it
all
through
,
and
once
more
read
the
letter
all
*NL*
through
again
from
the
beginning
.
When
she
had
finished
,
she
felt
that
*NL*
she
was
cold
all
over
,
and
that
a
fearful
calamity
,
such
as
she
had
not
*NL*
expected
,
had
burst
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
she
had
regretted
that
she
had
spoken
to
her
husband
,
and
*NL*
wished
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
those
words
could
be
unspoken
.
And
*NL*
here
this
letter
regarded
them
as
unspoken
,
and
gave
her
what
she
had
*NL*
wanted
.
But
now
this
letter
seemed
to
her
more
awful
than
anything
she
*NL*
had
been
able
to
conceive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
right
!
''
she
said
;
``
of
course
,
he
's
always
right
;
he
's
a
Christian
,
*NL*
he
's
generous
!
Yes
,
vile
,
base
creature
!
And
no
one
understands
it
*NL*
except
me
,
and
no
one
ever
will
;
and
I
ca
n't
explain
it
.
They
say
he
's
*NL*
so
religious
,
so
high-principled
,
so
upright
,
so
clever
;
but
they
do
n't
*NL*
see
what
I
've
seen
.
They
do
n't
know
how
he
has
crushed
my
life
for
eight
*NL*
years
,
crushed
everything
that
was
living
in
me
--
he
has
not
once
even
*NL*
thought
that
I
'm
a
live
woman
who
must
have
love
.
They
do
n't
know
how
at
*NL*
every
step
he
's
humiliated
me
,
and
been
just
as
pleased
with
himself
.
*NL*
Have
n't
I
striven
,
striven
with
all
my
strength
,
to
find
something
to
*NL*
give
meaning
to
my
life
?
Have
n't
I
struggled
to
love
him
,
to
love
my
son
*NL*
when
I
could
not
love
my
husband
?
But
the
time
came
when
I
knew
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
cheat
myself
any
longer
,
that
I
was
alive
,
that
I
was
not
to
*NL*
blame
,
that
God
has
made
me
so
that
I
must
love
and
live
.
And
now
what
*NL*
does
he
do
?
If
he
'd
killed
me
,
if
he
'd
killed
him
,
I
could
have
borne
*NL*
anything
,
I
could
have
forgiven
anything
;
but
,
no
,
he
...
How
was
it
I
*NL*
did
n't
guess
what
he
would
do
?
He
's
doing
just
what
's
characteristic
of
*NL*
his
mean
character
.
He
'll
keep
himself
in
the
right
,
while
me
,
in
my
*NL*
ruin
,
he
'll
drive
still
lower
to
worse
ruin
yet
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
the
words
from
the
letter
.
``
You
can
conjecture
what
awaits
*NL*
you
and
your
son
...
''
``
That
's
a
threat
to
take
away
my
child
,
and
most
*NL*
likely
by
their
stupid
law
he
can
.
But
I
know
very
well
why
he
says
it
.
*NL*
He
does
n't
believe
even
in
my
love
for
my
child
,
or
he
despises
it
-LRB-
just
*NL*
as
he
always
used
to
ridicule
it
-RRB-
.
He
despises
that
feeling
in
me
,
but
*NL*
he
knows
that
I
wo
n't
abandon
my
child
,
that
I
ca
n't
abandon
my
child
,
*NL*
that
there
could
be
no
life
for
me
without
my
child
,
even
with
him
whom
*NL*
I
love
;
but
that
if
I
abandoned
my
child
and
ran
away
from
him
,
I
should
*NL*
be
acting
like
the
most
infamous
,
basest
of
women
.
He
knows
that
,
and
*NL*
knows
that
I
am
incapable
of
doing
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
another
sentence
in
the
letter
.
``
Our
life
must
go
on
as
it
*NL*
has
done
in
the
past
...
''
``
That
life
was
miserable
enough
in
the
old
*NL*
days
;
it
has
been
awful
of
late
.
What
will
it
be
now
?
And
he
knows
all
*NL*
that
;
he
knows
that
I
ca
n't
repent
that
I
breathe
,
that
I
love
;
he
knows
*NL*
that
it
can
lead
to
nothing
but
lying
and
deceit
;
but
he
wants
to
go
on
*NL*
torturing
me
.
I
know
him
;
I
know
that
he
's
at
home
and
is
happy
in
*NL*
deceit
,
like
a
fish
swimming
in
the
water
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
give
him
that
*NL*
happiness
.
I
'll
break
through
the
spiderweb
of
lies
in
which
he
wants
to
*NL*
catch
me
,
come
what
may
.
Anything
's
better
than
lying
and
deceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
?
My
God
!
my
God
!
Was
ever
a
woman
so
miserable
as
I
am
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
will
break
through
it
,
I
will
break
through
it
!
''
she
cried
,
*NL*
jumping
up
and
keeping
back
her
tears
.
And
she
went
to
the
writing
table
*NL*
to
write
him
another
letter
.
But
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
was
not
strong
enough
to
break
through
anything
,
that
she
was
*NL*
not
strong
enough
to
get
out
of
her
old
position
,
however
false
and
*NL*
dishonorable
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
at
the
writing
table
,
but
instead
of
writing
she
clasped
*NL*
her
hands
on
the
table
,
and
,
laying
her
head
on
them
,
burst
into
tears
,
*NL*
with
sobs
and
heaving
breast
like
a
child
crying
.
She
was
weeping
that
*NL*
her
dream
of
her
position
being
made
clear
and
definite
had
been
*NL*
annihilated
forever
.
She
knew
beforehand
that
everything
would
go
on
in
*NL*
the
old
way
,
and
far
worse
,
indeed
,
than
in
the
old
way
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
the
position
in
the
world
that
she
enjoyed
,
and
that
had
seemed
to
her
*NL*
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
morning
,
that
this
position
was
precious
*NL*
to
her
,
that
she
would
not
have
the
strength
to
exchange
it
for
the
*NL*
shameful
position
of
a
woman
who
has
abandoned
husband
and
child
to
join
*NL*
her
lover
;
that
however
much
she
might
struggle
,
she
could
not
be
*NL*
stronger
than
herself
.
She
would
never
know
freedom
in
love
,
but
would
*NL*
remain
forever
a
guilty
wife
,
with
the
menace
of
detection
hanging
over
*NL*
her
at
every
instant
;
deceiving
her
husband
for
the
sake
of
a
shameful
*NL*
connection
with
a
man
living
apart
and
away
from
her
,
whose
life
she
*NL*
could
never
share
.
She
knew
that
this
was
how
it
would
be
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
it
was
so
awful
that
she
could
not
even
conceive
what
it
would
*NL*
end
in
.
And
she
cried
without
restraint
,
as
children
cry
when
they
are
*NL*
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
footman
's
steps
forced
her
to
rouse
herself
,
and
,
*NL*
hiding
her
face
from
him
,
she
pretended
to
be
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
courier
asks
if
there
's
an
answer
,
''
the
footman
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
answer
?
Yes
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
Let
him
wait
.
I
'll
ring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
write
?
''
she
thought
.
``
What
can
I
decide
upon
alone
?
What
do
*NL*
I
know
?
What
do
I
want
?
What
is
there
I
care
for
?
''
Again
she
felt
that
*NL*
her
soul
was
beginning
to
be
split
in
two
.
She
was
terrified
again
at
*NL*
this
feeling
,
and
clutched
at
the
first
pretext
for
doing
something
*NL*
which
might
divert
her
thoughts
from
herself
.
``
I
ought
to
see
Alexey
''
*NL*
-LRB-
so
she
called
Vronsky
in
her
thoughts
-RRB-
;
``
no
one
but
he
can
tell
me
what
*NL*
I
ought
to
do
.
I
'll
go
to
Betsy
's
,
perhaps
I
shall
see
him
there
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
completely
forgetting
that
when
she
had
told
him
the
*NL*
day
before
that
she
was
not
going
to
Princess
Tverskaya
's
,
he
had
said
*NL*
that
in
that
case
he
should
not
go
either
.
She
went
up
to
the
table
,
*NL*
wrote
to
her
husband
,
``
I
have
received
your
letter
.
--
A.
''
;
and
,
ringing
*NL*
the
bell
,
gave
it
to
the
footman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
going
,
''
she
said
to
Annushka
,
as
she
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
going
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
do
n't
unpack
till
tomorrow
,
and
let
the
carriage
wait
.
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
the
princess
's

Which
dress
am
I
to
get
ready

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
croquet
party
to
which
the
Princess
Tverskaya
had
invited
Anna
was
*NL*
to
consist
of
two
ladies
and
their
adorers
.
These
two
ladies
were
the
*NL*
chief
representatives
of
a
select
new
Petersburg
circle
,
nicknamed
,
in
*NL*
imitation
of
some
imitation
,
_
les
sept
merveilles
du
monde
_
.
These
*NL*
ladies
belonged
to
a
circle
which
,
though
of
the
highest
society
,
was
*NL*
utterly
hostile
to
that
in
which
Anna
moved
.
Moreover
,
Stremov
,
one
of
*NL*
the
most
influential
people
in
Petersburg
,
and
the
elderly
admirer
of
*NL*
Liza
Merkalova
,
was
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
enemy
in
the
political
*NL*
world
.
From
all
these
considerations
Anna
had
not
meant
to
go
,
and
the
*NL*
hints
in
Princess
Tverskaya
's
note
referred
to
her
refusal
.
But
now
Anna
*NL*
was
eager
to
go
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
arrived
at
Princess
Tverskaya
's
earlier
than
the
other
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
as
she
entered
,
Vronsky
's
footman
,
with
side-whiskers
*NL*
combed
out
like
a
_
Kammerjunker
_
,
went
in
too
.
He
stopped
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
off
his
cap
,
let
her
pass
.
Anna
recognized
him
,
and
only
*NL*
then
recalled
that
Vronsky
had
told
her
the
day
before
that
he
would
not
*NL*
come
.
Most
likely
he
was
sending
a
note
to
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
took
off
her
outer
garment
in
the
hall
,
she
heard
the
footman
,
*NL*
pronouncing
his
``
r
's
''
even
like
a
_
Kammerjunker
_
,
say
,
``
From
the
count
*NL*
for
the
princess
,
''
and
hand
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
question
him
as
to
where
his
master
was
.
She
longed
to
*NL*
turn
back
and
send
him
a
letter
to
come
and
see
her
,
or
to
go
herself
to
*NL*
see
him
.
But
neither
the
first
nor
the
second
nor
the
third
course
was
*NL*
possible
.
Already
she
heard
bells
ringing
to
announce
her
arrival
ahead
*NL*
of
her
,
and
Princess
Tverskaya
's
footman
was
standing
at
the
open
door
*NL*
waiting
for
her
to
go
forward
into
the
inner
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
princess
is
in
the
garden
;
they
will
inform
her
immediately
.
Would
*NL*
you
be
pleased
to
walk
into
the
garden
?
''
announced
another
footman
in
*NL*
another
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
of
uncertainty
,
of
indecision
,
was
still
the
same
as
at
*NL*
home
--
worse
,
in
fact
,
since
it
was
impossible
to
take
any
step
,
*NL*
impossible
to
see
Vronsky
,
and
she
had
to
remain
here
among
outsiders
,
*NL*
in
company
so
uncongenial
to
her
present
mood
.
But
she
was
wearing
a
*NL*
dress
that
she
knew
suited
her
.
She
was
not
alone
;
all
around
was
that
*NL*
luxurious
setting
of
idleness
that
she
was
used
to
,
and
she
felt
less
*NL*
wretched
than
at
home
.
She
was
not
forced
to
think
what
she
was
to
do
.
*NL*
Everything
would
be
done
of
itself
.
On
meeting
Betsy
coming
towards
her
*NL*
in
a
white
gown
that
struck
her
by
its
elegance
,
Anna
smiled
at
her
just
*NL*
as
she
always
did
.
Princess
Tverskaya
was
walking
with
Tushkevitch
and
a
*NL*
young
lady
,
a
relation
,
who
,
to
the
great
joy
of
her
parents
in
the
*NL*
provinces
,
was
spending
the
summer
with
the
fashionable
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
probably
something
unusual
about
Anna
,
for
Betsy
noticed
it
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
slept
badly
,
''
answered
Anna
,
looking
intently
at
the
footman
who
came
*NL*
to
meet
them
,
and
,
as
she
supposed
,
brought
Vronsky
's
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
've
come
!
''
said
Betsy
.
``
I
'm
tired
,
and
was
just
*NL*
longing
to
have
some
tea
before
they
come
.
You
might
go
''
--
she
turned
to
*NL*
Tushkevitch
--
``
with
Masha
,
and
try
the
croquet
ground
over
there
where
*NL*
they
've
been
cutting
it
.
We
shall
have
time
to
talk
a
little
over
tea
;
*NL*
we
'll
have
a
cozy
chat
,
eh
?
''
she
said
in
English
to
Anna
,
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
pressing
the
hand
with
which
she
held
a
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
especially
as
I
ca
n't
stay
very
long
with
you
.
I
'm
forced
to
go
on
*NL*
to
old
Madame
Vrede
.
I
've
been
promising
to
go
for
a
century
,
''
said
*NL*
Anna
,
to
whom
lying
,
alien
as
it
was
to
her
nature
,
had
become
not
*NL*
merely
simple
and
natural
in
society
,
but
a
positive
source
of
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Why
she
said
this
,
which
she
had
not
thought
of
a
second
*NL*
before
,
she
could
not
have
explained
.
She
had
said
it
simply
from
the
*NL*
reflection
that
as
Vronsky
would
not
be
here
,
she
had
better
secure
her
*NL*
own
freedom
,
and
try
to
see
him
somehow
.
But
why
she
had
spoken
of
old
*NL*
Madame
Vrede
,
whom
she
had
to
go
and
see
,
as
she
had
to
see
many
other
*NL*
people
,
she
could
not
have
explained
;
and
yet
,
as
it
afterwards
turned
*NL*
out
,
had
she
contrived
the
most
cunning
devices
to
meet
Vronsky
,
she
*NL*
could
have
thought
of
nothing
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
not
going
to
let
you
go
for
anything
,
''
answered
Betsy
,
looking
*NL*
intently
into
Anna
's
face
.
``
Really
,
if
I
were
not
fond
of
you
,
I
should
*NL*
feel
offended
.
One
would
think
you
were
afraid
my
society
would
*NL*
compromise
you
.
Tea
in
the
little
dining
room
,
please
,
''
she
said
,
half
*NL*
closing
her
eyes
,
as
she
always
did
when
addressing
the
footman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
note
from
him
,
she
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
's
playing
us
false
,
''
she
said
in
French
;
``
he
writes
that
he
*NL*
ca
n't
come
,
''
she
added
in
a
tone
as
simple
and
natural
as
though
it
*NL*
could
never
enter
her
head
that
Vronsky
could
mean
anything
more
to
Anna
*NL*
than
a
game
of
croquet
.
Anna
knew
that
Betsy
knew
everything
,
but
,
*NL*
hearing
how
she
spoke
of
Vronsky
before
her
,
she
almost
felt
persuaded
*NL*
for
a
minute
that
she
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Anna
indifferently
,
as
though
not
greatly
interested
in
the
*NL*
matter
,
and
she
went
on
smiling
:
``
How
can
you
or
your
friends
compromise
*NL*
anyone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
playing
with
words
,
this
hiding
of
a
secret
,
had
a
great
*NL*
fascination
for
Anna
,
as
,
indeed
,
it
has
for
all
women
.
And
it
was
not
*NL*
the
necessity
of
concealment
,
not
the
aim
with
which
the
concealment
was
*NL*
contrived
,
but
the
process
of
concealment
itself
which
attracted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
more
Catholic
than
the
Pope
,
''
she
said
.
``
Stremov
and
Liza
*NL*
Merkalova
,
why
,
they
're
the
cream
of
the
cream
of
society
.
Besides
,
*NL*
they
're
received
everywhere
,
and
_
I
_
''
--
she
laid
special
stress
on
the
*NL*
I
--
``
have
never
been
strict
and
intolerant
.
It
's
simply
that
I
have
n't
*NL*
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
do
n't
care
,
perhaps
,
to
meet
Stremov
?
Let
him
and
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
tilt
at
each
other
in
the
committee
--
that
's
no
affair
of
*NL*
ours
.
But
in
the
world
,
he
's
the
most
amiable
man
I
know
,
and
a
devoted
*NL*
croquet
player
.
You
shall
see
.
And
,
in
spite
of
his
absurd
position
as
*NL*
Liza
's
lovesick
swain
at
his
age
,
you
ought
to
see
how
he
carries
off
*NL*
the
absurd
position
.
He
's
very
nice
.
Sappho
Shtoltz
you
do
n't
know
?
Oh
,
*NL*
that
's
a
new
type
,
quite
new
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betsy
said
all
this
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
from
her
good-humored
,
*NL*
shrewd
glance
,
Anna
felt
that
she
partly
guessed
her
plight
,
and
was
*NL*
hatching
something
for
her
benefit
.
They
were
in
the
little
boudoir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
write
to
Alexey
though
,
''
and
Betsy
sat
down
to
the
table
,
*NL*
scribbled
a
few
lines
,
and
put
the
note
in
an
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
telling
him
to
come
to
dinner
.
I
've
one
lady
extra
to
dinner
with
*NL*
me
,
and
no
man
to
take
her
in
.
Look
what
I
've
said
,
will
that
persuade
*NL*
him
?
Excuse
me
,
I
must
leave
you
for
a
minute
.
Would
you
seal
it
up
,
*NL*
please
,
and
send
it
off
?
''
she
said
from
the
door
;
``
I
have
to
give
some
*NL*
directions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
a
moment
's
thought
,
Anna
sat
down
to
the
table
with
Betsy
's
*NL*
letter
,
and
,
without
reading
it
,
wrote
below
:
``
It
's
essential
for
me
to
*NL*
see
you
.
Come
to
the
Vrede
garden
.
I
shall
be
there
at
six
o'clock
.
''
She
*NL*
sealed
it
up
,
and
,
Betsy
coming
back
,
in
her
presence
handed
the
note
to
*NL*
be
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
tea
,
which
was
brought
them
on
a
little
tea-table
in
the
cool
little
*NL*
drawing
room
,
the
cozy
chat
promised
by
Princess
Tverskaya
before
the
*NL*
arrival
of
her
visitors
really
did
come
off
between
the
two
women
.
They
*NL*
criticized
the
people
they
were
expecting
,
and
the
conversation
fell
*NL*
upon
Liza
Merkalova
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
sweet
,
and
I
always
liked
her
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
like
her

She
raves
about
you

Yesterday
she
came
up
to
me
*NL*
after
the
races
and
was
in
despair
at
not
finding
you
.
She
says
you
're
a
*NL*
real
heroine
of
romance
,
and
that
if
she
were
a
man
she
would
do
all
*NL*
sorts
of
mad
things
for
your
sake

Stremov
says
she
does
that
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
tell
me
,
please
,
I
never
could
make
it
out
,
''
said
Anna
,
after
*NL*
being
silent
for
some
time
,
speaking
in
a
tone
that
showed
she
was
not
*NL*
asking
an
idle
question
,
but
that
what
she
was
asking
was
of
more
*NL*
importance
to
her
than
it
should
have
been
;
``
do
tell
me
,
please
,
what
*NL*
are
her
relations
with
Prince
Kaluzhsky
,
Mishka
,
as
he
's
called
?
I
've
*NL*
met
them
so
little
.
What
does
it
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betsy
smiled
with
her
eyes
,
and
looked
intently
at
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
new
manner
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
've
all
adopted
that
manner
.
They
've
*NL*
flung
their
caps
over
the
windmills
.
But
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
*NL*
flinging
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
what
are
her
relations
precisely
with
Kaluzhsky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betsy
broke
into
unexpectedly
mirthful
and
irrepressible
laughter
,
a
*NL*
thing
which
rarely
happened
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
encroaching
on
Princess
Myakaya
's
special
domain
now
.
That
's
the
*NL*
question
of
an
_
enfant
terrible
_
,
''
and
Betsy
obviously
tried
to
restrain
*NL*
herself
,
but
could
not
,
and
went
off
into
peals
of
that
infectious
*NL*
laughter
that
people
laugh
who
do
not
laugh
often
.
``
You
'd
better
ask
*NL*
them
,
''
she
brought
out
,
between
tears
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
laugh
,
''
said
Anna
,
laughing
too
in
spite
of
herself
,
``
but
I
*NL*
never
could
understand
it

I

n't
understand
the
husband

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
husband

Liza
Merkalova

husband
carries
her
shawl

and
is
always
*NL*
ready
to
be
of
use
.
But
anything
more
than
that
in
reality
,
no
one
cares
*NL*
to
inquire
.
You
know
in
decent
society
one
does
n't
talk
or
think
even
of
*NL*
certain
details
of
the
toilet

how
it
is
with
this
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
at
Madame
Rolandak

asked
Anna
,
to
change
the
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so

''
answered
Betsy
,
and
,
without
looking
at
her
friend
,
*NL*
she
began
filling
the
little
transparent
cups
with
fragrant
tea
.
Putting
*NL*
a
cup
before
Anna
,
she
took
out
a
cigarette
,
and
,
fitting
it
into
a
*NL*
silver
holder
,
she
lighted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
this
,
you
see
:
I
'm
in
a
fortunate
position
,
''
she
began
,
quite
*NL*
serious
now
,
as
she
took
up
her
cup
.
``
I
understand
you
,
and
I
understand
*NL*
Liza

Liza
now
is
one
of
those
naive
natures
that
,
like
children
,
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
's
good
and
what
's
bad
.
Anyway
,
she
did
n't
comprehend
it
when
*NL*
she
was
very
young
.
And
now
she
's
aware
that
the
lack
of
comprehension
*NL*
suits
her
.
Now
,
perhaps
,
she
does
n't
know
on
purpose

said
Betsy
,
with
*NL*
a
subtle
smile
.
``
But
,
anyway
,
it
suits
her

The
very

you

may
be
looked
at
tragically

and
turned
into
a
misery

may
be
looked
at
simply

even
humorously

Possibly
you
are
inclined

to
look
at
things
too
tragically

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
should
like
to
know
other

said
*NL*
Anna
,
seriously
and
dreamily
.
``
Am
I
worse

*NL*
''
_

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
the
sound
of
steps
and
a
man
's
voice
,
then
a
woman
's
voice
*NL*
and
laughter
,
and
immediately
thereafter
there
walked
in
the
expected
*NL*
guests
:
Sappho
Shtoltz
,
and
a
young
man
beaming
with
excess
of
health
,
*NL*
the
so-called
Vaska
.
It
was
evident
that
ample
supplies
of
beefsteak
,
*NL*
truffles
,
and
Burgundy
never
failed
to
reach
him
at
the
fitting
hour
.
*NL*
Vaska
bowed
to
the
two
ladies
,
and
glanced
at
them
,
but
only
for
one
*NL*
second
.
He
walked
after
Sappho
into
the
drawing-room
,
and
followed
her
*NL*
about
as
though
he
were
chained
to
her
,
keeping
his
sparkling
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
her
as
though
he
wanted
to
eat
her
.
Sappho
Shtoltz
was
a
blonde
*NL*
beauty
with
black
eyes
.
She
walked
with
smart
little
steps
in
*NL*
high-heeled
shoes
,
and
shook
hands
with
the
ladies
vigorously
like
a
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
never
met
this
new
star
of
fashion
,
and
was
struck
by
her
*NL*
beauty
,
the
exaggerated
extreme
to
which
her
dress
was
carried
,
and
the
*NL*
boldness
of
her
manners
.
On
her
head
there
was
such
a
superstructure
of
*NL*
soft
,
golden
hair
--
her
own
and
false
mixed
--
that
her
head
was
equal
in
*NL*
size
to
the
elegantly
rounded
bust
,
of
which
so
much
was
exposed
in
*NL*
front
.
The
impulsive
abruptness
of
her
movements
was
such
that
at
every
*NL*
step
the
lines
of
her
knees
and
the
upper
part
of
her
legs
were
*NL*
distinctly
marked
under
her
dress
,
and
the
question
involuntarily
rose
*NL*
to
the
mind
where
in
the
undulating
,
piled-up
mountain
of
material
at
*NL*
the
back
the
real
body
of
the
woman
,
so
small
and
slender
,
so
naked
in
*NL*
front
,
and
so
hidden
behind
and
below
,
really
came
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Betsy
made
haste
to
introduce
her
to
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fancy
,
we
all
but
ran
over
two
soldiers
,
''
she
began
telling
them
*NL*
at
once
,
using
her
eyes
,
smiling
and
twitching
away
her
tail
,
which
she
*NL*
flung
back
at
one
stroke
all
on
one
side
.
``
I
drove
here
with
Vaska
...
*NL*
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
you
do
n't
know
each
other
.
''
And
mentioning
his
surname
*NL*
she
introduced
the
young
man
,
and
reddening
a
little
,
broke
into
a
*NL*
ringing
laugh
at
her
mistake
--
that
is
,
at
her
having
called
him
Vaska
to
*NL*
a
stranger
.
Vaska
bowed
once
more
to
Anna
,
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
.
*NL*
He
addressed
Sappho
:
``
You
've
lost
your
bet
.
We
got
here
first
.
Pay
up
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sappho
laughed
still
more
festively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
now
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
I
'll
have
it
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
very
well
.
Oh
,
yes
.
''
She
turned
suddenly
to
Princess
Betsy
:
*NL*
``
I
am
a
nice
person
...
I
positively
forgot
it
...
I
've
brought
you
a
*NL*
visitor
.
And
here
he
comes
.
''
The
unexpected
young
visitor
,
whom
Sappho
*NL*
had
invited
,
and
whom
she
had
forgotten
,
was
,
however
,
a
personage
of
*NL*
such
consequence
that
,
in
spite
of
his
youth
,
both
the
ladies
rose
on
*NL*
his
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
new
admirer
of
Sappho
's
.
He
now
dogged
her
footsteps
,
like
*NL*
Vaska
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Prince
Kaluzhsky
arrived
,
and
Liza
Merkalova
with
Stremov
.
*NL*
Liza
Merkalova
was
a
thin
brunette
,
with
an
Oriental
,
languid
type
of
*NL*
face
,
and
--
as
everyone
used
to
say
--
exquisite
enigmatic
eyes
.
The
tone
*NL*
of
her
dark
dress
-LRB-
Anna
immediately
observed
and
appreciated
the
fact
-RRB-
*NL*
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
her
style
of
beauty
.
Liza
was
as
soft
and
*NL*
enervated
as
Sappho
was
smart
and
abrupt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
Anna
's
taste
Liza
was
far
more
attractive
.
Betsy
had
said
to
Anna
*NL*
that
she
had
adopted
the
pose
of
an
innocent
child
,
but
when
Anna
saw
*NL*
her
,
she
felt
that
this
was
not
the
truth
.
She
really
was
both
innocent
*NL*
and
corrupt
,
but
a
sweet
and
passive
woman
.
It
is
true
that
her
tone
was
*NL*
the
same
as
Sappho
's
;
that
like
Sappho
,
she
had
two
men
,
one
young
and
*NL*
one
old
,
tacked
onto
her
,
and
devouring
her
with
their
eyes
.
But
there
*NL*
was
something
in
her
higher
than
what
surrounded
her
.
There
was
in
her
*NL*
the
glow
of
the
real
diamond
among
glass
imitations
.
This
glow
shone
out
*NL*
in
her
exquisite
,
truly
enigmatic
eyes
.
The
weary
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
passionate
,
glance
of
those
eyes
,
encircled
by
dark
rings
,
impressed
one
*NL*
by
its
perfect
sincerity
.
Everyone
looking
into
those
eyes
fancied
he
*NL*
knew
her
wholly
,
and
knowing
her
,
could
not
but
love
her
.
At
the
sight
*NL*
of
Anna
,
her
whole
face
lighted
up
at
once
with
a
smile
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
''
she
said
,
going
up
to
her
.
``
Yesterday
at
*NL*
the
races
all
I
wanted
was
to
get
to
you
,
but
you
'd
gone
away
.
I
did
so
*NL*
want
to
see
you
,
yesterday
especially
.
Was
n't
it
awful
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
looking
at
Anna
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
lay
bare
all
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
had
no
idea
it
would
be
so
thrilling
,
''
said
Anna
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
got
up
at
this
moment
to
go
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
,
''
said
Liza
,
smiling
and
settling
herself
close
to
Anna
.
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
go
either
,
will
you
?
Who
wants
to
play
croquet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
it
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
how
do
you
manage
never
to
be
bored
by
things
?
It
's
delightful
*NL*
to
look
at
you
.
You
're
alive
,
but
I
'm
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
bored
?
Why
,
you
live
in
the
liveliest
set
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
the
people
who
are
not
of
our
set
are
even
more
bored
;
but
*NL*
we
--
I
certainly
--
are
not
happy
,
but
awfully
,
awfully
bored
.

*NL*
*NL*
Sappho
smoking
a
cigarette
went
off
into
the
garden
with
the
two
young
*NL*
men
.
Betsy
and
Stremov
remained
at
the
tea-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
bored
!
''
said
Betsy
.
``
Sappho
says
they
did
enjoy
themselves

tremendously
at

last

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
dreary
it
all
was
!
''
said
Liza
Merkalova
.
``
We
all
drove
back
to
*NL*
my
place
after
the
races
.
And
always
the
same
people
,
always
the
same
.
*NL*
Always
the
same
thing
.
We
lounged
about
on
sofas
all
the
evening
.
What
*NL*
is
there
to
enjoy
in
that
?
No
;
do
tell
me
how
you
manage
never
to
be
*NL*
bored
?
''
she
said
,
addressing
Anna
again
.
``
One
has
but
to
look
at
you
and
*NL*
one
sees
,
here
's
a
woman
who
may
be
happy
or
unhappy
,
but
is
n't
bored
.
*NL*
Tell
me
how
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
nothing
,
''
answered
Anna
,
blushing
at
these
searching
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
best
way
,
''
Stremov
put
in
.
Stremov
was
a
man
of
fifty
,
*NL*
partly
gray
,
but
still
vigorous-looking
,
very
ugly
,
but
with
a
*NL*
characteristic
and
intelligent
face
.
Liza
Merkalova
was
his
wife
's
*NL*
niece
,
and
he
spent
all
his
leisure
hours
with
her
.
On
meeting
Anna
*NL*
Karenina
,
as
he
was
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
enemy
in
the
government
,
he
*NL*
tried
,
like
a
shrewd
man
and
a
man
of
the
world
,
to
be
particularly
*NL*
cordial
with
her
,
the
wife
of
his
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Nothing
,
'
''
he
put
in
with
a
subtle
smile
,
``
that
's
the
very
best
way
.
I
*NL*
told
you
long
ago
,
''
he
said
,
turning
to
Liza
Merkalova
,
``
that
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
be
bored
,
you
must
n't
think
you
're
going
to
be
bored
.
It
's
*NL*
just
as
you
must
n't
be
afraid
of
not
being
able
to
fall
asleep
,
if
*NL*
you
're
afraid
of
sleeplessness
.
That
's
just
what
Anna
Arkadyevna
has
*NL*
just
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
glad
if
I
had
said
it
,
for
it
's
not

clever

true

said
Anna
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

do
tell
me
why
it
is

n't
go

*NL*
being
bored

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sleep
well
one
ought
to
work

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
incorrigible
,
''
said
Stremov
,
not
looking
at
her
,
and
he
spoke
*NL*
again
to
Anna
.
As
he
rarely
met
Anna
,
he
could
say
nothing
but
*NL*
commonplaces
to
her
,
but
he
said
those
commonplaces
as
to
when
she
was
*NL*
returning
to
Petersburg
,
and
how
fond
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
of
*NL*
her
,
with
an
expression
which
suggested
that
he
longed
with
his
whole
*NL*
soul
to
please
her
and
show
his
regard
for
her
and
even
more
than
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tushkevitch
came
in
,
announcing
that
the
party
were
awaiting
the
other
*NL*
players
to
begin
croquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
n't
go
away
,
please
do
n't
,
''
pleaded
Liza
Merkalova
,
hearing
that
*NL*
Anna
was
going
.
Stremov
joined
in
her
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
violent
a
transition
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
go
from
such
company
to
*NL*
old
Madame
Vrede
.
And
besides
,
you
will
only
give
her
a
chance
for
*NL*
talking
scandal
,
while
here
you
arouse
none
but
such
different
feelings
*NL*
of
the
highest
and
most
opposite
kind
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
pondered
for
an
instant
in
uncertainty
.
This
shrewd
man
's
*NL*
flattering
words
,
the
naive
,
childlike
affection
shown
her
by
Liza
*NL*
Merkalova
,
and
all
the
social
atmosphere
she
was
used
to
,
--
it
was
all
so
*NL*
easy
,
and
what
was
in
store
for
her
was
so
difficult
,
that
she
was
for
a
*NL*
minute
in
uncertainty
whether
to
remain
,
whether
to
put
off
a
little
*NL*
longer
the
painful
moment
of
explanation
.
But
remembering
what
was
in
*NL*
store
for
her
alone
at
home
,
if
she
did
not
come
to
some
decision
,
*NL*
remembering
that
gesture
--
terrible
even
in
memory
--
when
she
had
clutched
*NL*
her
hair
in
both
hands
--
she
said
good-bye
and
went
away
.

Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
Vronsky
's
apparently
frivolous
life
in
society
,
he
was
a
man
*NL*
who
hated
irregularity
.
In
early
youth
in
the
Corps
of
Pages
,
he
had
*NL*
experienced
the
humiliation
of
a
refusal
,
when
he
had
tried
,
being
in
*NL*
difficulties
,
to
borrow
money
,
and
since
then
he
had
never
once
put
*NL*
himself
in
the
same
position
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
keep
his
affairs
in
some
sort
of
order
,
he
used
about
five
*NL*
times
a
year
-LRB-
more
or
less
frequently
,
according
to
circumstances
-RRB-
to
*NL*
shut
himself
up
alone
and
put
all
his
affairs
into
definite
shape
.
This
*NL*
he
used
to
call
his
day
of
reckoning
or
_
faire
la
lessive
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
waking
up
the
day
after
the
races
,
Vronsky
put
on
a
white
linen
coat
,
*NL*
and
without
shaving
or
taking
his
bath
,
he
distributed
about
the
table
*NL*
moneys
,
bills
,
and
letters
,
and
set
to
work
.
Petritsky
,
who
knew
he
was
*NL*
ill-tempered
on
such
occasions
,
on
waking
up
and
seeing
his
comrade
at
*NL*
the
writing-table
,
quietly
dressed
and
went
out
without
getting
in
his
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
man
who
knows
to
the
minutest
details
all
the
complexity
of
the
*NL*
conditions
surrounding
him
,
can
not
help
imagining
that
the
complexity
of
*NL*
these
conditions
,
and
the
difficulty
of
making
them
clear
,
is
something
*NL*
exceptional
and
personal
,
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
never
supposes
that
*NL*
others
are
surrounded
by
just
as
complicated
an
array
of
personal
*NL*
affairs
as
he
is
.
So
indeed
it
seemed
to
Vronsky
.
And
not
without
inward
*NL*
pride
,
and
not
without
reason
,
he
thought
that
any
other
man
would
long
*NL*
ago
have
been
in
difficulties
,
would
have
been
forced
to
some
*NL*
dishonorable
course
,
if
he
had
found
himself
in
such
a
difficult
*NL*
position
.
But
Vronsky
felt
that
now
especially
it
was
essential
for
him
*NL*
to
clear
up
and
define
his
position
if
he
were
to
avoid
getting
into
*NL*
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Vronsky
attacked
first
as
being
the
easiest
was
his
pecuniary
*NL*
position
.
Writing
out
on
note
paper
in
his
minute
hand
all
that
he
owed
,
*NL*
he
added
up
the
amount
and
found
that
his
debts
amounted
to
seventeen
*NL*
thousand
and
some
odd
hundreds
,
which
he
left
out
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
clearness
.
Reckoning
up
his
money
and
his
bank
book
,
he
found
that
he
*NL*
had
left
one
thousand
eight
hundred
roubles
,
and
nothing
coming
in
*NL*
before
the
New
Year
.
Reckoning
over
again
his
list
of
debts
,
Vronsky
*NL*
copied
it
,
dividing
it
into
three
classes
.
In
the
first
class
he
put
the
*NL*
debts
which
he
would
have
to
pay
at
once
,
or
for
which
he
must
in
any
*NL*
case
have
the
money
ready
so
that
on
demand
for
payment
there
could
not
*NL*
be
a
moment
's
delay
in
paying
.
Such
debts
amounted
to
about
four
*NL*
thousand
:
one
thousand
five
hundred
for
a
horse
,
and
two
thousand
five
*NL*
hundred
as
surety
for
a
young
comrade
,
Venovsky
,
who
had
lost
that
sum
*NL*
to
a
cardsharper
in
Vronsky
's
presence
.
Vronsky
had
wanted
to
pay
the
*NL*
money
at
the
time
-LRB-
he
had
that
amount
then
-RRB-
,
but
Venovsky
and
Yashvin
*NL*
had
insisted
that
they
would
pay
and
not
Vronsky
,
who
had
not
played
.
*NL*
That
was
so
far
well
,
but
Vronsky
knew
that
in
this
dirty
business
,
*NL*
though
his
only
share
in
it
was
undertaking
by
word
of
mouth
to
be
*NL*
surety
for
Venovsky
,
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
have
the
two
*NL*
thousand
five
hundred
roubles
so
as
to
be
able
to
fling
it
at
the
*NL*
swindler
,
and
have
no
more
words
with
him
.
And
so
for
this
first
and
*NL*
most
important
division
he
must
have
four
thousand
roubles
.
The
second
*NL*
class
--
eight
thousand
roubles
--
consisted
of
less
important
debts
.
These
*NL*
were
principally
accounts
owing
in
connection
with
his
race
horses
,
to
*NL*
the
purveyor
of
oats
and
hay
,
the
English
saddler
,
and
so
on
.
He
would
*NL*
have
to
pay
some
two
thousand
roubles
on
these
debts
too
,
in
order
to
be
*NL*
quite
free
from
anxiety
.
The
last
class
of
debts
--
to
shops
,
to
hotels
,
*NL*
to
his
tailor
--
were
such
as
need
not
be
considered
.
So
that
he
needed
at
*NL*
least
six
thousand
roubles
for
current
expenses
,
and
he
only
had
one
*NL*
thousand
eight
hundred
.
For
a
man
with
one
hundred
thousand
roubles
of
*NL*
revenue
,
which
was
what
everyone
fixed
as
Vronsky
's
income
,
such
debts
,
*NL*
one
would
suppose
,
could
hardly
be
embarrassing
;
but
the
fact
was
that
*NL*
he
was
far
from
having
one
hundred
thousand
.
His
father
's
immense
*NL*
property
,
which
alone
yielded
a
yearly
income
of
two
hundred
thousand
,
*NL*
was
left
undivided
between
the
brothers
.
At
the
time
when
the
elder
*NL*
brother
,
with
a
mass
of
debts
,
married
Princess
Varya
Tchirkova
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
Decembrist
without
any
fortune
whatever
,
Alexey
had
given
*NL*
up
to
his
elder
brother
almost
the
whole
income
from
his
father
's
*NL*
estate
,
reserving
for
himself
only
twenty-five
thousand
a
year
from
it
.
*NL*
Alexey
had
said
at
the
time
to
his
brother
that
that
sum
would
be
*NL*
sufficient
for
him
until
he
married
,
which
he
probably
never
would
do
.
*NL*
And
his
brother
,
who
was
in
command
of
one
of
the
most
expensive
*NL*
regiments
,
and
was
only
just
married
,
could
not
decline
the
gift
.
His
*NL*
mother
,
who
had
her
own
separate
property
,
had
allowed
Alexey
every
year
*NL*
twenty
thousand
in
addition
to
the
twenty-five
thousand
he
had
reserved
,
*NL*
and
Alexey
had
spent
it
all
.
Of
late
his
mother
,
incensed
with
him
on
*NL*
account
of
his
love
affair
and
his
leaving
Moscow
,
had
given
up
sending
*NL*
him
the
money
.
And
in
consequence
of
this
,
Vronsky
,
who
had
been
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
living
on
the
scale
of
forty-five
thousand
a
year
,
having
only
*NL*
received
twenty
thousand
that
year
,
found
himself
now
in
difficulties
.
*NL*
To
get
out
of
these
difficulties
,
he
could
not
apply
to
his
mother
for
*NL*
money
.
Her
last
letter
,
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
,
had
*NL*
particularly
exasperated
him
by
the
hints
in
it
that
she
was
quite
ready
*NL*
to
help
him
to
succeed
in
the
world
and
in
the
army
,
but
not
to
lead
a
*NL*
life
which
was
a
scandal
to
all
good
society
.
His
mother
's
attempt
to
*NL*
buy
him
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
made
him
feel
colder
than
ever
to
*NL*
her
.
But
he
could
not
draw
back
from
the
generous
word
when
it
was
once
*NL*
uttered
,
even
though
he
felt
now
,
vaguely
foreseeing
certain
*NL*
eventualities
in
his
intrigue
with
Madame
Karenina
,
that
this
generous
*NL*
word
had
been
spoken
thoughtlessly
,
and
that
even
though
he
were
not
*NL*
married
he
might
need
all
the
hundred
thousand
of
income
.
But
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
draw
back
.
He
had
only
to
recall
his
brother
's
wife
,
to
*NL*
remember
how
that
sweet
,
delightful
Varya
sought
,
at
every
convenient
*NL*
opportunity
,
to
remind
him
that
she
remembered
his
generosity
and
*NL*
appreciated
it
,
to
grasp
the
impossibility
of
taking
back
his
gift
.
It
*NL*
was
as
impossible
as
beating
a
woman
,
stealing
,
or
lying
.
One
thing
only
*NL*
could
and
ought
to
be
done
,
and
Vronsky
determined
upon
it
without
an
*NL*
instant
's
hesitation
:
to
borrow
money
from
a
money-lender
,
ten
thousand
*NL*
roubles
,
a
proceeding
which
presented
no
difficulty
,
to
cut
down
his
*NL*
expenses
generally
,
and
to
sell
his
race
horses
.
Resolving
on
this
,
he
*NL*
promptly
wrote
a
note
to
Rolandak
,
who
had
more
than
once
sent
to
him
*NL*
with
offers
to
buy
horses
from
him
.
Then
he
sent
for
the
Englishman
and
*NL*
the
money-lender
,
and
divided
what
money
he
had
according
to
the
*NL*
accounts
he
intended
to
pay
.
Having
finished
this
business
,
he
wrote
a
*NL*
cold
and
cutting
answer
to
his
mother
.
Then
he
took
out
of
his
notebook
*NL*
three
notes
of
Anna
's
,
read
them
again
,
burned
them
,
and
remembering
*NL*
their
conversation
on
the
previous
day
,
he
sank
into
meditation
.

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
life
was
particularly
happy
in
that
he
had
a
code
of
*NL*
principles
,
which
defined
with
unfailing
certitude
what
he
ought
and
*NL*
what
he
ought
not
to
do
.
This
code
of
principles
covered
only
a
very
*NL*
small
circle
of
contingencies
,
but
then
the
principles
were
never
*NL*
doubtful
,
and
Vronsky
,
as
he
never
went
outside
that
circle
,
had
never
*NL*
had
a
moment
's
hesitation
about
doing
what
he
ought
to
do
.
These
*NL*
principles
laid
down
as
invariable
rules
:
that
one
must
pay
a
*NL*
cardsharper
,
but
need
not
pay
a
tailor
;
that
one
must
never
tell
a
lie
*NL*
to
a
man
,
but
one
may
to
a
woman
;
that
one
must
never
cheat
anyone
,
but
*NL*
one
may
a
husband
;
that
one
must
never
pardon
an
insult
,
but
one
may
*NL*
give
one
and
so
on
.
These
principles
were
possibly
not
reasonable
and
*NL*
not
good
,
but
they
were
of
unfailing
certainty
,
and
so
long
as
he
*NL*
adhered
to
them
,
Vronsky
felt
that
his
heart
was
at
peace
and
he
could
*NL*
hold
his
head
up
.
Only
quite
lately
in
regard
to
his
relations
with
*NL*
Anna
,
Vronsky
had
begun
to
feel
that
his
code
of
principles
did
not
*NL*
fully
cover
all
possible
contingencies
,
and
to
foresee
in
the
future
*NL*
difficulties
and
perplexities
for
which
he
could
find
no
guiding
clue
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
present
relation
to
Anna
and
to
her
husband
was
to
his
mind
clear
*NL*
and
simple
.
It
was
clearly
and
precisely
defined
in
the
code
of
*NL*
principles
by
which
he
was
guided
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
an
honorable
woman
who
had
bestowed
her
love
upon
him
,
and
he
*NL*
loved
her
,
and
therefore
she
was
in
his
eyes
a
woman
who
had
a
right
to
*NL*
the
same
,
or
even
more
,
respect
than
a
lawful
wife
.
He
would
have
had
*NL*
his
hand
chopped
off
before
he
would
have
allowed
himself
by
a
word
,
by
*NL*
a
hint
,
to
humiliate
her
,
or
even
to
fall
short
of
the
fullest
respect
a
*NL*
woman
could
look
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
attitude
to
society
,
too
,
was
clear
.
Everyone
might
know
,
might
*NL*
suspect
it
,
but
no
one
might
dare
to
speak
of
it
.
If
any
did
so
,
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
force
all
who
might
speak
to
be
silent
and
to
respect
the
*NL*
non-existent
honor
of
the
woman
he
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
attitude
to
the
husband
was
the
clearest
of
all
.
From
the
moment
*NL*
that
Anna
loved
Vronsky
,
he
had
regarded
his
own
right
over
her
as
the
*NL*
one
thing
unassailable
.
Her
husband
was
simply
a
superfluous
and
*NL*
tiresome
person
.
No
doubt
he
was
in
a
pitiable
position
,
but
how
could
*NL*
that
be
helped
?
The
one
thing
the
husband
had
a
right
to
was
to
demand
*NL*
satisfaction
with
a
weapon
in
his
hand
,
and
Vronsky
was
prepared
for
*NL*
this
at
any
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
late
new
inner
relations
had
arisen
between
him
and
her
,
which
*NL*
frightened
Vronsky
by
their
indefiniteness
.
Only
the
day
before
she
had
*NL*
told
him
that
she
was
with
child
.
And
he
felt
that
this
fact
and
what
*NL*
she
expected
of
him
called
for
something
not
fully
defined
in
that
code
*NL*
of
principles
by
which
he
had
hitherto
steered
his
course
in
life
.
And
*NL*
he
had
been
indeed
caught
unawares
,
and
at
the
first
moment
when
she
*NL*
spoke
to
him
of
her
position
,
his
heart
had
prompted
him
to
beg
her
to
*NL*
leave
her
husband
.
He
had
said
that
,
but
now
thinking
things
over
he
saw
*NL*
clearly
that
it
would
be
better
to
manage
to
avoid
that
;
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
as
he
told
himself
so
,
he
was
afraid
whether
it
was
not
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
told
her
to
leave
her
husband
,
that
must
mean
uniting
her
life
*NL*
with
mine
;
am
I
prepared
for
that
?
How
can
I
take
her
away
now
,
when
I
*NL*
have
no
money
?
Supposing
I
could
arrange
...
But
how
can
I
take
her
away
*NL*
while
I
'm
in
the
service
?
If
I
say
that
--
I
ought
to
be
prepared
to
do
*NL*
it
,
that
is
,
I
ought
to
have
the
money
and
to
retire
from
the
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
grew
thoughtful
.
The
question
whether
to
retire
from
the
service
*NL*
or
not
brought
him
to
the
other
and
perhaps
the
chief
though
hidden
*NL*
interest
of
his
life
,
of
which
none
knew
but
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ambition
was
the
old
dream
of
his
youth
and
childhood
,
a
dream
which
he
*NL*
did
not
confess
even
to
himself
,
though
it
was
so
strong
that
now
this
*NL*
passion
was
even
doing
battle
with
his
love
.
His
first
steps
in
the
*NL*
world
and
in
the
service
had
been
successful
,
but
two
years
before
he
*NL*
had
made
a
great
mistake
.
Anxious
to
show
his
independence
and
to
*NL*
advance
,
he
had
refused
a
post
that
had
been
offered
him
,
hoping
that
*NL*
this
refusal
would
heighten
his
value
;
but
it
turned
out
that
he
had
*NL*
been
too
bold
,
and
he
was
passed
over
.
And
having
,
whether
he
liked
or
*NL*
not
,
taken
up
for
himself
the
position
of
an
independent
man
,
he
carried
*NL*
it
off
with
great
tact
and
good
sense
,
behaving
as
though
he
bore
no
*NL*
grudge
against
anyone
,
did
not
regard
himself
as
injured
in
any
way
,
and
*NL*
cared
for
nothing
but
to
be
left
alone
since
he
was
enjoying
himself
.
In
*NL*
reality
he
had
ceased
to
enjoy
himself
as
long
ago
as
the
year
before
,
*NL*
when
he
went
away
to
Moscow
.
He
felt
that
this
independent
attitude
of
a
*NL*
man
who
might
have
done
anything
,
but
cared
to
do
nothing
,
was
already
*NL*
beginning
to
pall
,
that
many
people
were
beginning
to
fancy
that
he
was
*NL*
not
really
capable
of
anything
but
being
a
straightforward
,
good-natured
*NL*
fellow
.
His
connection
with
Madame
Karenina
,
by
creating
so
much
*NL*
sensation
and
attracting
general
attention
,
had
given
him
a
fresh
*NL*
distinction
which
soothed
his
gnawing
worm
of
ambition
for
a
while
,
but
*NL*
a
week
before
that
worm
had
been
roused
up
again
with
fresh
force
.
The
*NL*
friend
of
his
childhood
,
a
man
of
the
same
set
,
of
the
same
coterie
,
his
*NL*
comrade
in
the
Corps
of
Pages
,
Serpuhovskoy
,
who
had
left
school
with
*NL*
him
and
had
been
his
rival
in
class
,
in
gymnastics
,
in
their
scrapes
and
*NL*
their
dreams
of
glory
,
had
come
back
a
few
days
before
from
Central
*NL*
Asia
,
where
he
had
gained
two
steps
up
in
rank
,
and
an
order
rarely
*NL*
bestowed
upon
generals
so
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
arrived
in
Petersburg
,
people
began
to
talk
about
him
as
a
*NL*
newly
risen
star
of
the
first
magnitude
.
A
schoolfellow
of
Vronsky
's
and
*NL*
of
the
same
age
,
he
was
a
general
and
was
expecting
a
command
,
which
*NL*
might
have
influence
on
the
course
of
political
events
;
while
Vronsky
,
*NL*
independent
and
brilliant
and
beloved
by
a
charming
woman
though
he
was
,
*NL*
was
simply
a
cavalry
captain
who
was
readily
allowed
to
be
as
*NL*
independent
as
ever
he
liked
.
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
envy
Serpuhovskoy
and
*NL*
never
could
envy
him
;
but
his
advancement
shows
me
that
one
has
only
to
*NL*
watch
one
's
opportunity
,
and
the
career
of
a
man
like
me
may
be
very
*NL*
rapidly
made
.
Three
years
ago
he
was
in
just
the
same
position
as
I
am
.
*NL*
If
I
retire
,
I
burn
my
ships
.
If
I
remain
in
the
army
,
I
lose
nothing
.
*NL*
She
said
herself
she
did
not
wish
to
change
her
position
.
And
with
her
*NL*
love
I
can
not
feel
envious
of
Serpuhovskoy
.
''
And
slowly
twirling
his
*NL*
mustaches
,
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
walked
about
the
room
.
His
eyes
*NL*
shone
particularly
brightly
,
and
he
felt
in
that
confident
,
calm
,
and
*NL*
happy
frame
of
mind
which
always
came
after
he
had
thoroughly
faced
his
*NL*
position
.
Everything
was
straight
and
clear
,
just
as
after
former
days
*NL*
of
reckoning
.
He
shaved
,
took
a
cold
bath
,
dressed
and
went
out
.

``

Petritsky
.
``
Well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

''
answered
Vronsky
,
smiling
with
his
eyes
only
,
and
twirling
*NL*
the
tips
of
his
mustaches
as
circumspectly
as
though
after
the
perfect
*NL*
order
into
which
his
affairs
had
been
brought
any
over-bold
or
rapid
*NL*
movement
might
disturb
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
always
just
as
if
you
'd
come
out
of
a
bath
after
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Petritsky
.
``
I
've
come
from

''
-LRB-
that
was
what
they
called
the
*NL*
colonel
-RRB-
;
``
they
're
expecting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
without
answering
,
looked
at
his
comrade
,
thinking
of
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
is
that
music
at
his
place
?
''
he
said
,
listening
to
the
familiar
*NL*
sounds
of
polkas
and
waltzes
floating
across
to
him
.
``
What
's
the
fete
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serpuhovskoy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aha

''
said
Vronsky
,
``
why
,
I
did
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smile
in
his
eyes
gleamed
more
brightly
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
once
made
up
his
mind
that
he
was
happy
in
his
love
,
that
he
*NL*
sacrificed
his
ambition
to
it
--
having
anyway
taken
up
this
position
,
*NL*
Vronsky
was
incapable
of
feeling
either
envious
of
Serpuhovskoy
or
hurt
*NL*
with
him
for
not
coming
first
to
him
when
he
came
to
the
regiment
.
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
was
a
good
friend
,
and
he
was
delighted
he
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
very
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
,
Demin
,
had
taken
a
large
country
house
.
The
whole
party
*NL*
were
in
the
wide
lower
balcony
.
In
the
courtyard
the
first
objects
that
*NL*
met
Vronsky
's
eyes
were
a
band
of
singers
in
white
linen
coats
,
standing
*NL*
near
a
barrel
of
vodka
,
and
the
robust
,
good-humored
figure
of
the
*NL*
colonel
surrounded
by
officers
.
He
had
gone
out
as
far
as
the
first
step
*NL*
of
the
balcony
and
was
loudly
shouting
across
the
band
that
played
*NL*
Offenbach
's
quadrille
,
waving
his
arms
and
giving
some
orders
to
a
few
*NL*
soldiers
standing
on
one
side
.
A
group
of
soldiers
,
a
quartermaster
,
and
*NL*
several
subalterns
came
up
to
the
balcony
with
Vronsky
.
The
colonel
*NL*
returned
to
the
table
,
went
out
again
onto
the
steps
with
a
tumbler
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
proposed
the
toast
,
``
To
the
health
of
our
former
comrade
,
*NL*
the
gallant
general
,
Prince
Serpuhovskoy
.
Hurrah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
was
followed
by
Serpuhovskoy
,
who
came
out
onto
the
steps
*NL*
smiling
,
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
get
younger
,
Bondarenko
,
''
he
said
to
the
rosy-checked
,
*NL*
smart-looking
quartermaster
standing
just
before
him
,
still
youngish
*NL*
looking
though
doing
his
second
term
of
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
three
years
since
Vronsky
had
seen
Serpuhovskoy
.
He
looked
more
*NL*
robust
,
had
let
his
whiskers
grow
,
but
was
still
the
same
graceful
*NL*
creature
,
whose
face
and
figure
were
even
more
striking
from
their
*NL*
softness
and
nobility
than
their
beauty
.
The
only
change
Vronsky
*NL*
detected
in
him
was
that
subdued
,
continual
radiance
of
beaming
content
*NL*
which
settles
on
the
faces
of
men
who
are
successful
and
are
sure
of
the
*NL*
recognition
of
their
success
by
everyone
.
Vronsky
knew
that
radiant
air
,
*NL*
and
immediately
observed
it
in
Serpuhovskoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Serpuhovskoy
came
down
the
steps
he
saw
Vronsky
.
A
smile
of
pleasure
*NL*
lighted
up
his
face
.
He
tossed
his
head
upwards
and
waved
the
glass
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
greeting
Vronsky
,
and
showing
him
by
the
gesture
that
he
could
*NL*
not
come
to
him
before
the
quartermaster
,
who
stood
craning
forward
his
*NL*
lips
ready
to
be
kissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
!
''
shouted
the
colonel
.
``
Yashvin
told
me
you
were
in
one
of
*NL*
your
gloomy
tempers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
kissed
the
moist
,
fresh
lips
of
the
gallant-looking
*NL*
quartermaster
,
and
wiping
his
mouth
with
his
handkerchief
,
went
up
to
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
!
''
he
said
,
squeezing
his
hand
and
drawing
him
on
one
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
after
him
,
''
the
colonel
shouted
to
Yashvin
,
pointing
to
*NL*
Vronsky
;
and
he
went
down
below
to
the
soldiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
were
n't
you
at
the
races
yesterday
?
I
expected
to
see
you
there
,
''
*NL*
said
Vronsky
,
scrutinizing
Serpuhovskoy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
go
,
but
late
.
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
he
added
,
and
he
turned
to
the
*NL*
adjutant
:
``
Please
have
this
divided
from
me
,
each
man
as
much
as
it
runs
*NL*
to
.
''
And
he
hurriedly
took
notes
for
three
hundred
roubles
from
his
*NL*
pocketbook
,
blushing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vronsky
!
Have
anything
to
eat
or
drink
?
''
asked
Yashvin
.
``
Hi
,
something
*NL*
for
the
count
to
eat
!
Ah
,
here
it
is
:
have
a
glass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fete
at
the
colonel
's
lasted
a
long
while
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
drinking
.
They
tossed
Serpuhovskoy
in
the
air
and
caught
him
again
*NL*
several
times
.
Then
they
did
the
same
to
the
colonel
.
Then
,
to
the
*NL*
accompaniment
of
the
band
,
the
colonel
himself
danced
with
Petritsky
.
*NL*
Then
the
colonel
,
who
began
to
show
signs
of
feebleness
,
sat
down
on
a
*NL*
bench
in
the
courtyard
and
began
demonstrating
to
Yashvin
the
*NL*
superiority
of
Russia
over
Poland
,
especially
in
cavalry
attack
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
lull
in
the
revelry
for
a
moment
.
Serpuhovskoy
went
into
the
*NL*
house
to
the
bathroom
to
wash
his
hands
and
found
Vronsky
there
;
Vronsky
*NL*
was
drenching
his
head
with
water
.
He
had
taken
off
his
coat
and
put
his
*NL*
sunburnt
,
hairy
neck
under
the
tap
,
and
was
rubbing
it
and
his
head
with
*NL*
his
hands
.
When
he
had
finished
,
Vronsky
sat
down
by
Serpuhovskoy
.
They
*NL*
both
sat
down
in
the
bathroom
on
a
lounge
,
and
a
conversation
began
*NL*
which
was
very
interesting
to
both
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
always
been
hearing
about
you
through
my
wife
,
''
said
Serpuhovskoy
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
been
seeing
her
pretty
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
friendly
with
Varya
,
and
they
're
the
only
women
in
Petersburg
I
*NL*
care
about
seeing
,
''
answered
Vronsky
,
smiling
.
He
smiled
because
he
*NL*
foresaw
the
topic
the
conversation
would
turn
on
,
and
he
was
glad
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
ones
?
''
Serpuhovskoy
queried
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
heard
news
of
you
,
but
not
only
through
your
wife
,
''
said
*NL*
Vronsky
,
checking
his
hint
by
a
stern
expression
of
face
.
``
I
was
greatly
*NL*
delighted
to
hear
of
your
success
,
but
not
a
bit
surprised
.
I
expected
*NL*
even
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
smiled
.
Such
an
opinion
of
him
was
obviously
agreeable
to
*NL*
him
,
and
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
conceal
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
on
the
contrary
expected
less
--
I
'll
own
frankly
.
But
I
'm
glad
,
*NL*
very
glad
.
I
'm
ambitious
;
that
's
my
weakness
,
and
I
confess
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
would
n't
confess
to
it
if
you
had
n't
been
successful
,
''
said
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
so
,
''
said
Serpuhovskoy
,
smiling
again
.
``
I
wo
n't
say
*NL*
life
would
n't
be
worth
living
without
it
,
but
it
would
be
dull
.
Of
*NL*
course
I
may
be
mistaken
,
but
I
fancy
I
have
a
certain
capacity
for
the
*NL*
line
I
've
chosen
,
and
that
power
of
any
sort
in
my
hands
,
if
it
is
to
*NL*
be
,
will
be
better
than
in
the
hands
of
a
good
many
people
I
know
,
''
said
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
,
with
beaming
consciousness
of
success
;
``
and
so
the
nearer
*NL*
I
get
to
it
,
the
better
pleased
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
is
true
for
you
,
but
not
for
everyone
.
I
used
to
think
so
*NL*
too
,
but
here
I
live
and
think
life
worth
living
not
only
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
's
out
!
here
it
comes
!
''
said
Serpuhovskoy
,
laughing
.
``
Ever
*NL*
since
I
heard
about
you
,
about
your
refusal
,
I
began
...
Of
course
,
I
*NL*
approved
of
what
you
did
.
But
there
are
ways
of
doing
everything
.
And
I
*NL*
think
your
action
was
good
in
itself
,
but
you
did
n't
do
it
quite
in
the
*NL*
way
you
ought
to
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
done
ca
n't
be
undone
,
and
you
know
I
never
go
back
on
what
I
've
*NL*
done
.
And
besides
,
I
'm
very
well
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
off
--
for
the
time
.
But
you
're
not
satisfied
with
that
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
say
this
to
your
brother
.
He
's
a
nice
child
,
like
our
host
*NL*
here
.
There
he
goes
!
''
he
added
,
listening
to
the
roar
of
``
hurrah
!
''
--
``
and
*NL*
he
's
happy
,
but
that
does
not
satisfy
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
it
did
satisfy
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
that
's
not
the
only
thing
.
Such
men
as
you
are
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom
?
By
society
,
by
Russia
.
Russia
needs
men
;
she
needs
a
party
,
or
*NL*
else
everything
goes
and
will
go
to
the
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
Bertenev
's
party
against
the
Russian
communists
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Serpuhovskoy
,
frowning
with
vexation
at
being
suspected
of
*NL*
such
an
absurdity
.
''
_
Tout
ca
est
une
blague
_
.
That
's
always
been
and
*NL*
always
will
be
.
There
are
no
communists
.
But
intriguing
people
have
to
*NL*
invent
a
noxious
,
dangerous
party
.
It
's
an
old
trick
.
No
,
what
's
wanted
*NL*
is
a
powerful
party
of
independent
men
like
you
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
so
?
''
Vronsky
mentioned
a
few
men
who
were
in
power
.
``
Why
are
n't
*NL*
they
independent
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
because
they
have
not
,
or
have
not
had
from
birth
,
an
*NL*
independent
fortune
;
they
've
not
had
a
name
,
they
've
not
been
close
to
*NL*
the
sun
and
center
as
we
have
.
They
can
be
bought
either
by
money
or
by
*NL*
favor
.
And
they
have
to
find
a
support
for
themselves
in
inventing
a
*NL*
policy
.
And
they
bring
forward
some
notion
,
some
policy
that
they
do
n't
*NL*
believe
in
,
that
does
harm
;
and
the
whole
policy
is
really
only
a
means
*NL*
to
a
government
house
and
so
much
income
.
_
Cela
n'est
pas
plus

when
you
get
a
peep
at
their
cards

I
may
be
inferior
to
them

*NL*
stupider
perhaps
,
though
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
be
inferior
to
them
.
*NL*
But
you
and
I
have
one
important
advantage
over
them
for
certain
,
in
*NL*
being
more
difficult
to
buy
.
And
such
men
are
more
needed
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
listened
attentively
,
but
he
was
not
so
much
interested
by
the
*NL*
meaning
of
the
words
as
by
the
attitude
of
Serpuhovskoy
who
was
already
*NL*
contemplating
a
struggle
with
the
existing
powers
,
and
already
had
his
*NL*
likes
and
dislikes
in
that
higher
world
,
while
his
own
interest
in
the
*NL*
governing
world
did
not
go
beyond
the
interests
of
his
regiment
.
Vronsky
*NL*
felt
,
too
,
how
powerful
Serpuhovskoy
might
become
through
his
*NL*
unmistakable
faculty
for
thinking
things
out
and
for
taking
things
in
,
*NL*
through
his
intelligence
and
gift
of
words
,
so
rarely
met
with
in
the
*NL*
world
in
which
he
moved
.
And
,
ashamed
as
he
was
of
the
feeling
,
he
felt
*NL*
envious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
I
have
n't
the
one
thing
of
most
importance
for
that
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
;
``
I
have
n't
the
desire
for
power
.
I
had
it
once
,
but
it
's
*NL*
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
that
's
not
true
,
''
said
Serpuhovskoy
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
true
,
it
is
true
...
now
!
''
Vronsky
added
,
to
be
truthful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
true
now
,
that
's
another
thing
;
but
that
_
now
_
wo
n't
last
*NL*
forever

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
answered
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
_
perhaps
_
,
''
Serpuhovskoy
went
on
,
as
though
guessing
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
``
but
I
say
_
for
certain
_
.
And
that
's
what
I
wanted
to
see
you
*NL*
for

Your
action
was
just
what
it
should
have
been
.
I
see
that
,
but
you
*NL*
ought
not
to
keep
it
up

I
only
ask
you
to
give
me
carte
blanche

I
'm
*NL*
not
going
to
offer
you
my
protection

though
,
indeed
,
why
should
n't
I
*NL*
protect
you
?
--
you
've
protected
me
often
enough
!
I
should
hope
our
*NL*
friendship
rises
above
all
that
sort
of
thing
.
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
to
*NL*
him
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
,
``
give
me
_
carte
blanche
_
,
retire
from
the
*NL*
regiment
,
and
I
'll
draw
you
upwards
imperceptibly

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
understand
that
I
want
nothing

said
Vronsky
,
``
except
*NL*
that
all
should
be
as
it
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
got
up
and
stood
facing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
that
all
should
be
as
it
is
.
I
understand
what
that
means
.
But
*NL*
listen
:
we
're
the
same
age
,
you
've
known
a
greater
number
of
women
*NL*
perhaps
than
I
have
.
''
Serpohovskoy
's
smile
and
gestures
told
Vronsky
*NL*
that
he
must
n't
be
afraid
,
that
he
would
be
tender
and
careful
in
*NL*
touching
the
sore
place
.
``
But
I
'm
married
,
and
believe
me
,
in
getting
to
*NL*
know
thoroughly
one
's
wife
,
if
one
loves
her
,
as
someone
has
said
,
one
*NL*
gets
to
know
all
women
better
than
if
one
knew
thousands
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
coming
directly
!
''
Vronsky
shouted
to
an
officer
,
who
looked
into
*NL*
the
room
and
called
them
to
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
longing
now
to
hear
to
the
end
and
know
what
Serpuhovskey
*NL*
would
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
's
my
opinion
for
you
.
Women
are
the
chief
stumbling
block
in
a
*NL*
man
's
career
.
It
's
hard
to
love
a
woman
and
do
anything
.
There
's
only
*NL*
one
way
of
having
love
conveniently
without
its
being
a
*NL*
hindrance
--
that
's
marriage
.
How
,
how
am
I
to
tell
you
what
I
mean
?
''
said
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
,
who
liked
similes
.
``
Wait
a
minute
,
wait
a
minute
!
Yes
,
*NL*
just
as
you
can
only
carry
a
_
fardeau
_
and
do
something
with
your
hands
,
*NL*
when
the
fardeau
is
tied
on
your
back
,
and
that
's
marriage
.
And
that
's
*NL*
what
I
felt
when
I
was
married
.
My
hands
were
suddenly
set
free
.
But
to
*NL*
drag
that
_
fardeau
_
about
with
you
without
marriage
,
your
hands
will
*NL*
always
be
so
full
that
you
can
do
nothing
.
Look
at
Mazankov
,
at
Krupov
.
*NL*
They
've
ruined
their
careers
for
the
sake
of
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
women
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
recalling
the
Frenchwoman
and
the
actress
*NL*
with
whom
the
two
men
he
had
mentioned
were
connected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
firmer
the
woman
's
footing
in
society
,
the
worse
it
is
.
That
's
much
*NL*
the
same
as
--
not
merely
carrying
the
_
fardeau
_
in
your
arms
--
but
tearing
*NL*
it
away
from
someone
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
never
loved
,
''
Vronsky
said
softly
,
looking
straight
before
him
*NL*
and
thinking
of
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
But
you
remember
what
I
've
said
to
you
.
And
another
thing
,
*NL*
women
are
all
more
materialistic
than
men
.
We
make
something
immense
out
*NL*
of
love
,
but
they
are
always
_
terre-a-terre
_
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly

directly

he
cried
to
a
footman
who
came
in
.
But
the
footman
*NL*
had
not
come
to
call
them
again
,
as
he
supposed
.
The
footman
brought
*NL*
Vronsky
a
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
brought
it
from
Princess
Tverskaya

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
opened
the
letter
,
and
flushed
crimson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
's
begun
to
ache
;
I
'm
going
home

he
said
to
Serpuhovskoy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

good-bye
then

You

you
up

It
was
six
o'clock
already

so

in
order
to
be
there
quickly

at

the

not
to

horses
,
known
to
everyone
,
*NL*
Vronsky
got
into
Yashvin
's
hired
fly
,
and
told
the
driver
to
drive
as
*NL*
quickly
as
possible
.
It
was
a
roomy
,
old-fashioned
fly
,
with
seats
for
*NL*
four
.
He
sat
in
one
corner
,
stretched
his
legs
out
on
the
front
seat
,
*NL*
and
sank
into
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
vague
sense
of
the
order
into
which
his
affairs
had
been
brought
,
a
*NL*
vague
recollection
of
the
friendliness
and
flattery
of
Serpuhovskoy
,
who
*NL*
had
considered
him
a
man
that
was
needed
,
and
most
of
all
,
the
*NL*
anticipation
of
the
interview
before
him
--
all
blended
into
a
general
,
*NL*
joyous
sense
of
life
.
This
feeling
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
help
*NL*
smiling
.
He
dropped
his
legs
,
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
knee
,
and
*NL*
taking
it
in
his
hand
,
felt
the
springy
muscle
of
the
calf
,
where
it
had
*NL*
been
grazed
the
day
before
by
his
fall
,
and
leaning
back
he
drew
several
*NL*
deep
breaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
happy
,
very
happy
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
had
often
before
had
*NL*
this
sense
of
physical
joy
in
his
own
body
,
but
he
had
never
felt
so
*NL*
fond
of
himself
,
of
his
own
body
,
as
at
that
moment
.
He
enjoyed
the
*NL*
slight
ache
in
his
strong
leg
,
he
enjoyed
the
muscular
sensation
of
*NL*
movement
in
his
chest
as
he
breathed
.
The
bright
,
cold
August
day
,
which
*NL*
had
made
Anna
feel
so
hopeless
,
seemed
to
him
keenly
stimulating
,
and
*NL*
refreshed
his
face
and
neck
that
still
tingled
from
the
cold
water
.
The
*NL*
scent
of
brilliantine
on
his
whiskers
struck
him
as
particularly
*NL*
pleasant
in
the
fresh
air
.
Everything
he
saw
from
the
carriage
window
,
*NL*
everything
in
that
cold
pure
air
,
in
the
pale
light
of
the
sunset
,
was
*NL*
as
fresh
,
and
gay
,
and
strong
as
he
was
himself
:
the
roofs
of
the
houses
*NL*
shining
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
,
the
sharp
outlines
of
fences
and
*NL*
angles
of
buildings
,
the
figures
of
passers-by
,
the
carriages
that
met
*NL*
him
now
and
then
,
the
motionless
green
of
the
trees
and
grass
,
the
*NL*
fields
with
evenly
drawn
furrows
of
potatoes
,
and
the
slanting
shadows
*NL*
that
fell
from
the
houses
,
and
trees
,
and
bushes
,
and
even
from
the
rows
*NL*
of
potatoes
--
everything
was
bright
like
a
pretty
landscape
just
finished
*NL*
and
freshly
varnished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
on
,
get
on
!
''
he
said
to
the
driver
,
putting
his
head
out
of
the
*NL*
window
,
and
pulling
a
three-rouble
note
out
of
his
pocket
he
handed
it
*NL*
to
the
man
as
he
looked
round
.
The
driver
's
hand
fumbled
with
something
*NL*
at
the
lamp
,
the
whip
cracked
,
and
the
carriage
rolled
rapidly
along
the
*NL*
smooth
highroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
nothing
,
nothing
but
this
happiness
,
''
he
thought
,
staring
at
the
*NL*
bone
button
of
the
bell
in
the
space
between
the
windows
,
and
picturing
*NL*
to
himself
Anna
just
as
he
had
seen
her
last
time
.
``
And
as
I
go
on
,
I
*NL*
love
her
more
and
more
.
Here
's
the
garden
of
the
Vrede
Villa
.
*NL*
Whereabouts
will
she
be
?
Where
?
How
?
Why
did
she
fix
on
this
place
to
*NL*
meet
me
,
and
why
does
she
write
in
Betsy
's
letter
?
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
wondering
now
for
the
first
time
at
it
.
But
there
was
now
no
time
for
*NL*
wonder
.
He
called
to
the
driver
to
stop
before
reaching
the
avenue
,
and
*NL*
opening
the
door
,
jumped
out
of
the
carriage
as
it
was
moving
,
and
went
*NL*
into
the
avenue
that
led
up
to
the
house
.
There
was
no
one
in
the
*NL*
avenue
;
but
looking
round
to
the
right
he
caught
sight
of
her
.
Her
face
*NL*
was
hidden
by
a
veil
,
but
he
drank
in
with
glad
eyes
the
special
*NL*
movement
in
walking
,
peculiar
to
her
alone
,
the
slope
of
the
shoulders
,
*NL*
and
the
setting
of
the
head
,
and
at
once
a
sort
of
electric
shock
ran
*NL*
all
over
him
.
With
fresh
force
,
he
felt
conscious
of
himself
from
the
*NL*
springy
motions
of
his
legs
to
the
movements
of
his
lungs
as
he
*NL*
breathed
,
and
something
set
his
lips
twitching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joining
him
,
she
pressed
his
hand
tightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
angry
that
I
sent
for
you
?
I
absolutely
had
to
see
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
;
and
the
serious
and
set
line
of
her
lips
,
which
he
saw
under
the
*NL*
veil
,
transformed
his
mood
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
angry
!
But
how
have
you
come
,
where
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
she
said
,
laying
her
hand
on
his
,
``
come
along
,
I
must
talk
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
that
something
had
happened
,
and
that
the
interview
would
not
be
*NL*
a
joyous
one
.
In
her
presence
he
had
no
will
of
his
own
:
without
knowing
*NL*
the
grounds
of
her
distress
,
he
already
felt
the
same
distress
*NL*
unconsciously
passing
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
what
?
''
he
asked
her
,
squeezing
her
hand
with
his
elbow
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
read
her
thoughts
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
silence
,
gathering
up
her
courage
;
then
*NL*
suddenly
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
tell
you
yesterday
,
''
she
began
,
breathing
quickly
and
*NL*
painfully
,
``
that
coming
home
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
I
told
him
*NL*
everything
...
told
him
I
could
not
be
his
wife
,
that
...
and
told
him
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
her
,
unconsciously
bending
his
whole
figure
down
to
her
as
*NL*
though
hoping
in
this
way
to
soften
the
hardness
of
her
position
for
*NL*
her
.
But
directly
she
had
said
this
he
suddenly
drew
himself
up
,
and
a
*NL*
proud
and
hard
expression
came
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
better
,
a
thousand
times
better
!
I
know
how
painful
it
*NL*
was
,
''
he
said
.
But
she
was
not
listening
to
his
words
,
she
was
reading
*NL*
his
thoughts
from
the
expression
of
his
face
.
She
could
not
guess
that
*NL*
that
expression
arose
from
the
first
idea
that
presented
itself
to
*NL*
Vronsky
--
that
a
duel
was
now
inevitable
.
The
idea
of
a
duel
had
never
*NL*
crossed
her
mind
,
and
so
she
put
a
different
interpretation
on
this
*NL*
passing
expression
of
hardness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
her
husband
's
letter
,
she
knew
then
at
the
bottom
of
her
*NL*
heart
that
everything
would
go
on
in
the
old
way
,
that
she
would
not
*NL*
have
the
strength
of
will
to
forego
her
position
,
to
abandon
her
son
,
*NL*
and
to
join
her
lover
.
The
morning
spent
at
Princess
Tverskaya
's
had
*NL*
confirmed
her
still
more
in
this
.
But
this
interview
was
still
of
the
*NL*
utmost
gravity
for
her
.
She
hoped
that
this
interview
would
transform
*NL*
her
position
,
and
save
her
.
If
on
hearing
this
news
he
were
to
say
to
*NL*
her
resolutely
,
passionately
,
without
an
instant
's
wavering
:
``
Throw
up
*NL*
everything
and
come
with
me
!
''
she
would
give
up
her
son
and
go
away
with
*NL*
him
.
But
this
news
had
not
produced
what
she
had
expected
in
him
;
he
*NL*
simply
seemed
as
though
he
were
resenting
some
affront
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
in
the
least
painful
to
me
.
It
happened
of
itself
,
''
she
said
*NL*
irritably
;
``
and
see
...
''
she
pulled
her
husband
's
letter
out
of
her
*NL*
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
I
understand
,
''
he
interrupted
her
,
taking
the
letter
,
but
*NL*
not
reading
it
,
and
trying
to
soothe
her
.
``
The
one
thing
I
longed
for
,
*NL*
the
one
thing
I
prayed
for
,
was
to
cut
short
this
position
,
so
as
to
*NL*
devote
my
life
to
your
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
tell
me
that
?
''
she
said
.
``
Do
you
suppose
I
can
doubt
it
?
If
*NL*
I
doubted
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
coming
?
''
said
Vronsky
suddenly
,
pointing
to
two
ladies
*NL*
walking
towards
them
.
``
Perhaps
they
know
us
!
''
and
he
hurriedly
turned
*NL*
off
,
drawing
her
after
him
into
a
side
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
!
''
she
said
.
Her
lips
were
quivering
.
And
he
fancied
*NL*
that
her
eyes
looked
with
strange
fury
at
him
from
under
the
veil
.
``
I
*NL*
tell
you
that
's
not
the
point
--
I
ca
n't
doubt
that
;
but
see
what
he
*NL*
writes
to
me
.
Read
it
.
''
She
stood
still
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
just
as
at
the
first
moment
of
hearing
of
her
rupture
with
her
*NL*
husband
,
Vronsky
,
on
reading
the
letter
,
was
unconsciously
carried
away
*NL*
by
the
natural
sensation
aroused
in
him
by
his
own
relation
to
the
*NL*
betrayed
husband
.
Now
while
he
held
his
letter
in
his
hands
,
he
could
*NL*
not
help
picturing
the
challenge
,
which
he
would
most
likely
find
at
*NL*
home
today
or
tomorrow
,
and
the
duel
itself
,
in
which
,
with
the
same
*NL*
cold
and
haughty
expression
that
his
face
was
assuming
at
this
moment
he
*NL*
would
await
the
injured
husband
's
shot
,
after
having
himself
fired
into
*NL*
the
air
.
And
at
that
instant
there
flashed
across
his
mind
the
thought
*NL*
of
what
Serpuhovskoy
had
just
said
to
him
,
and
what
he
had
himself
been
*NL*
thinking
in
the
morning
--
that
it
was
better
not
to
bind
himself
--
and
he
*NL*
knew
that
this
thought
he
could
not
tell
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
read
the
letter
,
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
determination
in
them
.
She
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
thinking
about
*NL*
it
before
by
himself
.
She
knew
that
whatever
he
might
say
to
her
,
he
*NL*
would
not
say
all
he
thought
.
And
she
knew
that
her
last
hope
had
failed
*NL*
her
.
This
was
not
what
she
had
been
reckoning
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
the
sort
of
man
he
is
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
shaking
voice
;
``
he
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
but
I
rejoice
at
it
,
''
Vronsky
interrupted
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
*NL*
let
me
finish
!
''
he
added
,
his
eyes
imploring
her
to
give
him
time
to
*NL*
explain
his
words
.
``
I
rejoice
,
because
things
can
not
,
can
not
possibly
*NL*
remain
as
he
supposes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
they
?
''
Anna
said
,
restraining
her
tears
,
and
obviously
*NL*
attaching
no
sort
of
consequence
to
what
he
said
.
She
felt
that
her
fate
*NL*
was
sealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
meant
that
after
the
duel
--
inevitable
,
he
thought
--
things
could
*NL*
not
go
on
as
before
,
but
he
said
something
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
go
on
.
I
hope
that
now
you
will
leave
him
.
I
hope
''
--
he
was
*NL*
confused
,
and
reddened
--
``
that
you
will
let
me
arrange
and
plan
our
life
.
*NL*
Tomorrow
...
''
he
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
let
him
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
child
!
''
she
shrieked
.
``
You
see
what
he
writes
!
I
should
have
to
*NL*
leave
him
,
and
I
ca
n't
and
wo
n't
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
for
God
's
sake
,
which
is
better
?
--
leave
your
child
,
or
keep
up
*NL*
this
degrading
position
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
is
it
degrading
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
all
,
and
most
of
all
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
degrading
...
do
n't
say
that
.
Those
words
have
no
meaning
for
*NL*
me
,
''
she
said
in
a
shaking
voice
.
She
did
not
want
him
now
to
say
what
*NL*
was
untrue
.
She
had
nothing
left
her
but
his
love
,
and
she
wanted
to
*NL*
love
him
.
``
Do
n't
you
understand
that
from
the
day
I
loved
you
everything
*NL*
has
changed
for
me
?
For
me
there
is
one
thing
,
and
one
thing
only
--
your
*NL*
love
.
If
that
's
mine
,
I
feel
so
exalted
,
so
strong
,
that
nothing
can
be
*NL*
humiliating
to
me
.
I
am
proud
of
my
position
,
because
...
proud
of
being
*NL*
...
proud
...
''
She
could
not
say
what
she
was
proud
of
.
Tears
of
shame
*NL*
and
despair
choked
her
utterance
.
She
stood
still
and
sobbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
,
too
,
something
swelling
in
his
throat
and
twitching
in
his
*NL*
nose
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
on
the
point
of
*NL*
weeping
.
He
could
not
have
said
exactly
what
it
was
touched
him
so
.
He
*NL*
felt
sorry
for
her
,
and
he
felt
he
could
not
help
her
,
and
with
that
he
*NL*
knew
that
he
was
to
blame
for
her
wretchedness
,
and
that
he
had
done
*NL*
something
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
a
divorce
possible
?
''
he
said
feebly
.
She
shook
her
head
,
not
*NL*
answering
.
``
Could
n't
you
take
your
son
,
and
still
leave
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
it
all
depends
on
him
.
Now
I
must
go
to
him
,
''
she
said
*NL*
shortly
.
Her
presentiment
that
all
would
again
go
on
in
the
old
way
had
*NL*
not
deceived
her
.
*NL*
*NL*

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
Monday
there
was
the
usual
sitting
of
the
Commission
of
the
2nd
of
*NL*
June
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
walked
into
the
hall
where
the
sitting
was
*NL*
held
,
greeted
the
members
and
the
president
,
as
usual
,
and
sat
down
in
*NL*
his
place
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
papers
laid
ready
before
him
.
Among
*NL*
these
papers
lay
the
necessary
evidence
and
a
rough
outline
of
the
*NL*
speech
he
intended
to
make
.
But
he
did
not
really
need
these
documents
.
*NL*
He
remembered
every
point
,
and
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
go
over
in
*NL*
his
memory
what
he
would
say
.
He
knew
that
when
the
time
came
,
and
when
*NL*
he
saw
his
enemy
facing
him
,
and
studiously
endeavoring
to
assume
an
*NL*
expression
of
indifference
,
his
speech
would
flow
of
itself
better
than
*NL*
he
could
prepare
it
now
.
He
felt
that
the
import
of
his
speech
was
of
*NL*
such
magnitude
that
every
word
of
it
would
have
weight
.
Meantime
,
as
he
*NL*
listened
to
the
usual
report
,
he
had
the
most
innocent
and
inoffensive
*NL*
air
.
No
one
,
looking
at
his
white
hands
,
with
their
swollen
veins
and
*NL*
long
fingers
,
so
softly
stroking
the
edges
of
the
white
paper
that
lay
*NL*
before
him
,
and
at
the
air
of
weariness
with
which
his
head
drooped
on
*NL*
one
side
,
would
have
suspected
that
in
a
few
minutes
a
torrent
of
words
*NL*
would
flow
from
his
lips
that
would
arouse
a
fearful
storm
,
set
the
*NL*
members
shouting
and
attacking
one
another
,
and
force
the
president
to
*NL*
call
for
order
.
When
the
report
was
over
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
announced
in
his
subdued
,
delicate
voice
that
he
had
several
points
to
*NL*
bring
before
the
meeting
in
regard
to
the
Commission
for
the
*NL*
Reorganization
of
the
Native
Tribes
.
All
attention
was
turned
upon
him
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
cleared
his
throat
,
and
not
looking
at
his
*NL*
opponent
,
but
selecting
,
as
he
always
did
while
he
was
delivering
his
*NL*
speeches
,
the
first
person
sitting
opposite
him
,
an
inoffensive
little
*NL*
old
man
,
who
never
had
an
opinion
of
any
sort
in
the
Commission
,
began
*NL*
to
expound
his
views
.
When
he
reached
the
point
about
the
fundamental
*NL*
and
radical
law
,
his
opponent
jumped
up
and
began
to
protest
.
Stremov
,
*NL*
who
was
also
a
member
of
the
Commission
,
and
also
stung
to
the
quick
,
*NL*
began
defending
himself
,
and
altogether
a
stormy
sitting
followed
;
but
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
triumphed
,
and
his
motion
was
carried
,
three
new
*NL*
commissions
were
appointed
,
and
the
next
day
in
a
certain
Petersburg
*NL*
circle
nothing
else
was
talked
of
but
this
sitting
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
success
had
been
even
greater
than
he
had
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
Tuesday
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
on
waking
up
,
recollected
*NL*
with
pleasure
his
triumph
of
the
previous
day
,
and
he
could
not
help
*NL*
smiling
,
though
he
tried
to
appear
indifferent
,
when
the
chief
secretary
*NL*
of
his
department
,
anxious
to
flatter
him
,
informed
him
of
the
rumors
*NL*
that
had
reached
him
concerning
what
had
happened
in
the
Commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absorbed
in
business
with
the
chief
secretary
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
*NL*
completely
forgotten
that
it
was
Tuesday
,
the
day
fixed
by
him
for
the
*NL*
return
of
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
and
he
was
surprised
and
received
a
shock
of
*NL*
annoyance
when
a
servant
came
in
to
inform
him
of
her
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
arrived
in
Petersburg
early
in
the
morning
;
the
carriage
had
*NL*
been
sent
to
meet
her
in
accordance
with
her
telegram
,
and
so
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
might
have
known
of
her
arrival
.
But
when
she
arrived
,
he
*NL*
did
not
meet
her
.
She
was
told
that
he
had
not
yet
gone
out
,
but
was
*NL*
busy
with
his
secretary
.
She
sent
word
to
her
husband
that
she
had
come
,
*NL*
went
to
her
own
room
,
and
occupied
herself
in
sorting
out
her
things
,
*NL*
expecting
he
would
come
to
her
.
But
an
hour
passed
;
he
did
not
come
.
She
*NL*
went
into
the
dining
room
on
the
pretext
of
giving
some
directions
,
and
*NL*
spoke
loudly
on
purpose
,
expecting
him
to
come
out
there
;
but
he
did
not
*NL*
come
,
though
she
heard
him
go
to
the
door
of
his
study
as
he
parted
from
*NL*
the
chief
secretary
.
She
knew
that
he
usually
went
out
quickly
to
his
*NL*
office
,
and
she
wanted
to
see
him
before
that
,
so
that
their
attitude
to
*NL*
one
another
might
be
defined
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
across
the
drawing
room
and
went
resolutely
to
him
.
When
she
*NL*
went
into
his
study
he
was
in
official
uniform
,
obviously
ready
to
go
*NL*
out
,
sitting
at
a
little
table
on
which
he
rested
his
elbows
,
looking
*NL*
dejectedly
before
him
.
She
saw
him
before
he
saw
her
,
and
she
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
thinking
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
seeing
her
,
he
would
have
risen
,
but
changed
his
mind
,
then
his
face
*NL*
flushed
hotly
--
a
thing
Anna
had
never
seen
before
,
and
he
got
up
quickly
*NL*
and
went
to
meet
her
,
looking
not
at
her
eyes
,
but
above
them
at
her
*NL*
forehead
and
hair
.
He
went
up
to
her
,
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
asked
*NL*
her
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
you
have
come
,
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
beside
her
,
and
*NL*
obviously
wishing
to
say
something
,
he
stuttered
.
Several
times
he
tried
*NL*
to
begin
to
speak
,
but
stopped
.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
,
preparing
*NL*
herself
for
meeting
him
,
she
had
schooled
herself
to
despise
and
*NL*
reproach
him
,
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
him
,
and
she
felt
sorry
*NL*
for
him
.
And
so
the
silence
lasted
for
some
time
.
``
Is
Seryozha
quite
*NL*
well
?
''
he
said
,
and
not
waiting
for
an
answer
,
he
added
:
``
I
sha
n't
be
*NL*
dining
at
home
today
,
and
I
have
got
to
go
out
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
thought
of
going
to
Moscow
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
quite
,
quite
right
to
come
,
''
he
said
,
and
was
silent
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
he
was
powerless
to
begin
the
conversation
,
she
began
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
and
not
dropping
her
*NL*
eyes
under
his
persistent
gaze
at
her
hair
,
``
I
'm
a
guilty
woman
,
I
'm
a
*NL*
bad
woman
,
but
I
am
the
same
as
I
was
,
as
I
told
you
then
,
and
I
have
*NL*
come
to
tell
you
that
I
can
change
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
asked
you
no
question
about
that
,
''
he
said
,
all
at
once
,
*NL*
resolutely
and
with
hatred
looking
her
straight
in
the
face
;
``
that
was
*NL*
as
I
had
supposed
.
''
Under
the
influence
of
anger
he
apparently
regained
*NL*
complete
possession
of
all
his
faculties
.
``
But
as
I
told
you
then
,
and
*NL*
have
written
to
you
,
''
he
said
in
a
thin
,
shrill
voice
,
``
I
repeat
now
,
*NL*
that
I
am
not
bound
to
know
this
.
I
ignore
it
.
Not
all
wives
are
so
kind
*NL*
as
you
,
to
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
communicate
such
agreeable
news
to
*NL*
their
husbands
.
''
He
laid
special
emphasis
on
the
word
``
agreeable
.
''
``
I
*NL*
shall
ignore
it
so
long
as
the
world
knows
nothing
of
it
,
so
long
as
my
*NL*
name
is
not
disgraced
.
And
so
I
simply
inform
you
that
our
relations
*NL*
must
be
just
as
they
have
always
been
,
and
that
only
in
the
event
of
*NL*
your
compromising
me
I
shall
be
obliged
to
take
steps
to
secure
my
*NL*
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
our
relations
can
not
be
the
same
as
always
,
''
Anna
began
in
a
timid
*NL*
voice
,
looking
at
him
with
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
once
more
those
composed
gestures
,
heard
that
shrill
,
*NL*
childish
,
and
sarcastic
voice
,
her
aversion
for
him
extinguished
her
*NL*
pity
for
him
,
and
she
felt
only
afraid
,
but
at
all
costs
she
wanted
to
*NL*
make
clear
her
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
be
your
wife
while
I.
...
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
a
cold
and
malignant
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
manner
of
life
you
have
chosen
is
reflected
,
I
suppose
,
in
your
*NL*
ideas
.
I
have
too
much
respect
or
contempt
,
or
both
...
I
respect
your
*NL*
past
and
despise
your
present
...
that
I
was
far
from
the
interpretation
*NL*
you
put
on
my
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
sighed
and
bowed
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
indeed
I
fail
to
comprehend
how
,
with
the
independence
you
*NL*
show
,
''
he
went
on
,
getting
hot
,
''
--
announcing
your
infidelity
to
your
*NL*
husband
and
seeing
nothing
reprehensible
in
it
,
apparently
--
you
can
see
*NL*
anything
reprehensible
in
performing
a
wife
's
duties
in
relation
to
your
*NL*
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
What
is
it
you
want
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
not
to
meet
that
man
here
,
and
to
conduct
yourself
so
that
*NL*
neither
the
world
nor
the
servants
can
reproach
you
...
not
to
see
him
.
*NL*
That
's
not
much
,
I
think
.
And
in
return
you
will
enjoy
all
the
*NL*
privileges
of
a
faithful
wife
without
fulfilling
her
duties
.
That
's
all
*NL*
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
Now
it
's
time
for
me
to
go
.
I
'm
not
dining
at
*NL*
home

''
He
got
up
and
moved
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
got
up
too
.
Bowing
in
silence
,
he
let
her
pass
before
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
spent
by
Levin
on
the
haycock
did
not
pass
without
result
for
*NL*
him
.
The
way
in
which
he
had
been
managing
his
land
revolted
him
and
had
*NL*
lost
all
attraction
for
him
.
In
spite
of
the
magnificent
harvest
,
never
*NL*
had
there
been
,
or
,
at
least
,
never
it
seemed
to
him
,
had
there
been
so
*NL*
many
hindrances
and
so
many
quarrels
between
him
and
the
peasants
as
*NL*
that
year
,
and
the
origin
of
these
failures
and
this
hostility
was
now
*NL*
perfectly
comprehensible
to
him
.
The
delight
he
had
experienced
in
the
*NL*
work
itself
,
and
the
consequent
greater
intimacy
with
the
peasants
,
the
*NL*
envy
he
felt
of
them
,
of
their
life
,
the
desire
to
adopt
that
life
,
*NL*
which
had
been
to
him
that
night
not
a
dream
but
an
intention
,
the
*NL*
execution
of
which
he
had
thought
out
in
detail
--
all
this
had
so
*NL*
transformed
his
view
of
the
farming
of
the
land
as
he
had
managed
it
,
*NL*
that
he
could
not
take
his
former
interest
in
it
,
and
could
not
help
*NL*
seeing
that
unpleasant
relation
between
him
and
the
workpeople
which
was
*NL*
the
foundation
of
it
all
.
The
herd
of
improved
cows
such
as
Pava
,
the
*NL*
whole
land
ploughed
over
and
enriched
,
the
nine
level
fields
surrounded
*NL*
with
hedges
,
the
two
hundred
and
forty
acres
heavily
manured
,
the
seed
*NL*
sown
in
drills
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
--
it
was
all
splendid
if
only
the
*NL*
work
had
been
done
for
themselves
,
or
for
themselves
and
*NL*
comrades
--
people
in
sympathy
with
them
.
But
he
saw
clearly
now
-LRB-
his
work
*NL*
on
a
book
of
agriculture
,
in
which
the
chief
element
in
husbandry
was
to
*NL*
have
been
the
laborer
,
greatly
assisted
him
in
this
-RRB-
that
the
sort
of
*NL*
farming
he
was
carrying
on
was
nothing
but
a
cruel
and
stubborn
struggle
*NL*
between
him
and
the
laborers
,
in
which
there
was
on
one
side
--
his
*NL*
side
--
a
continual
intense
effort
to
change
everything
to
a
pattern
he
*NL*
considered
better
;
on
the
other
side
,
the
natural
order
of
things
.
And
*NL*
in
this
struggle
he
saw
that
with
immense
expenditure
of
force
on
his
*NL*
side
,
and
with
no
effort
or
even
intention
on
the
other
side
,
all
that
*NL*
was
attained
was
that
the
work
did
not
go
to
the
liking
of
either
side
,
*NL*
and
that
splendid
tools
,
splendid
cattle
and
land
were
spoiled
with
no
*NL*
good
to
anyone
.
Worst
of
all
,
the
energy
expended
on
this
work
was
not
*NL*
simply
wasted
.
He
could
not
help
feeling
now
,
since
the
meaning
of
this
*NL*
system
had
become
clear
to
him
,
that
the
aim
of
his
energy
was
a
most
*NL*
unworthy
one
.
In
reality
,
what
was
the
struggle
about
?
He
was
struggling
*NL*
for
every
farthing
of
his
share
-LRB-
and
he
could
not
help
it
,
for
he
had
*NL*
only
to
relax
his
efforts
,
and
he
would
not
have
had
the
money
to
pay
*NL*
his
laborers
'
wages
-RRB-
,
while
they
were
only
struggling
to
be
able
to
do
*NL*
their
work
easily
and
agreeably
,
that
is
to
say
,
as
they
were
used
to
*NL*
doing
it
.
It
was
for
his
interests
that
every
laborer
should
work
as
*NL*
hard
as
possible
,
and
that
while
doing
so
he
should
keep
his
wits
about
*NL*
him
,
so
as
to
try
not
to
break
the
winnowing
machines
,
the
horse
rakes
,
*NL*
the
thrashing
machines
,
that
he
should
attend
to
what
he
was
doing
.
What
*NL*
the
laborer
wanted
was
to
work
as
pleasantly
as
possible
,
with
rests
,
*NL*
and
above
all
,
carelessly
and
heedlessly
,
without
thinking
.
That
summer
*NL*
Levin
saw
this
at
every
step
.
He
sent
the
men
to
mow
some
clover
for
*NL*
hay
,
picking
out
the
worst
patches
where
the
clover
was
overgrown
with
*NL*
grass
and
weeds
and
of
no
use
for
seed
;
again
and
again
they
mowed
the
*NL*
best
acres
of
clover
,
justifying
themselves
by
the
pretense
that
the
*NL*
bailiff
had
told
them
to
,
and
trying
to
pacify
him
with
the
assurance
*NL*
that
it
would
be
splendid
hay
;
but
he
knew
that
it
was
owing
to
those
*NL*
acres
being
so
much
easier
to
mow
.
He
sent
out
a
hay
machine
for
*NL*
pitching
the
hay
--
it
was
broken
at
the
first
row
because
it
was
dull
*NL*
work
for
a
peasant
to
sit
on
the
seat
in
front
with
the
great
wings
*NL*
waving
above
him
.
And
he
was
told
,
``
Do
n't
trouble
,
your
honor
,
sure
,
the
*NL*
womenfolks
will
pitch
it
quick
enough
.
''
The
ploughs
were
practically
*NL*
useless
,
because
it
never
occurred
to
the
laborer
to
raise
the
share
*NL*
when
he
turned
the
plough
,
and
forcing
it
round
,
he
strained
the
horses
*NL*
and
tore
up
the
ground
,
and
Levin
was
begged
not
to
mind
about
it
.
The
*NL*
horses
were
allowed
to
stray
into
the
wheat
because
not
a
single
laborer
*NL*
would
consent
to
be
night-watchman
,
and
in
spite
of
orders
to
the
*NL*
contrary
,
the
laborers
insisted
on
taking
turns
for
night
duty
,
and
*NL*
Ivan
,
after
working
all
day
long
,
fell
asleep
,
and
was
very
penitent
for
*NL*
his
fault
,
saying
,
``
Do
what
you
will
to
me
,
your
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
killed
three
of
the
best
calves
by
letting
them
into
the
clover
*NL*
aftermath
without
care
as
to
their
drinking
,
and
nothing
would
make
the
*NL*
men
believe
that
they
had
been
blown
out
by
the
clover
,
but
they
told
*NL*
him
,
by
way
of
consolation
,
that
one
of
his
neighbors
had
lost
a
hundred
*NL*
and
twelve
head
of
cattle
in
three
days
.
All
this
happened
,
not
because
*NL*
anyone
felt
ill-will
to
Levin
or
his
farm
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
knew
that
*NL*
they
liked
him
,
thought
him
a
simple
gentleman
-LRB-
their
highest
praise
-RRB-
;
*NL*
but
it
happened
simply
because
all
they
wanted
was
to
work
merrily
and
*NL*
carelessly
,
and
his
interests
were
not
only
remote
and
incomprehensible
*NL*
to
them
,
but
fatally
opposed
to
their
most
just
claims
.
Long
before
,
*NL*
Levin
had
felt
dissatisfaction
with
his
own
position
in
regard
to
the
*NL*
land
.
He
saw
where
his
boat
leaked
,
but
he
did
not
look
for
the
leak
,
*NL*
perhaps
purposely
deceiving
himself
.
-LRB-
Nothing
would
be
left
him
if
he
*NL*
lost
faith
in
it
.
-RRB-
But
now
he
could
deceive
himself
no
longer
.
The
*NL*
farming
of
the
land
,
as
he
was
managing
it
,
had
become
not
merely
*NL*
unattractive
but
revolting
to
him
,
and
he
could
take
no
further
interest
*NL*
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
now
was
joined
the
presence
,
only
twenty-five
miles
off
,
of
*NL*
Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya
,
whom
he
longed
to
see
and
could
not
see
.
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
Oblonskaya
had
invited
him
,
when
he
was
over
there
,
to
*NL*
come
;
to
come
with
the
object
of
renewing
his
offer
to
her
sister
,
who
*NL*
would
,
so
she
gave
him
to
understand
,
accept
him
now
.
Levin
himself
had
*NL*
felt
on
seeing
Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya
that
he
had
never
ceased
to
love
*NL*
her
;
but
he
could
not
go
over
to
the
Oblonskys
'
,
knowing
she
was
there
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
had
made
her
an
offer
,
and
she
had
refused
him
,
had
*NL*
placed
an
insuperable
barrier
between
her
and
him
.
``
I
ca
n't
ask
her
to
*NL*
be
my
wife
merely
because
she
ca
n't
be
the
wife
of
the
man
she
wanted
to
*NL*
marry
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
The
thought
of
this
made
him
cold
and
*NL*
hostile
to
her
.
``
I
should
not
be
able
to
speak
to
her
without
a
feeling
*NL*
of
reproach
;
I
could
not
look
at
her
without
resentment
;
and
she
will
*NL*
only
hate
me
all
the
more
,
as
she
's
bound
to
.
And
besides
,
how
can
I
*NL*
now
,
after
what
Darya
Alexandrovna
told
me
,
go
to
see
them
?
Can
I
help
*NL*
showing
that
I
know
what
she
told
me
?
And
me
to
go
magnanimously
to
*NL*
forgive
her
,
and
have
pity
on
her
!
Me
go
through
a
performance
before
*NL*
her
of
forgiving
,
and
deigning
to
bestow
my
love
on
her
!
...
What
induced
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
to
tell
me
that
?
By
chance
I
might
have
seen
her
,
*NL*
then
everything
would
have
happened
of
itself
;
but
,
as
it
is
,
it
's
out
*NL*
of
the
question
,
out
of
the
question
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
sent
him
a
letter
,
asking
him
for
a
side-saddle
for
*NL*
Kitty
's
use
.
``
I
'm
told
you
have
a
side-saddle
,
''
she
wrote
to
him
;
``
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
bring
it
over
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
more
than
he
could
stand
.
How
could
a
woman
of
any
*NL*
intelligence
,
of
any
delicacy
,
put
her
sister
in
such
a
humiliating
*NL*
position
!
He
wrote
ten
notes
,
and
tore
them
all
up
,
and
sent
the
saddle
*NL*
without
any
reply
.
To
write
that
he
would
go
was
impossible
,
because
he
*NL*
could
not
go
;
to
write
that
he
could
not
come
because
something
*NL*
prevented
him
,
or
that
he
would
be
away
,
that
was
still
worse
.
He
sent
*NL*
the
saddle
without
an
answer
,
and
with
a
sense
of
having
done
something
*NL*
shameful
;
he
handed
over
all
the
now
revolting
business
of
the
estate
to
*NL*
the
bailiff
,
and
set
off
next
day
to
a
remote
district
to
see
his
friend
*NL*
Sviazhsky
,
who
had
splendid
marshes
for
grouse
in
his
neighborhood
,
and
*NL*
had
lately
written
to
ask
him
to
keep
a
long-standing
promise
to
stay
*NL*
with
him
.
The
grouse-marsh
,
in
the
Surovsky
district
,
had
long
tempted
*NL*
Levin
,
but
he
had
continually
put
off
this
visit
on
account
of
his
work
*NL*
on
the
estate
.
Now
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
,
and
still
more
from
his
farm
work
,
especially
on
a
*NL*
shooting
expedition
,
which
always
in
trouble
served
as
the
best
*NL*
consolation
.

*NL*
In
the
Surovsky
district
there
was
no
railway
nor
service
of
post
*NL*
horses
,
and
Levin
drove
there
with
his
own
horses
in
his
big
,
*NL*
old-fashioned
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
halfway
at
a
well-to-do
peasant
's
to
feed
his
horses
.
A
bald
,
*NL*
well-preserved
old
man
,
with
a
broad
,
red
beard
,
gray
on
his
cheeks
,
*NL*
opened
the
gate
,
squeezing
against
the
gatepost
to
let
the
three
horses
*NL*
pass
.
Directing
the
coachman
to
a
place
under
the
shed
in
the
big
,
*NL*
clean
,
tidy
yard
,
with
charred
,
old-fashioned
ploughs
in
it
,
the
old
man
*NL*
asked
Levin
to
come
into
the
parlor
.
A
cleanly
dressed
young
woman
,
with
*NL*
clogs
on
her
bare
feet
,
was
scrubbing
the
floor
in
the
new
outer
room
.
*NL*
She
was
frightened
of
the
dog
,
that
ran
in
after
Levin
,
and
uttered
a
*NL*
shriek
,
but
began
laughing
at
her
own
fright
at
once
when
she
was
told
*NL*
the
dog
would
not
hurt
her
.
Pointing
Levin
with
her
bare
arm
to
the
door
*NL*
into
the
parlor
,
she
bent
down
again
,
hiding
her
handsome
face
,
and
went
*NL*
on
scrubbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
the
samovar
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlor
was
a
big
room
,
with
a
Dutch
stove
,
and
a
screen
dividing
it
*NL*
into
two
.
Under
the
holy
pictures
stood
a
table
painted
in
patterns
,
a
*NL*
bench
,
and
two
chairs
.
Near
the
entrance
was
a
dresser
full
of
crockery
.
*NL*
The
shutters
were
closed
,
there
were
few
flies
,
and
it
was
so
clean
that
*NL*
Levin
was
anxious
that
Laska
,
who
had
been
running
along
the
road
and
*NL*
bathing
in
puddles
,
should
not
muddy
the
floor
,
and
ordered
her
to
a
*NL*
place
in
the
corner
by
the
door
.
After
looking
round
the
parlor
,
Levin
*NL*
went
out
in
the
back
yard
.
The
good-looking
young
woman
in
clogs
,
*NL*
swinging
the
empty
pails
on
the
yoke
,
ran
on
before
him
to
the
well
for
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
sharp
,
my
girl
!
''
the
old
man
shouted
after
her
,
good-humoredly
,
*NL*
and
he
went
up
to
Levin
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
are
you
going
to
Nikolay
Ivanovitch
*NL*
Sviazhsky
?
His
honor
comes
to
us
too
,
''
he
began
,
chatting
,
leaning
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
railing
of
the
steps
.
In
the
middle
of
the
old
man
's
*NL*
account
of
his
acquaintance
with
Sviazhsky
,
the
gates
creaked
again
,
and
*NL*
laborers
came
into
the
yard
from
the
fields
,
with
wooden
ploughs
and
*NL*
harrows
.
The
horses
harnessed
to
the
ploughs
and
harrows
were
sleek
and
*NL*
fat
.
The
laborers
were
obviously
of
the
household
:
two
were
young
men
in
*NL*
cotton
shirts
and
caps
,
the
two
others
were
hired
laborers
in
homespun
*NL*
shirts
,
one
an
old
man
,
the
other
a
young
fellow
.
Moving
off
from
the
*NL*
steps
,
the
old
man
went
up
to
the
horses
and
began
unharnessing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
they
been
ploughing
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ploughing
up
the
potatoes
.
We
rent
a
bit
of
land
too
.
Fedot
,
do
n't
let
*NL*
out
the
gelding
,
but
take
it
to
the
trough
,
and
we
'll
put
the
other
in
*NL*
harness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
father
,
the
ploughshares
I
ordered
,
has
he
brought
them
along
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
big
,
healthy-looking
fellow
,
obviously
the
old
man
's
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
...
in
the
outer
room
,
''
answered
the
old
man
,
bundling
together
*NL*
the
harness
he
had
taken
off
,
and
flinging
it
on
the
ground
.
``
You
can
*NL*
put
them
on
,
while
they
have
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
good-looking
young
woman
came
into
the
outer
room
with
the
full
*NL*
pails
dragging
at
her
shoulders
.
More
women
came
on
the
scene
from
*NL*
somewhere
,
young
and
handsome
,
middle-aged
,
old
and
ugly
,
with
children
*NL*
and
without
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
samovar
was
beginning
to
sing
;
the
laborers
and
the
family
,
having
*NL*
disposed
of
the
horses
,
came
in
to
dinner
.
Levin
,
getting
his
provisions
*NL*
out
of
his
carriage
,
invited
the
old
man
to
take
tea
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
had
some
today
already
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
obviously
*NL*
accepting
the
invitation
with
pleasure
.
``
But
just
a
glass
for
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Over
their
tea
Levin
heard
all
about
the
old
man
's
farming
.
Ten
years
*NL*
before
,
the
old
man
had
rented
three
hundred
acres
from
the
lady
who
*NL*
owned
them
,
and
a
year
ago
he
had
bought
them
and
rented
another
three
*NL*
hundred
from
a
neighboring
landowner
.
A
small
part
of
the
land
--
the
*NL*
worst
part
--
he
let
out
for
rent
,
while
a
hundred
acres
of
arable
land
he
*NL*
cultivated
himself
with
his
family
and
two
hired
laborers
.
The
old
man
*NL*
complained
that
things
were
doing
badly
.
But
Levin
saw
that
he
simply
*NL*
did
so
from
a
feeling
of
propriety
,
and
that
his
farm
was
in
a
*NL*
flourishing
condition
.
If
it
had
been
unsuccessful
he
would
not
have
*NL*
bought
land
at
thirty-five
roubles
the
acre
,
he
would
not
have
married
*NL*
his
three
sons
and
a
nephew
,
he
would
not
have
rebuilt
twice
after
*NL*
fires
,
and
each
time
on
a
larger
scale
.
In
spite
of
the
old
man
's
*NL*
complaints
,
it
was
evident
that
he
was
proud
,
and
justly
proud
,
of
his
*NL*
prosperity
,
proud
of
his
sons
,
his
nephew
,
his
sons
'
wives
,
his
horses
*NL*
and
his
cows
,
and
especially
of
the
fact
that
he
was
keeping
all
this
*NL*
farming
going
.
From
his
conversation
with
the
old
man
,
Levin
thought
he
*NL*
was
not
averse
to
new
methods
either
.
He
had
planted
a
great
many
*NL*
potatoes
,
and
his
potatoes
,
as
Levin
had
seen
driving
past
,
were
already
*NL*
past
flowering
and
beginning
to
die
down
,
while
Levin
's
were
only
just
*NL*
coming
into
flower
.
He
earthed
up
his
potatoes
with
a
modern
plough
*NL*
borrowed
from
a
neighboring
landowner
.
He
sowed
wheat
.
The
trifling
fact
*NL*
that
,
thinning
out
his
rye
,
the
old
man
used
the
rye
he
thinned
out
for
*NL*
his
horses
,
specially
struck
Levin
.
How
many
times
had
Levin
seen
this
*NL*
splendid
fodder
wasted
,
and
tried
to
get
it
saved
;
but
always
it
had
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
impossible
.
The
peasant
got
this
done
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
say
enough
in
praise
of
it
as
food
for
the
beasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
the
wenches
to
do
?
They
carry
it
out
in
bundles
to
the
*NL*
roadside
,
and
the
cart
brings
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
landowners
ca
n't
manage
well
with
our
laborers
,
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
handing
him
a
glass
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
and
he
took
the
glass
,
but
refused
sugar
,
*NL*
pointing
to
a
lump
he
had
left
.
``
They
're
simple
destruction
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
``
Look
at
Sviazhsky
's
,
for
instance
.
We
know
what
the
land
's
*NL*
like
--
first-rate
,
yet
there
's
not
much
of
a
crop
to
boast
of
.
It
's
not
*NL*
looked
after
enough
--
that
's
all
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
work
your
land
with
hired
laborers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
all
peasants
together
.
We
go
into
everything
ourselves
.
If
a
*NL*
man
's
no
use
,
he
can
go
,
and
we
can
manage
by
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
Finogen
wants
some
tar
,
''
said
the
young
woman
in
the
clogs
,
*NL*
coming
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
how
it
is
,
sir
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
getting
up
,
and
*NL*
crossing
himself
deliberately
,
he
thanked
Levin
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
went
into
the
kitchen
to
call
his
coachman
he
saw
the
whole
*NL*
family
at
dinner
.
The
women
were
standing
up
waiting
on
them
.
The
young
,
*NL*
sturdy-looking
son
was
telling
something
funny
with
his
mouth
full
of
*NL*
pudding
,
and
they
were
all
laughing
,
the
woman
in
the
clogs
,
who
was
*NL*
pouring
cabbage
soup
into
a
bowl
,
laughing
most
merrily
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
probably
the
good-looking
face
of
the
young
woman
in
the
clogs
had
*NL*
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
impression
of
well-being
this
peasant
*NL*
household
made
upon
Levin
,
but
the
impression
was
so
strong
that
Levin
*NL*
could
never
get
rid
of
it
.
And
all
the
way
from
the
old
peasant
's
to
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
he
kept
recalling
this
peasant
farm
as
though
there
were
*NL*
something
in
this
impression
that
demanded
his
special
attention
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
was
the
marshal
of
his
district
.
He
was
five
years
older
than
*NL*
Levin
,
and
had
long
been
married
.
His
sister-in-law
,
a
young
girl
Levin
*NL*
liked
very
much
,
lived
in
his
house
;
and
Levin
knew
that
Sviazhsky
and
*NL*
his
wife
would
have
greatly
liked
to
marry
the
girl
to
him
.
He
knew
this
*NL*
with
certainty
,
as
so-called
eligible
young
men
always
know
it
,
though
*NL*
he
could
never
have
brought
himself
to
speak
of
it
to
anyone
;
and
he
*NL*
knew
too
that
,
although
he
wanted
to
get
married
,
and
although
by
every
*NL*
token
this
very
attractive
girl
would
make
an
excellent
wife
,
he
could
*NL*
no
more
have
married
her
,
even
if
he
had
not
been
in
love
with
Kitty
*NL*
Shtcherbatskaya
,
than
he
could
have
flown
up
to
the
sky
.
And
this
*NL*
knowledge
poisoned
the
pleasure
he
had
hoped
to
find
in
the
visit
to
*NL*
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
getting
Sviazhsky
's
letter
with
the
invitation
for
shooting
,
Levin
*NL*
had
immediately
thought
of
this
;
but
in
spite
of
it
he
had
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
that
Sviazhsky
's
having
such
views
for
him
was
simply
his
own
*NL*
groundless
supposition
,
and
so
he
would
go
,
all
the
same
.
Besides
,
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
a
desire
to
try
himself
,
put
himself
to
*NL*
the
test
in
regard
to
this
girl
.
The
Sviazhskys
'
home-life
was
*NL*
exceedingly
pleasant
,
and
Sviazhsky
himself
,
the
best
type
of
man
taking
*NL*
part
in
local
affairs
that
Levin
knew
,
was
very
interesting
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
was
one
of
those
people
,
always
a
source
of
wonder
to
Levin
,
*NL*
whose
convictions
,
very
logical
though
never
original
,
go
one
way
by
*NL*
themselves
,
while
their
life
,
exceedingly
definite
and
firm
in
its
*NL*
direction
,
goes
its
way
quite
apart
and
almost
always
in
direct
*NL*
contradiction
to
their
convictions
.
Sviazhsky
was
an
extremely
advanced
*NL*
man
.
He
despised
the
nobility
,
and
believed
the
mass
of
the
nobility
to
*NL*
be
secretly
in
favor
of
serfdom
,
and
only
concealing
their
views
from
*NL*
cowardice
.
He
regarded
Russia
as
a
ruined
country
,
rather
after
the
*NL*
style
of
Turkey
,
and
the
government
of
Russia
as
so
bad
that
he
never
*NL*
permitted
himself
to
criticize
its
doings
seriously
,
and
yet
he
was
a
*NL*
functionary
of
that
government
and
a
model
marshal
of
nobility
,
and
when
*NL*
he
drove
about
he
always
wore
the
cockade
of
office
and
the
cap
with
the
*NL*
red
band
.
He
considered
human
life
only
tolerable
abroad
,
and
went
*NL*
abroad
to
stay
at
every
opportunity
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
carried
on
*NL*
a
complex
and
improved
system
of
agriculture
in
Russia
,
and
with
extreme
*NL*
interest
followed
everything
and
knew
everything
that
was
being
done
in
*NL*
Russia
.
He
considered
the
Russian
peasant
as
occupying
a
stage
of
*NL*
development
intermediate
between
the
ape
and
the
man
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
in
the
local
assemblies
no
one
was
readier
to
shake
hands
with
the
*NL*
peasants
and
listen
to
their
opinion
.
He
believed
neither
in
God
nor
the
*NL*
devil
,
but
was
much
concerned
about
the
question
of
the
improvement
of
*NL*
the
clergy
and
the
maintenance
of
their
revenues
,
and
took
special
*NL*
trouble
to
keep
up
the
church
in
his
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
woman
question
he
was
on
the
side
of
the
extreme
advocates
of
*NL*
complete
liberty
for
women
,
and
especially
their
right
to
labor
.
But
he
*NL*
lived
with
his
wife
on
such
terms
that
their
affectionate
childless
home
*NL*
life
was
the
admiration
of
everyone
,
and
arranged
his
wife
's
life
so
*NL*
that
she
did
nothing
and
could
do
nothing
but
share
her
husband
's
*NL*
efforts
that
her
time
should
pass
as
happily
and
as
agreeably
as
*NL*
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
not
been
a
characteristic
of
Levin
's
to
put
the
most
favorable
*NL*
interpretation
on
people
,
Sviazhsky
's
character
would
have
presented
no
*NL*
doubt
or
difficulty
to
him
:
he
would
have
said
to
himself
,
``
a
fool
or
a
*NL*
knave
,
''
and
everything
would
have
seemed
clear
.
But
he
could
not
say
``
a
*NL*
fool
,
''
because
Sviazhsky
was
unmistakably
clever
,
and
moreover
,
a
highly
*NL*
cultivated
man
,
who
was
exceptionally
modest
over
his
culture
.
There
was
*NL*
not
a
subject
he
knew
nothing
of
.
But
he
did
not
display
his
knowledge
*NL*
except
when
he
was
compelled
to
do
so
.
Still
less
could
Levin
say
that
*NL*
he
was
a
knave
,
as
Sviazhsky
was
unmistakably
an
honest
,
good-hearted
,
*NL*
sensible
man
,
who
worked
good-humoredly
,
keenly
,
and
perseveringly
at
*NL*
his
work
;
he
was
held
in
high
honor
by
everyone
about
him
,
and
certainly
*NL*
he
had
never
consciously
done
,
and
was
indeed
incapable
of
doing
,
*NL*
anything
base
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
tried
to
understand
him
,
and
could
not
understand
him
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
him
and
his
life
as
at
a
living
enigma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
and
he
were
very
friendly
,
and
so
Levin
used
to
venture
to
sound
*NL*
Sviazhsky
,
to
try
to
get
at
the
very
foundation
of
his
view
of
life
;
but
*NL*
it
was
always
in
vain
.
Every
time
Levin
tried
to
penetrate
beyond
the
*NL*
outer
chambers
of
Sviazhsky
's
mind
,
which
were
hospitably
open
to
all
,
*NL*
he
noticed
that
Sviazhsky
was
slightly
disconcerted
;
faint
signs
of
*NL*
alarm
were
visible
in
his
eyes
,
as
though
he
were
afraid
Levin
would
*NL*
understand
him
,
and
he
would
give
him
a
kindly
,
good-humored
repulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
now
,
since
his
disenchantment
with
farming
,
Levin
was
particularly
*NL*
glad
to
stay
with
Sviazhsky
.
Apart
from
the
fact
that
the
sight
of
this
*NL*
happy
and
affectionate
couple
,
so
pleased
with
themselves
and
everyone
*NL*
else
,
and
their
well-ordered
home
had
always
a
cheering
effect
on
Levin
,
*NL*
he
felt
a
longing
,
now
that
he
was
so
dissatisfied
with
his
own
life
,
to
*NL*
get
at
that
secret
in
Sviazhsky
that
gave
him
such
clearness
,
*NL*
definiteness
,
and
good
courage
in
life
.
Moreover
,
Levin
knew
that
at
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
he
should
meet
the
landowners
of
the
neighborhood
,
and
it
*NL*
was
particularly
interesting
for
him
just
now
to
hear
and
take
part
in
*NL*
those
rural
conversations
concerning
crops
,
laborers
'
wages
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
which
,
he
was
aware
,
are
conventionally
regarded
as
something
very
low
,
*NL*
but
which
seemed
to
him
just
now
to
constitute
the
one
subject
of
*NL*
importance
.
``
It
was
not
,
perhaps
,
of
importance
in
the
days
of
serfdom
,
*NL*
and
it
may
not
be
of
importance
in
England
.
In
both
cases
the
conditions
*NL*
of
agriculture
are
firmly
established
;
but
among
us
now
,
when
everything
*NL*
has
been
turned
upside
down
and
is
only
just
taking
shape
,
the
question
*NL*
what
form
these
conditions
will
take
is
the
one
question
of
importance
*NL*
in
Russia
,
''
thought
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shooting
turned
out
to
be
worse
than
Levin
had
expected
.
The
marsh
*NL*
was
dry
and
there
were
no
grouse
at
all
.
He
walked
about
the
whole
day
*NL*
and
only
brought
back
three
birds
,
but
to
make
up
for
that
--
he
brought
*NL*
back
,
as
he
always
did
from
shooting
,
an
excellent
appetite
,
excellent
*NL*
spirits
,
and
that
keen
,
intellectual
mood
which
with
him
always
*NL*
accompanied
violent
physical
exertion
.
And
while
out
shooting
,
when
he
*NL*
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
,
suddenly
the
old
man
and
his
*NL*
family
kept
coming
back
to
his
mind
,
and
the
impression
of
them
seemed
*NL*
to
claim
not
merely
his
attention
,
but
the
solution
of
some
question
*NL*
connected
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
at
tea
,
two
landowners
who
had
come
about
some
business
*NL*
connected
with
a
wardship
were
of
the
party
,
and
the
interesting
*NL*
conversation
Levin
had
been
looking
forward
to
sprang
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
sitting
beside
his
hostess
at
the
tea
table
,
and
was
obliged
*NL*
to
keep
up
a
conversation
with
her
and
her
sister
,
who
was
sitting
*NL*
opposite
him
.
Madame
Sviazhskaya
was
a
round-faced
,
fair-haired
,
rather
*NL*
short
woman
,
all
smiles
and
dimples
.
Levin
tried
through
her
to
get
a
*NL*
solution
of
the
weighty
enigma
her
husband
presented
to
his
mind
;
but
he
*NL*
had
not
complete
freedom
of
ideas
,
because
he
was
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
embarrassment
.
This
agony
of
embarrassment
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
sister-in-law
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
,
in
a
dress
,
specially
put
on
,
*NL*
as
he
fancied
,
for
his
benefit
,
cut
particularly
open
,
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
trapeze
,
on
her
white
bosom
.
This
quadrangular
opening
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
bosom
's
being
very
white
,
or
just
because
it
was
very
white
,
deprived
*NL*
Levin
of
the
full
use
of
his
faculties
.
He
imagined
,
probably
*NL*
mistakenly
,
that
this
low-necked
bodice
had
been
made
on
his
account
,
*NL*
and
felt
that
he
had
no
right
to
look
at
it
,
and
tried
not
to
look
at
*NL*
it
;
but
he
felt
that
he
was
to
blame
for
the
very
fact
of
the
low-necked
*NL*
bodice
having
been
made
.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
he
had
deceived
*NL*
someone
,
that
he
ought
to
explain
something
,
but
that
to
explain
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
and
for
that
reason
he
was
continually
blushing
,
was
ill
at
*NL*
ease
and
awkward
.
His
awkwardness
infected
the
pretty
sister-in-law
too
.
*NL*
But
their
hostess
appeared
not
to
observe
this
,
and
kept
purposely
*NL*
drawing
her
into
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
,
''
she
said
,
pursuing
the
subject
that
had
been
started
,
``
that
*NL*
my
husband
can
not
be
interested
in
what
's
Russian
.
It
's
quite
the
*NL*
contrary
;
he
is
always
in
cheerful
spirits
abroad
,
but
not
as
he
is
*NL*
here
.
Here
,
he
feels
in
his
proper
place
.
He
has
so
much
to
do
,
and
he
*NL*
has
the
faculty
of
interesting
himself
in
everything
.
Oh
,
you
've
not
*NL*
been
to
see
our
school
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
it
...
The
little
house
covered
with
ivy
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
Nastia
's
work
,
''
she
said
,
indicating
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
teach
in
it
yourself
?
''
asked
Levin
,
trying
to
look
above
the
open
*NL*
neck
,
but
feeling
that
wherever
he
looked
in
that
direction
he
should
*NL*
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
used
to
teach
in
it
myself
,
and
do
teach
still
,
but
we
have
a
*NL*
first-rate
schoolmistress
now
.
And
we
've
started
gymnastic
exercises
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
I
wo
n't
have
any
more
tea
,
''
said
Levin
,
and
conscious
of
*NL*
doing
a
rude
thing
,
but
incapable
of
continuing
the
conversation
,
he
got
*NL*
up
,
blushing
.
``
I
hear
a
very
interesting
conversation
,
''
he
added
,
and
*NL*
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
where
Sviazhsky
was
sitting
with
*NL*
the
two
gentlemen
of
the
neighborhood
.
Sviazhsky
was
sitting
sideways
,
*NL*
with
one
elbow
on
the
table
,
and
a
cup
in
one
hand
,
while
with
the
other
*NL*
hand
he
gathered
up
his
beard
,
held
it
to
his
nose
and
let
it
drop
*NL*
again
,
as
though
he
were
smelling
it
.
His
brilliant
black
eyes
were
*NL*
looking
straight
at
the
excited
country
gentleman
with
gray
whiskers
,
*NL*
and
apparently
he
derived
amusement
from
his
remarks
.
The
gentleman
was
*NL*
complaining
of
the
peasants
.
It
was
evident
to
Levin
that
Sviazhsky
knew
*NL*
an
answer
to
this
gentleman
's
complaints
,
which
would
at
once
demolish
*NL*
his
whole
contention
,
but
that
in
his
position
he
could
not
give
*NL*
utterance
to
this
answer
,
and
listened
,
not
without
pleasure
,
to
the
*NL*
landowner
's
comic
speeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
with
the
gray
whiskers
was
obviously
an
inveterate
*NL*
adherent
of
serfdom
and
a
devoted
agriculturist
,
who
had
lived
all
his
*NL*
life
in
the
country
.
Levin
saw
proofs
of
this
in
his
dress
,
in
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
threadbare
coat
,
obviously
not
his
everyday
attire
,
in
his
*NL*
shrewd
,
deep-set
eyes
,
in
his
idiomatic
,
fluent
Russian
,
in
the
*NL*
imperious
tone
that
had
become
habitual
from
long
use
,
and
in
the
*NL*
resolute
gestures
of
his
large
,
red
,
sunburnt
hands
,
with
an
old
*NL*
betrothal
ring
on
the
little
finger
.

``
If
I
'd
only
the
heart
to
throw
up
what
's
been
set
going
...
such
a
lot
*NL*
of
trouble
wasted
...
I
'd
turn
my
back
on
the
whole
business
,
sell
up
,
*NL*
go
off
like
Nikolay
Ivanovitch
...
to
hear
_
La
Belle
Helene
_
,
''
said
the
*NL*
landowner
,
a
pleasant
smile
lighting
up
his
shrewd
old
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
see
you
do
n't
throw
it
up
,
''
said
Nikolay
Ivanovitch
Sviazhsky
;
*NL*
``
so
there
must
be
something
gained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
gain
is
that
I
live
in
my
own
house
,
neither
bought
nor
hired
.
*NL*
Besides
,
one
keeps
hoping
the
people
will
learn
sense
.
Though
,
instead
*NL*
of
that
,
you
'd
never
believe
it
--
the
drunkenness
,
the
immorality
!
They
*NL*
keep
chopping
and
changing
their
bits
of
land
.
Not
a
sight
of
a
horse
or
*NL*
a
cow
.
The
peasant
's
dying
of
hunger
,
but
just
go
and
take
him
on
as
a
*NL*
laborer
,
he
'll
do
his
best
to
do
you
a
mischief
,
and
then
bring
you
up
*NL*
before
the
justice
of
the
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
you
make
complaints
to
the
justice
too
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lodge
complaints
?
Not
for
anything
in
the
world
!
Such
a
talking
,
and
*NL*
such
a
to-do
,
that
one
would
have
cause
to
regret
it
.
At
the
works
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
they
pocketed
the
advance-money
and
made
off
.
What
did
the
*NL*
justice
do
?
Why
,
acquitted
them
.
Nothing
keeps
them
in
order
but
their
*NL*
own
communal
court
and
their
village
elder
.
He
'll
flog
them
in
the
good
*NL*
old
style
!
But
for
that
there
'd
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
give
it
all
up
*NL*
and
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Obviously
the
landowner
was
chaffing
Sviazhsky
,
who
,
far
from
resenting
*NL*
it
,
was
apparently
amused
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
see
we
manage
our
land
without
such
extreme
measures
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
smiling
:
``
Levin
and
I
and
this
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
indicated
the
other
landowner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
thing
's
done
at
Mihail
Petrovitch
's
,
but
ask
him
how
it
's
*NL*
done
.
Do
you
call
that
a
rational
system
?
''
said
the
landowner
,
obviously
*NL*
rather
proud
of
the
word
``
rational
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
system
's
very
simple
,
''
said
Mihail
Petrovitch
,
``
thank
God
.
All
my
*NL*
management
rests
on
getting
the
money
ready
for
the
autumn
taxes

*NL*
the
peasants
come
to
me
,
`
Father

master

help
us
!
'
Well
,
the
peasants
*NL*
are
all
one
's
neighbors
;
one
feels
for
them
.
So
one
advances
them
a
*NL*
third
,
but
one
says
:
`
Remember
,
lads

I
have
helped
you

and
you
must
*NL*
help
me

I

whether
it
's
the
sowing
of
the
oats
,
or
the
*NL*
haycutting
,
or
the
harvest

;
and
well
,
one
agrees
,
so
much
for
each
*NL*
taxpayer
--
though
there
are
dishonest
ones
among
them
too
,
it
's
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
who
had
long
been
familiar
with
these
patriarchal
methods
,
*NL*
exchanged
glances
with
Sviazhsky
and
interrupted
Mihail
Petrovitch
,
*NL*
turning
again
to
the
gentleman
with
the
gray
whiskers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
do
you
think
?
''
he
asked
;
``
what
system
is
one
to
adopt
*NL*
nowadays
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
manage
like
Mihail
Petrovitch
,
or
let
the
land
for
half
the
crop
*NL*
or
for
rent
to
the
peasants
;
that
one
can
do
--
only
that
's
just
how
the
*NL*
general
prosperity
of
the
country
is
being
ruined
.
Where
the
land
with
*NL*
serf-labor
and
good
management
gave
a
yield
of
nine
to
one
,
on
the
*NL*
half-crop
system
it
yields
three
to
one
.
Russia
has
been
ruined
by
the
*NL*
emancipation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
looked
with
smiling
eyes
at
Levin
,
and
even
made
a
faint
*NL*
gesture
of
irony
to
him
;
but
Levin
did
not
think
the
landowner
's
words
*NL*
absurd
,
he
understood
them
better
than
he
did
Sviazhsky
.
A
great
deal
*NL*
more
of
what
the
gentleman
with
the
gray
whiskers
said
to
show
in
what
*NL*
way
Russia
was
ruined
by
the
emancipation
struck
him
indeed
as
very
*NL*
true
,
new
to
him
,
and
quite
incontestable
.
The
landowner
unmistakably
*NL*
spoke
his
own
individual
thought
--
a
thing
that
very
rarely
happens
--
and
*NL*
a
thought
to
which
he
had
been
brought
not
by
a
desire
of
finding
some
*NL*
exercise
for
an
idle
brain
,
but
a
thought
which
had
grown
up
out
of
the
*NL*
conditions
of
his
life
,
which
he
had
brooded
over
in
the
solitude
of
his
*NL*
village
,
and
had
considered
in
every
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
point
is
,
do
n't
you
see
,
that
progress
of
every
sort
is
only
made
*NL*
by
the
use
of
authority
,
''
he
said
,
evidently
wishing
to
show
he
was
not
*NL*
without
culture
.
``
Take
the
reforms
of
Peter
,
of
Catherine
,
of
Alexander
.
*NL*
Take
European
history
.
And
progress
in
agriculture
more
than
anything
*NL*
else
--
the
potato
,
for
instance
,
that
was
introduced
among
us
by
force
.
*NL*
The
wooden
plough
too
was
n't
always
used
.
It
was
introduced
maybe
in
the
*NL*
days
before
the
Empire
,
but
it
was
probably
brought
in
by
force
.
Now
,
in
*NL*
our
own
day
,
we
landowners
in
the
serf
times
used
various
improvements
*NL*
in
our
husbandry
:
drying
machines
and
thrashing
machines
,
and
carting
*NL*
manure
and
all
the
modern
implements
--
all
that
we
brought
into
use
by
*NL*
our
authority
,
and
the
peasants
opposed
it
at
first
,
and
ended
by
*NL*
imitating
us
.
Now
,
by
the
abolition
of
serfdom
we
have
been
deprived
of
*NL*
our
authority
;
and
so
our
husbandry
,
where
it
had
been
raised
to
a
high
*NL*
level
,
is
bound
to
sink
to
the
most
savage
primitive
condition
.
That
's
*NL*
how
I
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
so
?
If
it
's
rational
,
you
'll
be
able
to
keep
up
the
same
system
*NL*
with
hired
labor
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
no
power
over
them
.
With
whom
am
I
going
to
work
the
system
,
*NL*
allow
me
to
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
--
the
labor
force
--
the
chief
element
in
agriculture
,
''
*NL*
thought
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
laborers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
laborers
wo
n't
work
well
,
and
wo
n't
work
with
good
implements
.
Our
*NL*
laborer
can
do
nothing
but
get
drunk
like
a
pig
,
and
when
he
's
drunk
he
*NL*
ruins
everything
you
give
him
.
He
makes
the
horses
ill
with
too
much
*NL*
water
,
cuts
good
harness
,
barters
the
tires
of
the
wheels
for
drink
,
*NL*
drops
bits
of
iron
into
the
thrashing
machine
,
so
as
to
break
it
.
He
*NL*
loathes
the
sight
of
anything
that
's
not
after
his
fashion
.
And
that
's
*NL*
how
it
is
the
whole
level
of
husbandry
has
fallen
.
Lands
gone
out
of
*NL*
cultivation
,
overgrown
with
weeds
,
or
divided
among
the
peasants
,
and
*NL*
where
millions
of
bushels
were
raised
you
get
a
hundred
thousand
;
the
*NL*
wealth
of
the
country
has
decreased
.
If
the
same
thing
had
been
done
,
*NL*
but
with
care
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
proceeded
to
unfold
his
own
scheme
of
emancipation
by
means
of
*NL*
which
these
drawbacks
might
have
been
avoided
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
interest
Levin
,
but
when
he
had
finished
,
Levin
went
back
*NL*
to
his
first
position
,
and
,
addressing
Sviazhsky
,
and
trying
to
draw
him
*NL*
into
expressing
his
serious
opinion
:
-
`
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
the
standard
of
culture
is
falling
,
and
that
with
our
present
*NL*
relations
to
the
peasants
there
is
no
possibility
of
farming
on
a
*NL*
rational
system
to
yield
a
profit
--
that
's
perfectly
true
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
''
Sviazhsky
replied
quite
seriously
;
``
all
I
see
is
*NL*
that
we
do
n't
know
how
to
cultivate
the
land
,
and
that
our
system
of
*NL*
agriculture
in
the
serf
days
was
by
no
means
too
high
,
but
too
low
.
We
*NL*
have
no
machines
,
no
good
stock
,
no
efficient
supervision
;
we
do
n't
even
*NL*
know
how

Ask
any

you
what

's
profitable

and
what

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
gentleman
of
the
gray
whiskers
*NL*
ironically
.
``
You

chimed
in

positively
laughing
with
satisfaction

*NL*
``

Levin

''
said
Levin
,
and
at
once
in
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
eyes
he
detected
that
fleeting
expression
of
alarm
which
he
*NL*
had
noticed
whenever
he
had
tried
to
penetrate
beyond
the
outer
chambers
*NL*
of
Sviazhsky
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
this
question
on
Levin
's
part
was
not
quite
in
good
faith
.
*NL*
Madame
Sviazhskaya
had
just
told
him
at
tea
that
they
had
that
summer
*NL*
invited
a
German
expert
in
bookkeeping
from
Moscow
,
who
for
a
*NL*
consideration
of
five
hundred
roubles
had
investigated
the
management
of
*NL*
their
property
,
and
found
that
it
was
costing
them
a
loss
of
three
*NL*
thousand
odd
roubles
.
She
did
not
remember
the
precise
sum
,
but
it
*NL*
appeared
that
the
German
had
worked
it
out
to
the
fraction
of
a
*NL*
farthing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gray-whiskered
landowner
smiled
at
the
mention
of
the
profits
of
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
famling
,
obviously
aware
how
much
gain
his
neighbor
and
*NL*
marshal
was
likely
to
be
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
it
does
not
pay
,
''
answered
Sviazhsky
.
``
That
merely
proves
*NL*
either
that
I
'm
a
bad
manager
,
or
that
I
've
sunk
my
capital
for
the
*NL*
increase
of
my
rents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
rent
!

Levin
cried
with
horror
.
``
Rent
there
may
be
in
Europe
,
where
*NL*
land
has
been
improved
by
the
labor
put
into
it

with
us
all
the
*NL*
land
is
deteriorating
from
the
labor
put
into
it

in
other
words
they
're
*NL*
working
it
out

so
there
's
no
question

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
no

It
's
a

*NL*
``
Will
you

Masha
,
pass
us
some
junket
or
raspberries

''
*NL*
He
turned
to
his
wife
.
``
Extraordinarily
late
the
raspberries
are
lasting
*NL*
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
Sviazhsky
got
up
and
walked
off
,
*NL*
apparently
supposing
the
conversation
to
have
ended
at
the
very
point
*NL*
when
to
Levin
it
seemed
that
it
was
only
just
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
lost
his
antagonist
,
Levin
continued
the
conversation
with
the
*NL*
gray-whiskered
landowner
,
trying
to
prove
to
him
that
all
the
difficulty
*NL*
arises
from
the
fact
that
we
do
n't
find
out
the
peculiarities
and
habits
*NL*
of
our
laborer
;
but
the
landowner
,
like
all
men
who
think
independently
*NL*
and
in
isolation
,
was
slow
in
taking
in
any
other
person
's
idea
,
and
*NL*
particularly
partial
to
his
own
.
He
stuck
to
it
that
the
Russian
peasant
*NL*
is
a
swine
and
likes
swinishness
,
and
that
to
get
him
out
of
his
*NL*
swinishness
one
must
have
authority
,
and
there
is
none
;
one
must
have
*NL*
the
stick
,
and
we
have
become
so
liberal
that
we
have
all
of
a
sudden
*NL*
replaced
the
stick
that
served
us
for
a
thousand
years
by
lawyers
and
*NL*
model
prisons
,
where
the
worthless
,
stinking
peasant
is
fed
on
good
soup
*NL*
and
has
a
fixed
allowance
of
cubic
feet
of
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
,
''
said
Levin
,
trying
to
get
back
to
the
question
,
*NL*
``
that
it
's
impossible
to
find
some
relation
to
the
laborer
in
which
the
*NL*
labor
would
become
productive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
never
could
be
so
with
the
Russian
peasantry
;
we
've
no
power
over
*NL*
them
,
''
answered
the
landowner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
new
conditions
be
found
?
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
Having
eaten
some
*NL*
junket
and
lighted
a
cigarette
,
he
came
back
to
the
discussion
.
``
All
*NL*
possible
relations
to
the
labor
force
have
been
defined
and
studied
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
The
relic
of
barbarism
,
the
primitive
commune
with
each
guarantee
*NL*
for
all
,
will
disappear
of
itself
;
serfdom
has
been
abolished
--
there
*NL*
remains
nothing
but
free
labor
,
and
its
forms
are
fixed
and
ready
made
,
*NL*
and
must
be
adopted
.
Permanent
hands
,
day-laborers
,
rammers
--
you
ca
n't
*NL*
get
out
of
those
forms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Europe
is
dissatisfied
with
these
forms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dissatisfied
,
and
seeking
new
ones
.
And
will
find
them
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
was
meaning
,
''
answered
Levin
.
``
Why
should
n't
we
seek
*NL*
them
for
ourselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
would
be
just
like
inventing
afresh
the
means
for
*NL*
constructing
railways
.
They
are
ready
,
invented

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
they
do
n't
do
for
us
,
if
they
're
stupid
?
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
detected
the
expression
of
alarm
in
the
eyes
of
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
we
'll
bury
the
world
under
our
caps

We
've
found
the
secret
*NL*
Europe
was
seeking
for
!
I
've
heard
all
that
;
but
,
excuse
me
,
do
you
know
*NL*
all
that
's
been
done
in
Europe
on
the
question

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

very
little

*NL*
*NL*

question
is
now
absorbing
the
best

enormous
literature
of

the
labor
question

the
most
liberal
Lassalle
movement

the
Mulhausen

experiment

That
's
a
fact
by
now
,
as
you
're
probably
aware

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
some
idea
of
it

very
vague

*NL*
``

not

*NL*
*NL*
The
two
neighbors
had
risen
,
and
Sviazhsky
,
once
more
checking
Levin
in
*NL*
his
inconvenient
habit
of
peeping
into
what
was
beyond
the
outer
*NL*
chambers
of
his
mind
,
went
to
see

out

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
insufferably
bored
that
evening
with
the
ladies
;
he
was
*NL*
stirred
as
he
had
never
been
before
by
the
idea
that
the
dissatisfaction
*NL*
he
was
feeling
with
his
system
of
managing
his
land
was
not
an
*NL*
exceptional
case
,
but
the
general
condition
of
things
in
Russia
;
that
*NL*
the
organization
of
some
relation
of
the
laborers
to
the
soil
in
which
*NL*
they
would
work
,
as
with
the
peasant
he
had
met
half-way
to
the
*NL*
Sviazhskys
'
,
was
not
a
dream
,
but
a
problem
which
must
be
solved
.
And
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
the
problem
could
be
solved
,
and
that
he
ought
to
try
*NL*
and
solve
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
saying
good-night
to
the
ladies
,
and
promising
to
stay
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
next
day
,
so
as
to
make
an
expedition
on
horseback
with
them
to
*NL*
see
an
interesting
ruin
in
the
crown
forest
,
Levin
went
,
before
going
to
*NL*
bed
,
into
his
host
's
study
to
get
the
books
on
the
labor
question
that
*NL*
Sviazhsky
had
offered
him
.
Sviazhsky
's
study
was
a
huge
room
,
surrounded
*NL*
by
bookcases
and
with
two
tables
in
it
--
one
a
massive
writing
table
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
the
other
a
round
table
,
covered
*NL*
with
recent
numbers
of
reviews
and
journals
in
different
languages
,
*NL*
ranged
like
the
rays
of
a
star
round
the
lamp
.
On
the
writing
table
was
*NL*
a
stand
of
drawers
marked
with
gold
lettering
,
and
full
of
papers
of
*NL*
various
sorts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
took
out
the
books
,
and
sat
down
in
a
rocking-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
at
there
?
''
he
said
to
Levin
,
who
was
standing
at
*NL*
the
round
table
looking
through
the
reviews
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
there
's
a
very
interesting
article
here
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
of
*NL*
the
review
Levin
was
holding
in
his
hand
.
``
It
appears
,
''
he
went
on
,
with
*NL*
eager
interest
,
``
that
Friedrich
was
not
,
after
all
,
the
person
chiefly
*NL*
responsible
for
the
partition
of
Poland
.
It
is
proved
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
his
characteristic
clearness
,
he
summed
up
those
new
,
very
*NL*
important
,
and
interesting
revelations
.
Although
Levin
was
engrossed
at
*NL*
the
moment
by
his
ideas
about
the
problem
of
the
land
,
he
wondered
,
as
*NL*
he
heard
Sviazhsky
:
``
What
is
there
inside
of
him
?
And
why
,
why
is
he
*NL*
interested
in
the
partition
of
Poland
?
''
When
Sviazhsky
had
finished
,
*NL*
Levin
could
not
help
asking
:
``
Well
,
and
what
then
?
''
But
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
follow
.
It
was
simply
interesting
that
it
had
been
proved
to
*NL*
be
so
and
so
.
But
Sviazhsky
did
not
explain
,
and
saw
no
need
to
explain
*NL*
why
it
was
interesting
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
was
very
much
interested
by
your
irritable
neighbor
,
''
said
*NL*
Levin
,
sighing
.
``
He
's
a
clever
fellow
,
and
said
a
lot
that
was
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
get
along
with
you
!
An
inveterate
supporter
of
serfdom
at
heart
,
*NL*
like
all
of
them
!

said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
marshal
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
only
I
marshal
them
in
the
other
direction
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
interests
me
very
much
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
He
's
right
*NL*
that
our
system
,
that
's
to
say
of
rational
farming
,
does
n't
answer
,
that
*NL*
the
only
thing
that
answers
is
the
money-lender
system

that
*NL*
meek-looking
gentleman

else
the
very
simplest

Whose
fault
is
*NL*
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
own
,
of
course

Besides

it
's
not
true

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
really
do

it
is

The

a
low
stage
of
rational
and
moral
development
,
that
it
's
obvious
*NL*
they
're
bound
to
oppose
everything
that
's
strange
to
them
.
In
Europe
,
a
*NL*
rational
system
answers
because

are
educated

it
follows
that

we
must
educate

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
are
we
to

*NL*

three

*NL*
``
Do
you

to

just
how
it
is
with

I

political
economy

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
schools
help
matters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
give
the
peasant
fresh
wants

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
a
thing
I
've
never
understood

Levin
replied
with
heat
.
*NL*
``
In
what
way
are
schools
going
to
help
the
people
to
improve
their
*NL*
material
position
?
You
say
schools
,
education
,
will
give
them
fresh
*NL*
wants
.
So
much
the
worse
,
since
they
wo
n't
be
capable

satisfying
*NL*
them

And
in
what
way
a
knowledge
of
addition

subtraction
and
the
*NL*
catechism
is
going
to
improve
their
material
condition
,
I
never
could
*NL*
make
out
.
The
day
before
yesterday
,
I
met
a
peasant
woman
in
the
evening
*NL*
with
a
little
baby
,
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
.
She
said
she
was
*NL*
going
to
the
wise
woman
;
her
boy
had
screaming
fits
,
so
she
was
taking
*NL*
him
to
be
doctored

I
asked
,

Why
,
how
does
the
wise
woman
cure
*NL*
screaming
fits
?

`
She
puts
the
child
on
the
hen-roost
and
repeats
some
*NL*
charm
...
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
saying
it
yourself
!
What
's
wanted
to
prevent
her
taking
*NL*
her
child
to
the
hen-roost
to
cure
it
of
screaming
fits
is
just
...
''
*NL*
Sviazhsky
said
,
smiling
good-humoredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
said
Levin
with
annoyance
;
``
that
method
of
doctoring
I
merely
*NL*
meant
as
a
simile
for
doctoring
the
people
with
schools

The
people
are
*NL*
poor
and
ignorant
--
that
we
see
as
surely
as
the
peasant
woman
sees
the
*NL*
baby
is
ill
because
it
screams
.
But
in
what
way
this
trouble
of
poverty
*NL*
and
ignorance
is
to
be
cured
by
schools
is
as
incomprehensible
as
how
*NL*
the
hen-roost
affects
the
screaming
.
What
has
to
be
cured
is
what
makes
*NL*
him
poor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
that
,
at
least
,
you
're
in
agreement
with
Spencer
,
whom
you
*NL*
dislike
so
much
.
He
says
,
too
,
that
education
may
be
the
consequence
of
*NL*
greater
prosperity
and
comfort
,
of
more
frequent
washing

he
says

not

being
able

read

write

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'm
very
glad

the
contrary

sorry
,
that

agreement
with
Spencer

only
I
've
known
it
a
long
while

Schools
can
do
*NL*
no
good
;
what
will
do
good
is
an
economic
organization
in
which
the
*NL*
people
will
become
richer
,
will
have
more
leisure

and
then
there
will

be
schools

``
Still

all

how
far
do
you
agree
with
Spencer
yourself

asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
gleam
of
alarm
in
Sviazhsky
's
eyes
,
and
he
said
smiling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
that
screaming
story
is
positively
capital
!
Did
you
really
hear
it
*NL*
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
Levin
saw
that
he
was
not
to
discover
the
connection
between
this
man
's
*NL*
life
and
his
thoughts
.
Obviously
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
what
his
*NL*
reasoning
led
him
to
;
all
he
wanted
was
the
process
of
reasoning
.
And
he
*NL*
did
not
like
it
when
the
process
of
reasoning
brought
him
into
a
blind
*NL*
alley
.
That
was
the
only
thing
he
disliked
,
and
avoided
by
changing
the
*NL*
conversation
to
something
agreeable
and
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
impressions
of
the
day
,
beginning
with
the
impression
made
by
*NL*
the
old
peasant
,
which
served
,
as
it
were
,
as
the
fundamental
basis
of
*NL*
all
the
conceptions
and
ideas
of
the
day
,
threw
Levin
into
violent
*NL*
excitement
.
This
dear
good
Sviazhsky
,
keeping
a
stock
of
ideas
simply
*NL*
for
social
purposes
,
and
obviously
having
some
other
principles
hidden
*NL*
from
Levin
,
while
with
the
crowd
,
whose
name
is
legion
,
he
guided
public
*NL*
opinion
by
ideas
he
did
not
share
;
that
irascible
country
gentleman
,
*NL*
perfectly
correct
in
the
conclusions
that
he
had
been
worried
into
by
*NL*
life
,
but
wrong
in
his
exasperation
against
a
whole
class
,
and
that
the
*NL*
best
class
in
Russia
;
his
own
dissatisfaction
with
the
work
he
had
been
*NL*
doing
,
and
the
vague
hope
of
finding
a
remedy
for
all
this
--
all
was
*NL*
blended
in
a
sense
of
inward
turmoil
,
and
anticipation
of
some
solution
*NL*
near
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
in
the
room
assigned
him
,
lying
on
a
spring
mattress
that
*NL*
yielded
unexpectedly
at
every
movement
of
his
arm
or
his
leg
,
Levin
did
*NL*
not
fall
asleep
for
a
long
while
.
Not
one
conversation
with
Sviazhsky
,
*NL*
though
he
had
said
a
great
deal
that
was
clever
,
had
interested
Levin
;
*NL*
but
the
conclusions
of
the
irascible
landowner
required
consideration
.
*NL*
Levin
could
not
help
recalling
every
word
he
had
said
,
and
in
*NL*
imagination
amending
his
own
replies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
ought
to
have
said
to
him
:
You
say
that
our
husbandry
does
not
*NL*
answer
because
the
peasant
hates
improvements
,
and
that
they
must
be
*NL*
forced
on
him
by
authority
.
If
no
system
of
husbandry
answered
at
all
*NL*
without
these
improvements
,
you
would
be
quite
right
.
But
the
only
*NL*
system
that
does
answer
is
where
laborer
is
working
in
accordance
with
*NL*
his
habits
,
just
as
on
the
old
peasant
's
land
half-way
here
.
Your
and
*NL*
our
general
dissatisfaction
with
the
system
shows
that
either
we
are
to
*NL*
blame
or
the
laborers
.
We
have
gone
our
way
--
the
European
way
--
a
long
*NL*
while
,
without
asking
ourselves
about
the
qualities
of
our
labor
force
.
*NL*
Let
us
try
to
look
upon
the
labor
force
not
as
an
abstract
force
,
but
as
*NL*
the
_
Russian
peasant
_
with
his
instincts
,
and
we
shall
arrange
our
*NL*
system
of
culture
in
accordance
with
that
.
Imagine
,
I
ought
to
have
said
*NL*
to
him
,
that
you
have
the
same
system
as
the
old
peasant
has
,
that
you
*NL*
have
found
means
of
making
your
laborers
take
an
interest
in
the
success
*NL*
of
the
work
,
and
have
found
the
happy
mean
in
the
way
of
improvements
*NL*
which
they
will
admit
,
and
you
will
,
without
exhausting
the
soil
,
get
*NL*
twice
or
three
times
the
yield
you
got
before
.
Divide
it
in
halves
,
give
*NL*
half
as
the
share
of
labor
,
the
surplus
left
you
will
be
greater
,
and
*NL*
the
share
of
labor
will
be
greater
too
.
And
to
do
this
one
must
lower
*NL*
the
standard
of
husbandry
and
interest
the
laborers
in
its
success
.
How
*NL*
to
do
this
?
--
that
's
a
matter
of
detail
;
but
undoubtedly
it
can
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
threw
Levin
into
a
great
excitement
.
He
did
not
sleep
half
the
*NL*
night
,
thinking
over
in
detail
the
putting
of
his
idea
into
practice
.
He
*NL*
had
not
intended
to
go
away
next
day
,
but
he
now
determined
to
go
home
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
.
Besides
,
the
sister-in-law
with
her
low-necked
*NL*
bodice
aroused
in
him
a
feeling
akin
to
shame
and
remorse
for
some
*NL*
utterly
base
action
.
Most
important
of
all
--
he
must
get
back
without
*NL*
delay
:
he
would
have
to
make
haste
to
put
his
new
project
to
the
*NL*
peasants
before
the
sowing
of
the
winter
wheat
,
so
that
the
sowing
might
*NL*
be
undertaken
on
a
new
basis
.
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
revolutionize
*NL*
his
whole
system
.

Chapter
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
carrying
out
of
Levin
's
plan
presented
many
difficulties
;
but
he
*NL*
struggled
on
,
doing
his
utmost
,
and
attained
a
result
which
,
though
not
*NL*
what
he
desired
,
was
enough
to
enable
him
,
without
self-deception
,
to
*NL*
believe
that
the
attempt
was
worth
the
trouble
.
One
of
the
chief
*NL*
difficulties
was
that
the
process
of
cultivating
the
land
was
in
full
*NL*
swing
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
stop
everything
and
begin
it
all
again
*NL*
from
the
beginning
,
and
the
machine
had
to
be
mended
while
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
on
the
evening
that
he
arrived
home
he
informed
the
bailiff
of
his
*NL*
plans
,
the
latter
with
visible
pleasure
agreed
with
what
he
said
so
long
*NL*
as
he
was
pointing
out
that
all
that
had
been
done
up
to
that
time
was
*NL*
stupid
and
useless
.
The
bailiff
said
that
he
had
said
so
a
long
while
*NL*
ago
,
but
no
heed
had
been
paid
him
.
But
as
for
the
proposal
made
by
*NL*
Levin
--
to
take
a
part
as
shareholder
with
his
laborers
in
each
*NL*
agricultural
undertaking
--
at
this
the
bailiff
simply
expressed
a
*NL*
profound
despondency
,
and
offered
no
definite
opinion
,
but
began
*NL*
immediately
talking
of
the
urgent
necessity
of
carrying
the
remaining
*NL*
sheaves
of
rye
the
next
day
,
and
of
sending
the
men
out
for
the
second
*NL*
ploughing
,
so
that
Levin
felt
that
this
was
not
the
time
for
discussing
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
beginning
to
talk
to
the
peasants
about
it
,
and
making
a
proposition
*NL*
to
cede
them
the
land
on
new
terms
,
he
came
into
collision
with
the
same
*NL*
great
difficulty
that
they
were
so
much
absorbed
by
the
current
work
of
*NL*
the
day
,
that
they
had
not
time
to
consider
the
advantages
and
*NL*
disadvantages
of
the
proposed
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
simple-hearted
Ivan
,
the
cowherd
,
seemed
completely
to
grasp
Levin
's
*NL*
proposal
--
that
he
should
with
his
family
take
a
share
of
the
profits
of
*NL*
the
cattle-yard
--
and
he
was
in
complete
sympathy
with
the
plan
.
But
when
*NL*
Levin
hinted
at
the
future
advantages
,
Ivan
's
face
expressed
alarm
and
*NL*
regret
that
he
could
not
hear
all
he
had
to
say
,
and
he
made
haste
to
*NL*
find
himself
some
task
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
:
he
either
snatched
*NL*
up
the
fork
to
pitch
the
hay
out
of
the
pens
,
or
ran
to
get
water
or
to
*NL*
clear
out
the
dung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
difficulty
lay
in
the
invincible
disbelief
of
the
peasant
that
a
*NL*
landowner
's
object
could
be
anything
else
than
a
desire
to
squeeze
all
*NL*
he
could
out
of
them
.
They
were
firmly
convinced
that
his
real
aim
*NL*
-LRB-
whatever
he
might
say
to
them
-RRB-
would
always
be
in
what
he
did
not
say
*NL*
to
them
.
And
they
themselves
,
in
giving
their
opinion
,
said
a
great
deal
*NL*
but
never
said
what
was
their
real
object
.
Moreover
-LRB-
Levin
felt
that
the
*NL*
irascible
landowner
had
been
right
-RRB-
the
peasants
made
their
first
and
*NL*
unalterable
condition
of
any
agreement
whatever
that
they
should
not
be
*NL*
forced
to
any
new
methods
of
tillage
of
any
kind
,
nor
to
use
new
*NL*
implements
.
They
agreed
that
the
modern
plough
ploughed
better
,
that
the
*NL*
scarifier
did
the
work
more
quickly
,
but
they
found
thousands
of
reasons
*NL*
that
made
it
out
of
the
question
for
them
to
use
either
of
them
;
and
*NL*
though
he
had
accepted
the
conviction
that
he
would
have
to
lower
the
*NL*
standard
of
cultivation
,
he
felt
sorry
to
give
up
improved
methods
,
the
*NL*
advantages
of
which
were
so
obvious
.
But
in
spite
of
all
these
*NL*
difficulties
he
got
his
way
,
and
by
autumn
the
system
was
working
,
or
at
*NL*
least
so
it
seemed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Levin
had
thought
of
giving
up
the
whole
farming
of
the
land
*NL*
just
as
it
was
to
the
peasants
,
the
laborers
,
and
the
bailiff
on
new
*NL*
conditions
of
partnership
;
but
he
was
very
soon
convinced
that
this
was
*NL*
impossible
,
and
determined
to
divide
it
up
.
The
cattle-yard
,
the
garden
,
*NL*
hay
fields
,
and
arable
land
,
divided
into
several
parts
,
had
to
be
made
*NL*
into
separate
lots
.
The
simple-hearted
cowherd
,
Ivan
,
who
,
Levin
*NL*
fancied
,
understood
the
matter
better
than
any
of
them
,
collecting
*NL*
together
a
gang
of
workers
to
help
him
,
principally
of
his
own
family
,
*NL*
became
a
partner
in
the
cattle-yard
.
A
distant
part
of
the
estate
,
a
*NL*
tract
of
waste
land
that
had
lain
fallow
for
eight
years
,
was
with
the
*NL*
help
of
the
clever
carpenter
,
Fyodor
Ryezunov
,
taken
by
six
families
of
*NL*
peasants
on
new
conditions
of
partnership
,
and
the
peasant
Shuraev
took
*NL*
the
management
of
all
the
vegetable
gardens
on
the
same
terms
.
The
*NL*
remainder
of
the
land
was
still
worked
on
the
old
system
,
but
these
*NL*
three
associated
partnerships
were
the
first
step
to
a
new
organization
*NL*
of
the
whole
,
and
they
completely
took
up
Levin
's
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
in
the
cattle-yard
things
went
no
better
than
before
,
*NL*
and
Ivan
strenuously
opposed
warm
housing
for
the
cows
and
butter
made
*NL*
of
fresh
cream
,
affirming
that
cows
require
less
food
if
kept
cold
,
and
*NL*
that
butter
is
more
profitable
made
from
sour
cream
,
and
he
asked
for
*NL*
wages
just
as
under
the
old
system
,
and
took
not
the
slightest
interest
*NL*
in
the
fact
that
the
money
he
received
was
not
wages
but
an
advance
out
*NL*
of
his
future
share
in
the
profits
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
Fyodor
Ryezunov
's
company
did
not
plough
over
the
ground
*NL*
twice
before
sowing
,
as
had
been
agreed
,
justifying
themselves
on
the
*NL*
plea
that
the
time
was
too
short
.
It
is
true
that
the
peasants
of
the
*NL*
same
company
,
though
they
had
agreed
to
work
the
land
on
new
conditions
,
*NL*
always
spoke
of
the
land
,
not
as
held
in
partnership
,
but
as
rented
for
*NL*
half
the
crop
,
and
more
than
once
the
peasants
and
Ryezunov
himself
said
*NL*
to
Levin
,
``
If
you
would
take
a
rent
for
the
land
,
it
would
save
you
*NL*
trouble
,
and
we
should
be
more
free
.
''
Moreover
the
same
peasants
kept
*NL*
putting
off
,
on
various
excuses
,
the
building
of
a
cattleyard
and
barn
*NL*
on
the
land
as
agreed
upon
,
and
delayed
doing
it
till
the
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
Shuraev
would
have
liked
to
let
out
the
kitchen
gardens
*NL*
he
had
undertaken
in
small
lots
to
the
peasants
.
He
evidently
quite
*NL*
misunderstood
,
and
apparently
intentionally
misunderstood
,
the
*NL*
conditions
upon
which
the
land
had
been
given
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
too
,
talking
to
the
peasants
and
explaining
to
them
all
the
*NL*
advantages
of
the
plan
,
Levin
felt
that
the
peasants
heard
nothing
but
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
and
were
firmly
resolved
,
whatever
he
might
say
,
*NL*
not
to
let
themselves
be
taken
in
.
He
felt
this
especially
when
he
*NL*
talked
to
the
cleverest
of
the
peasants
,
Ryezunov
,
and
detected
the
*NL*
gleam
in
Ryezunov
's
eyes
which
showed
so
plainly
both
ironical
amusement
*NL*
at
Levin
,
and
the
firm
conviction
that
,
if
any
one
were
to
be
taken
in
,
*NL*
it
would
not
be
he
,
Ryezunov
.
But
in
spite
of
all
this
Levin
thought
the
*NL*
system
worked
,
and
that
by
keeping
accounts
strictly
and
insisting
on
*NL*
his
own
way
,
he
would
prove
to
them
in
the
future
the
advantages
of
the
*NL*
arrangement
,
and
then
the
system
would
go
of
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
matters
,
together
with
the
management
of
the
land
still
left
on
*NL*
his
hands
,
and
the
indoor
work
over
his
book
,
so
engrossed
Levin
the
*NL*
whole
summer
that
he
scarcely
ever
went
out
shooting
.
At
the
end
of
*NL*
August
he
heard
that
the
Oblonskys
had
gone
away
to
Moscow
,
from
their
*NL*
servant
who
brought
back
the
side-saddle
.
He
felt
that
in
not
answering
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
letter
he
had
by
his
rudeness
,
of
which
he
could
*NL*
not
think
without
a
flush
of
shame
,
burned
his
ships
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
never
go
and
see
them
again
.
He
had
been
just
as
rude
with
the
*NL*
Sviazhskys
,
leaving
them
without
saying
good-bye
.
But
he
would
never
go
*NL*
to
see
them
again
either
.
He
did
not
care
about
that
now
.
The
business
*NL*
of
reorganizing
the
farming
of
his
land
absorbed
him
as
completely
as
*NL*
though
there
would
never
be
anything
else
in
his
life
.
He
read
the
books
*NL*
lent
him
by
Sviazhsky
,
and
copying
out
what
he
had
not
got
,
he
read
both
*NL*
the
economic
and
socialistic
books
on
the
subject
,
but
,
as
he
had
*NL*
anticipated
,
found
nothing
bearing
on
the
scheme
he
had
undertaken
.
In
*NL*
the
books
on
political
economy
--
in
Mill
,
for
instance
,
whom
he
studied
*NL*
first
with
great
ardor
,
hoping
every
minute
to
find
an
answer
to
the
*NL*
questions
that
were
engrossing
him
--
he
found
laws
deduced
from
the
*NL*
condition
of
land
culture
in
Europe
;
but
he
did
not
see
why
these
laws
,
*NL*
which
did
not
apply
in
Russia
,
must
be
general
.
He
saw
just
the
same
*NL*
thing
in
the
socialistic
books
:
either
they
were
the
beautiful
but
*NL*
impracticable
fantasies
which
had
fascinated
him
when
he
was
a
student
,
*NL*
or
they
were
attempts
at
improving
,
rectifying
the
economic
position
in
*NL*
which
Europe
was
placed
,
with
which
the
system
of
land
tenure
in
Russia
*NL*
had
nothing
in
common
.
Political
economy
told
him
that
the
laws
by
which
*NL*
the
wealth
of
Europe
had
been
developed
,
and
was
developing
,
were
*NL*
universal
and
unvarying
.
Socialism
told
him
that
development
along
these
*NL*
lines
leads
to
ruin
.
And
neither
of
them
gave
an
answer
,
or
even
a
hint
,
*NL*
in
reply
to
the
question
what
he
,
Levin
,
and
all
the
Russian
peasants
*NL*
and
landowners
,
were
to
do
with
their
millions
of
hands
and
millions
of
*NL*
acres
,
to
make
them
as
productive
as
possible
for
the
common
weal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
once
taken
the
subject
up
,
he
read
conscientiously
everything
*NL*
bearing
on
it
,
and
intended
in
the
autumn
to
go
abroad
to
study
land
*NL*
systems
on
the
spot
,
in
order
that
he
might
not
on
this
question
be
*NL*
confronted
with
what
so
often
met
him
on
various
subjects
.
Often
,
just
*NL*
as
he
was
beginning
to
understand
the
idea
in
the
mind
of
anyone
he
was
*NL*
talking
to
,
and
was
beginning
to
explain
his
own
,
he
would
suddenly
be
*NL*
told
:
``
But
Kauffmann
,
but
Jones
,
but
Dubois
,
but
Michelli
?
You
have
n't
*NL*
read
them
:
they
've
thrashed
that
question
out
thoroughly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
now
distinctly
that
Kauffmann
and
Michelli
had
nothing
to
tell
*NL*
him
.
He
knew
what
he
wanted
.
He
saw
that
Russia
has
splendid
land
,
*NL*
splendid
laborers
,
and
that
in
certain
cases
,
as
at
the
peasant
's
on
the
*NL*
way
to
Sviazhsky
's
,
the
produce
raised
by
the
laborers
and
the
land
is
*NL*
great
--
in
the
majority
of
cases
when
capital
is
applied
in
the
European
*NL*
way
the
produce
is
small
,
and
that
this
simply
arises
from
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
laborers
want
to
work
and
work
well
only
in
their
own
peculiar
way
,
*NL*
and
that
this
antagonism
is
not
incidental
but
invariable
,
and
has
its
*NL*
roots
in
the
national
spirit
.
He
thought
that
the
Russian
people
whose
*NL*
task
it
was
to
colonize
and
cultivate
vast
tracts
of
unoccupied
land
,
*NL*
consciously
adhered
,
till
all
their
land
was
occupied
,
to
the
methods
*NL*
suitable
to
their
purpose
,
and
that
their
methods
were
by
no
means
so
*NL*
bad
as
was
generally
supposed
.
And
he
wanted
to
prove
this
theoretically
*NL*
in
his
book
and
practically
on
his
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
September
the
timber
had
been
carted
for
building
the
*NL*
cattleyard
on
the
land
that
had
been
allotted
to
the
association
of
*NL*
peasants
,
and
the
butter
from
the
cows
was
sold
and
the
profits
divided
.
*NL*
In
practice
the
system
worked
capitally
,
or
,
at
least
,
so
it
seemed
to
*NL*
Levin
.
In
order
to
work
out
the
whole
subject
theoretically
and
to
*NL*
complete
his
book
,
which
,
in
Levin
's
daydreams
,
was
not
merely
to
effect
*NL*
a
revolution
in
political
economy
,
but
to
annihilate
that
science
*NL*
entirely
and
to
lay
the
foundation
of
a
new
science
of
the
relation
of
*NL*
the
people
to
the
soil
,
all
that
was
left
to
do
was
to
make
a
tour
*NL*
abroad
,
and
to
study
on
the
spot
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
same
*NL*
direction
,
and
to
collect
conclusive
evidence
that
all
that
had
been
*NL*
done
there
was
not
what
was
wanted
.
Levin
was
only
waiting
for
the
*NL*
delivery
of
his
wheat
to
receive
the
money
for
it
and
go
abroad
.
But
the
*NL*
rains
began
,
preventing
the
harvesting
of
the
corn
and
potatoes
left
in
*NL*
the
fields
,
and
putting
a
stop
to
all
work
,
even
to
the
delivery
of
the
*NL*
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mud
was
impassable
along
the
roads
;
two
mills
were
carried
away
,
and
*NL*
the
weather
got
worse
and
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
30th
of
September
the
sun
came
out
in
the
morning
,
and
hoping
for
*NL*
fine
weather
,
Levin
began
making
final
preparations
for
his
journey
.
He
*NL*
gave
orders
for
the
wheat
to
be
delivered
,
sent
the
bailiff
to
the
*NL*
merchant
to
get
the
money
owing
him
,
and
went
out
himself
to
give
some
*NL*
final
directions
on
the
estate
before
setting
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
all
his
business
,
soaked
through
with
the
streams
of
*NL*
water
which
kept
running
down
the
leather
behind
his
neck
and
his
*NL*
gaiters
,
but
in
the
keenest
and
most
confident
temper
,
Levin
returned
*NL*
homewards
in
the
evening
.
The
weather
had
become
worse
than
ever
towards
*NL*
evening
;
the
hail
lashed
the
drenched
mare
so
cruelly
that
she
went
*NL*
along
sideways
,
shaking
her
head
and
ears
;
but
Levin
was
all
right
under
*NL*
his
hood
,
and
he
looked
cheerfully
about
him
at
the
muddy
streams
*NL*
running
under
the
wheels
,
at
the
drops
hanging
on
every
bare
twig
,
at
*NL*
the
whiteness
of
the
patch
of
unmelted
hailstones
on
the
planks
of
the
*NL*
bridge
,
at
the
thick
layer
of
still
juicy
,
fleshy
leaves
that
lay
heaped
*NL*
up
about
the
stripped
elm-tree
.
In
spite
of
the
gloominess
of
nature
*NL*
around
him
,
he
felt
peculiarly
eager
.
The
talks
he
had
been
having
with
*NL*
the
peasants
in
the
further
village
had
shown
that
they
were
beginning
*NL*
to
get
used
to
their
new
position
.
The
old
servant
to
whose
hut
he
had
*NL*
gone
to
get
dry
evidently
approved
of
Levin
's
plan
,
and
of
his
own
*NL*
accord
proposed
to
enter
the
partnership
by
the
purchase
of
cattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
to
go
stubbornly
on
towards
my
aim
,
and
I
shall
attain
my
*NL*
end
,
''
thought
Levin
;
``
and
it
's
something
to
work
and
take
trouble
for
.
*NL*
This
is
not
a
matter
of
myself
individually
;
the
question
of
the
public
*NL*
welfare
comes
into
it
.
The
whole
system
of
culture
,
the
chief
element
in
*NL*
the
condition
of
the
people
,
must
be
completely
transformed
.
Instead
of
*NL*
poverty
,
general
prosperity
and
content
;
instead
of
hostility
,
harmony
*NL*
and
unity
of
interests
.
In
short
,
a
bloodless
revolution
,
but
a
*NL*
revolution
of
the
greatest
magnitude
,
beginning
in
the
little
circle
of
*NL*
our
district
,
then
the
province
,
then
Russia
,
the
whole
world
.
Because
a
*NL*
just
idea
can
not
but
be
fruitful
.
Yes
,
it
's
an
aim
worth
working
for
.
*NL*
And
its
being
me
,
Kostya
Levin
,
who
went
to
a
ball
in
a
black
tie
,
and
*NL*
was
refused
by
the
Shtcherbatskaya
girl
,
and
who
was
intrinsically
such
*NL*
a
pitiful
,
worthless
creature
--
that
proves
nothing
;
I
feel
sure
Franklin
*NL*
felt
just
as
worthless
,
and
he
too
had
no
faith
in
himself
,
thinking
of
*NL*
himself
as
a
whole
.
That
means
nothing
.
And
he
too
,
most
likely
,
had
an
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
to
whom
he
confided
his
secrets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Musing
on
such
thoughts
Levin
reached
home
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
,
who
had
been
to
the
merchant
,
had
come
back
and
brought
*NL*
part
of
the
money
for
the
wheat
.
An
agreement
had
been
made
with
the
old
*NL*
servant
,
and
on
the
road
the
bailiff
had
learned
that
everywhere
the
*NL*
corn
was
still
standing
in
the
fields
,
so
that
his
one
hundred
and
sixty
*NL*
shocks
that
had
not
been
carried
were
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
*NL*
losses
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
Levin
was
sitting
,
as
he
usually
did
,
in
an
easy
chair
with
*NL*
a
book
,
and
as
he
read
he
went
on
thinking
of
the
journey
before
him
in
*NL*
connection
with
his
book
.
Today
all
the
significance
of
his
book
rose
*NL*
before
him
with
special
distinctness
,
and
whole
periods
ranged
*NL*
themselves
in
his
mind
in
illustration
of
his
theories
.
``
I
must
write
*NL*
that
down
,
''
he
thought
.
``
That
ought
to
form
a
brief
introduction
,
which
*NL*
I
thought
unnecessary
before
.
''
He
got
up
to
go
to
his
writing
table
,
and
*NL*
Laska
,
lying
at
his
feet
,
got
up
too
,
stretching
and
looking
at
him
as
*NL*
though
to
inquire
where
to
go
.
But
he
had
not
time
to
write
it
down
,
for
*NL*
the
head
peasants
had
come
round
,
and
Levin
went
out
into
the
hall
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
his
levee
,
that
is
to
say
,
giving
directions
about
the
labors
of
*NL*
the
next
day
,
and
seeing
all
the
peasants
who
had
business
with
him
,
*NL*
Levin
went
back
to
his
study
and
sat
down
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laska
lay
under
the
table
;
Agafea
Mihalovna
settled
herself
in
her
place
*NL*
with
her
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
writing
for
a
little
while
,
Levin
suddenly
thought
with
*NL*
exceptional
vividness
of
Kitty
,
her
refusal
,
and
their
last
meeting
.
He
*NL*
got
up
and
began
walking
about
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
being
dreary
?
''
said
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
``
Come
,
why
do
*NL*
you
stay
on
at
home
?
You
ought
to
go
to
some
warm
springs
,
especially
*NL*
now
you
're
ready
for
the
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
going
away
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
;
I
must
*NL*
finish
my
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
your
work
,
you
say
!
As
if
you
had
n't
done
enough
for
the
*NL*
peasants
!
Why
,
as
't
is
,
they
're
saying
,
`
Your
master
will
be
getting
*NL*
some
honor
from
the
Tsar
for
it
.
'
Indeed
and
it
is
a
strange
thing
;
why
*NL*
need
you
worry
about
the
peasants
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
worrying
about
them
;
I
'm
doing
it
for
my
own
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
knew
every
detail
of
Levin
's
plans
for
his
land
.
Levin
*NL*
often
put
his
views
before
her
in
all
their
complexity
,
and
not
*NL*
uncommonly
he
argued
with
her
and
did
not
agree
with
her
comments
.
But
*NL*
on
this
occasion
she
entirely
misinterpreted
what
he
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
one
's
soul
's
salvation
we
all
know
and
must
think
before
all
else
,
''
*NL*
she
said
with
a
sigh
.
``
Parfen
Denisitch
now
,
for
all
he
was
no
scholar
,
*NL*
he
died
a
death
that
God
grant
every
one
of
us
the
like
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
referring
to
a
servant
who
had
died
recently
.
``
Took
the
sacrament
and
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
what
I
mean
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
mean
that
I
'm
acting
for
my
own
*NL*
advantage
.
It
's
all
the
better
for
me
if
the
peasants
do
their
work
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
you
do
,
if
he
's
a
lazy
good-for-nought
,
everything
'll
be
*NL*
at
sixes
and
sevens
.
If
he
has
a
conscience
,
he
'll
work
,
and
if
not
,
*NL*
there
's
no
doing
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
you
say
yourself
Ivan
has
begun
looking
after
the
cattle
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
say
is
,
''
answered
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
evidently
not
speaking
at
*NL*
random
,
but
in
strict
sequence
of
idea
,
``
that
you
ought
to
get
married
,
*NL*
that
's
what
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
allusion
to
the
very
subject
he
had
only
just
been
*NL*
thinking
about
,
hurt
and
stung
him
.
Levin
scowled
,
and
without
answering
*NL*
her
,
he
sat
down
again
to
his
work
,
repeating
to
himself
all
that
he
had
*NL*
been
thinking
of
the
real
significance
of
that
work
.
Only
at
intervals
*NL*
he
listened
in
the
stillness
to
the
click
of
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
needles
,
*NL*
and
recollecting
what
he
did
not
want
to
remember
,
he
frowned
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
they
heard
the
bell
and
the
faint
vibration
of
a
*NL*
carriage
over
the
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
's
visitors
come
to
us
,
and
you
wo
n't
be
dull
,
''
said
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
getting
up
and
going
to
the
door
.
But
Levin
overtook
her
.
His
*NL*
work
was
not
going
well
now
,
and
he
was
glad
of
a
visitor
,
whoever
it
*NL*
might
be
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Running
halfway
down
the
staircase
,
Levin
caught
a
sound
he
knew
,
a
*NL*
familiar
cough
in
the
hall
.
But
he
heard
it
indistinctly
through
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
,
and
hoped
he
was
mistaken
.
Then
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
a
long
,
bony
,
familiar
figure
,
and
now
it
seemed
there
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
mistake
;
and
yet
he
still
went
on
hoping
that
this
tall
*NL*
man
taking
off
his
fur
cloak
and
coughing
was
not
his
brother
Nikolay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
loved
his
brother
,
but
being
with
him
was
always
a
torture
.
Just
*NL*
now
,
when
Levin
,
under
the
influence
of
the
thoughts
that
had
come
to
*NL*
him
,
and
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
hint
,
was
in
a
troubled
and
uncertain
humor
,
*NL*
the
meeting
with
his
brother
that
he
had
to
face
seemed
particularly
*NL*
difficult
.
Instead
of
a
lively
,
healthy
visitor
,
some
outsider
who
*NL*
would
,
he
hoped
,
cheer
him
up
in
his
uncertain
humor
,
he
had
to
see
his
*NL*
brother
,
who
knew
him
through
and
through
,
who
would
call
forth
all
the
*NL*
thoughts
nearest
his
heart
,
would
force
him
to
show
himself
fully
.
And
*NL*
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Angry
with
himself
for
so
base
a
feeling
,
Levin
ran
into
the
hall
;
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
seen
his
brother
close
,
this
feeling
of
selfish
*NL*
disappointment
vanished
instantly
and
was
replaced
by
pity
.
Terrible
as
*NL*
his
brother
Nikolay
had
been
before
in
his
emaciation
and
sickliness
,
*NL*
now
he
looked
still
more
emaciated
,
still
more
wasted
.
He
was
a
skeleton
*NL*
covered
with
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
the
hall
,
jerking
his
long
thin
neck
,
and
pulling
the
scarf
*NL*
off
it
,
and
smiled
a
strange
and
pitiful
smile
.
When
he
saw
that
smile
,
*NL*
submissive
and
humble
,
Levin
felt
something
clutching
at
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
've
come
to
you
,
''
said
Nikolay
in
a
thick
voice
,
never
for
*NL*
one
second
taking
his
eyes
off
his
brother
's
face
.
``
I
've
been
meaning
to
*NL*
a
long
while
,
but
I
've
been
unwell
all
the
time
.
Now
I
'm
ever
so
much
*NL*
better
,
''
he
said
,
rubbing
his
beard
with
his
big
thin
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
answered
Levin
.
And
he
felt
still
more
frightened
when
,
*NL*
kissing
him
,
he
felt
with
his
lips
the
dryness
of
his
brother
's
skin
and
*NL*
saw
close
to
him
his
big
eyes
,
full
of
a
strange
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
weeks
before
,
Konstantin
Levin
had
written
to
his
brother
that
*NL*
through
the
sale
of
the
small
part
of
the
property
,
that
had
remained
*NL*
undivided
,
there
was
a
sum
of
about
two
thousand
roubles
to
come
to
him
*NL*
as
his
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
said
that
he
had
come
now
to
take
this
money
and
,
what
was
more
*NL*
important
,
to
stay
a
while
in
the
old
nest
,
to
get
in
touch
with
the
*NL*
earth
,
so
as
to
renew
his
strength
like
the
heroes
of
old
for
the
work
*NL*
that
lay
before
him
.
In
spite
of
his
exaggerated
stoop
,
and
the
*NL*
emaciation
that
was
so
striking
from
his
height
,
his
movements
were
as
*NL*
rapid
and
abrupt
as
ever
.
Levin
led
him
into
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
dressed
with
particular
care
--
a
thing
he
never
used
to
*NL*
do
--
combed
his
scanty
,
lank
hair
,
and
,
smiling
,
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
most
affectionate
and
good-humored
mood
,
just
as
Levin
*NL*
often
remembered
him
in
childhood
.
He
even
referred
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
without
rancor
.
When
he
saw
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
he
made
jokes
with
her
and
*NL*
asked
after
the
old
servants
.
The
news
of
the
death
of
Parfen
Denisitch
*NL*
made
a
painful
impression
on
him
.
A
look
of
fear
crossed
his
face
,
but
*NL*
he
regained
his
serenity
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
was
quite
old
,
''
he
said
,
and
changed
the
subject
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
'll
spend
a
month
or
two
with
you
,
and
then
I
'm
off
to
Moscow
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
,
Myakov
has
promised
me
a
place
there
,
and
I
'm
going
into
the
*NL*
service
.
Now
I
'm
going
to
arrange
my
life
quite
differently
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
.
``
You
know
I
got
rid
of
that
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marya
Nikolaevna
?
Why
,
what
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
was
a
horrid
woman
!
She
caused
me
all
sorts
of
worries
.
''
But
he
*NL*
did
not
say
what
the
annoyances
were
.
He
could
not
say
that
he
had
cast
*NL*
off
Marya
Nikolaevna
because
the
tea
was
weak
,
and
,
above
all
,
because
*NL*
she
would
look
after
him
,
as
though
he
were
an
invalid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
I
want
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
completely
now
.
I
've
done
silly
*NL*
things
,
of
course
,
like
everyone
else
,
but
money
's
the
last
*NL*
consideration
;
I
do
n't
regret
it
.
So
long
as
there
's
health
,
and
my
*NL*
health
,
thank
God
,
is
quite
restored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
listened
and
racked
his
brains
,
but
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
Nikolay
probably
felt
the
same
;
he
began
questioning
his
brother
about
*NL*
his
affairs
;
and
Levin
was
glad
to
talk
about
himself
,
because
then
he
*NL*
could
speak
without
hypocrisy
.
He
told
his
brother
of
his
plans
and
his
*NL*
doings
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
listened
,
but
evidently
he
was
not
interested
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
men
were
so
akin
,
so
near
each
other
,
that
the
slightest
*NL*
gesture
,
the
tone
of
voice
,
told
both
more
than
could
be
said
in
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
of
them
now
had
only
one
thought
--
the
illness
of
Nikolay
and
the
*NL*
nearness
of
his
death
--
which
stifled
all
else
.
But
neither
of
them
dared
*NL*
to
speak
of
it
,
and
so
whatever
they
said
--
not
uttering
the
one
thought
*NL*
that
filled
their
minds
--
was
all
falsehood
.
Never
had
Levin
been
so
glad
*NL*
when
the
evening
was
over
and
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
.
Never
with
any
*NL*
outside
person
,
never
on
any
official
visit
had
he
been
so
unnatural
and
*NL*
false
as
he
was
that
evening
.
And
the
consciousness
of
this
*NL*
unnaturalness
,
and
the
remorse
he
felt
at
it
,
made
him
even
more
*NL*
unnatural
.
He
wanted
to
weep
over
his
dying
,
dearly
loved
brother
,
and
*NL*
he
had
to
listen
and
keep
on
talking
of
how
he
meant
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
house
was
damp
,
and
only
one
bedroom
had
been
kept
heated
,
Levin
*NL*
put
his
brother
to
sleep
in
his
own
bedroom
behind
a
screen
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
got
into
bed
,
and
whether
he
slept
or
did
not
sleep
,
tossed
*NL*
about
like
a
sick
man
,
coughed
,
and
when
he
could
not
get
his
throat
*NL*
clear
,
mumbled
something
.
Sometimes
when
his
breathing
was
painful
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
Sometimes
when
he
was
choking
he
muttered
angrily
,
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
devil
!
''
Levin
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
while
,
hearing
him
.
*NL*
His
thoughts
were
of
the
most
various
,
but
the
end
of
all
his
thoughts
*NL*
was
the
same
--
death
.
Death
,
the
inevitable
end
of
all
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
presented
itself
to
him
with
irresistible
force
.
And
death
,
which
*NL*
was
here
in
this
loved
brother
,
groaning
half
asleep
and
from
habit
*NL*
calling
without
distinction
on
God
and
the
devil
,
was
not
so
remote
as
*NL*
it
had
hitherto
seemed
to
him
.
It
was
in
himself
too
,
he
felt
that
.
If
*NL*
not
today
,
tomorrow
,
if
not
tomorrow
,
in
thirty
years
,
was
n't
it
all
the
*NL*
same
!
And
what
was
this
inevitable
death
--
he
did
not
know
,
had
never
*NL*
thought
about
it
,
and
what
was
more
,
had
not
the
power
,
had
not
the
*NL*
courage
to
think
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
work
,
I
want
to
do
something
,
but
I
had
forgotten
it
must
all
end
;
I
*NL*
had
forgotten
--
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
on
his
bed
in
the
darkness
,
crouched
up
,
hugging
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
holding
his
breath
from
the
strain
of
thought
,
he
pondered
.
But
the
more
*NL*
intensely
he
thought
,
the
clearer
it
became
to
him
that
it
was
*NL*
indubitably
so
,
that
in
reality
,
looking
upon
life
,
he
had
forgotten
one
*NL*
little
fact
--
that
death
will
come
,
and
all
ends
;
that
nothing
was
even
*NL*
worth
beginning
,
and
that
there
was
no
helping
it
anyway
.
Yes
,
it
was
*NL*
awful
,
but
it
was
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
alive
still
.
Now
what
's
to
be
done
?
what
's
to
be
done
?
''
he
*NL*
said
in
despair
.
He
lighted
a
candle
,
got
up
cautiously
and
went
to
the
*NL*
looking-glass
,
and
began
looking
at
his
face
and
hair
.
Yes
,
there
were
*NL*
gray
hairs
about
his
temples
.
He
opened
his
mouth
.
His
back
teeth
were
*NL*
beginning
to
decay
.
He
bared
his
muscular
arms
.
Yes
,
there
was
strength
*NL*
in
them
.
But
Nikolay
,
who
lay
there
breathing
with
what
was
left
of
*NL*
lungs
,
had
had
a
strong
,
healthy
body
too
.
And
suddenly
he
recalled
how
*NL*
they
used
to
go
to
bed
together
as
children
,
and
how
they
only
waited
*NL*
till
Fyodor
Bogdanitch
was
out
of
the
room
to
fling
pillows
at
each
*NL*
other
and
laugh
,
laugh
irrepressibly
,
so
that
even
their
awe
of
Fyodor
*NL*
Bogdanitch
could
not
check
the
effervescing
,
overbrimming
sense
of
life
*NL*
and
happiness
.
``
And
now
that
bent
,
hollow
chest
...
and
I
,
not
knowing
*NL*
what
will
become
of
me
,
or
wherefore
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
K.
.
.
ha
!
K.
.
.
ha
!
Damnation
!
Why
do
you
keep
fidgeting
,
why
do
n't
you
go
*NL*
to
sleep
?
''
his
brother
's
voice
called
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
I
'm
not
sleepy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
good
sleep
,
I
'm
not
in
a
sweat
now
.
Just
see
,
feel
my
*NL*
shirt
;
it
's
not
wet
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
,
withdrew
behind
the
screen
,
and
put
out
the
candle
,
but
for
*NL*
a
long
while
he
could
not
sleep
.
The
question
how
to
live
had
hardly
*NL*
begun
to
grow
a
little
clearer
to
him
,
when
a
new
,
insoluble
question
*NL*
presented
itself
--
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
's
dying
--
yes
,
he
'll
die
in
the
spring
,
and
how
help
him
?
What
*NL*
can
I
say
to
him
?
What
do
I
know
about
it
?
I
'd
even
forgotten
that
it
*NL*
was
at
all

Chapter
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
long
before
made
the
observation
that
when
one
is
*NL*
uncomfortable
with
people
from
their
being
excessively
amenable
and
*NL*
meek
,
one
is
apt
very
soon
after
to
find
things
intolerable
from
their
*NL*
touchiness
and
irritability
.
He
felt
that
this
was
how
it
would
be
with
*NL*
his
brother
.
And
his
brother
Nikolay
's
gentleness
did
in
fact
not
last
*NL*
out
for
long
.
The
very
next
morning
he
began
to
be
irritable
,
and
seemed
*NL*
doing
his
best
to
find
fault
with
his
brother
,
attacking
him
on
his
*NL*
tenderest
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
himself
to
blame
,
and
could
not
set
things
right
.
He
felt
*NL*
that
if
they
had
both
not
kept
up
appearances
,
but
had
spoken
,
as
it
is
*NL*
called
,
from
the
heart
--
that
is
to
say
,
had
said
only
just
what
they
*NL*
were
thinking
and
feeling
--
they
would
simply
have
looked
into
each
*NL*
other
's
faces
,
and
Konstantin
could
only
have
said
,
``
You
're
dying
,
*NL*
you
're
dying
!
''
and
Nikolay
could
only
have
answered
,
``
I
know
I
'm
dying
,
*NL*
but
I
'm
afraid
,
I
'm
afraid
,
I
'm
afraid
!
''
And
they
could
have
said
*NL*
nothing
more
,
if
they
had
said
only
what
was
in
their
hearts
.
But
life
*NL*
like
that
was
impossible
,
and
so
Konstantin
tried
to
do
what
he
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
do
all
his
life
,
and
never
could
learn
to
do
,
though
,
as
far
*NL*
as
he
could
observe
,
many
people
knew
so
well
how
to
do
it
,
and
without
*NL*
it
there
was
no
living
at
all
.
He
tried
to
say
what
he
was
not
thinking
,
*NL*
but
he
felt
continually
that
it
had
a
ring
of
falsehood
,
that
his
*NL*
brother
detected
him
in
it
,
and
was
exasperated
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
day
Nikolay
induced
his
brother
to
explain
his
plan
to
him
*NL*
again
,
and
began
not
merely
attacking
it
,
but
intentionally
confounding
*NL*
it
with
communism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
simply
borrowed
an
idea
that
's
not
your
own
,
but
you
've
*NL*
distorted
it
,
and
are
trying
to
apply
it
where
it
's
not
applicable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
tell
you
it
's
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
They
deny
the
justice
of
*NL*
property
,
of
capital
,
of
inheritance
,
while
I
do
not
deny
this
chief
*NL*
stimulus

''
-LRB-
Levin
felt
disgusted
himself
at
using
such
expressions
,
but
*NL*
ever
since
he
had
been
engrossed
by
his
work
,
he
had
unconsciously
come
*NL*
more
and
more
frequently
to
use
words
not
Russian
.
-RRB-
``
All
I
want
is
to
*NL*
regulate
labor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
means
,
you
've
borrowed
an
idea
,
stripped
it
of
all
that
gave
it
*NL*
its
force
,
and
want
to
make
believe
that
it
's
something
new

said
*NL*
Nikolay
,
angrily
tugging
at
his
necktie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
idea
has
nothing
in
common

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
anyway

said
Nikolay
Levin
,
with
an
ironical
smile
,
his
eyes
*NL*
flashing
malignantly
,
``
has
the
charm
of

what
's
one
to
call
*NL*
it
?
--
geometrical
symmetry
,
of
clearness

of
definiteness

It
may
be
a

Utopia

But
if
once
one
allows
the
possibility
of
making
of
all
the
past
*NL*
a
_
tabula
rasa
_

no

no

labor

itself

nothing

up

``

I
have
,

I
consider

premature

``
All
that

*NL*
Levin
suddenly
lost
his
temper
at
these
words
,
because
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
his
heart
he
was
afraid
that
it
was
true
--
true
that
he
was
trying
to
*NL*
hold
the
balance
even
between
communism
and
the
familiar
forms
,
and
that
*NL*
this
was
hardly
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
trying
to
find
means
of
working
productively
for
myself
and
for
*NL*
the
laborers
.
I
want
to
organize
...
''
he
answered
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
to
organize
anything
;
it
's
simply
just
as
you
've
been
*NL*
all
your
life
,
that
you
want
to
be
original
to
pose
as
not
exploiting
*NL*
the
peasants
simply
,
but
with
some
idea
in
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
that
's
what
you
think
--
and
let
me
alone
!
''
answered
*NL*
Levin
,
feeling
the
muscles
of
his
left
cheek
twitching
uncontrollably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
never
had
,
and
never
have
,
convictions
;
all
you
want
is
to
*NL*
please
your
vanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
;
then
let
me
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
will
let
you
alone
!
and
it
's
high
time
I
did
,
and
go
to
the
devil
*NL*
with
you
!
and
I
'm
very
sorry
I
ever
came
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
Levin
's
efforts
to
soothe
his
brother
afterwards
,
*NL*
Nikolay
would
listen
to
nothing
he
said
,
declaring
that
it
was
better
to
*NL*
part
,
and
Konstantin
saw
that
it
simply
was
that
life
was
unbearable
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nikolay
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
,
when
Konstantin
went
in
to
him
*NL*
again
and
begged
him
,
rather
unnaturally
,
to
forgive
him
if
he
had
hurt
*NL*
his
feelings
in
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
generosity
!
''
said
Nikolay
,
and
he
smiled
.
``
If
you
want
to
be
right
,
*NL*
I
can
give
you
that
satisfaction
.
You
're
in
the
right
;
but
I
'm
going
all
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
just
at
parting
that
Nikolay
kissed
him
,
and
said
,
looking
*NL*
with
sudden
strangeness
and
seriousness
at
his
brother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
do
n't
remember
evil
against
me
,
Kostya
!
''
and
his
voice
*NL*
quivered
.
These
were
the
only
words
that
had
been
spoken
sincerely
*NL*
between
them
.
Levin
knew
that
those
words
meant
,
``
You
see
,
and
you
know
,
*NL*
that
I
'm
in
a
bad
way
,
and
maybe
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
.
''
*NL*
Levin
knew
this
,
and
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
.
He
kissed
his
*NL*
brother
once
more
,
but
he
could
not
speak
,
and
knew
not
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
his
brother
's
departure
,
Levin
too
set
off
for
his
*NL*
foreign
tour
.
Happening
to
meet
Shtcherbatsky
,
Kitty
's
cousin
,
in
the
*NL*
railway
train
,
Levin
greatly
astonished
him
by
his
depression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
Shtcherbatsky
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
;
there
's
not
much
happiness
in
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
?
You
come
with
me
to
Paris
instead
of
to
Mulhausen
.
You
shall
*NL*
see
how
to
be
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
done
with
it
all
.
It
's
time
I
was
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
a
good
one
!
''
said
Shtcherbatsky
,
laughing
;
``
why
,
I
'm
only
*NL*
just
getting
ready
to
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
thought
the
same
not
long
ago
,
but
now
I
know
I
shall
soon
be
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
said
what
he
had
genuinely
been
thinking
of
late
.
He
saw
nothing
*NL*
but
death
or
the
advance
towards
death
in
everything
.
But
his
cherished
*NL*
scheme
only
engrossed
him
the
more
.
Life
had
to
be
got
through
somehow
*NL*
till
death
did
come
.
Darkness
had
fallen
upon
everything
for
him
;
but
*NL*
just
because
of
this
darkness
he
felt
that
the
one
guiding
clue
in
the
*NL*
darkness
was
his
work
,
and
he
clutched
it
and
clung
to
it
with
all
his
*NL*
strength
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Karenins
,
husband
and
wife
,
continued
living
in
the
same
house
,
met
*NL*
every
day
,
but
were
complete
strangers
to
one
another
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
made
it
a
rule
to
see
his
wife
every
day
,
so
that
the
*NL*
servants
might
have
no
grounds
for
suppositions
,
but
avoided
dining
at
*NL*
home
.
Vronsky
was
never
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
house
,
but
Anna
saw
*NL*
him
away
from
home
,
and
her
husband
was
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
position
was
one
of
misery
for
all
three
;
and
not
one
of
them
would
*NL*
have
been
equal
to
enduring
this
position
for
a
single
day
,
if
it
had
*NL*
not
been
for
the
expectation
that
it
would
change
,
that
it
was
merely
a
*NL*
temporary
painful
ordeal
which
would
pass
over
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
hoped
that
this
passion
would
pass
,
as
everything
does
pass
,
that
*NL*
everyone
would
forget
about
it
,
and
his
name
would
remain
unsullied
.
*NL*
Anna
,
on
whom
the
position
depended
,
and
for
whom
it
was
more
miserable
*NL*
than
for
anyone
,
endured
it
because
she
not
merely
hoped
,
but
firmly
*NL*
believed
,
that
it
would
all
very
soon
be
settled
and
come
right
.
She
had
*NL*
not
the
least
idea
what
would
settle
the
position
,
but
she
firmly
*NL*
believed
that
something
would
very
soon
turn
up
now
.
Vronsky
,
against
*NL*
his
own
will
or
wishes
,
followed
her
lead
,
hoped
too
that
something
,
*NL*
apart
from
his
own
action
,
would
be
sure
to
solve
all
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
winter
Vronsky
spent
a
very
tiresome
week
.
A
*NL*
foreign
prince
,
who
had
come
on
a
visit
to
Petersburg
,
was
put
under
his
*NL*
charge
,
and
he
had
to
show
him
the
sights
worth
seeing
.
Vronsky
was
of
*NL*
distinguished
appearance
;
he
possessed
,
moreover
,
the
art
of
behaving
*NL*
with
respectful
dignity
,
and
was
used
to
having
to
do
with
such
grand
*NL*
personages
--
that
was
how
he
came
to
be
put
in
charge
of
the
prince
.
But
*NL*
he
felt
his
duties
very
irksome
.
The
prince
was
anxious
to
miss
nothing
*NL*
of
which
he
would
be
asked
at
home
,
had
he
seen
that
in
Russia
?
And
on
*NL*
his
own
account
he
was
anxious
to
enjoy
to
the
utmost
all
Russian
forms
*NL*
of
amusement
.
Vronsky
was
obliged
to
be
his
guide
in
satisfying
both
*NL*
these
inclinations
.
The
mornings
they
spent
driving
to
look
at
places
of
*NL*
interest
;
the
evenings
they
passed
enjoying
the
national
entertainments
.
*NL*
The
prince
rejoiced
in
health
exceptional
even
among
princes
.
By
*NL*
gymnastics
and
careful
attention
to
his
health
he
had
brought
himself
to
*NL*
such
a
point
that
in
spite
of
his
excess
in
pleasure
he
looked
as
fresh
*NL*
as
a
big
glossy
green
Dutch
cucumber
.
The
prince
had
traveled
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
and
considered
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
modern
facilities
of
*NL*
communication
was
the
accessibility
of
the
pleasures
of
all
nations
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
in
Spain
,
and
there
had
indulged
in
serenades
and
had
made
*NL*
friends
with
a
Spanish
girl
who
played
the
mandolin
.
In
Switzerland
he
*NL*
had
killed
chamois
.
In
England
he
had
galloped
in
a
red
coat
over
hedges
*NL*
and
killed
two
hundred
pheasants
for
a
bet
.
In
Turkey
he
had
got
into
a
*NL*
harem
;
in
India
he
had
hunted
on
an
elephant
,
and
now
in
Russia
he
*NL*
wished
to
taste
all
the
specially
Russian
forms
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
who
was
,
as
it
were
,
chief
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
him
,
was
*NL*
at
great
pains
to
arrange
all
the
Russian
amusements
suggested
by
*NL*
various
persons
to
the
prince
.
They
had
race
horses
,
and
Russian
*NL*
pancakes
and
bear
hunts
and
three-horse
sledges
,
and
gypsies
and
*NL*
drinking
feasts
,
with
the
Russian
accompaniment
of
broken
crockery
.
And
*NL*
the
prince
with
surprising
ease
fell
in
with
the
Russian
spirit
,
smashed
*NL*
trays
full
of
crockery
,
sat
with
a
gypsy
girl
on
his
knee
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
be
asking
--
what
more
,
and
does
the
whole
Russian
spirit
consist
in
just
*NL*
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
of
all
the
Russian
entertainments
the
prince
liked
best
*NL*
French
actresses
and
ballet
dancers
and
white-seal
champagne
.
Vronsky
*NL*
was
used
to
princes
,
but
,
either
because
he
had
himself
changed
of
late
,
*NL*
or
that
he
was
in
too
close
proximity
to
the
prince
,
that
week
seemed
*NL*
fearfully
wearisome
to
him
.
The
whole
of
that
week
he
experienced
a
*NL*
sensation
such
as
a
man
might
have
set
in
charge
of
a
dangerous
madman
,
*NL*
afraid
of
the
madman
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
from
being
with
him
,
fearing
*NL*
for
his
own
reason
.
Vronsky
was
continually
conscious
of
the
necessity
*NL*
of
never
for
a
second
relaxing
the
tone
of
stern
official
*NL*
respectfulness
,
that
he
might
not
himself
be
insulted
.
The
prince
's
*NL*
manner
of
treating
the
very
people
who
,
to
Vronsky
's
surprise
,
were
*NL*
ready
to
descend
to
any
depths
to
provide
him
with
Russian
amusements
,
*NL*
was
contemptuous
.
His
criticisms
of
Russian
women
,
whom
he
wished
to
*NL*
study
,
more
than
once
made
Vronsky
crimson
with
indignation
.
The
chief
*NL*
reason
why
the
prince
was
so
particularly
disagreeable
to
Vronsky
was
*NL*
that
he
could
not
help
seeing
himself
in
him
.
And
what
he
saw
in
this
*NL*
mirror
did
not
gratify
his
self-esteem
.
He
was
a
very
stupid
and
very
*NL*
self-satisfied
and
very
healthy
and
very
well-washed
man
,
and
nothing
*NL*
else
.
He
was
a
gentleman
--
that
was
true
,
and
Vronsky
could
not
deny
it
.
*NL*
He
was
equable
and
not
cringing
with
his
superiors
,
was
free
and
*NL*
ingratiating
in
his
behavior
with
his
equals
,
and
was
contemptuously
*NL*
indulgent
with
his
inferiors
.
Vronsky
was
himself
the
same
,
and
regarded
*NL*
it
as
a
great
merit
to
be
so
.
But
for
this
prince
he
was
an
inferior
,
*NL*
and
his
contemptuous
and
indulgent
attitude
to
him
revolted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brainless
beef
!
can
I
be
like
that
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
that
as
it
might
,
when
,
on
the
seventh
day
,
he
parted
from
the
*NL*
prince
,
who
was
starting
for
Moscow
,
and
received
his
thanks
,
he
was
*NL*
happy
to
be
rid
of
his
uncomfortable
position
and
the
unpleasant
*NL*
reflection
of
himself
.
He
said
good-bye
to
him
at
the
station
on
their
*NL*
return
from
a
bear
hunt
,
at
which
they
had
had
a
display
of
Russian
*NL*
prowess
kept
up
all
night
.

When
he
got
home
,
Vronsky
found
there
a
note
from
Anna
.
She
wrote
,
``
I
am
*NL*
ill
and
unhappy
.
I
can
not
come
out
,
but
I
can
not
go
on
longer
without
*NL*
seeing
you
.
Come
in
this
evening
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
goes
to
the
*NL*
council
at
seven
and
will
be
there
till
ten
.
''
Thinking
for
an
instant
of
*NL*
the
strangeness
of
her
bidding
him
come
straight
to
her
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
insisting
on
her
not
receiving
him
,
he
decided
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
that
winter
got
his
promotion
,
was
now
a
colonel
,
had
left
*NL*
the
regimental
quarters
,
and
was
living
alone
.
After
having
some
lunch
,
*NL*
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
immediately
,
and
in
five
minutes
memories
of
the
*NL*
hideous
scenes
he
had
witnessed
during
the
last
few
days
were
confused
*NL*
together
and
joined
on
to
a
mental
image
of
Anna
and
of
the
peasant
who
*NL*
had
played
an
important
part
in
the
bear
hunt
,
and
Vronsky
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
He
waked
up
in
the
dark
,
trembling
with
horror
,
and
made
haste
to
light
*NL*
a
candle
.
``
What
was
it
?
What
?
What
was
the
dreadful
thing
I
dreamed
?
*NL*
Yes
,
yes
;
I
think
a
little
dirty
man
with
a
disheveled
beard
was
*NL*
stooping
down
doing
something
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
began
saying
some
*NL*
strange
words
in
French
.
Yes
,
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
dream
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
``
But
why
was
it
so
awful
?
''
He
vividly
recalled
the
*NL*
peasant
again
and
those
incomprehensible
French
words
the
peasant
had
*NL*
uttered
,
and
a
chill
of
horror
ran
down
his
spine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
!
''
thought
Vronsky
,
and
glanced
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
half-past
eight
already
.
He
rang
up
his
servant
,
dressed
in
*NL*
haste
,
and
went
out
onto
the
steps
,
completely
forgetting
the
dream
and
*NL*
only
worried
at
being
late
.
As
he
drove
up
to
the
Karenins
'
entrance
he
*NL*
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine
.
A
high
,
narrow
*NL*
carriage
with
a
pair
of
grays
was
standing
at
the
entrance
.
He
*NL*
recognized
Anna
's
carriage
.
``
She
is
coming
to
me
,
''
thought
Vronsky
,
``
and
*NL*
better
she
should
.
I
do
n't
like
going
into
that
house
.
But
no
matter
;
I
*NL*
ca
n't
hide
myself
,
''
he
thought
,
and
with
that
manner
peculiar
to
him
*NL*
from
childhood
,
as
of
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
,
Vronsky
*NL*
got
out
of
his
sledge
and
went
to
the
door
.
The
door
opened
,
and
the
*NL*
hall
porter
with
a
rug
on
his
arm
called
the
carriage
.
Vronsky
,
though
*NL*
he
did
not
usually
notice
details
,
noticed
at
this
moment
the
amazed
*NL*
expression
with
which
the
porter
glanced
at
him
.
In
the
very
doorway
*NL*
Vronsky
almost
ran
up
against
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
The
gas
jet
threw
*NL*
its
full
light
on
the
bloodless
,
sunken
face
under
the
black
hat
and
on
*NL*
the
white
cravat
,
brilliant
against
the
beaver
of
the
coat
.
Karenin
's
*NL*
fixed
,
dull
eyes
were
fastened
upon
Vronsky
's
face
.
Vronsky
bowed
,
and
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
chewing
his
lips
,
lifted
his
hand
to
his
hat
and
*NL*
went
on
.
Vronsky
saw
him
without
looking
round
get
into
the
carriage
,
*NL*
pick
up
the
rug
and
the
opera-glass
at
the
window
and
disappear
.
Vronsky
*NL*
went
into
the
hall
.
His
brows
were
scowling
,
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
a
*NL*
proud
and
angry
light
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
position
!
''
he
thought
.
``
If
he
would
fight
,
would
stand
up
for
*NL*
his
honor
,
I
could
act
,
could
express
my
feelings
;
but
this
weakness
or
*NL*
baseness
...
He
puts
me
in
the
position
of
playing
false
,
which
I
never
*NL*
meant
and
never
mean
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
ideas
had
changed
since
the
day
of
his
conversation
with
Anna
*NL*
in
the
Vrede
garden
.
Unconsciously
yielding
to
the
weakness
of
Anna
--
who
*NL*
had
surrendered
herself
up
to
him
utterly
,
and
simply
looked
to
him
to
*NL*
decide
her
fate
,
ready
to
submit
to
anything
--
he
had
long
ceased
to
*NL*
think
that
their
tie
might
end
as
he
had
thought
then
.
His
ambitious
*NL*
plans
had
retreated
into
the
background
again
,
and
feeling
that
he
had
*NL*
got
out
of
that
circle
of
activity
in
which
everything
was
definite
,
he
*NL*
had
given
himself
entirely
to
his
passion
,
and
that
passion
was
binding
*NL*
him
more
and
more
closely
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
in
the
hall
when
he
caught
the
sound
of
her
retreating
*NL*
footsteps
.
He
knew
she
had
been
expecting
him
,
had
listened
for
him
,
and
*NL*
was
now
going
back
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
cried
,
on
seeing
him
,
and
at
the
first
sound
of
her
voice
the
*NL*
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
``
No
;
if
things
are
to
go
on
like
this
,
the
end
*NL*
will
come
much
,
much
too
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
dear
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
I
've
been
waiting
in
agony
for
an
hour
,
two
hours
...
No
,
I
wo
n't
*NL*
...
I
ca
n't
quarrel
with
you
.
Of
course
you
could
n't
come
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
She
laid
her
two
hands
on
his
shoulders
,
and
looked
a
long
while
at
him
*NL*
with
a
profound
,
passionate
,
and
at
the
same
time
searching
look
.
She
*NL*
was
studying
his
face
to
make
up
for
the
time
she
had
not
seen
him
.
She
*NL*
was
,
every
time
she
saw
him
,
making
the
picture
of
him
in
her
*NL*
imagination
-LRB-
incomparably
superior
,
impossible
in
reality
-RRB-
fit
with
him
*NL*
as
he
really
was
.

*NL*
``
You
met
him
?
''
she
asked
,
when
they
had
sat
down
at
the
table
in
the
*NL*
lamplight
.
``
You
're
punished
,
you
see
,
for
being
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
how
was
it
?
Was
n't
he
to
be
at
the
council
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
been
and
come
back
,
and
was
going
out
somewhere
again
.
But
*NL*
that
's
no
matter
.
Do
n't
talk
about
it
.
Where
have
you
been
?
With
the
*NL*
prince
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
every
detail
of
his
existence
.
He
was
going
to
say
that
he
had
*NL*
been
up
all
night
and
had
dropped
asleep
,
but
looking
at
her
thrilled
*NL*
and
rapturous
face
,
he
was
ashamed
.
And
he
said
he
had
had
to
go
to
*NL*
report
on
the
prince
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
over
now
?
He
is
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
it
's
over
!
You
would
n't
believe
how
insufferable
it
's
been
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
Is
n't
it
the
life
all
of
you
,
all
young
men
,
always
lead
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
knitting
her
brows
;
and
taking
up
the
crochet
work
that
was
lying
*NL*
on
the
table
,
she
began
drawing
the
hook
out
of
it
,
without
looking
at
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
that
life
up
long
ago
,
''
said
he
,
wondering
at
the
change
in
her
*NL*
face
,
and
trying
to
divine
its
meaning
.
``
And
I
confess
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
showing
his
thick
,
white
teeth
,
``
this
week
I
've
been
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
looking
at
myself
in
a
glass
,
seeing
that
life
,
and
I
did
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
work
in
her
hands
,
but
did
not
crochet
,
and
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
strange
,
shining
,
and
hostile
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
Liza
came
to
see
me
--
they
're
not
afraid
to
call
on
me
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
''
she
put
in
--
``
and
she
told
me
*NL*
about
your
Athenian
evening
.
How
loathsome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
to
say
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
him
.
``
It
was
that
Therese
you
used
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
saying
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
disgusting
you
are
,
you
men
!
How
is
it
you
ca
n't
understand
that
a
*NL*
woman
can
never
forget
that
,
''
she
said
,
getting
more
and
more
angry
,
and
*NL*
so
letting
him
see
the
cause
of
her
irritation
,
``
especially
a
woman
who
*NL*
can
not
know
your
life
?
What
do
I
know
?
What
have
I
ever
known
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
what
you
tell
me
.
And
how
do
I
know
whether
you
tell
me
the
*NL*
truth
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
you
hurt
me
.
Do
n't
you
trust
me
?
Have
n't
I
told
you
that
I
*NL*
have
n't
a
thought
I
would
n't
lay
bare
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
she
said
,
evidently
trying
to
suppress
her
jealous
thoughts
.
*NL*
``
But
if
only
you
knew
how
wretched
I
am
!
I
believe
you
,
I
believe
*NL*
you
...
What
were
you
saying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
could
not
at
once
recall
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
.
These
*NL*
fits
of
jealousy
,
which
of
late
had
been
more
and
more
frequent
with
*NL*
her
,
horrified
him
,
and
however
much
he
tried
to
disguise
the
fact
,
made
*NL*
him
feel
cold
to
her
,
although
he
knew
the
cause
of
her
jealousy
was
her
*NL*
love
for
him
.
How
often
he
had
told
himself
that
her
love
was
happiness
;
*NL*
and
now
she
loved
him
as
a
woman
can
love
when
love
has
outweighed
for
*NL*
her
all
the
good
things
of
life
--
and
he
was
much
further
from
happiness
*NL*
than
when
he
had
followed
her
from
Moscow
.
Then
he
had
thought
himself
*NL*
unhappy
,
but
happiness
was
before
him
;
now
he
felt
that
the
best
*NL*
happiness
was
already
left
behind
.
She
was
utterly
unlike
what
she
had
*NL*
been
when
he
first
saw
her
.
Both
morally
and
physically
she
had
changed
*NL*
for
the
worse
.
She
had
broadened
out
all
over
,
and
in
her
face
at
the
*NL*
time
when
she
was
speaking
of
the
actress
there
was
an
evil
expression
*NL*
of
hatred
that
distorted
it
.
He
looked
at
her
as
a
man
looks
at
a
faded
*NL*
flower
he
has
gathered
,
with
difficulty
recognizing
in
it
the
beauty
for
*NL*
which
he
picked
and
ruined
it
.
And
in
spite
of
this
he
felt
that
then
,
*NL*
when
his
love
was
stronger
,
he
could
,
if
he
had
greatly
wished
it
,
have
*NL*
torn
that
love
out
of
his
heart
;
but
now
,
when
as
at
that
moment
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
he
felt
no
love
for
her
,
he
knew
that
what
bound
him
to
*NL*
her
could
not
be
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
about
the
prince
?
I
have
*NL*
driven
away
the
fiend
,
''
she
added
.
The
fiend
was
the
name
they
had
given
*NL*
her
jealousy
.
``
What
did
you
begin
to
tell
me
about
the
prince
?
Why
did
*NL*
you
find
it
so
tiresome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
was
intolerable
!
''
he
said
,
trying
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
interrupted
thought
.
``
He
does
not
improve
on
closer
acquaintance
.
If
you
*NL*
want
him
defined
,
here
he
is
:
a
prime
,
well-fed
beast
such
as
takes
*NL*
medals
at
the
cattle
shows
,
and
nothing
more
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
tone
of
*NL*
vexation
that
interested
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
how
so
?
''
she
replied
.
``
He
's
seen
a
great
deal
,
anyway
;
he
's
*NL*
cultured
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
utterly
different
culture
--
their
culture
.
He
's
cultivated
,
one
*NL*
sees
,
simply
to
be
able
to
despise
culture
,
as
they
despise
everything
*NL*
but
animal
pleasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
you
all
care
for
these
animal
pleasures
?
''
she
said
,
and
again
*NL*
he
noticed
a
dark
look
in
her
eyes
that
avoided
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
you
're
defending
him
?
''
he
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
defending
him
,
it
's
nothing
to
me
;
but
I
imagine
,
if
you
had
*NL*
not
cared
for
those
pleasures
yourself
,
you
might
have
got
out
of
them
.
*NL*
But
if
it
affords
you
satisfaction
to
gaze
at
Therese
in
the
attire
of
*NL*
Eve
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
,
the
devil
again
,
''
Vronsky
said
,
taking
the
hand
she
had
laid
on
*NL*
the
table
and
kissing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
You
do
n't
know
what
I
have
suffered
waiting
*NL*
for
you
.
I
believe
I
'm
not
jealous
.
I
'm
not
jealous
:
I
believe
you
when
*NL*
you
're
here
;
but
when
you
're
away
somewhere
leading
your
life
,
so
*NL*
incomprehensible
to
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
from
him
,
pulled
the
hook
at
last
out
of
the
crochet
*NL*
work
,
and
rapidly
,
with
the
help
of
her
forefinger
,
began
working
loop
*NL*
after
loop
of
the
wool
that
was
dazzling
white
in
the
lamplight
,
while
*NL*
the
slender
wrist
moved
swiftly
,
nervously
in
the
embroidered
cuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
,
then
?
Where
did
you
meet
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
?
''
Her
voice
*NL*
sounded
in
an
unnatural
and
jarring
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ran
up
against
each
other
in
the
doorway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
bowed
to
you
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
drew
a
long
face
,
and
half-closing
her
eyes
,
quickly
transformed
her
*NL*
expression
,
folded
her
hands
,
and
Vronsky
suddenly
saw
in
her
beautiful
*NL*
face
the
very
expression
with
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
bowed
to
*NL*
him
.
He
smiled
,
while
she
laughed
gaily
,
with
that
sweet
,
deep
laugh
,
*NL*
which
was
one
of
her
greatest
charms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
him
in
the
least
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
If
after
your
*NL*
avowal
to
him
at
your
country
house
he
had
broken
with
you
,
if
he
had
*NL*
called
me
out
--
but
this
I
ca
n't
understand
.
How
can
he
put
up
with
such
*NL*
a
position
?
He
feels
it
,
that
's
evident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
''
she
said
sneeringly
.
``
He
's
perfectly
satisfied

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
all
miserable
for
,
when
everything
might
be
so
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
not
he

Do
n't
I
know
him

the
falsity
in
which
he
's
utterly
*NL*
steeped
?
...
Could
one

with
any
feeling
,
live
as
he
is
living
with

*NL*
He
understands
nothing

and
feels
nothing

Could
a
man
of
any
feeling
*NL*
live
in
the
same
house
with
his
unfaithful
wife
?
Could
he
talk
to

*NL*
call
her
`

*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
could
not
help
mimicking
him
:
''
`
Anna

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``

soothe

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
mocking
amusement
.
Evidently
she
had
hit
on
other
*NL*
absurd
and
grotesque
aspects
in
her
husband
and
was
awaiting
the
moment
*NL*
to
give
expression
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
it
's
not
illness
,
but
your
condition
.
When
will
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ironical
light
died
away
in
her
eyes
,
but
a
different
smile
,
a
*NL*
consciousness
of
something
,
he
did
not
know
what
,
and
of
quiet
*NL*
melancholy
,
came
over
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
,
soon
.
You
say
that
our
position
is
miserable
,
that
we
must
put
an
*NL*
end
to
it
.
If
you
knew
how
terrible
it
is
to
me
,
what
I
would
give
to
be
*NL*
able
to
love
you
freely
and
boldly
!
I
should
not
torture
myself
and
*NL*
torture
you
with
my
jealousy
...
And
it
will
come
soon
,
but
not
as
we
*NL*
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
thought
of
how
it
would
come
,
she
seemed
so
pitiable
to
*NL*
herself
that
tears
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
she
could
not
go
on
.
She
laid
*NL*
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
,
dazzling
and
white
with
its
rings
in
the
*NL*
lamplight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
come
as
we
suppose
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
say
this
to
you
,
but
*NL*
you
've
made
me
.
Soon
,
soon
,
all
will
be
over
,
and
we
shall
all
,
all
be
*NL*
at
peace
,
and
suffer
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
he
said
,
understanding
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
asked
when
?
Soon
.
And
I
sha
n't
live
through
it
.
Do
n't
interrupt
*NL*
me
!
''
and
she
made
haste
to
speak
.
``
I
know
it
;
I
know
for
certain
.
I
*NL*
shall
die
;
and
I
'm
very
glad
I
shall
die
,
and
release
myself
and
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
dropped
from
her
eyes
;
he
bent
down
over
her
hand
and
began
*NL*
kissing
it
,
trying
to
hide
his
emotion
,
which
,
he
knew
,
had
no
sort
of
*NL*
grounds
,
though
he
could
not
control
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
better
so
,
''
she
said
,
tightly
gripping
his
hand
.
``
That
's
the
*NL*
only
way
,
the
only
way
left
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
recovered
himself
,
and
lifted
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
absurd
!
What
absurd
nonsense
you
are
talking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
what
's
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
shall
die
.
I
have
had
a
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dream
?
''
repeated
Vronsky
,
and
instantly
he
recalled
the
peasant
of
*NL*
his
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
dream
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
a
long
while
since
I
dreamed
it
.
I
*NL*
dreamed
that
I
ran
into
my
bedroom
,
that
I
had
to
get
something
there
,
*NL*
to
find
out
something
;
you
know
how
it
is
in
dreams
,
''
she
said
,
her
eyes
*NL*
wide
with
horror
;
``
and
in
the
bedroom
,
in
the
corner
,
stood
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
nonsense
!
How
can
you
believe
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
would
not
let
him
interrupt
her
.
What
she
was
saying
was
too
*NL*
important
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
something
turned
round
,
and
I
saw
it
was
a
peasant
with
a
*NL*
disheveled
beard
,
little
,
and
dreadful
looking
.
I
wanted
to
run
away
,
*NL*
but
he
bent
down
over
a
sack
,
and
was
fumbling
there
with
his
hands
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
showed
how
he
had
moved
his
hands
.
There
was
terror
in
her
face
.
And
*NL*
Vronsky
,
remembering
his
dream
,
felt
the
same
terror
filling
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
fumbling
and
kept
talking
quickly
,
quickly
in
French
,
you
know
:
*NL*
_
Il
faut
le
battre
,
le
fer
,
le
brayer
,
le
petrir
_
...
And
in
my
horror
I
*NL*
tried
to
wake
up
,
and
woke
up
...
but
woke
up
in
the
dream
.
And
I
began
*NL*
asking
myself
what
it
meant
.
And
Korney
said
to
me
:
`
In
childbirth
*NL*
you
'll
die
,
ma'am
,
you
'll
die
...
'
And
I
woke
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
what
nonsense
!
''
said
Vronsky
;
but
he
felt
himself
that
*NL*
there
was
no
conviction
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
let
's
talk
of
it
.
Ring
the
bell
,
I
'll
have
tea
.
And
stay
a
*NL*
little
now
;
it
's
not
long
I
shall
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
at
once
she
stopped
.
The
expression
of
her
face
instantaneously
*NL*
changed
.
Horror
and
excitement
were
suddenly
replaced
by
a
look
of
soft
,
*NL*
solemn
,
blissful
attention
.
He
could
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
change
.
She
was
listening
to
the
stirring
of
the
new
life
within
her
.

Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
after
meeting
Vronsky
on
his
own
steps
,
drove
,
as
*NL*
he
had
intended
,
to
the
Italian
opera
.
He
sat
through
two
acts
there
,
*NL*
and
saw
everyone
he
had
wanted
to
see
.
On
returning
home
,
he
carefully
*NL*
scrutinized
the
hat
stand
,
and
noticing
that
there
was
not
a
military
*NL*
overcoat
there
,
he
went
,
as
usual
,
to
his
own
room
.
But
,
contrary
to
his
*NL*
usual
habit
,
he
did
not
go
to
bed
,
he
walked
up
and
down
his
study
till
*NL*
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
feeling
of
furious
anger
with
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
would
not
observe
the
proprieties
and
keep
to
the
one
*NL*
stipulation
he
had
laid
on
her
,
not
to
receive
her
lover
in
her
own
*NL*
home
,
gave
him
no
peace
.
She
had
not
complied
with
his
request
,
and
he
*NL*
was
bound
to
punish
her
and
carry
out
his
threat
--
obtain
a
divorce
and
*NL*
take
away
his
son
.
He
knew
all
the
difficulties
connected
with
this
*NL*
course
,
but
he
had
said
he
would
do
it
,
and
now
he
must
carry
out
his
*NL*
threat
.
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
hinted
that
this
was
the
best
way
*NL*
out
of
his
position
,
and
of
late
the
obtaining
of
divorces
had
been
*NL*
brought
to
such
perfection
that
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
a
possibility
*NL*
of
overcoming
the
formal
difficulties
.
Misfortunes
never
come
singly
,
*NL*
and
the
affairs
of
the
reorganization
of
the
native
tribes
,
and
of
the
*NL*
irrigation
of
the
lands
of
the
Zaraisky
province
,
had
brought
such
*NL*
official
worries
upon
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
that
he
had
been
of
late
in
*NL*
a
continual
condition
of
extreme
irritability
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
sleep
the
whole
night
,
and
his
fury
,
growing
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
vast
,
arithmetical
progression
,
reached
its
highest
limits
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
He
dressed
in
haste
,
and
as
though
carrying
his
cup
full
of
*NL*
wrath
,
and
fearing
to
spill
any
over
,
fearing
to
lose
with
his
wrath
the
*NL*
energy
necessary
for
the
interview
with
his
wife
,
he
went
into
her
room
*NL*
directly
he
heard
she
was
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
who
had
thought
she
knew
her
husband
so
well
,
was
amazed
at
his
*NL*
appearance
when
he
went
in
to
her
.
His
brow
was
lowering
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
stared
darkly
before
him
,
avoiding
her
eyes
;
his
mouth
was
tightly
and
*NL*
contemptuously
shut
.
In
his
walk
,
in
his
gestures
,
in
the
sound
of
his
*NL*
voice
there
was
a
determination
and
firmness
such
as
his
wife
had
never
*NL*
seen
in
him
.
He
went
into
her
room
,
and
without
greeting
her
,
walked
*NL*
straight
up
to
her
writing-table
,
and
taking
her
keys
,
opened
a
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
lover
's
letters
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
not
here
,
''
she
said
,
shutting
the
drawer
;
but
from
that
action
*NL*
he
saw
he
had
guessed
right
,
and
roughly
pushing
away
her
hand
,
he
*NL*
quickly
snatched
a
portfolio
in
which
he
knew
she
used
to
put
her
most
*NL*
important
papers
.
She
tried
to
pull
the
portfolio
away
,
but
he
pushed
*NL*
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
!
I
have
to
speak
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
putting
the
portfolio
under
*NL*
his
arm
,
and
squeezing
it
so
tightly
with
his
elbow
that
his
shoulder
*NL*
stood
up
.
Amazed
and
intimidated
,
she
gazed
at
him
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
that
I
would
not
allow
you
to
receive
your
lover
in
this
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
to
see
him
to
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
,
not
finding
a
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
enter
into
the
details
of
why
a
woman
wants
to
see
her
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
,
I
only
...
''
she
said
,
flushing
hotly
.
This
coarseness
of
his
*NL*
angered
her
,
and
gave
her
courage
.
``
Surely
you
must
feel
how
easy
it
is
*NL*
for
you
to
insult
me
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
honest
man
and
an
honest
woman
may
be
insulted
,
but
to
tell
a
thief
*NL*
he
's
a
thief
is
simply
_
la
constatation
d'un
fait
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
cruelty
is
something
new
I
did
not
know
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
call
it
cruelty
for
a
husband
to
give
his
wife
liberty
,
giving
her
*NL*
the
honorable
protection
of
his
name
,
simply
on
the
condition
of
*NL*
observing
the
proprieties
:
is
that
cruelty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
worse
than
cruel
--
it
's
base
,
if
you
want
to
know
!
''
Anna
cried
,
in
*NL*
a
rush
of
hatred
,
and
getting
up
,
she
was
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
he
shrieked
,
in
his
shrill
voice
,
which
pitched
a
note
higher
than
*NL*
usual
even
,
and
his
big
hands
clutching
her
by
the
arm
so
violently
that
*NL*
red
marks
were
left
from
the
bracelet
he
was
squeezing
,
he
forcibly
sat
*NL*
her
down
in
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Base
!
If
you
care
to
use
that
word
,
what
is
base
is
to
forsake
husband
*NL*
and
child
for
a
lover
,
while
you
eat
your
husband
's
bread
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
.
She
did
not
say
what
she
had
said
the
evening
before
*NL*
to
her
lover
,
that
_
he
_
was
her
husband
,
and
her
husband
was
*NL*
superfluous
;
she
did
not
even
think
that
.
She
felt
all
the
justice
of
*NL*
his
words
,
and
only
said
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
describe
my
position
as
worse
than
I
feel
it
to
be
myself
;
*NL*
but
what
are
you
saying
all
this
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
saying
it
for
?
what
for
?
''
he
went
on
,
as
angrily
.
``
That
you
*NL*
may
know
that
since
you
have
not
carried
out
my
wishes
in
regard
to
*NL*
observing
outward
decorum
,
I
will
take
measures
to
put
an
end
to
this
*NL*
state
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
,
very
soon
,
it
will
end
,
anyway

''
she
said
;
and
again
,
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
death
near
at
hand
and
now
desired
,
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
end
sooner
than
you

your

have
planned

you
must
*NL*
have
the
satisfaction

animal
passion

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch

I
wo
n't

it
's
not
generous

strike
anyone
who
's
down

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
only

But

no
interest

You
do

life
is
ruined

that

thuff

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
speaking
so
quickly
that
he
stammered
,
and
was
*NL*
utterly
unable
to
articulate
the
word
``
suffering
.
''
In
the
end
he
*NL*
pronounced
it
``
thuffering
.
''
She
wanted
to
laugh
,
and
was
immediately
*NL*
ashamed
that
anything
could
amuse
her
at
such
a
moment
.
And
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
for
an
instant
,
she
felt
for
him
,
put
herself
in
his
place
,
*NL*
and
was
sorry
for
him
.
But
what
could
she
say
or
do
?
Her
head
sank
,
and
*NL*
she
sat
silent
.
He
too
was
silent
for
some
time
,
and
then
began
speaking
*NL*
in
a
frigid
,
less
shrill
voice
,
emphasizing
random
words
that
had
no
*NL*
special
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
tell
you
...
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
him
.
``
No
,
it
was
my
fancy
,
''
she
thought
,
recalling
the
*NL*
expression
of
his
face
when
he
stumbled
over
the
word
``
suffering
.
''
``
No
;
*NL*
can
a
man
with
those
dull
eyes

with
that
self-satisfied
complacency

feel
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
change
anything

she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
come

said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
with
an
effort
recalling
what
he
had
meant
to
say
about
*NL*
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
Seryozha
to

she
said
,
looking
at
him
from
under
her
*NL*
brows
.
``
You
do
not
love
him
...
Leave
me
Seryozha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
lost
even
my
affection
for
my
son
,
because
he
is
associated
*NL*
with
the
repulsion
I
feel
for
you
.
But
still
I
shall
take
him
.
Goodbye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
going
away
,
but
now
she
detained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
leave
me
Seryozha
!
''
she
whispered
once
more
.
``
I
*NL*
have
nothing
else
to
say
.
Leave
Seryozha
till
my
...
I
shall
soon
be
*NL*
confined
;
leave
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
flew
into
a
rage
,
and
,
snatching
his
hand
from
*NL*
her
,
he
went
out
of
the
room
without
a
word
.

Chapter
5
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiting-room
of
the
celebrated
Petersburg
lawyer
was
full
when
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
entered
it
.
Three
ladies
--
an
old
lady
,
a
young
*NL*
lady
,
and
a
merchant
's
wife
--
and
three
gentlemen
--
one
a
German
banker
*NL*
with
a
ring
on
his
finger
,
the
second
a
merchant
with
a
beard
,
and
the
*NL*
third
a
wrathful-looking
government
clerk
in
official
uniform
,
with
a
*NL*
cross
on
his
neck
--
had
obviously
been
waiting
a
long
while
already
.
Two
*NL*
clerks
were
writing
at
tables
with
scratching
pens
.
The
appurtenances
of
*NL*
the
writing-tables
,
about
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
himself
very
*NL*
fastidious
,
were
exceptionally
good
.
He
could
not
help
observing
this
.
*NL*
One
of
the
clerks
,
without
getting
up
,
turned
wrathfully
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
half
closing
his
eyes
.
``
What
are
you
wanting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
that
he
had
to
see
the
lawyer
on
some
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
engaged
,
''
the
clerk
responded
severely
,
and
he
pointed
with
his
*NL*
pen
at
the
persons
waiting
,
and
went
on
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
he
spare
time
to
see
me
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
no
time
free
;
he
is
always
busy
.
Kindly
wait
your
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
must
trouble
you
to
give
him
my
card
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
said
with
dignity
,
seeing
the
impossibility
of
preserving
his
incognito
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
took
the
card
and
,
obviously
not
approving
of
what
he
read
on
*NL*
it
,
went
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
in
principle
in
favor
of
the
publicity
of
*NL*
legal
proceedings
,
though
for
some
higher
official
considerations
he
*NL*
disliked
the
application
of
the
principle
in
Russia
,
and
disapproved
of
*NL*
it
,
as
far
as
he
could
disapprove
of
anything
instituted
by
authority
of
*NL*
the
Emperor
.
His
whole
life
had
been
spent
in
administrative
work
,
and
*NL*
consequently
,
when
he
did
not
approve
of
anything
,
his
disapproval
was
*NL*
softened
by
the
recognition
of
the
inevitability
of
mistakes
and
the
*NL*
possibility
of
reform
in
every
department
.
In
the
new
public
law
courts
*NL*
he
disliked
the
restrictions
laid
on
the
lawyers
conducting
cases
.
But
*NL*
till
then
he
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
courts
,
and
so
had
*NL*
disapproved
of
their
publicity
simply
in
theory
;
now
his
disapprobation
*NL*
was
strengthened
by
the
unpleasant
impression
made
on
him
in
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
waiting
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
immediately
,
''
said
the
clerk
;
and
two
minutes
later
there
did
*NL*
actually
appear
in
the
doorway
the
large
figure
of
an
old
solicitor
who
*NL*
had
been
consulting
with
the
lawyer
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
was
a
little
,
squat
,
bald
man
,
with
a
dark
,
reddish
beard
,
*NL*
light-colored
long
eyebrows
,
and
an
overhanging
brow
.
He
was
attired
as
*NL*
though
for
a
wedding
,
from
his
cravat
to
his
double
watch-chain
and
*NL*
varnished
boots
.
His
face
was
clever
and
manly
,
but
his
dress
was
*NL*
dandified
and
in
bad
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
walk
in
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
addressing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
and
,
*NL*
gloomily
ushering
Karenin
in
before
him
,
he
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
?
''
He
indicated
an
armchair
at
a
writing
table
*NL*
covered
with
papers
.
He
sat
down
himself
,
and
,
rubbing
his
little
hands
*NL*
with
short
fingers
covered
with
white
hairs
,
he
bent
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
.
But
as
soon
as
he
was
settled
in
this
position
a
moth
flew
over
*NL*
the
table
.
The
lawyer
,
with
a
swiftness
that
could
never
have
been
*NL*
expected
of
him
,
opened
his
hands
,
caught
the
moth
,
and
resumed
his
*NL*
former
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
beginning
to
speak
of
my
business
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
following
the
lawyer
's
movements
with
wondering
eyes
,
``
I
ought
to
*NL*
observe
that
the
business
about
which
I
have
to
speak
to
you
is
to
be
*NL*
strictly
private
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
's
overhanging
reddish
mustaches
were
parted
in
a
scarcely
*NL*
perceptible
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
be
a
lawyer
if
I
could
not
keep
the
secrets
confided
to
*NL*
me
.
But
if
you
would
like
proof
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
glanced
at
his
face
,
and
saw
that
the
shrewd
,
gray
*NL*
eyes
were
laughing
,
and
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
my
name
?
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
and
the
good
''
--
again
he
caught
a
moth
--
``
work
you
are
doing
,
*NL*
like
every
Russian
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
bowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sighed
,
plucking
up
his
courage
.
But
having
once
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
he
went
on
in
his
shrill
voice
,
without
timidity
--
or
*NL*
hesitation
,
accentuating
here
and
there
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
misfortune
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
began
,
``
to
have
been
*NL*
deceived
in
my
married
life
,
and
I
desire
to
break
off
all
relations
*NL*
with
my
wife
by
legal
means
--
that
is
,
to
be
divorced
,
but
to
do
this
so
*NL*
that
my
son
may
not
remain
with
his
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
's
gray
eyes
tried
not
to
laugh
,
but
they
were
dancing
with
*NL*
irrepressible
glee
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
that
it
was
not
simply
*NL*
the
delight
of
a
man
who
has
just
got
a
profitable
job
:
there
was
*NL*
triumph
and
joy
,
there
was
a
gleam
like
the
malignant
gleam
he
saw
in
*NL*
his
wife
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
desire
my
assistance
in
securing
a
divorce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
precisely
so
;
but
I
ought
to
warn
you
that
I
may
be
wasting
your
*NL*
time
and
attention
.
I
have
come
simply
to
consult
you
as
a
preliminary
*NL*
step
.
I
want
a
divorce
,
but
the
form
in
which
it
is
possible
is
of
great
*NL*
consequence
to
me
.
It
is
very
possible
that
if
that
form
does
not
*NL*
correspond
with
my
requirements
I
may
give
up
a
legal
divorce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
always
the
case
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
and
that
's
always
for
*NL*
you
to
decide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
his
eyes
rest
on
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
feet
,
feeling
that
he
*NL*
might
offend
his
client
by
the
sight
of
his
irrepressible
amusement
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
a
moth
that
flew
before
his
nose
,
and
moved
his
hands
,
but
did
*NL*
not
catch
it
from
regard
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
in
their
general
features
our
laws
on
this
subject
are
known
to
*NL*
me
,
''
pursued
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
``
I
should
be
glad
to
have
an
idea
of
*NL*
the
forms
in
which
such
things
are
done
in
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
be
glad
,
''
the
lawyer
,
without
lifting
his
eyes
,
responded
,
*NL*
adopting
,
with
a
certain
satisfaction
,
the
tone
of
his
client
's
remarks
,
*NL*
``
for
me
to
lay
before
you
all
the
methods
by
which
you
could
secure
what
*NL*
you
desire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
receiving
an
assuring
nod
from
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
he
went
on
,
*NL*
stealing
a
glance
now
and
then
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
face
,
which
*NL*
was
growing
red
in
patches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Divorce
by
our
laws
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
slight
shade
of
disapprobation
of
*NL*
our
laws
,
``
is
possible
,
as
you
are
aware
,
in
the
following
cases
...
*NL*
Wait
a
little
!
''
he
called
to
a
clerk
who
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
,
*NL*
but
he
got
up
all
the
same
,
said
a
few
words
to
him
,
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
''
...
In
the
following
cases
:
physical
defect
in
the
married
parties
,
*NL*
desertion
without
communication
for
five
years
,
''
he
said
,
crooking
a
*NL*
short
finger
covered
with
hair
,
``
adultery
''
-LRB-
this
word
he
pronounced
with
*NL*
obvious
satisfaction
-RRB-
,
``
subdivided
as
follows
''
-LRB-
he
continued
to
crook
*NL*
his
fat
fingers
,
though
the
three
cases
and
their
subdivisions
could
*NL*
obviously
not
be
classified
together
-RRB-
:
``
physical
defect
of
the
husband
*NL*
or
of
the
wife
,
adultery
of
the
husband
or
of
the
wife
.
''
As
by
now
all
*NL*
his
fingers
were
used
up
,
he
uncrooked
all
his
fingers
and
went
on
:
*NL*
``
This
is
the
theoretical
view
;
but
I
imagine
you
have
done
me
the
honor
*NL*
to
apply
to
me
in
order
to
learn
its
application
in
practice
.
And
*NL*
therefore
,
guided
by
precedents
,
I
must
inform
you
that
in
practice
*NL*
cases
of
divorce
may
all
be
reduced
to
the
following
--
there
's
no
*NL*
physical
defect
,
I
may
assume
,
nor
desertion
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
bowed
his
head
in
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
May
be
reduced
to
the
following
:
adultery
of
one
of
the
married
*NL*
parties
,
and
the
detection
in
the
fact
of
the
guilty
party
by
mutual
*NL*
agreement
,
and
failing
such
agreement
,
accidental
detection
.
It
must
be
*NL*
admitted
that
the
latter
case
is
rarely
met
with
in
practice
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
and
stealing
a
glance
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
he
paused
,
as
a
*NL*
man
selling
pistols
,
after
enlarging
on
the
advantages
of
each
weapon
,
*NL*
might
await
his
customer
's
choice
.
But
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
*NL*
nothing
,
and
therefore
the
lawyer
went
on
:
``
The
most
usual
and
simple
,
*NL*
the
sensible
course
,
I
consider
,
is
adultery
by
mutual
consent
.
I
should
*NL*
not
permit
myself
to
express
it
so
,
speaking
with
a
man
of
no
*NL*
education
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
imagine
that
to
you
this
is
comprehensible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
,
however
,
so
perturbed
that
he
did
not
*NL*
immediately
comprehend
all
the
good
sense
of
adultery
by
mutual
consent
,
*NL*
and
his
eyes
expressed
this
uncertainty
;
but
the
lawyer
promptly
came
to
*NL*
his
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
can
not
go
on
living
together
--
here
you
have
a
fact
.
And
if
both
*NL*
are
agreed
about
it
,
the
details
and
formalities
become
a
matter
of
no
*NL*
importance
.
And
at
the
same
time
this
is
the
simplest
and
most
certain
*NL*
method
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
fully
understood
now
.
But
he
had
religious
*NL*
scruples
,
which
hindered
the
execution
of
such
a
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
out
of
the
question
in
the
present
case
,
''
he
said
.
``
Only
one
*NL*
alternative
is
possible
:
undesigned
detection
,
supported
by
letters
*NL*
which
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
mention
of
letters
the
lawyer
pursed
up
his
lips
,
and
gave
*NL*
utterance
to
a
thin
little
compassionate
and
contemptuous
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
consider
,
''
he
began
,
``
cases
of
that
kind
are
,
as
you
are
aware
,
*NL*
under
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
;
the
reverend
fathers
are
fond
of
*NL*
going
into
the
minutest
details
in
cases
of
that
kind
,
''
he
said
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
which
betrayed
his
sympathy
with
the
reverend
fathers
'
taste
.
*NL*
``
Letters
may
,
of
course
,
be
a
partial
confirmation
;
but
detection
in
the
*NL*
fact
there
must
be
of
the
most
direct
kind
,
that
is
,
by
eyewitnesses
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
if
you
do
me
the
honor
to
intrust
your
confidence
to
me
,
you
will
*NL*
do
well
to
leave
me
the
choice
of
the
measures
to
be
employed
.
If
one
*NL*
wants
the
result
,
one
must
admit
the
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
so
...
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
began
,
suddenly
turning
white
;
*NL*
but
at
that
moment
the
lawyer
rose
and
again
went
to
the
door
to
speak
*NL*
to
the
intruding
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
we
do
n't
haggle
over
fees
!
''
he
said
,
and
returned
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
back
he
caught
unobserved
another
moth
.
``
Nice
state
my
rep
*NL*
curtains
will
be
in
by
the
summer
!
''
he
thought
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
were
saying
?
...
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
communicate
my
decision
to
you
by
letter
,
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
getting
up
,
and
he
clutched
at
the
table
.
After
standing
*NL*
a
moment
in
silence
,
he
said
:
``
From
your
words
I
may
consequently
*NL*
conclude
that
a
divorce
may
be
obtained
?
I
would
ask
you
to
let
me
know
*NL*
what
are
your
terms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
obtained
if
you
give
me
complete
liberty
of
action
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
not
answering
his
question
.
``
When
can
I

information

you

he
asked
,
moving
towards
the
door
,
his
eyes
and
*NL*
his
varnished
boots
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
week
's

Your
answer
as
to
whether
you

good

communicate

*NL*
``
Very

The
lawyer
bowed
respectfully
,
let
his
client
out
of
the
door
,
and
,
left
*NL*
alone
,
gave
himself
up
to
his
sense
of
amusement

He
felt
so
mirthful
*NL*
that
,
contrary
to
his
rules
,
he
made
a
reduction
in
his
terms
to
the
*NL*
haggling
lady

gave
up

deciding

Chapter
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
gained
a
brilliant
victory
at
the
sitting
of
*NL*
the
Commission
of
the
17th
of
August
,
but
in
the
sequel
this
victory
cut
*NL*
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
.
The
new
commission
for
the
inquiry
into
*NL*
the
condition
of
the
native
tribes
in
all
its
branches
had
been
formed
*NL*
and
despatched
to
its
destination
with
an
unusual
speed
and
energy
*NL*
inspired
by
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
Within
three
months
a
report
was
*NL*
presented
.
The
condition
of
the
native
tribes
was
investigated
in
its
*NL*
political
,
administrative
,
economic
,
ethnographic
,
material
,
and
*NL*
religious
aspects
.
To
all
these
questions
there
were
answers
admirably
*NL*
stated
,
and
answers
admitting
no
shade
of
doubt
,
since
they
were
not
a
*NL*
product
of
human
thought
,
always
liable
to
error
,
but
were
all
the
*NL*
product
of
official
activity
.
The
answers
were
all
based
on
official
*NL*
data
furnished
by
governors
and
heads
of
churches
,
and
founded
on
the
*NL*
reports
of
district
magistrates
and
ecclesiastical
superintendents
,
*NL*
founded
in
their
turn
on
the
reports
of
parochial
overseers
and
parish
*NL*
priests
;
and
so
all
of
these
answers
were
unhesitating
and
certain
.
All
*NL*
such
questions
as
,
for
instance
,
of
the
cause
of
failure
of
crops
,
of
*NL*
the
adherence
of
certain
tribes
to
their
ancient
beliefs
,
*NL*
etc.
--
questions
which
,
but
for
the
convenient
intervention
of
the
*NL*
official
machine
,
are
not
,
and
can
not
be
solved
for
ages
--
received
full
,
*NL*
unhesitating
solution
.
And
this
solution
was
in
favor
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
contention
.
But
Stremov
,
who
had
felt
stung
to
the
*NL*
quick
at
the
last
sitting
,
had
,
on
the
reception
of
the
commission
's
*NL*
report
,
resorted
to
tactics
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
not
*NL*
anticipated
.
Stremov
,
carrying
with
him
several
members
,
went
over
to
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
side
,
and
not
contenting
himself
with
warmly
*NL*
defending
the
measure
proposed
by
Karenin
,
proposed
other
more
extreme
*NL*
measures
in
the
same
direction
.
These
measures
,
still
further
*NL*
exaggerated
in
opposition
to
what
was
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
*NL*
fundamental
idea
,
were
passed
by
the
commission
,
and
then
the
aim
of
*NL*
Stremov
's
tactics
became
apparent
.
Carried
to
an
extreme
,
the
measures
*NL*
seemed
at
once
to
be
so
absurd
that
the
highest
authorities
,
and
public
*NL*
opinion
,
and
intellectual
ladies
,
and
the
newspapers
,
all
at
the
same
*NL*
time
fell
foul
of
them
,
expressing
their
indignation
both
with
the
*NL*
measures
and
their
nominal
father
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
Stremov
drew
*NL*
back
,
affecting
to
have
blindly
followed
Karenin
,
and
to
be
astounded
*NL*
and
distressed
at
what
had
been
done
.
This
meant
the
defeat
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
But
in
spite
of
failing
health
,
in
spite
of
his
domestic
*NL*
griefs
,
he
did
not
give
in
.
There
was
a
split
in
the
commission
.
Some
*NL*
members
,
with
Stremov
at
their
head
,
justified
their
mistake
on
the
*NL*
ground
that
they
had
put
faith
in
the
commission
of
revision
,
instituted
*NL*
by
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
maintained
that
the
report
of
the
*NL*
commission
was
rubbish
,
and
simply
so
much
waste
paper
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
with
a
following
of
those
who
saw
the
danger
of
so
*NL*
revolutionary
an
attitude
to
official
documents
,
persisted
in
upholding
*NL*
the
statements
obtained
by
the
revising
commission
.
In
consequence
of
*NL*
this
,
in
the
higher
spheres
,
and
even
in
society
,
all
was
chaos
,
and
*NL*
although
everyone
was
interested
,
no
one
could
tell
whether
the
native
*NL*
tribes
really
were
becoming
impoverished
and
ruined
,
or
whether
they
*NL*
were
in
a
flourishing
condition
.
The
position
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
owing
to
this
,
and
partly
owing
to
the
contempt
lavished
on
him
for
his
*NL*
wife
's
infidelity
,
became
very
precarious
.
And
in
this
position
he
took
*NL*
an
important
resolution
.
To
the
astonishment
of
the
commission
,
he
*NL*
announced
that
he
should
ask
permission
to
go
himself
to
investigate
the
*NL*
question
on
the
spot
.
And
having
obtained
permission
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
prepared
to
set
off
to
these
remote
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
departure
made
a
great
sensation
,
the
more
so
as
*NL*
just
before
he
started
he
officially
returned
the
posting-fares
allowed
*NL*
him
for
twelve
horses
,
to
drive
to
his
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
very
noble
,
''
Betsy
said
about
this
to
the
Princess
Myakaya
.
*NL*
``
Why
take
money
for
posting-horses
when
everyone
knows
that
there
are
*NL*
railways
everywhere
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Princess
Myakaya
did
not
agree
,
and
the
Princess
Tverskaya
's
opinion
*NL*
annoyed
her
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
to
talk
,
''
said
she
,
``
when
you
have
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
many
millions
;
but
I
am
very
glad
when
my
husband
goes
on
a
*NL*
revising
tour
in
the
summer
.
It
's
very
good
for
him
and
pleasant
*NL*
traveling
about
,
and
it
's
a
settled
arrangement
for
me
to
keep
a
*NL*
carriage
and
coachman
on
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
to
the
remote
provinces
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stopped
for
*NL*
three
days
at
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
arrival
he
was
driving
back
from
calling
on
the
*NL*
governor-general
.
At
the
crossroads
by
Gazetoy
Place
,
where
there
are
*NL*
always
crowds
of
carriages
and
sledges
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
suddenly
*NL*
heard
his
name
called
out
in
such
a
loud
and
cheerful
voice
that
he
*NL*
could
not
help
looking
round
.
At
the
corner
of
the
pavement
,
in
a
short
,
*NL*
stylish
overcoat
and
a
low-crowned
fashionable
hat
,
jauntily
askew
,
with
*NL*
a
smile
that
showed
a
gleam
of
white
teeth
and
red
lips
,
stood
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
radiant
,
young
,
and
beaming
.
He
called
him
vigorously
and
*NL*
urgently
,
and
insisted
on
his
stopping
.
He
had
one
arm
on
the
window
of
*NL*
a
carriage
that
was
stopping
at
the
corner
,
and
out
of
the
window
were
*NL*
thrust
the
heads
of
a
lady
in
a
velvet
hat
,
and
two
children
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
smiling
and
beckoning
to
his
brother-in-law
.
The
lady
*NL*
smiled
a
kindly
smile
too
,
and
she
too
waved
her
hand
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
It
was
Dolly
with
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
want
to
see
anyone
in
Moscow
,
and
least
of
*NL*
all
his
wife
's
brother
.
He
raised
his
hat
and
would
have
driven
on
,
but
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
told
his
coachman
to
stop
,
and
ran
across
the
snow
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
a
shame
not
to
have
let
us
know
!
Been
here
long
?
I
was
at
*NL*
Dussot
's
yesterday
and
saw
`
Karenin
'
on
the
visitors
'
list
,
but
it
never
*NL*
entered
my
head
that
it
was
you
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
sticking
his
*NL*
head
in
at
the
window
of
the
carriage
,
``
or
I
should
have
looked
you
up
.
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
see
you
!
''
he
said
,
knocking
one
foot
against
the
other
to
*NL*
shake
the
snow
off
.
``
What
a
shame
of
you
not
to
let
us
know
!
''
he
*NL*
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no
time
;
I
am
very
busy
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
responded
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
my
wife
,
she
does
so
want
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
unfolded
the
rug
in
which
his
frozen
feet
were
*NL*
wrapped
,
and
getting
out
of
his
carriage
made
his
way
over
the
snow
to
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
what
are
you
cutting
us
like
this
for
?
''
*NL*
said
Dolly
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
busy
.
Delighted
to
see
you
!
''
he
said
in
a
tone
clearly
*NL*
indicating
that
he
was
annoyed
by
it
.
``
How
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
how
is
my
darling
Anna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
mumbled
something
and
would
have
gone
on
.
But
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
tomorrow
.
Dolly
,
ask
him
to
dinner

We
'll
ask
*NL*
Koznishev
and
Pestsov
,
so
as
to
entertain
him
with
our
Moscow
*NL*
celebrities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
do
come

''
said
Dolly
;
``
we
will
expect
you
at
five

or
six
*NL*
o'clock

if
you
like

How

Anna
?
How
long
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
quite
well
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
mumbled
,
frowning
.
*NL*
``
Delighted
!
''
and
he
moved
away
towards
his
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
come
?
''
Dolly
called
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
something
which
Dolly
could
not
catch
in
the
*NL*
noise
of
the
moving
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
round
tomorrow
!
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
shouted
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
got
into
his
carriage
,
and
buried
himself
in
it
so
*NL*
as
neither
to
see
nor
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Queer
fish
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
to
his
wife
,
and
glancing
at
his
*NL*
watch
,
he
made
a
motion
of
his
hand
before
his
face
,
indicating
a
caress
*NL*
to
his
wife
and
children
,
and
walked
jauntily
along
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
!
Stiva
!
''
Dolly
called
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
get
coats
,
you
know
,
for
Grisha
and
Tanya
.
Give
me
the
money

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
you
tell
them
I
'll
pay
the
bill

''
and
he
vanished
,
nodding
*NL*
genially
to
an
acquaintance
who
drove
by
.

The
next
day
was
Sunday
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
to
the
Grand
Theater
*NL*
to
a
rehearsal
of
the
ballet
,
and
gave
Masha
Tchibisova
,
a
pretty
*NL*
dancing-girl
whom
he
had
just
taken
under
his
protection
,
the
coral
*NL*
necklace
he
had
promised
her
the
evening
before
,
and
behind
the
scenes
*NL*
in
the
dim
daylight
of
the
theater
,
managed
to
kiss
her
pretty
little
*NL*
face
,
radiant
over
her
present
.
Besides
the
gift
of
the
necklace
he
*NL*
wanted
to
arrange
with
her
about
meeting
after
the
ballet
.
After
*NL*
explaining
that
he
could
not
come
at
the
beginning
of
the
ballet
,
he
*NL*
promised
he
would
come
for
the
last
act
and
take
her
to
supper
.
From
the
*NL*
theater
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
drove
to
Ohotny
Row
,
selected
himself
the
*NL*
fish
and
asparagus
for
dinner
,
and
by
twelve
o'clock
was
at
Dussot
's
,
*NL*
where
he
had
to
see
three
people
,
luckily
all
staying
at
the
same
hotel
:
*NL*
Levin
,
who
had
recently
come
back
from
abroad
and
was
staying
there
;
the
*NL*
new
head
of
his
department
,
who
had
just
been
promoted
to
that
position
,
*NL*
and
had
come
on
a
tour
of
revision
to
Moscow
;
and
his
brother-in-law
,
*NL*
Karenin
,
whom
he
must
see
,
so
as
to
be
sure
of
bringing
him
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
liked
dining
,
but
still
better
he
liked
to
give
a
*NL*
dinner
,
small
,
but
very
choice
,
both
as
regards
the
food
and
drink
and
*NL*
as
regards
the
selection
of
guests
.
He
particularly
liked
the
program
of
*NL*
that
day
's
dinner
.
There
would
be
fresh
perch
,
asparagus
,
and
_
la
piece
*NL*
de
resistance
_
--
first-rate
,
but
quite
plain
,
roast
beef
,
and
wines
to
*NL*
suit
:
so
much
for
the
eating
and
drinking
.
Kitty
and
Levin
would
be
of
*NL*
the
party
,
and
that
this
might
not
be
obtrusively
evident
,
there
would
*NL*
be
a
girl
cousin
too
,
and
young
Shtcherbatsky
,
and
_
la
piece
de
*NL*
resistance
_
among
the
guests
--
Sergey
Koznishev
and
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
a
Moscow
man
,
and
a
philosopher
;
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
a
Petersburger
,
and
a
practical
politician
.
He
was
*NL*
asking
,
too
,
the
well-known
eccentric
enthusiast
,
Pestsov
,
a
liberal
,
a
*NL*
great
talker
,
a
musician
,
an
historian
,
and
the
most
delightfully
*NL*
youthful
person
of
fifty
,
who
would
be
a
sauce
or
garnish
for
Koznishev
*NL*
and
Karenin
.
He
would
provoke
them
and
set
them
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
installment
for
the
forest
had
been
received
from
the
*NL*
merchant
and
was
not
yet
exhausted
;
Dolly
had
been
very
amiable
and
*NL*
goodhumored
of
late
,
and
the
idea
of
the
dinner
pleased
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
from
every
point
of
view
.
He
was
in
the
most
light-hearted
*NL*
mood
.
There
were
two
circumstances
a
little
unpleasant
,
but
these
two
*NL*
circumstances
were
drowned
in
the
sea
of
good-humored
gaiety
which
*NL*
flooded
the
soul
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
These
two
circumstances
were
:
*NL*
first
,
that
on
meeting
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
the
day
before
in
the
*NL*
street
he
had
noticed
that
he
was
cold
and
reserved
with
him
,
and
*NL*
putting
the
expression
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
face
and
the
fact
that
*NL*
he
had
not
come
to
see
them
or
let
them
know
of
his
arrival
with
the
*NL*
rumors
he
had
heard
about
Anna
and
Vronsky
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
guessed
*NL*
that
something
was
wrong
between
the
husband
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
one
disagreeable
thing
.
The
other
slightly
disagreeable
fact
*NL*
was
that
the
new
head
of
his
department
,
like
all
new
heads
,
had
the
*NL*
reputation
already
of
a
terrible
person
,
who
got
up
at
six
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
worked
like
a
horse
,
and
insisted
on
his
subordinates
*NL*
working
in
the
same
way
.
Moreover
,
this
new
head
had
the
further
*NL*
reputation
of
being
a
bear
in
his
manners
,
and
was
,
according
to
all
*NL*
reports
,
a
man
of
a
class
in
all
respects
the
opposite
of
that
to
which
*NL*
his
predecessor
had
belonged
,
and
to
which
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
*NL*
hitherto
belonged
himself
.
On
the
previous
day
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
*NL*
appeared
at
the
office
in
a
uniform
,
and
the
new
chief
had
been
very
*NL*
affable
and
had
talked
to
him
as
to
an
acquaintance
.
Consequently
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
deemed
it
his
duty
to
call
upon
him
in
his
non-official
*NL*
dress
.
The
thought
that
the
new
chief
might
not
tender
him
a
warm
*NL*
reception
was
the
other
unpleasant
thing
.
But
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
instinctively
felt
that
everything
would
_
come
round
_
all
right
.
*NL*
``
They
're
all
people
,
all
men
,
like
us
poor
sinners
;
why
be
nasty
and
*NL*
quarrelsome
?
''
he
thought
as
he
went
into
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day
,
Vassily
,
''
he
said
,
walking
into
the
corridor
with
his
hat
*NL*
cocked
on
one
side
,
and
addressing
a
footman
he
knew
;
``
why
,
you
've
let
*NL*
your
whiskers
grow
!
Levin
,
number
seven
,
eh
?
Take
me
up
,
please
.
And
*NL*
find
out
whether
Count
Anitchkin
''
-LRB-
this
was
the
new
head
-RRB-
``
is
*NL*
receiving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
Vassily
responded
,
smiling
.
``
You
've
not
been
to
see
us
for
a
*NL*
long
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
here
yesterday
,
but
at
the
other
entrance
.
Is
this
number
seven
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
standing
with
a
peasant
from
Tver
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
*NL*
measuring
a
fresh
bearskin
,
when
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
killed
him
?
''
cried
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Well
done
!
A
*NL*
she-bear
?
How
are
you
,
Arhip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
hands
with
the
peasant
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
,
*NL*
without
taking
off
his
coat
and
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
take
off
your
coat
and
stay
a
little
,
''
said
Levin
,
taking
his
*NL*
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
time
;
I
've
only
looked
in
for
a
tiny
second
,
''
answered
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
He
threw
open
his
coat
,
but
afterwards
did
take
it
*NL*
off
,
and
sat
on
for
a
whole
hour
,
talking
to
Levin
about
hunting
and
the
*NL*
most
intimate
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
,
please
,
what
you
did
abroad
?
Where
have
you
been
?
''
said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
when
the
peasant
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
stayed
in
Germany
,
in
Prussia
,
in
France
,
and
in
England
--
not
in
*NL*
the
capitals
,
but
in
the
manufacturing
towns
,
and
saw
a
great
deal
that
*NL*
was
new
to
me
.
And
I
'm
glad
I
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
knew
your
idea
of
the
solution
of
the
labor
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
:
in
Russia
there
can
be
no
labor
question
.
In
Russia
the
*NL*
question
is
that
of
the
relation
of
the
working
people
to
the
land
;
*NL*
though
the
question
exists
there
too
--
but
there
it
's
a
matter
of
*NL*
repairing
what
's
been
ruined
,
while
with
us
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
listened
attentively
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
very
possible
you
're
right
.
But
I
'm
glad
*NL*
you
're
in
good
spirits
,
and
are
hunting
bears
,
and
working
,
and
*NL*
interested
.
Shtcherbatsky
told
me
another
story
--
he
met
you
--
that
you
*NL*
were
in
such
a
depressed
state
,
talking
of
nothing
but
death
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
of
it
?
I
've
not
given
up
thinking
of
death
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
``
It
's
true
that
it
's
high
time
I
was
dead
;
and
that
all
this
is
*NL*
nonsense
.
It
's
the
truth
I
'm
telling
you
.
I
do
value
my
idea
and
my
work
*NL*
awfully
;
but
in
reality
only
consider
this
:
all
this
world
of
ours
is
*NL*
nothing
but
a
speck
of
mildew
,
which
has
grown
up
on
a
tiny
planet
.
And
*NL*
for
us
to
suppose
we
can
have
something
great
--
ideas
,
work
--
it
's
all
*NL*
dust
and
ashes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
that
's
as
old
as
the
hills
,
my
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
old
;
but
do
you
know
,
when
you
grasp
this
fully
,
then
somehow
*NL*
everything
becomes
of
no
consequence
.
When
you
understand
that
you
will
*NL*
die
tomorrow
,
if
not
today
,
and
nothing
will
be
left
,
then
everything
is
*NL*
so
unimportant
!
And
I
consider
my
idea
very
important
,
but
it
turns
out
*NL*
really
to
be
as
unimportant
too
,
even
if
it
were
carried
out
,
as
doing
*NL*
for
that
bear
.
So
one
goes
on
living
,
amusing
oneself
with
hunting
,
with
*NL*
work
--
anything
so
as
not
to
think
of
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
a
subtle
affectionate
smile
as
he
listened
to
*NL*
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
course
!
Here
you
've
come
round
to
my
point
.
Do
you
remember
*NL*
you
attacked
me
for
seeking
enjoyment
in
life
?
Do
n't
be
so
severe
,
O
*NL*
moralist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
all
the
same
,
what
's
fine
in
life
is
...
''
Levin
hesitated
--
``
oh
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
.
All
I
know
is
that
we
shall
soon
be
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
,
there
's
less
charm
in
life
,
when
one
thinks
of
death
,
*NL*
but
there
's
more
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
the
finish
is
always
the
best
.
But
I
must
be
going
,
''
*NL*
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
getting
up
for
the
tenth
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
stay
a
bit
!
''
said
Levin
,
keeping
him
.
``
Now
,
when
shall
we
see
*NL*
each
other
again
?
I
'm
going
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
nice
person
!
Why
,
that
's
just
what
I
came
for
!
You
simply
must
*NL*
come
to
dinner
with
us
today
.
Your
brother
's
coming
,
and
Karenin
,
my
*NL*
brother-in-law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
he
's
here
?
''
said
Levin
,
and
he
wanted
to
inquire
*NL*
about
Kitty
.
He
had
heard
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
that
she
was
at
*NL*
Petersburg
with
her
sister
,
the
wife
of
the
diplomat
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
she
had
come
back
or
not
;
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
did
*NL*
not
ask
.
``
Whether
she
's
coming
or
not
,
I
do
n't
care
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
'll
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
five
o'clock
,
then
,
and
not
evening
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
got
up
and
went
down
below
to
the
new
head
of
*NL*
his
department
.
Instinct
had
not
misled
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
The
*NL*
terrible
new
head
turned
out
to
be
an
extremely
amenable
person
,
and
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
lunched
with
him
and
stayed
on
,
so
that
it
was
four
*NL*
o'clock
before
he
got
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
on
coming
back
from
church
service
,
had
spent
the
*NL*
whole
morning
indoors
.
He
had
two
pieces
of
business
before
him
that
*NL*
morning
;
first
,
to
receive
and
send
on
a
deputation
from
the
native
*NL*
tribes
which
was
on
its
way
to
Petersburg
,
and
now
at
Moscow
;
secondly
,
*NL*
to
write
the
promised
letter
to
the
lawyer
.
The
deputation
,
though
it
*NL*
had
been
summoned
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
instigation
,
was
not
*NL*
without
its
discomforting
and
even
dangerous
aspect
,
and
he
was
glad
he
*NL*
had
found
it
in
Moscow
.
The
members
of
this
deputation
had
not
the
*NL*
slightest
conception
of
their
duty
and
the
part
they
were
to
play
.
They
*NL*
naively
believed
that
it
was
their
business
to
lay
before
the
commission
*NL*
their
needs
and
the
actual
condition
of
things
,
and
to
ask
assistance
of
*NL*
the
government
,
and
utterly
failed
to
grasp
that
some
of
their
*NL*
statements
and
requests
supported
the
contention
of
the
enemy
's
side
,
*NL*
and
so
spoiled
the
whole
business
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
busily
*NL*
engaged
with
them
for
a
long
while
,
drew
up
a
program
for
them
from
*NL*
which
they
were
not
to
depart
,
and
on
dismissing
them
wrote
a
letter
to
*NL*
Petersburg
for
the
guidance
of
the
deputation
.
He
had
his
chief
support
*NL*
in
this
affair
in
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
She
was
a
specialist
in
*NL*
the
matter
of
deputations
,
and
no
one
knew
better
than
she
how
to
manage
*NL*
them
,
and
put
them
in
the
way
they
should
go
.
Having
completed
this
*NL*
task
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
wrote
the
letter
to
the
lawyer
.
Without
the
*NL*
slightest
hesitation
he
gave
him
permission
to
act
as
he
might
judge
*NL*
best
.
In
the
letter
he
enclosed
three
of
Vronsky
's
notes
to
Anna
,
which
*NL*
were
in
the
portfolio
he
had
taken
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
left
home
with
the
intention
of
not
*NL*
returning
to
his
family
again
,
and
since
he
had
been
at
the
lawyer
's
and
*NL*
had
spoken
,
though
only
to
one
man
,
of
his
intention
,
since
especially
*NL*
he
had
translated
the
matter
from
the
world
of
real
life
to
the
world
of
*NL*
ink
and
paper
,
he
had
grown
more
and
more
used
to
his
own
intention
,
and
*NL*
by
now
distinctly
perceived
the
feasibility
of
its
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sealing
the
envelope
to
the
lawyer
,
when
he
heard
the
loud
tones
*NL*
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
voice
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
disputing
with
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
servant
,
and
insisting
on
being
announced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
''
thought
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
``
so
much
the
better
.
I
will
*NL*
inform
him
at
once
of
my
position
in
regard
to
his
sister
,
and
explain
*NL*
why
it
is
I
ca
n't
dine
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
he
said
aloud
,
collecting
his
papers
,
and
putting
them
in
the
*NL*
blotting-paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
you
're
talking
nonsense
,
and
he
's
at
home
!
''
responded
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
voice
,
addressing
the
servant
,
who
had
refused
to
*NL*
let
him
in
,
and
taking
off
his
coat
as
he
went
,
Oblonsky
walked
into
the
*NL*
room
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
awfully
glad
I
've
found
you
!
So
I
hope
...
''
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
began
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
come
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
coldly
,
standing
and
not
*NL*
asking
his
visitor
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
thought
to
pass
at
once
into
those
frigid
*NL*
relations
in
which
he
ought
to
stand
with
the
brother
of
a
wife
against
*NL*
whom
he
was
beginning
a
suit
for
divorce
.
But
he
had
not
taken
into
*NL*
account
the
ocean
of
kindliness
brimming
over
in
the
heart
of
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
opened
wide
his
clear
,
shining
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
you
?
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
in
perplexity
,
speaking
in
*NL*
French
.
``
Oh
,
but
it
's
a
promise
.
And
we
're
all
counting
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
tell
you
that
I
ca
n't
dine
at
your
house
,
because
the
terms
*NL*
of
relationship
which
have
existed
between
us
must
cease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
How
do
you
mean
?
What
for
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
am
beginning
an
action
for
divorce
against
your
sister
,
my
*NL*
wife
.
I
ought
to
have
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
before
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
time
to
finish
his
sentence
,
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
behaving
not
at
all
as
he
had
expected
.
He
*NL*
groaned
and
sank
into
an
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
What
are
you
saying
?
''
cried
Oblonsky
,
and
*NL*
his
suffering
was
apparent
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
I
ca
n't
,
I
ca
n't
believe
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sat
down
,
feeling
that
his
words
had
not
had
the
*NL*
effect
he
anticipated
,
and
that
it
would
be
unavoidable
for
him
to
*NL*
explain
his
position
,
and
that
,
whatever
explanations
he
might
make
,
his
*NL*
relations
with
his
brother-in-law
would
remain
unchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
brought
to
the
painful
necessity
of
seeking
a
divorce
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
say
one
thing
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
I
know
you
for
an
*NL*
excellent
,
upright
man
;
I
know
Anna
--
excuse
me
,
I
ca
n't
change
my
*NL*
opinion
of
her
--
for
a
good
,
an
excellent
woman
;
and
so
,
excuse
me
,
I
*NL*
can
not
believe
it
.
There
is
some
misunderstanding
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
it
were
merely
a
misunderstanding
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
I
understand
,
''
interposed
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
But
of
*NL*
course
...
One
thing
:
you
must
not
act
in
haste
.
You
must
not
,
you
must
*NL*
not
act
in
haste
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
acting
in
haste
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
coldly
,
``
but
one
*NL*
can
not
ask
advice
of
anyone
in
such
a
matter
.
I
have
quite
made
up
my
*NL*
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
awful
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
I
would
do
one
thing
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
I
beseech
you
,
do
it
!
''
he
said
.
``
No
action
has
yet
been
*NL*
taken
,
if
I
understand
rightly
.
Before
you
take
advice
,
see
my
wife
,
*NL*
talk
to
her
.
She
loves
Anna
like
a
sister
,
she
loves
you
,
and
she
's
a
*NL*
wonderful
woman
.
For
God
's
sake
,
talk
to
her
!
Do
me
that
favor
,
I
*NL*
beseech
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
pondered
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
looked
at
him
*NL*
sympathetically
,
without
interrupting
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
go
to
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
That
was
just
why
I
have
not
been
to
see
you
.
I
imagine
*NL*
our
relations
must
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
I
do
n't
see
that
.
Allow
me
to
believe
that
apart
from
our
*NL*
connection
you
have
for
me
,
at
least
in
part
,
the
same
friendly
feeling
*NL*
I
have
always
had
for
you
...
and
sincere
esteem
,
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
pressing
his
hand
.
``
Even
if
your
worst
suppositions
were
*NL*
correct
,
I
do
n't
--
and
never
would
--
take
on
myself
to
judge
either
side
,
*NL*
and
I
see
no
reason
why
our
relations
should
be
affected
.
But
now
,
do
*NL*
this
,
come
and
see
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
look
at
the
matter
differently
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
coldly
.
``
However
,
we
wo
n't
discuss
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
why
should
n't
you
come
today
to
dine
,
anyway
?
My
wife
's
expecting
*NL*
you
.
Please
,
do
come
.
And
,
above
all
,
talk
it
over
with
her
.
She
's
a
*NL*
wonderful
woman
.
For
God
's
sake
,
on
my
knees
,
I
implore
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
so
much
wish
it
,
I
will
come
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
anxious
to
change
the
conversation
,
he
inquired
about
what
*NL*
interested
them
both
--
the
new
head
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
department
,
*NL*
a
man
not
yet
old
,
who
had
suddenly
been
promoted
to
so
high
a
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
previously
felt
no
liking
for
Count
Anitchkin
,
*NL*
and
had
always
differed
from
him
in
his
opinions
.
But
now
,
from
a
*NL*
feeling
readily
comprehensible
to
officials
--
that
hatred
felt
by
one
who
*NL*
has
suffered
a
defeat
in
the
service
for
one
who
has
received
a
*NL*
promotion
,
he
could
not
endure
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
you
seen
him
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
with
a
malignant
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
he
was
at
our
sitting
yesterday
.
He
seems
to
know
his
work
*NL*
capitally
,
and
to
be
very
energetic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
what
is
his
energy
directed
to
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
``
Is
he
aiming
at
doing
anything
,
or
simply
undoing
what
's
been
done
?
*NL*
It
's
the
great
misfortune
of
our
government
--
this
paper
administration
,
*NL*
of
which
he
's
a
worthy
representative
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
do
n't
know
what
fault
one
could
find
with
him
.
His
policy
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
,
but
one
thing
--
he
's
a
very
nice
fellow
,
''
answered
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
``
I
've
just
been
seeing
him
,
and
he
's
really
a
capital
*NL*
fellow
.
We
lunched
together
,
and
I
taught
him
how
to
make
,
you
know
that
*NL*
drink
,
wine
and
oranges
.
It
's
so
cooling
.
And
it
's
a
wonder
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
it
.
He
liked
it
awfully
.
No
,
really
he
's
a
capital
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
glanced
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
heavens
,
it
's
four
already
,
and
I
've
still
to
go
to
*NL*
Dolgovushin
's
!
So
please
come
round
to
dinner
.
You
ca
n't
imagine
how
you
*NL*
will
grieve
my
wife
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
in
which
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
saw
his
brother-in-law
out
was
*NL*
very
different
from
the
manner
in
which
he
had
met
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
promised
,
and
I
'll
come
,
''
he
answered
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
I
appreciate
it
,
and
I
hope
you
wo
n't
regret
it
,
''
answered
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
went
,
he
patted
the
footman
on
the
head
,
*NL*
chuckled
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
five
o'clock
,
and
not
evening
dress
,
please

he
shouted
once
more
,
*NL*
turning
at
the
door
.

Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
five
,
and
several
guests
had
already
arrived
,
before
the
*NL*
host
himself
got
home
.
He
went
in
together
with
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
Koznishev
and
Pestsov
,
who
had
reached
the
street
door
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
These
were
the
two
leading
representatives
of
the
Moscow
*NL*
intellectuals
,
as
Oblonsky
had
called
them
.
Both
were
men
respected
for
*NL*
their
character
and
their
intelligence
.
They
respected
each
other
,
but
*NL*
were
in
complete
and
hopeless
disagreement
upon
almost
every
subject
,
*NL*
not
because
they
belonged
to
opposite
parties
,
but
precisely
because
*NL*
they
were
of
the
same
party
-LRB-
their
enemies
refused
to
see
any
*NL*
distinction
between
their
views
-RRB-
;
but
,
in
that
party
,
each
had
his
own
*NL*
special
shade
of
opinion
.
And
since
no
difference
is
less
easily
*NL*
overcome
than
the
difference
of
opinion
about
semi-abstract
questions
,
*NL*
they
never
agreed
in
any
opinion
,
and
had
long
,
indeed
,
been
accustomed
*NL*
to
jeer
without
anger
,
each
at
the
other
's
incorrigible
aberrations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
just
going
in
at
the
door
,
talking
of
the
weather
,
when
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
overtook
them
.
In
the
drawing
room
there
were
already
*NL*
sitting
Prince
Alexander
Dmitrievitch
Shtcherbatsky
,
young
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
,
Turovtsin
,
Kitty
,
and
Karenin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
immediately
that
things
were
not
going
well
in
*NL*
the
drawing-room
without
him
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
in
her
best
gray
silk
*NL*
gown
,
obviously
worried
about
the
children
,
who
were
to
have
their
*NL*
dinner
by
themselves
in
the
nursery
,
and
by
her
husband
's
absence
,
was
*NL*
not
equal
to
the
task
of
making
the
party
mix
without
him
.
All
were
*NL*
sitting
like
so
many
priests
'
wives
on
a
visit
-LRB-
so
the
old
prince
*NL*
expressed
it
-RRB-
,
obviously
wondering
why
they
were
there
,
and
pumping
up
*NL*
remarks
simply
to
avoid
being
silent
.
Turovtsin
--
good
,
simple
man
--
felt
*NL*
unmistakably
a
fish
out
of
water
,
and
the
smile
with
which
his
thick
*NL*
lips
greeted
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
,
as
plainly
as
words
:
``
Well
,
old
*NL*
boy
,
you
have
popped
me
down
in
a
learned
set
!
A
drinking
party
now
,
or
*NL*
the
_
Chateau
des
Fleurs
_
,
would
be
more
in
my
line
!
''
The
old
prince
sat
*NL*
in
silence
,
his
bright
little
eyes
watching
Karenin
from
one
side
,
and
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
that
he
had
already
formed
a
phrase
to
sum
up
*NL*
that
politician
of
whom
guests
were
invited
to
partake
as
though
he
were
*NL*
a
sturgeon
.
Kitty
was
looking
at
the
door
,
calling
up
all
her
energies
*NL*
to
keep
her
from
blushing
at
the
entrance
of
Konstantin
Levin
.
Young
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
,
who
had
not
been
introduced
to
Karenin
,
was
trying
to
*NL*
look
as
though
he
were
not
in
the
least
conscious
of
it
.
Karenin
himself
*NL*
had
followed
the
Petersburg
fashion
for
a
dinner
with
ladies
and
was
*NL*
wearing
evening
dress
and
a
white
tie
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
by
his
*NL*
face
that
he
had
come
simply
to
keep
his
promise
,
and
was
performing
a
*NL*
disagreeable
duty
in
being
present
at
this
gathering
.
He
was
indeed
the
*NL*
person
chiefly
responsible
for
the
chill
benumbing
all
the
guests
before
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
drawing
room
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
apologized
,
explaining
*NL*
that
he
had
been
detained
by
that
prince
,
who
was
always
the
scapegoat
*NL*
for
all
his
absences
and
unpunctualities
,
and
in
one
moment
he
had
made
*NL*
all
the
guests
acquainted
with
each
other
,
and
,
bringing
together
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
and
Sergey
Koznishev
,
started
them
on
a
discussion
of
the
*NL*
Russification
of
Poland
,
into
which
they
immediately
plunged
with
*NL*
Pestsov
.
Slapping
Turovtsin
on
the
shoulder
,
he
whispered
something
*NL*
comic
in
his
ear
,
and
set
him
down
by
his
wife
and
the
old
prince
.
Then
*NL*
he
told
Kitty
she
was
looking
very
pretty
that
evening
,
and
presented
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
to
Karenin
.
In
a
moment
he
had
so
kneaded
together
the
*NL*
social
dough
that
the
drawing
room
became
very
lively
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
merry
buzz
of
voices
.
Konstantin
Levin
was
the
only
person
who
had
not
*NL*
arrived
.
But
this
was
so
much
the
better
,
as
going
into
the
dining
room
,
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
found
to
his
horror
that
the
port
and
sherry
had
*NL*
been
procured
from
Depre
,
and
not
from
Levy
,
and
,
directing
that
the
*NL*
coachman
should
be
sent
off
as
speedily
as
possible
to
Levy
's
,
he
was
*NL*
going
back
to
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dining
room
he
was
met
by
Konstantin
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
never
help
being
late
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
taking
his
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
lot
of
people
?
Who
's
here
?
''
asked
Levin
,
unable
to
help
*NL*
blushing
,
as
he
knocked
the
snow
off
his
cap
with
his
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
our
own
set
.
Kitty
's
here
.
Come
along
,
I
'll
introduce
you
to
*NL*
Karenin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
for
all
his
liberal
views
,
was
well
aware
that
to
*NL*
meet
Karenin
was
sure
to
be
felt
a
flattering
distinction
,
and
so
*NL*
treated
his
best
friends
to
this
honor
.
But
at
that
instant
Konstantin
*NL*
Levin
was
not
in
a
condition
to
feel
all
the
gratification
of
making
*NL*
such
an
acquaintance
.
He
had
not
seen
Kitty
since
that
memorable
evening
*NL*
when
he
met
Vronsky
,
not
counting
,
that
is
,
the
moment
when
he
had
had
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
her
on
the
highroad
.
He
had
known
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
*NL*
that
he
would
see
her
here
today
.
But
to
keep
his
thoughts
free
,
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
not
know
it
.
Now
when
he
heard
*NL*
that
she
was
here
,
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
such
delight
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
of
such
dread
,
that
his
breath
failed
him
and
he
could
not
*NL*
utter
what
he
wanted
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
like
,
what
is
she
like
?
Like
what
she
used
to
be
,
or
like
*NL*
what
she
was
in
the
carriage
?
What
if
Darya
Alexandrovna
told
the
truth
?
*NL*
Why
should
n't
it
be
the
truth
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
introduce
me
to
Karenin
,
''
he
brought
out
with
an
effort
,
*NL*
and
with
a
desperately
determined
step
he
walked
into
the
drawing
room
*NL*
and
beheld
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
the
same
as
she
used
to
be
,
nor
was
she
as
she
had
been
in
*NL*
the
carriage
;
she
was
quite
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
scared
,
shy
,
shame-faced
,
and
still
more
charming
from
it
.
She
*NL*
saw
him
the
very
instant
he
walked
into
the
room
.
She
had
been
expecting
*NL*
him
.
She
was
delighted
,
and
so
confused
at
her
own
delight
that
there
*NL*
was
a
moment
,
the
moment
when
he
went
up
to
her
sister
and
glanced
again
*NL*
at
her
,
when
she
,
and
he
,
and
Dolly
,
who
saw
it
all
,
thought
she
would
*NL*
break
down
and
would
begin
to
cry
.
She
crimsoned
,
turned
white
,
*NL*
crimsoned
again
,
and
grew
faint
,
waiting
with
quivering
lips
for
him
to
*NL*
come
to
her
.
He
went
up
to
her
,
bowed
,
and
held
out
his
hand
without
*NL*
speaking
.
Except
for
the
slight
quiver
of
her
lips
and
the
moisture
in
*NL*
her
eyes
that
made
them
brighter
,
her
smile
was
almost
calm
as
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
it
is
since
we
've
seen
each
other
!
''
and
with
desperate
*NL*
determination
she
pressed
his
hand
with
her
cold
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
seen
me
,
but
I
've
seen
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
with
a
radiant
*NL*
smile
of
happiness
.
``
I
saw
you
when
you
were
driving
from
the
railway
*NL*
station
to
Ergushovo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
she
asked
,
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
driving
to
Ergushovo
,
''
said
Levin
,
feeling
as
if
he
would
sob
*NL*
with
the
rapture
that
was
flooding
his
heart
.
``
And
how
dared
I
associate
*NL*
a
thought
of
anything
not
innocent
with
this
touching
creature
?
And
,
*NL*
yes
,
I
do
believe
it
's
true
what
Darya
Alexandrovna
told
me
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
away
to
Karenin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
introduce
you
.
''
He
mentioned
their
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
to
meet
you
again
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
coldly
,
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
acquainted
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
asked
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
spent
three
hours
together
in
the
train
,
''
said
Levin
smiling
,
``
but
*NL*
got
out
,
just
as
in
a
masquerade
,
quite
mystified
--
at
least
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
Come
along
,
please
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
pointing
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
dining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
went
into
the
dining-room
and
went
up
to
a
table
,
laid
with
six
*NL*
sorts
of
spirits
and
as
many
kinds
of
cheese
,
some
with
little
silver
*NL*
spades
and
some
without
,
caviar
,
herrings
,
preserves
of
various
kinds
,
*NL*
and
plates
with
slices
of
French
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
stood
round
the
strong-smelling
spirits
and
salt
delicacies
,
and
*NL*
the
discussion
of
the
Russification
of
Poland
between
Koznishev
,
*NL*
Karenin
,
and
Pestsov
died
down
in
anticipation
of
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
unequaled
in
his
skill
in
winding
up
the
most
*NL*
heated
and
serious
argument
by
some
unexpected
pinch
of
Attic
salt
that
*NL*
changed
the
disposition
of
his
opponent
.
He
did
this
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
been
maintaining
that
the
Russification
of
*NL*
Poland
could
only
be
accomplished
as
a
result
of
larger
measures
which
*NL*
ought
to
be
introduced
by
the
Russian
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pestsov
insisted
that
one
country
can
only
absorb
another
when
it
is
the
*NL*
more
densely
populated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Koznishev
admitted
both
points
,
but
with
limitations
.
As
they
were
going
*NL*
out
of
the
drawing
room
to
conclude
the
argument
,
Koznishev
said
,
*NL*
smiling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
then
,
for
the
Russification
of
our
foreign
populations
there
is
but
*NL*
one
method
--
to
bring
up
as
many
children
as
one
can
.
My
brother
and
I
*NL*
are
terribly
in
fault
,
I
see
.
You
married
men
,
especially
you
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
are
the
real
patriots
:
what
number
have
you
reached
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
smiling
genially
at
their
host
and
holding
out
a
tiny
wine
glass
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
laughed
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
particular
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
that
's
the
best
method
!
''
he
said
,
munching
cheese
and
filling
*NL*
the
wine-glass
with
a
special
sort
of
spirit
.
The
conversation
dropped
*NL*
at
the
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
cheese
is
not
bad
.
Shall
I
give
you
some
?
''
said
the
master
of
the
*NL*
house
.
``
Why
,
have
you
been
going
in
for
gymnastics
again
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
Levin
,
pinching
his
muscle
with
his
left
hand
.
Levin
smiled
,
bent
his
*NL*
arm
,
and
under
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
fingers
the
muscles
swelled
up
like
*NL*
a
sound
cheese
,
hard
as
a
knob
of
iron
,
through
the
fine
cloth
of
the
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
biceps
!
A
perfect
Samson
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
great
strength
is
needed
for
hunting
bears
,
''
observed
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
who
had
the
mistiest
notions
about
the
chase
.
He
cut
off
*NL*
and
spread
with
cheese
a
wafer
of
bread
fine
as
a
spider-web
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
Quite
the
contrary
;
a
child
can
kill
a
bear
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
a
slight
bow
moving
aside
for
the
ladies
,
who
were
approaching
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
killed
a
bear
,
I
've
been
told
!
''
said
Kitty
,
trying
assiduously
*NL*
to
catch
with
her
fork
a
perverse
mushroom
that
would
slip
away
,
and
*NL*
setting
the
lace
quivering
over
her
white
arm
.
``
Are
there
bears
on
your
*NL*
place
?
''
she
added
,
turning
her
charming
little
head
to
him
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
apparently
nothing
extraordinary
in
what
she
said
,
but
what
*NL*
unutterable
meaning
there
was
for
him
in
every
sound
,
in
every
turn
of
*NL*
her
lips
,
her
eyes
,
her
hand
as
she
said
it
!
There
was
entreaty
for
*NL*
forgiveness
,
and
trust
in
him
,
and
tenderness
--
soft
,
timid
*NL*
tenderness
--
and
promise
and
hope
and
love
for
him
,
which
he
could
not
*NL*
but
believe
in
and
which
choked
him
with
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
've
been
hunting
in
the
Tver
province
.
It
was
coming
back
from
*NL*
there
that
I
met
your
_
beaufrere
_
in
the
train
,
or
your
_
beaufrere
's
_
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
''
he
said
with
a
smile
.
``
It
was
an
amusing
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
telling
with
droll
good-humor
how
,
after
not
sleeping
all
*NL*
night
,
he
had
,
wearing
an
old
fur-lined
,
full-skirted
coat
,
got
into
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
compartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
conductor
,
forgetting
the
proverb
,
would
have
chucked
me
out
on
*NL*
account
of
my
attire
;
but
thereupon
I
began
expressing
my
feelings
in
*NL*
elevated
language
,
and
...
you
,
too
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Karenin
and
*NL*
forgetting
his
name
,
``
at
first
would
have
ejected
me
on
the
ground
of
*NL*
the
old
coat
,
but
afterwards
you
took
my
part
,
for
which
I
am
extremely
*NL*
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rights
of
passengers
generally
to
choose
their
seats
are
too
*NL*
ill-defined
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
rubbing
the
tips
of
his
*NL*
fingers
on
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
were
in
uncertainty
about
me
,
''
said
Levin
,
smiling
*NL*
good-naturedly
,
``
but
I
made
haste
to
plunge
into
intellectual
*NL*
conversation
to
smooth
over
the
defects
of
my
attire
.
''
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
while
he
kept
up
a
conversation
with
their
hostess
,
had
one
*NL*
ear
for
his
brother
,
and
he
glanced
askance
at
him
.
``
What
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
him
today
?
Why
such
a
conquering
hero
?
''
he
thought
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
that
Levin
was
feeling
as
though
he
had
grown
wings
.
Levin
knew
she
was
*NL*
listening
to
his
words
and
that
she
was
glad
to
listen
to
him
.
And
this
*NL*
was
the
only
thing
that
interested
him
.
Not
in
that
room
only
,
but
in
*NL*
the
whole
world
,
there
existed
for
him
only
himself
,
with
enormously
*NL*
increased
importance
and
dignity
in
his
own
eyes
,
and
she
.
He
felt
*NL*
himself
on
a
pinnacle
that
made
him
giddy
,
and
far
away
down
below
were
*NL*
all
those
nice
excellent
Karenins
,
Oblonskys
,
and
all
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
without
attracting
notice
,
without
glancing
at
them
,
as
though
*NL*
there
were
no
other
places
left
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
put
Levin
and
Kitty
*NL*
side
by
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
may
as
well
sit
there
,
''
he
said
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
as
choice
as
the
china
,
in
which
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
*NL*
a
connoisseur
.
The
_
soupe
Marie-Louise
_
was
a
splendid
success
;
the
tiny
*NL*
pies
eaten
with
it
melted
in
the
mouth
and
were
irreproachable
.
The
two
*NL*
footmen
and
Matvey
,
in
white
cravats
,
did
their
duty
with
the
dishes
and
*NL*
wines
unobtrusively
,
quietly
,
and
swiftly
.
On
the
material
side
the
*NL*
dinner
was
a
success
;
it
was
no
less
so
on
the
immaterial
.
The
*NL*
conversation
,
at
times
general
and
at
times
between
individuals
,
never
*NL*
paused
,
and
towards
the
end
the
company
was
so
lively
that
the
men
rose
*NL*
from
the
table
,
without
stopping
speaking
,
and
even
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
thawed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Pestsov
liked
thrashing
an
argument
out
to
the
end
,
and
was
not
*NL*
satisfied
with
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
words
,
especially
as
he
felt
the
*NL*
injustice
of
his
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
mean
,
''
he
said
over
the
soup
,
addressing
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
``
mere
density
of
population
alone
,
but
in
conjunction
*NL*
with
fundamental
ideas
,
and
not
by
means
of
principles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
languidly
,
and
with
no
*NL*
haste
,
``
that
that
's
the
same
thing
.
In
my
opinion
,
influence
over

another
people

only
possible

the
people
which
has
the
higher
*NL*
development

which

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
just
the
question

''
Pestsov
broke
in
in
his
bass
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
always
in
a
hurry
to
speak
,
and
seemed
always
to
put
his
whole
*NL*
soul
into
what
he
was
saying
.
``
In
what
are
we
to
make
higher
development
*NL*
consist
?
The
English
,
the
French
,
the
Germans
,
which
is
at
the
highest
*NL*
stage
of
development
?
Which
of
them
will
nationalize
the
other
?
We
see
*NL*
the
Rhine
provinces
have
been
turned
French
,
but
the
Germans
are
not
at
*NL*
a
lower
stage
!
''
he
shouted
.
``
There
is
another
law
at
work
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
that
the
greater
influence
is
always
on
the
side
of
true
*NL*
civilization

''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
slightly
lifting
his
*NL*
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
we
to
lay
down
as
the
outward
signs
of
true
civilization

*NL*
said
Pestsov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
such
signs
are
generally
very
well
known

said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
are
they
fully
known
?
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
put
in
with
a
subtle
*NL*
smile
.
``
It
is
the
accepted
view
now
that
real
culture
must
be
purely
*NL*
classical
;
but
we
see
most
intense
disputes
on
each
side
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
there
is
no
denying
that
the
opposite
camp
has
strong

points
in
its
favor

``

``

Sergey

Ivanovitch
said
,
holding
out
his
glass
with
a
smile
of
condescension
,
as
*NL*
to
a
child
.
``
I
only
say
that
both
sides
have
strong
arguments

support

them

he
went
on
,
addressing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
My
sympathies
are
*NL*
classical
from
education

but
in
this
discussion
I
am
personally
unable

to
arrive
at
a
conclusion

I
see
no
distinct
grounds

given

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
natural

great
an

in

Pestsov

general
principles

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
quite
agree
with
that

responded
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
``
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
one
must
admit

the
very
process

forms

has
a
peculiarly
favorable
influence

it
can
not

influence

is
in

highest
degree
moral

while
,
unfortunately

*NL*
with

*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
would
have
said
something
,

Pestsov
interrupted
him
*NL*
in
his
rich
bass
.
He
began
warmly
contesting
the
justice
of
this
view

*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
waited
serenely
to
speak

obviously
with
a
convincing

ready

*NL*
``

``
One

now
we
know
that
these
little
pills
of
classical
*NL*
learning
possess
the
medicinal
property
of
anti-nihilism
,
and
we
boldly
*NL*
prescribe
them
to
our
patients
...
But
what
if
they
had
no
such
*NL*
medicinal
property
?
''
he
wound
up
humorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
little
pills
,
everyone
laughed
;
Turovtsin
in
*NL*
especial
roared
loudly
and
jovially
,
glad
at
last
to
have
found
*NL*
something
to
laugh
at
,
all
he
ever
looked
for
in
listening
to
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
not
made
a
mistake
in
inviting
Pestsov
.
With
*NL*
Pestsov
intellectual
conversation
never
flagged
for
an
instant
.
Directly
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
concluded
the
conversation
with
his
jest
,
Pestsov
*NL*
promptly
started
a
new
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
agree
even
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
the
government
had
that
aim
.
The
*NL*
government
obviously
is
guided
by
abstract
considerations
,
and
remains
*NL*
indifferent
to
the
influence
its
measures
may
exercise
.
The
education
of
*NL*
women
,
for
instance
,
would
naturally
be
regarded
as
likely
to
be
*NL*
harmful
,
but
the
government
opens
schools
and
universities
for
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
conversation
at
once
passed
to
the
new
subject
of
the
education
*NL*
of
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
expressed
the
idea
that
the
education
of
women
is
*NL*
apt
to
be
confounded
with
the
emancipation
of
women
,
and
that
it
is
only
*NL*
so
that
it
can
be
considered
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
the
two
questions
are
inseparably
*NL*
connected
together
,
''
said
Pestsov
;
``
it
is
a
vicious
circle
.
Woman
is
*NL*
deprived
of
rights
from
lack
of
education
,
and
the
lack
of
education
*NL*
results
from
the
absence
of
rights
.
We
must
not
forget
that
the
*NL*
subjection
of
women
is
so
complete
,
and
dates
from
such
ages
back
that
*NL*
we
are
often
unwilling
to
recognize
the
gulf
that
separates
them
from
*NL*
us
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
rights
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
waiting
till
Pestsov
had
*NL*
finished
,
``
meaning
the
right
of
sitting
on
juries
,
of
voting
,
of
*NL*
presiding
at
official
meetings
,
the
right
of
entering
the
civil
service
,
*NL*
of
sitting
in
parliament
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
women
,
as
a
rare
exception
,
can
occupy
such
positions
,
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
you
are
wrong
in
using
the
expression
`
rights
.
'
It
would
be
more
*NL*
correct
to
say
duties
.
Every
man
will
agree
that
in
doing
the
duty
of
a
*NL*
juryman
,
a
witness
,
a
telegraph
clerk
,
we
feel
we
are
performing
duties
.
*NL*
And
therefore
it
would
be
correct
to
say
that
women
are
seeking
duties
,
*NL*
and
quite
legitimately
.
And
one
can
but
sympathize
with
this
desire
to
*NL*
assist
in
the
general
labor
of
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
so
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
assented
.
``
The
question
,
I
imagine
,
is
*NL*
simply
whether
they
are
fitted
for
such
duties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
most
likely
be
perfectly
fitted
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
``
when
education
has
become
general
among
them
.
We
see
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
the
proverb
?
''
said
the
prince
,
who
had
a
long
while
been
*NL*
intent
on
the
conversation
,
his
little
comical
eyes
twinkling
.
``
I
can
*NL*
say
it
before
my
daughter
:
her
hair
is
long
,
because
her
wit
is
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
they
thought
of
the
negroes
before
their
emancipation
!
''
said
*NL*
Pestsov
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
seems
strange
to
me
is
that
women
should
seek
fresh
duties
,
''
said
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
``
while
we
see
,
unhappily
,
that
men
usually
try
to
*NL*
avoid
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duties
are
bound
up
with
rights
--
power
,
money
,
honor
;
those
are
what
*NL*
women
are
seeking
,
''
said
Pestsov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
though
I
should
seek
the
right
to
be
a
wet-nurse
and
feel
*NL*
injured
because
women
are
paid
for
the
work
,
while
no
one
will
take
me
,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turovtsin
exploded
in
a
loud
roar
of
laughter
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
regretted
that
he
had
not
made
this
comparison
.
Even
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
a
man
ca
n't
nurse
a
baby

''
said
Pestsov
,
``
while
a
woman
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
there
was
an
Englishman
who
did
suckle
his
baby
on
board

,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
prince
,
feeling
this
freedom
in
conversation
permissible
*NL*
before
his
own
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
as
many
such
Englishmen

there

''
*NL*
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
what
is
a

to
do
who
has
no

''
put
in
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
thinking
of
Masha
Tchibisova
,
whom
he
had
had
in
his
mind
*NL*
all
along
,
in
sympathizing
with
Pestsov
and
supporting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
story
of
such

were
thoroughly
sifted
,
you
would
find
she
*NL*
had
abandoned
a

her
own
or
a
sister
's
,
where
she
might
have
*NL*
found
a
woman
's
duties
,
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
broke
in
unexpectedly
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
exasperation
,
probably
suspecting
what
sort
of
girl
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
thinking
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
take
our
stand
on
principle
as
the
ideal
,
''
replied
Pestsov
in
*NL*
his
mellow
bass
.
``
Woman
desires
to
have
rights

She

oppressed

humiliated

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
oppressed

humiliated

they

the
old
prince
said
again
,
to
the
huge
delight
of
Turovtsin
,
*NL*
who
in
his
mirth
dropped
his
asparagus
with
the
thick

in

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
took
part
in
the
conversation
except
Kitty
and
Levin
.
At
first
,
*NL*
when
they
were
talking
of
the
influence
that
one
people
has
on
another
,
*NL*
there
rose
to
Levin
's
mind
what
he
had
to
say
on
the
subject
.
But
these
*NL*
ideas
,
once
of
such
importance
in
his
eyes
,
seemed
to
come
into
his
*NL*
brain
as
in
a
dream
,
and
had
now
not
the
slightest
interest
for
him
.
It
*NL*
even
struck
him
as
strange
that
they
should
be
so
eager
to
talk
of
what
*NL*
was
of
no
use
to
anyone
.
Kitty
,
too
,
should
,
one
would
have
supposed
,
*NL*
have
been
interested
in
what
they
were
saying
of
the
rights
and
*NL*
education
of
women
.
How
often
she
had
mused
on
the
subject
,
thinking
of
*NL*
her
friend
abroad
,
Varenka
,
of
her
painful
state
of
dependence
,
how
*NL*
often
she
had
wondered
about
herself
what
would
become
of
her
if
she
did
*NL*
not
marry
,
and
how
often
she
had
argued
with
her
sister
about
it
!
But
it
*NL*
did
not
interest
her
at
all
.
She
and
Levin
had
a
conversation
of
their
*NL*
own
,
yet
not
a
conversation
,
but
some
sort
of
mysterious
communication
,
*NL*
which
brought
them
every
moment
nearer
,
and
stirred
in
both
a
sense
of
*NL*
glad
terror
before
the
unknown
into
which
they
were
entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Levin
,
in
answer
to
Kitty
's
question
how
he
could
have
seen
her
*NL*
last
year
in
the
carriage
,
told
her
how
he
had
been
coming
home
from
the
*NL*
mowing
along
the
highroad
and
had
met
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
very
,
very
early
in
the
morning
.
You
were
probably
only
just
*NL*
awake
.
Your
mother
was
asleep
in
the
corner
.
It
was
an
exquisite
*NL*
morning
.
I
was
walking
along
wondering
who
it
could
be
in
a
*NL*
four-in-hand
?
It
was
a
splendid
set
of
four
horses
with
bells
,
and
in
a
*NL*
second
you
flashed
by
,
and
I
saw
you
at
the
window
--
you
were
sitting
*NL*
like
this
,
holding
the
strings
of
your
cap
in
both
hands
,
and
thinking
*NL*
awfully
deeply
about
something
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
.
``
How
I
should
like
to
*NL*
know
what
you
were
thinking
about
then
!
Something
important
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
I
dreadfully
untidy
?
''
she
wondered
,
but
seeing
the
smile
of
*NL*
ecstasy
these
reminiscences
called
up
,
she
felt
that
the
impression
she
*NL*
had
made
had
been
very
good
.
She
blushed
and
laughed
with
delight
;
*NL*
``
Really
I
do
n't
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nicely
Turovtsin
laughs
!
''
said
Levin
,
admiring
his
moist
eyes
and
*NL*
shaking
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
known
him
long
?
''
asked
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
everyone
knows
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
see
you
think
he
's
a
horrid
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
horrid
,
but
nothing
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
wrong
!
And
you
must
give
up
thinking
so
directly
!
''
said
*NL*
Kitty
.
``
I
used
to
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
him
too
,
but
he
,
he
's
an
*NL*
awfully
nice
and
wonderfully
good-hearted
man
.
He
has
a
heart
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
find
out
what
sort
of
heart
he
has
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
great
friends

I
know
him
very
well

Last
winter
,
soon
after
...
*NL*
you
came
to
see
us
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
guilty
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
confiding
smile
,
``
all
Dolly
's
children
had
scarlet
fever
,
and
he
*NL*
happened
to
come
and
see
her
.
And
only
fancy
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
``
he
felt
so
sorry
for
her
that
he
stayed
and
began
to
help
her
look
*NL*
after
the
children
.
Yes
,
and
for
three
weeks
he
stopped
with
them
,
and
*NL*
looked
after
the
children
like
a
nurse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
telling
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
about
Turovtsin
in
the
scarlet
*NL*
fever
,
''
she
said
,
bending
over
to
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
wonderful
,
noble
!
''
said
Dolly
,
glancing
towards
Turovtsin
,
*NL*
who
had
become
aware
they
were
talking
of
him
,
and
smiling
gently
to
*NL*
him
.
Levin
glanced
once
more
at
Turovtsin
,
and
wondered
how
it
was
he
*NL*
had
not
realized
all
this
man
's
goodness
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
I
'm
sorry
,
and
I
'll
never
think
ill
of
people
again

he
*NL*
said
gaily

genuinely
expressing
what
he
felt
at
the
moment

*NL*
*NL*
Connected
with
the
conversation
that
had
sprung
up
on
the
rights
of
*NL*
women
there
were
certain
questions
as
to
the
inequality
of
rights
in
*NL*
marriage
improper
to
discuss
before
the
ladies
.
Pestsov
had
several
*NL*
times
during
dinner
touched
upon
these
questions
,
but
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
carefully
drew
him
off
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
rose
from
the
table
and
the
ladies
had
gone
out
,
Pestsov
did
*NL*
not
follow
them
,
but
addressing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
began
to
expound
*NL*
the
chief
ground
of
inequality
.
The
inequality
in
marriage
,
in
his
*NL*
opinion
,
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
infidelity
of
the
wife
and
the
*NL*
infidelity
of
the
husband
are
punished
unequally
,
both
by
the
law
and
by
*NL*
public
opinion
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
hurriedly
up
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
and
offered
him
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
smoke
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
answered
calmly
,
and
as
*NL*
though
purposely
wishing
to
show
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
subject
,
*NL*
he
turned
to
Pestsov
with
a
chilly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
such
a
view
has
a
foundation
in
the
very
nature
of
*NL*
things
,
''
he
said
,
and
would
have
gone
on
to
the
drawing
room
.
But
at
*NL*
this
point
Turovtsin
broke
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
into
the
*NL*
conversation
,
addressing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
heard
,
perhaps
,
about
Pryatchnikov
?
''
said
Turovtsin
,
warmed
up
by
*NL*
the
champagne
he
had
drunk
,
and
long
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
break
*NL*
the
silence
that
had
weighed
on
him
.
``
Vasya
Pryatchnikov
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
a
good-natured
smile
on
his
damp
,
red
lips
,
addressing
himself
*NL*
principally
to
the
most
important
guest
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
``
they
*NL*
told
me
today
he
fought
a
duel
with
Kvitsky
at
Tver
,
and
has
killed
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
it
always
seems
that
one
bruises
oneself
on
a
sore
place
,
so
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
felt
now
that
the
conversation
would
by
ill
luck
*NL*
fall
every
moment
on
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
sore
spot
.
He
would
again
*NL*
have
got
his
brother-in-law
away
,
but
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
himself
*NL*
inquired
,
with
curiosity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
Pryatchnikov
fight
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
wife
.
Acted
like
a
man
,
he
did
!
Called
him
out
and
shot
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
indifferently
,
and
lifting
his
*NL*
eyebrows
,
he
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
you
have
come
,
''
Dolly
said
with
a
frightened
smile
,
*NL*
meeting
him
in
the
outer
drawing
room
.
``
I
must
talk
to
you
.
Let
's
sit
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
with
the
same
expression
of
indifference
,
given
*NL*
him
by
his
lifted
eyebrows
,
sat
down
beside
Darya
Alexandrovna

and
*NL*
smiled
affectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
fortunate

''
said
he
,
``
especially
as
I
was
meaning
to
ask
you
to
*NL*
excuse
me

and
to
be
taking
leave

I
have
to
start
tomorrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
firmly
convinced
of
Anna
's
innocence
,
and
she
*NL*
felt
herself
growing
pale
and
her
lips
quivering
with
anger
at
this
*NL*
frigid
,
unfeeling
man
,
who
was
so
calmly
intending
to
ruin
her
innocent
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
''
she
said
,
with
desperate
resolution
looking
him
*NL*
in
the
face
,
``
I
asked
you
about
Anna
,
you
made
me
no
answer

How
is
*NL*
she
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is

I
believe

quite
well

Darya

replied
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
not
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
forgive
me
,
I
have
no
right

but
I
love
Anna

as

esteem
her

I
beg

I
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
is

wrong
between

what
fault
do
you
find
with

*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
frowned
,
and
almost
closing
his
eyes
,
dropped
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presume
that
your
husband
has
told
you
the
grounds
on
which
I
*NL*
consider
it
necessary
to
change
my
attitude
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
not
looking
her
in
the
face
,
but
eyeing
with
displeasure
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
,
who
was
walking
across
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

I
do

I
ca

Dolly
*NL*
said
,
clasping
her
bony
hands
before
her
with
a
vigorous
gesture
.
She
*NL*
rose
quickly
,
and
laid
her
hand
on
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
sleeve
.
``
We
*NL*
shall
be
disturbed
here
.
Come
this
way
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
's
agitation
had
an
effect
on
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
He
got
up
and
*NL*
submissively
followed
her
to
the
schoolroom
.
They
sat
down
to
a
table
*NL*
covered
with
an
oilcloth
cut
in
slits
by
penknives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
,
I
do
n't

Dolly
said
,
trying
to
catch
his
glance
*NL*
that
avoided
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
not
disbelieve
facts

Darya
Alexandrovna

said
he
,
with
an
*NL*
emphasis
on
the
word
``
facts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
she
done

said
Darya
Alexandrovna

``
What

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

No

for
God

you
are
mistaken

said
Dolly
,
*NL*
putting
her
hands
to
her
temples
and
closing
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
smiled
coldly
,
with
his
lips
alone
,
meaning
to
*NL*
signify
to
her
and
to
himself
the
firmness
of
his
conviction
;
but
this
*NL*
warm
defense
,
though
it
could
not
shake
him
,
reopened
his
wound
.
He
*NL*
began
to
speak
with
greater
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
extremely
difficult
to
be
mistaken
when
a
wife
herself
informs
*NL*
her
husband
of
the
fact

informs
him
that
eight
years
of
her
life
,
and
a
*NL*
son
,
all
that
's
a
mistake
,
and
that
she
wants
to
begin
life
again

he
*NL*
said
angrily
,
with
a
snort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
and
sin

I
can
not
connect
them

I
can
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Darya
Alexandrovna

''
he
said
,
now
looking
straight
into
Dolly
's
kindly
,
*NL*
troubled
face
,
and
feeling
that
his
tongue
was
being
loosened
in
spite
*NL*
of
himself
,
``
I
would
give
a
great
deal
for
doubt
to
be
still
possible

*NL*
When
I
doubted
,
I
was
miserable
,
but
it
was
better
than
now

When
I
*NL*
doubted
,
I
had
hope
;
but
now
there
is
no
hope
,
and
still
I
doubt
of
*NL*
everything

I
am
in
such
doubt
of
everything
that
I
even
hate
my
son

*NL*
and
sometimes
do
not
believe
he
is
my
son
.
I
am
very
unhappy

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
need
to
say
that
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
seen
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
glanced
into
her
face
;
and
she
felt
sorry
for
him
,
and
her
faith
in
*NL*
the
innocence
of
her
friend
began
to
totter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
awful

awful

But
can
it

true

with
tears
in

her
eyes

``
Oh
no

she
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
horrible

in

in

bear
one

said
he
,
as
though
guessing
her
thought

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand

I
quite
understand
that
,
''
said
Dolly
,
and
her
head
sank
.
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
a
little
,
thinking
of
herself
,
of
her
own
grief
in
*NL*
her
family
,
and
all
at
once
,
with
an
impulsive
movement
,
she
raised
her
*NL*
head
and
clasped
her
hands
with
an
imploring
gesture
.
``
But
wait
a
*NL*
little
!
You
are
a
Christian

Think
of
her
!
What
will
become
of

if
*NL*
you
cast
her
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
I
have
thought
a
great

said
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
His
face
turned
red
in
patches
,
and
his
dim
eyes
*NL*
looked
straight
before
him
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
at
that
moment
pitied
him
*NL*
with
all
her
heart
.
``
That
was
what
I
did
indeed
when
she
herself
made
*NL*
known
to
me
my
humiliation
;
I
left
everything
as
of
old
.
I
gave
her
a
*NL*
chance
to
reform
,
I
tried
to
save
her
.
And
with
what
result
?
She
would
*NL*
not
regard
the
slightest
request
--
that
she
should
observe
decorum
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
getting
heated
.
``
One
may
save
anyone
who
does
not
want
to
be
*NL*
ruined
;
but
if
the
whole
nature
is
so
corrupt
,
so
depraved
,
that
ruin
*NL*
itself
seems
to
be
her
salvation
,
what
's
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
,
only
not
divorce

answered
Darya
Alexandrovna
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

it

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
raising
his
shoulders
and
*NL*
his
eyebrows
.
The
recollection
of
his
wife
's
last
act
had
so
incensed
*NL*
him
that
he
had
become
frigid
,
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
.
*NL*
``
I
am
very
grateful
for
your
sympathy
,
but
I
must
be
going
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
a
minute
.
You
must
not
ruin
her
.
Wait
a
little
;
I
will
tell
*NL*
you
about
myself
.
I
was
married
,
and
my
husband
deceived
me
;
in
anger
*NL*
and
jealousy
,
I
would
have
thrown
up
everything
,
I
would
myself
...
But
*NL*
I
came
to
myself
again
;
and
who
did
it
?
Anna
saved
me
.
And
here
I
am
*NL*
living
on
.
The
children
are
growing
up
,
my
husband
has
come
back
to
his
*NL*
family
,
and
feels
his
fault
,
is
growing
purer
,
better
,
and
I
live
on
...
*NL*
I
have
forgiven
it
,
and
you
ought
to
forgive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
heard
her
,
but
her
words
had
no
effect
on
him
now
.
*NL*
All
the
hatred
of
that
day
when
he
had
resolved
on
a
divorce
had
sprung
*NL*
up
again
in
his
soul
.
He
shook
himself
,
and
said
in
a
shrill
,
loud
*NL*
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
I
can
not
,
and
do
not
wish
to
,
and
I
regard
it
as
wrong
.
I
have
*NL*
done
everything
for
this
woman
,
and
she
has
trodden
it
all
in
the
mud
to
*NL*
which
she
is
akin
.
I
am
not
a
spiteful
man
,
I
have
never
hated
anyone
,
*NL*
but
I
hate
her
with
my
whole
soul
,
and
I
can
not
even
forgive
her
,
*NL*
because
I
hate
her
too
much
for
all
the
wrong
she
has
done
me
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
tones
of
hatred
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
those
that
hate
you
...
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
whispered
timorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
smiled
contemptuously
.
That
he
knew
long
ago
,
but
*NL*
it
could
not
be
applied
to
his
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
those
that
hate
you
,
but
to
love
those
one
hates
is
impossible

*NL*
Forgive
me
for
having
troubled
you
.
Everyone
has
enough
to
bear
in
his
*NL*
own
grief
!
''
And
regaining
his
self-possession
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
quietly
took
leave
and
went
away
.

*NL*
When
they
rose
from
table
,
Levin
would
have
liked
to
follow
Kitty
into
*NL*
the
drawing
room
;
but
he
was
afraid
she
might
dislike
this
,
as
too
*NL*
obviously
paying
her
attention
.
He
remained
in
the
little
ring
of
men
,
*NL*
taking
part
in
the
general
conversation
,
and
without
looking
at
Kitty
,
*NL*
he
was
aware
of
her
movements
,
her
looks
,
and
the
place
where
she
was
in
*NL*
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
at
once
,
and
without
the
smallest
effort
,
keep
the
promise
he
had
*NL*
made
her
--
always
to
think
well
of
all
men
,
and
to
like
everyone
always
.
*NL*
The
conversation
fell
on
the
village
commune
,
in
which
Pestsov
saw
a
*NL*
sort
of
special
principle
,
called
by
him
the
choral
principle
.
Levin
did
*NL*
not
agree
with
Pestsov
,
nor
with
his
brother
,
who
had
a
special
attitude
*NL*
of
his
own
,
both
admitting
and
not
admitting
the
significance
of
the
*NL*
Russian
commune
.
But
he
talked
to
them
,
simply
trying
to
reconcile
and
*NL*
soften
their
differences
.
He
was
not
in
the
least
interested
in
what
he
*NL*
said
himself
,
and
even
less
so
in
what
they
said
;
all
he
wanted
was
that
*NL*
they
and
everyone
should
be
happy
and
contented
.
He
knew
now
the
one
*NL*
thing
of
importance
;
and
that
one
thing
was
at
first
there
,
in
the
*NL*
drawing
room
,
and
then
began
moving
across
and
came
to
a
standstill
at
*NL*
the
door
.
Without
turning
round
he
felt
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
and
the
*NL*
smile
,
and
he
could
not
help
turning
round
.
She
was
standing
in
the
*NL*
doorway
with
Shtcherbatsky
,
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
towards
the
piano
,
''
said
he
,
going
up
to
her
.
*NL*
``
That
's
something
I
miss
in
the
country
--
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
we
only
came
to
fetch
you
and
thank
you
,
''
she
said
,
rewarding
him
*NL*
with
a
smile
that
was
like
a
gift
,
``
for
coming
.
What
do
they
want
to
*NL*
argue
for
?
No
one
ever
convinces
anyone
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
true
,
''
said
Levin
;
``
it
generally
happens
that
one
argues
*NL*
warmly
simply
because
one
ca
n't
make
out
what
one
's
opponent
wants
to
*NL*
prove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
often
noticed
in
discussions
between
the
most
intelligent
*NL*
people
that
after
enormous
efforts
,
and
an
enormous
expenditure
of
*NL*
logical
subtleties
and
words
,
the
disputants
finally
arrived
at
being
*NL*
aware
that
what
they
had
so
long
been
struggling
to
prove
to
one
another
*NL*
had
long
ago
,
from
the
beginning
of
the
argument
,
been
known
to
both
,
*NL*
but
that
they
liked
different
things
,
and
would
not
define
what
they
*NL*
liked
for
fear
of
its
being
attacked
.
He
had
often
had
the
experience
of
*NL*
suddenly
in
a
discussion
grasping
what
it
was
his
opponent
liked
and
at
*NL*
once
liking
it
too
,
and
immediately
he
found
himself
agreeing
,
and
then
*NL*
all
arguments
fell
away
as
useless
.
Sometimes
,
too
,
he
had
experienced
*NL*
the
opposite
,
expressing
at
last
what
he
liked
himself
,
which
he
was
*NL*
devising
arguments
to
defend
,
and
,
chancing
to
express
it
well
and
*NL*
genuinely
,
he
had
found
his
opponent
at
once
agreeing
and
ceasing
to
*NL*
dispute
his
position
.
He
tried
to
say
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knitted
her
brow
,
trying
to
understand
.
But
directly
he
began
to
*NL*
illustrate
his
meaning
,
she
understood
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
:
one
must
find
out
what
he
is
arguing
for
,
what
is
precious
to
*NL*
him
,
then
one
can
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
completely
guessed
and
expressed
his
badly
expressed
idea
.
Levin
*NL*
smiled
joyfully
;
he
was
struck
by
this
transition
from
the
confused
,
*NL*
verbose
discussion
with
Pestsov
and
his
brother
to
this
laconic
,
clear
,
*NL*
almost
wordless
communication
of
the
most
complex
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
moved
away
from
them
,
and
Kitty
,
going
up
to
a
card
table
,
*NL*
sat
down
,
and
,
taking
up
the
chalk
,
began
drawing
diverging
circles
over
*NL*
the
new
green
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
again
on
the
subject
that
had
been
started
at
dinner
--
the
*NL*
liberty
and
occupations
of
women
.
Levin
was
of
the
opinion
of
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
that
a
girl
who
did
not
marry
should
find
a
woman
's
duties
*NL*
in
a
family
.
He
supported
this
view
by
the
fact
that
no
family
can
get
*NL*
on
without
women
to
help
;
that
in
every
family
,
poor
or
rich
,
there
are
*NL*
and
must
be
nurses
,
either
relations
or
hired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Kitty
,
blushing
,
but
looking
at
him
all
the
more
boldly
with
*NL*
her
truthful
eyes
;
``
a
girl
may
be
so
circumstanced
that
she
can
not
live
*NL*
in
the
family
without
humiliation
,
while
she
herself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hint
he
understood
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
--
you
're
right
;
you
're
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
saw
all
that
Pestsov
had
been
maintaining
at
dinner
of
the
*NL*
liberty
of
woman
,
simply
from
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
terror
of
an
old
*NL*
maid
's
existence
and
its
humiliation
in
Kitty
's
heart
;
and
loving
her
,
*NL*
he
felt
that
terror
and
humiliation
,
and
at
once
gave
up
his
arguments
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
followed
.
She
was
still
drawing
with
the
chalk
on
the
table
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
shining
with
a
soft
light
.
Under
the
influence
of
her
mood
*NL*
he
felt
in
all
his
being
a
continually
growing
tension
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
've
scribbled
all
over
the
table
!
''
she
said
,
and
,
laying
down
the
*NL*
chalk
,
she
made
a
movement
as
though
to
get
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
shall
I
be
left
alone
--
without
her
?
''
he
thought
with
horror
,
and
*NL*
he
took
the
chalk
.
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
to
the
table
.
*NL*
``
I
've
long
wanted
to
ask
you
one
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
straight
into
her
caressing
,
though
frightened
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
ask
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
;
and
he
wrote
the
initial
letters
,
_
w
,
y
,
t
,
m
,
i
,
c
,
n
,
*NL*
b
,
d
,
t
,
m
,
n
,
o
,
t
_
.
These
letters
meant
,
``
When
you
told
me
it
could
*NL*
never
be
,
did
that
mean
never
,
or
then
?
''
There
seemed
no
likelihood
that
*NL*
she
could
make
out
this
complicated
sentence
;
but
he
looked
at
her
as
*NL*
though
his
life
depended
on
her
understanding
the
words
.
She
glanced
at
*NL*
him
seriously
,
then
leaned
her
puckered
brow
on
her
hands
and
began
to
*NL*
read
.
Once
or
twice
she
stole
a
look
at
him
,
as
though
asking
him
,
``
Is
*NL*
it
what
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
she
said
,
flushing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
word
?
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
n
that
stood
for
_
never
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
_
never
_
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
that
's
not
true
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
quickly
rubbed
out
what
he
had
written
,
gave
her
the
chalk
,
and
stood
*NL*
up
.
She
wrote
,
_
t
,
i
,
c
,
n
,
a
,
d
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
completely
comforted
in
the
depression
caused
by
her
*NL*
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
*NL*
figures
:
Kitty
with
the
chalk
in
her
hand
,
with
a
shy
and
happy
smile
*NL*
looking
upwards
at
Levin
,
and
his
handsome
figure
bending
over
the
table
*NL*
with
glowing
eyes
fastened
one
minute
on
the
table
and
the
next
on
her
.
*NL*
He
was
suddenly
radiant
:
he
had
understood
.
It
meant
,
``
Then
I
could
not
*NL*
answer
differently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
questioningly
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
her
smile
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
n.
.
.
and
now
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
read
this
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
should
like
--
should
like
so
*NL*
much
!
''
she
wrote
the
initial
letters
,
i
,
y
,
c
,
f
,
a
,
f
,
w
,
h
.
This
*NL*
meant
,
``
If
you
could
forget
and
forgive
what
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
snatched
the
chalk
with
nervous
,
trembling
fingers
,
and
breaking
it
,
*NL*
wrote
the
initial
letters
of
the
following
phrase
,
``
I
have
nothing
to
*NL*
forget
and
to
forgive
;
I
have
never
ceased
to
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
that
did
not
waver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
she
said
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
phrase
.
She
understood
it
all
,
and
without
*NL*
asking
him
,
``
Is
it
this
?
''
took
the
chalk
and
at
once
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
he
could
not
understand
what
she
had
written
,
and
often
*NL*
looked
into
her
eyes
.
He
was
stupefied
with
happiness
.
He
could
not
*NL*
supply
the
word
she
had
meant
;
but
in
her
charming
eyes
,
beaming
with
*NL*
happiness
,
he
saw
all
he
needed
to
know
.
And
he
wrote
three
letters
.
But
*NL*
he
had
hardly
finished
writing
when
she
read
them
over
her
arm
,
and
*NL*
herself
finished
and
wrote
the
answer
,
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
playing
_
secretaire
_
?
''
said
the
old
prince
.
``
But
we
must
really
*NL*
be
getting
along
if
you
want
to
be
in
time
at
the
theater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
got
up
and
escorted
Kitty
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
conversation
everything
had
been
said
;
it
had
been
said
that
*NL*
she
loved
him
,
and
that
she
would
tell
her
father
and
mother
that
he
*NL*
would
come
tomorrow
morning
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Kitty
had
gone
and
Levin
was
left
alone
,
he
felt
such
uneasiness
*NL*
without
her
,
and
such
an
impatient
longing
to
get
as
quickly
,
as
quickly
*NL*
as
possible
,
to
tomorrow
morning
,
when
he
would
see
her
again
and
be
*NL*
plighted
to
her
forever
,
that
he
felt
afraid
,
as
though
of
death
,
of
*NL*
those
fourteen
hours
that
he
had
to
get
through
without
her
.
It
was
*NL*
essential
for
him
to
be
with
someone
to
talk
to
,
so
as
not
to
be
left
*NL*
alone
,
to
kill
time
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
would
have
been
the
companion
*NL*
most
congenial
to
him
,
but
he
was
going
out
,
he
said
,
to
a
_
soiree
_
,
in
*NL*
reality
to
the
ballet
.
Levin
only
had
time
to
tell
him
he
was
happy
,
and
*NL*
that
he
loved
him
,
and
would
never
,
never
forget
what
he
had
done
for
*NL*
him
.
The
eyes
and
the
smile
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
showed
Levin
that
he
*NL*
comprehended
that
feeling
fittingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
it
's
not
time
to
die
yet
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
pressing
*NL*
Levin
's
hand
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
N-n-no
!
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
too
,
as
she
said
good-bye
to
him
,
gave
him
a
sort
of
*NL*
congratulation
,
saying
,
``
How
glad
I
am
you
have
met
Kitty
again
!
One
*NL*
must
value
old
friends
.
''
Levin
did
not
like
these
words
of
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
's
.
She
could
not
understand
how
lofty
and
beyond
her
it
all
*NL*
was
,
and
she
ought
not
to
have
dared
to
allude
to
it
.
Levin
said
*NL*
good-bye
to
them
,
but
,
not
to
be
left
alone
,
he
attached
himself
to
his
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
a
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
come
with
you
.
May
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
Yes
,
come
along
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
smiling
.
``
What
is
*NL*
the
matter
with
you
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
Happiness
is
the
matter
with
me
!
''
said
Levin
,
letting
down
the
*NL*
window
of
the
carriage
they
were
driving
in
.
``
You
do
n't
mind
?
--
it
's
so
*NL*
stifling
.
It
's
happiness
is
the
matter
with
me
!
Why
is
it
you
have
never
*NL*
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
,
she
seems
a
nice
gi
...
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
it
!
do
n't
say
it
!
''
shouted
Levin
,
clutching
at
the
collar
of
*NL*
his
fur
coat
with
both
hands
,
and
muffling
him
up
in
it
.
``
She
's
a
nice
*NL*
girl
''
were
such
simple
,
humble
words
,
so
out
of
harmony
with
his
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
laughed
outright
a
merry
laugh
,
which
was
rare
with
*NL*
him
.
``
Well
,
anyway
,
I
may
say
that
I
'm
very
glad
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
may
do
tomorrow
,
tomorrow
and
nothing
more
!
Nothing
,
nothing
,
*NL*
silence
,
''
said
Levin
,
and
muffling
him
once
more
in
his
fur
coat
,
he
*NL*
added
:
``
I
do
like
you
so
!
Well
,
is
it
possible
for
me
to
be
present
at
*NL*
the
meeting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
discussion
about
today
?
''
asked
Levin
,
never
ceasing
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arrived
at
the
meeting
.
Levin
heard
the
secretary
hesitatingly
read
*NL*
the
minutes
which
he
obviously
did
not
himself
understand
;
but
Levin
saw
*NL*
from
this
secretary
's
face
what
a
good
,
nice
,
kind-hearted
person
he
*NL*
was
.
This
was
evident
from
his
confusion
and
embarrassment
in
reading
*NL*
the
minutes
.
Then
the
discussion
began
.
They
were
disputing
about
the
*NL*
misappropriation
of
certain
sums
and
the
laying
of
certain
pipes
,
and
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
very
cutting
to
two
members
,
and
said
something
at
*NL*
great
length
with
an
air
of
triumph
;
and
another
member
,
scribbling
*NL*
something
on
a
bit
of
paper
,
began
timidly
at
first
,
but
afterwards
*NL*
answered
him
very
viciously
and
delightfully
.
And
then
Sviazhsky
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
there
too
-RRB-
said
something
too
,
very
handsomely
and
nobly
.
Levin
listened
*NL*
to
them
,
and
saw
clearly
that
these
missing
sums
and
these
pipes
were
*NL*
not
anything
real
,
and
that
they
were
not
at
all
angry
,
but
were
all
the
*NL*
nicest
,
kindest
people
,
and
everything
was
as
happy
and
charming
as
*NL*
possible
among
them
.
They
did
no
harm
to
anyone
,
and
were
all
enjoying
*NL*
it
.
What
struck
Levin
was
that
he
could
see
through
them
all
today
,
and
*NL*
from
little
,
almost
imperceptible
signs
knew
the
soul
of
each
,
and
saw
*NL*
distinctly
that
they
were
all
good
at
heart
.
And
Levin
himself
in
*NL*
particular
they
were
all
extremely
fond
of
that
day
.
That
was
evident
*NL*
from
the
way
they
spoke
to
him
,
from
the
friendly
,
affectionate
way
even
*NL*
those
he
did
not
know
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
like
it
?
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
.
I
never
supposed
it
was
so
interesting
!
Capital
!
Splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
went
up
to
Levin
and
invited
him
to
come
round
to
tea
with
*NL*
him
.
Levin
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
or
recall
what
it
was
he
*NL*
had
disliked
in
Sviazhsky
,
what
he
had
failed
to
find
in
him
.
He
was
a
*NL*
clever
and
wonderfully
good-hearted
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
delighted
,
''
he
said
,
and
asked
after
his
wife
and
sister-in-law
.
*NL*
And
from
a
queer
association
of
ideas
,
because
in
his
imagination
the
*NL*
idea
of
Sviazhsky
's
sister-in-law
was
connected
with
marriage
,
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
could
more
suitably
*NL*
speak
of
his
happiness
,
and
he
was
very
glad
to
go
and
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
questioned
him
about
his
improvements
on
his
estate
,
*NL*
presupposing
,
as
he
always
did
,
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
doing
*NL*
anything
not
done
already
in
Europe
,
and
now
this
did
not
in
the
least
*NL*
annoy
Levin
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
felt
that
Sviazhsky
was
right
,
that
the
*NL*
whole
business
was
of
little
value
,
and
he
saw
the
wonderful
softness
*NL*
and
consideration
with
which
Sviazhsky
avoided
fully
expressing
his
*NL*
correct
view
.
The
ladies
of
the
Sviazhsky
household
were
particularly
*NL*
delightful
.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
they
knew
all
about
it
already
and
*NL*
sympathized
with
him
,
saying
nothing
merely
from
delicacy
.
He
stayed
*NL*
with
them
one
hour
,
two
,
three
,
talking
of
all
sorts
of
subjects
but
the
*NL*
one
thing
that
filled
his
heart
,
and
did
not
observe
that
he
was
boring
*NL*
them
dreadfully
,
and
that
it
was
long
past
their
bedtime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
went
with
him
into
the
hall
,
yawning
and
wondering
at
the
*NL*
strange
humor
his
friend
was
in
.
It
was
past
one
o'clock
.
Levin
went
*NL*
back
to
his
hotel
,
and
was
dismayed
at
the
thought
that
all
alone
now
*NL*
with
his
impatience
he
had
ten
hours
still
left
to
get
through
.
The
*NL*
servant
,
whose
turn
it
was
to
be
up
all
night
,
lighted
his
candles
,
and
*NL*
would
have
gone
away
,
but
Levin
stopped
him
.
This
servant
,
Yegor
,
whom
*NL*
Levin
had
noticed
before
,
struck
him
as
a
very
intelligent
,
excellent
,
*NL*
and
,
above
all
,
good-hearted
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Yegor
,
it
's
hard
work
not
sleeping
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
's
got
to
put
up
with
it
!
It
's
part
of
our
work
,
you
see
.
In
a
*NL*
gentleman
's
house
it
's
easier
;
but
then
here
one
makes
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
Yegor
had
a
family
,
three
boys
and
a
daughter
,
a
*NL*
sempstress
,
whom
he
wanted
to
marry
to
a
cashier
in
a
saddler
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
on
hearing
this
,
informed
Yegor
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
in
marriage
*NL*
the
great
thing
was
love
,
and
that
with
love
one
would
always
be
happy
,
*NL*
for
happiness
rests
only
on
oneself
.
Yegor
listened
attentively
,
and
*NL*
obviously
quite
took
in
Levin
's
idea
,
but
by
way
of
assent
to
it
he
*NL*
enunciated
,
greatly
to
Levin
's
surprise
,
the
observation
that
when
he
*NL*
had
lived
with
good
masters
he
had
always
been
satisfied
with
his
*NL*
masters
,
and
now
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
employer
,
though
he
*NL*
was
a
Frenchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wonderfully
good-hearted
fellow
!
''
thought
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
you
yourself
,
Yegor
,
when
you
got
married
,
did
you
love
your
*NL*
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
and
why
not
?
''
responded
Yegor
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
saw
that
Yegor
too
was
in
an
excited
state
and
intending
to
*NL*
express
all
his
most
heartfelt
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
,
too
,
has
been
a
wonderful
one
.
From
a
child
up
...
''
he
was
*NL*
beginning
with
flashing
eyes
,
apparently
catching
Levin
's
enthusiasm
,
*NL*
just
as
people
catch
yawning
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
a
ring
was
heard
.
Yegor
departed
,
and
Levin
was
left
*NL*
alone
.
He
had
eaten
scarcely
anything
at
dinner
,
had
refused
tea
and
*NL*
supper
at
Sviazhsky
's
,
but
he
was
incapable
of
thinking
of
supper
.
He
*NL*
had
not
slept
the
previous
night
,
but
was
incapable
of
thinking
of
sleep
*NL*
either
.
His
room
was
cold
,
but
he
was
oppressed
by
heat
.
He
opened
both
*NL*
the
movable
panes
in
his
window
and
sat
down
to
the
table
opposite
the
*NL*
open
panes
.
Over
the
snow-covered
roofs
could
be
seen
a
decorated
cross
*NL*
with
chains
,
and
above
it
the
rising
triangle
of
Charles
's
Wain
with
the
*NL*
yellowish
light
of
Capella
.
He
gazed
at
the
cross
,
then
at
the
stars
,
*NL*
drank
in
the
fresh
freezing
air
that
flowed
evenly
into
the
room
,
and
*NL*
followed
as
though
in
a
dream
the
images
and
memories
that
rose
in
his
*NL*
imagination
.
At
four
o'clock
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
and
peeped
*NL*
out
at
the
door
.
It
was
the
gambler
Myaskin
,
whom
he
knew
,
coming
from
*NL*
the
club
.
He
walked
gloomily
,
frowning
and
coughing
.
``
Poor
,
unlucky
*NL*
fellow
!
''
thought
Levin
,
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
from
love
and
pity
*NL*
for
this
man
.
He
would
have
talked
with
him
,
and
tried
to
comfort
him
,
*NL*
but
remembering
that
he
had
nothing
but
his
shirt
on
,
he
changed
his
*NL*
mind
and
sat
down
again
at
the
open
pane
to
bathe
in
the
cold
air
and
*NL*
gaze
at
the
exquisite
lines
of
the
cross
,
silent
,
but
full
of
meaning
*NL*
for
him
,
and
the
mounting
lurid
yellow
star
.
At
seven
o'clock
there
was
*NL*
a
noise
of
people
polishing
the
floors
,
and
bells
ringing
in
some
*NL*
servants
'
department
,
and
Levin
felt
that
he
was
beginning
to
get
*NL*
frozen
.
He
closed
the
pane
,
washed
,
dressed
,
and
went
out
into
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
streets
were
still
empty
.
Levin
went
to
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
.
The
visitors
'
doors
were
closed
and
everything
was
*NL*
asleep
.
He
walked
back
,
went
into
his
room
again
,
and
asked
for
coffee
.
*NL*
The
day
servant
,
not
Yegor
this
time
,
brought
it
to
him
.
Levin
would
*NL*
have
entered
into
conversation
with
him
,
but
a
bell
rang
for
the
*NL*
servant
,
and
he
went
out
.
Levin
tried
to
drink
coffee
and
put
some
roll
*NL*
in
his
mouth
,
but
his
mouth
was
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
do
with
the
*NL*
roll
.
Levin
,
rejecting
the
roll
,
put
on
his
coat
and
went
out
again
for
*NL*
a
walk
.
It
was
nine
o'clock
when
he
reached
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
steps
*NL*
the
second
time
.
In
the
house
they
were
only
just
up
,
and
the
cook
came
*NL*
out
to
go
marketing
.
He
had
to
get
through
at
least
two
hours
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
and
morning
Levin
lived
perfectly
unconsciously
,
and
felt
*NL*
perfectly
lifted
out
of
the
conditions
of
material
life
.
He
had
eaten
*NL*
nothing
for
a
whole
day
,
he
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
,
had
spent
*NL*
several
hours
undressed
in
the
frozen
air
,
and
felt
not
simply
fresher
*NL*
and
stronger
than
ever
,
but
felt
utterly
independent
of
his
body
;
he
*NL*
moved
without
muscular
effort
,
and
felt
as
if
he
could
do
anything
.
He
*NL*
was
convinced
he
could
fly
upwards
or
lift
the
corner
of
the
house
,
if
*NL*
need
be
.
He
spent
the
remainder
of
the
time
in
the
street
,
incessantly
*NL*
looking
at
his
watch
and
gazing
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
he
saw
then
,
he
never
saw
again
after
.
The
children
especially
*NL*
going
to
school
,
the
bluish
doves
flying
down
from
the
roofs
to
the
*NL*
pavement
,
and
the
little
loaves
covered
with
flour
,
thrust
out
by
an
*NL*
unseen
hand
,
touched
him
.
Those
loaves
,
those
doves
,
and
those
two
boys
*NL*
were
not
earthly
creatures
.
It
all
happened
at
the
same
time
:
a
boy
ran
*NL*
towards
a
dove
and
glanced
smiling
at
Levin
;
the
dove
,
with
a
whir
of
*NL*
her
wings
,
darted
away
,
flashing
in
the
sun
,
amid
grains
of
snow
that
*NL*
quivered
in
the
air
,
while
from
a
little
window
there
came
a
smell
of
*NL*
fresh-baked
bread
,
and
the
loaves
were
put
out
.
All
of
this
together
was
*NL*
so
extraordinarily
nice
that
Levin
laughed
and
cried
with
delight
.
Going
*NL*
a
long
way
round
by
Gazetny
Place
and
Kislovka
,
he
went
back
again
to
*NL*
the
hotel
,
and
putting
his
watch
before
him
,
he
sat
down
to
wait
for
*NL*
twelve
o'clock
.
In
the
next
room
they
were
talking
about
some
sort
of
*NL*
machines
,
and
swindling
,
and
coughing
their
morning
coughs
.
They
did
not
*NL*
realize
that
the
hand
was
near
twelve
.
The
hand
reached
it
.
Levin
went
*NL*
out
onto
the
steps
.
The
sledge-drivers
clearly
knew
all
about
it
.
They
*NL*
crowded
round
Levin
with
happy
faces
,
quarreling
among
themselves
,
and
*NL*
offering
their
services
.
Trying
not
to
offend
the
other
sledge
drivers
,
*NL*
and
promising
to
drive
with
them
too
,
Levin
took
one
and
told
him
to
*NL*
drive
to
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
.
The
sledge-driver
was
splendid
in
a
white
*NL*
shirt-collar
sticking
out
over
his
overcoat
and
into
his
strong
,
*NL*
full-blooded
red
neck
.
The
sledge
was
high
and
comfortable
,
and
*NL*
altogether
such
a
one
as
Levin
never
drove
in
after
,
and
the
horse
was
a
*NL*
good
one
,
and
tried
to
gallop
but
did
n't
seem
to
move
.
The
driver
knew
*NL*
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
,
and
drew
up
at
the
entrance
with
a
curve
of
*NL*
his
arm
and
a
``
Wo
!
''
especially
indicative
of
respect
for
his
fare
.
The
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
hall-porter
certainly
knew
all
about
it
.
This
was
*NL*
evident
from
the
smile
in
his
eyes
and
the
way
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
a
long
while
since
you
've
been
to
see
us
,
Konstantin
*NL*
Demitrievitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
he
knew
all
about
it
,
but
he
was
unmistakably
delighted
and
*NL*
making
efforts
to
conceal
his
joy
.
Looking
into
his
kindly
old
eyes
,
*NL*
Levin
realized
even
something
new
in
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
walk
in
!
Leave
it
here
,
''
said
he
,
smiling
,
as
Levin
would
have
*NL*
come
back
to
take
his
hat
.
That
meant
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
whom
shall
I
announce
your
honor
?
''
asked
the
footman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
,
though
a
young
man
,
and
one
of
the
new
school
of
footmen
,
a
*NL*
dandy
,
was
a
very
kind-hearted
,
good
fellow
,
and
he
too
knew
all
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
princess
...
the
prince
...
the
young
princess
...
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
person
he
saw
was
Mademoiselle
Linon
.
She
walked
across
the
*NL*
room
,
and
her
ringlets
and
her
face
were
beaming
.
He
had
only
just
*NL*
spoken
to
her
,
when
suddenly
he
heard
the
rustle
of
a
skirt
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
Mademoiselle
Linon
vanished
from
Levin
's
eyes
,
and
a
joyful
terror
*NL*
came
over
him
at
the
nearness
of
his
happiness
.
Mademoiselle
Linon
was
*NL*
in
great
haste
,
and
leaving
him
,
went
out
at
the
other
door
.
Directly
*NL*
she
had
gone
out
,
swift
,
swift
light
steps
sounded
on
the
parquet
,
and
*NL*
his
bliss
,
his
life
,
himself
--
what
was
best
in
himself
,
what
he
had
so
*NL*
long
sought
and
longed
for
--
was
quickly
,
so
quickly
approaching
him
.
She
*NL*
did
not
walk
,
but
seemed
,
by
some
unseen
force
,
to
float
to
him
.
He
saw
*NL*
nothing
but
her
clear
,
truthful
eyes
,
frightened
by
the
same
bliss
of
*NL*
love
that
flooded
his
heart
.
Those
eyes
were
shining
nearer
and
nearer
,
*NL*
blinding
him
with
their
light
of
love
.
She
stopped
still
close
to
him
,
*NL*
touching
him
.
Her
hands
rose
and
dropped
onto
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
done
all
she
could
--
she
had
run
up
to
him
and
given
herself
up
*NL*
entirely
,
shy
and
happy
.
He
put
his
arms
round
her
and
pressed
his
lips
*NL*
to
her
mouth
that
sought
his
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
too
had
not
slept
all
night
,
and
had
been
expecting
him
all
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
and
father
had
consented
without
demur
,
and
were
happy
in
her
*NL*
happiness
.
She
had
been
waiting
for
him
.
She
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
*NL*
tell
him
her
happiness
and
his
.
She
had
got
ready
to
see
him
alone
,
and
*NL*
had
been
delighted
at
the
idea
,
and
had
been
shy
and
ashamed
,
and
did
*NL*
not
know
herself
what
she
was
doing
.
She
had
heard
his
steps
and
voice
,
*NL*
and
had
waited
at
the
door
for
Mademoiselle
Linon
to
go
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Linon
had
gone
away
.
Without
thinking
,
without
asking
herself
how
and
*NL*
what
,
she
had
gone
up
to
him
,
and
did
as
she
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
mamma
!
''
she
said
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
.
For
a
long
while
*NL*
he
could
say
nothing
,
not
so
much
because
he
was
afraid
of
desecrating
*NL*
the
loftiness
of
his
emotion
by
a
word
,
as
that
every
time
he
tried
to
*NL*
say
something
,
instead
of
words
he
felt
that
tears
of
happiness
were
*NL*
welling
up
.
He
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
true
?
''
he
said
at
last
in
a
choked
voice
.
``
I
ca
n't
believe
*NL*
you
love
me
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
at
that
``
dear
,
''
and
at
the
timidity
with
which
he
glanced
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
said
significantly
,
deliberately
.
``
I
am
so
happy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
letting
go
his
hands
,
she
went
into
the
drawing
room
.
The
princess
,
*NL*
seeing
them
,
breathed
quickly
,
and
immediately
began
to
cry
and
then
*NL*
immediately
began
to
laugh
,
and
with
a
vigorous
step
Levin
had
not
*NL*
expected
,
ran
up
to
him
,
and
hugging
his
head
,
kissed
him
,
wetting
his
*NL*
cheeks
with
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
all
settled
!
I
am
glad
.
Love
her
.
I
am
glad
...
Kitty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
been
long
settling
things
,
''
said
the
old
prince
,
trying
to
*NL*
seem
unmoved
;
but
Levin
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
wet
when
he
turned
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
long
,
always
wished
for
this
!
''
said
the
prince
,
taking
Levin
by
*NL*
the
arm
and
drawing
him
towards
himself
.
``
Even
when
this
little
*NL*
feather-head
fancied
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Papa
!
''
shrieked
Kitty
,
and
shut
his
mouth
with
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
very
,
very
...
plea
...
Oh
,
what
a
fool
I
*NL*
am
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
embraced
Kitty
,
kissed
her
face
,
her
hand
,
her
face
again
,
and
made
*NL*
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
came
over
Levin
a
new
feeling
of
love
for
this
man
,
till
then
*NL*
so
little
known
to
him
,
when
he
saw
how
slowly
and
tenderly
Kitty
kissed
*NL*
his
muscular
hand
.

Kitty
stood
by
her
father
's
chair
,
still
holding
his
*NL*
hand
.
All
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
was
the
first
to
put
everything
into
words
,
and
to
*NL*
translate
all
thoughts
and
feelings
into
practical
questions
.
And
all
*NL*
equally
felt
this
strange
and
painful
for
the
first
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
it
to
be
?
We
must
have
the
benediction
and
announcement
.
And
*NL*
when
's
the
wedding
to
be
?
What
do
you
think
,
Alexander
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
,
''
said
the
old
prince
,
pointing
to
Levin
--
``
he
's
the
*NL*
principal
person
in
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
said
Levin
blushing
.
``
Tomorrow
;
If
you
ask
me
,
I
should
say
,
the
*NL*
benediction
today
and
the
wedding
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
_
mon
cher
_
,
that
's
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
quite
mad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
upon
my
word
!
''
said
the
mother
,
smiling
,
delighted
at
this
haste
.
*NL*
``
How
about
the
trousseau
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
there
really
be
a
trousseau
and
all
that
?
''
Levin
thought
with
*NL*
horror
.
``
But
can
the
trousseau
and
the
benediction
and
all
that
--
can
it
*NL*
spoil
my
happiness
?
Nothing
can
spoil
it
!
''
He
glanced
at
Kitty
,
and
*NL*
noticed
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
,
not
in
the
very
least
,
disturbed
*NL*
by
the
idea
of
the
trousseau
.
``
Then
it
must
be
all
right
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
nothing
about
it
;
I
only
said
what
I
should
like
,
''
he
said
*NL*
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
talk
it
over
,
then
.
The
benediction
and
announcement
can
take
*NL*
place
now
.
That
's
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
went
up
to
her
husband
,
kissed
him
,
and
would
have
gone
*NL*
away
,
but
he
kept
her
,
embraced
her
,
and
,
tenderly
as
a
young
lover
,
*NL*
kissed
her
several
times
,
smiling
.
The
old
people
were
obviously
muddled
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
did
not
quite
know
whether
it
was
they
who
were
in
*NL*
love
again
or
their
daughter
.
When
the
prince
and
the
princess
had
gone
,
*NL*
Levin
went
up
to
his
betrothed
and
took
her
hand
.
He
was
self-possessed
*NL*
now
and
could
speak
,
and
he
had
a
great
deal
he
wanted
to
tell
her
.
But
*NL*
he
said
not
at
all
what
he
had
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
knew
it
would
be
so
!
I
never
hoped
for
it
;
and
yet
in
my
heart
I
*NL*
was
always
sure
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
believe
that
it
was
ordained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
!
''
she
said
.
``
Even
when
...
''
She
stopped
and
went
on
again
,
*NL*
looking
at
him
resolutely
with
her
truthful
eyes
,
``
Even
when
I
thrust
*NL*
from
me
my
happiness
.
I
always
loved
you
alone
,
but
I
was
carried
away
.
*NL*
I
ought
to
tell
you
...
Can
you
forgive
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
for
the
best
.
You
will
have
to
forgive
me
so
much
.
I
*NL*
ought
to
tell
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
one
of
the
things
he
had
meant
to
speak
about
.
He
had
resolved
*NL*
from
the
first
to
tell
her
two
things
--
that
he
was
not
chaste
as
she
*NL*
was
,
and
that
he
was
not
a
believer
.
It
was
agonizing
,
but
he
considered
*NL*
he
ought
to
tell
her
both
these
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
now
,
later
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
later
,
but
you
must
certainly
tell
me
.
I
'm
not
afraid
of
*NL*
anything
.
I
want
to
know
everything
.
Now
it
is
settled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
:
``
Settled
that
you
'll
take
me
whatever
I
may
be
--
you
wo
n't
give
*NL*
me
up
?
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
Mademoiselle
Linon
,
who
with
an
*NL*
affected
but
tender
smile
came
to
congratulate
her
favorite
pupil
.
*NL*
Before
she
had
gone
,
the
servants
came
in
with
their
congratulations
.
*NL*
Then
relations
arrived
,
and
there
began
that
state
of
blissful
absurdity
*NL*
from
which
Levin
did
not
emerge
till
the
day
after
his
wedding
.
Levin
*NL*
was
in
a
continual
state
of
awkwardness
and
discomfort
,
but
the
*NL*
intensity
of
his
happiness
went
on
all
the
while
increasing
.
He
felt
*NL*
continually
that
a
great
deal
was
being
expected
of
him
--
what
,
he
did
*NL*
not
know
;
and
he
did
everything
he
was
told
,
and
it
all
gave
him
*NL*
happiness
.
He
had
thought
his
engagement
would
have
nothing
about
it
*NL*
like
others
,
that
the
ordinary
conditions
of
engaged
couples
would
spoil
*NL*
his
special
happiness
;
but
it
ended
in
his
doing
exactly
as
other
people
*NL*
did
,
and
his
happiness
being
only
increased
thereby
and
becoming
more
*NL*
and
more
special
,
more
and
more
unlike
anything
that
had
ever
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
shall
have
sweetmeats
to
eat
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
Linon
--
and
*NL*
Levin
drove
off
to
buy
sweetmeats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
very
glad
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
``
I
advise
you
to
get
the
bouquets
*NL*
from
Fomin
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
they
wanted
?
''
And
he
drove
to
Fomin
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
offered
to
lend
him
money
,
as
he
would
have
so
many
*NL*
expenses
,
presents
to
give
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
presents
wanted
?
''
And
he
galloped
to
Foulde
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
confectioner
's
,
and
at
Fomin
's
,
and
at
Foulde
's
he
saw
that
*NL*
he
was
expected
;
that
they
were
pleased
to
see
him
,
and
prided
*NL*
themselves
on
his
happiness
,
just
as
every
one
whom
he
had
to
do
with
*NL*
during
those
days
.
What
was
extraordinary
was
that
everyone
not
only
*NL*
liked
him
,
but
even
people
previously
unsympathetic
,
cold
,
and
callous
,
*NL*
were
enthusiastic
over
him
,
gave
way
to
him
in
everything
,
treated
his
*NL*
feeling
with
tenderness
and
delicacy
,
and
shared
his
conviction
that
he
*NL*
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
because
his
betrothed
was
beyond
*NL*
perfection
.
Kitty
too
felt
the
same
thing
.
When
Countess
Nordston
*NL*
ventured
to
hint
that
she
had
hoped
for
something
better
,
Kitty
was
so
*NL*
angry
and
proved
so
conclusively
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
*NL*
better
than
Levin
,
that
Countess
Nordston
had
to
admit
it
,
and
in
*NL*
Kitty
's
presence
never
met
Levin
without
a
smile
of
ecstatic
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
confession
he
had
promised
was
the
one
painful
incident
of
this
*NL*
time
.
He
consulted
the
old
prince
,
and
with
his
sanction
gave
Kitty
his
*NL*
diary
,
in
which
there
was
written
the
confession
that
tortured
him
.
He
*NL*
had
written
this
diary
at
the
time
with
a
view
to
his
future
wife
.
Two
*NL*
things
caused
him
anguish
:
his
lack
of
purity
and
his
lack
of
faith
.
His
*NL*
confession
of
unbelief
passed
unnoticed
.
She
was
religious
,
had
never
*NL*
doubted
the
truths
of
religion
,
but
his
external
unbelief
did
not
affect
*NL*
her
in
the
least
.
Through
love
she
knew
all
his
soul
,
and
in
his
soul
*NL*
she
saw
what
she
wanted
,
and
that
such
a
state
of
soul
should
be
called
*NL*
unbelieving
was
to
her
a
matter
of
no
account
.
The
other
confession
set
*NL*
her
weeping
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
not
without
an
inner
struggle
,
handed
her
his
diary
.
He
knew
that
*NL*
between
him
and
her
there
could
not
be
,
and
should
not
be
,
secrets
,
and
*NL*
so
he
had
decided
that
so
it
must
be
.
But
he
had
not
realized
what
an
*NL*
effect
it
would
have
on
her
,
he
had
not
put
himself
in
her
place
.
It
was
*NL*
only
when
the
same
evening
he
came
to
their
house
before
the
theater
,
*NL*
went
into
her
room
and
saw
her
tear-stained
,
pitiful
,
sweet
face
,
*NL*
miserable
with
suffering
he
had
caused
and
nothing
could
undo
,
he
felt
*NL*
the
abyss
that
separated
his
shameful
past
from
her
dovelike
purity
,
and
*NL*
was
appalled
at
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
them
,
take
these
dreadful
books
!
''
she
said
,
pushing
away
the
*NL*
notebooks
lying
before
her
on
the
table
.
``
Why
did
you
give
them
me
?
No
,
*NL*
it
was
better
anyway
,
''
she
added
,
touched
by
his
despairing
face
.
``
But
*NL*
it
's
awful
,
awful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
sank
,
and
he
was
silent
.
He
could
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
forgive
me
,
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
forgive
you
;
but
it
's
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
happiness
was
so
immense
that
this
confession
did
not
shatter
*NL*
it
,
it
only
added
another
shade
to
it
.
She
forgave
him
;
but
from
that
*NL*
time
more
than
ever
he
considered
himself
unworthy
of
her
,
morally
bowed
*NL*
down
lower
than
ever
before
her
,
and
prized
more
highly
than
ever
his
*NL*
undeserved
happiness
.

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Unconsciously
going
over
in
his
memory
the
conversations
that
had
taken
*NL*
place
during
and
after
dinner
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
returned
to
his
*NL*
solitary
room
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
words
about
forgiveness
had
aroused
*NL*
in
him
nothing
but
annoyance
.
The
applicability
or
non-applicability
of
*NL*
the
Christian
precept
to
his
own
case
was
too
difficult
a
question
to
be
*NL*
discussed
lightly
,
and
this
question
had
long
ago
been
answered
by
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
in
the
negative
.
Of
all
that
had
been
said
,
what
*NL*
stuck
most
in
his
memory
was
the
phrase
of
stupid
,
good-natured
*NL*
Turovtsin
--
''
_
Acted
like
a
man
,
he
did
!
Called
him
out
and
shot
him
!
_
''
*NL*
Everyone
had
apparently
shared
this
feeling
,
though
from
politeness
they
*NL*
had
not
expressed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
matter
is
settled
,
it
's
useless
thinking
about
it
,
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
told
himself
.
And
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
journey
*NL*
before
him
,
and
the
revision
work
he
had
to
do
,
he
went
into
his
room
*NL*
and
asked
the
porter
who
escorted
him
where
his
man
was
.
The
porter
said
*NL*
that
the
man
had
only
just
gone
out
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
ordered
tea
*NL*
to
be
sent
him
,
sat
down
to
the
table
,
and
taking
the
guidebook
,
began
*NL*
considering
the
route
of
his
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
telegrams
,
''
said
his
manservant
,
coming
into
the
room
.
``
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
your
excellency
;
I
'd
only
just
that
minute
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
the
telegrams
and
opened
them
.
The
first
*NL*
telegram
was
the
announcement
of
Stremov
's
appointment
to
the
very
post
*NL*
Karenin
had
coveted
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
flung
the
telegram
down
,
and
*NL*
flushing
a
little
,
got
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
.
''
_
Quos
*NL*
vult
perdere
dementat
_
,
''
he
said
,
meaning
by
_
quos
_
the
persons
*NL*
responsible
for
this
appointment
.
He
was
not
so
much
annoyed
that
he
had
*NL*
not
received
the
post
,
that
he
had
been
conspicuously
passed
over
;
but
*NL*
it
was
incomprehensible
,
amazing
to
him
that
they
did
not
see
that
the
*NL*
wordy
phrase-monger
Stremov
was
the
last
man
fit
for
it
.
How
could
they
*NL*
fail
to
see
how
they
were
ruining
themselves
,
lowering
their
_
prestige
_
*NL*
by
this
appointment
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
else
in
the
same
line
,
''
he
said
to
himself
bitterly
,
opening
*NL*
the
second
telegram
.
The
telegram
was
from
his
wife
.
Her
name
,
written
*NL*
in
blue
pencil
,
``
Anna
,
''
was
the
first
thing
that
caught
his
eye
.
``
I
am
*NL*
dying
;
I
beg
,
I
implore
you
to
come
.
I
shall
die
easier
with
your
*NL*
forgiveness
,
''
he
read
.
He
smiled
contemptuously
,
and
flung
down
the
*NL*
telegram
.
That
this
was
a
trick
and
a
fraud
,
of
that
,
he
thought
for
the
*NL*
first
minute
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
deceit
she
would
stick
at
.
She
was
near
her
confinement
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
is
the
confinement
.
But
what
can
be
their
aim
?
To
legitimize
*NL*
the
child
,
to
compromise
me
,
and
prevent
a
divorce
,
''
he
thought
.
``
But
*NL*
something
was
said
in
it
:
I
am
dying
...
''
He
read
the
telegram
again
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
the
plain
meaning
of
what
was
said
in
it
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
is
true
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
If
it
is
true
that
in
the
*NL*
moment
of
agony
and
nearness
to
death
she
is
genuinely
penitent
,
and
I
,
*NL*
taking
it
for
a
trick
,
refuse
to
go
?
That
would
not
only
be
cruel
,
and
*NL*
everyone
would
blame
me
,
but
it
would
be
stupid
on
my
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Piotr
,
call
a
coach
;
I
am
going
to
Petersburg
,
''
he
said
to
his
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
decided
that
he
would
go
to
Petersburg
and
see
his
*NL*
wife
.
If
her
illness
was
a
trick
,
he
would
say
nothing
and
go
away
*NL*
again
.
If
she
was
really
in
danger
,
and
wished
to
see
him
before
her
*NL*
death
,
he
would
forgive
her
if
he
found
her
alive
,
and
pay
her
the
last
*NL*
duties
if
he
came
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
he
thought
no
more
of
what
he
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sense
of
weariness
and
uncleanness
from
the
night
spent
in
the
*NL*
train
,
in
the
early
fog
of
Petersburg
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
drove
*NL*
through
the
deserted
Nevsky
and
stared
straight
before
him
,
not
thinking
*NL*
of
what
was
awaiting
him
.
He
could
not
think
about
it
,
because
in
*NL*
picturing
what
would
happen
,
he
could
not
drive
away
the
reflection
that
*NL*
her
death
would
at
once
remove
all
the
difficulty
of
his
position
.
*NL*
Bakers
,
closed
shops
,
night-cabmen
,
porters
sweeping
the
pavements
*NL*
flashed
past
his
eyes
,
and
he
watched
it
all
,
trying
to
smother
the
*NL*
thought
of
what
was
awaiting
him
,
and
what
he
dared
not
hope
for
,
and
*NL*
yet
was
hoping
for
.
He
drove
up
to
the
steps
.
A
sledge
and
a
carriage
*NL*
with
the
coachman
asleep
stood
at
the
entrance
.
As
he
went
into
the
*NL*
entry
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
as
it
were
,
got
out
his
resolution
from
*NL*
the
remotest
corner
of
his
brain
,
and
mastered
it
thoroughly
.
Its
*NL*
meaning
ran
:
``
If
it
's
a
trick
,
then
calm
contempt
and
departure
.
If
*NL*
truth
,
do
what
is
proper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
opened
the
door
before
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
rang
.
The
*NL*
porter
,
Kapitonitch
,
looked
queer
in
an
old
coat
,
without
a
tie
,
and
in
*NL*
slippers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your
mistress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
successful
confinement
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stopped
short
and
turned
white
.
He
felt
distinctly
*NL*
now
how
intensely
he
had
longed
for
her
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Korney
in
his
morning
apron
ran
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
ill
,
''
he
answered
.
``
There
was
a
consultation
yesterday
,
and
the
*NL*
doctor
's
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
my
things
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
feeling
some
relief
at
*NL*
the
news
that
there
was
still
hope
of
her
death
,
he
went
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
hatstand
there
was
a
military
overcoat
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
noticed
it
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
,
the
midwife
,
and
Count
Vronsky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
into
the
inner
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing
room
there
was
no
one
;
at
the
sound
of
his
steps
there
*NL*
came
out
of
her
boudoir
the
midwife
in
a
cap
with
lilac
ribbons
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
with
the
familiarity
given
by
*NL*
the
approach
of
death
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
towards
the
*NL*
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
you
've
come
!
She
keeps
on
about
you
and
nothing
but
you
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
with
the
ice
!
''
the
doctor
's
peremptory
voice
said
from
the
*NL*
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
into
her
boudoir
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
table
,
sitting
sideways
in
a
low
chair
,
was
Vronsky
,
his
face
*NL*
hidden
in
his
hands
,
weeping
.
He
jumped
up
at
the
doctor
's
voice
,
took
*NL*
his
hands
from
his
face
,
and
saw
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
Seeing
the
*NL*
husband
,
he
was
so
overwhelmed
that
he
sat
down
again
,
drawing
his
head
*NL*
down
to
his
shoulders
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
disappear
;
but
he
made
an
*NL*
effort
over
himself
,
got
up
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dying
.
The
doctors
say
there
is
no
hope
.
I
am
entirely
in
your
*NL*
power
,
only
let
me
be
here
...
though
I
am
at
your
disposal
.
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
seeing
Vronsky
's
tears
,
felt
a
rush
of
that
*NL*
nervous
emotion
always
produced
in
him
by
the
sight
of
other
people
's
*NL*
suffering
,
and
turning
away
his
face
,
he
moved
hurriedly
to
the
door
,
*NL*
without
hearing
the
rest
of
his
words
.
From
the
bedroom
came
the
sound
*NL*
of
Anna
's
voice
saying
something
.
Her
voice
was
lively
,
eager
,
with
*NL*
exceedingly
distinct
intonations
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
into
the
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
went
up
to
the
bed
.
She
was
lying
turned
with
her
face
*NL*
towards
him
.
Her
cheeks
were
flushed
crimson
,
her
eyes
glittered
,
her
*NL*
little
white
hands
thrust
out
from
the
sleeves
of
her
dressing
gown
were
*NL*
playing
with
the
quilt
,
twisting
it
about
.
It
seemed
as
though
she
were
*NL*
not
only
well
and
blooming
,
but
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
.
She
was
*NL*
talking
rapidly
,
musically
,
and
with
exceptionally
correct
articulation
*NL*
and
expressive
intonation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Alexey
--
I
am
speaking
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
-LRB-
what
a
strange
and
*NL*
awful
thing
that
both
are
Alexey
,
is
n't
it
?
-RRB-
--
Alexey
would
not
refuse
*NL*
me
.
I
should
forget
,
he
would
forgive
...
But
why
does
n't
he
come
?
He
's
*NL*
so
good
he
does
n't
know
himself
how
good
he
is

Ah
,
my
God
,
what
agony
!
*NL*
Give
me
some
water

quick

Oh

that
will
be
bad
for
her

my
little
girl

*NL*
Oh

very
well
then
,
give
her
to
a
nurse

Yes
,
I
agree
,
it
's
better
in
*NL*
fact

He
'll
be
coming

it
will
hurt
him

nurse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
he
has
come

Here
he
is

said
the
midwife
,
trying
to
*NL*
attract
her
attention
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
nonsense
!
''
Anna
went
on
,
not
seeing
her
husband
.
``
No

give
her
*NL*
to
me
;
give
me
my
little
one

He
has
not
come
yet

You
say
he
wo
n't
*NL*
forgive
me
,
because
you
do
n't
know
him
.
No
one
knows
him
.
I
'm
the
only
*NL*
one
,
and
it
was
hard
for
me
even
.
His
eyes
I
ought
to
know
--
Seryozha
has
*NL*
just
the
same
eyes
--
and
I
ca
n't
bear
to
see
them
because
of
it

Has
*NL*
Seryozha
had
his
dinner
?
I
know
everyone
will
forget
him
.
He
would
not
*NL*
forget
.
Seryozha
must
be
moved
into
the
corner
room
,
and
Mariette
must
*NL*
be
asked
to
sleep
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
she
shrank
back
,
was
silent
;
and
in
terror
,
as
though
*NL*
expecting
a
blow
,
as
though
to
defend
herself
,
she
raised
her
hands
to
*NL*
her
face
.
She
had
seen
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
she
began
.
``
I
am
not
afraid
of
him
;
I
am
afraid
of
death

*NL*
Alexey

come
here

I
am
in
a
hurry
,
because
I
've
no
time

I
've
not
long
*NL*
left
to
live
;
the
fever
will
begin
directly
and
I
shall
understand
*NL*
nothing
more

Now
I
understand
,
I
understand
it
all
,
I
see
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
wrinkled
face
wore
an
expression
of
agony
;
he
*NL*
took
her
by
the
hand
and
tried
to
say
something
,
but
he
could
not
utter
*NL*
it
;
his
lower
lip
quivered
,
but
he
still
went
on
struggling
with
his
*NL*
emotion
,
and
only
now
and
then
glanced
at
her
.
And
each
time
he
glanced
*NL*
at
her
,
he
saw
her
eyes
gazing
at
him
with
such
passionate
and
*NL*
triumphant
tenderness
as
he
had
never
seen
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
you
do
n't
know
...
stay
a
little
,
stay
!
...
''
She
stopped
,
*NL*
as
though
collecting
her
ideas
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
began
;
``
yes
,
yes
,
yes
.
This
*NL*
is
what
I
wanted
to
say
.
Do
n't
be
surprised
at
me
.
I
'm
still
the
*NL*
same
...
But
there
is
another
woman
in
me
,
I
'm
afraid
of
her
:
she
loved
*NL*
that
man
,
and
I
tried
to
hate
you
,
and
could
not
forget
about
her
that
*NL*
used
to
be
.
I
'm
not
that
woman
.
Now
I
'm
my
real
self
,
all
myself
.
I
'm
*NL*
dying
now
,
I
know
I
shall
die
,
ask
him
.
Even
now
I
feel
--
see
here
,
the
*NL*
weights
on
my
feet
,
on
my
hands
,
on
my
fingers
.
My
fingers
--
see
how
huge
*NL*
they
are
!
But
this
will
soon
all
be
over
...
Only
one
thing
I
want
:
*NL*
forgive
me
,
forgive
me
quite
.
I
'm
terrible
,
but
my
nurse
used
to
tell
*NL*
me
;
the
holy
martyr
--
what
was
her
name
?
She
was
worse
.
And
I
'll
go
to
*NL*
Rome
;
there
's
a
wilderness
,
and
there
I
shall
be
no
trouble
to
any
one
,
*NL*
only
I
'll
take
Seryozha
and
the
little
one
...
No
,
you
ca
n't
forgive
me
!
*NL*
I
know
,
it
ca
n't
be
forgiven
!
No
,
no
,
go
away
,
you
're
too
good
!
''
She
*NL*
held
his
hand
in
one
burning
hand
,
while
she
pushed
him
away
with
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nervous
agitation
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
kept
increasing
,
and
had
*NL*
by
now
reached
such
a
point
that
he
ceased
to
struggle
with
it
.
He
*NL*
suddenly
felt
that
what
he
had
regarded
as
nervous
agitation
was
on
the
*NL*
contrary
a
blissful
spiritual
condition
that
gave
him
all
at
once
a
new
*NL*
happiness
he
had
never
known
.
He
did
not
think
that
the
Christian
law
*NL*
that
he
had
been
all
his
life
trying
to
follow
,
enjoined
on
him
to
*NL*
forgive
and
love
his
enemies
;
but
a
glad
feeling
of
love
and
forgiveness
*NL*
for
his
enemies
filled
his
heart
.
He
knelt
down
,
and
laying
his
head
in
*NL*
the
curve
of
her
arm
,
which
burned
him
as
with
fire
through
the
sleeve
,
*NL*
he
sobbed
like
a
little
child
.
She
put
her
arm
around
his
head
,
moved
*NL*
towards
him
,
and
with
defiant
pride
lifted
up
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
he
.
I
knew
him
!
Now
,
forgive
me
,
everyone
,
forgive
me
!
...
*NL*
They
've
come
again
;
why
do
n't
they
go
away
?
...
Oh
,
take
these
cloaks
off
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
unloosed
her
hands
,
carefully
laying
her
on
the
pillow
,
and
*NL*
covered
her
up
to
the
shoulders
.
She
lay
back
submissively
,
and
looked
*NL*
before
her
with
beaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
one
thing
,
that
I
needed
nothing
but
forgiveness
,
and
I
want
*NL*
nothing
more
...
Why
does
n't
_
he
_
come
?
''
she
said
,
turning
to
the
door
*NL*
towards
Vronsky
.
``
Do
come
,
do
come
!
Give
him
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
came
to
the
side
of
the
bed
,
and
seeing
Anna
,
again
hid
his
face
*NL*
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncover
your
face
--
look
at
him
!
He
's
a
saint
,
''
she
said
.
``
Oh
!
uncover
*NL*
your
face
,
do
uncover
it
!
''
she
said
angrily
.
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
do
*NL*
uncover
his
face
!
I
want
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
Vronsky
's
hands
and
drew
them
away
from
his
*NL*
face
,
which
was
awful
with
the
expression
of
agony
and
shame
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
your
hand
.
Forgive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
gave
him
his
hand
,
not
attempting
to
restrain
the
*NL*
tears
that
streamed
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
thank
God
!
''
she
said
,
``
now
everything
is
ready
.
Only
to
*NL*
stretch
my
legs
a
little
.
There
,
that
's
capital
.
How
badly
these
flowers
*NL*
are
done
--
not
a
bit
like
a
violet
,
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
the
hangings
.
*NL*
``
My
God
,
my
God
!
when
will
it
end
?
Give
me
some
morphine
.
Doctor
,
give
*NL*
me
some
morphine
!
Oh
,
my
God
,
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
tossed
about
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctors
said
that
it
was
puerperal
fever
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
ninety-nine
chances
in
a
hundred
it
would
end
in
death
.
The
whole
day
*NL*
long
there
was
fever
,
delirium
,
and
unconsciousness
.
At
midnight
the
*NL*
patient
lay
without
consciousness
,
and
almost
without
pulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
was
expected
every
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
gone
home
,
but
in
the
morning
he
came
to
inquire
,
and
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
meeting
him
in
the
hall
,
said
:
``
Better
stay
,
she
might
*NL*
ask
for
you
,
''
and
himself
led
him
to
his
wife
's
boudoir
.
Towards
*NL*
morning
,
there
was
a
return
again
of
excitement
,
rapid
thought
and
talk
,
*NL*
and
again
it
ended
in
unconsciousness
.
On
the
third
day
it
was
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
and
the
doctors
said
there
was
hope
.
That
day
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
went
into
the
boudoir
where
Vronsky
was
sitting
,
and
*NL*
closing
the
door
sat
down
opposite
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
feeling
that
a
statement
of
the
*NL*
position
was
coming
,
``
I
ca
n't
speak
,
I
ca
n't
understand
.
Spare
me
!
*NL*
However
hard
it
is
for
you
,
believe
me
,
it
is
more
terrible
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
risen
;
but
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
him
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
hear
me
out
;
it
is
necessary
.
I
must
explain
my
feelings
,
*NL*
the
feelings
that
have
guided
me
and
will
guide
me
,
so
that
you
may
not
*NL*
be
in
error
regarding
me
.
You
know
I
had
resolved
on
a
divorce
,
and
had
*NL*
even
begun
to
take
proceedings
.
I
wo
n't
conceal
from
you
that
in
*NL*
beginning
this
I
was
in
uncertainty
,
I
was
in
misery
;
I
will
confess
*NL*
that
I
was
pursued
by
a
desire
to
revenge
myself
on
you
and
on
her
.
When
*NL*
I
got
the
telegram
,
I
came
here
with
the
same
feelings
;
I
will
say
more
,
*NL*
I
longed
for
her
death
.
But
...
''
He
paused
,
pondering
whether
to
*NL*
disclose
or
not
to
disclose
his
feeling
to
him
.
``
But
I
saw
her
and
*NL*
forgave
her
.
And
the
happiness
of
forgiveness
has
revealed
to
me
my
*NL*
duty
.
I
forgive
completely
.
I
would
offer
the
other
cheek
,
I
would
give
*NL*
my
cloak
if
my
coat
be
taken
.
I
pray
to
God
only
not
to
take
from
me
the
*NL*
bliss
of
forgiveness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
stood
in
his
eyes
,
and
the
luminous
,
serene
look
in
them
impressed
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
position
:
you
can
trample
me
in
the
mud
,
make
me
the
*NL*
laughing-stock
of
the
world
,
I
will
not
abandon
her
,
and
I
will
never
*NL*
utter
a
word
of
reproach
to
you
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
went
on
.
``
My
*NL*
duty
is
clearly
marked
for
me
;
I
ought
to
be
with
her
,
and
I
will
be
.
If
*NL*
she
wishes
to
see
you
,
I
will
let
you
know
,
but
now
I
suppose
it
would
*NL*
be
better
for
you
to
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
,
and
sobs
cut
short
his
words
.
Vronsky
too
was
getting
up
,
and
*NL*
in
a
stooping
,
not
yet
erect
posture
,
looked
up
at
him
from
under
his
*NL*
brows
.
He
did
not
understand
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
feeling
,
but
he
*NL*
felt
that
it
was
something
higher
and
even
unattainable
for
him
with
his
*NL*
view
of
life
.

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
conversation
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
Vronsky
went
out
onto
*NL*
the
steps
of
the
Karenins
'
house
and
stood
still
,
with
difficulty
*NL*
remembering
where
he
was
,
and
where
he
ought
to
walk
or
drive
.
He
felt
*NL*
disgraced
,
humiliated
,
guilty
,
and
deprived
of
all
possibility
of
*NL*
washing
away
his
humiliation
.
He
felt
thrust
out
of
the
beaten
track
*NL*
along
which
he
had
so
proudly
and
lightly
walked
till
then
.
All
the
*NL*
habits
and
rules
of
his
life
that
had
seemed
so
firm
,
had
turned
out
*NL*
suddenly
false
and
inapplicable
.
The
betrayed
husband
,
who
had
figured
*NL*
till
that
time
as
a
pitiful
creature
,
an
incidental
and
somewhat
*NL*
ludicrous
obstacle
to
his
happiness
,
had
suddenly
been
summoned
by
her
*NL*
herself
,
elevated
to
an
awe-inspiring
pinnacle
,
and
on
the
pinnacle
that
*NL*
husband
had
shown
himself
,
not
malignant
,
not
false
,
not
ludicrous
,
but
*NL*
kind
and
straightforward
and
large
.
Vronsky
could
not
but
feel
this
,
and
*NL*
the
parts
were
suddenly
reversed
.
Vronsky
felt
his
elevation
and
his
own
*NL*
abasement
,
his
truth
and
his
own
falsehood
.
He
felt
that
the
husband
was
*NL*
magnanimous
even
in
his
sorrow
,
while
he
had
been
base
and
petty
in
his
*NL*
deceit
.
But
this
sense
of
his
own
humiliation
before
the
man
he
had
*NL*
unjustly
despised
made
up
only
a
small
part
of
his
misery
.
He
felt
*NL*
unutterably
wretched
now
,
for
his
passion
for
Anna
,
which
had
seemed
to
*NL*
him
of
late
to
be
growing
cooler
,
now
that
he
knew
he
had
lost
her
*NL*
forever
,
was
stronger
than
ever
it
had
been
.
He
had
seen
all
of
her
in
*NL*
her
illness
,
had
come
to
know
her
very
soul
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
he
had
never
loved
her
till
then
.
And
now
when
he
had
learned
to
know
*NL*
her
,
to
love
her
as
she
should
be
loved
,
he
had
been
humiliated
before
*NL*
her
,
and
had
lost
her
forever
,
leaving
with
her
nothing
of
himself
but
a
*NL*
shameful
memory
.
Most
terrible
of
all
had
been
his
ludicrous
,
shameful
*NL*
position
when
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
pulled
his
hands
away
from
his
*NL*
humiliated
face
.
He
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
Karenins
'
house
like
one
*NL*
distraught
,
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sledge
,
sir
?
''
asked
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
sledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
getting
home
,
after
three
sleepless
nights
,
Vronsky
,
without
*NL*
undressing
,
lay
down
flat
on
the
sofa
,
clasping
his
hands
and
laying
his
*NL*
head
on
them
.
His
head
was
heavy
.
Images
,
memories
,
and
ideas
of
the
*NL*
strangest
description
followed
one
another
with
extraordinary
rapidity
*NL*
and
vividness
.
First
it
was
the
medicine
he
had
poured
out
for
the
*NL*
patient
and
spilt
over
the
spoon
,
then
the
midwife
's
white
hands
,
then
*NL*
the
queer
posture
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
on
the
floor
beside
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sleep
!
To
forget
!
''
he
said
to
himself
with
the
serene
confidence
of
*NL*
a
healthy
man
that
if
he
is
tired
and
sleepy
,
he
will
go
to
sleep
at
*NL*
once
.
And
the
same
instant
his
head
did
begin
to
feel
drowsy
and
he
*NL*
began
to
drop
off
into
forgetfulness
.
The
waves
of
the
sea
of
*NL*
unconsciousness
had
begun
to
meet
over
his
head
,
when
all
at
once
--
it
*NL*
was
as
though
a
violent
shock
of
electricity
had
passed
over
him
.
He
*NL*
started
so
that
he
leaped
up
on
the
springs
of
the
sofa
,
and
leaning
on
*NL*
his
arms
got
in
a
panic
onto
his
knees
.
His
eyes
were
wide
open
as
*NL*
though
he
had
never
been
asleep
.
The
heaviness
in
his
head
and
the
*NL*
weariness
in
his
limbs
that
he
had
felt
a
minute
before
had
suddenly
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
trample
me
in
the
mud
,
''
he
heard
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
words
*NL*
and
saw
him
standing
before
him
,
and
saw
Anna
's
face
with
its
burning
*NL*
flush
and
glittering
eyes
,
gazing
with
love
and
tenderness
not
at
him
*NL*
but
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
he
saw
his
own
,
as
he
fancied
,
foolish
and
*NL*
ludicrous
figure
when
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
his
hands
away
from
his
*NL*
face
.
He
stretched
out
his
legs
again
and
flung
himself
on
the
sofa
in
*NL*
the
same
position
and
shut
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sleep
!
To
forget
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
But
with
his
eyes
shut
he
*NL*
saw
more
distinctly
than
ever
Anna
's
face
as
it
had
been
on
the
*NL*
memorable
evening
before
the
races
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
and
will
not
be
,
and
she
wants
to
wipe
it
out
of
her
*NL*
memory
.
But
I
can
not
live
without
it
.
How
can
we
be
reconciled
?
how
can
*NL*
we
be
reconciled
?
''
he
said
aloud
,
and
unconsciously
began
to
repeat
*NL*
these
words
.
This
repetition
checked
the
rising
up
of
fresh
images
and
*NL*
memories
,
which
he
felt
were
thronging
in
his
brain
.
But
repeating
words
*NL*
did
not
check
his
imagination
for
long
.
Again
in
extraordinarily
rapid
*NL*
succession
his
best
moments
rose
before
his
mind
,
and
then
his
recent
*NL*
humiliation
.
``
Take
away
his
hands
,
''
Anna
's
voice
says
.
He
takes
away
his
*NL*
hands
and
feels
the
shamestruck
and
idiotic
expression
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
lay
down
,
trying
to
sleep
,
though
he
felt
there
was
not
the
*NL*
smallest
hope
of
it
,
and
kept
repeating
stray
words
from
some
chain
of
*NL*
thought
,
trying
by
this
to
check
the
rising
flood
of
fresh
images
.
He
*NL*
listened
,
and
heard
in
a
strange
,
mad
whisper
words
repeated
:
``
I
did
not
*NL*
appreciate
it
,
did
not
make
enough
of
it
.
I
did
not
appreciate
it
,
did
*NL*
not
make
enough
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
Am
I
going
out
of
my
mind
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Perhaps
.
*NL*
What
makes
men
go
out
of
their
minds
;
what
makes
men
shoot
themselves
?
''
*NL*
he
answered
himself
,
and
opening
his
eyes
,
he
saw
with
wonder
an
*NL*
embroidered
cushion
beside
him
,
worked
by
Varya
,
his
brother
's
wife
.
He
*NL*
touched
the
tassel
of
the
cushion
,
and
tried
to
think
of
Varya
,
of
when
*NL*
he
had
seen
her
last
.
But
to
think
of
anything
extraneous
was
an
*NL*
agonizing
effort
.
``
No
,
I
must
sleep
!
''
He
moved
the
cushion
up
,
and
*NL*
pressed
his
head
into
it
,
but
he
had
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
his
eyes
*NL*
shut
.
He
jumped
up
and
sat
down
.
``
That
's
all
over
for
me
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
I
must
think
what
to
do
.
What
is
left
?
''
His
mind
rapidly
ran
*NL*
through
his
life
apart
from
his
love
of
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ambition
?
Serpuhovskoy
?
Society
?
The
court
?
''
He
could
not
come
to
a
*NL*
pause
anywhere
.
All
of
it
had
had
meaning
before
,
but
now
there
was
no
*NL*
reality
in
it
.
He
got
up
from
the
sofa
,
took
off
his
coat
,
undid
his
*NL*
belt
,
and
uncovering
his
hairy
chest
to
breathe
more
freely
,
walked
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
.
``
This
is
how
people
go
mad
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
and
how
*NL*
they
shoot
themselves
...
to
escape
humiliation
,
''
he
added
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
door
and
closed
it
,
then
with
fixed
eyes
and
clenched
*NL*
teeth
he
went
up
to
the
table
,
took
a
revolver
,
looked
round
him
,
turned
*NL*
it
to
a
loaded
barrel
,
and
sank
into
thought
.
For
two
minutes
,
his
head
*NL*
bent
forward
with
an
expression
of
an
intense
effort
of
thought
,
he
*NL*
stood
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand
,
motionless
,
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
as
though
a
logical
,
continuous
,
and
*NL*
clear
chain
of
reasoning
had
brought
him
to
an
indubitable
conclusion
.
*NL*
In
reality
this
``
of
course
,
''
that
seemed
convincing
to
him
,
was
simply
*NL*
the
result
of
exactly
the
same
circle
of
memories
and
images
through
*NL*
which
he
had
passed
ten
times
already
during
the
last
hour
--
memories
of
*NL*
happiness
lost
forever
.
There
was
the
same
conception
of
the
*NL*
senselessness
of
everything
to
come
in
life
,
the
same
consciousness
of
*NL*
humiliation
.
Even
the
sequence
of
these
images
and
emotions
was
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
repeated
,
when
for
the
third
time
his
thought
passed
*NL*
again
round
the
same
spellbound
circle
of
memories
and
images
,
and
*NL*
pulling
the
revolver
to
the
left
side
of
his
chest
,
and
clutching
it
*NL*
vigorously
with
his
whole
hand
,
as
it
were
,
squeezing
it
in
his
fist
,
he
*NL*
pulled
the
trigger
.
He
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
the
shot
,
but
a
violent
*NL*
blow
on
his
chest
sent
him
reeling
.
He
tried
to
clutch
at
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
table
,
dropped
the
revolver
,
staggered
,
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
,
*NL*
looking
about
him
in
astonishment
.
He
did
not
recognize
his
room
,
*NL*
looking
up
from
the
ground
,
at
the
bent
legs
of
the
table
,
at
the
*NL*
wastepaper
basket
,
and
the
tiger-skin
rug
.
The
hurried
,
creaking
steps
*NL*
of
his
servant
coming
through
the
drawing
room
brought
him
to
his
*NL*
senses
.
He
made
an
effort
at
thought
,
and
was
aware
that
he
was
on
the
*NL*
floor
;
and
seeing
blood
on
the
tiger-skin
rug
and
on
his
arm
,
he
knew
he
*NL*
had
shot
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Idiotic
!
Missed
!
''
he
said
,
fumbling
after
the
revolver
.
The
revolver
*NL*
was
close
beside
him
--
he
sought
further
off
.
Still
feeling
for
it
,
he
*NL*
stretched
out
to
the
other
side
,
and
not
being
strong
enough
to
keep
his
*NL*
balance
,
fell
over
,
streaming
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elegant
,
whiskered
manservant
,
who
used
to
be
continually
*NL*
complaining
to
his
acquaintances
of
the
delicacy
of
his
nerves
,
was
so
*NL*
panic-stricken
on
seeing
his
master
lying
on
the
floor
,
that
he
left
him
*NL*
losing
blood
while
he
ran
for
assistance
.
An
hour
later
Varya
,
his
*NL*
brother
's
wife
,
had
arrived
,
and
with
the
assistance
of
three
doctors
,
*NL*
whom
she
had
sent
for
in
all
directions
,
and
who
all
appeared
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
,
she
got
the
wounded
man
to
bed
,
and
remained
to
nurse
him
.

The
mistake
made
by
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
in
that
,
when
preparing
for
*NL*
seeing
his
wife
,
he
had
overlooked
the
possibility
that
her
repentance
*NL*
might
be
sincere
,
and
he
might
forgive
her
,
and
she
might
not
die
--
this
*NL*
mistake
was
two
months
after
his
return
from
Moscow
brought
home
to
him
*NL*
in
all
its
significance
.
But
the
mistake
made
by
him
had
arisen
not
*NL*
simply
from
his
having
overlooked
that
contingency
,
but
also
from
the
*NL*
fact
that
until
that
day
of
his
interview
with
his
dying
wife
,
he
had
*NL*
not
known
his
own
heart
.
At
his
sick
wife
's
bedside
he
had
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
his
life
given
way
to
that
feeling
of
sympathetic
suffering
*NL*
always
roused
in
him
by
the
sufferings
of
others
,
and
hitherto
looked
on
*NL*
by
him
with
shame
as
a
harmful
weakness
.
And
pity
for
her
,
and
remorse
*NL*
for
having
desired
her
death
,
and
most
of
all
,
the
joy
of
forgiveness
,
*NL*
made
him
at
once
conscious
,
not
simply
of
the
relief
of
his
own
*NL*
sufferings
,
but
of
a
spiritual
peace
he
had
never
experienced
before
.
He
*NL*
suddenly
felt
that
the
very
thing
that
was
the
source
of
his
sufferings
*NL*
had
become
the
source
of
his
spiritual
joy
;
that
what
had
seemed
*NL*
insoluble
while
he
was
judging
,
blaming
,
and
hating
,
had
become
clear
*NL*
and
simple
when
he
forgave
and
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
forgave
his
wife
and
pitied
her
for
her
sufferings
and
her
remorse
.
*NL*
He
forgave
Vronsky
,
and
pitied
him
,
especially
after
reports
reached
him
*NL*
of
his
despairing
action
.
He
felt
more
for
his
son
than
before
.
And
he
*NL*
blamed
himself
now
for
having
taken
too
little
interest
in
him
.
But
for
*NL*
the
little
newborn
baby
he
felt
a
quite
peculiar
sentiment
,
not
of
pity
,
*NL*
only
,
but
of
tenderness
.
At
first
,
from
a
feeling
of
compassion
alone
,
*NL*
he
had
been
interested
in
the
delicate
little
creature
,
who
was
not
his
*NL*
child
,
and
who
was
cast
on
one
side
during
her
mother
's
illness
,
and
*NL*
would
certainly
have
died
if
he
had
not
troubled
about
her
,
and
he
did
*NL*
not
himself
observe
how
fond
he
became
of
her
.
He
would
go
into
the
*NL*
nursery
several
times
a
day
,
and
sit
there
for
a
long
while
,
so
that
the
*NL*
nurses
,
who
were
at
first
afraid
of
him
,
got
quite
used
to
his
presence
.
*NL*
Sometimes
for
half
an
hour
at
a
stretch
he
would
sit
silently
gazing
at
*NL*
the
saffron-red
,
downy
,
wrinkled
face
of
the
sleeping
baby
,
watching
the
*NL*
movements
of
the
frowning
brows
,
and
the
fat
little
hands
,
with
clenched
*NL*
fingers
,
that
rubbed
the
little
eyes
and
nose
.
At
such
moments
*NL*
particularly
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
a
sense
of
perfect
peace
and
*NL*
inward
harmony
,
and
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
position
,
nothing
*NL*
that
ought
to
be
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
time
went
on
,
he
saw
more
and
more
distinctly
that
however
*NL*
natural
the
position
now
seemed
to
him
,
he
would
not
long
be
allowed
to
*NL*
remain
in
it
.
He
felt
that
besides
the
blessed
spiritual
force
*NL*
controlling
his
soul
,
there
was
another
,
a
brutal
force
,
as
powerful
,
or
*NL*
more
powerful
,
which
controlled
his
life
,
and
that
this
force
would
not
*NL*
allow
him
that
humble
peace
he
longed
for
.
He
felt
that
everyone
was
*NL*
looking
at
him
with
inquiring
wonder
,
that
he
was
not
understood
,
and
*NL*
that
something
was
expected
of
him
.
Above
all
,
he
felt
the
instability
*NL*
and
unnaturalness
of
his
relations
with
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
softening
effect
of
the
near
approach
of
death
had
passed
away
,
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
began
to
notice
that
Anna
was
afraid
of
him
,
ill
*NL*
at
ease
with
him
,
and
could
not
look
him
straight
in
the
face
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
be
wanting
,
and
not
daring
,
to
tell
him
something
;
and
as
*NL*
though
foreseeing
their
present
relations
could
not
continue
,
she
seemed
*NL*
to
be
expecting
something
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
February
it
happened
that
Anna
's
baby
daughter
,
who
*NL*
had
been
named
Anna
too
,
fell
ill
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
in
the
*NL*
nursery
in
the
morning
,
and
leaving
orders
for
the
doctor
to
be
sent
*NL*
for
,
he
went
to
his
office
.
On
finishing
his
work
,
he
returned
home
at
*NL*
four
.
Going
into
the
hall
he
saw
a
handsome
groom
,
in
a
braided
livery
*NL*
and
a
bear
fur
cape
,
holding
a
white
fur
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
here
?
''
asked
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
Elizaveta
Federovna
Tverskaya
,
''
the
groom
answered
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
that
he
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
difficult
time
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
noticed
that
*NL*
his
worldly
acquaintances
,
especially
women
,
took
a
peculiar
interest
in
*NL*
him
and
his
wife
.
All
these
acquaintances
he
observed
with
difficulty
*NL*
concealing
their
mirth
at
something
;
the
same
mirth
that
he
had
*NL*
perceived
in
the
lawyer
's
eyes
,
and
just
now
in
the
eyes
of
this
groom
.
*NL*
Everyone
seemed
,
somehow
,
hugely
delighted
,
as
though
they
had
just
been
*NL*
at
a
wedding
.
When
they
met
him
,
with
ill-disguised
enjoyment
they
*NL*
inquired
after
his
wife
's
health
.
The
presence
of
Princess
Tverskaya
was
*NL*
unpleasant
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
from
the
memories
associated
with
*NL*
her
,
and
also
because
he
disliked
her
,
and
he
went
straight
to
the
*NL*
nursery
.
In
the
day
nursery
Seryozha
,
leaning
on
the
table
with
his
legs
*NL*
on
a
chair
,
was
drawing
and
chatting
away
merrily
.
The
English
*NL*
governess
,
who
had
during
Anna
's
illness
replaced
the
French
one
,
was
*NL*
sitting
near
the
boy
knitting
a
shawl
.
She
hurriedly
got
up
,
curtseyed
,
*NL*
and
pulled
Seryozha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stroked
his
son
's
hair
,
answered
the
governess
's
*NL*
inquiries
about
his
wife
,
and
asked
what
the
doctor
had
said
of
the
*NL*
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
said
it
was
nothing
serious
,
and
he
ordered
a
bath
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
still
in
pain
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
listening
to
the
*NL*
baby
's
screaming
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
the
wet-nurse
,
sir
,
''
the
Englishwoman
said
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
so
?
''
he
asked
,
stopping
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
as
it
was
at
Countess
Paul
's
,
sir
.
They
gave
the
baby
*NL*
medicine
,
and
it
turned
out
that
the
baby
was
simply
hungry
:
the
nurse
*NL*
had
no
milk
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
pondered
,
and
after
standing
still
a
few
seconds
*NL*
he
went
in
at
the
other
door
.
The
baby
was
lying
with
its
head
thrown
*NL*
back
,
stiffening
itself
in
the
nurse
's
arms
,
and
would
not
take
the
*NL*
plump
breast
offered
it
;
and
it
never
ceased
screaming
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
double
hushing
of
the
wet-nurse
and
the
other
nurse
,
who
was
bending
*NL*
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
no
better
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
very
restless
,
''
answered
the
nurse
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Edwarde
says
that
perhaps
the
wet-nurse
has
no
milk
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
n't
you
say
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
one
to
say
it
to
?
Anna
Arkadyevna
still
ill
...
''
said
the
nurse
*NL*
discontentedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
was
an
old
servant
of
the
family
.
And
in
her
simple
words
*NL*
there
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
an
allusion
to
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baby
screamed
louder
than
ever
,
struggling
and
sobbing
.
The
nurse
,
*NL*
with
a
gesture
of
despair
,
went
to
it
,
took
it
from
the
wet-nurse
's
*NL*
arms
,
and
began
walking
up
and
down
,
rocking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
ask
the
doctor
to
examine
the
wet-nurse
,
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
The
smartly
dressed
and
healthy-looking
nurse
,
*NL*
frightened
at
the
idea
of
losing
her
place
,
muttered
something
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
covering
her
bosom
,
smiled
contemptuously
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
doubts
being
cast
on
her
abundance
of
milk
.
In
that
smile
,
too
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
saw
a
sneer
at
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckless
child
!
''
said
the
nurse
,
hushing
the
baby
,
and
still
walking
up
*NL*
and
down
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sat
down
,
and
with
a
despondent
and
suffering
face
*NL*
watched
the
nurse
walking
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
child
at
last
was
still
,
and
had
been
put
in
a
deep
bed
,
and
*NL*
the
nurse
,
after
smoothing
the
little
pillow
,
had
left
her
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
got
up
,
and
walking
awkwardly
on
tiptoe
,
approached
the
*NL*
baby
.
For
a
minute
he
was
still
,
and
with
the
same
despondent
face
gazed
*NL*
at
the
baby
;
but
all
at
once
a
smile
,
that
moved
his
hair
and
the
skin
*NL*
of
his
forehead
,
came
out
on
his
face
,
and
he
went
as
softly
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dining
room
he
rang
the
bell
,
and
told
the
servant
who
came
in
to
*NL*
send
again
for
the
doctor
.
He
felt
vexed
with
his
wife
for
not
being
*NL*
anxious
about
this
exquisite
baby
,
and
in
this
vexed
humor
he
had
no
*NL*
wish
to
go
to
her
;
he
had
no
wish
,
either
,
to
see
Princess
Betsy
.
But
*NL*
his
wife
might
wonder
why
he
did
not
go
to
her
as
usual
;
and
so
,
*NL*
overcoming
his
disinclination
,
he
went
towards
the
bedroom
.
As
he
walked
*NL*
over
the
soft
rug
towards
the
door
,
he
could
not
help
overhearing
a
*NL*
conversation
he
did
not
want
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
had
n't
been
going
away
,
I
could
have
understood
your
answer
and
*NL*
his
too
.
But
your
husband
ought
to
be
above
that
,
''
Betsy
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
for
my
husband
;
for
myself
I
do
n't
wish
it
.
Do
n't
say
that
!
''
*NL*
answered
Anna
's
excited
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
must
care
to
say
good-bye
to
a
man
who
has
shot
himself
on
*NL*
your
account
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
why
I
do
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
dismayed
and
guilty
expression
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stopped
and
*NL*
would
have
gone
back
unobserved
.
But
reflecting
that
this
would
be
*NL*
undignified
,
he
turned
back
again
,
and
clearing
his
throat
,
he
went
up
*NL*
to
the
bedroom
.
The
voices
were
silent
,
and
he
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
in
a
gray
dressing
gown
,
with
a
crop
of
short
clustering
black
*NL*
curls
on
her
round
head
,
was
sitting
on
a
settee
.
The
eagerness
died
out
*NL*
of
her
face
,
as
it
always
did
,
at
the
sight
of
her
husband
;
she
dropped
*NL*
her
head
and
looked
round
uneasily
at
Betsy
.
Betsy
,
dressed
in
the
*NL*
height
of
the
latest
fashion
,
in
a
hat
that
towered
somewhere
over
her
*NL*
head
like
a
shade
on
a
lamp
,
in
a
blue
dress
with
violet
crossway
*NL*
stripes
slanting
one
way
on
the
bodice
and
the
other
way
on
the
skirt
,
*NL*
was
sitting
beside
Anna
,
her
tall
flat
figure
held
erect
.
Bowing
her
*NL*
head
,
she
greeted
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
with
an
ironical
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
said
,
as
though
surprised
.
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
're
at
home
.
You
*NL*
never
put
in
an
appearance
anywhere
,
and
I
have
n't
seen
you
ever
since
*NL*
Anna
has
been
ill
.
I
have
heard
all
about
it
--
your
anxiety
.
Yes
,
you
're
*NL*
a
wonderful
husband
!
''
she
said
,
with
a
meaning
and
affable
air
,
as
*NL*
though
she
were
bestowing
an
order
of
magnanimity
on
him
for
his
conduct
*NL*
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
bowed
frigidly
,
and
kissing
his
wife
's
hand
,
asked
*NL*
how
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
,
I
think
,
''
she
said
,
avoiding
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
rather
a
feverish-looking
color
,
''
he
said
,
laying
stress
on
*NL*
the
word
``
feverish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
been
talking
too
much
,
''
said
Betsy
.
``
I
feel
it
's
selfishness
on
*NL*
my
part
,
and
I
am
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
up
,
but
Anna
,
suddenly
flushing
,
quickly
caught
at
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
a
minute
,
please
.
I
must
tell
you
...
no
,
you
.
''
she
turned
to
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
her
neck
and
brow
were
suffused
with
crimson
.
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
and
ca
n't
keep
anything
secret
from
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
cracked
his
fingers
and
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Betsy
's
been
telling
me
that
Count
Vronsky
wants
to
come
here
to
say
*NL*
good-bye
before
his
departure
for
Tashkend
.
''
She
did
not
look
at
her
*NL*
husband
,
and
was
evidently
in
haste
to
have
everything
out
,
however
hard
*NL*
it
might
be
for
her
.
``
I
told
her
I
could
not
receive
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
my
dear
,
that
it
would
depend
on
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
''
*NL*
Betsy
corrected
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
ca
n't
receive
him
;
and
what
object
would
there
...
''
She
*NL*
stopped
suddenly
,
and
glanced
inquiringly
at
her
husband
-LRB-
he
did
not
*NL*
look
at
her
-RRB-
.
``
In
short
,
I
do
n't
wish
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
advanced
and
would
have
taken
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
impulse
was
to
jerk
back
her
hand
from
the
damp
hand
with
big
*NL*
swollen
veins
that
sought
hers
,
but
with
an
obvious
effort
to
control
*NL*
herself
she
pressed
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
confidence
,
but
...
''
he
said
,
feeling
*NL*
with
confusion
and
annoyance
that
what
he
could
decide
easily
and
*NL*
clearly
by
himself
,
he
could
not
discuss
before
Princess
Tverskaya
,
who
*NL*
to
him
stood
for
the
incarnation
of
that
brute
force
which
would
*NL*
inevitably
control
him
in
the
life
he
led
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
and
*NL*
hinder
him
from
giving
way
to
his
feeling
of
love
and
forgiveness
.
He
*NL*
stopped
short
,
looking
at
Princess
Tverskaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-bye
,
my
darling
,
''
said
Betsy
,
getting
up
.
She
kissed
Anna
,
*NL*
and
went
out
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
escorted
her
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
I
know
you
are
a
truly
magnanimous
man
,
''
said
*NL*
Betsy
,
stopping
in
the
little
drawing-room
,
and
with
special
warmth
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
him
once
more
.
``
I
am
an
outsider
,
but
I
so
love
her
*NL*
and
respect
you
that
I
venture
to
advise
.
Receive
him
.
Alexey
Vronsky
is
*NL*
the
soul
of
honor
,
and
he
is
going
away
to
Tashkend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
princess
,
for
your
sympathy
and
advice
.
But
the
question
of
*NL*
whether
my
wife
can
or
can
not
see
anyone
she
must
decide
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
from
habit
,
lifting
his
brows
with
dignity
,
and
reflected
*NL*
immediately
that
whatever
his
words
might
be
,
there
could
be
no
dignity
*NL*
in
his
position
.
And
he
saw
this
by
the
suppressed
,
malicious
,
and
*NL*
ironical
smile
with
which
Betsy
glanced
at
him
after
this
phrase
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
leave
of
Betsy
in
the
drawing
room
,
and
went
*NL*
to
his
wife
.
She
was
lying
down
,
but
hearing
his
steps
she
sat
up
*NL*
hastily
in
her
former
attitude
,
and
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
him
.
He
*NL*
saw
she
had
been
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
grateful
for
your
confidence
in
me
.
''
He
repeated
gently
in
*NL*
Russian
the
phrase
he
had
said
in
Betsy
's
presence
in
French
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
beside
her
.
When
he
spoke
to
her
in
Russian
,
using
the
Russian
*NL*
``
thou
''
of
intimacy
and
affection
,
it
was
insufferably
irritating
to
*NL*
Anna
.
``
And
I
am
very
grateful
for
your
decision
.
I
,
too
,
imagine
that
*NL*
since
he
is
going
away
,
there
is
no
sort
of
necessity
for
Count
Vronsky
*NL*
to
come
here
.
However
,
if
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
've
said
so
already
,
so
why
repeat
it
?
''
Anna
suddenly
interrupted
*NL*
him
with
an
irritation
she
could
not
succeed
in
repressing
.
``
No
sort
of
*NL*
necessity
,
''
she
thought
,
``
for
a
man
to
come
and
say
good-bye
to
the
*NL*
woman
he
loves
,
for
whom
he
was
ready
to
ruin
himself
,
and
has
ruined
*NL*
himself
,
and
who
can
not
live
without
him
.
No
sort
of
necessity
!
''
she
*NL*
compressed
her
lips
,
and
dropped
her
burning
eyes
to
his
hands
with
*NL*
their
swollen
veins
.
They
were
rubbing
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
never
speak
of
it
,
''
she
added
more
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
left
this
question
to
you
to
decide
,
and
I
am
very
glad
to
*NL*
see
...
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
my
wish
coincides
with
your
own
,
''
she
finished
quickly
,
*NL*
exasperated
at
his
talking
so
slowly
while
she
knew
beforehand
all
he
*NL*
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
assented
;
``
and
Princess
Tverskaya
's
interference
in
the
most
*NL*
difficult
private
affairs
is
utterly
uncalled
for

She
especially
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
what
's
said
about
her
,

said
Anna
quickly
.
``
I
*NL*
know
she
really
cares
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sighed
and
said
nothing
.
She
played
nervously
with
*NL*
the
tassel
of
her
dressing-gown
,
glancing
at
him
with
that
torturing
*NL*
sensation
of
physical
repulsion
for
which
she
blamed
herself
,
though
she
*NL*
could
not
control
it
.
Her
only
desire
now
was
to
be
rid
of
his
*NL*
oppressive
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
sent
for
the
doctor
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
well
;
what
do
I
want
the
doctor
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
little
one
cries
,
and
they
say
the
nurse
has
n't
enough
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
let
me
nurse
her
,
when
I
begged
to
?
Anyway
''
-LRB-
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
knew
what
was
meant
by
that
``
anyway
''
-RRB-
,
``
she
's
a
baby
,
and
*NL*
they
're
killing
her
.
''
She
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
the
baby
to
be
*NL*
brought
her
.
``
I
begged
to
nurse
her
,
I
was
n't
allowed
to
,
and
now
I
'm
*NL*
blamed
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
blame

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
blame
me
!
My
God

why
did
n't
I
die

''
And
she
broke
into
*NL*
sobs
.
``
Forgive
me
,
I
'm
nervous
,
I
'm
unjust
,
''
she
said
,
controlling
*NL*
herself
,
``
but
do
go
away
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
,
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
said
to
himself
*NL*
decidedly
as
he
left
his
wife
's
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
the
impossibility
of
his
position
in
the
world
's
eyes
,
and
his
*NL*
wife
's
hatred
of
him
,
and
altogether
the
might
of
that
mysterious
brutal
*NL*
force
that
guided
his
life
against
his
spiritual
inclinations
,
and
*NL*
exacted
conformity
with
its
decrees
and
change
in
his
attitude
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
been
presented
to
him
with
such
distinctness
as
that
day
.
He
saw
*NL*
clearly
that
all
the
world
and
his
wife
expected
of
him
something
,
but
*NL*
what
exactly
,
he
could
not
make
out
.
He
felt
that
this
was
rousing
in
*NL*
his
soul
a
feeling
of
anger
destructive
of
his
peace
of
mind
and
of
all
*NL*
the
good
of
his
achievement
.
He
believed
that
for
Anna
herself
it
would
*NL*
be
better
to
break
off
all
relations
with
Vronsky
;
but
if
they
all
*NL*
thought
this
out
of
the
question
,
he
was
even
ready
to
allow
these
*NL*
relations
to
be
renewed
,
so
long
as
the
children
were
not
disgraced
,
and
*NL*
he
was
not
deprived
of
them
nor
forced
to
change
his
position
.
Bad
as
*NL*
this
might
be
,
it
was
anyway
better
than
a
rupture
,
which
would
put
her
*NL*
in
a
hopeless
and
shameful
position
,
and
deprive
him
of
everything
he
*NL*
cared
for
.
But
he
felt
helpless
;
he
knew
beforehand
that
every
one
was
*NL*
against
him
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
do
what
seemed
to
him
*NL*
now
so
natural
and
right
,
but
would
be
forced
to
do
what
was
wrong
,
*NL*
though
it
seemed
the
proper
thing
to
them
.

*NL*
Before
Betsy
had
time
to
walk
out
of
the
drawing-room
,
she
was
met
in
*NL*
the
doorway
by
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
had
just
come
from
Yeliseev
's
,
*NL*
where
a
consignment
of
fresh
oysters
had
been
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
princess
!
what
a
delightful
meeting
!
''
he
began
.
``
I
've
been
to
see
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
meeting
for
one
minute
,
for
I
'm
going
,
''
said
Betsy
,
smiling
and
*NL*
putting
on
her
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
put
on
your
glove
yet
,
princess
;
let
me
kiss
your
hand
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
I
'm
so
thankful
to
the
revival
of
the
old
fashions
for
as
the
*NL*
kissing
the
hand
.
''
He
kissed
Betsy
's
hand
.
``
When
shall
we
see
each
*NL*
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
deserve
it
,
''
answered
Betsy
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
deserve
a
great
deal
,
for
I
've
become
a
most
serious
person
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
only
manage
my
own
affairs
,
but
other
people
's
too
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
a
significant
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
!
''
answered
Betsy
,
at
once
understanding
that
he
was
*NL*
speaking
of
Anna
.
And
going
back
into
the
drawing
room
,
they
stood
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
``
He
's
killing
her
,
''
said
Betsy
in
a
whisper
full
of
meaning
.
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
,
impossible
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
you
think
so
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
shaking
his
head
*NL*
with
a
serious
and
sympathetically
distressed
expression
,
``
that
's
what
*NL*
I
've
come
to
Petersburg
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
town
's
talking
of
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
an
impossible
*NL*
position
.
She
pines
and
pines
away
.
He
does
n't
understand
that
she
's
one
*NL*
of
those
women
who
ca
n't
trifle
with
their
feelings
.
One
of
two
things
:
*NL*
either
let
him
take
her
away
,
act
with
energy
,
or
give
her
a
divorce
.
*NL*
This
is
stifling
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
...
just
so
...
''
Oblonsky
said
,
sighing
.
``
That
's
what
I
've
come
*NL*
for
.
At
least
not
solely
for
that
...
I
've
been
made
a
_
Kammerherr
_
;
of
*NL*
course
,
one
has
to
say
thank
you
.
But
the
chief
thing
was
having
to
*NL*
settle
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
God
help
you
!
''
said
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
accompanying
Betsy
to
the
outside
hall
,
once
more
kissing
her
hand
*NL*
above
the
glove
,
at
the
point
where
the
pulse
beats
,
and
murmuring
to
*NL*
her
such
unseemly
nonsense
that
she
did
not
know
whether
to
laugh
or
be
*NL*
angry
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
to
his
sister
.
He
found
her
in
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
happened
to
be
bubbling
over
with
good
spirits
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
immediately
and
quite
naturally
fell
into
the
sympathetic
,
*NL*
poetically
emotional
tone
which
harmonized
with
her
mood
.
He
asked
her
*NL*
how
she
was
,
and
how
she
had
spent
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
very
miserably
.
Today
and
this
morning
and
all
past
days
and
days
*NL*
to
come
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
giving
way
to
pessimism
.
You
must
rouse
yourself
,
you
*NL*
must
look
life
in
the
face
.
I
know
it
's
hard
,
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
it
said
that
women
love
men
even
for
their
vices
,
''
Anna
*NL*
began
suddenly
,
``
but
I
hate
him
for
his
virtues
.
I
ca
n't
live
with
him
.
*NL*
Do
you
understand
?
the
sight
of
him
has
a
physical
effect
on
me
,
it
*NL*
makes
me
beside
myself
.
I
ca
n't
,
I
ca
n't
live
with
him

What
am
I
to
do
?
*NL*
I
have
been
unhappy

and
used
to
think
one
could
n't
be
more
unhappy

but
*NL*
the
awful
state
of
things
I
am
going
through
now

I
could
never
have
*NL*
conceived

Would
you
believe
it

that
knowing
he
's
a
good
man
,
a
*NL*
splendid
man
,
that
I
'm
not
worth
his
little
finger
,
still
I
hate
him

I
*NL*
hate
him
for
his
generosity

And
there
's
nothing
left
for
me
but
...

*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
said
death
,
but
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
would
not
let
her
*NL*
finish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
ill
and
overwrought
,
''
he
said
;
``
believe
me
,
you
're
exaggerating
*NL*
dreadfully
.
There
's
nothing
so
terrible
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
smiled
.
No
one
else
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
*NL*
place
,
having
to
do
with
such
despair
,
would
have
ventured
to
smile
-LRB-
the
*NL*
smile
would
have
seemed
brutal
-RRB-
;
but
in
his
smile
there
was
so
much
of
*NL*
sweetness
and
almost
feminine
tenderness
that
his
smile
did
not
wound
,
*NL*
but
softened
and
soothed
.
His
gentle
,
soothing
words
and
smiles
were
as
*NL*
soothing
and
softening
as
almond
oil
.
And
Anna
soon
felt
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Stiva
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'm
lost
,
lost
!
worse
than
lost
!
I
ca
n't
say
yet
*NL*
that
all
is
over
;
on
the
contrary
,
I
feel
that
it
's
not
over
.
I
'm
an
*NL*
overstrained
string
that
must
snap
.
But
it
's
not
ended
yet
...
and
it
*NL*
will
have
a
fearful
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
,
we
must
let
the
string
be
loosened
,
little
by
little
.
*NL*
There
's
no
position
from
which
there
is
no
way
of
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
,
and
thought
.
Only
one
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
knew
from
her
terrified
eyes
that
this
one
way
of
escape
in
her
*NL*
thought
was
death
,
and
he
would
not
let
her
say
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
Listen
to
me

You
ca
n't
see
your
own
position
as
*NL*
I
can

Let
me
tell
you
candidly
my
opinion

''
Again
he
smiled
discreetly
*NL*
his
almond-oil
smile
.
``
I
'll
begin
from
the
beginning
.
You
married
a
man
*NL*
twenty
years
older
than
yourself
.
You
married
him
without
love
and
not
*NL*
knowing
what
love
was
.
It
was
a
mistake
,
let
's
admit

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fearful
mistake

said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
repeat
,
it
's
an
accomplished
fact

Then
you
had

say

He
stopped
at

waiting
for

she
*NL*
made
no

With
some
*NL*
effort
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
brought
out
his
central
idea
,
and
looked
*NL*
significantly
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing

shook

in
dissent

from
the
*NL*
look
in

that
suddenly
brightened
into
its
old
beauty
,
he
saw
*NL*
that
if

this

it
was
simply
because

her

unattainable

boldly

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
the
same
somewhat
solemn
expression
with
which
*NL*
he
used
to
take
his
presidential
chair
at
his
board
,
walked
into
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
room
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
walking
about
his
room
*NL*
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
,
thinking
of
just
what
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
had
been
discussing
with
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
interrupting
you
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
on
the
sight
of
*NL*
his
brother-in-law
becoming
suddenly
aware
of
a
sense
of
embarrassment
*NL*
unusual
with
him
.
To
conceal
this
embarrassment
he
took
out
a
cigarette
*NL*
case
he
had
just
bought
that
opened
in
a
new
way
,
and
sniffing
the
*NL*
leather
,
took
a
cigarette
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Do
you
want
anything
?
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
asked
without
*NL*
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wished
...
I
wanted
...
yes
,
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
surprise
aware
of
an
unaccustomed
timidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
feeling
was
so
unexpected
and
so
strange
that
he
did
not
believe
it
*NL*
was
the
voice
of
conscience
telling
him
that
what
he
was
meaning
to
do
*NL*
was
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
made
an
effort
and
struggled
with
the
timidity
that
*NL*
had
come
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
believe
in
my
love
for
my
sister

my
sincere
affection
*NL*
and
respect
for
you

he
said
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
stood
still
and
said
nothing
,
but
his
face
struck
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
by
its
expression
of
an
unresisting
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intended
...
I
wanted
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
about
my

your

''
he
said
,
still
struggling
with
an
*NL*
unaccustomed
constraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
smiled
mournfully
,
looked
at
his
brother-in-law
,
*NL*
and
without
answering
went
up
to
the
table
,
took
from
it
an
unfinished
*NL*
letter
,
and
handed
it
to
his
brother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
unceasingly
of

what

writing

I
could
say
it
better
by
letter

and
that
my
presence
*NL*
irritates
her

he
said
,
as
he
gave
him
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
the
letter
,
looked
with
incredulous
surprise
at
*NL*
the
lusterless
eyes
fixed
so
immovably
on
him
,
and
began
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
my

irksome

Painful
as
it
is
to
me
to

I
see
that
it
is
so

can
not
be
otherwise

I
do
n't
blame
*NL*
you
,
and
God
is
my
witness
that
on
seeing
you
at
the
time
of
your
*NL*
illness
I
resolved
with
my
whole
heart
to
forget
all
that
had
passed
*NL*
between
us
and
to
begin
a
new
life
.
I
do
not
regret
,
and
shall
never
*NL*
regret
,
what
I
have
done
;
but
I
have
desired
one
thing
--
your
good
,
the
*NL*
good
of
your
soul

now
I
see
I
have
not
attained
that

Tell
me

yourself
what
will
give
you
true
happiness

peace
to
your

I
put

myself
entirely
in

trust
to
your
feeling
of
what
's
*NL*
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
handed
back
the
letter
,
and
with
the
same
surprise
*NL*
continued
looking
at
his
brother-in-law
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
This
*NL*
silence
was
so
awkward
for
both
of
them
that
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
lips
*NL*
began
twitching
nervously
,
while
he
still
gazed
without
speaking
at
*NL*
Karenin
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
wanted
to

said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
not
able
to
answer
for
the
tears
*NL*
that
were
choking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

he
brought
out
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
what

said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
she
does
not
understand
her
own
position
.
She
is
not
a
*NL*
judge

''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
recovering
himself
.
``
She
is
crushed

*NL*
simply
crushed
by
your

If
she
were
to
read
this

would
be
incapable

saying
anything

hang
her

lower

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

directly
the
steps
you
consider
necessary
to
end
the
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
consider
it
must
be
ended

Alexey
Alexandrovitch
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
``
But
how

''
he
added
,
with
a
gesture
of
his
hands
before
his
eyes
*NL*
not
usual
with
him
.
``
I
see
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
way
of
getting
out
of

said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
standing
up
and
becoming
more
cheerful
.
``
There
was
a
time
*NL*
when

off

*NL*
*NL*
``
Happiness
may
be
variously
understood

But
suppose
that
I
agree

everything

that
I
want
nothing

what
way
is
there
of
getting
out

our

position

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

care

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
the
same
*NL*
smile
of
softening
,
almond-oil
tenderness
with
which
he
had
been
talking
*NL*
to
Anna
.
His
kindly
smile
was
so
winning
that
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
feeling
his
own
weakness
and
unconsciously
swayed
by
it
,
was
ready
to
*NL*
believe
what
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
never
speak
out
about
it

But
one
thing
is
possible

one
thing

''
he
went
on
,
``
that
is
the
cessation
of
your
relations
*NL*
and
all
memories
associated
with
them
.
To
my
thinking
,
in
your
position
*NL*
what
's
essential
is
the
formation
of
a
new
attitude
to
one
another
.
And
*NL*
that
can
only
rest
on
a
basis
of
freedom
on
both

*NL*
*NL*
``
Divorce

Alexey
Alexandrovitch
interrupted

in
a
tone
of
aversion

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
imagine
that
divorce

yes

divorce

Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
repeated
,
reddening
.
``
That
is
from
every
point

view
the
most
rational
*NL*
course
for
married
people

find
themselves
in

position
you
are

in

What
can
be
done
if

find

always
happen

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
sighed
heavily
and
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
only
one
point
to
be
considered
:
is
either
of
the
parties
*NL*
desirous
of
forming
new
ties
?
If
not
,
it
is
very
simple
,
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
feeling
more
and
more
free
from
constraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
scowling
with
emotion
,
muttered
something
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
made
no
answer
.
All
that
seemed
so
simple
to
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
thought
over
thousands
of
times
.
*NL*
And
,
so
far
from
being
simple
,
it
all
seemed
to
him
utterly
impossible
.
*NL*
Divorce
,
the
details
of
which
he
knew
by
this
time
,
seemed
to
him
now
*NL*
out
of
the
question
,
because
the
sense
of
his
own
dignity
and
respect
*NL*
for
religion
forbade
his
taking
upon
himself
a
fictitious
charge
of
*NL*
adultery
,
and
still
more
suffering
his
wife
,
pardoned
and
beloved
by
*NL*
him
,
to
be
caught
in
the
fact
and
put
to
public
shame
.
Divorce
appeared
*NL*
to
him
impossible
also
on
other
still
more
weighty
grounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
become
of
his
son
in
case
of
a
divorce
?
To
leave
him
with
his
*NL*
mother
was
out
of
the
question
.
The
divorced
mother
would
have
her
own
*NL*
illegitimate
family
,
in
which
his
position
as
a
stepson
and
his
*NL*
education
would
not
be
good
.
Keep
him
with
him
?
He
knew
that
would
be
an
*NL*
act
of
vengeance
on
his
part
,
and
that
he
did
not
want
.
But
apart
from
*NL*
this
,
what
more
than
all
made
divorce
seem
impossible
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
,
that
by
consenting
to
a
divorce
he
would
be
*NL*
completely
ruining
Anna
.
The
saying
of
Darya
Alexandrovna
at
Moscow
,
*NL*
that
in
deciding
on
a
divorce
he
was
thinking
of
himself
,
and
not
*NL*
considering
that
by
this
he
would
be
ruining
her
irrevocably
,
had
sunk
*NL*
into
his
heart
.
And
connecting
this
saying
with
his
forgiveness
of
her
,
*NL*
with
his
devotion
to
the
children
,
he
understood
it
now
in
his
own
way
.
*NL*
To
consent
to
a
divorce
,
to
give
her
her
freedom
,
meant
in
his
thoughts
*NL*
to
take
from
himself
the
last
tie
that
bound
him
to
life
--
the
children
*NL*
whom
he
loved
;
and
to
take
from
her
the
last
prop
that
stayed
her
on
the
*NL*
path
of
right
,
to
thrust
her
down
to
her
ruin
.
If
she
were
divorced
,
he
*NL*
knew
she
would
join
her
life
to
Vronsky
's
,
and
their
tie
would
be
an
*NL*
illegitimate
and
criminal
one
,
since
a
wife
,
by
the
interpretation
of
*NL*
the
ecclesiastical
law
,
could
not
marry
while
her
husband
was
living
.
*NL*
``
She
will
join
him
,
and
in
a
year
or
two
he
will
throw
her
over
,
or
she
*NL*
will
form
a
new
tie
,
''
thought
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
And
I
,
by
agreeing
*NL*
to
an
unlawful
divorce
,
shall
be
to
blame
for
her
ruin
.
''
He
had
thought
*NL*
it
all
over
hundreds
of
times
,
and
was
convinced
that
a
divorce
was
not
*NL*
at
all
simple
,
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
said
,
but
was
utterly
*NL*
impossible
.
He
did
not
believe
a
single
word
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
*NL*
him
;
to
every
word
he
had
a
thousand
objections
to
make
,
but
he
listened
*NL*
to
him
,
feeling
that
his
words
were
the
expression
of
that
mighty
brutal
*NL*
force
which
controlled
his
life
and
to
which
he
would
have
to
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
question
is
on
what
terms
you
agree
to
give
her
a
divorce
.
She
*NL*
does
not
want
anything
,
does
not
dare
ask
you
for
anything
,
she
leaves
*NL*
it
all
to
your
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
,
my
God
!
what
for
?
''
thought
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
remembering
*NL*
the
details
of
divorce
proceedings
in
which
the
husband
took
the
blame
*NL*
on
himself
,
and
with
just
the
same
gesture
with
which
Vronsky
had
done
*NL*
the
same
,
he
hid
his
face
for
shame
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
distressed
,
I
understand
that
.
But
if
you
think
it
over
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
,
turn
to
him
the
other
*NL*
also
;
and
if
any
man
take
away
thy
coat
,
let
him
have
thy
cloak
also
,
''
*NL*
thought
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
he
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
.
``
I
will
take
the
disgrace
on
*NL*
myself
,
I
will
give
up
even
my
son
,
but
...
but
would
n't
it
be
better
to
*NL*
let
it
alone
?
Still
you
may
do
as
you
like
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
away
so
that
his
brother-in-law
could
not
see
him
,
he
sat
*NL*
down
on
a
chair
at
the
window
.
There
was
bitterness
,
there
was
shame
in
*NL*
his
heart
,
but
with
bitterness
and
shame
he
felt
joy
and
emotion
at
the
*NL*
height
of
his
own
meekness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
touched
.
He
was
silent
for
a
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
believe
me
,
she
appreciates
your
generosity
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
But
it
seems
it
was
the
will
of
God
,
''
he
added
,
and
as
he
said
it
*NL*
felt
how
foolish
a
remark
it
was
,
and
with
difficulty
repressed
a
smile
*NL*
at
his
own
foolishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
would
have
made
some
reply
,
but
tears
stopped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
an
unhappy
fatality
,
and
one
must
accept
it
as
such
.
I
accept
*NL*
the
calamity
as
an
accomplished
fact
,
and
am
doing
my
best
to
help
both
*NL*
her
and
you
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
out
of
his
brother-in-law
's
room
he
was
touched
,
but
that
*NL*
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
glad
he
had
successfully
brought
the
*NL*
matter
to
a
conclusion
,
for
he
felt
certain
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
would
*NL*
not
go
back
on
his
words
.
To
this
satisfaction
was
added
the
fact
that
*NL*
an
idea
had
just
struck
him
for
a
riddle
turning
on
his
successful
*NL*
achievement
,
that
when
the
affair
was
over
he
would
ask
his
wife
and
*NL*
most
intimate
friends
.
He
put
this
riddle
into
two
or
three
different
*NL*
ways
.
``
But
I
'll
work
it
out
better
than
that
,
''
he
said
to
himself
with
a
*NL*
smile
.

*NL*
Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
wound
had
been
a
dangerous
one
,
though
it
did
not
touch
the
*NL*
heart
,
and
for
several
days
he
had
lain
between
life
and
death
.
The
*NL*
first
time
he
was
able
to
speak
,
Varya
,
his
brother
's
wife
,
was
alone
in
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varya
,
''
he
said
,
looking
sternly
at
her
,
``
I
shot
myself
by
accident
.
*NL*
And
please
never
speak
of
it
,
and
tell
everyone
so
.
Or
else
it
's
too
*NL*
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
answering
his
words
,
Varya
bent
over
him
,
and
with
a
delighted
*NL*
smile
gazed
into
his
face
.
His
eyes
were
clear
,
not
feverish
;
but
their
*NL*
expression
was
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
!
''
she
said
.
``
You
're
not
in
pain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
here
.
''
He
pointed
to
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
change
your
bandages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
,
stiffening
his
broad
jaws
,
he
looked
at
her
while
she
*NL*
bandaged
him
up
.
When
she
had
finished
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
delirious
.
Please
manage
that
there
may
be
no
talk
of
my
having
*NL*
shot
myself
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
does
say
so
.
Only
I
hope
you
wo
n't
shoot
yourself
by
accident
*NL*
any
more
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
questioning
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
wo
n't
,
but
it
would
have
been
better
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
smiled
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
these
words
and
this
smile
,
which
so
frightened
Varya
,
when
*NL*
the
inflammation
was
over
and
he
began
to
recover
,
he
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
completely
free
from
one
part
of
his
misery
.
By
his
action
he
had
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
washed
away
the
shame
and
humiliation
he
had
felt
before
.
He
could
*NL*
now
think
calmly
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
He
recognized
all
his
*NL*
magnanimity
,
but
he
did
not
now
feel
himself
humiliated
by
it
.
Besides
,
*NL*
he
got
back
again
into
the
beaten
track
of
his
life
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
possibility
of
looking
men
in
the
face
again
without
shame
,
and
he
could
*NL*
live
in
accordance
with
his
own
habits
.
One
thing
he
could
not
pluck
out
*NL*
of
his
heart
,
though
he
never
ceased
struggling
with
it
,
was
the
regret
,
*NL*
amounting
to
despair
,
that
he
had
lost
her
forever
.
That
now
,
having
*NL*
expiated
his
sin
against
the
husband
,
he
was
bound
to
renounce
her
,
and
*NL*
never
in
future
to
stand
between
her
with
her
repentance
and
her
*NL*
husband
,
he
had
firmly
decided
in
his
heart
;
but
he
could
not
tear
out
*NL*
of
his
heart
his
regret
at
the
loss
of
her
love
,
he
could
not
erase
from
*NL*
his
memory
those
moments
of
happiness
that
he
had
so
little
prized
at
*NL*
the
time
,
and
that
haunted
him
in
all
their
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
had
planned
his
appointment
at
Tashkend
,
and
Vronsky
agreed
*NL*
to
the
proposition
without
the
slightest
hesitation
.
But
the
nearer
the
*NL*
time
of
departure
came
,
the
bitterer
was
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
to
*NL*
what
he
thought
his
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wound
had
healed
,
and
he
was
driving
about
making
preparations
for
*NL*
his
departure
for
Tashkend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
her
once
and
then
to
bury
myself
,
to
die
,
''
he
thought
,
and
as
he
*NL*
was
paying
farewell
visits
,
he
uttered
this
thought
to
Betsy
.
Charged
*NL*
with
this
commission
,
Betsy
had
gone
to
Anna
,
and
brought
him
back
a
*NL*
negative
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
,
''
thought
Vronsky
,
when
he
received
the
news
.
``
It
*NL*
was
a
weakness
,
which
would
have
shattered
what
strength
I
have
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
Betsy
herself
came
to
him
in
the
morning
,
and
announced
that
*NL*
she
had
heard
through
Oblonsky
as
a
positive
fact
that
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
agreed
to
a
divorce
,
and
that
therefore
Vronsky
could
*NL*
see
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
even
troubling
himself
to
see
Betsy
out
of
his
flat
,
forgetting
*NL*
all
his
resolutions
,
without
asking
when
he
could
see
her
,
where
her
*NL*
husband
was
,
Vronsky
drove
straight
to
the
Karenins
'
.
He
ran
up
the
*NL*
stairs
seeing
no
one
and
nothing
,
and
with
a
rapid
step
,
almost
breaking
*NL*
into
a
run
,
he
went
into
her
room
.
And
without
considering
,
without
*NL*
noticing
whether
there
was
anyone
in
the
room
or
not
,
he
flung
his
arms
*NL*
round
her
,
and
began
to
cover
her
face
,
her
hands
,
her
neck
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
been
preparing
herself
for
this
meeting
,
had
thought
what
she
*NL*
would
say
to
him
,
but
she
did
not
succeed
in
saying
anything
of
it
;
his
*NL*
passion
mastered
her
.
She
tried
to
calm
him
,
to
calm
herself
,
but
it
was
*NL*
too
late
.
His
feeling
infected
her
.
Her
lips
trembled
so
that
for
a
long
*NL*
while
she
could
say
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
conquered
me
,
and
I
am
yours
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
pressing
*NL*
his
hands
to
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
had
to
be
,
''
he
said
.
``
So
long
as
we
live
,
it
must
be
so
.
I
know
*NL*
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
she
said
,
getting
whiter
and
whiter
,
and
embracing
his
*NL*
head
.
``
Still
there
is
something
terrible
in
it
after
all
that
has
*NL*
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
all
pass
,
it
will
all
pass
;
we
shall
be
so
happy
.
Our
love
,
if
*NL*
it
could
be
stronger
,
will
be
strengthened
by
there
being
something
*NL*
terrible
in
it
,
''
he
said
,
lifting
his
head
and
parting
his
strong
teeth
*NL*
in
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
could
not
but
respond
with
a
smile
--
not
to
his
words
,
but
to
the
*NL*
love
in
his
eyes
.
She
took
his
hand
and
stroked
her
chilled
cheeks
and
*NL*
cropped
head
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
you
with
this
short
hair
.
You
've
grown
so
pretty
.
A
boy
.
*NL*
But
how
pale
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
very
weak
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
And
her
lips
began
trembling
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
to
Italy
;
you
will
get
strong
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
possible
we
could
be
like
husband
and
wife
,
alone
,
your
*NL*
family
with
you
?
''
she
said
,
looking
close
into
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
only
seems
strange
to
me
that
it
can
ever
have
been
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
says
that
_
he
_
has
agreed
to
everything
,
but
I
ca
n't
accept
_
his
_
*NL*
generosity
,
''
she
said
,
looking
dreamily
past
Vronsky
's
face
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
a
divorce
;
it
's
all
the
same
to
me
now
.
Only
I
do
n't
know
what
he
*NL*
will
decide
about
Seryozha
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
conceive
how
at
this
moment
of
their
meeting
she
could
*NL*
remember
and
think
of
her
son
,
of
divorce
.
What
did
it
all
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
that
,
do
n't
think
of
it
,
''
he
said
,
turning
her
hand
in
*NL*
his
,
and
trying
to
draw
her
attention
to
him
;
but
still
she
did
not
look
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
did
n't
I
die
!
it
would
have
been
better
,
''
she
said
,
and
silent
*NL*
tears
flowed
down
both
her
cheeks
;
but
she
tried
to
smile
,
so
as
not
to
*NL*
wound
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
decline
the
flattering
and
dangerous
appointment
at
Tashkend
would
*NL*
have
been
,
Vronsky
had
till
then
considered
,
disgraceful
and
impossible
.
*NL*
But
now
,
without
an
instant
's
consideration
,
he
declined
it
,
and
*NL*
observing
dissatisfaction
in
the
most
exalted
quarters
at
this
step
,
he
*NL*
immediately
retired
from
the
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
later
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
left
alone
with
his
son
in
his
*NL*
house
at
Petersburg
,
while
Anna
and
Vronsky
had
gone
abroad
,
not
having
*NL*
obtained
a
divorce
,
but
having
absolutely
declined
all
idea
of
one
.

*NL*
PART
FIVE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
considered
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
*NL*
the
wedding
to
take
place
before
Lent
,
just
five
weeks
off
,
since
not
*NL*
half
the
trousseau
could
possibly
be
ready
by
that
time
.
But
she
could
*NL*
not
but
agree
with
Levin
that
to
fix
it
for
after
Lent
would
be
putting
*NL*
it
off
too
late
,
as
an
old
aunt
of
Prince
Shtcherbatsky
's
was
seriously
*NL*
ill
and
might
die
,
and
then
the
mourning
would
delay
the
wedding
still
*NL*
longer
.
And
therefore
,
deciding
to
divide
the
trousseau
into
two
*NL*
parts
--
a
larger
and
smaller
trousseau
--
the
princess
consented
to
have
*NL*
the
wedding
before
Lent
.
She
determined
that
she
would
get
the
smaller
*NL*
part
of
the
trousseau
all
ready
now
,
and
the
larger
part
should
be
made
*NL*
later
,
and
she
was
much
vexed
with
Levin
because
he
was
incapable
of
*NL*
giving
her
a
serious
answer
to
the
question
whether
he
agreed
to
this
*NL*
arrangement
or
not
.
The
arrangement
was
the
more
suitable
as
,
*NL*
immediately
after
the
wedding
,
the
young
people
were
to
go
to
the
*NL*
country
,
where
the
more
important
part
of
the
trousseau
would
not
be
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
still
continued
in
the
same
delirious
condition
in
which
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
he
and
his
happiness
constituted
the
chief
and
sole
aim
of
*NL*
all
existence
,
and
that
he
need
not
now
think
or
care
about
anything
,
*NL*
that
everything
was
being
done
and
would
be
done
for
him
by
others
.
He
*NL*
had
not
even
plans
and
aims
for
the
future
,
he
left
its
arrangement
to
*NL*
others
,
knowing
that
everything
would
be
delightful
.
His
brother
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
the
princess
guided
him
in
doing
*NL*
what
he
had
to
do
.
All
he
did
was
to
agree
entirely
with
everything
*NL*
suggested
to
him
.
His
brother
raised
money
for
him
,
the
princess
advised
*NL*
him
to
leave
Moscow
after
the
wedding
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
advised
him
*NL*
to
go
abroad
.
He
agreed
to
everything
.
``
Do
what
you
choose
,
if
it
amuses
*NL*
you
.
I
'm
happy
,
and
my
happiness
can
be
no
greater
and
no
less
for
*NL*
anything
you
do
,
''
he
thought
.
When
he
told
Kitty
of
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
advice
that
they
should
go
abroad
,
he
was
much
surprised
*NL*
that
she
did
not
agree
to
this
,
and
had
some
definite
requirements
of
*NL*
her
own
in
regard
to
their
future
.
She
knew
Levin
had
work
he
loved
in
*NL*
the
country
.
She
did
not
,
as
he
saw
,
understand
this
work
,
she
did
not
*NL*
even
care
to
understand
it
.
But
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
regarding
*NL*
it
as
a
matter
of
great
importance
.
And
then
she
knew
their
home
would
*NL*
be
in
the
country
,
and
she
wanted
to
go
,
not
abroad
where
she
was
not
*NL*
going
to
live
,
but
to
the
place
where
their
home
would
be
.
This
*NL*
definitely
expressed
purpose
astonished
Levin
.
But
since
he
did
not
care
*NL*
either
way
,
he
immediately
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
though
it
were
*NL*
his
duty
,
to
go
down
to
the
country
and
to
arrange
everything
there
to
*NL*
the
best
of
his
ability
with
the
taste
of
which
he
had
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
say
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
him
one
day
after
he
had
come
*NL*
back
from
the
country
,
where
he
had
got
everything
ready
for
the
young
*NL*
people
's
arrival
,
``
have
you
a
certificate
of
having
been
at
confession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
But
what
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
be
married
without
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Aie
,
aie
,
aie
!
_
''
cried
Levin
.
``
Why
,
I
believe
it
's
nine
years
since
*NL*
I
've
taken
the
sacrament
!
I
never
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
pretty
fellow
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
laughing
,
``
and
you
*NL*
call
me
a
Nihilist
!
But
this
wo
n't
do
,
you
know
.
You
must
take
the
*NL*
sacrament
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
There
are
four
days
left
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
arranged
this
also
,
and
Levin
had
to
go
to
*NL*
confession
.
To
Levin
,
as
to
any
unbeliever
who
respects
the
beliefs
of
*NL*
others
,
it
was
exceedingly
disagreeable
to
be
present
at
and
take
part
*NL*
in
church
ceremonies
.
At
this
moment
,
in
his
present
softened
state
of
*NL*
feeling
,
sensitive
to
everything
,
this
inevitable
act
of
hypocrisy
was
*NL*
not
merely
painful
to
Levin
,
it
seemed
to
him
utterly
impossible
.
Now
,
*NL*
in
the
heyday
of
his
highest
glory
,
his
fullest
flower
,
he
would
have
to
*NL*
be
a
liar
or
a
scoffer
.
He
felt
incapable
of
being
either
.
But
though
he
*NL*
repeatedly
plied
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
questions
as
to
the
*NL*
possibility
of
obtaining
a
certificate
without
actually
communicating
,
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
maintained
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
what
is
it
to
you
--
two
days
?
And
he
's
an
awfully
nice
clever
*NL*
old
fellow
.
He
'll
pull
the
tooth
out
for
you
so
gently
,
you
wo
n't
notice
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
at
the
first
litany
,
Levin
attempted
to
revive
in
himself
his
*NL*
youthful
recollections
of
the
intense
religious
emotion
he
had
passed
*NL*
through
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
at
once
convinced
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
him
.
He
*NL*
attempted
to
look
at
it
all
as
an
empty
custom
,
having
no
sort
of
*NL*
meaning
,
like
the
custom
of
paying
calls
.
But
he
felt
that
he
could
not
*NL*
do
that
either
.
Levin
found
himself
,
like
the
majority
of
his
*NL*
contemporaries
,
in
the
vaguest
position
in
regard
to
religion
.
Believe
*NL*
he
could
not
,
and
at
the
same
time
he
had
no
firm
conviction
that
it
was
*NL*
all
wrong
.
And
consequently
,
not
being
able
to
believe
in
the
*NL*
significance
of
what
he
was
doing
nor
to
regard
it
with
indifference
as
*NL*
an
empty
formality
,
during
the
whole
period
of
preparing
for
the
*NL*
sacrament
he
was
conscious
of
a
feeling
of
discomfort
and
shame
at
doing
*NL*
what
he
did
not
himself
understand
,
and
what
,
as
an
inner
voice
told
*NL*
him
,
was
therefore
false
and
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
service
he
would
first
listen
to
the
prayers
,
trying
to
*NL*
attach
some
meaning
to
them
not
discordant
with
his
own
views
;
then
*NL*
feeling
that
he
could
not
understand
and
must
condemn
them
,
he
tried
not
*NL*
to
listen
to
them
,
but
to
attend
to
the
thoughts
,
observations
,
and
*NL*
memories
which
floated
through
his
brain
with
extreme
vividness
during
*NL*
this
idle
time
of
standing
in
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stood
through
the
litany
,
the
evening
service
and
the
midnight
*NL*
service
,
and
the
next
day
he
got
up
earlier
than
usual
,
and
without
*NL*
having
tea
went
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
the
church
for
the
*NL*
morning
service
and
the
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
church
but
a
beggar
soldier
,
two
old
women
,
and
*NL*
the
church
officials
.
A
young
deacon
,
whose
long
back
showed
in
two
*NL*
distinct
halves
through
his
thin
undercassock
,
met
him
,
and
at
once
*NL*
going
to
a
little
table
at
the
wall
read
the
exhortation
.
During
the
*NL*
reading
,
especially
at
the
frequent
and
rapid
repetition
of
the
same
*NL*
words
,
``
Lord
,
have
mercy
on
us
!
''
which
resounded
with
an
echo
,
Levin
*NL*
felt
that
thought
was
shut
and
sealed
up
,
and
that
it
must
not
be
*NL*
touched
or
stirred
now
or
confusion
would
be
the
result
;
and
so
standing
*NL*
behind
the
deacon
he
went
on
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
,
neither
*NL*
listening
nor
examining
what
was
said
.
``
It
's
wonderful
what
expression
*NL*
there
is
in
her
hand
,
''
he
thought
,
remembering
how
they
had
been
sitting
*NL*
the
day
before
at
a
corner
table
.
They
had
nothing
to
talk
about
,
as
was
*NL*
almost
always
the
case
at
this
time
,
and
laying
her
hand
on
the
table
*NL*
she
kept
opening
and
shutting
it
,
and
laughed
herself
as
she
watched
her
*NL*
action
.
He
remembered
how
he
had
kissed
it
and
then
had
examined
the
*NL*
lines
on
the
pink
palm
.
``
Have
mercy
on
us
again
!
''
thought
Levin
,
*NL*
crossing
himself
,
bowing
,
and
looking
at
the
supple
spring
of
the
*NL*
deacon
's
back
bowing
before
him
.
``
She
took
my
hand
then
and
examined
the
*NL*
lines
`
You
've
got
a
splendid
hand
,
'
she
said
.
''
And
he
looked
at
his
own
*NL*
hand
and
the
short
hand
of
the
deacon
.
``
Yes
,
now
it
will
soon
be
over
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
.
``
No
,
it
seems
to
be
beginning
again
,
''
he
thought
,
listening
*NL*
to
the
prayers
.
``
No
,
it
's
just
ending
:
there
he
is
bowing
down
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
That
's
always
at
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
deacon
's
hand
in
a
plush
cuff
accepted
a
three-rouble
note
*NL*
unobtrusively
,
and
the
deacon
said
he
would
put
it
down
in
the
register
,
*NL*
and
his
new
boots
creaking
jauntily
over
the
flagstones
of
the
empty
*NL*
church
,
he
went
to
the
altar
.
A
moment
later
he
peeped
out
thence
and
*NL*
beckoned
to
Levin
.
Thought
,
till
then
locked
up
,
began
to
stir
in
*NL*
Levin
's
head
,
but
he
made
haste
to
drive
it
away
.
``
It
will
come
right
*NL*
somehow
,
''
he
thought
,
and
went
towards
the
altar-rails
.
He
went
up
the
*NL*
steps
,
and
turning
to
the
right
saw
the
priest
.
The
priest
,
a
little
old
*NL*
man
with
a
scanty
grizzled
beard
and
weary
,
good-natured
eyes
,
was
*NL*
standing
at
the
altar-rails
,
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
missal
.
With
a
*NL*
slight
bow
to
Levin
he
began
immediately
reading
prayers
in
the
official
*NL*
voice
.
When
he
had
finished
them
he
bowed
down
to
the
ground
and
turned
,
*NL*
facing
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christ
is
present
here
unseen
,
receiving
your
confession
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
crucifix
.
``
Do
you
believe
in
all
the
doctrines
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Apostolic
Church
?
''
the
priest
went
on
,
turning
his
eyes
away
from
*NL*
Levin
's
face
and
folding
his
hands
under
his
stole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
doubted
,
I
doubt
everything
,
''
said
Levin
in
a
voice
that
jarred
*NL*
on
himself
,
and
he
ceased
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
waited
a
few
seconds
to
see
if
he
would
not
say
more
,
and
*NL*
closing
his
eyes
he
said
quickly
,
with
a
broad
,
Vladimirsky
accent
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubt
is
natural
to
the
weakness
of
mankind
,
but
we
must
pray
that
God
*NL*
in
His
mercy
will
strengthen
us
.
What
are
your
special
sins
?
''
he
added
,
*NL*
without
the
slightest
interval
,
as
though
anxious
not
to
waste
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
chief
sin
is
doubt
.
I
have
doubts
of
everything
,
and
for
the
most
*NL*
part
I
am
in
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubt
is
natural
to
the
weakness
of
mankind
,
''
the
priest
repeated
the
*NL*
same
words
.
``
What
do
you
doubt
about
principally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
doubt
of
everything
.
I
sometimes
even
have
doubts
of
the
existence
of
*NL*
God
,
''
Levin
could
not
help
saying
,
and
he
was
horrified
at
the
*NL*
impropriety
of
what
he
was
saying
.
But
Levin
's
words
did
not
,
it
seemed
,
*NL*
make
much
impression
on
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
doubt
can
there
be
of
the
existence
of
God
?
''
he
said
*NL*
hurriedly
,
with
a
just
perceptible
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
doubt
can
you
have
of
the
Creator
when
you
behold
His
creation
?
''
*NL*
the
priest
went
on
in
the
rapid
customary
jargon
.
``
Who
has
decked
the
*NL*
heavenly
firmament
with
its
lights
?
Who
has
clothed
the
earth
in
its
*NL*
beauty
?
How
explain
it
without
the
Creator
?
''
he
said
,
looking
*NL*
inquiringly
at
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
that
it
would
be
improper
to
enter
upon
a
metaphysical
*NL*
discussion
with
the
priest
,
and
so
he
said
in
reply
merely
what
was
a
*NL*
direct
answer
to
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
!
Then
how
can
you
doubt
that
God
created
all
?
''
the
*NL*
priest
said
,
with
good-humored
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
it
at
all
,
''
said
Levin
,
blushing
,
and
feeling
that
*NL*
his
words
were
stupid
,
and
that
they
could
not
be
anything
but
stupid
in
*NL*
such
a
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
to
God
and
beseech
Him
.
Even
the
holy
fathers
had
doubts
,
and
*NL*
prayed
to
God
to
strengthen
their
faith
.
The
devil
has
great
power
,
and
*NL*
we
must
resist
him
.
Pray
to
God
,
beseech
Him
.
Pray
to
God
,
''
he
repeated
*NL*
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
paused
for
some
time
,
as
though
meditating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
about
,
I
hear
,
to
marry
the
daughter
of
my
parishioner
and
son
*NL*
in
the
spirit
,
Prince
Shtcherbatsky
?
''
he
resumed
,
with
a
smile
.
``
An
*NL*
excellent
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Levin
,
blushing
for
the
priest
.
``
What
does
he
want
to
*NL*
ask
me
about
this
at
confession
for
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
though
answering
his
thought
,
the
priest
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
about
to
enter
into
holy
matrimony
,
and
God
may
bless
you
with
*NL*
offspring
.
Well
,
what
sort
of
bringing-up
can
you
give
your
babes
if
you
*NL*
do
not
overcome
the
temptation
of
the
devil
,
enticing
you
to
*NL*
infidelity
?
''
he
said
,
with
gentle
reproachfulness
.
``
If
you
love
your
*NL*
child
as
a
good
father
,
you
will
not
desire
only
wealth
,
luxury
,
honor
*NL*
for
your
infant
;
you
will
be
anxious
for
his
salvation
,
his
spiritual
*NL*
enlightenment
with
the
light
of
truth
.
Eh
?
What
answer
will
you
make
him
*NL*
when
the
innocent
babe
asks
you
:
`
Papa
!
who
made
all
that
enchants
me
in
*NL*
this
world
--
the
earth
,
the
waters
,
the
sun
,
the
flowers
,
the
grass
?
'
Can
*NL*
you
say
to
him
:
'
I
do
n't
know
'
?
You
can
not
but
know
,
since
the
Lord
God
*NL*
in
His
infinite
mercy
has
revealed
it
to
us
.
Or
your
child
will
ask
you
:
*NL*
`
What
awaits
me
in
the
life
beyond
the
tomb
?
'
What
will
you
say
to
him
*NL*
when
you
know
nothing
?
How
will
you
answer
him
?
Will
you
leave
him
to
*NL*
the
allurements
of
the
world
and
the
devil
?
That
's
not
right
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
and
he
stopped
,
putting
his
head
on
one
side
and
looking
at
Levin
with
*NL*
his
kindly
,
gentle
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
made
no
answer
this
time
,
not
because
he
did
not
want
to
enter
*NL*
upon
a
discussion
with
the
priest
,
but
because
,
so
far
,
no
one
had
ever
*NL*
asked
him
such
questions
,
and
when
his
babes
did
ask
him
those
*NL*
questions
,
it
would
be
time
enough
to
think
about
answering
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
entering
upon
a
time
of
life
,
''
pursued
the
priest
,
``
when
you
*NL*
must
choose
your
path
and
keep
to
it
.
Pray
to
God
that
He
may
in
His
*NL*
mercy
aid
you
and
have
mercy
on
you
!
''
he
concluded
.
``
Our
Lord
and
God
,
*NL*
Jesus
Christ
,
in
the
abundance
and
riches
of
His
lovingkindness
,
*NL*
forgives
this
child
...
''
and
,
finishing
the
prayer
of
absolution
,
the
*NL*
priest
blessed
him
and
dismissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
getting
home
that
day
,
Levin
had
a
delightful
sense
of
relief
at
the
*NL*
awkward
position
being
over
and
having
been
got
through
without
his
*NL*
having
to
tell
a
lie
.
Apart
from
this
,
there
remained
a
vague
memory
*NL*
that
what
the
kind
,
nice
old
fellow
had
said
had
not
been
at
all
so
*NL*
stupid
as
he
had
fancied
at
first
,
and
that
there
was
something
in
it
*NL*
that
must
be
cleared
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
not
now
,
''
thought
Levin
,
``
but
some
day
later
on
.
''
Levin
felt
*NL*
more
than
ever
now
that
there
was
something
not
clear
and
not
clean
in
*NL*
his
soul
,
and
that
,
in
regard
to
religion
,
he
was
in
the
same
position
*NL*
which
he
perceived
so
clearly
and
disliked
in
others
,
and
for
which
he
*NL*
blamed
his
friend
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
spent
that
evening
with
his
betrothed
at
Dolly
's
,
and
was
in
very
*NL*
high
spirits
.
To
explain
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
the
state
of
excitement
*NL*
in
which
he
found
himself
,
he
said
that
he
was
happy
like
a
dog
being
*NL*
trained
to
jump
through
a
hoop
,
who
,
having
at
last
caught
the
idea
,
and
*NL*
done
what
was
required
of
him
,
whines
and
wags
its
tail
,
and
jumps
up
to
*NL*
the
table
and
the
windows
in
its
delight
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
of
the
wedding
,
according
to
the
Russian
custom
-LRB-
the
princess
*NL*
and
Darya
Alexandrovna
insisted
on
strictly
keeping
all
the
customs
-RRB-
,
*NL*
Levin
did
not
see
his
betrothed
,
and
dined
at
his
hotel
with
three
*NL*
bachelor
friends
,
casually
brought
together
at
his
rooms
.
These
were
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
Katavasov
,
a
university
friend
,
now
professor
of
*NL*
natural
science
,
whom
Levin
had
met
in
the
street
and
insisted
on
taking
*NL*
home
with
him
,
and
Tchirikov
,
his
best
man
,
a
Moscow
conciliation-board
*NL*
judge
,
Levin
's
companion
in
his
bear-hunts
.
The
dinner
was
a
very
merry
*NL*
one
:
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
in
his
happiest
mood
,
and
was
much
amused
by
*NL*
Katavasov
's
originality
.
Katavasov
,
feeling
his
originality
was
*NL*
appreciated
and
understood
,
made
the
most
of
it
.
Tchirikov
always
gave
a
*NL*
lively
and
good-humored
support
to
conversation
of
any
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
now
,
''
said
Katavasov
,
drawling
his
words
from
a
habit
acquired
in
*NL*
the
lecture-room
,
``
what
a
capable
fellow
was
our
friend
Konstantin
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
.
I
'm
not
speaking
of
present
company
,
for
he
's
absent
.
At
*NL*
the
time
he
left
the
university
he
was
fond
of
science
,
took
an
interest
*NL*
in
humanity
;
now
one-half
of
his
abilities
is
devoted
to
deceiving
*NL*
himself
,
and
the
other
to
justifying
the
deceit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
more
determined
enemy
of
matrimony
than
you
I
never
saw
,
''
said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
not
an
enemy
of
matrimony
.
I
'm
in
favor
of
division
of
*NL*
labor
.
People
who
can
do
nothing
else
ought
to
rear
people
while
the
*NL*
rest
work
for
their
happiness
and
enlightenment
.
That
's
how
I
look
at
*NL*
it
.
To
muddle
up
two
trades
is
the
error
of
the
amateur
;
I
'm
not
one
of
*NL*
their
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
happy
I
shall
be
when
I
hear
that
you
're
in
love

''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
``
Please
invite
me
to
the
wedding

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
in
love
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
with
a
cuttlefish
!
You
know
,
''
Levin
turned
to
his
brother
,
``
Mihail
*NL*
Semyonovitch
is
writing
a
work
on
the
digestive
organs
of
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
make
a
muddle
of
it

It
does
n't
matter
what
about

And
the
fact
*NL*
is
,
I
certainly
do
love
cuttlefish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
no
hindrance
to
your
loving
your
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cuttlefish
is
no
hindrance
.
The
wife
is
the
hindrance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
see
!
You
care
about
farming
,
hunting
,

well
,
you
'd
better
*NL*
look
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arhip
was
here
today
;
he
said
there
were
a
lot
of
elks
in
Prudno
,
and
*NL*
two
bears
,

said
Tchirikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
must
go
and
get
them
without
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
the
truth
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
And
you
may
say
*NL*
good-bye
to
bear-hunting
for
the
future
--
your
wife
wo
n't
allow
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
smiled
.
The
picture
of
his
wife
not
letting
him
go
was
so
pleasant
*NL*
that
he
was
ready
to
renounce
the
delights
of
looking
upon
bears
*NL*
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
it
's
a
pity
they
should
get
those
two
bears
without
you

Do
you
*NL*
remember
last
time
at
Hapilovo
?
That
was
a
delightful
hunt
!
''
said
*NL*
Tchirikov
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
not
the
heart
to
disillusion
him
of
the
notion
that
there
*NL*
could
be
something
delightful
apart
from
her
,
and
so
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
some
sense
in
this
custom
of
saying
good-bye
to
bachelor
life
,
''
*NL*
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
However
happy
you
may
be
,
you
must
regret
your
*NL*
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
confess
there
is
a
feeling
that
you
want
to
jump
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
like
Gogol

bridegroom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
is
,
but
it
is
n't
confessed

''
said
Katavasov
,
and
he
*NL*
broke
into
loud
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
the
window
's
open

Let

start
off
this
instant
to
Tver

*NL*
There
's
a
big
she-bear

one
can
go
right
up

Seriously

let

go
by
the
five
o'clock

And
here
let

do
what

said
*NL*
Tchirikov
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
on
my
honor
,
''
said
Levin
,
smiling
,
``
I
ca
n't
find
in
my
heart
*NL*
that
feeling
of
regret
for
my
freedom

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
such
a
chaos
in
your
heart
just
now
that
you
ca
n't
find
*NL*
anything
there
,

said
Katavasov
.
``
Wait
a
bit
,
when
you
set
it
to

*NL*
a
little

you
'll
find
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

if
so
,
I
should
have
felt
a
little
,
apart
from
my
feeling

-LRB-
he
*NL*
could
not
say
love
before
them
-RRB-
``
and
happiness
,
a
certain
regret
at
*NL*
losing
my
freedom

On

glad

loss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Awful
!
It
's
a
hopeless
case

Katavasov
.
``
Well
,
let
's
drink
to
his
*NL*
recovery

or
wish
that
a

be

realized

and
that
would
be
happiness
such

''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
dinner
the
guests
went
away
to
be
in
time
to
be
dressed
for
*NL*
the
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
left
alone
,
and
recalled
the
conversation
of
these
bachelor
*NL*
friends
,
Levin
asked
himself
:
had
he
in
his
heart
that
regret
for
his
*NL*
freedom
of
which
they
had
spoken
?
He
smiled
at
the
question
.
``
Freedom
!
*NL*
What
is
freedom
for
?
Happiness
is
only
in
loving
and
wishing
her
wishes
,
*NL*
thinking
her
thoughts
,
that
is
to
say
,
not
freedom
at
all
--
that
's
*NL*
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
I
know
her
ideas
,
her
wishes
,
her
feelings
?
''
some
voice
suddenly
*NL*
whispered
to
him
.
The
smile
died
away
from
his
face
,
and
he
grew
*NL*
thoughtful
.
And
suddenly
a
strange
feeling
came
upon
him
.
There
came
*NL*
over
him
a
dread
and
doubt
--
doubt
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
she
does
not
love
me
?
What
if
she
's
marrying
me
simply
to
be
*NL*
married
?
What
if
she
does
n't
see
herself
what
she
's
doing
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
himself
.
``
She
may
come
to
her
senses
,
and
only
when
she
is
being
married
*NL*
realize
that
she
does
not
and
can
not
love
me
.
''
And
strange
,
most
evil
*NL*
thoughts
of
her
began
to
come
to
him
.
He
was
jealous
of
Vronsky
,
as
he
*NL*
had
been
a
year
ago
,
as
though
the
evening
he
had
seen
her
with
Vronsky
*NL*
had
been
yesterday
.
He
suspected
she
had
not
told
him
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
up
quickly
.
``
No
,
this
ca
n't
go
on
!
''
he
said
to
himself
in
*NL*
despair
.
``
I
'll
go
to
her
;
I
'll
ask
her
;
I
'll
say
for
the
last
time
:
we
*NL*
are
free
,
and
had
n't
we
better
stay
so
?
Anything
's
better
than
endless
*NL*
misery
,
disgrace
,
unfaithfulness
!
''
With
despair
in
his
heart
and
bitter
*NL*
anger
against
all
men
,
against
himself
,
against
her
,
he
went
out
of
the
*NL*
hotel
and
drove
to
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
her
in
one
of
the
back
rooms
.
She
was
sitting
on
a
chest
and
*NL*
making
some
arrangements
with
her
maid
,
sorting
over
heaps
of
dresses
of
*NL*
different
colors
,
spread
on
the
backs
of
chairs
and
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
cried
,
seeing
him
,
and
beaming
with
delight
.
``
Kostya
!
*NL*
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
!
''
-LRB-
These
latter
days
she
used
these
names
almost
*NL*
alternately
.
-RRB-
``
I
did
n't
expect
you
!
I
'm
going
through
my
wardrobe
to
see
*NL*
what
's
for
whom
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
's
very
nice

he
said
gloomily
,
looking
at
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
,
Dunyasha
,
I
'll
call
you
presently
,
''
said
Kitty
.
``
Kostya
,
*NL*
what
's
the
matter
?
''
she
asked
,
definitely
adopting
this
familiar
name
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
maid
had
gone
out
.
She
noticed
his
strange
face
,
agitated
*NL*
and
gloomy
,
and
a
panic
came
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
!
I
'm
in
torture
.
I
ca
n't
suffer
alone
,
''
he
said
with
despair
in
*NL*
his
voice
,
standing
before
her
and
looking
imploringly
into
her
eyes
.
He
*NL*
saw
already
from
her
loving
,
truthful
face
,
that
nothing
could
come
of
*NL*
what
he
had
meant
to
say
,
but
yet
he
wanted
her
to
reassure
him
herself
.
*NL*
``
I
've
come
to
say
that
there
's
still
time
.
This
can
all
be
stopped
and
*NL*
set
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
I
do
n't
understand
.
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
have
said
a
thousand
times
over

help
thinking

not
worthy
of

could
n't
consent
to
marry
me

Think
a

little

You

made

Think
it
over
thoroughly

You
ca

so

''
he
said
,
not
looking
at
her
.
``
I
shall
be
*NL*
wretched
.
Let
people
say
what
they
like

Far
better
now
while
there
's
still
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand

she
answered
,
panic-stricken
;
``
you
mean
you
want
*NL*
to
give
it
up
...
do
n't
want
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
you
do
n't
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
out
of
your
mind
!
''
she
cried
,
turning
crimson
with
vexation
.
But
*NL*
his
face
was
so
piteous
,
that
she
restrained
her
vexation
,
and
flinging
*NL*
some
clothes
off
an
arm-chair
,
she
sat
down
beside
him
.
``
What
are
you
*NL*
thinking
?
tell
me
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thinking
you
ca
n't
love
me

What
can
you
love
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
what
can
I
do
?
...
''
she
said
,
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
what
have
I
done
?
''
he
cried
,
and
kneeling
before
her
,
he
fell
to
*NL*
kissing
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
princess
came
into
the
room
five
minutes
later
,
she
found
them
*NL*
completely
reconciled
.
Kitty
had
not
simply
assured
him
that
she
loved
*NL*
him
,
but
had
gone
so
far
--
in
answer
to
his
question
,
what
she
loved
him
*NL*
for
--
as
to
explain
what
for
.
She
told
him
that
she
loved
him
because
she
*NL*
understood
him
completely
,
because
she
knew
what
he
would
like
,
and
*NL*
because
everything
he
liked
was
good
.
And
this
seemed
to
him
perfectly
*NL*
clear
.
When
the
princess
came
to
them
,
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
*NL*
the
chest
,
sorting
the
dresses
and
disputing
over
Kitty
's
wanting
to
*NL*
give
Dunyasha
the
brown
dress
she
had
been
wearing
when
Levin
proposed
*NL*
to
her
,
while
he
insisted
that
that
dress
must
never
be
given
away
,
but
*NL*
Dunyasha
must
have
the
blue
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
you
do
n't
see
?
She
's
a
brunette
,
and
it
wo
n't
suit
her

*NL*
I
've
worked
it
all
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
why
he
had
come
,
the
princess
was
half
humorously
,
half
*NL*
seriously
angry
with
him
,
and
sent
him
home
to
dress
and
not
to
hinder
*NL*
Kitty
's
hair-dressing
,
as
Charles
the
hair-dresser
was
just
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
it
is
,
she
's
been
eating
nothing
lately
and
is
losing
her
looks

and
*NL*
then
you
must
come
and
upset
her
with
your
nonsense

she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
``
Get
along
with
you
,
my
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
guilty
and
shamefaced
,
but
pacified
,
went
back
to
his
hotel
.
His
*NL*
brother
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
all
in
full
dress
,
*NL*
were
waiting
for
him
to
bless
him
with
the
holy
picture
.
There
was
no
*NL*
time
to
lose
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
to
drive
home
again
to
fetch
her
*NL*
curled
and
pomaded
son
,
who
was
to
carry
the
holy
pictures
after
the
*NL*
bride
.
Then
a
carriage
had
to
be
sent
for
the
best
man
,
and
another
that
*NL*
would
take
Sergey
Ivanovitch
away
would
have
to
be
sent
back
...
*NL*
Altogether
there
were
a
great
many
most
complicated
matters
to
be
*NL*
considered
and
arranged
.
One
thing
was
unmistakable
,
that
there
must
be
*NL*
no
delay
,
as
it
was
already
half-past
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
special
happened
at
the
ceremony
of
benediction
with
the
holy
*NL*
picture
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
stood
in
a
comically
solemn
pose
beside
his
*NL*
wife
,
took
the
holy
picture
,
and
telling
Levin
to
bow
down
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
he
blessed
him
with
his
kindly
,
ironical
smile
,
and
kissed
him
*NL*
three
times
;
Darya
Alexandrovna
did
the
same
,
and
immediately
was
in
a
*NL*
hurry
to
get
off
,
and
again
plunged
into
the
intricate
question
of
the
*NL*
destinations
of
the
various
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
I
'll
tell
you
how
we
'll
manage
:
you
drive
in
our
carriage
to
*NL*
fetch
him
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
if
he
'll
be
so
good
,
will
drive
there
*NL*
and
then
send
his
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
I
shall
be
delighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
come
on
directly
with
him
.
Are
your
things
sent
off
?
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Levin
,
and
he
told
Kouzma
to
put
out
his
clothes
for
him
*NL*
to
dress
.

A
crowd
of
people
,
principally
women
,
was
thronging
round
the
church
*NL*
lighted
up
for
the
wedding
.
Those
who
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
into
*NL*
the
main
entrance
were
crowding
about
the
windows
,
pushing
,
wrangling
,
*NL*
and
peeping
through
the
gratings
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
twenty
carriages
had
already
been
drawn
up
in
ranks
along
the
*NL*
street
by
the
police
.
A
police
officer
,
regardless
of
the
frost
,
stood
*NL*
at
the
entrance
,
gorgeous
in
his
uniform
.
More
carriages
were
*NL*
continually
driving
up
,
and
ladies
wearing
flowers
and
carrying
their
*NL*
trains
,
and
men
taking
off
their
helmets
or
black
hats
kept
walking
into
*NL*
the
church
.
Inside
the
church
both
lusters
were
already
lighted
,
and
all
*NL*
the
candles
before
the
holy
pictures
.
The
gilt
on
the
red
ground
of
the
*NL*
holy
picture-stand
,
and
the
gilt
relief
on
the
pictures
,
and
the
silver
*NL*
of
the
lusters
and
candlesticks
,
and
the
stones
of
the
floor
,
and
the
*NL*
rugs
,
and
the
banners
above
in
the
choir
,
and
the
steps
of
the
altar
,
*NL*
and
the
old
blackened
books
,
and
the
cassocks
and
surplices
--
all
were
*NL*
flooded
with
light
.
On
the
right
side
of
the
warm
church
,
in
the
crowd
*NL*
of
frock
coats
and
white
ties
,
uniforms
and
broadcloth
,
velvet
,
satin
,
*NL*
hair
and
flowers
,
bare
shoulders
and
arms
and
long
gloves
,
there
was
*NL*
discreet
but
lively
conversation
that
echoed
strangely
in
the
high
*NL*
cupola
.
Every
time
there
was
heard
the
creak
of
the
opened
door
the
*NL*
conversation
in
the
crowd
died
away
,
and
everybody
looked
round
*NL*
expecting
to
see
the
bride
and
bridegroom
come
in
.
But
the
door
had
*NL*
opened
more
than
ten
times
,
and
each
time
it
was
either
a
belated
guest
*NL*
or
guests
,
who
joined
the
circle
of
the
invited
on
the
right
,
or
a
*NL*
spectator
,
who
had
eluded
or
softened
the
police
officer
,
and
went
to
*NL*
join
the
crowd
of
outsiders
on
the
left
.
Both
the
guests
and
the
outside
*NL*
public
had
by
now
passed
through
all
the
phases
of
anticipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
they
imagined
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
would
arrive
*NL*
immediately
,
and
attached
no
importance
at
all
to
their
being
late
.
Then
*NL*
they
began
to
look
more
and
more
often
towards
the
door
,
and
to
talk
of
*NL*
whether
anything
could
have
happened
.
Then
the
long
delay
began
to
be
*NL*
positively
discomforting
,
and
relations
and
guests
tried
to
look
as
if
*NL*
they
were
not
thinking
of
the
bridegroom
but
were
engrossed
in
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
deacon
,
as
though
to
remind
them
of
the
value
of
his
time
,
*NL*
coughed
impatiently
,
making
the
window-panes
quiver
in
their
frames
.
In
*NL*
the
choir
the
bored
choristers
could
be
heard
trying
their
voices
and
*NL*
blowing
their
noses
.
The
priest
was
continually
sending
first
the
beadle
*NL*
and
then
the
deacon
to
find
out
whether
the
bridegroom
had
not
come
,
*NL*
more
and
more
often
he
went
himself
,
in
a
lilac
vestment
and
an
*NL*
embroidered
sash
,
to
the
side
door
,
expecting
to
see
the
bridegroom
.
At
*NL*
last
one
of
the
ladies
,
glancing
at
her
watch
,
said
,
``
It
really
is
*NL*
strange
,
though
!
''
and
all
the
guests
became
uneasy
and
began
loudly
*NL*
expressing
their
wonder
and
dissatisfaction
.
One
of
the
bridegroom
's
*NL*
best
men
went
to
find
out
what
had
happened
.
Kitty
meanwhile
had
long
*NL*
ago
been
quite
ready
,
and
in
her
white
dress
and
long
veil
and
wreath
of
*NL*
orange
blossoms
she
was
standing
in
the
drawing-room
of
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
with
her
sister
,
Madame
Lvova
,
who
was
her
*NL*
bridal-mother
.
She
was
looking
out
of
the
window
,
and
had
been
for
over
*NL*
half
an
hour
anxiously
expecting
to
hear
from
the
best
man
that
her
*NL*
bridegroom
was
at
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
meanwhile
,
in
his
trousers
,
but
without
his
coat
and
waistcoat
,
*NL*
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
his
room
at
the
hotel
,
continually
putting
his
*NL*
head
out
of
the
door
and
looking
up
and
down
the
corridor
.
But
in
the
*NL*
corridor
there
was
no
sign
of
the
person
he
was
looking
for
and
he
came
*NL*
back
in
despair
,
and
frantically
waving
his
hands
addressed
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
who
was
smoking
serenely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
ever
a
man
in
such
a
fearful
fool
's
position
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
stupid
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
assented
,
smiling
soothingly
.
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
worry
,
it
'll
be
brought
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
what
is
to
be
done
!
''
said
Levin
,
with
smothered
fury
.
``
And
these
*NL*
fools
of
open
waistcoats
!
Out
of
the
question
!
''
he
said
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
crumpled
front
of
his
shirt
.
``
And
what
if
the
things
have
been
taken
on
*NL*
to
the
railway
station
!
''
he
roared
in
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
put
on
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
done
so
long
ago
,
if
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
nice
to
look
ridiculous
...
Wait
a
bit
!
it
will
_
come
round
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
was
that
when
Levin
asked
for
his
evening
suit
,
Kouzma
,
his
*NL*
old
servant
,
had
brought
him
the
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
everything
that
*NL*
was
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
shirt
!
''
cried
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
a
shirt
on
,
''
Kouzma
answered
,
with
a
placid
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kouzma
had
not
thought
of
leaving
out
a
clean
shirt
,
and
on
receiving
*NL*
instructions
to
pack
up
everything
and
send
it
round
to
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
,
from
which
the
young
people
were
to
set
out
the
*NL*
same
evening
,
he
had
done
so
,
packing
everything
but
the
dress
suit
.
The
*NL*
shirt
worn
since
the
morning
was
crumpled
and
out
of
the
question
with
*NL*
the
fashionable
open
waistcoat
.
It
was
a
long
way
to
send
to
the
*NL*
Shtcherbatskys
'
.
They
sent
out
to
buy
a
shirt
.
The
servant
came
back
;
*NL*
everything
was
shut
up
--
it
was
Sunday
.
They
sent
to
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
and
brought
a
shirt
--
it
was
impossibly
wide
and
short
.
*NL*
They
sent
finally
to
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
to
unpack
the
things
.
The
*NL*
bridegroom
was
expected
at
the
church
while
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
*NL*
his
room
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
,
peeping
out
into
the
corridor
,
and
*NL*
with
horror
and
despair
recalling
what
absurd
things
he
had
said
to
*NL*
Kitty
and
what
she
might
be
thinking
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
guilty
Kouzma
flew
panting
into
the
room
with
the
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
just
in
time
.
They
were
just
lifting
it
into
the
van
,
''
said
*NL*
Kouzma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
minutes
later
Levin
ran
full
speed
into
the
corridor
,
not
looking
*NL*
at
his
watch
for
fear
of
aggravating
his
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
help
matters
like
this
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
hurrying
with
more
deliberation
after
him
.
``
It
will
come
round
,
*NL*
it
will
come
round
...
I
tell
you
.

``
They
've
come

''
``
Here
he
is
!
''
``
Which
one
?
''
``
Rather
young
,
eh
?
''
``
Why
,
my
*NL*
dear
soul
,
she
looks
more
dead
than
alive
!
''
were
the
comments
in
the
*NL*
crowd
,
when
Levin
,
meeting
his
bride
in
the
entrance
,
walked
with
her
*NL*
into
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
told
his
wife
the
cause
of
the
delay
,
and
the
guests
*NL*
were
whispering
it
with
smiles
to
one
another
.
Levin
saw
nothing
and
no
*NL*
one
;
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
said
she
had
lost
her
looks
dreadfully
of
late
,
and
was
not
*NL*
nearly
so
pretty
on
her
wedding
day
as
usual
;
but
Levin
did
not
think
*NL*
so
.
He
looked
at
her
hair
done
up
high
,
with
the
long
white
veil
and
*NL*
white
flowers
and
the
high
,
stand-up
,
scalloped
collar
,
that
in
such
a
*NL*
maidenly
fashion
hid
her
long
neck
at
the
sides
and
only
showed
it
in
*NL*
front
,
her
strikingly
slender
figure
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
*NL*
looked
better
than
ever
--
not
because
these
flowers
,
this
veil
,
this
gown
*NL*
from
Paris
added
anything
to
her
beauty
;
but
because
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
elaborate
sumptuousness
of
her
attire
,
the
expression
of
her
sweet
face
,
*NL*
of
her
eyes
,
of
her
lips
was
still
her
own
characteristic
expression
of
*NL*
guileless
truthfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
beginning
to
think
you
meant
to
run
away
,
''
she
said
,
and
smiled
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
stupid
,
what
happened
to
me
,
I
'm
ashamed
to
speak
of
it
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
reddening
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
*NL*
came
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
pretty
story
of
yours
about
the
shirt
!
''
said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
shaking
his
head
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
!
''
answered
Levin
,
without
an
idea
of
what
they
were
talking
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Kostya
,
you
have
to
decide
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
an
air
*NL*
of
mock
dismay
,
``
a
weighty
question
.
You
are
at
this
moment
just
in
the
*NL*
humor
to
appreciate
all
its
gravity
.
They
ask
me
,
are
they
to
light
the
*NL*
candles
that
have
been
lighted
before
or
candles
that
have
never
been
*NL*
lighted
?
It
's
a
matter
of
ten
roubles
,
''
he
added
,
relaxing
his
lips
into
*NL*
a
smile
.
``
I
have
decided
,
but
I
was
afraid
you
might
not
agree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
saw
it
was
a
joke
,
but
he
could
not
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
's
it
to
be
then
?
--
unlighted
or
lighted
candles
?
that
's
the
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
unlighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
very
glad
.
The
question
's
decided

''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
How
silly
men
are
,
though
,
in
this
position
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Tchirikov
,
when
Levin
,
after
looking
absently
at
him
,
had
moved
back
to
*NL*
his
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
,
mind
you
're
the
first
to
step
on
the
carpet
,
''
said
Countess
*NL*
Nordston
,
coming
up
.
``
You
're
a
nice
person
!
''
she
said
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
frightened
,
eh
?
''
said
Marya
Dmitrievna
,
an
old
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
cold
?
You
're
pale
.
Stop
a
minute
,
stoop
down
,
''
said
Kitty
's
*NL*
sister
,
Madame
Lvova
,
and
with
her
plump
,
handsome
arms
she
smilingly
*NL*
set
straight
the
flowers
on
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
came
up
,
tried
to
say
something
,
but
could
not
speak
,
cried
,
and
*NL*
then
laughed
unnaturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
looked
at
all
of
them
with
the
same
absent
eyes
as
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
officiating
clergy
had
got
into
their
vestments
,
and
the
*NL*
priest
and
deacon
came
out
to
the
lectern
,
which
stood
in
the
forepart
*NL*
of
the
church
.
The
priest
turned
to
Levin
saying
something
.
Levin
did
*NL*
not
hear
what
the
priest
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
bride
's
hand
and
lead
her
up
,
''
the
best
man
said
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
while
before
Levin
could
make
out
what
was
expected
of
*NL*
him
.
For
a
long
time
they
tried
to
set
him
right
and
made
him
begin
*NL*
again
--
because
he
kept
taking
Kitty
by
the
wrong
arm
or
with
the
wrong
*NL*
arm
--
till
he
understood
at
last
that
what
he
had
to
do
was
,
without
*NL*
changing
his
position
,
to
take
her
right
hand
in
his
right
hand
.
When
at
*NL*
last
he
had
taken
the
bride
's
hand
in
the
correct
way
,
the
priest
walked
*NL*
a
few
paces
in
front
of
them
and
stopped
at
the
lectern
.
The
crowd
of
*NL*
friends
and
relations
moved
after
them
,
with
a
buzz
of
talk
and
a
rustle
*NL*
of
skirts
.
Someone
stooped
down
and
pulled
out
the
bride
's
train
.
The
*NL*
church
became
so
still
that
the
drops
of
wax
could
be
heard
falling
from
*NL*
the
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
old
priest
in
his
ecclesiastical
cap
,
with
his
long
*NL*
silvery-gray
locks
of
hair
parted
behind
his
ears
,
was
fumbling
with
*NL*
something
at
the
lectern
,
putting
out
his
little
old
hands
from
under
*NL*
the
heavy
silver
vestment
with
the
gold
cross
on
the
back
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
approached
him
cautiously
,
whispered
something
,
and
*NL*
making
a
sign
to
Levin
,
walked
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
lighted
two
candles
,
wreathed
with
flowers
,
and
holding
them
*NL*
sideways
so
that
the
wax
dropped
slowly
from
them
he
turned
,
facing
the
*NL*
bridal
pair
.
The
priest
was
the
same
old
man
that
had
confessed
Levin
.
*NL*
He
looked
with
weary
and
melancholy
eyes
at
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
*NL*
sighed
,
and
putting
his
right
hand
out
from
his
vestment
,
blessed
the
*NL*
bridegroom
with
it
,
and
also
with
a
shade
of
solicitous
tenderness
laid
*NL*
the
crossed
fingers
on
the
bowed
head
of
Kitty
.
Then
he
gave
them
the
*NL*
candles
,
and
taking
the
censer
,
moved
slowly
away
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
be
true
?
''
thought
Levin
,
and
he
looked
round
at
his
bride
.
*NL*
Looking
down
at
her
he
saw
her
face
in
profile
,
and
from
the
scarcely
*NL*
perceptible
quiver
of
her
lips
and
eyelashes
he
knew
she
was
aware
of
*NL*
his
eyes
upon
her
.
She
did
not
look
round
,
but
the
high
scalloped
*NL*
collar
,
that
reached
her
little
pink
ear
,
trembled
faintly
.
He
saw
that
*NL*
a
sigh
was
held
back
in
her
throat
,
and
the
little
hand
in
the
long
*NL*
glove
shook
as
it
held
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
fuss
of
the
shirt
,
of
being
late
,
all
the
talk
of
friends
and
*NL*
relations
,
their
annoyance
,
his
ludicrous
position
--
all
suddenly
passed
*NL*
away
and
he
was
filled
with
joy
and
dread
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
,
stately
head-deacon
wearing
a
silver
robe
and
his
curly
*NL*
locks
standing
out
at
each
side
of
his
head
,
stepped
smartly
forward
,
*NL*
and
lifting
his
stole
on
two
fingers
,
stood
opposite
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
be
the
name
of
the
Lord
,
''
the
solemn
syllables
rang
out
slowly
*NL*
one
after
another
,
setting
the
air
quivering
with
waves
of
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed
is
the
name
of
our
God
,
from
the
beginning
,
is
now
,
and
ever
*NL*
shall
be
,
''
the
little
old
priest
answered
in
a
submissive
,
piping
voice
,
*NL*
still
fingering
something
at
the
lectern
.
And
the
full
chorus
of
the
*NL*
unseen
choir
rose
up
,
filling
the
whole
church
,
from
the
windows
to
the
*NL*
vaulted
roof
,
with
broad
waves
of
melody
.
It
grew
stronger
,
rested
for
*NL*
an
instant
,
and
slowly
died
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
prayed
,
as
they
always
do
,
for
peace
from
on
high
and
for
*NL*
salvation
,
for
the
Holy
Synod
,
and
for
the
Tsar
;
they
prayed
,
too
,
for
*NL*
the
servants
of
God
,
Konstantin
and
Ekaterina
,
now
plighting
their
*NL*
troth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vouchsafe
to
them
love
made
perfect
,
peace
and
help
,
O
Lord
,
we
beseech
*NL*
Thee
,
''
the
whole
church
seemed
to
breathe
with
the
voice
of
the
head
*NL*
deacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
heard
the
words
,
and
they
impressed
him
.
``
How
did
they
guess
that
*NL*
it
is
help
,
just
help
that
one
wants
?
''
he
thought
,
recalling
all
his
*NL*
fears
and
doubts
of
late
.
``
What
do
I
know
?
what
can
I
do
in
this
fearful
*NL*
business
,
''
he
thought
,
``
without
help
?
Yes
,
it
is
help
I
want
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
deacon
had
finished
the
prayer
for
the
Imperial
family
,
the
*NL*
priest
turned
to
the
bridal
pair
with
a
book
:
``
Eternal
God
,
that
joinest
*NL*
together
in
love
them
that
were
separate
,
''
he
read
in
a
gentle
,
piping
*NL*
voice
:
``
who
hast
ordained
the
union
of
holy
wedlock
that
can
not
be
set
*NL*
asunder
,
Thou
who
didst
bless
Isaac
and
Rebecca
and
their
descendants
,
*NL*
according
to
Thy
Holy
Covenant
;
bless
Thy
servants
,
Konstantin
and
*NL*
Ekaterina
,
leading
them
in
the
path
of
all
good
works
.
For
gracious
and
*NL*
merciful
art
Thou
,
our
Lord
,
and
glory
be
to
Thee
,
the
Father
,
the
Son
,
*NL*
and
the
Holy
Ghost
,
now
and
ever
shall
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
!
''
the
unseen
choir
sent
rolling
again
upon
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Joinest
together
in
love
them
that
were
separate
.
'
What
deep
meaning
*NL*
in
those
words
,
and
how
they
correspond
with
what
one
feels
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
''
thought
Levin
.
``
Is
she
feeling
the
same
as
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
looking
round
,
he
met
her
eyes
,
and
from
their
expression
he
*NL*
concluded
that
she
was
understanding
it
just
as
he
was
.
But
this
was
a
*NL*
mistake
;
she
almost
completely
missed
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
*NL*
service
;
she
had
not
heard
them
,
in
fact
.
She
could
not
listen
to
them
*NL*
and
take
them
in
,
so
strong
was
the
one
feeling
that
filled
her
breast
*NL*
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger
.
That
feeling
was
joy
at
the
completion
*NL*
of
the
process
that
for
the
last
month
and
a
half
had
been
going
on
in
*NL*
her
soul
,
and
had
during
those
six
weeks
been
a
joy
and
a
torture
to
*NL*
her
.
On
the
day
when
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
house
in
Arbaty
Street
*NL*
she
had
gone
up
to
him
in
her
brown
dress
,
and
given
herself
to
him
*NL*
without
a
word
--
on
that
day
,
at
that
hour
,
there
took
place
in
her
heart
*NL*
a
complete
severance
from
all
her
old
life
,
and
a
quite
different
,
new
,
*NL*
utterly
strange
life
had
begun
for
her
,
while
the
old
life
was
actually
*NL*
going
on
as
before
.
Those
six
weeks
had
for
her
been
a
time
of
the
*NL*
utmost
bliss
and
the
utmost
misery
.
All
her
life
,
all
her
desires
and
*NL*
hopes
were
concentrated
on
this
one
man
,
still
uncomprehended
by
her
,
to
*NL*
whom
she
was
bound
by
a
feeling
of
alternate
attraction
and
repulsion
,
*NL*
even
less
comprehended
than
the
man
himself
,
and
all
the
while
she
was
*NL*
going
on
living
in
the
outward
conditions
of
her
old
life
.
Living
the
*NL*
old
life
,
she
was
horrified
at
herself
,
at
her
utter
insurmountable
*NL*
callousness
to
all
her
own
past
,
to
things
,
to
habits
,
to
the
people
she
*NL*
had
loved
,
who
loved
her
--
to
her
mother
,
who
was
wounded
by
her
*NL*
indifference
,
to
her
kind
,
tender
father
,
till
then
dearer
than
all
the
*NL*
world
.
At
one
moment
she
was
horrified
at
this
indifference
,
at
another
*NL*
she
rejoiced
at
what
had
brought
her
to
this
indifference
.
She
could
not
*NL*
frame
a
thought
,
not
a
wish
apart
from
life
with
this
man
;
but
this
new
*NL*
life
was
not
yet
,
and
she
could
not
even
picture
it
clearly
to
herself
.
*NL*
There
was
only
anticipation
,
the
dread
and
joy
of
the
new
and
the
*NL*
unknown
.
And
now
behold
--
anticipation
and
uncertainty
and
remorse
at
the
*NL*
abandonment
of
the
old
life
--
all
was
ending
,
and
the
new
was
beginning
.
*NL*
This
new
life
could
not
but
have
terrors
for
her
inexperience
;
but
,
*NL*
terrible
or
not
,
the
change
had
been
wrought
six
weeks
before
in
her
*NL*
soul
,
and
this
was
merely
the
final
sanction
of
what
had
long
been
*NL*
completed
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
again
to
the
lectern
,
the
priest
with
some
difficulty
took
*NL*
Kitty
's
little
ring
,
and
asking
Levin
for
his
hand
,
put
it
on
the
first
*NL*
joint
of
his
finger
.
``
The
servant
of
God
,
Konstantin
,
plights
his
troth
*NL*
to
the
servant
of
God
,
Ekaterina
.
''
And
putting
his
big
ring
on
Kitty
's
*NL*
touchingly
weak
,
pink
little
finger
,
the
priest
said
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
bridal
pair
tried
several
times
to
understand
what
they
had
to
*NL*
do
,
and
each
time
made
some
mistake
and
were
corrected
by
the
priest
in
*NL*
a
whisper
.
At
last
,
having
duly
performed
the
ceremony
,
having
signed
*NL*
the
rings
with
the
cross
,
the
priest
handed
Kitty
the
big
ring
,
and
*NL*
Levin
the
little
one
.
Again
they
were
puzzled
,
and
passed
the
rings
from
*NL*
hand
to
hand
,
still
without
doing
what
was
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
,
Tchirikov
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
stepped
forward
to
set
them
*NL*
right
.
There
was
an
interval
of
hesitation
,
whispering
,
and
smiles
;
but
*NL*
the
expression
of
solemn
emotion
on
the
faces
of
the
betrothed
pair
did
*NL*
not
change
:
on
the
contrary
,
in
their
perplexity
over
their
hands
they
*NL*
looked
more
grave
and
deeply
moved
than
before
,
and
the
smile
with
which
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
whispered
to
them
that
now
they
would
each
put
on
*NL*
their
own
ring
died
away
on
his
lips
.
He
had
a
feeling
that
any
smile
*NL*
would
jar
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
who
didst
from
the
beginning
create
male
and
female
,
''
the
priest
*NL*
read
after
the
exchange
of
rings
,
``
from
Thee
woman
was
given
to
man
to
*NL*
be
a
helpmeet
to
him
,
and
for
the
procreation
of
children
.
O
Lord
,
our
*NL*
God
,
who
hast
poured
down
the
blessings
of
Thy
Truth
according
to
Thy
*NL*
Holy
Covenant
upon
Thy
chosen
servants
,
our
fathers
,
from
generation
to
*NL*
generation
,
bless
Thy
servants
Konstantin
and
Ekaterina
,
and
make
their
*NL*
troth
fast
in
faith
,
and
union
of
hearts
,
and
truth
,
and
love
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
more
and
more
that
all
his
ideas
of
marriage
,
all
his
dreams
*NL*
of
how
he
would
order
his
life
,
were
mere
childishness
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
something
he
had
not
understood
hitherto
,
and
now
understood
less
than
*NL*
ever
,
though
it
was
being
performed
upon
him
.
The
lump
in
his
throat
*NL*
rose
higher
and
higher
,
tears
that
would
not
be
checked
came
into
his
*NL*
eyes
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
church
there
was
all
Moscow
,
all
the
friends
and
relations
;
and
*NL*
during
the
ceremony
of
plighting
troth
,
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
*NL*
church
,
there
was
an
incessant
flow
of
discreetly
subdued
talk
in
the
*NL*
circle
of
gaily
dressed
women
and
girls
,
and
men
in
white
ties
,
*NL*
frockcoats
,
and
uniforms
.
The
talk
was
principally
kept
up
by
the
men
,
*NL*
while
the
women
were
absorbed
in
watching
every
detail
of
the
ceremony
,
*NL*
which
always
means
so
much
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
little
group
nearest
to
the
bride
were
her
two
sisters
:
Dolly
,
*NL*
and
the
other
one
,
the
self-possessed
beauty
,
Madame
Lvova
,
who
had
just
*NL*
arrived
from
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
Marie
's
in
lilac
,
as
bad
as
black
,
at
a
wedding
?
''
said
Madame
*NL*
Korsunskaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
her
complexion
,
it
's
the
one
salvation
,
''
responded
Madame
*NL*
Trubetskaya
.
``
I
wonder
why
they
had
the
wedding
in
the
evening
?
It
's
*NL*
like
shop-people
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
prettier
.
I
was
married
in
the
evening
too
...
''
answered
Madame
*NL*
Korsunskaya
,
and
she
sighed
,
remembering
how
charming
she
had
been
that
*NL*
day
,
and
how
absurdly
in
love
her
husband
was
,
and
how
different
it
all
*NL*
was
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
if
anyone
's
best
man
more
than
ten
times
,
he
'll
never
be
*NL*
married
.
I
wanted
to
be
for
the
tenth
time
,
but
the
post
was
taken
,
''
*NL*
said
Count
Siniavin
to
the
pretty
Princess
Tcharskaya
,
who
had
designs
*NL*
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Tcharskaya
only
answered
with
a
smile
.
She
looked
at
Kitty
,
*NL*
thinking
how
and
when
she
would
stand
with
Count
Siniavin
in
Kitty
's
*NL*
place
,
and
how
she
would
remind
him
then
of
his
joke
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
told
the
old
maid
of
honor
,
Madame
Nikolaeva
,
that
he
*NL*
meant
to
put
the
crown
on
Kitty
's
chignon
for
luck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
not
to
have
worn
a
chignon
,
''
answered
Madame
Nikolaeva
,
who
*NL*
had
long
ago
made
up
her
mind
that
if
the
elderly
widower
she
was
*NL*
angling
for
married
her
,
the
wedding
should
be
of
the
simplest
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
such
grandeur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
talking
to
Darya
Dmitrievna
,
jestingly
assuring
*NL*
her
that
the
custom
of
going
away
after
the
wedding
was
becoming
common
*NL*
because
newly
married
people
always
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother
may
feel
proud
of
himself
.
She
's
a
marvel
of
sweetness
.
I

you
're
envious

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
got
over
that
,
Darya
Dmitrievna
,
''
he
answered
,
and
a
*NL*
melancholy
and
serious
expression
suddenly
came
over
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
telling
his
sister-in-law
his
joke
about
*NL*
divorce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wreath
wants
setting
straight
,
''
she
answered
,
not
hearing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
she
's
lost
her
looks
so
,
''
Countess
Nordston
said
to
Madame
*NL*
Lvova
.
``
Still
he
's
not
worth
her
little
finger
,
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
him
so
--
not
because
he
's
my
future
_
beau-frere
_
,
''
answered
*NL*
Madame
Lvova
.
``
And
how
well
he
's
behaving
!
It
's
so
difficult
,
too
,
to
*NL*
look
well
in
such
a
position
,
not
to
be
ridiculous
.
And
he
's
not
*NL*
ridiculous
,
and
not
affected
;
one
can
see
he
's
moved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
expected
it
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Almost
.
She
always
cared
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
shall
see
which
of
them
will
step
on
the
rug
first
.
I
warned
*NL*
Kitty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
make
no
difference
,
''
said
Madame
Lvova
;
``
we
're
all
obedient
*NL*
wives
;
it
's
in
our
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
stepped
on
the
rug
before
Vassily
on
purpose
.
And
you
,
Dolly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
stood
beside
them
;
she
heard
them
,
but
she
did
not
answer
.
She
was
*NL*
deeply
moved
.
The
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
could
not
have
spoken
*NL*
without
crying
.
She
was
rejoicing
over
Kitty
and
Levin
;
going
back
in
*NL*
thought
to
her
own
wedding
,
she
glanced
at
the
radiant
figure
of
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
forgot
all
the
present
,
and
remembered
only
her
own
*NL*
innocent
love
.
She
recalled
not
herself
only
,
but
all
her
women-friends
*NL*
and
acquaintances
.
She
thought
of
them
on
the
one
day
of
their
triumph
,
*NL*
when
they
had
stood
like
Kitty
under
the
wedding
crown
,
with
love
and
*NL*
hope
and
dread
in
their
hearts
,
renouncing
the
past
,
and
stepping
*NL*
forward
into
the
mysterious
future
.
Among
the
brides
that
came
back
to
*NL*
her
memory
,
she
thought
too
of
her
darling
Anna
,
of
whose
proposed
*NL*
divorce
she
had
just
been
hearing
.
And
she
had
stood
just
as
innocent
in
*NL*
orange
flowers
and
bridal
veil
.
And
now
?
``
It
's
terribly
strange
,
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
.
It
was
not
merely
the
sisters
,
the
women-friends
and
*NL*
female
relations
of
the
bride
who
were
following
every
detail
of
the
*NL*
ceremony
.
Women
who
were
quite
strangers
,
mere
spectators
,
were
watching
*NL*
it
excitedly
,
holding
their
breath
,
in
fear
of
losing
a
single
movement
*NL*
or
expression
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
and
angrily
not
answering
,
*NL*
often
not
hearing
,
the
remarks
of
the
callous
men
,
who
kept
making
*NL*
joking
or
irrelevant
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
has
she
been
crying
?
Is
she
being
married
against
her
will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Against
her
will
to
a
fine
fellow
like
that
?
A
prince
,
is
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
her
sister
in
the
white
satin
?
Just
listen
how
the
deacon
booms
*NL*
out
,

And
fearing
her
husband

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
the
choristers
from
Tchudovo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
from
the
Synod

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
the
footman

He
says
he
's
going
to
take
her
home
to
his
country

place
at
once

Awfully
rich
,
they
say
.
That
's
why
she
's
being
married
to
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

they
're
a
well-matched
pair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Marya
Vassilievna
,
you
were
making
out
those
fly-away
crinolines

were
not

Just
look
at
her
in
the
puce
dress
--
an
ambassador
's
*NL*
wife
they
say
she
is

how
her
skirt
bounces
out
from
side
to
side
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pretty
dear
the
bride
is

decked
with
flowers

Well

*NL*
say
what
you
will
,
we
women
feel
for
our
sister

''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
comments
in
the
crowd
of
gazing
women
who
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
slipping
in
at
the
church
doors
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ceremony
of
plighting
troth
was
over
,
the
beadle
spread
before
*NL*
the
lectern
in
the
middle
of
the
church
a
piece
of
pink
silken
stuff
,
*NL*
the
choir
sang
a
complicated
and
elaborate
psalm
,
in
which
the
bass
and
*NL*
tenor
sang
responses
to
one
another
,
and
the
priest
turning
round
*NL*
pointed
the
bridal
pair
to
the
pink
silk
rug
.
Though
both
had
often
*NL*
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
saying
that
the
one
who
steps
first
on
the
*NL*
rug
will
be
the
head
of
the
house
,
neither
Levin
nor
Kitty
were
capable
*NL*
of
recollecting
it
,
as
they
took
the
few
steps
towards
it
.
They
did
not
*NL*
hear
the
loud
remarks
and
disputes
that
followed
,
some
maintaining
he
*NL*
had
stepped
on
first
,
and
others
that
both
had
stepped
on
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
customary
questions
,
whether
they
desired
to
enter
upon
*NL*
matrimony
,
and
whether
they
were
pledged
to
anyone
else
,
and
their
*NL*
answers
,
which
sounded
strange
to
themselves
,
a
new
ceremony
began
.
*NL*
Kitty
listened
to
the
words
of
the
prayer
,
trying
to
make
out
their
*NL*
meaning
,
but
she
could
not
.
The
feeling
of
triumph
and
radiant
happiness
*NL*
flooded
her
soul
more
and
more
as
the
ceremony
went
on
,
and
deprived
her
*NL*
of
all
power
of
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
prayed
:
``
Endow
them
with
continence
and
fruitfulness
,
and
vouchsafe
*NL*
that
their
hearts
may
rejoice
looking
upon
their
sons
and
daughters
.
''
*NL*
They
alluded
to
God
's
creation
of
a
wife
from
Adam
's
rib
``
and
for
this
*NL*
cause
a
man
shall
leave
father
and
mother
,
and
cleave
unto
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
they
two
shall
be
one
flesh
,
''
and
that
``
this
is
a
great
mystery
''
;
they
*NL*
prayed
that
God
would
make
them
fruitful
and
bless
them
,
like
Isaac
and
*NL*
Rebecca
,
Joseph
,
Moses
and
Zipporah
,
and
that
they
might
look
upon
their
*NL*
children
's
children
.
``
That
's
all
splendid
,
''
thought
Kitty
,
catching
the
*NL*
words
,
``
all
that
's
just
as
it
should
be
,
''
and
a
smile
of
happiness
,
*NL*
unconsciously
reflected
in
everyone
who
looked
at
her
,
beamed
on
her
*NL*
radiant
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
it
on
quite
,
''
voices
were
heard
urging
when
the
priest
had
put
on
*NL*
the
wedding
crowns
and
Shtcherbatsky
,
his
hand
shaking
in
its
*NL*
three-button
glove
,
held
the
crown
high
above
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
it
on
!
''
she
whispered
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
round
at
her
,
and
was
struck
by
the
joyful
radiance
on
her
*NL*
face
,
and
unconsciously
her
feeling
infected
him
.
He
too
,
like
her
felt
*NL*
glad
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
enjoyed
hearing
the
epistle
read
,
and
the
roll
of
the
head
deacon
's
*NL*
voice
at
the
last
verse
,
awaited
with
such
impatience
by
the
outside
*NL*
public
.
They
enjoyed
drinking
out
of
the
shallow
cup
of
warm
red
wine
*NL*
and
water
,
and
they
were
still
more
pleased
when
the
priest
,
flinging
*NL*
back
his
stole
and
taking
both
their
hands
in
his
,
led
them
round
the
*NL*
lectern
to
the
accompaniment
of
bass
voices
chanting
``
Glory
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shtcherbatsky
and
Tchirikov
,
supporting
the
crowns
and
stumbling
over
*NL*
the
bride
's
train
,
smiling
too
and
seeming
delighted
at
something
,
were
*NL*
at
one
moment
left
behind
,
at
the
next
treading
on
the
bridal
pair
as
*NL*
the
priest
came
to
a
halt
.
The
spark
of
joy
kindled
in
Kitty
seemed
to
*NL*
have
infected
everyone
in
the
church
.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
the
priest
*NL*
and
the
deacon
too
wanted
to
smile
just
as
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
crowns
off
their
heads
the
priest
read
the
last
prayer
and
*NL*
congratulated
the
young
people
.
Levin
looked
at
Kitty
,
and
he
had
never
*NL*
before
seen
her
look
as
she
did
.
She
was
charming
with
the
new
radiance
*NL*
of
happiness
in
her
face
.
Levin
longed
to
say
something
to
her
,
but
he
*NL*
did
not
know
whether
it
was
all
over
.
The
priest
got
him
out
of
his
*NL*
difficulty
.
He
smiled
his
kindly
smile
and
said
gently
,
``
Kiss
your
wife
,
*NL*
and
you
kiss
your
husband
,
''
and
took
the
candles
out
of
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
kissed
her
smiling
lips
with
timid
care
,
gave
her
his
arm
,
and
*NL*
with
a
new
strange
sense
of
closeness
,
walked
out
of
the
church
.
He
did
*NL*
not
believe
,
he
could
not
believe
,
that
it
was
true
.
It
was
only
when
*NL*
their
wondering
and
timid
eyes
met
that
he
believed
in
it
,
because
he
*NL*
felt
that
they
were
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
,
the
same
night
,
the
young
people
left
for
the
country

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
and
Anna
had
been
traveling
for
three
months
together
in
Europe
.
*NL*
They
had
visited
Venice
,
Rome
,
and
Naples
,
and
had
just
arrived
at
a
*NL*
small
Italian
town
where
they
meant
to
stay
some
time
.
A
handsome
head
*NL*
waiter
,
with
thick
pomaded
hair
parted
from
the
neck
upwards
,
an
evening
*NL*
coat
,
a
broad
white
cambric
shirt
front
,
and
a
bunch
of
trinkets
hanging
*NL*
above
his
rounded
stomach
,
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
full
curve
of
his
*NL*
pockets
,
looking
contemptuously
from
under
his
eyelids
while
he
gave
*NL*
some
frigid
reply
to
a
gentleman
who
had
stopped
him
.
Catching
the
sound
*NL*
of
footsteps
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
entry
towards
the
*NL*
staircase
,
the
head
waiter
turned
round
,
and
seeing
the
Russian
count
,
*NL*
who
had
taken
their
best
rooms
,
he
took
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
*NL*
deferentially
,
and
with
a
bow
informed
him
that
a
courier
had
been
,
and
*NL*
that
the
business
about
the
palazzo
had
been
arranged
.
The
steward
was
*NL*
prepared
to
sign
the
agreement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
Is
madame
at
home
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
has
been
out
for
a
walk
but
has
returned
now
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
took
off
his
soft
,
wide-brimmed
hat
and
passed
his
handkerchief
*NL*
over
his
heated
brow
and
hair
,
which
had
grown
half
over
his
ears
,
and
*NL*
was
brushed
back
covering
the
bald
patch
on
his
head
.
And
glancing
*NL*
casually
at
the
gentleman
,
who
still
stood
there
gazing
intently
at
him
,
*NL*
he
would
have
gone
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
gentleman
is
a
Russian
,
and
was
inquiring
after
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
head
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
mingled
feelings
of
annoyance
at
never
being
able
to
get
away
from
*NL*
acquaintances
anywhere
,
and
longing
to
find
some
sort
of
diversion
from
*NL*
the
monotony
of
his
life
,
Vronsky
looked
once
more
at
the
gentleman
,
who
*NL*
had
retreated
and
stood
still
again
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
light
came
*NL*
into
the
eyes
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Golenishtchev
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vronsky
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
really
was
Golenishtchev
,
a
comrade
of
Vronsky
's
in
the
Corps
of
*NL*
Pages
.
In
the
corps
Golenishtchev
had
belonged
to
the
liberal
party
;
he
*NL*
left
the
corps
without
entering
the
army
,
and
had
never
taken
office
*NL*
under
the
government
.
Vronsky
and
he
had
gone
completely
different
ways
*NL*
on
leaving
the
corps
,
and
had
only
met
once
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
meeting
Vronsky
perceived
that
Golenishtchev
had
taken
up
a
sort
*NL*
of
lofty
,
intellectually
liberal
line
,
and
was
consequently
disposed
to
*NL*
look
down
upon
Vronsky
's
interests
and
calling
in
life
.
Hence
Vronsky
*NL*
had
met
him
with
the
chilling
and
haughty
manner
he
so
well
knew
how
to
*NL*
assume
,
the
meaning
of
which
was
:
``
You
may
like
or
dislike
my
way
of
*NL*
life
,
that
's
a
matter
of
the
most
perfect
indifference
to
me
;
you
will
*NL*
have
to
treat
me
with
respect
if
you
want
to
know
me
.
''
Golenishtchev
had
*NL*
been
contemptuously
indifferent
to
the
tone
taken
by
Vronsky
.
This
*NL*
second
meeting
might
have
been
expected
,
one
would
have
supposed
,
to
*NL*
estrange
them
still
more
.
But
now
they
beamed
and
exclaimed
with
delight
*NL*
on
recognizing
one
another
.
Vronsky
would
never
have
expected
to
be
so
*NL*
pleased
to
see
Golenishtchev
,
but
probably
he
was
not
himself
aware
how
*NL*
bored
he
was
.
He
forgot
the
disagreeable
impression
of
their
last
*NL*
meeting
,
and
with
a
face
of
frank
delight
held
out
his
hand
to
his
old
*NL*
comrade
.
The
same
expression
of
delight
replaced
the
look
of
uneasiness
*NL*
on
Golenishtchev
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
to
meet
you
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
showing
his
strong
white
*NL*
teeth
in
a
friendly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
the
name
Vronsky
,
but
I
did
n't
know
which
one
.
I
'm
very
,
very
*NL*
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
in
.
Come
,
tell
me
what
you
're
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
living
here
for
two
years
.
I
'm
working
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
with
sympathy
;
``
let
's
go
in
.
''
And
with
the
habit
*NL*
common
with
Russians
,
instead
of
saying
in
Russian
what
he
wanted
to
*NL*
keep
from
the
servants
,
he
began
to
speak
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Madame
Karenina
?
We
are
traveling
together
.
I
am
going
to
*NL*
see
her
now
,
''
he
said
in
French
,
carefully
scrutinizing
Golenishtchev
's
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
did
not
know
''
-LRB-
though
he
did
know
-RRB-
,
Golenishtchev
answered
*NL*
carelessly
.
``
Have
you
been
here
long
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
days
,
''
Vronsky
answered
,
once
more
scrutinizing
his
friend
's
face
*NL*
intently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
a
decent
fellow
,
and
will
look
at
the
thing
properly
,
''
*NL*
Vronsky
said
to
himself
,
catching
the
significance
of
Golenishtchev
's
*NL*
face
and
the
change
of
subject
.
``
I
can
introduce
him
to
Anna
,
he
looks
*NL*
at
it
properly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
those
three
months
that
Vronsky
had
spent
abroad
with
Anna
,
he
*NL*
had
always
on
meeting
new
people
asked
himself
how
the
new
person
would
*NL*
look
at
his
relations
with
Anna
,
and
for
the
most
part
,
in
men
,
he
had
*NL*
met
with
the
``
proper
''
way
of
looking
at
it
.
But
if
he
had
been
asked
,
*NL*
and
those
who
looked
at
it
``
properly
''
had
been
asked
,
exactly
how
they
*NL*
did
look
at
it
,
both
he
and
they
would
have
been
greatly
puzzled
to
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
those
who
in
Vronsky
's
opinion
had
the
``
proper
''
view
had
no
*NL*
sort
of
view
at
all
,
but
behaved
in
general
as
well-bred
persons
do
*NL*
behave
in
regard
to
all
the
complex
and
insoluble
problems
with
which
*NL*
life
is
encompassed
on
all
sides
;
they
behaved
with
propriety
,
avoiding
*NL*
allusions
and
unpleasant
questions
.
They
assumed
an
air
of
fully
*NL*
comprehending
the
import
and
force
of
the
situation
,
of
accepting
and
*NL*
even
approving
of
it
,
but
of
considering
it
superfluous
and
uncalled
for
*NL*
to
put
all
this
into
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
at
once
divined
that
Golenishtchev
was
of
this
class
,
and
*NL*
therefore
was
doubly
pleased
to
see
him
.
And
in
fact
,
Golenishtchev
's
*NL*
manner
to
Madame
Karenina
,
when
he
was
taken
to
call
on
her
,
was
all
*NL*
that
Vronsky
could
have
desired
.
Obviously
without
the
slightest
effort
*NL*
he
steered
clear
of
all
subjects
which
might
lead
to
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
never
met
Anna
before
,
and
was
struck
by
her
beauty
,
and
still
*NL*
more
by
the
frankness
with
which
she
accepted
her
position
.
She
blushed
*NL*
when
Vronsky
brought
in
Golenishtchev
,
and
he
was
extremely
charmed
by
*NL*
this
childish
blush
overspreading
her
candid
and
handsome
face
.
But
what
*NL*
he
liked
particularly
was
the
way
in
which
at
once
,
as
though
on
purpose
*NL*
that
there
might
be
no
misunderstanding
with
an
outsider
,
she
called
*NL*
Vronsky
simply
Alexey
,
and
said
they
were
moving
into
a
house
they
had
*NL*
just
taken
,
what
was
here
called
a
palazzo
.
Golenishtchev
liked
this
*NL*
direct
and
simple
attitude
to
her
own
position
.
Looking
at
Anna
's
manner
*NL*
of
simple-hearted
,
spirited
gaiety
,
and
knowing
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
and
Vronsky
,
Golenishtchev
fancied
that
he
understood
her
perfectly
.
He
*NL*
fancied
that
he
understood
what
she
was
utterly
unable
to
understand
:
*NL*
how
it
was
that
,
having
made
her
husband
wretched
,
having
abandoned
him
*NL*
and
her
son
and
lost
her
good
name
,
she
yet
felt
full
of
spirits
,
*NL*
gaiety
,
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
the
guide-book
,
''
said
Golenishtchev
,
referring
to
the
palazzo
*NL*
Vronsky
had
taken
.
``
There
's
a
first-rate
Tintoretto
there
.
One
of
his
*NL*
latest
period
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
:
it
's
a
lovely
day
,
let
's
go
and
have
another
look
at
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
addressing
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
;
I
'll
go
and
put
on
my
hat
.
Would
you
say
it
's
*NL*
hot
?
''
she
said
,
stopping
short
in
the
doorway
and
looking
inquiringly
at
*NL*
Vronsky
.
And
again
a
vivid
flush
overspread
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
saw
from
her
eyes
that
she
did
not
know
on
what
terms
he
cared
*NL*
to
be
with
Golenishtchev
,
and
so
was
afraid
of
not
behaving
as
he
would
*NL*
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
a
long
,
tender
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
very
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
understood
everything
,
most
of
all
,
that
*NL*
he
was
pleased
with
her
;
and
smiling
to
him
,
she
walked
with
her
rapid
*NL*
step
out
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
friends
glanced
at
one
another
,
and
a
look
of
hesitation
came
into
*NL*
both
faces
,
as
though
Golenishtchev
,
unmistakably
admiring
her
,
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
say
something
about
her
,
and
could
not
find
the
right
*NL*
thing
to
say
,
while
Vronsky
desired
and
dreaded
his
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
Vronsky
began
to
start
a
conversation
of
some
sort
;
``
so
*NL*
you
're
settled
here
?
You
're
still
at
the
same
work
,
then
?
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
recalling
that
he
had
been
told
Golenishtchev
was
writing
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
writing
the
second
part
of
the
_
Two
Elements
_
,
''
said
*NL*
Golenishtchev
,
coloring
with
pleasure
at
the
question
--
``
that
is
,
to
be
*NL*
exact
,
I
am
not
writing
it
yet
;
I
am
preparing
,
collecting
materials
.
It
*NL*
will
be
of
far
wider
scope
,
and
will
touch
on
almost
all
questions
.
We
*NL*
in
Russia
refuse
to
see
that
we
are
the
heirs
of
Byzantium
,
''
and
he
*NL*
launched
into
a
long
and
heated
explanation
of
his
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
at
the
first
moment
felt
embarrassed
at
not
even
knowing
of
the
*NL*
first
part
of
the
_
Two
Elements
_
,
of
which
the
author
spoke
as
something
*NL*
well
known
.
But
as
Golenishtchev
began
to
lay
down
his
opinions
and
*NL*
Vronsky
was
able
to
follow
them
even
without
knowing
the
_
Two
Elements
_
,
*NL*
he
listened
to
him
with
some
interest
,
for
Golenishtchev
spoke
well
.
But
*NL*
Vronsky
was
startled
and
annoyed
by
the
nervous
irascibility
with
which
*NL*
Golenishtchev
talked
of
the
subject
that
engrossed
him
.
As
he
went
on
*NL*
talking
,
his
eyes
glittered
more
and
more
angrily
;
he
was
more
and
more
*NL*
hurried
in
his
replies
to
imaginary
opponents
,
and
his
face
grew
more
*NL*
and
more
excited
and
worried
.
Remembering
Golenishtchev
,
a
thin
,
lively
,
*NL*
good-natured
and
well-bred
boy
,
always
at
the
head
of
the
class
,
Vronsky
*NL*
could
not
make
out
the
reason
of
his
irritability
,
and
he
did
not
like
*NL*
it
.
What
he
particularly
disliked
was
that
Golenishtchev
,
a
man
*NL*
belonging
to
a
good
set
,
should
put
himself
on
a
level
with
some
*NL*
scribbling
fellows
,
with
whom
he
was
irritated
and
angry
.
Was
it
worth
*NL*
it
?
Vronsky
disliked
it
,
yet
he
felt
that
Golenishtchev
was
unhappy
,
and
*NL*
was
sorry
for
him
.
Unhappiness
,
almost
mental
derangement
,
was
visible
*NL*
on
his
mobile
,
rather
handsome
face
,
while
without
even
noticing
Anna
's
*NL*
coming
in
,
he
went
on
hurriedly
and
hotly
expressing
his
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anna
came
in
in
her
hat
and
cape
,
and
her
lovely
hand
rapidly
*NL*
swinging
her
parasol
,
and
stood
beside
him
,
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
relief
that
Vronsky
broke
away
from
the
plaintive
eyes
of
Golenishtchev
*NL*
which
fastened
persistently
upon
him
,
and
with
a
fresh
rush
of
love
*NL*
looked
at
his
charming
companion
,
full
of
life
and
happiness
.
*NL*
Golenishtchev
recovered
himself
with
an
effort
,
and
at
first
was
*NL*
dejected
and
gloomy
,
but
Anna
,
disposed
to
feel
friendly
with
everyone
*NL*
as
she
was
at
that
time
,
soon
revived
his
spirits
by
her
direct
and
*NL*
lively
manner
.
After
trying
various
subjects
of
conversation
,
she
got
*NL*
him
upon
painting
,
of
which
he
talked
very
well
,
and
she
listened
to
him
*NL*
attentively
.
They
walked
to
the
house
they
had
taken
,
and
looked
over
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
of
one
thing
,
''
said
Anna
to
Golenishtchev
when
they
were
*NL*
on
their
way
back
,
``
Alexey
will
have
a
capital
_
atelier
_
.
You
must
*NL*
certainly
take
that
room
,
''
she
said
to
Vronsky
in
Russian
,
using
the
*NL*
affectionately
familiar
form
as
though
she
saw
that
Golenishtchev
would
*NL*
become
intimate
with
them
in
their
isolation
,
and
that
there
was
no
need
*NL*
of
reserve
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
paint
?
''
said
Golenishtchev
,
turning
round
quickly
to
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
used
to
study
long
ago
,
and
now
I
have
begun
to
do
a
little
,
''
*NL*
said
Vronsky
,
reddening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
great
talent
,
''
said
Anna
with
a
delighted
smile
.
``
I
'm
no
judge
,
*NL*
of
course
.
But
good
judges
have
said
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
in
that
first
period
of
her
emancipation
and
rapid
return
to
*NL*
health
,
felt
herself
unpardonably
happy
and
full
of
the
joy
of
life
.
The
*NL*
thought
of
her
husband
's
unhappiness
did
not
poison
her
happiness
.
On
*NL*
one
side
that
memory
was
too
awful
to
be
thought
of
.
On
the
other
side
*NL*
her
husband
's
unhappiness
had
given
her
too
much
happiness
to
be
*NL*
regretted
.
The
memory
of
all
that
had
happened
after
her
illness
:
her
*NL*
reconciliation
with
her
husband
,
its
breakdown
,
the
news
of
Vronsky
's
*NL*
wound
,
his
visit
,
the
preparations
for
divorce
,
the
departure
from
her
*NL*
husband
's
house
,
the
parting
from
her
son
--
all
that
seemed
to
her
like
a
*NL*
delirious
dream
,
from
which
she
had
waked
up
alone
with
Vronsky
abroad
.
*NL*
The
thought
of
the
harm
caused
to
her
husband
aroused
in
her
a
feeling
*NL*
like
repulsion
,
and
akin
to
what
a
drowning
man
might
feel
who
has
*NL*
shaken
off
another
man
clinging
to
him
.
That
man
did
drown
.
It
was
an
*NL*
evil
action
,
of
course
,
but
it
was
the
sole
means
of
escape
,
and
better
*NL*
not
to
brood
over
these
fearful
facts
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
consolatory
reflection
upon
her
conduct
had
occurred
to
her
at
the
*NL*
first
moment
of
the
final
rupture
,
and
when
now
she
recalled
all
the
*NL*
past
,
she
remembered
that
one
reflection
.
``
I
have
inevitably
made
that
*NL*
man
wretched
,
''
she
thought
;
``
but
I
do
n't
want
to
profit
by
his
misery
.
I
*NL*
too
am
suffering
,
and
shall
suffer
;
I
am
losing
what
I
prized
above
*NL*
everything
--
I
am
losing
my
good
name
and
my
son
.
I
have
done
wrong
,
and
*NL*
so
I
do
n't
want
happiness
,
I
do
n't
want
a
divorce
,
and
shall
suffer
from
*NL*
my
shame
and
the
separation
from
my
child
.
''
But
,
however
sincerely
Anna
*NL*
had
meant
to
suffer
,
she
was
not
suffering
.
Shame
there
was
not
.
With
*NL*
the
tact
of
which
both
had
such
a
large
share
,
they
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
avoiding
Russian
ladies
abroad
,
and
so
had
never
placed
themselves
in
a
*NL*
false
position
,
and
everywhere
they
had
met
people
who
pretended
that
*NL*
they
perfectly
understood
their
position
,
far
better
indeed
than
they
*NL*
did
themselves
.
Separation
from
the
son
she
loved
--
even
that
did
not
*NL*
cause
her
anguish
in
these
early
days
.
The
baby
girl
--
_
his
_
child
--
was
*NL*
so
sweet
,
and
had
so
won
Anna
's
heart
,
since
she
was
all
that
was
left
*NL*
her
,
that
Anna
rarely
thought
of
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
desire
for
life
,
waxing
stronger
with
recovered
health
,
was
so
*NL*
intense
,
and
the
conditions
of
life
were
so
new
and
pleasant
,
that
Anna
*NL*
felt
unpardonably
happy
.
The
more
she
got
to
know
Vronsky
,
the
more
she
*NL*
loved
him
.
She
loved
him
for
himself
,
and
for
his
love
for
her
.
Her
*NL*
complete
ownership
of
him
was
a
continual
joy
to
her
.
His
presence
was
*NL*
always
sweet
to
her
.
All
the
traits
of
his
character
,
which
she
learned
*NL*
to
know
better
and
better
,
were
unutterably
dear
to
her
.
His
appearance
,
*NL*
changed
by
his
civilian
dress
,
was
as
fascinating
to
her
as
though
she
*NL*
were
some
young
girl
in
love
.
In
everything
he
said
,
thought
,
and
did
,
*NL*
she
saw
something
particularly
noble
and
elevated
.
Her
adoration
of
him
*NL*
alarmed
her
indeed
;
she
sought
and
could
not
find
in
him
anything
not
*NL*
fine
.
She
dared
not
show
him
her
sense
of
her
own
insignificance
beside
*NL*
him
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
,
knowing
this
,
he
might
sooner
cease
to
love
*NL*
her
;
and
she
dreaded
nothing
now
so
much
as
losing
his
love
,
though
she
*NL*
had
no
grounds
for
fearing
it
.
But
she
could
not
help
being
grateful
to
*NL*
him
for
his
attitude
to
her
,
and
showing
that
she
appreciated
it
.
He
,
*NL*
who
had
in
her
opinion
such
a
marked
aptitude
for
a
political
career
,
in
*NL*
which
he
would
have
been
certain
to
play
a
leading
part
--
he
had
*NL*
sacrificed
his
ambition
for
her
sake
,
and
never
betrayed
the
slightest
*NL*
regret
.
He
was
more
lovingly
respectful
to
her
than
ever
,
and
the
*NL*
constant
care
that
she
should
not
feel
the
awkwardness
of
her
position
*NL*
never
deserted
him
for
a
single
instant
.
He
,
so
manly
a
man
,
never
*NL*
opposed
her
,
had
indeed
,
with
her
,
no
will
of
his
own
,
and
was
anxious
,
*NL*
it
seemed
,
for
nothing
but
to
anticipate
her
wishes
.
And
she
could
not
*NL*
but
appreciate
this
,
even
though
the
very
intensity
of
his
solicitude
*NL*
for
her
,
the
atmosphere
of
care
with
which
he
surrounded
her
,
sometimes
*NL*
weighed
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
meanwhile
,
in
spite
of
the
complete
realization
of
what
he
had
*NL*
so
long
desired
,
was
not
perfectly
happy
.
He
soon
felt
that
the
*NL*
realization
of
his
desires
gave
him
no
more
than
a
grain
of
sand
out
of
*NL*
the
mountain
of
happiness
he
had
expected
.
It
showed
him
the
mistake
men
*NL*
make
in
picturing
to
themselves
happiness
as
the
realization
of
their
*NL*
desires
.
For
a
time
after
joining
his
life
to
hers
,
and
putting
on
*NL*
civilian
dress
,
he
had
felt
all
the
delight
of
freedom
in
general
of
*NL*
which
he
had
known
nothing
before
,
and
of
freedom
in
his
love
,
--
and
he
*NL*
was
content
,
but
not
for
long
.
He
was
soon
aware
that
there
was
*NL*
springing
up
in
his
heart
a
desire
for
desires
--
_
ennui
_
.
Without
*NL*
conscious
intention
he
began
to
clutch
at
every
passing
caprice
,
taking
*NL*
it
for
a
desire
and
an
object
.
Sixteen
hours
of
the
day
must
be
occupied
*NL*
in
some
way
,
since
they
were
living
abroad
in
complete
freedom
,
outside
*NL*
the
conditions
of
social
life
which
filled
up
time
in
Petersburg
.
As
for
*NL*
the
amusements
of
bachelor
existence
,
which
had
provided
Vronsky
with
*NL*
entertainment
on
previous
tours
abroad
,
they
could
not
be
thought
of
,
*NL*
since
the
sole
attempt
of
the
sort
had
led
to
a
sudden
attack
of
*NL*
depression
in
Anna
,
quite
out
of
proportion
with
the
cause
--
a
late
*NL*
supper
with
bachelor
friends
.
Relations
with
the
society
of
the
*NL*
place
--
foreign
and
Russian
--
were
equally
out
of
the
question
owing
to
*NL*
the
irregularity
of
their
position
.
The
inspection
of
objects
of
*NL*
interest
,
apart
from
the
fact
that
everything
had
been
seen
already
,
had
*NL*
not
for
Vronsky
,
a
Russian
and
a
sensible
man
,
the
immense
significance
*NL*
Englishmen
are
able
to
attach
to
that
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
just
as
the
hungry
stomach
eagerly
accepts
every
object
it
can
get
,
*NL*
hoping
to
find
nourishment
in
it
,
Vronsky
quite
unconsciously
clutched
*NL*
first
at
politics
,
then
at
new
books
,
and
then
at
pictures
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
from
a
child
a
taste
for
painting
,
and
as
,
not
knowing
what
to
*NL*
spend
his
money
on
,
he
had
begun
collecting
engravings
,
he
came
to
a
*NL*
stop
at
painting
,
began
to
take
interest
in
it
,
and
concentrated
upon
it
*NL*
the
unoccupied
mass
of
desires
which
demanded
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
ready
appreciation
of
art
,
and
probably
,
with
a
taste
for
*NL*
imitating
art
,
he
supposed
himself
to
have
the
real
thing
essential
for
*NL*
an
artist
,
and
after
hesitating
for
some
time
which
style
of
painting
to
*NL*
select
--
religious
,
historical
,
realistic
,
or
genre
painting
--
he
set
to
*NL*
work
to
paint
.
He
appreciated
all
kinds
,
and
could
have
felt
inspired
by
*NL*
any
one
of
them
;
but
he
had
no
conception
of
the
possibility
of
knowing
*NL*
nothing
at
all
of
any
school
of
painting
,
and
of
being
inspired
directly
*NL*
by
what
is
within
the
soul
,
without
caring
whether
what
is
painted
will
*NL*
belong
to
any
recognized
school
.
Since
he
knew
nothing
of
this
,
and
drew
*NL*
his
inspiration
,
not
directly
from
life
,
but
indirectly
from
life
*NL*
embodied
in
art
,
his
inspiration
came
very
quickly
and
easily
,
and
as
*NL*
quickly
and
easily
came
his
success
in
painting
something
very
similar
*NL*
to
the
sort
of
painting
he
was
trying
to
imitate
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
any
other
style
he
liked
the
French
--
graceful
and
*NL*
effective
--
and
in
that
style
he
began
to
paint
Anna
's
portrait
in
*NL*
Italian
costume
,
and
the
portrait
seemed
to
him
,
and
to
everyone
who
saw
*NL*
it
,
extremely
successful
.

The
old
neglected
palazzo
,
with
its
lofty
carved
ceilings
and
frescoes
*NL*
on
the
walls
,
with
its
floors
of
mosaic
,
with
its
heavy
yellow
stuff
*NL*
curtains
on
the
windows
,
with
its
vases
on
pedestals
,
and
its
open
*NL*
fireplaces
,
its
carved
doors
and
gloomy
reception
rooms
,
hung
with
*NL*
pictures
--
this
palazzo
did
much
,
by
its
very
appearance
after
they
had
*NL*
moved
into
it
,
to
confirm
in
Vronsky
the
agreeable
illusion
that
he
was
*NL*
not
so
much
a
Russian
country
gentleman
,
a
retired
army
officer
,
as
an
*NL*
enlightened
amateur
and
patron
of
the
arts
,
himself
a
modest
artist
who
*NL*
had
renounced
the
world
,
his
connections
,
and
his
ambition
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
the
woman
he
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pose
chosen
by
Vronsky
with
their
removal
into
the
palazzo
was
*NL*
completely
successful
,
and
having
,
through
Golenishtchev
,
made
*NL*
acquaintance
with
a
few
interesting
people
,
for
a
time
he
was
satisfied
.
*NL*
He
painted
studies
from
nature
under
the
guidance
of
an
Italian
*NL*
professor
of
painting
,
and
studied
mediaeval
Italian
life
.
Mediaeval
*NL*
Italian
life
so
fascinated
Vronsky
that
he
even
wore
a
hat
and
flung
a
*NL*
cloak
over
his
shoulder
in
the
mediaeval
style
,
which
,
indeed
,
was
*NL*
extremely
becoming
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
live
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
's
going
on
,
''
Vronsky
said
to
*NL*
Golenishtchev
as
he
came
to
see
him
one
morning
.
``
Have
you
seen
*NL*
Mihailov
's
picture
?
''
he
said
,
handing
him
a
Russian
gazette
he
had
*NL*
received
that
morning
,
and
pointing
to
an
article
on
a
Russian
artist
,
*NL*
living
in
the
very
same
town
,
and
just
finishing
a
picture
which
had
*NL*
long
been
talked
about
,
and
had
been
bought
beforehand
.
The
article
*NL*
reproached
the
government
and
the
academy
for
letting
so
remarkable
an
*NL*
artist
be
left
without
encouragement
and
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
it
,
''
answered
Golenishtchev
.
``
Of
course
,
he
's
not
without
*NL*
talent
,
but
it
's
all
in
a
wrong
direction
.
It
's
all
the
*NL*
Ivanov-Strauss-Renan
attitude
to
Christ
and
to
religious
painting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
subject
of
the
picture
?
''
asked
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christ
before
Pilate
.
Christ
is
represented
as
a
Jew
with
all
the
*NL*
realism
of
the
new
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
question
of
the
subject
of
the
picture
having
brought
him
to
one
*NL*
of
his
favorite
theories
,
Golenishtchev
launched
forth
into
a
*NL*
disquisition
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
understand
how
they
can
fall
into
such
a
gross
mistake
.
Christ
*NL*
always
has
His
definite
embodiment
in
the
art
of
the
great
masters
.
And
*NL*
therefore
,
if
they
want
to
depict
,
not
God
,
but
a
revolutionist
or
a
*NL*
sage
,
let
them
take
from
history
a
Socrates
,
a
Franklin
,
a
Charlotte
*NL*
Corday
,
but
not
Christ
.
They
take
the
very
figure
which
can
not
be
taken
*NL*
for
their
art
,
and
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
true
that
this
Mihailov
is
in
such
poverty
?
''
asked
Vronsky
,
*NL*
thinking
that
,
as
a
Russian
Maecenas
,
it
was
his
duty
to
assist
the
*NL*
artist
regardless
of
whether
the
picture
were
good
or
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
not
.
He
's
a
remarkable
portrait-painter
.
Have
you
ever
*NL*
seen
his
portrait
of
Madame
Vassiltchikova
?
But
I
believe
he
does
n't
*NL*
care
about
painting
any
more
portraits
,
and
so
very
likely
he
is
in
*NL*
want
.
I
maintain
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
we
ask
him
to
paint
a
portrait
of
Anna
Arkadyevna
?
''
said
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
mine
?
''
said
Anna
.
``
After
yours
I
do
n't
want
another
portrait
.
*NL*
Better
have
one
of
Annie
''
-LRB-
so
she
called
her
baby
girl
-RRB-
.
``
Here
she
is
,
''
*NL*
she
added
,
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
handsome
Italian
nurse
,
who
*NL*
was
carrying
the
child
out
into
the
garden
,
and
immediately
glancing
*NL*
unnoticed
at
Vronsky
.
The
handsome
nurse
,
from
whom
Vronsky
was
painting
*NL*
a
head
for
his
picture
,
was
the
one
hidden
grief
in
Anna
's
life
.
He
*NL*
painted
with
her
as
his
model
,
admired
her
beauty
and
mediaevalism
,
and
*NL*
Anna
dared
not
confess
to
herself
that
she
was
afraid
of
becoming
*NL*
jealous
of
this
nurse
,
and
was
for
that
reason
particularly
gracious
and
*NL*
condescending
both
to
her
and
her
little
son
.
Vronsky
,
too
,
glanced
out
*NL*
of
the
window
and
into
Anna
's
eyes
,
and
,
turning
at
once
to
*NL*
Golenishtchev
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
this
Mihailov
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
met
him
.
But
he
's
a
queer
fish
,
and
quite
without
breeding
.
You
*NL*
know
,
one
of
those
uncouth
new
people
one
's
so
often
coming
across
*NL*
nowadays
,
one
of
those
free-thinkers
you
know
,
who
are
reared
_
d'emblee
_
*NL*
in
theories
of
atheism
,
scepticism
,
and
materialism
.
In
former
days
,
''
*NL*
said
Golenishtchev
,
not
observing
,
or
not
willing
to
observe
,
that
both
*NL*
Anna
and
Vronsky
wanted
to
speak
,
``
in
former
days
the
free-thinker
was
a
*NL*
man
who
had
been
brought
up
in
ideas
of
religion
,
law
,
and
morality
,
and
*NL*
only
through
conflict
and
struggle
came
to
free-thought
;
but
now
there
*NL*
has
sprung
up
a
new
type
of
born
free-thinkers
who
grow
up
without
even
*NL*
having
heard
of
principles
of
morality
or
of
religion
,
of
the
existence
*NL*
of
authorities
,
who
grow
up
directly
in
ideas
of
negation
in
everything
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
savages
.
Well
,
he
's
of
that
class
.
He
's
the
son
,
it
*NL*
appears
,
of
some
Moscow
butler
,
and
has
never
had
any
sort
of
*NL*
bringing-up
.
When
he
got
into
the
academy
and
made
his
reputation
he
*NL*
tried
,
as
he
's
no
fool
,
to
educate
himself
.
And
he
turned
to
what
seemed
*NL*
to
him
the
very
source
of
culture
--
the
magazines
.
In
old
times
,
you
see
,
*NL*
a
man
who
wanted
to
educate
himself
--
a
Frenchman
,
for
instance
--
would
*NL*
have
set
to
work
to
study
all
the
classics
and
theologians
and
*NL*
tragedians
and
historiaris
and
philosophers
,
and
,
you
know
,
all
the
*NL*
intellectual
work
that
came
in
his
way
.
But
in
our
day
he
goes
straight
*NL*
for
the
literature
of
negation
,
very
quickly
assimilates
all
the
*NL*
extracts
of
the
science
of
negation
,
and
he
's
ready
.
And
that
's
not
*NL*
all
--
twenty
years
ago
he
would
have
found
in
that
literature
traces
of
*NL*
conflict
with
authorities
,
with
the
creeds
of
the
ages
;
he
would
have
*NL*
perceived
from
this
conflict
that
there
was
something
else
;
but
now
he
*NL*
comes
at
once
upon
a
literature
in
which
the
old
creeds
do
not
even
*NL*
furnish
matter
for
discussion
,
but
it
is
stated
baldly
that
there
is
*NL*
nothing
else
--
evolution
,
natural
selection
,
struggle
for
existence
--
and
*NL*
that
's
all
.

said
Anna
,
who
had
for
a
long
while
been
exchanging
*NL*
wary
glances
with
Vronsky
,
and
knew
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
interested
in
the
education
of
this
artist
,
but
was
simply
absorbed
by
*NL*
the
idea
of
assisting
him
,
and
ordering
a
portrait
of
him
;
``
I
tell
you
*NL*
what
,
''
she
said
,
resolutely
interrupting
Golenishtchev
,
who
was
still
*NL*
talking
away
,
``
let
's
go
and
see
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Golenishtchev
recovered
his
self-possession
and
readily
agreed
.
But
as
*NL*
the
artist
lived
in
a
remote
suburb
,
it
was
decided
to
take
the
*NL*
carriage
.

An
hour
later
Anna
,
with
Golenishtchev
by
her
side
and
Vronsky
on
the
*NL*
front
seat
of
the
carriage
,
facing
them
,
drove
up
to
a
new
ugly
house
in

the
remote
suburb

On
learning
from
the
porter

wife

who
came
out
to

them

that
Mihailov
saw

that

he
was
in

only
a

off

the
cards
of
Count

into

managed

off

run
so
long
;
it
's
not
my
fault
.
If
I
had
the
money
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
in
peace
,
for
God
's
sake
!
''
Mihailov
shrieked
,
with
tears
in
*NL*
his
voice
,
and
,
stopping
his
ears
,
he
went
off
into
his
working
room
,
*NL*
the
other
side
of
a
partition
wall
,
and
closed
the
door
after
him
.
*NL*
``
Idiotic
woman
!
''
he
said
to
himself
,
sat
down
to
the
table
,
and
,
opening
*NL*
a
portfolio
,
he
set
to
work
at
once
with
peculiar
fervor
at
a
sketch
he
*NL*
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
did
he
work
with
such
fervor
and
success
as
when
things
went
ill
*NL*
with
him
,
and
especially
when
he
quarreled
with
his
wife
.
``
Oh
!
damn
them
*NL*
all
!
''
he
thought
as
he
went
on
working
.
He
was
making
a
sketch
for
the
*NL*
figure
of
a
man
in
a
violent
rage
.
A
sketch
had
been
made
before
,
but
he
*NL*
was
dissatisfied
with
it
.
``
No
,
that
one
was
better
...
where
is
it
?
''
He
*NL*
went
back
to
his
wife
,
and
scowling
,
and
not
looking
at
her
,
asked
his
*NL*
eldest
little
girl
,
where
was
that
piece
of
paper
he
had
given
them
?
The
*NL*
paper
with
the
discarded
sketch
on
it
was
found
,
but
it
was
dirty
,
and
*NL*
spotted
with
candle-grease
.
Still
,
he
took
the
sketch
,
laid
it
on
his
*NL*
table
,
and
,
moving
a
little
away
,
screwing
up
his
eyes
,
he
fell
to
*NL*
gazing
at
it
.
All
at
once
he
smiled
and
gesticulated
gleefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
that
's
it
!
''
he
said
,
and
,
at
once
picking
up
the
pencil
,
he
*NL*
began
rapidly
drawing
.
The
spot
of
tallow
had
given
the
man
a
new
pose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sketched
this
new
pose
,
when
all
at
once
he
recalled
the
face
of
*NL*
a
shopkeeper
of
whom
he
had
bought
cigars
,
a
vigorous
face
with
a
*NL*
prominent
chin
,
and
he
sketched
this
very
face
,
this
chin
on
to
the
*NL*
figure
of
the
man
.
He
laughed
aloud
with
delight
.
The
figure
from
a
*NL*
lifeless
imagined
thing
had
become
living
,
and
such
that
it
could
never
*NL*
be
changed
.
That
figure
lived
,
and
was
clearly
and
unmistakably
defined
.
*NL*
The
sketch
might
be
corrected
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
*NL*
figure
,
the
legs
,
indeed
,
could
and
must
be
put
differently
,
and
the
*NL*
position
of
the
left
hand
must
be
quite
altered
;
the
hair
too
might
be
*NL*
thrown
back
.
But
in
making
these
corrections
he
was
not
altering
the
*NL*
figure
but
simply
getting
rid
of
what
concealed
the
figure
.
He
was
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
stripping
off
the
wrappings
which
hindered
it
from
being
*NL*
distinctly
seen
.
Each
new
feature
only
brought
out
the
whole
figure
in
*NL*
all
its
force
and
vigor
,
as
it
had
suddenly
come
to
him
from
the
spot
of
*NL*
tallow
.
He
was
carefully
finishing
the
figure
when
the
cards
were
*NL*
brought
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
,
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
in
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Sasha
,
do
n't
be
cross
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
timidly
and
*NL*
affectionately
at
her
.
``
You
were
to
blame
.
I
was
to
blame
.
I
'll
make
it
*NL*
all
right
.
''
And
having
made
peace
with
his
wife
he
put
on
an
olive-green
*NL*
overcoat
with
a
velvet
collar
and
a
hat
,
and
went
towards
his
studio
.
*NL*
The
successful
figure
he
had
already
forgotten
.
Now
he
was
delighted
and
*NL*
excited
at
the
visit
of
these
people
of
consequence
,
Russians
,
who
had
*NL*
come
in
their
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
his
picture
,
the
one
that
stood
now
on
his
easel
,
he
had
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
his
heart
one
conviction
--
that
no
one
had
ever
painted
a
*NL*
picture
like
it
.
He
did
not
believe
that
his
picture
was
better
than
all
*NL*
the
pictures
of
Raphael
,
but
he
knew
that
what
he
tried
to
convey
in
*NL*
that
picture
,
no
one
ever
had
conveyed
.
This
he
knew
positively
,
and
had
*NL*
known
a
long
while
,
ever
since
he
had
begun
to
paint
it
.
But
other
*NL*
people
's
criticisms
,
whatever
they
might
be
,
had
yet
immense
consequence
*NL*
in
his
eyes
,
and
they
agitated
him
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
.
Any
*NL*
remark
,
the
most
insignificant
,
that
showed
that
the
critic
saw
even
the
*NL*
tiniest
part
of
what
he
saw
in
the
picture
,
agitated
him
to
the
depths
*NL*
of
his
soul
.
He
always
attributed
to
his
critics
a
more
profound
*NL*
comprehension
than
he
had
himself
,
and
always
expected
from
them
*NL*
something
he
did
not
himself
see
in
the
picture
.
And
often
in
their
*NL*
criticisms
he
fancied
that
he
had
found
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
rapidly
to
the
door
of
his
studio
,
and
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
excitement
he
was
struck
by
the
soft
light
on
Anna
's
figure
as
she
stood
*NL*
in
the
shade
of
the
entrance
listening
to
Golenishtchev
,
who
was
eagerly
*NL*
telling
her
something
,
while
she
evidently
wanted
to
look
round
at
the
*NL*
artist
.
He
was
himself
unconscious
how
,
as
he
approached
them
,
he
seized
*NL*
on
this
impression
and
absorbed
it
,
as
he
had
the
chin
of
the
shopkeeper
*NL*
who
had
sold
him
the
cigars
,
and
put
it
away
somewhere
to
be
brought
out
*NL*
when
he
wanted
it
.
The
visitors
,
not
agreeably
impressed
beforehand
by
*NL*
Golenishtchev
's
account
of
the
artist
,
were
still
less
so
by
his
*NL*
personal
appearance
.
Thick-set
and
of
middle
height
,
with
nimble
*NL*
movements
,
with
his
brown
hat
,
olive-green
coat
and
narrow
*NL*
trousers
--
though
wide
trousers
had
been
a
long
while
in
fashion
,
--
most
*NL*
of
all
,
with
the
ordinariness
of
his
broad
face
,
and
the
combined
*NL*
expression
of
timidity
and
anxiety
to
keep
up
his
dignity
,
Mihailov
made
*NL*
an
unpleasant
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
step
in
,
''
he
said
,
trying
to
look
indifferent
,
and
going
into
*NL*
the
passage
he
took
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
studio
,
Mihailov
once
more
scanned
his
visitors
and
*NL*
noted
down
in
his
imagination
Vronsky
's
expression
too
,
and
especially
*NL*
his
jaws
.
Although
his
artistic
sense
was
unceasingly
at
work
collecting
*NL*
materials
,
although
he
felt
a
continually
increasing
excitement
as
the
*NL*
moment
of
criticizing
his
work
drew
nearer
,
he
rapidly
and
subtly
*NL*
formed
,
from
imperceptible
signs
,
a
mental
image
of
these
three
persons
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
fellow
-LRB-
Golenishtchev
-RRB-
was
a
Russian
living
here
.
Mihailov
did
not
*NL*
remember
his
surname
nor
where
he
had
met
him
,
nor
what
he
had
said
to
*NL*
him
.
He
only
remembered
his
face
as
he
remembered
all
the
faces
he
had
*NL*
ever
seen
;
but
he
remembered
,
too
,
that
it
was
one
of
the
faces
laid
by
*NL*
in
his
memory
in
the
immense
class
of
the
falsely
consequential
and
poor
*NL*
in
expression
.
The
abundant
hair
and
very
open
forehead
gave
an
*NL*
appearance
of
consequence
to
the
face
,
which
had
only
one
expression
--
a
*NL*
petty
,
childish
,
peevish
expression
,
concentrated
just
above
the
bridge
*NL*
of
the
narrow
nose
.
Vronsky
and
Madame
Karenina
must
be
,
Mihailov
*NL*
supposed
,
distinguished
and
wealthy
Russians
,
knowing
nothing
about
art
,
*NL*
like
all
those
wealthy
Russians
,
but
posing
as
amateurs
and
*NL*
connoisseurs
.
``
Most
likely
they
've
already
looked
at
all
the
antiques
,
*NL*
and
now
they
're
making
the
round
of
the
studios
of
the
new
people
,
the
*NL*
German
humbug
,
and
the
cracked
Pre-Raphaelite
English
fellow
,
and
have
*NL*
only
come
to
me
to
make
the
point
of
view
complete
,
''
he
thought
.
He
was
*NL*
well
acquainted
with
the
way
dilettanti
have
-LRB-
the
cleverer
they
were
the
*NL*
worse
he
found
them
-RRB-
of
looking
at
the
works
of
contemporary
artists
*NL*
with
the
sole
object
of
being
in
a
position
to
say
that
art
is
a
thing
*NL*
of
the
past
,
and
that
the
more
one
sees
of
the
new
men
the
more
one
sees
*NL*
how
inimitable
the
works
of
the
great
old
masters
have
remained
.
He
*NL*
expected
all
this
;
he
saw
it
all
in
their
faces
,
he
saw
it
in
the
*NL*
careless
indifference
with
which
they
talked
among
themselves
,
stared
at
*NL*
the
lay
figures
and
busts
,
and
walked
about
in
leisurely
fashion
,
*NL*
waiting
for
him
to
uncover
his
picture
.
But
in
spite
of
this
,
while
he
*NL*
was
turning
over
his
studies
,
pulling
up
the
blinds
and
taking
off
the
*NL*
sheet
,
he
was
in
intense
excitement
,
especially
as
,
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
conviction
that
all
distinguished
and
wealthy
Russians
were
certain
to
*NL*
be
beasts
and
fools
,
he
liked
Vronsky
,
and
still
more
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
if
you
please
,
''
he
said
,
moving
on
one
side
with
his
nimble
gait
*NL*
and
pointing
to
his
picture
,
``
it
's
the
exhortation
to
Pilate
.
Matthew
,
*NL*
chapter
xxvii
,
''
he
said
,
feeling
his
lips
were
beginning
to
tremble
with
*NL*
emotion
.
He
moved
away
and
stood
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
few
seconds
during
which
the
visitors
were
gazing
at
the
picture
*NL*
in
silence
Mihailov
too
gazed
at
it
with
the
indifferent
eye
of
an
*NL*
outsider
.
For
those
few
seconds
he
was
sure
in
anticipation
that
a
*NL*
higher
,
juster
criticism
would
be
uttered
by
them
,
by
those
very
*NL*
visitors
whom
he
had
been
so
despising
a
moment
before
.
He
forgot
all
he
*NL*
had
thought
about
his
picture
before
during
the
three
years
he
had
been
*NL*
painting
it
;
he
forgot
all
its
qualities
which
had
been
absolutely
*NL*
certain
to
him
--
he
saw
the
picture
with
their
indifferent
,
new
,
outside
*NL*
eyes
,
and
saw
nothing
good
in
it
.
He
saw
in
the
foreground
Pilate
's
*NL*
irritated
face
and
the
serene
face
of
Christ
,
and
in
the
background
the
*NL*
figures
of
Pilate
's
retinue
and
the
face
of
John
watching
what
was
*NL*
happening
.
Every
face
that
,
with
such
agony
,
such
blunders
and
*NL*
corrections
had
grown
up
within
him
with
its
special
character
,
every
*NL*
face
that
had
given
him
such
torments
and
such
raptures
,
and
all
these
*NL*
faces
so
many
times
transposed
for
the
sake
of
the
harmony
of
the
whole
,
*NL*
all
the
shades
of
color
and
tones
that
he
had
attained
with
such
*NL*
labor
--
all
of
this
together
seemed
to
him
now
,
looking
at
it
with
their
*NL*
eyes
,
the
merest
vulgarity
,
something
that
had
been
done
a
thousand
*NL*
times
over
.
The
face
dearest
to
him
,
the
face
of
Christ
,
the
center
of
*NL*
the
picture
,
which
had
given
him
such
ecstasy
as
it
unfolded
itself
to
*NL*
him
,
was
utterly
lost
to
him
when
he
glanced
at
the
picture
with
their
*NL*
eyes
.
He
saw
a
well-painted
-LRB-
no
,
not
even
that
--
he
distinctly
saw
now
a
*NL*
mass
of
defects
-RRB-
repetition
of
those
endless
Christs
of
Titian
,
Raphael
,
*NL*
Rubens
,
and
the
same
soldiers
and
Pilate
.
It
was
all
common
,
poor
,
and
*NL*
stale
,
and
positively
badly
painted
--
weak
and
unequal
.
They
would
be
*NL*
justified
in
repeating
hypocritically
civil
speeches
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
painter
,
and
pitying
him
and
laughing
at
him
when
they
were
alone
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
-LRB-
though
it
lasted
no
more
than
a
minute
-RRB-
became
too
*NL*
intolerable
to
him
.
To
break
it
,
and
to
show
he
was
not
agitated
,
he
*NL*
made
an
effort
and
addressed
Golenishtchev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
,
''
he
said
,
looking
*NL*
uneasily
first
at
Anna
,
then
at
Vronsky
,
in
fear
of
losing
any
shade
of
*NL*
their
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
We
met
at
Rossi
's
,
do
you
remember
,
at
that
_
soiree
_
when
*NL*
that
Italian
lady
recited
--
the
new
Rachel
?
''
Golenishtchev
answered
*NL*
easily
,
removing
his
eyes
without
the
slightest
regret
from
the
picture
*NL*
and
turning
to
the
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
,
however
,
that
Mihailov
was
expecting
a
criticism
of
the
*NL*
picture
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
picture
has
got
on
a
great
deal
since
I
saw
it
last
time
;
and
what
*NL*
strikes
me
particularly
now
,
as
it
did
then
,
is
the
figure
of
Pilate
.
*NL*
One
so
knows
the
man
:
a
good-natured
,
capital
fellow
,
but
an
official
*NL*
through
and
through
,
who
does
not
know
what
it
is
he
's
doing
.
But
I
*NL*
fancy
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
Mihailov
's
mobile
face
beamed
at
once
;
his
eyes
sparkled
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
say
something
,
but
he
could
not
speak
for
excitement
,
and
pretended
*NL*
to
be
coughing
.
Low
as
was
his
opinion
of
Golenishtchev
's
capacity
for
*NL*
understanding
art
,
trifling
as
was
the
true
remark
upon
the
fidelity
of
*NL*
the
expression
of
Pilate
as
an
official
,
and
offensive
as
might
have
*NL*
seemed
the
utterance
of
so
unimportant
an
observation
while
nothing
was
*NL*
said
of
more
serious
points
,
Mihailov
was
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
at
*NL*
this
observation
.
He
had
himself
thought
about
Pilate
's
figure
just
what
*NL*
Golenishtchev
said
.
The
fact
that
this
reflection
was
but
one
of
*NL*
millions
of
reflections
,
which
as
Mihailov
knew
for
certain
would
be
*NL*
true
,
did
not
diminish
for
him
the
significance
of
Golenishtchev
's
*NL*
remark
.
His
heart
warmed
to
Golenishtchev
for
this
remark
,
and
from
a
*NL*
state
of
depression
he
suddenly
passed
to
ecstasy
.
At
once
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
picture
lived
before
him
in
all
the
indescribable
complexity
of
*NL*
everything
living
.
Mihailov
again
tried
to
say
that
that
was
how
he
*NL*
understood
Pilate
,
but
his
lips
quivered
intractably
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
pronounce
the
words
.
Vronsky
and
Anna
too
said
something
in
that
subdued
*NL*
voice
in
which
,
partly
to
avoid
hurting
the
artist
's
feelings
and
partly
*NL*
to
avoid
saying
out
loud
something
silly
--
so
easily
said
when
talking
of
*NL*
art
--
people
usually
speak
at
exhibitions
of
pictures
.
Mihailov
fancied
*NL*
that
the
picture
had
made
an
impression
on
them
too
.
He
went
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
marvelous
Christ
's
expression
is
!
''
said
Anna
.
Of
all
she
saw
she
*NL*
liked
that
expression
most
of
all
,
and
she
felt
that
it
was
the
center
*NL*
of
the
picture
,
and
so
praise
of
it
would
be
pleasant
to
the
artist
.
*NL*
``
One
can
see
that
He
is
pitying
Pilate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
again
was
one
of
the
million
true
reflections
that
could
be
found
*NL*
in
his
picture
and
in
the
figure
of
Christ
.
She
said
that
He
was
pitying
*NL*
Pilate
.
In
Christ
's
expression
there
ought
to
be
indeed
an
expression
of
*NL*
pity
,
since
there
is
an
expression
of
love
,
of
heavenly
peace
,
of
*NL*
readiness
for
death
,
and
a
sense
of
the
vanity
of
words
.
Of
course
there
*NL*
is
the
expression
of
an
official
in
Pilate
and
of
pity
in
Christ
,
seeing
*NL*
that
one
is
the
incarnation
of
the
fleshly
and
the
other
of
the
*NL*
spiritual
life
.
All
this
and
much
more
flashed
into
Mihailov
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
how
that
figure
is
done
--
what
atmosphere
!
One
can
walk
round
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Golenishtchev
,
unmistakably
betraying
by
this
remark
that
he
*NL*
did
not
approve
of
the
meaning
and
idea
of
the
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
a
wonderful
mastery
!
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
How
those
figures
in
*NL*
the
background
stand
out
!
There
you
have
technique
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
*NL*
Golenishtchev
,
alluding
to
a
conversation
between
them
about
Vronsky
's
*NL*
despair
of
attaining
this
technique
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
marvelous
!
''
Golenishtchev
and
Anna
assented
.
In
spite
of
the
*NL*
excited
condition
in
which
he
was
,
the
sentence
about
technique
had
sent
*NL*
a
pang
to
Mihailov
's
heart
,
and
looking
angrily
at
Vronsky
he
suddenly
*NL*
scowled
.
He
had
often
heard
this
word
technique
,
and
was
utterly
unable
*NL*
to
understand
what
was
understood
by
it
.
He
knew
that
by
this
term
was
*NL*
understood
a
mechanical
facility
for
painting
or
drawing
,
entirely
apart
*NL*
from
its
subject
.
He
had
noticed
often
that
even
in
actual
praise
*NL*
technique
was
opposed
to
essential
quality
,
as
though
one
could
paint
*NL*
well
something
that
was
bad
.
He
knew
that
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
*NL*
care
was
necessary
in
taking
off
the
coverings
,
to
avoid
injuring
the
*NL*
creation
itself
,
and
to
take
off
all
the
coverings
;
but
there
was
no
art
*NL*
of
painting
--
no
technique
of
any
sort
--
about
it
.
If
to
a
little
child
or
*NL*
to
his
cook
were
revealed
what
he
saw
,
it
or
she
would
have
been
able
to
*NL*
peel
the
wrappings
off
what
was
seen
.
And
the
most
experienced
and
*NL*
adroit
painter
could
not
by
mere
mechanical
facility
paint
anything
if
*NL*
the
lines
of
the
subject
were
not
revealed
to
him
first
.
Besides
,
he
saw
*NL*
that
if
it
came
to
talking
about
technique
,
it
was
impossible
to
praise
*NL*
him
for
it
.
In
all
he
had
painted
and
repainted
he
saw
faults
that
hurt
*NL*
his
eyes
,
coming
from
want
of
care
in
taking
off
the
wrappings
--
faults
*NL*
he
could
not
correct
now
without
spoiling
the
whole
.
And
in
almost
all
*NL*
the
figures
and
faces
he
saw
,
too
,
remnants
of
the
wrappings
not
*NL*
perfectly
removed
that
spoiled
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
might
be
said
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
make
the
remark
...
''
*NL*
observed
Golenishtchev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
shall
be
delighted
,
I
beg
you
,
''
said
Mihailov
with
a
forced
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
that
you
make
Him
the
man-god
,
and
not
the
God-man
.
But
I
know
*NL*
that
was
what
you
meant
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
paint
a
Christ
that
is
not
in
my
heart
,
''
said
Mihailov
*NL*
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
in
that
case
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
what
I
think
...
*NL*
Your
picture
is
so
fine
that
my
observation
can
not
detract
from
it
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
it
is
only
my
personal
opinion
.
With
you
it
is
different
.
Your
*NL*
very
motive
is
different
.
But
let
us
take
Ivanov
.
I
imagine
that
if
*NL*
Christ
is
brought
down
to
the
level
of
an
historical
character
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
better
for
Ivanov
to
select
some
other
historical
subject
,
*NL*
fresh
,
untouched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
this
is
the
greatest
subject
presented
to
art
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
looked
one
would
find
others
.
But
the
point
is
that
art
can
not
*NL*
suffer
doubt
and
discussion
.
And
before
the
picture
of
Ivanov
the
*NL*
question
arises
for
the
believer
and
the
unbeliever
alike
,
`
Is
it
God
,
*NL*
or
is
it
not
God
?
'
and
the
unity
of
the
impression
is
destroyed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
I
think
that
for
educated
people
,
''
said
Mihailov
,
``
the
question
*NL*
can
not
exist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Golenishtchev
did
not
agree
with
this
,
and
confounded
Mihailov
by
his
*NL*
support
of
his
first
idea
of
the
unity
of
the
impression
being
essential
*NL*
to
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mihailov
was
greatly
perturbed
,
but
he
could
say
nothing
in
defense
of
*NL*
his
own
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
12
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
and
Vronsky
had
long
been
exchanging
glances
,
regretting
their
*NL*
friend
's
flow
of
cleverness
.
At
last
Vronsky
,
without
waiting
for
the
*NL*
artist
,
walked
away
to
another
small
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
exquisite
!
What
a
lovely
thing
!
A
gem
!
How
exquisite
!
''
they
*NL*
cried
with
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
they
're
so
pleased
with
?
''
thought
Mihailov
.
He
had
*NL*
positively
forgotten
that
picture
he
had
painted
three
years
ago
.
He
had
*NL*
forgotten
all
the
agonies
and
the
ecstasies
he
had
lived
through
with
*NL*
that
picture
when
for
several
months
it
had
been
the
one
thought
*NL*
haunting
him
day
and
night
.
He
had
forgotten
,
as
he
always
forgot
,
the
*NL*
pictures
he
had
finished
.
He
did
not
even
like
to
look
at
it
,
and
had
*NL*
only
brought
it
out
because
he
was
expecting
an
Englishman
who
wanted
to
*NL*
buy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
only
an
old
study
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fine
!
''
said
Golenishtchev
,
he
too
,
with
unmistakable
sincerity
,
*NL*
falling
under
the
spell
of
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
boys
were
angling
in
the
shade
of
a
willow-tree
.
The
elder
had
just
*NL*
dropped
in
the
hook
,
and
was
carefully
pulling
the
float
from
behind
a
*NL*
bush
,
entirely
absorbed
in
what
he
was
doing
.
The
other
,
a
little
*NL*
younger
,
was
lying
in
the
grass
leaning
on
his
elbows
,
with
his
tangled
,
*NL*
flaxen
head
in
his
hands
,
staring
at
the
water
with
his
dreamy
blue
*NL*
eyes
.
What
was
he
thinking
of
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
enthusiasm
over
this
picture
stirred
some
of
the
old
feeling
for
it
*NL*
in
Mihailov
,
but
he
feared
and
disliked
this
waste
of
feeling
for
things
*NL*
past
,
and
so
,
even
though
this
praise
was
grateful
to
him
,
he
tried
to
*NL*
draw
his
visitors
away
to
a
third
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Vronsky
asked
whether
the
picture
was
for
sale
.
To
Mihailov
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
excited
by
visitors
,
it
was
extremely
distasteful
to
speak
of
*NL*
money
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
put
up
there
to
be
sold
,
''
he
answered
,
scowling
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
visitors
had
gone
,
Mihailov
sat
down
opposite
the
picture
of
*NL*
Pilate
and
Christ
,
and
in
his
mind
went
over
what
had
been
said
,
and
*NL*
what
,
though
not
said
,
had
been
implied
by
those
visitors
.
And
,
strange
*NL*
to
say
,
what
had
had
such
weight
with
him
,
while
they
were
there
and
*NL*
while
he
mentally
put
himself
at
their
point
of
view
,
suddenly
lost
all
*NL*
importance
for
him
.
He
began
to
look
at
his
picture
with
all
his
own
*NL*
full
artist
vision
,
and
was
soon
in
that
mood
of
conviction
of
the
*NL*
perfectibility
,
and
so
of
the
significance
,
of
his
picture
--
a
conviction
*NL*
essential
to
the
most
intense
fervor
,
excluding
all
other
interests
--
in
*NL*
which
alone
he
could
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christ
's
foreshortened
leg
was
not
right
,
though
.
He
took
his
palette
*NL*
and
began
to
work
.
As
he
corrected
the
leg
he
looked
continually
at
the
*NL*
figure
of
John
in
the
background
,
which
his
visitors
had
not
even
*NL*
noticed
,
but
which
he
knew
was
beyond
perfection
.
When
he
had
finished
*NL*
the
leg
he
wanted
to
touch
that
figure
,
but
he
felt
too
much
excited
for
*NL*
it
.
He
was
equally
unable
to
work
when
he
was
cold
and
when
he
was
too
*NL*
much
affected
and
saw
everything
too
much
.
There
was
only
one
stage
in
*NL*
the
transition
from
coldness
to
inspiration
,
at
which
work
was
possible
.
*NL*
Today
he
was
too
much
agitated
.
He
would
have
covered
the
picture
,
but
*NL*
he
stopped
,
holding
the
cloth
in
his
hand
,
and
,
smiling
blissfully
,
*NL*
gazed
a
long
while
at
the
figure
of
John
.
At
last
,
as
it
were
*NL*
regretfully
tearing
himself
away
,
he
dropped
the
cloth
,
and
,
exhausted
*NL*
but
happy
,
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
Anna
,
and
Golenishtchev
,
on
their
way
home
,
were
particularly
*NL*
lively
and
cheerful
.
They
talked
of
Mihailov
and
his
pictures
.
The
word
*NL*
_
talent
_
,
by
which
they
meant
an
inborn
,
almost
physical
,
aptitude
apart
*NL*
from
brain
and
heart
,
and
in
which
they
tried
to
find
an
expression
for
*NL*
all
the
artist
had
gained
from
life
,
recurred
particularly
often
in
*NL*
their
talk
,
as
though
it
were
necessary
for
them
to
sum
up
what
they
had
*NL*
no
conception
of
,
though
they
wanted
to
talk
of
it
.
They
said
that
there
*NL*
was
no
denying
his
talent
,
but
that
his
talent
could
not
develop
for
*NL*
want
of
education
--
the
common
defect
of
our
Russian
artists
.
But
the
*NL*
picture
of
the
boys
had
imprinted
itself
on
their
memories
,
and
they
*NL*
were
continually
coming
back
to
it
.
``
What
an
exquisite
thing
!
How
he
has
*NL*
succeeded
in
it
,
and
how
simply
!
He
does
n't
even
comprehend
how
good
it
*NL*
is
.
Yes
,
I
must
n't
let
it
slip
;
I
must
buy
it
,
''
said
Vronsky
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
13
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mihailov
sold
Vronsky
his
picture
,
and
agreed
to
paint
a
portrait
of
*NL*
Anna
.
On
the
day
fixed
he
came
and
began
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
fifth
sitting
the
portrait
impressed
everyone
,
especially
*NL*
Vronsky
,
not
only
by
its
resemblance
,
but
by
its
characteristic
beauty
.
*NL*
It
was
strange
how
Mihailov
could
have
discovered
just
her
*NL*
characteristic
beauty
.
``
One
needs
to
know
and
love
her
as
I
have
loved
*NL*
her
to
discover
the
very
sweetest
expression
of
her
soul
,
''
Vronsky
*NL*
thought
,
though
it
was
only
from
this
portrait
that
he
had
himself
*NL*
learned
this
sweetest
expression
of
her
soul
.
But
the
expression
was
so
*NL*
true
that
he
,
and
others
too
,
fancied
they
had
long
known
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
struggling
on
for
ever
so
long
without
doing
anything
,
''
he
*NL*
said
of
his
own
portrait
of
her
,
``
and
he
just
looked
and
painted
it
.
*NL*
That
's
where
technique
comes
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
come
,
''
was
the
consoling
reassurance
given
him
by
*NL*
Golenishtchev
,
in
whose
view
Vronsky
had
both
talent
,
and
what
was
most
*NL*
important
,
culture
,
giving
him
a
wider
outlook
on
art
.
Golenishtchev
's
*NL*
faith
in
Vronsky
's
talent
was
propped
up
by
his
own
need
of
Vronsky
's
*NL*
sympathy
and
approval
for
his
own
articles
and
ideas
,
and
he
felt
that
*NL*
the
praise
and
support
must
be
mutual
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
man
's
house
,
and
especially
in
Vronsky
's
palazzo
,
Mihailov
*NL*
was
quite
a
different
man
from
what
he
was
in
his
studio
.
He
behaved
*NL*
with
hostile
courtesy
,
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
coming
closer
to
*NL*
people
he
did
not
respect
.
He
called
Vronsky
``
your
excellency
,
''
and
*NL*
notwithstanding
Anna
's
and
Vronsky
's
invitations
,
he
would
never
stay
to
*NL*
dinner
,
nor
come
except
for
the
sittings
.
Anna
was
even
more
friendly
to
*NL*
him
than
to
other
people
,
and
was
very
grateful
for
her
portrait
.
*NL*
Vronsky
was
more
than
cordial
with
him
,
and
was
obviously
interested
to
*NL*
know
the
artist
's
opinion
of
his
picture
.
Golenishtchev
never
let
slip
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
instilling
sound
ideas
about
art
into
Mihailov
.
But
*NL*
Mihailov
remained
equally
chilly
to
all
of
them
.
Anna
was
aware
from
his
*NL*
eyes
that
he
liked
looking
at
her
,
but
he
avoided
conversation
with
her
.
*NL*
Vronsky
's
talk
about
his
painting
he
met
with
stubborn
silence
,
and
he
*NL*
was
as
stubbornly
silent
when
he
was
shown
Vronsky
's
picture
.
He
was
*NL*
unmistakably
bored
by
Golenishtchev
's
conversation
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
attempt
to
oppose
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
Mihailov
,
with
his
reserved
and
disagreeable
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
hostile
attitude
,
was
quite
disliked
by
them
as
they
got
to
know
him
*NL*
better
;
and
they
were
glad
when
the
sittings
were
over
,
and
they
were
*NL*
left
with
a
magnificent
portrait
in
their
possession
,
and
he
gave
up
*NL*
coming
.
Golenishtchev
was
the
first
to
give
expression
to
an
idea
that
*NL*
had
occurred
to
all
of
them
,
which
was
that
Mihailov
was
simply
jealous
*NL*
of
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
envious
,
let
us
say
,
since
he
has
_
talent
_
;
but
it
annoys
him
that
*NL*
a
wealthy
man
of
the
highest
society
,
and
a
count
,
too
-LRB-
you
know
they
*NL*
all
detest
a
title
-RRB-
,
can
,
without
any
particular
trouble
,
do
as
well
,
if
*NL*
not
better
,
than
he
who
has
devoted
all
his
life
to
it
.
And
more
than
*NL*
all
,
it
's
a
question
of
culture
,
which
he
is
without
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
defended
Mihailov
,
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
believed
*NL*
it
,
because
in
his
view
a
man
of
a
different
,
lower
world
would
be
sure
*NL*
to
be
envious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
's
portrait
--
the
same
subject
painted
from
nature
both
by
him
and
by
*NL*
Mihailov
--
ought
to
have
shown
Vronsky
the
difference
between
him
and
*NL*
Mihailov
;
but
he
did
not
see
it
.
Only
after
Mihailov
's
portrait
was
*NL*
painted
he
left
off
painting
his
portrait
of
Anna
,
deciding
that
it
was
*NL*
now
not
needed
.
His
picture
of
mediaeval
life
he
went
on
with
.
And
he
*NL*
himself
,
and
Golenishtchev
,
and
still
more
Anna
,
thought
it
very
good
,
*NL*
because
it
was
far
more
like
the
celebrated
pictures
they
knew
than
*NL*
Mihailov
's
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mihailov
meanwhile
,
although
Anna
's
portrait
greatly
fascinated
him
,
was
*NL*
even
more
glad
than
they
were
when
the
sittings
were
over
,
and
he
had
no
*NL*
longer
to
listen
to
Golenishtchev
's
disquisitions
upon
art
,
and
could
*NL*
forget
about
Vronsky
's
painting
.
He
knew
that
Vronsky
could
not
be
*NL*
prevented
from
amusing
himself
with
painting
;
he
knew
that
he
and
all
*NL*
dilettanti
had
a
perfect
right
to
paint
what
they
liked
,
but
it
was
*NL*
distasteful
to
him
.
A
man
could
not
be
prevented
from
making
himself
a
*NL*
big
wax
doll
,
and
kissing
it
.
But
if
the
man
were
to
come
with
the
doll
*NL*
and
sit
before
a
man
in
love
,
and
begin
caressing
his
doll
as
the
lover
*NL*
caressed
the
woman
he
loved
,
it
would
be
distasteful
to
the
lover
.
Just
*NL*
such
a
distasteful
sensation
was
what
Mihailov
felt
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
Vronsky
's
painting
:
he
felt
it
both
ludicrous
and
irritating
,
both
*NL*
pitiable
and
offensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
interest
in
painting
and
the
Middle
Ages
did
not
last
long
.
He
*NL*
had
enough
taste
for
painting
to
be
unable
to
finish
his
picture
.
The
*NL*
picture
came
to
a
standstill
.
He
was
vaguely
aware
that
its
defects
,
*NL*
inconspicuous
at
first
,
would
be
glaring
if
he
were
to
go
on
with
it
.
*NL*
The
same
experience
befell
him
as
Golenishtchev
,
who
felt
that
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
say
,
and
continually
deceived
himself
with
the
theory
that
*NL*
his
idea
was
not
yet
mature
,
that
he
was
working
it
out
and
collecting
*NL*
materials
.
This
exasperated
and
tortured
Golenishtchev
,
but
Vronsky
was
*NL*
incapable
of
deceiving
and
torturing
himself
,
and
even
more
incapable
of
*NL*
exasperation
.
With
his
characteristic
decision
,
without
explanation
or
*NL*
apology
,
he
simply
ceased
working
at
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
without
this
occupation
,
the
life
of
Vronsky
and
of
Anna
,
who
*NL*
wondered
at
his
loss
of
interest
in
it
,
struck
them
as
intolerably
*NL*
tedious
in
an
Italian
town
.
The
palazzo
suddenly
seemed
so
obtrusively
*NL*
old
and
dirty
,
the
spots
on
the
curtains
,
the
cracks
in
the
floors
,
the
*NL*
broken
plaster
on
the
cornices
became
so
disagreeably
obvious
,
and
the
*NL*
everlasting
sameness
of
Golenishtchev
,
and
the
Italian
professor
and
the
*NL*
German
traveler
became
so
wearisome
,
that
they
had
to
make
some
change
.
*NL*
They
resolved
to
go
to
Russia
,
to
the
country
.
In
Petersburg
Vronsky
*NL*
intended
to
arrange
a
partition
of
the
land
with
his
brother
,
while
Anna
*NL*
meant
to
see
her
son
.
The
summer
they
intended
to
spend
on
Vronsky
's
*NL*
great
family
estate
.

Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
been
married
three
months
.
He
was
happy
,
but
not
at
all
in
the
*NL*
way
he
had
expected
to
be
.
At
every
step
he
found
his
former
dreams
*NL*
disappointed
,
and
new
,
unexpected
surprises
of
happiness
.
He
was
happy
;
*NL*
but
on
entering
upon
family
life
he
saw
at
every
step
that
it
was
*NL*
utterly
different
from
what
he
had
imagined
.
At
every
step
he
*NL*
experienced
what
a
man
would
experience
who
,
after
admiring
the
smooth
,
*NL*
happy
course
of
a
little
boat
on
a
lake
,
should
get
himself
into
that
*NL*
little
boat
.
He
saw
that
it
was
not
all
sitting
still
,
floating
*NL*
smoothly
;
that
one
had
to
think
too
,
not
for
an
instant
to
forget
where
*NL*
one
was
floating
;
and
that
there
was
water
under
one
,
and
that
one
must
*NL*
row
;
and
that
his
unaccustomed
hands
would
be
sore
;
and
that
it
was
only
*NL*
to
look
at
it
that
was
easy
;
but
that
doing
it
,
though
very
delightful
,
*NL*
was
very
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
bachelor
,
when
he
had
watched
other
people
's
married
life
,
seen
the
*NL*
petty
cares
,
the
squabbles
,
the
jealousy
,
he
had
only
smiled
*NL*
contemptuously
in
his
heart
.
In
his
future
married
life
there
could
be
,
*NL*
he
was
convinced
,
nothing
of
that
sort
;
even
the
external
forms
,
indeed
,
*NL*
he
fancied
,
must
be
utterly
unlike
the
life
of
others
in
everything
.
And
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
,
instead
of
his
life
with
his
wife
being
made
on
an
*NL*
individual
pattern
,
it
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
entirely
made
up
of
the
*NL*
pettiest
details
,
which
he
had
so
despised
before
,
but
which
now
,
by
no
*NL*
will
of
his
own
,
had
gained
an
extraordinary
importance
that
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
contend
against
.
And
Levin
saw
that
the
organization
of
all
*NL*
these
details
was
by
no
means
so
easy
as
he
had
fancied
before
.
Although
*NL*
Levin
believed
himself
to
have
the
most
exact
conceptions
of
domestic
*NL*
life
,
unconsciously
,
like
all
men
,
he
pictured
domestic
life
as
the
*NL*
happiest
enjoyment
of
love
,
with
nothing
to
hinder
and
no
petty
cares
to
*NL*
distract
.
He
ought
,
as
he
conceived
the
position
,
to
do
his
work
,
and
to
*NL*
find
repose
from
it
in
the
happiness
of
love
.
She
ought
to
be
beloved
,
*NL*
and
nothing
more
.
But
,
like
all
men
,
he
forgot
that
she
too
would
want
*NL*
work
.
And
he
was
surprised
that
she
,
his
poetic
,
exquisite
Kitty
,
could
,
*NL*
not
merely
in
the
first
weeks
,
but
even
in
the
first
days
of
their
*NL*
married
life
,
think
,
remember
,
and
busy
herself
about
tablecloths
,
and
*NL*
furniture
,
about
mattresses
for
visitors
,
about
a
tray
,
about
the
cook
,
*NL*
and
the
dinner
,
and
so
on
.
While
they
were
still
engaged
,
he
had
been
*NL*
struck
by
the
definiteness
with
which
she
had
declined
the
tour
abroad
*NL*
and
decided
to
go
into
the
country
,
as
though
she
knew
of
something
she
*NL*
wanted
,
and
could
still
think
of
something
outside
her
love
.
This
had
*NL*
jarred
upon
him
then
,
and
now
her
trivial
cares
and
anxieties
jarred
*NL*
upon
him
several
times
.
But
he
saw
that
this
was
essential
for
her
.
And
,
*NL*
loving
her
as
he
did
,
though
he
did
not
understand
the
reason
of
them
,
*NL*
and
jeered
at
these
domestic
pursuits
,
he
could
not
help
admiring
them
.
*NL*
He
jeered
at
the
way
in
which
she
arranged
the
furniture
they
had
*NL*
brought
from
Moscow
;
rearranged
their
room
;
hung
up
curtains
;
prepared
*NL*
rooms
for
visitors
;
a
room
for
Dolly
;
saw
after
an
abode
for
her
new
*NL*
maid
;
ordered
dinner
of
the
old
cook
;
came
into
collision
with
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
taking
from
her
the
charge
of
the
stores
.
He
saw
how
the
old
*NL*
cook
smiled
,
admiring
her
,
and
listening
to
her
inexperienced
,
*NL*
impossible
orders
,
how
mournfully
and
tenderly
Agafea
Mihalovna
shook
*NL*
her
head
over
the
young
mistress
's
new
arrangements
.
He
saw
that
Kitty
*NL*
was
extraordinarily
sweet
when
,
laughing
and
crying
,
she
came
to
tell
*NL*
him
that
her
maid
,
Masha
,
was
used
to
looking
upon
her
as
her
young
*NL*
lady
,
and
so
no
one
obeyed
her
.
It
seemed
to
him
sweet
,
but
strange
,
and
*NL*
he
thought
it
would
have
been
better
without
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
how
great
a
sense
of
change
she
was
experiencing
;
she
,
*NL*
who
at
home
had
sometimes
wanted
some
favorite
dish
,
or
sweets
,
without
*NL*
the
possibility
of
getting
either
,
now
could
order
what
she
liked
,
buy
*NL*
pounds
of
sweets
,
spend
as
much
money
as
she
liked
,
and
order
any
*NL*
puddings
she
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dreaming
with
delight
now
of
Dolly
's
coming
to
them
with
her
*NL*
children
,
especially
because
she
would
order
for
the
children
their
*NL*
favorite
puddings
and
Dolly
would
appreciate
all
her
new
housekeeping
.
*NL*
She
did
not
know
herself
why
and
wherefore
,
but
the
arranging
of
her
*NL*
house
had
an
irresistible
attraction
for
her
.
Instinctively
feeling
the
*NL*
approach
of
spring
,
and
knowing
that
there
would
be
days
of
rough
*NL*
weather
too
,
she
built
her
nest
as
best
she
could
,
and
was
in
haste
at
*NL*
the
same
time
to
build
it
and
to
learn
how
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
care
for
domestic
details
in
Kitty
,
so
opposed
to
Levin
's
ideal
of
*NL*
exalted
happiness
,
was
at
first
one
of
the
disappointments
;
and
this
*NL*
sweet
care
of
her
household
,
the
aim
of
which
he
did
not
understand
,
but
*NL*
could
not
help
loving
,
was
one
of
the
new
happy
surprises
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
disappointment
and
happy
surprise
came
in
their
quarrels
.
Levin
*NL*
could
never
have
conceived
that
between
him
and
his
wife
any
relations
*NL*
could
arise
other
than
tender
,
respectful
and
loving
,
and
all
at
once
in
*NL*
the
very
early
days
they
quarreled
,
so
that
she
said
he
did
not
care
for
*NL*
her
,
that
he
cared
for
no
one
but
himself
,
burst
into
tears
,
and
wrung
*NL*
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
quarrel
arose
from
Levin
's
having
gone
out
to
a
new
farmhouse
*NL*
and
having
been
away
half
an
hour
too
long
,
because
he
had
tried
to
get
*NL*
home
by
a
short
cut
and
had
lost
his
way
.
He
drove
home
thinking
of
*NL*
nothing
but
her
,
of
her
love
,
of
his
own
happiness
,
and
the
nearer
he
*NL*
drew
to
home
,
the
warmer
was
his
tenderness
for
her
.
He
ran
into
the
*NL*
room
with
the
same
feeling
,
with
an
even
stronger
feeling
than
he
had
*NL*
had
when
he
reached
the
Shtcherbatskys
'
house
to
make
his
offer
.
And
*NL*
suddenly
he
was
met
by
a
lowering
expression
he
had
never
seen
in
her
.
*NL*
He
would
have
kissed
her
;
she
pushed
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
enjoying
yourself
,
''
she
began
,
trying
to
be
calm
and
*NL*
spiteful
.
But
as
soon
as
she
opened
her
mouth
,
a
stream
of
reproach
,
of
*NL*
senseless
jealousy
,
of
all
that
had
been
torturing
her
during
that
half
*NL*
hour
which
she
had
spent
sitting
motionless
at
the
window
,
burst
from
*NL*
her
.
It
was
only
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
clearly
understood
*NL*
what
he
had
not
understood
when
he
led
her
out
of
the
church
after
the
*NL*
wedding
.
He
felt
now
that
he
was
not
simply
close
to
her
,
but
that
he
*NL*
did
not
know
where
he
ended
and
she
began
.
He
felt
this
from
the
*NL*
agonizing
sensation
of
division
that
he
experienced
at
that
instant
.
He
*NL*
was
offended
for
the
first
instant
,
but
the
very
same
second
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
could
not
be
offended
by
her
,
that
she
was
himself
.
He
felt
for
*NL*
the
first
moment
as
a
man
feels
when
,
having
suddenly
received
a
violent
*NL*
blow
from
behind
,
he
turns
round
,
angry
and
eager
to
avenge
himself
,
to
*NL*
look
for
his
antagonist
,
and
finds
that
it
is
he
himself
who
has
*NL*
accidentally
struck
himself
,
that
there
is
no
one
to
be
angry
with
,
and
*NL*
that
he
must
put
up
with
and
try
to
soothe
the
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
afterwards
did
he
feel
it
with
such
intensity
,
but
this
first
time
*NL*
he
could
not
for
a
long
while
get
over
it
.
His
natural
feeling
urged
him
*NL*
to
defend
himself
,
to
prove
to
her
she
was
wrong
;
but
to
prove
her
wrong
*NL*
would
mean
irritating
her
still
more
and
making
the
rupture
greater
that
*NL*
was
the
cause
of
all
his
suffering
.
One
habitual
feeling
impelled
him
to
*NL*
get
rid
of
the
blame
and
to
pass
it
on
to
her
.
Another
feeling
,
even
*NL*
stronger
,
impelled
him
as
quickly
as
possible
to
smooth
over
the
rupture
*NL*
without
letting
it
grow
greater
.
To
remain
under
such
undeserved
*NL*
reproach
was
wretched
,
but
to
make
her
suffer
by
justifying
himself
was
*NL*
worse
still
.
Like
a
man
half-awake
in
an
agony
of
pain
,
he
wanted
to
*NL*
tear
out
,
to
fling
away
the
aching
place
,
and
coming
to
his
senses
,
he
*NL*
felt
that
the
aching
place
was
himself
.
He
could
do
nothing
but
try
to
*NL*
help
the
aching
place
to
bear
it
,
and
this
he
tried
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
peace
.
She
,
recognizing
that
she
was
wrong
,
though
she
did
not
*NL*
say
so
,
became
tenderer
to
him
,
and
they
experienced
new
,
redoubled
*NL*
happiness
in
their
love
.
But
that
did
not
prevent
such
quarrels
from
*NL*
happening
again
,
and
exceedingly
often
too
,
on
the
most
unexpected
and
*NL*
trivial
grounds
.
These
quarrels
frequently
arose
from
the
fact
that
they
*NL*
did
not
yet
know
what
was
of
importance
to
each
other
and
that
all
this
*NL*
early
period
they
were
both
often
in
a
bad
temper
.
When
one
was
in
a
*NL*
good
temper
,
and
the
other
in
a
bad
temper
,
the
peace
was
not
broken
;
*NL*
but
when
both
happened
to
be
in
an
ill-humor
,
quarrels
sprang
up
from
*NL*
such
incomprehensibly
trifling
causes
,
that
they
could
never
remember
*NL*
afterwards
what
they
had
quarreled
about
.
It
is
true
that
when
they
were
*NL*
both
in
a
good
temper
their
enjoyment
of
life
was
redoubled
.
But
still
*NL*
this
first
period
of
their
married
life
was
a
difficult
time
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
early
time
they
had
a
peculiarly
vivid
sense
of
tension
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
a
tugging
in
opposite
directions
of
the
chain
by
which
they
*NL*
were
bound
.
Altogether
their
honeymoon
--
that
is
to
say
,
the
month
after
*NL*
their
wedding
--
from
which
from
tradition
Levin
expected
so
much
,
was
not
*NL*
merely
not
a
time
of
sweetness
,
but
remained
in
the
memories
of
both
as
*NL*
the
bitterest
and
most
humiliating
period
in
their
lives
.
They
both
*NL*
alike
tried
in
later
life
to
blot
out
from
their
memories
all
the
*NL*
monstrous
,
shameful
incidents
of
that
morbid
period
,
when
both
were
*NL*
rarely
in
a
normal
frame
of
mind
,
both
were
rarely
quite
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
in
the
third
month
of
their
married
life
,
after
their
return
*NL*
from
Moscow
,
where
they
had
been
staying
for
a
month
,
that
their
life
*NL*
began
to
go
more
smoothly
.

*NL*
They
had
just
come
back
from
Moscow
,
and
were
glad
to
be
alone
.
He
was
*NL*
sitting
at
the
writing
table
in
his
study
,
writing
.
She
,
wearing
the
*NL*
dark
lilac
dress
she
had
worn
during
the
first
days
of
their
married
*NL*
life
,
and
put
on
again
today
,
a
dress
particularly
remembered
and
loved
*NL*
by
him
,
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
the
same
old-fashioned
leather
sofa
*NL*
which
had
always
stood
in
the
study
in
Levin
's
father
's
and
*NL*
grandfather
's
days
.
She
was
sewing
at
_
broderie
anglaise
_
.
He
thought
*NL*
and
wrote
,
never
losing
the
happy
consciousness
of
her
presence
.
His
*NL*
work
,
both
on
the
land
and
on
the
book
,
in
which
the
principles
of
the
*NL*
new
land
system
were
to
be
laid
down
,
had
not
been
abandoned
;
but
just
*NL*
as
formerly
these
pursuits
and
ideas
had
seemed
to
him
petty
and
trivial
*NL*
in
comparison
with
the
darkness
that
overspread
all
life
,
now
they
*NL*
seemed
as
unimportant
and
petty
in
comparison
with
the
life
that
lay
*NL*
before
him
suffused
with
the
brilliant
light
of
happiness
.
He
went
on
*NL*
with
his
work
,
but
he
felt
now
that
the
center
of
gravity
of
his
*NL*
attention
had
passed
to
something
else
,
and
that
consequently
he
looked
*NL*
at
his
work
quite
differently
and
more
clearly
.
Formerly
this
work
had
*NL*
been
for
him
an
escape
from
life
.
Formerly
he
had
felt
that
without
this
*NL*
work
his
life
would
be
too
gloomy
.
Now
these
pursuits
were
necessary
for
*NL*
him
that
life
might
not
be
too
uniformly
bright
.
Taking
up
his
*NL*
manuscript
,
reading
through
what
he
had
written
,
he
found
with
pleasure
*NL*
that
the
work
was
worth
his
working
at
.
Many
of
his
old
ideas
seemed
to
*NL*
him
superfluous
and
extreme
,
but
many
blanks
became
distinct
to
him
when
*NL*
he
reviewed
the
whole
thing
in
his
memory
.
He
was
writing
now
a
new
*NL*
chapter
on
the
causes
of
the
present
disastrous
condition
of
agriculture
*NL*
in
Russia
.
He
maintained
that
the
poverty
of
Russia
arises
not
merely
*NL*
from
the
anomalous
distribution
of
landed
property
and
misdirected
*NL*
reforms
,
but
that
what
had
contributed
of
late
years
to
this
result
was
*NL*
the
civilization
from
without
abnormally
grafted
upon
Russia
,
especially
*NL*
facilities
of
communication
,
as
railways
,
leading
to
centralization
in
*NL*
towns
,
the
development
of
luxury
,
and
the
consequent
development
of
*NL*
manufactures
,
credit
and
its
accompaniment
of
speculation
--
all
to
the
*NL*
detriment
of
agriculture
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
in
a
normal
development
*NL*
of
wealth
in
a
state
all
these
phenomena
would
arise
only
when
a
*NL*
considerable
amount
of
labor
had
been
put
into
agriculture
,
when
it
had
*NL*
come
under
regular
,
or
at
least
definite
,
conditions
;
that
the
wealth
of
*NL*
a
country
ought
to
increase
proportionally
,
and
especially
in
such
a
way
*NL*
that
other
sources
of
wealth
should
not
outstrip
agriculture
;
that
in
*NL*
harmony
with
a
certain
stage
of
agriculture
there
should
be
means
of
*NL*
communication
corresponding
to
it
,
and
that
in
our
unsettled
condition
*NL*
of
the
land
,
railways
,
called
into
being
by
political
and
not
by
*NL*
economic
needs
,
were
premature
,
and
instead
of
promoting
agriculture
,
as
*NL*
was
expected
of
them
,
they
were
competing
with
agriculture
and
promoting
*NL*
the
development
of
manufactures
and
credit
,
and
so
arresting
its
*NL*
progress
;
and
that
just
as
the
one-sided
and
premature
development
of
*NL*
one
organ
in
an
animal
would
hinder
its
general
development
,
so
in
the
*NL*
general
development
of
wealth
in
Russia
,
credit
,
facilities
of
*NL*
communication
,
manufacturing
activity
,
indubitably
necessary
in
Europe
,
*NL*
where
they
had
arisen
in
their
proper
time
,
had
with
us
only
done
harm
,
*NL*
by
throwing
into
the
background
the
chief
question
calling
for
*NL*
settlement
--
the
question
of
the
organization
of
agriculture
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
writing
his
ideas
she
was
thinking
how
unnaturally
cordial
*NL*
her
husband
had
been
to
young
Prince
Tcharsky
,
who
had
,
with
great
want
*NL*
of
tact
,
flirted
with
her
the
day
before
they
left
Moscow
.
``
He
's
*NL*
jealous
,
''
she
thought
.
``
Goodness
!
how
sweet
and
silly
he
is
!
He
's
*NL*
jealous
of
me
!
If
he
knew
that
I
think
no
more
of
them
than
of
Piotr
the
*NL*
cook
,
''
she
thought
,
looking
at
his
head
and
red
neck
with
a
feeling
of
*NL*
possession
strange
to
herself
.
``
Though
it
's
a
pity
to
take
him
from
his
*NL*
work
-LRB-
but
he
has
plenty
of
time
!
-RRB-
,
I
must
look
at
his
face
;
will
he
feel
*NL*
I
'm
looking
at
him
?
I
wish
he
'd
turn
round
...
I
'll
_
will
_
him
to
!
''
and
*NL*
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
,
as
though
to
intensify
the
influence
of
her
*NL*
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
draw
away
all
the
sap
and
give
a
false
appearance
of
*NL*
prosperity
,
''
he
muttered
,
stopping
to
write
,
and
,
feeling
that
she
was
*NL*
looking
at
him
and
smiling
,
he
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
queried
,
smiling
,
and
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looked
round
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
;
I
wanted
you
to
look
round
,
''
she
said
,
watching
him
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
guess
whether
he
was
vexed
at
being
interrupted
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
happy
we
are
alone
together
!
--
I
am
,
that
is
,
''
he
said
,
going
up
to
*NL*
her
with
a
radiant
smile
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
just
as
happy
.
I
'll
never
go
anywhere
,
especially
not
to
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
were
you
thinking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
was
thinking
...
No
,
no
,
go
along
,
go
on
writing
;
do
n't
break
*NL*
off
,
''
she
said
,
pursing
up
her
lips
,
``
and
I
must
cut
out
these
little
*NL*
holes
now
,
do
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
her
scissors
and
began
cutting
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
tell
me
,
what
was
it
?
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
beside
her
and
*NL*
watching
the
tiny
scissors
moving
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
what
was
I
thinking
about
?
I
was
thinking
about
Moscow
,
about
the
*NL*
back
of
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
,
of
all
people

have
such
happiness

It
's
unnatural

too
*NL*
good

he
said
,
kissing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
quite
the
opposite

the
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
got
a
little
curl
loose

''
he
said
,
carefully
turning
her
*NL*
head
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
curl
,
oh
yes

No

no
,
we
are
busy
at
our
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
Work
did
not
progress
further
,
and
they
darted
apart
from
one
another
*NL*
like
culprits
when
Kouzma
came
in
to
announce
that
tea
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
come
from
the
town
?
''
Levin
asked
Kouzma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
just
come
;
they
're
unpacking
the
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
quickly
,
''
she
said
to
him
as
she
went
out
of
the
study
,
``
or
else
I
*NL*
shall
read
your
letters
without
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
after
putting
his
manuscripts
together
in
the
new
portfolio
*NL*
bought
by
her
,
he
washed
his
hands
at
the
new
washstand
with
the
elegant
*NL*
fittings
,
that
had
all
made
their
appearance
with
her
.
Levin
smiled
at
*NL*
his
own
thoughts
,
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
at
those
thoughts
;
a
*NL*
feeling
akin
to
remorse
fretted
him
.
There
was
something
shameful
,
*NL*
effeminate
,
Capuan
,
as
he
called
it
to
himself
,
in
his
present
mode
of
*NL*
life
.
``
It
's
not
right
to
go
on
like
this
,
''
he
thought
.
``
It
'll
soon
be
*NL*
three
months
,
and
I
'm
doing
next
to
nothing
.
Today
,
almost
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
I
set
to
work
seriously
,
and
what
happened
?
I
did
nothing
but
*NL*
begin
and
throw
it
aside
.
Even
my
ordinary
pursuits
I
have
almost
given
*NL*
up
.
On
the
land
I
scarcely
walk
or
drive
about
at
all
to
look
after
*NL*
things
.
Either
I
am
loath
to
leave
her
,
or
I
see
she
's
dull
alone
.
And
I
*NL*
used
to
think
that
,
before
marriage
,
life
was
nothing
much
,
somehow
*NL*
did
n't
count
,
but
that
after
marriage
,
life
began
in
earnest
.
And
here
*NL*
almost
three
months
have
passed
,
and
I
have
spent
my
time
so
idly
and
*NL*
unprofitably
.
No
,
this
wo
n't
do
;
I
must
begin
.
Of
course
,
it
's
not
her
*NL*
fault
.
She
's
not
to
blame
in
any
way
.
I
ought
myself
to
be
firmer
,
to
*NL*
maintain
my
masculine
independence
of
action
;
or
else
I
shall
get
into
*NL*
such
ways
,
and
she
'll
get
used
to
them
too
...
Of
course
she
's
not
to
*NL*
blame
,
''
he
told
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
hard
for
anyone
who
is
dissatisfied
not
to
blame
someone
else
,
*NL*
and
especially
the
person
nearest
of
all
to
him
,
for
the
ground
of
his
*NL*
dissatisfaction
.
And
it
vaguely
came
into
Levin
's
mind
that
she
herself
*NL*
was
not
to
blame
-LRB-
she
could
not
be
to
blame
for
anything
-RRB-
,
but
what
was
*NL*
to
blame
was
her
education
,
too
superficial
and
frivolous
.
-LRB-
``
That
fool
*NL*
Tcharsky
:
she
wanted
,
I
know
,
to
stop
him
,
but
did
n't
know
how
to
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
``
Yes
,
apart
from
her
interest
in
the
house
-LRB-
that
she
has
-RRB-
,
apart
from
*NL*
dress
and
_
broderie
anglaise
_
,
she
has
no
serious
interests
.
No
interest
*NL*
in
her
work
,
in
the
estate
,
in
the
peasants
,
nor
in
music
,
though
she
's
*NL*
rather
good
at
it
,
nor
in
reading
.
She
does
nothing
,
and
is
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
.
''
Levin
,
in
his
heart
,
censured
this
,
and
did
not
as
yet
*NL*
understand
that
she
was
preparing
for
that
period
of
activity
which
was
*NL*
to
come
for
her
when
she
would
at
once
be
the
wife
of
her
husband
and
*NL*
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
would
bear
,
and
nurse
,
and
bring
up
children
.
*NL*
He
knew
not
that
she
was
instinctively
aware
of
this
,
and
preparing
*NL*
herself
for
this
time
of
terrible
toil
,
did
not
reproach
herself
for
the
*NL*
moments
of
carelessness
and
happiness
in
her
love
that
she
enjoyed
now
*NL*
while
gaily
building
her
nest
for
the
future

When
Levin
went
upstairs

his
wife
was
sitting
near
the
new
silver
*NL*
samovar
behind
the
new
tea
service
,
and
,
having
settled
old
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
at
a
little
table
with
a
full
cup
of
tea
,
was
reading
a
letter
*NL*
from
Dolly
,
with
whom
they
were
in
continual
and
frequent
*NL*
correspondence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
your
good
lady
's
settled
me
here
,
told
me
to
sit
a
bit
with
*NL*
her
,
''
said
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
smiling
affectionately
at
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
words
of
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
Levin
read
the
final
act
of
the
*NL*
drama
which
had
been
enacted
of
late
between
her
and
Kitty
.
He
saw
that
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
feelings
being
hurt
by
a
new
mistress
*NL*
taking
the
reins
of
government
out
of
her
hands
,
Kitty
had
yet
conquered
*NL*
her
and
made
her
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
I
opened
your
letter
too
,
''
said
Kitty
,
handing
him
an
illiterate
*NL*
letter
.
``
It
's
from
that
woman
,
I
think
,
your
brother
's
...
''
she
said
.
``
I
*NL*
did
not
read
it
through
.
This
is
from
my
people
and
from
Dolly
.
Fancy
!
*NL*
Dolly
took
Tanya
and
Grisha
to
a
children
's
ball
at
the
Sarmatskys
'
:
*NL*
Tanya
was
a
French
marquise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
did
not
hear
her
.
Flushing
,
he
took
the
letter
from
Marya
*NL*
Nikolaevna
,
his
brother
's
former
mistress
,
and
began
to
read
it
.
This
*NL*
was
the
second
letter
he
had
received
from
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
In
the
*NL*
first
letter
,
Marya
Nikolaevna
wrote
that
his
brother
had
sent
her
away
*NL*
for
no
fault
of
hers
,
and
,
with
touching
simplicity
,
added
that
though
*NL*
she
was
in
want
again
,
she
asked
for
nothing
,
and
wished
for
nothing
,
*NL*
but
was
only
tormented
by
the
thought
that
Nikolay
Dmitrievitch
would
*NL*
come
to
grief
without
her
,
owing
to
the
weak
state
of
his
health
,
and
*NL*
begged
his
brother
to
look
after
him
.
Now
she
wrote
quite
differently
.
*NL*
She
had
found
Nikolay
Dmitrievitch
,
had
again
made
it
up
with
him
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
had
moved
with
him
to
a
provincial
town
,
where
he
had
*NL*
received
a
post
in
the
government
service
.
But
that
he
had
quarreled
*NL*
with
the
head
official
,
and
was
on
his
way
back
to
Moscow
,
only
he
had
*NL*
been
taken
so
ill
on
the
road
that
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
ever
*NL*
leave
his
bed
again
,
she
wrote
.
``
It
's
always
of
you
he
has
talked
,
and
,
*NL*
besides
,
he
has
no
more
money
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
this
;
Dolly
writes
about
you
,
''
Kitty
was
beginning
,
with
a
smile
;
*NL*
but
she
stopped
suddenly
,
noticing
the
changed
expression
on
her
*NL*
husband
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
writes
to
me
that
Nikolay
,
my
brother
,
is
at
death
's
door
.
I
shall
*NL*
go
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
face
changed
at
once
.
Thoughts
of
Tanya
as
a
marquise
,
of
Dolly
,
*NL*
all
had
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
going
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
will
go
with
you
,
can
I
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
!
What
are
you
thinking
of
?
''
he
said
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
offended
that
he
should
seem
to
take
her
suggestion
*NL*
unwillingly
and
with
vexation
.
``
Why
should
n't
I
go
?
I
sha
n't
be
in
your
*NL*
way
.
I.
.
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
because
my
brother
is
dying
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
Why
should
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
For
the
same
reason
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
at
a
moment
of
such
gravity
for
me
,
she
only
thinks
of
her
being
*NL*
dull
by
herself
,
''
thought
Levin
.
And
this
lack
of
candor
in
a
matter
of
*NL*
such
gravity
infuriated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
out
of
the
question
,
''
he
said
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
seeing
that
it
was
coming
to
a
quarrel
,
gently
put
*NL*
down
her
cup
and
withdrew
.
Kitty
did
not
even
notice
her
.
The
tone
in
*NL*
which
her
husband
had
said
the
last
words
wounded
her
,
especially
*NL*
because
he
evidently
did
not
believe
what
she
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
that
if
you
go
,
I
shall
come
with
you
;
I
shall
certainly
*NL*
come

''
she
said
hastily
and
wrathfully
.
``
Why
out
of
the
question
?
Why
do
*NL*
you
say
it
's
out
of
the
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
'll
be
going
God
knows
where
,
by
all
sorts
of
roads
and
to
*NL*
all
sorts
of
hotels
.
You
would
be
a
hindrance
to
me

''
said
Levin
,
trying
*NL*
to
be
cool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
I
do
n't
want
anything

Where
you

I
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Kitty
!
Do
n't
get
angry

But
just
think
a
little
:
this
is
a
matter
of
*NL*
such
importance
that
I
ca
n't
bear
to
think
that
you
should
bring
in
a
*NL*
feeling
of
weakness
,
of
dislike
to
being
left
alone

Come
,
you
'll
be
*NL*
dull
alone

so
go
and
stay
at
Moscow
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
always
ascribe
base
,
vile
motives
to
me
,

she
said
with
*NL*
tears
of
wounded
pride
and
fury
.
``
I
did
n't
mean

it
was
n't
weakness

it
*NL*
was
n't

I
feel
that
it
's
my
duty
to
be
with
my
husband
when
he
's
in
*NL*
trouble
,
but
you
try
on
purpose
to
hurt
me

you
try
on
purpose
not
to
*NL*
understand
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
this
is
awful
!
To
be
such
a
slave
!
''
cried
Levin
,
getting
up
,
and
*NL*
unable
to
restrain
his
anger
any
longer
.
But
at
the
same
second
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
beating
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
marry
?
You
could
have
been
free
.
Why
did
you
,
if
you
*NL*
regret
it
?
''
she
said
,
getting
up
and
running
away
into
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
to
her
,
she
was
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
speak
,
trying
to
find
words
not
to
dissuade
but
simply
to
*NL*
soothe
her
.
But
she
did
not
heed
him
,
and
would
not
agree
to
anything
.
*NL*
He
bent
down
to
her
and
took
her
hand
,
which
resisted
him
.
He
kissed
her
*NL*
hand
,
kissed
her
hair
,
kissed
her
hand
again
--
still
she
was
silent
.
But
*NL*
when
he
took
her
face
in
both
his
hands
and
said
``
Kitty
!
''
she
suddenly
*NL*
recovered
herself
,
and
began
to
cry
,
and
they
were
reconciled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
decided
that
they
should
go
together
the
next
day
.
Levin
told
his
*NL*
wife
that
he
believed
she
wanted
to
go
simply
in
order
to
be
of
use
,
*NL*
agreed
that
Marya
Nikolaevna
's
being
with
his
brother
did
not
make
her
*NL*
going
improper
,
but
he
set
off
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
dissatisfied
*NL*
both
with
her
and
with
himself
.
He
was
dissatisfied
with
her
for
being
*NL*
unable
to
make
up
her
mind
to
let
him
go
when
it
was
necessary
-LRB-
and
how
*NL*
strange
it
was
for
him
to
think
that
he
,
so
lately
hardly
daring
to
*NL*
believe
in
such
happiness
as
that
she
could
love
him
--
now
was
unhappy
*NL*
because
she
loved
him
too
much
!
-RRB-
,
and
he
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
*NL*
for
not
showing
more
strength
of
will
.
Even
greater
was
the
feeling
of
*NL*
disagreement
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
as
to
her
not
needing
to
*NL*
consider
the
woman
who
was
with
his
brother
,
and
he
thought
with
horror
*NL*
of
all
the
contingencies
they
might
meet
with
.
The
mere
idea
of
his
*NL*
wife
,
his
Kitty
,
being
in
the
same
room
with
a
common
wench
,
set
him
*NL*
shuddering
with
horror
and
loathing
.

Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
hotel
of
the
provincial
town
where
Nikolay
Levin
was
lying
ill
was
*NL*
one
of
those
provincial
hotels
which
are
constructed
on
the
newest
model
*NL*
of
modern
improvements
,
with
the
best
intentions
of
cleanliness
,
*NL*
comfort
,
and
even
elegance
,
but
owing
to
the
public
that
patronizes
*NL*
them
,
are
with
astounding
rapidity
transformed
into
filthy
taverns
with
*NL*
a
pretension
of
modern
improvement
that
only
makes
them
worse
than
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
,
honestly
filthy
hotels
.
This
hotel
had
already
reached
*NL*
that
stage
,
and
the
soldier
in
a
filthy
uniform
smoking
in
the
entry
,
*NL*
supposed
to
stand
for
a
hall-porter
,
and
the
cast-iron
,
slippery
,
dark
,
*NL*
and
disagreeable
staircase
,
and
the
free
and
easy
waiter
in
a
filthy
*NL*
frock
coat
,
and
the
common
dining
room
with
a
dusty
bouquet
of
wax
*NL*
flowers
adorning
the
table
,
and
filth
,
dust
,
and
disorder
everywhere
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
the
sort
of
modern
up-to-date
self-complacent
*NL*
railway
uneasiness
of
this
hotel
,
aroused
a
most
painful
feeling
in
*NL*
Levin
after
their
fresh
young
life
,
especially
because
the
impression
of
*NL*
falsity
made
by
the
hotel
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
what
awaited
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
invariably
the
case
,
after
they
had
been
asked
at
what
price
they
*NL*
wanted
rooms
,
it
appeared
that
there
was
not
one
decent
room
for
them
;
*NL*
one
decent
room
had
been
taken
by
the
inspector
of
railroads
,
another
by
*NL*
a
lawyer
from
Moscow
,
a
third
by
Princess
Astafieva
from
the
country
.
*NL*
There
remained
only
one
filthy
room
,
next
to
which
they
promised
that
*NL*
another
should
be
empty
by
the
evening
.
Feeling
angry
with
his
wife
*NL*
because
what
he
had
expected
had
come
to
pass
,
which
was
that
at
the
*NL*
moment
of
arrival
,
when
his
heart
throbbed
with
emotion
and
anxiety
to
*NL*
know
how
his
brother
was
getting
on
,
he
should
have
to
be
seeing
after
*NL*
her
,
instead
of
rushing
straight
to
his
brother
,
Levin
conducted
her
to
*NL*
the
room
assigned
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
do
go
!
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
with
timid
and
guilty
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
of
the
door
without
a
word
,
and
at
once
stumbled
over
Marya
*NL*
Nikolaevna
,
who
had
heard
of
his
arrival
and
had
not
dared
to
go
in
to
*NL*
see
him
.
She
was
just
the
same
as
when
he
saw
her
in
Moscow
;
the
same
*NL*
woolen
gown
,
and
bare
arms
and
neck
,
and
the
same
good-naturedly
stupid
,
*NL*
pockmarked
face
,
only
a
little
plumper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
he
?
how
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
bad
.
He
ca
n't
get
up
.
He
has
kept
expecting
you
.
He
...
Are
you
*NL*
...
with
your
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
for
the
first
moment
understand
what
it
was
confused
her
,
*NL*
but
she
immediately
enlightened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
away
.
I
'll
go
down
to
the
kitchen
,
''
she
brought
out
.
``
Nikolay
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
will
be
delighted
.
He
heard
about
it
,
and
knows
your
lady
,
*NL*
and
remembers
her
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
realized
that
she
meant
his
wife
,
and
did
not
know
what
answer
to
*NL*
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
come
along
to
him
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
he
moved
,
the
door
of
his
room
opened
and
Kitty
peeped
*NL*
out
.
Levin
crimsoned
both
from
shame
and
anger
with
his
wife
,
who
had
*NL*
put
herself
and
him
in
such
a
difficult
position
;
but
Marya
Nikolaevna
*NL*
crimsoned
still
more
.
She
positively
shrank
together
and
flushed
to
the
*NL*
point
of
tears
,
and
clutching
the
ends
of
her
apron
in
both
hands
,
*NL*
twisted
them
in
her
red
fingers
without
knowing
what
to
say
and
what
to
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
instant
Levin
saw
an
expression
of
eager
curiosity
in
the
*NL*
eyes
with
which
Kitty
looked
at
this
awful
woman
,
so
incomprehensible
to
*NL*
her
;
but
it
lasted
only
a
single
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
how
is
he
?
''
she
turned
to
her
husband
and
then
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
one
ca
n't
go
on
talking
in
the
passage
like
this
!
''
Levin
said
,
*NL*
looking
angrily
at
a
gentleman
who
walked
jauntily
at
that
instant
*NL*
across
the
corridor
,
as
though
about
his
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
come
in
,
''
said
Kitty
,
turning
to
Marya
Nikolaevna
,
who
had
*NL*
recovered
herself
,
but
noticing
her
husband
's
face
of
dismay
,
``
or
go
on
;
*NL*
go
,
and
then
come
for
me
,
''
she
said
,
and
went
back
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
to
his
brother
's
room
.
He
had
not
in
the
least
expected
what
*NL*
he
saw
and
felt
in
his
brother
's
room
.
He
had
expected
to
find
him
in
*NL*
the
same
state
of
self-deception
which
he
had
heard
was
so
frequent
with
*NL*
the
consumptive
,
and
which
had
struck
him
so
much
during
his
brother
's
*NL*
visit
in
the
autumn
.
He
had
expected
to
find
the
physical
signs
of
the
*NL*
approach
of
death
more
marked
--
greater
weakness
,
greater
emaciation
,
but
*NL*
still
almost
the
same
condition
of
things
.
He
had
expected
himself
to
*NL*
feel
the
same
distress
at
the
loss
of
the
brother
he
loved
and
the
same
*NL*
horror
in
face
of
death
as
he
had
felt
then
,
only
in
a
greater
degree
.
*NL*
And
he
had
prepared
himself
for
this
;
but
he
found
something
utterly
*NL*
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
dirty
room
with
the
painted
panels
of
its
walls
filthy
with
*NL*
spittle
,
and
conversation
audible
through
the
thin
partition
from
the
*NL*
next
room
,
in
a
stifling
atmosphere
saturated
with
impurities
,
on
a
*NL*
bedstead
moved
away
from
the
wall
,
there
lay
covered
with
a
quilt
,
a
*NL*
body
.
One
arm
of
this
body
was
above
the
quilt
,
and
the
wrist
,
huge
as
a
*NL*
rake-handle
,
was
attached
,
inconceivably
it
seemed
,
to
the
thin
,
long
*NL*
bone
of
the
arm
smooth
from
the
beginning
to
the
middle
.
The
head
lay
*NL*
sideways
on
the
pillow
.
Levin
could
see
the
scanty
locks
wet
with
sweat
*NL*
on
the
temples
and
tense
,
transparent-looking
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
that
that
fearful
body
was
my
brother
Nikolay
?
''
thought
*NL*
Levin
.
But
he
went
closer
,
saw
the
face
,
and
doubt
became
impossible
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
the
terrible
change
in
the
face
,
Levin
had
only
to
glance
at
*NL*
those
eager
eyes
raised
at
his
approach
,
only
to
catch
the
faint
*NL*
movement
of
the
mouth
under
the
sticky
mustache
,
to
realize
the
terrible
*NL*
truth
that
this
death-like
body
was
his
living
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glittering
eyes
looked
sternly
and
reproachfully
at
his
brother
as
*NL*
he
drew
near
.
And
immediately
this
glance
established
a
living
*NL*
relationship
between
living
men
.
Levin
immediately
felt
the
reproach
in
*NL*
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
and
felt
remorse
at
his
own
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Konstantin
took
him
by
the
hand
,
Nikolay
smiled
.
The
smile
was
*NL*
faint
,
scarcely
perceptible
,
and
in
spite
of
the
smile
the
stern
*NL*
expression
of
the
eyes
was
unchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
not
expect
to
find
me
like
this
,
''
he
articulated
with
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
no
,
''
said
Levin
,
hesitating
over
his
words
.
``
How
was
it
you
*NL*
did
n't
let
me
know
before
,
that
is
,
at
the
time
of
my
wedding
?
I
made
*NL*
inquiries
in
all
directions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
talk
so
as
not
to
be
silent
,
and
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
*NL*
especially
as
his
brother
made
no
reply
,
and
simply
stared
without
*NL*
dropping
his
eyes
,
and
evidently
penetrated
to
the
inner
meaning
of
each
*NL*
word
.
Levin
told
his
brother
that
his
wife
had
come
with
him
.
Nikolay
*NL*
expressed
pleasure
,
but
said
he
was
afraid
of
frightening
her
by
his
*NL*
condition
.
A
silence
followed
.
Suddenly
Nikolay
stirred
,
and
began
to
*NL*
say
something
.
Levin
expected
something
of
peculiar
gravity
and
*NL*
importance
from
the
expression
of
his
face
,
but
Nikolay
began
speaking
*NL*
of
his
health
.
He
found
fault
with
the
doctor
,
regretting
he
had
not
a
*NL*
celebrated
Moscow
doctor
.
Levin
saw
that
he
still
hoped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seizing
the
first
moment
of
silence
,
Levin
got
up
,
anxious
to
escape
,
if
*NL*
only
for
an
instant
,
from
his
agonizing
emotion
,
and
said
that
he
would
*NL*
go
and
fetch
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
and
I
'll
tell
her
to
tidy
up
here
.
It
's
dirty
and
stinking
*NL*
here
,
I
expect
.
Marya
!
clear
up
the
room
,
''
the
sick
man
said
with
*NL*
effort
.
``
Oh
,
and
when
you
've
cleared
up
,
go
away
yourself
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
looking
inquiringly
at
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
made
no
answer
.
Going
out
into
the
corridor
,
he
stopped
short
.
He
*NL*
had
said
he
would
fetch
his
wife
,
but
now
,
taking
stock
of
the
emotion
*NL*
he
was
feeling
,
he
decided
that
he
would
try
on
the
contrary
to
persuade
*NL*
her
not
to
go
in
to
the
sick
man
.
``
Why
should
she
suffer
as
I
am
*NL*
suffering
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
he
?
''
Kitty
asked
with
a
frightened
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
awful
,
it
's
awful
!
What
did
you
come
for
?
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
,
looking
timidly
and
ruefully
at
her
*NL*
husband
;
then
she
went
up
and
took
him
by
the
elbow
with
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
!
take
me
to
him
;
it
will
be
easier
for
us
to
bear
it
together
.
*NL*
You
only
take
me
,
take
me
to
him
,
please
,
and
go
away
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
*NL*
must
understand
that
for
me
to
see
you
,
and
not
to
see
him
,
is
far
more
*NL*
painful
.
There
I
might
be
a
help
to
you
and
to
him
.
Please
,
let
me
!
''
she
*NL*
besought
her
husband
,
as
though
the
happiness
of
her
life
depended
on
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
obliged
to
agree
,
and
regaining
his
composure
,
and
completely
*NL*
forgetting
about
Marya
Nikolaevna
by
now
,
he
went
again
in
to
his
*NL*
brother
with
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepping
lightly
,
and
continually
glancing
at
her
husband
,
showing
him
a
*NL*
valorous
and
sympathetic
face
,
Kitty
went
into
the
sick-room
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
without
haste
,
noiselessly
closed
the
door
.
With
inaudible
steps
*NL*
she
went
quickly
to
the
sick
man
's
bedside
,
and
going
up
so
that
he
had
*NL*
not
to
turn
his
head
,
she
immediately
clasped
in
her
fresh
young
hand
*NL*
the
skeleton
of
his
huge
hand
,
pressed
it
,
and
began
speaking
with
that
*NL*
soft
eagerness
,
sympathetic
and
not
jarring
,
which
is
peculiar
to
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
met
,
though
we
were
not
acquainted
,
at
Soden
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
*NL*
never
thought
I
was
to
be
your
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
not
have
recognized
me
?
''
he
said
,
with
a
radiant
smile
at
her
*NL*
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
should
.
What
a
good
thing
you
let
us
know
!
Not
a
day
has
passed
*NL*
that
Kostya
has
not
mentioned
you
,
and
been
anxious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
sick
man
's
interest
did
not
last
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
had
finished
speaking
,
there
had
come
back
into
his
face
the
*NL*
stern
,
reproachful
expression
of
the
dying
man
's
envy
of
the
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
are
not
quite
comfortable
here
,
''
she
said
,
turning
away
*NL*
from
his
fixed
stare
,
and
looking
about
the
room
.
``
We
must
ask
about
*NL*
another
room
,
''
she
said
to
her
husband
,
``
so
that
we
might
be
nearer
.

Chapter
18
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
could
not
look
calmly
at
his
brother
;
he
could
not
himself
be
*NL*
natural
and
calm
in
his
presence
.
When
he
went
in
to
the
sick
man
,
his
*NL*
eyes
and
his
attention
were
unconsciously
dimmed
,
and
he
did
not
see
and
*NL*
did
not
distinguish
the
details
of
his
brother
's
position
.
He
smelt
the
*NL*
awful
odor
,
saw
the
dirt
,
disorder
,
and
miserable
condition
,
and
heard
*NL*
the
groans
,
and
felt
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
help
.
It
never
*NL*
entered
his
head
to
analyze
the
details
of
the
sick
man
's
situation
,
to
*NL*
consider
how
that
body
was
lying
under
the
quilt
,
how
those
emaciated
*NL*
legs
and
thighs
and
spine
were
lying
huddled
up
,
and
whether
they
could
*NL*
not
be
made
more
comfortable
,
whether
anything
could
not
be
done
to
make
*NL*
things
,
if
not
better
,
at
least
less
bad
.
It
made
his
blood
run
cold
*NL*
when
he
began
to
think
of
all
these
details
.
He
was
absolutely
convinced
*NL*
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
prolong
his
brother
's
life
or
to
relieve
*NL*
his
suffering
.
But
a
sense
of
his
regarding
all
aid
as
out
of
the
*NL*
question
was
felt
by
the
sick
man
,
and
exasperated
him
.
And
this
made
it
*NL*
still
more
painful
for
Levin
.
To
be
in
the
sick-room
was
agony
to
him
,
*NL*
not
to
be
there
still
worse
.
And
he
was
continually
,
on
various
*NL*
pretexts
,
going
out
of
the
room
,
and
coming
in
again
,
because
he
was
*NL*
unable
to
remain
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kitty
thought
,
and
felt
,
and
acted
quite
differently
.
On
seeing
the
*NL*
sick
man
,
she
pitied
him
.
And
pity
in
her
womanly
heart
did
not
arouse
*NL*
at
all
that
feeling
of
horror
and
loathing
that
it
aroused
in
her
*NL*
husband
,
but
a
desire
to
act
,
to
find
out
all
the
details
of
his
state
,
*NL*
and
to
remedy
them
.
And
since
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
it
*NL*
was
her
duty
to
help
him
,
she
had
no
doubt
either
that
it
was
possible
,
*NL*
and
immediately
set
to
work
.
The
very
details
,
the
mere
thought
of
which
*NL*
reduced
her
husband
to
terror
,
immediately
engaged
her
attention
.
She
*NL*
sent
for
the
doctor
,
sent
to
the
chemist
's
,
set
the
maid
who
had
come
*NL*
with
her
and
Marya
Nikolaevna
to
sweep
and
dust
and
scrub
;
she
herself
*NL*
washed
up
something
,
washed
out
something
else
,
laid
something
under
the
*NL*
quilt
.
Something
was
by
her
directions
brought
into
the
sick-room
,
*NL*
something
else
was
carried
out
.
She
herself
went
several
times
to
her
*NL*
room
,
regardless
of
the
men
she
met
in
the
corridor
,
got
out
and
brought
*NL*
in
sheets
,
pillow
cases
,
towels
,
and
shirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
,
who
was
busy
with
a
party
of
engineers
dining
in
the
dining
*NL*
hall
,
came
several
times
with
an
irate
countenance
in
answer
to
her
*NL*
summons
,
and
could
not
avoid
carrying
out
her
orders
,
as
she
gave
them
*NL*
with
such
gracious
insistence
that
there
was
no
evading
her
.
Levin
did
*NL*
not
approve
of
all
this
;
he
did
not
believe
it
would
be
of
any
good
to
*NL*
the
patient
.
Above
all
,
he
feared
the
patient
would
be
angry
at
it
.
But
*NL*
the
sick
man
,
though
he
seemed
and
was
indifferent
about
it
,
was
not
*NL*
angry
,
but
only
abashed
,
and
on
the
whole
as
it
were
interested
in
what
*NL*
she
was
doing
with
him
.
Coming
back
from
the
doctor
to
whom
Kitty
had
*NL*
sent
him
,
Levin
,
on
opening
the
door
,
came
upon
the
sick
man
at
the
*NL*
instant
when
,
by
Kitty
's
directions
,
they
were
changing
his
linen
.
The
*NL*
long
white
ridge
of
his
spine
,
with
the
huge
,
prominent
shoulder
blades
*NL*
and
jutting
ribs
and
vertebrae
,
was
bare
,
and
Marya
Nikolaevna
and
the
*NL*
waiter
were
struggling
with
the
sleeve
of
the
night
shirt
,
and
could
not
*NL*
get
the
long
,
limp
arm
into
it
.
Kitty
,
hurriedly
closing
the
door
after
*NL*
Levin
,
was
not
looking
that
way
;
but
the
sick
man
groaned
,
and
she
moved
*NL*
rapidly
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
you
come
,
''
said
the
sick
man
angrily
.
``
I
'll
do
it
my
*NL*
myself
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
say
?
''
queried
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
But
Kitty
heard
and
saw
he
was
*NL*
ashamed
and
uncomfortable
at
being
naked
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
looking
,
I
'm
not
looking
!
''
she
said
,
putting
the
arm
in
.
``
Marya
*NL*
Nikolaevna
,
you
come
this
side
,
you
do
it
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
go
for
me
,
there
's
a
little
bottle
in
my
small
bag
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
turning
to
her
husband
,
``
you
know
,
in
the
side
pocket
;
bring
it
,
please
,
*NL*
and
meanwhile
they
'll
finish
clearing
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Returning
with
the
bottle
,
Levin
found
the
sick
man
settled
comfortably
*NL*
and
everything
about
him
completely
changed
.
The
heavy
smell
was
*NL*
replaced
by
the
smell
of
aromatic
vinegar
,
which
Kitty
with
pouting
lips
*NL*
and
puffed-out
,
rosy
cheeks
was
squirting
through
a
little
pipe
.
There
*NL*
was
no
dust
visible
anywhere
,
a
rug
was
laid
by
the
bedside
.
On
the
*NL*
table
stood
medicine
bottles
and
decanters
tidily
arranged
,
and
the
*NL*
linen
needed
was
folded
up
there
,
and
Kitty
's
_
broderie
anglaise
_
.
On
*NL*
the
other
table
by
the
patient
's
bed
there
were
candles
and
drink
and
*NL*
powders
.
The
sick
man
himself
,
washed
and
combed
,
lay
in
clean
sheets
on
*NL*
high
raised
pillows
,
in
a
clean
night-shirt
with
a
white
collar
about
*NL*
his
astoundingly
thin
neck
,
and
with
a
new
expression
of
hope
looked
*NL*
fixedly
at
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
brought
by
Levin
,
and
found
by
him
at
the
club
,
was
not
the
*NL*
one
who
had
been
attending
Nikolay
Levin
,
as
the
patient
was
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
him
.
The
new
doctor
took
up
a
stethoscope
and
sounded
*NL*
the
patient
,
shook
his
head
,
prescribed
medicine
,
and
with
extreme
*NL*
minuteness
explained
first
how
to
take
the
medicine
and
then
what
diet
*NL*
was
to
be
kept
to
.
He
advised
eggs
,
raw
or
hardly
cooked
,
and
seltzer
*NL*
water
,
with
warm
milk
at
a
certain
temperature
.
When
the
doctor
had
gone
*NL*
away
the
sick
man
said
something
to
his
brother
,
of
which
Levin
could
*NL*
distinguish
only
the
last
words
:
``
Your
Katya
.
''
By
the
expression
with
*NL*
which
he
gazed
at
her
,
Levin
saw
that
he
was
praising
her
.
He
called
*NL*
indeed
to
Katya
,
as
he
called
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
much
better
already
,
''
he
said
.
``
Why
,
with
you
I
should
have
got
*NL*
well
long
ago
.
How
nice
it
is
!
''
he
took
her
hand
and
drew
it
towards
his
*NL*
lips
,
but
as
though
afraid
she
would
dislike
it
he
changed
his
mind
,
let
*NL*
it
go
,
and
only
stroked
it
.
Kitty
took
his
hand
in
both
hers
and
pressed
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
turn
me
over
on
the
left
side
and
go
to
bed
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
could
make
out
what
he
said
but
Kitty
;
she
alone
understood
.
She
*NL*
understood
because
she
was
all
the
while
mentally
keeping
watch
on
what
*NL*
he
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
other
side
,
''
she
said
to
her
husband
,
``
he
always
sleeps
on
that
*NL*
side
.
Turn
him
over
,
it
's
so
disagreeable
calling
the
servants
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
strong
enough
.
Can
you
?
''
she
said
to
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
not
,
''
answered
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terrible
as
it
was
to
Levin
to
put
his
arms
round
that
terrible
body
,
to
*NL*
take
hold
of
that
under
the
quilt
,
of
which
he
preferred
to
know
*NL*
nothing
,
under
his
wife
's
influence
he
made
his
resolute
face
that
she
*NL*
knew
so
well
,
and
putting
his
arms
into
the
bed
took
hold
of
the
body
,
*NL*
but
in
spite
of
his
own
strength
he
was
struck
by
the
strange
heaviness
*NL*
of
those
powerless
limbs
.
While
he
was
turning
him
over
,
conscious
of
*NL*
the
huge
emaciated
arm
about
his
neck
,
Kitty
swiftly
and
noiselessly
*NL*
turned
the
pillow
,
beat
it
up
and
settled
in
it
the
sick
man
's
head
,
*NL*
smoothing
back
his
hair
,
which
was
sticking
again
to
his
moist
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
kept
his
brother
's
hand
in
his
own
.
Levin
felt
that
he
*NL*
meant
to
do
something
with
his
hand
and
was
pulling
it
somewhere
.
Levin
*NL*
yielded
with
a
sinking
heart
:
yes
,
he
drew
it
to
his
mouth
and
kissed
*NL*
it
.
Levin
,
shaking
with
sobs
and
unable
to
articulate
a
word
,
went
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
hast
hid
these
things
from
the
wise
and
prudent
,
and
hast
revealed
*NL*
them
unto
babes
.
''
So
Levin
thought
about
his
wife
as
he
talked
to
her
*NL*
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
thought
of
the
text
,
not
because
he
considered
himself
``
wise
and
*NL*
prudent
.
''
He
did
not
so
consider
himself
,
but
he
could
not
help
knowing
*NL*
that
he
had
more
intellect
than
his
wife
and
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
help
knowing
that
when
he
thought
of
death
,
he
thought
with
*NL*
all
the
force
of
his
intellect
.
He
knew
too
that
the
brains
of
many
*NL*
great
men
,
whose
thoughts
he
had
read
,
had
brooded
over
death
and
yet
*NL*
knew
not
a
hundredth
part
of
what
his
wife
and
Agafea
Mihalovna
knew
*NL*
about
it
.
Different
as
those
two
women
were
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
and
Katya
,
*NL*
as
his
brother
Nikolay
had
called
her
,
and
as
Levin
particularly
liked
*NL*
to
call
her
now
,
they
were
quite
alike
in
this
.
Both
knew
,
without
a
*NL*
shade
of
doubt
,
what
sort
of
thing
life
was
and
what
was
death
,
and
*NL*
though
neither
of
them
could
have
answered
,
and
would
even
not
have
*NL*
understood
the
questions
that
presented
themselves
to
Levin
,
both
had
no
*NL*
doubt
of
the
significance
of
this
event
,
and
were
precisely
alike
in
*NL*
their
way
of
looking
at
it
,
which
they
shared
with
millions
of
people
.
*NL*
The
proof
that
they
knew
for
a
certainty
the
nature
of
death
lay
in
the
*NL*
fact
that
they
knew
without
a
second
of
hesitation
how
to
deal
with
the
*NL*
dying
,
and
were
not
frightened
of
them
.
Levin
and
other
men
like
him
,
*NL*
though
they
could
have
said
a
great
deal
about
death
,
obviously
did
not
*NL*
know
this
since
they
were
afraid
of
death
,
and
were
absolutely
at
a
loss
*NL*
what
to
do
when
people
were
dying
.
If
Levin
had
been
alone
now
with
his
*NL*
brother
Nikolay
,
he
would
have
looked
at
him
with
terror
,
and
with
still
*NL*
greater
terror
waited
,
and
would
not
have
known
what
else
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
that
,
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
,
how
to
look
,
how
to
move
.
*NL*
To
talk
of
outside
things
seemed
to
him
shocking
,
impossible
,
to
talk
of
*NL*
death
and
depressing
subjects
--
also
impossible
.
To
be
silent
,
also
*NL*
impossible
.
``
If
I
look
at
him
he
will
think
I
am
studying
him
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
;
if
I
do
n't
look
at
him
,
he
'll
think
I
'm
thinking
of
other
*NL*
things
.
If
I
walk
on
tiptoe
,
he
will
be
vexed
;
to
tread
firmly
,
I
'm
*NL*
ashamed
.
''
Kitty
evidently
did
not
think
of
herself
,
and
had
no
time
to
*NL*
think
about
herself
:
she
was
thinking
about
him
because
she
knew
*NL*
something
,
and
all
went
well
.
She
told
him
about
herself
even
and
about
*NL*
her
wedding
,
and
smiled
and
sympathized
with
him
and
petted
him
,
and
*NL*
talked
of
cases
of
recovery
and
all
went
well
;
so
then
she
must
know
.
*NL*
The
proof
that
her
behavior
and
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
was
not
instinctive
,
*NL*
animal
,
irrational
,
was
that
apart
from
the
physical
treatment
,
the
*NL*
relief
of
suffering
,
both
Agafea
Mihalovna
and
Kitty
required
for
the
*NL*
dying
man
something
else
more
important
than
the
physical
treatment
,
and
*NL*
something
which
had
nothing
in
common
with
physical
conditions
.
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
speaking
of
the
man
just
dead
,
had
said
:
``
Well
,
thank
God
,
he
*NL*
took
the
sacrament
and
received
absolution
;
God
grant
each
one
of
us
*NL*
such
a
death
.
''
Katya
in
just
the
same
way
,
besides
all
her
care
about
*NL*
linen
,
bedsores
,
drink
,
found
time
the
very
first
day
to
persuade
the
*NL*
sick
man
of
the
necessity
of
taking
the
sacrament
and
receiving
*NL*
absolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
getting
back
from
the
sick-room
to
their
own
two
rooms
for
the
night
,
*NL*
Levin
sat
with
hanging
head
not
knowing
what
to
do
.
Not
to
speak
of
*NL*
supper
,
of
preparing
for
bed
,
of
considering
what
they
were
going
to
do
,
*NL*
he
could
not
even
talk
to
his
wife
;
he
was
ashamed
to
.
Kitty
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
was
more
active
than
usual
.
She
was
even
livelier
than
usual
.
*NL*
She
ordered
supper
to
be
brought
,
herself
unpacked
their
things
,
and
*NL*
herself
helped
to
make
the
beds
,
and
did
not
even
forget
to
sprinkle
*NL*
them
with
Persian
powder
.
She
showed
that
alertness
,
that
swiftness
of
*NL*
reflection
comes
out
in
men
before
a
battle
,
in
conflict
,
in
the
*NL*
dangerous
and
decisive
moments
of
life
--
those
moments
when
a
man
shows
*NL*
once
and
for
all
his
value
,
and
that
all
his
past
has
not
been
wasted
*NL*
but
has
been
a
preparation
for
these
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
went
rapidly
in
her
hands
,
and
before
it
was
twelve
o'clock
*NL*
all
their
things
were
arranged
cleanly
and
tidily
in
her
rooms
,
in
such
*NL*
a
way
that
the
hotel
rooms
seemed
like
home
:
the
beds
were
made
,
*NL*
brushes
,
combs
,
looking-glasses
were
put
out
,
table
napkins
were
spread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
that
it
was
unpardonable
to
eat
,
to
sleep
,
to
talk
even
now
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
movement
he
made
was
unseemly
.
She
*NL*
arranged
the
brushes
,
but
she
did
it
all
so
that
there
was
nothing
*NL*
shocking
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
could
neither
of
them
eat
,
however
,
and
for
a
long
while
they
could
*NL*
not
sleep
,
and
did
not
even
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
I
persuaded
him
to
receive
extreme
unction
tomorrow
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
sitting
in
her
dressing
jacket
before
her
folding
looking
*NL*
glass
,
combing
her
soft
,
fragrant
hair
with
a
fine
comb
.
``
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
it
,
but
I
know
,
mamma
has
told
me
,
there
are
prayers
said
for
*NL*
recovery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
he
can
possibly
recover
?
''
said
Levin
,
watching
a
slender
*NL*
tress
at
the
back
of
her
round
little
head
that
was
continually
hidden
*NL*
when
she
passed
the
comb
through
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
the
doctor
;
he
said
he
could
n't
live
more
than
three
days
.
But
*NL*
can
they
be
sure
?
I
'm
very
glad
,
anyway
,
that
I
persuaded
him
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
looking
askance
at
her
husband
through
her
hair
.
``
Anything
is
*NL*
possible
,
''
she
added
with
that
peculiar
,
rather
sly
expression
that
was
*NL*
always
in
her
face
when
she
spoke
of
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
their
conversation
about
religion
when
they
were
engaged
neither
*NL*
of
them
had
ever
started
a
discussion
of
the
subject
,
but
she
performed
*NL*
all
the
ceremonies
of
going
to
church
,
saying
her
prayers
,
and
so
on
,
*NL*
always
with
the
unvarying
conviction
that
this
ought
to
be
so
.
In
spite
*NL*
of
his
assertion
to
the
contrary
,
she
was
firmly
persuaded
that
he
was
*NL*
as
much
a
Christian
as
she
,
and
indeed
a
far
better
one
;
and
all
that
he
*NL*
said
about
it
was
simply
one
of
his
absurd
masculine
freaks
,
just
as
he
*NL*
would
say
about
her
_
broderie
anglaise
_
that
good
people
patch
holes
,
*NL*
but
that
she
cut
them
on
purpose
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
see
this
woman
,
Marya
Nikolaevna
,
did
not
know
how
to
manage
*NL*
all
this
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
And
...
I
must
own
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
you
came
.
*NL*
You
are
such
purity
that
...
''
He
took
her
hand
and
did
not
kiss
it
-LRB-
to
*NL*
kiss
her
hand
in
such
closeness
to
death
seemed
to
him
improper
-RRB-
;
he
*NL*
merely
squeezed
it
with
a
penitent
air
,
looking
at
her
brightening
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
been
miserable
for
you
to
be
alone
,
''
she
said
,
and
*NL*
lifting
her
hands
which
hid
her
cheeks
flushing
with
pleasure
,
twisted
*NL*
her
coil
of
hair
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
and
pinned
it
there
.
``
No
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
``
she
did
not
know
how
...
Luckily
,
I
learned
a
lot
at
Soden
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
there
are
not
people
there
so
ill
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
so
awful
to
me
is
that
I
ca
n't
see
him
as
he
was
when
he
was
*NL*
young
.
You
would
not
believe
how
charming
he
was
as
a
youth
,
but
I
did
*NL*
not
understand
him
then

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
quite
,
quite
believe
it
.
How
I
feel
that
we
might
have
been
*NL*
friends
!
''
she
said
;
and
,
distressed
at
what
she
had
said
,
she
looked
*NL*
round
at
her
husband
,
and
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
_
might
have
been
_
,
''
he
said
mournfully
.
``
He
's
just
one
of
those
*NL*
people
of
whom
they
say
they
're
not
for
this
world

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
many
days
before
us
;
we
must
go
to
bed

said
Kitty
,
*NL*
glancing
at
her
tiny
watch

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
sick
man
received
the
sacrament
and
extreme
unction
.
*NL*
During
the
ceremony
Nikolay
Levin
prayed
fervently
.
His
great
eyes
,
*NL*
fastened
on
the
holy
image
that
was
set
out
on
a
card
table
covered
with
*NL*
a
colored
napkin
,
expressed
such
passionate
prayer
and
hope
that
it
was
*NL*
awful
to
Levin
to
see
it
.
Levin
knew
that
this
passionate
prayer
and
*NL*
hope
would
only
make
him
feel
more
bitterly
parting
from
the
life
he
so
*NL*
loved
.
Levin
knew
his
brother
and
the
workings
of
his
intellect
:
he
knew
*NL*
that
his
unbelief
came
not
from
life
being
easier
for
him
without
faith
,
*NL*
but
had
grown
up
because
step
by
step
the
contemporary
scientific
*NL*
interpretation
of
natural
phenomena
crushed
out
the
possibility
of
*NL*
faith
;
and
so
he
knew
that
his
present
return
was
not
a
legitimate
one
,
*NL*
brought
about
by
way
of
the
same
working
of
his
intellect
,
but
simply
a
*NL*
temporary
,
interested
return
to
faith
in
a
desperate
hope
of
recovery
.
*NL*
Levin
knew
too
that
Kitty
had
strengthened
his
hope
by
accounts
of
the
*NL*
marvelous
recoveries
she
had
heard
of
.
Levin
knew
all
this
;
and
it
was
*NL*
agonizingly
painful
to
him
to
behold
the
supplicating
,
hopeful
eyes
and
*NL*
the
emaciated
wrist
,
lifted
with
difficulty
,
making
the
sign
of
the
*NL*
cross
on
the
tense
brow
,
and
the
prominent
shoulders
and
hollow
,
gasping
*NL*
chest
,
which
one
could
not
feel
consistent
with
the
life
the
sick
man
*NL*
was
praying
for
.
During
the
sacrament
Levin
did
what
he
,
an
unbeliever
,
*NL*
had
done
a
thousand
times
.
He
said
,
addressing
God
,
``
If
Thou
dost
exist
,
*NL*
make
this
man
to
recover
''
-LRB-
of
course
this
same
thing
has
been
repeated
*NL*
many
times

Thou

*NL*
*NL*
After
extreme
unction
the
sick
man
became
suddenly
much
better
.
He
did
*NL*
not
cough
once
in
the
course
of
an
hour
,
smiled
,
kissed
Kitty
's
hand
,
*NL*
thanking
her
with
tears
,
and
said
he
was
comfortable
,
free
from
pain
,
*NL*
and
that
he
felt
strong
and
had
an
appetite
.
He
even
raised
himself
when
*NL*
his
soup
was
brought
,
and
asked
for
a
cutlet
as
well
.
Hopelessly
ill
as
*NL*
he
was
,
obvious
as
it
was
at
the
first
glance
that
he
could
not
recover
,
*NL*
Levin
and
Kitty
were
for
that
hour
both
in
the
same
state
of
excitement
,
*NL*
happy
,
though
fearful
of
being
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
wonderful
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway
,
he
's
better
,
''
they
said
in
a
whisper
,
smiling
to
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
self-deception
was
not
of
long
duration
.
The
sick
man
fell
into
a
*NL*
quiet
sleep
,
but
he
was
waked
up
half
an
hour
later
by
his
cough
.
And
*NL*
all
at
once
every
hope
vanished
in
those
about
him
and
in
himself
.
The
*NL*
reality
of
his
suffering
crushed
all
hopes
in
Levin
and
Kitty
and
in
the
*NL*
sick
man
himself
,
leaving
no
doubt
,
no
memory
even
of
past
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
referring
to
what
he
had
believed
in
half
an
hour
before
,
as
*NL*
though
ashamed
even
to
recall
it
,
he
asked
for
iodine
to
inhale
in
a
*NL*
bottle
covered
with
perforated
paper
.
Levin
gave
him
the
bottle
,
and
the
*NL*
same
look
of
passionate
hope
with
which
he
had
taken
the
sacrament
was
*NL*
now
fastened
on
his
brother
,
demanding
from
him
the
confirmation
of
the
*NL*
doctor
's
words
that
inhaling
iodine
worked
wonders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Katya
not
here
?
''
he
gasped
,
looking
round
while
Levin
reluctantly
*NL*
assented
to
the
doctor
's
words
.
``
No
;
so
I
can
say
it
...
It
was
for
her
*NL*
sake
I
went
through
that
farce
.
She
's
so
sweet
;
but
you
and
I
ca
n't
*NL*
deceive
ourselves
.
This
is
what
I
believe
in
,
''
he
said
,
and
,
squeezing
*NL*
the
bottle
in
his
bony
hand
,
he
began
breathing
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
Levin
and
his
wife
were
drinking
tea
in
*NL*
their
room
when
Marya
Nikolaevna
ran
in
to
them
breathlessly
.
She
was
*NL*
pale
,
and
her
lips
were
quivering
.
``
He
is
dying
!
''
she
whispered
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
will
die
this
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
of
them
ran
to
him
.
He
was
sitting
raised
up
with
one
elbow
on
the
*NL*
bed
,
his
long
back
bent
,
and
his
head
hanging
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
Levin
asked
in
a
whisper
,
after
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
I
'm
setting
off
,
''
Nikolay
said
with
difficulty
,
but
with
extreme
*NL*
distinctness
,
screwing
the
words
out
of
himself
.
He
did
not
raise
his
*NL*
head
,
but
simply
turned
his
eyes
upwards
,
without
their
reaching
his
*NL*
brother
's
face
.
``
Katya
,
go
away
!
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
jumped
up
,
and
with
a
peremptory
whisper
made
her
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
setting
off
,
''
he
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
think
so
?
''
said
Levin
,
so
as
to
say
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
'm
setting
off
,
''
he
repeated
,
as
though
he
had
a
liking
for
*NL*
the
phrase
.
``
It
's
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Nikolaevna
went
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
lie
down
;
you
'd
be
easier
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
lie
down
soon
enough
,
''
he
pronounced
slowly
,
``
when
I
'm
dead
,
''
*NL*
he
said
sarcastically
,
wrathfully
.
``
Well
,
you
can
lay
me
down
if
you
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
laid
his
brother
on
his
back
,
sat
down
beside
him
,
and
gazed
at
*NL*
his
face
,
holding
his
breath
.
The
dying
man
lay
with
closed
eyes
,
but
*NL*
the
muscles
twitched
from
time
to
time
on
his
forehead
,
as
with
one
*NL*
thinking
deeply
and
intensely
.
Levin
involuntarily
thought
with
him
of
*NL*
what
it
was
that
was
happening
to
him
now
,
but
in
spite
of
all
his
*NL*
mental
efforts
to
go
along
with
him
he
saw
by
the
expression
of
that
*NL*
calm
,
stern
face
that
for
the
dying
man
all
was
growing
clearer
and
*NL*
clearer
that
was
still
as
dark
as
ever
for
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
so
,
''
the
dying
man
articulated
slowly
at
intervals
.
``
Wait
a
*NL*
little
.
''
He
was
silent
.
``
Right
!
''
he
pronounced
all
at
once
reassuringly
,
*NL*
as
though
all
were
solved
for
him
.
``
O
Lord
!
''
he
murmured
,
and
sighed
*NL*
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Nikolaevna
felt
his
feet
.
``
They
're
getting
cold
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
,
a
very
long
while
it
seemed
to
Levin
,
the
sick
man
lay
*NL*
motionless
.
But
he
was
still
alive
,
and
from
time
to
time
he
sighed
.
*NL*
Levin
by
now
was
exhausted
from
mental
strain
.
He
felt
that
,
with
no
*NL*
mental
effort
,
could
he
understand
what
it
was
that
was
_
right
_
.
He
*NL*
could
not
even
think
of
the
problem
of
death
itself
,
but
with
no
will
of
*NL*
his
own
thoughts
kept
coming
to
him
of
what
he
had
to
do
next
;
closing
*NL*
the
dead
man
's
eyes
,
dressing
him
,
ordering
the
coffin
.
And
,
strange
to
*NL*
say
,
he
felt
utterly
cold
,
and
was
not
conscious
of
sorrow
nor
of
loss
,
*NL*
less
still
of
pity
for
his
brother
.
If
he
had
any
feeling
for
his
*NL*
brother
at
that
moment
,
it
was
envy
for
the
knowledge
the
dying
man
had
*NL*
now
that
he
could
not
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
time
more
he
sat
over
him
so
,
continually
expecting
the
end
.
But
*NL*
the
end
did
not
come
.
The
door
opened
and
Kitty
appeared
.
Levin
got
up
*NL*
to
stop
her
.
But
at
the
moment
he
was
getting
up
,
he
caught
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
dying
man
stirring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
away
,
''
said
Nikolay
and
held
out
his
hand
.
Levin
gave
him
his
,
*NL*
and
angrily
waved
to
his
wife
to
go
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
dying
man
's
hand
in
his
hand
,
he
sat
for
half
an
hour
,
an
hour
,
*NL*
another
hour
.
He
did
not
think
of
death
at
all
now
.
He
wondered
what
*NL*
Kitty
was
doing
;
who
lived
in
the
next
room
;
whether
the
doctor
lived
in
*NL*
a
house
of
his
own
.
He
longed
for
food
and
for
sleep
.
He
cautiously
drew
*NL*
away
his
hand
and
felt
the
feet
.
The
feet
were
cold
,
but
the
sick
man
*NL*
was
still
breathing
.
Levin
tried
again
to
move
away
on
tiptoe
,
but
the
*NL*
sick
man
stirred
again
and
said
:
``
Do
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
dawn
came
;
the
sick
man
's
condition
was
unchanged
.
Levin
stealthily
*NL*
withdrew
his
hand
,
and
without
looking
at
the
dying
man
,
went
off
to
his
*NL*
own
room
and
went
to
sleep
.
When
he
woke
up
,
instead
of
news
of
his
*NL*
brother
's
death
which
he
expected
,
he
learned
that
the
sick
man
had
*NL*
returned
to
his
earlier
condition
.
He
had
begun
sitting
up
again
,
*NL*
coughing
,
had
begun
eating
again
,
talking
again
,
and
again
had
ceased
to
*NL*
talk
of
death
,
again
had
begun
to
express
hope
of
his
recovery
,
and
had
*NL*
become
more
irritable
and
more
gloomy
than
ever
.
No
one
,
neither
his
*NL*
brother
nor
Kitty
,
could
soothe
him
.
He
was
angry
with
everyone
,
and
*NL*
said
nasty
things
to
everyone
,
reproached
everyone
for
his
sufferings
,
*NL*
and
insisted
that
they
should
get
him
a
celebrated
doctor
from
Moscow
.
*NL*
To
all
inquiries
made
him
as
to
how
he
felt
,
he
made
the
same
answer
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
vindictive
reproachfulness
,
``
I
'm
suffering
*NL*
horribly
,
intolerably
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
was
suffering
more
and
more
,
especially
from
bedsores
,
*NL*
which
it
was
impossible
now
to
remedy
,
and
grew
more
and
more
angry
with
*NL*
everyone
about
him
,
blaming
them
for
everything
,
and
especially
for
not
*NL*
having
brought
him
a
doctor
from
Moscow
.
Kitty
tried
in
every
possible
*NL*
way
to
relieve
him
,
to
soothe
him
;
but
it
was
all
in
vain
,
and
Levin
saw
*NL*
that
she
herself
was
exhausted
both
physically
and
morally
,
though
she
*NL*
would
not
admit
it
.
The
sense
of
death
,
which
had
been
evoked
in
all
by
*NL*
his
taking
leave
of
life
on
the
night
when
he
had
sent
for
his
brother
,
*NL*
was
broken
up
.
Everyone
knew
that
he
must
inevitably
die
soon
,
that
he
*NL*
was
half
dead
already
.
Everyone
wished
for
nothing
but
that
he
should
*NL*
die
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
everyone
,
concealing
this
,
gave
him
*NL*
medicines
,
tried
to
find
remedies
and
doctors
,
and
deceived
him
and
*NL*
themselves
and
each
other
.
All
this
was
falsehood
,
disgusting
,
*NL*
irreverent
deceit
.
And
owing
to
the
bent
of
his
character
,
and
because
*NL*
he
loved
the
dying
man
more
than
anyone
else
did
,
Levin
was
most
*NL*
painfully
conscious
of
this
deceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
who
had
long
been
possessed
by
the
idea
of
reconciling
his
*NL*
brothers
,
at
least
in
face
of
death
,
had
written
to
his
brother
,
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
and
having
received
an
answer
from
him
,
he
read
this
letter
*NL*
to
the
sick
man
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
wrote
that
he
could
not
come
himself
,
*NL*
and
in
touching
terms
he
begged
his
brother
's
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
write
to
him
?
''
said
Levin
.
``
I
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
*NL*
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
the
least
!
''
Nikolay
answered
,
vexed
at
the
question
.
``
Tell
him
*NL*
to
send
me
a
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
more
days
of
agony
followed
;
the
sick
man
was
still
in
the
same
*NL*
condition
.
The
sense
of
longing
for
his
death
was
felt
by
everyone
now
*NL*
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
,
by
the
waiters
and
the
hotel-keeper
and
all
*NL*
the
people
staying
in
the
hotel
,
and
the
doctor
and
Marya
Nikolaevna
and
*NL*
Levin
and
Kitty
.
The
sick
man
alone
did
not
express
this
feeling
,
but
on
*NL*
the
contrary
was
furious
at
their
not
getting
him
doctors
,
and
went
on
*NL*
taking
medicine
and
talking
of
life
.
Only
at
rare
moments
,
when
the
*NL*
opium
gave
him
an
instant
's
relief
from
the
never-ceasing
pain
,
he
would
*NL*
sometimes
,
half
asleep
,
utter
what
was
ever
more
intense
in
his
heart
*NL*
than
in
all
the
others
:
``
Oh
,
if
it
were
only
the
end
!
''
or
:
``
When
will
it
*NL*
be
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sufferings
,
steadily
growing
more
intense
,
did
their
work
and
*NL*
prepared
him
for
death
.
There
was
no
position
in
which
he
was
not
in
*NL*
pain
,
there
was
not
a
minute
in
which
he
was
unconscious
of
it
,
not
a
*NL*
limb
,
not
a
part
of
his
body
that
did
not
ache
and
cause
him
agony
.
Even
*NL*
the
memories
,
the
impressions
,
the
thoughts
of
this
body
awakened
in
him
*NL*
now
the
same
aversion
as
the
body
itself
.
The
sight
of
other
people
,
*NL*
their
remarks
,
his
own
reminiscences
,
everything
was
for
him
a
source
of
*NL*
agony
.
Those
about
him
felt
this
,
and
instinctively
did
not
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
move
freely
,
to
talk
,
to
express
their
wishes
before
him
.
*NL*
All
his
life
was
merged
in
the
one
feeling
of
suffering
and
desire
to
be
*NL*
rid
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
evidently
coming
over
him
that
revulsion
that
would
make
him
*NL*
look
upon
death
as
the
goal
of
his
desires
,
as
happiness
.
Hitherto
each
*NL*
individual
desire
,
aroused
by
suffering
or
privation
,
such
as
hunger
,
*NL*
fatigue
,
thirst
,
had
been
satisfied
by
some
bodily
function
giving
*NL*
pleasure
.
But
now
no
physical
craving
or
suffering
received
relief
,
and
*NL*
the
effort
to
relieve
them
only
caused
fresh
suffering
.
And
so
all
*NL*
desires
were
merged
in
one
--
the
desire
to
be
rid
of
all
his
sufferings
*NL*
and
their
source
,
the
body
.
But
he
had
no
words
to
express
this
desire
*NL*
of
deliverance
,
and
so
he
did
not
speak
of
it
,
and
from
habit
asked
for
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
desires
which
could
not
now
be
satisfied
.
``
Turn
me
*NL*
over
on
the
other
side
,
''
he
would
say
,
and
immediately
after
he
would
*NL*
ask
to
be
turned
back
again
as
before
.
``
Give
me
some
broth
.
Take
away
*NL*
the
broth
.
Talk
of
something
:
why
are
you
silent
?
''
And
directly
they
*NL*
began
to
talk
he
would
close
his
eyes
,
and
would
show
weariness
,
*NL*
indifference
,
and
loathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
tenth
day
from
their
arrival
at
the
town
,
Kitty
was
unwell
.
She
*NL*
suffered
from
headache
and
sickness
,
and
she
could
not
get
up
all
the
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
opined
that
the
indisposition
arose
from
fatigue
and
*NL*
excitement
,
and
prescribed
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
however
,
Kitty
got
up
and
went
as
usual
with
her
work
to
*NL*
the
sick
man
.
He
looked
at
her
sternly
when
she
came
in
,
and
smiled
*NL*
contemptuously
when
she
said
she
had
been
unwell
.
That
day
he
was
*NL*
continually
blowing
his
nose
,
and
groaning
piteously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worse
,
''
he
articulated
with
difficulty
.
``
In
pain
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
pain
,
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
over
today
,
you
will
see
,
''
said
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
Though
it
*NL*
was
said
in
a
whisper
,
the
sick
man
,
whose
hearing
Levin
had
noticed
was
*NL*
very
keen
,
must
have
heard
.
Levin
said
hush
to
her
,
and
looked
round
at
*NL*
the
sick
man
.
Nikolay
had
heard
;
but
these
words
produced
no
effect
on
*NL*
him
.
His
eyes
had
still
the
same
intense
,
reproachful
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
think
so
?
''
Levin
asked
her
,
when
she
had
followed
him
into
*NL*
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
begun
picking
at
himself
,
''
said
Marya
Nikolaevna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
this
,
''
she
said
,
tugging
at
the
folds
of
her
woolen
skirt
.
Levin
*NL*
noticed
,
indeed
,
that
all
that
day
the
patient
pulled
at
himself
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
trying
to
snatch
something
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marya
Nikolaevna
's
prediction
came
true
.
Towards
night
the
sick
man
was
*NL*
not
able
to
lift
his
hands
,
and
could
only
gaze
before
him
with
the
same
*NL*
intensely
concentrated
expression
in
his
eyes
.
Even
when
his
brother
or
*NL*
Kitty
bent
over
him
,
so
that
he
could
see
them
,
he
looked
just
the
same
.
*NL*
Kitty
sent
for
the
priest
to
read
the
prayer
for
the
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
priest
was
reading
it
,
the
dying
man
did
not
show
any
sign
of
*NL*
life
;
his
eyes
were
closed
.
Levin
,
Kitty
,
and
Marya
Nikolaevna
stood
at
*NL*
the
bedside
.
The
priest
had
not
quite
finished
reading
the
prayer
when
*NL*
the
dying
man
stretched
,
sighed
,
and
opened
his
eyes
.
The
priest
,
on
*NL*
finishing
the
prayer
,
put
the
cross
to
the
cold
forehead
,
then
slowly
*NL*
returned
it
to
the
stand
,
and
after
standing
for
two
minutes
more
in
*NL*
silence
,
he
touched
the
huge
,
bloodless
hand
that
was
turning
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
gone
,
''
said
the
priest
,
and
would
have
moved
away
;
but
suddenly
*NL*
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
mustaches
of
the
dead
man
that
seemed
*NL*
glued
together
,
and
quite
distinctly
in
the
hush
they
heard
from
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
chest
the
sharply
defined
sounds
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
...
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
minute
later
the
face
brightened
,
a
smile
came
out
under
the
*NL*
mustaches
,
and
the
women
who
had
gathered
round
began
carefully
laying
*NL*
out
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
his
brother
,
and
the
nearness
of
death
,
revived
in
Levin
*NL*
that
sense
of
horror
in
face
of
the
insoluble
enigma
,
together
with
the
*NL*
nearness
and
inevitability
of
death
,
that
had
come
upon
him
that
autumn
*NL*
evening
when
his
brother
had
come
to
him
.
This
feeling
was
now
even
*NL*
stronger
than
before
;
even
less
than
before
did
he
feel
capable
of
*NL*
apprehending
the
meaning
of
death
,
and
its
inevitability
rose
up
before
*NL*
him
more
terrible
than
ever
.
But
now
,
thanks
to
his
wife
's
presence
,
*NL*
that
feeling
did
not
reduce
him
to
despair
.
In
spite
of
death
,
he
felt
*NL*
the
need
of
life
and
love
.
He
felt
that
love
saved
him
from
despair
,
and
*NL*
that
this
love
,
under
the
menace
of
despair
,
had
become
still
stronger
*NL*
and
purer
.
The
one
mystery
of
death
,
still
unsolved
,
had
scarcely
passed
*NL*
before
his
eyes
,
when
another
mystery
had
arisen
,
as
insoluble
,
urging
*NL*
him
to
love
and
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
confirmed
his
suppositions
in
regard
to
Kitty
.
Her
*NL*
indisposition
was
a
symptom
that
she
was
with
child
.

Chapter
21
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
when
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
understood
from
his
*NL*
interviews
with
Betsy
and
with
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
that
all
that
was
*NL*
expected
of
him
was
to
leave
his
wife
in
peace
,
without
burdening
her
*NL*
with
his
presence
,
and
that
his
wife
herself
desired
this
,
he
felt
so
*NL*
distraught
that
he
could
come
to
no
decision
of
himself
;
he
did
not
know
*NL*
himself
what
he
wanted
now
,
and
putting
himself
in
the
hands
of
those
*NL*
who
were
so
pleased
to
interest
themselves
in
his
affairs
,
he
met
*NL*
everything
with
unqualified
assent
.
It
was
only
when
Anna
had
left
his
*NL*
house
,
and
the
English
governess
sent
to
ask
him
whether
she
should
dine
*NL*
with
him
or
separately
,
that
for
the
first
time
he
clearly
comprehended
*NL*
his
position
,
and
was
appalled
by
it
.
Most
difficult
of
all
in
this
*NL*
position
was
the
fact
that
he
could
not
in
any
way
connect
and
reconcile
*NL*
his
past
with
what
was
now
.
It
was
not
the
past
when
he
had
lived
*NL*
happily
with
his
wife
that
troubled
him
.
The
transition
from
that
past
*NL*
to
a
knowledge
of
his
wife
's
unfaithfulness
he
had
lived
through
*NL*
miserably
already
;
that
state
was
painful
,
but
he
could
understand
it
.
*NL*
If
his
wife
had
then
,
on
declaring
to
him
her
unfaithfulness
,
left
him
,
*NL*
he
would
have
been
wounded
,
unhappy
,
but
he
would
not
have
been
in
the
*NL*
hopeless
position
--
incomprehensible
to
himself
--
in
which
he
felt
himself
*NL*
now
.
He
could
not
now
reconcile
his
immediate
past
,
his
tenderness
,
his
*NL*
love
for
his
sick
wife
,
and
for
the
other
man
's
child
with
what
was
now
*NL*
the
case
,
that
is
with
the
fact
that
,
as
it
were
,
in
return
for
all
this
*NL*
he
now
found
himself
alone
,
put
to
shame
,
a
laughing-stock
,
needed
by
no
*NL*
one
,
and
despised
by
everyone
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
two
days
after
his
wife
's
departure
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
received
applicants
for
assistance
and
his
chief
secretary
,
drove
to
the
*NL*
committee
,
and
went
down
to
dinner
in
the
dining
room
as
usual
.
Without
*NL*
giving
himself
a
reason
for
what
he
was
doing
,
he
strained
every
nerve
*NL*
of
his
being
for
those
two
days
,
simply
to
preserve
an
appearance
of
*NL*
composure
,
and
even
of
indifference
.
Answering
inquiries
about
the
*NL*
disposition
of
Anna
Arkadyevna
's
rooms
and
belongings
,
he
had
exercised
*NL*
immense
self-control
to
appear
like
a
man
in
whose
eyes
what
had
*NL*
occurred
was
not
unforeseen
nor
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
events
,
*NL*
and
he
attained
his
aim
:
no
one
could
have
detected
in
him
signs
of
*NL*
despair
.
But
on
the
second
day
after
her
departure
,
when
Korney
gave
him
*NL*
a
bill
from
a
fashionable
draper
's
shop
,
which
Anna
had
forgotten
to
*NL*
pay
,
and
announced
that
the
clerk
from
the
shop
was
waiting
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
told
him
to
show
the
clerk
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
your
excellency
,
for
venturing
to
trouble
you
.
But
if
you
*NL*
direct
us
to
apply
to
her
excellency
,
would
you
graciously
oblige
us
*NL*
with
her
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
pondered
,
as
it
seemed
to
the
clerk
,
and
all
at
*NL*
once
,
turning
round
,
he
sat
down
at
the
table
.
Letting
his
head
sink
*NL*
into
his
hands
,
he
sat
for
a
long
while
in
that
position
,
several
times
*NL*
attempted
to
speak
and
stopped
short
.
Korney
,
perceiving
his
master
's
*NL*
emotion
,
asked
the
clerk
to
call
another
time
.
Left
alone
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
recognized
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
keep
up
the
*NL*
line
of
firmness
and
composure
any
longer
.
He
gave
orders
for
the
*NL*
carriage
that
was
awaiting
him
to
be
taken
back
,
and
for
no
one
to
be
*NL*
admitted
,
and
he
did
not
go
down
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
could
not
endure
the
weight
of
universal
contempt
and
*NL*
exasperation
,
which
he
had
distinctly
seen
in
the
face
of
the
clerk
and
*NL*
of
Korney
,
and
of
everyone
,
without
exception
,
whom
he
had
met
during
*NL*
those
two
days
.
He
felt
that
he
could
not
turn
aside
from
himself
the
*NL*
hatred
of
men
,
because
that
hatred
did
not
come
from
his
being
bad
-LRB-
in
*NL*
that
case
he
could
have
tried
to
be
better
-RRB-
,
but
from
his
being
*NL*
shamefully
and
repulsively
unhappy
.
He
knew
that
for
this
,
for
the
very
*NL*
fact
that
his
heart
was
torn
with
grief
,
they
would
be
merciless
to
him
.
*NL*
He
felt
that
men
would
crush
him
as
dogs
strangle
a
torn
dog
yelping
*NL*
with
pain
.
He
knew
that
his
sole
means
of
security
against
people
was
to
*NL*
hide
his
wounds
from
them
,
and
instinctively
he
tried
to
do
this
for
two
*NL*
days
,
but
now
he
felt
incapable
of
keeping
up
the
unequal
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
despair
was
even
intensified
by
the
consciousness
that
he
was
*NL*
utterly
alone
in
his
sorrow
.
In
all
Petersburg
there
was
not
a
human
*NL*
being
to
whom
he
could
express
what
he
was
feeling
,
who
would
feel
for
*NL*
him
,
not
as
a
high
official
,
not
as
a
member
of
society
,
but
simply
as
a
*NL*
suffering
man
;
indeed
he
had
not
such
a
one
in
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
grew
up
an
orphan
.
There
were
two
brothers
.
They
*NL*
did
not
remember
their
father
,
and
their
mother
died
when
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
ten
years
old
.
The
property
was
a
small
one
.
Their
*NL*
uncle
,
Karenin
,
a
government
official
of
high
standing
,
at
one
time
a
*NL*
favorite
of
the
late
Tsar
,
had
brought
them
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
completing
his
high
school
and
university
courses
with
medals
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
,
with
his
uncle
's
aid
,
immediately
started
in
a
*NL*
prominent
position
in
the
service
,
and
from
that
time
forward
he
had
*NL*
devoted
himself
exclusively
to
political
ambition
.
In
the
high
school
*NL*
and
the
university
,
and
afterwards
in
the
service
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
had
never
formed
a
close
friendship
with
anyone
.
His
brother
had
been
*NL*
the
person
nearest
to
his
heart
,
but
he
had
a
post
in
the
Ministry
of
*NL*
Foreign
Affairs
,
and
was
always
abroad
,
where
he
had
died
shortly
after
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
governor
of
a
province
,
Anna
's
aunt
,
a
wealthy
provincial
*NL*
lady
,
had
thrown
him
--
middle-aged
as
he
was
,
though
young
for
a
*NL*
governor
--
with
her
niece
,
and
had
succeeded
in
putting
him
in
such
a
*NL*
position
that
he
had
either
to
declare
himself
or
to
leave
the
town
.
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
not
long
in
hesitation
.
There
were
at
the
time
*NL*
as
many
reasons
for
the
step
as
against
it
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
overbalancing
consideration
to
outweigh
his
invariable
rule
of
*NL*
abstaining
when
in
doubt
.
But
Anna
's
aunt
had
through
a
common
*NL*
acquaintance
insinuated
that
he
had
already
compromised
the
girl
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
in
honor
bound
to
make
her
an
offer
.
He
made
the
offer
,
and
*NL*
concentrated
on
his
betrothed
and
his
wife
all
the
feeling
of
which
he
*NL*
was
capable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attachment
he
felt
to
Anna
precluded
in
his
heart
every
need
of
*NL*
intimate
relations
with
others
.
And
now
among
all
his
acquaintances
he
*NL*
had
not
one
friend
.
He
had
plenty
of
so-called
connections
,
but
no
*NL*
friendships
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
plenty
of
people
whom
he
could
*NL*
invite
to
dinner
,
to
whose
sympathy
he
could
appeal
in
any
public
affair
*NL*
he
was
concerned
about
,
whose
interest
he
could
reckon
upon
for
anyone
*NL*
he
wished
to
help
,
with
whom
he
could
candidly
discuss
other
people
's
*NL*
business
and
affairs
of
state
.
But
his
relations
with
these
people
were
*NL*
confined
to
one
clearly
defined
channel
,
and
had
a
certain
routine
from
*NL*
which
it
was
impossible
to
depart
.
There
was
one
man
,
a
comrade
of
his
*NL*
at
the
university
,
with
whom
he
had
made
friends
later
,
and
with
whom
he
*NL*
could
have
spoken
of
a
personal
sorrow
;
but
this
friend
had
a
post
in
*NL*
the
Department
of
Education
in
a
remote
part
of
Russia
.
Of
the
people
in
*NL*
Petersburg
the
most
intimate
and
most
possible
were
his
chief
secretary
*NL*
and
his
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mihail
Vassilievitch
Sludin
,
the
chief
secretary
,
was
a
straightforward
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
good-hearted
,
and
conscientious
man
,
and
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
aware
of
his
personal
goodwill
.
But
their
five
years
*NL*
of
official
work
together
seemed
to
have
put
a
barrier
between
them
that
*NL*
cut
off
warmer
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
signing
the
papers
brought
him
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
sat
for
*NL*
a
long
while
in
silence
,
glancing
at
Mihail
Vassilievitch
,
and
several
*NL*
times
he
attempted
to
speak
,
but
could
not
.
He
had
already
prepared
the
*NL*
phrase
:
``
You
have
heard
of
my
trouble
?
''
But
he
ended
by
saying
,
as
*NL*
usual
:
``
So
you
'll
get
this
ready
for
me
?
''
and
with
that
dismissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
person
was
the
doctor
,
who
had
also
a
kindly
feeling
for
him
;
*NL*
but
there
had
long
existed
a
taciturn
understanding
between
them
that
*NL*
both
were
weighed
down
by
work
,
and

*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
forgotten
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
but
she
*NL*
had
not
forgotten
him
.
At
the
bitterest
moment
of
his
lonely
despair
she
*NL*
came
to
him
,
and
without
waiting
to
be
announced
,
walked
straight
into
*NL*
his
study
.
She
found
him
as
he
was
sitting
with
his
head
in
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
J'ai
force

,
''
she
said
,
walking
in
with
rapid
steps
and
*NL*
breathing
hard
with
excitement
and
rapid
exercise
.
``
I
have
heard
all
!
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
Dear
friend
!
''
she
went
on
,
warmly
squeezing
his
*NL*
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
gazing
with
her
fine
pensive
eyes
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
frowning
,
got
up
,
and
disengaging
his
hand
,
moved
*NL*
her
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
,
countess
?
I
'm
seeing
no
one
because
I
'm
unwell
,
*NL*
countess
,
''
he
said
,
and
his
lips
twitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friend
!
''
repeated
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
never
taking
her
eyes
*NL*
off
his
,
and
suddenly
her
eyebrows
rose
at
the
inner
corners
,
describing
*NL*
a
triangle
on
her
forehead
,
her
ugly
yellow
face
became
still
uglier
,
*NL*
but
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
felt
that
she
was
sorry
for
him
and
was
*NL*
preparing
to
cry
.
And
he
too
was
softened
;
he
snatched
her
plump
hand
*NL*
and
proceeded
to
kiss
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friend
!
''
she
said
in
a
voice
breaking
with
emotion
.
``
You
ought
not
*NL*
to
give
way
to
grief
.
Your
sorrow
is
a
great
one
,
but
you
ought
to
find
*NL*
consolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
crushed
,
I
am
annihilated
,
I
am
no
longer
a
man
!
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
letting
go
her
hand
,
but
still
gazing
into
her
brimming
*NL*
eyes
.
``
My
position
is
so
awful
because
I
can
find
nowhere
,
I
can
not
find
*NL*
within
me
strength
to
support
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
find
support
;
seek
it
--
not
in
me
,
though
I
beseech
you
to
*NL*
believe
in
my
friendship
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
sigh
.
``
Our
support
is
love
,
*NL*
that
love
that
He
has
vouchsafed
us
.
His
burden
is
light
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
with
the
look
of
ecstasy
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
knew
so
well
.
``
He
will
be
*NL*
your
support
and
your
succor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
there
was
in
these
words
a
flavor
of
that
sentimental
emotion
*NL*
at
her
own
lofty
feelings
,
and
that
new
mystical
fervor
which
had
lately
*NL*
gained
ground
in
Petersburg
,
and
which
seemed
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
disproportionate
,
still
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
hear
this
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
weak
.
I
am
crushed
.
I
foresaw
nothing
,
and
now
I
understand
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friend
,
''
repeated
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
loss
of
what
I
have
not
now
,
it
's
not
that
!
''
pursued
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
I
do
not
grieve
for
that
.
But
I
can
not
help
*NL*
feeling
humiliated
before
other
people
for
the
position
I
am
placed
in
.
*NL*
It
is
wrong
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
I
ca
n't
help
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
you
it
was
performed
that
noble
act
of
forgiveness
,
at
which
I
was
*NL*
moved
to
ecstasy

and
everyone
else
too
,
but
He
,
working
within
your
*NL*
heart

said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
raising
her
eyes
rapturously
,
``
and
*NL*
so
you
can
not
be
ashamed
of
your
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
knitted
his
brows
,
and
crooking
his
hands
,
he
*NL*
cracked
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
know
all
the
facts
,
''
he
said
in
his
thin
voice
.
``
A
man
's
*NL*
strength
has
its
limits
,
countess
,
and
I
have
reached
my
limits
.
The
*NL*
whole
day
I
have
had
to
be
making
arrangements
,
arrangements
about
*NL*
household
matters
arising
''
-LRB-
he
emphasized
the
word
_
arising
_
-RRB-
``
from
my
*NL*
new
,
solitary
position
.
The
servants
,
the
governess
,
the
accounts
...
*NL*
These
pinpricks
have
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
,
and
I
have
not
the
*NL*
strength
to
bear
it
.
At
dinner
...
yesterday
,
I
was
almost
getting
up
*NL*
from
the
dinner
table
.
I
could
not
bear
the
way
my
son
looked
at
me
.
He
*NL*
did
not
ask
me
the
meaning
of
it
all
,
but
he
wanted
to
ask
,
and
I
could
*NL*
not
bear
the
look
in
his
eyes
.
He
was
afraid
to
look
at
me
,
but
that
is
*NL*
not
all
...
''
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
would
have
referred
to
the
bill
that
*NL*
had
been
brought
him
,
but
his
voice
shook
,
and
he
stopped
.
That
bill
on
*NL*
blue
paper
,
for
a
hat
and
ribbons
,
he
could
not
recall
without
a
rush
of
*NL*
self-pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
dear
friend
,
''
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
``
I
understand
it
all
.
*NL*
Succor
and
comfort
you
will
find
not
in
me
,
though
I
have
come
only
to
*NL*
aid
you
if
I
can
.
If
I
could
take
from
off
you
all
these
petty
,
*NL*
humiliating
cares
...
I
understand
that
a
woman
's
word
,
a
woman
's
*NL*
superintendence
is
needed
.
You
will
intrust
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silently
and
gratefully
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
pressed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Together
we
will
take
care
of
Seryozha

Practical
affairs
are
not
my

But
I

set

I

be
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
help
thanking
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
dear
friend
,
do
not
give
way
to
the
feeling
of
which
you
*NL*
spoke
--
being
ashamed
of
what
is
the
Christian
's
highest
glory
:
_
he
who
*NL*
humbles
himself
shall
be
exalted
_
.
And
you
can
not
thank
me
.
You
must
*NL*
thank
Him
,
and
pray
to
Him
for
succor
.
In
Him
alone
we
find
peace
,
*NL*
consolation
,
salvation
,
and
love
,
''
she
said
,
and
turning
her
eyes
*NL*
heavenwards
,
she
began
praying
,
as
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
gathered
from
*NL*
her
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
listened
to
her
now
,
and
those
expressions
which
*NL*
had
seemed
to
him
,
if
not
distasteful
,
at
least
exaggerated
,
now
seemed
*NL*
to
him
natural
and
consolatory
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
disliked
this
*NL*
new
enthusiastic
fervor
.
He
was
a
believer
,
who
was
interested
in
*NL*
religion
primarily
in
its
political
aspect
,
and
the
new
doctrine
which
*NL*
ventured
upon
several
new
interpretations
,
just
because
it
paved
the
way
*NL*
to
discussion
and
analysis
,
was
in
principle
disagreeable
to
him
.
He
had
*NL*
hitherto
taken
up
a
cold
and
even
antagonistic
attitude
to
this
new
*NL*
doctrine
,
and
with
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
who
had
been
carried
away
by
*NL*
it
,
he
had
never
argued
,
but
by
silence
had
assiduously
parried
her
*NL*
attempts
to
provoke
him
into
argument
.
Now
for
the
first
time
he
heard
*NL*
her
words
with
pleasure
,
and
did
not
inwardly
oppose
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
,
very
grateful
to
you
,
both
for
your
deeds
and
for
your
*NL*
words
,
''
he
said
,
when
she
had
finished
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
once
more
pressed
both
her
friend
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
will
enter
upon
my
duties
,
''
she
said
with
a
smile
after
a
pause
,
*NL*
as
she
wiped
away
the
traces
of
tears
.
``
I
am
going
to
Seryozha
.
Only
in
*NL*
the
last
extremity
shall
I
apply
to
you
.
''
And
she
got
up
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
went
into
Seryozha
's
part
of
the
house
,
and
*NL*
dropping
tears
on
the
scared
child
's
cheeks
,
she
told
him
that
his
*NL*
father
was
a
saint
and
his
mother
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
kept
her
promise
.
She
did
actually
take
upon
*NL*
herself
the
care
of
the
organization
and
management
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
household
.
But
she
had
not
overstated
the
case
when
*NL*
saying
that
practical
affairs
were
not
her
strong
point
.
All
her
*NL*
arrangements
had
to
be
modified
because
they
could
not
be
carried
out
,
*NL*
and
they
were
modified
by
Korney
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
valet
,
who
,
*NL*
though
no
one
was
aware
of
the
fact
,
now
managed
Karenin
's
household
,
*NL*
and
quietly
and
discreetly
reported
to
his
master
while
he
was
dressing
*NL*
all
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
.
But
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
help
was
none
*NL*
the
less
real
;
she
gave
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
moral
support
in
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
her
love
and
respect
for
him
,
and
still
more
,
as
it
was
*NL*
soothing
to
her
to
believe
,
in
that
she
almost
turned
him
to
*NL*
Christianity
--
that
is
,
from
an
indifferent
and
apathetic
believer
she
*NL*
turned
him
into
an
ardent
and
steadfast
adherent
of
the
new
*NL*
interpretation
of
Christian
doctrine
,
which
had
been
gaining
ground
of
*NL*
late
in
Petersburg
.
It
was
easy
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
to
believe
in
*NL*
this
teaching
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
like
Lidia
Ivanovna
indeed
,
and
*NL*
others
who
shared
their
views
,
was
completely
devoid
of
vividness
of
*NL*
imagination
,
that
spiritual
faculty
in
virtue
of
which
the
conceptions
*NL*
evoked
by
the
imagination
become
so
vivid
that
they
must
needs
be
in
*NL*
harmony
with
other
conceptions
,
and
with
actual
fact
.
He
saw
nothing
*NL*
impossible
and
inconceivable
in
the
idea
that
death
,
though
existing
for
*NL*
unbelievers
,
did
not
exist
for
him
,
and
that
,
as
he
was
possessed
of
the
*NL*
most
perfect
faith
,
of
the
measure
of
which
he
was
himself
the
judge
,
*NL*
therefore
there
was
no
sin
in
his
soul
,
and
he
was
experiencing
complete
*NL*
salvation
here
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
the
erroneousness
and
shallowness
of
this
conception
of
*NL*
his
faith
was
dimly
perceptible
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
he
knew
*NL*
that
when
,
without
the
slightest
idea
that
his
forgiveness
was
the
*NL*
action
of
a
higher
power
,
he
had
surrendered
directly
to
the
feeling
of
*NL*
forgiveness
,
he
had
felt
more
happiness
than
now
when
he
was
thinking
*NL*
every
instant
that
Christ
was
in
his
heart
,
and
that
in
signing
official
*NL*
papers
he
was
doing
His
will
.
But
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
it
was
a
*NL*
necessity
to
think
in
that
way
;
it
was
such
a
necessity
for
him
in
his
*NL*
humiliation
to
have
some
elevated
standpoint
,
however
imaginary
,
from
*NL*
which
,
looked
down
upon
by
all
,
he
could
look
down
on
others
,
that
he
*NL*
clung
,
as
to
his
one
salvation
,
to
his
delusion
of
salvation
.

Chapter
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
,
as
a
very
young
and
sentimental
girl
,
*NL*
been
married
to
a
wealthy
man
of
high
rank
,
an
extremely
good-natured
,
*NL*
jovial
,
and
extremely
dissipated
rake
.
Two
months
after
marriage
her
*NL*
husband
abandoned
her
,
and
her
impassioned
protestations
of
affection
he
*NL*
met
with
a
sarcasm
and
even
hostility
that
people
knowing
the
count
's
*NL*
good
heart
,
and
seeing
no
defects
in
the
sentimental
Lidia
,
were
at
a
*NL*
loss
to
explain
.
Though
they
were
divorced
and
lived
apart
,
yet
whenever
*NL*
the
husband
met
the
wife
,
he
invariably
behaved
to
her
with
the
same
*NL*
malignant
irony
,
the
cause
of
which
was
incomprehensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
long
given
up
being
in
love
with
her
*NL*
husband
,
but
from
that
time
she
had
never
given
up
being
in
love
with
*NL*
someone
.
She
was
in
love
with
several
people
at
once
,
both
men
and
*NL*
women
;
she
had
been
in
love
with
almost
everyone
who
had
been
*NL*
particularly
distinguished
in
any
way
.
She
was
in
love
with
all
the
new
*NL*
princes
and
princesses
who
married
into
the
imperial
family
;
she
had
*NL*
been
in
love
with
a
high
dignitary
of
the
Church
,
a
vicar
,
and
a
parish
*NL*
priest
;
she
had
been
in
love
with
a
journalist
,
three
Slavophiles
,
with
*NL*
Komissarov
,
with
a
minister
,
a
doctor
,
an
English
missionary
and
*NL*
Karenin
.
All
these
passions
constantly
waning
or
growing
more
ardent
,
*NL*
did
not
prevent
her
from
keeping
up
the
most
extended
and
complicated
*NL*
relations
with
the
court
and
fashionable
society
.
But
from
the
time
that
*NL*
after
Karenin
's
trouble
she
took
him
under
her
special
protection
,
from
*NL*
the
time
that
she
set
to
work
in
Karenin
's
household
looking
after
his
*NL*
welfare
,
she
felt
that
all
her
other
attachments
were
not
the
real
*NL*
thing
,
and
that
she
was
now
genuinely
in
love
,
and
with
no
one
but
*NL*
Karenin
.
The
feeling
she
now
experienced
for
him
seemed
to
her
stronger
*NL*
than
any
of
her
former
feelings
.
Analyzing
her
feeling
,
and
comparing
it
*NL*
with
former
passions
,
she
distinctly
perceived
that
she
would
not
have
*NL*
been
in
love
with
Komissarov
if
he
had
not
saved
the
life
of
the
Tsar
,
*NL*
that
she
would
not
have
been
in
love
with
Ristitch-Kudzhitsky
if
there
*NL*
had
been
no
Slavonic
question
,
but
that
she
loved
Karenin
for
himself
,
*NL*
for
his
lofty
,
uncomprehended
soul
,
for
the
sweet
--
to
her
--
high
notes
of
*NL*
his
voice
,
for
his
drawling
intonation
,
his
weary
eyes
,
his
character
,
*NL*
and
his
soft
white
hands
with
their
swollen
veins
.
She
was
not
simply
*NL*
overjoyed
at
meeting
him
,
but
she
sought
in
his
face
signs
of
the
*NL*
impression
she
was
making
on
him
.
She
tried
to
please
him
,
not
by
her
*NL*
words
only
,
but
in
her
whole
person
.
For
his
sake
it
was
that
she
now
*NL*
lavished
more
care
on
her
dress
than
before
.
She
caught
herself
in
*NL*
reveries
on
what
might
have
been
,
if
she
had
not
been
married
and
he
had
*NL*
been
free
.
She
blushed
with
emotion
when
he
came
into
the
room
,
she
*NL*
could
not
repress
a
smile
of
rapture
when
he
said
anything
amiable
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
days
now
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
been
in
a
state
of
*NL*
intense
excitement
.
She
had
learned
that
Anna
and
Vronsky
were
in
*NL*
Petersburg
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
must
be
saved
from
seeing
her
,
he
must
*NL*
be
saved
even
from
the
torturing
knowledge
that
that
awful
woman
was
in
*NL*
the
same
town
with
him
,
and
that
he
might
meet
her
any
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
made
inquiries
through
her
friends
as
to
what
those
*NL*
_
infamous
people
_
,
as
she
called
Anna
and
Vronsky
,
intended
doing
,
and
*NL*
she
endeavored
so
to
guide
every
movement
of
her
friend
during
those
*NL*
days
that
he
could
not
come
across
them
.
The
young
adjutant
,
an
*NL*
acquaintance
of
Vronsky
,
through
whom
she
obtained
her
information
,
and
*NL*
who
hoped
through
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
to
obtain
a
concession
,
told
*NL*
her
that
they
had
finished
their
business
and
were
going
away
next
day
.
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
already
begun
to
calm
down
,
when
the
next
morning
a
*NL*
note
was
brought
her
,
the
handwriting
of
which
she
recognized
with
*NL*
horror
.
It
was
the
handwriting
of
Anna
Karenina
.
The
envelope
was
of
*NL*
paper
as
thick
as
bark
;
on
the
oblong
yellow
paper
there
was
a
huge
*NL*
monogram
,
and
the
letter
smelt
of
agreeable
scent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
brought
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
commissionaire
from
the
hotel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
before
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
could
sit
down
to
read
*NL*
the
letter
.
Her
excitement
brought
on
an
attack
of
asthma
,
to
which
she
*NL*
was
subject
.
When
she
had
recovered
her
composure
,
she
read
the
*NL*
following
letter
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
la
Comtesse
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Christian
feelings
with
which
your
heart
is
filled
give
me
*NL*
the
,
I
feel
,
unpardonable
boldness
to
write
to
you
.
I
am
*NL*
miserable
at
being
separated
from
my
son
.
I
entreat
permission
*NL*
to
see
him
once
before
my
departure
.
Forgive
me
for
recalling
*NL*
myself
to
your
memory
.
I
apply
to
you
and
not
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
simply
because
I
do
not
wish
to
cause
that
*NL*
generous
man
to
suffer
in
remembering
me
.
Knowing
your
*NL*
friendship
for
him
,
I
know
you
will
understand
me
.
Could
you
*NL*
send
Seryozha
to
me
,
or
should
I
come
to
the
house
at
some
fixed
*NL*
hour
,
or
will
you
let
me
know
when
and
where
I
could
see
him
*NL*
away
from
home
?
I
do
not
anticipate
a
refusal
,
knowing
the
*NL*
magnanimity
of
him
with
whom
it
rests
.
You
can
not
conceive
the
*NL*
craving
I
have
to
see
him
,
and
so
can
not
conceive
the
gratitude
*NL*
your
help
will
arouse
in
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
in
this
letter
exasperated
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
:
its
*NL*
contents
and
the
allusion
to
magnanimity
,
and
especially
its
free
and
*NL*
easy
--
as
she
considered
--
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
there
is
no
answer
,
''
said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
and
*NL*
immediately
opening
her
blotting-book
,
she
wrote
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
that
she
hoped
to
see
him
at
one
o'clock
at
the
levee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
talk
with
you

a
grave

we

He
lays
the
cross

but
He
gives
the
strength
*NL*
to
bear
it
,
''
she
added
,
so
as
to
give
him
some
slight
preparation
.
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
usually
wrote
some
two
or
three
letters
a
day
to
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
She
enjoyed
that
form
of
communication
,
which
*NL*
gave
opportunity
for
a
refinement
and
air
of
mystery
not
afforded
by
*NL*
their
personal
interviews
.

The
levee
was
drawing
to
a
close
.
People
met
as
they
were
going
away
,
*NL*
and
gossiped
of
the
latest
news
,
of
the
newly
bestowed
honors
and
the
*NL*
changes
in
the
positions
of
the
higher
functionaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

Countess
Marya
Borissovna

of
War

said
a
gray-headed
,
little
old
man
*NL*
in
a
gold-embroidered
uniform
,
addressing
a
tall
,
handsome
maid
of
honor
*NL*
who
had
questioned
him
about
the
new
appointments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

adjutants

said
the
maid
of
honor
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

an
appointment
already

You

And

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day

prince

''
said
the
little
old
man
to
a
man
who
came
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
were
you
saying
of
Karenin
?

said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
``

thought

it
already

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Just

''
said
the
little
old
man
,
pointing
with
his
*NL*
embroidered
hat
to
Karenin
in
a
court
uniform
with
the
new
red
ribbon
*NL*
across
his
shoulders
,
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
hall
with
an
*NL*
influential
member
of
the
Imperial
Council
.
``
Pleased
and
happy
as
a
*NL*
brass
farthing

''
he
added
,
stopping
to
shake
hands
with
a
handsome
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
of
colossal
proportions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
's
looking

said
the
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

come

please
do

any

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

not

in
the
Morsky

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
C'est
un
homme
qui
n
'
a
pas
...
''
the
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
was
*NL*
beginning
,
but
he
stopped
to
make
room
,
bowing
,
for
a
member
of
the
*NL*
Imperial
family
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
people
talked
incessantly
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
finding
fault
*NL*
with
him
and
laughing
at
him
,
while
he
,
blocking
up
the
way
of
the
*NL*
member
of
the
Imperial
Council
he
had
captured
,
was
explaining
to
him
*NL*
point
by
point
his
new
financial
project
,
never
interrupting
his
*NL*
discourse
for
an
instant
for
fear
he
should
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
time
that
his
wife
left
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
there
*NL*
had
come
to
him
that
bitterest
moment
in
the
life
of
an
official
--
the
*NL*
moment
when
his
upward
career
comes
to
a
full
stop
.
This
full
stop
had
*NL*
arrived
and
everyone
perceived
it
,
but
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
himself
was
*NL*
not
yet
aware
that
his
career
was
over
.
Whether
it
was
due
to
his
feud
*NL*
with
Stremov
,
or
his
misfortune
with
his
wife
,
or
simply
that
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
had
reached
his
destined
limits
,
it
had
become
evident
to
*NL*
everyone
in
the
course
of
that
year
that
his
career
was
at
an
end
.
He
*NL*
still
filled
a
position
of
consequence
,
he
sat
on
many
commissions
and
*NL*
committees
,
but
he
was
a
man
whose
day
was
over
,
and
from
whom
nothing
*NL*
was
expected
.
Whatever
he
said
,
whatever
he
proposed
,
was
heard
as
*NL*
though
it
were
something
long
familiar
,
and
the
very
thing
that
was
not
*NL*
needed
.
But
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
not
aware
of
this
,
and
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
being
cut
off
from
direct
participation
in
governmental
*NL*
activity
,
he
saw
more
clearly
than
ever
the
errors
and
defects
in
the
*NL*
action
of
others
,
and
thought
it
his
duty
to
point
out
means
for
their
*NL*
correction
.
Shortly
after
his
separation
from
his
wife
,
he
began
writing
*NL*
his
first
note
on
the
new
judicial
procedure
,
the
first
of
the
endless
*NL*
series
of
notes
he
was
destined
to
write
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
did
not
merely
fail
to
observe
his
hopeless
*NL*
position
in
the
official
world
,
he
was
not
merely
free
from
anxiety
on
*NL*
this
head
,
he
was
positively
more
satisfied
than
ever
with
his
own
*NL*
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
that
is
unmarried
careth
for
the
things
that
belong
to
the
Lord
,
how
*NL*
he
may
please
the
Lord
:
But
he
that
is
married
careth
for
the
things
*NL*
that
are
of
the
world
,
how
he
may
please
his
wife
,
''
says
the
Apostle
*NL*
Paul
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
who
was
now
guided
in
every
action
by
*NL*
Scripture
,
often
recalled
this
text
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
ever
since
he
*NL*
had
been
left
without
a
wife
,
he
had
in
these
very
projects
of
reform
*NL*
been
serving
the
Lord
more
zealously
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unmistakable
impatience
of
the
member
of
the
Council
trying
to
get
*NL*
away
from
him
did
not
trouble
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
he
gave
up
his
*NL*
exposition
only
when
the
member
of
the
Council
,
seizing
his
chance
when
*NL*
one
of
the
Imperial
family
was
passing
,
slipped
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
looked
down
,
collecting
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
then
looked
casually
about
him
and
walked
towards
the
door
,
where
he
*NL*
hoped
to
meet
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
strong
they
all
are
,
how
sound
physically
,
''
thought
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
looking
at
the
powerfully
built
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
bedchamber
with
his
well-combed
,
perfumed
whiskers
,
and
at
the
red
neck
*NL*
of
the
prince
,
pinched
by
his
tight
uniform
.
He
had
to
pass
them
on
his
*NL*
way
.
``
Truly
is
it
said
that
all
the
world
is
evil
,
''
he
thought
,
with
*NL*
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
calves
of
the
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
bedchamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moving
forward
deliberately
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
bowed
with
his
*NL*
customary
air
of
weariness
and
dignity
to
the
gentleman
who
had
been
*NL*
talking
about
him
,
and
looking
towards
the
door
,
his
eyes
sought
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
!
''
said
the
little
old
man
,
with
a
malicious
*NL*
light
in
his
eyes
,
at
the
moment
when
Karenin
was
on
a
level
with
them
,
*NL*
and
was
nodding
with
a
frigid
gesture
,
``
I
have
n't
congratulated
you
*NL*
yet
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
pointing
to
his
newly
received
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
answered
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
What
an
_
exquisite
_
day
*NL*
today
,
''
he
added
,
laying
emphasis
in
his
peculiar
way
on
the
word
*NL*
_
exquisite
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
they
laughed
at
him
he
was
well
aware
,
but
he
did
not
expect
*NL*
anything
but
hostility
from
them
;
he
was
used
to
that
by
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catching
sight
of
the
yellow
shoulders
of
Lidia
Ivanovna
jutting
out
*NL*
above
her
corset
,
and
her
fine
pensive
eyes
bidding
him
to
her
,
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
smiled
,
revealing
untarnished
white
teeth
,
and
went
*NL*
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
dress
had
cost
her
great
pains
,
as
indeed
all
her
*NL*
dresses
had
done
of
late
.
Her
aim
in
dress
was
now
quite
the
reverse
of
*NL*
that
she
had
pursued
thirty
years
before
.
Then
her
desire
had
been
to
*NL*
adorn
herself
with
something
,
and
the
more
adorned
the
better
.
Now
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
she
was
perforce
decked
out
in
a
way
so
inconsistent
with
*NL*
her
age
and
her
figure
,
that
her
one
anxiety
was
to
contrive
that
the
*NL*
contrast
between
these
adornments
and
her
own
exterior
should
not
be
too
*NL*
appalling
.
And
as
far
as
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
was
concerned
she
*NL*
succeeded
,
and
was
in
his
eyes
attractive
.
For
him
she
was
the
one
*NL*
island
not
only
of
goodwill
to
him
,
but
of
love
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
*NL*
of
hostility
and
jeering
that
surrounded
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
through
rows
of
ironical
eyes
,
he
was
drawn
as
naturally
to
her
*NL*
loving
glance
as
a
plant
to
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
congratulate
you
,
''
she
said
to
him
,
her
eyes
on
his
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suppressing
a
smile
of
pleasure
,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
closing
his
*NL*
eyes
,
as
though
to
say
that
that
could
not
be
a
source
of
joy
to
him
.
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
very
well
aware
that
it
was
one
of
his
chief
*NL*
sources
of
satisfaction
,
though
he
never
admitted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
our
angel
?
''
said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
meaning
Seryozha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
I
was
quite
pleased
with
him
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
raising
his
eyebrows
and
opening
his
eyes
.
``
And
Sitnikov
is
not
*NL*
satisfied
with
him
.
''
-LRB-
Sitnikov
was
the
tutor
to
whom
Seryozha
's
secular
*NL*
education
had
been
intrusted
.
-RRB-
``
As
I
have
mentioned
to
you
,
there
's
a
*NL*
sort
of
coldness
in
him
towards
the
most
important
questions
which
ought
*NL*
to
touch
the
heart
of
every
man
and
every
child
...
''
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
began
expounding
his
views
on
the
sole
question
that
*NL*
interested
him
besides
the
service
--
the
education
of
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
with
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
help
had
been
brought
*NL*
back
anew
to
life
and
activity
,
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
undertake
the
*NL*
education
of
the
son
left
on
his
hands
.
Having
never
before
taken
any
*NL*
interest
in
educational
questions
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
devoted
some
*NL*
time
to
the
theoretical
study
of
the
subject
.
After
reading
several
*NL*
books
on
anthropology
,
education
,
and
didactics
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
drew
up
a
plan
of
education
,
and
engaging
the
best
tutor
in
Petersburg
*NL*
to
superintend
it
,
he
set
to
work
,
and
the
subject
continually
absorbed
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
heart
.
I
see
in
him
his
father
's
heart
,
and
with
such
a
*NL*
heart
a
child
can
not
go
far
wrong
,
''
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
with
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
...
As
for
me
,
I
do
my
duty
.
It
's
all
I
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
coming
to
me
,
''
said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
after
a
pause
;
``
we
*NL*
have
to
speak
of
a
subject
painful
for
you

I
would
give
anything
to
*NL*

spared
you
certain
memories

others
are
not

I
*NL*
have
received
a
letter
from

She

is
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
shuddered
at
the
allusion
to
his
wife
,
but
*NL*
immediately
his
face
assumed
the
deathlike
rigidity
which
expressed
*NL*
utter
helplessness
in
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
expecting
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
looked
at
him
ecstatically
,
and
tears
of
rapture
*NL*
at
the
greatness
of
his
soul
came
into
her
eyes

When
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
came
into
the
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
snug
*NL*
little
boudoir
,
decorated
with
old
china
and
hung
with
portraits
,
the
*NL*
lady
herself
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
changing
her
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cloth
was
laid
on
a
round
table
,
and
on
it
stood
a
china
tea
service
*NL*
and
a
silver
spirit-lamp
and
tea
kettle
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
looked
*NL*
idly
about
at
the
endless
familiar
portraits
which
adorned
the
room
,
and
*NL*
sitting
down
to
the
table
,
he
opened
a
New
Testament
lying
upon
it
.
The
*NL*
rustle
of
the
countess
's
silk
skirt
drew
his
attention
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
we
can
sit
quietly
,
''
said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
slipping
*NL*
hurriedly
with
an
agitated
smile
between
the
table
and
the
sofa
,
``
and
*NL*
talk
over
our
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
words
of
preparation
,
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
breathing
hard
*NL*
and
flushing
crimson
,
gave
into
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
hands
the
letter
*NL*
she
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reading
the
letter
,
he
sat
a
long
while
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
have
the
right
to
refuse
her
,
''
he
said
,
timidly
lifting
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
friend
,
you
never
see
evil
in
anyone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
see
that
all
is
evil
.
But
whether
it
is
just
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
showed
irresolution
,
and
a
seeking
for
counsel
,
support
,
and
*NL*
guidance
in
a
matter
he
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
interrupted
him
;
``
there
are
limits
to
*NL*
everything
.
I
can
understand
immorality
,
''
she
said
,
not
quite
*NL*
truthfully
,
since
she
never
could
understand
that
which
leads
women
to
*NL*
immorality
;
``
but
I
do
n't
understand
cruelty
:
to
whom

to
you
!
How
can
*NL*
she
stay
in
the
town
where
you
are
?
No
,
the
longer
one
lives
the
more
*NL*
one
learns
.
And
I
'm
learning
to
understand
your
loftiness
and
her
*NL*
baseness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
to
throw
a
stone
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
unmistakably
*NL*
pleased
with
the
part
he
had
to
play
.
``
I
have
forgiven
all
,
and
so
I
*NL*
can
not
deprive
her
of
what
is
exacted
by
love
in
her
--
by
her
love
for
*NL*
her
son

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
that
love

my
friend

Is
it
sincere

Admitting
that
you
have
*NL*
forgiven
--
that
you
forgive
--
have
we
the
right
to
work
on
the
feelings
of
*NL*
that
angel
?
He
looks
on
her
as
dead
.
He
prays
for
her
,
and
beseeches
God
*NL*
to
have
mercy
on
her
sins
.
And
it
is
better
so
.
But
now
what
will
he
*NL*
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
thought
of
that
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
evidently
*NL*
agreeing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
was
silent
.
She
*NL*
was
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ask
my
advice
,
''
she
said
,
having
finished
her
prayer
and
*NL*
uncovered
her
face
,
``
I
do
not
advise
you
to
do
this
.
Do
you
suppose
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
how
you
are
suffering
,
how
this
has
torn
open
your
wounds
?
But
*NL*
supposing
that
,
as
always
,
you
do
n't
think
of
yourself
,
what
can
it
lead
*NL*
to
?
--
to
fresh
suffering
for
you
,
to
torture
for
the
child
.
If
there
were
*NL*
a
trace
of
humanity
left
in
her
,
she
ought
not
to
wish
for
it
herself
.
*NL*
No

I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
I
advise
not
,
and
if
you
will
intrust
*NL*
it
to
me
,
I
will
write
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
consented
,
and
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
sent
*NL*
the
following
letter
in
French
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Madame
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
reminded
of
you
might
have
results
for
your
son
in
*NL*
leading
to
questions
on
his

not
be
answered
*NL*
without
implanting
in
the
child
's
soul
a
spirit
of
censure
*NL*
towards
what
should
be
for
him
sacred
,
and
therefore
I
beg
you
*NL*
to
interpret
your
husband
's
refusal
in
the
spirit
of
Christian
*NL*
love
.
I
pray
to
Almighty

to
have
mercy

This
letter
attained
the
secret
object
which
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
*NL*
concealed
from
herself
.
It
wounded
Anna
to
the
quick
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
his
part
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
on
returning
home
from
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
,
could
not
all
that
day
concentrate
himself
on
his
usual
*NL*
pursuits
,
and
find
that
spiritual
peace
of
one
saved
and
believing
which
*NL*
he
had
felt
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
his
wife
,
who
had
so
greatly
sinned
against
him
,
and
*NL*
towards
whom
he
had
been
so
saintly
,
as
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
so
*NL*
justly
told
him
,
ought
not
to
have
troubled
him
;
but
he
was
not
easy
;
he
*NL*
could
not
understand
the
book
he
was
reading
;
he
could
not
drive
away
*NL*
harassing
recollections
of
his
relations
with
her
,
of
the
mistake
which
,
*NL*
as
it
now
seemed
,
he
had
made
in
regard
to
her
.
The
memory
of
how
he
had
*NL*
received
her
confession
of
infidelity
on
their
way
home
from
the
races
*NL*
-LRB-
especially
that
he
had
insisted
only
on
the
observance
of
external
*NL*
decorum
,
and
had
not
sent
a
challenge
-RRB-
tortured
him
like
a
remorse
.
He
*NL*
was
tortured
too
by
the
thought
of
the
letter
he
had
written
her
;
and
*NL*
most
of
all
,
his
forgiveness
,
which
nobody
wanted
,
and
his
care
of
the
*NL*
other
man
's
child
made
his
heart
burn
with
shame
and
remorse
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
just
the
same
feeling
of
shame
and
regret
he
felt
now
,
as
he
*NL*
reviewed
all
his
past
with
her
,
recalling
the
awkward
words
in
which
,
*NL*
after
long
wavering
,
he
had
made
her
an
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
have
I
been
to
blame
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
And
this
question
*NL*
always
excited
another
question
in
him
--
whether
they
felt
differently
,
*NL*
did
their
loving
and
marrying
differently
,
these
Vronskys
and
Oblonskys
*NL*
...
these
gentlemen
of
the
bedchamber
,
with
their
fine
calves
.
And
there
*NL*
passed
before
his
mind
a
whole
series
of
these
mettlesome
,
vigorous
,
*NL*
self-confident
men
,
who
always
and
everywhere
drew
his
inquisitive
*NL*
attention
in
spite
of
himself
.
He
tried
to
dispel
these
thoughts
,
he
*NL*
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
living
for
this
transient
*NL*
life
,
but
for
the
life
of
eternity
,
and
that
there
was
peace
and
love
in
*NL*
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fact
that
he
had
in
this
transient
,
trivial
life
made
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
him
,
a
few
trivial
mistakes
tortured
him
as
though
the
eternal
*NL*
salvation
in
which
he
believed
had
no
existence
.
But
this
temptation
did
*NL*
not
last
long
,
and
soon
there
was
reestablished
once
more
in
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
's
soul
the
peace
and
the
elevation
by
virtue
of
which
he
*NL*
could
forget
what
he
did
not
want
to
remember
.

coming

rosy
and
good-humored
*NL*
from
his
walk
the
day
before
his
birthday
,
and
giving
his
overcoat
to
*NL*
the
tall
old
hall
porter
,
who
smiled
down
at
the
little
person
from
the
*NL*
height

long
figure

``

said
the

porter
with
a
good-humored
wink

``
Here

I
'll
take
it
off

``

stopping
in
the
doorway
leading
to
the
inner
*NL*
rooms
.
``
Take
it
off

But
Seryozha
,
though
he
heard
his
tutor
's
*NL*
feeble
voice
,
did
not
pay
attention
to
it
.
He
stood
keeping
hold
of
the
*NL*
hall
porter
's
belt
,
and
gazing
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
did
papa
do
what
he
wanted
for
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
porter
nodded
his
head
affirmatively
.
The
clerk
with
his
face
*NL*
tied
up
,
who
had
already
been
seven
times
to
ask
some
favor
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
interested
both
Seryozha
and
the
hall
porter
.
Seryozha
*NL*
had
come
upon
him
in
the
hall
,
and
had
heard
him
plaintively
beg
the
*NL*
hall
porter
to
announce
him
,
saying
that
he
and
his
children
had
death
*NL*
staring
them
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
then
Seryozha
,
having
met
him
a
second
time
in
the
hall
,
took
*NL*
great
interest
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
was
he
very
glad

''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad

I
should
think
so

Almost
dancing

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
anything
been
left

asked
Seryozha
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
the
hall-porter
;
then
with
a
shake
of
his
head
he
*NL*
whispered
,
``
Something
from
the
countess

''
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
understood
at
once
that
what
the
hall
porter
was
speaking
of
*NL*
was
a
present
from
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
for
his

*NL*
said
the
porter
,
hearing
the
tutor
's
steps
approaching
,
and
carefully
*NL*
taking
away
from
his
belt
the
little
hand
in
the
glove
half
pulled

*NL*
he
signed
with
his

*NL*
*NL*
``

answered
Seryozha
with
that
gay
and
*NL*
loving
smile
which
always
won
over
the
conscientious
Vassily
Lukitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
was
too
happy

everything
was

him

be
able

to
help
sharing
with
his
friend
the

the

good
fortune

*NL*
which
he
had
heard
during
his
walk
in
the
public
gardens
from
Lidia

Ivanovna

niece

This
piece
of
good
news
seemed
to
him
particularly
*NL*
important
from
its
coming
at
the
same
time
with
the
gladness
of
the
*NL*
bandaged
clerk
and
his
own
gladness
at
toys
having
come
for
him

It
*NL*
seemed
to
Seryozha
that
this
was
a
day
on
which
everyone
ought

glad

happy

To

People
have

already

``
And
is

''
said
the
porter
severely
and
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
fell
to
dreaming
,
gazing
up
at
the
face
of
the
porter
,
which
he
*NL*
had
thoroughly
studied
in
every
detail
,
especially
the
chin
that
hung
*NL*
down
between
the
gray
whiskers
,
never
seen
by
anyone
but
Seryozha
,
who
*NL*
saw
him
only
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
has
your
daughter
been
to
see
you
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
's
daughter
was
a
ballet
dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
she
to
come
on
week-days
?
They
've
their
lessons
to
learn
too
.
*NL*
And
you
've
your
lesson
,
sir
;
run
along

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
into
the
room
,
Seryozha
,
instead
of
sitting
down
to
his
*NL*
lessons
,
told
his
tutor
of
his
supposition
that
what
had
been
brought
*NL*
him
must
be
a
machine
.
``
What
do
you
think
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Vassily
Lukitch
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
*NL*
learning
the
grammar
lesson
for
the
teacher
,
who
was
coming
at
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
do
just
tell
me
,
Vassily
Lukitch
,
''
he
asked
suddenly
,
when
he
was
*NL*
seated
at
their
work
table
with
the
book
in
his
hands
,
``
what
is
greater
*NL*
than
the
Alexander
Nevsky
?
You
know
papa
's
received
the
Alexander
*NL*
Nevsky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vassily
Lukitch
replied
that
the
Vladimir
was
greater
than
the
Alexander
*NL*
Nevsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
higher
still
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
highest
of
all
is
the
Andrey
Pervozvanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
higher
than
the
Andrey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
do
n't
know
?
''
and
Seryozha
,
leaning
on
his
elbows
,
sank
into
*NL*
deep
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
meditations
were
of
the
most
complex
and
diverse
character
.
He
*NL*
imagined
his
father
's
having
suddenly
been
presented
with
both
the
*NL*
Vladimir
and
the
Andrey
today
,
and
in
consequence
being
much
better
*NL*
tempered
at
his
lesson
,
and
dreamed
how
,
when
he
was
grown
up
,
he
would
*NL*
himself
receive
all
the
orders
,
and
what
they
might
invent
higher
than
*NL*
the
Andrey
.
Directly
any
higher
order
were
invented
,
he
would
win
it
.
*NL*
They
would
make
a
higher
one
still
,
and
he
would
immediately
win
that
*NL*
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
passed
in
such
meditations
,
and
when
the
teacher
came
,
the
*NL*
lesson
about
the
adverbs
of
place
and
time
and
manner
of
action
was
not
*NL*
ready
,
and
the
teacher
was
not
only
displeased
,
but
hurt
.
This
touched
*NL*
Seryozha
.
He
felt
he
was
not
to
blame
for
not
having
learned
the
lesson
;
*NL*
however
much
he
tried
,
he
was
utterly
unable
to
do
that
.
As
long
as
the
*NL*
teacher
was
explaining
to
him
,
he
believed
him
and
seemed
to
comprehend
,
*NL*
but
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
,
he
was
positively
unable
to
recollect
*NL*
and
to
understand
that
the
short
and
familiar
word
``
suddenly
''
is
an
*NL*
adverb
of
manner
of
action
.
Still
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
disappointed
*NL*
the
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
chose
a
moment
when
the
teacher
was
looking
in
silence
at
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mihail
Ivanitch
,
when
is
your
birthday
?
''
he
asked
all
,
of
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
much
better
be
thinking
about
your
work
.
Birthdays
are
of
no
*NL*
importance
to
a
rational
being
.
It
's
a
day
like
any
other
on
which
one
*NL*
has
to
do
one
's
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
looked
intently
at
the
teacher
,
at
his
scanty
beard
,
at
his
*NL*
spectacles
,
which
had
slipped
down
below
the
ridge
on
his
nose
,
and
fell
*NL*
into
so
deep
a
reverie
that
he
heard
nothing
of
what
the
teacher
was
*NL*
explaining
to
him
.
He
knew
that
the
teacher
did
not
think
what
he
said
;
*NL*
he
felt
it
from
the
tone
in
which
it
was
said
.
``
But
why
have
they
all
*NL*
agreed
to
speak
just
in
the
same
manner
always
the
dreariest
and
most
*NL*
useless
stuff
?
Why
does
he
keep
me
off
;
why
does
n't
he
love
me
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
himself
mournfully
,
and
could
not
think
of
an
answer
.

Chapter
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lesson
with
the
grammar
teacher
came
his
father
's
lesson
.
*NL*
While
waiting
for
his
father
,
Seryozha
sat
at
the
table
playing
with
a
*NL*
penknife
,
and
fell
to
dreaming
.
Among
Seryozha
's
favorite
occupations
*NL*
was
searching
for
his
mother
during
his
walks
.
He
did
not
believe
in
*NL*
death
generally
,
and
in
her
death
in
particular
,
in
spite
of
what
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
had
told
him
and
his
father
had
confirmed
,
and
it
was
just
*NL*
because
of
that
,
and
after
he
had
been
told
she
was
dead
,
that
he
had
*NL*
begun
looking
for
her
when
out
for
a
walk
.
Every
woman
of
full
,
graceful
*NL*
figure
with
dark
hair
was
his
mother
.
At
the
sight
of
such
a
woman
such
*NL*
a
feeling
of
tenderness
was
stirred
within
him
that
his
breath
failed
*NL*
him
,
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
.
And
he
was
on
the
tiptoe
of
*NL*
expectation
that
she
would
come
up
to
him
,
would
lift
her
veil
.
All
her
*NL*
face
would
be
visible
,
she
would
smile
,
she
would
hug
him
,
he
would
*NL*
sniff
her
fragrance
,
feel
the
softness
of
her
arms
,
and
cry
with
*NL*
happiness
,
just
as
he
had
one
evening
lain
on
her
lap
while
she
tickled
*NL*
him
,
and
he
laughed
and
bit
her
white
,
ring-covered
fingers
.
Later
,
when
*NL*
he
accidentally
learned
from
his
old
nurse
that
his
mother
was
not
dead
,
*NL*
and
his
father
and
Lidia
Ivanovna
had
explained
to
him
that
she
was
dead
*NL*
to
him
because
she
was
wicked
-LRB-
which
he
could
not
possibly
believe
,
*NL*
because
he
loved
her
-RRB-
,
he
went
on
seeking
her
and
expecting
her
in
the
*NL*
same
way
.
That
day
in
the
public
gardens
there
had
been
a
lady
in
a
*NL*
lilac
veil
,
whom
he
had
watched
with
a
throbbing
heart
,
believing
it
to
*NL*
be
she
as
she
came
towards
them
along
the
path
.
The
lady
had
not
come
up
*NL*
to
them
,
but
had
disappeared
somewhere
.
That
day
,
more
intensely
than
*NL*
ever
,
Seryozha
felt
a
rush
of
love
for
her
,
and
now
,
waiting
for
his
*NL*
father
,
he
forgot
everything
,
and
cut
all
round
the
edge
of
the
table
*NL*
with
his
penknife
,
staring
straight
before
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
*NL*
dreaming
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
your
papa
!
''
said
Vassily
Lukitch
,
rousing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
jumped
up
and
went
up
to
his
father
,
and
kissing
his
hand
,
*NL*
looked
at
him
intently
,
trying
to
discover
signs
of
his
joy
at
receiving
*NL*
the
Alexander
Nevsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
a
nice
walk
?
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
sitting
down
in
*NL*
his
easy
chair
,
pulling
the
volume
of
the
Old
Testament
to
him
and
*NL*
opening
it
.
Although
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
had
more
than
once
told
*NL*
Seryozha
that
every
Christian
ought
to
know
Scripture
history
*NL*
thoroughly
,
he
often
referred
to
the
Bible
himself
during
the
lesson
,
*NL*
and
Seryozha
observed
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
very
nice
indeed
,
papa
,
''
said
Seryozha
,
sitting
sideways
on
*NL*
his
chair
and
rocking
it
,
which
was
forbidden
.
``
I
saw
Nadinka
''
-LRB-
Nadinka
*NL*
was
a
niece
of
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
who
was
being
brought
up
in
her
house
-RRB-
.
*NL*
``
She
told
me
you
'd
been
given
a
new
star
.
Are
you
glad
,
papa
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
,
do
n't
rock
your
chair
,
please
,
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
``
And
secondly
,
it
's
not
the
reward
that
's
precious
,
but
*NL*
the
work
itself
.
And
I
could
have
wished
you
understood
that
.
If
you
now
*NL*
are
going
to
work
,
to
study
in
order
to
win
a
reward
,
then
the
work
will
*NL*
seem
hard
to
you
;
but
when
you
work
''
-LRB-
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
thought
of
how
he
had
been
sustained
by
a
sense
of
duty
through
*NL*
the
wearisome
labor
of
the
morning
,
consisting
of
signing
one
hundred
*NL*
and
eighty
papers
-RRB-
,
``
loving
your
work
,
you
will
find
your
reward
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
's
eyes
,
that
had
been
shining
with
gaiety
and
tenderness
,
grew
*NL*
dull
and
dropped
before
his
father
's
gaze
.
This
was
the
same
*NL*
long-familiar
tone
his
father
always
took
with
him
,
and
Seryozha
had
*NL*
learned
by
now
to
fall
in
with
it
.
His
father
always
talked
to
him
--
so
*NL*
Seryozha
felt
--
as
though
he
were
addressing
some
boy
of
his
own
*NL*
imagination
,
one
of
those
boys
that
exist
in
books
,
utterly
unlike
*NL*
himself
.
And
Seryozha
always
tried
with
his
father
to
act
being
the
*NL*
story-book
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
understand
that
,
I
hope
?
''
said
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
papa
,
''
answered
Seryozha
,
acting
the
part
of
the
imaginary
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lesson
consisted
of
learning
by
heart
several
verses
out
of
the
*NL*
Gospel
and
the
repetition
of
the
beginning
of
the
Old
Testament
.
The
*NL*
verses
from
the
Gospel
Seryozha
knew
fairly
well
,
but
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
he
was
saying
them
he
became
so
absorbed
in
watching
the
sharply
*NL*
protruding
,
bony
knobbiness
of
his
father
's
forehead
,
that
he
lost
the
*NL*
thread
,
and
he
transposed
the
end
of
one
verse
and
the
beginning
of
*NL*
another
.
So
it
was
evident
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
that
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
what
he
was
saying
,
and
that
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
,
and
began
explaining
what
Seryozha
had
heard
many
times
*NL*
before
and
never
could
remember
,
because
he
understood
it
too
well
,
just
*NL*
as
that
``
suddenly
''
is
an
adverb
of
manner
of
action
.
Seryozha
looked
*NL*
with
scared
eyes
at
his
father
,
and
could
think
of
nothing
but
whether
*NL*
his
father
would
make
him
repeat
what
he
had
said
,
as
he
sometimes
did
.
*NL*
And
this
thought
so
alarmed
Seryozha
that
he
now
understood
nothing
.
But
*NL*
his
father
did
not
make
him
repeat
it
,
and
passed
on
to
the
lesson
out
*NL*
of
the
Old
Testament
.
Seryozha
recounted
the
events
themselves
well
*NL*
enough
,
but
when
he
had
to
answer
questions
as
to
what
certain
events
*NL*
prefigured
,
he
knew
nothing
,
though
he
had
already
been
punished
over
*NL*
this
lesson
.
The
passage
at
which
he
was
utterly
unable
to
say
anything
,
*NL*
and
began
fidgeting
and
cutting
the
table
and
swinging
his
chair
,
was
*NL*
where
he
had
to
repeat
the
patriarchs
before
the
Flood
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
one
of
them
,
except
Enoch
,
who
had
been
taken
up
alive
to
heaven
.
Last
*NL*
time
he
had
remembered
their
names
,
but
now
he
had
forgotten
them
*NL*
utterly
,
chiefly
because
Enoch
was
the
personage
he
liked
best
in
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
Old
Testament
,
and
Enoch
's
translation
to
heaven
was
*NL*
connected
in
his
mind
with
a
whole
long
train
of
thought
,
in
which
he
*NL*
became
absorbed
now
while
he
gazed
with
fascinated
eyes
at
his
father
's
*NL*
watch-chain
and
a
half-unbuttoned
button
on
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
death
,
of
which
they
talked
to
him
so
often
,
Seryozha
disbelieved
*NL*
entirely
.
He
did
not
believe
that
those
he
loved
could
die
,
above
all
*NL*
that
he
himself
would
die
.
That
was
to
him
something
utterly
*NL*
inconceivable
and
impossible
.
But
he
had
been
told
that
all
men
die
;
he
*NL*
had
asked
people
,
indeed
,
whom
he
trusted
,
and
they
too
,
had
confirmed
*NL*
it
;
his
old
nurse
,
too
,
said
the
same
,
though
reluctantly
.
But
Enoch
had
*NL*
not
died
,
and
so
it
followed
that
everyone
did
not
die
.
``
And
why
can
not
*NL*
anyone
else
so
serve
God
and
be
taken
alive
to
heaven
?
''
thought
*NL*
Seryozha
.
Bad
people
,
that
is
those
Seryozha
did
not
like
,
they
might
*NL*
die
,
but
the
good
might
all
be
like
Enoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
are
the
names
of
the
patriarchs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enoch
,
Enos
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
said
that
already
.
This
is
bad
,
Seryozha
,
very
bad
.
If
you
*NL*
do
n't
try
to
learn
what
is
more
necessary
than
anything
for
a
*NL*
Christian
,
''
said
his
father
,
getting
up
,
``
whatever
can
interest
you
?
I
*NL*
am
displeased
with
you
,
and
Piotr
Ignatitch
''
-LRB-
this
was
the
most
*NL*
important
of
his
teachers
-RRB-
``
is
displeased
with
you
...
I
shall
have
to
*NL*
punish
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
and
his
teacher
were
both
displeased
with
Seryozha
,
and
he
*NL*
certainly
did
learn
his
lessons
very
badly
.
But
still
it
could
not
be
*NL*
said
he
was
a
stupid
boy
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
far
cleverer
than
the
*NL*
boys
his
teacher
held
up
as
examples
to
Seryozha
.
In
his
father
's
*NL*
opinion
,
he
did
not
want
to
learn
what
he
was
taught
.
In
reality
he
*NL*
could
not
learn
that
.
He
could
not
,
because
the
claims
of
his
own
soul
*NL*
were
more
binding
on
him
than
those
claims
his
father
and
his
teacher
*NL*
made
upon
him
.
Those
claims
were
in
opposition
,
and
he
was
in
direct
*NL*
conflict
with
his
education
.
He
was
nine
years
old
;
he
was
a
child
;
but
*NL*
he
knew
his
own
soul
,
it
was
precious
to
him
,
he
guarded
it
as
the
*NL*
eyelid
guards
the
eye
,
and
without
the
key
of
love
he
let
no
one
into
*NL*
his
soul
.
His
teachers
complained
that
he
would
not
learn
,
while
his
*NL*
soul
was
brimming
over
with
thirst
for
knowledge
.
And
he
learned
from
*NL*
Kapitonitch
,
from
his
nurse
,
from
Nadinka
,
from
Vassily
Lukitch
,
but
not
*NL*
from
his
teachers
.
The
spring
his
father
and
his
teachers
reckoned
upon
*NL*
to
turn
their
mill-wheels
had
long
dried
up
at
the
source
,
but
its
*NL*
waters
did
their
work
in
another
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
punished
Seryozha
by
not
letting
him
go
to
see
Nadinka
,
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
's
niece
;
but
this
punishment
turned
out
happily
for
Seryozha
.
*NL*
Vassily
Lukitch
was
in
a
good
humor
,
and
showed
him
how
to
make
*NL*
windmills
.
The
whole
evening
passed
over
this
work
and
in
dreaming
how
*NL*
to
make
a
windmill
on
which
he
could
turn
himself
--
clutching
at
the
*NL*
sails
or
tying
himself
on
and
whirling
round
.
Of
his
mother
Seryozha
did
*NL*
not
think
all
the
evening
,
but
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
,
he
suddenly
*NL*
remembered
her
,
and
prayed
in
his
own
words
that
his
mother
tomorrow
for
*NL*
his
birthday
might
leave
off
hiding
herself
and
come
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vassily
Lukitch
,
do
you
know
what
I
prayed
for
tonight
extra
besides
*NL*
the
regular
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
might
learn
your
lessons
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Toys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
You
'll
never
guess
.
A
splendid
thing
;
but
it
's
a
secret
!
When
it
*NL*
comes
to
pass
I
'll
tell
you
.
Ca
n't
you
guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
guess
.
You
tell
me
,
''
said
Vassily
Lukitch
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
which
was
rare
with
him
.
``
Come
,
lie
down
,
I
'm
putting
out
the
candle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
the
candle
I
can
see
better
what
I
see
and
what
I
prayed
for
.
*NL*
There
!
I
was
almost
telling
the
secret
!
''
said
Seryozha
,
laughing
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
candle
was
taken
away
,
Seryozha
heard
and
felt
his
mother
.
She
*NL*
stood
over
him
,
and
with
loving
eyes
caressed
him
.
But
then
came
*NL*
windmills
,
a
knife
,
everything
began
to
be
mixed
up
,
and
he
fell
asleep
.

Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
in
Petersburg
,
Vronsky
and
Anna
stayed
at
one
of
the
best
*NL*
hotels
;
Vronsky
apart
in
a
lower
story
,
Anna
above
with
her
child
,
its
*NL*
nurse
,
and
her
maid
,
in
a
large
suite
of
four
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
of
his
arrival
Vronsky
went
to
his
brother
's
.
There
he
found
*NL*
his
mother
,
who
had
come
from
Moscow
on
business
.
His
mother
and
*NL*
sister-in-law
greeted
him
as
usual
:
they
asked
him
about
his
stay
*NL*
abroad
,
and
talked
of
their
common
acquaintances
,
but
did
not
let
drop
a
*NL*
single
word
in
allusion
to
his
connection
with
Anna
.
His
brother
came
*NL*
the
next
morning
to
see
Vronsky
,
and
of
his
own
accord
asked
him
about
*NL*
her
,
and
Alexey
Vronsky
told
him
directly
that
he
looked
upon
his
*NL*
connection
with
Madame
Karenina
as
marriage
;
that
he
hoped
to
arrange
a
*NL*
divorce
,
and
then
to
marry
her
,
and
until
then
he
considered
her
as
much
*NL*
a
wife
as
any
other
wife
,
and
he
begged
him
to
tell
their
mother
and
his
*NL*
wife
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
world
disapproves
,
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Vronsky
;
``
but
if
my
*NL*
relations
want
to
be
on
terms
of
relationship
with
me
,
they
will
have
to
*NL*
be
on
the
same
terms
with
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
brother
,
who
had
always
a
respect
for
his
younger
brother
's
*NL*
judgment
,
could
not
well
tell
whether
he
was
right
or
not
till
the
world
*NL*
had
decided
the
question
;
for
his
part
he
had
nothing
against
it
,
and
*NL*
with
Alexey
he
went
up
to
see
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
his
brother
,
as
before
everyone
,
Vronsky
addressed
Anna
with
a
*NL*
certain
formality
,
treating
her
as
he
might
a
very
intimate
friend
,
but
*NL*
it
was
understood
that
his
brother
knew
their
real
relations
,
and
they
*NL*
talked
about
Anna
's
going
to
Vronsky
's
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
his
social
experience
Vronsky
was
,
in
consequence
of
the
*NL*
new
position
in
which
he
was
placed
,
laboring
under
a
strange
*NL*
misapprehension
.
One
would
have
thought
he
must
have
understood
that
*NL*
society
was
closed
for
him
and
Anna
;
but
now
some
vague
ideas
had
sprung
*NL*
up
in
his
brain
that
this
was
only
the
case
in
old-fashioned
days
,
and
*NL*
that
now
with
the
rapidity
of
modern
progress
-LRB-
he
had
unconsciously
*NL*
become
by
now
a
partisan
of
every
sort
of
progress
-RRB-
the
views
of
society
*NL*
had
changed
,
and
that
the
question
whether
they
would
be
received
in
*NL*
society
was
not
a
foregone
conclusion
.
``
Of
course
,
''
he
thought
,
``
she
*NL*
would
not
be
received
at
court
,
but
intimate
friends
can
and
must
look
*NL*
at
it
in
the
proper
light
.
''
One
may
sit
for
several
hours
at
a
stretch
*NL*
with
one
's
legs
crossed
in
the
same
position
,
if
one
knows
that
there
's
*NL*
nothing
to
prevent
one
's
changing
one
's
position
;
but
if
a
man
knows
*NL*
that
he
must
remain
sitting
so
with
crossed
legs
,
then
cramps
come
on
,
*NL*
the
legs
begin
to
twitch
and
to
strain
towards
the
spot
to
which
one
*NL*
would
like
to
draw
them
.
This
was
what
Vronsky
was
experiencing
in
*NL*
regard
to
the
world
.
Though
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
that
the
*NL*
world
was
shut
on
them
,
he
put
it
to
the
test
whether
the
world
had
not
*NL*
changed
by
now
and
would
not
receive
them
.
But
he
very
quickly
perceived
*NL*
that
though
the
world
was
open
for
him
personally
,
it
was
closed
for
*NL*
Anna
.
Just
as
in
the
game
of
cat
and
mouse
,
the
hands
raised
for
him
*NL*
were
dropped
to
bar
the
way
for
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
first
ladies
of
Petersburg
society
whom
Vronsky
saw
was
his
*NL*
cousin
Betsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
!
''
she
greeted
him
joyfully
.
``
And
Anna
?
How
glad
I
am
!
Where
are
*NL*
you
stopping
?
I
can
fancy
after
your
delightful
travels
you
must
find
*NL*
our
poor
Petersburg
horrid
.
I
can
fancy
your
honeymoon
in
Rome
.
How
*NL*
about
the
divorce
?
Is
that
all
over
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
noticed
that
Betsy
's
enthusiasm
waned
when
she
learned
that
no
*NL*
divorce
had
as
yet
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
will
throw
stones
at
me
,
I
know
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
I
shall
come
*NL*
and
see
Anna
;
yes
,
I
shall
certainly
come
.
You
wo
n't
be
here
long
,
I
*NL*
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
did
certainly
come
to
see
Anna
the
same
day
,
but
her
tone
was
*NL*
not
at
all
the
same
as
in
former
days
.
She
unmistakably
prided
herself
*NL*
on
her
courage
,
and
wished
Anna
to
appreciate
the
fidelity
of
her
*NL*
friendship
.
She
only
stayed
ten
minutes
,
talking
of
society
gossip
,
and
*NL*
on
leaving
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
never
told
me
when
the
divorce
is
to
be
?
Supposing
I
'm
ready
to
*NL*
fling
my
cap
over
the
mill
,
other
starchy
people
will
give
you
the
cold
*NL*
shoulder
until
you
're
married
.
And
that
's
so
simple
nowadays
.
_
Ca
se
*NL*
fait
_
.
So
you
're
going
on
Friday
?
Sorry
we
sha
n't
see
each
other
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
Betsy
's
tone
Vronsky
might
have
grasped
what
he
had
to
expect
from
*NL*
the
world
;
but
he
made
another
effort
in
his
own
family
.
His
mother
he
*NL*
did
not
reckon
upon
.
He
knew
that
his
mother
,
who
had
been
so
*NL*
enthusiastic
over
Anna
at
their
first
acquaintance
,
would
have
no
mercy
*NL*
on
her
now
for
having
ruined
her
son
's
career
.
But
he
had
more
hope
of
*NL*
Varya
,
his
brother
's
wife
.
He
fancied
she
would
not
throw
stones
,
and
*NL*
would
go
simply
and
directly
to
see
Anna
,
and
would
receive
her
in
her
*NL*
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
his
arrival
Vronsky
went
to
her
,
and
finding
her
alone
,
*NL*
expressed
his
wishes
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Alexey
,
''
she
said
after
hearing
him
,
``
how
fond
I
am
of
you
,
*NL*
and
how
ready
I
am
to
do
anything
for
you
;
but
I
have
not
spoken
,
*NL*
because
I
knew
I
could
be
of
no
use
to
you
and
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
articulating
the
name
``
Anna
Arkadyevna
''
with
particular
care
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
suppose
,
please
,
that
I
judge
her
.
Never
;
perhaps
in
her
place
I
*NL*
should
have
done
the
same
.
I
do
n't
and
ca
n't
enter
into
that
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
glancing
timidly
at
his
gloomy
face
.
``
But
one
must
call
things
by
their
*NL*
names
.
You
want
me
to
go
and
see
her
,
to
ask
her
here
,
and
to
*NL*
rehabilitate
her
in
society
;
but
do
understand
that
I
_
can
not
_
do
so
.
I
*NL*
have
daughters
growing
up
,
and
I
must
live
in
the
world
for
my
husband
's
*NL*
sake
.
Well
,
I
'm
ready
to
come
and
see
Anna
Arkadyevna
:
she
will
*NL*
understand
that
I
ca
n't
ask
her
here
,
or
I
should
have
to
do
so
in
such
*NL*
a
way
that
she
would
not
meet
people
who
look
at
things
differently
;
*NL*
that
would
offend
her
.
I
ca
n't
raise
her
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
regard
her
as
fallen
more
than
hundreds
of
women
you
do
*NL*
receive
!
''
Vronsky
interrupted
her
still
more
gloomily
,
and
he
got
up
in
*NL*
silence
,
understanding
that
his
sister-in-law
's
decision
was
not
to
be
*NL*
shaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
!
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
.
Please
understand
that
I
'm
not
to
*NL*
blame
,
''
began
Varya
,
looking
at
him
with
a
timid
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
angry
with
you
,
''
he
said
still
as
gloomily
;
``
but
I
'm
sorry
in
*NL*
two
ways
.
I
'm
sorry
,
too
,
that
this
means
breaking
up
our
friendship
--
if
*NL*
not
breaking
up
,
at
least
weakening
it
.
You
will
understand
that
for
me
,
*NL*
too
,
it
can
not
be
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
knew
that
further
efforts
were
useless
,
and
that
he
had
to
spend
*NL*
these
few
days
in
Petersburg
as
though
in
a
strange
town
,
avoiding
every
*NL*
sort
of
relation
with
his
own
old
circle
in
order
not
to
be
exposed
to
*NL*
the
annoyances
and
humiliations
which
were
so
intolerable
to
him
.
One
of
*NL*
the
most
unpleasant
features
of
his
position
in
Petersburg
was
that
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
his
name
seemed
to
meet
him
everywhere
.
He
*NL*
could
not
begin
to
talk
of
anything
without
the
conversation
turning
on
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
;
he
could
not
go
anywhere
without
risk
of
meeting
*NL*
him
.
So
at
least
it
seemed
to
Vronsky
,
just
as
it
seems
to
a
man
with
a
*NL*
sore
finger
that
he
is
continually
,
as
though
on
purpose
,
grazing
his
*NL*
sore
finger
on
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
stay
in
Petersburg
was
the
more
painful
to
Vronsky
that
he
*NL*
perceived
all
the
time
a
sort
of
new
mood
that
he
could
not
understand
*NL*
in
Anna
.
At
one
time
she
would
seem
in
love
with
him
,
and
then
she
would
*NL*
become
cold
,
irritable
,
and
impenetrable
.
She
was
worrying
over
*NL*
something
,
and
keeping
something
back
from
him
,
and
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
notice
the
humiliations
which
poisoned
his
existence
,
and
for
her
,
with
*NL*
her
delicate
intuition
,
must
have
been
still
more
unbearable
.

*NL*
Chapter
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
Anna
's
objects
in
coming
back
to
Russia
had
been
to
see
her
son
.
*NL*
From
the
day
she
left
Italy
the
thought
of
it
had
never
ceased
to
*NL*
agitate
her
.
And
as
she
got
nearer
to
Petersburg
,
the
delight
and
*NL*
importance
of
this
meeting
grew
ever
greater
in
her
imagination
.
She
did
*NL*
not
even
put
to
herself
the
question
how
to
arrange
it
.
It
seemed
to
her
*NL*
natural
and
simple
to
see
her
son
when
she
should
be
in
the
same
town
*NL*
with
him
.
But
on
her
arrival
in
Petersburg
she
was
suddenly
made
*NL*
distinctly
aware
of
her
present
position
in
society
,
and
she
grasped
the
*NL*
fact
that
to
arrange
this
meeting
was
no
easy
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
now
been
two
days
in
Petersburg
.
The
thought
of
her
son
never
*NL*
left
her
for
a
single
instant
,
but
she
had
not
yet
seen
him
.
To
go
*NL*
straight
to
the
house
,
where
she
might
meet
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
that
*NL*
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
do
.
She
might
be
refused
admittance
and
*NL*
insulted
.
To
write
and
so
enter
into
relations
with
her
husband
--
that
it
*NL*
made
her
miserable
to
think
of
doing
;
she
could
only
be
at
peace
when
*NL*
she
did
not
think
of
her
husband
.
To
get
a
glimpse
of
her
son
out
*NL*
walking
,
finding
out
where
and
when
he
went
out
,
was
not
enough
for
her
;
*NL*
she
had
so
looked
forward
to
this
meeting
,
she
had
so
much
she
must
say
*NL*
to
him
,
she
so
longed
to
embrace
him
,
to
kiss
him
.
Seryozha
's
old
nurse
*NL*
might
be
a
help
to
her
and
show
her
what
to
do
.
But
the
nurse
was
not
*NL*
now
living
in
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
's
house
.
In
this
uncertainty
,
and
in
*NL*
efforts
to
find
the
nurse
,
two
days
had
slipped
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
of
the
close
intimacy
between
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
Countess
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
Anna
decided
on
the
third
day
to
write
to
her
a
letter
,
*NL*
which
cost
her
great
pains
,
and
in
which
she
intentionally
said
that
*NL*
permission
to
see
her
son
must
depend
on
her
husband
's
generosity
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
if
the
letter
were
shown
to
her
husband
,
he
would
keep
up
his
*NL*
character
of
magnanimity
,
and
would
not
refuse
her
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
commissionaire
who
took
the
letter
had
brought
her
back
the
most
*NL*
cruel
and
unexpected
answer
,
that
there
was
no
answer
.
She
had
never
*NL*
felt
so
humiliated
as
at
the
moment
when
,
sending
for
the
*NL*
commissionaire
,
she
heard
from
him
the
exact
account
of
how
he
had
*NL*
waited
,
and
how
afterwards
he
had
been
told
there
was
no
answer
.
Anna
*NL*
felt
humiliated
,
insulted
,
but
she
saw
that
from
her
point
of
view
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
right
.
Her
suffering
was
the
more
poignant
*NL*
that
she
had
to
bear
it
in
solitude
.
She
could
not
and
would
not
share
*NL*
it
with
Vronsky
.
She
knew
that
to
him
,
although
he
was
the
primary
cause
*NL*
of
her
distress
,
the
question
of
her
seeing
her
son
would
seem
a
matter
*NL*
of
very
little
consequence
.
She
knew
that
he
would
never
be
capable
of
*NL*
understanding
all
the
depth
of
her
suffering
,
that
for
his
cool
tone
at
*NL*
any
allusion
to
it
she
would
begin
to
hate
him
.
And
she
dreaded
that
*NL*
more
than
anything
in
the
world
,
and
so
she
hid
from
him
everything
that
*NL*
related
to
her
son
.
Spending
the
whole
day
at
home
she
considered
ways
*NL*
of
seeing
her
son
,
and
had
reached
a
decision
to
write
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
She
was
just
composing
this
letter
when
she
was
handed
the
letter
from
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
The
countess
's
silence
had
subdued
and
depressed
her
,
*NL*
but
the
letter
,
all
that
she
read
between
the
lines
in
it
,
so
*NL*
exasperated
her
,
this
malice
was
so
revolting
beside
her
passionate
,
*NL*
legitimate
tenderness
for
her
son
,
that
she
turned
against
other
people
*NL*
and
left
off
blaming
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
coldness
--
this
pretense
of
feeling
!
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
They
*NL*
must
needs
insult
me
and
torture
the
child
,
and
I
am
to
submit
to
it
!
*NL*
Not
on
any
consideration
!
She
is
worse
than
I
am
.
I
do
n't
lie
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
And
she
decided
on
the
spot
that
next
day
,
Seryozha
's
birthday
,
she
*NL*
would
go
straight
to
her
husband
's
house
,
bribe
or
deceive
the
servants
,
*NL*
but
at
any
cost
see
her
son
and
overturn
the
hideous
deception
with
*NL*
which
they
were
encompassing
the
unhappy
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
a
toy
shop
,
bought
toys
and
thought
over
a
plan
of
action
.
*NL*
She
would
go
early
in
the
morning
at
eight
o'clock
,
when
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
would
be
certain
not
to
be
up
.
She
would
have
money
in
*NL*
her
hand
to
give
the
hall
porter
and
the
footman
,
so
that
they
should
*NL*
let
her
in
,
and
not
raising
her
veil
,
she
would
say
that
she
had
come
*NL*
from
Seryozha
's
godfather
to
congratulate
him
,
and
that
she
had
been
*NL*
charged
to
leave
the
toys
at
his
bedside
.
She
had
prepared
everything
*NL*
but
the
words
she
should
say
to
her
son
.
Often
as
she
had
dreamed
of
it
,
*NL*
she
could
never
think
of
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
Anna
got
out
of
a
hired
*NL*
sledge
and
rang
at
the
front
entrance
of
her
former
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
and
see
what
's
wanted
.
Some
lady
,
''
said
Kapitonitch
,
who
,
not
yet
*NL*
dressed
,
in
his
overcoat
and
galoshes
,
had
peeped
out
of
the
window
and
*NL*
seen
a
lady
in
a
veil
standing
close
up
to
the
door
.
His
assistant
,
a
*NL*
lad
Anna
did
not
know
,
had
no
sooner
opened
the
door
to
her
than
she
*NL*
came
in
,
and
pulling
a
three-rouble
note
out
of
her
muff
put
it
*NL*
hurriedly
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
--
Sergey
Alexeitch
,
''
she
said
,
and
was
going
on
.
Scrutinizing
*NL*
the
note
,
the
porter
's
assistant
stopped
her
at
the
second
glass
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
want
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
his
words
and
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
the
embarrassment
of
the
unknown
lady
,
Kapitonitch
went
out
to
*NL*
her
,
opened
the
second
door
for
her
,
and
asked
her
what
she
was
pleased
*NL*
to
want
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Prince
Skorodumov
for
Sergey
Alexeitch
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
honor
's
not
up
yet
,
''
said
the
porter
,
looking
at
her
attentively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
not
anticipated
that
the
absolutely
unchanged
hall
of
the
house
*NL*
where
she
had
lived
for
nine
years
would
so
greatly
affect
her
.
Memories
*NL*
sweet
and
painful
rose
one
after
another
in
her
heart
,
and
for
a
moment
*NL*
she
forgot
what
she
was
here
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
kindly
wait
?
''
said
Kapitonitch
,
taking
off
her
fur
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
took
off
the
cloak
,
Kapitonitch
glanced
at
her
face
,
recognized
*NL*
her
,
and
made
her
a
low
bow
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
walk
in
,
your
excellency
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
say
something
,
but
her
voice
refused
to
utter
any
sound
;
*NL*
with
a
guilty
and
imploring
glance
at
the
old
man
she
went
with
light
,
*NL*
swift
steps
up
the
stairs
.
Bent
double
,
and
his
galoshes
catching
in
the
*NL*
steps
,
Kapitonitch
ran
after
her
,
trying
to
overtake
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tutor
's
there
;
maybe
he
's
not
dressed
.
I
'll
let
him
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
still
mounted
the
familiar
staircase
,
not
understanding
what
the
*NL*
old
man
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
to
the
left
,
if
you
please
.
Excuse
its
not
being
tidy
.
His
*NL*
honor
's
in
the
old
parlor
now
,
''
the
hall
porter
said
,
panting
.
``
Excuse
*NL*
me
,
wait
a
little
,
your
excellency
;
I
'll
just
see
,
''
he
said
,
and
*NL*
overtaking
her
,
he
opened
the
high
door
and
disappeared
behind
it
.
Anna
*NL*
stood
still
waiting
.
``
He
's
only
just
awake
,
''
said
the
hall
porter
,
*NL*
coming
out
.
And
at
the
very
instant
the
porter
said
this
,
Anna
caught
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
childish
yawn
.
From
the
sound
of
this
yawn
alone
she
knew
*NL*
her
son
and
seemed
to
see
him
living
before
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
in
;
go
away
!
''
she
said
,
and
went
in
through
the
high
doorway
.
On
*NL*
the
right
of
the
door
stood
a
bed
,
and
sitting
up
in
the
bed
was
the
*NL*
boy
.
His
little
body
bent
forward
with
his
nightshirt
unbuttoned
,
he
was
*NL*
stretching
and
still
yawning
.
The
instant
his
lips
came
together
they
*NL*
curved
into
a
blissfully
sleepy
smile
,
and
with
that
smile
he
slowly
and
*NL*
deliciously
rolled
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
!
''
she
whispered
,
going
noiselessly
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
parted
from
him
,
and
all
this
latter
time
when
she
had
been
*NL*
feeling
a
fresh
rush
of
love
for
him
,
she
had
pictured
him
as
he
was
at
*NL*
four
years
old
,
when
she
had
loved
him
most
of
all
.
Now
he
was
not
even
*NL*
the
same
as
when
she
had
left
him
;
he
was
still
further
from
the
*NL*
four-year-old
baby
,
more
grown
and
thinner
.
How
thin
his
face
was
,
how
*NL*
short
his
hair
was
!
What
long
hands
!
How
he
had
changed
since
she
left
*NL*
him
!
But
it
was
he
with
his
head
,
his
lips
,
his
soft
neck
and
broad
*NL*
little
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
!
''
she
repeated
just
in
the
child
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
himself
again
on
his
elbow
,
turned
his
tangled
head
from
side
*NL*
to
side
as
though
looking
for
something
,
and
opened
his
eyes
.
Slowly
and
*NL*
inquiringly
he
looked
for
several
seconds
at
his
mother
standing
*NL*
motionless
before
him
,
then
all
at
once
he
smiled
a
blissful
smile
,
and
*NL*
shutting
his
eyes
,
rolled
not
backwards
but
towards
her
into
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
!
my
darling
boy
!
''
she
said
,
breathing
hard
and
putting
her
*NL*
arms
round
his
plump
little
body
.
``
Mother
!
''
he
said
,
wriggling
about
in
*NL*
her
arms
so
as
to
touch
her
hands
with
different
parts
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
sleepily
still
with
closed
eyes
,
he
flung
fat
little
arms
round
*NL*
her
shoulders
,
rolled
towards
her
,
with
the
delicious
sleepy
warmth
and
*NL*
fragrance
that
is
only
found
in
children
,
and
began
rubbing
his
face
*NL*
against
her
neck
and
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
he
said
,
opening
his
eyes
;
``
it
's
my
birthday
today
.
I
knew
*NL*
you
'd
come
.
I
'll
get
up
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
saying
that
he
dropped
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
looked
at
him
hungrily
;
she
saw
how
he
had
grown
and
changed
in
her
*NL*
absence
.
She
knew
,
and
did
not
know
,
the
bare
legs
so
long
now
,
that
*NL*
were
thrust
out
below
the
quilt
,
those
short-cropped
curls
on
his
neck
*NL*
in
which
she
had
so
often
kissed
him
.
She
touched
all
this
and
could
say
*NL*
nothing
;
tears
choked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
crying
for
,
mother
?
''
he
said
,
waking
completely
up
.
*NL*
``
Mother
,
what
are
you
crying
for
?
''
he
cried
in
a
tearful
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
cry
...
I
'm
crying
for
joy
.
It
's
so
long
since
I
've
seen
you
.
I
*NL*
wo
n't
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
she
said
,
gulping
down
her
tears
and
turning
away
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
it
's
time
for
you
to
dress
now
,
''
she
added
,
after
a
pause
,
and
,
*NL*
never
letting
go
his
hands
,
she
sat
down
by
his
bedside
on
the
chair
,
*NL*
where
his
clothes
were
put
ready
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
dress
without
me
?
How
...
''
she
tried
to
begin
talking
simply
*NL*
and
cheerfully
,
but
she
could
not
,
and
again
she
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
have
a
cold
bath
,
papa
did
n't
order
it
.
And
you
've
not
seen
*NL*
Vassily
Lukitch
?
He
'll
come
in
soon
.
Why
,
you
're
sitting
on
my
clothes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Seryozha
went
off
into
a
peal
of
laughter
.
She
looked
at
him
and
*NL*
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
darling
,
sweet
one
!
''
he
shouted
,
flinging
himself
on
her
again
*NL*
and
hugging
her
.
It
was
as
though
only
now
,
on
seeing
her
smile
,
he
*NL*
fully
grasped
what
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
that
on
,
''
he
said
,
taking
off
her
hat
.
And
as
it
were
,
*NL*
seeing
her
afresh
without
her
hat
,
he
fell
to
kissing
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
you
think
about
me
?
You
did
n't
think
I
was
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
believed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
believe
it
,
my
sweet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
,
I
knew
!
''
he
repeated
his
favorite
phrase
,
and
snatching
the
*NL*
hand
that
was
stroking
his
hair
,
he
pressed
the
open
palm
to
his
mouth
*NL*
and
kissed
it
.

Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Vassily
Lukitch
had
not
at
first
understood
who
this
lady
was
,
*NL*
and
had
learned
from
their
conversation
that
it
was
no
other
person
than
*NL*
the
mother
who
had
left
her
husband
,
and
whom
he
had
not
seen
,
as
he
had
*NL*
entered
the
house
after
her
departure
.
He
was
in
doubt
whether
to
go
in
*NL*
or
not
,
or
whether
to
communicate
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
Reflecting
*NL*
finally
that
his
duty
was
to
get
Seryozha
up
at
the
hour
fixed
,
and
that
*NL*
it
was
therefore
not
his
business
to
consider
who
was
there
,
the
mother
*NL*
or
anyone
else
,
but
simply
to
do
his
duty
,
he
finished
dressing
,
went
to
*NL*
the
door
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
embraces
of
the
mother
and
child
,
the
sound
of
their
voices
,
and
*NL*
what
they
were
saying
,
made
him
change
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
,
and
with
a
sigh
he
closed
the
door
.
``
I
'll
wait
*NL*
another
ten
minutes
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
clearing
his
throat
and
wiping
*NL*
away
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
servants
of
the
household
there
was
intense
excitement
all
*NL*
this
time
.
All
had
heard
that
their
mistress
had
come
,
and
that
*NL*
Kapitonitch
had
let
her
in
,
and
that
she
was
even
now
in
the
nursery
,
*NL*
and
that
their
master
always
went
in
person
to
the
nursery
at
nine
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
every
one
fully
comprehended
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
*NL*
husband
and
wife
to
meet
,
and
that
they
must
prevent
it
.
Korney
,
the
*NL*
valet
,
going
down
to
the
hall
porter
's
room
,
asked
who
had
let
her
in
,
*NL*
and
how
it
was
he
had
done
so
,
and
ascertaining
that
Kapitonitch
had
*NL*
admitted
her
and
shown
her
up
,
he
gave
the
old
man
a
talking-to
.
The
*NL*
hall
porter
was
doggedly
silent
,
but
when
Korney
told
him
he
ought
to
be
*NL*
sent
away
,
Kapitonitch
darted
up
to
him
,
and
waving
his
hands
in
*NL*
Korney
's
face
,
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
to
be
sure
you
'd
not
have
let
her
in
!
After
ten
years
'
service
,
*NL*
and
never
a
word
but
of
kindness
,
and
there
you
'd
up
and
say
,
`
Be
off
,
*NL*
go
along
,
get
away
with
you
!
'
Oh
yes
,
you
're
a
shrewd
one
at
politics
,
I
*NL*
dare
say
!
You
do
n't
need
to
be
taught
how
to
swindle
the
master
,
and
to
*NL*
filch
fur
coats
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soldier
!
''
said
Korney
contemptuously
,
and
he
turned
to
the
nurse
who
*NL*
was
coming
in
.
``
Here
,
what
do
you
think
,
Marya
Efimovna
:
he
let
her
in
*NL*
without
a
word
to
anyone
,
''
Korney
said
addressing
her
.
``
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
will
be
down
immediately
--
and
go
into
the
nursery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
business
,
a
pretty
business
!
''
said
the
nurse
.
``
You
,
Korney
*NL*
Vassilievitch
,
you
'd
best
keep
him
some
way
or
other
,
the
master
,
while
*NL*
I
'll
run
and
get
her
away
somehow
.
A
pretty
business
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
nurse
went
into
the
nursery
,
Seryozha
was
telling
his
mother
*NL*
how
he
and
Nadinka
had
had
a
fall
in
sledging
downhill
,
and
had
turned
*NL*
over
three
times
.
She
was
listening
to
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
watching
*NL*
his
face
and
the
play
of
expression
on
it
,
touching
his
hand
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
follow
what
he
was
saying
.
She
must
go
,
she
must
leave
*NL*
him
,
--
this
was
the
only
thing
she
was
thinking
and
feeling
.
She
heard
*NL*
the
steps
of
Vassily
Lukitch
coming
up
to
the
door
and
coughing
;
she
*NL*
heard
,
too
,
the
steps
of
the
nurse
as
she
came
near
;
but
she
sat
like
*NL*
one
turned
to
stone
,
incapable
of
beginning
to
speak
or
to
get
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
,
darling
!
''
began
the
nurse
,
going
up
to
Anna
and
kissing
her
*NL*
hands
and
shoulders
.
``
God
has
brought
joy
indeed
to
our
boy
on
his
*NL*
birthday
.
You
are
n't
changed
one
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nurse
dear
,
I
did
n't
know
you
were
in
the
house
,
''
said
Anna
,
*NL*
rousing
herself
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
living
here
,
I
'm
living
with
my
daughter
.
I
came
for
the
*NL*
birthday
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
suddenly
burst
into
tears
,
and
began
kissing
her
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
,
with
radiant
eyes
and
smiles
,
holding
his
mother
by
one
hand
*NL*
and
his
nurse
by
the
other
,
pattered
on
the
rug
with
his
fat
little
bare
*NL*
feet
.
The
tenderness
shown
by
his
beloved
nurse
to
his
mother
threw
him
*NL*
into
an
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
She
often
comes
to
see
me
,
and
when
she
comes
...
''
he
was
*NL*
beginning
,
but
he
stopped
,
noticing
that
the
nurse
was
saying
something
*NL*
in
a
whisper
to
his
mother
,
and
that
in
his
mother
's
face
there
was
a
*NL*
look
of
dread
and
something
like
shame
,
which
was
so
strangely
*NL*
unbecoming
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sweet
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
say
_
good-bye
_
,
but
the
expression
on
her
face
said
it
,
*NL*
and
he
understood
.
``
Darling
,
darling
Kootik
!
''
she
used
the
name
by
which
*NL*
she
had
called
him
when
he
was
little
,
``
you
wo
n't
forget
me
?
You
...
''
but
*NL*
she
could
not
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
afterwards
she
thought
of
words
she
might
have
said
.
But
now
*NL*
she
did
not
know
how
to
say
it
,
and
could
say
nothing
.
But
Seryozha
knew
*NL*
all
she
wanted
to
say
to
him
.
He
understood
that
she
was
unhappy
and
*NL*
loved
him
.
He
understood
even
what
the
nurse
had
whispered
.
He
had
*NL*
caught
the
words
``
always
at
nine
o'clock
,
''
and
he
knew
that
this
was
*NL*
said
of
his
father
,
and
that
his
father
and
mother
could
not
meet
.
That
*NL*
he
understood
,
but
one
thing
he
could
not
understand
--
why
there
should
*NL*
be
a
look
of
dread
and
shame
in
her
face
?
...
She
was
not
in
fault
,
but
*NL*
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
ashamed
of
something
.
He
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
put
a
question
that
would
have
set
at
rest
this
doubt
,
but
he
did
not
*NL*
dare
;
he
saw
that
she
was
miserable
,
and
he
felt
for
her
.
Silently
he
*NL*
pressed
close
to
her
and
whispered
,
``
Do
n't
go
yet
.
He
wo
n't
come
just
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
held
him
away
from
her
to
see
what
he
was
thinking
,
what
to
*NL*
say
to
him
,
and
in
his
frightened
face
she
read
not
only
that
he
was
*NL*
speaking
of
his
father
,
but
,
as
it
were
,
asking
her
what
he
ought
to
*NL*
think
about
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seryozha
,
my
darling
,
''
she
said
,
``
love
him
;
he
's
better
and
kinder
than
*NL*
I
am
,
and
I
have
done
him
wrong
.
When
you
grow
up
you
will
judge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
better
than
you
!
...
''
he
cried
in
despair
through
his
*NL*
tears
,
and
,
clutching
her
by
the
shoulders
,
he
began
squeezing
her
with
*NL*
all
his
force
to
him
,
his
arms
trembling
with
the
strain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sweet
,
my
little
one
!
''
said
Anna
,
and
she
cried
as
weakly
and
*NL*
childishly
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
door
opened
.
Vassily
Lukitch
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
other
door
there
was
the
sound
of
steps
,
and
the
nurse
in
a
*NL*
scared
whisper
said
,
``
He
's
coming
,
''
and
gave
Anna
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seryozha
sank
onto
the
bed
and
sobbed
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
Anna
removed
his
hands
,
once
more
kissed
his
wet
face
,
and
with
rapid
*NL*
steps
went
to
the
door
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
walked
in
,
meeting
her
.
*NL*
Seeing
her
,
he
stopped
short
and
bowed
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
had
just
said
he
was
better
and
kinder
than
she
,
in
the
*NL*
rapid
glance
she
flung
at
him
,
taking
in
his
whole
figure
in
all
its
*NL*
details
,
feelings
of
repulsion
and
hatred
for
him
and
jealousy
over
her
*NL*
son
took
possession
of
her
.
With
a
swift
gesture
she
put
down
her
veil
,
*NL*
and
,
quickening
her
pace
,
almost
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
time
to
undo
,
and
so
carried
back
with
her
,
the
parcel
of
*NL*
toys
she
had
chosen
the
day
before
in
a
toy
shop
with
such
love
and
*NL*
sorrow
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
intensely
as
Anna
had
longed
to
see
her
son
,
and
long
as
she
had
been
*NL*
thinking
of
it
and
preparing
herself
for
it
,
she
had
not
in
the
least
*NL*
expected
that
seeing
him
would
affect
her
so
deeply
.
On
getting
back
to
*NL*
her
lonely
rooms
in
the
hotel
she
could
not
for
a
long
while
understand
*NL*
why
she
was
there
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
over
,
and
I
am
again
alone
,
''
she
said
*NL*
to
herself
,
and
without
taking
off
her
hat
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
*NL*
by
the
hearth
.
Fixing
her
eyes
on
a
bronze
clock
standing
on
a
table
*NL*
between
the
windows
,
she
tried
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
maid
brought
from
abroad
came
in
to
suggest
she
should
dress
.
*NL*
She
gazed
at
her
wonderingly
and
said
,
``
Presently
.
''
A
footman
offered
*NL*
her
coffee
.
``
Later
on
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Italian
nurse
,
after
having
taken
the
baby
out
in
her
best
,
came
in
*NL*
with
her
,
and
brought
her
to
Anna
.
The
plump
,
well-fed
little
baby
,
on
*NL*
seeing
her
mother
,
as
she
always
did
,
held
out
her
fat
little
hands
,
and
*NL*
with
a
smile
on
her
toothless
mouth
,
began
,
like
a
fish
with
a
float
,
*NL*
bobbing
her
fingers
up
and
down
the
starched
folds
of
her
embroidered
*NL*
skirt
,
making
them
rustle
.
It
was
impossible
not
to
smile
,
not
to
kiss
*NL*
the
baby
,
impossible
not
to
hold
out
a
finger
for
her
to
clutch
,
crowing
*NL*
and
prancing
all
over
;
impossible
not
to
offer
her
a
lip
which
she
*NL*
sucked
into
her
little
mouth
by
way
of
a
kiss
.
And
all
this
Anna
did
,
*NL*
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
made
her
dance
,
and
kissed
her
fresh
little
*NL*
cheek
and
bare
little
elbows
;
but
at
the
sight
of
this
child
it
was
*NL*
plainer
than
ever
to
her
that
the
feeling
she
had
for
her
could
not
be
*NL*
called
love
in
comparison
with
what
she
felt
for
Seryozha
.
Everything
in
*NL*
this
baby
was
charming
,
but
for
some
reason
all
this
did
not
go
deep
to
*NL*
her
heart
.
On
her
first
child
,
though
the
child
of
an
unloved
father
,
*NL*
had
been
concentrated
all
the
love
that
had
never
found
satisfaction
.
*NL*
Her
baby
girl
had
been
born
in
the
most
painful
circumstances
and
had
*NL*
not
had
a
hundredth
part
of
the
care
and
thought
which
had
been
*NL*
concentrated
on
her
first
child
.
Besides
,
in
the
little
girl
everything
*NL*
was
still
in
the
future
,
while
Seryozha
was
by
now
almost
a
personality
,
*NL*
and
a
personality
dearly
loved
.
In
him
there
was
a
conflict
of
thought
*NL*
and
feeling
;
he
understood
her
,
he
loved
her
,
he
judged
her
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
recalling
his
words
and
his
eyes
.
And
she
was
forever
--
not
*NL*
physically
only
but
spiritually
--
divided
from
him
,
and
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
set
this
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
the
baby
back
to
the
nurse
,
let
her
go
,
and
opened
the
locket
*NL*
in
which
there
was
Seryozha
's
portrait
when
he
was
almost
of
the
same
*NL*
age
as
the
girl
.
She
got
up
,
and
,
taking
off
her
hat
,
took
up
from
a
*NL*
little
table
an
album
in
which
there
were
photographs
of
her
son
at
*NL*
different
ages
.
She
wanted
to
compare
them
,
and
began
taking
them
out
of
*NL*
the
album
.
She
took
them
all
out
except
one
,
the
latest
and
best
*NL*
photograph
.
In
it
he
was
in
a
white
smock
,
sitting
astride
a
chair
,
with
*NL*
frowning
eyes
and
smiling
lips
.
It
was
his
best
,
most
characteristic
*NL*
expression
.
With
her
little
supple
hands
,
her
white
,
delicate
fingers
,
*NL*
that
moved
with
a
peculiar
intensity
today
,
she
pulled
at
a
corner
of
*NL*
the
photograph
,
but
the
photograph
had
caught
somewhere
,
and
she
could
*NL*
not
get
it
out
.
There
was
no
paper
knife
on
the
table
,
and
so
,
pulling
*NL*
out
the
photograph
that
was
next
to
her
son
's
-LRB-
it
was
a
photograph
of
*NL*
Vronsky
taken
at
Rome
in
a
round
hat
and
with
long
hair
-RRB-
,
she
used
it
to
*NL*
push
out
her
son
's
photograph
.
``
Oh
,
here
is
he
!
''
she
said
,
glancing
at
*NL*
the
portrait
of
Vronsky
,
and
she
suddenly
recalled
that
he
was
the
cause
*NL*
of
her
present
misery
.
She
had
not
once
thought
of
him
all
the
morning
.
*NL*
But
now
,
coming
all
at
once
upon
that
manly
,
noble
face
,
so
familiar
and
*NL*
so
dear
to
her
,
she
felt
a
sudden
rush
of
love
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
is
he
?
How
is
it
he
leaves
me
alone
in
my
misery
?
''
she
*NL*
thought
all
at
once
with
a
feeling
of
reproach
,
forgetting
she
had
*NL*
herself
kept
from
him
everything
concerning
her
son
.
She
sent
to
ask
him
*NL*
to
come
to
her
immediately
;
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
awaited
him
,
*NL*
rehearsing
to
herself
the
words
in
which
she
would
tell
him
all
,
and
the
*NL*
expressions
of
love
with
which
he
would
console
her
.
The
messenger
*NL*
returned
with
the
answer
that
he
had
a
visitor
with
him
,
but
that
he
*NL*
would
come
immediately
,
and
that
he
asked
whether
she
would
let
him
*NL*
bring
with
him
Prince
Yashvin
,
who
had
just
arrived
in
Petersburg
.
``
He
's
*NL*
not
coming
alone
,
and
since
dinner
yesterday
he
has
not
seen
me
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
;
``
he
's
not
coming
so
that
I
could
tell
him
everything
,
but
*NL*
coming
with
Yashvin
.
''
And
all
at
once
a
strange
idea
came
to
her
:
what
*NL*
if
he
had
ceased
to
love
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
going
over
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
she
saw
in
everything
a
confirmation
of
this
terrible
idea
.
The
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
not
dined
at
home
yesterday
,
and
the
fact
that
he
had
*NL*
insisted
on
their
taking
separate
sets
of
rooms
in
Petersburg
,
and
that
*NL*
even
now
he
was
not
coming
to
her
alone
,
as
though
he
were
trying
to
*NL*
avoid
meeting
her
face
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
ought
to
tell
me
so
.
I
must
know
that
it
is
so
.
If
I
knew
it
,
*NL*
then
I
know
what
I
should
do
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
utterly
unable
to
*NL*
picture
to
herself
the
position
she
would
be
in
if
she
were
convinced
of
*NL*
his
not
caring
for
her
.
She
thought
he
had
ceased
to
love
her
,
she
felt
*NL*
close
upon
despair
,
and
consequently
she
felt
exceptionally
alert
.
She
*NL*
rang
for
her
maid
and
went
to
her
dressing
room
.
As
she
dressed
,
she
*NL*
took
more
care
over
her
appearance
than
she
had
done
all
those
days
,
as
*NL*
though
he
might
,
if
he
had
grown
cold
to
her
,
fall
in
love
with
her
*NL*
again
because
she
had
dressed
and
arranged
her
hair
in
the
way
most
*NL*
becoming
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
the
bell
ring
before
she
was
ready
.
When
she
went
into
the
*NL*
drawing
room
it
was
not
he
,
but
Yashvin
,
who
met
her
eyes
.
Vronsky
was
*NL*
looking
through
the
photographs
of
her
son
,
which
she
had
forgotten
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
he
made
no
haste
to
look
round
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
met
already
,
''
she
said
,
putting
her
little
hand
into
the
huge
*NL*
hand
of
Yashvin
,
whose
bashfulness
was
so
queerly
out
of
keeping
with
*NL*
his
immense
frame
and
coarse
face
.
``
We
met
last
year
at
the
races
.
Give
*NL*
them
to
me
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
rapid
movement
snatching
from
Vronsky
the
*NL*
photographs
of
her
son
,
and
glancing
significantly
at
him
with
flashing
*NL*
eyes
.
``
Were
the
races
good
this
year
?
Instead
of
them
I
saw
the
races
in
*NL*
the
Corso
in
Rome
.
But
you
do
n't
care
for
life
abroad
,
''
she
said
with
a
*NL*
cordial
smile
.
``
I
know
you
and
all
your
tastes
,
though
I
have
seen
so
*NL*
little
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awfully
sorry
for
that
,
for
my
tastes
are
mostly
bad
,
''
said
*NL*
Yashvin
,
gnawing
at
his
left
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
talked
a
little
while
,
and
noticing
that
Vronsky
glanced
at
the
*NL*
clock
,
Yashvin
asked
her
whether
she
would
be
staying
much
longer
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
unbending
his
huge
figure
reached
after
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
long
,
I
think
,
''
she
said
hesitatingly
,
glancing
at
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
then
we
sha
n't
meet
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
dine
with
me
,
''
said
Anna
resolutely
,
angry
it
seemed
with
*NL*
herself
for
her
embarrassment
,
but
flushing
as
she
always
did
when
she
*NL*
defined
her
position
before
a
fresh
person
.
``
The
dinner
here
is
not
*NL*
good
,
but
at
least
you
will
see
him
.
There
is
no
one
of
his
old
friends
*NL*
in
the
regiment
Alexey
cares
for
as
he
does
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
,
''
said
Yashvin
with
a
smile
,
from
which
Vronsky
could
see
*NL*
that
he
liked
Anna
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yashvin
said
good-bye
and
went
away
;
Vronsky
stayed
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
too
?
''
she
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
late
already
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Run
along
!
I
'll
catch
you
up
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
''
he
called
to
Yashvin
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
without
taking
her
eyes
off
him
,
gazed
at
*NL*
him
while
she
ransacked
her
mind
for
the
words
to
say
that
would
keep
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
there
's
something
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
''
and
taking
his
*NL*
broad
hand
she
pressed
it
on
her
neck
.
``
Oh
,
was
it
right
my
asking
him
*NL*
to
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
quite
right
,
''
he
said
with
a
serene
smile
that
showed
his
even
*NL*
teeth
,
and
he
kissed
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
,
you
have
not
changed
to
me
?
''
she
said
,
pressing
his
hand
in
*NL*
both
of
hers
.
``
Alexey
,
I
am
miserable
here
.
When
are
we
going
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
,
soon
.
You
would
n't
believe
how
disagreeable
our
way
of
living
*NL*
here
is
to
me
too
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
drew
away
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
,
go
!
''
she
said
in
a
tone
of
offense
,
and
she
walked
quickly
*NL*
away
from
him
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Vronsky
returned
home
,
Anna
was
not
yet
home
.
Soon
after
he
had
*NL*
left
,
some
lady
,
so
they
told
him
,
had
come
to
see
her
,
and
she
had
gone
*NL*
out
with
her
.
That
she
had
gone
out
without
leaving
word
where
she
was
*NL*
going
,
that
she
had
not
yet
come
back
,
and
that
all
the
morning
she
had
*NL*
been
going
about
somewhere
without
a
word
to
him
--
all
this
,
together
*NL*
with
the
strange
look
of
excitement
in
her
face
in
the
morning
,
and
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
hostile
tone
with
which
she
had
before
Yashvin
*NL*
almost
snatched
her
son
's
photographs
out
of
his
hands
,
made
him
*NL*
serious
.
He
decided
he
absolutely
must
speak
openly
with
her
.
And
he
*NL*
waited
for
her
in
her
drawing
room
.
But
Anna
did
not
return
alone
,
but
*NL*
brought
with
her
her
old
unmarried
aunt
,
Princess
Oblonskaya
.
This
was
*NL*
the
lady
who
had
come
in
the
morning
,
and
with
whom
Anna
had
gone
out
*NL*
shopping
.
Anna
appeared
not
to
notice
Vronsky
's
worried
and
inquiring
*NL*
expression
,
and
began
a
lively
account
of
her
morning
's
shopping
.
He
saw
*NL*
that
there
was
something
working
within
her
;
in
her
flashing
eyes
,
when
*NL*
they
rested
for
a
moment
on
him
,
there
was
an
intense
concentration
,
and
*NL*
in
her
words
and
movements
there
was
that
nervous
rapidity
and
grace
*NL*
which
,
during
the
early
period
of
their
intimacy
,
had
so
fascinated
him
,
*NL*
but
which
now
so
disturbed
and
alarmed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
laid
for
four
.
All
were
gathered
together
and
about
to
go
*NL*
into
the
little
dining
room
when
Tushkevitch
made
his
appearance
with
a
*NL*
message
from
Princess
Betsy
.
Princess
Betsy
begged
her
to
excuse
her
not
*NL*
having
come
to
say
good-bye
;
she
had
been
indisposed
,
but
begged
Anna
to
*NL*
come
to
her
between
half-past
six
and
nine
o'clock
.
Vronsky
glanced
at
*NL*
Anna
at
the
precise
limit
of
time
,
so
suggestive
of
steps
having
been
*NL*
taken
that
she
should
meet
no
one
;
but
Anna
appeared
not
to
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
sorry
that
I
ca
n't
come
just
between
half-past
six
and
nine
,
''
she
*NL*
said
with
a
faint
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
princess
will
be
very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
am
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
going
,
no
doubt
,
to
hear
Patti
?
''
said
Tushkevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patti
?
You
suggest
the
idea
to
me
.
I
would
go
if
it
were
possible
to
*NL*
get
a
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
get
one
,
''
Tushkevitch
offered
his
services
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
,
very
grateful
to
you
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
But
wo
n't
you
dine
*NL*
with
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
gave
a
hardly
perceptible
shrug
.
He
was
at
a
complete
loss
to
*NL*
understand
what
Anna
was
about
.
What
had
she
brought
the
old
Princess
*NL*
Oblonskaya
home
for
,
what
had
she
made
Tushkevitch
stay
to
dinner
for
,
*NL*
and
,
most
amazing
of
all
,
why
was
she
sending
him
for
a
box
?
Could
she
*NL*
possibly
think
in
her
position
of
going
to
Patti
's
benefit
,
where
all
*NL*
the
circle
of
her
acquaintances
would
be
?
He
looked
at
her
with
serious
*NL*
eyes
,
but
she
responded
with
that
defiant
,
half-mirthful
,
half-desperate
*NL*
look
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
.
At
dinner
Anna
was
*NL*
in
aggressively
high
spirits
--
she
almost
flirted
both
with
Tushkevitch
*NL*
and
with
Yashvin
.
When
they
got
up
from
dinner
and
Tushkevitch
had
gone
*NL*
to
get
a
box
at
the
opera
,
Yashvin
went
to
smoke
,
and
Vronsky
went
down
*NL*
with
him
to
his
own
rooms
.
After
sitting
there
for
some
time
he
ran
*NL*
upstairs
.
Anna
was
already
dressed
in
a
low-necked
gown
of
light
silk
*NL*
and
velvet
that
she
had
had
made
in
Paris
,
and
with
costly
white
lace
on
*NL*
her
head
,
framing
her
face
,
and
particularly
becoming
,
showing
up
her
*NL*
dazzling
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
really
going
to
the
theater
?
''
he
said
,
trying
not
to
look
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
ask
with
such
alarm
?
''
she
said
,
wounded
again
at
his
not
*NL*
looking
at
her
.
``
Why
should
n't
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
not
to
understand
the
motive
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
,
there
's
no
reason
whatever
,
''
he
said
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
say
,
''
she
said
,
willfully
refusing
to
see
the
irony
*NL*
of
his
tone
,
and
quietly
turning
back
her
long
,
perfumed
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
for
God
's
sake
!
what
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
he
said
,
appealing
*NL*
to
her
exactly
as
once
her
husband
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
are
asking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
it
's
out
of
the
question
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
I
'm
not
going
alone
.
Princess
Varvara
has
gone
to
dress
,
she
is
*NL*
going
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
an
air
of
perplexity
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
know
?
...
''
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
care
to
know
!
''
she
almost
shrieked
.
``
I
do
n't
care
to
.
Do
I
*NL*
regret
what
I
have
done
?
No
,
no
,
no
!
If
it
were
all
to
do
again
from
the
*NL*
beginning
,
it
would
be
the
same
.
For
us
,
for
you
and
for
me
,
there
is
*NL*
only
one
thing
that
matters
,
whether
we
love
each
other
.
Other
people
we
*NL*
need
not
consider
.
Why
are
we
living
here
apart
and
not
seeing
each
*NL*
other
?
Why
ca
n't
I
go
?
I
love
you
,
and
I
do
n't
care
for
anything
,
''
she
*NL*
said
in
Russian
,
glancing
at
him
with
a
peculiar
gleam
in
her
eyes
that
*NL*
he
could
not
understand
.
``
If
you
have
not
changed
to
me
,
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
look
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
.
He
saw
all
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
full
dress
,
*NL*
always
so
becoming
to
her
.
But
now
her
beauty
and
elegance
were
just
*NL*
what
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
feeling
can
not
change
,
you
know
,
but
I
beg
you
,
I
entreat
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
again
in
French
,
with
a
note
of
tender
supplication
in
his
voice
,
*NL*
but
with
coldness
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
his
words
,
but
she
saw
the
coldness
of
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
answered
with
irritation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
beg
you
to
explain
why
I
should
not
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
might
cause
you
...
''
he
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
.
Yashvin
_

and
Princess
*NL*
Varvara
is
no
worse
than
others

Oh

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
for
the
first
time
experienced
a
feeling
of
anger
against
Anna
,
*NL*
almost
a
hatred
for
her
willfully
refusing
to
understand
her
own
*NL*
position
.
This
feeling
was
aggravated
by
his
being
unable
to
tell
her
*NL*
plainly
the
cause
of
his
anger
.
If
he
had
told
her
directly
what
he
was
*NL*
thinking
,
he
would
have
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
dress
,
with
a
princess
only
too
well
known
to
everyone
,
to
show
*NL*
yourself
at
the
theater
is
equivalent
not
merely
to
acknowledging
your
*NL*
position
as
a
fallen
woman
,
but
is
flinging
down
a
challenge
to
society
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
cutting
yourself
off
from
it
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
say
that
to
her
.
``
But
how
can
she
fail
to
see
it
,
and
what
*NL*
is
going
on
in
her
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
felt
at
the
same
time
that
*NL*
his
respect
for
her
was
diminished
while
his
sense
of
her
beauty
was
*NL*
intensified
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
scowling
to
his
rooms
,
and
sitting
down
beside
Yashvin
,
*NL*
who
,
with
his
long
legs
stretched
out
on
a
chair
,
was
drinking
brandy
*NL*
and
seltzer
water
,
he
ordered
a
glass
of
the
same
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
talking
of
Lankovsky
's
Powerful
.
That
's
a
fine
horse
,
and
I
*NL*
would
advise
you
to
buy
him
,
''
said
Yashvin
,
glancing
at
his
comrade
's
*NL*
gloomy
face
.
``
His
hind-quarters
are
n't
quite
first-rate
,
but
the
legs
*NL*
and
head
--
one
could
n't
wish
for
anything
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
will
take
him
,
''
answered
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
about
horses
interested
him
,
but
he
did
not
for
an
*NL*
instant
forget
Anna
,
and
could
not
help
listening
to
the
sound
of
steps
*NL*
in
the
corridor
and
looking
at
the
clock
on
the
chimney
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
Arkadyevna
gave
orders
to
announce
that
she
has
gone
to
the
*NL*
theater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yashvin
,
tipping
another
glass
of
brandy
into
the
bubbling
water
,
drank
*NL*
it
and
got
up
,
buttoning
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
go
,
''
he
said
,
faintly
smiling
under
his
mustache
,
and
*NL*
showing
by
this
smile
that
he
knew
the
cause
of
Vronsky
's
gloominess
,
*NL*
and
did
not
attach
any
significance
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
,
''
Vronsky
answered
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
,
I
promised
to
.
Good-bye
,
then
.
If
you
do
,
come
to
the
*NL*
stalls
;
you
can
take
Kruzin
's
stall
,
''
added
Yashvin
as
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
wife
is
a
care
,
but
it
's
worse
when
she
's
not
a
wife
,
''
thought
*NL*
Yashvin
,
as
he
walked
out
of
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
left
alone
,
got
up
from
his
chair
and
began
pacing
up
and
down
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
today
?
The
fourth
night
...
Yegor
and
his
wife
are
there
,
*NL*
and
my
mother
,
most
likely
.
Of
course
all
Petersburg
's
there
.
Now
she
's
*NL*
gone
in
,
taken
off
her
cloak
and
come
into
the
light
.
Tushkevitch
,
*NL*
Yashvin
,
Princess
Varvara
,
''
he
pictured
them
to
himself
...
``
What
about
*NL*
me
?
Either
that
I
'm
frightened
or
have
given
up
to
Tushkevitch
the
right
*NL*
to
protect
her
?
From
every
point
of
view
--
stupid
,
stupid
!
...
And
why
is
*NL*
she
putting
me
in
such
a
position
?
''
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
gesture
he
knocked
against
the
table
,
on
which
there
was
*NL*
standing
the
seltzer
water
and
the
decanter
of
brandy
,
and
almost
upset
*NL*
it
.
He
tried
to
catch
it
,
let
it
slip
,
and
angrily
kicked
the
table
over
*NL*
and
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
care
to
be
in
my
service
,
''
he
said
to
the
valet
who
came
in
,
*NL*
``
you
had
better
remember
your
duties
.
This
should
n't
be
here
.
You
ought
*NL*
to
have
cleared
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
valet
,
conscious
of
his
own
innocence
,
would
have
defended
himself
,
*NL*
but
glancing
at
his
master
,
he
saw
from
his
face
that
the
only
thing
to
*NL*
do
was
to
be
silent
,
and
hurriedly
threading
his
way
in
and
out
,
dropped
*NL*
down
on
the
carpet
and
began
gathering
up
the
whole
and
broken
glasses
*NL*
and
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
your
duty
;
send
the
waiter
to
clear
away
,
and
get
my
dress
*NL*
coat
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
went
into
the
theater
at
half-past
eight
.
The
performance
was
in
*NL*
full
swing
.
The
little
old
box-keeper
,
recognizing
Vronsky
as
he
helped
*NL*
him
off
with
his
fur
coat
,
called
him
``
Your
Excellency
,
''
and
suggested
*NL*
he
should
not
take
a
number
but
should
simply
call
Fyodor
.
In
the
*NL*
brightly
lighted
corridor
there
was
no
one
but
the
box-opener
and
two
*NL*
attendants
with
fur
cloaks
on
their
arms
listening
at
the
doors
.
Through
*NL*
the
closed
doors
came
the
sounds
of
the
discreet
_
staccato
_
*NL*
accompaniment
of
the
orchestra
,
and
a
single
female
voice
rendering
*NL*
distinctly
a
musical
phrase
.
The
door
opened
to
let
the
box-opener
slip
*NL*
through
,
and
the
phrase
drawing
to
the
end
reached
Vronsky
's
hearing
*NL*
clearly
.
But
the
doors
were
closed
again
at
once
,
and
Vronsky
did
not
*NL*
hear
the
end
of
the
phrase
and
the
cadence
of
the
accompaniment
,
though
*NL*
he
knew
from
the
thunder
of
applause
that
it
was
over
.
When
he
entered
*NL*
the
hall
,
brilliantly
lighted
with
chandeliers
and
gas
jets
,
the
noise
*NL*
was
still
going
on
.
On
the
stage
the
singer
,
bowing
and
smiling
,
with
*NL*
bare
shoulders
flashing
with
diamonds
,
was
,
with
the
help
of
the
tenor
*NL*
who
had
given
her
his
arm
,
gathering
up
the
bouquets
that
were
flying
*NL*
awkwardly
over
the
footlights
.
Then
she
went
up
to
a
gentleman
with
*NL*
glossy
pomaded
hair
parted
down
the
center
,
who
was
stretching
across
*NL*
the
footlights
holding
out
something
to
her
,
and
all
the
public
in
the
*NL*
stalls
as
well
as
in
the
boxes
was
in
excitement
,
craning
forward
,
*NL*
shouting
and
clapping
.
The
conductor
in
his
high
chair
assisted
in
*NL*
passing
the
offering
,
and
straightened
his
white
tie
.
Vronsky
walked
*NL*
into
the
middle
of
the
stalls
,
and
,
standing
still
,
began
looking
about
*NL*
him
.
That
day
less
than
ever
was
his
attention
turned
upon
the
familiar
,
*NL*
habitual
surroundings
,
the
stage
,
the
noise
,
all
the
familiar
,
*NL*
uninteresting
,
particolored
herd
of
spectators
in
the
packed
theater
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
,
as
always
,
the
same
ladies
of
some
sort
with
officers
of
*NL*
some
sort
in
the
back
of
the
boxes
;
the
same
gaily
dressed
women
--
God
*NL*
knows
who
--
and
uniforms
and
black
coats
;
the
same
dirty
crowd
in
the
*NL*
upper
gallery
;
and
among
the
crowd
,
in
the
boxes
and
in
the
front
rows
,
*NL*
were
some
forty
of
the
_
real
_
people
.
And
to
those
oases
Vronsky
at
once
*NL*
directed
his
attention
,
and
with
them
he
entered
at
once
into
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
act
was
over
when
he
went
in
,
and
so
he
did
not
go
straight
to
his
*NL*
brother
's
box
,
but
going
up
to
the
first
row
of
stalls
stopped
at
the
*NL*
footlights
with
Serpuhovskoy
,
who
,
standing
with
one
knee
raised
and
his
*NL*
heel
on
the
footlights
,
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
distance
and
beckoned
*NL*
to
him
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
not
yet
seen
Anna
.
He
purposely
avoided
looking
in
her
*NL*
direction
.
But
he
knew
by
the
direction
of
people
's
eyes
where
she
was
.
*NL*
He
looked
round
discreetly
,
but
he
was
not
seeking
her
;
expecting
the
*NL*
worst
,
his
eyes
sought
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
To
his
relief
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
not
in
the
theater
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
little
of
the
military
man
there
is
left
in
you
!
''
Serpuhovskoy
was
*NL*
saying
to
him
.
``
A
diplomat
,
an
artist
,
something
of
that
sort
,
one
would
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
was
like
going
back
home
when
I
put
on
a
black
coat
,
''
answered
*NL*
Vronsky
,
smiling
and
slowly
taking
out
his
opera
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
own
I
envy
you
there
.
When
I
come
back
from
abroad
and
put
*NL*
on
this
,
''
he
touched
his
epaulets
,
``
I
regret
my
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Serpuhovskoy
had
long
given
up
all
hope
of
Vronsky
's
career
,
but
he
*NL*
liked
him
as
before
,
and
was
now
particularly
cordial
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
you
were
not
in
time
for
the
first
act
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
listening
with
one
ear
,
moved
his
opera
glass
from
the
stalls
*NL*
and
scanned
the
boxes
.
Near
a
lady
in
a
turban
and
a
bald
old
man
,
who
*NL*
seemed
to
wave
angrily
in
the
moving
opera
glass
,
Vronsky
suddenly
*NL*
caught
sight
of
Anna
's
head
,
proud
,
strikingly
beautiful
,
and
smiling
in
*NL*
the
frame
of
lace
.
She
was
in
the
fifth
box
,
twenty
paces
from
him
.
She
*NL*
was
sitting
in
front
,
and
slightly
turning
,
was
saying
something
to
*NL*
Yashvin
.
The
setting
of
her
head
on
her
handsome
,
broad
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
the
restrained
excitement
and
brilliance
of
her
eyes
and
her
whole
face
*NL*
reminded
him
of
her
just
as
he
had
seen
her
at
the
ball
in
Moscow
.
But
*NL*
he
felt
utterly
different
towards
her
beauty
now
.
In
his
feeling
for
her
*NL*
now
there
was
no
element
of
mystery
,
and
so
her
beauty
,
though
it
*NL*
attracted
him
even
more
intensely
than
before
,
gave
him
now
a
sense
of
*NL*
injury
.
She
was
not
looking
in
his
direction
,
but
Vronsky
felt
that
she
*NL*
had
seen
him
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Vronsky
turned
the
opera
glass
again
in
that
direction
,
he
noticed
*NL*
that
Princess
Varvara
was
particularly
red
,
and
kept
laughing
*NL*
unnaturally
and
looking
round
at
the
next
box
.
Anna
,
folding
her
fan
and
*NL*
tapping
it
on
the
red
velvet
,
was
gazing
away
and
did
not
see
,
and
*NL*
obviously
did
not
wish
to
see
,
what
was
taking
place
in
the
next
box
.
*NL*
Yashvin
's
face
wore
the
expression
which
was
common
when
he
was
losing
*NL*
at
cards
.
Scowling
,
he
sucked
the
left
end
of
his
mustache
further
and
*NL*
further
into
his
mouth
,
and
cast
sidelong
glances
at
the
next
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
box
on
the
left
were
the
Kartasovs
.
Vronsky
knew
them
,
and
knew
*NL*
that
Anna
was
acquainted
with
them
.
Madame
Kartasova
,
a
thin
little
*NL*
woman
,
was
standing
up
in
her
box
,
and
,
her
back
turned
upon
Anna
,
she
*NL*
was
putting
on
a
mantle
that
her
husband
was
holding
for
her
.
Her
face
*NL*
was
pale
and
angry
,
and
she
was
talking
excitedly
.
Kartasov
,
a
fat
,
bald
*NL*
man
,
was
continually
looking
round
at
Anna
,
while
he
attempted
to
soothe
*NL*
his
wife
.
When
the
wife
had
gone
out
,
the
husband
lingered
a
long
while
,
*NL*
and
tried
to
catch
Anna
's
eye
,
obviously
anxious
to
bow
to
her
.
But
*NL*
Anna
,
with
unmistakable
intention
,
avoided
noticing
him
,
and
talked
to
*NL*
Yashvin
,
whose
cropped
head
was
bent
down
to
her
.
Kartasov
went
out
*NL*
without
making
his
salutation
,
and
the
box
was
left
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
could
not
understand
exactly
what
had
passed
between
the
*NL*
Kartasovs
and
Anna
,
but
he
saw
that
something
humiliating
for
Anna
had
*NL*
happened
.
He
knew
this
both
from
what
he
had
seen
,
and
most
of
all
from
*NL*
the
face
of
Anna
,
who
,
he
could
see
,
was
taxing
every
nerve
to
carry
*NL*
through
the
part
she
had
taken
up
.
And
in
maintaining
this
attitude
of
*NL*
external
composure
she
was
completely
successful
.
Anyone
who
did
not
*NL*
know
her
and
her
circle
,
who
had
not
heard
all
the
utterances
of
the
*NL*
women
expressive
of
commiseration
,
indignation
,
and
amazement
,
that
she
*NL*
should
show
herself
in
society
,
and
show
herself
so
conspicuously
with
*NL*
her
lace
and
her
beauty
,
would
have
admired
the
serenity
and
loveliness
*NL*
of
this
woman
without
a
suspicion
that
she
was
undergoing
the
sensations
*NL*
of
a
man
in
the
stocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
that
something
had
happened
,
but
not
knowing
precisely
what
,
*NL*
Vronsky
felt
a
thrill
of
agonizing
anxiety
,
and
hoping
to
find
out
*NL*
something
,
he
went
towards
his
brother
's
box
.
Purposely
choosing
the
way
*NL*
round
furthest
from
Anna
's
box
,
he
jostled
as
he
came
out
against
the
*NL*
colonel
of
his
old
regiment
talking
to
two
acquaintances
.
Vronsky
heard
*NL*
the
name
of
Madame
Karenina
,
and
noticed
how
the
colonel
hastened
to
*NL*
address
Vronsky
loudly
by
name
,
with
a
meaning
glance
at
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Vronsky
!
When
are
you
coming
to
the
regiment
?
We
ca
n't
let
you
off
*NL*
without
a
supper
.
You
're
one
of
the
old
set
,
''
said
the
colonel
of
his
*NL*
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stop
,
awfully
sorry
,
another
time
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
and
he
ran
*NL*
upstairs
towards
his
brother
's
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
countess
,
Vronsky
's
mother
,
with
her
steel-gray
curls
,
was
in
*NL*
his
brother
's
box
.
Varya
with
the
young
Princess
Sorokina
met
him
in
the
*NL*
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
Princess
Sorokina
with
her
mother
,
Varya
held
out
her
hand
*NL*
to
her
brother-in-law
,
and
began
immediately
to
speak
of
what
interested
*NL*
him
.
She
was
more
excited
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
mean
and
hateful
,
and
Madame
Kartasova
had
no
right
to
do
*NL*
it
.
Madame
Karenina
...
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
?
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
you
've
not
heard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
should
be
the
last
person
to
hear
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
a
more
spiteful
creature
than
that
Madame
Kartasova
!
''

what
did
she
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
told
me
...
She
has
insulted
Madame
Karenina

Her
husband
*NL*
began
talking
to
her
across
the
box
,
and
Madame
Kartasova
made
a
scene
.
*NL*
She
said
something
aloud

he

something
insulting

and
went

*NL*
*NL*
``
Count

said
the
young
Princess

peeping
out
of
the
door
of
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

sarcastically

You

*NL*
Her

saw
that
she

not

of
delight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

coldly

had
moved

``
Maman

I
have
asked

he

answered

scowling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

only
saying

saying

*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
made
no
reply
,
and
saying
a
few
words
to
Princess
Sorokina
,
he
*NL*
went
away
.
At
the
door
he
met
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Alexey
!
''
said
his
brother
.
``
How
disgusting
!
Idiot
of
a
woman
,
*NL*
nothing

I
wanted
to
go
straight
to
her
.
Let
's
go
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
did
not
hear
him
.
With
rapid
steps
he
went
downstairs
;
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
must
do
something
,
but
he
did
not
know
what
.
Anger
with
her
for
*NL*
having
put
herself
and
him
in
such
a
false
position
,
together
with
pity
*NL*
for
her
suffering
,
filled
his
heart
.
He
went
down
,
and
made
straight
for
*NL*
Anna
's
box
.
At
her
box
stood
Stremov
,
talking
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
more
tenors
.
_
Le

''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
bowed
to
her
and
stopped
to
greet
Stremov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
in
late
,
I
think
,
and
have
missed
the
best
song

''
Anna
said
to
*NL*
Vronsky
,
glancing
ironically
,
he
thought
,
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
poor
judge
of
music
,
''
he
said
,
looking
sternly
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
Prince
Yashvin
,
''
she
said
smiling
,
``
who
considers
that
Patti
sings
*NL*
too
loud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
,
her
little
hand
in
its
long
glove
taking
the
*NL*
playbill
Vronsky
picked
up
,
and
suddenly
at
that
instant
her
lovely
face
*NL*
quivered
.
She
got
up
and
went
into
the
interior
of
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
in
the
next
act
that
her
box
was
empty
,
Vronsky
,
rousing
*NL*
indignant
``
hushes
''
in
the
silent
audience
,
went
out
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
solo
and
drove
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
was
already
at
home
.
When
Vronsky
went
up
to
her
,
she
was
in
the
*NL*
same
dress
as
she
had
worn
at
the
theater
.
She
was
sitting
in
the
first
*NL*
armchair
against
the
wall
,
looking
straight
before
her
.
She
looked
at
*NL*
him
,
and
at
once
resumed
her
former
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
you
are
to
blame
for
everything
!
''
she
cried
,
with
tears
of
despair
*NL*
and
hatred
in
her
voice
,
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begged
,
I
implored
you
not
to
go
,
I
knew
it
would
be
unpleasant
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unpleasant
!
''
she
cried
--
``
hideous
!
As
long
as
I
live
I
shall
never
*NL*
forget
it
.
She
said
it
was
a
disgrace
to
sit
beside
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
silly
woman
's
chatter
,
''
he
said
:
``
but
why
risk
it
,
why
provoke
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
your
calm
.
You
ought
not
to
have
brought
me
to
this

If
you

...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
!
How
does
the
question
of
my
love
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
loved
me
,
as
I
love
,
if
you
were
tortured
as
I
am

''
she
*NL*
said
,
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sorry
for
her
,
and
angry
notwithstanding
.
He
assured
her
of
his
*NL*
love
because
he
saw
that
this
was
the
only
means
of
soothing
her
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
reproach
her
in
words
,
but
in
his
heart
he
reproached
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
asseverations
of
his
love
,
which
seemed
to
him
so
vulgar
that
he
*NL*
was
ashamed
to
utter
them
,
she
drank
in
eagerly
,
and
gradually
became
*NL*
calmer
.
The
next
day
,
completely
reconciled
,
they
left
for
the
country

*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
spent
the
summer
with
her
children
at
Pokrovskoe
,
at
*NL*
her
sister
Kitty
Levin
's
.
The
house
on
her
own
estate
was
quite
in
*NL*
ruins
,
and
Levin
and
his
wife
had
persuaded
her
to
spend
the
summer
with
*NL*
them
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
greatly
approved
of
the
arrangement
.
He
said
*NL*
he
was
very
sorry
his
official
duties
prevented
him
from
spending
the
*NL*
summer
in
the
country
with
his
family
,
which
would
have
been
the
*NL*
greatest
happiness
for
him
;
and
remaining
in
Moscow
,
he
came
down
to
the
*NL*
country
from
time
to
time
for
a
day
or
two
.
Besides
the
Oblonskys
,
with
*NL*
all
their
children
and
their
governess
,
the
old
princess
too
came
to
*NL*
stay
that
summer
with
the
Levins
,
as
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
watch
*NL*
over
her
inexperienced
daughter
in
her
_
interesting
condition
_
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
Varenka
,
Kitty
's
friend
abroad
,
kept
her
promise
to
come
to
*NL*
Kitty
when
she
was
married
,
and
stayed
with
her
friend
.
All
of
these
*NL*
were
friends
or
relations
of
Levin
's
wife
.
And
though
he
liked
them
all
,
*NL*
he
rather
regretted
his
own
Levin
world
and
ways
,
which
was
smothered
by
*NL*
this
influx
of
the
``
Shtcherbatsky
element
,
''
as
he
called
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
Of
his
own
relations
there
stayed
with
him
only
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
but
*NL*
he
too
was
a
man
of
the
Koznishev
and
not
the
Levin
stamp
,
so
that
the
*NL*
Levin
spirit
was
utterly
obliterated
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Levins
'
house
,
so
long
deserted
,
there
were
now
so
many
people
*NL*
that
almost
all
the
rooms
were
occupied
,
and
almost
every
day
it
*NL*
happened
that
the
old
princess
,
sitting
down
to
table
,
counted
them
all
*NL*
over
,
and
put
the
thirteenth
grandson
or
granddaughter
at
a
separate
*NL*
table
.
And
Kitty
,
with
her
careful
housekeeping
,
had
no
little
trouble
*NL*
to
get
all
the
chickens
,
turkeys
,
and
geese
,
of
which
so
many
were
*NL*
needed
to
satisfy
the
summer
appetites
of
the
visitors
and
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
family
were
sitting
at
dinner
.
Dolly
's
children
,
with
their
*NL*
governess
and
Varenka
,
were
making
plans
for
going
to
look
for
*NL*
mushrooms
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
was
looked
up
to
by
all
the
party
for
*NL*
his
intellect
and
learning
,
with
a
respect
that
almost
amounted
to
awe
,
*NL*
surprised
everyone
by
joining
in
the
conversation
about
mushrooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
with
you
.
I
am
very
fond
of
picking
mushrooms
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
looking
at
Varenka
;
``
I
think
it
's
a
very
nice
occupation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
shall
be
delighted
,
''
answered
Varenka
,
coloring
a
little
.
Kitty
*NL*
exchanged
meaningful
glances
with
Dolly
.
The
proposal
of
the
learned
and
*NL*
intellectual
Sergey
Ivanovitch
to
go
looking
for
mushrooms
with
Varenka
*NL*
confirmed
certain
theories
of
Kitty
's
with
which
her
mind
had
been
very
*NL*
busy
of
late
.
She
made
haste
to
address
some
remark
to
her
mother
,
so
*NL*
that
her
look
should
not
be
noticed
.
After
dinner
Sergey
Ivanovitch
sat
*NL*
with
his
cup
of
coffee
at
the
drawing-room
window
,
and
while
he
took
*NL*
part
in
a
conversation
he
had
begun
with
his
brother
,
he
watched
the
*NL*
door
through
which
the
children
would
start
on
the
mushroom-picking
*NL*
expedition
.
Levin
was
sitting
in
the
window
near
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
stood
beside
her
husband
,
evidently
awaiting
the
end
of
a
*NL*
conversation
that
had
no
interest
for
her
,
in
order
to
tell
him
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
changed
in
many
respects
since
your
marriage
,
and
for
the
*NL*
better
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
smiling
to
Kitty
,
and
obviously
little
*NL*
interested
in
the
conversation
,
``
but
you
have
remained
true
to
your
*NL*
passion
for
defending
the
most
paradoxical
theories
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katya
,
it
's
not
good
for
you
to
stand
,
''
her
husband
said
to
her
,
*NL*
putting
a
chair
for
her
and
looking
significantly
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
and
there
's
no
time
either
,
''
added
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
seeing
the
*NL*
children
running
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
head
of
them
all
Tanya
galloped
sideways
,
in
her
tightly-drawn
*NL*
stockings
,
and
waving
a
basket
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
hat
,
she
ran
*NL*
straight
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldly
running
up
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
with
shining
eyes
,
so
like
her
*NL*
father
's
fine
eyes
,
she
handed
him
his
hat
and
made
as
though
she
would
*NL*
put
it
on
for
him
,
softening
her
freedom
by
a
shy
and
friendly
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varenka
's
waiting
,
''
she
said
,
carefully
putting
his
hat
on
,
seeing
from
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
smile
that
she
might
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
was
standing
at
the
door
,
dressed
in
a
yellow
print
gown
,
with
a
*NL*
white
kerchief
on
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
coming
,
I
'm
coming
,
Varvara
Andreevna
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
*NL*
finishing
his
cup
of
coffee
,
and
putting
into
their
separate
pockets
his
*NL*
handkerchief
and
cigar-case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
sweet
my
Varenka
is
!
eh
?
''
said
Kitty
to
her
husband
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
rose
.
She
spoke
so
that
Sergey
Ivanovitch
could
hear
,
*NL*
and
it
was
clear
that
she
meant
him
to
do
so
.
``
And
how
good-looking
she
*NL*
is
--
such
a
refined
beauty
!
Varenka
!
''
Kitty
shouted
.
``
Shall
you
be
in
the
*NL*
mill
copse
?
We
'll
come
out
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
forget
your
condition
,
Kitty
,
''
said
the
old
princess
,
*NL*
hurriedly
coming
out
at
the
door
.
``
You
must
n't
shout
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
,
hearing
Kitty
's
voice
and
her
mother
's
reprimand
,
went
with
*NL*
light
,
rapid
steps
up
to
Kitty
.
The
rapidity
of
her
movement
,
her
*NL*
flushed
and
eager
face
,
everything
betrayed
that
something
out
of
the
*NL*
common
was
going
on
in
her
.
Kitty
knew
what
this
was
,
and
had
been
*NL*
watching
her
intently
.
She
called
Varenka
at
that
moment
merely
in
order
*NL*
mentally
to
give
her
a
blessing
for
the
important
event
which
,
as
Kitty
*NL*
fancied
,
was
bound
to
come
to
pass
that
day
after
dinner
in
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Varenka
,
I
should
be
very
happy
if
a
certain
something
were
to
happen
,
''
*NL*
she
whispered
as
she
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
coming
with
us
?
''
Varenka
said
to
Levin
in
confusion
,
*NL*
pretending
not
to
have
heard
what
had
been
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
coming
,
but
only
as
far
as
the
threshing-floor
,
and
there
I
shall
*NL*
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
do
you
want
there
?
''
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
to
have
a
look
at
the
new
wagons
,
and
to
check
the
invoice
,
''
*NL*
said
Levin
;
``
and
where
will
you
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
terrace
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
terrace
were
assembled
all
the
ladies
of
the
party
.
They
always
*NL*
liked
sitting
there
after
dinner
,
and
that
day
they
had
work
to
do
there
*NL*
too
.
Besides
the
sewing
and
knitting
of
baby
clothes
,
with
which
all
of
*NL*
them
were
busy
,
that
afternoon
jam
was
being
made
on
the
terrace
by
a
*NL*
method
new
to
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
without
the
addition
of
water
.
Kitty
had
*NL*
introduced
this
new
method
,
which
had
been
in
use
in
her
home
.
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
to
whom
the
task
of
jam-making
had
always
been
intrusted
,
*NL*
considering
that
what
had
been
done
in
the
Levin
household
could
not
be
*NL*
amiss
,
had
nevertheless
put
water
with
the
strawberries
,
maintaining
*NL*
that
the
jam
could
not
be
made
without
it
.
She
had
been
caught
in
the
*NL*
act
,
and
was
now
making
jam
before
everyone
,
and
it
was
to
be
proved
to
*NL*
her
conclusively
that
jam
could
be
very
well
made
without
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
her
face
heated
and
angry
,
her
hair
untidy
,
and
her
*NL*
thin
arms
bare
to
the
elbows
,
was
turning
the
preserving-pan
over
the
*NL*
charcoal
stove
,
looking
darkly
at
the
raspberries
and
devoutly
hoping
*NL*
they
would
stick
and
not
cook
properly
.
The
princess
,
conscious
that
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
wrath
must
be
chiefly
directed
against
her
,
as
the
*NL*
person
responsible
for
the
raspberry
jam-making
,
tried
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
absorbed
in
other
things
and
not
interested
in
the
jam
,
talked
of
other
*NL*
matters
,
but
cast
stealthy
glances
in
the
direction
of
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
buy
my
maids
'
dresses
myself
,
of
some
cheap
material
,
''
the
*NL*
princess
said
,
continuing
the
previous
conversation
.
``
Is
n't
it
time
to
*NL*
skim
it
,
my
dear
?
''
she
added
,
addressing
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
``
There
's
not
*NL*
the
slightest
need
for
you
to
do
it
,
and
it
's
hot
for
you
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
stopping
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
it
,
''
said
Dolly
,
and
getting
up
,
she
carefully
passed
the
spoon
*NL*
over
the
frothing
sugar
,
and
from
time
to
time
shook
off
the
clinging
*NL*
jam
from
the
spoon
by
knocking
it
on
a
plate
that
was
covered
with
*NL*
yellow-red
scum
and
blood-colored
syrup
.
``
How
they
'll
enjoy
this
at
*NL*
tea-time
!
''
she
thought
of
her
children
,
remembering
how
she
herself
as
a
*NL*
child
had
wondered
how
it
was
the
grown-up
people
did
not
eat
what
was
*NL*
best
of
all
--
the
scum
of
the
jam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
says
it
's
much
better
to
give
money
.
''
Dolly
took
up
meanwhile
the
*NL*
weighty
subject
under
discussion
,
what
presents
should
be
made
to
*NL*
servants
.
``
But
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
's
out
of
the
question
!
''
the
princess
and
Kitty
exclaimed
with
one
*NL*
voice
.
``
They
appreciate
a
present
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
last
year
,
for
instance
,
I
bought
our
Matrona
Semyenovna
,
not
a
*NL*
poplin
,
but
something
of
that
sort
,
''
said
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
she
was
wearing
it
on
your
nameday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
charming
pattern

so
simple
and
refined
,

I
should
have
liked
it
*NL*
myself
,
if
she
had
n't
had
it
.
Something
like
Varenka

.
So
pretty
and
*NL*
inexpensive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
I
think
it
's
done
,
''
said
Dolly
,
dropping
the
syrup
from
the
*NL*
spoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
it
sets
as
it
drops

it
's

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Agafea
Mihalovna
angrily
.
``
It
'll
be
just
the

*NL*
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
how
sweet
it
is
!
do
n't
frighten
it

Kitty
said
suddenly
,
looking
*NL*
at
a
sparrow
that
had
settled
on
the
step
and
was
pecking
at
the
center
*NL*
of
a
raspberry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
keep
a
little
further
from

said
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
A

said
Kitty
,
speaking
in
French
,
as
they
had
*NL*
been
doing
all
the
while
,
so
that
Agafea
Mihalovna
should
not
understand
*NL*
them
,
``
you
know

mamma

I
somehow
expect
things
to
be

How
splendid
it
would
be
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
a

matchmaker
she
is

Dolly

Kitty

crooking
one
of
her
fingers

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks

very
attractive

Dolly

*NL*
``

he
occupies

sort

barrier

all
at

broken
down

Dolly
,
smiling
*NL*
pensively
and
recalling
her
past
with
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma

how
did

Kitty

*NL*

There

nothing
out

the

her
face
beamed
all
over
at
the
recollection

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

how
was
it

You
loved
him

*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
felt
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
being
able
now
to
talk
to
her
mother
*NL*
on
equal
terms
about
those
questions
of
such
paramount
interest
in
a

woman

life

*NL*
*NL*

Of

always

*NL*
``

she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
three
women
all
fell
to
musing
on
the
same
thing
.
Kitty
was
the
*NL*
first
to
break
the
silence
.
She
remembered
all
that
last
winter
before
*NL*
her
marriage
,
and
her
passion
for
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
...
that
old
love
affair
of
Varenka
's
,
''
she
said
,
a
*NL*
natural
chain
of
ideas
bringing
her
to
this
point
.
``
I
should
have
liked
*NL*
to
say
something
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch

to
prepare
him

They
're
all

all
*NL*
men

she
added
,
``
awfully
jealous
over
our
past

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
all
,

said
Dolly
.
``
You
judge
by
your
own

makes
him

miserable
even
now

remember
Vronsky

Eh

that
's
true
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Kitty
answered
,
a
pensive
smile
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
really
do
n't
know

the
mother
put
in
in
defense
of
her
motherly
*NL*
care
of
her
daughter
,
``
what
there
was
in
your
past
that
could
worry
him

Vronsky
paid
you
attentions

that
happens
to
every
girl

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

we
did

Kitty
said
,
flushing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
let
me
speak

her
mother
went
on
,
``
why

you
yourself

not
let
*NL*
me
have
a
talk
to

Do
n't
you
remember
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

mamma

said
Kitty
,
with
an
expression
of
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
keeping

myself

have
called

explain
himself

my

it

not

*NL*

*NL*

happy
it
was

turned
out
quite

she
said

struck
by
*NL*
her
own
ideas

``
Then

was
so
happy

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice

*NL*
her
mother
,
who
could
not
forget
that

married
not
Vronsky

*NL*
Levin

*NL*
*NL*
``

Kitty
said
with
annoyance

never

n't
*NL*
want

she
said
,
catching
the
sound
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
well-known
step
on
the
steps
of
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
do
n't
want

inquired
Levin
,
coming
onto
*NL*
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
one
answered
him
,
and
he
did
not
repeat
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
've
broken
in
on
your
feminine
parliament

he
said
,
looking
*NL*
round
on
every
one
discontentedly
,
and
perceiving
that
they
had
been
*NL*
talking
of
something
which
they
would
not
talk
about
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
second
he
felt
that
he
was
sharing
the
feeling
of
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
vexation
at
their
making
jam
without
water
,
and
altogether
at
*NL*
the
outside
Shtcherbatsky
element

He
smiled
,
however
,
and
went
up
to
*NL*
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

how
are
you

he
asked
her

looking
at
her
with
the
expression
*NL*
with
which
everyone
looked
at
her
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

smiling

*NL*
``
What

*NL*

*NL*
Levin
never
called
the
princess
``
maman

as
men
often
do
call
their
*NL*
mothers-in-law
,
and
the
princess
disliked
his
not
doing
so
.
But
though
*NL*
he
liked
and
respected
the
princess
,
Levin
could
not
call
her
so
without
*NL*
a
sense
of
profaning
his
feeling
for
his
dead
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

Kitty
got
up
and
went
to
her

husband
and
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
well

Levin

smiling
to

trying

cheer

up

Kitty
,
at
once
divining
her

motive

and
addressing
*NL*
the
old
housekeeper
with
the
same
feeling
;
``

good

added

smiling

*NL*
putting
her
kerchief
straight

*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
looked
angrily
at
Kitty

*NL*
*NL*
``

something
in
the
rough

familiarity

touched
Kitty

Kitty
was
particularly
glad
of
a
chance
of
being
alone
with
her
husband
,
*NL*
for
she
had
noticed
the
shade
of
mortification
that
had
passed
over
his
*NL*
face
--
always
so
quick
to
reflect
every
feeling
--
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
had
come
onto
the
terrace
and
asked
what
they
were
talking
of
,
and
had
*NL*
got
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
set
off
on
foot
ahead
of
the
others
,
and
had
come
out
of
*NL*
sight
of
the
house
onto
the
beaten
dusty
road
,
marked
with
rusty
wheels
*NL*
and
sprinkled
with
grains
of
corn
,
she
clung
faster
to
his
arm
and
*NL*
pressed
it
closer
to
her
.
He
had
quite
forgotten
the
momentary
*NL*
unpleasant
impression
,
and
alone
with
her
he
felt
,
now
that
the
thought
*NL*
of
her
approaching
motherhood
was
never
for
a
moment
absent
from
his
*NL*
mind
,
a
new
and
delicious
bliss
,
quite
pure
from
all
alloy
of
sense
,
in
*NL*
the
being
near
to
the
woman
he
loved
.
There
was
no
need
of
speech
,
yet
*NL*
he
longed
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
which
like
her
eyes
had
*NL*
changed
since
she
had
been
with
child
.
In
her
voice
,
as
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
there
was
that
softness
and
gravity
which
is
found
in
people
continually
*NL*
concentrated
on
some
cherished
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
not
tired
?
Lean
more
on
me
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
so
glad
of
a
chance
of
being
alone
with
you
,
and
I
must
own
,
*NL*
though
I
'm
happy
with
them
,
I
do
regret
our
winter
evenings
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
good
,
but
this
is
even
better
.
Both
are
better
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
squeezing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
we
were
talking
about
when
you
came
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
jam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
about
jam
too
;
but
afterwards
,
about
how
men
make
offers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Levin
,
listening
more
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
than
to
the
*NL*
words
she
was
saying
,
and
all
the
while
paying
attention
to
the
road
,
*NL*
which
passed
now
through
the
forest
,
and
avoiding
places
where
she
might
*NL*
make
a
false
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
about
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Varenka
.
You
've
noticed
?
...
I
'm
very
*NL*
anxious
for
it
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
What
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
And
she
*NL*
peeped
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
,
''
Levin
answered
,
smiling
.
``
Sergey
seems
*NL*
very
strange
to
me
in
that
way
.
I
told
you
,
you
know
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
he
was
in
love
with
that
girl
who
died
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
when
I
was
a
child
;
I
know
about
it
from
hearsay
and
*NL*
tradition
.
I
remember
him
then
.
He
was
wonderfully
sweet
.
But
I
've
*NL*
watched
him
since
with
women
;
he
is
friendly
,
some
of
them
he
likes
,
but
*NL*
one
feels
that
to
him
they
're
simply
people
,
not
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
now
with
Varenka
...
I
fancy
there
's
something
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
there
is
...
But
one
has
to
know
him
...
He
's
a
peculiar
,
*NL*
wonderful
person
.
He
lives
a
spiritual
life
only
.
He
's
too
pure
,
too
*NL*
exalted
a
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Would
this
lower
him
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
he
's
so
used
to
a
spiritual
life
that
he
ca
n't
reconcile
*NL*
himself
with
actual
fact
,
and
Varenka
is
after
all
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
grown
used
by
now
to
uttering
his
thought
boldly
,
without
*NL*
taking
the
trouble
of
clothing
it
in
exact
language
.
He
knew
that
his
*NL*
wife
,
in
such
moments
of
loving
tenderness
as
now
,
would
understand
what
*NL*
he
meant
to
say
from
a
hint
,
and
she
did
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
there
's
not
so
much
of
that
actual
fact
about
her
as
about
me
.
*NL*
I
can
see
that
he
would
never
have
cared
for
me
.
She
is
altogether
*NL*
spiritual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
he
is
so
fond
of
you
,
and
I
am
always
so
glad
when
my
people
*NL*
like
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
very
nice
to
me
;
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
as
it
was
with
poor
Nikolay
...
you
really
cared
for
each
*NL*
other
,
''
Levin
finished
.
``
Why
not
speak
of
him
?
''
he
added
.
``
I
sometimes
*NL*
blame
myself
for
not
;
it
ends
in
one
's
forgetting
.
Ah
,
how
terrible
and
*NL*
dear
he
was
!
...
Yes
,
what
were
we
talking
about
?
''
Levin
said
,
after
a
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
he
ca
n't
fall
in
love
,
''
said
Kitty
,
translating
into
her
own
*NL*
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
so
much
that
he
ca
n't
fall
in
love
,
''
Levin
said
,
smiling
,
``
but
*NL*
he
has
not
the
weakness
necessary
...
I
've
always
envied
him
,
and
even
*NL*
now
,
when
I
'm
so
happy
,
I
still
envy
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
envy
him
for
not
being
able
to
fall
in
love
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
envy
him
for
being
better
than
I
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
He
does
not
live
for
*NL*
himself
.
His
whole
life
is
subordinated
to
his
duty
.
And
that
's
why
he
*NL*
can
be
calm
and
contented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
Kitty
asked
,
with
an
ironical
and
loving
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
never
have
explained
the
chain
of
thought
that
made
her
smile
;
*NL*
but
the
last
link
in
it
was
that
her
husband
,
in
exalting
his
brother
*NL*
and
abasing
himself
,
was
not
quite
sincere
.
Kitty
knew
that
this
*NL*
insincerity
came
from
his
love
for
his
brother
,
from
his
sense
of
shame
*NL*
at
being
too
happy
,
and
above
all
from
his
unflagging
craving
to
be
*NL*
better
--
she
loved
it
in
him
,
and
so
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
What
are
you
dissatisfied
with
?
''
she
asked
,
with
the
same
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
disbelief
in
his
self-dissatisfaction
delighted
him
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
he
tried
to
draw
her
into
giving
utterance
to
the
grounds
*NL*
of
her
disbelief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
happy
,
but
dissatisfied
with
myself
...
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
can
you
be
dissatisfied
with
yourself
if
you
are
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
shall
I
say
?
...
In
my
heart
I
really
care
for
nothing
*NL*
whatever
but
that
you
should
not
stumble
--
see
?
Oh
,
but
really
you
*NL*
must
n't
skip
about
like
that
!
''
he
cried
,
breaking
off
to
scold
her
for
*NL*
too
agile
a
movement
in
stepping
over
a
branch
that
lay
in
the
path
.
*NL*
``
But
when
I
think
about
myself
,
and
compare
myself
with
others
,
*NL*
especially
with
my
brother
,
I
feel
I
'm
a
poor
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
what
way
?
''
Kitty
pursued
with
the
same
smile
.
``
Do
n't
you
too
*NL*
work
for
others
?
What
about
your
co-operative
settlement
,
and
your
work
*NL*
on
the
estate
,
and
your
book
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
feel
,
and
particularly
just
now
--
it
's
your
fault
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
pressing
her
hand
--
``
that
all
that
does
n't
count
.
I
do
it
in
a
way
*NL*
halfheartedly
.
If
I
could
care
for
all
that
as
I
care
for
you
!
...
*NL*
Instead
of
that
,
I
do
it
in
these
days
like
a
task
that
is
set
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
would
you
say
about
papa
?
''
asked
Kitty
.
``
Is
he
a
poor
*NL*
creature
then
,
as
he
does
nothing
for
the
public
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
--
no
!
But
then
one
must
have
the
simplicity
,
the
*NL*
straightforwardness
,
the
goodness
of
your
father
:
and
I
have
n't
got
*NL*
that
.
I
do
nothing
,
and
I
fret
about
it
.
It
's
all
your
doing
.
Before
*NL*
there
was
you
--
and
_
this
_
too
,
''
he
added
with
a
glance
towards
her
waist
*NL*
that
she
understood
--
``
I
put
all
my
energies
into
work
;
now
I
ca
n't
,
and
*NL*
I
'm
ashamed
;
I
do
it
just
as
though
it
were
a
task
set
me
,
I
'm
*NL*
pretending
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
would
you
like
to
change
this
minute
with
Sergey
Ivanovitch
?
''
*NL*
said
Kitty
.
``
Would
you
like
to
do
this
work
for
the
general
good
,
and
to
*NL*
love
the
task
set
you
,
as
he
does
,
and
nothing
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
But
I
'm
so
happy
that
I
do
n't
understand
*NL*
anything
.
So
you
think
he
'll
make
her
an
offer
today
?
''
he
added
after
a
*NL*
brief
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
and
I
do
n't
think
so
.
Only
,
I
'm
awfully
anxious
for
it
.
*NL*
Here
,
wait
a
minute
.
''
She
stooped
down
and
picked
a
wild
camomile
at
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
path
.
``
Come
,
count
:
he
does
propose
,
he
does
n't
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
giving
him
the
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
,
he
does
n't
,
''
said
Levin
,
tearing
off
the
white
petals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
Kitty
,
snatching
at
his
hand
,
stopped
him
.
She
had
been
*NL*
watching
his
fingers
with
interest
.
``
You
picked
off
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
see
,
this
little
one
sha
n't
count
to
make
up
,
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
tearing
off
a
little
half-grown
petal
.
``
Here
's
the
wagonette
overtaking
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
tired

Kitty

called
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
you
can
get
in

the
horses
are
quiet
and
walking

*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
worth
while
to
get
in
,
they
were
quite
near
the
place
,
*NL*
and
all
walked
on
together

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
,
with
her
white
kerchief
on
her
black
hair
,
surrounded
by
the
*NL*
children
,
gaily
and
good-humoredly
looking
after
them
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
visibly
excited
at
the
possibility
of
receiving
a
declaration
from
*NL*
the
man
she
cared
for
,
was
very
attractive
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
walked
*NL*
beside
her
,
and
never
left
off
admiring
her
.
Looking
at
her
,
he
recalled
*NL*
all
the
delightful
things
he
had
heard
from
her
lips
,
all
the
good
he
*NL*
knew
about
her
,
and
became
more
and
more
conscious
that
the
feeling
he
*NL*
had
for
her
was
something
special
that
he
had
felt
long
,
long
ago
,
and
*NL*
only
once
,
in
his
early
youth
.
The
feeling
of
happiness
in
being
near
*NL*
her
continually
grew
,
and
at
last
reached
such
a
point
that
,
as
he
put
a
*NL*
huge
,
slender-stalked
agaric
fungus
in
her
basket
,
he
looked
straight
*NL*
into
her
face
,
and
noticing
the
flush
of
glad
and
alarmed
excitement
*NL*
that
overspread
her
face
,
he
was
confused
himself
,
and
smiled
to
her
in
*NL*
silence
a
smile
that
said
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
ought
to
think
it
over
and
make
up
my
*NL*
mind
,
and
not
give
way
like
a
boy
to
the
impulse
of
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
pick
by
myself
apart
from
all
the
rest
,
or
else
my
efforts
*NL*
will
make
no
show
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
left
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
*NL*
they
were
walking
on
low
silky
grass
between
old
birch
trees
standing
*NL*
far
apart
,
and
went
more
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
,
where
between
the
*NL*
white
birch
trunks
there
were
gray
trunks
of
aspen
and
dark
bushes
of
*NL*
hazel
.
Walking
some
forty
paces
away
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
knowing
he
was
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
stood
still
behind
a
bushy
spindle-tree
in
full
flower
*NL*
with
its
rosy
red
catkins
.
It
was
perfectly
still
all
round
him
.
Only
*NL*
overhead
in
the
birches
under
which
he
stood
,
the
flies
,
like
a
swarm
of
*NL*
bees
,
buzzed
unceasingly
,
and
from
time
to
time
the
children
's
voices
*NL*
were
floated
across
to
him
.
All
at
once
he
heard
,
not
far
from
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
wood
,
the
sound
of
Varenka
's
contralto
voice
,
calling
Grisha
,
and
*NL*
a
smile
of
delight
passed
over
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
face
.
Conscious
of
*NL*
this
smile
,
he
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
at
his
own
condition
,
and
*NL*
taking
out
a
cigar
,
he
began
lighting
it
.
For
a
long
while
he
could
not
*NL*
get
a
match
to
light
against
the
trunk
of
a
birch
tree
.
The
soft
scales
*NL*
of
the
white
bark
rubbed
off
the
phosphorus
,
and
the
light
went
out
.
At
*NL*
last
one
of
the
matches
burned
,
and
the
fragrant
cigar
smoke
,
hovering
*NL*
uncertainly
in
flat
,
wide
coils
,
stretched
away
forwards
and
upwards
*NL*
over
a
bush
under
the
overhanging
branches
of
a
birch
tree
.
Watching
the
*NL*
streak
of
smoke
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
walked
gently
on
,
deliberating
on
his
*NL*
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
thought
.
``
If
it
were
only
a
passing
fancy
or
a
passion
,
if
*NL*
it
were
only
this
attraction
--
this
mutual
attraction
-LRB-
I
can
call
it
a
*NL*
_
mutual
_
attraction
-RRB-
,
but
if
I
felt
that
it
was
in
contradiction
with
*NL*
the
whole
bent
of
my
life
--
if
I
felt
that
in
giving
way
to
this
*NL*
attraction
I
should
be
false
to
my
vocation
and
my
duty
...
but
it
's
not
*NL*
so
.
The
only
thing
I
can
say
against
it
is
that
,
when
I
lost
Marie
,
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
that
I
would
remain
faithful
to
her
memory
.
That
's
the
*NL*
only
thing
I
can
say
against
my
feeling
...
That
's
a
great
thing
,
''
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
said
to
himself
,
feeling
at
the
same
time
that
this
*NL*
consideration
had
not
the
slightest
importance
for
him
personally
,
but
*NL*
would
only
perhaps
detract
from
his
romantic
character
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
others
.
``
But
apart
from
that
,
however
much
I
searched
,
I
should
never
*NL*
find
anything
to
say
against
my
feeling
.
If
I
were
choosing
by
*NL*
considerations
of
suitability
alone
,
I
could
not
have
found
anything
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
many
women
and
girls
he
thought
of
whom
he
knew
,
he
could
not
*NL*
think
of
a
girl
who
united
to
such
a
degree
all
,
positively
all
,
the
*NL*
qualities
he
would
wish
to
see
in
his
wife
.
She
had
all
the
charm
and
*NL*
freshness
of
youth
,
but
she
was
not
a
child
;
and
if
she
loved
him
,
she
*NL*
loved
him
consciously
as
a
woman
ought
to
love
;
that
was
one
thing
.
*NL*
Another
point
:
she
was
not
only
far
from
being
worldly
,
but
had
an
*NL*
unmistakable
distaste
for
worldly
society
,
and
at
the
same
time
she
knew
*NL*
the
world
,
and
had
all
the
ways
of
a
woman
of
the
best
society
,
which
*NL*
were
absolutely
essential
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
conception
of
the
woman
*NL*
who
was
to
share
his
life
.
Thirdly
:
she
was
religious
,
and
not
like
a
*NL*
child
,
unconsciously
religious
and
good
,
as
Kitty
,
for
example
,
was
,
but
*NL*
her
life
was
founded
on
religious
principles
.
Even
in
trifling
matters
,
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
found
in
her
all
that
he
wanted
in
his
wife
:
she
was
*NL*
poor
and
alone
in
the
world
,
so
she
would
not
bring
with
her
a
mass
of
*NL*
relations
and
their
influence
into
her
husband
's
house
,
as
he
saw
now
in
*NL*
Kitty
's
case
.
She
would
owe
everything
to
her
husband
,
which
was
what
he
*NL*
had
always
desired
too
for
his
future
family
life
.
And
this
girl
,
who
*NL*
united
all
these
qualities
,
loved
him
.
He
was
a
modest
man
,
but
he
could
*NL*
not
help
seeing
it
.
And
he
loved
her
.
There
was
one
consideration
*NL*
against
it
--
his
age
.
But
he
came
of
a
long-lived
family
,
he
had
not
a
*NL*
single
gray
hair
,
no
one
would
have
taken
him
for
forty
,
and
he
*NL*
remembered
Varenka
's
saying
that
it
was
only
in
Russia
that
men
of
fifty
*NL*
thought
themselves
old
,
and
that
in
France
a
man
of
fifty
considers
*NL*
himself
_
dans
la
force
de
l'age
_
,
while
a
man
of
forty
is
_
un
jeune
*NL*
homme
_
.
But
what
did
the
mere
reckoning
of
years
matter
when
he
felt
as
*NL*
young
in
heart
as
he
had
been
twenty
years
ago
?
Was
it
not
youth
to
feel
*NL*
as
he
felt
now
,
when
coming
from
the
other
side
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
*NL*
he
saw
in
the
glowing
light
of
the
slanting
sunbeams
the
gracious
figure
*NL*
of
Varenka
in
her
yellow
gown
with
her
basket
,
walking
lightly
by
the
*NL*
trunk
of
an
old
birch
tree
,
and
when
this
impression
of
the
sight
of
*NL*
Varenka
blended
so
harmoniously
with
the
beauty
of
the
view
,
of
the
*NL*
yellow
oatfield
lying
bathed
in
the
slanting
sunshine
,
and
beyond
it
the
*NL*
distant
ancient
forest
flecked
with
yellow
and
melting
into
the
blue
of
*NL*
the
distance
?
His
heart
throbbed
joyously
.
A
softened
feeling
came
over
*NL*
him
.
He
felt
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
.
Varenka
,
who
had
just
*NL*
crouched
down
to
pick
a
mushroom
,
rose
with
a
supple
movement
and
looked
*NL*
round
.
Flinging
away
the
cigar
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
advanced
with
resolute
*NL*
steps
towards
her
.

``
Varvara
Andreevna
,
when
I
was
very
young

I
set
before
myself
the
ideal
*NL*
of
the
woman
I
loved
and
should
be
happy
to
call
my
wife
.
I
have
lived
*NL*
through
a
long
life
,
and
now
for
the
first
time
I
have
met
what
I
*NL*
sought
--
in
you
.
I
love
you
,
and
offer
you
my
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
saying
this
to
himself
while
he
was
ten
paces
from
*NL*
Varvara
.
Kneeling
down
,
with
her
hands
over
the
mushrooms
to
guard
them
*NL*
from
Grisha
,
she
was
calling
little
Masha
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
little
ones
!
There
are
so
many
!
''
she
was
saying
in
her
*NL*
sweet
,
deep
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
Sergey
Ivanovitch
approaching
,
she
did
not
get
up
and
did
not
*NL*
change
her
position
,
but
everything
told
him
that
she
felt
his
presence
*NL*
and
was
glad
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
find
some
?
''
she
asked
from
under
the
white
kerchief
,
*NL*
turning
her
handsome
,
gently
smiling
face
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
one
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
Did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
,
busy
with
the
children
who
thronged
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
too
,
near
the
twig
,
''
she
pointed
out
to
little
Masha
a
little
*NL*
fungus
,
split
in
half
across
its
rosy
cap
by
the
dry
grass
from
under
*NL*
which
it
thrust
itself
.
Varenka
got
up
while
Masha
picked
the
fungus
,
*NL*
breaking
it
into
two
white
halves
.
``
This
brings
back
my
childhood
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
moving
apart
from
the
children
beside
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
for
some
steps
in
silence
.
Varenka
saw
that
he
wanted
to
*NL*
speak
;
she
guessed
of
what
,
and
felt
faint
with
joy
and
panic
.
They
had
*NL*
walked
so
far
away
that
no
one
could
hear
them
now
,
but
still
he
did
not
*NL*
begin
to
speak
.
It
would
have
been
better
for
Varenka
to
be
silent
.
*NL*
After
a
silence
it
would
have
been
easier
for
them
to
say
what
they
*NL*
wanted
to
say
than
after
talking
about
mushrooms
.
But
against
her
own
*NL*
will
,
as
it
were
accidentally
,
Varenka
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
found
nothing
?
In
the
middle
of
the
wood
there
are
always
fewer
,
*NL*
though
.
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
sighed
and
made
no
answer
.
He
was
annoyed
*NL*
that
she
had
spoken
about
the
mushrooms
.
He
wanted
to
bring
her
back
to
*NL*
the
first
words
she
had
uttered
about
her
childhood
;
but
after
a
pause
*NL*
of
some
length
,
as
though
against
his
own
will
,
he
made
an
observation
*NL*
in
response
to
her
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
that
the
white
edible
funguses
are
found
principally
at
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
though
I
ca
n't
tell
them
apart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
minutes
more
passed
,
they
moved
still
further
away
from
the
*NL*
children
,
and
were
quite
alone
.
Varenka
's
heart
throbbed
so
that
she
*NL*
heard
it
beating
,
and
felt
that
she
was
turning
red
and
pale
and
red
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
the
wife
of
a
man
like
Koznishev
,
after
her
position
with
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
,
was
to
her
imagination
the
height
of
happiness
.
Besides
,
she
was
*NL*
almost
certain
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
.
And
this
moment
it
would
*NL*
have
to
be
decided
.
She
felt
frightened
.
She
dreaded
both
his
speaking
*NL*
and
his
not
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
or
never
it
must
be
said
--
that
Sergey
Ivanovitch
felt
too
.
*NL*
Everything
in
the
expression
,
the
flushed
cheeks
and
the
downcast
eyes
*NL*
of
Varenka
betrayed
a
painful
suspense
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
saw
it
and
*NL*
felt
sorry
for
her
.
He
felt
even
that
to
say
nothing
now
would
be
a
*NL*
slight
to
her
.
Rapidly
in
his
own
mind
he
ran
over
all
the
arguments
in
*NL*
support
of
his
decision
.
He
even
said
over
to
himself
the
words
in
which
*NL*
he
meant
to
put
his
offer
,
but
instead
of
those
words
,
some
utterly
*NL*
unexpected
reflection
that
occurred
to
him
made
him
ask
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
difference
between
the
`
birch
'
mushroom
and
the
`
white
'
*NL*
mushroom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
's
lips
quivered
with
emotion
as
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
top
part
there
is
scarcely
any
difference
,
it
's
in
the
stalk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
soon
as
these
words
were
uttered
,
both
he
and
she
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
over
,
that
what
was
to
have
been
said
would
not
be
said
;
and
their
*NL*
emotion
,
which
had
up
to
then
been
continually
growing
more
intense
,
*NL*
began
to
subside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
birch
mushroom
's
stalk
suggests
a
dark
man
's
chin
after
two
days
*NL*
without
shaving
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
speaking
quite
calmly
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
true
,
''
answered
Varenka
smiling
,
and
unconsciously
the
*NL*
direction
of
their
walk
changed
.
They
began
to
turn
towards
the
*NL*
children
.
Varenka
felt
both
sore
and
ashamed
;
at
the
same
time
she
had
a
*NL*
sense
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
got
home
again
and
went
over
the
whole
subject
,
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
thought
his
previous
decision
had
been
a
mistaken
one
.
He
*NL*
could
not
be
false
to
the
memory
of
Marie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gently
,
children
,
gently
!
''
Levin
shouted
quite
angrily
to
the
children
,
*NL*
standing
before
his
wife
to
protect
her
when
the
crowd
of
children
flew
*NL*
with
shrieks
of
delight
to
meet
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
children
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Varenka
walked
out
of
the
*NL*
wood
.
Kitty
had
no
need
to
ask
Varenka
;
she
saw
from
the
calm
and
*NL*
somewhat
crestfallen
faces
of
both
that
her
plans
had
not
come
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
her
husband
questioned
her
as
they
were
going
home
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
bite
,
''
said
Kitty
,
her
smile
and
manner
of
speaking
*NL*
recalling
her
father
,
a
likeness
Levin
often
noticed
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
n't
bite
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
,
''
she
said
,
taking
her
husband
's
hand
,
lifting
it
to
her
*NL*
mouth
,
and
just
faintly
brushing
it
with
closed
lips
.
``
Like
a
kiss
on
a
*NL*
priest
's
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
did
n't
it
bite
with
?
''
he
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
.
But
it
should
have
been
like
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
peasants
coming
...

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
did
n't
see

*NL*
During
the
time
of
the
children
's
tea
the
grown-up
people
sat
in
the
*NL*
balcony
and
talked
as
though
nothing
had
happened
,
though
they
all
,
*NL*
especially
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Varenka
,
were
very
well
aware
that
*NL*
there
had
happened
an
event
which
,
though
negative
,
was
of
very
great
*NL*
importance
.
They
both
had
the
same
feeling
,
rather
like
that
of
a
*NL*
schoolboy
after
an
examination
,
which
has
left
him
in
the
same
class
or
*NL*
shut
him
out
of
the
school
forever
.
Everyone
present
,
feeling
too
that
*NL*
something
had
happened
,
talked
eagerly
about
extraneous
subjects
.
Levin
*NL*
and
Kitty
were
particularly
happy
and
conscious
of
their
love
that
*NL*
evening
.
And
their
happiness
in
their
love
seemed
to
imply
a
*NL*
disagreeable
slur
on
those
who
would
have
liked
to
feel
the
same
and
*NL*
could
not
--
and
they
felt
a
prick
of
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mark
my
words
,
Alexander
will
not
come
,
''
said
the
old
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
they
were
expecting
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
to
come
down
by
*NL*
train
,
and
the
old
prince
had
written
that
possibly
he
might
come
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
why
,
''
the
princess
went
on
;
``
he
says
that
young
people
ought
*NL*
to
be
left
alone
for
a
while
at
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
papa
has
left
us
alone
.
We
've
never
seen
him
,
''
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
``
Besides
,
we
're
not
young
people
!
--
we
're
old
,
married
people
by
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
if
he
does
n't
come
,
I
shall
say
good-bye
to
you
children
,
''
said
*NL*
the
princess
,
sighing
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
nonsense
,
mamma
!
''
both
the
daughters
fell
upon
her
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
suppose
he
is
feeling
?
Why
,
now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
there
was
an
unexpected
quiver
in
the
princess
's
voice
.
Her
*NL*
daughters
were
silent
,
and
looked
at
one
another
.
``
Maman
always
finds
*NL*
something
to
be
miserable
about
,
''
they
said
in
that
glance
.
They
did
not
*NL*
know
that
happy
as
the
princess
was
in
her
daughter
's
house
,
and
useful
*NL*
as
she
felt
herself
to
be
there
,
she
had
been
extremely
miserable
,
both
*NL*
on
her
own
account
and
her
husband
's
,
ever
since
they
had
married
their
*NL*
last
and
favorite
daughter
,
and
the
old
home
had
been
left
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
?
''
Kitty
asked
suddenly
of
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
,
who
was
standing
with
a
mysterious
air
,
and
a
face
full
of
*NL*
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
right
,
''
said
Dolly
;
``
you
go
and
arrange
about
it
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
go
and
hear
Grisha
repeat
his
lesson
,
or
else
he
will
have
nothing
done
*NL*
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
lesson
!
No
,
Dolly
,
I
'm
going
,
''
said
Levin
,
jumping
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grisha
,
who
was
by
now
at
a
high
school
,
had
to
go
over
the
lessons
of
*NL*
the
term
in
the
summer
holidays
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
who
had
been
*NL*
studying
Latin
with
her
son
in
Moscow
before
,
had
made
it
a
rule
on
*NL*
coming
to
the
Levins
'
to
go
over
with
him
,
at
least
once
a
day
,
the
most
*NL*
difficult
lessons
of
Latin
and
arithmetic
.
Levin
had
offered
to
take
her
*NL*
place
,
but
the
mother
,
having
once
overheard
Levin
's
lesson
,
and
*NL*
noticing
that
it
was
not
given
exactly
as
the
teacher
in
Moscow
had
*NL*
given
it
,
said
resolutely
,
though
with
much
embarrassment
and
anxiety
*NL*
not
to
mortify
Levin
,
that
they
must
keep
strictly
to
the
book
as
the
*NL*
teacher
had
done
,
and
that
she
had
better
undertake
it
again
herself
.
*NL*
Levin
was
amazed
both
at
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
,
by
neglecting
his
*NL*
duty
,
threw
upon
the
mother
the
supervision
of
studies
of
which
she
had
*NL*
no
comprehension
,
and
at
the
teachers
for
teaching
the
children
so
*NL*
badly
.
But
he
promised
his
sister-in-law
to
give
the
lessons
exactly
as
*NL*
she
wished
.
And
he
went
on
teaching
Grisha
,
not
in
his
own
way
,
but
by
*NL*
the
book
,
and
so
took
little
interest
in
it
,
and
often
forgot
the
hour
*NL*
of
the
lesson
.
So
it
had
been
today
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
going
,
Dolly
,
you
sit
still
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
'll
do
it
all
*NL*
properly
,
like
the
book
.
Only
when
Stiva
comes
,
and
we
go
out
shooting
,
*NL*
then
we
shall
have
to
miss
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
went
to
Grisha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Varenka
was
saying
the
same
thing
to
Kitty
.
Even
in
the
happy
,
*NL*
well-ordered
household
of
the
Levins
Varenka
had
succeeded
in
making
*NL*
herself
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
to
the
supper
,
you
sit
still
,
''
she
said
,
and
got
up
to
go
to
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
most
likely
they
've
not
been
able
to
get
chickens
.
If
so
,
*NL*
ours
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agafea
Mihalovna
and
I
will
see
about
it
,
''
and
Varenka
vanished
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
nice
girl
!
''
said
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
nice
,
maman
;
she
's
an
exquisite
girl
;
there
's
no
one
else
like
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
expecting
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
today
?
''
said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
evidently
not
disposed
to
pursue
the
conversation
about
*NL*
Varenka
.
``
It
would
be
difficult
to
find
two
sons-in-law
more
unlike
than
*NL*
yours
,
''
he
said
with
a
subtle
smile
.
``
One
all
movement
,
only
living
in
*NL*
society
,
like
a
fish
in
water
;
the
other
our
Kostya
,
lively
,
alert
,
*NL*
quick
in
everything
,
but
as
soon
as
he
is
in
society
,
he
either
sinks
*NL*
into
apathy
,
or
struggles
helplessly
like
a
fish
on
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
very
heedless
,
''
said
the
princess
,
addressing
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
.
``
I
've
been
meaning
,
indeed
,
to
ask
you
to
tell
him
that
it
's
*NL*
out
of
the
question
for
her
''
-LRB-
she
indicated
Kitty
-RRB-
``
to
stay
here
;
that
*NL*
she
positively
must
come
to
Moscow
.
He
talks
of
getting
a
doctor
*NL*
down
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maman
,
he
'll
do
everything
;
he
has
agreed
to
everything
,
''
Kitty
said
,
*NL*
angry
with
her
mother
for
appealing
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
to
judge
in
*NL*
such
a
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
their
conversation
they
heard
the
snorting
of
horses
*NL*
and
the
sound
of
wheels
on
the
gravel
.
Dolly
had
not
time
to
get
up
to
*NL*
go
and
meet
her
husband
,
when
from
the
window
of
the
room
below
,
where
*NL*
Grisha
was
having
his
lesson
,
Levin
leaped
out
and
helped
Grisha
out
*NL*
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Stiva
!
''
Levin
shouted
from
under
the
balcony
.
``
We
've
finished
,
*NL*
Dolly
,
do
n't
be
afraid
!
''
he
added
,
and
started
running
like
a
boy
to
*NL*
meet
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Is
ea
id
,
ejus
,
ejus
,
ejus
!
_
''
shouted
Grisha
,
skipping
along
the
*NL*
avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
some
one
else
too
!
Papa
,
of
course
!
''
cried
Levin
,
stopping
at
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
avenue
.
``
Kitty
,
do
n't
come
down
the
steep
staircase
,
go
*NL*
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
had
been
mistaken
in
taking
the
person
sitting
in
the
carriage
*NL*
for
the
old
prince
.
As
he
got
nearer
to
the
carriage
he
saw
beside
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
not
the
prince
but
a
handsome
,
stout
young
man
in
a
*NL*
Scotch
cap
,
with
long
ends
of
ribbon
behind
.
This
was
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
a
distant
cousin
of
the
Shtcherbatskys
,
a
brilliant
young
*NL*
gentleman
in
Petersburg
and
Moscow
society
.
``
A
capital
fellow
,
and
a
*NL*
keen
sportsman
,
''
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
,
introducing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
whit
abashed
by
the
disappointment
caused
by
his
having
come
in
*NL*
place
of
the
old
prince
,
Veslovsky
greeted
Levin
gaily
,
claiming
*NL*
acquaintance
with
him
in
the
past
,
and
snatching
up
Grisha
into
the
*NL*
carriage
,
lifted
him
over
the
pointer
that
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
*NL*
brought
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
get
into
the
carriage
,
but
walked
behind
.
He
was
rather
*NL*
vexed
at
the
non-arrival
of
the
old
prince
,
whom
he
liked
more
and
more
*NL*
the
more
he
saw
of
him
,
and
also
at
the
arrival
of
this
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
a
quite
uncongenial
and
superfluous
person
.
He
seemed
to
him
*NL*
still
more
uncongenial
and
superfluous
when
,
on
approaching
the
steps
*NL*
where
the
whole
party
,
children
and
grown-up
,
were
gathered
together
in
*NL*
much
excitement
,
Levin
saw
Vassenka
Veslovsky
,
with
a
particularly
warm
*NL*
and
gallant
air
,
kissing
Kitty
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wife
and
I
are
cousins
and
very
old
friends
,
''
said
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
once
more
shaking
Levin
's
hand
with
great
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
there
plenty
of
birds
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
Levin
,
*NL*
hardly
leaving
time
for
everyone
to
utter
their
greetings
.
``
We
've
come
*NL*
with
the
most
savage
intentions
.
Why
,
maman
,
they
've
not
been
in
Moscow
*NL*
since
!
Look
,
Tanya
,
here
's
something
for
you
!
Get
it
,
please
,
it
's
in
*NL*
the
carriage
,
behind
!
''
he
talked
in
all
directions
.
``
How
pretty
you
've
*NL*
grown
,
Dolly
,
''
he
said
to
his
wife
,
once
more
kissing
her
hand
,
holding
*NL*
it
in
one
of
his
,
and
patting
it
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
who
a
minute
before
had
been
in
the
happiest
frame
of
mind
,
now
*NL*
looked
darkly
at
everyone
,
and
everything
displeased
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
he
kissed
yesterday
with
those
lips
?
''
he
thought
,
looking
at
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
tender
demonstrations
to
his
wife
.
He
looked
at
*NL*
Dolly
,
and
he
did
not
like
her
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
believe
in
his
love
.
So
what
is
she
so
pleased
about
?
*NL*
Revolting
!
''
thought
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
princess
,
who
had
been
so
dear
to
him
a
minute
before
,
*NL*
and
he
did
not
like
the
manner
in
which
she
welcomed
this
Vassenka
,
with
*NL*
his
ribbons
,
just
as
though
she
were
in
her
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
had
come
out
too
onto
the
steps
,
seemed
to
*NL*
him
unpleasant
with
the
show
of
cordiality
with
which
he
met
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
though
Levin
knew
that
his
brother
neither
liked
nor
*NL*
respected
Oblonsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Varenka
,
even
she
seemed
hateful
,
with
her
air
_
sainte
nitouche
_
*NL*
making
the
acquaintance
of
this
gentleman
,
while
all
the
while
she
was
*NL*
thinking
of
nothing
but
getting
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
more
hateful
than
anyone
was
Kitty
for
falling
in
with
the
tone
of
*NL*
gaiety
with
which
this
gentleman
regarded
his
visit
in
the
country
,
as
*NL*
though
it
were
a
holiday
for
himself
and
everyone
else
.
And
,
above
all
,
*NL*
unpleasant
was
that
particular
smile
with
which
she
responded
to
his
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noisily
talking
,
they
all
went
into
the
house
;
but
as
soon
as
they
were
*NL*
all
seated
,
Levin
turned
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
saw
something
was
wrong
with
her
husband
.
She
tried
to
seize
a
*NL*
moment
to
speak
to
him
alone
,
but
he
made
haste
to
get
away
from
her
,
*NL*
saying
he
was
wanted
at
the
counting-house
.
It
was
long
since
his
own
*NL*
work
on
the
estate
had
seemed
to
him
so
important
as
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
``
It
's
all
holiday
for
them
,
''
he
thought
;
``
but
these
are
no
holiday
*NL*
matters
,
they
wo
n't
wait
,
and
there
's
no
living
without
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
Levin
came
back
to
the
house
only
when
they
sent
to
summon
him
to
*NL*
supper
.
On
the
stairs
were
standing
Kitty
and
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
*NL*
consulting
about
wines
for
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are

*NL*
``
No

Kostya

stop
,
what
's
the
matter

''
Kitty
*NL*
began
,
hurrying
after
him
,
but
he
strode
ruthlessly
away
to
the
dining
*NL*
room
without
waiting
for
her
,
and
at
once
joined
in
the
lively
general
*NL*
conversation
which
was
being
maintained
there
by
Vassenka
Veslovsky
and
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
,
are
we
going
shooting
tomorrow

said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please

do
let
's
go

''
said
Veslovsky
,
moving
to
another
chair
,
where
he
*NL*
sat
down
sideways
,
with
one
fat
leg
crossed
under
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
delighted
,
we
will
go

And
have
you
had
any
shooting
yet
*NL*
this

''
said
Levin
to
Veslovsky
,
looking
intently
at
his
leg
,
but
*NL*
speaking
with
that
forced
amiability
that
Kitty
knew
so
well
in
him
,
and
*NL*
that
was
so
out
of
keeping
with
him
.
``
I
ca
n't
answer
for
our
finding
*NL*
grouse

but
there
are
plenty

Only

to
start
early

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Yes

Veslovsky
chimed
in

*NL*
``
Oh

all

can
do
without

Dolly
said
to
her
husband
,
with
that
faint
note
of
irony
in
her
*NL*
voice
which
she
almost
always
had
now
with
her
husband
.
``
But

going
round

behind
the

*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
crossed
over
to
the
ladies

sat
down
beside
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
appealed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
left
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
and
though
never
pausing
*NL*
in
his
conversation
with
the
princess
and
Varenka
,
he
saw
that
there
was
*NL*
an
eager
and
mysterious
conversation
going
on
between
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
Dolly
,
Kitty

and
Veslovsky

And
that
was
not
all

He
saw

on
his
wife
's
face
an
expression
of
real
feeling
as
she
gazed
with
fixed
*NL*
eyes
on
the
handsome
face
of
Vassenka
,
who
was
telling
them
something
*NL*
with
great
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
exceedingly
nice
at
their
place
,
''
Veslovsky
was
telling
them
about
*NL*
Vronsky
and
Anna
.
``
I
ca
n't
,
of
course
,
take
it
upon
myself
to
judge
,
but
*NL*
in
their
house
you
feel
the
real
feeling
of
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
they
intend
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
they
think
of
going
to
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
jolly
it
would
be
for
us
all
to
go
over
to
them
together
!
When
are
*NL*
you
going
there
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
asked
Vassenka
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
spending
July
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
go
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
wanting
to
a
long
while
;
I
shall
certainly
go
,
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
her
,
and
I
know
her
.
She
's
a
splendid
woman
.
I
will
go
*NL*
alone
,
when
you
go
back
,
and
then
I
shall
be
in
no
one
's
way
.
And
it
*NL*
will
be
better
indeed
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
And
you
,
Kitty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Why
should
I
go
?
''
Kitty
said
,
flushing
all
over
,
and
she
glanced
*NL*
round
at
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
then
?
''
Veslovsky
asked
her
.
``
She
's
a
very
*NL*
fascinating
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
Veslovsky
,
crimsoning
still
more
.
She
got
up
and
*NL*
walked
across
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
shooting
,
then
,
tomorrow
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
jealousy
had
in
these
few
moments
,
especially
at
the
flush
that
had
*NL*
overspread
her
cheeks
while
she
was
talking
to
Veslovsky
,
gone
far
*NL*
indeed
.
Now
as
he
heard
her
words
,
he
construed
them
in
his
own
fashion
.
*NL*
Strange
as
it
was
to
him
afterwards
to
recall
it
,
it
seemed
to
him
at
*NL*
the
moment
clear
that
in
asking
whether
he
was
going
shooting
,
all
she
*NL*
cared
to
know
was
whether
he
would
give
that
pleasure
to
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
with
whom
,
as
he
fancied
,
she
was
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
going
,
''
he
answered
her
in
an
unnatural
voice
,
disagreeable
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
better
spend
the
day
here
tomorrow
,
or
Dolly
wo
n't
see
anything
of
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
set
off
the
day
after
,
''
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
motive
of
Kitty
's
words
was
interpreted
by
Levin
thus
:
``
Do
n't
*NL*
separate
me
from
_
him
_
.
I
do
n't
care
about
_
your
_
going
,
but
do
let
me
*NL*
enjoy
the
society
of
this
delightful
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
you
wish
,
we
'll
stay
here
tomorrow
,
''
Levin
answered
,
with
*NL*
peculiar
amiability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
meanwhile
,
utterly
unsuspecting
the
misery
his
presence
had
*NL*
occasioned
,
got
up
from
the
table
after
Kitty
,
and
watching
her
with
*NL*
smiling
and
admiring
eyes
,
he
followed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
saw
that
look
.
He
turned
white
,
and
for
a
minute
he
could
hardly
*NL*
breathe
.
``
How
dare
he
look
at
my
wife
like
that
!
''
was
the
feeling
that
*NL*
boiled
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
,
then
?
Do
,
please
,
let
us
go
,
''
said
Vassenka
,
sitting
down
on
*NL*
a
chair
,
and
again
crossing
his
leg
as
his
habit
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
's
jealousy
went
further
still
.
Already
he
saw
himself
a
deceived
*NL*
husband
,
looked
upon
by
his
wife
and
her
lover
as
simply
necessary
to
*NL*
provide
them
with
the
conveniences
and
pleasures
of
life
...
But
in
*NL*
spite
of
that
he
made
polite
and
hospitable
inquiries
of
Vassenka
about
*NL*
his
shooting
,
his
gun
,
and
his
boots
,
and
agreed
to
go
shooting
next
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
Levin
,
the
old
princess
cut
short
his
agonies
by
getting
up
*NL*
herself
and
advising
Kitty
to
go
to
bed
.
But
even
at
this
point
Levin
*NL*
could
not
escape
another
agony
.
As
he
said
good-night
to
his
hostess
,
*NL*
Vassenka
would
again
have
kissed
her
hand
,
but
Kitty
,
reddening
,
drew
*NL*
back
her
hand
and
said
with
a
naive
bluntness
,
for
which
the
old
*NL*
princess
scolded
her
afterwards
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
like
that
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Levin
's
eyes
she
was
to
blame
for
having
allowed
such
relations
to
*NL*
arise
,
and
still
more
to
blame
for
showing
so
awkwardly
that
she
did
not
*NL*
like
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
can
one
want
to
go
to
bed
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
,
*NL*
after
drinking
several
glasses
of
wine
at
supper
,
was
now
in
his
most
*NL*
charming
and
sentimental
humor
.
``
Look
,
Kitty
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
moon
,
which
had
just
risen
behind
the
lime
trees
--
``
how
exquisite
!
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
this
is
the
time
for
a
serenade
.
You
know
,
he
has
a
splendid
*NL*
voice
;
we
practiced
songs
together
along
the
road
.
He
has
brought
some
*NL*
lovely
songs
with
him
,
two
new
ones
.
Varvara
Andreevna
and
he
must
sing
*NL*
some
duets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
party
had
broken
up
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
walked
a
long
while
*NL*
about
the
avenue
with
Veslovsky
;
their
voices
could
be
heard
singing
one
*NL*
of
the
new
songs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
hearing
these
voices
sat
scowling
in
an
easy-chair
in
his
wife
's
*NL*
bedroom
,
and
maintained
an
obstinate
silence
when
she
asked
him
what
was
*NL*
wrong
.
But
when
at
last
with
a
timid
glance
she
hazarded
the
question
:
*NL*
``
Was
there
perhaps
something
you
disliked
about
Veslovsky
?
''
--
it
all
*NL*
burst
out
,
and
he
told
her
all
.
He
was
humiliated
himself
at
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
,
and
that
exasperated
him
all
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
facing
her
with
his
eyes
glittering
menacingly
under
his
*NL*
scowling
brows
,
and
he
squeezed
his
strong
arms
across
his
chest
,
as
*NL*
though
he
were
straining
every
nerve
to
hold
himself
in
.
The
expression
*NL*
of
his
face
would
have
been
grim
,
and
even
cruel
,
if
it
had
not
at
the
*NL*
same
time
had
a
look
of
suffering
which
touched
her
.
His
jaws
were
*NL*
twitching
,
and
his
voice
kept
breaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
understand
that
I
'm
not
jealous
,
that
's
a
nasty
word
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
be
jealous
,
and
believe
that
...
I
ca
n't
say
what
I
feel
,
but
this
is
*NL*
awful
...
I
'm
not
jealous
,
but
I
'm
wounded
,
humiliated
that
anybody
dare
*NL*
think
,
that
anybody
dare
look
at
you
with
eyes
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eyes
like
what
?
''
said
Kitty
,
trying
as
conscientiously
as
possible
to
*NL*
recall
every
word
and
gesture
of
that
evening
and
every
shade
implied
in
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
bottom
of
her
heart
she
did
think
there
had
been
something
*NL*
precisely
at
the
moment
when
he
had
crossed
over
after
her
to
the
other
*NL*
end
of
the
table
;
but
she
dared
not
own
it
even
to
herself
,
and
would
*NL*
have
been
even
more
unable
to
bring
herself
to
say
so
to
him
,
and
so
*NL*
increase
his
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
can
there
possibly
be
attractive
about
me
as
I
am
now
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
cried
,
clutching
at
his
head
,
``
you
should
n't
say
that
!
...
If
*NL*
you
had
been
attractive
then
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
Kostya
,
oh
,
wait
a
minute
,
oh
,
do
listen
!
''
she
said
,
looking
at
*NL*
him
with
an
expression
of
pained
commiseration
.
``
Why
,
what
can
you
be
*NL*
thinking
about
!
When
for
me
there
's
no
one
in
the
world
,
no
one
,
no
*NL*
one
!
...
Would
you
like
me
never
to
see
anyone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
minute
she
had
been
offended
at
his
jealousy
;
she
was
*NL*
angry
that
the
slightest
amusement
,
even
the
most
innocent
,
should
be
*NL*
forbidden
her
;
but
now
she
would
readily
have
sacrificed
,
not
merely
*NL*
such
trifles
,
but
everything
,
for
his
peace
of
mind
,
to
save
him
from
*NL*
the
agony
he
was
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
understand
the
horror
and
comedy
of
my
position
,
''
he
went
on
*NL*
in
a
desperate
whisper
;
``
that
he
's
in
my
house
,
that
he
's
done
nothing
*NL*
improper
positively
except
his
free
and
easy
airs
and
the
way
he
sits
on
*NL*
his
legs
.
He
thinks
it
's
the
best
possible
form
,
and
so
I
'm
obliged
to
*NL*
be
civil
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Kostya
,
you
're
exaggerating
,
''
said
Kitty
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
*NL*
heart
rejoicing
at
the
depth
of
his
love
for
her
,
shown
now
in
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
awful
part
of
it
all
is
that
you
're
just
as
you
always
are
,
*NL*
and
especially
now
when
to
me
you
're
something
sacred
,
and
we
're
so
*NL*
happy
,
so
particularly
happy
--
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
little
wretch
...
*NL*
He
's
not
a
little
wretch
;
why
should
I
abuse
him
?
I
have
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
him
.
But
why
should
my
,
and
your
,
happiness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
understand
now
what
it
's
all
come
from
,
''
Kitty
was
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
how
you
looked
while
we
were
talking
at
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
Levin
said
in
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
what
they
had
been
talking
about
.
And
as
she
told
him
,
she
*NL*
was
breathless
with
emotion
.
Levin
was
silent
for
a
space
,
then
he
*NL*
scanned
her
pale
and
distressed
face
,
and
suddenly
he
clutched
at
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katya

I
've
been
worrying
you

Darling

forgive
me

It

madness

*NL*
Katya

I

a
criminal

And
how
could
you
be
so
distressed
at
such
*NL*
idiocy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
was
sorry
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

for
me

How
mad
I
am

But
why
make
you
miserable
?
It
's
awful
*NL*
to
think
that
any
outsider
can
shatter
our
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
humiliating
too
,
of
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

then
I
'll
keep
him
here
all
the
summer

will
overwhelm

said
Levin
,
kissing
her
hands

``
You

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
before
the
ladies
were
up
,
the
wagonette
and
a
trap
for
the
*NL*
shooting
party
were
at
the
door
,
and
Laska
,
aware
since
early
morning
*NL*
that
they
were
going
shooting
,
after
much
whining
and
darting
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
had
sat
herself
down
in
the
wagonette
beside
the
coachman
,
and
,
*NL*
disapproving
of
the
delay
,
was
excitedly
watching
the
door
from
which
*NL*
the
sportsmen
still
did
not
come
out
.
The
first
to
come
out
was
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
in
new
high
boots
that
reached
half-way
up
his
thick
thighs
,
*NL*
in
a
green
blouse
,
with
a
new
Russian
leather
cartridge-belt
,
and
in
his
*NL*
Scotch
cap
with
ribbons
,
with
a
brand-new
English
gun
without
a
sling
.
*NL*
Laska
flew
up
to
him
,
welcomed
him
,
and
jumping
up
,
asked
him
in
her
own
*NL*
way
whether
the
others
were
coming
soon
,
but
getting
no
answer
from
him
,
*NL*
she
returned
to
her
post
of
observation
and
sank
into
repose
again
,
her
*NL*
head
on
one
side
,
and
one
ear
pricked
up
to
listen
.
At
last
the
door
*NL*
opened
with
a
creak
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
spot-and-tan
pointer
Krak
*NL*
flew
out
,
running
round
and
round
and
turning
over
in
the
air
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
himself
followed
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
a
cigar
in
his
*NL*
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
dog
,
good
dog
,
Krak
!
''
he
cried
encouragingly
to
the
dog
,
who
put
*NL*
his
paws
up
on
his
chest
,
catching
at
his
game
bag
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
was
dressed
in
rough
leggings
and
spats
,
in
torn
trousers
and
a
short
*NL*
coat
.
On
his
head
there
was
a
wreck
of
a
hat
of
indefinite
form
,
but
his
*NL*
gun
of
a
new
patent
was
a
perfect
gem
,
and
his
game
bag
and
cartridge
*NL*
belt
,
though
worn
,
were
of
the
very
best
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
Veslovsky
had
had
no
notion
before
that
it
was
truly
_
chic
_
for
*NL*
a
sportsman
to
be
in
tatters
,
but
to
have
his
shooting
outfit
of
the
*NL*
best
quality
.
He
saw
it
now
as
he
looked
at
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
radiant
*NL*
in
his
rags
,
graceful
,
well-fed
,
and
joyous
,
a
typical
Russian
nobleman
.
*NL*
And
he
made
up
his
mind
that
next
time
he
went
shooting
he
would
*NL*
certainly
adopt
the
same
get-up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
about
our
host
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
wife
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
such
a
charming
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
came
down
dressed
.
No
doubt
he
's
run
up
to
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
guessed
right
.
Levin
had
run
up
again
to
his
wife
to
*NL*
ask
her
once
more
if
she
forgave
him
for
his
idiocy
yesterday
,
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
to
beg
her
for
Christ
's
sake
to
be
more
careful
.
The
great
*NL*
thing
was
for
her
to
keep
away
from
the
children
--
they
might
any
minute
*NL*
push
against
her
.
Then
he
had
once
more
to
hear
her
declare
that
she
was
*NL*
not
angry
with
him
for
going
away
for
two
days
,
and
to
beg
her
to
be
*NL*
sure
to
send
him
a
note
next
morning
by
a
servant
on
horseback
,
to
write
*NL*
him
,
if
it
were
but
two
words
only
,
to
let
him
know
that
all
was
well
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
distressed
,
as
she
always
was
,
at
parting
for
a
couple
of
days
*NL*
from
her
husband
,
but
when
she
saw
his
eager
figure
,
looking
big
and
*NL*
strong
in
his
shooting-boots
and
his
white
blouse
,
and
a
sort
of
*NL*
sportsman
elation
and
excitement
incomprehensible
to
her
,
she
forgot
her
*NL*
own
chagrin
for
the
sake
of
his
pleasure
,
and
said
good-bye
to
him
*NL*
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
gentlemen
!
''
he
said
,
running
out
onto
the
steps
.
``
Have
you
put
*NL*
the
lunch
in
?
Why
is
the
chestnut
on
the
right
?
Well
,
it
does
n't
matter
.
*NL*
Laska
,
down
;
go
and
lie
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
it
with
the
herd
of
oxen
,
''
he
said
to
the
herdsman
,
who
was
waiting
*NL*
for
him
at
the
steps
with
some
question
.
``
Excuse
me
,
here
comes
another
*NL*
villain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
jumped
out
of
the
wagonette
,
in
which
he
had
already
taken
his
*NL*
seat
,
to
meet
the
carpenter
,
who
came
towards
the
steps
with
a
rule
in
*NL*
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
come
to
the
counting
house
yesterday
,
and
now
you
're
*NL*
detaining
me
.
Well
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
your
honor
let
me
make
another
turning
?
It
's
only
three
steps
to
*NL*
add
.
And
we
make
it
just
fit
at
the
same
time
.
It
will
be
much
more
*NL*
convenient
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
listened
to
me
,
''
Levin
answered
with
annoyance
.
``
I
*NL*
said
:
Put
the
lines
and
then
fit
in
the
steps
.
Now
there
's
no
setting
it
*NL*
right
.
Do
as
I
told
you
,
and
make
a
new
staircase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
was
that
in
the
lodge
that
was
being
built
the
carpenter
had
*NL*
spoiled
the
staircase
,
fitting
it
together
without
calculating
the
space
*NL*
it
was
to
fill
,
so
that
the
steps
were
all
sloping
when
it
was
put
in
*NL*
place
.
Now
the
carpenter
wanted
,
keeping
the
same
staircase
,
to
add
*NL*
three
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
's
your
staircase
coming
out
with
its
three
steps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
upon
my
word
,
sir
,
''
the
carpenter
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile
.
*NL*
``
It
comes
out
right
at
the
very
spot
.
It
starts
,
so
to
speak
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
a
persuasive
gesture
;
``
it
comes
down
,
and
comes
down
,
and
comes
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
three
steps
will
add
to
the
length
too
...
where
is
it
to
come
*NL*
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
it
'll
start
from
the
bottom
and
go
up
and
go
up
,
and
*NL*
come
out
so
,
''
the
carpenter
said
obstinately
and
convincingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
reach
the
ceiling
and
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
Why
,
it
'll
go
up
,
and
up
,
and
come
out
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
took
out
a
ramrod
and
began
sketching
him
the
staircase
in
the
*NL*
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
do
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
your
honor
likes
,
''
said
the
carpenter
,
with
a
sudden
gleam
in
his
*NL*
eyes
,
obviously
understanding
the
thing
at
last
.
``
It
seems
it
'll
be
best
*NL*
to
make
a
new
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
do
it
as
you
're
told
,
''
Levin
shouted
,
seating
himself
in
*NL*
the
wagonette
.
``
Down
!
Hold
the
dogs
,
Philip
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
now
at
leaving
behind
all
his
family
and
household
cares
such
*NL*
an
eager
sense
of
joy
in
life
and
expectation
that
he
was
not
disposed
*NL*
to
talk
.
Besides
that
,
he
had
that
feeling
of
concentrated
excitement
*NL*
that
every
sportsman
experiences
as
he
approaches
the
scene
of
action
.
*NL*
If
he
had
anything
on
his
mind
at
that
moment
,
it
was
only
the
doubt
*NL*
whether
they
would
start
anything
in
the
Kolpensky
marsh
,
whether
Laska
*NL*
would
show
to
advantage
in
comparison
with
Krak
,
and
whether
he
would
*NL*
shoot
well
that
day
himself
.
Not
to
disgrace
himself
before
a
new
*NL*
spectator
--
not
to
be
outdone
by
Oblonsky
--
that
too
was
a
thought
that
*NL*
crossed
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oblonsky
was
feeling
the
same
,
and
he
too
was
not
talkative
.
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
kept
up
alone
a
ceaseless
flow
of
cheerful
chatter
.
As
he
*NL*
listened
to
him
now
,
Levin
felt
ashamed
to
think
how
unfair
he
had
been
*NL*
to
him
the
day
before
.
Vassenka
was
really
a
nice
fellow
,
simple
,
*NL*
good-hearted
,
and
very
good-humored
.
If
Levin
had
met
him
before
he
was
*NL*
married
,
he
would
have
made
friends
with
him
.
Levin
rather
disliked
his
*NL*
holiday
attitude
to
life
and
a
sort
of
free
and
easy
assumption
of
*NL*
elegance
.
It
was
as
though
he
assumed
a
high
degree
of
importance
in
*NL*
himself
that
could
not
be
disputed
,
because
he
had
long
nails
and
a
*NL*
stylish
cap
,
and
everything
else
to
correspond
;
but
this
could
be
*NL*
forgiven
for
the
sake
of
his
good
nature
and
good
breeding
.
Levin
liked
*NL*
him
for
his
good
education
,
for
speaking
French
and
English
with
such
an
*NL*
excellent
accent
,
and
for
being
a
man
of
his
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
was
extremely
delighted
with
the
left
horse
,
a
horse
of
the
Don
*NL*
Steppes
.
He
kept
praising
him
enthusiastically
.
``
How
fine
it
must
be
*NL*
galloping
over
the
steppes
on
a
steppe
horse
!
Eh
?
is
n't
it
?
''
he
said
.
He
*NL*
had
imagined
riding
on
a
steppe
horse
as
something
wild
and
romantic
,
*NL*
and
it
turned
out
nothing
of
the
sort
.
But
his
simplicity
,
particularly
*NL*
in
conjunction
with
his
good
looks
,
his
amiable
smile
,
and
the
grace
of
*NL*
his
movements
,
was
very
attractive
.
Either
because
his
nature
was
*NL*
sympathetic
to
Levin
,
or
because
Levin
was
trying
to
atone
for
his
sins
*NL*
of
the
previous
evening
by
seeing
nothing
but
what
was
good
in
him
,
*NL*
anyway
he
liked
his
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
they
had
driven
over
two
miles
from
home
,
Veslovsky
all
at
once
*NL*
felt
for
a
cigar
and
his
pocketbook
,
and
did
not
know
whether
he
had
*NL*
lost
them
or
left
them
on
the
table
.
In
the
pocketbook
there
were
*NL*
thirty-seven
pounds
,
and
so
the
matter
could
not
be
left
in
uncertainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
,
Levin
,
I
'll
gallop
home
on
that
left
trace-horse
.
*NL*
That
will
be
splendid
.
Eh
?
''
he
said
,
preparing
to
get
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
why
should
you
?
''
answered
Levin
,
calculating
that
Vassenka
could
*NL*
hardly
weigh
less
than
seventeen
stone
.
``
I
'll
send
the
coachman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
rode
back
on
the
trace-horse
,
and
Levin
himself
drove
the
*NL*
remaining
pair
.

*NL*
``
Well
,
now
what
's
our
plan
of
campaign
?
Tell
us
all
about
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
plan
is
this
.
Now
we
're
driving
to
Gvozdyov
.
In
Gvozdyov
there
's
a
*NL*
grouse
marsh
on
this
side
,
and
beyond
Gvozdyov
come
some
magnificent
*NL*
snipe
marshes
where
there
are
grouse
too
.
It
's
hot
now
,
and
we
'll
get
*NL*
there
--
it
's
fifteen
miles
or
so
--
towards
evening
and
have
some
evening
*NL*
shooting
;
we
'll
spend
the
night
there
and
go
on
tomorrow
to
the
bigger
*NL*
moors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
there
nothing
on
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
we
'll
reserve
ourselves
;
besides
it
's
hot
.
There
are
two
nice
*NL*
little
places
,
but
I
doubt
there
being
anything
to
shoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
would
himself
have
liked
to
go
into
these
little
places
,
but
they
*NL*
were
near
home
;
he
could
shoot
them
over
any
time
,
and
they
were
only
*NL*
little
places
--
there
would
hardly
be
room
for
three
to
shoot
.
And
so
,
*NL*
with
some
insincerity
,
he
said
that
he
doubted
there
being
anything
to
*NL*
shoot
.
When
they
reached
a
little
marsh
Levin
would
have
driven
by
,
but
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
the
experienced
eye
of
a
sportsman
,
at
once
*NL*
detected
reeds
visible
from
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
we
try
that
?
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
little
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Levin
,
do
,
please
!
how
delightful
!
''
Vassenka
Veslovsky
began
begging
,
*NL*
and
Levin
could
but
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
had
time
to
stop
,
the
dogs
had
flown
one
before
the
other
*NL*
into
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Krak
!
Laska
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dogs
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
wo
n't
be
room
for
three
.
I
'll
stay
here
,
''
said
Levin
,
hoping
they
*NL*
would
find
nothing
but
peewits
,
who
had
been
startled
by
the
dogs
,
and
*NL*
turning
over
in
their
flight
,
were
plaintively
wailing
over
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Come
along
,
Levin
,
let
's
go
together
!
''
Veslovsky
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
there
's
not
room
.
Laska
,
back
,
Laska
!
You
wo
n't
want
another
*NL*
dog
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
remained
with
the
wagonette
,
and
looked
enviously
at
the
*NL*
sportsmen
.
They
walked
right
across
the
marsh
.
Except
little
birds
and
*NL*
peewits
,
of
which
Vassenka
killed
one
,
there
was
nothing
in
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
see
now
that
it
was
not
that
I
grudged
the
marsh
,
''
said
*NL*
Levin
,
``
only
it
's
wasting
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
it
was
jolly
all
the
same
.
Did
you
see
us
?
''
said
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
clambering
awkwardly
into
the
wagonette
with
his
gun
and
his
*NL*
peewit
in
his
hands
.
``
How
splendidly
I
shot
this
bird
!
Did
n't
I
?
Well
,
*NL*
shall
we
soon
be
getting
to
the
real
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
started
off
suddenly
,
Levin
knocked
his
head
against
the
*NL*
stock
of
someone
's
gun
,
and
there
was
the
report
of
a
shot
.
The
gun
did
*NL*
actually
go
off
first
,
but
that
was
how
it
seemed
to
Levin
.
It
appeared
*NL*
that
Vassenka
Veslovsky
had
pulled
only
one
trigger
,
and
had
left
the
*NL*
other
hammer
still
cocked
.
The
charge
flew
into
the
ground
without
doing
*NL*
harm
to
anyone
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
shook
his
head
and
laughed
*NL*
reprovingly
at
Veslovsky
.
But
Levin
had
not
the
heart
to
reprove
him
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
any
reproach
would
have
seemed
to
be
called
forth
by
*NL*
the
danger
he
had
incurred
and
the
bump
that
had
come
up
on
Levin
's
*NL*
forehead
.
And
besides
,
Veslovsky
was
at
first
so
naively
distressed
,
and
*NL*
then
laughed
so
good-humoredly
and
infectiously
at
their
general
dismay
,
*NL*
that
one
could
not
but
laugh
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
second
marsh
,
which
was
fairly
large
,
and
would
*NL*
inevitably
take
some
time
to
shoot
over
,
Levin
tried
to
persuade
them
to
*NL*
pass
it
by
.
But
Veslovsky
again
overpersuaded
him
.
Again
,
as
the
marsh
*NL*
was
narrow
,
Levin
,
like
a
good
host
,
remained
with
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Krak
made
straight
for
some
clumps
of
sedge
.
Vassenka
Veslovsky
was
the
*NL*
first
to
run
after
the
dog
.
Before
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
time
to
come
*NL*
up
,
a
grouse
flew
out
.
Veslovsky
missed
it
and
it
flew
into
an
unmown
*NL*
meadow
.
This
grouse
was
left
for
Veslovsky
to
follow
up
.
Krak
found
it
*NL*
again
and
pointed
,
and
Veslovsky
shot
it
and
went
back
to
the
carriage
.
*NL*
``
Now
you
go
and
I
'll
stay
with
the
horses
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
begun
to
feel
the
pangs
of
a
sportsman
's
envy
.
He
handed
the
*NL*
reins
to
Veslovsky
and
walked
into
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laska
,
who
had
been
plaintively
whining
and
fretting
against
the
*NL*
injustice
of
her
treatment
,
flew
straight
ahead
to
a
hopeful
place
that
*NL*
Levin
knew
well
,
and
that
Krak
had
not
yet
come
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
stop
her
?
''
shouted
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
scare
them
,
''
answered
Levin
,
sympathizing
with
his
bitch
's
*NL*
pleasure
and
hurrying
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
familiar
breeding
places
there
was
*NL*
more
and
more
earnestness
in
Laska
's
exploration
.
A
little
marsh
bird
*NL*
did
not
divert
her
attention
for
more
than
an
instant
.
She
made
one
*NL*
circuit
round
the
clump
of
reeds
,
was
beginning
a
second
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
quivered
with
excitement
and
became
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Stiva
!
''
shouted
Levin
,
feeling
his
heart
beginning
to
beat
*NL*
more
violently
;
and
all
of
a
sudden
,
as
though
some
sort
of
shutter
had
*NL*
been
drawn
back
from
his
straining
ears
,
all
sounds
,
confused
but
loud
,
*NL*
began
to
beat
on
his
hearing
,
losing
all
sense
of
distance
.
He
heard
the
*NL*
steps
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
mistaking
them
for
the
tramp
of
the
horses
*NL*
in
the
distance
;
he
heard
the
brittle
sound
of
the
twigs
on
which
he
had
*NL*
trodden
,
taking
this
sound
for
the
flying
of
a
grouse
.
He
heard
too
,
not
*NL*
far
behind
him
,
a
splashing
in
the
water
,
which
he
could
not
explain
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Picking
his
steps
,
he
moved
up
to
the
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
grouse
but
a
snipe
flew
up
from
beside
the
dog
.
Levin
had
lifted
*NL*
his
gun
,
but
at
the
very
instant
when
he
was
taking
aim
,
the
sound
of
*NL*
splashing
grew
louder
,
came
closer
,
and
was
joined
with
the
sound
of
*NL*
Veslovsky
's
voice
,
shouting
something
with
strange
loudness
.
Levin
saw
*NL*
he
had
his
gun
pointed
behind
the
snipe
,
but
still
he
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
made
sure
he
had
missed
,
Levin
looked
round
and
saw
the
*NL*
horses
and
the
wagonette
not
on
the
road
but
in
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
eager
to
see
the
shooting
,
had
driven
into
the
marsh
,
and
got
*NL*
the
horses
stuck
in
the
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
the
fellow
!
''
Levin
said
to
himself
,
as
he
went
back
to
the
*NL*
carriage
that
had
sunk
in
the
mire
.
``
What
did
you
drive
in
for
?
''
he
said
*NL*
to
him
dryly
,
and
calling
the
coachman
,
he
began
pulling
the
horses
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
vexed
both
at
being
hindered
from
shooting
and
at
his
horses
*NL*
getting
stuck
in
the
mud
,
and
still
more
at
the
fact
that
neither
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
nor
Veslovsky
helped
him
and
the
coachman
to
unharness
the
*NL*
horses
and
get
them
out
,
since
neither
of
them
had
the
slightest
notion
*NL*
of
harnessing
.
Without
vouchsafing
a
syllable
in
reply
to
Vassenka
's
*NL*
protestations
that
it
had
been
quite
dry
there
,
Levin
worked
in
silence
*NL*
with
the
coachman
at
extricating
the
horses
.
But
then
,
as
he
got
warm
at
*NL*
the
work
and
saw
how
assiduously
Veslovsky
was
tugging
at
the
wagonette
*NL*
by
one
of
the
mud-guards
,
so
that
he
broke
it
indeed
,
Levin
blamed
*NL*
himself
for
having
under
the
influence
of
yesterday
's
feelings
been
too
*NL*
cold
to
Veslovsky
,
and
tried
to
be
particularly
genial
so
as
to
smooth
*NL*
over
his
chilliness
.
When
everything
had
been
put
right
,
and
the
*NL*
carriage
had
been
brought
back
to
the
road
,
Levin
had
the
lunch
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Bon
appetit
--
bonne
conscience
!
Ce
poulet
va
tomber
jusqu'au
fond
de
*NL*
mes
bottes
_
,
''
Vassenka
,
who
had
recovered
his
spirits
,
quoted
the
French
*NL*
saying
as
he
finished
his
second
chicken
.
``
Well
,
now
our
troubles
are
*NL*
over
,
now
everything
's
going
to
go
well
.
Only
,
to
atone
for
my
sins
,
I
'm
*NL*
bound
to
sit
on
the
box
.
That
's
so
?
eh
?
No
,
no
!
I
'll
be
your
Automedon
.
*NL*
You
shall
see
how
I
'll
get
you
along
,
''
he
answered
,
not
letting
go
the
*NL*
rein
,
when
Levin
begged
him
to
let
the
coachman
drive
.
``
No
,
I
must
atone
*NL*
for
my
sins
,
and
I
'm
very
comfortable
on
the
box
.
''
And
he
drove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
a
little
afraid
he
would
exhaust
the
horses
,
especially
the
*NL*
chestnut
,
whom
he
did
not
know
how
to
hold
in
;
but
unconsciously
he
fell
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
his
gaiety
and
listened
to
the
songs
he
sang
all
*NL*
the
way
on
the
box
,
or
the
descriptions
and
representations
he
gave
of
*NL*
driving
in
the
English
fashion
,
four-in-hand
;
and
it
was
in
the
very
*NL*
best
of
spirits
that
after
lunch
they
drove
to
the
Gvozdyov
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
drove
the
horses
so
smartly
that
they
reached
the
marsh
too
*NL*
early
,
while
it
was
still
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drew
near
this
more
important
marsh
,
the
chief
aim
of
their
*NL*
expedition
,
Levin
could
not
help
considering
how
he
could
get
rid
of
*NL*
Vassenka
and
be
free
in
his
movements
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
evidently
had
*NL*
the
same
desire
,
and
on
his
face
Levin
saw
the
look
of
anxiety
always
*NL*
present
in
a
true
sportsman
when
beginning
shooting
,
together
with
a
*NL*
certain
good-humored
slyness
peculiar
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
we
go
?
It
's
a
splendid
marsh
,
I
see
,
and
there
are
hawks
,
''
*NL*
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
pointing
to
two
great
birds
hovering
over
the
*NL*
reeds
.
``
Where
there
are
hawks
,
there
is
sure
to
be
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
''
said
Levin
,
pulling
up
his
boots
and
examining
the
*NL*
lock
of
his
gun
with
rather
a
gloomy
expression
,
``
do
you
see
those
*NL*
reeds
?
''
He
pointed
to
an
oasis
of
blackish
green
in
the
huge
half-mown
*NL*
wet
meadow
that
stretched
along
the
right
bank
of
the
river
.
``
The
marsh
*NL*
begins
here
,
straight
in
front
of
us
,
do
you
see
--
where
it
is
greener
?
*NL*
From
here
it
runs
to
the
right
where
the
horses
are
;
there
are
breeding
*NL*
places
there
,
and
grouse
,
and
all
round
those
reeds
as
far
as
that
*NL*
alder
,
and
right
up
to
the
mill
.
Over
there
,
do
you
see
,
where
the
pools
*NL*
are
?
That
's
the
best
place
.
There
I
once
shot
seventeen
snipe
.
We
'll
*NL*
separate
with
the
dogs
and
go
in
different
directions
,
and
then
meet
*NL*
over
there
at
the
mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
which
shall
go
to
left
and
which
to
right
?
''
asked
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
``
It
's
wider
to
the
right
;
you
two
go
that
way
and
I
'll
*NL*
take
the
left
,
''
he
said
with
apparent
carelessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
!
we
'll
make
the
bigger
bag
!
Yes
,
come
along
,
come
along
!
''
*NL*
Vassenka
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
could
do
nothing
but
agree
,
and
they
divided
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
entered
the
marsh
,
the
two
dogs
began
hunting
about
*NL*
together
and
made
towards
the
green
,
slime-covered
pool
.
Levin
knew
*NL*
Laska
's
method
,
wary
and
indefinite
;
he
knew
the
place
too
and
expected
*NL*
a
whole
covey
of
snipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Veslovsky
,
beside
me
,
walk
beside
me
!
''
he
said
in
a
faint
voice
to
his
*NL*
companion
splashing
in
the
water
behind
him
.
Levin
could
not
help
*NL*
feeling
an
interest
in
the
direction
his
gun
was
pointed
,
after
that
*NL*
casual
shot
near
the
Kolpensky
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
wo
n't
get
in
your
way
,
do
n't
trouble
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
could
not
help
troubling
,
and
recalled
Kitty
's
words
at
*NL*
parting
:
``
Mind
you
do
n't
shoot
one
another
.
''
The
dogs
came
nearer
and
*NL*
nearer
,
passed
each
other
,
each
pursuing
its
own
scent
.
The
expectation
*NL*
of
snipe
was
so
intense
that
to
Levin
the
squelching
sound
of
his
own
*NL*
heel
,
as
he
drew
it
up
out
of
the
mire
,
seemed
to
be
the
call
of
a
*NL*
snipe
,
and
he
clutched
and
pressed
the
lock
of
his
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bang
!
bang
!
''
sounded
almost
in
his
ear
.
Vassenka
had
fired
at
a
flock
*NL*
of
ducks
which
was
hovering
over
the
marsh
and
flying
at
that
moment
*NL*
towards
the
sportsmen
,
far
out
of
range
.
Before
Levin
had
time
to
look
*NL*
round
,
there
was
the
whir
of
one
snipe
,
another
,
a
third
,
and
some
eight
*NL*
more
rose
one
after
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
hit
one
at
the
very
moment
when
it
was
beginning
its
*NL*
zigzag
movements
,
and
the
snipe
fell
in
a
heap
into
the
mud
.
Oblonsky
*NL*
aimed
deliberately
at
another
,
still
flying
low
in
the
reeds
,
and
*NL*
together
with
the
report
of
the
shot
,
that
snipe
too
fell
,
and
it
could
*NL*
be
seen
fluttering
out
where
the
sedge
had
been
cut
,
its
unhurt
wing
*NL*
showing
white
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
not
so
lucky
:
he
aimed
at
his
first
bird
too
low
,
and
missed
;
*NL*
he
aimed
at
it
again
,
just
as
it
was
rising
,
but
at
that
instant
another
*NL*
snipe
flew
up
at
his
very
feet
,
distracting
him
so
that
he
missed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
loading
their
guns
,
another
snipe
rose
,
and
Veslovsky
,
*NL*
who
had
had
time
to
load
again
,
sent
two
charges
of
small-shot
into
the
*NL*
water
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
picked
up
his
snipe
,
and
with
sparkling
eyes
*NL*
looked
at
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
let
us
separate
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
limping
on
*NL*
his
left
foot
,
holding
his
gun
in
readiness
and
whistling
to
his
dog
,
he
*NL*
walked
off
in
one
direction
.
Levin
and
Veslovsky
walked
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
always
happened
with
Levin
that
when
his
first
shots
were
a
failure
*NL*
he
got
hot
and
out
of
temper
,
and
shot
badly
the
whole
day
.
So
it
was
*NL*
that
day
.
The
snipe
showed
themselves
in
numbers
.
They
kept
flying
up
*NL*
from
just
under
the
dogs
,
from
under
the
sportsmen
's
legs
,
and
Levin
*NL*
might
have
retrieved
his
ill
luck
.
But
the
more
he
shot
,
the
more
he
*NL*
felt
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
Veslovsky
,
who
kept
popping
away
merrily
*NL*
and
indiscriminately
,
killing
nothing
,
and
not
in
the
slightest
abashed
*NL*
by
his
ill
success
.
Levin
,
in
feverish
haste
,
could
not
restrain
*NL*
himself
,
got
more
and
more
out
of
temper
,
and
ended
by
shooting
almost
*NL*
without
a
hope
of
hitting
.
Laska
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
understand
this
.
She
*NL*
began
looking
more
languidly
,
and
gazed
back
at
the
sportsmen
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
with
perplexity
or
reproach
in
her
eyes
.
Shots
followed
shots
in
*NL*
rapid
succession
.
The
smoke
of
the
powder
hung
about
the
sportsmen
,
*NL*
while
in
the
great
roomy
net
of
the
game
bag
there
were
only
three
light
*NL*
little
snipe
.
And
of
these
one
had
been
killed
by
Veslovsky
alone
,
and
*NL*
one
by
both
of
them
together
.
Meanwhile
from
the
other
side
of
the
marsh
*NL*
came
the
sound
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
shots
,
not
frequent
,
but
,
as
*NL*
Levin
fancied
,
well-directed
,
for
almost
after
each
they
heard
``
Krak
,
*NL*
Krak
,
_
apporte
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
excited
Levin
still
more
.
The
snipe
were
floating
continually
in
*NL*
the
air
over
the
reeds
.
Their
whirring
wings
close
to
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
their
harsh
cries
high
in
the
air
,
could
be
heard
on
all
sides
;
the
*NL*
snipe
that
had
risen
first
and
flown
up
into
the
air
,
settled
again
*NL*
before
the
sportsmen
.
Instead
of
two
hawks
there
were
now
dozens
of
them
*NL*
hovering
with
shrill
cries
over
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
through
the
larger
half
of
the
marsh
,
Levin
and
Veslovsky
*NL*
reached
the
place
where
the
peasants
'
mowing-grass
was
divided
into
long
*NL*
strips
reaching
to
the
reeds
,
marked
off
in
one
place
by
the
trampled
*NL*
grass
,
in
another
by
a
path
mown
through
it
.
Half
of
these
strips
had
*NL*
already
been
mown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
was
not
so
much
hope
of
finding
birds
in
the
uncut
part
as
*NL*
the
cut
part
,
Levin
had
promised
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
to
meet
him
,
and
so
*NL*
he
walked
on
with
his
companion
through
the
cut
and
uncut
patches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
sportsmen
!
''
shouted
one
of
a
group
of
peasants
,
sitting
on
an
*NL*
unharnessed
cart
;
``
come
and
have
some
lunch
with
us
!
Have
a
drop
of
*NL*
wine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
it
's
all
right
!
''
shouted
a
good-humored-looking
bearded
*NL*
peasant
with
a
red
face
,
showing
his
white
teeth
in
a
grin
,
and
holding
*NL*
up
a
greenish
bottle
that
flashed
in
the
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Qu'est
-
ce
qu'ils
disent
_
?
''
asked
Veslovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
invite
you
to
have
some
vodka
.
Most
likely
they
've
been
dividing
*NL*
the
meadow
into
lots
.
I
should
have
some
,
''
said
Levin
,
not
without
some
*NL*
guile
,
hoping
Veslovsky
would
be
tempted
by
the
vodka
,
and
would
go
away
*NL*
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

they
're
merry-making

Really

should
join
them

``
You

'll
find
the

''
cried
Levin
,
and
*NL*
looking
round
he
perceived
with
satisfaction
that
Veslovsky
,
bent
and
*NL*
stumbling
with
weariness
,
holding
his
gun
out
at
arm
's
length
,
was
*NL*
making
his
way
out
of
the
marsh
towards
the
peasants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
too
!
''
the
peasants
shouted
to
Levin
.
``
Never
fear
!
You
taste
*NL*
our
cake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
drink
a
little
vodka
and
to
eat
some
*NL*
bread
.
He
was
exhausted
,
and
felt
it
a
great
effort
to
drag
his
*NL*
staggering
legs
out
of
the
mire
,
and
for
a
minute
he
hesitated
.
But
*NL*
Laska
was
setting
.
And
immediately
all
his
weariness
vanished
,
and
he
*NL*
walked
lightly
through
the
swamp
towards
the
dog
.
A
snipe
flew
up
at
his
*NL*
feet
;
he
fired
and
killed
it
.
Laska
still
pointed
.
--
``
Fetch
it
!
''
Another
*NL*
bird
flew
up
close
to
the
dog
.
Levin
fired
.
But
it
was
an
unlucky
day
*NL*
for
him
;
he
missed
it
,
and
when
he
went
to
look
for
the
one
he
had
shot
,
*NL*
he
could
not
find
that
either
.
He
wandered
all
about
the
reeds
,
but
*NL*
Laska
did
not
believe
he
had
shot
it
,
and
when
he
sent
her
to
find
it
,
*NL*
she
pretended
to
hunt
for
it
,
but
did
not
really
.
And
in
the
absence
of
*NL*
Vassenka
,
on
whom
Levin
threw
the
blame
of
his
failure
,
things
went
no
*NL*
better
.
There
were
plenty
of
snipe
still
,
but
Levin
made
one
miss
after
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
were
still
hot
;
his
clothes
,
soaked
through
*NL*
with
perspiration
,
stuck
to
his
body
;
his
left
boot
full
of
water
*NL*
weighed
heavily
on
his
leg
and
squeaked
at
every
step
;
the
sweat
ran
in
*NL*
drops
down
his
powder-grimed
face
,
his
mouth
was
full
of
the
bitter
*NL*
taste
,
his
nose
of
the
smell
of
powder
and
stagnant
water
,
his
ears
were
*NL*
ringing
with
the
incessant
whir
of
the
snipe
;
he
could
not
touch
the
*NL*
stock
of
his
gun
,
it
was
so
hot
;
his
heart
beat
with
short
,
rapid
*NL*
throbs
;
his
hands
shook
with
excitement
,
and
his
weary
legs
stumbled
and
*NL*
staggered
over
the
hillocks
and
in
the
swamp
,
but
still
he
walked
on
and
*NL*
still
he
shot
.
At
last
,
after
a
disgraceful
miss
,
he
flung
his
gun
and
*NL*
his
hat
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
must
control
myself
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
Picking
up
his
gun
and
*NL*
his
hat
,
he
called
Laska
,
and
went
out
of
the
swamp
.
When
he
got
on
to
*NL*
dry
ground
he
sat
down
,
pulled
off
his
boot
and
emptied
it
,
then
walked
*NL*
to
the
marsh
,
drank
some
stagnant-tasting
water
,
moistened
his
burning
*NL*
hot
gun
,
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
.
Feeling
refreshed
,
he
went
back
*NL*
to
the
spot
where
a
snipe
had
settled
,
firmly
resolved
to
keep
cool
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
be
calm
,
but
it
was
the
same
again
.
His
finger
pressed
the
*NL*
cock
before
he
had
taken
a
good
aim
at
the
bird
.
It
got
worse
and
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
only
five
birds
in
his
game-bag
when
he
walked
out
of
the
marsh
*NL*
towards
the
alders
where
he
was
to
rejoin
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
caught
sight
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
he
saw
his
dog
.
Krak
*NL*
darted
out
from
behind
the
twisted
root
of
an
alder
,
black
all
over
with
*NL*
the
stinking
mire
of
the
marsh
,
and
with
the
air
of
a
conqueror
sniffed
*NL*
at
Laska
.
Behind
Krak
there
came
into
view
in
the
shade
of
the
alder
*NL*
tree
the
shapely
figure
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
He
came
to
meet
him
,
red
*NL*
and
perspiring
,
with
unbuttoned
neckband
,
still
limping
in
the
same
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
You
have
been
popping
away
!
''
he
said
,
smiling
good-humoredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
got
on
?
''
queried
Levin
.
But
there
was
no
need
to
ask
,
for
*NL*
he
had
already
seen
the
full
game
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pretty
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fourteen
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
splendid
marsh
!
I
've
no
doubt
Veslovsky
got
in
your
way
.
It
's
awkward
*NL*
too
,
shooting
with
one
dog
,

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
to
soften
his
*NL*
triumph
.

*NL*
When
Levin
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
reached
the
peasant
's
hut
where
Levin
*NL*
always
used
to
stay
,
Veslovsky
was
already
there
.
He
was
sitting
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
hut
,
clinging
with
both
hands
to
the
bench
from
which
he
*NL*
was
being
pulled
by
a
soldier
,
the
brother
of
the
peasant
's
wife
,
who
*NL*
was
helping
him
off
with
his
miry
boots
.
Veslovsky
was
laughing
his
*NL*
infectious
,
good-humored
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
just
come
.
_
Ils

.
Just
fancy
,
they
gave
me
*NL*
drink
,
fed
me
!
Such
bread
,
it
was
exquisite
!
_
Delicieux
!
_
And
the
vodka
,
*NL*
I
never
tasted
any
better
.
And
they
would
not
take
a
penny
for
anything
.
*NL*
And
they
kept
saying
:
`
Excuse
our
homely
ways
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
they
take
anything
for
?
They
were
entertaining
you
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
.
Do
you
suppose
they
keep
vodka
for
sale
?
''
said
the
soldier
,
*NL*
succeeding
at
last
in
pulling
the
soaked
boot
off
the
blackened
*NL*
stocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
dirtiness
of
the
hut
,
which
was
all
muddied
by
their
*NL*
boots
and
the
filthy
dogs
licking
themselves
clean
,
and
the
smell
of
*NL*
marsh
mud
and
powder
that
filled
the
room
,
and
the
absence
of
knives
and
*NL*
forks
,
the
party
drank
their
tea
and
ate
their
supper
with
a
relish
only
*NL*
known
to
sportsmen
.
Washed
and
clean
,
they
went
into
a
hay-barn
swept
*NL*
ready
for
them
,
where
the
coachman
had
been
making
up
beds
for
the
*NL*
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
dusk
,
not
one
of
them
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
wavering
among
reminiscences
and
anecdotes
of
guns
,
of
dogs
,
and
*NL*
of
former
shooting
parties
,
the
conversation
rested
on
a
topic
that
*NL*
interested
all
of
them
.
After
Vassenka
had
several
times
over
expressed
*NL*
his
appreciation
of
this
delightful
sleeping
place
among
the
fragrant
*NL*
hay
,
this
delightful
broken
cart
-LRB-
he
supposed
it
to
be
broken
because
*NL*
the
shafts
had
been
taken
out
-RRB-
,
of
the
good
nature
of
the
peasants
that
*NL*
had
treated
him
to
vodka
,
of
the
dogs
who
lay
at
the
feet
of
their
*NL*
respective
masters
,
Oblonsky
began
telling
them
of
a
delightful
shooting
*NL*
party
at
Malthus
's
,
where
he
had
stayed
the
previous
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Malthus
was
a
well-known
capitalist
,
who
had
made
his
money
by
*NL*
speculation
in
railway
shares
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
described
what
grouse
*NL*
moors
this
Malthus
had
bought
in
the
Tver
province
,
and
how
they
were
*NL*
preserved
,
and
of
the
carriages
and
dogcarts
in
which
the
shooting
party
*NL*
had
been
driven
,
and
the
luncheon
pavilion
that
had
been
rigged
up
at
*NL*
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
''
said
Levin
,
sitting
up
in
the
hay
;
``
how
is
it
*NL*
such
people
do
n't
disgust
you
?
I
can
understand
a
lunch
with
Lafitte
is
*NL*
all
very
pleasant
,
but
do
n't
you
dislike
just
that
very
sumptuousness
?
*NL*
All
these
people
,
just
like
our
spirit
monopolists
in
old
days
,
get
*NL*
their
money
in
a
way
that
gains
them
the
contempt
of
everyone
.
They
*NL*
do
n't
care
for
their
contempt
,
and
then
they
use
their
dishonest
gains
*NL*
to
buy
off
the
contempt
they
have
deserved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
true
!
''
chimed
in
Vassenka
Veslovsky
.
``
Perfectly
!
Oblonsky
,
of
*NL*
course
,
goes
out
of
_
bonhomie
_
,
but
other
people
say
:
`
Well
,
Oblonsky
*NL*
stays
with
them
.
'
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
''
Levin
could
hear
that
Oblonsky
was
smiling
as
he
*NL*
spoke
.
``
I
simply
do
n't
consider
him
more
dishonest
than
any
other
*NL*
wealthy
merchant
or
nobleman
.
They
've
all
made
their
money
alike
--
by
*NL*
their
work
and
their
intelligence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
what
work
?
Do
you
call
it
work
to
get
hold
of
concessions
and
*NL*
speculate
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
's
work

Work
in
this
sense
,
that
if
it
were
not
for
him
*NL*
and
others
like
him
,
there
would
have
been
no
railways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
not
work
,
like
the
work
of
a
peasant
or
a
learned
*NL*
profession

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granted
,
but
it
's
work
in
the
sense
that
his
activity
produces
a
*NL*
result

the

But
of
course
you
think
the
railways
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
's
another
question
;
I
am
prepared
to
admit
that
they
're
*NL*
useful

all
profit
that
is
out
of
proportion

expended

dishonest

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
is
to
define
what
is
proportionate
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Making
profit
by
dishonest
means
,
by
trickery

''
said
Levin
,
conscious
*NL*
that
he
could
not
draw
a
distinct
line
between
honesty
and
dishonesty
.
*NL*
``
Such
as
banking
,
for
instance
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
It
's
an
evil

the
amassing

the

No

Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
called
to
his
dog
,
who
was
scratching
and
turning
over
all
*NL*
the
hay
.
He
was
obviously
convinced
of
the
correctness
of
his
position
,
*NL*
and
so
talked
serenely
and
without
haste
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

your
receiving

hard

up

on

for

reflecting

Stepan

Arkadyevitch
,
intentionally
,
as
it
seemed

provoking
Levin

*NL*
*NL*
There
had
arisen
of
late
something
like
a
secret
antagonism
between
the
*NL*
two
brothers-in-law
;
as
though
,
since
they
had
married
sisters
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
rivalry
had
sprung
up
between
them
as
to
which
was
ordering
his
life
*NL*
best
,
and
now
this
hostility
showed
itself
in
the
conversation
,
as
it
*NL*
began
to
take
a
personal
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
give
it
away

no

from

wanted
to

I
could
not

answered
Levin

up

I
have
duties
both
to
the
land
and
to
my
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
excuse
me
,
but
if
you
consider
this
inequality
is
unjust
,
why
is
it
*NL*
you
do
n't
act
accordingly
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
act
negatively
on
that
idea
,
so
far
as
not
trying
to
*NL*
increase
the
difference
of
position
existing
between
him
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
excuse
me
,
that
's
a
paradox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
something
of
a
sophistry
about
that
,
''
Veslovsky
agreed
.
*NL*
``
Ah
!
our
host
;
so
you
're
not
asleep
yet
?
''
he
said
to
the
peasant
who
*NL*
came
into
the
barn
,
opening
the
creaking
door
.
``
How
is
it
you
're
not
*NL*
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
how
's
one
to
sleep
!
I
thought
our
gentlemen
would
be
asleep
,
but
I
*NL*
heard
them
chattering
.
I
want
to
get
a
hook
from
here
.
She
wo
n't
bite
?
''
*NL*
he
added
,
stepping
cautiously
with
his
bare
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
out
for
the
night
with
the
beasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
a
night
!
''
said
Veslovsky
,
looking
out
at
the
edge
of
the
hut
*NL*
and
the
unharnessed
wagonette
that
could
be
seen
in
the
faint
light
of
*NL*
the
evening
glow
in
the
great
frame
of
the
open
doors
.
``
But
listen
,
*NL*
there
are
women
's
voices
singing
,
and
,
on
my
word
,
not
badly
too
.
Who
's
*NL*
that
singing
,
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
maids
from
hard
by
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

go

have

Oblonsky

*NL*

along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
one
could
only
do
both
,
lie
here
and
go
,
''
answered
Oblonsky
,
*NL*
stretching
.
``
It
's
capital
lying
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
shall
go
by
myself
,
''
said
Veslovsky
,
getting
up
eagerly
,
and
*NL*
putting
on
his
shoes
and
stockings
.
``
Good-bye
,
gentlemen
.
If
it
's
fun
,
*NL*
I
'll
fetch
you
.
You
've
treated
me
to
some
good
sport
,
and
I
wo
n't
forget
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
really
is
a
capital
fellow
,
is
n't
he
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
when
Veslovsky
had
gone
out
and
the
peasant
had
closed
the
door
after
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
capital
,
''
answered
Levin
,
still
thinking
of
the
subject
of
their
*NL*
conversation
just
before
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
clearly
expressed
*NL*
his
thoughts
and
feelings
to
the
best
of
his
capacity
,
and
yet
both
of
*NL*
them
,
straightforward
men
and
not
fools
,
had
said
with
one
voice
that
he
*NL*
was
comforting
himself
with
sophistries
.
This
disconcerted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
this
,
my
dear
boy
.
One
must
do
one
of
two
things
:
either
*NL*
admit
that
the
existing
order
of
society
is
just
,
and
then
stick
up
for
*NL*
one
's
rights
in
it
;
or
acknowledge
that
you
are
enjoying
unjust
*NL*
privileges
,
as
I
do
,
and
then
enjoy
them
and
be
satisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
if
it
were
unjust
,
you
could
not
enjoy
these
advantages
and
be
*NL*
satisfied
--
at
least
I
could
not
.
The
great
thing
for
me
is
to
feel
that
*NL*
I
'm
not
to
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
why
not
go
after
all
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
evidently
weary
of
the
strain
of
thought
.
``
We
sha
n't
go
to
sleep
,
you
*NL*
know
.
Come
,
let
's
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
answer
.
What
they
had
said
in
the
conversation
,
that
he
*NL*
acted
justly
only
in
a
negative
sense
,
absorbed
his
thoughts
.
``
Can
it
be
*NL*
that
it
's
only
possible
to
be
just
negatively
?
''
he
was
asking
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strong
the
smell
of
the
fresh
hay
is
,
though
,
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
getting
up
.
``
There
's
not
a
chance
of
sleeping

Vassenka
*NL*
has
been
getting
up
some
fun
there
.
Do
you
hear
the
laughing
and
his
*NL*
voice
?
Had
n't
we
better
go
?
Come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
coming
,
''
answered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
that
's
not
a
matter
of
principle
too
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
smiling
,
as
he
felt
about
in
the
dark
for
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
matter
of
principle

but
why
should
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
know
you
are
preparing
trouble
for
yourself

''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
finding
his
cap
and
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
I
do
n't
see
the
line
you
've
taken
up
with
your
wife
?
I
*NL*
heard
how
it
's
a
question
of
the
greatest
consequence
,
whether
or
not
*NL*
you
're
to
be
away
for
a
couple
of
days
'
shooting
.
That
's
all
very
well
*NL*
as
an
idyllic
episode
,
but
for
your
whole
life
that
wo
n't
answer
.
A
man
*NL*
must
be
independent
;
he
has
his
masculine
interests
.
A
man
has
to
be
*NL*
manly
,
''
said
Oblonsky
,
opening
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
To
go
running
after
servant
girls
?

said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
if
it
amuses
him

It
wo
n't
do
*NL*
my
wife
any
harm
,
and
it
'll
amuse
me
.
The
great
thing
is
to
respect
the
*NL*
sanctity
of
the
home
.
There
should
be
nothing
in
the
home
.
But
do
n't
tie
*NL*
your
own
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
,
''
said
Levin
dryly
,
and
he
turned
on
his
side
.
``
Tomorrow
,
*NL*
early
,
I
want
to
go
shooting
,
and
I
wo

anyone

set
off
*NL*
at
daybreak

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Messieurs

they
heard
the
voice
of
Veslovsky
coming
*NL*
back
.
''
_
Charmante
!
_
I
've
made
such
a
discovery

_
Charmante

a

*NL*
Gretchen
,
and
I
've
already
made
friends
with
her

Really

exceedingly
*NL*
pretty

''
he
declared
in
a
tone
of
approval
,
as
though
she
had
been
made
*NL*
pretty
entirely
on
his
account
,
and
he
was
expressing
his
satisfaction
*NL*
with
the
entertainment
that
had
been
provided
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
pretended
to
be
asleep
,
while
Oblonsky
,
putting
on
his
slippers
,
*NL*
and
lighting
a
cigar
,
walked
out
of
the
barn
,
and
soon
their
voices
were
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
while
Levin
could
not
get
to
sleep
.
He
heard
the
horses
*NL*
munching
hay
,
then
he
heard
the
peasant
and
his
elder
boy
getting
ready
*NL*
for
the
night
,
and
going
off
for
the
night
watch
with
the
beasts
,
then
*NL*
he
heard
the
soldier
arranging
his
bed
on
the
other
side
of
the
barn
,
*NL*
with
his
nephew
,
the
younger
son
of
their
peasant
host
.
He
heard
the
boy
*NL*
in
his
shrill
little
voice
telling
his
uncle
what
he
thought
about
the
*NL*
dogs
,
who
seemed
to
him
huge
and
terrible
creatures
,
and
asking
what
the
*NL*
dogs
were
going
to
hunt
next
day
,
and
the
soldier
in
a
husky
,
sleepy
*NL*
voice
,
telling
him
the
sportsmen
were
going
in
the
morning
to
the
marsh
,
*NL*
and
would
shoot
with
their
guns
;
and
then
,
to
check
the
boy
's
questions
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
Go
to
sleep
,
Vaska
;
go
to
sleep
,
or
you
'll
catch
it
,
''
and
soon
*NL*
after
he
began
snoring
himself
,
and
everything
was
still
.
He
could
only
*NL*
hear
the
snort
of
the
horses
,
and
the
guttural
cry
of
a
snipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
only
negative
?
''
he
repeated
to
himself
.
``
Well
,
what
of
it
?
*NL*
It
's
not
my
fault
.
''
And
he
began
thinking
about
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tomorrow
I
'll
go
out
early
,
and
I
'll
make
a
point
of
keeping
cool
.
*NL*
There
are
lots
of
snipe
;
and
there
are
grouse
too
.
When
I
come
back
*NL*
there
'll
be
the
note
from
Kitty
.
Yes
,
Stiva
may
be
right
,
I
'm
not
manly
*NL*
with
her
,
I
'm
tied
to
her
apron-strings
...
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
!
*NL*
Negative
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
asleep
,
he
heard
the
laughter
and
mirthful
talk
of
Veslovsky
and
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
For
an
instant
he
opened
his
eyes
:
the
moon
was
up
,
*NL*
and
in
the
open
doorway
,
brightly
lighted
up
by
the
moonlight
,
they
were
*NL*
standing
talking
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
saying
something
of
the
*NL*
freshness
of
one
girl
,
comparing
her
to
a
freshly
peeled
nut
,
and
*NL*
Veslovsky
with
his
infectious
laugh
was
repeating
some
words
,
probably
*NL*
said
to
him
by
a
peasant
:
``
Ah
,
you
do
your
best
to
get
round
her
!
''
*NL*
Levin
,
half
asleep
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
tomorrow
before
daylight
!
''
and
fell
asleep
.

*NL*
*NL*
Waking
up
at
earliest
dawn
,
Levin
tried
to
wake
his
companions
.
*NL*
Vassenka
,
lying
on
his
stomach
,
with
one
leg
in
a
stocking
thrust
out
,
*NL*
was
sleeping
so
soundly
that
he
could
elicit
no
response
.
Oblonsky
,
half
*NL*
asleep
,
declined
to
get
up
so
early
.
Even
Laska
,
who
was
asleep
,
curled
*NL*
up
in
the
hay
,
got
up
unwillingly
,
and
lazily
stretched
out
and
*NL*
straightened
her
hind
legs
one
after
the
other
.
Getting
on
his
boots
and
*NL*
stockings
,
taking
his
gun
,
and
carefully
opening
the
creaking
door
of
*NL*
the
barn
,
Levin
went
out
into
the
road
.
The
coachmen
were
sleeping
in
*NL*
their
carriages
,
the
horses
were
dozing
.
Only
one
was
lazily
eating
*NL*
oats
,
dipping
its
nose
into
the
manger
.
It
was
still
gray
out-of-doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
up
so
early
,
my
dear
?
''
the
old
woman
,
their
hostess
,
said
,
*NL*
coming
out
of
the
hut
and
addressing
him
affectionately
as
an
old
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
shooting
,
granny
.
Do
I
go
this
way
to
the
marsh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
out
at
the
back
;
by
our
threshing
floor
,
my
dear
,
and
hemp
*NL*
patches
;
there
's
a
little
footpath
.
''
Stepping
carefully
with
her
*NL*
sunburnt
,
bare
feet
,
the
old
woman
conducted
Levin
,
and
moved
back
the
*NL*
fence
for
him
by
the
threshing
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
on
and
you
'll
come
to
the
marsh
.
Our
lads
drove
the
cattle
*NL*
there
yesterday
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laska
ran
eagerly
forward
along
the
little
path
.
Levin
followed
her
with
*NL*
a
light
,
rapid
step
,
continually
looking
at
the
sky
.
He
hoped
the
sun
*NL*
would
not
be
up
before
he
reached
the
marsh
.
But
the
sun
did
not
delay
.
*NL*
The
moon
,
which
had
been
bright
when
he
went
out
,
by
now
shone
only
like
*NL*
a
crescent
of
quicksilver
.
The
pink
flush
of
dawn
,
which
one
could
not
*NL*
help
seeing
before
,
now
had
to
be
sought
to
be
discerned
at
all
.
What
*NL*
were
before
undefined
,
vague
blurs
in
the
distant
countryside
could
now
*NL*
be
distinctly
seen
.
They
were
sheaves
of
rye
.
The
dew
,
not
visible
till
*NL*
the
sun
was
up
,
wetted
Levin
's
legs
and
his
blouse
above
his
belt
in
the
*NL*
high
growing
,
fragrant
hemp
patch
,
from
which
the
pollen
had
already
*NL*
fallen
out
.
In
the
transparent
stillness
of
morning
the
smallest
sounds
*NL*
were
audible
.
A
bee
flew
by
Levin
's
ear
with
the
whizzing
sound
of
a
*NL*
bullet
.
He
looked
carefully
,
and
saw
a
second
and
a
third
.
They
were
all
*NL*
flying
from
the
beehives
behind
the
hedge
,
and
they
disappeared
over
the
*NL*
hemp
patch
in
the
direction
of
the
marsh
.
The
path
led
straight
to
the
*NL*
marsh
.
The
marsh
could
be
recognized
by
the
mist
which
rose
from
it
,
*NL*
thicker
in
one
place
and
thinner
in
another
,
so
that
the
reeds
and
*NL*
willow
bushes
swayed
like
islands
in
this
mist
.
At
the
edge
of
the
marsh
*NL*
and
the
road
,
peasant
boys
and
men
,
who
had
been
herding
for
the
night
,
*NL*
were
lying
,
and
in
the
dawn
all
were
asleep
under
their
coats
.
Not
far
*NL*
from
them
were
three
hobbled
horses
.
One
of
them
clanked
a
chain
.
Laska
*NL*
walked
beside
her
master
,
pressing
a
little
forward
and
looking
round
.
*NL*
Passing
the
sleeping
peasants
and
reaching
the
first
reeds
,
Levin
*NL*
examined
his
pistols
and
let
his
dog
off
.
One
of
the
horses
,
a
sleek
,
*NL*
dark-brown
three-year-old
,
seeing
the
dog
,
started
away
,
switched
its
*NL*
tail
and
snorted
.
The
other
horses
too
were
frightened
,
and
splashing
*NL*
through
the
water
with
their
hobbled
legs
,
and
drawing
their
hoofs
out
*NL*
of
the
thick
mud
with
a
squelching
sound
,
they
bounded
out
of
the
marsh
.
*NL*
Laska
stopped
,
looking
ironically
at
the
horses
and
inquiringly
at
*NL*
Levin
.
Levin
patted
Laska
,
and
whistled
as
a
sign
that
she
might
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laska
ran
joyfully
and
anxiously
through
the
slush
that
swayed
under
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Running
into
the
marsh
among
the
familiar
scents
of
roots
,
marsh
plants
,
*NL*
and
slime
,
and
the
extraneous
smell
of
horse
dung
,
Laska
detected
at
*NL*
once
a
smell
that
pervaded
the
whole
marsh
,
the
scent
of
that
*NL*
strong-smelling
bird
that
always
excited
her
more
than
any
other
.
Here
*NL*
and
there
among
the
moss
and
marsh
plants
this
scent
was
very
strong
,
*NL*
but
it
was
impossible
to
determine
in
which
direction
it
grew
stronger
*NL*
or
fainter
.
To
find
the
direction
,
she
had
to
go
farther
away
from
the
*NL*
wind
.
Not
feeling
the
motion
of
her
legs
,
Laska
bounded
with
a
stiff
*NL*
gallop
,
so
that
at
each
bound
she
could
stop
short
,
to
the
right
,
away
*NL*
from
the
wind
that
blew
from
the
east
before
sunrise
,
and
turned
facing
*NL*
the
wind
.
Sniffing
in
the
air
with
dilated
nostrils
,
she
felt
at
once
*NL*
that
not
their
tracks
only
but
they
themselves
were
here
before
her
,
and
*NL*
not
one
,
but
many
.
Laska
slackened
her
speed
.
They
were
here
,
but
where
*NL*
precisely
she
could
not
yet
determine
.
To
find
the
very
spot
,
she
began
*NL*
to
make
a
circle
,
when
suddenly
her
master
's
voice
drew
her
off
.
``
Laska
!
*NL*
here
?
''
he
asked
,
pointing
her
to
a
different
direction
.
She
stopped
,
*NL*
asking
him
if
she
had
better
not
go
on
doing
as
she
had
begun
.
But
he
*NL*
repeated
his
command
in
an
angry
voice
,
pointing
to
a
spot
covered
with
*NL*
water
,
where
there
could
not
be
anything
.
She
obeyed
him
,
pretending
she
*NL*
was
looking
,
so
as
to
please
him
,
went
round
it
,
and
went
back
to
her
*NL*
former
position
,
and
was
at
once
aware
of
the
scent
again
.
Now
when
he
*NL*
was
not
hindering
her
,
she
knew
what
to
do
,
and
without
looking
at
what
*NL*
was
under
her
feet
,
and
to
her
vexation
stumbling
over
a
high
stump
into
*NL*
the
water
,
but
righting
herself
with
her
strong
,
supple
legs
,
she
began
*NL*
making
the
circle
which
was
to
make
all
clear
to
her
.
The
scent
of
them
*NL*
reached
her
,
stronger
and
stronger
,
and
more
and
more
defined
,
and
all
*NL*
at
once
it
became
perfectly
clear
to
her
that
one
of
them
was
here
,
*NL*
behind
this
tuft
of
reeds
,
five
paces
in
front
of
her
;
she
stopped
,
and
*NL*
her
whole
body
was
still
and
rigid
.
On
her
short
legs
she
could
see
*NL*
nothing
in
front
of
her
,
but
by
the
scent
she
knew
it
was
sitting
not
*NL*
more
than
five
paces
off
.
She
stood
still
,
feeling
more
and
more
*NL*
conscious
of
it
,
and
enjoying
it
in
anticipation
.
Her
tail
was
stretched
*NL*
straight
and
tense
,
and
only
wagging
at
the
extreme
end
.
Her
mouth
was
*NL*
slightly
open
,
her
ears
raised
.
One
ear
had
been
turned
wrong
side
out
*NL*
as
she
ran
up
,
and
she
breathed
heavily
but
warily
,
and
still
more
*NL*
warily
looked
round
,
but
more
with
her
eyes
than
her
head
,
to
her
*NL*
master
.
He
was
coming
along
with
the
face
she
knew
so
well
,
though
the
*NL*
eyes
were
always
terrible
to
her
.
He
stumbled
over
the
stump
as
he
came
,
*NL*
and
moved
,
as
she
thought
,
extraordinarily
slowly
.
She
thought
he
came
*NL*
slowly
,
but
he
was
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noticing
Laska
's
special
attitude
as
she
crouched
on
the
ground
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
scratching
big
prints
with
her
hind
paws
,
and
with
her
mouth
*NL*
slightly
open
,
Levin
knew
she
was
pointing
at
grouse
,
and
with
an
inward
*NL*
prayer
for
luck
,
especially
with
the
first
bird
,
he
ran
up
to
her
.
*NL*
Coming
quite
close
up
to
her
,
he
could
from
his
height
look
beyond
her
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
with
his
eyes
what
she
was
seeing
with
her
nose
.
In
a
space
*NL*
between
two
little
thickets
,
at
a
couple
of
yards
'
distance
,
he
could
*NL*
see
a
grouse
.
Turning
its
head
,
it
was
listening
.
Then
lightly
preening
*NL*
and
folding
its
wings
,
it
disappeared
round
a
corner
with
a
clumsy
wag
*NL*
of
its
tail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
it
,
fetch
it
!
''
shouted
Levin
,
giving
Laska
a
shove
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
go
,
''
thought
Laska
.
``
Where
am
I
to
go
?
From
here
I
feel
*NL*
them
,
but
if
I
move
forward
I
shall
know
nothing
of
where
they
are
or
*NL*
who
they
are
.
''
But
then
he
shoved
her
with
his
knee
,
and
in
an
excited
*NL*
whisper
said
,
``
Fetch
it
,
Laska
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
's
what
he
wishes
,
I
'll
do
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
answer
for
*NL*
myself
now
,
''
she
thought
,
and
darted
forward
as
fast
as
her
legs
would
*NL*
carry
her
between
the
thick
bushes
.
She
scented
nothing
now
;
she
could
*NL*
only
see
and
hear
,
without
understanding
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
paces
from
her
former
place
a
grouse
rose
with
a
guttural
cry
and
*NL*
the
peculiar
round
sound
of
its
wings
.
And
immediately
after
the
shot
it
*NL*
splashed
heavily
with
its
white
breast
on
the
wet
mire
.
Another
bird
did
*NL*
not
linger
,
but
rose
behind
Levin
without
the
dog
.
When
Levin
turned
*NL*
towards
it
,
it
was
already
some
way
off
.
But
his
shot
caught
it
.
Flying
*NL*
twenty
paces
further
,
the
second
grouse
rose
upwards
,
and
whirling
round
*NL*
like
a
ball
,
dropped
heavily
on
a
dry
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
this
is
going
to
be
some
good
!
''
thought
Levin
,
packing
the
warm
*NL*
and
fat
grouse
into
his
game
bag
.
``
Eh
,
Laska
,
will
it
be
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
,
after
loading
his
gun
,
moved
on
,
the
sun
had
fully
risen
,
*NL*
though
unseen
behind
the
storm-clouds
.
The
moon
had
lost
all
of
its
*NL*
luster
,
and
was
like
a
white
cloud
in
the
sky
.
Not
a
single
star
could
*NL*
be
seen
.
The
sedge
,
silvery
with
dew
before
,
now
shone
like
gold
.
The
*NL*
stagnant
pools
were
all
like
amber
.
The
blue
of
the
grass
had
changed
to
*NL*
yellow-green
.
The
marsh
birds
twittered
and
swarmed
about
the
brook
and
*NL*
upon
the
bushes
that
glittered
with
dew
and
cast
long
shadows
.
A
hawk
*NL*
woke
up
and
settled
on
a
haycock
,
turning
its
head
from
side
to
side
and
*NL*
looking
discontentedly
at
the
marsh
.
Crows
were
flying
about
the
field
,
*NL*
and
a
bare-legged
boy
was
driving
the
horses
to
an
old
man
,
who
had
got
*NL*
up
from
under
his
long
coat
and
was
combing
his
hair
.
The
smoke
from
the
*NL*
gun
was
white
as
milk
over
the
green
of
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
boys
ran
up
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
,
there
were
ducks
here
yesterday
!
''
he
shouted
to
him
,
and
he
*NL*
walked
a
little
way
off
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
was
doubly
pleased
,
in
sight
of
the
boy
,
who
expressed
his
*NL*
approval
,
at
killing
three
snipe
,
one
after
another
,
straight
off
.

*NL*
The
sportsman
's
saying
,
that
if
the
first
beast
or
the
first
bird
is
not
*NL*
missed
,
the
day
will
be
lucky
,
turned
out
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Levin
,
weary
,
hungry
,
and
happy
after
a
tramp
of
twenty
*NL*
miles
,
returned
to
his
night
's
lodging
with
nineteen
head
of
fine
game
*NL*
and
one
duck
,
which
he
tied
to
his
belt
,
as
it
would
not
go
into
the
*NL*
game
bag
.
His
companions
had
long
been
awake
,
and
had
had
time
to
get
*NL*
hungry
and
have
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
bit
,
wait
a
bit
,
I
know
there
are
nineteen
,
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
counting
a
second
time
over
the
grouse
and
snipe
,
that
looked
so
much
*NL*
less
important
now
,
bent
and
dry
and
bloodstained
,
with
heads
crooked
*NL*
aside
,
than
they
did
when
they
were
flying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
number
was
verified
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
envy
pleased
Levin
.
*NL*
He
was
pleased
too
on
returning
to
find
the
man
sent
by
Kitty
with
a
*NL*
note
was
already
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
perfectly
well
and
happy
.
If
you
were
uneasy
about
me
,
you
can
*NL*
feel
easier
than
ever
.
I
've
a
new
bodyguard
,
Marya
Vlasyevna
,
''
--
this
was
*NL*
the
midwife
,
a
new
and
important
personage
in
Levin
's
domestic
life
.
*NL*
``
She
has
come
to
have
a
look
at
me
.
She
found
me
perfectly
well
,
and
we
*NL*
have
kept
her
till
you
are
back
.
All
are
happy
and
well
,
and
please
,
*NL*
do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
to
come
back
,
but
,
if
the
sport
is
good
,
stay
*NL*
another
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
pleasures
,
his
lucky
shooting
and
the
letter
from
his
wife
,
*NL*
were
so
great
that
two
slightly
disagreeable
incidents
passed
lightly
*NL*
over
Levin
.
One
was
that
the
chestnut
trace
horse
,
who
had
been
*NL*
unmistakably
overworked
on
the
previous
day
,
was
off
his
feed
and
out
of
*NL*
sorts
.
The
coachman
said
he
was
``
Overdriven
yesterday
,
Konstantin
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
.
Yes
,
indeed
!
driven
ten
miles
with
no
sense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
unpleasant
incident
,
which
for
the
first
minute
destroyed
his
*NL*
good
humor
,
though
later
he
laughed
at
it
a
great
deal
,
was
to
find
that
*NL*
of
all
the
provisions
Kitty
had
provided
in
such
abundance
that
one
*NL*
would
have
thought
there
was
enough
for
a
week
,
nothing
was
left
.
On
his
*NL*
way
back
,
tired
and
hungry
from
shooting
,
Levin
had
so
distinct
a
vision
*NL*
of
meat-pies
that
as
he
approached
the
hut
he
seemed
to
smell
and
taste
*NL*
them
,
as
Laska
had
smelt
the
game
,
and
he
immediately
told
Philip
to
*NL*
give
him
some
.
It
appeared
that
there
were
no
pies
left
,
nor
even
any
*NL*
chicken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
fellow
's
appetite
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
laughing
and
*NL*
pointing
at
Vassenka
Veslovsky
.
``
I
never
suffer
from
loss
of
appetite
,
*NL*
but
he
's
really
marvelous
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
ca
n't
be
helped
,
''
said
Levin
,
looking
gloomily
at
Veslovsky
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
Philip
,
give
me
some
beef
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
beef
's
been
eaten
,
and
the
bones
given
to
the
dogs
,
''
answered
*NL*
Philip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
so
hurt
that
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
vexation
,
``
You
might
have
*NL*
left
me
something
!
''
and
he
felt
ready
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
put
away
the
game
,
''
he
said
in
a
shaking
voice
to
Philip
,
trying
*NL*
not
to
look
at
Vassenka
,
``
and
cover
them
with
some
nettles
.
And
you
*NL*
might
at
least
ask
for
some
milk
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
had
drunk
some
milk
,
he
felt
ashamed
immediately
at
having
*NL*
shown
his
annoyance
to
a
stranger
,
and
he
began
to
laugh
at
his
hungry
*NL*
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
they
went
shooting
again
,
and
Veslovsky
had
several
*NL*
successful
shots
,
and
in
the
night
they
drove
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
homeward
journey
was
as
lively
as
their
drive
out
had
been
.
*NL*
Veslovsky
sang
songs
and
related
with
enjoyment
his
adventures
with
the
*NL*
peasants
,
who
had
regaled
him
with
vodka
,
and
said
to
him
,
``
Excuse
our
*NL*
homely
ways
,
''
and
his
night
's
adventures
with
kiss-in-the-ring
and
the
*NL*
servant-girl
and
the
peasant
,
who
had
asked
him
was
he
married
,
and
on
*NL*
learning
that
he
was
not
,
said
to
him
,
``
Well
,
mind
you
do
n't
run
after
*NL*
other
men
's
wives
--
you
'd
better
get
one
of
your
own
.
''
These
words
had
*NL*
particularly
amused
Veslovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Altogether
,
I
've
enjoyed
our
outing
awfully
.
And
you
,
Levin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
very
much
,
''
Levin
said
quite
sincerely
.
It
was
particularly
*NL*
delightful
to
him
to
have
got
rid
of
the
hostility
he
had
been
feeling
*NL*
towards
Vassenka
Veslovsky
at
home
,
and
to
feel
instead
the
most
*NL*
friendly
disposition
to
him
.

Next
day
at
ten
o'clock
Levin
,
who
had
already
gone
his
rounds
,
knocked
*NL*
at
the
room
where
Vassenka
had
been
put
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Entrez
!

''
Veslovsky
called
to
him
.
``
Excuse
me
,
I
've
only
just
finished
*NL*
my
ablutions
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
standing
before
him
in
his
underclothes
*NL*
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
me
,
please
.
''
Levin
sat
down
in
the
window
.
``
Have
you
slept
*NL*
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
the
dead
.
What
sort
of
day
is
it
for
shooting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
take
,
tea
or
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
.
I
'll
wait
till
lunch
.
I
'm
really
ashamed
.
I
suppose
the
ladies
*NL*
are
down
?
A
walk
now
would
be
capital
.
You
show
me
your
horses

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
walking
about
the
garden
,
visiting
the
stable
,
and
even
doing
some
*NL*
gymnastic
exercises
together
on
the
parallel
bars
,
Levin
returned
to
the
*NL*
house
with
his
guest
,
and
went
with
him
into
the
drawing
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
splendid
shooting
,
and
so
many
delightful
experiences
!
''
said
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
going
up
to
Kitty
,
who
was
sitting
at
the
samovar
.
``
What
a
*NL*
pity
ladies
are
cut
off
from
these
delights
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
he
must
say
something
to
the
lady
of
the
house
,
''
Levin
*NL*
said
to
himself
.
Again
he
fancied
something
in
the
smile
,
in
the
*NL*
all-conquering
air
with
which
their
guest
addressed
Kitty
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
,
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
with
Marya
*NL*
Vlasyevna
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
called
Levin
to
her
side
,
and
began
*NL*
to
talk
to
him
about
moving
to
Moscow
for
Kitty
's
confinement
,
and
*NL*
getting
ready
rooms
for
them
.
Just
as
Levin
had
disliked
all
the
trivial
*NL*
preparations
for
his
wedding
,
as
derogatory
to
the
grandeur
of
the
*NL*
event
,
now
he
felt
still
more
offensive
the
preparations
for
the
*NL*
approaching
birth
,
the
date
of
which
they
reckoned
,
it
seemed
,
on
their
*NL*
fingers
.
He
tried
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
these
discussions
of
the
best
*NL*
patterns
of
long
clothes
for
the
coming
baby
;
tried
to
turn
away
and
*NL*
avoid
seeing
the
mysterious
,
endless
strips
of
knitting
,
the
triangles
*NL*
of
linen
,
and
so
on
,
to
which
Dolly
attached
special
importance
.
The
*NL*
birth
of
a
son
-LRB-
he
was
certain
it
would
be
a
son
-RRB-
which
was
promised
*NL*
him
,
but
which
he
still
could
not
believe
in
--
so
marvelous
it
*NL*
seemed
--
presented
itself
to
his
mind
,
on
one
hand
,
as
a
happiness
so
*NL*
immense
,
and
therefore
so
incredible
;
on
the
other
,
as
an
event
so
*NL*
mysterious
,
that
this
assumption
of
a
definite
knowledge
of
what
would
*NL*
be
,
and
consequent
preparation
for
it
,
as
for
something
ordinary
that
*NL*
did
happen
to
people
,
jarred
on
him
as
confusing
and
humiliating
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
princess
did
not
understand
his
feelings
,
and
put
down
his
*NL*
reluctance
to
think
and
talk
about
it
to
carelessness
and
indifference
,
*NL*
and
so
she
gave
him
no
peace
.
She
had
commissioned
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
to
look
at
a
flat
,
and
now
she
called
Levin
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
princess
.
Do
as
you
think
fit
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
decide
when
you
will
move
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
do
n't
know
.
I
know
millions
of
children
are
born
away
from
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
doctors
...
why
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
so
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
as
Kitty
wishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
talk
to
Kitty
about
it
!
Do
you
want
me
to
frighten
her
?
Why
,
*NL*
this
spring
Natalia
Golitzina
died
from
having
an
ignorant
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
do
just
what
you
say
,
''
he
said
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
began
talking
to
him
,
but
he
did
not
hear
her
.
Though
the
*NL*
conversation
with
the
princess
had
indeed
jarred
upon
him
,
he
was
*NL*
gloomy
,
not
on
account
of
that
conversation
,
but
from
what
he
saw
at
the
*NL*
samovar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
impossible
,
''
he
thought
,
glancing
now
and
then
at
Vassenka
*NL*
bending
over
Kitty
,
telling
her
something
with
his
charming
smile
,
and
*NL*
at
her
,
flushed
and
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
not
nice
in
Vassenka
's
attitude
,
in
his
eyes
,
in
his
*NL*
smile
.
Levin
even
saw
something
not
nice
in
Kitty
's
attitude
and
look
.
*NL*
And
again
the
light
died
away
in
his
eyes
.
Again
,
as
before
,
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
,
without
the
slightest
transition
,
he
felt
cast
down
from
a
*NL*
pinnacle
of
happiness
,
peace
,
and
dignity
,
into
an
abyss
of
despair
,
*NL*
rage
,
and
humiliation
.
Again
everything
and
everyone
had
become
hateful
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
just
as
you
think
best
,
princess
,
''
he
said
again
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavy
is
the
cap
of
Monomach
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
playfully
,
*NL*
hinting
,
evidently
,
not
simply
at
the
princess
's
conversation
,
but
at
*NL*
the
cause
of
Levin
's
agitation
,
which
he
had
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
late
you
are
today
,
Dolly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
got
up
to
greet
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
Vassenka
only
rose
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
and
with
the
lack
of
courtesy
to
ladies
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
modern
young
man
,
he
scarcely
bowed
,
and
resumed
his
conversation
again
,
*NL*
laughing
at
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
worried
about
Masha
.
She
did
not
sleep
well
,
and
is
*NL*
dreadfully
tiresome
today
,
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
Vassenka
had
started
with
Kitty
was
running
on
the
same
*NL*
lines
as
on
the
previous
evening
,
discussing
Anna
,
and
whether
love
is
*NL*
to
be
put
higher
than
worldly
considerations
.
Kitty
disliked
the
*NL*
conversation
,
and
she
was
disturbed
both
by
the
subject
and
the
tone
in
*NL*
which
it
was
conducted
,
and
also
by
the
knowledge
of
the
effect
it
would
*NL*
have
on
her
husband
.
But
she
was
too
simple
and
innocent
to
know
how
to
*NL*
cut
short
this
conversation
,
or
even
to
conceal
the
superficial
pleasure
*NL*
afforded
her
by
the
young
man
's
very
obvious
admiration
.
She
wanted
to
*NL*
stop
it
,
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
Whatever
she
did
she
knew
*NL*
would
be
observed
by
her
husband
,
and
the
worst
interpretation
put
on
*NL*
it
.
And
,
in
fact
,
when
she
asked
Dolly
what
was
wrong
with
Masha
,
and
*NL*
Vassenka
,
waiting
till
this
uninteresting
conversation
was
over
,
began
*NL*
to
gaze
indifferently
at
Dolly
,
the
question
struck
Levin
as
an
*NL*
unnatural
and
disgusting
piece
of
hypocrisy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
shall
we
go
and
look
for
mushrooms
today
?
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all
means
,
please
,
and
I
shall
come
too
,
''
said
Kitty
,
and
she
*NL*
blushed
.
She
wanted
from
politeness
to
ask
Vassenka
whether
he
would
*NL*
come
,
and
she
did
not
ask
him
.
``
Where
are
you
going
,
Kostya
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
her
husband
with
a
guilty
face
,
as
he
passed
by
her
with
a
resolute
*NL*
step
.
This
guilty
air
confirmed
all
his
suspicions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mechanician
came
when
I
was
away
;
I
have
n't
seen
him
yet
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
not
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
downstairs
,
but
before
he
had
time
to
leave
his
study
he
heard
*NL*
his
wife
's
familiar
footsteps
running
with
reckless
speed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
said
to
her
shortly
.
``
We
are
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
she
said
to
the
German
mechanician
;
``
I
want
a
few
*NL*
words
with
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
German
would
have
left
the
room
,
but
Levin
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
is
at
three
?
''
queried
the
German
.
``
I
must
n't
be
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
answer
him
,
but
walked
out
himself
with
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
?
''
he
said
to
her
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
look
her
in
the
face
,
and
did
not
care
to
see
that
she
in
her
*NL*
condition
was
trembling
all
over
,
and
had
a
piteous
,
crushed
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
...
I
want
to
say
that
we
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
;
that
this
is
*NL*
misery
...
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
are
here
at
the
sideboard
,
''
he
said
angrily
;
``
do
n't
make
a
*NL*
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
's
go
in
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
standing
in
the
passage
.
Kitty
would
have
gone
into
the
next
*NL*
room
,
but
there
the
English
governess
was
giving
Tanya
a
lesson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
into
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
garden
they
came
upon
a
peasant
weeding
the
path
.
And
no
longer
*NL*
considering
that
the
peasant
could
see
her
tear-stained
and
his
agitated
*NL*
face
,
that
they
looked
like
people
fleeing
from
some
disaster
,
they
went
*NL*
on
with
rapid
steps
,
feeling
that
they
must
speak
out
and
clear
up
*NL*
misunderstandings
,
must
be
alone
together
,
and
so
get
rid
of
the
misery
*NL*
they
were
both
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
!
It
's
misery
!
I
am
wretched
;
you
are
wretched
.
*NL*
What
for
?
''
she
said
,
when
they
had
at
last
reached
a
solitary
garden
*NL*
seat
at
a
turn
in
the
lime
tree
avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
one
thing
:
was
there
in
his
tone
anything
unseemly
,
not
*NL*
nice
,
humiliatingly
horrible
?
''
he
said
,
standing
before
her
again
in
the
*NL*
same
position
with
his
clenched
fists
on
his
chest
,
as
he
had
stood
*NL*
before
her
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
in
a
shaking
voice
;
``
but
,
Kostya
,
surely
you
see
I
'm
not
*NL*
to
blame
?
All
the
morning
I
've
been
trying
to
take
a
tone
...
but
such
*NL*
people
...
Why
did
he
come
?
How
happy
we
were
!
''
she
said
,
breathless
*NL*
with
the
sobs
that
shook
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
nothing
had
been
pursuing
them
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
run
*NL*
away
from
,
and
they
could
not
possibly
have
found
anything
very
*NL*
delightful
on
that
garden
seat
,
the
gardener
saw
with
astonishment
that
*NL*
they
passed
him
on
their
way
home
with
comforted
and
radiant
faces
.

Chapter
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
escorting
his
wife
upstairs
,
Levin
went
to
Dolly
's
part
of
the
*NL*
house
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
for
her
part
,
was
in
great
distress
too
that
*NL*
day
.
She
was
walking
about
the
room
,
talking
angrily
to
a
little
girl
,
*NL*
who
stood
in
the
corner
roaring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
shall
stand
all
day
in
the
corner
,
and
have
your
dinner
all
*NL*
alone
,
and
not
see
one
of
your
dolls
,
and
I
wo
n't
make
you
a
new
frock
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
not
knowing
how
to
punish
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
is
a
disgusting
child
!
''
she
turned
to
Levin
.
``
Where
does
she
*NL*
get
such
wicked
propensities
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
has
she
done
?
''
Levin
said
without
much
interest
,
for
he
had
*NL*
wanted
to
ask
her
advice
,
and
so
was
annoyed
that
he
had
come
at
an
*NL*
unlucky
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grisha
and
she
went
into
the
raspberries
,
and
there
...
I
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
you
really
what
she
did
.
It
's
a
thousand
pities
Miss
Elliot
's
not
with
*NL*
us
.
This
one
sees
to
nothing
--
she
's
a
machine
...
_
Figurez-vous
que
la
*NL*
petite
_
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Darya
Alexandrovna
described
Masha
's
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
proves
nothing
;
it
's
not
a
question
of
evil
propensities
at
all
,
*NL*
it
's
simply
mischief
,
''
Levin
assured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are
upset
about
something
?
What
have
you
come
for
?
''
asked
*NL*
Dolly
.
``
What
's
going
on
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
tone
of
her
question
Levin
heard
that
it
would
be
easy
for
*NL*
him
to
say
what
he
had
meant
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
been
in
there

I
've
been
alone
in
the
garden
with
Kitty

had
a
quarrel
for
the
second
time
since

Stiva
came

*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
looked
at
him
with
her
shrewd
,
comprehending
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

tell
me

honor
bright

has
there
been

not
in
Kitty

but
in
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
behavior
,
a
tone
which
might
be
unpleasant
--
not
*NL*
unpleasant
,
but
horrible
,
offensive
to
a
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
how
shall
I
say
...
Stay

stay
in
the
corner

''
she
said
to
*NL*
Masha
,
who
,
detecting
a
faint
smile
in
her
mother
's
face
,
had
been
*NL*
turning
round
.
``
The
opinion
of
the
world
would
be
that
he
is
behaving
as
*NL*
young
men
do
behave

only
be
flattered
by
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

said
Levin
gloomily
;
``
but
you
noticed
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
only
I
,
but
Stiva
noticed

Just
after
breakfast
he
said
to
me
in
*NL*
so
many
words
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

's
all
right
then

now

'll
send

*NL*
said
Levin

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Are

Dolly
cried
in
horror
;

nonsense

she
said
,
laughing
.
``
You

she
*NL*
said
to
Masha
.
``
No

speak
to
Stiva
.
He
'll
take
him
*NL*
away
.
He
can
say
you
're
expecting
visitors
.
Altogether
he
does
n't
fit
*NL*
into
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
'll
do
it
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
quarrel
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
I
shall
so
enjoy
it
,
''
Levin
said
,
his
eyes
flashing
with
*NL*
real
enjoyment
.
``
Come
,
forgive
her
,
Dolly
,
she
wo
n't
do
it
again
,
''
he
*NL*
said
of
the
little
sinner
,
who
had
not
gone
to
Fanny
,
but
was
standing
*NL*
irresolutely
before
her
mother
,
waiting
and
looking
up
from
under
her
*NL*
brows
to
catch
her
mother
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
glanced
at
her
.
The
child
broke
into
sobs
,
hid
her
face
on
*NL*
her
mother
's
lap
,
and
Dolly
laid
her
thin
,
tender
hand
on
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
there
in
common
between
us
and
him
?
''
thought
Levin
,
and
he
*NL*
went
off
to
look
for
Veslovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
passed
through
the
passage
he
gave
orders
for
the
carriage
to
be
*NL*
got
ready
to
drive
to
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spring
was
broken
yesterday
,
''
said
the
footman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
covered
trap
,
then
,
and
make
haste
.
Where
's
the
visitor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
's
gone
to
his
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
came
upon
Veslovsky
at
the
moment
when
the
latter
,
having
unpacked
*NL*
his
things
from
his
trunk
,
and
laid
out
some
new
songs
,
was
putting
on
*NL*
his
gaiters
to
go
out
riding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
there
was
something
exceptional
in
Levin
's
face
,
or
that
*NL*
Vassenka
was
himself
conscious
that
_
ce
petit
brin
de
cour
_
he
was
*NL*
making
was
out
of
place
in
this
family
,
but
he
was
somewhat
-LRB-
as
much
as
*NL*
a
young
man
in
society
can
be
-RRB-
disconcerted
at
Levin
's
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ride
in
gaiters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
much
cleaner
,
''
said
Vassenka
,
putting
his
fat
leg
on
a
chair
,
*NL*
fastening
the
bottom
hook
,
and
smiling
with
simple-hearted
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
undoubtedly
a
good-natured
fellow
,
and
Levin
felt
sorry
for
him
*NL*
and
ashamed
of
himself
,
as
his
host
,
when
he
saw
the
shy
look
on
*NL*
Vassenka
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
lay
a
piece
of
stick
which
they
had
broken
together
that
*NL*
morning
,
trying
their
strength
.
Levin
took
the
fragment
in
his
hands
and
*NL*
began
smashing
it
up
,
breaking
bits
off
the
stick
,
not
knowing
how
to
*NL*
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
...
''
He
paused
,
but
suddenly
,
remembering
Kitty
and
everything
*NL*
that
had
happened
,
he
said
,
looking
him
resolutely
in
the
face
:
``
I
have
*NL*
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put-to
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
Vassenka
began
in
surprise
.
``
To
drive
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
to
drive
to
the
station
,
''
Levin
said
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
away
,
or
has
something
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happens
that
I
expect
visitors
,
''
said
Levin
,
his
strong
fingers
more
*NL*
and
more
rapidly
breaking
off
the
ends
of
the
split
stick
.
``
And
I
'm
not
*NL*
expecting
visitors
,
and
nothing
has
happened
,
but
I
beg
you
to
go
away
.
*NL*
You
can
explain
my
rudeness
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
drew
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
you
to
explain
...
''
he
said
with
dignity
,
understanding
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
explain
,
''
Levin
said
softly
and
deliberately
,
trying
to
control
*NL*
the
trembling
of
his
jaw
;
``
and
you
'd
better
not
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
the
split
ends
were
all
broken
off
,
Levin
clutched
the
thick
ends
*NL*
in
his
finger
,
broke
the
stick
in
two
,
and
carefully
caught
the
end
as
*NL*
it
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
the
sight
of
those
nervous
fingers
,
of
the
muscles
he
had
*NL*
proved
that
morning
at
gymnastics
,
of
the
glittering
eyes
,
the
soft
*NL*
voice
,
and
quivering
jaws
,
convinced
Vassenka
better
than
any
words
.
He
*NL*
bowed
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
and
smiling
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
not
see
Oblonsky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shrug
and
the
smile
did
not
irritate
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
was
there
for
him
to
do
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
send
him
to
you
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
madness
is
this
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
when
,
after
hearing
*NL*
from
his
friend
that
he
was
being
turned
out
of
the
house
,
he
found
*NL*
Levin
in
the
garden
,
where
he
was
walking
about
waiting
for
his
guest
's
*NL*
departure
.
''
_
Mais
c'est
ridicule
!
_
What
fly
has
stung
you
?
_
Mais

*NL*
du

_
What
did
you
think
,
if
a
young
man
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
place
where
Levin
had
been
stung
was
evidently
still
sore
,
for
*NL*
he
turned
pale
again
,
when
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
would
have
enlarged
on
*NL*
the
reason
,
and
he
himself
cut
him
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
go
into
it
!
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
feel
ashamed
of
how
I
'm
*NL*
treating
you
and
him
.
But
it
wo
n't
be
,
I
imagine
,
a
great
grief
to
him
*NL*
to
go
,
and
his
presence
was
distasteful
to
me
and
to
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
insulting
to
him
!
_
Et
puis
c'est
ridicule
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
me
it
's
both
insulting
and
distressing
!
And
I
'm
not
at
fault
in
*NL*
any
way
,
and
there
's
no
need
for
me
to
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
I
did
n't
expect
of
you
!
_
On
peut
etre
jaloux
,
mais
a
ce
*NL*
point
,
c'est

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
turned
quickly
,
and
walked
away
from
him
into
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
avenue
,
and
he
went
on
walking
up
and
down
alone
.
Soon
he
heard
the
*NL*
rumble
of
the
trap
,
and
saw
from
behind
the
trees
how
Vassenka
,
sitting
*NL*
in
the
hay
-LRB-
unluckily
there
was
no
seat
in
the
trap
-RRB-
in
his
Scotch
cap
,
*NL*
was
driven
along
the
avenue
,
jolting
up
and
down
over
the
ruts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
Levin
thought
,
when
a
footman
ran
out
of
the
house
and
*NL*
stopped
the
trap
.
It
was
the
mechanician
,
whom
Levin
had
totally
*NL*
forgotten
.
The
mechanician
,
bowing
low
,
said
something
to
Veslovsky
,
*NL*
then
clambered
into
the
trap
,
and
they
drove
off
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
and
the
princess
were
much
upset
by
Levin
's
action
.
*NL*
And
he
himself
felt
not
only
in
the
highest
degree
_
ridicule
_
,
but
also
*NL*
utterly
guilty
and
disgraced
.
But
remembering
what
sufferings
he
and
his
*NL*
wife
had
been
through
,
when
he
asked
himself
how
he
should
act
another
*NL*
time
,
he
answered
that
he
should
do
just
the
same
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
,
towards
the
end
of
that
day
,
everyone
except
the
*NL*
princess
,
who
could
not
pardon
Levin
's
action
,
became
extraordinarily
*NL*
lively
and
good
humored
,
like
children
after
a
punishment
or
grown-up
*NL*
people
after
a
dreary
,
ceremonious
reception
,
so
that
by
the
evening
*NL*
Vassenka
's
dismissal
was
spoken
of
,
in
the
absence
of
the
princess
,
as
*NL*
though
it
were
some
remote
event
.
And
Dolly
,
who
had
inherited
her
*NL*
father
's
gift
of
humorous
storytelling
,
made
Varenka
helpless
with
*NL*
laughter
as
she
related
for
the
third
and
fourth
time
,
always
with
fresh
*NL*
humorous
additions
,
how
she
had
only
just
put
on
her
new
shoes
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
visitor
,
and
on
going
into
the
drawing
room
,
heard
*NL*
suddenly
the
rumble
of
the
trap
.
And
who
should
be
in
the
trap
but
*NL*
Vassenka
himself
,
with
his
Scotch
cap
,
and
his
songs
and
his
gaiters
,
*NL*
and
all
,
sitting
in
the
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
you
'd
ordered
out
the
carriage

But
no

and
then
I
hear
:
*NL*
`
Stop
!
'
Oh
,
I
thought
they
've
relented
.
I
look
out
,
and
behold
a
fat
*NL*
German
being
sat
down
by
him
and
driving
away

And
my
new

all

for
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
carried
out
her
intention
and
went
to
see
Anna
.
She
*NL*
was
sorry
to
annoy
her
sister
and
to
do
anything
Levin
disliked
.
She
*NL*
quite
understood
how
right
the
Levins
were
in
not
wishing
to
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
Vronsky
.
But
she
felt
she
must
go
and
see
Anna
,
and
*NL*
show
her
that
her
feelings
could
not
be
changed
,
in
spite
of
the
change
*NL*
in
her
position
.
That
she
might
be
independent
of
the
Levins
in
this
*NL*
expedition
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
sent
to
the
village
to
hire
horses
for
*NL*
the
drive
;
but
Levin
learning
of
it
went
to
her
to
protest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
suppose
that
I
dislike
your
going
?
But
,
even
if
I
did
*NL*
dislike
it
,
I
should
still
more
dislike
your
not
taking
my
horses
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
You
never
told
me
that
you
were
going
for
certain
.
Hiring
horses
*NL*
in
the
village
is
disagreeable
to
me
,
and
,
what
's
of
more
importance
,
*NL*
they
'll
undertake
the
job
and
never
get
you
there
.
I
have
horses
.
And
if
*NL*
you
do
n't
want
to
wound
me
,
you
'll
take
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
to
consent
,
and
on
the
day
fixed
Levin
had
ready
*NL*
for
his
sister-in-law
a
set
of
four
horses
and
relays
,
getting
them
*NL*
together
from
the
farm
-
and
saddle-horses
--
not
at
all
a
smart-looking
*NL*
set
,
but
capable
of
taking
Darya
Alexandrovna
the
whole
distance
in
a
*NL*
single
day
.
At
that
moment
,
when
horses
were
wanted
for
the
princess
,
*NL*
who
was
going
,
and
for
the
midwife
,
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
Levin
*NL*
to
make
up
the
number
,
but
the
duties
of
hospitality
would
not
let
him
*NL*
allow
Darya
Alexandrovna
to
hire
horses
when
staying
in
his
house
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
was
well
aware
that
the
twenty
roubles
that
would
be
asked
*NL*
for
the
journey
were
a
serious
matter
for
her
;
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
*NL*
pecuniary
affairs
,
which
were
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
,
were
taken
*NL*
to
heart
by
the
Levins
as
if
they
were
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
by
Levin
's
advice
,
started
before
daybreak
.
The
road
*NL*
was
good
,
the
carriage
comfortable
,
the
horses
trotted
along
merrily
,
*NL*
and
on
the
box
,
besides
the
coachman
,
sat
the
counting-house
clerk
,
whom
*NL*
Levin
was
sending
instead
of
a
groom
for
greater
security
.
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
dozed
and
waked
up
only
on
reaching
the
inn
where
the
*NL*
horses
were
to
be
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
drinking
tea
at
the
same
well-to-do
peasant
's
with
whom
Levin
had
*NL*
stayed
on
the
way
to
Sviazhsky
's
,
and
chatting
with
the
women
about
*NL*
their
children
,
and
with
the
old
man
about
Count
Vronsky
,
whom
the
*NL*
latter
praised
very
highly
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
went
on
*NL*
again
.
At
home
,
looking
after
her
children
,
she
had
no
time
to
think
.
So
*NL*
now
,
after
this
journey
of
four
hours
,
all
the
thoughts
she
had
*NL*
suppressed
before
rushed
swarming
into
her
brain
,
and
she
thought
over
*NL*
all
her
life
as
she
never
had
before
,
and
from
the
most
different
points
*NL*
of
view
.
Her
thoughts
seemed
strange
even
to
herself
.
At
first
she
*NL*
thought
about
the
children
,
about
whom
she
was
uneasy
,
although
the
*NL*
princess
and
Kitty
-LRB-
she
reckoned
more
upon
her
-RRB-
had
promised
to
look
*NL*
after
them
.
``
If
only
Masha
does
not
begin
her
naughty
tricks
,
if
Grisha
*NL*
is
n't
kicked
by
a
horse
,
and
Lily
's
stomach
is
n't
upset
again
!
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
But
these
questions
of
the
present
were
succeeded
by
questions
*NL*
of
the
immediate
future
.
She
began
thinking
how
she
had
to
get
a
new
*NL*
flat
in
Moscow
for
the
coming
winter
,
to
renew
the
drawing
room
*NL*
furniture
,
and
to
make
her
elder
girl
a
cloak
.
Then
questions
of
the
*NL*
more
remote
future
occurred
to
her
:
how
she
was
to
place
her
children
in
*NL*
the
world
.
``
The
girls
are
all
right
,
''
she
thought
;
``
but
the
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well
that
I
'm
teaching
Grisha
,
but
of
course
that
's
only
*NL*
because
I
am
free
myself
now
,
I
'm
not
with
child
.
Stiva
,
of
course
,
*NL*
there
's
no
counting
on
.
And
with
the
help
of
good-natured
friends
I
can
*NL*
bring
them
up
;
but
if
there
's
another
baby
coming
?
...
''
And
the
thought
*NL*
struck
her
how
untruly
it
was
said
that
the
curse
laid
on
woman
was
that
*NL*
in
sorrow
she
should
bring
forth
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
birth
itself
,
that
's
nothing
;
but
the
months
of
carrying
the
*NL*
child
--
that
's
what
's
so
intolerable
,
''
she
thought
,
picturing
to
herself
*NL*
her
last
pregnancy
,
and
the
death
of
the
last
baby
.
And
she
recalled
the
*NL*
conversation
she
had
just
had
with
the
young
woman
at
the
inn
.
On
being
*NL*
asked
whether
she
had
any
children
,
the
handsome
young
woman
had
*NL*
answered
cheerfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
girl
baby
,
but
God
set
me
free
;
I
buried
her
last
Lent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
grieve
very
much
for
her
?
''
asked
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
grieve
?
The
old
man
has
grandchildren
enough
as
it
is
.
It
was
only
*NL*
a
trouble
.
No
working
,
nor
nothing
.
Only
a
tie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
answer
had
struck
Darya
Alexandrovna
as
revolting
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
good-natured
and
pleasing
face
of
the
young
woman
;
but
now
she
could
not
*NL*
help
recalling
these
words
.
In
those
cynical
words
there
was
indeed
a
*NL*
grain
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
altogether
,
''
thought
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
looking
back
over
her
*NL*
whole
existence
during
those
fifteen
years
of
her
married
life
,
*NL*
``
pregnancy
,
sickness
,
mental
incapacity
,
indifference
to
everything
,
and
*NL*
most
of
all
--
hideousness
.
Kitty
,
young
and
pretty
as
she
is
,
even
Kitty
*NL*
has
lost
her
looks
;
and
I
when
I
'm
with
child
become
hideous
,
I
know
it
.
*NL*
The
birth
,
the
agony
,
the
hideous
agonies
,
that
last
moment
...
then
the
*NL*
nursing
,
the
sleepless
nights
,
the
fearful
pains
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
shuddered
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
pain
from
*NL*
sore
breasts
which
she
had
suffered
with
almost
every
child
.
``
Then
the
*NL*
children
's
illnesses
,
that
everlasting
apprehension
;
then
bringing
them
*NL*
up
;
evil
propensities
''
-LRB-
she
thought
of
little
Masha
's
crime
among
the
*NL*
raspberries
-RRB-
,
``
education
,
Latin
--
it
's
all
so
incomprehensible
and
*NL*
difficult
.
And
on
the
top
of
it
all
,
the
death
of
these
children
.
''
And
*NL*
there
rose
again
before
her
imagination
the
cruel
memory
,
that
always
*NL*
tore
her
mother
's
heart
,
of
the
death
of
her
last
little
baby
,
who
had
*NL*
died
of
croup
;
his
funeral
,
the
callous
indifference
of
all
at
the
*NL*
little
pink
coffin
,
and
her
own
torn
heart
,
and
her
lonely
anguish
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
the
pale
little
brow
with
its
projecting
temples
,
and
the
*NL*
open
,
wondering
little
mouth
seen
in
the
coffin
at
the
moment
when
it
*NL*
was
being
covered
with
the
little
pink
lid
with
a
cross
braided
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
this
,
what
's
it
for
?
What
is
to
come
of
it
all
?
That
I
'm
*NL*
wasting
my
life
,
never
having
a
moment
's
peace
,
either
with
child
,
or
*NL*
nursing
a
child
,
forever
irritable
,
peevish
,
wretched
myself
and
*NL*
worrying
others
,
repulsive
to
my
husband
,
while
the
children
are
growing
*NL*
up
unhappy
,
badly
educated
,
and
penniless
.
Even
now
,
if
it
were
n't
for
*NL*
spending
the
summer
at
the
Levins
'
,
I
do
n't
know
how
we
should
be
*NL*
managing
to
live
.
Of
course
Kostya
and
Kitty
have
so
much
tact
that
we
*NL*
do
n't
feel
it
;
but
it
ca
n't
go
on
.
They
'll
have
children
,
they
wo
n't
be
*NL*
able
to
keep
us
;
it
's
a
drag
on
them
as
it
is
.
How
is
papa
,
who
has
*NL*
hardly
anything
left
for
himself
,
to
help
us
?
So
that
I
ca
n't
even
bring
*NL*
the
children
up
by
myself
,
and
may
find
it
hard
with
the
help
of
other
*NL*
people
,
at
the
cost
of
humiliation
.
Why
,
even
if
we
suppose
the
greatest
*NL*
good
luck
,
that
the
children
do
n't
die
,
and
I
bring
them
up
somehow
.
At
*NL*
the
very
best
they
'll
simply
be
decent
people
.
That
's
all
I
can
hope
*NL*
for
.
And
to
gain
simply
that
--
what
agonies
,
what
toil
!
...
One
's
whole
*NL*
life
ruined
!
''
Again
she
recalled
what
the
young
peasant
woman
had
said
,
*NL*
and
again
she
was
revolted
at
the
thought
;
but
she
could
not
help
*NL*
admitting
that
there
was
a
grain
of
brutal
truth
in
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
far
now
,
Mihail
?
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
asked
the
counting
house
*NL*
clerk
,
to
turn
her
mind
from
thoughts
that
were
frightening
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
this
village
,
they
say
,
it
's
five
miles
.
''
The
carriage
drove
along
*NL*
the
village
street
and
onto
a
bridge
.
On
the
bridge
was
a
crowd
of
*NL*
peasant
women
with
coils
of
ties
for
the
sheaves
on
their
shoulders
,
*NL*
gaily
and
noisily
chattering
.
They
stood
still
on
the
bridge
,
staring
*NL*
inquisitively
at
the
carriage
.
All
the
faces
turned
to
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
looked
to
her
healthy
and
happy
,
making
her
envious
of
*NL*
their
enjoyment
of
life
.
``
They
're
all
living
,
they
're
all
enjoying
*NL*
life
,
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
still
mused
when
she
had
passed
the
peasant
*NL*
women
and
was
driving
uphill
again
at
a
trot
,
seated
comfortably
on
the
*NL*
soft
springs
of
the
old
carriage
,
``
while
I
,
let
out
,
as
it
were
from
*NL*
prison
,
from
the
world
of
worries
that
fret
me
to
death
,
am
only
looking
*NL*
about
me
now
for
an
instant
.
They
all
live
;
those
peasant
women
and
my
*NL*
sister
Natalia
and
Varenka
and
Anna
,
whom
I
am
going
to
see
--
all
,
but
*NL*
not
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
attack
Anna
.
What
for
?
am
I
any
better
?
I
have
,
anyway
,
a
*NL*
husband
I
love
--
not
as
I
should
like
to
love
him
,
still
I
do
love
him
,
*NL*
while
Anna
never
loved
hers
.
How
is
she
to
blame
?
She
wants
to
live
.
God
*NL*
has
put
that
in
our
hearts
.
Very
likely
I
should
have
done
the
same
.
*NL*
Even
to
this
day
I
do
n't
feel
sure
I
did
right
in
listening
to
her
at
*NL*
that
terrible
time
when
she
came
to
me
in
Moscow
.
I
ought
then
to
have
*NL*
cast
off
my
husband
and
have
begun
my
life
fresh
.
I
might
have
loved
and
*NL*
have
been
loved
in
reality
.
And
is
it
any
better
as
it
is
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
respect
him
.
He
's
necessary
to
me
,
''
she
thought
about
her
husband
,
``
and
*NL*
I
put
up
with
him
.
Is
that
any
better
?
At
that
time
I
could
still
have
*NL*
been
admired
,
I
had
beauty
left
me
still
,
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
pursued
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
and
she
would
have
liked
to
look
at
herself
in
the
looking
*NL*
glass
.
She
had
a
traveling
looking
glass
in
her
handbag
,
and
she
wanted
*NL*
to
take
it
out
;
but
looking
at
the
backs
of
the
coachman
and
the
swaying
*NL*
counting
house
clerk
,
she
felt
that
she
would
be
ashamed
if
either
of
*NL*
them
were
to
look
round
,
and
she
did
not
take
out
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
without
looking
in
the
glass
,
she
thought
that
even
now
it
was
not
*NL*
too
late
;
and
she
thought
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
was
always
*NL*
particularly
attentive
to
her
,
of
Stiva
's
good-hearted
friend
,
*NL*
Turovtsin
,
who
had
helped
her
nurse
her
children
through
the
scarlatina
,
*NL*
and
was
in
love
with
her
.
And
there
was
someone
else
,
a
quite
young
man
,
*NL*
who
--
her
husband
had
told
her
it
as
a
joke
--
thought
her
more
beautiful
*NL*
than
either
of
her
sisters
.
And
the
most
passionate
and
impossible
*NL*
romances
rose
before
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
imagination
.
``
Anna
did
quite
*NL*
right
,
and
certainly
I
shall
never
reproach
her
for
it
.
She
is
happy
,
*NL*
she
makes
another
person
happy
,
and
she
's
not
broken
down
as
I
am
,
but
*NL*
most
likely
just
as
she
always
was
,
bright
,
clever
,
open
to
every
*NL*
impression
,
''
thought
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
--
and
a
sly
smile
curved
her
*NL*
lips
,
for
,
as
she
pondered
on
Anna
's
love
affair
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
*NL*
constructed
on
parallel
lines
an
almost
identical
love
affair
for
*NL*
herself
,
with
an
imaginary
composite
figure
,
the
ideal
man
who
was
in
*NL*
love
with
her
.
She
,
like
Anna
,
confessed
the
whole
affair
to
her
*NL*
husband
.
And
the
amazement
and
perplexity
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
at
this
*NL*
avowal
made
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
daydreams
she
reached
the
turning
of
the
highroad
that
led
to
*NL*
Vozdvizhenskoe
.

*NL*
Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
pulled
up
his
four
horses
and
looked
round
to
the
right
,
to
*NL*
a
field
of
rye
,
where
some
peasants
were
sitting
on
a
cart
.
The
counting
*NL*
house
clerk
was
just
going
to
jump
down
,
but
on
second
thoughts
he
*NL*
shouted
peremptorily
to
the
peasants
instead
,
and
beckoned
to
them
to
*NL*
come
up
.
The
wind
,
that
seemed
to
blow
as
they
drove
,
dropped
when
the
*NL*
carriage
stood
still
;
gadflies
settled
on
the
steaming
horses
that
*NL*
angrily
shook
them
off
.
The
metallic
clank
of
a
whetstone
against
a
*NL*
scythe
,
that
came
to
them
from
the
cart
,
ceased
.
One
of
the
peasants
got
*NL*
up
and
came
towards
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
are
slow
!
''
the
counting
house
clerk
shouted
angrily
to
the
*NL*
peasant
who
was
stepping
slowly
with
his
bare
feet
over
the
ruts
of
the
*NL*
rough
dry
road
.
``
Come
along
,
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
curly-headed
old
man
with
a
bit
of
bast
tied
round
his
hair
,
and
his
*NL*
bent
back
dark
with
perspiration
,
came
towards
the
carriage
,
quickening
*NL*
his
steps
,
and
took
hold
of
the
mud-guard
with
his
sunburnt
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vozdvizhenskoe
,
the
manor
house
?
the
count
's
?
''
he
repeated
;
``
go
on
to
*NL*
the
end
of
this
track
.
Then
turn
to
the
left
.
Straight
along
the
avenue
*NL*
and
you
'll
come
right
upon
it
.
But
whom
do
you
want
?
The
count
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
they
at
home
,
my
good
man
?
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
said
vaguely
,
*NL*
not
knowing
how
to
ask
about
Anna
,
even
of
this
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
home
for
sure
,
''
said
the
peasant
,
shifting
from
one
bare
foot
to
the
*NL*
other
,
and
leaving
a
distinct
print
of
five
toes
and
a
heel
in
the
dust
.
*NL*
``
Sure
to
be
at
home
,
''
he
repeated
,
evidently
eager
to
talk
.
``
Only
*NL*
yesterday
visitors
arrived
.
There
's
a
sight
of
visitors
come
.
What
do
*NL*
you
want
?
''
He
turned
round
and
called
to
a
lad
,
who
was
shouting
*NL*
something
to
him
from
the
cart
.
``
Oh
!
They
all
rode
by
here
not
long
*NL*
since
,
to
look
at
a
reaping
machine
.
They
'll
be
home
by
now
.
And
who
*NL*
will
you
be
belonging
to
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
come
a
long
way
,
''
said
the
coachman
,
climbing
onto
the
box
.
``
So
*NL*
it
's
not
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
it
's
just
here
.
As
soon
as
you
get
out
...
''
he
said
,
keeping
*NL*
hold
all
the
while
of
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
healthy-looking
,
broad-shouldered
young
fellow
came
up
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
is
it
laborers
they
want
for
the
harvest
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
keep
to
the
left
,
and
you
'll
come
right
on
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
peasant
,
unmistakably
loth
to
let
the
travelers
go
,
and
eager
to
*NL*
converse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
started
the
horses
,
but
they
were
only
just
turning
off
*NL*
when
the
peasant
shouted
:
``
Stop
!
Hi
,
friend
!
Stop
!
''
called
the
two
*NL*
voices
.
The
coachman
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
coming
!
They
're
yonder
!
''
shouted
the
peasant
.
``
See
what
a
*NL*
turn-out
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
four
persons
on
horseback
,
and
two
in
a
*NL*
_
char-a-banc
_
,
coming
along
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
Vronsky
with
a
jockey
,
Veslovsky
and
Anna
on
horseback
,
and
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
and
Sviazhsky
in
the
_
char-a-banc
_
.
They
had
gone
out
*NL*
to
look
at
the
working
of
a
new
reaping
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
carriage
stopped
,
the
party
on
horseback
were
coming
at
a
*NL*
walking
pace
.
Anna
was
in
front
beside
Veslovsky
.
Anna
,
quietly
walking
*NL*
her
horse
,
a
sturdy
English
cob
with
cropped
mane
and
short
tail
,
her
*NL*
beautiful
head
with
her
black
hair
straying
loose
under
her
high
hat
,
*NL*
her
full
shoulders
,
her
slender
waist
in
her
black
riding
habit
,
and
all
*NL*
the
ease
and
grace
of
her
deportment
,
impressed
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
minute
it
seemed
to
her
unsuitable
for
Anna
to
be
on
*NL*
horseback
.
The
conception
of
riding
on
horseback
for
a
lady
was
,
in
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
mind
,
associated
with
ideas
of
youthful
flirtation
*NL*
and
frivolity
,
which
,
in
her
opinion
,
was
unbecoming
in
Anna
's
position
.
*NL*
But
when
she
had
scrutinized
her
,
seeing
her
closer
,
she
was
at
once
*NL*
reconciled
to
her
riding
.
In
spite
of
her
elegance
,
everything
was
so
*NL*
simple
,
quiet
,
and
dignified
in
the
attitude
,
the
dress
and
the
*NL*
movements
of
Anna
,
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
Anna
,
on
a
hot-looking
gray
cavalry
horse
,
was
Vassenka
Veslovsky
*NL*
in
his
Scotch
cap
with
floating
ribbons
,
his
stout
legs
stretched
out
in
*NL*
front
,
obviously
pleased
with
his
own
appearance
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
*NL*
could
not
suppress
a
good-humored
smile
as
she
recognized
him
.
Behind
*NL*
rode
Vronsky
on
a
dark
bay
mare
,
obviously
heated
from
galloping
.
He
was
*NL*
holding
her
in
,
pulling
at
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
him
rode
a
little
man
in
the
dress
of
a
jockey
.
Sviazhsky
and
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
in
a
new
_
char-a-banc
_
with
a
big
,
raven-black
trotting
*NL*
horse
,
overtook
the
party
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
's
face
suddenly
beamed
with
a
joyful
smile
at
the
instant
when
,
in
*NL*
the
little
figure
huddled
in
a
corner
of
the
old
carriage
,
she
*NL*
recognized
Dolly
.
She
uttered
a
cry
,
started
in
the
saddle
,
and
set
her
*NL*
horse
into
a
gallop
.
On
reaching
the
carriage
she
jumped
off
without
*NL*
assistance
,
and
holding
up
her
riding
habit
,
she
ran
up
to
greet
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
you
and
dared
not
think
it
.
How
delightful
!
You
ca
n't
*NL*
fancy
how
glad
I
am
!
''
she
said
,
at
one
moment
pressing
her
face
against
*NL*
Dolly
and
kissing
her
,
and
at
the
next
holding
her
off
and
examining
her
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
delightful
surprise
,
Alexey
!
''
she
said
,
looking
round
at
*NL*
Vronsky
,
who
had
dismounted
,
and
was
walking
towards
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
taking
off
his
tall
gray
hat
,
went
up
to
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe
how
glad
we
are
to
see
you
,
''
he
said
,
giving
*NL*
peculiar
significance
to
the
words
,
and
showing
his
strong
white
teeth
*NL*
in
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vassenka
Veslovsky
,
without
getting
off
his
horse
,
took
off
his
cap
and
*NL*
greeted
the
visitor
by
gleefully
waving
the
ribbons
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Princess
Varvara
,
''
Anna
said
in
reply
to
a
glance
of
inquiry
*NL*
from
Dolly
as
the
_
char-a-banc
_
drove
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
and
unconsciously
her
face
betrayed
her
*NL*
dissatisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
was
her
husband
's
aunt
,
and
she
had
long
known
her
,
and
*NL*
did
not
respect
her
.
She
knew
that
Princess
Varvara
had
passed
her
whole
*NL*
life
toadying
on
her
rich
relations
,
but
that
she
should
now
be
sponging
*NL*
on
Vronsky
,
a
man
who
was
nothing
to
her
,
mortified
Dolly
on
account
of
*NL*
her
kinship
with
her
husband
.
Anna
noticed
Dolly
's
expression
,
and
was
*NL*
disconcerted
by
it
.
She
blushed
,
dropped
her
riding
habit
,
and
stumbled
*NL*
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
went
up
to
the
_
char-a-banc
_
and
coldly
greeted
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
.
Sviazhsky
too
she
knew
.
He
inquired
how
his
queer
*NL*
friend
with
the
young
wife
was
,
and
running
his
eyes
over
the
*NL*
ill-matched
horses
and
the
carriage
with
its
patched
mud-guards
,
*NL*
proposed
to
the
ladies
that
they
should
get
into
the
_
char-a-banc
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
get
into
this
vehicle
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
horse
is
quiet
,
and
the
*NL*
princess
drives
capitally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
stay
as
you
were
,
''
said
Anna
,
coming
up
,
``
and
we
'll
go
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
''
and
taking
Dolly
's
arm
,
she
drew
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
eyes
were
fairly
dazzled
by
the
elegant
carriage
of
*NL*
a
pattern
she
had
never
seen
before
,
the
splendid
horses
,
and
the
*NL*
elegant
and
gorgeous
people
surrounding
her
.
But
what
struck
her
most
of
*NL*
all
was
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
Anna
,
whom
she
knew
so
well
*NL*
and
loved
.
Any
other
woman
,
a
less
close
observer
,
not
knowing
Anna
*NL*
before
,
or
not
having
thought
as
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
been
thinking
on
*NL*
the
road
,
would
not
have
noticed
anything
special
in
Anna
.
But
now
Dolly
*NL*
was
struck
by
that
temporary
beauty
,
which
is
only
found
in
women
during
*NL*
the
moments
of
love
,
and
which
she
saw
now
in
Anna
's
face
.
Everything
in
*NL*
her
face
,
the
clearly
marked
dimples
in
her
cheeks
and
chin
,
the
line
of
*NL*
her
lips
,
the
smile
which
,
as
it
were
,
fluttered
about
her
face
,
the
*NL*
brilliance
of
her
eyes
,
the
grace
and
rapidity
of
her
movements
,
the
*NL*
fulness
of
the
notes
of
her
voice
,
even
the
manner
in
which
,
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
angry
friendliness
,
she
answered
Veslovsky
when
he
asked
permission
*NL*
to
get
on
her
cob
,
so
as
to
teach
it
to
gallop
with
the
right
leg
*NL*
foremost
--
it
was
all
peculiarly
fascinating
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
*NL*
were
herself
aware
of
it
,
and
rejoicing
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
both
the
women
were
seated
in
the
carriage
,
a
sudden
embarrassment
*NL*
came
over
both
of
them
.
Anna
was
disconcerted
by
the
intent
look
of
*NL*
inquiry
Dolly
fixed
upon
her
.
Dolly
was
embarrassed
because
after
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
phrase
about
``
this
vehicle
,
''
she
could
not
help
feeling
*NL*
ashamed
of
the
dirty
old
carriage
in
which
Anna
was
sitting
with
her
.
*NL*
The
coachman
Philip
and
the
counting
house
clerk
were
experiencing
the
*NL*
same
sensation
.
The
counting
house
clerk
,
to
conceal
his
confusion
,
*NL*
busied
himself
settling
the
ladies
,
but
Philip
the
coachman
became
*NL*
sullen
,
and
was
bracing
himself
not
to
be
overawed
in
future
by
this
*NL*
external
superiority
.
He
smiled
ironically
,
looking
at
the
raven
horse
,
*NL*
and
was
already
deciding
in
his
own
mind
that
this
smart
trotter
in
the
*NL*
_
char-a-banc
_
was
only
good
for
_
promenade
_
,
and
would
n't
do
thirty
*NL*
miles
straight
off
in
the
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasants
had
all
got
up
from
the
cart
and
were
inquisitively
and
*NL*
mirthfully
staring
at
the
meeting
of
the
friends
,
making
their
comments
*NL*
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
pleased
,
too
;
have
n't
seen
each
other
for
a
long
while
,
''
said
*NL*
the
curly-headed
old
man
with
the
bast
round
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Uncle
Gerasim
,
if
we
could
take
that
raven
horse
now
,
to
cart
*NL*
the
corn
,
that

ud
be
quick
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look-ee

Is
that
a
woman
in
breeches
?
''
said
one
of
them
,
pointing
to
*NL*
Vassenka
Veslovsky
sitting
in
a
side
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
a
man
!
See
how
smartly
he
's
going
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

seems
we
're
not
going
to
sleep
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
chance
of
sleep
today
!
''
said
the
old
man
,
with
a
sidelong
look
at
*NL*
the
sun
.
``
Midday
's
past

look-ee

Get

*NL*
Anna
looked
at
Dolly
's
thin
,
care-worn
face
,
with
its
wrinkles
filled
*NL*
with
dust
from
the
road
,
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
what
she
was
*NL*
thinking
,
that
is
,
that
Dolly
had
got
thinner
.
But
,
conscious
that
she
*NL*
herself
had
grown
handsomer
,
and
that
Dolly
's
eyes
were
telling
her
so
,
*NL*
she
sighed
and
began
to
speak
about
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
looking
at
me
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
wondering
how
I
can
be
happy
in
*NL*
my
position
?
Well
!
it
's
shameful
to
confess
,
but
I
...
I
'm
inexcusably
*NL*
happy
.
Something
magical
has
happened
to
me
,
like
a
dream
,
when
you
're
*NL*
frightened
,
panic-stricken
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
wake
up
and
all
the
*NL*
horrors
are
no
more
.
I
have
waked
up
.
I
have
lived
through
the
misery
,
*NL*
the
dread
,
and
now
for
a
long
while
past
,
especially
since
we
've
been
*NL*
here
,
I
've
been
so
happy
!
...
''
she
said
,
with
a
timid
smile
of
inquiry
*NL*
looking
at
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
!
''
said
Dolly
smiling
,
involuntarily
speaking
more
coldly
*NL*
than
she
wanted
to
.
``
I
'm
very
glad
for
you
.
Why
have
n't
you
written
to
*NL*
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Because
I
had

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
wanted
to
express
her
thoughts
of
the
morning
,
but
*NL*
for
some
reason
it
seemed
to
her
now
out
of
place
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
of
that
we
'll
talk
later
.
What
's
this
,
what
are
all
these
*NL*
buildings
?
''
she
asked
,
wanting
to
change
the
conversation
and
pointing
*NL*
to
the
red
and
green
roofs
that
came
into
view
behind
the
green
hedges
*NL*
of
acacia
and
lilac
.
``
Quite
a
little
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anna
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
How
do
you
look
at
my
position
,
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider

''
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
beginning
,
but
at
that
instant
*NL*
Vassenka
Veslovsky
,
having
brought
the
cob
to
gallop
with
the
right
leg
*NL*
foremost
,
galloped
past
them
,
bumping
heavily
up
and
down
in
his
short
*NL*
jacket
on
the
chamois
leather
of
the
side
saddle
.
``
He
's
doing
it
,
Anna
*NL*
Arkadyevna
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
did
not
even
glance
at
him
;
but
again
it
seemed
to
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
out
of
place
to
enter
upon
such
a
long
conversation
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
and
so
she
cut
short
her
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
anything
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
I
always
loved
you

and
if
one
*NL*
loves
anyone

they

not
as
*NL*
one
would
like
them
to
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
taking
her
eyes
off
her
friend
's
face
and
dropping
her
eyelids
*NL*
-LRB-
this
was
a
new
habit
Dolly
had
not
seen
in
her
before
-RRB-
,
pondered
,
*NL*
trying
to
penetrate
the
full
significance
of
the
words
.
And
obviously
*NL*
interpreting
them
as
she
would
have
wished
,
she
glanced
at
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
any
sins
,
''
she
said
,
``
they
would
all
be
forgiven
you
for
*NL*
your
coming
to
see
me
and
these
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dolly
saw
that
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
.
She
pressed
Anna
's
hand
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
are
these
buildings
?
How
many
there
are
of
them
!
''
After
a
*NL*
moment
's
silence
she
repeated
her
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
are
the
servants
'
houses
,
barns
,
and
stables
,
''
answered
Anna
.
*NL*
``
And
there
the
park
begins
.
It
had
all
gone
to
ruin
,
but
Alexey
had
*NL*
everything
renewed
.
He
is
very
fond
of
this
place
,
and
,
what
I
never
*NL*
expected
,
he
has
become
intensely
interested
in
looking
after
it
.
But
*NL*
his
is
such
a
rich
nature
!
Whatever
he
takes
up
,
he
does
splendidly
.
So
*NL*
far
from
being
bored
by
it
,
he
works
with
passionate
interest
.
He
--
with
*NL*
his
temperament
as
I
know
it
--
he
has
become
careful
and
businesslike
,
a
*NL*
first-rate
manager
,
he
positively
reckons
every
penny
in
his
management
*NL*
of
the
land
.
But
only
in
that
.
When
it
's
a
question
of
tens
of
*NL*
thousands
,
he
does
n't
think
of
money
.
''
She
spoke
with
that
gleefully
sly
*NL*
smile
with
which
women
often
talk
of
the
secret
characteristics
only
*NL*
known
to
them
--
of
those
they
love
.
``
Do
you
see
that
big
building
?
that
's
*NL*
the
new
hospital
.
I
believe
it
will
cost
over
a
hundred
thousand
;
that
's
*NL*
his
hobby
just
now
.
And
do
you
know
how
it
all
came
about
?
The
peasants
*NL*
asked
him
for
some
meadowland
,
I
think
it
was
,
at
a
cheaper
rate
,
and
he
*NL*
refused
,
and
I
accused
him
of
being
miserly
.
Of
course
it
was
not
really
*NL*
because
of
that
,
but
everything
together
,
he
began
this
hospital
to
*NL*
prove
,
do
you
see
,
that
he
was
not
miserly
about
money
.
_
C'est
une
*NL*
petitesse
_
,
if
you
like
,
but
I
love
him
all
the
more
for
it
.
And
now
*NL*
you
'll
see
the
house
in
a
moment
.
It
was
his
grandfather
's
house
,
and
he
*NL*
has
had
nothing
changed
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
!
''
said
Dolly
,
looking
with
involuntary
admiration
at
the
*NL*
handsome
house
with
columns
,
standing
out
among
the
different-colored
*NL*
greens
of
the
old
trees
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
fine
?
And
from
the
house
,
from
the
top
,
the
view
is
*NL*
wonderful

*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
into
a
courtyard
strewn
with
gravel
and
bright
with
flowers
,
*NL*
in
which
two
laborers
were
at
work
putting
an
edging
of
stones
round
the
*NL*
light
mould
of
a
flower
bed
,
and
drew
up
in
a
covered
entry

*NL*
``
Ah

said
Anna

looking
at

horses
,
*NL*
which
were
just
being
led
away
from
the
steps
.
``
It
is
a
nice
horse
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
It
's
my
cob
;
my
favorite
.
Lead
him
here
and
bring
me
some
*NL*
sugar
.
Where
is
the
count
?
''
she
inquired
of
two
smart
footmen
who
darted
*NL*
out
.
``
Ah
,
there
he
is
!
''
she
said
,
seeing
Vronsky
coming
to
meet
her
with
*NL*
Veslovsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
to
put
the
princess
?
''
said
Vronsky
in
French
,
*NL*
addressing
Anna
,
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
,
he
once
more
greeted
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
and
this
time
he
kissed
her
hand
.
``
I
think
the
big
*NL*
balcony
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
that
's
too
far
off
!
Better
in
the
corner
room
,
we
shall
see
*NL*
each
other
more
.
Come
,
let
's
go
up
,
''
said
Anna
,
as
she
gave
her
favorite
*NL*
horse
the
sugar
the
footman
had
brought
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Et
vous
oubliez
votre
devoir
_
,
''
she
said
to
Veslovsky
,
who
came
out
*NL*
too
on
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Pardon
,
j'
en
ai
tout
plein
les
poches
_
,
''
he
answered
,
smiling
,
putting
*NL*
his
fingers
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Mais
vous
venez
trop
tard
_
,
''
she
said
,
rubbing
her
handkerchief
on
her
*NL*
hand
,
which
the
horse
had
made
wet
in
taking
the
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
turned
to
Dolly
.
``
You
can
stay
some
time
?
For
one
day
only
?
That
's
*NL*
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
be
back
,
and
the
children
...
''
said
Dolly
,
feeling
*NL*
embarrassed
both
because
she
had
to
get
her
bag
out
of
the
carriage
,
and
*NL*
because
she
knew
her
face
must
be
covered
with
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Dolly
,
darling
!
...
Well
,
we
'll
see
.
Come
along
,
come
along
!
''
and
*NL*
Anna
led
Dolly
to
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
room
was
not
the
smart
guest
chamber
Vronsky
had
suggested
,
but
the
*NL*
one
of
which
Anna
had
said
that
Dolly
would
excuse
it
.
And
this
room
,
*NL*
for
which
excuse
was
needed
,
was
more
full
of
luxury
than
any
in
which
*NL*
Dolly
had
ever
stayed
,
a
luxury
that
reminded
her
of
the
best
hotels
*NL*
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
darling
,
how
happy
I
am
!
''
Anna
said
,
sitting
down
in
her
riding
*NL*
habit
for
a
moment
beside
Dolly
.
``
Tell
me
about
all
of
you
.
Stiva
I
had
*NL*
only
a
glimpse
of
,
and
he
can
not
tell
one
about
the
children
.
How
is
my
*NL*
favorite
,
Tanya
?
Quite
a
big
girl
,
I
expect
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
's
very
tall
,
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
answered
shortly
,
surprised
*NL*
herself
that
she
should
respond
so
coolly
about
her
children
.
``
We
are
*NL*
having
a
delightful
stay
at
the
Levins
'
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
had
known
,
''
said
Anna
,
``
that
you
do
not
despise
me
!
...
You
*NL*
might
have
all
come
to
us
.
Stiva
's
an
old
friend
and
a
great
friend
of
*NL*
Alexey
's
,
you
know
,
''
she
added
,
and
suddenly
she
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
we
are
all
...
''
Dolly
answered
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
my
delight
I
'm
talking
nonsense
.
The
one
thing
,
darling
,
is
that
*NL*
I
am
so
glad
to
have
you
!
''
said
Anna
,
kissing
her
again
.
``
You
have
n't
*NL*
told
me
yet
how
and
what
you
think
about
me
,
and
I
keep
wanting
to
know
.
*NL*
But
I
'm
glad
you
will
see
me
as
I
am
.
The
chief
thing
I
should
n't
like
*NL*
would
be
for
people
to
imagine
I
want
to
prove
anything
.
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
prove
anything
;
I
merely
want
to
live
,
to
do
no
one
harm
but
myself
.
I
*NL*
have
the
right
to
do
that
,
have
n't
I
?
But
it
is
a
big
subject
,
and
we
'll
*NL*
talk
over
everything
properly
later
.
Now
I
'll
go
and
dress
and
send
a
*NL*
maid
to
you

Chapter
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
with
a
good
housewife
's
eye
,
scanned
her
*NL*
room
.
All
she
had
seen
in
entering
the
house
and
walking
through
it
,
and
*NL*
all
she
saw
now
in
her
room
,
gave
her
an
impression
of
wealth
and
*NL*
sumptuousness
and
of
that
modern
European
luxury
of
which
she
had
only
*NL*
read
in
English
novels
,
but
had
never
seen
in
Russia
and
in
the
country
.
*NL*
Everything
was
new
from
the
new
French
hangings
on
the
walls
to
the
*NL*
carpet
which
covered
the
whole
floor
.
The
bed
had
a
spring
mattress
,
and
*NL*
a
special
sort
of
bolster
and
silk
pillowcases
on
the
little
pillows
.
*NL*
The
marble
washstand
,
the
dressing
table
,
the
little
sofa
,
the
tables
,
*NL*
the
bronze
clock
on
the
chimney
piece
,
the
window
curtains
,
and
the
*NL*
_
portieres
_
were
all
new
and
expensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smart
maid
,
who
came
in
to
offer
her
services
,
with
her
hair
done
up
*NL*
high
,
and
a
gown
more
fashionable
than
Dolly
's
,
was
as
new
and
expensive
*NL*
as
the
whole
room
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
liked
her
neatness
,
her
*NL*
deferential
and
obliging
manners
,
but
she
felt
ill
at
ease
with
her
.
She
*NL*
felt
ashamed
of
her
seeing
the
patched
dressing
jacket
that
had
*NL*
unluckily
been
packed
by
mistake
for
her
.
She
was
ashamed
of
the
very
*NL*
patches
and
darned
places
of
which
she
had
been
so
proud
at
home
.
At
*NL*
home
it
had
been
so
clear
that
for
six
dressing
jackets
there
would
be
*NL*
needed
twenty-four
yards
of
nainsook
at
sixteen
pence
the
yard
,
which
*NL*
was
a
matter
of
thirty
shillings
besides
the
cutting-out
and
making
,
and
*NL*
these
thirty
shillings
had
been
saved
.
But
before
the
maid
she
felt
,
if
*NL*
not
exactly
ashamed
,
at
least
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
a
great
sense
of
relief
when
Annushka
,
whom
she
*NL*
had
known
for
years
,
walked
in
.
The
smart
maid
was
sent
for
to
go
to
her
*NL*
mistress
,
and
Annushka
remained
with
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annushka
was
obviously
much
pleased
at
that
lady
's
arrival
,
and
began
to
*NL*
chatter
away
without
a
pause
.
Dolly
observed
that
she
was
longing
to
*NL*
express
her
opinion
in
regard
to
her
mistress
's
position
,
especially
as
*NL*
to
the
love
and
devotion
of
the
count
to
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
but
Dolly
*NL*
carefully
interrupted
her
whenever
she
began
to
speak
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
grew
up
with
Anna
Arkadyevna
;
my
lady
's
dearer
to
me
than
anything
.
*NL*
Well
,
it
's
not
for
us
to
judge
.
And
,
to
be
sure
,
there
seems
so
much
*NL*
love
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kindly
pour
out
the
water
for
me
to
wash
now
,
please
,
''
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
cut
her
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
We
've
two
women
kept
specially
for
washing
small
things
,
but
*NL*
most
of
the
linen
's
done
by
machinery
.
The
count
goes
into
everything
*NL*
himself
.
Ah
,
what
a
husband
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
glad
when
Anna
came
in
,
and
by
her
entrance
put
a
stop
to
*NL*
Annushka
's
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
had
put
on
a
very
simple
batiste
gown
.
Dolly
scrutinized
that
*NL*
simple
gown
attentively
.
She
knew
what
it
meant
,
and
the
price
at
which
*NL*
such
simplicity
was
obtained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
friend
,
''
said
Anna
of
Annushka
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
was
not
embarrassed
now
.
She
was
perfectly
composed
and
at
ease
.
*NL*
Dolly
saw
that
she
had
now
completely
recovered
from
the
impression
her
*NL*
arrival
had
made
on
her
,
and
had
assumed
that
superficial
,
careless
tone
*NL*
which
,
as
it
were
,
closed
the
door
on
that
compartment
in
which
her
*NL*
deeper
feelings
and
ideas
were
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Anna
,
and
how
is
your
little
girl
?
''
asked
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
?
''
-LRB-
This
was
what
she
called
her
little
daughter
Anna
.
-RRB-
``
Very
*NL*
well
.
She
has
got
on
wonderfully
.
Would
you
like
to
see
her
?
Come
,
I
'll
*NL*
show
her
to
you
.
We
had
a
terrible
bother
,
''
she
began
telling
her
,
``
over
*NL*
nurses
.
We
had
an
Italian
wet-nurse
.
A
good
creature
,
but
so
stupid
!
We
*NL*
wanted
to
get
rid
of
her
,
but
the
baby
is
so
used
to
her
that
we
've
gone
*NL*
on
keeping
her
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
have
you
managed
?
...
''
Dolly
was
beginning
a
question
as
to
what
*NL*
name
the
little
girl
would
have
;
but
noticing
a
sudden
frown
on
Anna
's
*NL*
face
,
she
changed
the
drift
of
her
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
manage
?
have
you
weaned
her
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anna
had
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
mean
to
ask
that
?
You
meant
to
ask
about
her
surname
.
Yes
?
*NL*
That
worries
Alexey
.
She
has
no
name
--
that
is
,
she
's
a
Karenina
,
''
said
*NL*
Anna
,
dropping
her
eyelids
till
nothing
could
be
seen
but
the
eyelashes
*NL*
meeting
.
``
But
we
'll
talk
about
all
that
later
,
''
her
face
suddenly
*NL*
brightening
.
``
Come
,
I
'll
show
you
her
.
_
Elle
est
tres
gentille
_
.
She
*NL*
crawls
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
nursery
the
luxury
which
had
impressed
Dolly
in
the
whole
house
*NL*
struck
her
still
more
.
There
were
little
go-carts
ordered
from
England
,
*NL*
and
appliances
for
learning
to
walk
,
and
a
sofa
after
the
fashion
of
a
*NL*
billiard
table
,
purposely
constructed
for
crawling
,
and
swings
and
*NL*
baths
,
all
of
special
pattern
,
and
modern
.
They
were
all
English
,
solid
,
*NL*
and
of
good
make
,
and
obviously
very
expensive
.
The
room
was
large
,
and
*NL*
very
light
and
lofty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
went
in
,
the
baby
,
with
nothing
on
but
her
little
smock
,
was
*NL*
sitting
in
a
little
elbow
chair
at
the
table
,
having
her
dinner
of
*NL*
broth
,
which
she
was
spilling
all
over
her
little
chest
.
The
baby
was
*NL*
being
fed
,
and
the
Russian
nursery
maid
was
evidently
sharing
her
meal
.
*NL*
Neither
the
wet-nurse
nor
the
head
nurse
were
there
;
they
were
in
the
*NL*
next
room
,
from
which
came
the
sound
of
their
conversation
in
the
queer
*NL*
French
which
was
their
only
means
of
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
Anna
's
voice
,
a
smart
,
tall
,
English
nurse
with
a
disagreeable
*NL*
face
and
a
dissolute
expression
walked
in
at
the
door
,
hurriedly
shaking
*NL*
her
fair
curls
,
and
immediately
began
to
defend
herself
though
Anna
had
*NL*
not
found
fault
with
her
.
At
every
word
Anna
said
,
the
English
nurse
*NL*
said
hurriedly
several
times
,
``
Yes
,
my
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rosy
baby
with
her
black
eyebrows
and
hair
,
her
sturdy
red
little
*NL*
body
with
tight
goose-flesh
skin
,
delighted
Darya
Alexandrovna
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
cross
expression
with
which
she
stared
at
the
stranger
.
She
*NL*
positively
envied
the
baby
's
healthy
appearance
.
She
was
delighted
,
too
,
*NL*
at
the
baby
's
crawling
.
Not
one
of
her
own
children
had
crawled
like
*NL*
that
.
When
the
baby
was
put
on
the
carpet
and
its
little
dress
tucked
up
*NL*
behind
,
it
was
wonderfully
charming
.
Looking
round
like
some
little
wild
*NL*
animal
at
the
grown-up
big
people
with
her
bright
black
eyes
,
she
*NL*
smiled
,
unmistakably
pleased
at
their
admiring
her
,
and
holding
her
legs
*NL*
sideways
,
she
pressed
vigorously
on
her
arms
,
and
rapidly
drew
her
whole
*NL*
back
up
after
,
and
then
made
another
step
forward
with
her
little
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
nursery
,
and
especially
the
English
*NL*
nurse
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
did
not
like
at
all
.
It
was
only
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
no
good
nurse
would
have
entered
so
irregular
a
*NL*
household
as
Anna
's
that
Darya
Alexandrovna
could
explain
to
herself
how
*NL*
Anna
with
her
insight
into
people
could
take
such
an
unprepossessing
,
*NL*
disreputable-looking
woman
as
nurse
to
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
from
a
few
words
that
were
dropped
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
saw
at
*NL*
once
that
Anna
,
the
two
nurses
,
and
the
child
had
no
common
existence
,
*NL*
and
that
the
mother
's
visit
was
something
exceptional
.
Anna
wanted
to
*NL*
get
the
baby
her
plaything
,
and
could
not
find
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
amazing
of
all
was
the
fact
that
on
being
asked
how
many
teeth
the
*NL*
baby
had
,
Anna
answered
wrong
,
and
knew
nothing
about
the
two
last
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
feel
sorry
I
'm
so
superfluous
here
,
''
said
Anna
,
going
out
*NL*
of
the
nursery
and
holding
up
her
skirt
so
as
to
escape
the
plaything
*NL*
standing
in
the
doorway
.
``
It
was
very
different
with
my
first
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
it
to
be
the
other
way
,
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
By
the
way
,
do
you
know
I
saw
Seryozha
?
''
said
Anna
,
screwing
up
*NL*
her
eyes
,
as
though
looking
at
something
far
away
.
``
But
we
'll
talk
about
*NL*
that
later
.
You
would
n't
believe
it
,
I
'm
like
a
hungry
beggar
woman
when
*NL*
a
full
dinner
is
set
before
her
,
and
she
does
not
know
what
to
begin
on
*NL*
first
.
The
dinner
is
you
,
and
the
talks
I
have
before
me
with
you
,
which
*NL*
I
could
never
have
with
anyone
else
;
and
I
do
n't
know
which
subject
to
*NL*
begin
upon
first
.
_
Mais
je
ne
vous
ferai
grace
de
rien
_
.
I
must
have
*NL*
everything
out
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ought
to
give
you
a
sketch
of
the
company
you
will
meet
with
us
,
''
*NL*
she
went
on
.
``
I
'll
begin
with
the
ladies
.
Princess
Varvara
--
you
know
*NL*
her
,
and
I
know
your
opinion
and
Stiva
's
about
her
.
Stiva
says
the
whole
*NL*
aim
of
her
existence
is
to
prove
her
superiority
over
Auntie
Katerina
*NL*
Pavlovna
:
that
's
all
true
;
but
she
's
a
good-natured
woman
,
and
I
am
so
*NL*
grateful
to
her
.
In
Petersburg
there
was
a
moment
when
a
chaperon
was
*NL*
absolutely
essential
for
me
.
Then
she
turned
up
.
But
really
she
is
*NL*
good-natured
.
She
did
a
great
deal
to
alleviate
my
position
.
I
see
you
*NL*
do
n't
understand
all
the
difficulty
of
my
position
...
there
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
''
she
added
.
``
Here
I
'm
perfectly
at
ease
and
happy
.
Well
,
of
*NL*
that
later
on
,
though
.
Then
Sviazhsky
--
he
's
the
marshal
of
the
district
,
*NL*
and
he
's
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
but
he
wants
to
get
something
out
of
*NL*
Alexey
.
You
understand
,
with
his
property
,
now
that
we
are
settled
in
*NL*
the
country
,
Alexey
can
exercise
great
influence
.
Then
there
's
*NL*
Tushkevitch
--
you
have
seen
him
,
you
know
--
Betsy
's
admirer
.
Now
he
's
been
*NL*
thrown
over
and
he
's
come
to
see
us
.
As
Alexey
says
,
he
's
one
of
those
*NL*
people
who
are
very
pleasant
if
one
accepts
them
for
what
they
try
to
*NL*
appear
to
be
,
_
et
puis
il
est
comme
il
faut
_
,
as
Princess
Varvara
says
.
*NL*
Then
Veslovsky
...
you
know
him
.
A
very
nice
boy
,
''
she
said
,
and
a
sly
*NL*
smile
curved
her
lips
.
``
What
's
this
wild
story
about
him
and
the
Levins
?
*NL*
Veslovsky
told
Alexey
about
it
,
and
we
do
n't
believe
it
.
_
Il
est
tres
*NL*
gentil
et
naif
_
,
''
she
said
again
with
the
same
smile
.
``
Men
need
*NL*
occupation
,
and
Alexey
needs
a
circle
,
so
I
value
all
these
people
.
We
*NL*
have
to
have
the
house
lively
and
gay
,
so
that
Alexey
may
not
long
for
*NL*
any
novelty
.
Then
you
'll
see
the
steward
--
a
German
,
a
very
good
fellow
,
*NL*
and
he
understands
his
work
.
Alexey
has
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
.
Then
*NL*
the
doctor
,
a
young
man
,
not
quite
a
Nihilist
perhaps
,
but
you
know
,
*NL*
eats
with
his
knife
...
but
a
very
good
doctor
.
Then
the
architect
...

``
Here
's
Dolly
for
you
,
princess
,
you
were
so
anxious
to
see
her
,
''
said
*NL*
Anna
,
coming
out
with
Darya
Alexandrovna
onto
the
stone
terrace
where
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
was
sitting
in
the
shade
at
an
embroidery
frame
,
*NL*
working
at
a
cover
for
Count
Alexey
Kirillovitch
's
easy
chair
.
``
She
says
*NL*
she
does
n't
want
anything
before
dinner
,
but
please
order
some
lunch
for
*NL*
her
,
and
I
'll
go
and
look
for
Alexey
and
bring
them
all
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
gave
Dolly
a
cordial
and
rather
patronizing
reception
,
*NL*
and
began
at
once
explaining
to
her
that
she
was
living
with
Anna
*NL*
because
she
had
always
cared
more
for
her
than
her
sister
Katerina
*NL*
Pavlovna
,
the
aunt
that
had
brought
Anna
up
,
and
that
now
,
when
every
*NL*
one
had
abandoned
Anna
,
she
thought
it
her
duty
to
help
her
in
this
most
*NL*
difficult
period
of
transition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
husband
will
give
her
a
divorce
,
and
then
I
shall
go
back
to
my
*NL*
solitude
;
but
now
I
can
be
of
use
,
and
I
am
doing
my
duty
,
however
*NL*
difficult
it
may
be
for
me
--
not
like
some
other
people
.
And
how
sweet
it
*NL*
is
of
you
,
how
right
of
you
to
have
come
!
They
live
like
the
best
of
*NL*
married
couples
;
it
's
for
God
to
judge
them
,
not
for
us
.
And
did
n't
*NL*
Biryuzovsky
and
Madame
Avenieva
...
and
Sam
Nikandrov
,
and
Vassiliev
and
*NL*
Madame
Mamonova
,
and
Liza
Neptunova
...
Did
no
one
say
anything
about
*NL*
them
?
And
it
has
ended
by
their
being
received
by
everyone
.
And
then
,
*NL*

_
Everyone
does
*NL*
as
he
pleases
till

Dinner
at
seven
o'clock
.
Stiva
did
very
*NL*
rightly
to
send
you
.
He
needs
their
support
.
You
know
that
through
his
*NL*
mother
and
brother
he
can
do
anything

And
then
they
do
so
much
good
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
tell
you
about
his
hospital
?

''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
Anna
,
who
had
found
the
men
of
the
*NL*
party
in
the
billiard
room
,
and
returned
with
them
to
the
terrace
.
There
*NL*
was
still
a
long
time
before
the
dinner-hour
,
it
was
exquisite
weather
,
*NL*
and
so
several
different
methods
of
spending
the
next
two
hours
were
*NL*
proposed
.
There
were
very
many
methods
of
passing
the
time
at
*NL*
Vozdvizhenskoe
,
and
these
were
all
unlike
those
in
use
at
Pokrovskoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Une
partie
de
lawn-tennis
,
_
''
Veslovsky
proposed
,
with
his
handsome
*NL*
smile
.
``
We
'll
be
partners
again
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
too
hot
;
better
stroll
about
the
garden
and
have
a
row
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
show
Darya
Alexandrovna
the
river
banks
.
''
Vronsky
proposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
to
anything
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
that
what
Dolly
would
like
best
would
be
a
stroll
--
would
n't
*NL*
you
?
And
then
the
boat
,
perhaps
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
decided
.
Veslovsky
and
Tushkevitch
went
off
to
the
bathing
*NL*
place
,
promising
to
get
the
boat
ready
and
to
wait
there
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
the
path
in
two
couples
,
Anna
with
Sviazhsky
,
and
*NL*
Dolly
with
Vronsky
.
Dolly
was
a
little
embarrassed
and
anxious
in
the
*NL*
new
surroundings
in
which
she
found
herself
.
Abstractly
,
theoretically
,
*NL*
she
did
not
merely
justify
,
she
positively
approved
of
Anna
's
conduct
.
*NL*
As
is
indeed
not
unfrequent
with
women
of
unimpeachable
virtue
,
weary
of
*NL*
the
monotony
of
respectable
existence
,
at
a
distance
she
not
only
*NL*
excused
illicit
love
,
she
positively
envied
it
.
Besides
,
she
loved
Anna
*NL*
with
all
her
heart
.
But
seeing
Anna
in
actual
life
among
these
*NL*
strangers
,
with
this
fashionable
tone
that
was
so
new
to
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
she
felt
ill
at
ease
.
What
she
disliked
particularly
was
*NL*
seeing
Princess
Varvara
ready
to
overlook
everything
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
comforts
she
enjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
general
principle
,
abstractly
,
Dolly
approved
of
Anna
's
action
;
but
*NL*
to
see
the
man
for
whose
sake
her
action
had
been
taken
was
disagreeable
*NL*
to
her
.
Moreover
,
she
had
never
liked
Vronsky
.
She
thought
him
very
*NL*
proud
,
and
saw
nothing
in
him
of
which
he
could
be
proud
except
his
*NL*
wealth
.
But
against
her
own
will
,
here
in
his
own
house
,
he
overawed
her
*NL*
more
than
ever
,
and
she
could
not
be
at
ease
with
him
.
She
felt
with
him
*NL*
the
same
feeling
she
had
had
with
the
maid
about
her
dressing
jacket
.
*NL*
Just
as
with
the
maid
she
had
felt
not
exactly
ashamed
,
but
embarrassed
*NL*
at
her
darns
,
so
she
felt
with
him
not
exactly
ashamed
,
but
embarrassed
*NL*
at
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
was
ill
at
ease
,
and
tried
to
find
a
subject
of
conversation
.
Even
*NL*
though
she
supposed
that
,
through
his
pride
,
praise
of
his
house
and
*NL*
garden
would
be
sure
to
be
disagreeable
to
him
,
she
did
all
the
same
*NL*
tell
him
how
much
she
liked
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
very
fine
building
,
and
in
the
good
old-fashioned
style
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
so
much
the
court
in
front
of
the
steps
.
Was
that
always
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
he
said
,
and
his
face
beamed
with
pleasure
.
``
If
you
could
only
*NL*
have
seen
that
court
last
spring
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
,
at
first
rather
diffidently
,
but
more
and
more
carried
*NL*
away
by
the
subject
as
he
went
on
,
to
draw
her
attention
to
the
various
*NL*
details
of
the
decoration
of
his
house
and
garden
.
It
was
evident
that
,
*NL*
having
devoted
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
improve
and
beautify
his
home
,
*NL*
Vronsky
felt
a
need
to
show
off
the
improvements
to
a
new
person
,
and
*NL*
was
genuinely
delighted
at
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
care
to
look
at
the
hospital
,
and
are
not
tired
,
indeed
,
*NL*
it
's
not
far
.
Shall
we
go
?
''
he
said
,
glancing
into
her
face
to
convince
*NL*
himself
that
she
was
not
bored
.
``
Are
you
coming
,
Anna
?
''
he
turned
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
come
,
wo
n't
we
?
''
she
said
,
addressing
Sviazhsky
.
''
_
Mais

ne
*NL*

et
Tushkevitch

_
We
must
send
and
tell
them

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
this
is
a
monument
he
is
setting
up
here
,
''
said
Anna
,
turning
to
*NL*
Dolly
with
that
sly
smile
of
comprehension
with
which
she
had
previously
*NL*
talked
about
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
work
of
real
importance
!
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
But
to
show
he
was
*NL*
not
trying
to
ingratiate
himself
with
Vronsky
,
he
promptly
added
some
*NL*
slightly
critical
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
though
,
count
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
while
you
do
so
much
for
the
*NL*
health
of
the
peasants
,
you
take
so
little
interest
in
the
schools
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
C'est
devenu
tellement
commun

ecoles
,
_
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
You
*NL*
understand
it
's
not
on
that
account
,
but
it
just
happens
so
,
my
interest
*NL*
has
been
diverted
elsewhere
.
This
way
then
to
the
hospital
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
pointing
to
a
turning
out
of
the
avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
put
up
their
parasols
and
turned
into
the
side
path
.
After
*NL*
going
down
several
turnings
,
and
going
through
a
little
gate
,
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
saw
standing
on
rising
ground
before
her
a
large
*NL*
pretentious-looking
red
building
,
almost
finished
.
The
iron
roof
,
which
*NL*
was
not
yet
painted
,
shone
with
dazzling
brightness
in
the
sunshine
.
*NL*
Beside
the
finished
building
another
had
been
begun
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
scaffolding
.
Workmen
in
aprons
,
standing
on
scaffolds
,
were
laying
*NL*
bricks
,
pouring
mortar
out
of
vats
,
and
smoothing
it
with
trowels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
quickly
work
gets
done
with
you
!
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
``
When
I
was
here
*NL*
last
time
the
roof
was
not
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
autumn
it
will
all
be
ready
.
Inside
almost
everything
is
done
,
''
*NL*
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
's
this
new
building
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
house
for
the
doctor
and
the
dispensary
,
''
answered
Vronsky
,
*NL*
seeing
the
architect
in
a
short
jacket
coming
towards
him
;
and
excusing
*NL*
himself
to
the
ladies
,
he
went
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
round
a
hole
where
the
workmen
were
slaking
lime
,
he
stood
still
*NL*
with
the
architect
and
began
talking
rather
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
front
is
still
too
low
,
''
he
said
to
Anna
,
who
had
asked
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
the
foundation
ought
to
be
raised
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
it
would
have
been
much
better
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
said
*NL*
the
architect
,
``
but
now
it
's
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
take
a
great
interest
in
it
,
''
Anna
answered
Sviazhsky
,
who
was
*NL*
expressing
his
surprise
at
her
knowledge
of
architecture
.
``
This
new
*NL*
building
ought
to
have
been
in
harmony
with
the
hospital
.
It
was
an
*NL*
afterthought
,
and
was
begun
without
a
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
,
having
finished
his
talk
with
the
architect
,
joined
the
ladies
,
*NL*
and
led
them
inside
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
they
were
still
at
work
on
the
cornices
outside
and
were
*NL*
painting
on
the
ground
floor
,
upstairs
almost
all
the
rooms
were
*NL*
finished
.
Going
up
the
broad
cast-iron
staircase
to
the
landing
,
they
*NL*
walked
into
the
first
large
room
.
The
walls
were
stuccoed
to
look
like
*NL*
marble
,
the
huge
plate-glass
windows
were
already
in
,
only
the
parquet
*NL*
floor
was
not
yet
finished
,
and
the
carpenters
,
who
were
planing
a
block
*NL*
of
it
,
left
their
work
,
taking
off
the
bands
that
fastened
their
hair
,
*NL*
to
greet
the
gentry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
reception
room
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
Here
there
will
be
a
desk
,
*NL*
tables
,
and
benches
,
and
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
;
let
us
go
in
here
.
Do
n't
go
near
the
window
,
''
said
Anna
,
*NL*
trying
the
paint
to
see
if
it
were
dry
.
``
Alexey
,
the
paint
's
dry
*NL*
already
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
reception
room
they
went
into
the
corridor
.
Here
Vronsky
showed
*NL*
them
the
mechanism
for
ventilation
on
a
novel
system
.
Then
he
showed
*NL*
them
marble
baths
,
and
beds
with
extraordinary
springs
.
Then
he
showed
*NL*
them
the
wards
one
after
another
,
the
storeroom
,
the
linen
room
,
then
*NL*
the
heating
stove
of
a
new
pattern
,
then
the
trolleys
,
which
would
make
*NL*
no
noise
as
they
carried
everything
needed
along
the
corridors
,
and
many
*NL*
other
things
.
Sviazhsky
,
as
a
connoisseur
in
the
latest
mechanical
*NL*
improvements
,
appreciated
everything
fully
.
Dolly
simply
wondered
at
all
*NL*
she
had
not
seen
before
,
and
,
anxious
to
understand
it
all
,
made
minute
*NL*
inquiries
about
everything
,
which
gave
Vronsky
great
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
imagine
that
this
will
be
the
solitary
example
of
a
properly
*NL*
fitted
hospital
in
Russia
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wo
n't
you
have
a
lying-in
ward
?
''
asked
Dolly
.
``
That
's
so
much
*NL*
needed
in
the
country
.
I
have
often
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
usual
courtesy
,
Vronsky
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
a
lying-in
home
,
but
a
hospital
for
the
sick
,
and
is
*NL*
intended
for
all
diseases
,
except
infectious
complaints
,
''
he
said
.
``
Ah
!
*NL*
look
at
this
,
''
and
he
rolled
up
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
an
invalid
chair
*NL*
that
had
just
been
ordered
for
the
convalescents
.
``
Look
.
''
He
sat
down
in
*NL*
the
chair
and
began
moving
it
.
``
The
patient
ca
n't
walk
--
still
too
weak
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
or
something
wrong
with
his
legs
,
but
he
must
have
air
,
and
he
*NL*
moves
,
rolls
himself
along
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
interested
by
everything
.
She
liked
everything
*NL*
very
much
,
but
most
of
all
she
liked
Vronsky
himself
with
his
natural
,
*NL*
simple-hearted
eagerness
.
``
Yes
,
he
's
a
very
nice
,
good
man
,
''
she
thought
*NL*
several
times
,
not
hearing
what
he
said
,
but
looking
at
him
and
*NL*
penetrating
into
his
expression
,
while
she
mentally
put
herself
in
*NL*
Anna
's
place
.
She
liked
him
so
much
just
now
with
his
eager
interest
*NL*
that
she
saw
how
Anna
could
be
in
love
with
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
the
princess
is
tired
,
and
horses
do
n't
interest
her
,
''
*NL*
Vronsky
said
to
Anna
,
who
wanted
to
go
on
to
the
stables
,
where
*NL*
Sviazhsky
wished
to
see
the
new
stallion
.
``
You
go
on
,
while
I
escort
the
*NL*
princess
home
,
and
we
'll
have
a
little
talk
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
would
*NL*
like
that
?
''
he
added
,
turning
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
horses
,
and
I
shall
be
delighted
,
''
answered
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
rather
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
by
Vronsky
's
face
that
he
wanted
something
from
her
.
She
was
not
*NL*
mistaken
.
As
soon
as
they
had
passed
through
the
little
gate
back
into
*NL*
the
garden
,
he
looked
in
the
direction
Anna
had
taken
,
and
having
made
*NL*
sure
that
she
could
neither
hear
nor
see
them
,
he
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
guess
that
I
have
something
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
looking
*NL*
at
her
with
laughing
eyes
.
``
I
am
not
wrong
in
believing
you
to
be
a
*NL*
friend
of
Anna
's
.
''
He
took
off
his
hat
,
and
taking
out
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
wiped
his
head
,
which
was
growing
bald
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
made
no
answer
,
and
merely
stared
at
him
with
dismay
.
*NL*
When
she
was
left
alone
with
him
,
she
suddenly
felt
afraid
;
his
laughing
*NL*
eyes
and
stern
expression
scared
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
diverse
suppositions
as
to
what
he
was
about
to
speak
of
to
her
*NL*
flashed
into
her
brain
.
``
He
is
going
to
beg
me
to
come
to
stay
with
them
*NL*
with
the
children
,
and
I
shall
have
to
refuse
;
or
to
create
a
set
that
*NL*
will
receive
Anna
in
Moscow
...
Or
is
n't
it
Vassenka
Veslovsky
and
his
*NL*
relations
with
Anna
?
Or
perhaps
about
Kitty
,
that
he
feels
he
was
to
*NL*
blame
?
''
All
her
conjectures
were
unpleasant
,
but
she
did
not
guess
what
*NL*
he
really
wanted
to
talk
about
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
so
much
influence
with
Anna
,
she
is
so
fond
of
you
,
''
he
said
;
*NL*
``
do
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
looked
with
timid
inquiry
into
his
energetic
face
,
*NL*
which
under
the
lime-trees
was
continually
being
lighted
up
in
patches
*NL*
by
the
sunshine
,
and
then
passing
into
complete
shadow
again
.
She
waited
*NL*
for
him
to
say
more
,
but
he
walked
in
silence
beside
her
,
scratching
*NL*
with
his
cane
in
the
gravel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
come
to
see
us
,
you
,
the
only
woman
of
Anna
's
former
*NL*
friends
--
I
do
n't
count
Princess
Varvara
--
but
I
know
that
you
have
done
*NL*
this
not
because
you
regard
our
position
as
normal
,
but
because
,
*NL*
understanding
all
the
difficulty
of
the
position
,
you
still
love
her
and
*NL*
want
to
be
a
help
to
her
.
Have
I
understood
you
rightly
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
looking
round
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
answered
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
putting
down
her
sunshade
,
*NL*
``
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
broke
in
,
and
unconsciously
,
oblivious
of
the
awkward
position
*NL*
into
which
he
was
putting
his
companion
,
he
stopped
abruptly
,
so
that
*NL*
she
had
to
stop
short
too
.
``
No
one
feels
more
deeply
and
intensely
than
*NL*
I
do
all
the
difficulty
of
Anna
's
position
;
and
that
you
may
well
*NL*
understand
,
if
you
do
me
the
honor
of
supposing
I
have
any
heart
.
I
am
*NL*
to
blame
for
that
position
,
and
that
is
why
I
feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
involuntarily
admiring
the
*NL*
sincerity
and
firmness
with
which
he
said
this
.
``
But
just
because
you
*NL*
feel
yourself
responsible
,
you
exaggerate
it
,
I
am
afraid
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
Her
position
in
the
world
is
difficult
,
I
can
well
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
world
it
is
hell
!
''
he
brought
out
quickly
,
frowning
darkly
.
``
You
*NL*
ca
n't
imagine
moral
sufferings
greater
than
what
she
went
through
in
*NL*
Petersburg
in
that
fortnight
...
and
I
beg
you
to
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
here
,
so
long
as
neither
Anna
...
nor
you
miss
society
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Society
!
''
he
said
contemptuously
,
``
how
could
I
miss
society
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
--
and
it
may
be
so
always
--
you
are
happy
and
at
peace
.
I
see
in
*NL*
Anna
that
she
is
happy
,
perfectly
happy
,
she
has
had
time
to
tell
me
so
*NL*
much
already
,
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
smiling
;
and
involuntarily
,
as
*NL*
she
said
this
,
at
the
same
moment
a
doubt
entered
her
mind
whether
Anna
*NL*
really
were
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Vronsky
,
it
appeared
,
had
no
doubts
on
that
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
know
that
she
has
revived
after
all
her
*NL*
sufferings
;
she
is
happy
.
She
is
happy
in
the
present
.
But
I
?
...
I
am
*NL*
afraid
of
what
is
before
us
...
I
beg
your
pardon
,
you
would
like
to
*NL*
walk
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
let
us
sit
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
sat
down
on
a
garden
seat
in
a
corner
of
the
avenue
.
*NL*
He
stood
up
facing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
she
is
happy
,
''
he
repeated
,
and
the
doubt
whether
she
were
*NL*
happy
sank
more
deeply
into
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
mind
.
``
But
can
it
last
?
*NL*
Whether
we
have
acted
rightly
or
wrongly
is
another
question
,
but
the
*NL*
die
is
cast
,
''
he
said
,
passing
from
Russian
to
French
,
``
and
we
are
bound
*NL*
together
for
life
.
We
are
united
by
all
the
ties
of
love
that
we
hold
*NL*
most
sacred
.
We
have
a
child
,
we
may
have
other
children
.
But
the
law
*NL*
and
all
the
conditions
of
our
position
are
such
that
thousands
of
*NL*
complications
arise
which
she
does
not
see
and
does
not
want
to
see
.
And
*NL*
that
one
can
well
understand
.
But
I
ca
n't
help
seeing
them
.
My
daughter
*NL*
is
by
law
not
my
daughter
,
but
Karenin
's
.
I
can
not
bear
this
falsity
!
''
*NL*
he
said
,
with
a
vigorous
gesture
of
refusal
,
and
he
looked
with
gloomy
*NL*
inquiry
towards
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
,
but
simply
gazed
at
him
.
He
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
a
son
may
be
born
,
my
son
,
and
he
will
be
legally
a
Karenin
;
he
*NL*
will
not
be
the
heir
of
my
name
nor
of
my
property
,
and
however
happy
we
*NL*
may
be
in
our
home
life
and
however
many
children
we
may
have
,
there
*NL*
will
be
no
real
tie
between
us
.
They
will
be
Karenins
.
You
can
*NL*
understand
the
bitterness
and
horror
of
this
position
!
I
have
tried
to
*NL*
speak
of
this
to
Anna
.
It
irritates
her
.
She
does
not
understand
,
and
to
*NL*
her
I
can
not
speak
plainly
of
all
this
.
Now
look
at
another
side
.
I
am
*NL*
happy
,
happy
in
her
love
,
but
I
must
have
occupation
.
I
have
found
*NL*
occupation
,
and
am
proud
of
what
I
am
doing
and
consider
it
nobler
than
*NL*
the
pursuits
of
my
former
companions
at
court
and
in
the
army
.
And
most
*NL*
certainly
I
would
not
change
the
work
I
am
doing
for
theirs
.
I
am
*NL*
working
here
,
settled
in
my
own
place
,
and
I
am
happy
and
contented
,
and
*NL*
we
need
nothing
more
to
make
us
happy

I
love
my
work
here

on

''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
noticed
that
at
this
point
in
his
explanation
he
grew
*NL*
confused
,
and
she
did
not
quite
understand
this
digression
,
but
she
felt
*NL*
that
having
once
begun
to
speak
of
matters
near
his
heart
,
of
which
he
*NL*
could
not
speak
to
Anna
,
he
was
now
making
a
clean
breast
of
everything
,
*NL*
and
that
the
question
of
his
pursuits
in
the
country
fell
into
the
same
*NL*
category
of
matters
near
his
heart
,
as
the
question
of
his
relations
*NL*
with
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
go
on
,
''
he
said
,
collecting
himself
.
``
The
great
thing
is
*NL*
that
as
I
work
I
want
to
have
a
conviction

what
I

not
*NL*
die
with
me
,
that
I
shall
have
heirs
to
come
after
me
,

and
this
I
have
*NL*
not
.
Conceive
the
position
of
a
man
who
knows
that
his
children
,
the
*NL*
children
of
the
woman
he
loves
,
will
not
be
his
,
but
will
belong
to
*NL*
someone
who
hates
them
and
cares
nothing
about
them
!
It
is
awful
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
evidently
much
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
I
see
that
.
But
what
can
Anna
do
?
''
queried
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
brings
me
to
the
object

my
conversation

he
said
,
calming
*NL*
himself
with
an
effort
.
``
Anna
can
,
it
depends
on
her

Even
to
*NL*
petition
the
Tsar
for
legitimization

a
divorce
is
essential

And
that
*NL*
depends
on
Anna

Her
husband
agreed
to
a
divorce

at

your
*NL*
husband
had
arranged
it
completely

And
now
,
I
know
,
he
would
not
refuse
*NL*
it
.
It
is
only
a
matter
of
writing
to
him

He
said
plainly
at
that
time
*NL*
that
if
she
expressed
the
desire
,
he
would
not
refuse
.
Of
course

he
*NL*
said
gloomily
,
``
it
is
one
of
those
Pharisaical
cruelties

only
*NL*
such
heartless
men

capable

He

what
agony
any
recollection
of

him
must
give
her

and
knowing

he
must
have
a
letter
from

I
*NL*
can
understand
that
it

agony

her

But
the
matter
is
of
such

,
very
hard
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
with
an
expression
as
though
he
were
threatening
someone
for
*NL*
its
being
hard
for
him
.
``
And
so
it
is
,
princess
,
that
I
am
shamelessly
*NL*
clutching
at
you
as
an
anchor
of
salvation
.
Help
me
to
persuade
her
to
*NL*
write
to
him
and
ask
for
a
divorce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
said
dreamily
,
as
she
vividly
*NL*
recalled
her
last
interview
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
Yes
,
of
*NL*
course
,
''
she
repeated
with
decision
,
thinking
of
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Use
your
influence
with
her
,
make
her
write
.
I
do
n't
like
--
I
'm
almost
*NL*
unable
to
speak
about
this
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
will
talk
to
her
.
But
how
is
it
she
does
not
think
of
it
*NL*
herself
?
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
and
for
some
reason
she
suddenly
at
*NL*
that
point
recalled
Anna
's
strange
new
habit
of
half-closing
her
eyes
.
*NL*
And
she
remembered
that
Anna
drooped
her
eyelids
just
when
the
deeper
*NL*
questions
of
life
were
touched
upon
.
``
Just
as
though
she
half-shut
her
*NL*
eyes
to
her
own
life
,
so
as
not
to
see
everything
,
''
thought
Dolly
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
for
my
own
sake
and
for
hers
I
will
talk
to
her
,
''
Dolly
said
in
*NL*
reply
to
his
look
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
up
and
walked
to
the
house
.

*NL*
Chapter
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anna
found
Dolly
at
home
before
her
,
she
looked
intently
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
as
though
questioning
her
about
the
talk
she
had
had
with
Vronsky
,
*NL*
but
she
made
no
inquiry
in
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
it
's
dinner
time
,
''
she
said
.
``
We
've
not
seen
each
other
at
*NL*
all
yet
.
I
am
reckoning
on
the
evening
.
Now
I
want
to
go
and
dress
.
I
*NL*
expect
you
do
too
;
we
all
got
splashed
at
the
buildings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
went
to
her
room
and
she
felt
amused
.
To
change
her
dress
was
*NL*
impossible
,
for
she
had
already
put
on
her
best
dress
.
But
in
order
to
*NL*
signify
in
some
way
her
preparation
for
dinner
,
she
asked
the
maid
to
*NL*
brush
her
dress
,
changed
her
cuffs
and
tie
,
and
put
some
lace
on
her
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
I
can
do
,
''
she
said
with
a
smile
to
Anna
,
who
came
in
to
*NL*
her
in
a
third
dress
,
again
of
extreme
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
are
too
formal
here
,
''
she
said
,
as
it
were
apologizing
for
her
*NL*
magnificence
.
``
Alexey
is
delighted
at
your
visit
,
as
he
rarely
is
at
*NL*
anything
.
He
has
completely
lost
his
heart
to
you
,
''
she
added
.
``
You
're
*NL*
not
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
time
for
talking
about
anything
before
dinner
.
Going
into
*NL*
the
drawing
room
they
found
Princess
Varvara
already
there
,
and
the
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
party
in
black
frock-coats
.
The
architect
wore
a
*NL*
swallow-tail
coat
.
Vronsky
presented
the
doctor
and
the
steward
to
his
*NL*
guest
.
The
architect
he
had
already
introduced
to
her
at
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stout
butler
,
resplendent
with
a
smoothly
shaven
round
chin
and
a
*NL*
starched
white
cravat
,
announced
that
dinner
was
ready
,
and
the
ladies
*NL*
got
up
.
Vronsky
asked
Sviazhsky
to
take
in
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
and
himself
*NL*
offered
his
arm
to
Dolly
.
Veslovsky
was
before
Tushkevitch
in
offering
*NL*
his
arm
to
Princess
Varvara
,
so
that
Tushkevitch
with
the
steward
and
*NL*
the
doctor
walked
in
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
,
the
dining
room
,
the
service
,
the
waiting
at
table
,
the
*NL*
wine
,
and
the
food
,
were
not
simply
in
keeping
with
the
general
tone
of
*NL*
modern
luxury
throughout
all
the
house
,
but
seemed
even
more
sumptuous
*NL*
and
modern
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
watched
this
luxury
which
was
novel
to
*NL*
her
,
and
as
a
good
housekeeper
used
to
managing
a
household
--
although
*NL*
she
never
dreamed
of
adapting
anything
she
saw
to
her
own
household
,
as
*NL*
it
was
all
in
a
style
of
luxury
far
above
her
own
manner
of
living
--
she
*NL*
could
not
help
scrutinizing
every
detail
,
and
wondering
how
and
by
whom
*NL*
it
was
all
done
.
Vassenka
Veslovsky
,
her
husband
,
and
even
Sviazhsky
,
*NL*
and
many
other
people
she
knew
,
would
never
have
considered
this
*NL*
question
,
and
would
have
readily
believed
what
every
well-bred
host
*NL*
tries
to
make
his
guests
feel
,
that
is
,
that
all
that
is
well-ordered
in
*NL*
his
house
has
cost
him
,
the
host
,
no
trouble
whatever
,
but
comes
of
*NL*
itself
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
well
aware
that
even
porridge
for
the
*NL*
children
's
breakfast
does
not
come
of
itself
,
and
that
therefore
,
where
*NL*
so
complicated
and
magnificent
a
style
of
luxury
was
maintained
,
someone
*NL*
must
give
earnest
attention
to
its
organization
.
And
from
the
glance
*NL*
with
which
Alexey
Kirillovitch
scanned
the
table
,
from
the
way
he
nodded
*NL*
to
the
butler
,
and
offered
Darya
Alexandrovna
her
choice
between
cold
*NL*
soup
and
hot
soup
,
she
saw
that
it
was
all
organized
and
maintained
by
*NL*
the
care
of
the
master
of
the
house
himself
.
It
was
evident
that
it
all
*NL*
rested
no
more
upon
Anna
than
upon
Veslovsky
.
She
,
Sviazhsky
,
the
*NL*
princess
,
and
Veslovsky
,
were
equally
guests
,
with
light
hearts
enjoying
*NL*
what
had
been
arranged
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
was
the
hostess
only
in
conducting
the
conversation
.
The
*NL*
conversation
was
a
difficult
one
for
the
lady
of
the
house
at
a
small
*NL*
table
with
persons
present
,
like
the
steward
and
the
architect
,
*NL*
belonging
to
a
completely
different
world
,
struggling
not
to
be
overawed
*NL*
by
an
elegance
to
which
they
were
unaccustomed
,
and
unable
to
sustain
a
*NL*
large
share
in
the
general
conversation
.
But
this
difficult
conversation
*NL*
Anna
directed
with
her
usual
tact
and
naturalness
,
and
indeed
she
did
so
*NL*
with
actual
enjoyment
,
as
Darya
Alexandrovna
observed
.
The
conversation
*NL*
began
about
the
row
Tushkevitch
and
Veslovsky
had
taken
alone
together
*NL*
in
the
boat
,
and
Tushkevitch
began
describing
the
last
boat
races
in
*NL*
Petersburg
at
the
Yacht
Club
.
But
Anna
,
seizing
the
first
pause
,
at
once
*NL*
turned
to
the
architect
to
draw
him
out
of
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nikolay
Ivanitch
was
struck
,
''
she
said
,
meaning
Sviazhsky
,
``
at
the
*NL*
progress
the
new
building
had
made
since
he
was
here
last
;
but
I
am
*NL*
there
every
day
,
and
every
day
I
wonder
at
the
rate
at
which
it
grows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
first-rate
working
with
his
excellency
,
''
said
the
architect
with
a
*NL*
smile
-LRB-
he
was
respectful
and
composed
,
though
with
a
sense
of
his
own
*NL*
dignity
-RRB-
.
``
It
's
a
very
different
matter
to
have
to
do
with
the
district
*NL*
authorities
.
Where
one
would
have
to
write
out
sheaves
of
papers
,
here
I
*NL*
call
upon
the
count
,
and
in
three
words
we
settle
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
American
way
of
doing
business
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
,
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
they
build
in
a
rational
fashion
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
passed
to
the
misuse
of
political
power
in
the
United
*NL*
States
,
but
Anna
quickly
brought
it
round
to
another
topic
,
so
as
to
*NL*
draw
the
steward
into
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
a
reaping
machine
?
''
she
said
,
addressing
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
.
``
We
had
just
ridden
over
to
look
at
one
when
we
met
.
It
's
*NL*
the
first
time
I
ever
saw
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
they
work
?
''
asked
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
like
little
scissors
.
A
plank
and
a
lot
of
little
scissors
.
*NL*
Like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
took
a
knife
and
fork
in
her
beautiful
white
hands
covered
with
*NL*
rings
,
and
began
showing
how
the
machine
worked
.
It
was
clear
that
she
*NL*
saw
nothing
would
be
understood
from
her
explanation
;
but
aware
that
her
*NL*
talk
was
pleasant
and
her
hands
beautiful
she
went
on
explaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
like
little
penknives
,
''
Veslovsky
said
playfully
,
never
taking
his
*NL*
eyes
off
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
gave
a
just
perceptible
smile
,
but
made
no
answer
.
``
Is
n't
it
true
,
*NL*
Karl
Fedoritch
,
that
it
's
just
like
little
scissors
?
''
she
said
to
the
*NL*
steward
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Oh
,
ja
,
_
''
answered
the
German
.
_
``
Es
ist
ein
ganz
einfaches
Ding
,
''
_
and
*NL*
he
began
to
explain
the
construction
of
the
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
it
does
n't
bind
too
.
I
saw
one
at
the
Vienna
exhibition
,
*NL*
which
binds
with
a
wire
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
.
``
They
would
be
more
profitable
*NL*
in
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Es
kommt
drauf
an
...
Der
Preis
vom
Draht
muss
ausgerechnet
werden

''
_
*NL*
And
the
German
,
roused
from
his
taciturnity
,
turned
to
Vronsky
.
_
``
Das
*NL*
laesst
sich
ausrechnen
,
Erlaucht

''
_
The
German
was
just
feeling
in
the
*NL*
pocket
where
were
his
pencil
and
the
notebook
he
always
wrote
in
,
but
*NL*
recollecting
that
he
was
at
a
dinner
,
and
observing
Vronsky
's
chilly
*NL*
glance
,
he
checked
himself
.
_
``
Zu
compliziert
,
macht
zu
viel
Klopot
,
''
_
he
*NL*
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Wuenscht
man
Dochots
,
so
hat
man
auch
Klopots

''
_
said
Vassenka
*NL*
Veslovsky
,
mimicking
the
German
.
_
``
J'adore
l'allemand
,
''
_
he
addressed
*NL*
Anna
again
with
the
same
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Cessez
,
''
_
she
said
with
playful
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
expected
to
find
you
in
the
fields
,
Vassily
Semyonitch
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
the
doctor
,
a
sickly-looking
man
;
``
have
you
been
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
there
,
but
I
had
taken
flight
,
''
the
doctor
answered
with
gloomy
*NL*
jocoseness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
've
taken
a
good
constitutional
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
was
the
old
woman
?
I
hope
it
's
not
typhus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Typhus
it
is
not
,
but
it
's
taking
a
bad
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
''
said
Anna
,
and
having
thus
paid
the
dues
of
civility
to
*NL*
her
domestic
circle
,
she
turned
to
her
own
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
hard
task
,
though
,
to
construct
a
machine
from
your
*NL*
description
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
Sviazhsky
said
jestingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
why
so
?
''
said
Anna
with
a
smile
that
betrayed
that
she
knew
*NL*
there
was
something
charming
in
her
disquisitions
upon
the
machine
that
*NL*
had
been
noticed
by
Sviazhsky
.
This
new
trait
of
girlish
coquettishness
*NL*
made
an
unpleasant
impression
on
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Anna
Arkadyevna
's
knowledge
of
architecture
is
marvelous
,
''
said
*NL*
Tushkevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
heard
Anna
Arkadyevna
talking
yesterday
about
plinths
and
*NL*
damp-courses
,
''
said
Veslovsky
.
``
Have
I
got
it
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
marvelous
about
it
,
when
one
sees
and
hears
so
much
of
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
But
,
I
dare
say
,
you
do
n't
even
know
what
houses
are
*NL*
made
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
saw
that
Anna
disliked
the
tone
of
raillery
that
*NL*
existed
between
her
and
Veslovsky
,
but
fell
in
with
it
against
her
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
acted
in
this
matter
quite
differently
from
Levin
.
He
obviously
*NL*
attached
no
significance
to
Veslovsky
's
chattering
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
*NL*
encouraged
his
jests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
tell
us
,
Veslovsky
,
how
are
the
stones
held
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
cement
,
of
course

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo

And
what
is
cement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
some
sort
of
paste
...
no
,
putty

''
said
Veslovsky
,
raising
a
*NL*
general
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
at
dinner
,
with
the
exception
of
the
doctor
,
the
architect
,
*NL*
and
the
steward
,
who
remained
plunged
in
gloomy
silence
,
kept
up
a
*NL*
conversation
that
never
paused
,
glancing
off
one
subject
,
fastening
on
*NL*
another
,
and
at
times
stinging
one
or
the
other
to
the
quick
.
Once
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
felt
wounded
to
the
quick
,
and
got
so
hot
that
she
*NL*
positively
flushed
and
wondered
afterwards
whether
she
had
said
anything
*NL*
extreme
or
unpleasant
.
Sviazhsky
began
talking
of
Levin
,
describing
his
*NL*
strange
view
that
machinery
is
simply
pernicious
in
its
effects
on
*NL*
Russian
agriculture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
this
M.
Levin
,
''
Vronsky
said
,
*NL*
smiling
,
``
but
most
likely
he
has
never
seen
the
machines
he
condemns
;
or
*NL*
if
he
has
seen
and
tried
any
,
it
must
have
been
after
a
queer
fashion
,
*NL*
some
Russian
imitation
,
not
a
machine
from
abroad

What
sort
of
views
*NL*
can
anyone
have
on
such
a
subject
?

Vronsky

pouring
water
from
an
iced

decanter
into
a
delicate
glass
on
a
high
stem

``

for

keenly
affected
by

-LRB-
he
indicated
Sviazhsky
-RRB-
,
``
in
electing
me
a
justice

I
consider
that
for

the
duty

being
present
at
the
*NL*
session
,
of
judging
some
peasants

quarrel
about
a
horse

is
as
*NL*
important
as
anything
I
can
do

And
I
shall
regard
it
as
an
honor
if
*NL*
they
elect
me
for
the
district

.
It
's
only
in
that
way
I
can
pay
*NL*
for
the
advantages
I
enjoy
as
a
landowner

Unluckily
they
do

the
weight
that

big
landowners
ought
to
have
in

*NL*
It
was
strange
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
to
hear
how
serenely
confident
he
*NL*
was
of
being
right
at
his
own
table
.
She
thought
how
Levin
,
who
believed
*NL*
the
opposite
,
was
just
as
positive
in
his
opinions
at
his
own
table

But
*NL*
she
loved
Levin
,

so
she
was
on
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
can
reckon
upon
you
,
count
,
for
the
coming
elections
?
''
said
*NL*
Sviazhsky
.
``
But
you
must
come
a
little
beforehand
,
so
as
to
be
on
the
*NL*
spot
by
the
eighth

If
you
would
do
me
the
honor
to
stop
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
agree
with
your
beau-frere
,
''
said
Anna
,
``
though
not
quite
on
*NL*
the
same
ground
as
he
,
''
she
added
with
a
smile
.
``
I
'm
afraid
that
we
have
*NL*
too
many
of
these
public
duties
in
these
latter
days
.
Just
as
in
old
*NL*
days
there
were
so
many
government
functionaries
that
one
had
to
call
in
*NL*
a
functionary
for
every
single
thing
,
so
now
everyone
's
doing
some
sort
*NL*
of
public
duty
.
Alexey
has
been
here
now
six
months
,
and
he
's
a
member
,
*NL*
I
do
believe
,
of
five
or
six
different
public
bodies
.
_
Du
train
que
cela
*NL*
va
,
_
the
whole
time
will
be
wasted
on
it
.
And
I
'm
afraid
that
with
such
*NL*
a
multiplicity
of
these
bodies
,
they
'll
end
in
being
a
mere
form
.
How
*NL*
many
are
you
a
member
of
,
Nikolay
Ivanitch
?
''
she
turned
to
*NL*
Sviazhsky
--
``
over
twenty
,
I
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
spoke
lightly
,
but
irritation
could
be
discerned
in
her
tone
.
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
watching
Anna
and
Vronsky
attentively
,
detected
it
*NL*
instantly
.
She
noticed
,
too
,
that
as
she
spoke
Vronsky
's
face
had
*NL*
immediately
taken
a
serious
and
obstinate
expression
.
Noticing
this
,
and
*NL*
that
Princess
Varvara
at
once
made
haste
to
change
the
conversation
by
*NL*
talking
of
Petersburg
acquaintances
,
and
remembering
what
Vronsky
had
*NL*
without
apparent
connection
said
in
the
garden
of
his
work
in
the
*NL*
country
,
Dolly
surmised
that
this
question
of
public
activity
was
*NL*
connected
with
some
deep
private
disagreement
between
Anna
and
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
,
the
wine
,
the
decoration
of
the
table
were
all
very
good
;
*NL*
but
it
was
all
like
what
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
seen
at
formal
dinners
*NL*
and
balls
which
of
late
years
had
become
quite
unfamiliar
to
her
;
it
all
*NL*
had
the
same
impersonal
and
constrained
character
,
and
so
on
an
ordinary
*NL*
day
and
in
a
little
circle
of
friends
it
made
a
disagreeable
impression
*NL*
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
they
sat
on
the
terrace
,
then
they
proceeded
to
play
lawn
*NL*
tennis
.
The
players
,
divided
into
two
parties
,
stood
on
opposite
sides
*NL*
of
a
tightly
drawn
net
with
gilt
poles
on
the
carefully
leveled
and
*NL*
rolled
croquet-ground
.
Darya
Alexandrovna
made
an
attempt
to
play
,
but
*NL*
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
could
understand
the
game
,
and
by
the
time
*NL*
she
did
understand
it
,
she
was
so
tired
that
she
sat
down
with
Princess
*NL*
Varvara
and
simply
looked
on
at
the
players
.
Her
partner
,
Tushkevitch
,
*NL*
gave
up
playing
too
,
but
the
others
kept
the
game
up
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
Sviazhsky
and
Vronsky
both
played
very
well
and
seriously
.
They
kept
a
*NL*
sharp
lookout
on
the
balls
served
to
them
,
and
without
haste
or
getting
*NL*
in
each
other
's
way
,
they
ran
adroitly
up
to
them
,
waited
for
the
*NL*
rebound
,
and
neatly
and
accurately
returned
them
over
the
net
.
Veslovsky
*NL*
played
worse
than
the
others
.
He
was
too
eager
,
but
he
kept
the
players
*NL*
lively
with
his
high
spirits
.
His
laughter
and
outcries
never
paused
.
*NL*
Like
the
other
men
of
the
party
,
with
the
ladies
'
permission
,
he
took
*NL*
off
his
coat
,
and
his
solid
,
comely
figure
in
his
white
shirt-sleeves
,
*NL*
with
his
red
perspiring
face
and
his
impulsive
movements
,
made
a
picture
*NL*
that
imprinted
itself
vividly
on
the
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Darya
Alexandrovna
lay
in
bed
that
night
,
as
soon
as
she
closed
her
*NL*
eyes
,
she
saw
Vassenka
Veslovsky
flying
about
the
croquet
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
game
Darya
Alexandrovna
was
not
enjoying
herself
.
She
did
not
*NL*
like
the
light
tone
of
raillery
that
was
kept
up
all
the
time
between
*NL*
Vassenka
Veslovsky
and
Anna
,
and
the
unnaturalness
altogether
of
*NL*
grown-up
people
,
all
alone
without
children
,
playing
at
a
child
's
game
.
*NL*
But
to
avoid
breaking
up
the
party
and
to
get
through
the
time
somehow
,
*NL*
after
a
rest
she
joined
the
game
again
,
and
pretended
to
be
enjoying
it
.
*NL*
All
that
day
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
were
acting
in
a
theater
*NL*
with
actors
cleverer
than
she
,
and
that
her
bad
acting
was
spoiling
the
*NL*
whole
performance
.
She
had
come
with
the
intention
of
staying
two
days
,
*NL*
if
all
went
well
.
But
in
the
evening
,
during
the
game
,
she
made
up
her
*NL*
mind
that
she
would
go
home
next
day
.
The
maternal
cares
and
worries
,
*NL*
which
she
had
so
hated
on
the
way
,
now
,
after
a
day
spent
without
them
,
*NL*
struck
her
in
quite
another
light
,
and
tempted
her
back
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
after
evening
tea
and
a
row
by
night
in
the
boat
,
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
went
alone
to
her
room
,
took
off
her
dress
,
and
began
*NL*
arranging
her
thin
hair
for
the
night
,
she
had
a
great
sense
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
positively
disagreeable
to
her
to
think
that
Anna
was
coming
to
*NL*
see
her
immediately
.
She
longed
to
be
alone
with
her
own
thoughts
.

*NL*
Dolly
was
wanting
to
go
to
bed
when
Anna
came
in
to
see
her
,
attired
for
*NL*
the
night
.
In
the
course
of
the
day
Anna
had
several
times
begun
to
*NL*
speak
of
matters
near
her
heart
,
and
every
time
after
a
few
words
she
*NL*
had
stopped
:
``
Afterwards
,
by
ourselves
,
we
'll
talk
about
everything
.
*NL*
I
've
got
so
much
I
want
to
tell
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
they
were
by
themselves
,
and
Anna
did
not
know
what
to
talk
about
.
*NL*
She
sat
in
the
window
looking
at
Dolly
,
and
going
over
in
her
own
mind
*NL*
all
the
stores
of
intimate
talk
which
had
seemed
so
inexhaustible
*NL*
beforehand
,
and
she
found
nothing
.
At
that
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
everything
had
been
said
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
of
Kitty
?
''
she
said
with
a
heavy
sigh
,
looking
penitently
at
*NL*
Dolly
.
``
Tell
me
the
truth
,
Dolly
:
is
n't
she
angry
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angry
?
Oh
,
no
!
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
hates
me
,
despises
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
But
you
know
that
sort
of
thing
is
n't
forgiven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Anna
,
turning
away
and
looking
out
of
the
open
window
.
*NL*
``
But
I
was
not
to
blame
.
And
who
is
to
blame
?
What
's
the
meaning
of
*NL*
being
to
blame
?
Could
it
have
been
otherwise
?
What
do
you
think
?
Could
*NL*
it
possibly
have
happened
that
you
did
n't
become
the
wife
of
Stiva
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

I
do
n't

But
this
is
what
I
want
you
to
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

we
've
not
finished

happy

*NL*
repeated

*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

me
about
yourself

Dolly
did
not
know
what
to
call
him
.
She
felt
it
*NL*
awkward
to
call
him
either
the
count
or
Alexey
Kirillovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
Alexey

''
said
Anna
,
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``
No

we
came
here
early
in

spring

lived
quite
alone

shall
be
alone
again

I
desire
nothing
better

living
alone

alone

see

everything

often
be
repeated

will
be
half
the

away
from

she
said
,
getting
up
and
sitting
down
close
by
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

she
interrupted
Dolly
,
who
would
have
answered

about
with

*NL*

spoke

Anna
said
,
not
looking
at
Dolly
,
and
half
closing
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

And
,
in
spite
of
all
her
*NL*
emotion
,
Anna
smiled
,
as
she
caught
the
naive
expression
of
curiosity
,
*NL*
wonder
,
and
horror
on
Dolly
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
told
me
after
my
illness
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
said
Dolly
,
opening
her
eyes
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
her
this
was
one
of
those
discoveries
the
consequences
and
*NL*
deductions
from
which
are
so
immense
that
all
that
one
feels
for
the
*NL*
first
instant
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
take
it
all
in
,
and
that
one
*NL*
will
have
to
reflect
a
great
,
great
deal
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
discovery
,
suddenly
throwing
light
on
all
those
families
of
one
or
*NL*
two
children
,
which
had
hitherto
been
so
incomprehensible
to
her
,
*NL*
aroused
so
many
ideas
,
reflections
,
and
contradictory
emotions
,
that
she
*NL*
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
simply
gazed
with
wide-open
eyes
of
wonder
at
*NL*
Anna
.
This
was
the
very
thing
she
had
been
dreaming
of
,
but
now
learning
*NL*
that
it
was
possible
,
she
was
horrified
.
She
felt
that
it
was
too
simple
*NL*
a
solution
of
too
complicated
a
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
N'est

_
was
all
she
said
,
after
a
brief
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
?
Think
,
I
have
a
choice
between
two
alternatives
:
either
to
be
*NL*
with
child
,
that
is
an
invalid
,
or
to
be
the
friend
and
companion
of
my
*NL*
husband
--
practically
my
husband
,
''
Anna
said
in
a
tone
intentionally
*NL*
superficial
and
frivolous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
hearing
the
very
arguments
she
had
*NL*
used
to
herself
,
and
not
finding
the
same
force
in
them
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
,
for
other
people

''
said
Anna
,
as
though
divining
her
thoughts
,
*NL*
``
there
may
be
reason
to
hesitate
;
but
for
me

You
must
consider
,
I
am
*NL*
not
his
wife
;
he
loves
me
as
long
as
he
loves
me
.
And
how
am
I
to
keep
*NL*
his
love
?
Not
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
her
white
hands
in
a
curve
before
her
waist
with
extraordinary
*NL*
rapidity
,
as
happens
during
moments
of
excitement
;
ideas
and
memories
*NL*
rushed
into
Darya
Alexandrovna
's
head
.
``
I
,
''
she
thought
,
``
did
not
keep
*NL*
my
attraction
for
Stiva
;
he
left
me
for
others
,
and
the
first
woman
for
*NL*
whom
he
betrayed
me
did
not
keep
him
by
being
always
pretty
and
lively
.
*NL*
He
deserted
her
and
took
another
.
And
can
Anna
attract
and
keep
Count
*NL*
Vronsky
in
that
way
?
If
that
is
what
he
looks
for
,
he
will
find
dresses
*NL*
and
manners
still
more
attractive
and
charming
.
And
however
white
and
*NL*
beautiful
her
bare
arms
are
,
however
beautiful
her
full
figure
and
her
*NL*
eager
face
under
her
black
curls
,
he
will
find
something
better
still
,
*NL*
just
as
my
disgusting
,
pitiful
,
and
charming
husband
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
made
no
answer
,
she
merely
sighed
.
Anna
noticed
this
sigh
,
*NL*
indicating
dissent
,
and
she
went
on
.
In
her
armory
she
had
other
*NL*
arguments
so
strong
that
no
answer
could
be
made
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
that
it
's
not
right
?
But
you
must
consider
,
''
she
went
on
;
*NL*
``
you
forget
my
position
.
How
can
I
desire
children
?
I
'm
not
speaking
of
*NL*
the
suffering
,
I
'm
not
afraid
of
that
.
Think
only
,
what
are
my
children
*NL*
to
be
?
Ill-fated
children
,
who
will
have
to
bear
a
stranger
's
name
.
For
*NL*
the
very
fact
of
their
birth
they
will
be
forced
to
be
ashamed
of
their
*NL*
mother
,
their
father
,
their
birth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
is
just
why
a
divorce
is
necessary
.
''
But
Anna
did
not
hear
*NL*
her
.
She
longed
to
give
utterance
to
all
the
arguments
with
which
she
*NL*
had
so
many
times
convinced
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
reason
given
me
for
,
if
I
am
not

use
it
to
avoid
bringing
*NL*
unhappy
beings
into
the
world
!
''
She
looked
at
Dolly
,
but
without
waiting
*NL*
for
a
reply
she
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
always
feel
I
had
wronged
these
unhappy
children
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
If
they
are
not
,
at
any
rate
they
are
not
unhappy
;
while
if
they
are
*NL*
unhappy
,
I
alone
should
be
to
blame
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
very
arguments
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
used
in
her
own
*NL*
reflections
;
but
she
heard
them
without
understanding
them
.
``
How
can
one
*NL*
wrong
creatures
that
do
n't
exist
?
''
she
thought
.
And
all
at
once
the
idea
*NL*
struck
her
:
could
it
possibly
,
under
any
circumstances
,
have
been
better
*NL*
for
her
favorite
Grisha
if
he
had
never
existed
?
And
this
seemed
to
her
*NL*
so
wild
,
so
strange
,
that
she
shook
her
head
to
drive
away
this
tangle
*NL*
of
whirling
,
mad
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
know
;
it
's
not
right
,
''
was
all
she
said
,
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
disgust
on
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
must
n't
forget
that
you
and
I.
...
And
besides
that
,
''
added
*NL*
Anna
,
in
spite
of
the
wealth
of
her
arguments
and
the
poverty
of
Dolly
's
*NL*
objections
,
seeming
still
to
admit
that
it
was
not
right
,
``
do
n't
forget
*NL*
the
chief
point
,
that
I
am
not
now
in
the
same
position
as
you

For
you
*NL*
the
question
is
:
do
you
desire
not
to
have
any
more
children
;
while
for
*NL*
me
it
is
:
do
I
desire
to
have
them
?
And
that
's
a
great
difference
.
You
*NL*
must
see
that
I
ca
n't
desire
it
in
my
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
made
no
reply
.
She
suddenly
felt
that
she
had
got
far
*NL*
away
from
Anna
;
that
there
lay
between
them
a
barrier
of
questions
on
*NL*
which
they
could
never
agree
,
and
about
which
it
was
better
not
to
*NL*
speak
.

Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Anna
,
speaking
all
at
once
in
an
utterly
*NL*
different
tone

subdued
and
mournful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely

hastened
to

noticing
the

expression
of
suffering
on
Anna

face
.
``

anxious

suddenly
changed
the

she
repeated
,
and
a
flush
*NL*
rose
into
her
face
.
She
got
up
,
straightening
her
chest
,
and
sighed
*NL*
heavily
.
With
her
light
step
she
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
,
*NL*
stopping
now
and
then
.
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
sitting
erect
on
a
chair

turned
her
head
,
following
*NL*
Anna
with
a
face
of
sympathetic
suffering

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

said
softly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose

make
the
attempt

What
does
it
mean

she
said
,
evidently
*NL*
giving
utterance
to
a
thought
,
a
thousand
times
thought
over
and
learned
*NL*
by
heart
.
``
It
means
that
I
,
hating
him

still
recognizing
that

have
wronged

consent

Well

''
Anna
was
at
that
moment
at
the
furthest
*NL*
end
of
the
room
,
and
she
stopped
there
,
doing
something
to
the
curtain
*NL*
at
the
window
.
``
I
receive
his
consent

my

my
son

up

up

abandoned

love

equally

I
think

both
more
*NL*

two
creatures

Seryozha

Alexey

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stood
facing
Dolly
,
with
*NL*
her
arms
pressed
tightly
across
her
chest
.
In
her
white
dressing
gown
*NL*
her
figure
seemed
more
than
usually
grand
and
broad
.
She
bent
her
head
,
*NL*
and
with
shining
,
wet
eyes
looked
from
under
her
brows
at
Dolly
,
a
thin
*NL*
little
pitiful
figure
in
her
patched
dressing
jacket
and
nightcap
,
*NL*
shaking
all
over
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
those
two
creatures
that
I
love

and
one
excludes

*NL*
I

have
them
together

and
that
's
the
only
thing
I
want

And
since
*NL*
I
ca

have
that

I
do

I
do
n't

anything

it

end
one

another

so
I
ca

*NL*
I
do

like
to
talk

So
do
n't
blame
me

do

judge
me
for
*NL*
anything

You

suffering

She
went
up
,
sat
down
beside
Dolly
,
and
with
a
guilty
look
,
*NL*
peeped
into
her
face
and
took
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking

What
are
you
thinking

Do

deserve
contempt

I

simply
unhappy

If
anyone
is
unhappy

*NL*
I
am

she
articulated
,
and
turning
away
,
she
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Left
alone
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
said
her
prayers
and
went
to
bed
.
She
had
*NL*
felt
for
Anna
with
all
her
heart
while
she
was
speaking
to
her
,
but
now
*NL*
she
could
not
force
herself
to
think
of
her
.
The
memories
of
home
and
of
*NL*
her
children
rose
up
in
her
imagination
with
a
peculiar
charm
quite
new
*NL*
to
her
,
with
a
sort
of
new
brilliance
.
That
world
of
her
own
seemed
to
*NL*
her
now
so
sweet
and
precious
that
she
would
not
on
any
account
spend
an
*NL*
extra
day
outside
it
,
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
certainly
*NL*
go
back
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
meantime
went
back
to
her
boudoir
,
took
a
wine
glass
and
dropped
*NL*
into
it
several
drops
of
a
medicine
,
of
which
the
principal
ingredient
*NL*
was
morphine
.
After
drinking
it
off
and
sitting
still
a
little
while
,
*NL*
she
went
into
her
bedroom
in
a
soothed
and
more
cheerful
frame
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
into
the
bedroom
,
Vronsky
looked
intently
at
her
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
for
traces
of
the
conversation
which
he
knew
that
,
staying
so
*NL*
long
in
Dolly
's
room
,
she
must
have
had
with
her
.
But
in
her
expression
*NL*
of
restrained
excitement
,
and
of
a
sort
of
reserve
,
he
could
find
*NL*
nothing
but
the
beauty
that
always
bewitched
him
afresh
though
he
was
*NL*
used
to
it
,
the
consciousness
of
it
,
and
the
desire
that
it
should
*NL*
affect
him
.
He
did
not
want
to
ask
her
what
they
had
been
talking
of
,
*NL*
but
he
hoped
that
she
would
tell
him
something
of
her
own
accord
.
But
*NL*
she
only
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
you
like
Dolly
.
You
do
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
known
her
a
long
while
,
you
know
.
She
's
very
good-hearted
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
_
mais
excessivement
terre-a-terre
.
_
Still
,
I
'm
very
glad
to
see
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
Anna
's
hand
and
looked
inquiringly
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Misinterpreting
the
look
,
she
smiled
to
him
.
Next
morning
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
protests
of
her
hosts
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
prepared
for
her
homeward
*NL*
journey
.
Levin
's
coachman
,
in
his
by
no
means
new
coat
and
shabby
hat
,
*NL*
with
his
ill-matched
horses
and
his
coach
with
the
patched
mud-guards
,
*NL*
drove
with
gloomy
determination
into
the
covered
gravel
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Darya
Alexandrovna
disliked
taking
leave
of
Princess
Varvara
and
the
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
party
.
After
a
day
spent
together
,
both
she
and
her
*NL*
hosts
were
distinctly
aware
that
they
did
not
get
on
together
,
and
that
*NL*
it
was
better
for
them
not
to
meet
.
Only
Anna
was
sad
.
She
knew
that
*NL*
now
,
from
Dolly
's
departure
,
no
one
again
would
stir
up
within
her
soul
*NL*
the
feelings
that
had
been
roused
by
their
conversation
.
It
hurt
her
to
*NL*
stir
up
these
feelings
,
but
yet
she
knew
that
that
was
the
best
part
of
*NL*
her
soul
,
and
that
that
part
of
her
soul
would
quickly
be
smothered
in
*NL*
the
life
she
was
leading
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
drove
out
into
the
open
country
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
had
a
*NL*
delightful
sense
of
relief
,
and
she
felt
tempted
to
ask
the
two
men
how
*NL*
they
had
liked
being
at
Vronsky
's
,
when
suddenly
the
coachman
,
Philip
,
*NL*
expressed
himself
unasked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rolling
in
wealth
they
may
be
,
but
three
pots
of
oats
was
all
they
gave
*NL*
us
.
Everything
cleared
up
till
there
was
n't
a
grain
left
by
cockcrow
.
*NL*
What
are
three
pots
?
A
mere
mouthful
!
And
oats
now
down
to
forty-five
*NL*
kopecks
.
At
our
place
,
no
fear
,
all
comers
may
have
as
much
as
they
can
*NL*
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
master
's
a
screw
,
''
put
in
the
counting
house
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
like
their
horses
?
''
asked
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horses
!
--
there
's
no
two
opinions
about
them
.
And
the
food
was
good
.
*NL*
But
it
seemed
to
me
sort
of
dreary
there
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
you
thought
,
''
he
said
,
turning
his
handsome
,
good-natured
face
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
too
.
Well
,
shall
we
get
home
by
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
we
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
and
finding
everyone
entirely
satisfactory
and
*NL*
particularly
charming
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
began
with
great
liveliness
*NL*
telling
them
how
she
had
arrived
,
how
warmly
they
had
received
her
,
of
*NL*
the
luxury
and
good
taste
in
which
the
Vronskys
lived
,
and
of
their
*NL*
recreations
,
and
she
would
not
allow
a
word
to
be
said
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
has
to
know
Anna
and
Vronsky
--
I
have
got
to
know
him
better
now
--
to
*NL*
see
how
nice
they
are
,
and
how
touching
,
''
she
said
,
speaking
now
with
*NL*
perfect
sincerity
,
and
forgetting
the
vague
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
*NL*
and
awkwardness
she
had
experienced
there
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
and
Anna
spent
the
whole
summer
and
part
of
the
winter
in
the
*NL*
country
,
living
in
just
the
same
condition
,
and
still
taking
no
steps
to
*NL*
obtain
a
divorce
.
It
was
an
understood
thing
between
them
that
they
*NL*
should
not
go
away
anywhere
;
but
both
felt
,
the
longer
they
lived
alone
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
autumn
,
without
guests
in
the
house
,
that
they
could
*NL*
not
stand
this
existence
,
and
that
they
would
have
to
alter
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
life
was
apparently
such
that
nothing
better
could
be
desired
.
*NL*
They
had
the
fullest
abundance
of
everything
;
they
had
a
child
,
and
both
*NL*
had
occupation
.
Anna
devoted
just
as
much
care
to
her
appearance
when
*NL*
they
had
no
visitors
,
and
she
did
a
great
deal
of
reading
,
both
of
*NL*
novels
and
of
what
serious
literature
was
in
fashion
.
She
ordered
all
*NL*
the
books
that
were
praised
in
the
foreign
papers
and
reviews
she
*NL*
received
,
and
read
them
with
that
concentrated
attention
which
is
only
*NL*
given
to
what
is
read
in
seclusion
.
Moreover
,
every
subject
that
was
of
*NL*
interest
to
Vronsky
,
she
studied
in
books
and
special
journals
,
so
that
*NL*
he
often
went
straight
to
her
with
questions
relating
to
agriculture
or
*NL*
architecture
,
sometimes
even
with
questions
relating
to
horse-breeding
*NL*
or
sport
.
He
was
amazed
at
her
knowledge
,
her
memory
,
and
at
first
was
*NL*
disposed
to
doubt
it
,
to
ask
for
confirmation
of
her
facts
;
and
she
*NL*
would
find
what
he
asked
for
in
some
book
,
and
show
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
of
the
hospital
,
too
,
interested
her
.
She
did
not
merely
*NL*
assist
,
but
planned
and
suggested
a
great
deal
herself
.
But
her
chief
*NL*
thought
was
still
of
herself
--
how
far
she
was
dear
to
Vronsky
,
how
far
*NL*
she
could
make
up
to
him
for
all
he
had
given
up
.
Vronsky
appreciated
*NL*
this
desire
not
only
to
please
,
but
to
serve
him
,
which
had
become
the
*NL*
sole
aim
of
her
existence
,
but
at
the
same
time
he
wearied
of
the
loving
*NL*
snares
in
which
she
tried
to
hold
him
fast
.
As
time
went
on
,
and
he
saw
*NL*
himself
more
and
more
often
held
fast
in
these
snares
,
he
had
an
ever
*NL*
growing
desire
,
not
so
much
to
escape
from
them
,
as
to
try
whether
they
*NL*
hindered
his
freedom
.
Had
it
not
been
for
this
growing
desire
to
be
*NL*
free
,
not
to
have
scenes
every
time
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
town
to
a
*NL*
meeting
or
a
race
,
Vronsky
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
*NL*
life
.
The
role
he
had
taken
up
,
the
role
of
a
wealthy
landowner
,
one
of
*NL*
that
class
which
ought
to
be
the
very
heart
of
the
Russian
aristocracy
,
*NL*
was
entirely
to
his
taste
;
and
now
,
after
spending
six
months
in
that
*NL*
character
,
he
derived
even
greater
satisfaction
from
it
.
And
his
*NL*
management
of
his
estate
,
which
occupied
and
absorbed
him
more
and
more
,
*NL*
was
most
successful
.
In
spite
of
the
immense
sums
cost
him
by
the
*NL*
hospital
,
by
machinery
,
by
cows
ordered
from
Switzerland
,
and
many
other
*NL*
things
,
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
not
wasting
,
but
increasing
his
*NL*
substance
.
In
all
matters
affecting
income
,
the
sales
of
timber
,
wheat
,
*NL*
and
wool
,
the
letting
of
lands
,
Vronsky
was
hard
as
a
rock
,
and
knew
*NL*
well
how
to
keep
up
prices
.
In
all
operations
on
a
large
scale
on
this
*NL*
and
his
other
estates
,
he
kept
to
the
simplest
methods
involving
no
*NL*
risk
,
and
in
trifling
details
he
was
careful
and
exacting
to
an
extreme
*NL*
degree
.
In
spite
of
all
the
cunning
and
ingenuity
of
the
German
steward
,
*NL*
who
would
try
to
tempt
him
into
purchases
by
making
his
original
*NL*
estimate
always
far
larger
than
really
required
,
and
then
representing
*NL*
to
Vronsky
that
he
might
get
the
thing
cheaper
,
and
so
make
a
profit
,
*NL*
Vronsky
did
not
give
in
.
He
listened
to
his
steward
,
cross-examined
him
,
*NL*
and
only
agreed
to
his
suggestions
when
the
implement
to
be
ordered
or
*NL*
constructed
was
the
very
newest
,
not
yet
known
in
Russia
,
and
likely
to
*NL*
excite
wonder
.
Apart
from
such
exceptions
,
he
resolved
upon
an
increased
*NL*
outlay
only
where
there
was
a
surplus
,
and
in
making
such
an
outlay
he
*NL*
went
into
the
minutest
details
,
and
insisted
on
getting
the
very
best
*NL*
for
his
money
;
so
that
by
the
method
on
which
he
managed
his
affairs
,
it
*NL*
was
clear
that
he
was
not
wasting
,
but
increasing
his
substance
.

In
October
there
were
the
provincial
elections
in
the
Kashinsky
*NL*
province
,
where
were
the
estates
of
Vronsky
,
Sviazhsky
,
Koznishev
,
*NL*
Oblonsky
,
and
a
small
part
of
Levin
's
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
elections
were
attracting
public
attention
from
several
*NL*
circumstances
connected
with
them
,
and
also
from
the
people
taking
part
*NL*
in
them
.
There
had
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
them
,
and
great
*NL*
preparations
were
being
made
for
them
.
Persons
who
never
attended
the
*NL*
elections
were
coming
from
Moscow
,
from
Petersburg
,
and
from
abroad
to
*NL*
attend
these
.
Vronsky
had
long
before
promised
Sviazhsky
to
go
to
them
.
*NL*
Before
the
elections
Sviazhsky
,
who
often
visited
Vozdvizhenskoe
,
drove
*NL*
over
to
fetch
Vronsky
.
On
the
day
before
there
had
been
almost
a
quarrel
*NL*
between
Vronsky
and
Anna
over
this
proposed
expedition
.
It
was
the
very
*NL*
dullest
autumn
weather
,
which
is
so
dreary
in
the
country
,
and
so
,
*NL*
preparing
himself
for
a
struggle
,
Vronsky
,
with
a
hard
and
cold
*NL*
expression
,
informed
Anna
of
his
departure
as
he
had
never
spoken
to
her
*NL*
before
.
But
,
to
his
surprise
,
Anna
accepted
the
information
with
great
*NL*
composure
,
and
merely
asked
when
he
would
be
back
.
He
looked
intently
at
*NL*
her
,
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
composure
.
She
smiled
at
his
look
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
way
she
had
of
withdrawing
into
herself
,
and
knew
that
it
only
*NL*
happened
when
she
had
determined
upon
something
without
letting
him
know
*NL*
her
plans
.
He
was
afraid
of
this
;
but
he
was
so
anxious
to
avoid
a
scene
*NL*
that
he
kept
up
appearances
,
and
half
sincerely
believed
in
what
he
*NL*
longed
to
believe
in
--
her
reasonableness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
wo
n't
be
dull
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
said
Anna
.
``
I
got
a
box
of
books
yesterday
from
Gautier
's
.
*NL*
No
,
I
sha
n't
be
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
trying
to
take
that
tone
,
and
so
much
the
better
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
``
or
else
it
would
be
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
set
off
for
the
elections
without
appealing
to
her
for
a
candid
*NL*
explanation
.
It
was
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
their
intimacy
*NL*
that
he
had
parted
from
her
without
a
full
explanation
.
From
one
point
*NL*
of
view
this
troubled
him
,
but
on
the
other
side
he
felt
that
it
was
*NL*
better
so
.
``
At
first
there
will
be
,
as
this
time
,
something
undefined
*NL*
kept
back
,
and
then
she
will
get
used
to
it
.
In
any
case
I
can
give
up
*NL*
anything
for
her
,
but
not
my
masculine
independence
,
''
he
thought
.

In
September
Levin
moved
to
Moscow
for
Kitty
's
confinement
.
He
had
spent
*NL*
a
whole
month
in
Moscow
with
nothing
to
do
,
when
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
*NL*
had
property
in
the
Kashinsky
province
,
and
took
great
interest
in
the
*NL*
question
of
the
approaching
elections
,
made
ready
to
set
off
to
the
*NL*
elections
.
He
invited
his
brother
,
who
had
a
vote
in
the
Seleznevsky
*NL*
district
,
to
come
with
him
.
Levin
had
,
moreover
,
to
transact
in
Kashin
*NL*
some
extremely
important
business
relating
to
the
wardship
of
land
and
*NL*
to
the
receiving
of
certain
redemption
money
for
his
sister
,
who
was
*NL*
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
still
hesitated
,
but
Kitty
,
who
saw
that
he
was
bored
in
Moscow
,
*NL*
and
urged
him
to
go
,
on
her
own
authority
ordered
him
the
proper
*NL*
nobleman
's
uniform
,
costing
seven
pounds
.
And
that
seven
pounds
paid
for
*NL*
the
uniform
was
the
chief
cause
that
finally
decided
Levin
to
go
.
He
*NL*
went
to
Kashin
...
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
been
six
days
in
Kashin
,
visiting
the
assembly
each
day
,
and
*NL*
busily
engaged
about
his
sister
's
business
,
which
still
dragged
on
.
The
*NL*
district
marshals
of
nobility
were
all
occupied
with
the
elections
,
and
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
get
the
simplest
thing
done
that
depended
upon
the
*NL*
court
of
wardship
.
The
other
matter
,
the
payment
of
the
sums
due
,
was
*NL*
met
too
by
difficulties
.
After
long
negotiations
over
the
legal
details
,
*NL*
the
money
was
at
last
ready
to
be
paid
;
but
the
notary
,
a
most
obliging
*NL*
person
,
could
not
hand
over
the
order
,
because
it
must
have
the
*NL*
signature
of
the
president
,
and
the
president
,
though
he
had
not
given
*NL*
over
his
duties
to
a
deputy
,
was
at
the
elections
.
All
these
worrying
*NL*
negotiations
,
this
endless
going
from
place
to
place
,
and
talking
with
*NL*
pleasant
and
excellent
people
,
who
quite
saw
the
unpleasantness
of
the
*NL*
petitioner
's
position
,
but
were
powerless
to
assist
him
--
all
these
*NL*
efforts
that
yielded
no
result
,
led
to
a
feeling
of
misery
in
Levin
akin
*NL*
to
the
mortifying
helplessness
one
experiences
in
dreams
when
one
tries
*NL*
to
use
physical
force
.
He
felt
this
frequently
as
he
talked
to
his
most
*NL*
good-natured
solicitor
.
This
solicitor
did
,
it
seemed
,
everything
*NL*
possible
,
and
strained
every
nerve
to
get
him
out
of
his
difficulties
.
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
what
you
might
try
,
''
he
said
more
than
once
;
``
go
to
*NL*
so-and-so
and
so-and-so
,
''
and
the
solicitor
drew
up
a
regular
plan
for
*NL*
getting
round
the
fatal
point
that
hindered
everything
.
But
he
would
add
*NL*
immediately
,
``
It
'll
mean
some
delay
,
anyway
,
but
you
might
try
it
.
''
And
*NL*
Levin
did
try
,
and
did
go
.
Everyone
was
kind
and
civil
,
but
the
point
*NL*
evaded
seemed
to
crop
up
again
in
the
end
,
and
again
to
bar
the
way
.
*NL*
What
was
particularly
trying
,
was
that
Levin
could
not
make
out
with
*NL*
whom
he
was
struggling
,
to
whose
interest
it
was
that
his
business
*NL*
should
not
be
done
.
That
no
one
seemed
to
know
;
the
solicitor
certainly
*NL*
did
not
know
.
If
Levin
could
have
understood
why
,
just
as
he
saw
why
one
*NL*
can
only
approach
the
booking
office
of
a
railway
station
in
single
*NL*
file
,
it
would
not
have
been
so
vexatious
and
tiresome
to
him
.
But
with
*NL*
the
hindrances
that
confronted
him
in
his
business
,
no
one
could
explain
*NL*
why
they
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
had
changed
a
good
deal
since
his
marriage
;
he
was
patient
,
*NL*
and
if
he
could
not
see
why
it
was
all
arranged
like
this
,
he
told
*NL*
himself
that
he
could
not
judge
without
knowing
all
about
it
,
and
that
*NL*
most
likely
it
must
be
so
,
and
he
tried
not
to
fret
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
attending
the
elections
,
too
,
and
taking
part
in
them
,
he
tried
now
*NL*
not
to
judge
,
not
to
fall
foul
of
them
,
but
to
comprehend
as
fully
as
he
*NL*
could
the
question
which
was
so
earnestly
and
ardently
absorbing
honest
*NL*
and
excellent
men
whom
he
respected
.
Since
his
marriage
there
had
been
*NL*
revealed
to
Levin
so
many
new
and
serious
aspects
of
life
that
had
*NL*
previously
,
through
his
frivolous
attitude
to
them
,
seemed
of
no
*NL*
importance
,
that
in
the
question
of
the
elections
too
he
assumed
and
*NL*
tried
to
find
some
serious
significance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
explained
to
him
the
meaning
and
object
of
the
*NL*
proposed
revolution
at
the
elections
.
The
marshal
of
the
province
in
*NL*
whose
hands
the
law
had
placed
the
control
of
so
many
important
public
*NL*
functions
--
the
guardianship
of
wards
-LRB-
the
very
department
which
was
*NL*
giving
Levin
so
much
trouble
just
now
-RRB-
,
the
disposal
of
large
sums
*NL*
subscribed
by
the
nobility
of
the
province
,
the
high
schools
,
female
,
*NL*
male
,
and
military
,
and
popular
instruction
on
the
new
model
,
and
*NL*
finally
,
the
district
council
--
the
marshal
of
the
province
,
Snetkov
,
was
*NL*
a
nobleman
of
the
old
school
,
--
dissipating
an
immense
fortune
,
a
*NL*
good-hearted
man
,
honest
after
his
own
fashion
,
but
utterly
without
any
*NL*
comprehension
of
the
needs
of
modern
days
.
He
always
took
,
in
every
*NL*
question
,
the
side
of
the
nobility
;
he
was
positively
antagonistic
to
*NL*
the
spread
of
popular
education
,
and
he
succeeded
in
giving
a
purely
*NL*
party
character
to
the
district
council
which
ought
by
rights
to
be
of
*NL*
such
an
immense
importance
.
What
was
needed
was
to
put
in
his
place
a
*NL*
fresh
,
capable
,
perfectly
modern
man
,
of
contemporary
ideas
,
and
to
*NL*
frame
their
policy
so
as
from
the
rights
conferred
upon
the
nobles
,
not
*NL*
as
the
nobility
,
but
as
an
element
of
the
district
council
,
to
extract
*NL*
all
the
powers
of
self-government
that
could
possibly
be
derived
from
*NL*
them
.
In
the
wealthy
Kashinsky
province
,
which
always
took
the
lead
of
*NL*
other
provinces
in
everything
,
there
was
now
such
a
preponderance
of
*NL*
forces
that
this
policy
,
once
carried
through
properly
there
,
might
*NL*
serve
as
a
model
for
other
provinces
for
all
Russia
.
And
hence
the
whole
*NL*
question
was
of
the
greatest
importance
.
It
was
proposed
to
elect
as
*NL*
marshal
in
place
of
Snetkov
either
Sviazhsky
,
or
,
better
still
,
*NL*
Nevyedovsky
,
a
former
university
professor
,
a
man
of
remarkable
*NL*
intelligence
and
a
great
friend
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
was
opened
by
the
governor
,
who
made
a
speech
to
the
nobles
,
*NL*
urging
them
to
elect
the
public
functionaries
,
not
from
regard
for
*NL*
persons
,
but
for
the
service
and
welfare
of
their
fatherland
,
and
hoping
*NL*
that
the
honorable
nobility
of
the
Kashinsky
province
would
,
as
at
all
*NL*
former
elections
,
hold
their
duty
as
sacred
,
and
vindicate
the
exalted
*NL*
confidence
of
the
monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
with
his
speech
,
the
governor
walked
out
of
the
*NL*
hall
,
and
the
noblemen
noisily
and
eagerly
--
some
even
*NL*
enthusiastically
--
followed
him
and
thronged
round
him
while
he
put
on
*NL*
his
fur
coat
and
conversed
amicably
with
the
marshal
of
the
province
.
*NL*
Levin
,
anxious
to
see
into
everything
and
not
to
miss
anything
,
stood
*NL*
there
too
in
the
crowd
,
and
heard
the
governor
say
:
``
Please
tell
Marya
*NL*
Ivanovna
my
wife
is
very
sorry
she
could
n't
come
to
the
Home
.
''
And
*NL*
thereupon
the
nobles
in
high
good-humor
sorted
out
their
fur
coats
and
*NL*
all
drove
off
to
the
cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
cathedral
Levin
,
lifting
his
hand
like
the
rest
and
repeating
the
*NL*
words
of
the
archdeacon
,
swore
with
most
terrible
oaths
to
do
all
the
*NL*
governor
had
hoped
they
would
do
.
Church
services
always
affected
Levin
,
*NL*
and
as
he
uttered
the
words
``
I
kiss
the
cross
,
''
and
glanced
round
at
the
*NL*
crowd
of
young
and
old
men
repeating
the
same
,
he
felt
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
and
third
days
there
was
business
relating
to
the
finances
*NL*
of
the
nobility
and
the
female
high
school
,
of
no
importance
whatever
,
*NL*
as
Sergey
Ivanovitch
explained
,
and
Levin
,
busy
seeing
after
his
own
*NL*
affairs
,
did
not
attend
the
meetings
.
On
the
fourth
day
the
auditing
of
*NL*
the
marshal
's
accounts
took
place
at
the
high
table
of
the
marshal
of
*NL*
the
province
.
And
then
there
occurred
the
first
skirmish
between
the
new
*NL*
party
and
the
old
.
The
committee
who
had
been
deputed
to
verify
the
*NL*
accounts
reported
to
the
meeting
that
all
was
in
order
.
The
marshal
of
*NL*
the
province
got
up
,
thanked
the
nobility
for
their
confidence
,
and
shed
*NL*
tears
.
The
nobles
gave
him
a
loud
welcome
,
and
shook
hands
with
him
.
But
*NL*
at
that
instant
a
nobleman
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
party
said
that
he
had
*NL*
heard
that
the
committee
had
not
verified
the
accounts
,
considering
such
*NL*
a
verification
an
insult
to
the
marshal
of
the
province
.
One
of
the
*NL*
members
of
the
committee
incautiously
admitted
this
.
Then
a
small
*NL*
gentleman
,
very
young-looking
but
very
malignant
,
began
to
say
that
it
*NL*
would
probably
be
agreeable
to
the
marshal
of
the
province
to
give
an
*NL*
account
of
his
expenditures
of
the
public
moneys
,
and
that
the
misplaced
*NL*
delicacy
of
the
members
of
the
committee
was
depriving
him
of
this
moral
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Then
the
members
of
the
committee
tried
to
withdraw
their
*NL*
admission
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
began
to
prove
that
they
must
logically
*NL*
admit
either
that
they
had
verified
the
accounts
or
that
they
had
not
,
*NL*
and
he
developed
this
dilemma
in
detail
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
answered
*NL*
by
the
spokesman
of
the
opposite
party
.
Then
Sviazhsky
spoke
,
and
then
*NL*
the
malignant
gentleman
again
.
The
discussion
lasted
a
long
time
and
*NL*
ended
in
nothing
.
Levin
was
surprised
that
they
should
dispute
upon
this
*NL*
subject
so
long
,
especially
as
,
when
he
asked
Sergey
Ivanovitch
whether
*NL*
he
supposed
that
money
had
been
misappropriated
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
He
's
an
honest
man
.
But
those
old-fashioned
methods
of
paternal
*NL*
family
arrangements
in
the
management
of
provincial
affairs
must
be
*NL*
broken
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fifth
day
came
the
elections
of
the
district
marshals
.
It
was
*NL*
rather
a
stormy
day
in
several
districts
.
In
the
Seleznevsky
district
*NL*
Sviazhsky
was
elected
unanimously
without
a
ballot
,
and
he
gave
a
dinner
*NL*
that
evening
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixth
day
was
fixed
for
the
election
of
the
marshal
of
the
province
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rooms
,
large
and
small
,
were
full
of
noblemen
in
all
sorts
of
*NL*
uniforms
.
Many
had
come
only
for
that
day
.
Men
who
had
not
seen
each
*NL*
other
for
years
,
some
from
the
Crimea
,
some
from
Petersburg
,
some
from
*NL*
abroad
,
met
in
the
rooms
of
the
Hall
of
Nobility
.
There
was
much
*NL*
discussion
around
the
governor
's
table
under
the
portrait
of
the
Tsar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nobles
,
both
in
the
larger
and
the
smaller
rooms
,
grouped
themselves
*NL*
in
camps
,
and
from
their
hostile
and
suspicious
glances
,
from
the
*NL*
silence
that
fell
upon
them
when
outsiders
approached
a
group
,
and
from
*NL*
the
way
that
some
,
whispering
together
,
retreated
to
the
farther
*NL*
corridor
,
it
was
evident
that
each
side
had
secrets
from
the
other
.
In
*NL*
appearance
the
noblemen
were
sharply
divided
into
two
classes
:
the
old
*NL*
and
the
new
.
The
old
were
for
the
most
part
either
in
old
uniforms
of
*NL*
the
nobility
,
buttoned
up
closely
,
with
spurs
and
hats
,
or
in
their
own
*NL*
special
naval
,
cavalry
,
infantry
,
or
official
uniforms
.
The
uniforms
of
*NL*
the
older
men
were
embroidered
in
the
old-fashioned
way
with
epaulets
on
*NL*
their
shoulders
;
they
were
unmistakably
tight
and
short
in
the
waist
,
as
*NL*
though
their
wearers
had
grown
out
of
them
.
The
younger
men
wore
the
*NL*
uniform
of
the
nobility
with
long
waists
and
broad
shoulders
,
unbuttoned
*NL*
over
white
waistcoats
,
or
uniforms
with
black
collars
and
with
the
*NL*
embroidered
badges
of
justices
of
the
peace
.
To
the
younger
men
belonged
*NL*
the
court
uniforms
that
here
and
there
brightened
up
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
division
into
young
and
old
did
not
correspond
with
the
division
*NL*
of
parties
.
Some
of
the
young
men
,
as
Levin
observed
,
belonged
to
the
*NL*
old
party
;
and
some
of
the
very
oldest
noblemen
,
on
the
contrary
,
were
*NL*
whispering
with
Sviazhsky
,
and
were
evidently
ardent
partisans
of
the
*NL*
new
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
stood
in
the
smaller
room
,
where
they
were
smoking
and
taking
*NL*
light
refreshments
,
close
to
his
own
friends
,
and
listening
to
what
they
*NL*
were
saying
,
he
conscientiously
exerted
all
his
intelligence
trying
to
*NL*
understand
what
was
said
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
the
center
round
which
*NL*
the
others
grouped
themselves
.
He
was
listening
at
that
moment
to
*NL*
Sviazhsky
and
Hliustov
,
the
marshal
of
another
district
,
who
belonged
to
*NL*
their
party
.
Hliustov
would
not
agree
to
go
with
his
district
to
ask
*NL*
Snetkov
to
stand
,
while
Sviazhsky
was
persuading
him
to
do
so
,
and
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
approving
of
the
plan
.
Levin
could
not
make
out
*NL*
why
the
opposition
was
to
ask
the
marshal
to
stand
whom
they
wanted
to
*NL*
supersede
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
had
just
been
drinking
and
taking
some
lunch
,
*NL*
came
up
to
them
in
his
uniform
of
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
,
wiping
*NL*
his
lips
with
a
perfumed
handkerchief
of
bordered
batiste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
placing
our
forces
,
''
he
said
,
pulling
out
his
whiskers
,
``
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
listening
to
the
conversation
,
he
supported
Sviazhsky
's
contention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
district
's
enough
,
and
Sviazhsky
's
obviously
of
the
opposition
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
words
evidently
intelligible
to
all
except
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Kostya
,
you
here
too
!
I
suppose
you
're
converted
,
eh
?
''
he
added
,
*NL*
turning
to
Levin
and
drawing
his
arm
through
his
.
Levin
would
have
been
*NL*
glad
indeed
to
be
converted
,
but
could
not
make
out
what
the
point
was
,
*NL*
and
retreating
a
few
steps
from
the
speakers
,
he
explained
to
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
his
inability
to
understand
why
the
marshal
of
the
province
*NL*
should
be
asked
to
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
O
sancta
simplicitas
!
''
_
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
briefly
and
*NL*
clearly
he
explained
it
to
Levin
.
If
,
as
at
previous
elections
,
all
the
*NL*
districts
asked
the
marshal
of
the
province
to
stand
,
then
he
would
be
*NL*
elected
without
a
ballot
.
That
must
not
be
.
Now
eight
districts
had
*NL*
agreed
to
call
upon
him
:
if
two
refused
to
do
so
,
Snetkov
might
decline
*NL*
to
stand
at
all
;
and
then
the
old
party
might
choose
another
of
their
*NL*
party
,
which
would
throw
them
completely
out
in
their
reckoning
.
But
if
*NL*
only
one
district
,
Sviazhsky
's
,
did
not
call
upon
him
to
stand
,
Snetkov
*NL*
would
let
himself
be
balloted
for
.
They
were
even
,
some
of
them
,
going
*NL*
to
vote
for
him
,
and
purposely
to
let
him
get
a
good
many
votes
,
so
that
*NL*
the
enemy
might
be
thrown
off
the
scent
,
and
when
a
candidate
of
the
*NL*
other
side
was
put
up
,
they
too
might
give
him
some
votes
.
Levin
*NL*
understood
to
some
extent
,
but
not
fully
,
and
would
have
put
a
few
more
*NL*
questions
,
when
suddenly
everyone
began
talking
and
making
a
noise
and
*NL*
they
moved
towards
the
big
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
eh
?
whom
?
''
``
No
guarantee
?
whose
?
what
?
''
``
They
wo
n't
pass
*NL*
him
?
''
``
No
guarantee
?
''
``
They
wo
n't
let
Flerov
in
?
''
``
Eh
,
because
of
the
*NL*
charge
against
him
?
''
``
Why
,
at
this
rate
,
they
wo
n't
admit
anyone
.
It
's
a
*NL*
swindle
!
''
``
The
law
!
''
Levin
heard
exclamations
on
all
sides
,
and
he
moved
*NL*
into
the
big
room
together
with
the
others
,
all
hurrying
somewhere
and
*NL*
afraid
of
missing
something
.
Squeezed
by
the
crowding
noblemen
,
he
drew
*NL*
near
the
high
table
where
the
marshal
of
the
province
,
Sviazhsky
,
and
*NL*
the
other
leaders
were
hotly
disputing
about
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
standing
rather
far
off
.
A
nobleman
breathing
heavily
and
*NL*
hoarsely
at
his
side
,
and
another
whose
thick
boots
were
creaking
,
*NL*
prevented
him
from
hearing
distinctly
.
He
could
only
hear
the
soft
voice
*NL*
of
the
marshal
faintly
,
then
the
shrill
voice
of
the
malignant
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
then
the
voice
of
Sviazhsky
.
They
were
disputing
,
as
far
*NL*
as
he
could
make
out
,
as
to
the
interpretation
to
be
put
on
the
act
and
*NL*
the
exact
meaning
of
the
words
:
``
liable
to
be
called
up
for
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
parted
to
make
way
for
Sergey
Ivanovitch
approaching
the
*NL*
table
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
waiting
till
the
malignant
gentleman
had
*NL*
finished
speaking
,
said
that
he
thought
the
best
solution
would
be
to
*NL*
refer
to
the
act
itself
,
and
asked
the
secretary
to
find
the
act
.
The
*NL*
act
said
that
in
case
of
difference
of
opinion
,
there
must
be
a
ballot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
read
the
act
and
began
to
explain
its
meaning
,
but
at
*NL*
that
point
a
tall
,
stout
,
round-shouldered
landowner
,
with
dyed
*NL*
whiskers
,
in
a
tight
uniform
that
cut
the
back
of
his
neck
,
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
He
went
up
to
the
table
,
and
striking
it
with
his
finger
ring
,
he
*NL*
shouted
loudly
:
``
A
ballot
!
Put
it
to
the
vote
!
No
need
for
more
*NL*
talking
!
''
Then
several
voices
began
to
talk
all
at
once
,
and
the
tall
*NL*
nobleman
with
the
ring
,
getting
more
and
more
exasperated
,
shouted
more
*NL*
and
more
loudly
.
But
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shouting
for
the
very
course
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
proposed
;
but
*NL*
it
was
evident
that
he
hated
him
and
all
his
party
,
and
this
feeling
of
*NL*
hatred
spread
through
the
whole
party
and
roused
in
opposition
to
it
the
*NL*
same
vindictiveness
,
though
in
a
more
seemly
form
,
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
Shouts
were
raised
,
and
for
a
moment
all
was
confusion
,
so
that
the
*NL*
marshal
of
the
province
had
to
call
for
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ballot
!
A
ballot
!
Every
nobleman
sees
it
!
We
shed
our
blood
for
our
*NL*
country
!
...
The
confidence
of
the
monarch
...
No
checking
the
accounts
*NL*
of
the
marshal
;
he
's
not
a
cashier
...
But
that
's
not
the
point
...
*NL*
Votes
,
please
!
Beastly
!
...
''
shouted
furious
and
violent
voices
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
Looks
and
faces
were
even
more
violent
and
furious
than
their
*NL*
words
.
They
expressed
the
most
implacable
hatred
.
Levin
did
not
in
the
*NL*
least
understand
what
was
the
matter
,
and
he
marveled
at
the
passion
*NL*
with
which
it
was
disputed
whether
or
not
the
decision
about
Flerov
*NL*
should
be
put
to
the
vote
.
He
forgot
,
as
Sergey
Ivanovitch
explained
to
*NL*
him
afterwards
,
this
syllogism
:
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
public
*NL*
good
to
get
rid
of
the
marshal
of
the
province
;
that
to
get
rid
of
the
*NL*
marshal
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
majority
of
votes
;
that
to
get
a
*NL*
majority
of
votes
it
was
necessary
to
secure
Flerov
's
right
to
vote
;
*NL*
that
to
secure
the
recognition
of
Flerov
's
right
to
vote
they
must
*NL*
decide
on
the
interpretation
to
be
put
on
the
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
vote
may
decide
the
whole
question
,
and
one
must
be
serious
and
*NL*
consecutive
,
if
one
wants
to
be
of
use
in
public
life
,
''
concluded
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
.
But
Levin
forgot
all
that
,
and
it
was
painful
to
him
to
see
*NL*
all
these
excellent
persons
,
for
whom
he
had
a
respect
,
in
such
an
*NL*
unpleasant
and
vicious
state
of
excitement
.
To
escape
from
this
painful
*NL*
feeling
he
went
away
into
the
other
room
where
there
was
nobody
except
*NL*
the
waiters
at
the
refreshment
bar
.
Seeing
the
waiters
busy
over
washing
*NL*
up
the
crockery
and
setting
in
order
their
plates
and
wine
glasses
,
*NL*
seeing
their
calm
and
cheerful
faces
,
Levin
felt
an
unexpected
sense
of
*NL*
relief
as
though
he
had
come
out
of
a
stuffy
room
into
the
fresh
air
.
He
*NL*
began
walking
up
and
down
,
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
waiters
.
He
*NL*
particularly
liked
the
way
one
gray-whiskered
waiter
,
who
showed
his
*NL*
scorn
for
the
other
younger
ones
and
was
jeered
at
by
them
,
was
teaching
*NL*
them
how
to
fold
up
napkins
properly
.
Levin
was
just
about
to
enter
into
*NL*
conversation
with
the
old
waiter
,
when
the
secretary
of
the
court
of
*NL*
wardship
,
a
little
old
man
whose
specialty
it
was
to
know
all
the
*NL*
noblemen
of
the
province
by
name
and
patronymic
,
drew
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
he
said
,
``
your
brother
's
looking
*NL*
for
you
.
They
are
voting
on
the
legal
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
walked
into
the
room
,
received
a
white
ball
,
and
followed
his
*NL*
brother
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
to
the
table
where
Sviazhsky
was
standing
*NL*
with
a
significant
and
ironical
face
,
holding
his
beard
in
his
fist
and
*NL*
sniffing
at
it
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
put
his
hand
into
the
box
,
put
the
*NL*
ball
somewhere
,
and
making
room
for
Levin
,
stopped
.
Levin
advanced
,
but
*NL*
utterly
forgetting
what
he
was
to
do
,
and
much
embarrassed
,
he
turned
to
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
with
the
question
,
``
Where
am
I
to
put
it
?
''
He
asked
*NL*
this
softly
,
at
a
moment
when
there
was
talking
going
on
near
,
so
that
*NL*
he
had
hoped
his
question
would
not
be
overheard
.
But
the
persons
*NL*
speaking
paused
,
and
his
improper
question
was
overheard
.
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
matter
for
each
man
's
own
decision
,
''
he
said
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
people
smiled
.
Levin
crimsoned
,
hurriedly
thrust
his
hand
under
*NL*
the
cloth
,
and
put
the
ball
to
the
right
as
it
was
in
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
Having
put
it
in
,
he
recollected
that
he
ought
to
have
thrust
his
left
*NL*
hand
too
,
and
so
he
thrust
it
in
though
too
late
,
and
,
still
more
*NL*
overcome
with
confusion
,
he
beat
a
hasty
retreat
into
the
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
hundred
and
twenty-six
for
admission
!
Ninety-eight
against
!
''
sang
out
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
secretary
,
who
could
not
pronounce
the
letter
_
r
_
.
Then
*NL*
there
was
a
laugh
;
a
button
and
two
nuts
were
found
in
the
box
.
The
*NL*
nobleman
was
allowed
the
right
to
vote
,
and
the
new
party
had
conquered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
old
party
did
not
consider
themselves
conquered
.
Levin
heard
*NL*
that
they
were
asking
Snetkov
to
stand
,
and
he
saw
that
a
crowd
of
*NL*
noblemen
was
surrounding
the
marshal
,
who
was
saying
something
.
Levin
*NL*
went
nearer
.
In
reply
Snetkov
spoke
of
the
trust
the
noblemen
of
the
*NL*
province
had
placed
in
him
,
the
affection
they
had
shown
him
,
which
he
*NL*
did
not
deserve
,
as
his
only
merit
had
been
his
attachment
to
the
*NL*
nobility
,
to
whom
he
had
devoted
twelve
years
of
service
.
Several
times
*NL*
he
repeated
the
words
:
``
I
have
served
to
the
best
of
my
powers
with
*NL*
truth
and
good
faith
,
I
value
your
goodness
and
thank
you
,
''
and
suddenly
*NL*
he
stopped
short
from
the
tears
that
choked
him
,
and
went
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
Whether
these
tears
came
from
a
sense
of
the
injustice
being
done
*NL*
him
,
from
his
love
for
the
nobility
,
or
from
the
strain
of
the
position
*NL*
he
was
placed
in
,
feeling
himself
surrounded
by
enemies
,
his
emotion
*NL*
infected
the
assembly
,
the
majority
were
touched
,
and
Levin
felt
a
*NL*
tenderness
for
Snetkov
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
doorway
the
marshal
of
the
province
jostled
against
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beg
pardon
,
excuse
me
,
please
,
''
he
said
as
to
a
stranger
,
but
*NL*
recognizing
Levin
,
he
smiled
timidly
.
It
seemed
to
Levin
that
he
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
say
something
,
but
could
not
speak
for
emotion
.
His
face
*NL*
and
his
whole
figure
in
his
uniform
with
the
crosses
,
and
white
trousers
*NL*
striped
with
braid
,
as
he
moved
hurriedly
along
,
reminded
Levin
of
some
*NL*
hunted
beast
who
sees
that
he
is
in
evil
case
.
This
expression
in
the
*NL*
marshal
's
face
was
particularly
touching
to
Levin
,
because
,
only
the
day
*NL*
before
,
he
had
been
at
his
house
about
his
trustee
business
and
had
seen
*NL*
him
in
all
his
grandeur
,
a
kind-hearted
,
fatherly
man
.
The
big
house
*NL*
with
the
old
family
furniture
;
the
rather
dirty
,
far
from
stylish
,
but
*NL*
respectful
footmen
,
unmistakably
old
house
serfs
who
had
stuck
to
their
*NL*
master
;
the
stout
,
good-natured
wife
in
a
cap
with
lace
and
a
Turkish
*NL*
shawl
,
petting
her
pretty
grandchild
,
her
daughter
's
daughter
;
the
young
*NL*
son
,
a
sixth
form
high
school
boy
,
coming
home
from
school
,
and
greeting
*NL*
his
father
,
kissing
his
big
hand
;
the
genuine
,
cordial
words
and
*NL*
gestures
of
the
old
man
--
all
this
had
the
day
before
roused
an
*NL*
instinctive
feeling
of
respect
and
sympathy
in
Levin
.
This
old
man
was
a
*NL*
touching
and
pathetic
figure
to
Levin
now
,
and
he
longed
to
say
*NL*
something
pleasant
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
're
sure
to
be
our
marshal
again
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
likely
,
''
said
the
marshal
,
looking
round
with
a
scared
*NL*
expression
.
``
I
'm
worn
out
,
I
'm
old
.
If
there
are
men
younger
and
more
*NL*
deserving
than
I
,
let
them
serve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
marshal
disappeared
through
a
side
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
solemn
moment
was
at
hand
.
They
were
to
proceed
immediately
to
*NL*
the
election
.
The
leaders
of
both
parties
were
reckoning
white
and
black
*NL*
on
their
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discussion
upon
Flerov
had
given
the
new
party
not
only
Flerov
's
*NL*
vote
,
but
had
also
gained
time
for
them
,
so
that
they
could
send
to
*NL*
fetch
three
noblemen
who
had
been
rendered
unable
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
elections
by
the
wiles
of
the
other
party
.
Two
noble
gentlemen
,
who
had
*NL*
a
weakness
for
strong
drink
,
had
been
made
drunk
by
the
partisans
of
*NL*
Snetkov
,
and
a
third
had
been
robbed
of
his
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
learning
this
,
the
new
party
had
made
haste
,
during
the
dispute
about
*NL*
Flerov
,
to
send
some
of
their
men
in
a
sledge
to
clothe
the
stripped
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
to
bring
along
one
of
the
intoxicated
to
the
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
one
,
drenched
him
with
water
,
''
said
the
landowner
,
who
had
*NL*
gone
on
this
errand
,
to
Sviazhsky
.
``
He
's
all
right
?
he
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
too
drunk
,
he
wo
n't
fall
down
?
''
said
Sviazhsky
,
shaking
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
's
first-rate
.
If
only
they
do
n't
give
him
any
more
here
...
I
've
*NL*
told
the
waiter
not
to
give
him
anything
on
any
account

*NL*
The
narrow
room
,
in
which
they
were
smoking
and
taking
refreshments
,
was
*NL*
full
of
noblemen
.
The
excitement
grew
more
intense
,
and
every
face
*NL*
betrayed
some
uneasiness
.
The
excitement
was
specially
keen
for
the
*NL*
leaders
of
each
party
,
who
knew
every
detail
,
and
had
reckoned
up
every
*NL*
vote
.
They
were
the
generals
organizing
the
approaching
battle
.
The
*NL*
rest
,
like
the
rank
and
file
before
an
engagement
,
though
they
were
*NL*
getting
ready
for
the
fight
,
sought
for
other
distractions
in
the
*NL*
interval
.
Some
were
lunching
,
standing
at
the
bar
,
or
sitting
at
the
*NL*
table
;
others
were
walking
up
and
down
the
long
room
,
smoking
*NL*
cigarettes
,
and
talking
with
friends
whom
they
had
not
seen
for
a
long
*NL*
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
care
to
eat
,
and
he
was
not
smoking
;
he
did
not
want
to
*NL*
join
his
own
friends
,
that
is
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
Sviazhsky
and
the
rest
,
because
Vronsky
in
his
equerry
's
uniform
was
*NL*
standing
with
them
in
eager
conversation
.
Levin
had
seen
him
already
at
*NL*
the
meeting
on
the
previous
day
,
and
he
had
studiously
avoided
him
,
not
*NL*
caring
to
greet
him
.
He
went
to
the
window
and
sat
down
,
scanning
the
*NL*
groups
,
and
listening
to
what
was
being
said
around
him

He
felt
*NL*
depressed
,
especially
because
everyone
else
was
,
as
he
saw
,
eager
,
*NL*
anxious
,
and
interested
,
and
he
alone
,
with
an
old
,
toothless
little
man
*NL*
with
mumbling
lips
wearing
a
naval
uniform
,
sitting
beside
him
,
had
no
*NL*
interest
in
it
and
nothing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
such
a
blackguard
!
I
have
told
him
so
,
but
it
makes
no
difference
.
*NL*
Only
think
of
it
!
He
could
n't
collect
it
in
three
years
!
''
he
heard
*NL*
vigorously
uttered
by
a
round-shouldered
,
short
,
country
gentleman
,
who
*NL*
had
pomaded
hair
hanging
on
his
embroidered
collar
,
and
new
boots
*NL*
obviously
put
on
for
the
occasion
,
with
heels
that
tapped
energetically
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
Casting
a
displeased
glance
at
Levin
,
this
gentleman
*NL*
sharply
turned
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
dirty
business
,
there
's
no
denying
,
''
a
small
gentleman
*NL*
assented
in
a
high
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
a
whole
crowd
of
country
gentlemen
,
surrounding
a
stout
general
,
*NL*
hurriedly
came
near
Levin
.
These
persons
were
unmistakably
seeking
a
*NL*
place
where
they
could
talk
without
being
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
he
say
I
had
his
breeches
stolen
!
Pawned
them
for
drink
,
I
*NL*
expect
.
Damn
the
fellow
,
prince
indeed
!
He
'd
better
not
say
it
,
the
*NL*
beast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
excuse
me
!
They
take
their
stand
on
the
act
,
''
was
being
said
in
*NL*
another
group
;
``
the
wife
must
be
registered
as
noble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
damn
your
acts
!
I
speak
from
my
heart
.
We
're
all
gentlemen
,
are
n't
*NL*
we
?
Above
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
on
,
your
excellency
,
_
fine
champagne
?
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
group
was
following
a
nobleman
,
who
was
shouting
something
in
a
*NL*
loud
voice
;
it
was
one
of
the
three
intoxicated
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
advised
Marya
Semyonovna
to
let
for
a
fair
rent
,
for
she
can
*NL*
never
save
a
profit
,
''
he
heard
a
pleasant
voice
say
.
The
speaker
was
a
*NL*
country
gentleman
with
gray
whiskers
,
wearing
the
regimental
uniform
of
*NL*
an
old
general
staff-officer
.
It
was
the
very
landowner
Levin
had
met
at
*NL*
Sviazhsky
's
.
He
knew
him
at
once
.
The
landowner
too
stared
at
Levin
,
and
*NL*
they
exchanged
greetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
to
see
you
!
To
be
sure
!
I
remember
you
very
well
.
Last
year
*NL*
at
our
district
marshal
,
Nikolay
Ivanovitch
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
is
your
land
doing
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
still
just
the
same
,
always
at
a
loss
,
''
the
landowner
answered
with
*NL*
a
resigned
smile
,
but
with
an
expression
of
serenity
and
conviction
that
*NL*
so
it
must
be
.
``
And
how
do
you
come
to
be
in
our
province
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
``
Come
to
take
part
in
our
_
coup
d'etat
?
_
''
he
said
,
confidently
*NL*
pronouncing
the
French
words
with
a
bad
accent
.
``
All
Russia
's
*NL*
here
--
gentlemen
of
the
bedchamber
,
and
everything
short
of
the
*NL*
ministry

''
He
pointed
to
the
imposing
figure
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
in
*NL*
white
trousers
and
his
court
uniform
,
walking
by
with
a
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
own
that
I
do
n't
very
well
understand
the
drift
of
the
*NL*
provincial
elections

said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landowner
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
is
there
to
understand
?
There
's
no
meaning
in
it
at
all
.
It
's
*NL*
a
decaying
institution
that
goes
on
running
only
by
the
force
of
*NL*
inertia
.
Just
look
,
the
very
uniforms
tell
you
that
it
's
an
assembly
of
*NL*
justices
of
the
peace
,
permanent
members
of
the
court
,
and
so
on
,
but
*NL*
not
of
noblemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
come
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
habit
,
nothing
else
.
Then
,
too
,
one
must
keep
up
connections
.
It
's
*NL*
a
moral
obligation
of
a
sort
.
And
then
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
there
's
one
's
*NL*
own
interests
.
My
son-in-law
wants
to
stand
as
a
permanent
member
;
*NL*
they
're
not
rich
people
,
and
he
must
be
brought
forward
.
These
*NL*
gentlemen
,
now
,
what
do
they
come
for
?
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
malignant
gentleman
,
who
was
talking
at
the
high
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
new
generation
of
nobility
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
New
it
may
be
,
but
nobility
it
is
n't
.
They
're
proprietors
of
a
sort
,
*NL*
but
we
're
the
landowners
.
As
noblemen
,
they
're
cutting
their
own
*NL*
throats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
it
's
an
institution
that
's
served
its
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
may
be
,
but
still
it
ought
to
be
treated
a
little
more
*NL*
respectfully

Snetkov
,
now
...
We
may
be
of
use
,
or
we
may
not
,
but
*NL*
we
're
the
growth
of
a
thousand
years

If
we
're
laying
out
a
garden

*NL*
planning
one
before
the
house

you
know
,
and
there
you

a
tree

stood
for
centuries
in
the
very
spot

Old
and
gnarled
it
may
be
,
and
*NL*
yet
you
do
n't
cut
down
the
old
fellow
to
make
room
for
the
flowerbeds
,
*NL*
but
lay
out
your
beds
so
as
to
take
advantage
of
the
tree
.
You
wo
n't
*NL*
grow
him
again
in
a
year
,
''
he
said
cautiously
,
and
he
immediately
*NL*
changed
the
conversation
.
``
Well
,
and
how
is
your
land
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
very
well

I
make
five
per
cent

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
do
n't
reckon
your
own
work

Are
n't
you
worth
something
*NL*
too
?
I
'll
tell
you
my
own
case
.
Before
I
took
to
seeing
after
the
land
,
*NL*
I
had
a
salary
of
three
hundred
pounds
from
the
service
.
Now
I
do
more
*NL*
work
than
I
did
in
the
service
,
and
like
you
I
get
five
per
cent
.
on
the
*NL*
land
,
and
thank
God
for
that
.
But
one
's
work
is
thrown
in
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
do
it
,
if
it
's
a
clear
loss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
one
does
it
!
What
would
you
have
?
It
's
habit
,
and
one
knows
*NL*
it
's
how
it
should
be
.
And
what
's
more
,
''
the
landowner
went
on
,
leaning
*NL*
his
elbows
on
the
window
and
chatting
on
,
``
my
son
,
I
must
tell
you
,
has
*NL*
no
taste
for
it
.
There
's
no
doubt
he
'll
be
a
scientific
man
.
So
there
'll
*NL*
be
no
one
to
keep
it
up
.
And
yet
one
does
it
.
Here
this
year
I
've
*NL*
planted
an
orchard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Levin
,
``
that
's
perfectly
true
.
I
always
feel
there
's
no
*NL*
real
balance
of
gain
in
my
work
on
the
land
,
and
yet
one
does
it
...
*NL*
It
's
a
sort
of
duty
one
feels
to
the
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
tell
you
what
,
''
the
landowner
pursued
;
``
a
neighbor
of
mine
,
a
*NL*
merchant
,
was
at
my
place
.
We
walked
about
the
fields
and
the
garden
.
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
he
,
`
Stepan
Vassilievitch
,
everything
's
well
looked
after
,
*NL*
but
your
garden
's
neglected
.
'
But
,
as
a
fact
,
it
's
well
kept
up
.
`
To
my
*NL*
thinking
,
I
'd
cut
down
that
lime-tree
.
Here
you
've
thousands
of
limes
,
*NL*
and
each
would
make
two
good
bundles
of
bark
.
And
nowadays
that
bark
's
*NL*
worth
something
.
I
'd
cut
down
the
lot
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
what
he
made
he
'd
increase
his
stock
,
or
buy
some
land
for
a
*NL*
trifle
,
and
let
it
out
in
lots
to
the
peasants
,
''
Levin
added
,
smiling
.
*NL*
He
had
evidently
more
than
once
come
across
those
commercial
*NL*
calculations
.
``
And
he
'd
make
his
fortune
.
But
you
and
I
must
thank
God
*NL*
if
we
keep
what
we
've
got
and
leave
it
to
our
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
married
,
I
've
heard
?
''
said
the
landowner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
Levin
answered
,
with
proud
satisfaction
.
``
Yes
,
it
's
rather
*NL*
strange
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
So
we
live
without
making
anything
,
as
though
we
*NL*
were
ancient
vestals
set
to
keep
in
a
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landowner
chuckled
under
his
white
mustaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
among
us
,
too
,
like
our
friend
Nikolay
Ivanovitch
,
or
*NL*
Count
Vronsky
,
that
's
settled
here
lately
,
who
try
to
carry
on
their
*NL*
husbandry
as
though
it
were
a
factory
;
but
so
far
it
leads
to
nothing
*NL*
but
making
away
with
capital
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
is
it
we
do
n't
do
like
the
merchants
?
Why
do
n't
we
cut
down
our
*NL*
parks
for
timber
?
''
said
Levin
,
returning
to
a
thought
that
had
struck
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
you
said
,
to
keep
the
fire
in
.
Besides
that
's
not
work
for
a
*NL*
nobleman
.
And
our
work
as
noblemen
is
n't
done
here
at
the
elections
,
but
*NL*
yonder
,
each
in
our
corner
.
There
's
a
class
instinct
,
too
,
of
what
one
*NL*
ought
and
ought
n't
to
do
.
There
's
the
peasants
,
too
,
I
wonder
at
them
*NL*
sometimes
;
any
good
peasant
tries
to
take
all
the
land
he
can
.
However
*NL*
bad
the
land
is
,
he
'll
work
it
.
Without
a
return
too

At
a
simple
loss

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
we
do
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
Very
,
very
glad
to
have
met
you

he
*NL*
added
,
seeing
Sviazhsky
approaching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
we
've
met
for
the
first
time
since
we
met
at
your
place

said
*NL*
the
landowner
to
Sviazhsky
,
``
and
we
've
had
a
good
talk
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

have
you
been
attacking
the
new

Sviazhsky
*NL*
with
a

Chapter
30
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
took
Levin
's
arm
,
and
went
with
him
to
his
own
friends
.
This
*NL*
time
there
was
no
avoiding
Vronsky
.
He
was
standing
with
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
looking
straight
at
Levin
as
he
*NL*
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Delighted
!
I
believe
I
've
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
...
at
*NL*
Princess
Shtcherbatskaya
's
,
''
he
said
,
giving
Levin
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
quite
remember
our
meeting
,
''
said
Levin
,
and
blushing
crimson
,
*NL*
he
turned
away
immediately
,
and
began
talking
to
his
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slight
smile
Vronsky
went
on
talking
to
Sviazhsky
,
obviously
*NL*
without
the
slightest
inclination
to
enter
into
conversation
with
Levin
.
*NL*
But
Levin
,
as
he
talked
to
his
brother
,
was
continually
looking
round
at
*NL*
Vronsky
,
trying
to
think
of
something
to
say
to
him
to
gloss
over
his
*NL*
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
waiting
for
now
?

asked
Levin
,
looking
at
Sviazhsky
and
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Snetkov
.
He
has
to
refuse
or
to
consent
to
stand

answered
*NL*
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
has
he
done
,
consented
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
point
,
that
he
's
done
neither

said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
refuses
,
who
will
stand
then

''
asked
Levin
,
looking
at
*NL*
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoever
chooses
to
,

said
Sviazhsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
I
,
''
said
Sviazhsky
,
looking
confused
,
and
turning
an
*NL*
alarmed
glance
at
the
malignant
gentleman
,
who
was
standing
beside
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
then
?
Nevyedovsky
?
''
said
Levin
,
feeling
he
was
putting
his
foot
*NL*
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
worse
still
.
Nevyedovsky
and
Sviazhsky
were
the
two
*NL*
candidates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
shall
not
,
under
any
circumstances

''
answered
the
malignant
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Nevyedovsky
himself
.
Sviazhsky
introduced
him
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
find
it
exciting
too
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
winking
at
*NL*
Vronsky
.
``
It
's
something
like
a
race

One
might
bet
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
is
keenly
exciting

said
Vronsky
.
``
And
once
taking
the
thing
*NL*
up

one
's
eager
to
see
it
through

It

a
fight

he
said
,
scowling
and
*NL*
setting
his
powerful
jaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

Sviazhsky

,
yes
!
''
Vronsky
assented
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
followed
,
during
which
Vronsky
--
since
he
had
to
look
at
*NL*
something
--
looked
at
Levin
,
at
his
feet
,
at
his
uniform
,
then
at
his
*NL*
face
,
and
noticing
his
gloomy
eyes
fixed
upon
him
,
he
said
,
in
order
to
*NL*
say
something
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
that
you
,
living
constantly
in
the
country
,
are
not
a
justice
*NL*
of
the
peace
?
You
are
not
in
the
uniform
of
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
I
consider
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
is
a
silly
*NL*
institution
,
''
Levin
answered
gloomily
.
He
had
been
all
the
time
looking
*NL*
for
an
opportunity
to
enter
into
conversation
with
Vronsky
,
so
as
to
*NL*
smooth
over
his
rudeness
at
their
first
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
,
quite
the
contrary
,
''
Vronsky
said
,
with
quiet
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
plaything
,
''
Levin
cut
him
short
.
``
We
do
n't
want
justices
of
the
*NL*
peace
.
I
've
never
had
a
single
thing
to
do
with
them
during
eight
years
.
*NL*
And
what
I
have
had
was
decided
wrongly
by
them
.
The
justice
of
the
*NL*
peace
is
over
thirty
miles
from
me
.
For
some
matter
of
two
roubles
I
*NL*
should
have
to
send
a
lawyer
,
who
costs
me
fifteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
related
how
a
peasant
had
stolen
some
flour
from
the
miller
,
and
*NL*
when
the
miller
told
him
of
it
,
had
lodged
a
complaint
for
slander
.
All
*NL*
this
was
utterly
uncalled
for
and
stupid
,
and
Levin
felt
it
himself
as
*NL*
he
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
such
an
original
fellow
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
his
*NL*
most
soothing
,
almond-oil
smile
.
``
But
come
along
;
I
think
they
're
*NL*
voting
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
separated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
understand
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
had
observed
his
*NL*
brother
's
clumsiness
,
``
I
ca
n't
understand
how
anyone
can
be
so
*NL*
absolutely
devoid
of
political
tact
.
That
's
where
we
Russians
are
so
*NL*
deficient
.
The
marshal
of
the
province
is
our
opponent
,
and
with
him
*NL*
you
're
_
ami
cochon
_
,
and
you
beg
him
to
stand
.
Count
Vronsky
,
now
...
*NL*
I
'm
not
making
a
friend
of
him
;
he
's
asked
me
to
dinner
,
and
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
;
but
he
's
one
of
our
side
--
why
make
an
enemy
of
him
?
Then
you
ask
*NL*
Nevyedovsky
if
he
's
going
to
stand
.
That
's
not
a
thing
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
understand
it
at
all
!
And
it
's
all
such
nonsense
,
''
Levin
*NL*
answered
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
it
's
all
such
nonsense
,
but
as
soon
as
you
have
anything
to
do
*NL*
with
it
,
you
make
a
muddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
not
answer
,
and
they
walked
together
into
the
big
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marshal
of
the
province
,
though
he
was
vaguely
conscious
in
the
air
*NL*
of
some
trap
being
prepared
for
him
,
and
though
he
had
not
been
called
*NL*
upon
by
all
to
stand
,
had
still
made
up
his
mind
to
stand
.
All
was
*NL*
silence
in
the
room
.
The
secretary
announced
in
a
loud
voice
that
the
*NL*
captain
of
the
guards
,
Mihail
Stepanovitch
Snetkov
,
would
now
be
*NL*
balloted
for
as
marshal
of
the
province
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
district
marshals
walked
carrying
plates
,
on
which
were
balls
,
from
*NL*
their
tables
to
the
high
table
,
and
the
election
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
it
in
the
right
side
,
''
whispered
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
with
his
*NL*
brother
Levin
followed
the
marshal
of
his
district
to
the
table
.
But
*NL*
Levin
had
forgotten
by
now
the
calculations
that
had
been
explained
to
*NL*
him
,
and
was
afraid
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
might
be
mistaken
in
saying
``
the
*NL*
right
side
.
''
Surely
Snetkov
was
the
enemy
.
As
he
went
up
,
he
held
the
*NL*
ball
in
his
right
hand
,
but
thinking
he
was
wrong
,
just
at
the
box
he
*NL*
changed
to
the
left
hand
,
and
undoubtedly
put
the
ball
to
the
left
.
An
*NL*
adept
in
the
business
,
standing
at
the
box
and
seeing
by
the
mere
action
*NL*
of
the
elbow
where
each
put
his
ball
,
scowled
with
annoyance
.
It
was
no
*NL*
good
for
him
to
use
his
insight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
still
,
and
the
counting
of
the
balls
was
heard
.
Then
a
*NL*
single
voice
rose
and
proclaimed
the
numbers
for
and
against
.
The
*NL*
marshal
had
been
voted
for
by
a
considerable
majority
.
All
was
noise
and
*NL*
eager
movement
towards
the
doors
.
Snetkov
came
in
,
and
the
nobles
*NL*
thronged
round
him
,
congratulating
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
is
it
over
?
''
Levin
asked
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
just
beginning
,
''
Sviazhsky
said
,
replying
for
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
with
a
smile
.
``
Some
other
candidate
may
receive
more
votes
*NL*
than
the
marshal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
quite
forgotten
about
that
.
Now
he
could
only
remember
that
*NL*
there
was
some
sort
of
trickery
in
it
,
but
he
was
too
bored
to
think
*NL*
what
it
was
exactly
.
He
felt
depressed
,
and
longed
to
get
out
of
the
*NL*
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
no
one
was
paying
any
attention
to
him
,
and
no
one
apparently
needed
*NL*
him
,
he
quietly
slipped
away
into
the
little
room
where
the
refreshments
*NL*
were
,
and
again
had
a
great
sense
of
comfort
when
he
saw
the
waiters
.
*NL*
The
little
old
waiter
pressed
him
to
have
something
,
and
Levin
agreed
.
*NL*
After
eating
a
cutlet
with
beans
and
talking
to
the
waiters
of
their
*NL*
former
masters
,
Levin
,
not
wishing
to
go
back
to
the
hall
,
where
it
was
*NL*
all
so
distasteful
to
him
,
proceeded
to
walk
through
the
galleries
.
The
*NL*
galleries
were
full
of
fashionably
dressed
ladies
,
leaning
over
the
*NL*
balustrade
and
trying
not
to
lose
a
single
word
of
what
was
being
said
*NL*
below
.
With
the
ladies
were
sitting
and
standing
smart
lawyers
,
high
*NL*
school
teachers
in
spectacles
,
and
officers
.
Everywhere
they
were
*NL*
talking
of
the
election
,
and
of
how
worried
the
marshal
was
,
and
how
*NL*
splendid
the
discussions
had
been
.
In
one
group
Levin
heard
his
*NL*
brother
's
praises
.
One
lady
was
telling
a
lawyer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
I
heard
Koznishev
!
It
's
worth
losing
one
's
dinner
.
He
's
*NL*
exquisite
!
So
clear
and
distinct
all
of
it
!
There
's
not
one
of
you
in
*NL*
the
law
courts
that
speaks
like
that
.
The
only
one
is
Meidel
,
and
he
's
*NL*
not
so
eloquent
by
a
long
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finding
a
free
place
,
Levin
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
began
looking
*NL*
and
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
noblemen
were
sitting
railed
off
behind
barriers
according
to
*NL*
their
districts
.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
man
in
a
uniform
,
who
*NL*
shouted
in
a
loud
,
high
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
candidate
for
the
marshalship
of
the
nobility
of
the
province
we
*NL*
call
upon
staff-captain
Yevgeney
Ivanovitch
Apuhtin
!
''
A
dead
silence
*NL*
followed
,
and
then
a
weak
old
voice
was
heard
:
``
Declined
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
call
upon
the
privy
councilor
Pyotr
Petrovitch
Bol
,
''
the
voice
began
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Declined
!
''
a
high
boyish
voice
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
it
began
,
and
again
``
Declined
.
''
And
so
it
went
on
for
about
an
*NL*
hour
.
Levin
,
with
his
elbows
on
the
balustrade
,
looked
and
listened
.
At
*NL*
first
he
wondered
and
wanted
to
know
what
it
meant
;
then
feeling
sure
*NL*
that
he
could
not
make
it
out
he
began
to
be
bored
.
Then
recalling
all
*NL*
the
excitement
and
vindictiveness
he
had
seen
on
all
the
faces
,
he
felt
*NL*
sad
;
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
,
and
went
downstairs
.
As
he
passed
*NL*
through
the
entry
to
the
galleries
he
met
a
dejected
high
school
boy
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
with
tired-looking
eyes
.
On
the
stairs
he
met
a
*NL*
couple
--
a
lady
running
quickly
on
her
high
heels
and
the
jaunty
deputy
*NL*
prosecutor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
you
were
n't
late
,
''
the
deputy
prosecutor
was
saying
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
Levin
moved
aside
to
let
the
lady
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
on
the
stairs
to
the
way
out
,
and
was
just
feeling
in
his
*NL*
waistcoat
pocket
for
the
number
of
his
overcoat
,
when
the
secretary
*NL*
overtook
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
way
,
please
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
;
they
are
voting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
candidate
who
was
being
voted
on
was
Nevyedovsky
,
who
had
so
stoutly
*NL*
denied
all
idea
of
standing
.
Levin
went
up
to
the
door
of
the
room
;
it
*NL*
was
locked
.
The
secretary
knocked
,
the
door
opened
,
and
Levin
was
met
by
*NL*
two
red-faced
gentlemen
,
who
darted
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
any
more
of
it
,
''
said
one
red-faced
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
them
the
face
of
the
marshal
of
the
province
was
poked
out
.
His
*NL*
face
was
dreadful-looking
from
exhaustion
and
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
not
to
let
any
one
out
!
''
he
cried
to
the
doorkeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
let
someone
in
,
your
excellency
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
''
and
with
a
heavy
sigh
the
marshal
of
the
province
walked
*NL*
with
downcast
head
to
the
high
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
his
legs
*NL*
staggering
in
his
white
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevyedovsky
had
scored
a
higher
majority
,
as
they
had
planned
,
and
he
*NL*
was
the
new
marshal
of
the
province
.
Many
people
were
amused
,
many
were
*NL*
pleased
and
happy
,
many
were
in
ecstasies
,
many
were
disgusted
and
*NL*
unhappy
.
The
former
marshal
of
the
province
was
in
a
state
of
despair
,
*NL*
which
he
could
not
conceal
.
When
Nevyedovsky
went
out
of
the
room
,
the
*NL*
crowd
thronged
round
him
and
followed
him
enthusiastically
,
just
as
they
*NL*
had
followed
the
governor
who
had
opened
the
meetings
,
and
just
as
they
*NL*
had
followed
Snetkov
when
he
was
elected
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
newly
elected
marshal
and
many
of
the
successful
party
dined
that
*NL*
day
with
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
had
come
to
the
elections
partly
because
he
was
bored
in
the
*NL*
country
and
wanted
to
show
Anna
his
right
to
independence
,
and
also
to
*NL*
repay
Sviazhsky
by
his
support
at
the
election
for
all
the
trouble
he
*NL*
had
taken
for
Vronsky
at
the
district
council
election
,
but
chiefly
in
*NL*
order
strictly
to
perform
all
those
duties
of
a
nobleman
and
landowner
*NL*
which
he
had
taken
upon
himself
.
But
he
had
not
in
the
least
expected
*NL*
that
the
election
would
so
interest
him
,
so
keenly
excite
him
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
be
so
good
at
this
kind
of
thing
.
He
was
quite
a
new
man
in
the
*NL*
circle
of
the
nobility
of
the
province
,
but
his
success
was
*NL*
unmistakable
,
and
he
was
not
wrong
in
supposing
that
he
had
already
*NL*
obtained
a
certain
influence
.
This
influence
was
due
to
his
wealth
and
*NL*
reputation
,
the
capital
house
in
the
town
lent
him
by
his
old
friend
*NL*
Shirkov
,
who
had
a
post
in
the
department
of
finances
and
was
director
*NL*
of
a
flourishing
bank
in
Kashin
;
the
excellent
cook
Vronsky
had
brought
*NL*
from
the
country
,
and
his
friendship
with
the
governor
,
who
was
a
*NL*
schoolfellow
of
Vronsky
's
--
a
schoolfellow
he
had
patronized
and
*NL*
protected
indeed
.
But
what
contributed
more
than
all
to
his
success
was
*NL*
his
direct
,
equable
manner
with
everyone
,
which
very
quickly
made
the
*NL*
majority
of
the
noblemen
reverse
the
current
opinion
of
his
supposed
*NL*
haughtiness
.
He
was
himself
conscious
that
,
except
that
whimsical
*NL*
gentleman
married
to
Kitty
Shtcherbatskaya
,
who
had
_
a
propos
de
bottes
_
*NL*
poured
out
a
stream
of
irrelevant
absurdities
with
such
spiteful
fury
,
*NL*
every
nobleman
with
whom
he
had
made
acquaintance
had
become
his
*NL*
adherent
.
He
saw
clearly
,
and
other
people
recognized
it
,
too
,
that
he
*NL*
had
done
a
great
deal
to
secure
the
success
of
Nevyedovsky
.
And
now
at
*NL*
his
own
table
,
celebrating
Nevyedovsky
's
election
,
he
was
experiencing
*NL*
an
agreeable
sense
of
triumph
over
the
success
of
his
candidate
.
The
*NL*
election
itself
had
so
fascinated
him
that
,
if
he
could
succeed
in
*NL*
getting
married
during
the
next
three
years
,
he
began
to
think
of
*NL*
standing
himself
--
much
as
after
winning
a
race
ridden
by
a
jockey
,
he
*NL*
had
longed
to
ride
a
race
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Today
he
was
celebrating
the
success
of
his
jockey
.
Vronsky
sat
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
table
,
on
his
right
hand
sat
the
young
governor
,
a
general
*NL*
of
high
rank
.
To
all
the
rest
he
was
the
chief
man
in
the
province
,
who
*NL*
had
solemnly
opened
the
elections
with
his
speech
,
and
aroused
a
feeling
*NL*
of
respect
and
even
of
awe
in
many
people
,
as
Vronsky
saw
;
to
Vronsky
he
*NL*
was
little
Katka
Maslov
--
that
had
been
his
nickname
in
the
Pages
'
*NL*
Corps
--
whom
he
felt
to
be
shy
and
tried
to
_
mettre
a
son
aise
_
.
On
the
*NL*
left
hand
sat
Nevyedovsky
with
his
youthful
,
stubborn
,
and
malignant
*NL*
face
.
With
him
Vronsky
was
simple
and
deferential
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sviazhsky
took
his
failure
very
light-heartedly
.
It
was
indeed
no
*NL*
failure
in
his
eyes
,
as
he
said
himself
,
turning
,
glass
in
hand
,
to
*NL*
Nevyedovsky
;
they
could
not
have
found
a
better
representative
of
the
*NL*
new
movement
,
which
the
nobility
ought
to
follow
.
And
so
every
honest
*NL*
person
,
as
he
said
,
was
on
the
side
of
today
's
success
and
was
rejoicing
*NL*
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
glad
,
too
,
that
he
was
having
a
good
time
,
and
*NL*
that
everyone
was
pleased
.
The
episode
of
the
elections
served
as
a
good
*NL*
occasion
for
a
capital
dinner
.
Sviazhsky
comically
imitated
the
tearful
*NL*
discourse
of
the
marshal
,
and
observed
,
addressing
Nevyedovsky
,
that
his
*NL*
excellency
would
have
to
select
another
more
complicated
method
of
*NL*
auditing
the
accounts
than
tears
.
Another
nobleman
jocosely
described
*NL*
how
footmen
in
stockings
had
been
ordered
for
the
marshal
's
ball
,
and
*NL*
how
now
they
would
have
to
be
sent
back
unless
the
new
marshal
would
*NL*
give
a
ball
with
footmen
in
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Continually
during
dinner
they
said
of
Nevyedovsky
:
``
our
marshal
,
''
and
*NL*
``
your
excellency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
said
with
the
same
pleasure
with
which
a
bride
is
called
*NL*
``
Madame
''
and
her
husband
's
name
.
Nevyedovsky
affected
to
be
not
merely
*NL*
indifferent
but
scornful
of
this
appellation
,
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
*NL*
was
highly
delighted
,
and
had
to
keep
a
curb
on
himself
not
to
betray
*NL*
the
triumph
which
was
unsuitable
to
their
new
liberal
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
several
telegrams
were
sent
to
people
interested
in
the
*NL*
result
of
the
election
.
And
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
was
in
high
good
*NL*
humor
,
sent
Darya
Alexandrovna
a
telegram
:
``
Nevyedovsky
elected
by
*NL*
twenty
votes
.
Congratulations
.
Tell
people
.
''
He
dictated
it
aloud
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
We
must
let
them
share
our
rejoicing
.
''
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
*NL*
getting
the
message
,
simply
sighed
over
the
rouble
wasted
on
it
,
and
*NL*
understood
that
it
was
an
after-dinner
affair
.
She
knew
Stiva
had
a
*NL*
weakness
after
dining
for
_
faire
jouer
le
telegraphe
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
,
together
with
the
excellent
dinner
and
the
wine
,
not
from
*NL*
Russian
merchants
,
but
imported
direct
from
abroad
,
was
extremely
*NL*
dignified
,
simple
,
and
enjoyable
.
The
party
--
some
twenty
--
had
been
*NL*
selected
by
Sviazhsky
from
among
the
more
active
new
liberals
,
all
of
*NL*
the
same
way
of
thinking
,
who
were
at
the
same
time
clever
and
well
*NL*
bred
.
They
drank
,
also
half
in
jest
,
to
the
health
of
the
new
marshal
of
*NL*
the
province
,
of
the
governor
,
of
the
bank
director
,
and
of
``
our
amiable
*NL*
host
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
satisfied
.
He
had
never
expected
to
find
so
pleasant
a
tone
*NL*
in
the
provinces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
dinner
it
was
still
more
lively
.
The
governor
asked
*NL*
Vronsky
to
come
to
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
the
Servians
which
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
was
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance
,
had
been
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
'll
be
a
ball
,
and
you
'll
see
the
belle
of
the
province
.
Worth
*NL*
seeing
,
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
my
line
,
''
Vronsky
answered
.
He
liked
that
English
phrase
.
But
he
*NL*
smiled
,
and
promised
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
rose
from
the
table
,
when
all
of
them
were
smoking
,
*NL*
Vronsky
's
valet
went
up
to
him
with
a
letter
on
a
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Vozdvizhenskoe
by
special
messenger
,
''
he
said
with
a
significant
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Astonishing
!
how
like
he
is
to
the
deputy
prosecutor
Sventitsky
,
''
said
*NL*
one
of
the
guests
in
French
of
the
valet
,
while
Vronsky
,
frowning
,
read
*NL*
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
from
Anna
.
Before
he
read
the
letter
,
he
knew
its
*NL*
contents
.
Expecting
the
elections
to
be
over
in
five
days
,
he
had
*NL*
promised
to
be
back
on
Friday
.
Today
was
Saturday
,
and
he
knew
that
the
*NL*
letter
contained
reproaches
for
not
being
back
at
the
time
fixed
.
The
*NL*
letter
he
had
sent
the
previous
evening
had
probably
not
reached
her
*NL*
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
what
he
had
expected
,
but
the
form
of
it
was
unexpected
,
*NL*
and
particularly
disagreeable
to
him
.
``
Annie
is
very
ill
,
the
doctor
*NL*
says
it
may
be
inflammation
.
I
am
losing
my
head
all
alone
.
Princess
*NL*
Varvara
is
no
help
,
but
a
hindrance
.
I
expected
you
the
day
before
*NL*
yesterday
,
and
yesterday
,
and
now
I
am
sending
to
find
out
where
you
are
*NL*
and
what
you
are
doing
.
I
wanted
to
come
myself
,
but
thought
better
of
*NL*
it
,
knowing
you
would
dislike
it
.
Send
some
answer
,
that
I
may
know
what
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
ill
,
yet
she
had
thought
of
coming
herself
.
Their
daughter
*NL*
ill
,
and
this
hostile
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
innocent
festivities
over
the
election
,
and
this
gloomy
,
burdensome
*NL*
love
to
which
he
had
to
return
struck
Vronsky
by
their
contrast
.
But
he
*NL*
had
to
go
,
and
by
the
first
train
that
night
he
set
off
home
.

Chapter
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Vronsky
's
departure
for
the
elections
,
Anna
had
reflected
that
*NL*
the
scenes
constantly
repeated
between
them
each
time
he
left
home
,
*NL*
might
only
make
him
cold
to
her
instead
of
attaching
him
to
her
,
and
*NL*
resolved
to
do
all
she
could
to
control
herself
so
as
to
bear
the
*NL*
parting
with
composure
.
But
the
cold
,
severe
glance
with
which
he
had
*NL*
looked
at
her
when
he
came
to
tell
her
he
was
going
had
wounded
her
,
and
*NL*
before
he
had
started
her
peace
of
mind
was
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
solitude
afterwards
,
thinking
over
that
glance
which
had
expressed
*NL*
his
right
to
freedom
,
she
came
,
as
she
always
did
,
to
the
same
*NL*
point
--
the
sense
of
her
own
humiliation
.
``
He
has
the
right
to
go
away
*NL*
when
and
where
he
chooses
.
Not
simply
to
go
away
,
but
to
leave
me
.
He
*NL*
has
every
right
,
and
I
have
none
.
But
knowing
that
,
he
ought
not
to
do
*NL*
it
.
What
has
he
done
,
though
?
...
He
looked
at
me
with
a
cold
,
severe
*NL*
expression
.
Of
course
that
is
something
indefinable
,
impalpable
,
but
it
*NL*
has
never
been
so
before
,
and
that
glance
means
a
great
deal
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
``
That
glance
shows
the
beginning
of
indifference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
she
felt
sure
that
a
coldness
was
beginning
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
she
could
do
,
she
could
not
in
any
way
alter
her
relations
to
*NL*
him
.
Just
as
before
,
only
by
love
and
by
charm
could
she
keep
him
.
And
*NL*
so
,
just
as
before
,
only
by
occupation
in
the
day
,
by
morphine
at
night
,
*NL*
could
she
stifle
the
fearful
thought
of
what
would
be
if
he
ceased
to
*NL*
love
her
.
It
is
true
there
was
still
one
means
;
not
to
keep
him
--
for
*NL*
that
she
wanted
nothing
more
than
his
love
--
but
to
be
nearer
to
him
,
to
*NL*
be
in
such
a
position
that
he
would
not
leave
her
.
That
means
was
*NL*
divorce
and
marriage
.
And
she
began
to
long
for
that
,
and
made
up
her
*NL*
mind
to
agree
to
it
the
first
time
he
or
Stiva
approached
her
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absorbed
in
such
thoughts
,
she
passed
five
days
without
him
,
the
five
*NL*
days
that
he
was
to
be
at
the
elections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walks
,
conversation
with
Princess
Varvara
,
visits
to
the
hospital
,
and
,
*NL*
most
of
all
,
reading
--
reading
of
one
book
after
another
--
filled
up
her
*NL*
time
.
But
on
the
sixth
day
,
when
the
coachman
came
back
without
him
,
she
*NL*
felt
that
now
she
was
utterly
incapable
of
stifling
the
thought
of
him
*NL*
and
of
what
he
was
doing
there
,
just
at
that
time
her
little
girl
was
*NL*
taken
ill
.
Anna
began
to
look
after
her
,
but
even
that
did
not
distract
*NL*
her
mind
,
especially
as
the
illness
was
not
serious
.
However
hard
she
*NL*
tried
,
she
could
not
love
this
little
child
,
and
to
feign
love
was
*NL*
beyond
her
powers
.
Towards
the
evening
of
that
day
,
still
alone
,
Anna
*NL*
was
in
such
a
panic
about
him
that
she
decided
to
start
for
the
town
,
*NL*
but
on
second
thoughts
wrote
him
the
contradictory
letter
that
Vronsky
*NL*
received
,
and
without
reading
it
through
,
sent
it
off
by
a
special
*NL*
messenger
.
The
next
morning
she
received
his
letter
and
regretted
her
*NL*
own
.
She
dreaded
a
repetition
of
the
severe
look
he
had
flung
at
her
at
*NL*
parting
,
especially
when
he
knew
that
the
baby
was
not
dangerously
ill
.
*NL*
But
still
she
was
glad
she
had
written
to
him
.
At
this
moment
Anna
was
*NL*
positively
admitting
to
herself
that
she
was
a
burden
to
him
,
that
he
*NL*
would
relinquish
his
freedom
regretfully
to
return
to
her
,
and
in
spite
*NL*
of
that
she
was
glad
he
was
coming
.
Let
him
weary
of
her
,
but
he
would
*NL*
be
here
with
her
,
so
that
she
would
see
him
,
would
know
of
every
action
*NL*
he
took
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
in
the
drawing
room
near
a
lamp
,
with
a
new
volume
of
*NL*
Taine
,
and
as
she
read
,
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
wind
outside
,
and
*NL*
every
minute
expecting
the
carriage
to
arrive
.
Several
times
she
had
*NL*
fancied
she
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
,
but
she
had
been
mistaken
.
At
*NL*
last
she
heard
not
the
sound
of
wheels
,
but
the
coachman
's
shout
and
the
*NL*
dull
rumble
in
the
covered
entry
.
Even
Princess
Varvara
,
playing
*NL*
patience
,
confirmed
this
,
and
Anna
,
flushing
hotly
,
got
up
;
but
instead
*NL*
of
going
down
,
as
she
had
done
twice
before
,
she
stood
still
.
She
*NL*
suddenly
felt
ashamed
of
her
duplicity
,
but
even
more
she
dreaded
how
he
*NL*
might
meet
her
.
All
feeling
of
wounded
pride
had
passed
now
;
she
was
*NL*
only
afraid
of
the
expression
of
his
displeasure
.
She
remembered
that
*NL*
her
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again
for
the
last
two
days
.
She
felt
*NL*
positively
vexed
with
her
for
getting
better
from
the
very
moment
her
*NL*
letter
was
sent
off
.
Then
she
thought
of
him
,
that
he
was
here
,
all
of
*NL*
him
,
with
his
hands
,
his
eyes
.
She
heard
his
voice
.
And
forgetting
*NL*
everything
,
she
ran
joyfully
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
is
Annie
?
''
he
said
timidly
from
below
,
looking
up
to
Anna
as
*NL*
she
ran
down
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
on
a
chair
,
and
a
footman
was
pulling
off
his
warm
*NL*
over-boot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
is
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
he
said
,
shaking
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
,
and
drew
it
to
her
waist
,
never
*NL*
taking
her
eyes
off
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
,
''
he
said
,
coldly
scanning
her
,
her
hair
,
her
dress
,
*NL*
which
he
knew
she
had
put
on
for
him
.
All
was
charming
,
but
how
many
*NL*
times
it
had
charmed
him
!
And
the
stern
,
stony
expression
that
she
so
*NL*
dreaded
settled
upon
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
.
And
are
you
well
?
''
he
said
,
wiping
his
damp
beard
with
*NL*
his
handkerchief
and
kissing
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
she
thought
,
``
only
let
him
be
here
,
and
so
long
as
he
's
*NL*
here
he
can
not
,
he
dare
not
,
cease
to
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
spent
happily
and
gaily
in
the
presence
of
Princess
*NL*
Varvara
,
who
complained
to
him
that
Anna
had
been
taking
morphine
in
his
*NL*
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
?
I
could
n't
sleep
...
My
thoughts
prevented
me
.
When
*NL*
he
's
here
I
never
take
it
--
hardly
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
about
the
election
,
and
Anna
knew
how
by
adroit
questions
to
*NL*
bring
him
to
what
gave
him
most
pleasure
--
his
own
success
.
She
told
him
*NL*
of
everything
that
interested
him
at
home
;
and
all
that
she
told
him
was
*NL*
of
the
most
cheerful
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
late
in
the
evening
,
when
they
were
alone
,
Anna
,
seeing
that
she
had
*NL*
regained
complete
possession
of
him
,
wanted
to
erase
the
painful
*NL*
impression
of
the
glance
he
had
given
her
for
her
letter
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
frankly
,
you
were
vexed
at
getting
my
letter
,
and
you
did
n't
*NL*
believe
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
had
said
it
,
she
felt
that
however
warm
his
feelings
were
*NL*
to
her
,
he
had
not
forgiven
her
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
letter
was
so
strange
.
First
,
Annie
ill
,
and
then
*NL*
you
thought
of
coming
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
all
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
doubt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
doubt
it
.
You
are
vexed
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
one
moment
.
I
'm
only
vexed
,
that
's
true
,
that
you
seem
somehow
*NL*
unwilling
to
admit
that
there
are
duties
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
duty
of
going
to
a
concert
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
wo
n't
talk
about
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
talk
about
it
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
meant
to
say
that
matters
of
real
importance
may
turn
up
.
Now
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
I
shall
have
to
go
to
Moscow
to
arrange
about
the
*NL*
house
...
Oh
,
Anna
,
why
are
you
so
irritable
?
Do
n't
you
know
that
I
*NL*
ca
n't
live
without
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
''
said
Anna
,
her
voice
suddenly
changing
,
``
it
means
that
you
are
*NL*
sick
of
this
life
...
Yes
,
you
will
come
for
a
day
and
go
away
,
as
men
*NL*
do
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
that
's
cruel
.
I
am
ready
to
give
up
my
whole
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
go
to
Moscow
,
I
will
go
too
.
I
will
not
stay
here
.
Either
we
*NL*
must
separate
or
else
live
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
,
that
's
my
one
desire
.
But
for
that
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
get
a
divorce
.
I
will
write
to
him
.
I
see
I
can
not
go
on
like
*NL*
this
...
But
I
will
come
with
you
to
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
as
if
you
were
threatening
me
.
But
I
desire
nothing
so
much
as
*NL*
never
to
be
parted
from
you
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
said
these
words
there
gleamed
in
his
eyes
not
merely
a
cold
*NL*
look
,
but
the
vindictive
look
of
a
man
persecuted
and
made
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
look
and
correctly
divined
its
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
it
's
a
calamity
!
''
that
glance
told
her
.
It
was
a
moment
's
*NL*
impression
,
but
she
never
forgot
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
wrote
to
her
husband
asking
him
about
a
divorce
,
and
towards
the
*NL*
end
of
November
,
taking
leave
of
Princess
Varvara
,
who
wanted
to
go
to
*NL*
Petersburg
,
she
went
with
Vronsky
to
Moscow
.
Expecting
every
day
an
*NL*
answer
from
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
after
that
the
divorce
,
they
now
*NL*
established
themselves
together
like
married
people

PART
SEVEN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Levins
had
been
three
months
in
Moscow
.
The
date
had
long
passed
on
*NL*
which
,
according
to
the
most
trustworthy
calculations
of
people
learned
*NL*
in
such
matters
,
Kitty
should
have
been
confined
.
But
she
was
still
*NL*
about
,
and
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
her
time
was
any
nearer
than
*NL*
two
months
ago
.
The
doctor
,
the
monthly
nurse
,
and
Dolly
and
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
most
of
all
Levin
,
who
could
not
think
of
the
approaching
event
*NL*
without
terror
,
began
to
be
impatient
and
uneasy
.
Kitty
was
the
only
*NL*
person
who
felt
perfectly
calm
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
distinctly
conscious
now
of
the
birth
of
a
new
feeling
of
love
*NL*
for
the
future
child
,
for
her
to
some
extent
actually
existing
already
,
*NL*
and
she
brooded
blissfully
over
this
feeling
.
He
was
not
by
now
*NL*
altogether
a
part
of
herself
,
but
sometimes
lived
his
own
life
*NL*
independently
of
her
.
Often
this
separate
being
gave
her
pain
,
but
at
*NL*
the
same
time
she
wanted
to
laugh
with
a
strange
new
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
people
she
loved
were
with
her
,
and
all
were
so
good
to
her
,
so
*NL*
attentively
caring
for
her
,
so
entirely
pleasant
was
everything
*NL*
presented
to
her
,
that
if
she
had
not
known
and
felt
that
it
must
all
*NL*
soon
be
over
,
she
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
and
pleasanter
*NL*
life
.
The
only
thing
that
spoiled
the
charm
of
this
manner
of
life
was
*NL*
that
her
husband
was
not
here
as
she
loved
him
to
be
,
and
as
he
was
in
*NL*
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
liked
his
serene
,
friendly
,
and
hospitable
manner
in
the
country
.
In
*NL*
the
town
he
seemed
continually
uneasy
and
on
his
guard
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
afraid
someone
would
be
rude
to
him
,
and
still
more
to
her
.
At
home
*NL*
in
the
country
,
knowing
himself
distinctly
to
be
in
his
right
place
,
he
*NL*
was
never
in
haste
to
be
off
elsewhere
.
He
was
never
unoccupied
.
Here
in
*NL*
town
he
was
in
a
continual
hurry
,
as
though
afraid
of
missing
something
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
had
nothing
to
do
.
And
she
felt
sorry
for
him
.
To
others
,
she
*NL*
knew
,
he
did
not
appear
an
object
of
pity
.
On
the
contrary
,
when
Kitty
*NL*
looked
at
him
in
society
,
as
one
sometimes
looks
at
those
one
loves
,
*NL*
trying
to
see
him
as
if
he
were
a
stranger
,
so
as
to
catch
the
*NL*
impression
he
must
make
on
others
,
she
saw
with
a
panic
even
of
jealous
*NL*
fear
that
he
was
far
indeed
from
being
a
pitiable
figure
,
that
he
was
*NL*
very
attractive
with
his
fine
breeding
,
his
rather
old-fashioned
,
*NL*
reserved
courtesy
with
women
,
his
powerful
figure
,
and
striking
,
as
she
*NL*
thought
,
and
expressive
face
.
But
she
saw
him
not
from
without
,
but
from
*NL*
within
;
she
saw
that
here
he
was
not
himself
;
that
was
the
only
way
she
*NL*
could
define
his
condition
to
herself
.
Sometimes
she
inwardly
reproached
*NL*
him
for
his
inability
to
live
in
the
town
;
sometimes
she
recognized
that
*NL*
it
was
really
hard
for
him
to
order
his
life
here
so
that
he
could
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
he
to
do
,
indeed
?
He
did
not
care
for
cards
;
he
did
not
go
to
a
*NL*
club
.
Spending
the
time
with
jovial
gentlemen
of
Oblonsky
's
type
--
she
*NL*
knew
now
what
that
meant
...
it
meant
drinking
and
going
somewhere
after
*NL*
drinking
.
She
could
not
think
without
horror
of
where
men
went
on
such
*NL*
occasions
.
Was
he
to
go
into
society
?
But
she
knew
he
could
only
find
*NL*
satisfaction
in
that
if
he
took
pleasure
in
the
society
of
young
women
,
*NL*
and
that
she
could
not
wish
for
.
Should
he
stay
at
home
with
her
,
her
*NL*
mother
and
her
sisters
?
But
much
as
she
liked
and
enjoyed
their
*NL*
conversations
forever
on
the
same
subjects
--
``
Aline-Nadine
,
''
as
the
old
*NL*
prince
called
the
sisters
'
talks
--
she
knew
it
must
bore
him
.
What
was
*NL*
there
left
for
him
to
do
?
To
go
on
writing
at
his
book
he
had
indeed
*NL*
attempted
,
and
at
first
he
used
to
go
to
the
library
and
make
extracts
*NL*
and
look
up
references
for
his
book
.
But
,
as
he
told
her
,
the
more
he
*NL*
did
nothing
,
the
less
time
he
had
to
do
anything
.
And
besides
,
he
*NL*
complained
that
he
had
talked
too
much
about
his
book
here
,
and
that
*NL*
consequently
all
his
ideas
about
it
were
muddled
and
had
lost
their
*NL*
interest
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
advantage
in
this
town
life
was
that
quarrels
hardly
ever
happened
*NL*
between
them
here
in
town
.
Whether
it
was
that
their
conditions
were
*NL*
different
,
or
that
they
had
both
become
more
careful
and
sensible
in
*NL*
that
respect
,
they
had
no
quarrels
in
Moscow
from
jealousy
,
which
they
*NL*
had
so
dreaded
when
they
moved
from
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
event
,
an
event
of
great
importance
to
both
from
that
point
of
view
,
*NL*
did
indeed
happen
--
that
was
Kitty
's
meeting
with
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
Princess
Marya
Borissovna
,
Kitty
's
godmother
,
who
had
always
*NL*
been
very
fond
of
her
,
had
insisted
on
seeing
her
.
Kitty
,
though
she
did
*NL*
not
go
into
society
at
all
on
account
of
her
condition
,
went
with
her
*NL*
father
to
see
the
venerable
old
lady
,
and
there
met
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
thing
Kitty
could
reproach
herself
for
at
this
meeting
was
that
*NL*
at
the
instant
when
she
recognized
in
his
civilian
dress
the
features
*NL*
once
so
familiar
to
her
,
her
breath
failed
her
,
the
blood
rushed
to
her
*NL*
heart
,
and
a
vivid
blush
--
she
felt
it
--
overspread
her
face
.
But
this
*NL*
lasted
only
a
few
seconds
.
Before
her
father
,
who
purposely
began
*NL*
talking
in
a
loud
voice
to
Vronsky
,
had
finished
,
she
was
perfectly
*NL*
ready
to
look
at
Vronsky
,
to
speak
to
him
,
if
necessary
,
exactly
as
she
*NL*
spoke
to
Princess
Marya
Borissovna
,
and
more
than
that
,
to
do
so
in
such
*NL*
a
way
that
everything
to
the
faintest
intonation
and
smile
would
have
*NL*
been
approved
by
her
husband
,
whose
unseen
presence
she
seemed
to
feel
*NL*
about
her
at
that
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
a
few
words
to
him
,
even
smiled
serenely
at
his
joke
about
the
*NL*
elections
,
which
he
called
``
our
parliament
.
''
-LRB-
She
had
to
smile
to
show
*NL*
she
saw
the
joke
.
-RRB-
But
she
turned
away
immediately
to
Princess
Marya
*NL*
Borissovna
,
and
did
not
once
glance
at
him
till
he
got
up
to
go
;
then
*NL*
she
looked
at
him
,
but
evidently
only
because
it
would
be
uncivil
not
to
*NL*
look
at
a
man
when
he
is
saying
good-bye
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
grateful
to
her
father
for
saying
nothing
to
her
about
their
*NL*
meeting
Vronsky
,
but
she
saw
by
his
special
warmth
to
her
after
the
*NL*
visit
during
their
usual
walk
that
he
was
pleased
with
her
.
She
was
*NL*
pleased
with
herself
.
She
had
not
expected
she
would
have
had
the
power
,
*NL*
while
keeping
somewhere
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
all
the
memories
of
*NL*
her
old
feeling
for
Vronsky
,
not
only
to
seem
but
to
be
perfectly
*NL*
indifferent
and
composed
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
flushed
a
great
deal
more
than
she
when
she
told
him
she
had
met
*NL*
Vronsky
at
Princess
Marya
Borissovna
's
.
It
was
very
hard
for
her
to
tell
*NL*
him
this
,
but
still
harder
to
go
on
speaking
of
the
details
of
the
*NL*
meeting
,
as
he
did
not
question
her
,
but
simply
gazed
at
her
with
a
*NL*
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
you
were
n't
there
,
''
she
said
.
``
Not
that
you
were
n't
in
*NL*
the
room
...
I
could
n't
have
been
so
natural
in
your
presence
...
I
am
*NL*
blushing
now
much
more
,
much
,
much
more
,
''
she
said
,
blushing
till
the
*NL*
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
``
But
that
you
could
n't
see
through
a
crack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truthful
eyes
told
Levin
that
she
was
satisfied
with
herself
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
blushing
he
was
quickly
reassured
and
began
questioning
*NL*
her
,
which
was
all
she
wanted
.
When
he
had
heard
everything
,
even
to
the
*NL*
detail
that
for
the
first
second
she
could
not
help
flushing
,
but
that
*NL*
afterwards
she
was
just
as
direct
and
as
much
at
her
ease
as
with
any
*NL*
chance
acquaintance
,
Levin
was
quite
happy
again
and
said
he
was
glad
of
*NL*
it
,
and
would
not
now
behave
as
stupidly
as
he
had
done
at
the
election
,
*NL*
but
would
try
the
first
time
he
met
Vronsky
to
be
as
friendly
as
*NL*
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
wretched
to
feel
that
there
's
a
man
almost
an
enemy
whom
it
's
*NL*
painful
to
meet
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
.

``

Kitty
said
to
her
husband
,
*NL*
when
he
came
in
to
see
her
at
eleven
o'clock
before
going
out
.
``
I
know
*NL*

are

*NL*
*NL*
``

am

answered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
so
early

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
promised
to
introduce
me

talk

said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
his
article

were
praising
so
?
Well

and
after
that

*NL*
said
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
to
the
court
,
perhaps
,
about
my
sister
's
business

And

she
queried

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

he
said

looking
at
his

watch

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
absolutely
!
He
has
been
to
see
us
.
Come
,
what
is
it
?
You
go
in
,
sit
*NL*
down
,
talk
for
five
minutes
of
the
weather
,
get
up
and
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
would
n't
believe
it
!
I
've
got
so
out
of
the
way
of
all
this
*NL*
that
it
makes
me
feel
positively
ashamed
.
It
's
such
a
horrible
thing
to
*NL*
do
!
A
complete
outsider
walks
in
,
sits
down
,
stays
on
with
nothing
to
*NL*
do
,
wastes
their
time
and
worries
himself
,
and
walks
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
suppose
you
used
to
pay
calls
before
you
were
married
,
did
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
but
I
always
felt
ashamed
,
and
now
I
'm
so
out
of
the
way
of
*NL*
it
that
,
by
Jove
!
I
'd
sooner
go
two
days
running
without
my
dinner
than
*NL*
pay
this
call
!
One
's
so
ashamed
!
I
feel
all
the
while
that
they
're
*NL*
annoyed
,
that
they
're
saying
,
`
What
has
he
come
for
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
wo
n't
.
I
'll
answer
for
that
,
''
said
Kitty
,
looking
into
his
*NL*
face
with
a
laugh
.
She
took
his
hand
.
``
Well
,
good-bye
...
Do
go
,
*NL*
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
just
going
out
after
kissing
his
wife
's
hand
,
when
she
stopped
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
,
do
you
know
I
've
only
fifty
roubles
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
I
'll
go
to
the
bank
and
get
some
.
How
much
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
with
the
expression
of
dissatisfaction
she
knew
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
wait
a
minute
.
''
She
held
his
hand
.
``
Let
's
talk
about
it
,
it
worries
*NL*
me
.
I
seem
to
spend
nothing
unnecessary
,
but
money
seems
to
fly
away
*NL*
simply
.
We
do
n't
manage
well
,
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
all
right
,
''
he
said
with
a
little
cough
,
looking
at
her
from
*NL*
under
his
brows
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
cough
she
knew
well
.
It
was
a
sign
of
intense
dissatisfaction
,
not
*NL*
with
her
,
but
with
himself
.
He
certainly
was
displeased
not
at
so
much
*NL*
money
being
spent
,
but
at
being
reminded
of
what
he
,
knowing
something
*NL*
was
unsatisfactory
,
wanted
to
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
Sokolov
to
sell
the
wheat
,
and
to
borrow
an
advance
on
the
*NL*
mill
.
We
shall
have
money
enough
in
any
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
'm
afraid
that
altogether
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
all
right
,
all
right
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
Well
,
good-bye
,
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
really
sorry
sometimes
that
I
listened
to
mamma
.
How
nice
it
*NL*
would
have
been
in
the
country
!
As
it
is
,
I
'm
worrying
you
all
,
and
*NL*
we
're
wasting
our
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
not
at
all

Not
once
since
I
've
been
married

I
said
*NL*
that
things
could
have
been
better
than
they
are
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
?
''
she
said
,
looking
into
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
said
it
without
thinking
,
simply
to
console
her
.
But
when
he
*NL*
glanced
at
her
and
saw
those
sweet
truthful
eyes
fastened
questioningly
*NL*
on
him
,
he
repeated
it
with
his
whole
heart
.
``
I
was
positively
*NL*
forgetting
her
,
''
he
thought
.
And
he
remembered
what
was
before
them
,
so
*NL*
soon
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
it
be
soon
?
How
do
you
feel
?
''
he
whispered
,
taking
her
two
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
so
often
thought
so
,
that
now
I
do
n't
think
about
it

anything
about
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
're
not
frightened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
contemptuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
little
bit
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

if
anything
happens

I
shall
be
at
Katavasov

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

nothing

She
's
in

talking

with

was
her

Lvov

determined
to

*NL*
*NL*
``

Levin

*NL*
*NL*

be
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

if
I
do
go

I
'll
go
with
Natalia

Well

*NL*
good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
steps
Levin
was
stopped
by
his
old
servant
Kouzma
,
who
had
been
*NL*
with
him
before
his
marriage
,
and
now
looked
after
their
household
in
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beauty
''
-LRB-
that
was
the
left
shaft-horse
brought
up
from
the
country
-RRB-
*NL*
``
has
been
badly
shod
and
is
quite
lame
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
does
your
honor
*NL*
wish
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
part
of
their
stay
in
Moscow
,
Levin
had
used
his
own
*NL*
horses
brought
up
from
the
country
.
He
had
tried
to
arrange
this
part
of
*NL*
their
expenses
in
the
best
and
cheapest
way
possible
;
but
it
appeared
*NL*
that
their
own
horses
came
dearer
than
hired
horses
,
and
they
still
*NL*
hired
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
for
the
veterinary
,
there
may
be
a
bruise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
Katerina
Alexandrovna
?
''
asked
Kouzma
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
was
not
by
now
struck
as
he
had
been
at
first
by
the
fact
that
to
*NL*
get
from
one
end
of
Moscow
to
the
other
he
had
to
have
two
powerful
*NL*
horses
put
into
a
heavy
carriage
,
to
take
the
carriage
three
miles
*NL*
through
the
snowy
slush
and
to
keep
it
standing
there
four
hours
,
paying
*NL*
five
roubles
every
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
seemed
quite
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hire
a
pair
for
our
carriage
from
the
jobmaster
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
simply
and
easily
,
thanks
to
the
facilities
of
town
life
,
Levin
*NL*
settled
a
question
which
,
in
the
country
,
would
have
called
for
so
much
*NL*
personal
trouble
and
exertion
,
and
going
out
onto
the
steps
,
he
called
a
*NL*
sledge
,
sat
down
,
and
drove
to
Nikitsky
.
On
the
way
he
thought
no
more
*NL*
of
money
,
but
mused
on
the
introduction
that
awaited
him
to
the
*NL*
Petersburg
savant
,
a
writer
on
sociology
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
him
*NL*
about
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
during
the
first
days
of
his
stay
in
Moscow
Levin
had
been
struck
*NL*
by
the
expenditure
,
strange
to
one
living
in
the
country
,
unproductive
*NL*
but
inevitable
,
that
was
expected
of
him
on
every
side
.
But
by
now
he
*NL*
had
grown
used
to
it
.
That
had
happened
to
him
in
this
matter
which
is
*NL*
said
to
happen
to
drunkards
--
the
first
glass
sticks
in
the
throat
,
the
*NL*
second
flies
down
like
a
hawk
,
but
after
the
third
they
're
like
tiny
*NL*
little
birds
.
When
Levin
had
changed
his
first
hundred-rouble
note
to
*NL*
pay
for
liveries
for
his
footmen
and
hall-porter
he
could
not
help
*NL*
reflecting
that
these
liveries
were
of
no
use
to
anyone
--
but
they
were
*NL*
indubitably
necessary
,
to
judge
by
the
amazement
of
the
princess
and
*NL*
Kitty
when
he
suggested
that
they
might
do
without
liveries
,
--
that
these
*NL*
liveries
would
cost
the
wages
of
two
laborers
for
the
summer
,
that
is
,
*NL*
would
pay
for
about
three
hundred
working
days
from
Easter
to
Ash
*NL*
Wednesday
,
and
each
a
day
of
hard
work
from
early
morning
to
late
*NL*
evening
--
and
that
hundred-rouble
note
did
stick
in
his
throat
.
But
the
*NL*
next
note
,
changed
to
pay
for
providing
a
dinner
for
their
relations
,
*NL*
that
cost
twenty-eight
roubles
,
though
it
did
excite
in
Levin
the
*NL*
reflection
that
twenty-eight
roubles
meant
nine
measures
of
oats
,
which
*NL*
men
would
with
groans
and
sweat
have
reaped
and
bound
and
thrashed
and
*NL*
winnowed
and
sifted
and
sown
,
--
this
next
one
he
parted
with
more
easily
.
*NL*
And
now
the
notes
he
changed
no
longer
aroused
such
reflections
,
and
*NL*
they
flew
off
like
little
birds
.
Whether
the
labor
devoted
to
obtaining
*NL*
the
money
corresponded
to
the
pleasure
given
by
what
was
bought
with
it
,
*NL*
was
a
consideration
he
had
long
ago
dismissed
.
His
business
calculation
*NL*
that
there
was
a
certain
price
below
which
he
could
not
sell
certain
*NL*
grain
was
forgotten
too
.
The
rye
,
for
the
price
of
which
he
had
so
long
*NL*
held
out
,
had
been
sold
for
fifty
kopecks
a
measure
cheaper
than
it
had
*NL*
been
fetching
a
month
ago
.
Even
the
consideration
that
with
such
an
*NL*
expenditure
he
could
not
go
on
living
for
a
year
without
debt
,
that
even
*NL*
had
no
force
.
Only
one
thing
was
essential
:
to
have
money
in
the
bank
,
*NL*
without
inquiring
where
it
came
from
,
so
as
to
know
that
one
had
the
*NL*
wherewithal
to
buy
meat
for
tomorrow
.
And
this
condition
had
hitherto
*NL*
been
fulfilled
;
he
had
always
had
the
money
in
the
bank
.
But
now
the
*NL*
money
in
the
bank
had
gone
,
and
he
could
not
quite
tell
where
to
get
the
*NL*
next
installment
.
And
this
it
was
which
,
at
the
moment
when
Kitty
had
*NL*
mentioned
money
,
had
disturbed
him
;
but
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
*NL*
it
.
He
drove
off
,
thinking
of
Katavasov
and
the
meeting
with
Metrov
that
*NL*
was
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
on
this
visit
to
town
seen
a
great
deal
of
his
old
friend
at
*NL*
the
university
,
Professor
Katavasov
,
whom
he
had
not
seen
since
his
*NL*
marriage
.
He
liked
in
Katavasov
the
clearness
and
simplicity
of
his
*NL*
conception
of
life
.
Levin
thought
that
the
clearness
of
Katavasov
's
*NL*
conception
of
life
was
due
to
the
poverty
of
his
nature
;
Katavasov
*NL*
thought
that
the
disconnectedness
of
Levin
's
ideas
was
due
to
his
lack
*NL*
of
intellectual
discipline
;
but
Levin
enjoyed
Katavasov
's
clearness
,
and
*NL*
Katavasov
enjoyed
the
abundance
of
Levin
's
untrained
ideas
,
and
they
*NL*
liked
to
meet
and
to
discuss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
had
read
Katavasov
some
parts
of
his
book
,
and
he
had
liked
them
.
*NL*
On
the
previous
day
Katavasov
had
met
Levin
at
a
public
lecture
and
told
*NL*
him
that
the
celebrated
Metrov
,
whose
article
Levin
had
so
much
liked
,
*NL*
was
in
Moscow
,
that
he
had
been
much
interested
by
what
Katavasov
had
*NL*
told
him
about
Levin
's
work
,
and
that
he
was
coming
to
see
him
tomorrow
*NL*
at
eleven
,
and
would
be
very
glad
to
make
Levin
's
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
positively
a
reformed
character
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
,
''
said
*NL*
Katavasov
,
meeting
Levin
in
the
little
drawing
room
.
``
I
heard
the
bell
*NL*
and
thought
:
Impossible
that
it
can
be
he
at
the
exact
time
!
...
Well
,
*NL*
what
do
you
say
to
the
Montenegrins
now
?
They
're
a
race
of
warriors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
happened
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katavasov
in
a
few
words
told
him
the
last
piece
of
news
from
the
war
,
*NL*
and
going
into
his
study
,
introduced
Levin
to
a
short
,
thick-set
man
of
*NL*
pleasant
appearance
.
This
was
Metrov
.
The
conversation
touched
for
a
*NL*
brief
space
on
politics
and
on
how
recent
events
were
looked
at
in
the
*NL*
higher
spheres
in
Petersburg
.
Metrov
repeated
a
saying
that
had
reached
*NL*
him
through
a
most
trustworthy
source
,
reported
as
having
been
uttered
*NL*
on
this
subject
by
the
Tsar
and
one
of
the
ministers
.
Katavasov
had
*NL*
heard
also
on
excellent
authority
that
the
Tsar
had
said
something
quite
*NL*
different
.
Levin
tried
to
imagine
circumstances
in
which
both
sayings
*NL*
might
have
been
uttered
,
and
the
conversation
on
that
topic
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
here
he
's
written
almost
a
book
on
the
natural
conditions
of
the
*NL*
laborer
in
relation
to
the
land
,
''
said
Katavasov
;
``
I
'm
not
a
specialist
,
*NL*
but
I
,
as
a
natural
science
man
,
was
pleased
at
his
not
taking
mankind
*NL*
as
something
outside
biological
laws
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
seeing
his
*NL*
dependence
on
his
surroundings
,
and
in
that
dependence
seeking
the
laws
*NL*
of
his
development
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
interesting
,
''
said
Metrov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
began
precisely
was
to
write
a
book
on
agriculture
;
but
studying
*NL*
the
chief
instrument
of
agriculture
,
the
laborer
,
''
said
Levin
,
*NL*
reddening
,
``
I
could
not
help
coming
to
quite
unexpected
results
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
began
carefully
,
as
it
were
,
feeling
his
ground
,
to
expound
*NL*
his
views
.
He
knew
Metrov
had
written
an
article
against
the
generally
*NL*
accepted
theory
of
political
economy
,
but
to
what
extent
he
could
reckon
*NL*
on
his
sympathy
with
his
own
new
views
he
did
not
know
and
could
not
*NL*
guess
from
the
clever
and
serene
face
of
the
learned
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
in
what
do
you
see
the
special
characteristics
of
the
Russian
*NL*
laborer
?
''
said
Metrov
;
``
in
his
biological
characteristics
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
or
in
the
condition
in
which
he
is
placed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
saw
that
there
was
an
idea
underlying
this
question
with
which
he
*NL*
did
not
agree
.
But
he
went
on
explaining
his
own
idea
that
the
Russian
*NL*
laborer
has
a
quite
special
view
of
the
land
,
different
from
that
of
*NL*
other
people
;
and
to
support
this
proposition
he
made
haste
to
add
that
*NL*
in
his
opinion
this
attitude
of
the
Russian
peasant
was
due
to
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
vocation
to
people
vast
unoccupied
expanses
in
the
*NL*
East
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
may
easily
be
led
into
error
in
basing
any
conclusion
on
the
*NL*
general
vocation
of
a
people
,
''
said
Metrov
,
interrupting
Levin
.
``
The
*NL*
condition
of
the
laborer
will
always
depend
on
his
relation
to
the
land
*NL*
and
to
capital
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
letting
Levin
finish
explaining
his
idea
,
Metrov
began
*NL*
expounding
to
him
the
special
point
of
his
own
theory
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
the
point
of
his
theory
lay
,
Levin
did
not
understand
,
because
*NL*
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
understand
.
He
saw
that
Metrov
,
like
*NL*
other
people
,
in
spite
of
his
own
article
,
in
which
he
had
attacked
the
*NL*
current
theory
of
political
economy
,
looked
at
the
position
of
the
*NL*
Russian
peasant
simply
from
the
point
of
view
of
capital
,
wages
,
and
*NL*
rent
.
He
would
indeed
have
been
obliged
to
admit
that
in
the
*NL*
eastern
--
much
the
larger
--
part
of
Russia
rent
was
as
yet
nil
,
that
for
*NL*
nine-tenths
of
the
eighty
millions
of
the
Russian
peasants
wages
took
*NL*
the
form
simply
of
food
provided
for
themselves
,
and
that
capital
does
*NL*
not
so
far
exist
except
in
the
form
of
the
most
primitive
tools
.
Yet
it
*NL*
was
only
from
that
point
of
view
that
he
considered
every
laborer
,
*NL*
though
in
many
points
he
differed
from
the
economists
and
had
his
own
*NL*
theory
of
the
wage-fund
,
which
he
expounded
to
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
listened
reluctantly
,
and
at
first
made
objections
.
He
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
interrupt
Metrov
,
to
explain
his
own
thought
,
which
in
his
*NL*
opinion
would
have
rendered
further
exposition
of
Metrov
's
theories
*NL*
superfluous
.
But
later
on
,
feeling
convinced
that
they
looked
at
the
*NL*
matter
so
differently
,
that
they
could
never
understand
one
another
,
he
*NL*
did
not
even
oppose
his
statements
,
but
simply
listened
.
Although
what
*NL*
Metrov
was
saying
was
by
now
utterly
devoid
of
interest
for
him
,
he
yet
*NL*
experienced
a
certain
satisfaction
in
listening
to
him
.
It
flattered
his
*NL*
vanity
that
such
a
learned
man
should
explain
his
ideas
to
him
so
*NL*
eagerly
,
with
such
intensity
and
confidence
in
Levin
's
understanding
of
*NL*
the
subject
,
sometimes
with
a
mere
hint
referring
him
to
a
whole
aspect
*NL*
of
the
subject
.
He
put
this
down
to
his
own
credit
,
unaware
that
Metrov
,
*NL*
who
had
already
discussed
his
theory
over
and
over
again
with
all
his
*NL*
intimate
friends
,
talked
of
it
with
special
eagerness
to
every
new
*NL*
person
,
and
in
general
was
eager
to
talk
to
anyone
of
any
subject
that
*NL*
interested
him
,
even
if
still
obscure
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
late
though
,
''
said
Katavasov
,
looking
at
his
watch
directly
*NL*
Metrov
had
finished
his
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
a
meeting
of
the
Society
of
Amateurs
today
in
*NL*
commemoration
of
the
jubilee
of
Svintitch
,
''
said
Katavasov
in
answer
to
*NL*
Levin
's
inquiry
.
``
Pyotr
Ivanovitch
and
I
were
going
.
I
've
promised
to
*NL*
deliver
an
address
on
his
labors
in
zoology
.
Come
along
with
us
,
it
's
*NL*
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
indeed
it
's
time
to
start
,
''
said
Metrov
.
``
Come
with
us
,
and
*NL*
from
there
,
if
you
care
to
,
come
to
my
place
.
I
should
very
much
like
to
*NL*
hear
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
It
's
no
good
yet
,
it
's
unfinished
.
But
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
*NL*
go
to
the
meeting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
friends
,
have
you
heard
?
He
has
handed
in
the
separate
report
,
''
*NL*
Katavasov
called
from
the
other
room
,
where
he
was
putting
on
his
frock
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
conversation
sprang
up
upon
the
university
question
,
which
was
a
*NL*
very
important
event
that
winter
in
Moscow
.
Three
old
professors
in
the
*NL*
council
had
not
accepted
the
opinion
of
the
younger
professors
.
The
*NL*
young
ones
had
registered
a
separate
resolution
.
This
,
in
the
judgment
*NL*
of
some
people
,
was
monstrous
,
in
the
judgment
of
others
it
was
the
*NL*
simplest
and
most
just
thing
to
do
,
and
the
professors
were
split
up
*NL*
into
two
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
party
,
to
which
Katavasov
belonged
,
saw
in
the
opposite
party
a
*NL*
scoundrelly
betrayal
and
treachery
,
while
the
opposite
party
saw
in
them
*NL*
childishness
and
lack
of
respect
for
the
authorities
.
Levin
,
though
he
*NL*
did
not
belong
to
the
university
,
had
several
times
already
during
his
*NL*
stay
in
Moscow
heard
and
talked
about
this
matter
,
and
had
his
own
*NL*
opinion
on
the
subject
.
He
took
part
in
the
conversation
that
was
*NL*
continued
in
the
street
,
as
they
all
three
walked
to
the
buildings
of
*NL*
the
old
university
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
had
already
begun
.
Round
the
cloth-covered
table
,
at
which
*NL*
Katavasov
and
Metrov
seated
themselves
,
there
were
some
half-dozen
*NL*
persons
,
and
one
of
these
was
bending
close
over
a
manuscript
,
reading
*NL*
something
aloud
.
Levin
sat
down
in
one
of
the
empty
chairs
that
were
*NL*
standing
round
the
table
,
and
in
a
whisper
asked
a
student
sitting
near
*NL*
what
was
being
read
.
The
student
,
eyeing
Levin
with
displeasure
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biography
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Levin
was
not
interested
in
the
biography
,
he
could
not
help
*NL*
listening
,
and
learned
some
new
and
interesting
facts
about
the
life
of
*NL*
the
distinguished
man
of
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
reader
had
finished
,
the
chairman
thanked
him
and
read
some
*NL*
verses
of
the
poet
Ment
sent
him
on
the
jubilee
,
and
said
a
few
words
by
*NL*
way
of
thanks
to
the
poet
.
Then
Katavasov
in
his
loud
,
ringing
voice
*NL*
read
his
address
on
the
scientific
labors
of
the
man
whose
jubilee
was
*NL*
being
kept
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Katavasov
had
finished
,
Levin
looked
at
his
watch
,
saw
it
was
past
*NL*
one
,
and
thought
that
there
would
not
be
time
before
the
concert
to
read
*NL*
Metrov
his
book
,
and
indeed
,
he
did
not
now
care
to
do
so
.
During
the
*NL*
reading
he
had
thought
over
their
conversation
.
He
saw
distinctly
now
*NL*
that
though
Metrov
's
ideas
might
perhaps
have
value
,
his
own
ideas
had
a
*NL*
value
too
,
and
their
ideas
could
only
be
made
clear
and
lead
to
*NL*
something
if
each
worked
separately
in
his
chosen
path
,
and
that
nothing
*NL*
would
be
gained
by
putting
their
ideas
together
.
And
having
made
up
his
*NL*
mind
to
refuse
Metrov
's
invitation
,
Levin
went
up
to
him
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
meeting
.
Metrov
introduced
Levin
to
the
chairman
,
with
whom
he
was
*NL*
talking
of
the
political
news
.
Metrov
told
the
chairman
what
he
had
*NL*
already
told
Levin
,
and
Levin
made
the
same
remarks
on
his
news
that
he
*NL*
had
already
made
that
morning
,
but
for
the
sake
of
variety
he
expressed
*NL*
also
a
new
opinion
which
had
only
just
struck
him
.
After
that
the
*NL*
conversation
turned
again
on
the
university
question
.
As
Levin
had
*NL*
already
heard
it
all
,
he
made
haste
to
tell
Metrov
that
he
was
sorry
he
*NL*
could
not
take
advantage
of
his
invitation
,
took
leave
,
and
drove
to
*NL*
Lvov
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lvov
,
the
husband
of
Natalia
,
Kitty
's
sister
,
had
spent
all
his
life
in
*NL*
foreign
capitals
,
where
he
had
been
educated
,
and
had
been
in
the
*NL*
diplomatic
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
previous
year
he
had
left
the
diplomatic
service
,
not
owing
*NL*
to
any
``
unpleasantness
''
-LRB-
he
never
had
any
``
unpleasantness
''
with
anyone
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
was
transferred
to
the
department
of
the
court
of
the
palace
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
in
order
to
give
his
two
boys
the
best
education
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
striking
contrast
in
their
habits
and
views
and
the
fact
*NL*
that
Lvov
was
older
than
Levin
,
they
had
seen
a
great
deal
of
one
*NL*
another
that
winter
,
and
had
taken
a
great
liking
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lvov
was
at
home
,
and
Levin
went
in
to
him
unannounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lvov
,
in
a
house
coat
with
a
belt
and
in
chamois
leather
shoes
,
was
*NL*
sitting
in
an
armchair
,
and
with
a
pince-nez
with
blue
glasses
he
was
*NL*
reading
a
book
that
stood
on
a
reading
desk
,
while
in
his
beautiful
hand
*NL*
he
held
a
half-burned
cigarette
daintily
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
handsome
,
delicate
,
and
still
youthful-looking
face
,
to
which
his
*NL*
curly
,
glistening
silvery
hair
gave
a
still
more
aristocratic
air
,
*NL*
lighted
up
with
a
smile
when
he
saw
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
!
I
was
meaning
to
send
to
you
.
How
's
Kitty
?
Sit
here
,
it
's
more
*NL*
comfortable
.
''
He
got
up
and
pushed
up
a
rocking
chair
.
``
Have
you
read
*NL*
the
last
circular
in
the
_
Journal
de
St.
Petersbourg
?
_
I
think
it
's
*NL*
excellent
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
slight
French
accent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
told
him
what
he
had
heard
from
Katavasov
was
being
said
in
*NL*
Petersburg
,
and
after
talking
a
little
about
politics
,
he
told
him
of
*NL*
his
interview
with
Metrov
,
and
the
learned
society
's
meeting
.
To
Lvov
it
*NL*
was
very
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
envy
you
,
that
you
are
able
to
mix
in
these
interesting
*NL*
scientific
circles
,
''
he
said
.
And
as
he
talked
,
he
passed
as
usual
into
*NL*
French
,
which
was
easier
to
him
.
``
It
's
true
I
have
n't
the
time
for
it
.
*NL*
My
official
work
and
the
children
leave
me
no
time
;
and
then
I
'm
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
own
that
my
education
has
been
too
defective
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
do
n't
believe
,
''
said
Levin
with
a
smile
,
feeling
,
as
he
always
*NL*
did
,
touched
at
Lvov
's
low
opinion
of
himself
,
which
was
not
in
the
*NL*
least
put
on
from
a
desire
to
seem
or
to
be
modest
,
but
was
absolutely
*NL*
sincere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
indeed
!
I
feel
now
how
badly
educated
I
am
.
To
educate
my
*NL*
children
I
positively
have
to
look
up
a
great
deal
,
and
in
fact
simply
*NL*
to
study
myself
.
For
it
's
not
enough
to
have
teachers
,
there
must
be
*NL*
someone
to
look
after
them
,
just
as
on
your
land
you
want
laborers
and
*NL*
an
overseer
.
See
what
I
'm
reading
''
--
he
pointed
to
Buslaev
's
_
Grammar
_
on
*NL*
the
desk
--
``
it
's
expected
of
Misha
,
and
it
's
so
difficult
...
Come
,
*NL*
explain
to
me
...
Here
he
says
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
tried
to
explain
to
him
that
it
could
n't
be
understood
,
but
that
*NL*
it
had
to
be
taught
;
but
Lvov
would
not
agree
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
laughing
at
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
you
ca
n't
imagine
how
,
when
I
look
at
you

'm
always

learning
the
task
that
lies
before
me

the
education

children

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
nothing
for
you
to
learn

''
said
Lvov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
know
,
''
said
Levin
,
``
is
that
I
have
never
seen
better
brought-up
*NL*
children
than
yours

and
I
would
n't
wish
for
children
better

yours

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lvov
visibly
tried
to
restrain
the
expression
of
his
delight
,
but
he
was
*NL*
positively
radiant
with
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

they
're
better
than
I

he
said
,

mine

run

wild
abroad

*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
catch
all

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk

*NL*
crop
up
,
and
the
struggle
begins
again
.
If
one
had
not
a
support
in
*NL*
religion
--
you
remember
we
talked
about
that
--
no
father
could
bring
*NL*
children
up
relying
on
his
own
strength
alone
without
that
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
subject
,
which
always
interested
Levin
,
was
cut
short
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
beauty
Natalia
Alexandrovna
,
dressed
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
here
,
''
she
said
,
unmistakably
feeling
no
regret
,
*NL*
but
a
positive
pleasure
,
in
interrupting
this
conversation
on
a
topic
*NL*
she
had
heard
so
much
of
that
she
was
by
now
weary
of
it
.
``
Well
,
how
is
*NL*
Kitty
?
I
am
dining
with
you
today
.
I
tell
you
what
,
Arseny
,
''
she
turned
*NL*
to
her
husband
,
``
you
take
the
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
husband
and
wife
began
to
discuss
their
arrangements
for
the
*NL*
day
.
As
the
husband
had
to
drive
to
meet
someone
on
official
business
,
*NL*
while
the
wife
had
to
go
to
the
concert
and
some
public
meeting
of
a
*NL*
committee
on
the
Eastern
Question
,
there
was
a
great
deal
to
consider
*NL*
and
settle
.
Levin
had
to
take
part
in
their
plans
as
one
of
themselves
.
*NL*
It
was
settled
that
Levin
should
go
with
Natalia
to
the
concert
and
the
*NL*
meeting
,
and
that
from
there
they
should
send
the
carriage
to
the
office
*NL*
for
Arseny
,
and
he
should
call
for
her
and
take
her
to
Kitty
's
;
or
that
,
*NL*
if
he
had
not
finished
his
work
,
he
should
send
the
carriage
back
and
*NL*
Levin
would
go
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
spoiling
me
,
''
Lvov
said
to
his
wife
;
``
he
assures
me
that
our
*NL*
children
are
splendid
,
when
I
know
how
much
that
's
bad
there
is
in
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Arseny
goes
to
extremes
,
I
always
say
,
''
said
his
wife
.
``
If
you
look
for
*NL*
perfection
,
you
will
never
be
satisfied
.
And
it
's
true
,
as
papa
*NL*
says
,
--
that
when
we
were
brought
up
there
was
one
extreme
--
we
were
kept
*NL*
in
the
basement
,
while
our
parents
lived
in
the
best
rooms
;
now
it
's
*NL*
just
the
other
way
--
the
parents
are
in
the
wash
house
,
while
the
*NL*
children
are
in
the
best
rooms
.
Parents
now
are
not
expected
to
live
at
*NL*
all
,
but
to
exist
altogether
for
their
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
if
they
like
it
better
?
''
Lvov
said
,
with
his
beautiful
*NL*
smile
,
touching
her
hand
.
``
Anyone
who
did
n't
know
you
would
think
you
*NL*
were
a
stepmother
,
not
a
true
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
extremes
are
not
good
in
anything
,
''
Natalia
said
serenely
,
putting
*NL*
his
paper
knife
straight
in
its
proper
place
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
here
,
you
perfect
children
,
''
Lvov
said
to
the
two
handsome
*NL*
boys
who
came
in
,
and
after
bowing
to
Levin
,
went
up
to
their
father
,
*NL*
obviously
wishing
to
ask
him
about
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
would
have
liked
to
talk
to
them
,
to
hear
what
they
would
say
to
*NL*
their
father
,
but
Natalia
began
talking
to
him
,
and
then
Lvov
's
*NL*
colleague
in
the
service
,
Mahotin
,
walked
in
,
wearing
his
court
uniform
,
*NL*
to
go
with
him
to
meet
someone
,
and
a
conversation
was
kept
up
without
a
*NL*
break
upon
Herzegovina
,
Princess
Korzinskaya
,
the
town
council
,
and
the
*NL*
sudden
death
of
Madame
Apraksina
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
even
forgot
the
commission
intrusted
to
him
.
He
recollected
it
as
*NL*
he
was
going
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Kitty
told
me
to
talk
to
you
about
Oblonsky
,
''
he
said
,
as
Lvov
was
*NL*
standing
on
the
stairs
,
seeing
his
wife
and
Levin
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
maman
wants
us
,
_
les
beaux-freres
,
_
to
attack
him
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
blushing
.
``
But
why
should
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
attack
him
,
''
said
Madame
Lvova
,
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
standing
in
her
white
sheepskin
cape
,
waiting
till
they
had
finished
*NL*
speaking
.
``
Come
,
let
us
go

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
concert
in
the
afternoon
two
very
interesting
things
were
*NL*
performed
.
One
was
a
fantasia
,
_
King
Lear
;
_
the
other
was
a
quartette
*NL*
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
Bach
.
Both
were
new
and
in
the
new
style
,
and
*NL*
Levin
was
eager
to
form
an
opinion
of
them
.
After
escorting
his
*NL*
sister-in-law
to
her
stall
,
he
stood
against
a
column
and
tried
to
*NL*
listen
as
attentively
and
conscientiously
as
possible
.
He
tried
not
to
*NL*
let
his
attention
be
distracted
,
and
not
to
spoil
his
impression
by
*NL*
looking
at
the
conductor
in
a
white
tie
,
waving
his
arms
,
which
always
*NL*
disturbed
his
enjoyment
of
music
so
much
,
or
the
ladies
in
bonnets
,
with
*NL*
strings
carefully
tied
over
their
ears
,
and
all
these
people
either
*NL*
thinking
of
nothing
at
all
or
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
things
except
the
*NL*
music
.
He
tried
to
avoid
meeting
musical
connoisseurs
or
talkative
*NL*
acquaintances
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
floor
straight
before
him
,
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
more
he
listened
to
the
fantasia
of
King
Lear
the
further
he
*NL*
felt
from
forming
any
definite
opinion
of
it
.
There
was
,
as
it
were
,
a
*NL*
continual
beginning
,
a
preparation
of
the
musical
expression
of
some
*NL*
feeling
,
but
it
fell
to
pieces
again
directly
,
breaking
into
new
musical
*NL*
motives
,
or
simply
nothing
but
the
whims
of
the
composer
,
exceedingly
*NL*
complex
but
disconnected
sounds
.
And
these
fragmentary
musical
*NL*
expressions
,
though
sometimes
beautiful
,
were
disagreeable
,
because
they
*NL*
were
utterly
unexpected
and
not
led
up
to
by
anything
.
Gaiety
and
grief
*NL*
and
despair
and
tenderness
and
triumph
followed
one
another
without
any
*NL*
connection
,
like
the
emotions
of
a
madman
.
And
those
emotions
,
like
a
*NL*
madman
's
,
sprang
up
quite
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
the
performance
Levin
felt
like
a
deaf
man
watching
*NL*
people
dancing
,
and
was
in
a
state
of
complete
bewilderment
when
the
*NL*
fantasia
was
over
,
and
felt
a
great
weariness
from
the
fruitless
strain
*NL*
on
his
attention
.
Loud
applause
resounded
on
all
sides
.
Everyone
got
up
,
*NL*
moved
about
,
and
began
talking
.
Anxious
to
throw
some
light
on
his
own
*NL*
perplexity
from
the
impressions
of
others
,
Levin
began
to
walk
about
,
*NL*
looking
for
connoisseurs
,
and
was
glad
to
see
a
well-known
musical
*NL*
amateur
in
conversation
with
Pestsov
,
whom
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marvelous
!
''
Pestsov
was
saying
in
his
mellow
bass
.
``
How
are
you
,
*NL*
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
?
Particularly
sculpturesque
and
plastic
,
so
to
*NL*
say
,
and
richly
colored
is
that
passage
where
you
feel
Cordelia
's
*NL*
approach
,
where
woman
,
_
das
ewig
Weibliche
,
_
enters
into
conflict
with
*NL*
fate
.
Is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
...
what
has
Cordelia
to
do
with
it
?
''
Levin
asked
timidly
,
*NL*
forgetting
that
the
fantasia
was
supposed
to
represent
King
Lear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cordelia
comes
in
...
see
here
!
''
said
Pestsov
,
tapping
his
finger
on
*NL*
the
satiny
surface
of
the
program
he
held
in
his
hand
and
passing
it
to
*NL*
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
then
Levin
recollected
the
title
of
the
fantasia
,
and
made
haste
to
*NL*
read
in
the
Russian
translation
the
lines
from
Shakespeare
that
were
*NL*
printed
on
the
back
of
the
program
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
follow
it
without
that
,
''
said
Pestsov
,
addressing
Levin
,
as
*NL*
the
person
he
had
been
speaking
to
had
gone
away
,
and
he
had
no
one
to
*NL*
talk
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
_
entr
`
acte
_
Levin
and
Pestsov
fell
into
an
argument
upon
the
*NL*
merits
and
defects
of
music
of
the
Wagner
school
.
Levin
maintained
that
*NL*
the
mistake
of
Wagner
and
all
his
followers
lay
in
their
trying
to
take
*NL*
music
into
the
sphere
of
another
art
,
just
as
poetry
goes
wrong
when
it
*NL*
tries
to
paint
a
face
as
the
art
of
painting
ought
to
do
,
and
as
an
*NL*
instance
of
this
mistake
he
cited
the
sculptor
who
carved
in
marble
*NL*
certain
poetic
phantasms
flitting
round
the
figure
of
the
poet
on
the
*NL*
pedestal
.
``
These
phantoms
were
so
far
from
being
phantoms
that
they
were
*NL*
positively
clinging
on
the
ladder
,
''
said
Levin
.
The
comparison
pleased
*NL*
him
,
but
he
could
not
remember
whether
he
had
not
used
the
same
phrase
*NL*
before
,
and
to
Pestsov
,
too
,
and
as
he
said
it
he
felt
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pestsov
maintained
that
art
is
one
,
and
that
it
can
attain
its
highest
*NL*
manifestations
only
by
conjunction
with
all
kinds
of
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
piece
that
was
performed
Levin
could
not
hear
.
Pestsov
,
who
*NL*
was
standing
beside
him
,
was
talking
to
him
almost
all
the
time
,
*NL*
condemning
the
music
for
its
excessive
affected
assumption
of
*NL*
simplicity
,
and
comparing
it
with
the
simplicity
of
the
Pre-Raphaelites
*NL*
in
painting
.
As
he
went
out
Levin
met
many
more
acquaintances
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
talked
of
politics
,
of
music
,
and
of
common
acquaintances
.
Among
*NL*
others
he
met
Count
Bol
,
whom
he
had
utterly
forgotten
to
call
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
at
once
then
,
''
Madame
Lvova
said
,
when
he
told
her
;
``
perhaps
*NL*
they
'll
not
be
at
home
,
and
then
you
can
come
to
the
meeting
to
fetch
*NL*
me
.
You
'll
find
me
still
there
.

``
Perhaps
they
're
not
at
home
?
''
said
Levin
,
as
he
went
into
the
hall
of
*NL*
Countess
Bola
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
home
;
please
walk
in
,
''
said
the
porter
,
resolutely
removing
his
*NL*
overcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
annoying
!
''
thought
Levin
with
a
sigh
,
taking
off
one
glove
and
*NL*
stroking
his
hat
.
``
What
did
I
come
for
?
What
have
I
to
say
to
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
passed
through
the
first
drawing
room
Levin
met
in
the
doorway
*NL*
Countess
Bola
,
giving
some
order
to
a
servant
with
a
care-worn
and
*NL*
severe
face
.
On
seeing
Levin
she
smiled
,
and
asked
him
to
come
into
the
*NL*
little
drawing
room
,
where
he
heard
voices
.
In
this
room
there
were
*NL*
sitting
in
armchairs
the
two
daughters
of
the
countess
,
and
a
Moscow
*NL*
colonel
,
whom
Levin
knew
.
Levin
went
up
,
greeted
them
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
beside
the
sofa
with
his
hat
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your
wife
?
Have
you
been
at
the
concert
?
We
could
n't
go
.
Mamma
*NL*
had
to
be
at
the
funeral
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
heard
...
What
a
sudden
death
!
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countess
came
in
,
sat
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
she
too
asked
after
his
*NL*
wife
and
inquired
about
the
concert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
answered
,
and
repeated
an
inquiry
about
Madame
Apraksina
's
sudden
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
was
always
in
weak
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
at
the
opera
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucca
was
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
good
,
''
he
said
,
and
as
it
was
utterly
of
no
consequence
to
*NL*
him
what
they
thought
of
him
,
he
began
repeating
what
they
had
heard
a
*NL*
hundred
times
about
the
characteristics
of
the
singer
's
talent
.
Countess
*NL*
Bola
pretended
to
be
listening
.
Then
,
when
he
had
said
enough
and
*NL*
paused
,
the
colonel
,
who
had
been
silent
till
then
,
began
to
talk
.
The
*NL*
colonel
too
talked
of
the
opera
,
and
about
culture
.
At
last
,
after
*NL*
speaking
of
the
proposed
_
folle
journee
_
at
Turin
's
,
the
colonel
*NL*
laughed
,
got
up
noisily
,
and
went
away
.
Levin
too
rose
,
but
he
saw
by
*NL*
the
face
of
the
countess
that
it
was
not
yet
time
for
him
to
go
.
He
must
*NL*
stay
two
minutes
longer
.
He
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
was
thinking
all
the
while
how
stupid
it
was
,
he
could
not
*NL*
find
a
subject
for
conversation
,
and
sat
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
going
to
the
public
meeting
?
They
say
it
will
be
very
*NL*
interesting
,
''
began
the
countess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
promised
my
_
belle-soeur
_
to
fetch
her
from
it
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
followed
.
The
mother
once
more
exchanged
glances
with
a
*NL*
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
I
think
the
time
has
come
,
''
thought
Levin
,
and
he
got
up
.
The
*NL*
ladies
shook
hands
with
him
,
and
begged
him
to
say
_
mille
choses
_
to
his
*NL*
wife
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
asked
him
,
as
he
gave
him
his
coat
,
``
Where
is
your
honor
*NL*
staying
?
''
and
immediately
wrote
down
his
address
in
a
big
handsomely
*NL*
bound
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
n't
care
,
but
still
I
feel
ashamed
and
awfully
stupid
,
''
*NL*
thought
Levin
,
consoling
himself
with
the
reflection
that
everyone
does
*NL*
it
.
He
drove
to
the
public
meeting
,
where
he
was
to
find
his
*NL*
sister-in-law
,
so
as
to
drive
home
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
public
meeting
of
the
committee
there
were
a
great
many
people
,
*NL*
and
almost
all
the
highest
society
.
Levin
was
in
time
for
the
report
*NL*
which
,
as
everyone
said
,
was
very
interesting
.
When
the
reading
of
the
*NL*
report
was
over
,
people
moved
about
,
and
Levin
met
Sviazhsky
,
who
*NL*
invited
him
very
pressingly
to
come
that
evening
to
a
meeting
of
the
*NL*
Society
of
Agriculture
,
where
a
celebrated
lecture
was
to
be
delivered
,
*NL*
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
who
had
only
just
come
from
the
races
,
and
many
*NL*
other
acquaintances
;
and
Levin
heard
and
uttered
various
criticisms
on
*NL*
the
meeting
,
on
the
new
fantasia
,
and
on
a
public
trial
.
But
,
probably
*NL*
from
the
mental
fatigue
he
was
beginning
to
feel
,
he
made
a
blunder
in
*NL*
speaking
of
the
trial
,
and
this
blunder
he
recalled
several
times
with
*NL*
vexation
.
Speaking
of
the
sentence
upon
a
foreigner
who
had
been
*NL*
condemned
in
Russia
,
and
of
how
unfair
it
would
be
to
punish
him
by
*NL*
exile
abroad
,
Levin
repeated
what
he
had
heard
the
day
before
in
*NL*
conversation
from
an
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
sending
him
abroad
is
much
the
same
as
punishing
a
carp
by
*NL*
putting
it
into
the
water
,
''
said
Levin
.
Then
he
recollected
that
this
*NL*
idea
,
which
he
had
heard
from
an
acquaintance
and
uttered
as
his
own
,
*NL*
came
from
a
fable
of
Krilov
's
,
and
that
the
acquaintance
had
picked
it
*NL*
up
from
a
newspaper
article
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
driving
home
with
his
sister-in-law
,
and
finding
Kitty
in
good
*NL*
spirits
and
quite
well
,
Levin
drove
to
the
club
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
reached
the
club
just
at
the
right
time
.
Members
and
visitors
were
*NL*
driving
up
as
he
arrived
.
Levin
had
not
been
at
the
club
for
a
very
long
*NL*
while
--
not
since
he
lived
in
Moscow
,
when
he
was
leaving
the
university
*NL*
and
going
into
society
.
He
remembered
the
club
,
the
external
details
of
*NL*
its
arrangement
,
but
he
had
completely
forgotten
the
impression
it
had
*NL*
made
on
him
in
old
days
.
But
as
soon
as
,
driving
into
the
wide
*NL*
semicircular
court
and
getting
out
of
the
sledge
,
he
mounted
the
steps
,
*NL*
and
the
hall
porter
,
adorned
with
a
crossway
scarf
,
noiselessly
opened
*NL*
the
door
to
him
with
a
bow
;
as
soon
as
he
saw
in
the
porter
's
room
the
*NL*
cloaks
and
galoshes
of
members
who
thought
it
less
trouble
to
take
them
*NL*
off
downstairs
;
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
mysterious
ringing
bell
that
*NL*
preceded
him
as
he
ascended
the
easy
,
carpeted
staircase
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
statue
on
the
landing
,
and
the
third
porter
at
the
top
doors
,
a
familiar
*NL*
figure
grown
older
,
in
the
club
livery
,
opening
the
door
without
haste
*NL*
or
delay
,
and
scanning
the
visitors
as
they
passed
in
--
Levin
felt
the
*NL*
old
impression
of
the
club
come
back
in
a
rush
,
an
impression
of
repose
,
*NL*
comfort
,
and
propriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hat
,
please
,
''
the
porter
said
to
Levin
,
who
forgot
the
club
rule
*NL*
to
leave
his
hat
in
the
porter
's
room
.
``
Long
time
since
you
've
been
.
The
*NL*
prince
put
your
name
down
yesterday
.
Prince
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
is
not
*NL*
here
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
did
not
only
know
Levin
,
but
also
all
his
ties
and
*NL*
relationships
,
and
so
immediately
mentioned
his
intimate
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
through
the
outer
hall
,
divided
up
by
screens
,
and
the
room
*NL*
partitioned
on
the
right
,
where
a
man
sits
at
the
fruit
buffet
,
Levin
*NL*
overtook
an
old
man
walking
slowly
in
,
and
entered
the
dining
room
full
*NL*
of
noise
and
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
along
the
tables
,
almost
all
full
,
and
looked
at
the
visitors
.
*NL*
He
saw
people
of
all
sorts
,
old
and
young
;
some
he
knew
a
little
,
some
*NL*
intimate
friends
.
There
was
not
a
single
cross
or
worried-looking
face
.
*NL*
All
seemed
to
have
left
their
cares
and
anxieties
in
the
porter
's
room
*NL*
with
their
hats
,
and
were
all
deliberately
getting
ready
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
material
blessings
of
life
.
Sviazhsky
was
here
and
Shtcherbatsky
,
*NL*
Nevyedovsky
and
the
old
prince
,
and
Vronsky
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
why
are
you
late
?
''
the
prince
said
smiling
,
and
giving
him
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
own
shoulder
.
``
How
's
Kitty
?
''
he
added
,
smoothing
out
the
napkin
*NL*
he
had
tucked
in
at
his
waistcoat
buttons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
they
are
dining
at
home
,
all
the
three
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
`
Aline-Nadine
,
'
to
be
sure
!
There
's
no
room
with
us
.
Go
to
that
*NL*
table
,
and
make
haste
and
take
a
seat
,
''
said
the
prince
,
and
turning
*NL*
away
he
carefully
took
a
plate
of
eel
soup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Levin
,
this
way
!
''
a
good-natured
voice
shouted
a
little
farther
on
.
It
*NL*
was
Turovtsin
.
He
was
sitting
with
a
young
officer
,
and
beside
them
were
*NL*
two
chairs
turned
upside
down
.
Levin
gladly
went
up
to
them
.
He
had
*NL*
always
liked
the
good-hearted
rake
,
Turovtsin
--
he
was
associated
in
his
*NL*
mind
with
memories
of
his
courtship
--
and
at
that
moment
,
after
the
*NL*
strain
of
intellectual
conversation
,
the
sight
of
Turovtsin
's
*NL*
good-natured
face
was
particularly
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
and
Oblonsky
.
He
'll
be
here
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
holding
himself
very
erect
,
with
eyes
forever
twinkling
*NL*
with
enjoyment
,
was
an
officer
from
Petersburg
,
Gagin
.
Turovtsin
*NL*
introduced
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oblonsky
's
always
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
here
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
only
just
come
?
''
said
Oblonsky
,
coming
quickly
towards
them
.
*NL*
``
Good
day
.
Had
some
vodka
?
Well
,
come
along
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
got
up
and
went
with
him
to
the
big
table
spread
with
spirits
and
*NL*
appetizers
of
the
most
various
kinds
.
One
would
have
thought
that
out
of
*NL*
two
dozen
delicacies
one
might
find
something
to
one
's
taste
,
but
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
asked
for
something
special
,
and
one
of
the
liveried
*NL*
waiters
standing
by
immediately
brought
what
was
required
.
They
drank
a
*NL*
wine
glassful
and
returned
to
their
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
,
while
they
were
still
at
the
soup
,
Gagin
was
served
with
*NL*
champagne
,
and
told
the
waiter
to
fill
four
glasses
.
Levin
did
not
*NL*
refuse
the
wine
,
and
asked
for
a
second
bottle
.
He
was
very
hungry
,
and
*NL*
ate
and
drank
with
great
enjoyment
,
and
with
still
greater
enjoyment
*NL*
took
part
in
the
lively
and
simple
conversation
of
his
companions
.
*NL*
Gagin
,
dropping
his
voice
,
told
the
last
good
story
from
Petersburg
,
and
*NL*
the
story
,
though
improper
and
stupid
,
was
so
ludicrous
that
Levin
broke
*NL*
into
roars
of
laughter
so
loud
that
those
near
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
in
the
same
style
as
,
`
that
's
a
thing
I
ca
n't
endure
!
'
You
know
*NL*
the
story
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Ah
,
that
's
exquisite
!
Another
*NL*
bottle
,
''
he
said
to
the
waiter
,
and
he
began
to
relate
his
good
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Illyitch
Vinovsky
invites
you
to
drink
with
him
,
''
a
little
old
*NL*
waiter
interrupted
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
bringing
two
delicate
glasses
of
*NL*
sparkling
champagne
,
and
addressing
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
and
Levin
.
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
the
glass
,
and
looking
towards
a
bald
man
with
*NL*
red
mustaches
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
he
nodded
to
him
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
asked
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
met
him
once
at
my
place
,
do
n't
you
remember
?
A
good-natured
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
did
the
same
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
and
took
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
anecdote
too
was
very
amusing
.
Levin
told
his
*NL*
story
,
and
that
too
was
successful
.
Then
they
talked
of
horses
,
of
the
*NL*
races
,
of
what
they
had
been
doing
that
day
,
and
of
how
smartly
*NL*
Vronsky
's
Atlas
had
won
the
first
prize
.
Levin
did
not
notice
how
the
*NL*
time
passed
at
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
and
here
they
are
!
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
towards
the
end
of
*NL*
dinner
,
leaning
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
holding
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
Vronsky
,
who
came
up
with
a
tall
officer
of
the
Guards
.
Vronsky
's
face
*NL*
too
beamed
with
the
look
of
good-humored
enjoyment
that
was
general
in
*NL*
the
club
.
He
propped
his
elbow
playfully
on
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
*NL*
shoulder
,
whispering
something
to
him
,
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
Levin
*NL*
with
the
same
good-humored
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
to
meet
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
looked
out
for
you
at
the
election
,
*NL*
but
I
was
told
you
had
gone
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
left
the
same
day
.
We
've
just
been
talking
of
your
horse
.
I
*NL*
congratulate
you
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
It
was
very
rapidly
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
've
race
horses
too
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
father
had
;
but
I
remember
and
know
something
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
dined
?
''
asked
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
at
the
second
table
,
behind
the
columns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
been
celebrating
his
success
,
''
said
the
tall
colonel
.
``
It
's
his
*NL*
second
Imperial
prize
.
I
wish
I
might
have
the
luck
at
cards
he
has
with
*NL*
horses
.
Well
,
why
waste
the
precious
time
?
I
'm
going
to
the
`
infernal
*NL*
regions
,
'
''
added
the
colonel
,
and
he
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Yashvin
,
''
Vronsky
said
in
answer
to
Turovtsin
,
and
he
sat
down
*NL*
in
the
vacated
seat
beside
them
.
He
drank
the
glass
offered
him
,
and
*NL*
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
.
Under
the
influence
of
the
club
atmosphere
or
*NL*
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
Levin
chatted
away
to
Vronsky
of
the
best
breeds
*NL*
of
cattle
,
and
was
very
glad
not
to
feel
the
slightest
hostility
to
this
*NL*
man
.
He
even
told
him
,
among
other
things
,
that
he
had
heard
from
his
*NL*
wife
that
she
had
met
him
at
Princess
Marya
Borissovna
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Princess
Marya
Borissovna
,
she
's
exquisite
!
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
and
he
told
an
anecdote
about
her
which
set
them
all
*NL*
laughing
.
Vronsky
particularly
laughed
with
such
simplehearted
amusement
*NL*
that
Levin
felt
quite
reconciled
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
we
finished
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
getting
up
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
``
Let
us
go

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Getting
up
from
the
table
,
Levin
walked
with
Gagin
through
the
lofty
*NL*
room
to
the
billiard
room
,
feeling
his
arms
swing
as
he
walked
with
a
*NL*
peculiar
lightness
and
ease
.
As
he
crossed
the
big
room
,
he
came
upon
*NL*
his
father-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
do
you
like
our
Temple
of
Indolence
?
''
said
the
prince
,
taking
*NL*
his
arm
.
``
Come
along
,
come
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wanted
to
walk
about
and
look
at
everything
.
It
's
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
interesting
for
you
.
But
its
interest
for
me
is
quite
*NL*
different
.
You
look
at
those
little
old
men
now
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
a
*NL*
club
member
with
bent
back
and
projecting
lip
,
shuffling
towards
them
in
*NL*
his
soft
boots
,
``
and
imagine
that
they
were
_
shlupiks
_
like
that
from
*NL*
their
birth
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
_
shlupiks
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
do
n't
know
that
name

That
's
our
club
designation
.
You
know
*NL*
the
game
of
rolling
eggs
:
when
one
's
rolled
a
long
while
it
becomes
a
*NL*
_
shlupik
_
.
So
it
is
with
us
;
one
goes
on
coming
and
coming
to
the
club
,
*NL*
and
ends
by
becoming
a
_
shlupik
_
.
Ah
,
you
laugh
!
but
we
look
out
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
dropping
into
it
ourselves
.
You
know
Prince
Tchetchensky
?
''
*NL*
inquired
the
prince
;
and
Levin
saw
by
his
face
that
he
was
just
going
to
*NL*
relate
something
funny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
know
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so

Well

Prince
Tchetchensky
is
a
well-known
figure

No
*NL*
matter
,
though
.
He
's
always
playing
billiards
here
.
Only
three
years
ago
*NL*
he
was
not
a
_
shlupik
_
and
kept
up
his
spirits
and
even
used
to
call

other
people

But
one
day
he
turns
up

our

know
Vassily
?
Why
,
that
fat
one
;
he
's
famous
for
his
_
bon
mots
_
.
And
so
*NL*
Prince
Tchetchensky
asks
him
,

Come
,
Vassily
,
who
's
here
?
Any
_
shlupiks

here

And
he
says
,
`
You
're
the
third

Yes
,
my
dear
boy
,
that
he
*NL*
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Talking
and
greeting
the
friends
they
met
,
Levin
and
the
prince
walked
*NL*
through
all
the
rooms
:
the
great
room
where
tables
had
already
been
set
,
*NL*
and
the
usual
partners
were
playing
for
small
stakes
;
the
divan
room
,
*NL*
where
they
were
playing
chess
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
sitting
talking
*NL*
to
somebody
;
the
billiard
room
,
where
,
about
a
sofa
in
a
recess
,
there
*NL*
was
a
lively
party
drinking
champagne
--
Gagin
was
one
of
them
.
They
*NL*
peeped
into
the
``
infernal
regions
,
''
where
a
good
many
men
were
crowding
*NL*
round
one
table
,
at
which
Yashvin
was
sitting
.
Trying
not
to
make
a
*NL*
noise
,
they
walked
into
the
dark
reading
room
,
where
under
the
shaded
*NL*
lamps
there
sat
a
young
man
with
a
wrathful
countenance
,
turning
over
*NL*
one
journal
after
another
,
and
a
bald
general
buried
in
a
book
.
They
*NL*
went
,
too
,
into
what
the
prince
called
the
intellectual
room
,
where
*NL*
three
gentlemen
were
engaged
in
a
heated
discussion
of
the
latest
*NL*
political
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prince
,
please
come
,
we
're
ready
,
''
said
one
of
his
card
party
,
who
had
*NL*
come
to
look
for
him
,
and
the
prince
went
off
.
Levin
sat
down
and
*NL*
listened
,
but
recalling
all
the
conversation
of
the
morning
he
felt
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
fearfully
bored
.
He
got
up
hurriedly
,
and
went
to
look
for
*NL*
Oblonsky
and
Turovtsin
,
with
whom
it
had
been
so
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turovtsin
was
one
of
the
circle
drinking
in
the
billiard
room
,
and
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
talking
with
Vronsky
near
the
door
at
the
*NL*
farther
corner
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
she
's
dull
;
but
this
undefined
,
this
unsettled
position
,
''
*NL*
Levin
caught
,
and
he
was
hurrying
away
,
but
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
called
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Levin
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
Levin
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
*NL*
not
full
of
tears
exactly
,
but
moist
,
which
always
happened
when
he
had
*NL*
been
drinking
,
or
when
he
was
touched
.
Just
now
it
was
due
to
both
*NL*
causes
.
``
Levin
,
do
n't
go
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
warmly
squeezed
his
arm
above
*NL*
the
elbow
,
obviously
not
at
all
wishing
to
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
true
friend
of
mine
--
almost
my
greatest
friend
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Vronsky
.
``
You
have
become
even
closer
and
dearer
to
me
.
And
I
want
you
,
*NL*
and
I
know
you
ought
,
to
be
friends
,
and
great
friends
,
because
you
're
*NL*
both
splendid
fellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
nothing
for
us
now
but
to
kiss
and
be
friends
,
''
Vronsky
*NL*
said
,
with
good-natured
playfulness
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
quickly
took
the
offered
hand
,
and
pressed
it
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
,
very
glad
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiter
,
a
bottle
of
champagne
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
very
glad
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
spite
of
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
desire
,
and
their
own
desire
,
they
*NL*
had
nothing
to
talk
about
,
and
both
felt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
he
has
never
met
Anna
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
*NL*
Vronsky
.
``
And
I
want
above
everything
to
take
him
to
see
her
.
Let
us
go
,
*NL*
Levin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
Vronsky
.
``
She
will
be
very
glad
to
see
you
.
I
should
be
*NL*
going
home
at
once
,
''
he
added
,
``
but
I
'm
worried
about
Yashvin
,
and
I
*NL*
want
to
stay
on
till
he
finishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
he
losing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
keeps
losing
,
and
I
'm
the
only
friend
that
can
restrain
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
to
pyramids
?
Levin
,
will
you
play
?
Capital
!
''
said
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Get
the
table
ready
,
''
he
said
to
the
marker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
ready
a
long
while
,
''
answered
the
marker
,
who
had
already
*NL*
set
the
balls
in
a
triangle
,
and
was
knocking
the
red
one
about
for
his
*NL*
own
diversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
us
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
game
Vronsky
and
Levin
sat
down
at
Gagin
's
table
,
and
at
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
suggestion
Levin
took
a
hand
in
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
sat
down
at
the
table
,
surrounded
by
friends
,
who
were
*NL*
incessantly
coming
up
to
him
.
Every
now
and
then
he
went
to
the
*NL*
``
infernal
''
to
keep
an
eye
on
Yashvin
.
Levin
was
enjoying
a
delightful
*NL*
sense
of
repose
after
the
mental
fatigue
of
the
morning
.
He
was
glad
*NL*
that
all
hostility
was
at
an
end
with
Vronsky
,
and
the
sense
of
peace
,
*NL*
decorum
,
and
comfort
never
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
game
was
over
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
took
Levin
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
us
go
to
Anna
's
,
then
.
At
once
?
Eh
?
She
is
at
home
.
I
*NL*
promised
her
long
ago
to
bring
you
.
Where
were
you
meaning
to
spend
the
*NL*
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nowhere
specially
.
I
promised
Sviazhsky
to
go
to
the
Society
of
*NL*
Agriculture
.
By
all
means
,
let
us
go
,
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
;
come
along
.
Find
out
if
my
carriage
is
here
,
''
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
said
to
the
waiter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
up
to
the
table
,
paid
the
forty
roubles
he
had
lost
;
paid
his
*NL*
bill
,
the
amount
of
which
was
in
some
mysterious
way
ascertained
by
the
*NL*
little
old
waiter
who
stood
at
the
counter
,
and
swinging
his
arms
he
*NL*
walked
through
all
the
rooms
to
the
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oblonsky
's
carriage
!
''
the
porter
shouted
in
an
angry
bass
.
The
carriage
*NL*
drove
up
and
both
got
in
.
It
was
only
for
the
first
few
moments
,
while
*NL*
the
carriage
was
driving
out
of
the
clubhouse
gates
,
that
Levin
was
*NL*
still
under
the
influence
of
the
club
atmosphere
of
repose
,
comfort
,
and
*NL*
unimpeachable
good
form
.
But
as
soon
as
the
carriage
drove
out
into
the
*NL*
street
,
and
he
felt
it
jolting
over
the
uneven
road
,
heard
the
angry
*NL*
shout
of
a
sledge
driver
coming
towards
them
,
saw
in
the
uncertain
light
*NL*
the
red
blind
of
a
tavern
and
the
shops
,
this
impression
was
dissipated
,
*NL*
and
he
began
to
think
over
his
actions
,
and
to
wonder
whether
he
was
*NL*
doing
right
in
going
to
see
Anna
.
What
would
Kitty
say
?
But
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
gave
him
no
time
for
reflection
,
and
,
as
though
divining
*NL*
his
doubts
,
he
scattered
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
you
should
know
her
!
You
know
Dolly
has
*NL*
long
wished
for
it
.
And
Lvov
's
been
to
see
her
,
and
often
goes
.
Though
*NL*
she
is
my
sister
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
pursued
,
``
I
do
n't
hesitate
to
say
*NL*
that
she
's
a
remarkable
woman
.
But
you
will
see
.
Her
position
is
very
*NL*
painful
,
especially
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
especially
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
carrying
on
negotiations
with
her
husband
about
a
divorce
.
And
*NL*
he
's
agreed
;
but
there
are
difficulties
in
regard
to
the
son
,
and
the
*NL*
business
,
which
ought
to
have
been
arranged
long
ago
,
has
been
dragging
*NL*
on
for
three
months
past
.
As
soon
as
the
divorce
is
over
,
she
will
marry
*NL*
Vronsky
.
How
stupid
these
old
ceremonies
are
,
that
no
one
believes
in
,
*NL*
and
which
only
prevent
people
being
comfortable
!
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
put
in
.
``
Well
,
then
their
position
will
be
as
regular
as
mine
,
as
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
difficulty
?
''
said
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
a
long
and
tedious
story
!
The
whole
business
is
in
such
an
*NL*
anomalous
position
with
us
.
But
the
point
is
she
has
been
for
three
*NL*
months
in
Moscow
,
where
everyone
knows
her
,
waiting
for
the
divorce
;
she
*NL*
goes
out
nowhere
,
sees
no
woman
except
Dolly
,
because
,
do
you
*NL*
understand
,
she
does
n't
care
to
have
people
come
as
a
favor
.
That
fool
*NL*
Princess
Varvara
,
even
she
has
left
her
,
considering
this
a
breach
of
*NL*
propriety

Well
,
you
see
,
in
such
a
position
any
other
woman
would
not
*NL*
have
found
resources
in
herself
.
But
you
'll
see
how
she
has
arranged
her
*NL*
life
--
how
calm
,
how
dignified
she
is

To
the
left
,
in
the
crescent
*NL*
opposite
the
church
!

shouted
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
leaning
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
``
Phew
!
how
hot
it
is
!
''
he
said
,
in
spite
of
twelve
degrees
of
*NL*
frost
,
flinging
his
open
overcoat
still
wider
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
has
a
daughter
:
no
doubt
she
's
busy
looking
after
her
?

said
*NL*
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
picture
every
woman
simply
as
a
female

_
une
couveuse

*NL*
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
If
she
's
occupied
,
it
must
be
with
her
*NL*
children
.
No
,
she
brings
her
up
capitally
,
I
believe
,
but
one
does
n't
*NL*
hear
about
her
.
She
's
busy
,
in
the
first
place
,
with
what
she
writes

I
*NL*
see
you
're
smiling
ironically

but
you
're
wrong

She
's
writing
a
*NL*
children
's
book
,
and
does
n't
talk
about
it
to
anyone
,
but
she
read
it
to
*NL*
me
and
I
gave
the
manuscript
to
Vorkuev
...
you
know
the
publisher
...
*NL*
and
he
's
an
author
himself
too
,
I
fancy
.
He
understands
those
things

*NL*
and
he
says
it
's
a
remarkable
piece
of
work

But
are
you
fancying
she
's
*NL*
an
authoress

not
a

of
it

She
's
a
woman
with
a
heart

before
*NL*
everything

but
you
'll
see
.
Now
she
has
a
little
English
girl
with
her
,
*NL*
and
a
whole
family
she
's
looking
after
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

something
in
a
philanthropic
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
will
look
at
everything
in
the
worst
light

It
's
not
from
*NL*
philanthropy

it
's
from
the
heart
.
They
--
that
is
,
Vronsky
--
had
a
*NL*
trainer
,
an
Englishman
,
first-rate
in
his
own
line
,
but
a
drunkard

He
's
*NL*
completely
given
up
to
drink
--
delirium
tremens
--
and
the
family
were
cast
*NL*
on
the
world
.
She
saw
them
,
helped
them
,
got
more
and
more
interested
in
*NL*
them
,
and
now
the
whole
family
is
on
her
hands
.
But
not
by
way
of
*NL*
patronage
,
you
know
,
helping
with
money
;
she
's
herself
preparing
the
*NL*
boys
in
Russian
for
the
high
school
,
and
she
's
taken
the
little
girl
to
*NL*
live
with
her

But
you
'll
see
her
for
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
drove
into
the
courtyard
,
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
rang
*NL*
loudly
at
the
entrance
where
sledges
were
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
asking
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
whether
the
lady
were
*NL*
at
home
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
walked
into
the
hall
.
Levin
followed
him
,
*NL*
more
and
more
doubtful
whether
he
was
doing
right
or
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
at
himself
in
the
glass
,
Levin
noticed
that
he
was
red
in
the
*NL*
face
,
but
he
felt
certain
he
was
not
drunk
,
and
he
followed
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
up
the
carpeted
stairs
.
At
the
top
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
inquired
of
the
footman
,
who
bowed
to
him
as
to
an
intimate
friend
,
who
*NL*
was
with
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
and
received
the
answer
that
it
was
M.
*NL*
Vorkuev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
study

''
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
through
the
dining
room
,
a
room
not
very
large
,
with
dark
,
*NL*
paneled
walls
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
and
Levin
walked
over
the
soft
carpet
*NL*
to
the
half-dark
study
,
lighted
up
by
a
single
lamp
with
a
big
dark
*NL*
shade
.
Another
lamp
with
a
reflector
was
hanging
on
the
wall
,
lighting
*NL*
up
a
big
full-length
portrait
of
a
woman
,
which
Levin
could
not
help
*NL*
looking
at
.
It
was
the
portrait
of
Anna
,
painted
in
Italy
by
Mihailov
.
*NL*
While
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
behind
the
_
treillage
_
,
and
the
man
's
*NL*
voice
which
had
been
speaking
paused
,
Levin
gazed
at
the
portrait
,
which
*NL*
stood
out
from
the
frame
in
the
brilliant
light
thrown
on
it
,
and
he
*NL*
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
it
.
He
positively
forgot
where
he
was
,
*NL*
and
not
even
hearing
what
was
said
,
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
the
*NL*
marvelous
portrait
.
It
was
not
a
picture
,
but
a
living
,
charming
woman
,
*NL*
with
black
curling
hair
,
with
bare
arms
and
shoulders
,
with
a
pensive
*NL*
smile
on
the
lips
,
covered
with
soft
down
;
triumphantly
and
softly
she
*NL*
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
baffled
him
.
She
was
not
living
only
*NL*
because
she
was
more
beautiful
than
a
living
woman
can
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
!
''
He
heard
suddenly
near
him
a
voice
,
unmistakably
*NL*
addressing
him
,
the
voice
of
the
very
woman
he
had
been
admiring
in
the
*NL*
portrait
.
Anna
had
come
from
behind
the
treillage
to
meet
him
,
and
Levin
*NL*
saw
in
the
dim
light
of
the
study
the
very
woman
of
the
portrait
,
in
a
*NL*
dark
blue
shot
gown
,
not
in
the
same
position
nor
with
the
same
*NL*
expression
,
but
with
the
same
perfection
of
beauty
which
the
artist
had
*NL*
caught
in
the
portrait
.
She
was
less
dazzling
in
reality
,
but
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
there
was
something
fresh
and
seductive
in
the
living
woman
*NL*
which
was
not
in
the
portrait
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
risen
to
meet
him
,
not
concealing
her
pleasure
at
seeing
him
;
*NL*
and
in
the
quiet
ease
with
which
she
held
out
her
little
vigorous
hand
,
*NL*
introduced
him
to
Vorkuev
and
indicated
a
red-haired
,
pretty
little
girl
*NL*
who
was
sitting
at
work
,
calling
her
her
pupil
,
Levin
recognized
and
*NL*
liked
the
manners
of
a
woman
of
the
great
world
,
always
self-possessed
*NL*
and
natural
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
,
delighted
,
''
she
repeated
,
and
on
her
lips
these
simple
*NL*
words
took
for
Levin
's
ears
a
special
significance
.
``
I
have
known
you
*NL*
and
liked
you
for
a
long
while
,
both
from
your
friendship
with
Stiva
and
*NL*
for
your
wife
's
sake
...
I
knew
her
for
a
very
short
time
,
but
she
left
*NL*
on
me
the
impression
of
an
exquisite
flower
,
simply
a
flower
.
And
to
*NL*
think
she
will
soon
be
a
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
easily
and
without
haste
,
looking
now
and
then
from
Levin
to
*NL*
her
brother
,
and
Levin
felt
that
the
impression
he
was
making
was
good
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
immediately
at
home
,
simple
and
happy
with
her
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
known
her
from
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ivan
Petrovitch
and
I
settled
in
Alexey
's
study
,
''
she
said
in
answer
to
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
question
whether
he
might
smoke
,
``
just
so
as
to
be
*NL*
able
to
smoke
''
--
and
glancing
at
Levin
,
instead
of
asking
whether
he
*NL*
would
smoke
,
she
pulled
closer
a
tortoise-shell
cigar-case
and
took
a
*NL*
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
feeling
today
?
''
her
brother
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
.
Nerves
,
as
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
is
n't
it
extraordinarily
fine
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
noticing
*NL*
that
Levin
was
scrutinizing
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
seen
a
better
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
extraordinarily
like
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Vorkuev
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
from
the
portrait
to
the
original
.
A
peculiar
brilliance
*NL*
lighted
up
Anna
's
face
when
she
felt
his
eyes
on
her
.
Levin
flushed
,
and
*NL*
to
cover
his
confusion
would
have
asked
whether
she
had
seen
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
lately
;
but
at
that
moment
Anna
spoke
.
``
We
were
just
*NL*
talking
,
Ivan
Petrovitch
and
I
,
of
Vashtchenkov
's
last
pictures
.
Have
*NL*
you
seen
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
seen
them
,
''
answered
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
interrupted
you
...
you
were
saying
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
asked
if
she
had
seen
Dolly
lately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
here
yesterday
.
She
was
very
indignant
with
the
high
school
*NL*
people
on
Grisha
's
account
.
The
Latin
teacher
,
it
seems
,
had
been
unfair
*NL*
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
seen
his
pictures
.
I
did
n't
care
for
them
very
much
,
''
Levin
*NL*
went
back
to
the
subject
she
had
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
talked
now
not
at
all
with
that
purely
businesslike
attitude
to
*NL*
the
subject
with
which
he
had
been
talking
all
the
morning
.
Every
word
*NL*
in
his
conversation
with
her
had
a
special
significance
.
And
talking
to
*NL*
her
was
pleasant
;
still
pleasanter
it
was
to
listen
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
talked
not
merely
naturally
and
cleverly
,
but
cleverly
and
*NL*
carelessly
,
attaching
no
value
to
her
own
ideas
and
giving
great
weight
*NL*
to
the
ideas
of
the
person
she
was
talking
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
turned
on
the
new
movement
in
art
,
on
the
new
*NL*
illustrations
of
the
Bible
by
a
French
artist
.
Vorkuev
attacked
the
*NL*
artist
for
a
realism
carried
to
the
point
of
coarseness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
said
that
the
French
had
carried
conventionality
further
than
*NL*
anyone
,
and
that
consequently
they
see
a
great
merit
in
the
return
to
*NL*
realism
.
In
the
fact
of
not
lying
they
see
poetry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
anything
clever
said
by
Levin
given
him
so
much
pleasure
as
*NL*
this
remark
.
Anna
's
face
lighted
up
at
once
,
as
at
once
she
appreciated
*NL*
the
thought
.
She
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
laugh
,
''
she
said
,
``
as
one
laughs
when
one
sees
a
very
true
portrait
.
*NL*
What
you
said
so
perfectly
hits
off
French
art
now
,
painting
and
*NL*
literature
too
,
indeed
--
Zola
,
Daudet
.
But
perhaps
it
is
always
so
,
that
*NL*
men
form
their
conceptions
from
fictitious
,
conventional
types
,
and
*NL*
then
--
all
the
_
combinaisons
_
made
--
they
are
tired
of
the
fictitious
*NL*
figures
and
begin
to
invent
more
natural
,
true
figures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
perfectly
true
,
''
said
Vorknev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
been
at
the
club
?
''
she
said
to
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
this
is
a
woman
!
''
Levin
thought
,
forgetting
himself
and
*NL*
staring
persistently
at
her
lovely
,
mobile
face
,
which
at
that
moment
*NL*
was
all
at
once
completely
transformed
.
Levin
did
not
hear
what
she
was
*NL*
talking
of
as
she
leaned
over
to
her
brother
,
but
he
was
struck
by
the
*NL*
change
of
her
expression
.
Her
face
--
so
handsome
a
moment
before
in
its
*NL*
repose
--
suddenly
wore
a
look
of
strange
curiosity
,
anger
,
and
pride
.
But
*NL*
this
lasted
only
an
instant
.
She
dropped
her
eyelids
,
as
though
*NL*
recollecting
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
but
that
's
of
no
interest
to
anyone
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
*NL*
turned
to
the
English
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
order
the
tea
in
the
drawing
room
,
''
she
said
in
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
got
up
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
did
she
get
through
her
examination
?
''
asked
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendidly
!
She
's
a
very
gifted
child
and
a
sweet
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
end
in
your
loving
her
more
than
your
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
a
man
speaks
.
In
love
there
's
no
more
nor
less
.
I
love
my
*NL*
daughter
with
one
love
,
and
her
with
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
telling
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
said
Vorkuev
,
``
that
if
she
were
to
*NL*
put
a
hundredth
part
of
the
energy
she
devotes
to
this
English
girl
to
*NL*
the
public
question
of
the
education
of
Russian
children
,
she
would
be
*NL*
doing
a
great
and
useful
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
;
I
could
n't
do
it
.
Count
Alexey
Kirillovitch
*NL*
urged
me
very
much
''
-LRB-
as
she
uttered
the
words
_
Count
Alexey
*NL*
Kirillovitch
_
she
glanced
with
appealing
timidity
at
Levin
,
and
he
*NL*
unconsciously
responded
with
a
respectful
and
reassuring
look
-RRB-
;
``
he
*NL*
urged
me
to
take
up
the
school
in
the
village
.
I
visited
it
several
*NL*
times
.
The
children
were
very
nice
,
but
I
could
not
feel
drawn
to
the
*NL*
work
.
You
speak
of
energy
.
Energy
rests
upon
love
;
and
come
as
it
will
,
*NL*
there
's
no
forcing
it
.
I
took
to
this
child
--
I
could
not
myself
say
*NL*
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
glanced
again
at
Levin
.
And
her
smile
and
her
glance
--
all
told
*NL*
him
that
it
was
to
him
only
she
was
addressing
her
words
,
valuing
his
*NL*
good
opinion
,
and
at
the
same
time
sure
beforehand
that
they
understood
*NL*
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
that
,
''
Levin
answered
.
``
It
's
impossible
to
give
*NL*
one
's
heart
to
a
school
or
such
institutions
in
general
,
and
I
believe
*NL*
that
's
just
why
philanthropic
institutions
always
give
such
poor
*NL*
results
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
a
while
,
then
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
she
agreed
;
``
I
never
could
.
_
Je
n'ai
pas
le

assez

*NL*
large
to
love
a
whole
asylum

horrid
little
girls

_
Cela

_
There
are
so
many
women
who
have
made
themselves
_
une
position
*NL*
sociale
_
in
that
way
.
And
now
more
than
ever
,
''
she
said
with
a
mournful
,
*NL*
confiding
expression
,
ostensibly
addressing
her
brother
,
but
*NL*
unmistakably
intending
her
words
only
for
Levin
,
``
now
when
I
have
such
*NL*
need
of
some
occupation
,
I
can
not
.
''
And
suddenly
frowning
-LRB-
Levin
saw
*NL*
that
she
was
frowning
at
herself
for
talking
about
herself
-RRB-
she
changed
*NL*
the
subject
.
``
I
know
about
you
,
''
she
said
to
Levin
;
``
that
you
're
not
a
*NL*
public-spirited
citizen
,
and
I
have
defended
you
to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
ability
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
defended
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
according
to
the
attacks
made
on
you
.
But
wo
n't
you
have
some
tea
?
''
*NL*
She
rose
and
took
up
a
book
bound
in
morocco
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
''
said
Vorkuev
,
indicating
the
book
.
*NL*
``
It
's
well
worth
taking
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
it
's
all
so
sketchy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
him
about
it
,
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
his
sister
,
nodding
*NL*
at
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
.
My
writing
is
something
after
the
fashion
of
those
*NL*
little
baskets
and
carving
which
Liza
Mertsalova
used
to
sell
me
from
*NL*
the
prisons
.
She
had
the
direction
of
the
prison
department
in
that
*NL*
society
,
''
she
turned
to
Levin
;
``
and
they
were
miracles
of
patience
,
the
*NL*
work
of
those
poor
wretches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
saw
a
new
trait
in
this
woman
,
who
attracted
him
so
*NL*
extraordinarily
.
Besides
wit
,
grace
,
and
beauty
,
she
had
truth
.
She
had
*NL*
no
wish
to
hide
from
him
all
the
bitterness
of
her
position
.
As
she
said
*NL*
that
she
sighed
,
and
her
face
suddenly
taking
a
hard
expression
,
looked
*NL*
as
it
were
turned
to
stone
.
With
that
expression
on
her
face
she
was
*NL*
more
beautiful
than
ever
;
but
the
expression
was
new
;
it
was
utterly
*NL*
unlike
that
expression
,
radiant
with
happiness
and
creating
happiness
,
*NL*
which
had
been
caught
by
the
painter
in
her
portrait
.
Levin
looked
more
*NL*
than
once
at
the
portrait
and
at
her
figure
,
as
taking
her
brother
's
arm
*NL*
she
walked
with
him
to
the
high
doors
and
he
felt
for
her
a
tenderness
*NL*
and
pity
at
which
he
wondered
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
Levin
and
Vorkuev
to
go
into
the
drawing
room
,
while
she
*NL*
stayed
behind
to
say
a
few
words
to
her
brother
.
``
About
her
divorce
,
*NL*
about
Vronsky
,
and
what
he
's
doing
at
the
club
,
about
me
?
''
wondered
*NL*
Levin
.
And
he
was
so
keenly
interested
by
the
question
of
what
she
was
*NL*
saying
to
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
that
he
scarcely
heard
what
Vorkuev
was
*NL*
telling
him
of
the
qualities
of
the
story
for
children
Anna
Arkadyevna
*NL*
had
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
tea
the
same
pleasant
sort
of
talk
,
full
of
interesting
matter
,
*NL*
continued
.
There
was
not
a
single
instant
when
a
subject
for
*NL*
conversation
was
to
seek
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
felt
that
one
had
*NL*
hardly
time
to
say
what
one
had
to
say
,
and
eagerly
held
back
to
hear
*NL*
what
the
others
were
saying
.
And
all
that
was
said
,
not
only
by
her
,
but
*NL*
by
Vorkuev
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
--
all
,
so
it
seemed
to
Levin
,
gained
*NL*
peculiar
significance
from
her
appreciation
and
her
criticism
.
While
he
*NL*
followed
this
interesting
conversation
,
Levin
was
all
the
time
admiring
*NL*
her
--
her
beauty
,
her
intelligence
,
her
culture
,
and
at
the
same
time
her
*NL*
directness
and
genuine
depth
of
feeling
.
He
listened
and
talked
,
and
all
*NL*
the
while
he
was
thinking
of
her
inner
life
,
trying
to
divine
her
*NL*
feelings
.
And
though
he
had
judged
her
so
severely
hitherto
,
now
by
some
*NL*
strange
chain
of
reasoning
he
was
justifying
her
and
was
also
sorry
for
*NL*
her
,
and
afraid
that
Vronsky
did
not
fully
understand
her
.
At
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
,
when
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
got
up
to
go
-LRB-
Vorkuev
had
left
*NL*
earlier
-RRB-
,
it
seemed
to
Levin
that
he
had
only
just
come
.
Regretfully
*NL*
Levin
too
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
said
,
holding
his
hand
and
glancing
into
his
face
with
a
*NL*
winning
look
.
``
I
am
very
glad
_
que
la
glace
est
rompue

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
his
hand
,
and
half
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
your
wife
that
I
love
her
as
before
,
and
that
if
she
can
not
pardon
*NL*
me
my
position
,
then
my
wish
for
her
is
that
she
may
never
pardon
it
.
To
*NL*
pardon
it
,
one
must
go
through
what
I
have
gone
through
,
and
may
God
*NL*
spare
her
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
yes
,
I
will
tell
her
...

Levin
said
,
blushing

*NL*
``
What
a

sweet

he
was
thinking
,
as
he
*NL*
stepped
out
into
the
frosty
air
with
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
n't
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
seeing
that
Levin
*NL*
had
been
completely
won
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Levin
dreamily
,
``
an
extraordinary
woman

It

not

''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
opening
the
*NL*
carriage
door
.
``
Good-bye
;
we
do
n't
go
the
same
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
thinking
of
Anna
,
of
everything
,
even
the
simplest
phrase
in
their
*NL*
conversation
with
her
,
and
recalling
the
minutest
changes
in
her
*NL*
expression
,
entering
more
and
more
into
her
position
,
and
feeling
*NL*
sympathy
for
her
,
Levin
reached
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
Kouzma
told
Levin
that
Katerina
Alexandrovna
was
quite
well
,
and
*NL*
that
her
sisters
had
not
long
been
gone
,
and
he
handed
him
two
letters
.
*NL*
Levin
read
them
at
once
in
the
hall
,
that
he
might
not
over
look
them
*NL*
later
.
One
was
from
Sokolov
,
his
bailiff
.
Sokolov
wrote
that
the
corn
*NL*
could
not
be
sold
,
that
it
was
fetching
only
five
and
a
half
roubles
,
*NL*
and
that
more
than
that
could
not
be
got
for
it
.
The
other
letter
was
*NL*
from
his
sister
.
She
scolded
him
for
her
business
being
still
unsettled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
must
sell
it
at
five
and
a
half
if
we
ca
n't
get
more
,
''
Levin
*NL*
decided
the
first
question
,
which
had
always
before
seemed
such
a
*NL*
weighty
one
,
with
extraordinary
facility
on
the
spot
.
``
It
's
*NL*
extraordinary
how
all
one
's
time
is
taken
up
here
,
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
considering
the
second
letter
.
He
felt
himself
to
blame
for
not
having
*NL*
got
done
what
his
sister
had
asked
him
to
do
for
her
.
``
Today
,
again
,
*NL*
I
've
not
been
to
the
court
,
but
today
I
've
certainly
not
had
time
.
''
And
*NL*
resolving
that
he
would
not
fail
to
do
it
next
day
,
he
went
up
to
his
*NL*
wife
.
As
he
went
in
,
Levin
rapidly
ran
through
mentally
the
day
he
had
*NL*
spent
.
All
the
events
of
the
day
were
conversations
,
conversations
he
*NL*
had
heard
and
taken
part
in
.
All
the
conversations
were
upon
subjects
*NL*
which
,
if
he
had
been
alone
at
home
,
he
would
never
have
taken
up
,
but
*NL*
here
they
were
very
interesting
.
And
all
these
conversations
were
right
*NL*
enough
,
only
in
two
places
there
was
something
not
quite
right
.
One
was
*NL*
what
he
had
said
about
the
carp
,
the
other
was
something
not
``
quite
the
*NL*
thing
''
in
the
tender
sympathy
he
was
feeling
for
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
found
his
wife
low-spirited
and
dull
.
The
dinner
of
the
three
*NL*
sisters
had
gone
off
very
well
,
but
then
they
had
waited
and
waited
for
*NL*
him
,
all
of
them
had
felt
dull
,
the
sisters
had
departed
,
and
she
had
*NL*
been
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
have
you
been
doing
?
''
she
asked
him
,
looking
straight
*NL*
into
his
eyes
,
which
shone
with
rather
a
suspicious
brightness
.
But
that
*NL*
she
might
not
prevent
his
telling
her
everything
,
she
concealed
her
*NL*
close
scrutiny
of
him
,
and
with
an
approving
smile
listened
to
his
*NL*
account
of
how
he
had
spent
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
very
glad
I
met
Vronsky
.
I
felt
quite
at
ease
and
natural
*NL*
with
him
.
You
understand
,
I
shall
try
not
to
see
him
,
but
I
'm
glad
that
*NL*
this
awkwardness
is
all
over
,
''
he
said
,
and
remembering
that
by
way
of
*NL*
trying
not
to
see
him
,
he
had
immediately
gone
to
call
on
Anna
,
he
*NL*
blushed
.
``
We
talk
about
the
peasants
drinking
;
I
do
n't
know
which
drinks
*NL*
most
,
the
peasantry
or
our
own
class
;
the
peasants
do
on
holidays
,
*NL*
but
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kitty
took
not
the
slightest
interest
in
discussing
the
drinking
*NL*
habits
of
the
peasants
.
She
saw
that
he
blushed
,
and
she
wanted
to
know
*NL*
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
then
where
did
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiva
urged
me
awfully
to
go
and
see
Anna
Arkadyevna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
said
this
,
Levin
blushed
even
more
,
and
his
doubts
as
to
*NL*
whether
he
had
done
right
in
going
to
see
Anna
were
settled
once
for
*NL*
all
.
He
knew
now
that
he
ought
not
to
have
done
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
eyes
opened
in
a
curious
way
and
gleamed
at
Anna
's
name
,
but
*NL*
controlling
herself
with
an
effort
,
she
concealed
her
emotion
and
*NL*
deceived
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
was
all
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
wo
n't
be
angry
at
my
going
.
Stiva
begged
me
to
,
and
Dolly
*NL*
wished
it
,
''
Levin
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
she
said
,
but
he
saw
in
her
eyes
a
constraint
that
boded
him
*NL*
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
very
sweet
,
very
,
very
unhappy
,
good
woman
,
''
he
said
,
telling
*NL*
her
about
Anna
,
her
occupations
,
and
what
she
had
told
him
to
say
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
she
is
very
much
to
be
pitied
,
''
said
Kitty
,
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
.
``
Whom
was
your
letter
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
,
and
believing
in
her
calm
tone
,
he
went
to
change
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
back
,
he
found
Kitty
in
the
same
easy
chair
.
When
he
went
up
to
*NL*
her
,
she
glanced
at
him
and
broke
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
what
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
knowing
beforehand
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
love
with
that
hateful
woman
;
she
has
bewitched
you
!
I
saw
it
*NL*
in
your
eyes
.
Yes
,
yes
!
What
can
it
all
lead
to
?
You
were
drinking
at
*NL*
the
club
,
drinking
and
gambling
,
and
then
you
went
...
to
her
of
all
*NL*
people
!
No
,
we
must
go
away
...
I
shall
go
away
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
while
before
Levin
could
soothe
his
wife
.
At
last
he
*NL*
succeeded
in
calming
her
,
only
by
confessing
that
a
feeling
of
pity
,
in
*NL*
conjunction
with
the
wine
he
had
drunk
,
had
been
too
much
for
him
,
that
*NL*
he
had
succumbed
to
Anna
's
artful
influence
,
and
that
he
would
avoid
*NL*
her
.
One
thing
he
did
with
more
sincerity
confess
to
was
that
living
so
*NL*
long
in
Moscow
,
a
life
of
nothing
but
conversation
,
eating
and
drinking
,
*NL*
he
was
degenerating
.
They
talked
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
Only
*NL*
at
three
o'clock
were
they
sufficiently
reconciled
to
be
able
to
go
to
*NL*
sleep
.

After
taking
leave
of
her
guests
,
Anna
did
not
sit
down
,
but
began
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
She
had
unconsciously
the
whole
evening
*NL*
done
her
utmost
to
arouse
in
Levin
a
feeling
of
love
--
as
of
late
she
had
*NL*
fallen
into
doing
with
all
young
men
--
and
she
knew
she
had
attained
her
*NL*
aim
,
as
far
as
was
possible
in
one
evening
,
with
a
married
and
*NL*
conscientious
man
.
She
liked
him
indeed
extremely
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
striking
difference
,
from
the
masculine
point
of
view
,
between
Vronsky
*NL*
and
Levin
,
as
a
woman
she
saw
something
they
had
in
common
,
which
had
*NL*
made
Kitty
able
to
love
both
.
Yet
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
room
,
she
*NL*
ceased
to
think
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thought
,
and
one
only
,
pursued
her
in
different
forms
,
and
refused
*NL*
to
be
shaken
off
.
``
If
I
have
so
much
effect
on
others
,
on
this
man
,
who
*NL*
loves
his
home
and
his
wife
,
why
is
it
_
he
_
is
so
cold
to
me
?
...
not
*NL*
cold
exactly
,
he
loves
me
,
I
know
that
!
But
something
new
is
drawing
us
*NL*
apart
now
.
Why
was
n't
he
here
all
the
evening
?
He
told
Stiva
to
say
he
*NL*
could
not
leave
Yashvin
,
and
must
watch
over
his
play
.
Is
Yashvin
a
*NL*
child
?
But
supposing
it
's
true
.
He
never
tells
a
lie
.
But
there
's
*NL*
something
else
in
it
if
it
's
true
.
He
is
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
showing
me
that
he
has
other
duties
;
I
know
that
,
I
submit
to
that
.
But
*NL*
why
prove
that
to
me
?
He
wants
to
show
me
that
his
love
for
me
is
not
to
*NL*
interfere
with
his
freedom
.
But
I
need
no
proofs
,
I
need
love
.
He
ought
*NL*
to
understand
all
the
bitterness
of
this
life
for
me
here
in
Moscow
.
Is
*NL*
this
life
?
I
am
not
living
,
but
waiting
for
an
event
,
which
is
*NL*
continually
put
off
and
put
off
.
No
answer
again
!
And
Stiva
says
he
*NL*
can
not
go
to
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
And
I
ca
n't
write
again
.
I
can
do
*NL*
nothing
,
can
begin
nothing
,
can
alter
nothing
;
I
hold
myself
in
,
I
wait
,
*NL*
inventing
amusements
for
myself
--
the
English
family
,
writing
,
*NL*
reading
--
but
it
's
all
nothing
but
a
sham
,
it
's
all
the
same
as
morphine
.
*NL*
He
ought
to
feel
for
me
,
''
she
said
,
feeling
tears
of
self-pity
coming
*NL*
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
Vronsky
's
abrupt
ring
and
hurriedly
dried
her
tears
--
not
only
*NL*
dried
her
tears
,
but
sat
down
by
a
lamp
and
opened
a
book
,
affecting
*NL*
composure
.
She
wanted
to
show
him
that
she
was
displeased
that
he
had
*NL*
not
come
home
as
he
had
promised
--
displeased
only
,
and
not
on
any
*NL*
account
to
let
him
see
her
distress
,
and
least
of
all
,
her
self-pity
.
*NL*
She
might
pity
herself
,
but
he
must
not
pity
her
.
She
did
not
want
*NL*
strife
,
she
blamed
him
for
wanting
to
quarrel
,
but
unconsciously
put
*NL*
herself
into
an
attitude
of
antagonism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
not
been
dull
?
''
he
said
,
eagerly
and
good-humoredly
,
going
*NL*
up
to
her
.
``
What
a
terrible
passion
it
is
--
gambling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
been
dull
;
I
've
learned
long
ago
not
to
be
dull

Stiva
has
*NL*
been
here
and
Levin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
meant
to
come
and
see
you
.
Well
,
how
did
you
like
Levin
?
''
he
*NL*
said
,
sitting
down
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
.
They
have
not
long
been
gone
.
What
was
Yashvin
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
winning
--
seventeen
thousand

I
got
him
away
.
He
had
really
*NL*
started
home
,
but
he
went
back
again
,
and
now
he
's
losing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
did
you
stay
for
?
''
she
asked
,
suddenly
lifting
her
eyes
to
*NL*
him
.
The
expression
of
her
face
was
cold
and
ungracious
.
``
You
told
Stiva
*NL*
you
were
staying
on
to
get
Yashvin
away
.
And
you
have
left
him
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
expression
of
cold
readiness
for
the
conflict
appeared
on
his
*NL*
face
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
did
not
ask
him
to
give
you
any
message
;
and
*NL*
secondly
,
I
never
tell
lies
.
But
what
's
the
chief
point
,
I
wanted
to
*NL*
stay
,
and
I
stayed
,
''
he
said
,
frowning
.
``
Anna
,
what
is
it
for
,
why
will
*NL*
you
?
''
he
said
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
bending
over
towards
her
,
and
he
*NL*
opened
his
hand
,
hoping
she
would
lay
hers
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
glad
of
this
appeal
for
tenderness
.
But
some
strange
force
of
*NL*
evil
would
not
let
her
give
herself
up
to
her
feelings
,
as
though
the
*NL*
rules
of
warfare
would
not
permit
her
to
surrender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
wanted
to
stay
,
and
you
stayed
.
You
do
everything
you
*NL*
want
to
.
But
what
do
you
tell
me
that
for
?
With
what
object
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
getting
more
and
more
excited
.
``
Does
anyone
contest
your
rights
?
But
you
*NL*
want
to
be
right
,
and
you
're
welcome
to
be
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
closed
,
he
turned
away
,
and
his
face
wore
a
still
more
*NL*
obstinate
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
you
it
's
a
matter
of
obstinacy
,
''
she
said
,
watching
him
intently
*NL*
and
suddenly
finding
the
right
word
for
that
expression
that
irritated
*NL*
her
,
``
simply
obstinacy
.
For
you
it
's
a
question
of
whether
you
keep
the
*NL*
upper
hand
of
me
,
while
for
me
...
''
Again
she
felt
sorry
for
herself
,
*NL*
and
she
almost
burst
into
tears
.
``
If
you
knew
what
it
is
for
me
!
When
I
*NL*
feel
as
I
do
now
that
you
are
hostile
,
yes
,
hostile
to
me
,
if
you
knew
*NL*
what
this
means
for
me
!
If
you
knew
how
I
feel
on
the
brink
of
calamity
*NL*
at
this
instant
,
how
afraid
I
am
of
myself
!
''
And
she
turned
away
,
hiding
*NL*
her
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
you
talking
about
?
''
he
said
,
horrified
at
her
expression
*NL*
of
despair
,
and
again
bending
over
her
,
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
for
?
Do
I
seek
amusements
outside
our
home
?
Do
n't
I
avoid
*NL*
the
society
of
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
!
If
that
were
all
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
what
I
ought
to
do
to
give
you
peace
of
mind
?
I
am
ready
*NL*
to
do
anything
to
make
you
happy
,
''
he
said
,
touched
by
her
expression
of
*NL*
despair
;
``
what
would
n't
I
do
to
save
you
from
distress
of
any
sort
,
as
*NL*
now
,
Anna
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
nothing
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
myself
whether
it
's
the
*NL*
solitary
life
,
my
nerves
...
Come
,
do
n't
let
us
talk
of
it
.
What
about
*NL*
the
race
?
You
have
n't
told
me
!
''
she
inquired
,
trying
to
conceal
her
*NL*
triumph
at
the
victory
,
which
had
anyway
been
on
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
for
supper
,
and
began
telling
her
about
the
races
;
but
in
his
*NL*
tone
,
in
his
eyes
,
which
became
more
and
more
cold
,
she
saw
that
he
did
*NL*
not
forgive
her
for
her
victory
,
that
the
feeling
of
obstinacy
with
*NL*
which
she
had
been
struggling
had
asserted
itself
again
in
him
.
He
was
*NL*
colder
to
her
than
before
,
as
though
he
were
regretting
his
surrender
.
*NL*
And
she
,
remembering
the
words
that
had
given
her
the
victory
,
``
how
I
*NL*
feel
on
the
brink
of
calamity
,
how
afraid
I
am
of
myself
,
''
saw
that
this
*NL*
weapon
was
a
dangerous
one
,
and
that
it
could
not
be
used
a
second
time
.
*NL*
And
she
felt
that
beside
the
love
that
bound
them
together
there
had
*NL*
grown
up
between
them
some
evil
spirit
of
strife
,
which
she
could
not
*NL*
exorcise
from
his
,
and
still
less
from
her
own
heart
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
no
conditions
to
which
a
man
can
not
become
used
,
especially
if
*NL*
he
sees
that
all
around
him
are
living
in
the
same
way
.
Levin
could
not
*NL*
have
believed
three
months
before
that
he
could
have
gone
quietly
to
*NL*
sleep
in
the
condition
in
which
he
was
that
day
,
that
leading
an
*NL*
aimless
,
irrational
life
,
living
too
beyond
his
means
,
after
drinking
to
*NL*
excess
-LRB-
he
could
not
call
what
happened
at
the
club
anything
else
-RRB-
,
*NL*
forming
inappropriately
friendly
relations
with
a
man
with
whom
his
wife
*NL*
had
once
been
in
love
,
and
a
still
more
inappropriate
call
upon
a
woman
*NL*
who
could
only
be
called
a
lost
woman
,
after
being
fascinated
by
that
*NL*
woman
and
causing
his
wife
distress
--
he
could
still
go
quietly
to
sleep
.
*NL*
But
under
the
influence
of
fatigue
,
a
sleepless
night
,
and
the
wine
he
*NL*
had
drunk
,
his
sleep
was
sound
and
untroubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
o'clock
the
creak
of
a
door
opening
waked
him
.
He
jumped
up
and
*NL*
looked
round
.
Kitty
was
not
in
bed
beside
him
.
But
there
was
a
light
*NL*
moving
behind
the
screen
,
and
he
heard
her
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
...
what
is
it
?
''
he
said
,
half-asleep
.
``
Kitty
!
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
she
said
,
coming
from
behind
the
screen
with
a
candle
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
``
I
felt
unwell
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
a
particularly
sweet
and
*NL*
meaning
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
has
it
begun
?
''
he
said
in
terror
.
``
We
ought
to
send
...
''
and
*NL*
hurriedly
he
reached
after
his
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
and
holding
his
hand
.
``
It
's
sure
to
be
*NL*
nothing
.
I
was
rather
unwell
,
only
a
little
.
It
's
all
over
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
getting
into
bed
,
she
blew
out
the
candle
,
lay
down
and
was
still
.
*NL*
Though
he
thought
her
stillness
suspicious
,
as
though
she
were
holding
*NL*
her
breath
,
and
still
more
suspicious
the
expression
of
peculiar
*NL*
tenderness
and
excitement
with
which
,
as
she
came
from
behind
the
*NL*
screen
,
she
said
``
nothing
,
''
he
was
so
sleepy
that
he
fell
asleep
at
*NL*
once
.
Only
later
he
remembered
the
stillness
of
her
breathing
,
and
*NL*
understood
all
that
must
have
been
passing
in
her
sweet
,
precious
heart
*NL*
while
she
lay
beside
him
,
not
stirring
,
in
anticipation
of
the
greatest
*NL*
event
in
a
woman
's
life
.
At
seven
o'clock
he
was
waked
by
the
touch
of
*NL*
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
gentle
whisper
.
She
seemed
struggling
*NL*
between
regret
at
waking
him
,
and
the
desire
to
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
,
do
n't
be
frightened
.
It
's
all
right
.
But
I
fancy
...
We
ought
*NL*
to
send
for
Lizaveta
Petrovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
was
lighted
again
.
She
was
sitting
up
in
bed
,
holding
some
*NL*
knitting
,
which
she
had
been
busy
upon
during
the
last
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
do
n't
be
frightened
,
it
's
all
right
.
I
'm
not
a
bit
afraid
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
seeing
his
scared
face
,
and
she
pressed
his
hand
to
her
bosom
and
*NL*
then
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurriedly
jumped
up
,
hardly
awake
,
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
as
*NL*
he
put
on
his
dressing
gown
;
then
he
stopped
,
still
looking
at
her
.
He
*NL*
had
to
go
,
but
he
could
not
tear
himself
from
her
eyes
.
He
thought
he
*NL*
loved
her
face
,
knew
her
expression
,
her
eyes
,
but
never
had
he
seen
it
*NL*
like
this
.
How
hateful
and
horrible
he
seemed
to
himself
,
thinking
of
*NL*
the
distress
he
had
caused
her
yesterday
.
Her
flushed
face
,
fringed
with
*NL*
soft
curling
hair
under
her
night
cap
,
was
radiant
with
joy
and
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
was
so
little
that
was
complex
or
artificial
in
Kitty
's
*NL*
character
in
general
,
Levin
was
struck
by
what
was
revealed
now
,
when
*NL*
suddenly
all
disguises
were
thrown
off
and
the
very
kernel
of
her
soul
*NL*
shone
in
her
eyes
.
And
in
this
simplicity
and
nakedness
of
her
soul
,
*NL*
she
,
the
very
woman
he
loved
in
her
,
was
more
manifest
than
ever
.
She
*NL*
looked
at
him
,
smiling
;
but
all
at
once
her
brows
twitched
,
she
threw
up
*NL*
her
head
,
and
going
quickly
up
to
him
,
clutched
his
hand
and
pressed
*NL*
close
up
to
him
,
breathing
her
hot
breath
upon
him
.
She
was
in
pain
and
*NL*
was
,
as
it
were
,
complaining
to
him
of
her
suffering
.
And
for
the
first
*NL*
minute
,
from
habit
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
to
blame
.
But
in
her
*NL*
eyes
there
was
a
tenderness
that
told
him
that
she
was
far
from
*NL*
reproaching
him
,
that
she
loved
him
for
her
sufferings
.
``
If
not
I
,
who
*NL*
is
to
blame
for
it
?
''
he
thought
unconsciously
,
seeking
someone
*NL*
responsible
for
this
suffering
for
him
to
punish
;
but
there
was
no
one
*NL*
responsible
.
She
was
suffering
,
complaining
,
and
triumphing
in
her
*NL*
sufferings
,
and
rejoicing
in
them
,
and
loving
them
.
He
saw
that
*NL*
something
sublime
was
being
accomplished
in
her
soul
,
but
what
?
He
could
*NL*
not
make
it
out
.
It
was
beyond
his
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
sent
to
mamma
.
You
go
quickly
to
fetch
Lizaveta
Petrovna
...
*NL*
Kostya
!
...
Nothing
,
it
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
away
from
him
and
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
now
;
Pasha
's
coming
.
I
am
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
saw
with
astonishment
that
she
had
taken
up
the
knitting
she
*NL*
had
brought
in
in
the
night
and
begun
working
at
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Levin
was
going
out
of
one
door
,
he
heard
the
maid-servant
come
in
at
*NL*
the
other
.
He
stood
at
the
door
and
heard
Kitty
giving
exact
directions
*NL*
to
the
maid
,
and
beginning
to
help
her
move
the
bedstead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dressed
,
and
while
they
were
putting
in
his
horses
,
as
a
hired
sledge
*NL*
was
not
to
be
seen
yet
,
he
ran
again
up
to
the
bedroom
,
not
on
tiptoe
,
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
,
but
on
wings
.
Two
maid-servants
were
carefully
moving
*NL*
something
in
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
walking
about
knitting
rapidly
and
giving
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
for
the
doctor
.
They
have
sent
for
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
go
on
there
too
.
Is
n't
there
anything
wanted
?
Yes
,
shall
I
go
to
*NL*
Dolly
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
obviously
not
hearing
what
he
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
Do
go
,
''
she
said
quickly
,
frowning
and
waving
her
hand
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
gone
into
the
drawing
room
,
when
suddenly
a
plaintive
moan
*NL*
sounded
from
the
bedroom
,
smothered
instantly
.
He
stood
still
,
and
for
a
*NL*
long
while
he
could
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
she
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
clutching
at
his
head
he
ran
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
!
pardon
us
!
aid
us
!
''
he
repeated
the
words
that
*NL*
for
some
reason
came
suddenly
to
his
lips
.
And
he
,
an
unbeliever
,
*NL*
repeated
these
words
not
with
his
lips
only
.
At
that
instant
he
knew
*NL*
that
all
his
doubts
,
even
the
impossibility
of
believing
with
his
*NL*
reason
,
of
which
he
was
aware
in
himself
,
did
not
in
the
least
hinder
*NL*
his
turning
to
God
.
All
of
that
now
floated
out
of
his
soul
like
dust
.
*NL*
To
whom
was
he
to
turn
if
not
to
Him
in
whose
hands
he
felt
himself
,
his
*NL*
soul
,
and
his
love
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
was
not
yet
ready
,
but
feeling
a
peculiar
concentration
of
his
*NL*
physical
forces
and
his
intellect
on
what
he
had
to
do
,
he
started
off
*NL*
on
foot
without
waiting
for
the
horse
,
and
told
Kouzma
to
overtake
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
he
met
a
night
cabman
driving
hurriedly
.
In
the
little
*NL*
sledge
,
wrapped
in
a
velvet
cloak
,
sat
Lizaveta
Petrovna
with
a
kerchief
*NL*
round
her
head
.
``
Thank
God
!
thank
God
!
''
he
said
,
overjoyed
to
recognize
*NL*
her
little
fair
face
which
wore
a
peculiarly
serious
,
even
stern
*NL*
expression
.
Telling
the
driver
not
to
stop
,
he
ran
along
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
two
hours
,
then
?
Not
more
?
''
she
inquired
.
``
You
should
let
Pyotr
*NL*
Dmitrievitch
know
,
but
do
n't
hurry
him
.
And
get
some
opium
at
the
*NL*
chemist
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
think
that
it
may
go
on
well
?
Lord
have
mercy
on
us
and
help
*NL*
us
!
''
Levin
said
,
seeing
his
own
horse
driving
out
of
the
gate
.
Jumping
*NL*
into
the
sledge
beside
Kouzma
,
he
told
him
to
drive
to
the
doctor
's
.

*NL*
The
doctor
was
not
yet
up
,
and
the
footman
said
that
``
he
had
been
up
*NL*
late
,
and
had
given
orders
not
to
be
waked
,
but
would
get
up
soon
.
''
The
*NL*
footman
was
cleaning
the
lamp-chimneys
,
and
seemed
very
busy
about
them
.
*NL*
This
concentration
of
the
footman
upon
his
lamps
,
and
his
indifference
*NL*
to
what
was
passing
in
Levin
,
at
first
astounded
him
,
but
immediately
on
*NL*
considering
the
question
he
realized
that
no
one
knew
or
was
bound
to
*NL*
know
his
feelings
,
and
that
it
was
all
the
more
necessary
to
act
calmly
,
*NL*
sensibly
,
and
resolutely
to
get
through
this
wall
of
indifference
and
*NL*
attain
his
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
or
let
anything
slip

''
Levin
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
feeling
a
greater
and
greater
flow
of
physical
energy
and
attention
to
*NL*
all
that
lay
before
him
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ascertained
that
the
doctor
was
not
getting
up
,
Levin
considered
*NL*
various
plans
,
and
decided
on
the
following
one
:
that
Kouzma
should
go
*NL*
for
another
doctor
,
while
he
himself
should
go
to
the
chemist
's
for
*NL*
opium
,
and
if
when
he
came
back
the
doctor
had
not
yet
begun
to
get
up
,
*NL*
he
would
either
by
tipping
the
footman
,
or
by
force
,
wake
the
doctor
at
*NL*
all
hazards
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
chemist
's
the
lank
shopman
sealed
up
a
packet
of
powders
for
a
*NL*
coachman
who
stood
waiting
,
and
refused
him
opium
with
the
same
*NL*
callousness
with
which
the
doctor
's
footman
had
cleaned
his
lamp
*NL*
chimneys
.
Trying
not
to
get
flurried
or
out
of
temper
,
Levin
mentioned
*NL*
the
names
of
the
doctor
and
midwife
,
and
explaining
what
the
opium
was
*NL*
needed
for
,
tried
to
persuade
him
.
The
assistant
inquired
in
German
*NL*
whether
he
should
give
it
,
and
receiving
an
affirmative
reply
from
*NL*
behind
the
partition
,
he
took
out
a
bottle
and
a
funnel
,
deliberately
*NL*
poured
the
opium
from
a
bigger
bottle
into
a
little
one
,
stuck
on
a
*NL*
label
,
sealed
it
up
,
in
spite
of
Levin
's
request
that
he
would
not
do
*NL*
so
,
and
was
about
to
wrap
it
up
too
.
This
was
more
than
Levin
could
*NL*
stand
;
he
took
the
bottle
firmly
out
of
his
hands
,
and
ran
to
the
big
*NL*
glass
doors
.
The
doctor
was
not
even
now
getting
up
,
and
the
footman
,
*NL*
busy
now
in
putting
down
the
rugs
,
refused
to
wake
him
.
Levin
*NL*
deliberately
took
out
a
ten
rouble
note
,
and
,
careful
to
speak
slowly
,
*NL*
though
losing
no
time
over
the
business
,
he
handed
him
the
note
,
and
*NL*
explained
that
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
-LRB-
what
a
great
and
important
personage
*NL*
he
seemed
to
Levin
now
,
this
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
,
who
had
been
of
so
*NL*
little
consequence
in
his
eyes
before
!
-RRB-
had
promised
to
come
at
any
*NL*
time
;
that
he
would
certainly
not
be
angry
!
and
that
he
must
therefore
*NL*
wake
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
agreed
,
and
went
upstairs
,
taking
Levin
into
the
waiting
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
could
hear
through
the
door
the
doctor
coughing
,
moving
about
,
*NL*
washing
,
and
saying
something
.
Three
minutes
passed
;
it
seemed
to
Levin
*NL*
that
more
than
an
hour
had
gone
by
.
He
could
not
wait
any
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
,
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
!
''
he
said
in
an
imploring
voice
*NL*
at
the
open
door
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
forgive
me
!
See
me
as
you
are
.
It
's
*NL*
been
going
on
more
than
two
hours
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
;
in
a
minute
!
''
answered
a
voice
,
and
to
his
amazement
Levin
*NL*
heard
that
the
doctor
was
smiling
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
one
instant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
minutes
more
passed
while
the
doctor
was
putting
on
his
boots
,
and
*NL*
two
minutes
more
while
the
doctor
put
on
his
coat
and
combed
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
!
''
Levin
was
beginning
again
in
a
plaintive
voice
,
*NL*
just
as
the
doctor
came
in
dressed
and
ready
.
``
These
people
have
no
*NL*
conscience
,
''
thought
Levin
.
``
Combing
his
hair
,
while
we
're
dying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
!
''
the
doctor
said
to
him
,
shaking
hands
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
teasing
him
with
his
composure
.
``
There
's
no
hurry
.
Well
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Trying
to
be
as
accurate
as
possible
,
Levin
began
to
tell
him
every
*NL*
unnecessary
detail
of
his
wife
's
condition
,
interrupting
his
account
*NL*
repeatedly
with
entreaties
that
the
doctor
would
come
with
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
be
in
any
hurry
.
You
do
n't
understand
,
you
know
.
I
'm
*NL*
certain
I
'm
not
wanted
,
still
I
've
promised
,
and
if
you
like
,
I
'll
come
.
*NL*
But
there
's
no
hurry
.
Please
sit
down
;
wo
n't
you
have
some
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
stared
at
him
with
eyes
that
asked
whether
he
was
laughing
at
him
;
*NL*
but
the
doctor
had
no
notion
of
making
fun
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
I
know
,
''
the
doctor
said
,
smiling
;
``
I
'm
a
married
man
myself
;
*NL*
and
at
these
moments
we
husbands
are
very
much
to
be
pitied
.
I
've
a
*NL*
patient
whose
husband
always
takes
refuge
in
the
stables
on
such
*NL*
occasions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
think
,
Pyotr
Dmitrievitch
?
Do
you
suppose
it
may
go
all
*NL*
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
points
to
a
favorable
issue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
'll
come
immediately
?
''
said
Levin
,
looking
wrathfully
at
the
*NL*
servant
who
was
bringing
in
the
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
hour
's
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
mercy
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
me
drink
my
coffee
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
started
upon
his
coffee
.
Both
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Turks
are
really
getting
beaten
,
though
.
Did
you
read
yesterday
's
*NL*
telegrams
?
''
said
the
doctor
,
munching
some
roll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
stand
it
!
''
said
Levin
,
jumping
up
.
``
So
you
'll
be
with
us
in
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
honor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
got
home
,
he
drove
up
at
the
same
time
as
the
princess
,
and
*NL*
they
went
up
to
the
bedroom
door
together
.
The
princess
had
tears
in
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
her
hands
were
shaking
.
Seeing
Levin
,
she
embraced
him
,
and
*NL*
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
Lizaveta
Petrovna
?
''
she
queried
,
clasping
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
midwife
,
who
came
out
to
meet
them
with
a
beaming
and
anxious
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
on
well
,
''
she
said
;
``
persuade
her
to
lie
down
.
She
will
be
*NL*
easier
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
moment
when
he
had
waked
up
and
understood
what
was
going
on
,
*NL*
Levin
had
prepared
his
mind
to
bear
resolutely
what
was
before
him
,
and
*NL*
without
considering
or
anticipating
anything
,
to
avoid
upsetting
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
on
the
contrary
to
soothe
her
and
keep
up
her
courage
.
Without
*NL*
allowing
himself
even
to
think
of
what
was
to
come
,
of
how
it
would
end
,
*NL*
judging
from
his
inquiries
as
to
the
usual
duration
of
these
ordeals
,
*NL*
Levin
had
in
his
imagination
braced
himself
to
bear
up
and
to
keep
a
*NL*
tight
rein
on
his
feelings
for
five
hours
,
and
it
had
seemed
to
him
he
*NL*
could
do
this
.
But
when
he
came
back
from
the
doctor
's
and
saw
her
*NL*
sufferings
again
,
he
fell
to
repeating
more
and
more
frequently
:
``
Lord
,
*NL*
have
mercy
on
us
,
and
succor
us
!
''
He
sighed
,
and
flung
his
head
up
,
and
*NL*
began
to
feel
afraid
he
could
not
bear
it
,
that
he
would
burst
into
*NL*
tears
or
run
away
.
Such
agony
it
was
to
him
.
And
only
one
hour
had
*NL*
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
that
hour
there
passed
another
hour
,
two
hours
,
three
,
the
*NL*
full
five
hours
he
had
fixed
as
the
furthest
limit
of
his
sufferings
,
*NL*
and
the
position
was
still
unchanged
;
and
he
was
still
bearing
it
*NL*
because
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
bear
it
;
every
instant
feeling
*NL*
that
he
had
reached
the
utmost
limits
of
his
endurance
,
and
that
his
*NL*
heart
would
break
with
sympathy
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
the
minutes
passed
by
and
the
hours
,
and
still
hours
more
,
and
*NL*
his
misery
and
horror
grew
and
were
more
and
more
intense
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
ordinary
conditions
of
life
,
without
which
one
can
form
no
*NL*
conception
of
anything
,
had
ceased
to
exist
for
Levin
.
He
lost
all
sense
*NL*
of
time
.
Minutes
--
those
minutes
when
she
sent
for
him
and
he
held
her
*NL*
moist
hand
,
that
would
squeeze
his
hand
with
extraordinary
violence
and
*NL*
then
push
it
away
--
seemed
to
him
hours
,
and
hours
seemed
to
him
minutes
.
*NL*
He
was
surprised
when
Lizaveta
Petrovna
asked
him
to
light
a
candle
*NL*
behind
a
screen
,
and
he
found
that
it
was
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
If
he
had
been
told
it
was
only
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
would
not
*NL*
have
been
more
surprised
.
Where
he
was
all
this
time
,
he
knew
as
little
*NL*
as
the
time
of
anything
.
He
saw
her
swollen
face
,
sometimes
bewildered
*NL*
and
in
agony
,
sometimes
smiling
and
trying
to
reassure
him
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
old
princess
too
,
flushed
and
overwrought
,
with
her
gray
curls
in
*NL*
disorder
,
forcing
herself
to
gulp
down
her
tears
,
biting
her
lips
;
he
*NL*
saw
Dolly
too
and
the
doctor
,
smoking
fat
cigarettes
,
and
Lizaveta
*NL*
Petrovna
with
a
firm
,
resolute
,
reassuring
face
,
and
the
old
prince
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
the
hall
with
a
frowning
face
.
But
why
they
came
in
*NL*
and
went
out
,
where
they
were
,
he
did
not
know
.
The
princess
was
with
*NL*
the
doctor
in
the
bedroom
,
then
in
the
study
,
where
a
table
set
for
*NL*
dinner
suddenly
appeared
;
then
she
was
not
there
,
but
Dolly
was
.
Then
*NL*
Levin
remembered
he
had
been
sent
somewhere
.
Once
he
had
been
sent
to
*NL*
move
a
table
and
sofa
.
He
had
done
this
eagerly
,
thinking
it
had
to
be
*NL*
done
for
her
sake
,
and
only
later
on
he
found
it
was
his
own
bed
he
had
*NL*
been
getting
ready
.
Then
he
had
been
sent
to
the
study
to
ask
the
doctor
*NL*
something
.
The
doctor
had
answered
and
then
had
said
something
about
the
*NL*
irregularities
in
the
municipal
council
.
Then
he
had
been
sent
to
the
*NL*
bedroom
to
help
the
old
princess
to
move
the
holy
picture
in
its
silver
*NL*
and
gold
setting
,
and
with
the
princess
's
old
waiting
maid
he
had
*NL*
clambered
on
a
shelf
to
reach
it
and
had
broken
the
little
lamp
,
and
the
*NL*
old
servant
had
tried
to
reassure
him
about
the
lamp
and
about
his
wife
,
*NL*
and
he
carried
the
holy
picture
and
set
it
at
Kitty
's
head
,
carefully
*NL*
tucking
it
in
behind
the
pillow
.
But
where
,
when
,
and
why
all
this
had
*NL*
happened
,
he
could
not
tell
.
He
did
not
understand
why
the
old
princess
*NL*
took
his
hand
,
and
looking
compassionately
at
him
,
begged
him
not
to
*NL*
worry
himself
,
and
Dolly
persuaded
him
to
eat
something
and
led
him
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
even
the
doctor
looked
seriously
and
with
commiseration
*NL*
at
him
and
offered
him
a
drop
of
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
he
knew
and
felt
was
that
what
was
happening
was
what
had
happened
*NL*
nearly
a
year
before
in
the
hotel
of
the
country
town
at
the
deathbed
of
*NL*
his
brother
Nikolay
.
But
that
had
been
grief
--
this
was
joy
.
Yet
that
*NL*
grief
and
this
joy
were
alike
outside
all
the
ordinary
conditions
of
*NL*
life
;
they
were
loop-holes
,
as
it
were
,
in
that
ordinary
life
through
*NL*
which
there
came
glimpses
of
something
sublime
.
And
in
the
contemplation
*NL*
of
this
sublime
something
the
soul
was
exalted
to
inconceivable
heights
*NL*
of
which
it
had
before
had
no
conception
,
while
reason
lagged
behind
,
*NL*
unable
to
keep
up
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
have
mercy
on
us
,
and
succor
us
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
*NL*
incessantly
,
feeling
,
in
spite
of
his
long
and
,
as
it
seemed
,
complete
*NL*
alienation
from
religion
,
that
he
turned
to
God
just
as
trustfully
and
*NL*
simply
as
he
had
in
his
childhood
and
first
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
he
had
two
distinct
spiritual
conditions
.
One
was
away
*NL*
from
her
,
with
the
doctor
,
who
kept
smoking
one
fat
cigarette
after
*NL*
another
and
extinguishing
them
on
the
edge
of
a
full
ash
tray
,
with
*NL*
Dolly
,
and
with
the
old
prince
,
where
there
was
talk
about
dinner
,
about
*NL*
politics
,
about
Marya
Petrovna
's
illness
,
and
where
Levin
suddenly
*NL*
forgot
for
a
minute
what
was
happening
,
and
felt
as
though
he
had
waked
*NL*
up
from
sleep
;
the
other
was
in
her
presence
,
at
her
pillow
,
where
his
*NL*
heart
seemed
breaking
and
still
did
not
break
from
sympathetic
*NL*
suffering
,
and
he
prayed
to
God
without
ceasing
.
And
every
time
he
was
*NL*
brought
back
from
a
moment
of
oblivion
by
a
scream
reaching
him
from
the
*NL*
bedroom
,
he
fell
into
the
same
strange
terror
that
had
come
upon
him
the
*NL*
first
minute
.
Every
time
he
heard
a
shriek
,
he
jumped
up
,
ran
to
justify
*NL*
himself
,
remembered
on
the
way
that
he
was
not
to
blame
,
and
he
longed
*NL*
to
defend
her
,
to
help
her
.
But
as
he
looked
at
her
,
he
saw
again
that
*NL*
help
was
impossible
,
and
he
was
filled
with
terror
and
prayed
:
``
Lord
,
*NL*
have
mercy
on
us
,
and
help
us
!
''
And
as
time
went
on
,
both
these
*NL*
conditions
became
more
intense
;
the
calmer
he
became
away
from
her
,
*NL*
completely
forgetting
her
,
the
more
agonizing
became
both
her
sufferings
*NL*
and
his
feeling
of
helplessness
before
them
.
He
jumped
up
,
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
run
away
,
but
ran
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
again
and
again
she
called
upon
him
,
he
blamed
her
;
but
*NL*
seeing
her
patient
,
smiling
face
,
and
hearing
the
words
,
``
I
am
worrying
*NL*
you
,
''
he
threw
the
blame
on
God
;
but
thinking
of
God
,
at
once
he
fell
to
*NL*
beseeching
God
to
forgive
him
and
have
mercy
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
whether
it
was
late
or
early
.
The
candles
had
all
burned
*NL*
out
.
Dolly
had
just
been
in
the
study
and
had
suggested
to
the
doctor
*NL*
that
he
should
lie
down
.
Levin
sat
listening
to
the
doctor
's
stories
of
*NL*
a
quack
mesmerizer
and
looking
at
the
ashes
of
his
cigarette
.
There
had
*NL*
been
a
period
of
repose
,
and
he
had
sunk
into
oblivion
.
He
had
*NL*
completely
forgotten
what
was
going
on
now
.
He
heard
the
doctor
's
chat
*NL*
and
understood
it
.
Suddenly
there
came
an
unearthly
shriek
.
The
shriek
*NL*
was
so
awful
that
Levin
did
not
even
jump
up
,
but
holding
his
breath
,
*NL*
gazed
in
terrified
inquiry
at
the
doctor
.
The
doctor
put
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
,
listened
,
and
smiled
approvingly
.
Everything
was
so
extraordinary
*NL*
that
nothing
could
strike
Levin
as
strange
.
``
I
suppose
it
must
be
so
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
and
still
sat
where
he
was
.
Whose
scream
was
this
?
He
jumped
*NL*
up
,
ran
on
tiptoe
to
the
bedroom
,
edged
round
Lizaveta
Petrovna
and
the
*NL*
princess
,
and
took
up
his
position
at
Kitty
's
pillow
.
The
scream
had
*NL*
subsided
,
but
there
was
some
change
now
.
What
it
was
he
did
not
see
and
*NL*
did
not
comprehend
,
and
he
had
no
wish
to
see
or
comprehend
.
But
he
saw
*NL*
it
by
the
face
of
Lizaveta
Petrovna
.
Lizaveta
Petrovna
's
face
was
stern
*NL*
and
pale
,
and
still
as
resolute
,
though
her
jaws
were
twitching
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
were
fixed
intently
on
Kitty
.
Kitty
's
swollen
and
agonized
face
,
a
*NL*
tress
of
hair
clinging
to
her
moist
brow
,
was
turned
to
him
and
sought
*NL*
his
eyes
.
Her
lifted
hands
asked
for
his
hands
.
Clutching
his
chill
*NL*
hands
in
her
moist
ones
,
she
began
squeezing
them
to
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
,
do
n't
go
!
I
'm
not
afraid
,
I
'm
not
afraid
!
''
she
said
rapidly
.
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
take
my
earrings
.
They
bother
me
.
You
're
not
afraid
?
Quick
,
*NL*
quick
,
Lizaveta
Petrovna
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
quickly
,
very
quickly
,
and
tried
to
smile
.
But
suddenly
her
*NL*
face
was
drawn
,
she
pushed
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
awful
!
I
'm
dying
,
I
'm
dying
!
Go
away
!
''
she
shrieked
,
and
*NL*
again
he
heard
that
unearthly
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
clutched
at
his
head
and
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
it
's
nothing
,
it
's
all
right
,
''
Dolly
called
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
might
say
what
they
liked
,
he
knew
now
that
all
was
over
.
He
*NL*
stood
in
the
next
room
,
his
head
leaning
against
the
door
post
,
and
*NL*
heard
shrieks
,
howls
such
as
he
had
never
heard
before
,
and
he
knew
that
*NL*
what
had
been
Kitty
was
uttering
these
shrieks
.
He
had
long
ago
ceased
*NL*
to
wish
for
the
child
.
By
now
he
loathed
this
child
.
He
did
not
even
*NL*
wish
for
her
life
now
,
all
he
longed
for
was
the
end
of
this
awful
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
!
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
By
God
!
''
he
said
,
snatching
at
the
*NL*
doctor
's
hand
as
he
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
end
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
And
the
doctor
's
face
was
so
grave
as
*NL*
he
said
it
that
Levin
took
_
the
end
_
as
meaning
her
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
himself
,
he
ran
into
the
bedroom
.
The
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
*NL*
face
of
Lizaveta
Petrovna
.
It
was
even
more
frowning
and
stern
.
Kitty
's
*NL*
face
he
did
not
know
.
In
the
place
where
it
had
been
was
something
that
*NL*
was
fearful
in
its
strained
distortion
and
in
the
sounds
that
came
from
*NL*
it
.
He
fell
down
with
his
head
on
the
wooden
framework
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
feeling
that
his
heart
was
bursting
.
The
awful
scream
never
paused
,
it
*NL*
became
still
more
awful
,
and
as
though
it
had
reached
the
utmost
limit
*NL*
of
terror
,
suddenly
it
ceased
.
Levin
could
not
believe
his
ears
,
but
*NL*
there
could
be
no
doubt
;
the
scream
had
ceased
and
he
heard
a
subdued
*NL*
stir
and
bustle
,
and
hurried
breathing
,
and
her
voice
,
gasping
,
alive
,
*NL*
tender
,
and
blissful
,
uttered
softly
,
``
It
's
over
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
his
head
.
With
her
hands
hanging
exhausted
on
the
quilt
,
*NL*
looking
extraordinarily
lovely
and
serene
,
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
*NL*
and
tried
to
smile
,
and
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
,
from
the
mysterious
and
awful
far-away
world
in
which
he
*NL*
had
been
living
for
the
last
twenty-two
hours
,
Levin
felt
himself
all
in
*NL*
an
instant
borne
back
to
the
old
every-day
world
,
glorified
though
now
,
*NL*
by
such
a
radiance
of
happiness
that
he
could
not
bear
it
.
The
strained
*NL*
chords
snapped
,
sobs
and
tears
of
joy
which
he
had
never
foreseen
rose
*NL*
up
with
such
violence
that
his
whole
body
shook
,
that
for
long
they
*NL*
prevented
him
from
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Falling
on
his
knees
before
the
bed
,
he
held
his
wife
's
hand
before
his
*NL*
lips
and
kissed
it
,
and
the
hand
,
with
a
weak
movement
of
the
fingers
,
*NL*
responded
to
his
kiss
.
And
meanwhile
,
there
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
in
*NL*
the
deft
hands
of
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
like
a
flickering
light
in
a
lamp
,
*NL*
lay
the
life
of
a
human
creature
,
which
had
never
existed
before
,
and
*NL*
which
would
now
with
the
same
right
,
with
the
same
importance
to
itself
,
*NL*
live
and
create
in
its
own
image
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alive
!
alive
!
And
a
boy
too
!
Set
your
mind
at
rest
!
''
Levin
heard
*NL*
Lizaveta
Petrovna
saying
,
as
she
slapped
the
baby
's
back
with
a
shaking
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
is
it
true
?
''
said
Kitty
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
's
sobs
were
all
the
answers
she
could
make
.
And
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
silence
there
came
in
unmistakable
reply
to
the
mother
's
*NL*
question
,
a
voice
quite
unlike
the
subdued
voices
speaking
in
the
room
.
*NL*
It
was
the
bold
,
clamorous
,
self-assertive
squall
of
the
new
human
*NL*
being
,
who
had
so
incomprehensibly
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Levin
had
been
told
before
that
Kitty
was
dead
,
and
that
he
had
died
*NL*
with
her
,
and
that
their
children
were
angels
,
and
that
God
was
standing
*NL*
before
him
,
he
would
have
been
surprised
at
nothing
.
But
now
,
coming
*NL*
back
to
the
world
of
reality
,
he
had
to
make
great
mental
efforts
to
*NL*
take
in
that
she
was
alive
and
well
,
and
that
the
creature
squalling
so
*NL*
desperately
was
his
son
.
Kitty
was
alive
,
her
agony
was
over
.
And
he
was
*NL*
unutterably
happy
.
That
he
understood
;
he
was
completely
happy
in
it
.
*NL*
But
the
baby
?
Whence
,
why
,
who
was
he
?
...
He
could
not
get
used
to
the
*NL*
idea
.
It
seemed
to
him
something
extraneous
,
superfluous
,
to
which
he
*NL*
could
not
accustom
himself
.

Chapter
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
the
old
prince
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
were
sitting
at
Levin
's
.
Having
inquired
after
Kitty
,
they
*NL*
had
dropped
into
conversation
upon
other
subjects
.
Levin
heard
them
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
,
as
they
talked
,
going
over
the
past
,
over
what
had
been
*NL*
up
to
that
morning
,
he
thought
of
himself
as
he
had
been
yesterday
till
*NL*
that
point
.
It
was
as
though
a
hundred
years
had
passed
since
then
.
He
*NL*
felt
himself
exalted
to
unattainable
heights
,
from
which
he
studiously
*NL*
lowered
himself
so
as
not
to
wound
the
people
he
was
talking
to
.
He
*NL*
talked
,
and
was
all
the
time
thinking
of
his
wife
,
of
her
condition
now
,
*NL*
of
his
son
,
in
whose
existence
he
tried
to
school
himself
into
*NL*
believing
.
The
whole
world
of
woman
,
which
had
taken
for
him
since
his
*NL*
marriage
a
new
value
he
had
never
suspected
before
,
was
now
so
exalted
*NL*
that
he
could
not
take
it
in
in
his
imagination
.
He
heard
them
talk
of
*NL*
yesterday
's
dinner
at
the
club
,
and
thought
:
``
What
is
happening
with
her
*NL*
now
?
Is
she
asleep
?
How
is
she
?
What
is
she
thinking
of
?
Is
he
crying
,
*NL*
my
son
Dmitri
?
''
And
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
,
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
a
sentence
,
he
jumped
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
me
word
if
I
can
see
her
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
in
a
minute
,
''
answered
Levin
,
and
without
stopping
,
he
went
*NL*
to
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
asleep
,
she
was
talking
gently
with
her
mother
,
making
plans
*NL*
about
the
christening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carefully
set
to
rights
,
with
hair
well-brushed
,
in
a
smart
little
cap
*NL*
with
some
blue
in
it
,
her
arms
out
on
the
quilt
,
she
was
lying
on
her
*NL*
back
.
Meeting
his
eyes
,
her
eyes
drew
him
to
her
.
Her
face
,
bright
*NL*
before
,
brightened
still
more
as
he
drew
near
her
.
There
was
the
same
*NL*
change
in
it
from
earthly
to
unearthly
that
is
seen
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
dead
.
But
then
it
means
farewell
,
here
it
meant
welcome
.
Again
a
rush
of
*NL*
emotion
,
such
as
he
had
felt
at
the
moment
of
the
child
's
birth
,
flooded
*NL*
his
heart
.
She
took
his
hand
and
asked
him
if
he
had
slept
.
He
could
not
*NL*
answer
,
and
turned
away
,
struggling
with
his
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
nap
,
Kostya
!
''
she
said
to
him
;
``
and
I
am
so
comfortable
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
but
suddenly
her
expression
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
him
to
me
,
''
she
said
,
hearing
the
baby
's
cry
.
``
Give
him
to
me
,
*NL*
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
and
he
shall
look
at
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
his
papa
shall
look
at
him
,
''
said
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
*NL*
getting
up
and
bringing
something
red
,
and
queer
,
and
wriggling
.
``
Wait
a
*NL*
minute
,
we
'll
make
him
tidy
first
,
''
and
Lizaveta
Petrovna
laid
the
red
*NL*
wobbling
thing
on
the
bed
,
began
untrussing
and
trussing
up
the
baby
,
*NL*
lifting
it
up
and
turning
it
over
with
one
finger
and
powdering
it
with
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
looking
at
the
tiny
,
pitiful
creature
,
made
strenuous
efforts
to
*NL*
discover
in
his
heart
some
traces
of
fatherly
feeling
for
it
.
He
felt
*NL*
nothing
towards
it
but
disgust
.
But
when
it
was
undressed
and
he
caught
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
wee
,
wee
,
little
hands
,
little
feet
,
saffron-colored
,
with
*NL*
little
toes
,
too
,
and
positively
with
a
little
big
toe
different
from
*NL*
the
rest
,
and
when
he
saw
Lizaveta
Petrovna
closing
the
wide-open
little
*NL*
hands
,
as
though
they
were
soft
springs
,
and
putting
them
into
linen
*NL*
garments
,
such
pity
for
the
little
creature
came
upon
him
,
and
such
*NL*
terror
that
she
would
hurt
it
,
that
he
held
her
hand
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lizaveta
Petrovna
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
do
n't
be
frightened
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
baby
had
been
put
to
rights
and
transformed
into
a
firm
doll
,
*NL*
Lizaveta
Petrovna
dandled
it
as
though
proud
of
her
handiwork
,
and
stood
*NL*
a
little
away
so
that
Levin
might
see
his
son
in
all
his
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
looked
sideways
in
the
same
direction
,
never
taking
her
eyes
off
*NL*
the
baby
.
``
Give
him
to
me
!
give
him
to
me
!
''
she
said
,
and
even
made
as
*NL*
though
she
would
sit
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
Katerina
Alexandrovna
,
you
must
n't
move
like
*NL*
that
!
Wait
a
minute
.
I
'll
give
him
to
you
.
Here
we
're
showing
papa
what
*NL*
a
fine
fellow
we
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
with
one
hand
supporting
the
wobbling
head
,
*NL*
lifted
up
on
the
other
arm
the
strange
,
limp
,
red
creature
,
whose
head
*NL*
was
lost
in
its
swaddling
clothes
.
But
it
had
a
nose
,
too
,
and
slanting
*NL*
eyes
and
smacking
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
splendid
baby
!
''
said
Lizaveta
Petrovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
sighed
with
mortification
.
This
splendid
baby
excited
in
him
no
*NL*
feeling
but
disgust
and
compassion
.
It
was
not
at
all
the
feeling
he
had
*NL*
looked
forward
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
while
Lizaveta
Petrovna
put
the
baby
to
the
unaccustomed
*NL*
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
laughter
made
him
look
round
.
The
baby
had
taken
the
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
's
enough
,
that
's
enough
!
''
said
Lizaveta
Petrovna
,
but
Kitty
*NL*
would
not
let
the
baby
go
.
He
fell
asleep
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
now
,
''
said
Kitty
,
turning
the
baby
so
that
he
could
see
it
.
The
*NL*
aged-looking
little
face
suddenly
puckered
up
still
more
and
the
baby
*NL*
sneezed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
,
hardly
able
to
restrain
his
tears
,
Levin
kissed
his
wife
and
*NL*
went
out
of
the
dark
room
.
What
he
felt
towards
this
little
creature
was
*NL*
utterly
unlike
what
he
had
expected
.
There
was
nothing
cheerful
and
*NL*
joyous
in
the
feeling
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
was
a
new
torture
of
*NL*
apprehension
.
It
was
the
consciousness
of
a
new
sphere
of
liability
to
*NL*
pain
.
And
this
sense
was
so
painful
at
first
,
the
apprehension
lest
this
*NL*
helpless
creature
should
suffer
was
so
intense
,
that
it
prevented
him
*NL*
from
noticing
the
strange
thrill
of
senseless
joy
and
even
pride
that
he
*NL*
had
felt
when
the
baby
sneezed
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
affairs
were
in
a
very
bad
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
money
for
two-thirds
of
the
forest
had
all
been
spent
already
,
and
*NL*
he
had
borrowed
from
the
merchant
in
advance
at
ten
per
cent
discount
,
*NL*
almost
all
the
remaining
third
.
The
merchant
would
not
give
more
,
*NL*
especially
as
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
for
the
first
time
that
winter
*NL*
insisting
on
her
right
to
her
own
property
,
had
refused
to
sign
the
*NL*
receipt
for
the
payment
of
the
last
third
of
the
forest
.
All
his
salary
*NL*
went
on
household
expenses
and
in
payment
of
petty
debts
that
could
not
*NL*
be
put
off
.
There
was
positively
no
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
unpleasant
and
awkward
,
and
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
opinion
*NL*
things
could
not
go
on
like
this
.
The
explanation
of
the
position
was
,
*NL*
in
his
view
,
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
his
salary
was
too
small
.
The
*NL*
post
he
filled
had
been
unmistakably
very
good
five
years
ago
,
but
it
*NL*
was
so
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Petrov
,
the
bank
director
,
had
twelve
thousand
;
Sventitsky
,
a
company
*NL*
director
,
had
seventeen
thousand
;
Mitin
,
who
had
founded
a
bank
,
*NL*
received
fifty
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clearly
I
've
been
napping
,
and
they
've
overlooked
me
,
''
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
thought
about
himself
.
And
he
began
keeping
his
eyes
and
*NL*
ears
open
,
and
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
he
had
discovered
a
very
*NL*
good
berth
and
had
formed
a
plan
of
attack
upon
it
,
at
first
from
Moscow
*NL*
through
aunts
,
uncles
,
and
friends
,
and
then
,
when
the
matter
was
well
*NL*
advanced
,
in
the
spring
,
he
went
himself
to
Petersburg
.
It
was
one
of
*NL*
those
snug
,
lucrative
berths
of
which
there
are
so
many
more
nowadays
*NL*
than
there
used
to
be
,
with
incomes
ranging
from
one
thousand
to
fifty
*NL*
thousand
roubles
.
It
was
the
post
of
secretary
of
the
committee
of
the
*NL*
amalgamated
agency
of
the
southern
railways
,
and
of
certain
banking
*NL*
companies
.
This
position
,
like
all
such
appointments
,
called
for
such
*NL*
immense
energy
and
such
varied
qualifications
,
that
it
was
difficult
for
*NL*
them
to
be
found
united
in
any
one
man
.
And
since
a
man
combining
all
*NL*
the
qualifications
was
not
to
be
found
,
it
was
at
least
better
that
the
*NL*
post
be
filled
by
an
honest
than
by
a
dishonest
man
.
And
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
was
not
merely
an
honest
man
--
unemphatically
--
in
the
common
*NL*
acceptation
of
the
words
,
he
was
an
honest
man
--
emphatically
--
in
that
*NL*
special
sense
which
the
word
has
in
Moscow
,
when
they
talk
of
an
*NL*
``
honest
''
politician
,
an
``
honest
''
writer
,
an
``
honest
''
newspaper
,
an
*NL*
``
honest
''
institution
,
an
``
honest
''
tendency
,
meaning
not
simply
that
the
*NL*
man
or
the
institution
is
not
dishonest
,
but
that
they
are
capable
on
*NL*
occasion
of
taking
a
line
of
their
own
in
opposition
to
the
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
moved
in
those
circles
in
Moscow
in
which
that
*NL*
expression
had
come
into
use
,
was
regarded
there
as
an
honest
man
,
and
*NL*
so
had
more
right
to
this
appointment
than
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
appointment
yielded
an
income
of
from
seven
to
ten
thousand
a
year
,
*NL*
and
Oblonsky
could
fill
it
without
giving
up
his
government
position
.
It
*NL*
was
in
the
hands
of
two
ministers
,
one
lady
,
and
two
Jews
,
and
all
these
*NL*
people
,
though
the
way
had
been
paved
already
with
them
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
had
to
see
in
Petersburg
.
Besides
this
business
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
had
promised
his
sister
Anna
to
obtain
from
Karenin
a
*NL*
definite
answer
on
the
question
of
divorce
.
And
begging
fifty
roubles
*NL*
from
Dolly
,
he
set
off
for
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
sat
in
Karenin
's
study
listening
to
his
report
on
*NL*
the
causes
of
the
unsatisfactory
position
of
Russian
finance
,
and
only
*NL*
waiting
for
the
moment
when
he
would
finish
to
speak
about
his
own
*NL*
business
or
about
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
very
true
,
''
he
said
,
when
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
took
off
*NL*
the
pince-nez
,
without
which
he
could
not
read
now
,
and
looked
*NL*
inquiringly
at
his
former
brother-in-law
,
``
that
's
very
true
in
*NL*
particular
cases
,
but
still
the
principle
of
our
day
is
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
lay
down
another
principle
,
embracing
the
principle
of
*NL*
freedom
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
with
emphasis
on
the
word
*NL*
``
embracing
,
''
and
he
put
on
his
pince-nez
again
,
so
as
to
read
the
*NL*
passage
in
which
this
statement
was
made
.
And
turning
over
the
*NL*
beautifully
written
,
wide-margined
manuscript
,
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
*NL*
read
aloud
over
again
the
conclusive
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
advocate
protection
for
the
sake
of
private
interests
,
but
for
*NL*
the
public
weal
,
and
for
the
lower
and
upper
classes
equally
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
looking
over
his
pince-nez
at
Oblonsky
.
``
But
_
they
_
can
not
grasp
that
,
*NL*
_
they
_
are
taken
up
now
with
personal
interests
,
and
carried
away
by
*NL*
phrases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
knew
that
when
Karenin
began
to
talk
of
what
_
they
_
*NL*
were
doing
and
thinking
,
the
persons
who
would
not
accept
his
report
and
*NL*
were
the
cause
of
everything
wrong
in
Russia
,
that
it
was
coming
near
*NL*
the
end
.
And
so
now
he
eagerly
abandoned
the
principle
of
free-trade
,
*NL*
and
fully
agreed
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
paused
,
thoughtfully
turning
*NL*
over
the
pages
of
his
manuscript
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
``
I
wanted
to
ask
you
,
some
*NL*
time
when
you
see
Pomorsky
,
to
drop
him
a
hint
that
I
should
be
very
*NL*
glad
to
get
that
new
appointment
of
secretary
of
the
committee
of
the
*NL*
amalgamated
agency
of
the
southern
railways
and
banking
companies
.
''
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
familiar
by
now
with
the
title
of
the
post
he
*NL*
coveted
,
and
he
brought
it
out
rapidly
without
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
questioned
him
as
to
the
duties
of
this
new
*NL*
committee
,
and
pondered
.
He
was
considering
whether
the
new
committee
*NL*
would
not
be
acting
in
some
way
contrary
to
the
views
he
had
been
*NL*
advocating
.
But
as
the
influence
of
the
new
committee
was
of
a
very
*NL*
complex
nature
,
and
his
views
were
of
very
wide
application
,
he
could
*NL*
not
decide
this
straight
off
,
and
taking
off
his
pince-nez
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
can
mention
it
to
him
;
but
what
is
your
reason
precisely
*NL*
for
wishing
to
obtain
the
appointment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
salary
,
rising
to
nine
thousand
,
and
my
means
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nine
thousand
!
''
repeated
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
and
he
frowned
.
The
*NL*
high
figure
of
the
salary
made
him
reflect
that
on
that
side
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
's
proposed
position
ran
counter
to
the
main
tendency
of
his
*NL*
own
projects
of
reform
,
which
always
leaned
towards
economy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
,
and
I
have
embodied
my
views
in
a
note
on
the
subject
,
that
*NL*
in
our
day
these
immense
salaries
are
evidence
of
the
unsound
economic
*NL*
_
assiette
_
of
our
finances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
's
to
be
done
?
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Suppose
a
bank
*NL*
director
gets
ten
thousand
--
well
,
he
's
worth
it
;
or
an
engineer
gets
*NL*
twenty
thousand
--
after
all
,
it
's
a
growing
thing
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assume
that
a
salary
is
the
price
paid
for
a
commodity
,
and
it
ought
*NL*
to
conform
with
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
.
If
the
salary
is
fixed
*NL*
without
any
regard
for
that
law
,
as
,
for
instance
,
when
I
see
two
*NL*
engineers
leaving
college
together
,
both
equally
well
trained
and
*NL*
efficient
,
and
one
getting
forty
thousand
while
the
other
is
satisfied
*NL*
with
two
;
or
when
I
see
lawyers
and
hussars
,
having
no
special
*NL*
qualifications
,
appointed
directors
of
banking
companies
with
immense
*NL*
salaries
,
I
conclude
that
the
salary
is
not
fixed
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
law
of
supply
and
demand
,
but
simply
through
personal
interest
.
And
this
*NL*
is
an
abuse
of
great
gravity
in
itself
,
and
one
that
reacts
injuriously
*NL*
on
the
government
service
.
I
consider
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
made
haste
to
interrupt
his
brother-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
you
must
agree
that
it
's
a
new
institution
of
undoubted
*NL*
utility
that
's
being
started
.
After
all
,
you
know
,
it
's
a
growing
thing
!
*NL*
What
they
lay
particular
stress
on
is
the
thing
being
carried
on
*NL*
honestly
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
with
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Moscow
significance
of
the
word
``
honest
''
was
lost
on
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honesty
is
only
a
negative
qualification
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
do
me
a
great
service
,
anyway
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
``
by
putting
in
a
word
to
Pomorsky
--
just
in
the
way
of
conversation
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
fancy
it
's
more
in
Volgarinov
's
hands
,
''
said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Volgarinov
has
fully
assented
,
as
far
as
he
's
concerned
,
''
said
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
,
turning
red
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
reddened
at
the
mention
*NL*
of
that
name
,
because
he
had
been
that
morning
at
the
Jew
Volgarinov
's
,
*NL*
and
the
visit
had
left
an
unpleasant
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
believed
most
positively
that
the
committee
in
which
*NL*
he
was
trying
to
get
an
appointment
was
a
new
,
genuine
,
and
honest
*NL*
public
body
,
but
that
morning
when
Volgarinov
had
--
intentionally
,
beyond
*NL*
a
doubt
--
kept
him
two
hours
waiting
with
other
petitioners
in
his
*NL*
waiting
room
,
he
had
suddenly
felt
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
he
was
uncomfortable
that
he
,
a
descendant
of
Rurik
,
Prince
*NL*
Oblonsky
,
had
been
kept
for
two
hours
waiting
to
see
a
Jew
,
or
that
for
*NL*
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
not
following
the
example
of
his
*NL*
ancestors
in
serving
the
government
,
but
was
turning
off
into
a
new
*NL*
career
,
anyway
he
was
very
uncomfortable
.
During
those
two
hours
in
*NL*
Volgarinov
's
waiting
room
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
stepping
jauntily
about
*NL*
the
room
,
pulling
his
whiskers
,
entering
into
conversation
with
the
*NL*
other
petitioners
,
and
inventing
an
epigram
on
his
position
,
assiduously
*NL*
concealed
from
others
,
and
even
from
himself
,
the
feeling
he
was
*NL*
experiencing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
the
time
he
was
uncomfortable
and
angry
,
he
could
not
have
said
*NL*
why
--
whether
because
he
could
not
get
his
epigram
just
right
,
or
from
*NL*
some
other
reason
.
When
at
last
Volgarinov
had
received
him
with
*NL*
exaggerated
politeness
and
unmistakable
triumph
at
his
humiliation
,
and
*NL*
had
all
but
refused
the
favor
asked
of
him
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
made
*NL*
haste
to
forget
it
all
as
soon
as
possible
.
And
now
,
at
the
mere
*NL*
recollection
,
he
blushed
.

''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
,
pausing
for
a
brief
space
,
and
*NL*
shaking
off
the
unpleasant
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Oblonsky
uttered
Anna
's
name

the
face
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
was
completely
transformed
;
all
the
life
was
gone
out
of
*NL*
it
,
and
it
looked
weary
and
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

it
exactly

he
said
,
moving
in

snapping
his
pince-nez

*NL*
*NL*
``

going

afraid

his

by

this
,
he
changed
the

Karenin
said
softly

*NL*
*NL*

Alexey

in
a
higher
,
almost
*NL*
shrill
voice

everything

Alexey

refuses

make
it
a

condition
to
leave

son

I
replied
in
that
sense
,

supposed
that
*NL*
the

was
ended

I

it
at

Alexey

Stepan

knee

``
The

If
you

will
allow

to
recapitulate

it
was
like
this
:
when
you
parted

you
*NL*
were
as
magnanimous
as
could
possibly
be
;
you
were
ready
to
give
her

everything

freedom

even
.
She
appreciated
that

No

do
n't

She
did
appreciate
it

to
such
a
degree

at

*NL*
feeling
how
she
had
wronged
you
,
she
did
not
consider
and
could
not
*NL*
consider
everything

She
gave
up
everything

But
experience
,
time

have
*NL*
shown
that
her
position
is
unbearable
,
impossible
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
life
of

Arkadyevna
can
have
no

me

Alexey

Alexandrovitch
put
in
,
lifting
his
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allow

Stepan
Arkadyevitch
replied
gently

Her

said
Stepan

Arkadyevitch
,
touching
his

again

as

feeling
sure
this

would
soften
his

``
All
I

this

Besides

I
had
hoped

Alexey

twitching

his
face
white

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
leaves
it

extricate
her
from
the
impossible
position
in
which
she
is

She
does

Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
you
are
*NL*
a
good
man

Put
yourself
in
her
position
for
a
minute
.
The
question
of
*NL*
divorce
for
her
in
her
position
is
a
question
of
life

death

If
you
*NL*
had
not

it
once
,
she
would
have
reconciled
herself
to
her
*NL*
position

she
would
have
gone
on
living
in
the
country
.
But
you
promised
*NL*
it
,

she
wrote
to
you
,
and
moved
to
Moscow

And
here
she
's
been
for
*NL*
six
months
in
Moscow

where
every
chance
meeting
cuts
her
to
the
heart

every

expecting
an

Why

it
's
like
keeping
a
condemned

criminal
for
six
months
with
the
rope
round
his
neck

promising
him
*NL*
perhaps
death

perhaps
mercy

on

I

arrange
everything

Alexey

Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
about
to
go
away
when
Korney
came
in
to
*NL*
announce
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergey
Alexyevitch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

Sergey

''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
beginning
,
but
he
*NL*
remembered
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Seryozha
!
''
he
said
aloud
.
``
Sergey
Alexyevitch
!
I
thought
it
was
the
*NL*
director
of
a
department
.
Anna
asked
me
to
see
him
too
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
recalled
the
timid
,
piteous
expression
with
which
Anna
had
said
*NL*
to
him
at
parting
:
``
Anyway
,
you
will
see
him

Find
out
exactly
where
he
*NL*
is

who
is
looking
after
him

And
Stiva
...
if
it
were
possible
!
Could
*NL*
it
be
possible
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
knew
what
was
meant
by
that
``
if
it
*NL*
were
possible
,
''
--
if
it
were
possible
to
arrange
the
divorce
so
as
to
let
*NL*
her
have
her
son
...
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
now
that
it
was
no
good
to
*NL*
dream
of
that
,
but
still
he
was
glad
to
see
his
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
reminded
his
brother-in-law
that
they
never
spoke
*NL*
to
the
boy
of
his
mother
,
and
he
begged
him
not
to
mention
a
single
word
*NL*
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
very
ill
after
that
interview
with
his
mother

which
we
had
not
*NL*
foreseen

said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
Indeed
,
we
feared
for
his
life

*NL*
But
with
rational
treatment
,
and
sea-bathing
in
the
summer
,
he
regained
*NL*
his
strength
,
and
now
,
by
the
doctor
's
advice
,
I
have
let
him
go
to
*NL*
school
.
And
certainly
the
companionship
of
school
has
had
a
good
effect
*NL*
on
him
,
and
he
is
perfectly
well
,
and
making
good
progress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fine
fellow
he
's
grown

He
's
not
Seryozha
now
,
but
quite
*NL*
full-fledged
Sergey
Alexyevitch
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
smiling
,
as
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
handsome
,
broad-shouldered
lad
in
blue
coat
and
long
*NL*
trousers
,
who
walked
in
alertly
and
confidently
.
The
boy
looked
healthy
*NL*
and
good-humored
.
He
bowed
to
his
uncle
as
to
a
stranger
,
but
*NL*
recognizing
him
,
he
blushed
and
turned
hurriedly
away
from
him
,
as
*NL*
though
offended
and
irritated
at
something
.
The
boy
went
up
to
his
*NL*
father
and
handed
him
a
note
of
the
marks
he
had
gained
in
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
very
fair
,
''
said
his
father
,
``
you
can
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
thinner
and
taller
,
and
has
grown
out
of
being
a
child
into
a
boy
;
*NL*
I
like
that
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Do
you
remember
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
looked
back
quickly
at
his
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
_
mon
oncle

,
''
he
answered
,
glancing
at
his
father
,
and
again
he
*NL*
looked
downcast
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
uncle
called
him
to
him
,
and
took
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
are
you
getting
on
?
''
he
said
,
wanting
to
talk
to
him
,
and
*NL*
not
knowing
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
blushing
and
making
no
answer
,
cautiously
drew
his
hand
away
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
let
go
his
hand
,
he
glanced
doubtfully
at
*NL*
his
father
,
and
like
a
bird
set
free
,
he
darted
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
year
had
passed
since
the
last
time
Seryozha
had
seen
his
mother
.
*NL*
Since
then
he
had
heard
nothing
more
of
her
.
And
in
the
course
of
that
*NL*
year
he
had
gone
to
school
,
and
made
friends
among
his
schoolfellows
.
*NL*
The
dreams
and
memories
of
his
mother
,
which
had
made
him
ill
after
*NL*
seeing
her
,
did
not
occupy
his
thoughts
now
.
When
they
came
back
to
him
,
*NL*
he
studiously
drove
them
away
,
regarding
them
as
shameful
and
girlish
,
*NL*
below
the
dignity
of
a
boy
and
a
schoolboy
.
He
knew
that
his
father
and
*NL*
mother
were
separated
by
some
quarrel
,
he
knew
that
he
had
to
remain
*NL*
with
his
father
,
and
he
tried
to
get
used
to
that
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
disliked
seeing
his
uncle
,
so
like
his
mother
,
for
it
called
up
those
*NL*
memories
of
which
he
was
ashamed
.
He
disliked
it
all
the
more
as
from
*NL*
some
words
he
had
caught
as
he
waited
at
the
study
door
,
and
still
more
*NL*
from
the
faces
of
his
father
and
uncle
,
he
guessed
that
they
must
have
*NL*
been
talking
of
his
mother
.
And
to
avoid
condemning
the
father
with
whom
*NL*
he
lived
and
on
whom
he
was
dependent
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
avoid
giving
*NL*
way
to
sentimentality
,
which
he
considered
so
degrading
,
Seryozha
tried
*NL*
not
to
look
at
his
uncle
who
had
come
to
disturb
his
peace
of
mind
,
and
*NL*
not
to
think
of
what
he
recalled
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
going
out
after
him
,
saw
him
on
the
*NL*
stairs
,
and
calling
to
him
,
asked
him
how
he
spent
his
playtime
at
*NL*
school
,
Seryozha
talked
more
freely
to
him
away
from
his
father
's
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
a
railway
now
,
''
he
said
in
answer
to
his
uncle
's
question
.
*NL*
``
It
's
like
this
,
do
you
see
:
two
sit
on
a
bench
--
they
're
the
passengers
;
*NL*
and
one
stands
up
straight
on
the
bench
.
And
all
are
harnessed
to
it
by
*NL*
their
arms
or
by
their
belts
,
and
they
run
through
all
the
rooms
--
the
*NL*
doors
are
left
open
beforehand
.
Well
,
and
it
's
pretty
hard
work
being
*NL*
the
conductor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
one
that
stands
?

Stepan
Arkadyevitch
inquired
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
want
pluck
for
it

and
cleverness
too

especially
when
they
*NL*
stop
all
of
a
sudden
,
or
someone
falls
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that
must
be

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
watching
*NL*
with
mournful
interest
the
eager
eyes
,
like
his
mother
's
;
not
childish
*NL*
now
--
no
longer
fully
innocent
.
And
though
he
had
promised
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
not
to
speak
of
Anna
,
he
could
not
restrain
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
your
mother
?
''
he
asked
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
Seryozha
said
quickly
.
He
blushed
crimson
,
and
his
face
*NL*
clouded
over
.
And
his
uncle
could
get
nothing
more
out
of
him
.
His
tutor
*NL*
found
his
pupil
on
the
staircase
half
an
hour
later
,
and
for
a
long
*NL*
while
he
could
not
make
out
whether
he
was
ill-tempered
or
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
I
expect
you
hurt
yourself
when
you
fell
down
?
''
said
the
*NL*
tutor
.
``
I
told
you
it
was
a
dangerous
game
.
And
we
shall
have
to
speak
*NL*
to
the
director
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
hurt
myself
,
nobody
should
have
found
it
out
,
that
's
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
me
alone
!
If
I
remember
,
or
if
I
do
n't
remember
?
...
what
business
*NL*
is
it
of
his
?
Why
should
I
remember
?
Leave
me
in
peace
!

he
said
,
*NL*
addressing
not
his
tutor
,
but
the
whole
world

Chapter
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
usual
,
did
not
waste
his
time
in
Petersburg
.
In
*NL*
Petersburg
,
besides
business
,
his
sister
's
divorce
,
and
his
coveted
*NL*
appointment
,
he
wanted
,
as
he
always
did
,
to
freshen
himself
up
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
after
the
mustiness
of
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
its
_
cafes
chantants
_
and
its
omnibuses
,
Moscow
was
yet
a
*NL*
stagnant
bog
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
always
felt
it
.
After
living
for
some
*NL*
time
in
Moscow
,
especially
in
close
relations
with
his
family
,
he
was
*NL*
conscious
of
a
depression
of
spirits
.
After
being
a
long
time
in
Moscow
*NL*
without
a
change
,
he
reached
a
point
when
he
positively
began
to
be
*NL*
worrying
himself
over
his
wife
's
ill-humor
and
reproaches
,
over
his
*NL*
children
's
health
and
education
,
and
the
petty
details
of
his
official
*NL*
work
;
even
the
fact
of
being
in
debt
worried
him
.
But
he
had
only
to
go
*NL*
and
stay
a
little
while
in
Petersburg
,
in
the
circle
there
in
which
he
*NL*
moved
,
where
people
lived
--
really
lived
--
instead
of
vegetating
as
in
*NL*
Moscow
,
and
all
such
ideas
vanished
and
melted
away
at
once
,
like
wax
*NL*
before
the
fire
.
His
wife
?
...
Only
that
day
he
had
been
talking
to
*NL*
Prince
Tchetchensky
.
Prince
Tchetchensky
had
a
wife
and
family
,
grown-up
*NL*
pages
in
the
corps
,
...
and
he
had
another
illegitimate
family
of
*NL*
children
also
.
Though
the
first
family
was
very
nice
too
,
Prince
*NL*
Tchetchensky
felt
happier
in
his
second
family
;
and
he
used
to
take
his
*NL*
eldest
son
with
him
to
his
second
family
,
and
told
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
*NL*
that
he
thought
it
good
for
his
son
,
enlarging
his
ideas
.
What
would
*NL*
have
been
said
to
that
in
Moscow
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
children
?
In
Petersburg
children
did
not
prevent
their
parents
from
*NL*
enjoying
life
.
The
children
were
brought
up
in
schools
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
trace
of
the
wild
idea
that
prevailed
in
Moscow
,
in
Lvov
's
household
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
that
all
the
luxuries
of
life
were
for
the
children
,
while
*NL*
the
parents
have
nothing
but
work
and
anxiety
.
Here
people
understood
*NL*
that
a
man
is
in
duty
bound
to
live
for
himself
,
as
every
man
of
culture
*NL*
should
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
official
duties
?
Official
work
here
was
not
the
stiff
,
hopeless
*NL*
drudgery
that
it
was
in
Moscow
.
Here
there
was
some
interest
in
official
*NL*
life
.
A
chance
meeting
,
a
service
rendered
,
a
happy
phrase
,
a
knack
of
*NL*
facetious
mimicry
,
and
a
man
's
career
might
be
made
in
a
trice
.
So
it
*NL*
had
been
with
Bryantsev
,
whom
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
met
the
previous
*NL*
day
,
and
who
was
one
of
the
highest
functionaries
in
government
now
.
*NL*
There
was
some
interest
in
official
work
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Petersburg
attitude
on
pecuniary
matters
had
an
especially
soothing
*NL*
effect
on
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
Bartnyansky
,
who
must
spend
at
least
*NL*
fifty
thousand
to
judge
by
the
style
he
lived
in
,
had
made
an
*NL*
interesting
comment
the
day
before
on
that
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
talking
before
dinner
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
said
to
*NL*
Bartnyansky
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
friendly
,
I
fancy
,
with
Mordvinsky
;
you
might
do
me
a
favor
:
say
*NL*
a
word
to
him
,
please
,
for
me
.
There
's
an
appointment
I
should
like
to
*NL*
get
--
secretary
of
the
agency
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
sha
n't
remember
all
that
,
if
you
tell
it
to
me
...
But
what
*NL*
possesses
you
to
have
to
do
with
railways
and
Jews
?
...
Take
it
as
you
*NL*
will
,
it
's
a
low
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
did
not
say
to
Bartnyansky
that
it
was
a
``
growing
*NL*
thing
''
--
Bartnyansky
would
not
have
understood
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
the
money
,
I
've
nothing
to
live
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
living
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
in
debt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
,
though
?
Heavily
?
''
said
Bartnyansky
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
heavily
:
twenty
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bartnyansky
broke
into
good-humored
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
lucky
fellow
!
''
said
he
.
``
My
debts
mount
up
to
a
million
and
a
half
,
*NL*
and
I
've
nothing
,
and
still
I
can
live
,
as
you
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
saw
the
correctness
of
this
view
not
in
words
*NL*
only
but
in
actual
fact
.
Zhivahov
owed
three
hundred
thousand
,
and
*NL*
had
n't
a
farthing
to
bless
himself
with
,
and
he
lived
,
and
in
style
too
!
*NL*
Count
Krivtsov
was
considered
a
hopeless
case
by
everyone
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
kept
two
mistresses
.
Petrovsky
had
run
through
five
millions
,
and
still
*NL*
lived
in
just
the
same
style
,
and
was
even
a
manager
in
the
financial
*NL*
department
with
a
salary
of
twenty
thousand
.
But
besides
this
,
*NL*
Petersburg
had
physically
an
agreeable
effect
on
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
It
*NL*
made
him
younger
.
In
Moscow
he
sometimes
found
a
gray
hair
in
his
head
,
*NL*
dropped
asleep
after
dinner
,
stretched
,
walked
slowly
upstairs
,
*NL*
breathing
heavily
,
was
bored
by
the
society
of
young
women
,
and
did
not
*NL*
dance
at
balls
.
In
Petersburg
he
always
felt
ten
years
younger
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
experience
in
Petersburg
was
exactly
what
had
been
described
to
him
*NL*
on
the
previous
day
by
Prince
Pyotr
Oblonsky
,
a
man
of
sixty
,
who
had
*NL*
just
come
back
from
abroad
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
know
the
way
to
live
here
,
''
said
Pyotr
Oblonsky
.
``
I
spent
the
*NL*
summer
in
Baden
,
and
you
would
n't
believe
it
,
I
felt
quite
a
young
man
.
*NL*
At
a
glimpse
of
a
pretty
woman
,
my
thoughts
...
One
dines
and
drinks
a
*NL*
glass
of
wine
,
and
feels
strong
and
ready
for
anything
.
I
came
home
to
*NL*
Russia
--
had
to
see
my
wife
,
and
,
what
's
more
,
go
to
my
country
place
;
*NL*
and
there
,
you
'd
hardly
believe
it
,
in
a
fortnight
I
'd
got
into
a
*NL*
dressing
gown
and
given
up
dressing
for
dinner
.
Need
n't
say
I
had
no
*NL*
thoughts
left
for
pretty
women
.
I
became
quite
an
old
gentleman
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
think
of
my
eternal
salvation
.
I
went
off
*NL*
to
Paris
--
I
was
as
right
as
could
be
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
felt
exactly
the
difference
that
Pyotr
Oblonsky
*NL*
described
.
In
Moscow
he
degenerated
so
much
that
if
he
had
had
to
be
*NL*
there
for
long
together
,
he
might
in
good
earnest
have
come
to
*NL*
considering
his
salvation
;
in
Petersburg
he
felt
himself
a
man
of
the
*NL*
world
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
Princess
Betsy
Tverskaya
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
there
had
long
*NL*
existed
rather
curious
relations
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
always
flirted
*NL*
with
her
in
jest
,
and
used
to
say
to
her
,
also
in
jest
,
the
most
*NL*
unseemly
things
,
knowing
that
nothing
delighted
her
so
much
.
The
day
*NL*
after
his
conversation
with
Karenin
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
to
see
*NL*
her
,
and
felt
so
youthful
that
in
this
jesting
flirtation
and
nonsense
*NL*
he
recklessly
went
so
far
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
extricate
himself
,
*NL*
as
unluckily
he
was
so
far
from
being
attracted
by
her
that
he
thought
*NL*
her
positively
disagreeable
.
What
made
it
hard
to
change
the
*NL*
conversation
was
the
fact
that
he
was
very
attractive
to
her
.
So
that
he
*NL*
was
considerably
relieved
at
the
arrival
of
Princess
Myakaya
,
which
cut
*NL*
short
their
_
tete-a-tete
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
you
're
here
!
''
said
she
when
she
saw
him
.
``
Well
,
and
what
news
of
*NL*
your
poor
sister
?
You
need
n't
look
at
me
like
that
,
''
she
added
.
``
Ever
*NL*
since
they
've
all
turned
against
her
,
all
those
who
're
a
thousand
times
*NL*
worse
than
she
,
I
've
thought
she
did
a
very
fine
thing
.
I
ca
n't
forgive
*NL*
Vronsky
for
not
letting
me
know
when
she
was
in
Petersburg
.
I
'd
have
*NL*
gone
to
see
her
and
gone
about
with
her
everywhere
.
Please
give
her
my
*NL*
love
.
Come
,
tell
me
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
her
position
is
very
difficult
;
she
...
''
began
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
accepting
as
sterling
coin
Princess
*NL*
Myakaya
's
words
``
tell
me
about
her
.
''
Princess
Myakaya
interrupted
him
*NL*
immediately
,
as
she
always
did
,
and
began
talking
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
done
what
they
all
do
,
except
me
--
only
they
hide
it
.
But
she
*NL*
would
n't
be
deceitful
,
and
she
did
a
fine
thing
.
And
she
did
better
*NL*
still
in
throwing
up
that
crazy
brother-in-law
of
yours
.
You
must
excuse
*NL*
me
.
Everybody
used
to
say
he
was
so
clever
,
so
very
clever
;
I
was
the
*NL*
only
one
that
said
he
was
a
fool
.
Now
that
he
's
so
thick
with
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
and
Landau
,
they
all
say
he
's
crazy
,
and
I
should
prefer
not
to
*NL*
agree
with
everybody
,
but
this
time
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
please
explain
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
;
``
what
does
it
mean
?
*NL*
Yesterday
I
was
seeing
him
on
my
sister
's
behalf
,
and
I
asked
him
to
*NL*
give
me
a
final
answer
.
He
gave
me
no
answer
,
and
said
he
would
think
it
*NL*
over
.
But
this
morning
,
instead
of
an
answer
,
I
received
an
invitation
*NL*
from
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
for
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

so
that
's
it

that
's

said
Princess
Myakaya
gleefully
,
``
they
're

going
to
ask

*NL*
*NL*
``

a

in

in

he
went
to
a

doctor

;
and
in
the
doctor

waiting
room
he
fell
asleep

in

sleep
he
began
giving

Then
the

Yury
Meledinsky

After

dinner

great
deal
of

drunk
at

Bartnyansky
's
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
only
a
little
later
than
the
*NL*
appointed
time
,
went
in
to
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
else
is
with
the
countess
?
--
a
Frenchman
?
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
asked
*NL*
the
hall
porter
,
as
he
glanced
at
the
familiar
overcoat
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
and
a
queer
,
rather
artless-looking
overcoat
with
clasps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
Karenin
and
Count
Bezzubov
,
''
the
porter
answered
*NL*
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Princess
Myakaya
guessed
right
,
''
thought
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
as
he
*NL*
went
upstairs
.
``
Curious
!
It
would
be
quite
as
well
,
though
,
to
get
on
*NL*
friendly
terms
with
her
.
She
has
immense
influence
.
If
she
would
say
a
*NL*
word
to
Pomorsky
,
the
thing
would
be
a
certainty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
quite
light
out-of-doors
,
but
in
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
*NL*
little
drawing
room
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
the
lamps
lighted
.
At
a
*NL*
round
table
under
a
lamp
sat
the
countess
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
talking
softly
.
A
short
,
thinnish
man
,
very
pale
and
handsome
,
with
*NL*
feminine
hips
and
knock-kneed
legs
,
with
fine
brilliant
eyes
and
long
*NL*
hair
lying
on
the
collar
of
his
coat
,
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
room
gazing
at
the
portraits
on
the
wall
.
After
greeting
the
lady
of
the
*NL*
house
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
could
not
resist
*NL*
glancing
once
more
at
the
unknown
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Landau
!
''
the
countess
addressed
him
with
a
softness
and
*NL*
caution
that
impressed
Oblonsky
.
And
she
introduced
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Landau
looked
round
hurriedly
,
came
up
,
and
smiling
,
laid
his
moist
,
*NL*
lifeless
hand
in
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
outstretched
hand
and
immediately
*NL*
walked
away
and
fell
to
gazing
at
the
portraits
again
.
The
countess
and
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
looked
at
each
other
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
,
particularly
today
,
''
said
Countess
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
pointing
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
to
a
seat
beside
Karenin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
introduced
you
to
him
as
Landau
,
''
she
said
in
a
soft
voice
,
glancing
*NL*
at
the
Frenchman
and
again
immediately
after
at
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
*NL*
``
but
he
is
really
Count
Bezzubov
,
as
you
're
probably
aware
.
Only
he
does
*NL*
not
like
the
title
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
heard
so
,
''
answered
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
;
``
they
say
he
completely
*NL*
cured
Countess
Bezzubova
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
here
today
,
poor
thing
!
''
the
countess
said
,
turning
to
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
``
This
separation
is
awful
for
her
.
It
's
such
a
blow
to
*NL*
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
positively
is
going
?
''
queried
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
's
going
to
Paris
.
He
heard
a
voice
yesterday
,
''
said
Countess
*NL*
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
looking
at
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
a
voice
!
''
repeated
Oblonsky
,
feeling
that
he
must
be
as
circumspect
*NL*
as
he
possibly
could
in
this
society
,
where
something
peculiar
was
going
*NL*
on
,
or
was
to
go
on
,
to
which
he
had
not
the
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
's
silence
followed
,
after
which
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
as
*NL*
though
approaching
the
main
topic
of
conversation
,
said
with
a
fine
*NL*
smile
to
Oblonsky
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
you
for
a
long
while
,
and
am
very
glad
to
make
a
closer
*NL*
acquaintance
with
you
.
_
Les
amis
de
nos
amis
sont
nos
amis
.
_
But
to
be
a
*NL*
true
friend
,
one
must
enter
into
the
spiritual
state
of
one
's
friend
,
*NL*
and
I
fear
that
you
are
not
doing
so
in
the
case
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
.
You
understand
what
I
mean
?
''
she
said
,
lifting
her
fine
*NL*
pensive
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
part
,
countess
,
I
understand
the
position
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
...
''
said
Oblonsky
.
Having
no
clear
idea
what
they
were
*NL*
talking
about
,
he
wanted
to
confine
himself
to
generalities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
is
not
in
his
external
position
,
''
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
*NL*
said
sternly
,
following
with
eyes
of
love
the
figure
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
as
he
got
up
and
crossed
over
to
Landau
;
``
his
heart
is
*NL*
changed
,
a
new
heart
has
been
vouchsafed
him
,
and
I
fear
you
do
n't
fully
*NL*
apprehend
the
change
that
has
taken
place
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
in
general
outlines
I
can
conceive
the
change
.
We
have
always
*NL*
been
friendly
,
and
now
...
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
responding
with
a
*NL*
sympathetic
glance
to
the
expression
of
the
countess
,
and
mentally
*NL*
balancing
the
question
with
which
of
the
two
ministers
she
was
most
*NL*
intimate
,
so
as
to
know
about
which
to
ask
her
to
speak
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
that
has
taken
place
in
him
can
not
lessen
his
love
for
his
*NL*
neighbors
;
on
the
contrary
,
that
change
can
only
intensify
love
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
But
I
am
afraid
you
do
not
understand
me
.
Wo
n't
you
have
some
*NL*
tea
?
''
she
said
,
with
her
eyes
indicating
the
footman
,
who
was
handing
*NL*
round
tea
on
a
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
countess
.
Of
course
,
his
misfortune
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
misfortune
which
has
proved
the
highest
happiness
,
when
his
*NL*
heart
was
made
new
,
was
filled
full
of
it
,
''
she
said
,
gazing
with
eyes
*NL*
full
of
love
at
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
believe
I
might
ask
her
to
speak
to
both
of
them
,
''
thought
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
,
countess
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
I
imagine
such
changes
are
a
*NL*
matter
so
private
that
no
one
,
even
the
most
intimate
friend
,
would
care
*NL*
to
speak
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
!
We
ought
to
speak
freely
and
help
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
undoubtedly
so
,
but
there
is
such
a
difference
of
convictions
,
and
*NL*
besides
...
''
said
Oblonsky
with
a
soft
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
difference
where
it
is
a
question
of
holy
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
of
course
;
but
...
''
and
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
paused
in
confusion
.
*NL*
He
understood
at
last
that
they
were
talking
of
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
he
will
fall
asleep
immediately
,
''
said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
in
*NL*
a
whisper
full
of
meaning
,
going
up
to
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
looked
round
.
Landau
was
sitting
at
the
window
,
*NL*
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
the
back
of
his
chair
,
his
head
drooping
.
*NL*
Noticing
that
all
eyes
were
turned
on
him
he
raised
his
head
and
smiled
*NL*
a
smile
of
childlike
artlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
any
notice
,
''
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
and
she
lightly
moved
a
*NL*
chair
up
for
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
.
``
I
have
observed
...
''
she
was
*NL*
beginning
,
when
a
footman
came
into
the
room
with
a
letter
.
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
rapidly
ran
her
eyes
over
the
note
,
and
excusing
herself
,
wrote
*NL*
an
answer
with
extraordinary
rapidity
,
handed
it
to
the
man
,
and
came
*NL*
back
to
the
table
.
``
I
have
observed
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
that
Moscow
people
,
*NL*
especially
the
men
,
are
more
indifferent
to
religion
than
anyone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
countess
,
I
thought
Moscow
people
had
the
reputation
of
being
*NL*
the
firmest
in
the
faith
,
''
answered
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
you
are
unfortunately
one
of
the
*NL*
indifferent
ones
,

said
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
turning
to
him
with
a
*NL*
weary
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
anyone
can
be
indifferent
!
''
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
so
much
indifferent
on
that
subject
as
I
am
waiting
in
*NL*
suspense
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
with
his
most
deprecating
smile
.
``
I
*NL*
hardly
think
that
the
time
for
such
questions
has
come
yet
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
Lidia
Ivanovna
looked
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
never
tell
whether
the
time
has
come
for
us
or
not

said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
severely
.
``
We
ought
not
to
think
whether
we
are
ready
or
*NL*
not
ready

God
's
grace
is
not
guided
by
human
considerations
:
sometimes
*NL*
it
comes
not
to
those
that
strive
for
it
,
and
comes
to
those
that
are
*NL*
unprepared
,
like
Saul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
believe
it
wo
n't
be
just
yet

''
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
who
had
been
*NL*
meanwhile
watching
the
movements
of
the
Frenchman
.
Landau
got
up
and
*NL*
came
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
allow
me
to
listen
?

he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
I
did
not
want
to
disturb
you

said
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
gazing
*NL*
tenderly
at
him
;
``
sit
here
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
has
only
not
to
close
one
's
eyes
to
shut
out
the
light

Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
if
you
knew
the
happiness
we
know
,
feeling
His
presence
ever
in
our
*NL*
hearts

said
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
with
a
rapturous
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
man
may
feel
himself
unworthy
sometimes
to
rise
to
that
height

*NL*
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
conscious
of
hypocrisy
in
admitting
this
*NL*
religious
height
,
but
at
the
same
time
unable
to
bring
himself
to
*NL*
acknowledge
his
free-thinking
views
before
a
person
who
,
by
a
single
*NL*
word
to
Pomorsky
,
might
procure
him
the
coveted
appointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
you
mean
that
sin
keeps
him
back

said
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
``
But
*NL*
that
is
a
false

There

no
sin

their
sin
has
been

atoned
for

Pardon

''
she
added
,
looking
at
the
footman
,
who
came
in
*NL*
again
with
another
letter
.
She
read
it
and
gave
a
verbal
answer
:
*NL*
``
Tomorrow

the
Grand
Duchess

``
For
the

*NL*
she
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

faith

dead

said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
recalling
the
phrase
from
the
catechism
,
and
only
by
his
smile
clinging
*NL*
to
his
independence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you

said
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
addressing
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
with
a
certain
*NL*
reproachfulness
in
his
tone
.
It
was
unmistakably
a
subject
they
had
*NL*
discussed
more
than
once
before
.
``
What
harm
has
been
done
by
the
false

all

*NL*
``
Striving

Countess

Ivanovna

with
disgusted
contempt

``

she
*NL*
added
,
looking
at
Oblonsky
with
the

encouraging
smile
with
which
at
*NL*
court
she
encouraged
youthful
maids
of
honor
,
disconcerted
by
the
new

of
the
court

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
chimed
in
,
with
a
glance
of
approval
at
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``

asked
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
and
receiving
a
*NL*
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
she
got
up
and
began
looking
through
a
shelf
*NL*
of
books

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

she
said

*NL*
looking
inquiringly
at
Karenin

And
finding
the
book
,
and
sitting
down
*NL*
again
in
her
place
,
she
opened
it
.
``
It

very
short

earthly
bliss

you
will
see

She
was
just

settling
herself
to
read

came
in
again

her

in

gazing

fine

pensive

let
him
have
a
chance
to
collect
his
faculties

No

*NL*
``
It

said
Countess
Lidia

,
addressing
*NL*
Landau
;

*NL*
``
Oh

I
shall
understand

''
said
Landau
,
with
the
same
smile
,
and
he
*NL*
closed
his
eyes
.
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
Lidia
Ivanovna
exchanged
*NL*
meaningful
glances
,
and
the
reading
began
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
felt
completely
nonplussed
by
the
strange
talk
which
*NL*
he
was
hearing
for
the
first
time
.
The
complexity
of
Petersburg
,
as
a
*NL*
rule
,
had
a
stimulating
effect
on
him
,
rousing
him
out
of
his
Moscow
*NL*
stagnation
.
But
he
liked
these
complications
,
and
understood
them
only
*NL*
in
the
circles
he
knew
and
was
at
home
in
.
In
these
unfamiliar
*NL*
surroundings
he
was
puzzled
and
disconcerted
,
and
could
not
get
his
*NL*
bearings
.
As
he
listened
to
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
aware
of
the
*NL*
beautiful
,
artless
--
or
perhaps
artful
,
he
could
not
decide
which
--
eyes
*NL*
of
Landau
fixed
upon
him
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
*NL*
peculiar
heaviness
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
incongruous
ideas
were
in
confusion
in
his
head
.
``
Marie
Sanina
*NL*
is
glad
her
child
's
dead
...
How
good
a
smoke
would
be
now
!
...
To
be
*NL*
saved
,
one
need
only
believe
,
and
the
monks
do
n't
know
how
the
thing
's
*NL*
to
be
done
,
but
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
does
know
...
And
why
is
my
head
*NL*
so
heavy
?
Is
it
the
cognac
,
or
all
this
being
so
queer
?
Anyway
,
I
fancy
*NL*
I
've
done
nothing
unsuitable
so
far
.
But
anyway
,
it
wo
n't
do
to
ask
her
*NL*
now
.
They
say
they
make
one
say
one
's
prayers
.
I
only
hope
they
wo
n't
*NL*
make
me
!
That
'll
be
too
imbecile
.
And
what
stuff
it
is
she
's
reading
!
*NL*
but
she
has
a
good
accent
.
Landau
--
Bezzubov

what
's

Bezzubov
for

*NL*
All
at
once
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
became
aware
that
his
lower
jaw
was
*NL*
uncontrollably
forming
a
yawn
.
He
pulled
his
whiskers
to
cover
the
yawn
,
*NL*
and
shook
himself
together
.
But
soon
after
he
became
aware
that
he
was
*NL*
dropping
asleep
and
on
the
very
point
of
snoring
.
He
recovered
himself
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
when
the
voice
of
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
was
saying
*NL*
``
he
's
asleep
.
''
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
started
with
dismay
,
feeling
guilty
*NL*
and
caught
.
But
he
was
reassured
at
once
by
seeing
that
the
words
``
he
's
*NL*
asleep
''
referred
not
to
him
,
but
to
Landau
.
The
Frenchman
was
asleep
as
*NL*
well
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
But
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
being
asleep
*NL*
would
have
offended
them
,
as
he
thought
-LRB-
though
even
this
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
might
not
be
so
,
as
everything
seemed
so
queer
-RRB-
,
while
Landau
's
being
*NL*
asleep
delighted
them
extremely
,
especially
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
``
Mon
ami
,
''
_
said
Lidia
Ivanovna
,
carefully
holding
the
folds
of
her
*NL*
silk
gown
so
as
not
to
rustle
,
and
in
her
excitement
calling
Karenin
not
*NL*
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
but
_
``
mon
ami
,
''
``
donnez-lui
la
main
.
Vous
voyez
?
*NL*
Sh
!
''
_
she
hissed
at
the
footman
as
he
came
in
again
.
``
Not
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frenchman
was
asleep
,
or
pretending
to
be
asleep
,
with
his
head
on
*NL*
the
back
of
his
chair
,
and
his
moist
hand
,
as
it
lay
on
his
knee
,
made
*NL*
faint
movements
,
as
though
trying
to
catch
something
.
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
got
up
,
tried
to
move
carefully
,
but
stumbled
against
the
*NL*
table
,
went
up
and
laid
his
hand
in
the
Frenchman
's
hand
.
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
got
up
too
,
and
opening
his
eyes
wide
,
trying
to
wake
*NL*
himself
up
if
he
were
asleep
,
he
looked
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
*NL*
other
.
It
was
all
real
.
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
felt
that
his
head
was
*NL*
getting
worse
and
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Que
la
personne
qui
est
arrivee
la
derniere
,
celle
qui
demande
,
*NL*
qu'elle

Qu'elle

_
''
articulated
the
Frenchman
,
without
*NL*
opening
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Vous

_
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Qu'elle

repeated
the
Frenchman
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
C'est
moi
,
n'est
-
ce
pas
?
_
''
And
receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
forgetting
the
favor
he
had
meant
to
ask
of
Lidia
*NL*
Ivanovna
,
and
forgetting
his
sister
's
affairs
,
caring
for
nothing
,
but
*NL*
filled
with
the
sole
desire
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
,
went
out
on
*NL*
tiptoe
and
ran
out
into
the
street
as
though
from
a
plague-stricken
*NL*
house
.
For
a
long
while
he
chatted
and
joked
with
his
cab-driver
,
trying
*NL*
to
recover
his
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
French
theater
where
he
arrived
for
the
last
act
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
at
the
Tatar
restaurant
after
his
champagne
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
felt
a
*NL*
little
refreshed
in
the
atmosphere
he
was
used
to
.
But
still
he
felt
*NL*
quite
unlike
himself
all
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
getting
home
to
Pyotr
Oblonsky
's
,
where
he
was
staying
,
Stepan
*NL*
Arkadyevitch
found
a
note
from
Betsy
.
She
wrote
to
him
that
she
was
very
*NL*
anxious
to
finish
their
interrupted
conversation
,
and
begged
him
to
come
*NL*
next
day
.
He
had
scarcely
read
this
note
,
and
frowned
at
its
contents
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
below
the
ponderous
tramp
of
the
servants
,
carrying
*NL*
something
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
went
out
to
look
.
It
was
the
rejuvenated
Pyotr
*NL*
Oblonsky
.
He
was
so
drunk
that
he
could
not
walk
upstairs
;
but
he
told
*NL*
them
to
set
him
on
his
legs
when
he
saw
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
and
*NL*
clinging
to
him
,
walked
with
him
into
his
room
and
there
began
telling
*NL*
him
how
he
had
spent
the
evening
,
and
fell
asleep
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
in
very
low
spirits
,
which
happened
rarely
with
*NL*
him
,
and
for
a
long
while
he
could
not
go
to
sleep
.
Everything
he
could
*NL*
recall
to
his
mind
,
everything
was
disgusting
;
but
most
disgusting
of
*NL*
all
,
as
if
it
were
something
shameful
,
was
the
memory
of
the
evening
he
*NL*
had
spent
at
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
received
from
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
a
final
answer
,
refusing
*NL*
to
grant
Anna
's
divorce
,
and
he
understood
that
this
decision
was
based
*NL*
on
what
the
Frenchman
had
said
in
his
real
or
pretended
trance
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
carry
through
any
undertaking
in
family
life
,
there
must
*NL*
necessarily
be
either
complete
division
between
the
husband
and
wife
,
or
*NL*
loving
agreement
.
When
the
relations
of
a
couple
are
vacillating
and
*NL*
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
,
no
sort
of
enterprise
can
be
*NL*
undertaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
families
remain
for
years
in
the
same
place
,
though
both
husband
*NL*
and
wife
are
sick
of
it
,
simply
because
there
is
neither
complete
*NL*
division
nor
agreement
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Vronsky
and
Anna
felt
life
in
Moscow
insupportable
in
the
heat
and
*NL*
dust
,
when
the
spring
sunshine
was
followed
by
the
glare
of
summer
,
and
*NL*
all
the
trees
in
the
boulevards
had
long
since
been
in
full
leaf
,
and
*NL*
the
leaves
were
covered
with
dust
.
But
they
did
not
go
back
to
*NL*
Vozdvizhenskoe
,
as
they
had
arranged
to
do
long
before
;
they
went
on
*NL*
staying
in
Moscow
,
though
they
both
loathed
it
,
because
of
late
there
*NL*
had
been
no
agreement
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
irritability
that
kept
them
apart
had
no
external
cause
,
and
all
*NL*
efforts
to
come
to
an
understanding
intensified
it
,
instead
of
removing
*NL*
it
.
It
was
an
inner
irritation
,
grounded
in
her
mind
on
the
conviction
*NL*
that
his
love
had
grown
less
;
in
his
,
on
regret
that
he
had
put
himself
*NL*
for
her
sake
in
a
difficult
position
,
which
she
,
instead
of
lightening
,
*NL*
made
still
more
difficult
.
Neither
of
them
gave
full
utterance
to
their
*NL*
sense
of
grievance
,
but
they
considered
each
other
in
the
wrong
,
and
*NL*
tried
on
every
pretext
to
prove
this
to
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
eyes
the
whole
of
him
,
with
all
his
habits
,
ideas
,
desires
,
with
*NL*
all
his
spiritual
and
physical
temperament
,
was
one
thing
--
love
for
*NL*
women
,
and
that
love
,
she
felt
,
ought
to
be
entirely
concentrated
on
her
*NL*
alone
.
That
love
was
less
;
consequently
,
as
she
reasoned
,
he
must
have
*NL*
transferred
part
of
his
love
to
other
women
or
to
another
woman
--
and
she
*NL*
was
jealous
.
She
was
jealous
not
of
any
particular
woman
but
of
the
*NL*
decrease
of
his
love
.
Not
having
got
an
object
for
her
jealousy
,
she
was
*NL*
on
the
lookout
for
it
.
At
the
slightest
hint
she
transferred
her
*NL*
jealousy
from
one
object
to
another
.
At
one
time
she
was
jealous
of
*NL*
those
low
women
with
whom
he
might
so
easily
renew
his
old
bachelor
*NL*
ties
;
then
she
was
jealous
of
the
society
women
he
might
meet
;
then
she
*NL*
was
jealous
of
the
imaginary
girl
whom
he
might
want
to
marry
,
for
whose
*NL*
sake
he
would
break
with
her
.
And
this
last
form
of
jealousy
tortured
*NL*
her
most
of
all
,
especially
as
he
had
unwarily
told
her
,
in
a
moment
of
*NL*
frankness
,
that
his
mother
knew
him
so
little
that
she
had
had
the
*NL*
audacity
to
try
and
persuade
him
to
marry
the
young
Princess
Sorokina
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
being
jealous
of
him
,
Anna
was
indignant
against
him
and
found
*NL*
grounds
for
indignation
in
everything
.
For
everything
that
was
difficult
*NL*
in
her
position
she
blamed
him
.
The
agonizing
condition
of
suspense
she
*NL*
had
passed
in
Moscow
,
the
tardiness
and
indecision
of
Alexey
*NL*
Alexandrovitch
,
her
solitude
--
she
put
it
all
down
to
him
.
If
he
had
*NL*
loved
her
he
would
have
seen
all
the
bitterness
of
her
position
,
and
*NL*
would
have
rescued
her
from
it
.
For
her
being
in
Moscow
and
not
in
the
*NL*
country
,
he
was
to
blame
too
.
He
could
not
live
buried
in
the
country
as
*NL*
she
would
have
liked
to
do
.
He
must
have
society
,
and
he
had
put
her
in
*NL*
this
awful
position
,
the
bitterness
of
which
he
would
not
see
.
And
*NL*
again
,
it
was
his
fault
that
she
was
forever
separated
from
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
rare
moments
of
tenderness
that
came
from
time
to
time
did
not
*NL*
soothe
her
;
in
his
tenderness
now
she
saw
a
shade
of
complacency
,
of
*NL*
self-confidence
,
which
had
not
been
of
old
,
and
which
exasperated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dusk
.
Anna
was
alone
,
and
waiting
for
him
to
come
back
from
a
*NL*
bachelor
dinner
.
She
walked
up
and
down
in
his
study
-LRB-
the
room
where
the
*NL*
noise
from
the
street
was
least
heard
-RRB-
,
and
thought
over
every
detail
of
*NL*
their
yesterday
's
quarrel
.
Going
back
from
the
well-remembered
,
*NL*
offensive
words
of
the
quarrel
to
what
had
been
the
ground
of
it
,
she
*NL*
arrived
at
last
at
its
origin
.
For
a
long
while
she
could
hardly
believe
*NL*
that
their
dissension
had
arisen
from
a
conversation
so
inoffensive
,
of
*NL*
so
little
moment
to
either
.
But
so
it
actually
had
been
.
It
all
arose
*NL*
from
his
laughing
at
the
girls
'
high
schools
,
declaring
they
were
*NL*
useless
,
while
she
defended
them
.
He
had
spoken
slightingly
of
women
's
*NL*
education
in
general
,
and
had
said
that
Hannah
,
Anna
's
English
protegee
,
*NL*
had
not
the
slightest
need
to
know
anything
of
physics
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
irritated
Anna
.
She
saw
in
this
a
contemptuous
reference
to
her
*NL*
occupations
.
And
she
bethought
her
of
a
phrase
to
pay
him
back
for
the
*NL*
pain
he
had
given
her
.
``
I
do
n't
expect
you
to
understand
me
,
my
*NL*
feelings
,
as
anyone
who
loved
me
might
,
but
simple
delicacy
I
did
*NL*
expect
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
actually
flushed
with
vexation
,
and
had
said
something
*NL*
unpleasant
.
She
could
not
recall
her
answer
,
but
at
that
point
,
with
an
*NL*
unmistakable
desire
to
wound
her
too
,
he
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
no
interest
in
your
infatuation
over
this
girl
,
that
's
true
,
*NL*
because
I
see
it
's
unnatural
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cruelty
with
which
he
shattered
the
world
she
had
built
up
for
*NL*
herself
so
laboriously
to
enable
her
to
endure
her
hard
life
,
the
*NL*
injustice
with
which
he
had
accused
her
of
affectation
,
of
*NL*
artificiality
,
aroused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
that
nothing
but
what
's
coarse
and
material
is
*NL*
comprehensible
and
natural
to
you
,
''
she
said
and
walked
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
come
in
to
her
yesterday
evening
,
they
had
not
referred
to
*NL*
the
quarrel
,
but
both
felt
that
the
quarrel
had
been
smoothed
over
,
but
*NL*
was
not
at
an

*NL*
*NL*
Today
he
had
not
been
at
home
all
day
,
and
she
felt
so
lonely
and
*NL*
wretched
in
being
on
bad
terms
with
him
that
she
wanted
to
forget
it
*NL*
all
,
to
forgive
him
,
and
be
reconciled
with
him
;
she
wanted
to
throw
the
*NL*
blame
on
herself
and
to
justify
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
myself
to
blame
.
I
'm
irritable
,
I
'm
insanely
jealous
.
I
will
make
*NL*
it
up
with
him
,
and
we
'll
go
away
to
the
country
;
there
I
shall
be
more
*NL*
at
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unnatural
!
''
She
suddenly
recalled
the
word
that
had
stung
her
most
of
*NL*
all
,
not
so
much
the
word
itself
as
the
intent
to
wound
her
with
which
*NL*
it
was
said
.
``
I
know
what
he
meant
;
he
meant
--
unnatural
,
not
loving
my
*NL*
own
daughter
,
to
love
another
person
's
child
.
What
does
he
know
of
love
*NL*
for
children
,
of
my
love
for
Seryozha
,
whom
I
've
sacrificed
for
him
?
But
*NL*
that
wish
to
wound
me
!
No
,
he
loves
another
woman
,
it
must
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
perceiving
that
,
while
trying
to
regain
her
peace
of
mind
,
she
had
*NL*
gone
round
the
same
circle
that
she
had
been
round
so
often
before
,
and
*NL*
had
come
back
to
her
former
state
of
exasperation
,
she
was
horrified
at
*NL*
herself
.
``
Can
it
be
impossible
?
Can
it
be
beyond
me
to
control
myself
?
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
,
and
began
again
from
the
beginning
.
``
He
's
truthful
,
*NL*
he
's
honest
,
he
loves
me
.
I
love
him
,
and
in
a
few
days
the
divorce
will
*NL*
come
.
What
more
do
I
want
?
I
want
peace
of
mind
and
trust
,
and
I
will
*NL*
take
the
blame
on
myself
.
Yes
,
now
when
he
comes
in
,
I
will
tell
him
I
*NL*
was
wrong
,
though
I
was
not
wrong
,
and
we
will
go
away
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
escape
thinking
any
more
,
and
being
overcome
by
irritability
,
she
*NL*
rang
,
and
ordered
the
boxes
to
be
brought
up
for
packing
their
things
*NL*
for
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Vronsky
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
was
it
nice
?
''
she
asked
,
coming
out
to
meet
him
with
a
penitent
*NL*
and
meek
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
usual
,
''
he
answered
,
seeing
at
a
glance
that
she
was
in
one
of
*NL*
her
good
moods
.
He
was
used
by
now
to
these
transitions
,
and
he
was
*NL*
particularly
glad
to
see
it
today
,
as
he
was
in
a
specially
good
humor
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
see
?
Come
,
that
's
good
!
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
boxes
in
*NL*
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
must
go
.
I
went
out
for
a
drive
,
and
it
was
so
fine
I
longed
to
*NL*
be
in
the
country
.
There
's
nothing
to
keep
you
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
one
thing
I
desire
.
I
'll
be
back
directly
,
and
we
'll
talk
it
*NL*
over
;
I
only
want
to
change
my
coat
.
Order
some
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
into
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
mortifying
in
the
way
he
had
said
``
Come
,
that
's
*NL*
good
,
''
as
one
says
to
a
child
when
it
leaves
off
being
naughty
,
and
*NL*
still
more
mortifying
was
the
contrast
between
her
penitent
and
his
*NL*
self-confident
tone
;
and
for
one
instant
she
felt
the
lust
of
strife
*NL*
rising
up
in
her
again
,
but
making
an
effort
she
conquered
it
,
and
met
*NL*
Vronsky
as
good-humoredly
as
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
in
she
told
him
,
partly
repeating
phrases
she
had
prepared
*NL*
beforehand
,
how
she
had
spent
the
day
,
and
her
plans
for
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
came
to
me
almost
like
an
inspiration
,
''
she
said
.
``
Why
wait
*NL*
here
for
the
divorce
?
Wo
n't
it
be
just
the
same
in
the
country
?
I
ca
n't
*NL*
wait
any
longer
!
I
do
n't
want
to
go
on
hoping
,
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
*NL*
anything
about
the
divorce
.
I
have
made
up
my
mind
it
shall
not
have
any
*NL*
more
influence
on
my
life
.
Do
you
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
he
said
,
glancing
uneasily
at
her
excited
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
do
?
Who
was
there
?
''
she
said
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
mentioned
the
names
of
the
guests
.
``
The
dinner
was
first
rate
,
*NL*
and
the
boat
race
,
and
it
was
all
pleasant
enough
,
but
in
Moscow
they
*NL*
can
never
do
anything
without
something
_
ridicule
_
.
A
lady
of
a
sort
*NL*
appeared
on
the
scene
,
teacher
of
swimming
to
the
Queen
of
Sweden
,
and
*NL*
gave
us
an
exhibition
of
her
skill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
did
she
swim
?
''
asked
Anna
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
an
absurd
red
_
costume
de
natation
;
_
she
was
old
and
hideous
too
.
So
*NL*
when
shall
we
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
an
absurd
fancy
!
Why
,
did
she
swim
in
some
special
way
,
then
?
''
*NL*
said
Anna
,
not
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
absolutely
nothing
in
it
.
That
's
just
what
I
say
,
it
was
*NL*
awfully
stupid
.
Well
,
then
,
when
do
you
think
of
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
shook
her
head
as
though
trying
to
drive
away
some
unpleasant
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
Why
,
the
sooner
the
better
!
By
tomorrow
we
sha
n't
be
ready
.
The
*NL*
day
after
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
oh
,
no
,
wait
a
minute
!
The
day
after
tomorrow
's
Sunday
,
I
have
*NL*
to
be
at
maman
's
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
embarrassed
,
because
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
uttered
his
mother
's
name
he
was
aware
of
her
intent
,
suspicious
eyes
.
*NL*
His
embarrassment
confirmed
her
suspicion
.
She
flushed
hotly
and
drew
*NL*
away
from
him
.
It
was
now
not
the
Queen
of
Sweden
's
swimming-mistress
*NL*
who
filled
Anna
's
imagination
,
but
the
young
Princess
Sorokina
.
She
was
*NL*
staying
in
a
village
near
Moscow
with
Countess
Vronskaya
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
go
tomorrow
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
!
The
deeds
and
the
money
for
the
business
I
'm
going
there
for
*NL*
I
ca
n't
get
by
tomorrow
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
so
,
we
wo
n't
go
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
go
later
.
Monday
or
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
said
Vronsky
,
as
though
in
amazement
.
``
Why
,
there
's
no
*NL*
meaning
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
meaning
in
it
to
you
,
because
you
care
nothing
for
me
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
care
to
understand
my
life
.
The
one
thing
that
I
cared
for
here
*NL*
was
Hannah
.
You
say
it
's
affectation
.
Why
,
you
said
yesterday
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
love
my
daughter
,
that
I
love
this
English
girl
,
that
it
's
*NL*
unnatural
.
I
should
like
to
know
what
life
there
is
for
me
that
could
be
*NL*
natural
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
she
had
a
clear
vision
of
what
she
was
doing
,
and
was
*NL*
horrified
at
how
she
had
fallen
away
from
her
resolution
.
But
even
*NL*
though
she
knew
it
was
her
own
ruin
,
she
could
not
restrain
herself
,
*NL*
could
not
keep
herself
from
proving
to
him
that
he
was
wrong
,
could
not
*NL*
give
way
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
said
that
;
I
said
I
did
not
sympathize
with
this
sudden
*NL*
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
,
though
you
boast
of
your
straightforwardness
,
you
do
n't
tell
*NL*
the
truth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
boast
,
and
I
never
tell
lies
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
restraining
his
*NL*
rising
anger
.
``
It
's
a
great
pity
if
you
ca
n't
respect
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Respect
was
invented
to
cover
the
empty
place
where
love
should
be
.
And
*NL*
if
you
do
n't
love
me
any
more
,
it
would
be
better
and
more
honest
to
say
*NL*
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
this
is
becoming
unbearable
!
''
cried
Vronsky
,
getting
up
from
his
*NL*
chair
;
and
stopping
short
,
facing
her
,
he
said
,
speaking
deliberately
:
*NL*
``
What
do
you
try
my
patience
for
?
''
looking
as
though
he
might
have
said
*NL*
much
more
,
but
was
restraining
himself
.
``
It
has
limits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
she
cried
,
looking
with
terror
at
the
*NL*
undisguised
hatred
in
his
whole
face
,
and
especially
in
his
cruel
,
*NL*
menacing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
...
''
he
was
beginning
,
but
he
checked
himself
.
``
I
must
ask
*NL*
what
it
is
you
want
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
want
?
All
I
can
want
is
that
you
should
not
desert
me
,
as
*NL*
you
think
of
doing
,
''
she
said
,
understanding
all
he
had
not
uttered
.
*NL*
``
But
that
I
do
n't
want
;
that
's
secondary
.
I
want
love
,
and
there
is
*NL*
none
.
So
then
all
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
sto-op
!
''
said
Vronsky
,
with
no
change
in
the
gloomy
lines
of
his
*NL*
brows
,
though
he
held
her
by
the
hand
.
``
What
is
it
all
about
?
I
said
*NL*
that
we
must
put
off
going
for
three
days
,
and
on
that
you
told
me
I
was
*NL*
lying
,
that
I
was
not
an
honorable
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
repeat
that
the
man
who
reproaches
me
with
having
sacrificed
*NL*
everything
for
me
,
''
she
said
,
recalling
the
words
of
a
still
earlier
*NL*
quarrel
,
``
that
he
's
worse
than
a
dishonorable
man
--
he
's
a
heartless
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
are
limits
to
endurance
!
''
he
cried
,
and
hastily
let
go
her
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
hates
me
,
that
's
clear
,
''
she
thought
,
and
in
silence
,
without
*NL*
looking
round
,
she
walked
with
faltering
steps
out
of
the
room
.
``
He
*NL*
loves
another
woman
,
that
's
even
clearer
,
''
she
said
to
herself
as
she
*NL*
went
into
her
own
room
.
``
I
want
love
,
and
there
is
none
.
So
,
then
,
all
*NL*
is
over
.
''
She
repeated
the
words
she
had
said
,
``
and
it
must
be
ended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
?
''
she
asked
herself
,
and
she
sat
down
in
a
low
chair
before
the
*NL*
looking
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughts
of
where
she
would
go
now
,
whether
to
the
aunt
who
had
brought
*NL*
her
up
,
to
Dolly
,
or
simply
alone
abroad
,
and
of
what
_
he
_
was
doing
now
*NL*
alone
in
his
study
;
whether
this
was
the
final
quarrel
,
or
whether
*NL*
reconciliation
were
still
possible
;
and
of
what
all
her
old
friends
at
*NL*
Petersburg
would
say
of
her
now
;
and
of
how
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
would
*NL*
look
at
it
,
and
many
other
ideas
of
what
would
happen
now
after
this
*NL*
rupture
,
came
into
her
head
;
but
she
did
not
give
herself
up
to
them
*NL*
with
all
her
heart
.
At
the
bottom
of
her
heart
was
some
obscure
idea
*NL*
that
alone
interested
her
,
but
she
could
not
get
clear
sight
of
it
.
*NL*
Thinking
once
more
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
she
recalled
the
time
of
*NL*
her
illness
after
her
confinement
,
and
the
feeling
which
never
left
her
*NL*
at
that
time
.
``
Why
did
n't
I
die
?
''
and
the
words
and
the
feeling
of
that
*NL*
time
came
back
to
her
.
And
all
at
once
she
knew
what
was
in
her
soul
.
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
that
idea
which
alone
solved
all
.
``
Yes
,
to
die
!
...
And
the
*NL*
shame
and
disgrace
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
and
of
Seryozha
,
and
my
*NL*
awful
shame
,
it
will
all
be
saved
by
death
.
To
die
!
and
he
will
feel
*NL*
remorse
;
will
be
sorry
;
will
love
me
;
he
will
suffer
on
my
account
.
''
*NL*
With
the
trace
of
a
smile
of
commiseration
for
herself
she
sat
down
in
*NL*
the
armchair
,
taking
off
and
putting
on
the
rings
on
her
left
hand
,
*NL*
vividly
picturing
from
different
sides
his
feelings
after
her
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Approaching
footsteps
--
his
steps
--
distracted
her
attention
.
As
though
*NL*
absorbed
in
the
arrangement
of
her
rings
,
she
did
not
even
turn
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
her
,
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
said
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
we
'll
go
the
day
after
tomorrow
,
if
you
like
.
I
agree
to
*NL*
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
she
said
,
and
at
the
same
instant
,
unable
to
restrain
*NL*
herself
any
longer
,
she
burst
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cast
me

!
''
she
articulated
between
her
sobs
.
``
I
'll
go
away
tomorrow
*NL*
...
I
'll
do
more
.
What
am
I
?
An
immoral
woman
!
A
stone
round
your
neck
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
make
you
wretched
,
I
do
n't
want
to
!
I
'll
set
you
free
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
love
me
;
you
love
someone
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
besought
her
to
be
calm
,
and
declared
that
there
was
no
trace
of
*NL*
foundation
for
her
jealousy
;
that
he
had
never
ceased
,
and
never
would
*NL*
cease
,
to
love
her
;
that
he
loved
her
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
why
distress
yourself
and
me
so
?
''
he
said
to
her
,
kissing
her
*NL*
hands
.
There
was
tenderness
now
in
his
face
,
and
she
fancied
she
caught
*NL*
the
sound
of
tears
in
his
voice
,
and
she
felt
them
wet
on
her
hand
.
And
*NL*
instantly
Anna
's
despairing
jealousy
changed
to
a
despairing
passion
of
*NL*
tenderness
.
She
put
her
arms
round
him
,
and
covered
with
kisses
his
*NL*
head
,
his
neck
,
his
hands
.

*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
the
reconciliation
was
complete
,
Anna
set
eagerly
to
work
*NL*
in
the
morning
preparing
for
their
departure
.
Though
it
was
not
settled
*NL*
whether
they
should
go
on
Monday
or
Tuesday
,
as
they
had
each
given
way
*NL*
to
the
other
,
Anna
packed
busily
,
feeling
absolutely
indifferent
whether
*NL*
they
went
a
day
earlier
or
later
.
She
was
standing
in
her
room
over
an
*NL*
open
box
,
taking
things
out
of
it
,
when
he
came
in
to
see
her
earlier
*NL*
than
usual
,
dressed
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
off
at
once
to
see
maman
;
she
can
send
me
the
money
by
*NL*
Yegorov
.
And
I
shall
be
ready
to
go
tomorrow
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
was
in
such
a
good
mood
,
the
thought
of
his
visit
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
gave
her
a
pang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
be
ready
by
then
myself
,
''
she
said
;
and
at
once
reflected
,
*NL*
``
so
then
it
was
possible
to
arrange
to
do
as
I
wished
.
''
``
No
,
do
as
you
*NL*
meant
to
do
.
Go
into
the
dining
room
,
I
'm
coming
directly
.
It
's
only
to
*NL*
turn
out
those
things
that
are
n't
wanted
,
''
she
said
,
putting
something
*NL*
more
on
the
heap
of
frippery
that
lay
in
Annushka
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
eating
his
beefsteak
when
she
came
into
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
believe
how
distasteful
these
rooms
have
become
to
me
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
sitting
down
beside
him
to
her
coffee
.
``
There
's
nothing
more
*NL*
awful
than
these
_
chambres
garnies
_
.
There
's
no
individuality
in
them

*NL*
no
soul
.
These
clocks
,
and
curtains
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
the
*NL*
wallpapers
--
they
're
a
nightmare
.
I
think
of
Vozdvizhenskoe
as
the
*NL*
promised
land
.
You
're
not
sending
the
horses
off
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
will
come
after
us
.
Where
are
you
going
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
go
to
Wilson
's
to
take
some
dresses
to
her
.
So
it
's
really
*NL*
to
be
tomorrow
?
''
she
said
in
a
cheerful
voice
;
but
suddenly
her
face
*NL*
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
's
valet
came
in
to
ask
him
to
sign
a
receipt
for
a
telegram
from
*NL*
Petersburg
.
There
was
nothing
out
of
the
way
in
Vronsky
's
getting
a
*NL*
telegram
,
but
he
said
,
as
though
anxious
to
conceal
something
from
her
,
*NL*
that
the
receipt
was
in
his
study
,
and
he
turned
hurriedly
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
tomorrow
,
without
fail
,
I
will
finish
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
whom
is
the
telegram
?
''
she
asked
,
not
hearing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Stiva
,
''
he
answered
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
show
it
to
me
?
What
secret
can
there
be
between
Stiva
*NL*
and
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
called
the
valet
back
,
and
told
him
to
bring
the
telegram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
show
it
to
you
,
because
Stiva
has
such
a
passion
for
*NL*
telegraphing
:
why
telegraph
when
nothing
is
settled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
divorce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
he
says
he
has
not
been
able
to
come
at
anything
yet
.
He
has
*NL*
promised
a
decisive
answer
in
a
day
or
two
.
But
here
it
is
;
read
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
trembling
hands
Anna
took
the
telegram
,
and
read
what
Vronsky
had
*NL*
told
her
.
At
the
end
was
added
:
``
Little
hope
;
but
I
will
do
everything
*NL*
possible
and
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
yesterday
that
it
's
absolutely
nothing
to
me
when
I
get

or
*NL*
whether
I
never
get
,
a
divorce
,
''
she
said
,
flushing
crimson
.
``
There
was
*NL*
not
the
slightest
necessity
to
hide
it
from
me
.
''
``
So
he
may
hide
and
*NL*
does
hide
his
correspondence
with
women
from
me
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yashvin
meant
to
come
this
morning
with
Voytov
,
''
said
Vronsky
;
``
I
*NL*
believe
he
's
won
from
Pyevtsov
all
and
more
than
he
can
pay
,
about
sixty
*NL*
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
irritated
by
his
so
obviously
showing
by
this
change
of
*NL*
subject
that
he
was
irritated
,
``
why
did
you
suppose
that
this
news
would
*NL*
affect
me
so
,
that
you
must
even
try
to
hide
it
?
I
said
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
consider
it
,
and
I
should
have
liked
you
to
care
as
little
about
it
as
I
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
care
about
it
because
I
like
definiteness
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Definiteness
is
not
in
the
form
but
the
love
,
''
she
said
,
more
and
more
*NL*
irritated
,
not
by
his
words
,
but
by
the
tone
of
cool
composure
in
which
*NL*
he
spoke
.
``
What
do
you
want
it
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
love
again
,
''
he
thought
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
what
for
;
for
your
sake
and
your
children
's
in
the
*NL*
future

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
wo
n't
be
children
in
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
great
pity
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
it
for
the
children
's
sake
,
but
you
do
n't
think
of
me
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
quite
forgetting
or
not
having
heard
that
he
had
said
,
''
_
for
your
*NL*
sake
_
and
the
children
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
of
the
possibility
of
having
children
had
long
been
a
*NL*
subject
of
dispute
and
irritation
to
her
.
His
desire
to
have
children
*NL*
she
interpreted
as
a
proof
he
did
not
prize
her
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
said
:
for
your
sake
.
Above
all
for
your
sake
,
''
he
repeated
,
*NL*
frowning
as
though
in
pain
,
``
because
I
am
certain
that
the
greater
part
*NL*
of
your
irritability
comes
from
the
indefiniteness
of
the
position

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
he
has
laid
aside
all
pretense
,
and
all
his
cold
hatred
for
me
*NL*
is
apparent

''
she
thought
,
not
hearing
his
words
,
but
watching
with
*NL*
terror
the
cold
,
cruel
judge
who
looked
mocking
her
out
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cause
is
not
that
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
,
indeed
,
I
do
n't
see
how
the
*NL*
cause
of
my
irritability
,
as
you
call
it
,
can
be
that
I
am
completely
in
*NL*
your
power
.
What
indefiniteness
is
there
in
the
position
?
on
the
*NL*
contrary
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
that
you
do
n't
care
to
understand
,
''
he
interrupted
,
*NL*
obstinately
anxious
to
give
utterance
to
his
thought
.
``
The
*NL*
indefiniteness
consists
in
your
imagining
that
I
am
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
that
score
you
can
set
your
mind
quite
at
rest

''
she
said
,
and
*NL*
turning
away
from
him
,
she
began
drinking
her
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
her
cup
,
with
her
little
finger
held
apart
,
and
put
it
to
her
*NL*
lips
.
After
drinking
a
few
sips
she
glanced
at
him
,
and
by
his
*NL*
expression
,
she
saw
clearly
that
he
was
repelled
by
her
hand
,
and
her
*NL*
gesture
,
and
the
sound
made
by
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
in
the

what
your

match
she

wants

for
you

she
said
,
putting
the
cup
down
with
a
shaking
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

are
not
talking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

just
what

are
talking
about

me
tell
you
that
a
*NL*
heartless
woman
,
whether
she
's
old
or
not
old
,
your
mother
or
anyone
*NL*
else

is
of
no
consequence
to

I
would
not
consent
to
know
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
I
beg
you
not
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
my
request

will
not

disrespectfully

he
said
,
raising
his
voice
and
looking
sternly
*NL*
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
Looking
intently
at
him
,
at
his
face
,
his
hands
,
she
*NL*
recalled
all
the
details
of
their
reconciliation
the
previous
day
,
and
*NL*
his
passionate
caresses
.
``
There

just
such
caresses
he
has
lavished

*NL*
will
lavish

she
thought

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
love

That
's
all
talk

she
*NL*
said
,
looking
at
him
with
hatred
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
so
,
you
must
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
decide
,
and
I
have
decided

''
she
said
,
and
she
would
have
gone
*NL*
away
,
but
at
that
moment
Yashvin
walked
into
the
room
.
Anna
greeted
him
*NL*
and
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
,
when
there
was
a
tempest
in
her
soul
,
and
she
felt
she
was
standing
*NL*
at
a
turning
point
in
her
life
,
which
might
have
fearful
*NL*
consequences
--
why
,
at
that
minute
,
she
had
to
keep
up
appearances
before
*NL*
an
outsider
,
who
sooner
or
later
must
know
it
all
--
she
did
not
know
.
But
*NL*
at
once
quelling
the
storm
within
her
,
she
sat
down
and
began
talking
to
*NL*
their
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
you
getting
on
?
Has
your
debt
been
paid
you
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
Yashvin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pretty
fair
;
I
fancy
I
sha
n't
get
it
all
,
but
I
shall
get
a
good
*NL*
half
.
And
when
are
you
off
?
''
said
Yashvin
,
looking
at
Vronsky
,
and
*NL*
unmistakably
guessing
at
a
quarrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
after
tomorrow
,
I
think
,
''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
meaning
to
go
so
long
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
it
's
quite
decided
,
''
said
Anna
,
looking
Vronsky
straight
in
the
*NL*
face
with
a
look
which
told
him
not
to
dream
of
the
possibility
of
*NL*
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
feel
sorry
for
that
unlucky
Pyevtsov
?
''
she
went
on
,
talking
*NL*
to
Yashvin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
asked
myself
the
question
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
,
whether
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
for
him
or
not
.
You
see
,
all
my
fortune
's
here

--
he
touched
his
*NL*
breast
pocket
--
``
and
just
now
I
'm
a
wealthy
man

But
today
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
the
club
,
and
I
may
come
out
a
beggar
.
You
see
,
whoever
sits
down
to
*NL*
play
with
me
--
he
wants
to
leave
me
without
a
shirt
to
my
back
,
and
so
do
*NL*
I
him
.
And
so
we
fight
it
out
,
and
that
's
the
pleasure
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
suppose
you
were
married
,
''
said
Anna
,
``
how
would
it
be
for
*NL*
your
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yashvin
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
I
'm
not
married

and
never
mean
to
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Helsingfors
?
''
said
Vronsky
,
entering
into
the
conversation
and
*NL*
glancing
at
Anna
's
smiling
face
.
Meeting
his
eyes
,
Anna
's
face
instantly
*NL*
took
a
coldly
severe
expression
as
though
she
were
saying
to
him
:
``
It
's
*NL*
not
forgotten
.
It
's
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
really
in
love

she
said
to
Yashvin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
heavens
!
ever
so
many
times
!
But
you
see
,
some
men
can
play
but
only
*NL*
so
that
they
can
always
lay
down
their
cards
when
the
hour
of
a
*NL*
_
rendezvous
_
comes
,
while
I
can
take
up
love
,
but
only
so
as
not
to
be
*NL*
late
for
my
cards
in
the
evening

That
's
how
I
manage
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

did
n't
mean
that
,
but
the
real
thing
.
''
She
would
have
said
*NL*
_
Helsingfors
_
,
but
would
not
repeat
the
word
used
by
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Voytov
,
who
was
buying
the
horse
,
came
in
.
Anna
got
up
and
went
out
of
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
leaving
the
house
,
Vronsky
went
into
her
room
.
She
would
have
*NL*
pretended
to
be
looking
for
something
on
the
table
,
but
ashamed
of
*NL*
making
a
pretense
,
she
looked
straight
in
his
face
with
cold
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
asked
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
the
guarantee
for
Gambetta
,
I
've
sold
him
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
said
more
clearly
than
words
,
``
I
've
no
time
for
discussing
things
,
*NL*
and
it
would
lead
to
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
to
blame
in
any
way
,
''
he
thought
.
``
If
she
will
punish
herself
,
*NL*
_
tant
pis
pour
elle
.
_
''
But
as
he
was
going
he
fancied
that
she
said
*NL*
something
,
and
his
heart
suddenly
ached
with
pity
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Anna
?
''
he
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
nothing
,
''
she
answered
just
as
coldly
and
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
_
tant
pis
_
then
,
''
he
thought
,
feeling
cold
again
,
and
he
*NL*
turned
and
went
out
.
As
he
was
going
out
he
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
*NL*
looking
glass
of
her
face
,
white
,
with
quivering
lips
.
He
even
wanted
to
*NL*
stop
and
to
say
some
comforting
word
to
her
,
but
his
legs
carried
him
*NL*
out
of
the
room
before
he
could
think
what
to
say
.
The
whole
of
that
day
*NL*
he
spent
away
from
home
,
and
when
he
came
in
late
in
the
evening
the
*NL*
maid
told
him
that
Anna
Arkadyevna
had
a
headache
and
begged
him
not
to
*NL*
go
in
to
her
.

Chapter
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Never
before
had
a
day
been
passed
in
quarrel
.
Today
was
the
first
time
.
*NL*
And
this
was
not
a
quarrel
.
It
was
the
open
acknowledgment
of
complete
*NL*
coldness
.
Was
it
possible
to
glance
at
her
as
he
had
glanced
when
he
*NL*
came
into
the
room
for
the
guarantee
?
--
to
look
at
her
,
see
her
heart
was
*NL*
breaking
with
despair
,
and
go
out
without
a
word
with
that
face
of
*NL*
callous
composure
?
He
was
not
merely
cold
to
her
,
he
hated
her
because
*NL*
he
loved
another
woman
--
that
was
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
remembering
all
the
cruel
words
he
had
said
,
Anna
supplied
,
too
,
the
*NL*
words
that
he
had
unmistakably
wished
to
say
and
could
have
said
to
her
,
*NL*
and
she
grew
more
and
more
exasperated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
prevent
you
,
''
he
might
say
.
``
You
can
go
where
you
like
.
You
*NL*
were
unwilling
to
be
divorced
from
your
husband
,
no
doubt
so
that
you
*NL*
might
go
back
to
him
.
Go
back
to
him
.
If
you
want
money
,
I
'll
give
it
to
*NL*
you
.
How
many
roubles
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
most
cruel
words
that
a
brutal
man
could
say
,
he
said
to
her
in
*NL*
her
imagination
,
and
she
could
not
forgive
him
for
them
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
actually
said
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
n't
he
only
yesterday
swear
he
loved
me
,
he
,
a
truthful
and
*NL*
sincere
man
?
Have
n't
I
despaired
for
nothing
many
times
already
?
''
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
,
except
for
the
visit
to
Wilson
's
,
which
occupied
two
*NL*
hours
,
Anna
spent
in
doubts
whether
everything
were
over
or
whether
*NL*
there
were
still
hope
of
reconciliation
,
whether
she
should
go
away
at
*NL*
once
or
see
him
once
more
.
She
was
expecting
him
the
whole
day
,
and
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
as
she
went
to
her
own
room
,
leaving
a
message
for
him
that
*NL*
her
head
ached
,
she
said
to
herself
,
``
If
he
comes
in
spite
of
what
the
*NL*
maid
says
,
it
means
that
he
loves
me
still
.
If
not
,
it
means
that
all
is
*NL*
over
,
and
then
I
will
decide
what
I
'm
to
do
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
she
heard
the
rumbling
of
his
carriage
stop
at
the
*NL*
entrance
,
his
ring
,
his
steps
and
his
conversation
with
the
servant
;
he
*NL*
believed
what
was
told
him
,
did
not
care
to
find
out
more
,
and
went
to
*NL*
his
own
room
.
So
then
everything
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
death
rose
clearly
and
vividly
before
her
mind
as
the
sole
means
of
*NL*
bringing
back
love
for
her
in
his
heart
,
of
punishing
him
and
of
gaining
*NL*
the
victory
in
that
strife
which
the
evil
spirit
in
possession
of
her
*NL*
heart
was
waging
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
nothing
mattered
:
going
or
not
going
to
Vozdvizhenskoe
,
getting
or
*NL*
not
getting
a
divorce
from
her
husband
--
all
that
did
not
matter
.
The
one
*NL*
thing
that
mattered
was
punishing
him
.
When
she
poured
herself
out
her
*NL*
usual
dose
of
opium
,
and
thought
that
she
had
only
to
drink
off
the
*NL*
whole
bottle
to
die
,
it
seemed
to
her
so
simple
and
easy
,
that
she
began
*NL*
musing
with
enjoyment
on
how
he
would
suffer
,
and
repent
and
love
her
*NL*
memory
when
it
would
be
too
late
.
She
lay
in
bed
with
open
eyes
,
by
the
*NL*
light
of
a
single
burned-down
candle
,
gazing
at
the
carved
cornice
of
*NL*
the
ceiling
and
at
the
shadow
of
the
screen
that
covered
part
of
it
,
*NL*
while
she
vividly
pictured
to
herself
how
he
would
feel
when
she
would
*NL*
be
no
more
,
when
she
would
be
only
a
memory
to
him
.
``
How
could
I
say
*NL*
such
cruel
things
to
her
?
''
he
would
say
.
``
How
could
I
go
out
of
the
room
*NL*
without
saying
anything
to
her
?
But
now
she
is
no
more
.
She
has
gone
*NL*
away
from
us
forever
.
She
is
...
''
Suddenly
the
shadow
of
the
screen
*NL*
wavered
,
pounced
on
the
whole
cornice
,
the
whole
ceiling
;
other
shadows
*NL*
from
the
other
side
swooped
to
meet
it
,
for
an
instant
the
shadows
*NL*
flitted
back
,
but
then
with
fresh
swiftness
they
darted
forward
,
*NL*
wavered
,
commingled
,
and
all
was
darkness
.
``
Death
!
''
she
thought
.
And
*NL*
such
horror
came
upon
her
that
for
a
long
while
she
could
not
realize
*NL*
where
she
was
,
and
for
a
long
while
her
trembling
hands
could
not
find
*NL*
the
matches
and
light
another
candle
,
instead
of
the
one
that
had
burned
*NL*
down
and
gone
out
.
``
No
,
anything
--
only
to
live
!
Why
,
I
love
him
!
Why
,
he
*NL*
loves
me
!
This
has
been
before
and
will
pass
,
''
she
said
,
feeling
that
*NL*
tears
of
joy
at
the
return
to
life
were
trickling
down
her
cheeks
.
And
*NL*
to
escape
from
her
panic
she
went
hurriedly
to
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
asleep
there
,
and
sleeping
soundly
.
She
went
up
to
him
,
and
*NL*
holding
the
light
above
his
face
,
she
gazed
a
long
while
at
him
.
Now
*NL*
when
he
was
asleep
,
she
loved
him
so
that
at
the
sight
of
him
she
could
*NL*
not
keep
back
tears
of
tenderness
.
But
she
knew
that
if
he
waked
up
he
*NL*
would
look
at
her
with
cold
eyes
,
convinced
that
he
was
right
,
and
that
*NL*
before
telling
him
of
her
love
,
she
would
have
to
prove
to
him
that
he
*NL*
had
been
wrong
in
his
treatment
of
her
.
Without
waking
him
,
she
went
*NL*
back
,
and
after
a
second
dose
of
opium
she
fell
towards
morning
into
a
*NL*
heavy
,
incomplete
sleep
,
during
which
she
never
quite
lost
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
she
was
waked
by
a
horrible
nightmare
,
which
had
recurred
*NL*
several
times
in
her
dreams
,
even
before
her
connection
with
Vronsky
.
A
*NL*
little
old
man
with
unkempt
beard
was
doing
something
bent
down
over
*NL*
some
iron
,
muttering
meaningless
French
words
,
and
she
,
as
she
always
*NL*
did
in
this
nightmare
-LRB-
it
was
what
made
the
horror
of
it
-RRB-
,
felt
that
*NL*
this
peasant
was
taking
no
notice
of
her
,
but
was
doing
something
*NL*
horrible
with
the
iron
--
over
her
.
And
she
waked
up
in
a
cold
sweat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
up
,
the
previous
day
came
back
to
her
as
though
veiled
in
*NL*
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
a
quarrel
.
Just
what
has
happened
several
times
.
I
said
I
had
*NL*
a
headache
,
and
he
did
not
come
in
to
see
me
.
Tomorrow
we
're
going
away
;
*NL*
I
must
see
him
and
get
ready
for
the
journey
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
And
*NL*
learning
that
he
was
in
his
study
,
she
went
down
to
him
.
As
she
passed
*NL*
through
the
drawing
room
she
heard
a
carriage
stop
at
the
entrance
,
and
*NL*
looking
out
of
the
window
she
saw
the
carriage
,
from
which
a
young
girl
*NL*
in
a
lilac
hat
was
leaning
out
giving
some
direction
to
the
footman
*NL*
ringing
the
bell
.
After
a
parley
in
the
hall
,
someone
came
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
Vronsky
's
steps
could
be
heard
passing
the
drawing
room
.
He
went
rapidly
*NL*
downstairs
.
Anna
went
again
to
the
window
.
She
saw
him
come
out
onto
the
*NL*
steps
without
his
hat
and
go
up
to
the
carriage
.
The
young
girl
in
the
*NL*
lilac
hat
handed
him
a
parcel
.
Vronsky
,
smiling
,
said
something
to
her
.
*NL*
The
carriage
drove
away
,
he
ran
rapidly
upstairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mists
that
had
shrouded
everything
in
her
soul
parted
suddenly
.
The
*NL*
feelings
of
yesterday
pierced
the
sick
heart
with
a
fresh
pang
.
She
*NL*
could
not
understand
now
how
she
could
have
lowered
herself
by
spending
*NL*
a
whole
day
with
him
in
his
house
.
She
went
into
his
room
to
announce
*NL*
her
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
Madame
Sorokina
and
her
daughter
.
They
came
and
brought
me
the
*NL*
money
and
the
deeds
from
maman
.
I
could
n't
get
them
yesterday
.
How
is
*NL*
your
head
,
better
?
''
he
said
quietly
,
not
wishing
to
see
and
to
*NL*
understand
the
gloomy
and
solemn
expression
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
silently
,
intently
at
him
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
.
He
glanced
at
her
,
frowned
for
a
moment
,
and
went
on
reading
a
*NL*
letter
.
She
turned
,
and
went
deliberately
out
of
the
room
.
He
still
*NL*
might
have
turned
her
back
,
but
she
had
reached
the
door
,
he
was
still
*NL*
silent
,
and
the
only
sound
audible
was
the
rustling
of
the
note
paper
as
*NL*
he
turned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
the
way
,
''
he
said
at
the
very
moment
she
was
in
the
doorway
,
*NL*
``
we
're
going
tomorrow
for
certain
,
are
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
but
not
I
,
''
she
said
,
turning
round
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anna
,
we
ca
n't
go
on
like
this
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
but
not
I
,
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
getting
unbearable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
...
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
,
''
she
said
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frightened
by
the
desperate
expression
with
which
these
words
were
*NL*
uttered
,
he
jumped
up
and
would
have
run
after
her
,
but
on
second
*NL*
thoughts
he
sat
down
and
scowled
,
setting
his
teeth
.
This
vulgar
--
as
he
*NL*
thought
it
--
threat
of
something
vague
exasperated
him
.
``
I
've
tried
*NL*
everything
,
''
he
thought
;
``
the
only
thing
left
is
not
to
pay
attention
,
''
*NL*
and
he
began
to
get
ready
to
drive
into
town
,
and
again
to
his
mother
's
*NL*
to
get
her
signature
to
the
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
the
sound
of
his
steps
about
the
study
and
the
dining
room
.
At
*NL*
the
drawing
room
he
stood
still
.
But
he
did
not
turn
in
to
see
her
,
he
*NL*
merely
gave
an
order
that
the
horse
should
be
given
to
Voytov
if
he
came
*NL*
while
he
was
away
.
Then
she
heard
the
carriage
brought
round
,
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
he
came
out
again
.
But
he
went
back
into
the
porch
again
,
*NL*
and
someone
was
running
upstairs
.
It
was
the
valet
running
up
for
his
*NL*
gloves
that
had
been
forgotten
.
She
went
to
the
window
and
saw
him
take
*NL*
the
gloves
without
looking
,
and
touching
the
coachman
on
the
back
he
*NL*
said
something
to
him
.
Then
without
looking
up
at
the
window
he
settled
*NL*
himself
in
his
usual
attitude
in
the
carriage
,
with
his
legs
crossed
,
*NL*
and
drawing
on
his
gloves
he
vanished
round
the
corner
.

``
He
has
gone
!
It
is
over
!
''
Anna
said
to
herself
,
standing
at
the
window
;
*NL*
and
in
answer
to
this
statement
the
impression
of
the
darkness
when
the
*NL*
candle
had
flickered
out
,
and
of
her
fearful
dream
mingling
into
one
,
*NL*
filled
her
heart
with
cold
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
that
can
not
be
!
''
she
cried
,
and
crossing
the
room
she
rang
the
*NL*
bell
.
She
was
so
afraid
now
of
being
alone
,
that
without
waiting
for
the
*NL*
servant
to
come
in
,
she
went
out
to
meet
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Inquire
where
the
count
has
gone
,
''
she
said
.
The
servant
answered
that
*NL*
the
count
had
gone
to
the
stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
honor
left
word
that
if
you
cared
to
drive
out

the

would
*NL*
be
back
immediately

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

Wait
a

I
'll
write

Mihail
with

note
to

haste

*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
and
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
wrong
.
Come
back
home

I
must
explain

For
God
's
sake
come
!
I
'm
*NL*
afraid

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sealed
it
up
and
gave
it
to
the
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
afraid
of
being
left
alone
now
;
she
followed
the
servant
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
and
went
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
this
is
n't
it
,
this
is
n't
he
!
Where
are
his
blue
eyes
,
his
sweet
,
*NL*
shy
smile
?
''
was
her
first
thought
when
she
saw
her
chubby
,
rosy
little
*NL*
girl
with
her
black
,
curly
hair
instead
of
Seryozha
,
whom
in
the
tangle
*NL*
of
her
ideas
she
had
expected
to
see
in
the
nursery
.
The
little
girl
*NL*
sitting
at
the
table
was
obstinately
and
violently
battering
on
it
with
*NL*
a
cork
,
and
staring
aimlessly
at
her
mother
with
her
pitch-black
eyes
.
*NL*
Answering
the
English
nurse
that
she
was
quite
well
,
and
that
she
was
*NL*
going
to
the
country
tomorrow
,
Anna
sat
down
by
the
little
girl
and
*NL*
began
spinning
the
cork
to
show
her
.
But
the
child
's
loud
,
ringing
*NL*
laugh
,
and
the
motion
of
her
eyebrows
,
recalled
Vronsky
so
vividly
that
*NL*
she
got
up
hurriedly
,
restraining
her
sobs
,
and
went
away
.
``
Can
it
be
*NL*
all
over
?
No
,
it
can
not
be
!
''
she
thought
.
``
He
will
come
back
.
But
how
*NL*
can
he
explain
that
smile
,
that
excitement
after
he
had
been
talking
to
*NL*
her
?
But
even
if
he
does
n't
explain
,
I
will
believe
.
If
I
do
n't
believe
,
*NL*
there
's
only
one
thing
left
for
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
her
watch
.
Twenty
minutes
had
passed
.
``
By
now
he
has
*NL*
received
the
note
and
is
coming
back
.
Not
long
,
ten
minutes
more
...
But
*NL*
what
if
he
does
n't
come
?
No
,
that
can
not
be
.
He
must
n't
see
me
with
*NL*
tear-stained
eyes
.
I
'll
go
and
wash
.
Yes
,
yes
;
did
I
do
my
hair
or
not
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
herself
.
And
she
could
not
remember
.
She
felt
her
head
with
*NL*
her
hand
.
``
Yes
,
my
hair
has
been
done
,
but
when
I
did
it
I
ca
n't
in
the
*NL*
least
remember
.
''
She
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
went
up
to
the
pier
glass
to
see
whether
she
really
had
done
her
hair
.
*NL*
She
certainly
had
,
but
she
could
not
think
when
she
had
done
it
.
``
Who
's
*NL*
that
?
''
she
thought
,
looking
in
the
looking
glass
at
the
swollen
face
*NL*
with
strangely
glittering
eyes
,
that
looked
in
a
scared
way
at
her
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
I
!
''
she
suddenly
understood
,
and
looking
round
,
she
seemed
*NL*
all
at
once
to
feel
his
kisses
on
her
,
and
twitched
her
shoulders
,
*NL*
shuddering
.
Then
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
lips
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
Why
,
I
'm
going
out
of
my
mind
!
''
and
she
went
into
her
*NL*
bedroom
,
where
Annushka
was
tidying
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annushka
,
''
she
said
,
coming
to
a
standstill
before
her
,
and
she
stared
*NL*
at
the
maid
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
meant
to
go
and
see
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
''
said
the
girl
,
as
though
*NL*
she
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darya
Alexandrovna
?
Yes
,
I
'll
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
minutes
there

fifteen
minutes
back

He
's
coming
,
he
'll
be
here
*NL*
soon

''
She
took
out
her
watch
and
looked
at
it
.
``
But
how
could
he
go
*NL*
away
,
leaving
me
in
such
a
state
?
How
can
he
live
,
without
making
it
up
*NL*
with
me
?
''
She
went
to
the
window
and
began
looking
into
the
street
.
*NL*
Judging
by
the
time
,
he
might
be
back
now
.
But
her
calculations
might
be
*NL*
wrong
,
and
she
began
once
more
to
recall
when
he
had
started
and
to
*NL*
count
the
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
she
had
moved
away
to
the
big
clock
to
compare
it
*NL*
with
her
watch
,
someone
drove
up
.
Glancing
out
of
the
window
,
she
saw
*NL*
his
carriage
.
But
no
one
came
upstairs
,
and
voices
could
be
heard
below
.
*NL*
It
was
the
messenger
who
had
come
back
in
the
carriage
.
She
went
down
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
n't
catch
the
count

The
count
had
driven
off
on

lower
city
*NL*
road

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
?
What
!
...
''
she
said
to
the
rosy
,
good-humored
Mihail
,
*NL*
as
he
handed
her
back
her
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
then
,
he
has
never
received
it
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
with
this
note
to
Countess
Vronskaya
's
place
,
you
know
?
and
bring
an
*NL*
answer
back

she
said
to
the
messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
what
am
I
going
to
do

''
she
thought
.
``
Yes

shall
go

Yes

and
I
can
telegraph

*NL*
too

''
And
she
wrote
a
telegram
.
``
I
absolutely
must
talk
to
you
;
come
at
*NL*
once
.
''
After
sending
off
the
telegram
,
she
went
to
dress
.
When
she
was
*NL*
dressed
and
in
her
hat
,
she
glanced
again
into
the
eyes
of
the
plump
,
*NL*
comfortable-looking
Annushka
.
There
was
unmistakable
sympathy
in
those
*NL*
good-natured
little
gray
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annushka
,
dear
,
what
am
I
to
do
?
''
said
Anna
,
sobbing
and
sinking
*NL*
helplessly
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
fret
yourself
so
,
Anna
Arkadyevna
?
Why
,
there
's
nothing
out
of
the
*NL*
way

You
drive
out
a
little
,
and
it
'll
cheer
you
up

said
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
'm
going

said
Anna
,
rousing
herself
and
getting
up
.
``
And

*NL*
there
's
a

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

most

all

get
out

this
house

she
said
,
feeling
with
terror
the
strange
*NL*
turmoil
going
on
in
her
own
heart
,
and
she
made
haste
to
go
out
and
get
*NL*
into
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to

''
asked
Pyotr
before
getting
onto

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
bright
and
sunny
.
A
fine
rain
had
been
falling
all
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
now
it
had
not
long
cleared
up
.
The
iron
roofs
,
the
flags
of
the
*NL*
roads
,
the
flints
of
the
pavements
,
the
wheels
and
leather
,
the
brass
*NL*
and
the
tinplate
of
the
carriages
--
all
glistened
brightly
in
the
May
*NL*
sunshine
.
It
was
three
o'clock
,
and
the
very
liveliest
time
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
comfortable
carriage
,
that
hardly
swayed
*NL*
on
its
supple
springs
,
while
the
grays
trotted
swiftly
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
the
unceasing
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
changing
impressions
in
the
pure
*NL*
air
,
Anna
ran
over
the
events
of
the
last
days
,
and
she
saw
her
position
*NL*
quite
differently
from
how
it
had
seemed
at
home
.
Now
the
thought
of
*NL*
death
seemed
no
longer
so
terrible
and
so
clear
to
her
,
and
death
itself
*NL*
no
longer
seemed
so
inevitable
.
Now
she
blamed
herself
for
the
*NL*
humiliation
to
which
she
had
lowered
herself
.
``
I
entreat
him
to
forgive
*NL*
me
.
I
have
given
in
to
him
.
I
have
owned
myself
in
fault
.
What
for
?
*NL*
Ca
n't
I
live
without
him
?
''
And
leaving
unanswered
the
question
how
she
*NL*
was
going
to
live
without
him
,
she
fell
to
reading
the
signs
on
the
*NL*
shops
.
``
Office
and
warehouse

surgeon

Yes
,
I
'll
tell
Dolly
all
*NL*
about
it

She
does
n't
like
Vronsky
.
I
shall
be
sick
and
ashamed
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
tell
her
.
She
loves
me
,
and
I
'll
follow
her
advice
.
I
wo
n't
give
in
*NL*
to
him
;
I
wo
n't
let
him
train
me
as
he
pleases

*NL*
say
they
send

The
Moscow
water

so
good
for

it

Ah
,
the
springs
at
Mitishtchen
,
and
the
pancakes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
remembered
how
,
long
,
long
ago
,
when
she
was
a
girl
of
*NL*
seventeen
,
she
had
gone
with
her
aunt
to
Troitsa
.
``
Riding
,
too
.
Was
that
*NL*
really
me
,
with
red
hands
?
How
much
that
seemed
to
me
then
splendid
and
*NL*
out
of
reach
has
become
worthless
,
while
what
I
had
then
has
gone
out
of
*NL*
my
reach
forever
!
Could
I
ever
have
believed
then
that
I
could
come
to
*NL*
such
humiliation
?
How
conceited
and
self-satisfied
he
will
be
when
he
*NL*
gets
my
note
!
But
I
will
show
him
...
How
horrid
that
paint
smells
!
Why
*NL*
is
it
they
're
always
painting
and
building
?
_
Modes
et
robes

she
read
.
*NL*
A
man
bowed
to
her
.
It
was
Annushka
's
husband
.
``
Our
parasites
''
;
she
*NL*
remembered
how
Vronsky
had
said
that
.
``
Our
?
Why
our
?
What
's
so
awful
is
*NL*
that
one
ca
n't
tear
up
the
past
by
its
roots
.
One
ca
n't
tear
it
out
,
but
*NL*
one
can
hide
one
's
memory
of
it
.
And
I
'll
hide
it
.
''
And
then
she
thought
*NL*
of
her
past
with
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
of
how
she
had
blotted
the
*NL*
memory
of
it
out
of
her
life
.
``
Dolly
will
think
I
'm
leaving
my
second
*NL*
husband

and
so
I
certainly
must
be
in
the
wrong
.
As
if
I
cared
to
be
*NL*
right
!
I
ca
n't
help
it
!
''
she
said
,
and
she
wanted
to
cry
.
But
at
once
*NL*
she
fell
to
wondering
what
those
two
girls
could
be
smiling
about
.
*NL*
``
Love

likely

They
do
n't
know
how
dreary

Yes

I
'm
*NL*
losing
everything

if
he
does
n't
return

Perhaps
he
was
late
for
the
*NL*
train
and
has
come
back
by
now

Longing
for
humiliation
again

she
said
*NL*
to
herself
.
``
No

I
'll
go
to
Dolly

and

straight
out
to

*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
over
the
words
in
which
she
would
tell
Dolly
,
and
mentally
*NL*
working
her
heart
up
to
great
bitterness
,
Anna
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anyone
with

she
asked
in
the
hall

The

were
having
a
consultation
about

when
Anna
called

Dolly
went
down
alone
to
see
the
visitor
who
had
interrupted
their
*NL*
conversation

*NL*
*NL*
``

stopping
in

*NL*
``
I

I

wish
it

said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
Does
Kitty
consider
it
degrading
to
meet
me
?
''
thought
Anna
*NL*
when
she
was
alone
.
``
Perhaps
she
's
right
,
too
.
But
it
's
not
for
her
,
the
*NL*
girl
who
was
in
love
with
Vronsky
,
it
's
not
for
her
to
show
me
that
,
*NL*
even
if
it
is
true
.
I
know
that
in
my
position
I
ca
n't
be
received
by
*NL*
any
decent
woman
.
I
knew
that
from
the
first
moment
I
sacrificed
*NL*
everything
to
him
.
And
this
is
my
reward
!
Oh
,
how
I
hate
him
!
And
what
*NL*
did
I
come
here
for
?
I
'm
worse
here
,
more
miserable
.
''
She
heard
from
the
*NL*
next
room
the
sisters
'
voices
in
consultation
.
``
And
what
am
I
going
to
*NL*
say
to
Dolly
now
?
Amuse
Kitty
by
the
sight
of
my
wretchedness
,
submit
to
*NL*
her
patronizing
?
No
;
and
besides
,
Dolly
would
n't
understand
.
And
it
*NL*
would
be
no
good
my
telling
her
.
It
would
only
be
interesting
to
see
*NL*
Kitty
,
to
show
her
how
I
despise
everyone
and
everything
,
how
nothing
*NL*
matters
to
me
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dolly
came
in
with
the
letter
.
Anna
read
it
and
handed
it
back
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
all
that

she
said
,
``
and
it
does

interest
me
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
so
?
On
the
contrary

I
have
hopes

said
Dolly
,
looking
*NL*
inquisitively
at
Anna
.
She
had
never
seen
her
in
such
a
strangely
*NL*
irritable
condition
.
``
When
are
you
going
away
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
,
half-closing
her
eyes
,
looked
straight
before
her
and
did
not
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
Kitty
shrink
from
me
?
''
she
said
,
looking
at
the
door
and
*NL*
flushing
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
nonsense
!
She
's
nursing
,
and
things
are
n't
going
right
with
*NL*
her
,
and
I
've
been
advising
her
...
She
's
delighted
.
She
'll
be
here
in
a
*NL*
minute
,
''
said
Dolly
awkwardly
,
not
clever
at
lying
.
``
Yes
,
here
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
that
Anna
had
called
,
Kitty
had
wanted
not
to
appear
,
but
Dolly
*NL*
persuaded
her
.
Rallying
her
forces
,
Kitty
went
in
,
walked
up
to
her
,
*NL*
blushing
,
and
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
to
see
you
,
''
she
said
with
a
trembling
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
had
been
thrown
into
confusion
by
the
inward
conflict
between
her
*NL*
antagonism
to
this
bad
woman
and
her
desire
to
be
nice
to
her
.
But
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
saw
Anna
's
lovely
and
attractive
face
,
all
feeling
of
*NL*
antagonism
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
you
had
not
cared
to
meet
me

I
'm
*NL*
used
to
everything
.
You
have
been
ill
?
Yes
,
you
are
changed
,
''
said
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
felt
that
Anna
was
looking
at
her
with
hostile
eyes
.
She
ascribed
*NL*
this
hostility
to
the
awkward
position
in
which
Anna
,
who
had
once
*NL*
patronized
her
,
must
feel
with
her
now
,
and
she
felt
sorry
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
of
Kitty
's
illness
,
of
the
baby
,
of
Stiva
,
but
it
was
*NL*
obvious
that
nothing
interested
Anna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
say
good-bye
to
you
,
''
she
said
,
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
when
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
again
not
answering
,
Anna
turned
to
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
very
glad
to
have
seen
you
,
''
she
said
with
a
smile
.
``
I
have
*NL*
heard
so
much
of
you
from
everyone
,
even
from
your
husband
.
He
came
to
*NL*
see
me
,
and
I
liked
him
exceedingly
,
''
she
said
,
unmistakably
with
*NL*
malicious
intent
.
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
gone
back
to
the
country

''
said
Kitty
,
blushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
me
to
him
,
be
sure
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
sure
to

Kitty
said
naively
,
looking
compassionately
into
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
good-bye
,
Dolly
.
''
And
kissing
Dolly
and
shaking
hands
with
Kitty
,
*NL*
Anna
went
out
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
just
the
same
and
just
as
charming
!
She
's
very
lovely
!
''
said
*NL*
Kitty
,
when
she
was
alone
with
her
sister
.
``
But
there
's
something
*NL*
piteous
about
her

Awfully
piteous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
's
something
unusual
about
her
today
,
''
said
Dolly
.
``
When
I
*NL*
went
with
her
into
the
hall
,
I
fancied
she
was
almost
crying

*NL*
Anna
got
into
the
carriage
again
in
an
even
worse
frame
of
mind
than
*NL*
when
she
set
out
from
home
.
To
her
previous
tortures
was
added
now
that
*NL*
sense
of
mortification
and
of
being
an
outcast
which
she
had
felt
so
*NL*
distinctly
on
meeting
Kitty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
Home
?
''
asked
Pyotr
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

home

she
said
,
not
even
thinking
now
where
she
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
they
looked
at
me
as
something
dreadful
,
incomprehensible
,
and
*NL*
curious
!
What
can
he
be
telling
the
other
with
such
warmth
?
''
she
*NL*
thought
,
staring
at
two
men
who
walked
by
.
``
Can
one
ever
tell
anyone
*NL*
what
one
is
feeling
?
I
meant
to
tell
Dolly
,
and
it
's
a
good
thing
I
*NL*
did
n't
tell
her
.
How
pleased
she
would
have
been
at
my
misery
!
She
would
*NL*
have
concealed
it
,
but
her
chief
feeling
would
have
been
delight
at
my
*NL*
being
punished
for
the
happiness
she
envied
me
for
.
Kitty
,
she
would
*NL*
have
been
even
more
pleased
.
How
I
can
see
through
her
!
She
knows
I
was
*NL*
more
than
usually
sweet
to
her
husband
.
And
she
's
jealous
and
hates
me
.
*NL*
And
she
despises
me
.
In
her
eyes
I
'm
an
immoral
woman
.
If
I
were
an
*NL*
immoral
woman
I
could
have
made
her
husband
fall
in
love
with
me
...
if
*NL*
I
'd
cared
to

And
,
indeed
,
I
did
care
to

There
's
someone
who
's
pleased
*NL*
with
himself
,
''
she
thought
,
as
she
saw
a
fat
,
rubicund
gentleman
coming
*NL*
towards
her
.
He
took
her
for
an
acquaintance
,
and
lifted
his
glossy
hat
*NL*
above
his
bald
,
glossy
head
,
and
then
perceived
his
mistake
.
``
He
thought
*NL*
he
knew
me
.
Well
,
he
knows
me
as
well
as
anyone
in
the
world
knows
me
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
myself

I
know
my
appetites
,
as
the
French
say
.
They
want
*NL*
that
dirty
ice
cream
,
that
they
do
know
for
certain

''
she
thought
,
*NL*
looking
at
two
boys
stopping
an
ice
cream
seller
,
who
took
a
barrel
off
*NL*
his
head
and
began
wiping
his
perspiring
face
with
a
towel
.
``
We
all
want
*NL*
what
is
sweet
and
nice

If
not
sweetmeats

then
a
dirty
ice

And
Kitty
's
*NL*
the
same
--
if
not
Vronsky
,
then
Levin
.
And
she
envies
me
,
and
hates
me

*NL*
And
we
all

''
she
thought
and
smiled
.
But
the
same
instant
*NL*
she
remembered
that
she
had
no
one
now
to
tell
anything
amusing
to
.
``
And
*NL*
there
's
nothing
amusing
,
nothing
mirthful

really

It
's
all
hateful
.
*NL*
They
're
singing
for
vespers
,
and
how
carefully
that
merchant
crosses
*NL*
himself
!
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
missing
something
.
Why
these
churches
*NL*
and
this
singing
and
this
humbug
?
Simply
to
conceal
that
we
all
hate
*NL*
each
other
like
these
cab
drivers
who
are
abusing
each
other
so
angrily
.

says
,
`
He
wants

him
of

'
Yes
,
*NL*
that
's
the
truth

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
plunged
in
these
thoughts
,
which
so
engrossed
her
that
she
left
*NL*
off
thinking
of
her
own
position
,
when
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
steps
*NL*
of
her
house
.
It
was
only
when
she
saw
the
porter
running
out
to
meet
*NL*
her
that
she
remembered
she
had
sent
the
note
and
the
telegram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
an
answer
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
this
minute
,
''
answered
the
porter
,
and
glancing
into
his
room
,
*NL*
he
took
out
and
gave
her
the
thin
square
envelope
of
a
telegram
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
come
before
ten
o'clock

Vronsky

''
she
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
has
n't
the
messenger
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
answered
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
since
it
's
so
,
I
know
what
I
must
do
,
''
she
said
,
and
feeling
a
*NL*
vague
fury
and
craving
for
revenge
rising
up
within
her
,
she
ran
*NL*
upstairs
.
``
I
'll
go
to
him
myself
.
Before
going
away
forever
,
I
'll
tell
*NL*
him
all
.
Never
have
I
hated
anyone
as
I
hate
that
man
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
Seeing
his
hat
on
the
rack
,
she
shuddered
with
aversion
.
She
did
not
*NL*
consider
that
his
telegram
was
an
answer
to
her
telegram
and
that
he
had
*NL*
not
yet
received
her
note
.
She
pictured
him
to
herself
as
talking
calmly
*NL*
to
his
mother
and
Princess
Sorokina
and
rejoicing
at
her
sufferings
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
must
go
quickly
,
''
she
said
,
not
knowing
yet
where
she
was
going
.
*NL*
She
longed
to
get
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
feelings
she
had
*NL*
gone
through
in
that
awful
house
.
The
servants
,
the
walls
,
the
things
in
*NL*
that
house
--
all
aroused
repulsion
and
hatred
in
her
and
lay
like
a
*NL*
weight
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
must
go
to
the
railway
station
,
and
if
he
's
not
there
,
then
go
*NL*
there
and
catch
him
.
''
Anna
looked
at
the
railway
timetable
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
.
An
evening
train
went
at
two
minutes
past
eight
.
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
in
time
.
''
She
gave
orders
for
the
other
horses
to
be
put
in
the
*NL*
carriage
,
and
packed
in
a
traveling-bag
the
things
needed
for
a
few
*NL*
days
.
She
knew
she
would
never
come
back
here
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
plans
that
came
into
her
head
she
vaguely
determined
that
*NL*
after
what
would
happen
at
the
station
or
at
the
countess
's
house
,
she
*NL*
would
go
as
far
as
the
first
town
on
the
Nizhni
road
and
stop
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
on
the
table
;
she
went
up
,
but
the
smell
of
the
bread
and
*NL*
cheese
was
enough
to
make
her
feel
that
all
food
was
disgusting
.
She
*NL*
ordered
the
carriage
and
went
out
.
The
house
threw
a
shadow
now
right
*NL*
across
the
street
,
but
it
was
a
bright
evening
and
still
warm
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
Annushka
,
who
came
down
with
her
things
,
and
Pyotr
,
who
put
*NL*
the
things
in
the
carriage
,
and
the
coachman
,
evidently
out
of
humor
,
*NL*
were
all
hateful
to
her
,
and
irritated
her
by
their
words
and
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

she
said
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pyotr
jumped
on
the
box
,
and
putting
his
arms
akimbo
,
told
the
coachman
*NL*
to
drive
to
the
booking-office
.

``

Anna
said
to
herself
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
carriage
had
started
and
swaying
lightly
,
rumbled
over
the
*NL*
tiny
cobbles
of
the
paved
road
,
and
again
one
impression
followed
*NL*
rapidly
upon
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
what
was
the
last
thing
I
thought
of
so
clearly
?
''
she
tried
to
*NL*
recall
it
.

no

not

of

*NL*
says
,
the
struggle
for
existence
and
hatred
is
the
one
thing
that
holds
*NL*
men
together
.
No
,
it
's
a
useless
journey
you
're
making
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
mentally
addressing
a
party
in
a
coach
and
four
,
evidently
going
for
an
*NL*
excursion
into
the
country
.
``
And
the
dog
you
're
taking
with
you
will
be
*NL*
no
help
to
you
.
You
ca
n't
get
away
from
yourselves
.
''
Turning
her
eyes
in
*NL*
the
direction
Pyotr
had
turned
to
look
,
she
saw
a
factory
hand
almost
*NL*
dead
drunk
,
with
hanging
head
,
being
led
away
by
a
policeman
.
``
Come
,
*NL*
he
's
found
a
quicker
way
,
''
she
thought
.
``
Count
Vronsky
and
I
did
not
*NL*
find
that
happiness
either
,
though
we
expected
so
much
from
it
.
''
And
now
*NL*
for
the
first
time
Anna
turned
that
glaring
light
in
which
she
was
*NL*
seeing
everything
on
to
her
relations
with
him
,
which
she
had
hitherto
*NL*
avoided
thinking
about
.
``
What
was
it
he
sought
in
me
?
Not
love
so
much
*NL*
as
the
satisfaction
of
vanity
.
''
She
remembered
his
words
,
the
expression
*NL*
of
his
face
,
that
recalled
an
abject
setter-dog
,
in
the
early
days
of
*NL*
their
connection
.
And
everything
now
confirmed
this
.
``
Yes
,
there
was
the
*NL*
triumph
of
success
in
him
.
Of
course
there
was
love
too
,
but
the
chief
*NL*
element
was
the
pride
of
success
.
He
boasted
of
me
.
Now
that
's
over
.
*NL*
There
's
nothing
to
be
proud
of
.
Not
to
be
proud
of
,
but
to
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
.
He
has
taken
from
me
all
he
could
,
and
now
I
am
no
use
to
him
.
He
is
*NL*
weary
of
me
and
is
trying
not
to
be
dishonorable
in
his
behavior
to
me
.
*NL*
He
let
that
out
yesterday
--
he
wants
divorce
and
marriage
so
as
to
burn
*NL*
his
ships
.
He
loves
me
,
but
how
?
The
zest
is
gone
,
as
the
English
say
.
*NL*
That
fellow
wants
everyone
to
admire
him
and
is
very
much
pleased
with
*NL*
himself
,
''
she
thought
,
looking
at
a
red-faced
clerk
,
riding
on
a
riding
*NL*
school
horse
.
``
Yes
,
there
's
not
the
same
flavor
about
me
for
him
now
.
If
*NL*
I
go
away
from
him
,
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
will
be
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
mere
supposition
,
she
saw
it
distinctly
in
the
piercing
*NL*
light
,
which
revealed
to
her
now
the
meaning
of
life
and
human
*NL*
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
keeps
growing
more
passionate
and
egoistic
,
while
his
is
waning
*NL*
and
waning
,
and
that
's
why
we
're
drifting
apart
.
''
She
went
on
musing
.
*NL*
``
And
there
's
no
help
for
it
.
He
is
everything
for
me
,
and
I
want
him
*NL*
more
and
more
to
give
himself
up
to
me
entirely
.
And
he
wants
more
and
*NL*
more
to
get
away
from
me
.
We
walked
to
meet
each
other
up
to
the
time
of
*NL*
our
love
,
and
then
we
have
been
irresistibly
drifting
in
different
*NL*
directions
.
And
there
's
no
altering
that
.
He
tells
me
I
'm
insanely
*NL*
jealous
,
and
I
have
told
myself
that
I
am
insanely
jealous
;
but
it
's
not
*NL*
true
.
I
'm
not
jealous
,
but
I
'm
unsatisfied
.
But
...
''
she
opened
her
lips
,
*NL*
and
shifted
her
place
in
the
carriage
in
the
excitement
,
aroused
by
the
*NL*
thought
that
suddenly
struck
her
.
``
If
I
could
be
anything
but
a
*NL*
mistress
,
passionately
caring
for
nothing
but
his
caresses
;
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
care
to
be
anything
else
.
And
by
that
desire
I
rouse
*NL*
aversion
in
him
,
and
he
rouses
fury
in
me
,
and
it
can
not
be
different
.
*NL*
Do
n't
I
know
that
he
would
n't
deceive
me
,
that
he
has
no
schemes
about
*NL*
Princess
Sorokina
,
that
he
's
not
in
love
with
Kitty
,
that
he
wo
n't
*NL*
desert
me
!
I
know
all
that
,
but
it
makes
it
no
better
for
me
.
If
without
*NL*
loving
me
,
from
_
duty
_
he
'll
be
good
and
kind
to
me
,
without
what
I
*NL*
want
,
that
's
a
thousand
times
worse
than
unkindness
!
That
's
--
hell
!
And
*NL*
that
's
just
how
it
is
.
For
a
long
while
now
he
has
n't
loved
me
.
And
*NL*
where
love
ends
,
hate
begins
.
I
do
n't
know
these
streets
at
all
.
Hills
*NL*
it
seems
,
and
still
houses
,
and
houses
...
And
in
the
houses
always
*NL*
people
and
people
...
How
many
of
them
,
no
end
,
and
all
hating
each
*NL*
other
!
Come
,
let
me
try
and
think
what
I
want
,
to
make
me
happy
.
Well
?
*NL*
Suppose
I
am
divorced
,
and
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
lets
me
have
Seryozha
,
*NL*
and
I
marry
Vronsky
.
''
Thinking
of
Alexey
Alexandrovitch
,
she
at
once
*NL*
pictured
him
with
extraordinary
vividness
as
though
he
were
alive
before
*NL*
her
,
with
his
mild
,
lifeless
,
dull
eyes
,
the
blue
veins
in
his
white
*NL*
hands
,
his
intonations
and
the
cracking
of
his
fingers
,
and
remembering
*NL*
the
feeling
which
had
existed
between
them
,
and
which
was
also
called
*NL*
love
,
she
shuddered
with
loathing
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
divorced
,
and
become
*NL*
Vronsky
's
wife
.
Well
,
will
Kitty
cease
looking
at
me
as
she
looked
at
me
*NL*
today
?
No
.
And
will
Seryozha
leave
off
asking
and
wondering
about
my
two
*NL*
husbands
?
And
is
there
any
new
feeling
I
can
awaken
between
Vronsky
and
*NL*
me
?
Is
there
possible
,
if
not
happiness
,
some
sort
of
ease
from
misery
?
*NL*
No
,
no
!
''
she
answered
now
without
the
slightest
hesitation
.
``
Impossible
!
*NL*
We
are
drawn
apart
by
life
,
and
I
make
his
unhappiness
,
and
he
mine
,
and
*NL*
there
's
no
altering
him
or
me
.
Every
attempt
has
been
made
,
the
screw
*NL*
has
come
unscrewed
.
Oh
,
a
beggar
woman
with
a
baby
.
She
thinks
I
'm
sorry
*NL*
for
her
.
Are
n't
we
all
flung
into
the
world
only
to
hate
each
other
,
and
*NL*
so
to
torture
ourselves
and
each
other
?
Schoolboys
coming
--
laughing
*NL*
Seryozha
?
''
she
thought
.
``
I
thought
,
too
,
that
I
loved
him
,
and
used
to
*NL*
be
touched
by
my
own
tenderness
.
But
I
have
lived
without
him
,
I
gave
*NL*
him
up
for
another
love
,
and
did
not
regret
the
exchange
till
that
love
*NL*
was
satisfied
.
''
And
with
loathing
she
thought
of
what
she
meant
by
that
*NL*
love
.
And
the
clearness
with
which
she
saw
life
now
,
her
own
and
all
*NL*
men
's
,
was
a
pleasure
to
her
.
``
It
's
so
with
me
and
Pyotr
,
and
the
*NL*
coachman
,
Fyodor
,
and
that
merchant
,
and
all
the
people
living
along
the
*NL*
Volga
,
where
those
placards
invite
one
to
go
,
and
everywhere
and
*NL*
always
,
''
she
thought
when
she
had
driven
under
the
low-pitched
roof
of
*NL*
the
Nizhigorod
station
,
and
the
porters
ran
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ticket
to
Obiralovka
?
''
said
Pyotr
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
utterly
forgotten
where
and
why
she
was
going
,
and
only
by
a
*NL*
great
effort
she
understood
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
handing
him
her
purse
,
and
taking
a
little
red
bag
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Making
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
first-class
waiting-room
,
she
*NL*
gradually
recollected
all
the
details
of
her
position
,
and
the
plans
*NL*
between
which
she
was
hesitating
.
And
again
at
the
old
sore
places
,
hope
*NL*
and
then
despair
poisoned
the
wounds
of
her
tortured
,
fearfully
*NL*
throbbing
heart
.
As
she
sat
on
the
star-shaped
sofa
waiting
for
the
*NL*
train
,
she
gazed
with
aversion
at
the
people
coming
and
going
-LRB-
they
were
*NL*
all
hateful
to
her
-RRB-
,
and
thought
how
she
would
arrive
at
the
station
,
*NL*
would
write
him
a
note
,
and
what
she
would
write
to
him
,
and
how
he
was
*NL*
at
this
moment
complaining
to
his
mother
of
his
position
,
not
*NL*
understanding
her
sufferings
,
and
how
she
would
go
into
the
room
,
and
*NL*
what
she
would
say
to
him
.
Then
she
thought
that
life
might
still
be
*NL*
happy
,
and
how
miserably
she
loved
and
hated
him
,
and
how
fearfully
her
*NL*
heart
was
beating
.

Chapter
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
rang
,
some
young
men
,
ugly
and
impudent
,
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
careful
of
the
impression
they
were
making
,
hurried
by
.
Pyotr
,
too
,
*NL*
crossed
the
room
in
his
livery
and
top-boots
,
with
his
dull
,
animal
*NL*
face
,
and
came
up
to
her
to
take
her
to
the
train
.
Some
noisy
men
were
*NL*
quiet
as
she
passed
them
on
the
platform
,
and
one
whispered
something
*NL*
about
her
to
another
--
something
vile
,
no
doubt
.
She
stepped
up
on
the
*NL*
high
step
,
and
sat
down
in
a
carriage
by
herself
on
a
dirty
seat
that
*NL*
had
been
white
.
Her
bag
lay
beside
her
,
shaken
up
and
down
by
the
*NL*
springiness
of
the
seat
.
With
a
foolish
smile
Pyotr
raised
his
hat
,
with
*NL*
its
colored
band
,
at
the
window
,
in
token
of
farewell
;
an
impudent
*NL*
conductor
slammed
the
door
and
the
latch
.
A
grotesque-looking
lady
*NL*
wearing
a
bustle
-LRB-
Anna
mentally
undressed
the
woman
,
and
was
appalled
at
*NL*
her
hideousness
-RRB-
,
and
a
little
girl
laughing
affectedly
ran
down
the
*NL*
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Andreevna
,
she
's
got
them
all
,
_
ma
tante
!
_
''
cried
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
the
child
's
hideous
and
affected
,
''
thought
Anna
.
To
avoid
seeing
*NL*
anyone
,
she
got
up
quickly
and
seated
herself
at
the
opposite
window
of
*NL*
the
empty
carriage
.
A
misshapen-looking
peasant
covered
with
dirt
,
in
a
*NL*
cap
from
which
his
tangled
hair
stuck
out
all
round
,
passed
by
that
*NL*
window
,
stooping
down
to
the
carriage
wheels
.
``
There
's
something
*NL*
familiar
about
that
hideous
peasant
,
''
thought
Anna
.
And
remembering
her
*NL*
dream
,
she
moved
away
to
the
opposite
door
,
shaking
with
terror
.
The
*NL*
conductor
opened
the
door
and
let
in
a
man
and
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
get
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anna
made
no
answer
.
The
conductor
and
her
two
fellow-passengers
did
not
*NL*
notice
under
her
veil
her
panic-stricken
face
.
She
went
back
to
her
*NL*
corner
and
sat
down
.
The
couple
seated
themselves
on
the
opposite
side
,
*NL*
and
intently
but
surreptitiously
scrutinized
her
clothes
.
Both
husband
*NL*
and
wife
seemed
repulsive
to
Anna
.
The
husband
asked
,
would
she
allow
*NL*
him
to
smoke
,
obviously
not
with
a
view
to
smoking
but
to
getting
into
*NL*
conversation
with
her
.
Receiving
her
assent
,
he
said
to
his
wife
in
*NL*
French
something
about
caring
less
to
smoke
than
to
talk
.
They
made
*NL*
inane
and
affected
remarks
to
one
another
,
entirely
for
her
benefit
.
*NL*
Anna
saw
clearly
that
they
were
sick
of
each
other
,
and
hated
each
*NL*
other
.
And
no
one
could
have
helped
hating
such
miserable
monstrosities
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
bell
sounded
,
and
was
followed
by
moving
of
luggage
,
noise
,
*NL*
shouting
and
laughter
.
It
was
so
clear
to
Anna
that
there
was
nothing
*NL*
for
anyone
to
be
glad
of
,
that
this
laughter
irritated
her
agonizingly
,
*NL*
and
she
would
have
liked
to
stop
up
her
ears
not
to
hear
it
.
At
last
the
*NL*
third
bell
rang
,
there
was
a
whistle
and
a
hiss
of
steam
,
and
a
clank
of
*NL*
chains
,
and
the
man
in
her
carriage
crossed
himself
.
``
It
would
be
*NL*
interesting
to
ask
him
what
meaning
he
attaches
to
that
,
''
thought
Anna
,
*NL*
looking
angrily
at
him
.
She
looked
past
the
lady
out
of
the
window
at
*NL*
the
people
who
seemed
whirling
by
as
they
ran
beside
the
train
or
stood
*NL*
on
the
platform
.
The
train
,
jerking
at
regular
intervals
at
the
*NL*
junctions
of
the
rails
,
rolled
by
the
platform
,
past
a
stone
wall
,
a
*NL*
signal-box
,
past
other
trains
;
the
wheels
,
moving
more
smoothly
and
*NL*
evenly
,
resounded
with
a
slight
clang
on
the
rails
.
The
window
was
*NL*
lighted
up
by
the
bright
evening
sun
,
and
a
slight
breeze
fluttered
the
*NL*
curtain
.
Anna
forgot
her
fellow
passengers
,
and
to
the
light
swaying
of
*NL*
the
train
she
fell
to
thinking
again
,
as
she
breathed
the
fresh
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
did
I
stop
at
?
That
I
could
n't
conceive
a
position
in
which
*NL*
life
would
not
be
a
misery
,
that
we
are
all
created
to
be
miserable
,
and
*NL*
that
we
all
know
it
,
and
all
invent
means
of
deceiving
each
other
.
And
*NL*
when
one
sees
the
truth
,
what
is
one
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
reason
is
given
man
for
,
to
escape
from
what
worries
him
,
''
*NL*
said
the
lady
in
French
,
lisping
affectedly
,
and
obviously
pleased
with
*NL*
her
phrase
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
seemed
an
answer
to
Anna
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
escape
from
what
worries
him
,
''
repeated
Anna
.
And
glancing
at
the
*NL*
red-cheeked
husband
and
the
thin
wife
,
she
saw
that
the
sickly
wife
*NL*
considered
herself
misunderstood
,
and
the
husband
deceived
her
and
*NL*
encouraged
her
in
that
idea
of
herself
.
Anna
seemed
to
see
all
their
*NL*
history
and
all
the
crannies
of
their
souls
,
as
it
were
turning
a
light
*NL*
upon
them
.
But
there
was
nothing
interesting
in
them
,
and
she
pursued
*NL*
her
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
very
much
worried
,
and
that
's
what
reason
was
given
me
for
,
to
*NL*
escape
;
so
then
one
must
escape
:
why
not
put
out
the
light
when
there
's
*NL*
nothing
more
to
look
at
,
when
it
's
sickening
to
look
at
it
all
?
But
how
?
*NL*
Why
did
the
conductor
run
along
the
footboard
,
why
are
they
shrieking
,
*NL*
those
young
men
in
that
train
?
why
are
they
talking
,
why
are
they
*NL*
laughing
?
It
's
all
falsehood
,
all
lying
,
all
humbug
,
all
cruelty
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
train
came
into
the
station
,
Anna
got
out
into
the
crowd
of
*NL*
passengers
,
and
moving
apart
from
them
as
if
they
were
lepers
,
she
stood
*NL*
on
the
platform
,
trying
to
think
what
she
had
come
here
for
,
and
what
*NL*
she
meant
to
do
.
Everything
that
had
seemed
to
her
possible
before
was
*NL*
now
so
difficult
to
consider
,
especially
in
this
noisy
crowd
of
hideous
*NL*
people
who
would
not
leave
her
alone
.
One
moment
porters
ran
up
to
her
*NL*
proffering
their
services
,
then
young
men
,
clacking
their
heels
on
the
*NL*
planks
of
the
platform
and
talking
loudly
,
stared
at
her
;
people
meeting
*NL*
her
dodged
past
on
the
wrong
side
.
Remembering
that
she
had
meant
to
go
*NL*
on
further
if
there
were
no
answer
,
she
stopped
a
porter
and
asked
if
*NL*
her
coachman
were
not
here
with
a
note
from
Count
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
Vronsky
?
They
sent
up
here
from
the
Vronskys
just
this
minute
,
to
*NL*
meet
Princess
Sorokina
and
her
daughter
.
And
what
is
the
coachman
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
she
was
talking
to
the
porter
,
the
coachman
Mihail
,
red
and
*NL*
cheerful
in
his
smart
blue
coat
and
chain
,
evidently
proud
of
having
so
*NL*
successfully
performed
his
commission
,
came
up
to
her
and
gave
her
a
*NL*
letter
.
She
broke
it
open
,
and
her
heart
ached
before
she
had
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
your
note
did
not
reach
me
.
I
will
be
home
at
ten
,
''
*NL*
Vronsky
had
written
carelessly
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
what
I
expected
!
''
she
said
to
herself
with
an
evil
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
you
can
go
home
then
,
''
she
said
softly
,
addressing
Mihail
.
*NL*
She
spoke
softly
because
the
rapidity
of
her
heart
's
beating
hindered
*NL*
her
breathing
.
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
let
you
make
me
miserable
,
''
she
thought
*NL*
menacingly
,
addressing
not
him
,
not
herself
,
but
the
power
that
made
her
*NL*
suffer
,
and
she
walked
along
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
maid-servants
walking
along
the
platform
turned
their
heads
,
staring
*NL*
at
her
and
making
some
remarks
about
her
dress
.
``
Real
,
''
they
said
of
the
*NL*
lace
she
was
wearing
.
The
young
men
would
not
leave
her
in
peace
.
Again
*NL*
they
passed
by
,
peering
into
her
face
,
and
with
a
laugh
shouting
*NL*
something
in
an
unnatural
voice
.
The
station-master
coming
up
asked
her
*NL*
whether
she
was
going
by
train
.
A
boy
selling
kvas
never
took
his
eyes
*NL*
off
her
.
``
My
God
!
where
am
I
to
go
?
''
she
thought
,
going
farther
and
*NL*
farther
along
the
platform
.
At
the
end
she
stopped
.
Some
ladies
and
*NL*
children
,
who
had
come
to
meet
a
gentleman
in
spectacles
,
paused
in
*NL*
their
loud
laughter
and
talking
,
and
stared
at
her
as
she
reached
them
.
*NL*
She
quickened
her
pace
and
walked
away
from
them
to
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
platform
.
A
luggage
train
was
coming
in
.
The
platform
began
to
sway
,
and
*NL*
she
fancied
she
was
in
the
train
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
at
once
she
thought
of
the
man
crushed
by
the
train
the
day
she
*NL*
had
first
met
Vronsky
,
and
she
knew
what
she
had
to
do
.
With
a
rapid
,
*NL*
light
step
she
went
down
the
steps
that
led
from
the
tank
to
the
rails
*NL*
and
stopped
quite
near
the
approaching
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
lower
part
of
the
carriages
,
at
the
screws
and
chains
*NL*
and
the
tall
cast-iron
wheel
of
the
first
carriage
slowly
moving
up
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
measure
the
middle
between
the
front
and
back
wheels
,
and
the
*NL*
very
minute
when
that
middle
point
would
be
opposite
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
looking
into
the
shadow
of
the
carriage
,
*NL*
at
the
sand
and
coal
dust
which
covered
the
sleepers
--
``
there
,
in
the
*NL*
very
middle
,
and
I
will
punish
him
and
escape
from
everyone
and
from
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
fling
herself
below
the
wheels
of
the
first
carriage
as
it
*NL*
reached
her
;
but
the
red
bag
which
she
tried
to
drop
out
of
her
hand
*NL*
delayed
her
,
and
she
was
too
late
;
she
missed
the
moment
.
She
had
to
*NL*
wait
for
the
next
carriage
.
A
feeling
such
as
she
had
known
when
about
*NL*
to
take
the
first
plunge
in
bathing
came
upon
her
,
and
she
crossed
*NL*
herself
.
That
familiar
gesture
brought
back
into
her
soul
a
whole
series
*NL*
of
girlish
and
childish
memories
,
and
suddenly
the
darkness
that
had
*NL*
covered
everything
for
her
was
torn
apart
,
and
life
rose
up
before
her
*NL*
for
an
instant
with
all
its
bright
past
joys
.
But
she
did
not
take
her
*NL*
eyes
from
the
wheels
of
the
second
carriage
.
And
exactly
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
the
space
between
the
wheels
came
opposite
her
,
she
dropped
the
red
*NL*
bag
,
and
drawing
her
head
back
into
her
shoulders
,
fell
on
her
hands
*NL*
under
the
carriage
,
and
lightly
,
as
though
she
would
rise
again
at
once
,
*NL*
dropped
on
to
her
knees
.
And
at
the
same
instant
she
was
terror-stricken
*NL*
at
what
she
was
doing
.
``
Where
am
I
?
What
am
I
doing
?
What
for
?
''
She
*NL*
tried
to
get
up
,
to
drop
backwards
;
but
something
huge
and
merciless
*NL*
struck
her
on
the
head
and
rolled
her
on
her
back
.
``
Lord
,
forgive
me
*NL*
all
!
''
she
said
,
feeling
it
impossible
to
struggle
.
A
peasant
muttering
*NL*
something
was
working
at
the
iron
above
her
.
And
the
light
by
which
she
*NL*
had
read
the
book
filled
with
troubles
,
falsehoods
,
sorrow
,
and
evil
,
*NL*
flared
up
more
brightly
than
ever
before
,
lighted
up
for
her
all
that
*NL*
had
been
in
darkness
,
flickered
,
began
to
grow
dim
,
and
was
quenched
*NL*
forever
.

PART
EIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
two
months
had
passed
.
The
hot
summer
was
half
over
,
but
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
was
only
just
preparing
to
leave
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
life
had
not
been
uneventful
during
this
time
.
A
*NL*
year
ago
he
had
finished
his
book
,
the
fruit
of
six
years
'
labor
,
*NL*
``
Sketch
of
a
Survey
of
the
Principles
and
Forms
of
Government
in
Europe
*NL*
and
Russia
.
''
Several
sections
of
this
book
and
its
introduction
had
*NL*
appeared
in
periodical
publications
,
and
other
parts
had
been
read
by
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
to
persons
of
his
circle
,
so
that
the
leading
ideas
of
*NL*
the
work
could
not
be
completely
novel
to
the
public
.
But
still
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
had
expected
that
on
its
appearance
his
book
would
be
sure
to
*NL*
make
a
serious
impression
on
society
,
and
if
it
did
not
cause
a
*NL*
revolution
in
social
science
it
would
,
at
any
rate
,
make
a
great
stir
in
*NL*
the
scientific
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
most
conscientious
revision
the
book
had
last
year
been
*NL*
published
,
and
had
been
distributed
among
the
booksellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
asked
no
one
about
it
,
reluctantly
and
with
feigned
*NL*
indifference
answered
his
friends
'
inquiries
as
to
how
the
book
was
*NL*
going
,
and
did
not
even
inquire
of
the
booksellers
how
the
book
was
*NL*
selling
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
all
on
the
alert
,
with
strained
*NL*
attention
,
watching
for
the
first
impression
his
book
would
make
in
the
*NL*
world
and
in
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
week
passed
,
a
second
,
a
third
,
and
in
society
no
impression
*NL*
whatever
could
be
detected
.
His
friends
who
were
specialists
and
*NL*
savants
,
occasionally
--
unmistakably
from
politeness
--
alluded
to
it
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
his
acquaintances
,
not
interested
in
a
book
on
a
learned
*NL*
subject
,
did
not
talk
of
it
at
all
.
And
society
generally
--
just
now
*NL*
especially
absorbed
in
other
things
--
was
absolutely
indifferent
.
In
the
*NL*
press
,
too
,
for
a
whole
month
there
was
not
a
word
about
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
calculated
to
a
nicety
the
time
necessary
for
*NL*
writing
a
review
,
but
a
month
passed
,
and
a
second
,
and
still
there
was
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
in
the
_
Northern
Beetle
_
,
in
a
comic
article
on
the
singer
*NL*
Drabanti
,
who
had
lost
his
voice
,
there
was
a
contemptuous
allusion
to
*NL*
Koznishev
's
book
,
suggesting
that
the
book
had
been
long
ago
seen
*NL*
through
by
everyone
,
and
was
a
subject
of
general
ridicule
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
in
the
third
month
a
critical
article
appeared
in
a
serious
*NL*
review
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
knew
the
author
of
the
article
.
He
had
met
him
*NL*
once
at
Golubtsov
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
of
the
article
was
a
young
man
,
an
invalid
,
very
bold
as
a
*NL*
writer
,
but
extremely
deficient
in
breeding
and
shy
in
personal
*NL*
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
absolute
contempt
for
the
author
,
it
was
with
complete
*NL*
respect
that
Sergey
Ivanovitch
set
about
reading
the
article
.
The
*NL*
article
was
awful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
critic
had
undoubtedly
put
an
interpretation
upon
the
book
which
*NL*
could
not
possibly
be
put
on
it
.
But
he
had
selected
quotations
so
*NL*
adroitly
that
for
people
who
had
not
read
the
book
-LRB-
and
obviously
*NL*
scarcely
anyone
had
read
it
-RRB-
it
seemed
absolutely
clear
that
the
whole
*NL*
book
was
nothing
but
a
medley
of
high-flown
phrases
,
not
even
--
as
*NL*
suggested
by
marks
of
interrogation
--
used
appropriately
,
and
that
the
*NL*
author
of
the
book
was
a
person
absolutely
without
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
subject
.
And
all
this
was
so
wittily
done
that
Sergey
Ivanovitch
would
*NL*
not
have
disowned
such
wit
himself
.
But
that
was
just
what
was
so
awful
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
scrupulous
conscientiousness
with
which
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
verified
the
correctness
of
the
critic
's
arguments
,
he
did
*NL*
not
for
a
minute
stop
to
ponder
over
the
faults
and
mistakes
which
were
*NL*
ridiculed
;
but
unconsciously
he
began
immediately
trying
to
recall
every
*NL*
detail
of
his
meeting
and
conversation
with
the
author
of
the
article
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
offend
him
in
some
way
?
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
wondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
remembering
that
when
they
met
he
had
corrected
the
young
man
about
*NL*
something
he
had
said
that
betrayed
ignorance
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
found
*NL*
the
clue
to
explain
the
article
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
article
was
followed
by
a
deadly
silence
about
the
book
both
in
the
*NL*
press
and
in
conversation
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
saw
that
his
six
years
'
*NL*
task
,
toiled
at
with
such
love
and
labor
,
had
gone
,
leaving
no
trace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
position
was
still
more
difficult
from
the
fact
*NL*
that
,
since
he
had
finished
his
book
,
he
had
had
no
more
literary
work
*NL*
to
do
,
such
as
had
hitherto
occupied
the
greater
part
of
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
clever
,
cultivated
,
healthy
,
and
energetic
,
and
he
*NL*
did
not
know
what
use
to
make
of
his
energy
.
Conversations
in
drawing
*NL*
rooms
,
in
meetings
,
assemblies
,
and
committees
--
everywhere
where
talk
*NL*
was
possible
--
took
up
part
of
his
time
.
But
being
used
for
years
to
town
*NL*
life
,
he
did
not
waste
all
his
energies
in
talk
,
as
his
less
experienced
*NL*
younger
brother
did
,
when
he
was
in
Moscow
.
He
had
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
leisure
and
intellectual
energy
still
to
dispose
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
for
him
,
at
this
period
so
difficult
for
him
from
the
*NL*
failure
of
his
book
,
the
various
public
questions
of
the
dissenting
*NL*
sects
,
of
the
American
alliance
,
of
the
Samara
famine
,
of
exhibitions
,
*NL*
and
of
spiritualism
,
were
definitely
replaced
in
public
interest
by
the
*NL*
Slavonic
question
,
which
had
hitherto
rather
languidly
interested
*NL*
society
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
who
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
raise
*NL*
this
subject
,
threw
himself
into
it
heart
and
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
circle
to
which
Sergey
Ivanovitch
belonged
,
nothing
was
talked
of
*NL*
or
written
about
just
now
but
the
Servian
War
.
Everything
that
the
idle
*NL*
crowd
usually
does
to
kill
time
was
done
now
for
the
benefit
of
the
*NL*
Slavonic
States
.
Balls
,
concerts
,
dinners
,
matchboxes
,
ladies
'
dresses
,
*NL*
beer
,
restaurants
--
everything
testified
to
sympathy
with
the
Slavonic
*NL*
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
much
of
what
was
spoken
and
written
on
the
subject
,
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
differed
on
various
points
.
He
saw
that
the
Slavonic
question
*NL*
had
become
one
of
those
fashionable
distractions
which
succeed
one
*NL*
another
in
providing
society
with
an
object
and
an
occupation
.
He
saw
,
*NL*
too
,
that
a
great
many
people
were
taking
up
the
subject
from
motives
of
*NL*
self-interest
and
self-advertisement
.
He
recognized
that
the
newspapers
*NL*
published
a
great
deal
that
was
superfluous
and
exaggerated
,
with
the
*NL*
sole
aim
of
attracting
attention
and
outbidding
one
another
.
He
saw
that
*NL*
in
this
general
movement
those
who
thrust
themselves
most
forward
and
*NL*
shouted
the
loudest
were
men
who
had
failed
and
were
smarting
under
a
*NL*
sense
of
injury
--
generals
without
armies
,
ministers
not
in
the
ministry
,
*NL*
journalists
not
on
any
paper
,
party
leaders
without
followers
.
He
saw
*NL*
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
it
that
was
frivolous
and
absurd
.
But
he
*NL*
saw
and
recognized
an
unmistakable
growing
enthusiasm
,
uniting
all
*NL*
classes
,
with
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
sympathize
.
The
massacre
of
*NL*
men
who
were
fellow
Christians
,
and
of
the
same
Slavonic
race
,
excited
*NL*
sympathy
for
the
sufferers
and
indignation
against
the
oppressors
.
And
*NL*
the
heroism
of
the
Servians
and
Montenegrins
struggling
for
a
great
*NL*
cause
begot
in
the
whole
people
a
longing
to
help
their
brothers
not
in
*NL*
word
but
in
deed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
this
there
was
another
aspect
that
rejoiced
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
That
was
the
manifestation
of
public
opinion
.
The
public
had
definitely
*NL*
expressed
its
desire
.
The
soul
of
the
people
had
,
as
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
said
,
found
expression
.
And
the
more
he
worked
in
this
cause
,
the
more
*NL*
incontestable
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
a
cause
destined
to
assume
*NL*
vast
dimensions
,
to
create
an
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
service
of
this
great
cause
,
*NL*
and
forgot
to
think
about
his
book
.
His
whole
time
now
was
engrossed
by
*NL*
it
,
so
that
he
could
scarcely
manage
to
answer
all
the
letters
and
*NL*
appeals
addressed
to
him
.
He
worked
the
whole
spring
and
part
of
the
*NL*
summer
,
and
it
was
only
in
July
that
he
prepared
to
go
away
to
his
*NL*
brother
's
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
both
to
rest
for
a
fortnight
,
and
in
the
very
heart
of
the
*NL*
people
,
in
the
farthest
wilds
of
the
country
,
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
that
*NL*
uplifting
of
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
of
which
,
like
all
residents
in
*NL*
the
capital
and
big
towns
,
he
was
fully
persuaded
.
Katavasov
had
long
*NL*
been
meaning
to
carry
out
his
promise
to
stay
with
Levin
,
and
so
he
was
*NL*
going
with
him
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Katavasov
had
only
just
reached
the
station
of
the
*NL*
Kursk
line
,
which
was
particularly
busy
and
full
of
people
that
day
,
*NL*
when
,
looking
round
for
the
groom
who
was
following
with
their
things
,
*NL*
they
saw
a
party
of
volunteers
driving
up
in
four
cabs
.
Ladies
met
them
*NL*
with
bouquets
of
flowers
,
and
followed
by
the
rushing
crowd
they
went
*NL*
into
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
ladies
,
who
had
met
the
volunteers
,
came
out
of
the
hall
and
*NL*
addressed
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
too
come
to
see
them
off
?
''
she
asked
in
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
going
away
myself
,
princess
.
To
my
brother
's
for
a
holiday
.
Do
*NL*
you
always
see
them
off
?
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
with
a
hardly
*NL*
perceptible
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
would
be
impossible
!
''
answered
the
princess
.
``
Is
it
true
that
*NL*
eight
hundred
have
been
sent
from
us
already
?
Malvinsky
would
n't
believe
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
eight
hundred
.
If
you
reckon
those
who
have
been
sent
not
*NL*
directly
from
Moscow
,
over
a
thousand
,
''
answered
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
That
's
just
what
I
said
!
''
exclaimed
the
lady
.
``
And
it
's
true
*NL*
too
,
I
suppose
,
that
more
than
a
million
has
been
subscribed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
princess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
to
today
's
telegram
?
Beaten
the
Turks
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
I
saw
,
''
answered
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
They
were
speaking
of
the
*NL*
last
telegram
stating
that
the
Turks
had
been
for
three
days
in
*NL*
succession
beaten
at
all
points
and
put
to
flight
,
and
that
tomorrow
a
*NL*
decisive
engagement
was
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
a
splendid
young
fellow
has
asked
leave
to
go
,
and
*NL*
they
've
made
some
difficulty
,
I
do
n't
know
why
.
I
meant
to
ask
you
;
I
*NL*
know
him
;
please
write
a
note
about
his
case
.
He
's
being
sent
by
*NL*
Countess
Lidia
Ivanovna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
asked
for
all
the
details
the
princess
knew
about
the
*NL*
young
man
,
and
going
into
the
first-class
waiting-room
,
wrote
a
note
to
*NL*
the
person
on
whom
the
granting
of
leave
of
absence
depended
,
and
handed
*NL*
it
to
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Count
Vronsky
,
the
notorious
one
...
is
going
by
this
train
?
''
*NL*
said
the
princess
with
a
smile
full
of
triumph
and
meaning
,
when
he
*NL*
found
her
again
and
gave
her
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
heard
he
was
going
,
but
I
did
not
know
when
.
By
this
train
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
him
.
He
's
here
:
there
's
only
his
mother
seeing
him
off
.
It
's
*NL*
the
best
thing
,
anyway
,
that
he
could
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
the
crowd
streamed
by
them
into
the
dining
room
.
*NL*
They
went
forward
too
,
and
heard
a
gentleman
with
a
glass
in
his
hand
*NL*
delivering
a
loud
discourse
to
the
volunteers
.
``
In
the
service
of
*NL*
religion
,
humanity
,
and
our
brothers
,
''
the
gentleman
said
,
his
voice
*NL*
growing
louder
and
louder
;
``
to
this
great
cause
mother
Moscow
dedicates
*NL*
you
with
her
blessing
.
_
Jivio
!
_
''
he
concluded
,
loudly
and
tearfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
shouted
_
Jivio
!
_
and
a
fresh
crowd
dashed
into
the
hall
,
almost
*NL*
carrying
the
princess
off
her
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
princess
!
that
was
something
like
!
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
*NL*
suddenly
appearing
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd
and
beaming
upon
them
with
*NL*
a
delighted
smile
.
``
Capitally
,
warmly
said
,
was
n't
it
?
Bravo
!
And
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
!
Why
,
you
ought
to
have
said
something
--
just
a
few
words
,
you
*NL*
know
,
to
encourage
them
;
you
do
that
so
well
,
''
he
added
with
a
soft
,
*NL*
respectful
,
and
discreet
smile
,
moving
Sergey
Ivanovitch
forward
a
*NL*
little
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
just
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
country
,
to
my
brother
's
,
''
answered
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
'll
see
my
wife
.
I
've
written
to
her
,
but
you
'll
see
her
first

*NL*
Please
tell
her
that
they
've
seen
me
and
that
it
's
`
all
right
,

as
the
*NL*
English
say
.
She
'll
understand

Oh

and
be
so
good
as
to
tell
her
I

*NL*
appointed
secretary
of

But
she
'll
understand
!
You
*NL*
know
,
_
les
petites
miseres
de
la
vie
humaine
,
_
''
he
said
,
as
it
were
*NL*
apologizing
to
the
princess
.
``
And
Princess
Myakaya
--
not
Liza
,
but
*NL*
Bibish
--
is
sending
a
thousand
guns
and
twelve
nurses
.
Did
I
tell
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
heard
so
,
''
answered
Koznishev
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
you
're
going
away
,
''
said
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
``
Tomorrow
*NL*
we
're
giving
a
dinner
to
two
who
're
setting
off
--
Dimer-Bartnyansky
from
*NL*
Petersburg
and
our
Veslovsky
,
Grisha
.
They
're
both
going
.
Veslovsky
's
*NL*
only
lately
married
.
There
's
a
fine
fellow
for
you
!
Eh
,
princess
?
''
he
*NL*
turned
to
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
princess
looked
at
Koznishev
without
replying
.
But
the
fact
that
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
the
princess
seemed
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
did
*NL*
not
in
the
least
disconcert
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
.
Smiling
,
he
stared
at
*NL*
the
feather
in
the
princess
's
hat
,
and
then
about
him
as
though
he
were
*NL*
going
to
pick
something
up
.
Seeing
a
lady
approaching
with
a
collecting
*NL*
box
,
he
beckoned
her
up
and
put
in
a
five-rouble
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
see
these
collecting
boxes
unmoved
while
I
've
money
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
how
about
today
's
telegram
?
Fine
chaps
those
*NL*
Montenegrins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
he
cried
,
when
the
princess
told
him
that
Vronsky
*NL*
was
going
by
this
train
.
For
an
instant
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
's
face
*NL*
looked
sad
,
but
a
minute
later
,
when
,
stroking
his
mustaches
and
*NL*
swinging
as
he
walked
,
he
went
into
the
hall
where
Vronsky
was
,
he
had
*NL*
completely
forgotten
his
own
despairing
sobs
over
his
sister
's
corpse
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
in
Vronsky
only
a
hero
and
an
old
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
his
faults
one
ca
n't
refuse
to
do
him
justice
,
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
as
soon
as
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
had
left
*NL*
them
.
``
What
a
typically
Russian
,
Slav
nature
!
Only
,
I
'm
afraid
it
wo
n't
*NL*
be
pleasant
for
Vronsky
to
see
him
.
Say
what
you
will
,
I
'm
touched
by
*NL*
that
man
's
fate
.
Do
talk
to
him
a
little
on
the
way
,
''
said
the
princess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
,
if
it
happens
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
liked
him
.
But
this
atones
for
a
great
deal
.
He
's
not
merely
*NL*
going
himself
,
he
's
taking
a
squadron
at
his
own
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
I
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bell
sounded
.
Everyone
crowded
to
the
doors
.
``
Here
he
is
!
''
said
the
*NL*
princess
,
indicating
Vronsky
,
who
with
his
mother
on
his
arm
walked
by
,
*NL*
wearing
a
long
overcoat
and
wide-brimmed
black
hat
.
Oblonsky
was
walking
*NL*
beside
him
,
talking
eagerly
of
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
was
frowning
and
looking
straight
before
him
,
as
though
he
did
*NL*
not
hear
what
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
on
Oblonsky
's
pointing
them
out
,
he
looked
round
in
the
*NL*
direction
where
the
princess
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
were
standing
,
and
*NL*
without
speaking
lifted
his
hat
.
His
face
,
aged
and
worn
by
suffering
,
*NL*
looked
stony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
onto
the
platform
,
Vronsky
left
his
mother
and
disappeared
into
a
*NL*
compartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
platform
there
rang
out
``
God
save
the
Tsar
,
''
then
shouts
of
*NL*
``
hurrah
!
''
and
_
``
jivio
!
''
_
One
of
the
volunteers
,
a
tall
,
very
young
man
*NL*
with
a
hollow
chest
,
was
particularly
conspicuous
,
bowing
and
waving
his
*NL*
felt
hat
and
a
nosegay
over
his
head
.
Then
two
officers
emerged
,
bowing
*NL*
too
,
and
a
stout
man
with
a
big
beard
,
wearing
a
greasy
forage
cap
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Saying
good-bye
to
the
princess
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
was
joined
by
*NL*
Katavasov
;
together
they
got
into
a
carriage
full
to
overflowing
,
and
*NL*
the
train
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Tsaritsino
station
the
train
was
met
by
a
chorus
of
young
men
singing
*NL*
``
Hail
to
Thee
!
''
Again
the
volunteers
bowed
and
poked
their
heads
out
,
*NL*
but
Sergey
Ivanovitch
paid
no
attention
to
them
.
He
had
had
so
much
to
*NL*
do
with
the
volunteers
that
the
type
was
familiar
to
him
and
did
not
*NL*
interest
him
.
Katavasov
,
whose
scientific
work
had
prevented
his
having
*NL*
a
chance
of
observing
them
hitherto
,
was
very
much
interested
in
them
*NL*
and
questioned
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
advised
him
to
go
into
the
second-class
and
talk
to
*NL*
them
himself
.
At
the
next
station
Katavasov
acted
on
this
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
stop
he
moved
into
the
second-class
and
made
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
the
volunteers
.
They
were
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
carriage
,
talking
loudly
and
obviously
aware
that
the
attention
of
the
*NL*
passengers
and
Katavasov
as
he
got
in
was
concentrated
upon
them
.
More
*NL*
loudly
than
all
talked
the
tall
,
hollow-chested
young
man
.
He
was
*NL*
unmistakably
tipsy
,
and
was
relating
some
story
that
had
occurred
at
his
*NL*
school
.
Facing
him
sat
a
middle-aged
officer
in
the
Austrian
military
*NL*
jacket
of
the
Guards
uniform
.
He
was
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
*NL*
hollow-chested
youth
,
and
occasionally
pulling
him
up
.
The
third
,
in
an
*NL*
artillery
uniform
,
was
sitting
on
a
box
beside
them
.
A
fourth
was
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Entering
into
conversation
with
the
youth
,
Katavasov
learned
that
he
was
*NL*
a
wealthy
Moscow
merchant
who
had
run
through
a
large
fortune
before
he
*NL*
was
two-and-twenty
.
Katavasov
did
not
like
him
,
because
he
was
unmanly
*NL*
and
effeminate
and
sickly
.
He
was
obviously
convinced
,
especially
now
*NL*
after
drinking
,
that
he
was
performing
a
heroic
action
,
and
he
bragged
*NL*
of
it
in
the
most
unpleasant
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
,
the
retired
officer
,
made
an
unpleasant
impression
too
upon
*NL*
Katavasov
.
He
was
,
it
seemed
,
a
man
who
had
tried
everything
.
He
had
*NL*
been
on
a
railway
,
had
been
a
land-steward
,
and
had
started
factories
,
*NL*
and
he
talked
,
quite
without
necessity
,
of
all
he
had
done
,
and
used
*NL*
learned
expressions
quite
inappropriately
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
,
the
artilleryman
,
on
the
contrary
,
struck
Katavasov
very
*NL*
favorably
.
He
was
a
quiet
,
modest
fellow
,
unmistakably
impressed
by
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
officer
and
the
heroic
self-sacrifice
of
the
merchant
*NL*
and
saying
nothing
about
himself
.
When
Katavasov
asked
him
what
had
*NL*
impelled
him
to
go
to
Servia
,
he
answered
modestly

*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
everyone
's
going

The
Servians
want
help
,
too

I
'm
sorry
for
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
artillerymen
especially
are
scarce
there
,
''
said
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
was
n't
long
in
the
artillery
,
maybe
they
'll
put
me
into
the
*NL*
infantry
or
the
cavalry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
the
infantry
when
they
need
artillery
more
than
anything
?
''
said
*NL*
Katavasov
,
fancying
from
the
artilleryman
's
apparent
age
that
he
must
*NL*
have
reached
a
fairly
high
grade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
long
in
the
artillery
;
I
'm
a
cadet
retired
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
*NL*
began
to
explain
how
he
had
failed
in
his
examination
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
this
together
made
a
disagreeable
impression
on
Katavasov
,
and
*NL*
when
the
volunteers
got
out
at
a
station
for
a
drink
,
Katavasov
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
compare
his
unfavorable
impression
in
conversation
with
*NL*
someone
.
There
was
an
old
man
in
the
carriage
,
wearing
a
military
*NL*
overcoat
,
who
had
been
listening
all
the
while
to
Katavasov
's
*NL*
conversation
with
the
volunteers
.
When
they
were
left
alone
,
Katavasov
*NL*
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
different
positions
they
come
from
,
all
those
fellows
who
are
*NL*
going
off
there
,
''
Katavasov
said
vaguely
,
not
wishing
to
express
his
own
*NL*
opinion
,
and
at
the
same
time
anxious
to
find
out
the
old
man
's
views
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
was
an
officer
who
had
served
on
two
campaigns
.
He
knew
what
*NL*
makes
a
soldier
,
and
judging
by
the
appearance
and
the
talk
of
those
*NL*
persons
,
by
the
swagger
with
which
they
had
recourse
to
the
bottle
on
*NL*
the
journey
,
he
considered
them
poor
soldiers
.
Moreover
,
he
lived
in
a
*NL*
district
town
,
and
he
was
longing
to
tell
how
one
soldier
had
*NL*
volunteered
from
his
town
,
a
drunkard
and
a
thief
whom
no
one
would
*NL*
employ
as
a
laborer
.
But
knowing
by
experience
that
in
the
present
*NL*
condition
of
the
public
temper
it
was
dangerous
to
express
an
opinion
*NL*
opposed
to
the
general
one
,
and
especially
to
criticize
the
volunteers
*NL*
unfavorably
,
he
too
watched
Katavasov
without
committing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
men
are
wanted
there
,
''
he
said
,
laughing
with
his
eyes
.
And
they
*NL*
fell
to
talking
of
the
last
war
news
,
and
each
concealed
from
the
other
*NL*
his
perplexity
as
to
the
engagement
expected
next
day
,
since
the
Turks
*NL*
had
been
beaten
,
according
to
the
latest
news
,
at
all
points
.
And
so
*NL*
they
parted
,
neither
giving
expression
to
his
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Katavasov
went
back
to
his
own
carriage
,
and
with
reluctant
hypocrisy
*NL*
reported
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
his
observations
of
the
volunteers
,
from
*NL*
which
it
would
appear
that
they
were
capital
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
big
station
at
a
town
the
volunteers
were
again
greeted
with
shouts
*NL*
and
singing
,
again
men
and
women
with
collecting
boxes
appeared
,
and
*NL*
provincial
ladies
brought
bouquets
to
the
volunteers
and
followed
them
*NL*
into
the
refreshment
room
;
but
all
this
was
on
a
much
smaller
and
*NL*
feebler
scale
than
in
Moscow
.

*NL*
While
the
train
was
stopping
at
the
provincial
town
,
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
did
not
go
to
the
refreshment
room
,
but
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
he
passed
Vronsky
's
compartment
he
noticed
that
the
*NL*
curtain
was
drawn
over
the
window
;
but
as
he
passed
it
the
second
time
*NL*
he
saw
the
old
countess
at
the
window
.
She
beckoned
to
Koznishev
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
,
you
see
,
taking
him
as
far
as
Kursk
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
so
I
heard
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
standing
at
her
window
and
*NL*
peeping
in
.
``
What
a
noble
act
on
his
part
!
''
he
added
,
noticing
that
*NL*
Vronsky
was
not
in
the
compartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
after
his
misfortune
,
what
was
there
for
him
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
terrible
thing
it
was
!
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
I
have
been
through
!
But
do
get
in
...
Ah
,
what
I
have
been
*NL*
through
!
''
she
repeated
,
when
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
got
in
and
sat
down
*NL*
beside
her
.
``
You
ca
n't
conceive
it
!
For
six
weeks
he
did
not
speak
to
*NL*
anyone
,
and
would
not
touch
food
except
when
I
implored
him
.
And
not
for
*NL*
one
minute
could
we
leave
him
alone
.
We
took
away
everything
he
could
*NL*
have
used
against
himself
.
We
lived
on
the
ground
floor
,
but
there
was
*NL*
no
reckoning
on
anything
.
You
know
,
of
course
,
that
he
had
shot
himself
*NL*
once
already
on
her
account
,
''
she
said
,
and
the
old
lady
's
eyelashes
*NL*
twitched
at
the
recollection
.
``
Yes
,
hers
was
the
fitting
end
for
such
a
*NL*
woman
.
Even
the
death
she
chose
was
low
and
vulgar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
for
us
to
judge
,
countess
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
;
``
but
I
can
*NL*
understand
that
it
has
been
very
hard
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
speak
of
it
!
I
was
staying
on
my
estate
,
and
he
was
with
me
.
*NL*
A
note
was
brought
him
.
He
wrote
an
answer
and
sent
it
off
.
We
had
n't
an
*NL*
idea
that
she
was
close
by
at
the
station
.
In
the
evening
I
had
only
*NL*
just
gone
to
my
room
,
when
my
Mary
told
me
a
lady
had
thrown
herself
*NL*
under
the
train
.
Something
seemed
to
strike
me
at
once
.
I
knew
it
was
*NL*
she
.
The
first
thing
I
said
was
,
he
was
not
to
be
told
.
But
they
'd
told
*NL*
him
already
.
His
coachman
was
there
and
saw
it
all
.
When
I
ran
into
his
*NL*
room
,
he
was
beside
himself
--
it
was
fearful
to
see
him
.
He
did
n't
say
a
*NL*
word
,
but
galloped
off
there
.
I
do
n't
know
to
this
day
what
happened
*NL*
there
,
but
he
was
brought
back
at
death
's
door
.
I
should
n't
have
known
*NL*
him
.
_
Prostration
complete
,
_
the
doctor
said
.
And
that
was
followed
*NL*
almost
by
madness
.
Oh
,
why
talk
of
it
!
''
said
the
countess
with
a
wave
of
*NL*
her
hand
.
``
It
was
an
awful
time
!
No
,
say
what
you
will
,
she
was
a
bad
*NL*
woman
.
Why
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
such
desperate
passions
?
It
was
all
*NL*
to
show
herself
something
out
of
the
way
.
Well
,
and
that
she
did
do
.
She
*NL*
brought
herself
to
ruin
and
two
good
men
--
her
husband
and
my
unhappy
*NL*
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
her
husband
do
?
''
asked
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
taken
her
daughter
.
Alexey
was
ready
to
agree
to
anything
at
*NL*
first
.
Now
it
worries
him
terribly
that
he
should
have
given
his
own
*NL*
child
away
to
another
man
.
But
he
ca
n't
take
back
his
word
.
Karenin
came
*NL*
to
the
funeral
.
But
we
tried
to
prevent
his
meeting
Alexey
.
For
him
,
for
*NL*
her
husband
,
it
was
easier
,
anyway
.
She
had
set
him
free
.
But
my
poor
*NL*
son
was
utterly
given
up
to
her
.
He
had
thrown
up
everything
,
his
*NL*
career
,
me
,
and
even
then
she
had
no
mercy
on
him
,
but
of
set
purpose
*NL*
she
made
his
ruin
complete
.
No
,
say
what
you
will
,
her
very
death
was
*NL*
the
death
of
a
vile
woman
,
of
no
religious
feeling
.
God
forgive
me
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
hating
the
memory
of
her
,
when
I
look
at
my
son
's
misery
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
he
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
blessing
from
Providence
for
us

this
Servian
war

I
'm
old

*NL*
and
I
do
n't
understand
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
it
,
but
it
's
come
as
a
*NL*
providential
blessing
to
him

Of
course
for
me
,
as
his
mother
,
it
's
*NL*
terrible
;
and
what
's
worse

they
say

But
it
ca

be

It
was
the
one
thing
that
could
*NL*
rouse
him

Yashvin

a
friend
of
his

he
had
lost
all
he
had
at
cards
and
*NL*
he
was
going
to
Servia

He
came
to
see
him
and
persuaded
him
to
go
.
Now
*NL*
it
's
an
interest
for
him

Do
please
talk
to
him
a
little
.
I
want
to
*NL*
distract
his
mind

He
's
so
low-spirited

And
as
bad
luck
would
have
it
,
*NL*
he
has
toothache
too
.
But
he
'll
be
delighted
to
see
you

Please
do
talk
*NL*
to
him
;
he
's
walking
up

down
on
that
side

Sergey
Ivanovitch
said
he
would
be
very
glad

crossed
over
to

other
side

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
slanting
evening
shadows
cast
by
the
baggage
piled
up
on
the
*NL*
platform
,
Vronsky
in
his
long
overcoat
and
slouch
hat
,
with
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
,
strode
up
and
down
,
like
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
,
turning
*NL*
sharply
after
twenty
paces
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
fancied
,
as
he
approached
*NL*
him
,
that
Vronsky
saw
him
but
was
pretending
not
to
see
.
This
did
not
*NL*
affect
Sergey
Ivanovitch
in
the
slightest
.
He
was
above
all
personal
*NL*
considerations
with
Vronsky
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Sergey
Ivanovitch
looked
upon
Vronsky
as
a
man
taking
an
*NL*
important
part
in
a
great
cause
,
and
Koznishev
thought
it
his
duty
to
*NL*
encourage
him
and
express
his
approval
.
He
went
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vronsky
stood
still
,
looked
intently
at
him
,
recognized
him
,
and
going
a
*NL*
few
steps
forward
to
meet
him
,
shook
hands
with
him
very
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
you
did
n't
wish
to
see
me
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
``
but
*NL*
could
n't
I
be
of
use
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
I
should
less
dislike
seeing
than
you

''
said
Vronsky
.
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
;
and
there
's
nothing
in
life
for
me
to
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
,
and
I
merely
meant
to
offer
you
my
services
,
''
said
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
scanning
Vronsky
's
face
,
full
of
unmistakable
*NL*
suffering
.
``
Would
n't
it
be
of
use
to
you
to
have
a
letter
to
*NL*
Ristitch
--
to
Milan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

Vronsky
said
,
seeming
to
understand
him
with
difficulty
.
``
If
*NL*
you
do
n't
mind
,
let
's
walk
on

It
's
so
stuffy
among
the
carriages
.
A
*NL*
letter
?
No
,
thank
you
;
to
meet
death
one
needs
no
letters
of
*NL*
introduction
.
Nor
for
the
Turks
...
''
he
said
,
with
a
smile
that
was
*NL*
merely
of
the
lips
.
His
eyes
still
kept
their
look
of
angry
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
you
might
find
it
easier
to
get
into
relations
,
which
are
*NL*
after
all
essential
,
with
anyone
prepared
to
see
you
.
But
that
's
as
you
*NL*
like
.
I
was
very
glad
to
hear
of
your
intention
.
There
have
been
so
many
*NL*
attacks
made
on
the
volunteers
,
and
a
man
like
you
raises
them
in
public
*NL*
estimation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
use
as
a
man
,
''
said
Vronsky
,
``
is
that
life
's
worth
nothing
to
me
.
*NL*
And
that
I
've
enough
bodily
energy
to
cut
my
way
into
their
ranks
,
and
*NL*
to
trample
on
them
or
fall
--
I
know
that
.
I
'm
glad
there
's
something
to
*NL*
give
my
life
for
,
for
it
's
not
simply
useless
but
loathsome
to
me
.
*NL*
Anyone
's
welcome
to
it
.
''
And
his
jaw
twitched
impatiently
from
the
*NL*
incessant
gnawing
toothache
,
that
prevented
him
from
even
speaking
with
*NL*
a
natural
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
become
another
man
,
I
predict
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
*NL*
feeling
touched
.
``
To
deliver
one

brother-men
from
bondage
is
an
aim

worth
death
and
life
.
God
grant
you
success
outwardly
--
and
inwardly
*NL*
peace
,
''
he
added
,
and
he
held
out
his
hand
.
Vronsky
warmly
pressed
his
*NL*
outstretched
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
as
a
weapon
I
may
be
of
some
use
.
But
as
a
man
,
I
'm
a
wreck
,
''
he
*NL*
jerked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hardly
speak
for
the
throbbing
ache
in
his
strong
teeth
,
that
*NL*
were
like
rows
of
ivory
in
his
mouth
.
He
was
silent
,
and
his
eyes
rested
*NL*
on
the
wheels
of
the
tender
,
slowly
and
smoothly
rolling
along
the
*NL*
rails
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
at
once
a
different
pain
,
not
an
ache
,
but
an
inner
trouble
,
*NL*
that
set
his
whole
being
in
anguish
,
made
him
for
an
instant
forget
his
*NL*
toothache
.
As
he
glanced
at
the
tender
and
the
rails
,
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
the
conversation
with
a
friend
he
had
not
met
since
his
*NL*
misfortune
,
he
suddenly
recalled
_
her
_
--
that
is
,
what
was
left
of
her
*NL*
when
he
had
run
like
one
distraught
into
the
cloak
room
of
the
railway
*NL*
station
--
on
the
table
,
shamelessly
sprawling
out
among
strangers
,
the
*NL*
bloodstained
body
so
lately
full
of
life
;
the
head
unhurt
dropping
back
*NL*
with
its
weight
of
hair
,
and
the
curling
tresses
about
the
temples
,
and
*NL*
the
exquisite
face
,
with
red
,
half-opened
mouth
,
the
strange
,
fixed
*NL*
expression
,
piteous
on
the
lips
and
awful
in
the
still
open
eyes
,
that
*NL*
seemed
to
utter
that
fearful
phrase
--
that
he
would
be
sorry
for
it
--
that
*NL*
she
had
said
when
they
were
quarreling
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tried
to
think
of
her
as
she
was
when
he
met
her
the
first
time
,
*NL*
at
a
railway
station
too
,
mysterious
,
exquisite
,
loving
,
seeking
and
*NL*
giving
happiness
,
and
not
cruelly
revengeful
as
he
remembered
her
on
*NL*
that
last
moment
.
He
tried
to
recall
his
best
moments
with
her
,
but
*NL*
those
moments
were
poisoned
forever
.
He
could
only
think
of
her
as
*NL*
triumphant
,
successful
in
her
menace
of
a
wholly
useless
remorse
never
*NL*
to
be
effaced
.
He
lost
all
consciousness
of
toothache
,
and
his
face
*NL*
worked
with
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
twice
up
and
down
beside
the
baggage
in
silence
and
regaining
*NL*
his
self-possession
,
he
addressed
Sergey
Ivanovitch
calmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
no
telegrams
since
yesterday
's
?
Yes
,
driven
back
for
a
*NL*
third
time
,
but
a
decisive
engagement
expected
for
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
talking
a
little
more
of
King
Milan
's
proclamation
,
and
the
*NL*
immense
effect
it
might
have
,
they
parted
,
going
to
their
carriages
on
*NL*
hearing
the
second
bell
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
had
not
telegraphed
to
his
brother
to
send
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
as
he
did
not
know
when
he
should
be
able
to
leave
Moscow
.
Levin
*NL*
was
not
at
home
when
Katavasov
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
in
a
fly
hired
at
*NL*
the
station
drove
up
to
the
steps
of
the
Pokrovskoe
house
,
as
black
as
*NL*
Moors
from
the
dust
of
the
road
.
Kitty
,
sitting
on
the
balcony
with
her
*NL*
father
and
sister
,
recognized
her
brother-in-law
,
and
ran
down
to
meet
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
shame
not
to
have
let
us
know
,
''
she
said
,
giving
her
hand
to
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
putting
her
forehead
up
for
him
to
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
drove
here
capitally
,
and
have
not
put
you
out
,
''
answered
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
.
``
I
'm
so
dirty
.
I
'm
afraid
to
touch
you
.
I
've
been
so
busy
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
know
when
I
should
be
able
to
tear
myself
away
.
And
so
you
're
*NL*
still
as
ever
enjoying
your
peaceful
,
quiet
happiness
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
smiling
,
``
out
of
the
reach
of
the
current
in
your
peaceful
backwater
.
*NL*
Here
's
our
friend
Fyodor
Vassilievitch
who
has
succeeded
in
getting
here
*NL*
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
not
a
negro
,
I
shall
look
like
a
human
being
when
I
wash
,
''
said
*NL*
Katavasov
in
his
jesting
fashion
,
and
he
shook
hands
and
smiled
,
his
*NL*
teeth
flashing
white
in
his
black
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
will
be
delighted

He
has
gone

It

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Busy
as
ever
with
his
farming

It
really
is
a
peaceful
backwater

said
*NL*
Katavasov
;
``
while
we
in
town
think
of
nothing
but
the
Servian
war

Well
,
*NL*
how
does
our

look
at
it
?
He
's
sure
not
to
think
like
other
*NL*
people

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
like
everybody
else

Kitty
answered
,
a
little
*NL*
embarrassed
,
looking
round
at
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
``
I
'll
send
to
fetch
*NL*
him

Papa

staying
with
us

He
's
only
just
come
home
from
abroad

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
making
arrangements
to
send
for
Levin
and
for
the
guests
to
wash
,
*NL*
one
in
his
room
and
the
other
in
what
had
been
Dolly
's
,
and
giving
*NL*
orders
for
their
luncheon
,
Kitty
ran
out
onto
the
balcony
,
enjoying
the
*NL*
freedom
,
and
rapidity
of
movement
,
of
which
she
had
been
deprived
during
*NL*
the
months
of
her
pregnancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Katavasov
,
a
professor

''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
a
bore
in
this
heat

said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

papa
,
he
's
very
nice
,
and
Kostya
's
very
fond
of
him
,
''
Kitty
said
,
*NL*
with
a
deprecating
smile
,
noticing
the
irony
on
her
father
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
say
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
to
them

''
said
Kitty
to
her
sister
,
``
and
entertain
*NL*
them
.
They
saw
Stiva
at
the
station
;
he
was
quite
well
.
And
I
must
run
*NL*
to
Mitya
.
As
ill-luck
would
have
it
,
I
have
n't
fed
him
since
tea
.
He
's
*NL*
awake
now
,
and
sure
to
be
screaming
.
''
And
feeling
a
rush
of
milk
,
she
*NL*
hurried
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
a
mere
guess
;
her
connection
with
the
child
was
still
so
*NL*
close
,
that
she
could
gauge
by
the
flow
of
her
milk
his
need
of
food
,
*NL*
and
knew
for
certain
he
was
hungry
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
he
was
crying
before
she
reached
the
nursery
.
And
he
was
indeed
*NL*
crying
.
She
heard
him
and
hastened
.
But
the
faster
she
went
,
the
louder
*NL*
he
screamed
.
It
was
a
fine
healthy
scream
,
hungry
and
impatient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
been
screaming
long
,
nurse
,
very
long
?
''
said
Kitty
hurriedly
,
*NL*
seating
herself
on
a
chair
,
and
preparing
to
give
the
baby
the
breast
.
*NL*
``
But
give
me
him
quickly
.
Oh
,
nurse
,
how
tiresome
you
are
!
There
,
tie
*NL*
the
cap
afterwards
,
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baby
's
greedy
scream
was
passing
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
manage
so
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
who
was
almost
*NL*
always
to
be
found
in
the
nursery
.
``
He
must
be
put
straight
.
A-oo
!
*NL*
a-oo
!
''
she
chanted
over
him
,
paying
no
attention
to
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nurse
brought
the
baby
to
his
mother
.
Agafea
Mihalovna
followed
him
*NL*
with
a
face
dissolving
with
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
me
,
he
knows
me

In
God
's
faith
,
Katerina
Alexandrovna
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
he
knew
me
!
''
Agafea
Mihalovna
cried
above
the
baby
's
screams
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kitty
did
not
hear
her
words
.
Her
impatience
kept
growing
,
like
the
*NL*
baby
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
impatience
hindered
things
for
a
while
.
The
baby
could
not
get
*NL*
hold
of
the
breast
right
,
and
was
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
after
despairing
,
breathless
screaming
,
and
vain
sucking
,
*NL*
things
went
right
,
and
mother
and
child
felt
simultaneously
soothed
,
and
*NL*
both
subsided
into
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
poor
darling
,
he
's
all
in
perspiration
!
''
said
Kitty
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
touching
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
he
knows
you
?
''
she
added
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
*NL*
at
the
baby
's
eyes
,
that
peered
roguishly
,
as
she
fancied
,
from
under
*NL*
his
cap
,
at
his
rhythmically
puffing
cheeks
,
and
the
little
red-palmed
*NL*
hand
he
was
waving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
If
he
knew
anyone
,
he
would
have
known
me
,
''
said
Kitty
,
in
*NL*
response
to
Agafea
Mihalovna
's
statement
,
and
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
because
,
though
she
said
he
could
not
know
her
,
in
her
heart
*NL*
she
was
sure
that
he
knew
not
merely
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
but
that
he
knew
*NL*
and
understood
everything
,
and
knew
and
understood
a
great
deal
too
that
*NL*
no
one
else
knew
,
and
that
she
,
his
mother
,
had
learned
and
come
to
*NL*
understand
only
through
him
.
To
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
to
the
nurse
,
to
his
*NL*
grandfather
,
to
his
father
even
,
Mitya
was
a
living
being
,
requiring
*NL*
only
material
care
,
but
for
his
mother
he
had
long
been
a
mortal
being
,
*NL*
with
whom
there
had
been
a
whole
series
of
spiritual
relations
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
he
wakes
up
,
please
God
,
you
shall
see
for
yourself
.
Then
when
I
*NL*
do
like
this
,
he
simply
beams
on
me
,
the
darling
!
Simply
beams
like
a
*NL*
sunny
day

said
Agafea
Mihalovna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
;
then
we
shall
see
,
''
whispered
Kitty
.
``
But
now
go
away

he
's
*NL*
going
to
sleep

Chapter
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Agafea
Mihalovna
went
out
on
tiptoe
;
the
nurse
let
down
the
blind
,
*NL*
chased
a
fly
out
from
under
the
muslin
canopy
of
the
crib
,
and
a
*NL*
bumblebee
struggling
on
the
window-frame
,
and
sat
down
waving
a
faded
*NL*
branch
of
birch
over
the
mother
and
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
hot
it
is
!
if
God
would
send
a
drop
of
rain
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
sh
--
sh
--
sh
--
''
was
all
Kitty
answered
,
rocking
a
little
,
and
*NL*
tenderly
squeezing
the
plump
little
arm
,
with
rolls
of
fat
at
the
wrist
,
*NL*
which
Mitya
still
waved
feebly
as
he
opened
and
shut
his
eyes
.
That
hand
*NL*
worried
Kitty
;
she
longed
to
kiss
the
little
hand
,
but
was
afraid
to
for
*NL*
fear
of
waking
the
baby
.
At
last
the
little
hand
ceased
waving
,
and
the
*NL*
eyes
closed
.
Only
from
time
to
time
,
as
he
went
on
sucking
,
the
baby
*NL*
raised
his
long
,
curly
eyelashes
and
peeped
at
his
mother
with
wet
eyes
,
*NL*
that
looked
black
in
the
twilight
.
The
nurse
had
left
off
fanning
,
and
*NL*
was
dozing
.
From
above
came
the
peals
of
the
old
prince
's
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
chuckle
of
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
got
into
talk
without
me
,
''
thought
Kitty
,
``
but
still
it
's
*NL*
vexing
that
Kostya
's
out
.
He
's
sure
to
have
gone
to
the
bee
house
again
.
*NL*
Though
it
's
a
pity
he
's
there
so
often
,
still
I
'm
glad
.
It
distracts
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
's
become
altogether
happier
and
better
now
than
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
He
used
to
be
so
gloomy
and
worried
that
I
felt
frightened
for
him
.
And
*NL*
how
absurd
he
is
!
''
she
whispered
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
what
worried
her
husband
.
It
was
his
unbelief
.
Although
,
if
she
*NL*
had
been
asked
whether
she
supposed
that
in
the
future
life
,
if
he
did
*NL*
not
believe
,
he
would
be
damned
,
she
would
have
had
to
admit
that
he
*NL*
would
be
damned
,
his
unbelief
did
not
cause
her
unhappiness
.
And
she
,
*NL*
confessing
that
for
an
unbeliever
there
can
be
no
salvation
,
and
loving
*NL*
her
husband
's
soul
more
than
anything
in
the
world
,
thought
with
a
smile
*NL*
of
his
unbelief
,
and
told
herself
that
he
was
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
he
keep
reading
philosophy
of
some
sort
for
all
this
year
?
''
*NL*
she
wondered
.
``
If
it
's
all
written
in
those
books
,
he
can
understand
*NL*
them
.
If
it
's
all
wrong
,
why
does
he
read
them
?
He
says
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
like
to
believe
.
Then
why
is
it
he
does
n't
believe
?
Surely
from
*NL*
his
thinking
so
much
?
And
he
thinks
so
much
from
being
solitary
.
He
's
*NL*
always
alone
,
alone
.
He
ca
n't
talk
about
it
all
to
us
.
I
fancy
he
'll
be
*NL*
glad
of
these
visitors
,
especially
Katavasov
.
He
likes
discussions
with
*NL*
them
,
''
she
thought
,
and
passed
instantly
to
the
consideration
of
where
*NL*
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
put
Katavasov
,
to
sleep
alone
or
to
share
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
room
.
And
then
an
idea
suddenly
struck
her
,
which
*NL*
made
her
shudder
and
even
disturb
Mitya
,
who
glanced
severely
at
her
.
``
I
*NL*
do
believe
the
laundress
has
n't
sent
the
washing
yet
,
and
all
the
best
*NL*
sheets
are
in
use
.
If
I
do
n't
see
to
it
,
Agafea
Mihalovna
will
give
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
the
wrong
sheets
,
''
and
at
the
very
idea
of
this
the
*NL*
blood
rushed
to
Kitty
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
arrange
it
,
''
she
decided
,
and
going
back
to
her
former
*NL*
thoughts
,
she
remembered
that
some
spiritual
question
of
importance
had
*NL*
been
interrupted
,
and
she
began
to
recall
what
.
``
Yes
,
Kostya
,
an
*NL*
unbeliever
,
''
she
thought
again
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
an
unbeliever
then
!
Better
let
him
always
be
one
than
like
Madame
*NL*
Stahl
,
or
what
I
tried
to
be
in
those
days
abroad
.
No
,
he
wo
n't
ever
*NL*
sham
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
recent
instance
of
his
goodness
rose
vividly
to
her
mind
.
A
*NL*
fortnight
ago
a
penitent
letter
had
come
from
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
to
*NL*
Dolly
.
He
besought
her
to
save
his
honor
,
to
sell
her
estate
to
pay

debts

Dolly
was
in
despair
,
she
detested
her
husband
,
despised
him
,
*NL*
pitied
him
,
resolved
on
a
separation
,
resolved
to
refuse
,
but
ended
by
*NL*
agreeing
to
sell
part
of
her
property
.
After
that
,
with
an
irrepressible
*NL*
smile
of
tenderness
,
Kitty
recalled
her
husband
's
shamefaced
*NL*
embarrassment
,
his
repeated
awkward
efforts
to
approach
the
subject
,
and
*NL*
how
at
last
,
having
thought
of
the
one
means
of
helping
Dolly
without
*NL*
wounding
her
pride
,
he
had
suggested
to
Kitty
--
what
had
not
occurred
to
*NL*
her
before
--
that
she
should
give
up
her
share
of
the
property
.

``
He
an
unbeliever
indeed

With
his

his

offending

Everything
for
others

nothing
for
himself

Sergey

considers
it
as

And
*NL*
it

the

with
his

Now
Dolly
and
her
children
are
under
his

guardianship

these

Chapter
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
,
by
his
beloved
brother
's
deathbed
,
Levin
had
first
glanced
*NL*
into
the
questions
of
life
and
death
in
the
light
of
these
new
*NL*
convictions
,
as
he
called
them
,
which
had
during
the
period
from
his
*NL*
twentieth
to
his
thirty-fourth
year
imperceptibly
replaced
his
childish
*NL*
and
youthful
beliefs
--
he
had
been
stricken
with
horror
,
not
so
much
of
*NL*
death
,
as
of
life
,
without
any
knowledge
of
whence
,
and
why
,
and
how
,
*NL*
and
what
it
was
.
The
physical
organization
,
its
decay
,
the
*NL*
indestructibility
of
matter
,
the
law
of
the
conservation
of
energy
,
*NL*
evolution
,
were
the
words
which
usurped
the
place
of
his
old
belief
.
*NL*
These
words
and
the
ideas
associated
with
them
were
very
well
for
*NL*
intellectual
purposes
.
But
for
life
they
yielded
nothing
,
and
Levin
felt
*NL*
suddenly
like
a
man
who
has
changed
his
warm
fur
cloak
for
a
muslin
*NL*
garment
,
and
going
for
the
first
time
into
the
frost
is
immediately
*NL*
convinced
,
not
by
reason
,
but
by
his
whole
nature
that
he
is
as
good
as
*NL*
naked
,
and
that
he
must
infallibly
perish
miserably
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
,
though
he
did
not
distinctly
face
it
,
and
still
went
*NL*
on
living
as
before
,
Levin
had
never
lost
this
sense
of
terror
at
his
*NL*
lack
of
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
vaguely
felt
,
too
,
that
what
he
called
his
new
convictions
were
not
*NL*
merely
lack
of
knowledge
,
but
that
they
were
part
of
a
whole
order
of
*NL*
ideas
,
in
which
no
knowledge
of
what
he
needed
was
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
marriage
,
with
the
new
joys
and
duties
bound
up
with
it
,
had
*NL*
completely
crowded
out
these
thoughts
.
But
of
late
,
while
he
was
staying
*NL*
in
Moscow
after
his
wife
's
confinement
,
with
nothing
to
do
,
the
question
*NL*
that
clamored
for
solution
had
more
and
more
often
,
more
and
more
*NL*
insistently
,
haunted
Levin
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
summed
up
for
him
thus
:
``
If
I
do
not
accept
the
answers
*NL*
Christianity
gives
to
the
problems
of
my
life
,
what
answers
do
I
*NL*
accept
?
''
And
in
the
whole
arsenal
of
his
convictions
,
so
far
from
*NL*
finding
any
satisfactory
answers
,
he
was
utterly
unable
to
find
anything
*NL*
at
all
like
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
position
of
a
man
seeking
food
in
toy
shops
and
tool
*NL*
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instinctively
,
unconsciously
,
with
every
book
,
with
every
conversation
,
*NL*
with
every
man
he
met
,
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
light
on
these
*NL*
questions
and
their
solution
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
puzzled
and
distracted
him
above
everything
was
that
the
majority
*NL*
of
men
of
his
age
and
circle
had
,
like
him
,
exchanged
their
old
beliefs
*NL*
for
the
same
new
convictions
,
and
yet
saw
nothing
to
lament
in
this
,
and
*NL*
were
perfectly
satisfied
and
serene
.
So
that
,
apart
from
the
principal
*NL*
question
,
Levin
was
tortured
by
other
questions
too
.
Were
these
people
*NL*
sincere
?
he
asked
himself
,
or
were
they
playing
a
part
?
or
was
it
that
*NL*
they
understood
the
answers
science
gave
to
these
problems
in
some
*NL*
different
,
clearer
sense
than
he
did
?
And
he
assiduously
studied
both
*NL*
these
men
's
opinions
and
the
books
which
treated
of
these
scientific
*NL*
explanations
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
fact
he
had
found
out
since
these
questions
had
engrossed
his
mind
,
*NL*
was
that
he
had
been
quite
wrong
in
supposing
from
the
recollections
of
*NL*
the
circle
of
his
young
days
at
college
,
that
religion
had
outlived
its
*NL*
day
,
and
that
it
was
now
practically
non-existent
.
All
the
people
*NL*
nearest
to
him
who
were
good
in
their
lives
were
believers
.
The
old
*NL*
prince
,
and
Lvov
,
whom
he
liked
so
much
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
all
*NL*
the
women
believed
,
and
his
wife
believed
as
simply
as
he
had
believed
*NL*
in
his
earliest
childhood
,
and
ninety-nine
hundredths
of
the
Russian
*NL*
people
,
all
the
working
people
for
whose
life
he
felt
the
deepest
*NL*
respect
,
believed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
fact
of
which
he
became
convinced
,
after
reading
many
scientific
*NL*
books
,
was
that
the
men
who
shared
his
views
had
no
other
construction
*NL*
to
put
on
them
,
and
that
they
gave
no
explanation
of
the
questions
which
*NL*
he
felt
he
could
not
live
without
answering
,
but
simply
ignored
their
*NL*
existence
and
attempted
to
explain
other
questions
of
no
possible
*NL*
interest
to
him
,
such
as
the
evolution
of
organisms
,
the
materialistic
*NL*
theory
of
consciousness
,
and
so
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
during
his
wife
's
confinement
,
something
had
happened
that
*NL*
seemed
extraordinary
to
him
.
He
,
an
unbeliever
,
had
fallen
into
praying
,
*NL*
and
at
the
moment
he
prayed
,
he
believed
.
But
that
moment
had
passed
,
*NL*
and
he
could
not
make
his
state
of
mind
at
that
moment
fit
into
the
rest
*NL*
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
admit
that
at
that
moment
he
knew
the
truth
,
and
that
now
*NL*
he
was
wrong
;
for
as
soon
as
he
began
thinking
calmly
about
it
,
it
all
*NL*
fell
to
pieces
.
He
could
not
admit
that
he
was
mistaken
then
,
for
his
*NL*
spiritual
condition
then
was
precious
to
him
,
and
to
admit
that
it
was
a
*NL*
proof
of
weakness
would
have
been
to
desecrate
those
moments
.
He
was
*NL*
miserably
divided
against
himself
,
and
strained
all
his
spiritual
forces
*NL*
to
the
utmost
to
escape
from
this
condition
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
doubts
fretted
and
harassed
him
,
growing
weaker
or
stronger
from
*NL*
time
to
time
,
but
never
leaving
him
.
He
read
and
thought
,
and
the
more
*NL*
he
read
and
the
more
he
thought
,
the
further
he
felt
from
the
aim
he
was
*NL*
pursuing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
late
in
Moscow
and
in
the
country
,
since
he
had
become
convinced
that
*NL*
he
would
find
no
solution
in
the
materialists
,
he
had
read
and
re-read
*NL*
thoroughly
Plato
,
Spinoza
,
Kant
,
Schelling
,
Hegel
,
and
Schopenhauer
,
the
*NL*
philosophers
who
gave
a
non-materialistic
explanation
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
ideas
seemed
to
him
fruitful
when
he
was
reading
or
was
himself
*NL*
seeking
arguments
to
refute
other
theories
,
especially
those
of
the
*NL*
materialists
;
but
as
soon
as
he
began
to
read
or
sought
for
himself
a
*NL*
solution
of
problems
,
the
same
thing
always
happened
.
As
long
as
he
*NL*
followed
the
fixed
definition
of
obscure
words
such
as
_
spirit
,
will
,
*NL*
freedom
,
essence
,
_
purposely
letting
himself
go
into
the
snare
of
words
*NL*
the
philosophers
set
for
him
,
he
seemed
to
comprehend
something
.
But
he
*NL*
had
only
to
forget
the
artificial
train
of
reasoning
,
and
to
turn
from
*NL*
life
itself
to
what
had
satisfied
him
while
thinking
in
accordance
with
*NL*
the
fixed
definitions
,
and
all
this
artificial
edifice
fell
to
pieces
at
*NL*
once
like
a
house
of
cards
,
and
it
became
clear
that
the
edifice
had
*NL*
been
built
up
out
of
those
transposed
words
,
apart
from
anything
in
life
*NL*
more
important
than
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
time
,
reading
Schopenhauer
,
he
put
in
place
of
his
will
the
word
*NL*
_
love
_
,
and
for
a
couple
of
days
this
new
philosophy
charmed
him
,
till
*NL*
he
removed
a
little
away
from
it
.
But
then
,
when
he
turned
from
life
*NL*
itself
to
glance
at
it
again
,
it
fell
away
too
,
and
proved
to
be
the
*NL*
same
muslin
garment
with
no
warmth
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
Sergey
Ivanovitch
advised
him
to
read
the
theological
works
*NL*
of
Homiakov
.
Levin
read
the
second
volume
of
Homiakov
's
works
,
and
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
elegant
,
epigrammatic
,
argumentative
style
which
at
first
*NL*
repelled
him
,
he
was
impressed
by
the
doctrine
of
the
church
he
found
in
*NL*
them
.
He
was
struck
at
first
by
the
idea
that
the
apprehension
of
divine
*NL*
truths
had
not
been
vouchsafed
to
man
,
but
to
a
corporation
of
men
bound
*NL*
together
by
love
--
to
the
church
.
What
delighted
him
was
the
thought
how
*NL*
much
easier
it
was
to
believe
in
a
still
existing
living
church
,
*NL*
embracing
all
the
beliefs
of
men
,
and
having
God
at
its
head
,
and
*NL*
therefore
holy
and
infallible
,
and
from
it
to
accept
the
faith
in
God
,
*NL*
in
the
creation
,
the
fall
,
the
redemption
,
than
to
begin
with
God
,
a
*NL*
mysterious
,
far-away
God
,
the
creation
,
etc.
.
But
afterwards
,
on
reading
*NL*
a
Catholic
writer
's
history
of
the
church
,
and
then
a
Greek
orthodox
*NL*
writer
's
history
of
the
church
,
and
seeing
that
the
two
churches
,
in
*NL*
their
very
conception
infallible
,
each
deny
the
authority
of
the
other
,
*NL*
Homiakov
's
doctrine
of
the
church
lost
all
its
charm
for
him
,
and
this
*NL*
edifice
crumbled
into
dust
like
the
philosophers
'
edifices
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
spring
he
was
not
himself
,
and
went
through
fearful
moments
of
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
knowing
what
I
am
and
why
I
am
here
,
life
's
impossible
;
and
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
know
,
and
so
I
ca
n't
live
,
''
Levin
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
infinite
time
,
in
infinite
matter
,
in
infinite
space
,
is
formed
a
*NL*
bubble-organism
,
and
that
bubble
lasts
a
while
and
bursts
,
and
that
*NL*
bubble
is
Me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
agonizing
error
,
but
it
was
the
sole
logical
result
of
ages
of
*NL*
human
thought
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
ultimate
belief
on
which
all
the
systems
elaborated
by
*NL*
human
thought
in
almost
all
their
ramifications
rested
.
It
was
the
*NL*
prevalent
conviction
,
and
of
all
other
explanations
Levin
had
*NL*
unconsciously
,
not
knowing
when
or
how
,
chosen
it
,
as
anyway
the
*NL*
clearest
,
and
made
it
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
merely
a
falsehood
,
it
was
the
cruel
jeer
of
some
wicked
*NL*
power
,
some
evil
,
hateful
power
,
to
whom
one
could
not
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
escape
from
this
power
.
And
the
means
of
escape
every
man
had
in
*NL*
his
own
hands
.
He
had
but
to
cut
short
this
dependence
on
evil
.
And
*NL*
there
was
one
means
--
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
,
a
happy
father
and
husband
,
in
perfect
health
,
was
several
*NL*
times
so
near
suicide
that
he
hid
the
cord
that
he
might
not
be
tempted
*NL*
to
hang
himself
,
and
was
afraid
to
go
out
with
his
gun
for
fear
of
*NL*
shooting
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Levin
did
not
shoot
himself
,
and
did
not
hang
himself
;
he
went
on
*NL*
living
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Levin
thought
what
he
was
and
what
he
was
living
for
,
he
could
find
*NL*
no
answer
to
the
questions
and
was
reduced
to
despair
,
but
he
left
off
*NL*
questioning
himself
about
it
.
It
seemed
as
though
he
knew
both
what
he
*NL*
was
and
for
what
he
was
living
,
for
he
acted
and
lived
resolutely
and
*NL*
without
hesitation
.
Indeed
,
in
these
latter
days
he
was
far
more
decided
*NL*
and
unhesitating
in
life
than
he
had
ever
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
back
to
the
country
at
the
beginning
of
June
,
he
went
back
*NL*
also
to
his
usual
pursuits
.
The
management
of
the
estate
,
his
relations
*NL*
with
the
peasants
and
the
neighbors
,
the
care
of
his
household
,
the
*NL*
management
of
his
sister
's
and
brother
's
property
,
of
which
he
had
the
*NL*
direction
,
his
relations
with
his
wife
and
kindred
,
the
care
of
his
*NL*
child
,
and
the
new
bee-keeping
hobby
he
had
taken
up
that
spring
,
filled
*NL*
all
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
occupied
him
now
,
not
because
he
justified
them
to
himself
*NL*
by
any
sort
of
general
principles
,
as
he
had
done
in
former
days
;
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
disappointed
by
the
failure
of
his
former
efforts
for
the
*NL*
general
welfare
,
and
too
much
occupied
with
his
own
thought
and
the
mass
*NL*
of
business
with
which
he
was
burdened
from
all
sides
,
he
had
completely
*NL*
given
up
thinking
of
the
general
good
,
and
he
busied
himself
with
all
*NL*
this
work
simply
because
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
do
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
--
that
he
could
not
do
otherwise
.
In
former
days
--
almost
from
*NL*
childhood
,
and
increasingly
up
to
full
manhood
--
when
he
had
tried
to
do
*NL*
anything
that
would
be
good
for
all
,
for
humanity
,
for
Russia
,
for
the
*NL*
whole
village
,
he
had
noticed
that
the
idea
of
it
had
been
pleasant
,
but
*NL*
the
work
itself
had
always
been
incoherent
,
that
then
he
had
never
had
a
*NL*
full
conviction
of
its
absolute
necessity
,
and
that
the
work
that
had
*NL*
begun
by
seeming
so
great
,
had
grown
less
and
less
,
till
it
vanished
*NL*
into
nothing
.
But
now
,
since
his
marriage
,
when
he
had
begun
to
confine
*NL*
himself
more
and
more
to
living
for
himself
,
though
he
experienced
no
*NL*
delight
at
all
at
the
thought
of
the
work
he
was
doing
,
he
felt
a
*NL*
complete
conviction
of
its
necessity
,
saw
that
it
succeeded
far
better
*NL*
than
in
old
days
,
and
that
it
kept
on
growing
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
involuntarily
it
seemed
,
he
cut
more
and
more
deeply
into
the
soil
*NL*
like
a
plough
,
so
that
he
could
not
be
drawn
out
without
turning
aside
*NL*
the
furrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
live
the
same
family
life
as
his
father
and
forefathers
--
that
is
,
in
*NL*
the
same
condition
of
culture
--
and
to
bring
up
his
children
in
the
same
,
*NL*
was
incontestably
necessary
.
It
was
as
necessary
as
dining
when
one
was
*NL*
hungry
.
And
to
do
this
,
just
as
it
was
necessary
to
cook
dinner
,
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
keep
the
mechanism
of
agriculture
at
Pokrovskoe
going
so
as
*NL*
to
yield
an
income
.
Just
as
incontestably
as
it
was
necessary
to
repay
a
*NL*
debt
was
it
necessary
to
keep
the
property
in
such
a
condition
that
his
*NL*
son
,
when
he
received
it
as
a
heritage
,
would
say
``
thank
you
''
to
his
*NL*
father
as
Levin
had
said
``
thank
you
''
to
his
grandfather
for
all
he
built
*NL*
and
planted
.
And
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
look
after
the
land
*NL*
himself
,
not
to
let
it
,
and
to
breed
cattle
,
manure
the
fields
,
and
*NL*
plant
timber
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
not
to
look
after
the
affairs
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
of
*NL*
his
sister
,
of
the
peasants
who
came
to
him
for
advice
and
were
*NL*
accustomed
to
do
so
--
as
impossible
as
to
fling
down
a
child
one
is
*NL*
carrying
in
one
's
arms
.
It
was
necessary
to
look
after
the
comfort
of
*NL*
his
sister-in-law
and
her
children
,
and
of
his
wife
and
baby
,
and
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
spend
with
them
at
least
a
short
time
each
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
this
,
together
with
shooting
and
his
new
bee-keeping
,
filled
up
*NL*
the
whole
of
Levin
's
life
,
which
had
no
meaning
at
all
for
him
,
when
he
*NL*
began
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
knowing
thoroughly
what
he
had
to
do
,
Levin
knew
in
just
the
*NL*
same
way
_
how
_
he
had
to
do
it
all
,
and
what
was
more
important
than
the
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
he
must
hire
laborers
as
cheaply
as
possible
;
but
to
hire
men
*NL*
under
bond
,
paying
them
in
advance
at
less
than
the
current
rate
of
*NL*
wages
,
was
what
he
must
not
do
,
even
though
it
was
very
profitable
.
*NL*
Selling
straw
to
the
peasants
in
times
of
scarcity
of
provender
was
what
*NL*
he
might
do
,
even
though
he
felt
sorry
for
them
;
but
the
tavern
and
the
*NL*
pothouse
must
be
put
down
,
though
they
were
a
source
of
income
.
Felling
*NL*
timber
must
be
punished
as
severely
as
possible
,
but
he
could
not
exact
*NL*
forfeits
for
cattle
being
driven
onto
his
fields
;
and
though
it
annoyed
*NL*
the
keeper
and
made
the
peasants
not
afraid
to
graze
their
cattle
on
his
*NL*
land
,
he
could
not
keep
their
cattle
as
a
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Pyotr
,
who
was
paying
a
money-lender
10
per
cent
.
a
month
,
he
must
*NL*
lend
a
sum
of
money
to
set
him
free
.
But
he
could
not
let
off
peasants
*NL*
who
did
not
pay
their
rent
,
nor
let
them
fall
into
arrears
.
It
was
*NL*
impossible
to
overlook
the
bailiff
's
not
having
mown
the
meadows
and
*NL*
letting
the
hay
spoil
;
and
it
was
equally
impossible
to
mow
those
acres
*NL*
where
a
young
copse
had
been
planted
.
It
was
impossible
to
excuse
a
*NL*
laborer
who
had
gone
home
in
the
busy
season
because
his
father
was
*NL*
dying
,
however
sorry
he
might
feel
for
him
,
and
he
must
subtract
from
*NL*
his
pay
those
costly
months
of
idleness
.
But
it
was
impossible
not
to
*NL*
allow
monthly
rations
to
the
old
servants
who
were
of
no
use
for
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
knew
that
when
he
got
home
he
must
first
of
all
go
to
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
was
unwell
,
and
that
the
peasants
who
had
been
waiting
for
three
*NL*
hours
to
see
him
could
wait
a
little
longer
.
He
knew
too
that
,
*NL*
regardless
of
all
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
taking
a
swarm
,
he
must
forego
*NL*
that
pleasure
,
and
leave
the
old
man
to
see
to
the
bees
alone
,
while
he
*NL*
talked
to
the
peasants
who
had
come
after
him
to
the
bee-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
he
were
acting
rightly
or
wrongly
he
did
not
know
,
and
far
from
*NL*
trying
to
prove
that
he
was
,
nowadays
he
avoided
all
thought
or
talk
*NL*
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reasoning
had
brought
him
to
doubt
,
and
prevented
him
from
seeing
what
*NL*
he
ought
to
do
and
what
he
ought
not
.
When
he
did
not
think
,
but
simply
*NL*
lived
,
he
was
continually
aware
of
the
presence
of
an
infallible
judge
*NL*
in
his
soul
,
determining
which
of
two
possible
courses
of
action
was
the
*NL*
better
and
which
was
the
worse
,
and
as
soon
as
he
did
not
act
rightly
,
*NL*
he
was
at
once
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
lived
,
not
knowing
and
not
seeing
any
chance
of
knowing
what
he
*NL*
was
and
what
he
was
living
for
,
and
harassed
at
this
lack
of
knowledge
*NL*
to
such
a
point
that
he
was
afraid
of
suicide
,
and
yet
firmly
laying
*NL*
down
his
own
individual
definite
path
in
life
.

Chapter
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
on
which
Sergey
Ivanovitch
came
to
Pokrovskoe
was
one
of
Levin
's
*NL*
most
painful
days
.
It
was
the
very
busiest
working
time
,
when
all
the
*NL*
peasantry
show
an
extraordinary
intensity
of
self-sacrifice
in
labor
,
*NL*
such
as
is
never
shown
in
any
other
conditions
of
life
,
and
would
be
*NL*
highly
esteemed
if
the
men
who
showed
these
qualities
themselves
thought
*NL*
highly
of
them
,
and
if
it
were
not
repeated
every
year
,
and
if
the
*NL*
results
of
this
intense
labor
were
not
so
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
reap
and
bind
the
rye
and
oats
and
to
carry
it
,
to
mow
the
meadows
,
*NL*
turn
over
the
fallows
,
thrash
the
seed
and
sow
the
winter
corn
--
all
this
*NL*
seems
so
simple
and
ordinary
;
but
to
succeed
in
getting
through
it
all
*NL*
everyone
in
the
village
,
from
the
old
man
to
the
young
child
,
must
toil
*NL*
incessantly
for
three
or
four
weeks
,
three
times
as
hard
as
usual
,
*NL*
living
on
rye-beer
,
onions
,
and
black
bread
,
thrashing
and
carrying
the
*NL*
sheaves
at
night
,
and
not
giving
more
than
two
or
three
hours
in
the
*NL*
twenty-four
to
sleep
.
And
every
year
this
is
done
all
over
Russia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
lived
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
the
country
and
in
the
*NL*
closest
relations
with
the
peasants
,
Levin
always
felt
in
this
busy
time
*NL*
that
he
was
infected
by
this
general
quickening
of
energy
in
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
morning
he
rode
over
to
the
first
sowing
of
the
rye
,
and
to
*NL*
the
oats
,
which
were
being
carried
to
the
stacks
,
and
returning
home
at
*NL*
the
time
his
wife
and
sister-in-law
were
getting
up
,
he
drank
coffee
*NL*
with
them
and
walked
to
the
farm
,
where
a
new
thrashing
machine
was
to
*NL*
be
set
working
to
get
ready
the
seed-corn
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
in
the
cool
granary
,
still
fragrant
with
the
leaves
of
*NL*
the
hazel
branches
interlaced
on
the
freshly
peeled
aspen
beams
of
the
*NL*
new
thatch
roof
.
He
gazed
through
the
open
door
in
which
the
dry
bitter
*NL*
dust
of
the
thrashing
whirled
and
played
,
at
the
grass
of
the
thrashing
*NL*
floor
in
the
sunlight
and
the
fresh
straw
that
had
been
brought
in
from
*NL*
the
barn
,
then
at
the
speckly-headed
,
white-breasted
swallows
that
flew
*NL*
chirping
in
under
the
roof
and
,
fluttering
their
wings
,
settled
in
the
*NL*
crevices
of
the
doorway
,
then
at
the
peasants
bustling
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
dusty
barn
,
and
he
thought
strange
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
all
being
done
?
''
he
thought
.
``
Why
am
I
standing
here
,
making
*NL*
them
work
?
What
are
they
all
so
busy
for
,
trying
to
show
their
zeal
*NL*
before
me
?
What
is
that
old
Matrona
,
my
old
friend
,
toiling
for
?
-LRB-
I
*NL*
doctored
her
,
when
the
beam
fell
on
her
in
the
fire
-RRB-
''
he
thought
,
*NL*
looking
at
a
thin
old
woman
who
was
raking
up
the
grain
,
moving
*NL*
painfully
with
her
bare
,
sun-blackened
feet
over
the
uneven
,
rough
*NL*
floor
.
``
Then
she
recovered
,
but
today
or
tomorrow
or
in
ten
years
she
*NL*
wo
n't
;
they
'll
bury
her
,
and
nothing
will
be
left
either
of
her
or
of
*NL*
that
smart
girl
in
the
red
jacket
,
who
with
that
skillful
,
soft
action
*NL*
shakes
the
ears
out
of
their
husks
.
They
'll
bury
her
and
this
piebald
*NL*
horse
,
and
very
soon
too
,
''
he
thought
,
gazing
at
the
heavily
moving
,
*NL*
panting
horse
that
kept
walking
up
the
wheel
that
turned
under
him
.
``
And
*NL*
they
will
bury
her
and
Fyodor
the
thrasher
with
his
curly
beard
full
of
*NL*
chaff
and
his
shirt
torn
on
his
white
shoulders
--
they
will
bury
him
.
*NL*
He
's
untying
the
sheaves
,
and
giving
orders
,
and
shouting
to
the
women
,
*NL*
and
quickly
setting
straight
the
strap
on
the
moving
wheel
.
And
what
's
*NL*
more
,
it
's
not
them
alone
--
me
they
'll
bury
too
,
and
nothing
will
be
*NL*
left
.
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
this
,
and
at
the
same
time
looked
at
his
watch
to
reckon
how
*NL*
much
they
thrashed
in
an
hour
.
He
wanted
to
know
this
so
as
to
judge
by
*NL*
it
the
task
to
set
for
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
soon
be
one
,
and
they
're
only
beginning
the
third
sheaf
,
''
thought
*NL*
Levin
.
He
went
up
to
the
man
that
was
feeding
the
machine
,
and
shouting
*NL*
over
the
roar
of
the
machine
he
told
him
to
put
it
in
more
slowly
.
``
You
*NL*
put
in
too
much
at
a
time
,
Fyodor
.
Do
you
see
--
it
gets
choked
,
that
's
*NL*
why
it
is
n't
getting
on
.
Do
it
evenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
,
black
with
the
dust
that
clung
to
his
moist
face
,
shouted
*NL*
something
in
response
,
but
still
went
on
doing
it
as
Levin
did
not
want
*NL*
him
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
,
going
up
to
the
machine
,
moved
Fyodor
aside
,
and
began
feeding
*NL*
the
corn
in
himself
.
Working
on
till
the
peasants
'
dinner
hour
,
which
*NL*
was
not
long
in
coming
,
he
went
out
of
the
barn
with
Fyodor
and
fell
*NL*
into
talk
with
him
,
stopping
beside
a
neat
yellow
sheaf
of
rye
laid
on
*NL*
the
thrashing
floor
for
seed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fyodor
came
from
a
village
at
some
distance
from
the
one
in
which
Levin
*NL*
had
once
allotted
land
to
his
cooperative
association
.
Now
it
had
been
*NL*
let
to
a
former
house
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
talked
to
Fyodor
about
this
land
and
asked
whether
Platon
,
a
*NL*
well-to-do
peasant
of
good
character
belonging
to
the
same
village
,
*NL*
would
not
take
the
land
for
the
coming
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
high
rent
;
it
would
n't
pay
Platon
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
peasant
,
picking
the
ears
off
his
sweat-drenched
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
does
Kirillov
make
it
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mituh
!
''
-LRB-
so
the
peasant
called
the
house
porter
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
contempt
-RRB-
,
``
you
may
be
sure
he
'll
make
it
pay
,
Konstantin
Dmitrievitch
!
*NL*
He
'll
get
his
share
,
however
he
has
to
squeeze
to
get
it
!
He
's
no
mercy
*NL*
on
a
Christian
.
But
Uncle
Fokanitch
''
-LRB-
so
he
called
the
old
peasant
*NL*
Platon
-RRB-
,
``
do
you
suppose
he
'd
flay
the
skin
off
a
man

Where
there
's
*NL*
debt
,
he
'll
let
anyone
off

And
he
'll
not
wring
the
last
penny
out

He
's
*NL*
a
man
too

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
will
he
let
anyone
off

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

well

folks

nothing
else

like
Mituh

he
only
thinks

Levin

breathless

turning
round
he
took
his
stick

walked
quickly
away
towards

At

the

words
that

lived
for
his

in

in

God

undefined

seemed
to
burst
out

up

they

*NL*
Levin
strode
along
the
highroad
,
absorbed
not
so
much
in
his
thoughts
*NL*
-LRB-
he
could
not
yet
disentangle
them
-RRB-
as
in
his
spiritual
condition
,
*NL*
unlike
anything
he
had
experienced
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
uttered
by
the
peasant
had
acted
on
his
soul
like
an
electric
*NL*
shock
,
suddenly
transforming
and
combining
into
a
single
whole
the
whole
*NL*
swarm
of
disjointed
,
impotent
,
separate
thoughts
that
incessantly
*NL*
occupied
his
mind
.
These
thoughts
had
unconsciously
been
in
his
mind
*NL*
even
when
he
was
talking
about
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
aware
of
something
new
in
his
soul
,
and
joyfully
tested
this
new
*NL*
thing
,
not
yet
knowing
what
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
living
for
his

for
God

For
what
God

And
could
one

anything
more
senseless
than
what
he
said

He
said
that
one
must
not
*NL*
live
for
one

own
wants

that

that
one
must
not

are
attracted
by

what

must

something
incomprehensible

for
God

whom
no
one
can
understand
nor
even
*NL*
define

What
of
it

Did
n't
I
understand
those
senseless
words
of
*NL*
Fyodor
's
?
And
understanding
them
,
did
I
doubt
of
their
truth
?
Did
I
*NL*
think
them
stupid

obscure

inexact

No

I

him

exactly
*NL*

he
understands
the
words

I
understood

more
fully

understand
anything

never

I

about
it

And

I
,

everyone

*NL*
understands
nothing
fully

this

about
this

they
have
no

are
always

*NL*
``
And
I
looked
out

Fyodor
says
that
Kirillov
lives

All

And
all

the

Fyodor
says
that
one

must

live
for
one
's
belly
,

must
live
for

who

have
thought

written
about

in

obscure
words
saying
the

we
are
all
agreed
about
this
one
thing
:
what
we
must
live
*NL*
for
and
what
is
good

I
and
all
men
have
only
one
firm
,
incontestable
,
*NL*
clear
knowledge
,
and
that
knowledge
can
not
be
explained
by
the
*NL*
reason
--
it
is
outside
it

has
no

can

*NL*
thought
Levin
,
striding
along
the
dusty
road
,
not
noticing
the
heat
nor
*NL*
his
weariness
,
and
experiencing
a
sense
of
relief
from
prolonged
*NL*
suffering
.
This
feeling
was
so
delicious
that
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
incredible
.
He
was
breathless
with
emotion
and
incapable
of
going
*NL*
farther
;
he
turned
off
the
road
into
the
forest
and
lay
down
in
the
*NL*
shade
of
an
aspen
on
the
uncut
grass
.
He
took
his
hat
off
his
hot
head
*NL*
and
lay
propped
on
his
elbow
in
the
lush
,
feathery
,
woodland
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
must
make
it
clear
to
myself

he
thought
,
*NL*
looking
intently
at
the
untrampled
grass
before
him
,
and
following
the
*NL*
movements
of
a
green
beetle
,
advancing
along
a
blade
of
couch-grass
and
*NL*
lifting
up
in
its
progress
a
leaf
of
goat-weed
.
``
What
have
I
*NL*
discovered
?
''
he
asked
himself
,
bending
aside
the
leaf
of
goat-weed
out
*NL*
of
the
beetle
's
way
and
twisting
another
blade
of
grass
above
for
the
*NL*
beetle
to
cross
over
onto
it
.
``
What
is
it
makes
me
glad
?

I
*NL*
discovered

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
discovered
nothing

have
only
found
out
what
I

I
*NL*
understand
the
force
that
in
the
past
gave
me
life
,
and
now
too
gives
me
*NL*
life
.
I
have
been
set
free
from
falsity
,
I
have
found
the
Master

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
old
I
used
to
say
that
in
my
body

that
in
the
body
of
this
grass
*NL*
and
of
this
beetle
-LRB-
there
,
she
did
n't
care
for
the
grass
,
she
's
opened
*NL*
her
wings
and
flown
away
-RRB-
,
there
was
going
on
a
transformation
of
matter
*NL*
in
accordance
with
physical
,
chemical
,
and
physiological
laws
.
And
in
*NL*
all
of
us
,
as
well
as
in
the
aspens
and
the
clouds
and
the
misty
*NL*
patches
,
there
was
a
process
of
evolution
.
Evolution
from
what
?
into
*NL*
what
?
--
Eternal
evolution
and
struggle
...
As
though
there
could
be
any
*NL*
sort
of
tendency
and
struggle
in
the
eternal
!
And
I
was
astonished
that
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
utmost
effort
of
thought
along
that
road
I
could
not
*NL*
discover
the

yearnings

*NL*
Now
I
say
that
I
know
the
meaning
of
my
life
:
`
To
live
for
God
,
for
my
*NL*
soul
.
'
And
this
meaning
,
in
spite
of
its
clearness
,
is
mysterious
and
*NL*
marvelous
.
Such
,
indeed
,
is
the
meaning
of
everything
existing
.
Yes
,
*NL*
pride
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
turning
over
on
his
stomach
and
beginning
to
*NL*
tie
a
noose
of
blades
of
grass
,
trying
not
to
break
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
merely
pride
of
intellect
,
but
dulness
of
intellect

And
most
*NL*
of
all
,
the
deceitfulness
;
yes
,
the
deceitfulness
of
intellect

The
*NL*
cheating
knavishness
of
intellect

that
's
it

he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
briefly
went
through
,
mentally
,
the
whole
course
of
his
ideas
*NL*
during
the
last
two
years
,
the
beginning
of
which
was
the
clear
*NL*
confronting
of
death
at
the
sight
of
his
dear
brother
hopelessly
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
the
first
time
,
grasping
that
for
every
man
,
and
himself
too
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
store
but
suffering
,
death
,
and
forgetfulness
,
he
*NL*
had
made
up
his
mind
that
life
was
impossible
like
that
,
and
that
he
*NL*
must
either
interpret
life
so
that
it
would
not
present
itself
to
him
as
*NL*
the
evil
jest
of
some
devil
,
or
shoot
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
not
done
either
,
but
had
gone
on
living
,
thinking
,
and
*NL*
feeling
,
and
had
even
at
that
very
time
married
,
and
had
had
many
joys
*NL*
and
had
been
happy
,
when
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
meaning
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
this
mean
?
It
meant
that
he
had
been
living
rightly
,
but
*NL*
thinking
wrongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
lived
-LRB-
without
being
aware
of
it
-RRB-
on
those
spiritual
truths
that
*NL*
he
had
sucked
in
with
his
mother
's
milk
,
but
he
had
thought
,
not
merely
*NL*
without
recognition
of
these
truths
,
but
studiously
ignoring
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
was
clear
to
him
that
he
could
only
live
by
virtue
of
the
beliefs
*NL*
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
have
been

these
beliefs

if
I
had
not
known
that
I
must
live

*NL*
not

I
should
have
robbed

*NL*
Nothing

have
existed

And
with
the
utmost
stretch

imagination
he
could
not

conceive
the
brutal
creature

would
have

The

itself

in
my
knowledge

right

I

I
was
told

I
believed

they
told

But
who
discovered

Not

Reason
discovered
the

struggle
for
existence

and
the
law
that
requires
us
to
oppress
all
who
*NL*
hinder
the
satisfaction

That

the
deduction

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
remembered
a
scene
he
had
lately
witnessed
between
Dolly
and
*NL*
her
children
.
The
children
,
left
to
themselves
,
had
begun
cooking
*NL*
raspberries
over
the
candles
and
squirting
milk
into
each
other
's
mouths
*NL*
with
a
syringe
.
Their
mother
,
catching
them
at
these
pranks
,
began
*NL*
reminding
them
in
Levin
's
presence
of
the
trouble
their
mischief
gave
to
*NL*
the
grown-up
people
,
and
that
this
trouble
was
all
for
their
sake
,
and
*NL*
that
if
they
smashed
the
cups
they
would
have
nothing
to
drink
their
tea
*NL*
out
of
,
and
that
if
they
wasted
the
milk
,
they
would
have
nothing
to
*NL*
eat
,
and
die
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Levin
had
been
struck
by
the
passive
,
weary
incredulity
with
which
*NL*
the
children
heard
what
their
mother
said
to
them
.
They
were
simply
*NL*
annoyed
that
their
amusing
play
had
been
interrupted
,
and
did
not
*NL*
believe
a
word
of
what
their
mother
was
saying
.
They
could
not
believe
*NL*
it
indeed
,
for
they
could
not
take
in
the
immensity
of
all
they
*NL*
habitually
enjoyed
,
and
so
could
not
conceive
that
what
they
were
*NL*
destroying
was
the
very
thing
they
lived
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
all
comes
of
itself
,
''
they
thought
,
``
and
there
's
nothing
*NL*
interesting
or
important
about
it

it
has
always
been
so

always
will
be
so

And
it
's
all
always
the
same

We
've
no
need
to
think
*NL*
about
that
,
it
's
all
ready
.
But
we
want
to
invent
something
of
our
own
,
*NL*
and
new
.
So
we
thought
of
putting
raspberries
in
a
cup
,
and
cooking
them
*NL*
over
a
candle
,
and
squirting
milk
straight
into
each
other
's
mouths
.
*NL*
That
's
fun
,
and
something
new

and
not
a

worse
than
drinking
out
of
*NL*
cups
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
just

he
thought

``
And
do
n't
all
the
theories

the

trying
by

*NL*
path

which
is
strange
and
not
natural
to
man

to
bring
him
*NL*
to
a
knowledge
of
what
he
has
known
long
ago

and
knows
so
certainly
*NL*
that
he
could
not
live
at
all
without
it

Is
n't
it
distinctly
to
be
seen
*NL*
in
the
development

what

just
as
positively
as
the
*NL*
peasant
Fyodor

not
a

more
clearly
than
he

is
simply
trying

by
a
dubious
intellectual
path

come
back
to
what
everyone
knows

Now

naughty
then

without

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whence
have
I
that
joyful
knowledge

shared
with
the
peasant
,
that
*NL*
alone
gives
peace

Whence
did
I
get
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brought
up
with

Christian

my
whole

filled
with

the

Christianity
has
given
me

full
of

living

I
did
not
understand
them
,
*NL*
and
destroy

that
is
try

what
I
live
by

And
as
soon
as
an
*NL*
important
moment
of
life
comes
,
like
the
children
when
they
are
cold
and
*NL*
hungry

I
turn
to
Him

and
even
less
than
the
children

their
mother
*NL*
scolds
them
for
their
childish
mischief

I
feel

*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
I
know

I
know
not
by
reason

but
it
has
been
given
to
me

*NL*
revealed
to
me
,
and
I
know
it
with
my
heart
,
by
faith
in
the
chief
thing
*NL*
taught
by
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
church
!
the
church
!
''
Levin
repeated
to
himself
.
He
turned
over
on
*NL*
the
other
side
,
and
leaning
on
his
elbow
,
fell
to
gazing
into
the
*NL*
distance
at
a
herd
of
cattle
crossing
over
to
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
I
believe
in
all
the
church
teaches
?
''
he
thought
,
trying
*NL*
himself
,
and
thinking
of
everything
that
could
destroy
his
present
peace
*NL*
of
mind
.
Intentionally
he
recalled
all
those
doctrines
of
the
church
*NL*
which
had
always
seemed
most
strange
and
had
always
been
a
stumbling
*NL*
block
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Creation
?
But
how
did
I
explain
existence
?
By
existence
?
By
*NL*
nothing
?
The
devil
and
sin
.
But
how
do
I
explain
evil
?
...
The
*NL*
atonement
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
nothing
,
nothing
,
and
I
can
know
nothing
but
what
has
been
*NL*
told
to
me
and
all
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
not
a
single
article
of
faith
of
the
*NL*
church
which
could
destroy
the
chief
thing
--
faith
in
God
,
in
goodness
,
*NL*
as
the
one
goal
of
man
's
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
every
article
of
faith
of
the
church
could
be
put
the
faith
in
the
*NL*
service
of
truth
instead
of
one
's
desires
.
And
each
doctrine
did
not
*NL*
simply
leave
that
faith
unshaken
,
each
doctrine
seemed
essential
to
*NL*
complete
that
great
miracle
,
continually
manifest
upon
earth
,
that
made
*NL*
it
possible
for
each
man
and
millions
of
different
sorts
of
men
,
wise
*NL*
men
and
imbeciles
,
old
men
and
children
--
all
men
,
peasants
,
Lvov
,
Kitty
,
*NL*
beggars
and
kings
to
understand
perfectly
the
same
one
thing
,
and
to
*NL*
build
up
thereby
that
life
of
the
soul
which
alone
is
worth
living
,
and
*NL*
which
alone
is
precious
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lying
on
his
back
,
he
gazed
up
now
into
the
high
,
cloudless
sky
.
``
Do
I
*NL*
not
know
that
that
is
infinite
space
,
and
that
it
is
not
a
round
arch
?
*NL*
But
,
however
I
screw
up
my
eyes
and
strain
my
sight
,
I
can
not
see
it
not
*NL*
round
and
not
bounded
,
and
in
spite
of
my
knowing
about
infinite
space
,
*NL*
I
am
incontestably
right
when
I
see
a
solid
blue
dome
,
and
more
right
*NL*
than
when
I
strain
my
eyes
to
see
beyond
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
ceased
thinking
,
and
only
,
as
it
were
,
listened
to
mysterious
*NL*
voices
that
seemed
talking
joyfully
and
earnestly
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
this
be
faith
?
''
he
thought
,
afraid
to
believe
in
his
happiness
.
``
My
*NL*
God
,
I
thank
Thee
!
''
he
said
,
gulping
down
his
sobs
,
and
with
both
hands
*NL*
brushing
away
the
tears
that
filled
his
eyes
.

Chapter
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
looked
before
him
and
saw
a
herd
of
cattle
,
then
he
caught
sight
*NL*
of
his
trap
with
Raven
in
the
shafts
,
and
the
coachman
,
who
,
driving
up
*NL*
to
the
herd
,
said
something
to
the
herdsman
.
Then
he
heard
the
rattle
of
*NL*
the
wheels
and
the
snort
of
the
sleek
horse
close
by
him
.
But
he
was
so
*NL*
buried
in
his
thoughts
that
he
did
not
even
wonder
why
the
coachman
had
*NL*
come
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
thought
of
that
when
the
coachman
had
driven
quite
up
to
him
and
*NL*
shouted
to
him
.
``
The
mistress
sent
me
.
Your
brother
has
come
,
and
some
*NL*
gentleman
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
got
into
the
trap
and
took
the
reins
.
As
though
just
roused
out
of
*NL*
sleep
,
for
a
long
while
Levin
could
not
collect
his
faculties
.
He
stared
*NL*
at
the
sleek
horse
flecked
with
lather
between
his
haunches
and
on
his
*NL*
neck
,
where
the
harness
rubbed
,
stared
at
Ivan
the
coachman
sitting
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
remembered
that
he
was
expecting
his
brother
,
thought
*NL*
that
his
wife
was
most
likely
uneasy
at
his
long
absence
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
guess
who
was
the
visitor
who
had
come
with
his
brother
.
And
his
brother
*NL*
and
his
wife
and
the
unknown
guest
seemed
to
him
now
quite
different
*NL*
from
before
.
He
fancied
that
now
his
relations
with
all
men
would
be
*NL*
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
my
brother
there
will
be
none
of
that
aloofness
there
always
used
*NL*
to
be
between
us
,
there
will
be
no
disputes
;
with
Kitty
there
shall
*NL*
never
be
quarrels
;
with
the
visitor
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
I
will
be
*NL*
friendly
and
nice
;
with
the
servants
,
with
Ivan
,
it
will
all
be
*NL*
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pulling
the
stiff
rein
and
holding
in
the
good
horse
that
snorted
with
*NL*
impatience
and
seemed
begging
to
be
let
go
,
Levin
looked
round
at
Ivan
*NL*
sitting
beside
him
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
unoccupied
hand
,
*NL*
continually
pressing
down
his
shirt
as
it
puffed
out
,
and
he
tried
to
*NL*
find
something
to
start
a
conversation
about
with
him
.
He
would
have
*NL*
said
that
Ivan
had
pulled
the
saddle-girth
up
too
high
,
but
that
was
*NL*
like
blame
,
and
he
longed
for
friendly
,
warm
talk
.
Nothing
else
occurred
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
must
keep
to
the
right
and
mind
that
stump
,
''
said
the
*NL*
coachman
,
pulling
the
rein
Levin
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
touch
and
do
n't
teach
me
!
''
said
Levin
,
angered
by
this
*NL*
interference
.
Now
,
as
always
,
interference
made
him
angry
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
sorrowfully
at
once
how
mistaken
had
been
his
supposition
that
his
*NL*
spiritual
condition
could
immediately
change
him
in
contact
with
*NL*
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
home
when
he
saw
Grisha
and
Tanya
*NL*
running
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uncle
Kostya
!
mamma
's
coming
,
and
grandfather
,
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
*NL*
and
someone
else
,
''
they
said
,
clambering
up
into
the
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
awfully
terrible
person
!
And
he
does
like
this
with
his
arms
,
''
said
*NL*
Tanya
,
getting
up
in
the
trap
and
mimicking
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
or
young
?
''
asked
Levin
,
laughing
,
reminded
of
someone
,
he
did
not
*NL*
know
whom
,
by
Tanya
's
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
hope
it
's
not
a
tiresome
person
!
''
thought
Levin
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
turned
,
at
a
bend
in
the
road
,
and
saw
the
party
coming
,
*NL*
Levin
recognized
Katavasov
in
a
straw
hat
,
walking
along
swinging
his
*NL*
arms
just
as
Tanya
had
shown
him
.
Katavasov
was
very
fond
of
discussing
*NL*
metaphysics
,
having
derived
his
notions
from
natural
science
writers
who
*NL*
had
never
studied
metaphysics
,
and
in
Moscow
Levin
had
had
many
*NL*
arguments
with
him
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
one
of
these
arguments
,
in
which
Katavasov
had
obviously
considered
*NL*
that
he
came
off
victorious
,
was
the
first
thing
Levin
thought
of
as
he
*NL*
recognized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
whatever
I
do
,
I
wo
n't
argue
and
give
utterance
to
my
ideas
*NL*
lightly
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Getting
out
of
the
trap
and
greeting
his
brother
and
Katavasov
,
Levin
*NL*
asked
about
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
taken
Mitya
to
Kolok
''
-LRB-
a
copse
near
the
house
-RRB-
.
``
She
meant
to
*NL*
have
him
out
there
because
it
's
so
hot
indoors
,
''
said
Dolly
.
Levin
had
*NL*
always
advised
his
wife
not
to
take
the
baby
to
the
wood
,
thinking
it
*NL*
unsafe
,
and
he
was
not
pleased
to
hear
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
rushes
about
from
place
to
place
with
him
,
''
said
the
prince
,
*NL*
smiling
.
``
I
advised
her
to
try
putting
him
in
the
ice
cellar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
meant
to
come
to
the
bee
house
.
She
thought
you
would
be
there
.
We
*NL*
are
going
there
,
''
said
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
are
you
doing
?
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
falling
back
*NL*
from
the
rest
and
walking
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
special
.
Busy
as
usual
with
the
land
,
''
answered
Levin
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
about
you
?
Come
for
long
?
We
have
been
expecting
you
for
*NL*
such
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
for
a
fortnight
.
I
've
a
great
deal
to
do
in
Moscow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
the
brothers
'
eyes
met
,
and
Levin
,
in
spite
of
the
desire
*NL*
he
always
had
,
stronger
than
ever
just
now
,
to
be
on
affectionate
and
*NL*
still
more
open
terms
with
his
brother
,
felt
an
awkwardness
in
looking
*NL*
at
him
.
He
dropped
his
eyes
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Casting
over
the
subjects
of
conversation
that
would
be
pleasant
to
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
and
would
keep
him
off
the
subject
of
the
Servian
war
*NL*
and
the
Slavonic
question
,
at
which
he
had
hinted
by
the
allusion
to
*NL*
what
he
had
to
do
in
Moscow
,
Levin
began
to
talk
of
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
*NL*
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
have
there
been
reviews
of
your
book
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
smiled
at
the
intentional
character
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
is
interested
in
that
now
,
and
I
less
than
anyone
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Just
look
,
Darya
Alexandrovna
,
we
shall
have
a
shower
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
pointing
with
a
sunshade
at
the
white
rain
clouds
that
showed
above
the
*NL*
aspen
tree-tops
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
these
words
were
enough
to
re-establish
again
between
the
brothers
*NL*
that
tone
--
hardly
hostile
,
but
chilly
--
which
Levin
had
been
so
longing
*NL*
to
avoid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
went
up
to
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
jolly
of
you
to
make
up
your
mind
to
come
,
''
he
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
meaning
to
a
long
while
.
Now
we
shall
have
some
discussion
,
*NL*
we
'll
see
to
that
.
Have
you
been
reading
Spencer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
finished
reading
him
,
''
said
Levin
.
``
But
I
do
n't
need
him
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
that
's
interesting
.
Why
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
I
'm
fully
convinced
that
the
solution
of
the
problems
that
*NL*
interest
me
I
shall
never
find
in
him
and
his
like
.
Now
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Katavasov
's
serene
and
good-humored
expression
suddenly
struck
him
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
such
tenderness
for
his
own
happy
mood
,
which
he
was
*NL*
unmistakably
disturbing
by
this
conversation
,
that
he
remembered
his
*NL*
resolution
and
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
'll
talk
later
on
,
''
he
added
.
``
If
we
're
going
to
the
bee
house
,
*NL*
it
's
this
way
,
along
this
little
path
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
along
the
narrow
path
to
a
little
uncut
meadow
covered
on
one
side
*NL*
with
thick
clumps
of
brilliant
heart
's
-
ease
among
which
stood
up
here
*NL*
and
there
tall
,
dark
green
tufts
of
hellebore
,
Levin
settled
his
guests
*NL*
in
the
dense
,
cool
shade
of
the
young
aspens
on
a
bench
and
some
stumps
*NL*
purposely
put
there
for
visitors
to
the
bee
house
who
might
be
afraid
of
*NL*
the
bees
,
and
he
went
off
himself
to
the
hut
to
get
bread
,
cucumbers
,
*NL*
and
fresh
honey
,
to
regale
them
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trying
to
make
his
movements
as
deliberate
as
possible
,
and
listening
to
*NL*
the
bees
that
buzzed
more
and
more
frequently
past
him
,
he
walked
along
*NL*
the
little
path
to
the
hut
.
In
the
very
entry
one
bee
hummed
angrily
,
*NL*
caught
in
his
beard
,
but
he
carefully
extricated
it
.
Going
into
the
*NL*
shady
outer
room
,
he
took
down
from
the
wall
his
veil
,
that
hung
on
a
*NL*
peg
,
and
putting
it
on
,
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
he
*NL*
went
into
the
fenced-in
bee-garden
,
where
there
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
*NL*
closely
mown
space
in
regular
rows
,
fastened
with
bast
on
posts
,
all
the
*NL*
hives
he
knew
so
well
,
the
old
stocks
,
each
with
its
own
history
,
and
*NL*
along
the
fences
the
younger
swarms
hived
that
year
.
In
front
of
the
*NL*
openings
of
the
hives
,
it
made
his
eyes
giddy
to
watch
the
bees
and
*NL*
drones
whirling
round
and
round
about
the
same
spot
,
while
among
them
*NL*
the
working
bees
flew
in
and
out
with
spoils
or
in
search
of
them
,
*NL*
always
in
the
same
direction
into
the
wood
to
the
flowering
lime
trees
*NL*
and
back
to
the
hives
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
ears
were
filled
with
the
incessant
hum
in
various
notes
,
now
the
*NL*
busy
hum
of
the
working
bee
flying
quickly
off
,
then
the
blaring
of
the
*NL*
lazy
drone
,
and
the
excited
buzz
of
the
bees
on
guard
protecting
their
*NL*
property
from
the
enemy
and
preparing
to
sting
.
On
the
farther
side
of
*NL*
the
fence
the
old
bee-keeper
was
shaving
a
hoop
for
a
tub
,
and
he
did
*NL*
not
see
Levin
.
Levin
stood
still
in
the
midst
of
the
beehives
and
did
*NL*
not
call
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
glad
of
a
chance
to
be
alone
to
recover
from
the
influence
of
*NL*
ordinary
actual
life
,
which
had
already
depressed
his
happy
mood
.
He
*NL*
thought
that
he
had
already
had
time
to
lose
his
temper
with
Ivan
,
to
*NL*
show
coolness
to
his
brother
,
and
to
talk
flippantly
with
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
it
have
been
only
a
momentary
mood
,
and
will
it
pass
and
leave
no
*NL*
trace
?
''
he
thought
.
But
the
same
instant
,
going
back
to
his
mood
,
he
*NL*
felt
with
delight
that
something
new
and
important
had
happened
to
him
.
*NL*
Real
life
had
only
for
a
time
overcast
the
spiritual
peace
he
had
found
,
*NL*
but
it
was
still
untouched
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
the
bees
,
whirling
round
him
,
now
menacing
him
and
distracting
*NL*
his
attention
,
prevented
him
from
enjoying
complete
physical
peace
,
*NL*
forced
him
to
restrain
his
movements
to
avoid
them
,
so
had
the
petty
*NL*
cares
that
had
swarmed
about
him
from
the
moment
he
got
into
the
trap
*NL*
restricted
his
spiritual
freedom
;
but
that
lasted
only
so
long
as
he
was
*NL*
among
them
.
Just
as
his
bodily
strength
was
still
unaffected
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
bees
,
so
too
was
the
spiritual
strength
that
he
had
just
become
*NL*
aware
of
.

did

He
was
carefully
with

getting

covered
with
sticky

out
of

full
of

asked
the

,
unmistakably
taking
up
a

conversation
that
had
sprung
up
in
Levin
's
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With

Sergey
Ivanovitch
answered
,
smiling
serenely
,
as
he
*NL*
extricated
the
bee
,
dark
with
honey
and
helplessly
kicking
,
and
put
it
*NL*
with
the
knife
on

stout
aspen

said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

is
not
speaking

said
Levin
,
coming
to
the
*NL*
assistance
of
his
father-in-law
,
``

of

*NL*
``
Well

Katavasov
said
to
Levin
with
a
*NL*
smile

distinctly
challenging
him
to
a
discussion

``
Why
have
not
private
*NL*
persons
the
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
theory
's
this
:
war
is
on
one
side
such
a
beastly
,
cruel
,

*NL*
awful
thing
,
that
no
one
man

not
to
speak
of

Christian
,
can
*NL*
individually
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
beginning

that
can
only
be
done
by
a
government

is
called
upon
to
do
this
,
*NL*
and
is
driven
inevitably
into
war

On
the
other
hand
,
both
political
*NL*
science
and
common
sense
teach
us
that
in
matters
of
state
,
and
*NL*
especially
in
the
matter
of
war
,
private
citizens
must
forego
their
*NL*
personal
individual
will

*NL*
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
and
Katavasov
had
their
replies
ready
,
and
both
began
*NL*
speaking
at
the

time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
point
is
,
my
dear

that
there
may
be

not
carry
out
the
will
of

then
the
*NL*
public
asserts
its
will
,
''
said
Katavasov
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
evidently
Sergey
Ivanovitch
did
not
approve
of
this
answer
.
His
*NL*
brows
contracted
at
Katavasov
's
words
and
he
said
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
put
the
matter
in
its
true
light
.
There
is
no
question
here
*NL*
of
a
declaration
of
war
,
but
simply
the
expression
of
a
human
Christian
*NL*
feeling
.
Our
brothers
,
one
with
us
in
religion
and
in
race
,
are
being
*NL*
massacred
.
Even
supposing
they
were
not
our
brothers
nor
*NL*
fellow-Christians
,
but
simply
children
,
women
,
old
people
,
feeling
is
*NL*
aroused
and
Russians
go
eagerly
to
help
in
stopping
these
atrocities
.
*NL*
Fancy
,
if
you
were
going
along
the
street
and
saw
drunken
men
beating
a
*NL*
woman
or
a
child
--
I
imagine
you
would
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
war
*NL*
had
been
declared
on
the
men
,
but
would
throw
yourself
on
them
,
and
*NL*
protect
the
victim

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
should
not

them

Levin

*NL*
``
Yes

you
would
kill
them

*NL*
``
I

saw
that

I
might
give
way
to
my
impulse
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
but
I
ca
n't
say
beforehand
.
And
such
a
momentary
impulse
there
*NL*
is
not
,

there
can
not
be
,
in
the
case
of
the
oppression
of
the

Slavonic
peoples

*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
for
you
there
is
not

for

there
is
,

said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
frowning
with
displeasure
.
``
There
are
traditions
still
*NL*
extant

Slavs
of
the
true
faith
suffering
under
the

yoke
of
the
`
unclean
sons
of
Hagar

The
people
have
heard
of
the
*NL*
sufferings
of
their
brethren
and
have
spoken
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
so
,
''
said
Levin
evasively
;
``
but
I
do
n't
see
it

I

one
of
the

people
myself

I
do
n't
feel
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
am
I
too

said
the
old
prince
.
``
I
've
been
staying
abroad

*NL*
reading
the
papers

and
I
must
own

up
to
the
time
of
the
Bulgarian

atrocities

I
could
n't
make
out
why
it

Russians

all

sudden
so
fond
of
their
Slavonic

while
I
did
n't
feel
the

slightest
affection

them

I
was
very
much
upset

thought
I
was
a

monster

that
it
was
the

But
since
I

have
been

my
mind
's
been
set
at

see

interested

to
learn
the
spirit
of
the
people
by
arithmetical
*NL*
computation
,
of
course
it
's
very
difficult
to
arrive
at
it
.
And
voting
*NL*
has
not
been
introduced
among
us
and
can
not
be
introduced
,
for
it
does
*NL*
not
express
the
will
of
the
people
;
but
there
are
other
ways
of
reaching
*NL*
that
.
It
is
felt
in
the
air
,
it
is
felt
by
the
heart
.
I
wo
n't
speak
of
*NL*
those
deep
currents
which
are
astir
in
the
still
ocean
of
the
people
,
*NL*
and
which
are
evident
to
every
unprejudiced
man
;
let
us
look
at
society
*NL*
in
the
narrow
sense
.
All
the
most
diverse
sections
of
the
educated
*NL*
public
,
hostile
before
,
are
merged
in
one
.
Every
division
is
at
an
end
,
*NL*
all
the
public
organs
say
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
,
all
feel
*NL*
the
mighty
torrent
that
has
overtaken
them
and
is
carrying
them
in
one
*NL*
direction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
all
the
newspapers
do
say
the
same
thing
,
''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
``
That
's
true
.
But
so
it
is
the
same
thing
that
all
the
frogs
croak
*NL*
before
a
storm
.
One
can
hear
nothing
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frogs
or
no
frogs
,
I
'm
not
the
editor
of
a
paper
and
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
defend
them
;
but
I
am
speaking
of
the
unanimity
in
the
intellectual
*NL*
world
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
addressing
his
brother
.
Levin
would
have
*NL*
answered
,
but
the
old
prince
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
about
that
unanimity
,
that
's
another
thing
,
one
may
say
,
''
said
*NL*
the
prince
.
``
There
's
my
son-in-law
,
Stepan
Arkadyevitch
,
you
know
him
.
*NL*
He
's
got
a
place
now
on
the
committee
of
a
commission
and
something
or
*NL*
other
,
I
do
n't
remember
.
Only
there
's
nothing
to
do
in
it
--
why
,
Dolly
,
*NL*
it
's
no
secret
!
--
and
a
salary
of
eight
thousand
.
You
try
asking
him
*NL*
whether
his
post
is
of
use
,
he
'll
prove
to
you
that
it
's
most
necessary
.
*NL*
And
he
's
a
truthful
man
too
,
but
there
's
no
refusing
to
believe
in
the
*NL*
utility
of
eight
thousand
roubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
asked
me
to
give
a
message
to
Darya
Alexandrovna
about
the
*NL*
post
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
reluctantly
,
feeling
the
prince
's
remark
*NL*
to
be
ill-timed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
with
the
unanimity
of
the
press
.
That
's
been
explained
to
me
:
*NL*
as
soon
as
there
's
war
their
incomes
are
doubled
.
How
can
they
help
*NL*
believing
in
the
destinies
of
the
people
and
the
Slavonic
races
...
and
*NL*
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
many
of
the
papers
,
but
that
's
unjust
,

said
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
only
make
one
condition
,
''
pursued
the
old
prince
.
``
Alphonse
*NL*
Karr
said
a
capital
thing
before
the
war
with
Prussia
:
`
You
consider
war
*NL*
to
be
inevitable

Very
good

Let
everyone

advocates
war
be
enrolled

in
a
special
regiment
of
advance-guards

for
the
front
of
every
storm

to
lead
them
all
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
lot
the
editors
would
make
!
''
said
Katavasov
,
with
a
loud
roar
,
*NL*
as
he
pictured
the
editors
he
knew
in
this
picked
legion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they

run

said
Dolly
,
``
they
'd
only
be
in
the
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
they
ran
away

then
we
'd
have
grape-shot
or
Cossacks
with
whips
*NL*
behind
them

''
said
the
prince
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
's
a
joke
,
and
a
poor
one
too
,
if
you
'll
excuse
my
saying
so

*NL*
prince
,
''
said
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
it
was
a
joke
,
that
...
''
Levin
was
beginning
,
but
*NL*
Sergey
Ivanovitch
interrupted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
member
of
society
is
called
upon
to
do
his
own
special
work
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
And
men
of
thought
are
doing
their
work
when
they
express
*NL*
public
opinion
.
And
the
single-hearted
and
full
expression
of
public
*NL*
opinion
is
the
service
of
the
press
and
a
phenomenon
to
rejoice
us
at
*NL*
the
same
time
.
Twenty
years
ago
we
should
have
been
silent
,
but
now
we
*NL*
have
heard
the
voice
of
the
Russian
people
,
which
is
ready
to
rise
as
*NL*
one
man
and
ready
to
sacrifice
itself
for
its
oppressed
brethren
;
that
*NL*
is
a
great
step
and
a
proof
of
strength
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
not
only
making
a
sacrifice
,
but
killing
Turks
,
''
said
Levin
*NL*
timidly
.
``
The
people
make
sacrifices
and
are
ready
to
make
sacrifices
*NL*
for
their
soul
,
but
not
for
murder

''
he
added
,
instinctively
connecting
*NL*
the
conversation
with
the
ideas
that
had
been
absorbing
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
their
soul
?
That
's
a
most
puzzling
expression
for
a
natural
science
*NL*
man
,
do
you
understand
?
What
sort
of
thing
is
the
soul
?

said
Katavasov
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
God
,
I
have
n't
the
faintest
idea

said
Katavasov
with
a
loud
*NL*
roar
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
bring
not
peace
,
but
a
sword
,
'
says
Christ
,
''
Sergey
Ivanovitch
*NL*
rejoined
for
his
part
,
quoting
as
simply
as
though
it
were
the
easiest
*NL*
thing
to
understand
the
very
passage
that
had
always
puzzled
Levin
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
no
doubt
,
''
the
old
man
repeated
again
.
He
was
standing
near
*NL*
them
and
responded
to
a
chance
glance
turned
in
his
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
fellow
,
you
're
defeated
,
utterly
defeated
!
''
cried
Katavasov
*NL*
good-humoredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
reddened
with
vexation
,
not
at
being
defeated
,
but
at
having
*NL*
failed
to
control
himself
and
being
drawn
into
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
argue
with
them
,
''
he
thought
;
``
they
wear
impenetrable
*NL*
armor
,
while
I
'm
naked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
that
it
was
impossible
to
convince
his
brother
and
Katavasov
,
and
*NL*
he
saw
even
less
possibility
of
himself
agreeing
with
them
.
What
they
*NL*
advocated
was
the
very
pride
of
intellect
that
had
almost
been
his
ruin
.
*NL*
He
could
not
admit
that
some
dozens
of
men
,
among
them
his
brother
,
had
*NL*
the
right
,
on
the
ground
of
what
they
were
told
by
some
hundreds
of
glib
*NL*
volunteers
swarming
to
the
capital
,
to
say
that
they
and
the
newspapers
*NL*
were
expressing
the
will
and
feeling
of
the
people
,
and
a
feeling
which
*NL*
was
expressed
in
vengeance
and
murder
.
He
could
not
admit
this
,
because
*NL*
he
neither
saw
the
expression
of
such
feelings
in
the
people
among
whom
*NL*
he
was
living
,
nor
found
them
in
himself
-LRB-
and
he
could
not
but
consider
*NL*
himself
one
of
the
persons
making
up
the
Russian
people
-RRB-
,
and
most
of
*NL*
all
because
he
,
like
the
people
,
did
not
know
and
could
not
know
what
is
*NL*
for
the
general
good
,
though
he
knew
beyond
a
doubt
that
this
general
*NL*
good
could
be
attained
only
by
the
strict
observance
of
that
law
of
*NL*
right
and
wrong
which
has
been
revealed
to
every
man
,
and
therefore
he
*NL*
could
not
wish
for
war
or
advocate
war
for
any
general
objects
whatever
.
*NL*
He
said
as
Mihalitch
did
and
the
people
,
who
had
expressed
their
feeling
*NL*
in
the
traditional
invitations
of
the
Varyagi
:
``
Be
princes
and
rule
over
*NL*
us
.
Gladly
we
promise
complete
submission
.
All
the
labor
,
all
*NL*
humiliations
,
all
sacrifices
we
take
upon
ourselves
;
but
we
will
not
*NL*
judge
and
decide
.
''
And
now
,
according
to
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
account
,
*NL*
the
people
had
foregone
this
privilege
they
had
bought
at
such
a
costly
*NL*
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
say
too
that
if
public
opinion
were
an
infallible
guide
,
*NL*
then
why
were
not
revolutions
and
the
commune
as
lawful
as
the
movement
*NL*
in
favor
of
the
Slavonic
peoples
?
But
these
were
merely
thoughts
that
*NL*
could
settle
nothing
.
One
thing
could
be
seen
beyond
doubt
--
that
was
*NL*
that
at
the
actual
moment
the
discussion
was
irritating
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
,
and
so
it
was
wrong
to
continue
it
.
And
Levin
ceased
*NL*
speaking
and
then
called
the
attention
of
his
guests
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
storm
clouds
were
gathering
,
and
that
they
had
better
be
going
home
*NL*
before
it
rained
.

*NL*
Chapter
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
prince
and
Sergey
Ivanovitch
got
into
the
trap
and
drove
off
;
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
party
hastened
homewards
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
storm-clouds
,
turning
white
and
then
black
,
moved
down
so
*NL*
quickly
that
they
had
to
quicken
their
pace
to
get
home
before
the
rain
.
*NL*
The
foremost
clouds
,
lowering
and
black
as
soot-laden
smoke
,
rushed
with
*NL*
extraordinary
swiftness
over
the
sky
.
They
were
still
two
hundred
paces
*NL*
from
home
and
a
gust
of
wind
had
already
blown
up
,
and
every
second
the
*NL*
downpour
might
be
looked
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
ran
ahead
with
frightened
and
gleeful
shrieks
.
Darya
*NL*
Alexandrovna
,
struggling
painfully
with
her
skirts
that
clung
round
her
*NL*
legs
,
was
not
walking
,
but
running
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
children
.
The
*NL*
men
of
the
party
,
holding
their
hats
on
,
strode
with
long
steps
beside
*NL*
her
.
They
were
just
at
the
steps
when
a
big
drop
fell
splashing
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
iron
guttering
.
The
children
and
their
elders
after
them
ran
*NL*
into
the
shelter
of
the
house
,
talking
merrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Katerina
Alexandrovna
?
''
Levin
asked
of
Agafea
Mihalovna
,
who
met
them
*NL*
with
kerchiefs
and
rugs
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
she
was
with
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mitya
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
copse
,
he
must
be
,
and
the
nurse
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Levin
snatched
up
the
rugs
and
ran
towards
the
copse
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
brief
interval
of
time
the
storm
clouds
had
moved
on
,
covering
*NL*
the
sun
so
completely
that
it
was
dark
as
an
eclipse
.
Stubbornly
,
as
*NL*
though
insisting
on
its
rights
,
the
wind
stopped
Levin
,
and
tearing
the
*NL*
leaves
and
flowers
off
the
lime
trees
and
stripping
the
white
birch
*NL*
branches
into
strange
unseemly
nakedness
,
it
twisted
everything
on
one
*NL*
side
--
acacias
,
flowers
,
burdocks
,
long
grass
,
and
tall
tree-tops
.
The
*NL*
peasant
girls
working
in
the
garden
ran
shrieking
into
shelter
in
the
*NL*
servants
'
quarters
.
The
streaming
rain
had
already
flung
its
white
veil
*NL*
over
all
the
distant
forest
and
half
the
fields
close
by
,
and
was
*NL*
rapidly
swooping
down
upon
the
copse
.
The
wet
of
the
rain
spurting
up
in
*NL*
tiny
drops
could
be
smelt
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Holding
his
head
bent
down
before
him
,
and
struggling
with
the
wind
that
*NL*
strove
to
tear
the
wraps
away
from
him
,
Levin
was
moving
up
to
the
copse
*NL*
and
had
just
caught
sight
of
something
white
behind
the
oak
tree
,
when
*NL*
there
was
a
sudden
flash
,
the
whole
earth
seemed
on
fire
,
and
the
vault
*NL*
of
heaven
seemed
crashing
overhead
.
Opening
his
blinded
eyes
,
Levin
*NL*
gazed
through
the
thick
veil
of
rain
that
separated
him
now
from
the
*NL*
copse
,
and
to
his
horror
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
green
crest
of
*NL*
the
familiar
oak-tree
in
the
middle
of
the
copse
uncannily
changing
its
*NL*
position
.
``
Can
it
have
been
struck
?
''
Levin
hardly
had
time
to
think
*NL*
when
,
moving
more
and
more
rapidly
,
the
oak
tree
vanished
behind
the
*NL*
other
trees
,
and
he
heard
the
crash
of
the
great
tree
falling
upon
the
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flash
of
lightning
,
the
crash
of
thunder
,
and
the
instantaneous
*NL*
chill
that
ran
through
him
were
all
merged
for
Levin
in
one
sense
of
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God
!
my
God
!
not
on
them
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
though
he
thought
at
once
how
senseless
was
his
prayer
that
they
*NL*
should
not
have
been
killed
by
the
oak
which
had
fallen
now
,
he
repeated
*NL*
it
,
knowing
that
he
could
do
nothing
better
than
utter
this
senseless
*NL*
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Running
up
to
the
place
where
they
usually
went
,
he
did
not
find
them
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
copse
under
an
old
lime-tree
;
they
*NL*
were
calling
him
.
Two
figures
in
dark
dresses
-LRB-
they
had
been
light
*NL*
summer
dresses
when
they
started
out
-RRB-
were
standing
bending
over
*NL*
something
.
It
was
Kitty
with
the
nurse
.
The
rain
was
already
ceasing
,
*NL*
and
it
was
beginning
to
get
light
when
Levin
reached
them
.
The
nurse
was
*NL*
not
wet
on
the
lower
part
of
her
dress
,
but
Kitty
was
drenched
through
,
*NL*
and
her
soaked
clothes
clung
to
her
.
Though
the
rain
was
over
,
they
*NL*
still
stood
in
the
same
position
in
which
they
had
been
standing
when
*NL*
the
storm
broke
.
Both
stood
bending
over
a
perambulator
with
a
green
*NL*
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alive
?
Unhurt
?
Thank
God
!
''
he

,
splashing
with
his
soaked
boots
*NL*
through
the
standing
water
and
running
up
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
rosy
wet
face
was
turned
towards
him
,
and
she
smiled
timidly
*NL*
under
her
shapeless
sopped
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
ashamed
of
yourself
?
I
ca
n't
think
how
you
can
be
so
*NL*
reckless
!
''
he
said
angrily
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
my
fault
,
really
.
We
were
just
meaning
to
go
,
when
he
made
*NL*
such
a
to-do
that
we
had
to
change
him
.
We
were
just
...
''
Kitty
began
*NL*
defending
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
was
unharmed
,
dry
,
and
still
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
thank
God
!
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
saying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
gathered
up
the
baby
's
wet
belongings
;
the
nurse
picked
up
the
baby
*NL*
and
carried
it
.
Levin
walked
beside
his
wife
,
and
,
penitent
for
having
*NL*
been
angry
,
he
squeezed
her
hand
when
the
nurse
was
not
looking
.

*NL*
During
the
whole
of
that
day
,
in
the
extremely
different
conversations
*NL*
in
which
he
took
part
,
only
as
it
were
with
the
top
layer
of
his
mind
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
disappointment
of
not
finding
the
change
he
expected
in
*NL*
himself
,
Levin
had
been
all
the
while
joyfully
conscious
of
the
fulness
*NL*
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
rain
it
was
too
wet
to
go
for
a
walk
;
besides
,
the
storm
*NL*
clouds
still
hung
about
the
horizon
,
and
gathered
here
and
there
,
black
*NL*
and
thundery
,
on
the
rim
of
the
sky
.
The
whole
party
spent
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
day
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
discussions
sprang
up
;
on
the
contrary
,
after
dinner
every
one
*NL*
was
in
the
most
amiable
frame
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Katavasov
amused
the
ladies
by
his
original
jokes
,
which
always
*NL*
pleased
people
on
their
first
acquaintance
with
him
.
Then
Sergey
*NL*
Ivanovitch
induced
him
to
tell
them
about
the
very
interesting
*NL*
observations
he
had
made
on
the
habits
and
characteristics
of
common
*NL*
houseflies
,
and
their
life
.
Sergey
Ivanovitch
,
too
,
was
in
good
spirits
,
*NL*
and
at
tea
his
brother
drew
him
on
to
explain
his
views
of
the
future
of
*NL*
the
Eastern
question
,
and
he
spoke
so
simply
and
so
well
,
that
everyone
*NL*
listened
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
hear
it
all
--
she
was
summoned
to
give
*NL*
Mitya
his
bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
after
Kitty
had
left
the
room
she
sent
for
Levin
to
come
*NL*
to
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
his
tea
,
and
regretfully
interrupting
the
interesting
*NL*
conversation
,
and
at
the
same
time
uneasily
wondering
why
he
had
been
*NL*
sent
for
,
as
this
only
happened
on
important
occasions
,
Levin
went
to
*NL*
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
had
been
much
interested
by
Sergey
Ivanovitch
's
views
of
the
*NL*
new
epoch
in
history
that
would
be
created
by
the
emancipation
of
forty
*NL*
millions
of
men
of
Slavonic
race
acting
with
Russia
,
a
conception
quite
*NL*
new
to
him
,
and
although
he
was
disturbed
by
uneasy
wonder
at
being
sent
*NL*
for
by
Kitty
,
as
soon
as
he
came
out
of
the
drawing
room
and
was
alone
,
*NL*
his
mind
reverted
at
once
to
the
thoughts
of
the
morning
.
And
all
the
*NL*
theories
of
the
significance
of
the
Slav
element
in
the
history
of
the
*NL*
world
seemed
to
him
so
trivial
compared
with
what
was
passing
in
his
own
*NL*
soul
,
that
he
instantly
forgot
it
all
and
dropped
back
into
the
same
*NL*
frame
of
mind
that
he
had
been
in
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
,
as
he
had
done
at
other
times
,
recall
the
whole
train
of
*NL*
thought
--
that
he
did
not
need
.
He
fell
back
at
once
into
the
feeling
*NL*
which
had
guided
him
,
which
was
connected
with
those
thoughts
,
and
he
*NL*
found
that
feeling
in
his
soul
even
stronger
and
more
definite
than
*NL*
before
.
He
did
not
,
as
he
had
had
to
do
with
previous
attempts
to
find
*NL*
comforting
arguments
,
need
to
revive
a
whole
chain
of
thought
to
find
*NL*
the
feeling
.
Now
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
feeling
of
joy
and
peace
was
*NL*
keener
than
ever
,
and
thought
could
not
keep
pace
with
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
across
the
terrace
and
looked
at
two
stars
that
had
come
out
*NL*
in
the
darkening
sky
,
and
suddenly
he
remembered
.
``
Yes
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
sky
,
I
thought
that
the
dome
that
I
see
is
not
a
deception
,
and
then
I
*NL*
thought
something
,
I
shirked
facing
something
,
''
he
mused
.
``
But
whatever
*NL*
it
was
,
there
can
be
no
disproving
it
!
I
have
but
to
think
,
and
all
will
*NL*
come
clear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
was
going
into
the
nursery
he
remembered
what
it
was
he
had
*NL*
shirked
facing
.
It
was
that
if
the
chief
proof
of
the
Divinity
was
His
*NL*
revelation
of
what
is
right
,
how
is
it
this
revelation
is
confined
to
*NL*
the
Christian
church
alone
?
What
relation
to
this
revelation
have
the
*NL*
beliefs
of
the
Buddhists
,
Mohammedans
,
who
preached
and
did
good
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
an
answer
to
this
question
;
but
he
had
not
*NL*
time
to
formulate
it
to
himself
before
he
went
into
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
was
standing
with
her
sleeves
tucked
up
over
the
baby
in
the
bath
.
*NL*
Hearing
her
husband
's
footstep
,
she
turned
towards
him
,
summoning
him
to
*NL*
her
with
her
smile
.
With
one
hand
she
was
supporting
the
fat
baby
that
*NL*
lay
floating
and
sprawling
on
its
back
,
while
with
the
other
she
*NL*
squeezed
the
sponge
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
look
,
look
!
''
she
said
,
when
her
husband
came
up
to
her
.
``
Agafea
*NL*
Mihalovna
's
right
.
He
knows
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mitya
had
on
that
day
given
unmistakable
,
incontestable
signs
of
*NL*
recognizing
all
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Levin
approached
the
bath
,
the
experiment
was
tried
,
and
it
*NL*
was
completely
successful
.
The
cook
,
sent
for
with
this
object
,
bent
*NL*
over
the
baby
.
He
frowned
and
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
.
Kitty
bent
*NL*
down
to
him
,
he
gave
her
a
beaming
smile
,
propped
his
little
hands
on
*NL*
the
sponge
and
chirruped
,
making
such
a
queer
little
contented
sound
*NL*
with
his
lips
,
that
Kitty
and
the
nurse
were
not
alone
in
their
*NL*
admiration
.
Levin
,
too
,
was
surprised
and
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baby
was
taken
out
of
the
bath
,
drenched
with
water
,
wrapped
in
*NL*
towels
,
dried
,
and
after
a
piercing
scream
,
handed
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
glad
you
are
beginning
to
love
him
,
''
said
Kitty
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
when
she
had
settled
herself
comfortably
in
her
usual
place
,
*NL*
with
the
baby
at
her
breast
.
``
I
am
so
glad
!
It
had
begun
to
distress
me
.
*NL*
You
said
you
had
no
feeling
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
did
I
say
that
?
I
only
said
I
was
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
disappointed
in
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
disappointed
in
him
,
but
in
my
own
feeling
;
I
had
expected
more
.
I
*NL*
had
expected
a
rush
of
new
delightful
emotion
to
come
as
a
surprise
.
And
*NL*
then
instead
of
that
--
disgust
,
pity
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
attentively
,
looking
at
him
over
the
baby
,
while
she
put
*NL*
back
on
her
slender
fingers
the
rings
she
had
taken
off
while
giving
*NL*
Mitya
his
bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
most
of
all
,
at
there
being
far
more
apprehension
and
pity
than
*NL*
pleasure
.
Today
,
after
that
fright
during
the
storm
,
I
understand
how
I
*NL*
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kitty
's
smile
was
radiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
very
much
frightened
?
''
she
said
.
``
So
was
I
too
,
but
I
feel
it
*NL*
more
now
that
it
's
over
.
I
'm
going
to
look
at
the
oak

How
nice
*NL*
Katavasov
is

And
what
a
happy
day
we
've
had
altogether

And
you
're
so

nice

Sergey
Ivanovitch

when
you
care
to
be

Well

go
back

steamy
here

*NL*
Going
out
of
the
nursery
and
being
again
alone
,
Levin
went
back
at
once
*NL*
to
the
thought
,
in
which
there
was
something
not
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
going
into
the
drawing
room
,
where
he
heard
voices
,
he
*NL*
stopped
on
the
terrace
,
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
parapet
,
he
gazed
*NL*
up
at
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
dark
now
,
and
in
the
south
,
where
he
was
looking
,
there
*NL*
were
no
clouds
.
The
storm
had
drifted
on
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
there
were
flashes
of
lightning
and
distant
thunder
from
that
*NL*
quarter
.
Levin
listened
to
the
monotonous
drip
from
the
lime
trees
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
looked
at
the
triangle
of
stars
he
knew
so
well
,
and
the
*NL*
Milky
Way
with
its
branches
that
ran
through
its
midst
.
At
each
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
the
Milky
Way
,
and
even
the
bright
stars
,
vanished
,
but
as
*NL*
soon
as
the
lightning
died
away
,
they
reappeared
in
their
places
as
*NL*
though
some
hand
had
flung
them
back
with
careful
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
perplexes
me
?
''
Levin
said
to
himself
,
feeling
*NL*
beforehand
that
the
solution
of
his
difficulties
was
ready
in
his
soul
,
*NL*
though
he
did
not
know
it
yet
.
``
Yes
,
the
one
unmistakable
,
incontestable
*NL*
manifestation
of
the
Divinity
is
the
law
of
right
and
wrong
,
which
has
*NL*
come
into
the
world
by
revelation
,
and
which
I
feel
in
myself
,
and
in
*NL*
the
recognition
of
which
--
I
do
n't
make
myself
,
but
whether
I
will
or
*NL*
not
--
I
am
made
one
with
other
men
in
one
body
of
believers
,
which
is
*NL*
called
the
church
.
Well
,
but
the
Jews
,
the
Mohammedans
,
the
Confucians
,
*NL*
the
Buddhists
--
what
of
them
?
''
he
put
to
himself
the
question
he
had
*NL*
feared
to
face
.
``
Can
these
hundreds
of
millions
of
men
be
deprived
of
*NL*
that
highest
blessing
without
which
life
has
no
meaning
?
''
He
pondered
a
*NL*
moment
,
but
immediately
corrected
himself
.
``
But
what
am
I
questioning
?
''
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
.
``
I
am
questioning
the
relation
to
Divinity
of
all
*NL*
the
different
religions
of
all
mankind
.
I
am
questioning
the
universal
*NL*
manifestation
of
God
to
all
the
world
with
all
those
misty
blurs
.
What
*NL*
am
I
about
?
To
me
individually
,
to
my
heart
has
been
revealed
a
*NL*
knowledge
beyond
all
doubt
,
and
unattainable
by
reason
,
and
here
I
am
*NL*
obstinately
trying
to
express
that
knowledge
in
reason
and
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
know
that
the
stars
do
n't
move
?
''
he
asked
himself
,
gazing
at
*NL*
the
bright
planet
which
had
shifted
its
position
up
to
the
topmost
twig
*NL*
of
the
birch-tree
.
``
But
looking
at
the
movements
of
the
stars
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
picture
to
myself
the
rotation
of
the
earth
,
and
I
'm
right
in
saying
*NL*
that
the
stars
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
could
the
astronomers
have
understood
and
calculated
anything
,
if
*NL*
they
had
taken
into
account
all
the
complicated
and
varied
motions
of
*NL*
the
earth
?
All
the
marvelous
conclusions
they
have
reached
about
the
*NL*
distances
,
weights
,
movements
,
and
deflections
of
the
heavenly
bodies
*NL*
are
only
founded
on
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
about
a
*NL*
stationary
earth
,
on
that
very
motion
I
see
before
me
now
,
which
has
*NL*
been
so
for
millions
of
men
during
long
ages
,
and
was
and
will
be
always
*NL*
alike
,
and
can
always
be
trusted
.
And
just
as
the
conclusions
of
the
*NL*
astronomers
would
have
been
vain
and
uncertain
if
not
founded
on
*NL*
observations
of
the
seen
heavens
,
in
relation
to
a
single
meridian
and
a
*NL*
single
horizon
,
so
would
my
conclusions
be
vain
and
uncertain
if
not
*NL*
founded
on
that
conception
of
right
,
which
has
been
and
will
be
always
*NL*
alike
for
all
men
,
which
has
been
revealed
to
me
as
a
Christian
,
and
*NL*
which
can
always
be
trusted
in
my
soul
.
The
question
of
other
religions
*NL*
and
their
relations
to
Divinity
I
have
no
right
to
decide
,
and
no
*NL*
possibility
of
deciding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
have
n't
gone
in
then
?
''
he
heard
Kitty
's
voice
all
at
once
,
as
*NL*
she
came
by
the
same
way
to
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
you
're
not
worried
about
anything
?
''
she
said
,
looking
*NL*
intently
at
his
face
in
the
starlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
not
have
seen
his
face
if
a
flash
of
lightning
had
not
*NL*
hidden
the
stars
and
revealed
it
.
In
that
flash
she
saw
his
face
*NL*
distinctly
,
and
seeing
him
calm
and
happy
,
she
smiled
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
understands

''
he
thought
;
``
she

Shall

I

Yes

But
at
the
moment
he
was
about
*NL*
to
speak
,
she
began
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kostya
!
do
something
for
me
,
''
she
said
;
``
go
into
the
corner
room
and
*NL*
see
if
they
've
made
it
all
right
for
Sergey
Ivanovitch
.
I
ca
n't
very
*NL*
well
.
See
if
they
've
put
the
new
wash
stand
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
'll
go
directly
,
''
said
Levin
,
standing
up
and
kissing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'd
better
not
speak
of
it
,
''
he
thought
,
when
she
had
gone
in
*NL*
before
him
.
``
It
is
a
secret
for
me
alone
,
of
vital
importance
for
me
,
*NL*
and
not
to
be
put
into
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
new
feeling
has
not
changed
me
,
has
not
made
me
happy
and
*NL*
enlightened
all
of
a
sudden
,
as
I
had
dreamed
,
just
like
the
feeling
for
*NL*
my
child
.
There
was
no
surprise
in
this
either
.
Faith
--
or
not
faith
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
it
is
--
but
this
feeling
has
come
just
as
imperceptibly
*NL*
through
suffering
,
and
has
taken
firm
root
in
my
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
on
in
the
same
way
,
losing
my
temper
with
Ivan
the
coachman
,
*NL*
falling
into
angry
discussions
,
expressing
my
opinions
tactlessly
;
there
*NL*
will
be
still
the
same
wall
between
the
holy
of
holies
of
my
soul
and
*NL*
other
people
,
even
my
wife
;
I
shall
still
go
on
scolding
her
for
my
own
*NL*
terror
,
and
being
remorseful
for
it
;
I
shall
still
be
as
unable
to
*NL*
understand
with
my
reason
why
I
pray
,
and
I
shall
still
go
on
praying
;
*NL*
but
my
life
now
,
my
whole
life
apart
from
anything
that
can
happen
to
*NL*
me
,
every
minute
of
it
is
no
more
meaningless
,
as
it
was
before
,
but
it
*NL*
has
the
positive
meaning
of
goodness
,
which
I
have
the
power
to
put
into
*NL*
it
.
