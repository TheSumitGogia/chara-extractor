CHAPTER
I.
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
is
Surprised
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
lived
just
where
the
Avonlea
main
road
dipped
down
*NL*
into
a
little
hollow
,
fringed
with
alders
and
ladies
'
eardrops
and
*NL*
traversed
by
a
brook
that
had
its
source
away
back
in
the
woods
of
the
*NL*
old
Cuthbert
place
;
it
was
reputed
to
be
an
intricate
,
headlong
brook
*NL*
in
its
earlier
course
through
those
woods
,
with
dark
secrets
of
pool
*NL*
and
cascade
;
but
by
the
time
it
reached
Lynde
's
Hollow
it
was
a
quiet
,
*NL*
well-conducted
little
stream
,
for
not
even
a
brook
could
run
past
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
Lynde
's
door
without
due
regard
for
decency
and
decorum
;
it
*NL*
probably
was
conscious
that
Mrs.
Rachel
was
sitting
at
her
window
,
*NL*
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
everything
that
passed
,
from
brooks
and
children
*NL*
up
,
and
that
if
she
noticed
anything
odd
or
out
of
place
she
would
never
*NL*
rest
until
she
had
ferreted
out
the
whys
and
wherefores
thereof
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
plenty
of
people
in
Avonlea
and
out
of
it
,
who
can
attend
*NL*
closely
to
their
neighbor
's
business
by
dint
of
neglecting
their
own
;
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
was
one
of
those
capable
creatures
who
can
manage
*NL*
their
own
concerns
and
those
of
other
folks
into
the
bargain
.
She
was
a
*NL*
notable
housewife
;
her
work
was
always
done
and
well
done
;
she
``
ran
''
the
*NL*
Sewing
Circle
,
helped
run
the
Sunday-school
,
and
was
the
strongest
prop
*NL*
of
the
Church
Aid
Society
and
Foreign
Missions
Auxiliary
.
Yet
with
all
*NL*
this
Mrs.
Rachel
found
abundant
time
to
sit
for
hours
at
her
kitchen
*NL*
window
,
knitting
``
cotton
warp
''
quilts
--
she
had
knitted
sixteen
of
them
,
*NL*
as
Avonlea
housekeepers
were
wont
to
tell
in
awed
voices
--
and
keeping
*NL*
a
sharp
eye
on
the
main
road
that
crossed
the
hollow
and
wound
up
*NL*
the
steep
red
hill
beyond
.
Since
Avonlea
occupied
a
little
triangular
*NL*
peninsula
jutting
out
into
the
Gulf
of
St.
Lawrence
with
water
on
two
*NL*
sides
of
it
,
anybody
who
went
out
of
it
or
into
it
had
to
pass
over
that
*NL*
hill
road
and
so
run
the
unseen
gauntlet
of
Mrs.
Rachel
's
all-seeing
*NL*
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
there
one
afternoon
in
early
June
.
The
sun
was
coming
in
*NL*
at
the
window
warm
and
bright
;
the
orchard
on
the
slope
below
the
house
*NL*
was
in
a
bridal
flush
of
pinky-white
bloom
,
hummed
over
by
a
myriad
of
*NL*
bees
.
Thomas
Lynde
--
a
meek
little
man
whom
Avonlea
people
called
``
Rachel
*NL*
Lynde
's
husband
''
--
was
sowing
his
late
turnip
seed
on
the
hill
field
*NL*
beyond
the
barn
;
and
Matthew
Cuthbert
ought
to
have
been
sowing
his
on
*NL*
the
big
red
brook
field
away
over
by
Green
Gables
.
Mrs.
Rachel
knew
*NL*
that
he
ought
because
she
had
heard
him
tell
Peter
Morrison
the
evening
*NL*
before
in
William
J.
Blair
's
store
over
at
Carmody
that
he
meant
to
sow
*NL*
his
turnip
seed
the
next
afternoon
.
Peter
had
asked
him
,
of
course
,
for
*NL*
Matthew
Cuthbert
had
never
been
known
to
volunteer
information
about
*NL*
anything
in
his
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
here
was
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
at
half-past
three
on
the
afternoon
*NL*
of
a
busy
day
,
placidly
driving
over
the
hollow
and
up
the
hill
;
*NL*
moreover
,
he
wore
a
white
collar
and
his
best
suit
of
clothes
,
which
was
*NL*
plain
proof
that
he
was
going
out
of
Avonlea
;
and
he
had
the
buggy
*NL*
and
the
sorrel
mare
,
which
betokened
that
he
was
going
a
considerable
*NL*
distance
.
Now
,
where
was
Matthew
Cuthbert
going
and
why
was
he
going
*NL*
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
Had
it
been
any
other
man
in
Avonlea
,
Mrs.
Rachel
,
deftly
putting
this
*NL*
and
that
together
,
might
have
given
a
pretty
good
guess
as
to
both
*NL*
questions
.
But
Matthew
so
rarely
went
from
home
that
it
must
be
*NL*
something
pressing
and
unusual
which
was
taking
him
;
he
was
the
shyest
*NL*
man
alive
and
hated
to
have
to
go
among
strangers
or
to
any
place
where
*NL*
he
might
have
to
talk
.
Matthew
,
dressed
up
with
a
white
collar
and
*NL*
driving
in
a
buggy
,
was
something
that
did
n't
happen
often
.
Mrs.
Rachel
,
*NL*
ponder
as
she
might
,
could
make
nothing
of
it
and
her
afternoon
's
*NL*
enjoyment
was
spoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
step
over
to
Green
Gables
after
tea
and
find
out
from
Marilla
*NL*
where
he
's
gone
and
why
,
''
the
worthy
woman
finally
concluded
.
``
He
*NL*
does
n't
generally
go
to
town
this
time
of
year
and
he
NEVER
visits
;
if
*NL*
he
'd
run
out
of
turnip
seed
he
would
n't
dress
up
and
take
the
buggy
to
*NL*
go
for
more
;
he
was
n't
driving
fast
enough
to
be
going
for
a
doctor
.
*NL*
Yet
something
must
have
happened
since
last
night
to
start
him
off
.
I
'm
*NL*
clean
puzzled
,
that
's
what
,
and
I
wo
n't
know
a
minute
's
peace
of
mind
or
*NL*
conscience
until
I
know
what
has
taken
Matthew
Cuthbert
out
of
Avonlea
*NL*
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
after
tea
Mrs.
Rachel
set
out
;
she
had
not
far
to
go
;
the
*NL*
big
,
rambling
,
orchard-embowered
house
where
the
Cuthberts
lived
was
a
*NL*
scant
quarter
of
a
mile
up
the
road
from
Lynde
's
Hollow
.
To
be
sure
,
the
*NL*
long
lane
made
it
a
good
deal
further
.
Matthew
Cuthbert
's
father
,
as
*NL*
shy
and
silent
as
his
son
after
him
,
had
got
as
far
away
as
he
possibly
*NL*
could
from
his
fellow
men
without
actually
retreating
into
the
woods
*NL*
when
he
founded
his
homestead
.
Green
Gables
was
built
at
the
furthest
*NL*
edge
of
his
cleared
land
and
there
it
was
to
this
day
,
barely
visible
*NL*
from
the
main
road
along
which
all
the
other
Avonlea
houses
were
so
*NL*
sociably
situated
.
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
did
not
call
living
in
such
a
place
*NL*
LIVING
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
STAYING
,
that
's
what
,
''
she
said
as
she
stepped
along
the
*NL*
deep-rutted
,
grassy
lane
bordered
with
wild
rose
bushes
.
``
It
's
no
wonder
*NL*
Matthew
and
Marilla
are
both
a
little
odd
,
living
away
back
here
by
*NL*
themselves
.
Trees
are
n't
much
company
,
though
dear
knows
if
they
were
*NL*
there
'd
be
enough
of
them
.
I
'd
ruther
look
at
people
.
To
be
sure
,
they
*NL*
seem
contented
enough
;
but
then
,
I
suppose
,
they
're
used
to
it
.
A
body
*NL*
can
get
used
to
anything
,
even
to
being
hanged
,
as
the
Irishman
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
Mrs.
Rachel
stepped
out
of
the
lane
into
the
backyard
of
Green
*NL*
Gables
.
Very
green
and
neat
and
precise
was
that
yard
,
set
about
on
one
*NL*
side
with
great
patriarchal
willows
and
the
other
with
prim
Lombardies
.
*NL*
Not
a
stray
stick
nor
stone
was
to
be
seen
,
for
Mrs.
Rachel
would
have
*NL*
seen
it
if
there
had
been
.
Privately
she
was
of
the
opinion
that
Marilla
*NL*
Cuthbert
swept
that
yard
over
as
often
as
she
swept
her
house
.
One
could
*NL*
have
eaten
a
meal
off
the
ground
without
overbrimming
the
proverbial
*NL*
peck
of
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
rapped
smartly
at
the
kitchen
door
and
stepped
in
*NL*
when
bidden
to
do
so
.
The
kitchen
at
Green
Gables
was
a
cheerful
*NL*
apartment
--
or
would
have
been
cheerful
if
it
had
not
been
so
painfully
*NL*
clean
as
to
give
it
something
of
the
appearance
of
an
unused
parlor
.
Its
*NL*
windows
looked
east
and
west
;
through
the
west
one
,
looking
out
on
*NL*
the
back
yard
,
came
a
flood
of
mellow
June
sunlight
;
but
the
east
one
,
*NL*
whence
you
got
a
glimpse
of
the
bloom
white
cherry-trees
in
the
left
*NL*
orchard
and
nodding
,
slender
birches
down
in
the
hollow
by
the
brook
,
*NL*
was
greened
over
by
a
tangle
of
vines
.
Here
sat
Marilla
Cuthbert
,
when
*NL*
she
sat
at
all
,
always
slightly
distrustful
of
sunshine
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
her
too
dancing
and
irresponsible
a
thing
for
a
world
which
was
meant
to
*NL*
be
taken
seriously
;
and
here
she
sat
now
,
knitting
,
and
the
table
behind
*NL*
her
was
laid
for
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
,
before
she
had
fairly
closed
the
door
,
had
taken
a
mental
*NL*
note
of
everything
that
was
on
that
table
.
There
were
three
plates
laid
,
*NL*
so
that
Marilla
must
be
expecting
some
one
home
with
Matthew
to
tea
;
but
*NL*
the
dishes
were
everyday
dishes
and
there
was
only
crab-apple
preserves
*NL*
and
one
kind
of
cake
,
so
that
the
expected
company
could
not
be
any
*NL*
particular
company
.
Yet
what
of
Matthew
's
white
collar
and
the
sorrel
*NL*
mare
?
Mrs.
Rachel
was
getting
fairly
dizzy
with
this
unusual
mystery
*NL*
about
quiet
,
unmysterious
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Rachel
,
''
Marilla
said
briskly
.
``
This
is
a
real
fine
*NL*
evening
,
is
n't
it
?
Wo
n't
you
sit
down
?
How
are
all
your
folks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
that
for
lack
of
any
other
name
might
be
called
friendship
*NL*
existed
and
always
had
existed
between
Marilla
Cuthbert
and
Mrs.
Rachel
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
--
or
perhaps
because
of
--
their
dissimilarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
was
a
tall
,
thin
woman
,
with
angles
and
without
curves
;
her
dark
*NL*
hair
showed
some
gray
streaks
and
was
always
twisted
up
in
a
hard
little
*NL*
knot
behind
with
two
wire
hairpins
stuck
aggressively
through
it
.
She
*NL*
looked
like
a
woman
of
narrow
experience
and
rigid
conscience
,
which
she
*NL*
was
;
but
there
was
a
saving
something
about
her
mouth
which
,
if
it
had
*NL*
been
ever
so
slightly
developed
,
might
have
been
considered
indicative
*NL*
of
a
sense
of
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
all
pretty
well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rachel
.
``
I
was
kind
of
afraid
YOU
*NL*
were
n't
,
though
,
when
I
saw
Matthew
starting
off
today
.
I
thought
maybe
*NL*
he
was
going
to
the
doctor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
's
lips
twitched
understandingly
.
She
had
expected
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
up
;
she
had
known
that
the
sight
of
Matthew
jaunting
off
so
*NL*
unaccountably
would
be
too
much
for
her
neighbor
's
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
quite
well
although
I
had
a
bad
headache
yesterday
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
Matthew
went
to
Bright
River
.
We
're
getting
a
little
boy
from
an
*NL*
orphan
asylum
in
Nova
Scotia
and
he
's
coming
on
the
train
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Marilla
had
said
that
Matthew
had
gone
to
Bright
River
to
meet
a
*NL*
kangaroo
from
Australia
Mrs.
Rachel
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
.
*NL*
She
was
actually
stricken
dumb
for
five
seconds
.
It
was
unsupposable
*NL*
that
Marilla
was
making
fun
of
her
,
but
Mrs.
Rachel
was
almost
forced
to
*NL*
suppose
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
in
earnest
,
Marilla
?
''
she
demanded
when
voice
returned
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
''
said
Marilla
,
as
if
getting
boys
from
orphan
asylums
*NL*
in
Nova
Scotia
were
part
of
the
usual
spring
work
on
any
well-regulated
*NL*
Avonlea
farm
instead
of
being
an
unheard
of
innovation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
felt
that
she
had
received
a
severe
mental
jolt
.
She
thought
*NL*
in
exclamation
points
.
A
boy
!
Marilla
and
Matthew
Cuthbert
of
all
people
*NL*
adopting
a
boy
!
From
an
orphan
asylum
!
Well
,
the
world
was
certainly
*NL*
turning
upside
down
!
She
would
be
surprised
at
nothing
after
this
!
*NL*
Nothing
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
put
such
a
notion
into
your
head
?
''
she
demanded
*NL*
disapprovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
done
without
her
advice
being
asked
,
and
must
perforce
be
*NL*
disapproved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
've
been
thinking
about
it
for
some
time
--
all
winter
in
fact
,
''
*NL*
returned
Marilla
.
``
Mrs.
Alexander
Spencer
was
up
here
one
day
before
*NL*
Christmas
and
she
said
she
was
going
to
get
a
little
girl
from
the
*NL*
asylum
over
in
Hopeton
in
the
spring
.
Her
cousin
lives
there
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Spencer
has
visited
here
and
knows
all
about
it
.
So
Matthew
and
I
have
*NL*
talked
it
over
off
and
on
ever
since
.
We
thought
we
'd
get
a
boy
.
Matthew
*NL*
is
getting
up
in
years
,
you
know
--
he
's
sixty
--
and
he
is
n't
so
spry
as
he
*NL*
once
was
.
His
heart
troubles
him
a
good
deal
.
And
you
know
how
desperate
*NL*
hard
it
's
got
to
be
to
get
hired
help
.
There
's
never
anybody
to
be
had
*NL*
but
those
stupid
,
half-grown
little
French
boys
;
and
as
soon
as
you
do
*NL*
get
one
broke
into
your
ways
and
taught
something
he
's
up
and
off
to
the
*NL*
lobster
canneries
or
the
States
.
At
first
Matthew
suggested
getting
a
*NL*
Home
boy
.
But
I
said
`
no
'
flat
to
that
.
`
They
may
be
all
right
--
I
'm
not
*NL*
saying
they
're
not
--
but
no
London
street
Arabs
for
me
,
'
I
said
.
`
Give
*NL*
me
a
native
born
at
least
.
There
'll
be
a
risk
,
no
matter
who
we
get
.
But
*NL*
I
'll
feel
easier
in
my
mind
and
sleep
sounder
at
nights
if
we
get
a
born
*NL*
Canadian
.
'
So
in
the
end
we
decided
to
ask
Mrs.
Spencer
to
pick
us
out
*NL*
one
when
she
went
over
to
get
her
little
girl
.
We
heard
last
week
she
*NL*
was
going
,
so
we
sent
her
word
by
Richard
Spencer
's
folks
at
Carmody
*NL*
to
bring
us
a
smart
,
likely
boy
of
about
ten
or
eleven
.
We
decided
that
*NL*
would
be
the
best
age
--
old
enough
to
be
of
some
use
in
doing
chores
*NL*
right
off
and
young
enough
to
be
trained
up
proper
.
We
mean
to
give
him
*NL*
a
good
home
and
schooling
.
We
had
a
telegram
from
Mrs.
Alexander
Spencer
*NL*
today
--
the
mail-man
brought
it
from
the
station
--
saying
they
were
coming
*NL*
on
the
five-thirty
train
tonight
.
So
Matthew
went
to
Bright
River
to
*NL*
meet
him
.
Mrs.
Spencer
will
drop
him
off
there
.
Of
course
she
goes
on
to
*NL*
White
Sands
station
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
prided
herself
on
always
speaking
her
mind
;
she
proceeded
to
*NL*
speak
it
now
,
having
adjusted
her
mental
attitude
to
this
amazing
piece
*NL*
of
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Marilla
,
I
'll
just
tell
you
plain
that
I
think
you
're
doing
a
*NL*
mighty
foolish
thing
--
a
risky
thing
,
that
's
what
.
You
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
you
're
getting
.
You
're
bringing
a
strange
child
into
your
house
and
home
*NL*
and
you
do
n't
know
a
single
thing
about
him
nor
what
his
disposition
is
*NL*
like
nor
what
sort
of
parents
he
had
nor
how
he
's
likely
to
turn
out
.
*NL*
Why
,
it
was
only
last
week
I
read
in
the
paper
how
a
man
and
his
wife
up
*NL*
west
of
the
Island
took
a
boy
out
of
an
orphan
asylum
and
he
set
fire
to
*NL*
the
house
at
night
--
set
it
ON
PURPOSE
,
Marilla
--
and
nearly
burnt
them
to
*NL*
a
crisp
in
their
beds
.
And
I
know
another
case
where
an
adopted
boy
used
*NL*
to
suck
the
eggs
--
they
could
n't
break
him
of
it
.
If
you
had
asked
my
*NL*
advice
in
the
matter
--
which
you
did
n't
do
,
Marilla
--
I
'd
have
said
for
*NL*
mercy
's
sake
not
to
think
of
such
a
thing
,
that
's
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
Job
's
comforting
seemed
neither
to
offend
nor
to
alarm
Marilla
.
She
*NL*
knitted
steadily
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deny
there
's
something
in
what
you
say
,
Rachel
.
I
've
had
some
*NL*
qualms
myself
.
But
Matthew
was
terrible
set
on
it
.
I
could
see
that
,
so
*NL*
I
gave
in
.
It
's
so
seldom
Matthew
sets
his
mind
on
anything
that
when
he
*NL*
does
I
always
feel
it
's
my
duty
to
give
in
.
And
as
for
the
risk
,
there
's
*NL*
risks
in
pretty
near
everything
a
body
does
in
this
world
.
There
's
risks
*NL*
in
people
's
having
children
of
their
own
if
it
comes
to
that
--
they
do
n't
*NL*
always
turn
out
well
.
And
then
Nova
Scotia
is
right
close
to
the
Island
.
*NL*
It
is
n't
as
if
we
were
getting
him
from
England
or
the
States
.
He
ca
n't
*NL*
be
much
different
from
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
it
will
turn
out
all
right
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rachel
in
a
tone
*NL*
that
plainly
indicated
her
painful
doubts
.
``
Only
do
n't
say
I
did
n't
*NL*
warn
you
if
he
burns
Green
Gables
down
or
puts
strychnine
in
the
well
--
I
*NL*
heard
of
a
case
over
in
New
Brunswick
where
an
orphan
asylum
child
did
*NL*
that
and
the
whole
family
died
in
fearful
agonies
.
Only
,
it
was
a
girl
*NL*
in
that
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
're
not
getting
a
girl
,
''
said
Marilla
,
as
if
poisoning
wells
*NL*
were
a
purely
feminine
accomplishment
and
not
to
be
dreaded
in
the
case
*NL*
of
a
boy
.
``
I
'd
never
dream
of
taking
a
girl
to
bring
up
.
I
wonder
at
*NL*
Mrs.
Alexander
Spencer
for
doing
it
.
But
there
,
SHE
would
n't
shrink
from
*NL*
adopting
a
whole
orphan
asylum
if
she
took
it
into
her
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
would
have
liked
to
stay
until
Matthew
came
home
with
his
*NL*
imported
orphan
.
But
reflecting
that
it
would
be
a
good
two
hours
at
*NL*
least
before
his
arrival
she
concluded
to
go
up
the
road
to
Robert
*NL*
Bell
's
and
tell
the
news
.
It
would
certainly
make
a
sensation
second
*NL*
to
none
,
and
Mrs.
Rachel
dearly
loved
to
make
a
sensation
.
So
she
took
*NL*
herself
away
,
somewhat
to
Marilla
's
relief
,
for
the
latter
felt
*NL*
her
doubts
and
fears
reviving
under
the
influence
of
Mrs.
Rachel
's
*NL*
pessimism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
of
all
things
that
ever
were
or
will
be
!
''
ejaculated
Mrs.
Rachel
*NL*
when
she
was
safely
out
in
the
lane
.
``
It
does
really
seem
as
if
I
must
*NL*
be
dreaming
.
Well
,
I
'm
sorry
for
that
poor
young
one
and
no
mistake
.
*NL*
Matthew
and
Marilla
do
n't
know
anything
about
children
and
they
'll
*NL*
expect
him
to
be
wiser
and
steadier
that
his
own
grandfather
,
if
so
be
's
*NL*
he
ever
had
a
grandfather
,
which
is
doubtful
.
It
seems
uncanny
to
think
*NL*
of
a
child
at
Green
Gables
somehow
;
there
's
never
been
one
there
,
for
*NL*
Matthew
and
Marilla
were
grown
up
when
the
new
house
was
built
--
if
they
*NL*
ever
WERE
children
,
which
is
hard
to
believe
when
one
looks
at
them
.
*NL*
I
would
n't
be
in
that
orphan
's
shoes
for
anything
.
My
,
but
I
pity
him
,
*NL*
that
's
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
said
Mrs.
Rachel
to
the
wild
rose
bushes
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
*NL*
heart
;
but
if
she
could
have
seen
the
child
who
was
waiting
patiently
*NL*
at
the
Bright
River
station
at
that
very
moment
her
pity
would
have
been
*NL*
still
deeper
and
more
profound
.

CHAPTER
II
.
Matthew
Cuthbert
is
surprised
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
Cuthbert
and
the
sorrel
mare
jogged
comfortably
over
the
eight
*NL*
miles
to
Bright
River
.
It
was
a
pretty
road
,
running
along
between
*NL*
snug
farmsteads
,
with
now
and
again
a
bit
of
balsamy
fir
wood
to
drive
*NL*
through
or
a
hollow
where
wild
plums
hung
out
their
filmy
bloom
.
The
air
*NL*
was
sweet
with
the
breath
of
many
apple
orchards
and
the
meadows
sloped
*NL*
away
in
the
distance
to
horizon
mists
of
pearl
and
purple
;
while
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
birds
sang
as
if
it
were
*NL*
The
one
day
of
summer
in
all
the
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
enjoyed
the
drive
after
his
own
fashion
,
except
during
the
*NL*
moments
when
he
met
women
and
had
to
nod
to
them
--
for
in
Prince
Edward
*NL*
island
you
are
supposed
to
nod
to
all
and
sundry
you
meet
on
the
road
*NL*
whether
you
know
them
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
dreaded
all
women
except
Marilla
and
Mrs.
Rachel
;
he
had
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
feeling
that
the
mysterious
creatures
were
secretly
*NL*
laughing
at
him
.
He
may
have
been
quite
right
in
thinking
so
,
for
he
*NL*
was
an
odd-looking
personage
,
with
an
ungainly
figure
and
long
iron-gray
*NL*
hair
that
touched
his
stooping
shoulders
,
and
a
full
,
soft
brown
beard
*NL*
which
he
had
worn
ever
since
he
was
twenty
.
In
fact
,
he
had
looked
*NL*
at
twenty
very
much
as
he
looked
at
sixty
,
lacking
a
little
of
the
*NL*
grayness
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
Bright
River
there
was
no
sign
of
any
train
;
he
thought
*NL*
he
was
too
early
,
so
he
tied
his
horse
in
the
yard
of
the
small
Bright
*NL*
River
hotel
and
went
over
to
the
station
house
.
The
long
platform
was
*NL*
almost
deserted
;
the
only
living
creature
in
sight
being
a
girl
who
was
*NL*
sitting
on
a
pile
of
shingles
at
the
extreme
end
.
Matthew
,
barely
noting
*NL*
that
it
WAS
a
girl
,
sidled
past
her
as
quickly
as
possible
without
*NL*
looking
at
her
.
Had
he
looked
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
notice
the
*NL*
tense
rigidity
and
expectation
of
her
attitude
and
expression
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
there
waiting
for
something
or
somebody
and
,
since
sitting
and
*NL*
waiting
was
the
only
thing
to
do
just
then
,
she
sat
and
waited
with
all
*NL*
her
might
and
main
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
encountered
the
stationmaster
locking
up
the
ticket
office
*NL*
preparatory
to
going
home
for
supper
,
and
asked
him
if
the
five-thirty
*NL*
train
would
soon
be
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
five-thirty
train
has
been
in
and
gone
half
an
hour
ago
,
''
answered
*NL*
that
brisk
official
.
``
But
there
was
a
passenger
dropped
off
for
you
--
a
*NL*
little
girl
.
She
's
sitting
out
there
on
the
shingles
.
I
asked
her
to
*NL*
go
into
the
ladies
'
waiting
room
,
but
she
informed
me
gravely
that
she
*NL*
preferred
to
stay
outside
.
`
There
was
more
scope
for
imagination
,
'
she
*NL*
said
.
She
's
a
case
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
expecting
a
girl
,
''
said
Matthew
blankly
.
``
It
's
a
boy
I
've
come
*NL*
for
.
He
should
be
here
.
Mrs.
Alexander
Spencer
was
to
bring
him
over
*NL*
from
Nova
Scotia
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stationmaster
whistled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
there
's
some
mistake
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mrs.
Spencer
came
off
the
train
*NL*
with
that
girl
and
gave
her
into
my
charge
.
Said
you
and
your
sister
*NL*
were
adopting
her
from
an
orphan
asylum
and
that
you
would
be
along
for
*NL*
her
presently
.
That
's
all
I
know
about
it
--
and
I
have
n't
got
any
more
*NL*
orphans
concealed
hereabouts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
said
Matthew
helplessly
,
wishing
that
Marilla
was
*NL*
at
hand
to
cope
with
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'd
better
question
the
girl
,
''
said
the
station-master
*NL*
carelessly
.
``
I
dare
say
she
'll
be
able
to
explain
--
she
's
got
a
tongue
*NL*
of
her
own
,
that
's
certain
.
Maybe
they
were
out
of
boys
of
the
brand
you
*NL*
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
jauntily
away
,
being
hungry
,
and
the
unfortunate
Matthew
was
*NL*
left
to
do
that
which
was
harder
for
him
than
bearding
a
lion
in
its
*NL*
den
--
walk
up
to
a
girl
--
a
strange
girl
--
an
orphan
girl
--
and
demand
of
*NL*
her
why
she
was
n't
a
boy
.
Matthew
groaned
in
spirit
as
he
turned
about
*NL*
and
shuffled
gently
down
the
platform
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
watching
him
ever
since
he
had
passed
her
and
she
had
her
*NL*
eyes
on
him
now
.
Matthew
was
not
looking
at
her
and
would
not
have
seen
*NL*
what
she
was
really
like
if
he
had
been
,
but
an
ordinary
observer
would
*NL*
have
seen
this
:
A
child
of
about
eleven
,
garbed
in
a
very
short
,
very
*NL*
tight
,
very
ugly
dress
of
yellowish-gray
wincey
.
She
wore
a
faded
brown
*NL*
sailor
hat
and
beneath
the
hat
,
extending
down
her
back
,
were
two
braids
*NL*
of
very
thick
,
decidedly
red
hair
.
Her
face
was
small
,
white
and
thin
,
*NL*
also
much
freckled
;
her
mouth
was
large
and
so
were
her
eyes
,
which
*NL*
looked
green
in
some
lights
and
moods
and
gray
in
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
,
the
ordinary
observer
;
an
extraordinary
observer
might
have
seen
*NL*
that
the
chin
was
very
pointed
and
pronounced
;
that
the
big
eyes
*NL*
were
full
of
spirit
and
vivacity
;
that
the
mouth
was
sweet-lipped
*NL*
and
expressive
;
that
the
forehead
was
broad
and
full
;
in
short
,
*NL*
our
discerning
extraordinary
observer
might
have
concluded
that
no
*NL*
commonplace
soul
inhabited
the
body
of
this
stray
woman-child
of
whom
*NL*
shy
Matthew
Cuthbert
was
so
ludicrously
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
,
however
,
was
spared
the
ordeal
of
speaking
first
,
for
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
concluded
that
he
was
coming
to
her
she
stood
up
,
grasping
with
*NL*
one
thin
brown
hand
the
handle
of
a
shabby
,
old-fashioned
carpet-bag
;
*NL*
the
other
she
held
out
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
are
Mr.
Matthew
Cuthbert
of
Green
Gables
?
''
she
said
in
*NL*
a
peculiarly
clear
,
sweet
voice
.
``
I
'm
very
glad
to
see
you
.
I
was
*NL*
beginning
to
be
afraid
you
were
n't
coming
for
me
and
I
was
imagining
*NL*
all
the
things
that
might
have
happened
to
prevent
you
.
I
had
made
up
*NL*
my
mind
that
if
you
did
n't
come
for
me
to-night
I
'd
go
down
the
track
to
*NL*
that
big
wild
cherry-tree
at
the
bend
,
and
climb
up
into
it
to
stay
all
*NL*
night
.
I
would
n't
be
a
bit
afraid
,
and
it
would
be
lovely
to
sleep
in
a
*NL*
wild
cherry-tree
all
white
with
bloom
in
the
moonshine
,
do
n't
you
think
?
*NL*
You
could
imagine
you
were
dwelling
in
marble
halls
,
could
n't
you
?
And
*NL*
I
was
quite
sure
you
would
come
for
me
in
the
morning
,
if
you
did
n't
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
had
taken
the
scrawny
little
hand
awkwardly
in
his
;
then
and
*NL*
there
he
decided
what
to
do
.
He
could
not
tell
this
child
with
the
*NL*
glowing
eyes
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
;
he
would
take
her
home
and
*NL*
let
Marilla
do
that
.
She
could
n't
be
left
at
Bright
River
anyhow
,
no
*NL*
matter
what
mistake
had
been
made
,
so
all
questions
and
explanations
*NL*
might
as
well
be
deferred
until
he
was
safely
back
at
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
was
late
,
''
he
said
shyly
.
``
Come
along
.
The
horse
is
over
in
*NL*
the
yard
.
Give
me
your
bag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
carry
it
,
''
the
child
responded
cheerfully
.
``
It
is
n't
heavy
.
*NL*
I
've
got
all
my
worldly
goods
in
it
,
but
it
is
n't
heavy
.
And
if
it
is
n't
*NL*
carried
in
just
a
certain
way
the
handle
pulls
out
--
so
I
'd
better
*NL*
keep
it
because
I
know
the
exact
knack
of
it
.
It
's
an
extremely
old
*NL*
carpet-bag
.
Oh
,
I
'm
very
glad
you
've
come
,
even
if
it
would
have
been
*NL*
nice
to
sleep
in
a
wild
cherry-tree
.
We
've
got
to
drive
a
long
piece
,
*NL*
have
n't
we
?
Mrs.
Spencer
said
it
was
eight
miles
.
I
'm
glad
because
I
*NL*
love
driving
.
Oh
,
it
seems
so
wonderful
that
I
'm
going
to
live
with
you
*NL*
and
belong
to
you
.
I
've
never
belonged
to
anybody
--
not
really
.
But
the
*NL*
asylum
was
the
worst
.
I
've
only
been
in
it
four
months
,
but
that
was
*NL*
enough
.
I
do
n't
suppose
you
ever
were
an
orphan
in
an
asylum
,
so
you
*NL*
ca
n't
possibly
understand
what
it
is
like
.
It
's
worse
than
anything
you
*NL*
could
imagine
.
Mrs.
Spencer
said
it
was
wicked
of
me
to
talk
like
*NL*
that
,
but
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
wicked
.
It
's
so
easy
to
be
wicked
without
*NL*
knowing
it
,
is
n't
it
?
They
were
good
,
you
know
--
the
asylum
people
.
But
*NL*
there
is
so
little
scope
for
the
imagination
in
an
asylum
--
only
just
*NL*
in
the
other
orphans
.
It
was
pretty
interesting
to
imagine
things
about
*NL*
them
--
to
imagine
that
perhaps
the
girl
who
sat
next
to
you
was
really
*NL*
the
daughter
of
a
belted
earl
,
who
had
been
stolen
away
from
her
parents
*NL*
in
her
infancy
by
a
cruel
nurse
who
died
before
she
could
confess
.
I
*NL*
used
to
lie
awake
at
nights
and
imagine
things
like
that
,
because
*NL*
I
did
n't
have
time
in
the
day
.
I
guess
that
's
why
I
'm
so
thin
--
I
AM
*NL*
dreadful
thin
,
ai
n't
I
?
There
is
n't
a
pick
on
my
bones
.
I
do
love
to
*NL*
imagine
I
'm
nice
and
plump
,
with
dimples
in
my
elbows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
Matthew
's
companion
stopped
talking
,
partly
because
she
was
*NL*
out
of
breath
and
partly
because
they
had
reached
the
buggy
.
Not
another
*NL*
word
did
she
say
until
they
had
left
the
village
and
were
driving
down
*NL*
a
steep
little
hill
,
the
road
part
of
which
had
been
cut
so
deeply
into
*NL*
the
soft
soil
,
that
the
banks
,
fringed
with
blooming
wild
cherry-trees
*NL*
and
slim
white
birches
,
were
several
feet
above
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
put
out
her
hand
and
broke
off
a
branch
of
wild
plum
that
*NL*
brushed
against
the
side
of
the
buggy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
beautiful
?
What
did
that
tree
,
leaning
out
from
the
bank
,
*NL*
all
white
and
lacy
,
make
you
think
of
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
a
bride
,
of
course
--
a
bride
all
in
white
with
a
lovely
misty
veil
.
*NL*
I
've
never
seen
one
,
but
I
can
imagine
what
she
would
look
like
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
ever
expect
to
be
a
bride
myself
.
I
'm
so
homely
nobody
will
ever
want
to
*NL*
marry
me
--
unless
it
might
be
a
foreign
missionary
.
I
suppose
a
foreign
*NL*
missionary
might
n't
be
very
particular
.
But
I
do
hope
that
some
day
I
*NL*
shall
have
a
white
dress
.
That
is
my
highest
ideal
of
earthly
bliss
.
I
*NL*
just
love
pretty
clothes
.
And
I
've
never
had
a
pretty
dress
in
my
life
*NL*
that
I
can
remember
--
but
of
course
it
's
all
the
more
to
look
forward
*NL*
to
,
is
n't
it
?
And
then
I
can
imagine
that
I
'm
dressed
gorgeously
.
This
*NL*
morning
when
I
left
the
asylum
I
felt
so
ashamed
because
I
had
to
wear
*NL*
this
horrid
old
wincey
dress
.
All
the
orphans
had
to
wear
them
,
you
*NL*
know
.
A
merchant
in
Hopeton
last
winter
donated
three
hundred
yards
of
*NL*
wincey
to
the
asylum
.
Some
people
said
it
was
because
he
could
n't
sell
*NL*
it
,
but
I
'd
rather
believe
that
it
was
out
of
the
kindness
of
his
heart
,
*NL*
would
n't
you
?
When
we
got
on
the
train
I
felt
as
if
everybody
must
be
*NL*
looking
at
me
and
pitying
me
.
But
I
just
went
to
work
and
imagined
that
*NL*
I
had
on
the
most
beautiful
pale
blue
silk
dress
--
because
when
you
ARE
*NL*
imagining
you
might
as
well
imagine
something
worth
while
--
and
a
big
*NL*
hat
all
flowers
and
nodding
plumes
,
and
a
gold
watch
,
and
kid
gloves
and
*NL*
boots
.
I
felt
cheered
up
right
away
and
I
enjoyed
my
trip
to
the
Island
*NL*
with
all
my
might
.
I
was
n't
a
bit
sick
coming
over
in
the
boat
.
Neither
*NL*
was
Mrs.
Spencer
although
she
generally
is
.
She
said
she
had
n't
time
*NL*
to
get
sick
,
watching
to
see
that
I
did
n't
fall
overboard
.
She
said
she
*NL*
never
saw
the
beat
of
me
for
prowling
about
.
But
if
it
kept
her
from
*NL*
being
seasick
it
's
a
mercy
I
did
prowl
,
is
n't
it
?
And
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
everything
that
was
to
be
seen
on
that
boat
,
because
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
whether
I
'd
ever
have
another
opportunity
.
Oh
,
there
are
a
lot
more
*NL*
cherry-trees
all
in
bloom
!
This
Island
is
the
bloomiest
place
.
I
just
*NL*
love
it
already
,
and
I
'm
so
glad
I
'm
going
to
live
here
.
I
've
always
*NL*
heard
that
Prince
Edward
Island
was
the
prettiest
place
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
I
used
to
imagine
I
was
living
here
,
but
I
never
really
expected
I
*NL*
would
.
It
's
delightful
when
your
imaginations
come
true
,
is
n't
it
?
*NL*
But
those
red
roads
are
so
funny
.
When
we
got
into
the
train
at
*NL*
Charlottetown
and
the
red
roads
began
to
flash
past
I
asked
Mrs.
Spencer
*NL*
what
made
them
red
and
she
said
she
did
n't
know
and
for
pity
's
sake
not
*NL*
to
ask
her
any
more
questions
.
She
said
I
must
have
asked
her
a
thousand
*NL*
already
.
I
suppose
I
had
,
too
,
but
how
you
going
to
find
out
about
*NL*
things
if
you
do
n't
ask
questions
?
And
what
DOES
make
the
roads
red
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
one
of
the
things
to
find
out
sometime
.
Is
n't
it
splendid
*NL*
to
think
of
all
the
things
there
are
to
find
out
about
?
It
just
makes
*NL*
me
feel
glad
to
be
alive
--
it
's
such
an
interesting
world
.
It
would
n't
be
*NL*
half
so
interesting
if
we
know
all
about
everything
,
would
it
?
There
'd
*NL*
be
no
scope
for
imagination
then
,
would
there
?
But
am
I
talking
too
*NL*
much
?
People
are
always
telling
me
I
do
.
Would
you
rather
I
did
n't
*NL*
talk
?
If
you
say
so
I
'll
stop
.
I
can
STOP
when
I
make
up
my
mind
to
it
,
*NL*
although
it
's
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
,
much
to
his
own
surprise
,
was
enjoying
himself
.
Like
most
quiet
*NL*
folks
he
liked
talkative
people
when
they
were
willing
to
do
the
talking
*NL*
themselves
and
did
not
expect
him
to
keep
up
his
end
of
it
.
But
he
had
*NL*
never
expected
to
enjoy
the
society
of
a
little
girl
.
Women
were
bad
*NL*
enough
in
all
conscience
,
but
little
girls
were
worse
.
He
detested
the
*NL*
way
they
had
of
sidling
past
him
timidly
,
with
sidewise
glances
,
as
if
*NL*
they
expected
him
to
gobble
them
up
at
a
mouthful
if
they
ventured
to
*NL*
say
a
word
.
That
was
the
Avonlea
type
of
well-bred
little
girl
.
But
*NL*
this
freckled
witch
was
very
different
,
and
although
he
found
it
rather
*NL*
difficult
for
his
slower
intelligence
to
keep
up
with
her
brisk
mental
*NL*
processes
he
thought
that
he
``
kind
of
liked
her
chatter
.
''
So
he
said
as
*NL*
shyly
as
usual
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
can
talk
as
much
as
you
like
.
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
.
I
know
you
and
I
are
going
to
get
along
together
*NL*
fine
.
It
's
such
a
relief
to
talk
when
one
wants
to
and
not
be
told
*NL*
that
children
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
.
I
've
had
that
said
to
me
a
*NL*
million
times
if
I
have
once
.
And
people
laugh
at
me
because
I
use
big
*NL*
words
.
But
if
you
have
big
ideas
you
have
to
use
big
words
to
express
*NL*
them
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
that
seems
reasonable
,
''
said
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Spencer
said
that
my
tongue
must
be
hung
in
the
middle
.
But
it
*NL*
is
n't
--
it
's
firmly
fastened
at
one
end
.
Mrs.
Spencer
said
your
place
was
*NL*
named
Green
Gables
.
I
asked
her
all
about
it
.
And
she
said
there
were
*NL*
trees
all
around
it
.
I
was
gladder
than
ever
.
I
just
love
trees
.
And
*NL*
there
were
n't
any
at
all
about
the
asylum
,
only
a
few
poor
weeny-teeny
*NL*
things
out
in
front
with
little
whitewashed
cagey
things
about
them
.
*NL*
They
just
looked
like
orphans
themselves
,
those
trees
did
.
It
used
to
*NL*
make
me
want
to
cry
to
look
at
them

I
used
to
say
to
them
,
`
Oh
,
you
*NL*
POOR
little
things

If
you
were
out
in
a
great
big
woods
with
other

trees
all
around
you
and
little
mosses
and
Junebells
growing
over
your
*NL*
roots
and
a
brook
not
far
away
and
birds
singing
in
you
branches
,
you
*NL*
could
grow
,
could
n't
you
?
But
you
ca
n't
where
you
are

I
know
just
*NL*
exactly
how
you
feel
,
little
trees
.
'
I
felt
sorry
to
leave
them
behind
*NL*
this
morning
.
You
do
get
so
attached
to
things
like
that
,
do
n't
you
?
Is
*NL*
there
a
brook
anywhere
near
Green
Gables
?
I
forgot
to
ask
Mrs.
Spencer
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
yes
,
there
's
one
right
below
the
house

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fancy

It
's
always
been
one
of
my
dreams

live
near

never

I
would

Dreams

often
come
true

*NL*
Would
n't
it
be
nice
if
they
did

But
just
now
I
feel
pretty
nearly
*NL*
perfectly
happy

I
ca
n't
feel
exactly
perfectly
happy

well
,
*NL*
what
color
would
you
call
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
twitched
one
of
her
long
glossy
braids
over
her
thin
shoulder
and
*NL*
held
it
up
before
Matthew
's
eyes
.
Matthew
was
not
used
to
deciding
on
*NL*
the
tints
of
ladies
'
tresses
,
but
in
this
case
there
could
n't
be
much
*NL*
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
red

n't
it

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
let
the
braid
drop
back
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
come
from
*NL*
her
very
toes
and
to
exhale
forth
all
the
sorrows
of
the
ages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
red

she
said
resignedly
.
``
Now

why

n't
be
*NL*
perfectly
happy
.
Nobody
could
who
has
red
hair
.
I
do
n't
mind
the
other
*NL*
things
so
much
--
the
freckles
and
the
green
eyes
and
my
skinniness
.
I
*NL*
can
imagine
them
away
.
I
can
imagine
that
I
have
a
beautiful
rose-leaf
*NL*
complexion
and
lovely
starry
violet
eyes
.
But
I
CAN
NOT
imagine
that
red
*NL*
hair
away
.
I
do
my
best
.
I
think
to
myself
,
`
Now
my
hair
is
a
glorious
*NL*
black
,
black
as
the
raven
's
wing
.
'
But
all
the
time
I
KNOW
it
is
just
*NL*
plain
red
and
it
breaks
my
heart
.
It
will
be
my
lifelong
sorrow
.
I
read
*NL*
of
a
girl
once
in
a
novel
who
had
a
lifelong
sorrow
but
it
was
n't
red
*NL*
hair
.
Her
hair
was
pure
gold
rippling
back
from
her
alabaster
brow
.
What
*NL*
is
an
alabaster
brow
?
I
never
could
find
out
.
Can
you
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Matthew
,
who
was
getting
a
little
*NL*
dizzy
.
He
felt
as
he
had
once
felt
in
his
rash
youth
when
another
boy
*NL*
had
enticed
him
on
the
merry-go-round
at
a
picnic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whatever
it
was
it
must
have
been
something
nice
because
she
was
*NL*
divinely
beautiful
.
Have
you
ever
imagined
what
it
must
feel
like
to
be
*NL*
divinely
beautiful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
no
,
I
have
n't
,
''
confessed
Matthew
ingenuously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
often
.
Which
would
you
rather
be
if
you
had
the
*NL*
choice
--
divinely
beautiful
or
dazzlingly
clever
or
angelically
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
--
I
do
n't
know
exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I.
I
can
never
decide
.
But
it
does
n't
make
much
real
*NL*
difference
for
it
is
n't
likely
I
'll
ever
be
either
.
It
's
certain
I
'll
*NL*
never
be
angelically
good

Mrs.
Spencer
says
--
oh
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
!
Oh
,
Mr.
*NL*
Cuthbert
!!
Oh
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
!!!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
not
what
Mrs.
Spencer
had
said
;
neither
had
the
child
tumbled
*NL*
out
of
the
buggy
nor
had
Matthew
done
anything
astonishing
.
They
had
*NL*
simply
rounded
a
curve
in
the
road
and
found
themselves
in
the
``
Avenue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
Avenue
,
''
so
called
by
the
Newbridge
people
,
was
a
stretch
of
road
*NL*
four
or
five
hundred
yards
long
,
completely
arched
over
with
huge
,
*NL*
wide-spreading
apple-trees
,
planted
years
ago
by
an
eccentric
old
*NL*
farmer
.
Overhead
was
one
long
canopy
of
snowy
fragrant
bloom
.
Below
the
*NL*
boughs
the
air
was
full
of
a
purple
twilight
and
far
ahead
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
painted
sunset
sky
shone
like
a
great
rose
window
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
cathedral
aisle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
beauty
seemed
to
strike
the
child
dumb
.
She
leaned
back
in
the
*NL*
buggy
,
her
thin
hands
clasped
before
her
,
her
face
lifted
rapturously
to
*NL*
the
white
splendor
above
.
Even
when
they
had
passed
out
and
were
driving
*NL*
down
the
long
slope
to
Newbridge
she
never
moved
or
spoke
.
Still
with
*NL*
rapt
face
she
gazed
afar
into
the
sunset
west
,
with
eyes
that
saw
*NL*
visions
trooping
splendidly
across
that
glowing
background
.
Through
*NL*
Newbridge
,
a
bustling
little
village
where
dogs
barked
at
them
and
small
*NL*
boys
hooted
and
curious
faces
peered
from
the
windows
,
they
drove
,
still
*NL*
in
silence
.
When
three
more
miles
had
dropped
away
behind
them
the
child
*NL*
had
not
spoken
.
She
could
keep
silence
,
it
was
evident
,
as
energetically
*NL*
as
she
could
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
're
feeling
pretty
tired
and
hungry
,
''
Matthew
ventured
to
*NL*
say
at
last
,
accounting
for
her
long
visitation
of
dumbness
with
the
*NL*
only
reason
he
could
think
of
.
``
But
we
have
n't
very
far
to
go
now
--
only
*NL*
another
mile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
out
of
her
reverie
with
a
deep
sigh
and
looked
at
him
with
the
*NL*
dreamy
gaze
of
a
soul
that
had
been
wondering
afar
,
star-led
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
that
place
we
came
through
--
that
*NL*
white
place
--
what
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
you
must
mean
the
Avenue
,
''
said
Matthew
after
a
few
moments
'
*NL*
profound
reflection
.
``
It
is
a
kind
of
pretty
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
?
Oh
,
PRETTY
does
n't
seem
the
right
word
to
use
.
Nor
beautiful
,
*NL*
either
.
They
do
n't
go
far
enough
.
Oh
,
it
was
wonderful
--
wonderful
.
*NL*
It
's
the
first
thing
I
ever
saw
that
could
n't
be
improved
upon
by
*NL*
imagination
.
It
just
satisfies
me
here
''
--
she
put
one
hand
on
her
*NL*
breast
--
``
it
made
a
queer
funny
ache
and
yet
it
was
a
pleasant
ache
.
Did
*NL*
you
ever
have
an
ache
like
that
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
just
ca
n't
recollect
that
I
ever
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
it
lots
of
time
--
whenever
I
see
anything
royally
beautiful
.
But
*NL*
they
should
n't
call
that
lovely
place
the
Avenue
.
There
is
no
meaning
*NL*
in
a
name
like
that
.
They
should
call
it
--
let
me
see
--
the
White
Way
of
*NL*
Delight
.
Is
n't
that
a
nice
imaginative
name
?
When
I
do
n't
like
the
name
*NL*
of
a
place
or
a
person
I
always
imagine
a
new
one
and
always
think
of
*NL*
them
so
.
There
was
a
girl
at
the
asylum
whose
name
was
Hepzibah
Jenkins
,
*NL*
but
I
always
imagined
her
as
Rosalia
DeVere
.
Other
people
may
call
that
*NL*
place
the
Avenue
,
but
I
shall
always
call
it
the
White
Way
of
Delight
.
*NL*
Have
we
really
only
another
mile
to
go
before
we
get
home
?
I
'm
glad
and
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
.
I
'm
sorry
because
this
drive
has
been
so
pleasant
and
I
'm
*NL*
always
sorry
when
pleasant
things
end
.
Something
still
pleasanter
may
*NL*
come
after
,
but
you
can
never
be
sure
.
And
it
's
so
often
the
case
that
*NL*
it
is
n't
pleasanter
.
That
has
been
my
experience
anyhow
.
But
I
'm
glad
to
*NL*
think
of
getting
home
.
You
see
,
I
've
never
had
a
real
home
since
I
can
*NL*
remember
.
It
gives
me
that
pleasant
ache
again
just
to
think
of
coming
*NL*
to
a
really
truly
home
.
Oh
,
is
n't
that
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
driven
over
the
crest
of
a
hill
.
Below
them
was
a
pond
,
looking
*NL*
almost
like
a
river
so
long
and
winding
was
it
.
A
bridge
spanned
it
*NL*
midway
and
from
there
to
its
lower
end
,
where
an
amber-hued
belt
of
*NL*
sand-hills
shut
it
in
from
the
dark
blue
gulf
beyond
,
the
water
was
a
*NL*
glory
of
many
shifting
hues
--
the
most
spiritual
shadings
of
crocus
and
*NL*
rose
and
ethereal
green
,
with
other
elusive
tintings
for
which
no
name
*NL*
has
ever
been
found
.
Above
the
bridge
the
pond
ran
up
into
fringing
*NL*
groves
of
fir
and
maple
and
lay
all
darkly
translucent
in
their
wavering
*NL*
shadows
.
Here
and
there
a
wild
plum
leaned
out
from
the
bank
like
a
*NL*
white-clad
girl
tip-toeing
to
her
own
reflection
.
From
the
marsh
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
pond
came
the
clear
,
mournfully-sweet
chorus
of
the
frogs
.
*NL*
There
was
a
little
gray
house
peering
around
a
white
apple
orchard
on
*NL*
a
slope
beyond
and
,
although
it
was
not
yet
quite
dark
,
a
light
was
*NL*
shining
from
one
of
its
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Barry
's
pond
,
''
said
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
like
that
name
,
either
.
I
shall
call
it
--
let
me
see
--
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
.
Yes
,
that
is
the
right
name
for
it
.
I
know
*NL*
because
of
the
thrill
.
When
I
hit
on
a
name
that
suits
exactly
it
gives
*NL*
me
a
thrill
.
Do
things
ever
give
you
a
thrill
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
ruminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
yes
.
It
always
kind
of
gives
me
a
thrill
to
see
them
ugly
*NL*
white
grubs
that
spade
up
in
the
cucumber
beds
.
I
hate
the
look
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
that
can
be
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
thrill
.
Do
you
*NL*
think
it
can
?
There
does
n't
seem
to
be
much
connection
between
grubs
*NL*
and
lakes
of
shining
waters
,
does
there
?
But
why
do
other
people
call
it
*NL*
Barry
's
pond
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
because
Mr.
Barry
lives
up
there
in
that
house
.
Orchard
*NL*
Slope
's
the
name
of
his
place
.
If
it
was
n't
for
that
big
bush
behind
it
*NL*
you
could
see
Green
Gables
from
here
.
But
we
have
to
go
over
the
bridge
*NL*
and
round
by
the
road
,
so
it
's
near
half
a
mile
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Mr.
Barry
any
little
girls

Well
,
not
so
very
little
either

about
*NL*
my
size

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
one
about
eleven

Her
name
is
Diana

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
with
a
long
indrawing
of
breath
.
``
What
a
perfectly
lovely
name

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now

I
dunno

There
's
something
dreadful
heathenish
about

seems
to
me

I
'd
ruther
Jane
or
Mary
or
some
sensible
name
like
that

*NL*
But
when
Diana
was
born
there
was
a
schoolmaster
boarding
there
and
they
*NL*
gave
him
the
naming
of
her
and
he
called
her
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
there
had
been
a
schoolmaster
like
that
around
when
I
was
born

*NL*
then

Oh

here
we
are
at
the
bridge
.
I
'm
going
to
shut
my
eyes
tight
.
*NL*
I
'm
always
afraid
going
over
bridges
.
I
ca
n't
help
imagining
that
*NL*
perhaps
just
as
we
get
to
the
middle
,
they
'll
crumple
up
like
a

jack-knife
and
nip
us

So
I
shut

But
I
always
have
to
open
them
*NL*
for
all
when
I
think
we

getting
near

Because
,
you
see

DID
crumple
up
I
'd
want
to
SEE
it
crumple

What
a
jolly

rumble
it
makes
!
I
always
like
the
rumble
part
of
it

Is
n't
it
splendid
*NL*
there
are
so
many
things
to
like
in
this
world

There
we
're
over

Now
*NL*
I
'll
look
back

Good
night
,
dear
Lake
of
Shining
Waters

I
always
say
*NL*
good
night
to
the
things
I
love
,
just
as
I
would
to
people

I
think

smiling
at

*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
driven
up
the
further
hill
and
around
a
corner
Matthew
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
pretty
near
home
now

That
's
Green
Gables
over
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
tell
me

''
she
interrupted
breathlessly
,
catching
at
his
*NL*
partially
raised
arm
and
shutting
her
eyes
that
she
might
not
see
his
*NL*
gesture
.
``
Let
me
guess
.
I
'm
sure
I
'll
guess
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
about
her
.
They
were
on
the
crest
of
a
*NL*
hill
.
The
sun
had
set
some
time
since
,
but
the
landscape
was
still
*NL*
clear
in
the
mellow
afterlight
.
To
the
west
a
dark
church
spire
rose
*NL*
up
against
a
marigold
sky
.
Below
was
a
little
valley
and
beyond
a
long
,
*NL*
gently-rising
slope
with
snug
farmsteads
scattered
along
it
.
From
one
*NL*
to
another
the
child
's
eyes
darted
,
eager
and
wistful
.
At
last
they
*NL*
lingered
on
one
away
to
the
left
,
far
back
from
the
road
,
dimly
white
*NL*
with
blossoming
trees
in
the
twilight
of
the
surrounding
woods
.
Over
it
,
*NL*
in
the
stainless
southwest
sky
,
a
great
crystal-white
star
was
shining
*NL*
like
a
lamp
of
guidance
and
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
said
,
pointing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
slapped
the
reins
on
the
sorrel
's
back
delightedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
you
've
guessed
it
!
But
I
reckon
Mrs.
Spencer
described
it
*NL*
so
's
you
could
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

she
did
n't

really
she
did
n't

All
she
said
might
just
as
well
have
*NL*
been
about
most
of
those
other
places

I
had
n't
any
real
idea
what
it
*NL*
looked
like
.
But
just
as
soon
as
I
saw
it
I
felt
it
was
home
.
Oh
,
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
I
must
be
in
a
dream
.
Do
you
know
,
my
arm
must
be
black
and
*NL*
blue
from
the
elbow
up
,
for
I
've
pinched
myself
so
many
times
today
.
*NL*
Every
little
while
a
horrible
sickening
feeling
would
come
over
me
and
*NL*
I
'd
be
so
afraid
it
was
all
a
dream
.
Then
I
'd
pinch
myself
to
see
if
it
*NL*
was
real
--
until
suddenly
I
remembered
that
even
supposing
it
was
only
*NL*
a
dream
I
'd
better
go
on
dreaming
as
long
as
I
could
;
so
I
stopped
*NL*
pinching
.
But
it
IS
real
and
we
're
nearly
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
sigh
of
rapture
she
relapsed
into
silence
.
Matthew
stirred
*NL*
uneasily
.
He
felt
glad
that
it
would
be
Marilla
and
not
he
who
would
*NL*
have
to
tell
this
waif
of
the
world
that
the
home
she
longed
for
was
*NL*
not
to
be
hers
after
all
.
They
drove
over
Lynde
's
Hollow
,
where
it
was
*NL*
already
quite
dark
,
but
not
so
dark
that
Mrs.
Rachel
could
not
see
them
*NL*
from
her
window
vantage
,
and
up
the
hill
and
into
the
long
lane
of
Green
*NL*
Gables
.
By
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
house
Matthew
was
shrinking
from
*NL*
the
approaching
revelation
with
an
energy
he
did
not
understand
.
It
was
*NL*
not
of
Marilla
or
himself
he
was
thinking
of
the
trouble
this
mistake
*NL*
was
probably
going
to
make
for
them
,
but
of
the
child
's
disappointment
.
*NL*
When
he
thought
of
that
rapt
light
being
quenched
in
her
eyes
he
had
*NL*
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
going
to
assist
at
murdering
*NL*
something
--
much
the
same
feeling
that
came
over
him
when
he
had
to
kill
*NL*
a
lamb
or
calf
or
any
other
innocent
little
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yard
was
quite
dark
as
they
turned
into
it
and
the
poplar
leaves
*NL*
were
rustling
silkily
all
round
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
the
trees
talking
in
their
sleep
,
''
she
whispered
,
as
he
*NL*
lifted
her
to
the
ground
.
``
What
nice
dreams
they
must
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
holding
tightly
to
the
carpet-bag
which
contained
``
all
her
worldly
*NL*
goods
,
''
she
followed
him
into
the
house
.

CHAPTER
III
.
Marilla
Cuthbert
is
Surprised
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
came
briskly
forward
as
Matthew
opened
the
door
.
But
when
her
*NL*
eyes
fell
on
the
odd
little
figure
in
the
stiff
,
ugly
dress
,
with
the
*NL*
long
braids
of
red
hair
and
the
eager
,
luminous
eyes
,
she
stopped
short
*NL*
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
who
's
that
?
''
she
ejaculated
.
``
Where
is
the
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
n't
any
boy
,
''
said
Matthew
wretchedly
.
``
There
was
only
HER
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
at
the
child
,
remembering
that
he
had
never
even
asked
her
*NL*
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
boy
!
But
there
MUST
have
been
a
boy
,
''
insisted
Marilla
.
``
We
sent
*NL*
word
to
Mrs.
Spencer
to
bring
a
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
did
n't
.
She
brought
HER
.
I
asked
the
station-master
.
And
I
*NL*
had
to
bring
her
home
.
She
could
n't
be
left
there
,
no
matter
where
the
*NL*
mistake
had
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
a
pretty
piece
of
business
!
''
ejaculated
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
dialogue
the
child
had
remained
silent
,
her
eyes
roving
from
*NL*
one
to
the
other
,
all
the
animation
fading
out
of
her
face
.
Suddenly
*NL*
she
seemed
to
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
what
had
been
said
.
Dropping
her
*NL*
precious
carpet-bag
she
sprang
forward
a
step
and
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
me
!
''
she
cried
.
``
You
do
n't
want
me
because
I
'm
not
a
*NL*
boy
!
I
might
have
expected
it
.
Nobody
ever
did
want
me
.
I
might
have
*NL*
known
it
was
all
too
beautiful
to
last
.
I
might
have
known
nobody
really
*NL*
did
want
me
.
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
?
I
'm
going
to
burst
into
tears
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Burst
into
tears
she
did
.
Sitting
down
on
a
chair
by
the
table
,
flinging
*NL*
her
arms
out
upon
it
,
and
burying
her
face
in
them
,
she
proceeded
to
cry
*NL*
stormily
.
Marilla
and
Matthew
looked
at
each
other
deprecatingly
across
*NL*
the
stove
.
Neither
of
them
knew
what
to
say
or
do
.
Finally
Marilla
*NL*
stepped
lamely
into
the
breach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
there
's
no
need
to
cry
so
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
IS
need
!
''
The
child
raised
her
head
quickly
,
revealing
a
*NL*
tear-stained
face
and
trembling
lips
.
``
YOU
would
cry
,
too
,
if
you
were
*NL*
an
orphan
and
had
come
to
a
place
you
thought
was
going
to
be
home
and
*NL*
found
that
they
did
n't
want
you
because
you
were
n't
a
boy
.
Oh
,
this
is
*NL*
the
most
TRAGICAL
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
like
a
reluctant
smile
,
rather
rusty
from
long
disuse
,
*NL*
mellowed
Marilla
's
grim
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
n't
cry
any
more
.
We
're
not
going
to
turn
you
out-of-doors
*NL*
to-night
.
You
'll
have
to
stay
here
until
we
investigate
this
affair
.
*NL*
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
please
call
me
Cordelia
?
''
she
said
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
CALL
you
Cordelia
?
Is
that
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-o-o
,
it
's
not
exactly
my
name
,
but
I
would
love
to
be
called
*NL*
Cordelia
.
It
's
such
a
perfectly
elegant
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
on
earth
you
mean
.
If
Cordelia
is
n't
your
name
,
what
*NL*
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
''
reluctantly
faltered
forth
the
owner
of
that
name
,
``
but
,
*NL*
oh
,
please
do
call
me
Cordelia
.
It
ca
n't
matter
much
to
you
what
you
*NL*
call
me
if
I
'm
only
going
to
be
here
a
little
while
,
can
it
?
And
Anne
is
*NL*
such
an
unromantic
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unromantic
fiddlesticks
!
''
said
the
unsympathetic
Marilla
.
``
Anne
is
a
*NL*
real
good
plain
sensible
name
.
You
've
no
need
to
be
ashamed
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
ashamed
of
it
,
''
explained
Anne
,
``
only
I
like
Cordelia
*NL*
better
.
I
've
always
imagined
that
my
name
was
Cordelia
--
at
least
,
I
*NL*
always
have
of
late
years
.
When
I
was
young
I
used
to
imagine
it
was
*NL*
Geraldine
,
but
I
like
Cordelia
better
now
.
But
if
you
call
me
Anne
*NL*
please
call
me
Anne
spelled
with
an
E.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
difference
does
it
make
how
it
's
spelled
?
''
asked
Marilla
with
*NL*
another
rusty
smile
as
she
picked
up
the
teapot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
makes
SUCH
a
difference
.
It
LOOKS
so
much
nicer
.
When
you
hear
a
*NL*
name
pronounced
ca
n't
you
always
see
it
in
your
mind
,
just
as
if
it
was
*NL*
printed
out
?
I
can
;
and
A-n-n
looks
dreadful
,
but
A-n-n-e
looks
so
much
*NL*
more
distinguished
.
If
you
'll
only
call
me
Anne
spelled
with
an
E
I
*NL*
shall
try
to
reconcile
myself
to
not
being
called
Cordelia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
Anne
spelled
with
an
E
,
can
you
tell
us
how
this
*NL*
mistake
came
to
be
made
?
We
sent
word
to
Mrs.
Spencer
to
bring
us
a
boy
.
*NL*
Were
there
no
boys
at
the
asylum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
there
was
an
abundance
of
them
.
But
Mrs.
Spencer
said
*NL*
DISTINCTLY
that
you
wanted
a
girl
about
eleven
years
old
.
And
the
matron
*NL*
said
she
thought
I
would
do
.
You
do
n't
know
how
delighted
I
was
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
sleep
all
last
night
for
joy
.
Oh
,
''
she
added
reproachfully
,
*NL*
turning
to
Matthew
,
``
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
at
the
station
that
you
*NL*
did
n't
want
me
and
leave
me
there
?
If
I
had
n't
seen
the
White
Way
of
*NL*
Delight
and
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
it
would
n't
be
so
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
on
earth
does
she
mean
?
''
demanded
Marilla
,
staring
at
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
--
she
's
just
referring
to
some
conversation
we
had
on
the
road
,
''
*NL*
said
Matthew
hastily
.
``
I
'm
going
out
to
put
the
mare
in
,
Marilla
.
Have
*NL*
tea
ready
when
I
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
Mrs.
Spencer
bring
anybody
over
besides
you
?
''
continued
Marilla
*NL*
when
Matthew
had
gone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
brought
Lily
Jones
for
herself
.
Lily
is
only
five
years
old
and
she
*NL*
is
very
beautiful
and
had
nut-brown
hair
.
If
I
was
very
beautiful
and
*NL*
had
nut-brown
hair
would
you
keep
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
We
want
a
boy
to
help
Matthew
on
the
farm
.
A
girl
would
be
of
*NL*
no
use
to
us
.
Take
off
your
hat
.
I
'll
lay
it
and
your
bag
on
the
hall
*NL*
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
took
off
her
hat
meekly
.
Matthew
came
back
presently
and
they
sat
*NL*
down
to
supper
.
But
Anne
could
not
eat
.
In
vain
she
nibbled
at
the
*NL*
bread
and
butter
and
pecked
at
the
crab-apple
preserve
out
of
the
little
*NL*
scalloped
glass
dish
by
her
plate
.
She
did
not
really
make
any
headway
*NL*
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
eating
anything
,
''
said
Marilla
sharply
,
eying
her
as
if
it
*NL*
were
a
serious
shortcoming
.
Anne
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
.
I
'm
in
the
depths
of
despair
.
Can
you
eat
when
you
are
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
despair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
been
in
the
depths
of
despair
,
so
I
ca
n't
say
,
''
responded
*NL*
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
n't
you
?
Well
,
did
you
ever
try
to
IMAGINE
you
were
in
the
depths
*NL*
of
despair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
do
n't
think
you
can
understand
what
it
's
like
.
It
's
a
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
feeling
indeed
.
When
you
try
to
eat
a
lump
comes
right
*NL*
up
in
your
throat
and
you
ca
n't
swallow
anything
,
not
even
if
it
was
a
*NL*
chocolate
caramel
.
I
had
one
chocolate
caramel
once
two
years
ago
and
it
*NL*
was
simply
delicious
.
I
've
often
dreamed
since
then
that
I
had
a
lot
*NL*
of
chocolate
caramels
,
but
I
always
wake
up
just
when
I
'm
going
to
eat
*NL*
them
.
I
do
hope
you
wo
n't
be
offended
because
I
ca
n't
eat
.
Everything
is
*NL*
extremely
nice
,
but
still
I
can
not
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
she
's
tired
,
''
said
Matthew
,
who
had
n't
spoken
since
his
return
*NL*
from
the
barn
.
``
Best
put
her
to
bed
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
been
wondering
where
Anne
should
be
put
to
bed
.
She
had
*NL*
prepared
a
couch
in
the
kitchen
chamber
for
the
desired
and
expected
*NL*
boy
.
But
,
although
it
was
neat
and
clean
,
it
did
not
seem
quite
the
*NL*
thing
to
put
a
girl
there
somehow
.
But
the
spare
room
was
out
of
the
*NL*
question
for
such
a
stray
waif
,
so
there
remained
only
the
east
gable
*NL*
room
.
Marilla
lighted
a
candle
and
told
Anne
to
follow
her
,
which
Anne
*NL*
spiritlessly
did
,
taking
her
hat
and
carpet-bag
from
the
hall
table
as
*NL*
she
passed
.
The
hall
was
fearsomely
clean
;
the
little
gable
chamber
in
*NL*
which
she
presently
found
herself
seemed
still
cleaner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
set
the
candle
on
a
three-legged
,
three-cornered
table
and
*NL*
turned
down
the
bedclothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
a
nightgown
?
''
she
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
two
.
The
matron
of
the
asylum
made
them
for
me
.
They
're
*NL*
fearfully
skimpy
.
There
is
never
enough
to
go
around
in
an
asylum
,
so
*NL*
things
are
always
skimpy
--
at
least
in
a
poor
asylum
like
ours
.
I
hate
*NL*
skimpy
night-dresses
.
But
one
can
dream
just
as
well
in
them
as
*NL*
in
lovely
trailing
ones
,
with
frills
around
the
neck
,
that
's
one
*NL*
consolation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
undress
as
quick
as
you
can
and
go
to
bed
.
I
'll
come
back
in
a
*NL*
few
minutes
for
the
candle
.
I
dare
n't
trust
you
to
put
it
out
yourself
.
*NL*
You
'd
likely
set
the
place
on
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
had
gone
Anne
looked
around
her
wistfully
.
The
whitewashed
*NL*
walls
were
so
painfully
bare
and
staring
that
she
thought
they
must
ache
*NL*
over
their
own
bareness
.
The
floor
was
bare
,
too
,
except
for
a
round
*NL*
braided
mat
in
the
middle
such
as
Anne
had
never
seen
before
.
In
*NL*
one
corner
was
the
bed
,
a
high
,
old-fashioned
one
,
with
four
dark
,
*NL*
low-turned
posts
.
In
the
other
corner
was
the
aforesaid
three-corner
*NL*
table
adorned
with
a
fat
,
red
velvet
pin-cushion
hard
enough
to
turn
the
*NL*
point
of
the
most
adventurous
pin
.
Above
it
hung
a
little
six-by-eight
*NL*
mirror
.
Midway
between
table
and
bed
was
the
window
,
with
an
icy
white
*NL*
muslin
frill
over
it
,
and
opposite
it
was
the
wash-stand
.
The
whole
*NL*
apartment
was
of
a
rigidity
not
to
be
described
in
words
,
but
which
*NL*
sent
a
shiver
to
the
very
marrow
of
Anne
's
bones
.
With
a
sob
she
hastily
*NL*
discarded
her
garments
,
put
on
the
skimpy
nightgown
and
sprang
into
bed
*NL*
where
she
burrowed
face
downward
into
the
pillow
and
pulled
the
clothes
*NL*
over
her
head
.
When
Marilla
came
up
for
the
light
various
skimpy
*NL*
articles
of
raiment
scattered
most
untidily
over
the
floor
and
a
certain
*NL*
tempestuous
appearance
of
the
bed
were
the
only
indications
of
any
*NL*
presence
save
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
deliberately
picked
up
Anne
's
clothes
,
placed
them
neatly
on
a
prim
*NL*
yellow
chair
,
and
then
,
taking
up
the
candle
,
went
over
to
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
''
she
said
,
a
little
awkwardly
,
but
not
unkindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
white
face
and
big
eyes
appeared
over
the
bedclothes
with
a
*NL*
startling
suddenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
call
it
a
GOOD
night
when
you
know
it
must
be
the
very
*NL*
worst
night
I
've
ever
had
?
''
she
said
reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
dived
down
into
invisibility
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
went
slowly
down
to
the
kitchen
and
proceeded
to
wash
the
supper
*NL*
dishes
.
Matthew
was
smoking
--
a
sure
sign
of
perturbation
of
mind
.
He
*NL*
seldom
smoked
,
for
Marilla
set
her
face
against
it
as
a
filthy
habit
;
*NL*
but
at
certain
times
and
seasons
he
felt
driven
to
it
and
them
Marilla
*NL*
winked
at
the
practice
,
realizing
that
a
mere
man
must
have
some
vent
*NL*
for
his
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
a
pretty
kettle
of
fish
,
''
she
said
wrathfully
.
``
This
is
*NL*
what
comes
of
sending
word
instead
of
going
ourselves
.
Richard
Spencer
's
*NL*
folks
have
twisted
that
message
somehow
.
One
of
us
will
have
to
drive
*NL*
over
and
see
Mrs.
Spencer
tomorrow
,
that
's
certain
.
This
girl
will
have
*NL*
to
be
sent
back
to
the
asylum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Matthew
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
SUPPOSE
so
!
Do
n't
you
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
she
's
a
real
nice
little
thing
,
Marilla
.
It
's
kind
of
a
pity
*NL*
to
send
her
back
when
she
's
so
set
on
staying
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
think
we
ought

keep

her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
's
astonishment
could
not
have
been
greater
if
Matthew
had
*NL*
expressed
a
predilection
for
standing
on
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
no
,
I
suppose
not
--
not
exactly
,
''
stammered
Matthew
,
*NL*
uncomfortably
driven
into
a
corner
for
his
precise
meaning
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
--
we
could
hardly
be
expected
to
keep
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
not

What
good
would
she
be
to
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
be
some
good
to
her
,
''
said
Matthew
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
I
believe
that
child
has
bewitched
you
!
I
can
see
as
*NL*
plain
as
plain
that
you
want
to
keep
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
she
's
a
real
interesting
little
thing
,
''
persisted
Matthew
.
*NL*
``
You
should
have
heard
her
talk
coming
from
the
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
can
talk
fast
enough
.
I
saw
that
at
once
.
It
's
nothing
in
her
*NL*
favour
,
either
.
I
do
n't
like
children
who
have
so
much
to
say
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
an
orphan
girl
and
if
I
did
she
is
n't
the
style
I
'd
pick
out
.
*NL*
There
's
something
I
do
n't
understand
about
her
.
No
,
she
's
got
to
be
*NL*
despatched
straight-way
back
to
where
she
came
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
hire
a
French
boy
to
help
me
,
''
said
Matthew
,
``
and
she
'd
be
*NL*
company
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
suffering
for
company

said
Marilla
shortly
.
``
And
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now

it
's
just
as
you

of

Marilla

said
Matthew
*NL*
rising
and
putting
his
pipe
away
.
``
I
'm
going
to
bed

*NL*
*NL*
To
bed
went
Matthew
.
And
to
bed
,
when
she
had
put
her
dishes
away
,
went
*NL*
Marilla
,
frowning
most
resolutely
.
And
up-stairs
,
in
the
east
gable
,
a
*NL*
lonely
,
heart-hungry
,
friendless
child
cried
herself
to
sleep

CHAPTER
IV
.
Morning
at
Green
Gables
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
broad
daylight
when
Anne
awoke
and
sat
up
in
bed
,
staring
*NL*
confusedly
at
the
window
through
which
a
flood
of
cheery
sunshine
was
*NL*
pouring
and
outside
of
which
something
white
and
feathery
waved
across
*NL*
glimpses
of
blue
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
could
not
remember
where
she
was
.
First
came
a
*NL*
delightful
thrill
,
as
something
very
pleasant
;
then
a
horrible
*NL*
remembrance
.
This
was
Green
Gables
and
they
did
n't
want
her
because
she
*NL*
was
n't
a
boy
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
morning
and
,
yes
,
it
was
a
cherry-tree
in
full
bloom
outside
*NL*
of
her
window
.
With
a
bound
she
was
out
of
bed
and
across
the
floor
.
*NL*
She
pushed
up
the
sash
--
it
went
up
stiffly
and
creakily
,
as
if
it
had
n't
*NL*
been
opened
for
a
long
time
,
which
was
the
case
;
and
it
stuck
so
tight
*NL*
that
nothing
was
needed
to
hold
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
dropped
on
her
knees
and
gazed
out
into
the
June
morning
,
her
eyes
*NL*
glistening
with
delight
.
Oh
,
was
n't
it
beautiful
?
Was
n't
it
a
lovely
*NL*
place
?
Suppose
she
was
n't
really
going
to
stay
here
!
She
would
imagine
*NL*
she
was
.
There
was
scope
for
imagination
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
huge
cherry-tree
grew
outside
,
so
close
that
its
boughs
tapped
against
*NL*
the
house
,
and
it
was
so
thick-set
with
blossoms
that
hardly
a
leaf
*NL*
was
to
be
seen
.
On
both
sides
of
the
house
was
a
big
orchard
,
one
of
*NL*
apple-trees
and
one
of
cherry-trees
,
also
showered
over
with
blossoms
;
*NL*
and
their
grass
was
all
sprinkled
with
dandelions
.
In
the
garden
below
*NL*
were
lilac-trees
purple
with
flowers
,
and
their
dizzily
sweet
fragrance
*NL*
drifted
up
to
the
window
on
the
morning
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
the
garden
a
green
field
lush
with
clover
sloped
down
to
the
*NL*
hollow
where
the
brook
ran
and
where
scores
of
white
birches
grew
,
*NL*
upspringing
airily
out
of
an
undergrowth
suggestive
of
delightful
*NL*
possibilities
in
ferns
and
mosses
and
woodsy
things
generally
.
Beyond
it
*NL*
was
a
hill
,
green
and
feathery
with
spruce
and
fir
;
there
was
a
gap
in
*NL*
it
where
the
gray
gable
end
of
the
little
house
she
had
seen
from
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Off
to
the
left
were
the
big
barns
and
beyond
them
,
away
down
over
*NL*
green
,
low-sloping
fields
,
was
a
sparkling
blue
glimpse
of
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
beauty-loving
eyes
lingered
on
it
all
,
taking
everything
greedily
*NL*
in
.
She
had
looked
on
so
many
unlovely
places
in
her
life
,
poor
child
;
*NL*
but
this
was
as
lovely
as
anything
she
had
ever
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knelt
there
,
lost
to
everything
but
the
loveliness
around
her
,
until
*NL*
she
was
startled
by
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
.
Marilla
had
come
in
unheard
*NL*
by
the
small
dreamer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
you
were
dressed
,
''
she
said
curtly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
really
did
not
know
how
to
talk
to
the
child
,
and
her
*NL*
uncomfortable
ignorance
made
her
crisp
and
curt
when
she
did
not
mean
to
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
stood
up
and
drew
a
long
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
n't
it
wonderful
?
''
she
said
,
waving
her
hand
comprehensively
at
*NL*
the
good
world
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
big
tree
,
''
said
Marilla
,
``
and
it
blooms
great
,
but
the
fruit
*NL*
do
n't
amount
to
much
never
--
small
and
wormy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
just
the
tree
;
of
course
it
's
lovely
--
yes
,
it
's
*NL*
RADIANTLY
lovely
--
it
blooms
as
if
it
meant
it
--
but
I
meant
everything
,
*NL*
the
garden
and
the
orchard
and
the
brook
and
the
woods
,
the
whole
big
*NL*
dear
world
.
Do
n't
you
feel
as
if
you
just
loved
the
world
on
a
morning
*NL*
like
this
?
And
I
can
hear
the
brook
laughing
all
the
way
up
here
.
*NL*
Have
you
ever
noticed
what
cheerful
things
brooks
are
?
They
're
always
*NL*
laughing
.
Even
in
winter-time
I
've
heard
them
under
the
ice
.
I
'm
so
glad
*NL*
there
's
a
brook
near
Green
Gables
.
Perhaps
you
think
it
does
n't
make
any
*NL*
difference
to
me
when
you
're
not
going
to
keep
me
,
but
it
does
.
I
shall
*NL*
always
like
to
remember
that
there
is
a
brook
at
Green
Gables
even
if
*NL*
I
never
see
it
again
.
If
there
was
n't
a
brook
I
'd
be
HAUNTED
by
the
*NL*
uncomfortable
feeling
that
there
ought
to
be
one
.
I
'm
not
in
the
depths
*NL*
of
despair
this
morning
.
I
never
can
be
in
the
morning
.
Is
n't
it
a
*NL*
splendid
thing
that
there
are
mornings
?
But
I
feel
very
sad
.
I
've
just
*NL*
been
imagining
that
it
was
really
me
you
wanted
after
all
and
that
I
was
*NL*
to
stay
here
for
ever
and
ever
.
It
was
a
great
comfort
while
it
lasted
.
*NL*
But
the
worst
of
imagining
things
is
that
the
time
comes
when
you
have
*NL*
to
stop
and
that
hurts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
get
dressed
and
come
down-stairs
and
never
mind
your
*NL*
imaginings
,
''
said
Marilla
as
soon
as
she
could
get
a
word
in
edgewise
.
*NL*
``
Breakfast
is
waiting
.
Wash
your
face
and
comb
your
hair
.
Leave
the
*NL*
window
up
and
turn
your
bedclothes
back
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
Be
as
*NL*
smart
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
could
evidently
be
smart
to
some
purpose
for
she
was
down-stairs
*NL*
in
ten
minutes
'
time
,
with
her
clothes
neatly
on
,
her
hair
brushed
and
*NL*
braided
,
her
face
washed
,
and
a
comfortable
consciousness
pervading
her
*NL*
soul
that
she
had
fulfilled
all
Marilla
's
requirements
.
As
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
however
,
she
had
forgotten
to
turn
back
the
bedclothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
pretty
hungry
this
morning
,
''
she
announced
as
she
slipped
into
the
*NL*
chair
Marilla
placed
for
her
.
``
The
world
does
n't
seem
such
a
howling
*NL*
wilderness
as
it
did
last
night
.
I
'm
so
glad
it
's
a
sunshiny
morning
.
*NL*
But
I
like
rainy
mornings
real
well
,
too
.
All
sorts
of
mornings
are
*NL*
interesting
,
do
n't
you
think
?
You
do
n't
know
what
's
going
to
happen
*NL*
through
the
day
,
and
there
's
so
much
scope
for
imagination
.
But
I
'm
*NL*
glad
it
's
not
rainy
today
because
it
's
easier
to
be
cheerful
and
bear
*NL*
up
under
affliction
on
a
sunshiny
day
.
I
feel
that
I
have
a
good
deal
*NL*
to
bear
up
under
.
It
's
all
very
well
to
read
about
sorrows
and
imagine
*NL*
yourself
living
through
them
heroically
,
but
it
's
not
so
nice
when
you
*NL*
really
come
to
have
them
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
pity
's
sake
hold
your
tongue
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
You
talk
entirely
too
*NL*
much
for
a
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
Anne
held
her
tongue
so
obediently
and
thoroughly
that
her
*NL*
continued
silence
made
Marilla
rather
nervous
,
as
if
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
something
not
exactly
natural
.
Matthew
also
held
his
tongue
,
--
but
this
*NL*
was
natural
,
--
so
that
the
meal
was
a
very
silent
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
progressed
Anne
became
more
and
more
abstracted
,
eating
*NL*
mechanically
,
with
her
big
eyes
fixed
unswervingly
and
unseeingly
on
the
*NL*
sky
outside
the
window
.
This
made
Marilla
more
nervous
than
ever
;
she
*NL*
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
while
this
odd
child
's
body
might
*NL*
be
there
at
the
table
her
spirit
was
far
away
in
some
remote
airy
*NL*
cloudland
,
borne
aloft
on
the
wings
of
imagination
.
Who
would
want
such
*NL*
a
child
about
the
place
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Matthew
wished
to
keep
her
,
of
all
unaccountable
things
!
Marilla
*NL*
felt
that
he
wanted
it
just
as
much
this
morning
as
he
had
the
night
*NL*
before
,
and
that
he
would
go
on
wanting
it
.
That
was
Matthew
's
way
--
take
*NL*
a
whim
into
his
head
and
cling
to
it
with
the
most
amazing
silent
*NL*
persistency
--
a
persistency
ten
times
more
potent
and
effectual
in
its
*NL*
very
silence
than
if
he
had
talked
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
meal
was
ended
Anne
came
out
of
her
reverie
and
offered
to
wash
*NL*
the
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
wash
dishes
right
?
''
asked
Marilla
distrustfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
.
I
'm
better
at
looking
after
children
,
though
.
I
've
had
so
*NL*
much
experience
at
that
.
It
's
such
a
pity
you
have
n't
any
here
for
me
to
*NL*
look
after
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
as
if
I
wanted
any
more
children
to
look
after
than
I
've
*NL*
got
at
present
.
YOU
'RE
problem
enough
in
all
conscience
.
What
's
to
be
*NL*
done
with
you
I
do
n't
know
.
Matthew
is
a
most
ridiculous
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
lovely
,
''
said
Anne
reproachfully
.
``
He
is
so
very
*NL*
sympathetic
.
He
did
n't
mind
how
much
I
talked
--
he
seemed
to
like
it
.
I
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
a
kindred
spirit
as
soon

ever
I
saw
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
both
queer
enough
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
by
kindred
spirits
,
''
*NL*
said
Marilla
with
a
sniff
.
``
Yes
,
you
may
wash
the
dishes
.
Take
plenty
of
*NL*
hot
water
,
and
be
sure
you
dry
them
well
.
I
've
got
enough
to
attend
to
*NL*
this
morning
for
I
'll
have
to
drive
over
to
White
Sands
in
the
afternoon
*NL*
and
see
Mrs.
Spencer
.
You
'll
come
with
me
and
we
'll
settle
what
's
to
be
*NL*
done
with
you
.
After
you
've
finished
the
dishes
go
up-stairs
and
make
*NL*
your
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
washed
the
dishes
deftly
enough
,
as
Marilla
who
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
*NL*
the
process
,
discerned
.
Later
on
she
made
her
bed
less
successfully
,
for
*NL*
she
had
never
learned
the
art
of
wrestling
with
a
feather
tick
.
But
is
*NL*
was
done
somehow
and
smoothed
down
;
and
then
Marilla
,
to
get
rid
of
her
,
*NL*
told
her
she
might
go
out-of-doors
and
amuse
herself
until
dinner
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
flew
to
the
door
,
face
alight
,
eyes
glowing
.
On
the
very
threshold
*NL*
she
stopped
short
,
wheeled
about
,
came
back
and
sat
down
by
the
table
,
*NL*
light
and
glow
as
effectually
blotted
out
as
if
some
one
had
clapped
an
*NL*
extinguisher
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
now
?
''
demanded
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
dare
go
out
,
''
said
Anne
,
in
the
tone
of
a
martyr
relinquishing
*NL*
all
earthly
joys
.
``
If
I
ca
n't
stay
here
there
is
no
use
in
my
loving
*NL*
Green
Gables
.
And
if
I
go
out
there
and
get
acquainted
with
all
those
*NL*
trees
and
flowers
and
the
orchard
and
the
brook
I
'll
not
be
able
to
help
*NL*
loving
it
.
It
's
hard
enough
now
,
so
I
wo
n't
make
it
any
harder
.
I
want
*NL*
to
go
out
so
much
--
everything
seems
to
be
calling
to
me
,
`
Anne
,
Anne
,
*NL*
come
out
to
us
.
Anne
,
Anne
,
we
want
a
playmate
'
--
but
it
's
better
not
.
*NL*
There
is
no
use
in
loving
things
if
you
have
to
be
torn
from
them
,
is
*NL*
there
?
And
it
's
so
hard
to
keep
from
loving
things
,
is
n't
it
?
That
was
*NL*
why
I
was
so
glad
when
I
thought
I
was
going
to
live
here
.
I
thought
*NL*
I
'd
have
so
many
things
to
love
and
nothing
to
hinder
me
.
But
that
brief
*NL*
dream
is
over
.
I
am
resigned
to
my
fate
now
,
so
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
*NL*
go
out
for
fear
I
'll
get
unresigned
again
.
What
is
the
name
of
that
*NL*
geranium
on
the
window-sill
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
apple-scented
geranium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
sort
of
a
name
.
I
mean
just
a
name
you
gave
it
*NL*
yourself
.
Did
n't
you
give
it
a
name
?
May
I
give
it
one
then
?
May
I
call
*NL*
it
--
let
me
see
--
Bonny
would
do
--
may
I
call
it
Bonny
while
I
'm
here
?
Oh
,
*NL*
do
let
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
I
do
n't
care
.
But
where
on
earth
is
the
sense
of
naming
a
*NL*
geranium
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
like
things
to
have
handles
even
if
they
are
only
geraniums
.
It
*NL*
makes
them
seem
more
like
people
.
How
do
you
know
but
that
it
hurts
a
*NL*
geranium
's
feelings
just
to
be
called
a
geranium
and
nothing
else
?
You
*NL*
would
n't
like
to
be
called
nothing
but
a
woman
all
the
time
.
Yes
,
I
*NL*
shall
call
it
Bonny
.
I
named
that
cherry-tree
outside
my
bedroom
window
*NL*
this
morning
.
I
called
it
Snow
Queen
because
it
was
so
white
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
it
wo
n't
always
be
in
blossom
,
but
one
can
imagine
that
it
is
,
ca
n't
*NL*
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
in
all
my
life
saw
or
heard
anything
to
equal
her
,
''
muttered
*NL*
Marilla
,
beating
a
retreat
down
to
the
cellar
after
potatoes
.
``
She
*NL*
is
kind
of
interesting
as
Matthew
says
.
I
can
feel
already
that
I
'm
*NL*
wondering
what
on
earth
she
'll
say
next
.
She
'll
be
casting
a
spell
over
*NL*
me
,
too
.
She
's
cast
it
over
Matthew
.
That
look
he
gave
me
when
he
went
*NL*
out
said
everything
he
said
or
hinted
last
night
over
again
.
I
wish
he
*NL*
was
like
other
men
and
would
talk
things
out
.
A
body
could
answer
back
*NL*
then
and
argue
him
into
reason
.
But
what
's
to
be
done
with
a
man
who
*NL*
just
LOOKS
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
relapsed
into
reverie
,
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
her
eyes
*NL*
on
the
sky
,
when
Marilla
returned
from
her
cellar
pilgrimage
.
There
*NL*
Marilla
left
her
until
the
early
dinner
was
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
can
have
the
mare
and
buggy
this
afternoon
,
Matthew
?
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
nodded
and
looked
wistfully
at
Anne
.
Marilla
intercepted
the
*NL*
look
and
said
grimly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
drive
over
to
White
Sands
and
settle
this
thing
.
I
'll
take
*NL*
Anne
with
me
and
Mrs.
Spencer
will
probably
make
arrangements
to
send
*NL*
her
back
to
Nova
Scotia
at
once
.
I
'll
set
your
tea
out
for
you
and
I
'll
*NL*
be
home
in
time
to
milk
the
cows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Matthew
said
nothing
and
Marilla
had
a
sense
of
having
wasted
*NL*
words
and
breath
.
There
is
nothing
more
aggravating
than
a
man
who
wo
n't
*NL*
talk
back
--
unless
it
is
a
woman
who
wo
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
hitched
the
sorrel
into
the
buggy
in
due
time
and
Marilla
and
*NL*
Anne
set
off
.
Matthew
opened
the
yard
gate
for
them
and
as
they
drove
*NL*
slowly
through
,
he
said
,
to
nobody
in
particular
as
it
seemed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Jerry
Buote
from
the
Creek
was
here
this
morning
,
and
I
told
him
*NL*
I
guessed
I
'd
hire
him
for
the
summer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
made
no
reply
,
but
she
hit
the
unlucky
sorrel
such
a
vicious
*NL*
clip
with
the
whip
that
the
fat
mare
,
unused
to
such
treatment
,
whizzed
*NL*
indignantly
down
the
lane
at
an
alarming
pace
.
Marilla
looked
back
once
*NL*
as
the
buggy
bounced
along
and
saw
that
aggravating
Matthew
leaning
over
*NL*
the
gate
,
looking
wistfully
after
them
.

CHAPTER
V.
Anne
's
History
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
said
Anne
confidentially
,
``
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
enjoy
*NL*
this
drive
.
It
's
been
my
experience
that
you
can
nearly
always
enjoy
*NL*
things
if
you
make
up
your
mind
firmly
that
you
will
.
Of
course
,
you
*NL*
must
make
it
up
FIRMLY
.
I
am
not
going
to
think
about
going
back
to
the
*NL*
asylum
while
we
're
having
our
drive
.
I
'm
just
going
to
think
about
*NL*
the
drive
.
Oh
,
look
,
there
's
one
little
early
wild
rose
out
!
Is
n't
it
*NL*
lovely
?
Do
n't
you
think
it
must
be
glad
to
be
a
rose
?
Would
n't
it
*NL*
be
nice
if
roses
could
talk
?
I
'm
sure
they
could
tell
us
such
lovely
*NL*
things
.
And
is
n't
pink
the
most
bewitching
color
in
the
world
?
I
love
*NL*
it
,
but
I
ca
n't
wear
it
.
Redheaded
people
ca
n't
wear
pink
,
not
even
in
*NL*
imagination
.
Did
you
ever
know
of
anybody
whose
hair
was
red
when
she
*NL*
was
young
,
but
got
to
be
another
color
when
she
grew
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
know
as
I
ever
did
,
''
said
Marilla
mercilessly
,
``
and
I
*NL*
should
n't
think
it
likely
to
happen
in
your
case
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
is
another
hope
gone
.
`
My
life
is
a
perfect
graveyard
of
*NL*
buried
hopes
.
'
That
's
a
sentence
I
read
in
a
book
once
,
and
I
say
it
*NL*
over
to
comfort
myself
whenever
I
'm
disappointed
in
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
where
the
comforting
comes
in
myself
,
''
said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
because
it
sounds
so
nice
and
romantic
,
just
as
if
I
were
a
*NL*
heroine
in
a
book
,
you
know
.
I
am
so
fond
of
romantic
things
,
and
a
*NL*
graveyard
full
of
buried
hopes
is
about
as
romantic
a
thing
as
one
can
*NL*
imagine
is
n't
it
?
I
'm
rather
glad
I
have
one
.
Are
we
going
across
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
going
over
Barry
's
pond
,
if
that
's
what
you
mean
by
your
Lake
*NL*
of
Shining
Waters
.
We
're
going
by
the
shore
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shore
road
sounds
nice
,
''
said
Anne
dreamily
.
``
Is
it
as
nice
as
it
*NL*
sounds
?
Just
when
you
said
`
shore
road
'
I
saw
it
in
a
picture
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
as
quick
as
that
!
And
White
Sands
is
a
pretty
name
,
too
;
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
it
as
well
as
Avonlea
.
Avonlea
is
a
lovely
name
.
It
just
*NL*
sounds
like
music
.
How
far
is
it
to
White
Sands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
five
miles
;
and
as
you
're
evidently
bent
on
talking
you
might
as
*NL*
well
talk
to
some
purpose
by
telling
me
what
you
know
about
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
I
KNOW
about
myself
is
n't
really
worth
telling
,
''
said
Anne
*NL*
eagerly
.
``
If
you
'll
only
let
me
tell
you
what
I
IMAGINE
about
myself
*NL*
you
'll
think
it
ever
so
much
more
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
want
any
of
your
imaginings
.
Just
you
stick
to
bald
facts
.
*NL*
Begin
at
the
beginning
.
Where
were
you
born
and
how
old
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
eleven
last
March
,
''
said
Anne
,
resigning
herself
to
bald
facts
*NL*
with
a
little
sigh
.
``
And
I
was
born
in
Bolingbroke
,
Nova
Scotia
.
*NL*
My
father
's
name
was
Walter
Shirley
,
and
he
was
a
teacher
in
the
*NL*
Bolingbroke
High
School
.
My
mother
's
name
was
Bertha
Shirley
.
Are
n't
*NL*
Walter
and
Bertha
lovely
names
?
I
'm
so
glad
my
parents
had
nice
names
.
*NL*
It
would
be
a
real
disgrace
to
have
a
father
named
--
well
,
say
Jedediah
,
*NL*
would
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
it
does
n't
matter
what
a
person
's
name
is
as
long
as
he
behaves
*NL*
himself
,
''
said
Marilla
,
feeling
herself
called
upon
to
inculcate
a
good
*NL*
and
useful
moral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
Anne
looked
thoughtful
.
``
I
read
in
a
book
once
*NL*
that
a
rose
by
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
,
but
I
've
never
been
*NL*
able
to
believe
it
.
I
do
n't
believe
a
rose
WOULD
be
as
nice
if
it
was
*NL*
called
a
thistle
or
a
skunk
cabbage
.
I
suppose
my
father
could
have
been
*NL*
a
good
man
even
if
he
had
been
called
Jedediah
;
but
I
'm
sure
it
would
*NL*
have
been
a
cross
.
Well
,
my
mother
was
a
teacher
in
the
High
school
,
*NL*
too
,
but
when
she
married
father
she
gave
up
teaching
,
of
course
.
A
*NL*
husband
was
enough
responsibility
.
Mrs.
Thomas
said
that
they
were
*NL*
a
pair
of
babies
and
as
poor
as
church
mice
.
They
went
to
live
in
a
*NL*
weeny-teeny
little
yellow
house
in
Bolingbroke
.
I
've
never
seen
that
*NL*
house
,
but
I
've
imagined
it
thousands
of
times
.
I
think
it
must
have
*NL*
had
honeysuckle
over
the
parlor
window
and
lilacs
in
the
front
yard
and
*NL*
lilies
of
the
valley
just
inside
the
gate
.
Yes
,
and
muslin
curtains
in
*NL*
all
the
windows
.
Muslin
curtains
give
a
house
such
an
air
.
I
was
born
*NL*
in
that
house
.
Mrs.
Thomas
said
I
was
the
homeliest
baby
she
ever
saw
,
I
*NL*
was
so
scrawny
and
tiny
and
nothing
but
eyes
,
but
that
mother
thought
I
*NL*
was
perfectly
beautiful
.
I
should
think
a
mother
would
be
a
better
judge
*NL*
than
a
poor
woman
who
came
in
to
scrub
,
would
n't
you
?
I
'm
glad
she
*NL*
was
satisfied
with
me
anyhow
,
I
would
feel
so
sad
if
I
thought
I
was
a
*NL*
disappointment
to
her
--
because
she
did
n't
live
very
long
after
that
,
you
*NL*
see
.
She
died
of
fever
when
I
was
just
three
months
old
.
I
do
wish
she
'd
*NL*
lived
long
enough
for
me
to
remember
calling
her
mother
.
I
think
it
*NL*
would
be
so
sweet
to
say
`
mother
,
'
do
n't
you
?
And
father
died
four
days
*NL*
afterwards
from
fever
too
.
That
left
me
an
orphan
and
folks
were
at
*NL*
their
wits
'
end
,
so
Mrs.
Thomas
said
,
what
to
do
with
me
.
You
see
,
*NL*
nobody
wanted
me
even
then
.
It
seems
to
be
my
fate
.
Father
and
mother
*NL*
had
both
come
from
places
far
away
and
it
was
well
known
they
had
n't
any
*NL*
relatives
living
.
Finally
Mrs.
Thomas
said
she
'd
take
me
,
though
she
was
*NL*
poor
and
had
a
drunken
husband
.
She
brought
me
up
by
hand
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
if
there
is
anything
in
being
brought
up
by
hand
that
ought
to
make
*NL*
people
who
are
brought
up
that
way
better
than
other
people
?
Because
*NL*
whenever
I
was
naughty
Mrs.
Thomas
would
ask
me
how
I
could
be
such
a
*NL*
bad
girl
when
she
had
brought
me
up
by
hand
--
reproachful-like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Thomas
moved
away
from
Bolingbroke
to
Marysville
,
and
I
*NL*
lived
with
them
until
I
was
eight
years
old
.
I
helped
look
after
the
*NL*
Thomas
children
--
there
were
four
of
them
younger
than
me
--
and
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
they
took
a
lot
of
looking
after
.
Then
Mr.
Thomas
was
killed
*NL*
falling
under
a
train
and
his
mother
offered
to
take
Mrs.
Thomas
and
the
*NL*
children
,
but
she
did
n't
want
me
.
Mrs.
Thomas
was
at
HER
wits
'
end
,
so
*NL*
she
said
,
what
to
do
with
me
.
Then
Mrs.
Hammond
from
up
the
river
came
*NL*
down
and
said
she
'd
take
me
,
seeing
I
was
handy
with
children
,
and
*NL*
I
went
up
the
river
to
live
with
her
in
a
little
clearing
among
the
*NL*
stumps
.
It
was
a
very
lonesome
place
.
I
'm
sure
I
could
never
have
*NL*
lived
there
if
I
had
n't
had
an
imagination
.
Mr.
Hammond
worked
a
little
*NL*
sawmill
up
there
,
and
Mrs.
Hammond
had
eight
children
.
She
had
twins
*NL*
three
times
.
I
like
babies
in
moderation
,
but
twins
three
times
in
*NL*
succession
is
TOO
MUCH
.
I
told
Mrs.
Hammond
so
firmly
,
when
the
last
*NL*
pair
came
.
I
used
to
get
so
dreadfully
tired
carrying
them
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lived
up
river
with
Mrs.
Hammond
over
two
years
,
and
then
Mr.
Hammond
*NL*
died
and
Mrs.
Hammond
broke
up
housekeeping
.
She
divided
her
children
*NL*
among
her
relatives
and
went
to
the
States
.
I
had
to
go
to
the
asylum
*NL*
at
Hopeton
,
because
nobody
would
take
me
.
They
did
n't
want
me
at
the
*NL*
asylum
,
either
;
they
said
they
were
over-crowded
as
it
was
.
But
they
had
*NL*
to
take
me
and
I
was
there
four
months
until
Mrs.
Spencer
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
finished
up
with
another
sigh
,
of
relief
this
time
.
Evidently
*NL*
she
did
not
like
talking
about
her
experiences
in
a
world
that
had
not
*NL*
wanted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
go
to
school
?
''
demanded
Marilla
,
turning
the
sorrel
mare
*NL*
down
the
shore
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
great
deal
.
I
went
a
little
the
last
year
I
stayed
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Thomas
.
When
I
went
up
river
we
were
so
far
from
a
school
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
walk
it
in
winter
and
there
was
a
vacation
in
summer
,
so
I
*NL*
could
only
go
in
the
spring
and
fall
.
But
of
course
I
went
while
I
was
*NL*
at
the
asylum
.
I
can
read
pretty
well
and
I
know
ever
so
many
pieces
of
*NL*
poetry
off
by
heart
--
`
The
Battle
of
Hohenlinden
'
and
`
Edinburgh
after
*NL*
Flodden
,
'
and
`
Bingen
of
the
Rhine
,
'
and
most
of
the
`
Lady
of
the
Lake
'
*NL*
and
most
of
`
The
Seasons
'
by
James
Thompson
.
Do
n't
you
just
love
poetry
*NL*
that
gives
you
a
crinkly
feeling
up
and
down
your
back
?
There
is
a
piece
*NL*
in
the
Fifth
Reader
--
`
The
Downfall
of
Poland
'
--
that
is
just
full
of
*NL*
thrills
.
Of
course
,
I
was
n't
in
the
Fifth
Reader
--
I
was
only
in
the
*NL*
Fourth
--
but
the
big
girls
used
to
lend
me
theirs
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
those
women
--
Mrs.
Thomas
and
Mrs.
Hammond
--
good
to
you
?
''
asked
*NL*
Marilla
,
looking
at
Anne
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O-o-o-h
,
''
faltered
Anne
.
Her
sensitive
little
face
suddenly
flushed
*NL*
scarlet
and
embarrassment
sat
on
her
brow
.
``
Oh
,
they
MEANT
to
be
--
I
know
*NL*
they
meant
to
be
just
as
good
and
kind
as
possible
.
And
when
people
*NL*
mean
to
be
good
to
you
,
you
do
n't
mind
very
much
when
they
're
not
*NL*
quite
--
always
.
They
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
them
,
you
know
.
It
's
a
very
*NL*
trying
to
have
a
drunken
husband
,
you
see
;
and
it
must
be
very
trying
to
*NL*
have
twins
three
times
in
succession
,
do
n't
you
think
?
But
I
feel
sure
*NL*
they
meant
to
be
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
asked
no
more
questions
.
Anne
gave
herself
up
to
a
silent
*NL*
rapture
over
the
shore
road
and
Marilla
guided
the
sorrel
abstractedly
*NL*
while
she
pondered
deeply
.
Pity
was
suddenly
stirring
in
her
heart
for
*NL*
the
child
.
What
a
starved
,
unloved
life
she
had
had
--
a
life
of
drudgery
*NL*
and
poverty
and
neglect
;
for
Marilla
was
shrewd
enough
to
read
between
*NL*
the
lines
of
Anne
's
history
and
divine
the
truth
.
No
wonder
she
had
been
*NL*
so
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
a
real
home
.
It
was
a
pity
she
had
to
be
*NL*
sent
back
.
What
if
she
,
Marilla
,
should
indulge
Matthew
's
unaccountable
*NL*
whim
and
let
her
stay
?
He
was
set
on
it
;
and
the
child
seemed
a
nice
,
*NL*
teachable
little
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
too
much
to
say
,
''
thought
Marilla
,
``
but
she
might
be
trained
*NL*
out
of
that
.
And
there
's
nothing
rude
or
slangy
in
what
she
does
say
.
*NL*
She
's
ladylike
.
It
's
likely
her
people
were
nice
folks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shore
road
was
``
woodsy
and
wild
and
lonesome
.
''
On
the
right
hand
,
*NL*
scrub
firs
,
their
spirits
quite
unbroken
by
long
years
of
tussle
with
*NL*
the
gulf
winds
,
grew
thickly
.
On
the
left
were
the
steep
red
sandstone
*NL*
cliffs
,
so
near
the
track
in
places
that
a
mare
of
less
steadiness
than
*NL*
the
sorrel
might
have
tried
the
nerves
of
the
people
behind
her
.
Down
*NL*
at
the
base
of
the
cliffs
were
heaps
of
surf-worn
rocks
or
little
sandy
*NL*
coves
inlaid
with
pebbles
as
with
ocean
jewels
;
beyond
lay
the
sea
,
*NL*
shimmering
and
blue
,
and
over
it
soared
the
gulls
,
their
pinions
*NL*
flashing
silvery
in
the
sunlight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
the
sea
wonderful
?
''
said
Anne
,
rousing
from
a
long
,
wide-eyed
*NL*
silence
.
``
Once
,
when
I
lived
in
Marysville
,
Mr.
Thomas
hired
an
express
*NL*
wagon
and
took
us
all
to
spend
the
day
at
the
shore
ten
miles
away
.
*NL*
I
enjoyed
every
moment
of
that
day
,
even
if
I
had
to
look
after
the
*NL*
children
all
the
time
.
I
lived
it
over
in
happy
dreams
for
years
.
*NL*
But
this
shore
is
nicer
than
the
Marysville
shore
.
Are
n't
those
gulls
*NL*
splendid
?
Would
you
like
to
be
a
gull
?
I
think
I
would
--
that
is
,
if
I
*NL*
could
n't
be
a
human
girl
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
would
be
nice
to
wake
up
at
*NL*
sunrise
and
swoop
down
over
the
water
and
away
out
over
that
lovely
blue
*NL*
all
day
;
and
then
at
night
to
fly
back
to
one
's
nest
?
Oh
,
I
can
just
*NL*
imagine
myself
doing
it

What
big
house
is
that
just
ahead
,
please
?

*NL*
``
That

the

There

heaps

They

this

is
just
about
right

Marilla
Makes
Up
Her
Mind
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Get
there
they
did
,
however
,
in
due
season
.
Mrs.
Spencer
lived
in
a
big
*NL*
yellow
house
at
White
Sands
Cove
,
and
she
came
to
the
door
with
surprise
*NL*
and
welcome
mingled
on
her
benevolent
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
dear
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
you
're
the
last
folks
I
was
looking
for
*NL*
today
,
but
I
'm
real
glad
to
see
you

You
'll
put
your
horse
in

And
how

are
you

Anne
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
as
well
as
can
be
expected

you

said
Anne
smilelessly
.
A
*NL*
blight
seemed
to
have
descended
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
'll
stay
a
little
while
to
rest
the
mare

said
Marilla
,
*NL*
``
but
I
promised
Matthew

be
home
early

The
fact
is

Mrs.

*NL*
there
's
been
a
queer
mistake
somewhere

and
I
've
come
over
to
see
where
*NL*
it
is

We
send

Matthew

for
you
to
bring

eleven

*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
Cuthbert

so

Mrs.
Spencer
in
distress
.
*NL*
``
Why

Robert
sent
word
down
by
his
daughter
Nancy
and
she
said
you
*NL*
wanted
a
girl

did
n't
she
Flora
Jane

appealing
to
her
daughter
who
had
*NL*
come
out
to
the
steps

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
certainly
did

corroborated
Flora
Jane
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
dreadful
sorry

''
said
Mrs.
Spencer
.
``
It
's
too
bad
;
but
it
certainly
*NL*
was
n't
my
fault

you
see
,
Miss
Cuthbert

I
did
the
best
I
could
and
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
following
your
instructions

Nancy
is
a
terrible
flighty

thing

I
've
often
had
to
scold
her
well
for
her
heedlessness

*NL*
``
It
was

Marilla
resignedly

you
ourselves

not
left
an
important
message

be
passed
along

Anyhow
,
the
mistake
has
been
made

the
*NL*
only
thing
to
do
is
to
set
it
right

Can
we
send
the
child
back

back

thoughtfully

Mrs.

up

yesterday

be

I

call
it
positively
providential

*NL*
Marilla
did
not
look
as
if
she
thought
Providence
had
much
to
do
with
*NL*
the
matter

Here
was
an
unexpectedly
good
chance
to
get
this
unwelcome
*NL*
orphan
off
her
hands
,
and
she
did
not
even
feel
grateful
for
it

*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
Mrs.
Peter
Blewett
only
by
sight
as
a
small
,
shrewish-faced
*NL*
woman
without
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
on
her
bones

But
she
had
*NL*
heard
of
her

``
A
terrible
worker

driver

Mrs.
Peter
was
said
to
*NL*
be
;
and
discharged
servant
girls
told
fearsome
tales
of
her
temper
and
*NL*
stinginess
,
and
her
family
of
pert
,
quarrelsome
children

Marilla
felt
*NL*
a
qualm

conscience
at
the
thought
of
handing
Anne
over
to
her
tender

mercies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'll
go
in
and
we
'll
talk
the
matter
over

she
said

``
And

Peter
coming
up

lane

exclaimed
Mrs.
Spencer
,
bustling
her
guests
through
the
hall
into
the
*NL*
parlor
,
where
a
deadly
chill
struck
on
them
as
if
the
air
had
been
*NL*
strained
so
long
through
dark
green
,
closely
drawn
blinds
that
it

lost
every

warmth
it
had
ever
possessed

That
is
real

Take
the

Mrs.

whisked
away

after
pulling
up
the
blinds

Anne
sitting
*NL*
mutely
on
the
ottoman
,
with
her
hands
clasped
tightly
in
her
lap
,
stared
*NL*
at
Mrs
Blewett
as
one
fascinated
.
Was
she
to
be
given
into
the
keeping
*NL*
of
this
sharp-faced
,
sharp-eyed
woman
?
She
felt
a
lump
coming
up
in
her
*NL*
throat
and
her
eyes
smarted
painfully
.
She
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
*NL*
she
could
n't
keep
the
tears
back
when
Mrs.
Spencer
returned

flushed
*NL*
and
beaming

quite
capable

taking
any

every
difficulty

physical
,
*NL*
mental

spiritual
,
into
consideration
and
settling
it
out

``
It

said
.
``

under
the
impression
that
Mr.
and
Miss
Cuthbert
wanted
*NL*
a
little
girl
to
adopt
.
I
was
certainly
told
so
.
But
it
seems
it
was
a
*NL*
boy
they
wanted
.
So
if
you
're
still
of
the
same
mind
you
were
yesterday
,
*NL*
I
think
she
'll
be
just
the
thing
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Blewett
darted
her
eyes
over
Anne
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
and
what
's
your
name
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
''
faltered
the
shrinking
child
,
not
daring
to
make
any
*NL*
stipulations
regarding
the
spelling
thereof
,
``
and
I
'm
eleven
years
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
You
do
n't
look
as
if
there
was
much
to
you
.
But
you
're
wiry
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
but
the
wiry
ones
are
the
best
after
all
.
Well
,
if
I
take
you
*NL*
you
'll
have
to
be
a
good
girl
,
you
know
--
good
and
smart
and
respectful
.
*NL*
I
'll
expect
you
to
earn
your
keep
,
and
no
mistake
about
that
.
Yes
,
I
*NL*
suppose
I
might
as
well
take
her
off
your
hands
,
Miss
Cuthbert
.
The
*NL*
baby
's
awful
fractious
,
and
I
'm
clean
worn
out
attending
to
him
.
If
you
*NL*
like
I
can
take
her
right
home
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
at
Anne
and
softened
at
sight
of
the
child
's
pale
face
*NL*
with
its
look
of
mute
misery
--
the
misery
of
a
helpless
little
creature
*NL*
who
finds
itself
once
more
caught
in
the
trap
from
which
it
had
escaped
.
*NL*
Marilla
felt
an
uncomfortable
conviction
that
,
if
she
denied
the
appeal
*NL*
of
that
look
,
it
would
haunt
her
to
her
dying
day
.
More-over
,
she
did
*NL*
not
fancy
Mrs.
Blewett
.
To
hand
a
sensitive
,
``
highstrung
''
child
over
to
*NL*
such
a
woman
!
No
,
she
could
not
take
the
responsibility
of
doing
that
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
slowly
.
``
I
did
n't
say
that
Matthew
and
I
*NL*
had
absolutely
decided
that
we
would
n't
keep
her
.
In
fact
I
may
say
that
*NL*
Matthew
is
disposed
to
keep
her
.
I
just
came
over
to
find
out
how
the
*NL*
mistake
had
occurred
.
I
think
I
'd
better
take
her
home
again
and
talk
it
*NL*
over
with
Matthew
.
I
feel
that
I
ought
n't
to
decide
on
anything
without
*NL*
consulting
him
.
If
we
make
up
our
mind
not
to
keep
her
we
'll
bring
or
*NL*
send
her
over
to
you
tomorrow
night
.
If
we
do
n't
you
may
know
that
she
*NL*
is
going
to
stay
with
us
.
Will
that
suit
you
,
Mrs.
Blewett
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
'll
have
to
,
''
said
Mrs.
Blewett
ungraciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
Marilla
's
speech
a
sunrise
had
been
dawning
on
Anne
's
face
.
First
*NL*
the
look
of
despair
faded
out
;
then
came
a
faint
flush
of
hope
;
*NL*
her
eyes
grew
deep
and
bright
as
morning
stars
.
The
child
was
quite
*NL*
transfigured
;
and
,
a
moment
later
,
when
Mrs.
Spencer
and
Mrs.
Blewett
*NL*
went
out
in
quest
of
a
recipe
the
latter
had
come
to
borrow
she
sprang
*NL*
up
and
flew
across
the
room
to
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Miss
Cuthbert
,
did
you
really
say
that
perhaps
you
would
let
me
*NL*
stay
at
Green
Gables
?
''
she
said
,
in
a
breathless
whisper
,
as
if
speaking
*NL*
aloud
might
shatter
the
glorious
possibility
.
``
Did
you
really
say
it
?
Or
*NL*
did
I
only
imagine
that
you
did
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
'd
better
learn
to
control
that
imagination
of
yours
,
Anne
,
*NL*
if
you
ca
n't
distinguish
between
what
is
real
and
what
is
n't
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
crossly
.
``
Yes
,
you
did
hear
me
say
just
that
and
no
more
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
decided
yet
and
perhaps
we
will
conclude
to
let
Mrs.
Blewett
take
*NL*
you
after
all
.
She
certainly
needs
you
much
more
than
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
go
back
to
the
asylum
than
go
to
live
with
her
,
''
said
Anne
*NL*
passionately
.
``
She
looks
exactly
like
a
--
like
a
gimlet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
smothered
a
smile
under
the
conviction
that
Anne
must
be
*NL*
reproved
for
such
a
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
girl
like
you
should
be
ashamed
of
talking
so
about
a
lady
and
*NL*
a
stranger
,
''
she
said
severely
.
``
Go
back
and
sit
down
quietly
and
hold
*NL*
your
tongue
and
behave
as
a
good
girl
should
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
do
and
be
anything
you
want
me
,
if
you
'll
only
keep
me
,
''
*NL*
said
Anne
,
returning
meekly
to
her
ottoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
back
at
Green
Gables
that
evening
Matthew
met
them
in
*NL*
the
lane
.
Marilla
from
afar
had
noted
him
prowling
along
it
and
guessed
*NL*
his
motive
.
She
was
prepared
for
the
relief
she
read
in
his
face
when
he
*NL*
saw
that
she
had
at
least
brought
back
Anne
back
with
her
.
But
she
said
*NL*
nothing
,
to
him
,
relative
to
the
affair
,
until
they
were
both
out
in
the
*NL*
yard
behind
the
barn
milking
the
cows
.
Then
she
briefly
told
him
Anne
's
*NL*
history
and
the
result
of
the
interview
with
Mrs.
Spencer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
give
a
dog
I
liked
to
that
Blewett
woman
,
''
said
Matthew
with
*NL*
unusual
vim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
fancy
her
style
myself
,
''
admitted
Marilla
,
``
but
it
's
that
*NL*
or
keeping
her
ourselves
,
Matthew
.
And
since
you
seem
to
want
her
,
I
*NL*
suppose
I
'm
willing
--
or
have
to
be
.
I
've
been
thinking
over
the
idea
*NL*
until
I
've
got
kind
of
used
to
it
.
It
seems
a
sort
of
duty
.
I
've
never
*NL*
brought
up
a
child
,
especially
a
girl
,
and
I
dare
say
I
'll
make
a
*NL*
terrible
mess
of
it
.
But
I
'll
do
my
best
.
So
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
*NL*
Matthew
,
she
may
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
's
shy
face
was
a
glow
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
reckoned
you
'd
come
to
see
it
in
that
light
,
Marilla
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
She
's
such
an
interesting
little
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'd
be
more
to
the
point
if
you
could
say
she
was
a
useful
little
*NL*
thing
,
''
retorted
Marilla
,
``
but
I
'll
make
it
my
business
to
see
she
's
*NL*
trained
to
be
that
.
And
mind
,
Matthew
,
you
're
not
to
go
interfering
with
*NL*
my
methods
.
Perhaps
an
old
maid
does
n't
know
much
about
bringing
up
*NL*
a
child
,
but
I
guess
she
knows
more
than
an
old
bachelor
.
So
you
just
*NL*
leave
me
to
manage
her
.
When
I
fail
it
'll
be
time
enough
to
put
your
oar
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
Marilla
,
you
can
have
your
own
way
,
''
said
Matthew
*NL*
reassuringly
.
``
Only
be
as
good
and
kind
to
her
as
you
can
without
*NL*
spoiling
her
.
I
kind
of
think
she
's
one
of
the
sort
you
can
do
anything
*NL*
with
if
you
only
get
her
to
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
sniffed
,
to
express
her
contempt
for
Matthew
's
opinions
*NL*
concerning
anything
feminine
,
and
walked
off
to
the
dairy
with
the
*NL*
pails
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
tell
her
tonight
that
she
can
stay
,
''
she
reflected
,
as
she
*NL*
strained
the
milk
into
the
creamers
.
``
She
'd
be
so
excited
that
she
*NL*
would
n't
sleep
a
wink
.
Marilla
Cuthbert
,
you
're
fairly
in
for
it
.
Did
*NL*
you
ever
suppose
you
'd
see
the
day
when
you
'd
be
adopting
an
orphan
*NL*
girl
?
It
's
surprising
enough
;
but
not
so
surprising
as
that
Matthew
*NL*
should
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
,
him
that
always
seemed
to
have
such
a
*NL*
mortal
dread
of
little
girls
.
Anyhow
,
we
've
decided
on
the
experiment
*NL*
and
goodness
only
knows
what
will
come
of
it
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
Anne
Says
Her
Prayers
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
took
Anne
up
to
bed
that
night
she
said
stiffly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Anne
,
I
noticed
last
night
that
you
threw
your
clothes
all
about
*NL*
the
floor
when
you
took
them
off
.
That
is
a
very
untidy
habit
,
and
I
*NL*
ca
n't
allow
it
at
all
.
As
soon
as
you
take
off
any
article
of
clothing
*NL*
fold
it
neatly
and
place
it
on
the
chair
.
I
have
n't
any
use
at
all
for
*NL*
little
girls
who
are
n't
neat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
so
harrowed
up
in
my
mind
last
night
that
I
did
n't
think
about
my
*NL*
clothes
at
all
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
I
'll
fold
them
nicely
tonight
.
They
always
*NL*
made
us
do
that
at
the
asylum
.
Half
the
time
,
though
,
I
'd
forget
,
I
'd
be
*NL*
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
into
bed
nice
and
quiet
and
imagine
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
remember
a
little
better
if
you
stay
here
,
''
admonished
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
There
,
that
looks
something
like
.
Say
your
prayers
now
and
get
*NL*
into
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
say
any
prayers
,
''
announced
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
horrified
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Anne
,
what
do
you
mean
?
Were
you
never
taught
to
say
your
prayers
?
*NL*
God
always
wants
little
girls
to
say
their
prayers
.
Do
n't
you
know
who
*NL*
God
is
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
God
is
a
spirit
,
infinite
,
eternal
and
unchangeable
,
in
His
being
,
*NL*
wisdom
,
power
,
holiness
,
justice
,
goodness
,
and
truth
,
'
''
responded
Anne
*NL*
promptly
and
glibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
rather
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
know
something
then
,
thank
goodness
!
You
're
not
quite
a
*NL*
heathen
.
Where
did
you
learn
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
at
the
asylum
Sunday-school
.
They
made
us
learn
the
whole
*NL*
catechism
.
I
liked
it
pretty
well
.
There
's
something
splendid
about
some
*NL*
of
the
words
.
`
Infinite
,
eternal
and
unchangeable
.
'
Is
n't
that
grand
?
It
*NL*
has
such
a
roll
to
it
--
just
like
a
big
organ
playing
.
You
could
n't
quite
*NL*
call
it
poetry
,
I
suppose
,
but
it
sounds
a
lot
like
it
,
does
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
talking
about
poetry
,
Anne
--
we
are
talking
about
saying
your
*NL*
prayers
.
Do
n't
you
know
it
's
a
terrible
wicked
thing
not
to
say
your
*NL*
prayers
every
night
?
I
'm
afraid
you
are
a
very
bad
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
find
it
easier
to
be
bad
than
good
if
you
had
red
hair
,
''
said
*NL*
Anne
reproachfully
.
``
People
who
have
n't
red
hair
do
n't
know
what
trouble
*NL*
is
.
Mrs.
Thomas
told
me
that
God
made
my
hair
red
ON
PURPOSE
,
and
I
've
*NL*
never
cared
about
Him
since
.
And
anyhow
I
'd
always
be
too
tired
at
night
*NL*
to
bother
saying
prayers
.
People
who
have
to
look
after
twins
ca
n't
be
*NL*
expected
to
say
their
prayers
.
Now
,
do
you
honestly
think
they
can
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
decided
that
Anne
's
religious
training
must
be
begun
at
once
.
*NL*
Plainly
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
say
your
prayers
while
you
are
under
my
roof
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
,
if
you
want
me
to
,
''
assented
Anne
cheerfully
.
``
I
'd
do
*NL*
anything
to
oblige
you
.
But
you
'll
have
to
tell
me
what
to
say
for
this
*NL*
once
.
After
I
get
into
bed
I
'll
imagine
out
a
real
nice
prayer
to
say
*NL*
always
.
I
believe
that
it
will
be
quite
interesting
,
now
that
I
come
to
*NL*
think
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
kneel
down
,
''
said
Marilla
in
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
knelt
at
Marilla
's
knee
and
looked
up
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
people
kneel
down
to
pray
?
If
I
really
wanted
to
pray
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
what
I
'd
do
.
I
'd
go
out
into
a
great
big
field
all
alone
*NL*
or
into
the
deep
,
deep
,
woods
,
and
I
'd
look
up
into
the
*NL*
sky
--
up
--
up
--
up
--
into
that
lovely
blue
sky
that
looks
as
if
there
was
no
*NL*
end
to
its
blueness
.
And
then
I
'd
just
FEEL
a
prayer
.
Well
,
I
'm
ready
.
*NL*
What
am
I
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
felt
more
embarrassed
than
ever
.
She
had
intended
to
teach
Anne
*NL*
the
childish
classic
,
``
Now
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
.
''
But
she
had
,
as
*NL*
I
have
told
you
,
the
glimmerings
of
a
sense
of
humor
--
which
is
simply
*NL*
another
name
for
a
sense
of
fitness
of
things
;
and
it
suddenly
occurred
*NL*
to
her
that
that
simple
little
prayer
,
sacred
to
white-robed
childhood
*NL*
lisping
at
motherly
knees
,
was
entirely
unsuited
to
this
freckled
witch
*NL*
of
a
girl
who
knew
and
cared
nothing
about
God
's
love
,
since
she
had
*NL*
never
had
it
translated
to
her
through
the
medium
of
human
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
old
enough
to
pray
for
yourself
,
Anne
,
''
she
said
finally
.
``
Just
*NL*
thank
God
for
your
blessings
and
ask
Him
humbly
for
the
things
you
*NL*
want

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
do
my
best

promised
Anne
,
burying
her
face
in
Marilla
's
*NL*
lap
.
``
Gracious
heavenly
Father
--
that
's
the
way
the
ministers
say
it
in
*NL*
church
,
so
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
in
private
prayer
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
*NL*
interjected
,
lifting
her
head
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
heavenly
Father
,
I
thank
Thee
for
the
White
*NL*
Way
of
Delight
and
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
and
Bonny
*NL*
and
the
Snow
Queen
.
I
'm
really
extremely
grateful
for
*NL*
them
.
And
that
's
all
the
blessings
I
can
think
of
just
*NL*
now
to
thank
Thee
for
.
As
for
the
things
I
want
,
*NL*
they
're
so
numerous
that
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
time
to
name
them
all
so
I
will
only
mention
the
two
*NL*
most
important
.
Please
let
me
stay
at
Green
Gables
;
*NL*
and
please
let
me
be
good-looking
when
I
grow
up
.
*NL*
I
remain
,
*NL*
``
Yours
respectfully

*NL*
Anne
Shirley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
did
I
do
all
right
?
''
she
asked
eagerly
,
getting
up
.
``
I
could
*NL*
have
made
it
much
more
flowery
if
I
'd
had
a
little
more
time
to
think
it
*NL*
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Marilla
was
only
preserved
from
complete
collapse
by
remembering
*NL*
that
it
was
not
irreverence
,
but
simply
spiritual
ignorance
on
the
part
*NL*
of
Anne
that
was
responsible
for
this
extraordinary
petition
.
She
tucked
*NL*
the
child
up
in
bed
,
mentally
vowing
that
she
should
be
taught
a
prayer
*NL*
the
very
next
day
,
and
was
leaving
the
room
with
the
light
when
Anne
*NL*
called
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
just
thought
of
it
now
.
I
should
have
said
,
`
Amen
'
in
place
*NL*
of
`
yours
respectfully
,
'
should
n't
I
?
--
the
way
the
ministers
do
.
I
'd
*NL*
forgotten
it
,
but
I
felt
a
prayer
should
be
finished
off
in
some
way
,
so
*NL*
I
put
in
the
other
.
Do
you
suppose
it
will
make
any
difference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
do
n't
suppose
it
will
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
Go
to
sleep
now
like
a
good
*NL*
child
.
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
say
good
night
tonight
with
a
clear
conscience
,
''
said
Anne
,
*NL*
cuddling
luxuriously
down
among
her
pillows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
retreated
to
the
kitchen
,
set
the
candle
firmly
on
the
table
,
*NL*
and
glared
at
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
it
's
about
time
somebody
adopted
that
child
and
*NL*
taught
her
something
.
She
's
next
door
to
a
perfect
heathen
.
Will
you
*NL*
believe
that
she
never
said
a
prayer
in
her
life
till
tonight
?
I
'll
send
*NL*
her
to
the
manse
tomorrow
and
borrow
the
Peep
of
the
Day
series
,
that
's
*NL*
what
I
'll
do
.
And
she
shall
go
to
Sunday-school
just
as
soon
as
I
can
*NL*
get
some
suitable
clothes
made
for
her
.
I
foresee
that
I
shall
have
*NL*
my
hands
full
.
Well
,
well
,
we
ca
n't
get
through
this
world
without
our
*NL*
share
of
trouble

I
've
had
a
pretty
easy
life
of
it
so
far
,

my
time

has
come
at

to
make

CHAPTER
VIII
.
Anne
's
Bringing-up
Is
Begun
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
reasons
best
known
to
herself
,
Marilla
did
not
tell
Anne
that
*NL*
she
was
to
stay
at
Green
Gables
until
the
next
afternoon
.
During
the
*NL*
forenoon
she
kept
the
child
busy
with
various
tasks
and
watched
over
her
*NL*
with
a
keen
eye
while
she
did
them
.
By
noon
she
had
concluded
that
Anne
*NL*
was
smart
and
obedient
,
willing
to
work
and
quick
to
learn
;
her
most
*NL*
serious
shortcoming
seemed
to
be
a
tendency
to
fall
into
daydreams
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
task
and
forget
all
about
it
until
such
time
as
she
was
*NL*
sharply
recalled
to
earth
by
a
reprimand
or
a
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anne
had
finished
washing
the
dinner
dishes
she
suddenly
confronted
*NL*
Marilla
with
the
air
and
expression
of
one
desperately
determined
to
*NL*
learn
the
worst
.
Her
thin
little
body
trembled
from
head
to
foot
;
her
*NL*
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
dilated
until
they
were
almost
black
;
she
*NL*
clasped
her
hands
tightly
and
said
in
an
imploring
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
Miss
Cuthbert
,
wo
n't
you
tell
me
if
you
are
going
to
send
*NL*
me
away
or
not
?
I
've
tried
to
be
patient
all
the
morning
,
but
I
really
*NL*
feel
that
I
can
not
bear
not
knowing
any
longer
.
It
's
a
dreadful
feeling
.
*NL*
Please
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
scalded
the
dishcloth
in
clean
hot
water
as
I
told
you
to
*NL*
do
,
''
said
Marilla
immovably
.
``
Just
go
and
do
it
before
you
ask
any
more
*NL*
questions
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
and
attended
to
the
dishcloth
.
Then
she
returned
to
Marilla
*NL*
and
fastened
imploring
eyes
of
the
latter
's
face
.
``
Well
,
''
said
Marilla
,
*NL*
unable
to
find
any
excuse
for
deferring
her
explanation
longer
,
``
I
*NL*
suppose
I
might
as
well
tell
you
.
Matthew
and
I
have
decided
to
keep
*NL*
you
--
that
is
,
if
you
will
try
to
be
a
good
little
girl
and
show
yourself
*NL*
grateful
.
Why
,
child
,
whatever
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
crying
,
''
said
Anne
in
a
tone
of
bewilderment
.
``
I
ca
n't
think
why
.
*NL*
I
'm
glad
as
glad
can
be
.
Oh
,
GLAD
does
n't
seem
the
right
word
at
all
.
I
*NL*
was
glad
about
the
White
Way
and
the
cherry
blossoms
--
but
this
!
Oh
,
it
's
*NL*
something
more
than
glad
.
I
'm
so
happy
.
I
'll
try
to
be
so
good
.
It
*NL*
will
be
uphill
work
,
I
expect
,
for
Mrs.
Thomas
often
told
me
I
was
*NL*
desperately
wicked
.
However
,
I
'll
do
my
very
best
.
But
can
you
tell
me
*NL*
why
I
'm
crying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
's
because
you
're
all
excited
and
worked
up
,
''
said
Marilla
*NL*
disapprovingly
.
``
Sit
down
on
that
chair
and
try
to
calm
yourself
.
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
you
both
cry
and
laugh
far
too
easily
.
Yes
,
you
can
stay
here
and
*NL*
we
will
try
to
do
right
by
you
.
You
must
go
to
school
;
but
it
's
only
a
*NL*
fortnight
till
vacation
so
it
is
n't
worth
while
for
you
to
start
before
*NL*
it
opens
again
in
September
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
call
you
?
''
asked
Anne
.
``
Shall
I
always
say
Miss
Cuthbert
?
*NL*
Can
I
call
you
Aunt
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
'll
call
me
just
plain
Marilla
.
I
'm
not
used
to
being
called
*NL*
Miss
Cuthbert
and
it
would
make
me
nervous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
awfully
disrespectful
to
just
say
Marilla
,
''
protested
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
there
'll
be
nothing
disrespectful
in
it
if
you
're
careful
*NL*
to
speak
respectfully
.
Everybody
,
young
and
old
,
in
Avonlea
calls
me
*NL*
Marilla
except
the
minister
.
He
says
Miss
Cuthbert
--
when
he
thinks
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
love
to
call
you
Aunt
Marilla
,
''
said
Anne
wistfully
.
``
I
've
never
*NL*
had
an
aunt
or
any
relation
at
all
--
not
even
a
grandmother
.
It
would
*NL*
make
me
feel
as
if
I
really
belonged
to
you
.
Ca
n't
I
call
you
Aunt
*NL*
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
not
your
aunt
and
I
do
n't
believe
in
calling
people
names
that
*NL*
do
n't
belong
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
could
imagine
you
were
my
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
,
''
said
Marilla
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
never
imagine
things
different
from
what
they
really
are
?
''
asked
*NL*
Anne
wide-eyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Anne
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
Oh
,
Miss
--
Marilla
,
how
much
you
miss
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
in
imagining
things
different
from
what
they
really
*NL*
are
,
''
retorted
Marilla
.
``
When
the
Lord
puts
us
in
certain
circumstances
*NL*
He
does
n't
mean
for
us
to
imagine
them
away
.
And
that
reminds
me
.
Go
*NL*
into
the
sitting
room
,
Anne
--
be
sure
your
feet
are
clean
and
do
n't
*NL*
let
any
flies
in
--
and
bring
me
out
the
illustrated
card
that
's
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
The
Lord
's
Prayer
is
on
it
and
you
'll
devote
your
spare
*NL*
time
this
afternoon
to
learning
it
off
by
heart
.
There
's
to
be
no
more
*NL*
of
such
praying
as
I
heard
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
was
very
awkward
,
''
said
Anne
apologetically
,
``
but
then
,
you
*NL*
see
,
I
'd
never
had
any
practice
.
You
could
n't
really
expect
a
person
*NL*
to
pray
very
well
the
first
time
she
tried
,
could
you
?
I
thought
out
a
*NL*
splendid
prayer
after
I
went
to
bed
,
just
as
I
promised
you
I
would
.
*NL*
It
was
nearly
as
long
as
a
minister
's
and
so
poetical
.
But
would
you
*NL*
believe
it
?
I
could
n't
remember
one
word
when
I
woke
up
this
morning
.
*NL*
And
I
'm
afraid
I
'll
never
be
able
to
think
out
another
one
as
good
.
*NL*
Somehow
,
things
never
are
so
good
when
they
're
thought
out
a
second
*NL*
time
.
Have
you
ever
noticed
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
something
for
you
to
notice
,
Anne
.
When
I
tell
you
to
do
*NL*
a
thing
I
want
you
to
obey
me
at
once
and
not
stand
stock-still
and
*NL*
discourse
about
it
.
Just
you
go
and
do
as
I
bid
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
promptly
departed
for
the
sitting-room
across
the
hall
;
she
failed
*NL*
to
return
;
after
waiting
ten
minutes
Marilla
laid
down
her
knitting
*NL*
and
marched
after
her
with
a
grim
expression
.
She
found
Anne
standing
*NL*
motionless
before
a
picture
hanging
on
the
wall
between
the
two
windows
,
*NL*
with
her
eyes
astar
with
dreams
.
The
white
and
green
light
strained
*NL*
through
apple
trees
and
clustering
vines
outside
fell
over
the
rapt
*NL*
little
figure
with
a
half-unearthly
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
whatever
are
you
thinking
of
?
''
demanded
Marilla
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
came
back
to
earth
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
she
said
,
pointing
to
the
picture
--
a
rather
vivid
chromo
*NL*
entitled
,
``
Christ
Blessing
Little
Children
''
--
``
and
I
was
just
imagining
I
*NL*
was
one
of
them
--
that
I
was
the
little
girl
in
the
blue
dress
,
standing
*NL*
off
by
herself
in
the
corner
as
if
she
did
n't
belong
to
anybody
,
like
*NL*
me
.
She
looks
lonely
and
sad
,
do
n't
you
think
?
I
guess
she
had
n't
any
*NL*
father
or
mother
of
her
own
.
But
she
wanted
to
be
blessed
,
too
,
so
she
*NL*
just
crept
shyly
up
on
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
hoping
nobody
would
*NL*
notice
her
--
except
Him
.
I
'm
sure
I
know
just
how
she
felt
.
Her
heart
*NL*
must
have
beat
and
her
hands
must
have
got
cold
,
like
mine
did
when
I
*NL*
asked
you
if
I
could
stay
.
She
was
afraid
He
might
n't
notice
her
.
But
*NL*
it
's
likely
He
did
,
do
n't
you
think
?
I
've
been
trying
to
imagine
it
all
*NL*
out
--
her
edging
a
little
nearer
all
the
time
until
she
was
quite
close
*NL*
to
Him
;
and
then
He
would
look
at
her
and
put
His
hand
on
her
hair
and
*NL*
oh
,
such
a
thrill
of
joy
as
would
run
over
her
!
But
I
wish
the
artist
*NL*
had
n't
painted
Him
so
sorrowful
looking
.
All
His
pictures
are
like
that
,
*NL*
if
you
've
noticed
.
But
I
do
n't
believe
He
could
really
have
looked
so
*NL*
sad
or
the
children
would
have
been
afraid
of
Him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
,
wondering
why
she
had
not
broken
into
this
speech
*NL*
long
before
,
``
you
should
n't
talk
that
way
.
It
's
irreverent
--
positively
*NL*
irreverent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
eyes
marveled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
felt
just
as
reverent
as
could
be
.
I
'm
sure
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
*NL*
irreverent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
I
do
n't
suppose
you
did
--
but
it
does
n't
sound
right
to
talk
so
*NL*
familiarly
about
such
things
.
And
another
thing
,
Anne
,
when
I
send
you
*NL*
after
something
you
're
to
bring
it
at
once
and
not
fall
into
mooning
and
*NL*
imagining
before
pictures
.
Remember
that
.
Take
that
card
and
come
right
*NL*
to
the
kitchen
.
Now
,
sit
down
in
the
corner
and
learn
that
prayer
off
by
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
set
the
card
up
against
the
jugful
of
apple
blossoms
she
had
*NL*
brought
in
to

the
dinner-table
--
Marilla
had
eyed
that
*NL*
decoration
askance
,
but
had
said
nothing
--
propped
her
chin
on
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
fell
to
studying
it
intently
for
several
silent
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
this
,
''
she
announced
at
length
.
``
It
's
beautiful
.
I
've
heard
it
*NL*
before
--
I
heard
the
superintendent
of
the
asylum
Sunday
school
say
it
*NL*
over
once
.
But
I
did
n't
like
it
then
.
He
had
such
a
cracked
voice
and
*NL*
he
prayed
it
so
mournfully
.
I
really
felt
sure
he
thought
praying
was
a
*NL*
disagreeable
duty
.
This
is
n't
poetry
,
but
it
makes
me
feel
just
the
same
*NL*
way
poetry
does
.

Our
Father
who
art
in

hallowed
be
Thy

*NL*
That
is
just
like

of
music

Oh

I
'm
so
glad
you
thought
of
making
*NL*
me
learn
this

Marilla

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

learn
it

hold
your

said
Marilla
shortly

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
tipped
the
vase
of
apple
blossoms
near
enough
to
bestow
a
soft
*NL*
kiss
on
a
pink-cupped
bud
,
and
then
studied
diligently
for
some
moments
*NL*
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
demanded
presently
,
``

you

ever

I
've
dreamed
of

my

never
really

Diana
Barry
lives
over
at

she

about

She

a

will
be

She

Anne
looked
at

through

her

aglow
with

interest

is
good
and
smart
,
which
is
better
than
being
*NL*
pretty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
was
as
fond
of
morals
as
the
Duchess
in
Wonderland
,
and
was
*NL*
firmly
convinced
that
one
should
be
tacked
on
to
every
remark
made
to
a
*NL*
child
who
was
being
brought
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anne
waved
the
moral
inconsequently
aside
and
seized
only
on
the
*NL*
delightful
possibilities
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
she
's
pretty
.
Next
to
being
beautiful
oneself
--
and
*NL*
that
's
impossible
in
my
case
--
it
would
be
best
to
have
a
beautiful
bosom
*NL*
friend
.
When
I
lived
with
Mrs.
Thomas
she
had
a
bookcase
in
her
sitting
*NL*
room
with
glass
doors
.
There
were
n't
any
books
in
it
;
Mrs.
Thomas
kept
*NL*
her
best
china
and
her
preserves
there
--
when
she
had
any
preserves
to
*NL*
keep
.
One
of
the
doors
was
broken
.
Mr.
Thomas
smashed
it
one
night
*NL*
when
he
was
slightly
intoxicated
.
But
the
other
was
whole
and
I
used
to
*NL*
pretend
that
my
reflection
in
it
was
another
little
girl
who
lived
in
*NL*
it
.
I
called
her
Katie
Maurice
,
and
we
were
very
intimate
.
I
used
to
*NL*
talk
to
her
by
the
hour
,
especially
on
Sunday
,
and
tell
her
everything
.
*NL*
Katie
was
the
comfort
and
consolation
of
my
life
.
We
used
to
pretend
*NL*
that
the
bookcase
was
enchanted
and
that
if
I
only
knew
the
spell
I
*NL*
could
open
the
door
and
step
right
into
the
room
where
Katie
Maurice
*NL*
lived
,
instead
of
into
Mrs.
Thomas
'
shelves
of
preserves
and
china
.
And
*NL*
then
Katie
Maurice
would
have
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
out
into
a
*NL*
wonderful
place
,
all
flowers
and
sunshine
and
fairies
,
and
we
would
have
*NL*
lived
there
happy
for
ever
after
.
When
I
went
to
live
with
Mrs.
Hammond
*NL*
it
just
broke
my
heart
to
leave
Katie
Maurice
.
She
felt
it
dreadfully
,
*NL*
too
,
I
know
she
did
,
for
she
was
crying
when
she
kissed
me
good-bye
*NL*
through
the
bookcase
door
.
There
was
no
bookcase
at
Mrs.
Hammond
's
.
But
*NL*
just
up
the
river
a
little
way
from
the
house
there
was
a
long
green
*NL*
little
valley
,
and
the
loveliest
echo
lived
there
.
It
echoed
back
every
*NL*
word
you
said
,
even
if
you
did
n't
talk
a
bit
loud
.
So
I
imagined
that
it
*NL*
was
a
little
girl
called
Violetta
and
we
were
great
friends
and
I
loved
*NL*
her
almost
as
well
as
I
loved
Katie
Maurice
--
not
quite
,
but
almost
,
you
*NL*
know
.
The
night
before
I
went
to
the
asylum
I
said
good-bye
to
Violetta
,
*NL*
and
oh
,
her
good-bye
came
back
to
me
in
such
sad
,
sad
tones
.
I
had
*NL*
become
so
attached
to
her
that
I
had
n't
the
heart
to
imagine
a
bosom
*NL*
friend
at
the
asylum
,
even
if
there
had
been
any
scope
for
imagination
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
just
as
well
there
was
n't
,
''
said
Marilla
drily
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
approve
of
such
goings-on
.
You
seem
to
half
believe
your
own
*NL*
imaginations
.
It
will
be
well
for
you
to
have
a
real
live
friend
to
*NL*
put
such
nonsense
out
of
your
head
.
But
do
n't
let
Mrs.
Barry
hear
you
*NL*
talking
about
your
Katie
Maurices
and
your
Violettas
or
she
'll
think
you
*NL*
tell
stories

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
wo
n't
.
I
could
n't
talk
of
them
to
everybody

their
memories
are
*NL*
too
sacred
for
that
.
But
I
thought
I
'd
like
to
have
you
know
about
them

Oh

look

here
's
a
big
bee
just
tumbled
out

an

blossom

think
what
a

to
live

in
an
apple
blossom

Fancy
going
to
*NL*
sleep
in
it
when
the
wind
was
rocking
it

If
I
was
n't
a
human
girl
I
*NL*

I
'd
like
to
be
a
bee

live
among
the
flowers

*NL*
``
Yesterday
you
wanted

be

gull

sniffed
Marilla

fickle
minded

told

it
seems
impossible
for
you

stop
talking

got
anybody

will
listen

you

So
go
up

Anne

that

IRRESISTIBLE

Anne
sighed
,
retreated
to
the
east
gable

sat
down
in
a
chair
by
the
*NL*
window

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
I
know
this
prayer

I
learned
that

upstairs

Now
I
'm
going
to
imagine
things
into
this
room
so
that
they
'll

always
stay

floor

covered
with

with

all
over

hung

furniture
is
mahogany

I
never
saw

heaped

danced
up
to

peered
into

pointed
freckled

CHAPTER
IX
.
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
Is
Properly
Horrified
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
been
a
fortnight
at
Green
Gables
before
Mrs.
Lynde
arrived
to
*NL*
inspect
her
.
Mrs.
Rachel
,
to
do
her
justice
,
was
not
to
blame
for
this
.
*NL*
A
severe
and
unseasonable
attack
of
grippe
had
confined
that
good
lady
*NL*
to
her
house
ever
since
the
occasion
of
her
last
visit
to
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
was
not
often
sick
and
had
a
well-defined
contempt
for
*NL*
people
who
were
;
but
grippe
,
she
asserted
,
was
like
no
other
illness
on
*NL*
earth
and
could
only
be
interpreted
as
one
of
the
special
visitations
*NL*
of
Providence
.
As
soon
as
her
doctor
allowed
her
to
put
her
foot
*NL*
out-of-doors
she
hurried
up
to
Green
Gables
,
bursting
with
curiosity
to
*NL*
see
Matthew
and
Marilla
's
orphan
,
concerning
whom
all
sorts
of
stories
*NL*
and
suppositions
had
gone
abroad
in
Avonlea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
made
good
use
of
every
waking
moment
of
that
fortnight
.
Already
*NL*
she
was
acquainted
with
every
tree
and
shrub
about
the
place
.
She
had
*NL*
discovered
that
a
lane
opened
out
below
the
apple
orchard
and
ran
up
*NL*
through
a
belt
of
woodland
;
and
she
had
explored
it
to
its
furthest
end
*NL*
in
all
its
delicious
vagaries
of
brook
and
bridge
,
fir
coppice
and
wild
*NL*
cherry
arch
,
corners
thick
with
fern
,
and
branching
byways
of
maple
and
*NL*
mountain
ash
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
friends
with
the
spring
down
in
the
hollow
--
that
wonderful
*NL*
deep
,
clear
icy-cold
spring
;
it
was
set
about
with
smooth
red
sandstones
*NL*
and
rimmed
in
by
great
palm-like
clumps
of
water
fern
;
and
beyond
it
was
*NL*
a
log
bridge
over
the
brook
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
bridge
led
Anne
's
dancing
feet
up
over
a
wooded
hill
beyond
,
where
*NL*
perpetual
twilight
reigned
under
the
straight
,
thick-growing
firs
and
*NL*
spruces
;
the
only
flowers
there
were
myriads
of
delicate
``
June
bells
,
''
*NL*
those
shyest
and
sweetest
of
woodland
blooms
,
and
a
few
pale
,
aerial
*NL*
starflowers
,
like
the
spirits
of
last
year
's
blossoms
.
Gossamers
*NL*
glimmered
like
threads
of
silver
among
the
trees
and
the
fir
boughs
and
*NL*
tassels
seemed
to
utter
friendly
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
raptured
voyages
of
exploration
were
made
in
the
odd
half
*NL*
hours
which
she
was
allowed
for
play
,
and
Anne
talked
Matthew
and
*NL*
Marilla
half-deaf
over
her
discoveries
.
Not
that
Matthew
complained
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
;
he
listened
to
it
all
with
a
wordless
smile
of
enjoyment
on
his
*NL*
face
;
Marilla
permitted
the
``
chatter
''
until
she
found
herself
becoming
*NL*
too
interested
in
it
,
whereupon
she
always
promptly
quenched
Anne
by
a
*NL*
curt
command
to
hold
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
out
in
the
orchard
when
Mrs.
Rachel
came
,
wandering
at
her
*NL*
own
sweet
will
through
the
lush
,
tremulous
grasses
splashed
with
ruddy
*NL*
evening
sunshine
;
so
that
good
lady
had
an
excellent
chance
to
talk
*NL*
her
illness
fully
over
,
describing
every
ache
and
pulse
beat
with
*NL*
such
evident
enjoyment
that
Marilla
thought
even
grippe
must
bring
its
*NL*
compensations
.
When
details
were
exhausted
Mrs.
Rachel
introduced
the
*NL*
real
reason
of
her
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
hearing
some
surprising
things
about
you
and
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
you
are
any
more
surprised
than
I
am
myself
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
I
'm
getting
over
my
surprise
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
too
bad
there
was
such
a
mistake
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rachel
*NL*
sympathetically
.
``
Could
n't
you
have
sent
her
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
could
,
but
we
decided
not
to
.
Matthew
took
a
fancy
to
her
.
*NL*
And
I
must
say
I
like
her
myself
--
although
I
admit
she
has
her
faults
.
*NL*
The
house
seems
a
different
place
already
.
She
's
a
real
bright
little
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
said
more
than
she
had
intended
to
say
when
she
began
,
for
she
*NL*
read
disapproval
in
Mrs.
Rachel
's
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
great
responsibility
you
've
taken
on
yourself
,
''
said
that
*NL*
lady
gloomily
,
``
especially
when
you
've
never
had
any
experience
with
*NL*
children
.
You
do
n't
know
much
about
her
or
her
real
disposition
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
and
there
's
no
guessing
how
a
child
like
that
will
turn
out
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
want
to
discourage
you
I
'm
sure
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
feeling
discouraged
,
''
was
Marilla
's
dry
response
,
``
when
I
make
*NL*
up
my
mind
to
do
a
thing
it
stays
made
up
.
I
suppose
you
'd
like
to
see
*NL*
Anne
.
I
'll
call
her
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
came
running
in
presently
,
her
face
sparkling
with
the
delight
of
*NL*
her
orchard
rovings
;
but
,
abashed
at
finding
the
delight
herself
in
*NL*
the
unexpected
presence
of
a
stranger
,
she
halted
confusedly
inside
*NL*
the
door
.
She
certainly
was
an
odd-looking
little
creature
in
the
short
*NL*
tight
wincey
dress
she
had
worn
from
the
asylum
,
below
which
her
thin
*NL*
legs
seemed
ungracefully
long
.
Her
freckles
were
more
numerous
and
*NL*
obtrusive
than
ever
;
the
wind
had
ruffled
her
hatless
hair
into
*NL*
over-brilliant
disorder
;
it
had
never
looked
redder
than
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
did
n't
pick
you
for
your
looks
,
that
's
sure
and
certain
,
''
*NL*
was
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
's
emphatic
comment
.
Mrs.
Rachel
was
one
of
those
*NL*
delightful
and
popular
people
who
pride
themselves
on
speaking
their
*NL*
mind
without
fear
or
favor
.
``
She
's
terrible
skinny
and
homely
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
Come
here
,
child
,
and
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
.
Lawful
heart
,
did
*NL*
any
one
ever
see
such
freckles
?
And
hair
as
red
as
carrots
!
Come
here
,
*NL*
child
,
I
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
``
came
there
,
''
but
not
exactly
as
Mrs.
Rachel
expected
.
With
one
*NL*
bound
she
crossed
the
kitchen
floor
and
stood
before
Mrs.
Rachel
,
her
*NL*
face
scarlet
with
anger
,
her
lips
quivering
,
and
her
whole
slender
form
*NL*
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
you
,
''
she
cried
in
a
choked
voice
,
stamping
her
foot
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
``
I
hate
you
--
I
hate
you
--
I
hate
you
--
''
a
louder
stamp
with
each
*NL*
assertion
of
hatred
.
``
How
dare
you
call
me
skinny
and
ugly
?
How
dare
*NL*
you
say
I
'm
freckled
and
redheaded
?
You
are
a
rude
,
impolite
,
unfeeling
*NL*
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
!
''
exclaimed
Marilla
in
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anne
continued
to
face
Mrs.
Rachel
undauntedly
,
head
up
,
eyes
*NL*
blazing
,
hands
clenched
,
passionate
indignation
exhaling
from
her
like
*NL*
an
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare
you
say
such
things
about
me
?
''
she
repeated
vehemently
.
``
How
*NL*
would
you
like
to
have
such
things
said
about
you
?
How
would
you
like
*NL*
to
be
told
that
you
are
fat
and
clumsy
and
probably
had
n't
a
spark
of
*NL*
imagination
in
you
?
I
do
n't
care
if
I
do
hurt
your
feelings
by
saying
*NL*
so
!
I
hope
I
hurt
them
.
You
have
hurt
mine
worse
than
they
were
ever
*NL*
hurt
before
even
by
Mrs.
Thomas
'
intoxicated
husband
.
And
I
'll
NEVER
*NL*
forgive
you
for
it
,
never
,
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stamp
!
Stamp
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anybody
ever
see
such
a
temper
!
''
exclaimed
the
horrified
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
go
to
your
room
and
stay
there
until
I
come
up
,
''
said
Marilla
,
*NL*
recovering
her
powers
of
speech
with
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
bursting
into
tears
,
rushed
to
the
hall
door
,
slammed
it
until
the
*NL*
tins
on
the
porch
wall
outside
rattled
in
sympathy
,
and
fled
through
the
*NL*
hall
and
up
the
stairs
like
a
whirlwind
.
A
subdued
slam
above
told
that
*NL*
the
door
of
the
east
gable
had
been
shut
with
equal
vehemence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
envy
you
your
job
bringing
THAT
up
,
Marilla
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
with
unspeakable
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
opened
her
lips
to
say
she
knew
not
what
of
apology
or
*NL*
deprecation
.
What
she
did
say
was
a
surprise
to
herself
then
and
ever
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
twitted
her
about
her
looks
,
Rachel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
Cuthbert
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
are
upholding
her
in
*NL*
such
a
terrible
display
of
temper
as
we
've
just
seen
?
''
demanded
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Marilla
slowly
,
``
I
'm
not
trying
to
excuse
her
.
She
's
been
*NL*
very
naughty
and
I
'll
have
to
give
her
a
talking
to
about
it
.
But
we
*NL*
must
make
allowances
for
her
.
She
's
never
been
taught
what
is
right
.
And
*NL*
you
WERE
too
hard
on
her
,
Rachel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
could
not
help
tacking
on
that
last
sentence
,
although
she
was
*NL*
again
surprised
at
herself
for
doing
it
.
Mrs.
Rachel
got
up
with
an
air
*NL*
of
offended
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
see
that
I
'll
have
to
be
very
careful
what
I
say
after
this
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
since
the
fine
feelings
of
orphans
,
brought
from
goodness
*NL*
knows
where
,
have
to
be
considered
before
anything
else
.
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
not
*NL*
vexed
--
do
n't
worry
yourself
.
I
'm
too
sorry
for
you
to
leave
any
room
for
*NL*
anger
in
my
mind
.
You
'll
have
your
own
troubles
with
that
child
.
But
*NL*
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
--
which
I
suppose
you
wo
n't
do
,
although
I
've
*NL*
brought
up
ten
children
and
buried
two
--
you
'll
do
that
`
talking
to
'
you
*NL*
mention
with
a
fair-sized
birch
switch
.
I
should
think
THAT
would
be
the
*NL*
most
effective
language
for
that
kind
of
a
child
.
Her
temper
matches
her
*NL*
hair
I
guess
.
Well
,
good
evening
,
Marilla
.
I
hope
you
'll
come
down
to
*NL*
see
me
often
as
usual
.
But
you
ca
n't
expect
me
to
visit
here
again
in
a
*NL*
hurry
,
if
I
'm
liable
to
be
flown
at
and
insulted
in
such
a
fashion
.
It
's
*NL*
something
new
in
MY
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereat
Mrs.
Rachel
swept
out
and
away
--
if
a
fat
woman
who
always
*NL*
waddled
COULD
be
said
to
sweep
away
--
and
Marilla
with
a
very
solemn
face
*NL*
betook
herself
to
the
east
gable
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
upstairs
she
pondered
uneasily
as
to
what
she
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
She
felt
no
little
dismay
over
the
scene
that
had
just
been
enacted
.
*NL*
How
unfortunate
that
Anne
should
have
displayed
such
temper
before
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
Lynde
,
of
all
people
!
Then
Marilla
suddenly
became
aware
of
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
and
rebuking
consciousness
that
she
felt
more
humiliation
*NL*
over
this
than
sorrow
over
the
discovery
of
such
a
serious
defect
*NL*
in
Anne
's
disposition
.
And
how
was
she
to
punish
her
?
The
amiable
*NL*
suggestion
of
the
birch
switch
--
to
the
efficiency
of
which
all
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
's
own
children
could
have
borne
smarting
testimony
--
did
not
*NL*
appeal
to
Marilla
.
She
did
not
believe
she
could
whip
a
child
.
No
,
*NL*
some
other
method
of
punishment
must
be
found
to
bring
Anne
to
a
proper
*NL*
realization
of
the
enormity
of
her
offense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
found
Anne
face
downward
on
her
bed
,
crying
bitterly
,
quite
*NL*
oblivious
of
muddy
boots
on
a
clean
counterpane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
she
said
not
ungently
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
with
greater
severity
,
``
get
off
that
bed
this
minute
and
listen
*NL*
to
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
squirmed
off
the
bed
and
sat
rigidly
on
a
chair
beside
it
,
her
face
*NL*
swollen
and
tear-stained
and
her
eyes
fixed
stubbornly
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
nice
way
for
you
to
behave
.
Anne
!
Are
n't
you
ashamed
of
*NL*
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
n't
any
right
to
call
me
ugly
and
redheaded
,
''
retorted
Anne
,
*NL*
evasive
and
defiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
n't
any
right
to
fly
into
such
a
fury
and
talk
the
way
you
did
*NL*
to
her
,
Anne
.
I
was
ashamed
of
you
--
thoroughly
ashamed
of
you
.
I
*NL*
wanted
you
to
behave
nicely
to
Mrs.
Lynde
,
and
instead
of
that
you
have
*NL*
disgraced
me
.
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
lose
your
temper
like
*NL*
that
just
because
Mrs.
Lynde
said
you
were
red-haired
and
homely
.
You
*NL*
say
it
yourself
often
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
there
's
such
a
difference
between
saying
a
thing
yourself
and
*NL*
hearing
other
people
say
it
,
''
wailed
Anne
.
``
You
may
know
a
thing
is
*NL*
so
,
but
you
ca
n't
help
hoping
other
people
do
n't
quite
think
it
is
.
I
*NL*
suppose
you
think
I
have
an
awful
temper
,
but
I
could
n't
help
it
.
When
*NL*
she
said
those
things
something
just
rose
right
up
in
me
and
choked
me
.
*NL*
I
HAD
to
fly
out
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
made
a
fine
exhibition
of
yourself
I
must
say

Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
will
have
a
nice
story
to
tell
about
you
everywhere
--
and
she
'll
tell
*NL*
it

too

It
was
a
dreadful
thing
for
you

lose
your
temper
like
that

*NL*
Anne

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just

your
face

skinny

ugly

pleaded
Anne
tearfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
remembrance
suddenly
rose
up
before
Marilla
.
She
had
been
a
very
*NL*
small
child
when
she
had
heard
one
aunt
say
of
her
to
another
,
``
What
a
*NL*
pity
she
is
such
a
dark
,
homely
little
thing
.
''
Marilla
was
every
day
of
*NL*
fifty
before
the
sting
had
gone
out
of
that
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
that
I
think
Mrs.
Lynde
was
exactly
right
in
saying
what
*NL*
she
did
to
you
,
Anne
,
''
she
admitted
in
a
softer
tone
.
``
Rachel
is
too
*NL*
outspoken
.
But
that
is
no
excuse
for
such
behavior
on
your
part

She
*NL*
was
a
stranger
and
an
elderly
person
and
my
visitor
--
all
three
very
good
*NL*
reasons
why
you
should
have
been
respectful
to
her
.
You
were
rude
and
*NL*
saucy
and
''
--
Marilla
had
a
saving
inspiration
of
punishment
--
``
you
must
go
*NL*
to
her
and
tell
her
you
are
very
sorry
for
your
bad
temper

ask
her
*NL*
to
forgive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
never
do
that

said
Anne
determinedly
and
darkly
.
``
You
can
*NL*
punish
me
in
any
way
you

You
can
shut
me
up
in

dark

*NL*
damp
dungeon
inhabited
by
snakes

toads
and
feed
me
only
on
bread

water

I
shall
not
complain

But
I

not
ask
Mrs.

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
in
the
habit

dark
damp
dungeons

*NL*
said
Marilla
drily
,
``
especially

apologize

mournfully

when
I
'm
*NL*
not
,
can
I
?
I
ca
n't
even
IMAGINE
I
'm
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
your
imagination
will
be
in
better
working
order
by
the
*NL*
morning
,
''
said
Marilla
,
rising
to
depart
.
``
You
'll
have
the
night
to
*NL*
think
over
your
conduct
in
and
come
to
a
better
frame
of
mind
.
You
said
*NL*
you
would
try
to
be
a
very
good
girl
if
we
kept
you
at
Green
Gables
,
but
*NL*
I
must
say
it
has
n't
seemed
very
much
like
it
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
this
Parthian
shaft
to
rankle
in
Anne
's
stormy
bosom
,
Marilla
*NL*
descended
to
the
kitchen
,
grievously
troubled
in
mind
and
vexed
in
*NL*
soul
.
She
was
as
angry
with
herself
as
with
Anne
,
because
,
whenever
she
*NL*
recalled
Mrs.
Rachel
's
dumbfounded
countenance
her
lips
twitched
with
*NL*
amusement
and
she
felt
a
most
reprehensible
desire
to
laugh
.

CHAPTER
X.
Anne
's
Apology
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
said
nothing
to
Matthew
about
the
affair
that
evening
;
but
when
*NL*
Anne
proved
still
refractory
the
next
morning
an
explanation
had
to
be
*NL*
made
to
account
for
her
absence
from
the
breakfast
table
.
Marilla
told
*NL*
Matthew
the
whole
story
,
taking
pains
to
impress
him
with
a
due
sense
of
*NL*
the
enormity
of
Anne
's
behavior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
thing
Rachel
Lynde
got
a
calling
down
;
she
's
a
meddlesome
*NL*
old
gossip
,
''
was
Matthew
's
consolatory
rejoinder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
I
'm
astonished
at
you
.
You
know
that
Anne
's
behavior
*NL*
was
dreadful
,
and
yet
you
take
her
part
!
I
suppose
you
'll
be
saying
next
*NL*
thing
that
she
ought
n't
to
be
punished
at
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
--
no
--
not
exactly
,
''
said
Matthew
uneasily
.
``
I
reckon
she
*NL*
ought
to
be
punished
a
little
.
But
do
n't
be
too
hard
on
her
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
Recollect
she
has
n't
ever
had
anyone
to
teach
her
right
.
You
're
--
you
're
*NL*
going
to
give
her
something
to
eat
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
ever
hear
of
me
starving
people
into
good
behavior
?
''
*NL*
demanded
Marilla
indignantly
.
``
She
'll
have
her
meals
regular
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
carry
them
up
to
her
myself
.
But
she
'll
stay
up
there
until
she
's
*NL*
willing
to
apologize
to
Mrs.
Lynde
,
and
that
's
final
,
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
,
dinner
,
and
supper
were
very
silent
meals
--
for
Anne
still
*NL*
remained
obdurate
.
After
each
meal
Marilla
carried
a
well-filled
tray
*NL*
to
the
east
gable
and
brought
it
down
later
on
not
noticeably
depleted
.
*NL*
Matthew
eyed
its
last
descent
with
a
troubled
eye
.
Had
Anne
eaten
*NL*
anything
at
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
went
out
that
evening
to
bring
the
cows
from
the
back
*NL*
pasture
,
Matthew
,
who
had
been
hanging
about
the
barns
and
watching
,
*NL*
slipped
into
the
house
with
the
air
of
a
burglar
and
crept
upstairs
.
As
*NL*
a
general
thing
Matthew
gravitated
between
the
kitchen
and
the
little
*NL*
bedroom
off
the
hall
where
he
slept
;
once
in
a
while
he
ventured
*NL*
uncomfortably
into
the
parlor
or
sitting
room
when
the
minister
came
to
*NL*
tea
.
But
he
had
never
been
upstairs
in
his
own
house
since
the
spring
he
*NL*
helped
Marilla
paper
the
spare
bedroom
,
and
that
was
four
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tiptoed
along
the
hall
and
stood
for
several
minutes
outside
the
*NL*
door
of
the
east
gable
before
he
summoned
courage
to
tap
on
it
with
his
*NL*
fingers
and
then
open
the
door
to
peep
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
sitting
on
the
yellow
chair
by
the
window
gazing
mournfully
out
*NL*
into
the
garden
.
Very
small
and
unhappy
she
looked
,
and
Matthew
's
heart
*NL*
smote
him
.
He
softly
closed
the
door
and
tiptoed
over
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
he
whispered
,
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
,
``
how
are
you
*NL*
making
it
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
smiled
wanly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
.
I
imagine
a
good
deal
,
and
that
helps
to
pass
the
time
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
it
's
rather
lonesome
.
But
then
,
I
may
as
well
get
used
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
smiled
again
,
bravely
facing
the
long
years
of
solitary
*NL*
imprisonment
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
recollected
that
he
must
say
what
he
had
come
to
say
without
*NL*
loss
of
time
,
lest
Marilla
return
prematurely
.
``
Well
now
,
Anne
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
think
you
'd
better
do
it
and
have
it
over
with
?
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
``
It
'll
have
to
be
done
sooner
or
later
,
you
know
,
for
Marilla
's
a
*NL*
dreadful
deter-mined
woman
--
dreadful
determined
,
Anne
.
Do
it
right
off
,
*NL*
I
say
,
and
have
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
apologize
to
Mrs.
Lynde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
apologize
--
that
's
the
very
word
,
''
said
Matthew
eagerly
.
``
Just
*NL*
smooth
it
over
so
to
speak
.
That
's
what
I
was
trying
to
get
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
could
do
it
to
oblige
you
,
''
said
Anne
thoughtfully
.
``
It
*NL*
would
be
true
enough
to
say
I
am
sorry
,
because
I
AM
sorry
now
.
I
was
n't
*NL*
a
bit
sorry
last
night
.
I
was
mad
clear
through
,
and
I
stayed
mad
all
*NL*
night
.
I
know
I
did
because
I
woke
up
three
times
and
I
was
just
*NL*
furious
every
time
.
But
this
morning
it
was
over
.
I
was
n't
in
a
temper
*NL*
anymore
--
and
it
left
a
dreadful
sort
of
goneness
,
too
.
I
felt
so
ashamed
*NL*
of
myself
.
But
I
just
could
n't
think
of
going
and
telling
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
so
.
It
would
be
so
humiliating
.
I
made
up
my
mind
I
'd
stay
shut
up
here
*NL*
forever
rather
than
do
that
.
But
still
--
I
'd
do
anything
for
you
--
if
you
*NL*
really
want
me
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
of
course
I
do
.
It
's
terrible
lonesome
downstairs
without
*NL*
you
.
Just
go
and
smooth
things
over
--
that
's
a
good
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Anne
resignedly
.
``
I
'll
tell
Marilla
as
soon
as
she
*NL*
comes
in
I
've
repented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
--
that
's
right
,
Anne
.
But
do
n't
tell
Marilla
I
said
*NL*
anything
about
it
.
She
might
think
I
was
putting
my
oar
in
and
I
*NL*
promised
not
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wild
horses
wo
n't
drag
the
secret
from
me
,
''
promised
Anne
solemnly
.
*NL*
``
How
would
wild
horses
drag
a
secret
from
a
person
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Matthew
was
gone
,
scared
at
his
own
success
.
He
fled
hastily
to
the
*NL*
remotest
corner
of
the
horse
pasture
lest
Marilla
should
suspect
what
*NL*
he
had
been
up
to
.
Marilla
herself
,
upon
her
return
to
the
house
,
was
*NL*
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
a
plaintive
voice
calling
,
``
Marilla
''
over
*NL*
the
banisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
she
said
,
going
into
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
I
lost
my
temper
and
said
rude
things
,
and
I
'm
willing
to
go
*NL*
and
tell
Mrs.
Lynde
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
Marilla
's
crispness
gave
no
sign
of
her
relief
.
She
had
*NL*
been
wondering
what
under
the
canopy
she
should
do
if
Anne
did
not
give
*NL*
in
.
``
I
'll
take
you
down
after
milking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
after
milking
,
behold
Marilla
and
Anne
walking
down
the
*NL*
lane
,
the
former
erect
and
triumphant
,
the
latter
drooping
and
dejected
.
*NL*
But
halfway
down
Anne
's
dejection
vanished
as
if
by
enchantment
.
She
*NL*
lifted
her
head
and
stepped
lightly
along
,
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
sunset
*NL*
sky
and
an
air
of
subdued
exhilaration
about
her
.
Marilla
beheld
the
*NL*
change
disapprovingly
.
This
was
no
meek
penitent
such
as
it
behooved
her
*NL*
to
take
into
the
presence
of
the
offended
Mrs.
Lynde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
Anne
?
''
she
asked
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
imagining
out
what
I
must
say
to
Mrs.
Lynde
,
''
answered
Anne
*NL*
dreamily
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
satisfactory
--
or
should
have
been
so
.
But
Marilla
could
not
*NL*
rid
herself
of
the
notion
that
something
in
her
scheme
of
punishment
was
*NL*
going
askew
.
Anne
had
no
business
to
look
so
rapt
and
radiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rapt
and
radiant
Anne
continued
until
they
were
in
the
very
presence
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Lynde
,
who
was
sitting
knitting
by
her
kitchen
window
.
Then
the
*NL*
radiance
vanished
.
Mournful
penitence
appeared
on
every
feature
.
Before
*NL*
a
word
was
spoken
Anne
suddenly
went
down
on
her
knees
before
the
*NL*
astonished
Mrs.
Rachel
and
held
out
her
hands
beseechingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Lynde
,
I
am
so
extremely
sorry
,
''
she
said
with
a
quiver
in
*NL*
her
voice
.
``
I
could
never
express
all
my
sorrow
,
no
,
not
if
I
used
up
*NL*
a
whole
dictionary
.
You
must
just
imagine
it
.
I
behaved
terribly
to
*NL*
you
--
and
I
've
disgraced
the
dear
friends
,
Matthew
and
Marilla
,
who
have
*NL*
let
me
stay
at
Green
Gables
although
I
'm
not
a
boy
.
I
'm
a
dreadfully
*NL*
wicked
and
ungrateful
girl
,
and
I
deserve
to
be
punished
and
cast
out
*NL*
by
respectable
people
forever
.
It
was
very
wicked
of
me
to
fly
into
a
*NL*
temper
because
you
told
me
the
truth
.
It
WAS
the
truth
;
every
word
you
*NL*
said
was
true
.
My
hair
is
red
and
I
'm
freckled
and
skinny
and
ugly
.
*NL*
What
I
said
to
you
was
true
,
too
,
but
I
should
n't
have
said
it
.
Oh
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
,
please
,
please
,
forgive
me
.
If
you
refuse
it
will
be
a
lifelong
*NL*
sorrow
on
a
poor
little
orphan
girl
,
would
you
,
even
if
she
had
a
*NL*
dreadful
temper
?
Oh
,
I
am
sure
you
would
n't
.
Please
say
you
forgive
me
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
clasped
her
hands
together
,
bowed
her
head
,
and
waited
for
the
word
*NL*
of
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
mistaking
her
sincerity
--
it
breathed
in
every
tone
of
her
*NL*
voice
.
Both
Marilla
and
Mrs.
Lynde
recognized
its
unmistakable
ring
.
*NL*
But
the
former
under-stood
in
dismay
that
Anne
was
actually
enjoying
*NL*
her
valley
of
humiliation
--
was
reveling
in
the
thoroughness
of
her
*NL*
abasement
.
Where
was
the
wholesome
punishment
upon
which
she
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
had
plumed
herself
?
Anne
had
turned
it
into
a
species
of
positive
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
Mrs.
Lynde
,
not
being
overburdened
with
perception
,
did
not
see
*NL*
this
.
She
only
perceived
that
Anne
had
made
a
very
thorough
apology
and
*NL*
all
resentment
vanished
from
her
kindly
,
if
somewhat
officious
,
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
get
up
,
child
,
''
she
said
heartily
.
``
Of
course
I
forgive
*NL*
you
.
I
guess
I
was
a
little
too
hard
on
you
,
anyway
.
But
I
'm
such
an
*NL*
outspoken
person
.
You
just
must
n't
mind
me
,
that
's
what
.
It
ca
n't
be
*NL*
denied
your
hair
is
terrible
red
;
but
I
knew
a
girl
once
--
went
to
school
*NL*
with
her
,
in
fact
--
whose
hair
was
every
mite
as
red
as
yours
when
she
*NL*
was
young
,
but
when
she
grew
up
it
darkened
to
a
real
handsome
auburn
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
be
a
mite
surprised
if
yours
did
,
too
--
not
a
mite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Lynde
!
''
Anne
drew
a
long
breath
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
.
``
You
*NL*
have
given
me
a
hope
.
I
shall
always
feel
that
you
are
a
benefactor

Oh
,
*NL*
I
could
endure
anything
if
I
only
thought
my
hair
would
be
a
handsome
*NL*
auburn
when
I
grew
up
.
It
would
be
so
much
easier
to
be
good
if
one
's
*NL*
hair
was
a
handsome
auburn
,
do
n't
you
think
?
And
now
may
I
go
out
into
*NL*
your
garden
and
sit
on
that
bench
under
the
apple-trees
while
you
and
*NL*
Marilla
are
talking
?
There
is
so
much
more
scope
for
imagination
out
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laws
,
yes
,
run
along
,
child
.
And
you
can
pick
a
bouquet
of
them
white
*NL*
June
lilies
over
in
the
corner
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
door
closed
behind
Anne
Mrs.
Lynde
got
briskly
up
to
light
a
*NL*
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
real
odd
little
thing
.
Take
this
chair
,
Marilla
;
it
's
easier
*NL*
than
the
one
you
've
got
;
I
just
keep
that
for
the
hired
boy
to
sit
*NL*
on
.
Yes
,
she
certainly
is
an
odd
child
,
but
there
is
something
kind
of
*NL*
taking
about
her
after
all
.
I
do
n't
feel
so
surprised
at
you
and
Matthew
*NL*
keeping
her
as
I
did
--
nor
so
sorry
for
you
,
either
.
She
may
turn
out
all
*NL*
right
.
Of
course
,
she
has
a
queer
way
of
expressing
herself
--
a
little
*NL*
too
--
well
,
too
kind
of
forcible
,
you
know
;
but
she
'll
likely
get
over
*NL*
that
now
that
she
's
come
to
live
among
civilized
folks
.
And
then
,
her
*NL*
temper
's
pretty
quick
,
I
guess
;
but
there
's
one
comfort
,
a
child
that
*NL*
has
a
quick
temper
,
just
blaze
up
and
cool
down
,
ai
n't
never
likely
to
*NL*
be
sly
or
deceitful
.
Preserve
me
from
a
sly
child
,
that
's
what
.
On
the
*NL*
whole
,
Marilla
,
I
kind
of
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
went
home
Anne
came
out
of
the
fragrant
twilight
of
the
*NL*
orchard
with
a
sheaf
of
white
narcissi
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
apologized
pretty
well
,
did
n't
I
?
''
she
said
proudly
as
they
went
*NL*
down
the
lane
.
``
I
thought
since
I
had
to
do
it
I
might
as
well
do
it
*NL*
thoroughly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
it
thoroughly
,
all
right
enough
,
''
was
Marilla
's
comment
.
*NL*
Marilla
was
dismayed
at
finding
herself
inclined
to
laugh
over
the
*NL*
recollection
.
She
had
also
an
uneasy
feeling
that
she
ought
to
scold
*NL*
Anne
for
apologizing
so
well
;
but
then
,
that
was
ridiculous
!
She
*NL*
compromised
with
her
conscience
by
saying
severely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
wo
n't
have
occasion
to
make
many
more
such
apologies
.
I
hope
*NL*
you
'll
try
to
control
your
temper
now
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
n't
be
so
hard
if
people
would
n't
twit
me
about
my
looks
,
''
*NL*
said
Anne
with
a
sigh
.
``
I
do
n't
get
cross
about
other
things
;
but
I
'm
*NL*
SO
tired
of
being
twitted
about
my
hair
and
it
just
makes
me
boil
right
*NL*
over
.
Do
you
suppose
my
hair
will
really
be
a
handsome
auburn
when
I
*NL*
grow
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
think
so
much
about
your
looks
,
Anne
.
I
'm
afraid
you
are
*NL*
a
very
vain
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
be
vain
when
I
know
I
'm
homely
?
''
protested
Anne
.
``
I
love
*NL*
pretty
things
;
and
I
hate
to
look
in
the
glass
and
see
something
that
*NL*
is
n't
pretty
.
It
makes
me
feel
so
sorrowful
--
just
as
I
feel
when
I
look
*NL*
at
any
ugly
thing
.
I
pity
it
because
it
is
n't
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
is
as
handsome
does
,
''
quoted
Marilla
.
``
I
've
had
that
said
*NL*
to
me
before
,
but
I
have
my
doubts
about
it
,
''
remarked
skeptical
Anne
,
*NL*
sniffing
at
her
narcissi
.
``
Oh
,
are
n't
these
flowers
sweet
!
It
was
lovely
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Lynde
to
give
them
to
me
.
I
have
no
hard
feelings
against
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
now
.
It
gives
you
a
lovely
,
comfortable
feeling
to
apologize
and
*NL*
be
forgiven
,
does
n't
it
?
Are
n't
the
stars
bright
tonight
?
If
you
could
*NL*
live
in
a
star
,
which
one
would
you
pick
?
I
'd
like
that
lovely
clear
big
*NL*
one
away
over
there
above
that
dark
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
do
hold
your
tongue
,
''
said
Marilla
,
thoroughly
worn
out
trying
to
*NL*
follow
the
gyrations
of
Anne
's
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
said
no
more
until
they
turned
into
their
own
lane
.
A
little
gypsy
*NL*
wind
came
down
it
to
meet
them
,
laden
with
the
spicy
perfume
of
young
*NL*
dew-wet
ferns
.
Far
up
in
the
shadows
a
cheerful
light
gleamed
out
*NL*
through
the
trees
from
the
kitchen
at
Green
Gables
.
Anne
suddenly
came
*NL*
close
to
Marilla
and
slipped
her
hand
into
the
older
woman
's
hard
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
lovely
to
be
going
home
and
know
it
's
home
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
love
*NL*
Green
Gables
already
,
and
I
never
loved
any
place
before
.
No
place
ever
*NL*
seemed
like
home
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
'm
so
happy
.
I
could
pray
right
now
and
*NL*
not
find
it
a
bit
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
warm
and
pleasant
welled
up
in
Marilla
's
heart
at
touch
of
*NL*
that
thin
little
hand
in
her
own
--
a
throb
of
the
maternity
she
had
*NL*
missed
,
perhaps
.
Its
very
unaccustomedness
and
sweetness
disturbed
*NL*
her
.
She
hastened
to
restore
her
sensations
to
their
normal
calm
by
*NL*
inculcating
a
moral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
be
a
good
girl
you
'll
always
be
happy
,
Anne
.
And
you
should
*NL*
never
find
it
hard
to
say
your
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saying
one
's
prayers
is
n't
exactly
the
same
thing
as
praying
,
''
said
*NL*
Anne
meditatively
.
``
But
I
'm
going
to
imagine
that
I
'm
the
wind
that
is
*NL*
blowing
up
there
in
those
tree
tops
.
When
I
get
tired
of
the
trees
I
'll
*NL*
imagine
I
'm
gently
waving
down
here
in
the
ferns
--
and
then
I
'll
fly
over
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Lynde
's
garden
and
set
the
flowers
dancing
--
and
then
I
'll
go
*NL*
with
one
great
swoop
over
the
clover
field
--
and
then
I
'll
blow
over
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
and
ripple
it
all
up
into
little
sparkling
waves
.
*NL*
Oh
,
there
's
so
much
scope
for
imagination
in
a
wind
!
So
I
'll
not
talk
*NL*
any
more
just
now
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
be
to
goodness
for
that
,
''
breathed
Marilla
in
devout
relief

CHAPTER
XI
.
Anne
's
Impressions
of
Sunday-School
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
do
you
like
them
?
''
said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
standing
in
the
gable
room
,
looking
solemnly
at
three
new
*NL*
dresses
spread
out
on
the
bed
.
One
was
of
snuffy
colored
gingham
which
*NL*
Marilla
had
been
tempted
to
buy
from
a
peddler
the
preceding
summer
*NL*
because
it
looked
so
serviceable
;
one
was
of
black-and-white
checkered
*NL*
sateen
which
she
had
picked
up
at
a
bargain
counter
in
the
winter
;
and
*NL*
one
was
a
stiff
print
of
an
ugly
blue
shade
which
she
had
purchased
that
*NL*
week
at
a
Carmody
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
them
up
herself
,
and
they
were
all
made
alike
--
plain
skirts
*NL*
fulled
tightly
to
plain
waists
,
with
sleeves
as
plain
as
waist
and
skirt
*NL*
and
tight
as
sleeves
could
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
imagine
that
I
like
them
,
''
said
Anne
soberly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
imagine
it
,
''
said
Marilla
,
offended
.
``
Oh
,
I
can
see
*NL*
you
do
n't
like
the
dresses
!
What
is
the
matter
with
them
?
Are
n't
they
*NL*
neat
and
clean
and
new
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
like
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
--
they
're
not
--
pretty
,
''
said
Anne
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
!
''
Marilla
sniffed
.
``
I
did
n't
trouble
my
head
about
getting
*NL*
pretty
dresses
for
you
.
I
do
n't
believe
in
pampering
vanity
,
Anne
,
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
that
right
off
.
Those
dresses
are
good
,
sensible
,
serviceable
*NL*
dresses
,
without
any
frills
or
furbelows
about
them
,
and
they
're
all
*NL*
you
'll
get
this
summer
.
The
brown
gingham
and
the
blue
print
will
do
*NL*
you
for
school
when
you
begin
to
go
.
The
sateen
is
for
church
and
Sunday
*NL*
school
.
I
'll
expect
you
to
keep
them
neat
and
clean
and
not
to
tear
*NL*
them
.
I
should
think
you
'd
be
grateful
to
get
most
anything
after
those
*NL*
skimpy
wincey
things
you
've
been
wearing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
AM
grateful
,
''
protested
Anne
.
``
But
I
'd
be
ever
so
much
*NL*
gratefuller
if
--
if
you
'd
made
just
one
of
them
with
puffed
sleeves
.
*NL*
Puffed
sleeves
are
so
fashionable
now
.
It
would
give
me
such
a
thrill
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
just
to
wear
a
dress
with
puffed
sleeves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
have
to
do
without
your
thrill
.
I
had
n't
any
material
*NL*
to
waste
on
puffed
sleeves
.
I
think
they
are
ridiculous-looking
things
*NL*
anyhow
.
I
prefer
the
plain
,
sensible
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'd
rather
look
ridiculous
when
everybody
else
does
than
plain
and
*NL*
sensible
all
by
myself
,
''
persisted
Anne
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trust
you
for
that
!
Well
,
hang
those
dresses
carefully
up
in
your
*NL*
closet
,
and
then
sit
down
and
learn
the
Sunday
school
lesson
.
I
got
*NL*
a
quarterly
from
Mr.
Bell
for
you
and
you
'll
go
to
Sunday
school
*NL*
tomorrow
,
''
said
Marilla
,
disappearing
downstairs
in
high
dudgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
at
the
dresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
hope
there
would
be
a
white
one
with
puffed
sleeves
,
''
she
*NL*
whispered
disconsolately
.
``
I
prayed
for
one
,
but
I
did
n't
much
expect
it
*NL*
on
that
account
.
I
did
n't
suppose
God
would
have
time
to
bother
about
*NL*
a
little
orphan
girl
's
dress
.
I
knew
I
'd
just
have
to
depend
on
*NL*
Marilla
for
it
.
Well
,
fortunately
I
can
imagine
that
one
of
them
is
of
*NL*
snow-white
muslin
with
lovely
lace
frills
and
three-puffed
sleeves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
warnings
of
a
sick
headache
prevented
Marilla
from
*NL*
going
to
Sunday-school
with
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
go
down
and
call
for
Mrs.
Lynde
,
Anne
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
She
'll
see
that
you
get
into
the
right
class
.
Now
,
mind
you
behave
*NL*
yourself
properly
.
Stay
to
preaching
afterwards
and
ask
Mrs.
Lynde
to
*NL*
show
you
our
pew
.
Here
's
a
cent
for
collection
.
Do
n't
stare
at
people
*NL*
and
do
n't
fidget
.
I
shall
expect
you
to
tell
me
the
text
when
you
come
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
started
off
irreproachable
,
arrayed
in
the
stiff
black-and-white
*NL*
sateen
,
which
,
while
decent
as
regards
length
and
certainly
not
open
to
*NL*
the
charge
of
skimpiness
,
contrived
to
emphasize
every
corner
and
angle
*NL*
of
her
thin
figure
.
Her
hat
was
a
little
,
flat
,
glossy
,
new
sailor
,
the
*NL*
extreme
plainness
of
which
had
likewise
much
disappointed
Anne
,
who
*NL*
had
permitted
herself
secret
visions
of
ribbon
and
flowers
.
The
latter
,
*NL*
however
,
were
supplied
before
Anne
reached
the
main
road
,
for
being
*NL*
confronted
halfway
down
the
lane
with
a
golden
frenzy
of
wind-stirred
*NL*
buttercups
and
a
glory
of
wild
roses
,
Anne
promptly
and
liberally
*NL*
garlanded
her
hat
with
a
heavy
wreath
of
them
.
Whatever
other
people
*NL*
might
have
thought
of
the
result
it
satisfied
Anne
,
and
she
tripped
*NL*
gaily
down
the
road
,
holding
her
ruddy
head
with
its
decoration
of
pink
*NL*
and
yellow
very
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
reached
Mrs.
Lynde
's
house
she
found
that
lady
gone
.
*NL*
Nothing
daunted
,
Anne
proceeded
onward
to
the
church
alone
.
In
the
porch
*NL*
she
found
a
crowd
of
little
girls
,
all
more
or
less
gaily
attired
in
*NL*
whites
and
blues
and
pinks
,
and
all
staring
with
curious
eyes
at
this
*NL*
stranger
in
their
midst
,
with
her
extraordinary
head
adornment
.
Avonlea
*NL*
little
girls
had
already
heard
queer
stories
about
Anne
.
Mrs.
Lynde
said
*NL*
she
had
an
awful
temper
;
Jerry
Buote
,
the
hired
boy
at
Green
Gables
,
*NL*
said
she
talked
all
the
time
to
herself
or
to
the
trees
and
flowers
*NL*
like
a
crazy
girl
.
They
looked
at
her
and
whispered
to
each
other
behind
*NL*
their
quarterlies
.
Nobody
made
any
friendly
advances
,
then
or
later
*NL*
on
when
the
opening
exercises
were
over
and
Anne
found
herself
in
Miss
*NL*
Rogerson
's
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Rogerson
was
a
middle-aged
lady
who
had
taught
a
Sunday-school
*NL*
class
for
twenty
years
.
Her
method
of
teaching
was
to
ask
the
printed
*NL*
questions
from
the
quarterly
and
look
sternly
over
its
edge
at
the
*NL*
particular
little
girl
she
thought
ought
to
answer
the
question
.
She
*NL*
looked
very
often
at
Anne
,
and
Anne
,
thanks
to
Marilla
's
drilling
,
*NL*
answered
promptly
;
but
it
may
be
questioned
if
she
understood
very
much
*NL*
about
either
question
or
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
think
she
liked
Miss
Rogerson
,
and
she
felt
very
miserable
;
*NL*
every
other
little
girl
in
the
class
had
puffed
sleeves
.
Anne
felt
that
*NL*
life
was
really
not
worth
living
without
puffed
sleeves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
did
you
like
Sunday
school
?
''
Marilla
wanted
to
know
when
Anne
*NL*
came
home
.
Her
wreath
having
faded
,
Anne
had
discarded
it
in
the
lane
,
*NL*
so
Marilla
was
spared
the
knowledge
of
that
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
like
it
a
bit
.
It
was
horrid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
!
''
said
Marilla
rebukingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sat
down
on
the
rocker
with
a
long
sigh
,
kissed
one
of
Bonny
's
*NL*
leaves
,
and
waved
her
hand
to
a
blossoming
fuchsia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
might
have
been
lonesome
while
I
was
away
,
''
she
explained
.
``
And
*NL*
now
about
the
Sunday
school
.
I
behaved
well
,
just
as
you
told
me
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
was
gone
,
but
I
went
right
on
myself
.
I
went
into
the
church
,
with
*NL*
a
lot
of
other
little
girls
,
and
I
sat
in
the
corner
of
a
pew
by
the
*NL*
window
while
the
opening
exercises
went
on
.
Mr.
Bell
made
an
awfully
*NL*
long
prayer
.
I
would
have
been
dreadfully
tired
before
he
got
through
*NL*
if
I
had
n't
been
sitting
by
that
window
.
But
it
looked
right
out
on
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
,
so
I
just
gazed
at
that
and
imagined
all
sorts
*NL*
of
splendid
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
done
anything
of
the
sort
.
You
should
have
listened
*NL*
to
Mr.
Bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
was
n't
talking
to
me
,
''
protested
Anne
.
``
He
was
talking
to
God
*NL*
and
he
did
n't
seem
to
be
very
much
inter-ested
in
it
,
either
.
I
think
*NL*
he
thought
God
was
too
far
off
though
.
There
was
a
long
row
of
white
*NL*
birches
hanging
over
the
lake
and
the
sunshine
fell
down
through
*NL*
them
,
`
way
,
`
way
down
,
deep
into
the
water
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
was
like
a
*NL*
beautiful
dream
!
It
gave
me
a
thrill
and
I
just
said
,
`
Thank
you
for
it
,
*NL*
God
,
'
two
or
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
out
loud
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Marilla
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
just
under
my
breath
.
Well
,
Mr.
Bell
did
get
through
at
last
*NL*
and
they
told
me
to
go
into
the
classroom
with
Miss
Rogerson
's
class
.
*NL*
There
were
nine
other
girls
in
it
.
They
all
had
puffed
sleeves
.
I
tried
*NL*
to
imagine
mine
were
puffed
,
too
,
but
I
could
n't
.
Why
could
n't
I
?
It
was
*NL*
as
easy
as
could
be
to
imagine
they
were
puffed
when
I
was
alone
in
*NL*
the
east
gable
,
but
it
was
awfully
hard
there
among
the
others
who
had
*NL*
really
truly
puffs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
been
thinking
about
your
sleeves
in
Sunday
school
.
*NL*
You
should
have
been
attending
to
the
lesson
.
I
hope
you
knew
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
and
I
answered
a
lot
of
questions
.
Miss
Rogerson
asked
ever
so
*NL*
many
.
I
do
n't
think
it
was
fair
for
her
to
do
all
the
asking
.
There
were
*NL*
lots
I
wanted
to
ask
her
,
but
I
did
n't
like
to
because
I
did
n't
think
*NL*
she
was
a
kindred
spirit
.
Then
all
the
other
little
girls
recited
a
*NL*
paraphrase
.
She
asked
me
if
I
knew
any
.
I
told
her
I
did
n't
,
but
I
could
*NL*
recite
,
`
The
Dog
at
His
Master
's
Grave
'
if
she
liked
.
That
's
in
the
*NL*
Third
Royal
Reader
.
It
is
n't
a
really
truly
religious
piece
of
poetry
,
*NL*
but
it
's
so
sad
and
melancholy
that
it
might
as
well
be
.
She
said
it
*NL*
would
n't
do
and
she
told
me
to
learn
the
nineteenth
paraphrase
for
next
*NL*
Sunday
.
I
read
it
over
in
church
afterwards
and
it
's
splendid
.
There
are
*NL*
two
lines
in
particular
that
just
thrill
me
.

''

Quick

slaughtered

In

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
`
squadrons
'
means
nor
`
Midian
,
'
either
,
but
it
sounds
*NL*
SO
tragical
.
I
can
hardly
wait
until
next
Sunday
to
recite
it
.
*NL*
I
'll
practice
it
all
the
week
.
After
Sunday
school
I
asked
Miss
*NL*
Rogerson
--
because
Mrs.
Lynde
was
too
far
away
--
to
show
me
your
pew
.
*NL*
I
sat
just
as
still
as
I
could
and
the
text
was
Revelations
,
third
*NL*
chapter
,
second
and
third
verses
.
It
was
a
very
long
text
.
If
I
was
a
*NL*
minister
I
'd
pick
the
short
,
snappy
ones
.
The
sermon
was
awfully
long
,
*NL*
too
.
I
suppose
the
minister
had
to
match
it
to
the
text
.
I
did
n't
think
*NL*
he
was
a
bit
interesting
.
The
trouble
with
him
seems
to
be
that
he
*NL*
has
n't
enough
imagination
.
I
did
n't
listen
to
him
very
much
.
I
just
let
*NL*
my
thoughts
run
and
I
thought
of
the
most
surprising
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
felt
helplessly
that
all
this
should
be
sternly
reproved
,
but
*NL*
she
was
hampered
by
the
undeniable
fact
that
some
of
the
things
Anne
had
*NL*
said
,
especially
about
the
minister
's
sermons
and
Mr.
Bell
's
prayers
,
*NL*
were
what
she
herself
had
really
thought
deep
down
in
her
heart
for
*NL*
years
,
but
had
never
given
expression
to
.
It
almost
seemed
to
her
that
*NL*
those
secret
,
unuttered
,
critical
thoughts
had
suddenly
taken
visible
*NL*
and
accusing
shape
and
form
in
the
person
of
this
outspoken
morsel
of
*NL*
neglected
humanity

A
Solemn
Vow

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
until
the
next
Friday
that
Marilla
heard
the
story
of
the
*NL*
flower-wreathed
hat
.
She
came
home
from
Mrs.
Lynde
's
and
called
Anne
to
*NL*
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
Mrs.
Rachel
says
you
went
to
church
last
Sunday
with
your
hat
*NL*
rigged
out
ridiculous
with
roses
and
buttercups
.
What
on
earth
put
you
*NL*
up
to
such
a
caper
?
A
pretty-looking
object
you
must
have
been
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
I
know
pink
and
yellow
are
n't
becoming
to
me
,
''
began
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becoming
fiddlesticks
!
It
was
putting
flowers
on
your
hat
at
all
,
*NL*
no
matter
what
color
they
were
,
that
was
ridiculous
.
You
are
the
most
*NL*
aggravating
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
it
's
any
more
ridiculous
to
wear
flowers
on
your
hat
*NL*
than
on
your
dress
,
''
protested
Anne
.
``
Lots
of
little
girls
there
had
*NL*
bouquets
pinned
on
their
dresses
.
What
's
the
difference
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
was
not
to
be
drawn
from
the
safe
concrete
into
dubious
paths
of
*NL*
the
abstract
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
answer
me
back
like
that
,
Anne
.
It
was
very
silly
of
you
to
do
*NL*
such
a
thing
.
Never
let
me
catch
you
at
such
a
trick
again
.
Mrs.
Rachel
*NL*
says
she
thought
she
would
sink
through
the
floor
when
she
saw
you
come
*NL*
in
all
rigged
out
like
that
.
She
could
n't
get
near
enough
to
tell
you
*NL*
to
take
them
off
till
it
was
too
late
.
She
says
people
talked
about
it
*NL*
something
dreadful
.
Of
course
they
would
think
I
had
no
better
sense
*NL*
than
to
let
you
go
decked
out
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
said
Anne
,
tears
welling
into
her
eyes
.
``
I
never
*NL*
thought
you
'd
mind

The
roses
and
buttercups
were
so
sweet
and
pretty
*NL*
I
thought
they
'd
look
lovely
on
my
hat
.
Lots
of
the
little
girls
had
*NL*
artificial
flowers
on
their
hats
.
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
going
to
be
a
dreadful
*NL*
trial
to
you
.
Maybe
you
'd
better
send
me
back
to
the
asylum
.
That
would
*NL*
be
terrible
;
I
do
n't
think
I
could
endure
it
;
most
likely
I
would
go
*NL*
into
consumption
;
I
'm
so
thin
as
it
is
,
you
see
.
But
that
would
be
*NL*
better
than
being
a
trial
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
said
Marilla
,
vexed
at
herself
for
having
made
the
child
*NL*
cry
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
send
you
back
to
the
asylum

I
'm
sure

All
I
want

is
that
you
should
behave
like
other
little
girls
and
not
make
yourself
*NL*
ridiculous

Do
n't
cry
any
more
.
I
've
got
some
news
for
you

Diana
Barry
*NL*
came
home
this
afternoon
.
I
'm
going
up
to
see
if
I
can
borrow
a
skirt
*NL*
pattern
from
Mrs.
Barry
,
and
if
you
like
you
can
come
with
me
and
get
*NL*
acquainted
with
Diana
.

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
rose
to
her
feet
,
with
clasped
hands
,
the
tears
still
glistening
on
*NL*
her
cheeks
;
the
dish
towel
she
had
been
hemming
slipped
unheeded
to
the
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
'm
frightened
--
now
that
it
has
come
I
'm
actually
*NL*
frightened

What
if
she
should
n't
like
me
!
It
would
be
the
most
tragical
*NL*
disappointment
of
my
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

do
n't
get
into
a
fluster

And
I
do
wish
you
would
n't
use
such
long

words
.
It
sounds
so
funny
in
a
little
girl
.
I
guess
Diana
'll
like
you
*NL*
well
enough

It
's
her
mother

got
to
reckon
with

If
she
does

Diana
does

heard
about

your
outburst

Mrs.

going
to
church
with
buttercups
round
*NL*
your
hat
I
do
n't
know
what
she
'll
think
of
you

You
must
be
polite
and
*NL*
well
behaved

and
do
n't
make
any
of
your
startling
speeches

For
pity
's
*NL*
sake
,
if
the
child
is

actually
trembling

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
WAS
trembling

Her
face
was
pale
and
tense

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Marilla

you
'd
be
excited

too

girl

hoped

said
as
she
hastened
to
get
her
hat

*NL*
They
went
over
to
Orchard
Slope
by
the
short
cut
across
the
brook
and
up
*NL*
the
firry
hill
grove

Mrs.
Barry
came
to
the
kitchen
door
in
answer
to
*NL*
Marilla
's
knock
.
She
was
a
tall
black-eyed
,
black-haired
woman
,
with
a
*NL*
very
resolute
mouth
.
She
had
the
reputation
of
being
very
strict
with
*NL*
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do

Marilla
?

she
said
cordially

Come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spelled
with
an
E

gasped
Anne
,
who
,
tremulous
and
excited
as
she
was
,
*NL*
was
determined
there
should
be
no
misunderstanding
on
that
important
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Barry
,
not
hearing
or
not
comprehending
,
merely
shook
hands
and
*NL*
said
kindly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
well
in
body

considerable
rumpled
up

ma'am

said
Anne
gravely
.
Then
aside
to
Marilla
in
an
audible
whisper
,
*NL*
``
There
was
n't
anything
startling
in
that

was
there

*NL*
*NL*
Diana
was
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
reading
a
book
which
she
dropped
when
the
*NL*
callers
entered
.
She
was
a
very
pretty
little
girl
,
with
her
mother
's
*NL*
black
eyes
and
hair
,
and
rosy
cheeks

and
the
merry
expression

was

her
inheritance
from
her
father
.

*NL*
``
This

my
little

said
Mrs.
Barry
.
``
Diana
,
you
might
take
*NL*
Anne
out
into

garden

show
her
your

It

for
you

straining
your
eyes
over

book

She
reads
entirely

too
much

this
to
Marilla

the
little

went
out
--
``

I

always
poring
over

a

I
'm
glad
she
has
the
prospect
of
a
playmate
--
perhaps
it
will
*NL*
take
her
more
out-of-doors

*NL*
Outside
in
the
garden
,
which
was
full
of
mellow
sunset
light
streaming
*NL*
through
the
dark
old
firs
to
the
west
of
it
,
stood
Anne
and
Diana
,
*NL*
gazing
bashfully
at
each
other
over
a
clump
of
gorgeous
tiger
lilies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Barry
garden
was
a
bowery
wilderness
of
flowers
which
would
have
*NL*
delighted
Anne
's
heart
at
any
time
less
fraught
with
destiny
.
It
was
*NL*
encircled
by
huge
old
willows
and
tall
firs
,
beneath
which
flourished
*NL*
flowers
that
loved
the
shade
.
Prim
,
right-angled
paths
neatly
bordered
*NL*
with
clamshells
,
intersected
it
like
moist
red
ribbons
and
in
the
beds
*NL*
between
old-fashioned
flowers
ran
riot
.
There
were
rosy
bleeding-hearts
*NL*
and
great
splendid
crimson
peonies
;
white
,
fragrant
narcissi
and
thorny
,
*NL*
sweet
Scotch
roses
;
pink
and
blue
and
white
columbines
and
lilac-tinted
*NL*
Bouncing
Bets
;
clumps
of
southernwood
and
ribbon
grass
and
mint
;
purple
*NL*
Adam-and-Eve
,
daffodils
,
and
masses
of
sweet
clover
white
with
its
*NL*
delicate
,
fragrant
,
feathery
sprays
;
scarlet
lightning
that
shot
*NL*
its
fiery
lances
over
prim
white
musk-flowers
;
a
garden
it
was
where
*NL*
sunshine
lingered
and
bees
hummed
,
and
winds
,
beguiled
into
loitering
,
*NL*
purred
and
rustled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Diana
,
''
said
Anne
at
last
,
clasping
her
hands
and
speaking
almost
*NL*
in
a
whisper
,
``
oh

do
you
think

can
like
me
a
little

enough

*NL*
*NL*
Diana
laughed
.
Diana
always
laughed
before
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
guess
so

she
said
frankly

no
,
not
my
kind
of
swearing
.
There
are
two
kinds
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
heard
of
but
one
kind
,
''
said
Diana
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
really
is
another
.
Oh
,
it
is
n't
wicked
at
all
.
It
just
means
*NL*
vowing
and
promising
solemnly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
mind
doing
that
,
''
agreed
Diana
,
relieved
.
``
How
do
you
do
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
join
hands
--
so
,
''
said
Anne
gravely
.
``
It
ought
to
be
over
*NL*
running
water
.
We
'll
just
imagine
this
path
is
running
water
.
I
'll
*NL*
repeat
the
oath
first
.
I
solemnly
swear
to
be
faithful
to
my
bosom
*NL*
friend
,
Diana
Barry
,
as
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
shall
endure
.
Now
you
*NL*
say
it
and
put
my
name
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
repeated
the
``
oath
''
with
a
laugh
fore
and
aft
.
Then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
queer
girl
,
Anne
.
I
heard
before
that
you
were
queer
.
But
I
*NL*
believe
I
'm
going
to
like
you
real
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
and
Anne
went
home
Diana
went
with
them
as
far
as
the
log
*NL*
bridge
.
The
two
little
girls
walked
with
their
arms
about
each
other
.
*NL*
At
the
brook
they
parted
with
many
promises
to
spend
the
next
afternoon
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
find
Diana
a
kindred
spirit
?
''
asked
Marilla
as
they
went
*NL*
up
through
the
garden
of
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
sighed
Anne
,
blissfully
unconscious
of
any
sarcasm
on
*NL*
Marilla
's
part
.
``
Oh
Marilla
,
I
'm
the
happiest
girl
on
Prince
Edward
*NL*
Island
this
very
moment
.
I
assure
you
I
'll
say
my
prayers
with
a
right
*NL*
good-will
tonight
.
Diana
and
I
are
going
to
build
a
playhouse
in
Mr.
*NL*
William
Bell
's
birch
grove
tomorrow
.
Can
I
have
those
broken
pieces
of
*NL*
china
that
are
out
in
the
woodshed
?
Diana
's
birthday
is
in
February
and
*NL*
mine
is
in
March
.
Do
n't
you
think
that
is
a
very
strange
coincidence
?
*NL*
Diana
is
going
to
lend
me
a
book
to
read
.
She
says
it
's
perfectly
*NL*
splendid
and
tremendously
exciting
.
She
's
going
to
show
me
a
place
back
*NL*
in
the
woods
where
rice
lilies
grow
.
Do
n't
you
think
Diana
has
got
very
*NL*
soulful
eyes
?
I
wish
I
had
soulful
eyes
.
Diana
is
going
to
teach
me
to
*NL*
sing
a
song
called
`
Nelly
in
the
Hazel
Dell
.
'
She
's
going
to
give
me
a
*NL*
picture
to
put
up
in
my
room
;
it
's
a
perfectly
beautiful
picture
,
she
*NL*
says
--
a
lovely
lady
in
a
pale
blue
silk
dress
.
A
sewing-machine
agent
*NL*
gave
it
to
her
.
I
wish
I
had
something
to
give
Diana
.
I
'm
an
inch
taller
*NL*
than
Diana
,
but
she
is
ever
so
much
fatter
;
she
says
she
'd
like
to
be
*NL*
thin
because
it
's
so
much
more
graceful
,
but
I
'm
afraid
she
only
said
*NL*
it
to
soothe
my
feelings
.
We
're
going
to
the
shore
some
day
to
gather
*NL*
shells
.
We
have
agreed
to
call
the
spring
down
by
the
log
bridge
the
*NL*
Dryad
's
Bubble
.
Is
n't
that
a
perfectly
elegant
name
?
I
read
a
story
*NL*
once
about
a
spring
called
that
.
A
dryad
is
sort
of
a
grown-up
fairy
,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
I
hope
is
you
wo
n't
talk
Diana
to
death
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
But
*NL*
remember
this
in
all
your
planning
,
Anne
.
You
're
not
going
to
play
all
*NL*
the
time
nor
most
of
it
.
You
'll
have
your
work
to
do
and
it
'll
have
to
*NL*
be
done
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
cup
of
happiness
was
full
,
and
Matthew
caused
it
to
overflow
.
He
*NL*
had
just
got
home
from
a
trip
to
the
store
at
Carmody
,
and
he
sheepishly
*NL*
produced
a
small
parcel
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
Anne
,
with
a
*NL*
deprecatory
look
at
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
you
say
you
liked
chocolate
sweeties
,
so
I
got
you
some

''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph

''
sniffed
Marilla
.
``
It
'll
ruin
her
teeth
and
stomach
.
There
,
*NL*
there

child
,
do
n't
look
so
dismal
.
You
can
eat
those
,
since
Matthew
*NL*
has
gone
and
got
them
.
He
'd
better
have
brought
you
peppermints
.
They
're
*NL*
wholesomer
.
Do
n't
sicken
yourself
eating
all
them
at
once
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Anne
eagerly
.
``
I
'll
just
eat
one
*NL*
tonight
,
Marilla
.
And
I
can
give
Diana
half
of
them
,
ca
n't
I
?
The
*NL*
other
half
will
taste
twice
as
sweet
to
me
if
I
give
some
to
her
.
It
's
*NL*
delightful
to
think
I
have
something
to
give
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
say
it
for
the
child

''
said
Marilla
when
Anne
had
gone
to
*NL*
her
gable
,
``
she
is
n't
stingy
.
I
'm
glad
,
for
of
all
faults
I
detest
*NL*
stinginess
in
a
child
.
Dear
me
,
it
's
only
three
weeks
since
she
came
,
*NL*
and
it
seems
as
if
she
'd
been
here
always
.
I
ca
n't
imagine
the
place
*NL*
without
her
.
Now
,
do
n't
be
looking
I
told-you-so
,
Matthew
.
That
's
bad
*NL*
enough
in
a
woman
,
but
it
is
n't
to
be
endured
in
a
man
.
I
'm
perfectly
*NL*
willing
to
own
up
that
I
'm
glad
I
consented
to
keep
the
child
and
that
*NL*
I
'm
getting
fond
of
her

CHAPTER

The
Delights
of
Anticipation
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
Anne
was
in
to
do
her
sewing
,
''
said
Marilla
,
glancing
at
the
*NL*
clock
and
then
out
into
the
yellow
August
afternoon
where
everything
*NL*
drowsed
in
the
heat
.
``
She
stayed
playing
with
Diana
more
than
half
an
*NL*
hour
more
'n
I
gave
her
leave
to
;
and
now
she
's
perched
out
there
on
*NL*
the
woodpile
talking
to
Matthew
,
nineteen
to
the
dozen
,
when
she
knows
*NL*
perfectly
well
she
ought
to
be
at
her
work
.
And
of
course
he
's
listening
*NL*
to
her
like
a
perfect
ninny
.
I
never
saw
such
an
infatuated
man
.
*NL*
The
more
she
talks
and
the
odder
the
things
she
says
,
the
more
he
's
*NL*
delighted
evidently
.
Anne
Shirley
,
you
come
right
in
here
this
minute
,
*NL*
do
you
hear
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
series
of
staccato
taps
on
the
west
window
brought
Anne
flying
in
from
*NL*
the
yard
,
eyes
shining
,
cheeks
faintly
flushed
with
pink
,
unbraided
hair
*NL*
streaming
behind
her
in
a
torrent
of
brightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
,
``
there
's
going
to
be
a
*NL*
Sunday-school
picnic
next
week
--
in
Mr.
Harmon
Andrews
's
field
,
right
*NL*
near
the
lake
of
Shining
Waters
.
And
Mrs.
Superintendent
Bell
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
Lynde
are
going
to
make
ice
cream
--
think
of
it
,
Marilla
--
ICE
*NL*
CREAM

And
,
oh
,
Marilla
,
can
I
go
to
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
at
the
clock

if
you

Anne

What
time
did
I
tell
you
*NL*
to
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
o'clock
--
but
is
n't
it
splendid
about
the
picnic
,
Marilla
?
Please
*NL*
can
I
go
?
Oh
,
I
've
never
been
to
a
picnic
--
I
've
dreamed
of
picnics
,
but
*NL*
I
've
never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
told
you
to
come
at
two
o'clock

And
it
's
a
quarter
to
three
.
*NL*
I
'd
like
to
know
why
you
did
n't
obey
me
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
meant
to
,
Marilla
,
as
much
as
could
be
.
But
you
have
no
idea
*NL*
how
fascinating
Idlewild
is
.
And
then
,
of
course
,
I
had
to
tell
Matthew
*NL*
about
the
picnic
.
Matthew
is
such
a
sympathetic
listener
.
Please
can
I
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
learn
to
resist
the
fascination
of
*NL*
Idle-whatever-you-call-it
.
When
I
tell
you
to
come
in
at
a
certain
time
*NL*
I
mean
that
time
and
not
half
an
hour
later
.
And
you
need
n't
stop
to
*NL*
discourse
with
sympathetic
listeners
on
your
way
,
either
.
As
for
the
*NL*
picnic
,
of
course
you
can
go
.
You
're
a
Sunday-school
scholar

and
it
's
*NL*
not
likely
I
'd
refuse
to
let
you
go

all
the
other
little
girls
are
*NL*
going

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
but
,
''
faltered
Anne
,
``
Diana
says
that
everybody
must
take
a
basket
*NL*
of
things
to
eat

I
ca

cook

you
know
,
Marilla
,
and
--
and
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
going
to
a
picnic
without
puffed
sleeves
so
much
,
but
I
'd
feel
*NL*
terribly
humiliated
if
I
had
to
go
without
a
basket
.
It
's
been
preying
*NL*
on
my
mind
ever
since
Diana
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
need

prey
any

I
'll
bake
you
a
basket

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
dear
good
Marilla

Oh
,
you
are
so
kind
to
me

Oh
,
I
'm
so
much
*NL*
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Getting
through
with
her
``
ohs
''
Anne
cast
herself
into
Marilla
's
arms
and
*NL*
rapturously
kissed
her
sallow
cheek
.
It
was
the
first
time
in
her
whole
*NL*
life
that
childish
lips
had
voluntarily
touched
Marilla
's
face
.
Again
*NL*
that
sudden
sensation
of
startling
sweetness
thrilled
her
.
She
was
*NL*
secretly
vastly
pleased
at
Anne
's
impulsive
caress
,
which
was
probably
*NL*
the
reason
why
she
said
brusquely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
never
mind
your
kissing
nonsense
.
I
'd
sooner
see
you
*NL*
doing
strictly
as
you
're
told
.
As
for
cooking
,
I
mean
to
begin
giving
*NL*
you
lessons
in
that
some
of
these
days
.
But
you
're
so
featherbrained
,
*NL*
Anne
,
I
've
been
waiting
to
see
if
you
'd
sober
down
a
little
and
learn
*NL*
to
be
steady
before
I
begin
.
You
've
got
to
keep
your
wits
about
you
in
*NL*
cooking
and
not
stop
in
the
middle
of
things
to
let
your
thoughts
rove
*NL*
all
over
creation
.
Now
,
get
out
your
patchwork
and
have
your
square
done
*NL*
before
teatime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
NOT
like
patchwork
,
''
said
Anne
dolefully
,
hunting
out
her
*NL*
workbasket
and
sitting
down
before
a
little
heap
of
red
and
white
*NL*
diamonds
with
a
sigh
.
``
I
think
some
kinds
of
sewing
would
be
nice
;
but
*NL*
there
's
no
scope
for
imagination
in
patchwork
.
It
's
just
one
little
seam
*NL*
after
another
and
you
never
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
.
But
of
course
*NL*
I
'd
rather
be
Anne
of
Green
Gables
sewing
patchwork
than
Anne
of
any
*NL*
other
place
with
nothing
to
do
but
play
.
I
wish
time
went
as
quick
*NL*
sewing
patches
as
it
does
when
I
'm
playing
with
Diana
,
though
.
Oh
,
we
*NL*
do
have
such
elegant
times
,
Marilla
.
I
have
to
furnish
most
of
the
*NL*
imagination
,
but
I
'm
well
able
to
do
that
.
Diana
is
simply
perfect
in
*NL*
every
other
way
.
You
know
that
little
piece
of
land
across
the
brook
*NL*
that
runs
up
between
our
farm
and
Mr.
Barry
's
.
It
belongs
to
Mr.
William
*NL*
Bell
,
and
right
in
the
corner
there
is
a
little
ring
of
white
birch
*NL*
trees
--
the
most
romantic
spot
,
Marilla
.
Diana
and
I
have
our
playhouse
*NL*
there
.
We
call
it
Idlewild
.
Is
n't
that
a
poetical
name
?
I
assure
you
it
*NL*
took
me
some
time
to
think
it
out
.
I
stayed
awake
nearly
a
whole
night
*NL*
before
I
invented
it
.
Then
,
just
as
I
was
dropping
off
to
sleep
,
it
came
*NL*
like
an
inspiration
.
Diana
was
ENRAPTURED
when
she
heard
it
.
We
have
got
*NL*
our
house
fixed
up
elegantly
.
You
must
come
and
see
it
,
Marilla
--
wo
n't
*NL*
you
?
We
have
great
big
stones
,
all
covered
with
moss
,
for
seats
,
and
*NL*
boards
from
tree
to
tree
for
shelves
.
And
we
have
all
our
dishes
on
*NL*
them
.
Of
course
,
they
're
all
broken
but
it
's
the
easiest
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
to
imagine
that
they
are
whole
.
There
's
a
piece
of
a
plate
with
a
*NL*
spray
of
red
and
yellow
ivy
on
it
that
is
especially
beautiful
.
We
keep
*NL*
it
in
the
parlor
and
we
have
the
fairy
glass
there
,
too
.
The
fairy
glass
*NL*
is
as
lovely
as
a
dream
.
Diana
found
it
out
in
the
woods
behind
their
*NL*
chicken
house
.
It
's
all
full
of
rainbows
--
just
little
young
rainbows
*NL*
that
have
n't
grown
big
yet
--
and
Diana
's
mother
told
her
it
was
broken
*NL*
off
a
hanging
lamp
they
once
had
.
But
it
's
nice
to
imagine
the
fairies
*NL*
lost
it
one
night
when
they
had
a
ball
,
so
we
call
it
the
fairy
glass
.
*NL*
Matthew
is
going
to
make
us
a
table
.
Oh
,
we
have
named
that
little
round
*NL*
pool
over
in
Mr.
Barry
's
field
Willowmere
.
I
got
that
name
out
of
the
*NL*
book
Diana
lent
me
.
That
was
a
thrilling
book
,
Marilla
.
The
heroine
*NL*
had
five
lovers
.
I
'd
be
satisfied
with
one
,
would
n't
you
?
She
was
very
*NL*
handsome
and
she
went
through
great
tribulations
.
She
could
faint
as
*NL*
easy
as
anything
.
I
'd
love
to
be
able
to
faint
,
would
n't
you
,
Marilla
?
*NL*
It
's
so
romantic
.
But
I
'm
really
very
healthy
for
all
I
'm
so
thin
.
I
*NL*
believe
I
'm
getting
fatter
,
though
.
Do
n't
you
think
I
am
?
I
look
at
my
*NL*
elbows
every
morning
when
I
get
up
to
see
if
any
dimples
are
coming
.
*NL*
Diana
is
having
a
new
dress
made
with
elbow
sleeves
.
She
is
going
to
*NL*
wear
it
to
the
picnic
.
Oh
,
I
do
hope
it
will
be
fine
next
Wednesday
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
feel
that
I
could
endure
the
disappointment
if
anything
happened
*NL*
to
prevent
me
from
getting
to
the
picnic
.
I
suppose
I
'd
live
through
it
,
*NL*
but
I
'm
certain
it
would
be
a
lifelong
sorrow
.
It
would
n't
matter
if
*NL*
I
got
to
a
hundred
picnics
in
after
years
;
they
would
n't
make
up
for
*NL*
missing
this
one
.
They
're
going
to
have
boats
on
the
Lake
of
Shining
*NL*
Waters
--
and
ice
cream
,
as
I
told
you
.
I
have
never
tasted
ice
cream
.
*NL*
Diana
tried
to
explain
what
it
was
like
,
but
I
guess
ice
cream
is
one
of
*NL*
those
things
that
are
beyond
imagination
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
you
have
talked
even
on
for
ten
minutes
by
the
clock
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
Now
,
just
for
curiosity
's
sake
,
see
if
you
can
hold
your
*NL*
tongue
for
the
same
length
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
held
her
tongue
as
desired
.
But
for
the
rest
of
the
week
she
talked
*NL*
picnic
and
thought
picnic
and
dreamed
picnic
.
On
Saturday
it
rained
and
*NL*
she
worked
herself
up
into
such
a
frantic
state
lest
it
should
keep
*NL*
on
raining
until
and
over
Wednesday
that
Marilla
made
her
sew
an
extra
*NL*
patchwork
square
by
way
of
steadying
her
nerves
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
Anne
confided
to
Marilla
on
the
way
home
from
church
that
she
*NL*
grew
actually
cold
all
over
with
excitement
when
the
minister
announced
*NL*
the
picnic
from
the
pulpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
thrill
as
went
up
and
down
my
back
,
Marilla
!
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
*NL*
ever
really
believed
until
then
that
there
was
honestly
going
to
be
*NL*
a
picnic
.
I
could
n't
help
fearing
I
'd
only
imagined
it
.
But
when
a
*NL*
minister
says
a
thing
in
the
pulpit
you
just
have
to
believe
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
set
your
heart
too
much
on
things
,
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
,
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
``
I
'm
afraid
there
'll
be
a
great
many
disappointments
in
store
for
*NL*
you
through
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
looking
forward
to
things
is
half
the
pleasure
of
them
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Anne
.
``
You
may
n't
get
the
things
themselves
;
but
nothing
can
*NL*
prevent
you
from
having
the
fun
of
looking
forward
to
them
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
says
,
`
Blessed
are
they
who
expect
nothing
for
they
shall
not
be
*NL*
disappointed
.
'
But
I
think
it
would
be
worse
to
expect
nothing
than
to
*NL*
be
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
wore
her
amethyst
brooch
to
church
that
day
as
usual
.
Marilla
*NL*
always
wore
her
amethyst
brooch
to
church
.
She
would
have
thought
it
*NL*
rather
sacrilegious
to
leave
it
off
--
as
bad
as
forgetting
her
Bible
or
*NL*
her
collection
dime
.
That
amethyst
brooch
was
Marilla
's
most
treasured
*NL*
possession
.
A
seafaring
uncle
had
given
it
to
her
mother
who
in
turn
*NL*
had
bequeathed
it
to
Marilla
.
It
was
an
old-fashioned
oval
,
containing
*NL*
a
braid
of
her
mother
's
hair
,
surrounded
by
a
border
of
very
fine
*NL*
amethysts
.
Marilla
knew
too
little
about
precious
stones
to
realize
how
*NL*
fine
the
amethysts
actually
were
;
but
she
thought
them
very
beautiful
*NL*
and
was
always
pleasantly
conscious
of
their
violet
shimmer
at
her
*NL*
throat
,
above
her
good
brown
satin
dress
,
even
although
she
could
not
*NL*
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
been
smitten
with
delighted
admiration
when
she
first
saw
that
*NL*
brooch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
's
a
perfectly
elegant
brooch
.
I
do
n't
know
how
you
*NL*
can
pay
attention
to
the
sermon
or
the
prayers
when
you
have
it
on
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
,
I
know
.
I
think
amethysts
are
just
sweet
.
They
are
what
I
used
*NL*
to
think
diamonds
were
like
.
Long
ago
,
before
I
had
ever
seen
a
diamond
,
*NL*
I
read
about
them
and
I
tried
to
imagine
what
they
would
be
like
.
I
*NL*
thought
they
would
be
lovely
glimmering
purple
stones
.
When
I
saw
a
*NL*
real
diamond
in
a
lady
's
ring
one
day
I
was
so
disappointed
I
cried
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
it
was
very
lovely
but
it
was
n't
my
idea
of
a
diamond
.
Will
you
*NL*
let
me
hold
the
brooch
for
one
minute
,
Marilla
?
Do
you
think
amethysts
*NL*
can
be
the
souls
of
good
violets
?

CHAPTER
XIV
.
Anne
's
Confession
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ON
the
Monday
evening
before
the
picnic
Marilla
came
down
from
her
room
*NL*
with
a
troubled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
she
said
to
that
small
personage
,
who
was
shelling
peas
by
the
*NL*
spotless
table
and
singing
,
``
Nelly
of
the
Hazel
Dell
''
with
a
vigor
and
*NL*
expression
that
did
credit
to
Diana
's
teaching
,
``
did
you
see
anything
*NL*
of
my
amethyst
brooch
?
I
thought
I
stuck
it
in
my
pincushion
when
I
came
*NL*
home
from
church
yesterday
evening
,
but
I
ca
n't
find
it
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
saw
it
this
afternoon
when
you
were
away
at
the
Aid
Society
,
''
said
*NL*
Anne
,
a
little
slowly
.
``
I
was
passing
your
door
when
I
saw
it
on
the
*NL*
cushion
,
so
I
went
in
to
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
touch
it
?
''
said
Marilla
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Y-e-e-s
,
''
admitted
Anne
,
``
I
took
it
up
and
I
pinned
it
on
my
breast
*NL*
just
to
see
how
it
would
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
no
business
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
.
It
's
very
wrong
in
a
*NL*
little
girl
to
meddle
.
You
should
n't
have
gone
into
my
room
in
the
first
*NL*
place
and
you
should
n't
have
touched
a
brooch
that
did
n't
belong
to
you
*NL*
in
the
second
.
Where
did
you
put
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
put
it
back
on
the
bureau
.
I
had
n't
it
on
a
minute
.
Truly
,
I
*NL*
did
n't
mean
to
meddle
,
Marilla
.
I
did
n't
think
about
its
being
wrong
to
*NL*
go
in
and
try
on
the
brooch
;
but
I
see
now
that
it
was
and
I
'll
never
*NL*
do
it
again
.
That
's
one
good
thing
about
me
.
I
never
do
the
same
naughty
*NL*
thing
twice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
put
it
back
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
That
brooch
is
n't
anywhere
on
*NL*
the
bureau
.
You
've
taken
it
out
or
something
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
put
it
back
,
''
said
Anne
quickly
--
pertly
,
Marilla
thought
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
just
remember
whether
I
stuck
it
on
the
pincushion
or
laid
it
in
*NL*
the
china
tray
.
But
I
'm
perfectly
certain
I
put
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
have
another
look
,
''
said
Marilla
,
determining
to
be
just
.
*NL*
``
If
you
put
that
brooch
back
it
's
there
still
.
If
it
is
n't
I
'll
know
you
*NL*
did
n't
,
that
's
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
went
to
her
room
and
made
a
thorough
search
,
not
only
over
the
*NL*
bureau
but
in
every
other
place
she
thought
the
brooch
might
possibly
*NL*
be
.
It
was
not
to
be
found
and
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
the
brooch
is
gone
.
By
your
own
admission
you
were
the
last
*NL*
person
to
handle
it
.
Now
,
what
have
you
done
with
it
?
Tell
me
the
truth
*NL*
at
once
.
Did
you
take
it
out
and
lose
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
,
''
said
Anne
solemnly
,
meeting
Marilla
's
angry
gaze
*NL*
squarely
.
``
I
never
took
the
brooch
out
of
your
room
and
that
is
the
*NL*
truth
,
if
I
was
to
be
led
to
the
block
for
it
--
although
I
'm
not
very
*NL*
certain
what
a
block
is
.
So
there
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
``
so
there
''
was
only
intended
to
emphasize
her
assertion
,
but
*NL*
Marilla
took
it
as
a
display
of
defiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
are
telling
me
a
falsehood
,
Anne
,
''
she
said
sharply
.
``
I
*NL*
know
you
are
.
There
now
,
do
n't
say
anything
more
unless
you
are
prepared
*NL*
to
tell
the
whole
truth
.
Go
to
your
room
and
stay
there
until
you
are
*NL*
ready
to
confess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
take
the
peas
with
me
?
''
said
Anne
meekly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'll
finish
shelling
them
myself
.
Do
as
I
bid
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anne
had
gone
Marilla
went
about
her
evening
tasks
in
a
very
*NL*
disturbed
state
of
mind
.
She
was
worried
about
her
valuable
brooch
.
What
*NL*
if
Anne
had
lost
it
?
And
how
wicked
of
the
child
to
deny
having
taken
*NL*
it
,
when
anybody
could
see
she
must
have
!
With
such
an
innocent
face
,
*NL*
too
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
would
n't
sooner
have
had
happen
,
''
thought
Marilla
,
*NL*
as
she
nervously
shelled
the
peas
.
``
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
suppose
she
meant
*NL*
to
steal
it
or
anything
like
that
.
She
's
just
taken
it
to
play
with
*NL*
or
help
along
that
imagination
of
hers
.
She
must
have
taken
it
,
that
's
*NL*
clear
,
for
there
has
n't
been
a
soul
in
that
room
since
she
was
in
it
,
by
*NL*
her
own
story
,
until
I
went
up
tonight
.
And
the
brooch
is
gone
,
there
's
*NL*
nothing
surer
.
I
suppose
she
has
lost
it
and
is
afraid
to
own
up
for
*NL*
fear
she
'll
be
punished
.
It
's
a
dreadful
thing
to
think
she
tells
*NL*
falsehoods
.
It
's
a
far
worse
thing
than
her
fit
of
temper
.
It
's
a
*NL*
fearful
responsibility
to
have
a
child
in
your
house
you
ca
n't
trust
.
*NL*
Slyness
and
untruthfulness
--
that
's
what
she
has
displayed
.
I
declare
I
*NL*
feel
worse
about
that
than
about
the
brooch
.
If
she
'd
only
have
told
the
*NL*
truth
about
it
I
would
n't
mind
so
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
went
to
her
room
at
intervals
all
through
the
evening
and
*NL*
searched
for
the
brooch
,
without
finding
it
.
A
bedtime
visit
to
the
*NL*
east
gable
produced
no
result
.
Anne
persisted
in
denying
that
she
knew
*NL*
anything
about
the
brooch
but
Marilla
was
only
the
more
firmly
convinced
*NL*
that
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
Matthew
the
story
the
next
morning
.
Matthew
was
confounded
and
*NL*
puzzled
;
he
could
not
so
quickly
lose
faith
in
Anne
but
he
had
to
admit
*NL*
that
circumstances
were
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
sure
it
has
n't
fell
down
behind
the
bureau
?
''
was
the
only
*NL*
suggestion
he
could
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
moved
the
bureau
and
I
've
taken
out
the
drawers
and
I
've
looked
*NL*
in
every
crack
and
cranny
''
was
Marilla
's
positive
answer
.
``
The
brooch
*NL*
is
gone
and
that
child
has
taken
it
and
lied
about
it
.
That
's
the
plain
,
*NL*
ugly
truth
,
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
and
we
might
as
well
look
it
in
the
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
?
''
Matthew
asked
forlornly
,
*NL*
feeling
secretly
thankful
that
Marilla
and
not
he
had
to
deal
with
the
*NL*
situation
.
He
felt
no
desire
to
put
his
oar
in
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
stay
in
her
room
until
she
confesses
,
''
said
Marilla
grimly
,
*NL*
remembering
the
success
of
this
method
in
the
former
case
.
``
Then
we
'll
*NL*
see
.
Perhaps
we
'll
be
able
to
find
the
brooch
if
she
'll
only
tell
*NL*
where
she
took
it
;
but
in
any
case
she
'll
have
to
be
severely
punished
,
*NL*
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
you
'll
have
to
punish
her
,
''
said
Matthew
,
reaching
for
his
*NL*
hat
.
``
I
've
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
remember
.
You
warned
me
off
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
felt
deserted
by
everyone
.
She
could
not
even
go
to
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
for
advice
.
She
went
up
to
the
east
gable
with
a
very
serious
face
and
*NL*
left
it
with
a
face
more
serious
still
.
Anne
steadfastly
refused
to
*NL*
confess
.
She
persisted
in
asserting
that
she
had
not
taken
the
brooch
.
*NL*
The
child
had
evidently
been
crying
and
Marilla
felt
a
pang
of
pity
*NL*
which
she
sternly
repressed
.
By
night
she
was
,
as
she
expressed
it
,
*NL*
``
beat

she
said
firmly
.

*NL*

cried
Anne
.

out

*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
gasped
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marilla
had
gone
out
and
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wednesday
morning
dawned
as
bright
and
fair
as
if
expressly
made
to
*NL*
order
for
the
picnic
.
Birds
sang
around
Green
Gables
;
the
Madonna
lilies
*NL*
in
the
garden
sent
out
whiffs
of
perfume
that
entered
in
on
viewless
*NL*
winds
at
every
door
and
window
,
and
wandered
through
halls
and
rooms
*NL*
like
spirits
of
benediction
.
The
birches
in
the
hollow
waved
joyful
*NL*
hands
as
if
watching
for
Anne
's
usual
morning
greeting
from
the
east
*NL*
gable
.
But
Anne
was
not
at
her
window
.
When
Marilla
took
her
breakfast
*NL*
up
to
her
she
found
the
child
sitting
primly
on
her
bed
,
pale
and
*NL*
resolute
,
with
tight-shut
lips
and
gleaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
,
I
'm
ready
to
confess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
Marilla
laid
down
her
tray
.
Once
again
her
method
had
succeeded
;
*NL*
but
her
success
was
very
bitter
to
her
.
``
Let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
*NL*
say
then
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
amethyst
brooch
,
''
said
Anne
,
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
she
*NL*
had
learned
.
``
I
took
it
just
as
you
said
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
take
it
when
*NL*
I
went
in
.
But
it
did
look
so
beautiful
,
Marilla
,
when
I
pinned
it
on
my
*NL*
breast
that
I
was
overcome
by
an
irresistible
temptation
.
I
imagined
how
*NL*
perfectly
thrilling
it
would
be
to
take
it
to
Idlewild
and
play
I
was
*NL*
the
Lady
Cordelia
Fitzgerald
.
It
would
be
so
much
easier
to
imagine
I
*NL*
was
the
Lady
Cordelia
if
I
had
a
real
amethyst
brooch
on
.
Diana
and
*NL*
I
make
necklaces
of
roseberries
but
what
are
roseberries
compared
to
*NL*
amethysts
?
So
I
took
the
brooch
.
I
thought
I
could
put
it
back
before
*NL*
you
came
home
.
I
went
all
the
way
around
by
the
road
to
lengthen
out
the
*NL*
time
.
When
I
was
going
over
the
bridge
across
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
*NL*
I
took
the
brooch
off
to
have
another
look
at
it
.
Oh
,
how
it
did
shine
*NL*
in
the
sunlight
!
And
then
,
when
I
was
leaning
over
the
bridge
,
it
*NL*
just
slipped
through
my
fingers
--
so
--
and
went
down
--
down
--
down
,
all
*NL*
purply-sparkling
,
and
sank
forevermore
beneath
the
Lake
of
Shining
*NL*
Waters
.
And
that
's
the
best
I
can
do
at
confessing
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
felt
hot
anger
surge
up
into
her
heart
again
.
This
child
had
*NL*
taken
and
lost
her
treasured
amethyst
brooch
and
now
sat
there
calmly
*NL*
reciting
the
details
thereof
without
the
least
apparent
compunction
or
*NL*
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
this
is
terrible
,
''
she
said
,
trying
to
speak
calmly
.
``
You
are
the
*NL*
very
wickedest
girl
I
ever
heard
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
I
am
,
''
agreed
Anne
tranquilly
.
``
And
I
know
I
'll
have
to
*NL*
be
punished
.
It
'll
be
your
duty
to
punish
me
,
Marilla
.
Wo
n't
you
please
*NL*
get
it
over
right
off
because
I
'd
like
to
go
to
the
picnic
with
nothing
*NL*
on
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Picnic
,
indeed
!
You
'll
go
to
no
picnic
today
,
Anne
Shirley
.
That
shall
*NL*
be
your
punishment
.
And
it
is
n't
half
severe
enough
either
for
what
*NL*
you
've
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
go
to
the
picnic
!
''
Anne
sprang
to
her
feet
and
clutched
Marilla
's
*NL*
hand
.
``
But
you
PROMISED
me
I
might
!
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
must
go
to
the
*NL*
picnic
.
That
was
why
I
confessed
.
Punish
me
any
way
you
like
but
that
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Marilla
,
please
,
please
,
let
me
go
to
the
picnic
.
Think
of
the
ice
*NL*
cream
!
For
anything
you
know
I
may
never
have
a
chance
to
taste
ice
*NL*
cream
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
disengaged
Anne
's
clinging
hands
stonily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
plead
,
Anne
.
You
are
not
going
to
the
picnic
and
that
's
*NL*
final
.
No
,
not
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
realized
that
Marilla
was
not
to
be
moved
.
She
clasped
her
hands
*NL*
together
,
gave
a
piercing
shriek
,
and
then
flung
herself
face
*NL*
downward
on
the
bed
,
crying
and
writhing
in
an
utter
abandonment
of
*NL*
disappointment
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
land
's
sake
!
''
gasped
Marilla
,
hastening
from
the
room
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
the
child
is
crazy
.
No
child
in
her
senses
would
behave
as
she
*NL*
does
.
If
she
is
n't
she
's
utterly
bad
.
Oh
dear
,
I
'm
afraid
Rachel
was
*NL*
right
from
the
first
.
But
I
've
put
my
hand
to
the
plow
and
I
wo
n't
look
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
dismal
morning
.
Marilla
worked
fiercely
and
scrubbed
the
*NL*
porch
floor
and
the
dairy
shelves
when
she
could
find
nothing
else
to
*NL*
do
.
Neither
the
shelves
nor
the
porch
needed
it
--
but
Marilla
did
.
Then
*NL*
she
went
out
and
raked
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
dinner
was
ready
she
went
to
the
stairs
and
called
Anne
.
A
*NL*
tear-stained
face
appeared
,
looking
tragically
over
the
banisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
to
your
dinner
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
any
dinner
,
Marilla
,
''
said
Anne
,
sobbingly
.
``
I
could
n't
*NL*
eat
anything
.
My
heart
is
broken
.
You
'll
feel
remorse
of
conscience
*NL*
someday
,
I
expect
,
for
breaking
it
,
Marilla
,
but
I
forgive
you
.
Remember
*NL*
when
the
time
comes
that
I
forgive
you
.
But
please
do
n't
ask
me
to
eat
*NL*
anything
,
especially
boiled
pork
and
greens
.
Boiled
pork
and
greens
are
*NL*
so
unromantic
when
one
is
in
affliction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Exasperated
,
Marilla
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
poured
out
her
tale
*NL*
of
woe
to
Matthew
,
who
,
between
his
sense
of
justice
and
his
unlawful
*NL*
sympathy
with
Anne
,
was
a
miserable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
she
should
n't
have
taken
the
brooch
,
Marilla
,
or
told
stories
*NL*
about
it
,
''
he
admitted
,
mournfully
surveying
his
plateful
of
unromantic
*NL*
pork
and
greens
as
if
he
,
like
Anne
,
thought
it
a
food
unsuited
to
*NL*
crises
of
feeling
,
``
but
she
's
such
a
little
thing
--
such
an
interesting
*NL*
little
thing
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
pretty
rough
not
to
let
her
go
to
the
*NL*
picnic
when
she
's
so
set
on
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Cuthbert
,
I
'm
amazed
at
you
.
I
think
I
've
let
her
off
entirely
*NL*
too
easy
.
And
she
does
n't
appear
to
realize
how
wicked
she
's
been
at
*NL*
all
--
that
's
what
worries
me
most
.
If
she
'd
really
felt
sorry
it
would
n't
*NL*
be
so
bad
.
And
you
do
n't
seem
to
realize
it
,
neither
;
you
're
making
*NL*
excuses
for
her
all
the
time
to
yourself
--
I
can
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
she
's
such
a
little
thing
,
''
feebly
reiterated
Matthew
.
``
And
*NL*
there
should
be
allowances
made
,
Marilla
.
You
know
she
's
never
had
any
*NL*
bringing
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
having
it
now
''
retorted
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
retort
silenced
Matthew
if
it
did
not
convince
him
.
That
dinner
was
*NL*
a
very
dismal
meal
.
The
only
cheerful
thing
about
it
was
Jerry
Buote
,
*NL*
the
hired
boy
,
and
Marilla
resented
his
cheerfulness
as
a
personal
*NL*
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
dishes
were
washed
and
her
bread
sponge
set
and
her
hens
fed
*NL*
Marilla
remembered
that
she
had
noticed
a
small
rent
in
her
best
black
*NL*
lace
shawl
when
she
had
taken
it
off
on
Monday
afternoon
on
returning
*NL*
from
the
Ladies
'
Aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
go
and
mend
it
.
The
shawl
was
in
a
box
in
her
trunk
.
As
*NL*
Marilla
lifted
it
out
,
the
sunlight
,
falling
through
the
vines
that
*NL*
clustered
thickly
about
the
window
,
struck
upon
something
caught
in
the
*NL*
shawl
--
something
that
glittered
and
sparkled
in
facets
of
violet
light
.
*NL*
Marilla
snatched
at
it
with
a
gasp
.
It
was
the
amethyst
brooch
,
hanging
*NL*
to
a
thread
of
the
lace
by
its
catch
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
life
and
heart
,
''
said
Marilla
blankly
,
``
what
does
this
mean
?
*NL*
Here
's
my
brooch
safe
and
sound
that
I
thought
was
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
Barry
's
pond
.
Whatever
did
that
girl
mean
by
saying
she
took
it
and
lost
*NL*
it
?
I
declare
I
believe
Green
Gables
is
bewitched
.
I
remember
now
that
*NL*
when
I
took
off
my
shawl
Monday
afternoon
I
laid
it
on
the
bureau
for
a
*NL*
minute
.
I
suppose
the
brooch
got
caught
in
it
somehow
.
Well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
betook
herself
to
the
east
gable
,
brooch
in
hand
.
Anne
had
cried
*NL*
herself
out
and
was
sitting
dejectedly
by
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
''
said
Marilla
solemnly
,
``
I
've
just
found
my
brooch
*NL*
hanging
to
my
black
lace
shawl
.
Now
I
want
to
know
what
that
rigmarole
*NL*
you
told
me
this
morning
meant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
said
you
'd
keep
me
here
until
I
confessed
,
''
returned
Anne
*NL*
wearily
,
``
and
so
I
decided
to
confess
because
I
was
bound
to
get
to
the
*NL*
picnic
.
I
thought
out
a
confession
last
night
after
I
went
to
bed
and
*NL*
made
it
as
interesting
as
I
could
.
And
I
said
it
over
and
over
so
that
I
*NL*
would
n't
forget
it
.
But
you
would
n't
let
me
go
to
the
picnic
after
all
,
*NL*
so
all
my
trouble
was
wasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
to
laugh
in
spite
of
herself
.
But
her
conscience
pricked
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
you
do
beat
all
!
But
I
was
wrong
--
I
see
that
now
.
I
should
n't
*NL*
have
doubted
your
word
when
I
'd
never
known
you
to
tell
a
story
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
was
n't
right
for
you
to
confess
to
a
thing
you
had
n't
*NL*
done
--
it
was
very
wrong
to
do
so
.
But
I
drove
you
to
it
.
So
if
you
'll
*NL*
forgive
me
,
Anne
,
I
'll
forgive
you
and
we
'll
start
square
again
.
And
now
*NL*
get
yourself
ready
for
the
picnic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
flew
up
like
a
rocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
is
n't
it
too
late
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
only
two
o'clock
.
They
wo
n't
be
more
than
well
gathered
yet
*NL*
and
it
'll
be
an
hour
before
they
have
tea
.
Wash
your
face
and
comb
your
*NL*
hair
and
put
on
your
gingham
.
I
'll
fill
a
basket
for
you
.
There
's
plenty
*NL*
of
stuff
baked
in
the
house
.
And
I
'll
get
Jerry
to
hitch
up
the
sorrel
*NL*
and
drive
you
down
to
the
picnic
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
exclaimed
Anne
,
flying
to
the
washstand
.
``
Five
minutes
*NL*
ago
I
was
so
miserable
I
was
wishing
I
'd
never
been
born
and
now
I
*NL*
would
n't
change
places
with
an
angel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
a
thoroughly
happy
,
completely
tired-out
Anne
returned
to
*NL*
Green
Gables
in
a
state
of
beatification
impossible
to
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
've
had
a
perfectly
scrumptious
time
.
Scrumptious
is
a
*NL*
new
word
I
learned
today
.
I
heard
Mary
Alice
Bell
use
it
.
Is
n't
it
very
*NL*
expressive
?
Everything
was
lovely
.
We
had
a
splendid
tea
and
then
Mr.
*NL*
Harmon
Andrews
took
us
all
for
a
row
on
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
--
six
*NL*
of
us
at
a
time
.
And
Jane
Andrews
nearly
fell
overboard
.
She
was
leaning
*NL*
out
to
pick
water
lilies
and
if
Mr.
Andrews
had
n't
caught
her
by
her
*NL*
sash
just
in
the
nick
of
time
she
'd
fallen
in
and
prob
`
ly
been
drowned
.
*NL*
I
wish
it
had
been
me
.
It
would
have
been
such
a
romantic
experience
to
*NL*
have
been
nearly
drowned
.
It
would
be
such
a
thrilling
tale
to
tell
.
And
*NL*
we
had
the
ice
cream
.
Words
fail
me
to
describe
that
ice
cream
.
Marilla
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
it
was
sublime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Marilla
told
the
whole
story
to
Matthew
over
her
stocking
*NL*
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
to
own
up
that
I
made
a
mistake
,
''
she
concluded
candidly
,
*NL*
``
but
I
've
learned
a
lesson
.
I
have
to
laugh
when
I
think
of
Anne
's
*NL*
`
confession

'
although
I
suppose
I
should
n't
for
it

was
a
*NL*
falsehood

But
it
does
n't
seem
as
bad
as
the
other
would
have
been
,
*NL*
somehow
,
and
anyhow
I
'm
responsible
for
it

That
child
is
hard
to
*NL*
understand
in
some
respects
.
But
I
believe
she
'll
turn
out
all
right
*NL*
yet

And
there
's
one
thing
certain

no

will
ever

dull
that

she

in

CHAPTER
XV
.
A
Tempest
in
the
School
Teapot
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
splendid
day
!
''
said
Anne
,
drawing
a
long
breath
.
``
Is
n't
it
good
*NL*
just
to
be
alive
on
a
day
like
this
?
I
pity
the
people
who
are
n't
born
*NL*
yet
for
missing
it
.
They
may
have
good
days
,
of
course
,
but
they
can
*NL*
never
have
this
one
.
And
it
's
splendider
still
to
have
such
a
lovely
way
*NL*
to
go
to
school
by
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lot
nicer
than
going
round
by
the
road
;
that
is
so
dusty
*NL*
and
hot
,
''
said
Diana
practically
,
peeping
into
her
dinner
basket
and
*NL*
mentally
calculating
if
the
three
juicy
,
toothsome
,
raspberry
tarts
*NL*
reposing
there
were
divided
among
ten
girls
how
many
bites
each
girl
*NL*
would
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girls
of
Avonlea
school
always
pooled
their
lunches
,
and
*NL*
to
eat
three
raspberry
tarts
all
alone
or
even
to
share
them
only
with
*NL*
one
's
best
chum
would
have
forever
and
ever
branded
as
``
awful
mean
''
the
*NL*
girl
who
did
it
.
And
yet
,
when
the
tarts
were
divided
among
ten
girls
*NL*
you
just
got
enough
to
tantalize
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
Anne
and
Diana
went
to
school
WAS
a
pretty
one
.
Anne
thought
*NL*
those
walks
to
and
from
school
with
Diana
could
n't
be
improved
upon
*NL*
even
by
imagination
.
Going
around
by
the
main
road
would
have
been
so
*NL*
unromantic
;
but
to
go
by
Lover
's
Lane
and
Willowmere
and
Violet
Vale
and
*NL*
the
Birch
Path
was
romantic
,
if
ever
anything
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lover
's
Lane
opened
out
below
the
orchard
at
Green
Gables
and
stretched
*NL*
far
up
into
the
woods
to
the
end
of
the
Cuthbert
farm
.
It
was
the
way
by
*NL*
which
the
cows
were
taken
to
the
back
pasture
and
the
wood
hauled
home
*NL*
in
winter
.
Anne
had
named
it
Lover
's
Lane
before
she
had
been
a
month
at
*NL*
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
lovers
ever
really
walk
there
,
''
she
explained
to
Marilla
,
*NL*
``
but
Diana
and
I
are
reading
a
perfectly
magnificent
book
and
there
's
a
*NL*
Lover
's
Lane
in
it
.
So
we
want
to
have
one
,
too
.
And
it
's
a
very
pretty
*NL*
name
,
do
n't
you
think
?
So
romantic
!
We
ca
n't
imagine
the
lovers
into
it
,
*NL*
you
know
.
I
like
that
lane
because
you
can
think
out
loud
there
without
*NL*
people
calling
you
crazy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
starting
out
alone
in
the
morning
,
went
down
Lover
's
Lane
as
far
*NL*
as
the
brook
.
Here
Diana
met
her
,
and
the
two
little
girls
went
on
*NL*
up
the
lane
under
the
leafy
arch
of
maples
--
``
maples
are
such
sociable
*NL*
trees
,
''
said
Anne
;
``
they
're
always
rustling
and
whispering
to
*NL*
you
''
--
until
they
came
to
a
rustic
bridge
.
Then
they
left
the
lane
*NL*
and
walked
through
Mr.
Barry
's
back
field
and
past
Willowmere
.
Beyond
*NL*
Willowmere
came
Violet
Vale
--
a
little
green
dimple
in
the
shadow
of
Mr.
*NL*
Andrew
Bell
's
big
woods
.
``
Of
course
there
are
no
violets
there
now
,
''
*NL*
Anne
told
Marilla
,
``
but
Diana
says
there
are
millions
of
them
in
spring
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Marilla
,
ca
n't
you
just
imagine
you
see
them
?
It
actually
takes
away
*NL*
my
breath
.
I
named
it
Violet
Vale
.
Diana
says
she
never
saw
the
beat
*NL*
of
me
for
hitting
on
fancy
names
for
places
.
It
's
nice
to
be
clever
at
*NL*
something
,
is
n't
it
?
But
Diana
named
the
Birch
Path
.
She
wanted
to
,
so
*NL*
I
let
her
;
but
I
'm
sure
I
could
have
found
something
more
poetical
than
*NL*
plain
Birch
Path
.
Anybody
can
think
of
a
name
like
that
.
But
the
Birch
*NL*
Path
is
one
of
the
prettiest
places
in
the
world
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
.
Other
people
besides
Anne
thought
so
when
they
stumbled
on
it
.
*NL*
It
was
a
little
narrow
,
twisting
path
,
winding
down
over
a
long
hill
*NL*
straight
through
Mr.
Bell
's
woods
,
where
the
light
came
down
sifted
*NL*
through
so
many
emerald
screens
that
it
was
as
flawless
as
the
heart
*NL*
of
a
diamond
.
It
was
fringed
in
all
its
length
with
slim
young
birches
,
*NL*
white
stemmed
and
lissom
boughed
;
ferns
and
starflowers
and
wild
*NL*
lilies-of-the-valley
and
scarlet
tufts
of
pigeonberries
grew
thickly
*NL*
along
it
;
and
always
there
was
a
delightful
spiciness
in
the
air
and
*NL*
music
of
bird
calls
and
the
murmur
and
laugh
of
wood
winds
in
the
trees
*NL*
overhead
.
Now
and
then
you
might
see
a
rabbit
skipping
across
the
road
*NL*
if
you
were
quiet
--
which
,
with
Anne
and
Diana
,
happened
about
once
in
*NL*
a
blue
moon
.
Down
in
the
valley
the
path
came
out
to
the
main
road
and
*NL*
then
it
was
just
up
the
spruce
hill
to
the
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Avonlea
school
was
a
whitewashed
building
,
low
in
the
eaves
and
*NL*
wide
in
the
windows
,
furnished
inside
with
comfortable
substantial
*NL*
old-fashioned
desks
that
opened
and
shut
,
and
were
carved
all
over
their
*NL*
lids
with
the
initials
and
hieroglyphics
of
three
generations
of
school
*NL*
children
.
The
schoolhouse
was
set
back
from
the
road
and
behind
it
was
*NL*
a
dusky
fir
wood
and
a
brook
where
all
the
children
put
their
bottles
of
*NL*
milk
in
the
morning
to
keep
cool
and
sweet
until
dinner
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
seen
Anne
start
off
to
school
on
the
first
day
of
September
*NL*
with
many
secret
misgivings
.
Anne
was
such
an
odd
girl
.
How
would
she
*NL*
get
on
with
the
other
children
?
And
how
on
earth
would
she
ever
manage
*NL*
to
hold
her
tongue
during
school
hours
?
*NL*
*NL*
Things
went
better
than
Marilla
feared
,
however
.
Anne
came
home
that
*NL*
evening
in
high
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'm
going
to
like
school
here
,
''
she
announced
.
``
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
much
of
the
master
,
through
.
He
's
all
the
time
curling
his
mustache
*NL*
and
making
eyes
at
Prissy
Andrews
.
Prissy
is
grown
up
,
you
know
.
She
's
*NL*
sixteen
and
she
's
studying
for
the
entrance
examination
into
Queen
's
*NL*
Academy
at
Charlottetown
next
year
.
Tillie
Boulter
says
the
master
is
*NL*
DEAD
GONE
on
her
.
She
's
got
a
beautiful
complexion
and
curly
brown
hair
*NL*
and
she
does
it
up
so
elegantly
.
She
sits
in
the
long
seat
at
the
back
*NL*
and
he
sits
there
,
too
,
most
of
the
time
--
to
explain
her
lessons
,
he
*NL*
says
.
But
Ruby
Gillis
says
she
saw
him
writing
something
on
her
slate
*NL*
and
when
Prissy
read
it
she
blushed
as
red
as
a
beet
and
giggled
;
and
*NL*
Ruby
Gillis
says
she
does
n't
believe
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
*NL*
lesson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
do
n't
let
me
hear
you
talking
about
your
teacher
in
that
*NL*
way
again
,
''
said
Marilla
sharply
.
``
You
do
n't
go
to
school
to
criticize
*NL*
the
master
.
I
guess
he
can
teach
YOU
something
,
and
it
's
your
business
*NL*
to
learn
.
And
I
want
you
to
understand
right
off
that
you
are
not
to
*NL*
come
home
telling
tales
about
him
.
That
is
something
I
wo
n't
encourage
.
*NL*
I
hope
you
were
a
good
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
was
,
''
said
Anne
comfortably
.
``
It
was
n't
so
hard
as
you
might
*NL*
imagine
,
either
.
I
sit
with
Diana
.
Our
seat
is
right
by
the
window
and
*NL*
we
can
look
down
to
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
.
There
are
a
lot
of
nice
*NL*
girls
in
school
and
we
had
scrumptious
fun
playing
at
dinnertime
.
It
's
*NL*
so
nice
to
have
a
lot
of
little
girls
to
play
with
.
But
of
course
I
like
*NL*
Diana
best
and
always
will
.
I
ADORE
Diana
.
I
'm
dreadfully
far
behind
the
*NL*
others
.
They
're
all
in
the
fifth
book
and
I
'm
only
in
the
fourth
.
I
feel
*NL*
that
it
's
kind
of
a
disgrace
.
But
there
's
not
one
of
them
has
such
an
*NL*
imagination
as
I
have
and
I
soon
found
that
out
.
We
had
reading
and
*NL*
geography
and
Canadian
history
and
dictation
today
.
Mr.
Phillips
said
my
*NL*
spelling
was
disgraceful
and
he
held
up
my
slate
so
that
everybody
could
*NL*
see
it
,
all
marked
over
.
I
felt
so
mortified
,
Marilla
;
he
might
have
*NL*
been
politer
to
a
stranger
,
I
think
.
Ruby
Gillis
gave
me
an
apple
and
*NL*
Sophia
Sloane
lent
me
a
lovely
pink
card
with
`
May
I
see
you
home
?
'
on
*NL*
it
.
I
'm
to
give
it
back
to
her
tomorrow
.
And
Tillie
Boulter
let
me
wear
*NL*
her
bead
ring
all
the
afternoon
.
Can
I
have
some
of
those
pearl
beads
*NL*
off
the
old
pincushion
in
the
garret
to
make
myself
a
ring
?
And
oh
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
Jane
Andrews
told
me
that
Minnie
MacPherson
told
her
that
she
*NL*
heard
Prissy
Andrews
tell
Sara
Gillis
that
I
had
a
very
pretty
nose
.
*NL*
Marilla
,
that
is
the
first
compliment
I
have
ever
had
in
my
life
and
you
*NL*
ca
n't
imagine
what
a
strange
feeling
it
gave
me
.
Marilla
,
have
I
really
*NL*
a
pretty
nose
?
I
know
you
'll
tell
me
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
nose
is
well
enough
,
''
said
Marilla
shortly
.
Secretly
she
thought
*NL*
Anne
's
nose
was
a
remarkable
pretty
one
;
but
she
had
no
intention
of
*NL*
telling
her
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
three
weeks
ago
and
all
had
gone
smoothly
so
far
.
And
now
,
this
*NL*
crisp
September
morning
,
Anne
and
Diana
were
tripping
blithely
down
the
*NL*
Birch
Path
,
two
of
the
happiest
little
girls
in
Avonlea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
Gilbert
Blythe
will
be
in
school
today
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
He
's
been
*NL*
visiting
his
cousins
over
in
New
Brunswick
all
summer
and
he
only
came
*NL*
home
Saturday
night
.
He
's
AW
`
FLY
handsome
,
Anne
.
And
he
teases
the
girls
*NL*
something
terrible
.
He
just
torments
our
lives
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
's
voice
indicated
that
she
rather
liked
having
her
life
tormented
*NL*
out
than
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilbert
Blythe
?
''
said
Anne
.
``
Is
n't
his
name
that
's
written
up
on
the
*NL*
porch
wall
with
Julia
Bell
's
and
a
big
`
Take
Notice
'
over
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Diana
,
tossing
her
head
,
``
but
I
'm
sure
he
does
n't
like
Julia
*NL*
Bell
so
very
much
.
I
've
heard
him
say
he
studied
the
multiplication
*NL*
table
by
her
freckles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
speak
about
freckles
to
me
,
''
implored
Anne
.
``
It
is
n't
*NL*
delicate
when
I
've
got
so
many
.
But
I
do
think
that
writing
take-notices
*NL*
up
on
the
wall
about
the
boys
and
girls
is
the
silliest
ever
.
I
should
*NL*
just
like
to
see
anybody
dare
to
write
my
name
up
with
a
boy
's
.
Not
,
of
*NL*
course
,
''
she
hastened
to
add
,
``
that
anybody
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
.
She
did
n't
want
her
name
written
up
.
But
it
was
a
little
*NL*
humiliating
to
know
that
there
was
no
danger
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
said
Diana
,
whose
black
eyes
and
glossy
tresses
had
played
*NL*
such
havoc
with
the
hearts
of
Avonlea
schoolboys
that
her
name
figured
*NL*
on
the
porch
walls
in
half
a
dozen
take-notices
.
``
It
's
only
meant
as
*NL*
a
joke
.
And
do
n't
you
be
too
sure
your
name
wo
n't
ever
be
written
up
.
*NL*
Charlie
Sloane
is
DEAD
GONE
on
you
.
He
told
his
mother
--
his
MOTHER
,
mind
*NL*
you
--
that
you
were
the
smartest
girl
in
school
.
That
's
better
than
being
*NL*
good
looking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
n't
,
''
said
Anne
,
feminine
to
the
core
.
``
I
'd
rather
be
pretty
*NL*
than
clever

And
I
hate
Charlie
Sloane
,
I
ca
n't
bear
a
boy
with
goggle
*NL*
eyes

If
anyone
wrote

name
up

I
'd
never
GET
over
it

Diana
*NL*
Barry

But
it
IS
nice
to
keep

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
Gilbert
in
your
class
after
this
,

said
Diana
,
``
and
he
's
*NL*
used
to
being
head
of
his
class
,
I
can
tell
you
.
He
's
only
in
the
fourth
*NL*
book
although
he
's
nearly
fourteen

Four
years
ago
his
father
was
sick
*NL*
and
had
to
go
out
to
Alberta
for
his
health
and
Gilbert
went
with
him

They
were
there
three
years
and

did

go
to
school
hardly
any

came
back

said
Anne
quickly
.
``
I
could
n't
really
feel
proud
of
keeping
*NL*
head
of
little
boys
and
girls
of
just
nine
or
ten
.
I
got
up
yesterday
*NL*
spelling
`
ebullition
.
'
Josie
Pye
was
head
and
,
mind
you
,
she
peeped
*NL*
in
her
book
.
Mr.
Phillips
did
n't
see
her
--
he
was
looking
at
Prissy
*NL*
Andrews
--
but
I
did
.
I
just
swept
her
a
look
of
freezing
scorn
and
she
*NL*
got
as
red
as
a
beet
and
spelled
it
wrong
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
Pye
girls
are
cheats
all
round
,
''
said
Diana
indignantly
,
as
they
*NL*
climbed
the
fence
of
the
main
road
.
``
Gertie
Pye
actually
went
and
put
*NL*
her
milk
bottle
in
my
place
in
the
brook
yesterday
.
Did
you
ever
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
speak
to
her
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Phillips
was
in
the
back
of
the
room
hearing
Prissy
Andrews
's
*NL*
Latin
,
Diana
whispered
to
Anne
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Gilbert
Blythe
sitting
right
across
the
aisle
from
you
,
Anne
.
*NL*
Just
look
at
him
and
see
if
you
do
n't
think
he
's
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
looked
accordingly
.
She
had
a
good
chance
to
do
so
,
for
the
said
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
was
absorbed
in
stealthily
pinning
the
long
yellow
braid
*NL*
of
Ruby
Gillis
,
who
sat
in
front
of
him
,
to
the
back
of
her
seat
.
He
*NL*
was
a
tall
boy
,
with
curly
brown
hair
,
roguish
hazel
eyes
,
and
a
mouth
*NL*
twisted
into
a
teasing
smile
.
Presently
Ruby
Gillis
started
up
to
take
*NL*
a
sum
to
the
master
;
she
fell
back
into
her
seat
with
a
little
shriek
,
*NL*
believing
that
her
hair
was
pulled
out
by
the
roots
.
Everybody
looked
at
*NL*
her
and
Mr.
Phillips
glared
so
sternly
that
Ruby
began
to
cry
.
Gilbert
*NL*
had
whisked
the
pin
out
of
sight
and
was
studying
his
history
with
the
*NL*
soberest
face
in
the
world
;
but
when
the
commotion
subsided
he
looked
at
*NL*
Anne
and
winked
with
inexpressible
drollery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
your
Gilbert
Blythe
IS
handsome
,
''
confided
Anne
to
Diana
,
*NL*
``
but
I
think
he
's
very
bold
.
It
is
n't
good
manners
to
wink
at
a
strange
*NL*
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
that
things
really
began
to
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
was
back
in
the
corner
explaining
a
problem
in
algebra
to
*NL*
Prissy
Andrews
and
the
rest
of
the
scholars
were
doing
pretty
much
as
*NL*
they
pleased
eating
green
apples
,
whispering
,
drawing
pictures
on
their
*NL*
slates
,
and
driving
crickets
harnessed
to
strings
,
up
and
down
aisle
.
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
was
trying
to
make
Anne
Shirley
look
at
him
and
failing
*NL*
utterly
,
because
Anne
was
at
that
moment
totally
oblivious
not
only
*NL*
to
the
very
existence
of
Gilbert
Blythe
,
but
of
every
other
scholar
in
*NL*
Avonlea
school
itself
.
With
her
chin
propped
on
her
hands
and
her
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
blue
glimpse
of
the
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
that
the
west
*NL*
window
afforded
,
she
was
far
away
in
a
gorgeous
dreamland
hearing
and
*NL*
seeing
nothing
save
her
own
wonderful
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
was
n't
used
to
putting
himself
out
to
make
a
girl
look
*NL*
at
him
and
meeting
with
failure
.
She
SHOULD
look
at
him
,
that
red-haired
*NL*
Shirley
girl
with
the
little
pointed
chin
and
the
big
eyes
that
were
n't
*NL*
like
the
eyes
of
any
other
girl
in
Avonlea
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
reached
across
the
aisle
,
picked
up
the
end
of
Anne
's
long
red
*NL*
braid
,
held
it
out
at
arm
's
length
and
said
in
a
piercing
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrots
!
Carrots
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Anne
looked
at
him
with
a
vengeance
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
more
than
look
.
She
sprang
to
her
feet
,
her
bright
fancies
*NL*
fallen
into
cureless
ruin
.
She
flashed
one
indignant
glance
at
Gilbert
*NL*
from
eyes
whose
angry
sparkle
was
swiftly
quenched
in
equally
angry
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
hateful
boy
!
''
she
exclaimed
passionately
.
``
How
dare
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
--
thwack
!
Anne
had
brought
her
slate
down
on
Gilbert
's
head
and
*NL*
cracked
it
--
slate
not
head
--
clear
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avonlea
school
always
enjoyed
a
scene
.
This
was
an
especially
enjoyable
*NL*
one
.
Everybody
said
``
Oh
''
in
horrified
delight
.
Diana
gasped
.
Ruby
*NL*
Gillis
,
who
was
inclined
to
be
hysterical
,
began
to
cry
.
Tommy
*NL*
Sloane
let
his
team
of
crickets
escape
him
altogether
while
he
stared
*NL*
open-mouthed
at
the
tableau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
stalked
down
the
aisle
and
laid
his
hand
heavily
on
Anne
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
what
does
this
mean
?
''
he
said
angrily
.
Anne
returned
no
*NL*
answer
.
It
was
asking
too
much
of
flesh
and
blood
to
expect
her
to
tell
*NL*
before
the
whole
school
that
she
had
been
called
``
carrots
.
''
Gilbert
it
*NL*
was
who
spoke
up
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
fault
Mr.
Phillips
.
I
teased
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
paid
no
heed
to
Gilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
see
a
pupil
of
mine
displaying
such
a
temper
and
such
*NL*
a
vindictive
spirit
,
''
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
,
as
if
the
mere
fact
of
*NL*
being
a
pupil
of
his
ought
to
root
out
all
evil
passions
from
the
hearts
*NL*
of
small
imperfect
mortals
.
``
Anne
,
go
and
stand
on
the
platform
in
front
*NL*
of
the
blackboard
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
would
have
infinitely
preferred
a
whipping
to
this
punishment
under
*NL*
which
her
sensitive
spirit
quivered
as
from
a
whiplash
.
With
a
white
,
*NL*
set
face
she
obeyed
.
Mr.
Phillips
took
a
chalk
crayon
and
wrote
on
the
*NL*
blackboard
above
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ann
Shirley
has
a
very
bad
temper
.
Ann
Shirley
must
learn
to
control
*NL*
her
temper
,
''
and
then
read
it
out
loud
so
that
even
the
primer
class
,
*NL*
who
could
n't
read
writing
,
should
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
stood
there
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
with
that
legend
above
her
.
*NL*
She
did
not
cry
or
hang
her
head
.
Anger
was
still
too
hot
in
her
heart
*NL*
for
that
and
it
sustained
her
amid
all
her
agony
of
humiliation
.
With
*NL*
resentful
eyes
and
passion-red
cheeks
she
confronted
alike
Diana
's
*NL*
sympathetic
gaze
and
Charlie
Sloane
's
indignant
nods
and
Josie
Pye
's
*NL*
malicious
smiles
.
As
for
Gilbert
Blythe
,
she
would
not
even
look
at
him
.
*NL*
She
would
NEVER
look
at
him
again
!
She
would
never
speak
to
him
!!
*NL*
*NL*
When
school
was
dismissed
Anne
marched
out
with
her
red
head
held
high
.
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
tried
to
intercept
her
at
the
porch
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awfully
sorry
I
made
fun
of
your
hair
,
Anne
,
''
he
whispered
*NL*
contritely
.
``
Honest
I
am
.
Do
n't
be
mad
for
keeps
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
swept
by
disdainfully
,
without
look
or
sign
of
hearing
.
``
Oh
*NL*
how
could
you
,
Anne
?
''
breathed
Diana
as
they
went
down
the
road
half
*NL*
reproachfully
,
half
admiringly
.
Diana
felt
that
SHE
could
never
have
*NL*
resisted
Gilbert
's
plea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forgive
Gilbert
Blythe
,
''
said
Anne
firmly
.
``
And
Mr.
*NL*
Phillips
spelled
my
name
without
an
e
,
too
.
The
iron
has
entered
into
my
*NL*
soul
,
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
had
n't
the
least
idea
what
Anne
meant
but
she
understood
it
was
*NL*
something
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
mind
Gilbert
making
fun
of
your
hair
,
''
she
said
soothingly
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
makes
fun
of
all
the
girls
.
He
laughs
at
mine
because
it
's
*NL*
so
black
.
He
's
called
me
a
crow
a
dozen
times
;
and
I
never
heard
him
*NL*
apologize
for
anything
before
,
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
being
called
a
crow
and
*NL*
being
called
carrots
,
''
said
Anne
with
dignity
.
``
Gilbert
Blythe
has
hurt
*NL*
my
feelings
EXCRUCIATINGLY
,
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
the
matter
might
have
blown
over
without
more
*NL*
excruciation
if
nothing
else
had
happened
.
But
when
things
begin
to
*NL*
happen
they
are
apt
to
keep
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avonlea
scholars
often
spent
noon
hour
picking
gum
in
Mr.
Bell
's
spruce
*NL*
grove
over
the
hill
and
across
his
big
pasture
field
.
From
there
they
*NL*
could
keep
an
eye
on
Eben
Wright
's
house
,
where
the
master
boarded
.
When
*NL*
they
saw
Mr.
Phillips
emerging
therefrom
they
ran
for
the
schoolhouse
;
*NL*
but
the
distance
being
about
three
times
longer
than
Mr.
Wright
's
lane
*NL*
they
were
very
apt
to
arrive
there
,
breathless
and
gasping
,
some
three
*NL*
minutes
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
Mr.
Phillips
was
seized
with
one
of
his
spasmodic
*NL*
fits
of
reform
and
announced
before
going
home
to
dinner
,
that
he
should
*NL*
expect
to
find
all
the
scholars
in
their
seats
when
he
returned
.
Anyone
*NL*
who
came
in
late
would
be
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
boys
and
some
of
the
girls
went
to
Mr.
Bell
's
spruce
grove
as
*NL*
usual
,
fully
intending
to
stay
only
long
enough
to
``
pick
a
chew
.
''
But
*NL*
spruce
groves
are
seductive
and
yellow
nuts
of
gum
beguiling
;
they
*NL*
picked
and
loitered
and
strayed
;
and
as
usual
the
first
thing
that
*NL*
recalled
them
to
a
sense
of
the
flight
of
time
was
Jimmy
Glover
shouting
*NL*
from
the
top
of
a
patriarchal
old
spruce
``
Master
's
coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
who
were
on
the
ground
,
started
first
and
managed
to
reach
the
*NL*
schoolhouse
in
time
but
without
a
second
to
spare
.
The
boys
,
who
had
to
*NL*
wriggle
hastily
down
from
the
trees
,
were
later
;
and
Anne
,
who
had
not
*NL*
been
picking
gum
at
all
but
was
wandering
happily
in
the
far
end
of
the
*NL*
grove
,
waist
deep
among
the
bracken
,
singing
softly
to
herself
,
with
a
*NL*
wreath
of
rice
lilies
on
her
hair
as
if
she
were
some
wild
divinity
*NL*
of
the
shadowy
places
,
was
latest
of
all
.
Anne
could
run
like
a
deer
,
*NL*
however
;
run
she
did
with
the
impish
result
that
she
overtook
the
boys
*NL*
at
the
door
and
was
swept
into
the
schoolhouse
among
them
just
as
Mr.
*NL*
Phillips
was
in
the
act
of
hanging
up
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
's
brief
reforming
energy
was
over
;
he
did
n't
want
the
*NL*
bother
of
punishing
a
dozen
pupils
;
but
it
was
necessary
to
do
something
*NL*
to
save
his
word
,
so
he
looked
about
for
a
scapegoat
and
found
it
*NL*
in
Anne
,
who
had
dropped
into
her
seat
,
gasping
for
breath
,
with
a
*NL*
forgotten
lily
wreath
hanging
askew
over
one
ear
and
giving
her
a
*NL*
particularly
rakish
and
disheveled
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
since
you
seem
to
be
so
fond
of
the
boys
'
company
we
*NL*
shall
indulge
your
taste
for
it
this
afternoon
,
''
he
said
sarcastically
.
*NL*
``
Take
those
flowers
out
of
your
hair
and
sit
with
Gilbert
Blythe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
boys
snickered
.
Diana
,
turning
pale
with
pity
,
plucked
the
*NL*
wreath
from
Anne
's
hair
and
squeezed
her
hand
.
Anne
stared
at
the
master
*NL*
as
if
turned
to
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
what
I
said
,
Anne
?
''
queried
Mr.
Phillips
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Anne
slowly
``
but
I
did
n't
suppose
you
really
meant
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
I
did
''
--
still
with
the
sarcastic
inflection
which
all
the
*NL*
children
,
and
Anne
especially
,
hated
.
It
flicked
on
the
raw
.
``
Obey
me
at
*NL*
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Anne
looked
as
if
she
meant
to
disobey
.
Then
,
realizing
*NL*
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
she
rose
haughtily
,
stepped
across
the
*NL*
aisle
,
sat
down
beside
Gilbert
Blythe
,
and
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
*NL*
on
the
desk
.
Ruby
Gillis
,
who
got
a
glimpse
of
it
as
it
went
down
,
*NL*
told
the
others
going
home
from
school
that
she
'd
``
acksually
never
seen
*NL*
anything
like
it
--
it
was
so
white
,
with
awful
little
red
spots
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Anne
,
this
was
as
the
end
of
all
things
.
It
was
bad
enough
to
be
*NL*
singled
out
for
punishment
from
among
a
dozen
equally
guilty
ones
;
it
*NL*
was
worse
still
to
be
sent
to
sit
with
a
boy
,
but
that
that
boy
should
*NL*
be
Gilbert
Blythe
was
heaping
insult
on
injury
to
a
degree
utterly
*NL*
unbearable
.
Anne
felt
that
she
could
not
bear
it
and
it
would
be
of
*NL*
no
use
to
try
.
Her
whole
being
seethed
with
shame
and
anger
and
*NL*
humiliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
the
other
scholars
looked
and
whispered
and
giggled
and
nudged
.
*NL*
But
as
Anne
never
lifted
her
head
and
as
Gilbert
worked
fractions
as
if
*NL*
his
whole
soul
was
absorbed
in
them
and
them
only
,
they
soon
returned
*NL*
to
their
own
tasks
and
Anne
was
forgotten
.
When
Mr.
Phillips
called
the
*NL*
history
class
out
Anne
should
have
gone
,
but
Anne
did
not
move
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
,
who
had
been
writing
some
verses
``
To
Priscilla
''
before
he
*NL*
called
the
class
,
was
thinking
about
an
obstinate
rhyme
still
and
never
*NL*
missed
her
.
Once
,
when
nobody
was
looking
,
Gilbert
took
from
his
desk
*NL*
a
little
pink
candy
heart
with
a
gold
motto
on
it
,
``
You
are
sweet
,
''
and
*NL*
slipped
it
under
the
curve
of
Anne
's
arm
.
Whereupon
Anne
arose
,
took
the
*NL*
pink
heart
gingerly
between
the
tips
of
her
fingers
,
dropped
it
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
ground
it
to
powder
beneath
her
heel
,
and
resumed
her
position
*NL*
without
deigning
to
bestow
a
glance
on
Gilbert
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
school
went
out
Anne
marched
to
her
desk
,
ostentatiously
took
out
*NL*
everything
therein
,
books
and
writing
tablet
,
pen
and
ink
,
testament
and
*NL*
arithmetic
,
and
piled
them
neatly
on
her
cracked
slate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
taking
all
those
things
home
for
,
Anne
?
''
Diana
wanted
to
*NL*
know
,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
on
the
road
.
She
had
not
dared
to
ask
the
*NL*
question
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
coming
back
to
school
any
more
,
''
said
Anne
.
Diana
gasped
and
*NL*
stared
at
Anne
to
see
if
she
meant
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Marilla
let
you
stay
home
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
have
to
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
I
'll
NEVER
go
to
school
to
that
man
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
!
''
Diana
looked
as
if
she
were
ready
to
cry
.
``
I
do
think
you
're
*NL*
mean
.
What
shall
I
do
?
Mr.
Phillips
will
make
me
sit
with
that
horrid
*NL*
Gertie
Pye
--
I
know
he
will
because
she
is
sitting
alone
.
Do
come
back
,
*NL*
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
do
almost
anything
in
the
world
for
you
,
Diana
,
''
said
Anne
sadly
.
*NL*
``
I
'd
let
myself
be
torn
limb
from
limb
if
it
would
do
you
any
good
.
But
*NL*
I
ca
n't
do
this
,
so
please
do
n't
ask
it
.
You
harrow
up
my
very
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
think
of
all
the
fun
you
will
miss
,
''
mourned
Diana
.
``
We
are
going
*NL*
to
build
the
loveliest
new
house
down
by
the
brook
;
and
we
'll
be
playing
*NL*
ball
next
week
and
you
've
never
played
ball
,
Anne
.
It
's
tremendously
*NL*
exciting
.
And
we
're
going
to
learn
a
new
song
--
Jane
Andrews
is
*NL*
practicing
it
up
now
;
and
Alice
Andrews
is
going
to
bring
a
new
Pansy
*NL*
book
next
week
and
we
're
all
going
to
read
it
out
loud
,
chapter
about
,
*NL*
down
by
the
brook
.
And
you
know
you
are
so
fond
of
reading
out
loud
,
*NL*
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
moved
Anne
in
the
least
.
Her
mind
was
made
up
.
She
would
not
go
*NL*
to
school
to
Mr.
Phillips
again
;
she
told
Marilla
so
when
she
got
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
''
said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
nonsense
at
all
,
''
said
Anne
,
gazing
at
Marilla
with
solemn
,
*NL*
reproachful
eyes
.
``
Do
n't
you
understand
,
Marilla
?
I
've
been
insulted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Insulted
fiddlesticks
!
You
'll
go
to
school
tomorrow
as
usual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
Anne
shook
her
head
gently
.
``
I
'm
not
going
back
,
Marilla
.
I
'll
*NL*
learn
my
lessons
at
home
and
I
'll
be
as
good
as
I
can
be
and
hold
my
*NL*
tongue
all
the
time
if
it
's
possible
at
all
.
But
I
will
not
go
back
to
*NL*
school
,
I
assure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
saw
something
remarkably
like
unyielding
stubbornness
looking
*NL*
out
of
Anne
's
small
face
.
She
understood
that
she
would
have
trouble
in
*NL*
overcoming
it
;
but
she
re-solved
wisely
to
say
nothing
more
just
then
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
down
and
see
Rachel
about
it
this
evening
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
``
There
's
no
use
reasoning
with
Anne
now
.
She
's
too
worked
up
and
I
've
*NL*
an
idea
she
can
be
awful
stubborn
if
she
takes
the
notion
.
Far
as
I
can
*NL*
make
out
from
her
story
,
Mr.
Phillips
has
been
carrying
matters
with
a
*NL*
rather
high
hand
.
But
it
would
never
do
to
say
so
to
her
.
I
'll
just
talk
*NL*
it
over
with
Rachel
.
She
's
sent
ten
children
to
school
and
she
ought
to
*NL*
know
something
about
it
.
She
'll
have
heard
the
whole
story
,
too
,
by
this
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
found
Mrs.
Lynde
knitting
quilts
as
industriously
and
cheerfully
*NL*
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
know
what
I
've
come
about
,
''
she
said
,
a
little
*NL*
shamefacedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Anne
's
fuss
in
school
,
I
reckon
,
''
she
said
.
``
Tillie
Boulter
was
*NL*
in
on
her
way
home
from
school
and
told
me
about
it
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
do
with
her
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
She
declares
she
wo
n't
go
back
to
*NL*
school
.
I
never
saw
a
child
so
worked
up
.
I
've
been
expecting
trouble
*NL*
ever
since
she
started
to
school
.
I
knew
things
were
going
too
smooth
to
*NL*
last
.
She
's
so
high
strung
.
What
would
you
advise
,
Rachel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
since
you
've
asked
my
advice
,
Marilla
,
''
said
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
amiably
--
Mrs.
Lynde
dearly
loved
to
be
asked
for
advice
--
``
I
'd
just
*NL*
humor
her
a
little
at
first
,
that
's
what
I
'd
do
.
It
's
my
belief
that
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
was
in
the
wrong
.
Of
course
,
it
does
n't
do
to
say
so
to
the
*NL*
children
,
you
know
.
And
of
course
he
did
right
to
punish
her
yesterday
*NL*
for
giving
way
to
temper
.
But
today
it
was
different
.
The
others
who
*NL*
were
late
should
have
been
punished
as
well
as
Anne
,
that
's
what
.
And
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
in
making
the
girls
sit
with
the
boys
for
punishment
.
It
*NL*
is
n't
modest
.
Tillie
Boulter
was
real
indignant
.
She
took
Anne
's
part
*NL*
right
through
and
said
all
the
scholars
did
too
.
Anne
seems
real
popular
*NL*
among
them
,
somehow
.
I
never
thought
she
'd
take
with
them
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
really
think
I
'd
better
let
her
stay
home
,
''
said
Marilla
in
*NL*
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
That
is
I
would
n't
say
school
to
her
again
until
she
said
it
*NL*
herself
.
Depend
upon
it
,
Marilla
,
she
'll
cool
off
in
a
week
or
so
and
*NL*
be
ready
enough
to
go
back
of
her
own
accord
,
that
's
what
,
while
,
if
*NL*
you
were
to
make
her
go
back
right
off
,
dear
knows
what
freak
or
tantrum
*NL*
she
'd
take
next
and
make
more
trouble
than
ever
.
The
less
fuss
made
the
*NL*
better
,
in
my
opinion
.
She
wo
n't
miss
much
by
not
going
to
school
,
as
*NL*
far
as
THAT
goes
.
Mr.
Phillips
is
n't
any
good
at
all
as
a
teacher
.
The
*NL*
order
he
keeps
is
scandalous
,
that
's
what
,
and
he
neglects
the
young
*NL*
fry
and
puts
all
his
time
on
those
big
scholars
he
's
getting
ready
for
*NL*
Queen
's
.
He
'd
never
have
got
the
school
for
another
year
if
his
uncle
*NL*
had
n't
been
a
trustee
--
THE
trustee
,
for
he
just
leads
the
other
two
*NL*
around
by
the
nose
,
that
's
what
.
I
declare
,
I
do
n't
know
what
education
*NL*
in
this
Island
is
coming
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
shook
her
head
,
as
much
as
to
say
if
she
were
only
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
educational
system
of
the
Province
things
would
be
much
*NL*
better
managed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
took
Mrs.
Rachel
's
advice
and
not
another
word
was
said
to
Anne
*NL*
about
going
back
to
school
.
She
learned
her
lessons
at
home
,
did
her
*NL*
chores
,
and
played
with
Diana
in
the
chilly
purple
autumn
twilights
;
*NL*
but
when
she
met
Gilbert
Blythe
on
the
road
or
encountered
him
in
Sunday
*NL*
school
she
passed
him
by
with
an
icy
contempt
that
was
no
whit
thawed
by
*NL*
his
evident
desire
to
appease
her
.
Even
Diana
's
efforts
as
a
peacemaker
*NL*
were
of
no
avail
.
Anne
had
evidently
made
up
her
mind
to
hate
Gilbert
*NL*
Blythe
to
the
end
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
much
as
she
hated
Gilbert
,
however
,
did
she
love
Diana
,
with
all
the
*NL*
love
of
her
passionate
little
heart
,
equally
intense
in
its
likes
and
*NL*
dislikes
.
One
evening
Marilla
,
coming
in
from
the
orchard
with
a
basket
*NL*
of
apples
,
found
Anne
sitting
along
by
the
east
window
in
the
twilight
,
*NL*
crying
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
's
the
matter
now
,
Anne
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
about
Diana
,
''
sobbed
Anne
luxuriously
.
``
I
love
Diana
so
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
I
can
not
ever
live
without
her
.
But
I
know
very
well
when
we
grow
up
*NL*
that
Diana
will
get
married
and
go
away
and
leave
me
.
And
oh
,
what
shall
*NL*
I
do
?
I
hate
her
husband
--
I
just
hate
him
furiously
.
I
've
been
imagining
*NL*
it
all
out
--
the
wedding
and
everything
--
Diana
dressed
in
snowy
garments
,
*NL*
with
a
veil
,
and
looking
as
beautiful
and
regal
as
a
queen
;
and
me
the
*NL*
bridesmaid
,
with
a
lovely
dress
too
,
and
puffed
sleeves
,
but
with
a
*NL*
breaking
heart
hid
beneath
my
smiling
face
.
And
then
bidding
Diana
*NL*
goodbye-e-e
--
''
Here
Anne
broke
down
entirely
and
wept
with
increasing
*NL*
bitterness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
turned
quickly
away
to
hide
her
twitching
face
;
but
it
was
no
*NL*
use
;
she
collapsed
on
the
nearest
chair
and
burst
into
such
a
hearty
and
*NL*
unusual
peal
of
laughter
that
Matthew
,
crossing
the
yard
outside
,
halted
*NL*
in
amazement
.
When
had
he
heard
Marilla
laugh
like
that
before
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Anne
Shirley
,
''
said
Marilla
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
,
``
if
you
*NL*
must
borrow
trouble
,
for
pity
's
sake
borrow
it
handier
home

I
should

think
you
had
an
imagination
,
sure
enough

CHAPTER
XVI
.
Diana
Is
Invited
to
Tea
with
Tragic
Results
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
OCTOBER
was
a
beautiful
month
at
Green
Gables
,
when
the
birches
in
the
*NL*
hollow
turned
as
golden
as
sunshine
and
the
maples
behind
the
orchard
*NL*
were
royal
crimson
and
the
wild
cherry
trees
along
the
lane
put
on
the
*NL*
loveliest
shades
of
dark
red
and
bronzy
green
,
while
the
fields
sunned
*NL*
themselves
in
aftermaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
reveled
in
the
world
of
color
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
she
exclaimed
one
Saturday
morning
,
coming
dancing
in
*NL*
with
her
arms
full
of
gorgeous
boughs
,
``
I
'm
so
glad
I
live
in
a
world
*NL*
where
there
are
Octobers
.
It
would
be
terrible
if
we
just
skipped
from
*NL*
September
to
November
,
would
n't
it
?
Look
at
these
maple
branches
.
Do
n't
*NL*
they
give
you
a
thrill
--
several
thrills
?
I
'm
going
to
decorate
my
room
*NL*
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Messy
things
,
''
said
Marilla
,
whose
aesthetic
sense
was
not
noticeably
*NL*
developed
.
``
You
clutter
up
your
room
entirely
too
much
with
out-of-doors
*NL*
stuff

Anne
.
Bedrooms
were
made
to
sleep
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
and
dream
in
too
,
Marilla
.
And
you
know
one
can
dream
so
much
*NL*
better
in
a
room
where
there
are
pretty
things
.
I
'm
going
to
put
these
*NL*
boughs
in
the
old
blue
jug
and
set
them
on
my
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
you
do
n't
drop
leaves
all
over
the
stairs
then
.
I
'm
going
on
a
*NL*
meeting
of
the
Aid
Society
at
Carmody
this
afternoon
,
Anne
,
and
I
wo
n't
*NL*
likely
be
home
before
dark
.
You
'll
have
to
get
Matthew
and
Jerry
their
*NL*
supper
,
so
mind
you
do
n't
forget
to
put
the
tea
to
draw
until
you
sit
*NL*
down
at
the
table
as
you
did
last
time
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
dreadful
of
me
to
forget
,

said
Anne
apologetically
,
``
but
that
*NL*
was
the
afternoon
I
was
trying
to
think
of
a
name
for
Violet
Vale
and
it
*NL*
crowded
other
things
out
.
Matthew
was
so
good
.
He
never
scolded
a
bit
.
*NL*
He
put
the
tea
down
himself
and
said
we
could
wait
awhile
as
well
as
*NL*
not
.
And
I
told
him
a
lovely
fairy
story
while
we
were
waiting
,
so
*NL*
he
did
n't
find
the
time
long
at
all
.
It
was
a
beautiful
fairy
story
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
I
forgot
the
end
of
it
,
so
I
made
up
an
end
for
it
myself
and
*NL*
Matthew
said
he
could
n't
tell
where
the
join
came
in
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
would
think
it
all
right

you
took
a
notion
to
get
up
*NL*
and
have
dinner
in
the
middle
of
the
night

But
you
keep
your
wits
about
*NL*
you
this
time

And
--
I
do
n't
really
know
if
I
'm
doing
right

it
may
make
*NL*
you
more
addlepated
than
ever

you
can
ask
Diana
to
come
over
and

spend
the
afternoon
with
you

have
tea
here

How
perfectly
lovely
!
You
ARE
*NL*
able
to
imagine
things
after
all
or
else
you
'd
never
have
understood
how
*NL*
I
've
longed
for
that
very
thing
.
It
will
seem
so
nice
and
grown-uppish
.
*NL*
No
fear
of
my
forgetting
to
put
the
tea
to
draw
when
I
have
company
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
can
I
use
the
rosebud
spray
tea
set
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
!
The
rosebud
tea
set
!
Well
,
what
next
?
You
know
I
never
use
*NL*
that
except
for
the
minister
or
the
Aids
.
You
'll
put
down
the
old
brown
*NL*
tea
set
.
But
you
can
open
the
little
yellow
crock
of
cherry
preserves
.
*NL*
It
's
time
it
was
being
used
anyhow
--
I
believe
it
's
beginning
to
work
.
*NL*
And
you
can
cut
some
fruit
cake
and
have
some
of
the
cookies
and
snaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
just
imagine
myself
sitting
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
*NL*
pouring
out
the
tea
,
''
said
Anne
,
shutting
her
eyes
ecstatically
.
``
And
*NL*
asking
Diana
if
she
takes
sugar
!
I
know
she
does
n't
but
of
course
I
'll
*NL*
ask
her
just
as
if
I
did
n't
know
.
And
then
pressing
her
to
take
another
*NL*
piece
of
fruit
cake
and
another
helping
of
preserves
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
's
*NL*
a
wonderful
sensation
just
to
think
of
it
.
Can
I
take
her
into
the
spare
*NL*
room
to
lay
off
her
hat
when
she
comes
?
And
then
into
the
parlor
to
*NL*
sit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
The
sitting
room
will
do
for
you
and
your
company
.
But
there
's
a
*NL*
bottle
half
full
of
raspberry
cordial
that
was
left
over
from
the
church
*NL*
social
the
other
night
.
It
's
on
the
second
shelf
of
the
sitting-room
*NL*
closet
and
you
and
Diana
can
have
it
if
you
like
,
and
a
cooky
to
eat
*NL*
with
it
along
in
the
afternoon
,
for
I
daresay
Matthew
'll
be
late
coming
*NL*
in
to
tea
since
he
's
hauling
potatoes
to
the
vessel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
flew
down
to
the
hollow
,
past
the
Dryad
's
Bubble
and
up
the
spruce
*NL*
path
to
Orchard
Slope
,
to
ask
Diana
to
tea
.
As
a
result
just
after
*NL*
Marilla
had
driven
off
to
Carmody
,
Diana
came
over
,
dressed
in
HER
*NL*
second-best
dress
and
looking
exactly
as
it
is
proper
to
look
when
asked
*NL*
out
to
tea
.
At
other
times
she
was
wont
to
run
into
the
kitchen
without
*NL*
knocking
;
but
now
she
knocked
primly
at
the
front
door
.
And
when
Anne
,
*NL*
dressed
in
her
second
best
,
as
primly
opened
it
,
both
little
girls
*NL*
shook
hands
as
gravely
as
if
they
had
never
met
before
.
This
unnatural
*NL*
solemnity
lasted
until
after
Diana
had
been
taken
to
the
east
gable
to
*NL*
lay
off
her
hat
and
then
had
sat
for
ten
minutes
in
the
sitting
room
,
*NL*
toes
in
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your
mother
?
''
inquired
Anne
politely
,
just
as
if
she
had
not
*NL*
seen
Mrs.
Barry
picking
apples
that
morning
in
excellent
health
and
*NL*
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
very
well
,
thank
you
.
I
suppose
Mr.
Cuthbert
is
hauling
potatoes
*NL*
to
the
LILY
SANDS
this
afternoon
,
is
he
?
''
said
Diana
,
who
had
ridden
*NL*
down
to
Mr.
Harmon
Andrews
's
that
morning
in
Matthew
's
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Our
potato
crop
is
very
good
this
year
.
I
hope
your
father
's
crop
*NL*
is
good
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
fairly
good
,
thank
you
.
Have
you
picked
many
of
your
apples
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ever
so
many
,
''
said
Anne
forgetting
to
be
dignified
and
jumping
up
*NL*
quickly
.
``
Let
's
go
out
to
the
orchard
and
get
some
of
the
Red
Sweetings
,
*NL*
Diana
.
Marilla
says
we
can
have
all
that
are
left
on
the
tree
.
Marilla
*NL*
is
a
very
generous
woman
.
She
said
we
could
have
fruit
cake
and
cherry
*NL*
preserves
for
tea
.
But
it
is
n't
good
manners
to
tell
your
company
what
*NL*
you
are
going
to
give
them
to
eat
,
so
I
wo
n't
tell
you
what
she
said
we
*NL*
could
have
to
drink
.
Only
it
begins
with
an
R
and
a
C
and
it
's
bright
*NL*
red
color
.
I
love
bright
red
drinks
,
do
n't
you
?
They
taste
twice
as
good
*NL*
as
any
other
color
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
orchard
,
with
its
great
sweeping
boughs
that
bent
to
the
ground
*NL*
with
fruit
,
proved
so
delightful
that
the
little
girls
spent
most
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
in
it
,
sitting
in
a
grassy
corner
where
the
frost
had
spared
*NL*
the
green
and
the
mellow
autumn
sunshine
lingered
warmly
,
eating
apples
*NL*
and
talking
as
hard
as
they
could
.
Diana
had
much
to
tell
Anne
of
what
*NL*
went
on
in
school
.
She
had
to
sit
with
Gertie
Pye
and
she
hated
*NL*
it
;
Gertie
squeaked
her
pencil
all
the
time
and
it
just
made
*NL*
her
--
Diana
's
--
blood
run
cold
;
Ruby
Gillis
had
charmed
all
her
warts
*NL*
away
,
true
's
you
live
,
with
a
magic
pebble
that
old
Mary
Joe
from
the
*NL*
Creek
gave
her
.
You
had
to
rub
the
warts
with
the
pebble
and
then
throw
*NL*
it
away
over
your
left
shoulder
at
the
time
of
the
new
moon
and
the
*NL*
warts
would
all
go
.
Charlie
Sloane
's
name
was
written
up
with
Em
White
's
*NL*
on
the
porch
wall
and
Em
White
was
AWFUL
MAD
about
it
;
Sam
Boulter
had
*NL*
``
sassed
''
Mr.
Phillips
in
class
and
Mr.
Phillips
whipped
him
and
Sam
's
*NL*
father
came
down
to
the
school
and
dared
Mr.
Phillips
to
lay
a
hand
on
*NL*
one
of
his
children
again
;
and
Mattie
Andrews
had
a
new
red
hood
and
a
*NL*
blue
crossover
with
tassels
on
it
and
the
airs
she
put
on
about
it
were
*NL*
perfectly
sickening
;
and
Lizzie
Wright
did
n't
speak
to
Mamie
Wilson
*NL*
because
Mamie
Wilson
's
grown-up
sister
had
cut
out
Lizzie
Wright
's
*NL*
grown-up
sister
with
her
beau
;
and
everybody
missed
Anne
so
and
wished
*NL*
she
's
come
to
school
again
;
and
Gilbert
Blythe
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
Anne
did
n't
want
to
hear
about
Gilbert
Blythe
.
She
jumped
up
*NL*
hurriedly
and
said
suppose
they
go
in
and
have
some
raspberry
cordial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
looked
on
the
second
shelf
of
the
room
pantry
but
there
was
no
*NL*
bottle
of
raspberry
cordial
there
.
Search
revealed
it
away
back
on
the
*NL*
top
shelf
.
Anne
put
it
on
a
tray
and
set
it
on
the
table
with
a
tumbler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
please
help
yourself
,
Diana
,
''
she
said
politely
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
I
'll
have
any
just
now
.
I
do
n't
feel
as
if
I
wanted
any
after
all
those
*NL*
apples
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
poured
herself
out
a
tumblerful
,
looked
at
its
bright-red
hue
*NL*
admiringly
,
and
then
sipped
it
daintily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
awfully
nice
raspberry
cordial
,
Anne
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
raspberry
cordial
was
so
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
real
glad
you
like
it
.
Take
as
much
as
you
want
.
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
run
out
and
stir
the
fire
up
.
There
are
so
many
responsibilities
on
a
*NL*
person
's
mind
when
they
're
keeping
house
,
is
n't
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anne
came
back
from
the
kitchen
Diana
was
drinking
her
second
*NL*
glassful
of
cordial
;
and
,
being
entreated
thereto
by
Anne
,
she
offered
*NL*
no
particular
objection
to
the
drinking
of
a
third
.
The
tumblerfuls
were
*NL*
generous
ones
and
the
raspberry
cordial
was
certainly
very
nice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nicest
I
ever
drank
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
It
's
ever
so
much
nicer
than
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
's
,
although
she
brags
of
hers
so
much
.
It
does
n't
taste
a
bit
*NL*
like
hers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
Marilla
's
raspberry
cordial
would
prob
`
ly
be
much
nicer
*NL*
than
Mrs.
Lynde
's
,
''
said
Anne
loyally
.
``
Marilla
is
a
famous
cook
.
She
is
*NL*
trying
to
teach
me
to
cook
but
I
assure
you
,
Diana
,
it
is
uphill
work
.
*NL*
There
's
so
little
scope
for
imagination
in
cookery
.
You
just
have
to
go
*NL*
by
rules
.
The
last
time
I
made
a
cake
I
forgot
to
put
the
flour
in
.
I
*NL*
was
thinking
the
loveliest
story
about
you
and
me
,
Diana
.
I
thought
you
*NL*
were
desperately
ill
with
smallpox
and
everybody
deserted
you
,
but
I
*NL*
went
boldly
to
your
bedside
and
nursed
you
back
to
life
;
and
then
I
took
*NL*
the
smallpox
and
died
and
I
was
buried
under
those
poplar
trees
in
the
*NL*
graveyard
and
you
planted
a
rosebush
by
my
grave
and
watered
it
with
*NL*
your
tears
;
and
you
never
,
never
forgot
the
friend
of
your
youth
who
*NL*
sacrificed
her
life
for
you
.
Oh
,
it
was
such
a
pathetic
tale
,
Diana
.
*NL*
The
tears
just
rained
down
over
my
cheeks
while
I
mixed
the
cake
.
But
*NL*
I
forgot
the
flour
and
the
cake
was
a
dismal
failure
.
Flour
is
so
*NL*
essential
to
cakes
,
you
know
.
Marilla
was
very
cross
and
I
do
n't
wonder
.
*NL*
I
'm
a
great
trial
to
her
.
She
was
terribly
mortified
about
the
pudding
*NL*
sauce
last
week
.
We
had
a
plum
pudding
for
dinner
on
Tuesday
and
there
*NL*
was
half
the
pudding
and
a
pitcherful
of
sauce
left
over
.
Marilla
said
*NL*
there
was
enough
for
another
dinner
and
told
me
to
set
it
on
the
pantry
*NL*
shelf
and
cover
it
.
I
meant
to
cover
it
just
as
much
as
could
be
,
Diana
,
*NL*
but
when
I
carried
it
in
I
was
imagining
I
was
a
nun
--
of
course
I
'm
a
*NL*
Protestant
but
I
imagined
I
was
a
Catholic
--
taking
the
veil
to
bury
a
*NL*
broken
heart
in
cloistered
seclusion
;
and
I
forgot
all
about
covering
*NL*
the
pudding
sauce
.
I
thought
of
it
next
morning
and
ran
to
the
pantry
.
*NL*
Diana
,
fancy
if
you
can
my
extreme
horror
at
finding
a
mouse
drowned
in
*NL*
that
pudding
sauce
!
I
lifted
the
mouse
out
with
a
spoon
and
threw
it
out
*NL*
in
the
yard
and
then
I
washed
the
spoon
in
three
waters
.
Marilla
was
out
*NL*
milking
and
I
fully
intended
to
ask
her
when
she
came
in
if
I
'd
give
the
*NL*
sauce
to
the
pigs
;
but
when
she
did
come
in
I
was
imagining
that
I
was
*NL*
a
frost
fairy
going
through
the
woods
turning
the
trees
red
and
yellow
,
*NL*
whichever
they
wanted
to
be
,
so
I
never
thought
about
the
pudding
sauce
*NL*
again
and
Marilla
sent
me
out
to
pick
apples
.
Well
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Chester
*NL*
Ross
from
Spencervale
came
here
that
morning
.
You
know
they
are
very
*NL*
stylish
people
,
especially
Mrs.
Chester
Ross
.
When
Marilla
called
me
in
*NL*
dinner
was
all
ready
and
everybody
was
at
the
table
.
I
tried
to
be
as
*NL*
polite
and
dignified
as
I
could
be
,
for
I
wanted
Mrs.
Chester
Ross
to
*NL*
think
I
was
a
ladylike
little
girl
even
if
I
was
n't
pretty
.
Everything
*NL*
went
right
until
I
saw
Marilla
coming
with
the
plum
pudding
in
one
hand
*NL*
and
the
pitcher
of
pudding
sauce
WARMED
UP
,
in
the
other
.
Diana
,
that
*NL*
was
a
terrible
moment
.
I
remembered
everything
and
I
just
stood
up
in
*NL*
my
place
and
shrieked
out
`
Marilla
,
you
must
n't
use
that
pudding
sauce
.
*NL*
There
was
a
mouse
drowned
in
it
.
I
forgot
to
tell
you
before
.
'
Oh
,
*NL*
Diana
,
I
shall
never
forget
that
awful
moment
if
I
live
to
be
a
hundred
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Chester
Ross
just
LOOKED
at
me
and
I
thought
I
would
sink
through
*NL*
the
floor
with
mortification
.
She
is
such
a
perfect
housekeeper
and
*NL*
fancy
what
she
must
have
thought
of
us
.
Marilla
turned
red
as
fire
but
*NL*
she
never
said
a
word
--
then
.
She
just
carried
that
sauce
and
pudding
out
*NL*
and
brought
in
some
strawberry
preserves
.
She
even
offered
me
some
,
but
*NL*
I
could
n't
swallow
a
mouthful
.
It
was
like
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
*NL*
my
head
.
After
Mrs.
Chester
Ross
went
away
,
Marilla
gave
me
a
dreadful
*NL*
scolding
.
Why
,
Diana
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
had
stood
up
very
unsteadily
;
then
she
sat
down
again
,
putting
her
*NL*
hands
to
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
--
I
'm
awful
sick
,
''
she
said
,
a
little
thickly
.
``
I
--
I
--
must
go
right
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
n't
dream
of
going
home
without
your
tea
,
''
cried
Anne
in
*NL*
distress
.
``
I
'll
get
it
right
off
--
I
'll
go
and
put
the
tea
down
this
very
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
home
,
''
repeated
Diana
,
stupidly
but
determinedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
get
you
a
lunch
anyhow
,
''
implored
Anne
.
``
Let
me
give
you
a
bit
*NL*
of
fruit
cake
and
some
of
the
cherry
preserves
.
Lie
down
on
the
sofa
for
*NL*
a
little
while
and
you
'll
be
better
.
Where
do
you
feel
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
home
,
''
said
Diana
,
and
that
was
all
she
would
say
.
In
vain
*NL*
Anne
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
heard
of
company
going
home
without
tea
,
''
she
mourned
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Diana
,
do
you
suppose
that
it
's
possible
you
're
really
taking
the
*NL*
smallpox
?
If
you
are
I
'll
go
and
nurse
you
,
you
can
depend
on
that
.
I
'll
*NL*
never
forsake
you
.
But
I
do
wish
you
'd
stay
till
after
tea
.
Where
do
you
*NL*
feel
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awful
dizzy
,
''
said
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
indeed
,
she
walked
very
dizzily
.
Anne
,
with
tears
of
disappointment
*NL*
in
her
eyes
,
got
Diana
's
hat
and
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
Barry
*NL*
yard
fence
.
Then
she
wept
all
the
way
back
to
Green
Gables
,
where
she
*NL*
sorrowfully
put
the
remainder
of
the
raspberry
cordial
back
into
the
*NL*
pantry
and
got
tea
ready
for
Matthew
and
Jerry
,
with
all
the
zest
gone
*NL*
out
of
the
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
Sunday
and
as
the
rain
poured
down
in
torrents
from
*NL*
dawn
till
dusk
Anne
did
not
stir
abroad
from
Green
Gables
.
Monday
*NL*
afternoon
Marilla
sent
her
down
to
Mrs.
Lynde
's
on
an
errand
.
In
a
very
*NL*
short
space
of
time
Anne
came
flying
back
up
the
lane
with
tears
rolling
*NL*
down
her
cheeks
.
Into
the
kitchen
she
dashed
and
flung
herself
face
*NL*
downward
on
the
sofa
in
an
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
has
gone
wrong
now
,
Anne
?
''
queried
Marilla
in
doubt
and
*NL*
dismay
.
``
I
do
hope
you
have
n't
gone
and
been
saucy
to
Mrs.
Lynde
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
from
Anne
save
more
tears
and
stormier
sobs
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
when
I
ask
you
a
question
I
want
to
be
answered
.
Sit
*NL*
right
up
this
very
minute
and
tell
me
what
you
are
crying
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sat
up
,
tragedy
personified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Lynde
was
up
to
see
Mrs.
Barry
today
and
Mrs.
Barry
was
in
an
*NL*
awful
state
,
''
she
wailed
.
``
She
says
that
I
set
Diana
DRUNK
Saturday
*NL*
and
sent
her
home
in
a
disgraceful
condition
.
And
she
says
I
must
be
a
*NL*
thoroughly
bad
,
wicked
little
girl
and
she
's
never
,
never
going
to
let
*NL*
Diana
play
with
me
again
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
'm
just
overcome
with
woe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
stared
in
blank
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
Diana
drunk
!
''
she
said
when
she
found
her
voice
.
``
Anne
are
you
or
*NL*
Mrs.
Barry
crazy
?
What
on
earth
did
you
give
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
thing
but
raspberry
cordial
,
''
sobbed
Anne
.
``
I
never
thought
*NL*
raspberry
cordial
would
set
people
drunk
,
Marilla
--
not
even
if
they
*NL*
drank
three
big
tumblerfuls
as
Diana
did
.
Oh
,
it
sounds
so
--
so
--
like
*NL*
Mrs.
Thomas
's
husband
!
But
I
did
n't
mean
to
set
her
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drunk
fiddlesticks
!
''
said
Marilla
,
marching
to
the
sitting
room
pantry
.
*NL*
There
on
the
shelf
was
a
bottle
which
she
at
once
recognized
as
one
*NL*
containing
some
of
her
three-year-old
homemade
currant
wine
for
which
*NL*
she
was
celebrated
in
Avonlea
,
although
certain
of
the
stricter
sort
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Barry
among
them
,
disapproved
strongly
of
it
.
And
at
the
same
time
*NL*
Marilla
recollected
that
she
had
put
the
bottle
of
raspberry
cordial
*NL*
down
in
the
cellar
instead
of
in
the
pantry
as
she
had
told
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
back
to
the
kitchen
with
the
wine
bottle
in
her
hand
.
Her
face
*NL*
was
twitching
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
you
certainly
have
a
genius
for
getting
into
trouble
.
You
went
*NL*
and
gave
Diana
currant
wine
instead
of
raspberry
cordial
.
Did
n't
you
*NL*
know
the
difference
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
tasted
it
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
I
thought
it
was
the
cordial
.
I
meant
*NL*
to
be
so
--
so
--
hospitable
.
Diana
got
awfully
sick
and
had
to
go
home
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Barry
told
Mrs.
Lynde
she
was
simply
dead
drunk
.
She
just
laughed
*NL*
silly-like
when
her
mother
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
and
went
to
*NL*
sleep
and
slept
for
hours
.
Her
mother
smelled
her
breath
and
knew
she
*NL*
was
drunk
.
She
had
a
fearful
headache
all
day
yesterday
.
Mrs.
Barry
is
*NL*
so
indignant
.
She
will
never
believe
but
what
I
did
it
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
she
would
better
punish
Diana
for
being
so
greedy
as
to
*NL*
drink
three
glassfuls
of
anything
,
''
said
Marilla
shortly
.
``
Why
,
three
*NL*
of
those
big
glasses
would
have
made
her
sick
even
if
it
had
only
been
*NL*
cordial
.
Well
,
this
story
will
be
a
nice
handle
for
those
folks
who
are
*NL*
so
down
on
me
for
making
currant
wine
,
although
I
have
n't
made
any
for
*NL*
three
years
ever
since
I
found
out
that
the
minister
did
n't
approve
.
I
*NL*
just
kept
that
bottle
for
sickness

There
,
there
,
child
,
do
n't
cry

I
*NL*
ca
n't
see
as
you
were
to
blame

I
'm
sorry
it
happened
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
cry
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
My
heart
is
broken

The
stars
in
their
courses
*NL*
fight
against
me

Marilla

Diana

I
are
parted
forever

Oh
,
Marilla

*NL*
I
little
dreamed
of
this
when
first
we
swore
our
vows
of
friendship

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

Anne

Mrs.
Barry
will
think
better
of
it
when
she
*NL*
finds
you

not
to
blame
.
I
suppose
she
thinks
you
've
done
it
for
a
*NL*
silly
joke
or
something
of
that
sort
.
You
'd
best
go
up
this
evening
and
*NL*
tell
her
how
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
courage
fails
me
at
the
thought
of
facing
Diana
's
injured
mother
,
''
*NL*
sighed
Anne
.
``
I
wish
you
'd
go

Marilla
.
You
're
so
much
more
dignified
*NL*
than
I
am

Likely
she
'd
listen
to
you
quicker
than
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
will
,
''
said
Marilla
,
reflecting
that
it
would
probably
be
the
*NL*
wiser
course
.
``
Do
n't
cry
any
more
,
Anne
.
It
will
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
changed
her
mind
about
it
being
all
right
by
the
time
she
*NL*
got
back
from
Orchard
Slope
.
Anne
was
watching
for
her
coming
and
flew
*NL*
to
the
porch
door
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
know
by
your
face
that
it
's
been
no
use
,
''
she
said
*NL*
sorrowfully
.
``
Mrs.
Barry
wo
n't
forgive
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Barry
indeed
!
''
snapped
Marilla
.
``
Of
all
the
unreasonable
women
*NL*
I
ever
saw
she
's
the
worst
.
I
told
her
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
you
*NL*
were
n't
to
blame
,
but
she
just
simply
did
n't
believe
me
.
And
she
rubbed
*NL*
it
well
in
about
my
currant
wine
and
how
I
'd
always
said
it
could
n't
*NL*
have
the
least
effect
on
anybody
.
I
just
told
her
plainly
that
currant
*NL*
wine
was
n't
meant
to
be
drunk
three
tumblerfuls
at
a
time
and
that
if
a
*NL*
child
I
had
to
do
with
was
so
greedy
I
'd
sober
her
up
with
a
right
good
*NL*
spanking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
whisked
into
the
kitchen
,
grievously
disturbed
,
leaving
a
very
*NL*
much
distracted
little
soul
in
the
porch
behind
her
.
Presently
Anne
*NL*
stepped
out
bareheaded
into
the
chill
autumn
dusk
;
very
determinedly
and
*NL*
steadily
she
took
her
way
down
through
the
sere
clover
field
over
the
*NL*
log
bridge
and
up
through
the
spruce
grove
,
lighted
by
a
pale
little
*NL*
moon
hanging
low
over
the
western
woods
.
Mrs.
Barry
,
coming
to
the
door
*NL*
in
answer
to
a
timid
knock
,
found
a
white-lipped
eager-eyed
suppliant
on
*NL*
the
doorstep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
hardened
.
Mrs.
Barry
was
a
woman
of
strong
prejudices
and
*NL*
dislikes
,
and
her
anger
was
of
the
cold
,
sullen
sort
which
is
always
*NL*
hardest
to
overcome
.
To
do
her
justice
,
she
really
believed
Anne
had
*NL*
made
Diana
drunk
out
of
sheer
malice
prepense
,
and
she
was
honestly
*NL*
anxious
to
preserve
her
little
daughter
from
the
contamination
of
*NL*
further
intimacy
with
such
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
said
stiffly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mrs.
Barry
,
please
forgive
me
.
I
did
not
mean
to
--
to
--
intoxicate
*NL*
Diana
.
How
could
I
?
Just
imagine
if
you
were
a
poor
little
orphan
girl
*NL*
that
kind
people
had
adopted
and
you
had
just
one
bosom
friend
in
all
*NL*
the
world
.
Do
you
think
you
would
intoxicate
her
on
purpose
?
I
thought
*NL*
it
was
only
raspberry
cordial
.
I
was
firmly
convinced
it
was
raspberry
*NL*
cordial
.
Oh
,
please
do
n't
say
that
you
wo
n't
let
Diana
play
with
me
any
*NL*
more
.
If
you
do
you
will
cover
my
life
with
a
dark
cloud
of
woe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
speech
which
would
have
softened
good
Mrs.
Lynde
's
heart
in
a
*NL*
twinkling
,
had
no
effect
on
Mrs.
Barry
except
to
irritate
her
still
*NL*
more
.
She
was
suspicious
of
Anne
's
big
words
and
dramatic
gestures
and
*NL*
imagined
that
the
child
was
making
fun
of
her
.
So
she
said
,
coldly
and
*NL*
cruelly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
are
a
fit
little
girl
for
Diana
to
associate
with
.
*NL*
You
'd
better
go
home
and
behave
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
lips
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
let
me
see
Diana
just
once
to
say
farewell
?
''
she
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diana
has
gone
over
to
Carmody
with
her
father
,
''
said
Mrs.
Barry
,
going
*NL*
in
and
shutting
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
back
to
Green
Gables
calm
with
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
last
hope
is
gone
,
''
she
told
Marilla
.
``
I
went
up
and
saw
Mrs.
Barry
*NL*
myself
and
she
treated
me
very
insultingly
.
Marilla
,
I
do
NOT
think
she
*NL*
is
a
well-bred
woman
.
There
is
nothing
more
to
do
except
to
pray
and
I
*NL*
have
n't
much
hope
that
that
'll
do
much
good
because
,
Marilla
,
I
do
not
*NL*
believe
that
God
Himself
can
do
very
much
with
such
an
obstinate
person
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Barry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
you
should
n't
say
such
things
''
rebuked
Marilla
,
striving
to
*NL*
overcome
that
unholy
tendency
to
laughter
which
she
was
dismayed
to
find
*NL*
growing
upon
her
.
And
indeed
,
when
she
told
the
whole
story
to
Matthew
*NL*
that
night
,
she
did
laugh
heartily
over
Anne
's
tribulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
slipped
into
the
east
gable
before
going
to
bed
and
found
*NL*
that
Anne
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
an
unaccustomed
softness
crept
into
*NL*
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
soul
,
''
she
murmured
,
lifting
a
loose
curl
of
hair
from
the
*NL*
child
's
tear-stained
face
.
Then
she
bent
down
and
kissed
the
flushed
*NL*
cheek
on
the
pillow
.

CHAPTER
XVII
.
A
New
Interest
in
Life
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
afternoon
Anne
,
bending
over
her
patchwork
at
the
kitchen
*NL*
window
,
happened
to
glance
out
and
beheld
Diana
down
by
the
Dryad
's
*NL*
Bubble
beckoning
mysteriously
.
In
a
trice
Anne
was
out
of
the
house
*NL*
and
flying
down
to
the
hollow
,
astonishment
and
hope
struggling
in
*NL*
her
expressive
eyes
.
But
the
hope
faded
when
she
saw
Diana
's
dejected
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
has
n't
relented
?
''
she
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
shook
her
head
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
and
oh
,
Anne
,
she
says
I
'm
never
to
play
with
you
again
.
I
've
cried
*NL*
and
cried
and
I
told
her
it
was
n't
your
fault
,
but
it
was
n't
any
use
.
I
*NL*
had
ever
such
a
time
coaxing
her
to
let
me
come
down
and
say
good-bye
to
*NL*
you
.
She
said
I
was
only
to
stay
ten
minutes
and
she
's
timing
me
by
the
*NL*
clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
minutes
is
n't
very
long
to
say
an
eternal
farewell
in
,
''
said
Anne
*NL*
tearfully
.
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
will
you
promise
faithfully
never
to
forget
*NL*
me
,
the
friend
of
your
youth
,
no
matter
what
dearer
friends
may
caress
*NL*
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
will
,
''
sobbed
Diana
,
``
and
I
'll
never
have
another
bosom
*NL*
friend
--
I
do
n't
want
to
have
.
I
could
n't
love
anybody
as
I
love
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
''
cried
Anne
,
clasping
her
hands
,
``
do
you
LOVE
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
do
.
Did
n't
you
know
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Anne
drew
a
long
breath
.
``
I
thought
you
LIKED
me
of
course
but
I
*NL*
never
hoped
you
LOVED

Why

I
did
n't
think
anybody
could
*NL*
love
me

Nobody
ever
has
loved
me
since
I
can
remember

Oh

is

wonderful

a
ray
of
light
which
will
forever
shine
on
the
darkness

of
a
path
severed
from
thee

Oh

just
say
it
once
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
devotedly

said
Diana
stanchly
,
``

I
always
will

may
be
sure
of
that

I
will
always
love
thee
,
Diana
,
''
said
Anne
,
solemnly
extending
her
*NL*
hand
.
``
In
the
years
to
come
thy
memory
will
shine
like
a
star
over
my
*NL*
lonely
life
,
as
that
last
story
we
read
together
says
.
Diana
,
wilt
*NL*
thou
give
me
a
lock
of
thy
jet-black
tresses
in
parting
to
treasure
*NL*
forevermore
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
got
anything
to
cut
it
with
?
''
queried
Diana
,
wiping
away
the
*NL*
tears
which
Anne
's
affecting
accents
had
caused
to
flow
afresh
,
and
*NL*
returning
to
practicalities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
've
got
my
patchwork
scissors
in
my
apron
pocket
fortunately
,
''
*NL*
said
Anne
.
She
solemnly
clipped
one
of
Diana
's
curls
.
``
Fare
thee
well
,
*NL*
my
beloved
friend
.
Henceforth
we
must
be
as
strangers
though
living
side
*NL*
by
side
.
But
my
heart
will
ever
be
faithful
to
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
stood
and
watched
Diana
out
of
sight
,
mournfully
waving
her
hand
*NL*
to
the
latter
whenever
she
turned
to
look
back
.
Then
she
returned
to
*NL*
the
house
,
not
a
little
consoled
for
the
time
being
by
this
romantic
*NL*
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
over
,
''
she
informed
Marilla
.
``
I
shall
never
have
another
*NL*
friend
.
I
'm
really
worse
off
than
ever
before
,
for
I
have
n't
Katie
*NL*
Maurice
and
Violetta
now
.
And
even
if
I
had
it
would
n't
be
the
same
.
*NL*
Somehow
,
little
dream
girls
are
not
satisfying
after
a
real
friend
.
*NL*
Diana
and
I
had
such
an
affecting
farewell
down
by
the
spring
.
It
will
*NL*
be
sacred
in
my
memory
forever
.
I
used
the
most
pathetic
language
I
*NL*
could
think
of
and
said
`
thou
'
and
`
thee
.
'
`
Thou
'
and
`
thee
'
seem
so
*NL*
much
more
romantic
than
`
you
.
'
Diana
gave
me
a
lock
of
her
hair
and
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
sew
it
up
in
a
little
bag
and
wear
it
around
my
neck
all
my
*NL*
life
.
Please
see
that
it
is
buried
with
me
,
for
I
do
n't
believe
I
'll
*NL*
live
very
long
.
Perhaps
when
she
sees
me
lying
cold
and
dead
before
her
*NL*
Mrs.
Barry
may
feel
remorse
for
what
she
has
done
and
will
let
Diana
*NL*
come
to
my
funeral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
there
is
much
fear
of
your
dying
of
grief
as
long
as
you
*NL*
can
talk
,
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
unsympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
Monday
Anne
surprised
Marilla
by
coming
down
from
her
room
*NL*
with
her
basket
of
books
on
her
arm
and
hip
and
her
lips
primmed
up
into
*NL*
a
line
of
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
back
to
school
,
''
she
announced
.
``
That
is
all
there
is
left
*NL*
in
life
for
me
,
now
that
my
friend
has
been
ruthlessly
torn
from
me
.
In
*NL*
school
I
can
look
at
her
and
muse
over
days
departed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
muse
over
your
lessons
and
sums
,
''
said
Marilla
,
concealing
*NL*
her
delight
at
this
development
of
the
situation
.
``
If
you
're
going
back
*NL*
to
school
I
hope
we
'll
hear
no
more
of
breaking
slates
over
people
's
*NL*
heads
and
such
carryings
on
.
Behave
yourself
and
do
just
what
your
*NL*
teacher
tells
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
be
a
model
pupil
,
''
agreed
Anne
dolefully
.
``
There
wo
n't
be
*NL*
much
fun
in
it
,
I
expect
.
Mr.
Phillips
said
Minnie
Andrews
was
a
model
*NL*
pupil
and
there
is
n't
a
spark
of
imagination
or
life
in
her
.
She
is
*NL*
just
dull
and
poky
and
never
seems
to
have
a
good
time
.
But
I
feel
so
*NL*
depressed
that
perhaps
it
will
come
easy
to
me
now
.
I
'm
going
round
by
*NL*
the
road
.
I
could
n't
bear
to
go
by
the
Birch
Path
all
alone
.
I
should
*NL*
weep
bitter
tears
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
welcomed
back
to
school
with
open
arms
.
Her
imagination
had
*NL*
been
sorely
missed
in
games
,
her
voice
in
the
singing
and
her
dramatic
*NL*
ability
in
the
perusal
aloud
of
books
at
dinner
hour
.
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
smuggled
three
blue
plums
over
to
her
during
testament
reading
;
Ella
May
*NL*
MacPherson
gave
her
an
enormous
yellow
pansy
cut
from
the
covers
of
a
*NL*
floral
catalogue
--
a
species
of
desk
decoration
much
prized
in
Avonlea
*NL*
school
.
Sophia
Sloane
offered
to
teach
her
a
perfectly
elegant
new
*NL*
pattern
of
knit
lace
,
so
nice
for
trimming
aprons
.
Katie
Boulter
gave
*NL*
her
a
perfume
bottle
to
keep
slate
water
in
,
and
Julia
Bell
copied
*NL*
carefully
on
a
piece
of
pale
pink
paper
scalloped
on
the
edges
the
*NL*
following
effusion
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
twilight
drops
her
curtain
down
*NL*
And
pins
it
with
a
star
*NL*
Remember
that
you
have
a
friend
*NL*
Though
she
may
wander
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
nice
to
be
appreciated
,
''
sighed
Anne
rapturously
to
Marilla
*NL*
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
were
not
the
only
scholars
who
``
appreciated
''
her
.
When
Anne
*NL*
went
to
her
seat
after
dinner
hour
--
she
had
been
told
by
Mr.
Phillips
to
*NL*
sit
with
the
model
Minnie
Andrews
--
she
found
on
her
desk
a
big
luscious
*NL*
``
strawberry
apple
.
''
Anne
caught
it
up
all
ready
to
take
a
bite
when
she
*NL*
remembered
that
the
only
place
in
Avonlea
where
strawberry
apples
grew
*NL*
was
in
the
old
Blythe
orchard
on
the
other
side
of
the
Lake
of
Shining
*NL*
Waters
.
Anne
dropped
the
apple
as
if
it
were
a
red-hot
coal
and
*NL*
ostentatiously
wiped
her
fingers
on
her
handkerchief
.
The
apple
lay
*NL*
untouched
on
her
desk
until
the
next
morning
,
when
little
Timothy
*NL*
Andrews
,
who
swept
the
school
and
kindled
the
fire
,
annexed
it
as
one
*NL*
of
his
perquisites
.
Charlie
Sloane
's
slate
pencil
,
gorgeously
bedizened
*NL*
with
striped
red
and
yellow
paper
,
costing
two
cents
where
ordinary
*NL*
pencils
cost
only
one
,
which
he
sent
up
to
her
after
dinner
hour
,
met
*NL*
with
a
more
favorable
reception
.
Anne
was
graciously
pleased
to
accept
*NL*
it
and
rewarded
the
donor
with
a
smile
which
exalted
that
infatuated
*NL*
youth
straightway
into
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
and
caused
him
to
*NL*
make
such
fearful
errors
in
his
dictation
that
Mr.
Phillips
kept
him
in
*NL*
after
school
to
rewrite
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Caesar
's
pageant
shorn
of
Brutus
'
bust
*NL*
Did
but
of
Rome
's
best
son
remind
her
more
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
so
the
marked
absence
of
any
tribute
or
recognition
from
Diana
Barry
who
*NL*
was
sitting
with
Gertie
Pye
embittered
Anne
's
little
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diana
might
just
have
smiled
at
me
once
,
I
think
,
''
she
mourned
to
*NL*
Marilla
that
night
.
But
the
next
morning
a
note
most
fearfully
and
*NL*
wonderfully
twisted
and
folded
,
and
a
small
parcel
were
passed
across
to
*NL*
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear

I
'm
not

you
even
in

It
*NL*
is
n't
my
fault
and
do
n't
be
cross
at
me
,
because
I
love
you
as
much
*NL*
as
ever

I
miss
you
awfully
to
tell
all
my
secrets
to
and
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
Gertie
Pye
one
bit
.
I
made
you
one
of
the
new
bookmarkers
out
of
red
*NL*
tissue
paper
.
They
are
awfully
fashionable
now
and
only
three
girls
in

school
know
how
to
make
them
.
When
you
look
at
it
remember
*NL*
*NL*
Your
true
friend

*NL*
*NL*

read
the
note
,
kissed
the
bookmark
,
and
dispatched
a
prompt

back
to

side
of
the
school

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My

--

*NL*
Of

I
am
not
cross
at
you
because
you
have

obey

can
commune

*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
pessimistically
expected
more
trouble
since
Anne
had
again
begun
*NL*
to
go
to
school
.
But
none
developed
.
Perhaps
Anne
caught
something
of
*NL*
the
``
model
''
spirit
from
Minnie
Andrews
;
at
least
she
got
on
very
well
*NL*
with
Mr.
Phillips
thenceforth
.
She
flung
herself
into
her
studies
heart
*NL*
and
soul
,
determined
not
to
be
outdone
in
any
class
by
Gilbert
Blythe
.
*NL*
The
rivalry
between
them
was
soon
apparent
;
it
was
entirely
good
natured
*NL*
on
Gilbert
's
side
;
but
it
is
much
to
be
feared
that
the
same
thing
*NL*
can
not
be
said
of
Anne
,
who
had
certainly
an
unpraiseworthy
tenacity
for
*NL*
holding
grudges
.
She
was
as
intense
in
her
hatreds
as
in
her
loves
.
She
*NL*
would
not
stoop
to
admit
that
she
meant
to
rival
Gilbert
in
schoolwork
,
*NL*
because
that
would
have
been
to
acknowledge
his
existence
which
Anne
*NL*
persistently
ignored
;
but
the
rivalry
was
there
and
honors
fluctuated
*NL*
between
them
.
Now
Gilbert
was
head
of
the
spelling
class
;
now
Anne
,
with
*NL*
a
toss
of
her
long
red
braids
,
spelled
him
down
.
One
morning
Gilbert
had
*NL*
all
his
sums
done
correctly
and
had
his
name
written
on
the
blackboard
*NL*
on
the
roll
of
honor
;
the
next
morning
Anne
,
having
wrestled
wildly
with
*NL*
decimals
the
entire
evening
before
,
would
be
first
.
One
awful
day
they
*NL*
were
ties
and
their
names
were
written
up
together
.
It
was
almost
as
bad
*NL*
as
a
take-notice
and
Anne
's
mortification
was
as
evident
as
Gilbert
's
*NL*
satisfaction
.
When
the
written
examinations
at
the
end
of
each
month
*NL*
were
held
the
suspense
was
terrible
.
The
first
month
Gilbert
came
out
*NL*
three
marks
ahead
.
The
second
Anne
beat
him
by
five
.
But
her
triumph
was
*NL*
marred
by
the
fact
that
Gilbert
congratulated
her
heartily
before
the
*NL*
whole
school
.
It
would
have
been
ever
so
much
sweeter
to
her
if
he
had
*NL*
felt
the
sting
of
his
defeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Phillips
might
not
be
a
very
good
teacher
;
but
a
pupil
so
inflexibly
*NL*
determined
on
learning
as
Anne
was
could
hardly
escape
making
progress
*NL*
under
any
kind
of
teacher
.
By
the
end
of
the
term
Anne
and
Gilbert
were
*NL*
both
promoted
into
the
fifth
class
and
allowed
to
begin
studying
the
*NL*
elements
of
``
the
branches
''
--
by
which
Latin
,
geometry
,
French
,
and
*NL*
algebra
were
meant
.
In
geometry
Anne
met
her
Waterloo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
perfectly
awful
stuff
,
Marilla
,
''
she
groaned
.
``
I
'm
sure
I
'll
never
*NL*
be
able
to
make
head
or
tail
of
it
.
There
is
no
scope
for
imagination
in
*NL*
it
at
all
.
Mr.
Phillips
says
I
'm
the
worst
dunce
he
ever
saw
at
it
.
*NL*
And
Gil
--
I
mean
some
of
the
others
are
so
smart
at
it
.
It
is
extremely
*NL*
mortifying
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
Diana
gets
along
better
than
I
do
.
But
I
do
n't

being
beaten
*NL*
by
Diana
.
Even
although
we
meet
as
strangers
now
I
still
love
her
with
*NL*
an
INEXTINGUISHABLE
love
.
It
makes
me
very
sad
at
times
to
think
about
*NL*
her
.
But
really

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
Anne
to
the
Rescue
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
things
great
are
wound
up
with
all
things
little
.
At
first
glance
*NL*
it
might
not
seem
that
the
decision
of
a
certain
Canadian
Premier
to
*NL*
include
Prince
Edward
Island
in
a
political
tour
could
have
much
or
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
the
fortunes
of
little
Anne
Shirley
at
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
But
it
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
January
the
Premier
came
,
to
address
his
loyal
supporters
and
*NL*
such
of
his
nonsupporters
as
chose
to
be
present
at
the
monster
mass
*NL*
meeting
held
in
Charlottetown
.
Most
of
the
Avonlea
people
were
on
*NL*
Premier
's
side
of
politics
;
hence
on
the
night
of
the
meeting
nearly
*NL*
all
the
men
and
a
goodly
proportion
of
the
women
had
gone
to
town
thirty
*NL*
miles
away
.
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
had
gone
too
.
Mrs.
Rachel
Lynde
was
a
*NL*
red-hot
politician
and
could
n't
have
believed
that
the
political
rally
*NL*
could
be
carried
through
without
her
,
although
she
was
on
the
opposite
*NL*
side
of
politics
.
So
she
went
to
town
and
took
her
husband
--
Thomas
would
*NL*
be
useful
in
looking
after
the
horse
--
and
Marilla
Cuthbert
with
her
.
*NL*
Marilla
had
a
sneaking
interest
in
politics
herself
,
and
as
she
thought
*NL*
it
might
be
her
only
chance
to
see
a
real
live
Premier
,
she
promptly
*NL*
took
it
,
leaving
Anne
and
Matthew
to
keep
house
until
her
return
the
*NL*
following
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
while
Marilla
and
Mrs.
Rachel
were
enjoying
themselves
hugely
*NL*
at
the
mass
meeting
,
Anne
and
Matthew
had
the
cheerful
kitchen
at
Green
*NL*
Gables
all
to
themselves
.
A
bright
fire
was
glowing
in
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
Waterloo
stove
and
blue-white
frost
crystals
were
shining
on
the
*NL*
windowpanes
.
Matthew
nodded
over
a
FARMERS
'
ADVOCATE
on
the
sofa
and
*NL*
Anne
at
the
table
studied
her
lessons
with
grim
determination
,
despite
*NL*
sundry
wistful
glances
at
the
clock
shelf
,
where
lay
a
new
book
that
*NL*
Jane
Andrews
had
lent
her
that
day
.
Jane
had
assured
her
that
it
was
*NL*
warranted
to
produce
any
number
of
thrills
,
or
words
to
that
effect
,
and
*NL*
Anne
's
fingers
tingled
to
reach
out
for
it
.
But
that
would
mean
Gilbert
*NL*
Blythe
's
triumph
on
the
morrow
.
Anne
turned
her
back
on
the
clock
shelf
*NL*
and
tried
to
imagine
it
was
n't
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
,
did
you
ever
study
geometry
when
you
went
to
school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
no
,
I
did
n't
,
''
said
Matthew
,
coming
out
of
his
doze
with
a
*NL*
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
had
,
''
sighed
Anne
,
``
because
then
you
'd
be
able
to
sympathize
*NL*
with
me
.
You
ca
n't
sympathize
properly
if
you
've
never
studied
it
.
It
is
*NL*
casting
a
cloud
over
my
whole
life
.
I
'm
such
a
dunce
at
it
,
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
Matthew
soothingly
.
``
I
guess
you
're
all
right
*NL*
at
anything
.
Mr.
Phillips
told
me
last
week
in
Blair
's
store
at
Carmody
*NL*
that
you
was
the
smartest
scholar
in
school
and
was
making
rapid
*NL*
progress
.
`
Rapid
progress
'
was
his
very
words
.
There
's
them
as
runs
down
*NL*
Teddy
Phillips
and
says
he
ai
n't
much
of
a
teacher
,
but
I
guess
he
's
all
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
would
have
thought
anyone
who
praised
Anne
was
``
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
'd
get
on
better
with
geometry
if
only
he
would
n't
change
*NL*
the
letters
,
''
complained
Anne
.
``
I
learn
the
proposition
off
by
heart
and
*NL*
then
he
draws
it
on
the
blackboard
and
puts
different
letters
from
what
*NL*
are
in
the
book
and
I
get
all
mixed
up
.
I
do
n't
think
a
teacher
should
*NL*
take
such
a
mean
advantage
,
do
you
?
We
're
studying
agriculture
now
and
*NL*
I
've
found
out
at
last
what
makes
the
roads
red
.
It
's
a
great
comfort
.
*NL*
I
wonder
how
Marilla
and
Mrs.
Lynde
are
enjoying
themselves
.
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
says
Canada
is
going
to
the
dogs
the
way
things
are
being
run
at
Ottawa
*NL*
and
that
it
's
an
awful
warning
to
the
electors
.
She
says
if
women
were
*NL*
allowed
to
vote
we
would
soon
see
a
blessed
change
.
What
way
do
you
*NL*
vote
,
Matthew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Conservative
,
''
said
Matthew
promptly
.
To
vote
Conservative
was
part
of
*NL*
Matthew
's
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'm
Conservative
too
,
''
said
Anne
decidedly
.
``
I
'm
glad
because
*NL*
Gil
--
because
some
of
the
boys
in
school
are
Grits
.
I
guess
Mr.
Phillips
*NL*
is
a
Grit
too
because
Prissy
Andrews
's
father
is
one
,
and
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
says
that
when
a
man
is
courting
he
always
has
to
agree
with
the
girl
's
*NL*
mother
in
religion
and
her
father
in
politics
.
Is
that
true
,
Matthew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
go
courting
,
Matthew
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
no
,
I
dunno
's
I
ever
did
,
''
said
Matthew
,
who
had
certainly
*NL*
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
in
his
whole
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
reflected
with
her
chin
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
rather
interesting
,
do
n't
you
think
,
Matthew
?
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
says
when
she
grows
up
she
's
going
to
have
ever
so
many
beaus
on
the
*NL*
string
and
have
them
all
crazy
about
her
;
but
I
think
that
would
be
too
*NL*
exciting
.
I
'd
rather
have
just
one
in
his
right
mind
.
But
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
knows
a
great
deal
about
such
matters
because
she
has
so
many
big
*NL*
sisters
,
and
Mrs.
Lynde
says
the
Gillis
girls
have
gone
off
like
hot
*NL*
cakes
.
Mr.
Phillips
goes
up
to
see
Prissy
Andrews
nearly
every
evening
.
*NL*
He
says
it
is
to
help
her
with
her
lessons
but
Miranda
Sloane
is
*NL*
studying
for
Queen
's
too
,
and
I
should
think
she
needed
help
a
lot
more
*NL*
than
Prissy
because
she
's
ever
so
much
stupider
,
but
he
never
goes
to
*NL*
help
her
in
the
evenings
at
all
.
There
are
a
great
many
things
in
this
*NL*
world
that
I
ca
n't
understand
very
well
,
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
as
I
comprehend
them
all
myself
,
''
acknowledged
*NL*
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
I
must
finish
up
my
lessons
.
I
wo
n't
allow
myself
to
*NL*
open
that
new
book
Jane
lent
me
until
I
'm
through
.
But
it
's
a
terrible
*NL*
temptation
,
Matthew
.
Even
when
I
turn
my
back
on
it
I
can
see
it
there
*NL*
just
as
plain
.
Jane
said
she
cried
herself
sick
over
it
.
I
love
a
book
*NL*
that
makes
me
cry
.
But
I
think
I
'll
carry
that
book
into
the
sitting
*NL*
room
and
lock
it
in
the
jam
closet
and
give
you
the
key
.
And
you
must
*NL*
NOT
give
it
to
me
,
Matthew
,
until
my
lessons
are
done
,
not
even
if
*NL*
I
implore
you
on
my
bended
knees
.
It
's
all
very
well
to
say
resist
*NL*
temptation
,
but
it
's
ever
so
much
easier
to
resist
it
if
you
ca
n't
get
*NL*
the
key
.
And
then
shall
I
run
down
the
cellar
and
get
some
russets
,
*NL*
Matthew
?
Would
n't
you
like
some
russets
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
but
what
I
would
,
''
said
Matthew
,
who
never
ate
*NL*
russets
but
knew
Anne
's
weakness
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Anne
emerged
triumphantly
from
the
cellar
with
her
plateful
of
*NL*
russets
came
the
sound
of
flying
footsteps
on
the
icy
board
walk
outside
*NL*
and
the
next
moment
the
kitchen
door
was
flung
open
and
in
rushed
Diana
*NL*
Barry
,
white
faced
and
breathless
,
with
a
shawl
wrapped
hastily
around
*NL*
her
head
.
Anne
promptly
let
go
of
her
candle
and
plate
in
her
surprise
,
*NL*
and
plate
,
candle
,
and
apples
crashed
together
down
the
cellar
ladder
*NL*
and
were
found
at
the
bottom
embedded
in
melted
grease
,
the
next
day
,
*NL*
by
Marilla
,
who
gathered
them
up
and
thanked
mercy
the
house
had
n't
been
*NL*
set
on
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
is
the
matter

Diana

cried
Anne

``
Has
your

relented
*NL*
at
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Anne

implored
Diana
nervously

*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
,
without
a
word
,
reached
out
for
cap
and
coat
,
slipped
past
*NL*
Diana
and
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

who
was
hurrying
on
hood

sobbed
Diana
.
``
I

know

*NL*
*NL*

said
Anne
cheerily

I
know
exactly
what
to
do

You
forget
that

had
twins
three
times

When
you
look
*NL*
after
three
pairs
of
twins
you
naturally
get
a
lot
of
experience
.
They
*NL*
all
had
croup
regularly

Just
wait
till
I
get
the
ipecac
bottle
--
you
*NL*
may

have
any
at
your

Come
on
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
girls
hastened
out
hand
in
hand
and
hurried
through
*NL*
Lover
's
Lane
and
across
the
crusted
field
beyond
,
for
the
snow
was
too
*NL*
deep
to
go
by
the
shorter
wood
way
.
Anne
,
although
sincerely
sorry
*NL*
for
Minnie
May
,
was
far
from
being
insensible
to
the
romance
of
the
*NL*
situation
and
to
the
sweetness
of
once
more
sharing
that
romance
with
a
*NL*
kindred
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
clear
and
frosty
,
all
ebony
of
shadow
and
silver
of
snowy
*NL*
slope
;
big
stars
were
shining
over
the
silent
fields
;
here
and
there
the
*NL*
dark
pointed
firs
stood
up
with
snow
powdering
their
branches
and
the
*NL*
wind
whistling
through
them
.
Anne
thought
it
was
truly
delightful
to
go
*NL*
skimming
through
all
this
mystery
and
loveliness
with
your
bosom
friend
*NL*
who
had
been
so
long
estranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
May
,
aged
three
,
was
really
very
sick
.
She
lay
on
the
kitchen
*NL*
sofa
feverish
and
restless
,
while
her
hoarse
breathing
could
be
heard
*NL*
all
over
the
house
.
Young
Mary
Joe
,
a
buxom
,
broad-faced
French
girl
*NL*
from
the
creek
,
whom
Mrs.
Barry
had
engaged
to
stay
with
the
children
*NL*
during
her
absence
,
was
helpless
and
bewildered
,
quite
incapable
of
*NL*
thinking
what
to
do
,
or
doing
it
if
she
thought
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
to
work
with
skill
and
promptness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minnie
May
has
croup
all
right
;
she
's
pretty
bad
,
but
I
've
seen
them
*NL*
worse

First
we
must
have
lots
of
hot
water
.
I
declare
,
Diana
,
there
*NL*
is
n't
more
than
a
cupful
in
the
kettle
!
There
,
I
've
filled
it
up
,
and
,
*NL*
Mary
Joe
,
you
may
put
some
wood
in
the
stove
.
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
your

feelings
but
it
seems
to
me
you
might
have
thought
of
this
before
if
*NL*
you
'd
any
imagination
.
Now
,
I
'll
undress
Minnie
May
and
put
her
to
bed
*NL*
and
you
try
to
find
some
soft
flannel
cloths
,
Diana
.
I
'm
going
to
give
*NL*
her
a
dose
of
ipecac
first
of
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
May
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
ipecac
but
Anne
had
not
brought
up
*NL*
three
pairs
of
twins
for
nothing
.
Down
that
ipecac
went
,
not
only
once
,
*NL*
but
many
times
during
the
long
,
anxious
night
when
the
two
little
girls
*NL*
worked
patiently
over
the
suffering
Minnie
May
,
and
Young
Mary
Joe
,
*NL*
honestly
anxious
to
do
all
she
could
,
kept
up
a
roaring
fire
and
heated
*NL*
more
water
than
would
have
been
needed
for
a
hospital
of
croupy
babies
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
three
o'clock
when
Matthew
came
with
a
doctor
,
for
he
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
go
all
the
way
to
Spencervale
for
one
.
But
the
pressing
need
*NL*
for
assistance
was
past
.
Minnie
May
was
much
better
and
was
sleeping
*NL*
soundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
awfully
near
giving
up
in
despair
,
''
explained
Anne
.
``
She
got
*NL*
worse
and
worse
until
she
was
sicker
than
ever
the
Hammond
twins
were
,
*NL*
even
the
last
pair
.
I
actually
thought
she
was
going
to
choke
to
death
.
*NL*
I
gave
her
every
drop
of
ipecac
in
that
bottle
and
when
the
last
dose
*NL*
went
down
I
said
to
myself
--
not
to
Diana
or
Young
Mary
Joe
,
because
I
*NL*
did
n't
want
to
worry
them
any
more
than
they
were
worried
,
but
I
had
*NL*
to
say
it
to
myself
just
to
relieve
my
feelings
--
`
This
is
the
last
*NL*
lingering
hope
and
I
fear
,
tis
a
vain
one
.
'
But
in
about
three
minutes
*NL*
she
coughed
up
the
phlegm
and
began
to
get
better
right
away
.
You
must
*NL*
just
imagine
my
relief
,
doctor
,
because
I
ca
n't
express
it
in
words
.
You
*NL*
know
there
are
some
things
that
can
not
be
expressed
in
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
''
nodded
the
doctor
.
He
looked
at
Anne
as
if
he
were
*NL*
thinking
some
things
about
her
that
could
n't
be
expressed
in
words
.
*NL*
Later
on
,
however
,
he
expressed
them
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Barry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
redheaded
girl
they
have
over
at
Cuthbert

is
as
smart

they

I
tell
you
she
saved
that
baby
's
life
,
for
it
would
have
*NL*
been
too
late
by
the
time
I
got
there
.
She
seems
to
have
a
skill
and
*NL*
presence
of
mind
perfectly
wonderful
in
a
child
of
her
age
.
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
like
the
eyes
of
her
when
she
was
explaining
the
case
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
gone
home
in
the
wonderful
,
white-frosted
winter
morning
,
heavy
*NL*
eyed
from
loss
of
sleep
,
but
still
talking
unweariedly
to
Matthew
as
*NL*
they
crossed
the
long
white
field
and
walked
under
the
glittering
fairy
*NL*
arch
of
the
Lover
's
Lane
maples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matthew

is
n't
it
a
wonderful
morning

The
world
looks
like

something
God
had
just
imagined
for
His
own
pleasure

does
n't
it
?
Those
*NL*
trees
look
as
if
I
could
blow
them
away
with
a
breath
--
pouf
!
I
'm
so
glad
*NL*
I
live
in
a
world
where
there
are
white
frosts
,
are
n't
you
?
And
I
'm
so
*NL*
glad
Mrs.
Hammond
had
three
pairs
of
twins
after
all
.
If
she
had
n't
I
*NL*
might
n't
have
known
what
to
do
for
Minnie
May
.
I
'm
real
sorry
I
was
*NL*
ever
cross
with
Mrs.
Hammond
for
having
twins
.
But
,
oh
,
Matthew
,
I
'm
so
*NL*
sleepy
.
I
ca
n't
go
to
school
.
I
just
know
I
could
n't
keep
my
eyes
open
*NL*
and
I
'd
be
so
stupid
.
But
I
hate
to
stay
home
,
for
Gil
--
some
of
*NL*
the
others
will
get
head
of
the
class
,
and
it
's
so
hard
to
get
up
*NL*
again
--
although
of
course
the
harder
it
is
the
more
satisfaction
you
*NL*
have
when
you
do
get
up
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
guess
you
'll
manage
all
right
,
''
said
Matthew
,
looking
at
*NL*
Anne
's
white
little
face
and
the
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
.
``
You
just
*NL*
go
right
to
bed
and
have
a
good
sleep
.
I
'll
do
all
the
chores
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
accordingly
went
to
bed
and
slept
so
long
and
soundly
that
it
*NL*
was
well
on
in
the
white
and
rosy
winter
afternoon
when
she
awoke
and
*NL*
descended
to
the
kitchen
where
Marilla
,
who
had
arrived
home
in
the
*NL*
meantime
,
was
sitting
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
you
see
the
Premier
?
''
exclaimed
Anne
at
once
.
``
What
did
he
look
*NL*
like
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
never
got
to
be
Premier
on
account
of
his
looks
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
Such
a
nose
as
that
man
had
!
But
he
can
speak
.
I
was
proud
of
*NL*
being
a
Conservative
.
Rachel
Lynde
,
of
course
,
being
a
Liberal
,
had
no
*NL*
use
for
him
.
Your
dinner
is
in
the
oven
,
Anne
,
and
you
can
get
yourself
*NL*
some
blue
plum
preserve
out
of
the
pantry
.
I
guess
you
're
hungry
.
*NL*
Matthew
has
been
telling
me
about
last
night
.
I
must
say
it
was
*NL*
fortunate
you
knew
what
to
do
.
I
would
n't
have
had
any
idea
myself
,
for
*NL*
I
never
saw
a
case
of
croup
.
There
now
,
never
mind
talking
till
you
've
*NL*
had
your
dinner
.
I
can
tell
by
the
look
of
you
that
you
're
just
full
up
*NL*
with
speeches
,
but
they
'll
keep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
something
to
tell
Anne
,
but
she
did
not
tell
it
just
then
*NL*
for
she
knew
if
she
did
Anne
's
consequent
excitement
would
lift
her
*NL*
clear
out
of
the
region
of
such
material
matters
as
appetite
or
dinner
.
*NL*
Not
until
Anne
had
finished
her
saucer
of
blue
plums
did
Marilla
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Barry
was
here
this
afternoon
,
Anne
.
She
wanted
to
see
you
,
but
I
*NL*
would
n't
wake
you
up
.
She
says
you
saved
Minnie
May
's
life
,
and
she
is
*NL*
very
sorry
she
acted
as
she
did
in
that
affair
of
the
currant
wine
.
She
*NL*
says
she
knows
now
you
did
n't
mean
to
set
Diana
drunk
,
and
she
hopes
*NL*
you
'll
forgive
her
and
be
good
friends
with
Diana
again
.
You
're
to
go
*NL*
over
this
evening
if
you
like
for
Diana
ca
n't
stir
outside
the
door
*NL*
on
account
of
a
bad
cold
she
caught
last
night
.
Now
,
Anne
Shirley
,
for
*NL*
pity
's
sake
do
n't
fly
up
into
the
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
warning
seemed
not
unnecessary
,
so
uplifted
and
aerial
was
Anne
's
*NL*
expression
and
attitude
as
she
sprang
to
her
feet
,
her
face
irradiated
*NL*
with
the
flame
of
her
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
can
I
go
right
now
--
without
washing
my
dishes
?
I
'll
wash
*NL*
them
when
I
come
back
,
but
I
can
not
tie
myself
down
to
anything
so
*NL*
unromantic
as
dishwashing
at
this
thrilling
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
run
along
,
''
said
Marilla
indulgently
.
``
Anne
Shirley
--
are
you
*NL*
crazy
?
Come
back
this
instant
and
put
something
on
you
.
I
might
as
well
*NL*
call
to
the
wind
.
She
's
gone
without
a
cap
or
wrap
.
Look
at
her
tearing
*NL*
through
the
orchard
with
her
hair
streaming
.
It
'll
be
a
mercy
if
she
*NL*
does
n't
catch
her
death
of
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
came
dancing
home
in
the
purple
winter
twilight
across
the
snowy
*NL*
places
.
Afar
in
the
southwest
was
the
great
shimmering
,
pearl-like
*NL*
sparkle
of
an
evening
star
in
a
sky
that
was
pale
golden
and
ethereal
*NL*
rose
over
gleaming
white
spaces
and
dark
glens
of
spruce
.
The
tinkles
*NL*
of
sleigh
bells
among
the
snowy
hills
came
like
elfin
chimes
through
*NL*
the
frosty
air
,
but
their
music
was
not
sweeter
than
the
song
in
Anne
's
*NL*
heart
and
on
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
before
you
a
perfectly
happy
person
,
Marilla
,
''
she
announced
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
perfectly
happy
--
yes
,
in
spite
of
my
red
hair
.
Just
at
present
I
*NL*
have
a
soul
above
red
hair
.
Mrs.
Barry
kissed
me
and
cried
and
said
she
*NL*
was
so
sorry
and
she
could
never
repay
me
.
I
felt
fearfully
embarrassed
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
but
I
just
said
as
politely
as
I
could
,
'
I
have
no
hard
*NL*
feelings
for
you
,
Mrs.
Barry
.
I
assure
you
once
for
all
that
I
did
not
*NL*
mean
to
intoxicate
Diana
and
henceforth
I
shall
cover
the
past
with
the
*NL*
mantle
of
oblivion
.
'
That
was
a
pretty
dignified
way
of
speaking
was
n't
*NL*
it
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
that
I
was
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
Mrs.
Barry
's
head
.
And
Diana
*NL*
and
I
had
a
lovely
afternoon
.
Diana
showed
me
a
new
fancy
crochet
stitch
*NL*
her
aunt
over
at
Carmody
taught
her
.
Not
a
soul
in
Avonlea
knows
it
but
*NL*
us
,
and
we
pledged
a
solemn
vow
never
to
reveal
it
to
anyone
else
.
Diana
*NL*
gave
me
a
beautiful
card
with
a
wreath
of
roses
on
it
and
a
verse
of
*NL*
poetry
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
love
me
as
I
love
you
*NL*
Nothing
but
death
can
part
us
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
true
,
Marilla
.
We
're
going
to
ask
Mr.
Phillips
to
let
us
sit
*NL*
together
in
school
again
,
and
Gertie
Pye
can
go
with
Minnie
Andrews
.
We
*NL*
had
an
elegant
tea
.
Mrs.
Barry
had
the
very
best
china
set
out
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
just
as
if
I
was
real
company
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
what
a
thrill
it
gave
*NL*
me
.
Nobody
ever
used
their
very
best
china
on
my
account
before
.
And
we
*NL*
had
fruit
cake
and
pound
cake
and
doughnuts
and
two
kinds
of
preserves
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
And
Mrs.
Barry
asked
me
if
I
took
tea
and
said
`
Pa
,
why
do
n't
*NL*
you
pass
the
biscuits
to
Anne
?
'
It
must
be
lovely
to
be
grown
up
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
when
just
being
treated
as
if
you
were
is
so
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
said
Marilla
,
with
a
brief
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyway
,
when
I
am
grown
up
,
''
said
Anne
decidedly
,
``
I
'm
always
*NL*
going
to
talk
to
little
girls
as
if
they
were
too
,
and
I
'll
never
laugh
*NL*
when
they
use
big
words
.
I
know
from
sorrowful
experience
how
that
hurts
*NL*
one
's
feelings
.
After
tea
Diana
and
I
made
taffy
.
The
taffy
was
n't
very
*NL*
good
,
I
suppose
because
neither
Diana
nor
I
had
ever
made
any
before
.
*NL*
Diana
left
me
to
stir
it
while
she
buttered
the
plates
and
I
forgot
and
*NL*
let
it
burn
;
and
then
when
we
set
it
out
on
the
platform
to
cool
the
cat
*NL*
walked
over
one
plate
and
that
had
to
be
thrown
away
.
But
the
making
of
*NL*
it
was
splendid
fun
.
Then
when
I
came
home
Mrs.
Barry
asked
me
to
come
*NL*
over
as
often
as
I
could
and
Diana
stood
at
the
window
and
threw
kisses
*NL*
to
me
all
the
way
down
to
Lover
's
Lane
.
I
assure
you
,
Marilla
,
that
I
*NL*
feel
like
praying
tonight
and
I
'm
going
to
think
out
a
special
brand-new
*NL*
prayer
in
honor
of
the
occasion

CHAPTER
XIX

A
Concert
a
Catastrophe
and
a
Confession
*NL*
*NL*
``
MARILLA
,
can
I
go
over
to
see
Diana
just
for
a
minute
?
''
asked
Anne
,
*NL*
running
breathlessly
down
from
the
east
gable
one
February
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
you
want
to
be
traipsing
about
after
dark
for
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
shortly
.
``
You
and
Diana
walked
home
from
school
together
and
*NL*
then
stood
down
there
in
the
snow
for
half
an
hour
more
,
your
tongues
*NL*
going
the
whole
blessed
time
,
clickety-clack
.
So
I
do
n't
think
you
're
*NL*
very
badly
off
to
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
wants
to
see
me
,
''
pleaded
Anne
.
``
She
has
something
very
*NL*
important
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
she
has
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
just
signaled
to
me
from
her
window
.
We
have
arranged
a
*NL*
way
to
signal
with
our
candles
and
cardboard
.
We
set
the
candle
on
the
*NL*
window
sill
and
make
flashes
by
passing
the
cardboard
back
and
forth
.
So
*NL*
many
flashes
mean
a
certain
thing
.
It
was
my
idea
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
warrant
you
it
was
,
''
said
Marilla
emphatically
.
``
And
the
next
*NL*
thing
you
'll
be
setting
fire
to
the
curtains
with
your
signaling
*NL*
nonsense

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
're
very
careful

Marilla

And
it
's
so
interesting

Two
flashes
*NL*
mean
,
`
Are
you
there
?
'
Three
mean
`
yes
'
and
four
`
no

Five
mean
,

Come
*NL*
over
as
soon
as
possible

I
have
something
important
to
reveal

*NL*
Diana
has
just
signaled
five
flashes

I
'm
really
suffering
to
know

what
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
need

suffer
any
longer

Marilla
sarcastically
.
``
You
*NL*
can
go
,
but
you
're
to
be
back
here
in
just
ten
minutes
,
remember
that

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
remember
it
and
was
back
in
the
stipulated
time
,
although
*NL*
probably
no
mortal
will
ever
know
just
what
it
cost
her
to
confine
the
*NL*
discussion
of
Diana
's
important
communication
within
the
limits
of
ten
*NL*
minutes

But
at

she
had
made
good
use

them

*NL*
``
Oh

Marilla

what
do
you
think

You
know
tomorrow

Diana
's
birthday

her
mother
told

Newbridge
in

big
pung
sleigh

go

down

it

only
one

lots

are
going

sing
four
lovely
pathetic

,
and
*NL*
do
n't
let
me
hear
another
word
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anne
,
with
tears
rolling
over
her
cheeks
,
had
gone
sorrowfully
*NL*
upstairs
,
Matthew
,
who
had
been
apparently
sound
asleep
on
the
lounge
*NL*
during
the
whole
dialogue
,
opened
his
eyes
and
said
decidedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
Marilla
,
I
think
you
ought
to
let
Anne
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
then
,
''
retorted
Marilla
.
``
Who
's
bringing
this
child
up
,
*NL*
Matthew
,
you
or
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
you
,
''
admitted
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
interfere
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
ai
n't
interfering
.
It
ai
n't
interfering
to
have
your
own
*NL*
opinion
.
And
my
opinion
is
that
you
ought
to
let
Anne
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
think
I
ought
to
let
Anne
go
to
the
moon
if
she
took
the
notion
,
*NL*
I
've
no
doubt
''
was
Marilla
's
amiable
rejoinder
.
``
I
might
have
let
her
*NL*
spend
the
night
with
Diana
,
if
that
was
all
.
But
I
do
n't
approve
of
this
*NL*
concert
plan
.
She
'd
go
there
and
catch
cold
like
as
not
,
and
have
her
*NL*
head
filled
up
with
nonsense
and
excitement
.
It
would
unsettle
her
for
*NL*
a
week
.
I
understand
that
child
's
disposition
and
what
's
good
for
it
*NL*
better
than
you
,
Matthew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
ought
to
let
Anne
go
,
''
repeated
Matthew
firmly
.
Argument
*NL*
was
not
his
strong
point
,
but
holding
fast
to
his
opinion
certainly
was
.
*NL*
Marilla
gave
a
gasp
of
helplessness
and
took
refuge
in
silence
.
The
*NL*
next
morning
,
when
Anne
was
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
in
the
pantry
,
*NL*
Matthew
paused
on
his
way
out
to
the
barn
to
say
to
Marilla
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
ought
to
let
Anne
go
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Marilla
looked
things
not
lawful
to
be
uttered
.
Then
she
*NL*
yielded
to
the
inevitable
and
said
tartly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
she
can
go
,
since
nothing
else
'll
please
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
flew
out
of
the
pantry
,
dripping
dishcloth
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
Marilla
,
say
those
blessed
words
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
once
is
enough
to
say
them
.
This
is
Matthew
's
doings
and
I
*NL*
wash
my
hands
of
it
.
If
you
catch
pneumonia
sleeping
in
a
strange
bed
or
*NL*
coming
out
of
that
hot
hall
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
do
n't
blame
me
,
*NL*
blame
Matthew
.
Anne
Shirley
,
you
're
dripping
greasy
water
all
over
the
*NL*
floor
.
I
never
saw
such
a
careless
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
I
'm
a
great
trial
to
you
,
Marilla
,
''
said
Anne
repentantly
.
*NL*
``
I
make
so
many
mistakes
.
But
then
just
think
of
all
the
mistakes
I
*NL*
do
n't
make
,
although
I
might
.
I
'll
get
some
sand
and
scrub
up
the
spots
*NL*
before
I
go
to
school
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
my
heart
was
just
set
on
going
to
*NL*
that
concert
.
I
never
was
to
a
concert
in
my
life
,
and
when
the
other
*NL*
girls
talk
about
them
in
school
I
feel
so
out
of
it
.
You
did
n't
know
*NL*
just
how
I
felt
about
it
,
but
you
see
Matthew
did
.
Matthew
understands
*NL*
me
,
and
it
's
so
nice
to
be
understood
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
too
excited
to
do
herself
justice
as
to
lessons
that
morning
in
*NL*
school
.
Gilbert
Blythe
spelled
her
down
in
class
and
left
her
clear
out
*NL*
of
sight
in
mental
arithmetic
.
Anne
's
consequent
humiliation
was
*NL*
less
than
it
might
have
been
,
however
,
in
view
of
the
concert
and
the
*NL*
spare-room
bed
.
She
and
Diana
talked
so
constantly
about
it
all
day
that
*NL*
with
a
stricter
teacher
than
Mr.
Phillips
dire
disgrace
must
inevitably
*NL*
have
been
their
portion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
felt
that
she
could
not
have
borne
it
if
she
had
not
been
going
*NL*
to
the
concert
,
for
nothing
else
was
discussed
that
day
in
school
.
The
*NL*
Avonlea
Debating
Club
,
which
met
fortnightly
all
winter
,
had
had
several
*NL*
smaller
free
entertainments
;
but
this
was
to
be
a
big
affair
,
admission
*NL*
ten
cents
,
in
aid
of
the
library
.
The
Avonlea
young
people
had
been
*NL*
practicing
for
weeks
,
and
all
the
scholars
were
especially
interested
in
*NL*
it
by
reason
of
older
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
going
to
take
part
.
*NL*
Everybody
in
school
over
nine
years
of
age
expected
to
go
,
except
Carrie
*NL*
Sloane
,
whose
father
shared
Marilla
's
opinions
about
small
girls
going
*NL*
out
to
night
concerts
.
Carrie
Sloane
cried
into
her
grammar
all
the
*NL*
afternoon
and
felt
that
life
was
not
worth
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Anne
the
real
excitement
began
with
the
dismissal
of
school
and
*NL*
increased
therefrom
in
crescendo
until
it
reached
to
a
crash
of
positive
*NL*
ecstasy
in
the
concert
itself
.
They
had
a
``
perfectly
elegant
tea
;
''
and
*NL*
then
came
the
delicious
occupation
of
dressing
in
Diana
's
little
room
*NL*
upstairs
.
Diana
did
Anne
's
front
hair
in
the
new
pompadour
style
and
*NL*
Anne
tied
Diana
's
bows
with
the
especial
knack
she
possessed
;
and
they
*NL*
experimented
with
at
least
half
a
dozen
different
ways
of
arranging
*NL*
their
back
hair
.
At
last
they
were
ready
,
cheeks
scarlet
and
eyes
*NL*
glowing
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
,
Anne
could
not
help
a
little
pang
when
she
contrasted
her
plain
*NL*
black
tam
and
shapeless
,
tight-sleeved
,
homemade
gray-cloth
coat
with
*NL*
Diana
's
jaunty
fur
cap
and
smart
little
jacket
.
But
she
remembered
in
*NL*
time
that
she
had
an
imagination
and
could
use
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Diana
's
cousins
,
the
Murrays
from
Newbridge
,
came
;
they
all
crowded
*NL*
into
the
big
pung
sleigh
,
among
straw
and
furry
robes
.
Anne
reveled
in
*NL*
the
drive
to
the
hall
,
slipping
along
over
the
satin-smooth
roads
with
*NL*
the
snow
crisping
under
the
runners
.
There
was
a
magnificent
sunset
,
and
*NL*
the
snowy
hills
and
deep-blue
water
of
the
St.
Lawrence
Gulf
seemed
to
*NL*
rim
in
the
splendor
like
a
huge
bowl
of
pearl
and
sapphire
brimmed
with
*NL*
wine
and
fire
.
Tinkles
of
sleigh
bells
and
distant
laughter
,
that
seemed
*NL*
like
the
mirth
of
wood
elves
,
came
from
every
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
''
breathed
Anne
,
squeezing
Diana
's
mittened
hand
under
the
*NL*
fur
robe
,
``
is
n't
it
all
like
a
beautiful
dream
?
Do
I
really
look
the
*NL*
same
as
usual
?
I
feel
so
different
that
it
seems
to
me
it
must
show
in
*NL*
my
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
awfully
nice
,
''
said
Diana
,
who
having
just
received
a
*NL*
compliment
from
one
of
her
cousins
,
felt
that
she
ought
to
pass
it
on
.
*NL*
``
You
've
got
the
loveliest
color
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
program
that
night
was
a
series
of
``
thrills
''
for
at
least
one
*NL*
listener
in
the
audience
,
and
,
as
Anne
assured
Diana
,
every
succeeding
*NL*
thrill
was
thrillier
than
the
last
.
When
Prissy
Andrews
,
attired
in
*NL*
a
new
pink-silk
waist
with
a
string
of
pearls
about
her
smooth
white
*NL*
throat
and
real
carnations
in
her
hair
--
rumor
whispered
that
the
master
*NL*
had
sent
all
the
way
to
town
for
them
for
her
--
``
climbed
the
slimy
*NL*
ladder
,
dark
without
one
ray
of
light
,
''
Anne
shivered
in
luxurious
*NL*
sympathy
;
when
the
choir
sang
``
Far
Above
the
Gentle
Daisies
''
Anne
gazed
*NL*
at
the
ceiling
as
if
it
were
frescoed
with
angels
;
when
Sam
Sloane
*NL*
proceeded
to
explain
and
illustrate
``
How
Sockery
Set
a
Hen
''
Anne
laughed
*NL*
until
people
sitting
near
her
laughed
too
,
more
out
of
sympathy
with
her
*NL*
than
with
amusement
at
a
selection
that
was
rather
threadbare
even
in
*NL*
Avonlea
;
and
when
Mr.
Phillips
gave
Mark
Antony
's
oration
over
the
*NL*
dead
body
of
Caesar
in
the
most
heart-stirring
tones
--
looking
at
Prissy
*NL*
Andrews
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
--
Anne
felt
that
she
could
rise
and
*NL*
mutiny
on
the
spot
if
but
one
Roman
citizen
led
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
one
number
on
the
program
failed
to
interest
her
.
When
Gilbert
*NL*
Blythe
recited
``
Bingen
on
the
Rhine
''
Anne
picked
up
Rhoda
Murray
's
*NL*
library
book
and
read
it
until
he
had
finished
,
when
she
sat
rigidly
*NL*
stiff
and
motionless
while
Diana
clapped
her
hands
until
they
tingled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eleven
when
they
got
home
,
sated
with
dissipation
,
but
with
the
*NL*
exceeding
sweet
pleasure
of
talking
it
all
over
still
to
come
.
Everybody
*NL*
seemed
asleep
and
the
house
was
dark
and
silent
.
Anne
and
Diana
tiptoed
*NL*
into
the
parlor
,
a
long
narrow
room
out
of
which
the
spare
room
opened
.
*NL*
It
was
pleasantly
warm
and
dimly
lighted
by
the
embers
of
a
fire
in
the
*NL*
grate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
undress
here
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
It
's
so
nice
and
warm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
it
been
a
delightful
time
?
''
sighed
Anne
rapturously
.
``
It
must
*NL*
be
splendid
to
get
up
and
recite
there
.
Do
you
suppose
we
will
ever
be
*NL*
asked
to
do
it
,
Diana
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
,
someday
.
They
're
always
wanting
the
big
scholars
to
*NL*
recite
.
Gilbert
Blythe
does
often
and
he
's
only
two
years
older
than
us
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Anne
,
how
could
you
pretend
not
to
listen
to
him
?
When
he
came
to
*NL*
the
line
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
THERE
'S
ANOTHER
,
not
A
SISTER
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
he
looked
right
down
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Diana
,
''
said
Anne
with
dignity
,
``
you
are
my
bosom
friend
,
but
I
can
not
*NL*
allow
even
you
to
speak
to
me
of
that
person
.
Are
you
ready
for
bed
?
*NL*
Let
's
run
a
race
and
see
who
'll
get
to
the
bed
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
suggestion
appealed
to
Diana
.
The
two
little
white-clad
figures
flew
*NL*
down
the
long
room
,
through
the
spare-room
door
,
and
bounded
on
the
bed
*NL*
at
the
same
moment
.
And
then
--
something
--
moved
beneath
them
,
there
was
a
*NL*
gasp
and
a
cry
--
and
somebody
said
in
muffled
accents
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merciful
goodness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
Diana
were
never
able
to
tell
just
how
they
got
off
that
bed
*NL*
and
out
of
the
room
.
They
only
knew
that
after
one
frantic
rush
they
*NL*
found
themselves
tiptoeing
shiveringly
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
who
was
it
--
WHAT
was
it
?
''
whispered
Anne
,
her
teeth
chattering
with
*NL*
cold
and
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Aunt
Josephine
,
''
said
Diana
,
gasping
with
laughter
.
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
*NL*
it
was
Aunt
Josephine
,
however
she
came
to
be
there
.
Oh
,
and
I
know
she
*NL*
will
be
furious
.
It
's
dreadful
--
it
's
really
dreadful
--
but
did
you
ever
*NL*
know
anything
so
funny
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
your
Aunt
Josephine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
father
's
aunt
and
she
lives
in
Charlottetown
.
She
's
awfully
*NL*
old
--
seventy
anyhow
--
and
I
do
n't
believe
she
was
EVER
a
little
girl
.
We
*NL*
were
expecting
her
out
for
a
visit
,
but
not
so
soon
.
She
's
awfully
prim
*NL*
and
proper
and
she
'll
scold
dreadfully
about
this
,
I
know
.
Well
,
we
'll
*NL*
have
to
sleep
with
Minnie
May
--
and
you
ca
n't
think
how
she
kicks

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Josephine
Barry
did
not
appear
at
the
early
breakfast
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
Mrs.
Barry
smiled
kindly
at
the
two
little
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
a
good
time
last
night
?
I
tried
to
stay
awake
until
you
*NL*
came
home
,
for
I
wanted
to
tell
you
Aunt
Josephine
had
come
and
that
you
*NL*
would
have
to
go
upstairs
after
all
,
but
I
was
so
tired
I
fell
asleep
.
I
*NL*
hope
you
did
n't
disturb
your
aunt
,
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
preserved
a
discreet
silence
,
but
she
and
Anne
exchanged
furtive
*NL*
smiles
of
guilty
amusement
across
the
table
.
Anne
hurried
home
after
*NL*
breakfast
and
so
remained
in
blissful
ignorance
of
the
disturbance
which
*NL*
presently
resulted
in
the
Barry
household
until
the
late
afternoon
,
when
*NL*
she
went
down
to
Mrs.
Lynde
's
on
an
errand
for
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
and
Diana
nearly
frightened
poor
old
Miss
Barry
to
death
last
*NL*
night
?

said
Mrs.
Lynde
severely
,
but
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
.
``
Mrs.
*NL*
Barry
was
here
a
few
minutes
ago
on
her
way
to
Carmody
.
She
's
feeling
*NL*
real
worried
over
it
.
Old
Miss
Barry
was
in
a
terrible
temper
when
she
*NL*
got
up
this
morning
--
and
Josephine
Barry
's
temper
is
no
joke
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
that

She
would
n't
speak
to
Diana
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
Diana
's
fault

''
said
Anne
contritely
.
``
It
was
mine

I
*NL*
suggested
racing
to
see
who
would
get
into
bed
first

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it

said
Mrs.
Lynde
,
with
the
exultation
of
a
correct
guesser

*NL*
``
I
knew
that
idea
came
out

it
's
made
a
nice
lot
of
*NL*
trouble
,
that
's
what
.
Old
Miss
Barry
came
out
to
stay
for
a
month
,
but
*NL*
she
declares
she
wo
n't
stay
another
day
and
is
going
right
back
to
town
*NL*
tomorrow
,
Sunday
and
all
as
it
is
.
She
'd
have
gone
today
if
they
could
*NL*
have
taken
her
.
She
had
promised
to
pay
for
a
quarter
's
music
lessons
*NL*
for
Diana
,
but
now
she
is
determined
to
do
nothing
at
all
for
such
a
*NL*
tomboy
.
Oh
,
I
guess
they
had
a
lively
time
of
it
there
this
morning
.
The
*NL*
Barrys
must
feel
cut
up
.
Old
Miss
Barry
is
rich
and
they
'd
like
to
keep
*NL*
on
the
good
side
of
her
.
Of
course
,
Mrs.
Barry
did
n't
say
just
that
to
*NL*
me
,
but
I
'm
a
pretty
good
judge
of
human
nature
,
that
's
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
such
an
unlucky
girl
,
''
mourned
Anne
.
``
I
'm
always
getting
into
*NL*
scrapes
myself
and
getting
my
best
friends
--
people
I
'd
shed
my
heart
's
*NL*
blood
for
--
into
them
too
.
Can
you
tell
me
why
it
is
so
,
Mrs.
Lynde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
you
're
too
heedless
and
impulsive
,
child
,
that
's
what
.
You
*NL*
never
stop
to
think
--
whatever
comes
into
your
head
to
say
or
do
you
say
*NL*
or
do
it
without
a
moment
's
reflection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
that
's
the
best
of
it
,
''
protested
Anne
.
``
Something
just
flashes
*NL*
into
your
mind
,
so
exciting
,
and
you
must
out
with
it
.
If
you
stop
to
*NL*
think
it
over
you
spoil
it
all
.
Have
n't
you
never
felt
that
yourself
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
Mrs.
Lynde
had
not
.
She
shook
her
head
sagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
learn
to
think
a
little
,
Anne
,
that
's
what
.
The
proverb
you
*NL*
need
to
go
by
is
`
Look
before
you
leap
'
--
especially
into
spare-room
*NL*
beds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
laughed
comfortably
over
her
mild
joke
,
but
Anne
remained
*NL*
pensive
.
She
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
in
the
situation
,
which
to
her
*NL*
eyes
appeared
very
serious
.
When
she
left
Mrs.
Lynde
's
she
took
her
way
*NL*
across
the
crusted
fields
to
Orchard
Slope
.
Diana
met
her
at
the
kitchen
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Aunt
Josephine
was
very
cross
about
it
,
was
n't
she
?
''
whispered
*NL*
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Diana
,
stifling
a
giggle
with
an
apprehensive
glance
*NL*
over
her
shoulder
at
the
closed
sitting-room
door
.
``
She
was
fairly
*NL*
dancing
with
rage
,
Anne
.
Oh
,
how
she
scolded
.
She
said
I
was
the
*NL*
worst-behaved
girl
she
ever
saw
and
that
my
parents
ought
to
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
the
way
they
had
brought
me
up
.
She
says
she
wo
n't
stay
and
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
do
n't
care
.
But
Father
and
Mother
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
them
it
was
my
fault
?
''
demanded
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
likely
I
'd
do
such
a
thing
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Diana
with
just
scorn
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
no
telltale
,
Anne
Shirley
,
and
anyhow
I
was
just
as
much
to
blame
*NL*
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
going
in
to
tell
her
myself
,
''
said
Anne
resolutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
stared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
you
'd
never
!
why
--
she
'll
eat
you
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
frighten
me
any
more
than
I
am
frightened
,
''
implored
Anne
.
``
I
'd
*NL*
rather
walk
up
to
a
cannon
's
mouth
.
But
I
've
got
to
do
it
,
Diana
.
It
*NL*
was
my
fault
and
I
've
got
to
confess
.
I
've
had
practice
in
confessing
,
*NL*
fortunately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
in
the
room
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
You
can
go
in
if
you
want
to
.
I
*NL*
would
n't
dare
.
And
I
do
n't
believe
you
'll
do
a
bit
of
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
encouragement
Anne
bearded
the
lion
in
its
den
--
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
walked
resolutely
up
to
the
sitting-room
door
and
knocked
faintly
.
*NL*
A
sharp
``
Come
in
''
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Josephine
Barry
,
thin
,
prim
,
and
rigid
,
was
knitting
fiercely
by
*NL*
the
fire
,
her
wrath
quite
unappeased
and
her
eyes
snapping
through
her
*NL*
gold-rimmed
glasses
.
She
wheeled
around
in
her
chair
,
expecting
to
see
*NL*
Diana
,
and
beheld
a
white-faced
girl
whose
great
eyes
were
brimmed
up
*NL*
with
a
mixture
of
desperate
courage
and
shrinking
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
demanded
Miss
Josephine
Barry
,
without
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
Anne
of
Green
Gables
,
''
said
the
small
visitor
tremulously
,
clasping
*NL*
her
hands
with
her
characteristic
gesture
,
``
and
I
've
come
to
confess
,
if
*NL*
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Confess
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
was
all
my
fault
about
jumping
into
bed
on
you
last
night
.
I
*NL*
suggested
it
.
Diana
would
never
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
,
I
am
sure
.
*NL*
Diana
is
a
very
ladylike
girl
,
Miss
Barry
.
So
you
must
see
how
unjust
it
*NL*
is
to
blame
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
must
,
hey
?
I
rather
think
Diana
did
her
share
of
the
jumping
at
*NL*
least
.
Such
carryings
on
in
a
respectable
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
were
only
in
fun
,
''
persisted
Anne
.
``
I
think
you
ought
to
forgive
*NL*
us
,
Miss
Barry
,
now
that
we
've
apologized
.
And
anyhow
,
please
forgive
*NL*
Diana
and
let
her
have
her
music
lessons
.
Diana
's
heart
is
set
on
her
*NL*
music
lessons
,
Miss
Barry
,
and
I
know
too
well
what
it
is
to
set
your
*NL*
heart
on
a
thing
and
not
get
it
.
If
you
must
be
cross
with
anyone
,
be
*NL*
cross
with
me
.
I
've
been
so
used
in
my
early
days
to
having
people
cross
*NL*
at
me
that
I
can
endure
it
much
better
than
Diana
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Much
of
the
snap
had
gone
out
of
the
old
lady
's
eyes
by
this
time
*NL*
and
was
replaced
by
a
twinkle
of
amused
interest
.
But
she
still
said
*NL*
severely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
is
any
excuse
for
you
that
you
were
only
in
fun
.
*NL*
Little
girls
never
indulged
in
that
kind
of
fun
when
I
was
young
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
awakened
out
of
a
sound
sleep
,
after
a
long
*NL*
and
arduous
journey
,
by
two
great
girls
coming
bounce
down
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
KNOW
,
but
I
can
IMAGINE
,
''
said
Anne
eagerly
.
``
I
'm
sure
it
must
*NL*
have
been
very
disturbing
.
But
then
,
there
is
our
side
of
it
too
.
Have
*NL*
you
any
imagination
,
Miss
Barry
?
If
you
have
,
just
put
yourself
in
*NL*
our
place
.
We
did
n't
know
there
was
anybody
in
that
bed
and
you
nearly
*NL*
scared
us
to
death
.
It
was
simply
awful
the
way
we
felt
.
And
then
we
*NL*
could
n't
sleep
in
the
spare
room
after
being
promised
.
I
suppose
you
are
*NL*
used
to
sleeping
in
spare
rooms
.
But
just
imagine
what
you
would
feel
*NL*
like
if
you
were
a
little
orphan
girl
who
had
never
had
such
an
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
snap
had
gone
by
this
time
.
Miss
Barry
actually
laughed
--
a
*NL*
sound
which
caused
Diana
,
waiting
in
speechless
anxiety
in
the
kitchen
*NL*
outside
,
to
give
a
great
gasp
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
my
imagination
is
a
little
rusty
--
it
's
so
long
since
I
used
*NL*
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
dare
say
your
claim
to
sympathy
is
just
as
strong
as
*NL*
mine
.
It
all
depends
on
the
way
we
look
at
it
.
Sit
down
here
and
tell
me
*NL*
about
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Anne
firmly
.
``
I
would
like
to
,
because
*NL*
you
seem
like
an
interesting
lady
,
and
you
might
even
be
a
kindred
*NL*
spirit
although
you
do
n't
look
very
much
like
it
.
But
it
is
my
duty
to
*NL*
go
home
to
Miss
Marilla
Cuthbert
.
Miss
Marilla
Cuthbert
is
a
very
kind
*NL*
lady
who
has
taken
me
to
bring
up
properly
.
She
is
doing
her
best
,
but
*NL*
it
is
very
discouraging
work
.
You
must
not
blame
her
because
I
jumped
on
*NL*
the
bed
.
But
before
I
go
I
do
wish
you
would
tell
me
if
you
will
forgive
*NL*
Diana
and
stay
just
as
long
as
you
meant
to
in
Avonlea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
perhaps
I
will
if
you
will
come
over
and
talk
to
me
*NL*
occasionally
,
''
said
Miss
Barry
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Miss
Barry
gave
Diana
a
silver
bangle
bracelet
and
told
the
*NL*
senior
members
of
the
household
that
she
had
unpacked
her
valise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
simply
for
the
sake
of
getting
better
*NL*
acquainted
with
that
Anne-girl
,
''
she
said
frankly
.
``
She
amuses
me
,
and
*NL*
at
my
time
of
life
an
amusing
person
is
a
rarity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
's
only
comment
when
she
heard
the
story
was
,
``
I
told
you
so
.
''
*NL*
This
was
for
Matthew
's
benefit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Barry
stayed
her
month
out
and
over
.
She
was
a
more
agreeable
guest
*NL*
than
usual
,
for
Anne
kept
her
in
good
humor
.
They
became
firm
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Barry
went
away
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
you
Anne-girl
,
when
you
come
to
town
you
're
to
visit
me

*NL*
I
'll
put
you
in
my
very
sparest
spare-room
bed
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Barry
was
a
kindred
spirit
,
after
all
,
''
Anne
confided
to
Marilla
.
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
think
so
to
look
at
her

but
she
is

You
do
n't
find
it
*NL*
right
out
at
first
,
as
in
Matthew
's
case
,
but
after
a
while
you
come
*NL*
to
see
it
.
Kindred
spirits
are
not
so
scarce
as
I
used
to
think

It
's
*NL*
splendid
to
find
out
there

many

CHAPTER
XX
.
A
Good
Imagination
Gone
Wrong
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
had
come
once
more
to
Green
Gables
--
the
beautiful
capricious
,
*NL*
reluctant
Canadian
spring
,
lingering
along
through
April
and
May
in
a
*NL*
succession
of
sweet
,
fresh
,
chilly
days
,
with
pink
sunsets
and
miracles
*NL*
of
resurrection
and
growth
.
The
maples
in
Lover
's
Lane
were
red
budded
*NL*
and
little
curly
ferns
pushed
up
around
the
Dryad
's
Bubble
.
Away
up
in
*NL*
the
barrens
,
behind
Mr.
Silas
Sloane
's
place
,
the
Mayflowers
blossomed
*NL*
out
,
pink
and
white
stars
of
sweetness
under
their
brown
leaves
.
All
the
*NL*
school
girls
and
boys
had
one
golden
afternoon
gathering
them
,
coming
*NL*
home
in
the
clear
,
echoing
twilight
with
arms
and
baskets
full
of
*NL*
flowery
spoil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
sorry
for
people
who
live
in
lands
where
there
are
no
*NL*
Mayflowers
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
Diana
says
perhaps
they
have
something
better
,
*NL*
but
there
could
n't
be
anything
better
than
Mayflowers
,
could
there
,
*NL*
Marilla
?
And
Diana
says
if
they
do
n't
know
what
they
are
like
they
do
n't
*NL*
miss
them
.
But
I
think
that
is
the
saddest
thing
of
all
.
I
think
it
*NL*
would
be
TRAGIC
,
Marilla
,
not
to
know
what
Mayflowers
are
like
and
NOT
*NL*
to
miss
them
.
Do
you
know
what
I
think
Mayflowers
are
,
Marilla
?
I
think
*NL*
they
must
be
the
souls
of
the
flowers
that
died
last
summer
and
this
*NL*
is
their
heaven
.
But
we
had
a
splendid
time
today
,
Marilla
.
We
had
our
*NL*
lunch
down
in
a
big
mossy
hollow
by
an
old
well
--
such
a
ROMANTIC
spot
.
*NL*
Charlie
Sloane
dared
Arty
Gillis
to
jump
over
it
,
and
Arty
did
because
*NL*
he
would
n't
take
a
dare
.
Nobody
would
in
school
.
It
is
very
FASHIONABLE
*NL*
to
dare
.
Mr.
Phillips
gave
all
the
Mayflowers
he
found
to
Prissy
Andrews
*NL*
and
I
heard
him
to
say
`
sweets
to
the
sweet
.
'
He
got
that
out
of
a
*NL*
book
,
I
know
;
but
it
shows
he
has
some
imagination
.
I
was
offered
some
*NL*
Mayflowers
too
,
but
I
rejected
them
with
scorn
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
the
*NL*
person
's
name
because
I
have
vowed
never
to
let
it
cross
my
lips
.
We
*NL*
made
wreaths
of
the
Mayflowers
and
put
them
on
our
hats
;
and
when
the
*NL*
time
came
to
go
home
we
marched
in
procession
down
the
road
,
two
by
two
,
*NL*
with
our
bouquets
and
wreaths
,
singing
`
My
Home
on
the
Hill
.
'
Oh
,
it
was
*NL*
so
thrilling
,
Marilla
.
All
Mr.
Silas
Sloane
's
folks
rushed
out
to
see
us
*NL*
and
everybody
we
met
on
the
road
stopped
and
stared
after
us
.
We
made
a
*NL*
real
sensation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
wonder
!
Such
silly
doings
!
''
was
Marilla
's
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
Mayflowers
came
the
violets
,
and
Violet
Vale
was
empurpled
*NL*
with
them
.
Anne
walked
through
it
on
her
way
to
school
with
reverent
*NL*
steps
and
worshiping
eyes
,
as
if
she
trod
on
holy
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somehow
,
''
she
told
Diana
,
``
when
I
'm
going
through
here
I
do
n't
really
*NL*
care
whether
Gil
--
whether
anybody
gets
ahead
of
me
in
class
or
not
.
But
*NL*
when
I
'm
up
in
school
it
's
all
different
and
I
care
as
much
as
ever
.
*NL*
There
's
such
a
lot
of
different
Annes
in
me
.
I
sometimes
think
that
is
*NL*
why
I
'm
such
a
troublesome
person
.
If
I
was
just
the
one
Anne
it
would
*NL*
be
ever
so
much
more
comfortable
,
but
then
it
would
n't
be
half
so
*NL*
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
June
evening
,
when
the
orchards
were
pink
blossomed
again
,
when
the
*NL*
frogs
were
singing
silverly
sweet
in
the
marshes
about
the
head
of
the
*NL*
Lake
of
Shining
Waters
,
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
savor
of
clover
*NL*
fields
and
balsamic
fir
woods
,
Anne
was
sitting
by
her
gable
window
.
*NL*
She
had
been
studying
her
lessons
,
but
it
had
grown
too
dark
to
see
the
*NL*
book
,
so
she
had
fallen
into
wide-eyed
reverie
,
looking
out
past
the
*NL*
boughs
of
the
Snow
Queen
,
once
more
bestarred
with
its
tufts
of
blossom
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
essential
respects
the
little
gable
chamber
was
unchanged
.
The
*NL*
walls
were
as
white
,
the
pincushion
as
hard
,
the
chairs
as
stiffly
*NL*
and
yellowly
upright
as
ever
.
Yet
the
whole
character
of
the
room
was
*NL*
altered
.
It
was
full
of
a
new
vital
,
pulsing
personality
that
seemed
to
*NL*
pervade
it
and
to
be
quite
independent
of
schoolgirl
books
and
dresses
*NL*
and
ribbons
,
and
even
of
the
cracked
blue
jug
full
of
apple
blossoms
*NL*
on
the
table
.
It
was
as
if
all
the
dreams
,
sleeping
and
waking
,
of
its
*NL*
vivid
occupant
had
taken
a
visible
although
unmaterial
form
and
had
*NL*
tapestried
the
bare
room
with
splendid
filmy
tissues
of
rainbow
and
*NL*
moonshine
.
Presently
Marilla
came
briskly
in
with
some
of
Anne
's
freshly
*NL*
ironed
school
aprons
.
She
hung
them
over
a
chair
and
sat
down
with
*NL*
a
short
sigh
.
She
had
had
one
of
her
headaches
that
afternoon
,
and
*NL*
although
the
pain
had
gone
she
felt
weak
and
``
tuckered
out
,
''
as
she
*NL*
expressed
it
.
Anne
looked
at
her
with
eyes
limpid
with
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
truly
wish
I
could
have
had
the
headache
in
your
place
,
Marilla
.
I
*NL*
would
have
endured
it
joyfully
for
your
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
did
your
part
in
attending
to
the
work
and
letting
me
*NL*
rest
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
You
seem
to
have
got
on
fairly
well
and
made
fewer
*NL*
mistakes
than
usual
.
Of
course
it
was
n't
exactly
necessary
to
starch
*NL*
Matthew
's
handkerchiefs
!
And
most
people
when
they
put
a
pie
in
the
oven
*NL*
to
warm
up
for
dinner
take
it
out
and
eat
it
when
it
gets
hot
instead
of
*NL*
leaving
it
to
be
burned
to
a
crisp
.
But
that
does
n't
seem
to
be
your
way
*NL*
evidently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Headaches
always
left
Marilla
somewhat
sarcastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
sorry
,
''
said
Anne
penitently
.
``
I
never
thought
about
that
*NL*
pie
from
the
moment
I
put
it
in
the
oven
till
now
,
although
I
felt
*NL*
INSTINCTIVELY
that
there
was
something
missing
on
the
dinner
table
.
I
*NL*
was
firmly
resolved
,
when
you
left
me
in
charge
this
morning
,
not
to
*NL*
imagine
anything
,
but
keep
my
thoughts
on
facts
.
I
did
pretty
well
until
*NL*
I
put
the
pie
in
,
and
then
an
irresistible
temptation
came
to
me
to
*NL*
imagine
I
was
an
enchanted
princess
shut
up
in
a
lonely
tower
with
a
*NL*
handsome
knight
riding
to
my
rescue
on
a
coal-black
steed
.
So
that
*NL*
is
how
I
came
to
forget
the
pie
.
I
did
n't
know
I
starched
the
*NL*
handkerchiefs
.
All
the
time
I
was
ironing
I
was
trying
to
think
of
a
*NL*
name
for
a
new
island
Diana
and
I
have
discovered
up
the
brook
.
It
's
the
*NL*
most
ravishing
spot
,
Marilla
.
There
are
two
maple
trees
on
it
and
the
*NL*
brook
flows
right
around
it
.
At
last
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
*NL*
splendid
to
call
it
Victoria
Island
because
we
found
it
on
the
Queen
's
*NL*
birthday
.
Both
Diana
and
I
are
very
loyal
.
But
I
'm
sorry
about
that
pie
*NL*
and
the
handkerchiefs
.
I
wanted
to
be
extra
good
today
because
it
's
an
*NL*
anniversary
.
Do
you
remember
what
happened
this
day
last
year
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
think
of
anything
special
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
was
the
day
I
came
to
Green
Gables
.
I
shall
never
*NL*
forget
it
.
It
was
the
turning
point
in
my
life
.
Of
course
it
would
n't
*NL*
seem
so
important
to
you
.
I
've
been
here
for
a
year
and
I
've
been
so
*NL*
happy
.
Of
course
,
I
've
had
my
troubles

but
one
can
live
down
troubles

*NL*
Are
you
sorry

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
ca
n't
say
I
'm
sorry

''
said
Marilla
,
who
sometimes
wondered
how
*NL*
she
could
have
lived
before
Anne
came
to
Green
Gables
,
``
no
,
not
exactly
*NL*
sorry

If
you
've
finished
your
lessons

Anne
,
I
want
you
to
run
over
and
*NL*
ask
Mrs.
Barry
if
she
'll
lend
me
Diana

apron
pattern
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
it
's
--
it
's
too
dark

''
cried
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
dark
?
Why

it
's
only
twilight

And
goodness
knows
you
've
gone
over
*NL*
often
enough
after
dark

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
over
early
in
the
morning

Anne
eagerly
.

I
'll
get
up
at
*NL*
sunrise
and
go
over

Marilla

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
got
into
your
head
now

Go
at

be
smart

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
to
go
around
by
the
road
,
then
,

said
Anne
,
taking
up
her
hat
*NL*
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
by
the
road
and
waste
half
an
hour
!
I
'd
like
to
catch
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
go
through
the
Haunted
Wood

Marilla

cried
Anne
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
stared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Haunted
Wood
!
Are
you
crazy
?
What
under
the
canopy
is
the
Haunted
*NL*
Wood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spruce
wood
over
the
brook
,
''
said
Anne
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiddlesticks
!
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
haunted
wood
anywhere
.
Who
*NL*
has
been
telling
you
such
stuff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
,
''
confessed
Anne
.
``
Diana
and
I
just
imagined
the
wood
was
*NL*
haunted
.
All
the
places
around
here
are
so
--
so
--
COMMONPLACE
.
We
just
got
*NL*
this
up
for
our
own
amusement
.
We
began
it
in
April
.
A
haunted
wood
is
*NL*
so
very
romantic
,
Marilla
.
We
chose
the
spruce
grove
because
it
's
so
*NL*
gloomy
.
Oh
,
we
have
imagined
the
most
harrowing
things
.
There
's
a
white
*NL*
lady
walks
along
the
brook
just
about
this
time
of
the
night
and
wrings
*NL*
her
hands
and
utters
wailing
cries
.
She
appears
when
there
is
to
be
a
*NL*
death
in
the
family
.
And
the
ghost
of
a
little
murdered
child
haunts
the
*NL*
corner
up
by
Idlewild
;
it
creeps
up
behind
you
and
lays
its
cold
fingers
*NL*
on
your
hand
--
so
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
gives
me
a
shudder
to
think
of
it
.
And
*NL*
there
's
a
headless
man
stalks
up
and
down
the
path
and
skeletons
glower
*NL*
at
you
between
the
boughs
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
would
n't
go
through
the
*NL*
Haunted
Wood
after
dark
now
for
anything
.
I
'd
be
sure
that
white
things
*NL*
would
reach
out
from
behind
the
trees
and
grab
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
anyone
hear
the
like
!
''
ejaculated
Marilla
,
who
had
*NL*
listened
in
dumb
amazement
.
``
Anne
Shirley
,
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
*NL*
believe
all
that
wicked
nonsense
of
your
own
imagination
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
believe
EXACTLY
,
''
faltered
Anne
.
``
At
least
,
I
do
n't
believe
it
in
*NL*
daylight
.
But
after
dark
,
Marilla
,
it
's
different
.
That
is
when
ghosts
*NL*
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
such
things
as
ghosts
,
Anne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
there
are
,
Marilla
,
''
cried
Anne
eagerly
.
``
I
know
people
who
*NL*
have
seen
them
.
And
they
are
respectable
people
.
Charlie
Sloane
says
*NL*
that
his
grandmother
saw
his
grandfather
driving
home
the
cows
one
night
*NL*
after
he
'd
been
buried
for
a
year
.
You
know
Charlie
Sloane
's
grandmother
*NL*
would
n't
tell
a
story
for
anything
.
She
's
a
very
religious
woman
.
And
*NL*
Mrs.
Thomas
's
father
was
pursued
home
one
night
by
a
lamb
of
fire
with
*NL*
its
head
cut
off
hanging
by
a
strip
of
skin
.
He
said
he
knew
it
was
the
*NL*
spirit
of
his
brother
and
that
it
was
a
warning
he
would
die
within
nine
*NL*
days
.
He
did
n't
,
but
he
died
two
years
after
,
so
you
see
it
was
really
*NL*
true
.
And
Ruby
Gillis
says
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
''
interrupted
Marilla
firmly
,
``
I
never
want
to
hear
you
*NL*
talking
in
this
fashion
again

I
've
had
my
doubts
about
that
imagination
*NL*
of
yours
right
along
,
and
if
this
is
going
to
be
the
outcome
of
it
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
countenance
any
such
doings

You
'll
go
right
over
to
Barry
's
,
and
*NL*
you
'll
go
through
that
spruce
grove
,
just
for
a
lesson
and
a
warning
to
*NL*
you
.
And
never
let
me
hear
a
word
out
of
your
head
about
haunted
woods
*NL*
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
might
plead
and
cry
as
she
liked
--
and
did
,
for
her
terror
was
very
*NL*
real
.
Her
imagination
had
run
away
with
her
and
she
held
the
spruce
*NL*
grove
in
mortal
dread
after
nightfall
.
But
Marilla
was
inexorable
.
She
*NL*
marched
the
shrinking
ghost-seer
down
to
the
spring
and
ordered
her
*NL*
to
proceed
straightaway
over
the
bridge
and
into
the
dusky
retreats
of
*NL*
wailing
ladies
and
headless
specters
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
?
''
sobbed
Anne
.
``
What
would
you
*NL*
feel
like
if
a
white
thing
did
snatch
me
up
and
carry
me
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
risk
it
,
''
said
Marilla
unfeelingly
.
``
You
know
I
always
mean
what
I
*NL*
say
.
I
'll
cure
you
of
imagining
ghosts
into
places
.
March
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
marched
.
That
is
,
she
stumbled
over
the
bridge
and
went
shuddering
*NL*
up
the
horrible
dim
path
beyond
.
Anne
never
forgot
that
walk
.
Bitterly
*NL*
did
she
repent
the
license
she
had
given
to
her
imagination
.
The
goblins
*NL*
of
her
fancy
lurked
in
every
shadow
about
her
,
reaching
out
their
cold
,
*NL*
fleshless
hands
to
grasp
the
terrified
small
girl
who
had
called
them
*NL*
into
being
.
A
white
strip
of
birch
bark
blowing
up
from
the
hollow
over
*NL*
the
brown
floor
of
the
grove
made
her
heart
stand
still
.
The
long-drawn
*NL*
wail
of
two
old
boughs
rubbing
against
each
other
brought
out
the
*NL*
perspiration
in
beads
on
her
forehead
.
The
swoop
of
bats
in
the
darkness
*NL*
over
her
was
as
the
wings
of
unearthly
creatures
.
When
she
reached
Mr.
*NL*
William
Bell
's
field
she
fled
across
it
as
if
pursued
by
an
army
of
*NL*
white
things
,
and
arrived
at
the
Barry
kitchen
door
so
out
of
breath
*NL*
that
she
could
hardly
gasp
out
her
request
for
the
apron
pattern
.
*NL*
Diana
was
away
so
that
she
had
no
excuse
to
linger
.
The
dreadful
*NL*
return
journey
had
to
be
faced
.
Anne
went
back
over
it
with
shut
eyes
,
*NL*
preferring
to
take
the
risk
of
dashing
her
brains
out
among
the
boughs
*NL*
to
that
of
seeing
a
white
thing
.
When
she
finally
stumbled
over
the
log
*NL*
bridge
she
drew
one
long
shivering
breath
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
nothing
caught
you
?
''
said
Marilla
unsympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mar
--
Marilla

''
chattered
Anne
,
``
I
'll
b-b-be
contt-tented
with

c-c-commonplace
places
after
this

down
on

table
on
the

wiping

handkerchief

I
was
crying
because
I
was
really
so
very
fond
of
him
,
''
*NL*
reflected
Anne
.
``
I
just
cried
because
all
the
others
did
.
It
was
*NL*
Ruby
Gillis
started
it
.
Ruby
Gillis
has
always
declared
she
hated
Mr.
*NL*
Phillips
,
but
just
as
soon
as
he
got
up
to
make
his
farewell
speech
she
*NL*
burst
into
tears
.
Then
all
the
girls
began
to
cry
,
one
after
the
other
.
*NL*
I
tried
to
hold
out
,
Marilla
.
I
tried
to
remember
the
time
Mr.
Phillips
*NL*
made
me
sit
with
Gil
--
with
a
,
boy
;
and
the
time
he
spelled
my
name
*NL*
without
an
e
on
the
blackboard
;
and
how
he
said
I
was
the
worst
dunce
*NL*
he
ever
saw
at
geometry
and
laughed
at
my
spelling
;
and
all
the
times
he
*NL*
had
been
so
horrid
and
sarcastic
;
but
somehow
I
could
n't
,
Marilla
,
and
I
*NL*
just
had
to
cry
too
.
Jane
Andrews
has
been
talking
for
a
month
about
how
*NL*
glad
she
'd
be
when
Mr.
Phillips
went
away
and
she
declared
she
'd
never
*NL*
shed
a
tear
.
Well
,
she
was
worse
than
any
of
us
and
had
to
borrow
a
*NL*
handkerchief
from
her
brother
--
of
course
the
boys
did
n't
cry
--
because
*NL*
she
had
n't
brought
one
of
her
own
,
not
expecting
to
need
it
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
it
was
heartrending
.
Mr.
Phillips
made
such
a
beautiful
*NL*
farewell
speech
beginning
,
`
The
time
has
come
for
us
to
part
.
'
It
was
*NL*
very
affecting
.
And
he
had
tears
in
his
eyes
too
,
Marilla
.
Oh
,
I
felt
*NL*
dreadfully
sorry
and
remorseful
for
all
the
times
I
'd
talked
in
school
*NL*
and
drawn
pictures
of
him
on
my
slate
and
made
fun
of
him
and
Prissy
.
*NL*
I
can
tell
you
I
wished
I
'd
been
a
model
pupil
like
Minnie
Andrews
.
She
*NL*
had
n't
anything
on
her
conscience
.
The
girls
cried
all
the
way
home
from
*NL*
school
.
Carrie
Sloane
kept
saying
every
few
minutes
,
`
The
time
has
come
*NL*
for
us
to
part
,
'
and
that
would
start
us
off
again
whenever
we
were
in
*NL*
any
danger
of
cheering
up
.
I
do
feel
dreadfully
sad
,
Marilla
.
But
one
*NL*
ca
n't
feel
quite
in
the
depths
of
despair
with
two
months
'
vacation
*NL*
before
them
,
can
they
,
Marilla
?
And
besides
,
we
met
the
new
minister
and
*NL*
his
wife
coming
from
the
station
.
For
all
I
was
feeling
so
bad
about
Mr.
*NL*
Phillips
going
away
I
could
n't
help
taking
a
little
interest
in
a
new
*NL*
minister
,
could
I
?
His
wife
is
very
pretty
.
Not
exactly
regally
lovely
,
*NL*
of
course
--
it
would
n't
do
,
I
suppose
,
for
a
minister
to
have
a
regally
*NL*
lovely
wife
,
because
it
might
set
a
bad
example
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
the
*NL*
minister
's
wife
over
at
Newbridge
sets
a
very
bad
example
because
she
*NL*
dresses
so
fashionably
.
Our
new
minister
's
wife
was
dressed
in
blue
*NL*
muslin
with
lovely
puffed
sleeves
and
a
hat
trimmed
with
roses
.
*NL*
Jane
Andrews
said
she
thought
puffed
sleeves
were
too
worldly
for
*NL*
a
minister
's
wife
,
but
I
did
n't
make
any
such
uncharitable
remark
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
because
I
know
what
it
is
to
long
for
puffed
sleeves
.
Besides
,
*NL*
she
's
only
been
a
minister
's
wife
for
a
little
while
,
so
one
should
*NL*
make
allowances
,
should
n't
they
?
They
are
going
to
board
with
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
until
the
manse
is
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Marilla
,
in
going
down
to
Mrs.
Lynde
's
that
evening
,
was
actuated
by
*NL*
any
motive
save
her
avowed
one
of
returning
the
quilting
frames
she
had
*NL*
borrowed
the
preceding
winter
,
it
was
an
amiable
weakness
shared
by
most
*NL*
of
the
Avonlea
people
.
Many
a
thing
Mrs.
Lynde
had
lent
,
sometimes
*NL*
never
expecting
to
see
it
again
,
came
home
that
night
in
charge
of
the
*NL*
borrowers
thereof
.
A
new
minister
,
and
moreover
a
minister
with
a
wife
,
*NL*
was
a
lawful
object
of
curiosity
in
a
quiet
little
country
settlement
*NL*
where
sensations
were
few
and
far
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr.
Bentley
,
the
minister
whom
Anne
had
found
lacking
in
*NL*
imagination
,
had
been
pastor
of
Avonlea
for
eighteen
years
.
He
was
a
*NL*
widower
when
he
came
,
and
a
widower
he
remained
,
despite
the
fact
that
*NL*
gossip
regularly
married
him
to
this
,
that
,
or
the
other
one
,
every
year
*NL*
of
his
sojourn
.
In
the
preceding
February
he
had
resigned
his
charge
and
*NL*
departed
amid
the
regrets
of
his
people
,
most
of
whom
had
the
affection
*NL*
born
of
long
intercourse
for
their
good
old
minister
in
spite
of
his
*NL*
shortcomings
as
an
orator
.
Since
then
the
Avonlea
church
had
enjoyed
a
*NL*
variety
of
religious
dissipation
in
listening
to
the
many
and
various
*NL*
candidates
and
``
supplies
''
who
came
Sunday
after
Sunday
to
preach
on
*NL*
trial
.
These
stood
or
fell
by
the
judgment
of
the
fathers
and
mothers
*NL*
in
Israel
;
but
a
certain
small
,
red-haired
girl
who
sat
meekly
in
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
old
Cuthbert
pew
also
had
her
opinions
about
them
and
*NL*
discussed
the
same
in
full
with
Matthew
,
Marilla
always
declining
from
*NL*
principle
to
criticize
ministers
in
any
shape
or
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
Mr.
Smith
would
have
done
,
Matthew
''
was
Anne
's
final
*NL*
summing
up
.
``
Mrs.
Lynde
says
his
delivery
was
so
poor
,
but
I
think
his
*NL*
worst
fault
was
just
like
Mr.
Bentley
's
--
he
had
no
imagination
.
And
Mr.
*NL*
Terry
had
too
much
;
he
let
it
run
away
with
him
just
as
I
did
mine
in
*NL*
the
matter
of
the
Haunted
Wood
.
Besides
,
Mrs.
Lynde
says
his
theology
*NL*
was
n't
sound
.
Mr.
Gresham
was
a
very
good
man
and
a
very
religious
man
,
*NL*
but
he
told
too
many
funny
stories
and
made
the
people
laugh
in
church
;
*NL*
he
was
undignified
,
and
you
must
have
some
dignity
about
a
minister
,
*NL*
must
n't
you
,
Matthew
?
I
thought
Mr.
Marshall
was
decidedly
attractive
;
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Lynde
says
he
is
n't
married
,
or
even
engaged
,
because
she
made
*NL*
special
inquiries
about
him
,
and
she
says
it
would
never
do
to
have
*NL*
a
young
unmarried
minister
in
Avonlea
,
because
he
might
marry
in
the
*NL*
congregation
and
that
would
make
trouble
.
Mrs.
Lynde
is
a
very
farseeing
*NL*
woman
,
is
n't
she
,
Matthew
?
I
'm
very
glad
they
've
called
Mr.
Allan
.
I
*NL*
liked
him
because
his
sermon
was
interesting
and
he
prayed
as
if
he
*NL*
meant
it
and
not
just
as
if
he
did
it
because
he
was
in
the
habit
of
it
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
says
he
is
n't
perfect
,
but
she
says
she
supposes
we
could
n't
*NL*
expect
a
perfect
minister
for
seven
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
,
*NL*
and
anyhow
his
theology
is
sound
because
she
questioned
him
thoroughly
*NL*
on
all
the
points
of
doctrine
.
And
she
knows
his
wife
's
people
and
they
*NL*
are
most
respectable
and
the
women
are
all
good
housekeepers
.
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
says
that
sound
doctrine
in
the
man
and
good
housekeeping
in
the
woman
*NL*
make
an
ideal
combination
for
a
minister
's
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
minister
and
his
wife
were
a
young
,
pleasant-faced
couple
,
still
*NL*
on
their
honeymoon
,
and
full
of
all
good
and
beautiful
enthusiasms
for
*NL*
their
chosen
lifework
.
Avonlea
opened
its
heart
to
them
from
the
start
.
*NL*
Old
and
young
liked
the
frank
,
cheerful
young
man
with
his
high
ideals
,
*NL*
and
the
bright
,
gentle
little
lady
who
assumed
the
mistress-ship
of
the
*NL*
manse
.
With
Mrs.
Allan
Anne
fell
promptly
and
wholeheartedly
in
love
.
*NL*
She
had
discovered
another
kindred
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Allan
is
perfectly
lovely
,
''
she
announced
one
Sunday
afternoon
.
*NL*
``
She
's
taken
our
class
and
she
's
a
splendid
teacher
.
She
said
right
away
*NL*
she
did
n't
think
it
was
fair
for
the
teacher
to
ask
all
the
questions
,
*NL*
and
you
know
,
Marilla
,
that
is
exactly
what
I
've
always
thought
.
She
*NL*
said
we
could
ask
her
any
question
we
liked
and
I
asked
ever
so
many
.
*NL*
I
'm
good
at
asking
questions
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
''
was
Marilla
's
emphatic
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
else
asked
any
except
Ruby
Gillis
,
and
she
asked
if
there
was
*NL*
to
be
a
Sunday-school
picnic
this
summer
.
I
did
n't
think
that
was
a
*NL*
very
proper
question
to
ask
because
it
had
n't
any
connection
with
the
*NL*
lesson
--
the
lesson
was
about
Daniel
in
the
lions
'
den
--
but
Mrs.
Allan
*NL*
just
smiled
and
said
she
thought
there
would
be
.
Mrs.
Allan
has
a
*NL*
lovely
smile
;
she
has
such
EXQUISITE
dimples
in
her
cheeks
.
I
wish
I
had
*NL*
dimples
in
my
cheeks
,
Marilla
.
I
'm
not
half
so
skinny
as
I
was
when
I
*NL*
came
here
,
but
I
have
no
dimples
yet
.
If
I
had
perhaps
I
could
influence
*NL*
people
for
good
.
Mrs.
Allan
said
we
ought
always
to
try
to
influence
*NL*
other
people
for
good
.
She
talked
so
nice
about
everything
.
I
never
knew
*NL*
before
that
religion
was
such
a
cheerful
thing
.
I
always
thought
it
*NL*
was
kind
of
melancholy
,
but
Mrs.
Allan
's
is
n't
,
and
I
'd
like
to
be
a
*NL*
Christian
if
I
could
be
one
like
her
.
I
would
n't
want
to
be
one
like
Mr.
*NL*
Superintendent
Bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
naughty
of
you
to
speak
so
about
Mr.
Bell
,
''
said
Marilla
*NL*
severely
.
``
Mr.
Bell
is
a
real
good
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
he
's
good
,
''
agreed
Anne
,
``
but
he
does
n't
seem
to
get
any
*NL*
comfort
out
of
it
.
If
I
could
be
good
I
'd
dance
and
sing
all
day
because
*NL*
I
was
glad
of
it
.
I
suppose
Mrs.
Allan
is
too
old
to
dance
and
sing
and
*NL*
of
course
it
would
n't
be
dignified
in
a
minister
's
wife
.
But
I
can
just
*NL*
feel
she
's
glad
she
's
a
Christian
and
that
she
'd
be
one
even
if
she
*NL*
could
get
to
heaven
without
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
must
have
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Allan
up
to
tea
someday
soon

said
*NL*
Marilla
reflectively
.
``
They
've
been
most
everywhere
but
here

Let
me
*NL*
see
.
Next
Wednesday
would
be
a
good
time
to
have
them

But
do
n't
say
a
*NL*
word
to
Matthew
about
it
,
for
if
he
knew
they
were
coming
he
'd
find
some
*NL*
excuse
to
be
away
that
day

He
'd
got
so
used
to
Mr.
Bentley
he
did
n't
*NL*
mind
him
,
but
he
's
going
to
find
it
hard
to
get
acquainted
with
a
new
*NL*
minister
,
and
a
new
minister

will
frighten
him
to
death

*NL*
``
I
'll
be

assured
Anne

will

you

You

promised
Marilla

*NL*
*NL*
Monday
and
Tuesday
great
preparations
went
on
at
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
Having
the
minister
and
his
wife
to
tea
was
a
serious
and
important
*NL*
undertaking
,
and
Marilla
was
determined
not
to
be
eclipsed
by
any
of
*NL*
the
Avonlea
housekeepers
.
Anne
was
wild
with
excitement
and
delight
.
She
*NL*
talked
it
all
over
with
Diana
Tuesday
night
in
the
twilight
,
as
they
*NL*
sat
on
the
big
red
stones
by
the
Dryad
's
Bubble
and
made
rainbows
in
the
*NL*
water
with
little
twigs
dipped
in
fir
balsam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
ready
,
Diana
,
except
my
cake
which
I
'm
to
make
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
and
the
baking-powder
biscuits
which
Marilla
will
make
just
*NL*
before
teatime
.
I
assure
you
,
Diana
,
that
Marilla
and
I
have
had
a
busy
*NL*
two
days
of
it
.
It
's
such
a
responsibility
having
a
minister
's
family
to
*NL*
tea
.
I
never
went
through
such
an
experience
before
.
You
should
just
see
*NL*
our
pantry
.
It
's
a
sight
to
behold
.
We
're
going
to
have
jellied
chicken
*NL*
and
cold
tongue
.
We
're
to
have
two
kinds
of
jelly
,
red
and
yellow
,
and
*NL*
whipped
cream
and
lemon
pie
,
and
cherry
pie
,
and
three
kinds
of
cookies
,
*NL*
and
fruit
cake
,
and
Marilla
's
famous
yellow
plum
preserves
that
she
*NL*
keeps
especially
for
ministers
,
and
pound
cake
and
layer
cake
,
and
*NL*
biscuits
as
aforesaid
;
and
new
bread
and
old
both
,
in
case
the
minister
*NL*
is
dyspeptic
and
ca
n't
eat
new
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
ministers
are
dyspeptic
,
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
think
Mr.
Allan
has
been
a
minister
long
enough
for
it
to
*NL*
have
had
a
bad
effect
on
him
.
I
just
grow
cold
when
I
think
of
my
layer
*NL*
cake
.
Oh
,
Diana
,
what
if
it
should
n't
be
good
!
I
dreamed
last
night
that
*NL*
I
was
chased
all
around
by
a
fearful
goblin
with
a
big
layer
cake
for
a
*NL*
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
good
,
all
right

assured
Diana
,
who
was
a
very
comfortable
*NL*
sort
of
friend
.
``
I
'm
sure
that
piece
of
the

you
made
that
we
had
for
*NL*
lunch
in
Idlewild
two
weeks
ago
was
perfectly
elegant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
cakes
have
such
a
terrible
habit
of
turning
out
bad
just
*NL*
when
you
especially
want
them
to
be
good
,
''
sighed
Anne
,
setting
a
*NL*
particularly
well-balsamed
twig
afloat
.
``
However
,
I
suppose
I
shall
*NL*
just
have
to
trust
to
Providence
and
be
careful
to
put
in
the
flour
.
Oh
,
*NL*
look
,
Diana
,
what
a
lovely
rainbow
!
Do
you
suppose
the
dryad
will
come
*NL*
out
after
we
go
away
and
take
it
for
a
scarf
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
dryad
,
''
said
Diana
.
Diana
's
mother
*NL*
had
found
out
about
the
Haunted
Wood
and
had
been
decidedly
angry
over
*NL*
it
.
As
a
result
Diana
had
abstained
from
any
further
imitative
flights
*NL*
of
imagination
and
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
*NL*
belief
even
in
harmless
dryads
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
so
easy
to
imagine
there
is
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
Every
night
before
*NL*
I
go
to
bed
,
I
look
out
of
my
window
and
wonder
if
the
dryad
is
really
*NL*
sitting
here
,
combing
her
locks
with
the
spring
for
a
mirror
.
Sometimes
*NL*
I
look
for
her
footprints
in
the
dew
in
the
morning
.
Oh
,
Diana
,
do
n't
*NL*
give
up
your
faith
in
the
dryad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wednesday
morning
came
.
Anne
got
up
at
sunrise
because
she
was
too
*NL*
excited
to
sleep
.
She
had
caught
a
severe
cold
in
the
head
by
reason
of
*NL*
her
dabbling
in
the
spring
on
the
preceding
evening
;
but
nothing
short
*NL*
of
absolute
pneumonia
could
have
quenched
her
interest
in
culinary
*NL*
matters
that
morning
.
After
breakfast
she
proceeded
to
make
her
cake
.
*NL*
When
she
finally
shut
the
oven
door
upon
it
she
drew
a
long
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
have
n't
forgotten
anything
this
time
,
Marilla
.
But
do
you
*NL*
think
it
will
rise
?
Just
suppose
perhaps
the
baking
powder
is
n't
good
?
I
*NL*
used
it
out
of
the
new
can
.
And
Mrs.
Lynde
says
you
can
never
be
sure
of
*NL*
getting
good
baking
powder
nowadays
when
everything
is
so
adulterated
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
says
the
Government
ought
to
take
the
matter
up
,
but
she
says
*NL*
we
'll
never
see
the
day
when
a
Tory
Government
will
do
it
.
Marilla
,
what
*NL*
if
that
cake
does
n't
rise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
plenty
without
it
''
was
Marilla
's
unimpassioned
way
of
*NL*
looking
at
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cake
did
rise
,
however
,
and
came
out
of
the
oven
as
light
and
*NL*
feathery
as
golden
foam
.
Anne
,
flushed
with
delight
,
clapped
it
together
*NL*
with
layers
of
ruby
jelly
and
,
in
imagination
,
saw
Mrs.
Allan
eating
it
*NL*
and
possibly
asking
for
another
piece
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
using
the
best
tea
set
,
of
course
,
Marilla
,
''
she
said
.
``
Can
I
*NL*
fix
the
table
with
ferns
and
wild
roses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
's
all
nonsense
,
''
sniffed
Marilla
.
``
In
my
opinion
it
's
the
*NL*
eatables
that
matter
and
not
flummery
decorations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Barry
had
HER
table
decorated
,
''
said
Anne
,
who
was
not
entirely
*NL*
guiltless
of
the
wisdom
of
the
serpent
,
``
and
the
minister
paid
her
an
*NL*
elegant
compliment
.
He
said
it
was
a
feast
for
the
eye
as
well
as
the
*NL*
palate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
as
you
like
,
''
said
Marilla
,
who
was
quite
determined
not
to
*NL*
be
surpassed
by
Mrs.
Barry
or
anybody
else
.
``
Only
mind
you
leave
enough
*NL*
room
for
the
dishes
and
the
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
laid
herself
out
to
decorate
in
a
manner
and
after
a
fashion
that
*NL*
should
leave
Mrs.
Barry
's
nowhere
.
Having
abundance
of
roses
and
ferns
*NL*
and
a
very
artistic
taste
of
her
own
,
she
made
that
tea
table
such
a
*NL*
thing
of
beauty
that
when
the
minister
and
his
wife
sat
down
to
it
they
*NL*
exclaimed
in
chorus
over
it
loveliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Anne
's
doings
,
''
said
Marilla
,
grimly
just
;
and
Anne
felt
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
's
approving
smile
was
almost
too
much
happiness
for
this
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
was
there
,
having
been
inveigled
into
the
party
only
goodness
*NL*
and
Anne
knew
how
.
He
had
been
in
such
a
state
of
shyness
and
*NL*
nervousness
that
Marilla
had
given
him
up
in
despair
,
but
Anne
took
him
*NL*
in
hand
so
successfully
that
he
now
sat
at
the
table
in
his
best
clothes
*NL*
and
white
collar
and
talked
to
the
minister
not
uninterestingly
.
*NL*
He
never
said
a
word
to
Mrs.
Allan
,
but
that
perhaps
was
not
to
be
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
went
merry
as
a
marriage
bell
until
Anne
's
layer
cake
was
passed
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Allan
,
having
already
been
helped
to
a
bewildering
variety
,
*NL*
declined
it
.
But
Marilla
,
seeing
the
disappointment
on
Anne
's
face
,
said
*NL*
smilingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
take
a
piece
of
this
,
Mrs.
Allan
.
Anne
made
it
on
purpose
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
I
must
sample
it
,
''
laughed
Mrs.
Allan
,
helping
herself
to
*NL*
a
plump
triangle
,
as
did
also
the
minister
and
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Allan
took
a
mouthful
of
hers
and
a
most
peculiar
expression
*NL*
crossed
her
face
;
not
a
word
did
she
say
,
however
,
but
steadily
ate
away
*NL*
at
it
.
Marilla
saw
the
expression
and
hastened
to
taste
the
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
what
on
earth
did
you
put
into
that
*NL*
cake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
what
the
recipe
said
,
Marilla
,
''
cried
Anne
with
a
look
of
*NL*
anguish
.
``
Oh
,
is
n't
it
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
It
's
simply
horrible
.
Mr.
Allan
,
do
n't
try
to
eat
it
.
Anne
,
*NL*
taste
it
yourself
.
What
flavoring
did
you
use
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vanilla
,
''
said
Anne
,
her
face
scarlet
with
mortification
after
tasting
*NL*
the
cake
.
``
Only
vanilla
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
must
have
been
the
baking
*NL*
powder
.
I
had
my
suspicions
of
that
bak
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baking
powder
fiddlesticks
!
Go
and
bring
me
the
bottle
of
vanilla
you
*NL*
used
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
fled
to
the
pantry
and
returned
with
a
small
bottle
partially
*NL*
filled
with
a
brown
liquid
and
labeled
yellowly
,
``
Best
Vanilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
took
it
,
uncorked
it
,
smelled
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
,
Anne
,
you
've
flavored
that
cake
with
ANODYNE
LINIMENT
.
I
*NL*
broke
the
liniment
bottle
last
week
and
poured
what
was
left
into
an
*NL*
old
empty
vanilla
bottle
.
I
suppose
it
's
partly
my
fault
--
I
should
have
*NL*
warned
you
--
but
for
pity
's
sake
why
could
n't
you
have
smelled
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
dissolved
into
tears
under
this
double
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
--
I
had
such
a
cold
!
''
and
with
this
she
fairly
fled
to
the
*NL*
gable
chamber
,
where
she
cast
herself
on
the
bed
and
wept
as
one
who
*NL*
refuses
to
be
comforted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
a
light
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
somebody
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
sobbed
Anne
,
without
looking
up
,
``
I
'm
disgraced
forever
.
*NL*
I
shall
never
be
able
to
live
this
down
.
It
will
get
out
--
things
always
*NL*
do
get
out
in
Avonlea
.
Diana
will
ask
me
how
my
cake
turned
out
and
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
tell
her
the
truth
.
I
shall
always
be
pointed
at
as
the
*NL*
girl
who
flavored
a
cake
with
anodyne
liniment
.
Gil
--
the
boys
in
school
*NL*
will
never
get
over
laughing
at
it
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
if
you
have
a
spark
*NL*
of
Christian
pity
do
n't
tell
me
that
I
must
go
down
and
wash
the
dishes
*NL*
after
this
.
I
'll
wash
them
when
the
minister
and
his
wife
are
gone
,
but
*NL*
I
can
not
ever
look
Mrs.
Allan
in
the
face
again
.
Perhaps
she
'll
think
I
*NL*
tried
to
poison
her
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
she
knows
an
orphan
girl
who
tried
*NL*
to
poison
her
benefactor
.
But
the
liniment
is
n't
poisonous
.
It
's
meant
*NL*
to
be
taken
internally
--
although
not
in
cakes
.
Wo
n't
you
tell
Mrs.
Allan
*NL*
so
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
jump
up
and
tell
her
so
yourself
,
''
said
a
merry
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
flew
up
,
to
find
Mrs.
Allan
standing
by
her
bed
,
surveying
her
with
*NL*
laughing
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
little
girl
,
you
must
n't
cry
like
this
,
''
she
said
,
genuinely
*NL*
disturbed
by
Anne
's
tragic
face
.
``
Why
,
it
's
all
just
a
funny
mistake
*NL*
that
anybody
might
make
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
it
takes
me
to
make
such
a
mistake
,
''
said
Anne
forlornly
.
``
And
*NL*
I
wanted
to
have
that
cake
so
nice
for
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

And
I

you
I
appreciate
your

thoughtfulness

as
much
as
if
it
had
turned
out
all
right

Now
,
*NL*
you
must
n't
cry
any
more
,
but
come
down
with
me
and
show
me
your
flower
*NL*
garden
.
Miss
Cuthbert
tells
me
you
have
a
little
plot
all
your
own
.
I
*NL*
want
to
see
it
,
for
I
'm
very
much
interested
in
flowers

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
permitted
herself
to
be
led
down
and
comforted
,
reflecting
that
it
*NL*
was
really
providential
that
Mrs.
Allan
was
a
kindred
spirit
.
Nothing
*NL*
more
was
said
about
the
liniment
cake
,
and
when
the
guests
went
away
*NL*
Anne
found
that
she
had
enjoyed
the
evening
more
than
could
have
been
*NL*
expected
,
considering
that
terrible
incident
.
Nevertheless
,
she
sighed
*NL*
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla

is
n't
it

admitted
Anne
mournfully

twice

``
I

*NL*
``
Oh

you

can
make

and
when
I
get
to
the
end
of
them

then
I
'll
be
through

with

a

comforting
thought

*NL*
``
Well

you
'd
better
go

CHAPTER
XXII
.
Anne
is
Invited
Out
to
Tea
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
your
eyes
popping
out
of
your
head
about
.
Now
?
''
asked
*NL*
Marilla
,
when
Anne
had
just
come
in
from
a
run
to
the
post
office
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
discovered
another
kindred
spirit
?
''
Excitement
hung
around
Anne
like
*NL*
a
garment
,
shone
in
her
eyes
,
kindled
in
every
feature
.
She
had
come
*NL*
dancing
up
the
lane
,
like
a
wind-blown
sprite
,
through
the
mellow
*NL*
sunshine
and
lazy
shadows
of
the
August
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Marilla
,
but
oh
,
what
do
you
think
?
I
am
invited
to
tea
at
the
*NL*
manse
tomorrow
afternoon
!
Mrs.
Allan
left
the
letter
for
me
at
the
post
*NL*
office
.
Just
look
at
it
,
Marilla
.
`
Miss
Anne
Shirley
,
Green
Gables
.
'
*NL*
That
is
the
first
time
I
was
ever
called
`
Miss.
'
Such
a
thrill
as
it
*NL*
gave
me
!
I
shall
cherish
it
forever
among
my
choicest
treasures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Allan
told
me
she
meant
to
have
all
the
members
of
her
*NL*
Sunday-school
class
to
tea
in
turn
,
''
said
Marilla
,
regarding
the
*NL*
wonderful
event
very
coolly
.
``
You
need
n't
get
in
such
a
fever
over
it
.
*NL*
Do
learn
to
take
things
calmly
,
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Anne
to
take
things
calmly
would
have
been
to
change
her
nature
.
All
*NL*
``
spirit
and
fire
and
dew
,
''
as
she
was
,
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
life
*NL*
came
to
her
with
trebled
intensity
.
Marilla
felt
this
and
was
vaguely
*NL*
troubled
over
it
,
realizing
that
the
ups
and
downs
of
existence
would
*NL*
probably
bear
hardly
on
this
impulsive
soul
and
not
sufficiently
*NL*
understanding
that
the
equally
great
capacity
for
delight
might
more
*NL*
than
compensate
.
Therefore
Marilla
conceived
it
to
be
her
duty
to
drill
*NL*
Anne
into
a
tranquil
uniformity
of
disposition
as
impossible
and
alien
*NL*
to
her
as
to
a
dancing
sunbeam
in
one
of
the
brook
shallows
.
She
did
not
*NL*
make
much
headway
,
as
she
sorrowfully
admitted
to
herself
.
The
downfall
*NL*
of
some
dear
hope
or
plan
plunged
Anne
into
``
deeps
of
affliction
.
''
The
*NL*
fulfillment
thereof
exalted
her
to
dizzy
realms
of
delight
.
Marilla
had
*NL*
almost
begun
to
despair
of
ever
fashioning
this
waif
of
the
world
into
*NL*
her
model
little
girl
of
demure
manners
and
prim
deportment
.
Neither
*NL*
would
she
have
believed
that
she
really
liked
Anne
much
better
as
she
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
to
bed
that
night
speechless
with
misery
because
Matthew
had
*NL*
said
the
wind
was
round
northeast
and
he
feared
it
would
be
a
rainy
day
*NL*
tomorrow
.
The
rustle
of
the
poplar
leaves
about
the
house
worried
her
,
*NL*
it
sounded
so
like
pattering
raindrops
,
and
the
full
,
faraway
roar
of
*NL*
the
gulf
,
to
which
she
listened
delightedly
at
other
times
,
loving
its
*NL*
strange
,
sonorous
,
haunting
rhythm
,
now
seemed
like
a
prophecy
of
storm
*NL*
and
disaster
to
a
small
maiden
who
particularly
wanted
a
fine
day
.
Anne
*NL*
thought
that
the
morning
would
never
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
things
have
an
end
,
even
nights
before
the
day
on
which
you
are
*NL*
invited
to
take
tea
at
the
manse
.
The
morning
,
in
spite
of
Matthew
's
*NL*
predictions
,
was
fine
and
Anne
's
spirits
soared
to
their
highest
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
there
is
something
in
me
today
that
makes
me
just
love
*NL*
everybody
I
see
,
''
she
exclaimed
as
she
washed
the
breakfast
dishes
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
how
good
I
feel
!
Would
n't
it
be
nice
if
it
could
last
?
I
*NL*
believe
I
could
be
a
model
child
if
I
were
just
invited
out
to
tea
every
*NL*
day
.
But
oh
,
Marilla
,
it
's
a
solemn
occasion
too
.
I
feel
so
anxious
.
*NL*
What
if
I
should
n't
behave
properly
?
You
know
I
never
had
tea
at
a
*NL*
manse
before
,
and
I
'm
not
sure
that
I
know
all
the
rules
of
etiquette
,
*NL*
although
I
've
been
studying
the
rules
given
in
the
Etiquette
Department
*NL*
of
the
Family
Herald
ever
since
I
came
here
.
I
'm
so
afraid
I
'll
do
*NL*
something
silly
or
forget
to
do
something
I
should
do
.
Would
it
be
*NL*
good
manners
to
take
a
second
helping
of
anything
if
you
wanted
to
VERY
*NL*
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trouble
with
you
,
Anne
,
is
that
you
're
thinking
too
much
about
*NL*
yourself
.
You
should
just
think
of
Mrs.
Allan
and
what
would
be
nicest
*NL*
and
most
agreeable
to
her
,
''
said
Marilla
,
hitting
for
once
in
her
life
*NL*
on
a
very
sound
and
pithy
piece
of
advice
.
Anne
instantly
realized
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Marilla
.
I
'll
try
not
to
think
about
myself
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
evidently
got
through
her
visit
without
any
serious
breach
of
*NL*
``
etiquette
,
''
for
she
came
home
through
the
twilight
,
under
a
great
,
*NL*
high-sprung
sky
gloried
over
with
trails
of
saffron
and
rosy
cloud
,
in
*NL*
a
beatified
state
of
mind
and
told
Marilla
all
about
it
happily
,
sitting
*NL*
on
the
big
red-sandstone
slab
at
the
kitchen
door
with
her
tired
curly
*NL*
head
in
Marilla
's
gingham
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cool
wind
was
blowing
down
over
the
long
harvest
fields
from
the
rims
*NL*
of
firry
western
hills
and
whistling
through
the
poplars
.
One
clear
star
*NL*
hung
over
the
orchard
and
the
fireflies
were
flitting
over
in
Lover
's
*NL*
Lane
,
in
and
out
among
the
ferns
and
rustling
boughs
.
Anne
watched
them
*NL*
as
she
talked
and
somehow
felt
that
wind
and
stars
and
fireflies
were
*NL*
all
tangled
up
together
into
something
unutterably
sweet
and
enchanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
've
had
a
most
FASCINATING
time
.
I
feel
that
I
have
not
*NL*
lived
in
vain
and
I
shall
always
feel
like
that
even
if
I
should
never
*NL*
be
invited
to
tea
at
a
manse
again
.
When
I
got
there
Mrs.
Allan
met
me
*NL*
at
the
door
.
She
was
dressed
in
the
sweetest
dress
of
pale-pink
organdy
,
*NL*
with
dozens
of
frills
and
elbow
sleeves
,
and
she
looked
just
like
a
*NL*
seraph
.
I
really
think
I
'd
like
to
be
a
minister
's
wife
when
I
grow
up
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
A
minister
might
n't
mind
my
red
hair
because
he
would
n't
be
*NL*
thinking
of
such
worldly
things
.
But
then
of
course
one
would
have
to
*NL*
be
naturally
good
and
I
'll
never
be
that
,
so
I
suppose
there
's
no
use
in
*NL*
thinking
about
it
.
Some
people
are
naturally
good
,
you
know
,
and
others
*NL*
are
not
.
I
'm
one
of
the
others
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
I
'm
full
of
original
*NL*
sin
.
No
matter
how
hard
I
try
to
be
good
I
can
never
make
such
a
success
*NL*
of
it
as
those
who
are
naturally
good
.
It
's
a
good
deal
like
geometry
,
*NL*
I
expect
.
But
do
n't
you
think
the
trying
so
hard
ought
to
count
for
*NL*
something
?
Mrs.
Allan
is
one
of
the
naturally
good
people
.
I
love
her
*NL*
passionately
.
You
know
there
are
some
people
,
like
Matthew
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
that
you
can
love
right
off
without
any
trouble
.
And
there
are
*NL*
others
,
like
Mrs.
Lynde
,
that
you
have
to
try
very
hard
to
love
.
You
*NL*
know
you
OUGHT
to
love
them
because
they
know
so
much
and
are
such
*NL*
active
workers
in
the
church
,
but
you
have
to
keep
reminding
yourself
of
*NL*
it
all
the
time
or
else
you
forget
.
There
was
another
little
girl
at
the
*NL*
manse
to
tea
,
from
the
White
Sands
Sunday
school
.
Her
name
was
Laurette
*NL*
Bradley
,
and
she
was
a
very
nice
little
girl
.
Not
exactly
a
kindred
*NL*
spirit
,
you
know
,
but
still
very
nice
.
We
had
an
elegant
tea
,
and
I
*NL*
think
I
kept
all
the
rules
of
etiquette
pretty
well
.
After
tea
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
played
and
sang
and
she
got
Lauretta
and
me
to
sing
too
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Allan
says
I
have
a
good
voice
and
she
says
I
must
sing
in
the
*NL*
Sunday-school
choir
after
this
.
You
ca
n't
think
how
I
was
thrilled
at
*NL*
the
mere
thought
.
I
've
longed
so
to
sing
in
the
Sunday-school
choir
,
*NL*
as
Diana
does
,
but
I
feared
it
was
an
honor
I
could
never
aspire
to
.
*NL*
Lauretta
had
to
go
home
early
because
there
is
a
big
concert
in
the
*NL*
White
Sands
Hotel
tonight
and
her
sister
is
to
recite
at
it
.
Lauretta
*NL*
says
that
the
Americans
at
the
hotel
give
a
concert
every
fortnight
in
*NL*
aid
of
the
Charlottetown
hospital
,
and
they
ask
lots
of
the
White
*NL*
Sands
people
to
recite
.
Lauretta
said
she
expected
to
be
asked
herself
*NL*
someday
.
I
just
gazed
at
her
in
awe
.
After
she
had
gone
Mrs.
Allan
and
I
*NL*
had
a
heart-to-heart
talk
.
I
told
her
everything
--
about
Mrs.
Thomas
and
*NL*
the
twins
and
Katie
Maurice
and
Violetta
and
coming
to
Green
Gables
and
*NL*
my
troubles
over
geometry
.
And
would
you
believe
it
,
Marilla
?
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
told
me
she
was
a
dunce
at
geometry
too
.
You
do
n't
know
how
that
*NL*
encouraged
me
.
Mrs.
Lynde
came
to
the
manse
just
before
I
left
,
and
what
*NL*
do
you
think
,
Marilla
?
The
trustees
have
hired
a
new
teacher
and
it
's
*NL*
a
lady
.
Her
name
is
Miss
Muriel
Stacy
.
Is
n't
that
a
romantic
name
?
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
says
they
've
never
had
a
female
teacher
in
Avonlea
before
and
she
*NL*
thinks
it
is
a
dangerous
innovation
.
But
I
think
it
will
be
splendid
*NL*
to
have
a
lady
teacher
,
and
I
really
do
n't
see
how
I
'm
going
to
live
*NL*
through
the
two
weeks
before
school
begins
.
I
'm
so
impatient
to
see
*NL*
her
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
Anne
Comes
to
Grief
in
an
Affair
of
Honor
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
to
live
through
more
than
two
weeks
,
as
it
happened
.
Almost
a
*NL*
month
having
elapsed
since
the
liniment
cake
episode
,
it
was
high
time
*NL*
for
her
to
get
into
fresh
trouble
of
some
sort
,
little
mistakes
,
such
as
*NL*
absentmindedly
emptying
a
pan
of
skim
milk
into
a
basket
of
yarn
balls
*NL*
in
the
pantry
instead
of
into
the
pigs
'
bucket
,
and
walking
clean
over
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
log
bridge
into
the
brook
while
wrapped
in
imaginative
*NL*
reverie
,
not
really
being
worth
counting
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
after
the
tea
at
the
manse
Diana
Barry
gave
a
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Small
and
select
,
''
Anne
assured
Marilla
.
``
Just
the
girls
in
our
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
very
good
time
and
nothing
untoward
happened
until
after
tea
,
*NL*
when
they
found
themselves
in
the
Barry
garden
,
a
little
tired
of
all
*NL*
their
games
and
ripe
for
any
enticing
form
of
mischief
which
might
*NL*
present
itself
.
This
presently
took
the
form
of
``
daring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daring
was
the
fashionable
amusement
among
the
Avonlea
small
fry
just
*NL*
then
.
It
had
begun
among
the
boys
,
but
soon
spread
to
the
girls
,
and
all
*NL*
the
silly
things
that
were
done
in
Avonlea
that
summer
because
the
doers
*NL*
thereof
were
``
dared
''
to
do
them
would
fill
a
book
by
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
of
all
Carrie
Sloane
dared
Ruby
Gillis
to
climb
to
a
certain
point
*NL*
in
the
huge
old
willow
tree
before
the
front
door
;
which
Ruby
Gillis
,
*NL*
albeit
in
mortal
dread
of
the
fat
green
caterpillars
with
which
said
*NL*
tree
was
infested
and
with
the
fear
of
her
mother
before
her
eyes
if
she
*NL*
should
tear
her
new
muslin
dress
,
nimbly
did
,
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
*NL*
aforesaid
Carrie
Sloane
.
Then
Josie
Pye
dared
Jane
Andrews
to
hop
on
her
*NL*
left
leg
around
the
garden
without
stopping
once
or
putting
her
right
*NL*
foot
to
the
ground
;
which
Jane
Andrews
gamely
tried
to
do
,
but
gave
out
*NL*
at
the
third
corner
and
had
to
confess
herself
defeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Josie
's
triumph
being
rather
more
pronounced
than
good
taste
permitted
,
*NL*
Anne
Shirley
dared
her
to
walk
along
the
top
of
the
board
fence
which
*NL*
bounded
the
garden
to
the
east
.
Now
,
to
``
walk
''
board
fences
requires
*NL*
more
skill
and
steadiness
of
head
and
heel
than
one
might
suppose
who
*NL*
has
never
tried
it
.
But
Josie
Pye
,
if
deficient
in
some
qualities
*NL*
that
make
for
popularity
,
had
at
least
a
natural
and
inborn
gift
,
duly
*NL*
cultivated
,
for
walking
board
fences
.
Josie
walked
the
Barry
fence
with
*NL*
an
airy
unconcern
which
seemed
to
imply
that
a
little
thing
like
that
*NL*
was
n't
worth
a
``
dare
.
''
Reluctant
admiration
greeted
her
exploit
,
for
*NL*
most
of
the
other
girls
could
appreciate
it
,
having
suffered
many
things
*NL*
themselves
in
their
efforts
to
walk
fences
.
Josie
descended
from
her
*NL*
perch
,
flushed
with
victory
,
and
darted
a
defiant
glance
at
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
tossed
her
red
braids
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
such
a
very
wonderful
thing
to
walk
a
little
,
low
,
*NL*
board
fence
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
knew
a
girl
in
Marysville
who
could
walk
the
*NL*
ridgepole
of
a
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
''
said
Josie
flatly
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
anybody
could
*NL*
walk
a
ridgepole
.
YOU
could
n't
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
I
?
''
cried
Anne
rashly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
dare
you
to
do
it
,
''
said
Josie
defiantly
.
``
I
dare
you
to
climb
*NL*
up
there
and
walk
the
ridgepole
of
Mr.
Barry
's
kitchen
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
turned
pale
,
but
there
was
clearly
only
one
thing
to
be
done
.
She
*NL*
walked
toward
the
house
,
where
a
ladder
was
leaning
against
the
kitchen
*NL*
roof
.
All
the
fifth-class
girls
said
,
``
Oh
!
''
partly
in
excitement
,
partly
*NL*
in
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
do
it
,
Anne
,
''
entreated
Diana
.
``
You
'll
fall
off
and
be
*NL*
killed
.
Never
mind
Josie
Pye
.
It
is
n't
fair
to
dare
anybody
to
do
*NL*
anything
so
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
do
it
.
My
honor
is
at
stake
,
''
said
Anne
solemnly
.
``
I
shall
walk
*NL*
that
ridgepole
,
Diana
,
or
perish
in
the
attempt
.
If
I
am
killed
you
are
*NL*
to
have
my
pearl
bead
ring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
climbed
the
ladder
amid
breathless
silence
,
gained
the
ridgepole
,
*NL*
balanced
herself
uprightly
on
that
precarious
footing
,
and
started
to
*NL*
walk
along
it
,
dizzily
conscious
that
she
was
uncomfortably
high
up
*NL*
in
the
world
and
that
walking
ridgepoles
was
not
a
thing
in
which
your
*NL*
imagination
helped
you
out
much
.
Nevertheless
,
she
managed
to
take
*NL*
several
steps
before
the
catastrophe
came
.
Then
she
swayed
,
lost
her
*NL*
balance
,
stumbled
,
staggered
,
and
fell
,
sliding
down
over
the
sun-baked
*NL*
roof
and
crashing
off
it
through
the
tangle
of
Virginia
creeper
*NL*
beneath
--
all
before
the
dismayed
circle
below
could
give
a
simultaneous
,
*NL*
terrified
shriek
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Anne
had
tumbled
off
the
roof
on
the
side
up
which
she
had
ascended
*NL*
Diana
would
probably
have
fallen
heir
to
the
pearl
bead
ring
then
and
*NL*
there
.
Fortunately
she
fell
on
the
other
side
,
where
the
roof
extended
*NL*
down
over
the
porch
so
nearly
to
the
ground
that
a
fall
therefrom
was
*NL*
a
much
less
serious
thing
.
Nevertheless
,
when
Diana
and
the
other
*NL*
girls
had
rushed
frantically
around
the
house
--
except
Ruby
Gillis
,
who
*NL*
remained
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
and
went
into
hysterics
--
they
found
*NL*
Anne
lying
all
white
and
limp
among
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
the
Virginia
*NL*
creeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
are
you
killed
?
''
shrieked
Diana
,
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
*NL*
beside
her
friend
.
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
dear
Anne
,
speak
just
one
word
to
me
and
*NL*
tell
me
if
you
're
killed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
immense
relief
of
all
the
girls
,
and
especially
of
Josie
Pye
,
*NL*
who
,
in
spite
of
lack
of
imagination
,
had
been
seized
with
horrible
*NL*
visions
of
a
future
branded
as
the
girl
who
was
the
cause
of
Anne
*NL*
Shirley
's
early
and
tragic
death
,
Anne
sat
dizzily
up
and
answered
*NL*
uncertainly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Diana
,
I
am
not
killed
,
but
I
think
I
am
rendered
unconscious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
sobbed
Carrie
Sloane
.
``
Oh
,
where
,
Anne
?
''
Before
Anne
could
*NL*
answer
Mrs.
Barry
appeared
on
the
scene
.
At
sight
of
her
Anne
tried
to
*NL*
scramble
to
her
feet
,
but
sank
back
again
with
a
sharp
little
cry
of
*NL*
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
Where
have
you
hurt
yourself
?
''
demanded
Mrs.
Barry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ankle
,
''
gasped
Anne
.
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
please
find
your
father
and
ask
him
*NL*
to
take
me
home
.
I
know
I
can
never
walk
there
.
And
I
'm
sure
I
could
n't
*NL*
hop
so
far
on
one
foot
when
Jane
could
n't
even
hop
around
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
was
out
in
the
orchard
picking
a
panful
of
summer
apples
when
*NL*
she
saw
Mr.
Barry
coming
over
the
log
bridge
and
up
the
slope
,
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Barry
beside
him
and
a
whole
procession
of
little
girls
trailing
after
*NL*
him
.
In
his
arms
he
carried
Anne
,
whose
head
lay
limply
against
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Marilla
had
a
revelation
.
In
the
sudden
stab
of
fear
that
*NL*
pierced
her
very
heart
she
realized
what
Anne
had
come
to
mean
to
her
.
*NL*
She
would
have
admitted
that
she
liked
Anne
--
nay
,
that
she
was
very
fond
*NL*
of
Anne
.
But
now
she
knew
as
she
hurried
wildly
down
the
slope
that
Anne
*NL*
was
dearer
to
her
than
anything
else
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Barry
,
what
has
happened
to
her
?
''
she
gasped
,
more
white
and
shaken
*NL*
than
the
self-contained
,
sensible
Marilla
had
been
for
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
herself
answered
,
lifting
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
very
frightened
,
Marilla
.
I
was
walking
the
ridgepole
and
I
*NL*
fell
off
.
I
expect
I
have
sprained
my
ankle
.
But
,
Marilla
,
I
might
have
*NL*
broken
my
neck
.
Let
us
look
on
the
bright
side
of
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
have
known
you
'd
go
and
do
something
of
the
sort
when
I
let
you
*NL*
go
to
that
party
,
''
said
Marilla
,
sharp
and
shrewish
in
her
very
relief
.
*NL*
``
Bring
her
in
here
,
Mr.
Barry
,
and
lay
her
on
the
sofa
.
Mercy
me
,
the
*NL*
child
has
gone
and
fainted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
true
.
Overcome
by
the
pain
of
her
injury
,
Anne
had
one
more
*NL*
of
her
wishes
granted
to
her
.
She
had
fainted
dead
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
,
hastily
summoned
from
the
harvest
field
,
was
straightway
*NL*
dispatched
for
the
doctor
,
who
in
due
time
came
,
to
discover
that
the
*NL*
injury
was
more
serious
than
they
had
supposed
.
Anne
's
ankle
was
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
when
Marilla
went
up
to
the
east
gable
,
where
a
white-faced
*NL*
girl
was
lying
,
a
plaintive
voice
greeted
her
from
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
very
sorry
for
me
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
your
own
fault
,
''
said
Marilla
,
twitching
down
the
blind
and
*NL*
lighting
a
lamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
just
why
you
should
be
sorry
for
me
,
''
said
Anne
,
``
because
*NL*
the
thought
that
it
is
all
my
own
fault
is
what
makes
it
so
hard
.
If
I
*NL*
could
blame
it
on
anybody
I
would
feel
so
much
better
.
But
what
would
*NL*
you
have
done
,
Marilla
,
if
you
had
been
dared
to
walk
a
ridgepole
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
have
stayed
on
good
firm
ground
and
let
them
dare
away
.
Such
*NL*
absurdity
!
''
said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
such
strength
of
mind
,
Marilla
.
I
have
n't
.
I
just
felt
*NL*
that
I
could
n't
bear
Josie
Pye
's
scorn
.
She
would
have
crowed
over
me
*NL*
all
my
life
.
And
I
think
I
have
been
punished
so
much
that
you
need
n't
*NL*
be
very
cross
with
me
,
Marilla
.
It
's
not
a
bit
nice
to
faint
,
after
all
.
*NL*
And
the
doctor
hurt
me
dreadfully
when
he
was
setting
my
ankle
.
I
wo
n't
*NL*
be
able
to
go
around
for
six
or
seven
weeks
and
I
'll
miss
the
new
lady
*NL*
teacher
.
She
wo
n't
be
new
any
more
by
the
time
I
'm
able
to
go
to
school
.
*NL*
And
Gil
--
everybody
will
get
ahead
of
me
in
class
.
Oh
,
I
am
an
afflicted
*NL*
mortal
.
But
I
'll
try
to
bear
it
all
bravely
if
only
you
wo
n't
be
cross
*NL*
with
me
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
I
'm
not
cross
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
You
're
an
unlucky
child
,
*NL*
there
's
no
doubt
about
that
;
but
as
you
say
,
you
'll
have
the
suffering
*NL*
of
it
.
Here
now
,
try
and
eat
some
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
fortunate
I
've
got
such
an
imagination
?
''
said
Anne
.
``
It
will
*NL*
help
me
through
splendidly
,
I
expect
.
What
do
people
who
have
n't
any
*NL*
imagination
do
when
they
break
their
bones
,
do
you
suppose
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
good
reason
to
bless
her
imagination
many
a
time
and
oft
during
*NL*
the
tedious
seven
weeks
that
followed
.
But
she
was
not
solely
dependent
*NL*
on
it
.
She
had
many
visitors
and
not
a
day
passed
without
one
or
more
of
*NL*
the
schoolgirls
dropping
in
to
bring
her
flowers
and
books
and
tell
her
*NL*
all
the
happenings
in
the
juvenile
world
of
Avonlea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
has
been
so
good
and
kind
,
Marilla
,
''
sighed
Anne
happily
,
*NL*
on
the
day
when
she
could
first
limp
across
the
floor
.
``
It
is
n't
very
*NL*
pleasant
to
be
laid
up
;
but
there
is
a
bright
side
to
it
,
Marilla
.
You
*NL*
find
out
how
many
friends
you
have
.
Why
,
even
Superintendent
Bell
came
*NL*
to
see
me
,
and
he
's
really
a
very
fine
man
.
Not
a
kindred
spirit
,
of
*NL*
course
;
but
still
I
like
him
and
I
'm
awfully
sorry
I
ever
criticized
his
*NL*
prayers
.
I
believe
now
he
really
does
mean
them
,
only
he
has
got
into
*NL*
the
habit
of
saying
them
as
if
he
did
n't
.
He
could
get
over
that
if
he
'd
*NL*
take
a
little
trouble
.
I
gave
him
a
good
broad
hint
.
I
told
him
how
hard
*NL*
I
tried
to
make
my
own
little
private
prayers
interesting
.
He
told
me
*NL*
all
about
the
time
he
broke
his
ankle
when
he
was
a
boy
.
It
does
seem
*NL*
so
strange
to
think
of
Superintendent
Bell
ever
being
a
boy
.
Even
my
*NL*
imagination
has
its
limits
,
for
I
ca
n't
imagine
THAT
.
When
I
try
to
*NL*
imagine
him
as
a
boy
I
see
him
with
gray
whiskers
and
spectacles
,
just
*NL*
as
he
looks
in
Sunday
school
,
only
small
.
Now
,
it
's
so
easy
to
imagine
*NL*
Mrs.
Allan
as
a
little
girl
.
Mrs.
Allan
has
been
to
see
me
fourteen
*NL*
times
.
Is
n't
that
something
to
be
proud
of
,
Marilla
?
When
a
minister
's
*NL*
wife
has
so
many
claims
on
her
time
!
She
is
such
a
cheerful
person
to
*NL*
have
visit
you
,
too
.
She
never
tells
you
it
's
your
own
fault
and
she
*NL*
hopes
you
'll
be
a
better
girl
on
account
of
it
.
Mrs.
Lynde
always
told
*NL*
me
that
when
she
came
to
see
me
;
and
she
said
it
in
a
kind
of
way
that
*NL*
made
me
feel
she
might
hope
I
'd
be
a
better
girl
but
did
n't
really
*NL*
believe
I
would
.
Even
Josie
Pye
came
to
see
me
.
I
received
her
as
*NL*
politely
as
I
could
,
because
I
think
she
was
sorry
she
dared
me
to
walk
*NL*
a
ridgepole
.
If
I
had
been
killed
she
would
had
to
carry
a
dark
burden
*NL*
of
remorse
all
her
life
.
Diana
has
been
a
faithful
friend
.
She
's
been
*NL*
over
every
day
to
cheer
my
lonely
pillow
.
But
oh
,
I
shall
be
so
glad
*NL*
when
I
can
go
to
school
for
I
've
heard
such
exciting
things
about
the
*NL*
new
teacher
.
The
girls
all
think
she
is
perfectly
sweet
.
Diana
says
she
*NL*
has
the
loveliest
fair
curly
hair
and
such
fascinating
eyes
.
She
dresses
*NL*
beautifully
,
and
her
sleeve
puffs
are
bigger
than
anybody
else
's
in
*NL*
Avonlea
.
Every
other
Friday
afternoon
she
has
recitations
and
everybody
*NL*
has
to
say
a
piece
or
take
part
in
a
dialogue
.
Oh
,
it
's
just
glorious
to
*NL*
think
of
it
.
Josie
Pye
says
she
hates
it
but
that
is
just
because
Josie
*NL*
has
so
little
imagination
.
Diana
and
Ruby
Gillis
and
Jane
Andrews
are
*NL*
preparing
a
dialogue
,
called
'
A
Morning
Visit
,
'
for
next
Friday
.
And
the
*NL*
Friday
afternoons
they
do
n't
have
recitations
Miss
Stacy
takes
them
*NL*
all
to
the
woods
for
a
`
field
'
day
and
they
study
ferns
and
flowers
*NL*
and
birds
.
And
they
have
physical
culture
exercises
every
morning
and
*NL*
evening
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
she
never
heard
of
such
goings
on
and
it
all
*NL*
comes
of
having
a
lady
teacher
.
But
I
think
it
must
be
splendid
and
I
*NL*
believe
I
shall
find
that
Miss
Stacy
is
a
kindred
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
thing
plain
to
be
seen
,
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
,
``
and
that
is
*NL*
that
your
fall
off
the
Barry
roof
has
n't
injured
your
tongue
at
all

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
Miss
Stacy
and
Her
Pupils
Get
Up
a
Concert
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
October
again
when
Anne
was
ready
to
go
back
to
school
--
a
*NL*
glorious
October
,
all
red
and
gold
,
with
mellow
mornings
when
the
*NL*
valleys
were
filled
with
delicate
mists
as
if
the
spirit
of
autumn
had
*NL*
poured
them
in
for
the
sun
to
drain
--
amethyst
,
pearl
,
silver
,
rose
,
and
*NL*
smoke-blue
.
The
dews
were
so
heavy
that
the
fields
glistened
like
cloth
*NL*
of
silver
and
there
were
such
heaps
of
rustling
leaves
in
the
hollows
of
*NL*
many-stemmed
woods
to
run
crisply
through
.
The
Birch
Path
was
a
canopy
*NL*
of
yellow
and
the
ferns
were
sear
and
brown
all
along
it
.
There
was
a
*NL*
tang
in
the
very
air
that
inspired
the
hearts
of
small
maidens
tripping
,
*NL*
unlike
snails
,
swiftly
and
willingly
to
school
;
and
it
WAS
jolly
to
*NL*
be
back
again
at
the
little
brown
desk
beside
Diana
,
with
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
nodding
across
the
aisle
and
Carrie
Sloane
sending
up
notes
and
Julia
*NL*
Bell
passing
a
``
chew
''
of
gum
down
from
the
back
seat
.
Anne
drew
a
long
*NL*
breath
of
happiness
as
she
sharpened
her
pencil
and
arranged
her
picture
*NL*
cards
in
her
desk
.
Life
was
certainly
very
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
new
teacher
she
found
another
true
and
helpful
friend
.
Miss
Stacy
*NL*
was
a
bright
,
sympathetic
young
woman
with
the
happy
gift
of
winning
and
*NL*
holding
the
affections
of
her
pupils
and
bringing
out
the
best
that
was
*NL*
in
them
mentally
and
morally
.
Anne
expanded
like
a
flower
under
this
*NL*
wholesome
influence
and
carried
home
to
the
admiring
Matthew
and
the
*NL*
critical
Marilla
glowing
accounts
of
schoolwork
and
aims
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
Miss
Stacy
with
my
whole
heart
,
Marilla
.
She
is
so
ladylike
*NL*
and
she
has
such
a
sweet
voice
.
When
she
pronounces
my
name
I
feel
*NL*
INSTINCTIVELY
that
she
's
spelling
it
with
an
E
.
We
had
recitations
*NL*
this
afternoon
.
I
just
wish
you
could
have
been
there
to
hear
me
recite
*NL*
`
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
.
'
I
just
put
my
whole
soul
into
it
.
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
told
me
coming
home
that
the
way
I
said
the
line
,
`
Now
for
my
father
's
*NL*
arm
,
'
she
said
,
`
my
woman
's
heart
farewell
,
'
just
made
her
blood
run
*NL*
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
you
might
recite
it
for
me
some
of
these
days
,
out
in
the
*NL*
barn
,
''
suggested
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
will
,
''
said
Anne
meditatively
,
``
but
I
wo
n't
be
able
to
do
*NL*
it
so
well
,
I
know
.
It
wo
n't
be
so
exciting
as
it
is
when
you
have
a
*NL*
whole
schoolful
before
you
hanging
breathlessly
on
your
words
.
I
know
I
*NL*
wo
n't
be
able
to
make
your
blood
run
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Lynde
says
it
made
HER
blood
run
cold
to
see
the
boys
climbing
to
*NL*
the
very
tops
of
those
big
trees
on
Bell
's
hill
after
crows

said
Marilla
.
``
I
wonder
at
Miss
Stacy
for
encouraging
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
wanted
a
crow
's
nest
for
nature
study
,
''
explained
Anne
.
``
That
*NL*
was
on
our
field
afternoon
.
Field
afternoons
are
splendid
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
And
Miss
Stacy
explains
everything
so
beautifully
.
We
have
to
write
*NL*
compositions
on
our
field
afternoons
and
I
write
the
best
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
vain
of
you
to
say
so
then
.
You
'd
better
let
your
teacher
say
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
DID
say
it
,
Marilla
.
And
indeed
I
'm
not
vain
about
it
.
How
can
*NL*
I
be
,
when
I
'm
such
a
dunce
at
geometry
?
Although
I
'm
really
beginning
*NL*
to
see
through
it
a
little
,
too
.
Miss
Stacy
makes
it
so
clear
.
Still
,
*NL*
I
'll
never
be
good
at
it
and
I
assure
you
it
is
a
humbling
reflection
.
*NL*
But
I
love
writing
compositions
.
Mostly
Miss
Stacy
lets
us
choose
*NL*
our
own
subjects
;
but
next
week
we
are
to
write
a
composition
on
some
*NL*
remarkable
person
.
It
's
hard
to
choose
among
so
many
remarkable
people
*NL*
who
have
lived
.
Must
n't
it
be
splendid
to
be
remarkable
and
have
*NL*
compositions
written
about
you
after
you
're
dead
?
Oh
,
I
would
dearly
*NL*
love
to
be
remarkable
.
I
think
when
I
grow
up
I
'll
be
a
trained
nurse
*NL*
and
go
with
the
Red
Crosses
to
the
field
of
battle
as
a
messenger
of
*NL*
mercy
.
That
is
,
if
I
do
n't
go
out
as
a
foreign
missionary
.
That
would
*NL*
be
very
romantic
,
but
one
would
have
to
be
very
good
to
be
a
missionary
,
*NL*
and
that
would
be
a
stumbling
block
.
We
have
physical
culture
exercises
*NL*
every
day
,
too
.
They
make
you
graceful
and
promote
digestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promote
fiddlesticks
!
''
said
Marilla
,
who
honestly
thought
it
was
all
*NL*
nonsense
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
the
field
afternoons
and
recitation
Fridays
and
physical
culture
*NL*
contortions
paled
before
a
project
which
Miss
Stacy
brought
forward
in
*NL*
November
.
This
was
that
the
scholars
of
Avonlea
school
should
get
up
*NL*
a
concert
and
hold
it
in
the
hall
on
Christmas
Night
,
for
the
laudable
*NL*
purpose
of
helping
to
pay
for
a
schoolhouse
flag
.
The
pupils
one
and
*NL*
all
taking
graciously
to
this
plan
,
the
preparations
for
a
program
*NL*
were
begun
at
once
.
And
of
all
the
excited
performers-elect
none
was
so
*NL*
excited
as
Anne
Shirley
,
who
threw
herself
into
the
undertaking
heart
*NL*
and
soul
,
hampered
as
she
was
by
Marilla
's
disapproval
.
Marilla
thought
*NL*
it
all
rank
foolishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
filling
your
heads
up
with
nonsense
and
taking
time
that
*NL*
ought
to
be
put
on
your
lessons
,
''
she
grumbled
.
``
I
do
n't
approve
of
*NL*
children
's
getting
up
concerts
and
racing
about
to
practices
.
It
makes
*NL*
them
vain
and
forward
and
fond
of
gadding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
think
of
the
worthy
object
,
''
pleaded
Anne
.
``
A
flag
will
cultivate
a
*NL*
spirit
of
patriotism
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fudge
!
There
's
precious
little
patriotism
in
the
thoughts
of
any
of
*NL*
you
.
All
you
want
is
a
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
you
can
combine
patriotism
and
fun
,
is
n't
it
all
right
?
Of
*NL*
course
it
's
real
nice
to
be
getting
up
a
concert
.
We
're
going
to
have
*NL*
six
choruses
and
Diana
is
to
sing
a
solo
.
I
'm
in
two
dialogues
--
`
The
*NL*
Society
for
the
Suppression
of
Gossip
'
and
`
The
Fairy
Queen
.
'
The
boys
*NL*
are
going
to
have
a
dialogue
too
.
And
I
'm
to
have
two
recitations
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
I
just
tremble
when
I
think
of
it
,
but
it
's
a
nice
thrilly
kind
*NL*
of
tremble
.
And
we
're
to
have
a
tableau
at
the
last
--
`
Faith
,
Hope
and
*NL*
Charity
.
'
Diana
and
Ruby
and
I
are
to
be
in
it
,
all
draped
in
white
with
*NL*
flowing
hair
.
I
'm
to
be
Hope
,
with
my
hands
clasped
--
so
--
and
my
eyes
*NL*
uplifted
.
I
'm
going
to
practice
my
recitations
in
the
garret
.
Do
n't
be
*NL*
alarmed
if
you
hear
me
groaning
.
I
have
to
groan
heartrendingly
in
one
*NL*
of
them
,
and
it
's
really
hard
to
get
up
a
good
artistic
groan
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
Josie
Pye
is
sulky
because
she
did
n't
get
the
part
she
wanted
in
*NL*
the
dialogue
.
She
wanted
to
be
the
fairy
queen
.
That
would
have
been
*NL*
ridiculous
,
for
who
ever
heard
of
a
fairy
queen
as
fat
as
Josie
?
Fairy
*NL*
queens
must
be
slender
.
Jane
Andrews
is
to
be
the
queen
and
I
am
to
be
*NL*
one
of
her
maids
of
honor
.
Josie
says
she
thinks
a
red-haired
fairy
is
*NL*
just
as
ridiculous
as
a
fat
one
,
but
I
do
not
let
myself
mind
what
Josie
*NL*
says
.
I
'm
to
have
a
wreath
of
white
roses
on
my
hair
and
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
is
going
to
lend
me
her
slippers
because
I
have
n't
any
of
my
own
.
It
's
*NL*
necessary
for
fairies
to
have
slippers
,
you
know
.
You
could
n't
imagine
*NL*
a
fairy
wearing
boots
,
could
you
?
Especially
with
copper
toes
?
We
are
*NL*
going
to
decorate
the
hall
with
creeping
spruce
and
fir
mottoes
with
*NL*
pink
tissue-paper
roses
in
them
.
And
we
are
all
to
march
in
two
by
two
*NL*
after
the
audience
is
seated
,
while
Emma
White
plays
a
march
on
the
*NL*
organ
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
I
know
you
are
not
so
enthusiastic
about
it
as
I
am
,
*NL*
but
do
n't
you
hope
your
little
Anne
will
distinguish
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
I
hope
is
that
you
'll
behave
yourself

I
'll
be
heartily
glad
when
*NL*
all
this
fuss
is
over
and
you
'll
be
able
to
settle
down
.
You
are
simply
*NL*
good
for
nothing
just
now
with
your
head
stuffed
full
of
dialogues
and
*NL*
groans
and
tableaus

As
for
your
tongue
,
it
's
a
marvel
it
's
not
clean
*NL*
worn
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
and
betook
herself
to
the
back
yard
,
over
which
a
young
new
*NL*
moon
was
shining
through
the
leafless
poplar
boughs
from
an
apple-green
*NL*
western
sky
,
and
where
Matthew
was
splitting
wood
.
Anne
perched
herself
*NL*
on
a
block
and
talked
the
concert
over
with
him
,
sure
of
an
appreciative
*NL*
and
sympathetic
listener
in
this
instance
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
reckon
it
's
going
to
be
a
pretty
good
concert
.
And
I
*NL*
expect
you
'll
do
your
part
fine
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
down
into
her
eager
,
*NL*
vivacious
little
face
.
Anne
smiled
back
at
him
.
Those
two
were
the
best
*NL*
of
friends
and
Matthew
thanked
his
stars
many
a
time
and
oft
that
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
bringing
her
up
.
That
was
Marilla
's
exclusive
duty
;
*NL*
if
it
had
been
his
he
would
have
been
worried
over
frequent
conflicts
*NL*
between
inclination
and
said
duty
.
As
it
was
,
he
was
free
to
,
``
spoil
*NL*
Anne
''
--
Marilla
's
phrasing
--
as
much
as
he
liked
.
But
it
was
not
such
a
*NL*
bad
arrangement
after
all
;
a
little
``
appreciation
''
sometimes
does
quite
*NL*
as
much
good
as
all
the
conscientious
``
bringing
up
''
in
the
world

CHAPTER
XXV
.
Matthew
Insists
on
Puffed
Sleeves
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
was
having
a
bad
ten
minutes
of
it
.
He
had
come
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
in
the
twilight
of
a
cold
,
gray
December
evening
,
and
had
sat
*NL*
down
in
the
woodbox
corner
to
take
off
his
heavy
boots
,
unconscious
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
Anne
and
a
bevy
of
her
schoolmates
were
having
a
practice
*NL*
of
``
The
Fairy
Queen
''
in
the
sitting
room
.
Presently
they
came
trooping
*NL*
through
the
hall
and
out
into
the
kitchen
,
laughing
and
chattering
*NL*
gaily
.
They
did
not
see
Matthew
,
who
shrank
bashfully
back
into
the
*NL*
shadows
beyond
the
woodbox
with
a
boot
in
one
hand
and
a
bootjack
in
the
*NL*
other
,
and
he
watched
them
shyly
for
the
aforesaid
ten
minutes
as
they
*NL*
put
on
caps
and
jackets
and
talked
about
the
dialogue
and
the
concert
.
*NL*
Anne
stood
among
them
,
bright
eyed
and
animated
as
they
;
but
Matthew
*NL*
suddenly
became
conscious
that
there
was
something
about
her
different
*NL*
from
her
mates
.
And
what
worried
Matthew
was
that
the
difference
*NL*
impressed
him
as
being
something
that
should
not
exist
.
Anne
had
a
*NL*
brighter
face
,
and
bigger
,
starrier
eyes
,
and
more
delicate
features
*NL*
than
the
other
;
even
shy
,
unobservant
Matthew
had
learned
to
take
note
*NL*
of
these
things
;
but
the
difference
that
disturbed
him
did
not
consist
*NL*
in
any
of
these
respects
.
Then
in
what
did
it
consist
?
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
was
haunted
by
this
question
long
after
the
girls
had
gone
,
arm
*NL*
in
arm
,
down
the
long
,
hard-frozen
lane
and
Anne
had
betaken
herself
*NL*
to
her
books
.
He
could
not
refer
it
to
Marilla
,
who
,
he
felt
,
would
be
*NL*
quite
sure
to
sniff
scornfully
and
remark
that
the
only
difference
she
*NL*
saw
between
Anne
and
the
other
girls
was
that
they
sometimes
kept
their
*NL*
tongues
quiet
while
Anne
never
did
.
This
,
Matthew
felt
,
would
be
no
*NL*
great
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
recourse
to
his
pipe
that
evening
to
help
him
study
it
out
,
much
*NL*
to
Marilla
's
disgust
.
After
two
hours
of
smoking
and
hard
reflection
*NL*
Matthew
arrived
at
a
solution
of
his
problem
.
Anne
was
not
dressed
like
*NL*
the
other
girls
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
Matthew
thought
about
the
matter
the
more
he
was
convinced
that
*NL*
Anne
never
had
been
dressed
like
the
other
girls
--
never
since
she
had
*NL*
come
to
Green
Gables
.
Marilla
kept
her
clothed
in
plain
,
dark
dresses
,
*NL*
all
made
after
the
same
unvarying
pattern
.
If
Matthew
knew
there
was
*NL*
such
a
thing
as
fashion
in
dress
it
was
as
much
as
he
did
;
but
he
was
*NL*
quite
sure
that
Anne
's
sleeves
did
not
look
at
all
like
the
sleeves
the
*NL*
other
girls
wore
.
He
recalled
the
cluster
of
little
girls
he
had
seen
*NL*
around
her
that
evening
--
all
gay
in
waists
of
red
and
blue
and
pink
*NL*
and
white
--
and
he
wondered
why
Marilla
always
kept
her
so
plainly
and
*NL*
soberly
gowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
must
be
all
right
.
Marilla
knew
best
and
Marilla
was
*NL*
bringing
her
up
.
Probably
some
wise
,
inscrutable
motive
was
to
be
served
*NL*
thereby
.
But
surely
it
would
do
no
harm
to
let
the
child
have
one
pretty
*NL*
dress
--
something
like
Diana
Barry
always
wore
.
Matthew
decided
that
*NL*
he
would
give
her
one
;
that
surely
could
not
be
objected
to
as
an
*NL*
unwarranted
putting
in
of
his
oar
.
Christmas
was
only
a
fortnight
off
.
*NL*
A
nice
new
dress
would
be
the
very
thing
for
a
present
.
Matthew
,
with
a
*NL*
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
put
away
his
pipe
and
went
to
bed
,
while
Marilla
*NL*
opened
all
the
doors
and
aired
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
evening
Matthew
betook
himself
to
Carmody
to
buy
the
*NL*
dress
,
determined
to
get
the
worst
over
and
have
done
with
it
.
It
would
*NL*
be
,
he
felt
assured
,
no
trifling
ordeal
.
There
were
some
things
Matthew
*NL*
could
buy
and
prove
himself
no
mean
bargainer
;
but
he
knew
he
would
be
*NL*
at
the
mercy
of
shopkeepers
when
it
came
to
buying
a
girl
's
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
much
cogitation
Matthew
resolved
to
go
to
Samuel
Lawson
's
store
*NL*
instead
of
William
Blair
's
.
To
be
sure
,
the
Cuthberts
always
had
gone
to
*NL*
William
Blair
's
;
it
was
almost
as
much
a
matter
of
conscience
with
them
*NL*
as
to
attend
the
Presbyterian
church
and
vote
Conservative
.
But
William
*NL*
Blair
's
two
daughters
frequently
waited
on
customers
there
and
Matthew
*NL*
held
them
in
absolute
dread
.
He
could
contrive
to
deal
with
them
when
he
*NL*
knew
exactly
what
he
wanted
and
could
point
it
out
;
but
in
such
a
matter
*NL*
as
this
,
requiring
explanation
and
consultation
,
Matthew
felt
that
he
*NL*
must
be
sure
of
a
man
behind
the
counter
.
So
he
would
go
to
Lawson
's
,
*NL*
where
Samuel
or
his
son
would
wait
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
Matthew
did
not
know
that
Samuel
,
in
the
recent
expansion
of
his
*NL*
business
,
had
set
up
a
lady
clerk
also
;
she
was
a
niece
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
and
a
very
dashing
young
person
indeed
,
with
a
huge
,
drooping
pompadour
,
*NL*
big
,
rolling
brown
eyes
,
and
a
most
extensive
and
bewildering
smile
.
She
*NL*
was
dressed
with
exceeding
smartness
and
wore
several
bangle
bracelets
*NL*
that
glittered
and
rattled
and
tinkled
with
every
movement
of
her
hands
.
*NL*
Matthew
was
covered
with
confusion
at
finding
her
there
at
all
;
and
*NL*
those
bangles
completely
wrecked
his
wits
at
one
fell
swoop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
this
evening
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
?
''
Miss
Lucilla
Harris
*NL*
inquired
,
briskly
and
ingratiatingly
,
tapping
the
counter
with
both
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
--
any
--
any
--
well
now
,
say
any
garden
rakes
?
''
stammered
*NL*
Matthew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Harris
looked
somewhat
surprised
,
as
well
she
might
,
to
hear
a
man
*NL*
inquiring
for
garden
rakes
in
the
middle
of
December

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
we
have
one
or
two
left
over
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
they
're
*NL*
upstairs
in
the
lumber
room
.
I
'll
go
and
see
.
''
During
her
absence
*NL*
Matthew
collected
his
scattered
senses
for
another
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Miss
Harris
returned
with
the
rake
and
cheerfully
inquired
:
*NL*
``
Anything
else
tonight
,
Mr.
Cuthbert
?
''
Matthew
took
his
courage
in
*NL*
both
hands
and
replied
:
``
Well
now
,
since
you
suggest
it
,
I
might
as
*NL*
well
--
take
--
that
is
--
look
at
--
buy
some
--
some
hayseed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Harris
had
heard
Matthew
Cuthbert
called
odd
.
She
now
concluded
*NL*
that
he
was
entirely
crazy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
only
keep
hayseed
in
the
spring
,
''
she
explained
loftily
.
``
We
've
none
*NL*
on
hand
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
certainly
--
certainly
--
just
as
you
say
,
''
stammered
unhappy
*NL*
Matthew
,
seizing
the
rake
and
making
for
the
door
.
At
the
threshold
he
*NL*
recollected
that
he
had
not
paid
for
it
and
he
turned
miserably
back
.
*NL*
While
Miss
Harris
was
counting
out
his
change
he
rallied
his
powers
for
*NL*
a
final
desperate
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
--
if
it
is
n't
too
much
trouble
--
I
might
as
well
--
that
is
--
I
'd
*NL*
like
to
look
at
--
at
--
some
sugar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
White
or
brown
?
''
queried
Miss
Harris
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
well
now
--
brown
,
''
said
Matthew
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
barrel
of
it
over
there
,
''
said
Miss
Harris
,
shaking
her
*NL*
bangles
at
it
.
``
It
's
the
only
kind
we
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
--
I
'll
take
twenty
pounds
of
it
,
''
said
Matthew
,
with
beads
of
*NL*
perspiration
standing
on
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
had
driven
halfway
home
before
he
was
his
own
man
again
.
It
had
*NL*
been
a
gruesome
experience
,
but
it
served
him
right
,
he
thought
,
for
*NL*
committing
the
heresy
of
going
to
a
strange
store
.
When
he
reached
*NL*
home
he
hid
the
rake
in
the
tool
house
,
but
the
sugar
he
carried
in
to
*NL*
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brown
sugar
!
''
exclaimed
Marilla
.
``
Whatever
possessed
you
to
get
so
*NL*
much
?
You
know
I
never
use
it
except
for
the
hired
man
's
porridge
or
*NL*
black
fruit
cake
.
Jerry
's
gone
and
I
've
made
my
cake
long
ago
.
It
's
not
*NL*
good
sugar
,
either
--
it
's
coarse
and
dark
--
William
Blair
does
n't
usually
*NL*
keep
sugar
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
thought
it
might
come
in
handy
sometime
,
''
said
Matthew
,
making
*NL*
good
his
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Matthew
came
to
think
the
matter
over
he
decided
that
a
woman
was
*NL*
required
to
cope
with
the
situation
.
Marilla
was
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
Matthew
felt
sure
she
would
throw
cold
water
on
his
project
at
once
.
*NL*
Remained
only
Mrs.
Lynde
;
for
of
no
other
woman
in
Avonlea
would
Matthew
*NL*
have
dared
to
ask
advice
.
To
Mrs.
Lynde
he
went
accordingly
,
and
that
*NL*
good
lady
promptly
took
the
matter
out
of
the
harassed
man
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pick
out
a
dress
for
you
to
give
Anne
?
To
be
sure
I
will
.
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
Carmody
tomorrow
and
I
'll
attend
to
it
.
Have
you
something
particular
in
*NL*
mind
?
No
?
Well
,
I
'll
just
go
by
my
own
judgment
then
.
I
believe
a
nice
*NL*
rich
brown
would
just
suit
Anne
,
and
William
Blair
has
some
new
gloria
*NL*
in
that
's
real
pretty
.
Perhaps
you
'd
like
me
to
make
it
up
for
her
,
too
,
*NL*
seeing
that
if
Marilla
was
to
make
it
Anne
would
probably
get
wind
of
it
*NL*
before
the
time
and
spoil
the
surprise
?
Well
,
I
'll
do
it
.
No
,
it
is
n't
*NL*
a
mite
of
trouble
.
I
like
sewing
.
I
'll
make
it
to
fit
my
niece
,
Jenny
*NL*
Gillis
,
for
she
and
Anne
are
as
like
as
two
peas
as
far
as
figure
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
'm
much
obliged
,
''
said
Matthew
,
``
and
--
and
--
I
dunno
--
but
I
'd
*NL*
like
--
I
think
they
make
the
sleeves
different
nowadays
to
what
they
used
*NL*
to
be
.
If
it
would
n't
be
asking
too
much
I
--
I
'd
like
them
made
in
the
*NL*
new
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Puffs
?
Of
course
.
You
need
n't
worry
a
speck
more
about
it
,
Matthew
.
*NL*
I
'll
make
it
up
in
the
very
latest
fashion
,
''
said
Mrs.
Lynde
.
To
herself
*NL*
she
added
when
Matthew
had
gone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
a
real
satisfaction
to
see
that
poor
child
wearing
something
*NL*
decent
for
once
.
The
way
Marilla
dresses
her
is
positively
ridiculous
,
*NL*
that
's
what
,
and
I
've
ached
to
tell
her
so
plainly
a
dozen
times
.
I
've
*NL*
held
my
tongue
though
,
for
I
can
see
Marilla
does
n't
want
advice
and
she
*NL*
thinks
she
knows
more
about
bringing
children
up
than
I
do
for
all
*NL*
she
's
an
old
maid
.
But
that
's
always
the
way
.
Folks
that
has
brought
up
*NL*
children
know
that
there
's
no
hard
and
fast
method
in
the
world
that
'll
*NL*
suit
every
child
.
But
them
as
never
have
think
it
's
all
as
plain
and
*NL*
easy
as
Rule
of
Three
--
just
set
your
three
terms
down
so
fashion
,
and
*NL*
the
sum
'll
work
out
correct
.
But
flesh
and
blood
do
n't
come
under
the
*NL*
head
of
arithmetic
and
that
's
where
Marilla
Cuthbert
makes
her
mistake
.
*NL*
I
suppose
she
's
trying
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
humility
in
Anne
by
*NL*
dressing
her
as
she
does
;
but
it
's
more
likely
to
cultivate
envy
and
*NL*
discontent
.
I
'm
sure
the
child
must
feel
the
difference
between
her
*NL*
clothes
and
the
other
girls
'
.
But
to
think
of
Matthew
taking
notice
of
*NL*
it
!
That
man
is
waking
up
after
being
asleep
for
over
sixty
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
knew
all
the
following
fortnight
that
Matthew
had
something
on
*NL*
his
mind
,
but
what
it
was
she
could
not
guess
,
until
Christmas
Eve
,
when
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
brought
up
the
new
dress
.
Marilla
behaved
pretty
well
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
although
it
is
very
likely
she
distrusted
Mrs.
Lynde
's
diplomatic
*NL*
explanation
that
she
had
made
the
dress
because
Matthew
was
afraid
Anne
*NL*
would
find
out
about
it
too
soon
if
Marilla
made
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
this
is
what
Matthew
has
been
looking
so
mysterious
over
and
*NL*
grinning
about
to
himself
for
two
weeks
,
is
it
?
''
she
said
a
little
*NL*
stiffly
but
tolerantly
.
``
I
knew
he
was
up
to
some
foolishness
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
must
say
I
do
n't
think
Anne
needed
any
more
dresses
.
I
made
her
three
*NL*
good
,
warm
,
serviceable
ones
this
fall
,
and
anything
more
is
sheer
*NL*
extravagance
.
There
's
enough
material
in
those
sleeves
alone
to
make
a
*NL*
waist
,
I
declare
there
is
.
You
'll
just
pamper
Anne
's
vanity
,
Matthew
,
*NL*
and
she
's
as
vain
as
a
peacock
now
.
Well
,
I
hope
she
'll
be
satisfied
*NL*
at
last
,
for
I
know
she
's
been
hankering
after
those
silly
sleeves
ever
*NL*
since
they
came
in
,
although
she
never
said
a
word
after
the
first
.
The
*NL*
puffs
have
been
getting
bigger
and
more
ridiculous
right
along
;
they
're
*NL*
as
big
as
balloons
now
.
Next
year
anybody
who
wears
them
will
have
to
go
*NL*
through
a
door
sideways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
morning
broke
on
a
beautiful
white
world
.
It
had
been
a
very
*NL*
mild
December
and
people
had
looked
forward
to
a
green
Christmas
;
but
*NL*
just
enough
snow
fell
softly
in
the
night
to
transfigure
Avonlea
.
Anne
*NL*
peeped
out
from
her
frosted
gable
window
with
delighted
eyes
.
The
firs
*NL*
in
the
Haunted
Wood
were
all
feathery
and
wonderful
;
the
birches
*NL*
and
wild
cherry
trees
were
outlined
in
pearl
;
the
plowed
fields
were
*NL*
stretches
of
snowy
dimples
;
and
there
was
a
crisp
tang
in
the
air
that
*NL*
was
glorious
.
Anne
ran
downstairs
singing
until
her
voice
reechoed
*NL*
through
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas
,
Marilla
!
Merry
Christmas
,
Matthew
!
Is
n't
it
a
lovely
*NL*
Christmas
?
I
'm
so
glad
it
's
white
.
Any
other
kind
of
Christmas
does
n't
*NL*
seem
real
,
does
it
?
I
do
n't
like
green
Christmases
.
They
're
not
*NL*
green
--
they
're
just
nasty
faded
browns
and
grays
.
What
makes
people
call
*NL*
them
green
?
Why
--
why
--
Matthew
,
is
that
for
me
?
Oh
,
Matthew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
had
sheepishly
unfolded
the
dress
from
its
paper
swathings
and
*NL*
held
it
out
with
a
deprecatory
glance
at
Marilla
,
who
feigned
to
be
*NL*
contemptuously
filling
the
teapot
,
but
nevertheless
watched
the
scene
*NL*
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
with
a
rather
interested
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
took
the
dress
and
looked
at
it
in
reverent
silence
.
Oh
,
how
pretty
*NL*
it
was
--
a
lovely
soft
brown
gloria
with
all
the
gloss
of
silk
;
a
skirt
*NL*
with
dainty
frills
and
shirrings
;
a
waist
elaborately
pintucked
in
the
*NL*
most
fashionable
way
,
with
a
little
ruffle
of
filmy
lace
at
the
neck
.
*NL*
But
the
sleeves
--
they
were
the
crowning
glory
!
Long
elbow
cuffs
,
and
*NL*
above
them
two
beautiful
puffs
divided
by
rows
of
shirring
and
bows
of
*NL*
brown-silk
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
Christmas
present
for
you
,
Anne
,
''
said
Matthew
shyly
.
*NL*
``
Why
--
why
--
Anne
,
do
n't
you
like
it
?
Well
now
--
well
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Anne
's
eyes
had
suddenly
filled
with
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
it
!
Oh
,
Matthew
!
''
Anne
laid
the
dress
over
a
chair
and
clasped
*NL*
her
hands
.
``
Matthew
,
it
's
perfectly
exquisite
.
Oh
,
I
can
never
thank
you
*NL*
enough
.
Look
at
those
sleeves
!
Oh
,
it
seems
to
me
this
must
be
a
happy
*NL*
dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
let
us
have
breakfast
,
''
interrupted
Marilla
.
``
I
must
say
,
*NL*
Anne
,
I
do
n't
think
you
needed
the
dress
;
but
since
Matthew
has
got
it
*NL*
for
you
,
see
that
you
take
good
care
of
it
.
There
's
a
hair
ribbon
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
left
for
you
.
It
's
brown
,
to
match
the
dress
.
Come
now
,
sit
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
how
I
'm
going
to
eat
breakfast
,
''
said
Anne
rapturously
.
*NL*
``
Breakfast
seems
so
commonplace
at
such
an
exciting
moment
.
I
'd
rather
*NL*
feast
my
eyes
on
that
dress
.
I
'm
so
glad
that
puffed
sleeves
are
still
*NL*
fashionable
.
It
did
seem
to
me
that
I
'd
never
get
over
it
if
they
went
*NL*
out
before
I
had
a
dress
with
them
.
I
'd
never
have
felt
quite
satisfied
,
*NL*
you
see
.
It
was
lovely
of
Mrs.
Lynde
to
give
me
the
ribbon
too
.
I
feel
*NL*
that
I
ought
to
be
a
very
good
girl
indeed
.
It
's
at
times
like
this
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
I
'm
not
a
model
little
girl
;
and
I
always
resolve
that
I
will
*NL*
be
in
future
.
But
somehow
it
's
hard
to
carry
out
your
resolutions
when
*NL*
irresistible
temptations
come
.
Still
,
I
really
will
make
an
extra
effort
*NL*
after
this

When
the
commonplace
breakfast
was
over
Diana
appeared
,
crossing
the
*NL*
white
log
bridge
in
the
hollow
,
a
gay
little
figure
in
her
crimson
*NL*
ulster

Anne
flew
down
the
slope
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas

And
oh

it
's
a
wonderful
Christmas

I

something
splendid
to
show
you

Matthew
has
given

the
loveliest

even
imagine
any
nicer

Diana
breathlessly

``
Here

this

sent
us
out
a
big
box

ever
so
many

it

and
this
is
for
you

I
'd
have
brought
it
over
last
night

but
it
*NL*
did
n't
come
until
after
dark

I
never
feel
very
comfortable
coming

through
the
Haunted
Wood
in

dark
now

*NL*
*NL*
Anne
opened
the
box
and
peeped
in

First
a
card
with
``
For
the
Anne-girl
*NL*

Merry
Christmas

written
on
it

then

a
pair
of

little

with
beaded

glistening

All
the
Avonlea
scholars
were
in
a
fever
of
excitement
that
day
,
for
the
*NL*
hall
had
to
be
decorated
and
a
last
grand
rehearsal
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
concert
came
off
in
the
evening
and
was
a
pronounced
success
.
The
*NL*
little
hall
was
crowded
;
all
the
performers
did
excellently
well
,
but
*NL*
Anne
was
the
bright
particular
star
of
the
occasion
,
as
even
envy
,
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
Josie
Pye
,
dared
not
deny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
has
n't
it
been
a
brilliant
evening
?
''
sighed
Anne
,
when
it
was
all
*NL*
over
and
she
and
Diana
were
walking
home
together
under
a
dark
,
starry
*NL*
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
went
off
very
well
,
''
said
Diana
practically
.
``
I
guess
we
*NL*
must
have
made
as
much
as
ten
dollars
.
Mind
you
,
Mr.
Allan
is
going
to
*NL*
send
an
account
of
it
to
the
Charlottetown
papers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
will
we
really
see
our
names
in
print
?
It
makes
me
thrill
to
*NL*
think
of
it
.
Your
solo
was
perfectly
elegant
,
Diana
.
I
felt
prouder
than
*NL*
you
did
when
it
was
encored
.
I
just
said
to
myself
,
`
It
is
my
dear
bosom
*NL*
friend
who
is
so
honored
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
recitations
just
brought
down
the
house
,
Anne
.
That
sad
one
*NL*
was
simply
splendid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
was
so
nervous
,
Diana
.
When
Mr.
Allan
called
out
my
name
I
really
*NL*
can
not
tell
how
I
ever
got
up
on
that
platform
.
I
felt
as
if
a
million
*NL*
eyes
were
looking
at
me
and
through
me
,
and
for
one
dreadful
moment
I
*NL*
was
sure
I
could
n't
begin
at
all
.
Then
I
thought
of
my
lovely
puffed
*NL*
sleeves
and
took
courage
.
I
knew
that
I
must
live
up
to
those
sleeves
,
*NL*
Diana
.
So
I
started
in
,
and
my
voice
seemed
to
be
coming
from
ever
so
*NL*
far
away
.
I
just
felt
like
a
parrot
.
It
's
providential
that
I
practiced
*NL*
those
recitations
so
often
up
in
the
garret
,
or
I
'd
never
have
been
able
*NL*
to
get
through
.
Did
I
groan
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
you
groaned
lovely
,
''
assured
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
old
Mrs.
Sloane
wiping
away
tears
when
I
sat
down
.
It
was
*NL*
splendid
to
think
I
had
touched
somebody
's
heart
.
It
's
so
romantic
*NL*
to
take
part
in
a
concert
,
is
n't
it
?
Oh
,
it
's
been
a
very
memorable
*NL*
occasion
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
the
boys
'
dialogue
fine
?
''
said
Diana
.
``
Gilbert
Blythe
was
just
*NL*
splendid
.
Anne
,
I
do
think
it
's
awful
mean
the
way
you
treat
Gil
.
Wait
*NL*
till
I
tell
you
.
When
you
ran
off
the
platform
after
the
fairy
dialogue
*NL*
one
of
your
roses
fell
out
of
your
hair
.
I
saw
Gil
pick
it
up
and
put
*NL*
it
in
his
breast
pocket
.
There
now
.
You
're
so
romantic
that
I
'm
sure
you
*NL*
ought
to
be
pleased
at
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
to
me
what
that
person
does
,
''
said
Anne
loftily
.
``
I
simply
*NL*
never
waste
a
thought
on
him
,
Diana
.

*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Marilla
and
Matthew
,
who
had
been
out
to
a
concert
for
the
*NL*
first
time
in
twenty
years
,
sat
for
a
while
by
the
kitchen
fire
after
*NL*
Anne
had
gone
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
guess
our
Anne
did
as
well
as
any
of
them
,
''
said
Matthew
*NL*
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
did
,
''
admitted
Marilla
.
``
She
's
a
bright
child
,
Matthew
.
And
*NL*
she
looked
real
nice
too
.
I
've
been
kind
of
opposed
to
this
concert
*NL*
scheme
,
but
I
suppose
there
's
no
real
harm
in
it
after
all
.
Anyhow
,
I
*NL*
was
proud
of
Anne
tonight
,
although
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
her
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
was
proud
of
her
and
I
did
tell
her
so
`
fore
she
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
''
said
Matthew
.
``
We
must
see
what
we
can
do
for
her
some
of
*NL*
these
days
,
Marilla
.
I
guess
she
'll
need
something
more
than
Avonlea
*NL*
school
by
and
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
time
enough
to
think
of
that
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
She
's
only
*NL*
thirteen
in
March
.
Though
tonight
it
struck
me
she
was
growing
quite
a
*NL*
big
girl
.
Mrs.
Lynde
made
that
dress
a
mite
too
long
,
and
it
makes
Anne
*NL*
look
so
tall
.
She
's
quick
to
learn
and
I
guess
the
best
thing
we
can
do
*NL*
for
her
will
be
to
send
her
to
Queen
's
after
a
spell
.
But
nothing
need
*NL*
be
said
about
that
for
a
year
or
two
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now

it
'll
do
no
harm
to
be
thinking
it
over
off
and
on

*NL*
Matthew

Things
like
that
are
all
the

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
The
Story
Club
Is
Formed
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Junior
Avonlea
found
it
hard
to
settle
down
to
humdrum
existence
*NL*
again
.
To
Anne
in
particular
things
seemed
fearfully
flat
,
stale
,
and
*NL*
unprofitable
after
the
goblet
of
excitement
she
had
been
sipping
for
*NL*
weeks
.
Could
she
go
back
to
the
former
quiet
pleasures
of
those
faraway
*NL*
days
before
the
concert
?
At
first
,
as
she
told
Diana
,
she
did
not
really
*NL*
think
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
positively
certain
,
Diana
,
that
life
can
never
be
quite
the
*NL*
same
again
as
it
was
in
those
olden
days
,
''
she
said
mournfully
,
as
if
*NL*
referring
to
a
period
of
at
least
fifty
years
back
.
``
Perhaps
after
a
*NL*
while
I
'll
get
used
to
it
,
but
I
'm
afraid
concerts
spoil
people
for
*NL*
everyday
life
.
I
suppose
that
is
why
Marilla
disapproves
of
them
.
*NL*
Marilla
is
such
a
sensible
woman
.
It
must
be
a
great
deal
better
to
be
*NL*
sensible
;
but
still
,
I
do
n't
believe
I
'd
really
want
to
be
a
sensible
*NL*
person
,
because
they
are
so
unromantic
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
there
is
no
*NL*
danger
of
my
ever
being
one
,
but
you
can
never
tell
.
I
feel
just
now
*NL*
that
I
may
grow
up
to
be
sensible
yet
.
But
perhaps
that
is
only
because
*NL*
I
'm
tired
.
I
simply
could
n't
sleep
last
night
for
ever
so
long
.
I
just
*NL*
lay
awake
and
imagined
the
concert
over
and
over
again
.
That
's
one
*NL*
splendid
thing
about
such
affairs
--
it
's
so
lovely
to
look
back
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
,
however
,
Avonlea
school
slipped
back
into
its
old
groove
*NL*
and
took
up
its
old
interests
.
To
be
sure
,
the
concert
left
traces
.
Ruby
*NL*
Gillis
and
Emma
White
,
who
had
quarreled
over
a
point
of
precedence
in
*NL*
their
platform
seats
,
no
longer
sat
at
the
same
desk
,
and
a
promising
*NL*
friendship
of
three
years
was
broken
up
.
Josie
Pye
and
Julia
Bell
did
*NL*
not
``
speak
''
for
three
months
,
because
Josie
Pye
had
told
Bessie
Wright
*NL*
that
Julia
Bell
's
bow
when
she
got
up
to
recite
made
her
think
of
a
*NL*
chicken
jerking
its
head
,
and
Bessie
told
Julia
.
None
of
the
Sloanes
*NL*
would
have
any
dealings
with
the
Bells
,
because
the
Bells
had
declared
*NL*
that
the
Sloanes
had
too
much
to
do
in
the
program
,
and
the
Sloanes
had
*NL*
retorted
that
the
Bells
were
not
capable
of
doing
the
little
they
had
to
*NL*
do
properly
.
Finally
,
Charlie
Sloane
fought
Moody
Spurgeon
MacPherson
,
*NL*
because
Moody
Spurgeon
had
said
that
Anne
Shirley
put
on
airs
about
*NL*
her
recitations
,
and
Moody
Spurgeon
was
``
licked
''
;
consequently
Moody
*NL*
Spurgeon
's
sister
,
Ella
May
,
would
not
``
speak
''
to
Anne
Shirley
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
winter
.
With
the
exception
of
these
trifling
frictions
,
work
*NL*
in
Miss
Stacy
's
little
kingdom
went
on
with
regularity
and
smoothness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
weeks
slipped
by
.
It
was
an
unusually
mild
winter
,
with
so
*NL*
little
snow
that
Anne
and
Diana
could
go
to
school
nearly
every
day
by
*NL*
way
of
the
Birch
Path
.
On
Anne
's
birthday
they
were
tripping
lightly
*NL*
down
it
,
keeping
eyes
and
ears
alert
amid
all
their
chatter
,
for
Miss
*NL*
Stacy
had
told
them
that
they
must
soon
write
a
composition
on
``
A
*NL*
Winter
's
Walk
in
the
Woods
,
''
and
it
behooved
them
to
be
observant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
think
,
Diana
,
I
'm
thirteen
years
old
today
,
''
remarked
Anne
in
an
*NL*
awed
voice
.
``
I
can
scarcely
realize
that
I
'm
in
my
teens
.
When
I
woke
*NL*
this
morning
it
seemed
to
me
that
everything
must
be
different
.
You
've
*NL*
been
thirteen
for
a
month
,
so
I
suppose
it
does
n't
seem
such
a
novelty
*NL*
to
you
as
it
does
to
me
.
It
makes
life
seem
so
much
more
interesting
.
*NL*
In
two
more
years
I
'll
be
really
grown
up
.
It
's
a
great
comfort
to
think
*NL*
that
I
'll
be
able
to
use
big
words
then
without
being
laughed
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ruby
Gillis
says
she
means
to
have
a
beau
as
soon
as
she
's
fifteen
,
''
*NL*
said
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ruby
Gillis
thinks
of
nothing
but
beaus
,
''
said
Anne
disdainfully
.
*NL*
``
She
's
actually
delighted
when
anyone
writes
her
name
up
in
a
*NL*
take-notice
for
all
she
pretends
to
be
so
mad
.
But
I
'm
afraid
that
is
an
*NL*
uncharitable
speech
.
Mrs.
Allan
says
we
should
never
make
uncharitable
*NL*
speeches
;
but
they
do
slip
out
so
often
before
you
think
,
do
n't
they
?
I
*NL*
simply
ca
n't
talk
about
Josie
Pye
without
making
an
uncharitable
speech
,
*NL*
so
I
never
mention
her
at
all
.
You
may
have
noticed
that
.
I
'm
trying
to
*NL*
be
as
much
like
Mrs.
Allan
as
I
possibly
can
,
for
I
think
she
's
perfect
.
*NL*
Mr.
Allan
thinks
so
too
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
he
just
worships
the
ground
she
*NL*
treads
on
and
she
does
n't
really
think
it
right
for
a
minister
to
*NL*
set
his
affections
so
much
on
a
mortal
being
.
But
then
,
Diana
,
even
*NL*
ministers
are
human
and
have
their
besetting
sins
just
like
everybody
*NL*
else
.
I
had
such
an
interesting
talk
with
Mrs.
Allan
about
besetting
*NL*
sins
last
Sunday
afternoon
.
There
are
just
a
few
things
it
's
proper
*NL*
to
talk
about
on
Sundays
and
that
is
one
of
them
.
My
besetting
sin
is
*NL*
imagining
too
much
and
forgetting
my
duties
.
I
'm
striving
very
hard
*NL*
to
overcome
it
and
now
that
I
'm
really
thirteen
perhaps
I
'll
get
on
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
four
more
years
we
'll
be
able
to
put
our
hair
up
,
''
said
Diana
.
*NL*
``
Alice
Bell
is
only
sixteen
and
she
is
wearing
hers
up
,
but
I
think
*NL*
that
's
ridiculous

I
shall
wait
until
I
'm
seventeen

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
Alice
Bell
's
crooked
nose

said
Anne
decidedly
,
``
I
*NL*
would
n't

but
there
!
I
wo
n't
say
what
I
was
going
to
because
it
was
*NL*
extremely
uncharitable
.
Besides
,
I
was
comparing
it
with
my
own
nose
and
*NL*
that
's
vanity
.
I
'm
afraid
I
think
too
much
about
my
nose
ever
since
I
*NL*
heard
that
compliment
about
it
long
ago

It
really
is
a
great
comfort

Oh

Diana
,
look
,
there
's
a
rabbit

That
's
something
to
remember
for
*NL*
our
woods
composition

I
really
think
the
woods
are
just
as
lovely
in
*NL*
winter
as
in
summer
.
They
're
so
white
and
still

were
asleep

dreaming
pretty
dreams

I
wo

sighed

``
I
can
manage
to
write
about
the
woods
,
but
the
one
we
're
to
*NL*
hand
in
Monday
is
terrible
.
The
idea
of
Miss
Stacy
telling
us
to
write
a

story
out
of
our
own
heads

``
Why

Anne

``
It

easy
for
you

you
have
an
imagination

Diana
,
*NL*
``

what
would
you
do
if
you
had
been
born

one

you

all
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
nodded
,
trying
hard
not
to
look
virtuously
complacent
and
failing
*NL*
miserably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wrote
it
last
Monday
evening
.
It
's
called
`
The
Jealous
Rival
;
or
In
*NL*
Death
Not
Divided
.
'
I
read
it
to
Marilla
and
she
said
it
was
stuff
and
*NL*
nonsense
.
Then
I
read
it
to
Matthew
and
he
said
it
was
fine
.
That
is
*NL*
the
kind
of
critic
I
like
.
It
's
a
sad
,
sweet
story
.
I
just
cried
like
*NL*
a
child
while
I
was
writing
it
.
It
's
about
two
beautiful
maidens
called
*NL*
Cordelia
Montmorency
and
Geraldine
Seymour
who
lived
in
the
same
village
*NL*
and
were
devotedly
attached
to
each
other
.
Cordelia
was
a
regal
brunette
*NL*
with
a
coronet
of
midnight
hair
and
duskly
flashing
eyes
.
Geraldine
was
*NL*
a
queenly
blonde
with
hair
like
spun
gold
and
velvety
purple
eyes

I

said
Diana
dubiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
did
I.
I
just
imagined
them
.
I
wanted
something
out
of
the
*NL*
common
.
Geraldine
had
an
alabaster
brow
too
.
I
've
found
out
what
an
*NL*
alabaster
brow
is
.
That
is
one
of
the
advantages
of
being
thirteen
.
You
*NL*
know
so
much
more
than
you
did
when
you
were
only
twelve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
became
of
Cordelia
and
Geraldine
?
''
asked
Diana
,
who
was
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
rather
interested
in
their
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
grew
in
beauty
side
by
side
until
they
were
sixteen
.
Then
Bertram
*NL*
DeVere
came
to
their
native
village
and
fell
in
love
with
the
fair
*NL*
Geraldine
.
He
saved
her
life
when
her
horse
ran
away
with
her
in
a
*NL*
carriage
,
and
she
fainted
in
his
arms
and
he
carried
her
home
three
*NL*
miles
;
because
,
you
understand
,
the
carriage
was
all
smashed
up
.
I
found
*NL*
it
rather
hard
to
imagine
the
proposal
because
I
had
no
experience
to
*NL*
go
by
.
I
asked
Ruby
Gillis
if
she
knew
anything
about
how
men
proposed
*NL*
because
I
thought
she
'd
likely
be
an
authority
on
the
subject
,
having
so
*NL*
many
sisters
married
.
Ruby
told
me
she
was
hid
in
the
hall
pantry
when
*NL*
Malcolm
Andres
proposed
to
her
sister
Susan
.
She
said
Malcolm
told
Susan
*NL*
that
his
dad
had
given
him
the
farm
in
his
own
name
and
then
said
,
`
What
*NL*
do
you
say
,
darling
pet
,
if
we
get
hitched
this
fall
?
'
And
Susan
said
,
*NL*
`
Yes
--
no
--
I
do
n't
know
--
let
me
see
'
--
and
there
they
were
,
engaged
as
*NL*
quick
as
that
.
But
I
did
n't
think
that
sort
of
a
proposal
was
a
very
*NL*
romantic
one
,
so
in
the
end
I
had
to
imagine
it
out
as
well
as
I
could
.
*NL*
I
made
it
very
flowery
and
poetical
and
Bertram
went
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
although
Ruby
Gillis
says
it
is
n't
done
nowadays
.
Geraldine
accepted
*NL*
him
in
a
speech
a
page
long
.
I
can
tell
you
I
took
a
lot
of
trouble
*NL*
with
that
speech
.
I
rewrote
it
five
times
and
I
look
upon
it
as
my
*NL*
masterpiece
.
Bertram
gave
her
a
diamond
ring
and
a
ruby
necklace
*NL*
and
told
her
they
would
go
to
Europe
for
a
wedding
tour
,
for
he
was
*NL*
immensely
wealthy
.
But
then
,
alas
,
shadows
began
to
darken
over
their
*NL*
path
.
Cordelia
was
secretly
in
love
with
Bertram
herself
and
when
*NL*
Geraldine
told
her
about
the
engagement
she
was
simply
furious
,
*NL*
especially
when
she
saw
the
necklace
and
the
diamond
ring
.
All
her
*NL*
affection
for
Geraldine
turned
to
bitter
hate
and
she
vowed
that
she
*NL*
should
never
marry
Bertram
.
But
she
pretended
to
be
Geraldine
's
friend
*NL*
the
same
as
ever
.
One
evening
they
were
standing
on
the
bridge
over
a
*NL*
rushing
turbulent
stream
and
Cordelia
,
thinking
they
were
alone
,
pushed
*NL*
Geraldine
over
the
brink
with
a
wild
,
mocking
,
`
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
.
'
But
Bertram
*NL*
saw
it
all
and
he
at
once
plunged
into
the
current
,
exclaiming
,
'
I
*NL*
will
save
thee
,
my
peerless
Geraldine
.
'
But
alas
,
he
had
forgotten
he
*NL*
could
n't
swim
,
and
they
were
both
drowned
,
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
.
*NL*
Their
bodies
were
washed
ashore
soon
afterwards
.
They
were
buried
in
the
*NL*
one
grave
and
their
funeral
was
most
imposing
,
Diana
.
It
's
so
much
*NL*
more
romantic
to
end
a
story
up
with
a
funeral
than
a
wedding
.
As
for
*NL*
Cordelia
,
she
went
insane
with
remorse
and
was
shut
up
in
a
lunatic
*NL*
asylum
.
I
thought
that
was
a
poetical
retribution
for
her
crime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
perfectly
lovely
!
''
sighed
Diana
,
who
belonged
to
Matthew
's
school
*NL*
of
critics
.
``
I
do
n't
see
how
you
can
make
up
such
thrilling
things
out
*NL*
of
your
own
head
,
Anne
.
I
wish
my
imagination
was
as
good
as
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
if
you
'd
only
cultivate
it
,
''
said
Anne
cheeringly
.
``
I
've
*NL*
just
thought
of
a
plan
,
Diana
.
Let
you
and
me
have
a
story
club
all
our
*NL*
own
and
write
stories
for
practice
.
I
'll
help
you
along
until
you
can
*NL*
do
them
by
yourself
.
You
ought
to
cultivate
your
imagination
,
you
know
.
*NL*
Miss
Stacy
says
so
.
Only
we
must
take
the
right
way
.
I
told
her
about
*NL*
the
Haunted
Wood
,
but
she
said
we
went
the
wrong
way
about
it
in
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
how
the
story
club
came
into
existence
.
It
was
limited
to
Diana
*NL*
and
Anne
at
first
,
but
soon
it
was
extended
to
include
Jane
Andrews
*NL*
and
Ruby
Gillis
and
one
or
two
others
who
felt
that
their
imaginations
*NL*
needed
cultivating
.
No
boys
were
allowed
in
it
--
although
Ruby
Gillis
*NL*
opined
that
their
admission
would
make
it
more
exciting
--
and
each
member
*NL*
had
to
produce
one
story
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
extremely
interesting
,
''
Anne
told
Marilla
.
``
Each
girl
has
to
read
*NL*
her
story
out
loud
and
then
we
talk
it
over
.
We
are
going
to
keep
them
*NL*
all
sacredly
and
have
them
to
read
to
our
descendants
.
We
each
write
*NL*
under
a
nom-de-plume
.
Mine
is
Rosamond
Montmorency
.
All
the
girls
*NL*
do
pretty
well
.
Ruby
Gillis
is
rather
sentimental
.
She
puts
too
much
*NL*
lovemaking
into
her
stories
and
you
know
too
much
is
worse
than
too
*NL*
little
.
Jane
never
puts
any
because
she
says
it
makes
her
feel
so
silly
*NL*
when
she
had
to
read
it
out
loud
.
Jane
's
stories
are
extremely
sensible
.
*NL*
Then
Diana
puts
too
many
murders
into
hers
.
She
says
most
of
the
time
*NL*
she
does
n't
know
what
to
do
with
the
people
so
she
kills
them
off
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
them
.
I
mostly
always
have
to
tell
them
what
to
write
about
,
but
*NL*
that
is
n't
hard
for
I
've
millions
of
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
this
story-writing
business
is
the
foolishest
yet
,
''
scoffed
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
You
'll
get
a
pack
of
nonsense
into
your
heads
and
waste
time
*NL*
that
should
be
put
on
your
lessons
.
Reading
stories
is
bad
enough
but
*NL*
writing
them
is
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
're
so
careful
to
put
a
moral
into
them
all
,
Marilla
,
''
explained
*NL*
Anne
.
``
I
insist
upon
that
.
All
the
good
people
are
rewarded
and
all
*NL*
the
bad
ones
are
suitably
punished
.
I
'm
sure
that
must
have
a
wholesome
*NL*
effect
.
The
moral
is
the
great
thing
.
Mr.
Allan
says
so
.
I
read
one
of
*NL*
my
stories
to
him
and
Mrs.
Allan
and
they
both
agreed
that
the
moral
was
*NL*
excellent
.
Only
they
laughed
in
the
wrong
places
.
I
like
it
better
when
*NL*
people
cry
.
Jane
and
Ruby
almost
always
cry
when
I
come
to
the
pathetic
*NL*
parts
.
Diana
wrote
her
Aunt
Josephine
about
our
club
and
her
Aunt
*NL*
Josephine
wrote
back
that
we
were
to
send
her
some
of
our
stories
.
So
*NL*
we
copied
out
four
of
our
very
best
and
sent
them
.
Miss
Josephine
Barry
*NL*
wrote
back
that
she
had
never
read
anything
so
amusing
in
her
life
.
That
*NL*
kind
of
puzzled
us
because
the
stories
were
all
very
pathetic
and
almost
*NL*
everybody
died
.
But
I
'm
glad
Miss
Barry
liked
them
.
It
shows
our
club
*NL*
is
doing
some
good
in
the
world
.
Mrs.
Allan
says
that
ought
to
be
our
*NL*
object
in
everything
.
I
do
really
try
to
make
it
my
object
but
I
forget
*NL*
so
often
when
I
'm
having
fun
.
I
hope
I
shall
be
a
little
like
Mrs.
Allan
*NL*
when
I
grow
up
.
Do
you
think
there
is
any
prospect
of
it
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
say
there
was
a
great
deal
''
was
Marilla
's
encouraging
*NL*
answer
.
``
I
'm
sure
Mrs.
Allan
was
never
such
a
silly
,
forgetful
little
*NL*
girl
as
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
she
was
n't
always
so
good
as
she
is
now
either
,
''
said
Anne
*NL*
seriously
.
``
She
told
me
so
herself
--
that
is
,
she
said
she
was
a
dreadful
*NL*
mischief
when
she
was
a
girl
and
was
always
getting
into
scrapes
.
I
felt
*NL*
so
encouraged
when
I
heard
that
.
Is
it
very
wicked
of
me
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
to
feel
encouraged
when
I
hear
that
other
people
have
been
bad
and
*NL*
mischievous
?
Mrs.
Lynde
says
it
is
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
she
always
feels
*NL*
shocked
when
she
hears
of
anyone
ever
having
been
naughty
,
no
matter
how
*NL*
small
they
were
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
she
once
heard
a
minister
confess
that
*NL*
when
he
was
a
boy
he
stole
a
strawberry
tart
out
of
his
aunt
's
pantry
*NL*
and
she
never
had
any
respect
for
that
minister
again
.
Now
,
I
would
n't
*NL*
have
felt
that
way
.
I
'd
have
thought
that
it
was
real
noble
of
him
to
*NL*
confess
it
,
and
I
'd
have
thought
what
an
encouraging
thing
it
would
be
*NL*
for
small
boys
nowadays
who
do
naughty
things
and
are
sorry
for
them
*NL*
to
know
that
perhaps
they
may
grow
up
to
be
ministers
in
spite
of
it
.
*NL*
That
's
how
I
'd
feel
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
I
feel
at
present
,
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
,
``
is
that
it
's
high
time
*NL*
you
had
those
dishes
washed

You

taken
half
an

than

afterwards

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
Vanity
and
Vexation
of
Spirit
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
,
walking
home
one
late
April
evening
from
an
Aid
meeting
,
*NL*
realized
that
the
winter
was
over
and
gone
with
the
thrill
of
delight
*NL*
that
spring
never
fails
to
bring
to
the
oldest
and
saddest
as
well
as
to
*NL*
the
youngest
and
merriest
.
Marilla
was
not
given
to
subjective
analysis
*NL*
of
her
thoughts
and
feelings
.
She
probably
imagined
that
she
was
*NL*
thinking
about
the
Aids
and
their
missionary
box
and
the
new
carpet
*NL*
for
the
vestry
room
,
but
under
these
reflections
was
a
harmonious
*NL*
consciousness
of
red
fields
smoking
into
pale-purply
mists
in
the
*NL*
declining
sun
,
of
long
,
sharp-pointed
fir
shadows
falling
over
the
*NL*
meadow
beyond
the
brook
,
of
still
,
crimson-budded
maples
around
a
*NL*
mirrorlike
wood
pool
,
of
a
wakening
in
the
world
and
a
stir
of
hidden
*NL*
pulses
under
the
gray
sod
.
The
spring
was
abroad
in
the
land
and
*NL*
Marilla
's
sober
,
middle-aged
step
was
lighter
and
swifter
because
of
its
*NL*
deep
,
primal
gladness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
dwelt
affectionately
on
Green
Gables
,
peering
through
its
*NL*
network
of
trees
and
reflecting
the
sunlight
back
from
its
windows
in
*NL*
several
little
coruscations
of
glory
.
Marilla
,
as
she
picked
her
steps
*NL*
along
the
damp
lane
,
thought
that
it
was
really
a
satisfaction
to
know
*NL*
that
she
was
going
home
to
a
briskly
snapping
wood
fire
and
a
table
*NL*
nicely
spread
for
tea
,
instead
of
to
the
cold
comfort
of
old
Aid
meeting
*NL*
evenings
before
Anne
had
come
to
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consequently
,
when
Marilla
entered
her
kitchen
and
found
the
fire
black
*NL*
out
,
with
no
sign
of
Anne
anywhere
,
she
felt
justly
disappointed
and
*NL*
irritated
.
She
had
told
Anne
to
be
sure
and
have
tea
ready
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
,
but
now
she
must
hurry
to
take
off
her
second-best
dress
and
*NL*
prepare
the
meal
herself
against
Matthew
's
return
from
plowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
settle
Miss
Anne
when
she
comes
home
,
''
said
Marilla
grimly
,
as
*NL*
she
shaved
up
kindlings
with
a
carving
knife
and
with
more
vim
than
was
*NL*
strictly
necessary
.
Matthew
had
come
in
and
was
waiting
patiently
for
*NL*
his
tea
in
his
corner
.
``
She
's
gadding
off
somewhere
with
Diana
,
writing
*NL*
stories
or
practicing
dialogues
or
some
such
tomfoolery
,
and
never
*NL*
thinking
once
about
the
time
or
her
duties
.
She
's
just
got
to
be
pulled
*NL*
up
short
and
sudden
on
this
sort
of
thing
.
I
do
n't
care
if
Mrs.
Allan
*NL*
does
say
she
's
the
brightest
and
sweetest
child
she
ever
knew
.
She
may
*NL*
be
bright
and
sweet
enough
,
but
her
head
is
full
of
nonsense
and
there
's
*NL*
never
any
knowing
what
shape
it
'll
break
out
in
next
.
Just
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
grows
out
of
one
freak
she
takes
up
with
another
.
But
there
!
Here
I
*NL*
am
saying
the
very
thing
I
was
so
riled
with
Rachel
Lynde
for
saying
at
*NL*
the
Aid
today
.
I
was
real
glad
when
Mrs.
Allan
spoke
up
for
Anne
,
for
*NL*
if
she
had
n't
I
know
I
'd
have
said
something
too
sharp
to
Rachel
before
*NL*
everybody
.
Anne
's
got
plenty
of
faults
,
goodness
knows
,
and
far
be
it
*NL*
from
me
to
deny
it
.
But
I
'm
bringing
her
up
and
not
Rachel
Lynde
,
who
'd
*NL*
pick
faults
in
the
Angel
Gabriel
himself
if
he
lived
in
Avonlea
.
Just
*NL*
the
same
,
Anne
has
no
business
to
leave
the
house
like
this
when
I
told
*NL*
her
she
was
to
stay
home
this
afternoon
and
look
after
things
.
I
must
*NL*
say
,
with
all
her
faults
,
I
never
found
her
disobedient
or
untrustworthy
*NL*
before
and
I
'm
real
sorry
to
find
her
so
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
dunno
,
''
said
Matthew
,
who
,
being
patient
and
wise
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
hungry
,
had
deemed
it
best
to
let
Marilla
talk
her
wrath
*NL*
out
unhindered
,
having
learned
by
experience
that
she
got
through
*NL*
with
whatever
work
was
on
hand
much
quicker
if
not
delayed
by
untimely
*NL*
argument
.
``
Perhaps
you
're
judging
her
too
hasty
,
Marilla
.
Do
n't
call
her
*NL*
untrustworthy
until
you
're
sure
she
has
disobeyed
you
.
Mebbe
it
can
all
*NL*
be
explained
--
Anne
's
a
great
hand
at
explaining
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
here
when
I
told
her
to
stay
,
''
retorted
Marilla
.
``
I
reckon
*NL*
she
'll
find
it
hard
to
explain
THAT
to
my
satisfaction
.
Of
course
I
knew
*NL*
you
'd
take
her
part
,
Matthew
.
But
I
'm
bringing
her
up
,
not
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
when
supper
was
ready
,
and
still
no
sign
of
Anne
,
coming
*NL*
hurriedly
over
the
log
bridge
or
up
Lover
's
Lane
,
breathless
and
*NL*
repentant
with
a
sense
of
neglected
duties
.
Marilla
washed
and
put
away
*NL*
the
dishes
grimly
.
Then
,
wanting
a
candle
to
light
her
way
down
the
*NL*
cellar
,
she
went
up
to
the
east
gable
for
the
one
that
generally
stood
*NL*
on
Anne
's
table
.
Lighting
it
,
she
turned
around
to
see
Anne
herself
*NL*
lying
on
the
bed
,
face
downward
among
the
pillows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
,
''
said
astonished
Marilla
,
``
have
you
been
asleep
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
was
the
muffled
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sick
then
?
''
demanded
Marilla
anxiously
,
going
over
to
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
cowered
deeper
into
her
pillows
as
if
desirous
of
hiding
herself
*NL*
forever
from
mortal
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
But
please
,
Marilla
,
go
away
and
do
n't
look
at
me
.
I
'm
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
despair
and
I
do
n't
care
who
gets
head
in
class
or
writes
the
*NL*
best
composition
or
sings
in
the
Sunday-school
choir
any
more
.
Little
*NL*
things
like
that
are
of
no
importance
now
because
I
do
n't
suppose
I
'll
*NL*
ever
be
able
to
go
anywhere
again
.
My
career
is
closed
.
Please
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
go
away
and
do
n't
look
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anyone
ever
hear
the
like
?
''
the
mystified
Marilla
wanted
to
know
.
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you

What
have
you
done

Get
*NL*
right
up
this
minute
and
tell
me
.
This
minute
,
I
say
.
There
now
,
what
is
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
slid
to
the
floor
in
despairing
obedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
my
hair
,
Marilla
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
Marilla
lifted
her
candle
and
looked
scrutinizingly
at
*NL*
Anne
's
hair
,
flowing
in
heavy
masses
down
her
back
.
It
certainly
had
a
*NL*
very
strange
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
what
have
you
done
to
your
hair
?
Why
,
it
's
GREEN
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Green
it
might
be
called
,
if
it
were
any
earthly
color
--
a
queer
,
*NL*
dull
,
bronzy
green
,
with
streaks
here
and
there
of
the
original
red
*NL*
to
heighten
the
ghastly
effect
.
Never
in
all
her
life
had
Marilla
seen
*NL*
anything
so
grotesque
as
Anne
's
hair
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
green
,
''
moaned
Anne
.
``
I
thought
nothing
could
be
as
bad
as
*NL*
red
hair
.
But
now
I
know
it
's
ten
times
worse
to
have
green
hair
.
Oh
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
you
little
know
how
utterly
wretched
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
little
know
how
you
got
into
this
fix
,
but
I
mean
to
find
out
,
''
said
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
Come
right
down
to
the
kitchen
--
it
's
too
cold
up
here
--
and
*NL*
tell
me
just
what
you
've
done
.
I
've
been
expecting
something
queer
for
*NL*
some
time
.
You
have
n't
got
into
any
scrape
for
over
two
months
,
and
I
*NL*
was
sure
another
one
was
due
.
Now
,
then
,
what
did
you
do
to
your
hair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dyed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dyed
it
!
Dyed
your
hair
!
Anne
Shirley
,
did
n't
you
know
it
was
a
wicked
*NL*
thing
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
knew
it
was
a
little
wicked
,
''
admitted
Anne
.
``
But
I
thought
it
*NL*
was
worth
while
to
be
a
little
wicked
to
get
rid
of
red
hair
.
I
counted
*NL*
the
cost
,
Marilla
.
Besides
,
I
meant
to
be
extra
good
in
other
ways
to
*NL*
make
up
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Marilla
sarcastically
,
``
if
I
'd
decided
it
was
worth
while
*NL*
to
dye
my
hair
I
'd
have
dyed
it
a
decent
color
at
least
.
I
would
n't
have
*NL*
dyed
it
green
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
did
n't
mean
to
dye
it
green
,
Marilla
,
''
protested
Anne
dejectedly
.
*NL*
``
If
I
was
wicked
I
meant
to
be
wicked
to
some
purpose
.
He
said
it
would
*NL*
turn
my
hair
a
beautiful
raven
black
--
he
positively
assured
me
that
it
*NL*
would
.
How
could
I
doubt
his
word
,
Marilla
?
I
know
what
it
feels
like
*NL*
to
have
your
word
doubted
.
And
Mrs.
Allan
says
we
should
never
suspect
*NL*
anyone
of
not
telling
us
the
truth
unless
we
have
proof
that
they
're
*NL*
not
.
I
have
proof
now
--
green
hair
is
proof
enough
for
anybody
.
But
I
*NL*
had
n't
then
and
I
believed
every
word
he
said
IMPLICITLY
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
said
?
Who
are
you
talking
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
peddler
that
was
here
this
afternoon
.
I
bought
the
dye
from
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
,
how
often
have
I
told
you
never
to
let
one
of
those
*NL*
Italians
in
the
house
!
I
do
n't
believe
in
encouraging
them
to
come
*NL*
around
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
let
him
in
the
house
.
I
remembered
what
you
told
me
,
and
I
*NL*
went
out
,
carefully
shut
the
door
,
and
looked
at
his
things
on
the
step
.
*NL*
Besides
,
he
was
n't
an
Italian
--
he
was
a
German
Jew
.
He
had
a
big
box
*NL*
full
of
very
interesting
things
and
he
told
me
he
was
working
hard
to
*NL*
make
enough
money
to
bring
his
wife
and
children
out
from
Germany
.
He
*NL*
spoke
so
feelingly
about
them
that
it
touched
my
heart
.
I
wanted
to
buy
*NL*
something
from
him
to
help
him
in
such
a
worthy
object
.
Then
all
at
once
*NL*
I
saw
the
bottle
of
hair
dye
.
The
peddler
said
it
was
warranted
to
dye
*NL*
any
hair
a
beautiful
raven
black
and
would
n't
wash
off
.
In
a
trice
I
*NL*
saw
myself
with
beautiful
raven-black
hair
and
the
temptation
was
*NL*
irresistible
.
But
the
price
of
the
bottle
was
seventy-five
cents
and
I
*NL*
had
only
fifty
cents
left
out
of
my
chicken
money
.
I
think
the
peddler
*NL*
had
a
very
kind
heart
,
for
he
said
that
,
seeing
it
was
me
,
he
'd
sell
it
*NL*
for
fifty
cents
and
that
was
just
giving
it
away
.
So
I
bought
it
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
gone
I
came
up
here
and
applied
it
with
an
old
hairbrush
*NL*
as
the
directions
said
.
I
used
up
the
whole
bottle
,
and
oh
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
when
I
saw
the
dreadful
color
it
turned
my
hair
I
repented
of
being
*NL*
wicked
,
I
can
tell
you
.
And
I
've
been
repenting
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
you
'll
repent
to
good
purpose
,
''
said
Marilla
severely
,
*NL*
``
and
that
you
've
got
your
eyes
opened
to
where
your
vanity
has
led
you
,
*NL*
Anne
.
Goodness
knows
what
's
to
be
done
.
I
suppose
the
first
thing
is
to
*NL*
give
your
hair
a
good
washing
and
see
if
that
will
do
any
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
Anne
washed
her
hair
,
scrubbing
it
vigorously
with
soap
and
*NL*
water
,
but
for
all
the
difference
it
made
she
might
as
well
have
been
*NL*
scouring
its
original
red
.
The
peddler
had
certainly
spoken
the
truth
*NL*
when
he
declared
that
the
dye
would
n't
wash
off
,
however
his
veracity
*NL*
might
be
impeached
in
other
respects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
what
shall
I
do
?
''
questioned
Anne
in
tears
.
``
I
can
never
*NL*
live
this
down
.
People
have
pretty
well
forgotten
my
other
mistakes
--
the
*NL*
liniment
cake
and
setting
Diana
drunk
and
flying
into
a
temper
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
.
But
they
'll
never
forget
this
.
They
will
think
I
am
not
*NL*
respectable
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
`
what
a
tangled
web
we
weave
when
first
we
*NL*
practice
to
deceive
.
'
That
is
poetry
,
but
it
is
true
.
And
oh
,
how
Josie
*NL*
Pye
will
laugh
!
Marilla
,
I
CAN
NOT
face
Josie
Pye
.
I
am
the
unhappiest
*NL*
girl
in
Prince
Edward
Island
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
unhappiness
continued
for
a
week
.
During
that
time
she
went
*NL*
nowhere
and
shampooed
her
hair
every
day
.
Diana
alone
of
outsiders
knew
*NL*
the
fatal
secret
,
but
she
promised
solemnly
never
to
tell
,
and
it
may
*NL*
be
stated
here
and
now
that
she
kept
her
word
.
At
the
end
of
the
week
*NL*
Marilla
said
decidedly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
,
Anne
.
That
is
fast
dye
if
ever
there
was
any
.
Your
hair
*NL*
must
be
cut
off
;
there
is
no
other
way
.
You
ca
n't
go
out
with
it
looking
*NL*
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
lips
quivered
,
but
she
realized
the
bitter
truth
of
Marilla
's
*NL*
remarks
.
With
a
dismal
sigh
she
went
for
the
scissors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
cut
it
off
at
once
,
Marilla
,
and
have
it
over
.
Oh
,
I
feel
that
*NL*
my
heart
is
broken
.
This
is
such
an
unromantic
affliction
.
The
girls
in
*NL*
books
lose
their
hair
in
fevers
or
sell
it
to
get
money
for
some
good
*NL*
deed
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
mind
losing
my
hair
in
some
such
fashion
*NL*
half
so
much
.
But
there
is
nothing
comforting
in
having
your
hair
cut
*NL*
off
because
you
've
dyed
it
a
dreadful
color
,
is
there
?
I
'm
going
to
weep
*NL*
all
the
time
you
're
cutting
it
off
,
if
it
wo
n't
interfere
.
It
seems
such
*NL*
a
tragic
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
wept
then
,
but
later
on
,
when
she
went
upstairs
and
looked
in
the
*NL*
glass
,
she
was
calm
with
despair
.
Marilla
had
done
her
work
thoroughly
*NL*
and
it
had
been
necessary
to
shingle
the
hair
as
closely
as
possible
.
*NL*
The
result
was
not
becoming
,
to
state
the
case
as
mildly
as
may
be
.
Anne
*NL*
promptly
turned
her
glass
to
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
never
,
never
look
at
myself
again
until
my
hair
grows
,
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
suddenly
righted
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
,
too
.
I
'd
do
penance
for
being
wicked
that
way
.
I
'll
look
*NL*
at
myself
every
time
I
come
to
my
room
and
see
how
ugly
I
am
.
And
I
*NL*
wo
n't
try
to
imagine
it
away
,
either
.
I
never
thought
I
was
vain
about
*NL*
my
hair
,
of
all
things
,
but
now
I
know
I
was
,
in
spite
of
its
being
*NL*
red
,
because
it
was
so
long
and
thick
and
curly
.
I
expect
something
will
*NL*
happen
to
my
nose
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
clipped
head
made
a
sensation
in
school
on
the
following
Monday
,
*NL*
but
to
her
relief
nobody
guessed
the
real
reason
for
it
,
not
even
Josie
*NL*
Pye
,
who
,
however
,
did
not
fail
to
inform
Anne
that
she
looked
like
a
*NL*
perfect
scarecrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
anything
when
Josie
said
that
to
me
,
''
Anne
confided
*NL*
that
evening
to
Marilla
,
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
after
one
of
her
*NL*
headaches
,
``
because
I
thought
it
was
part
of
my
punishment
and
I
ought
*NL*
to
bear
it
patiently
.
It
's
hard
to
be
told
you
look
like
a
scarecrow
*NL*
and
I
wanted
to
say
something
back
.
But
I
did
n't
.
I
just
swept
her
one
*NL*
scornful
look
and
then
I
forgave
her
.
It
makes
you
feel
very
virtuous
*NL*
when
you
forgive
people
,
does
n't
it
?
I
mean
to
devote
all
my
energies
*NL*
to
being
good
after
this
and
I
shall
never
try
to
be
beautiful
again
.
Of
*NL*
course
it
's
better
to
be
good
.
I
know
it
is
,
but
it
's
sometimes
so
hard
*NL*
to
believe
a
thing
even
when
you
know
it
.
I
do
really
want
to
be
good
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
like
you
and
Mrs.
Allan
and
Miss
Stacy
,
and
grow
up
to
be
a
*NL*
credit
to
you
.
Diana
says
when
my
hair
begins
to
grow
to
tie
a
black
*NL*
velvet
ribbon
around
my
head
with
a
bow
at
one
side
.
She
says
she
*NL*
thinks
it
will
be
very
becoming
.
I
will
call
it
a
snood
--
that
sounds
so
*NL*
romantic
.
But
am
I
talking
too
much
,
Marilla
?
Does
it
hurt
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
is
better
now

It
was
terrible
bad
this
afternoon
,
though

*NL*
These
headaches
of
mine
are
getting
worse
and
worse

I
'll

CHAPTER
XXVIII
.
An
Unfortunate
Lily
Maid
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
OF
course
you
must
be
Elaine
,
Anne
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
I
could
never
have
*NL*
the
courage
to
float
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
said
Ruby
Gillis
,
with
a
shiver
.
``
I
do
n't
mind
floating
down
*NL*
when
there
's
two
or
three
of
us
in
the
flat
and
we
can
sit
up
.
It
's
fun
*NL*
then
.
But
to
lie
down
and
pretend
I
was
dead
--
I
just
could
n't
.
I
'd
die
*NL*
really
of
fright
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
would
be
romantic
,
''
conceded
Jane
Andrews
,
``
but
I
know
I
*NL*
could
n't
keep
still
.
I
'd
be
popping
up
every
minute
or
so
to
see
where
I
*NL*
was
and
if
I
was
n't
drifting
too
far
out
.
And
you
know
,
Anne
,
that
would
*NL*
spoil
the
effect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
so
ridiculous
to
have
a
redheaded
Elaine
,
''
mourned
Anne
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
not
afraid
to
float
down
and
I
'd
love
to
be
Elaine
.
But
it
's
ridiculous
*NL*
just
the
same
.
Ruby
ought
to
be
Elaine
because
she
is
so
fair
and
has
*NL*
such
lovely
long
golden
hair
--
Elaine
had
`
all
her
bright
hair
streaming
*NL*
down
,
'
you
know
.
And
Elaine
was
the
lily
maid
.
Now
,
a
red-haired
person
*NL*
can
not
be
a
lily
maid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
complexion
is
just
as
fair
as
Ruby
's
,
''
said
Diana
earnestly
,
``
and
*NL*
your
hair
is
ever
so
much
darker
than
it
used
to
be
before
you
cut
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
really
think
so
?
''
exclaimed
Anne
,
flushing
sensitively
with
*NL*
delight
.
``
I
've
sometimes
thought
it
was
myself
--
but
I
never
dared
to
ask
*NL*
anyone
for
fear
she
would
tell
me
it
was
n't
.
Do
you
think
it
could
be
*NL*
called
auburn
now
,
Diana
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
think
it
is
real
pretty
,
''
said
Diana
,
looking
admiringly
at
*NL*
the
short
,
silky
curls
that
clustered
over
Anne
's
head
and
were
held
in
*NL*
place
by
a
very
jaunty
black
velvet
ribbon
and
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
standing
on
the
bank
of
the
pond
,
below
Orchard
Slope
,
where
*NL*
a
little
headland
fringed
with
birches
ran
out
from
the
bank
;
at
its
tip
*NL*
was
a
small
wooden
platform
built
out
into
the
water
for
the
convenience
*NL*
of
fishermen
and
duck
hunters
.
Ruby
and
Jane
were
spending
the
midsummer
*NL*
afternoon
with
Diana
,
and
Anne
had
come
over
to
play
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
Diana
had
spent
most
of
their
playtime
that
summer
on
and
about
*NL*
the
pond
.
Idlewild
was
a
thing
of
the
past
,
Mr.
Bell
having
ruthlessly
*NL*
cut
down
the
little
circle
of
trees
in
his
back
pasture
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
Anne
had
sat
among
the
stumps
and
wept
,
not
without
an
eye
to
the
*NL*
romance
of
it
;
but
she
was
speedily
consoled
,
for
,
after
all
,
as
she
and
*NL*
Diana
said
,
big
girls
of
thirteen
,
going
on
fourteen
,
were
too
old
for
*NL*
such
childish
amusements
as
playhouses
,
and
there
were
more
fascinating
*NL*
sports
to
be
found
about
the
pond
.
It
was
splendid
to
fish
for
trout
*NL*
over
the
bridge
and
the
two
girls
learned
to
row
themselves
about
in
the
*NL*
little
flat-bottomed
dory
Mr.
Barry
kept
for
duck
shooting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Anne
's
idea
that
they
dramatize
Elaine
.
They
had
studied
*NL*
Tennyson
's
poem
in
school
the
preceding
winter
,
the
Superintendent
of
*NL*
Education
having
prescribed
it
in
the
English
course
for
the
Prince
*NL*
Edward
Island
schools
.
They
had
analyzed
and
parsed
it
and
torn
it
to
*NL*
pieces
in
general
until
it
was
a
wonder
there
was
any
meaning
at
all
*NL*
left
in
it
for
them
,
but
at
least
the
fair
lily
maid
and
Lancelot
and
*NL*
Guinevere
and
King
Arthur
had
become
very
real
people
to
them
,
and
Anne
*NL*
was
devoured
by
secret
regret
that
she
had
not
been
born
in
Camelot
.
*NL*
Those
days
,
she
said
,
were
so
much
more
romantic
than
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
plan
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
.
The
girls
had
discovered
that
if
*NL*
the
flat
were
pushed
off
from
the
landing
place
it
would
drift
down
*NL*
with
the
current
under
the
bridge
and
finally
strand
itself
on
another
*NL*
headland
lower
down
which
ran
out
at
a
curve
in
the
pond
.
They
had
often
*NL*
gone
down
like
this
and
nothing
could
be
more
convenient
for
playing
*NL*
Elaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
Elaine
,
''
said
Anne
,
yielding
reluctantly
,
for
,
although
*NL*
she
would
have
been
delighted
to
play
the
principal
character
,
yet
*NL*
her
artistic
sense
demanded
fitness
for
it
and
this
,
she
felt
,
her
*NL*
limitations
made
impossible
.
``
Ruby
,
you
must
be
King
Arthur
and
Jane
*NL*
will
be
Guinevere
and
Diana
must
be
Lancelot
.
But
first
you
must
be
the
*NL*
brothers
and
the
father
.
We
ca
n't
have
the
old
dumb
servitor
because
*NL*
there
is
n't
room
for
two
in
the
flat
when
one
is
lying
down
.
We
must
*NL*
pall
the
barge
all
its
length
in
blackest
samite
.
That
old
black
shawl
*NL*
of
your
mother
's
will
be
just
the
thing
,
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
black
shawl
having
been
procured
,
Anne
spread
it
over
the
flat
and
*NL*
then
lay
down
on
the
bottom
,
with
closed
eyes
and
hands
folded
over
her
*NL*
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
does
look
really
dead
,
''
whispered
Ruby
Gillis
nervously
,
*NL*
watching
the
still
,
white
little
face
under
the
flickering
shadows
of
*NL*
the
birches
.
``
It
makes
me
feel
frightened
,
girls
.
Do
you
suppose
it
's
*NL*
really
right
to
act
like
this
?
Mrs.
Lynde
says
that
all
play-acting
is
*NL*
abominably
wicked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ruby
,
you
should
n't
talk
about
Mrs.
Lynde
,
''
said
Anne
severely
.
``
It
*NL*
spoils
the
effect
because
this
is
hundreds
of
years
before
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
was
born
.
Jane
,
you
arrange
this
.
It
's
silly
for
Elaine
to
be
talking
*NL*
when
she
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
rose
to
the
occasion
.
Cloth
of
gold
for
coverlet
there
was
none
,
*NL*
but
an
old
piano
scarf
of
yellow
Japanese
crepe
was
an
excellent
*NL*
substitute
.
A
white
lily
was
not
obtainable
just
then
,
but
the
effect
of
*NL*
a
tall
blue
iris
placed
in
one
of
Anne
's
folded
hands
was
all
that
could
*NL*
be
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
she
's
all
ready
,
''
said
Jane
.
``
We
must
kiss
her
quiet
brows
*NL*
and
,
Diana
,
you
say
,
`
Sister
,
farewell
forever
,
'
and
Ruby
,
you
say
,
*NL*
`
Farewell
,
sweet
sister
,
'
both
of
you
as
sorrowfully
as
you
possibly
*NL*
can
.
Anne
,
for
goodness
sake
smile
a
little
.
You
know
Elaine
`
lay
as
*NL*
though
she
smiled
.
'
That
's
better
.
Now
push
the
flat
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flat
was
accordingly
pushed
off
,
scraping
roughly
over
an
old
*NL*
embedded
stake
in
the
process
.
Diana
and
Jane
and
Ruby
only
waited
long
*NL*
enough
to
see
it
caught
in
the
current
and
headed
for
the
bridge
before
*NL*
scampering
up
through
the
woods
,
across
the
road
,
and
down
to
the
lower
*NL*
headland
where
,
as
Lancelot
and
Guinevere
and
the
King
,
they
were
to
be
*NL*
in
readiness
to
receive
the
lily
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
minutes
Anne
,
drifting
slowly
down
,
enjoyed
the
romance
of
her
*NL*
situation
to
the
full
.
Then
something
happened
not
at
all
romantic
.
The
*NL*
flat
began
to
leak
.
In
a
very
few
moments
it
was
necessary
for
Elaine
*NL*
to
scramble
to
her
feet
,
pick
up
her
cloth
of
gold
coverlet
and
pall
*NL*
of
blackest
samite
and
gaze
blankly
at
a
big
crack
in
the
bottom
of
her
*NL*
barge
through
which
the
water
was
literally
pouring
.
That
sharp
stake
at
*NL*
the
landing
had
torn
off
the
strip
of
batting
nailed
on
the
flat
.
Anne
*NL*
did
not
know
this
,
but
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
realize
that
she
was
*NL*
in
a
dangerous
plight
.
At
this
rate
the
flat
would
fill
and
sink
long
*NL*
before
it
could
drift
to
the
lower
headland
.
Where
were
the
oars
?
Left
*NL*
behind
at
the
landing
!
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
gave
one
gasping
little
scream
which
nobody
ever
heard
;
she
was
*NL*
white
to
the
lips
,
but
she
did
not
lose
her
self-possession
.
There
was
*NL*
one
chance
--
just
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
horribly
frightened
,
''
she
told
Mrs.
Allan
the
next
day
,
``
and
it
*NL*
seemed
like
years
while
the
flat
was
drifting
down
to
the
bridge
and
the
*NL*
water
rising
in
it
every
moment
.
I
prayed
,
Mrs.
Allan
,
most
earnestly
,
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
shut
my
eyes
to
pray
,
for
I
knew
the
only
way
God
could
*NL*
save
me
was
to
let
the
flat
float
close
enough
to
one
of
the
bridge
*NL*
piles
for
me
to
climb
up
on
it
.
You
know
the
piles
are
just
old
tree
*NL*
trunks
and
there
are
lots
of
knots
and
old
branch
stubs
on
them
.
It
was
*NL*
proper
to
pray
,
but
I
had
to
do
my
part
by
watching
out
and
right
well
*NL*
I
knew
it
.
I
just
said
,
`
Dear
God
,
please
take
the
flat
close
to
a
pile
*NL*
and
I
'll
do
the
rest
,
'
over
and
over
again
.
Under
such
circumstances
you
*NL*
do
n't
think
much
about
making
a
flowery
prayer
.
But
mine
was
answered
,
*NL*
for
the
flat
bumped
right
into
a
pile
for
a
minute
and
I
flung
the
scarf
*NL*
and
the
shawl
over
my
shoulder
and
scrambled
up
on
a
big
providential
*NL*
stub
.
And
there
I
was
,
Mrs.
Allan
,
clinging
to
that
slippery
old
pile
*NL*
with
no
way
of
getting
up
or
down
.
It
was
a
very
unromantic
position
,
*NL*
but
I
did
n't
think
about
that
at
the
time
.
You
do
n't
think
much
about
*NL*
romance
when
you
have
just
escaped
from
a
watery
grave
.
I
said
a
*NL*
grateful
prayer
at
once
and
then
I
gave
all
my
attention
to
holding
on
*NL*
tight
,
for
I
knew
I
should
probably
have
to
depend
on
human
aid
to
get
*NL*
back
to
dry
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flat
drifted
under
the
bridge
and
then
promptly
sank
in
midstream
.
*NL*
Ruby
,
Jane
,
and
Diana
,
already
awaiting
it
on
the
lower
headland
,
saw
it
*NL*
disappear
before
their
very
eyes
and
had
not
a
doubt
but
that
Anne
*NL*
had
gone
down
with
it
.
For
a
moment
they
stood
still
,
white
as
sheets
,
*NL*
frozen
with
horror
at
the
tragedy
;
then
,
shrieking
at
the
tops
of
*NL*
their
voices
,
they
started
on
a
frantic
run
up
through
the
woods
,
never
*NL*
pausing
as
they
crossed
the
main
road
to
glance
the
way
of
the
bridge
.
*NL*
Anne
,
clinging
desperately
to
her
precarious
foothold
,
saw
their
flying
*NL*
forms
and
heard
their
shrieks
.
Help
would
soon
come
,
but
meanwhile
her
*NL*
position
was
a
very
uncomfortable
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
passed
by
,
each
seeming
an
hour
to
the
unfortunate
lily
*NL*
maid
.
Why
did
n't
somebody
come
?
Where
had
the
girls
gone
?
Suppose
they
*NL*
had
fainted
,
one
and
all
!
Suppose
nobody
ever
came
!
Suppose
she
grew
so
*NL*
tired
and
cramped
that
she
could
hold
on
no
longer
!
Anne
looked
at
the
*NL*
wicked
green
depths
below
her
,
wavering
with
long
,
oily
shadows
,
and
*NL*
shivered
.
Her
imagination
began
to
suggest
all
manner
of
gruesome
*NL*
possibilities
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
just
as
she
thought
she
really
could
not
endure
the
ache
in
her
*NL*
arms
and
wrists
another
moment
,
Gilbert
Blythe
came
rowing
under
the
*NL*
bridge
in
Harmon
Andrews
's
dory
!
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
glanced
up
and
,
much
to
his
amazement
,
beheld
a
little
white
*NL*
scornful
face
looking
down
upon
him
with
big
,
frightened
but
also
*NL*
scornful
gray
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
Shirley
!
How
on
earth
did
you
get
there
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
pulled
close
to
the
pile
and
extended
*NL*
his
hand
.
There
was
no
help
for
it
;
Anne
,
clinging
to
Gilbert
Blythe
's
*NL*
hand
,
scrambled
down
into
the
dory
,
where
she
sat
,
drabbled
and
furious
,
*NL*
in
the
stern
with
her
arms
full
of
dripping
shawl
and
wet
crepe
.
It
was
*NL*
certainly
extremely
difficult
to
be
dignified
under
the
circumstances
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
happened
,
Anne
?
''
asked
Gilbert
,
taking
up
his
oars
.
``
We
were
*NL*
playing
Elaine
''
explained
Anne
frigidly
,
without
even
looking
at
her
*NL*
rescuer
,
``
and
I
had
to
drift
down
to
Camelot
in
the
barge
--
I
mean
the
*NL*
flat
.
The
flat
began
to
leak
and
I
climbed
out
on
the
pile
.
The
girls
*NL*
went
for
help
.
Will
you
be
kind
enough
to
row
me
to
the
landing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
obligingly
rowed
to
the
landing
and
Anne
,
disdaining
assistance
,
*NL*
sprang
nimbly
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
she
said
haughtily
as
she
turned
away
.
*NL*
But
Gilbert
had
also
sprung
from
the
boat
and
now
laid
a
detaining
hand
*NL*
on
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
he
said
hurriedly
,
``
look
here
.
Ca
n't
we
be
good
friends
?
I
'm
*NL*
awfully
sorry
I
made
fun
of
your
hair
that
time
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
vex
*NL*
you
and
I
only
meant
it
for
a
joke
.
Besides
,
it
's
so
long
ago
.
I
think
*NL*
your
hair
is
awfully
pretty
now
--
honest
I
do
.
Let
's
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Anne
hesitated
.
She
had
an
odd
,
newly
awakened
*NL*
consciousness
under
all
her
outraged
dignity
that
the
half-shy
,
*NL*
half-eager
expression
in
Gilbert
's
hazel
eyes
was
something
that
was
*NL*
very
good
to
see
.
Her
heart
gave
a
quick
,
queer
little
beat
.
But
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
her
old
grievance
promptly
stiffened
up
her
wavering
*NL*
determination
.
That
scene
of
two
years
before
flashed
back
into
her
*NL*
recollection
as
vividly
as
if
it
had
taken
place
yesterday
.
Gilbert
had
*NL*
called
her
``
carrots
''
and
had
brought
about
her
disgrace
before
the
whole
*NL*
school
.
Her
resentment
,
which
to
other
and
older
people
might
be
as
*NL*
laughable
as
its
cause
,
was
in
no
whit
allayed
and
softened
by
time
*NL*
seemingly
.
She
hated
Gilbert
Blythe
!
She
would
never
forgive
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
coldly
,
``
I
shall
never
be
friends
with
you
,
Gilbert
*NL*
Blythe
;
and
I
do
n't
want
to
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
Gilbert
sprang
into
his
skiff
with
an
angry
color
in
his
*NL*
cheeks
.
``
I
'll
never
ask
you
to
be
friends
again
,
Anne
Shirley
.
And
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
either
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
away
with
swift
defiant
strokes
,
and
Anne
went
up
the
steep
,
*NL*
ferny
little
path
under
the
maples
.
She
held
her
head
very
high
,
but
*NL*
she
was
conscious
of
an
odd
feeling
of
regret
.
She
almost
wished
she
had
*NL*
answered
Gilbert
differently
.
Of
course
,
he
had
insulted
her
terribly
,
*NL*
but
still
--
!
Altogether
,
Anne
rather
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
to
*NL*
sit
down
and
have
a
good
cry
.
She
was
really
quite
unstrung
,
for
the
*NL*
reaction
from
her
fright
and
cramped
clinging
was
making
itself
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Halfway
up
the
path
she
met
Jane
and
Diana
rushing
back
to
the
pond
in
*NL*
a
state
narrowly
removed
from
positive
frenzy
.
They
had
found
nobody
at
*NL*
Orchard
Slope
,
both
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Barry
being
away
.
Here
Ruby
Gillis
had
*NL*
succumbed
to
hysterics
,
and
was
left
to
recover
from
them
as
best
she
*NL*
might
,
while
Jane
and
Diana
flew
through
the
Haunted
Wood
and
across
the
*NL*
brook
to
Green
Gables
.
There
they
had
found
nobody
either
,
for
Marilla
*NL*
had
gone
to
Carmody
and
Matthew
was
making
hay
in
the
back
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
''
gasped
Diana
,
fairly
falling
on
the
former
's
neck
*NL*
and
weeping
with
relief
and
delight
,
``
oh
,
Anne
--
we
thought
--
you
*NL*
were
--
drowned
--
and
we
felt
like
murderers
--
because
we
had
made
--
you
*NL*
be
--
Elaine
.
And
Ruby
is
in
hysterics
--
oh
,
Anne
,
how
did
you
escape
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
climbed
up
on
one
of
the
piles
,
''
explained
Anne
wearily
,
``
and
Gilbert
*NL*
Blythe
came
along
in
Mr.
Andrews
's
dory
and
brought
me
to
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
how
splendid
of
him
!
Why
,
it
's
so
romantic
!
''
said
Jane
,
*NL*
finding
breath
enough
for
utterance
at
last
.
``
Of
course
you
'll
speak
to
*NL*
him
after
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
wo
n't
,
''
flashed
Anne
,
with
a
momentary
return
of
her
old
*NL*
spirit
.
``
And
I
do
n't
want
ever
to
hear
the
word
`
romantic
'
again
,
Jane
*NL*
Andrews
.
I
'm
awfully
sorry
you
were
so
frightened
,
girls
.
It
is
all
my
*NL*
fault
.
I
feel
sure
I
was
born
under
an
unlucky
star
.
Everything
I
do
*NL*
gets
me
or
my
dearest
friends
into
a
scrape
.
We
've
gone
and
lost
your
*NL*
father
's
flat
,
Diana
,
and
I
have
a
presentiment
that
we
'll
not
be
*NL*
allowed
to
row
on
the
pond
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
presentiment
proved
more
trustworthy
than
presentiments
are
apt
*NL*
to
do
.
Great
was
the
consternation
in
the
Barry
and
Cuthbert
households
*NL*
when
the
events
of
the
afternoon
became
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
ever
have
any
sense
,
Anne
?
''
groaned
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
think
I
will
,
Marilla
,
''
returned
Anne
optimistically
.
A
good
*NL*
cry
,
indulged
in
the
grateful
solitude
of
the
east
gable
,
had
soothed
*NL*
her
nerves
and
restored
her
to
her
wonted
cheerfulness
.
``
I
think
my
*NL*
prospects
of
becoming
sensible
are
brighter
now
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
how
,
''
said
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
explained
Anne
,
``
I
've
learned
a
new
and
valuable
lesson
today
.
*NL*
Ever
since
I
came
to
Green
Gables
I
've
been
making
mistakes
,
and
each
*NL*
mistake
has
helped
to
cure
me
of
some
great
shortcoming
.
The
affair
of
*NL*
the
amethyst
brooch
cured
me
of
meddling
with
things
that
did
n't
belong
*NL*
to
me
.
The
Haunted
Wood
mistake
cured
me
of
letting
my
imagination
run
*NL*
away
with
me
.
The
liniment
cake
mistake
cured
me
of
carelessness
in
*NL*
cooking
.
Dyeing
my
hair
cured
me
of
vanity
.
I
never
think
about
my
hair
*NL*
and
nose
now
--
at
least
,
very
seldom
.
And
today
's
mistake
is
going
to
*NL*
cure
me
of
being
too
romantic
.
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
*NL*
no
use
trying
to
be
romantic
in
Avonlea
.
It
was
probably
easy
enough
in
*NL*
towered
Camelot
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
but
romance
is
not
appreciated
*NL*
now
.
I
feel
quite
sure
that
you
will
soon
see
a
great
improvement
in
me
*NL*
in
this
respect
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
hope
so
,
''
said
Marilla
skeptically
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Matthew
,
who
had
been
sitting
mutely
in
his
corner
,
laid
a
hand
on
*NL*
Anne
's
shoulder
when
Marilla
had
gone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
give
up
all
your
romance
,
Anne
,
''
he
whispered
shyly
,
``
a
little
*NL*
of
it
is
a
good
thing
--
not
too
much
,
of
course
--
but
keep
a
little
of
it
,
*NL*
Anne
,
keep
a
little
of
it
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
.
An
Epoch
in
Anne
's
Life
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
bringing
the
cows
home
from
the
back
pasture
by
way
of
Lover
's
*NL*
Lane
.
It
was
a
September
evening
and
all
the
gaps
and
clearings
in
the
*NL*
woods
were
brimmed
up
with
ruby
sunset
light
.
Here
and
there
the
lane
*NL*
was
splashed
with
it
,
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
already
quite
shadowy
*NL*
beneath
the
maples
,
and
the
spaces
under
the
firs
were
filled
with
a
*NL*
clear
violet
dusk
like
airy
wine
.
The
winds
were
out
in
their
tops
,
and
*NL*
there
is
no
sweeter
music
on
earth
than
that
which
the
wind
makes
in
the
*NL*
fir
trees
at
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cows
swung
placidly
down
the
lane
,
and
Anne
followed
them
dreamily
,
*NL*
repeating
aloud
the
battle
canto
from
MARMION
--
which
had
also
been
part
*NL*
of
their
English
course
the
preceding
winter
and
which
Miss
Stacy
had
*NL*
made
them
learn
off
by
heart
--
and
exulting
in
its
rushing
lines
and
the
*NL*
clash
of
spears
in
its
imagery
.
When
she
came
to
the
lines
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
stubborn
spearsmen
still
made
good
*NL*
Their
dark
impenetrable
wood
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
she
stopped
in
ecstasy
to
shut
her
eyes
that
she
might
the
better
fancy
*NL*
herself
one
of
that
heroic
ring
.
When
she
opened
them
again
it
was
to
*NL*
behold
Diana
coming
through
the
gate
that
led
into
the
Barry
field
and
*NL*
looking
so
important
that
Anne
instantly
divined
there
was
news
to
be
*NL*
told
.
But
betray
too
eager
curiosity
she
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
this
evening
just
like
a
purple
dream
,
Diana
?
It
makes
me
so
glad
*NL*
to
be
alive
.
In
the
mornings
I
always
think
the
mornings
are
best
;
but
*NL*
when
evening
comes
I
think
it
's
lovelier
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
very
fine
evening
,
''
said
Diana
,
``
but
oh
,
I
have
such
news
,
Anne
.
*NL*
Guess
.
You
can
have
three
guesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlotte
Gillis
is
going
to
be
married
in
the
church
after
all
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Allan
wants
us
to
decorate
it
,
''
cried
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Charlotte
's
beau
wo
n't
agree
to
that
,
because
nobody
ever
has
been
*NL*
married
in
the
church
yet
,
and
he
thinks
it
would
seem
too
much
like
a
*NL*
funeral
.
It
's
too
mean
,
because
it
would
be
such
fun
.
Guess
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jane
's
mother
is
going
to
let
her
have
a
birthday
party
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
shook
her
head
,
her
black
eyes
dancing
with
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
think
what
it
can
be
,
''
said
Anne
in
despair
,
``
unless
it
's
that
*NL*
Moody
Spurgeon
MacPherson
saw
you
home
from
prayer
meeting
last
night
.
*NL*
Did
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
not
,
''
exclaimed
Diana
indignantly
.
``
I
would
n't
be
likely
*NL*
to
boast
of
it
if
he
did
,
the
horrid
creature
!
I
knew
you
could
n't
guess
*NL*
it
.
Mother
had
a
letter
from
Aunt
Josephine
today
,
and
Aunt
Josephine
*NL*
wants
you
and
me
to
go
to
town
next
Tuesday
and
stop
with
her
for
the
*NL*
Exhibition
.
There
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
''
whispered
Anne
,
finding
it
necessary
to
lean
up
against
a
*NL*
maple
tree
for
support
,
``
do
you
really
mean
it
?
But
I
'm
afraid
Marilla
*NL*
wo
n't
let
me
go
.
She
will
say
that
she
ca
n't
encourage
gadding
about
.
*NL*
That
was
what
she
said
last
week
when
Jane
invited
me
to
go
with
them
*NL*
in
their
double-seated
buggy
to
the
American
concert
at
the
White
Sands
*NL*
Hotel
.
I
wanted
to
go
,
but
Marilla
said
I
'd
be
better
at
home
learning
*NL*
my
lessons
and
so
would
Jane
.
I
was
bitterly
disappointed
,
Diana
.
I
felt
*NL*
so
heartbroken
that
I
would
n't
say
my
prayers
when
I
went
to
bed
.
But
I
*NL*
repented
of
that
and
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
said
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Diana
,
``
we
'll
get
Mother
to
ask
Marilla
.
She
'll
be
*NL*
more
likely
to
let
you
go
then
;
and
if
she
does
we
'll
have
the
time
*NL*
of
our
lives
,
Anne
.
I
've
never
been
to
an
Exhibition
,
and
it
's
so
*NL*
aggravating
to
hear
the
other
girls
talking
about
their
trips
.
Jane
and
*NL*
Ruby
have
been
twice
,
and
they
're
going
this
year
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
to
think
about
it
at
all
until
I
know
whether
I
can
go
*NL*
or
not
,
''
said
Anne
resolutely
.
``
If
I
did
and
then
was
disappointed
,
it
*NL*
would
be
more
than
I
could
bear
.
But
in
case
I
do
go
I
'm
very
glad
my
*NL*
new
coat
will
be
ready
by
that
time
.
Marilla
did
n't
think
I
needed
a
new
*NL*
coat
.
She
said
my
old
one
would
do
very
well
for
another
winter
and
*NL*
that
I
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
having
a
new
dress
.
The
dress
is
very
*NL*
pretty
,
Diana
--
navy
blue
and
made
so
fashionably
.
Marilla
always
makes
*NL*
my
dresses
fashionably
now
,
because
she
says
she
does
n't
intend
to
have
*NL*
Matthew
going
to
Mrs.
Lynde
to
make
them
.
I
'm
so
glad
.
It
is
ever
so
*NL*
much
easier
to
be
good
if
your
clothes
are
fashionable
.
At
least
,
it
is
*NL*
easier
for
me
.
I
suppose
it
does
n't
make
such
a
difference
to
naturally
*NL*
good
people
.
But
Matthew
said
I
must
have
a
new
coat
,
so
Marilla
*NL*
bought
a
lovely
piece
of
blue
broadcloth
,
and
it
's
being
made
by
a
real
*NL*
dressmaker
over
at
Carmody
.
It
's
to
be
done
Saturday
night
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
trying
not
to
imagine
myself
walking
up
the
church
aisle
on
Sunday
in
*NL*
my
new
suit
and
cap
,
because
I
'm
afraid
it
is
n't
right
to
imagine
such
*NL*
things
.
But
it
just
slips
into
my
mind
in
spite
of
me
.
My
cap
is
so
*NL*
pretty
.
Matthew
bought
it
for
me
the
day
we
were
over
at
Carmody
.
It
is
*NL*
one
of
those
little
blue
velvet
ones
that
are
all
the
rage
,
with
gold
*NL*
cord
and
tassels
.
Your
new
hat
is
elegant
,
Diana
,
and
so
becoming
.
When
*NL*
I
saw
you
come
into
church
last
Sunday
my
heart
swelled
with
pride
to
*NL*
think
you
were
my
dearest
friend
.
Do
you
suppose
it
's
wrong
for
us
to
*NL*
think
so
much
about
our
clothes
?
Marilla
says
it
is
very
sinful
.
But
it
*NL*
is
such
an
interesting
subject
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
agreed
to
let
Anne
go
to
town
,
and
it
was
arranged
that
*NL*
Mr.
Barry
should
take
the
girls
in
on
the
following
Tuesday
.
As
*NL*
Charlottetown
was
thirty
miles
away
and
Mr.
Barry
wished
to
go
and
*NL*
return
the
same
day
,
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
very
early
start
.
But
*NL*
Anne
counted
it
all
joy
,
and
was
up
before
sunrise
on
Tuesday
morning
.
*NL*
A
glance
from
her
window
assured
her
that
the
day
would
be
fine
,
for
*NL*
the
eastern
sky
behind
the
firs
of
the
Haunted
Wood
was
all
silvery
*NL*
and
cloudless
.
Through
the
gap
in
the
trees
a
light
was
shining
in
the
*NL*
western
gable
of
Orchard
Slope
,
a
token
that
Diana
was
also
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
dressed
by
the
time
Matthew
had
the
fire
on
and
had
the
*NL*
breakfast
ready
when
Marilla
came
down
,
but
for
her
own
part
was
much
*NL*
too
excited
to
eat
.
After
breakfast
the
jaunty
new
cap
and
jacket
were
*NL*
donned
,
and
Anne
hastened
over
the
brook
and
up
through
the
firs
to
*NL*
Orchard
Slope
.
Mr.
Barry
and
Diana
were
waiting
for
her
,
and
they
were
*NL*
soon
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
drive
,
but
Anne
and
Diana
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
.
It
*NL*
was
delightful
to
rattle
along
over
the
moist
roads
in
the
early
red
*NL*
sunlight
that
was
creeping
across
the
shorn
harvest
fields
.
The
air
was
*NL*
fresh
and
crisp
,
and
little
smoke-blue
mists
curled
through
the
valleys
*NL*
and
floated
off
from
the
hills
.
Sometimes
the
road
went
through
woods
*NL*
where
maples
were
beginning
to
hang
out
scarlet
banners
;
sometimes
it
*NL*
crossed
rivers
on
bridges
that
made
Anne
's
flesh
cringe
with
the
old
,
*NL*
half-delightful
fear
;
sometimes
it
wound
along
a
harbor
shore
and
passed
*NL*
by
a
little
cluster
of
weather-gray
fishing
huts
;
again
it
mounted
to
*NL*
hills
whence
a
far
sweep
of
curving
upland
or
misty-blue
sky
could
be
*NL*
seen
;
but
wherever
it
went
there
was
much
of
interest
to
discuss
.
It
was
*NL*
almost
noon
when
they
reached
town
and
found
their
way
to
``
Beechwood
.
''
*NL*
It
was
quite
a
fine
old
mansion
,
set
back
from
the
street
in
a
seclusion
*NL*
of
green
elms
and
branching
beeches
.
Miss
Barry
met
them
at
the
door
*NL*
with
a
twinkle
in
her
sharp
black
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
come
to
see
me
at
last
,
you
Anne-girl
,
''
she
said
.
``
Mercy
,
*NL*
child
,
how
you
have
grown
!
You
're
taller
than
I
am
,
I
declare
.
And
*NL*
you
're
ever
so
much
better
looking
than
you
used
to
be
,
too
.
But
I
dare
*NL*
say
you
know
that
without
being
told
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
did
n't
,
''
said
Anne
radiantly
.
``
I
know
I
'm
not
so
freckled
as
*NL*
I
used
to
be
,
so
I
've
much
to
be
thankful
for
,
but
I
really
had
n't
dared
*NL*
to
hope
there
was
any
other
improvement
.
I
'm
so
glad
you
think
there
is
,
*NL*
Miss
Barry
.
''
Miss
Barry
's
house
was
furnished
with
``
great
magnificence
,
''
*NL*
as
Anne
told
Marilla
afterward
.
The
two
little
country
girls
were
rather
*NL*
abashed
by
the
splendor
of
the
parlor
where
Miss
Barry
left
them
when
*NL*
she
went
to
see
about
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
just
like
a
palace
?
''
whispered
Diana
.
``
I
never
was
in
Aunt
*NL*
Josephine
's
house
before
,
and
I
'd
no
idea
it
was
so
grand
.
I
just
wish
*NL*
Julia
Bell
could
see
this
--
she
puts
on
such
airs
about
her
mother
's
*NL*
parlor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Velvet
carpet
,
''
sighed
Anne
luxuriously
,
``
and
silk
curtains
!
I
've
*NL*
dreamed
of
such
things
,
Diana
.
But
do
you
know
I
do
n't
believe
I
feel
*NL*
very
comfortable
with
them
after
all
.
There
are
so
many
things
in
this
*NL*
room
and
all
so
splendid
that
there
is
no
scope
for
imagination
.
That
is
*NL*
one
consolation
when
you
are
poor
--
there
are
so
many
more
things
you
can
*NL*
imagine
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
sojourn
in
town
was
something
that
Anne
and
Diana
dated
from
for
*NL*
years
.
From
first
to
last
it
was
crowded
with
delights
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Wednesday
Miss
Barry
took
them
to
the
Exhibition
grounds
and
kept
*NL*
them
there
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
splendid
,
''
Anne
related
to
Marilla
later
on
.
``
I
never
imagined
*NL*
anything
so
interesting
.
I
do
n't
really
know
which
department
was
the
*NL*
most
interesting
.
I
think
I
liked
the
horses
and
the
flowers
and
the
*NL*
fancywork
best
.
Josie
Pye
took
first
prize
for
knitted
lace
.
I
was
*NL*
real
glad
she
did
.
And
I
was
glad
that
I
felt
glad
,
for
it
shows
I
'm
*NL*
improving
,
do
n't
you
think
,
Marilla
,
when
I
can
rejoice
in
Josie
's
*NL*
success
?
Mr.
Harmon
Andrews
took
second
prize
for
Gravenstein
apples
*NL*
and
Mr.
Bell
took
first
prize
for
a
pig
.
Diana
said
she
thought
it
was
*NL*
ridiculous
for
a
Sunday-school
superintendent
to
take
a
prize
in
pigs
,
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
see
why
.
Do
you
?
She
said
she
would
always
think
of
it
after
*NL*
this
when
he
was
praying
so
solemnly
.
Clara
Louise
MacPherson
took
a
*NL*
prize
for
painting
,
and
Mrs.
Lynde
got
first
prize
for
homemade
butter
*NL*
and
cheese
.
So
Avonlea
was
pretty
well
represented
,
was
n't
it
?
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
was
there
that
day
,
and
I
never
knew
how
much
I
really
liked
her
*NL*
until
I
saw
her
familiar
face
among
all
those
strangers
.
There
*NL*
were
thousands
of
people
there
,
Marilla
.
It
made
me
feel
dreadfully
*NL*
insignificant
.
And
Miss
Barry
took
us
up
to
the
grandstand
to
see
*NL*
the
horse
races
.
Mrs.
Lynde
would
n't
go
;
she
said
horse
racing
was
an
*NL*
abomination
and
,
she
being
a
church
member
,
thought
it
her
bounden
duty
*NL*
to
set
a
good
example
by
staying
away
.
But
there
were
so
many
there
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
Mrs.
Lynde
's
absence
would
ever
be
noticed
.
I
do
n't
think
,
*NL*
though
,
that
I
ought
to
go
very
often
to
horse
races
,
because
they
ARE
*NL*
awfully
fascinating
.
Diana
got
so
excited
that
she
offered
to
bet
me
*NL*
ten
cents
that
the
red
horse
would
win
.
I
did
n't
believe
he
would
,
but
*NL*
I
refused
to
bet
,
because
I
wanted
to
tell
Mrs.
Allan
all
about
*NL*
everything
,
and
I
felt
sure
it
would
n't
do
to
tell
her
that
.
It
's
always
*NL*
wrong
to
do
anything
you
ca
n't
tell
the
minister
's
wife
.
It
's
as
good
as
*NL*
an
extra
conscience
to
have
a
minister
's
wife
for
your
friend
.
And
I
was
*NL*
very
glad
I
did
n't
bet
,
because
the
red
horse
DID
win
,
and
I
would
have
*NL*
lost
ten
cents
.
So
you
see
that
virtue
was
its
own
reward
.
We
saw
a
man
*NL*
go
up
in
a
balloon
.
I
'd
love
to
go
up
in
a
balloon
,
Marilla
;
it
would
*NL*
be
simply
thrilling
;
and
we
saw
a
man
selling
fortunes
.
You
paid
him
ten
*NL*
cents
and
a
little
bird
picked
out
your
fortune
for
you
.
Miss
Barry
gave
*NL*
Diana
and
me
ten
cents
each
to
have
our
fortunes
told
.
Mine
was
that
I
*NL*
would
marry
a
dark-complected
man
who
was
very
wealthy
,
and
I
would
go
*NL*
across
water
to
live
.
I
looked
carefully
at
all
the
dark
men
I
saw
after
*NL*
that
,
but
I
did
n't
care
much
for
any
of
them
,
and
anyhow
I
suppose
*NL*
it
's
too
early
to
be
looking
out
for
him
yet
.
Oh
,
it
was
a
*NL*
never-to-be-forgotten
day
,
Marilla
.
I
was
so
tired
I
could
n't
sleep
at
*NL*
night
.
Miss
Barry
put
us
in
the
spare
room
,
according
to
promise
.
It
*NL*
was
an
elegant
room
,
Marilla
,
but
somehow
sleeping
in
a
spare
room
is
n't
*NL*
what
I
used
to
think
it
was
.
That
's
the
worst
of
growing
up
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
beginning
to
realize
it
.
The
things
you
wanted
so
much
when
you
were
a
*NL*
child
do
n't
seem
half
so
wonderful
to
you
when
you
get
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
the
girls
had
a
drive
in
the
park
,
and
in
the
evening
Miss
*NL*
Barry
took
them
to
a
concert
in
the
Academy
of
Music
,
where
a
noted
*NL*
prima
donna
was
to
sing
.
To
Anne
the
evening
was
a
glittering
vision
of
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
was
beyond
description
.
I
was
so
excited
I
could
n't
*NL*
even
talk
,
so
you
may
know
what
it
was
like
.
I
just
sat
in
enraptured
*NL*
silence
.
Madame
Selitsky
was
perfectly
beautiful
,
and
wore
white
satin
*NL*
and
diamonds
.
But
when
she
began
to
sing
I
never
thought
about
anything
*NL*
else
.
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
I
felt
.
But
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
could
*NL*
never
be
hard
to
be
good
any
more
.
I
felt
like
I
do
when
I
look
up
to
*NL*
the
stars
.
Tears
came
into
my
eyes
,
but
,
oh
,
they
were
such
happy
tears
.
*NL*
I
was
so
sorry
when
it
was
all
over
,
and
I
told
Miss
Barry
I
did
n't
see
*NL*
how
I
was
ever
to
return
to
common
life
again
.
She
said
she
thought
if
*NL*
we
went
over
to
the
restaurant
across
the
street
and
had
an
ice
cream
*NL*
it
might
help
me
.
That
sounded
so
prosaic
;
but
to
my
surprise
I
found
*NL*
it
true
.
The
ice
cream
was
delicious
,
Marilla
,
and
it
was
so
lovely
and
*NL*
dissipated
to
be
sitting
there
eating
it
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
.
*NL*
Diana
said
she
believed
she
was
born
for
city
life
.
Miss
Barry
asked
*NL*
me
what
my
opinion
was
,
but
I
said
I
would
have
to
think
it
over
very
*NL*
seriously
before
I
could
tell
her
what
I
really
thought
.
So
I
thought
it
*NL*
over
after
I
went
to
bed
.
That
is
the
best
time
to
think
things
out
.
And
*NL*
I
came
to
the
conclusion
,
Marilla
,
that
I
was
n't
born
for
city
life
and
*NL*
that
I
was
glad
of
it
.
It
's
nice
to
be
eating
ice
cream
at
brilliant
*NL*
restaurants
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
once
in
a
while
;
but
as
a
regular
*NL*
thing
I
'd
rather
be
in
the
east
gable
at
eleven
,
sound
asleep
,
but
kind
*NL*
of
knowing
even
in
my
sleep
that
the
stars
were
shining
outside
and
that
*NL*
the
wind
was
blowing
in
the
firs
across
the
brook
.
I
told
Miss
Barry
*NL*
so
at
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
she
laughed
.
Miss
Barry
generally
*NL*
laughed
at
anything
I
said
,
even
when
I
said
the
most
solemn
things
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
I
liked
it
,
Marilla
,
because
I
was
n't
trying
to
be
funny
.
*NL*
But
she
is
a
most
hospitable
lady
and
treated
us
royally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
brought
going-home
time
,
and
Mr.
Barry
drove
in
for
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
you
've
enjoyed
yourselves
,
''
said
Miss
Barry
,
as
she
bade
*NL*
them
good-bye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
we
have
,
''
said
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Anne-girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
enjoyed
every
minute
of
the
time
,
''
said
Anne
,
throwing
her
arms
*NL*
impulsively
about
the
old
woman
's
neck
and
kissing
her
wrinkled
cheek
.
*NL*
Diana
would
never
have
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
and
felt
rather
aghast
*NL*
at
Anne
's
freedom
.
But
Miss
Barry
was
pleased
,
and
she
stood
on
her
*NL*
veranda
and
watched
the
buggy
out
of
sight
.
Then
she
went
back
into
her
*NL*
big
house
with
a
sigh
.
It
seemed
very
lonely
,
lacking
those
fresh
young
*NL*
lives
.
Miss
Barry
was
a
rather
selfish
old
lady
,
if
the
truth
must
*NL*
be
told
,
and
had
never
cared
much
for
anybody
but
herself
.
She
valued
*NL*
people
only
as
they
were
of
service
to
her
or
amused
her
.
Anne
had
*NL*
amused
her
,
and
consequently
stood
high
in
the
old
lady
's
good
graces
.
*NL*
But
Miss
Barry
found
herself
thinking
less
about
Anne
's
quaint
speeches
*NL*
than
of
her
fresh
enthusiasms
,
her
transparent
emotions
,
her
little
*NL*
winning
ways
,
and
the
sweetness
of
her
eyes
and
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
Marilla
Cuthbert
was
an
old
fool
when
I
heard
she
'd
adopted
*NL*
a
girl
out
of
an
orphan
asylum
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
but
I
guess
she
*NL*
did
n't
make
much
of
a
mistake
after
all
.
If
I
'd
a
child
like
Anne
in
the
*NL*
house
all
the
time
I
'd
be
a
better
and
happier
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
Diana
found
the
drive
home
as
pleasant
as
the
drive
*NL*
in
--
pleasanter
,
indeed
,
since
there
was
the
delightful
consciousness
of
*NL*
home
waiting
at
the
end
of
it
.
It
was
sunset
when
they
passed
through
*NL*
White
Sands
and
turned
into
the
shore
road
.
Beyond
,
the
Avonlea
hills
*NL*
came
out
darkly
against
the
saffron
sky
.
Behind
them
the
moon
was
rising
*NL*
out
of
the
sea
that
grew
all
radiant
and
transfigured
in
her
light
.
*NL*
Every
little
cove
along
the
curving
road
was
a
marvel
of
dancing
*NL*
ripples
.
The
waves
broke
with
a
soft
swish
on
the
rocks
below
them
,
and
*NL*
the
tang
of
the
sea
was
in
the
strong
,
fresh
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
it
's
good
to
be
alive
and
to
be
going
home
,
''
breathed
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
crossed
the
log
bridge
over
the
brook
the
kitchen
light
of
*NL*
Green
Gables
winked
her
a
friendly
welcome
back
,
and
through
the
open
*NL*
door
shone
the
hearth
fire
,
sending
out
its
warm
red
glow
athwart
the
*NL*
chilly
autumn
night
.
Anne
ran
blithely
up
the
hill
and
into
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
where
a
hot
supper
was
waiting
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
've
got
back
?
''
said
Marilla
,
folding
up
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
oh
,
it
's
so
good
to
be
back
,
''
said
Anne
joyously
.
``
I
could
*NL*
kiss
everything
,
even
to
the
clock
.
Marilla
,
a
broiled
chicken
!
You
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
cooked
that
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
I
thought
you
'd
be
hungry
after
such
*NL*
a
drive
and
need
something
real
appetizing
.
Hurry
and
take
off
your
*NL*
things
,
and
we
'll
have
supper
as
soon
as
Matthew
comes
in
.
I
'm
glad
*NL*
you
've
got
back
,
I
must
say
.
It
's
been
fearful
lonesome
here
without
*NL*
you
,
and
I
never
put
in
four
longer
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
Anne
sat
before
the
fire
between
Matthew
and
Marilla
,
and
*NL*
gave
them
a
full
account
of
her
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
a
splendid
time
,
''
she
concluded
happily
,
``
and
I
feel
that
it
*NL*
marks
an
epoch
in
my
life
.
But
the
best
of
it
all
was
the
coming
home

CHAPTER
XXX
.
The
Queens
Class
Is
Organized
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
laid
her
knitting
on
her
lap
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
were
tired
,
and
she
thought
vaguely
that
she
must
see
about
having
*NL*
her
glasses
changed
the
next
time
she
went
to
town
,
for
her
eyes
had
*NL*
grown
tired
very
often
of
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
dark
,
for
the
full
November
twilight
had
fallen
around
*NL*
Green
Gables
,
and
the
only
light
in
the
kitchen
came
from
the
dancing
*NL*
red
flames
in
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
curled
up
Turk-fashion
on
the
hearthrug
,
gazing
into
that
*NL*
joyous
glow
where
the
sunshine
of
a
hundred
summers
was
being
distilled
*NL*
from
the
maple
cordwood
.
She
had
been
reading
,
but
her
book
had
slipped
*NL*
to
the
floor
,
and
now
she
was
dreaming
,
with
a
smile
on
her
parted
lips
.
*NL*
Glittering
castles
in
Spain
were
shaping
themselves
out
of
the
mists
and
*NL*
rainbows
of
her
lively
fancy
;
adventures
wonderful
and
enthralling
*NL*
were
happening
to
her
in
cloudland
--
adventures
that
always
turned
out
*NL*
triumphantly
and
never
involved
her
in
scrapes
like
those
of
actual
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
at
her
with
a
tenderness
that
would
never
have
been
*NL*
suffered
to
reveal
itself
in
any
clearer
light
than
that
soft
mingling
*NL*
of
fireshine
and
shadow
.
The
lesson
of
a
love
that
should
display
itself
*NL*
easily
in
spoken
word
and
open
look
was
one
Marilla
could
never
learn
.
*NL*
But
she
had
learned
to
love
this
slim
,
gray-eyed
girl
with
an
affection
*NL*
all
the
deeper
and
stronger
from
its
very
undemonstrativeness
.
Her
love
*NL*
made
her
afraid
of
being
unduly
indulgent
,
indeed
.
She
had
an
uneasy
*NL*
feeling
that
it
was
rather
sinful
to
set
one
's
heart
so
intensely
on
any
*NL*
human
creature
as
she
had
set
hers
on
Anne
,
and
perhaps
she
performed
a
*NL*
sort
of
unconscious
penance
for
this
by
being
stricter
and
more
critical
*NL*
than
if
the
girl
had
been
less
dear
to
her
.
Certainly
Anne
herself
had
*NL*
no
idea
how
Marilla
loved
her
.
She
sometimes
thought
wistfully
that
*NL*
Marilla
was
very
hard
to
please
and
distinctly
lacking
in
sympathy
*NL*
and
understanding
.
But
she
always
checked
the
thought
reproachfully
,
*NL*
remembering
what
she
owed
to
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
abruptly
,
``
Miss
Stacy
was
here
this
afternoon
when
*NL*
you
were
out
with
Diana
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
came
back
from
her
other
world
with
a
start
and
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
?
Oh
,
I
'm
so
sorry
I
was
n't
in
.
Why
did
n't
you
call
me
,
Marilla
?
*NL*
Diana
and
I
were
only
over
in
the
Haunted
Wood
.
It
's
lovely
in
the
woods
*NL*
now
.
All
the
little
wood
things
--
the
ferns
and
the
satin
leaves
and
the
*NL*
crackerberries
--
have
gone
to
sleep
,
just
as
if
somebody
had
tucked
them
*NL*
away
until
spring
under
a
blanket
of
leaves
.
I
think
it
was
a
little
*NL*
gray
fairy
with
a
rainbow
scarf
that
came
tiptoeing
along
the
last
*NL*
moonlight
night
and
did
it
.
Diana
would
n't
say
much
about
that
,
though
.
*NL*
Diana
has
never
forgotten
the
scolding
her
mother
gave
her
about
*NL*
imagining
ghosts
into
the
Haunted
Wood
.
It
had
a
very
bad
effect
on
*NL*
Diana
's
imagination
.
It
blighted
it
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
Myrtle
Bell
is
a
*NL*
blighted
being
.
I
asked
Ruby
Gillis
why
Myrtle
was
blighted
,
and
Ruby
*NL*
said
she
guessed
it
was
because
her
young
man
had
gone
back
on
her
.
Ruby
*NL*
Gillis
thinks
of
nothing
but
young
men
,
and
the
older
she
gets
the
worse
*NL*
she
is
.
Young
men
are
all
very
well
in
their
place
,
but
it
does
n't
do
to
*NL*
drag
them
into
everything
,
does
it
?
Diana
and
I
are
thinking
seriously
*NL*
of
promising
each
other
that
we
will
never
marry
but
be
nice
old
maids
*NL*
and
live
together
forever
.
Diana
has
n't
quite
made
up
her
mind
though
,
*NL*
because
she
thinks
perhaps
it
would
be
nobler
to
marry
some
wild
,
*NL*
dashing
,
wicked
young
man
and
reform
him
.
Diana
and
I
talk
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
serious
subjects
now
,
you
know
.
We
feel
that
we
are
so
much
older
*NL*
than
we
used
to
be
that
it
is
n't
becoming
to
talk
of
childish
matters
.
*NL*
It
's
such
a
solemn
thing
to
be
almost
fourteen
,
Marilla
.
Miss
Stacy
took
*NL*
all
us
girls
who
are
in
our
teens
down
to
the
brook
last
Wednesday
,
and
*NL*
talked
to
us
about
it
.
She
said
we
could
n't
be
too
careful
what
habits
*NL*
we
formed
and
what
ideals
we
acquired
in
our
teens
,
because
by
the
time
*NL*
we
were
twenty
our
characters
would
be
developed
and
the
foundation
laid
*NL*
for
our
whole
future
life
.
And
she
said
if
the
foundation
was
shaky
we
*NL*
could
never
build
anything
really
worth
while
on
it
.
Diana
and
I
talked
*NL*
the
matter
over
coming
home
from
school
.
We
felt
extremely
solemn
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
And
we
decided
that
we
would
try
to
be
very
careful
indeed
and
*NL*
form
respectable
habits
and
learn
all
we
could
and
be
as
sensible
as
*NL*
possible
,
so
that
by
the
time
we
were
twenty
our
characters
would
be
*NL*
properly
developed
.
It
's
perfectly
appalling
to
think
of
being
twenty
,
*NL*
Marilla
.
It
sounds
so
fearfully
old
and
grown
up
.
But
why
was
Miss
Stacy
*NL*
here
this
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
want
to
tell
you
,
Anne
,
if
you
'll
ever
give
me
a
chance
*NL*
to
get
a
word
in
edgewise
.
She
was
talking
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
me
?
''
Anne
looked
rather
scared
.
Then
she
flushed
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
what
she
was
saying
.
I
meant
to
tell
you
,
Marilla
,
honestly
*NL*
I
did
,
but
I
forgot
.
Miss
Stacy
caught
me
reading
Ben
Hur
in
school
*NL*
yesterday
afternoon
when
I
should
have
been
studying
my
Canadian
*NL*
history
.
Jane
Andrews
lent
it
to
me
.
I
was
reading
it
at
dinner
hour
,
*NL*
and
I
had
just
got
to
the
chariot
race
when
school
went
in
.
I
was
simply
*NL*
wild
to
know
how
it
turned
out
--
although
I
felt
sure
Ben
Hur
must
win
,
*NL*
because
it
would
n't
be
poetical
justice
if
he
did
n't
--
so
I
spread
the
*NL*
history
open
on
my
desk
lid
and
then
tucked
Ben
Hur
between
the
desk
and
*NL*
my
knee
.
I
just
looked
as
if
I
were
studying
Canadian
history
,
you
know
,
*NL*
while
all
the
while
I
was
reveling
in
Ben
Hur
.
I
was
so
interested
in
it
*NL*
that
I
never
noticed
Miss
Stacy
coming
down
the
aisle
until
all
at
*NL*
once
I
just
looked
up
and
there
she
was
looking
down
at
me
,
so
*NL*
reproachful-like
.
I
ca
n't
tell
you
how
ashamed
I
felt
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
especially
when
I
heard
Josie
Pye
giggling
.
Miss
Stacy
took
Ben
Hur
*NL*
away
,
but
she
never
said
a
word
then
.
She
kept
me
in
at
recess
and
*NL*
talked
to
me
.
She
said
I
had
done
very
wrong
in
two
respects
.
First
,
I
*NL*
was
wasting
the
time
I
ought
to
have
put
on
my
studies
;
and
secondly
,
*NL*
I
was
deceiving
my
teacher
in
trying
to
make
it
appear
I
was
reading
a
*NL*
history
when
it
was
a
storybook
instead
.
I
had
never
realized
until
that
*NL*
moment
,
Marilla
,
that
what
I
was
doing
was
deceitful
.
I
was
shocked
.
I
*NL*
cried
bitterly
,
and
asked
Miss
Stacy
to
forgive
me
and
I
'd
never
do
such
*NL*
a
thing
again
;
and
I
offered
to
do
penance
by
never
so
much
as
looking
*NL*
at
Ben
Hur
for
a
whole
week
,
not
even
to
see
how
the
chariot
race
turned
*NL*
out
.
But
Miss
Stacy
said
she
would
n't
require
that
,
and
she
forgave
me
*NL*
freely
.
So
I
think
it
was
n't
very
kind
of
her
to
come
up
here
to
you
*NL*
about
it
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Stacy
never
mentioned
such
a
thing
to
me
,
Anne
,
and
its
only
your
*NL*
guilty
conscience
that
's
the
matter
with
you
.
You
have
no
business
to
be
*NL*
taking
storybooks
to
school
.
You
read
too
many
novels
anyhow
.
When
I
was
*NL*
a
girl
I
was
n't
so
much
as
allowed
to
look
at
a
novel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
can
you
call
Ben
Hur
a
novel
when
it
's
really
such
a
religious
*NL*
book
?
''
protested
Anne
.
``
Of
course
it
's
a
little
too
exciting
to
be
*NL*
proper
reading
for
Sunday
,
and
I
only
read
it
on
weekdays
.
And
I
never
*NL*
read
ANY
book
now
unless
either
Miss
Stacy
or
Mrs.
Allan
thinks
it
is
a
*NL*
proper
book
for
a
girl
thirteen
and
three-quarters
to
read
.
Miss
Stacy
*NL*
made
me
promise
that
.
She
found
me
reading
a
book
one
day
called
,
The
*NL*
Lurid
Mystery
of
the
Haunted
Hall
.
It
was
one
Ruby
Gillis
had
lent
me
,
*NL*
and
,
oh
,
Marilla
,
it
was
so
fascinating
and
creepy
.
It
just
curdled
the
*NL*
blood
in
my
veins
.
But
Miss
Stacy
said
it
was
a
very
silly
,
unwholesome
*NL*
book
,
and
she
asked
me
not
to
read
any
more
of
it
or
any
like
it
.
I
*NL*
did
n't
mind
promising
not
to
read
any
more
like
it
,
but
it
was
AGONIZING
*NL*
to
give
back
that
book
without
knowing
how
it
turned
out
.
But
my
love
*NL*
for
Miss
Stacy
stood
the
test
and
I
did
.
It
's
really
wonderful
,
Marilla
,
*NL*
what
you
can
do
when
you
're
truly
anxious
to
please
a
certain
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
I
'll
light
the
lamp
and
get
to
work
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
I
*NL*
see
plainly
that
you
do
n't
want
to
hear
what
Miss
Stacy
had
to
say
.
*NL*
You
're
more
interested
in
the
sound
of
your
own
tongue
than
in
anything
*NL*
else

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
Marilla
,
I
do
want
to
hear
it
,
''
cried
Anne
contritely
.
``
I
*NL*
wo
n't
say
another
word

not
one

I
know
I
talk
too
much
,
but
I
am
really
*NL*
trying
to
overcome
it
,
and
although
I
say
far
too
much
,
yet
if
you
only
*NL*
knew
how
many
things
I
want
to
say
and
do
n't
,
you
'd
give
me
some
credit

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Miss
Stacy
wants
to
organize
a
class
among
her
advanced
students

who
mean
to
study
for

entrance
examination
into
Queen
's
.
She
intends
*NL*
to
give
them
extra
lessons
for
an
hour
after
school

And
she
came
to
ask
*NL*
Matthew
and
me
if
we
would
like
to
have
you
join
it

What
do
you
think
*NL*
about
it
yourself

Would
you
like

go

Queen
's
and
pass
for
a

teacher

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
!
''
Anne
straightened
to
her
knees
and
clasped
her
hands
.
*NL*
``
It
's
been
the
dream
of
my
life
--
that
is
,
for
the
last
six
months
,
ever
*NL*
since
Ruby
and
Jane
began
to
talk
of
studying
for
the
Entrance
.
But
I
*NL*
did
n't
say
anything
about
it
,
because
I
supposed
it
would
be
perfectly
*NL*
useless
.
I
'd
love
to
be
a
teacher
.
But
wo
n't
it
be
dreadfully
expensive
?
*NL*
Mr.
Andrews
says
it
cost
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
to
put
Prissy
*NL*
through
,
and
Prissy
was
n't
a
dunce
in
geometry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
need
n't
worry
about
that
part
of
it

When
Matthew
and
I
*NL*
took
you
to
bring
up
we
resolved
we
would
do
the
best
we
could
for
you
*NL*
and
give
you
a
good
education

I
believe
in
a
girl
being
fitted
to
earn
*NL*
her
own
living
whether
she
ever
has
to

not

You
'll
always
have
a
home

at
Green
Gables
as
long
as
Matthew

I
are
here

but
nobody
knows
what

is
going
to
happen
in
this
uncertain
world

it
's
just
as
well
to
be

you

Marilla
,
thank
you
.
''
Anne
flung
her
arms
about
Marilla
's
waist
and
*NL*
looked
up
earnestly
into
her
face
.
``
I
'm
extremely
grateful
to
you
and
*NL*
Matthew
.
And
I
'll
study
as
hard
as
I
can
and
do
my
very
best
to
be
a
*NL*
credit
to
you
.
I
warn
you
not
to
expect
much
in
geometry
,
but
I
think
I
*NL*
can
hold
my
own
in
anything
else
if
I
work
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
you
'll
get
along
well
enough
.
Miss
Stacy
says
you
are
bright
*NL*
and
diligent
.
''
Not
for
worlds
would
Marilla
have
told
Anne
just
what
*NL*
Miss
Stacy
had
said
about
her
;
that
would
have
been
to
pamper
vanity
.
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
rush
to
any
extreme
of
killing
yourself
over
your
books
.
*NL*
There
is
no
hurry
.
You
wo
n't
be
ready
to
try
the
Entrance
for
a
year
and
*NL*
a
half
yet
.
But
it
's
well
to
begin
in
time
and
be
thoroughly
grounded
,
*NL*
Miss
Stacy
says
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
take
more
interest
than
ever
in
my
studies
now
,
''
said
Anne
*NL*
blissfully
,
``
because
I
have
a
purpose
in
life
.
Mr.
Allan
says
everybody
*NL*
should
have
a
purpose
in
life
and
pursue
it
faithfully
.
Only
he
says
*NL*
we
must
first
make
sure
that
it
is
a
worthy
purpose
.
I
would
call
it
a
*NL*
worthy
purpose
to
want
to
be
a
teacher
like
Miss
Stacy
,
would
n't
you
,
*NL*
Marilla
?
I
think
it
's
a
very
noble
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Queen
's
class
was
organized
in
due
time
.
Gilbert
Blythe
,
Anne
*NL*
Shirley
,
Ruby
Gillis
,
Jane
Andrews
,
Josie
Pye
,
Charlie
Sloane
,
and
Moody
*NL*
Spurgeon
MacPherson
joined
it
.
Diana
Barry
did
not
,
as
her
parents
*NL*
did
not
intend
to
send
her
to
Queen
's
.
This
seemed
nothing
short
of
a
*NL*
calamity
to
Anne
.
Never
,
since
the
night
on
which
Minnie
May
had
had
the
*NL*
croup
,
had
she
and
Diana
been
separated
in
anything
.
On
the
evening
when
*NL*
the
Queen
's
class
first
remained
in
school
for
the
extra
lessons
and
*NL*
Anne
saw
Diana
go
slowly
out
with
the
others
,
to
walk
home
alone
through
*NL*
the
Birch
Path
and
Violet
Vale
,
it
was
all
the
former
could
do
to
keep
*NL*
her
seat
and
refrain
from
rushing
impulsively
after
her
chum
.
A
lump
*NL*
came
into
her
throat
,
and
she
hastily
retired
behind
the
pages
of
her
*NL*
uplifted
Latin
grammar
to
hide
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
Not
for
worlds
*NL*
would
Anne
have
had
Gilbert
Blythe
or
Josie
Pye
see
those
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
oh
,
Marilla
,
I
really
felt
that
I
had
tasted
the
bitterness
of
*NL*
death
,
as
Mr.
Allan
said
in
his
sermon
last
Sunday
,
when
I
saw
Diana
go
*NL*
out
alone
,
''
she
said
mournfully
that
night
.
``
I
thought
how
splendid
it
*NL*
would
have
been
if
Diana
had
only
been
going
to
study
for
the
Entrance
,
*NL*
too
.
But
we
ca
n't
have
things
perfect
in
this
imperfect
world
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
says
.
Mrs.
Lynde
is
n't
exactly
a
comforting
person
sometimes
,
but
*NL*
there
's
no
doubt
she
says
a
great
many
very
true
things
.
And
I
think
the
*NL*
Queen
's
class
is
going
to
be
extremely
interesting
.
Jane
and
Ruby
*NL*
are
just
going
to
study
to
be
teachers
.
That
is
the
height
of
their
*NL*
ambition
.
Ruby
says
she
will
only
teach
for
two
years
after
she
gets
*NL*
through
,
and
then
she
intends
to
be
married
.
Jane
says
she
will
devote
*NL*
her
whole
life
to
teaching
,
and
never
,
never
marry
,
because
you
are
paid
*NL*
a
salary
for
teaching
,
but
a
husband
wo
n't
pay
you
anything
,
and
growls
*NL*
if
you
ask
for
a
share
in
the
egg
and
butter
money
.
I
expect
Jane
speaks
*NL*
from
mournful
experience
,
for
Mrs.
Lynde
says
that
her
father
is
a
*NL*
perfect
old
crank
,
and
meaner
than
second
skimmings
.
Josie
Pye
says
she
*NL*
is
just
going
to
college
for
education
's
sake
,
because
she
wo
n't
have
to
*NL*
earn
her
own
living
;
she
says
of
course
it
is
different
with
orphans
who
*NL*
are
living
on
charity
--
THEY
have
to
hustle
.
Moody
Spurgeon
is
going
to
*NL*
be
a
minister
.
Mrs.
Lynde
says
he
could
n't
be
anything
else
with
a
name
*NL*
like
that
to
live
up
to
.
I
hope
it
is
n't
wicked
of
me
,
Marilla
,
but
*NL*
really
the
thought
of
Moody
Spurgeon
being
a
minister
makes
me
laugh
.
*NL*
He
's
such
a
funny-looking
boy
with
that
big
fat
face
,
and
his
little
*NL*
blue
eyes
,
and
his
ears
sticking
out
like
flaps
.
But
perhaps
he
will
*NL*
be
more
intellectual
looking
when
he
grows
up
.
Charlie
Sloane
says
he
's
*NL*
going
to
go
into
politics
and
be
a
member
of
Parliament
,
but
Mrs.
Lynde
*NL*
says
he
'll
never
succeed
at
that
,
because
the
Sloanes
are
all
honest
*NL*
people
,
and
it
's
only
rascals
that
get
on
in
politics
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
Gilbert
Blythe
going
to
be
?
''
queried
Marilla
,
seeing
that
Anne
*NL*
was
opening
her
Caesar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
happen
to
know
what
Gilbert
Blythe
's
ambition
in
life
is
--
if
he
*NL*
has
any
,
''
said
Anne
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
open
rivalry
between
Gilbert
and
Anne
now
.
Previously
the
*NL*
rivalry
had
been
rather
onesided
,
but
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
that
*NL*
Gilbert
was
as
determined
to
be
first
in
class
as
Anne
was
.
He
was
*NL*
a
foeman
worthy
of
her
steel
.
The
other
members
of
the
class
tacitly
*NL*
acknowledged
their
superiority
,
and
never
dreamed
of
trying
to
compete
*NL*
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
day
by
the
pond
when
she
had
refused
to
listen
to
his
plea
*NL*
for
forgiveness
,
Gilbert
,
save
for
the
aforesaid
determined
rivalry
,
*NL*
had
evinced
no
recognition
whatever
of
the
existence
of
Anne
Shirley
.
He
*NL*
talked
and
jested
with
the
other
girls
,
exchanged
books
and
puzzles
with
*NL*
them
,
discussed
lessons
and
plans
,
sometimes
walked
home
with
one
or
the
*NL*
other
of
them
from
prayer
meeting
or
Debating
Club
.
But
Anne
Shirley
*NL*
he
simply
ignored
,
and
Anne
found
out
that
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
*NL*
ignored
.
It
was
in
vain
that
she
told
herself
with
a
toss
of
her
head
*NL*
that
she
did
not
care
.
Deep
down
in
her
wayward
,
feminine
little
heart
*NL*
she
knew
that
she
did
care
,
and
that
if
she
had
that
chance
of
the
Lake
*NL*
of
Shining
Waters
again
she
would
answer
very
differently
.
All
at
*NL*
once
,
as
it
seemed
,
and
to
her
secret
dismay
,
she
found
that
the
old
*NL*
resentment
she
had
cherished
against
him
was
gone
--
gone
just
when
she
*NL*
most
needed
its
sustaining
power
.
It
was
in
vain
that
she
recalled
every
*NL*
incident
and
emotion
of
that
memorable
occasion
and
tried
to
feel
*NL*
the
old
satisfying
anger
.
That
day
by
the
pond
had
witnessed
its
last
*NL*
spasmodic
flicker
.
Anne
realized
that
she
had
forgiven
and
forgotten
*NL*
without
knowing
it
.
But
it
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
least
neither
Gilbert
nor
anybody
else
,
not
even
Diana
,
should
*NL*
ever
suspect
how
sorry
she
was
and
how
much
she
wished
she
had
n't
been
*NL*
so
proud
and
horrid
!
She
determined
to
``
shroud
her
feelings
in
deepest
*NL*
oblivion
,
''
and
it
may
be
stated
here
and
now
that
she
did
it
,
so
*NL*
successfully
that
Gilbert
,
who
possibly
was
not
quite
so
indifferent
as
*NL*
he
seemed
,
could
not
console
himself
with
any
belief
that
Anne
felt
his
*NL*
retaliatory
scorn
.
The
only
poor
comfort
he
had
was
that
she
snubbed
*NL*
Charlie
Sloane
,
unmercifully
,
continually
,
and
undeservedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Otherwise
the
winter
passed
away
in
a
round
of
pleasant
duties
and
*NL*
studies
.
For
Anne
the
days
slipped
by
like
golden
beads
on
the
necklace
*NL*
of
the
year
.
She
was
happy
,
eager
,
interested
;
there
were
lessons
to
be
*NL*
learned
and
honor
to
be
won
;
delightful
books
to
read
;
new
pieces
to
be
*NL*
practiced
for
the
Sunday-school
choir
;
pleasant
Saturday
afternoons
at
*NL*
the
manse
with
Mrs.
Allan
;
and
then
,
almost
before
Anne
realized
it
,
*NL*
spring
had
come
again
to
Green
Gables
and
all
the
world
was
abloom
once
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Studies
palled
just
a
wee
bit
then
;
the
Queen
's
class
,
left
behind
in
*NL*
school
while
the
others
scattered
to
green
lanes
and
leafy
wood
cuts
and
*NL*
meadow
byways
,
looked
wistfully
out
of
the
windows
and
discovered
that
*NL*
Latin
verbs
and
French
exercises
had
somehow
lost
the
tang
and
zest
they
*NL*
had
possessed
in
the
crisp
winter
months
.
Even
Anne
and
Gilbert
lagged
*NL*
and
grew
indifferent
.
Teacher
and
taught
were
alike
glad
when
the
term
*NL*
was
ended
and
the
glad
vacation
days
stretched
rosily
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
done
good
work
this
past
year
,
''
Miss
Stacy
told
them
on
the
*NL*
last
evening
,
``
and
you
deserve
a
good
,
jolly
vacation
.
Have
the
best
*NL*
time
you
can
in
the
out-of-door
world
and
lay
in
a
good
stock
of
health
*NL*
and
vitality
and
ambition
to
carry
you
through
next
year
.
It
will
be
the
*NL*
tug
of
war
,
you
know
--
the
last
year
before
the
Entrance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
be
back
next
year
,
Miss
Stacy
?
''
asked
Josie
Pye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Josie
Pye
never
scrupled
to
ask
questions
;
in
this
instance
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
class
felt
grateful
to
her
;
none
of
them
would
have
dared
to
ask
*NL*
it
of
Miss
Stacy
,
but
all
wanted
to
,
for
there
had
been
alarming
rumors
*NL*
running
at
large
through
the
school
for
some
time
that
Miss
Stacy
was
*NL*
not
coming
back
the
next
year
--
that
she
had
been
offered
a
position
*NL*
in
the
grade
school
of
her
own
home
district
and
meant
to
accept
.
The
*NL*
Queen
's
class
listened
in
breathless
suspense
for
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
I
will
,
''
said
Miss
Stacy
.
``
I
thought
of
taking
another
*NL*
school
,
but
I
have
decided
to
come
back
to
Avonlea
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
*NL*
I
've
grown
so
interested
in
my
pupils
here
that
I
found
I
could
n't
leave
*NL*
them
.
So
I
'll
stay
and
see
you
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
said
Moody
Spurgeon
.
Moody
Spurgeon
had
never
been
so
carried
*NL*
away
by
his
feelings
before
,
and
he
blushed
uncomfortably
every
time
he
*NL*
thought
about
it
for
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
,
''
said
Anne
,
with
shining
eyes
.
``
Dear
Stacy
,
it
would
*NL*
be
perfectly
dreadful
if
you
did
n't
come
back
.
I
do
n't
believe
I
could
*NL*
have
the
heart
to
go
on
with
my
studies
at
all
if
another
teacher
came
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Anne
got
home
that
night
she
stacked
all
her
textbooks
away
in
an
*NL*
old
trunk
in
the
attic
,
locked
it
,
and
threw
the
key
into
the
blanket
*NL*
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
even
going
to
look
at
a
schoolbook
in
vacation
,
''
she
told
*NL*
Marilla
.
``
I
've
studied
as
hard
all
the
term
as
I
possibly
could
and
I
've
*NL*
pored
over
that
geometry
until
I
know
every
proposition
in
the
first
*NL*
book
off
by
heart
,
even
when
the
letters
ARE
changed
.
I
just
feel
tired
*NL*
of
everything
sensible
and
I
'm
going
to
let
my
imagination
run
riot
for
*NL*
the
summer
.
Oh
,
you
need
n't
be
alarmed
,
Marilla
.
I
'll
only
let
it
run
*NL*
riot
within
reasonable
limits
.
But
I
want
to
have
a
real
good
jolly
time
*NL*
this
summer
,
for
maybe
it
's
the
last
summer
I
'll
be
a
little
girl
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Lynde
says
that
if
I
keep
stretching
out
next
year
as
I
've
done
this
*NL*
I
'll
have
to
put
on
longer
skirts
.
She
says
I
'm
all
running
to
legs
and
*NL*
eyes
.
And
when
I
put
on
longer
skirts
I
shall
feel
that
I
have
to
live
*NL*
up
to
them
and
be
very
dignified
.
It
wo
n't
even
do
to
believe
in
fairies
*NL*
then
,
I
'm
afraid
;
so
I
'm
going
to
believe
in
them
with
all
my
whole
*NL*
heart
this
summer
.
I
think
we
're
going
to
have
a
very
gay
vacation
.
Ruby
*NL*
Gillis
is
going
to
have
a
birthday
party
soon
and
there
's
the
Sunday
*NL*
school
picnic
and
the
missionary
concert
next
month
.
And
Mr.
Barry
says
*NL*
that
some
evening
he
'll
take
Diana
and
me
over
to
the
White
Sands
Hotel
*NL*
and
have
dinner
there
.
They
have
dinner
there
in
the
evening
,
you
know
.
*NL*
Jane
Andrews
was
over
once
last
summer
and
she
says
it
was
a
dazzling
*NL*
sight
to
see
the
electric
lights
and
the
flowers
and
all
the
lady
guests
*NL*
in
such
beautiful
dresses
.
Jane
says
it
was
her
first
glimpse
into
high
*NL*
life
and
she
'll
never
forget
it
to
her
dying
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
came
up
the
next
afternoon
to
find
out
why
Marilla
had
not
*NL*
been
at
the
Aid
meeting
on
Thursday
.
When
Marilla
was
not
at
Aid
meeting
*NL*
people
knew
there
was
something
wrong
at
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
had
a
bad
spell
with
his
heart
Thursday
,
''
Marilla
explained
,
*NL*
``
and
I
did
n't
feel
like
leaving
him
.
Oh
,
yes
,
he
's
all
right
again
now
,
*NL*
but
he
takes
them
spells
oftener
than
he
used
to
and
I
'm
anxious
about
*NL*
him
.
The
doctor
says
he
must
be
careful
to
avoid
excitement
.
That
's
easy
*NL*
enough
,
for
Matthew
does
n't
go
about
looking
for
excitement
by
any
means
*NL*
and
never
did
,
but
he
's
not
to
do
any
very
heavy
work
either
and
you
*NL*
might
as
well
tell
Matthew
not
to
breathe
as
not
to
work
.
Come
and
lay
*NL*
off
your
things
,
Rachel
.
You
'll
stay
to
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
seeing
you
're
so
pressing
,
perhaps
I
might
as
well
,
stay
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
and
Marilla
sat
comfortably
in
the
parlor
while
Anne
got
the
*NL*
tea
and
made
hot
biscuits
that
were
light
and
white
enough
to
defy
even
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
's
criticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
Anne
has
turned
out
a
real
smart
girl
,
''
admitted
Mrs.
*NL*
Rachel
,
as
Marilla
accompanied
her
to
the
end
of
the
lane
at
sunset
.
*NL*
``
She
must
be
a
great
help
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
,
''
said
Marilla
,
``
and
she
's
real
steady
and
reliable
now
.
I
used
*NL*
to
be
afraid
she
'd
never
get
over
her
featherbrained
ways
,
but
she
has
*NL*
and
I
would
n't
be
afraid
to
trust
her
in
anything
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
would
have
thought
she
'd
have
turned
out
so
well
that
first
day
*NL*
I
was
here
three
years
ago
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rachel
.
``
Lawful
heart
,
shall
I
*NL*
ever
forget
that
tantrum
of
hers
!
When
I
went
home
that
night
I
says
to
*NL*
Thomas
,
says
I
,
`
Mark
my
words
,
Thomas
,
Marilla
Cuthbert
'll
live
to
*NL*
rue
the
step
she
's
took
.
'
But
I
was
mistaken
and
I
'm
real
glad
of
it
.
I
*NL*
ai
n't
one
of
those
kind
of
people
,
Marilla
,
as
can
never
be
brought
to
*NL*
own
up
that
they
've
made
a
mistake
.
No
,
that
never
was
my
way
,
thank
*NL*
goodness
.
I
did
make
a
mistake
in
judging
Anne
,
but
it
were
n't
no
*NL*
wonder
,
for
an
odder
,
unexpecteder
witch
of
a
child
there
never
was
in
*NL*
this
world
,
that
's
what
.
There
was
no
ciphering
her
out
by
the
rules
*NL*
that
worked
with
other
children
.
It
's
nothing
short
of
wonderful
how
*NL*
she
's
improved
these
three
years
,
but
especially
in
looks
.
She
's
a
real
*NL*
pretty
girl
got
to
be
,
though
I
ca
n't
say
I
'm
overly
partial
to
that
*NL*
pale
,
big-eyed
style
myself
.
I
like
more
snap
and
color
,
like
Diana
*NL*
Barry
has
or
Ruby
Gillis
.
Ruby
Gillis
's
looks
are
real
showy
.
But
*NL*
somehow
--
I
do
n't
know
how
it
is
but
when
Anne
and
them
are
together
,
*NL*
though
she
ai
n't
half
as
handsome
,
she
makes
them
look
kind
of
common
*NL*
and
overdone
--
something
like
them
white
June
lilies
she
calls
narcissus
*NL*
alongside
of
the
big
,
red
peonies
,
that
's
what

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
Where
the
Brook
and
River
Meet
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
her
``
good
''
summer
and
enjoyed
it
wholeheartedly
.
She
and
Diana
*NL*
fairly
lived
outdoors
,
reveling
in
all
the
delights
that
Lover
's
Lane
*NL*
and
the
Dryad
's
Bubble
and
Willowmere
and
Victoria
Island
afforded
.
*NL*
Marilla
offered
no
objections
to
Anne
's
gypsyings
.
The
Spencervale
*NL*
doctor
who
had
come
the
night
Minnie
May
had
the
croup
met
Anne
at
the
*NL*
house
of
a
patient
one
afternoon
early
in
vacation
,
looked
her
over
*NL*
sharply
,
screwed
up
his
mouth
,
shook
his
head
,
and
sent
a
message
to
*NL*
Marilla
Cuthbert
by
another
person
.
It
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
that
redheaded
girl
of
yours
in
the
open
air
all
summer
and
do
n't
*NL*
let
her
read
books
until
she
gets
more
spring
into
her
step
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
message
frightened
Marilla
wholesomely
.
She
read
Anne
's
death
*NL*
warrant
by
consumption
in
it
unless
it
was
scrupulously
obeyed
.
As
a
*NL*
result
,
Anne
had
the
golden
summer
of
her
life
as
far
as
freedom
and
*NL*
frolic
went
.
She
walked
,
rowed
,
berried
,
and
dreamed
to
her
heart
's
*NL*
content
;
and
when
September
came
she
was
bright-eyed
and
alert
,
with
a
*NL*
step
that
would
have
satisfied
the
Spencervale
doctor
and
a
heart
full
*NL*
of
ambition
and
zest
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
just
like
studying
with
might
and
main
,
''
she
declared
as
she
*NL*
brought
her
books
down
from
the
attic
.
``
Oh
,
you
good
old
friends
,
I
'm
*NL*
glad
to
see
your
honest
faces
once
more
--
yes
,
even
you
,
geometry
.
I
've
*NL*
had
a
perfectly
beautiful
summer
,
Marilla
,
and
now
I
'm
rejoicing
as
a
*NL*
strong
man
to
run
a
race
,
as
Mr.
Allan
said
last
Sunday
.
Does
n't
Mr.
*NL*
Allan
preach
magnificent
sermons
?
Mrs.
Lynde
says
he
is
improving
every
*NL*
day
and
the
first
thing
we
know
some
city
church
will
gobble
him
up
*NL*
and
then
we
'll
be
left
and
have
to
turn
to
and
break
in
another
green
*NL*
preacher
.
But
I
do
n't
see
the
use
of
meeting
trouble
halfway
,
do
you
,
*NL*
Marilla
?
I
think
it
would
be
better
just
to
enjoy
Mr.
Allan
while
we
*NL*
have
him
.
If
I
were
a
man
I
think
I
'd
be
a
minister
.
They
can
have
*NL*
such
an
influence
for
good
,
if
their
theology
is
sound
;
and
it
must
be
*NL*
thrilling
to
preach
splendid
sermons
and
stir
your
hearers
'
hearts
.
Why
*NL*
ca
n't
women
be
ministers
,
Marilla
?
I
asked
Mrs.
Lynde
that
and
she
was
*NL*
shocked
and
said
it
would
be
a
scandalous
thing
.
She
said
there
might
*NL*
be
female
ministers
in
the
States
and
she
believed
there
was
,
but
thank
*NL*
goodness
we
had
n't
got
to
that
stage
in
Canada
yet
and
she
hoped
we
*NL*
never
would
.
But
I
do
n't
see
why
.
I
think
women
would
make
splendid
*NL*
ministers
.
When
there
is
a
social
to
be
got
up
or
a
church
tea
or
*NL*
anything
else
to
raise
money
the
women
have
to
turn
to
and
do
the
work
.
*NL*
I
'm
sure
Mrs.
Lynde
can
pray
every
bit
as
well
as
Superintendent
Bell
*NL*
and
I
've
no
doubt
she
could
preach
too
with
a
little
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
believe
she
could
,
''
said
Marilla
dryly
.
``
She
does
plenty
of
*NL*
unofficial
preaching
as
it
is
.
Nobody
has
much
of
a
chance
to
go
wrong
*NL*
in
Avonlea
with
Rachel
to
oversee
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
,
''
said
Anne
in
a
burst
of
confidence
,
``
I
want
to
tell
you
*NL*
something
and
ask
you
what
you
think
about
it
.
It
has
worried
me
*NL*
terribly
--
on
Sunday
afternoons
,
that
is
,
when
I
think
specially
about
*NL*
such
matters
.
I
do
really
want
to
be
good
;
and
when
I
'm
with
you
or
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
or
Miss
Stacy
I
want
it
more
than
ever
and
I
want
to
do
just
what
*NL*
would
please
you
and
what
you
would
approve
of
.
But
mostly
when
I
'm
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
I
feel
desperately
wicked
and
as
if
I
wanted
to
go
and
do
the
*NL*
very
thing
she
tells
me
I
ought
n't
to
do
.
I
feel
irresistibly
tempted
*NL*
to
do
it
.
Now
,
what
do
you
think
is
the
reason
I
feel
like
that
?
Do
you
*NL*
think
it
's
because
I
'm
really
bad
and
unregenerate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
dubious
for
a
moment
.
Then
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
I
guess
I
am
too
,
Anne
,
for
Rachel
often
has
that
very
*NL*
effect
on
me
.
I
sometimes
think
she
'd
have
more
of
an
influence
for
*NL*
good
,
as
you
say
yourself
,
if
she
did
n't
keep
nagging
people
to
do
*NL*
right
.
There
should
have
been
a
special
commandment
against
nagging
.
*NL*
But
there
,
I
should
n't
talk
so
.
Rachel
is
a
good
Christian
woman
and
she
*NL*
means
well
.
There
is
n't
a
kinder
soul
in
Avonlea
and
she
never
shirks
*NL*
her
share
of
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
you
feel
the
same
,
''
said
Anne
decidedly
.
``
It
's
so
*NL*
encouraging
.
I
sha
n't
worry
so
much
over
that
after
this
.
But
I
dare
say
*NL*
there
'll
be
other
things
to
worry
me
.
They
keep
coming
up
new
all
the
*NL*
time
--
things
to
perplex
you
,
you
know
.
You
settle
one
question
and
*NL*
there
's
another
right
after
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
be
thought
over
*NL*
and
decided
when
you
're
beginning
to
grow
up
.
It
keeps
me
busy
all
the
*NL*
time
thinking
them
over
and
deciding
what
is
right
.
It
's
a
serious
thing
*NL*
to
grow
up
,
is
n't
it
,
Marilla
?
But
when
I
have
such
good
friends
as
*NL*
you
and
Matthew
and
Mrs.
Allan
and
Miss
Stacy
I
ought
to
grow
up
*NL*
successfully
,
and
I
'm
sure
it
will
be
my
own
fault
if
I
do
n't
.
I
feel
*NL*
it
's
a
great
responsibility
because
I
have
only
the
one
chance
.
If
I
*NL*
do
n't
grow
up
right
I
ca
n't
go
back
and
begin
over
again
.
I
've
grown
two
*NL*
inches
this
summer
,
Marilla
.
Mr.
Gillis
measured
me
at
Ruby
's
party
.
I
'm
*NL*
so
glad
you
made
my
new
dresses
longer
.
That
dark-green
one
is
so
pretty
*NL*
and
it
was
sweet
of
you
to
put
on
the
flounce
.
Of
course
I
know
it
*NL*
was
n't
really
necessary
,
but
flounces
are
so
stylish
this
fall
and
Josie
*NL*
Pye
has
flounces
on
all
her
dresses
.
I
know
I
'll
be
able
to
study
better
*NL*
because
of
mine
.
I
shall
have
such
a
comfortable
feeling
deep
down
in
my
*NL*
mind
about
that
flounce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
worth
something
to
have
that
,
''
admitted
Marilla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stacy
came
back
to
Avonlea
school
and
found
all
her
pupils
eager
*NL*
for
work
once
more
.
Especially
did
the
Queen
's
class
gird
up
their
loins
*NL*
for
the
fray
,
for
at
the
end
of
the
coming
year
,
dimly
shadowing
their
*NL*
pathway
already
,
loomed
up
that
fateful
thing
known
as
``
the
Entrance
,
''
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
which
one
and
all
felt
their
hearts
sink
into
their
*NL*
very
shoes
.
Suppose
they
did
not
pass
!
That
thought
was
doomed
to
*NL*
haunt
Anne
through
the
waking
hours
of
that
winter
,
Sunday
afternoons
*NL*
inclusive
,
to
the
almost
entire
exclusion
of
moral
and
theological
*NL*
problems
.
When
Anne
had
bad
dreams
she
found
herself
staring
miserably
*NL*
at
pass
lists
of
the
Entrance
exams
,
where
Gilbert
Blythe
's
name
was
*NL*
blazoned
at
the
top
and
in
which
hers
did
not
appear
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
a
jolly
,
busy
,
happy
swift-flying
winter
.
Schoolwork
was
*NL*
as
interesting
,
class
rivalry
as
absorbing
,
as
of
yore
.
New
worlds
of
*NL*
thought
,
feeling
,
and
ambition
,
fresh
,
fascinating
fields
of
unexplored
*NL*
knowledge
seemed
to
be
opening
out
before
Anne
's
eager
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hills
peeped
o'er
hill
and
Alps
on
Alps
arose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Much
of
all
this
was
due
to
Miss
Stacy
's
tactful
,
careful
,
broadminded
*NL*
guidance
.
She
led
her
class
to
think
and
explore
and
discover
for
*NL*
themselves
and
encouraged
straying
from
the
old
beaten
paths
to
a
degree
*NL*
that
quite
shocked
Mrs.
Lynde
and
the
school
trustees
,
who
viewed
all
*NL*
innovations
on
established
methods
rather
dubiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
her
studies
Anne
expanded
socially
,
for
Marilla
,
mindful
of
*NL*
the
Spencervale
doctor
's
dictum
,
no
longer
vetoed
occasional
outings
.
*NL*
The
Debating
Club
flourished
and
gave
several
concerts
;
there
were
one
*NL*
or
two
parties
almost
verging
on
grown-up
affairs
;
there
were
sleigh
*NL*
drives
and
skating
frolics
galore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
times
Anne
grew
,
shooting
up
so
rapidly
that
Marilla
was
*NL*
astonished
one
day
,
when
they
were
standing
side
by
side
,
to
find
the
*NL*
girl
was
taller
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Anne
,
how
you
've
grown
!
''
she
said
,
almost
unbelievingly
.
A
sigh
*NL*
followed
on
the
words
.
Marilla
felt
a
queer
regret
over
Anne
's
inches
.
*NL*
The
child
she
had
learned
to
love
had
vanished
somehow
and
here
was
this
*NL*
tall
,
serious-eyed
girl
of
fifteen
,
with
the
thoughtful
brows
and
the
*NL*
proudly
poised
little
head
,
in
her
place
.
Marilla
loved
the
girl
as
much
*NL*
as
she
had
loved
the
child
,
but
she
was
conscious
of
a
queer
sorrowful
*NL*
sense
of
loss
.
And
that
night
,
when
Anne
had
gone
to
prayer
meeting
*NL*
with
Diana
,
Marilla
sat
alone
in
the
wintry
twilight
and
indulged
in
the
*NL*
weakness
of
a
cry
.
Matthew
,
coming
in
with
a
lantern
,
caught
her
at
it
*NL*
and
gazed
at
her
in
such
consternation
that
Marilla
had
to
laugh
through
*NL*
her
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
about
Anne
,
''
she
explained
.
``
She
's
got
to
be
such
a
big
*NL*
girl
--
and
she
'll
probably
be
away
from
us
next
winter
.
I
'll
miss
her
*NL*
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
be
able
to
come
home
often
,
''
comforted
Matthew
,
to
whom
Anne
was
*NL*
as
yet
and
always
would
be
the
little
,
eager
girl
he
had
brought
home
*NL*
from
Bright
River
on
that
June
evening
four
years
before
.
``
The
branch
*NL*
railroad
will
be
built
to
Carmody
by
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
the
same
thing
as
having
her
here
all
the
time
,
''
sighed
*NL*
Marilla
gloomily
,
determined
to
enjoy
her
luxury
of
grief
uncomforted
.
*NL*
``
But
there
--
men
ca
n't
understand
these
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
changes
in
Anne
no
less
real
than
the
physical
change
.
*NL*
For
one
thing
,
she
became
much
quieter
.
Perhaps
she
thought
all
the
*NL*
more
and
dreamed
as
much
as
ever
,
but
she
certainly
talked
less
.
Marilla
*NL*
noticed
and
commented
on
this
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
chatter
half
as
much
as
you
used
to
,
Anne
,
nor
use
half
as
*NL*
many
big
words
.
What
has
come
over
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
colored
and
laughed
a
little
,
as
she
dropped
her
book
and
looked
*NL*
dreamily
out
of
the
window
,
where
big
fat
red
buds
were
bursting
out
on
*NL*
the
creeper
in
response
to
the
lure
of
the
spring
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
I
do
n't
want
to
talk
as
much
,
''
she
said
,
denting
her
*NL*
chin
thoughtfully
with
her
forefinger
.
``
It
's
nicer
to
think
dear
,
pretty
*NL*
thoughts
and
keep
them
in
one
's
heart
,
like
treasures
.
I
do
n't
like
to
*NL*
have
them
laughed
at
or
wondered
over
.
And
somehow
I
do
n't
want
to
use
*NL*
big
words
any
more
.
It
's
almost
a
pity
,
is
n't
it
,
now
that
I
'm
really
*NL*
growing
big
enough
to
say
them
if
I
did
want
to
.
It
's
fun
to
be
almost
*NL*
grown
up
in
some
ways
,
but
it
's
not
the
kind
of
fun
I
expected
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
There
's
so
much
to
learn
and
do
and
think
that
there
is
n't
time
for
big
*NL*
words
.
Besides
,
Miss
Stacy
says
the
short
ones
are
much
stronger
and
*NL*
better
.
She
makes
us
write
all
our
essays
as
simply
as
possible
.
It
was
*NL*
hard
at
first
.
I
was
so
used
to
crowding
in
all
the
fine
big
words
I
*NL*
could
think
of
--
and
I
thought
of
any
number
of
them
.
But
I
've
got
used
*NL*
to
it
now
and
I
see
it
's
so
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
your
story
club
?
I
have
n't
heard
you
speak
of
it
for
*NL*
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
story
club
is
n't
in
existence
any
longer
.
We
had
n't
time
for
*NL*
it
--
and
anyhow
I
think
we
had
got
tired
of
it
.
It
was
silly
to
be
*NL*
writing
about
love
and
murder
and
elopements
and
mysteries
.
Miss
Stacy
*NL*
sometimes
has
us
write
a
story
for
training
in
composition
,
but
she
*NL*
wo
n't
let
us
write
anything
but
what
might
happen
in
Avonlea
in
our
own
*NL*
lives
,
and
she
criticizes
it
very
sharply
and
makes
us
criticize
our
own
*NL*
too
.
I
never
thought
my
compositions
had
so
many
faults
until
I
began
to
*NL*
look
for
them
myself
.
I
felt
so
ashamed
I
wanted
to
give
up
altogether
,
*NL*
but
Miss
Stacy
said
I
could
learn
to
write
well
if
I
only
trained
myself
*NL*
to
be
my
own
severest
critic
.
And
so
I
am
trying
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
only
two
more
months
before
the
Entrance
,
''
said
Marilla
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
think
you
'll
be
able
to
get
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Sometimes
I
think
I
'll
be
all
right
--
and
then
I
get
*NL*
horribly
afraid
.
We
've
studied
hard
and
Miss
Stacy
has
drilled
us
*NL*
thoroughly
,
but
we
may
n't
get
through
for
all
that
.
We
've
each
got
a
*NL*
stumbling
block
.
Mine
is
geometry
of
course
,
and
Jane
's
is
Latin
,
and
*NL*
Ruby
and
Charlie
's
is
algebra
,
and
Josie
's
is
arithmetic
.
Moody
Spurgeon
*NL*
says
he
feels
it
in
his
bones
that
he
is
going
to
fail
in
English
*NL*
history
.
Miss
Stacy
is
going
to
give
us
examinations
in
June
just
as
*NL*
hard
as
we
'll
have
at
the
Entrance
and
mark
us
just
as
strictly
,
so
*NL*
we
'll
have
some
idea
.
I
wish
it
was
all
over
,
Marilla
.
It
haunts
me
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
wake
up
in
the
night
and
wonder
what
I
'll
do
if
I
do
n't
*NL*
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
go
to
school
next
year
and
try
again
,
''
said
Marilla
unconcernedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
believe
I
'd
have
the
heart
for
it
.
It
would
be
such
a
*NL*
disgrace
to
fail
,
especially
if
Gil
--
if
the
others
passed
.
And
I
get
so
*NL*
nervous
in
an
examination
that
I
'm
likely
to
make
a
mess
of
it
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
nerves
like
Jane
Andrews
.
Nothing
rattles
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
and
,
dragging
her
eyes
from
the
witcheries
of
the
spring
*NL*
world
,
the
beckoning
day
of
breeze
and
blue
,
and
the
green
things
*NL*
upspringing
in
the
garden
,
buried
herself
resolutely
in
her
book
.
*NL*
There
would
be
other
springs
,
but
if
she
did
not
succeed
in
passing
the
*NL*
Entrance
,
Anne
felt
convinced
that
she
would
never
recover
sufficiently
*NL*
to
enjoy
them
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
The
Pass
List
Is
Out
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
end
of
June
came
the
close
of
the
term
and
the
close
of
Miss
*NL*
Stacy
's
rule
in
Avonlea
school
.
Anne
and
Diana
walked
home
that
*NL*
evening
feeling
very
sober
indeed
.
Red
eyes
and
damp
handkerchiefs
bore
*NL*
convincing
testimony
to
the
fact
that
Miss
Stacy
's
farewell
words
must
*NL*
have
been
quite
as
touching
as
Mr.
Phillips
's
had
been
under
similar
*NL*
circumstances
three
years
before
.
Diana
looked
back
at
the
schoolhouse
*NL*
from
the
foot
of
the
spruce
hill
and
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
seem
as
if
it
was
the
end
of
everything
,
does
n't
it
?
''
she
said
*NL*
dismally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
n't
to
feel
half
as
badly
as
I
do
,
''
said
Anne
,
hunting
vainly
*NL*
for
a
dry
spot
on
her
handkerchief
.
``
You
'll
be
back
again
next
winter
,
*NL*
but
I
suppose
I
've
left
the
dear
old
school
forever
--
if
I
have
good
*NL*
luck
,
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
a
bit
the
same
.
Miss
Stacy
wo
n't
be
there
,
nor
you
nor
Jane
*NL*
nor
Ruby
probably
.
I
shall
have
to
sit
all
alone
,
for
I
could
n't
bear
*NL*
to
have
another
deskmate
after
you
.
Oh
,
we
have
had
jolly
times
,
have
n't
*NL*
we
,
Anne
?
It
's
dreadful
to
think
they
're
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
big
tears
rolled
down
by
Diana
's
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
stop
crying
I
could
,
''
said
Anne
imploringly
.
``
Just
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
put
away
my
hanky
I
see
you
brimming
up
and
that
starts
me
off
*NL*
again
.
As
Mrs.
Lynde
says
,
`
If
you
ca
n't
be
cheerful
,
be
as
cheerful
as
*NL*
you
can
.
'
After
all
,
I
dare
say
I
'll
be
back
next
year
.
This
is
one
*NL*
of
the
times
I
KNOW
I
'm
not
going
to
pass
.
They
're
getting
alarmingly
*NL*
frequent
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
came
out
splendidly
in
the
exams
Miss
Stacy
gave

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
those
exams
did
n't
make
me
nervous

When
I
think
of
the
real
*NL*
thing
you
ca
n't
imagine
what
a
horrid
cold
fluttery
feeling
comes
round
*NL*
my
heart
.
And
then
my
number
is
thirteen
and
Josie
Pye
says
it
's
so
*NL*
unlucky
.
I
am
NOT
superstitious
and
I
know
it
can
make
no
difference
.
*NL*
But
still
I
wish
it
was
n't
thirteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
wish
I
was
going
in
with
you
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
Would
n't
we
have
*NL*
a
perfectly
elegant
time
?
But
I
suppose
you
'll
have
to
cram
in
the
*NL*
evenings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
Miss
Stacy
has
made
us
promise
not
to
open
a
book
at
all
.
She
says
*NL*
it
would
only
tire
and
confuse
us
and
we
are
to
go
out
walking
and
not
*NL*
think
about
the
exams
at
all
and
go
to
bed
early
.
It
's
good
advice
,
but
*NL*
I
expect
it
will
be
hard
to
follow
;
good
advice
is
apt
to
be
,
I
think

*NL*
Prissy
Andrews
told
me
that
she
sat
up
half
the
night
every
night
of
her
*NL*
Entrance
week
and
crammed
for
dear
life
;
and
I
had
determined
to
sit
up
*NL*
AT
LEAST
as
long
as
she
did
.
It
was
so
kind
of
your
Aunt
Josephine
to
*NL*
ask
me
to
stay
at
Beechwood
while
I
'm
in
town

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll

``
I
'll
write
Tuesday
night

promised
*NL*
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
haunting
the
post
office
Wednesday

''
vowed
Diana
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
to
town
the
following
Monday
and
on
Wednesday
Diana
haunted
*NL*
the
post
office
,
as
agreed
,
and
got
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest

-LSB-
wrote
Anne

*NL*
``
Here
it
is
Tuesday
night
and
I
'm
writing
this
in
the
library
at
*NL*
Beechwood

Last
night
I
was
horribly
lonesome
all
alone
in
my
room
and
*NL*
wished
so
much
you
were
with
me
.
I
could
n't
``
cram
''
because
I
'd
promised
*NL*
Miss
Stacy
not
to
,
but
it
was
as
hard
to
keep
from
opening
my
history
*NL*
as
it
used
to
be
to
keep
from
reading
a
story
before
my
lessons
were
*NL*
learned

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
Miss
Stacy
came
for
me
and
we
went
to
the
Academy
,
calling
*NL*
for
Jane
and
Ruby
and
Josie
on
our
way
.
Ruby
asked
me
to
feel
her
hands
*NL*
and
they
were
as
cold
as
ice
.
Josie
said
I
looked
as
if
I
had
n't
slept
*NL*
a
wink
and
she
did
n't
believe
I
was
strong
enough
to
stand
the
grind
*NL*
of
the
teacher
's
course
even
if
I
did
get
through
.
There
are
times
and
*NL*
seasons
even
yet
when
I
do
n't
feel
that
I
've
made
any
great
headway
in
*NL*
learning
to
like
Josie
Pye
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
reached
the
Academy
there
were
scores
of
students
there
from
*NL*
all
over
the
Island
.
The
first
person
we
saw
was
Moody
Spurgeon
sitting
*NL*
on
the
steps
and
muttering
away
to
himself
.
Jane
asked
him
what
on
earth
*NL*
he
was
doing
and
he
said
he
was
repeating
the
multiplication
table
over
*NL*
and
over
to
steady
his
nerves
and
for
pity
's
sake
not
to
interrupt
*NL*
him
,
because
if
he
stopped
for
a
moment
he
got
frightened
and
forgot
*NL*
everything
he
ever
knew
,
but
the
multiplication
table
kept
all
his
facts
*NL*
firmly
in
their
proper
place
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
assigned
to
our
rooms
Miss
Stacy
had
to
leave
us
.
Jane
and
*NL*
I
sat
together
and
Jane
was
so
composed
that
I
envied
her
.
No
need
of
*NL*
the
multiplication
table
for
good
,
steady
,
sensible
Jane
!
I
wondered
if
*NL*
I
looked
as
I
felt
and
if
they
could
hear
my
heart
thumping
clear
*NL*
across
the
room
.
Then
a
man
came
in
and
began
distributing
the
English
*NL*
examination
sheets
.
My
hands
grew
cold
then
and
my
head
fairly
whirled
*NL*
around
as
I
picked
it
up
.
Just
one
awful
moment
--
Diana
,
I
felt
exactly
*NL*
as
I
did
four
years
ago
when
I
asked
Marilla
if
I
might
stay
at
Green
*NL*
Gables
--
and
then
everything
cleared
up
in
my
mind
and
my
heart
began
*NL*
beating
again
--
I
forgot
to
say
that
it
had
stopped
altogether
!
--
for
I
*NL*
knew
I
could
do
something
with
THAT
paper
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
noon
we
went
home
for
dinner
and
then
back
again
for
history
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
.
The
history
was
a
pretty
hard
paper
and
I
got
dreadfully
*NL*
mixed
up
in
the
dates
.
Still
,
I
think
I
did
fairly
well
today
.
But
oh
,
*NL*
Diana
,
tomorrow
the
geometry
exam
comes
off
and
when
I
think
of
it
*NL*
it
takes
every
bit
of
determination
I
possess
to
keep
from
opening
my
*NL*
Euclid
.
If
I
thought
the
multiplication
table
would
help
me
any
I
would
*NL*
recite
it
from
now
till
tomorrow
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
down
to
see
the
other
girls
this
evening
.
On
my
way
I
met
Moody
*NL*
Spurgeon
wandering
distractedly
around
.
He
said
he
knew
he
had
failed
in
*NL*
history
and
he
was
born
to
be
a
disappointment
to
his
parents
and
he
*NL*
was
going
home
on
the
morning
train
;
and
it
would
be
easier
to
be
a
*NL*
carpenter
than
a
minister
,
anyhow
.
I
cheered
him
up
and
persuaded
him
to
*NL*
stay
to
the
end
because
it
would
be
unfair
to
Miss
Stacy
if
he
did
n't
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
have
wished
I
was
born
a
boy
,
but
when
I
see
Moody
Spurgeon
*NL*
I
'm
always
glad
I
'm
a
girl
and
not
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ruby
was
in
hysterics
when
I
reached
their
boardinghouse
;
she
had
just
*NL*
discovered
a
fearful
mistake
she
had
made
in
her
English
paper
.
When
*NL*
she
recovered
we
went
uptown
and
had
an
ice
cream
.
How
we
wished
you
had
*NL*
been
with
us

Oh
,
Diana
,
if
only
the
geometry
examination
were
over
!
But
there
,
as
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
would
say
,
the
sun
will
go
on
rising
and
setting
whether
I
*NL*
fail
in
geometry
or
not
.
That
is
true
but
not
especially
comforting

I
*NL*
think
I

rather
it
did
n't
go
on

I
failed

The
geometry
examination
and
all
the
others
were
over
in
due
time
and
*NL*
Anne
arrived
home
on
Friday
evening
,
rather
tired
but
with
an
air
of
*NL*
chastened
triumph
about
her
.
Diana
was
over
at
Green
Gables
when
she
*NL*
arrived
and
they
met
as
if
they
had
been
parted
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
old
darling
,
it
's
perfectly
splendid
to
see
you
back
again
.
It
*NL*
seems
like
an
age
since
you
went
to
town
and
oh
,
Anne
,
how
did
you
get
*NL*
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
,
I
think
,
in
everything
but
the
geometry
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
whether
I
passed
in
it
or
not
and
I
have
a
creepy
,
crawly
presentiment
*NL*
that
I
did
n't
.
Oh
,
how
good
it
is
to
be
back
!
Green
Gables
is
the
*NL*
dearest
,
loveliest
spot
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
the
others
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girls
say
they
know
they
did
n't
pass
,
but
I
think
they
did
pretty
*NL*
well
.
Josie
says
the
geometry
was
so
easy
a
child
of
ten
could
do
it
!
*NL*
Moody
Spurgeon
still
thinks
he
failed
in
history
and
Charlie
says
he
*NL*
failed
in
algebra
.
But
we
do
n't
really
know
anything
about
it
and
wo
n't
*NL*
until
the
pass
list
is
out
.
That
wo
n't
be
for
a
fortnight
.
Fancy
living
*NL*
a
fortnight
in
such
suspense
!
I
wish
I
could
go
to
sleep
and
never
wake
*NL*
up
until
it
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
knew
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
how
Gilbert
Blythe
had
fared
,
so
*NL*
she
merely
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
pass
all
right
.
Do
n't
worry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
not
pass
at
all
than
not
come
out
pretty
well
up
on
the
*NL*
list
,
''
flashed
Anne
,
by
which
she
meant
--
and
Diana
knew
she
meant
--
that
*NL*
success
would
be
incomplete
and
bitter
if
she
did
not
come
out
ahead
of
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
end
in
view
Anne
had
strained
every
nerve
during
the
*NL*
examinations
.
So
had
Gilbert
.
They
had
met
and
passed
each
other
on
the
*NL*
street
a
dozen
times
without
any
sign
of
recognition
and
every
time
Anne
*NL*
had
held
her
head
a
little
higher
and
wished
a
little
more
earnestly
*NL*
that
she
had
made
friends
with
Gilbert
when
he
asked
her
,
and
vowed
a
*NL*
little
more
determinedly
to
surpass
him
in
the
examination
.
She
knew
*NL*
that
all
Avonlea
junior
was
wondering
which
would
come
out
first
;
she
*NL*
even
knew
that
Jimmy
Glover
and
Ned
Wright
had
a
bet
on
the
question
*NL*
and
that
Josie
Pye
had
said
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
Gilbert
*NL*
would
be
first
;
and
she
felt
that
her
humiliation
would
be
unbearable
if
*NL*
she
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
another
and
nobler
motive
for
wishing
to
do
well
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
``
pass
high
''
for
the
sake
of
Matthew
and
Marilla
--
especially
Matthew
.
*NL*
Matthew
had
declared
to
her
his
conviction
that
she
``
would
beat
the
*NL*
whole
Island
.
''
That
,
Anne
felt
,
was
something
it
would
be
foolish
to
*NL*
hope
for
even
in
the
wildest
dreams
.
But
she
did
hope
fervently
that
she
*NL*
would
be
among
the
first
ten
at
least
,
so
that
she
might
see
Matthew
's
*NL*
kindly
brown
eyes
gleam
with
pride
in
her
achievement
.
That
,
she
*NL*
felt
,
would
be
a
sweet
reward
indeed
for
all
her
hard
work
and
patient
*NL*
grubbing
among
unimaginative
equations
and
conjugations
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
fortnight
Anne
took
to
``
haunting
''
the
post
office
*NL*
also
,
in
the
distracted
company
of
Jane
,
Ruby
,
and
Josie
,
opening
the
*NL*
Charlottetown
dailies
with
shaking
hands
and
cold
,
sinkaway
feelings
*NL*
as
bad
as
any
experienced
during
the
Entrance
week
.
Charlie
and
Gilbert
*NL*
were
not
above
doing
this
too
,
but
Moody
Spurgeon
stayed
resolutely
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
the
grit
to
go
there
and
look
at
a
paper
in
cold
blood
,
''
*NL*
he
told
Anne
.
``
I
'm
just
going
to
wait
until
somebody
comes
and
tells
me
*NL*
suddenly
whether
I
've
passed
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
three
weeks
had
gone
by
without
the
pass
list
appearing
Anne
began
*NL*
to
feel
that
she
really
could
n't
stand
the
strain
much
longer
.
Her
*NL*
appetite
failed
and
her
interest
in
Avonlea
doings
languished
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
wanted
to
know
what
else
you
could
expect
with
a
Tory
*NL*
superintendent
of
education
at
the
head
of
affairs
,
and
Matthew
,
noting
*NL*
Anne
's
paleness
and
indifference
and
the
lagging
steps
that
bore
her
*NL*
home
from
the
post
office
every
afternoon
,
began
seriously
to
wonder
if
*NL*
he
had
n't
better
vote
Grit
at
the
next
election
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
evening
the
news
came
.
Anne
was
sitting
at
her
open
window
,
*NL*
for
the
time
forgetful
of
the
woes
of
examinations
and
the
cares
of
the
*NL*
world
,
as
she
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
summer
dusk
,
sweet-scented
with
*NL*
flower
breaths
from
the
garden
below
and
sibilant
and
rustling
from
the
*NL*
stir
of
poplars
.
The
eastern
sky
above
the
firs
was
flushed
faintly
pink
*NL*
from
the
reflection
of
the
west
,
and
Anne
was
wondering
dreamily
if
the
*NL*
spirit
of
color
looked
like
that
,
when
she
saw
Diana
come
flying
*NL*
down
through
the
firs
,
over
the
log
bridge
,
and
up
the
slope
,
with
a
*NL*
fluttering
newspaper
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sprang
to
her
feet
,
knowing
at
once
what
that
paper
contained
.
The
*NL*
pass
list
was
out
!
Her
head
whirled
and
her
heart
beat
until
it
hurt
*NL*
her
.
She
could
not
move
a
step
.
It
seemed
an
hour
to
her
before
Diana
*NL*
came
rushing
along
the
hall
and
burst
into
the
room
without
even
*NL*
knocking
,
so
great
was
her
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
you
've
passed
,
''
she
cried
,
``
passed
the
VERY
FIRST
--
you
and
*NL*
Gilbert
both
--
you
're
ties
--
but
your
name
is
first
.
Oh
,
I
'm
so
proud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
flung
the
paper
on
the
table
and
herself
on
Anne
's
bed
,
utterly
*NL*
breathless
and
incapable
of
further
speech
.
Anne
lighted
the
lamp
,
*NL*
oversetting
the
match
safe
and
using
up
half
a
dozen
matches
before
her
*NL*
shaking
hands
could
accomplish
the
task
.
Then
she
snatched
up
the
paper
.
*NL*
Yes
,
she
had
passed
--
there
was
her
name
at
the
very
top
of
a
list
of
two
*NL*
hundred
!
That
moment
was
worth
living
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
just
splendidly
,
Anne
,
''
puffed
Diana
,
recovering
sufficiently
*NL*
to
sit
up
and
speak
,
for
Anne
,
starry
eyed
and
rapt
,
had
not
uttered
a
*NL*
word
.
``
Father
brought
the
paper
home
from
Bright
River
not
ten
minutes
*NL*
ago
--
it
came
out
on
the
afternoon
train
,
you
know
,
and
wo
n't
be
here
*NL*
till
tomorrow
by
mail
--
and
when
I
saw
the
pass
list
I
just
rushed
over
*NL*
like
a
wild
thing
.
You
've
all
passed
,
every
one
of
you
,
Moody
Spurgeon
*NL*
and
all
,
although
he
's
conditioned
in
history
.
Jane
and
Ruby
did
pretty
*NL*
well
--
they
're
halfway
up
--
and
so
did
Charlie
.
Josie
just
scraped
through
*NL*
with
three
marks
to
spare
,
but
you
'll
see
she
'll
put
on
as
many
airs
as
*NL*
if
she
'd
led
.
Wo
n't
Miss
Stacy
be
delighted
?
Oh
,
Anne
,
what
does
it
feel
*NL*
like
to
see
your
name
at
the
head
of
a
pass
list
like
that
?
If
it
were
*NL*
me
I
know
I
'd
go
crazy
with
joy
.
I
am
pretty
near
crazy
as
it
is
,
but
*NL*
you
're
as
calm
and
cool
as
a
spring
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
just
dazzled
inside
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
I
want
to
say
a
hundred
things
,
*NL*
and
I
ca
n't
find
words
to
say
them
in
.
I
never
dreamed
of
this
--
yes
,
I
*NL*
did
too
,
just
once
!
I
let
myself
think
ONCE
,
`
What
if
I
should
come
out
*NL*
first
?
'
quakingly
,
you
know
,
for
it
seemed
so
vain
and
presumptuous
to
*NL*
think
I
could
lead
the
Island
.
Excuse
me
a
minute
,
Diana
.
I
must
run
*NL*
right
out
to
the
field
to
tell
Matthew
.
Then
we
'll
go
up
the
road
and
*NL*
tell
the
good
news
to
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
hurried
to
the
hayfield
below
the
barn
where
Matthew
was
coiling
*NL*
hay
,
and
,
as
luck
would
have
it
,
Mrs.
Lynde
was
talking
to
Marilla
at
*NL*
the
lane
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Matthew
,
''
exclaimed
Anne
,
``
I
've
passed
and
I
'm
first
--
or
one
of
the
*NL*
first
!
I
'm
not
vain
,
but
I
'm
thankful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
always
said
it
,
''
said
Matthew
,
gazing
at
the
pass
list
*NL*
delightedly
.
``
I
knew
you
could
beat
them
all
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
done
pretty
well
,
I
must
say
,
Anne
,
''
said
Marilla
,
trying
to
*NL*
hide
her
extreme
pride
in
Anne
from
Mrs.
Rachel
's
critical
eye
.
But
that
*NL*
good
soul
said
heartily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
guess
she
has
done
well
,
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
be
backward
in
*NL*
saying
it
.
You
're
a
credit
to
your
friends
,
Anne
,
that
's
what
,
and
we
're
*NL*
all
proud
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Anne
,
who
had
wound
up
the
delightful
evening
with
a
serious
*NL*
little
talk
with
Mrs.
Allan
at
the
manse
,
knelt
sweetly
by
her
open
*NL*
window
in
a
great
sheen
of
moonshine
and
murmured
a
prayer
of
gratitude
*NL*
and
aspiration
that
came
straight
from
her
heart
.
There
was
in
it
*NL*
thankfulness
for
the
past
and
reverent
petition
for
the
future
;
and
when
*NL*
she
slept
on
her
white
pillow
her
dreams
were
as
fair
and
bright
and
*NL*
beautiful
as
maidenhood
might
desire

CHAPTER
XXXIII
.
The
Hotel
Concert
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
your
white
organdy
,
by
all
means
,
Anne
,
''
advised
Diana
*NL*
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
together
in
the
east
gable
chamber
;
outside
it
was
only
*NL*
twilight
--
a
lovely
yellowish-green
twilight
with
a
clear-blue
cloudless
*NL*
sky
.
A
big
round
moon
,
slowly
deepening
from
her
pallid
luster
into
*NL*
burnished
silver
,
hung
over
the
Haunted
Wood
;
the
air
was
full
of
sweet
*NL*
summer
sounds
--
sleepy
birds
twittering
,
freakish
breezes
,
faraway
*NL*
voices
and
laughter
.
But
in
Anne
's
room
the
blind
was
drawn
and
the
lamp
*NL*
lighted
,
for
an
important
toilet
was
being
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
east
gable
was
a
very
different
place
from
what
it
had
been
on
that
*NL*
night
four
years
before
,
when
Anne
had
felt
its
bareness
penetrate
to
*NL*
the
marrow
of
her
spirit
with
its
inhospitable
chill
.
Changes
had
crept
*NL*
in
,
Marilla
conniving
at
them
resignedly
,
until
it
was
as
sweet
and
*NL*
dainty
a
nest
as
a
young
girl
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
velvet
carpet
with
the
pink
roses
and
the
pink
silk
curtains
of
*NL*
Anne
's
early
visions
had
certainly
never
materialized
;
but
her
dreams
*NL*
had
kept
pace
with
her
growth
,
and
it
is
not
probable
she
lamented
*NL*
them
.
The
floor
was
covered
with
a
pretty
matting
,
and
the
curtains
that
*NL*
softened
the
high
window
and
fluttered
in
the
vagrant
breezes
were
of
*NL*
pale-green
art
muslin
.
The
walls
,
hung
not
with
gold
and
silver
brocade
*NL*
tapestry
,
but
with
a
dainty
apple-blossom
paper
,
were
adorned
with
a
few
*NL*
good
pictures
given
Anne
by
Mrs.
Allan
.
Miss
Stacy
's
photograph
occupied
*NL*
the
place
of
honor
,
and
Anne
made
a
sentimental
point
of
keeping
fresh
*NL*
flowers
on
the
bracket
under
it
.
Tonight
a
spike
of
white
lilies
faintly
*NL*
perfumed
the
room
like
the
dream
of
a
fragrance
.
There
was
no
``
mahogany
*NL*
furniture
,
''
but
there
was
a
white-painted
bookcase
filled
with
books
,
a
*NL*
cushioned
wicker
rocker
,
a
toilet
table
befrilled
with
white
muslin
,
*NL*
a
quaint
,
gilt-framed
mirror
with
chubby
pink
Cupids
and
purple
grapes
*NL*
painted
over
its
arched
top
,
that
used
to
hang
in
the
spare
room
,
and
a
*NL*
low
white
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
dressing
for
a
concert
at
the
White
Sands
Hotel
.
The
guests
had
*NL*
got
it
up
in
aid
of
the
Charlottetown
hospital
,
and
had
hunted
out
all
*NL*
the
available
amateur
talent
in
the
surrounding
districts
to
help
it
*NL*
along
.
Bertha
Sampson
and
Pearl
Clay
of
the
White
Sands
Baptist
choir
*NL*
had
been
asked
to
sing
a
duet
;
Milton
Clark
of
Newbridge
was
to
give
a
*NL*
violin
solo
;
Winnie
Adella
Blair
of
Carmody
was
to
sing
a
Scotch
ballad
;
*NL*
and
Laura
Spencer
of
Spencervale
and
Anne
Shirley
of
Avonlea
were
to
*NL*
recite
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Anne
would
have
said
at
one
time
,
it
was
``
an
epoch
in
her
life
,
''
and
*NL*
she
was
deliciously
athrill
with
the
excitement
of
it
.
Matthew
was
in
*NL*
the
seventh
heaven
of
gratified
pride
over
the
honor
conferred
on
his
*NL*
Anne
and
Marilla
was
not
far
behind
,
although
she
would
have
died
rather
*NL*
than
admit
it
,
and
said
she
did
n't
think
it
was
very
proper
for
a
lot
*NL*
of
young
folks
to
be
gadding
over
to
the
hotel
without
any
responsible
*NL*
person
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
Diana
were
to
drive
over
with
Jane
Andrews
and
her
brother
*NL*
Billy
in
their
double-seated
buggy
;
and
several
other
Avonlea
girls
and
*NL*
boys
were
going
too
.
There
was
a
party
of
visitors
expected
out
from
*NL*
town
,
and
after
the
concert
a
supper
was
to
be
given
to
the
performers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
the
organdy
will
be
best
?
''
queried
Anne
anxiously
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
as
pretty
as
my
blue-flowered
muslin
--
and
it
*NL*
certainly
is
n't
so
fashionable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
suits
you
ever
so
much
better
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
It
's
so
soft
*NL*
and
frilly
and
clinging
.
The
muslin
is
stiff
,
and
makes
you
look
too
*NL*
dressed
up
.
But
the
organdy
seems
as
if
it
grew
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sighed
and
yielded
.
Diana
was
beginning
to
have
a
reputation
for
*NL*
notable
taste
in
dressing
,
and
her
advice
on
such
subjects
was
much
*NL*
sought
after
.
She
was
looking
very
pretty
herself
on
this
particular
*NL*
night
in
a
dress
of
the
lovely
wild-rose
pink
,
from
which
Anne
was
*NL*
forever
debarred
;
but
she
was
not
to
take
any
part
in
the
concert
,
so
*NL*
her
appearance
was
of
minor
importance
.
All
her
pains
were
bestowed
upon
*NL*
Anne
,
who
,
she
vowed
,
must
,
for
the
credit
of
Avonlea
,
be
dressed
and
*NL*
combed
and
adorned
to
the
Queen
's
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pull
out
that
frill
a
little
more
--
so
;
here
,
let
me
tie
your
sash
;
now
*NL*
for
your
slippers
.
I
'm
going
to
braid
your
hair
in
two
thick
braids
,
*NL*
and
tie
them
halfway
up
with
big
white
bows
--
no
,
do
n't
pull
out
a
single
*NL*
curl
over
your
forehead
--
just
have
the
soft
part
.
There
is
no
way
you
do
*NL*
your
hair
suits
you
so
well
,
Anne
,
and
Mrs.
Allan
says
you
look
like
a
*NL*
Madonna
when
you
part
it
so
.
I
shall
fasten
this
little
white
house
rose
*NL*
just
behind
your
ear
.
There
was
just
one
on
my
bush
,
and
I
saved
it
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
put
my
pearl
beads
on
?
''
asked
Anne
.
``
Matthew
brought
me
a
*NL*
string
from
town
last
week
,
and
I
know
he
'd
like
to
see
them
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
pursed
up
her
lips
,
put
her
black
head
on
one
side
critically
,
*NL*
and
finally
pronounced
in
favor
of
the
beads
,
which
were
thereupon
tied
*NL*
around
Anne
's
slim
milk-white
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
so
stylish
about
you
,
Anne
,
''
said
Diana
,
with
*NL*
unenvious
admiration
.
``
You
hold
your
head
with
such
an
air
.
I
suppose
*NL*
it
's
your
figure
.
I
am
just
a
dumpling
.
I
've
always
been
afraid
of
it
,
*NL*
and
now
I
know
it
is
so
.
Well
,
I
suppose
I
shall
just
have
to
resign
*NL*
myself
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
such
dimples
,
''
said
Anne
,
smiling
affectionately
into
the
*NL*
pretty
,
vivacious
face
so
near
her
own
.
``
Lovely
dimples
,
like
little
*NL*
dents
in
cream
.
I
have
given
up
all
hope
of
dimples
.
My
dimple-dream
*NL*
will
never
come
true
;
but
so
many
of
my
dreams
have
that
I
must
n't
*NL*
complain
.
Am
I
all
ready
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
ready
,
''
assured
Diana
,
as
Marilla
appeared
in
the
doorway
,
a
gaunt
*NL*
figure
with
grayer
hair
than
of
yore
and
no
fewer
angles
,
but
with
a
*NL*
much
softer
face
.
``
Come
right
in
and
look
at
our
elocutionist
,
Marilla
.
*NL*
Does
n't
she
look
lovely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
emitted
a
sound
between
a
sniff
and
a
grunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looks
neat
and
proper
.
I
like
that
way
of
fixing
her
hair
.
But
I
*NL*
expect
she
'll
ruin
that
dress
driving
over
there
in
the
dust
and
dew
*NL*
with
it
,
and
it
looks
most
too
thin
for
these
damp
nights
.
Organdy
's
the
*NL*
most
unserviceable
stuff
in
the
world
anyhow
,
and
I
told
Matthew
so
when
*NL*
he
got
it
.
But
there
is
no
use
in
saying
anything
to
Matthew
nowadays
.
*NL*
Time
was
when
he
would
take
my
advice
,
but
now
he
just
buys
things
for
*NL*
Anne
regardless
,
and
the
clerks
at
Carmody
know
they
can
palm
anything
*NL*
off
on
him
.
Just
let
them
tell
him
a
thing
is
pretty
and
fashionable
,
*NL*
and
Matthew
plunks
his
money
down
for
it
.
Mind
you
keep
your
skirt
clear
*NL*
of
the
wheel
,
Anne
,
and
put
your
warm
jacket
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Marilla
stalked
downstairs
,
thinking
proudly
how
sweet
Anne
looked
,
*NL*
with
that
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moonbeam
from
the
forehead
to
the
crown
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
and
regretting
that
she
could
not
go
to
the
concert
herself
to
hear
her
*NL*
girl
recite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
it
IS
too
damp
for
my
dress
,
''
said
Anne
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
,
''
said
Diana
,
pulling
up
the
window
blind
.
``
It
's
a
*NL*
perfect
night
,
and
there
wo
n't
be
any
dew
.
Look
at
the
moonlight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
my
window
looks
east
into
the
sunrising
,
''
said
Anne
,
going
*NL*
over
to
Diana
.
``
It
's
so
splendid
to
see
the
morning
coming
up
over
those
*NL*
long
hills
and
glowing
through
those
sharp
fir
tops
.
It
's
new
every
*NL*
morning
,
and
I
feel
as
if
I
washed
my
very
soul
in
that
bath
of
earliest
*NL*
sunshine
.
Oh
,
Diana
,
I
love
this
little
room
so
dearly
.
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
I
'll
get
along
without
it
when
I
go
to
town
next
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
of
your
going
away
tonight
,
''
begged
Diana
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
think
of
it
,
it
makes
me
so
miserable
,
and
I
do
want
to
have
a
good
time
*NL*
this
evening
.
What
are
you
going
to
recite
,
Anne
?
And
are
you
nervous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
I
've
recited
so
often
in
public
I
do
n't
mind
at
all
now
.
*NL*
I
've
decided
to
give
`
The
Maiden
's
Vow
.
'
It
's
so
pathetic
.
Laura
Spencer
*NL*
is
going
to
give
a
comic
recitation
,
but
I
'd
rather
make
people
cry
than
*NL*
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
recite
if
they
encore
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
dream
of
encoring
me
,
''
scoffed
Anne
,
who
was
not
without
her
*NL*
own
secret
hopes
that
they
would
,
and
already
visioned
herself
telling
*NL*
Matthew
all
about
it
at
the
next
morning
's
breakfast
table
.
``
There
are
*NL*
Billy
and
Jane
now
--
I
hear
the
wheels
.
Come
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Billy
Andrews
insisted
that
Anne
should
ride
on
the
front
seat
with
him
,
*NL*
so
she
unwillingly
climbed
up
.
She
would
have
much
preferred
to
sit
*NL*
back
with
the
girls
,
where
she
could
have
laughed
and
chattered
to
her
*NL*
heart
's
content
.
There
was
not
much
of
either
laughter
or
chatter
*NL*
in
Billy
.
He
was
a
big
,
fat
,
stolid
youth
of
twenty
,
with
a
round
,
*NL*
expressionless
face
,
and
a
painful
lack
of
conversational
gifts
.
But
he
*NL*
admired
Anne
immensely
,
and
was
puffed
up
with
pride
over
the
prospect
*NL*
of
driving
to
White
Sands
with
that
slim
,
upright
figure
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
,
by
dint
of
talking
over
her
shoulder
to
the
girls
and
occasionally
*NL*
passing
a
sop
of
civility
to
Billy
--
who
grinned
and
chuckled
and
never
*NL*
could
think
of
any
reply
until
it
was
too
late
--
contrived
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
drive
in
spite
of
all
.
It
was
a
night
for
enjoyment
.
The
road
was
full
*NL*
of
buggies
,
all
bound
for
the
hotel
,
and
laughter
,
silver
clear
,
echoed
*NL*
and
reechoed
along
it
.
When
they
reached
the
hotel
it
was
a
blaze
of
*NL*
light
from
top
to
bottom
.
They
were
met
by
the
ladies
of
the
concert
*NL*
committee
,
one
of
whom
took
Anne
off
to
the
performers
'
dressing
room
*NL*
which
was
filled
with
the
members
of
a
Charlottetown
Symphony
Club
,
*NL*
among
whom
Anne
felt
suddenly
shy
and
frightened
and
countrified
.
Her
*NL*
dress
,
which
,
in
the
east
gable
,
had
seemed
so
dainty
and
pretty
,
now
*NL*
seemed
simple
and
plain
--
too
simple
and
plain
,
she
thought
,
among
all
*NL*
the
silks
and
laces
that
glistened
and
rustled
around
her
.
What
were
her
*NL*
pearl
beads
compared
to
the
diamonds
of
the
big
,
handsome
lady
near
her
?
*NL*
And
how
poor
her
one
wee
white
rose
must
look
beside
all
the
hothouse
*NL*
flowers
the
others
wore
!
Anne
laid
her
hat
and
jacket
away
,
and
shrank
*NL*
miserably
into
a
corner
.
She
wished
herself
back
in
the
white
room
at
*NL*
Green
Gables
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
worse
on
the
platform
of
the
big
concert
hall
of
the
hotel
,
*NL*
where
she
presently
found
herself
.
The
electric
lights
dazzled
her
eyes
,
*NL*
the
perfume
and
hum
bewildered
her
.
She
wished
she
were
sitting
down
*NL*
in
the
audience
with
Diana
and
Jane
,
who
seemed
to
be
having
a
splendid
*NL*
time
away
at
the
back
.
She
was
wedged
in
between
a
stout
lady
in
pink
*NL*
silk
and
a
tall
,
scornful-looking
girl
in
a
white-lace
dress
.
The
stout
*NL*
lady
occasionally
turned
her
head
squarely
around
and
surveyed
Anne
*NL*
through
her
eyeglasses
until
Anne
,
acutely
sensitive
of
being
so
*NL*
scrutinized
,
felt
that
she
must
scream
aloud
;
and
the
white-lace
girl
*NL*
kept
talking
audibly
to
her
next
neighbor
about
the
``
country
bumpkins
''
*NL*
and
``
rustic
belles
''
in
the
audience
,
languidly
anticipating
``
such
fun
''
*NL*
from
the
displays
of
local
talent
on
the
program
.
Anne
believed
that
she
*NL*
would
hate
that
white-lace
girl
to
the
end
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
for
Anne
,
a
professional
elocutionist
was
staying
at
the
*NL*
hotel
and
had
consented
to
recite
.
She
was
a
lithe
,
dark-eyed
woman
in
a
*NL*
wonderful
gown
of
shimmering
gray
stuff
like
woven
moonbeams
,
with
gems
*NL*
on
her
neck
and
in
her
dark
hair
.
She
had
a
marvelously
flexible
voice
*NL*
and
wonderful
power
of
expression
;
the
audience
went
wild
over
her
*NL*
selection
.
Anne
,
forgetting
all
about
herself
and
her
troubles
for
the
*NL*
time
,
listened
with
rapt
and
shining
eyes
;
but
when
the
recitation
ended
*NL*
she
suddenly
put
her
hands
over
her
face
.
She
could
never
get
up
and
*NL*
recite
after
that
--
never
.
Had
she
ever
thought
she
could
recite
?
Oh
,
if
*NL*
she
were
only
back
at
Green
Gables
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
unpropitious
moment
her
name
was
called
.
Somehow
Anne
--
who
did
*NL*
not
notice
the
rather
guilty
little
start
of
surprise
the
white-lace
*NL*
girl
gave
,
and
would
not
have
understood
the
subtle
compliment
implied
*NL*
therein
if
she
had
--
got
on
her
feet
,
and
moved
dizzily
out
to
the
front
.
*NL*
She
was
so
pale
that
Diana
and
Jane
,
down
in
the
audience
,
clasped
each
*NL*
other
's
hands
in
nervous
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
the
victim
of
an
overwhelming
attack
of
stage
fright
.
Often
as
*NL*
she
had
recited
in
public
,
she
had
never
before
faced
such
an
audience
*NL*
as
this
,
and
the
sight
of
it
paralyzed
her
energies
completely
.
*NL*
Everything
was
so
strange
,
so
brilliant
,
so
bewildering
--
the
rows
of
*NL*
ladies
in
evening
dress
,
the
critical
faces
,
the
whole
atmosphere
of
*NL*
wealth
and
culture
about
her
.
Very
different
this
from
the
plain
benches
*NL*
at
the
Debating
Club
,
filled
with
the
homely
,
sympathetic
faces
of
*NL*
friends
and
neighbors
.
These
people
,
she
thought
,
would
be
merciless
*NL*
critics
.
Perhaps
,
like
the
white-lace
girl
,
they
anticipated
amusement
*NL*
from
her
``
rustic
''
efforts
.
She
felt
hopelessly
,
helplessly
ashamed
and
*NL*
miserable
.
Her
knees
trembled
,
her
heart
fluttered
,
a
horrible
faintness
*NL*
came
over
her
;
not
a
word
could
she
utter
,
and
the
next
moment
she
would
*NL*
have
fled
from
the
platform
despite
the
humiliation
which
,
she
felt
,
*NL*
must
ever
after
be
her
portion
if
she
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
,
as
her
dilated
,
frightened
eyes
gazed
out
over
the
*NL*
audience
,
she
saw
Gilbert
Blythe
away
at
the
back
of
the
room
,
bending
*NL*
forward
with
a
smile
on
his
face
--
a
smile
which
seemed
to
Anne
at
once
*NL*
triumphant
and
taunting
.
In
reality
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
.
Gilbert
*NL*
was
merely
smiling
with
appreciation
of
the
whole
affair
in
general
and
*NL*
of
the
effect
produced
by
Anne
's
slender
white
form
and
spiritual
face
*NL*
against
a
background
of
palms
in
particular
.
Josie
Pye
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
driven
over
,
sat
beside
him
,
and
her
face
certainly
was
both
triumphant
*NL*
and
taunting
.
But
Anne
did
not
see
Josie
,
and
would
not
have
cared
if
*NL*
she
had
.
She
drew
a
long
breath
and
flung
her
head
up
proudly
,
courage
*NL*
and
determination
tingling
over
her
like
an
electric
shock
.
She
WOULD
*NL*
NOT
fail
before
Gilbert
Blythe
--
he
should
never
be
able
to
laugh
at
her
,
*NL*
never
,
never
!
Her
fright
and
nervousness
vanished
;
and
she
began
her
*NL*
recitation
,
her
clear
,
sweet
voice
reaching
to
the
farthest
corner
of
*NL*
the
room
without
a
tremor
or
a
break
.
Self-possession
was
fully
restored
*NL*
to
her
,
and
in
the
reaction
from
that
horrible
moment
of
powerlessness
*NL*
she
recited
as
she
had
never
done
before
.
When
she
finished
there
were
*NL*
bursts
of
honest
applause
.
Anne
,
stepping
back
to
her
seat
,
blushing
*NL*
with
shyness
and
delight
,
found
her
hand
vigorously
clasped
and
shaken
*NL*
by
the
stout
lady
in
pink
silk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
did
splendidly
,
''
she
puffed
.
``
I
've
been
crying
like
a
*NL*
baby
,
actually
I
have
.
There
,
they
're
encoring
you
--
they
're
bound
to
*NL*
have
you
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
go
,
''
said
Anne
confusedly
.
``
But
yet
--
I
must
,
or
Matthew
*NL*
will
be
disappointed
.
He
said
they
would
encore
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
disappoint
Matthew
,
''
said
the
pink
lady
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
,
blushing
,
limpid
eyed
,
Anne
tripped
back
and
gave
a
quaint
,
*NL*
funny
little
selection
that
captivated
her
audience
still
further
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
the
evening
was
quite
a
little
triumph
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
concert
was
over
,
the
stout
,
pink
lady
--
who
was
the
wife
of
*NL*
an
American
millionaire
--
took
her
under
her
wing
,
and
introduced
her
*NL*
to
everybody
;
and
everybody
was
very
nice
to
her
.
The
professional
*NL*
elocutionist
,
Mrs.
Evans
,
came
and
chatted
with
her
,
telling
her
that
*NL*
she
had
a
charming
voice
and
``
interpreted
''
her
selections
beautifully
.
*NL*
Even
the
white-lace
girl
paid
her
a
languid
little
compliment
.
They
had
*NL*
supper
in
the
big
,
beautifully
decorated
dining
room
;
Diana
and
Jane
*NL*
were
invited
to
partake
of
this
,
also
,
since
they
had
come
with
Anne
,
*NL*
but
Billy
was
nowhere
to
be
found
,
having
decamped
in
mortal
fear
*NL*
of
some
such
invitation
.
He
was
in
waiting
for
them
,
with
the
team
,
*NL*
however
,
when
it
was
all
over
,
and
the
three
girls
came
merrily
out
into
*NL*
the
calm
,
white
moonshine
radiance
.
Anne
breathed
deeply
,
and
looked
*NL*
into
the
clear
sky
beyond
the
dark
boughs
of
the
firs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
it
was
good
to
be
out
again
in
the
purity
and
silence
of
the
night
!
*NL*
How
great
and
still
and
wonderful
everything
was
,
with
the
murmur
of
the
*NL*
sea
sounding
through
it
and
the
darkling
cliffs
beyond
like
grim
giants
*NL*
guarding
enchanted
coasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
it
been
a
perfectly
splendid
time
?
''
sighed
Jane
,
as
they
drove
*NL*
away
.
``
I
just
wish
I
was
a
rich
American
and
could
spend
my
summer
at
*NL*
a
hotel
and
wear
jewels
and
low-necked
dresses
and
have
ice
cream
and
*NL*
chicken
salad
every
blessed
day
.
I
'm
sure
it
would
be
ever
so
much
*NL*
more
fun
than
teaching
school
.
Anne
,
your
recitation
was
simply
great
,
*NL*
although
I
thought
at
first
you
were
never
going
to
begin
.
I
think
it
*NL*
was
better
than
Mrs.
Evans
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
do
n't
say
things
like
that
,
Jane
,
''
said
Anne
quickly
,
``
because
*NL*
it
sounds
silly
.
It
could
n't
be
better
than
Mrs.
Evans
's
,
you
know
,
for
*NL*
she
is
a
professional
,
and
I
'm
only
a
schoolgirl
,
with
a
little
knack
*NL*
of
reciting
.
I
'm
quite
satisfied
if
the
people
just
liked
mine
pretty
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
a
compliment
for
you
,
Anne
,
''
said
Diana
.
``
At
least
I
think
it
*NL*
must
be
a
compliment
because
of
the
tone
he
said
it
in
.
Part
of
it
*NL*
was
anyhow
.
There
was
an
American
sitting
behind
Jane
and
me
--
such
a
*NL*
romantic-looking
man
,
with
coal-black
hair
and
eyes
.
Josie
Pye
says
he
*NL*
is
a
distinguished
artist
,
and
that
her
mother
's
cousin
in
Boston
is
*NL*
married
to
a
man
that
used
to
go
to
school
with
him
.
Well
,
we
heard
*NL*
him
say
--
did
n't
we
,
Jane
?
--
`
Who
is
that
girl
on
the
platform
with
the
*NL*
splendid
Titian
hair
?
She
has
a
face
I
should
like
to
paint
.
'
There
now
,
*NL*
Anne
.
But
what
does
Titian
hair
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
interpreted
it
means
plain
red
,
I
guess
,
''
laughed
Anne
.
``
Titian
*NL*
was
a
very
famous
artist
who
liked
to
paint
red-haired
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
DID
you
see
all
the
diamonds
those
ladies
wore
?
''
sighed
Jane
.
``
They
*NL*
were
simply
dazzling
.
Would
n't
you
just
love
to
be
rich
,
girls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ARE
rich
,
''
said
Anne
staunchly
.
``
Why
,
we
have
sixteen
years
to
our
*NL*
credit
,
and
we
're
happy
as
queens
,
and
we
've
all
got
imaginations
,
more
*NL*
or
less
.
Look
at
that
sea
,
girls
--
all
silver
and
shadow
and
vision
of
*NL*
things
not
seen
.
We
could
n't
enjoy
its
loveliness
any
more
if
we
had
*NL*
millions
of
dollars
and
ropes
of
diamonds
.
You
would
n't
change
into
any
*NL*
of
those
women
if
you
could
.
Would
you
want
to
be
that
white-lace
girl
*NL*
and
wear
a
sour
look
all
your
life
,
as
if
you
'd
been
born
turning
up
*NL*
your
nose
at
the
world
?
Or
the
pink
lady
,
kind
and
nice
as
she
is
,
so
*NL*
stout
and
short
that
you
'd
really
no
figure
at
all
?
Or
even
Mrs.
Evans
,
*NL*
with
that
sad
,
sad
look
in
her
eyes
?
She
must
have
been
dreadfully
*NL*
unhappy
sometime
to
have
such
a
look
.
You
KNOW
you
would
n't
,
Jane
*NL*
Andrews
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
DO
N'T
know
--
exactly
,
''
said
Jane
unconvinced
.
``
I
think
diamonds
would
*NL*
comfort
a
person
for
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
want
to
be
anyone
but
myself

even
if
I
go
uncomforted
by

diamonds
all
my
life

declared
Anne
.
``
I
'm
quite
content
to
be
Anne
of

Green
Gables

with
my
string
of
pearl

CHAPTER
XXXIV
.
A
Queen
's
Girl
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
three
weeks
were
busy
ones
at
Green
Gables
,
for
Anne
was
*NL*
getting
ready
to
go
to
Queen
's
,
and
there
was
much
sewing
to
be
done
,
*NL*
and
many
things
to
be
talked
over
and
arranged
.
Anne
's
outfit
was
*NL*
ample
and
pretty
,
for
Matthew
saw
to
that
,
and
Marilla
for
once
made
*NL*
no
objections
whatever
to
anything
he
purchased
or
suggested
.
More
--
one
*NL*
evening
she
went
up
to
the
east
gable
with
her
arms
full
of
a
delicate
*NL*
pale
green
material
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
here
's
something
for
a
nice
light
dress
for
you
.
I
do
n't
suppose
*NL*
you
really
need
it
;
you
've
plenty
of
pretty
waists
;
but
I
thought
maybe
*NL*
you
'd
like
something
real
dressy
to
wear
if
you
were
asked
out
anywhere
*NL*
of
an
evening
in
town
,
to
a
party
or
anything
like
that
.
I
hear
that
*NL*
Jane
and
Ruby
and
Josie
have
got
`
evening
dresses
,
'
as
they
call
them
,
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
mean
you
shall
be
behind
them
.
I
got
Mrs.
Allan
to
help
me
*NL*
pick
it
in
town
last
week
,
and
we
'll
get
Emily
Gillis
to
make
it
for
*NL*
you
.
Emily
has
got
taste
,
and
her
fits
are
n't
to
be
equaled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
it
's
just
lovely
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
Thank
you
so
much
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
you
ought
to
be
so
kind
to
me
--
it
's
making
it
harder
every
day
*NL*
for
me
to
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
green
dress
was
made
up
with
as
many
tucks
and
frills
and
shirrings
*NL*
as
Emily
's
taste
permitted
.
Anne
put
it
on
one
evening
for
Matthew
's
*NL*
and
Marilla
's
benefit
,
and
recited
``
The
Maiden
's
Vow
''
for
them
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
As
Marilla
watched
the
bright
,
animated
face
and
graceful
*NL*
motions
her
thoughts
went
back
to
the
evening
Anne
had
arrived
at
Green
*NL*
Gables
,
and
memory
recalled
a
vivid
picture
of
the
odd
,
frightened
child
*NL*
in
her
preposterous
yellowish-brown
wincey
dress
,
the
heartbreak
looking
*NL*
out
of
her
tearful
eyes
.
Something
in
the
memory
brought
tears
to
*NL*
Marilla
's
own
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
my
recitation
has
made
you
cry
,
Marilla
,
''
said
Anne
gaily
*NL*
stooping
over
Marilla
's
chair
to
drop
a
butterfly
kiss
on
that
lady
's
*NL*
cheek
.
``
Now
,
I
call
that
a
positive
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
n't
crying
over
your
piece
,
''
said
Marilla
,
who
would
have
*NL*
scorned
to
be
betrayed
into
such
weakness
by
any
poetry
stuff
.
``
I
just
*NL*
could
n't
help
thinking
of
the
little
girl
you
used
to
be
,
Anne
.
And
*NL*
I
was
wishing
you
could
have
stayed
a
little
girl
,
even
with
all
your
*NL*
queer
ways
.
You
've
grown
up
now
and
you
're
going
away
;
and
you
look
so
*NL*
tall
and
stylish
and
so
--
so
--
different
altogether
in
that
dress
--
as
if
*NL*
you
did
n't
belong
in
Avonlea
at
all
--
and
I
just
got
lonesome
thinking
it
*NL*
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
!
''
Anne
sat
down
on
Marilla
's
gingham
lap
,
took
Marilla
's
lined
*NL*
face
between
her
hands
,
and
looked
gravely
and
tenderly
into
Marilla
's
*NL*
eyes
.
``
I
'm
not
a
bit
changed
--
not
really
.
I
'm
only
just
pruned
down
and
*NL*
branched
out
.
The
real
ME
--
back
here
--
is
just
the
same
.
It
wo
n't
make
a
*NL*
bit
of
difference
where
I
go
or
how
much
I
change
outwardly
;
at
heart
I
*NL*
shall
always
be
your
little
Anne
,
who
will
love
you
and
Matthew
and
dear
*NL*
Green
Gables
more
and
better
every
day
of
her
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
laid
her
fresh
young
cheek
against
Marilla
's
faded
one
,
and
reached
*NL*
out
a
hand
to
pat
Matthew
's
shoulder
.
Marilla
would
have
given
much
just
*NL*
then
to
have
possessed
Anne
's
power
of
putting
her
feelings
into
words
;
*NL*
but
nature
and
habit
had
willed
it
otherwise
,
and
she
could
only
put
her
*NL*
arms
close
about
her
girl
and
hold
her
tenderly
to
her
heart
,
wishing
*NL*
that
she
need
never
let
her
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
,
with
a
suspicious
moisture
in
his
eyes
,
got
up
and
went
*NL*
out-of-doors
.
Under
the
stars
of
the
blue
summer
night
he
walked
*NL*
agitatedly
across
the
yard
to
the
gate
under
the
poplars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
guess
she
ai
n't
been
much
spoiled
,
''
he
muttered
,
proudly
.
*NL*
``
I
guess
my
putting
in
my
oar
occasional
never
did
much
harm
after
all
.
*NL*
She
's
smart
and
pretty
,
and
loving
,
too
,
which
is
better
than
all
the
*NL*
rest
.
She
's
been
a
blessing
to
us
,
and
there
never
was
a
luckier
mistake
*NL*
than
what
Mrs.
Spencer
made
--
if
it
WAS
luck
.
I
do
n't
believe
it
was
any
*NL*
such
thing
.
It
was
Providence
,
because
the
Almighty
saw
we
needed
her
,
I
*NL*
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
finally
came
when
Anne
must
go
to
town
.
She
and
Matthew
drove
*NL*
in
one
fine
September
morning
,
after
a
tearful
parting
with
Diana
and
an
*NL*
untearful
practical
one
--
on
Marilla
's
side
at
least
--
with
Marilla
.
But
*NL*
when
Anne
had
gone
Diana
dried
her
tears
and
went
to
a
beach
picnic
at
*NL*
White
Sands
with
some
of
her
Carmody
cousins
,
where
she
contrived
*NL*
to
enjoy
herself
tolerably
well
;
while
Marilla
plunged
fiercely
into
*NL*
unnecessary
work
and
kept
at
it
all
day
long
with
the
bitterest
kind
of
*NL*
heartache
--
the
ache
that
burns
and
gnaws
and
can
not
wash
itself
away
*NL*
in
ready
tears
.
But
that
night
,
when
Marilla
went
to
bed
,
acutely
and
*NL*
miserably
conscious
that
the
little
gable
room
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
hall
was
untenanted
by
any
vivid
young
life
and
unstirred
by
any
soft
*NL*
breathing
,
she
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
,
and
wept
for
her
girl
in
*NL*
a
passion
of
sobs
that
appalled
her
when
she
grew
calm
enough
to
reflect
*NL*
how
very
wicked
it
must
be
to
take
on
so
about
a
sinful
fellow
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
and
the
rest
of
the
Avonlea
scholars
reached
town
just
in
time
to
*NL*
hurry
off
to
the
Academy
.
That
first
day
passed
pleasantly
enough
in
a
*NL*
whirl
of
excitement
,
meeting
all
the
new
students
,
learning
to
know
the
*NL*
professors
by
sight
and
being
assorted
and
organized
into
classes
.
Anne
*NL*
intended
taking
up
the
Second
Year
work
being
advised
to
do
so
by
Miss
*NL*
Stacy
;
Gilbert
Blythe
elected
to
do
the
same
.
This
meant
getting
a
*NL*
First
Class
teacher
's
license
in
one
year
instead
of
two
,
if
they
were
*NL*
successful
;
but
it
also
meant
much
more
and
harder
work
.
Jane
,
Ruby
,
*NL*
Josie
,
Charlie
,
and
Moody
Spurgeon
,
not
being
troubled
with
the
*NL*
stirrings
of
ambition
,
were
content
to
take
up
the
Second
Class
work
.
*NL*
Anne
was
conscious
of
a
pang
of
loneliness
when
she
found
herself
in
*NL*
a
room
with
fifty
other
students
,
not
one
of
whom
she
knew
,
except
the
*NL*
tall
,
brown-haired
boy
across
the
room
;
and
knowing
him
in
the
fashion
*NL*
she
did
,
did
not
help
her
much
,
as
she
reflected
pessimistically
.
*NL*
Yet
she
was
undeniably
glad
that
they
were
in
the
same
class
;
the
old
*NL*
rivalry
could
still
be
carried
on
,
and
Anne
would
hardly
have
known
what
*NL*
to
do
if
it
had
been
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
feel
comfortable
without
it
,
''
she
thought
.
``
Gilbert
looks
*NL*
awfully
determined
.
I
suppose
he
's
making
up
his
mind
,
here
and
now
,
to
*NL*
win
the
medal
.
What
a
splendid
chin
he
has
!
I
never
noticed
it
before
.
*NL*
I
do
wish
Jane
and
Ruby
had
gone
in
for
First
Class
,
too
.
I
suppose
I
*NL*
wo
n't
feel
so
much
like
a
cat
in
a
strange
garret
when
I
get
acquainted
,
*NL*
though
.
I
wonder
which
of
the
girls
here
are
going
to
be
my
friends
.
*NL*
It
's
really
an
interesting
speculation
.
Of
course
I
promised
Diana
that
*NL*
no
Queen
's
girl
,
no
matter
how
much
I
liked
her
,
should
ever
be
as
dear
*NL*
to
me
as
she
is
;
but
I
've
lots
of
second-best
affections
to
bestow
.
I
*NL*
like
the
look
of
that
girl
with
the
brown
eyes
and
the
crimson
waist
.
*NL*
She
looks
vivid
and
red-rosy
;
there
's
that
pale
,
fair
one
gazing
out
of
*NL*
the
window
.
She
has
lovely
hair
,
and
looks
as
if
she
knew
a
thing
or
two
*NL*
about
dreams
.
I
'd
like
to
know
them
both
--
know
them
well
--
well
enough
to
*NL*
walk
with
my
arm
about
their
waists
,
and
call
them
nicknames
.
But
just
*NL*
now
I
do
n't
know
them
and
they
do
n't
know
me
,
and
probably
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
know
me
particularly
.
Oh
,
it
's
lonesome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
lonesomer
still
when
Anne
found
herself
alone
in
her
hall
bedroom
*NL*
that
night
at
twilight
.
She
was
not
to
board
with
the
other
girls
,
who
*NL*
all
had
relatives
in
town
to
take
pity
on
them
.
Miss
Josephine
Barry
*NL*
would
have
liked
to
board
her
,
but
Beechwood
was
so
far
from
the
*NL*
Academy
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
;
so
Miss
Barry
hunted
up
a
*NL*
boarding-house
,
assuring
Matthew
and
Marilla
that
it
was
the
very
place
*NL*
for
Anne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
who
keeps
it
is
a
reduced
gentlewoman
,
''
explained
Miss
Barry
.
*NL*
``
Her
husband
was
a
British
officer
,
and
she
is
very
careful
what
sort
*NL*
of
boarders
she
takes
.
Anne
will
not
meet
with
any
objectionable
persons
*NL*
under
her
roof
.
The
table
is
good
,
and
the
house
is
near
the
Academy
,
in
*NL*
a
quiet
neighborhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
might
be
quite
true
,
and
indeed
,
proved
to
be
so
,
but
it
did
*NL*
not
materially
help
Anne
in
the
first
agony
of
homesickness
that
seized
*NL*
upon
her
.
She
looked
dismally
about
her
narrow
little
room
,
with
its
*NL*
dull-papered
,
pictureless
walls
,
its
small
iron
bedstead
and
empty
*NL*
book-case
;
and
a
horrible
choke
came
into
her
throat
as
she
thought
of
*NL*
her
own
white
room
at
Green
Gables
,
where
she
would
have
the
pleasant
*NL*
consciousness
of
a
great
green
still
outdoors
,
of
sweet
peas
growing
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
moonlight
falling
on
the
orchard
,
of
the
brook
below
the
*NL*
slope
and
the
spruce
boughs
tossing
in
the
night
wind
beyond
it
,
of
a
*NL*
vast
starry
sky
,
and
the
light
from
Diana
's
window
shining
out
through
*NL*
the
gap
in
the
trees
.
Here
there
was
nothing
of
this
;
Anne
knew
that
*NL*
outside
of
her
window
was
a
hard
street
,
with
a
network
of
telephone
*NL*
wires
shutting
out
the
sky
,
the
tramp
of
alien
feet
,
and
a
thousand
*NL*
lights
gleaming
on
stranger
faces
.
She
knew
that
she
was
going
to
cry
,
*NL*
and
fought
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
WO
N'T
cry
.
It
's
silly
--
and
weak
--
there
's
the
third
tear
splashing
*NL*
down
by
my
nose
.
There
are
more
coming
!
I
must
think
of
something
funny
*NL*
to
stop
them
.
But
there
's
nothing
funny
except
what
is
connected
with
*NL*
Avonlea
,
and
that
only
makes
things
worse
--
four
--
five
--
I
'm
going
home
*NL*
next
Friday
,
but
that
seems
a
hundred
years
away
.
Oh
,
Matthew
is
nearly
*NL*
home
by
now
--
and
Marilla
is
at
the
gate
,
looking
down
the
lane
for
*NL*
him
--
six
--
seven
--
eight
--
oh
,
there
's
no
use
in
counting
them
!
They
're
*NL*
coming
in
a
flood
presently
.
I
ca
n't
cheer
up
--
I
do
n't
WANT
to
cheer
up
.
*NL*
It
's
nicer
to
be
miserable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
flood
of
tears
would
have
come
,
no
doubt
,
had
not
Josie
Pye
appeared
*NL*
at
that
moment
.
In
the
joy
of
seeing
a
familiar
face
Anne
forgot
that
*NL*
there
had
never
been
much
love
lost
between
her
and
Josie
.
As
a
part
of
*NL*
Avonlea
life
even
a
Pye
was
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
you
came
up
,
''
Anne
said
sincerely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
crying
,
''
remarked
Josie
,
with
aggravating
pity
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
you
're
homesick
--
some
people
have
so
little
self-control
in
that
*NL*
respect
.
I
've
no
intention
of
being
homesick
,
I
can
tell
you
.
Town
's
too
*NL*
jolly
after
that
poky
old
Avonlea
.
I
wonder
how
I
ever
existed
there
so
*NL*
long
.
You
should
n't
cry
,
Anne
;
it
is
n't
becoming
,
for
your
nose
and
eyes
*NL*
get
red
,
and
then
you
seem
ALL
red
.
I
'd
a
perfectly
scrumptious
time
in
*NL*
the
Academy
today
.
Our
French
professor
is
simply
a
duck
.
His
moustache
*NL*
would
give
you
kerwollowps
of
the
heart
.
Have
you
anything
eatable
*NL*
around
,
Anne
?
I
'm
literally
starving
.
Ah
,
I
guessed
likely
Marilla
'd
*NL*
load
you
up
with
cake
.
That
's
why
I
called
round
.
Otherwise
I
'd
have
*NL*
gone
to
the
park
to
hear
the
band
play
with
Frank
Stockley
.
He
boards
*NL*
same
place
as
I
do
,
and
he
's
a
sport
.
He
noticed
you
in
class
today
,
and
*NL*
asked
me
who
the
red-headed
girl
was
.
I
told
him
you
were
an
orphan
that
*NL*
the
Cuthberts
had
adopted
,
and
nobody
knew
very
much
about
what
you
'd
*NL*
been
before
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
was
wondering
if
,
after
all
,
solitude
and
tears
were
not
more
*NL*
satisfactory
than
Josie
Pye
's
companionship
when
Jane
and
Ruby
appeared
,
*NL*
each
with
an
inch
of
Queen
's
color
ribbon
--
purple
and
scarlet
--
pinned
*NL*
proudly
to
her
coat
.
As
Josie
was
not
``
speaking
''
to
Jane
just
then
she
*NL*
had
to
subside
into
comparative
harmlessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Jane
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
feel
as
if
I
'd
lived
many
moons
since
*NL*
the
morning
.
I
ought
to
be
home
studying
my
Virgil
--
that
horrid
old
*NL*
professor
gave
us
twenty
lines
to
start
in
on
tomorrow
.
But
I
simply
*NL*
could
n't
settle
down
to
study
tonight
.
Anne
,
methinks
I
see
the
*NL*
traces
of
tears
.
If
you
've
been
crying
DO
own
up
.
It
will
restore
my
*NL*
self-respect
,
for
I
was
shedding
tears
freely
before
Ruby
came
along
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
being
a
goose
so
much
if
somebody
else
is
goosey
,
too
.
Cake
?
*NL*
You
'll
give
me
a
teeny
piece
,
wo
n't
you
?
Thank
you
.
It
has
the
real
*NL*
Avonlea
flavor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ruby
,
perceiving
the
Queen
's
calendar
lying
on
the
table
,
wanted
to
know
*NL*
if
Anne
meant
to
try
for
the
gold
medal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
blushed
and
admitted
she
was
thinking
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
reminds
me
,
''
said
Josie
,
``
Queen
's
is
to
get
one
of
the
Avery
*NL*
scholarships
after
all
.
The
word
came
today
.
Frank
Stockley
told
me
--
his
*NL*
uncle
is
one
of
the
board
of
governors
,
you
know
.
It
will
be
announced
*NL*
in
the
Academy
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
Avery
scholarship
!
Anne
felt
her
heart
beat
more
quickly
,
and
the
*NL*
horizons
of
her
ambition
shifted
and
broadened
as
if
by
magic
.
Before
*NL*
Josie
had
told
the
news
Anne
's
highest
pinnacle
of
aspiration
had
been
*NL*
a
teacher
's
provincial
license
,
First
Class
,
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
the
medal
!
But
now
in
one
moment
Anne
saw
herself
winning
*NL*
the
Avery
scholarship
,
taking
an
Arts
course
at
Redmond
College
,
and
*NL*
graduating
in
a
gown
and
mortar
board
,
before
the
echo
of
Josie
's
words
*NL*
had
died
away
.
For
the
Avery
scholarship
was
in
English
,
and
Anne
felt
*NL*
that
here
her
foot
was
on
native
heath
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wealthy
manufacturer
of
New
Brunswick
had
died
and
left
part
of
his
*NL*
fortune
to
endow
a
large
number
of
scholarships
to
be
distributed
*NL*
among
the
various
high
schools
and
academies
of
the
Maritime
Provinces
,
*NL*
according
to
their
respective
standings
.
There
had
been
much
doubt
*NL*
whether
one
would
be
allotted
to
Queen
's
,
but
the
matter
was
settled
at
*NL*
last
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
graduate
who
made
the
highest
mark
*NL*
in
English
and
English
Literature
would
win
the
scholarship
--
two
hundred
*NL*
and
fifty
dollars
a
year
for
four
years
at
Redmond
College
.
No
wonder
*NL*
that
Anne
went
to
bed
that
night
with
tingling
cheeks
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
win
that
scholarship
if
hard
work
can
do
it
,
''
she
resolved
.
*NL*
``
Would
n't
Matthew
be
proud
if
I
got
to
be
a
B.A.
?
Oh
,
it
's
delightful
to
*NL*
have
ambitions
.
I
'm
so
glad
I
have
such
a
lot
.
And
there
never
seems
to
*NL*
be
any
end
to
them
--
that
's
the
best
of
it
.
Just
as
soon
as
you
attain
*NL*
to
one
ambition
you
see
another
one
glittering
higher
up
still
.
It
does
*NL*
make
life
so
interesting

CHAPTER
XXXV
.
The
Winter
at
Queen
's
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
homesickness
wore
off
,
greatly
helped
in
the
wearing
by
her
*NL*
weekend
visits
home
.
As
long
as
the
open
weather
lasted
the
Avonlea
*NL*
students
went
out
to
Carmody
on
the
new
branch
railway
every
Friday
*NL*
night
.
Diana
and
several
other
Avonlea
young
folks
were
generally
on
*NL*
hand
to
meet
them
and
they
all
walked
over
to
Avonlea
in
a
merry
party
.
*NL*
Anne
thought
those
Friday
evening
gypsyings
over
the
autumnal
hills
in
*NL*
the
crisp
golden
air
,
with
the
homelights
of
Avonlea
twinkling
beyond
,
*NL*
were
the
best
and
dearest
hours
in
the
whole
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
nearly
always
walked
with
Ruby
Gillis
and
carried
her
*NL*
satchel
for
her
.
Ruby
was
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
now
thinking
*NL*
herself
quite
as
grown
up
as
she
really
was
;
she
wore
her
skirts
as
long
*NL*
as
her
mother
would
let
her
and
did
her
hair
up
in
town
,
though
she
had
*NL*
to
take
it
down
when
she
went
home
.
She
had
large
,
bright-blue
eyes
,
*NL*
a
brilliant
complexion
,
and
a
plump
showy
figure
.
She
laughed
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
was
cheerful
and
good-tempered
,
and
enjoyed
the
pleasant
things
of
*NL*
life
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
should
n't
think
she
was
the
sort
of
girl
Gilbert
would
like
,
''
*NL*
whispered
Jane
to
Anne
.
Anne
did
not
think
so
either
,
but
she
would
not
*NL*
have
said
so
for
the
Avery
scholarship
.
She
could
not
help
thinking
,
*NL*
too
,
that
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
have
such
a
friend
as
Gilbert
*NL*
to
jest
and
chatter
with
and
exchange
ideas
about
books
and
studies
and
*NL*
ambitions
.
Gilbert
had
ambitions
,
she
knew
,
and
Ruby
Gillis
did
not
seem
*NL*
the
sort
of
person
with
whom
such
could
be
profitably
discussed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
silly
sentiment
in
Anne
's
ideas
concerning
Gilbert
.
Boys
*NL*
were
to
her
,
when
she
thought
about
them
at
all
,
merely
possible
good
*NL*
comrades
.
If
she
and
Gilbert
had
been
friends
she
would
not
have
cared
*NL*
how
many
other
friends
he
had
nor
with
whom
he
walked
.
She
had
a
genius
*NL*
for
friendship
;
girl
friends
she
had
in
plenty
;
but
she
had
a
vague
*NL*
consciousness
that
masculine
friendship
might
also
be
a
good
thing
*NL*
to
round
out
one
's
conceptions
of
companionship
and
furnish
broader
*NL*
standpoints
of
judgment
and
comparison
.
Not
that
Anne
could
have
put
her
*NL*
feelings
on
the
matter
into
just
such
clear
definition
.
But
she
thought
*NL*
that
if
Gilbert
had
ever
walked
home
with
her
from
the
train
,
over
the
*NL*
crisp
fields
and
along
the
ferny
byways
,
they
might
have
had
many
and
*NL*
merry
and
interesting
conversations
about
the
new
world
that
was
opening
*NL*
around
them
and
their
hopes
and
ambitions
therein
.
Gilbert
was
a
clever
*NL*
young
fellow
,
with
his
own
thoughts
about
things
and
a
determination
to
*NL*
get
the
best
out
of
life
and
put
the
best
into
it
.
Ruby
Gillis
told
Jane
*NL*
Andrews
that
she
did
n't
understand
half
the
things
Gilbert
Blythe
said
;
*NL*
he
talked
just
like
Anne
Shirley
did
when
she
had
a
thoughtful
fit
on
*NL*
and
for
her
part
she
did
n't
think
it
any
fun
to
be
bothering
about
books
*NL*
and
that
sort
of
thing
when
you
did
n't
have
to
.
Frank
Stockley
had
lots
*NL*
more
dash
and
go
,
but
then
he
was
n't
half
as
good-looking
as
Gilbert
and
*NL*
she
really
could
n't
decide
which
she
liked
best
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Academy
Anne
gradually
drew
a
little
circle
of
friends
about
*NL*
her
,
thoughtful
,
imaginative
,
ambitious
students
like
herself
.
With
the
*NL*
``
rose-red
''
girl
,
Stella
Maynard
,
and
the
``
dream
girl
,
''
Priscilla
Grant
,
*NL*
she
soon
became
intimate
,
finding
the
latter
pale
spiritual-looking
*NL*
maiden
to
be
full
to
the
brim
of
mischief
and
pranks
and
fun
,
while
the
*NL*
vivid
,
black-eyed
Stella
had
a
heartful
of
wistful
dreams
and
fancies
,
*NL*
as
aerial
and
rainbow-like
as
Anne
's
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
Christmas
holidays
the
Avonlea
students
gave
up
going
home
*NL*
on
Fridays
and
settled
down
to
hard
work
.
By
this
time
all
the
Queen
's
*NL*
scholars
had
gravitated
into
their
own
places
in
the
ranks
and
*NL*
the
various
classes
had
assumed
distinct
and
settled
shadings
of
*NL*
individuality
.
Certain
facts
had
become
generally
accepted
.
It
was
*NL*
admitted
that
the
medal
contestants
had
practically
narrowed
down
*NL*
to
three
--
Gilbert
Blythe
,
Anne
Shirley
,
and
Lewis
Wilson
;
the
Avery
*NL*
scholarship
was
more
doubtful
,
any
one
of
a
certain
six
being
a
possible
*NL*
winner
.
The
bronze
medal
for
mathematics
was
considered
as
good
as
*NL*
won
by
a
fat
,
funny
little
up-country
boy
with
a
bumpy
forehead
and
a
*NL*
patched
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ruby
Gillis
was
the
handsomest
girl
of
the
year
at
the
Academy
;
in
the
*NL*
Second
Year
classes
Stella
Maynard
carried
off
the
palm
for
beauty
,
with
*NL*
small
but
critical
minority
in
favor
of
Anne
Shirley
.
Ethel
Marr
was
*NL*
admitted
by
all
competent
judges
to
have
the
most
stylish
modes
*NL*
of
hair-dressing
,
and
Jane
Andrews
--
plain
,
plodding
,
conscientious
*NL*
Jane
--
carried
off
the
honors
in
the
domestic
science
course
.
Even
Josie
*NL*
Pye
attained
a
certain
preeminence
as
the
sharpest-tongued
young
lady
in
*NL*
attendance
at
Queen
's
.
So
it
may
be
fairly
stated
that
Miss
Stacy
's
old
*NL*
pupils
held
their
own
in
the
wider
arena
of
the
academical
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
worked
hard
and
steadily
.
Her
rivalry
with
Gilbert
was
as
intense
*NL*
as
it
had
ever
been
in
Avonlea
school
,
although
it
was
not
known
in
the
*NL*
class
at
large
,
but
somehow
the
bitterness
had
gone
out
of
it
.
Anne
no
*NL*
longer
wished
to
win
for
the
sake
of
defeating
Gilbert
;
rather
,
for
the
*NL*
proud
consciousness
of
a
well-won
victory
over
a
worthy
foeman
.
It
*NL*
would
be
worth
while
to
win
,
but
she
no
longer
thought
life
would
be
*NL*
insupportable
if
she
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
lessons
the
students
found
opportunities
for
pleasant
times
.
*NL*
Anne
spent
many
of
her
spare
hours
at
Beechwood
and
generally
ate
her
*NL*
Sunday
dinners
there
and
went
to
church
with
Miss
Barry
.
The
latter
was
,
*NL*
as
she
admitted
,
growing
old
,
but
her
black
eyes
were
not
dim
nor
the
*NL*
vigor
of
her
tongue
in
the
least
abated
.
But
she
never
sharpened
the
*NL*
latter
on
Anne
,
who
continued
to
be
a
prime
favorite
with
the
critical
*NL*
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Anne-girl
improves
all
the
time
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
get
tired
of
other
*NL*
girls
--
there
is
such
a
provoking
and
eternal
sameness
about
them
.
Anne
*NL*
has
as
many
shades
as
a
rainbow
and
every
shade
is
the
prettiest
while
*NL*
it
lasts
.
I
do
n't
know
that
she
is
as
amusing
as
she
was
when
she
was
*NL*
a
child
,
but
she
makes
me
love
her
and
I
like
people
who
make
me
love
*NL*
them
.
It
saves
me
so
much
trouble
in
making
myself
love
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
almost
before
anybody
realized
it
,
spring
had
come
;
out
in
*NL*
Avonlea
the
Mayflowers
were
peeping
pinkly
out
on
the
sere
barrens
where
*NL*
snow-wreaths
lingered
;
and
the
``
mist
of
green
''
was
on
the
woods
and
in
*NL*
the
valleys
.
But
in
Charlottetown
harassed
Queen
's
students
thought
and
*NL*
talked
only
of
examinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
seem
possible
that
the
term
is
nearly
over
,
''
said
Anne
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
last
fall
it
seemed
so
long
to
look
forward
to
--
a
whole
winter
*NL*
of
studies
and
classes
.
And
here
we
are
,
with
the
exams
looming
up
next
*NL*
week
.
Girls
,
sometimes
I
feel
as
if
those
exams
meant
everything
,
but
*NL*
when
I
look
at
the
big
buds
swelling
on
those
chestnut
trees
and
*NL*
the
misty
blue
air
at
the
end
of
the
streets
they
do
n't
seem
half
so
*NL*
important
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
and
Ruby
and
Josie
,
who
had
dropped
in
,
did
not
take
this
view
*NL*
of
it
.
To
them
the
coming
examinations
were
constantly
very
important
*NL*
indeed
--
far
more
important
than
chestnut
buds
or
Maytime
hazes
.
It
was
*NL*
all
very
well
for
Anne
,
who
was
sure
of
passing
at
least
,
to
have
her
*NL*
moments
of
belittling
them
,
but
when
your
whole
future
depended
on
*NL*
them
--
as
the
girls
truly
thought
theirs
did
--
you
could
not
regard
them
*NL*
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
lost
seven
pounds
in
the
last
two
weeks
,
''
sighed
Jane
.
``
It
's
no
*NL*
use
to
say
do
n't
worry
.
I
WILL
worry
.
Worrying
helps
you
some
--
it
*NL*
seems
as
if
you
were
doing
something
when
you
're
worrying
.
It
would
be
*NL*
dreadful
if
I
failed
to
get
my
license
after
going
to
Queen
's
all
winter
*NL*
and
spending
so
much
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Josie
Pye
.
``
If
I
do
n't
pass
this
year
I
'm
coming
*NL*
back
next
.
My
father
can
afford
to
send
me
.
Anne
,
Frank
Stockley
says
*NL*
that
Professor
Tremaine
said
Gilbert
Blythe
was
sure
to
get
the
medal
*NL*
and
that
Emily
Clay
would
likely
win
the
Avery
scholarship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
make
me
feel
badly
tomorrow
,
Josie
,
''
laughed
Anne
,
``
but
just
*NL*
now
I
honestly
feel
that
as
long
as
I
know
the
violets
are
coming
out
*NL*
all
purple
down
in
the
hollow
below
Green
Gables
and
that
little
ferns
*NL*
are
poking
their
heads
up
in
Lovers
'
Lane
,
it
's
not
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
difference
whether
I
win
the
Avery
or
not
.
I
've
done
my
best
and
I
begin
*NL*
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
`
joy
of
the
strife
.
'
Next
to
trying
*NL*
and
winning
,
the
best
thing
is
trying
and
failing
.
Girls
,
do
n't
talk
*NL*
about
exams
!
Look
at
that
arch
of
pale
green
sky
over
those
houses
*NL*
and
picture
to
yourself
what
it
must
look
like
over
the
purply-dark
*NL*
beech-woods
back
of
Avonlea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
wear
for
commencement
,
Jane
?
''
asked
Ruby
*NL*
practically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
and
Josie
both
answered
at
once
and
the
chatter
drifted
into
a
side
*NL*
eddy
of
fashions
.
But
Anne
,
with
her
elbows
on
the
window
sill
,
her
soft
*NL*
cheek
laid
against
her
clasped
hands
,
and
her
eyes
filled
with
visions
,
*NL*
looked
out
unheedingly
across
city
roof
and
spire
to
that
glorious
dome
*NL*
of
sunset
sky
and
wove
her
dreams
of
a
possible
future
from
the
golden
*NL*
tissue
of
youth
's
own
optimism
.
All
the
Beyond
was
hers
with
its
*NL*
possibilities
lurking
rosily
in
the
oncoming
years
--
each
year
a
rose
of
*NL*
promise
to
be
woven
into
an
immortal
chaplet

CHAPTER
XXXVI
.
The
Glory
and
the
Dream
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
when
the
final
results
of
all
the
examinations
were
to
be
*NL*
posted
on
the
bulletin
board
at
Queen
's
,
Anne
and
Jane
walked
down
the
*NL*
street
together
.
Jane
was
smiling
and
happy
;
examinations
were
over
*NL*
and
she
was
comfortably
sure
she
had
made
a
pass
at
least
;
further
*NL*
considerations
troubled
Jane
not
at
all
;
she
had
no
soaring
ambitions
*NL*
and
consequently
was
not
affected
with
the
unrest
attendant
thereon
.
For
*NL*
we
pay
a
price
for
everything
we
get
or
take
in
this
world
;
and
although
*NL*
ambitions
are
well
worth
having
,
they
are
not
to
be
cheaply
won
,
but
*NL*
exact
their
dues
of
work
and
self-denial
,
anxiety
and
discouragement
.
*NL*
Anne
was
pale
and
quiet
;
in
ten
more
minutes
she
would
know
who
had
*NL*
won
the
medal
and
who
the
Avery
.
Beyond
those
ten
minutes
there
did
not
*NL*
seem
,
just
then
,
to
be
anything
worth
being
called
Time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
'll
win
one
of
them
anyhow
,
''
said
Jane
,
who
could
n't
*NL*
understand
how
the
faculty
could
be
so
unfair
as
to
order
it
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
hope
of
the
Avery
,
''
said
Anne
.
``
Everybody
says
Emily
Clay
*NL*
will
win
it
.
And
I
'm
not
going
to
march
up
to
that
bulletin
board
and
*NL*
look
at
it
before
everybody
.
I
have
n't
the
moral
courage
.
I
'm
going
*NL*
straight
to
the
girls
'
dressing
room
.
You
must
read
the
announcements
*NL*
and
then
come
and
tell
me
,
Jane
.
And
I
implore
you
in
the
name
of
our
*NL*
old
friendship
to
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
.
If
I
have
failed
just
*NL*
say
so
,
without
trying
to
break
it
gently
;
and
whatever
you
do
DO
N'T
*NL*
sympathize
with
me
.
Promise
me
this
,
Jane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jane
promised
solemnly
;
but
,
as
it
happened
,
there
was
no
necessity
for
*NL*
such
a
promise
.
When
they
went
up
the
entrance
steps
of
Queen
's
they
*NL*
found
the
hall
full
of
boys
who
were
carrying
Gilbert
Blythe
around
on
*NL*
their
shoulders
and
yelling
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
,
``
Hurrah
for
*NL*
Blythe
,
Medalist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Anne
felt
one
sickening
pang
of
defeat
and
disappointment
.
*NL*
So
she
had
failed
and
Gilbert
had
won
!
Well
,
Matthew
would
be
sorry
--
he
*NL*
had
been
so
sure
she
would
win
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
!
*NL*
*NL*
Somebody
called
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
cheers
for
Miss
Shirley
,
winner
of
the
Avery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
''
gasped
Jane
,
as
they
fled
to
the
girls
'
dressing
room
amid
*NL*
hearty
cheers
.
``
Oh
,
Anne
I
'm
so
proud
!
Is
n't
it
splendid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
girls
were
around
them
and
Anne
was
the
center
of
a
*NL*
laughing
,
congratulating
group
.
Her
shoulders
were
thumped
and
her
hands
*NL*
shaken
vigorously
.
She
was
pushed
and
pulled
and
hugged
and
among
it
all
*NL*
she
managed
to
whisper
to
Jane
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
wo
n't
Matthew
and
Marilla
be
pleased
!
I
must
write
the
news
home
*NL*
right
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Commencement
was
the
next
important
happening
.
The
exercises
were
held
*NL*
in
the
big
assembly
hall
of
the
Academy
.
Addresses
were
given
,
essays
*NL*
read
,
songs
sung
,
the
public
award
of
diplomas
,
prizes
and
medals
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
and
Marilla
were
there
,
with
eyes
and
ears
for
only
one
student
*NL*
on
the
platform
--
a
tall
girl
in
pale
green
,
with
faintly
flushed
*NL*
cheeks
and
starry
eyes
,
who
read
the
best
essay
and
was
pointed
out
and
*NL*
whispered
about
as
the
Avery
winner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reckon
you
're
glad
we
kept
her
,
Marilla
?
''
whispered
Matthew
,
speaking
*NL*
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
the
hall
,
when
Anne
had
finished
*NL*
her
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
first
time
I
've
been
glad
,
''
retorted
Marilla
.
``
You
do
like
*NL*
to
rub
things
in
,
Matthew
Cuthbert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Barry
,
who
was
sitting
behind
them
,
leaned
forward
and
poked
*NL*
Marilla
in
the
back
with
her
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
proud
of
that
Anne-girl
?
I
am
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
went
home
to
Avonlea
with
Matthew
and
Marilla
that
evening
.
She
had
*NL*
not
been
home
since
April
and
she
felt
that
she
could
not
wait
another
*NL*
day
.
The
apple
blossoms
were
out
and
the
world
was
fresh
and
young
.
*NL*
Diana
was
at
Green
Gables
to
meet
her
.
In
her
own
white
room
,
where
*NL*
Marilla
had
set
a
flowering
house
rose
on
the
window
sill
,
Anne
looked
*NL*
about
her
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Diana
,
it
's
so
good
to
be
back
again
.
It
's
so
good
to
see
those
*NL*
pointed
firs
coming
out
against
the
pink
sky
--
and
that
white
orchard
and
*NL*
the
old
Snow
Queen
.
Is
n't
the
breath
of
the
mint
delicious
?
And
that
tea
*NL*
rose
--
why
,
it
's
a
song
and
a
hope
and
a
prayer
all
in
one
.
And
it
's
GOOD
*NL*
to
see
you
again
,
Diana
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
liked
that
Stella
Maynard
better
than
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Diana
reproachfully
.
``
Josie
Pye
told
me
you
did
.
Josie
said
you
were
*NL*
INFATUATED
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
laughed
and
pelted
Diana
with
the
faded
``
June
lilies
''
of
her
*NL*
bouquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stella
Maynard
is
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
except
one
and
you
are
*NL*
that
one
,
Diana
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
love
you
more
than
ever
--
and
I
've
so
many
*NL*
things
to
tell
you
.
But
just
now
I
feel
as
if
it
were
joy
enough
to
sit
*NL*
here
and
look
at
you
.
I
'm
tired
,
I
think
--
tired
of
being
studious
and
*NL*
ambitious
.
I
mean
to
spend
at
least
two
hours
tomorrow
lying
out
in
the
*NL*
orchard
grass
,
thinking
of
absolutely
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
done
splendidly

Anne

I
suppose
you

n't
be
teaching

you
've
won
the
Avery
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
'm
going
to
Redmond
in
September

Does
n't
it
seem
wonderful
?
I
'll
*NL*
have
a
brand
new
stock
of
ambition
laid
in
by
that
time
after
three
*NL*
glorious
,
golden
months
of
vacation

Jane
and
Ruby
are
going
to
teach

*NL*
Is
n't
it
splendid
to

we
all
got
through
even
to
Moody
Spurgeon

*NL*
Josie
Pye
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Newbridge
trustees
have
offered

their

already

said
*NL*
Diana

earn
his

through

he
'll
get

leave

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
felt
a
queer
little
sensation
of
dismayed
surprise
.
She
had
not
*NL*
known
this
;
she
had
expected
that
Gilbert
would
be
going
to
Redmond
*NL*
also
.
What
would
she
do
without
their
inspiring
rivalry
?
Would
not
*NL*
work
,
even
at
a
coeducational
college
with
a
real
degree
in
prospect
,
be
*NL*
rather
flat
without
her
friend
the
enemy
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
it
suddenly
struck
Anne
that
Matthew
was
*NL*
not
looking
well
.
Surely
he
was
much
grayer
than
he
had
been
a
year
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
,
''
she
said
hesitatingly
when
he
had
gone
out
,
``
is
Matthew
quite
*NL*
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
n't
,
''
said
Marilla
in
a
troubled
tone
.
``
He
's
had
some
real
*NL*
bad
spells
with
his
heart
this
spring
and
he
wo
n't
spare
himself
a
mite
.
*NL*
I
've
been
real
worried
about
him
,
but
he
's
some
better
this
while
back
*NL*
and
we
've
got
a
good
hired
man
,
so
I
'm
hoping
he
'll
kind
of
rest
and
*NL*
pick
up
.
Maybe
he
will
now
you
're
home
.
You
always
cheer
him
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
leaned
across
the
table
and
took
Marilla
's
face
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
looking
as
well
yourself
as
I
'd
like
to
see
you

Marilla

*NL*
You
look
tired
.
I
'm
afraid
you
've
been
working
too
hard

You
must
take
*NL*
a
rest
,
now
that
I
'm
home

I
'm
just
going
to
take
this
one
day
off
to
*NL*
visit
all
the
dear
old
spots
and
hunt
up
my
old
dreams
,
and
then
it
will
*NL*
be
your
turn
to
be
lazy
while
I
do
the
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
smiled
affectionately
at
her
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
work
--
it
's
my
head

I
've
got
a
pain
so
often
now

behind
*NL*
my
eyes
.
Doctor
Spencer
's
been
fussing
with
glasses
,
but
they
do
n't
do
*NL*
me
any
good
.
There
is
a
distinguished
oculist
coming
to
the
Island
the
*NL*
last
of
June
and
the
doctor
says
I
must
see
him
.
I
guess
I
'll
have
to
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
read
or
sew
with
any
comfort
now

Well
,
Anne
,
you
've
done
real
*NL*
well
at
Queen
's
I
must
say
.
To
take
First
Class
License
in
one
year
and
*NL*
win
the
Avery
scholarship
--
well
,
well
,
Mrs.
Lynde
says
pride
goes
before
*NL*
a
fall
and
she
does
n't
believe
in
the
higher
education
of
women
at
all
;
*NL*
she
says
it
unfits
them
for
woman
's
true
sphere
.
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
*NL*
of
it
.
Speaking
of
Rachel
reminds
me
--
did
you
hear
anything
about
the
*NL*
Abbey
Bank
lately
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
it
was
shaky
,
''
answered
Anne
.
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
Rachel
said
.
She
was
up
here
one
day
last
week
and
said
*NL*
there
was
some
talk
about
it
.
Matthew
felt
real
worried
.
All
we
have
*NL*
saved
is
in
that
bank
--
every
penny
.
I
wanted
Matthew
to
put
it
in
the
*NL*
Savings
Bank
in
the
first
place
,
but
old
Mr.
Abbey
was
a
great
friend
of
*NL*
father
's
and
he
'd
always
banked
with
him
.
Matthew
said
any
bank
with
him
*NL*
at
the
head
of
it
was
good
enough
for
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
has
only
been
its
nominal
head
for
many
years
,
''
said
*NL*
Anne
.
``
He
is
a
very
old
man
;
his

really
at
the
head

the
*NL*
institution

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
Rachel
told
us
that
,
I
wanted
Matthew
to
draw
our
money
*NL*
right
out
and
he
said
he
'd
think
of
it
.
But
Mr.
Russell
told
him
*NL*
yesterday
that
the
bank
was
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
had
her
good
day
in
the
companionship
of
the
outdoor
world
.
She
*NL*
never
forgot
that
day
;
it
was
so
bright
and
golden
and
fair
,
so
free
*NL*
from
shadow
and
so
lavish
of
blossom
.
Anne
spent
some
of
its
rich
hours
*NL*
in
the
orchard
;
she
went
to
the
Dryad
's
Bubble
and
Willowmere
and
Violet
*NL*
Vale
;
she
called
at
the
manse
and
had
a
satisfying
talk
with
Mrs.
Allan
;
*NL*
and
finally
in
the
evening
she
went
with
Matthew
for
the
cows
,
through
*NL*
Lovers
'
Lane
to
the
back
pasture
.
The
woods
were
all
gloried
through
*NL*
with
sunset
and
the
warm
splendor
of
it
streamed
down
through
the
hill
*NL*
gaps
in
the
west
.
Matthew
walked
slowly
with
bent
head
;
Anne
,
tall
and
*NL*
erect
,
suited
her
springing
step
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
working
too
hard
today
,
Matthew
,
''
she
said
reproachfully
.
*NL*
``
Why
wo
n't
you
take
things
easier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
ca
n't
seem
to
,
''
said
Matthew
,
as
he
opened
the
yard
gate
*NL*
to
let
the
cows
through
.
``
It
's
only
that
I
'm
getting
old
,
Anne
,
and
keep
*NL*
forgetting
it
.
Well
,
well
,
I
've
always
worked
pretty
hard
and
I
'd
rather
*NL*
drop
in
harness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
been
the
boy
you
sent
for
,

said
Anne
wistfully
,
``
I
'd
be
able
*NL*
to
help
you
so
much
now
and
spare
you
in
a
hundred
ways

I
could
find
it
*NL*
in
my
heart
to
wish
I
had
been
,
just
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
'd
rather
have
you
than
a
dozen
boys

Anne

said
Matthew
*NL*
patting
her
hand
.
``
Just
mind
you
that
--
rather
than
a
dozen
boys

Well
*NL*
now
,
I
guess
it
was
n't
a
boy
that
took
the
Avery
scholarship
,
was
it
?
It
*NL*
was
a
girl
--
my
girl
--
my
girl
that
I
'm
proud
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
his
shy
smile
at
her
as
he
went
into
the
yard
.
Anne
took
the
*NL*
memory
of
it
with
her
when
she
went
to
her
room
that
night
and
sat
for
a
*NL*
long
while
at
her
open
window
,
thinking
of
the
past
and
dreaming
of
the
*NL*
future
.
Outside
the
Snow
Queen
was
mistily
white
in
the
moonshine
;
*NL*
the
frogs
were
singing
in
the
marsh
beyond
Orchard
Slope
.
Anne
always
*NL*
remembered
the
silvery
,
peaceful
beauty
and
fragrant
calm
of
that
night
.
*NL*
It
was
the
last
night
before
sorrow
touched
her
life
;
and
no
life
is
*NL*
ever
quite
the
same
again
when
once
that
cold
,
sanctifying
touch
has
*NL*
been
laid
upon
it
.

The

Death

*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
--
Matthew
--
what
is
the
matter
?
Matthew
,
are
you
sick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Marilla
who
spoke
,
alarm
in
every
jerky
word
.
Anne
came
through
*NL*
the
hall
,
her
hands
full
of
white
narcissus
,
--
it
was
long
before
Anne
*NL*
could
love
the
sight
or
odor
of
white
narcissus
again
,
--
in
time
to
hear
*NL*
her
and
to
see
Matthew
standing
in
the
porch
doorway
,
a
folded
paper
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
and
his
face
strangely
drawn
and
gray
.
Anne
dropped
her
*NL*
flowers
and
sprang
across
the
kitchen
to
him
at
the
same
moment
as
*NL*
Marilla
.
They
were
both
too
late
;
before
they
could
reach
him
Matthew
*NL*
had
fallen
across
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
fainted
,
''
gasped
Marilla
.
``
Anne
,
run
for
Martin
--
quick
,
quick
!
*NL*
He
's
at
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Martin
,
the
hired
man
,
who
had
just
driven
home
from
the
post
office
,
*NL*
started
at
once
for
the
doctor
,
calling
at
Orchard
Slope
on
his
way
to
*NL*
send
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Barry
over
.
Mrs.
Lynde
,
who
was
there
on
an
errand
,
*NL*
came
too
.
They
found
Anne
and
Marilla
distractedly
trying
to
restore
*NL*
Matthew
to
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Lynde
pushed
them
gently
aside
,
tried
his
pulse
,
and
then
laid
her
*NL*
ear
over
his
heart
.
She
looked
at
their
anxious
faces
sorrowfully
and
*NL*
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Marilla
,
''
she
said
gravely
.
``
I
do
n't
think
--
we
can
do
anything
for
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Lynde
,
you
do
n't
think
--
you
ca
n't
think
Matthew
is
--
is
--
''
Anne
*NL*
could
not
say
the
dreadful
word
;
she
turned
sick
and
pallid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
yes
,
I
'm
afraid
of
it
.
Look
at
his
face
.
When
you
've
seen
that
*NL*
look
as
often
as
I
have
you
'll
know
what
it
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
looked
at
the
still
face
and
there
beheld
the
seal
of
the
Great
*NL*
Presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
doctor
came
he
said
that
death
had
been
instantaneous
and
*NL*
probably
painless
,
caused
in
all
likelihood
by
some
sudden
shock
.
The
*NL*
secret
of
the
shock
was
discovered
to
be
in
the
paper
Matthew
had
held
*NL*
and
which
Martin
had
brought
from
the
office
that
morning
.
It
contained
*NL*
an
account
of
the
failure
of
the
Abbey
Bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
spread
quickly
through
Avonlea
,
and
all
day
friends
and
*NL*
neighbors
thronged
Green
Gables
and
came
and
went
on
errands
of
kindness
*NL*
for
the
dead
and
living
.
For
the
first
time
shy
,
quiet
Matthew
Cuthbert
*NL*
was
a
person
of
central
importance
;
the
white
majesty
of
death
had
*NL*
fallen
on
him
and
set
him
apart
as
one
crowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
calm
night
came
softly
down
over
Green
Gables
the
old
house
was
*NL*
hushed
and
tranquil
.
In
the
parlor
lay
Matthew
Cuthbert
in
his
coffin
,
*NL*
his
long
gray
hair
framing
his
placid
face
on
which
there
was
a
little
*NL*
kindly
smile
as
if
he
but
slept
,
dreaming
pleasant
dreams
.
There
were
*NL*
flowers
about
him
--
sweet
old-fashioned
flowers
which
his
mother
had
*NL*
planted
in
the
homestead
garden
in
her
bridal
days
and
for
which
Matthew
*NL*
had
always
had
a
secret
,
wordless
love
.
Anne
had
gathered
them
and
*NL*
brought
them
to
him
,
her
anguished
,
tearless
eyes
burning
in
her
white
*NL*
face
.
It
was
the
last
thing
she
could
do
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Barrys
and
Mrs.
Lynde
stayed
with
them
that
night
.
Diana
,
going
to
*NL*
the
east
gable
,
where
Anne
was
standing
at
her
window
,
said
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
dear
,
would
you
like
to
have
me
sleep
with
you
tonight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Diana
.
''
Anne
looked
earnestly
into
her
friend
's
face
.
``
I
*NL*
think
you
wo
n't
misunderstand
me
when
I
say
I
want
to
be
alone
.
I
'm
not
*NL*
afraid
.
I
have
n't
been
alone
one
minute
since
it
happened
--
and
I
want
to
*NL*
be
.
I
want
to
be
quite
silent
and
quiet
and
try
to
realize
it
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
realize
it
.
Half
the
time
it
seems
to
me
that
Matthew
ca
n't
be
dead
;
and
*NL*
the
other
half
it
seems
as
if
he
must
have
been
dead
for
a
long
time
and
*NL*
I
've
had
this
horrible
dull
ache
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Diana
did
not
quite
understand
.
Marilla
's
impassioned
grief
,
breaking
*NL*
all
the
bounds
of
natural
reserve
and
lifelong
habit
in
its
stormy
rush
,
*NL*
she
could
comprehend
better
than
Anne
's
tearless
agony
.
But
she
went
*NL*
away
kindly
,
leaving
Anne
alone
to
keep
her
first
vigil
with
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
hoped
that
the
tears
would
come
in
solitude
.
It
seemed
to
her
a
*NL*
terrible
thing
that
she
could
not
shed
a
tear
for
Matthew
,
whom
she
had
*NL*
loved
so
much
and
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
,
Matthew
who
had
walked
*NL*
with
her
last
evening
at
sunset
and
was
now
lying
in
the
dim
room
below
*NL*
with
that
awful
peace
on
his
brow
.
But
no
tears
came
at
first
,
even
when
*NL*
she
knelt
by
her
window
in
the
darkness
and
prayed
,
looking
up
to
the
*NL*
stars
beyond
the
hills
--
no
tears
,
only
the
same
horrible
dull
ache
of
*NL*
misery
that
kept
on
aching
until
she
fell
asleep
,
worn
out
with
the
*NL*
day
's
pain
and
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
night
she
awakened
,
with
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
about
*NL*
her
,
and
the
recollection
of
the
day
came
over
her
like
a
wave
of
*NL*
sorrow
.
She
could
see
Matthew
's
face
smiling
at
her
as
he
had
smiled
*NL*
when
they
parted
at
the
gate
that
last
evening
--
she
could
hear
his
voice
*NL*
saying
,
``
My
girl
--
my
girl
that
I
'm
proud
of
.
''
Then
the
tears
came
and
*NL*
Anne
wept
her
heart
out
.
Marilla
heard
her
and
crept
in
to
comfort
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
there
--
do
n't
cry
so
,
dearie
.
It
ca
n't
bring
him
back
.
*NL*
It
--
it
--
is
n't
right
to
cry
so
.
I
knew
that
today
,
but
I
could
n't
help
*NL*
it
then
.
He
'd
always
been
such
a
good
,
kind
brother
to
me
--
but
God
knows
*NL*
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
just
let
me
cry
,
Marilla
,
''
sobbed
Anne
.
``
The
tears
do
n't
hurt
me
*NL*
like
that
ache
did
.
Stay
here
for
a
little
while
with
me
and
keep
your
*NL*
arm
round
me
--
so
.
I
could
n't
have
Diana
stay
,
she
's
good
and
kind
and
*NL*
sweet
--
but
it
's
not
her
sorrow
--
she
's
outside
of
it
and
she
could
n't
*NL*
come
close
enough
to
my
heart
to
help
me
.
It
's
our
sorrow
--
yours
and
*NL*
mine
.
Oh
,
Marilla
,
what
will
we
do
without
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
got
each
other
,
Anne
.
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'd
do
if
you
were
n't
*NL*
here
--
if
you
'd
never
come
.
Oh
,
Anne
,
I
know
I
've
been
kind
of
strict
and
*NL*
harsh
with
you
maybe
--
but
you
must
n't
think
I
did
n't
love
you
as
well
as
*NL*
Matthew
did
,
for
all
that
.
I
want
to
tell
you
now
when
I
can
.
It
's
never
*NL*
been
easy
for
me
to
say
things
out
of
my
heart
,
but
at
times
like
this
*NL*
it
's
easier
.
I
love
you
as
dear
as
if
you
were
my
own
flesh
and
blood
*NL*
and
you
've
been
my
joy
and
comfort
ever
since
you
came
to
Green
Gables

*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
afterwards
they
carried
Matthew
Cuthbert
over
his
homestead
*NL*
threshold
and
away
from
the
fields
he
had
tilled
and
the
orchards
he
had
*NL*
loved
and
the
trees
he
had
planted
;
and
then
Avonlea
settled
back
to
its
*NL*
usual
placidity
and
even
at
Green
Gables
affairs
slipped
into
their
old
*NL*
groove
and
work
was
done
and
duties
fulfilled
with
regularity
as
before
,
*NL*
although
always
with
the
aching
sense
of
``
loss
in
all
familiar
things
.
''
*NL*
Anne
,
new
to
grief
,
thought
it
almost
sad
that
it
could
be
so
--
that
*NL*
they
COULD
go
on
in
the
old
way
without
Matthew
.
She
felt
something
like
*NL*
shame
and
remorse
when
she
discovered
that
the
sunrises
behind
the
firs
*NL*
and
the
pale
pink
buds
opening
in
the
garden
gave
her
the
old
inrush
of
*NL*
gladness
when
she
saw
them
--
that
Diana
's
visits
were
pleasant
to
her
*NL*
and
that
Diana
's
merry
words
and
ways
moved
her
to
laughter
and
*NL*
smiles
--
that
,
in
brief
,
the
beautiful
world
of
blossom
and
love
and
*NL*
friendship
had
lost
none
of
its
power
to
please
her
fancy
and
thrill
her
*NL*
heart
,
that
life
still
called
to
her
with
many
insistent
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
like
disloyalty
to
Matthew
,
somehow
,
to
find
pleasure
in
*NL*
these
things
now
that
he
has
gone
,
''
she
said
wistfully
to
Mrs.
Allan
*NL*
one
evening
when
they
were
together
in
the
manse
garden
.
``
I
miss
him
so
*NL*
much
--
all
the
time
--
and
yet
,
Mrs.
Allan
,
the
world
and
life
seem
very
*NL*
beautiful
and
interesting
to
me
for
all
.
Today
Diana
said
something
*NL*
funny
and
I
found
myself
laughing
.
I
thought
when
it
happened
I
could
*NL*
never
laugh
again
.
And
it
somehow
seems
as
if
I
ought
n't
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Matthew
was
here
he
liked
to
hear
you
laugh
and
he
liked
to
know
*NL*
that
you
found
pleasure
in
the
pleasant
things
around
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Allan
gently
.
``
He
is
just
away
now
;
and
he
likes
to
know
it
just
the
*NL*
same
.
I
am
sure
we
should
not
shut
our
hearts
against
the
healing
*NL*
influences
that
nature
offers
us
.
But
I
can
understand
your
feeling
.
*NL*
I
think
we
all
experience
the
same
thing
.
We
resent
the
thought
that
*NL*
anything
can
please
us
when
someone
we
love
is
no
longer
here
to
share
*NL*
the
pleasure
with
us
,
and
we
almost
feel
as
if
we
were
unfaithful
to
our
*NL*
sorrow
when
we
find
our
interest
in
life
returning
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
down
to
the
graveyard
to
plant
a
rosebush
on
Matthew
's
grave
*NL*
this
afternoon
,
''
said
Anne
dreamily
.
``
I
took
a
slip
of
the
little
white
*NL*
Scotch
rosebush
his
mother
brought
out
from
Scotland
long
ago
;
Matthew
*NL*
always
liked
those
roses
the
best
--
they
were
so
small
and
sweet
on
*NL*
their
thorny
stems
.
It
made
me
feel
glad
that
I
could
plant
it
by
his
*NL*
grave
--
as
if
I
were
doing
something
that
must
please
him
in
taking
it
*NL*
there
to
be
near
him
.
I
hope
he
has
roses
like
them
in
heaven
.
Perhaps
*NL*
the
souls
of
all
those
little
white
roses
that
he
has
loved
so
many
*NL*
summers
were
all
there
to
meet
him
.
I
must
go
home
now
.
Marilla
is
all
*NL*
alone
and
she
gets
lonely
at
twilight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
lonelier
still
,
I
fear
,
when
you
go
away
again
to
college

*NL*
said
Mrs.
Allan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
did
not
reply
;
she
said
good
night
and
went
slowly
back
to
green
*NL*
Gables
.
Marilla
was
sitting
on
the
front
door-steps
and
Anne
sat
down
*NL*
beside
her
.
The
door
was
open
behind
them
,
held
back
by
a
big
pink
conch
*NL*
shell
with
hints
of
sea
sunsets
in
its
smooth
inner
convolutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
gathered
some
sprays
of
pale-yellow
honeysuckle
and
put
them
in
*NL*
her
hair
.
She
liked
the
delicious
hint
of
fragrance
,
as
some
aerial
*NL*
benediction
,
above
her
every
time
she
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
Spencer
was
here
while
you
were
away
,
''
Marilla
said
.
``
He
says
*NL*
that
the
specialist
will
be
in
town
tomorrow
and
he
insists
that
I
must
*NL*
go
in
and
have
my
eyes
examined
.
I
suppose
I
'd
better
go
and
have
it
*NL*
over
.
I
'll
be
more
than
thankful
if
the
man
can
give
me
the
right
kind
*NL*
of
glasses
to
suit
my
eyes
.
You
wo

staying
here
alone
while
I
'm
*NL*
away
,
will
you

Martin
will
have
to

in

baking

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

will
come
over
for
company
for

attend

ironing

baking
beautifully

starch
the
handkerchiefs

*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
girl
you
were
for
making
mistakes
in
them
days

Anne
.
You
were
*NL*
always
getting
into
scrapes

I
did
use
to

you
were
possessed

Do
*NL*
you
mind
the

you
dyed
your
hair
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed

I
shall
never
forget
it

smiled
Anne
,
touching
the
heavy
*NL*
braid
of
hair
that
was
wound
about
her
shapely
head
.
``
I
laugh
a
little
*NL*
now
sometimes
when
I
think
what
a
worry
my
hair
used
to
be
to
me

but
I
*NL*
do
n't
laugh
MUCH
,
because
it
was
a
very
real
trouble
then
.
I
did
suffer
*NL*
terribly
over
my
hair
and
my
freckles
.
My
freckles
are
really
gone
;
and
*NL*
people
are
nice
enough
to
tell
me
my
hair
is
auburn
now

all
but
Josie
*NL*
Pye

She
informed
me
yesterday
that
she
really
thought
it
was
redder
*NL*
than
ever
,
or
at
least
my
black
dress
made
it
look
redder
,
and
she
asked
*NL*
me
if
people
who
had
red
hair
ever
got
used
to
having
it

Marilla
,
I
've
*NL*
almost
decided
to
give
up
trying
to
like
Josie
Pye

I
've
made
what
I
*NL*
would
once
have
called
a
heroic
effort
to
like
her
,
but
Josie
Pye
wo
n't
*NL*
BE
liked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Josie
is
a
Pye

said
Marilla
sharply
,
``
so
she
ca
n't
help
being
*NL*
disagreeable

I
suppose
people
of
that
kind
serve
some
useful
purpose
in
*NL*
society

I
must
say
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
any
more

No

Marilla
absently

``
I
saw
him
in

church
last
Sunday

seemed

tall

manly

looks

did
at

age

you

to

after
awhile

I
was
sulky

angry

I
wanted
to
punish

first

He
never
came
back

the
Blythes

all
mighty

always

rather
sorry

``
So

softly

*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XXXVIII

The
Bend
in
the
road
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
went
to
town
the
next
day
and
returned
in
the
evening
.
Anne
had
*NL*
gone
over
to
Orchard
Slope
with
Diana
and
came
back
to
find
Marilla
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
,
sitting
by
the
table
with
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
.
*NL*
Something
in
her
dejected
attitude
struck
a
chill
to
Anne
's
heart
.
She
*NL*
had
never
seen
Marilla
sit
limply
inert
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
very
tired
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
no
--
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Marilla
wearily
,
looking
up
.
``
I
suppose
I
*NL*
am
tired
but
I
have
n't
thought
about
it
.
It
's
not
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
the
oculist
?
What
did
he
say
?
''
asked
Anne
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
.
He
examined
my
eyes
.
He
says
that
if
I
give
up
all
*NL*
reading
and
sewing
entirely
and
any
kind
of
work
that
strains
the
eyes
,
*NL*
and
if
I
'm
careful
not
to
cry
,
and
if
I
wear
the
glasses
he
's
given
me
*NL*
he
thinks
my
eyes
may
not
get
any
worse
and
my
headaches
will
be
cured
.
*NL*
But
if
I
do
n't
he
says
I
'll
certainly
be
stone-blind
in
six
months
.
*NL*
Blind
!
Anne
,
just
think
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
Anne
,
after
her
first
quick
exclamation
of
dismay
,
was
*NL*
silent
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
NOT
speak
.
Then
she
said
*NL*
bravely
,
but
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marilla
,
DO
N'T
think
of
it
.
You
know
he
has
given
you
hope
.
If
you
are
*NL*
careful
you
wo
n't
lose
your
sight
altogether
;
and
if
his
glasses
cure
*NL*
your
headaches
it
will
be
a
great
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
it
much
hope

said
Marilla
bitterly
.
``
What
am
I
to
live
*NL*
for
if
I
ca
n't
read
or
sew
or
do
anything
like
that

I
might
as
well
*NL*
be
blind
--
or
dead
.
And
as
for
crying
,
I
ca
n't
help
that
when
I
get
*NL*
lonesome
.
But
there
,
it
's
no
good
talking
about
it
.
If
you
'll
get
me
*NL*
a
cup
of
tea
I
'll
be
thankful
.
I
'm
about
done
out
.
Do
n't
say
anything
*NL*
about
this
to
any
one
for
a
spell
yet
,
anyway
.
I
ca
n't
bear
that
folks
*NL*
should
come
here
to
question
and
sympathize
and
talk
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marilla
had
eaten
her
lunch
Anne
persuaded
her
to
go
to
bed
.
Then
*NL*
Anne
went
herself
to
the
east
gable
and
sat
down
by
her
window
in
the
*NL*
darkness
alone
with
her
tears
and
her
heaviness
of
heart
.
How
sadly
*NL*
things
had
changed
since
she
had
sat
there
the
night
after
coming
home
!
*NL*
Then
she
had
been
full
of
hope
and
joy
and
the
future
had
looked
rosy
*NL*
with
promise
.
Anne
felt
as
if
she
had
lived
years
since
then
,
but
before
*NL*
she
went
to
bed
there
was
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
peace
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
She
had
looked
her
duty
courageously
in
the
face
and
found
it
a
*NL*
friend
--
as
duty
ever
is
when
we
meet
it
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
a
few
days
later
Marilla
came
slowly
in
from
the
front
*NL*
yard
where
she
had
been
talking
to
a
caller
--
a
man
whom
Anne
knew
by
*NL*
sight
as
Sadler
from
Carmody
.
Anne
wondered
what
he
could
have
been
*NL*
saying
to
bring
that
look
to
Marilla
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
Mr.
Sadler
want
,
Marilla
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
sat
down
by
the
window
and
looked
at
Anne
.
There
were
tears
in
*NL*
her
eyes
in
defiance
of
the
oculist
's
prohibition
and
her
voice
broke
as
*NL*
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
heard
that
I
was
going
to
sell
Green
Gables
and
he
wants
to
buy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buy
it
!
Buy
Green
Gables
?
''
Anne
wondered
if
she
had
heard
aright
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Marilla
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
sell
Green
Gables
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anne
,
I
do
n't
know
what
else
is
to
be
done
.
I
've
thought
it
all
over
.
*NL*
If
my
eyes
were
strong
I
could
stay
here
and
make
out
to
look
after
*NL*
things
and
manage
,
with
a
good
hired
man
.
But
as
it
is
I
ca
n't
.
I
may
*NL*
lose
my
sight
altogether
;
and
anyway
I
'll
not
be
fit
to
run
things
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
never
thought
I
'd
live
to
see
the
day
when
I
'd
have
to
sell
my
home
.
*NL*
But
things
would
only
go
behind
worse
and
worse
all
the
time
,
till
*NL*
nobody
would
want
to
buy
it
.
Every
cent
of
our
money
went
in
that
bank
;
*NL*
and
there
's
some
notes
Matthew
gave
last
fall
to
pay
.
Mrs.
Lynde
advises
*NL*
me
to
sell
the
farm
and
board
somewhere
--
with
her
I
suppose
.
It
wo
n't
*NL*
bring
much
--
it
's
small
and
the
buildings
are
old
.
But
it
'll
be
enough
*NL*
for
me
to
live
on
I
reckon
.
I
'm
thankful
you
're
provided
for
with
that
*NL*
scholarship
,
Anne
.
I
'm
sorry
you
wo
n't
have
a
home
to
come
to
in
your
*NL*
vacations
,
that
's
all
,
but
I
suppose
you
'll
manage
somehow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
broke
down
and
wept
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
sell
Green
Gables
,
''
said
Anne
resolutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
I
wish
I
did
n't
have
to
.
But
you
can
see
for
yourself
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
stay
here
alone
.
I
'd
go
crazy
with
trouble
and
loneliness
.
And
my
*NL*
sight
would
go
--
I
know
it
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
have
to
stay
here
alone

Marilla

I
'll
be
with
you

I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
Redmond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
going
to
Redmond
!
''
Marilla
lifted
her
worn
face
from
her
hands
and
*NL*
looked
at
Anne
.
``
Why
,
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
what
I
say
.
I
'm
not
going
to
take
the
scholarship
.
I
decided
so
*NL*
the
night
after
you
came
home
from
town
.
You
surely
do
n't
think
I
could
*NL*
leave
you
alone
in
your
trouble
,
Marilla
,
after
all
you
've
done
for
me
.
*NL*
I
've
been
thinking
and
planning
.
Let
me
tell
you
my
plans
.
Mr.
Barry
*NL*
wants
to
rent
the
farm
for
next
year
.
So
you
wo
n't
have
any
bother
over
*NL*
that
.
And
I
'm
going
to
teach
.
I
've
applied
for
the
school
here
--
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
expect
to
get
it
for
I
understand
the
trustees
have
promised
it
to
*NL*
Gilbert
Blythe
.
But
I
can
have
the
Carmody
school
--
Mr.
Blair
told
me
*NL*
so
last
night
at
the
store
.
Of
course
that
wo
n't
be
quite
as
nice
or
*NL*
convenient
as
if
I
had
the
Avonlea
school
.
But
I
can
board
home
and
*NL*
drive
myself
over
to
Carmody
and
back
,
in
the
warm
weather
at
least
.
And
*NL*
even
in
winter
I
can
come
home
Fridays
.
We
'll
keep
a
horse
for
that
.
Oh
,
*NL*
I
have
it
all
planned
out
,
Marilla
.
And
I
'll
read
to
you
and
keep
you
*NL*
cheered
up
.
You
sha
'n'
t
be
dull
or
lonesome
.
And
we
'll
be
real
cozy
and
*NL*
happy
here
together
,
you
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
had
listened
like
a
woman
in
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Anne
,
I
could
get
on
real
well
if
you
were
here
,
I
know
.
But
I
*NL*
ca
n't
let
you
sacrifice
yourself
so
for
me

It
would
be
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
Anne
laughed
merrily
.
``
There
is
no
sacrifice
.
Nothing
could
*NL*
be
worse
than
giving
up
Green
Gables
--
nothing
could
hurt
me
more
.
We
*NL*
must
keep
the
dear
old
place
.
My
mind
is
quite
made
up
,
Marilla
.
I
'm
NOT
*NL*
going
to
Redmond
;
and
I
AM
going
to
stay
here
and
teach

Do
n't
you
worry
*NL*
about
me
a
bit

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
your
ambitions

--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
just
as
ambitious
as
ever

Only
,
I
've
changed
the
object
of
my
*NL*
ambitions

I
'm
going
to
be
a
good
teacher
--
and
I
'm
going
to
save
your
*NL*
eyesight
.
Besides
,
I
mean
to
study
at
home
here
and
take
a
little
*NL*
college
course
all
by
myself
.
Oh
,
I
've
dozens
of
plans

Marilla

I
've
*NL*
been
thinking
them
out
for
a
week

I
shall
give
life
here
my
best

and
*NL*
I
believe
it
will
give
its
best
to
me
in
return

When
I
left
Queen
's
my
*NL*
future
seemed
to
stretch
out
before
me
like
a
straight
road

I
thought
*NL*
I
could
see
along
it
for
many
a
milestone

Now
there
is
a
bend
in
it

I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
lies
around
the
bend
,
but
I
'm
going
to
believe
that
the
*NL*
best
does
.
It
has
a
fascination
of
its
own
,
that
bend
,
Marilla
.
I
wonder
*NL*
how
the
road
beyond
it
goes
--
what
there
is
of
green
glory
and
*NL*
soft
,
checkered
light
and
shadows
--
what
new
landscapes
--
what
new
*NL*
beauties
--
what
curves
and
hills
and
valleys
further
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
as
if
I
ought
to
let
you
give
it
up

said
Marilla
,
*NL*
referring
to
the
scholarship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
prevent
me

I

sixteen

a

obstinate

laughed
Anne
.
``
Oh

Marilla

I
do

like

there
is
no

for

I

heart
glad
over

very

*NL*
*NL*
When
it
became
noised
abroad
in
Avonlea
that
Anne
Shirley
had
given
up
*NL*
the
idea
of
going
to
college
and
intended
to
stay
home
and
teach
there
*NL*
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
over
it
.
Most
of
the
good
folks
,
not
*NL*
knowing
about
Marilla
's
eyes
,
thought
she
was
foolish
.
Mrs.
Allan
did
*NL*
not
.
She
told
Anne
so
in
approving
words
that
brought
tears
of
pleasure
*NL*
to
the
girl
's
eyes
.
Neither
did
good
Mrs.
Lynde
.
She
came
up
one
evening
*NL*
and
found
Anne
and
Marilla
sitting
at
the
front
door
in
the
warm
,
*NL*
scented
summer
dusk
.
They
liked
to
sit
there
when
the
twilight
came
down
*NL*
and
the
white
moths
flew
about
in
the
garden
and
the
odor
of
mint
filled
*NL*
the
dewy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rachel
deposited
her
substantial
person
upon
the
stone
bench
by
the
*NL*
door
,
behind
which
grew
a
row
of
tall
pink
and
yellow
hollyhocks
,
with
a
*NL*
long
breath
of
mingled
weariness
and
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
I
'm
getting
glad
to
sit
down

I
've
been
on
my
feet
all
day

*NL*
and
two
hundred
pounds
is
a
good
bit
for
two
feet
to
carry
round
.
It
's
*NL*
a
great
blessing
not
to
be
fat

Marilla

I
hope
you
appreciate
it

Well
,
*NL*
Anne

I
hear
you
've
given
up
your
notion

real
glad
to
hear
it

You

got
as
much
education
now
as
a

can
be
*NL*
comfortable
with

I
do
n't
believe
in

going
to
college
with
the
men
*NL*

cramming
their
heads
full
of
Latin

decided

give

*NL*
*NL*
``

Lynde

cried
Anne

springing
to
her
feet
in
her
surprise

``
Why

I
*NL*
thought
they
had
promised
it
to
Gilbert
Blythe

*NL*
``
So
they
did
.
But
as
soon
as
Gilbert
heard
that
you
had
applied
for
it
*NL*
he
went
to
them
--
they
had
a
business
meeting
at
the
school
last
night
,
*NL*
you
know
--
and
told
them
that
he
withdrew
his
application
,
and
suggested
*NL*
that
they
accept
yours
.
He
said
he
was
going
to
teach
at
White
Sands
.
Of
*NL*
course
he
knew
how
much
you
wanted
to
stay
with
Marilla
,
and
I
must
*NL*
say
I
think
it
was
real
kind
and
thoughtful
in
him
,
that
's
what

Real
*NL*
self-sacrificing
,
too
,
for
he
'll
have
his
board
to
pay
at
White
Sands
,
*NL*
and
everybody
knows
he
's
got
to
earn
his
own
way
through
college
.
So
the
*NL*
trustees
decided
to
take
you
.
I
was
tickled
to
death
when
Thomas
came
*NL*
home
and
told
me
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
that
I

murmured
Anne

``
I
mean

I
do
n't

think
I

a

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
ca

prevent
him
now

He
's
signed
papers
with

White

So
it
would
n't
do
him
any
good
now

Of

you
'll
take

Josie

There

been
some
Pye

other
going

Avonlea

I
guess
their
mission

was
to
keep

reminded

winking

at

Anne
ran
down
the
clover
slope
like
a
deer

disappeared
in
the
firry

shadows
of
the
Haunted
Wood

Mrs.

looked
after

indulgently

Marilla

with
a
momentary
return

her
old
crispness

But
crispness
was
no

Marilla

distinguishing
characteristic

told

that
night

``

Anne
went
to
the
little
Avonlea
graveyard
the
next
evening
to
put
fresh
*NL*
flowers
on
Matthew
's
grave
and
water
the
Scotch
rosebush
.
She
lingered
*NL*
there
until
dusk
,
liking
the
peace
and
calm
of
the
little
place
,
*NL*
with
its
poplars
whose
rustle
was
like
low
,
friendly
speech

and
its
*NL*
whispering
grasses
growing
at
will
among
the
graves

When
she
finally
*NL*
left
it
and
walked
down
the
long
hill
that
sloped
to
the
Lake
of
Shining
*NL*
Waters
it
was
past
sunset
and
all
Avonlea
lay
before
her
in
a
dreamlike
*NL*
afterlight
--
``
a
haunt
of
ancient
peace
.
''
There
was
a
freshness
in
the
*NL*
air
as
of
a
wind
that
had
blown
over
honey-sweet
fields
of
clover
.
Home
*NL*
lights
twinkled
out
here
and
there
among
the
homestead
trees
.
Beyond
lay
*NL*
the
sea
,
misty
and
purple
,
with
its
haunting
,
unceasing
murmur
.
The
west
*NL*
was
a
glory
of
soft
mingled
hues
,
and
the
pond
reflected
them
all
in
*NL*
still
softer
shadings
.
The
beauty
of
it
all
thrilled
Anne
's
heart
,
and
*NL*
she
gratefully
opened
the
gates
of
her
soul
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
world
,
''
she
murmured
,
``
you
are
very
lovely
,
and
I
am
glad
to
*NL*
be
alive
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Halfway
down
the
hill
a
tall
lad
came
whistling
out
of
a
gate
before
the
*NL*
Blythe
homestead
.
It
was
Gilbert
,
and
the
whistle
died
on
his
lips
as
he
*NL*
recognized
Anne
.
He
lifted
his
cap
courteously
,
but
he
would
have
passed
*NL*
on
in
silence
,
if
Anne
had
not
stopped
and
held
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilbert
,
''
she
said
,
with
scarlet
cheeks
,
``
I
want
to
thank
you
for
*NL*
giving
up
the
school
for
me
.
It
was
very
good
of
you
--
and
I
want
you
to
*NL*
know
that
I
appreciate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gilbert
took
the
offered
hand
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
particularly
good
of
me
at
all
,
Anne
.
I
was
pleased
to
be
*NL*
able
to
do
you
some
small
service
.
Are
we
going
to
be
friends
after
*NL*
this
?
Have
you
really
forgiven
me
my
old
fault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
laughed
and
tried
unsuccessfully
to
withdraw
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgave
you
that
day
by
the
pond
landing
,
although
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
it
.
What
a
stubborn
little
goose
I
was
.
I
've
been
--
I
may
as
well
make
a
*NL*
complete
confession
--
I
've
been
sorry
ever
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
be
the
best
of
friends
,
''
said
Gilbert
,
jubilantly
.
``
We
*NL*
were
born
to
be
good
friends
,
Anne
.
You
've
thwarted
destiny
enough
.
I
*NL*
know
we
can
help
each
other
in
many
ways
.
You
are
going
to
keep
up
your
*NL*
studies
,
are
n't
you
?
So
am
I.
Come
,
I
'm
going
to
walk
home
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marilla
looked
curiously
at
Anne
when
the
latter
entered
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
came
up
the
lane
with
you
,
Anne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilbert
Blythe
,
''
answered
Anne
,
vexed
to
find
herself
blushing
.
``
I
met
*NL*
him
on
Barry
's
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
you
and
Gilbert
Blythe
were
such
good
friends
that
you
'd
*NL*
stand
for
half
an
hour
at
the
gate
talking
to
him
,
''
said
Marilla
with
a
*NL*
dry
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
been
--
we
've
been
good
enemies
.
But
we
have
decided
that
it
*NL*
will
be
much
more
sensible
to
be
good
friends
in
the
future
.
Were
we
*NL*
really
there
half
an
hour
?
It
seemed
just
a
few
minutes
.
But
,
you
see
,
*NL*
we
have
five
years
'
lost
conversations
to
catch
up
with
,
Marilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
sat
long
at
her
window
that
night
companioned
by
a
glad
content
.
*NL*
The
wind
purred
softly
in
the
cherry
boughs
,
and
the
mint
breaths
came
*NL*
up
to
her
.
The
stars
twinkled
over
the
pointed
firs
in
the
hollow
and
*NL*
Diana
's
light
gleamed
through
the
old
gap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anne
's
horizons
had
closed
in
since
the
night
she
had
sat
there
after
*NL*
coming
home
from
Queen
's
;
but
if
the
path
set
before
her
feet
was
to
be
*NL*
narrow
she
knew
that
flowers
of
quiet
happiness
would
bloom
along
it
.
*NL*
The
joy
of
sincere
work
and
worthy
aspiration
and
congenial
friendship
*NL*
were
to
be
hers
;
nothing
could
rob
her
of
her
birthright
of
fancy
or
her
*NL*
ideal
world
of
dreams
.
And
there
was
always
the
bend
in
the
road
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
God
's
in
his
heaven
,
all
's
right
with
the
world
,
'
''
whispered
Anne
*NL*
softly
.
