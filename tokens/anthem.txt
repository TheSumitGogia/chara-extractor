Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
sin
to
write
this
.
It
is
a
sin
to
think
words
no
others
*NL*
think
and
to
put
them
down
upon
a
paper
no
others
are
to
see
.
It
*NL*
is
base
and
evil
.
It
is
as
if
we
were
speaking
alone
to
no
ears
*NL*
but
our
own
.
And
we
know
well
that
there
is
no
transgression
*NL*
blacker
than
to
do
or
think
alone
.
We
have
broken
the
laws
.
The
*NL*
laws
say
that
men
may
not
write
unless
the
Council
of
Vocations
*NL*
bid
them
so
.
May
we
be
forgiven
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
not
the
only
sin
upon
us
.
We
have
committed
a
greater
*NL*
crime
,
and
for
this
crime
there
is
no
name
.
What
punishment
*NL*
awaits
us
if
it
be
discovered
we
know
not
,
for
no
such
crime
has
*NL*
come
in
the
memory
of
men
and
there
are
no
laws
to
provide
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
dark
here
.
The
flame
of
the
candle
stands
still
in
the
air
.
*NL*
Nothing
moves
in
this
tunnel
save
our
-LSB-
-
hand
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
hands
+
-RCB-
on
the
paper
.
We
are
*NL*
alone
here
under
the
earth
.
It
is
a
fearful
word
,
alone
.
The
laws
*NL*
say
that
none
among
men
may
be
alone
,
ever
and
at
any
time
,
for
*NL*
this
is
the
great
transgression
and
the
root
of
all
evil
.
But
we
*NL*
have
broken
many
laws
.
And
now
there
is
nothing
here
save
our
one
*NL*
body
,
and
it
is
strange
to
see
only
two
legs
stretched
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
on
the
wall
before
us
the
shadow
of
our
one
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
are
cracked
and
water
runs
upon
them
in
thin
threads
*NL*
without
sound
,
black
and
glistening
as
blood
.
We
stole
the
candle
*NL*
from
the
larder
of
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
.
We
shall
be
*NL*
sentenced
to
ten
years
in
the
Palace
of
Corrective
Detention
if
*NL*
it
be
discovered
.
But
this
matters
not
.
It
matters
only
that
the
*NL*
light
is
precious
and
we
should
not
waste
it
to
write
when
we
*NL*
need
it
for
that
work
which
is
our
crime
.
Nothing
matters
save
*NL*
the
work
,
our
secret
,
our
evil
,
our
precious
work
.
Still
,
we
must
*NL*
also
write
,
for
--
may
the
-LSB-
-
council
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Council
+
-RCB-
have
mercy
upon
us
!
--
we
wish
to
*NL*
speak
for
once
to
no
ears
but
our
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
name
is
Equality
7-2521
,
as
it
is
written
on
the
iron
*NL*
bracelet
which
all
men
wear
on
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
their
+
-RCB-
left
wrists
with
their
names
*NL*
upon
it
.
We
are
twenty-one
years
old
.
We
are
six
feet
tall
,
and
*NL*
this
is
a
burden
,
for
there
are
not
many
men
who
are
six
feet
*NL*
tall
.
Ever
have
the
Teachers
and
the
Leaders
pointed
to
us
and
*NL*
frowned
and
said
:
``
There
is
evil
in
your
bones
,
Equality
7-2521
,
*NL*
for
your
body
has
grown
beyond
the
bodies
of
your
brothers
.
''
But
*NL*
we
can
not
change
our
bones
nor
our
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
born
with
a
curse
.
It
has
always
driven
us
to
thoughts
*NL*
which
are
forbidden
.
It
has
always
given
us
wishes
which
men
may
*NL*
not
wish
.
We
know
that
we
are
evil
,
but
there
is
no
will
in
us
*NL*
and
no
power
to
resist
it
.
This
is
our
wonder
and
our
secret
*NL*
fear
,
that
we
know
and
do
not
resist
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
strive
to
be
like
all
our
brother
men
,
for
all
men
must
be
*NL*
alike
.
Over
the
portals
of
the
Palace
of
the
World
Council
,
there
*NL*
are
words
cut
in
the
marble
,
which
we
-LCB-
+
are
required
to
+
-RCB-
repeat
to
*NL*
ourselves
whenever
we
are
-LSB-
-
tempted
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
WE
ARE
ONE
IN
ALL
AND
ALL
IN
ONE
.
*NL*
THERE
ARE
NO
MEN
BUT
ONLY
THE
GREAT
_
WE
_
,
*NL*
ONE
,
INDIVISIBLE
AND
FOREVER
.
''
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
tempted
:
--
``
We
are
one
in
all
and
all
in
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
no
men
but
only
the
great
WE
,
One
,
indivisible
and
forever
.
''
--
+
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
We
repeat
this
to
ourselves
,
but
it
helps
us
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
were
cut
long
ago
.
There
is
green
mould
in
the
*NL*
grooves
of
the
letters
and
yellow
streaks
-LSB-
-
on
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
in
+
-RCB-
the
marble
,
which
*NL*
come
from
more
years
than
men
could
count
.
And
these
words
are
*NL*
the
truth
,
for
they
are
written
on
the
Palace
of
the
World
*NL*
Council
,
and
the
World
Council
is
the
body
of
all
truth
.
Thus
has
*NL*
it
been
ever
since
the
Great
Rebirth
,
and
farther
back
than
that
*NL*
no
memory
can
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
must
never
speak
of
the
times
before
the
Great
Rebirth
,
*NL*
else
we
are
sentenced
to
three
years
in
the
Palace
of
Corrective
*NL*
Detention
.
It
is
only
the
Old
Ones
who
whisper
about
it
in
the
*NL*
evenings
,
in
the
Home
of
the
Useless
.
They
whisper
many
strange
*NL*
things
,
of
the
towers
which
rose
to
the
sky
,
in
those
*NL*
Unmentionable
Times
,
and
of
the
wagons
which
moved
without
*NL*
horses
,
and
of
the
lights
which
burned
without
flame
.
But
those
*NL*
times
were
evil
.
And
those
times
passed
away
,
when
men
saw
the
*NL*
Great
Truth
which
is
this
:
that
all
men
are
one
and
that
there
is
*NL*
no
will
save
the
will
of
all
men
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
men
are
good
and
wise
.
It
is
only
we
,
Equality
7-2521
,
we
*NL*
alone
who
were
born
with
a
curse
.
For
we
are
not
like
our
*NL*
brothers
.
And
as
we
look
back
upon
our
life
,
we
see
that
it
has
*NL*
ever
been
thus
and
that
it
has
brought
us
step
by
step
to
our
*NL*
last
,
supreme
transgression
,
our
-LSB-
-
crime
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
crimes
+
-RCB-
of
crimes
hidden
here
*NL*
under
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
remember
the
Home
of
the
Infants
where
we
lived
till
we
were
*NL*
five
years
old
,
together
with
all
the
children
of
the
City
who
*NL*
had
been
born
in
the
same
year
.
The
sleeping
halls
there
were
*NL*
white
and
clean
and
bare
of
all
things
save
one
hundred
beds
.
We
*NL*
were
just
like
all
our
brothers
then
,
save
for
the
one
*NL*
transgression
:
we
fought
with
our
brothers
.
There
are
few
*NL*
offenses
blacker
than
to
fight
with
our
brothers
,
at
any
age
and
*NL*
for
any
cause
whatsoever
.
The
Council
of
the
Home
told
us
so
,
and
*NL*
of
all
the
children
of
that
year
,
we
were
locked
in
the
cellar
*NL*
most
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
five
years
old
,
we
were
sent
to
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Students
,
where
there
are
ten
wards
,
for
our
ten
years
of
*NL*
learning
.
Men
must
learn
till
they
reach
their
fifteenth
year
.
*NL*
Then
they
go
to
work
.
In
the
Home
of
the
Students
we
arose
when
*NL*
the
big
bell
rang
in
the
tower
and
we
went
to
our
beds
when
it
*NL*
rang
again
.
Before
we
removed
our
garments
,
we
stood
in
the
great
*NL*
sleeping
hall
,
and
we
raised
our
right
arms
,
and
we
said
all
*NL*
together
with
the
three
Teachers
at
the
head
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
nothing
.
Mankind
is
all
.
By
the
grace
of
our
brothers
are
*NL*
we
allowed
our
lives
.
We
exist
through
,
by
and
for
our
brothers
*NL*
who
are
the
State
.
Amen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
slept
.
The
sleeping
halls
were
white
and
clean
and
bare
*NL*
of
all
things
save
one
hundred
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
,
Equality
7-2521
,
were
not
happy
in
those
years
in
the
Home
of
*NL*
the
Students
.
It
was
not
that
the
learning
was
too
hard
for
us
.
*NL*
It
was
that
the
learning
was
too
easy
.
This
is
a
great
sin
,
to
be
*NL*
born
with
a
head
which
is
too
quick
.
It
is
not
good
to
be
*NL*
different
from
our
brothers
,
but
it
is
evil
to
be
superior
to
*NL*
them
.
The
Teachers
told
us
so
,
and
they
frowned
when
they
looked
*NL*
upon
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
fought
against
this
curse
.
We
tried
to
forget
our
lessons
,
*NL*
but
we
always
remembered
.
We
tried
not
to
understand
what
the
-LSB-
-
Teachers
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
teachers
+
-RCB-
taught
,
but
we
always
understood
it
before
the
Teachers
*NL*
had
spoken
.
We
looked
upon
Union
-LSB-
-5
-3992
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+5
-3992
+
-RCB-
who
were
a
pale
boy
with
*NL*
only
half
a
brain
,
and
we
tried
to
say
and
do
as
they
did
,
that
*NL*
we
might
be
like
them
,
like
Union
5-3992
,
but
somehow
the
*NL*
Teachers
knew
that
we
were
not
.
And
we
were
lashed
more
often
*NL*
than
all
the
other
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Teachers
were
just
,
for
they
had
been
appointed
by
the
*NL*
Councils
,
and
the
Councils
are
the
-LSB-
-
voice
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
voices
+
-RCB-
of
all
justice
,
for
*NL*
they
are
the
voice
of
all
men
.
And
if
sometimes
,
in
the
secret
*NL*
darkness
of
our
heart
,
we
regret
that
which
befell
us
on
our
*NL*
fifteenth
birthday
,
we
know
that
it
was
through
our
own
guilt
.
We
*NL*
had
broken
a
law
,
for
we
had
not
paid
heed
to
the
words
of
our
*NL*
Teachers
.
The
Teachers
had
said
to
us
all
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dare
not
choose
in
your
minds
the
work
you
would
like
to
do
*NL*
when
you
leave
the
Home
of
the
Students
.
You
shall
do
*NL*
-LSB-
-
that
which
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
what
+
-RCB-
the
*NL*
Council
of
-LSB-
-
Vocations
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Vocation
+
-RCB-
shall
prescribe
for
you
.
For
the
Council
of
*NL*
Vocations
knows
in
its
great
wisdom
where
you
are
needed
by
your
*NL*
brother
men
,
better
than
you
can
know
it
in
your
unworthy
little
*NL*
minds
.
And
if
you
are
not
needed
by
your
brother
-LSB-
-
man
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
men
,
+
-RCB-
there
is
no
*NL*
reason
for
you
to
burden
the
earth
with
your
bodies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
knew
this
well
,
in
the
years
of
our
childhood
,
but
our
curse
*NL*
broke
our
will
.
We
were
guilty
and
we
confess
it
here
:
we
were
*NL*
guilty
of
the
great
Transgression
of
Preference
.
We
preferred
*NL*
some
work
and
some
lessons
to
the
others
.
We
did
not
listen
well
*NL*
to
the
history
of
all
the
Councils
elected
since
the
Great
*NL*
Rebirth
.
But
we
-LSB-
-
love
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
loved
+
-RCB-
the
Science
of
Things
.
We
wished
to
know
.
*NL*
We
wished
to
know
about
all
the
things
which
-LSB-
-
make
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
makes
+
-RCB-
the
earth
*NL*
around
us
.
We
asked
so
many
questions
that
the
Teachers
forbade
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
think
that
there
are
mysteries
in
the
*NL*
-LSB-
-
sky
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
sky
+
-RCB-
and
-LSB-
-
under
-
-RSB-
the
water
and
in
*NL*
the
plants
which
grow
.
But
the
Council
of
Scholars
has
said
that
*NL*
there
are
no
mysteries
,
and
the
Council
of
Scholars
knows
all
*NL*
things
.
And
we
learned
much
from
our
Teachers
.
We
learned
that
*NL*
the
earth
is
flat
and
that
the
sun
revolves
around
it
,
which
*NL*
causes
the
day
and
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
night
.
We
learned
the
names
of
all
the
winds
*NL*
which
blow
over
the
seas
and
push
the
sails
of
our
great
ships
.
*NL*
We
learned
how
to
bleed
men
to
cure
them
of
all
ailments
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
-LSB-
-
love
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
loved
+
-RCB-
the
Science
of
Things
.
And
in
the
darkness
,
in
the
*NL*
secret
hour
,
when
we
awoke
in
the
night
and
there
were
no
brothers
*NL*
around
us
,
but
only
their
shapes
in
the
beds
and
their
snores
,
*NL*
we
closed
our
eyes
,
and
we
held
our
lips
shut
,
and
we
*NL*
stopped
our
breath
,
that
no
shudder
might
let
our
brothers
see
or
*NL*
hear
or
guess
,
and
we
thought
that
we
wished
to
be
sent
to
the
*NL*
Home
of
the
Scholars
when
our
time
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
-LCB-
+
of
+
-RCB-
the
great
modern
inventions
come
from
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Scholars
,
such
as
the
newest
one
,
which
was
found
only
a
hundred
*NL*
years
ago
,
of
how
to
make
candles
from
wax
and
string
;
also
,
how
*NL*
to
make
glass
,
which
is
put
in
our
windows
to
protect
us
from
the
*NL*
rain
.
To
find
these
things
,
the
Scholars
must
study
the
earth
and
*NL*
learn
from
the
rivers
,
from
the
sands
,
from
the
winds
and
the
*NL*
rocks
.
And
if
we
went
to
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
,
we
could
learn
*NL*
from
these
also
.
We
could
ask
questions
of
these
,
for
they
do
not
*NL*
forbid
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
questions
give
us
no
rest
.
We
know
not
why
our
curse
makes
us
*NL*
seek
we
know
not
what
,
ever
and
ever
.
But
we
can
not
resist
it
.
It
*NL*
whispers
to
us
that
there
are
great
things
on
this
earth
of
ours
,
*NL*
and
that
we
-LSB-
-
can
know
them
*NL*
if
we
try
,
and
that
we
-
-RSB-
must
know
them
.
We
ask
,
why
must
we
know
,
but
it
has
*NL*
no
answer
to
give
us
.
We
must
know
that
we
may
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
wished
to
be
sent
to
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
.
We
wished
it
*NL*
so
much
that
our
hands
trembled
under
the
blankets
in
the
night
,
*NL*
and
we
bit
our
arm
to
stop
that
other
pain
which
we
could
not
*NL*
endure
.
It
was
evil
and
we
dared
not
face
our
brothers
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
For
men
may
wish
nothing
for
themselves
.
And
we
were
*NL*
punished
when
the
Council
of
Vocations
came
to
give
us
our
life
*NL*
Mandates
which
tell
those
who
reach
their
fifteenth
year
what
*NL*
their
work
is
to
be
for
the
rest
of
their
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Council
of
Vocations
came
-LCB-
+
in
+
-RCB-
on
the
first
day
of
spring
,
and
*NL*
they
sat
in
the
great
hall
.
And
we
who
were
fifteen
and
all
the
*NL*
Teachers
came
into
the
great
hall
.
And
the
Council
of
-LSB-
-
vocations
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Vocations
+
-RCB-
*NL*
sat
on
a
high
dais
,
and
they
had
but
two
words
to
speak
to
each
*NL*
of
the
Students
.
They
called
the
Students
'
names
,
and
when
the
-LSB-
-
Students
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
students
+
-RCB-
stepped
before
them
,
one
after
another
,
the
Council
*NL*
said
:
``
Carpenter
''
or
``
Doctor
''
or
``
Cook
''
or
``
Leader
.
''
Then
each
*NL*
Student
raised
their
right
arm
and
said
:
``
The
will
of
our
*NL*
brothers
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
the
Council
-LSB-
-
has
-
-RSB-
said
``
Carpenter
''
or
``
Cook
,
''
the
Students
so
*NL*
assigned
go
to
-LSB-
-
work
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
work
+
-RCB-
and
-LSB-
-
they
-
-RSB-
do
not
study
any
further
.
But
if
the
*NL*
Council
has
said
``
Leader
,
''
then
those
-LSB-
-
Students
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
students
+
-RCB-
go
into
the
Home
*NL*
of
the
Leaders
,
which
is
the
greatest
house
in
the
City
,
for
it
*NL*
has
three
stories
.
And
there
they
study
for
many
years
,
-LCB-
+
so
that
*NL*
they
may
become
candidates
+
-RCB-
and
be
elected
to
the
City
Council
and
*NL*
the
State
Council
and
the
World
Council
--
by
a
free
and
general
*NL*
vote
of
all
men
.
But
we
wished
not
to
be
a
Leader
,
even
though
it
*NL*
is
a
great
honor
.
We
wished
to
be
a
Scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
awaited
our
turn
in
the
great
hall
and
then
we
heard
the
*NL*
Council
of
Vocations
call
our
name
:
``
Equality
7-2521
.
''
We
walked
*NL*
to
the
dais
,
and
our
legs
did
not
tremble
,
and
we
looked
up
at
*NL*
the
-LCB-
+
Council
.
There
were
five
members
of
the
+
-RCB-
Council
,
three
of
the
*NL*
male
gender
and
two
of
the
female
.
Their
hair
was
white
and
their
*NL*
faces
were
cracked
as
the
clay
of
a
dry
river
bed
.
They
were
old
.
*NL*
They
seemed
older
than
the
marble
of
the
Temple
of
the
World
*NL*
Council
.
They
sat
before
us
and
they
did
not
move
.
And
we
saw
no
*NL*
breath
to
stir
the
folds
of
their
white
togas
.
But
we
knew
that
*NL*
they
were
alive
,
for
a
finger
of
the
hand
of
the
oldest
rose
,
*NL*
pointed
to
us
,
and
fell
down
again
.
This
was
the
only
thing
which
*NL*
moved
,
for
the
lips
of
the
oldest
did
not
move
as
they
said
:
*NL*
``
Street
Sweeper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
felt
the
cords
of
our
neck
grow
tight
as
our
head
rose
higher
*NL*
to
look
upon
the
faces
of
the
Council
,
and
we
were
happy
.
We
-LSB-
-
knew
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
know
+
-RCB-
*NL*
we
had
been
guilty
,
but
now
we
had
a
way
to
atone
for
it
.
We
*NL*
would
accept
our
Life
Mandate
,
and
we
would
work
for
our
*NL*
brothers
,
gladly
and
willingly
,
and
we
would
erase
our
sin
*NL*
against
them
,
which
they
did
not
know
,
but
we
knew
.
So
we
were
*NL*
happy
,
and
proud
of
ourselves
and
of
our
victory
over
ourselves
.
*NL*
We
raised
our
right
arm
and
we
spoke
,
and
our
voice
was
the
*NL*
clearest
,
the
steadiest
voice
in
the
hall
that
day
,
and
we
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
will
of
our
brothers
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
the
Council
,
but
their
*NL*
eyes
were
as
cold
-LCB-
+
as
+
-RCB-
blue
glass
buttons
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
went
into
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
.
It
is
a
grey
*NL*
house
on
a
narrow
street
.
There
is
a
sundial
in
its
courtyard
,
by
*NL*
which
the
Council
of
the
Home
can
tell
the
hours
of
the
day
and
*NL*
when
to
ring
the
bell
.
When
the
bell
rings
,
we
all
arise
from
our
*NL*
beds
.
-LSB-
-
They
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
The
+
-RCB-
sky
is
green
and
cold
in
our
windows
to
the
east
.
The
*NL*
shadow
on
the
sundial
marks
off
a
half-hour
while
we
dress
and
*NL*
eat
our
breakfast
in
the
dining
hall
,
where
there
are
five
long
*NL*
tables
with
twenty
clay
plates
and
twenty
clay
cups
on
each
*NL*
table
.
Then
we
go
to
work
in
the
streets
of
the
City
,
with
our
*NL*
brooms
and
our
rakes
.
In
five
hours
,
when
the
sun
is
high
,
we
*NL*
return
to
the
Home
and
we
eat
our
midday
meal
,
for
which
*NL*
one-half
hour
is
allowed
.
Then
we
go
to
work
again
.
In
five
*NL*
hours
,
the
shadows
are
blue
on
the
pavements
,
and
the
sky
is
blue
*NL*
with
a
deep
brightness
which
is
not
bright
.
We
come
back
to
have
*NL*
our
dinner
,
which
lasts
one
hour
.
Then
the
bell
rings
and
we
walk
*NL*
in
a
straight
column
to
one
of
the
City
Halls
,
for
the
Social
*NL*
Meeting
.
Other
columns
of
men
arrive
from
the
Homes
of
the
*NL*
different
Trades
.
The
candles
are
lit
,
and
the
Councils
of
the
*NL*
different
Homes
stand
in
a
pulpit
,
and
they
speak
to
us
of
our
*NL*
duties
and
of
our
brother
men
.
Then
visiting
Leaders
mount
the
*NL*
pulpit
and
they
read
to
us
the
speeches
which
were
made
in
the
*NL*
City
Council
that
day
,
for
the
City
Council
represents
all
men
*NL*
and
all
men
must
know
.
Then
we
sing
hymns
,
the
Hymn
of
*NL*
Brotherhood
,
and
the
Hymn
of
Equality
,
and
the
Hymn
of
the
*NL*
Collective
Spirit
.
The
sky
is
a
soggy
purple
when
we
return
to
*NL*
the
Home
.
Then
the
bell
rings
and
we
walk
in
a
straight
column
to
*NL*
the
City
Theatre
for
three
hours
of
Social
Recreation
.
There
a
*NL*
play
is
shown
upon
the
stage
,
with
two
great
choruses
from
the
*NL*
Home
of
the
Actors
,
which
speak
and
answer
all
together
,
in
two
*NL*
great
voices
.
The
plays
are
about
toil
and
how
good
it
is
.
Then
*NL*
we
walk
back
to
the
Home
-LSB-
-
is
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
in
+
-RCB-
a
straight
column
.
The
sky
is
like
a
*NL*
black
sieve
pierced
by
silver
drops
that
tremble
,
ready
to
burst
*NL*
through
.
The
moths
beat
against
the
street
lanterns
.
We
go
to
our
*NL*
beds
and
we
sleep
,
till
the
bell
rings
again
.
The
sleeping
halls
*NL*
are
white
and
clean
and
bare
of
all
things
save
one
hundred
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
have
we
lived
each
day
of
four
years
,
until
two
springs
ago
*NL*
when
our
crime
happened
.
Thus
must
all
men
live
until
they
are
*NL*
forty
.
At
forty
,
they
are
worn
out
.
At
forty
,
they
are
sent
to
*NL*
the
Home
of
the
Useless
,
where
the
Old
Ones
live
.
The
Old
Ones
do
*NL*
not
work
,
for
the
State
takes
care
of
them
.
They
sit
in
the
sun
*NL*
in
summer
and
they
sit
by
the
fire
in
winter
.
They
do
not
speak
*NL*
often
,
for
they
are
weary
.
The
Old
Ones
know
that
they
are
soon
*NL*
to
die
.
When
a
miracle
happens
and
some
live
to
be
forty-five
,
*NL*
they
are
the
*NL*
-LSB-
-
ancient
ones
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Ancient
Ones
,
+
-RCB-
and
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
children
stare
at
them
when
*NL*
passing
by
the
Home
of
the
Useless
.
Such
is
to
be
our
life
,
as
*NL*
that
of
all
our
brothers
and
of
the
brothers
who
came
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
would
have
been
our
life
,
had
we
not
committed
our
crime
*NL*
which
-LCB-
+
has
+
-RCB-
changed
all
things
for
us
.
And
it
was
our
curse
which
*NL*
drove
us
to
our
crime
.
We
had
been
a
good
Street
Sweeper
and
like
*NL*
all
our
brother
Street
Sweepers
,
save
for
our
cursed
wish
to
*NL*
know
.
We
looked
too
long
at
the
stars
at
night
,
and
at
the
trees
*NL*
and
the
earth
.
And
when
we
cleaned
the
yard
of
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Scholars
,
we
gathered
the
glass
vials
,
the
pieces
of
metal
,
the
*NL*
dried
bones
which
they
had
discarded
.
We
wished
to
keep
these
*NL*
things
and
to
study
them
,
but
we
had
no
place
to
hide
them
.
So
we
*NL*
carried
them
to
the
City
Cesspool
.
And
then
we
made
the
*NL*
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
day
of
the
spring
before
last
.
We
Street
Sweepers
*NL*
work
in
brigades
of
three
,
and
we
were
with
Union
5-3992
,
they
of
*NL*
the
-LSB-
-
half
brain
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
half-brain
,
+
-RCB-
and
with
International
4-8818
.
Now
Union
5-3992
*NL*
are
a
sickly
lad
and
sometimes
they
are
stricken
with
*NL*
convulsions
,
when
their
mouth
froths
and
their
eyes
turn
white
.
*NL*
But
International
4-8818
are
different
.
They
are
a
tall
,
strong
*NL*
youth
and
their
eyes
are
like
fireflies
,
for
there
is
laughter
in
*NL*
their
eyes
.
We
can
not
look
upon
International
4-8818
and
not
*NL*
smile
in
answer
.
For
this
they
were
not
liked
in
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Students
,
as
it
is
not
proper
to
smile
without
reason
.
And
also
*NL*
they
were
not
liked
because
they
took
pieces
of
coal
and
they
*NL*
drew
pictures
upon
the
walls
,
and
they
were
pictures
which
made
*NL*
men
laugh
.
But
it
is
only
our
brothers
in
the
Home
of
the
Artists
*NL*
who
are
permitted
to
draw
pictures
,
so
International
4-8818
were
*NL*
sent
to
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
,
like
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
International
4-8818
and
we
are
friends
.
This
is
an
evil
thing
to
*NL*
say
,
for
it
is
a
-LCB-
+
great
+
-RCB-
transgression
,
the
great
Transgression
of
*NL*
Preference
,
to
love
any
among
men
better
than
the
others
,
since
*NL*
we
must
love
all
men
and
all
men
are
our
friends
.
So
*NL*
International
4-8818
and
we
have
never
spoken
of
it
.
But
we
know
.
*NL*
We
know
,
when
we
look
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
And
when
we
look
*NL*
thus
without
-LSB-
-
words
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
works
,
+
-RCB-
we
both
know
other
things
also
,
strange
*NL*
things
for
which
there
are
no
words
,
and
these
things
frighten
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
on
that
day
of
the
spring
before
last
,
Union
5-3992
were
stricken
*NL*
with
convulsions
on
the
edge
of
the
City
,
near
the
City
Theatre
.
*NL*
We
left
them
to
lie
in
the
shade
of
the
Theatre
tent
and
*NL*
we
went
with
International
4-8818
to
finish
our
work
.
We
came
*NL*
together
to
the
great
ravine
behind
the
Theatre
.
It
is
empty
save
*NL*
for
trees
and
weeds
.
Beyond
the
ravine
there
is
a
plain
,
and
*NL*
beyond
the
plain
there
lies
the
Uncharted
Forest
,
about
which
men
*NL*
must
not
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
gathering
the
papers
and
the
rags
which
the
wind
had
*NL*
blown
from
the
Theatre
,
when
we
saw
an
iron
bar
among
the
weeds
.
*NL*
It
was
old
and
rusted
by
-LSB-
-
man
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
many
+
-RCB-
rains
.
We
pulled
with
all
our
*NL*
strength
,
but
we
could
not
move
it
.
So
we
called
International
-LSB-
-4
-8818
,
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+4
-8818
+
-RCB-
and
together
we
scraped
the
earth
around
the
bar
.
Of
a
*NL*
sudden
the
earth
fell
in
before
us
,
and
we
saw
an
old
iron
grill
*NL*
over
a
black
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
International
4-8818
stepped
back
.
But
we
pulled
at
the
grill
and
*NL*
it
gave
way
.
And
then
we
saw
iron
rings
as
steps
leading
down
a
*NL*
shaft
into
a
darkness
without
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
go
down
,
''
we
said
to
International
4-8818
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
forbidden
,
''
they
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
said
:
``
The
Council
does
not
know
of
this
hole
,
so
it
can
not
be
*NL*
forbidden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
answered
:
``
Since
the
Council
does
not
know
of
this
*NL*
hole
,
there
can
be
no
law
permitting
to
enter
it
.
And
everything
*NL*
which
is
not
permitted
by
law
is
forbidden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
said
:
``
We
shall
go
,
none
the
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
frightened
,
but
they
stood
by
and
watched
us
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
hung
on
the
iron
rings
with
our
hands
and
-LCB-
+
our
+
-RCB-
feet
.
We
could
*NL*
see
nothing
below
us
.
And
above
us
the
hole
-LSB-
-
open
-
-RSB-
upon
the
sky
grew
*NL*
smaller
and
smaller
,
till
it
came
to
be
the
size
of
a
button
.
But
*NL*
still
we
went
down
.
Then
our
foot
touched
the
ground
.
We
rubbed
*NL*
our
eyes
,
for
we
could
not
see
.
Then
our
eyes
became
used
to
the
*NL*
darkness
,
*NL*
-LSB-
-
but
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
and
+
-RCB-
we
could
not
believe
what
we
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
-LSB-
-
men
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
man
+
-RCB-
known
to
us
could
have
built
this
place
,
nor
the
men
known
*NL*
to
our
brothers
who
lived
before
us
,
and
yet
it
was
built
by
men
.
*NL*
It
was
a
great
tunnel
.
Its
walls
were
hard
and
smooth
to
the
*NL*
touch
;
it
felt
like
stone
,
but
it
was
not
stone
.
On
the
ground
*NL*
there
were
long
thin
tracks
of
iron
,
but
it
was
not
iron
;
it
felt
*NL*
smooth
and
cold
as
glass
.
We
knelt
,
and
we
crawled
forward
,
our
*NL*
hand
groping
along
the
iron
line
to
see
where
it
would
lead
.
But
*NL*
there
was
an
unbroken
night
ahead
.
Only
the
iron
tracks
glowed
*NL*
through
it
,
straight
and
white
,
calling
us
to
follow
.
But
we
*NL*
could
not
follow
,
for
we
were
losing
the
puddle
of
light
behind
*NL*
us
.
So
we
turned
and
we
crawled
back
,
our
hand
on
the
iron
line
.
*NL*
And
our
heart
beat
in
our
fingertips
,
without
reason
.
And
then
we
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
knew
suddenly
that
this
place
was
left
from
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
*NL*
So
it
was
true
,
and
those
Times
had
been
,
and
all
the
wonders
*NL*
of
those
Times
.
Hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
years
ago
men
knew
*NL*
secrets
which
we
have
lost
.
And
we
thought
:
``
This
is
a
foul
*NL*
place
.
They
are
damned
who
touch
the
things
of
the
Unmentionable
*NL*
Times
.
''
But
our
hand
which
followed
the
track
,
as
we
crawled
,
*NL*
clung
to
the
iron
as
if
it
would
not
leave
it
,
as
if
the
skin
of
*NL*
our
hand
were
thirsty
and
begging
of
the
metal
some
secret
fluid
*NL*
beating
in
its
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
returned
to
the
earth
.
International
4-8818
looked
upon
us
and
*NL*
stepped
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Equality
7-2521
,
''
they
said
,
``
your
face
is
white
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
could
not
speak
and
we
stood
looking
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
backed
away
,
as
if
they
dared
not
touch
us
.
Then
they
*NL*
smiled
,
but
it
was
-LCB-
+
a
+
-RCB-
not
a
gay
smile
;
it
was
lost
and
pleading
.
*NL*
But
still
we
could
not
speak
.
Then
they
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
report
our
find
to
the
City
Council
and
both
of
us
*NL*
will
be
rewarded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
we
spoke
.
Our
voice
was
hard
and
there
was
no
mercy
in
*NL*
our
voice
.
We
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
not
report
our
find
to
the
City
Council
.
We
shall
not
*NL*
report
it
to
any
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
raised
their
hands
to
their
ears
,
for
never
had
they
heard
*NL*
such
words
as
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
International
4-8818
,
''
we
asked
,
``
will
you
report
us
to
the
*NL*
Council
and
see
us
lashed
to
death
before
your
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
straight
-LSB-
-
all
-
-RSB-
of
a
sudden
and
they
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
would
we
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
we
said
,
``
keep
silent
.
This
place
is
ours
.
This

*NL*
belongs
to
us
,

And

we
shall

also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
saw
that
-LSB-
-
they
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
eyes
of
International
4-8818
were
full
to
*NL*
the
lids
with
tears
-LCB-
+
with
tears
+
-RCB-
they
dared
not
-LSB-
-
drop
.
*NL*
They
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
drop
,
they
+
-RCB-
*NL*
whispered
,
and
their
voice
trembled
,
so
that
their
words
lost
all
*NL*
shape
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
will
of
the
Council
is
above
all
things
,
for
it
is
the

*NL*
of

which
is
holy
.
But
if
you
wish
it
so
,
we
shall
*NL*
obey

Rather
shall
we
be
evil
with

than
good
with
all
our

brothers
.
May
the

have
mercy
upon
both
our

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
walked
away
together
and
back
to
the
Home
of
the
Street
*NL*
Sweepers
.
And
we
walked
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
it
come
to
pass
that
each
night
,
when
the
stars
are
high
*NL*
and
the
Street
Sweepers
sit
in
the
City
Theatre
,
we
,
Equality
*NL*
7-2521
,
steal
out
and
run
through
the
darkness
to
our
place
.
It
*NL*
is
easy
to
leave
the
Theatre
;
when
the
candles
are
blown
-LSB-
-
out
-
-RSB-
and
the
*NL*
Actors
come
onto
the
stage
,
no
eyes
can
see
us
as
we
crawl
under
*NL*
our
seat
and
under
the
cloth
of
the
tent
.
-LSB-
-
Later
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Later
+
-RCB-
it
is
easy
to
*NL*
steal
through
the
shadows
and
fall
in
line
next
to
International
*NL*
4-8818
,
as
the
column
leaves
the
Theatre
.
It
is
dark
in
the
*NL*
streets
and
there
are
no
men
about
,
for
no
men
may
walk
through
*NL*
the
City
when
they
have
no
mission
to
walk
there
.
Each
night
,
we
*NL*
run
to
the
ravine
,
and
we
remove
the
stones
-LSB-
-
which
-
-RSB-
we
have
piled
upon
*NL*
the
iron
grill
to
hide
it
from
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
men
.
Each
night
,
for
three
hours
,
*NL*
we
are
under
the
earth
,
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
stolen
candles
from
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
,
we
*NL*
have
stolen
flints
and
knives
and
paper
,
and
we
have
brought
them
*NL*
to
this
place
.
We
have
stolen
glass
vials
and
powders
and
acids
*NL*
from
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
.
Now
we
sit
in
the
tunnel
for
three
*NL*
hours
each
night
and
we
study
.
We
melt
strange
metals
,
and
we
mix
*NL*
acids
,
and
we
cut
open
the
bodies
of
the
animals
which
we
find
in
*NL*
the
City
Cesspool
.
We
have
built
an
oven
of
the
bricks
we
*NL*
gathered
in
the
streets
.
We
burn
the
wood
we
find
in
the
ravine
.
*NL*
The
fire
flickers
in
the
oven
and
blue
shadows
dance
upon
the
*NL*
walls
,
and
there
is
no
sound
of
men
to
disturb
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
stolen
manuscripts
.
This
is
a
great
offense
.
Manuscripts
*NL*
are
precious
,
for
our
brothers
in
the
Home
of
the
Clerks
spend
*NL*
one
year
to
copy
one
single
script
in
their
clear
handwriting
.
*NL*
Manuscripts
are
rare
and
they
are
kept
in
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Scholars
.
So
we
sit
under
the
earth
and
we
read
the
stolen
*NL*
scripts
.
Two
years
have
passed
since
we
found
this
place
.
And
in
*NL*
these
two
years
we
have
learned
more
than
we
had
learned
in
the
*NL*
ten
years
of
the
Home
of
the
Students
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
learned
things
which
are
not
in
the
scripts
.
We
have
*NL*
solved
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
secrets
of
which
the
Scholars
have
no
knowledge
.
We
*NL*
have
come
to
see
how
great
is
the
unexplored
,
and
many
lifetimes
*NL*
will
not
bring
us
to
the
end
of
our
quest
.
-LSB-
-
But
we
*NL*
wish
no
end
to
our
quest
.
-
-RSB-
We
wish
nothing
,
save
*NL*
to
be
alone
and
to
learn
,
and
to
feel
as
if
with
each
day
our
*NL*
sight
were
growing
sharper
than
the
hawk
's
and
clearer
than
rock
*NL*
crystal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
are
the
ways
of
evil
.
We
are
false
in
the
faces
of
our
*NL*
brothers
.
We
are
defying
the
will
of
our
Councils
.
We
alone
,
of
*NL*
the
thousands
who
walk
this
earth
,
we
alone
in
this
hour
are
*NL*
doing
a
work
which
has
no
purpose
save
that
we
wish
to
do
it
.
The
*NL*
evil
of
our
crime
is
not
for
the
human
mind
to
probe
.
The
nature
*NL*
of
our
punishment
,
if
it
be
discovered
,
is
not
-LCB-
+
free
+
-RCB-
for
the
human
*NL*
heart
to
ponder
.
Never
,
not
in
the
memory
of
the
Ancient
Ones
'
*NL*
Ancients
,
never
have
men
done
-LSB-
-
that
*NL*
which
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
what
+
-RCB-
we
are
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
there
is
no
shame
in
us
and
no
regret
.
We
say
to
*NL*
ourselves
that
we
are
a
wretch
and
a
traitor
.
But
we
feel
no
*NL*
burden
upon
our
spirit
and
no
fear
in
our
heart
.
And
it
seems
to
*NL*
us
that
our
spirit
is
clear
as
a
lake
troubled
by
no
eyes
save
those
*NL*
of
the
sun
.
And
in
our
-LSB-

heart
--
*NL*
strange
-
-RSB-

strange

-RCB-
are

*NL*
We
wish

write
this
name
.
We
wish
to
speak
it
,
but
we
dare
not
*NL*
speak
it
above
a
whisper
.
For
men
are
forbidden
to
take
notice
of
*NL*
women
,
and
women
are
forbidden
to
take
notice
of
men
.
But
we
*NL*
think
of
one
among
women
,
they
whose
name
is
Liberty
5-3000
,
and
*NL*
we
think
of
no
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
who
have
been
assigned
to
work
the
soil
live
in
the
*NL*
Homes
of
the
Peasants
beyond
the
City
.
Where
the
City
ends
there
*NL*
is
a
great
road
winding
off
to
the
north
,
and
we
Street
Sweepers
*NL*
must
keep
this
road
clean
to
the
first
milepost
.
There
is
a
hedge
*NL*
along
the
road
,
and
beyond
the
hedge
lie
the
fields
.
The
fields
*NL*
are
black
and
ploughed
,
and
they
lie
like
a
great
fan
before
us
,
*NL*
with
their
furrows
gathered
in
some
hand
beyond
the
sky
,
*NL*
spreading
forth
from
that
hand
,
opening
wide
apart
as
they
come
*NL*
toward
us
,
like
black
pleats
that
sparkle
with
thin
,
green
*NL*
spangles
.
Women
work
in
the
fields
,
and
their
white
tunics
in
the
*NL*
wind
are
like
the
wings
of
sea-gulls
beating
over
the
black
*NL*
soil
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
-LSB-
-
is
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
it
+
-RCB-
was
that
we
saw
Liberty
5-3000
walking
along
the
*NL*
furrows
.
Their
body
was
straight
and
thin
as
a
blade
of
iron
.
*NL*
Their
eyes
were
dark
and
hard
and
glowing
,
with
no
fear
in
them
,
*NL*
no
kindness
and
no
guilt
.
Their
hair
was
golden
as
the
sun
;
their
*NL*
hair
flew
in
the
wind
,
shining
and
wild
,
as
if
it
defied
men
to
*NL*
restrain
it
.
They
threw
seeds
from
their
hand
as
if
they
deigned
*NL*
to
fling
a
scornful
gift
,
and
the
earth
was
a
beggar
under
their
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
still
;
for
the
first
time
-LSB-
-
did
-
-RSB-
we
know
fear
,
and
then
pain
.
*NL*
And
we
stood
still
that
we
might
not
spill
this
pain
more
*NL*
precious
than
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
heard
a
voice
from
the
others
call
their
name
:
``
Liberty
*NL*
5-3000
,
''
and
they
turned
and
walked
back
.
Thus
we
learned
their
*NL*
name
,
and
we
stood
watching
them
go
,
till
their
white
tunic
was
*NL*
lost
in
the
blue
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
following
day
,
as
we
came
to
the
northern
road
,
we
kept
*NL*
our
eyes
upon
Liberty
5-3000
in
the
field
.
And
each
day
*NL*
thereafter
we
knew
the
illness
of
waiting
for
our
hour
on
the
*NL*
northern
road
.
And
there
we
looked
at
Liberty
5-3000
each
day
.
We
*NL*
know
not
whether
they
looked
at
us
also
,
but
we
think
they
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
one
day
they
came
close
to
the
hedge
,
and
suddenly
they
*NL*
turned
to
us
.
They
turned
in
a
whirl
and
the
movement
of
*NL*
their
body
stopped
,
as
if
slashed
off
,
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
.
*NL*
They
stood
still
as
a
stone
,
and
they
looked
straight
upon
us
,
*NL*
straight
-LSB-
-
into
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
in
+
-RCB-
our
eyes
.
There
was
no
smile
on
their
face
,
and
no
*NL*
welcome
.
But
their
face
was
-LSB-
-
taut
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
taught
,
+
-RCB-
and
their
eyes
were
dark
.
*NL*
Then
they
turned
as
swiftly
,
and
they
walked
away
from
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
following
day
,
when
we
came
to
the
road
,
they
smiled
.
*NL*
They
smiled
to
us
and
for
us
.
And
we
smiled
in
answer
.
Their
head
*NL*
fell
back
,
and
their
arms
fell
,
as
if
their
arms
and
their
thin
*NL*
white
neck
were
stricken
suddenly
with
a
great
lassitude
.
They
*NL*
were
not
looking
upon
us
,
but
upon
the
sky
.
Then
they
glanced
at
*NL*
us
over
their
shoulder
,
*NL*
-LSB-
-
as
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
and
+
-RCB-
we
felt
as
if
a
hand
had
touched
our
*NL*
body
,
slipping
softly
from
our
lips
to
our
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
thereafter
,
we
greeted
each
other
with
our
eyes
.
We
*NL*
dared
not
speak
.
It
is
a
transgression
to
speak
to
men
of
other
*NL*
Trades
,
save
in
groups
at
the
Social
Meetings
.
But
once
,
standing
*NL*
at
the
hedge
,
we
raised
our
hand
to
our
forehead
and
then
moved
*NL*
it
slowly
,
palm
down
,
toward
Liberty
5-3000
.
Had
the
others
seen
*NL*
it
,
they
could
have
guessed
nothing
,
for
it
looked
only
as
if
we
*NL*
were
shading
our
eyes
from
the
sun
.
But
Liberty
5-3000
saw
it
and
*NL*
understood
.
They
raised
their
hand
to
their
forehead
and
moved
it
*NL*
as
we
had
.
Thus
,
each
day
,
we
greet
Liberty
5-3000
,
and
they
*NL*
answer
,
and
no
men
can
suspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
wonder
at
this
new
sin
of
ours
.
It
is
our
second
*NL*
Transgression
of
Preference
,
for
we
do
not
think
of
all
our
*NL*
brothers
,
as
we
must
,
but
only
of
one
,
and
their
name
is
Liberty
*NL*
5-3000
.
We
do
not
know
why
we
think
of
them
.
We
-LSB-
-
do
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
don
+
-RCB-
not
know
why
,
*NL*
when
we
think
of
them
,
we
feel
-LSB-
-
all
-
-RSB-
of
a
sudden
that
the
earth
is
good
*NL*
and
that
it
is
not
a
burden
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
think
of
them
as
Liberty
5-3000
any
longer
.
We
have
*NL*
given
them
a
name
in
our
thoughts
.
We
call
them
the
Golden
One
.
*NL*
But
it
is
a
sin
to
give
men
-LCB-
+
other
+
-RCB-
names
which
distinguish
them
*NL*
from
other
men
.
Yet
we
call
them
the
Golden
-LSB-
-
One
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
one
,
+
-RCB-
for
they
are
not
*NL*
like
the
others
.
The
Golden
One
are
not
like
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
take
no
heed
of
the
law
which
says
that
men
may
not
think
*NL*
of
women
,
save
at
the
Time
of
Mating
.
This
is
the
time
each
*NL*
spring
when
all
the
men
older
than
twenty
and
all
the
women
older
*NL*
than
eighteen
are
sent
for
one
night
to
the
City
Palace
of
*NL*
Mating
.
And
each
of
the
men
have
one
of
the
women
assigned
to
*NL*
them
*NL*
-LSB-
-
by
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
buy
+
-RCB-
the
Council
of
Eugenics
.
Children
are
born
each
winter
,
*NL*
but
women
never
see
their
children
and
children
never
know
their
*NL*
parents
.
Twice
have
we
been
sent
to
the
Palace
of
Mating
,
but
it
*NL*
is
an
ugly
and
shameful
matter
,
of
which
we
do
not
like
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
broken
so
many
laws
,
and
today
we
have
broken
one
more
.
-LSB-
-
Today
,
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
Today
+
-RCB-
we
spoke
to
the
Golden
One
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
women
were
far
off
in
the
field
,
when
we
stopped
at
the
*NL*
hedge
by
the
side
of
the
road
.
The
Golden
One
were
kneeling
alone
*NL*
at
the
moat
which
runs
through
the
field
.
And
the
drops
of
water
*NL*
falling
from
their
hands
,
as
they
raised
the
water
to
their
lips
,
*NL*
were
like
sparks
of
fire
in
the
sun
.
Then
the
Golden
One
saw
us
,
*NL*
and
they
did
not
move
,
kneeling
there
,
looking
at
us
,
and
circles
*NL*
of
light
played
upon
their
white
tunic
,
from
the
sun
on
the
water
*NL*
of
the
moat
,
and
one
sparkling
drop
fell
from
a
finger
of
their
*NL*
hand
held
as
frozen
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
Golden
One
rose
and
walked
to
the
hedge
,
as
if
they
had
*NL*
heard
a
command
in
our
eyes
.
The
two
other
Street
Sweepers
of
our
*NL*
brigade
were
a
hundred
paces
away
down
the
road
.
And
we
thought
*NL*
that
International
4-8818
would
not
betray
us
,
and
Union
5-3992
*NL*
would
not
understand
.
So
we
looked
straight
upon
the
-LSB-
-
Golden
One
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
golden
one
,
+
-RCB-
*NL*
and
we
saw
the
shadows
of
their
lashes
on
their
white
cheeks
and
*NL*
the
sparks
of
sun
on
their
lips
.
And
we
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
beautiful
,
Liberty
5-3000
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
face
did
not
move
and
they
did
not
avert
their
eyes
.
Only
*NL*
their
eyes
grew
wider
,
and
there
was
triumph
in
their
eyes
,
and
*NL*
it
was
not
triumph
over
us
,
but
over
things
we
could
not
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Equality
7-2521
,
''
we
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
one
of
our
brothers
,
Equality
7-2521
,
for
we
do
not
*NL*
wish
you
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
not
say
what
they
meant
,
for
there
are
no
words
for
their
*NL*
meaning
,
but
we
know
it
without
words
and
we
knew
it
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
we
answered
,
``
nor
are
you
one
of
our
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
see
us
among
scores
of
women
,
will
you
look
upon
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
look
upon
you
,
Liberty
5-3000
,
if
we
see
you
among
all
*NL*
the
women
of
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
Street
Sweepers
sent
to
different
parts
of
the
City
or
do
*NL*
they
always
work
in
the
same
places
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
always
work
in
the
same
places
,
''
we
answered
,
``
and
no
one
*NL*
will
take
this
road
away
from
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
eyes
,
''
they
said
,
``
are
not
like
the
eyes
of
any
among
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
,
without
cause
for
the
thought
which
came
to
us
,
we
*NL*
felt
cold
,
cold
to
our
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
we
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
understood
our
thought
,
for
they
lowered
their
eyes
for
the
*NL*
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventeen
,
''
they
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
sighed
,
as
if
a
burden
had
been
taken
from
us
,
for
we
had
*NL*
been
thinking
without
reason
of
the
Palace
of
Mating
.
And
we
*NL*
thought
that
we
would
not
let
the
Golden
One
be
sent
to
the
*NL*
Palace
.
How
to
prevent
it
,
how
to
bar
the
will
of
the
Councils
,
*NL*
we
knew
not
,
but
we
knew
suddenly
that
we
would
.
Only
we
do
not
*NL*
know
why
such
thought
came
to
us
,
for
these
ugly
matters
bear
no
*NL*
relation
to
us
and
the
Golden
One
.
What
relation
can
they
bear
?
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
without
reason
,
as
we
stood
there
by
the
hedge
,
we
felt
*NL*
our
lips
drawn
tight
with
hatred
,
a
sudden
hatred
for
all
our
*NL*
brother
men
.
And
the
Golden
One
saw
it
and
smiled
slowly
,
and
*NL*
there
was
in
their
smile
the
first
sadness
we
had
seen
in
them
.
*NL*
We
think
that
in
the
wisdom
of
women
the
Golden
One
had
*NL*
understood
more
than
we
can
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
three
of
the
sisters
in
the
field
appeared
,
coming
toward
*NL*
the
road
,
so
the
Golden
One
walked
away
from
us
.
They
took
the
*NL*
bag
of
seeds
,
and
they
threw
the
seeds
into
the
furrows
of
earth
*NL*
as
they
walked
away
.
But
the
seeds
flew
wildly
,
for
the
hand
of
*NL*
the
Golden
One
was
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
as
we
walked
back
to
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
,
we
felt
*NL*
that
we
wanted
to
sing
,
without
reason
.
So
we
were
reprimanded
*NL*
tonight
,
in
the
dining
hall
,
for
without
knowing
it
we
had
begun
*NL*
to
sing
aloud
some
tune
we
had
never
heard
.
But
it
is
not
proper
*NL*
to
sing
without
reason
,
save
at
the
Social
Meetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
singing
because
we
are
happy
,
''
we
answered
the
one
of
the
*NL*
Home
Council
who
reprimanded
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
are
happy
,
''
they
answered
.
``
How
else
can
men
be
when
*NL*
they
live
for
their
brothers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
sitting
here
in
our
tunnel
,
we
wonder
about
these
words
.
*NL*
It
is
forbidden
,
not
to
be
happy
.
For
,
as
it
has
been
explained
*NL*
to
us
,
men
are
free
and
the
earth
belongs
to
them
;
and
all
things
*NL*
on
earth
belong
to
all
men
;
and
the
will
of
all
men
together
is
*NL*
good
for
all
;
and
so
all
men
must
be
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
as
we
stand
at
night
in
the
great
hall
,
removing
our
garments
*NL*
for
sleep
,
we
look
upon
our
brothers
and
we
wonder
.
The
heads
of
*NL*
our
brothers
are
bowed
.
The
eyes
of
our
brothers
are
dull
,
and
*NL*
never
do
they
look
one
another
in
the
eyes
.
The
shoulders
of
our
*NL*
brothers
are
hunched
,
and
their
muscles
are
drawn
,
as
if
their
*NL*
bodies
were
shrinking
and
wished
to
shrink
out
of
sight
.
And
a
*NL*
word
steals
into
our
mind
,
as
we
look
upon
our
brothers
,
and
that
*NL*
word
is
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
fear
hanging
in
the
air
of
the
sleeping
halls
,
and
in
*NL*
the
air
of
the
streets
.
Fear
walks
through
the
-LSB-
-
City
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
city
,
+
-RCB-
fear
without
*NL*
name
,
without
shape
.
All
men
feel
it
and
none
dare
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
feel
it
also
,
when
we
are
in
the
Home
of
the
Street
Sweepers
.
*NL*
But
here
,
in
our
tunnel
,
we
feel
it
no
longer
.
The
air
is
pure
*NL*
under
the
ground
.
There
is
no
odor
of
men
.
And
these
three
hours
*NL*
give
us
strength
for
our
hours
above
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
body
is
betraying
us
,
for
the
Council
of
the
Home
looks
with
*NL*
suspicion
upon
us
.
It
is
not
good
to
feel
-LSB-
-
too
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
to
+
-RCB-
much
joy
nor
to
be
*NL*
glad
that
our
body
lives
.
For
we
matter
not
and
it
must
not
*NL*
matter
to
us
whether
we
live
or
die
,
which
is
to
be
as
our
*NL*
brothers
will
it
.
But
we
,
Equality
7-2521
,
are
glad
to
be
living
.
*NL*
If
this
is
a
vice
,
then
we
wish
no
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
our
brothers
are
not
like
us
.
All
is
not
well
with
our
*NL*
brothers
.
There
are
Fraternity
2-5503
,
a
quiet
boy
with
wise
,
*NL*
kind
eyes
,
who
cry
suddenly
,
without
reason
,
in
the
midst
of
day
*NL*
or
night
,
and
their
body
shakes
with
sobs
-LCB-
+
so
+
-RCB-
they
can
not
explain
.
*NL*
There
are
Solidarity
9-6347
,
who
are
a
bright
youth
,
without
fear
*NL*
in
the
day
;
but
they
scream
in
their
sleep
,
and
they
scream
:
*NL*
``
Help
us
!
Help
us
!
Help
us
!
''
into
the
night
,
in
a
voice
which
*NL*
chills
our
bones
,
but
the
Doctors
can
not
cure
Solidarity
9-6347
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
we
all
undress
at
night
,
in
the
dim
light
of
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
candles
,
our
*NL*
brothers
are
silent
,
for
they
dare
not
speak
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
their
minds
.
For
all
must
agree
with
all
,
and
they
can
not
know
if
*NL*
their
thoughts
are
the
thoughts
of
all
,
and
so
they
fear
to
*NL*
speak
.
And
they
are
glad
when
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
candles
are
blown
for
the
*NL*
night
.
But
we
,
Equality
7-2521
,
look
through
the
window
upon
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
there
is
peace
in
the
sky
,
and
cleanliness
,
and
dignity
.
*NL*
And
beyond
the
City
there
lies
the
plain
,
and
beyond
the
plain
,
*NL*
black
upon
the
black
sky
,
there
lies
the
Uncharted
Forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
wish
to
look
upon
the
Uncharted
Forest
.
We
do
not
wish
*NL*
to
think
of
it
.
But
ever
do
our
eyes
return
to
that
black
patch
*NL*
upon
the
sky
.
Men
never
enter
the
Uncharted
Forest
,
for
there
is
*NL*
no
power
to
explore
it
and
no
path
to
lead
among
its
ancient
*NL*
trees
which
stand
as
guards
of
fearful
secrets
.
It
is
whispered
*NL*
that
once
or
twice
in
a
hundred
years
,
one
among
the
men
of
the
*NL*
City
escape
alone
and
run
to
the
Uncharted
Forest
,
without
call
*NL*
or
reason
.
These
men
do
not
return
.
They
perish
from
hunger
and
*NL*
from
the
claws
of
the
wild
beasts
which
roam
the
Forest
.
But
our
*NL*
Councils
say
-LSB-
-
that
-
-RSB-
this
is
only
a
legend
.
We
have
heard
that
there
are
*NL*
many
Uncharted
Forests
over
the
land
,
among
the
Cities
.
*NL*
-LSB-
-
And
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
and
+
-RCB-
it
is
*NL*
whispered
that
they
have
grown
over
the
ruins
of
many
cities
of
*NL*
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
The
trees
have
swallowed
the
ruins
,
and
*NL*
the
bones
under
the
ruins
,
and
all
the
things
which
perished
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
we
look
upon
the
Uncharted
Forest
far
in
the
night
,
we
*NL*
think
of
the
secrets
of
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
And
we
wonder
*NL*
how
it
came
to
pass
that
these
secrets
were
lost
to
the
world
.
We
*NL*
have
heard
the
legends
of
the
great
fighting
,
in
which
many
men
*NL*
fought
on
one
side
and
only
a
few
on
the
other
.
These
few
were
*NL*
the
Evil
Ones
and
they
were
conquered
.
Then
great
fires
raged
*NL*
over
the
land
.
And
in
these
fires
the
Evil
Ones
were
-LCB-
+
burned
.
And
*NL*
the
fire
which
is
called
the
Dawn
of
the
Great
Rebirth
,
was
the
*NL*
Script
Fire
where
all
the
scripts
of
the
Evil
Ones
were
+
-RCB-
burned
,
*NL*
and
with
them
all
the
words
of
the
Evil
Ones
.
Great
mountains
of
*NL*
flame
stood
in
the
squares
of
the
Cities
for
three
months
.
Then
*NL*
came
the

What

*NL*
*NL*
May
the

have
mercy
upon
us

We
had
no
wish
to
write
such
*NL*
a
question
,
and
we
knew

were

We

We

*NL*
There
is
some
word
,
one
single
word
which
is
not
in
the
language
*NL*
of
men
,
but
which
-LSB-
-
had
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
has

-RCB-
been
.
And
this
is
the
Unspeakable
Word
,
*NL*
which
no
men
may
speak
nor
hear
.
But
sometimes
,
and
it
is
rare
,
*NL*
sometimes
,
somewhere
,
one
among
men
find
that
word
.
They
find
it
*NL*
upon
scraps
of
old
manuscripts
or
cut
into
the
fragments
of
*NL*
ancient
stones
.
But
when
they
speak
it
they
are
put
to
death
.
*NL*
There
is
no
crime
punished
by
death
in
this
world
,
save
this
one
*NL*
crime
of
speaking
the
Unspeakable
Word
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
seen
one
of
such
men
burned
alive
in
the
square
of
the
*NL*
City
.
And
it
was
a
sight
which
has
stayed
with
us
through
the
*NL*
years
,
and
it
haunts
us
,
and
follows
us
,
and
it
gives
us
no
rest
.
*NL*
We
were
a
child
then
,
ten
years
old
.
And
we
stood
in
the
great
*NL*
square
with
all
the
children
and
all
the
men
of
the
City
,
sent
to
*NL*
behold
the
burning
.
They
brought
the
Transgressor
out
into
the
*NL*
square
and
they
led
-LSB-
-
them
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
him
+
-RCB-
to
the
pyre
.
They
had
torn
out
the
tongue
*NL*
of
the
Transgressor
,
so
that
they
could
speak
no
longer
.
The
*NL*
Transgressor
were
young
and
tall
.
They
had
hair
of
gold
and
eyes
*NL*
blue
as
morning
.
They
walked
to
the
pyre
,
and
their
step
did
not
*NL*
falter
.
And
of
all
the
faces
on
that
square
,
of
all
the
faces
*NL*
which
shrieked
and
screamed
and
spat
curses
upon
them
,
-LSB-
-
their
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
theirs
+
-RCB-
was
*NL*
the
calmest
and
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
happiest
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
chains
were
wound
over
their
body
at
the
stake
,
and
a
*NL*
flame
set
to
the
pyre
,
the
Transgressor
looked
upon
the
City
.
*NL*
There
was
a
thin
thread
of
blood
running
from
the
corner
of
their
*NL*
mouth
,
but
their
lips
were
smiling
.
And
a
monstrous
thought
came
*NL*
to
us
then
,
which
has
never
left
us
.
We
had
heard
of
Saints
.
*NL*
There
are
the
Saints
of
Labor
,
and
the
Saints
of
the
Councils
,
*NL*
and
the
Saints
of
the
Great
Rebirth
.
But
we
had
never
seen
a
*NL*
Saint
nor
what
the
likeness
of
a
Saint
should
be
.
And
we
thought
*NL*
then
,
standing
in
the
square
,
that
the
likeness
of
a
Saint
was
*NL*
the
face
we
saw
before
us
in
the
flames
,
the
face
of
the
*NL*
Transgressor
of
the
Unspeakable
Word
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
flames
rose
,
a
thing
happened
which
no
eyes
saw
but
ours
,
*NL*
else
we
would
not
be
living
today
.
Perhaps
it
had
only
seemed
to
*NL*
us
.
But
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
eyes
of
the
Transgressor
had
*NL*
chosen
us
from
the
crowd
and
were
looking
straight
upon
us
.
There
*NL*
was
no
pain
in
their
eyes
and
no
knowledge
of
the
agony
of
their
*NL*
body
.
There
was
only
joy
in
them
,
and
pride
,
a
pride
holier
than
*NL*
-LCB-
+
it
+
-RCB-
is
fit
for
human
pride
to
be
.
And
it
seemed
as
if
these
eyes
*NL*
were
trying
to
tell
us
something
through
the
flames
,
to
send
into
*NL*
our
eyes
some
word
without
sound
.
And
it
seemed
as
if
these
eyes
*NL*
were
begging
us
to
gather
that
word
and
not
to
let
it
go
from
us
*NL*
and
from
the
earth
.
But
the
flames
rose
and
we
could
not
guess
*NL*
the
-LSB-
-
word
...
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
word
...
+
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
What

to

for

of

*NL*
We
,
Equality
7-2521
,
have
discovered
a
new
power
of
nature
.
And
*NL*
we
have
discovered
it
alone
,
and
we
-LSB-
-
alone
-
-RSB-
are
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
said
.
Now
let
us
be
lashed
for
it
,
if
we
must
.
The
Council
*NL*
of
Scholars
has
said
that
we
all
know
the
things
which
exist
and
*NL*
therefore
-LCB-
+
all
+
-RCB-
the
things
which
are
not
known
by
all
do
not
exist
.
*NL*
But
we
think
that
the
Council
of
Scholars
is
blind
.
The
secrets
*NL*
of
this
earth
are
not
for
all
men
to
see
,
but
only
for
those
who
*NL*
will
seek
them
.
We
know
,
for
we
have
found
a
secret
unknown
to
*NL*
all
our
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
know
not
what
this
power
is
nor
whence
-LSB-
-
is
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
it
+
-RCB-
comes
.
But
we
know
*NL*
its
nature
,
we
have
watched
it
and
worked
with
it
.
We
saw
it
*NL*
first
two
years
ago
.
One
night
,
we
were
cutting
open
the
body
of
*NL*
a
dead
frog
when
we
-LSB-
-
saw
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
say
+
-RCB-
its
leg
jerking
.
It
was
dead
,
yet
it
*NL*
moved
.
Some
power
unknown
to
men
was
making
it
move
.
We
could
not
*NL*
understand
it
.
Then
,
after
many
tests
,
we
found
the
answer
.
The
*NL*
frog
had
been
hanging
on
a
wire
of
copper
;
and
it
had
been
the
*NL*
metal
of
our
knife
which
had
sent
*NL*
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
a
+
-RCB-
strange
power
to
the
copper
*NL*
through
the
brine
of
the
frog
's
body
.
We
put
a
piece
of
copper
*NL*
and
a
piece
of
zinc
into
a
jar
of
brine
,
we
touched
a
wire
to
*NL*
them
,
and
there
,
under
our
fingers
,
was
a
miracle
which
had
never
*NL*
occurred
before
,
a
new
miracle
and
a
new
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
discovery
haunted
us
.
We
followed
it
in
preference
to
all
*NL*
our
studies
.
We
worked
with
it
,
we
tested
-LSB-
-
it
-
-RSB-
in
more
ways
than
we
*NL*
can
describe
,
and
each
step
was
-LSB-
-
as
-
-RSB-
another
miracle
unveiling
before
*NL*
us
.
We
came
to
know
that
we
had
found
the
greatest
power
on
*NL*
earth
.
For
it
defies
all
the
laws
known
to
men
.
It
makes
the
*NL*
needle
move
and
turn
on
the
compass
which
we
stole
from
the
Home
*NL*
of
the
Scholars
;
but
we
had
been
taught
,
when
still
a
child
,
that
*NL*
the
loadstone
points
to
the
north
and
-LSB-
-
that
-
-RSB-
this
is
a
law
which
nothing
*NL*
can
change
;
yet
our
new
power
defies
all
laws
.
We
found
that
it
*NL*
causes
lightning
,
and
never
have
men
known
what
causes
lightning
.
*NL*
In
thunderstorms
,
we
raised
a
tall
rod
of
iron
by
the
side
of
our
*NL*
hole
,
and
we
watched
it
from
below
.
We
have
seen
the
*NL*
-LSB-
-
lightning
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
lightening
+
-RCB-
*NL*
strike
it
again
and
again
.
And
now
we
know
that
metal
draws
the
*NL*
power
of
the
sky
,
and
that
metal
can
be
made
to
give
it
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
built
strange
things
with
this
discovery
of
ours
.
We
used
*NL*
for
it
the
copper
wires
which
we
found
here
under
the
ground
.
We
*NL*
have
walked
the
length
of
our
tunnel
,
with
a
candle
lighting
the
*NL*
way
.
We
could
go
no
farther
-LSB-
-
that
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
than
+
-RCB-
half
a
mile
,
for
earth
and
rock
*NL*
had
fallen
at
both
ends
.
But
we
gathered
all
the
things
we
found
*NL*
and
we
brought
them
to
our
work
place
.
We
found
strange
boxes
*NL*
with
bars
of
metal
inside
,
with
many
cords
and
strands
and
coils
*NL*
of
metal
.
We
found
wires
that
led
to
strange
little
globes
of
*NL*
glass
on
the
walls
;
they
contained
threads
of
metal
thinner
than
*NL*
a
spider
's
web
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
help
us
in
our
work
.
We
do
not
understand
them
,
but
*NL*
we
think
that
the
men
of
the
Unmentionable
Times
had
known
our
*NL*
power
of
the
sky
,
and
these
things
had
some
relation
to
it
.
We
do
*NL*
not
know
,
but
we
shall
learn
.
We
can
not
stop
now
,
even
though
it
*NL*
frightens
us
that
we
are
alone
in
our
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
single
one
can
possess
greater
wisdom
-LSB-
-
that
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
than
+
-RCB-
the
many
Scholars
*NL*
who
are
elected
by
all
men
for
their
wisdom
.
Yet
we
can
.
We
do
.
*NL*
We
have
fought
against
saying
it
,
but
now
it
is
said
.
We
do
not
*NL*
care
.
We
forget
all
men
,
all
laws
and
all
things
save
our
metals
*NL*
and
our
wires
.
So
much
is
still
to
be
learned
!
So
long
a
road
*NL*
lies
before
us
,
and
what
care
we
if
we
must
travel
it
alone
!

Many
days
passed
before
we
could
speak
to
the
Golden
One
again
.
*NL*
But
then
came
the
day
when
the
sky
turned
white
,
as
if
the
sun
*NL*
had
burst
and
spread
its
flame
in
the
air
,
and
the
fields
lay
*NL*
still
without
breath
,
and
the
dust
of
the
road
-LSB-

was
-
-RSB-

what

-RCB-
white
in

So
the

of

were
weary
,
and
they
tarried
over

their
work
,
and
they
were
far

But
the

Golden
-LSB-

One

-RSB-
-LCB-

one

stood
alone
at
the

We
stopped
and
we
*NL*
saw
that
their
eyes
,
so
hard
and
scornful
to
the
world
,
were
*NL*
looking
at

at

as

if

we

then
we

sides
,
the
palms
of
their
hands
*NL*
turned
to
us
,
as
if
their
body
were
delivered
in
submission
to
*NL*
our
eyes
.
And
we
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
raised
their
head
,
and
they
spoke
simply
and
gently
,
as
*NL*
if
they
wished
us
to
forget
some
anxiety
of
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
is
hot
,
''
they
said
,
``
and
you
have
worked
for
many
hours
*NL*
and
you
must
be
weary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

we
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
cooler
in

,
''
they
said
,
``
and
there
is

to
*NL*
drink
.
Are
you
thirsty
?

``

``

we

``

not
cross

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
bring
the
water
to
you
,
''
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
knelt
by
the
moat
,
they
gathered
water
in
their
two
*NL*
hands
,
they
rose
and
they
held
the
water
out
to
our
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
know
if
we
drank
that
water
.
We
only
knew
suddenly
that
*NL*
their
hands
were
empty
,
but
we
were
still
holding
our
lips
to
*NL*
their
hands
,
and
that
they
knew
-LSB-

it
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-

it
+
-RCB-
but
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
raised
our
head
and
stepped
back
.
For
we
did
not
understand
*NL*
what
had
made
us
do
this
,
and
we
were
afraid
to
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
Golden
One
stepped
back
,
and
stood
looking
upon
their
*NL*
hands
in
wonder
.
Then
the
Golden
One
moved
away
,
even
though
no
*NL*
others
were
coming
,
and
they
*NL*
-LSB-
-
moved
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-

moved

-RCB-
stepping
back
,
as

from

their

bent
before

as
if
they

could
not
lower
their

*NL*
Tonight
,
after
more
days
and
trials
than
we
can
count
,
we
*NL*
finished
building
a
strange
thing
,
from
the
remains
of
the
*NL*
Unmentionable
Times
,
a
box
of
glass
,
devised
to
give
forth
the
*NL*
power
of
the
sky
of
greater
strength
than
we
had
ever
achieved
*NL*
before
.
And
when
we
put
our
wires
to
this
box
,
when
we
closed
the
*NL*
current
--
the
wire
glowed
!
It
came
to
life
,
it
turned
red
,
and
a
*NL*
circle
of
light
lay
on
the
stone
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
,
and
we
held
our
head
in
our
hands
.
We
could
not
*NL*
conceive
of
that
which
we
had
created
.
We
had
touched
no
flint
,
*NL*
made
no
fire
.
Yet
here
was
light
,
light
that
-LSB-
-
come
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
came
+
-RCB-
from
nowhere
,
*NL*
light
from
the
heart
of
metal
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
blew
out
the
candle
.
Darkness
swallowed
us
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
left
around
us
,
nothing
save
night
and
a
thin
thread
of
flame
in
*NL*
it
,
as
a
crack
in
the
wall
of
a
prison
.
We
stretched
our
hands
to
*NL*
the
wire
,
and
we
saw
our
fingers
in
the
red
glow
.
We
could
not
*NL*
see
our
body
nor
feel
it
,
and
in
that
moment
nothing
existed
save
*NL*
our
two
hands
over
a
wire
glowing
in
a
black
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
thought
of
the
meaning
of
that
which
lay
before
us
.
We
*NL*
can
light
our
tunnel
,
and
the
City
,
and
all
the
Cities
of
the
*NL*
world
with
nothing
save
metal
and
wires
.
We
can
give
our
brothers
*NL*
a
new
light
,
cleaner
and
brighter
than
any
they
have
ever
known
.
*NL*
The
power
of
the
sky
can
be
made
to
do
men
's
bidding
.
There
are
*NL*
no
limits
to
its
secrets
and
its
might
,
and
it
can
be
made
to
*NL*
grant
us
anything
if
we
but
choose
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
knew
what
we
must
do
.
Our
discovery
is
too
great
for
us
*NL*
to
waste
our
time
in
sweeping
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
streets
.
We
must
not
keep
our
*NL*
secret
to
ourselves
,
nor
buried
under
the
ground
.
We
must
bring
*NL*
it
into
the
sight
of
all
men
.
We
need
all
our
time
,
we
need
the
*NL*
work
rooms
of
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
,
we
want
the
help
of
our
*NL*
brother
Scholars
and
their
wisdom
joined
to
ours
.
There
is
so
*NL*
much
work
ahead
for
all
of
us
,
for
all
the
Scholars
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
month
,
the
World
Council
of
Scholars
is
to
meet
in
our
City
.
*NL*
It
is
a
great
Council
,
to
which
the
wisest
of
all
lands
are
*NL*
elected
,
and
it
meets
once
a
year
in
the
different
Cities
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
We
shall
go
to
this
Council
and
we
shall
lay
before
them
,
*NL*
as
our
gift
,
-LSB-
-
this
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
glass
box
with
the
power
of
the
sky
.
We
shall
*NL*
confess
everything
to
them
.
They
will
see
,
understand
and
*NL*
forgive
.
For
our
gift
is
greater
than
our
transgression
.
They
*NL*
will
explain
it
to
the
Council
of
Vocations
,
and
we
shall
be
*NL*
assigned
to
the
Home
of
the
Scholars
.
This
has
never
been
done
*NL*
before
,
but
neither
has
a
gift
such
as
ours
ever
been
offered
to
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
wait
.
We
must
guard
our
tunnel
as
we
had
never
guarded
it
*NL*
before
.
For
should
any
men
save
the
Scholars
learn
of
our
secret
,
*NL*
they
would
not
understand
it
,
nor
would
they
believe
us
.
They
would
*NL*
see
nothing
,
save
our
crime
of
working
alone
,
and
they
would
destroy
*NL*
us
and
our
light
.
We
care
not
about
our
body
,
but
our
light
-LSB-
-
is
...
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
is
...
+
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
we
do
care
.
For
the
first
time
-LSB-
-
do
-
-RSB-
we
-LCB-
+
do
+
-RCB-
care
about
our
body
.
*NL*
For
this
wire
is
-LSB-
-
as
-
-RSB-
a
part
of
our
body
,
as
a
vein
torn
from
us
,
*NL*
glowing
with
our
blood
.
Are
we
-LCB-
+
are
+
-RCB-
proud
of
this
thread
of
metal
,
*NL*
or
of
our
hands
which
made
it
,
or
is
there
a
line
to
divide
these
-LSB-
-
two
?
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
two
.
+
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
We
stretch
out
our
arms
.
For
the
first
time
do
we
know
how
strong
*NL*
our
arms
are
.
And
a
strange
thought
comes
to
us
:
we
wonder
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
in
our
life
,
what
we
look
like
.
Men
never
see
*NL*
their
own
faces
and
never
ask
their
brothers
about
it
,
for
it
is
*NL*
evil
to
have
concern
for
their
own
faces
or
bodies
.
But
tonight
,
*NL*
for
a
reason
we
can
not
fathom
,
we
wish
it
were
possible
to
us
to
*NL*
know
the
likeness
of
our
own
person
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
have
not
written
for
thirty
days
.
For
thirty
days
we
have
not
*NL*
been
here
,
in
our
tunnel
.
We
had
been
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
on
that
night
when
we
wrote
last
.
We
forgot
,
that
*NL*
night
,
to
watch
the
sand
in
the
glass
which
tells
us
when
three
*NL*
hours
have
passed
and
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
City
Theatre
.
*NL*
When
we
-LSB-
-
remembered
*NL*
it
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
remembered
,
+
-RCB-
the
sand
had
run
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
hastened
to
the
Theatre
.
But
the
big
tent
stood
grey
and
*NL*
silent
against
the
sky
.
The
streets
of
the
City
lay
before
us
,
*NL*
dark
and
empty
.
If
we
went
back
to
hide
in
our
tunnel
,
we
would
*NL*
be
found
and
our
light
*NL*
-LSB-
-
found
-
-RSB-
with
us
.
So
we
walked
to
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Street
Sweepers
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Council
of
the
Home
questioned
us
,
we
looked
upon
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
Council
,
but
there
was
no
curiosity
in
those
faces
,
*NL*
and
no
anger
,
and
no
mercy
.
So
when
the
oldest
of
them
asked
us
:
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
we
thought
of
our
glass
box
and
of
our
*NL*
light
,
and
we
forgot
all
else
.
And
we
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
not
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
oldest
did
not
question
us
further
.
They
turned
to
the
two
*NL*
youngest
,
and
said
,
and
their
voice
was
bored
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
our
brother
Equality
7-2521
to
the
Palace
of
Corrective
*NL*
Detention
.
Lash
them
until
they
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
we
were
taken
to
the
Stone
Room
under
the
Palace
of
Corrective
*NL*
Detention
.
This
room
has
no
windows
and
it
is
empty
save
for
an
*NL*
iron
post
.
Two
men
stood
by
the
post
,
naked
but
for
leather
*NL*
aprons
and
leather
hoods
over
their
faces
.
Those
who
had
brought
*NL*
us
departed
,
leaving
us
to
the
two
Judges
who
stood
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
room
.
The
-LSB-
-
Judges
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
judges
+
-RCB-
were
small
,
thin
men
,
grey
and
bent
.
*NL*
They
gave
the
signal
to
the
two
strong
hooded
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
tore
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
our
+
-RCB-
clothes
from
our
body
,
they
threw
us
down
upon
our
*NL*
knees
and
they
tied
our
hands
to
the
iron
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
blow
of
the
lash
felt
as
if
our
spine
had
been
cut
in
*NL*
two
.
The
second
blow
stopped
the
first
,
and
for
a
second
we
felt
*NL*
nothing
,
then
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
pain
struck
us
in
our
throat
and
fire
ran
in
our
*NL*
lungs
without
air
.
But
we
did
not
cry
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lash
whistled
like
a
singing
wind
.
We
tried
to
count
the
*NL*
blows
,
but
we
lost
count
.
We
knew
that
the
blows
were
falling
*NL*
upon
our
-LSB-
-
back
.
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
back
+
-RCB-
Only
we
felt
nothing
upon
our
back
any
longer
.
A
*NL*
flaming
grill
kept
dancing
before
our
eyes
,
and
we
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
save
that
grill
,
a
grill
,
a
grill
of
red
squares
,
and
*NL*
then
we
knew
that
we
were
looking
at
the
squares
of
the
iron
*NL*
grill
in
the
door
,
and
there
were
also
the
squares
of
stone
on
*NL*
the
walls
,
and
the
squares
which
the
lash
was
cutting
upon
our
*NL*
back
,
crossing
and
re-crossing
itself
in
our
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
saw
a
fist
before
us
.
It
knocked
our
chin
up
,
and
we
saw
*NL*
the
red
froth
of
our
mouth
on
the
withered
fingers
,
and
the
Judge
*NL*
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
jerked
our
head
away
,
hid
our
face
upon
our
tied
hands
,
*NL*
and
bit
our
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lash
whistled
again
.
We
wondered
who
was
sprinkling
burning
*NL*
coal
dust
upon
the
floor
,
for
we
saw
drops
of
red
twinkling
on
*NL*
the
stones
around
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
knew
nothing
,
save
two
voices
snarling
steadily
,
one
*NL*
after
the
other
,
even
though
we
knew
they
were
speaking
many
*NL*
minutes
apart
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
where
have
you
been
where
have
you
been
*NL*
where
have
you
been
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
our
lips
moved
,
but
the
sound
trickled
back
into
our
throat
,
*NL*
and
the
sound
was
only
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
light
...
The
light
...
The
light
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
opened
our
eyes
,
lying
on
our
stomach
on
the
brick
floor
of
a
*NL*
cell
.
We
looked
upon
two
hands
-LSB-
-
lying
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
flying
+
-RCB-
far
before
us
on
the
*NL*
bricks
,
and
we
moved
them
,
and
we
knew
that
they
were
our
hands
.
*NL*
But
we
could
not
move
our
body
.
Then
we
smiled
,
for
we
thought
of
*NL*
the
light
and
that
we
had
not
betrayed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lay
in
our
cell
for
many
days
.
The
door
opened
twice
each
day
,
*NL*
once
for
the
men
who
brought
us
bread
and
water
,
and
once
for
the
Judges
.
*NL*
Many
Judges
came
to
our
cell
,
first
the
humblest
and
then
the
most
*NL*
honored
Judges
of
the
City
.
They
stood
before
us
in
their
white
togas
,
*NL*
and
they
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
ready
to
speak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
shook
our
head
,
lying
before
them
on
the
floor
.
And
they
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
counted
each
day
and
each
night
as
it
passed
.
Then
,
tonight
,
*NL*
we
knew
that
we
must
escape
.
For
tomorrow
the
World
Council
of
*NL*
Scholars
is
to
meet
in
our
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
escape
from
the
Palace
of
Corrective
Detention
.
*NL*
The
locks
are
old
on
the
doors
and
there
are
no
guards
about
.
*NL*
There
is
no
reason
to
have
guards
,
for
men
have
never
defied
the
*NL*
Councils
so
far
as
to
escape
from
whatever
place
they
were
*NL*
ordered
to
be
.
Our
body
is
healthy
and
strength
returns
to
it
*NL*
speedily
.
We
-LSB-
-
lunged
*NL*
against
the
door
and
it
gave
way
.
We
-
-RSB-
stole
through
the
dark
passages
,
and
through
the
*NL*
dark
streets
,
and
down
into
our
tunnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lit
the
candle
and
we
saw
that
our
place
had
not
been
found
*NL*
and
nothing
had
been
touched
.
And
our
glass
box
stood
before
us
*NL*
on
the
cold
oven
,
as
we
had
left
it
.
What
matter
they
now
,
the
*NL*
scars
upon
our
back
!
*NL*
*NL*
Tomorrow
,
in
the
full
light
of
day
,
we
shall
take
our
box
,
and
*NL*
leave
our
tunnel
open
,
and
walk
through
the
streets
to
the
Home
*NL*
of
the
Scholars
.
We
shall
put
before
them
the
greatest
gift
ever
*NL*
offered
to
men
.
We
shall
tell
them
the
truth
.
We
shall
hand
to
*NL*
them
,
as
our
confession
,
these
pages
we
have
written
.
We
shall
*NL*
join
our
hands
to
theirs
,
and
we
shall
work
together
,
with
the
*NL*
power
of
the
sky
,
for
the
glory
of
mankind
.
Our
blessing
upon
*NL*
you
,
-LSB-
-
or
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
our
+
-RCB-
brothers
!
Tomorrow
,
you
will
take
us
back
into
your
*NL*
fold
and
we
shall
be
an
outcast
no
longer
.
Tomorrow
we
shall
be
*NL*
one
of
you
again
.
Tomorrow

It
is
dark
here
in
the
forest
.
The
leaves
rustle
over
our
head
,
*NL*
black
against
the
last
gold
of
the
sky
.
The
moss
is
soft
and
*NL*
warm
.
We
shall
sleep
on
this
moss
for
many
nights
,
till
the
*NL*
beasts
of
the
forest
come
to
tear
our
body
.
We
have
no
bed
now
,
*NL*
save
the
moss
,
and
no

,
save
the

*NL*
*NL*
We
are
old
now
,
yet
we
were
young
this
morning
,
when
we
carried
*NL*
our
glass
box
through
the
streets
of
the
City
to
the
Home
of
the
*NL*
Scholars
.
No
men
stopped
us
,
for
there
were
none
about
-LSB-
-
from
-
-RSB-
the
Palace
*NL*
of
Corrective
Detention
,
and
the
others
knew
nothing
.
No
men
*NL*
stopped
us
at
the
gate
.
We
walked
through
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
empty
passages
and
*NL*
into
the
great
hall
where
the
World
Council
of
Scholars
sat
in
*NL*
solemn
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
saw
nothing
as
we
entered
,
save
the
sky
in
the
great
windows
,
*NL*
blue
and
glowing
.
Then
we
saw
the
Scholars
who
sat
around
a
long
table
;
*NL*
they
were
as
shapeless
clouds
huddled
at
the
rise
of
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
a
+
-RCB-
great
sky
.
*NL*
There
were
-LCB-
+
the
+
-RCB-
men
whose
famous
names
we
knew
,
and
others
*NL*
from
distant
lands
whose
names
we
had
not
heard
.
We
saw
a
*NL*
great
painting
on
the
wall
over
their
heads
,
of
the
twenty
*NL*
illustrious
men
who
had
invented
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
heads
of
the
Council
turned
to
us
as
we
entered
.
These
*NL*
great
and
wise
of
the
earth
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
us
,
and
*NL*
they
looked
upon
us
with
wonder
and
curiosity
,
as
if
we
were
a
*NL*
miracle
.
It
is
true
that
our
tunic
was
torn
and
stained
with
*NL*
brown
stains
which
had
been
blood
.
We
raised
our
right
arm
and
we
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
greeting
to
you
,
our
honored
brothers
of
the
World
Council
*NL*
of
Scholars
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Collective
0-0009
,
the
oldest
and
wisest
of
the
Council
,
*NL*
spoke
and
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
our

?
For
you
do
not
look
like
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our

we
answered
,
``
and
we
are
a

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
-LSB-

is
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
it
+
-RCB-
was
-LSB-
-
as
-
-RSB-
if
a
great
wind
had
stricken
the
hall
,
for
all
the
*NL*
Scholars
spoke
at
once
,
and
they
were
angry
and
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Sweeper
!
A
Street
Sweeper
walking
in
upon

World
*NL*

to

It

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
knew
how
to
stop
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our

!
''
we
said
.
``
We
matter
not
,
nor
our
transgression

*NL*
It
is
only
our

who
matter

Give
no
thought
to
us
,
for
*NL*
we
are
nothing
,
but
listen
to
our
words
,
for
we
bring
you
a
gift
*NL*
such
as
-LSB-
-
had
-
-RSB-
-LCB-

has
+
-RCB-
never
been
brought

Listen
to
us
,
for
we
hold
*NL*
the
future
of
mankind
in
our
hands

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
placed
our
glass
box
-LSB-
-
upon
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
on
+
-RCB-
the
table
before
them
.
We
spoke
of
it
,
*NL*
and
of
our
long
quest
,
and
of
our
tunnel
,
and
of
our
escape
from
*NL*
the
Palace
of
Corrective
Detention
.
Not
a
hand
moved
in
that
*NL*
hall
,
as
we
spoke
,
nor
an
eye
.
Then
we
put
the
wires
to
the
box
,
*NL*
and
they
all
bent
forward
and
sat
still
,
watching
.
And
we
stood
*NL*
still
,
our
eyes
upon
the
wire
.
And
slowly
,
slowly
as
a
flush
of
*NL*
blood
,
a
red
flame
trembled
in
the
wire
.
Then
the
wire
glowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
terror
struck
the
men
of
the
Council
.
They
leapt
to
their
*NL*
feet
,
they
ran
from
the
table
,
and
they
stood
pressed
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
huddled
together
,
seeking
the
warmth
of
one
another
's
*NL*
bodies
to
give
them
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
upon
them
and
we
laughed
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fear
nothing

our

There
is
a

give

Still
they
would
not
move

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
give

we
cried

But
they
looked
upon
us
,
and
suddenly
we
were
afraid

For
their
*NL*
eyes
were
still
,
and
small
,
and
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

we
cried

not
to
be
flat
before
*NL*
us
,
but
as
if
it
were
leaping
up
to
meet
us
,
and
we
waited
for
*NL*
the
earth
to
rise
and
strike
us
in
the
face
.
But
we
ran
.
We
knew
*NL*
not
where
we
were
going
.
We
knew
only
that
we
must
run
,
run
to
*NL*
the
end
of
the
world
,
to
the
end
of
our
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
knew
suddenly
that
we
were
lying
on
a
soft
earth
and
that
*NL*
we
had
stopped
.
Trees
taller
than
we
had
ever
seen
before
stood
*NL*
over
us
in
-LCB-
+
a
+
-RCB-
great
silence
.
Then
we
knew
.
We
were
in
the
*NL*
Uncharted
Forest
.
We
had
not
thought
of
coming
here
,
but
our
legs
*NL*
had
carried
our
wisdom
,
and
our
legs
had
brought
us
to
the
*NL*
Uncharted
Forest
against
our
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
glass
box
lay
beside
us
.
We
crawled
to
it
,
we
fell
upon
it
,
*NL*
our
face
in
our
arms
,
and
we
lay
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
lay
-LSB-
-
this
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
thus
+
-RCB-
for
a
long
time
.
Then
we
rose
,
we
took
our
-LSB-
-
box
and
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
box
,
had
+
-RCB-
*NL*
walked
on
into
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
mattered
not
where
we
went
.
We
knew
that
men
would
not
follow
*NL*
us
,
for
they
never
-LSB-
-
enter
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
entered
+
-RCB-
the
Uncharted
Forest
.
We
had
nothing
*NL*
to
fear
from
them
.
The
forest
disposes
of
its
own
victims
.
This
*NL*
gave
us
no
fear
either
.
Only
we
wished
to
be
-LSB-
-
away
,
-
-RSB-
away
from
the
City
*NL*
and
-LSB-
-
from
-
-RSB-
the
air
that
touches
upon
the
air
of
the
City
.
So
we
walked
*NL*
on
,
our
box
in
our
arms
,
our
heart
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
doomed
.
Whatever
days
are
left
to
us
,
we
shall
spend
them
*NL*
alone
.
And
we
have
heard
of
the
corruption
to
be
found
in
*NL*
solitude
.
We
have
torn
ourselves
from
the
truth
which
is
our
*NL*
brother
men
,
and
there
is
no
road
back
for
us
,
and
no
redemption
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
know
these
things
,
but
we
do
not
care
.
We
care
for
nothing
on
*NL*
earth
.
We
are
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
glass
box
in
our
arms
is
like
a
living
heart
that
gives
*NL*
us
strength
.
We
have
lied
to
ourselves
.
We
have
not
built
this
*NL*
box
for
the
good
of
our
brothers
.
We
built
it
for
its
own
sake
.
*NL*
It
is
above
all
our
brothers
to
us
,
and
its
truth
above
their
*NL*
truth
.
Why
wonder
about
this
?
We
-LCB-
+
have
not
many
days
to
live
.
We
+
-RCB-
*NL*
are
walking
to
the
fangs
awaiting
us
somewhere
among
the
great
,
*NL*
silent
trees
.
There
is
not
a
thing
behind
us
to
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
blow
of
pain
struck
us
,
our
first
and
our
only
.
We
thought
*NL*
of
the
Golden
One
.
We
thought
of
the
Golden
One
whom
we
shall
*NL*
never
see
again
.
Then
the
pain
passed
.
It
is
best
.
We
are
one
of
*NL*
the
Damned
.
It
is
best
if
the
Golden
-LSB-
-
One
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
one
+
-RCB-
forget
our
name
and
the
*NL*

which
bore
that
name
.

-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
a
day
of
wonder
,
this
,
our
first
day
in
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
awoke
when
a
ray
of
sunlight
fell
across
our
face
.
We
wanted
*NL*
to
leap
to
our
feet
,
as
we
have
had
to
leap
-LCB-
+
to
our
feet
+
-RCB-
every
*NL*
morning
of
our
life
,
but
we
remembered
suddenly
that
no
bell
had
*NL*
rung
and
that
there
was
no
bell
to
ring
anywhere
.
We
lay
on
our
*NL*
back
,
we
threw
our
arms
out
,
and
we
looked
up
at
the
sky
.
The
*NL*
leaves
had
edges
of
silver
that
trembled
and
rippled
like
a
river
*NL*
of
green
and
fire
flowing
high
above
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
not
wish
to
move
.
We
thought
suddenly
that
we
could
lie
*NL*
thus
as
long
as
we
wished
,
and
we
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
.
*NL*
We
could
also
rise
,
or
run
,
or
leap
,
or
fall
down
again
.
We
were
*NL*
thinking
that
these
were
-LSB-
-
thoughts
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
things
+
-RCB-
without
sense
,
but
before
we
knew
-LSB-
-
it
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
it
,
+
-RCB-
our
body
had
risen
in
one
leap
.
Our
arms
stretched
out
of
*NL*
their
own
will
,
and
our
body
whirled
and
whirled
,
till
it
raised
*NL*
a
wind
to
rustle
through
the
leaves
of
the
bushes
.
Then
our
hands
*NL*
seized
a
branch
and
swung
us
high
into
a
tree
,
with
no
aim
save
*NL*
the
wonder
of
learning
the
strength
of
our
body
.
The
branch
*NL*
snapped
under
us
and
we
fell
upon
the
moss
that
was
soft
as
a
*NL*
cushion
.
Then
our
body
,
losing
all
sense
,
rolled
over
and
over
on
*NL*
the
moss
,
dry
leaves
in
our
tunic
,
in
our
hair
,
in
our
face
.
And
*NL*
we
heard
suddenly
that
we
were
laughing
,
laughing
aloud
,
laughing
*NL*
as
if
there
were
no
power
left
in
us
save
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
took
our
glass
box
,
and
we
went
-LSB-
-
on
-
-RSB-
into
the
forest
.
We
went
*NL*
on
,
cutting
through
the
branches
,
and
it
was
as
if
we
were
*NL*
swimming
through
a
sea
of
leaves
,
with
the
bushes
as
waves
rising
*NL*
and
falling
and
rising
around
us
,
and
flinging
their
green
sprays
*NL*
high
to
the
treetops
.
The
trees
parted
before
us
,
calling
us
*NL*
forward
.
The
forest
seemed
to
welcome
us
.
We
went
on
,
without
*NL*
thought
,
without
care
,
with
nothing
to
-LSB-
-
feel
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
fell
+
-RCB-
save
the
song
of
our
*NL*
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
when
we
felt
hunger
.
We
saw
birds
in
the
tree
*NL*
branches
,
and
flying
from
under
our
footsteps
.
We
picked
a
stone
*NL*
and
we
sent
-LSB-
-
is
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
it
+
-RCB-
as
an
arrow
at
a
bird
.
It
fell
before
us
.
We
made
*NL*
a
fire
,
we
cooked
the
bird
,
and
we
ate
it
,
and
no
meal
had
ever
*NL*
tasted
better
to
us
.
And
we
thought
suddenly
that
there
was
a
*NL*
great
satisfaction
to
be
found
in
the
food
which
we
need
and
*NL*
obtain
by
our
own
hand
.
And
we
wished
to
-LCB-
+
be
+
-RCB-
hungry
again
and
*NL*
soon
,
that
we
might
know
again
this
strange
new
pride
in
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
walked
on
.
And
we
came
to
a
stream
which
lay
as
a
streak
*NL*
of
glass
among
the
trees
.
It
lay
so
still
that
we
saw
no
water
*NL*
but
only
a
cut
in
the
earth
,
in
which
the
trees
grew
down
,
*NL*
upturned
,
and
the
sky
-LSB-
-
lay
-
-RSB-
at
the
bottom
.
We
knelt
by
the
stream
and
*NL*
we
bent
down
to
drink
.
And
then
we
stopped
.
For
,
upon
the
blue
of
*NL*
the
sky
below
us
,
we
saw
our
own
face
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
still
and
we
held
our
breath
.
For
our
face
and
our
body
*NL*
were
beautiful
.
Our
face
was
not
like
the
faces
of
our
brothers
,
*NL*
for
we
felt
-LSB-
-
not
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
no
+
-RCB-
pity
when
-LSB-
-
looking
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
we
looked
+
-RCB-
upon
it
.
Our
body
was
not
like
*NL*
the
bodies
of
our
brothers
,
for
our
limbs
were
straight
and
thin
*NL*
and
hard
and
strong
.
And
we
thought
that
we
could
trust
this
*NL*
being
who
looked
upon
us
from
the
stream
,
and
that
we
had
nothing
*NL*
to
fear
*NL*
-LSB-
-
with
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
from
+
-RCB-
this
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
walked
on
till
the
sun
had
set
.
When
the
shadows
gathered
*NL*
among
the
trees
,
we
stopped
in
a
hollow
between
the
roots
,
where
*NL*
we
shall
sleep
tonight
.
And
suddenly
,
for
the
first
time
this
*NL*
day
,
we
remembered
that
we
are
the
Damned
.
We
remembered
it
,
and
*NL*
we
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
writing
this
on
the
paper
we
had
hidden
in
our
tunic
*NL*
together
with
the
written
pages
we
had
brought
for
the
World
*NL*
Council
of
Scholars
,
but
never
given
to
them
.
We
have
much
to
*NL*
speak
of
to
ourselves
,
and
we
hope
we
shall
find
the
words
for
it
*NL*
in
the
days
to
come
.
Now
,
we
can
not
speak
,
for
we
can
not
*NL*
understand
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
have
not
written
for
many
days
.
We
did
not
wish
to
speak
.
For
*NL*
we
needed
no
words
to
remember
that
which
has
happened
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
our
second
day
in
the
forest
that
we
heard
steps
behind
*NL*
us
.
We
hid
in
the
bushes
,
and
we
waited
.
The
steps
came
closer
.
*NL*
And
then
we
saw
the
fold
of
a
white
tunic
among
the
trees
,
and
a
*NL*
gleam
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
leapt
forward
,
we
ran
to
them
,
and
we
stood
looking
upon
the
*NL*
Golden
One
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
us
,
and
their
hands
closed
into
fists
,
and
the
fists
*NL*
pulled
their
arms
down
,
as
if
they
wished
their
arms
to
hold
*NL*
them
,
while
their
body
swayed
.
And
they
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
dared
not
come
too
close
to
them
.
We
asked
,
and
our
voice
*NL*
trembled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
-LSB-

did
you
-

come

''
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-

But
they
whispered
only
:
+
-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
found

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
-LSB-

come

?
''
we
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
raised
their
head
,
and
there
was
a
great
pride
in
their
*NL*
voice
;
they
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
followed
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
could
not
speak
,
and
they
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
heard
that
you
had
gone
to
the

for

So
on
the
night
of
the
day
when
we
*NL*
heard
it
,
we
ran
away
from
the
Home
of
the
Peasants

We
found
the
*NL*
marks
of
your
feet
across
the
plain
where
no
men
walk
.
So
we
*NL*
followed
them
,
and
we
went
into
the
forest
,
and
we
followed
*NL*
the
path
where
the
branches
were
broken
by
your
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
white
tunic
was
torn
,
and
the
branches
had
cut
the
skin
of
*NL*
their
arms
,
but
they
spoke
as
if
they
had
never
taken
notice
of
*NL*
it
,
nor
of
weariness

nor
of
fear

*NL*
*NL*
``

If

You

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
upon
us
,
and
their
voice
was
low
,
but
there
was
*NL*
bitterness
and
triumph
in
their
-LSB-

voice
.
-
-RSB-
-LCB-

voice
:

-RCB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

but
our

neither

Your

but
our

*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
knelt
,
and
bowed
their
golden
head
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
never
thought
of
that
which
we
did

We
bent
to
raise
the
*NL*
Golden
One
to
their
feet
,
but
when
we
touched
them
,
it
was
as
if
*NL*
madness
had
stricken
us
.
We
seized
their
body
and
we
pressed
our
*NL*
lips
to
theirs
.
The
Golden
One
breathed
once
,
and
their
breath
*NL*
was
a
moan
,
and
then
their
arms
closed
around
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stood
together
for
a

And
we
were
frightened
that
we

had
lived
for
twenty-one
years
and
had
never
known
what
joy
is
*NL*
possible
to

*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our

Fear
nothing

There

Let

*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
walked
on
into
the
forest
,
their
hand
in
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
night
we
knew
that
to
hold
the
body
of
-LSB-
-
women
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
a
woman
+
-RCB-
in
our
*NL*
arms
is
neither
ugly
nor
shameful
,
but
the
one
ecstasy
granted
to
*NL*
the
race
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
walked
for
many
days
.
The
forest
has
no
end
,
and
we
seek
*NL*
no
end
.
But
each
day
added
to
the
chain
of
days
between
us
and
*NL*
the
City
is
like
an
added
blessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
made
a
bow
and
many
arrows
.
We
can
kill
more
birds
than
*NL*
we
need
for
our
food
;
we
find
water
and
fruit
in
the
forest
.
At
*NL*
night
,
we
choose
a
clearing
,
and
we
build
a
ring
of
fires
around
*NL*
it
.
We
sleep
in
the
midst
of
that
ring
,
and
the
beasts
dare
not
attack
us
.
*NL*
We
can
see
their
eyes
,
green
and
yellow
as
coals
,
watching
us
*NL*
from
the
tree
branches
beyond
.
The
fires
-LSB-
-
smoulder
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
smolder
+
-RCB-
as
a
crown
*NL*
of
jewels
around
us
,
and
smoke
stands
still
in
the
air
,
in
*NL*
columns
made
blue
by
the
moonlight
.
We
sleep
together
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
ring
,
the
arms
of
the
Golden
One
around
us
,
their
*NL*
head
upon
our
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
day
,
we
shall
stop
and
build
a
house
,
when
we
shall
have
*NL*
gone
far
enough
.
But
we
do
not
have
to
hasten
.
The
days
before
us
*NL*
are
without
end
,
like
the
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
can
not
understand
this
new
life
which
we
have
found
,
yet
it
*NL*
seems
so
clear
and
so
simple
.
When
questions
come
to
puzzle
us
,
*NL*
we
walk
faster
,
then
turn
and
forget
all
things
as
we
watch
the
*NL*
Golden
One
following
.
The
shadows
of
leaves
fall
upon
their
arms
,
*NL*
as
they
spread
the
branches
apart
,
but
their
shoulders
are
in
the
*NL*
sun
.
The
skin
of
their
arms
is
like
a
blue
-LSB-
-
mist
.
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
mist
,
+
-RCB-
but
their
*NL*
shoulders
are
white
and
glowing
,
as
if
the
light
fell
not
from
*NL*
above
,
but
rose
from
under
their
skin
.
We
watch
the
leaf
which
*NL*
has
fallen
upon
their
shoulder
,
and
it
lies
at
the
curve
of
their
*NL*
neck
,
and
a
drop
of
dew
glistens
upon
it
like
a
jewel
.
They
*NL*
approach
us
,
and
they
stop
,
laughing
,
knowing
what
we
think
,
and
*NL*
they
wait
obediently
,
without
questions
,
till
it
pleases
us
to
*NL*
turn
and
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
go
on
and
we
bless
the
earth
under
our
feet
.
But
questions
*NL*
come
to
us
again
,
as
we
walk
in
silence
.
If
that
which
we
have
*NL*
found
is
the
corruption
of
solitude
,
then
what
can
men
wish
for
*NL*
save
corruption
?
If
this
is
the
great
evil
of
being
alone
,
then
*NL*
what
is
good
and
what
is
evil
?
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
which
comes
from
the
many
is
good
.
Everything
which
*NL*
comes
from
one
is
evil
.
*NL*
-LSB-
-
This
have
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Thus
+
-RCB-
we
-LCB-
+
have
+
-RCB-
been
taught
with
our
first
*NL*
breath
.
We
have
broken
the
law
,
but
we
have
never
doubted
it
.
Yet
*NL*
now
,
as
we
walk
-LSB-
-
through
-
-RSB-
the
forest
,
we
are
learning
to
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
life
for
men
,
save
in
useful
toil
for
the
good
of
-LSB-
-
all
-
-RSB-
*NL*
their
brothers
.
But
we
lived
not
,
when
we
toiled
for
our
*NL*
brothers
,
we
were
only
weary
.
There
is
no
joy
for
men
,
save
the
*NL*
joy
shared
with
all
their
brothers
.
But
the
only
things
which
*NL*
taught
us
joy
were
the
power
-LSB-
-
we
-
-RSB-
created
in
our
wires
,
and
the
Golden
*NL*
One
.
And
both
these
joys
belong
to
us
alone
,
they
come
from
us
*NL*
alone
,
they
bear
no
relation
to
-LSB-
-
all
-
-RSB-
our
brothers
,
and
they
do
not
*NL*
concern
our
brothers
in
any
way
.
Thus
do
we
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
some
error
,
one
frightful
error
,
in
the
thinking
of
men
.
*NL*
What
is
that
error
?
We
do
not
know
,
but
the
knowledge
struggles
*NL*
within
us
,
struggles
to
be
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
Today
,
the
Golden
One
stopped
suddenly
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
-LCB-
+
then
+
-RCB-
they
frowned
and
shook
their
head
and
looked
at
us
*NL*
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
they
whispered
,
``
that
is
not
what
we
wished
to
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
,
then
they
spoke
slowly
,
and
their
words
were
*NL*
halting
,
like
the
words
of
a
child
learning
to
speak
for
the
*NL*
first
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
one
...
alone
...
and
only
...
and
we
love
you
who
*NL*
are
one
...
alone
...
and
only
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
into
each
other
's
eyes
and
we
knew
that
the
breath
of
a
*NL*
miracle
had
touched
us
,
and
fled
,
and
left
us
groping
vainly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
felt
torn
,
torn
for
some
word
we
could
not
find
.

*NL*
*NL*
We
are
sitting
at
a
table
and
we
are
writing
this
upon
paper
*NL*
made
thousands
of
years
ago
.
The
light
is
dim
,
and
we
can
not
see
*NL*
the
Golden
One
,
only
one
lock
of
gold
on
the
pillow
of
an
ancient
*NL*
bed
.
This
is
our
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
came
upon
it
today
,
at
sunrise
.
For
many
days
we
-LSB-
-
had
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
have
+
-RCB-
been
*NL*
crossing
a
chain
of
mountains
.
The
forest
rose
among
cliffs
,
and
*NL*
whenever
we
walked
out
upon
a
barren
stretch
of
rock
we
saw
great
*NL*
peaks
before
us
in
the
west
,
and
to
the
north
of
us
,
and
to
the
*NL*
south
,
as
far
as
our
eyes
could
see
.
The
peaks
were
red
and
*NL*
brown
,
with
the
green
streaks
of
forests
as
veins
upon
them
,
with
*NL*
blue
mists
as
veils
over
their
heads
.
We
had
never
heard
of
these
*NL*
mountains
,
nor
seen
them
marked
on
any
map
.
The
Uncharted
Forest
*NL*
has
protected
them
from
the
Cities
and
from
the
men
of
the
*NL*
Cities
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
climbed
paths
where
the
wild
goat
dared
not
follow
.
Stones
*NL*
rolled
from
under
our
feet
,
and
we
heard
them
striking
the
rocks
*NL*
below
,
farther
and
farther
down
,
and
the
mountains
rang
with
each
*NL*
stroke
,
and
long
after
the
strokes
had
died
.
But
we
went
on
,
for
*NL*
we
knew
that
no
men
would
ever
follow
our
track
nor
reach
us
*NL*
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
today
,
at
sunrise
,
we
saw
a
white
flame
among
the
trees
,
*NL*
high
on
a
sheer
peak
before
us
.
We
thought
that
it
was
a
fire
and
*NL*
-LCB-
+
we
+
-RCB-
stopped
.
But
the
flame
-LSB-
-
was
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
as
+
-RCB-
unmoving
,
yet
blinding
as
liquid
*NL*
metal
.
So
we
climbed
toward
it
through
the
rocks
.
And
there
,
*NL*
before
us
,
on
a
broad
summit
,
with
the
mountains
rising
behind
*NL*
it
,
stood
a
house
such
as
we
had
never
seen
,
and
the
white
fire
*NL*
came
from
the
sun
on
the
glass
of
its
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
two
stories
and
a
strange
roof
flat
as
a
floor
.
*NL*
There
was
more
window
than
wall
upon
its
walls
,
and
the
windows
*NL*
went
on
straight
around
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
corners
,
though
how
this
-LSB-
-
kept
the
-
-RSB-
house
-LCB-
+
kept
+
-RCB-
*NL*
standing
we
could
not
guess
.
The
walls
were
hard
and
smooth
,
of
*NL*
that
stone
unlike
stone
which
we
had
seen
in
our
tunnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
both
knew
it
without
words
:
this
house
was
left
from
*NL*
the
Unmentionable
Times
.
The
trees
had
protected
it
from
time
*NL*
and
weather
,
and
from
men
who
have
less
pity
than
time
and
weather
.
*NL*
We
turned
to
the
Golden
One
and
we
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
shook
their
head
.
So
we
walked
to
the
door
,
and
we
threw
*NL*
it
open
,
and
we
stepped
together
into
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Unmentionable
Times
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
need
the
days
and
the
years
ahead
,
to
look
,
to
-LSB-
-
learn
,
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
learn
+
-RCB-
and
*NL*
to
understand
the
things
of
this
house
.
Today
,
we
could
only
look
*NL*
and
try
to
believe
the
sight
of
our
eyes
.
We
pulled
the
heavy
*NL*
curtains
from
the
windows
and
we
saw
that
the
rooms
were
small
,
*NL*
and
we
thought
that
not
more
than
twelve
men
could
have
lived
*NL*
here
.
We
thought
it
strange
that
-LSB-
-
men
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
man
+
-RCB-
had
been
permitted
to
build
*NL*
a
house
for
only
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
we
seen
rooms
so
full
of
light
.
The
sunrays
danced
upon
*NL*
colors
,
colors
,
-LCB-
+
and
+
-RCB-
more
colors
-LSB-
-
that
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
than
+
-RCB-
we
thought
possible
,
we
who
*NL*
had
seen
no
houses
save
the
white
ones
,
the
brown
ones
and
the
*NL*
grey
.
There
were
great
pieces
of
glass
on
the
walls
,
but
it
was
*NL*
not
glass
,
for
when
we
looked
upon
it
we
saw
our
own
bodies
and
*NL*
all
the
things
behind
us
,
as
on
the
face
of
a
lake
.
There
were
*NL*
strange
things
which
we
had
never
seen
and
the
use
of
which
we
do
*NL*
not
know
.
And
there
were
globes
of
glass
everywhere
,
in
each
*NL*
room
,
the
globes
with
the
metal
cobwebs
inside
,
such
as
we
had
*NL*
seen
in
our
tunnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
the
sleeping
hall
and
we
stood
in
awe
upon
its
*NL*
threshold
.
For
it
was
a
small
room
and
there
were
only
two
beds
*NL*
in
it
.
We
found
no
other
beds
in
the
house
,
and
then
we
knew
that
*NL*
only
two
had
lived
here
,
and
this
passes
understanding
.
What
kind
*NL*
of
world
did
they
have
,
the
men
of
the
Unmentionable
Times
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
garments
,
and
the
Golden
One
gasped
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
them
.
For
they
were
not
white
tunics
,
nor
white
togas
;
they
were
*NL*
of
all
colors
,
no
two
of
them
alike
.
Some
crumbled
to
dust
as
we
*NL*
touched
*NL*
-LSB-
-
them
.
But
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
them
,
but
+
-RCB-
others
were
of
heavier
cloth
,
and
they
felt
*NL*
soft
and
new
in
our
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
found
a
room
with
walls
made
of
shelves
,
which
held
rows
of
*NL*
manuscripts
,
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
.
Never
had
we
seen
*NL*
such
a
number
of
them
,
nor
of
such
strange
shape
.
They
were
not
*NL*
soft
and
rolled
,
they
had
hard
shells
of
cloth
and
leather
;
and
*NL*
the
letters
on
their
pages
were
-LSB-
-
so
-
-RSB-
small
and
so
even
that
we
*NL*
wondered
at
the
men
who
had
such
handwriting
.
We
glanced
through
*NL*
the
pages
,
and
we
saw
that
they
were
written
in
our
language
,
but
*NL*
we
found
many
words
which
we
could
not
understand
.
Tomorrow
,
we
*NL*
shall
begin
to
read
these
scripts
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
seen
all
the
rooms
of
the
house
,
we
looked
at
the
*NL*
Golden
One
and
we
both
knew
the
thought
in
our
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
never
leave
this
house
,
''
we
said
,
``
nor
let
it
be
taken
*NL*
from
us
.
This
is
our
home
and
the
end
of
our
journey
.
This
is
your
house
,
*NL*
Golden
One
,
and
ours
,
and
it
belongs
to
no
other
men
whatever
*NL*
as
far
as
the
earth
may
stretch
.
We
shall
not
share
it
with
others
,
*NL*
as
we
share
not
our
joy
with
them
,
nor
our
love
,
nor
our
hunger
.
*NL*
So
be
it
to
the
end
of
our
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
will
be
done
,
''
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
we
went
out
to
gather
wood
for
the
great
hearth
of
our
home
.
*NL*
We
brought
water
from
the
stream
which
runs
among
the
trees
under
*NL*
our
windows
.
We
killed
a
mountain
goat
,
and
we
brought
its
flesh
*NL*
to
be
cooked
in
a
strange
copper
pot
we
found
in
a
place
of
*NL*
wonders
,
which
must
have
been
the
cooking
room
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
did
this
work
alone
,
for
no
words
of
ours
could
take
the
*NL*
Golden
One
away
from
the
big
glass
which
is
not
glass
.
They
stood
*NL*
before
it
and
they
looked
and
looked
upon
their
own
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sun
sank
beyond
the
mountains
,
the
Golden
One
fell
*NL*
asleep
on
the
floor
,
amidst
jewels
,
and
bottles
of
crystal
,
and
*NL*
flowers
of
silk
.
We
lifted
the
Golden
One
in
our
arms
and
we
*NL*
carried
them
to
a
bed
,
their
head
falling
softly
upon
our
*NL*
shoulder
.
Then
we
lit
a
candle
,
and
we
brought
paper
from
the
*NL*
room
of
the
manuscripts
,
and
we
sat
by
the
window
,
for
we
knew
*NL*
that
we
could
not
sleep
tonight

And
now
we

This

is
like
a

ready

a

*NL*
that
waits

It
seems
to
us
it
asks
a

from

a

a
*NL*
first
commandment

We
can
not

are

what
great
deed
this

expects
to
witness

We

It
seems
to

it

great
gifts
to
lay
before
-LSB-

us

but
it
wishes
a

for

us

We
are

We
are

We
look

we
beg
our

in
answering
this

call

spoken

yet
we
have
heard

We
look

We

the

of
centuries
,
the
dust
which
hid
-LSB-

the

great
*NL*
secrets
and
perhaps
great

And
yet
it
stirs
no

within

our

only
silent

This

I

I

*NL*
*NL*
It

the

It

*NL*
Many

Whatever

the

I

I

For
I

what

And
my

needs

*NL*
My

It

*NL*
*NL*
Neither

I

*NL*
I

This

*NL*
*NL*
I

The

flung

I

And
the

freedom

*NL*
I

I

*NL*
I

such

And
to
earn
my

my

must
*NL*
do
more
than

I
do
not
grant
my
love
without
*NL*
reason
,
nor
to
any
chance
passer-by
who
may
wish
to
claim
it

I
*NL*
honor
men
with
my

But
honor
is
a
thing
to
be
earned
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
choose
friends
among

but
neither

And
I

such

and

And
we
shall
join

when

when

For
in

each

is
alone

Let

keep

Then
let

join

if

*NL*
*NL*
For
the
word
``
We
''
must
never
be
spoken

save
by

and
*NL*
as
a

This

must
never

else
it
becomes
a

the

the

It

the

by
which
*NL*
the

by
which

What

my

if

can
reach

*NL*
What
is
my

if

It
was
when
I
read
the
first
of

books
I
found
in
my
house
*NL*
that
I
saw
the

``

when

the

fell
from

who

wept

understood

I

understood

had
been
my

and
my
*NL*
transgressions
;
and
why
I
had
never
felt

I
*NL*
understood
that
centuries
of
chains
and
lashes
will
not
kill
the

spirit

man
nor
the
sense
of
truth
within
him

*NL*
*NL*
I
read
-LCB-

many

books
for
many
days
.
Then
I
called
the
Golden
One
,
*NL*
and
I
told
her
what
I
had
read
and
what
I
had
learned
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
me
and
the
first
words
she
spoke
were
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
one
,
it
is
not
proper
for

be

names
.
*NL*
There
was
a
time
when
each

had
a
name
of
his
own
to
*NL*
distinguish
him
from
all
other
men
.
So
let
us
choose
our
names

I

have

lived

and
of

all
the

is

He
*NL*
took

and
-LSB-

he
-
-RSB-
brought
it
to
men
,
and
he
taught
*NL*
men
to
be
gods
.
And
he
suffered
for
his
deed
as
all
bearers
of
*NL*
light
must
suffer
.
His
name
was
Prometheus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
read
of

I
said
,
``
who
was
the
mother
of

the
earth
and
of
all

Her

was
Gaea

Let
this

Now

My

The

as

all

and
all

who
came

no

*NL*
what

they
gave
to
their

*NL*
*NL*
I

I

*NL*
the

which
are

but
closed

for

*NL*
I

my

the

power

they
called

It
was
the
power
that
moved

their

It
lit
this

light
-LSB-

which
-
-RSB-

that

came

I

produced
this

I
shall

how
*NL*

.
I
shall
learn
how

use
the

*NL*
carry

Then
I
shall
build
a

around
my

and
across
the

which
lead

a

Then

me
and
I
shall
lead
them
to
my
*NL*
fortress
.
And
here
,
in
this
uncharted
wilderness
,
I
and
they
,
my
*NL*
chosen
friends
,
my
fellow-builders
,
shall
write
the
first
chapter
*NL*
in
the
new
history
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
the
-LCB-
+
last
+
-RCB-
things
before
me
.
And
as
I
stand
here
at
the
*NL*
door
of
glory
,
I
look
behind
me
for
the
last
time
.
I
look
upon
*NL*
the
history
of
men
,
which
I
have
learned
from
the
books
,
and
I
*NL*
wonder
.
It
was
a
long
story
,
and
the
spirit
which
moved
it
was
*NL*
the
spirit
of
man
's
freedom
.
But
what
is
freedom
?
Freedom
from
*NL*
what
?
There
is
nothing
to
take
a
man
's
freedom
away
from
him
,
*NL*
save
other
men
.
To
be
free
,
a
man
must
be
free
of
his
brothers
.
*NL*
That
is
freedom
.
That
and
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
man
was
enslaved
by
the
gods
.
But
he
broke
their
*NL*
chains
.
-LSB-
-
The
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
Then
+
-RCB-
he
was
enslaved
by
the
kings
.
But
he
broke
their
*NL*
chains
.
He
was
enslaved
by
his
birth
,
by
his
kin
,
by
his
race
.
*NL*
But
he
broke
their
chains
.
He
declared
to
all
his
brothers
that
a
*NL*
man
has
rights
which
neither
god
nor
king
nor
other
men
can
take
*NL*
away
from
him
,
no
matter
what
their
number
,
for
his
is
the
right
*NL*
of
man
,
and
there
is
no
right
on
earth
above
this
right
.
And
he
*NL*
stood
on
the
threshold
of
-LSB-
-
the
-
-RSB-
freedom
for
which
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
centuries
behind
him
had
been
spilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
he
gave
up
all
he
had
won
,
and
fell
lower
than
his
*NL*
savage
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
brought
it
to
pass
?
What
disaster
took
their
reason
away
*NL*
from
men
?
What
whip
lashed
them
to
their
knees
in
shame
and
*NL*
submission
?
The
worship
of
the
word
``
We
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
men
accepted
that
worship
,
the
structure
-LCB-
+
of
centuries
*NL*
collapsed
about
them
,
the
structure
+
-RCB-
whose
every
beam
had
come
*NL*
from
the
thought
of
some
one
man
,
each
in
his
day
down
the
ages
,
*NL*
from
the
depth
of
some
one
spirit
,
such
-LSB-
-
spirit
-
-RSB-
as
-LCB-
+
spirit
+
-RCB-
existed
but
for
*NL*
its
own
sake
.
Those
men
who
-LSB-
-
survived
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
survived
-
+
-RCB-
those
eager
to
obey
,
eager
*NL*
to
live
for
one
another
,
since
they
had
nothing
else
to
vindicate
-LSB-
-
them
--
those
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
them
-
those
+
-RCB-
men
could
neither
carry
on
,
nor
preserve
what
they
*NL*
had
received
.
Thus
did
all
thought
,
all
science
,
all
wisdom
*NL*
perish
on
earth
.
Thus
did
-LSB-
-
men
--
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
men
-
+
-RCB-
men
with
nothing
to
offer
save
*NL*
their
great
-LSB-
-
number
--
*NL*
lost
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
numbers
-
lose
+
-RCB-
the
steel
towers
,
the
flying
ships
,
the
*NL*
power
wires
,
all
the
things
they
had
not
created
and
could
never
*NL*
keep
.
Perhaps
,
later
,
some
men
had
been
born
with
the
mind
and
*NL*
the
courage
to
recover
these
things
which
were
lost
;
perhaps
*NL*
these
men
came
before
the
Councils
of
Scholars
.
They
-LSB-
-
were
-
-RSB-
answered
as
*NL*
I
have
been
-LSB-
-
answered
--
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
answered
-
+
-RCB-
and
for
the
same
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
still
wonder
how
it
was
possible
,
in
those
graceless
years
*NL*
of
transition
,
long
ago
,
that
men
did
not
see
whither
they
were
*NL*
going
,
and
went
on
,
in
blindness
and
cowardice
,
to
their
fate
.
I
*NL*
wonder
,
for
it
is
hard
for
me
to
conceive
how
men
who
knew
the
word
-LSB-
-
``
I
''
-
-RSB-
-LCB-
+
``
I
,
''
+
-RCB-
*NL*
could
give
it
up
and
not
know
what
they
-LCB-
+
had
+
-RCB-
lost
.
But
such
has
been
*NL*
the
story
,
for
I
have
lived
in
the
City
of
the
damned
,
*NL*
and
I
know
what
horror
men
permitted
to
be
brought
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
,
in
those
days
,
there
were
a
few
among
men
,
a
few
of
*NL*
clear
sight
and
clean
soul
,
who
refused
to
surrender
that
word
.
*NL*
What
agony
must
have
been
theirs
before
that
which
they
saw
*NL*
coming
and
could
not
stop
!
Perhaps
they
cried
out
in
protest
and
*NL*
in
warning
.
But
men
paid
no
heed
to
their
warning
.
And
they
,
-LSB-
-
these
-
-RSB-
*NL*
-LCB-
+
those
+
-RCB-
few
,
fought
a
hopeless
battle
,
and
they
perished
with
their
*NL*
banners
smeared
by
their
own
blood
.
And
they
chose
to
perish
,
for
*NL*
they
knew
.
To
them
,
I
send
my
salute
across
the
centuries
,
and
my
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
-
Their
-
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
+
Theirs
+
-RCB-
is
the
banner
in
my
hand
.
And
I
wish
I
had
the
power
to
*NL*
tell
them
that
the
despair
of
their
hearts
was
not
to
be
final
,
*NL*
and
their
night
was
not
without
hope
.
For
the
battle
they
lost
*NL*
can
never
be
lost
.
For
that
which
they
died
to
save
can
never
*NL*
perish
.
Through
all
the
darkness
,
through
all
the
shame
of
which
*NL*
men
are
capable
,
the
spirit
of
man
will
remain
alive
on
this
*NL*
earth
.
It
may
sleep
,
but
it
will
awaken
.
It
may
wear
chains
,
but
*NL*
it
will
break
through
.
And
man
will
go
on
.
Man
,
not
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
-
Here
-
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-
+
Here
,
+
-RCB-
on
this
mountain
,
I
and
my
sons
and
my
chosen
friends
shall
*NL*
build
our
new
land
and
our
fort
.
And
it
will
become
as
the
heart
*NL*
of
the
earth
,
lost
and
hidden
at
first
,
but
beating
,
beating
*NL*
louder
each
day
.
And
word
of
it
will
reach
every
corner
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
And
the
roads
of
the
world
will
become
as
veins
which
will
*NL*
carry
the
best
of
the
world
's
blood
to
my
threshold
.
And
all
my
*NL*
brothers
,
and
the
Councils
of
my
brothers
,
will
hear
of
it
,
but
*NL*
they
will
be
impotent
against
me
.
And
the
day
will
come
when
I
*NL*
shall
break
-LSB-
-
all
-
-RSB-
the
chains
of
the
earth
,
and
raze
the
cities
of
the
*NL*
enslaved
,
and
my
home
will
become
the
capital
of
a
world
where
*NL*
each
man
will
be
free
to
exist
for
his
own
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
coming
of
that
day
-LSB-
-
shall
-
-RSB-
I
-LCB-
+
shall
+
-RCB-
fight
,
I
and
my
sons
and
my
*NL*
chosen
friends
.
For
the
freedom
of
Man
.
For
his
rights
.
For
his
*NL*
life
.
For
his
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
,
over
the
portals
of
my
fort
,
I
shall
cut
in
the
stone
*NL*
the
word
which
is
to
be
my
beacon
and
my
banner
.
The
word
which
*NL*
will
not
die
,
should
we
all
perish
in
battle
.
The
word
which
can
*NL*
never
die
on
this
earth
,
for
it
is
the
heart
of
it
and
the
*NL*
meaning
and
the
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sacred
word
:
*NL*
*NL*
EGO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
