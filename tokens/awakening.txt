A
green
and
yellow
parrot
,
which
hung
in
a
cage
outside
the
door
,
kept
*NL*
repeating
over
and
over
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allez
vous-en
!
Allez
vous-en
!
Sapristi
!
That
's
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
speak
a
little
Spanish
,
and
also
a
language
which
nobody
*NL*
understood
,
unless
it
was
the
mocking-bird
that
hung
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
door
,
whistling
his
fluty
notes
out
upon
the
breeze
with
*NL*
maddening
persistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
,
unable
to
read
his
newspaper
with
any
degree
of
comfort
,
*NL*
arose
with
an
expression
and
an
exclamation
of
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
down
the
gallery
and
across
the
narrow
``
bridges
''
which
*NL*
connected
the
Lebrun
cottages
one
with
the
other
.
He
had
been
seated
*NL*
before
the
door
of
the
main
house
.
The
parrot
and
the
mockingbird
were
*NL*
the
property
of
Madame
Lebrun
,
and
they
had
the
right
to
make
all
the
*NL*
noise
they
wished
.
Mr.
Pontellier
had
the
privilege
of
quitting
their
*NL*
society
when
they
ceased
to
be
entertaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
before
the
door
of
his
own
cottage
,
which
was
the
fourth
one
*NL*
from
the
main
building
and
next
to
the
last
.
Seating
himself
in
a
wicker
*NL*
rocker
which
was
there
,
he
once
more
applied
himself
to
the
task
of
*NL*
reading
the
newspaper
.
The
day
was
Sunday
;
the
paper
was
a
day
old
.
The
*NL*
Sunday
papers
had
not
yet
reached
Grand
Isle
.
He
was
already
acquainted
*NL*
with
the
market
reports
,
and
he
glanced
restlessly
over
the
editorials
*NL*
and
bits
of
news
which
he
had
not
had
time
to
read
before
quitting
New
*NL*
Orleans
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
wore
eye-glasses
.
He
was
a
man
of
forty
,
of
medium
height
*NL*
and
rather
slender
build
;
he
stooped
a
little
.
His
hair
was
brown
and
*NL*
straight
,
parted
on
one
side
.
His
beard
was
neatly
and
closely
trimmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
a
while
he
withdrew
his
glance
from
the
newspaper
and
looked
*NL*
about
him
.
There
was
more
noise
than
ever
over
at
the
house
.
The
main
*NL*
building
was
called
``
the
house
,
''
to
distinguish
it
from
the
cottages
.
*NL*
The
chattering
and
whistling
birds
were
still
at
it
.
Two
young
girls
,
*NL*
the
Farival
twins
,
were
playing
a
duet
from
``
Zampa
''
upon
the
piano
.
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
was
bustling
in
and
out
,
giving
orders
in
a
high
key
to
a
*NL*
yard-boy
whenever
she
got
inside
the
house
,
and
directions
in
an
equally
*NL*
high
voice
to
a
dining-room
servant
whenever
she
got
outside
.
She
was
*NL*
a
fresh
,
pretty
woman
,
clad
always
in
white
with
elbow
sleeves
.
Her
*NL*
starched
skirts
crinkled
as
she
came
and
went
.
Farther
down
,
before
*NL*
one
of
the
cottages
,
a
lady
in
black
was
walking
demurely
up
and
down
,
*NL*
telling
her
beads
.
A
good
many
persons
of
the
pension
had
gone
over
to
*NL*
the
Cheniere
Caminada
in
Beaudelet
's
lugger
to
hear
mass
.
Some
young
*NL*
people
were
out
under
the
wateroaks
playing
croquet
.
Mr.
Pontellier
's
*NL*
two
children
were
there
--
sturdy
little
fellows
of
four
and
five
.
A
*NL*
quadroon
nurse
followed
them
about
with
a
faraway
,
meditative
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
finally
lit
a
cigar
and
began
to
smoke
,
letting
the
paper
*NL*
drag
idly
from
his
hand
.
He
fixed
his
gaze
upon
a
white
sunshade
that
*NL*
was
advancing
at
snail
's
pace
from
the
beach
.
He
could
see
it
plainly
*NL*
between
the
gaunt
trunks
of
the
water-oaks
and
across
the
stretch
of
*NL*
yellow
camomile
.
The
gulf
looked
far
away
,
melting
hazily
into
the
blue
*NL*
of
the
horizon
.
The
sunshade
continued
to
approach
slowly
.
Beneath
its
*NL*
pink-lined
shelter
were
his
wife
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
and
young
Robert
*NL*
Lebrun
.
When
they
reached
the
cottage
,
the
two
seated
themselves
with
*NL*
some
appearance
of
fatigue
upon
the
upper
step
of
the
porch
,
facing
each
*NL*
other
,
each
leaning
against
a
supporting
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
folly
!
to
bathe
at
such
an
hour
in
such
heat
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
*NL*
Pontellier
.
He
himself
had
taken
a
plunge
at
daylight
.
That
was
why
the
*NL*
morning
seemed
long
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
burnt
beyond
recognition
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
his
wife
as
one
*NL*
looks
at
a
valuable
piece
of
personal
property
which
has
suffered
some
*NL*
damage
.
She
held
up
her
hands
,
strong
,
shapely
hands
,
and
surveyed
them
*NL*
critically
,
drawing
up
her
fawn
sleeves
above
the
wrists
.
Looking
at
*NL*
them
reminded
her
of
her
rings
,
which
she
had
given
to
her
husband
*NL*
before
leaving
for
the
beach
.
She
silently
reached
out
to
him
,
and
he
,
*NL*
understanding
,
took
the
rings
from
his
vest
pocket
and
dropped
them
*NL*
into
her
open
palm
.
She
slipped
them
upon
her
fingers
;
then
clasping
*NL*
her
knees
,
she
looked
across
at
Robert
and
began
to
laugh
.
The
rings
*NL*
sparkled
upon
her
fingers
.
He
sent
back
an
answering
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
Pontellier
,
looking
lazily
and
amused
from
one
to
*NL*
the
other
.
It
was
some
utter
nonsense
;
some
adventure
out
there
in
the
*NL*
water
,
and
they
both
tried
to
relate
it
at
once
.
It
did
not
seem
half
*NL*
so
amusing
when
told
.
They
realized
this
,
and
so
did
Mr.
Pontellier
.
He
*NL*
yawned
and
stretched
himself
.
Then
he
got
up
,
saying
he
had
half
a
mind
*NL*
to
go
over
to
Klein
's
hotel
and
play
a
game
of
billiards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
go
along
,
Lebrun
,
''
he
proposed
to
Robert
.
But
Robert
admitted
*NL*
quite
frankly
that
he
preferred
to
stay
where
he
was
and
talk
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
send
him
about
his
business
when
he
bores
you
,
Edna
,
''
instructed
*NL*
her
husband
as
he
prepared
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
take
the
umbrella
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
holding
it
out
to
him
.
He
*NL*
accepted
the
sunshade
,
and
lifting
it
over
his
head
descended
the
steps
*NL*
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
back
to
dinner
?
''
his
wife
called
after
him
.
He
halted
a
moment
*NL*
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
He
felt
in
his
vest
pocket
;
there
was
a
*NL*
ten-dollar
bill
there
.
He
did
not
know
;
perhaps
he
would
return
for
the
*NL*
early
dinner
and
perhaps
he
would
not
.
It
all
depended
upon
the
company
*NL*
which
he
found
over
at
Klein
's
and
the
size
of
``
the
game
.
''
He
did
not
*NL*
say
this
,
but
she
understood
it
,
and
laughed
,
nodding
good-by
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
children
wanted
to
follow
their
father
when
they
saw
him
starting
*NL*
out
.
He
kissed
them
and
promised
to
bring
them
back
bonbons
and
peanuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
eyes
were
quick
and
bright
;
they
were
a
yellowish
*NL*
brown
,
about
the
color
of
her
hair
.
She
had
a
way
of
turning
them
*NL*
swiftly
upon
an
object
and
holding
them
there
as
if
lost
in
some
inward
*NL*
maze
of
contemplation
or
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyebrows
were
a
shade
darker
than
her
hair
.
They
were
thick
and
*NL*
almost
horizontal
,
emphasizing
the
depth
of
her
eyes
.
She
was
rather
*NL*
handsome
than
beautiful
.
Her
face
was
captivating
by
reason
of
a
certain
*NL*
frankness
of
expression
and
a
contradictory
subtle
play
of
features
.
Her
*NL*
manner
was
engaging
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
rolled
a
cigarette
.
He
smoked
cigarettes
because
he
could
*NL*
not
afford
cigars
,
he
said
.
He
had
a
cigar
in
his
pocket
which
Mr.
*NL*
Pontellier
had
presented
him
with
,
and
he
was
saving
it
for
his
*NL*
after-dinner
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
quite
proper
and
natural
on
his
part
.
In
coloring
he
was
*NL*
not
unlike
his
companion
.
A
clean-shaved
face
made
the
resemblance
more
*NL*
pronounced
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
.
There
rested
no
shadow
of
*NL*
care
upon
his
open
countenance
.
His
eyes
gathered
in
and
reflected
the
*NL*
light
and
languor
of
the
summer
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
reached
over
for
a
palm-leaf
fan
that
lay
on
the
porch
*NL*
and
began
to
fan
herself
,
while
Robert
sent
between
his
lips
light
puffs
*NL*
from
his
cigarette
.
They
chatted
incessantly
:
about
the
things
around
*NL*
them
;
their
amusing
adventure
out
in
the
water
--
it
had
again
assumed
its
*NL*
entertaining
aspect
;
about
the
wind
,
the
trees
,
the
people
who
had
gone
*NL*
to
the
Cheniere
;
about
the
children
playing
croquet
under
the
oaks
,
and
*NL*
the
Farival
twins
,
who
were
now
performing
the
overture
to
``
The
Poet
and
*NL*
the
Peasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
talked
a
good
deal
about
himself
.
He
was
very
young
,
and
did
not
*NL*
know
any
better
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
talked
a
little
about
herself
for
the
*NL*
same
reason
.
Each
was
interested
in
what
the
other
said
.
Robert
spoke
of
*NL*
his
intention
to
go
to
Mexico
in
the
autumn
,
where
fortune
awaited
him
.
*NL*
He
was
always
intending
to
go
to
Mexico
,
but
some
way
never
got
there
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
held
on
to
his
modest
position
in
a
mercantile
house
in
*NL*
New
Orleans
,
where
an
equal
familiarity
with
English
,
French
and
Spanish
*NL*
gave
him
no
small
value
as
a
clerk
and
correspondent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
spending
his
summer
vacation
,
as
he
always
did
,
with
his
mother
*NL*
at
Grand
Isle
.
In
former
times
,
before
Robert
could
remember
,
``
the
*NL*
house
''
had
been
a
summer
luxury
of
the
Lebruns
.
Now
,
flanked
by
its
*NL*
dozen
or
more
cottages
,
which
were
always
filled
with
exclusive
visitors
*NL*
from
the
``
Quartier
Francais
,
''
it
enabled
Madame
Lebrun
to
maintain
the
*NL*
easy
and
comfortable
existence
which
appeared
to
be
her
birthright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
talked
about
her
father
's
Mississippi
plantation
and
her
*NL*
girlhood
home
in
the
old
Kentucky
bluegrass
country
.
She
was
an
American
*NL*
woman
,
with
a
small
infusion
of
French
which
seemed
to
have
been
lost
in
*NL*
dilution
.
She
read
a
letter
from
her
sister
,
who
was
away
in
the
East
,
*NL*
and
who
had
engaged
herself
to
be
married
.
Robert
was
interested
,
and
*NL*
wanted
to
know
what
manner
of
girls
the
sisters
were
,
what
the
father
*NL*
was
like
,
and
how
long
the
mother
had
been
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Pontellier
folded
the
letter
it
was
time
for
her
to
dress
for
*NL*
the
early
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
Leonce
is
n't
coming
back
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
glance
in
the
*NL*
direction
whence
her
husband
had
disappeared
.
Robert
supposed
he
was
*NL*
not
,
as
there
were
a
good
many
New
Orleans
club
men
over
at
Klein
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Pontellier
left
him
to
enter
her
room
,
the
young
man
descended
*NL*
the
steps
and
strolled
over
toward
the
croquet
players
,
where
,
*NL*
during
the
half-hour
before
dinner
,
he
amused
himself
with
the
little
*NL*
Pontellier
children
,
who
were
very
fond
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eleven
o'clock
that
night
when
Mr.
Pontellier
returned
from
*NL*
Klein
's
hotel
.
He
was
in
an
excellent
humor
,
in
high
spirits
,
and
very
*NL*
talkative
.
His
entrance
awoke
his
wife
,
who
was
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
*NL*
when
he
came
in
.
He
talked
to
her
while
he
undressed
,
telling
her
*NL*
anecdotes
and
bits
of
news
and
gossip
that
he
had
gathered
during
the
*NL*
day
.
From
his
trousers
pockets
he
took
a
fistful
of
crumpled
bank
*NL*
notes
and
a
good
deal
of
silver
coin
,
which
he
piled
on
the
bureau
*NL*
indiscriminately
with
keys
,
knife
,
handkerchief
,
and
whatever
else
*NL*
happened
to
be
in
his
pockets
.
She
was
overcome
with
sleep
,
and
answered
*NL*
him
with
little
half
utterances
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
it
very
discouraging
that
his
wife
,
who
was
the
sole
object
*NL*
of
his
existence
,
evinced
so
little
interest
in
things
which
concerned
*NL*
him
,
and
valued
so
little
his
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
had
forgotten
the
bonbons
and
peanuts
for
the
boys
.
*NL*
Notwithstanding
he
loved
them
very
much
,
and
went
into
the
adjoining
*NL*
room
where
they
slept
to
take
a
look
at
them
and
make
sure
that
they
*NL*
were
resting
comfortably
.
The
result
of
his
investigation
was
far
from
*NL*
satisfactory
.
He
turned
and
shifted
the
youngsters
about
in
bed
.
One
of
*NL*
them
began
to
kick
and
talk
about
a
basket
full
of
crabs
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
returned
to
his
wife
with
the
information
that
Raoul
had
*NL*
a
high
fever
and
needed
looking
after
.
Then
he
lit
a
cigar
and
went
and
*NL*
sat
near
the
open
door
to
smoke
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
quite
sure
Raoul
had
no
fever
.
He
had
gone
to
*NL*
bed
perfectly
well
,
she
said
,
and
nothing
had
ailed
him
all
day
.
Mr.
*NL*
Pontellier
was
too
well
acquainted
with
fever
symptoms
to
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
He
assured
her
the
child
was
consuming
at
that
moment
in
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reproached
his
wife
with
her
inattention
,
her
habitual
neglect
of
the
*NL*
children
.
If
it
was
not
a
mother
's
place
to
look
after
children
,
whose
*NL*
on
earth
was
it
?
He
himself
had
his
hands
full
with
his
brokerage
*NL*
business
.
He
could
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
;
making
a
living
for
*NL*
his
family
on
the
street
,
and
staying
at
home
to
see
that
no
harm
befell
*NL*
them
.
He
talked
in
a
monotonous
,
insistent
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
sprang
out
of
bed
and
went
into
the
next
room
.
She
soon
*NL*
came
back
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
leaning
her
head
down
on
the
*NL*
pillow
.
She
said
nothing
,
and
refused
to
answer
her
husband
when
he
*NL*
questioned
her
.
When
his
cigar
was
smoked
out
he
went
to
bed
,
and
in
*NL*
half
a
minute
he
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
by
that
time
thoroughly
awake
.
She
began
to
cry
a
*NL*
little
,
and
wiped
her
eyes
on
the
sleeve
of
her
peignoir
.
Blowing
out
*NL*
the
candle
,
which
her
husband
had
left
burning
,
she
slipped
her
bare
*NL*
feet
into
a
pair
of
satin
mules
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
went
out
*NL*
on
the
porch
,
where
she
sat
down
in
the
wicker
chair
and
began
to
rock
*NL*
gently
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
then
past
midnight
.
The
cottages
were
all
dark
.
A
single
faint
*NL*
light
gleamed
out
from
the
hallway
of
the
house
.
There
was
no
sound
*NL*
abroad
except
the
hooting
of
an
old
owl
in
the
top
of
a
water-oak
,
and
*NL*
the
everlasting
voice
of
the
sea
,
that
was
not
uplifted
at
that
soft
*NL*
hour
.
It
broke
like
a
mournful
lullaby
upon
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
came
so
fast
to
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
eyes
that
the
damp
sleeve
of
*NL*
her
peignoir
no
longer
served
to
dry
them
.
She
was
holding
the
back
*NL*
of
her
chair
with
one
hand
;
her
loose
sleeve
had
slipped
almost
to
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
her
uplifted
arm
.
Turning
,
she
thrust
her
face
,
steaming
and
*NL*
wet
,
into
the
bend
of
her
arm
,
and
she
went
on
crying
there
,
not
caring
*NL*
any
longer
to
dry
her
face
,
her
eyes
,
her
arms
.
She
could
not
have
told
*NL*
why
she
was
crying
.
Such
experiences
as
the
foregoing
were
not
uncommon
*NL*
in
her
married
life
.
They
seemed
never
before
to
have
weighed
much
*NL*
against
the
abundance
of
her
husband
's
kindness
and
a
uniform
devotion
*NL*
which
had
come
to
be
tacit
and
self-understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
indescribable
oppression
,
which
seemed
to
generate
in
some
unfamiliar
*NL*
part
of
her
consciousness
,
filled
her
whole
being
with
a
vague
anguish
.
*NL*
It
was
like
a
shadow
,
like
a
mist
passing
across
her
soul
's
summer
day
.
*NL*
It
was
strange
and
unfamiliar
;
it
was
a
mood
.
She
did
not
sit
there
*NL*
inwardly
upbraiding
her
husband
,
lamenting
at
Fate
,
which
had
directed
*NL*
her
footsteps
to
the
path
which
they
had
taken
.
She
was
just
having
a
*NL*
good
cry
all
to
herself
.
The
mosquitoes
made
merry
over
her
,
biting
her
*NL*
firm
,
round
arms
and
nipping
at
her
bare
insteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
stinging
,
buzzing
imps
succeeded
in
dispelling
a
mood
which
*NL*
might
have
held
her
there
in
the
darkness
half
a
night
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
Mr.
Pontellier
was
up
in
good
time
to
take
the
*NL*
rockaway
which
was
to
convey
him
to
the
steamer
at
the
wharf
.
He
was
*NL*
returning
to
the
city
to
his
business
,
and
they
would
not
see
him
again
*NL*
at
the
Island
till
the
coming
Saturday
.
He
had
regained
his
composure
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
have
been
somewhat
impaired
the
night
before
.
He
was
*NL*
eager
to
be
gone
,
as
he
looked
forward
to
a
lively
week
in
Carondelet
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
gave
his
wife
half
of
the
money
which
he
had
brought
away
*NL*
from
Klein
's
hotel
the
evening
before
.
She
liked
money
as
well
as
most
*NL*
women
,
and
accepted
it
with
no
little
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
buy
a
handsome
wedding
present
for
Sister
Janet
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
smoothing
out
the
bills
as
she
counted
them
one
by
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
we
'll
treat
Sister
Janet
better
than
that
,
my
dear
,
''
he
laughed
,
as
*NL*
he
prepared
to
kiss
her
good-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
tumbling
about
,
clinging
to
his
legs
,
imploring
that
*NL*
numerous
things
be
brought
back
to
them
.
Mr.
Pontellier
was
a
great
*NL*
favorite
,
and
ladies
,
men
,
children
,
even
nurses
,
were
always
on
hand
to
*NL*
say
goodby
to
him
.
His
wife
stood
smiling
and
waving
,
the
boys
shouting
,
*NL*
as
he
disappeared
in
the
old
rockaway
down
the
sandy
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
a
box
arrived
for
Mrs.
Pontellier
from
New
Orleans
.
It
*NL*
was
from
her
husband
.
It
was
filled
with
friandises
,
with
luscious
*NL*
and
toothsome
bits
--
the
finest
of
fruits
,
pates
,
a
rare
bottle
or
two
,
*NL*
delicious
syrups
,
and
bonbons
in
abundance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
always
very
generous
with
the
contents
of
such
a
*NL*
box
;
she
was
quite
used
to
receiving
them
when
away
from
home
.
The
*NL*
pates
and
fruit
were
brought
to
the
dining-room
;
the
bonbons
were
passed
*NL*
around
.
And
the
ladies
,
selecting
with
dainty
and
discriminating
fingers
*NL*
and
a
little
greedily
,
all
declared
that
Mr.
Pontellier
was
the
best
*NL*
husband
in
the
world
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
forced
to
admit
that
she
knew
*NL*
of
none
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
a
difficult
matter
for
Mr.
Pontellier
to
define
to
*NL*
his
own
satisfaction
or
any
one
else
's
wherein
his
wife
failed
in
her
*NL*
duty
toward
their
children
.
It
was
something
which
he
felt
rather
than
*NL*
perceived
,
and
he
never
voiced
the
feeling
without
subsequent
regret
and
*NL*
ample
atonement
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
of
the
little
Pontellier
boys
took
a
tumble
whilst
at
play
,
he
*NL*
was
not
apt
to
rush
crying
to
his
mother
's
arms
for
comfort
;
he
would
*NL*
more
likely
pick
himself
up
,
wipe
the
water
out
of
his
eyes
and
the
*NL*
sand
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
go
on
playing
.
Tots
as
they
were
,
they
pulled
*NL*
together
and
stood
their
ground
in
childish
battles
with
doubled
*NL*
fists
and
uplifted
voices
,
which
usually
prevailed
against
the
other
*NL*
mother-tots
.
The
quadroon
nurse
was
looked
upon
as
a
huge
encumbrance
,
*NL*
only
good
to
button
up
waists
and
panties
and
to
brush
and
part
hair
;
*NL*
since
it
seemed
to
be
a
law
of
society
that
hair
must
be
parted
and
*NL*
brushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
not
a
mother-woman
.
The
mother-women
*NL*
seemed
to
prevail
that
summer
at
Grand
Isle
.
It
was
easy
to
know
them
,
*NL*
fluttering
about
with
extended
,
protecting
wings
when
any
harm
,
real
or
*NL*
imaginary
,
threatened
their
precious
brood
.
They
were
women
who
idolized
*NL*
their
children
,
worshiped
their
husbands
,
and
esteemed
it
a
holy
*NL*
privilege
to
efface
themselves
as
individuals
and
grow
wings
as
*NL*
ministering
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
them
were
delicious
in
the
role
;
one
of
them
was
the
embodiment
*NL*
of
every
womanly
grace
and
charm
.
If
her
husband
did
not
adore
her
,
*NL*
he
was
a
brute
,
deserving
of
death
by
slow
torture
.
Her
name
was
Adele
*NL*
Ratignolle
.
There
are
no
words
to
describe
her
save
the
old
ones
that
*NL*
have
served
so
often
to
picture
the
bygone
heroine
of
romance
and
the
*NL*
fair
lady
of
our
dreams
.
There
was
nothing
subtle
or
hidden
about
her
*NL*
charms
;
her
beauty
was
all
there
,
flaming
and
apparent
:
the
spun-gold
*NL*
hair
that
comb
nor
confining
pin
could
restrain
;
the
blue
eyes
that
were
*NL*
like
nothing
but
sapphires
;
two
lips
that
pouted
,
that
were
so
red
one
*NL*
could
only
think
of
cherries
or
some
other
delicious
crimson
fruit
in
*NL*
looking
at
them
.
She
was
growing
a
little
stout
,
but
it
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
detract
an
iota
from
the
grace
of
every
step
,
pose
,
gesture
.
One
would
*NL*
not
have
wanted
her
white
neck
a
mite
less
full
or
her
beautiful
arms
*NL*
more
slender
.
Never
were
hands
more
exquisite
than
hers
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
joy
to
look
at
them
when
she
threaded
her
needle
or
adjusted
her
gold
*NL*
thimble
to
her
taper
middle
finger
as
she
sewed
away
on
the
little
*NL*
night-drawers
or
fashioned
a
bodice
or
a
bib
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
was
very
fond
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
and
often
she
took
*NL*
her
sewing
and
went
over
to
sit
with
her
in
the
afternoons
.
She
was
*NL*
sitting
there
the
afternoon
of
the
day
the
box
arrived
from
New
Orleans
.
*NL*
She
had
possession
of
the
rocker
,
and
she
was
busily
engaged
in
sewing
*NL*
upon
a
diminutive
pair
of
night-drawers
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
brought
the
pattern
of
the
drawers
for
Mrs.
Pontellier
to
cut
*NL*
out
--
a
marvel
of
construction
,
fashioned
to
enclose
a
baby
's
body
so
*NL*
effectually
that
only
two
small
eyes
might
look
out
from
the
garment
,
*NL*
like
an
Eskimo
's
.
They
were
designed
for
winter
wear
,
when
treacherous
*NL*
drafts
came
down
chimneys
and
insidious
currents
of
deadly
cold
found
*NL*
their
way
through
key-holes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
mind
was
quite
at
rest
concerning
the
present
material
*NL*
needs
of
her
children
,
and
she
could
not
see
the
use
of
anticipating
and
*NL*
making
winter
night
garments
the
subject
of
her
summer
meditations
.
*NL*
But
she
did
not
want
to
appear
unamiable
and
uninterested
,
so
she
*NL*
had
brought
forth
newspapers
,
which
she
spread
upon
the
floor
of
the
*NL*
gallery
,
and
under
Madame
Ratignolle
's
directions
she
had
cut
a
pattern
*NL*
of
the
impervious
garment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
was
there
,
seated
as
he
had
been
the
Sunday
before
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
also
occupied
her
former
position
on
the
upper
step
,
leaning
*NL*
listlessly
against
the
post
.
Beside
her
was
a
box
of
bonbons
,
which
she
*NL*
held
out
at
intervals
to
Madame
Ratignolle
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
lady
seemed
at
a
loss
to
make
a
selection
,
but
finally
settled
upon
*NL*
a
stick
of
nougat
,
wondering
if
it
were
not
too
rich
;
whether
it
could
*NL*
possibly
hurt
her
.
Madame
Ratignolle
had
been
married
seven
years
.
About
*NL*
every
two
years
she
had
a
baby
.
At
that
time
she
had
three
babies
,
and
*NL*
was
beginning
to
think
of
a
fourth
one
.
She
was
always
talking
about
her
*NL*
``
condition
.
''
Her
``
condition
''
was
in
no
way
apparent
,
and
no
one
would
*NL*
have
known
a
thing
about
it
but
for
her
persistence
in
making
it
the
*NL*
subject
of
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
started
to
reassure
her
,
asserting
that
he
had
known
a
lady
who
*NL*
had
subsisted
upon
nougat
during
the
entire
--
but
seeing
the
color
mount
*NL*
into
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
face
he
checked
himself
and
changed
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
though
she
had
married
a
Creole
,
was
not
thoroughly
*NL*
at
home
in
the
society
of
Creoles
;
never
before
had
she
been
thrown
so
*NL*
intimately
among
them
.
There
were
only
Creoles
that
summer
at
Lebrun
's
.
*NL*
They
all
knew
each
other
,
and
felt
like
one
large
family
,
among
*NL*
whom
existed
the
most
amicable
relations
.
A
characteristic
which
*NL*
distinguished
them
and
which
impressed
Mrs.
Pontellier
most
forcibly
*NL*
was
their
entire
absence
of
prudery
.
Their
freedom
of
expression
was
*NL*
at
first
incomprehensible
to
her
,
though
she
had
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
reconciling
it
with
a
lofty
chastity
which
in
the
Creole
woman
seems
to
*NL*
be
inborn
and
unmistakable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
would
Edna
Pontellier
forget
the
shock
with
which
she
heard
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
relating
to
old
Monsieur
Farival
the
harrowing
story
of
one
*NL*
of
her
accouchements
,
withholding
no
intimate
detail
.
She
was
growing
*NL*
accustomed
to
like
shocks
,
but
she
could
not
keep
the
mounting
color
*NL*
back
from
her
cheeks
.
Oftener
than
once
her
coming
had
interrupted
the
*NL*
droll
story
with
which
Robert
was
entertaining
some
amused
group
of
*NL*
married
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
book
had
gone
the
rounds
of
the
pension
.
When
it
came
her
turn
to
read
*NL*
it
,
she
did
so
with
profound
astonishment
.
She
felt
moved
to
read
the
*NL*
book
in
secret
and
solitude
,
though
none
of
the
others
had
done
so
,
--
to
*NL*
hide
it
from
view
at
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
.
It
was
openly
*NL*
criticised
and
freely
discussed
at
table
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
gave
over
*NL*
being
astonished
,
and
concluded
that
wonders
would
never
cease
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
formed
a
congenial
group
sitting
there
that
summer
*NL*
afternoon
--
Madame
Ratignolle
sewing
away
,
often
stopping
to
relate
a
*NL*
story
or
incident
with
much
expressive
gesture
of
her
perfect
hands
;
*NL*
Robert
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
sitting
idle
,
exchanging
occasional
words
,
*NL*
glances
or
smiles
which
indicated
a
certain
advanced
stage
of
intimacy
*NL*
and
camaraderie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
lived
in
her
shadow
during
the
past
month
.
No
one
thought
*NL*
anything
of
it
.
Many
had
predicted
that
Robert
would
devote
himself
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
when
he
arrived
.
Since
the
age
of
fifteen
,
which
was
*NL*
eleven
years
before
,
Robert
each
summer
at
Grand
Isle
had
constituted
*NL*
himself
the
devoted
attendant
of
some
fair
dame
or
damsel
.
Sometimes
*NL*
it
was
a
young
girl
,
again
a
widow
;
but
as
often
as
not
it
was
some
*NL*
interesting
married
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
consecutive
seasons
he
lived
in
the
sunlight
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Duvigne
's
presence
.
But
she
died
between
summers
;
then
Robert
posed
as
*NL*
an
inconsolable
,
prostrating
himself
at
the
feet
of
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
for
whatever
crumbs
of
sympathy
and
comfort
she
might
be
pleased
to
*NL*
vouchsafe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
liked
to
sit
and
gaze
at
her
fair
companion
as
she
might
*NL*
look
upon
a
faultless
Madonna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
any
one
fathom
the
cruelty
beneath
that
fair
exterior
?
''
murmured
*NL*
Robert
.
``
She
knew
that
I
adored
her
once
,
and
she
let
me
adore
her
.
It
*NL*
was
`
Robert
,
come
;
go
;
stand
up
;
sit
down
;
do
this
;
do
that
;
see
if
the
*NL*
baby
sleeps
;
my
thimble
,
please
,
that
I
left
God
knows
where
.
Come
and
*NL*
read
Daudet
to
me
while
I
sew
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Par
exemple
!
I
never
had
to
ask
.
You
were
always
there
under
my
feet
,
*NL*
like
a
troublesome
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
like
an
adoring
dog
.
And
just
as
soon
as
Ratignolle
appeared
*NL*
on
the
scene
,
then
it
WAS
like
a
dog
.
`
Passez
!
Adieu
!
Allez
vous-en
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
feared
to
make
Alphonse
jealous
,
''
she
interjoined
,
with
*NL*
excessive
naivete
.
That
made
them
all
laugh
.
The
right
hand
jealous
of
*NL*
the
left
!
The
heart
jealous
of
the
soul
!
But
for
that
matter
,
the
Creole
*NL*
husband
is
never
jealous
;
with
him
the
gangrene
passion
is
one
which
has
*NL*
become
dwarfed
by
disuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Robert
,
addressing
Mrs
Pontellier
,
continued
to
tell
of
his
*NL*
one
time
hopeless
passion
for
Madame
Ratignolle
;
of
sleepless
nights
,
*NL*
of
consuming
flames
till
the
very
sea
sizzled
when
he
took
his
*NL*
daily
plunge
.
While
the
lady
at
the
needle
kept
up
a
little
running
,
*NL*
contemptuous
comment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blagueur
--
farceur
--
gros
bete
,
va
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
assumed
this
seriocomic
tone
when
alone
with
Mrs.
Pontellier
.
*NL*
She
never
knew
precisely
what
to
make
of
it
;
at
that
moment
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
her
to
guess
how
much
of
it
was
jest
and
what
proportion
*NL*
was
earnest
.
It
was
understood
that
he
had
often
spoken
words
of
love
*NL*
to
Madame
Ratignolle
,
without
any
thought
of
being
taken
seriously
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
was
glad
he
had
not
assumed
a
similar
role
toward
herself
.
It
*NL*
would
have
been
unacceptable
and
annoying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
had
brought
her
sketching
materials
,
which
she
sometimes
*NL*
dabbled
with
in
an
unprofessional
way
.
She
liked
the
dabbling
.
She
felt
*NL*
in
it
satisfaction
of
a
kind
which
no
other
employment
afforded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
long
wished
to
try
herself
on
Madame
Ratignolle
.
Never
had
that
*NL*
lady
seemed
a
more
tempting
subject
than
at
that
moment
,
seated
there
*NL*
like
some
sensuous
Madonna
,
with
the
gleam
of
the
fading
day
enriching
*NL*
her
splendid
color
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
crossed
over
and
seated
himself
upon
the
step
below
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
,
that
he
might
watch
her
work
.
She
handled
her
brushes
with
*NL*
a
certain
ease
and
freedom
which
came
,
not
from
long
and
close
*NL*
acquaintance
with
them
,
but
from
a
natural
aptitude
.
Robert
followed
her
*NL*
work
with
close
attention
,
giving
forth
little
ejaculatory
expressions
*NL*
of
appreciation
in
French
,
which
he
addressed
to
Madame
Ratignolle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mais
ce
n'est
pas
mal
!
Elle
s
'
y
connait
,
elle
a
de
la
force
,
oui
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
oblivious
attention
he
once
quietly
rested
his
head
against
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
arm
.
As
gently
she
repulsed
him
.
Once
again
he
*NL*
repeated
the
offense
.
She
could
not
but
believe
it
to
be
thoughtlessness
*NL*
on
his
part
;
yet
that
was
no
reason
she
should
submit
to
it
.
She
did
not
*NL*
remonstrate
,
except
again
to
repulse
him
quietly
but
firmly
.
He
*NL*
offered
no
apology
.
The
picture
completed
bore
no
resemblance
to
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
.
She
was
greatly
disappointed
to
find
that
it
did
not
look
*NL*
like
her
.
But
it
was
a
fair
enough
piece
of
work
,
and
in
many
respects
*NL*
satisfying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
evidently
did
not
think
so
.
After
surveying
the
sketch
*NL*
critically
she
drew
a
broad
smudge
of
paint
across
its
surface
,
and
*NL*
crumpled
the
paper
between
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youngsters
came
tumbling
up
the
steps
,
the
quadroon
following
at
the
*NL*
respectful
distance
which
they
required
her
to
observe
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
*NL*
made
them
carry
her
paints
and
things
into
the
house
.
She
sought
to
*NL*
detain
them
for
a
little
talk
and
some
pleasantry
.
But
they
were
greatly
*NL*
in
earnest
.
They
had
only
come
to
investigate
the
contents
of
the
bonbon
*NL*
box
.
They
accepted
without
murmuring
what
she
chose
to
give
them
,
each
*NL*
holding
out
two
chubby
hands
scoop-like
,
in
the
vain
hope
that
they
*NL*
might
be
filled
;
and
then
away
they
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
low
in
the
west
,
and
the
breeze
soft
and
languorous
that
*NL*
came
up
from
the
south
,
charged
with
the
seductive
odor
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Children
freshly
befurbelowed
,
were
gathering
for
their
games
under
the
*NL*
oaks
.
Their
voices
were
high
and
penetrating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
folded
her
sewing
,
placing
thimble
,
scissors
,
and
*NL*
thread
all
neatly
together
in
the
roll
,
which
she
pinned
securely
.
She
*NL*
complained
of
faintness
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
flew
for
the
cologne
water
and
*NL*
a
fan
.
She
bathed
Madame
Ratignolle
's
face
with
cologne
,
while
Robert
*NL*
plied
the
fan
with
unnecessary
vigor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spell
was
soon
over
,
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
could
not
help
wondering
if
*NL*
there
were
not
a
little
imagination
responsible
for
its
origin
,
for
the
*NL*
rose
tint
had
never
faded
from
her
friend
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
watching
the
fair
woman
walk
down
the
long
line
of
galleries
*NL*
with
the
grace
and
majesty
which
queens
are
sometimes
supposed
to
*NL*
possess
.
Her
little
ones
ran
to
meet
her
.
Two
of
them
clung
about
her
*NL*
white
skirts
,
the
third
she
took
from
its
nurse
and
with
a
thousand
*NL*
endearments
bore
it
along
in
her
own
fond
,
encircling
arms
.
Though
,
as
*NL*
everybody
well
knew
,
the
doctor
had
forbidden
her
to
lift
so
much
as
a
*NL*
pin
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
bathing
?
''
asked
Robert
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
.
It
was
not
so
*NL*
much
a
question
as
a
reminder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
answered
,
with
a
tone
of
indecision
.
``
I
'm
tired
;
I
think
*NL*
not
.
''
Her
glance
wandered
from
his
face
away
toward
the
Gulf
,
whose
*NL*
sonorous
murmur
reached
her
like
a
loving
but
imperative
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
!
''
he
insisted
.
``
You
must
n't
miss
your
bath
.
Come
on
.
The
water
*NL*
must
be
delicious
;
it
will
not
hurt
you
.
Come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
up
for
her
big
,
rough
straw
hat
that
hung
on
a
peg
outside
*NL*
the
door
,
and
put
it
on
her
head
.
They
descended
the
steps
,
and
walked
*NL*
away
together
toward
the
beach
.
The
sun
was
low
in
the
west
and
the
*NL*
breeze
was
soft
and
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
Pontellier
could
not
have
told
why
,
wishing
to
go
to
the
beach
with
*NL*
Robert
,
she
should
in
the
first
place
have
declined
,
and
in
the
second
*NL*
place
have
followed
in
obedience
to
one
of
the
two
contradictory
*NL*
impulses
which
impelled
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
light
was
beginning
to
dawn
dimly
within
her
,
--
the
light
*NL*
which
,
showing
the
way
,
forbids
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
early
period
it
served
but
to
bewilder
her
.
It
moved
her
to
*NL*
dreams
,
to
thoughtfulness
,
to
the
shadowy
anguish
which
had
overcome
her
*NL*
the
midnight
when
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
beginning
to
realize
her
position
in
*NL*
the
universe
as
a
human
being
,
and
to
recognize
her
relations
as
an
*NL*
individual
to
the
world
within
and
about
her
.
This
may
seem
like
a
*NL*
ponderous
weight
of
wisdom
to
descend
upon
the
soul
of
a
young
woman
of
*NL*
twenty-eight
--
perhaps
more
wisdom
than
the
Holy
Ghost
is
usually
pleased
*NL*
to
vouchsafe
to
any
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
beginning
of
things
,
of
a
world
especially
,
is
necessarily
*NL*
vague
,
tangled
,
chaotic
,
and
exceedingly
disturbing
.
How
few
of
us
ever
*NL*
emerge
from
such
beginning
!
How
many
souls
perish
in
its
tumult
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
sea
is
seductive
;
never
ceasing
,
whispering
,
clamoring
,
*NL*
murmuring
,
inviting
the
soul
to
wander
for
a
spell
in
abysses
of
*NL*
solitude
;
to
lose
itself
in
mazes
of
inward
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
sea
speaks
to
the
soul
.
The
touch
of
the
sea
is
*NL*
sensuous
,
enfolding
the
body
in
its
soft
,
close
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
was
not
a
woman
given
to
confidences
,
a
characteristic
*NL*
hitherto
contrary
to
her
nature
.
Even
as
a
child
she
had
lived
her
*NL*
own
small
life
all
within
herself
.
At
a
very
early
period
she
had
*NL*
apprehended
instinctively
the
dual
life
--
that
outward
existence
which
*NL*
conforms
,
the
inward
life
which
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
summer
at
Grand
Isle
she
began
to
loosen
a
little
the
mantle
of
*NL*
reserve
that
had
always
enveloped
her
.
There
may
have
been
--
there
*NL*
must
have
been
--
influences
,
both
subtle
and
apparent
,
working
in
their
*NL*
several
ways
to
induce
her
to
do
this
;
but
the
most
obvious
was
the
*NL*
influence
of
Adele
Ratignolle
.
The
excessive
physical
charm
of
the
*NL*
Creole
had
first
attracted
her
,
for
Edna
had
a
sensuous
susceptibility
*NL*
to
beauty
.
Then
the
candor
of
the
woman
's
whole
existence
,
which
every
*NL*
one
might
read
,
and
which
formed
so
striking
a
contrast
to
her
own
*NL*
habitual
reserve
--
this
might
have
furnished
a
link
.
Who
can
tell
what
*NL*
metals
the
gods
use
in
forging
the
subtle
bond
which
we
call
sympathy
,
*NL*
which
we
might
as
well
call
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
went
away
one
morning
to
the
beach
together
,
arm
in
arm
,
*NL*
under
the
huge
white
sunshade
.
Edna
had
prevailed
upon
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
to
leave
the
children
behind
,
though
she
could
not
induce
her
to
*NL*
relinquish
a
diminutive
roll
of
needlework
,
which
Adele
begged
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
slip
into
the
depths
of
her
pocket
.
In
some
unaccountable
way
*NL*
they
had
escaped
from
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walk
to
the
beach
was
no
inconsiderable
one
,
consisting
as
it
did
*NL*
of
a
long
,
sandy
path
,
upon
which
a
sporadic
and
tangled
growth
that
*NL*
bordered
it
on
either
side
made
frequent
and
unexpected
inroads
.
There
*NL*
were
acres
of
yellow
camomile
reaching
out
on
either
hand
.
Further
away
*NL*
still
,
vegetable
gardens
abounded
,
with
frequent
small
plantations
of
*NL*
orange
or
lemon
trees
intervening
.
The
dark
green
clusters
glistened
*NL*
from
afar
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
were
both
of
goodly
height
,
Madame
Ratignolle
possessing
*NL*
the
more
feminine
and
matronly
figure
.
The
charm
of
Edna
Pontellier
's
*NL*
physique
stole
insensibly
upon
you
.
The
lines
of
her
body
were
long
,
*NL*
clean
and
symmetrical
;
it
was
a
body
which
occasionally
fell
into
*NL*
splendid
poses
;
there
was
no
suggestion
of
the
trim
,
stereotyped
*NL*
fashion-plate
about
it
.
A
casual
and
indiscriminating
observer
,
in
*NL*
passing
,
might
not
cast
a
second
glance
upon
the
figure
.
But
with
more
*NL*
feeling
and
discernment
he
would
have
recognized
the
noble
beauty
of
its
*NL*
modeling
,
and
the
graceful
severity
of
poise
and
movement
,
which
made
*NL*
Edna
Pontellier
different
from
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wore
a
cool
muslin
that
morning
--
white
,
with
a
waving
vertical
line
*NL*
of
brown
running
through
it
;
also
a
white
linen
collar
and
the
big
straw
*NL*
hat
which
she
had
taken
from
the
peg
outside
the
door
.
The
hat
rested
*NL*
any
way
on
her
yellow-brown
hair
,
that
waved
a
little
,
was
heavy
,
and
*NL*
clung
close
to
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
,
more
careful
of
her
complexion
,
had
twined
a
gauze
*NL*
veil
about
her
head
.
She
wore
dogskin
gloves
,
with
gauntlets
that
*NL*
protected
her
wrists
.
She
was
dressed
in
pure
white
,
with
a
fluffiness
*NL*
of
ruffles
that
became
her
.
The
draperies
and
fluttering
things
which
*NL*
she
wore
suited
her
rich
,
luxuriant
beauty
as
a
greater
severity
of
line
*NL*
could
not
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
number
of
bath-houses
along
the
beach
,
of
rough
but
solid
*NL*
construction
,
built
with
small
,
protecting
galleries
facing
the
water
.
*NL*
Each
house
consisted
of
two
compartments
,
and
each
family
at
Lebrun
's
*NL*
possessed
a
compartment
for
itself
,
fitted
out
with
all
the
essential
*NL*
paraphernalia
of
the
bath
and
whatever
other
conveniences
the
owners
*NL*
might
desire
.
The
two
women
had
no
intention
of
bathing
;
they
had
just
*NL*
strolled
down
to
the
beach
for
a
walk
and
to
be
alone
and
near
the
*NL*
water
.
The
Pontellier
and
Ratignolle
compartments
adjoined
one
another
*NL*
under
the
same
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
had
brought
down
her
key
through
force
of
habit
.
*NL*
Unlocking
the
door
of
her
bath-room
she
went
inside
,
and
soon
emerged
,
*NL*
bringing
a
rug
,
which
she
spread
upon
the
floor
of
the
gallery
,
and
two
*NL*
huge
hair
pillows
covered
with
crash
,
which
she
placed
against
the
front
*NL*
of
the
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
seated
themselves
there
in
the
shade
of
the
porch
,
side
by
side
,
*NL*
with
their
backs
against
the
pillows
and
their
feet
extended
.
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
removed
her
veil
,
wiped
her
face
with
a
rather
delicate
*NL*
handkerchief
,
and
fanned
herself
with
the
fan
which
she
always
carried
*NL*
suspended
somewhere
about
her
person
by
a
long
,
narrow
ribbon
.
Edna
*NL*
removed
her
collar
and
opened
her
dress
at
the
throat
.
She
took
the
fan
*NL*
from
Madame
Ratignolle
and
began
to
fan
both
herself
and
her
companion
.
*NL*
It
was
very
warm
,
and
for
a
while
they
did
nothing
but
exchange
remarks
*NL*
about
the
heat
,
the
sun
,
the
glare
.
But
there
was
a
breeze
blowing
,
a
*NL*
choppy
,
stiff
wind
that
whipped
the
water
into
froth
.
It
fluttered
the
*NL*
skirts
of
the
two
women
and
kept
them
for
a
while
engaged
in
adjusting
,
*NL*
readjusting
,
tucking
in
,
securing
hair-pins
and
hat-pins
.
A
few
persons
*NL*
were
sporting
some
distance
away
in
the
water
.
The
beach
was
very
still
*NL*
of
human
sound
at
that
hour
.
The
lady
in
black
was
reading
her
morning
*NL*
devotions
on
the
porch
of
a
neighboring
bathhouse
.
Two
young
lovers
were
*NL*
exchanging
their
hearts
'
yearnings
beneath
the
children
's
tent
,
which
*NL*
they
had
found
unoccupied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
Pontellier
,
casting
her
eyes
about
,
had
finally
kept
them
at
rest
*NL*
upon
the
sea
.
The
day
was
clear
and
carried
the
gaze
out
as
far
as
the
*NL*
blue
sky
went
;
there
were
a
few
white
clouds
suspended
idly
over
the
*NL*
horizon
.
A
lateen
sail
was
visible
in
the
direction
of
Cat
Island
,
and
*NL*
others
to
the
south
seemed
almost
motionless
in
the
far
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
whom
--
of
what
are
you
thinking
?
''
asked
Adele
of
her
companion
,
*NL*
whose
countenance
she
had
been
watching
with
a
little
amused
attention
,
*NL*
arrested
by
the
absorbed
expression
which
seemed
to
have
seized
and
*NL*
fixed
every
feature
into
a
statuesque
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
returned
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
with
a
start
,
adding
at
once
:
``
How
*NL*
stupid
!
But
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
reply
we
make
instinctively
to
*NL*
such
a
question
.
Let
me
see
,
''
she
went
on
,
throwing
back
her
head
and
*NL*
narrowing
her
fine
eyes
till
they
shone
like
two
vivid
points
of
light
.
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
.
I
was
really
not
conscious
of
thinking
of
anything
;
but
*NL*
perhaps
I
can
retrace
my
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
never
mind
!
''
laughed
Madame
Ratignolle
.
``
I
am
not
quite
so
*NL*
exacting
.
I
will
let
you
off
this
time
.
It
is
really
too
hot
to
think
,
*NL*
especially
to
think
about
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
for
the
fun
of
it
,
''
persisted
Edna
.
``
First
of
all
,
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
water
stretching
so
far
away
,
those
motionless
sails
against
the
blue
*NL*
sky
,
made
a
delicious
picture
that
I
just
wanted
to
sit
and
look
at
.
The
*NL*
hot
wind
beating
in
my
face
made
me
think
--
without
any
connection
that
I
*NL*
can
trace
of
a
summer
day
in
Kentucky
,
of
a
meadow
that
seemed
as
big
as
*NL*
the
ocean
to
the
very
little
girl
walking
through
the
grass
,
which
was
*NL*
higher
than
her
waist
.
She
threw
out
her
arms
as
if
swimming
when
she
*NL*
walked
,
beating
the
tall
grass
as
one
strikes
out
in
the
water
.
Oh
,
I
*NL*
see
the
connection
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
going
that
day
in
Kentucky
,
walking
through
the
grass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
now
.
I
was
just
walking
diagonally
across
a
big
field
.
*NL*
My
sun-bonnet
obstructed
the
view
.
I
could
see
only
the
stretch
of
green
*NL*
before
me
,
and
I
felt
as
if
I
must
walk
on
forever
,
without
coming
to
*NL*
the
end
of
it
.
I
do
n't
remember
whether
I
was
frightened
or
pleased
.
I
*NL*
must
have
been
entertained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Likely
as
not
it
was
Sunday
,
''
she
laughed
;
``
and
I
was
running
away
from
*NL*
prayers
,
from
the
Presbyterian
service
,
read
in
a
spirit
of
gloom
by
my
*NL*
father
that
chills
me
yet
to
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
been
running
away
from
prayers
ever
since
,
ma
chere
?
''
*NL*
asked
Madame
Ratignolle
,
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
oh
,
no
!
''
Edna
hastened
to
say
.
``
I
was
a
little
unthinking
child
in
*NL*
those
days
,
just
following
a
misleading
impulse
without
question
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
during
one
period
of
my
life
religion
took
a
firm
hold
upon
*NL*
me
;
after
I
was
twelve
and
until-until
--
why
,
I
suppose
until
now
,
though
*NL*
I
never
thought
much
about
it
--
just
driven
along
by
habit
.
But
do
you
*NL*
know
,
''
she
broke
off
,
turning
her
quick
eyes
upon
Madame
Ratignolle
and
*NL*
leaning
forward
a
little
so
as
to
bring
her
face
quite
close
to
that
*NL*
of
her
companion
,
``
sometimes
I
feel
this
summer
as
if
I
were
walking
*NL*
through
the
green
meadow
again
;
idly
,
aimlessly
,
unthinking
and
*NL*
unguided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
laid
her
hand
over
that
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
which
was
*NL*
near
her
.
Seeing
that
the
hand
was
not
withdrawn
,
she
clasped
it
firmly
*NL*
and
warmly
.
She
even
stroked
it
a
little
,
fondly
,
with
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
murmuring
in
an
undertone
,
``
Pauvre
cherie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
action
was
at
first
a
little
confusing
to
Edna
,
but
she
soon
lent
*NL*
herself
readily
to
the
Creole
's
gentle
caress
.
She
was
not
accustomed
to
*NL*
an
outward
and
spoken
expression
of
affection
,
either
in
herself
or
in
*NL*
others
.
She
and
her
younger
sister
,
Janet
,
had
quarreled
a
good
deal
*NL*
through
force
of
unfortunate
habit
.
Her
older
sister
,
Margaret
,
was
*NL*
matronly
and
dignified
,
probably
from
having
assumed
matronly
and
*NL*
housewifely
responsibilities
too
early
in
life
,
their
mother
having
*NL*
died
when
they
were
quite
young
,
Margaret
was
not
effusive
;
she
*NL*
was
practical
.
Edna
had
had
an
occasional
girl
friend
,
but
whether
*NL*
accidentally
or
not
,
they
seemed
to
have
been
all
of
one
type
--
the
*NL*
self-contained
.
She
never
realized
that
the
reserve
of
her
own
character
*NL*
had
much
,
perhaps
everything
,
to
do
with
this
.
Her
most
intimate
friend
*NL*
at
school
had
been
one
of
rather
exceptional
intellectual
gifts
,
who
*NL*
wrote
fine-sounding
essays
,
which
Edna
admired
and
strove
to
imitate
;
*NL*
and
with
her
she
talked
and
glowed
over
the
English
classics
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
held
religious
and
political
controversies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
often
wondered
at
one
propensity
which
sometimes
had
inwardly
*NL*
disturbed
her
without
causing
any
outward
show
or
manifestation
on
her
*NL*
part
.
At
a
very
early
age
--
perhaps
it
was
when
she
traversed
the
ocean
*NL*
of
waving
grass
--
she
remembered
that
she
had
been
passionately
enamored
*NL*
of
a
dignified
and
sad-eyed
cavalry
officer
who
visited
her
father
in
*NL*
Kentucky
.
She
could
not
leave
his
presence
when
he
was
there
,
nor
remove
*NL*
her
eyes
from
his
face
,
which
was
something
like
Napoleon
's
,
with
a
*NL*
lock
of
black
hair
failing
across
the
forehead
.
But
the
cavalry
officer
*NL*
melted
imperceptibly
out
of
her
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
her
affections
were
deeply
engaged
by
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
who
visited
a
lady
on
a
neighboring
plantation
.
It
was
after
they
went
*NL*
to
Mississippi
to
live
.
The
young
man
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
and
they
sometimes
called
upon
Margaret
,
driving
over
of
*NL*
afternoons
in
a
buggy
.
Edna
was
a
little
miss
,
just
merging
into
her
*NL*
teens
;
and
the
realization
that
she
herself
was
nothing
,
nothing
,
*NL*
nothing
to
the
engaged
young
man
was
a
bitter
affliction
to
her
.
But
he
,
*NL*
too
,
went
the
way
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
grown
young
woman
when
she
was
overtaken
by
what
she
supposed
*NL*
to
be
the
climax
of
her
fate
.
It
was
when
the
face
and
figure
of
a
*NL*
great
tragedian
began
to
haunt
her
imagination
and
stir
her
senses
.
The
*NL*
persistence
of
the
infatuation
lent
it
an
aspect
of
genuineness
.
The
*NL*
hopelessness
of
it
colored
it
with
the
lofty
tones
of
a
great
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture
of
the
tragedian
stood
enframed
upon
her
desk
.
Any
one
*NL*
may
possess
the
portrait
of
a
tragedian
without
exciting
suspicion
or
*NL*
comment
.
-LRB-
This
was
a
sinister
reflection
which
she
cherished
.
-RRB-
In
the
*NL*
presence
of
others
she
expressed
admiration
for
his
exalted
gifts
,
as
*NL*
she
handed
the
photograph
around
and
dwelt
upon
the
fidelity
of
the
*NL*
likeness
.
When
alone
she
sometimes
picked
it
up
and
kissed
the
cold
*NL*
glass
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
marriage
to
Leonce
Pontellier
was
purely
an
accident
,
in
this
*NL*
respect
resembling
many
other
marriages
which
masquerade
as
the
decrees
*NL*
of
Fate
.
It
was
in
the
midst
of
her
secret
great
passion
that
she
met
*NL*
him
.
He
fell
in
love
,
as
men
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
,
and
pressed
his
*NL*
suit
with
an
earnestness
and
an
ardor
which
left
nothing
to
be
desired
.
*NL*
He
pleased
her
;
his
absolute
devotion
flattered
her
.
She
fancied
there
*NL*
was
a
sympathy
of
thought
and
taste
between
them
,
in
which
fancy
she
*NL*
was
mistaken
.
Add
to
this
the
violent
opposition
of
her
father
and
her
*NL*
sister
Margaret
to
her
marriage
with
a
Catholic
,
and
we
need
seek
no
*NL*
further
for
the
motives
which
led
her
to
accept
Monsieur
Pontellier
for
*NL*
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
acme
of
bliss
,
which
would
have
been
a
marriage
with
the
tragedian
,
*NL*
was
not
for
her
in
this
world
.
As
the
devoted
wife
of
a
man
who
*NL*
worshiped
her
,
she
felt
she
would
take
her
place
with
a
certain
dignity
*NL*
in
the
world
of
reality
,
closing
the
portals
forever
behind
her
upon
the
*NL*
realm
of
romance
and
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
long
before
the
tragedian
had
gone
to
join
the
cavalry
*NL*
officer
and
the
engaged
young
man
and
a
few
others
;
and
Edna
found
*NL*
herself
face
to
face
with
the
realities
.
She
grew
fond
of
her
husband
,
*NL*
realizing
with
some
unaccountable
satisfaction
that
no
trace
of
passion
*NL*
or
excessive
and
fictitious
warmth
colored
her
affection
,
thereby
*NL*
threatening
its
dissolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fond
of
her
children
in
an
uneven
,
impulsive
way
.
She
would
*NL*
sometimes
gather
them
passionately
to
her
heart
;
she
would
sometimes
*NL*
forget
them
.
The
year
before
they
had
spent
part
of
the
summer
with
*NL*
their
grandmother
Pontellier
in
Iberville
.
Feeling
secure
regarding
*NL*
their
happiness
and
welfare
,
she
did
not
miss
them
except
with
an
*NL*
occasional
intense
longing
.
Their
absence
was
a
sort
of
relief
,
though
*NL*
she
did
not
admit
this
,
even
to
herself
.
It
seemed
to
free
her
of
a
*NL*
responsibility
which
she
had
blindly
assumed
and
for
which
Fate
had
not
*NL*
fitted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
did
not
reveal
so
much
as
all
this
to
Madame
Ratignolle
that
summer
*NL*
day
when
they
sat
with
faces
turned
to
the
sea
.
But
a
good
part
of
it
*NL*
escaped
her
.
She
had
put
her
head
down
on
Madame
Ratignolle
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
She
was
flushed
and
felt
intoxicated
with
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
and
*NL*
the
unaccustomed
taste
of
candor
.
It
muddled
her
like
wine
,
or
like
a
*NL*
first
breath
of
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
sound
of
approaching
voices
.
It
was
Robert
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
a
troop
of
children
,
searching
for
them
.
The
two
little
Pontelliers
were
*NL*
with
him
,
and
he
carried
Madame
Ratignolle
's
little
girl
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
There
were
other
children
beside
,
and
two
nurse-maids
followed
,
looking
*NL*
disagreeable
and
resigned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
at
once
rose
and
began
to
shake
out
their
draperies
and
relax
*NL*
their
muscles
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
threw
the
cushions
and
rug
into
the
*NL*
bath-house
.
The
children
all
scampered
off
to
the
awning
,
and
they
stood
*NL*
there
in
a
line
,
gazing
upon
the
intruding
lovers
,
still
exchanging
*NL*
their
vows
and
sighs
.
The
lovers
got
up
,
with
only
a
silent
protest
,
and
*NL*
walked
slowly
away
somewhere
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
possessed
themselves
of
the
tent
,
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
went
*NL*
over
to
join
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
begged
Robert
to
accompany
her
to
the
house
;
she
*NL*
complained
of
cramp
in
her
limbs
and
stiffness
of
the
joints
.
She
leaned
*NL*
draggingly
upon
his
arm
as
they
walked
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
me
a
favor
,
Robert
,
''
spoke
the
pretty
woman
at
his
side
,
almost
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
and
Robert
had
started
their
slow
,
homeward
way
.
She
looked
*NL*
up
in
his
face
,
leaning
on
his
arm
beneath
the
encircling
shadow
of
the
*NL*
umbrella
which
he
had
lifted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granted
;
as
many
as
you
like
,
''
he
returned
,
glancing
down
into
her
eyes
*NL*
that
were
full
of
thoughtfulness
and
some
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
ask
for
one
;
let
Mrs.
Pontellier
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tiens
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
sudden
,
boyish
laugh
.
``
Voila

Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle

jalouse

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

I
'm
in
earnest

mean
what
I
say

Let
Mrs.
Pontellier
*NL*
alone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
asked
;
himself
growing
serious
at
his
companion
's
*NL*
solicitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
not
one
of
us
;
she
is
not
like
us
.
She
might
make
the
*NL*
unfortunate
blunder
of
taking
you
seriously
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
flushed
with
annoyance
,
and
taking
off
his
soft
hat
he
began
*NL*
to
beat
it
impatiently
against
his
leg
as
he
walked
.
``
Why
should
n't
she
*NL*
take
me
seriously
?

he
demanded
sharply
.
``
Am
I
a
comedian

a
clown

jack-in-the-box

Why
should
n't
she

You
Creoles

I
have
no
patience
with
*NL*
you

Am
I
always
to
be
regarded
as
a
feature
of
an
amusing
programme
?
I
*NL*
hope
Mrs.
Pontellier
does
take
me
seriously
.
I
hope
she
has
discernment
*NL*
enough
to
find
in
me
something
besides
the
blagueur

If
I
thought
there
*NL*
was
any
doubt
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
enough
,
Robert
!
''
she
broke
into
his
heated
outburst
.
``
You
are
*NL*
not
thinking
of
what
you
are
saying
.
You
speak
with
about
as
little
*NL*
reflection
as
we
might
expect
from
one
of
those
children
down
there
*NL*
playing
in
the
sand
.
If
your
attentions
to
any
married
women
here
were
*NL*
ever
offered
with
any
intention
of
being
convincing
,
you
would
not
be
*NL*
the
gentleman
we
all
know
you
to
be
,
and
you
would
be
unfit
to
associate
*NL*
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
the
people
who
trust
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
had
spoken
what
she
believed
to
be
the
law
and
the
*NL*
gospel
.
The
young
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
well
!
That
is
n't
it
,
''
slamming
his
hat
down
vehemently
upon
his
*NL*
head
.
``
You
ought
to
feel
that
such
things
are
not
flattering
to
say
to
a
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
our
whole
intercourse
consist
of
an
exchange
of
compliments
?
Ma
*NL*
foi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
pleasant
to
have
a
woman
tell
you
--
''
he
went
on
,
unheedingly
,
*NL*
but
breaking
off
suddenly
:
``
Now
if
I
were
like
Arobin-you
remember
Alcee
*NL*
Arobin
and
that
story
of
the
consul
's
wife
at
Biloxi
?
''
And
he
related
*NL*
the
story
of
Alcee
Arobin
and
the
consul
's
wife
;
and
another
about
the
*NL*
tenor
of
the
French
Opera
,
who
received
letters
which
should
never
*NL*
have
been
written
;
and
still
other
stories
,
grave
and
gay
,
till
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
and
her
possible
propensity
for
taking
young
men
seriously
*NL*
was
apparently
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
,
when
they
had
regained
her
cottage
,
went
in
to
take
*NL*
the
hour
's
rest
which
she
considered
helpful
.
Before
leaving
her
,
Robert
*NL*
begged
her
pardon
for
the
impatience
--
he
called
it
rudeness
--
with
which
*NL*
he
had
received
her
well-meant
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
made
one
mistake
,
Adele
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
light
smile
;
``
there
is
*NL*
no
earthly
possibility
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
ever
taking
me
seriously
.
You
*NL*
should
have
warned
me
against
taking
myself
seriously
.
Your
advice
might
*NL*
then
have
carried
some
weight
and
given
me
subject
for
some
reflection
.
*NL*
Au
revoir
.
But
you
look
tired
,
''
he
added
,
solicitously
.
``
Would
you
like
*NL*
a
cup
of
bouillon
?
Shall
I
stir
you
a
toddy
?
Let
me
mix
you
a
toddy
with
*NL*
a
drop
of
Angostura
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
acceded
to
the
suggestion
of
bouillon
,
which
was
grateful
and
*NL*
acceptable
.
He
went
himself
to
the
kitchen
,
which
was
a
building
apart
*NL*
from
the
cottages
and
lying
to
the
rear
of
the
house
.
And
he
himself
*NL*
brought
her
the
golden-brown
bouillon
,
in
a
dainty
Sevres
cup
,
with
a
*NL*
flaky
cracker
or
two
on
the
saucer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thrust
a
bare
,
white
arm
from
the
curtain
which
shielded
her
open
*NL*
door
,
and
received
the
cup
from
his
hands
.
She
told
him
he
was
a
bon
*NL*
garcon
,
and
she
meant
it
.
Robert
thanked
her
and
turned
away
toward
``
the
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
were
just
entering
the
grounds
of
the
pension
.
They
were
*NL*
leaning
toward
each
other
as
the
wateroaks
bent
from
the
sea
.
There
was
*NL*
not
a
particle
of
earth
beneath
their
feet
.
Their
heads
might
have
been
*NL*
turned
upside-down
,
so
absolutely
did
they
tread
upon
blue
ether
.
The
*NL*
lady
in
black
,
creeping
behind
them
,
looked
a
trifle
paler
and
more
*NL*
jaded
than
usual
.
There
was
no
sign
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
and
the
children
.
*NL*
Robert
scanned
the
distance
for
any
such
apparition
.
They
would
*NL*
doubtless
remain
away
till
the
dinner
hour
.
The
young
man
ascended
to
*NL*
his
mother
's
room
.
It
was
situated
at
the
top
of
the
house
,
made
up
of
*NL*
odd
angles
and
a
queer
,
sloping
ceiling
.
Two
broad
dormer
windows
looked
*NL*
out
toward
the
Gulf
,
and
as
far
across
it
as
a
man
's
eye
might
reach
.
*NL*
The
furnishings
of
the
room
were
light
,
cool
,
and
practical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
was
busily
engaged
at
the
sewing-machine
.
A
little
black
*NL*
girl
sat
on
the
floor
,
and
with
her
hands
worked
the
treadle
of
the
*NL*
machine
.
The
Creole
woman
does
not
take
any
chances
which
may
be
avoided
*NL*
of
imperiling
her
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
went
over
and
seated
himself
on
the
broad
sill
of
one
of
the
*NL*
dormer
windows
.
He
took
a
book
from
his
pocket
and
began
energetically
*NL*
to
read
it
,
judging
by
the
precision
and
frequency
with
which
he
turned
*NL*
the
leaves
.
The
sewing-machine
made
a
resounding
clatter
in
the
room
;
*NL*
it
was
of
a
ponderous
,
by-gone
make
.
In
the
lulls
,
Robert
and
his
mother
*NL*
exchanged
bits
of
desultory
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Mrs.
Pontellier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
at
the
beach
with

children

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Call

Clatter

*NL*
*NL*
Robert
uttered
a
shrill
,
piercing
whistle
which
might
have
been
heard
*NL*
back
at
the
wharf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
look
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
flew
to
the
window
.
She
called
``
Victor
!
''
She
waved
a
*NL*
handkerchief
and
called
again
.
The
young
fellow
below
got
into
the
*NL*
vehicle
and
started
the
horse
off
at
a
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
went
back
to
the
machine
,
crimson
with
annoyance
.
Victor
*NL*
was
the
younger
son
and
brother
--
a
tete
montee
,
with
a
temper
which
*NL*
invited
violence
and
a
will
which
no
ax
could
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
you
say
the
word
I
'm
ready
to
thrash
any
amount
of

him

able
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
father
had
only
lived
!
''
Clatter
,
clatter
,
clatter
,
clatter
,
*NL*
bang
!
It
was
a
fixed
belief
with
Madame
Lebrun
that
the
conduct
of
the
*NL*
universe
and
all
things
pertaining
thereto
would
have
been
manifestly
of
*NL*
a
more
intelligent
and
higher
order
had
not
Monsieur
Lebrun
been
removed
*NL*
to
other
spheres
during
the
early
years
of
their
married
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

Montel

''
Montel
was
a
middle-aged
gentleman
whose
*NL*
vain
ambition
and
desire
for
the
past
twenty
years
had
been
to
fill

Monsieur

taking
off

left
in

*NL*
Every
light
in
the
hall
was
ablaze
;
every
lamp
turned
as
high
as
it
*NL*
could
be
without
smoking
the
chimney
or
threatening
explosion
.
The
lamps
*NL*
were
fixed
at
intervals
against
the
wall
,
encircling
the
whole
room
.
*NL*
Some
one
had
gathered
orange
and
lemon
branches
,
and
with
these
*NL*
fashioned
graceful
festoons
between
.
The
dark
green
of
the
branches
*NL*
stood
out
and
glistened
against
the
white
muslin
curtains
which
draped
*NL*
the
windows
,
and
which
puffed
,
floated
,
and
flapped
at
the
capricious
*NL*
will
of
a
stiff
breeze
that
swept
up
from
the
Gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Saturday
night
a
few
weeks
after
the
intimate
conversation
held
*NL*
between
Robert
and
Madame
Ratignolle
on
their
way
from
the
beach
.
An
*NL*
unusual
number
of
husbands
,
fathers
,
and
friends
had
come
down
to
stay
*NL*
over
Sunday
;
and
they
were
being
suitably
entertained
by
their
families
,
*NL*
with
the
material
help
of
Madame
Lebrun
.
The
dining
tables
had
all
been
*NL*
removed
to
one
end
of
the
hall
,
and
the
chairs
ranged
about
in
rows
and
*NL*
in
clusters
.
Each
little
family
group
had
had
its
say
and
exchanged
*NL*
its
domestic
gossip
earlier
in
the
evening
.
There
was
now
an
apparent
*NL*
disposition
to
relax
;
to
widen
the
circle
of
confidences
and
give
a
more
*NL*
general
tone
to
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
the
children
had
been
permitted
to
sit
up
beyond
their
usual
*NL*
bedtime
.
A
small
band
of
them
were
lying
on
their
stomachs
on
the
floor
*NL*
looking
at
the
colored
sheets
of
the
comic
papers
which
Mr.
Pontellier
*NL*
had
brought
down
.
The
little
Pontellier
boys
were
permitting
them
to
do
*NL*
so
,
and
making
their
authority
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Music
,
dancing
,
and
a
recitation
or
two
were
the
entertainments
*NL*
furnished
,
or
rather
,
offered
.
But
there
was
nothing
systematic
about
*NL*
the
programme
,
no
appearance
of
prearrangement
nor
even
premeditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
an
early
hour
in
the
evening
the
Farival
twins
were
prevailed
upon
to
*NL*
play
the
piano
.
They
were
girls
of
fourteen
,
always
clad
in
the
Virgin
's
*NL*
colors
,
blue
and
white
,
having
been
dedicated
to
the
Blessed
Virgin
*NL*
at
their
baptism
.
They
played
a
duet
from
``
Zampa
,
''
and
at
the
earnest
*NL*
solicitation
of
every
one
present
followed
it
with
the
overture
to
``
The
*NL*
Poet
and
the
Peasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Allez
vous-en
!
Sapristi
!
''
shrieked
the
parrot
outside
the
door
.
He
was
*NL*
the
only
being
present
who
possessed
sufficient
candor
to
admit
that
he
*NL*
was
not
listening
to
these
gracious
performances
for
the
first
time
that
*NL*
summer
.
Old
Monsieur
Farival
,
grandfather
of
the
twins
,
grew
indignant
*NL*
over
the
interruption
,
and
insisted
upon
having
the
bird
removed
and
*NL*
consigned
to
regions
of
darkness
.
Victor
Lebrun
objected
;
and
his
*NL*
decrees
were
as
immutable
as
those
of
Fate
.
The
parrot
fortunately
*NL*
offered
no
further
interruption
to
the
entertainment
,
the
whole
venom
*NL*
of
his
nature
apparently
having
been
cherished
up
and
hurled
against
the
*NL*
twins
in
that
one
impetuous
outburst
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
a
young
brother
and
sister
gave
recitations
,
which
every
one
*NL*
present
had
heard
many
times
at
winter
evening
entertainments
in
the
*NL*
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
girl
performed
a
skirt
dance
in
the
center
of
the
floor
.
*NL*
The
mother
played
her
accompaniments
and
at
the
same
time
watched
her
*NL*
daughter
with
greedy
admiration
and
nervous
apprehension
.
She
need
have
*NL*
had
no
apprehension
.
The
child
was
mistress
of
the
situation
.
She
had
*NL*
been
properly
dressed
for
the
occasion
in
black
tulle
and
black
silk
*NL*
tights
.
Her
little
neck
and
arms
were
bare
,
and
her
hair
,
artificially
*NL*
crimped
,
stood
out
like
fluffy
black
plumes
over
her
head
.
Her
poses
*NL*
were
full
of
grace
,
and
her
little
black-shod
toes
twinkled
as
they
shot
*NL*
out
and
upward
with
a
rapidity
and
suddenness
which
were
bewildering
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
reason
why
every
one
should
not
dance
.
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
could
not
,
so
it
was
she
who
gaily
consented
to
play
for
the
*NL*
others
.
She
played
very
well
,
keeping
excellent
waltz
time
and
infusing
*NL*
an
expression
into
the
strains
which
was
indeed
inspiring
.
She
was
*NL*
keeping
up
her
music
on
account
of
the
children
,
she
said
;
because
she
*NL*
and
her
husband
both
considered
it
a
means
of
brightening
the
home
and
*NL*
making
it
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
every
one
danced
but
the
twins
,
who
could
not
be
induced
to
*NL*
separate
during
the
brief
period
when
one
or
the
other
should
be
*NL*
whirling
around
the
room
in
the
arms
of
a
man
.
They
might
have
danced
*NL*
together
,
but
they
did
not
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
were
sent
to
bed
.
Some
went
submissively
;
others
with
*NL*
shrieks
and
protests
as
they
were
dragged
away
.
They
had
been
permitted
*NL*
to
sit
up
till
after
the
ice-cream
,
which
naturally
marked
the
limit
of
*NL*
human
indulgence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice-cream
was
passed
around
with
cake
--
gold
and
silver
cake
arranged
*NL*
on
platters
in
alternate
slices
;
it
had
been
made
and
frozen
during
the
*NL*
afternoon
back
of
the
kitchen
by
two
black
women
,
under
the
supervision
*NL*
of
Victor
.
It
was
pronounced
a
great
success
--
excellent
if
it
had
only
*NL*
contained
a
little
less
vanilla
or
a
little
more
sugar
,
if
it
had
been
*NL*
frozen
a
degree
harder
,
and
if
the
salt
might
have
been
kept
out
of
*NL*
portions
of
it
.
Victor
was
proud
of
his
achievement
,
and
went
about
*NL*
recommending
it
and
urging
every
one
to
partake
of
it
to
excess
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Mrs.
Pontellier
had
danced
twice
with
her
husband
,
once
with
*NL*
Robert
,
and
once
with
Monsieur
Ratignolle
,
who
was
thin
and
tall
and
*NL*
swayed
like
a
reed
in
the
wind
when
he
danced
,
she
went
out
on
the
*NL*
gallery
and
seated
herself
on
the
low
window-sill
,
where
she
commanded
a
*NL*
view
of
all
that
went
on
in
the
hall
and
could
look
out
toward
the
Gulf
.
*NL*
There
was
a
soft
effulgence
in
the
east
.
The
moon
was
coming
up
,
and
its
*NL*
mystic
shimmer
was
casting
a
million
lights
across
the
distant
,
restless
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
hear
Mademoiselle
Reisz
play
?
''
asked
Robert
,
coming
*NL*
out
on
the
porch
where
she
was
.
Of
course
Edna
would
like
to
hear
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
play
;
but
she
feared
it
would
be
useless
to
entreat
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
her
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
tell
her
that
you
want
to
hear
her
.
She
*NL*
likes
you
.
She
will
come
.
''
He
turned
and
hurried
away
to
one
of
the
far
*NL*
cottages
,
where
Mademoiselle
Reisz
was
shuffling
away
.
She
was
dragging
*NL*
a
chair
in
and
out
of
her
room
,
and
at
intervals
objecting
to
the
crying
*NL*
of
a
baby
,
which
a
nurse
in
the
adjoining
cottage
was
endeavoring
to
put
*NL*
to
sleep
.
She
was
a
disagreeable
little
woman
,
no
longer
young
,
who
*NL*
had
quarreled
with
almost
every
one
,
owing
to
a
temper
which
was
*NL*
self-assertive
and
a
disposition
to
trample
upon
the
rights
of
others
.
*NL*
Robert
prevailed
upon
her
without
any
too
great
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
the
hall
with
him
during
a
lull
in
the
dance
.
She
made
an
*NL*
awkward
,
imperious
little
bow
as
she
went
in
.
She
was
a
homely
woman
,
*NL*
with
a
small
weazened
face
and
body
and
eyes
that
glowed
.
She
had
*NL*
absolutely
no
taste
in
dress
,
and
wore
a
batch
of
rusty
black
lace
with
*NL*
a
bunch
of
artificial
violets
pinned
to
the
side
of
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Mrs.
Pontellier
what
she
would
like
to
hear
me
play
,
''
she
requested
*NL*
of
Robert
.
She
sat
perfectly
still
before
the
piano
,
not
touching
the
*NL*
keys
,
while
Robert
carried
her
message
to
Edna
at
the
window
.
A
general
*NL*
air
of
surprise
and
genuine
satisfaction
fell
upon
every
one
as
they
saw
*NL*
the
pianist
enter
.
There
was
a
settling
down
,
and
a
prevailing
air
*NL*
of
expectancy
everywhere
.
Edna
was
a
trifle
embarrassed
at
being
thus
*NL*
signaled
out
for
the
imperious
little
woman
's
favor
.
She
would
not
dare
*NL*
to
choose
,
and
begged
that
Mademoiselle
Reisz
would
please
herself
in
*NL*
her
selections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
what
she
herself
called
very
fond
of
music
.
Musical
strains
,
*NL*
well
rendered
,
had
a
way
of
evoking
pictures
in
her
mind
.
She
sometimes
*NL*
liked
to
sit
in
the
room
of
mornings
when
Madame
Ratignolle
played
*NL*
or
practiced
.
One
piece
which
that
lady
played
Edna
had
entitled
*NL*
``
Solitude
.
''
It
was
a
short
,
plaintive
,
minor
strain
.
The
name
of
the
*NL*
piece
was
something
else
,
but
she
called
it
``
Solitude
.
''
When
she
heard
*NL*
it
there
came
before
her
imagination
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
beside
*NL*
a
desolate
rock
on
the
seashore
.
He
was
naked
.
His
attitude
was
one
*NL*
of
hopeless
resignation
as
he
looked
toward
a
distant
bird
winging
its
*NL*
flight
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
piece
called
to
her
mind
a
dainty
young
woman
clad
in
an
Empire
*NL*
gown
,
taking
mincing
dancing
steps
as
she
came
down
a
long
avenue
*NL*
between
tall
hedges
.
Again
,
another
reminded
her
of
children
at
play
,
*NL*
and
still
another
of
nothing
on
earth
but
a
demure
lady
stroking
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
first
chords
which
Mademoiselle
Reisz
struck
upon
the
piano
*NL*
sent
a
keen
tremor
down
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
spinal
column
.
It
was
not
*NL*
the
first
time
she
had
heard
an
artist
at
the
piano
.
Perhaps
it
was
the
*NL*
first
time
she
was
ready
,
perhaps
the
first
time
her
being
was
tempered
*NL*
to
take
an
impress
of
the
abiding
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
for
the
material
pictures
which
she
thought
would
gather
and
*NL*
blaze
before
her
imagination
.
She
waited
in
vain
.
She
saw
no
pictures
*NL*
of
solitude
,
of
hope
,
of
longing
,
or
of
despair
.
But
the
very
passions
*NL*
themselves
were
aroused
within
her
soul
,
swaying
it
,
lashing
it
,
as
the
*NL*
waves
daily
beat
upon
her
splendid
body
.
She
trembled
,
she
was
choking
,
*NL*
and
the
tears
blinded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
had
finished
.
She
arose
,
and
bowing
her
stiff
,
lofty
bow
,
*NL*
she
went
away
,
stopping
for
neither
thanks
nor
applause
.
As
she
passed
*NL*
along
the
gallery
she
patted
Edna
upon
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
did
you
like
my
music
?
''
she
asked
.
The
young
woman
was
*NL*
unable
to
answer
;
she
pressed
the
hand
of
the
pianist
convulsively
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
perceived
her
agitation
and
even
her
tears
.
She
*NL*
patted
her
again
upon
the
shoulder
as
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
only
one
worth
playing
for
.
Those
others
?
Bah
!
''
and
she
*NL*
went
shuffling
and
sidling
on
down
the
gallery
toward
her
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
mistaken
about
``
those
others
.
''
Her
playing
had
aroused
a
*NL*
fever
of
enthusiasm
.
``
What
passion
!
''
``
What
an
artist
!
''
``
I
have
always
*NL*
said
no
one
could
play
Chopin
like
Mademoiselle
Reisz
!
''
``
That
last
*NL*
prelude
!
Bon
Dieu
!
It
shakes
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
growing
late
,
and
there
was
a
general
disposition
to
disband
.
But
*NL*
some
one
,
perhaps
it
was
Robert
,
thought
of
a
bath
at
that
mystic
hour
*NL*
and
under
that
mystic
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
Robert
proposed
it
,
and
there
was
not
a
dissenting
voice
.
*NL*
There
was
not
one
but
was
ready
to
follow
when
he
led
the
way
.
He
did
*NL*
not
lead
the
way
,
however
,
he
directed
the
way
;
and
he
himself
loitered
*NL*
behind
with
the
lovers
,
who
had
betrayed
a
disposition
to
linger
and
*NL*
hold
themselves
apart
.
He
walked
between
them
,
whether
with
malicious
or
*NL*
mischievous
intent
was
not
wholly
clear
,
even
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pontelliers
and
Ratignolles
walked
ahead
;
the
women
leaning
upon
the
*NL*
arms
of
their
husbands
.
Edna
could
hear
Robert
's
voice
behind
them
,
*NL*
and
could
sometimes
hear
what
he
said
.
She
wondered
why
he
did
not
join
*NL*
them
.
It
was
unlike
him
not
to
.
Of
late
he
had
sometimes
held
away
from
*NL*
her
for
an
entire
day
,
redoubling
his
devotion
upon
the
next
and
the
*NL*
next
,
as
though
to
make
up
for
hours
that
had
been
lost
.
She
missed
him
*NL*
the
days
when
some
pretext
served
to
take
him
away
from
her
,
just
as
one
*NL*
misses
the
sun
on
a
cloudy
day
without
having
thought
much
about
the
sun
*NL*
when
it
was
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
walked
in
little
groups
toward
the
beach
.
They
talked
and
*NL*
laughed
;
some
of
them
sang
.
There
was
a
band
playing
down
at
Klein
's
*NL*
hotel
,
and
the
strains
reached
them
faintly
,
tempered
by
the
distance
.
*NL*
There
were
strange
,
rare
odors
abroad
--
a
tangle
of
the
sea
smell
and
of
*NL*
weeds
and
damp
,
new-plowed
earth
,
mingled
with
the
heavy
perfume
of
a
*NL*
field
of
white
blossoms
somewhere
near
.
But
the
night
sat
lightly
upon
*NL*
the
sea
and
the
land
.
There
was
no
weight
of
darkness
;
there
were
no
*NL*
shadows
.
The
white
light
of
the
moon
had
fallen
upon
the
world
like
the
*NL*
mystery
and
the
softness
of
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
them
walked
into
the
water
as
though
into
a
native
element
.
The
*NL*
sea
was
quiet
now
,
and
swelled
lazily
in
broad
billows
that
melted
into
*NL*
one
another
and
did
not
break
except
upon
the
beach
in
little
foamy
*NL*
crests
that
coiled
back
like
slow
,
white
serpents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
had
attempted
all
summer
to
learn
to
swim
.
She
had
received
*NL*
instructions
from
both
the
men
and
women
;
in
some
instances
from
the
*NL*
children
.
Robert
had
pursued
a
system
of
lessons
almost
daily
;
and
he
*NL*
was
nearly
at
the
point
of
discouragement
in
realizing
the
futility
of
*NL*
his
efforts
.
A
certain
ungovernable
dread
hung
about
her
when
in
the
*NL*
water
,
unless
there
was
a
hand
near
by
that
might
reach
out
and
reassure
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
night
she
was
like
the
little
tottering
,
stumbling
,
clutching
*NL*
child
,
who
of
a
sudden
realizes
its
powers
,
and
walks
for
the
first
time
*NL*
alone
,
boldly
and
with
over-confidence
.
She
could
have
shouted
for
joy
.
*NL*
She
did
shout
for
joy
,
as
with
a
sweeping
stroke
or
two
she
lifted
her
*NL*
body
to
the
surface
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
feeling
of
exultation
overtook
her
,
as
if
some
power
of
significant
*NL*
import
had
been
given
her
to
control
the
working
of
her
body
and
her
*NL*
soul
.
She
grew
daring
and
reckless
,
overestimating
her
strength
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
swim
far
out
,
where
no
woman
had
swum
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
unlooked-for
achievement
was
the
subject
of
wonder
,
applause
,
and
*NL*
admiration
.
Each
one
congratulated
himself
that
his
special
teachings
*NL*
had
accomplished
this
desired
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
easy
it
is
!
''
she
thought
.
``
It
is
nothing
,
''
she
said
aloud
;
``
why
did
*NL*
I
not
discover
before
that
it
was
nothing
.
Think
of
the
time
I
have
lost
*NL*
splashing
about
like
a
baby
!
''
She
would
not
join
the
groups
in
their
*NL*
sports
and
bouts
,
but
intoxicated
with
her
newly
conquered
power
,
she
*NL*
swam
out
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
seaward
to
gather
in
an
impression
of
space
and
*NL*
solitude
,
which
the
vast
expanse
of
water
,
meeting
and
melting
with
the
*NL*
moonlit
sky
,
conveyed
to
her
excited
fancy
.
As
she
swam
she
seemed
to
be
*NL*
reaching
out
for
the
unlimited
in
which
to
lose
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
turned
and
looked
toward
the
shore
,
toward
the
people
she
had
*NL*
left
there
.
She
had
not
gone
any
great
distance
--
that
is
,
what
would
*NL*
have
been
a
great
distance
for
an
experienced
swimmer
.
But
to
her
*NL*
unaccustomed
vision
the
stretch
of
water
behind
her
assumed
the
aspect
*NL*
of
a
barrier
which
her
unaided
strength
would
never
be
able
to
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
vision
of
death
smote
her
soul
,
and
for
a
second
of
time
*NL*
appalled
and
enfeebled
her
senses
.
But
by
an
effort
she
rallied
her
*NL*
staggering
faculties
and
managed
to
regain
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
mention
of
her
encounter
with
death
and
her
flash
of
terror
,
*NL*
except
to
say
to
her
husband
,
``
I
thought
I
should
have
perished
out
*NL*
there
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
so
very
far
,
my
dear
;
I
was
watching
you
,
''
he
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
went
at
once
to
the
bath-house
,
and
she
had
put
on
her
dry
clothes
*NL*
and
was
ready
to
return
home
before
the
others
had
left
the
water
.
She
*NL*
started
to
walk
away
alone
.
They
all
called
to
her
and
shouted
to
her
.
*NL*
She
waved
a
dissenting
hand
,
and
went
on
,
paying
no
further
heed
to
*NL*
their
renewed
cries
which
sought
to
detain
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
I
am
tempted
to
think
that
Mrs.
Pontellier
is
capricious
,
''
*NL*
said
Madame
Lebrun
,
who
was
amusing
herself
immensely
and
feared
that
*NL*
Edna
's
abrupt
departure
might
put
an
end
to
the
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
she
is
,
''
assented
Mr.
Pontellier
;
``
sometimes
,
not
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
had
not
traversed
a
quarter
of
the
distance
on
her
way
home
before
*NL*
she
was
overtaken
by
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
think
I
was
afraid
?
''
she
asked
him
,
without
a
shade
of
*NL*
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
knew
you
were
n't
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
come
?
Why
did
n't
you
stay
out
there
with
the
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thought
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
anything
.
What
difference
does
it
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
tired
,
''
she
uttered
,
complainingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
Why
should
you
know
?
I
never
was
so
*NL*
exhausted
in
my
life
.
But
it
is
n't
unpleasant
.
A
thousand
emotions
have
*NL*
swept
through
me
to-night
.
I
do
n't
comprehend
half
of
them
.
Do
n't
mind
*NL*
what
I
'm
saying
;
I
am
just
thinking
aloud
.
I
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
*NL*
be
stirred
again
as
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
playing
moved
me
to-night
.
I
*NL*
wonder
if
any
night
on
earth
will
ever
again
be
like
this
one
.
It
is
*NL*
like
a
night
in
a
dream
.
The
people
about
me
are
like
some
uncanny
,
*NL*
half-human
beings
.
There
must
be
spirits
abroad
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
,
''
whispered
Robert
,
``
Did
n't
you
know
this
was
the
*NL*
twenty-eighth
of
August
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
twenty-eighth
of
August
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
On
the
twenty-eighth
of
August
,
at
the
hour
of
midnight
,
and
if
*NL*
the
moon
is
shining
--
the
moon
must
be
shining
--
a
spirit
that
has
haunted
*NL*
these
shores
for
ages
rises
up
from
the
Gulf
.
With
its
own
penetrating
*NL*
vision
the
spirit
seeks
some
one
mortal
worthy
to
hold
him
*NL*
company
,
worthy
of
being
exalted
for
a
few
hours
into
realms
of
the
*NL*
semi-celestials
.
His
search
has
always
hitherto
been
fruitless
,
and
he
*NL*
has
sunk
back
,
disheartened
,
into
the
sea
.
But
to-night
he
found
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
.
Perhaps
he
will
never
wholly
release
her
from
the
spell
.
*NL*
Perhaps
she
will
never
again
suffer
a
poor
,
unworthy
earthling
to
walk
*NL*
in
the
shadow
of
her
divine
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
banter
me
,
''
she
said
,
wounded
at
what
appeared
to
be
his
*NL*
flippancy
.
He
did
not
mind
the
entreaty
,
but
the
tone
with
its
delicate
*NL*
note
of
pathos
was
like
a
reproach
.
He
could
not
explain
;
he
could
not
*NL*
tell
her
that
he
had
penetrated
her
mood
and
understood
.
He
said
*NL*
nothing
except
to
offer
her
his
arm
,
for
,
by
her
own
admission
,
she
*NL*
was
exhausted
.
She
had
been
walking
alone
with
her
arms
hanging
limp
,
*NL*
letting
her
white
skirts
trail
along
the
dewy
path
.
She
took
his
arm
,
*NL*
but
she
did
not
lean
upon
it
.
She
let
her
hand
lie
listlessly
,
as
though
*NL*
her
thoughts
were
elsewhere
--
somewhere
in
advance
of
her
body
,
and
she
*NL*
was
striving
to
overtake
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
assisted
her
into
the
hammock
which
swung
from
the
post
before
*NL*
her
door
out
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
stay
out
here
and
wait
for
Mr.
Pontellier
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
out
here
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
get
you
a
pillow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
here
,
''
she
said
,
feeling
about
,
for
they
were
in
the
*NL*
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
soiled
;
the
children
have
been
tumbling
it
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
matter
.
''
And
having
discovered
the
pillow
,
she
adjusted
it
beneath
*NL*
her
head
.
She
extended
herself
in
the
hammock
with
a
deep
breath
of
*NL*
relief
.
She
was
not
a
supercilious
or
an
over-dainty
woman
.
She
was
not
*NL*
much
given
to
reclining
in
the
hammock
,
and
when
she
did
so
it
was
with
*NL*
no
cat-like
suggestion
of
voluptuous
ease
,
but
with
a
beneficent
repose
*NL*
which
seemed
to
invade
her
whole
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
stay
with
you
till
Mr.
Pontellier
comes
?
''
asked
Robert
,
seating
*NL*
himself
on
the
outer
edge
of
one
of
the
steps
and
taking
hold
of
the
*NL*
hammock
rope
which
was
fastened
to
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wish
.
Do
n't
swing
the
hammock
.
Will
you
get
my
white
shawl
which
*NL*
I
left
on
the
window-sill
over
at
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
chilly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
shall
be
presently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently
?
''
he
laughed
.
``
Do
you
know
what
time
it
is
?
How
long
are
you
*NL*
going
to
stay
out
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Will
you
get
the
shawl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
will
,
''
he
said
,
rising
.
He
went
over
to
the
house
,
walking
*NL*
along
the
grass
.
She
watched
his
figure
pass
in
and
out
of
the
strips
of
*NL*
moonlight
.
It
was
past
midnight
.
It
was
very
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
with
the
shawl
she
took
it
and
kept
it
in
her
hand
.
She
*NL*
did
not
put
it
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
say
I
should
stay
till
Mr.
Pontellier
came
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
you
might
if
you
wished
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seated
himself
again
and
rolled
a
cigarette
,
which
he
smoked
in
*NL*
silence
.
Neither
did
Mrs.
Pontellier
speak
.
No
multitude
of
words
*NL*
could
have
been
more
significant
than
those
moments
of
silence
,
or
more
*NL*
pregnant
with
the
first-felt
throbbings
of
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
voices
of
the
bathers
were
heard
approaching
,
Robert
said
*NL*
good-night
.
She
did
not
answer
him
.
He
thought
she
was
asleep
.
Again
*NL*
she
watched
his
figure
pass
in
and
out
of
the
strips
of
moonlight
as
he
*NL*
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
out
here
,
Edna
?
I
thought
I
should
find
you
in
bed
,
''
*NL*
said
her
husband
,
when
he
discovered
her
lying
there
.
He
had
walked
up
*NL*
with
Madame
Lebrun
and
left
her
at
the
house
.
His
wife
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
asleep
?
''
he
asked
,
bending
down
close
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
Her
eyes
gleamed
bright
and
intense
,
with
no
sleepy
shadows
,
as
*NL*
they
looked
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
it
is
past
one
o'clock
?
Come
on
,
''
and
he
mounted
the
steps
*NL*
and
went
into
their
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edna
!
''
called
Mr.
Pontellier
from
within
,
after
a
few
moments
had
gone
*NL*
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wait
for
me
,
''
she
answered
.
He
thrust
his
head
through
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
take
cold
out
there
,
''
he
said
,
irritably
.
``
What
folly
is
this
?
*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
cold
;
I
have
my
shawl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mosquitoes
will
devour
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
mosquitoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
him
moving
about
the
room
;
every
sound
indicating
impatience
*NL*
and
irritation
.
Another
time
she
would
have
gone
in
at
his
request
.
She
*NL*
would
,
through
habit
,
have
yielded
to
his
desire
;
not
with
any
sense
of
*NL*
submission
or
obedience
to
his
compelling
wishes
,
but
unthinkingly
,
as
*NL*
we
walk
,
move
,
sit
,
stand
,
go
through
the
daily
treadmill
of
the
life
*NL*
which
has
been
portioned
out
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edna
,
dear
,
are
you
not
coming
in
soon
?
''
he
asked
again
,
this
time
*NL*
fondly
,
with
a
note
of
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
am
going
to
stay
out
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
more
than
folly
,
''
he
blurted
out
.
``
I
ca
n't
permit
you
to
stay
*NL*
out
there
all
night
.
You
must
come
in
the
house
instantly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
writhing
motion
she
settled
herself
more
securely
in
the
hammock
.
*NL*
She
perceived
that
her
will
had
blazed
up
,
stubborn
and
resistant
.
She
*NL*
could
not
at
that
moment
have
done
other
than
denied
and
resisted
.
She
*NL*
wondered
if
her
husband
had
ever
spoken
to
her
like
that
before
,
and
if
*NL*
she
had
submitted
to
his
command
.
Of
course
she
had
;
she
remembered
that
*NL*
she
had
.
But
she
could
not
realize
why
or
how
she
should
have
yielded
,
*NL*
feeling
as
she
then
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leonce
,
go
to
bed
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
mean
to
stay
out
here
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
*NL*
go
in
,
and
I
do
n't
intend
to
.
Do
n't
speak
to
me
like
that
again
;
I
shall
*NL*
not
answer
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
had
prepared
for
bed
,
but
he
slipped
on
an
extra
garment
.
*NL*
He
opened
a
bottle
of
wine
,
of
which
he
kept
a
small
and
select
supply
*NL*
in
a
buffet
of
his
own
.
He
drank
a
glass
of
the
wine
and
went
out
on
the
*NL*
gallery
and
offered
a
glass
to
his
wife
.
She
did
not
wish
any
.
He
drew
*NL*
up
the
rocker
,
hoisted
his
slippered
feet
on
the
rail
,
and
proceeded
*NL*
to
smoke
a
cigar
.
He
smoked
two
cigars
;
then
he
went
inside
and
drank
*NL*
another
glass
of
wine
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
again
declined
to
accept
a
glass
*NL*
when
it
was
offered
to
her
.
Mr.
Pontellier
once
more
seated
himself
with
*NL*
elevated
feet
,
and
after
a
reasonable
interval
of
time
smoked
some
more
*NL*
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
began
to
feel
like
one
who
awakens
gradually
out
of
a
dream
,
a
*NL*
delicious
,
grotesque
,
impossible
dream
,
to
feel
again
the
realities
*NL*
pressing
into
her
soul
.
The
physical
need
for
sleep
began
to
overtake
*NL*
her
;
the
exuberance
which
had
sustained
and
exalted
her
spirit
left
her
*NL*
helpless
and
yielding
to
the
conditions
which
crowded
her
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stillest
hour
of
the
night
had
come
,
the
hour
before
dawn
,
when
the
*NL*
world
seems
to
hold
its
breath
.
The
moon
hung
low
,
and
had
turned
from
*NL*
silver
to
copper
in
the
sleeping
sky
.
The
old
owl
no
longer
hooted
,
and
*NL*
the
water-oaks
had
ceased
to
moan
as
they
bent
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
arose
,
cramped
from
lying
so
long
and
still
in
the
hammock
.
She
*NL*
tottered
up
the
steps
,
clutching
feebly
at
the
post
before
passing
into
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
in
,
Leonce
?
''
she
asked
,
turning
her
face
toward
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
glance
following
a
misty
puff
of
smoke
.
*NL*
``
Just
as
soon
as
I
have
finished
my
cigar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
but
a
few
hours
.
They
were
troubled
and
feverish
hours
,
*NL*
disturbed
with
dreams
that
were
intangible
,
that
eluded
her
,
leaving
*NL*
only
an
impression
upon
her
half-awakened
senses
of
something
*NL*
unattainable
.
She
was
up
and
dressed
in
the
cool
of
the
early
morning
.
*NL*
The
air
was
invigorating
and
steadied
somewhat
her
faculties
.
However
,
*NL*
she
was
not
seeking
refreshment
or
help
from
any
source
,
either
external
*NL*
or
from
within
.
She
was
blindly
following
whatever
impulse
moved
her
,
*NL*
as
if
she
had
placed
herself
in
alien
hands
for
direction
,
and
freed
her
*NL*
soul
of
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
people
at
that
early
hour
were
still
in
bed
and
asleep
.
*NL*
A
few
,
who
intended
to
go
over
to
the
Cheniere
for
mass
,
were
moving
*NL*
about
.
The
lovers
,
who
had
laid
their
plans
the
night
before
,
were
*NL*
already
strolling
toward
the
wharf
.
The
lady
in
black
,
with
her
Sunday
*NL*
prayer-book
,
velvet
and
gold-clasped
,
and
her
Sunday
silver
beads
,
was
*NL*
following
them
at
no
great
distance
.
Old
Monsieur
Farival
was
up
,
and
*NL*
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
do
anything
that
suggested
itself
.
He
*NL*
put
on
his
big
straw
hat
,
and
taking
his
umbrella
from
the
stand
in
the
*NL*
hall
,
followed
the
lady
in
black
,
never
overtaking
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
negro
girl
who
worked
Madame
Lebrun
's
sewing-machine
was
*NL*
sweeping
the
galleries
with
long
,
absent-minded
strokes
of
the
broom
.
*NL*
Edna
sent
her
up
into
the
house
to
awaken
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
I
am
going
to
the
Cheniere
.
The
boat
is
ready
;
tell
him
to
*NL*
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
soon
joined
her
.
She
had
never
sent
for
him
before
.
She
had
never
*NL*
asked
for
him
.
She
had
never
seemed
to
want
him
before
.
She
did
not
*NL*
appear
conscious
that
she
had
done
anything
unusual
in
commanding
*NL*
his
presence
.
He
was
apparently
equally
unconscious
of
anything
*NL*
extraordinary
in
the
situation
.
But
his
face
was
suffused
with
a
quiet
*NL*
glow
when
he
met
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
together
back
to
the
kitchen
to
drink
coffee
.
There
was
no
*NL*
time
to
wait
for
any
nicety
of
service
.
They
stood
outside
the
window
*NL*
and
the
cook
passed
them
their
coffee
and
a
roll
,
which
they
drank
and
*NL*
ate
from
the
window-sill
.
Edna
said
it
tasted
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
thought
of
coffee
nor
of
anything
.
He
told
her
he
had
often
*NL*
noticed
that
she
lacked
forethought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
enough
to
think
of
going
to
the
Cheniere
and
waking
you
up
?
''
*NL*
she
laughed
.
``
Do
I
have
to
think
of
everything
?
--
as
Leonce
says
when
*NL*
he
's
in
a
bad
humor
.
I
do
n't
blame
him
;
he
'd
never
be
in
a
bad
humor
if
*NL*
it
were
n't
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
a
short
cut
across
the
sands
.
At
a
distance
they
could
see
*NL*
the
curious
procession
moving
toward
the
wharf
--
the
lovers
,
shoulder
to
*NL*
shoulder
,
creeping
;
the
lady
in
black
,
gaining
steadily
upon
them
;
old
*NL*
Monsieur
Farival
,
losing
ground
inch
by
inch
,
and
a
young
barefooted
*NL*
Spanish
girl
,
with
a
red
kerchief
on
her
head
and
a
basket
on
her
arm
,
*NL*
bringing
up
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
knew
the
girl
,
and
he
talked
to
her
a
little
in
the
boat
.
No
one
*NL*
present
understood
what
they
said
.
Her
name
was
Mariequita
.
She
had
a
*NL*
round
,
sly
,
piquant
face
and
pretty
black
eyes
.
Her
hands
were
small
,
*NL*
and
she
kept
them
folded
over
the
handle
of
her
basket
.
Her
feet
were
*NL*
broad
and
coarse
.
She
did
not
strive
to
hide
them
.
Edna
looked
at
her
*NL*
feet
,
and
noticed
the
sand
and
slime
between
her
brown
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beaudelet
grumbled
because
Mariequita
was
there
,
taking
up
so
much
room
.
*NL*
In
reality
he
was
annoyed
at
having
old
Monsieur
Farival
,
who
considered
*NL*
himself
the
better
sailor
of
the
two
.
But
he
would
not
quarrel
with
*NL*
so
old
a
man
as
Monsieur
Farival
,
so
he
quarreled
with
Mariequita
.
The
*NL*
girl
was
deprecatory
at
one
moment
,
appealing
to
Robert
.
She
was
saucy
*NL*
the
next
,
moving
her
head
up
and
down
,
making
``
eyes
''
at
Robert
and
*NL*
making
``
mouths
''
at
Beaudelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
were
all
alone
.
They
saw
nothing
,
they
heard
nothing
.
The
*NL*
lady
in
black
was
counting
her
beads
for
the
third
time
.
Old
Monsieur
*NL*
Farival
talked
incessantly
of
what
he
knew
about
handling
a
boat
,
and
of
*NL*
what
Beaudelet
did
not
know
on
the
same
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
liked
it
all
.
She
looked
Mariequita
up
and
down
,
from
her
ugly
*NL*
brown
toes
to
her
pretty
black
eyes
,
and
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
she
look
at
me
like
that
?
''
inquired
the
girl
of
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
she
thinks
you
are
pretty
.
Shall
I
ask
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Is
she
your
sweetheart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
married
lady
,
and
has
two
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
well
!
Francisco
ran
away
with
Sylvano
's
wife
,
who
had
four
*NL*
children
.
They
took
all
his
money
and
one
of
the
children
and
stole
his
*NL*
boat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hush
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
those
two
married
over
there
--
leaning
on
each
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
laughed
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
echoed
Mariequita
,
with
a
serious
,
confirmatory
bob
of
*NL*
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
high
up
and
beginning
to
bite
.
The
swift
breeze
seemed
*NL*
to
Edna
to
bury
the
sting
of
it
into
the
pores
of
her
face
and
hands
.
*NL*
Robert
held
his
umbrella
over
her
.
As
they
went
cutting
sidewise
through
*NL*
the
water
,
the
sails
bellied
taut
,
with
the
wind
filling
and
overflowing
*NL*
them
.
Old
Monsieur
Farival
laughed
sardonically
at
something
as
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
sails
,
and
Beaudelet
swore
at
the
old
man
under
his
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sailing
across
the
bay
to
the
Cheniere
Caminada
,
Edna
felt
as
if
she
*NL*
were
being
borne
away
from
some
anchorage
which
had
held
her
fast
,
whose
*NL*
chains
had
been
loosening
--
had
snapped
the
night
before
when
the
mystic
*NL*
spirit
was
abroad
,
leaving
her
free
to
drift
whithersoever
she
chose
*NL*
to
set
her
sails
.
Robert
spoke
to
her
incessantly
;
he
no
longer
noticed
*NL*
Mariequita
.
The
girl
had
shrimps
in
her
bamboo
basket
.
They
were
covered
*NL*
with
Spanish
moss
.
She
beat
the
moss
down
impatiently
,
and
muttered
to
*NL*
herself
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
to
Grande
Terre
to-morrow
?
''
said
Robert
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
up
the
hill
to
the
old
fort
and
look
at
the
little
wriggling
gold
*NL*
snakes
,
and
watch
the
lizards
sun
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
away
toward
Grande
Terre
and
thought
she
would
like
to
be
*NL*
alone
there
with
Robert
,
in
the
sun
,
listening
to
the
ocean
's
roar
and
*NL*
watching
the
slimy
lizards
writhe
in
and
out
among
the
ruins
of
the
old
*NL*
fort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
next
day
or
the
next
we
can
sail
to
the
Bayou
Brulow
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
--
cast
bait
for
fish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
we
'll
go
back
to
Grande
Terre
.
Let
the
fish
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
wherever
you
like
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
have
Tonie
come
over
and
*NL*
help
me
patch
and
trim
my
boat
.
We
shall
not
need
Beaudelet
nor
any
one
.
*NL*
Are
you
afraid
of
the
pirogue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
take
you
some
night
in
the
pirogue
when
the
moon
shines
.
*NL*
Maybe
your
Gulf
spirit
will
whisper
to
you
in
which
of
these
islands
the
*NL*
treasures
are
hidden
--
direct
you
to
the
very
spot
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
in
a
day
we
should
be
rich
!
''
she
laughed
.
``
I
'd
give
it
all
to
you
,
*NL*
the
pirate
gold
and
every
bit
of
treasure
we
could
dig
up
.
I
think
you
*NL*
would
know
how
to
spend
it
.
Pirate
gold
is
n't
a
thing
to
be
hoarded
or
*NL*
utilized
.
It
is
something
to
squander
and
throw
to
the
four
winds
,
for
*NL*
the
fun
of
seeing
the
golden
specks
fly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
share
it
,
and
scatter
it
together
,
''
he
said
.
His
face
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
went
together
up
to
the
quaint
little
Gothic
church
of
Our
Lady
*NL*
of
Lourdes
,
gleaming
all
brown
and
yellow
with
paint
in
the
sun
's
glare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Beaudelet
remained
behind
,
tinkering
at
his
boat
,
and
Mariequita
*NL*
walked
away
with
her
basket
of
shrimps
,
casting
a
look
of
childish
ill
*NL*
humor
and
reproach
at
Robert
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
feeling
of
oppression
and
drowsiness
overcame
Edna
during
the
service
.
*NL*
Her
head
began
to
ache
,
and
the
lights
on
the
altar
swayed
before
*NL*
her
eyes
.
Another
time
she
might
have
made
an
effort
to
regain
her
*NL*
composure
;
but
her
one
thought
was
to
quit
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
*NL*
the
church
and
reach
the
open
air
.
She
arose
,
climbing
over
Robert
's
*NL*
feet
with
a
muttered
apology
.
Old
Monsieur
Farival
,
flurried
,
curious
,
*NL*
stood
up
,
but
upon
seeing
that
Robert
had
followed
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
he
*NL*
sank
back
into
his
seat
.
He
whispered
an
anxious
inquiry
of
the
lady
in
*NL*
black
,
who
did
not
notice
him
or
reply
,
but
kept
her
eyes
fastened
upon
*NL*
the
pages
of
her
velvet
prayer-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
felt
giddy
and
almost
overcome
,
''
Edna
said
,
lifting
her
hands
*NL*
instinctively
to
her
head
and
pushing
her
straw
hat
up
from
her
*NL*
forehead
.
``
I
could
n't
have
stayed
through
the
service
.
''
They
were
*NL*
outside
in
the
shadow
of
the
church
.
Robert
was
full
of
solicitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
folly
to
have
thought
of
going
in
the
first
place
,
let
alone
*NL*
staying
.
Come
over
to
Madame
Antoine
's
;
you
can
rest
there
.
''
He
took
her
*NL*
arm
and
led
her
away
,
looking
anxiously
and
continuously
down
into
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
still
it
was
,
with
only
the
voice
of
the
sea
whispering
through
the
*NL*
reeds
that
grew
in
the
salt-water
pools
!
The
long
line
of
little
gray
,
*NL*
weather-beaten
houses
nestled
peacefully
among
the
orange
trees
.
It
must
*NL*
always
have
been
God
's
day
on
that
low
,
drowsy
island
,
Edna
thought
.
*NL*
They
stopped
,
leaning
over
a
jagged
fence
made
of
sea-drift
,
to
ask
*NL*
for
water
.
A
youth
,
a
mild-faced
Acadian
,
was
drawing
water
from
the
*NL*
cistern
,
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
rusty
buoy
,
with
an
opening
on
*NL*
one
side
,
sunk
in
the
ground
.
The
water
which
the
youth
handed
to
them
*NL*
in
a
tin
pail
was
not
cold
to
taste
,
but
it
was
cool
to
her
heated
face
,
*NL*
and
it
greatly
revived
and
refreshed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Antoine
's
cot
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
.
She
welcomed
*NL*
them
with
all
the
native
hospitality
,
as
she
would
have
opened
her
door
*NL*
to
let
the
sunlight
in
.
She
was
fat
,
and
walked
heavily
and
clumsily
*NL*
across
the
floor
.
She
could
speak
no
English
,
but
when
Robert
made
her
*NL*
understand
that
the
lady
who
accompanied
him
was
ill
and
desired
to
*NL*
rest
,
she
was
all
eagerness
to
make
Edna
feel
at
home
and
to
dispose
of
*NL*
her
comfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
place
was
immaculately
clean
,
and
the
big
,
four-posted
bed
,
*NL*
snow-white
,
invited
one
to
repose
.
It
stood
in
a
small
side
room
which
*NL*
looked
out
across
a
narrow
grass
plot
toward
the
shed
,
where
there
was
a
*NL*
disabled
boat
lying
keel
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Antoine
had
not
gone
to
mass
.
Her
son
Tonie
had
,
but
she
supposed
*NL*
he
would
soon
be
back
,
and
she
invited
Robert
to
be
seated
and
wait
for
*NL*
him
.
But
he
went
and
sat
outside
the
door
and
smoked
.
Madame
Antoine
*NL*
busied
herself
in
the
large
front
room
preparing
dinner
.
She
was
boiling
*NL*
mullets
over
a
few
red
coals
in
the
huge
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
,
left
alone
in
the
little
side
room
,
loosened
her
clothes
,
removing
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
them
.
She
bathed
her
face
,
her
neck
and
arms
in
*NL*
the
basin
that
stood
between
the
windows
.
She
took
off
her
shoes
and
*NL*
stockings
and
stretched
herself
in
the
very
center
of
the
high
,
white
*NL*
bed
.
How
luxurious
it
felt
to
rest
thus
in
a
strange
,
quaint
bed
,
*NL*
with
its
sweet
country
odor
of
laurel
lingering
about
the
sheets
and
*NL*
mattress
!
She
stretched
her
strong
limbs
that
ached
a
little
.
She
ran
*NL*
her
fingers
through
her
loosened
hair
for
a
while
.
She
looked
at
her
*NL*
round
arms
as
she
held
them
straight
up
and
rubbed
them
one
after
the
*NL*
other
,
observing
closely
,
as
if
it
were
something
she
saw
for
the
first
*NL*
time
,
the
fine
,
firm
quality
and
texture
of
her
flesh
.
She
clasped
her
*NL*
hands
easily
above
her
head
,
and
it
was
thus
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
lightly
at
first
,
half
awake
and
drowsily
attentive
to
the
*NL*
things
about
her
.
She
could
hear
Madame
Antoine
's
heavy
,
scraping
tread
*NL*
as
she
walked
back
and
forth
on
the
sanded
floor
.
Some
chickens
were
*NL*
clucking
outside
the
windows
,
scratching
for
bits
of
gravel
in
the
*NL*
grass
.
Later
she
half
heard
the
voices
of
Robert
and
Tonie
talking
under
*NL*
the
shed
.
She
did
not
stir
.
Even
her
eyelids
rested
numb
and
heavily
*NL*
over
her
sleepy
eyes
.
The
voices
went
on
--
Tonie
's
slow
,
Acadian
drawl
,
*NL*
Robert
's
quick
,
soft
,
smooth
French
.
She
understood
French
imperfectly
*NL*
unless
directly
addressed
,
and
the
voices
were
only
part
of
the
other
*NL*
drowsy
,
muffled
sounds
lulling
her
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Edna
awoke
it
was
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
slept
long
and
*NL*
soundly
.
The
voices
were
hushed
under
the
shed
.
Madame
Antoine
's
step
*NL*
was
no
longer
to
be
heard
in
the
adjoining
room
.
Even
the
chickens
had
*NL*
gone
elsewhere
to
scratch
and
cluck
.
The
mosquito
bar
was
drawn
over
*NL*
her
;
the
old
woman
had
come
in
while
she
slept
and
let
down
the
bar
.
*NL*
Edna
arose
quietly
from
the
bed
,
and
looking
between
the
curtains
of
the
*NL*
window
,
she
saw
by
the
slanting
rays
of
the
sun
that
the
afternoon
was
*NL*
far
advanced
.
Robert
was
out
there
under
the
shed
,
reclining
in
the
*NL*
shade
against
the
sloping
keel
of
the
overturned
boat
.
He
was
reading
*NL*
from
a
book
.
Tonie
was
no
longer
with
him
.
She
wondered
what
had
become
*NL*
of
the
rest
of
the
party
.
She
peeped
out
at
him
two
or
three
times
as
*NL*
she
stood
washing
herself
in
the
little
basin
between
the
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Antoine
had
laid
some
coarse
,
clean
towels
upon
a
chair
,
and
had
*NL*
placed
a
box
of
poudre
de
riz
within
easy
reach
.
Edna
dabbed
the
powder
*NL*
upon
her
nose
and
cheeks
as
she
looked
at
herself
closely
in
the
little
*NL*
distorted
mirror
which
hung
on
the
wall
above
the
basin
.
Her
eyes
were
*NL*
bright
and
wide
awake
and
her
face
glowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
completed
her
toilet
she
walked
into
the
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
She
was
very
hungry
.
No
one
was
there
.
But
there
was
a
cloth
spread
upon
*NL*
the
table
that
stood
against
the
wall
,
and
a
cover
was
laid
for
one
,
*NL*
with
a
crusty
brown
loaf
and
a
bottle
of
wine
beside
the
plate
.
Edna
bit
*NL*
a
piece
from
the
brown
loaf
,
tearing
it
with
her
strong
,
white
teeth
.
*NL*
She
poured
some
of
the
wine
into
the
glass
and
drank
it
down
.
Then
she
*NL*
went
softly
out
of
doors
,
and
plucking
an
orange
from
the
low-hanging
*NL*
bough
of
a
tree
,
threw
it
at
Robert
,
who
did
not
know
she
was
awake
and
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
illumination
broke
over
his
whole
face
when
he
saw
her
and
joined
her
*NL*
under
the
orange
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
years
have
I
slept
?
''
she
inquired
.
``
The
whole
island
seems
*NL*
changed
.
A
new
race
of
beings
must
have
sprung
up
,
leaving
only
you
and
*NL*
me
as
past
relics
.
How
many
ages
ago
did
Madame
Antoine
and
Tonie
die
?
*NL*
and
when
did
our
people
from
Grand
Isle
disappear
from
the
earth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
familiarly
adjusted
a
ruffle
upon
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
slept
precisely
one
hundred
years
.
I
was
left
here
to
guard
*NL*
your
slumbers
;
and
for
one
hundred
years
I
have
been
out
under
the
shed
*NL*
reading
a
book
.
The
only
evil
I
could
n't
prevent
was
to
keep
a
broiled
*NL*
fowl
from
drying
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
has
turned
to
stone
,
still
will
I
eat
it
,
''
said
Edna
,
moving
with
*NL*
him
into
the
house
.
``
But
really
,
what
has
become
of
Monsieur
Farival
and
*NL*
the
others
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
hours
ago
.
When
they
found
that
you
were
sleeping
they
thought
*NL*
it
best
not
to
awake
you
.
Any
way
,
I
would
n't
have
let
them
.
What
was
I
*NL*
here
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
Leonce
will
be
uneasy
!
''
she
speculated
,
as
she
seated
*NL*
herself
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
;
he
knows
you
are
with
me
,
''
Robert
replied
,
as
he
*NL*
busied
himself
among
sundry
pans
and
covered
dishes
which
had
been
left
*NL*
standing
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
Madame
Antoine
and
her
son
?
''
asked
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
to
Vespers
,
and
to
visit
some
friends
,
I
believe
.
I
am
to
take
you
*NL*
back
in
Tonie
's
boat
whenever
you
are
ready
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stirred
the
smoldering
ashes
till
the
broiled
fowl
began
to
sizzle
*NL*
afresh
.
He
served
her
with
no
mean
repast
,
dripping
the
coffee
anew
*NL*
and
sharing
it
with
her
.
Madame
Antoine
had
cooked
little
else
than
*NL*
the
mullets
,
but
while
Edna
slept
Robert
had
foraged
the
island
.
He
was
*NL*
childishly
gratified
to
discover
her
appetite
,
and
to
see
the
relish
*NL*
with
which
she
ate
the
food
which
he
had
procured
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
right
away
?
''
she
asked
,
after
draining
her
glass
and
*NL*
brushing
together
the
crumbs
of
the
crusty
loaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
is
n't
as
low
as
it
will
be
in
two
hours
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
will
be
gone
in
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
it
go
;
who
cares
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
a
good
while
under
the
orange
trees
,
till
Madame
Antoine
*NL*
came
back
,
panting
,
waddling
,
with
a
thousand
apologies
to
explain
*NL*
her
absence
.
Tonie
did
not
dare
to
return
.
He
was
shy
,
and
would
not
*NL*
willingly
face
any
woman
except
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
pleasant
to
stay
there
under
the
orange
trees
,
while
the
sun
*NL*
dipped
lower
and
lower
,
turning
the
western
sky
to
flaming
copper
and
*NL*
gold
.
The
shadows
lengthened
and
crept
out
like
stealthy
,
grotesque
*NL*
monsters
across
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
and
Robert
both
sat
upon
the
ground
--
that
is
,
he
lay
upon
the
*NL*
ground
beside
her
,
occasionally
picking
at
the
hem
of
her
muslin
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Antoine
seated
her
fat
body
,
broad
and
squat
,
upon
a
bench
beside
*NL*
the
door
.
She
had
been
talking
all
the
afternoon
,
and
had
wound
herself
*NL*
up
to
the
storytelling
pitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
stories
she
told
them
!
But
twice
in
her
life
she
had
left
the
*NL*
Cheniere
Caminada
,
and
then
for
the
briefest
span
.
All
her
years
she
*NL*
had
squatted
and
waddled
there
upon
the
island
,
gathering
legends
of
the
*NL*
Baratarians
and
the
sea
.
The
night
came
on
,
with
the
moon
to
lighten
*NL*
it
.
Edna
could
hear
the
whispering
voices
of
dead
men
and
the
click
of
*NL*
muffled
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
and
Robert
stepped
into
Tonie
's
boat
,
with
the
red
lateen
sail
,
*NL*
misty
spirit
forms
were
prowling
in
the
shadows
and
among
the
reeds
,
and
*NL*
upon
the
water
were
phantom
ships
,
speeding
to
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
youngest
boy
,
Etienne
,
had
been
very
naughty
,
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
said
,
as
she
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
his
mother
.
He
had
been
*NL*
unwilling
to
go
to
bed
and
had
made
a
scene
;
whereupon
she
had
taken
*NL*
charge
of
him
and
pacified
him
as
well
as
she
could
.
Raoul
had
been
in
*NL*
bed
and
asleep
for
two
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youngster
was
in
his
long
white
nightgown
,
that
kept
tripping
him
*NL*
up
as
Madame
Ratignolle
led
him
along
by
the
hand
.
With
the
other
chubby
*NL*
fist
he
rubbed
his
eyes
,
which
were
heavy
with
sleep
and
ill
humor
.
Edna
*NL*
took
him
in
her
arms
,
and
seating
herself
in
the
rocker
,
began
to
coddle
*NL*
and
caress
him
,
calling
him
all
manner
of
tender
names
,
soothing
him
to
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
more
than
nine
o'clock
.
No
one
had
yet
gone
to
bed
but
the
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leonce
had
been
very
uneasy
at
first
,
Madame
Ratignolle
said
,
and
had
*NL*
wanted
to
start
at
once
for
the
Cheniere
.
But
Monsieur
Farival
had
*NL*
assured
him
that
his
wife
was
only
overcome
with
sleep
and
fatigue
,
that
*NL*
Tonie
would
bring
her
safely
back
later
in
the
day
;
and
he
had
thus
been
*NL*
dissuaded
from
crossing
the
bay
.
He
had
gone
over
to
Klein
's
,
looking
*NL*
up
some
cotton
broker
whom
he
wished
to
see
in
regard
to
securities
,
*NL*
exchanges
,
stocks
,
bonds
,
or
something
of
the
sort
,
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
did
not
remember
what
.
He
said
he
would
not
remain
away
late
.
She
*NL*
herself
was
suffering
from
heat
and
oppression
,
she
said
.
She
carried
*NL*
a
bottle
of
salts
and
a
large
fan
.
She
would
not
consent
to
remain
*NL*
with
Edna
,
for
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
alone
,
and
he
detested
above
all
*NL*
things
to
be
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Etienne
had
fallen
asleep
Edna
bore
him
into
the
back
room
,
and
*NL*
Robert
went
and
lifted
the
mosquito
bar
that
she
might
lay
the
child
*NL*
comfortably
in
his
bed
.
The
quadroon
had
vanished
.
When
they
emerged
*NL*
from
the
cottage
Robert
bade
Edna
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
we
have
been
together
the
whole
livelong
day
,
Robert
--
since
*NL*
early
this
morning
?
''
she
said
at
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
but
the
hundred
years
when
you
were
sleeping
.
Goodnight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
and
went
away
in
the
direction
of
the
beach
.
He
did
*NL*
not
join
any
of
the
others
,
but
walked
alone
toward
the
Gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
stayed
outside
,
awaiting
her
husband
's
return
.
She
had
no
desire
*NL*
to
sleep
or
to
retire
;
nor
did
she
feel
like
going
over
to
sit
with
the
*NL*
Ratignolles
,
or
to
join
Madame
Lebrun
and
a
group
whose
animated
voices
*NL*
reached
her
as
they
sat
in
conversation
before
the
house
.
She
let
her
*NL*
mind
wander
back
over
her
stay
at
Grand
Isle
;
and
she
tried
to
discover
*NL*
wherein
this
summer
had
been
different
from
any
and
every
other
summer
*NL*
of
her
life
.
She
could
only
realize
that
she
herself
--
her
present
*NL*
self
--
was
in
some
way
different
from
the
other
self
.
That
she
was
seeing
*NL*
with
different
eyes
and
making
the
acquaintance
of
new
conditions
*NL*
in
herself
that
colored
and
changed
her
environment
,
she
did
not
yet
*NL*
suspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
why
Robert
had
gone
away
and
left
her
.
It
did
not
occur
to
*NL*
her
to
think
he
might
have
grown
tired
of
being
with
her
the
livelong
*NL*
day
.
She
was
not
tired
,
and
she
felt
that
he
was
not
.
She
regretted
that
*NL*
he
had
gone
.
It
was
so
much
more
natural
to
have
him
stay
when
he
was
*NL*
not
absolutely
required
to
leave
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Edna
waited
for
her
husband
she
sang
low
a
little
song
that
Robert
*NL*
had
sung
as
they
crossed
the
bay
.
It
began
with
``
Ah
!
Si
tu
savais
,
''
and
*NL*
every
verse
ended
with
``
si
tu
savais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
's
voice
was
not
pretentious
.
It
was
musical
and
true
.
The
voice
,
*NL*
the
notes
,
the
whole
refrain
haunted
her
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Edna
entered
the
dining-room
one
evening
a
little
late
,
as
was
her
*NL*
habit
,
an
unusually
animated
conversation
seemed
to
be
going
on
.
Several
*NL*
persons
were
talking
at
once
,
and
Victor
's
voice
was
predominating
,
*NL*
even
over
that
of
his
mother
.
Edna
had
returned
late
from
her
bath
,
had
*NL*
dressed
in
some
haste
,
and
her
face
was
flushed
.
Her
head
,
set
off
by
*NL*
her
dainty
white
gown
,
suggested
a
rich
,
rare
blossom
.
She
took
her
seat
*NL*
at
table
between
old
Monsieur
Farival
and
Madame
Ratignolle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
seated
herself
and
was
about
to
begin
to
eat
her
soup
,
which
*NL*
had
been
served
when
she
entered
the
room
,
several
persons
informed
her
*NL*
simultaneously
that
Robert
was
going
to
Mexico
.
She
laid
her
spoon
down
*NL*
and
looked
about
her
bewildered
.
He
had
been
with
her
,
reading
to
her
*NL*
all
the
morning
,
and
had
never
even
mentioned
such
a
place
as
Mexico
.
*NL*
She
had
not
seen
him
during
the
afternoon
;
she
had
heard
some
one
say
he
*NL*
was
at
the
house
,
upstairs
with
his
mother
.
This
she
had
thought
nothing
*NL*
of
,
though
she
was
surprised
when
he
did
not
join
her
later
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
she
went
down
to
the
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
across
at
him
,
where
he
sat
beside
Madame
Lebrun
,
who
*NL*
presided
.
Edna
's
face
was
a
blank
picture
of
bewilderment
,
which
she
*NL*
never
thought
of
disguising
.
He
lifted
his
eyebrows
with
the
pretext
*NL*
of
a
smile
as
he
returned
her
glance
.
He
looked
embarrassed
and
uneasy
.
*NL*
``
When
is
he
going
?
''
she
asked
of
everybody
in
general
,
as
if
Robert
were
*NL*
not
there
to
answer
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
!
''
``
This
very
evening
!
''
``
Did
you
ever
!
''
``
What
possesses
him
!
''
*NL*
were
some
of
the
replies
she
gathered
,
uttered
simultaneously
in
French
*NL*
and
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
How
can
a
person
start
off
from
Grand
Isle
*NL*
to
Mexico
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
as
if
he
were
going
over
to
Klein
's
or
*NL*
to
the
wharf
or
down
to
the
beach
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
all
along
I
was
going
to
Mexico
;
I
've
been
saying
so
for
years
!
''
*NL*
cried
Robert
,
in
an
excited
and
irritable
tone
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
*NL*
defending
himself
against
a
swarm
of
stinging
insects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
knocked
on
the
table
with
her
knife
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
Robert
explain
why
he
is
going
,
and
why
he
is
going
*NL*
to-night
,
''
she
called
out
.
``
Really
,
this
table
is
getting
to
be
more
and
*NL*
more
like
Bedlam
every
day
,
with
everybody
talking
at
once
.
Sometimes
--
I
*NL*
hope
God
will
forgive
me
--
but
positively
,
sometimes
I
wish
Victor
would
*NL*
lose
the
power
of
speech
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Victor
laughed
sardonically
as
he
thanked
his
mother
for
her
holy
wish
,
*NL*
of
which
he
failed
to
see
the
benefit
to
anybody
,
except
that
it
might
*NL*
afford
her
a
more
ample
opportunity
and
license
to
talk
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Farival
thought
that
Victor
should
have
been
taken
out
in
*NL*
mid-ocean
in
his
earliest
youth
and
drowned
.
Victor
thought
there
would
*NL*
be
more
logic
in
thus
disposing
of
old
people
with
an
established
claim
*NL*
for
making
themselves
universally
obnoxious
.
Madame
Lebrun
grew
a
trifle
*NL*
hysterical
;
Robert
called
his
brother
some
sharp
,
hard
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
much
to
explain
,
mother
,
''
he
said
;
though
he
explained
,
*NL*
nevertheless
--
looking
chiefly
at
Edna
--
that
he
could
only
meet
the
*NL*
gentleman
whom
he
intended
to
join
at
Vera
Cruz
by
taking
such
and
such
*NL*
a
steamer
,
which
left
New
Orleans
on
such
a
day
;
that
Beaudelet
was
*NL*
going
out
with
his
lugger-load
of
vegetables
that
night
,
which
gave
him
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
reaching
the
city
and
making
his
vessel
in
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
did
you
make
up
your
mind
to
all
this
?
''
demanded
Monsieur
*NL*
Farival
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
afternoon
,
''
returned
Robert
,
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
time
this
afternoon
?
''
persisted
the
old
gentleman
,
with
nagging
*NL*
determination
,
as
if
he
were
cross-questioning
a
criminal
in
a
court
of
*NL*
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
,
Monsieur
Farival
,
''
Robert
replied
,
in
*NL*
a
high
voice
and
with
a
lofty
air
,
which
reminded
Edna
of
some
gentleman
*NL*
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
forced
herself
to
eat
most
of
her
soup
,
and
now
she
was
picking
*NL*
the
flaky
bits
of
a
court
bouillon
with
her
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
were
profiting
by
the
general
conversation
on
Mexico
to
speak
*NL*
in
whispers
of
matters
which
they
rightly
considered
were
interesting
*NL*
to
no
one
but
themselves
.
The
lady
in
black
had
once
received
a
pair
*NL*
of
prayer-beads
of
curious
workmanship
from
Mexico
,
with
very
special
*NL*
indulgence
attached
to
them
,
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
ascertain
*NL*
whether
the
indulgence
extended
outside
the
Mexican
border
.
Father
*NL*
Fochel
of
the
Cathedral
had
attempted
to
explain
it
;
but
he
had
not
*NL*
done
so
to
her
satisfaction
.
And
she
begged
that
Robert
would
interest
*NL*
himself
,
and
discover
,
if
possible
,
whether
she
was
entitled
to
the
*NL*
indulgence
accompanying
the
remarkably
curious
Mexican
prayer-beads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
hoped
that
Robert
would
exercise
extreme
caution
*NL*
in
dealing
with
the
Mexicans
,
who
,
she
considered
,
were
a
treacherous
*NL*
people
,
unscrupulous
and
revengeful
.
She
trusted
she
did
them
no
*NL*
injustice
in
thus
condemning
them
as
a
race
.
She
had
known
personally
*NL*
but
one
Mexican
,
who
made
and
sold
excellent
tamales
,
and
whom
she
would
*NL*
have
trusted
implicitly
,
so
soft-spoken
was
he
.
One
day
he
was
arrested
*NL*
for
stabbing
his
wife
.
She
never
knew
whether
he
had
been
hanged
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Victor
had
grown
hilarious
,
and
was
attempting
to
tell
an
anecdote
*NL*
about
a
Mexican
girl
who
served
chocolate
one
winter
in
a
restaurant
in
*NL*
Dauphine
Street
.
No
one
would
listen
to
him
but
old
Monsieur
Farival
,
*NL*
who
went
into
convulsions
over
the
droll
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
wondered
if
they
had
all
gone
mad
,
to
be
talking
and
clamoring
at
*NL*
that
rate
.
She
herself
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
about
Mexico
or
the
*NL*
Mexicans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
what
time
do
you
leave
?
''
she
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
ten
,
''
he
told
her
.
``
Beaudelet
wants
to
wait
for
the
moon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
all
ready
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
ready
.
I
shall
only
take
a
hand-bag
,
and
shall
pack
my
trunk
in
*NL*
the
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
answer
some
question
put
to
him
by
his
mother
,
and
Edna
,
*NL*
having
finished
her
black
coffee
,
left
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
directly
to
her
room
.
The
little
cottage
was
close
and
stuffy
*NL*
after
leaving
the
outer
air
.
But
she
did
not
mind
;
there
appeared
to
be
*NL*
a
hundred
different
things
demanding
her
attention
indoors
.
She
began
*NL*
to
set
the
toilet-stand
to
rights
,
grumbling
at
the
negligence
of
the
*NL*
quadroon
,
who
was
in
the
adjoining
room
putting
the
children
to
bed
.
*NL*
She
gathered
together
stray
garments
that
were
hanging
on
the
backs
of
*NL*
chairs
,
and
put
each
where
it
belonged
in
closet
or
bureau
drawer
.
She
*NL*
changed
her
gown
for
a
more
comfortable
and
commodious
wrapper
.
She
*NL*
rearranged
her
hair
,
combing
and
brushing
it
with
unusual
energy
.
Then
*NL*
she
went
in
and
assisted
the
quadroon
in
getting
the
boys
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
playful
and
inclined
to
talk
--
to
do
anything
but
lie
*NL*
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
.
Edna
sent
the
quadroon
away
to
her
supper
and
*NL*
told
her
she
need
not
return
.
Then
she
sat
and
told
the
children
*NL*
a
story
.
Instead
of
soothing
it
excited
them
,
and
added
to
their
*NL*
wakefulness
.
She
left
them
in
heated
argument
,
speculating
about
*NL*
the
conclusion
of
the
tale
which
their
mother
promised
to
finish
the
*NL*
following
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
black
girl
came
in
to
say
that
Madame
Lebrun
would
like
to
*NL*
have
Mrs.
Pontellier
go
and
sit
with
them
over
at
the
house
till
Mr.
*NL*
Robert
went
away
.
Edna
returned
answer
that
she
had
already
undressed
,
*NL*
that
she
did
not
feel
quite
well
,
but
perhaps
she
would
go
over
to
the
*NL*
house
later
.
She
started
to
dress
again
,
and
got
as
far
advanced
as
to
*NL*
remove
her
peignoir
.
But
changing
her
mind
once
more
she
resumed
*NL*
the
peignoir
,
and
went
outside
and
sat
down
before
her
door
.
She
was
*NL*
overheated
and
irritable
,
and
fanned
herself
energetically
for
a
while
.
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
came
down
to
discover
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
noise
and
confusion
at
the
table
must
have
upset
me
,
''
replied
*NL*
Edna
,
``
and
moreover
,
I
hate
shocks
and
surprises
.
The
idea
of
Robert
*NL*
starting
off
in
such
a
ridiculously
sudden
and
dramatic
way
!
As
if
*NL*
it
were
a
matter
of
life
and
death
!
Never
saying
a
word
about
it
all
*NL*
morning
when
he
was
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
agreed
Madame
Ratignolle
.
``
I
think
it
was
showing
us
all
--
you
*NL*
especially
--
very
little
consideration
.
It
would
n't
have
surprised
me
in
*NL*
any
of
the
others
;
those
Lebruns
are
all
given
to
heroics
.
But
I
must
*NL*
say
I
should
never
have
expected
such
a
thing
from
Robert
.
Are
you
not
*NL*
coming
down
?
Come
on
,
dear
;
it
does
n't
look
friendly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Edna
,
a
little
sullenly
.
``
I
ca
n't
go
to
the
trouble
of
*NL*
dressing
again
;
I
do
n't
feel
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
dress
;
you
look
all
right
;
fasten
a
belt
around
your
waist
.
*NL*
Just
look
at
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
persisted
Edna
;
``
but
you
go
on
.
Madame
Lebrun
might
be
offended
if
*NL*
we
both
stayed
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
kissed
Edna
good-night
,
and
went
away
,
being
in
truth
*NL*
rather
desirous
of
joining
in
the
general
and
animated
conversation
*NL*
which
was
still
in
progress
concerning
Mexico
and
the
Mexicans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhat
later
Robert
came
up
,
carrying
his
hand-bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
feeling
well
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
enough
.
Are
you
going
right
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lit
a
match
and
looked
at
his
watch
.
``
In
twenty
minutes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
The
sudden
and
brief
flare
of
the
match
emphasized
the
darkness
for
a
*NL*
while
.
He
sat
down
upon
a
stool
which
the
children
had
left
out
on
the
*NL*
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
a
chair
,
''
said
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
do
,
''
he
replied
.
He
put
on
his
soft
hat
and
nervously
took
it
*NL*
off
again
,
and
wiping
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
,
complained
of
the
*NL*
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
fan
,
''
said
Edna
,
offering
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
Thank
you
.
It
does
no
good
;
you
have
to
stop
fanning
some
time
,
*NL*
and
feel
all
the
more
uncomfortable
afterward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
one
of
the
ridiculous
things
which
men
always
say
.
I
have
never
*NL*
known
one
to
speak
otherwise
of
fanning
.
How
long
will
you
be
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forever
,
perhaps
.
I
do
n't
know
.
It
depends
upon
a
good
many
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
case
it
should
n't
be
forever
,
how
long
will
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
seems
to
me
perfectly
preposterous
and
uncalled
for
.
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
it
.
I
do
n't
understand
your
motive
for
silence
and
mystery
,
never
saying
*NL*
a
word
to
me
about
it
this
morning
.
''
He
remained
silent
,
not
offering
to
*NL*
defend
himself
.
He
only
said
,
after
a
moment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
part
from
me
in
any
ill
humor
.
I
never
knew
you
to
be
out
of
*NL*
patience
with
me
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
part
in
any
ill
humor
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
ca
n't
you
*NL*
understand
?
I
've
grown
used
to
seeing
you
,
to
having
you
with
me
all
*NL*
the
time
,
and
your
action
seems
unfriendly
,
even
unkind
.
You
do
n't
even
*NL*
offer
an
excuse
for
it
.
Why
,
I
was
planning
to
be
together
,
thinking
of
*NL*
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
see
you
in
the
city
next
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
was
I
,
''
he
blurted
.
``
Perhaps
that
's
the
--
''
He
stood
up
suddenly
*NL*
and
held
out
his
hand
.
``
Good-by
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Pontellier
;
good-by
.
You
*NL*
wo
n't
--
I
hope
you
wo
n't
completely
forget
me
.
''
She
clung
to
his
hand
,
*NL*
striving
to
detain
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
to
me
when
you
get
there
,
wo
n't
you
,
Robert
?
''
she
entreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
thank
you
.
Good-by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
unlike
Robert
!
The
merest
acquaintance
would
have
said
something
*NL*
more
emphatic
than
``
I
will
,
thank
you
;
good-by
,
''
to
such
a
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
evidently
already
taken
leave
of
the
people
over
at
the
house
,
*NL*
for
he
descended
the
steps
and
went
to
join
Beaudelet
,
who
was
out
there
*NL*
with
an
oar
across
his
shoulder
waiting
for
Robert
.
They
walked
away
*NL*
in
the
darkness
.
She
could
only
hear
Beaudelet
's
voice
;
Robert
had
*NL*
apparently
not
even
spoken
a
word
of
greeting
to
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
bit
her
handkerchief
convulsively
,
striving
to
hold
back
and
to
*NL*
hide
,
even
from
herself
as
she
would
have
hidden
from
another
,
the
*NL*
emotion
which
was
troubling
--
tearing
--
her
.
Her
eyes
were
brimming
with
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
she
recognized
the
symptoms
of
infatuation
which
she
*NL*
had
felt
incipiently
as
a
child
,
as
a
girl
in
her
earliest
teens
,
and
*NL*
later
as
a
young
woman
.
The
recognition
did
not
lessen
the
reality
,
the
*NL*
poignancy
of
the
revelation
by
any
suggestion
or
promise
of
instability
.
*NL*
The
past
was
nothing
to
her
;
offered
no
lesson
which
she
was
willing
to
*NL*
heed
.
The
future
was
a
mystery
which
she
never
attempted
to
penetrate
.
*NL*
The
present
alone
was
significant
;
was
hers
,
to
torture
her
as
it
was
*NL*
doing
then
with
the
biting
conviction
that
she
had
lost
that
which
she
*NL*
had
held
,
that
she
had
been
denied
that
which
her
impassioned
,
newly
*NL*
awakened
being
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
miss
your
friend
greatly
?
''
asked
Mademoiselle
Reisz
one
morning
*NL*
as
she
came
creeping
up
behind
Edna
,
who
had
just
left
her
cottage
on
*NL*
her
way
to
the
beach
.
She
spent
much
of
her
time
in
the
water
since
she
*NL*
had
acquired
finally
the
art
of
swimming
.
As
their
stay
at
Grand
Isle
*NL*
drew
near
its
close
,
she
felt
that
she
could
not
give
too
much
time
to
a
*NL*
diversion
which
afforded
her
the
only
real
pleasurable
moments
that
she
*NL*
knew
.
When
Mademoiselle
Reisz
came
and
touched
her
upon
the
shoulder
*NL*
and
spoke
to
her
,
the
woman
seemed
to
echo
the
thought
which
was
ever
in
*NL*
Edna
's
mind
;
or
,
better
,
the
feeling
which
constantly
possessed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
's
going
had
some
way
taken
the
brightness
,
the
color
,
the
meaning
*NL*
out
of
everything
.
The
conditions
of
her
life
were
in
no
way
changed
,
*NL*
but
her
whole
existence
was
dulled
,
like
a
faded
garment
which
seems
to
*NL*
be
no
longer
worth
wearing
.
She
sought
him
everywhere
--
in
others
whom
*NL*
she
induced
to
talk
about
him
.
She
went
up
in
the
mornings
to
Madame
*NL*
Lebrun
's
room
,
braving
the
clatter
of
the
old
sewing-machine
.
She
sat
*NL*
there
and
chatted
at
intervals
as
Robert
had
done
.
She
gazed
around
*NL*
the
room
at
the
pictures
and
photographs
hanging
upon
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
discovered
in
some
corner
an
old
family
album
,
which
she
examined
with
*NL*
the
keenest
interest
,
appealing
to
Madame
Lebrun
for
enlightenment
*NL*
concerning
the
many
figures
and
faces
which
she
discovered
between
its
*NL*
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
picture
of
Madame
Lebrun
with
Robert
as
a
baby
,
seated
in
*NL*
her
lap
,
a
round-faced
infant
with
a
fist
in
his
mouth
.
The
eyes
alone
*NL*
in
the
baby
suggested
the
man
.
And
that
was
he
also
in
kilts
,
at
the
age
*NL*
of
five
,
wearing
long
curls
and
holding
a
whip
in
his
hand
.
It
made
Edna
*NL*
laugh
,
and
she
laughed
,
too
,
at
the
portrait
in
his
first
long
trousers
;
*NL*
while
another
interested
her
,
taken
when
he
left
for
college
,
looking
*NL*
thin
,
long-faced
,
with
eyes
full
of
fire
,
ambition
and
great
intentions
.
*NL*
But
there
was
no
recent
picture
,
none
which
suggested
the
Robert
who
had
*NL*
gone
away
five
days
ago
,
leaving
a
void
and
wilderness
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Robert
stopped
having
his
pictures
taken
when
he
had
to
pay
for
*NL*
them
himself
!
He
found
wiser
use
for
his
money
,
he
says
,
''
explained
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
.
She
had
a
letter
from
him
,
written
before
he
left
New
*NL*
Orleans
.
Edna
wished
to
see
the
letter
,
and
Madame
Lebrun
told
her
to
*NL*
look
for
it
either
on
the
table
or
the
dresser
,
or
perhaps
it
was
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
on
the
bookshelf
.
It
possessed
the
greatest
interest
and
*NL*
attraction
for
Edna
;
the
envelope
,
its
size
and
shape
,
the
post-mark
,
*NL*
the
handwriting
.
She
examined
every
detail
of
the
outside
before
opening
*NL*
it
.
There
were
only
a
few
lines
,
setting
forth
that
he
would
leave
the
*NL*
city
that
afternoon
,
that
he
had
packed
his
trunk
in
good
shape
,
that
*NL*
he
was
well
,
and
sent
her
his
love
and
begged
to
be
affectionately
*NL*
remembered
to
all
.
There
was
no
special
message
to
Edna
except
a
*NL*
postscript
saying
that
if
Mrs.
Pontellier
desired
to
finish
the
book
*NL*
which
he
had
been
reading
to
her
,
his
mother
would
find
it
in
his
*NL*
room
,
among
other
books
there
on
the
table
.
Edna
experienced
a
pang
of
*NL*
jealousy
because
he
had
written
to
his
mother
rather
than
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
seemed
to
take
for
granted
that
she
missed
him
.
Even
her
*NL*
husband
,
when
he
came
down
the
Saturday
following
Robert
's
departure
,
*NL*
expressed
regret
that
he
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
get
on
without
him
,
Edna
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
dull
without
him
,
''
she
admitted
.
Mr.
Pontellier
had
seen
*NL*
Robert
in
the
city
,
and
Edna
asked
him
a
dozen
questions
or
more
.
Where
*NL*
had
they
met
?
On
Carondelet
Street
,
in
the
morning
.
They
had
gone
*NL*
``
in
''
and
had
a
drink
and
a
cigar
together
.
What
had
they
talked
about
?
*NL*
Chiefly
about
his
prospects
in
Mexico
,
which
Mr.
Pontellier
thought
*NL*
were
promising
.
How
did
he
look
?
How
did
he
seem
--
grave
,
or
gay
,
or
how
?
*NL*
Quite
cheerful
,
and
wholly
taken
up
with
the
idea
of
his
trip
,
which
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
found
altogether
natural
in
a
young
fellow
about
to
seek
*NL*
fortune
and
adventure
in
a
strange
,
queer
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
,
and
wondered
why
the
children
*NL*
persisted
in
playing
in
the
sun
when
they
might
be
under
the
trees
.
She
*NL*
went
down
and
led
them
out
of
the
sun
,
scolding
the
quadroon
for
not
*NL*
being
more
attentive
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
strike
her
as
in
the
least
grotesque
that
she
should
be
*NL*
making
of
Robert
the
object
of
conversation
and
leading
her
husband
to
*NL*
speak
of
him
.
The
sentiment
which
she
entertained
for
Robert
in
no
way
*NL*
resembled
that
which
she
felt
for
her
husband
,
or
had
ever
felt
,
or
ever
*NL*
expected
to
feel
.
She
had
all
her
life
long
been
accustomed
to
harbor
*NL*
thoughts
and
emotions
which
never
voiced
themselves
.
They
had
never
*NL*
taken
the
form
of
struggles
.
They
belonged
to
her
and
were
her
own
,
and
*NL*
she
entertained
the
conviction
that
she
had
a
right
to
them
and
that
*NL*
they
concerned
no
one
but
herself
.
Edna
had
once
told
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
that
she
would
never
sacrifice
herself
for
her
children
,
or
for
any
one
.
*NL*
Then
had
followed
a
rather
heated
argument
;
the
two
women
did
not
appear
*NL*
to
understand
each
other
or
to
be
talking
the
same
language
.
Edna
tried
*NL*
to
appease
her
friend
,
to
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
give
up
the
unessential
;
I
would
give
my
money
,
I
would
give
my
*NL*
life
for
my
children
;
but
I
would
n't
give
myself
.
I
ca
n't
make
it
more
*NL*
clear
;
it
's
only
something
which
I
am
beginning
to
comprehend
,
which
is
*NL*
revealing
itself
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
would
call
the
essential
,
or
what
you
mean
by
the
*NL*
unessential
,
''
said
Madame
Ratignolle
,
cheerfully
;
``
but
a
woman
who
would
*NL*
give
her
life
for
her
children
could
do
no
more
than
that
--
your
Bible
*NL*
tells
you
so
.
I
'm
sure
I
could
n't
do
more
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
you
could
!
''
laughed
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
surprised
at
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
question
the
morning
that
*NL*
lady
,
following
her
to
the
beach
,
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
and
asked
*NL*
if
she
did
not
greatly
miss
her
young
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good
morning
,
Mademoiselle
;
is
it
you
?
Why
,
of
course
I
miss
*NL*
Robert
.
Are
you
going
down
to
bathe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
go
down
to
bathe
at
the
very
end
of
the
season
when
I
*NL*
have
n't
been
in
the
surf
all
summer
,
''
replied
the
woman
,
disagreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
offered
Edna
,
in
some
embarrassment
,
for
she
should
*NL*
have
remembered
that
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
avoidance
of
the
water
had
*NL*
furnished
a
theme
for
much
pleasantry
.
Some
among
them
thought
it
was
*NL*
on
account
of
her
false
hair
,
or
the
dread
of
getting
the
violets
wet
,
*NL*
while
others
attributed
it
to
the
natural
aversion
for
water
sometimes
*NL*
believed
to
accompany
the
artistic
temperament
.
Mademoiselle
offered
*NL*
Edna
some
chocolates
in
a
paper
bag
,
which
she
took
from
her
pocket
,
*NL*
by
way
of
showing
that
she
bore
no
ill
feeling
.
She
habitually
ate
*NL*
chocolates
for
their
sustaining
quality
;
they
contained
much
nutriment
*NL*
in
small
compass
,
she
said
.
They
saved
her
from
starvation
,
as
Madame
*NL*
Lebrun
's
table
was
utterly
impossible
;
and
no
one
save
so
impertinent
a
*NL*
woman
as
Madame
Lebrun
could
think
of
offering
such
food
to
people
and
*NL*
requiring
them
to
pay
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
feel
very
lonely
without
her
son
,
''
said
Edna
,
desiring
to
*NL*
change
the
subject
.
``
Her
favorite
son
,
too
.
It
must
have
been
quite
hard
*NL*
to
let
him
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
laughed
maliciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
favorite
son
!
Oh
,
dear
!
Who
could
have
been
imposing
such
a
tale
*NL*
upon
you
?
Aline
Lebrun
lives
for
Victor
,
and
for
Victor
alone
.
She
has
*NL*
spoiled
him
into
the
worthless
creature
he
is
.
She
worships
him
and
the
*NL*
ground
he
walks
on
.
Robert
is
very
well
in
a
way
,
to
give
up
all
the
*NL*
money
he
can
earn
to
the
family
,
and
keep
the
barest
pittance
for
*NL*
himself
.
Favorite
son
,
indeed
!
I
miss
the
poor
fellow
myself
,
my
dear
.
I
*NL*
liked
to
see
him
and
to
hear
him
about
the
place
the
only
Lebrun
who
is
*NL*
worth
a
pinch
of
salt
.
He
comes
to
see
me
often
in
the
city
.
I
like
*NL*
to
play
to
him
.
That
Victor
!
hanging
would
be
too
good
for
him
.
It
's
a
*NL*
wonder
Robert
has
n't
beaten
him
to
death
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
had
great
patience
with
his
brother
,
''
offered
Edna
,
glad
*NL*
to
be
talking
about
Robert
,
no
matter
what
was
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
he
thrashed
him
well
enough
a
year
or
two
ago
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
.
*NL*
``
It
was
about
a
Spanish
girl
,
whom
Victor
considered
that
he
had
some
*NL*
sort
of
claim
upon
.
He
met
Robert
one
day
talking
to
the
girl
,
or
*NL*
walking
with
her
,
or
bathing
with
her
,
or
carrying
her
basket
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
what
;
--
and
he
became
so
insulting
and
abusive
that
Robert
gave
*NL*
him
a
thrashing
on
the
spot
that
has
kept
him
comparatively
in
order
for
*NL*
a
good
while

It
's
about
time
he
was
getting
another

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
her
name
Mariequita

''
asked
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mariequita
--
yes
,
that
was
it
;
Mariequita
.
I
had
forgotten
.
Oh
,
she
's
a
*NL*
sly
one
,
and
a
bad
one
,
that
Mariequita
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
looked
down
at
Mademoiselle
Reisz
and
wondered
how
she
could
have
*NL*
listened
to
her
venom
so
long
.
For
some
reason
she
felt
depressed
,
*NL*
almost
unhappy
.
She
had
not
intended
to
go
into
the
water
;
but
she
*NL*
donned
her
bathing
suit
,
and
left
Mademoiselle
alone
,
seated
under
the
*NL*
shade
of
the
children
's
tent
.
The
water
was
growing
cooler
as
the
season
*NL*
advanced
.
Edna
plunged
and
swam
about
with
an
abandon
that
thrilled
and
*NL*
invigorated
her
.
She
remained
a
long
time
in
the
water
,
half
hoping
that
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
would
not
wait
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mademoiselle
waited
.
She
was
very
amiable
during
the
walk
back
,
and
*NL*
raved
much
over
Edna
's
appearance
in
her
bathing
suit
.
She
talked
about
*NL*
music
.
She
hoped
that
Edna
would
go
to
see
her
in
the
city
,
and
wrote
*NL*
her
address
with
the
stub
of
a
pencil
on
a
piece
of
card
which
she
found
*NL*
in
her
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
leave
?
''
asked
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
Monday
;
and
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
following
week
,
''
answered
Edna
,
adding
,
``
It
has
been
a
pleasant
*NL*
summer
,
has
n't
it
,
Mademoiselle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
agreed
Mademoiselle
Reisz
,
with
a
shrug
,
``
rather
pleasant
,
if
it
*NL*
had
n't
been
for
the
mosquitoes
and
the
Farival
twins

XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Pontelliers
possessed
a
very
charming
home
on
Esplanade
Street
in
*NL*
New
Orleans
.
It
was
a
large
,
double
cottage
,
with
a
broad
front
veranda
,
*NL*
whose
round
,
fluted
columns
supported
the
sloping
roof
.
The
house
was
*NL*
painted
a
dazzling
white
;
the
outside
shutters
,
or
jalousies
,
were
*NL*
green
.
In
the
yard
,
which
was
kept
scrupulously
neat
,
were
flowers
and
*NL*
plants
of
every
description
which
flourishes
in
South
Louisiana
.
Within
*NL*
doors
the
appointments
were
perfect
after
the
conventional
type
.
The
*NL*
softest
carpets
and
rugs
covered
the
floors
;
rich
and
tasteful
draperies
*NL*
hung
at
doors
and
windows
.
There
were
paintings
,
selected
with
judgment
*NL*
and
discrimination
,
upon
the
walls
.
The
cut
glass
,
the
silver
,
the
heavy
*NL*
damask
which
daily
appeared
upon
the
table
were
the
envy
of
many
women
*NL*
whose
husbands
were
less
generous
than
Mr.
Pontellier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
was
very
fond
of
walking
about
his
house
examining
its
*NL*
various
appointments
and
details
,
to
see
that
nothing
was
amiss
.
He
*NL*
greatly
valued
his
possessions
,
chiefly
because
they
were
his
,
and
*NL*
derived
genuine
pleasure
from
contemplating
a
painting
,
a
statuette
,
a
*NL*
rare
lace
curtain
--
no
matter
what
--
after
he
had
bought
it
and
placed
it
*NL*
among
his
household
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Tuesday
afternoons
--
Tuesday
being
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
reception
*NL*
day
--
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
callers
--
women
who
came
in
carriages
*NL*
or
in
the
street
cars
,
or
walked
when
the
air
was
soft
and
distance
*NL*
permitted
.
A
light-colored
mulatto
boy
,
in
dress
coat
and
bearing
a
*NL*
diminutive
silver
tray
for
the
reception
of
cards
,
admitted
them
.
A
*NL*
maid
,
in
white
fluted
cap
,
offered
the
callers
liqueur
,
coffee
,
or
*NL*
chocolate
,
as
they
might
desire
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
attired
in
a
handsome
*NL*
reception
gown
,
remained
in
the
drawing-room
the
entire
afternoon
*NL*
receiving
her
visitors
.
Men
sometimes
called
in
the
evening
with
their
*NL*
wives
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
the
programme
which
Mrs.
Pontellier
had
religiously
*NL*
followed
since
her
marriage
,
six
years
before
.
Certain
evenings
during
*NL*
the
week
she
and
her
husband
attended
the
opera
or
sometimes
the
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
left
his
home
in
the
mornings
between
nine
and
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
rarely
returned
before
half-past
six
or
seven
in
the
*NL*
evening
--
dinner
being
served
at
half-past
seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
his
wife
seated
themselves
at
table
one
Tuesday
evening
,
a
few
*NL*
weeks
after
their
return
from
Grand
Isle
.
They
were
alone
together
.
*NL*
The
boys
were
being
put
to
bed
;
the
patter
of
their
bare
,
escaping
*NL*
feet
could
be
heard
occasionally
,
as
well
as
the
pursuing
voice
of
the
*NL*
quadroon
,
lifted
in
mild
protest
and
entreaty
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
did
not
*NL*
wear
her
usual
Tuesday
reception
gown
;
she
was
in
ordinary
house
dress
.
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
,
who
was
observant
about
such
things
,
noticed
it
,
as
he
*NL*
served
the
soup
and
handed
it
to
the
boy
in
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
out
,
Edna
?
Whom
did
you
have
?
Many
callers
?
''
he
asked
.
He
*NL*
tasted
his
soup
and
began
to
season
it
with
pepper
,
salt
,
vinegar
,
*NL*
mustard
--
everything
within
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
a
good
many
,
''
replied
Edna
,
who
was
eating
her
soup
with
*NL*
evident
satisfaction
.
``
I
found
their
cards
when
I
got
home
;
I
was
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
!
''
exclaimed
her
husband
,
with
something
like
genuine
consternation
*NL*
in
his
voice
as
he
laid
down
the
vinegar
cruet
and
looked
at
her
through
*NL*
his
glasses
.
``
Why
,
what
could
have
taken
you
out
on
Tuesday
?
What
did
*NL*
you
have
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
I
simply

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
you
left
some
suitable
excuse

''
said
her
husband
,
somewhat
*NL*
appeased
,
as
he
added
a
dash
of
cayenne
pepper
to
the
soup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
left
no

I
told

out

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my

I
should
think
you
'd

by
this

If

The
boy
retired
and
returned
after
a
moment
,
bringing
the
tiny
silver
*NL*
tray
,
which
was
covered
with
ladies

visiting
cards

He
handed
it
to
*NL*
Mrs.

she
said

*NL*
Joe
offered
the

to
Mr.

and
removed
the

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.

scanned
the

them
aloud

read

He
pushed

aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy

''
exclaimed
Edna
,
who
had
been
fuming
.
``
Why
are
you
taking
the

so
seriously

making
such
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

*NL*
*NL*
The
fish
was
scorched
.
Mr.
Pontellier
would
not
touch
it
.
Edna
said
she
*NL*
did
not
mind
a
little
scorched
taste
.
The
roast
was
in
some
way
not
to
*NL*
his
fancy
,
and
he
did
not
like
the
manner
in
which
the
vegetables
were
*NL*
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
spend
money
enough
in
this

*NL*
procure
at

one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
think
the
cook
was
a

returned
Edna
,
*NL*
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
she
was
when
she
first
came
;
but
cooks
are
only
human
.
They
*NL*
need
looking
after
,
like
any
other
class
of
persons
that
you
employ
.
*NL*
Suppose
I
did
n't
look
after
the
clerks
in
my
office
,
just
let
them
*NL*
run
things
their
own
way
;
they
'd
soon
make
a
nice
mess
of
me
and
my
*NL*
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
asked
Edna
,
seeing
that
her
husband
arose
*NL*
from
table
without
having
eaten
a
morsel
except
a
taste
of
the
*NL*
highly-seasoned
soup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
get
my
dinner
at
the
club
.
Good
night
.
''
He
went
into
the
*NL*
hall
,
took
his
hat
and
stick
from
the
stand
,
and
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
somewhat
familiar
with
such
scenes
.
They
had
often
made
her
very
*NL*
unhappy
.
On
a
few
previous
occasions
she
had
been
completely
deprived
of
*NL*
any
desire
to
finish
her
dinner
.
Sometimes
she
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
*NL*
to
administer
a
tardy
rebuke
to
the
cook
.
Once
she
went
to
her
room
and
*NL*
studied
the
cookbook
during
an
entire
evening
,
finally
writing
out
a
*NL*
menu
for
the
week
,
which
left
her
harassed
with
a
feeling
that
,
after
*NL*
all
,
she
had
accomplished
no
good
that
was
worth
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
evening
Edna
finished
her
dinner
alone
,
with
forced
*NL*
deliberation
.
Her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
flamed
with
some
inward
*NL*
fire
that
lighted
them
.
After
finishing
her
dinner
she
went
to
her
*NL*
room
,
having
instructed
the
boy
to
tell
any
other
callers
that
she
was
*NL*
indisposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
large
,
beautiful
room
,
rich
and
picturesque
in
the
soft
,
dim
*NL*
light
which
the
maid
had
turned
low
.
She
went
and
stood
at
an
open
*NL*
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
deep
tangle
of
the
garden
below
.
All
the
*NL*
mystery
and
witchery
of
the
night
seemed
to
have
gathered
there
amid
the
*NL*
perfumes
and
the
dusky
and
tortuous
outlines
of
flowers
and
foliage
.
*NL*
She
was
seeking
herself
and
finding
herself
in
just
such
sweet
,
*NL*
half-darkness
which
met
her
moods
.
But
the
voices
were
not
soothing
*NL*
that
came
to
her
from
the
darkness
and
the
sky
above
and
the
stars
.
They
*NL*
jeered
and
sounded
mournful
notes
without
promise
,
devoid
even
of
hope
.
*NL*
She
turned
back
into
the
room
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
down
its
*NL*
whole
length
without
stopping
,
without
resting
.
She
carried
in
her
*NL*
hands
a
thin
handkerchief
,
which
she
tore
into
ribbons
,
rolled
into
a
*NL*
ball
,
and
flung
from
her
.
Once
she
stopped
,
and
taking
off
her
wedding
*NL*
ring
,
flung
it
upon
the
carpet
.
When
she
saw
it
lying
there
,
she
stamped
*NL*
her
heel
upon
it
,
striving
to
crush
it
.
But
her
small
boot
heel
did
not
*NL*
make
an
indenture
,
not
a
mark
upon
the
little
glittering
circlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
sweeping
passion
she
seized
a
glass
vase
from
the
table
and
flung
*NL*
it
upon
the
tiles
of
the
hearth
.
She
wanted
to
destroy
something
.
The
*NL*
crash
and
clatter
were
what
she
wanted
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
maid
,
alarmed
at
the
din
of
breaking
glass
,
entered
the
room
to
*NL*
discover
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
vase
fell
upon
the
hearth
,
''
said
Edna
.
``
Never
mind
;
leave
it
till
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
might
get
some
of
the
glass
in
your
feet
,
ma'am
,
''
insisted
the
*NL*
young
woman
,
picking
up
bits
of
the
broken
vase
that
were
scattered
upon
*NL*
the
carpet
.
``
And
here
's
your
ring
,
ma'am
,
under
the
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
held
out
her
hand
,
and
taking
the
ring
,
slipped
it
upon
her
finger
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
Mr.
Pontellier
,
upon
leaving
for
his
office
,
asked
*NL*
Edna
if
she
would
not
meet
him
in
town
in
order
to
look
at
some
new
*NL*
fixtures
for
the
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
think
we
need
new
fixtures
,
Leonce
.
Do
n't
let
us
get
anything
*NL*
new
;
you
are
too
extravagant
.
I
do
n't
believe
you
ever
think
of
saving
*NL*
or
putting
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
way
to
become
rich
is
to
make
money
,
my
dear
Edna
,
not
to
save
it
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
He
regretted
that
she
did
not
feel
inclined
to
go
with
him
and
*NL*
select
new
fixtures
.
He
kissed
her
good-by
,
and
told
her
she
was
not
*NL*
looking
well
and
must
take
care
of
herself
.
She
was
unusually
pale
and
*NL*
very
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
on
the
front
veranda
as
he
quitted
the
house
,
and
absently
*NL*
picked
a
few
sprays
of
jessamine
that
grew
upon
a
trellis
near
by
.
She
*NL*
inhaled
the
odor
of
the
blossoms
and
thrust
them
into
the
bosom
of
her
*NL*
white
morning
gown
.
The
boys
were
dragging
along
the
banquette
a
small
*NL*
``
express
wagon
,
''
which
they
had
filled
with
blocks
and
sticks
.
The
*NL*
quadroon
was
following
them
with
little
quick
steps
,
having
assumed
a
*NL*
fictitious
animation
and
alacrity
for
the
occasion
.
A
fruit
vender
was
*NL*
crying
his
wares
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
looked
straight
before
her
with
a
self-absorbed
expression
upon
*NL*
her
face
.
She
felt
no
interest
in
anything
about
her
.
The
street
,
the
*NL*
children
,
the
fruit
vender
,
the
flowers
growing
there
under
her
eyes
,
*NL*
were
all
part
and
parcel
of
an
alien
world
which
had
suddenly
become
*NL*
antagonistic
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
back
into
the
house
.
She
had
thought
of
speaking
to
the
cook
*NL*
concerning
her
blunders
of
the
previous
night
;
but
Mr.
Pontellier
had
*NL*
saved
her
that
disagreeable
mission
,
for
which
she
was
so
poorly
fitted
.
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
's
arguments
were
usually
convincing
with
those
whom
he
*NL*
employed
.
He
left
home
feeling
quite
sure
that
he
and
Edna
would
sit
*NL*
down
that
evening
,
and
possibly
a
few
subsequent
evenings
,
to
a
dinner
*NL*
deserving
of
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
spent
an
hour
or
two
in
looking
over
some
of
her
old
sketches
.
*NL*
She
could
see
their
shortcomings
and
defects
,
which
were
glaring
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
She
tried
to
work
a
little
,
but
found
she
was
not
in
the
humor
.
*NL*
Finally
she
gathered
together
a
few
of
the
sketches
--
those
which
she
*NL*
considered
the
least
discreditable
;
and
she
carried
them
with
her
when
,
*NL*
a
little
later
,
she
dressed
and
left
the
house
.
She
looked
handsome
and
*NL*
distinguished
in
her
street
gown
.
The
tan
of
the
seashore
had
left
*NL*
her
face
,
and
her
forehead
was
smooth
,
white
,
and
polished
beneath
her
*NL*
heavy
,
yellow-brown
hair
.
There
were
a
few
freckles
on
her
face
,
and
a
*NL*
small
,
dark
mole
near
the
under
lip
and
one
on
the
temple
,
half-hidden
*NL*
in
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Edna
walked
along
the
street
she
was
thinking
of
Robert
.
She
was
*NL*
still
under
the
spell
of
her
infatuation
.
She
had
tried
to
forget
him
,
*NL*
realizing
the
inutility
of
remembering
.
But
the
thought
of
him
was
like
*NL*
an
obsession
,
ever
pressing
itself
upon
her
.
It
was
not
that
she
dwelt
*NL*
upon
details
of
their
acquaintance
,
or
recalled
in
any
special
or
*NL*
peculiar
way
his
personality
;
it
was
his
being
,
his
existence
,
which
*NL*
dominated
her
thought
,
fading
sometimes
as
if
it
would
melt
into
the
*NL*
mist
of
the
forgotten
,
reviving
again
with
an
intensity
which
filled
her
*NL*
with
an
incomprehensible
longing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
on
her
way
to
Madame
Ratignolle
's
.
Their
intimacy
,
begun
at
*NL*
Grand
Isle
,
had
not
declined
,
and
they
had
seen
each
other
with
some
*NL*
frequency
since
their
return
to
the
city
.
The
Ratignolles
lived
at
no
*NL*
great
distance
from
Edna
's
home
,
on
the
corner
of
a
side
street
,
where
*NL*
Monsieur
Ratignolle
owned
and
conducted
a
drug
store
which
enjoyed
a
*NL*
steady
and
prosperous
trade
.
His
father
had
been
in
the
business
before
*NL*
him
,
and
Monsieur
Ratignolle
stood
well
in
the
community
and
bore
an
*NL*
enviable
reputation
for
integrity
and
clearheadedness
.
His
family
lived
*NL*
in
commodious
apartments
over
the
store
,
having
an
entrance
on
the
side
*NL*
within
the
porte
cochere
.
There
was
something
which
Edna
thought
very
*NL*
French
,
very
foreign
,
about
their
whole
manner
of
living
.
In
the
large
*NL*
and
pleasant
salon
which
extended
across
the
width
of
the
house
,
the
*NL*
Ratignolles
entertained
their
friends
once
a
fortnight
with
a
soiree
*NL*
musicale
,
sometimes
diversified
by
card-playing
.
There
was
a
friend
who
*NL*
played
upon
the
`
cello
.
One
brought
his
flute
and
another
his
violin
,
*NL*
while
there
were
some
who
sang
and
a
number
who
performed
upon
the
piano
*NL*
with
various
degrees
of
taste
and
agility
.
The
Ratignolles
'
soirees
*NL*
musicales
were
widely
known
,
and
it
was
considered
a
privilege
to
be
*NL*
invited
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
found
her
friend
engaged
in
assorting
the
clothes
which
had
*NL*
returned
that
morning
from
the
laundry
.
She
at
once
abandoned
her
*NL*
occupation
upon
seeing
Edna
,
who
had
been
ushered
without
ceremony
into
*NL*
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Cite
can
do
it
as
well
as
I
;
it
is
really
her
business
,
''
she
explained
*NL*
to
Edna
,
who
apologized
for
interrupting
her
.
And
she
summoned
a
young
*NL*
black
woman
,
whom
she
instructed
,
in
French
,
to
be
very
careful
in
*NL*
checking
off
the
list
which
she
handed
her
.
She
told
her
to
notice
*NL*
particularly
if
a
fine
linen
handkerchief
of
Monsieur
Ratignolle
's
,
*NL*
which
was
missing
last
week
,
had
been
returned
;
and
to
be
sure
to
set
to
*NL*
one
side
such
pieces
as
required
mending
and
darning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
placing
an
arm
around
Edna
's
waist
,
she
led
her
to
the
front
of
the
*NL*
house
,
to
the
salon
,
where
it
was
cool
and
sweet
with
the
odor
of
great
*NL*
roses
that
stood
upon
the
hearth
in
jars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
there
at
home
,
in
a
*NL*
neglige
which
left
her
arms
almost
wholly
bare
and
exposed
the
rich
,
*NL*
melting
curves
of
her
white
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
shall
be
able
to
paint
your
picture
some
day
,
''
said
Edna
with
*NL*
a
smile
when
they
were
seated
.
She
produced
the
roll
of
sketches
and
*NL*
started
to
unfold
them
.
``
I
believe
I
ought
to
work
again
.
I
feel
as
if
I
*NL*
wanted
to
be
doing
something
.
What
do
you
think
of
them
?
Do
you
think
it
*NL*
worth
while
to
take
it
up
again
and
study
some
more
?
I
might
study
for
a
*NL*
while
with
Laidpore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
Madame
Ratignolle
's
opinion
in
such
a
matter
would
be
next
*NL*
to
valueless
,
that
she
herself
had
not
alone
decided
,
but
determined
;
*NL*
but
she
sought
the
words
of
praise
and
encouragement
that
would
help
her
*NL*
to
put
heart
into
her
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
talent
is
immense
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
protested
Edna
,
well
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immense
,
I
tell
you
,
''
persisted
Madame
Ratignolle
,
surveying
the
*NL*
sketches
one
by
one
,
at
close
range
,
then
holding
them
at
arm
's
length
,
*NL*
narrowing
her
eyes
,
and
dropping
her
head
on
one
side
.
``
Surely
,
this
*NL*
Bavarian
peasant
is
worthy
of
framing
;
and
this
basket
of
apples
!
never
*NL*
have
I
seen
anything
more
lifelike
.
One
might
almost
be
tempted
to
reach
*NL*
out
a
hand
and
take
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
could
not
control
a
feeling
which
bordered
upon
complacency
at
*NL*
her
friend
's
praise
,
even
realizing
,
as
she
did
,
its
true
worth
.
*NL*
She
retained
a
few
of
the
sketches
,
and
gave
all
the
rest
to
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
,
who
appreciated
the
gift
far
beyond
its
value
and
proudly
*NL*
exhibited
the
pictures
to
her
husband
when
he
came
up
from
the
store
a
*NL*
little
later
for
his
midday
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Ratignolle
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
called
the
salt
of
the
*NL*
earth
.
His
cheerfulness
was
unbounded
,
and
it
was
matched
by
his
*NL*
goodness
of
heart
,
his
broad
charity
,
and
common
sense
.
He
and
his
wife
*NL*
spoke
English
with
an
accent
which
was
only
discernible
through
its
*NL*
un-English
emphasis
and
a
certain
carefulness
and
deliberation
.
*NL*
Edna
's
husband
spoke
English
with
no
accent
whatever
.
The
Ratignolles
*NL*
understood
each
other
perfectly
.
If
ever
the
fusion
of
two
human
beings
*NL*
into
one
has
been
accomplished
on
this
sphere
it
was
surely
in
their
*NL*
union
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Edna
seated
herself
at
table
with
them
she
thought
,
``
Better
a
dinner
*NL*
of
herbs
,
''
though
it
did
not
take
her
long
to
discover
that
it
was
no
*NL*
dinner
of
herbs
,
but
a
delicious
repast
,
simple
,
choice
,
and
in
every
*NL*
way
satisfying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
delighted
to
see
her
,
though
he
found
her
*NL*
looking
not
so
well
as
at
Grand
Isle
,
and
he
advised
a
tonic
.
He
talked
*NL*
a
good
deal
on
various
topics
,
a
little
politics
,
some
city
news
and
*NL*
neighborhood
gossip
.
He
spoke
with
an
animation
and
earnestness
that
*NL*
gave
an
exaggerated
importance
to
every
syllable
he
uttered
.
His
wife
*NL*
was
keenly
interested
in
everything
he
said
,
laying
down
her
fork
the
*NL*
better
to
listen
,
chiming
in
,
taking
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
felt
depressed
rather
than
soothed
after
leaving
them
.
The
little
*NL*
glimpse
of
domestic
harmony
which
had
been
offered
her
,
gave
her
no
*NL*
regret
,
no
longing
.
It
was
not
a
condition
of
life
which
fitted
her
,
and
*NL*
she
could
see
in
it
but
an
appalling
and
hopeless
ennui
.
She
was
moved
*NL*
by
a
kind
of
commiseration
for
Madame
Ratignolle
,
--
a
pity
for
that
*NL*
colorless
existence
which
never
uplifted
its
possessor
beyond
the
region
*NL*
of
blind
contentment
,
in
which
no
moment
of
anguish
ever
visited
her
*NL*
soul
,
in
which
she
would
never
have
the
taste
of
life
's
delirium
.
Edna
*NL*
vaguely
wondered
what
she
meant
by
``
life
's
delirium
.
''
It
had
crossed
her
*NL*
thought
like
some
unsought
,
extraneous
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
could
not
help
but
think
that
it
was
very
foolish
,
very
childish
,
*NL*
to
have
stamped
upon
her
wedding
ring
and
smashed
the
crystal
vase
upon
*NL*
the
tiles
.
She
was
visited
by
no
more
outbursts
,
moving
her
to
such
*NL*
futile
expedients
.
She
began
to
do
as
she
liked
and
to
feel
as
she
*NL*
liked
.
She
completely
abandoned
her
Tuesdays
at
home
,
and
did
not
return
*NL*
the
visits
of
those
who
had
called
upon
her
.
She
made
no
ineffectual
*NL*
efforts
to
conduct
her
household
en
bonne
menagere
,
going
and
coming
as
*NL*
it
suited
her
fancy
,
and
,
so
far
as
she
was
able
,
lending
herself
to
any
*NL*
passing
caprice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
had
been
a
rather
courteous
husband
so
long
as
he
met
*NL*
a
certain
tacit
submissiveness
in
his
wife
.
But
her
new
and
unexpected
*NL*
line
of
conduct
completely
bewildered
him
.
It
shocked
him
.
Then
her
*NL*
absolute
disregard
for
her
duties
as
a
wife
angered
him
.
When
Mr.
*NL*
Pontellier
became
rude
,
Edna
grew
insolent
.
She
had
resolved
never
to
*NL*
take
another
step
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
the
utmost
folly
for
a
woman
at
the
head
of
a
household
,
*NL*
and
the
mother
of
children
,
to
spend
in
an
atelier
days
which
would
be
*NL*
better
employed
contriving
for
the
comfort
of
her
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
like
painting
,
''
answered
Edna
.
``
Perhaps
I
sha
n't
always
feel
*NL*
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
in
God
's
name
paint
!
but
do
n't
let
the
family
go
to
the
devil
.
*NL*
There
's
Madame
Ratignolle
;
because
she
keeps
up
her
music
,
she
does
n't
*NL*
let
everything
else
go
to
chaos
.
And
she
's
more
of
a
musician
than
you
*NL*
are
a
painter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
a
musician
,
and
I
'm
not
a
painter
.
It
is
n't
on
account
of
*NL*
painting
that
I
let
things
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
account
of
what
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
.
Let
me
alone
;
you
bother
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
entered
Mr.
Pontellier
's
mind
to
wonder
if
his
wife
were
*NL*
not
growing
a
little
unbalanced
mentally
.
He
could
see
plainly
that
she
*NL*
was
not
herself
.
That
is
,
he
could
not
see
that
she
was
becoming
herself
*NL*
and
daily
casting
aside
that
fictitious
self
which
we
assume
like
a
*NL*
garment
with
which
to
appear
before
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
let
her
alone
as
she
requested
,
and
went
away
to
his
office
.
*NL*
Edna
went
up
to
her
atelier
--
a
bright
room
in
the
top
of
the
house
.
*NL*
She
was
working
with
great
energy
and
interest
,
without
accomplishing
*NL*
anything
,
however
,
which
satisfied
her
even
in
the
smallest
degree
.
For
*NL*
a
time
she
had
the
whole
household
enrolled
in
the
service
of
art
.
The
*NL*
boys
posed
for
her
.
They
thought
it
amusing
at
first
,
but
the
occupation
*NL*
soon
lost
its
attractiveness
when
they
discovered
that
it
was
not
a
game
*NL*
arranged
especially
for
their
entertainment
.
The
quadroon
sat
for
hours
*NL*
before
Edna
's
palette
,
patient
as
a
savage
,
while
the
house-maid
took
*NL*
charge
of
the
children
,
and
the
drawing-room
went
undusted
.
But
the
*NL*
housemaid
,
too
,
served
her
term
as
model
when
Edna
perceived
that
the
*NL*
young
woman
's
back
and
shoulders
were
molded
on
classic
lines
,
and
that
*NL*
her
hair
,
loosened
from
its
confining
cap
,
became
an
inspiration
.
While
*NL*
Edna
worked
she
sometimes
sang
low
the
little
air
,
``
Ah
!
si
tu
savais
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
moved
her
with
recollections
.
She
could
hear
again
the
ripple
of
the
*NL*
water
,
the
flapping
sail
.
She
could
see
the
glint
of
the
moon
upon
the
*NL*
bay
,
and
could
feel
the
soft
,
gusty
beating
of
the
hot
south
wind
.
A
*NL*
subtle
current
of
desire
passed
through
her
body
,
weakening
her
hold
*NL*
upon
the
brushes
and
making
her
eyes
burn
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
days
when
she
was
very
happy
without
knowing
why
.
She
was
*NL*
happy
to
be
alive
and
breathing
,
when
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
one
*NL*
with
the
sunlight
,
the
color
,
the
odors
,
the
luxuriant
warmth
of
some
*NL*
perfect
Southern
day
.
She
liked
then
to
wander
alone
into
strange
and
*NL*
unfamiliar
places
.
She
discovered
many
a
sunny
,
sleepy
corner
,
fashioned
*NL*
to
dream
in
.
And
she
found
it
good
to
dream
and
to
be
alone
and
*NL*
unmolested
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
days
when
she
was
unhappy
,
she
did
not
know
why
,
--
when
it
did
*NL*
not
seem
worth
while
to
be
glad
or
sorry
,
to
be
alive
or
dead
;
when
life
*NL*
appeared
to
her
like
a
grotesque
pandemonium
and
humanity
like
worms
*NL*
struggling
blindly
toward
inevitable
annihilation
.
She
could
not
work
on
*NL*
such
a
day
,
nor
weave
fancies
to
stir
her
pulses
and
warm
her
blood
.

XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
such
a
mood
that
Edna
hunted
up
Mademoiselle
Reisz
.
She
*NL*
had
not
forgotten
the
rather
disagreeable
impression
left
upon
her
*NL*
by
their
last
interview
;
but
she
nevertheless
felt
a
desire
to
see
*NL*
her
--
above
all
,
to
listen
while
she
played
upon
the
piano
.
Quite
*NL*
early
in
the
afternoon
she
started
upon
her
quest
for
the
pianist
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
she
had
mislaid
or
lost
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
card
,
and
*NL*
looking
up
her
address
in
the
city
directory
,
she
found
that
the
woman
*NL*
lived
on
Bienville
Street
,
some
distance
away
.
The
directory
which
fell
*NL*
into
her
hands
was
a
year
or
more
old
,
however
,
and
upon
reaching
the
*NL*
number
indicated
,
Edna
discovered
that
the
house
was
occupied
by
a
*NL*
respectable
family
of
mulattoes
who
had
chambres
garnies
to
let
.
They
*NL*
had
been
living
there
for
six
months
,
and
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
*NL*
a
Mademoiselle
Reisz
.
In
fact
,
they
knew
nothing
of
any
of
their
*NL*
neighbors
;
their
lodgers
were
all
people
of
the
highest
distinction
,
*NL*
they
assured
Edna
.
She
did
not
linger
to
discuss
class
distinctions
with
*NL*
Madame
Pouponne
,
but
hastened
to
a
neighboring
grocery
store
,
feeling
*NL*
sure
that
Mademoiselle
would
have
left
her
address
with
the
proprietor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
Mademoiselle
Reisz
a
good
deal
better
than
he
wanted
to
know
*NL*
her
,
he
informed
his
questioner
.
In
truth
,
he
did
not
want
to
know
her
*NL*
at
all
,
or
anything
concerning
her
--
the
most
disagreeable
and
unpopular
*NL*
woman
who
ever
lived
in
Bienville
Street
.
He
thanked
heaven
she
had
left
*NL*
the
neighborhood
,
and
was
equally
thankful
that
he
did
not
know
where
*NL*
she
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
's
desire
to
see
Mademoiselle
Reisz
had
increased
tenfold
since
*NL*
these
unlooked-for
obstacles
had
arisen
to
thwart
it
.
She
was
wondering
*NL*
who
could
give
her
the
information
she
sought
,
when
it
suddenly
occurred
*NL*
to
her
that
Madame
Lebrun
would
be
the
one
most
likely
to
do
so
.
She
*NL*
knew
it
was
useless
to
ask
Madame
Ratignolle
,
who
was
on
the
most
*NL*
distant
terms
with
the
musician
,
and
preferred
to
know
nothing
*NL*
concerning
her
.
She
had
once
been
almost
as
emphatic
in
expressing
*NL*
herself
upon
the
subject
as
the
corner
grocer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
knew
that
Madame
Lebrun
had
returned
to
the
city
,
for
it
was
*NL*
the
middle
of
November
.
And
she
also
knew
where
the
Lebruns
lived
,
on
*NL*
Chartres
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
home
from
the
outside
looked
like
a
prison
,
with
iron
bars
before
*NL*
the
door
and
lower
windows
.
The
iron
bars
were
a
relic
of
the
old
*NL*
regime
,
and
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
dislodging
them
.
At
the
side
*NL*
was
a
high
fence
enclosing
the
garden
.
A
gate
or
door
opening
upon
the
*NL*
street
was
locked
.
Edna
rang
the
bell
at
this
side
garden
gate
,
and
*NL*
stood
upon
the
banquette
,
waiting
to
be
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Victor
who
opened
the
gate
for
her
.
A
black
woman
,
wiping
her
*NL*
hands
upon
her
apron
,
was
close
at
his
heels
.
Before
she
saw
them
Edna
*NL*
could
hear
them
in
altercation
,
the
woman
--
plainly
an
anomaly
--
claiming
*NL*
the
right
to
be
allowed
to
perform
her
duties
,
one
of
which
was
to
*NL*
answer
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Victor
was
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
and
he
made
*NL*
no
attempt
to
conceal
either
his
astonishment
or
his
delight
.
He
was
a
*NL*
dark-browed
,
good-looking
youngster
of
nineteen
,
greatly
resembling
*NL*
his
mother
,
but
with
ten
times
her
impetuosity
.
He
instructed
the
*NL*
black
woman
to
go
at
once
and
inform
Madame
Lebrun
that
Mrs.
Pontellier
*NL*
desired
to
see
her
.
The
woman
grumbled
a
refusal
to
do
part
of
her
duty
*NL*
when
she
had
not
been
permitted
to
do
it
all
,
and
started
back
to
her
*NL*
interrupted
task
of
weeding
the
garden
.
Whereupon
Victor
administered
*NL*
a
rebuke
in
the
form
of
a
volley
of
abuse
,
which
,
owing
to
its
rapidity
*NL*
and
incoherence
,
was
all
but
incomprehensible
to
Edna
.
Whatever
it
*NL*
was
,
the
rebuke
was
convincing
,
for
the
woman
dropped
her
hoe
and
went
*NL*
mumbling
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
did
not
wish
to
enter
.
It
was
very
pleasant
there
on
the
side
*NL*
porch
,
where
there
were
chairs
,
a
wicker
lounge
,
and
a
small
table
.
She
*NL*
seated
herself
,
for
she
was
tired
from
her
long
tramp
;
and
she
began
to
*NL*
rock
gently
and
smooth
out
the
folds
of
her
silk
parasol
.
Victor
drew
*NL*
up
his
chair
beside
her
.
He
at
once
explained
that
the
black
woman
's
*NL*
offensive
conduct
was
all
due
to
imperfect
training
,
as
he
was
not
there
*NL*
to
take
her
in
hand
.
He
had
only
come
up
from
the
island
the
morning
*NL*
before
,
and
expected
to
return
next
day
.
He
stayed
all
winter
at
the
*NL*
island
;
he
lived
there
,
and
kept
the
place
in
order
and
got
things
ready
*NL*
for
the
summer
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
man
needed
occasional
relaxation
,
he
informed
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
and
*NL*
every
now
and
again
he
drummed
up
a
pretext
to
bring
him
to
the
city
.
*NL*
My
!
but
he
had
had
a
time
of
it
the
evening
before
!
He
would
n't
want
his
*NL*
mother
to
know
,
and
he
began
to
talk
in
a
whisper
.
He
was
scintillant
*NL*
with
recollections
.
Of
course
,
he
could
n't
think
of
telling
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
all
about
it
,
she
being
a
woman
and
not
comprehending
such
*NL*
things
.
But
it
all
began
with
a
girl
peeping
and
smiling
at
him
through
*NL*
the
shutters
as
he
passed
by
.
Oh
!
but
she
was
a
beauty
!
Certainly
he
*NL*
smiled
back
,
and
went
up
and
talked
to
her
.
Mrs.
Pontellier
did
not
know
*NL*
him
if
she
supposed
he
was
one
to
let
an
opportunity
like
that
escape
*NL*
him
.
Despite
herself
,
the
youngster
amused
her
.
She
must
have
betrayed
*NL*
in
her
look
some
degree
of
interest
or
entertainment
.
The
boy
grew
more
*NL*
daring
,
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
might
have
found
herself
,
in
a
little
while
,
*NL*
listening
to
a
highly
colored
story
but
for
the
timely
appearance
of
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
lady
was
still
clad
in
white
,
according
to
her
custom
of
the
*NL*
summer
.
Her
eyes
beamed
an
effusive
welcome
.
Would
not
Mrs.
Pontellier
*NL*
go
inside
?
Would
she
partake
of
some
refreshment
?
Why
had
she
not
been
*NL*
there
before
?
How
was
that
dear
Mr.
Pontellier
and
how
were
those
sweet
*NL*
children
?
Had
Mrs.
Pontellier
ever
known
such
a
warm
November
?
*NL*
*NL*
Victor
went
and
reclined
on
the
wicker
lounge
behind
his
mother
's
chair
,
*NL*
where
he
commanded
a
view
of
Edna
's
face
.
He
had
taken
her
parasol
from
*NL*
her
hands
while
he
spoke
to
her
,
and
he
now
lifted
it
and
twirled
it
*NL*
above
him
as
he
lay
on
his
back
.
When
Madame
Lebrun
complained
that
it
*NL*
was
so
dull
coming
back
to
the
city
;
that
she
saw
so
few
people
now
;
*NL*
that
even
Victor
,
when
he
came
up
from
the
island
for
a
day
or
two
,
had
*NL*
so
much
to
occupy
him
and
engage
his
time
;
then
it
was
that
the
youth
*NL*
went
into
contortions
on
the
lounge
and
winked
mischievously
at
Edna
.
*NL*
She
somehow
felt
like
a
confederate
in
crime
,
and
tried
to
look
severe
*NL*
and
disapproving
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
but
two
letters
from
Robert
,
with
little
in
them
,
they
*NL*
told
her
.
Victor
said
it
was
really
not
worth
while
to
go
inside
for
*NL*
the
letters
,
when
his
mother
entreated
him
to
go
in
search
of
them
.
He
*NL*
remembered
the
contents
,
which
in
truth
he
rattled
off
very
glibly
when
*NL*
put
to
the
test
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
letter
was
written
from
Vera
Cruz
and
the
other
from
the
City
*NL*
of
Mexico
.
He
had
met
Montel
,
who
was
doing
everything
toward
his
*NL*
advancement
.
So
far
,
the
financial
situation
was
no
improvement
over
the
*NL*
one
he
had
left
in
New
Orleans
,
but
of
course
the
prospects
were
vastly
*NL*
better
.
He
wrote
of
the
City
of
Mexico
,
the
buildings
,
the
people
and
*NL*
their
habits
,
the
conditions
of
life
which
he
found
there
.
He
sent
his
*NL*
love
to
the
family
.
He
inclosed
a
check
to
his
mother
,
and
hoped
she
*NL*
would
affectionately
remember
him
to
all
his
friends
.
That
was
about
the
*NL*
substance
of
the
two
letters
.
Edna
felt
that
if
there
had
been
a
message
*NL*
for
her
,
she
would
have
received
it
.
The
despondent
frame
of
mind
in
*NL*
which
she
had
left
home
began
again
to
overtake
her
,
and
she
remembered
*NL*
that
she
wished
to
find
Mademoiselle
Reisz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Lebrun
knew
where
Mademoiselle
Reisz
lived
.
She
gave
Edna
the
*NL*
address
,
regretting
that
she
would
not
consent
to
stay
and
spend
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
afternoon
,
and
pay
a
visit
to
Mademoiselle
Reisz
some
*NL*
other
day
.
The
afternoon
was
already
well
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Victor
escorted
her
out
upon
the
banquette
,
lifted
her
parasol
,
and
held
*NL*
it
over
her
while
he
walked
to
the
car
with
her
.
He
entreated
her
*NL*
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
disclosures
of
the
afternoon
were
strictly
*NL*
confidential
.
She
laughed
and
bantered
him
a
little
,
remembering
too
*NL*
late
that
she
should
have
been
dignified
and
reserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
handsome
Mrs.
Pontellier
looked
!
''
said
Madame
Lebrun
to
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ravishing
!
''
he
admitted
.
``
The
city
atmosphere
has
improved
her
.
Some
*NL*
way
she
does
n't
seem
like
the
same
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
people
contended
that
the
reason
Mademoiselle
Reisz
always
chose
*NL*
apartments
up
under
the
roof
was
to
discourage
the
approach
of
beggars
,
*NL*
peddlars
and
callers
.
There
were
plenty
of
windows
in
her
little
front
*NL*
room
.
They
were
for
the
most
part
dingy
,
but
as
they
were
nearly
always
*NL*
open
it
did
not
make
so
much
difference
.
They
often
admitted
into
the
*NL*
room
a
good
deal
of
smoke
and
soot
;
but
at
the
same
time
all
the
light
*NL*
and
air
that
there
was
came
through
them
.
From
her
windows
could
be
seen
*NL*
the
crescent
of
the
river
,
the
masts
of
ships
and
the
big
chimneys
of
*NL*
the
Mississippi
steamers
.
A
magnificent
piano
crowded
the
apartment
.
*NL*
In
the
next
room
she
slept
,
and
in
the
third
and
last
she
harbored
a
*NL*
gasoline
stove
on
which
she
cooked
her
meals
when
disinclined
to
descend
*NL*
to
the
neighboring
restaurant
.
It
was
there
also
that
she
ate
,
keeping
*NL*
her
belongings
in
a
rare
old
buffet
,
dingy
and
battered
from
a
hundred
*NL*
years
of
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Edna
knocked
at
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
front
room
door
and
entered
,
*NL*
she
discovered
that
person
standing
beside
the
window
,
engaged
in
*NL*
mending
or
patching
an
old
prunella
gaiter
.
The
little
musician
laughed
*NL*
all
over
when
she
saw
Edna
.
Her
laugh
consisted
of
a
contortion
of
the
*NL*
face
and
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
.
She
seemed
strikingly
homely
,
*NL*
standing
there
in
the
afternoon
light
.
She
still
wore
the
shabby
lace
*NL*
and
the
artificial
bunch
of
violets
on
the
side
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
remembered
me
at
last
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
.
``
I
had
said
to
*NL*
myself
,
`
Ah
,
bah
!
she
will
never
come
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
want
me
to
come
?
''
asked
Edna
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
thought
much
about
it
,
''
answered
Mademoiselle
.
The
two
had
*NL*
seated
themselves
on
a
little
bumpy
sofa
which
stood
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
however
,
that
you
came
.
I
have
the
water
boiling
back
there
,
*NL*
and
was
just
about
to
make
some
coffee
.
You
will
drink
a
cup
with
*NL*
me
.
And
how
is
la
belle
dame
?
Always
handsome
!
always
healthy
!
always
*NL*
contented
!
''
She
took
Edna
's
hand
between
her
strong
wiry
fingers
,
*NL*
holding
it
loosely
without
warmth
,
and
executing
a
sort
of
double
theme
*NL*
upon
the
back
and
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
went
on
;
``
I
sometimes
thought
:
`
She
will
never
come
.
She
*NL*
promised
as
those
women
in
society
always
do
,
without
meaning
it
.
*NL*
She
will
not
come
.
'
For
I
really
do
n't
believe
you
like
me
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
like
you
or
not
,
''
replied
Edna
,
gazing
down
at
*NL*
the
little
woman
with
a
quizzical
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candor
of
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
admission
greatly
pleased
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Reisz
.
She
expressed
her
gratification
by
repairing
forthwith
to
the
*NL*
region
of
the
gasoline
stove
and
rewarding
her
guest
with
the
promised
*NL*
cup
of
coffee
.
The
coffee
and
the
biscuit
accompanying
it
proved
very
*NL*
acceptable
to
Edna
,
who
had
declined
refreshment
at
Madame
Lebrun
's
and
*NL*
was
now
beginning
to
feel
hungry
.
Mademoiselle
set
the
tray
which
she
*NL*
brought
in
upon
a
small
table
near
at
hand
,
and
seated
herself
once
*NL*
again
on
the
lumpy
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
letter
from
your
friend
,
''
she
remarked
,
as
she
poured
a
*NL*
little
cream
into
Edna
's
cup
and
handed
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
friend
Robert
.
He
wrote
to
me
from
the
City
of
Mexico
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wrote
to
YOU
?
''
repeated
Edna
in
amazement
,
stirring
her
coffee
*NL*
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
me
.
Why
not
?
Do
n't
stir
all
the
warmth
out
of
your
coffee
;
*NL*
drink
it
.
Though
the
letter
might
as
well
have
been
sent
to
you
;
it
was
*NL*
nothing
but
Mrs.
Pontellier
from
beginning
to
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
it
,
''
requested
the
young
woman
,
entreatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
a
letter
concerns
no
one
but
the
person
who
writes
it
and
the
one
*NL*
to
whom
it
is
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
just
said
it
concerned
me
from
beginning
to
end

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
written
about
you

not
to
you

Have
you
seen
Mrs.
Pontellier

*NL*
How
is
she
looking

'
he
asks
.
`
As
Mrs.
Pontellier
says
,
'
or
`
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
once
said
.
'
`
If
Mrs.
Pontellier
should
call
upon
you
,
play
*NL*
for
her
that
Impromptu
of
Chopin

,
my
favorite
.
I
heard
it
here
a
day
*NL*
or
two
ago
,
but
not
as
you
play
it
.
I
should
like
to
know
how
it
affects
*NL*
her
,

and
so
on

supposed

were
constantly
in
each
other

*NL*
society

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

the
Impromptu

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you

nothing

What

doing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Painting

''
laughed
Edna
.
``
I
am
becoming
an

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

an

You

To

absolute

have
not
been
acquired
by

possess

``

*NL*
``
Show

You
see
that
I

persistence

Does
that
quality
count
for
anything
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
counts
with
a
foolish
old
woman
whom
you
have
captivated

''
replied
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
with
her
wriggling
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
right
there
at
hand
in
the
drawer
of
the
little
table
*NL*
upon
which
Edna
had
just
placed
her
coffee
cup
.
Mademoiselle
opened
*NL*
the
drawer
and
drew
forth
the
letter
,
the
topmost
one
.
She
placed
it
in
*NL*
Edna
's
hands
,
and
without
further
comment
arose
and
went
to
the
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
played
a
soft
interlude
.
It
was
an
improvisation
.
She
sat
*NL*
low
at
the
instrument
,
and
the
lines
of
her
body
settled
into
ungraceful
*NL*
curves
and
angles
that
gave
it
an
appearance
of
deformity
.
Gradually
and
*NL*
imperceptibly
the
interlude
melted
into
the
soft
opening
minor
chords
of
*NL*
the
Chopin
Impromptu
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
did
not
know
when
the
Impromptu
began
or
ended
.
She
sat
in
the
sofa
*NL*
corner
reading
Robert
's
letter
by
the
fading
light
.
Mademoiselle
had
*NL*
glided
from
the
Chopin
into
the
quivering
love
notes
of
Isolde
's
song
,
*NL*
and
back
again
to
the
Impromptu
with
its
soulful
and
poignant
longing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadows
deepened
in
the
little
room
.
The
music
grew
strange
and
*NL*
fantastic
--
turbulent
,
insistent
,
plaintive
and
soft
with
entreaty
.
The
*NL*
shadows
grew
deeper
.
The
music
filled
the
room
.
It
floated
out
upon
the
*NL*
night
,
over
the
housetops
,
the
crescent
of
the
river
,
losing
itself
in
*NL*
the
silence
of
the
upper
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
sobbing
,
just
as
she
had
wept
one
midnight
at
Grand
Isle
when
*NL*
strange
,
new
voices
awoke
in
her
.
She
arose
in
some
agitation
to
take
*NL*
her
departure
.
``
May
I
come
again
,
Mademoiselle
?
''
she
asked
at
the
*NL*
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
whenever
you
feel
like
it
.
Be
careful
;
the
stairs
and
landings
are
*NL*
dark
;
do
n't
stumble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
reentered
and
lit
a
candle
.
Robert
's
letter
was
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
She
stooped
and
picked
it
up
.
It
was
crumpled
and
damp
with
*NL*
tears
.
Mademoiselle
smoothed
the
letter
out
,
restored
it
to
the
*NL*
envelope
,
and
replaced
it
in
the
table
drawer
.

XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
on
his
way
into
town
Mr.
Pontellier
stopped
at
the
house
of
*NL*
his
old
friend
and
family
physician
,
Doctor
Mandelet
.
The
Doctor
was
a
*NL*
semi-retired
physician
,
resting
,
as
the
saying
is
,
upon
his
laurels
.
*NL*
He
bore
a
reputation
for
wisdom
rather
than
skill
--
leaving
the
active
*NL*
practice
of
medicine
to
his
assistants
and
younger
contemporaries
--
and
*NL*
was
much
sought
for
in
matters
of
consultation
.
A
few
families
,
united
*NL*
to
him
by
bonds
of
friendship
,
he
still
attended
when
they
required
the
*NL*
services
of
a
physician
.
The
Pontelliers
were
among
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
found
the
Doctor
reading
at
the
open
window
of
his
study
.
*NL*
His
house
stood
rather
far
back
from
the
street
,
in
the
center
of
*NL*
a
delightful
garden
,
so
that
it
was
quiet
and
peaceful
at
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
's
study
window
.
He
was
a
great
reader
.
He
stared
up
*NL*
disapprovingly
over
his
eye-glasses
as
Mr.
Pontellier
entered
,
wondering
*NL*
who
had
the
temerity
to
disturb
him
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Pontellier
!
Not
sick
,
I
hope
.
Come
and
have
a
seat
.
What
news
do
*NL*
you
bring
this
morning
?
''
He
was
quite
portly
,
with
a
profusion
of
*NL*
gray
hair
,
and
small
blue
eyes
which
age
had
robbed
of
much
of
their
*NL*
brightness
but
none
of
their
penetration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
'm
never
sick
,
Doctor
.
You
know
that
I
come
of
tough
fiber
--
of
*NL*
that
old
Creole
race
of
Pontelliers
that
dry
up
and
finally
blow
away
.
*NL*
I
came
to
consult
--
no
,
not
precisely
to
consult
--
to
talk
to
you
about
*NL*
Edna
.
I
do
n't
know
what
ails
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Pontellier
not
well
,
''
marveled
the
Doctor
.
``
Why
,
I
saw
her
--
I
*NL*
think
it
was
a
week
ago
--
walking
along
Canal
Street
,
the
picture
of
*NL*
health
,
it
seemed
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
she
seems
quite
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Pontellier
,
leaning
forward
*NL*
and
whirling
his
stick
between
his
two
hands
;
``
but
she
does
n't
act
well
.
*NL*
She
's
odd
,
she
's
not
like
herself
.
I
ca
n't
make
her
out
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
perhaps
you
'd
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
she
act
?
''
inquired
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
n't
easy
to
explain
,
''
said
Mr.
Pontellier
,
throwing
himself
*NL*
back
in
his
chair
.
``
She
lets
the
housekeeping
go
to
the
dickens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
;
women
are
not
all
alike
,
my
dear
Pontellier
.
We
've
got
to
*NL*
consider
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
;
I
told
you
I
could
n't
explain
.
Her
whole
attitude
--
toward
*NL*
me
and
everybody
and
everything
--
has
changed
.
You
know
I
have
a
quick
*NL*
temper
,
but
I
do
n't
want
to
quarrel
or
be
rude
to
a
woman
,
especially
my
*NL*
wife
;
yet
I
'm
driven
to
it
,
and
feel
like
ten
thousand
devils
after
I
've
*NL*
made
a
fool
of
myself
.
She
's
making
it
devilishly
uncomfortable
for
*NL*
me
,
''
he
went
on
nervously
.
``
She
's
got
some
sort
of
notion
in
her
head
*NL*
concerning
the
eternal
rights
of
women
;
and
--
you
understand
--
we
meet
in
*NL*
the
morning
at
the
breakfast
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
lifted
his
shaggy
eyebrows
,
protruded
his
thick
nether
*NL*
lip
,
and
tapped
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
cushioned
fingertips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
to
her
,
Pontellier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doing
!
Parbleu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
,
''
asked
the
Doctor
,
with
a
smile
,
``
has
she
been
associating
*NL*
of
late
with
a
circle
of
pseudo-intellectual
women
--
super-spiritual
*NL*
superior
beings
?
My
wife
has
been
telling
me
about
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
trouble
,
''
broke
in
Mr.
Pontellier
,
``
she
has
n't
been
*NL*
associating
with
any
one
.
She
has
abandoned
her
Tuesdays
at
home
,
has
*NL*
thrown
over
all
her
acquaintances
,
and
goes
tramping
about
by
herself
,
*NL*
moping
in
the
street-cars
,
getting
in
after
dark
.
I
tell
you
she
's
*NL*
peculiar
.
I
do
n't
like
it
;
I
feel
a
little
worried
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
new
aspect
for
the
Doctor
.
``
Nothing
hereditary
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
seriously
.
``
Nothing
peculiar
about
her
family
antecedents
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
indeed
!
She
comes
of
sound
old
Presbyterian
Kentucky
stock
.
The
*NL*
old
gentleman
,
her
father
,
I
have
heard
,
used
to
atone
for
his
weekday
*NL*
sins
with
his
Sunday
devotions
.
I
know
for
a
fact
,
that
his
race
horses
*NL*
literally
ran
away
with
the
prettiest
bit
of
Kentucky
farming
land
*NL*
I
ever
laid
eyes
upon
.
Margaret
--
you
know
Margaret
--
she
has
all
the
*NL*
Presbyterianism
undiluted
.
And
the
youngest
is
something
of
a
vixen
.
By
*NL*
the
way
,
she
gets
married
in
a
couple
of
weeks
from
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
your
wife
up
to
the
wedding
,
''
exclaimed
the
Doctor
,
foreseeing
a
*NL*
happy
solution
.
``
Let
her
stay
among
her
own
people
for
a
while
;
it
will
*NL*
do
her
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
want
her
to
do
.
She
wo
n't
go
to
the
marriage
.
She
says
*NL*
a
wedding
is
one
of
the
most
lamentable
spectacles
on
earth
.
Nice
thing
*NL*
for
a
woman
to
say
to
her
husband
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Pontellier
,
fuming
*NL*
anew
at
the
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pontellier
,
''
said
the
Doctor
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
``
let
your
*NL*
wife
alone
for
a
while
.
Do
n't
bother
her
,
and
do
n't
let
her
bother
*NL*
you
.
Woman
,
my
dear
friend
,
is
a
very
peculiar
and
delicate
organism
--
a
*NL*
sensitive
and
highly
organized
woman
,
such
as
I
know
Mrs.
Pontellier
to
*NL*
be
,
is
especially
peculiar
.
It
would
require
an
inspired
psychologist
to
*NL*
deal
successfully
with
them
.
And
when
ordinary
fellows
like
you
and
me
*NL*
attempt
to
cope
with
their
idiosyncrasies
the
result
is
bungling
.
Most
*NL*
women
are
moody
and
whimsical
.
This
is
some
passing
whim
of
your
wife
,
*NL*
due
to
some
cause
or
causes
which
you
and
I
need
n't
try
to
fathom
.
But
*NL*
it
will
pass
happily
over
,
especially
if
you
let
her
alone
.
Send
her
*NL*
around
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
could
n't
do
that
;
there
'd
be
no
reason
for
it
,
''
objected
Mr.
*NL*
Pontellier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
go
around
and
see
her
,
''
said
the
Doctor
.
``
I
'll
drop
in
to
*NL*
dinner
some
evening
en
bon
ami
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
!
by
all
means
,
''
urged
Mr.
Pontellier
.
``
What
evening
will
you
come
?
*NL*
Say
Thursday
.
Will
you
come
Thursday
?
''
he
asked
,
rising
to
take
his
*NL*
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
Thursday
.
My
wife
may
possibly
have
some
engagement
for
*NL*
me
Thursday
.
In
case
she
has
,
I
shall
let
you
know
.
Otherwise
,
you
may
*NL*
expect
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
turned
before
leaving
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
New
York
on
business
very
soon
.
I
have
a
big
scheme
on
*NL*
hand
,
and
want
to
be
on
the
field
proper
to
pull
the
ropes
and
handle
*NL*
the
ribbons
.
We
'll
let
you
in
on
the
inside
if
you
say
so
,
Doctor
,
''
he
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
thank
you
,
my
dear
sir
,
''
returned
the
Doctor
.
``
I
leave
such
*NL*
ventures
to
you
younger
men
with
the
fever
of
life
still
in
your
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
wanted
to
say
,
''
continued
Mr.
Pontellier
,
with
his
hand
on
the
*NL*
knob
;
``
I
may
have
to
be
absent
a
good
while
.
Would
you
advise
me
to
take
*NL*
Edna
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
all

,
if
she
wishes
to
go
.
If
not
,
leave
her
here
.
Do
n't
*NL*
contradict
her
.
The
mood
will
pass
,
I
assure
you
.
It
may
take
a
month
,
*NL*
two
,
three
months
--
possibly
longer
,
but
it
will
pass
;
have
patience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-by
,
a
jeudi
,
''
said
Mr.
Pontellier
,
as
he
let
himself
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
would
have
liked
during
the
course
of
conversation
to
ask
,
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
man
in
the
case
?
''
but
he
knew
his
Creole
too
well
to
make
*NL*
such
a
blunder
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
resume
his
book
immediately
,
but
sat
for
a
while
meditatively
*NL*
looking
out
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
's
father
was
in
the
city
,
and
had
been
with
them
several
days
.
*NL*
She
was
not
very
warmly
or
deeply
attached
to
him
,
but
they
had
certain
*NL*
tastes
in
common
,
and
when
together
they
were
companionable
.
His
coming
*NL*
was
in
the
nature
of
a
welcome
disturbance
;
it
seemed
to
furnish
a
new
*NL*
direction
for
her
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
to
purchase
a
wedding
gift
for
his
daughter
,
Janet
,
and
an
*NL*
outfit
for
himself
in
which
he
might
make
a
creditable
appearance
at
*NL*
her
marriage
.
Mr.
Pontellier
had
selected
the
bridal
gift
,
as
every
*NL*
one
immediately
connected
with
him
always
deferred
to
his
taste
in
such
*NL*
matters
.
And
his
suggestions
on
the
question
of
dress
--
which
too
*NL*
often
assumes
the
nature
of
a
problem
--
were
of
inestimable
value
to
his
*NL*
father-in-law
.
But
for
the
past
few
days
the
old
gentleman
had
been
upon
*NL*
Edna
's
hands
,
and
in
his
society
she
was
becoming
acquainted
with
a
new
*NL*
set
of
sensations
.
He
had
been
a
colonel
in
the
Confederate
army
,
and
*NL*
still
maintained
,
with
the
title
,
the
military
bearing
which
had
always
*NL*
accompanied
it
.
His
hair
and
mustache
were
white
and
silky
,
emphasizing
*NL*
the
rugged
bronze
of
his
face
.
He
was
tall
and
thin
,
and
wore
his
coats
*NL*
padded
,
which
gave
a
fictitious
breadth
and
depth
to
his
shoulders
*NL*
and
chest
.
Edna
and
her
father
looked
very
distinguished
together
,
and
*NL*
excited
a
good
deal
of
notice
during
their
perambulations
.
Upon
his
*NL*
arrival
she
began
by
introducing
him
to
her
atelier
and
making
a
sketch
*NL*
of
him
.
He
took
the
whole
matter
very
seriously
.
If
her
talent
had
been
*NL*
ten-fold
greater
than
it
was
,
it
would
not
have
surprised
him
,
convinced
*NL*
as
he
was
that
he
had
bequeathed
to
all
of
his
daughters
the
germs
of
a
*NL*
masterful
capability
,
which
only
depended
upon
their
own
efforts
to
be
*NL*
directed
toward
successful
achievement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
her
pencil
he
sat
rigid
and
unflinching
,
as
he
had
faced
the
*NL*
cannon
's
mouth
in
days
gone
by
.
He
resented
the
intrusion
of
the
*NL*
children
,
who
gaped
with
wondering
eyes
at
him
,
sitting
so
stiff
up
*NL*
there
in
their
mother
's
bright
atelier
.
When
they
drew
near
he
motioned
*NL*
them
away
with
an
expressive
action
of
the
foot
,
loath
to
disturb
the
*NL*
fixed
lines
of
his
countenance
,
his
arms
,
or
his
rigid
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
,
anxious
to
entertain
him
,
invited
Mademoiselle
Reisz
to
meet
*NL*
him
,
having
promised
him
a
treat
in
her
piano
playing
;
but
Mademoiselle
*NL*
declined
the
invitation
.
So
together
they
attended
a
soiree
musicale
*NL*
at
the
Ratignolles
'
.
Monsieur
and
Madame
Ratignolle
made
much
of
the
*NL*
Colonel
,
installing
him
as
the
guest
of
honor
and
engaging
him
at
*NL*
once
to
dine
with
them
the
following
Sunday
,
or
any
day
which
he
might
*NL*
select
.
Madame
coquetted
with
him
in
the
most
captivating
and
naive
*NL*
manner
,
with
eyes
,
gestures
,
and
a
profusion
of
compliments
,
till
the
*NL*
Colonel
's
old
head
felt
thirty
years
younger
on
his
padded
shoulders
.
*NL*
Edna
marveled
,
not
comprehending
.
She
herself
was
almost
devoid
of
*NL*
coquetry
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
one
or
two
men
whom
she
observed
at
the
soiree
musicale
;
*NL*
but
she
would
never
have
felt
moved
to
any
kittenish
display
to
attract
*NL*
their
notice
--
to
any
feline
or
feminine
wiles
to
express
herself
toward
*NL*
them
.
Their
personality
attracted
her
in
an
agreeable
way
.
Her
fancy
*NL*
selected
them
,
and
she
was
glad
when
a
lull
in
the
music
gave
them
*NL*
an
opportunity
to
meet
her
and
talk
with
her
.
Often
on
the
street
the
*NL*
glance
of
strange
eyes
had
lingered
in
her
memory
,
and
sometimes
had
*NL*
disturbed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
did
not
attend
these
soirees
musicales
.
He
considered
*NL*
them
bourgeois
,
and
found
more
diversion
at
the
club
.
To
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
he
said
the
music
dispensed
at
her
soirees
was
too
``
heavy
,
''
*NL*
too
far
beyond
his
untrained
comprehension
.
His
excuse
flattered
her
.
*NL*
But
she
disapproved
of
Mr.
Pontellier
's
club
,
and
she
was
frank
enough
*NL*
to
tell
Edna
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
Mr.
Pontellier
does
n't
stay
home
more
in
the
evenings
.
*NL*
I
think
you
would
be
more
--
well
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
my
saying
it
--
more
*NL*
united
,
if
he
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
dear
no
!
''
said
Edna
,
with
a
blank
look
in
her
eyes
.
``
What
should
I
*NL*
do
if
he
stayed
home
?
We
would
n't
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
much
of
anything
to
say
to
her
father
,
for
that
matter
;
but
*NL*
he
did
not
antagonize
her
.
She
discovered
that
he
interested
her
,
though
*NL*
she
realized
that
he
might
not
interest
her
long
;
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
in
her
life
she
felt
as
if
she
were
thoroughly
acquainted
with
him
.
He
*NL*
kept
her
busy
serving
him
and
ministering
to
his
wants
.
It
amused
her
*NL*
to
do
so
.
She
would
not
permit
a
servant
or
one
of
the
children
to
do
*NL*
anything
for
him
which
she
might
do
herself
.
Her
husband
noticed
,
and
*NL*
thought
it
was
the
expression
of
a
deep
filial
attachment
which
he
had
*NL*
never
suspected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Colonel
drank
numerous
``
toddies
''
during
the
course
of
the
day
,
which
*NL*
left
him
,
however
,
imperturbed
.
He
was
an
expert
at
concocting
strong
*NL*
drinks
.
He
had
even
invented
some
,
to
which
he
had
given
fantastic
*NL*
names
,
and
for
whose
manufacture
he
required
diverse
ingredients
that
it
*NL*
devolved
upon
Edna
to
procure
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Doctor
Mandelet
dined
with
the
Pontelliers
on
Thursday
he
could
*NL*
discern
in
Mrs.
Pontellier
no
trace
of
that
morbid
condition
which
her
*NL*
husband
had
reported
to
him
.
She
was
excited
and
in
a
manner
radiant
.
*NL*
She
and
her
father
had
been
to
the
race
course
,
and
their
thoughts
when
*NL*
they
seated
themselves
at
table
were
still
occupied
with
the
events
of
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
and
their
talk
was
still
of
the
track
.
The
Doctor
had
not
*NL*
kept
pace
with
turf
affairs
.
He
had
certain
recollections
of
racing
*NL*
in
what
he
called
``
the
good
old
times
''
when
the
Lecompte
stables
*NL*
flourished
,
and
he
drew
upon
this
fund
of
memories
so
that
he
might
not
*NL*
be
left
out
and
seem
wholly
devoid
of
the
modern
spirit
.
But
he
failed
*NL*
to
impose
upon
the
Colonel
,
and
was
even
far
from
impressing
him
with
*NL*
this
trumped-up
knowledge
of
bygone
days
.
Edna
had
staked
her
father
*NL*
on
his
last
venture
,
with
the
most
gratifying
results
to
both
of
them
.
*NL*
Besides
,
they
had
met
some
very
charming
people
,
according
to
the
*NL*
Colonel
's
impressions
.
Mrs.
Mortimer
Merriman
and
Mrs.
James
Highcamp
,
*NL*
who
were
there
with
Alcee
Arobin
,
had
joined
them
and
had
enlivened
the
*NL*
hours
in
a
fashion
that
warmed
him
to
think
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
himself
had
no
particular
leaning
toward
horseracing
,
and
*NL*
was
even
rather
inclined
to
discourage
it
as
a
pastime
,
especially
*NL*
when
he
considered
the
fate
of
that
blue-grass
farm
in
Kentucky
.
He
*NL*
endeavored
,
in
a
general
way
,
to
express
a
particular
disapproval
,
and
*NL*
only
succeeded
in
arousing
the
ire
and
opposition
of
his
father-in-law
.
*NL*
A
pretty
dispute
followed
,
in
which
Edna
warmly
espoused
her
father
's
*NL*
cause
and
the
Doctor
remained
neutral
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
observed
his
hostess
attentively
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
,
and
*NL*
noted
a
subtle
change
which
had
transformed
her
from
the
listless
woman
*NL*
he
had
known
into
a
being
who
,
for
the
moment
,
seemed
palpitant
with
*NL*
the
forces
of
life
.
Her
speech
was
warm
and
energetic
.
There
was
no
*NL*
repression
in
her
glance
or
gesture
.
She
reminded
him
of
some
beautiful
,
*NL*
sleek
animal
waking
up
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
excellent
.
The
claret
was
warm
and
the
champagne
was
*NL*
cold
,
and
under
their
beneficent
influence
the
threatened
unpleasantness
*NL*
melted
and
vanished
with
the
fumes
of
the
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
warmed
up
and
grew
reminiscent
.
He
told
some
amusing
*NL*
plantation
experiences
,
recollections
of
old
Iberville
and
his
youth
,
*NL*
when
he
hunted
`
possum
in
company
with
some
friendly
darky
;
thrashed
*NL*
the
pecan
trees
,
shot
the
grosbec
,
and
roamed
the
woods
and
fields
in
*NL*
mischievous
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Colonel
,
with
little
sense
of
humor
and
of
the
fitness
of
things
,
*NL*
related
a
somber
episode
of
those
dark
and
bitter
days
,
in
which
he
had
*NL*
acted
a
conspicuous
part
and
always
formed
a
central
figure
.
Nor
was
*NL*
the
Doctor
happier
in
his
selection
,
when
he
told
the
old
,
ever
new
*NL*
and
curious
story
of
the
waning
of
a
woman
's
love
,
seeking
strange
,
new
*NL*
channels
,
only
to
return
to
its
legitimate
source
after
days
of
fierce
*NL*
unrest
.
It
was
one
of
the
many
little
human
documents
which
had
been
*NL*
unfolded
to
him
during
his
long
career
as
a
physician
.
The
story
did
not
*NL*
seem
especially
to
impress
Edna
.
She
had
one
of
her
own
to
tell
,
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
paddled
away
with
her
lover
one
night
in
a
pirogue
and
never
*NL*
came
back
.
They
were
lost
amid
the
Baratarian
Islands
,
and
no
one
ever
*NL*
heard
of
them
or
found
trace
of
them
from
that
day
to
this
.
It
was
a
*NL*
pure
invention
.
She
said
that
Madame
Antoine
had
related
it
to
her
.
*NL*
That
,
also
,
was
an
invention
.
Perhaps
it
was
a
dream
she
had
had
.
But
*NL*
every
glowing
word
seemed
real
to
those
who
listened
.
They
could
feel
*NL*
the
hot
breath
of
the
Southern
night
;
they
could
hear
the
long
sweep
of
*NL*
the
pirogue
through
the
glistening
moonlit
water
,
the
beating
of
birds
'
*NL*
wings
,
rising
startled
from
among
the
reeds
in
the
salt-water
pools
;
*NL*
they
could
see
the
faces
of
the
lovers
,
pale
,
close
together
,
rapt
in
*NL*
oblivious
forgetfulness
,
drifting
into
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
champagne
was
cold
,
and
its
subtle
fumes
played
fantastic
tricks
*NL*
with
Edna
's
memory
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
,
away
from
the
glow
of
the
fire
and
the
soft
lamplight
,
the
*NL*
night
was
chill
and
murky
.
The
Doctor
doubled
his
old-fashioned
cloak
*NL*
across
his
breast
as
he
strode
home
through
the
darkness
.
He
knew
his
*NL*
fellow-creatures
better
than
most
men
;
knew
that
inner
life
which
so
*NL*
seldom
unfolds
itself
to
unanointed
eyes
.
He
was
sorry
he
had
accepted
*NL*
Pontellier
's
invitation
.
He
was
growing
old
,
and
beginning
to
need
rest
*NL*
and
an
imperturbed
spirit
.
He
did
not
want
the
secrets
of
other
lives
*NL*
thrust
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
is
n't
Arobin
,
''
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
walked
.
``
I
hope
*NL*
to
heaven
it
is
n't
Alcee
Arobin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
and
her
father
had
a
warm
,
and
almost
violent
dispute
upon
the
*NL*
subject
of
her
refusal
to
attend
her
sister
's
wedding
.
Mr.
Pontellier
*NL*
declined
to
interfere
,
to
interpose
either
his
influence
or
his
*NL*
authority
.
He
was
following
Doctor
Mandelet
's
advice
,
and
letting
her
do
*NL*
as
she
liked
.
The
Colonel
reproached
his
daughter
for
her
lack
of
*NL*
filial
kindness
and
respect
,
her
want
of
sisterly
affection
and
womanly
*NL*
consideration
.
His
arguments
were
labored
and
unconvincing
.
He
doubted
*NL*
if
Janet
would
accept
any
excuse
--
forgetting
that
Edna
had
offered
*NL*
none
.
He
doubted
if
Janet
would
ever
speak
to
her
again
,
and
he
was
sure
*NL*
Margaret
would
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
father
when
he
finally
took
himself
*NL*
off
with
his
wedding
garments
and
his
bridal
gifts
,
with
his
padded
*NL*
shoulders
,
his
Bible
reading
,
his
``
toddies
''
and
ponderous
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
followed
him
closely
.
He
meant
to
stop
at
the
wedding
*NL*
on
his
way
to
New
York
and
endeavor
by
every
means
which
money
and
love
*NL*
could
devise
to
atone
somewhat
for
Edna
's
incomprehensible
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
too
lenient
,
too
lenient
by
far
,
Leonce
,
''
asserted
the
Colonel
.
*NL*
``
Authority
,
coercion
are
what
is
needed
.
Put
your
foot
down
good
and
*NL*
hard
;
the
only
way
to
manage
a
wife
.
Take
my
word
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Colonel
was
perhaps
unaware
that
he
had
coerced
his
own
wife
into
*NL*
her
grave
.
Mr.
Pontellier
had
a
vague
suspicion
of
it
which
he
thought
*NL*
it
needless
to
mention
at
that
late
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
not
so
consciously
gratified
at
her
husband
's
leaving
home
as
*NL*
she
had
been
over
the
departure
of
her
father
.
As
the
day
approached
*NL*
when
he
was
to
leave
her
for
a
comparatively
long
stay
,
she
grew
melting
*NL*
and
affectionate
,
remembering
his
many
acts
of
consideration
and
his
*NL*
repeated
expressions
of
an
ardent
attachment
.
She
was
solicitous
about
*NL*
his
health
and
his
welfare
.
She
bustled
around
,
looking
after
his
*NL*
clothing
,
thinking
about
heavy
underwear
,
quite
as
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
would
have
done
under
similar
circumstances
.
She
cried
when
he
went
*NL*
away
,
calling
him
her
dear
,
good
friend
,
and
she
was
quite
certain
she
*NL*
would
grow
lonely
before
very
long
and
go
to
join
him
in
New
York
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
all
,
a
radiant
peace
settled
upon
her
when
she
at
last
found
*NL*
herself
alone
.
Even
the
children
were
gone
.
Old
Madame
Pontellier
had
*NL*
come
herself
and
carried
them
off
to
Iberville
with
their
quadroon
.
The
*NL*
old
madame
did
not
venture
to
say
she
was
afraid
they
would
be
neglected
*NL*
during
Leonce
's
absence
;
she
hardly
ventured
to
think
so
.
She
was
hungry
*NL*
for
them
--
even
a
little
fierce
in
her
attachment
.
She
did
not
want
them
*NL*
to
be
wholly
``
children
of
the
pavement
,
''
she
always
said
when
begging
*NL*
to
have
them
for
a
space
.
She
wished
them
to
know
the
country
,
with
its
*NL*
streams
,
its
fields
,
its
woods
,
its
freedom
,
so
delicious
to
the
young
.
*NL*
She
wished
them
to
taste
something
of
the
life
their
father
had
lived
*NL*
and
known
and
loved
when
he
,
too
,
was
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Edna
was
at
last
alone
,
she
breathed
a
big
,
genuine
sigh
of
relief
.
*NL*
A
feeling
that
was
unfamiliar
but
very
delicious
came
over
her
.
She
*NL*
walked
all
through
the
house
,
from
one
room
to
another
,
as
if
inspecting
*NL*
it
for
the
first
time
.
She
tried
the
various
chairs
and
lounges
,
as
if
*NL*
she
had
never
sat
and
reclined
upon
them
before
.
And
she
perambulated
*NL*
around
the
outside
of
the
house
,
investigating
,
looking
to
see
if
*NL*
windows
and
shutters
were
secure
and
in
order
.
The
flowers
were
like
*NL*
new
acquaintances
;
she
approached
them
in
a
familiar
spirit
,
and
made
*NL*
herself
at
home
among
them
.
The
garden
walks
were
damp
,
and
Edna
called
*NL*
to
the
maid
to
bring
out
her
rubber
sandals
.
And
there
she
stayed
,
and
*NL*
stooped
,
digging
around
the
plants
,
trimming
,
picking
dead
,
dry
leaves
.
*NL*
The
children
's
little
dog
came
out
,
interfering
,
getting
in
her
way
.
She
*NL*
scolded
him
,
laughed
at
him
,
played
with
him
.
The
garden
smelled
so
good
*NL*
and
looked
so
pretty
in
the
afternoon
sunlight
.
Edna
plucked
all
the
*NL*
bright
flowers
she
could
find
,
and
went
into
the
house
with
them
,
she
*NL*
and
the
little
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
kitchen
assumed
a
sudden
interesting
character
which
she
had
*NL*
never
before
perceived
.
She
went
in
to
give
directions
to
the
cook
,
to
*NL*
say
that
the
butcher
would
have
to
bring
much
less
meat
,
that
they
would
*NL*
require
only
half
their
usual
quantity
of
bread
,
of
milk
and
groceries
.
*NL*
She
told
the
cook
that
she
herself
would
be
greatly
occupied
during
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
's
absence
,
and
she
begged
her
to
take
all
thought
and
*NL*
responsibility
of
the
larder
upon
her
own
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Edna
dined
alone
.
The
candelabra
,
with
a
few
candles
in
the
*NL*
center
of
the
table
,
gave
all
the
light
she
needed
.
Outside
the
circle
*NL*
of
light
in
which
she
sat
,
the
large
dining-room
looked
solemn
and
*NL*
shadowy
.
The
cook
,
placed
upon
her
mettle
,
served
a
delicious
repast
--
a
*NL*
luscious
tenderloin
broiled
a
point
.
The
wine
tasted
good
;
the
marron
*NL*
glace
seemed
to
be
just
what
she
wanted
.
It
was
so
pleasant
,
too
,
to
*NL*
dine
in
a
comfortable
peignoir
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
little
sentimentally
about
Leonce
and
the
children
,
and
*NL*
wondered
what
they
were
doing
.
As
she
gave
a
dainty
scrap
or
two
to
the
*NL*
doggie
,
she
talked
intimately
to
him
about
Etienne
and
Raoul
.
He
was
*NL*
beside
himself
with
astonishment
and
delight
over
these
companionable
*NL*
advances
,
and
showed
his
appreciation
by
his
little
quick
,
snappy
barks
*NL*
and
a
lively
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Edna
sat
in
the
library
after
dinner
and
read
Emerson
until
she
*NL*
grew
sleepy
.
She
realized
that
she
had
neglected
her
reading
,
and
*NL*
determined
to
start
anew
upon
a
course
of
improving
studies
,
now
that
*NL*
her
time
was
completely
her
own
to
do
with
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
refreshing
bath
,
Edna
went
to
bed
.
And
as
she
snuggled
*NL*
comfortably
beneath
the
eiderdown
a
sense
of
restfulness
invaded
her
,
*NL*
such
as
she
had
not
known
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
weather
was
dark
and
cloudy
Edna
could
not
work
.
She
needed
the
*NL*
sun
to
mellow
and
temper
her
mood
to
the
sticking
point
.
She
had
reached
*NL*
a
stage
when
she
seemed
to
be
no
longer
feeling
her
way
,
working
,
when
*NL*
in
the
humor
,
with
sureness
and
ease
.
And
being
devoid
of
ambition
,
and
*NL*
striving
not
toward
accomplishment
,
she
drew
satisfaction
from
the
work
*NL*
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
rainy
or
melancholy
days
Edna
went
out
and
sought
the
society
of
*NL*
the
friends
she
had
made
at
Grand
Isle
.
Or
else
she
stayed
indoors
*NL*
and
nursed
a
mood
with
which
she
was
becoming
too
familiar
for
her
own
*NL*
comfort
and
peace
of
mind
.
It
was
not
despair
;
but
it
seemed
to
her
as
*NL*
if
life
were
passing
by
,
leaving
its
promise
broken
and
unfulfilled
.
*NL*
Yet
there
were
other
days
when
she
listened
,
was
led
on
and
deceived
by
*NL*
fresh
promises
which
her
youth
held
out
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
again
to
the
races
,
and
again
.
Alcee
Arobin
and
Mrs.
Highcamp
*NL*
called
for
her
one
bright
afternoon
in
Arobin
's
drag
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
*NL*
a
worldly
but
unaffected
,
intelligent
,
slim
,
tall
blonde
woman
in
the
*NL*
forties
,
with
an
indifferent
manner
and
blue
eyes
that
stared
.
She
had
*NL*
a
daughter
who
served
her
as
a
pretext
for
cultivating
the
society
of
*NL*
young
men
of
fashion
.
Alcee
Arobin
was
one
of
them
.
He
was
a
familiar
*NL*
figure
at
the
race
course
,
the
opera
,
the
fashionable
clubs
.
There
was
*NL*
a
perpetual
smile
in
his
eyes
,
which
seldom
failed
to
awaken
a
*NL*
corresponding
cheerfulness
in
any
one
who
looked
into
them
and
listened
*NL*
to
his
good-humored
voice
.
His
manner
was
quiet
,
and
at
times
a
little
*NL*
insolent
.
He
possessed
a
good
figure
,
a
pleasing
face
,
not
overburdened
*NL*
with
depth
of
thought
or
feeling
;
and
his
dress
was
that
of
the
*NL*
conventional
man
of
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
admired
Edna
extravagantly
,
after
meeting
her
at
the
races
with
her
*NL*
father
.
He
had
met
her
before
on
other
occasions
,
but
she
had
seemed
to
*NL*
him
unapproachable
until
that
day
.
It
was
at
his
instigation
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Highcamp
called
to
ask
her
to
go
with
them
to
the
Jockey
Club
to
witness
*NL*
the
turf
event
of
the
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
possibly
a
few
track
men
out
there
who
knew
the
race
horse
as
*NL*
well
as
Edna
,
but
there
was
certainly
none
who
knew
it
better
.
She
sat
*NL*
between
her
two
companions
as
one
having
authority
to
speak
.
She
laughed
*NL*
at
Arobin
's
pretensions
,
and
deplored
Mrs.
Highcamp
's
ignorance
.
The
*NL*
race
horse
was
a
friend
and
intimate
associate
of
her
childhood
.
The
*NL*
atmosphere
of
the
stables
and
the
breath
of
the
blue
grass
paddock
*NL*
revived
in
her
memory
and
lingered
in
her
nostrils
.
She
did
not
perceive
*NL*
that
she
was
talking
like
her
father
as
the
sleek
geldings
ambled
in
*NL*
review
before
them
.
She
played
for
very
high
stakes
,
and
fortune
favored
*NL*
her
.
The
fever
of
the
game
flamed
in
her
cheeks
and
eyes
,
and
it
got
*NL*
into
her
blood
and
into
her
brain
like
an
intoxicant
.
People
turned
*NL*
their
heads
to
look
at
her
,
and
more
than
one
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
*NL*
her
utterances
,
hoping
thereby
to
secure
the
elusive
but
ever-desired
*NL*
``
tip
.
''
Arobin
caught
the
contagion
of
excitement
which
drew
him
to
*NL*
Edna
like
a
magnet
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
remained
,
as
usual
,
unmoved
,
with
her
*NL*
indifferent
stare
and
uplifted
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
stayed
and
dined
with
Mrs.
Highcamp
upon
being
urged
to
do
so
.
*NL*
Arobin
also
remained
and
sent
away
his
drag
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
quiet
and
uninteresting
,
save
for
the
cheerful
efforts
*NL*
of
Arobin
to
enliven
things
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
deplored
the
absence
of
her
*NL*
daughter
from
the
races
,
and
tried
to
convey
to
her
what
she
had
missed
*NL*
by
going
to
the
``
Dante
reading
''
instead
of
joining
them
.
The
girl
held
*NL*
a
geranium
leaf
up
to
her
nose
and
said
nothing
,
but
looked
knowing
and
*NL*
noncommittal
.
Mr.
Highcamp
was
a
plain
,
bald-headed
man
,
who
only
*NL*
talked
under
compulsion
.
He
was
unresponsive
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
full
of
*NL*
delicate
courtesy
and
consideration
toward
her
husband
.
She
addressed
*NL*
most
of
her
conversation
to
him
at
table
.
They
sat
in
the
library
after
*NL*
dinner
and
read
the
evening
papers
together
under
the
droplight
;
while
*NL*
the
younger
people
went
into
the
drawing-room
near
by
and
talked
.
Miss
*NL*
Highcamp
played
some
selections
from
Grieg
upon
the
piano
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
have
apprehended
all
of
the
composer
's
coldness
and
none
of
his
poetry
.
*NL*
While
Edna
listened
she
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
had
lost
her
*NL*
taste
for
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
time
came
for
her
to
go
home
,
Mr.
Highcamp
grunted
a
lame
offer
*NL*
to
escort
her
,
looking
down
at
his
slippered
feet
with
tactless
concern
.
*NL*
It
was
Arobin
who
took
her
home
.
The
car
ride
was
long
,
and
it
was
late
*NL*
when
they
reached
Esplanade
Street
.
Arobin
asked
permission
to
enter
for
*NL*
a
second
to
light
his
cigarette
--
his
match
safe
was
empty
.
He
filled
his
*NL*
match
safe
,
but
did
not
light
his
cigarette
until
he
left
her
,
after
she
*NL*
had
expressed
her
willingness
to
go
to
the
races
with
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
neither
tired
nor
sleepy
.
She
was
hungry
again
,
for
the
*NL*
Highcamp
dinner
,
though
of
excellent
quality
,
had
lacked
abundance
.
She
*NL*
rummaged
in
the
larder
and
brought
forth
a
slice
of
Gruyere
and
some
*NL*
crackers
.
She
opened
a
bottle
of
beer
which
she
found
in
the
icebox
.
*NL*
Edna
felt
extremely
restless
and
excited
.
She
vacantly
hummed
a
*NL*
fantastic
tune
as
she
poked
at
the
wood
embers
on
the
hearth
and
munched
*NL*
a
cracker
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
something
to
happen
--
something
,
anything
;
she
did
not
know
*NL*
what
.
She
regretted
that
she
had
not
made
Arobin
stay
a
half
hour
to
*NL*
talk
over
the
horses
with
her
.
She
counted
the
money
she
had
won
.
But
*NL*
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
,
so
she
went
to
bed
,
and
tossed
there
for
*NL*
hours
in
a
sort
of
monotonous
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
night
she
remembered
that
she
had
forgotten
to
*NL*
write
her
regular
letter
to
her
husband
;
and
she
decided
to
do
so
next
*NL*
day
and
tell
him
about
her
afternoon
at
the
Jockey
Club
.
She
lay
wide
*NL*
awake
composing
a
letter
which
was
nothing
like
the
one
which
she
wrote
*NL*
next
day
.
When
the
maid
awoke
her
in
the
morning
Edna
was
dreaming
of
*NL*
Mr.
Highcamp
playing
the
piano
at
the
entrance
of
a
music
store
on
Canal
*NL*
Street
,
while
his
wife
was
saying
to
Alcee
Arobin
,
as
they
boarded
an
*NL*
Esplanade
Street
car
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
that
so
much
talent
has
been
neglected
!
but
I
must
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
a
few
days
later
,
Alcee
Arobin
again
called
for
Edna
in
his
drag
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
not
with
him
.
He
said
they
would
pick
her
up
.
But
as
*NL*
that
lady
had
not
been
apprised
of
his
intention
of
picking
her
up
,
she
*NL*
was
not
at
home
.
The
daughter
was
just
leaving
the
house
to
attend
the
*NL*
meeting
of
a
branch
Folk
Lore
Society
,
and
regretted
that
she
could
not
*NL*
accompany
them
.
Arobin
appeared
nonplused
,
and
asked
Edna
if
there
were
*NL*
any
one
else
she
cared
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
deem
it
worth
while
to
go
in
search
of
any
of
the
*NL*
fashionable
acquaintances
from
whom
she
had
withdrawn
herself
.
She
*NL*
thought
of
Madame
Ratignolle
,
but
knew
that
her
fair
friend
did
not
*NL*
leave
the
house
,
except
to
take
a
languid
walk
around
the
block
with
her
*NL*
husband
after
nightfall
.
Mademoiselle
Reisz
would
have
laughed
at
such
a
*NL*
request
from
Edna
.
Madame
Lebrun
might
have
enjoyed
the
outing
,
but
for
*NL*
some
reason
Edna
did
not
want
her
.
So
they
went
alone
,
she
and
Arobin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
intensely
interesting
to
her
.
The
excitement
came
*NL*
back
upon
her
like
a
remittent
fever
.
Her
talk
grew
familiar
and
*NL*
confidential
.
It
was
no
labor
to
become
intimate
with
Arobin
.
His
manner
*NL*
invited
easy
confidence
.
The
preliminary
stage
of
becoming
acquainted
*NL*
was
one
which
he
always
endeavored
to
ignore
when
a
pretty
and
engaging
*NL*
woman
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stayed
and
dined
with
Edna
.
He
stayed
and
sat
beside
the
wood
fire
.
*NL*
They
laughed
and
talked
;
and
before
it
was
time
to
go
he
was
telling
*NL*
her
how
different
life
might
have
been
if
he
had
known
her
years
before
.
*NL*
With
ingenuous
frankness
he
spoke
of
what
a
wicked
,
ill-disciplined
boy
*NL*
he
had
been
,
and
impulsively
drew
up
his
cuff
to
exhibit
upon
his
wrist
*NL*
the
scar
from
a
saber
cut
which
he
had
received
in
a
duel
outside
of
*NL*
Paris
when
he
was
nineteen
.
She
touched
his
hand
as
she
scanned
the
red
*NL*
cicatrice
on
the
inside
of
his
white
wrist
.
A
quick
impulse
that
was
*NL*
somewhat
spasmodic
impelled
her
fingers
to
close
in
a
sort
of
clutch
*NL*
upon
his
hand
.
He
felt
the
pressure
of
her
pointed
nails
in
the
flesh
of
*NL*
his
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
arose
hastily
and
walked
toward
the
mantel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sight
of
a
wound
or
scar
always
agitates
and
sickens
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
have
looked
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
he
entreated
,
following
her
;
``
it
never
occurred
to
*NL*
me
that
it
might
be
repulsive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
close
to
her
,
and
the
effrontery
in
his
eyes
repelled
the
old
,
*NL*
vanishing
self
in
her
,
yet
drew
all
her
awakening
sensuousness
.
He
saw
*NL*
enough
in
her
face
to
impel
him
to
take
her
hand
and
hold
it
while
he
*NL*
said
his
lingering
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
go
to
the
races
again
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
've
had
enough
of
the
races
.
I
do
n't
want
to
lose
all
*NL*
the
money
I
've
won
,
and
I
've
got
to
work
when
the
weather
is
bright
,
*NL*
instead
of
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
work
;
to
be
sure
.
You
promised
to
show
me
your
work
.
What
morning
*NL*
may
I
come
up
to
your
atelier
?
To-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
after
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
refuse
me
!
I
know
something
of
such
things
.
I
might
*NL*
help
you
with
a
stray
suggestion
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Good
night
.
Why
do
n't
you
go
after
you
have
said
good
night
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
you
,
''
she
went
on
in
a
high
,
excited
pitch
,
attempting
*NL*
to
draw
away
her
hand
.
She
felt
that
her
words
lacked
dignity
and
*NL*
sincerity
,
and
she
knew
that
he
felt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
you
do
n't
like
me
.
I
'm
sorry
I
offended
you
.
How
have
I
*NL*
offended
you
?
What
have
I
done
?
Ca
n't
you
forgive
me
?
''
And
he
bent
and
*NL*
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
hand
as
if
he
wished
never
more
to
withdraw
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Arobin
,
''
she
complained
,
``
I
'm
greatly
upset
by
the
excitement
of
*NL*
the
afternoon
;
I
'm
not
myself
.
My
manner
must
have
misled
you
in
some
*NL*
way
.
I
wish
you
to
go
,
please
.
''
She
spoke
in
a
monotonous
,
dull
tone
.
*NL*
He
took
his
hat
from
the
table
,
and
stood
with
eyes
turned
from
her
,
*NL*
looking
into
the
dying
fire
.
For
a
moment
or
two
he
kept
an
impressive
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
manner
has
not
misled
me
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
''
he
said
finally
.
``
My
*NL*
own
emotions
have
done
that
.
I
could
n't
help
it
.
When
I
'm
near
you

how
*NL*
could
I
help
it
?
Do
n't
think
anything
of
it

do
n't
bother

You
*NL*
see
,
I
go
when
you
command
me
.
If
you
wish
me
to
stay
away
,
I
shall
do
*NL*
so
.
If
you
let
me
come
back
,
I
--
oh
!
you
will
let
me
come
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
one
appealing
glance
at
her
,
to
which
she
made
no
response
.
*NL*
Alcee
Arobin
's
manner
was
so
genuine
that
it
often
deceived
even
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
did
not
care
or
think
whether
it
were
genuine
or
not
.
When
she
*NL*
was
alone
she
looked
mechanically
at
the
back
of
her
hand
which
he
had
*NL*
kissed
so
warmly
.
Then
she
leaned
her
head
down
on
the
mantelpiece
.
She
*NL*
felt
somewhat
like
a
woman
who
in
a
moment
of
passion
is
betrayed
into
*NL*
an
act
of
infidelity
,
and
realizes
the
significance
of
the
act
without
*NL*
being
wholly
awakened
from
its
glamour
.
The
thought
was
passing
vaguely
*NL*
through
her
mind
,
``
What
would
he
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
mean
her
husband
;
she
was
thinking
of
Robert
Lebrun
.
Her
*NL*
husband
seemed
to
her
now
like
a
person
whom
she
had
married
without
*NL*
love
as
an
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lit
a
candle
and
went
up
to
her
room
.
Alcee
Arobin
was
absolutely
*NL*
nothing
to
her
.
Yet
his
presence
,
his
manners
,
the
warmth
of
his
*NL*
glances
,
and
above
all
the
touch
of
his
lips
upon
her
hand
had
acted
*NL*
like
a
narcotic
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
a
languorous
sleep
,
interwoven
with
vanishing
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Alcee
Arobin
wrote
Edna
an
elaborate
note
of
apology
,
palpitant
with
*NL*
sincerity
.
It
embarrassed
her
;
for
in
a
cooler
,
quieter
moment
it
*NL*
appeared
to
her
,
absurd
that
she
should
have
taken
his
action
so
*NL*
seriously
,
so
dramatically
.
She
felt
sure
that
the
significance
of
the
*NL*
whole
occurrence
had
lain
in
her
own
self-consciousness
.
If
she
ignored
*NL*
his
note
it
would
give
undue
importance
to
a
trivial
affair
.
If
she
*NL*
replied
to
it
in
a
serious
spirit
it
would
still
leave
in
his
mind
*NL*
the
impression
that
she
had
in
a
susceptible
moment
yielded
to
his
*NL*
influence
.
After
all
,
it
was
no
great
matter
to
have
one
's
hand
kissed
.
*NL*
She
was
provoked
at
his
having
written
the
apology
.
She
answered
in
as
*NL*
light
and
bantering
a
spirit
as
she
fancied
it
deserved
,
and
said
she
*NL*
would
be
glad
to
have
him
look
in
upon
her
at
work
whenever
he
felt
the
*NL*
inclination
and
his
business
gave
him
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
responded
at
once
by
presenting
himself
at
her
home
with
all
his
*NL*
disarming
naivete
.
And
then
there
was
scarcely
a
day
which
followed
*NL*
that
she
did
not
see
him
or
was
not
reminded
of
him
.
He
was
prolific
in
*NL*
pretexts
.
His
attitude
became
one
of
good-humored
subservience
and
tacit
*NL*
adoration
.
He
was
ready
at
all
times
to
submit
to
her
moods
,
which
were
*NL*
as
often
kind
as
they
were
cold
.
She
grew
accustomed
to
him
.
They
became
*NL*
intimate
and
friendly
by
imperceptible
degrees
,
and
then
by
leaps
.
He
*NL*
sometimes
talked
in
a
way
that
astonished
her
at
first
and
brought
the
*NL*
crimson
into
her
face
;
in
a
way
that
pleased
her
at
last
,
appealing
to
*NL*
the
animalism
that
stirred
impatiently
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
which
so
quieted
the
turmoil
of
Edna
's
senses
as
*NL*
a
visit
to
Mademoiselle
Reisz
.
It
was
then
,
in
the
presence
of
that
*NL*
personality
which
was
offensive
to
her
,
that
the
woman
,
by
her
divine
*NL*
art
,
seemed
to
reach
Edna
's
spirit
and
set
it
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
misty
,
with
heavy
,
lowering
atmosphere
,
one
afternoon
,
when
*NL*
Edna
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
pianist
's
apartments
under
the
roof
.
Her
*NL*
clothes
were
dripping
with
moisture
.
She
felt
chilled
and
pinched
as
she
*NL*
entered
the
room
.
Mademoiselle
was
poking
at
a
rusty
stove
that
smoked
a
*NL*
little
and
warmed
the
room
indifferently
.
She
was
endeavoring
to
heat
*NL*
a
pot
of
chocolate
on
the
stove
.
The
room
looked
cheerless
and
dingy
to
*NL*
Edna
as
she
entered
.
A
bust
of
Beethoven
,
covered
with
a
hood
of
dust
,
*NL*
scowled
at
her
from
the
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
comes
the
sunlight
!
''
exclaimed
Mademoiselle
,
rising
from
her
*NL*
knees
before
the
stove
.
``
Now
it
will
be
warm
and
bright
enough
;
I
can
*NL*
let
the
fire
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
the
stove
door
with
a
bang
,
and
approaching
,
assisted
in
*NL*
removing
Edna
's
dripping
mackintosh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
cold
;
you
look
miserable
.
The
chocolate
will
soon
be
hot
.
But
*NL*
would
you
rather
have
a
taste
of
brandy
?
I
have
scarcely
touched
the
*NL*
bottle
which
you
brought
me
for
my
cold
.
''
A
piece
of
red
flannel
was
*NL*
wrapped
around
Mademoiselle
's
throat
;
a
stiff
neck
compelled
her
to
hold
*NL*
her
head
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
some
brandy
,
''
said
Edna
,
shivering
as
she
removed
her
*NL*
gloves
and
overshoes
.
She
drank
the
liquor
from
the
glass
as
a
man
would
*NL*
have
done
.
Then
flinging
herself
upon
the
uncomfortable
sofa
she
said
,
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
I
am
going
to
move
away
from
my
house
on
Esplanade
*NL*
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
ejaculated
the
musician
,
neither
surprised
nor
especially
*NL*
interested
.
Nothing
ever
seemed
to
astonish
her
very
much
.
She
was
*NL*
endeavoring
to
adjust
the
bunch
of
violets
which
had
become
loose
from
*NL*
its
fastening
in
her
hair
.
Edna
drew
her
down
upon
the
sofa
,
and
taking
*NL*
a
pin
from
her
own
hair
,
secured
the
shabby
artificial
flowers
in
their
*NL*
accustomed
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
astonished
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Passably
.
Where
are
you
going
?
to
New
York
?
to
Iberville
?
to
your
*NL*
father
in
Mississippi
?
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
two
steps
away
,
''
laughed
Edna
,
``
in
a
little
four-room
house
around
*NL*
the
corner
.
It
looks
so
cozy
,
so
inviting
and
restful
,
whenever
I
pass
*NL*
by
;
and
it
's
for
rent
.
I
'm
tired
looking
after
that
big
house
.
It
never
*NL*
seemed
like
mine
,
anyway
--
like
home
.
It
's
too
much
trouble
.
I
have
to
*NL*
keep
too
many
servants
.
I
am
tired
bothering
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
your
true
reason
,
ma
belle
.
There
is
no
use
in
telling
me
*NL*
lies
.
I
do
n't
know
your
reason
,
but
you
have
not
told
me
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
Edna
did
not
protest
or
endeavor
to
justify
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
,
the
money
that
provides
for
it
,
are
not
mine
.
Is
n't
that
*NL*
enough
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
your
husband
's
,
''
returned
Mademoiselle
,
with
a
shrug
and
a
*NL*
malicious
elevation
of
the
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
see
there
is
no
deceiving
you
.
Then
let
me
tell
you
:
It
is
a
*NL*
caprice
.
I
have
a
little
money
of
my
own
from
my
mother
's
estate
,
which
*NL*
my
father
sends
me
by
driblets
.
I
won
a
large
sum
this
winter
on
the
*NL*
races
,
and
I
am
beginning
to
sell
my
sketches
.
Laidpore
is
more
and
more
*NL*
pleased
with
my
work
;
he
says
it
grows
in
force
and
individuality
.
I
*NL*
can
not
judge
of
that
myself
,
but
I
feel
that
I
have
gained
in
ease
*NL*
and
confidence
.
However
,
as
I
said
,
I
have
sold
a
good
many
through
*NL*
Laidpore
.
I
can
live
in
the
tiny
house
for
little
or
nothing
,
with
one
*NL*
servant
.
Old
Celestine
,
who
works
occasionally
for
me
,
says
she
will
*NL*
come
stay
with
me
and
do
my
work
.
I
know
I
shall
like
it
,
like
the
*NL*
feeling
of
freedom
and
independence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
your
husband
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
told
him
yet
.
I
only
thought
of
it
this
morning
.
He
will
*NL*
think
I
am
demented
,
no
doubt
.
Perhaps
you
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
shook
her
head
slowly
.
``
Your
reason
is
not
yet
clear
to
*NL*
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
was
it
quite
clear
to
Edna
herself
;
but
it
unfolded
itself
as
*NL*
she
sat
for
a
while
in
silence
.
Instinct
had
prompted
her
to
put
away
*NL*
her
husband
's
bounty
in
casting
off
her
allegiance
.
She
did
not
know
how
*NL*
it
would
be
when
he
returned
.
There
would
have
to
be
an
understanding
,
*NL*
an
explanation
.
Conditions
would
some
way
adjust
themselves
,
she
felt
;
*NL*
but
whatever
came
,
she
had
resolved
never
again
to
belong
to
another
*NL*
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
give
a
grand
dinner
before
I
leave
the
old
house
!
''
Edna
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
You
will
have
to
come
to
it
,
Mademoiselle
.
I
will
give
you
*NL*
everything
that
you
like
to
eat
and
to
drink
.
We
shall
sing
and
laugh
*NL*
and
be
merry
for
once
.
''
And
she
uttered
a
sigh
that
came
from
the
very
*NL*
depths
of
her
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mademoiselle
happened
to
have
received
a
letter
from
Robert
*NL*
during
the
interval
of
Edna
's
visits
,
she
would
give
her
the
letter
*NL*
unsolicited
.
And
she
would
seat
herself
at
the
piano
and
play
as
her
*NL*
humor
prompted
her
while
the
young
woman
read
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
stove
was
roaring
;
it
was
red-hot
,
and
the
chocolate
in
the
*NL*
tin
sizzled
and
sputtered
.
Edna
went
forward
and
opened
the
stove
door
,
*NL*
and
Mademoiselle
rising
,
took
a
letter
from
under
the
bust
of
Beethoven
*NL*
and
handed
it
to
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
!
so
soon
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
her
eyes
filled
with
delight
.
``
Tell
*NL*
me
,
Mademoiselle
,
does
he
know
that
I
see
his
letters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
in
the
world
!
He
would
be
angry
and
would
never
write
to
me
again
*NL*
if
he
thought
so
.
Does
he
write
to
you
?
Never
a
line
.
Does
he
send
you
*NL*
a
message
?
Never
a
word
.
It
is
because
he
loves
you
,
poor
fool
,
and
*NL*
is
trying
to
forget
you
,
since
you
are
not
free
to
listen
to
him
or
to
*NL*
belong
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
show
me
his
letters
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
begged
for
them
?
Can
I
refuse
you
anything
?
Oh
!
you
can
not
*NL*
deceive
me
,
''
and
Mademoiselle
approached
her
beloved
instrument
and
*NL*
began
to
play
.
Edna
did
not
at
once
read
the
letter
.
She
sat
holding
*NL*
it
in
her
hand
,
while
the
music
penetrated
her
whole
being
like
an
*NL*
effulgence
,
warming
and
brightening
the
dark
places
of
her
soul
.
It
*NL*
prepared
her
for
joy
and
exultation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
letting
the
letter
fall
to
the
floor
.
``
Why
did
*NL*
you
not
tell
me
?
''
She
went
and
grasped
Mademoiselle
's
hands
up
from
the
*NL*
keys
.
``
Oh
!
unkind
!
malicious
!
Why
did
you
not
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
was
coming
back

No
great
news

I
wonder
he
did
not

come
long
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when

when

''
cried
Edna
,
impatiently
.
``
He
does
not
say
when

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
`
very
soon

You
know
as
much
about
it
as
I
do

it
is
all
in
*NL*
the
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
Why
is
he
coming
?
Oh
,
if
I
thought

''
and
she
snatched
the
*NL*
letter
from
the
floor
and
turned
the
pages
this
way
and
that
way
,
*NL*
looking
for
the
reason
,
which
was
left
untold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
young
and
in
love
with
a
man

''
said
Mademoiselle
,
turning
on
*NL*
the
stool
and
pressing
her
wiry
hands
between
her
knees
as
she
looked
*NL*
down
at
Edna
,
who
sat
on
the
floor
holding
the
letter
,
``
it
seems
to
me

he
would
have
to
be
some
grand
esprit

a
man
with
lofty
aims

*NL*
to
reach
them
;
one
who
stood
high
enough
to
attract
the
notice
of
his
*NL*
fellow-men

It
seems
to
me
if
I
were
young
and
in
love
I
should
never

a
man

ordinary
caliber
worthy

my
devotion

*NL*

Now
it

Mademoiselle

never
been

nothing

Why

''
went
on
Edna
,
clasping
her
knees
and
looking
up
into
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
twisted
face
,
``
do
you
suppose
a
woman
knows

with
presidential
possibilities

I
shall
proceed

``
Yes

said
Edna

It
was
the
first
time
she
had
admitted
it

and
a
glow
*NL*
overspread
her
face
,
blotching
it
with
red
spots

*NL*
*NL*
``

asked
her

*NL*
Edna
,
with
a
motion

dragged
herself
on
her
knees
before
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz

who
took
the
glowing
face
between
her
two
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Because
his

brown

eyes
,
and
his
nose
is
a
little
out
of
drawing
;
*NL*
because
he
has
two
lips
and
a
square
chin
,
and
a
little
finger
which
he
*NL*
ca
n't
straighten
from
having
played
baseball
too
energetically
in
his
*NL*
youth
.
Because
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
do
,
in
short
,
''
laughed
Mademoiselle
.
``
What
will
you
do
when
*NL*
he
comes
back
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
?
Nothing
,
except
feel
glad
and
happy
to
be
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
already
glad
and
happy
to
be
alive
at
the
mere
thought
of
his
*NL*
return
.
The
murky
,
lowering
sky
,
which
had
depressed
her
a
few
hours
*NL*
before
,
seemed
bracing
and
invigorating
as
she
splashed
through
the
*NL*
streets
on
her
way
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
at
a
confectioner
's
and
ordered
a
huge
box
of
bonbons
for
*NL*
the
children
in
Iberville
.
She
slipped
a
card
in
the
box
,
on
which
she
*NL*
scribbled
a
tender
message
and
sent
an
abundance
of
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
dinner
in
the
evening
Edna
wrote
a
charming
letter
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
telling
him
of
her
intention
to
move
for
a
while
into
the
*NL*
little
house
around
the
block
,
and
to
give
a
farewell
dinner
before
*NL*
leaving
,
regretting
that
he
was
not
there
to
share
it
,
to
help
out
*NL*
with
the
menu
and
assist
her
in
entertaining
the
guests
.
Her
letter
was
*NL*
brilliant
and
brimming
with
cheerfulness
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
asked
Arobin
that
evening
.
``
I
never
*NL*
found
you
in
such
a
happy
mood
.
''
Edna
was
tired
by
that
time
,
and
was
*NL*
reclining
on
the
lounge
before
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
the
weather
prophet
has
told
us
we
shall
see
the
sun
*NL*
pretty
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
ought
to
be
reason
enough
,
''
he
acquiesced
.
``
You
would
n't
*NL*
give
me
another
if
I
sat
here
all
night
imploring
you
.
''
He
sat
close
to
*NL*
her
on
a
low
tabouret
,
and
as
he
spoke
his
fingers
lightly
touched
the
*NL*
hair
that
fell
a
little
over
her
forehead
.
She
liked
the
touch
of
his
*NL*
fingers
through
her
hair
,
and
closed
her
eyes
sensitively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
these
days
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'm
going
to
pull
myself
together
for
a
*NL*
while
and
think

try
to
determine
what
character
of
a
woman
I
am
;
for

*NL*
candidly

I
do
n't
know
.
By
all
the
codes
which
I
am
acquainted
with
,
*NL*
I
am
a
devilishly
wicked
specimen
of
the
sex
.
But
some
way
I
ca
n't
*NL*
convince
myself
that
I
am

I
must
think
about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

What

Why
should
you
bother
thinking
about
it
when
*NL*
I
can
tell
you
what
manner
of
woman
you
are
.
''
His
fingers
strayed
*NL*
occasionally
down
to
her
warm
,
smooth
cheeks
and
firm
chin
,
which
was
*NL*
growing
a
little
full
and
double
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
You
will
tell
me
that
I
am
adorable

everything
that
is
*NL*
captivating

Spare
yourself

effort

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
sha

you
anything
of

*NL*
``
Do

Reisz

she
asked
irrelevantly
.

*NL*
``
The

heard

play

*NL*
``
She

queer
things
sometimes
in

bantering
way

notice
at

find
yourself
thinking
about
afterward

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
instance

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
for
instance
,
when
I
left
her
to-day
,
she
put
her
arms
around
me
*NL*
and
felt
my
shoulder
blades
,
to
see
if
my
wings
were
strong

she
*NL*
said
.
`
The
bird
that
would
soar
above
the
level
plain
of
tradition
*NL*
and
prejudice
must
have
strong
wings

It
is
a
sad
spectacle
to
see
the
*NL*
weaklings
bruised
,
exhausted
,
fluttering
back
to
earth
.

Whither
would
*NL*
you
soar

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

only
half
comprehend

her

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
she
's
partially
demented

said
Arobin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
to
me
wonderfully
sane
,
''
Edna
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
told
she
's
extremely
disagreeable
and
unpleasant
.
Why
have
you
*NL*
introduced
her
at
a
moment
when
I
desired
to
talk
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
talk
of
me
if
you
like
,
''
cried
Edna
,
clasping
her
hands
beneath
her
*NL*
head
;
``
but
let
me
think
of
something
else
while
you
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
jealous

your
thoughts
tonight

They

making
you
a

kinder
than

but
some
way
I
feel
as
if
they
were
wandering
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
not
here
with
me
.
''
She
only
looked
at
him
and
smiled
.
His
eyes
*NL*
were
very
near
.
He
leaned
upon
the
lounge
with
an
arm
extended
across
*NL*
her
,
while
the
other
hand
still
rested
upon
her
hair
.
They
continued
*NL*
silently
to
look
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
When
he
leaned
forward
and
*NL*
kissed
her
,
she
clasped
his
head
,
holding
his
lips
to
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
kiss
of
her
life
to
which
her
nature
had
really
*NL*
responded
.
It
was
a
flaming
torch
that
kindled
desire
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
cried
a
little
that
night
after
Arobin
left
her
.
It
was
only
one
*NL*
phase
of
the
multitudinous
emotions
which
had
assailed
her
.
There
was
*NL*
with
her
an
overwhelming
feeling
of
irresponsibility
.
There
was
the
*NL*
shock
of
the
unexpected
and
the
unaccustomed
.
There
was
her
husband
's
*NL*
reproach
looking
at
her
from
the
external
things
around
her
which
he
had
*NL*
provided
for
her
external
existence
.
There
was
Robert
's
reproach
making
*NL*
itself
felt
by
a
quicker
,
fiercer
,
more
overpowering
love
,
which
had
*NL*
awakened
within
her
toward
him
.
Above
all
,
there
was
understanding
.
She
*NL*
felt
as
if
a
mist
had
been
lifted
from
her
eyes
,
enabling
her
to
took
*NL*
upon
and
comprehend
the
significance
of
life
,
that
monster
made
up
*NL*
of
beauty
and
brutality
.
But
among
the
conflicting
sensations
which
*NL*
assailed
her
,
there
was
neither
shame
nor
remorse
.
There
was
a
dull
pang
*NL*
of
regret
because
it
was
not
the
kiss
of
love
which
had
inflamed
her
,
*NL*
because
it
was
not
love
which
had
held
this
cup
of
life
to
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Without
even
waiting
for
an
answer
from
her
husband
regarding
his
*NL*
opinion
or
wishes
in
the
matter
,
Edna
hastened
her
preparations
for
*NL*
quitting
her
home
on
Esplanade
Street
and
moving
into
the
little
house
*NL*
around
the
block
.
A
feverish
anxiety
attended
her
every
action
in
that
*NL*
direction
.
There
was
no
moment
of
deliberation
,
no
interval
of
repose
*NL*
between
the
thought
and
its
fulfillment
.
Early
upon
the
morning
*NL*
following
those
hours
passed
in
Arobin
's
society
,
Edna
set
about
*NL*
securing
her
new
abode
and
hurrying
her
arrangements
for
occupying
it
.
*NL*
Within
the
precincts
of
her
home
she
felt
like
one
who
has
entered
and
*NL*
lingered
within
the
portals
of
some
forbidden
temple
in
which
a
thousand
*NL*
muffled
voices
bade
her
begone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
was
her
own
in
the
house
,
everything
which
she
had
acquired
*NL*
aside
from
her
husband
's
bounty
,
she
caused
to
be
transported
to
the
*NL*
other
house
,
supplying
simple
and
meager
deficiencies
from
her
own
*NL*
resources
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arobin
found
her
with
rolled
sleeves
,
working
in
company
with
the
*NL*
house-maid
when
he
looked
in
during
the
afternoon
.
She
was
splendid
and
*NL*
robust
,
and
had
never
appeared
handsomer
than
in
the
old
blue
gown
,
with
*NL*
a
red
silk
handkerchief
knotted
at
random
around
her
head
to
protect
her
*NL*
hair
from
the
dust
.
She
was
mounted
upon
a
high
stepladder
,
unhooking
a
*NL*
picture
from
the
wall
when
he
entered
.
He
had
found
the
front
door
open
,
*NL*
and
had
followed
his
ring
by
walking
in
unceremoniously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
!
''
he
said
.
``
Do
you
want
to
kill
yourself
?
''
She
greeted
him
*NL*
with
affected
carelessness
,
and
appeared
absorbed
in
her
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
expected
to
find
her
languishing
,
reproachful
,
or
indulging
in
*NL*
sentimental
tears
,
he
must
have
been
greatly
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
doubt
prepared
for
any
emergency
,
ready
for
any
one
of
the
*NL*
foregoing
attitudes
,
just
as
he
bent
himself
easily
and
naturally
to
the
*NL*
situation
which
confronted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
come
down
,
''
he
insisted
,
holding
the
ladder
and
looking
up
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
;
``
Ellen
is
afraid
to
mount
the
ladder
.
Joe
is
working
*NL*
over
at
the
`
pigeon
house
'
--
that
's
the
name
Ellen
gives
it
,
because
it
's
*NL*
so
small
and
looks
like
a
pigeon
house
--
and
some
one
has
to
do
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Arobin
pulled
off
his
coat
,
and
expressed
himself
ready
and
willing
to
*NL*
tempt
fate
in
her
place
.
Ellen
brought
him
one
of
her
dust-caps
,
*NL*
and
went
into
contortions
of
mirth
,
which
she
found
it
impossible
to
*NL*
control
,
when
she
saw
him
put
it
on
before
the
mirror
as
grotesquely
as
*NL*
he
could
.
Edna
herself
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
when
she
fastened
*NL*
it
at
his
request
.
So
it
was
he
who
in
turn
mounted
the
ladder
,
*NL*
unhooking
pictures
and
curtains
,
and
dislodging
ornaments
as
Edna
*NL*
directed
.
When
he
had
finished
he
took
off
his
dust-cap
and
went
out
to
*NL*
wash
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
was
sitting
on
the
tabouret
,
idly
brushing
the
tips
of
a
feather
*NL*
duster
along
the
carpet
when
he
came
in
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
more
you
will
let
me
do
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
,
''
she
answered
.
``
Ellen
can
manage
the
rest
.
''
She
kept
the
*NL*
young
woman
occupied
in
the
drawing-room
,
unwilling
to
be
left
alone
*NL*
with
Arobin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
the
dinner
?
''
he
asked
;
``
the
grand
event
,
the
coup
d'etat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
day
after
to-morrow
.
Why
do
you
call
it
the
`
coup
d'etat
?
'
*NL*
Oh
!
it
will
be
very
fine
;
all
my
best
of
everything
--
crystal
,
silver
and
*NL*
gold
,
Sevres
,
flowers
,
music
,
and
champagne
to
swim
in
.
I
'll
let
Leonce
*NL*
pay
the
bills
.
I
wonder
what
he
'll
say
when
he
sees
the
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ask
me
why
I
call
it
a
coup
d'etat
?
''
Arobin
had
put
on
his
*NL*
coat
,
and
he
stood
before
her
and
asked
if
his
cravat
was
plumb
.
She
*NL*
told
him
it
was
,
looking
no
higher
than
the
tip
of
his
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
go
to
the
`
pigeon
house
?

--
with
all
due
acknowledgment
to
*NL*
Ellen

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
after

shall
sleep
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ellen

will
you
very
kindly
get
me
a
glass
of
water
?

asked
Arobin
.
*NL*
``
The
dust
in
the
curtains
,
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
hinting
such
a

thing

parched
my
throat
to
a
crisp
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
While
Ellen
gets
the
water
,
''
said
Edna
,
rising
,
``
I
will
say
good-by
and
*NL*
let
you
go

I
must
get
rid
of
this
grime

have
a
million
things
to
*NL*
do
and
think
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
shall
I
see
you
?
''
asked
Arobin
,
seeking
to
detain
her

the
maid
*NL*
having
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
dinner

course

are
invited

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

not
to-night

noon

after
morning

noon
?
Ca
n't
you
see
yourself
,
without
*NL*
my
telling
you
,
what
an
eternity
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
followed
her
into
the
hall
and
to
the
foot
of
the
stairway
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
her
as
she
mounted
with
her
face
half
turned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
an
instant
sooner
,
''
she
said
.
But
she
laughed
and
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
eyes
that
at
once
gave
him
courage
to
wait
and
made
it
torture
to
*NL*
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Edna
had
spoken
of
the
dinner
as
a
very
grand
affair
,
it
was
*NL*
in
truth
a
very
small
affair
and
very
select
,
in
so
much
as
the
guests
*NL*
invited
were
few
and
were
selected
with
discrimination
.
She
had
counted
*NL*
upon
an
even
dozen
seating
themselves
at
her
round
mahogany
board
,
*NL*
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
Madame
Ratignolle
was
to
the
last
degree
*NL*
souffrante
and
unpresentable
,
and
not
foreseeing
that
Madame
Lebrun
*NL*
would
send
a
thousand
regrets
at
the
last
moment
.
So
there
were
only
*NL*
ten
,
after
all
,
which
made
a
cozy
,
comfortable
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Merriman
,
a
pretty
,
vivacious
little
woman
in
*NL*
the
thirties
;
her
husband
,
a
jovial
fellow
,
something
of
a
shallow-pate
,
*NL*
who
laughed
a
good
deal
at
other
people
's
witticisms
,
and
had
thereby
*NL*
made
himself
extremely
popular
.
Mrs.
Highcamp
had
accompanied
them
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
there
was
Alcee
Arobin
;
and
Mademoiselle
Reisz
had
consented
*NL*
to
come
.
Edna
had
sent
her
a
fresh
bunch
of
violets
with
black
lace
*NL*
trimmings
for
her
hair
.
Monsieur
Ratignolle
brought
himself
and
his
*NL*
wife
's
excuses
.
Victor
Lebrun
,
who
happened
to
be
in
the
city
,
bent
upon
*NL*
relaxation
,
had
accepted
with
alacrity
.
There
was
a
Miss
Mayblunt
,
no
*NL*
longer
in
her
teens
,
who
looked
at
the
world
through
lorgnettes
and
with
*NL*
the
keenest
interest
.
It
was
thought
and
said
that
she
was
intellectual
;
*NL*
it
was
suspected
of
her
that
she
wrote
under
a
nom
de
guerre
.
She
had
*NL*
come
with
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
Gouvernail
,
connected
with
one
of
*NL*
the
daily
papers
,
of
whom
nothing
special
could
be
said
,
except
that
he
*NL*
was
observant
and
seemed
quiet
and
inoffensive
.
Edna
herself
made
the
*NL*
tenth
,
and
at
half-past
eight
they
seated
themselves
at
table
,
Arobin
*NL*
and
Monsieur
Ratignolle
on
either
side
of
their
hostess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Highcamp
sat
between
Arobin
and
Victor
Lebrun
.
Then
came
Mrs.
*NL*
Merriman
,
Mr.
Gouvernail
,
Miss
Mayblunt
,
Mr.
Merriman
,
and
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Reisz
next
to
Monsieur
Ratignolle
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
extremely
gorgeous
about
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
table
,
an
effect
of
splendor
conveyed
by
a
cover
of
pale
yellow
satin
*NL*
under
strips
of
lace-work
.
There
were
wax
candles
,
in
massive
brass
*NL*
candelabra
,
burning
softly
under
yellow
silk
shades
;
full
,
fragrant
*NL*
roses
,
yellow
and
red
,
abounded
.
There
were
silver
and
gold
,
as
she
had
*NL*
said
there
would
be
,
and
crystal
which
glittered
like
the
gems
which
the
*NL*
women
wore
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ordinary
stiff
dining
chairs
had
been
discarded
for
the
occasion
and
*NL*
replaced
by
the
most
commodious
and
luxurious
which
could
be
collected
*NL*
throughout
the
house
.
Mademoiselle
Reisz
,
being
exceedingly
diminutive
,
*NL*
was
elevated
upon
cushions
,
as
small
children
are
sometimes
hoisted
at
*NL*
table
upon
bulky
volumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
new
,
Edna
?
''
exclaimed
Miss
Mayblunt
,
with
lorgnette
directed
*NL*
toward
a
magnificent
cluster
of
diamonds
that
sparkled
,
that
almost
*NL*
sputtered
,
in
Edna
's
hair
,
just
over
the
center
of
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
new
;
`
brand
'
new
,
in
fact
;
a
present
from
my
husband
.
It
*NL*
arrived
this
morning
from
New
York
.
I
may
as
well
admit
that
this
is
my
*NL*
birthday
,
and
that
I
am
twenty-nine
.
In
good
time
I
expect
you
to
drink
*NL*
my
health
.
Meanwhile
,
I
shall
ask
you
to
begin
with
this
cocktail
,
*NL*
composed
--
would
you
say
`
composed
?
'
''
with
an
appeal
to
Miss
*NL*
Mayblunt
--
``
composed
by
my
father
in
honor
of
Sister
Janet
's
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
each
guest
stood
a
tiny
glass
that
looked
and
sparkled
like
a
*NL*
garnet
gem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
all
things
considered
,
''
spoke
Arobin
,
``
it
might
not
be
amiss
*NL*
to
start
out
by
drinking
the
Colonel
's
health
in
the
cocktail
which
he
*NL*
composed
,
on
the
birthday
of
the
most
charming
of
women
--
the
daughter
*NL*
whom
he
invented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Merriman
's
laugh
at
this
sally
was
such
a
genuine
outburst
and
so
*NL*
contagious
that
it
started
the
dinner
with
an
agreeable
swing
that
never
*NL*
slackened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Mayblunt
begged
to
be
allowed
to
keep
her
cocktail
untouched
before
*NL*
her
,
just
to
look
at
.
The
color
was
marvelous
!
She
could
compare
it
to
*NL*
nothing
she
had
ever
seen
,
and
the
garnet
lights
which
it
emitted
were
*NL*
unspeakably
rare
.
She
pronounced
the
Colonel
an
artist
,
and
stuck
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
prepared
to
take
things
seriously
;
the
mets
,
the
*NL*
entre-mets
,
the
service
,
the
decorations
,
even
the
people
.
He
looked
*NL*
up
from
his
pompano
and
inquired
of
Arobin
if
he
were
related
to
the
*NL*
gentleman
of
that
name
who
formed
one
of
the
firm
of
Laitner
and
Arobin
,
*NL*
lawyers
.
The
young
man
admitted
that
Laitner
was
a
warm
personal
friend
,
*NL*
who
permitted
Arobin
's
name
to
decorate
the
firm
's
letterheads
and
to
*NL*
appear
upon
a
shingle
that
graced
Perdido
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
so
many
inquisitive
people
and
institutions
abounding
,
''
said
*NL*
Arobin
,
``
that
one
is
really
forced
as
a
matter
of
convenience
these
*NL*
days
to
assume
the
virtue
of
an
occupation
if
he
has
it
not
.
''
Monsieur
*NL*
Ratignolle
stared
a
little
,
and
turned
to
ask
Mademoiselle
Reisz
if
she
*NL*
considered
the
symphony
concerts
up
to
the
standard
which
had
been
set
*NL*
the
previous
winter
.
Mademoiselle
Reisz
answered
Monsieur
Ratignolle
in
*NL*
French
,
which
Edna
thought
a
little
rude
,
under
the
circumstances
,
but
*NL*
characteristic
.
Mademoiselle
had
only
disagreeable
things
to
say
of
the
*NL*
symphony
concerts
,
and
insulting
remarks
to
make
of
all
the
musicians
*NL*
of
New
Orleans
,
singly
and
collectively
.
All
her
interest
seemed
to
be
*NL*
centered
upon
the
delicacies
placed
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Merriman
said
that
Mr.
Arobin
's
remark
about
inquisitive
people
*NL*
reminded
him
of
a
man
from
Waco
the
other
day
at
the
St.
Charles
*NL*
Hotel
--
but
as
Mr.
Merriman
's
stories
were
always
lame
and
lacking
point
,
*NL*
his
wife
seldom
permitted
him
to
complete
them
.
She
interrupted
him
to
*NL*
ask
if
he
remembered
the
name
of
the
author
whose
book
she
had
bought
*NL*
the
week
before
to
send
to
a
friend
in
Geneva
.
She
was
talking
``
books
''
*NL*
with
Mr.
Gouvernail
and
trying
to
draw
from
him
his
opinion
upon
current
*NL*
literary
topics
.
Her
husband
told
the
story
of
the
Waco
man
privately
*NL*
to
Miss
Mayblunt
,
who
pretended
to
be
greatly
amused
and
to
think
it
*NL*
extremely
clever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Highcamp
hung
with
languid
but
unaffected
interest
upon
the
warm
*NL*
and
impetuous
volubility
of
her
left-hand
neighbor
,
Victor
Lebrun
.
*NL*
Her
attention
was
never
for
a
moment
withdrawn
from
him
after
seating
*NL*
herself
at
table
;
and
when
he
turned
to
Mrs.
Merriman
,
who
was
prettier
*NL*
and
more
vivacious
than
Mrs.
Highcamp
,
she
waited
with
easy
indifference
*NL*
for
an
opportunity
to
reclaim
his
attention
.
There
was
the
occasional
*NL*
sound
of
music
,
of
mandolins
,
sufficiently
removed
to
be
an
agreeable
*NL*
accompaniment
rather
than
an
interruption
to
the
conversation
.
Outside
*NL*
the
soft
,
monotonous
splash
of
a
fountain
could
be
heard
;
the
sound
*NL*
penetrated
into
the
room
with
the
heavy
odor
of
jessamine
that
came
*NL*
through
the
open
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
golden
shimmer
of
Edna
's
satin
gown
spread
in
rich
folds
on
either
*NL*
side
of
her
.
There
was
a
soft
fall
of
lace
encircling
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
It
was
the
color
of
her
skin
,
without
the
glow
,
the
myriad
living
tints
*NL*
that
one
may
sometimes
discover
in
vibrant
flesh
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
her
attitude
,
in
her
whole
appearance
when
she
leaned
her
head
against
*NL*
the
high-backed
chair
and
spread
her
arms
,
which
suggested
the
regal
*NL*
woman
,
the
one
who
rules
,
who
looks
on
,
who
stands
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
sat
there
amid
her
guests
,
she
felt
the
old
ennui
overtaking
*NL*
her
;
the
hopelessness
which
so
often
assailed
her
,
which
came
upon
her
*NL*
like
an
obsession
,
like
something
extraneous
,
independent
of
volition
.
*NL*
It
was
something
which
announced
itself
;
a
chill
breath
that
seemed
to
*NL*
issue
from
some
vast
cavern
wherein
discords
waited
.
There
came
over
her
*NL*
the
acute
longing
which
always
summoned
into
her
spiritual
vision
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
beloved
one
,
overpowering
her
at
once
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
the
unattainable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moments
glided
on
,
while
a
feeling
of
good
fellowship
passed
around
*NL*
the
circle
like
a
mystic
cord
,
holding
and
binding
these
people
together
*NL*
with
jest
and
laughter
.
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
the
first
to
break
the
*NL*
pleasant
charm
.
At
ten
o'clock
he
excused
himself
.
Madame
Ratignolle
*NL*
was
waiting
for
him
at
home
.
She
was
bien
souffrante
,
and
she
was
filled
*NL*
with
vague
dread
,
which
only
her
husband
's
presence
could
allay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
arose
with
Monsieur
Ratignolle
,
who
offered
to
escort
*NL*
her
to
the
car
.
She
had
eaten
well
;
she
had
tasted
the
good
,
rich
wines
,
*NL*
and
they
must
have
turned
her
head
,
for
she
bowed
pleasantly
to
all
*NL*
as
she
withdrew
from
table
.
She
kissed
Edna
upon
the
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
whispered
:
``
Bonne
nuit
,
ma
reine
;
soyez
sage
.
''
She
had
been
a
little
*NL*
bewildered
upon
rising
,
or
rather
,
descending
from
her
cushions
,
and
*NL*
Monsieur
Ratignolle
gallantly
took
her
arm
and
led
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Highcamp
was
weaving
a
garland
of
roses
,
yellow
and
red
.
When
she
*NL*
had
finished
the
garland
,
she
laid
it
lightly
upon
Victor
's
black
curls
.
*NL*
He
was
reclining
far
back
in
the
luxurious
chair
,
holding
a
glass
of
*NL*
champagne
to
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
a
magician
's
wand
had
touched
him
,
the
garland
of
roses
*NL*
transformed
him
into
a
vision
of
Oriental
beauty
.
His
cheeks
were
the
*NL*
color
of
crushed
grapes
,
and
his
dusky
eyes
glowed
with
a
languishing
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sapristi
!
''
exclaimed
Arobin
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Highcamp
had
one
more
touch
to
add
to
the
picture
.
She
took
*NL*
from
the
back
of
her
chair
a
white
silken
scarf
,
with
which
she
had
*NL*
covered
her
shoulders
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
.
She
draped
it
*NL*
across
the
boy
in
graceful
folds
,
and
in
a
way
to
conceal
his
black
,
*NL*
conventional
evening
dress
.
He
did
not
seem
to
mind
what
she
did
to
him
,
*NL*
only
smiled
,
showing
a
faint
gleam
of
white
teeth
,
while
he
continued
to
*NL*
gaze
with
narrowing
eyes
at
the
light
through
his
glass
of
champagne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
to
be
able
to
paint
in
color
rather
than
in
words
!
''
exclaimed
Miss
*NL*
Mayblunt
,
losing
herself
in
a
rhapsodic
dream
as
she
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
There
was
a
graven
image
of
Desire
Painted
with
red
blood
on
a
ground
*NL*
of
gold
.
'
''
murmured
Gouvernail
,
under
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
the
wine
upon
Victor
was
to
change
his
accustomed
*NL*
volubility
into
silence
.
He
seemed
to
have
abandoned
himself
to
a
*NL*
reverie
,
and
to
be
seeing
pleasing
visions
in
the
amber
bead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sing
,
''
entreated
Mrs.
Highcamp
.
``
Wo
n't
you
sing
to
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
alone
,
''
said
Arobin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
posing
,
''
offered
Mr.
Merriman
;
``
let
him
have
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
he
's
paralyzed
,
''
laughed
Mrs.
Merriman
.
And
leaning
over
the
*NL*
youth
's
chair
,
she
took
the
glass
from
his
hand
and
held
it
to
his
lips
.
*NL*
He
sipped
the
wine
slowly
,
and
when
he
had
drained
the
glass
she
laid
it
*NL*
upon
the
table
and
wiped
his
lips
with
her
little
filmy
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'll
sing
for
you
,
''
he
said
,
turning
in
his
chair
toward
Mrs.
*NL*
Highcamp
.
He
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
head
,
and
looking
up
at
the
*NL*
ceiling
began
to
hum
a
little
,
trying
his
voice
like
a
musician
tuning
*NL*
an
instrument
.
Then
,
looking
at
Edna
,
he
began
to
sing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
si
tu
savais
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
she
cried
,
``
do
n't
sing
that
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
sing
it
,
''
*NL*
and
she
laid
her
glass
so
impetuously
and
blindly
upon
the
table
as
to
*NL*
shatter
it
against
a
carafe
.
The
wine
spilled
over
Arobin
's
legs
and
*NL*
some
of
it
trickled
down
upon
Mrs.
Highcamp
's
black
gauze
gown
.
Victor
*NL*
had
lost
all
idea
of
courtesy
,
or
else
he
thought
his
hostess
was
not
in
*NL*
earnest
,
for
he
laughed
and
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
si
tu
savais
*NL*
*NL*
Ce
que
tes
yeux
me
disent
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
must
n't
!
you
must
n't
,
''
exclaimed
Edna
,
and
pushing
back
her
*NL*
chair
she
got
up
,
and
going
behind
him
placed
her
hand
over
his
mouth
.
*NL*
He
kissed
the
soft
palm
that
pressed
upon
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
I
wo
n't
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
.
I
did
n't
know
you
meant
it
,
''
looking
*NL*
up
at
her
with
caressing
eyes
.
The
touch
of
his
lips
was
like
a
pleasing
*NL*
sting
to
her
hand
.
She
lifted
the
garland
of
roses
from
his
head
and
*NL*
flung
it
across
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Victor
;
you
've
posed
long
enough
.
Give
Mrs.
Highcamp
her
scarf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Highcamp
undraped
the
scarf
from
about
him
with
her
own
hands
.
Miss
*NL*
Mayblunt
and
Mr.
Gouvernail
suddenly
conceived
the
notion
that
it
was
*NL*
time
to
say
good
night
.
And
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Merriman
wondered
how
it
could
*NL*
be
so
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
parting
from
Victor
,
Mrs.
Highcamp
invited
him
to
call
upon
her
*NL*
daughter
,
who
she
knew
would
be
charmed
to
meet
him
and
talk
French
and
*NL*
sing
French
songs
with
him
.
Victor
expressed
his
desire
and
intention
to
*NL*
call
upon
Miss
Highcamp
at
the
first
opportunity
which
presented
itself
.
*NL*
He
asked
if
Arobin
were
going
his
way
.
Arobin
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mandolin
players
had
long
since
stolen
away
.
A
profound
stillness
*NL*
had
fallen
upon
the
broad
,
beautiful
street
.
The
voices
of
Edna
's
*NL*
disbanding
guests
jarred
like
a
discordant
note
upon
the
quiet
harmony
*NL*
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
questioned
Arobin
,
who
had
remained
with
Edna
after
the
others
*NL*
had
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
reiterated
,
and
stood
up
,
stretching
her
arms
,
and
feeling
*NL*
the
need
to
relax
her
muscles
after
having
been
so
long
seated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
next
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
servants
are
all
gone
.
They
left
when
the
musicians
did
.
I
have
*NL*
dismissed
them
.
The
house
has
to
be
closed
and
locked
,
and
I
shall
trot
*NL*
around
to
the
pigeon
house
,
and
shall
send
Celestine
over
in
the
morning
*NL*
to
straighten
things
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
around
,
and
began
to
turn
out
some
of
the
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
upstairs
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
all
right
;
but
there
may
be
a
window
or
two
unlatched
.
We
*NL*
had
better
look
;
you
might
take
a
candle
and
see
.
And
bring
me
my
wrap
*NL*
and
hat
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
the
middle
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
with
the
light
,
and
Edna
began
closing
doors
and
windows
.
She
*NL*
hated
to
shut
in
the
smoke
and
the
fumes
of
the
wine
.
Arobin
found
her
*NL*
cape
and
hat
,
which
he
brought
down
and
helped
her
to
put
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
everything
was
secured
and
the
lights
put
out
,
they
left
through
*NL*
the
front
door
,
Arobin
locking
it
and
taking
the
key
,
which
he
carried
*NL*
for
Edna
.
He
helped
her
down
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
a
spray
of
jessamine
?
''
he
asked
,
breaking
off
a
few
*NL*
blossoms
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
want
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
disheartened
,
and
had
nothing
to
say
.
She
took
his
arm
,
which
*NL*
he
offered
her
,
holding
up
the
weight
of
her
satin
train
with
the
other
*NL*
hand
.
She
looked
down
,
noticing
the
black
line
of
his
leg
moving
in
and
*NL*
out
so
close
to
her
against
the
yellow
shimmer
of
her
gown
.
There
*NL*
was
the
whistle
of
a
railway
train
somewhere
in
the
distance
,
and
the
*NL*
midnight
bells
were
ringing
.
They
met
no
one
in
their
short
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
pigeon
house
''
stood
behind
a
locked
gate
,
and
a
shallow
parterre
*NL*
that
had
been
somewhat
neglected
.
There
was
a
small
front
porch
,
upon
*NL*
which
a
long
window
and
the
front
door
opened
.
The
door
opened
directly
*NL*
into
the
parlor
;
there
was
no
side
entry
.
Back
in
the
yard
was
a
room
*NL*
for
servants
,
in
which
old
Celestine
had
been
ensconced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
had
left
a
lamp
burning
low
upon
the
table
.
She
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
making
the
room
look
habitable
and
homelike
.
There
were
some
books
on
*NL*
the
table
and
a
lounge
near
at
hand
.
On
the
floor
was
a
fresh
matting
,
*NL*
covered
with
a
rug
or
two
;
and
on
the
walls
hung
a
few
tasteful
*NL*
pictures
.
But
the
room
was
filled
with
flowers
.
These
were
a
surprise
to
*NL*
her
.
Arobin
had
sent
them
,
and
had
had
Celestine
distribute
them
during
*NL*
Edna
's
absence
.
Her
bedroom
was
adjoining
,
and
across
a
small
passage
*NL*
were
the
dining-room
and
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
seated
herself
with
every
appearance
of
discomfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
tired
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
chilled
,
and
miserable
.
I
feel
as
if
I
had
been
wound
up
to
a
*NL*
certain
pitch
--
too
tight
--
and
something
inside
of
me
had
snapped
.
''
She
*NL*
rested
her
head
against
the
table
upon
her
bare
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
rest
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
to
be
quiet
.
I
'll
go
;
I
'll
leave
you
*NL*
and
let
you
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
beside
her
and
smoothed
her
hair
with
his
soft
,
magnetic
*NL*
hand
.
His
touch
conveyed
to
her
a
certain
physical
comfort
.
She
could
*NL*
have
fallen
quietly
asleep
there
if
he
had
continued
to
pass
his
hand
*NL*
over
her
hair
.
He
brushed
the
hair
upward
from
the
nape
of
her
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
will
feel
better
and
happier
in
the
morning
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
*NL*
have
tried
to
do
too
much
in
the
past
few
days
.
The
dinner
was
the
last
*NL*
straw
;
you
might
have
dispensed
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
admitted
;
``
it
was
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
delightful
;
but
it
has
worn
you
out
.
''
His
hand
had
strayed
*NL*
to
her
beautiful
shoulders
,
and
he
could
feel
the
response
of
her
flesh
*NL*
to
his
touch
.
He
seated
himself
beside
her
and
kissed
her
lightly
upon
*NL*
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
away
,
''
she
said
,
in
an
uneven
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
after
I
have
said
good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
,
except
to
continue
to
caress
her
.
He
did
not
say
good
*NL*
night
until
she
had
become
supple
to
his
gentle
,
seductive
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*

XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Pontellier
learned
of
his
wife
's
intention
to
abandon
her
home
*NL*
and
take
up
her
residence
elsewhere
,
he
immediately
wrote
her
a
letter
*NL*
of
unqualified
disapproval
and
remonstrance
.
She
had
given
reasons
which
*NL*
he
was
unwilling
to
acknowledge
as
adequate
.
He
hoped
she
had
not
acted
*NL*
upon
her
rash
impulse
;
and
he
begged
her
to
consider
first
,
foremost
,
*NL*
and
above
all
else
,
what
people
would
say
.
He
was
not
dreaming
of
*NL*
scandal
when
he
uttered
this
warning
;
that
was
a
thing
which
would
never
*NL*
have
entered
into
his
mind
to
consider
in
connection
with
his
wife
's
*NL*
name
or
his
own
.
He
was
simply
thinking
of
his
financial
integrity
.
It
*NL*
might
get
noised
about
that
the
Pontelliers
had
met
with
reverses
,
and
*NL*
were
forced
to
conduct
their
menage
on
a
humbler
scale
than
heretofore
.
*NL*
It
might
do
incalculable
mischief
to
his
business
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
remembering
Edna
's
whimsical
turn
of
mind
of
late
,
and
foreseeing
*NL*
that
she
had
immediately
acted
upon
her
impetuous
determination
,
he
*NL*
grasped
the
situation
with
his
usual
promptness
and
handled
it
with
his
*NL*
well-known
business
tact
and
cleverness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
mail
which
brought
to
Edna
his
letter
of
disapproval
carried
*NL*
instructions
--
the
most
minute
instructions
--
to
a
well-known
architect
*NL*
concerning
the
remodeling
of
his
home
,
changes
which
he
had
long
*NL*
contemplated
,
and
which
he
desired
carried
forward
during
his
temporary
*NL*
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Expert
and
reliable
packers
and
movers
were
engaged
to
convey
the
*NL*
furniture
,
carpets
,
pictures
--
everything
movable
,
in
short
--
to
places
*NL*
of
security
.
And
in
an
incredibly
short
time
the
Pontellier
house
*NL*
was
turned
over
to
the
artisans
.
There
was
to
be
an
addition
--
a
small
*NL*
snuggery
;
there
was
to
be
frescoing
,
and
hardwood
flooring
was
to
be
put
*NL*
into
such
rooms
as
had
not
yet
been
subjected
to
this
improvement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Furthermore
,
in
one
of
the
daily
papers
appeared
a
brief
notice
to
the
*NL*
effect
that
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
were
contemplating
a
summer
sojourn
*NL*
abroad
,
and
that
their
handsome
residence
on
Esplanade
Street
was
*NL*
undergoing
sumptuous
alterations
,
and
would
not
be
ready
for
occupancy
*NL*
until
their
return
.
Mr.
Pontellier
had
saved
appearances
!
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
admired
the
skill
of
his
maneuver
,
and
avoided
any
occasion
to
balk
*NL*
his
intentions
.
When
the
situation
as
set
forth
by
Mr.
Pontellier
was
*NL*
accepted
and
taken
for
granted
,
she
was
apparently
satisfied
that
it
*NL*
should
be
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pigeon
house
pleased
her
.
It
at
once
assumed
the
intimate
character
*NL*
of
a
home
,
while
she
herself
invested
it
with
a
charm
which
it
reflected
*NL*
like
a
warm
glow
.
There
was
with
her
a
feeling
of
having
descended
in
*NL*
the
social
scale
,
with
a
corresponding
sense
of
having
risen
in
the
*NL*
spiritual
.
Every
step
which
she
took
toward
relieving
herself
from
*NL*
obligations
added
to
her
strength
and
expansion
as
an
individual
.
She
*NL*
began
to
look
with
her
own
eyes
;
to
see
and
to
apprehend
the
deeper
*NL*
undercurrents
of
life
.
No
longer
was
she
content
to
``
feed
upon
opinion
''
*NL*
when
her
own
soul
had
invited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
,
a
few
days
,
in
fact
,
Edna
went
up
and
spent
a
week
*NL*
with
her
children
in
Iberville
.
They
were
delicious
February
days
,
with
*NL*
all
the
summer
's
promise
hovering
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
glad
she
was
to
see
the
children
!
She
wept
for
very
pleasure
when
*NL*
she
felt
their
little
arms
clasping
her
;
their
hard
,
ruddy
cheeks
*NL*
pressed
against
her
own
glowing
cheeks
.
She
looked
into
their
faces
with
*NL*
hungry
eyes
that
could
not
be
satisfied
with
looking
.
And
what
stories
*NL*
they
had
to
tell
their
mother
!
About
the
pigs
,
the
cows
,
the
mules
!
*NL*
About
riding
to
the
mill
behind
Gluglu
;
fishing
back
in
the
lake
with
*NL*
their
Uncle
Jasper
;
picking
pecans
with
Lidie
's
little
black
brood
,
and
*NL*
hauling
chips
in
their
express
wagon
.
It
was
a
thousand
times
more
fun
*NL*
to
haul
real
chips
for
old
lame
Susie
's
real
fire
than
to
drag
painted
*NL*
blocks
along
the
banquette
on
Esplanade
Street
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
with
them
herself
to
see
the
pigs
and
the
cows
,
to
look
at
the
*NL*
darkies
laying
the
cane
,
to
thrash
the
pecan
trees
,
and
catch
fish
in
*NL*
the
back
lake
.
She
lived
with
them
a
whole
week
long
,
giving
them
all
of
*NL*
herself
,
and
gathering
and
filling
herself
with
their
young
existence
.
*NL*
They
listened
,
breathless
,
when
she
told
them
the
house
in
Esplanade
*NL*
Street
was
crowded
with
workmen
,
hammering
,
nailing
,
sawing
,
and
filling
*NL*
the
place
with
clatter
.
They
wanted
to
know
where
their
bed
was
;
what
*NL*
had
been
done
with
their
rocking-horse
;
and
where
did
Joe
sleep
,
and
*NL*
where
had
Ellen
gone
,
and
the
cook
?
But
,
above
all
,
they
were
fired
with
*NL*
a
desire
to
see
the
little
house
around
the
block
.
Was
there
any
*NL*
place
to
play
?
Were
there
any
boys
next
door
?
Raoul
,
with
pessimistic
*NL*
foreboding
,
was
convinced
that
there
were
only
girls
next
door
.
Where
*NL*
would
they
sleep
,
and
where
would
papa
sleep
?
She
told
them
the
fairies
*NL*
would
fix
it
all
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
Madame
was
charmed
with
Edna
's
visit
,
and
showered
all
manner
*NL*
of
delicate
attentions
upon
her
.
She
was
delighted
to
know
that
the
*NL*
Esplanade
Street
house
was
in
a
dismantled
condition
.
It
gave
her
the
*NL*
promise
and
pretext
to
keep
the
children
indefinitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
wrench
and
a
pang
that
Edna
left
her
children
.
She
carried
*NL*
away
with
her
the
sound
of
their
voices
and
the
touch
of
their
cheeks
.
*NL*
All
along
the
journey
homeward
their
presence
lingered
with
her
like
the
*NL*
memory
of
a
delicious
song
.
But
by
the
time
she
had
regained
the
city
*NL*
the
song
no
longer
echoed
in
her
soul
.
She
was
again
alone
.

*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
sometimes
when
Edna
went
to
see
Mademoiselle
Reisz
that
*NL*
the
little
musician
was
absent
,
giving
a
lesson
or
making
some
small
*NL*
necessary
household
purchase
.
The
key
was
always
left
in
a
secret
*NL*
hiding-place
in
the
entry
,
which
Edna
knew
.
If
Mademoiselle
happened
to
*NL*
be
away
,
Edna
would
usually
enter
and
wait
for
her
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
knocked
at
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
door
one
afternoon
there
was
*NL*
no
response
;
so
unlocking
the
door
,
as
usual
,
she
entered
and
found
the
*NL*
apartment
deserted
,
as
she
had
expected
.
Her
day
had
been
quite
filled
*NL*
up
,
and
it
was
for
a
rest
,
for
a
refuge
,
and
to
talk
about
Robert
,
that
*NL*
she
sought
out
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
worked
at
her
canvas
--
a
young
Italian
character
study
--
all
the
*NL*
morning
,
completing
the
work
without
the
model
;
but
there
had
been
many
*NL*
interruptions
,
some
incident
to
her
modest
housekeeping
,
and
others
of
a
*NL*
social
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Ratignolle
had
dragged
herself
over
,
avoiding
the
too
public
*NL*
thoroughfares
,
she
said
.
She
complained
that
Edna
had
neglected
her
*NL*
much
of
late
.
Besides
,
she
was
consumed
with
curiosity
to
see
the
little
*NL*
house
and
the
manner
in
which
it
was
conducted
.
She
wanted
to
hear
all
*NL*
about
the
dinner
party
;
Monsieur
Ratignolle
had
left
so
early
.
What
had
*NL*
happened
after
he
left
?
The
champagne
and
grapes
which
Edna
sent
over
*NL*
were
TOO
delicious
.
She
had
so
little
appetite
;
they
had
refreshed
and
*NL*
toned
her
stomach
.
Where
on
earth
was
she
going
to
put
Mr.
Pontellier
in
*NL*
that
little
house
,
and
the
boys
?
And
then
she
made
Edna
promise
to
go
to
*NL*
her
when
her
hour
of
trial
overtook
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
time
--
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
,
dear
,
''
Edna
assured
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
leaving
Madame
Ratignolle
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
some
way
you
seem
to
me
like
a
child
,
Edna
.
You
seem
to
act
without
*NL*
a
certain
amount
of
reflection
which
is
necessary
in
this
life
.
That
is
*NL*
the
reason
I
want
to
say
you
must
n't
mind
if
I
advise
you
to
be
a
little
*NL*
careful
while
you
are
living
here
alone
.
Why
do
n't
you
have
some
one
*NL*
come
and
stay
with
you
?
Would
n't
Mademoiselle
Reisz
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
she
would
n't
wish
to
come
,
and
I
should
n't
want
her
always
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
reason
--
you
know
how
evil-minded
the
world
is
--
some
one
was
*NL*
talking
of
Alcee
Arobin
visiting
you
.
Of
course
,
it
would
n't
matter
if
*NL*
Mr.
Arobin
had
not
such
a
dreadful
reputation
.
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
*NL*
telling
me
that
his
attentions
alone
are
considered
enough
to
ruin
a
*NL*
woman
's
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
boast
of
his
successes
?
''
asked
Edna
,
indifferently
,
squinting
*NL*
at
her
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
not
.
I
believe
he
is
a
decent
fellow
as
far
as
that
goes
.
*NL*
But
his
character
is
so
well
known
among
the
men
.
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
*NL*
come
back
and
see
you
;
it
was
very
,
very
imprudent
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
the
step
!
''
cried
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
neglect
me
,
''
entreated
Madame
Ratignolle
;
``
and
do
n't
mind
what
I
*NL*
said
about
Arobin
,
or
having
some
one
to
stay
with
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
Edna
laughed
.
``
You
may
say
anything
you
like
to
me
.
''
*NL*
They
kissed
each
other
good-by
.
Madame
Ratignolle
had
not
far
to
go
,
and
*NL*
Edna
stood
on
the
porch
a
while
watching
her
walk
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
in
the
afternoon
Mrs.
Merriman
and
Mrs.
Highcamp
had
made
their
*NL*
``
party
call
.
''
Edna
felt
that
they
might
have
dispensed
with
the
*NL*
formality
.
They
had
also
come
to
invite
her
to
play
vingt-et-un
one
*NL*
evening
at
Mrs.
Merriman
's
.
She
was
asked
to
go
early
,
to
dinner
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Merriman
or
Mr.
Arobin
would
take
her
home
.
Edna
accepted
in
a
*NL*
half-hearted
way
.
She
sometimes
felt
very
tired
of
Mrs.
Highcamp
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Merriman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
in
the
afternoon
she
sought
refuge
with
Mademoiselle
Reisz
,
and
*NL*
stayed
there
alone
,
waiting
for
her
,
feeling
a
kind
of
repose
invade
her
*NL*
with
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
shabby
,
unpretentious
little
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
sat
at
the
window
,
which
looked
out
over
the
house-tops
and
across
*NL*
the
river
.
The
window
frame
was
filled
with
pots
of
flowers
,
and
she
sat
*NL*
and
picked
the
dry
leaves
from
a
rose
geranium
.
The
day
was
warm
,
and
*NL*
the
breeze
which
blew
from
the
river
was
very
pleasant
.
She
removed
her
*NL*
hat
and
laid
it
on
the
piano
.
She
went
on
picking
the
leaves
and
*NL*
digging
around
the
plants
with
her
hat
pin
.
Once
she
thought
she
heard
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
approaching
.
But
it
was
a
young
black
girl
,
who
*NL*
came
in
,
bringing
a
small
bundle
of
laundry
,
which
she
deposited
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
room
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
seated
herself
at
the
piano
,
and
softly
picked
out
with
one
hand
*NL*
the
bars
of
a
piece
of
music
which
lay
open
before
her
.
A
half-hour
went
*NL*
by
.
There
was
the
occasional
sound
of
people
going
and
coming
in
the
*NL*
lower
hall
.
She
was
growing
interested
in
her
occupation
of
picking
out
*NL*
the
aria
,
when
there
was
a
second
rap
at
the
door
.
She
vaguely
wondered
*NL*
what
these
people
did
when
they
found
Mademoiselle
's
door
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
she
called
,
turning
her
face
toward
the
door
.
And
this
time
*NL*
it
was
Robert
Lebrun
who
presented
himself
.
She
attempted
to
rise
;
she
*NL*
could
not
have
done
so
without
betraying
the
agitation
which
mastered
*NL*
her
at
sight
of
him
,
so
she
fell
back
upon
the
stool
,
only
exclaiming
,
*NL*
``
Why
,
Robert
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
and
clasped
her
hand
,
seemingly
without
knowing
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
or
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Pontellier
!
How
do
you
happen
--
oh
!
how
well
you
look
!
Is
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
not
here
?
I
never
expected
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
come
back
?
''
asked
Edna
in
an
unsteady
voice
,
wiping
her
*NL*
face
with
her
handkerchief
.
She
seemed
ill
at
ease
on
the
piano
stool
,
*NL*
and
he
begged
her
to
take
the
chair
by
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
so
,
mechanically
,
while
he
seated
himself
on
the
stool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
returned
day
before
yesterday
,
''
he
answered
,
while
he
leaned
his
arm
*NL*
on
the
keys
,
bringing
forth
a
crash
of
discordant
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
before
yesterday
!
''
she
repeated
,
aloud
;
and
went
on
thinking
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
day
before
yesterday
,
''
in
a
sort
of
an
uncomprehending
way
.
*NL*
She
had
pictured
him
seeking
her
at
the
very
first
hour
,
and
he
had
*NL*
lived
under
the
same
sky
since
day
before
yesterday
;
while
only
by
*NL*
accident
had
he
stumbled
upon
her
.
Mademoiselle
must
have
lied
when
she
*NL*
said
,
``
Poor
fool
,
he
loves
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Day
before
yesterday
,
''
she
repeated
,
breaking
off
a
spray
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
geranium
;
``
then
if
you
had
not
met
me
here
to-day
you
*NL*
would
n't
--
when
--
that
is
,
did
n't
you
mean
to
come
and
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
should
have
gone
to
see
you
.
There
have
been
so
many
*NL*
things
--
''
he
turned
the
leaves
of
Mademoiselle
's
music
nervously
.
``
I
*NL*
started
in
at
once
yesterday
with
the
old
firm
.
After
all
there
is
as
*NL*
much
chance
for
me
here
as
there
was
there
--
that
is
,
I
might
find
it
*NL*
profitable
some
day
.
The
Mexicans
were
not
very
congenial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
had
come
back
because
the
Mexicans
were
not
congenial
;
because
*NL*
business
was
as
profitable
here
as
there
;
because
of
any
reason
,
and
not
*NL*
because
he
cared
to
be
near
her
.
She
remembered
the
day
she
sat
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
turning
the
pages
of
his
letter
,
seeking
the
reason
which
was
*NL*
left
untold
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
noticed
how
he
looked
--
only
feeling
his
presence
;
but
she
*NL*
turned
deliberately
and
observed
him
.
After
all
,
he
had
been
absent
but
*NL*
a
few
months
,
and
was
not
changed
.
His
hair
--
the
color
of
hers
--
waved
*NL*
back
from
his
temples
in
the
same
way
as
before
.
His
skin
was
not
more
*NL*
burned
than
it
had
been
at
Grand
Isle
.
She
found
in
his
eyes
,
when
he
*NL*
looked
at
her
for
one
silent
moment
,
the
same
tender
caress
,
with
an
*NL*
added
warmth
and
entreaty
which
had
not
been
there
before
the
same
*NL*
glance
which
had
penetrated
to
the
sleeping
places
of
her
soul
and
*NL*
awakened
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hundred
times
Edna
had
pictured
Robert
's
return
,
and
imagined
their
*NL*
first
meeting
.
It
was
usually
at
her
home
,
whither
he
had
sought
her
out
*NL*
at
once
.
She
always
fancied
him
expressing
or
betraying
in
some
way
his
*NL*
love
for
her
.
And
here
,
the
reality
was
that
they
sat
ten
feet
apart
,
*NL*
she
at
the
window
,
crushing
geranium
leaves
in
her
hand
and
smelling
*NL*
them
,
he
twirling
around
on
the
piano
stool
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
much
surprised
to
hear
of
Mr.
Pontellier
's
absence
;
it
's
a
*NL*
wonder
Mademoiselle
Reisz
did
not
tell
me
;
and
your
moving
--
mother
told
*NL*
me
yesterday
.
I
should
think
you
would
have
gone
to
New
York
with
him
,
*NL*
or
to
Iberville
with
the
children
,
rather
than
be
bothered
here
with
*NL*
housekeeping
.
And
you
are
going
abroad
,
too
,
I
hear
.
We
sha
n't
have
*NL*
you
at
Grand
Isle
next
summer
;
it
wo
n't
seem
--
do
you
see
much
of
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Reisz
?
She
often
spoke
of
you
in
the
few
letters
she
*NL*
wrote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
that
you
promised
to
write
to
me
when
you
went
away
?
''
A
*NL*
flush
overspread
his
whole
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
believe
that
my
letters
would
be
of
any
interest
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
an
excuse
;
it
is
n't
the
truth
.
''
Edna
reached
for
her
hat
on
the
*NL*
piano
.
She
adjusted
it
,
sticking
the
hat
pin
through
the
heavy
coil
of
*NL*
hair
with
some
deliberation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
not
going
to
wait
for
Mademoiselle
Reisz
?
''
asked
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
found
when
she
is
absent
this
long
,
she
is
liable
not
to
*NL*
come
back
till
late
.
''
She
drew
on
her
gloves
,
and
Robert
picked
up
his
*NL*
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
wait
for
her
?
''
asked
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
think
she
will
not
be
back
till
late
,
''
adding
,
as
if
*NL*
suddenly
aware
of
some
discourtesy
in
his
speech
,
``
and
I
should
miss
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
walking
home
with
you
.
''
Edna
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
*NL*
back
in
its
hiding-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
together
,
picking
their
way
across
muddy
streets
and
sidewalks
*NL*
encumbered
with
the
cheap
display
of
small
tradesmen
.
Part
of
the
*NL*
distance
they
rode
in
the
car
,
and
after
disembarking
,
passed
the
*NL*
Pontellier
mansion
,
which
looked
broken
and
half
torn
asunder
.
Robert
*NL*
had
never
known
the
house
,
and
looked
at
it
with
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
knew
you
in
your
home
,
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
did
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
She
did
not
answer
.
They
went
on
around
the
corner
,
and
it
seemed
*NL*
as
if
her
dreams
were
coming
true
after
all
,
when
he
followed
her
into
*NL*
the
little
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
stay
and
dine
with
me
,
Robert
.
You
see
I
am
all
alone
,
and
it
*NL*
is
so
long
since
I
have
seen
you
.
There
is
so
much
I
want
to
ask
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
off
her
hat
and
gloves
.
He
stood
irresolute
,
making
some
excuse
*NL*
about
his
mother
who
expected
him
;
he
even
muttered
something
about
an
*NL*
engagement
.
She
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
lamp
on
the
table
;
it
was
*NL*
growing
dusk
.
When
he
saw
her
face
in
the
lamp-light
,
looking
pained
,
*NL*
with
all
the
soft
lines
gone
out
of
it
,
he
threw
his
hat
aside
and
*NL*
seated
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
you
know
I
want
to
stay
if
you
will
let
me
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
All
*NL*
the
softness
came
back
.
She
laughed
,
and
went
and
put
her
hand
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
moment
you
have
seemed
like
the
old
Robert
.
I
'll
*NL*
go
tell
Celestine
.
''
She
hurried
away
to
tell
Celestine
to
set
an
extra
*NL*
place
.
She
even
sent
her
off
in
search
of
some
added
delicacy
which
*NL*
she
had
not
thought
of
for
herself
.
And
she
recommended
great
care
in
*NL*
dripping
the
coffee
and
having
the
omelet
done
to
a
proper
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reentered
,
Robert
was
turning
over
magazines
,
sketches
,
*NL*
and
things
that
lay
upon
the
table
in
great
disorder
.
He
picked
up
a
*NL*
photograph
,
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alcee
Arobin
!
What
on
earth
is
his
picture
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
to
make
a
sketch
of
his
head
one
day
,
''
answered
Edna
,
``
and
*NL*
he
thought
the
photograph
might
help
me
.
It
was
at
the
other
house
.
I
*NL*
thought
it
had
been
left
there
.
I
must
have
packed
it
up
with
my
drawing
*NL*
materials
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
would
give
it
back
to
him
if
you
have
finished
with
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
have
a
great
many
such
photographs
.
I
never
think
of
returning
*NL*
them
.
They
do
n't
amount
to
anything
.
''
Robert
kept
on
looking
at
the
*NL*
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
--
do
you
think
his
head
worth
drawing
?
Is
he
a
friend
of
*NL*
Mr.
Pontellier
's
?
You
never
said
you
knew
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
n't
a
friend
of
Mr.
Pontellier
's
;
he
's
a
friend
of
mine

I
always
*NL*
knew
him
--
that
is
,
it
is
only
of
late
that
I
know
him
pretty
well
.
But
*NL*
I
'd
rather
talk
about
you
,
and
know
what
you
have
been
seeing
and
doing
*NL*
and
feeling
out
there
in
Mexico
.
''
Robert
threw
aside
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
seeing
the
waves
and
the
white
beach
of
Grand
Isle
;
the
*NL*
quiet
,
grassy
street
of
the
Cheniere
;
the
old
fort
at
Grande
Terre
.
I
've
*NL*
been
working
like
a
machine
,
and
feeling
like
a
lost
soul
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
you
been
seeing
and
doing
and
feeling
all
these
days
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
seeing
the
waves
and
the
white
beach
of
Grand
Isle
;
the
*NL*
quiet
,
grassy
street
of
the
Cheniere
Caminada
;
the
old
sunny
fort
at
*NL*
Grande
Terre
.
I
've
been
working
with
a
little
more
comprehension
than
*NL*
a
machine
,
and
still
feeling
like
a
lost
soul
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
you
are
cruel
,
''
he
said
,
with
feeling
,
closing
his
*NL*
eyes
and
resting
his
head
back
in
his
chair
.
They
remained
in
silence
*NL*
till
old
Celestine
announced
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
dining-room
was
very
small
.
Edna
's
round
mahogany
would
have
almost
*NL*
filled
it
.
As
it
was
there
was
but
a
step
or
two
from
the
little
table
*NL*
to
the
kitchen
,
to
the
mantel
,
the
small
buffet
,
and
the
side
door
that
*NL*
opened
out
on
the
narrow
brick-paved
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
degree
of
ceremony
settled
upon
them
with
the
announcement
of
*NL*
dinner
.
There
was
no
return
to
personalities
.
Robert
related
incidents
*NL*
of
his
sojourn
in
Mexico
,
and
Edna
talked
of
events
likely
to
interest
*NL*
him
,
which
had
occurred
during
his
absence
.
The
dinner
was
of
ordinary
*NL*
quality
,
except
for
the
few
delicacies
which
she
had
sent
out
to
*NL*
purchase
.
Old
Celestine
,
with
a
bandana
tignon
twisted
about
her
head
,
*NL*
hobbled
in
and
out
,
taking
a
personal
interest
in
everything
;
and
she
*NL*
lingered
occasionally
to
talk
patois
with
Robert
,
whom
she
had
known
as
*NL*
a
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
to
a
neighboring
cigar
stand
to
purchase
cigarette
papers
,
*NL*
and
when
he
came
back
he
found
that
Celestine
had
served
the
black
*NL*
coffee
in
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
should
n't
have
come
back
,
''
he
said
.
``
When
you
are
tired
of
*NL*
me
,
tell
me
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
tire
me
.
You
must
have
forgotten
the
hours
and
hours
at
*NL*
Grand
Isle
in
which
we
grew
accustomed
to
each
other
and
used
to
being
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
forgotten
nothing
at
Grand
Isle
,
''
he
said
,
not
looking
at
her
,
*NL*
but
rolling
a
cigarette
.
His
tobacco
pouch
,
which
he
laid
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
was
a
fantastic
embroidered
silk
affair
,
evidently
the
handiwork
*NL*
of
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
carry
your
tobacco
in
a
rubber
pouch
,
''
said
Edna
,
picking
*NL*
up
the
pouch
and
examining
the
needlework
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
was
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
buy
this
one
?
In
Mexico
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
given
to
me
by
a
Vera
Cruz
girl
;
they
are
very
generous
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
,
striking
a
match
and
lighting
his
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
handsome
,
I
suppose
,
those
Mexican
women
;
very
*NL*
picturesque
,
with
their
black
eyes
and
their
lace
scarfs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
are
;
others
are
hideous
,
just
as
you
find
women
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
she
like
--
the
one
who
gave
you
the
pouch
?
You
must
have
known
*NL*
her
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
very
ordinary
.
She
was
n't
of
the
slightest
importance
.
I
knew
*NL*
her
well
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
visit
at
her
house
?
Was
it
interesting
?
I
should
like
to
know
*NL*
and
hear
about
the
people
you
met
,
and
the
impressions
they
made
on
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
people
who
leave
impressions
not
so
lasting
as
the
*NL*
imprint
of
an
oar
upon
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
such
a
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
ungenerous
for
me
to
admit
that
she
was
of
that
order
and
*NL*
kind
.
''
He
thrust
the
pouch
back
in
his
pocket
,
as
if
to
put
away
the
*NL*
subject
with
the
trifle
which
had
brought
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arobin
dropped
in
with
a
message
from
Mrs.
Merriman
,
to
say
that
*NL*
the
card
party
was
postponed
on
account
of
the
illness
of
one
of
her
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Arobin
?
''
said
Robert
,
rising
from
the
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Lebrun
.
To
be
sure
!
I
heard
yesterday
you
were
back

How
did
they

treat
you
down
in
Mexique
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fairly
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
well
enough
to
keep
you
there

Stunning
girls
,
though
,
in
*NL*
Mexico

I
thought
I
should
never
get
away
from
Vera
Cruz
when
I
was
down
*NL*
there
a
couple
of
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
they
embroider
slippers
and
tobacco
pouches
and
hat-bands
and
*NL*
things
for
you
?
''
asked
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
!
no
!
I
did
n't
get
so
deep
in
their
regard

I
fear
they
made
more
*NL*
impression
on
me
than
I
made
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
less
fortunate

Robert

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
always
less
fortunate

Has
he
been
imparting
tender

confidences
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
imposing
myself
long
enough

said
Robert
,
rising
,
and
*NL*
shaking
hands
with
Edna
.
``
Please
convey
my
regards
to
Mr.
Pontellier
*NL*
when
you
write
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
hands
with
Arobin
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
fellow
,
that
Lebrun
,
''
said
Arobin
when
Robert
had
gone
.
``
I
never

heard
you
speak
of
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
him
last
summer
at
Grand
Isle

she
replied
.

Here
is
that

photograph

Do

you
want
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
want
with
it

Throw

She
threw
it
back
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
to
Mrs.
Merriman
's
,

she
said
.
``
If
you
see
her
,
tell
her
*NL*
so

But
perhaps
I
had
better
write

I
think
I
shall
write
now
,
and
say
*NL*
that
I
am
sorry
her
child
is
sick
,
and
tell
her
not
to
count
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
good
scheme
,
''
acquiesced
Arobin
.
``
I
do
n't
blame
you
;
*NL*
stupid
lot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
opened
the
blotter
,
and
having
procured
paper
and
pen
,
began
to
*NL*
write
the
note
.
Arobin
lit
a
cigar
and
read
the
evening
paper
,
which
he
*NL*
had
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
date
?
''
she
asked
.
He
told
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
mail
this
for
me
when
you
go
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
He
read
to
her
little
bits
out
of
the
newspaper
,
while
she
*NL*
straightened
things
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
?
''
he
asked
,
throwing
aside
the
paper
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
want
to
go
out
for
a
walk
or
a
drive
or
anything
?
It
would
be
a
fine
*NL*
night
to
drive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
but
just
be
quiet
.
You
go
away
and
*NL*
amuse
yourself
.
Do
n't
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
away
if
I
must
;
but
I
sha
n't
amuse
myself
.
You
know
that
I
only
*NL*
live
when
I
am
near
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
up
to
bid
her
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
one
of
the
things
you
always
say
to
women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
it
before
,
but
I
do
n't
think
I
ever
came
so
near
meaning
*NL*
it
,
''
he
answered
with
a
smile
.
There
were
no
warm
lights
in
her
eyes
;
*NL*
only
a
dreamy
,
absent
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
night
.
I
adore
you
.
Sleep
well
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
kissed
her
hand
*NL*
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stayed
alone
in
a
kind
of
reverie
--
a
sort
of
stupor
.
Step
by
step
*NL*
she
lived
over
every
instant
of
the
time
she
had
been
with
Robert
after
*NL*
he
had
entered
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
door
.
She
recalled
his
words
,
*NL*
his
looks
.
How
few
and
meager
they
had
been
for
her
hungry
heart
!
A
*NL*
vision
--
a
transcendently
seductive
vision
of
a
Mexican
girl
arose
before
*NL*
her
.
She
writhed
with
a
jealous
pang
.
She
wondered
when
he
would
come
*NL*
back
.
He
had
not
said
he
would
come
back
.
She
had
been
with
him
,
had
*NL*
heard
his
voice
and
touched
his
hand
.
But
some
way
he
had
seemed
nearer
*NL*
to
her
off
there
in
Mexico
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
full
of
sunlight
and
hope
.
Edna
could
see
before
her
no
*NL*
denial
--
only
the
promise
of
excessive
joy
.
She
lay
in
bed
awake
,
with
*NL*
bright
eyes
full
of
speculation
.
``
He
loves
you
,
poor
fool
.
''
If
she
could
*NL*
but
get
that
conviction
firmly
fixed
in
her
mind
,
what
mattered
about
*NL*
the
rest
?
She
felt
she
had
been
childish
and
unwise
the
night
before
in
*NL*
giving
herself
over
to
despondency
.
She
recapitulated
the
motives
which
*NL*
no
doubt
explained
Robert
's
reserve
.
They
were
not
insurmountable
;
they
*NL*
would
not
hold
if
he
really
loved
her
;
they
could
not
hold
against
her
*NL*
own
passion
,
which
he
must
come
to
realize
in
time
.
She
pictured
him
*NL*
going
to
his
business
that
morning
.
She
even
saw
how
he
was
dressed
;
*NL*
how
he
walked
down
one
street
,
and
turned
the
corner
of
another
;
saw
him
*NL*
bending
over
his
desk
,
talking
to
people
who
entered
the
office
,
going
*NL*
to
his
lunch
,
and
perhaps
watching
for
her
on
the
street
.
He
would
come
*NL*
to
her
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
,
sit
and
roll
his
cigarette
,
talk
a
*NL*
little
,
and
go
away
as
he
had
done
the
night
before
.
But
how
delicious
*NL*
it
would
be
to
have
him
there
with
her
!
She
would
have
no
regrets
,
nor
*NL*
seek
to
penetrate
his
reserve
if
he
still
chose
to
wear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
ate
her
breakfast
only
half
dressed
.
The
maid
brought
her
a
*NL*
delicious
printed
scrawl
from
Raoul
,
expressing
his
love
,
asking
her
to
*NL*
send
him
some
bonbons
,
and
telling
her
they
had
found
that
morning
ten
*NL*
tiny
white
pigs
all
lying
in
a
row
beside
Lidie
's
big
white
pig
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
also
came
from
her
husband
,
saying
he
hoped
to
be
back
early
*NL*
in
March
,
and
then
they
would
get
ready
for
that
journey
abroad
which
*NL*
he
had
promised
her
so
long
,
which
he
felt
now
fully
able
to
afford
;
*NL*
he
felt
able
to
travel
as
people
should
,
without
any
thought
of
small
*NL*
economies
--
thanks
to
his
recent
speculations
in
Wall
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
to
her
surprise
she
received
a
note
from
Arobin
,
written
at
*NL*
midnight
from
the
club
.
It
was
to
say
good
morning
to
her
,
to
hope
she
*NL*
had
slept
well
,
to
assure
her
of
his
devotion
,
which
he
trusted
she
in
*NL*
some
faintest
manner
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
letters
were
pleasing
to
her
.
She
answered
the
children
in
a
*NL*
cheerful
frame
of
mind
,
promising
them
bonbons
,
and
congratulating
them
*NL*
upon
their
happy
find
of
the
little
pigs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
her
husband
with
friendly
evasiveness
,
--
not
with
any
fixed
*NL*
design
to
mislead
him
,
only
because
all
sense
of
reality
had
gone
out
*NL*
of
her
life
;
she
had
abandoned
herself
to
Fate
,
and
awaited
the
*NL*
consequences
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Arobin
's
note
she
made
no
reply
.
She
put
it
under
Celestine
's
*NL*
stove-lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
worked
several
hours
with
much
spirit
.
She
saw
no
one
but
a
picture
*NL*
dealer
,
who
asked
her
if
it
were
true
that
she
was
going
abroad
to
study
*NL*
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
possibly
she
might
,
and
he
negotiated
with
her
for
some
*NL*
Parisian
studies
to
reach
him
in
time
for
the
holiday
trade
in
December
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
did
not
come
that
day
.
She
was
keenly
disappointed
.
He
did
not
*NL*
come
the
following
day
,
nor
the
next
.
Each
morning
she
awoke
with
hope
,
*NL*
and
each
night
she
was
a
prey
to
despondency
.
She
was
tempted
to
seek
*NL*
him
out
.
But
far
from
yielding
to
the
impulse
,
she
avoided
any
occasion
*NL*
which
might
throw
her
in
his
way
.
She
did
not
go
to
Mademoiselle
Reisz
's
*NL*
nor
pass
by
Madame
Lebrun
's
,
as
she
might
have
done
if
he
had
still
been
*NL*
in
Mexico
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Arobin
,
one
night
,
urged
her
to
drive
with
him
,
she
went
--
out
to
*NL*
the
lake
,
on
the
Shell
Road
.
His
horses
were
full
of
mettle
,
and
even
a
*NL*
little
unmanageable
.
She
liked
the
rapid
gait
at
which
they
spun
along
,
*NL*
and
the
quick
,
sharp
sound
of
the
horses
'
hoofs
on
the
hard
road
.
They
*NL*
did
not
stop
anywhere
to
eat
or
to
drink
.
Arobin
was
not
needlessly
*NL*
imprudent
.
But
they
ate
and
they
drank
when
they
regained
Edna
's
little
*NL*
dining-room
--
which
was
comparatively
early
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
late
when
he
left
her
.
It
was
getting
to
be
more
than
a
passing
*NL*
whim
with
Arobin
to
see
her
and
be
with
her
.
He
had
detected
the
latent
*NL*
sensuality
,
which
unfolded
under
his
delicate
sense
of
her
nature
's
*NL*
requirements
like
a
torpid
,
torrid
,
sensitive
blossom
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
despondency
when
she
fell
asleep
that
night
;
nor
was
there
*NL*
hope
when
she
awoke
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
garden
out
in
the
suburbs
;
a
small
,
leafy
corner
,
with
a
*NL*
few
green
tables
under
the
orange
trees
.
An
old
cat
slept
all
day
on
the
*NL*
stone
step
in
the
sun
,
and
an
old
mulatresse
slept
her
idle
hours
away
*NL*
in
her
chair
at
the
open
window
,
till
some
one
happened
to
knock
on
one
*NL*
of
the
green
tables
.
She
had
milk
and
cream
cheese
to
sell
,
and
bread
*NL*
and
butter
.
There
was
no
one
who
could
make
such
excellent
coffee
or
fry
*NL*
a
chicken
so
golden
brown
as
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
too
modest
to
attract
the
attention
of
people
of
fashion
,
*NL*
and
so
quiet
as
to
have
escaped
the
notice
of
those
in
search
of
*NL*
pleasure
and
dissipation
.
Edna
had
discovered
it
accidentally
one
day
*NL*
when
the
high-board
gate
stood
ajar
.
She
caught
sight
of
a
little
green
*NL*
table
,
blotched
with
the
checkered
sunlight
that
filtered
through
*NL*
the
quivering
leaves
overhead
.
Within
she
had
found
the
slumbering
*NL*
mulatresse
,
the
drowsy
cat
,
and
a
glass
of
milk
which
reminded
her
of
*NL*
the
milk
she
had
tasted
in
Iberville
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
stopped
there
during
her
perambulations
;
sometimes
taking
a
*NL*
book
with
her
,
and
sitting
an
hour
or
two
under
the
trees
when
she
found
*NL*
the
place
deserted
.
Once
or
twice
she
took
a
quiet
dinner
there
alone
,
*NL*
having
instructed
Celestine
beforehand
to
prepare
no
dinner
at
home
.
It
*NL*
was
the
last
place
in
the
city
where
she
would
have
expected
to
meet
any
*NL*
one
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
was
not
astonished
when
,
as
she
was
partaking
of
a
modest
*NL*
dinner
late
in
the
afternoon
,
looking
into
an
open
book
,
stroking
the
*NL*
cat
,
which
had
made
friends
with
her
--
she
was
not
greatly
astonished
to
*NL*
see
Robert
come
in
at
the
tall
garden
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
destined
to
see
you
only
by
accident
,
''
she
said
,
shoving
the
*NL*
cat
off
the
chair
beside
her
.
He
was
surprised
,
ill
at
ease
,
almost
*NL*
embarrassed
at
meeting
her
thus
so
unexpectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
come
here
often
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
almost
live
here
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
drop
in
very
often
for
a
cup
of
Catiche
's
good
coffee
.
This
*NL*
is
the
first
time
since
I
came
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
bring
you
a
plate
,
and
you
will
share
my
dinner
.
There
's
always
*NL*
enough
for
two
--
even
three
.
''
Edna
had
intended
to
be
indifferent
and
as
*NL*
reserved
as
he
when
she
met
him
;
she
had
reached
the
determination
by
a
*NL*
laborious
train
of
reasoning
,
incident
to
one
of
her
despondent
moods
.
*NL*
But
her
resolve
melted
when
she
saw
him
before
designing
Providence
had
*NL*
led
him
into
her
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
kept
away
from
me
,
Robert
?
''
she
asked
,
closing
the
book
*NL*
that
lay
open
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
personal
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
?
Why
do
you
force
me
to
*NL*
idiotic
subterfuges
?
''
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
warmth
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
there
's
no
use
telling
you
I
've
been
very
busy
,
or
that
I
've
been
sick
,
*NL*
or
that
I
've
been
to
see
you
and
not
found
you
at
home
.
Please
let
me
*NL*
off
with
any
one
of
these
excuses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
embodiment
of
selfishness
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
save
yourself
*NL*
something
--
I
do
n't
know
what
--
but
there
is
some
selfish
motive
,
and
in
*NL*
sparing
yourself
you
never
consider
for
a
moment
what
I
think
,
or
how
*NL*
I
feel
your
neglect
and
indifference
.
I
suppose
this
is
what
you
would
*NL*
call
unwomanly
;
but
I
have
got
into
a
habit
of
expressing
myself
.
It
*NL*
does
n't
matter
to
me
,
and
you
may
think
me
unwomanly
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
only
think
you
cruel
,
as
I
said
the
other
day
.
Maybe
not
*NL*
intentionally
cruel
;
but
you
seem
to
be
forcing
me
into
disclosures
*NL*
which
can
result
in
nothing
;
as
if
you
would
have
me
bare
a
wound
for
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
it
,
without
the
intention
or
power
of
healing
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
spoiling
your
dinner
,
Robert
;
never
mind
what
I
say
.
You
have
n't
*NL*
eaten
a
morsel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
came
in
for
a
cup
of
coffee
.
''
His
sensitive
face
was
all
*NL*
disfigured
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
this
a
delightful
place
?
''
she
remarked
.
``
I
am
so
glad
it
has
*NL*
never
actually
been
discovered
.
It
is
so
quiet
,
so
sweet
,
here
.
Do
you
*NL*
notice
there
is
scarcely
a
sound
to
be
heard
?
It
's
so
out
of
the
way
;
*NL*
and
a
good
walk
from
the
car
.
However
,
I
do
n't
mind
walking
.
I
always
*NL*
feel
so
sorry
for
women
who
do
n't
like
to
walk
;
they
miss
so
much
--
so
*NL*
many
rare
little
glimpses
of
life
;
and
we
women
learn
so
little
of
life
*NL*
on
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catiche
's
coffee
is
always
hot
.
I
do
n't
know
how
she
manages
it
,
here
*NL*
in
the
open
air
.
Celestine
's
coffee
gets
cold
bringing
it
from
the
*NL*
kitchen
to
the
dining-room
.
Three
lumps
!
How
can
you
drink
it
so
sweet
?
*NL*
Take
some
of
the
cress
with
your
chop
;
it
's
so
biting
and
crisp
.
Then
*NL*
there
's
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
smoke
with
your
coffee
out
here
.
*NL*
Now
,
in
the
city
--
are
n't
you
going
to
smoke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
a
while
,
''
he
said
,
laying
a
cigar
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
gave
it
to
you
?
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bought
it
.
I
suppose
I
'm
getting
reckless
;
I
bought
a
whole
box
.
''
She
*NL*
was
determined
not
to
be
personal
again
and
make
him
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cat
made
friends
with
him
,
and
climbed
into
his
lap
when
he
smoked
*NL*
his
cigar
.
He
stroked
her
silky
fur
,
and
talked
a
little
about
her
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
Edna
's
book
,
which
he
had
read
;
and
he
told
her
the
end
,
to
*NL*
save
her
the
trouble
of
wading
through
it
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
accompanied
her
back
to
her
home
;
and
it
was
after
dusk
when
*NL*
they
reached
the
little
``
pigeon-house
.
''
She
did
not
ask
him
to
remain
,
*NL*
which
he
was
grateful
for
,
as
it
permitted
him
to
stay
without
the
*NL*
discomfort
of
blundering
through
an
excuse
which
he
had
no
intention
*NL*
of
considering
.
He
helped
her
to
light
the
lamp
;
then
she
went
into
her
*NL*
room
to
take
off
her
hat
and
to
bathe
her
face
and
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
back
Robert
was
not
examining
the
pictures
and
magazines
*NL*
as
before
;
he
sat
off
in
the
shadow
,
leaning
his
head
back
on
the
chair
*NL*
as
if
in
a
reverie
.
Edna
lingered
a
moment
beside
the
table
,
arranging
*NL*
the
books
there
.
Then
she
went
across
the
room
to
where
he
sat
.
She
bent
*NL*
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
called
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Robert
,
''
she
said
,
``
are
you
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
,
looking
up
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
over
and
kissed
him
--
a
soft
,
cool
,
delicate
kiss
,
whose
*NL*
voluptuous
sting
penetrated
his
whole
being-then
she
moved
away
from
*NL*
him
.
He
followed
,
and
took
her
in
his
arms
,
just
holding
her
close
to
*NL*
him
.
She
put
her
hand
up
to
his
face
and
pressed
his
cheek
against
her
*NL*
own
.
The
action
was
full
of
love
and
tenderness
.
He
sought
her
lips
*NL*
again
.
Then
he
drew
her
down
upon
the
sofa
beside
him
and
held
her
hand
*NL*
in
both
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
now
you
know
what
I
have
been
fighting
against
*NL*
since
last
summer
at
Grand
Isle
;
what
drove
me
away
and
drove
me
back
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
been
fighting
against
it
?
''
she
asked
.
Her
face
glowed
with
*NL*
soft
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Because
you
were
not
free
;
you
were
Leonce
Pontellier
's
wife
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
help
loving
you
if
you
were
ten
times
his
wife
;
but
so
long
as
*NL*
I
went
away
from
you
and
kept
away
I
could
help
telling
you
so
.
''
She
put
*NL*
her
free
hand
up
to
his
shoulder
,
and
then
against
his
cheek
,
rubbing
it
*NL*
softly
.
He
kissed
her
again
.
His
face
was
warm
and
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
in
Mexico
I
was
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
,
and
longing
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
writing
to
me
,
''
she
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
put
into
my
head
that
you
cared
for
me
;
and
I
lost
my
senses
.
*NL*
I
forgot
everything
but
a
wild
dream
of
your
some
way
becoming
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Religion
,
loyalty
,
everything
would
give
way
if
only
you
cared

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
have
forgotten
that
I
was
Leonce
Pontellier
's
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
was
demented
,
dreaming
of
wild

impossible
things

recalling
men

wives
free

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
When

here

never

She
was
still
caressing
his
*NL*
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
realized
what
a
cur
I
was
to
dream

such
a
thing

even
if

been
willing

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
face
between
her
hands
and
looked
into
it
as
if
she
would
*NL*
never
withdraw
her
eyes
more
.
She
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
,
the
eyes
,
*NL*
the
cheeks
,
and
the
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

impossible

I
should

both

*NL*
*NL*
His
face
grew
a
little
white
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
Old
Celestine
came
in
to
say
that
Madame
*NL*
Ratignolle
's
servant
had
come
around
the
back
way
with
a
message
that
*NL*
Madame
had
been
taken
sick
and
begged
Mrs.
Pontellier
to
go
to
her
*NL*
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Edna
,
rising
;
``
I
promised
.
Tell
her
yes

to
wait
for
*NL*
me

I
'll
go
back
with
her

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
walk
over
with
you
,
''
offered
Robert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
will
go
with
the
servant
.
''
She
went
into
her
room
to
*NL*
put
on
her
hat
,
and
when
she
came
in
again
she
sat
once
more
upon
the
*NL*
sofa
beside
him
.
He
had
not
stirred
.
She
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
my
sweet
Robert
.
Tell
me
good-by
.
''
He
kissed
her
with
a
degree
*NL*
of
passion
which
had
not
before
entered
into
his
caress
,
and
strained
*NL*
her
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
,
''
she
whispered
,
``
only
you
;
no
one
but
you

It
was
you
who
*NL*
awoke
me
last
summer
out
of

life-long
,
stupid
dream

Oh
!
you
have
made
*NL*
me
so
unhappy
with
your
indifference

Oh

I
have
suffered

suffered

Now
*NL*
you
are
here
we
shall
love
each

We

Nothing

No

me
,
Robert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
;
do
n't
go
!
Oh
!
Edna
,
stay
with
me
,
''
he
pleaded
.
``
Why
should
*NL*
you
go
?
Stay
with
me
,
stay
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
back
as
soon
as
I
can
;
I
shall
find
you
here
.
''
She
buried
*NL*
her
face
in
his
neck
,
and
said
good-by
again
.
Her
seductive
voice
,
*NL*
together
with
his
great
love
for
her
,
had
enthralled
his
senses
,
had
*NL*
deprived
him
of
every
impulse
but
the
longing
to
hold
her
and
keep
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
looked
in
at
the
drug
store
.
Monsieur
Ratignolle
was
putting
up
*NL*
a
mixture
himself
,
very
carefully
,
dropping
a
red
liquid
into
a
tiny
*NL*
glass
.
He
was
grateful
to
Edna
for
having
come
;
her
presence
would
be
*NL*
a
comfort
to
his
wife
.
Madame
Ratignolle
's
sister
,
who
had
always
been
*NL*
with
her
at
such
trying
times
,
had
not
been
able
to
come
up
from
the
*NL*
plantation
,
and
Adele
had
been
inconsolable
until
Mrs.
Pontellier
so
*NL*
kindly
promised
to
come
to
her
.
The
nurse
had
been
with
them
at
night
*NL*
for
the
past
week
,
as
she
lived
a
great
distance
away
.
And
Dr.
Mandelet
*NL*
had
been
coming
and
going
all
the
afternoon
.
They
were
then
looking
for
*NL*
him
any
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
hastened
upstairs
by
a
private
stairway
that
led
from
the
rear
of
*NL*
the
store
to
the
apartments
above
.
The
children
were
all
sleeping
in
a
*NL*
back
room
.
Madame
Ratignolle
was
in
the
salon
,
whither
she
had
strayed
*NL*
in
her
suffering
impatience
.
She
sat
on
the
sofa
,
clad
in
an
ample
*NL*
white
peignoir
,
holding
a
handkerchief
tight
in
her
hand
with
a
nervous
*NL*
clutch
.
Her
face
was
drawn
and
pinched
,
her
sweet
blue
eyes
haggard
and
*NL*
unnatural
.
All
her
beautiful
hair
had
been
drawn
back
and
plaited
.
It
*NL*
lay
in
a
long
braid
on
the
sofa
pillow
,
coiled
like
a
golden
serpent
.
*NL*
The
nurse
,
a
comfortable
looking
Griffe
woman
in
white
apron
and
cap
,
*NL*
was
urging
her
to
return
to
her
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
use
,
there
is
no
use
,
''
she
said
at
once
to
Edna
.
``
We
must
*NL*
get
rid
of
Mandelet
;
he
is
getting
too
old
and
careless
.
He
said
he
*NL*
would
be
here
at
half-past
seven
;
now
it
must
be
eight
.
See
what
time
it
*NL*
is
,
Josephine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
was
possessed
of
a
cheerful
nature
,
and
refused
to
take
any
*NL*
situation
too
seriously
,
especially
a
situation
with
which
she
was
so
*NL*
familiar
.
She
urged
Madame
to
have
courage
and
patience
.
But
Madame
only
*NL*
set
her
teeth
hard
into
her
under
lip
,
and
Edna
saw
the
sweat
gather
*NL*
in
beads
on
her
white
forehead
.
After
a
moment
or
two
she
uttered
a
*NL*
profound
sigh
and
wiped
her
face
with
the
handkerchief
rolled
in
a
*NL*
ball
.
She
appeared
exhausted
.
The
nurse
gave
her
a
fresh
handkerchief
,
*NL*
sprinkled
with
cologne
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
much
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Mandelet
ought
to
be
killed
!
Where
is
*NL*
Alphonse
?
Is
it
possible
I
am
to
be
abandoned
like
this
--
neglected
by
*NL*
every
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neglected
,
indeed
!
''
exclaimed
the
nurse
.
Was
n't
she
there
?
And
here
was
*NL*
Mrs.
Pontellier
leaving
,
no
doubt
,
a
pleasant
evening
at
home
to
devote
*NL*
to
her
?
And
was
n't
Monsieur
Ratignolle
coming
that
very
instant
through
*NL*
the
hall
?
And
Josephine
was
quite
sure
she
had
heard
Doctor
Mandelet
's
*NL*
coupe
.
Yes
,
there
it
was
,
down
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adele
consented
to
go
back
to
her
room
.
She
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
little
*NL*
low
couch
next
to
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Mandelet
paid
no
attention
to
Madame
Ratignolle
's
upbraidings
.
He
*NL*
was
accustomed
to
them
at
such
times
,
and
was
too
well
convinced
of
her
*NL*
loyalty
to
doubt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
glad
to
see
Edna
,
and
wanted
her
to
go
with
him
into
the
salon
*NL*
and
entertain
him
.
But
Madame
Ratignolle
would
not
consent
that
Edna
*NL*
should
leave
her
for
an
instant
.
Between
agonizing
moments
,
she
chatted
*NL*
a
little
,
and
said
it
took
her
mind
off
her
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
began
to
feel
uneasy
.
She
was
seized
with
a
vague
dread
.
Her
own
*NL*
like
experiences
seemed
far
away
,
unreal
,
and
only
half
remembered
.
She
*NL*
recalled
faintly
an
ecstasy
of
pain
,
the
heavy
odor
of
chloroform
,
a
*NL*
stupor
which
had
deadened
sensation
,
and
an
awakening
to
find
a
little
*NL*
new
life
to
which
she
had
given
being
,
added
to
the
great
unnumbered
*NL*
multitude
of
souls
that
come
and
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
wish
she
had
not
come
;
her
presence
was
not
necessary
.
She
*NL*
might
have
invented
a
pretext
for
staying
away
;
she
might
even
invent
a
*NL*
pretext
now
for
going
.
But
Edna
did
not
go
.
With
an
inward
agony
,
with
a
*NL*
flaming
,
outspoken
revolt
against
the
ways
of
Nature
,
she
witnessed
the
*NL*
scene
of
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
stunned
and
speechless
with
emotion
when
later
she
leaned
*NL*
over
her
friend
to
kiss
her
and
softly
say
good-by
.
Adele
,
pressing
her
*NL*
cheek
,
whispered
in
an
exhausted
voice
:
``
Think
of
the
children
,
Edna
.
Oh
*NL*
think
of
the
children
!
Remember
them
!

XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
still
felt
dazed
when
she
got
outside
in
the
open
air
.
The
Doctor
's
*NL*
coupe
had
returned
for
him
and
stood
before
the
porte
cochere
.
She
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
enter
the
coupe
,
and
told
Doctor
Mandelet
she
would
walk
;
*NL*
she
was
not
afraid
,
and
would
go
alone
.
He
directed
his
carriage
to
meet
*NL*
him
at
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
,
and
he
started
to
walk
home
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
--
away
up
,
over
the
narrow
street
between
the
tall
houses
,
the
stars
*NL*
were
blazing
.
The
air
was
mild
and
caressing
,
but
cool
with
the
breath
*NL*
of
spring
and
the
night
.
They
walked
slowly
,
the
Doctor
with
a
heavy
,
*NL*
measured
tread
and
his
hands
behind
him
;
Edna
,
in
an
absent-minded
way
,
*NL*
as
she
had
walked
one
night
at
Grand
Isle
,
as
if
her
thoughts
had
gone
*NL*
ahead
of
her
and
she
was
striving
to
overtake
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
have
been
there
,
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
was
no
*NL*
place
for
you
.
Adele
is
full
of
whims
at
such
times
.
There
were
a
dozen
*NL*
women
she
might
have
had
with
her
,
unimpressionable
women
.
I
felt
that
*NL*
it
was
cruel
,
cruel
.
You
should
n't
have
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
!
''
she
answered
,
indifferently
.
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
matters
*NL*
after
all
.
One
has
to
think
of
the
children
some
time
or
other
;
the
*NL*
sooner
the
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
Leonce
coming
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
soon
.
Some
time
in
March
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
going
abroad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
--
no
,
I
am
not
going
.
I
'm
not
going
to
be
forced
into
doing
*NL*
things
.
I
do
n't
want
to
go
abroad
.
I
want
to
be
let
alone
.
Nobody
has
*NL*
any
right
--
except
children
,
perhaps
--
and
even
then
,
it
seems
to
me
--
or
*NL*
it
did
seem
--
''
She
felt
that
her
speech
was
voicing
the
incoherency
of
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
and
stopped
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
trouble
is
,
''
sighed
the
Doctor
,
grasping
her
meaning
intuitively
,
*NL*
``
that
youth
is
given
up
to
illusions
.
It
seems
to
be
a
provision
of
*NL*
Nature
;
a
decoy
to
secure
mothers
for
the
race
.
And
Nature
takes
no
*NL*
account
of
moral
consequences
,
of
arbitrary
conditions
which
we
create
,
*NL*
and
which
we
feel
obliged
to
maintain
at
any
cost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
``
The
years
that
are
gone
seem
like
dreams
--
if
one
might
*NL*
go
on
sleeping
and
dreaming
--
but
to
wake
up
and
find
--
oh
!
well
!
perhaps
*NL*
it
is
better
to
wake
up
after
all
,
even
to
suffer
,
rather
than
to
remain
*NL*
a
dupe
to
illusions
all
one
's
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
my
dear
child
,
''
said
the
Doctor
at
parting
,
holding
her
*NL*
hand
,
``
you
seem
to
me
to
be
in
trouble
.
I
am
not
going
to
ask
for
your
*NL*
confidence
.
I
will
only
say
that
if
ever
you
feel
moved
to
give
it
to
*NL*
me
,
perhaps
I
might
help
you
.
I
know
I
would
understand
.
And
I
tell
you
*NL*
there
are
not
many
who
would
--
not
many
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
way
I
do
n't
feel
moved
to
speak
of
things
that
trouble
me
.
Do
n't
*NL*
think
I
am
ungrateful
or
that
I
do
n't
appreciate
your
sympathy
.
There
*NL*
are
periods
of
despondency
and
suffering
which
take
possession
of
me
.
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
want
anything
but
my
own
way
.
That
is
wanting
a
good
deal
,
*NL*
of
course
,
when
you
have
to
trample
upon
the
lives
,
the
hearts
,
the
*NL*
prejudices
of
others
--
but
no
matter
--
still
,
I
should
n't
want
to
trample
*NL*
upon
the
little
lives
.
Oh
!
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
saying
,
Doctor
.
Good
*NL*
night
.
Do
n't
blame
me
for
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
blame
you
if

do

come
and
see
me
soon

We
will
talk

of
things
you
never
have
dreamt
of
talking
about
before
.
It
will
do
*NL*
us
both
good
.
I
do
n't
want
you
to
blame
yourself
,
whatever
comes
.
Good
*NL*
night
,
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
herself
in
at
the
gate
,
but
instead
of
entering
she
sat
upon
*NL*
the
step
of
the
porch
.
The
night
was
quiet
and
soothing
.
All
the
tearing
*NL*
emotion
of
the
last
few
hours
seemed
to
fall
away
from
her
like
a
*NL*
somber
,
uncomfortable
garment
,
which
she
had
but
to
loosen
to
be
rid
of
.
*NL*
She
went
back
to
that
hour
before
Adele
had
sent
for
her
;
and
her
senses
*NL*
kindled
afresh
in
thinking
of
Robert
's
words
,
the
pressure
of
his
arms
,
*NL*
and
the
feeling
of
his
lips
upon
her
own
.
She
could
picture
at
that
*NL*
moment
no
greater
bliss
on
earth
than
possession
of
the
beloved
one
.
*NL*
His
expression
of
love
had
already
given
him
to
her
in
part
.
When
she
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
there
at
hand
,
waiting
for
her
,
she
grew
numb
with
*NL*
the
intoxication
of
expectancy
.
It
was
so
late
;
he
would
be
asleep
*NL*
perhaps
.
She
would
awaken
him
with
a
kiss
.
She
hoped
he
would
be
asleep
*NL*
that
she
might
arouse
him
with
her
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
she
remembered
Adele
's
voice
whispering
,
``
Think
of
the
children
;
*NL*
think
of
them
.
''
She
meant
to
think
of
them
;
that
determination
had
*NL*
driven
into
her
soul
like
a
death
wound
--
but
not
to-night
.
To-morrow
*NL*
would
be
time
to
think
of
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robert
was
not
waiting
for
her
in
the
little
parlor
.
He
was
nowhere
at
*NL*
hand
.
The
house
was
empty
.
But
he
had
scrawled
on
a
piece
of
paper
that
*NL*
lay
in
the
lamplight
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
.
Good-by
--
because
I
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
grew
faint
when
she
read
the
words
.
She
went
and
sat
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
Then
she
stretched
herself
out
there
,
never
uttering
a
sound
.
She
did
*NL*
not
sleep
.
She
did
not
go
to
bed
.
The
lamp
sputtered
and
went
out
.
She
*NL*
was
still
awake
in
the
morning
,
when
Celestine
unlocked
the
kitchen
door
*NL*
and
came
in
to
light
the
fire
.

*NL*
*NL*
Victor
,
with
hammer
and
nails
and
scraps
of
scantling
,
was
patching
a
*NL*
corner
of
one
of
the
galleries
.
Mariequita
sat
near
by
,
dangling
her
*NL*
legs
,
watching
him
work
,
and
handing
him
nails
from
the
tool-box
.
The
*NL*
sun
was
beating
down
upon
them
.
The
girl
had
covered
her
head
with
her
*NL*
apron
folded
into
a
square
pad
.
They
had
been
talking
for
an
hour
or
*NL*
more
.
She
was
never
tired
of
hearing
Victor
describe
the
dinner
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Pontellier
's
.
He
exaggerated
every
detail
,
making
it
appear
a
veritable
*NL*
Lucullean
feast
.
The
flowers
were
in
tubs
,
he
said
.
The
champagne
was
*NL*
quaffed
from
huge
golden
goblets
.
Venus
rising
from
the
foam
could
have
*NL*
presented
no
more
entrancing
a
spectacle
than
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
blazing
*NL*
with
beauty
and
diamonds
at
the
head
of
the
board
,
while
the
other
women
*NL*
were
all
of
them
youthful
houris
,
possessed
of
incomparable
charms
.
She
*NL*
got
it
into
her
head
that
Victor
was
in
love
with
Mrs.
Pontellier
,
and
*NL*
he
gave
her
evasive
answers
,
framed
so
as
to
confirm
her
belief
.
She
*NL*
grew
sullen
and
cried
a
little
,
threatening
to
go
off
and
leave
him
to
*NL*
his
fine
ladies
.
There
were
a
dozen
men
crazy
about
her
at
the
Cheniere
;
*NL*
and
since
it
was
the
fashion
to
be
in
love
with
married
people
,
why
,
she
*NL*
could
run
away
any
time
she
liked
to
New
Orleans
with
Celina
's
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Celina
's
husband
was
a
fool
,
a
coward
,
and
a
pig
,
and
to
prove
it
to
*NL*
her
,
Victor
intended
to
hammer
his
head
into
a
jelly
the
next
time
he
*NL*
encountered
him
.
This
assurance
was
very
consoling
to
Mariequita
.
She
*NL*
dried
her
eyes
,
and
grew
cheerful
at
the
prospect
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
still
talking
of
the
dinner
and
the
allurements
of
city
life
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Pontellier
herself
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
house
.
The
*NL*
two
youngsters
stayed
dumb
with
amazement
before
what
they
considered
*NL*
to
be
an
apparition
.
But
it
was
really
she
in
flesh
and
blood
,
looking
*NL*
tired
and
a
little
travel-stained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
walked
up
from
the
wharf
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
heard
the
hammering
.
I
*NL*
supposed
it
was
you
,
mending
the
porch
.
It
's
a
good
thing
.
I
was
always
*NL*
tripping
over
those
loose
planks
last
summer
.
How
dreary
and
deserted
*NL*
everything
looks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
Victor
some
little
time
to
comprehend
that
she
had
come
in
*NL*
Beaudelet
's
lugger
,
that
she
had
come
alone
,
and
for
no
purpose
but
to
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
fixed
up
yet
,
you
see
.
I
'll
give
you
my
room
;
it
's
the
*NL*
only
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
corner
will
do
,
''
she
assured
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
can
stand
Philomel
's
cooking
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
though
I
might
*NL*
try
to
get
her
mother
while
you
are
here
.
Do
you
think
she
would
come
?
''
*NL*
turning
to
Mariequita
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mariequita
thought
that
perhaps
Philomel
's
mother
might
come
for
a
few
*NL*
days
,
and
money
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beholding
Mrs.
Pontellier
make
her
appearance
,
the
girl
had
at
once
*NL*
suspected
a
lovers
'
rendezvous
.
But
Victor
's
astonishment
was
so
*NL*
genuine
,
and
Mrs.
Pontellier
's
indifference
so
apparent
,
that
the
*NL*
disturbing
notion
did
not
lodge
long
in
her
brain
.
She
contemplated
with
*NL*
the
greatest
interest
this
woman
who
gave
the
most
sumptuous
dinners
in
*NL*
America
,
and
who
had
all
the
men
in
New
Orleans
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
will
you
have
dinner
?
''
asked
Edna
.
``
I
'm
very
hungry
;
but
*NL*
do
n't
get
anything
extra
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
it
ready
in
little
or
no
time
,
''
he
said
,
bustling
and
packing
*NL*
away
his
tools
.
``
You
may
go
to
my
room
to
brush
up
and
rest
yourself
.
*NL*
Mariequita
will
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Edna
.
``
But
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
a
notion
to
go
down
to
*NL*
the
beach
and
take
a
good
wash
and
even
a
little
swim
,
before
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
water
is
too
cold
!
''
they
both
exclaimed
.
``
Do
n't
think
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
might
go
down
and
try
--
dip
my
toes
in
.
Why
,
it
seems
to
me
the
*NL*
sun
is
hot
enough
to
have
warmed
the
very
depths
of
the
ocean
.
Could
you
*NL*
get
me
a
couple
of
towels
?
I
'd
better
go
right
away
,
so
as
to
be
back
in
*NL*
time
.
It
would
be
a
little
too
chilly
if
I
waited
till
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mariequita
ran
over
to
Victor
's
room
,
and
returned
with
some
towels
,
*NL*
which
she
gave
to
Edna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
have
fish
for
dinner
,
''
said
Edna
,
as
she
started
to
walk
*NL*
away
;
``
but
do
n't
do
anything
extra
if
you
have
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
and
find
Philomel
's
mother
,
''
Victor
instructed
the
girl
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
go
to
the
kitchen
and
see
what
I
can
do
.
By
Gimminy
!
Women
have
no
*NL*
consideration
!
She
might
have
sent
me
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
walked
on
down
to
the
beach
rather
mechanically
,
not
noticing
*NL*
anything
special
except
that
the
sun
was
hot
.
She
was
not
dwelling
upon
*NL*
any
particular
train
of
thought
.
She
had
done
all
the
thinking
which
was
*NL*
necessary
after
Robert
went
away
,
when
she
lay
awake
upon
the
sofa
till
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
said
over
and
over
to
herself
:
``
To-day
it
is
Arobin
;
to-morrow
*NL*
it
will
be
some
one
else
.
It
makes
no
difference
to
me
,
it
does
n't
*NL*
matter
about
Leonce
Pontellier
--
but
Raoul
and
Etienne
!
''
She
understood
*NL*
now
clearly
what
she
had
meant
long
ago
when
she
said
to
Adele
*NL*
Ratignolle
that
she
would
give
up
the
unessential
,
but
she
would
never
*NL*
sacrifice
herself
for
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despondency
had
come
upon
her
there
in
the
wakeful
night
,
and
had
never
*NL*
lifted
.
There
was
no
one
thing
in
the
world
that
she
desired
.
There
*NL*
was
no
human
being
whom
she
wanted
near
her
except
Robert
;
and
she
even
*NL*
realized
that
the
day
would
come
when
he
,
too
,
and
the
thought
of
*NL*
him
would
melt
out
of
her
existence
,
leaving
her
alone
.
The
children
*NL*
appeared
before
her
like
antagonists
who
had
overcome
her
;
who
had
*NL*
overpowered
and
sought
to
drag
her
into
the
soul
's
slavery
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
her
days
.
But
she
knew
a
way
to
elude
them
.
She
was
not
thinking
of
*NL*
these
things
when
she
walked
down
to
the
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
of
the
Gulf
stretched
out
before
her
,
gleaming
with
the
*NL*
million
lights
of
the
sun
.
The
voice
of
the
sea
is
seductive
,
never
*NL*
ceasing
,
whispering
,
clamoring
,
murmuring
,
inviting
the
soul
to
wander
*NL*
in
abysses
of
solitude
.
All
along
the
white
beach
,
up
and
down
,
there
*NL*
was
no
living
thing
in
sight
.
A
bird
with
a
broken
wing
was
beating
*NL*
the
air
above
,
reeling
,
fluttering
,
circling
disabled
down
,
down
to
the
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edna
had
found
her
old
bathing
suit
still
hanging
,
faded
,
upon
its
*NL*
accustomed
peg
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
it
on
,
leaving
her
clothing
in
the
bath-house
.
But
when
she
*NL*
was
there
beside
the
sea
,
absolutely
alone
,
she
cast
the
unpleasant
,
*NL*
pricking
garments
from
her
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
stood
*NL*
naked
in
the
open
air
,
at
the
mercy
of
the
sun
,
the
breeze
that
beat
*NL*
upon
her
,
and
the
waves
that
invited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
strange
and
awful
it
seemed
to
stand
naked
under
the
sky
!
how
*NL*
delicious
!
She
felt
like
some
new-born
creature
,
opening
its
eyes
in
a
*NL*
familiar
world
that
it
had
never
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
foamy
wavelets
curled
up
to
her
white
feet
,
and
coiled
like
serpents
*NL*
about
her
ankles
.
She
walked
out
.
The
water
was
chill
,
but
she
walked
*NL*
on
.
The
water
was
deep
,
but
she
lifted
her
white
body
and
reached
*NL*
out
with
a
long
,
sweeping
stroke
.
The
touch
of
the
sea
is
sensuous
,
*NL*
enfolding
the
body
in
its
soft
,
close
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
and
on
.
She
remembered
the
night
she
swam
far
out
,
and
*NL*
recalled
the
terror
that
seized
her
at
the
fear
of
being
unable
to
*NL*
regain
the
shore
.
She
did
not
look
back
now
,
but
went
on
and
on
,
*NL*
thinking
of
the
blue-grass
meadow
that
she
had
traversed
when
a
little
*NL*
child
,
believing
that
it
had
no
beginning
and
no
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
arms
and
legs
were
growing
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
of
Leonce
and
the
children
.
They
were
a
part
of
her
life
.
*NL*
But
they
need
not
have
thought
that
they
could
possess
her
,
body
and
*NL*
soul
.
How
Mademoiselle
Reisz
would
have
laughed
,
perhaps
sneered
,
if
she
*NL*
knew
!
``
And
you
call
yourself
an
artist
!
What
pretensions
,
Madame
!
The
*NL*
artist
must
possess
the
courageous
soul
that
dares
and
defies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Exhaustion
was
pressing
upon
and
overpowering
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
--
because
I
love
you
.
''
He
did
not
know
;
he
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
He
would
never
understand
.
Perhaps
Doctor
Mandelet
would
have
understood
*NL*
if
she
had
seen
him
--
but
it
was
too
late
;
the
shore
was
far
behind
her
,
*NL*
and
her
strength
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
into
the
distance
,
and
the
old
terror
flamed
up
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
then
sank
again
.
Edna
heard
her
father
's
voice
and
her
sister
*NL*
Margaret
's
.
She
heard
the
barking
of
an
old
dog
that
was
chained
to
the
*NL*
sycamore
tree
.
The
spurs
of
the
cavalry
officer
clanged
as
he
walked
*NL*
across
the
porch
.
There
was
the
hum
of
bees
,
and
the
musky
odor
of
pinks
*NL*
filled
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*****
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BEYOND
THE
BAYOU
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
bayou
curved
like
a
crescent
around
the
point
of
land
on
which
La
*NL*
Folle
's
cabin
stood
.
Between
the
stream
and
the
hut
lay
a
big
abandoned
*NL*
field
,
where
cattle
were
pastured
when
the
bayou
supplied
them
with
*NL*
water
enough
.
Through
the
woods
that
spread
back
into
unknown
regions
*NL*
the
woman
had
drawn
an
imaginary
line
,
and
past
this
circle
she
never
*NL*
stepped
.
This
was
the
form
of
her
only
mania
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
a
large
,
gaunt
black
woman
,
past
thirty-five
.
Her
real
name
*NL*
was
Jacqueline
,
but
every
one
on
the
plantation
called
her
La
Folle
,
*NL*
because
in
childhood
she
had
been
frightened
literally
``
out
of
her
*NL*
senses
,
''
and
had
never
wholly
regained
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
when
there
had
been
skirmishing
and
sharpshooting
all
day
in
the
*NL*
woods
.
Evening
was
near
when
P'tit
Maitre
,
black
with
powder
and
crimson
*NL*
with
blood
,
had
staggered
into
the
cabin
of
Jacqueline
's
mother
,
his
*NL*
pursuers
close
at
his
heels
.
The
sight
had
stunned
her
childish
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dwelt
alone
in
her
solitary
cabin
,
for
the
rest
of
the
quarters
had
*NL*
long
since
been
removed
beyond
her
sight
and
knowledge
.
She
had
more
*NL*
physical
strength
than
most
men
,
and
made
her
patch
of
cotton
and
corn
*NL*
and
tobacco
like
the
best
of
them
.
But
of
the
world
beyond
the
bayou
she
*NL*
had
long
known
nothing
,
save
what
her
morbid
fancy
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
at
Bellissime
had
grown
used
to
her
and
her
way
,
and
they
thought
*NL*
nothing
of
it
.
Even
when
``
Old
Mis
'
''
died
,
they
did
not
wonder
that
La
*NL*
Folle
had
not
crossed
the
bayou
,
but
had
stood
upon
her
side
of
it
,
*NL*
wailing
and
lamenting
.
*NL*
*NL*
P'tit
Maitre
was
now
the
owner
of
Bellissime
.
He
was
a
middle-aged
man
,
*NL*
with
a
family
of
beautiful
daughters
about
him
,
and
a
little
son
whom
La
*NL*
Folle
loved
as
if
he
had
been
her
own
.
She
called
him
Cheri
,
and
so
did
*NL*
every
one
else
because
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
girls
had
ever
been
to
her
what
Cheri
was
.
They
had
each
*NL*
and
all
loved
to
be
with
her
,
and
to
listen
to
her
wondrous
stories
of
*NL*
things
that
always
happened
``
yonda
,
beyon
'
de
bayou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
none
of
them
had
stroked
her
black
hand
quite
as
Cheri
did
,
nor
*NL*
rested
their
heads
against
her
knee
so
confidingly
,
nor
fallen
asleep
in
*NL*
her
arms
as
he
used
to
do
.
For
Cheri
hardly
did
such
things
now
,
since
*NL*
he
had
become
the
proud
possessor
of
a
gun
,
and
had
had
his
black
curls
*NL*
cut
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
summer
--
the
summer
Cheri
gave
La
Folle
two
black
curls
tied
with
*NL*
a
knot
of
red
ribbon
--
the
water
ran
so
low
in
the
bayou
that
even
the
*NL*
little
children
at
Bellissime
were
able
to
cross
it
on
foot
,
and
the
*NL*
cattle
were
sent
to
pasture
down
by
the
river
.
La
Folle
was
sorry
when
*NL*
they
were
gone
,
for
she
loved
these
dumb
companions
well
,
and
liked
to
*NL*
feel
that
they
were
there
,
and
to
hear
them
browsing
by
night
up
to
her
*NL*
own
enclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
the
fields
were
deserted
.
The
men
had
*NL*
flocked
to
a
neighboring
village
to
do
their
week
's
trading
,
and
the
*NL*
women
were
occupied
with
household
affairs
,
--
La
Folle
as
well
as
the
*NL*
others
.
It
was
then
she
mended
and
washed
her
handful
of
clothes
,
*NL*
scoured
her
house
,
and
did
her
baking
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
last
employment
she
never
forgot
Cheri
.
To-day
she
had
fashioned
*NL*
croquignoles
of
the
most
fantastic
and
alluring
shapes
for
him
.
So
when
*NL*
she
saw
the
boy
come
trudging
across
the
old
field
with
his
gleaming
*NL*
little
new
rifle
on
his
shoulder
,
she
called
out
gayly
to
him
,
``
Cheri
!
*NL*
Cheri
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Cheri
did
not
need
the
summons
,
for
he
was
coming
straight
to
her
.
*NL*
His
pockets
all
bulged
out
with
almonds
and
raisins
and
an
orange
that
*NL*
he
had
secured
for
her
from
the
very
fine
dinner
which
had
been
given
*NL*
that
day
up
at
his
father
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
sunny-faced
youngster
of
ten
.
When
he
had
emptied
his
pockets
,
*NL*
La
Folle
patted
his
round
red
cheek
,
wiped
his
soiled
hands
on
her
*NL*
apron
,
and
smoothed
his
hair
.
Then
she
watched
him
as
,
with
his
cakes
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
he
crossed
her
strip
of
cotton
back
of
the
cabin
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
into
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
boasted
of
the
things
he
was
going
to
do
with
his
gun
out
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
they
got
plenty
deer
in
the
wood
,
La
Folle
?
''
he
had
inquired
,
*NL*
with
the
calculating
air
of
an
experienced
hunter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Non
,
non
!
''
the
woman
laughed
.
``
Do
n't
you
look
fo
'
no
deer
,
Cheri
.
Dat
's
*NL*
too
big
.
But

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One

I
'll
bring
you

`
an
one

La

''
he
*NL*
had
boasted
pompously
as
he
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
woman
,
an
hour
later
,
heard
the
report
of
the
boy
's
rifle
close
*NL*
to
the
wood
's
edge
,
she
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
if
a
sharp
cry
*NL*
of
distress
had
not
followed
the
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
withdrew
her
arms
from
the
tub
of
suds
in
which
they
had
been
*NL*
plunged
,
dried
them
upon
her
apron
,
and
as
quickly
as
her
trembling
*NL*
limbs
would
bear
her
,
hurried
to
the
spot
whence
the
ominous
report
had
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
she
feared
.
There
she
found
Cheri
stretched
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
with
his
rifle
beside
him
.
He
moaned
piteously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
dead
,
La
Folle
!
I
'm
dead
!
I
'm
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Non
,
non
!
''
she
exclaimed
resolutely
,
as
she
knelt
beside
him
.
``
Put
you
'
*NL*
arm
`
roun
'
La
Folle

.
Dat

.
''
*NL*
She
lifted
him
in
her
powerful
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cheri
had
carried
his
gun
muzzle-downward
.
He
had
stumbled
,
--
he
did
not
*NL*
know
how
.
He
only
knew
that
he
had
a
ball
lodged
somewhere
in
his
leg
,
*NL*
and
he
thought
that
his
end
was
at
hand
.
Now
,
with
his
head
upon
the
*NL*
woman
's
shoulder
,
he
moaned
and
wept
with
pain
and
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
La
Folle
!
La
Folle
!
it
hurt
so
bad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

,
mon

''
the
woman
spoke
soothingly
*NL*
as
she
covered
the
ground
with
long
strides
.
``
La
Folle

'

*NL*
Doctor
Bonfils

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reached
the
abandoned
field
.
As
she
crossed
it
with
her
precious
*NL*
burden
,
she
looked
constantly
and
restlessly
from
side
to
side
.
A
*NL*
terrible
fear
was
upon
her
,
--
the
fear
of
the
world
beyond
the
bayou
,
the
*NL*
morbid
and
insane
dread
she
had
been
under
since
childhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
at
the
bayou
's
edge
she
stood
there
,
and
shouted
for
help
*NL*
as
if
a
life
depended
upon
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
P'tit
Maitre
!
P'tit
Maitre
!
Venez
donc
!
Au
secours
!
Au
secours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
voice
responded
.
Cheri
's
hot
tears
were
scalding
her
neck
.
She
called
*NL*
for
each
and
every
one
upon
the
place
,
and
still
no
answer
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shouted
,
she
wailed
;
but
whether
her
voice
remained
unheard
or
*NL*
unheeded
,
no
reply
came
to
her
frenzied
cries
.
And
all
the
while
Cheri
*NL*
moaned
and
wept
and
entreated
to
be
taken
home
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Folle
gave
a
last
despairing
look
around
her
.
Extreme
terror
was
upon
*NL*
her
.
She
clasped
the
child
close
against
her
breast
,
where
he
could
feel
*NL*
her
heart
beat
like
a
muffled
hammer
.
Then
shutting
her
eyes
,
she
ran
*NL*
suddenly
down
the
shallow
bank
of
the
bayou
,
and
never
stopped
till
she
*NL*
had
climbed
the
opposite
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
there
quivering
an
instant
as
she
opened
her
eyes
.
Then
she
*NL*
plunged
into
the
footpath
through
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
no
more
to
Cheri
,
but
muttered
constantly
,
``
Bon
Dieu
,
ayez
*NL*
pitie
La
Folle
!
Bon
Dieu
,
ayez
pitie
moi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instinct
seemed
to
guide
her
.
When
the
pathway
spread
clear
and
smooth
*NL*
enough
before
her
,
she
again
closed
her
eyes
tightly
against
the
sight
*NL*
of
that
unknown
and
terrifying
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
child
,
playing
in
some
weeds
,
caught
sight
of
her
as
she
neared
the
*NL*
quarters
.
The
little
one
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
Folle
!
''
she
screamed
,
in
her
piercing
treble
.
``
La
Folle
done
cross
*NL*
de
bayer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Quickly
the
cry
passed
down
the
line
of
cabins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yonda
,
La
Folle
done
cross
de
bayou
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Children
,
old
men
,
old
women
,
young
ones
with
infants
in
their
arms
,
*NL*
flocked
to
doors
and
windows
to
see
this
awe-inspiring
spectacle
.
Most
*NL*
of
them
shuddered
with
superstitious
dread
of
what
it
might
portend
.
*NL*
``
She
totin
'
Cheri
!
''
some
of
them
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
more
daring
gathered
about
her
,
and
followed
at
her
heels
,
*NL*
only
to
fall
back
with
new
terror
when
she
turned
her
distorted
face
*NL*
upon
them
.
Her
eyes
were
bloodshot
and
the
saliva
had
gathered
in
a
*NL*
white
foam
on
her
black
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
had
run
ahead
of
her
to
where
P'tit
Maitre
sat
with
his
family
*NL*
and
guests
upon
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P'tit
Maitre
!
La
Folle
done
cross
de
bayou
!
Look
her
!
Look
her
yonda
*NL*
totin
'
Cheri
!
''
This
startling
intimation
was
the
first
which
they
had
of
*NL*
the
woman
's
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
near
at
hand
.
She
walked
with
long
strides
.
Her
eyes
were
*NL*
fixed
desperately
before
her
,
and
she
breathed
heavily
,
as
a
tired
ox
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
foot
of
the
stairway
,
which
she
could
not
have
mounted
,
she
laid
*NL*
the
boy
in
his
father
's
arms
.
Then
the
world
that
had
looked
red
to
*NL*
La
Folle
suddenly
turned
black
,
--
like
that
day
she
had
seen
powder
and
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
reeled
for
an
instant
.
Before
a
sustaining
arm
could
reach
her
,
she
*NL*
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
La
Folle
regained
consciousness
,
she
was
at
home
again
,
in
her
own
*NL*
cabin
and
upon
her
own
bed
.
The
moon
rays
,
streaming
in
through
the
open
*NL*
door
and
windows
,
gave
what
light
was
needed
to
the
old
black
mammy
who
*NL*
stood
at
the
table
concocting
a
tisane
of
fragrant
herbs
.
It
was
very
*NL*
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
who
had
come
,
and
found
that
the
stupor
clung
to
her
,
had
gone
*NL*
again
.
P'tit
Maitre
had
been
there
,
and
with
him
Doctor
Bonfils
,
who
*NL*
said
that
La
Folle
might
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
death
had
passed
her
by
.
The
voice
was
very
clear
and
steady
with
*NL*
which
she
spoke
to
Tante
Lizette
,
brewing
her
tisane
there
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ef
you
will
give
me
one
good
drink
tisane
,
Tante
Lizette
,
I
b
`
lieve
I
'm
*NL*
goin
'
sleep
,
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
did
sleep
;
so
soundly
,
so
healthfully
,
that
old
Lizette
without
*NL*
compunction
stole
softly
away
,
to
creep
back
through
the
moonlit
fields
*NL*
to
her
own
cabin
in
the
new
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
touch
of
the
cool
gray
morning
awoke
La
Folle
.
She
arose
,
*NL*
calmly
,
as
if
no
tempest
had
shaken
and
threatened
her
existence
but
*NL*
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
donned
her
new
blue
cottonade
and
white
apron
,
for
she
remembered
*NL*
that
this
was
Sunday
.
When
she
had
made
for
herself
a
cup
of
strong
*NL*
black
coffee
,
and
drunk
it
with
relish
,
she
quitted
the
cabin
and
walked
*NL*
across
the
old
familiar
field
to
the
bayou
's
edge
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
stop
there
as
she
had
always
done
before
,
but
crossed
with
a
*NL*
long
,
steady
stride
as
if
she
had
done
this
all
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
made
her
way
through
the
brush
and
scrub
cottonwood-trees
*NL*
that
lined
the
opposite
bank
,
she
found
herself
upon
the
border
of
a
*NL*
field
where
the
white
,
bursting
cotton
,
with
the
dew
upon
it
,
gleamed
*NL*
for
acres
and
acres
like
frosted
silver
in
the
early
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Folle
drew
a
long
,
deep
breath
as
she
gazed
across
the
country
.
She
*NL*
walked
slowly
and
uncertainly
,
like
one
who
hardly
knows
how
,
looking
*NL*
about
her
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabins
,
that
yesterday
had
sent
a
clamor
of
voices
to
pursue
her
,
*NL*
were
quiet
now
.
No
one
was
yet
astir
at
Bellissime
.
Only
the
birds
that
*NL*
darted
here
and
there
from
hedges
were
awake
,
and
singing
their
matins
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
La
Folle
came
to
the
broad
stretch
of
velvety
lawn
that
surrounded
*NL*
the
house
,
she
moved
slowly
and
with
delight
over
the
springy
turf
,
that
*NL*
was
delicious
beneath
her
tread
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
to
find
whence
came
those
perfumes
that
were
assailing
her
*NL*
senses
with
memories
from
a
time
far
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
were
,
stealing
up
to
her
from
the
thousand
blue
violets
that
*NL*
peeped
out
from
green
,
luxuriant
beds
.
There
they
were
,
showering
down
*NL*
from
the
big
waxen
bells
of
the
magnolias
far
above
her
head
,
and
from
*NL*
the
jessamine
clumps
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
roses
,
too
,
without
number
.
To
right
and
left
palms
spread
*NL*
in
broad
and
graceful
curves
.
It
all
looked
like
enchantment
beneath
the
*NL*
sparkling
sheen
of
dew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
La
Folle
had
slowly
and
cautiously
mounted
the
many
steps
that
led
*NL*
up
to
the
veranda
,
she
turned
to
look
back
at
the
perilous
ascent
she
*NL*
had
made
.
Then
she
caught
sight
of
the
river
,
bending
like
a
silver
bow
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
Bellissime
.
Exultation
possessed
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Folle
rapped
softly
upon
a
door
near
at
hand
.
Cheri
's
mother
*NL*
soon
cautiously
opened
it
.
Quickly
and
cleverly
she
dissembled
the
*NL*
astonishment
she
felt
at
seeing
La
Folle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
La
Folle
!
Is
it
you
,
so
early
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oui

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

Dr.
Bonfils
says
it
will
be
*NL*
nothing

He

now

Will

come
back
when

*NL*
*NL*
``
Non

madame
.
I

.
''
La
Folle
seated
*NL*
herself
upon
the
topmost
step
of
the
veranda
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
look
of
wonder
and
deep
content
crept
into
her
face
as
she
watched
for
*NL*
the
first
time
the
sun
rise
upon
the
new
,
the
beautiful
world
beyond
the
*NL*
bayou
.

MA'AME
PELAGIE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
war
began
,
there
stood
on
Cote
Joyeuse
an
imposing
mansion
*NL*
of
red
brick
,
shaped
like
the
Pantheon
.
A
grove
of
majestic
live-oaks
*NL*
surrounded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirty
years
later
,
only
the
thick
walls
were
standing
,
with
the
dull
*NL*
red
brick
showing
here
and
there
through
a
matted
growth
of
clinging
*NL*
vines
.
The
huge
round
pillars
were
intact
;
so
to
some
extent
was
the
*NL*
stone
flagging
of
hall
and
portico
.
There
had
been
no
home
so
stately
*NL*
along
the
whole
stretch
of
Cote
Joyeuse
.
Every
one
knew
that
,
as
they
*NL*
knew
it
had
cost
Philippe
Valmet
sixty
thousand
dollars
to
build
,
away
*NL*
back
in
1840
.
No
one
was
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
fact
,
so
long
as
*NL*
his
daughter
Pelagie
survived
.
She
was
a
queenly
,
white-haired
woman
of
*NL*
fifty
.
``
Ma'ame
Pelagie
,
''
they
called
her
,
though
she
was
unmarried
,
as
*NL*
was
her
sister
Pauline
,
a
child
in
Ma'ame
Pelagie
's
eyes
;
a
child
of
*NL*
thirty-five
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
lived
alone
in
a
three-roomed
cabin
,
almost
within
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
ruin
.
They
lived
for
a
dream
,
for
Ma'ame
Pelagie
's
dream
,
which
was
*NL*
to
rebuild
the
old
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
pitiful
to
tell
how
their
days
were
spent
to
accomplish
this
*NL*
end
;
how
the
dollars
had
been
saved
for
thirty
years
and
the
picayunes
*NL*
hoarded
;
and
yet
,
not
half
enough
gathered
!
But
Ma'ame
Pelagie
felt
sure
*NL*
of
twenty
years
of
life
before
her
,
and
counted
upon
as
many
more
for
*NL*
her
sister
.
And
what
could
not
come
to
pass
in
twenty
--
in
forty
--
years
?
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
of
pleasant
afternoons
,
the
two
would
drink
their
black
coffee
,
*NL*
seated
upon
the
stone-flagged
portico
whose
canopy
was
the
blue
sky
of
*NL*
Louisiana
.
They
loved
to
sit
there
in
the
silence
,
with
only
each
other
*NL*
and
the
sheeny
,
prying
lizards
for
company
,
talking
of
the
old
times
*NL*
and
planning
for
the
new
;
while
light
breezes
stirred
the
tattered
vines
*NL*
high
up
among
the
columns
,
where
owls
nested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
never
hope
to
have
all
just
as
it
was
,
Pauline
,
''
Ma'ame
Pelagie
*NL*
would
say
;
``
perhaps
the
marble
pillars
of
the
salon
will
have
to
be
*NL*
replaced
by
wooden
ones
,
and
the
crystal
candelabra
left
out
.
Should
you
*NL*
be
willing
,
Pauline
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
Sesoeur
,
I
shall
be
willing
.
''
It
was
always
,
``
Yes
,
Sesoeur
,
''
or
*NL*
``
No
,
Sesoeur
,
''
``
Just
as
you
please
,
Sesoeur
,
''
with
poor
little
Mam
`
selle
*NL*
Pauline
.
For
what
did
she
remember
of
that
old
life
and
that
old
*NL*
spendor
?
Only
a
faint
gleam
here
and
there
;
the
half-consciousness
of
*NL*
a
young
,
uneventful
existence
;
and
then
a
great
crash
.
That
meant
the
*NL*
nearness
of
war
;
the
revolt
of
slaves
;
confusion
ending
in
fire
and
*NL*
flame
through
which
she
was
borne
safely
in
the
strong
arms
of
Pelagie
,
*NL*
and
carried
to
the
log
cabin
which
was
still
their
home
.
Their
brother
,
*NL*
Leandre
,
had
known
more
of
it
all
than
Pauline
,
and
not
so
much
as
*NL*
Pelagie
.
He
had
left
the
management
of
the
big
plantation
with
all
its
*NL*
memories
and
traditions
to
his
older
sister
,
and
had
gone
away
to
dwell
*NL*
in
cities
.
That
was
many
years
ago
.
Now
,
Leandre
's
business
called
him
*NL*
frequently
and
upon
long
journeys
from
home
,
and
his
motherless
daughter
*NL*
was
coming
to
stay
with
her
aunts
at
Cote
Joyeuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
about
it
,
sipping
their
coffee
on
the
ruined
portico
.
*NL*
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
was
terribly
excited
;
the
flush
that
throbbed
into
her
*NL*
pale
,
nervous
face
showed
it
;
and
she
locked
her
thin
fingers
in
and
out
*NL*
incessantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
shall
we
do
with
La
Petite
,
Sesoeur
?
Where
shall
we
put
her
?
*NL*
How
shall
we
amuse
her
?
Ah
,
Seigneur
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
sleep
upon
a
cot
in
the
room
next
to
ours
,
''
responded
Ma'ame
*NL*
Pelagie
,
``
and
live
as
we
do
.
She
knows
how
we
live
,
and
why
we
live
;
her
*NL*
father
has
told
her
.
She
knows
we
have
money
and
could
squander
it
if
we
*NL*
chose
.
Do
not
fret
,
Pauline
;
let
us
hope
La
Petite
is
a
true
Valmet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Ma'ame
Pelagie
rose
with
stately
deliberation
and
went
to
saddle
*NL*
her
horse
,
for
she
had
yet
to
make
her
last
daily
round
through
the
*NL*
fields
;
and
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
threaded
her
way
slowly
among
the
tangled
*NL*
grasses
toward
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coming
of
La
Petite
,
bringing
with
her
as
she
did
the
pungent
*NL*
atmosphere
of
an
outside
and
dimly
known
world
,
was
a
shock
to
these
*NL*
two
,
living
their
dream-life
.
The
girl
was
quite
as
tall
as
her
aunt
*NL*
Pelagie
,
with
dark
eyes
that
reflected
joy
as
a
still
pool
reflects
the
*NL*
light
of
stars
;
and
her
rounded
cheek
was
tinged
like
the
pink
crepe
*NL*
myrtle
.
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
kissed
her
and
trembled
.
Ma'ame
Pelagie
looked
*NL*
into
her
eyes
with
a
searching
gaze
,
which
seemed
to
seek
a
likeness
of
*NL*
the
past
in
the
living
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
made
room
between
them
for
this
young
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
La
Petite
had
determined
upon
trying
to
fit
herself
to
the
strange
,
*NL*
narrow
existence
which
she
knew
awaited
her
at
Cote
Joyeuse
.
It
went
*NL*
well
enough
at
first
.
Sometimes
she
followed
Ma'ame
Pelagie
into
the
*NL*
fields
to
note
how
the
cotton
was
opening
,
ripe
and
white
;
or
to
count
*NL*
the
ears
of
corn
upon
the
hardy
stalks
.
But
oftener
she
was
with
her
*NL*
aunt
Pauline
,
assisting
in
household
offices
,
chattering
of
her
brief
*NL*
past
,
or
walking
with
the
older
woman
arm-in-arm
under
the
trailing
moss
*NL*
of
the
giant
oaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
's
steps
grew
very
buoyant
that
summer
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
were
sometimes
as
bright
as
a
bird
's
,
unless
La
Petite
were
away
*NL*
from
her
side
,
when
they
would
lose
all
other
light
but
one
of
uneasy
*NL*
expectancy
.
The
girl
seemed
to
love
her
well
in
return
,
and
called
her
*NL*
endearingly
Ta
n'tante
.
But
as
the
time
went
by
,
La
Petite
became
very
*NL*
quiet
,
--
not
listless
,
but
thoughtful
,
and
slow
in
her
movements
.
Then
*NL*
her
cheeks
began
to
pale
,
till
they
were
tinged
like
the
creamy
plumes
*NL*
of
the
white
crepe
myrtle
that
grew
in
the
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
she
sat
within
its
shadow
,
between
her
aunts
,
holding
a
*NL*
hand
of
each
,
she
said
:
``
Tante
Pelagie
,
I
must
tell
you
something
,
*NL*
you
and
Ta
n'tante
.
''
She
spoke
low
,
but
clearly
and
firmly
.
``
I
love
you
*NL*
both
,
--
please
remember
that
I
love
you
both
.
But
I
must
go
away
from
*NL*
you
.
I
ca
n't
live
any
longer
here
at
Cote
Joyeuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
spasm
passed
through
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
's
delicate
frame
.
La
Petite
*NL*
could
feel
the
twitch
of
it
in
the
wiry
fingers
that
were
intertwined
*NL*
with
her
own
.
Ma'ame
Pelagie
remained
unchanged
and
motionless
.
No
human
*NL*
eye
could
penetrate
so
deep
as
to
see
the
satisfaction
which
her
soul
*NL*
felt
.
She
said
:
``
What
do
you
mean
,
Petite
?
Your
father
has
sent
you
to
*NL*
us
,
and
I
am
sure
it
is
his
wish
that
you
remain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
loves
me
,
tante
Pelagie
,
and
such
will
not
be
his
wish
when
*NL*
he
knows
.
Oh
!
''
she
continued
with
a
restless
,
movement
,
``
it
is
as
though
*NL*
a
weight
were
pressing
me
backward
here
.
I
must
live
another
life
;
the
*NL*
life
I
lived
before
.
I
want
to
know
things
that
are
happening
from
day
*NL*
to
day
over
the
world
,
and
hear
them
talked
about
.
I
want
my
music
,
*NL*
my
books
,
my
companions
.
If
I
had
known
no
other
life
but
this
one
of
*NL*
privation
,
I
suppose
it
would
be
different
.
If
I
had
to
live
this
life
,
*NL*
I
should
make
the
best
of
it
.
But
I
do
not
have
to
;
and
you
know
,
tante
*NL*
Pelagie
,
you
do
not
need
to
.
It
seems
to
me
,
''
she
added
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
``
that
it
is
a
sin
against
myself
.
Ah
,
Ta
n'tante
!
--
what
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
Ta
n'tante
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nothing
;
only
a
slight
feeling
of
faintness
,
that
would
soon
*NL*
pass
.
She
entreated
them
to
take
no
notice
;
but
they
brought
her
some
*NL*
water
and
fanned
her
with
a
palmetto
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
night
,
in
the
stillness
of
the
room
,
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
sobbed
*NL*
and
would
not
be
comforted
.
Ma'ame
Pelagie
took
her
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pauline
,
my
little
sister
Pauline
,
''
she
entreated
,
``
I
never
have
seen
*NL*
you
like
this
before
.
Do
you
no
longer
love
me
?
Have
we
not
been
happy
*NL*
together
,
you
and
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
Sesoeur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
because
La
Petite
is
going
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Sesoeur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
is
dearer
to
you
than
I
!
''
spoke
Ma'ame
Pelagie
with
sharp
*NL*
resentment
.
``
Than
I
,
who
held
you
and
warmed
you
in
my
arms
the
day
you
*NL*
were
born
;
than
I
,
your
mother
,
father
,
sister
,
everything
that
could
*NL*
cherish
you
.
Pauline
,
do
n't
tell
me
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
tried
to
talk
through
her
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
explain
it
to
you
,
Sesoeur
.
I
do
n't
understand
it
myself
.
I
*NL*
love
you
as
I
have
always
loved
you
;
next
to
God
.
But
if
La
Petite
goes
*NL*
away
I
shall
die
.
I
ca
n't
understand
,
--
help
me
,
Sesoeur
.
She
seems
--
she
*NL*
seems
like
a
saviour
;
like
one
who
had
come
and
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
*NL*
was
leading
me
somewhere-somewhere
I
want
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ma'ame
Pelagie
had
been
sitting
beside
the
bed
in
her
peignoir
and
*NL*
slippers
.
She
held
the
hand
of
her
sister
who
lay
there
,
and
smoothed
*NL*
down
the
woman
's
soft
brown
hair
.
She
said
not
a
word
,
and
the
silence
*NL*
was
broken
only
by
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
's
continued
sobs
.
Once
Ma'ame
*NL*
Pelagie
arose
to
mix
a
drink
of
orange-flower
water
,
which
she
gave
to
*NL*
her
sister
,
as
she
would
have
offered
it
to
a
nervous
,
fretful
child
.
*NL*
Almost
an
hour
passed
before
Ma'ame
Pelagie
spoke
again
.
Then
she
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pauline
,
you
must
cease
that
sobbing
,
now
,
and
sleep
.
You
will
make
*NL*
yourself
ill
.
La
Petite
will
not
go
away
.
Do
you
hear
me
?
Do
you
*NL*
understand
?
She
will
stay
,
I
promise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
could
not
clearly
comprehend
,
but
she
had
great
faith
*NL*
in
the
word
of
her
sister
,
and
soothed
by
the
promise
and
the
touch
of
*NL*
Ma'ame
Pelagie
's
strong
,
gentle
hand
,
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ma'ame
Pelagie
,
when
she
saw
that
her
sister
slept
,
arose
noiselessly
*NL*
and
stepped
outside
upon
the
low-roofed
narrow
gallery
.
She
did
not
*NL*
linger
there
,
but
with
a
step
that
was
hurried
and
agitated
,
she
crossed
*NL*
the
distance
that
divided
her
cabin
from
the
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
not
a
dark
one
,
for
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
moon
*NL*
resplendent
.
But
light
or
dark
would
have
made
no
difference
to
Ma'ame
*NL*
Pelagie
.
It
was
not
the
first
time
she
had
stolen
away
to
the
ruin
at
*NL*
night-time
,
when
the
whole
plantation
slept
;
but
she
never
before
had
*NL*
been
there
with
a
heart
so
nearly
broken
.
She
was
going
there
for
the
*NL*
last
time
to
dream
her
dreams
;
to
see
the
visions
that
hitherto
had
*NL*
crowded
her
days
and
nights
,
and
to
bid
them
farewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
first
of
them
,
awaiting
her
upon
the
very
portal
;
a
robust
*NL*
old
white-haired
man
,
chiding
her
for
returning
home
so
late
.
There
are
*NL*
guests
to
be
entertained
.
Does
she
not
know
it
?
Guests
from
the
city
*NL*
and
from
the
near
plantations
.
Yes
,
she
knows
it
is
late
.
She
had
been
*NL*
abroad
with
Felix
,
and
they
did
not
notice
how
the
time
was
speeding
.
*NL*
Felix
is
there
;
he
will
explain
it
all
.
He
is
there
beside
her
,
but
she
*NL*
does
not
want
to
hear
what
he
will
tell
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ma'ame
Pelagie
had
sunk
upon
the
bench
where
she
and
her
sister
so
*NL*
often
came
to
sit
.
Turning
,
she
gazed
in
through
the
gaping
chasm
of
*NL*
the
window
at
her
side
.
The
interior
of
the
ruin
is
ablaze
.
Not
with
the
*NL*
moonlight
,
for
that
is
faint
beside
the
other
one
--
the
sparkle
from
the
*NL*
crystal
candelabra
,
which
negroes
,
moving
noiselessly
and
respectfully
*NL*
about
,
are
lighting
,
one
after
the
other
.
How
the
gleam
of
them
reflects
*NL*
and
glances
from
the
polished
marble
pillars
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
holds
a
number
of
guests
.
There
is
old
Monsieur
Lucien
Santien
,
*NL*
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
,
and
laughing
at
something
which
*NL*
Monsieur
Lafirme
is
telling
him
,
till
his
fat
shoulders
shake
.
His
*NL*
son
Jules
is
with
him
--
Jules
,
who
wants
to
marry
her
.
She
laughs
.
She
*NL*
wonders
if
Felix
has
told
her
father
yet
.
There
is
young
Jerome
Lafirme
*NL*
playing
at
checkers
upon
the
sofa
with
Leandre
.
Little
Pauline
stands
*NL*
annoying
them
and
disturbing
the
game
.
Leandre
reproves
her
.
She
begins
*NL*
to
cry
,
and
old
black
Clementine
,
her
nurse
,
who
is
not
far
off
,
limps
*NL*
across
the
room
to
pick
her
up
and
carry
her
away
.
How
sensitive
the
*NL*
little
one
is
!
But
she
trots
about
and
takes
care
of
herself
better
than
*NL*
she
did
a
year
or
two
ago
,
when
she
fell
upon
the
stone
hall
floor
*NL*
and
raised
a
great
``
bo-bo
''
on
her
forehead
.
Pelagie
was
hurt
and
angry
*NL*
enough
about
it
;
and
she
ordered
rugs
and
buffalo
robes
to
be
brought
*NL*
and
laid
thick
upon
the
tiles
,
till
the
little
one
's
steps
were
surer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Il
ne
faut
pas
faire
mal
a
Pauline
.
''
She
was
saying
it
aloud
--
``
faire
*NL*
mal
a
Pauline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
gazes
beyond
the
salon
,
back
into
the
big
dining
hall
,
where
*NL*
the
white
crepe
myrtle
grows
.
Ha
!
how
low
that
bat
has
circled
.
It
has
*NL*
struck
Ma'ame
Pelagie
full
on
the
breast
.
She
does
not
know
it
.
She
is
*NL*
beyond
there
in
the
dining
hall
,
where
her
father
sits
with
a
group
*NL*
of
friends
over
their
wine
.
As
usual
they
are
talking
politics
.
How
*NL*
tiresome
!
She
has
heard
them
say
``
la
guerre
''
oftener
than
once
.
La
*NL*
guerre
.
Bah
!
She
and
Felix
have
something
pleasanter
to
talk
about
,
out
*NL*
under
the
oaks
,
or
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
oleanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
right
!
The
sound
of
a
cannon
,
shot
at
Sumter
,
has
rolled
*NL*
across
the
Southern
States
,
and
its
echo
is
heard
along
the
whole
*NL*
stretch
of
Cote
Joyeuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Pelagie
does
not
believe
it
.
Not
till
La
Ricaneuse
stands
before
*NL*
her
with
bare
,
black
arms
akimbo
,
uttering
a
volley
of
vile
abuse
and
*NL*
of
brazen
impudence
.
Pelagie
wants
to
kill
her
.
But
yet
she
will
not
*NL*
believe
.
Not
till
Felix
comes
to
her
in
the
chamber
above
the
dining
*NL*
hall
--
there
where
that
trumpet
vine
hangs
--
comes
to
say
good-by
to
her
.
*NL*
The
hurt
which
the
big
brass
buttons
of
his
new
gray
uniform
pressed
*NL*
into
the
tender
flesh
of
her
bosom
has
never
left
it
.
She
sits
upon
the
*NL*
sofa
,
and
he
beside
her
,
both
speechless
with
pain
.
That
room
would
not
*NL*
have
been
altered
.
Even
the
sofa
would
have
been
there
in
the
same
spot
,
*NL*
and
Ma'ame
Pelagie
had
meant
all
along
,
for
thirty
years
,
all
along
,
to
*NL*
lie
there
upon
it
some
day
when
the
time
came
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
is
no
time
to
weep
,
with
the
enemy
at
the
door
.
The
door
has
*NL*
been
no
barrier
.
They
are
clattering
through
the
halls
now
,
drinking
the
*NL*
wines
,
shattering
the
crystal
and
glass
,
slashing
the
portraits
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
stands
before
her
and
tells
her
to
leave
the
house
.
She
*NL*
slaps
his
face
.
How
the
stigma
stands
out
red
as
blood
upon
his
blanched
*NL*
cheek
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
is
a
roar
of
fire
and
the
flames
are
bearing
down
upon
her
*NL*
motionless
figure
.
She
wants
to
show
them
how
a
daughter
of
Louisiana
*NL*
can
perish
before
her
conquerors
.
But
little
Pauline
clings
to
her
knees
*NL*
in
an
agony
of
terror
.
Little
Pauline
must
be
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Il
ne
faut
pas
faire
mal
a
Pauline
.
''
Again
she
is
saying
it
*NL*
aloud
--
``
faire
mal
a
Pauline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
nearly
spent
;
Ma'ame
Pelagie
had
glided
from
the
bench
*NL*
upon
which
she
had
rested
,
and
for
hours
lay
prone
upon
the
stone
*NL*
flagging
,
motionless
.
When
she
dragged
herself
to
her
feet
it
was
to
*NL*
walk
like
one
in
a
dream
.
About
the
great
,
solemn
pillars
,
one
after
the
*NL*
other
,
she
reached
her
arms
,
and
pressed
her
cheek
and
her
lips
upon
the
*NL*
senseless
brick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
adieu
!
''
whispered
Ma'ame
Pelagie
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
longer
the
moon
to
guide
her
steps
across
the
familiar
*NL*
pathway
to
the
cabin
.
The
brightest
light
in
the
sky
was
Venus
,
that
*NL*
swung
low
in
the
east
.
The
bats
had
ceased
to
beat
their
wings
about
*NL*
the
ruin
.
Even
the
mocking-bird
that
had
warbled
for
hours
in
the
old
*NL*
mulberry-tree
had
sung
himself
asleep
.
That
darkest
hour
before
the
day
*NL*
was
mantling
the
earth
.
Ma'ame
Pelagie
hurried
through
the
wet
,
clinging
*NL*
grass
,
beating
aside
the
heavy
moss
that
swept
across
her
face
,
walking
*NL*
on
toward
the
cabin-toward
Pauline
.
Not
once
did
she
look
back
upon
the
*NL*
ruin
that
brooded
like
a
huge
monster
--
a
black
spot
in
the
darkness
that
*NL*
enveloped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Little
more
than
a
year
later
the
transformation
which
the
old
Valmet
*NL*
place
had
undergone
was
the
talk
and
wonder
of
Cote
Joyeuse
.
One
would
*NL*
have
looked
in
vain
for
the
ruin
;
it
was
no
longer
there
;
neither
was
*NL*
the
log
cabin
.
But
out
in
the
open
,
where
the
sun
shone
upon
it
,
and
the
*NL*
breezes
blew
about
it
,
was
a
shapely
structure
fashioned
from
woods
*NL*
that
the
forests
of
the
State
had
furnished
.
It
rested
upon
a
solid
*NL*
foundation
of
brick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
a
corner
of
the
pleasant
gallery
sat
Leandre
smoking
his
afternoon
*NL*
cigar
,
and
chatting
with
neighbors
who
had
called
.
This
was
to
be
his
*NL*
pied
a
terre
now
;
the
home
where
his
sisters
and
his
daughter
dwelt
.
The
*NL*
laughter
of
young
people
was
heard
out
under
the
trees
,
and
within
the
*NL*
house
where
La
Petite
was
playing
upon
the
piano
.
With
the
enthusiasm
*NL*
of
a
young
artist
she
drew
from
the
keys
strains
that
seemed
marvelously
*NL*
beautiful
to
Mam
`
selle
Pauline
,
who
stood
enraptured
near
her
.
Mam
`
selle
*NL*
Pauline
had
been
touched
by
the
re-creation
of
Valmet
.
Her
cheek
was
as
*NL*
full
and
almost
as
flushed
as
La
Petite
's
.
The
years
were
falling
away
*NL*
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ma'ame
Pelagie
had
been
conversing
with
her
brother
and
his
friends
.
*NL*
Then
she
turned
and
walked
away
;
stopping
to
listen
awhile
to
the
music
*NL*
which
La
Petite
was
making
.
But
it
was
only
for
a
moment
.
She
went
on
*NL*
around
the
curve
of
the
veranda
,
where
she
found
herself
alone
.
She
*NL*
stayed
there
,
erect
,
holding
to
the
banister
rail
and
looking
out
calmly
*NL*
in
the
distance
across
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dressed
in
black
,
with
the
white
kerchief
she
always
wore
folded
*NL*
across
her
bosom
.
Her
thick
,
glossy
hair
rose
like
a
silver
diadem
from
*NL*
her
brow
.
In
her
deep
,
dark
eyes
smouldered
the
light
of
fires
that
*NL*
would
never
flame
.
She
had
grown
very
old
.
Years
instead
of
months
*NL*
seemed
to
have
passed
over
her
since
the
night
she
bade
farewell
to
her
*NL*
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Ma'ame
Pelagie
!
How
could
it
be
different
!
While
the
outward
*NL*
pressure
of
a
young
and
joyous
existence
had
forced
her
footsteps
into
*NL*
the
light
,
her
soul
had
stayed
in
the
shadow
of
the
ruin
.

DESIREE
'S
BABY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
day
was
pleasant
,
Madame
Valmonde
drove
over
to
L'Abri
to
see
*NL*
Desiree
and
the
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
laugh
to
think
of
Desiree
with
a
baby
.
Why
,
it
seemed
*NL*
but
yesterday
that
Desiree
was
little
more
than
a
baby
herself
;
when
*NL*
Monsieur
in
riding
through
the
gateway
of
Valmonde
had
found
her
lying
*NL*
asleep
in
the
shadow
of
the
big
stone
pillar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
one
awoke
in
his
arms
and
began
to
cry
for
``
Dada
.
''
That
*NL*
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
or
say
.
Some
people
thought
she
might
have
*NL*
strayed
there
of
her
own
accord
,
for
she
was
of
the
toddling
age
.
The
*NL*
prevailing
belief
was
that
she
had
been
purposely
left
by
a
party
of
*NL*
Texans
,
whose
canvas-covered
wagon
,
late
in
the
day
,
had
crossed
the
*NL*
ferry
that
Coton
Mais
kept
,
just
below
the
plantation
.
In
time
Madame
*NL*
Valmonde
abandoned
every
speculation
but
the
one
that
Desiree
had
been
*NL*
sent
to
her
by
a
beneficent
Providence
to
be
the
child
of
her
affection
,
*NL*
seeing
that
she
was
without
child
of
the
flesh
.
For
the
girl
grew
to
be
*NL*
beautiful
and
gentle
,
affectionate
and
sincere
,
--
the
idol
of
Valmonde
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
wonder
,
when
she
stood
one
day
against
the
stone
pillar
in
*NL*
whose
shadow
she
had
lain
asleep
,
eighteen
years
before
,
that
Armand
*NL*
Aubigny
riding
by
and
seeing
her
there
,
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
That
was
the
way
all
the
Aubignys
fell
in
love
,
as
if
struck
by
a
pistol
*NL*
shot
.
The
wonder
was
that
he
had
not
loved
her
before
;
for
he
had
known
*NL*
her
since
his
father
brought
him
home
from
Paris
,
a
boy
of
eight
,
after
*NL*
his
mother
died
there
.
The
passion
that
awoke
in
him
that
day
,
when
he
*NL*
saw
her
at
the
gate
,
swept
along
like
an
avalanche
,
or
like
a
prairie
*NL*
fire
,
or
like
anything
that
drives
headlong
over
all
obstacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Valmonde
grew
practical
and
wanted
things
well
considered
:
that
*NL*
is
,
the
girl
's
obscure
origin
.
Armand
looked
into
her
eyes
and
did
not
*NL*
care
.
He
was
reminded
that
she
was
nameless
.
What
did
it
matter
about
a
*NL*
name
when
he
could
give
her
one
of
the
oldest
and
proudest
in
Louisiana
?
*NL*
He
ordered
the
corbeille
from
Paris
,
and
contained
himself
with
what
*NL*
patience
he
could
until
it
arrived
;
then
they
were
married
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Valmonde
had
not
seen
Desiree
and
the
baby
for
four
weeks
.
When
*NL*
she
reached
L'Abri
she
shuddered
at
the
first
sight
of
it
,
as
she
always
*NL*
did
.
It
was
a
sad
looking
place
,
which
for
many
years
had
not
known
the
*NL*
gentle
presence
of
a
mistress
,
old
Monsieur
Aubigny
having
married
and
*NL*
buried
his
wife
in
France
,
and
she
having
loved
her
own
land
too
well
*NL*
ever
to
leave
it
.
The
roof
came
down
steep
and
black
like
a
cowl
,
*NL*
reaching
out
beyond
the
wide
galleries
that
encircled
the
yellow
*NL*
stuccoed
house
.
Big
,
solemn
oaks
grew
close
to
it
,
and
their
*NL*
thick-leaved
,
far-reaching
branches
shadowed
it
like
a
pall
.
Young
*NL*
Aubigny
's
rule
was
a
strict
one
,
too
,
and
under
it
his
negroes
had
*NL*
forgotten
how
to
be
gay
,
as
they
had
been
during
the
old
master
's
*NL*
easy-going
and
indulgent
lifetime
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
mother
was
recovering
slowly
,
and
lay
full
length
,
in
her
soft
*NL*
white
muslins
and
laces
,
upon
a
couch
.
The
baby
was
beside
her
,
upon
her
*NL*
arm
,
where
he
had
fallen
asleep
,
at
her
breast
.
The
yellow
nurse
woman
*NL*
sat
beside
a
window
fanning
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Valmonde
bent
her
portly
figure
over
Desiree
and
kissed
her
,
*NL*
holding
her
an
instant
tenderly
in
her
arms
.
Then
she
turned
to
the
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
the
baby
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
startled
tones
.
French
was
the
*NL*
language
spoken
at
Valmonde
in
those
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
would
be
astonished
,
''
laughed
Desiree
,
``
at
the
way
he
has
*NL*
grown
.
The
little
cochon
de
lait
!
Look
at
his
legs
,
mamma
,
and
his
*NL*
hands
and
fingernails
,
--
real
finger-nails
.
Zandrine
had
to
cut
them
this
*NL*
morning
.
Is
n't
it
true
,
Zandrine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
bowed
her
turbaned
head
majestically
,
``
Mais
si
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
way
he
cries
,
''
went
on
Desiree
,
``
is
deafening
.
Armand
heard
him
*NL*
the
other
day
as
far
away
as
La
Blanche
's
cabin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Valmonde
had
never
removed
her
eyes
from
the
child
.
She
lifted
it
*NL*
and
walked
with
it
over
to
the
window
that
was
lightest
.
She
scanned
the
*NL*
baby
narrowly
,
then
looked
as
searchingly
at
Zandrine
,
whose
face
was
*NL*
turned
to
gaze
across
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
child
has
grown
,
has
changed
,
''
said
Madame
Valmonde
,
slowly
,
*NL*
as
she
replaced
it
beside
its
mother
.
``
What
does
Armand
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Desiree
's
face
became
suffused
with
a
glow
that
was
happiness
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Armand
is
the
proudest
father
in
the
parish
,
I
believe
,
chiefly
*NL*
because
it
is
a
boy
,
to
bear
his
name
;
though
he
says
not
,
--
that
he
*NL*
would
have
loved
a
girl
as
well
.
But
I
know
it
is
n't
true
.
I
know
he
*NL*
says
that
to
please
me
.
And
mamma
,
''
she
added
,
drawing
Madame
Valmonde
's
*NL*
head
down
to
her
,
and
speaking
in
a
whisper
,
``
he
has
n't
punished
one
of
*NL*
them
--
not
one
of
them
--
since
baby
is
born
.
Even
Negrillon
,
who
pretended
*NL*
to
have
burnt
his
leg
that
he
might
rest
from
work
--
he
only
laughed
,
and
*NL*
said
Negrillon
was
a
great
scamp
.
Oh
,
mamma
,
I
'm
so
happy
;
it
frightens
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
Desiree
said
was
true
.
Marriage
,
and
later
the
birth
of
his
son
had
*NL*
softened
Armand
Aubigny
's
imperious
and
exacting
nature
greatly
.
*NL*
This
was
what
made
the
gentle
Desiree
so
happy
,
for
she
loved
him
*NL*
desperately
.
When
he
frowned
she
trembled
,
but
loved
him
.
When
he
*NL*
smiled
,
she
asked
no
greater
blessing
of
God
.
But
Armand
's
dark
,
*NL*
handsome
face
had
not
often
been
disfigured
by
frowns
since
the
day
he
*NL*
fell
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
baby
was
about
three
months
old
,
Desiree
awoke
one
day
to
the
*NL*
conviction
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
menacing
her
peace
.
*NL*
It
was
at
first
too
subtle
to
grasp
.
It
had
only
been
a
disquieting
*NL*
suggestion
;
an
air
of
mystery
among
the
blacks
;
unexpected
visits
from
*NL*
far-off
neighbors
who
could
hardly
account
for
their
coming
.
Then
a
*NL*
strange
,
an
awful
change
in
her
husband
's
manner
,
which
she
dared
not
*NL*
ask
him
to
explain
.
When
he
spoke
to
her
,
it
was
with
averted
eyes
,
from
*NL*
which
the
old
love-light
seemed
to
have
gone
out
.
He
absented
himself
*NL*
from
home
;
and
when
there
,
avoided
her
presence
and
that
of
her
child
,
*NL*
without
excuse
.
And
the
very
spirit
of
Satan
seemed
suddenly
to
take
*NL*
hold
of
him
in
his
dealings
with
the
slaves
.
Desiree
was
miserable
*NL*
enough
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
in
her
room
,
one
hot
afternoon
,
in
her
peignoir
,
listlessly
*NL*
drawing
through
her
fingers
the
strands
of
her
long
,
silky
brown
hair
*NL*
that
hung
about
her
shoulders
.
The
baby
,
half
naked
,
lay
asleep
upon
*NL*
her
own
great
mahogany
bed
,
that
was
like
a
sumptuous
throne
,
with
its
*NL*
satin-lined
half-canopy
.
One
of
La
Blanche
's
little
quadroon
boys
--
half
*NL*
naked
too
--
stood
fanning
the
child
slowly
with
a
fan
of
peacock
*NL*
feathers
.
Desiree
's
eyes
had
been
fixed
absently
and
sadly
upon
the
*NL*
baby
,
while
she
was
striving
to
penetrate
the
threatening
mist
that
she
*NL*
felt
closing
about
her
.
She
looked
from
her
child
to
the
boy
who
stood
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
back
again
;
over
and
over
.
``
Ah
!
''
It
was
a
cry
that
she
*NL*
could
not
help
;
which
she
was
not
conscious
of
having
uttered
.
The
blood
*NL*
turned
like
ice
in
her
veins
,
and
a
clammy
moisture
gathered
upon
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
speak
to
the
little
quadroon
boy
;
but
no
sound
would
come
,
*NL*
at
first
.
When
he
heard
his
name
uttered
,
he
looked
up
,
and
his
mistress
*NL*
was
pointing
to
the
door
.
He
laid
aside
the
great
,
soft
fan
,
and
*NL*
obediently
stole
away
,
over
the
polished
floor
,
on
his
bare
tiptoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stayed
motionless
,
with
gaze
riveted
upon
her
child
,
and
her
face
*NL*
the
picture
of
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
her
husband
entered
the
room
,
and
without
noticing
her
,
went
*NL*
to
a
table
and
began
to
search
among
some
papers
which
covered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Armand
,
''
she
called
to
him
,
in
a
voice
which
must
have
stabbed
him
,
if
*NL*
he
was
human
.
But
he
did
not
notice
.
``
Armand
,
''
she
said
again
.
Then
she
*NL*
rose
and
tottered
towards
him
.
``
Armand
,
''
she
panted
once
more
,
clutching
*NL*
his
arm
,
``
look
at
our
child
.
What
does
it
mean
?
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
coldly
but
gently
loosened
her
fingers
from
about
his
arm
and
thrust
*NL*
the
hand
away
from
him
.
``
Tell
me
what
it
means
!
''
she
cried
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
,
''
he
answered
lightly
,
``
that
the
child
is
not
white
;
it
means
*NL*
that
you
are
not
white
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
conception
of
all
that
this
accusation
meant
for
her
nerved
her
*NL*
with
unwonted
courage
to
deny
it
.
``
It
is
a
lie
;
it
is
not
true
,
I
am
*NL*
white
!
Look
at
my
hair
,
it
is
brown
;
and
my
eyes
are
gray
,
Armand
,
you
*NL*
know
they
are
gray
.
And
my
skin
is
fair
,
''
seizing
his
wrist
.
``
Look
at
my
*NL*
hand
;
whiter
than
yours
,
Armand
,
''
she
laughed
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
white
as
La
Blanche
's
,
''
he
returned
cruelly
;
and
went
away
leaving
*NL*
her
alone
with
their
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
could
hold
a
pen
in
her
hand
,
she
sent
a
despairing
letter
to
*NL*
Madame
Valmonde
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
,
they
tell
me
I
am
not
white
.
Armand
has
told
me
I
am
not
*NL*
white
.
For
God
's
sake
tell
them
it
is
not
true
.
You
must
know
it
is
not
*NL*
true
.
I
shall
die
.
I
must
die
.
I
can
not
be
so
unhappy
,
and
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
that
came
was
brief
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
Desiree
:
Come
home
to
Valmonde
;
back
to
your
mother
who
loves
*NL*
you
.
Come
with
your
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
letter
reached
Desiree
she
went
with
it
to
her
husband
's
study
,
*NL*
and
laid
it
open
upon
the
desk
before
which
he
sat
.
She
was
like
a
stone
*NL*
image
:
silent
,
white
,
motionless
after
she
placed
it
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
he
ran
his
cold
eyes
over
the
written
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
nothing
.
``
Shall
I
go
,
Armand
?
''
she
asked
in
tones
sharp
with
*NL*
agonized
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
want
you
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
Almighty
God
had
dealt
cruelly
and
unjustly
with
him
;
and
*NL*
felt
,
somehow
,
that
he
was
paying
Him
back
in
kind
when
he
stabbed
thus
*NL*
into
his
wife
's
soul
.
Moreover
he
no
longer
loved
her
,
because
of
the
*NL*
unconscious
injury
she
had
brought
upon
his
home
and
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
like
one
stunned
by
a
blow
,
and
walked
slowly
towards
*NL*
the
door
,
hoping
he
would
call
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
Armand
,
''
she
moaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
her
.
That
was
his
last
blow
at
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desiree
went
in
search
of
her
child
.
Zandrine
was
pacing
the
sombre
*NL*
gallery
with
it
.
She
took
the
little
one
from
the
nurse
's
arms
with
no
*NL*
word
of
explanation
,
and
descending
the
steps
,
walked
away
,
under
the
*NL*
live-oak
branches
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
October
afternoon
;
the
sun
was
just
sinking
.
Out
in
the
still
*NL*
fields
the
negroes
were
picking
cotton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desiree
had
not
changed
the
thin
white
garment
nor
the
slippers
which
*NL*
she
wore
.
Her
hair
was
uncovered
and
the
sun
's
rays
brought
a
golden
*NL*
gleam
from
its
brown
meshes
.
She
did
not
take
the
broad
,
beaten
road
*NL*
which
led
to
the
far-off
plantation
of
Valmonde
.
She
walked
across
a
*NL*
deserted
field
,
where
the
stubble
bruised
her
tender
feet
,
so
delicately
*NL*
shod
,
and
tore
her
thin
gown
to
shreds
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
disappeared
among
the
reeds
and
willows
that
grew
thick
along
the
*NL*
banks
of
the
deep
,
sluggish
bayou
;
and
she
did
not
come
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
weeks
later
there
was
a
curious
scene
enacted
at
L'Abri
.
In
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
smoothly
swept
back
yard
was
a
great
bonfire
.
Armand
*NL*
Aubigny
sat
in
the
wide
hallway
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
spectacle
;
*NL*
and
it
was
he
who
dealt
out
to
a
half
dozen
negroes
the
material
which
*NL*
kept
this
fire
ablaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
graceful
cradle
of
willow
,
with
all
its
dainty
furbishings
,
was
*NL*
laid
upon
the
pyre
,
which
had
already
been
fed
with
the
richness
of
a
*NL*
priceless
layette
.
Then
there
were
silk
gowns
,
and
velvet
and
satin
ones
*NL*
added
to
these
;
laces
,
too
,
and
embroideries
;
bonnets
and
gloves
;
for
*NL*
the
corbeille
had
been
of
rare
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
thing
to
go
was
a
tiny
bundle
of
letters
;
innocent
little
*NL*
scribblings
that
Desiree
had
sent
to
him
during
the
days
of
their
*NL*
espousal
.
There
was
the
remnant
of
one
back
in
the
drawer
from
which
he
*NL*
took
them
.
But
it
was
not
Desiree
's
;
it
was
part
of
an
old
letter
from
*NL*
his
mother
to
his
father
.
He
read
it
.
She
was
thanking
God
for
the
*NL*
blessing
of
her
husband
's
love
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
above
all
,
''
she
wrote
,
``
night
and
day
,
I
thank
the
good
God
for
*NL*
having
so
arranged
our
lives
that
our
dear
Armand
will
never
know
that
*NL*
his
mother
,
who
adores
him
,
belongs
to
the
race
that
is
cursed
with
the
*NL*
brand
of
slavery
.

*NL*
*NL*
A
RESPECTABLE
WOMAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Baroda
was
a
little
provoked
to
learn
that
her
husband
expected
his
*NL*
friend
,
Gouvernail
,
up
to
spend
a
week
or
two
on
the
plantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
entertained
a
good
deal
during
the
winter
;
much
of
the
time
had
*NL*
also
been
passed
in
New
Orleans
in
various
forms
of
mild
dissipation
.
*NL*
She
was
looking
forward
to
a
period
of
unbroken
rest
,
now
,
and
*NL*
undisturbed
tete-a-tete
with
her
husband
,
when
he
informed
her
that
*NL*
Gouvernail
was
coming
up
to
stay
a
week
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
man
she
had
heard
much
of
but
never
seen
.
He
had
been
her
*NL*
husband
's
college
friend
;
was
now
a
journalist
,
and
in
no
sense
a
*NL*
society
man
or
``
a
man
about
town
,
''
which
were
,
perhaps
,
some
of
the
*NL*
reasons
she
had
never
met
him
.
But
she
had
unconsciously
formed
an
*NL*
image
of
him
in
her
mind
.
She
pictured
him
tall
,
slim
,
cynical
;
with
*NL*
eye-glasses
,
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
;
and
she
did
not
like
him
.
*NL*
Gouvernail
was
slim
enough
,
but
he
was
n't
very
tall
nor
very
cynical
;
*NL*
neither
did
he
wear
eyeglasses
nor
carry
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
And
*NL*
she
rather
liked
him
when
he
first
presented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
why
she
liked
him
she
could
not
explain
satisfactorily
to
herself
*NL*
when
she
partly
attempted
to
do
so
.
She
could
discover
in
him
none
of
*NL*
those
brilliant
and
promising
traits
which
Gaston
,
her
husband
,
had
*NL*
often
assured
her
that
he
possessed
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
sat
rather
mute
*NL*
and
receptive
before
her
chatty
eagerness
to
make
him
feel
at
home
*NL*
and
in
face
of
Gaston
's
frank
and
wordy
hospitality
.
His
manner
was
as
*NL*
courteous
toward
her
as
the
most
exacting
woman
could
require
;
but
he
*NL*
made
no
direct
appeal
to
her
approval
or
even
esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
settled
at
the
plantation
he
seemed
to
like
to
sit
upon
the
wide
*NL*
portico
in
the
shade
of
one
of
the
big
Corinthian
pillars
,
smoking
his
*NL*
cigar
lazily
and
listening
attentively
to
Gaston
's
experience
as
a
sugar
*NL*
planter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
call
living
,
''
he
would
utter
with
deep
satisfaction
,
as
*NL*
the
air
that
swept
across
the
sugar
field
caressed
him
with
its
warm
and
*NL*
scented
velvety
touch
.
It
pleased
him
also
to
get
on
familiar
terms
with
*NL*
the
big
dogs
that
came
about
him
,
rubbing
themselves
sociably
against
*NL*
his
legs
.
He
did
not
care
to
fish
,
and
displayed
no
eagerness
to
go
out
*NL*
and
kill
grosbecs
when
Gaston
proposed
doing
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gouvernail
's
personality
puzzled
Mrs.
Baroda
,
but
she
liked
him
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
he
was
a
lovable
,
inoffensive
fellow
.
After
a
few
days
,
when
she
could
*NL*
understand
him
no
better
than
at
first
,
she
gave
over
being
puzzled
and
*NL*
remained
piqued
.
In
this
mood
she
left
her
husband
and
her
guest
,
for
*NL*
the
most
part
,
alone
together
.
Then
finding
that
Gouvernail
took
no
*NL*
manner
of
exception
to
her
action
,
she
imposed
her
society
upon
him
,
*NL*
accompanying
him
in
his
idle
strolls
to
the
mill
and
walks
along
the
*NL*
batture
.
She
persistently
sought
to
penetrate
the
reserve
in
which
he
*NL*
had
unconsciously
enveloped
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
he
going
--
your
friend
?
''
she
one
day
asked
her
husband
.
``
For
my
*NL*
part
,
he
tires
me
frightfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
week
yet
,
dear
.
I
ca
n't
understand
;
he
gives
you
no
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
should
like
him
better
if
he
did
;
if
he
were
more
like
others
,
*NL*
and
I
had
to
plan
somewhat
for
his
comfort
and
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gaston
took
his
wife
's
pretty
face
between
his
hands
and
looked
tenderly
*NL*
and
laughingly
into
her
troubled
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
making
a
bit
of
toilet
sociably
together
in
Mrs.
Baroda
's
*NL*
dressing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
full
of
surprises
,
ma
belle
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
Even
I
can
never
*NL*
count
upon
how
you
are
going
to
act
under
given
conditions
.
''
He
kissed
*NL*
her
and
turned
to
fasten
his
cravat
before
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
taking
poor
Gouvernail
seriously
and
making
*NL*
a
commotion
over
him
,
the
last
thing
he
would
desire
or
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Commotion
!
''
she
hotly
resented
.
``
Nonsense
!
How
can
you
say
such
a
*NL*
thing
?
Commotion
,
indeed
!
But
,
you
know
,
you
said
he
was
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
is
.
But
the
poor
fellow
is
run
down
by
overwork
now
.
That
's
why
I
*NL*
asked
him
here
to
take
a
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
say
he
was
a
man
of
ideas
,
''
she
retorted
,
unconciliated
.
``
I
*NL*
expected
him
to
be
interesting
,
at
least
.
I
'm
going
to
the
city
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
have
my
spring
gowns
fitted
.
Let
me
know
when
Mr.
Gouvernail
*NL*
is
gone
;
I
shall
be
at
my
Aunt
Octavie
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
she
went
and
sat
alone
upon
a
bench
that
stood
beneath
a
live
*NL*
oak
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
gravel
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
known
her
thoughts
or
her
intentions
to
be
so
confused
.
*NL*
She
could
gather
nothing
from
them
but
the
feeling
of
a
distinct
*NL*
necessity
to
quit
her
home
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Baroda
heard
footsteps
crunching
the
gravel
;
but
could
discern
in
*NL*
the
darkness
only
the
approaching
red
point
of
a
lighted
cigar
.
She
knew
*NL*
it
was
Gouvernail
,
for
her
husband
did
not
smoke
.
She
hoped
to
remain
*NL*
unnoticed
,
but
her
white
gown
revealed
her
to
him
.
He
threw
away
his
*NL*
cigar
and
seated
himself
upon
the
bench
beside
her
;
without
a
suspicion
*NL*
that
she
might
object
to
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
told
me
to
bring
this
to
you
,
Mrs.
Baroda
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
handing
her
a
filmy
,
white
scarf
with
which
she
sometimes
enveloped
her
*NL*
head
and
shoulders
.
She
accepted
the
scarf
from
him
with
a
murmur
of
*NL*
thanks
,
and
let
it
lie
in
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
some
commonplace
observation
upon
the
baneful
effect
of
the
*NL*
night
air
at
the
season
.
Then
as
his
gaze
reached
out
into
the
darkness
,
*NL*
he
murmured
,
half
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Night
of
south
winds
--
night
of
the
large
few
stars
!
Still
nodding
*NL*
night
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
reply
to
this
apostrophe
to
the
night
,
which
,
indeed
,
was
*NL*
not
addressed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gouvernail
was
in
no
sense
a
diffident
man
,
for
he
was
not
a
*NL*
self-conscious
one
.
His
periods
of
reserve
were
not
constitutional
,
*NL*
but
the
result
of
moods
.
Sitting
there
beside
Mrs.
Baroda
,
his
silence
*NL*
melted
for
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
talked
freely
and
intimately
in
a
low
,
hesitating
drawl
that
was
not
*NL*
unpleasant
to
hear
.
He
talked
of
the
old
college
days
when
he
and
*NL*
Gaston
had
been
a
good
deal
to
each
other
;
of
the
days
of
keen
and
blind
*NL*
ambitions
and
large
intentions
.
Now
there
was
left
with
him
,
at
least
,
*NL*
a
philosophic
acquiescence
to
the
existing
order
--
only
a
desire
to
be
*NL*
permitted
to
exist
,
with
now
and
then
a
little
whiff
of
genuine
life
,
*NL*
such
as
he
was
breathing
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
only
vaguely
grasped
what
he
was
saying
.
Her
physical
being
*NL*
was
for
the
moment
predominant
.
She
was
not
thinking
of
his
words
,
only
*NL*
drinking
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
.
She
wanted
to
reach
out
her
hand
in
*NL*
the
darkness
and
touch
him
with
the
sensitive
tips
of
her
fingers
*NL*
upon
the
face
or
the
lips
.
She
wanted
to
draw
close
to
him
and
whisper
*NL*
against
his
cheek
--
she
did
not
care
what
--
as
she
might
have
done
if
she
*NL*
had
not
been
a
respectable
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stronger
the
impulse
grew
to
bring
herself
near
him
,
the
further
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
did
she
draw
away
from
him
.
As
soon
as
she
could
do
so
without
an
*NL*
appearance
of
too
great
rudeness
,
she
rose
and
left
him
there
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
reached
the
house
,
Gouvernail
had
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
*NL*
ended
his
apostrophe
to
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Baroda
was
greatly
tempted
that
night
to
tell
her
husband
--
who
*NL*
was
also
her
friend
--
of
this
folly
that
had
seized
her
.
But
she
did
not
*NL*
yield
to
the
temptation
.
Beside
being
a
respectable
woman
she
was
a
very
*NL*
sensible
one
;
and
she
knew
there
are
some
battles
in
life
which
a
human
*NL*
being
must
fight
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gaston
arose
in
the
morning
,
his
wife
had
already
departed
.
She
*NL*
had
taken
an
early
morning
train
to
the
city
.
She
did
not
return
till
*NL*
Gouvernail
was
gone
from
under
her
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
talk
of
having
him
back
during
the
summer
that
followed
.
*NL*
That
is
,
Gaston
greatly
desired
it
;
but
this
desire
yielded
to
his
*NL*
wife
's
strenuous
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
before
the
year
ended
,
she
proposed
,
wholly
from
herself
,
*NL*
to
have
Gouvernail
visit
them
again
.
Her
husband
was
surprised
and
*NL*
delighted
with
the
suggestion
coming
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
chere
amie
,
to
know
that
you
have
finally
overcome
your
*NL*
dislike
for
him
;
truly
he
did
not
deserve
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
told
him
,
laughingly
,
after
pressing
a
long
,
tender
kiss
upon
*NL*
his
lips
,
``
I
have
overcome
everything
!
you
will
see
.
This
time
I
shall
*NL*
be
very
nice
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
KISS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
quite
light
out
of
doors
,
but
inside
with
the
curtains
*NL*
drawn
and
the
smouldering
fire
sending
out
a
dim
,
uncertain
glow
,
the
*NL*
room
was
full
of
deep
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brantain
sat
in
one
of
these
shadows
;
it
had
overtaken
him
and
he
did
*NL*
not
mind
.
The
obscurity
lent
him
courage
to
keep
his
eyes
fastened
as
*NL*
ardently
as
he
liked
upon
the
girl
who
sat
in
the
firelight
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
handsome
,
with
a
certain
fine
,
rich
coloring
that
belongs
*NL*
to
the
healthy
brune
type
.
She
was
quite
composed
,
as
she
idly
*NL*
stroked
the
satiny
coat
of
the
cat
that
lay
curled
in
her
lap
,
and
she
*NL*
occasionally
sent
a
slow
glance
into
the
shadow
where
her
companion
sat
.
*NL*
They
were
talking
low
,
of
indifferent
things
which
plainly
were
not
*NL*
the
things
that
occupied
their
thoughts
.
She
knew
that
he
loved
her
--
a
*NL*
frank
,
blustering
fellow
without
guile
enough
to
conceal
his
feelings
,
*NL*
and
no
desire
to
do
so
.
For
two
weeks
past
he
had
sought
her
society
*NL*
eagerly
and
persistently
.
She
was
confidently
waiting
for
him
to
declare
*NL*
himself
and
she
meant
to
accept
him
.
The
rather
insignificant
and
*NL*
unattractive
Brantain
was
enormously
rich
;
and
she
liked
and
required
*NL*
the
entourage
which
wealth
could
give
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
one
of
the
pauses
between
their
talk
of
the
last
tea
and
the
next
*NL*
reception
the
door
opened
and
a
young
man
entered
whom
Brantain
knew
*NL*
quite
well
.
The
girl
turned
her
face
toward
him
.
A
stride
or
two
brought
*NL*
him
to
her
side
,
and
bending
over
her
chair
--
before
she
could
suspect
*NL*
his
intention
,
for
she
did
not
realize
that
he
had
not
seen
her
*NL*
visitor
--
he
pressed
an
ardent
,
lingering
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brantain
slowly
arose
;
so
did
the
girl
arise
,
but
quickly
,
and
the
*NL*
newcomer
stood
between
them
,
a
little
amusement
and
some
defiance
*NL*
struggling
with
the
confusion
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
''
stammered
Brantain
,
``
I
see
that
I
have
stayed
too
long
.
*NL*
I
--
I
had
no
idea
--
that
is
,
I
must
wish
you
good-by
.
''
He
was
clutching
*NL*
his
hat
with
both
hands
,
and
probably
did
not
perceive
that
she
was
*NL*
extending
her
hand
to
him
,
her
presence
of
mind
had
not
completely
*NL*
deserted
her
;
but
she
could
not
have
trusted
herself
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
me
if
I
saw
him
sitting
there
,
Nattie
!
I
know
it
's
deuced
awkward
*NL*
for
you
.
But
I
hope
you
'll
forgive
me
this
once
--
this
very
first
break
.
*NL*
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
touch
me
;
do
n't
come
near
me
,
''
she
returned
angrily
.
``
What
do
you
*NL*
mean
by
entering
the
house
without
ringing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
in
with
your
brother
,
as
I
often
do
,
''
he
answered
coldly
,
in
*NL*
self-justification
.
``
We
came
in
the
side
way
.
He
went
upstairs
and
I
*NL*
came
in
here
hoping
to
find
you
.
The
explanation
is
simple
enough
and
*NL*
ought
to
satisfy
you
that
the
misadventure
was
unavoidable
.
But
do
say
*NL*
that
you
forgive
me
,
Nathalie
,
''
he
entreated
,
softening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
you
!
You
do
n't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
.
Let
me
pass
.
It
*NL*
depends
upon
--
a
good
deal
whether
I
ever
forgive
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
next
reception
which
she
and
Brantain
had
been
talking
about
she
*NL*
approached
the
young
man
with
a
delicious
frankness
of
manner
when
she
*NL*
saw
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
speak
to
you
a
moment
or
two
,
Mr.
Brantain
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
with
an
engaging
but
perturbed
smile
.
He
seemed
extremely
unhappy
;
*NL*
but
when
she
took
his
arm
and
walked
away
with
him
,
seeking
a
retired
*NL*
corner
,
a
ray
of
hope
mingled
with
the
almost
comical
misery
of
his
*NL*
expression
.
She
was
apparently
very
outspoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
should
not
have
sought
this
interview
,
Mr.
Brantain
;
*NL*
but
--
but
,
oh
,
I
have
been
very
uncomfortable
,
almost
miserable
since
*NL*
that
little
encounter
the
other
afternoon
.
When
I
thought
how
you
might
*NL*
have
misinterpreted
it
,
and
believed
things
''
--
hope
was
plainly
gaining
*NL*
the
ascendancy
over
misery
in
Brantain
's
round
,
guileless
face
--
``
Of
*NL*
course
,
I
know
it
is
nothing
to
you
,
but
for
my
own
sake
I
do
want
you
*NL*
to
understand
that
Mr.
Harvy
is
an
intimate
friend
of
long
standing
.
*NL*
Why
,
we
have
always
been
like
cousins
--
like
brother
and
sister
,
I
may
*NL*
say
.
He
is
my
brother
's
most
intimate
associate
and
often
fancies
that
*NL*
he
is
entitled
to
the
same
privileges
as
the
family
.
Oh
,
I
know
it
*NL*
is
absurd
,
uncalled
for
,
to
tell
you
this
;
undignified
even
,
''
she
was
*NL*
almost
weeping
,
``
but
it
makes
so
much
difference
to
me
what
you
think
*NL*
of
--
of
me
.
''
Her
voice
had
grown
very
low
and
agitated
.
The
misery
had
*NL*
all
disappeared
from
Brantain
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
really
care
what
I
think
,
Miss
Nathalie
?
May
I
call
you
*NL*
Miss
Nathalie
?
''
They
turned
into
a
long
,
dim
corridor
that
was
lined
on
*NL*
either
side
with
tall
,
graceful
plants
.
They
walked
slowly
to
the
very
*NL*
end
of
it
.
When
they
turned
to
retrace
their
steps
Brantain
's
face
was
*NL*
radiant
and
hers
was
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Harvy
was
among
the
guests
at
the
wedding
;
and
he
sought
her
out
in
a
*NL*
rare
moment
when
she
stood
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
husband
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
``
has
sent
me
over
to
kiss
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
blush
suffused
her
face
and
round
polished
throat
.
``
I
suppose
*NL*
it
's
natural
for
a
man
to
feel
and
act
generously
on
an
occasion
of
this
*NL*
kind
.
He
tells
me
he
does
n't
want
his
marriage
to
interrupt
wholly
that
*NL*
pleasant
intimacy
which
has
existed
between
you
and
me
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
you
've
been
telling
him
,
''
with
an
insolent
smile
,
``
but
he
has
sent
*NL*
me
here
to
kiss
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
like
a
chess
player
who
,
by
the
clever
handling
of
his
pieces
,
*NL*
sees
the
game
taking
the
course
intended
.
Her
eyes
were
bright
and
*NL*
tender
with
a
smile
as
they
glanced
up
into
his
;
and
her
lips
looked
*NL*
hungry
for
the
kiss
which
they
invited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
you
know
,
''
he
went
on
quietly
,
``
I
did
n't
tell
him
so
,
it
would
*NL*
have
seemed
ungrateful
,
but
I
can
tell
you
.
I
've
stopped
kissing
women
;
*NL*
it
's
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
she
had
Brantain
and
his
million
left
.
A
person
ca
n't
have
*NL*
everything
in
this
world
;
and
it
was
a
little
unreasonable
of
her
to
*NL*
expect
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
PAIR
OF
SILK
STOCKINGS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Mrs.
Sommers
one
day
found
herself
the
unexpected
possessor
of
*NL*
fifteen
dollars
.
It
seemed
to
her
a
very
large
amount
of
money
,
and
the
*NL*
way
in
which
it
stuffed
and
bulged
her
worn
old
porte-monnaie
gave
her
a
*NL*
feeling
of
importance
such
as
she
had
not
enjoyed
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
of
investment
was
one
that
occupied
her
greatly
.
For
a
*NL*
day
or
two
she
walked
about
apparently
in
a
dreamy
state
,
but
really
*NL*
absorbed
in
speculation
and
calculation
.
She
did
not
wish
to
act
*NL*
hastily
,
to
do
anything
she
might
afterward
regret
.
But
it
was
during
*NL*
the
still
hours
of
the
night
when
she
lay
awake
revolving
plans
in
*NL*
her
mind
that
she
seemed
to
see
her
way
clearly
toward
a
proper
and
*NL*
judicious
use
of
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dollar
or
two
should
be
added
to
the
price
usually
paid
for
Janie
's
*NL*
shoes
,
which
would
insure
their
lasting
an
appreciable
time
longer
than
*NL*
they
usually
did
.
She
would
buy
so
and
so
many
yards
of
percale
for
new
*NL*
shirt
waists
for
the
boys
and
Janie
and
Mag
.
She
had
intended
to
make
*NL*
the
old
ones
do
by
skilful
patching
.
Mag
should
have
another
gown
.
*NL*
She
had
seen
some
beautiful
patterns
,
veritable
bargains
in
the
shop
*NL*
windows
.
And
still
there
would
be
left
enough
for
new
stockings
--
two
*NL*
pairs
apiece
--
and
what
darning
that
would
save
for
a
while
!
She
would
*NL*
get
caps
for
the
boys
and
sailor-hats
for
the
girls
.
The
vision
of
her
*NL*
little
brood
looking
fresh
and
dainty
and
new
for
once
in
their
lives
*NL*
excited
her
and
made
her
restless
and
wakeful
with
anticipation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbors
sometimes
talked
of
certain
``
better
days
''
that
little
Mrs.
*NL*
Sommers
had
known
before
she
had
ever
thought
of
being
Mrs.
Sommers
.
She
*NL*
herself
indulged
in
no
such
morbid
retrospection
.
She
had
no
time
--
no
*NL*
second
of
time
to
devote
to
the
past
.
The
needs
of
the
present
absorbed
*NL*
her
every
faculty
.
A
vision
of
the
future
like
some
dim
,
gaunt
monster
*NL*
sometimes
appalled
her
,
but
luckily
to-morrow
never
comes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sommers
was
one
who
knew
the
value
of
bargains
;
who
could
stand
*NL*
for
hours
making
her
way
inch
by
inch
toward
the
desired
object
that
was
*NL*
selling
below
cost
.
She
could
elbow
her
way
if
need
be
;
she
had
learned
*NL*
to
clutch
a
piece
of
goods
and
hold
it
and
stick
to
it
with
persistence
*NL*
and
determination
till
her
turn
came
to
be
served
,
no
matter
when
it
*NL*
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
day
she
was
a
little
faint
and
tired
.
She
had
swallowed
a
light
*NL*
luncheon
--
no
!
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
,
between
getting
the
children
*NL*
fed
and
the
place
righted
,
and
preparing
herself
for
the
shopping
bout
,
*NL*
she
had
actually
forgotten
to
eat
any
luncheon
at
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
herself
upon
a
revolving
stool
before
a
counter
that
was
*NL*
comparatively
deserted
,
trying
to
gather
strength
and
courage
to
charge
*NL*
through
an
eager
multitude
that
was
besieging
breastworks
of
shirting
*NL*
and
figured
lawn
.
An
all-gone
limp
feeling
had
come
over
her
and
she
*NL*
rested
her
hand
aimlessly
upon
the
counter
.
She
wore
no
gloves
.
By
*NL*
degrees
she
grew
aware
that
her
hand
had
encountered
something
very
*NL*
soothing
,
very
pleasant
to
touch
.
She
looked
down
to
see
that
her
hand
*NL*
lay
upon
a
pile
of
silk
stockings
.
A
placard
near
by
announced
that
they
*NL*
had
been
reduced
in
price
from
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
to
one
dollar
*NL*
and
ninety-eight
cents
;
and
a
young
girl
who
stood
behind
the
counter
*NL*
asked
her
if
she
wished
to
examine
their
line
of
silk
hosiery
.
She
*NL*
smiled
,
just
as
if
she
had
been
asked
to
inspect
a
tiara
of
diamonds
*NL*
with
the
ultimate
view
of
purchasing
it
.
But
she
went
on
feeling
the
*NL*
soft
,
sheeny
luxurious
things
--
with
both
hands
now
,
holding
them
up
*NL*
to
see
them
glisten
,
and
to
feel
them
glide
serpent-like
through
her
*NL*
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hectic
blotches
came
suddenly
into
her
pale
cheeks
.
She
looked
up
at
*NL*
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
there
are
any
eights-and-a-half
among
these
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
any
number
of
eights-and-a-half
.
In
fact
,
there
were
more
of
*NL*
that
size
than
any
other
.
Here
was
a
light-blue
pair
;
there
were
some
*NL*
lavender
,
some
all
black
and
various
shades
of
tan
and
gray
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Sommers
selected
a
black
pair
and
looked
at
them
very
long
and
closely
.
*NL*
She
pretended
to
be
examining
their
texture
,
which
the
clerk
assured
her
*NL*
was
excellent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dollar
and
ninety-eight
cents
,
''
she
mused
aloud
.
``
Well
,
I
'll
take
*NL*
this
pair
.
''
She
handed
the
girl
a
five-dollar
bill
and
waited
for
her
*NL*
change
and
for
her
parcel
.
What
a
very
small
parcel
it
was
!
It
seemed
*NL*
lost
in
the
depths
of
her
shabby
old
shopping-bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Sommers
after
that
did
not
move
in
the
direction
of
the
bargain
*NL*
counter
.
She
took
the
elevator
,
which
carried
her
to
an
upper
floor
into
*NL*
the
region
of
the
ladies
'
waiting-rooms
.
Here
,
in
a
retired
corner
,
she
*NL*
exchanged
her
cotton
stockings
for
the
new
silk
ones
which
she
had
just
*NL*
bought
.
She
was
not
going
through
any
acute
mental
process
or
reasoning
*NL*
with
herself
,
nor
was
she
striving
to
explain
to
her
satisfaction
the
*NL*
motive
of
her
action
.
She
was
not
thinking
at
all
.
She
seemed
for
the
*NL*
time
to
be
taking
a
rest
from
that
laborious
and
fatiguing
function
and
*NL*
to
have
abandoned
herself
to
some
mechanical
impulse
that
directed
her
*NL*
actions
and
freed
her
of
responsibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
good
was
the
touch
of
the
raw
silk
to
her
flesh
!
She
felt
like
lying
*NL*
back
in
the
cushioned
chair
and
reveling
for
a
while
in
the
luxury
of
*NL*
it
.
She
did
for
a
little
while
.
Then
she
replaced
her
shoes
,
rolled
the
*NL*
cotton
stockings
together
and
thrust
them
into
her
bag
.
After
doing
this
*NL*
she
crossed
straight
over
to
the
shoe
department
and
took
her
seat
to
be
*NL*
fitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fastidious
.
The
clerk
could
not
make
her
out
;
he
could
not
*NL*
reconcile
her
shoes
with
her
stockings
,
and
she
was
not
too
easily
*NL*
pleased
.
She
held
back
her
skirts
and
turned
her
feet
one
way
and
her
*NL*
head
another
way
as
she
glanced
down
at
the
polished
,
pointed-tipped
*NL*
boots
.
Her
foot
and
ankle
looked
very
pretty
.
She
could
not
realize
that
*NL*
they
belonged
to
her
and
were
a
part
of
herself
.
She
wanted
an
excellent
*NL*
and
stylish
fit
,
she
told
the
young
fellow
who
served
her
,
and
she
did
*NL*
not
mind
the
difference
of
a
dollar
or
two
more
in
the
price
so
long
as
*NL*
she
got
what
she
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
time
since
Mrs.
Sommers
had
been
fitted
with
gloves
.
On
*NL*
rare
occasions
when
she
had
bought
a
pair
they
were
always
``
bargains
,
''
*NL*
so
cheap
that
it
would
have
been
preposterous
and
unreasonable
to
have
*NL*
expected
them
to
be
fitted
to
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
rested
her
elbow
on
the
cushion
of
the
glove
counter
,
and
a
*NL*
pretty
,
pleasant
young
creature
,
delicate
and
deft
of
touch
,
drew
a
*NL*
long-wristed
``
kid
''
over
Mrs.
Sommers
's
hand
.
She
smoothed
it
down
over
*NL*
the
wrist
and
buttoned
it
neatly
,
and
both
lost
themselves
for
a
second
*NL*
or
two
in
admiring
contemplation
of
the
little
symmetrical
gloved
hand
.
*NL*
But
there
were
other
places
where
money
might
be
spent
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
books
and
magazines
piled
up
in
the
window
of
a
stall
a
few
*NL*
paces
down
the
street
.
Mrs.
Sommers
bought
two
high-priced
magazines
*NL*
such
as
she
had
been
accustomed
to
read
in
the
days
when
she
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
other
pleasant
things
.
She
carried
them
without
wrapping
.
*NL*
As
well
as
she
could
she
lifted
her
skirts
at
the
crossings
.
Her
*NL*
stockings
and
boots
and
well
fitting
gloves
had
worked
marvels
in
her
*NL*
bearing
--
had
given
her
a
feeling
of
assurance
,
a
sense
of
belonging
to
*NL*
the
well-dressed
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
hungry
.
Another
time
she
would
have
stilled
the
cravings
*NL*
for
food
until
reaching
her
own
home
,
where
she
would
have
brewed
*NL*
herself
a
cup
of
tea
and
taken
a
snack
of
anything
that
was
available
.
*NL*
But
the
impulse
that
was
guiding
her
would
not
suffer
her
to
entertain
*NL*
any
such
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
restaurant
at
the
corner
.
She
had
never
entered
its
doors
;
*NL*
from
the
outside
she
had
sometimes
caught
glimpses
of
spotless
damask
*NL*
and
shining
crystal
,
and
soft-stepping
waiters
serving
people
of
*NL*
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
entered
her
appearance
created
no
surprise
,
no
consternation
,
*NL*
as
she
had
half
feared
it
might
.
She
seated
herself
at
a
small
table
*NL*
alone
,
and
an
attentive
waiter
at
once
approached
to
take
her
order
.
She
*NL*
did
not
want
a
profusion
;
she
craved
a
nice
and
tasty
bite
--
a
half
*NL*
dozen
blue-points
,
a
plump
chop
with
cress
,
a
something
sweet
--
a
*NL*
creme-frappee
,
for
instance
;
a
glass
of
Rhine
wine
,
and
after
all
a
*NL*
small
cup
of
black
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
waiting
to
be
served
she
removed
her
gloves
very
leisurely
and
*NL*
laid
them
beside
her
.
Then
she
picked
up
a
magazine
and
glanced
through
*NL*
it
,
cutting
the
pages
with
a
blunt
edge
of
her
knife
.
It
was
all
very
*NL*
agreeable
.
The
damask
was
even
more
spotless
than
it
had
seemed
through
*NL*
the
window
,
and
the
crystal
more
sparkling
.
There
were
quiet
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
,
who
did
not
notice
her
,
lunching
at
the
small
tables
like
*NL*
her
own
.
A
soft
,
pleasing
strain
of
music
could
be
heard
,
and
a
gentle
*NL*
breeze
,
was
blowing
through
the
window
.
She
tasted
a
bite
,
and
she
read
*NL*
a
word
or
two
,
and
she
sipped
the
amber
wine
and
wiggled
her
toes
in
*NL*
the
silk
stockings
.
The
price
of
it
made
no
difference
.
She
counted
the
*NL*
money
out
to
the
waiter
and
left
an
extra
coin
on
his
tray
,
whereupon
he
*NL*
bowed
before
her
as
before
a
princess
of
royal
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
money
in
her
purse
,
and
her
next
temptation
presented
*NL*
itself
in
the
shape
of
a
matinee
poster
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
later
when
she
entered
the
theatre
,
the
play
had
begun
*NL*
and
the
house
seemed
to
her
to
be
packed
.
But
there
were
vacant
*NL*
seats
here
and
there
,
and
into
one
of
them
she
was
ushered
,
between
*NL*
brilliantly
dressed
women
who
had
gone
there
to
kill
time
and
eat
candy
*NL*
and
display
their
gaudy
attire
.
There
were
many
others
who
were
there
*NL*
solely
for
the
play
and
acting
.
It
is
safe
to
say
there
was
no
one
*NL*
present
who
bore
quite
the
attitude
which
Mrs.
Sommers
did
to
her
*NL*
surroundings
.
She
gathered
in
the
whole
--
stage
and
players
and
people
in
*NL*
one
wide
impression
,
and
absorbed
it
and
enjoyed
it
.
She
laughed
at
*NL*
the
comedy
and
wept
--
she
and
the
gaudy
woman
next
to
her
wept
over
the
*NL*
tragedy
.
And
they
talked
a
little
together
over
it
.
And
the
gaudy
woman
*NL*
wiped
her
eyes
and
sniffled
on
a
tiny
square
of
filmy
,
perfumed
lace
and
*NL*
passed
little
Mrs.
Sommers
her
box
of
candy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
was
over
,
the
music
ceased
,
the
crowd
filed
out
.
It
was
like
*NL*
a
dream
ended
.
People
scattered
in
all
directions
.
Mrs.
Sommers
went
to
*NL*
the
corner
and
waited
for
the
cable
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
with
keen
eyes
,
who
sat
opposite
to
her
,
seemed
to
like
the
study
*NL*
of
her
small
,
pale
face
.
It
puzzled
him
to
decipher
what
he
saw
there
.
*NL*
In
truth
,
he
saw
nothing-unless
he
were
wizard
enough
to
detect
a
*NL*
poignant
wish
,
a
powerful
longing
that
the
cable
car
would
never
stop
*NL*
anywhere
,
but
go
on
and
on
with
her
forever
.

THE
LOCKET
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
in
autumn
a
few
men
were
gathered
about
a
fire
on
the
slope
*NL*
of
a
hill
.
They
belonged
to
a
small
detachment
of
Confederate
forces
and
*NL*
were
awaiting
orders
to
march
.
Their
gray
uniforms
were
worn
beyond
the
*NL*
point
of
shabbiness
.
One
of
the
men
was
heating
something
in
a
tin
cup
*NL*
over
the
embers
.
Two
were
lying
at
full
length
a
little
distance
away
,
*NL*
while
a
fourth
was
trying
to
decipher
a
letter
and
had
drawn
close
to
*NL*
the
light
.
He
had
unfastened
his
collar
and
a
good
bit
of
his
flannel
*NL*
shirt
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
got
around
your
neck
,
Ned
?
''
asked
one
of
the
men
lying
*NL*
in
the
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
--
or
Edmond
--
mechanically
fastened
another
button
of
his
shirt
and
*NL*
did
not
reply
.
He
went
on
reading
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
your
sweet
heart
's
picture
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Taint
no
gal
's
picture
,
''
offered
the
man
at
the
fire
.
He
had
removed
*NL*
his
tin
cup
and
was
engaged
in
stirring
its
grimy
contents
with
a
small
*NL*
stick
.
``
That
's
a
charm
;
some
kind
of
hoodoo
business
that
one
o
'
them
*NL*
priests
gave
him
to
keep
him
out
o
'
trouble
.
I
know
them
Cath
`
lics
.
*NL*
That
's
how
come
Frenchy
got
permoted
an
never
got
a
scratch
sence
he
's
*NL*
been
in
the
ranks
.
Hey
,
French
!
aint
I
right
?
''
Edmond
looked
up
absently
*NL*
from
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aint
that
a
charm
you
got
round
your
neck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
,
Nick
,
''
returned
Edmond
with
a
smile
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
I
*NL*
could
have
gone
through
this
year
and
a
half
without
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
had
made
Edmond
heart
sick
and
home
sick
.
He
stretched
*NL*
himself
on
his
back
and
looked
straight
up
at
the
blinking
stars
.
But
he
*NL*
was
not
thinking
of
them
nor
of
anything
but
a
certain
spring
day
when
*NL*
the
bees
were
humming
in
the
clematis
;
when
a
girl
was
saying
good
bye
*NL*
to
him
.
He
could
see
her
as
she
unclasped
from
her
neck
the
locket
*NL*
which
she
fastened
about
his
own
.
It
was
an
old
fashioned
golden
locket
*NL*
bearing
miniatures
of
her
father
and
mother
with
their
names
and
the
*NL*
date
of
their
marriage
.
It
was
her
most
precious
earthly
possession
.
*NL*
Edmond
could
feel
again
the
folds
of
the
girl
's
soft
white
gown
,
and
see
*NL*
the
droop
of
the
angel-sleeves
as
she
circled
her
fair
arms
about
his
*NL*
neck
.
Her
sweet
face
,
appealing
,
pathetic
,
tormented
by
the
pain
of
*NL*
parting
,
appeared
before
him
as
vividly
as
life
.
He
turned
over
,
burying
*NL*
his
face
in
his
arm
and
there
he
lay
,
still
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
profound
and
treacherous
night
with
its
silence
and
semblance
of
*NL*
peace
settled
upon
the
camp
.
He
dreamed
that
the
fair
Octavie
*NL*
brought
him
a
letter
.
He
had
no
chair
to
offer
her
and
was
pained
and
*NL*
embarrassed
at
the
condition
of
his
garments
.
He
was
ashamed
of
the
poor
*NL*
food
which
comprised
the
dinner
at
which
he
begged
her
to
join
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dreamt
of
a
serpent
coiling
around
his
throat
,
and
when
he
strove
to
*NL*
grasp
it
the
slimy
thing
glided
away
from
his
clutch
.
Then
his
dream
was
*NL*
clamor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Git
your
duds
!
you
!
Frenchy
!
''
Nick
was
bellowing
in
his
face
.
There
*NL*
was
what
appeared
to
be
a
scramble
and
a
rush
rather
than
any
regulated
*NL*
movement
.
The
hill
side
was
alive
with
clatter
and
motion
;
with
sudden
*NL*
up-springing
lights
among
the
pines
.
In
the
east
the
dawn
was
unfolding
*NL*
out
of
the
darkness
.
Its
glimmer
was
yet
dim
in
the
plain
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
all
about
?
''
wondered
a
big
black
bird
perched
in
the
top
of
*NL*
the
tallest
tree
.
He
was
an
old
solitary
and
a
wise
one
,
yet
he
was
*NL*
not
wise
enough
to
guess
what
it
was
all
about
.
So
all
day
long
he
kept
*NL*
blinking
and
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
reached
far
out
over
the
plain
and
across
the
hills
and
awoke
*NL*
the
little
babes
that
were
sleeping
in
their
cradles
.
The
smoke
curled
*NL*
up
toward
the
sun
and
shadowed
the
plain
so
that
the
stupid
birds
*NL*
thought
it
was
going
to
rain
;
but
the
wise
one
knew
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
children
playing
a
game
,
''
thought
he
.
``
I
shall
know
more
about
*NL*
it
if
I
watch
long
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
approach
of
night
they
had
all
vanished
away
with
their
din
and
*NL*
smoke
.
Then
the
old
bird
plumed
his
feathers
.
At
last
he
had
understood
!
*NL*
With
a
flap
of
his
great
,
black
wings
he
shot
downward
,
circling
toward
*NL*
the
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
was
picking
his
way
across
the
plain
.
He
was
dressed
in
the
*NL*
garb
of
a
clergyman
.
His
mission
was
to
administer
the
consolations
of
*NL*
religion
to
any
of
the
prostrate
figures
in
whom
there
might
yet
linger
*NL*
a
spark
of
life
.
A
negro
accompanied
him
,
bearing
a
bucket
of
water
and
*NL*
a
flask
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
wounded
here
;
they
had
been
borne
away
.
But
the
retreat
*NL*
had
been
hurried
and
the
vultures
and
the
good
Samaritans
would
have
to
*NL*
look
to
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
soldier
--
a
mere
boy
--
lying
with
his
face
to
the
sky
.
His
*NL*
hands
were
clutching
the
sward
on
either
side
and
his
finger
nails
*NL*
were
stuffed
with
earth
and
bits
of
grass
that
he
had
gathered
in
his
*NL*
despairing
grasp
upon
life
.
His
musket
was
gone
;
he
was
hatless
and
his
*NL*
face
and
clothing
were
begrimed
.
Around
his
neck
hung
a
gold
chain
and
*NL*
locket
.
The
priest
,
bending
over
him
,
unclasped
the
chain
and
removed
*NL*
it
from
the
dead
soldier
's
neck
.
He
had
grown
used
to
the
terrors
of
*NL*
war
and
could
face
them
unflinchingly
;
but
its
pathos
,
someway
,
always
*NL*
brought
the
tears
to
his
old
,
dim
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
angelus
was
ringing
half
a
mile
away
.
The
priest
and
the
negro
knelt
*NL*
and
murmured
together
the
evening
benediction
and
a
prayer
for
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
peace
and
beauty
of
a
spring
day
had
descended
upon
the
earth
like
*NL*
a
benediction
.
Along
the
leafy
road
which
skirted
a
narrow
,
tortuous
*NL*
stream
in
central
Louisiana
,
rumbled
an
old
fashioned
cabriolet
,
much
*NL*
the
worse
for
hard
and
rough
usage
over
country
roads
and
lanes
.
*NL*
The
fat
,
black
horses
went
in
a
slow
,
measured
trot
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
constant
urging
on
the
part
of
the
fat
,
black
coachman
.
Within
the
*NL*
vehicle
were
seated
the
fair
Octavie
and
her
old
friend
and
neighbor
,
*NL*
Judge
Pillier
,
who
had
come
to
take
her
for
a
morning
drive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Octavie
wore
a
plain
black
dress
,
severe
in
its
simplicity
.
A
narrow
*NL*
belt
held
it
at
the
waist
and
the
sleeves
were
gathered
into
close
*NL*
fitting
wristbands
.
She
had
discarded
her
hoopskirt
and
appeared
not
*NL*
unlike
a
nun
.
Beneath
the
folds
of
her
bodice
nestled
the
old
locket
.
*NL*
She
never
displayed
it
now
.
It
had
returned
to
her
sanctified
in
her
*NL*
eyes
;
made
precious
as
material
things
sometimes
are
by
being
forever
*NL*
identified
with
a
significant
moment
of
one
's
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hundred
times
she
had
read
over
the
letter
with
which
the
locket
had
*NL*
come
back
to
her
.
No
later
than
that
morning
she
had
again
pored
over
*NL*
it
.
As
she
sat
beside
the
window
,
smoothing
the
letter
out
upon
her
*NL*
knee
,
heavy
and
spiced
odors
stole
in
to
her
with
the
songs
of
birds
and
*NL*
the
humming
of
insects
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
young
and
the
world
was
so
beautiful
that
there
came
over
her
*NL*
a
sense
of
unreality
as
she
read
again
and
again
the
priest
's
letter
.
He
*NL*
told
of
that
autumn
day
drawing
to
its
close
,
with
the
gold
and
the
red
*NL*
fading
out
of
the
west
,
and
the
night
gathering
its
shadows
to
cover
the
*NL*
faces
of
the
dead
.
Oh
!
She
could
not
believe
that
one
of
those
dead
*NL*
was
her
own
!
with
visage
uplifted
to
the
gray
sky
in
an
agony
of
*NL*
supplication
.
A
spasm
of
resistance
and
rebellion
seized
and
swept
over
*NL*
her
.
Why
was
the
spring
here
with
its
flowers
and
its
seductive
breath
*NL*
if
he
was
dead
!
Why
was
she
here
!
What
further
had
she
to
do
with
life
*NL*
and
the
living
!
*NL*
*NL*
Octavie
had
experienced
many
such
moments
of
despair
,
but
a
blessed
*NL*
resignation
had
never
failed
to
follow
,
and
it
fell
then
upon
her
like
a
*NL*
mantle
and
enveloped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
grow
old
and
quiet
and
sad
like
poor
Aunt
Tavie
,
''
she
murmured
*NL*
to
herself
as
she
folded
the
letter
and
replaced
it
in
the
secretary
.
*NL*
Already
she
gave
herself
a
little
demure
air
like
her
Aunt
Tavie
.
She
*NL*
walked
with
a
slow
glide
in
unconscious
imitation
of
Mademoiselle
Tavie
*NL*
whom
some
youthful
affliction
had
robbed
of
earthly
compensation
while
*NL*
leaving
her
in
possession
of
youth
's
illusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
sat
in
the
old
cabriolet
beside
the
father
of
her
dead
lover
,
*NL*
again
there
came
to
Octavie
the
terrible
sense
of
loss
which
had
*NL*
assailed
her
so
often
before
.
The
soul
of
her
youth
clamored
for
its
*NL*
rights
;
for
a
share
in
the
world
's
glory
and
exultation
.
She
leaned
back
*NL*
and
drew
her
veil
a
little
closer
about
her
face
.
It
was
an
old
black
*NL*
veil
of
her
Aunt
Tavie
's
.
A
whiff
of
dust
from
the
road
had
blown
in
and
*NL*
she
wiped
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
with
her
soft
,
white
handkerchief
,
*NL*
a
homemade
handkerchief
,
fabricated
from
one
of
her
old
fine
muslin
*NL*
petticoats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
do
me
the
favor
,
Octavie
,
''
requested
the
judge
in
the
*NL*
courteous
tone
which
he
never
abandoned
,
``
to
remove
that
veil
which
you
*NL*
wear
.
It
seems
out
of
harmony
,
someway
,
with
the
beauty
and
promise
of
*NL*
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
obediently
yielded
to
her
old
companion
's
wish
and
*NL*
unpinning
the
cumbersome
,
sombre
drapery
from
her
bonnet
,
folded
it
*NL*
neatly
and
laid
it
upon
the
seat
in
front
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
that
is
better
;
far
better
!
''
he
said
in
a
tone
expressing
unbounded
*NL*
relief
.
``
Never
put
it
on
again
,
dear
.
''
Octavie
felt
a
little
hurt
;
as
if
*NL*
he
wished
to
debar
her
from
share
and
parcel
in
the
burden
of
affliction
*NL*
which
had
been
placed
upon
all
of
them
.
Again
she
drew
forth
the
old
*NL*
muslin
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
left
the
big
road
and
turned
into
a
level
plain
which
had
*NL*
formerly
been
an
old
meadow
.
There
were
clumps
of
thorn
trees
here
and
*NL*
there
,
gorgeous
in
their
spring
radiance
.
Some
cattle
were
grazing
off
*NL*
in
the
distance
in
spots
where
the
grass
was
tall
and
luscious
.
At
the
*NL*
far
end
of
the
meadow
was
the
towering
lilac
hedge
,
skirting
the
lane
*NL*
that
led
to
Judge
Pillier
's
house
,
and
the
scent
of
its
heavy
blossoms
*NL*
met
them
like
a
soft
and
tender
embrace
of
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
neared
the
house
the
old
gentleman
placed
an
arm
around
the
*NL*
girl
's
shoulders
and
turning
her
face
up
to
him
he
said
:
``
Do
you
not
*NL*
think
that
on
a
day
like
this
,
miracles
might
happen
?
When
the
whole
*NL*
earth
is
vibrant
with
life
,
does
it
not
seem
to
you
,
Octavie
,
that
*NL*
heaven
might
for
once
relent
and
give
us
back
our
dead
?
''
He
spoke
very
*NL*
low
,
advisedly
,
and
impressively
.
In
his
voice
was
an
old
quaver
which
*NL*
was
not
habitual
and
there
was
agitation
in
every
line
of
his
visage
.
*NL*
She
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
that
were
full
of
supplication
and
a
certain
*NL*
terror
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
driving
through
the
lane
with
the
towering
hedge
on
one
*NL*
side
and
the
open
meadow
on
the
other
.
The
horses
had
somewhat
quickened
*NL*
their
lazy
pace
.
As
they
turned
into
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
,
a
*NL*
whole
choir
of
feathered
songsters
fluted
a
sudden
torrent
of
melodious
*NL*
greeting
from
their
leafy
hiding
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
Octavie
felt
as
if
she
had
passed
into
a
stage
of
existence
which
was
*NL*
like
a
dream
,
more
poignant
and
real
than
life
.
There
was
the
old
gray
*NL*
house
with
its
sloping
eaves
.
Amid
the
blur
of
green
,
and
dimly
,
she
*NL*
saw
familiar
faces
and
heard
voices
as
if
they
came
from
far
across
the
*NL*
fields
,
and
Edmond
was
holding
her
.
Her
dead
Edmond
;
her
living
Edmond
,
*NL*
and
she
felt
the
beating
of
his
heart
against
her
and
the
agonizing
*NL*
rapture
of
his
kisses
striving
to
awake
her
.
It
was
as
if
the
spirit
of
*NL*
life
and
the
awakening
spring
had
given
back
the
soul
to
her
youth
and
*NL*
bade
her
rejoice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
many
hours
later
that
Octavie
drew
the
locket
from
her
bosom
and
*NL*
looked
at
Edmond
with
a
questioning
appeal
in
her
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
night
before
an
engagement
,
''
he
said
.
``
In
the
hurry
of
the
*NL*
encounter
,
and
the
retreat
next
day
,
I
never
missed
it
till
the
fight
*NL*
was
over
.
I
thought
of
course
I
had
lost
it
in
the
heat
of
the
struggle
,
*NL*
but
it
was
stolen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stolen
,
''
she
shuddered
,
and
thought
of
the
dead
soldier
with
his
face
*NL*
uplifted
to
the
sky
in
an
agony
of
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmond
said
nothing
;
but
he
thought
of
his
messmate
;
the
one
who
had
*NL*
lain
far
back
in
the
shadow
;
the
one
who
had
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
REFLECTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
people
are
born
with
a
vital
and
responsive
energy
.
It
not
only
*NL*
enables
them
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
;
it
qualifies
them
to
furnish
*NL*
in
their
own
personality
a
good
bit
of
the
motive
power
to
the
mad
*NL*
pace
.
They
are
fortunate
beings
.
They
do
not
need
to
apprehend
the
*NL*
significance
of
things
.
They
do
not
grow
weary
nor
miss
step
,
nor
do
*NL*
they
fall
out
of
rank
and
sink
by
the
wayside
to
be
left
contemplating
*NL*
the
moving
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
!
that
moving
procession
that
has
left
me
by
the
road-side
!
Its
*NL*
fantastic
colors
are
more
brilliant
and
beautiful
than
the
sun
on
the
*NL*
undulating
waters
.
What
matter
if
souls
and
bodies
are
failing
beneath
*NL*
the
feet
of
the
ever-pressing
multitude
!
It
moves
with
the
majestic
*NL*
rhythm
of
the
spheres
.
Its
discordant
clashes
sweep
upward
in
one
*NL*
harmonious
tone
that
blends
with
the
music
of
other
worlds
--
to
complete
*NL*
God
's
orchestra
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
greater
than
the
stars
--
that
moving
procession
of
human
energy
;
*NL*
greater
than
the
palpitating
earth
and
the
things
growing
thereon
.
Oh
!
*NL*
I
could
weep
at
being
left
by
the
wayside
;
left
with
the
grass
and
the
*NL*
clouds
and
a
few
dumb
animals
.
True
,
I
feel
at
home
in
the
society
of
*NL*
these
symbols
of
life
's
immutability
.
In
the
procession
I
should
*NL*
feel
the
crushing
feet
,
the
clashing
discords
,
the
ruthless
hands
and
*NL*
stifling
breath
.
I
could
not
hear
the
rhythm
of
the
march
.
*NL*
*NL*
Salve
!
ye
dumb
hearts
.
Let
us
be
still
and
wait
by
the
roadside
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
