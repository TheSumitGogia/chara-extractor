CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
towers
of
Zenith
aspired
above
the
morning
mist
;
austere
towers
of
*NL*
steel
and
cement
and
limestone
,
sturdy
as
cliffs
and
delicate
as
*NL*
silver
rods
.
They
were
neither
citadels
nor
churches
,
but
frankly
and
*NL*
beautifully
office-buildings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mist
took
pity
on
the
fretted
structures
of
earlier
generations
:
the
*NL*
Post
Office
with
its
shingle-tortured
mansard
,
the
red
brick
minarets
*NL*
of
hulking
old
houses
,
factories
with
stingy
and
sooted
windows
,
wooden
*NL*
tenements
colored
like
mud
.
The
city
was
full
of
such
grotesqueries
,
but
*NL*
the
clean
towers
were
thrusting
them
from
the
business
center
,
and
*NL*
on
the
farther
hills
were
shining
new
houses
,
homes
--
they
seemed
--
for
*NL*
laughter
and
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
a
concrete
bridge
fled
a
limousine
of
long
sleek
hood
and
noiseless
*NL*
engine
.
These
people
in
evening
clothes
were
returning
from
an
all-night
*NL*
rehearsal
of
a
Little
Theater
play
,
an
artistic
adventure
considerably
*NL*
illuminated
by
champagne
.
Below
the
bridge
curved
a
railroad
,
a
maze
*NL*
of
green
and
crimson
lights
.
The
New
York
Flyer
boomed
past
,
and
twenty
*NL*
lines
of
polished
steel
leaped
into
the
glare
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
skyscrapers
the
wires
of
the
Associated
Press
were
closing
*NL*
down
.
The
telegraph
operators
wearily
raised
their
celluloid
eye-shades
*NL*
after
a
night
of
talking
with
Paris
and
Peking
.
Through
the
building
*NL*
crawled
the
scrubwomen
,
yawning
,
their
old
shoes
slapping
.
The
dawn
mist
*NL*
spun
away
.
Cues
of
men
with
lunch-boxes
clumped
toward
the
immensity
of
*NL*
new
factories
,
sheets
of
glass
and
hollow
tile
,
glittering
shops
where
*NL*
five
thousand
men
worked
beneath
one
roof
,
pouring
out
the
honest
wares
*NL*
that
would
be
sold
up
the
Euphrates
and
across
the
veldt
.
The
whistles
*NL*
rolled
out
in
greeting
a
chorus
cheerful
as
the
April
dawn
;
the
song
of
*NL*
labor
in
a
city
built
--
it
seemed
--
for
giants
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
of
the
giant
in
the
aspect
of
the
man
who
was
*NL*
beginning
to
awaken
on
the
sleeping-porch
of
a
Dutch
Colonial
house
in
*NL*
that
residential
district
of
Zenith
known
as
Floral
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
name
was
George
F.
Babbitt
.
He
was
forty-six
years
old
now
,
in
*NL*
April
,
1920
,
and
he
made
nothing
in
particular
,
neither
butter
nor
shoes
*NL*
nor
poetry
,
but
he
was
nimble
in
the
calling
of
selling
houses
for
more
*NL*
than
people
could
afford
to
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
large
head
was
pink
,
his
brown
hair
thin
and
dry
.
His
face
was
*NL*
babyish
in
slumber
,
despite
his
wrinkles
and
the
red
spectacle-dents
on
*NL*
the
slopes
of
his
nose
.
He
was
not
fat
but
he
was
exceedingly
well
fed
;
*NL*
his
cheeks
were
pads
,
and
the
unroughened
hand
which
lay
helpless
upon
*NL*
the
khaki-colored
blanket
was
slightly
puffy
.
He
seemed
prosperous
,
*NL*
extremely
married
and
unromantic
;
and
altogether
unromantic
appeared
*NL*
this
sleeping-porch
,
which
looked
on
one
sizable
elm
,
two
respectable
*NL*
grass-plots
,
a
cement
driveway
,
and
a
corrugated
iron
garage
.
Yet
*NL*
Babbitt
was
again
dreaming
of
the
fairy
child
,
a
dream
more
romantic
*NL*
than
scarlet
pagodas
by
a
silver
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
the
fairy
child
had
come
to
him
.
Where
others
saw
but
Georgie
*NL*
Babbitt
,
she
discerned
gallant
youth
.
She
waited
for
him
,
in
the
*NL*
darkness
beyond
mysterious
groves
.
When
at
last
he
could
slip
away
from
*NL*
the
crowded
house
he
darted
to
her
.
His
wife
,
his
clamoring
friends
,
*NL*
sought
to
follow
,
but
he
escaped
,
the
girl
fleet
beside
him
,
and
they
*NL*
crouched
together
on
a
shadowy
hillside
.
She
was
so
slim
,
so
white
,
so
*NL*
eager
!
She
cried
that
he
was
gay
and
valiant
,
that
she
would
wait
for
*NL*
him
,
that
they
would
sail
--
*NL*
*NL*
Rumble
and
bang
of
the
milk-truck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
moaned
;
turned
over
;
struggled
back
toward
his
dream
.
He
could
*NL*
see
only
her
face
now
,
beyond
misty
waters
.
The
furnace-man
slammed
the
*NL*
basement
door
.
A
dog
barked
in
the
next
yard
.
As
Babbitt
sank
blissfully
*NL*
into
a
dim
warm
tide
,
the
paper-carrier
went
by
whistling
,
and
the
*NL*
rolled-up
Advocate
thumped
the
front
door
.
Babbitt
roused
,
his
stomach
*NL*
constricted
with
alarm
.
As
he
relaxed
,
he
was
pierced
by
the
familiar
*NL*
and
irritating
rattle
of
some
one
cranking
a
Ford
:
snap-ah-ah
,
*NL*
snap-ah-ah
,
snap-ah-ah
.
Himself
a
pious
motorist
,
Babbitt
cranked
with
*NL*
the
unseen
driver
,
with
him
waited
through
taut
hours
for
the
roar
of
*NL*
the
starting
engine
,
with
him
agonized
as
the
roar
ceased
and
again
*NL*
began
the
infernal
patient
snap-ah-ah
--
a
round
,
flat
sound
,
a
shivering
*NL*
cold-morning
sound
,
a
sound
infuriating
and
inescapable
.
Not
till
the
*NL*
rising
voice
of
the
motor
told
him
that
the
Ford
was
moving
was
he
*NL*
released
from
the
panting
tension
.
He
glanced
once
at
his
favorite
tree
,
*NL*
elm
twigs
against
the
gold
patina
of
sky
,
and
fumbled
for
sleep
as
for
a
*NL*
drug
.
He
who
had
been
a
boy
very
credulous
of
life
was
no
longer
greatly
*NL*
interested
in
the
possible
and
improbable
adventures
of
each
new
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
escaped
from
reality
till
the
alarm-clock
rang
,
at
seven-twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
best
of
nationally
advertised
and
quantitatively
produced
*NL*
alarm-clocks
,
with
all
modern
attachments
,
including
cathedral
chime
,
*NL*
intermittent
alarm
,
and
a
phosphorescent
dial
.
Babbitt
was
proud
*NL*
of
being
awakened
by
such
a
rich
device
.
Socially
it
was
almost
as
*NL*
creditable
as
buying
expensive
cord
tires
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sulkily
admitted
now
that
there
was
no
more
escape
,
but
he
lay
and
*NL*
detested
the
grind
of
the
real-estate
business
,
and
disliked
his
family
,
*NL*
and
disliked
himself
for
disliking
them
.
The
evening
before
,
he
had
*NL*
played
poker
at
Vergil
Gunch
's
till
midnight
,
and
after
such
holidays
*NL*
he
was
irritable
before
breakfast
.
It
may
have
been
the
tremendous
*NL*
home-brewed
beer
of
the
prohibition-era
and
the
cigars
to
which
that
*NL*
beer
enticed
him
;
it
may
have
been
resentment
of
return
from
this
fine
,
*NL*
bold
man-world
to
a
restricted
region
of
wives
and
stenographers
,
and
of
*NL*
suggestions
not
to
smoke
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
bedroom
beside
the
sleeping-porch
,
his
wife
's
detestably
*NL*
cheerful
``
Time
to
get
up
,
Georgie
boy
,
''
and
the
itchy
sound
,
the
brisk
*NL*
and
scratchy
sound
,
of
combing
hairs
out
of
a
stiff
brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grunted
;
he
dragged
his
thick
legs
,
in
faded
baby-blue
pajamas
,
from
*NL*
under
the
khaki
blanket
;
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cot
,
running
his
*NL*
fingers
through
his
wild
hair
,
while
his
plump
feet
mechanically
felt
*NL*
for
his
slippers
.
He
looked
regretfully
at
the
blanket
--
forever
a
*NL*
suggestion
to
him
of
freedom
and
heroism
.
He
had
bought
it
for
a
camping
*NL*
trip
which
had
never
come
off
.
It
symbolized
gorgeous
loafing
,
gorgeous
*NL*
cursing
,
virile
flannel
shirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
creaked
to
his
feet
,
groaning
at
the
waves
of
pain
which
passed
*NL*
behind
his
eyeballs
.
Though
he
waited
for
their
scorching
recurrence
,
he
*NL*
looked
blurrily
out
at
the
yard
.
It
delighted
him
,
as
always
;
it
was
*NL*
the
neat
yard
of
a
successful
business
man
of
Zenith
,
that
is
,
it
was
*NL*
perfection
,
and
made
him
also
perfect
.
He
regarded
the
corrugated
*NL*
iron
garage
.
For
the
three-hundred-and-sixty-fifth
time
in
a
year
he
*NL*
reflected
,
``
No
class
to
that
tin
shack
.
Have
to
build
me
a
frame
garage
.
*NL*
But
by
golly
it
's
the
only
thing
on
the
place
that
is
n't
up-to-date
!
''
*NL*
While
he
stared
he
thought
of
a
community
garage
for
his
acreage
*NL*
development
,
Glen
Oriole
.
He
stopped
puffing
and
jiggling
.
His
arms
were
*NL*
akimbo
.
His
petulant
,
sleep-swollen
face
was
set
in
harder
lines
.
He
*NL*
suddenly
seemed
capable
,
an
official
,
a
man
to
contrive
,
to
direct
,
to
*NL*
get
things
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
vigor
of
his
idea
he
was
carried
down
the
hard
,
dean
,
*NL*
unused-looking
hall
into
the
bathroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
house
was
not
large
it
had
,
like
all
houses
on
Floral
*NL*
Heights
,
an
altogether
royal
bathroom
of
porcelain
and
glazed
tile
and
*NL*
metal
sleek
as
silver
.
The
towel-rack
was
a
rod
of
clear
glass
set
in
*NL*
nickel
.
The
tub
was
long
enough
for
a
Prussian
Guard
,
and
above
the
*NL*
set
bowl
was
a
sensational
exhibit
of
tooth-brush
holder
,
shaving-brush
*NL*
holder
,
soap-dish
,
sponge-dish
,
and
medicine-cabinet
,
so
glittering
and
*NL*
so
ingenious
that
they
resembled
an
electrical
instrument-board
.
But
the
*NL*
Babbitt
whose
god
was
Modern
Appliances
was
not
pleased
.
The
air
of
the
*NL*
bathroom
was
thick
with
the
smell
of
a
heathen
toothpaste
.
``
Verona
been
*NL*
at
it
again
!
`
Stead
of
sticking
to
Lilidol
,
like
I
've
re-peat-ed-ly
*NL*
asked
her
,
she
's
gone
and
gotten
some
confounded
stinkum
stuff
that
*NL*
makes
you
sick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bath-mat
was
wrinkled
and
the
floor
was
wet
.
-LRB-
His
daughter
Verona
*NL*
eccentrically
took
baths
in
the
morning
,
now
and
then
.
-RRB-
He
slipped
on
*NL*
the
mat
,
and
slid
against
the
tub
.
He
said
``
Damn
!
''
Furiously
he
snatched
*NL*
up
his
tube
of
shaving-cream
,
furiously
he
lathered
,
with
a
belligerent
*NL*
slapping
of
the
unctuous
brush
,
furiously
he
raked
his
plump
cheeks
*NL*
with
a
safety-razor
.
It
pulled
.
The
blade
was
dull
.
He
said
,
*NL*
``
Damn
--
oh
--
oh
--
damn
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hunted
through
the
medicine-cabinet
for
a
packet
of
new
razor-blades
*NL*
-LRB-
reflecting
,
as
invariably
,
``
Be
cheaper
to
buy
one
of
these
dinguses
and
*NL*
strop
your
own
blades
,
''
-RRB-
and
when
he
discovered
the
packet
,
behind
the
*NL*
round
box
of
bicarbonate
of
soda
,
he
thought
ill
of
his
wife
for
putting
*NL*
it
there
and
very
well
of
himself
for
not
saying
``
Damn
.
''
But
he
did
say
*NL*
it
,
immediately
afterward
,
when
with
wet
and
soap-slippery
fingers
he
*NL*
tried
to
remove
the
horrible
little
envelope
and
crisp
clinging
oiled
*NL*
paper
from
the
new
blade
.
Then
there
was
the
problem
,
oft-pondered
,
*NL*
never
solved
,
of
what
to
do
with
the
old
blade
,
which
might
imperil
*NL*
the
fingers
of
his
young
.
As
usual
,
he
tossed
it
on
top
of
the
*NL*
medicine-cabinet
,
with
a
mental
note
that
some
day
he
must
remove
the
*NL*
fifty
or
sixty
other
blades
that
were
also
temporarily
,
piled
up
there
.
*NL*
He
finished
his
shaving
in
a
growing
testiness
increased
by
his
spinning
*NL*
headache
and
by
the
emptiness
in
his
stomach
.
When
he
was
done
,
his
*NL*
round
face
smooth
and
streamy
and
his
eyes
stinging
from
soapy
water
,
*NL*
he
reached
for
a
towel
.
The
family
towels
were
wet
,
wet
and
clammy
and
*NL*
vile
,
all
of
them
wet
,
he
found
,
as
he
blindly
snatched
them
--
his
*NL*
own
face-towel
,
his
wife
's
,
Verona
's
,
Ted
's
,
Tinka
's
,
and
the
lone
*NL*
bath-towel
with
the
huge
welt
of
initial
.
Then
George
F.
Babbitt
did
*NL*
a
dismaying
thing
.
He
wiped
his
face
on
the
guest-towel
!
It
was
a
*NL*
pansy-embroidered
trifle
which
always
hung
there
to
indicate
that
the
*NL*
Babbitts
were
in
the
best
Floral
Heights
society
.
No
one
had
ever
used
*NL*
it
.
No
guest
had
ever
dared
to
.
Guests
secretively
took
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
nearest
regular
towel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
raging
,
``
By
golly
,
here
they
go
and
use
up
all
the
towels
,
every
*NL*
doggone
one
of
'em
,
and
they
use
'em
and
get
'em
all
wet
and
sopping
,
*NL*
and
never
put
out
a
dry
one
for
me
--
of
course
,
I
'm
the
goat
!
--
and
then
*NL*
I
want
one
and
--
I
'm
the
only
person
in
the
doggone
house
that
's
got
*NL*
the
slightest
doggone
bit
of
consideration
for
other
people
and
*NL*
thoughtfulness
and
consider
there
may
be
others
that
may
want
to
use
the
*NL*
doggone
bathroom
after
me
and
consider
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
pitching
the
chill
abominations
into
the
bath-tub
,
pleased
by
*NL*
the
vindictiveness
of
that
desolate
flapping
sound
;
and
in
the
midst
his
*NL*
wife
serenely
trotted
in
,
observed
serenely
,
``
Why
Georgie
dear
,
what
are
*NL*
you
doing
?
Are
you
going
to
wash
out
the
towels
?
Why
,
you
need
n't
wash
*NL*
out
the
towels
.
Oh
,
Georgie
,
you
did
n't
go
and
use
the
guest-towel
,
did
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
recorded
that
he
was
able
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
weeks
he
was
sufficiently
roused
by
his
wife
to
*NL*
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Myra
Babbitt
--
Mrs.
George
F.
Babbitt
--
was
definitely
mature
.
She
had
*NL*
creases
from
the
corners
of
her
mouth
to
the
bottom
of
her
chin
,
and
her
*NL*
plump
neck
bagged
.
But
the
thing
that
marked
her
as
having
passed
the
*NL*
line
was
that
she
no
longer
had
reticences
before
her
husband
,
and
no
*NL*
longer
worried
about
not
having
reticences
.
She
was
in
a
petticoat
now
,
*NL*
and
corsets
which
bulged
,
and
unaware
of
being
seen
in
bulgy
corsets
.
*NL*
She
had
become
so
dully
habituated
to
married
life
that
in
her
full
*NL*
matronliness
she
was
as
sexless
as
an
anemic
nun
.
She
was
a
good
woman
,
*NL*
a
kind
woman
,
a
diligent
woman
,
but
no
one
,
save
perhaps
Tinka
her
*NL*
ten-year-old
,
was
at
all
interested
in
her
or
entirely
aware
that
she
*NL*
was
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
rather
thorough
discussion
of
all
the
domestic
and
social
*NL*
aspects
of
towels
she
apologized
to
Babbitt
for
his
having
an
alcoholic
*NL*
headache
;
and
he
recovered
enough
to
endure
the
search
for
a
B.V.D.
*NL*
undershirt
which
had
,
he
pointed
out
,
malevolently
been
concealed
among
*NL*
his
clean
pajamas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fairly
amiable
in
the
conference
on
the
brown
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
,
Myra
?
''
He
pawed
at
the
clothes
hunched
on
a
chair
in
*NL*
their
bedroom
,
while
she
moved
about
mysteriously
adjusting
and
patting
*NL*
her
petticoat
and
,
to
his
jaundiced
eye
,
never
seeming
to
get
on
with
*NL*
her
dressing
.
``
How
about
it
?
Shall
I
wear
the
brown
suit
another
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
looks
awfully
nice
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
gosh
,
it
needs
pressing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
Perhaps
it
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
certainly
could
stand
being
pressed
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
it
would
n't
hurt
it
to
be
pressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
gee
,
the
coat
does
n't
need
pressing
.
No
sense
in
having
the
whole
*NL*
darn
suit
pressed
,
when
the
coat
does
n't
need
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
pants
certainly
need

all
right

Look
at
them
--
look
at
those
*NL*
wrinkles

pants
certainly
do
need
pressing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
Oh
,
Georgie
,
why
could
n't
you
wear
the
brown
coat
with
the
*NL*
blue
trousers
we
were
wondering
what
we
'd
do
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
Did
you
ever
in
all
my
life
know
me
to
wear
the
coat
of
*NL*
one
suit
and
the
pants
of
another
?
What
do
you
think
I
am
?
A
busted
*NL*
bookkeeper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
do
n't
you
put
on
the
dark
gray
suit
to-day
,
and
stop
in
at

the
tailor
and
leave
the
brown
trousers
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

certainly

Now

the
devil
is
that
gray
suit

Oh

*NL*
yes

here
we
are

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
able
to
get
through
the
other
crises
of
dressing
with
comparative
*NL*
resoluteness
and
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
adornment
was
the
sleeveless
dimity
B.V.D.
undershirt
,
in
*NL*
which
he
resembled
a
small
boy
humorlessly
wearing
a
cheesecloth
tabard
*NL*
at
a
civic
pageant
.
He
never
put
on
B.V.D.
's
without
thanking
the
God
of
*NL*
Progress
that
he
did
n't
wear
tight
,
long
,
old-fashioned
undergarments
,
*NL*
like
his
father-in-law
and
partner
,
Henry
Thompson
.
His
second
*NL*
embellishment
was
combing
and
slicking
back
his
hair
.
It
gave
him
a
*NL*
tremendous
forehead
,
arching
up
two
inches
beyond
the
former
hair-line
.
*NL*
But
most
wonder-working
of
all
was
the
donning
of
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
character
in
spectacles
--
the
pretentious
tortoiseshell
,
the
*NL*
meek
pince-nez
of
the
school
teacher
,
the
twisted
silver-framed
glasses
*NL*
of
the
old
villager
.
Babbitt
's
spectacles
had
huge
,
circular
,
frameless
*NL*
lenses
of
the
very
best
glass
;
the
ear-pieces
were
thin
bars
of
gold
.
In
*NL*
them
he
was
the
modern
business
man
;
one
who
gave
orders
to
clerks
and
*NL*
drove
a
car
and
played
occasional
golf
and
was
scholarly
in
regard
to
*NL*
Salesmanship
.
His
head
suddenly
appeared
not
babyish
but
weighty
,
and
*NL*
you
noted
his
heavy
,
blunt
nose
,
his
straight
mouth
and
thick
,
long
*NL*
upper
lip
,
his
chin
overfleshy
but
strong
;
with
respect
you
beheld
him
*NL*
put
on
the
rest
of
his
uniform
as
a
Solid
Citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gray
suit
was
well
cut
,
well
made
,
and
completely
undistinguished
.
*NL*
It
was
a
standard
suit
.
White
piping
on
the
V
of
the
vest
added
a
flavor
*NL*
of
law
and
learning
.
His
shoes
were
black
laced
boots
,
good
boots
,
*NL*
honest
boots
,
standard
boots
,
extraordinarily
uninteresting
boots
.
*NL*
The
only
frivolity
was
in
his
purple
knitted
scarf
.
With
considerable
*NL*
comment
on
the
matter
to
Mrs.
Babbitt
-LRB-
who
,
acrobatically
fastening
the
*NL*
back
of
her
blouse
to
her
skirt
with
a
safety-pin
,
did
not
hear
a
word
*NL*
he
said
-RRB-
,
he
chose
between
the
purple
scarf
and
a
tapestry
effect
*NL*
with
stringless
brown
harps
among
blown
palms
,
and
into
it
he
thrust
a
*NL*
snake-head
pin
with
opal
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sensational
event
was
changing
from
the
brown
suit
to
the
gray
the
*NL*
contents
of
his
pockets
.
He
was
earnest
about
these
objects
.
They
were
*NL*
of
eternal
importance
,
like
baseball
or
the
Republican
Party
.
They
*NL*
included
a
fountain
pen
and
a
silver
pencil
-LRB-
always
lacking
a
supply
of
*NL*
new
leads
-RRB-
which
belonged
in
the
righthand
upper
vest
pocket
.
Without
*NL*
them
he
would
have
felt
naked
.
On
his
watch-chain
were
a
gold
penknife
,
*NL*
silver
cigar-cutter
,
seven
keys
-LRB-
the
use
of
two
of
which
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
-RRB-
,
and
incidentally
a
good
watch
.
Depending
from
the
chain
was
*NL*
a
large
,
yellowish
elk
's
-
tooth-proclamation
of
his
membership
in
the
*NL*
Brotherly
and
Protective
Order
of
Elks
.
Most
significant
of
all
was
his
*NL*
loose-leaf
pocket
note-book
,
that
modern
and
efficient
note-book
*NL*
which
contained
the
addresses
of
people
whom
he
had
forgotten
,
prudent
*NL*
memoranda
of
postal
money-orders
which
had
reached
their
destinations
*NL*
months
ago
,
stamps
which
had
lost
their
mucilage
,
clippings
of
verses
by
*NL*
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
and
of
the
newspaper
editorials
from
which
Babbitt
*NL*
got
his
opinions
and
his
polysyllables
,
notes
to
be
sure
and
do
things
*NL*
which
he
did
not
intend
to
do
,
and
one
curious
inscription
--
D.S.S.
*NL*
D.M.Y.P.D.F.
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
no
cigarette-case
.
No
one
had
ever
happened
to
give
him
*NL*
one
,
so
he
had
n't
the
habit
,
and
people
who
carried
cigarette-cases
he
*NL*
regarded
as
effeminate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
,
he
stuck
in
his
lapel
the
Boosters
'
Club
button
.
With
the
*NL*
conciseness
of
great
art
the
button
displayed
two
words
:
``
Boosters-Pep
!
''
*NL*
It
made
Babbitt
feel
loyal
and
important
.
It
associated
him
with
Good
*NL*
Fellows
,
with
men
who
were
nice
and
human
,
and
important
in
business
*NL*
circles
.
It
was
his
V.C.
,
his
Legion
of
Honor
ribbon
,
his
Phi
Beta
Kappa
*NL*
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
subtleties
of
dressing
ran
other
complex
worries
.
``
I
feel
kind
*NL*
of
punk
this
morning
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
think
I
had
too
much
dinner
last
*NL*
evening
.
You
ought
n't
to
serve
those
heavy
banana
fritters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
asked
me
to
have
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
--
I
tell
you
,
when
a
fellow
gets
past
forty
he
has
to
look
*NL*
after
his
digestion
.
There
's
a
lot
of
fellows
that
do
n't
take
proper
*NL*
care
of
themselves
.
I
tell
you
at
forty
a
man
's
a
fool
or
his
doctor

I
*NL*
mean
,
his
own
doctor
.
Folks
do
n't
give
enough
attention
to
this
matter
*NL*
of
dieting
.
Now
I
think
--
Course
a
man
ought
to
have
a
good
meal
after
*NL*
the
day
's
work
,
but
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
both
of
us
if
we
took
*NL*
lighter
lunches

*NL*
*NL*
``

here
at

I
always
do
have
a
light
lunch

a
hog
of
myself

Yes

'd
have
a
swell
time
if
you
had
to
eat

truck

out

I
certainly
do
feel

this
morning

Funny

got
a
pain
down
here
on
the
left
side
--
but
*NL*
no
,
that
would
n't
be
appendicitis

would
it

Last
night
,
when
I
was
*NL*
driving
over
to
Verg
Gunch

,
I
felt
a
pain
in
my
stomach

too

Right
*NL*
here
it
was

kind
of
a
sharp
shooting
pain

I

Where
'd
that
dime
go
to

*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
serve
more
prunes
at
breakfast
?
Of
course
I
eat
an
apple
*NL*
every
evening
--
an
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away

still

in
business
and
--
Verona
just
exactly
as
bad
.
*NL*
Does
n't
know
what
she
wants
.
Well
,
well
,
come
on
!
Are
n't
you
ready
yet
?
*NL*
The
girl
rang
the
bell
three
minutes
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
followed
his
wife
,
Babbitt
stood
at
the
westernmost
window
of
*NL*
their
room
.
This
residential
settlement
,
Floral
Heights
,
was
on
a
rise
;
*NL*
and
though
the
center
of
the
city
was
three
miles
away
--
Zenith
had
*NL*
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
now
--
he
could
see
*NL*
the
top
of
the
Second
National
Tower
,
an
Indiana
limestone
building
of
*NL*
thirty-five
stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
shining
walls
rose
against
April
sky
to
a
simple
cornice
like
a
*NL*
streak
of
white
fire
.
Integrity
was
in
the
tower
,
and
decision
.
It
*NL*
bore
its
strength
lightly
as
a
tall
soldier
.
As
Babbitt
stared
,
*NL*
the
nervousness
was
soothed
from
his
face
,
his
slack
chin
lifted
in
*NL*
reverence
.
All
he
articulated
was
``
That
's
one
lovely
sight
!
''
but
he
was
*NL*
inspired
by
the
rhythm
of
the
city
;
his
love
of
it
renewed
.
He
beheld
*NL*
the
tower
as
a
temple-spire
of
the
religion
of
business
,
a
faith
*NL*
passionate
,
exalted
,
surpassing
common
men
;
and
as
he
clumped
down
to
*NL*
breakfast
he
whistled
the
ballad
``
Oh
,
by
gee
,
by
gosh
,
by
jingo
''
as
*NL*
though
it
were
a
hymn
melancholy
and
noble
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
RELIEVED
of
Babbitt
's
bumbling
and
the
soft
grunts
with
which
his
wife
*NL*
expressed
the
sympathy
she
was
too
experienced
to
feel
and
much
*NL*
too
experienced
not
to
show
,
their
bedroom
settled
instantly
into
*NL*
impersonality
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
on
the
sleeping-porch
.
It
served
both
of
them
as
dressing-room
,
*NL*
and
on
the
coldest
nights
Babbitt
luxuriously
gave
up
the
duty
of
being
*NL*
manly
and
retreated
to
the
bed
inside
,
to
curl
his
toes
in
the
warmth
*NL*
and
laugh
at
the
January
gale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
displayed
a
modest
and
pleasant
color-scheme
,
after
one
of
the
*NL*
best
standard
designs
of
the
decorator
who
``
did
the
interiors
''
for
most
*NL*
of
the
speculative-builders
'
houses
in
Zenith
.
The
walls
were
gray
,
the
*NL*
woodwork
white
,
the
rug
a
serene
blue
;
and
very
much
like
mahogany
was
*NL*
the
furniture
--
the
bureau
with
its
great
clear
mirror
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
's
*NL*
dressing-table
with
toilet-articles
of
almost
solid
silver
,
the
plain
*NL*
twin
beds
,
between
them
a
small
table
holding
a
standard
electric
*NL*
bedside
lamp
,
a
glass
for
water
,
and
a
standard
bedside
book
*NL*
with
colored
illustrations
--
what
particular
book
it
was
can
not
be
*NL*
ascertained
,
since
no
one
had
ever
opened
it
.
The
mattresses
were
firm
*NL*
but
not
hard
,
triumphant
modern
mattresses
which
had
cost
a
great
deal
*NL*
of
money
;
the
hot-water
radiator
was
of
exactly
the
proper
scientific
*NL*
surface
for
the
cubic
contents
of
the
room
.
The
windows
were
large
*NL*
and
easily
opened
,
with
the
best
catches
and
cords
,
and
Holland
*NL*
roller-shades
guaranteed
not
to
crack
.
It
was
a
masterpiece
among
*NL*
bedrooms
,
right
out
of
Cheerful
Modern
Houses
for
Medium
Incomes
.
Only
*NL*
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
Babbitts
,
nor
with
any
one
else
.
If
people
*NL*
had
ever
lived
and
loved
here
,
read
thrillers
at
midnight
and
lain
in
*NL*
beautiful
indolence
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
there
were
no
signs
of
it
.
It
*NL*
had
the
air
of
being
a
very
good
room
in
a
very
good
hotel
.
One
expected
*NL*
the
chambermaid
to
come
in
and
make
it
ready
for
people
who
would
stay
*NL*
but
one
night
,
go
without
looking
back
,
and
never
think
of
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
second
house
in
Floral
Heights
had
a
bedroom
precisely
like
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Babbitts
'
house
was
five
years
old
.
It
was
all
as
competent
*NL*
and
glossy
as
this
bedroom
.
It
had
the
best
of
taste
,
the
best
of
*NL*
inexpensive
rugs
,
a
simple
and
laudable
architecture
,
and
the
latest
*NL*
conveniences
.
Throughout
,
electricity
took
the
place
of
candles
and
*NL*
slatternly
hearth-fires
.
Along
the
bedroom
baseboard
were
three
plugs
*NL*
for
electric
lamps
,
concealed
by
little
brass
doors
.
In
the
halls
were
*NL*
plugs
for
the
vacuum
cleaner
,
and
in
the
living-room
plugs
for
the
piano
*NL*
lamp
,
for
the
electric
fan
.
The
trim
dining-room
-LRB-
with
its
admirable
oak
*NL*
buffet
,
its
leaded-glass
cupboard
,
its
creamy
plaster
walls
,
its
modest
*NL*
scene
of
a
salmon
expiring
upon
a
pile
of
oysters
-RRB-
had
plugs
which
*NL*
supplied
the
electric
percolator
and
the
electric
toaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
there
was
but
one
thing
wrong
with
the
Babbitt
house
:
It
was
not
*NL*
a
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Often
of
a
morning
Babbitt
came
bouncing
and
jesting
in
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
But
things
were
mysteriously
awry
to-day
.
As
he
pontifically
tread
the
*NL*
upper
hall
he
looked
into
Verona
's
bedroom
and
protested
,
``
What
's
the
*NL*
use
of
giving
the
family
a
high-class
house
when
they
do
n't
appreciate
*NL*
it
and
tend
to
business
and
get
down
to
brass
tacks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
marched
upon
them
:
Verona
,
a
dumpy
brown-haired
girl
of
twenty-two
,
*NL*
just
out
of
Bryn
Mawr
,
given
to
solicitudes
about
duty
and
sex
and
*NL*
God
and
the
unconquerable
bagginess
of
the
gray
sports-suit
she
was
now
*NL*
wearing
.
Ted
--
Theodore
Roosevelt
Babbitt
--
a
decorative
boy
of
seventeen
.
*NL*
Tinka
--
Katherine
--
still
a
baby
at
ten
,
with
radiant
red
hair
and
a
*NL*
thin
skin
which
hinted
of
too
much
candy
and
too
many
ice
cream
sodas
.
*NL*
Babbitt
did
not
show
his
vague
irritation
as
he
tramped
in
.
He
really
*NL*
disliked
being
a
family
tyrant
,
and
his
nagging
was
as
meaningless
as
it
*NL*
was
frequent
.
He
shouted
at
Tinka
,
``
Well
,
kittiedoolie
!
''
It
was
the
only
*NL*
pet
name
in
his
vocabulary
,
except
the
``
dear
''
and
``
hon.
''
with
which
he
*NL*
recognized
his
wife
,
and
he
flung
it
at
Tinka
every
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gulped
a
cup
of
coffee
in
the
hope
of
pacifying
his
stomach
and
his
*NL*
soul
.
His
stomach
ceased
to
feel
as
though
it
did
not
belong
to
him
,
*NL*
but
Verona
began
to
be
conscientious
and
annoying
,
and
abruptly
there
*NL*
returned
to
Babbitt
the
doubts
regarding
life
and
families
and
business
*NL*
which
had
clawed
at
him
when
his
dream-life
and
the
slim
fairy
girl
had
*NL*
fled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Verona
had
for
six
months
been
filing-clerk
at
the
Gruensberg
Leather
*NL*
Company
offices
,
with
a
prospect
of
becoming
secretary
to
Mr.
Gruensberg
*NL*
and
thus
,
as
Babbitt
defined
it
,
``
getting
some
good
out
of
your
*NL*
expensive
college
education
till
you
're
ready
to
marry
and
settle
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
said
Verona
:
``
Father
!
I
was
talking
to
a
classmate
of
mine
*NL*
that
's
working
for
the
Associated
Charities
--
oh
,
Dad
,
there
's
the
*NL*
sweetest
little
babies
that
come
to
the
milk-station
there
!
--
and
I
feel
*NL*
as
though
I
ought
to
be
doing
something
worth
while
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
`
worth
while
'
?
If
you
get
to
be
Gruensberg
's
*NL*
secretary
--
and
maybe
you
would
,
if
you
kept
up
your
shorthand
and
did
n't
*NL*
go
sneaking
off
to
concerts
and
talkfests
every
evening
--
I
guess
you
'll
*NL*
find
thirty-five
or
forty
bones
a
week
worth
while
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
--
oh
,
I
want
to

contribute
--
I
wish
I
were
working
in
a
*NL*
settlement-house
.
I
wonder
if
I
could
get
one
of
the
department-stores
*NL*
to
let
me
put
in
a
welfare-department
with
a
nice
rest-room
and
chintzes
*NL*
and
wicker
chairs
and
so
on
and
so
forth
.
Or
I
could
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
look
here
!
The
first
thing
you
got
to
understand
is
that
all
*NL*
this
uplift
and
flipflop
and
settlement-work
and
recreation
is
nothing
*NL*
in
God
's
world
but
the
entering
wedge
for
socialism
.
The
sooner
a
man
*NL*
learns
he
is
n't
going
to
be
coddled
,
and
he
need
n't
expect
a
lot
of
free
*NL*
grub
and
,
uh
,
all
these
free
classes
and
flipflop
and
doodads
for
his
*NL*
kids
unless
he
earns
'em
,
why
,
the
sooner
he
'll
get
on
the
job
and
*NL*
produce
--
produce
--
produce
!
That
's
what
the
country
needs
,
and
not
all
*NL*
this
fancy
stuff
that
just
enfeebles
the
will-power
of
the
working
man
*NL*
and
gives
his
kids
a
lot
of
notions
above
their
class
.
And
you
--
if
you
'd
*NL*
tend
to
business
instead
of
fooling
and
fussing
--
All
the
time
!
When
I
*NL*
was
a
young
man
I
made
up
my
mind
what
I
wanted
to
do
,
and
stuck
to
it
*NL*
through
thick
and
thin
,
and
that
's
why
I
'm
where
I
am
to-day
,
and
--
Myra
!
*NL*
What
do
you
let
the
girl
chop
the
toast
up
into
these
dinky
little
*NL*
chunks
for
?
Ca
n't
get
your
fist
onto
'em

Half
cold

*NL*
*NL*
Ted
Babbitt
,
junior
in
the
great
East
Side
High
School
,
had
been
making
*NL*
hiccup-like
sounds
of
interruption

He
blurted
now
,
``

whirled

Not

was
Ted
lofty
with
her

He
was
a
natural

mechanic

lisped
in

Babbitt
flung
in
mechanically

as
he
lighted
the

gloriously
satisfying
first
cigar
of
the

tasted
the
exhilarating

drug
of

negotiated

Somewhat
later

persuaded

merely
going

Ted
planned
,
to
park
the
car
in
front
of
the
*NL*
candy-store
across
from
the
Armory
and
he
would
pick
it
up
.
There
were
*NL*
masterly
arrangements
regarding
leaving
the
key
,
and
having
the
gasoline
*NL*
tank
filled
;
and
passionately
,
devotees
of
the
Great
God
Motor
,
they
*NL*
hymned
the
patch
on
the
spare
inner-tube
,
and
the
lost
jack-handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Their
truce
dissolving
,
Ted
observed
that
her
friends
were
``
a
scream
of
*NL*
a
bunch-stuck-up
gabby
four-flushers
.
''
His
friends
,
she
indicated
,
*NL*
were
``
disgusting
imitation
sports
,
and
horrid
little
shrieking
ignorant
*NL*
girls
.
''
Further
:
``
It
's
disgusting
of
you
to
smoke
cigarettes
,
and
so
on
*NL*
and
so
forth
,
and
those
clothes
you
've
got
on
this
morning
,
they
're
too
*NL*
utterly
ridiculous
--
honestly
,
simply
disgusting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ted
balanced
over
to
the
low
beveled
mirror
in
the
buffet
,
regarded
his
*NL*
charms
,
and
smirked
.
His
suit
,
the
latest
thing
in
Old
Eli
Togs
,
was
*NL*
skin-tight
,
with
skimpy
trousers
to
the
tops
of
his
glaring
tan
boots
,
a
*NL*
chorus-man
waistline
,
pattern
of
an
agitated
check
,
and
across
the
back
*NL*
a
belt
which
belted
nothing
.
His
scarf
was
an
enormous
black
silk
wad
.
*NL*
His
flaxen
hair
was
ice-smooth
,
pasted
back
without
parting
.
When
he
*NL*
went
to
school
he
would
add
a
cap
with
a
long
vizor
like
a
shovel-blade
.
*NL*
Proudest
of
all
was
his
waistcoat
,
saved
for
,
begged
for
,
plotted
for
;
*NL*
a
real
Fancy
Vest
of
fawn
with
polka
dots
of
a
decayed
red
,
the
points
*NL*
astoundingly
long
.
On
the
lower
edge
of
it
he
wore
a
high-school
button
,
*NL*
a
class
button
,
and
a
fraternity
pin
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
none
of
it
mattered
.
He
was
supple
and
swift
and
flushed
;
his
eyes
*NL*
-LRB-
which
he
believed
to
be
cynical
-RRB-
were
candidly
eager
.
But
he
was
not
*NL*
over-gentle
.
He
waved
his
hand
at
poor
dumpy
Verona
and
drawled
:
``
Yes
,
I
*NL*
guess
we
're
pretty
ridiculous
and
disgusticulus
,
and
I
rather
guess
our
*NL*
new
necktie
is
some
smear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
barked
:
``
It
is
!
And
while
you
're
admiring
yourself
,
let
me
tell
*NL*
you
it
might
add
to
your
manly
beauty
if
you
wiped
some
of
that
egg
off
*NL*
your
mouth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Verona
giggled
,
momentary
victor
in
the
greatest
of
Great
Wars
,
which
*NL*
is
the
family
war
.
Ted
looked
at
her
hopelessly
,
then
shrieked
at
Tinka
:
*NL*
``
For
the
love
o
'
Pete
,
quit
pouring
the
whole
sugar
bowl
on
your
corn
*NL*
flakes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Verona
and
Ted
were
gone
and
Tinka
upstairs
,
Babbitt
groaned
to
his
*NL*
wife
:
``
Nice
family
,
I
must
say
!
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
any
baa-lamb
,
and
*NL*
maybe
I
'm
a
little
cross-grained
at
breakfast
sometimes
,
but
the
way
*NL*
they
go
on
jab-jab-jabbering
,
I
simply
ca
n't
stand
it
.
I
swear
,
I
feel
*NL*
like
going
off
some
place
where
I
can
get
a
little
peace
.
I
do
think
*NL*
after
a
man
's
spent
his
lifetime
trying
to
give
his
kids
a
chance
and
*NL*
a
decent
education
,
it
's
pretty
discouraging
to
hear
them
all
the
time
*NL*
scrapping
like
a
bunch
of
hyenas
and
never
--
and
never
--
Curious
;
here
*NL*
in
the
paper
it
says
--
Never
silent
for
one
mom
--
Seen
the
morning
paper
*NL*
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
.
''
In
twenty-three
years
of
married
life
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
had
seen
*NL*
the
paper
before
her
husband
just
sixty-seven
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
news

Terrible
big
tornado
in
the
South

Hard
luck
,
all
right

*NL*
But
this
,
say
,
this
is
corking
!
Beginning
of
the
end
for
those
fellows
!
*NL*
New
York
Assembly
has
passed
some
bills
that
ought
to
completely
outlaw
*NL*
the
socialists
!
And
there
's
an
elevator-runners
'
strike
in
New
York
and
*NL*
a
lot
of
college
boys
are
taking
their
places
.
That
's
the
stuff
!
And
*NL*
a
mass-meeting
in
Birmingham
's
demanded
that
this
Mick
agitator
,
this
*NL*
fellow
De
Valera
,
be
deported
.
Dead
right
,
by
golly
!
All
these
agitators
*NL*
paid
with
German
gold
anyway
.
And
we
got
no
business
interfering
with
*NL*
the
Irish
or
any
other
foreign
government
.
Keep
our
hands
strictly
off
.
*NL*
And
there
's
another
well-authenticated
rumor
from
Russia
that
Lenin
is
*NL*
dead
.
That
's
fine
.
It
's
beyond
me
why
we
do
n't
just
step
in
there
and
*NL*
kick
those
Bolshevik
cusses
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
says
here
a

*NL*

``
Humph

He
searched
for
an
attitude

but
neither
as
a

a

an

a

he
grunted
and
went
on

She
*NL*
looked
sympathetic

did
not

Later

would
read

Here
's
what
that
gushy
woman
reporter
says
about
*NL*
last
night
:
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Never

Society
with

big
S
more
flattered
than
when
they
are
*NL*
bidden
to
partake
of
good
cheer
at
the
distinguished
and
hospitable
*NL*
residence
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Charles
L.
McKelvey
as
they
were
last
night
.
*NL*
Set
in
its
spacious
lawns
and
landscaping
,
one
of
the
notable
sights
*NL*
crowning
Royal
Ridge
,
but
merry
and
homelike
despite
its
mighty
stone
*NL*
walls
and
its
vast
rooms
famed
for
their
decoration
,
their
home
was
*NL*
thrown
open
last
night
for
a
dance
in
honor
of
Mrs.
McKelvey
's
notable
*NL*
guest
,
Miss
J.
Sneeth
of
Washington
.
The
wide
hall
is
so
generous
in
*NL*
its
proportions
that
it
made
a
perfect
ballroom
,
its
hardwood
floor
*NL*
reflecting
the
charming
pageant
above
its
polished
surface
.
Even
*NL*
the
delights
of
dancing
paled
before
the
alluring
opportunities
for
*NL*
tete-a-tetes
that
invited
the
soul
to
loaf
in
the
long
library
before
*NL*
the
baronial
fireplace
,
or
in
the
drawing-room
with
its
deep
comfy
*NL*
armchairs
,
its
shaded
lamps
just
made
for
a
sly
whisper
of
pretty
*NL*
nothings
all
a
deux
;
or
even
in
the
billiard
room
where
one
could
take
*NL*
a
cue
and
show
a
prowess
at
still
another
game
than
that
sponsored
by
*NL*
Cupid
and
Terpsichore
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
,
a
great
deal
more
,
in
the
best
urban
journalistic
*NL*
style
of
Miss
Elnora
Pearl
Bates
,
the
popular
society
editor
of
the
*NL*
Advocate-Times
.
But
Babbitt
could
not
abide
it
.
He
grunted
.
He
wrinkled
*NL*
the
newspaper
.
He
protested
:
``
Can
you
beat
it
!
I
'm
willing
to
hand
a
lot
*NL*
of
credit
to
Charley
McKelvey
.
When
we
were
in
college
together
,
he
was
*NL*
just
as
hard
up
as
any
of
us
,
and
he
's
made
a
million
good
bucks
out
*NL*
of
contracting
and
has
n't
been
any
dishonester
or
bought
any
more
city
*NL*
councils
than
was
necessary
.
And
that
's
a
good
house
of
his
--
though
it
*NL*
ai
n't
any
`
mighty
stone
walls
'
and
it
ai
n't
worth
the
ninety
thousand
*NL*
it
cost
him
.
But
when
it
comes
to
talking
as
though
Charley
McKelvey
*NL*
and
all
that
booze-hoisting
set
of
his
are
any
blooming
bunch
of
of
,
of
*NL*
Vanderbilts
,
why
,
it
makes
me
tired
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Timidly
from
Mrs.
Babbitt
:
``
I
would
like
to
see
the
inside
of
their
*NL*
house
though
.
It
must
be
lovely
.
I
've
never
been
inside

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
have

Lots
of

couple
of
times
.
To
see
Chaz
about
business
*NL*
deals

in
the
evening

It
's
not
so
much
.
I
would
n't
WANT
to
go
there
to
*NL*
dinner
with
that
gang
of
,
of
high-binders
.
And
I
'll
bet
I
make
a
whole
*NL*
lot
more
money
than
some
of
those
tin-horns
that
spend
all
they
got
on
*NL*
dress-suits
and
have
n't
got
a
decent
suit
of
underwear
to
their
name
!
*NL*
Hey
!
What
do
you
think
of
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
strangely
unmoved
by
the
tidings
from
the
Real
Estate
*NL*
and
Building
column
of
the
Advocate-Times
:

And
this
morning
Babbitt
was
too
disquieted
to
entertain
her
with
items
*NL*
from
Mechanics
'
Liens
,
Mortgages
Recorded
,
and
Contracts
Awarded
.
He
*NL*
rose
.
As
he
looked
at
her
his
eyebrows
seemed
shaggier
than
usual
.
*NL*
Suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
maybe
--
Kind
of
shame
to
not
keep
in
touch
with
folks
like
the
*NL*
McKelveys
.
We
might
try
inviting
them
to
dinner
,
some
evening
.
Oh
,
*NL*
thunder
,
let
's
not
waste
our
good
time
thinking
about
'em
!
Our
little
*NL*
bunch
has
a
lot
liver
times
than
all
those
plutes
.
Just
compare
a
real
*NL*
human
like
you
with
these
neurotic
birds
like
Lucile
McKelvey
--
all
*NL*
highbrow
talk
and
dressed
up
like
a
plush
horse

You
're
a
great
old
*NL*
girl

*NL*
*NL*
He
covered
his
betrayal
of
softness
with
a
complaining
:
``
Say
,
do
n't
let
*NL*
Tinka
go
and
eat
any

appreciate
how
important
it
is
to
have
a
good
digestion

regular

Be
back

usual
time

I
guess

*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
--
he
did
n't
quite
kiss
her
--
he
laid
unmoving
lips
against
*NL*
her
unflushing
cheek
.
He
hurried
out
to
the
garage
,
muttering
:
``
Lord
,
*NL*
what
a
family

And
now
Myra
is
going

pathetic
on
me
because

sometimes
I

to
quit
the

worry

act
cranky

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
To
George
F.
Babbitt
,
as
to
most
prosperous
citizens
of
Zenith
,
his
*NL*
motor
car
was
poetry
and
tragedy
,
love
and
heroism
.
The
office
was
his
*NL*
pirate
ship
but
the
car
his
perilous
excursion
ashore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
tremendous
crises
of
each
day
none
was
more
dramatic
than
*NL*
starting
the
engine
.
It
was
slow
on
cold
mornings
;
there
was
the
long
,
*NL*
anxious
whirr
of
the
starter
;
and
sometimes
he
had
to
drip
ether
into
*NL*
the
cocks
of
the
cylinders
,
which
was
so
very
interesting
that
at
lunch
*NL*
he
would
chronicle
it
drop
by
drop
,
and
orally
calculate
how
much
each
*NL*
drop
had
cost
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
he
was
darkly
prepared
to
find
something
wrong
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
belittled
when
the
mixture
exploded
sweet
and
strong
,
and
the
car
did
n't
*NL*
even
brush
the
door-jamb
,
gouged
and
splintery
with
many
bruisings
by
*NL*
fenders
,
as
he
backed
out
of
the
garage
.
He
was
confused
.
He
shouted
*NL*
``
Morning
!
''
to
Sam
Doppelbrau
with
more
cordiality
than
he
had
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
green
and
white
Dutch
Colonial
house
was
one
of
three
in
that
*NL*
block
on
Chatham
Road
.
To
the
left
of
it
was
the
residence
of
Mr.
Samuel
*NL*
Doppelbrau
,
secretary
of
an
excellent
firm
of
bathroom-fixture
jobbers
.
*NL*
His
was
a
comfortable
house
with
no
architectural
manners
whatever
;
a
*NL*
large
wooden
box
with
a
squat
tower
,
a
broad
porch
,
and
glossy
paint
*NL*
yellow
as
a
yolk
.
Babbitt
disapproved
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Doppelbrau
as
*NL*
``
Bohemian
.
''
From
their
house
came
midnight
music
and
obscene
laughter
;
*NL*
there
were
neighborhood
rumors
of
bootlegged
whisky
and
fast
motor
*NL*
rides
.
They
furnished
Babbitt
with
many
happy
evenings
of
discussion
,
*NL*
during
which
he
announced
firmly
,
``
I
'm
not
strait-laced
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
mind
seeing
a
fellow
throw
in
a
drink
once
in
a
while
,
but
when
it
comes
*NL*
to
deliberately
trying
to
get
away
with
a
lot
of
hell-raising
all
the
*NL*
while
like
the
Doppelbraus
do
,
it
's
too
rich
for
my
blood
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
side
of
Babbitt
lived
Howard
Littlefield
,
Ph.D.
,
in
a
*NL*
strictly
modern
house
whereof
the
lower
part
was
dark
red
tapestry
*NL*
brick
,
with
a
leaded
oriel
,
the
upper
part
of
pale
stucco
like
spattered
*NL*
clay
,
and
the
roof
red-tiled
.
Littlefield
was
the
Great
Scholar
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
;
the
authority
on
everything
in
the
world
except
babies
,
*NL*
cooking
,
and
motors
.
He
was
a
Bachelor
of
Arts
of
Blodgett
College
,
*NL*
and
a
Doctor
of
Philosophy
in
economics
of
Yale
.
He
was
the
*NL*
employment-manager
and
publicity-counsel
of
the
Zenith
Street
Traction
*NL*
Company
.
He
could
,
on
ten
hours

aldermen

and
prove
,
absolutely
,
with
figures
*NL*
all
in
rows
and
with
precedents
from
Poland
and
New
Zealand
,
that
the
*NL*
street-car
company
loved
the
Public
and
yearned
over
its
employees
;
*NL*
that
all
its
stock
was
owned
by
Widows
and
Orphans
;
and
that
whatever
it
*NL*
desired
to
do
would
benefit
property-owners
by
increasing
rental
values
,
*NL*
and
help
the
poor
by
lowering
rents
.
All
his
acquaintances
turned
*NL*
to
Littlefield
when
they
desired
to
know
the
date
of
the
battle
of
*NL*
Saragossa
,
the
definition
of
the
word
``
sabotage
,
''
the
future
of
the
*NL*
German
mark
,
the
translation
of
``
hinc
illae
lachrimae
,
''
or
the
number
of
*NL*
products
of
coal
tar
.
He
awed
Babbitt
by
confessing
that
he
often
sat
up
*NL*
till
midnight
reading
the
figures
and
footnotes
in
Government
reports
,
*NL*
or
skimming
-LRB-
with
amusement
at
the
author
's
mistakes
-RRB-
the
latest
volumes
*NL*
of
chemistry
,
archeology
,
and
ichthyology
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Littlefield
's
great
value
was
as
a
spiritual
example
.
Despite
*NL*
his
strange
learnings
he
was
as
strict
a
Presbyterian
and
as
firm
a
*NL*
Republican
as
George
F.
Babbitt
.
He
confirmed
the
business
men
in
the
*NL*
faith
.
Where
they
knew
only
by
passionate
instinct
that
their
system
of
*NL*
industry
and
manners
was
perfect
,
Dr.
Howard
Littlefield
proved
it
*NL*
to
them
,
out
of
history
,
economics
,
and
the
confessions
of
reformed
*NL*
radicals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
a
good
deal
of
honest
pride
in
being
the
neighbor
of
such
a
*NL*
savant
,
and
in
Ted
's
intimacy
with
Eunice
Littlefield
.
At
sixteen
*NL*
Eunice
was
interested
in
no
statistics
save
those
regarding
the
ages
*NL*
and
salaries
of
motion-picture
stars
,
but
--
as
Babbitt
definitively
put
*NL*
it
--
``
she
was
her
father
's
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
difference
between
a
light
man
like
Sam
Doppelbrau
and
a
really
fine
*NL*
character
like
Littlefield
was
revealed
in
their
appearances
.
Doppelbrau
*NL*
was
disturbingly
young
for
a
man
of
forty-eight
.
He
wore
his
derby
on
*NL*
the
back
of
his
head
,
and
his
red
face
was
wrinkled
with
meaningless
*NL*
laughter
.
But
Littlefield
was
old
for
a
man
of
forty-two
.
He
was
tall
,
*NL*
broad
,
thick
;
his
gold-rimmed
spectacles
were
engulfed
in
the
folds
of
*NL*
his
long
face
;
his
hair
was
a
tossed
mass
of
greasy
blackness
;
he
puffed
*NL*
and
rumbled
as
he
talked
;
his
Phi
Beta
Kappa
key
shone
against
a
spotty
*NL*
black
vest
;
he
smelled
of
old
pipes
;
he
was
altogether
funereal
*NL*
and
archidiaconal
;
and
to
real-estate
brokerage
and
the
jobbing
of
*NL*
bathroom-fixtures
he
added
an
aroma
of
sanctity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
he
was
in
front
of
his
house
,
inspecting
the
grass
parking
*NL*
between
the
curb
and
the
broad
cement
sidewalk
.
Babbitt
stopped
his
car
*NL*
and
leaned
out
to
shout
``
Mornin
'
!
''
Littlefield
lumbered
over
and
stood
*NL*
with
one
foot
up
on
the
running-board
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
morning
,
''
said
Babbitt
,
lighting
--
illegally
early
--
his
second
*NL*
cigar
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
a
mighty
fine
morning
,
''
said
Littlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spring

fast
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's

now

said
Littlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
cold

Had
to
have
a

on
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
was

any

Littlefield

*NL*
*NL*

But
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
still
,
there
was
snow
at
Tiflis
,
Montana
,
yesterday
,
''
said
the
*NL*
Scholar
,
``
and
you
remember
the
blizzard
they
had
out
West
three
days
*NL*
ago
--
thirty
inches
of
snow
at
Greeley

Colorado
--
and
two
years
ago
we
*NL*
had
a
snow-squall
right
here
in
Zenith
on
the
twenty-fifth
of
April

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that

Say

what
do
you
think
about
the
Republican
*NL*
candidate

Who
'll
they
nominate
for

Do
n't
you
think
it
's
*NL*
about
time
we
had
a
real

administration

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
opinion

what
the
country
needs

first
and
foremost
,
is
a
good

conduct
of
its

Littlefield

*NL*
*NL*
``

What
the

just
at
this

juncture

is
neither
a

a

of
monkeying
with
foreign

a
good

will
give

have
*NL*
something

*NL*
``
Yes

generally
realized

in

you
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is

Well

breathed
Babbitt
,
feeling
much
calmer
,
and
*NL*
much
happier
about
the
way
things
were
going
in
the
world
.
``
Well

it

*NL*
been

I
'll
have

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
labored
,
these
solid
citizens
.
Twenty
years
before
,
the
hill
*NL*
on
which
Floral
Heights
was
spread
,
with
its
bright
roofs
and
immaculate
*NL*
turf
and
amazing
comfort
,
had
been
a
wilderness
of
rank
second-growth
*NL*
elms
and
oaks
and
maples
.
Along
the
precise
streets
were
still
a
few
*NL*
wooded
vacant
lots
,
and
the
fragment
of
an
old
orchard
.
It
was
brilliant
*NL*
to-day
;
the
apple
boughs
were
lit
with
fresh
leaves
like
torches
of
*NL*
green
fire
.
The
first
white
of
cherry
blossoms
flickered
down
a
gully
,
*NL*
and
robins
clamored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
sniffed
the
earth
,
chuckled
at
the
hysteric
robins
as
he
would
*NL*
have
chuckled
at
kittens
or
at
a
comic
movie
.
He
was
,
to
the
eye
,
the
*NL*
perfect
office-going
executive
--
a
well-fed
man
in
a
correct
brown
soft
*NL*
hat
and
frameless
spectacles
,
smoking
a
large
cigar
,
driving
a
good
*NL*
motor
along
a
semi-suburban
parkway
.
But
in
him
was
some
genius
of
*NL*
authentic
love
for
his
neighborhood
,
his
city
,
his
clan
.
The
winter
was
*NL*
over
;
the
time
was
come
for
the
building
,
the
visible
growth
,
which
to
*NL*
him
was
glory
.
He
lost
his
dawn
depression
;
he
was
ruddily
cheerful
when
*NL*
he
stopped
on
Smith
Street
to
leave
the
brown
trousers
,
and
to
have
the
*NL*
gasoline-tank
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
familiarity
of
the
rite
fortified
him
:
the
sight
of
the
tall
red
*NL*
iron
gasoline-pump
,
the
hollow-tile
and
terra-cotta
garage
,
the
window
*NL*
full
of
the
most
agreeable
accessories
--
shiny
casings
,
spark-plugs
with
*NL*
immaculate
porcelain
jackets
tire-chains
of
gold
and
silver
.
He
was
*NL*
flattered
by
the
friendliness
with
which
Sylvester
Moon
,
dirtiest
and
*NL*
most
skilled
of
motor
mechanics
,
came
out
to
serve
him
.
``
Mornin
'
,
Mr.
*NL*
Babbitt
!
''
said
Moon
,
and
Babbitt
felt
himself
a
person
of
importance
,
*NL*
one
whose
name
even
busy
garagemen
remembered
--
not
one
of
these
*NL*
cheap-sports
flying
around
in
flivvers
.
He
admired
the
ingenuity
of
the
*NL*
automatic
dial
,
clicking
off
gallon
by
gallon
;
admired
the
smartness
*NL*
of
the
sign
:
``
A
fill
in
time
saves
getting
stuck
--
gas
to-day
31
cents
''
;
*NL*
admired
the
rhythmic
gurgle
of
the
gasoline
as
it
flowed
into
the
tank
,
*NL*
and
the
mechanical
regularity
with
which
Moon
turned
the
handle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
we
takin
'
to-day
?
''
asked
Moon
,
in
a
manner
which
combined
the
*NL*
independence
of
the
great
specialist
,
the
friendliness
of
a
familiar
*NL*
gossip
,
and
respect
for
a
man
of
weight
in
the
community
,
like
George
F.
*NL*
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fill
`
er
up

*NL*
*NL*
``

candidate

Mr.
Babbitt

*NL*
*NL*
``

too
early

make
any

After

*NL*
a

and
two
weeks
--
no

three
weeks
--
must
be
almost
three
*NL*
weeks

well
,
there
's
more
than
six
weeks
in
all
before
the
Republican
*NL*
convention
,

I
feel
a
fellow
ought
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
give
*NL*
all
the
candidates
a
show

look
'em
all
over

size
'em
up

then
*NL*

carefully

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fact

Mr.
Babbitt

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
'll
tell

stand
on

is
just

was

years
ago
,
and
eight
years
ago

and
it
'll
be
my
stand
four
years
from
*NL*
now
--
yes
,
and
eight
years
from
now
!
What
I
tell
everybody
,
and
it
ca
n't
*NL*
be
too
generally
understood
,
is
that
what
we
need
first
,
last

and
all
*NL*
the
time

a
good
,
sound
business
administration

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
golly
,
that
's
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do

tires

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
try

have
some
sense
about
it

''
Babbitt
paid
his
bill
,
*NL*
said
adequately
,
``
Oh
,
keep
the
change
,
''
and
drove
off
in
an
ecstasy
of
*NL*
honest
self-appreciation
.
It
was
with
the
manner
of
a
Good
Samaritan
*NL*
that
he
shouted
at
a
respectable-looking
man
who
was
waiting
for
a
*NL*
trolley
car
,
``
Have
a
lift
?
''
As
the
man
climbed
in
Babbitt
condescended
,
*NL*
``
Going
clear
down-town
?
Whenever
I
see
a
fellow
waiting

*NL*
I
always
make
it
a
practice
to
give
him
a
lift
--
unless
,
of
course
,
he
*NL*
looks
like
a
bum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
there
were
more
folks
that
were
so
generous
with
their
machines
,

*NL*
dutifully
said
the
victim
of
benevolence
.
``
Oh

no

tai
n't

question

*NL*
generosity

hardly

Fact

I
always
feel
--
I
was
saying
to
my
son
just
the
*NL*
other
night
--
it
's
a
fellow
's
duty
to
share
the
good
things
of
this
world
*NL*
with
his
neighbors
,
and
it
gets
my
goat
when
a
fellow
gets
stuck
*NL*
on
himself
and
goes
around
tooting
his
horn
merely
because
he
's
*NL*
charitable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
victim
seemed
unable
to
find
the
right
answer
.
Babbitt
boomed
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
punk
service

Company
giving
us

these
car-lines

Nonsense

Portland

mighty
cold

morning

waiting
on

street
corner

wind

*NL*
*NL*
``

give

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
alarmed
.
``
But
still
,
of
course
it
wo
n't
do
to
just
keep
*NL*
knocking
the
Traction
Company
and
not
realize
the
difficulties
they
're
*NL*
operating
under
,
like
these
cranks
that
want
municipal
ownership
.
The
*NL*
way
these
workmen
hold
up
the
Company
for
high
wages
is
simply
a
*NL*
crime
,
and
of
course
the
burden
falls
on
you

me

a
seven-cent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darn
fine
morning

Babbitt
explained
.
``
Spring

along
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
real
spring
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
victim
had
no
originality
,
no
wit
,
and
Babbitt
fell
into
a
great
*NL*
silence
and
devoted
himself
to
the
game
of
beating
trolley
cars
to
the
*NL*
corner
:
a
spurt
,
a
tail-chase
,
nervous
speeding
between
the
huge
yellow
*NL*
side
of
the
trolley
and
the
jagged
row
of
parked
motors
,
shooting
past
*NL*
just
as
the
trolley
stopped
--
a
rare
game
and
valiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
all
the
while
he
was
conscious
of
the
loveliness
of
Zenith
.
For
*NL*
weeks
together
he
noticed
nothing
but
clients
and
the
vexing
To
Rent
*NL*
signs
of
rival
brokers
.
To-day
,
in
mysterious
malaise
,
he
raged
or
*NL*
rejoiced
with
equal
nervous
swiftness
,
and
to-day
the
light
of
spring
*NL*
was
so
winsome
that
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
admired
each
district
along
his
familiar
route
to
the
office
:
The
*NL*
bungalows
and
shrubs
and
winding
irregular
drive
ways
of
Floral
Heights
.
*NL*
The
one-story
shops
on
Smith
Street
,
a
glare
of
plate-glass
and
new
*NL*
yellow
brick
;
groceries
and
laundries
and
drug-stores
to
supply
the
more
*NL*
immediate
needs
of
East
Side
housewives
.
The
market
gardens
in
Dutch
*NL*
Hollow
,
their
shanties
patched
with
corrugated
iron
and
stolen
doors
.
*NL*
Billboards
with
crimson
goddesses
nine
feet
tall
advertising
cinema
*NL*
films
,
pipe
tobacco
,
and
talcum
powder
.
The
old
``
mansions
''
along
Ninth
*NL*
Street
,
S.
E.
,
like
aged
dandies
in
filthy
linen
;
wooden
castles
turned
*NL*
into
boarding-houses
,
with
muddy
walks
and
rusty
hedges
,
jostled
*NL*
by
fast-intruding
garages
,
cheap
apartment-houses
,
and
fruit-stands
*NL*
conducted
by
bland
,
sleek
Athenians
.
Across
the
belt
of
railroad-tracks
,
*NL*
factories
with
high-perched
water-tanks
and
tall
stacks-factories
*NL*
producing
condensed
milk
,
paper
boxes
,
lighting-fixtures
,
motor
cars
.
*NL*
Then
the
business
center
,
the
thickening
darting
traffic
,
the
crammed
*NL*
trolleys
unloading
,
and
high
doorways
of
marble
and
polished
granite
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
big
--
and
Babbitt
respected
bigness
in
anything
;
in
mountains
,
*NL*
jewels
,
muscles
,
wealth
,
or
words
.
He
was
,
for
a
spring-enchanted
*NL*
moment
,
the
lyric
and
almost
unselfish
lover
of
Zenith
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
the
outlying
factory
suburbs
;
of
the
Chaloosa
River
with
its
strangely
*NL*
eroded
banks
;
of
the
orchard-dappled
Tonawanda
Hills
to
the
North
,
*NL*
and
all
the
fat
dairy
land
and
big
barns
and
comfortable
herds
.
As
he
*NL*
dropped
his
passenger
he
cried
,
``
Gosh
,
I
feel
pretty
good
this
morning
!
''
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
Epochal
as
starting
the
car
was
the
drama
of
parking
it
before
he
*NL*
entered
his
office
.
As
he
turned
from
Oberlin
Avenue
round
the
corner
*NL*
into
Third
Street
,
N.E.
,
he
peered
ahead
for
a
space
in
the
line
of
*NL*
parked
cars
.
He
angrily
just
missed
a
space
as
a
rival
driver
slid
into
*NL*
it
.
Ahead
,
another
car
was
leaving
the
curb
,
and
Babbitt
slowed
up
,
*NL*
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
cars
pressing
on
him
from
behind
,
agitatedly
*NL*
motioning
an
old
woman
to
go
ahead
,
avoiding
a
truck
which
bore
down
on
*NL*
him
from
one
side
.
With
front
wheels
nicking
the
wrought-steel
bumper
*NL*
of
the
car
in
front
,
he
stopped
,
feverishly
cramped
his
steering-wheel
,
*NL*
slid
back
into
the
vacant
space
and
,
with
eighteen
inches
of
room
,
*NL*
manoeuvered
to
bring
the
car
level
with
the
curb
.
It
was
a
virile
*NL*
adventure
masterfully
executed
.
With
satisfaction
he
locked
a
*NL*
thief-proof
steel
wedge
on
the
front
wheel
,
and
crossed
the
street
to
*NL*
his
real-estate
office
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
Reeves
Building
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reeves
Building
was
as
fireproof
as
a
rock
and
as
efficient
as
*NL*
a
typewriter
;
fourteen
stories
of
yellow
pressed
brick
,
with
clean
,
*NL*
upright
,
unornamented
lines
.
It
was
filled
with
the
offices
of
lawyers
,
*NL*
doctors
,
agents
for
machinery
,
for
emery
wheels
,
for
wire
fencing
,
for
*NL*
mining-stock
.
Their
gold
signs
shone
on
the
windows
.
The
entrance
was
*NL*
too
modern
to
be
flamboyant
with
pillars
;
it
was
quiet
,
shrewd
,
neat
.
*NL*
Along
the
Third
Street
side
were
a
Western
Union
Telegraph
Office
,
*NL*
the
Blue
Delft
Candy
Shop
,
Shotwell
's
Stationery
Shop
,
and
the
*NL*
Babbitt-Thompson
Realty
Company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
could
have
entered
his
office
from
the
street
,
as
customers
*NL*
did
,
but
it
made
him
feel
an
insider
to
go
through
the
corridor
of
*NL*
the
building
and
enter
by
the
back
door
.
Thus
he
was
greeted
by
the
*NL*
villagers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
unknown
people
who
inhabited
the
Reeves
Building
*NL*
corridors
--
elevator-runners
,
starter
,
engineers
,
superintendent
,
and
the
*NL*
doubtful-looking
lame
man
who
conducted
the
news
and
cigar
stand
--
were
*NL*
in
no
way
city-dwellers
.
They
were
rustics
,
living
in
a
constricted
*NL*
valley
,
interested
only
in
one
another
and
in
The
Building
.
Their
*NL*
Main
Street
was
the
entrance
hall
,
with
its
stone
floor
,
severe
marble
*NL*
ceiling
,
and
the
inner
windows
of
the
shops
.
The
liveliest
place
on
the
*NL*
street
was
the
Reeves
Building
Barber
Shop
,
but
this
was
also
Babbitt
's
*NL*
one
embarrassment
.
Himself
,
he
patronized
the
glittering
Pompeian
*NL*
Barber
Shop
in
the
Hotel
Thornleigh
,
and
every
time
he
passed
the
*NL*
Reeves
shop
--
ten
times
a
day
,
a
hundred
times
--
he
felt
untrue
to
his
own
*NL*
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
one
of
the
squirearchy
,
greeted
with
honorable
salutations
by
*NL*
the
villagers
,
he
marched
into
his
office
,
and
peace
and
dignity
were
*NL*
upon
him
,
and
the
morning
's
dissonances
all
unheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
heard
again
,
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stanley
Graff
,
the
outside
salesman
,
was
talking
on
the
telephone
with
*NL*
tragic
lack
of
that
firm
manner
which
disciplines
clients
:
``
Say
,
uh
,
I
*NL*
think
I
got
just
the
house
that
would
suit
you
--
the
Percival
House
,
in
*NL*
Linton
...
Oh
,
you
've
seen
it
.
Well
,
how
'd
it
strike
you
?
...
Huh
?
*NL*
...
Oh
,
''
irresolutely
,
``
oh
,
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Babbitt
marched
into
his
private
room
,
a
coop
with
semi-partition
of
*NL*
oak
and
frosted
glass
,
at
the
back
of
the
office
,
he
reflected
how
hard
*NL*
it
was
to
find
employees
who
had
his
own
faith
that
he
was
going
to
make
*NL*
sales
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
nine
members
of
the
staff
,
besides
Babbitt
and
his
partner
*NL*
and
father-in-law
,
Henry
Thompson
,
who
rarely
came
to
the
office
.
The
*NL*
nine
were
Stanley
Graff
,
the
outside
salesman
--
a
youngish
man
given
to
*NL*
cigarettes
and
the
playing
of
pool
;
old
Mat
Penniman
,
general
utility
*NL*
man
,
collector
of
rents
and
salesman
of
insurance
--
broken
,
silent
,
gray
;
*NL*
a
mystery
,
reputed
to
have
been
a
``
crack
''
real-estate
man
with
a
firm
*NL*
of
his
own
in
haughty
Brooklyn
;
Chester
Kirby
Laylock
,
resident
salesman
*NL*
out
at
the
Glen
Oriole
acreage
development
--
an
enthusiastic
person
with
*NL*
a
silky
mustache
and
much
family
;
Miss
Theresa
McGoun
,
the
swift
and
*NL*
rather
pretty
stenographer
;
Miss
Wilberta
Bannigan
,
the
thick
,
slow
,
*NL*
laborious
accountant
and
file-clerk
;
and
four
freelance
part-time
*NL*
commission
salesmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
looked
from
his
own
cage
into
the
main
room
Babbitt
mourned
,
*NL*
``
McGoun
's
a
good
stenog.
,
smart
's
a
whip
,
but
Stan
Graff
and
all
those
*NL*
bums
--
''
The
zest
of
the
spring
morning
was
smothered
in
the
stale
office
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Normally
he
admired
the
office
,
with
a
pleased
surprise
that
he
should
*NL*
have
created
this
sure
lovely
thing
;
normally
he
was
stimulated
by
*NL*
the
clean
newness
of
it
and
the
air
of
bustle
;
but
to-day
it
seemed
*NL*
flat
--
the
tiled
floor
,
like
a
bathroom
,
the
ocher-colored
metal
ceiling
,
*NL*
the
faded
maps
on
the
hard
plaster
walls
,
the
chairs
of
varnished
pale
*NL*
oak
,
the
desks
and
filing-cabinets
of
steel
painted
in
olive
drab
.
It
*NL*
was
a
vault
,
a
steel
chapel
where
loafing
and
laughter
were
raw
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
n't
even
any
satisfaction
in
the
new
water-cooler
!
And
it
was
the
*NL*
very
best
of
water-coolers
,
up-to-date
,
scientific
,
and
right-thinking
.
*NL*
It
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
-LRB-
in
itself
a
virtue
-RRB-
.
It
possessed
a
*NL*
non-conducting
fiber
ice-container
,
a
porcelain
water-jar
-LRB-
guaranteed
*NL*
hygienic
-RRB-
,
a
drip-less
non-clogging
sanitary
faucet
,
and
machine-painted
*NL*
decorations
in
two
tones
of
gold
.
He
looked
down
the
relentless
stretch
*NL*
of
tiled
floor
at
the
water-cooler
,
and
assured
himself
that
no
tenant
*NL*
of
the
Reeves
Building
had
a
more
expensive
one
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
recapture
the
feeling
of
social
superiority
it
had
given
him
.
He
*NL*
astoundingly
grunted
,
``
I
'd
like
to
beat
it
off
to
the
woods
right
now
.
*NL*
And
loaf
all
day
.
And
go
to
Gunch
's
again
to-night
,
and
play
poker
,
*NL*
and
cuss
as
much
as
I
feel
like
,
and
drink
a
hundred
and
nine-thousand
*NL*
bottles
of
beer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
;
he
read
through
his
mail
;
he
shouted
``
Msgoun
,
''
which
meant
*NL*
``
Miss
McGoun
''
;
and
began
to
dictate
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
his
own
version
of
his
first
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Omar
Gribble
,
send
it
to
his
office
,
Miss
McGoun
,
yours
of
twentieth
to

hand

in
reply
would
say
look
here
,
Gribble

I
'm
awfully
afraid
if
*NL*
we
go
on
shilly-shallying
like
this

'll
just
naturally

,
I
had
Allen
up
on
carpet
day
before
yesterday
and
got
right
down
*NL*
to
cases
and
think
I
can
assure
you
--
uh
,
uh
,
no
,
change
that
:
all
my
*NL*
experience
indicates
he
is
all
right

looked
into
*NL*
his
financial
record
which
is
fine
--
that
sentence
seems
to
be
a
little
*NL*
balled
up

make
a

sentences
out

This

the
version

*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mr.
Gribble
:
*NL*
*NL*
Your
letter
of
the
twentieth
to
hand
.
I
must
say
I
'm
awfully
afraid
that
*NL*
if
we
go
on
shilly-shallying
like
this
we
'll
just
naturally
lose
the
*NL*
Allen
sale
.
I
had
Allen
up
on
the
carpet
day
before
yesterday
,
and
got
*NL*
right
down
to
cases
.
All
my
experience
indicates
that
he
means
to
do
*NL*
business
.
I
have
also
looked
into
his
financial
record
,
which
is
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
perfectly
willing
to
pro
rate
the
special
assessment
and
there
*NL*
will
be
no
difficulty
in
getting
him
to
pay
for
title
insurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
SO
LET
'S
GO
!
Yours
sincerely
,
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
read
and
signed
it
,
in
his
correct
flowing
business-college
hand
,
*NL*
Babbitt
reflected
,
``
Now
that
's
a
good
,
strong
letter
,
and
clear
's
a
*NL*
bell
.
Now
what
the
--
I
never
told
McGoun
to
make
a
third
paragraph
there
!
*NL*
Wish
she
'd
quit
trying
to
improve
on
my
dictation
!
But
what
I
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
is
:
why
ca
n't
Stan
Graff
or
Chet
Laylock
write
a
letter
like
*NL*
that
?
With
punch
!
With
a
kick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
important
thing
he
dictated
that
morning
was
the
fortnightly
*NL*
form-letter
,
to
be
mimeographed
and
sent
out
to
a
thousand
``
prospects
.
''
*NL*
It
was
diligently
imitative
of
the
best
literary
models
of
the
day
;
of
*NL*
heart-to-heart-talk
advertisements
,
``
sales-pulling
''
letters
,
discourses
*NL*
on
the
``
development
of
Will-power
,
''
and
hand-shaking
house-organs
,
*NL*
as
richly
poured
forth
by
the
new
school
of
Poets
of
Business
.
He
had
*NL*
painfully
written
out
a
first
draft
,
and
he
intoned
it
now
like
a
poet
*NL*
delicate
and
distrait
:
*NL*
*NL*
SAY
,
OLD
MAN
!
I
just
want
to
know
can
I
do
you
a
whaleuva
favor
?
Honest
!
*NL*
No
kidding
!
I
know
you
're
interested
in
getting
a
house
,
not
merely
a
*NL*
place
where
you
hang
up
the
old
bonnet
but
a
love-nest
for
the
wife
and
*NL*
kiddies

for
the
flivver

Dictation
over
,
with
its
need
of
sitting
and
thinking
instead
of
*NL*
bustling
around
and
making
a
noise
and
really
doing
something
,
Babbitt
*NL*
sat
creakily
back
in
his
revolving
desk-chair
and
beamed
on
Miss
McGoun
.
*NL*
He
was
conscious
of
her
as
a
girl
,
of
black
bobbed
hair
against
demure
*NL*
cheeks
.
A
longing
which
was
indistinguishable
from
loneliness
enfeebled
*NL*
him
.
While
she
waited
,
tapping
a
long
,
precise
pencil-point
on
the
*NL*
desk-tablet
,
he
half
identified
her
with
the
fairy
girl
of
his
dreams
.
*NL*
He
imagined
their
eyes
meeting
with
terrifying
recognition
;
imagined
*NL*
touching
her
lips
with
frightened
reverence
and
--
She
was
chirping
,
*NL*
``
Any
more
,
Mist
'
Babbitt
?
''
He
grunted
,
``
That
winds
it
up
,
I
guess
,
''
and
*NL*
turned
heavily
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
his
wandering
thoughts
,
they
had
never
been
more
intimate
than
*NL*
this
.
He
often
reflected
,
``
Nev
'
forget
how
old
Jake
Offutt
said
a
wise
*NL*
bird

goes
love-making
in
his

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
twenty-three
years
of
married
life
he
had
peered
uneasily
at
every
*NL*
graceful
ankle
,
every
soft
shoulder
;
in
thought
he
had
treasured
them
;
*NL*
but
not
once
had
he
hazarded
respectability
by
adventuring
.
Now
,
as
*NL*
he
calculated
the
cost
of
repapering
the
Styles
house
,
he
was
restless
*NL*
again
,
discontented
about
nothing
and
everything
,
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
discontentment
,
and
lonely
for
the
fairy
girl
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
morning
of
artistic
creation
.
Fifteen
minutes
after
the
purple
*NL*
prose
of
Babbitt
's
form-letter
,
Chester
Kirby
Laylock
,
the
resident
*NL*
salesman
at
Glen
Oriole
,
came
in
to
report
a
sale
and
submit
an
*NL*
advertisement
.
Babbitt
disapproved
of
Laylock
,
who
sang
in
choirs
and
*NL*
was
merry
at
home
over
games
of
Hearts
and
Old
Maid
.
He
had
a
tenor
*NL*
voice
,
wavy
chestnut
hair
,
and
a
mustache
like
a
camel
's
-
hair
brush
.
*NL*
Babbitt
considered
it
excusable
in
a
family-man
to
growl
,
``
Seen
this
*NL*
new
picture
of
the
kid
--
husky
little
devil
,
eh
?
''
but
Laylock
's
domestic
*NL*
confidences
were
as
bubbling
as
a
girl
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
I
think
I
got
a
peach
of
an
ad
for
the
Glen
,
Mr.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
Why
do
n't
we
try
something
in
poetry
?
Honest
,
it
'd
have
wonderful
*NL*
pulling-power
.
Listen
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Mid
pleasures
and
palaces
,
*NL*
Wherever
you
may
roam
,
*NL*
You
just
provide
the
little
bride
*NL*
And
we
'll
provide
the
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
get
it
?
See

Sweet
Home

'
Do
n't
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
hell
yes
,
of
course
I
get
it
.
But
--
Oh
,
I
think
we
'd
*NL*
better
use
something
more
dignified
and
forceful
,
like
`
We
lead
,
others
*NL*
follow
,
'
or
`
Eventually
,
why
not
now
?
'
Course
I
believe
in
using
*NL*
poetry
and
humor
and
all
that
junk
when
it
turns
the
trick
,
but
with
a
*NL*
high-class
restricted
development
like
the
Glen
we
better
stick
to
the
*NL*
more
dignified
approach
,
see
how
I
mean
?
Well
,
I
guess
that
's
all
,
this
*NL*
morning

*NL*
*NL*
By
a
tragedy
familiar
to
the
world
of
art
,
the
April
enthusiasm
of
Chet
*NL*
Laylock
served
only
to
stimulate
the
talent
of
the
older
craftsman
,
*NL*
George
F.
Babbitt
.
He
grumbled
to
Stanley
Graff
,
``
That
tan-colored
voice
*NL*
of
Chet
's
gets
on
my
nerves
,
''
yet
he
was
aroused
and
in
one
swoop
he
*NL*
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
DO
YOU
RESPECT
YOUR
LOVED
ONES
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
last
sad
rites

*NL*
*NL*
He
sent
Mat
Penniman
to
the
recorder
's
office
to
dig
out
the
names
*NL*
of
the
owners
of
houses
which
were
displaying
For
Rent
signs
of
other
*NL*
brokers
;
he
talked
to
a
man
who
desired
to
lease
a
store-building
for
*NL*
a
pool-room
;
he
ran
over
the
list
of
home-leases
which
were
about
to
*NL*
expire
;
he
sent
Thomas
Bywaters
,
a
street-car
conductor
who
played
at
*NL*
real
estate
in
spare
time
,
to
call
on
side-street
``
prospects
''
who
were
*NL*
unworthy
the
strategies
of
Stanley
Graff
.
But
he
had
spent
his
credulous
*NL*
excitement
of
creation
,
and
these
routine
details
annoyed
him
.
One
*NL*
moment
of
heroism
he
had
,
in
discovering
a
new
way
of
stopping
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
smoking
at
least
once
a
month
.
He
went
through
with
it
like
*NL*
the
solid
citizen
he
was
:
admitted
the
evils
of
tobacco
,
courageously
*NL*
made
resolves
,
laid
out
plans
to
check
the
vice
,
tapered
off
his
*NL*
allowance
of
cigars
,
and
expounded
the
pleasures
of
virtuousness
to
*NL*
every
one
he
met
.
He
did
everything
,
in
fact
,
except
stop
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
before
,
by
ruling
out
a
schedule
,
noting
down
the
hour
and
*NL*
minute
of
each
smoke
,
and
ecstatically
increasing
the
intervals
between
*NL*
smokes
,
he
had
brought
himself
down
to
three
cigars
a
day
.
Then
he
had
*NL*
lost
the
schedule
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
ago
he
had
invented
a
system
of
leaving
his
cigar-case
*NL*
and
cigarette-box
in
an
unused
drawer
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
correspondence-file
,
in
the
outer
office
.
``
I
'll
just
naturally
be
*NL*
ashamed
to
go
poking
in
there
all
day
long
,
making
a
fool
of
myself
*NL*
before
my
own
employees
!
''
he
reasoned
.
By
the
end
of
three
days
he
was
*NL*
trained
to
leave
his
desk
,
walk
to
the
file
,
take
out
and
light
a
cigar
,
*NL*
without
knowing
that
he
was
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
it
had
been
too
easy
to
open
*NL*
the
file
.
Lock
it
,
that
was
the
thing
!
Inspired
,
he
rushed
out
and
*NL*
locked
up
his
cigars
,
his
cigarettes
,
and
even
his
box
of
safety
*NL*
matches
;
and
the
key
to
the
file
drawer
he
hid
in
his
desk
.
But
the
*NL*
crusading
passion
of
it
made
him
so
tobacco-hungry
that
he
immediately
*NL*
recovered
the
key
,
walked
with
forbidding
dignity
to
the
file
,
took
out
*NL*
a
cigar
and
a
match
--
``
but
only
one
match
;
if
ole
cigar
goes
out
,
it
'll
*NL*
by
golly
have
to
stay
out
!
''
Later
,
when
the
cigar
did
go
out
,
he
took
*NL*
one
more
match
from
the
file
,
and
when
a
buyer
and
a
seller
came
in
for
*NL*
a
conference
at
eleven-thirty
,
naturally
he
had
to
offer
them
cigars
.
*NL*
His
conscience
protested
,
``
Why
,
you
're
smoking
with
them
!
''
but
he
*NL*
bullied
it
,
``
Oh
,
shut
up
!
I
'm
busy
now
.
Of
course
by-and-by
--
''
There
was
*NL*
no
by-and-by
,
yet
his
belief
that
he
had
crushed
the
unclean
habit
made
*NL*
him
feel
noble
and
very
happy
.
When
he
called
up
Paul
Riesling
he
was
,
*NL*
in
his
moral
splendor
,
unusually
eager
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fonder
of
Paul
Riesling
than
of
any
one
on
earth
except
himself
*NL*
and
his
daughter
Tinka
.
They
had
been
classmates
,
roommates
,
in
the
*NL*
State
University
,
but
always
he
thought
of
Paul
Riesling
,
with
his
dark
*NL*
slimness
,
his
precisely
parted
hair
,
his
nose-glasses
,
his
hesitant
*NL*
speech
,
his
moodiness
,
his
love
of
music
,
as
a
younger
brother
,
to
be
*NL*
petted
and
protected
.
Paul
had
gone
into
his
father
's
business
,
*NL*
after
graduation
;
he
was
now
a
wholesaler
and
small
manufacturer
of
*NL*
prepared-paper
roofing
.
But
Babbitt
strenuously
believed
and
lengthily
*NL*
announced
to
the
world
of
Good
Fellows
that
Paul
could
have
been
a
great
*NL*
violinist
or
painter
or
writer
.
``
Why
say
,
the
letters
that
boy
sent
me
*NL*
on
his
trip
to
the
Canadian
Rockies
,
they
just
absolutely
make
you
see
*NL*
the
place
as
if
you
were
standing
there

Believe
me
,
he
could
have
given
*NL*
any

bloomin

a
whale

a

on

said
only

IV
*NL*
*NL*
His
morning
was
not
sharply
marked
into
divisions
.
Interwoven
with
*NL*
correspondence
and
advertisement-writing
were
a
thousand
nervous
*NL*
details
:
calls
from
clerks
who
were
incessantly
and
hopefully
seeking
*NL*
five
furnished
rooms
and
bath
at
sixty
dollars
a
month
;
advice
to
Mat
*NL*
Penniman
on
getting
money
out
of
tenants
who
had
no
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
virtues
as
a
real-estate
broker
--
as
the
servant
of
society
in
*NL*
the
department
of
finding
homes
for
families
and
shops
for
distributors
*NL*
of
food
--
were
steadiness
and
diligence
.
He
was
conventionally
honest
,
he
*NL*
kept
his
records
of
buyers
and
sellers
complete
,
he
had
experience
with
*NL*
leases
and
titles
and
an
excellent
memory
for
prices
.
His
shoulders
were
*NL*
broad
enough
,
his
voice
deep
enough
,
his
relish
of
hearty
humor
strong
*NL*
enough
,
to
establish
him
as
one
of
the
ruling
caste
of
Good
Fellows
.
Yet
*NL*
his
eventual
importance
to
mankind
was
perhaps
lessened
by
his
large
and
*NL*
complacent
ignorance
of
all
architecture
save
the
types
of
houses
turned
*NL*
out
by
speculative
builders
;
all
landscape
gardening
save
the
use
of
*NL*
curving
roads
,
grass
,
and
six
ordinary
shrubs
;
and
all
the
commonest
*NL*
axioms
of
economics
.
He
serenely
believed
that
the
one
purpose
of
the
*NL*
real-estate
business
was
to
make
money
for
George
F.
Babbitt
.
True
,
*NL*
it
was
a
good
advertisement
at
Boosters
'
Club
lunches
,
and
all
the
*NL*
varieties
of
Annual
Banquets
to
which
Good
Fellows
were
invited
,
to
*NL*
speak
sonorously
of
Unselfish
Public
Service
,
the
Broker
's
Obligation
*NL*
to
Keep
Inviolate
the
Trust
of
His
Clients
,
and
a
thing
called
Ethics
,
*NL*
whose
nature
was
confusing
but
if
you
had
it
you
were
a
High-class
*NL*
Realtor
and
if
you
had
n't
you
were
a
shyster
,
a
piker
,
and
a
*NL*
fly-by-night
.
These
virtues
awakened
Confidence
,
and
enabled
you
to
*NL*
handle
Bigger
Propositions
.
But
they
did
n't
imply
that
you
were
to
be
*NL*
impractical
and
refuse
to
take
twice
the
value
of
a
house
if
a
buyer
was
*NL*
such
an
idiot
that
he
did
n't
jew
you
down
on
the
asking-price
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
spoke
well
--
and
often
--
at
these
orgies
of
commercial
*NL*
righteousness
about
the
``
realtor
's
function
as
a
seer
of
the
future
*NL*
development
of
the
community
,
and
as
a
prophetic
engineer
clearing
the
*NL*
pathway
for
inevitable
changes
''
--
which
meant
that
a
real-estate
broker
*NL*
could
make
money
by
guessing
which
way
the
town
would
grow
.
This
*NL*
guessing
he
called
Vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
address
at
the
Boosters
'
Club
he
had
admitted
,
``
It
is
at
once
the
*NL*
duty
and
the
privilege
of
the
realtor
to
know
everything
about
his
own
*NL*
city
and
its
environs
.
Where
a
surgeon
is
a
specialist
on
every
vein
and
*NL*
mysterious
cell
of
the
human
body
,
and
the
engineer
upon
electricity
in
*NL*
all
its
phases
,
or
every
bolt
of
some
great
bridge
majestically
arching
*NL*
o'er
a
mighty
flood
,
the
realtor
must
know
his
city
,
inch
by
inch
,
and
*NL*
all
its
faults
and
virtues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
did
know
the
market-price
,
inch
by
inch
,
of
certain
districts
*NL*
of
Zenith
,
he
did
not
know
whether
the
police
force
was
too
large
or
too
*NL*
small
,
or
whether
it
was
in
alliance
with
gambling
and
prostitution
.
*NL*
He
knew
the
means
of
fire-proofing
buildings
and
the
relation
of
*NL*
insurance-rates
to
fire-proofing
,
but
he
did
not
know
how
many
firemen
*NL*
there
were
in
the
city
,
how
they
were
trained
and
paid
,
or
how
complete
*NL*
their
apparatus
.
He
sang
eloquently
the
advantages
of
proximity
of
*NL*
school-buildings
to
rentable
homes
,
but
he
did
not
know
--
he
did
not
*NL*
know
that
it
was
worth
while
to
know
--
whether
the
city
schoolrooms
were
*NL*
properly
heated
,
lighted
,
ventilated
,
furnished
;
he
did
not
know
how
the
*NL*
teachers
were
chosen
;
and
though
he
chanted
``
One
of
the
boasts
of
Zenith
*NL*
is
that
we
pay
our
teachers
adequately
,
''
that
was
because
he
had
read
*NL*
the
statement
in
the
Advocate-Times
.
Himself
,
he
could
not
have
given
*NL*
the
average
salary
of
teachers
in
Zenith
or
anywhere
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
it
said
that
``
conditions
''
in
the
County
Jail
and
the
Zenith
*NL*
City
Prison
were
not
very
``
scientific
;
''
he
had
,
with
indignation
at
the
*NL*
criticism
of
Zenith
,
skimmed
through
a
report
in
which
the
notorious
*NL*
pessimist
Seneca
Doane
,
the
radical
lawyer
,
asserted
that
to
throw
*NL*
boys
and
young
girls
into
a
bull-pen
crammed
with
men
suffering
from
*NL*
syphilis
,
delirium
tremens
,
and
insanity
was
not
the
perfect
way
of
*NL*
educating
them
.
He
had
controverted
the
report
by
growling
,
``
Folks
that
*NL*
think
a
jail
ought
to
be
a
bloomin
'
Hotel
Thornleigh
make
me
sick
.
If
*NL*
people
do
n't
like
a
jail
,
let
'em
behave
'em
selves
and
keep
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Besides
,
these
reform
cranks
always
exaggerate
.
''
That
was
the
beginning
*NL*
and
quite
completely
the
end
of
his
investigations
into
Zenith
's
*NL*
charities
and
corrections
;
and
as
to
the
``
vice
districts
''
he
brightly
*NL*
expressed
it
,
``
Those
are
things
that
no
decent
man
monkeys
with
.
*NL*
Besides
,
smatter
fact
,
I
'll
tell
you
confidentially
:
it
's
a
protection
*NL*
to
our
daughters
and
to
decent
women
to
have
a
district
where
tough
nuts
*NL*
can
raise
cain
.
Keeps
'em
away
from
our
own
homes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
industrial
conditions
,
however
,
Babbitt
had
thought
a
great
deal
,
*NL*
and
his
opinions
may
be
coordinated
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
labor
union
is
of
value
because
it
keeps
out
radical
unions
,
*NL*
which
would
destroy
property
.
No
one
ought
to
be
forced
to
belong
to
a
*NL*
union
,
however
.
All
labor
agitators
who
try
to
force
men
to
join
a
union
*NL*
should
be
hanged
.
In
fact
,
just
between
ourselves
,
there
ought
n't
to
*NL*
be
any
unions
allowed
at
all
;
and
as
it
's
the
best
way
of
fighting
the
*NL*
unions
,
every
business
man
ought
to
belong
to
an
employers
'
-
association
*NL*
and
to
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
.
In
union
there
is
strength
.
So
any
*NL*
selfish
hog
who
does
n't
join
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
ought
to
be
forced
*NL*
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
nothing
--
as
the
expert
on
whose
advice
families
moved
to
new
*NL*
neighborhoods
to
live
there
for
a
generation
--
was
Babbitt
more
*NL*
splendidly
innocent
than
in
the
science
of
sanitation
.
He
did
not
know
*NL*
a
malaria-bearing
mosquito
from
a
bat
;
he
knew
nothing
about
tests
of
*NL*
drinking
water
;
and
in
the
matters
of
plumbing
and
sewage
he
was
as
*NL*
unlearned
as
he
was
voluble
.
He
often
referred
to
the
excellence
of
the
*NL*
bathrooms
in
the
houses
he
sold
.
He
was
fond
of
explaining
why
it
*NL*
was
that
no
European
ever
bathed
.
Some
one
had
told
him
,
when
he
was
*NL*
twenty-two
,
that
all
cesspools
were
unhealthy
,
and
he
still
denounced
*NL*
them
.
If
a
client
impertinently
wanted
him
to
sell
a
house
which
had
a
*NL*
cesspool
,
Babbitt
always
spoke
about
it
--
before
accepting
the
house
and
*NL*
selling
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
laid
out
the
Glen
Oriole
acreage
development
,
when
he
ironed
*NL*
woodland
and
dipping
meadow
into
a
glenless
,
orioleless
,
sunburnt
flat
*NL*
prickly
with
small
boards
displaying
the
names
of
imaginary
streets
,
he
*NL*
righteously
put
in
a
complete
sewage-system
.
It
made
him
feel
superior
;
*NL*
it
enabled
him
to
sneer
privily
at
the
Martin
Lumsen
development
,
*NL*
Avonlea
,
which
had
a
cesspool
;
and
it
provided
a
chorus
for
the
*NL*
full-page
advertisements
in
which
he
announced
the
beauty
,
convenience
,
*NL*
cheapness
,
and
supererogatory
healthfulness
of
Glen
Oriole
.
The
only
*NL*
flaw
was
that
the
Glen
Oriole
sewers
had
insufficient
outlet
,
so
that
*NL*
waste
remained
in
them
,
not
very
agreeably
,
while
the
Avonlea
cesspool
*NL*
was
a
Waring
septic
tank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
the
Glen
Oriole
project
was
a
suggestion
that
Babbitt
,
*NL*
though
he
really
did
hate
men
recognized
as
swindlers
,
was
not
too
*NL*
unreasonably
honest
.
Operators
and
buyers
prefer
that
brokers
should
*NL*
not
be
in
competition
with
them
as
operators
and
buyers
themselves
,
*NL*
but
attend
to
their
clients
'
interests
only
.
It
was
supposed
that
the
*NL*
Babbitt-Thompson
Company
were
merely
agents
for
Glen
Oriole
,
serving
*NL*
the
real
owner
,
Jake
Offutt
,
but
the
fact
was
that
Babbitt
and
Thompson
*NL*
owned
sixty-two
per
cent
.
of
the
Glen
,
the
president
and
purchasing
*NL*
agent
of
the
Zenith
Street
Traction
Company
owned
twenty-eight
per
*NL*
cent.
,
and
Jake
Offutt
-LRB-
a
gang-politician
,
a
small
manufacturer
,
*NL*
a
tobacco-chewing
old
farceur
who
enjoyed
dirty
politics
,
business
*NL*
diplomacy
,
and
cheating
at
poker
-RRB-
had
only
ten
per
cent.
,
which
*NL*
Babbitt
and
the
Traction
officials
had
given
to
him
for
``
fixing
''
health
*NL*
inspectors
and
fire
inspectors
and
a
member
of
the
State
Transportation
*NL*
Commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Babbitt
was
virtuous
.
He
advocated
,
though
he
did
not
practise
,
the
*NL*
prohibition
of
alcohol
;
he
praised
,
though
he
did
not
obey
,
the
laws
*NL*
against
motor-speeding
;
he
paid
his
debts
;
he
contributed
to
the
church
,
*NL*
the
Red
Cross
,
and
the
Y.
M.
C.
A.
;
he
followed
the
custom
of
his
*NL*
clan
and
cheated
only
as
it
was
sanctified
by
precedent
;
and
he
never
*NL*
descended
to
trickery
--
though
,
as
he
explained
to
Paul
Riesling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
every
ad
I
write
is
literally
true
or
*NL*
that
I
always
believe
everything
I
say
when
I
give
some
buyer
a
good
*NL*
strong
selling-spiel
.
You
see
--
you
see
it
's
like
this
:
In
the
first
*NL*
place
,
maybe
the
owner
of
the
property
exaggerated
when
he
put
it
into
*NL*
my
hands
,
and
it
certainly
is
n't
my
place
to
go
proving
my
principal
*NL*
a
liar
!
And
then
most
folks
are
so
darn
crooked
themselves
that
they
*NL*
expect
a
fellow
to
do
a
little
lying
,
so
if
I
was
fool
enough
to
never
*NL*
whoop
the
ante
I
'd
get
the
credit
for
lying
anyway
!
In
self-defense
I
*NL*
got
to
toot
my
own
horn
,
like
a
lawyer
defending
a
client
--
his
bounden
*NL*
duty
,
ai
n't
it
,
to
bring
out
the
poor
dub
's
good
points
?
Why
,
the
Judge
*NL*
himself
would
bawl
out
a
lawyer
that
did
n't
,
even
if
they
both
knew
*NL*
the
guy
was
guilty
!
But
even
so
,
I
do
n't
pad
out
the
truth
like
Cecil
*NL*
Rountree
or
Thayer
or
the
rest
of
these
realtors
.
Fact
,
I
think
a
fellow
*NL*
that
's
willing
to
deliberately
up
and
profit
by
lying
ought
to
be
shot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
value
to
his
clients
was
rarely
better
shown
than
this
*NL*
morning
,
in
the
conference
at
eleven-thirty
between
himself
,
Conrad
*NL*
Lyte
,
and
Archibald
Purdy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Conrad
Lyte
was
a
real-estate
speculator
.
He
was
a
nervous
speculator
.
*NL*
Before
he
gambled
he
consulted
bankers
,
lawyers
,
architects
,
contracting
*NL*
builders
,
and
all
of
their
clerks
and
stenographers
who
were
willing
*NL*
to
be
cornered
and
give
him
advice
.
He
was
a
bold
entrepreneur
,
and
he
*NL*
desired
nothing
more
than
complete
safety
in
his
investments
,
freedom
*NL*
from
attention
to
details
,
and
the
thirty
or
forty
per
cent
.
profit
*NL*
which
,
according
to
all
authorities
,
a
pioneer
deserves
for
his
risks
*NL*
and
foresight
.
He
was
a
stubby
man
with
a
cap-like
mass
of
short
gray
*NL*
curls
and
clothes
which
,
no
matter
how
well
cut
,
seemed
shaggy
.
Below
*NL*
his
eyes
were
semicircular
hollows
,
as
though
silver
dollars
had
been
*NL*
pressed
against
them
and
had
left
an
imprint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Particularly
and
always
Lyte
consulted
Babbitt
,
and
trusted
in
his
slow
*NL*
cautiousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
months
ago
Babbitt
had
learned
that
one
Archibald
Purdy
,
a
grocer
*NL*
in
the
indecisive
residential
district
known
as
Linton
,
was
talking
of
*NL*
opening
a
butcher
shop
beside
his
grocery
.
Looking
up
the
ownership
of
*NL*
adjoining
parcels
of
land
,
Babbitt
found
that
Purdy
owned
his
present
*NL*
shop
but
did
not
own
the
one
available
lot
adjoining
.
He
advised
Conrad
*NL*
Lyte
to
purchase
this
lot
,
for
eleven
thousand
dollars
,
though
an
*NL*
appraisal
on
a
basis
of
rents
did
not
indicate
its
value
as
above
nine
*NL*
thousand
.
The
rents
,
declared
Babbitt
,
were
too
low
;
and
by
waiting
they
*NL*
could
make
Purdy
come
to
their
price
.
-LRB-
This
was
Vision
.
-RRB-
He
had
to
bully
*NL*
Lyte
into
buying
.
His
first
act
as
agent
for
Lyte
was
to
increase
the
*NL*
rent
of
the
battered
store-building
on
the
lot
.
The
tenant
said
a
number
*NL*
of
rude
things
,
but
he
paid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Purdy
seemed
ready
to
buy
,
and
his
delay
was
going
to
cost
him
ten
*NL*
thousand
extra
dollars
--
the
reward
paid
by
the
community
to
Mr.
Conrad
*NL*
Lyte
for
the
virtue
of
employing
a
broker
who
had
Vision
and
*NL*
who
understood
Talking
Points
,
Strategic
Values
,
Key
Situations
,
*NL*
Underappraisals
,
and
the
Psychology
of
Salesmanship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lyte
came
to
the
conference
exultantly
.
He
was
fond
of
Babbitt
,
this
*NL*
morning
,
and
called
him
``
old
hoss
.
''
Purdy
,
the
grocer
,
a
long-nosed
man
*NL*
and
solemn
,
seemed
to
care
less
for
Babbitt
and
for
Vision
,
but
Babbitt
*NL*
met
him
at
the
street
door
of
the
office
and
guided
him
toward
the
*NL*
private
room
with
affectionate
little
cries
of
``
This
way
,
Brother
*NL*
Purdy
!
''
He
took
from
the
correspondence-file
the
entire
box
of
cigars
*NL*
and
forced
them
on
his
guests
.
He
pushed
their
chairs
two
inches
forward
*NL*
and
three
inches
back
,
which
gave
an
hospitable
note
,
then
leaned
*NL*
back
in
his
desk-chair
and
looked
plump
and
jolly
.
But
he
spoke
to
the
*NL*
weakling
grocer
with
firmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Brother
Purdy
,
we
been
having
some
pretty
tempting
offers
from
*NL*
butchers
and
a
slew
of
other
folks
for
that
lot
next
to
your
store
,
*NL*
but
I
persuaded
Brother
Lyte
that
we
ought
to
give
you
a
shot
at
the
*NL*
property
first
.
I
said
to
Lyte
,
`
It
'd
be
a
rotten
shame
,
'
I
said
,
`
if
*NL*
somebody
went
and
opened
a
combination
grocery
and
meat
market
right
*NL*
next
door
and
ruined
Purdy
's
nice
little
business
.
'
Especially
--
''
*NL*
Babbitt
leaned
forward
,
and
his
voice
was
harsh
,
''
--
it
would
be
hard
*NL*
luck
if
one
of
these
cash-and-carry
chain-stores
got
in
there
and
*NL*
started
cutting
prices
below
cost
till
they
got
rid
of
competition
and
*NL*
forced
you
to
the
wall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Purdy
snatched
his
thin
hands
from
his
pockets
,
pulled
up
his
trousers
,
*NL*
thrust
his
hands
back
into
his
pockets
,
tilted
in
the
heavy
oak
chair
,
*NL*
and
tried
to
look
amused
,
as
he
struggled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
're
bad
competition
.
But
I
guess
you
do
n't
realize
the
Pulling
*NL*
Power
that
Personality
has
in
a
neighborhood
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
Babbitt
smiled
.
``
That
's
so
.
Just
as
you
feel
,
old
man
.
We
*NL*
thought
we
'd
give
you
first
chance
.
All
right
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here
!
''
Purdy
wailed
.
``
I
know
f

r
a
fact

a
piece
of

property

size

sold
for
less

eighty-five

hundred

`
twa
'n'

two
years
ago

here
you

are
asking

twenty-four
thousand
dollars

Why

I
'd
have
to
mortgage
--
I
would
n't
mind
*NL*
so
much
paying
twelve
thousand
but
--
Why
good
God
,
Mr.
Babbitt
,
you
're
*NL*
asking
more
'n
twice
its
value

I
do

*NL*
take
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Purdy
,
I
do
n't
like
your
way
of
talking
!
I
do
n't
like
it
one
little
*NL*
bit
!
Supposing
Lyte
and
I
were
stinking
enough
to
want
to
ruin
any
*NL*
fellow
human
,
do
n't
you
suppose
we
know
it
's
to
our
own
selfish
interest
*NL*
to
have
everybody
in
Zenith
prosperous
?
But
all
this
is
beside
*NL*
the
point
.
Tell
you
what
we
'll
do
:
We
'll
come
down
to
twenty-three
*NL*
thousand-five
thousand
down
and
the
rest
on
mortgage
--
and
if
you
want
to
*NL*
wreck
the
old
shack
and
rebuild
,
I
guess
I
can
get
Lyte
here
to
loosen
*NL*
up
for
a

on
good
liberal

Heavens

we
'd

be
glad

it
is

reasonable
to

to
sacrifice
*NL*
eleven
thousand
or
more
just
for
neighborliness
,
IS
it
!
How
about
it
,
*NL*
Lyte
?
You
willing
to
come
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
warmly
taking
Purdy
's
part
,
Babbitt
persuaded
the
benevolent
Mr.
Lyte
*NL*
to
reduce
his
price
to
twenty-one
thousand
dollars
.
At
the
right
moment
*NL*
Babbitt
snatched
from
a
drawer
the
agreement
he
had
had
Miss
McGoun
type
*NL*
out
a
week
ago
and
thrust
it
into
Purdy
's
hands
.
He
genially
shook
his
*NL*
fountain
pen
to
make
certain
that
it
was
flowing
,
handed
it
to
Purdy
,
*NL*
and
approvingly
watched
him
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
work
of
the
world
was
being
done
.
Lyte
had
made
something
over
*NL*
nine
thousand
dollars
,
Babbitt
had
made
a
four-hundred-and-fifty
dollar
*NL*
commission
,
Purdy
had
,
by
the
sensitive
mechanism
of
modern
finance
,
*NL*
been
provided
with
a
business-building
,
and
soon
the
happy
inhabitants
*NL*
of
Linton
would
have
meat
lavished
upon
them
at
prices
only
a
little
*NL*
higher
than
those
down-town
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
a
manly
battle
,
but
after
it
Babbitt
drooped
.
This
was
the
*NL*
only
really
amusing
contest
he
had
been
planning
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
ahead
save
details
of
leases
,
appraisals
,
mortgages
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
muttered
,
``
Makes
me
sick
to
think
of
Lyte
carrying
off
most
of
the
*NL*
profit
when
I
did
all
the
work
,
the
old
skinflint
!
And
--
What
else
have
*NL*
I
got
to
do
to-day
?
...
Like
to
take
a
good
long
vacation
.
Motor
trip
.
*NL*
Something

He
sprang
up
,
rekindled
by
the
thought
of
lunching
with
Paul
*NL*
Riesling

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
BABBITT
'S
preparations
for
leaving
the
office
to
its
feeble
self
during
*NL*
the
hour
and
a
half
of
his
lunch-period
were
somewhat
less
elaborate
*NL*
than
the
plans
for
a
general
European
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fretted
to
Miss
McGoun
,
``
What
time
you
going
to
lunch
?
Well
,
make
*NL*
sure
Miss
Bannigan
is
in
then
.
Explain
to
her
that
if
Wiedenfeldt
calls
*NL*
up
,
she
's
to
tell
him
I
'm
already
having
the
title
traced
.
And
oh
,
*NL*
b
'
the
way
,
remind
me
to-morrow
to
have
Penniman
trace
it
.
Now
if
anybody
*NL*
comes
in
looking
for
a
cheap
house
,
remember
we
got
to
shove
that
Bangor
*NL*
Road

off
onto
somebody

If
you
need
me
,
I
'll
be
at

And

uh

And

uh

I
'll
be
back
by
two

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dusted
the
cigar-ashes
off
his
vest
.
He
placed
a
difficult
unanswered
*NL*
letter
on
the
pile
of
unfinished
work
,
that
he
might
not
fail
to
attend
*NL*
to
it
that
afternoon
.
-LRB-
For
three
noons
,
now
,
he
had
placed
the
same
*NL*
letter
on
the
unfinished
pile
.
-RRB-
He
scrawled
on
a
sheet
of
yellow
*NL*
backing-paper
the
memorandum
:
``
See
abt
apt
h
drs
,
''
which
gave
him
an
*NL*
agreeable
feeling
of
having
already
seen
about
the
apartment-house
*NL*
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discovered
that
he
was
smoking
another
cigar
.
He
threw
it
away
,
*NL*
protesting
,
``
Darn
it
,
I
thought
you
'd
quit
this
darn
smoking
!
''
He
*NL*
courageously
returned
the
cigar-box
to
the
correspondence-file
,
locked
*NL*
it
up
,
hid
the
key
in
a
more
difficult
place
,
and
raged
,
``
Ought
to
take
*NL*
care
of
myself
.
And
need
more
exercise
--
walk
to
the
club
,
every
single
*NL*
noon
--
just
what
I
'll
do
--
every
noon-cut
out
this
motoring
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
resolution
made
him
feel
exemplary
.
Immediately
after
it
he
decided
*NL*
that
this
noon
it
was
too
late
to
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
but
little
more
time
to
start
his
car
and
edge
it
into
the
*NL*
traffic
than
it
would
have
taken
to
walk
the
three
and
a
half
blocks
to
*NL*
the
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
drove
he
glanced
with
the
fondness
of
familiarity
at
the
*NL*
buildings
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stranger
suddenly
dropped
into
the
business-center
of
Zenith
could
not
*NL*
have
told
whether
he
was
in
a
city
of
Oregon
or
Georgia
,
Ohio
or
Maine
,
*NL*
Oklahoma
or
Manitoba
.
But
to
Babbitt
every
inch
was
individual
and
*NL*
stirring
.
As
always
he
noted
that
the
California
Building
across
the
way
*NL*
was
three
stories
lower
,
therefore
three
stories
less
beautiful
,
than
*NL*
his
own
Reeves
Building
.
As
always
when
he
passed
the
Parthenon
Shoe
*NL*
Shine
Parlor
,
a
one-story
hut
which
beside
the
granite
and
red-brick
*NL*
ponderousness
of
the
old
California
Building
resembled
a
bath-house
*NL*
under
a
cliff
,
he
commented
,
``
Gosh
,
ought
to
get
my
shoes
shined
this
*NL*
afternoon
.
Keep
forgetting
it
.
''
At
the
Simplex
Office
Furniture
Shop
,
*NL*
the
National
Cash
Register
Agency
,
he
yearned
for
a
dictaphone
,
for
a
*NL*
typewriter
which
would
add
and
multiply
,
as
a
poet
yearns
for
quartos
or
*NL*
a
physician
for
radium
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Nobby
Men
's
Wear
Shop
he
took
his
left
hand
off
the
*NL*
steering-wheel
to
touch
his
scarf
,
and
thought
well
of
himself
as
one
*NL*
who
bought
expensive
ties
``
and
could
pay
cash
for
'em
,
too
,
by
golly
;
''
*NL*
and
at
the
United
Cigar
Store
,
with
its
crimson
and
gold
alertness
,
he
*NL*
reflected
,
``
Wonder
if
I
need
some
cigars
--
idiot
--
plumb
forgot
--
going
*NL*
t
'
cut
down
my
fool
smoking
.
''
He
looked
at
his
bank
,
the
Miners
'
and
*NL*
Drovers
'
National
,
and
considered
how
clever
and
solid
he
was
to
bank
*NL*
with
so
marbled
an
establishment
.
His
high
moment
came
in
the
clash
*NL*
of
traffic
when
he
was
halted
at
the
corner
beneath
the
lofty
Second
*NL*
National
Tower
.
His
car
was
banked
with
four
others
in
a
line
of
steel
*NL*
restless
as
cavalry
,
while
the
cross
town
traffic
,
limousines
and
*NL*
enormous
moving-vans
and
insistent
motor-cycles
,
poured
by
;
on
the
*NL*
farther
corner
,
pneumatic
riveters
rang
on
the
sun-plated
skeleton
of
*NL*
a
new
building
;
and
out
of
this
tornado
flashed
the
inspiration
of
*NL*
a
familiar
face
,
and
a
fellow
Booster
shouted
,
``
H
'
are
you
,
George
!
''
*NL*
Babbitt
waved
in
neighborly
affection
,
and
slid
on
with
the
traffic
as
*NL*
the
policeman
lifted
his
hand
.
He
noted
how
quickly
his
car
picked
up
.
*NL*
He
felt
superior
and
powerful
,
like
a
shuttle
of
polished
steel
darting
*NL*
in
a
vast
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
always
he
ignored
the
next
two
blocks
,
decayed
blocks
not
yet
*NL*
reclaimed
from
the
grime
and
shabbiness
of
the
Zenith
of
1885
.
While
*NL*
he
was
passing
the
five-and-ten-cent
store
,
the
Dakota
Lodging
House
,
*NL*
Concordia
Hall
with
its
lodge-rooms
and
the
offices
of
fortune-tellers
*NL*
and
chiropractors
,
he
thought
of
how
much
money
he
made
,
and
he
boasted
*NL*
a
little
and
worried
a
little
and
did
old
familiar
sums
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
hundred
fifty
plunks
this
morning
from
the
Lyte
deal
.
But
taxes
*NL*
due
.
Let
's
see
:
I
ought
to
pull
out
eight
thousand

all
these

stenographers

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
his
scientific
budget-planning
was
that
he
felt
at
once
*NL*
triumphantly
wealthy
and
perilously
poor
,
and
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
these
dissertations
he
stopped
his
car
,
rushed
into
a
small
*NL*
news-and-miscellany
shop
,
and
bought
the
electric
cigar-lighter
which
*NL*
he
had
coveted
for
a
week
.
He
dodged
his
conscience
by
being
jerky
and
*NL*
noisy
,
and
by
shouting
at
the
clerk
,
``
Guess
this
will
prett
'
near
pay
*NL*
for
itself
in
matches
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pretty
thing
,
a
nickeled
cylinder
with
an
almost
silvery
*NL*
socket
,
to
be
attached
to
the
dashboard
of
his
car
.
It
was
not
only
,
as
*NL*
the
placard
on
the
counter
observed
,
``
a
dandy
little
refinement
,
*NL*
lending
the
last
touch
of
class
to
a
gentleman
's
auto
,
''
but
a
priceless
*NL*
time-saver
.
By
freeing
him
from
halting
the
car
to
light
a
match
,
it
*NL*
would
in
a
month
or
two
easily
save
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
drove
on
he
glanced
at
it
.
``
Pretty
nice
.
Always
wanted
one
,
''
he
*NL*
said
wistfully
.
``
The
one
thing
a
smoker
needs
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
remembered
that
he
had
given
up
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darn
it
!
''
he
mourned
.
``
Oh
well
,
I
suppose
I
'll
hit
a
cigar
once
in
a
*NL*
while

And

Be
a
great
convenience

Might
make

*NL*
the

*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
laden
with
treasure
,
after
three
and
a
half
blocks
of
romantic
*NL*
adventure
,
he
drove
up
to
the
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
Zenith
Athletic
Club
is
not
athletic
and
it
is
n't
exactly
a
club
,
*NL*
but
it
is
Zenith
in
perfection
.
It
has
an
active
and
smoke-misted
*NL*
billiard
room
,
it
is
represented
by
baseball
and
football
teams
,
and
in
*NL*
the
pool
and
the
gymnasium
a
tenth
of
the
members
sporadically
try
to
*NL*
reduce
.
But
most
of
its
three
thousand
members
use
it
as
a
cafe
in
which
*NL*
to
lunch
,
play
cards
,
tell
stories
,
meet
customers
,
and
entertain
out-of
*NL*
town
uncles
at
dinner
.
It
is
the
largest
club
in
the
city
,
and
its
chief
*NL*
hatred
is
the
conservative
Union
Club
,
which
all
sound
members
of
the
*NL*
Athletic
call
``
a
rotten
,
snobbish
,
dull
,
expensive
old
hole
--
not
one
*NL*
Good
Mixer
in
the
place
--
you
could
n't
hire
me
to
join
.
''
Statistics
show
*NL*
that
no
member
of
the
Athletic
has
ever
refused
election
to
the
Union
,
*NL*
and
of
those
who
are
elected
,
sixty-seven
per
cent
.
resign
from
the
*NL*
Athletic
and
are
thereafter
heard
to
say
,
in
the
drowsy
sanctity
of
the
*NL*
Union
lounge
,
``
The
Athletic
would
be
a
pretty
good
hotel
,
if
it
were
*NL*
more
exclusive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Athletic
Club
building
is
nine
stories
high
,
yellow
brick
with
*NL*
glassy
roof-garden
above
and
portico
of
huge
limestone
columns
below
.
*NL*
The
lobby
,
with
its
thick
pillars
of
porous
Caen
stone
,
its
pointed
*NL*
vaulting
,
and
a
brown
glazed-tile
floor
like
well-baked
bread-crust
,
is
*NL*
a
combination
of
cathedral-crypt
and
rathskellar
.
The
members
rush
into
*NL*
the
lobby
as
though
they
were
shopping
and
had
n't
much
time
for
it
.
Thus
*NL*
did
Babbitt
enter
,
and
to
the
group
standing
by
the
cigar-counter
he
*NL*
whooped
,
``
How
's
the
boys
?
How
's
the
boys
?
Well
,
well
,
fine
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jovially
they
whooped
back
--
Vergil
Gunch
,
the
coal-dealer
,
Sidney
*NL*
Finkelstein
,
the
ladies

-
ready-to-wear
buyer
for
Parcher

*NL*
Business
College
and
instructor
in
Public
Speaking
,
Business

,
*NL*
Scenario
Writing
,
and
Commercial

.
Though
Babbitt
admired
this
*NL*
savant
,
and
appreciated
Sidney
Finkelstein
as
``
a
mighty
smart
buyer
*NL*
and
a
good
liberal
spender
,
''
it
was
to
Vergil
Gunch
that
he
turned
with
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
Mr.
Gunch
was
president
of
the
Boosters
'
Club
,
a
weekly
*NL*
lunch-club
,
local
chapter
of
a
national
organization
which
promoted
*NL*
sound
business
and
friendliness
among
Regular
Fellows
.
He
was
also
no
*NL*
less
an
official
than
Esteemed
Leading
Knight
in
the
Benevolent
and
*NL*
Protective
Order
of
Elks
,
and
it
was
rumored
that
at
the
next
election
*NL*
he
would
be
a
candidate
for
Exalted
Ruler
.
He
was
a
jolly
man
,
given
to
*NL*
oratory
and
to
chumminess
with
the
arts
.
He
called
on
the
famous
*NL*
actors
and
vaudeville
artists
when
they
came
to
town
,
gave
them
cigars
,
*NL*
addressed
them
by
their
first
names
,
and
--
sometimes
--
succeeded
*NL*
in
bringing
them
to
the
Boosters
'
lunches
to
give
The
Boys
a
Free
*NL*
Entertainment
.
He
was
a
large
man
with
hair
en
brosse
,
and
he
knew
the
*NL*
latest
jokes
,
but
he
played
poker
close
to
the
chest
.
It
was
at
his
*NL*
party
that
Babbitt
had
sucked
in
the
virus
of
to-day

shouted

Oh

Babbitt

bellowed
.
-LRB-
He
was
three
feet
from

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``

Babbitt
turned
to
Finkelstein
,
the
*NL*
buyer
,
``
got
something
wanta
ask
you
about

I
went
out
and
bought
me
an

electric
cigar-lighter
for

,
this
noon
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
hunch
!
''
said
Finkelstein
,
while
even
the
learned
Professor
*NL*
Pumphrey
,
a
bulbous
man
with
a
pepper-and-salt
cutaway
and
a
pipe-organ
*NL*
voice
,
commented
,
``
That
makes
a
dandy
accessory

Cigar-lighter
gives

tone
to
the
dashboard

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep
,
finally
decided
I
'd
buy
me
one
.
Got
the
best
on
the
market
,
the
*NL*
clerk
said
it
was
.
Paid
five
bucks
for
it
.
Just
wondering
if
I
got
*NL*
stuck
.
What
do
they
charge
for
'em
at
the
store
,
Sid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finkelstein
asserted
that
five
dollars
was
not
too
great
a
sum
,
not
for
*NL*
a
really
high-class
lighter
which
was
suitably
nickeled
and
provided
*NL*
with
connections
of
the
very
best
quality
.
``
I
always
say
--
and
believe
*NL*
me
,
I
base
it
on
a
pretty
fairly
extensive
mercantile
experience
--
the
*NL*
best
is
the
cheapest
in
the
long
run
.
Of
course
if
a
fellow
wants
to
be
*NL*
a
Jew
about
it
,
he
can
get
cheap
junk
,
but
in
the
long
RUN
,
the
cheapest
*NL*
thing
is
--
the
best
you
can
get
!
Now
you
take
here
just
th
'
other
day
:
*NL*
I
got
a
new
top
for
my
old
boat
and
some
upholstery
,
and
I
paid
out
a
*NL*
hundred
and
twenty-six
fifty
,
and
of
course
a
lot
of
fellows
would
say
*NL*
that
was
too
much
--
Lord
,
if
the
Old
Folks
--
they
live
in
one
of
these
*NL*
hick
towns
up-state
and
they
simply
ca
n't
get
onto
the
way
a
city
*NL*
fellow
's
mind
works
,
and
then
,
of
course
,
they
're
Jews
,
and
they
'd
*NL*
lie
right
down
and
die
if
they
knew
Sid
had
anted
up
a
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty-six
bones
.
But
I
do
n't
figure
I
was
stuck
,
George
,
not
a
bit
.
*NL*
Machine
looks
brand
new
now
--
not
that
it
's
so
darned
old
,
of
course
;
had
*NL*
it
less
'n
three
years
,
but
I
give
it
hard
service
;
never
drive
less
*NL*
'n
a
hundred
miles
on
Sunday
and
,
uh
--
Oh
,
I
do
n't
really
think
you
*NL*
got
stuck
,
George
.
In
the
LONG
run
,
the
best
is
,
you
might
say
,
it
's
*NL*
unquestionably
the
cheapest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
Vergil
Gunch
.
``
That
's
the
way
I
look
at
it

If
a
*NL*
fellow
is
keyed
up
to
what
you

call
intensive
living
,
the
way
you
*NL*
get
it
here
in

all
the
hustle

mental
activity
that
's
going
*NL*
on
with
a
bunch
of
live-wires
like
the
Boosters

here
in
the
Z.A.C.
,
*NL*
why
,
he
's
got
to
save
his
nerves
by
having
the
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
nodded
his
head
at
every
fifth
word
in
the
roaring
rhythm
;
and
*NL*
by
the
conclusion
,
in
Gunch
's
renowned
humorous
vein
,
he
was
enchanted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
at
that
,
George
,
do
n't
know
's
you
can
afford
it
.
I
've
heard
your
*NL*
business
has
been
kind
of
under
the
eye
of
the
gov
`
ment
since
you
stole
*NL*
the
tail
of
Eathorne
Park
and
sold
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
're
a
great
little
josher

But
when
it
comes
to
kidding
,
*NL*
how
about
this
report
that
you
stole
the
black
marble
steps
off
the
*NL*
post-office
and
sold
'em
for
high-grade
coal
!
''
In
delight
Babbitt
patted
*NL*
Gunch
's
back
,
stroked
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
but
what
I
want
to
know
is
:
who
's
the
real-estate
*NL*
shark
that
bought
that
coal
for
his
apartment-houses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
that
'll
hold
you
for
a
while
,
George

''
said
Finkelstein
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
,
though

what
I
did
hear

George

missus
went
into
the
*NL*
gents

wear
department
at
Parcher

to
buy
him
some
collars
,
and
before
*NL*
she
could
give
his
neck-size
the
clerk
slips
her
some
thirteens
.
`
How
*NL*
juh
know
the
size
?
'
says
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
and
the
clerk
says
,
`
Men
that
*NL*
let
their
wives
buy
collars
for
'em
always
wear
thirteen

How

that

That
's
pretty
good

How

that

I

that

about
fix
*NL*
you

George

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
--
''
Babbitt
sought
for
amiable
insults
in
answer
.
He
stopped
,
*NL*
stared
at
the
door
.
Paul
Riesling
was
coming
in
.
Babbitt
cried
,
``
See
you
*NL*
later
,
boys
,
''
and
hastened
across
the
lobby
.
He
was
,
just
then
,
neither
*NL*
the
sulky
child
of
the
sleeping-porch
,
the
domestic
tyrant
of
the
*NL*
breakfast
table
,
the
crafty
money-changer
of
the
Lyte-Purdy
conference
,
*NL*
nor
the
blaring
Good
Fellow
,
the
Josher
and
Regular
Guy
,
of
the
Athletic
*NL*
Club
.
He
was
an
older
brother
to
Paul
Riesling
,
swift
to
defend
him
,
*NL*
admiring
him
with
a
proud
and
credulous
love
passing
the
love
of
women
.
*NL*
Paul
and
he
shook
hands
solemnly
;
they
smiled
as
shyly
as
though
they
*NL*
had
been
parted
three
years
,
not
three
days
--
and
they
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
old
horse-thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
guess
.
How
're
you
,
you
poor
shrimp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
first-rate
,
you
second-hand
hunk

''
*NL*
*NL*
Reassured
thus
of
their
high
fondness
,
Babbitt
grunted
,
``
You
're
a
fine
*NL*
guy
,
you
are
!
Ten
minutes
late
!
''
Riesling
snapped
,
``
Well
,
you
're
lucky
*NL*
to
have
a
chance
to
lunch
with
a
gentleman
!
''
They
grinned
and
went
into
*NL*
the
Neronian
washroom
,
where
a
line
of
men
bent
over
the
bowls
inset
*NL*
along
a
prodigious
slab
of
marble
as
in
religious
prostration
before
*NL*
their
own
images
in
the
massy
mirror
.
Voices
thick
,
satisfied
,
*NL*
authoritative
,
hurtled
along
the
marble
walls
,
bounded
from
the
ceiling
*NL*
of
lavender-bordered
milky
tiles
,
while
the
lords
of
the
city
,
the
*NL*
barons
of
insurance
and
law
and
fertilizers
and
motor
tires
,
laid
down
*NL*
the
law
for
Zenith
;
announced
that
the
day
was
warm-indeed
,
indisputably
*NL*
of
spring
;
that
wages
were
too
high
and
the
interest
on
mortgages
too
*NL*
low
;
that
Babe
Ruth
,
the
eminent
player
of
baseball
,
was
a
noble
man
;
*NL*
and
that
``
those
two
nuts
at
the
Climax
Vaudeville
Theater
this
week
*NL*
certainly
are
a
slick
pair
of
actors
.
''
Babbitt
,
though
ordinarily
his
*NL*
voice
was
the
surest
and
most
episcopal
of
all
,
was
silent
.
In
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
slight
dark
reticence
of
Paul
Riesling
,
he
was
awkward
,
*NL*
he
desired
to
be
quiet
and
firm
and
deft
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
lobby
of
the
Athletic
Club
was
Gothic
,
the
washroom
Roman
*NL*
Imperial
,
the
lounge
Spanish
Mission
,
and
the
reading-room
in
*NL*
Chinese
Chippendale
,
but
the
gem
of
the
club
was
the
dining-room
,
the
*NL*
masterpiece
of
Ferdinand
Reitman
,
Zenith
's
busiest
architect
.
It
was
*NL*
lofty
and
half-timbered
,
with
Tudor
leaded
casements
,
an
oriel
,
a
*NL*
somewhat
musicianless
musicians
'
-
gallery
,
and
tapestries
believed
*NL*
to
illustrate
the
granting
of
Magna
Charta
.
The
open
beams
had
*NL*
been
hand-adzed
at
Jake
Offutt
's
car-body
works
,
the
hinge
;
were
of
*NL*
hand-wrought
iron
,
the
wainscot
studded
with
handmade
wooden
pegs
,
and
*NL*
at
one
end
of
the
room
was
a
heraldic
and
hooded
stone
fireplace
which
*NL*
the
club
's
advertising-pamphlet
asserted
to
be
not
only
larger
than
any
*NL*
of
the
fireplaces
in
European
castles
but
of
a
draught
incomparably
more
*NL*
scientific
.
It
was
also
much
cleaner
,
as
no
fire
had
ever
been
built
in
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
of
the
tables
were
mammoth
slabs
which
seated
twenty
or
thirty
men
.
*NL*
Babbitt
usually
sat
at
the
one
near
the
door
,
with
a
group
including
*NL*
Gunch
,
Finkelstein
,
Professor
Pumphrey
,
Howard
Littlefield
,
his
*NL*
neighbor
,
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
,
the
poet
and
advertising-agent
,
and
*NL*
Orville
Jones
,
whose
laundry
was
in
many
ways
the
best
in
Zenith
.
They
*NL*
composed
a
club
within
the
club
,
and
merrily
called
themselves
``
The
*NL*
Roughnecks
.
''
To-day
as
he
passed
their
table
the
Roughnecks
greeted
him
,
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
sit
in
!
You
'n'
Paul
too
proud
to
feed
with
poor
folks
?
Afraid
*NL*
somebody
might
stick
you
for
a
bottle
of
Bevo
,
George
?
Strikes
me
you
*NL*
swells
are
getting
awful
darn
exclusive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thundered
,
``
You
bet
!
We
ca
n't
afford
to
have
our
reps
ruined
by
being
*NL*
seen
with
you
tightwads
!
''
and
guided
Paul
to
one
of
the
small
tables
*NL*
beneath
the
musicians
'
-
gallery
.
He
felt
guilty
.
At
the
Zenith
Athletic
*NL*
Club
,
privacy
was
very
bad
form
.
But
he
wanted
Paul
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
he
had
advocated
lighter
lunches
and
now
he
ordered
nothing
*NL*
but
English
mutton
chop
,
radishes
,
peas
,
deep-dish
apple
pie
,
a
bit
of
*NL*
cheese
,
and
a
pot
of
coffee
with
cream
,
adding
,
as
he
did
invariably
,
*NL*
``
And
uh
--
Oh
,
and
you
might
give
me
an
order
of
French
fried
potatoes
.
''
*NL*
When
the
chop
came
he
vigorously
peppered
it
and
salted
it
.
He
always
*NL*
peppered
and
salted
his
meat
,
and
vigorously
,
before
tasting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
he
took
up
the
spring-like
quality
of
the
spring
,
the
virtues
*NL*
of
the
electric
cigar-lighter
,
and
the
action
of
the
New
York
State
*NL*
Assembly
.
It
was
not
till
Babbitt
was
thick
and
disconsolate
with
mutton
*NL*
grease
that
he
flung
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wound
up
a
nice
little
deal
with
Conrad
Lyte
this
morning
that
put
*NL*
five
hundred
good
round
plunks
in
my
pocket
.
Pretty
nice
--
pretty
nice
!
*NL*
And
yet
--
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
with
me
to-day
.
Maybe
it
's
an
*NL*
attack
of
spring
fever
,
or
staying
up
too
late
at
Verg
Gunch
's
,
or
maybe
*NL*
it
's
just
the
winter
's
work
piling
up
,
but
I
've
felt
kind
of
down
in
the
*NL*
mouth
all
day
long
.
Course
I
would
n't
beef
about
it
to
the
fellows
at
*NL*
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
there
,
but
you
--
Ever
feel
that
way
,
Paul
?
Kind
*NL*
of
comes
over
me
:
here
I
've
pretty
much
done
all
the
things
I
ought
to
;
*NL*
supported
my
family
,
and
got
a
good
house
and
a
six-cylinder
car
,
and
*NL*
built
up
a
nice
little
business
,
and
I
have
n't
any
vices
`
specially
,
*NL*
except
smoking
--
and
I
'm
practically
cutting
that
out
,
by
the
way
.
And
I
*NL*
belong
to
the
church
,
and
play
enough
golf
to
keep
in
trim
,
and
I
only
*NL*
associate
with
good
decent
fellows
.
And
yet
,
even
so
,
I
do
n't
know
that
*NL*
I
'm
entirely
satisfied
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
drawled
out
,
broken
by
shouts
from
the
neighboring
tables
,
by
*NL*
mechanical
love-making
to
the
waitress
,
by
stertorous
grunts
as
the
*NL*
coffee
filled
him
with
dizziness
and
indigestion
.
He
was
apologetic
and
*NL*
doubtful
,
and
it
was
Paul
,
with
his
thin
voice
,
who
pierced
the
fog
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
,
George
,
you
do
n't
suppose
it
's
any
novelty

me
to
find

hustlers

that
think
we
're
so
all-fired
successful

are
n't
*NL*
getting
much
out
of
it

You
look
as

you
expected

report
you

Zilla
--
Oh

I
do

want
to
squeal

but
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
about

how
inspiring
a

is

Typical
instance
last
evening
:
We
went
*NL*
to
the
movies
.
There
was
a
big
crowd
waiting
in
the
lobby
,
us
at
the
*NL*
tail-end
.
She
began

Honestly

sometimes
when
I
look
at

see
how
she
's
*NL*
always
so
made
up

stinking
of

looking
for
trouble

through

me

good

she
's
almost
up

there
was
a

there

probably
been
waiting
half
an

I
kind

admired
the

he
turns
on

says

push
past

she
simply

she
*NL*
rips
out
at

drags
me
into

the

got

I
can
tell

every

were
packed
in

they
kept
making
remarks

Zilla
went
right
on
talking
about
the

*NL*
screeching
that

uneasy

was
bold

not
quite
sure
about
what
he
was

bold

Now
and
then
Babbitt
suddenly
agreed
with

in
an
admission
which
*NL*
contradicted
all
his
defense
of
duty
and
Christian
patience
,
and
at
each
*NL*
admission
he
had
a
curious
reckless
joy

``
Look

though
of

rooting

sure-enough

say
business

get
up

four

five
days

he
taken
a
holiday
without

neither

them
quite
believed

could
commit
this
audacity

Many

members
of

Athletic

did
go
camping
without
their
wives

but
*NL*
they
were
officially
dedicated
to
fishing
and
hunting

whereas
the
*NL*
sacred
and
unchangeable
sports
of
Babbitt
and
Paul
Riesling
were
*NL*
golfing
,
motoring
,
and
bridge
.
For
either
the
fishermen
or
the
golfers
*NL*
to
have
changed
their
habits
would
have
been
an
infraction
of
their
*NL*
self-imposed
discipline

would
have
shocked
all
right-thinking

*NL*
During
the
game
of
duck-pins
,
a
juvenile
form
of
bowling
,
Paul
was
*NL*
silent
.
As
they
came
down

steps
of

not
more
than
half
an

hour
after

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
forgot
Paul
Riesling
in
an
afternoon
of
not
unagreeable
details
.
*NL*
After
a
return
to
his
office
,
which
seemed
to
have
staggered
on
without
*NL*
him
,
he
drove
a
``
prospect
''
out
to
view
a
four-flat
tenement
in
the
*NL*
Linton
district
.
He
was
inspired
by
the
customer
's
admiration
of
the
new
*NL*
cigar-lighter
.
Thrice
its
novelty
made
him
use
it
,
and
thrice
he
hurled
*NL*
half-smoked
cigarettes
from
the
car
,
protesting
,
``
I
GOT
to
quit
smoking
*NL*
so
blame
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
ample
discussion
of
every
detail
of
the
cigar-lighter
led
them
*NL*
to
speak
of
electric
flat-irons
and
bed-warmers
.
Babbitt
apologized
for
*NL*
being
so
shabbily
old-fashioned
as
still
to
use
a
hot-water
bottle
,
and
*NL*
he
announced
that
he
would
have
the
sleeping-porch
wired
at
once
.
He
had
*NL*
enormous
and
poetic
admiration
,
though
very
little
understanding
,
of
all
*NL*
mechanical
devices
.
They
were
his
symbols
of
truth
and
beauty
.
Regarding
*NL*
each
new
intricate
mechanism
--
metal
lathe
,
two-jet
carburetor
,
machine
*NL*
gun
,
oxyacetylene
welder
--
he
learned
one
good
realistic-sounding
phrase
,
*NL*
and
used
it
over
and
over
,
with
a
delightful
feeling
of
being
technical
*NL*
and
initiated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
customer
joined
him
in
the
worship
of
machinery
,
and
they
came
*NL*
buoyantly
up
to
the
tenement
and
began
that
examination
of
plastic
slate
*NL*
roof
,
kalamein
doors
,
and
seven-eighths-inch
blind-nailed
flooring
,
*NL*
began
those
diplomacies
of
hurt
surprise
and
readiness
to
be
persuaded
*NL*
to
do
something
they
had
already
decided
to
do
,
which
would
some
day
*NL*
result
in
a
sale
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
back
Babbitt
picked
up
his
partner
and
father-in-law
,
Henry
*NL*
T.
Thompson
,
at
his
kitchen-cabinet
works
,
and
they
drove
through
South
*NL*
Zenith
,
a
high-colored
,
banging
,
exciting
region
:
new
factories
of
*NL*
hollow
tile
with
gigantic
wire-glass
windows
,
surly
old
red-brick
*NL*
factories
stained
with
tar
,
high-perched
water-tanks
,
big
red
trucks
*NL*
like
locomotives
,
and
,
on
a
score
of
hectic
side-tracks
,
far-wandering
*NL*
freight-cars
from
the
New
York
Central
and
apple
orchards
,
the
Great
*NL*
Northern
and
wheat-plateaus
,
the
Southern
Pacific
and
orange
groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
to
the
secretary
of
the
Zenith
Foundry
Company
about
*NL*
an
interesting
artistic
project
--
a
cast-iron
fence
for
Linden
Lane
*NL*
Cemetery
.
They
drove
on
to
the
Zeeco
Motor
Company
and
interviewed
*NL*
the
sales-manager
,
Noel
Ryland
,
about
a
discount
on
a
Zeeco
car
for
*NL*
Thompson
.
Babbitt
and
Ryland
were
fellow-members
of
the
Boosters
'
Club
,
*NL*
and
no
Booster
felt
right
if
he
bought
anything
from
another
Booster
*NL*
without
receiving
a
discount
.
But
Henry
Thompson
growled
,
``
Oh
,
t
'
hell
*NL*
with
'em
!
I
'm
not
going
to
crawl
around
mooching
discounts
,
not
*NL*
from
nobody
.
''
It
was
one
of
the
differences
between
Thompson
,
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
,
lean
Yankee
,
rugged
,
traditional
,
stage
type
of
*NL*
American
business
man
,
and
Babbitt
,
the
plump
,
smooth
,
efficient
,
*NL*
up-to-the-minute
and
otherwise
perfected
modern
.
Whenever
Thompson
*NL*
twanged
,
``
Put
your
John
Hancock
on
that
line
,
''
Babbitt
was
as
much
*NL*
amused
by
the
antiquated
provincialism
as
any
proper
Englishman
by
any
*NL*
American
.
He
knew
himself
to
be
of
a
breeding
altogether
more
esthetic
*NL*
and
sensitive
than
Thompson
's
.
He
was
a
college
graduate
,
he
played
*NL*
golf
,
he
often
smoked
cigarettes
instead
of
cigars
,
and
when
he
went
*NL*
to
Chicago
he
took
a
room
with
a
private
bath
.
``
The
whole
thing
is
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
to
Paul
Riesling
,
``
these
old
codgers
lack
the
subtlety
that
*NL*
you
got
to
have
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
advance
in
civilization
could
be
carried
too
far
,
Babbitt
*NL*
perceived
.
Noel
Ryland
,
sales-manager
of
the
Zeeco
,
was
a
frivolous
*NL*
graduate
of
Princeton
,
while
Babbitt
was
a
sound
and
standard
ware
from
*NL*
that
great
department-store
,
the
State
University
.
Ryland
wore
spats
,
*NL*
he
wrote
long
letters
about
City
Planning
and
Community
Singing
,
and
,
*NL*
though
he
was
a
Booster
,
he
was
known
to
carry
in
his
pocket
small
*NL*
volumes
of
poetry
in
a
foreign
language
.
All
this
was
going
too
far
.
*NL*
Henry
Thompson
was
the
extreme
of
insularity
,
and
Noel
Ryland
the
*NL*
extreme
of
frothiness
,
while
between
them
,
supporting
the
state
,
*NL*
defending
the
evangelical
churches
and
domestic
brightness
and
sound
*NL*
business
,
were
Babbitt
and
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
just
estimate
of
himself
--
and
with
the
promise
of
a
discount
*NL*
on
Thompson
's
car
--
he
returned
to
his
office
in
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
he
went
through
the
corridor
of
the
Reeves
Building
he
sighed
,
*NL*
``
Poor
old
Paul
!
I
got
to
--
Oh
,
damn
Noel
Ryland
!
Damn
Charley
McKelvey
!
*NL*
Just
because
they
make
more
money
than
I
do
,
they
think
they
're
so
*NL*
superior
.
I
would
n't
be
found
dead
in
their
stuffy
old
Union
Club
!
*NL*
I
--
Somehow
,
to-day
,
I
do
n't
feel
like
going
back
to
work
.
Oh
well

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
telephone
calls
,
he
read
the
four
o'clock
mail
,
he
signed
*NL*
his
morning
's
letters
,
he
talked
to
a
tenant
about
repairs
,
he
fought
*NL*
with
Stanley
Graff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Graff
,
the
outside
salesman
,
was
always
hinting
that
he
deserved
*NL*
an
increase
of
commission
,
and
to-day
he
complained
,
``
I
think
I
ought
*NL*
to
get
a
bonus
if
I
put
through
the
Heiler
sale
.
I
'm
chasing
around
and
*NL*
working
on
it
every
single
evening
,
almost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
frequently
remarked
to
his
wife
that
it
was
better
to
``
con
your
*NL*
office-help
along
and
keep
'em
happy
`
stead
of
jumping
on
'em
and
poking
*NL*
'em
up
--
get
more
work
out
of
'em
that
way
,
''
but
this
unexampled
lack
of
*NL*
appreciation
hurt
him
,
and
he
turned
on
Graff
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Stan
;
let
's
get
this
clear
.
You
've
got
an
idea
somehow
that
*NL*
it
's
you
that
do
all
the
selling
.
Where
d'
you
get
that
stuff
?
Where
*NL*
d'
you
think
you
'd
be
if
it
was
n't
for
our
capital
behind
you
,
and
our
*NL*
lists
of
properties
,
and
all
the
prospects
we
find
for
you
?
All
you
got
*NL*
to
do
is
follow
up
our
tips
and
close
the
deal
.
The
hall-porter
could
*NL*
sell
Babbitt-Thompson
listings
!
You
say
you
're
engaged
to
a
girl
,
but
*NL*
have
to
put
in
your
evenings
chasing
after
buyers
.
Well
,
why
the
devil
*NL*
should
n't
you
?
What
do
you
want
to
do
?
Sit
around
holding
her
hand
?
Let
*NL*
me
tell
you
,
Stan
,
if
your
girl
is
worth
her
salt
,
she
'll
be
glad
to
*NL*
know
you
're
out
hustling
,
making
some
money
to
furnish
the
home-nest
,
*NL*
instead
of
doing
the
lovey-dovey
.
The
kind
of
fellow
that
kicks
about
*NL*
working
overtime
,
that
wants
to
spend
his
evenings
reading
trashy
novels
*NL*
or
spooning
and
exchanging
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
foolishness
with
some
*NL*
girl
,
he
ai
n't
the
kind
of
upstanding
,
energetic
young
man
,
with
a
*NL*
future
--
and
with
Vision
!
--
that
we
want
here
.
How
about
it
?
What
's
your
*NL*
Ideal
,
anyway
?
Do
you
want
to
make
money
and
be
a
responsible
member
*NL*
of
the
community
,
or
do
you
want
to
be
a
loafer
,
with
no
Inspiration
or
*NL*
Pep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Graff
was
not
so
amenable
to
Vision
and
Ideals
as
usual
.
``
You
bet
I
*NL*
want
to
make
money
!
That
's
why
I
want
that
bonus
!
Honest
,
Mr.
Babbitt
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
to
get
fresh
,
but
this
Heiler
house
is
a
terror
.
Nobody
'll
*NL*
fall
for
it
.
The
flooring
is
rotten
and
the
walls
are
full
of
cracks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
what
I
mean
!
To
a
salesman
with
a
love
for
his
*NL*
profession
,
it
's
hard
problems
like
that
that
inspire
him
to
do
his
*NL*
best
.
Besides
,
Stan
--
Matter
o
'
fact
,
Thompson
and
I
are
against
bonuses
,
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
principle
.
We
like
you
,
and
we
want
to
help
you
so
you
*NL*
can
get
married
,
but
we
ca
n't
be
unfair
to
the
others
on
the
staff
.
*NL*
If
we
start
giving
you
bonuses
,
do
n't
you
see
we
're
going
to
hurt
*NL*
the
feeling
and
be
unjust
to
Penniman
and
Laylock

Right
's
right

and
*NL*
discrimination
is
unfair
,
and
there
ai
n't
going
to
be
any
of
it
in
this
*NL*
office

Do
n't
get
the
idea
,
Stan
,
that
because
during
the
war
salesmen
*NL*
were
hard
to
hire
,
now
,
when
there
's
a
lot
of
men
out
of
work
,
there
*NL*
are
n't
a
slew
of
bright
young
fellows
that
would
be
glad
to
step
in
*NL*
and
enjoy
your
opportunities
,
and
not
act
as
if
Thompson
and
I
were
his
*NL*
enemies
and
not
do
any
work
except
for
bonuses
.
How
about
it
,
heh
?
How
*NL*
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
well
--
gee
--
of
course
--
''
sighed
Graff
,
as
he
went
out
,
crabwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
did
not
often
squabble
with
his
employees
.
He
liked
to
like
the
*NL*
people
about
him
;
he
was
dismayed
when
they
did
not
like
him
.
It
was
*NL*
only
when
they
attacked
the
sacred
purse
that
he
was
frightened
into
*NL*
fury
,
but
then
,
being
a
man
given
to
oratory
and
high
principles
,
*NL*
he
enjoyed
the
sound
of
his
own
vocabulary
and
the
warmth
of
his
own
*NL*
virtue
.
Today
he
had
so
passionately
indulged
in
self-approval
that
he
*NL*
wondered
whether
he
had
been
entirely
just
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
Stan
is
n't
a
boy
any
more

Ought

call
him
so
hard

But
*NL*
rats
,
got
to
haul
folks
over
the
coals
now
and
then
for
their
own
good
.
*NL*
Unpleasant
duty
,
but
--
I
wonder
if
Stan
is
sore
?
What
's
he
saying
to
*NL*
McGoun
out
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
chill
a
wind
of
hatred
blew
from
the
outer
office
that
the
normal
*NL*
comfort
of
his
evening
home-going
was
ruined
.
He
was
distressed
by
*NL*
losing
that
approval
of
his
employees
to
which
an
executive
is
always
*NL*
slave
.
Ordinarily
he
left
the
office
with
a
thousand
enjoyable
fussy
*NL*
directions
to
the
effect
that
there
would
undoubtedly
be
important
tasks
*NL*
to-morrow
,
and
Miss
McGoun
and
Miss
Bannigan
would
do
well
to
be
there
*NL*
early
,
and
for
heaven
's
sake
remind
him
to
call
up
Conrad
Lyte
soon
's
*NL*
he
came
in
.
To-night
he
departed
with
feigned
and
apologetic
liveliness
.
*NL*
He
was
as
afraid
of
his
still-faced
clerks
--
of
the
eyes
focused
on
him
,
*NL*
Miss
McGoun
staring
with
head
lifted
from
her
typing
,
Miss
Bannigan
*NL*
looking
over
her
ledger
,
Mat
Penniman
craning
around
at
his
desk
in
the
*NL*
dark
alcove
,
Stanley
Graff
sullenly
expressionless
--
as
a
parvenu
before
*NL*
the
bleak
propriety
of
his
butler
.
He
hated
to
expose
his
back
to
their
*NL*
laughter
,
and
in
his
effort
to
be
casually
merry
he
stammered
and
was
*NL*
raucously
friendly
and
oozed
wretchedly
out
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
forgot
his
misery
when
he
saw
from
Smith
Street
the
charms
of
*NL*
Floral
Heights
;
the
roofs
of
red
tile
and
green
slate
,
the
shining
new
*NL*
sun-parlors
,
and
the
stainless
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
to
inform
Howard
Littlefield
,
his
scholarly
neighbor
,
that
*NL*
though
the
day
had
been
springlike
the
evening
might
be
cold
.
He
went
in
*NL*
to
shout
``
Where
are
you
?
''
at
his
wife
,
with
no
very
definite
desire
to
*NL*
know
where
she
was
.
He
examined
the
lawn
to
see
whether
the
furnace-man
*NL*
had
raked
it
properly
.
With
some
satisfaction
and
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
discussion
of
the
matter
with
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
Ted
,
and
Howard
Littlefield
,
*NL*
he
concluded
that
the
furnace-man
had
not
raked
it
properly
.
He
cut
two
*NL*
tufts
of
wild
grass
with
his
wife
's
largest
dressmaking-scissors
;
he
*NL*
informed
Ted
that
it
was
all
nonsense
having
a
furnace-man
--
``
big
*NL*
husky
fellow
like
you
ought
to
do
all
the
work
around
the
house
;
''
and
*NL*
privately
he
meditated
that
it
was
agreeable
to
have
it
known
throughout
*NL*
the
neighborhood
that
he
was
so
prosperous
that
his
son
never
worked
*NL*
around
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
on
the
sleeping-porch
and
did
his
day
's
exercises
:
arms
out
*NL*
sidewise
for
two
minutes
,
up
for
two
minutes
,
while
he
muttered
,
``
Ought
*NL*
take
more
exercise
;
keep
in
shape
;
''
then
went
in
to
see
whether
his
*NL*
collar
needed
changing
before
dinner
.
As
usual
it
apparently
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lettish-Croat
maid
,
a
powerful
woman
,
beat
the
dinner-gong
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
roast
of
beef
,
roasted
potatoes
,
and
string
beans
were
excellent
*NL*
this
evening
and
,
after
an
adequate
sketch
of
the
day
's
progressive
*NL*
weather-states
,
his
four-hundred-and-fifty-dollar
fee
,
his
lunch
with
*NL*
Paul
Riesling
,
and
the
proven
merits
of
the
new
cigar-lighter
,
he
was
*NL*
moved
to
a
benign
,
``
Sort
o
'
thinking
about
buyin
,
a
new
car

Do
n't
*NL*
believe
we
'll
get
one
till
next
year
,
but
still
we
might

*NL*
Verona
,
the
older
daughter
,
cried
,
``
Oh
,
Dad
,
if
you
do
,
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
get
a
sedan
?
That
would
be
perfectly
slick
!
A
closed

is
so
much
more

comfy
than
an
open
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
I
do
n't
know
about
that

I
kind
of
like
an

get
*NL*
more
fresh

that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

shoot

that
's
just
because

It

more

said
Ted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
closed

does
keep
the

nicer

from
Mrs.
Babbitt
;
``
You
*NL*
do

get

blown
all
to

from

;
``
It

sportier

from
Ted
;
and
from
Tinka
,
the
youngest
,
``
Oh

let
's
have
a
*NL*
sedan

Mary
Ellen
's

Ted
wound
up
,
``
Oh
,
everybody
's
*NL*
got
a
closed
car
now
,
except
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
faced
them
:
``
I
guess
you
got
nothing
very
terrible
to
complain
*NL*
about
!
Anyway
,
I
do
n't
keep
a
car
just
to
enable
you
children
to
look
*NL*
like
millionaires
!
And
I
like
an
open
car
,
so
you
can
put
the
top
down
*NL*
on
summer
evenings
and
go
out
for
a
drive
and
get
some
good
fresh
air
.
*NL*
Besides
--
A
closed
car
costs
more
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
gee
whiz
,
if
the
Doppelbraus
can
afford
a
closed
car
,
I
guess
we
*NL*
can
!
''
prodded
Ted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
I
make
eight
thousand
a
year
to
his
seven
!
But
I
do
n't
blow
it
*NL*
all
in
and
waste
it
and
throw
it
around
,
the
way
he
does
!
Do
n't
believe
*NL*
in
this
business
of
going
and
spending
a
whole
lot
of
money
to
show
off
*NL*
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
,
with
ardor
and
some
thoroughness
,
into
the
matters
of
*NL*
streamline
bodies
,
hill-climbing
power
,
wire
wheels
,
chrome
steel
,
*NL*
ignition
systems
,
and
body
colors
.
It
was
much
more
than
a
study
of
*NL*
transportation
.
It
was
an
aspiration
for
knightly
rank
.
In
the
city
of
*NL*
Zenith
,
in
the
barbarous
twentieth
century
,
a
family
's
motor
indicated
*NL*
its
social
rank
as
precisely
as
the
grades
of
the
peerage
determined
*NL*
the
rank
of
an
English
family
--
indeed
,
more
precisely
,
considering
the
*NL*
opinion
of
old
county
families
upon
newly
created
brewery
barons
and
*NL*
woolen-mill
viscounts
.
The
details
of
precedence
were
never
officially
*NL*
determined
.
There
was
no
court
to
decide
whether
the
second
son
of
a
*NL*
Pierce
Arrow
limousine
should
go
in
to
dinner
before
the
first
son
of
a
*NL*
Buick
roadster
,
but
of
their
respective
social
importance
there
was
no
*NL*
doubt
;
and
where
Babbitt
as
a
boy
had
aspired
to
the
presidency
,
his
*NL*
son
Ted
aspired
to
a
Packard
twin-six
and
an
established
position
in
the
*NL*
motored
gentry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
favor
which
Babbitt
had
won
from
his
family
by
speaking
of
a
new
car
*NL*
evaporated
as
they
realized
that
he
did
n't
intend
to
buy
one
this
year
.
*NL*
Ted
lamented
,
``
Oh
,
punk
!
The
old
boat
looks
as
if
it
'd
had
fleas
and
*NL*
been
scratching
its
varnish
off
.
''
Mrs.
Babbitt
said
abstractedly
,
*NL*
``
Snoway
talkcher
father
.
''
Babbitt
raged
,
``
If
you
're
too
much
of
a
*NL*
high-class
gentleman
,
and
you
belong
to
the
bon
ton
and
so
on
,
why
,
you
*NL*
need
n't
take
the
car
out
this
evening
.
''
Ted
explained
,
``
I
did
n't
mean
--
''
*NL*
and
dinner
dragged
on
with
normal
domestic
delight
to
the
inevitable
*NL*
point
at
which
Babbitt
protested
,
``
Come
,
come
now
,
we
ca
n't
sit
here
all
*NL*
evening
.
Give
the
girl
a
chance
to
clear
away
the
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fretting
,
``
What
a
family
!
I
do
n't
know
how
we
all
get
to
*NL*
scrapping
this
way
.
Like
to
go
off
some
place
and
be
able
to
hear
myself
*NL*
think
...
Paul
...
Maine
...
Wear
old
pants
,
and
loaf
,
and
cuss
.
''
He
*NL*
said
cautiously
to
his
wife
,
``
I
've
been
in
correspondence
with
a
man
in
*NL*
New
York
--
wants
me
to
see
him
about
a
real-estate
trade
--
may
not
come
*NL*
off
till
summer
.
Hope
it
does
n't
break
just
when
we
and
the
Rieslings
*NL*
get
ready
to
go
to
Maine
.
Be
a
shame
if
we
could
n't
make
the
trip
there
*NL*
together
.
Well
,
no
use
worrying
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Verona
escaped
,
immediately
after
dinner
,
with
no
discussion
save
an
*NL*
automatic
``
Why
do
n't
you
ever
stay
home
?
''
from
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
living-room
,
in
a
corner
of
the
davenport
,
Ted
settled
down
to
*NL*
his
Home
Study
;
plain
geometry
,
Cicero
,
and
the
agonizing
metaphors
of
*NL*
Comus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
they
give
us
this
old-fashioned
junk
by
Milton
and
*NL*
Shakespeare
and
Wordsworth
and
all
these
has-beens
,
''
he
protested
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
I
guess
I
could
stand
it
to
see
a
show
by
Shakespeare
,
if
they
had
swell
*NL*
scenery
and
put
on
a
lot
of
dog
,
but
to
sit
down
in
cold
blood
and
READ
*NL*
'em
--
These
teachers
--
how
do
they
get
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
darning
socks
,
speculated
,
``
Yes
,
I
wonder
why
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
professors
and
everybody
,
but
I
do
*NL*
think
there
's
things
in
Shakespeare
--
not
that
I
read
him
much
,
but
when
*NL*
I
was
young
the
girls
used
to
show
me
passages
that
were
n't
,
really
,
*NL*
they
were
n't
at
all
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
looked
up
irritably
from
the
comic
strips
in
the
Evening
*NL*
Advocate
.
They
composed
his
favorite
literature
and
art
,
these
*NL*
illustrated
chronicles
in
which
Mr.
Mutt
hit
Mr.
Jeff
with
a
rotten
egg
,
*NL*
and
Mother
corrected
Father
's
vulgarisms
by
means
of
a
rolling-pin
.
With
*NL*
the
solemn
face
of
a
devotee
,
breathing
heavily
through
his
open
*NL*
mouth
,
he
plodded
nightly
through
every
picture
,
and
during
the
rite
*NL*
he
detested
interruptions
.
Furthermore
,
he
felt
that
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
Shakespeare
he
was
n't
really
an
authority
.
Neither
the
Advocate-Times
,
*NL*
the
Evening
Advocate
,
nor
the
Bulletin
of
the
Zenith
Chamber
of
Commerce
*NL*
had
ever
had
an
editorial
on
the
matter
,
and
until
one
of
them
had
*NL*
spoken
he
found
it
hard
to
form
an
original
opinion
.
But
even
at
risk
*NL*
of
floundering
in
strange
bogs
,
he
could
not
keep
out
of
an
open
*NL*
controversy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
why
you
have
to
study
Shakespeare
and
those
.
It
's
because
*NL*
they
're
required
for
college
entrance
,
and
that
's
all
there
is
to
it
!
*NL*
Personally
,
I
do
n't
see
myself
why
they
stuck
'em
into
an
up-to-date
*NL*
high-school
system
like
we
have
in
this
state
.
Be
a
good
deal
better
if
*NL*
you
took
Business
English
,
and
learned
how
to
write
an
ad
,
or
letters
*NL*
that
would
pull
.
But
there
it
is
,
and
there
's
no
tall
,
argument
,
or
*NL*
discussion
about
it
!
Trouble
with
you
,
Ted
,
is
you
always
want
to
do
*NL*
something
different
!
If
you
're
going
to
law-school
--
and
you
are
!
--
I
*NL*
never
had
a
chance
to
,
but
I
'll
see
that
you
do
--
why
,
you
'll
want
to
lay
*NL*
in
all
the
English
and
Latin
you
can
get
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
punk

I
do
n't
see
what
's
the
use
of
law-school

or
even
finishing
*NL*
high
school

I
do
n't
want
to
go
to
college

Honest
,
there
's
*NL*
lot
of
fellows
that
have
graduated
from
colleges
that
do

make
as
much
money
as
fellows
that
went
to
work
early

Peters

that
teaches
Latin

he
's
a
what-is-it

Columbia
*NL*
and
he
sits
up
all
night
reading
a
lot
of
greasy
books
and
he
's
always
*NL*
spieling
about
the
`
value
of
languages
,
'
and
the
poor
soak
does
n't
make
*NL*
but
eighteen
hundred
a
year

and
no
traveling
salesman
would
think
of
*NL*
working
for
that

I
know
what
I
'd
like
to
do
.
I
'd
like
to
be
an
aviator
,
*NL*
or
own
a
corking
big
garage
,
or
else
--
a
fellow
was
telling
me
about
it
*NL*
yesterday

I
'd
like
to
be
one
of
these
fellows
that
the
Standard
Oil
*NL*
Company
sends
out
to
China
,
and
you
live
in
a
compound
and
do
n't
have
to
*NL*
do
any
work
,
and
you
get
to
see
the
world
and
pagodas
and
the
ocean
and
*NL*
everything
!
And
then
I
could
take
up
correspondence-courses
.
That
's
*NL*
the
real
stuff
!
You
do

have
to
recite
to
some
frosty-faced
old

dame
that
's
trying
to
show
off
to
the
principal

and
you
can
study
any
*NL*
subject
you
want
to

Just

to
these

Mouse-Man
we
used
to
laughingly
call
the
dear
*NL*
fellow
.
One
time
he
was
so
timid
he
was
plumb
scared
of
the
Super
,
and
*NL*
never
got
credit
for
the
dandy
work
he
did
.
Him
at
the
De
Luxe
!
And
if
*NL*
he
was
n't
ordering
a
tony
feed
with
all
the
``
fixings
''
from
celery
to
*NL*
nuts
!
And
instead
of
being
embarrassed
by
the
waiters
,
like
he
used
to
*NL*
be
at
the
little
dump
where
we
lunched
in
Old
Lang
Syne
,
he
was
bossing
*NL*
them
around
like
he
was
a
millionaire
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
cautiously
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
.
Freddy
laughed
and
said
,
``
Say
,
*NL*
old
chum
,
I
guess
you
're
wondering
what
's
come
over
me
.
You
'll
be
glad
*NL*
to
know
I
'm
now
Assistant
Super
at
the
old
shop
,
and
right
on
the
High
*NL*
Road
to
Prosperity
and
Domination
,
and
I
look
forward
with
confidence
*NL*
to
a
twelve-cylinder
car
,
and
the
wife
is
making
things
hum
in
the
best
*NL*
society
and
the
kiddies
getting
a
first-class

*NL*
``
Here
's
how
it
happened
.
I
ran
across
an
ad
of
a
course
that
claimed
*NL*
to
teach
people
how
to
talk
easily
and
on
their
feet
,
how
to
answer
*NL*
complaints
,
how
to
lay
a
proposition
before
the
Boss
,
how
to
hit
a
*NL*
bank
for
a
loan
,
how
to
hold
a
big
audience
spellbound
with
wit
,
humor
,
*NL*
anecdote
,
inspiration
,
etc.
.
It
was
compiled
by
the
Master
Orator
,
Prof.
*NL*
Waldo
F.
Peet
.
I
was
skeptical
,
too
,
but
I
wrote
-LRB-
JUST
ON
A
POSTCARD
,
*NL*
with
name
and
address
-RRB-
to
the
publisher
for
the
lessons
--
sent
On
Trial
,
*NL*
money
back
if
you
are
not
absolutely
satisfied
.
There
were
eight
simple
*NL*
lessons
in
plain
language
anybody
could
understand
,
and
I
studied
them
*NL*
just
a
few
hours
a
night
,
then
started
practising
on
the
wife
.
Soon
*NL*
found
I
could
talk
right
up
to
the
Super
and
get
due
credit
for
all
the
*NL*
good
work
I
did
.
They
began
to
appreciate
me
and
advance
me
fast
,
and
*NL*
say
,
old
doggo
,
what
do
you
think
they
're
paying
me
now
?
$
6,500
per
*NL*
year
!
And
say
,
I
find
I
can
keep
a
big
audience
fascinated
,
speaking
on
*NL*
any
topic
.
As
a
friend
,
old
boy
,
I
advise
you
to
send

*NL*
Babbitt
was
again
without
a
canon
which
would
enable
him
to
speak
with
*NL*
authority
.
Nothing
in
motoring
or
real
estate
had
indicated
what
a
Solid
*NL*
Citizen
and
Regular
Fellow
ought
to
think
about
culture
by
mail
.
He
*NL*
began
with
hesitation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
sounds
as
if
it
covered
the
ground
.
It
certainly
is
a
fine
thing
*NL*
to
be
able
to
orate
.
I
've
sometimes
thought
I
had
a
little
talent
that
*NL*
way
myself
,
and
I
know
darn
well
that
one
reason
why
a
fourflushing
old
*NL*
back-number
like
Chan
Mott
can
get
away
with
it
in
real
estate
is
just
*NL*
because
he
can
make
a
good
talk
,
even
when
he
has
n't
got
a
doggone
thing
*NL*
to
say
!
And
it
certainly
is
pretty
cute
the
way
they
get
out
all
these
*NL*
courses
on
various
topics
and
subjects
nowadays
.
I
'll
tell
you
,
though
:
*NL*
No
need
to
blow
in
a
lot
of
good
money
on
this
stuff
when
you
can
get
*NL*
a
first-rate
course
in
eloquence
and
English
and
all
that
right
in
*NL*
your
own
school
--
and
one
of
the
biggest
school
buildings
in
the
entire
*NL*
country
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Babbitt
comfortably
,
while
Ted
complained
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yuh
,
but
Dad
,
they
just
teach
a
lot
of
old
junk
that
is
n't
any
*NL*
practical
use
--
except
the
manual
training
and
typewriting
and
basketball
*NL*
and
dancing
--
and
in
these
correspondence-courses
,
gee
,
you
can
get
all
*NL*
kinds
of
stuff
that
would
come
in
handy
.
Say
,
listen
to
this
one
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
CAN
YOU
PLAY
A
MAN
'S
PART
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
are
walking
with
your
mother
,
sister
or
best
girl
and
some
*NL*
one
passes
a
slighting
remark
or
uses
improper
language
,
wo
n't
you
be
*NL*
ashamed
if
you
ca
n't
take
her
part
?
Well
,
can
you
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
teach
boxing
and
self-defense
by
mail
.
Many
pupils
have
written
*NL*
saying
that
after
a
few
lessons
they
've
outboxed
bigger
and
heavier
*NL*
opponents
.
The
lessons
start
with
simple
movements
practised
before
your
*NL*
mirror
--
holding
out
your
hand
for
a
coin
,
the
breast-stroke
in
swimming
,
*NL*
etc.
.
Before
you
realize
it
you
are
striking
scientifically
,
ducking
,
*NL*
guarding
and
feinting
,
just
as
if
you
had
a
real
opponent
before
you
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Ted
chanted
.
``

'll
tell
the

'd
like
to
take
one
fellow

always

shooting
off

catch
him
alone

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

The
idea

Most
useless

ever
heard

Babbitt
*NL*
fulminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

I
was
walking

passed

used
improper

What
would

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Ted

Mrs.
Babbitt
said
placidly
,
``
it
's
not

talking

fighting
this

*NL*
*NL*
``

's

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody

Babbitt
*NL*
observed
,
``
not

stay
home

hanging
around

they
never

always

about

get
followed

insulted

all

I
do
n't
*NL*
believe

it

Babbitt
was
impressed
,
and
he
had
a
delightful
*NL*
parental
feeling
that
they

the
men
of

understood

Babbitt
sought
for
adequate

of
his
admiration

*NL*
``
I
'm

Yes

might
interest

must

ask

*NL*
``

Ted
had
the
immense
and
joyful
maturity
of
a
*NL*
boy
who
is
respectfully
listened
to
by
his

Babbitt
concentrated
*NL*
on
him
with
grateful
affection
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
see
what
an
influence
these

I

never
admit
it
publicly

fellow
like
*NL*
myself
,
a
State

,
it
's
only
decent
and
patriotic
for
him
to
*NL*
blow
his
horn

boost
the
Alma

but
smatter
of
fact
,
there
's
*NL*
a
whole
lot
of
valuable
time
lost
even
at
the
U.

studying
poetry
and
*NL*
French
and
subjects
that
never
brought
in
anybody
a
cent
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
but
what
maybe
these
correspondence-courses
might
prove
to
be
one
of
the
*NL*
most
important
American
inventions

*NL*
*NL*
``
Trouble
with
a
lot
of
folks
is
:
they
're
so
blame
material

they
do
n't
*NL*
see
the
spiritual

mental
side
of
American
supremacy
;
they
think
that
*NL*
inventions
like
the
telephone
and
the
areoplane

wireless
--
no
,
*NL*
that
was
a
Wop
invention
,

anyway
:
they
think
these
mechanical
*NL*
improvements
are
all
that
we
stand
for
;

to
a
real

he
*NL*
sees

dominating

*NL*
Rotarianism

and
Prohibition

Democracy

what
compose

maybe
this

may
*NL*
be
another

may
be
another

The
philosophers
gasped
.
It
was
Mrs.
Babbitt
who
had
made
this
discord
*NL*
in
their
spiritual
harmony
,
and
one
of
Mrs.
Babbitt

virtues
was
that

*NL*
except
during
dinner-parties

when
she
was
transformed
into
a
raging
*NL*
hostess

she
took
care
of
the
house
and
did
n't
bother
the
males
by

She
went
on
firmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
awful
to
me

something

nobody

I
always

*NL*
Babbitt
attended
to
her
:

Nonsense

just
as

he
blows
in

sits
around

out
of

*NL*
Ted
was
leaning
back

smoking
a
cigarette
without
reproof

He
was
,
for

the
moment

sharing
the
high
thin
air
of
Babbitt

speculation
as
though

he
were
Paul

He
hinted
:

it

known

*NL*
When
Babbitt
had
graduated
from
the
State
University
,
twenty-four
years
*NL*
ago
,
he
had
intended
to
be
a
lawyer
.
He
had
been
a
ponderous
debater
in
*NL*
college
;
he
felt
that
he
was
an
orator
;
he
saw
himself
becoming
governor
*NL*
of
the
state
.
While
he
read
law
he
worked
as
a
real-estate
salesman
.
He
*NL*
saved
money
,
lived
in
a
boarding-house
,
supped
on
poached
egg
on
hash

The
lively
Paul
Riesling
-LRB-
who
was
certainly
going
off
to
Europe
to
study
*NL*
violin
,
next
month
or
next
year
-RRB-
was
his
refuge
till
Paul
was
bespelled
*NL*
by
Zilla
Colbeck
,
who
laughed
and
danced
and
drew
men
after
her
plump
*NL*
and
gaily
wagging
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
evenings
were
barren
then
,
and
he
found
comfort
only
in
Paul
's
*NL*
second
cousin
,
Myra
Thompson
,
a
sleek
and
gentle
girl
who
showed
her
*NL*
capacity
by
agreeing
with
the
ardent
young
Babbitt
that
of
course
he
was
*NL*
going
to
be
governor
some
day
.
Where
Zilla
mocked
him
as
a
country
boy
,
*NL*
Myra
said
indignantly
that
he
was
ever
so
much
solider
than
the
young
*NL*
dandies

had
been
born
in
the
great
city
of

an
ancient

settlement
in

hundred
and
five
years
old
,
with
two
hundred
*NL*
thousand
population
,
the
queen
and
wonder
of
all
the
state
and
,
to
the
*NL*
Catawba
boy
,
George
Babbitt
,
so
vast
and
thunderous
and
luxurious
that
*NL*
he
was
flattered
to
know
a
girl
ennobled
by
birth
in
Zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
love
there
was
no
talk
between
them
.
He
knew
that
if
he
was
to
*NL*
study
law
he
could
not
marry
for
years
;
and
Myra
was
distinctly
a
Nice
*NL*
Girl
--
one
did
n't
kiss
her
,
one
did
n't
``
think
about
her
that
way
at
all
''
*NL*
unless
one
was
going
to
marry
her
.
But
she
was
a
dependable
companion
.
*NL*
She
was
always
ready
to
go
skating
,
walking
;
always
content
to
hear
his
*NL*
discourses
on
the
great
things
he
was
going
to
do
,
the
distressed
poor
*NL*
whom
he
would
defend
against
the
Unjust
Rich
,
the
speeches
he
would
*NL*
make
at
Banquets
,
the
inexactitudes
of
popular
thought
which
he
would
*NL*
correct
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
he
was
weary
and
soft-minded
,
he
saw
that
she
had
been
*NL*
weeping
.
She
had
been
left
out
of
a
party
given
by
Zilla
.
Somehow
her
*NL*
head
was
on
his
shoulder
and
he
was
kissing
away
the
tears
--
and
she
*NL*
raised
her
head
to
say
trustingly
,
``
Now
that
we
're
engaged
,
shall
we
be
*NL*
married
soon
or
shall
we
wait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Engaged
?
It
was
his
first
hint
of
it
.
His
affection
for
this
brown
*NL*
tender
woman
thing
went
cold
and
fearful
,
but
he
could
not
hurt
her
,
*NL*
could
not
abuse
her
trust
.
He
mumbled
something
about
waiting
,
and
*NL*
escaped
.
He
walked
for
an
hour
,
trying
to
find
a
way
of
telling
her
that
*NL*
it
was
a
mistake
.
Often
,
in
the
month
after
,
he
got
near
to
telling
her
,
*NL*
but
it
was
pleasant
to
have
a
girl
in
his
arms
,
and
less
and
less
could
*NL*
he
insult
her
by
blurting
that
he
did
n't
love
her
.
He
himself
had
no
*NL*
doubt
.
The
evening
before
his
marriage
was
an
agony
,
and
the
morning
*NL*
wild
with
the
desire
to
flee
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
him
what
is
known
as
a
Good
Wife
.
She
was
loyal
,
industrious
,
*NL*
and
at
rare
times
merry
.
She
passed
from
a
feeble
disgust
at
their
*NL*
closer
relations
into
what
promised
to
be
ardent
affection
,
but
it
*NL*
drooped
into
bored
routine
.
Yet
she
existed
only
for
him
and
for
the
*NL*
children
,
and
she
was
as
sorry
,
as
worried
as
himself
,
when
he
gave
up
*NL*
the
law
and
trudged
on
in
a
rut
of
listing
real
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
kid
,
she
has
n't
had
much
better
time
than
I
have
,
''
Babbitt
*NL*
reflected
,
standing
in
the
dark
sun-parlor
.
``
But
--
I
wish
I
could
've
had
*NL*
a
whirl
at
law
and
politics
.
Seen
what
I
could
do
.
Well
--
Maybe
I
've
made
*NL*
more
money
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
living-room
but
before
he
settled
down
he
smoothed
*NL*
his
wife
's
hair
,
and
she
glanced
up
,
happy
and
somewhat
surprised
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
solemnly
finished
the
last
copy
of
the
American
Magazine
,
while
his
*NL*
wife
sighed
,
laid
away
her
darning
,
and
looked
enviously
at
the
lingerie
*NL*
designs
in
a
women
's
magazine
.
The
room
was
very
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
room
which
observed
the
best
Floral
Heights
standards
.
The
gray
*NL*
walls
were
divided
into
artificial
paneling
by
strips
of
white-enameled
*NL*
pine
.
From
the
Babbitts
'
former
house
had
come
two
much-carved
*NL*
rocking-chairs
,
but
the
other
chairs
were
new
,
very
deep
and
restful
,
*NL*
upholstered
in
blue
and
gold-striped
velvet
.
A
blue
velvet
davenport
*NL*
faced
the
fireplace
,
and
behind
it
was
a
cherrywood
table
and
a
tall
*NL*
piano-lamp
with
a
shade
of
golden
silk
.
-LRB-
Two
out
of
every
three
houses
*NL*
in
Floral
Heights
had
before
the
fireplace
a
davenport
,
a
mahogany
table
*NL*
real
or
imitation
,
and
a
piano-lamp
or
a
reading-lamp
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
yellow
or
rose
silk
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
was
a
runner
of
gold-threaded
Chinese
fabric
,
four
*NL*
magazines
,
a
silver
box
containing
cigarette-crumbs
,
and
three
*NL*
``
gift-books
''
--
large
,
expensive
editions
of
fairy-tales
illustrated
by
*NL*
English
artists
and
as
yet
unread
by
any
Babbitt
save
Tinka
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
corner
by
the
front
windows
was
a
large
cabinet
Victrola
.
-LRB-
Eight
*NL*
out
of
every
nine
Floral
Heights
houses
had
a
cabinet
phonograph
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
pictures
,
hung
in
the
exact
center
of
each
gray
panel
,
were
*NL*
a
red
and
black
imitation
English
hunting-print
,
an
anemic
imitation
*NL*
boudoir-print
with
a
French
caption
of
whose
morality
Babbitt
had
always
*NL*
been
rather
suspicious
,
and
a
``
hand-colored
''
photograph
of
a
Colonial
*NL*
room
--
rag
rug
,
maiden
spinning
,
cat
demure
before
a
white
fireplace
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Nineteen
out
of
every
twenty
houses
in
Floral
Heights
had
either
a
*NL*
hunting-print
,
a
Madame
Feit
la
Toilette
print
,
a
colored
photograph
of
*NL*
a
New
England
house
,
a
photograph
of
a
Rocky
Mountain
,
or
all
four
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
room
as
superior
in
comfort
to
the
``
parlor
''
of
Babbitt
's
*NL*
boyhood
as
his
motor
was
superior
to
his
father
's
buggy
.
Though
there
*NL*
was
nothing
in
the
room
that
was
interesting
,
there
was
nothing
that
*NL*
was
offensive
.
It
was
as
neat
,
and
as
negative
,
as
a
block
of
artificial
*NL*
ice
.
The
fireplace
was
unsoftened
by
downy
ashes
or
by
sooty
brick
;
the
*NL*
brass
fire-irons
were
of
immaculate
polish
;
and
the
grenadier
andirons
*NL*
were
like
samples
in
a
shop
,
desolate
,
unwanted
,
lifeless
things
of
*NL*
commerce
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
the
wall
was
a
piano
,
with
another
piano-lamp
,
but
no
one
used
*NL*
it
save
Tinka
.
The
hard
briskness
of
the
phonograph
contented
them
;
*NL*
their
store
of
jazz
records
made
them
feel
wealthy
and
cultured
;
and
all
*NL*
they
knew
of
creating
music
was
the
nice
adjustment
of
a
bamboo
needle
.
*NL*
The
books
on
the
table
were
unspotted
and
laid
in
rigid
parallels
;
*NL*
not
one
corner
of
the
carpet-rug
was
curled
;
and
nowhere
was
there
*NL*
a
hockey-stick
,
a
torn
picture-book
,
an
old
cap
,
or
a
gregarious
and
*NL*
disorganizing
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
Babbitt
never
read
with
absorption
.
He
was
concentrated
enough
*NL*
at
the
office
but
here
he
crossed
his
legs
and
fidgeted
.
When
his
story
*NL*
was
interesting
he
read
the
best
,
that
is
the
funniest
,
paragraphs
to
*NL*
his
wife
;
when
it
did
not
hold
him
he
coughed
,
scratched
his
ankles
and
*NL*
his
right
ear
,
thrust
his
left
thumb
into
his
vest
pocket
,
jingled
his
*NL*
silver
,
whirled
the
cigar-cutter
and
the
keys
on
one
end
of
his
watch
*NL*
chain
,
yawned
,
rubbed
his
nose
,
and
found
errands
to
do
.
He
went
*NL*
upstairs
to
put
on
his
slippers
--
his
elegant
slippers
of
seal-brown
,
*NL*
shaped
like
medieval
shoes
.
He
brought
up
an
apple
from
the
barrel
which
*NL*
stood
by
the
trunk-closet
in
the
basement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
apple
a
day
keeps
the
doctor
away
,
''
he
enlightened
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
for
*NL*
quite
the
first
time
in
fourteen
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
apple
is
Nature
's
best
regulator
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trouble
with
women
is
,
they
never
have
sense
enough
to
form
regular
*NL*
habits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
nibbling
and
eating
between
meals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
''
She
looked
up
from
her
reading
.
``
Did
you
have
a
light
lunch
*NL*
to-day
,
like
you
were
going
to
?
I
did
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
malicious
and
unprovoked
attack
astounded
him
.
``
Well
,
maybe
it
*NL*
was
n't
as
light
as
--
Went
to
lunch
with
Paul
and
did
n't
have
much
chance
*NL*
to
diet
.
Oh
,
you
need
n't
to
grin
like
a
chessy
cat
!
If
it
was
n't
for
me
*NL*
watching
out
and
keeping
an
eye
on
our
diet
--
I
'm
the
only
member
of
this
*NL*
family
that
appreciates
the
value
of
oatmeal
for
breakfast
.
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stooped
over
her
story
while
he
piously
sliced
and
gulped
down
the
*NL*
apple
,
discoursing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
I
've
done
:
cut
down
my
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
kind
of
a
run-in
with
Graff
in
the
office
.
He
's
getting
too
darn
*NL*
fresh
.
I
'll
stand
for
a
good
deal
,
but
once
in
a
while
I
got
to
assert
*NL*
my
authority
,
and
I
jumped
him
.
`
Stan
,
'
I
said
--
Well
,
I
told
him
just
*NL*
exactly
where
he
got
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Funny
kind
of
a
day
.
Makes
you
feel
restless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wellllllllll
,
uh
--
''
That
sleepiest
sound
in
the
world
,
the
terminal
*NL*
yawn
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
yawned
with
it
,
and
looked
grateful
as
he
droned
,
*NL*
``
How
about
going
to
bed
,
eh
?
Do
n't
suppose
Rone
and
Ted
will
be
in
till
*NL*
all
hours
.
Yep
,
funny
kind
of
a
day
;
not
terribly
warm
but
yet
--
Gosh
,
*NL*
I
'd
like
--
Some
day
I
'm
going
to
take
a
long
motor
trip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
'd
enjoy
that
,
''
she
yawned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
from
her
as
he
realized
that
he
did
not
wish
to
have
*NL*
her
go
with
him
.
As
he
locked
doors
and
tried
windows
and
set
the
heat
*NL*
regulator
so
that
the
furnace-drafts
would
open
automatically
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
he
sighed
a
little
,
heavy
with
a
lonely
feeling
which
perplexed
*NL*
and
frightened
him
.
So
absent-minded
was
he
that
he
could
not
remember
*NL*
which
window-catches
he
had
inspected
,
and
through
the
darkness
,
*NL*
fumbling
at
unseen
perilous
chairs
,
he
crept
back
to
try
them
all
over
*NL*
again
.
His
feet
were
loud
on
the
steps
as
he
clumped
upstairs
at
the
end
*NL*
of
this
great
and
treacherous
day
of
veiled
rebellions
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
Before
breakfast
he
always
reverted
to
up-state
village
boyhood
,
and
*NL*
shrank
from
the
complex
urban
demands
of
shaving
,
bathing
,
deciding
*NL*
whether
the
current
shirt
was
clean
enough
for
another
day
.
Whenever
he
*NL*
stayed
home
in
the
evening
he
went
to
bed
early
,
and
thriftily
got
*NL*
ahead
in
those
dismal
duties
.
It
was
his
luxurious
custom
to
shave
while
*NL*
sitting
snugly
in
a
tubful
of
hot
water
.
He
may
be
viewed
to-night
as
a
*NL*
plump
,
smooth
,
pink
,
baldish
,
podgy
goodman
,
robbed
of
the
importance
of
*NL*
spectacles
,
squatting
in
breast-high
water
,
scraping
his
lather-smeared
*NL*
cheeks
with
a
safety-razor
like
a
tiny
lawn-mower
,
and
with
melancholy
*NL*
dignity
clawing
through
the
water
to
recover
a
slippery
and
active
piece
*NL*
of
soap
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lulled
to
dreaming
by
the
caressing
warmth
.
The
light
fell
on
the
*NL*
inner
surface
of
the
tub
in
a
pattern
of
delicate
wrinkled
lines
which
*NL*
slipped
with
a
green
sparkle
over
the
curving
porcelain
as
the
clear
*NL*
water
trembled
.
Babbitt
lazily
watched
it
;
noted
that
along
the
*NL*
silhouette
of
his
legs
against
the
radiance
on
the
bottom
of
the
tub
,
*NL*
the
shadows
of
the
air-bubbles
clinging
to
the
hairs
were
reproduced
*NL*
as
strange
jungle
mosses
.
He
patted
the
water
,
and
the
reflected
light
*NL*
capsized
and
leaped
and
volleyed
.
He
was
content
and
childish
.
He
*NL*
played
.
He
shaved
a
swath
down
the
calf
of
one
plump
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drain-pipe
was
dripping
,
a
dulcet
and
lively
song
:
drippety
drip
*NL*
drip
dribble
,
drippety
drip
drip
drip
.
He
was
enchanted
by
it
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
the
solid
tub
,
the
beautiful
nickel
taps
,
the
tiled
walls
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
felt
virtuous
in
the
possession
of
this
splendor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
roused
himself
and
spoke
gruffly
to
his
bath-things
.
``
Come
here
!
*NL*
You
've
done
enough
fooling
!
''
he
reproved
the
treacherous
soap
,
and
*NL*
defied
the
scratchy
nail-brush
with
``
Oh
,
you
would
,
would
you
!
''
He
*NL*
soaped
himself
,
and
rinsed
himself
,
and
austerely
rubbed
himself
;
he
*NL*
noted
a
hole
in
the
Turkish
towel
,
and
meditatively
thrust
a
finger
*NL*
through
it
,
and
marched
back
to
the
bedroom
,
a
grave
and
unbending
*NL*
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
gorgeous
abandon
,
a
flash
of
melodrama
such
as
he
*NL*
found
in
traffic-driving
,
when
he
laid
out
a
clean
collar
,
discovered
*NL*
that
it
was
frayed
in
front
,
and
tore
it
up
with
a
magnificent
yeeeeeing
*NL*
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
important
of
all
was
the
preparation
of
his
bed
and
the
*NL*
sleeping-porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
known
whether
he
enjoyed
his
sleeping-porch
because
of
the
*NL*
fresh
air
or
because
it
was
the
standard
thing
to
have
a
sleeping-porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
was
an
Elk
,
a
Booster
,
and
a
member
of
the
Chamber
of
*NL*
Commerce
,
just
as
the
priests
of
the
Presbyterian
Church
determined
his
*NL*
every
religious
belief
and
the
senators
who
controlled
the
Republican
*NL*
Party
decided
in
little
smoky
rooms
in
Washington
what
he
should
think
*NL*
about
disarmament
,
tariff
,
and
Germany
,
so
did
the
large
national
*NL*
advertisers
fix
the
surface
of
his
life
,
fix
what
he
believed
to
be
*NL*
his
individuality
.
These
standard
advertised
wares
--
toothpastes
,
socks
,
*NL*
tires
,
cameras
,
instantaneous
hot-water
heaters
--
were
his
symbols
and
*NL*
proofs
of
excellence
;
at
first
the
signs
,
then
the
substitutes
,
for
joy
*NL*
and
passion
and
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
none
of
these
advertised
tokens
of
financial
and
social
success
was
*NL*
more
significant
than
a
sleeping-porch
with
a
sun-parlor
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rites
of
preparing
for
bed
were
elaborate
and
unchanging
.
The
*NL*
blankets
had
to
be
tucked
in
at
the
foot
of
his
cot
.
-LRB-
Also
,
the
reason
*NL*
why
the
maid
had
n't
tucked
in
the
blankets
had
to
be
discussed
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Babbitt
.
-RRB-
The
rag
rug
was
adjusted
so
that
his
bare
feet
would
strike
it
*NL*
when
he
arose
in
the
morning
.
The
alarm
clock
was
wound
.
The
hot-water
*NL*
bottle
was
filled
and
placed
precisely
two
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
cot
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
tremendous
undertakings
yielded
to
his
determination
;
one
by
*NL*
one
they
were
announced
to
Mrs.
Babbitt
and
smashed
through
to
*NL*
accomplishment
.
At
last
his
brow
cleared
,
and
in
his
``
Gnight
!
''
rang
*NL*
virile
power
.
But
there
was
yet
need
of
courage
.
As
he
sank
into
sleep
,
*NL*
just
at
the
first
exquisite
relaxation
,
the
Doppelbrau
car
came
home
.
*NL*
He
bounced
into
wakefulness
,
lamenting
,
``
Why
the
devil
ca
n't
some
people
*NL*
never
get
to
bed
at
a
reasonable
hour
?
''
So
familiar
was
he
with
the
*NL*
process
of
putting
up
his
own
car
that
he
awaited
each
step
like
an
able
*NL*
executioner
condemned
to
his
own
rack
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
insultingly
cheerful
on
the
driveway
.
The
car
door
opened
and
*NL*
banged
shut
,
then
the
garage
door
slid
open
,
grating
on
the
sill
,
and
*NL*
the
car
door
again
.
The
motor
raced
for
the
climb
up
into
the
garage
and
*NL*
raced
once
more
,
explosively
,
before
it
was
shut
off
.
A
final
opening
*NL*
and
slamming
of
the
car
door
.
Silence
then
,
a
horrible
silence
filled
*NL*
with
waiting
,
till
the
leisurely
Mr.
Doppelbrau
had
examined
the
state
*NL*
of
his
tires
and
had
at
last
shut
the
garage
door
.
Instantly
,
for
*NL*
Babbitt
,
a
blessed
state
of
oblivion
.

At
that
moment
In
the
city
of
Zenith
,
Horace
Updike
was
making
love
to
*NL*
Lucile
McKelvey
in
her
mauve
drawing-room
on
Royal
Ridge
,
after
their
*NL*
return
from
a
lecture
by
an
eminent
English
novelist
.
Updike
was
*NL*
Zenith
's
professional
bachelor
;
a
slim-waisted
man
of
forty-six
with
*NL*
an
effeminate
voice
and
taste
in
flowers
,
cretonnes
,
and
flappers
.
Mrs.
*NL*
McKelvey
was
red-haired
,
creamy
,
discontented
,
exquisite
,
rude
,
and
*NL*
honest
.
Updike
tried
his
invariable
first
maneuver
--
touching
her
nervous
*NL*
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
an
idiot
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
awfully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
That
's
what
I
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
changed
to
conversation
.
He
was
famous
at
conversation
.
He
spoke
*NL*
reasonably
of
psychoanalysis
,
Long
Island
polo
,
and
the
Ming
platter
*NL*
he
had
found
in
Vancouver
.
She
promised
to
meet
him
in
Deauville
,
the
*NL*
coming
summer
,
``
though
,
''
she
sighed
,
``
it
's
becoming
too
dreadfully
*NL*
banal
;
nothing
but
Americans
and
frowsy
English
baronesses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
moment
in
Zenith
,
a
cocaine-runner
and
a
prostitute
were
*NL*
drinking
cocktails
in
Healey
Hanson
's
saloon
on
Front
Street
.
Since
*NL*
national
prohibition
was
now
in
force
,
and
since
Zenith
was
notoriously
*NL*
law-abiding
,
they
were
compelled
to
keep
the
cocktails
innocent
*NL*
by
drinking
them
out
of
tea-cups
.
The
lady
threw
her
cup
at
the
*NL*
cocaine-runner
's
head
.
He
worked
his
revolver
out
of
the
pocket
in
his
*NL*
sleeve
,
and
casually
murdered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
in
Zenith
,
two
men
sat
in
a
laboratory
.
For
thirty-seven
*NL*
hours
now
they
had
been
working
on
a
report
of
their
investigations
of
*NL*
synthetic
rubber
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
in
Zenith
,
there
was
a
conference
of
four
union
officials
*NL*
as
to
whether
the
twelve
thousand
coal-miners
within
a
hundred
miles
*NL*
of
the
city
should
strike
.
Of
these
men
one
resembled
a
testy
and
*NL*
prosperous
grocer
,
one
a
Yankee
carpenter
,
one
a
soda-clerk
,
and
one
*NL*
a
Russian
Jewish
actor
The
Russian
Jew
quoted
Kautsky
,
Gene
Debs
,
and
*NL*
Abraham
Lincoln
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
G.
A.
R.
veteran
was
dying
.
He
had
come
from
the
*NL*
Civil
War
straight
to
a
farm
which
,
though
it
was
officially
within
*NL*
the
city-limits
of
Zenith
,
was
primitive
as
the
backwoods
.
He
had
never
*NL*
ridden
in
a
motor
car
,
never
seen
a
bath-tub
,
never
read
any
book
save
*NL*
the
Bible
,
McGuffey
's
readers
,
and
religious
tracts
;
and
he
believed
*NL*
that
the
earth
is
flat
,
that
the
English
are
the
Lost
Ten
Tribes
of
*NL*
Israel
,
and
that
the
United
States
is
a
democracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
steel
and
cement
town
which
composed
the
factory
of
*NL*
the
Pullmore
Tractor
Company
of
Zenith
was
running
on
night
shift
to
*NL*
fill
an
order
of
tractors
for
the
Polish
army
.
It
hummed
like
a
million
*NL*
bees
,
glared
through
its
wide
windows
like
a
volcano
.
Along
the
high
*NL*
wire
fences
,
searchlights
played
on
cinder-lined
yards
,
switch-tracks
,
*NL*
and
armed
guards
on
patrol
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Mike
Monday
was
finishing
a
meeting
.
Mr.
Monday
,
the
*NL*
distinguished
evangelist
,
the
best-known
Protestant
pontiff
in
America
,
*NL*
had
once
been
a
prize-fighter
.
Satan
had
not
dealt
justly
with
him
.
As
*NL*
a
prize-fighter
he
gained
nothing
but
his
crooked
nose
,
his
celebrated
*NL*
vocabulary
,
and
his
stage-presence
.
The
service
of
the
Lord
had
been
*NL*
more
profitable
.
He
was
about
to
retire
with
a
fortune
.
It
had
been
well
*NL*
earned
,
for
,
to
quote
his
last
report
,
``
Rev.
Mr.
Monday
,
the
Prophet
*NL*
with
a
Punch
,
has
shown
that
he
is
the
world
's
greatest
salesman
of
*NL*
salvation
,
and
that
by
efficient
organization
the
overhead
of
spiritual
*NL*
regeneration
may
be
kept
down
to
an
unprecedented
rock-bottom
basis
.
He
*NL*
has
converted
over
two
hundred
thousand
lost
and
priceless
souls
at
an
*NL*
average
cost
of
less
than
ten
dollars
a
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
larger
cities
of
the
land
,
only
Zenith
had
hesitated
to
submit
*NL*
its
vices
to
Mike
Monday
and
his
expert
reclamation
corps
.
The
more
*NL*
enterprising
organizations
of
the
city
had
voted
to
invite
him
--
Mr.
*NL*
George
F.
Babbitt
had
once
praised
him
in
a
speech
at
the
Boosters
'
*NL*
Club
.
But
there
was
opposition
from
certain
Episcopalian
and
*NL*
Congregationalist
ministers
,
those
renegades
whom
Mr.
Monday
so
finely
*NL*
called
``
a
bunch
of
gospel-pushers
with
dish-water
instead
of
blood
,
a
*NL*
gang
of
squealers
that
need
more
dust
on
the
knees
of
their
pants
and
*NL*
more
hair
on
their
skinny
old
chests
.
''
This
opposition
had
been
*NL*
crushed
when
the
secretary
of
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
had
reported
to
a
*NL*
committee
of
manufacturers
that
in
every
city
where
he
had
appeared
,
Mr.
*NL*
Monday
had
turned
the
minds
of
workmen
from
wages
and
hours
to
higher
*NL*
things
,
and
thus
averted
strikes
.
He
was
immediately
invited
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
expense
fund
of
forty
thousand
dollars
had
been
underwritten
;
out
on
*NL*
the
County
Fair
Grounds
a
Mike
Monday
Tabernacle
had
been
erected
,
*NL*
to
seat
fifteen
thousand
people
.
In
it
the
prophet
was
at
this
moment
*NL*
concluding
his
message
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
lot
of
smart
college
professors
and
tea-guzzling
slobs
in
*NL*
this
burg
that
say
I
'm
a
roughneck
and
a
never-wuzzer
and
my
knowledge
*NL*
of
history
is
not-yet
.
Oh
,
there
's
a
gang
of
woolly-whiskered
book-lice
*NL*
that
think
they
know
more
than
Almighty
God
,
and
prefer
a
lot
of
Hun
*NL*
science
and
smutty
German
criticism
to
the
straight
and
simple
Word
*NL*
of
God

Oh
,
there
's
a
swell
bunch
of
Lizzie
boys
and
lemon-suckers
and
*NL*
pie-faces
and
infidels
and
beer-bloated
scribblers
that
love
to
fire
off
*NL*
their
filthy
mouths
and
yip
that
Mike
Monday
is
vulgar
and
full
of
mush

Those
pups
are
saying
now
that
I
hog
the
gospel-show

that
I
'm
in
it

Well

now

I
'm
going
to
give
those
birds
a

chance

can
stand
right
up
here

tell
me
to
my
face
that
I
'm
a

galoot

a
liar

a
hick

Only
if
they
do

they
do

do
n't
faint
*NL*
with
surprise
if
some
of
those
rum-dumm
liars
get
one
good
swift
poke
*NL*
from
Mike
,
with
all
the
kick
of
God

Flaming
Righteousness

the
*NL*
wallop

Who
says
it

Who
says
Mike

Do

I
see
anybody
standing
up

Well

there

you
are

Now
I

the
folks
in
this

will
quit
listening

all
this
kyoodling

quit
listening

to
the

vomit
out
filthy

Is
anything

with

can

having

I
get

in

an

was
homesick

what
I
fight
in

standardization

The
real
villains

the
clean

that
they

in

so
intelligent

You

are
the

Then
this

Thompson
were
in
conference

Offutt
suggested
,
``
The
thing
to
do
is
to
*NL*
get
your
fool
son-in-law
,
Babbitt
,
to
put
it
over
.
He
's
one
of
these
*NL*
patriotic
guys
.
When
he
grabs
a
piece
of
property
for
the
gang
,
he
makes
*NL*
it
look
like
we
were
dyin
'
of
love
for
the
dear
peepul
,
and
I
do
love
to
*NL*
buy
respectability
--
reasonable
.
Wonder
how
long
we
can
keep
it
up
,
Hank
?
*NL*
We
're
safe
as
long
as
the
good
little
boys
like
George
Babbitt
and
all
*NL*
the
nice
respectable
labor-leaders
think
you
and
me
are
rugged
patriots
.
*NL*
There
's
swell
pickings
for
an
honest
politician
here
,
Hank
:
a
whole
city
*NL*
working
to
provide
cigars
and
fried
chicken
and
dry
martinis
for
us
,
*NL*
and
rallying
to
our
banner
with
indignation
,
oh
,
fierce
indignation
,
*NL*
whenever
some
squealer
like
this
fellow
Seneca
Doane
comes
along
!
*NL*
Honest
,
Hank
,
a
smart
codger
like
me
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
if
*NL*
he
did
n't
milk
cattle
like
them
,
when
they
come
around
mooing
for
it
!
*NL*
But
the
Traction
gang
ca
n't
get
away
with
grand
larceny
like
it
used
*NL*
to
.
I
wonder
when
--
Hank
,
I
wish
we
could
fix
some
way
to
run
this
fellow
*NL*
Seneca
Doane
out
of
town
.
It
's
him
or
us
!

*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
in
Zenith
,
three
hundred
and
forty
or
fifty
thousand
*NL*
Ordinary
People
were
asleep
,
a
vast
unpenetrated
shadow
.
In
the
slum
*NL*
beyond
the
railroad
tracks
,
a
young
man
who
for
six
months
had
sought
*NL*
work
turned
on
the
gas
and
killed
himself
and
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Lloyd
Mallam
,
the
poet
,
owner
of
the
Hafiz
Book
Shop
,
*NL*
was
finishing
a
rondeau
to
show
how
diverting
was
life
amid
the
feuds
of
*NL*
medieval
Florence
,
but
how
dull
it
was
in
so
obvious
a
place
as
Zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
moment
George
F.
Babbitt
turned
ponderously
in
bed
--
the
*NL*
last
turn
,
signifying
that
he
'd
had
enough
of
this
worried
business
of
*NL*
falling
asleep
and
was
about
it
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
he
was
in
the
magic
dream
.
He
was
somewhere
among
unknown
*NL*
people
who
laughed
at
him
.
He
slipped
away
,
ran
down
the
paths
of
a
*NL*
midnight
garden
,
and
at
the
gate
the
fairy
child
was
waiting
.
Her
*NL*
dear
and
tranquil
hand
caressed
his
cheek
.
He
was
gallant
and
wise
and
*NL*
well-beloved
;
warm
ivory
were
her
arms

beyond
perilous
moors
the

brave
sea
glittered

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
great
events
of
Babbitt
's
spring
were
the
secret
buying
of
*NL*
real-estate
options
in
Linton
for
certain
street-traction
officials
,
*NL*
before
the
public
announcement
that
the
Linton
Avenue
Car
Line
would
be
*NL*
extended
,
and
a
dinner
which
was
,
as
he
rejoiced
to
his
wife
,
not
only
*NL*
``
a
regular
society
spread
but
a
real
sure-enough
highbrow
affair
,
with
*NL*
some
of
the
keenest
intellects
and
the
brightest
bunch
of
little
women
*NL*
in
town
.
''
It
was
so
absorbing
an
occasion
that
he
almost
forgot
his
*NL*
desire
to
run
off
to
Maine
with
Paul
Riesling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
had
been
born
in
the
village
of
Catawba
,
Babbitt
had
risen
*NL*
to
that
metropolitan
social
plane
on
which
hosts
have
as
many
as
four
*NL*
people
at
dinner
without
planning
it
for
more
than
an
evening
or
two
.
*NL*
But
a
dinner
of
twelve
,
with
flowers
from
the
florist
's
and
all
the
*NL*
cut-glass
out
,
staggered
even
the
Babbitts
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
weeks
they
studied
,
debated
,
and
arbitrated
the
list
of
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
marveled
,
``
Of
course
we
're
up-to-date
ourselves
,
but
still
,
*NL*
think
of
us
entertaining
a
famous
poet
like
Chum
Frink
,
a
fellow
that
on
*NL*
nothing
but
a
poem
or
so
every
day
and
just
writing
a
few
advertisements
*NL*
pulls
down
fifteen
thousand
berries
a
year
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
Howard
Littlefield
.
Do
you
know
,
the
other
evening
Eunice
told
*NL*
me
her
papa
speaks
three
languages
!
''
said
Mrs.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
That
's
nothing
!
So
do
I
--
American
,
baseball
,
and
poker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
's
nice
to
be
funny
about
a
matter
like
that
.
Think
how
*NL*
wonderful
it
must
be
to
speak
three
languages
,
and
so
useful
and
--
And
*NL*
with
people
like
that
,
I
do
n't
see
why
we
invite
the
Orville
Joneses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
Orville
is
a
mighty
up-and-coming
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
but
--
A
laundry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
admit
a
laundry
has
n't
got
the
class
of
poetry
or
real
estate

*NL*
but
just
the
same
,
Orvy
is
mighty
deep
.
Ever
start
him
spieling
about
*NL*
gardening
?
Say
,
that
fellow
can
tell
you
the
name
of
every
kind
of
tree
,
*NL*
and
some
of
their
Greek
and
Latin
names
too
!
Besides
,
we
owe
the
Joneses
*NL*
a
dinner
.
Besides
,
gosh
,
we
got
to
have
some
boob
for
audience
,
when
a
*NL*
bunch
of
hot-air
artists
like
Frink
and
Littlefield
get
going
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear

I
meant
to
speak
of
this

I
do
think
that

host
you
ought

to
sit
back

listen

Oh

anything
to

Well
,
let
me
tell
you
,
just
the
other
day
your
darn
*NL*
Chum
Frink
comes
up
to
me
at
the
club
begging
to
know
what
I
thought

about
the
Springfield
school-bond
issue

who
told
him

I
did

You

your

told

Little
me

I
certainly
did

He
came
up

asked
me
,

I
told
him
all
about
it

You
bet

he
was
darn
glad
to
*NL*
listen
to
me

Duty
as
a
host

I
guess
I
know
my
duty
as
a
host

*NL*
let
me
tell
you

*NL*
In
fact
,
the
Orville
Joneses
were
invited
.

*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
dinner
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
restive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

George
,
I
want
you

be

``
Uh-huh

Three
minutes
later
,
after
Babbitt
had
wailed
,
``
Well

I
do
n't
know

whether
I
'm
going

NOT

in
a
manner
which
showed
that
he
was
*NL*
going
to
dress

the
discussion
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

George

call
in
at
Vecchia

get
the
ice
cream

delivery-wagon
is
broken
down

trust

perfectly

the
table

order
the
salted
almonds

look
at
the
chickens

and
*NL*
arrange
for
the
children
to
have
their
supper
upstairs
and
--
And
I
simply
*NL*
must
depend
on
you
to
go
to

*NL*
``

riiiiiight

'm
going

get
it

*NL*
``
All
you
have
to

ordered

*NL*
*NL*
At
ten-thirty
she
telephoned
to
him
not
to
forget
the
ice
cream
from
*NL*
Vecchia
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
surprised
and
blasted
then
by
a
thought
.
He
wondered
whether
*NL*
Floral
Heights
dinners
were
worth
the
hideous
toil
involved
.
But
he
*NL*
repented
the
sacrilege
in
the
excitement
of
buying
the
materials
for
*NL*
cocktails
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
the
manner
of
obtaining
alcohol
under
the
reign
of
*NL*
righteousness
and
prohibition
:
*NL*
*NL*
He
drove
from
the
severe
rectangular
streets
of
the
modern
business
*NL*
center
into
the
tangled
byways
of
Old
Town
--
jagged
blocks
filled
with
*NL*
sooty
warehouses
and
lofts
;
on
into
The
Arbor
,
once
a
pleasant
orchard
*NL*
but
now
a
morass
of
lodging-houses
,
tenements
,
and
brothels
.
Exquisite
*NL*
shivers
chilled
his
spine
and
stomach
,
and
he
looked
at
every
policeman
*NL*
with
intense
innocence
,
as
one
who
loved
the
law
,
and
admired
the
Force
,
*NL*
and
longed
to
stop
and
play
with
them
.
He
parked
his
car
a
block
from
*NL*
Healey
Hanson
's
saloon
,
worrying
,
``
Well
,
rats
,
if
anybody
did
see
me
,
*NL*
they
'd
think
I
was
here
on
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
a
place
curiously
like
the
saloons
of
ante-prohibition
days
,
*NL*
with
a
long
greasy
bar
with
sawdust
in
front
and
streaky
mirror
behind
,
*NL*
a
pine
table
at
which
a
dirty
old
man
dreamed
over
a
glass
of
something
*NL*
which
resembled
whisky
,
and
with
two
men
at
the
bar
,
drinking
something
*NL*
which
resembled
beer
,
and
giving
that
impression
of
forming
a
large
*NL*
crowd
which
two
men
always
give
in
a
saloon
.
The
bartender
,
a
tall
pale
*NL*
Swede
with
a
diamond
in
his
lilac
scarf
,
stared
at
Babbitt
as
he
stalked
*NL*
plumply
up
to
the
bar
and
whispered
,
``
I
'd
,
uh
--
Friend
of
Hanson
's
sent
*NL*
me
here
.
Like
to
get
some
gin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bartender
gazed
down
on
him
in
the
manner
of
an
outraged
bishop
.
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
got
the
wrong
place
,
my
friend
.
We
sell
nothing
but
soft
*NL*
drinks
here
.
''
He
cleaned
the
bar
with
a
rag
which
would
itself
have
done
*NL*
with
a
little
cleaning
,
and
glared
across
his
mechanically
moving
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
dreamer
at
the
table
petitioned
the
bartender
,
``
Say
,
Oscar
,
*NL*
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscar
did
not
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
say
,
Oscar
,
listen
,
will
yuh
?
Say
,
lis-sen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
decayed
and
drowsy
voice
of
the
loafer
,
the
agreeable
stink
of
*NL*
beer-dregs
,
threw
a
spell
of
inanition
over
Babbitt
.
The
bartender
moved
*NL*
grimly
toward
the
crowd
of
two
men
.
Babbitt
followed
him
as
delicately
*NL*
as
a
cat
,
and
wheedled
,
``
Say
,
Oscar
,
I
want
to
speak
to
Mr.
Hanson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whajuh
wanta
see
him
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
want
to
talk
to
him

Here
's
my
card
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beautiful
card
,
an
engraved
card
,
a
card
in
the
blackest
black
*NL*
and
the
sharpest
red
,
announcing
that
Mr.
George
F.
Babbitt
was
Estates
,
*NL*
Insurance
,
Rents
.
The
bartender
held
it
as
though
it
weighed
ten
pounds
,
*NL*
and
read
it
as
though
it
were
a
hundred
words
long
.
He
did
not
bend
from
*NL*
his
episcopal
dignity
,
but
he
growled
,
``
I
'll
see
if
he
's
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
back
room
he
brought
an
immensely
old
young
man
,
a
quiet
*NL*
sharp-eyed
man
,
in
tan
silk
shirt
,
checked
vest
hanging
open
,
and
*NL*
burning
brown
trousers
--
Mr.
Healey
Hanson
.
Mr.
Hanson
said
only
``
Yuh
?
''
*NL*
but
his
implacable
and
contemptuous
eyes
queried
Babbitt
's
soul
,
and
he
*NL*
seemed
not
at
all
impressed
by
the
new
dark-gray
suit
for
which
-LRB-
as
he
*NL*
had
admitted
to
every
acquaintance
at
the
Athletic
Club
-RRB-
Babbitt
had
*NL*
paid
a
hundred
and
twenty-five
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

In
alarm
,
in
obsequiousness
,
as
Hanson
's
*NL*
eyes
grew
more
bored
,
``
You
telephone
to
Jake
about
me
,
if
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hanson
answered
by
jerking
his
head
to
indicate
the
entrance
to
the
*NL*
back
room
,
and
strolled
away
.
Babbitt
melodramatically
crept
into
*NL*
an
apartment
containing
four
round
tables
,
eleven
chairs
,
a
brewery
*NL*
calendar
,
and
a
smell
.
He
waited
.
Thrice
he
saw
Healey
Hanson
saunter
*NL*
through
,
humming
,
hands
in
pockets
,
ignoring
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Babbitt
had
modified
his
valiant
morning
vow
,
``
I
wo
n't
pay
*NL*
one
cent
over
seven
dollars
a
quart
''
to
``
I
might
pay
ten
.
''
On
Hanson
's
*NL*
next
weary
entrance
he
besought
``
Could
you
fix
that
up
?
''
Hanson
scowled
,
*NL*
and
grated
,
``
Just
a
minute
--
Pete
's
sake
--
just
a
min-ute
!
''
In
growing
*NL*
meekness
Babbitt
went
on
waiting
till
Hanson
casually
reappeared
with
*NL*
a
quart
of
gin
--
what
is
euphemistically
known
as
a
quart
--
in
his
*NL*
disdainful
long
white
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve
bucks
,
''
he
snapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
uh
,
but
say
,
cap'n
,
Jake
thought
you
'd
be
able
to
fix
me
up
for
*NL*
eight
or
nine
a
bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nup
.
Twelve
.
This
is
the
real
stuff
,
smuggled
from
Canada
.
This
is
*NL*
none
o
'
your
neutral
spirits
with
a
drop
of
juniper
extract
,
''
the
honest
*NL*
merchant
said
virtuously
.
``
Twelve
bones
--
if
you
want
it
.
Course
y
'
*NL*
understand
I
'm
just
doing
this
anyway
as
a
friend
of
Jake
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
!
Sure
!
I
understand
!
''
Babbitt
gratefully
held
out
twelve
dollars
.
*NL*
He
felt
honored
by
contact
with
greatness
as
Hanson
yawned
,
stuffed
the
*NL*
bills
,
uncounted
,
into
his
radiant
vest
,
and
swaggered
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
number
of
titillations
out
of
concealing
the
gin-bottle
under
*NL*
his
coat
and
out
of
hiding
it
in
his
desk
.
All
afternoon
he
snorted
and
*NL*
chuckled
and
gurgled
over
his
ability
to
``
give
the
Boys
a
real
shot
in
*NL*
the
arm
to-night
.
''
He
was
,
in
fact
,
so
exhilarated
that
he
was
within
a
*NL*
block
of
his
house
before
he
remembered
that
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
matter
,
mentioned
by
his
wife
,
of
fetching
ice
cream
from
Vecchia
's
.
He
*NL*
explained
,
``
Well
,
darn
it
--
''
and
drove
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vecchia
was
not
a
caterer
,
he
was
The
Caterer
of
Zenith
.
Most
coming-out
*NL*
parties
were
held
in
the
white
and
gold
ballroom
of
the
Maison
Vecchia
;
*NL*
at
all
nice
teas
the
guests
recognized
the
five
kinds
of
Vecchia
*NL*
sandwiches
and
the
seven
kinds
of
Vecchia
cakes
;
and
all
really
smart
*NL*
dinners
ended
,
as
on
a
resolving
chord
,
in
Vecchia
Neapolitan
ice
cream
*NL*
in
one
of
the
three
reliable
molds
--
the
melon
mold
,
the
round
mold
like
*NL*
a
layer
cake
,
and
the
long
brick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vecchia
's
shop
had
pale
blue
woodwork
,
tracery
of
plaster
roses
,
*NL*
attendants
in
frilled
aprons
,
and
glass
shelves
of
``
kisses
''
with
all
the
*NL*
refinement
that
inheres
in
whites
of
eggs
.
Babbitt
felt
heavy
and
thick
*NL*
amid
this
professional
daintiness
,
and
as
he
waited
for
the
ice
cream
he
*NL*
decided
,
with
hot
prickles
at
the
back
of
his
neck
,
that
a
girl
customer
*NL*
was
giggling
at
him
.
He
went
home
in
a
touchy
temper
.
The
first
thing
he
*NL*
heard
was
his
wife
's
agitated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
DID
you
remember
to
go
to
Vecchia
's
and
get
the
ice
cream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
!
Look
here
!
Do
I
ever
forget
to
do
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
Often
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
it
's
darn
seldom
I
do
,
and
it
certainly
makes
me
tired
,
after
*NL*
going
into
a
pink-tea
joint
like
Vecchia
's
and
having
to
stand
around
*NL*
looking
at
a
lot
of
half-naked
young
girls
,
all
rouged
up
like
they
were
*NL*
sixty
and
eating
a
lot
of
stuff
that
simply
ruins
their
stomachs
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
too
bad
about
you
!
I
've
noticed
how
you
hate
to
look
at
pretty
*NL*
girls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
jar
Babbitt
realized
that
his
wife
was
too
busy
to
be
impressed
*NL*
by
that
moral
indignation
with
which
males
rule
the
world
,
and
he
*NL*
went
humbly
up-stairs
to
dress
.
He
had
an
impression
of
a
glorified
*NL*
dining-room
,
of
cut-glass
,
candles
,
polished
wood
,
lace
,
silver
,
roses
.
*NL*
With
the
awed
swelling
of
the
heart
suitable
to
so
grave
a
business
as
*NL*
giving
a
dinner
,
he
slew
the
temptation
to
wear
his
plaited
dress-shirt
*NL*
for
a
fourth
time
,
took
out
an
entirely
fresh
one
,
tightened
his
black
*NL*
bow
,
and
rubbed
his
patent-leather
pumps
with
a
handkerchief
.
He
glanced
*NL*
with
pleasure
at
his
garnet
and
silver
studs
.
He
smoothed
and
patted
*NL*
his
ankles
,
transformed
by
silk
socks
from
the
sturdy
shanks
of
George
*NL*
Babbitt
to
the
elegant
limbs
of
what
is
called
a
Clubman
.
He
stood
*NL*
before
the
pier-glass
,
viewing
his
trim
dinner-coat
,
his
beautiful
*NL*
triple-braided
trousers
;
and
murmured
in
lyric
beatitude
,
``
By
golly
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
look
so
bad
.
I
certainly
do
n't
look
like
Catawba
.
If
the
hicks
*NL*
back
home
could
see
me
in
this
rig
,
they
'd
have
a
fit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
majestically
down
to
mix
the
cocktails
.
As
he
chipped
ice
,
as
*NL*
he
squeezed
oranges
,
as
he
collected
vast
stores
of
bottles
,
glasses
,
*NL*
and
spoons
at
the
sink
in
the
pantry
,
he
felt
as
authoritative
as
the
*NL*
bartender
at
Healey
Hanson
's
saloon
.
True
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
said
he
was
*NL*
under
foot
,
and
Matilda
and
the
maid
hired
for
the
evening
brushed
by
*NL*
him
,
elbowed
him
,
shrieked
``
Pleasopn
door
,
''
as
they
tottered
through
*NL*
with
trays
,
but
in
this
high
moment
he
ignored
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
new
bottle
of
gin
,
his
cellar
consisted
of
one
half-bottle
*NL*
of
Bourbon
whisky
,
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
of
Italian
vermouth
,
and
*NL*
approximately
one
hundred
drops
of
orange
bitters
.
He
did
not
possess
*NL*
a
cocktail-shaker
.
A
shaker
was
proof
of
dissipation
,
the
symbol
of
a
*NL*
Drinker
,
and
Babbitt
disliked
being
known
as
a
Drinker
even
more
than
*NL*
he
liked
a
Drink
.
He
mixed
by
pouring
from
an
ancient
gravy-boat
into
a
*NL*
handleless
pitcher
;
he
poured
with
a
noble
dignity
,
holding
his
alembics
*NL*
high
beneath
the
powerful
Mazda
globe
,
his
face
hot
,
his
shirt-front
a
*NL*
glaring
white
,
the
copper
sink
a
scoured
red-gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tasted
the
sacred
essence
.
``
Now
,
by
golly
,
if
that
is
n't
pretty
*NL*
near
one
fine
old
cocktail
!
Kind
of
a
Bronx
,
and
yet
like
a
Manhattan
.
*NL*
Ummmmmm
!
Hey
,
Myra
,
want
a
little
nip
before
the
folks
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bustling
into
the
dining-room
,
moving
each
glass
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
inch
,
rushing
back
with
resolution
implacable
on
her
face
her
gray
and
*NL*
silver-lace
party
frock
protected
by
a
denim
towel
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
glared
*NL*
at
him
,
and
rebuked
him
,
``
Certainly
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
in
a
loose
,
jocose
manner
,
``
I
think
the
old
man
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cocktail
filled
him
with
a
whirling
exhilaration
behind
which
he
*NL*
was
aware
of
devastating
desires
--
to
rush
places
in
fast
motors
,
to
kiss
*NL*
girls
,
to
sing
,
to
be
witty
.
He
sought
to
regain
his
lost
dignity
by
*NL*
announcing
to
Matilda
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
stick
this
pitcher
of
cocktails
in
the
refrigerator
.
Be
*NL*
sure
you
do
n't
upset
any
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
sure
now
.
Do
n't
go
putting
anything
on
this
top
shelf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
be
--
''
He
was
dizzy
.
His
voice
was
thin
and
distant
.
``
Whee
!
''
With
*NL*
enormous
impressiveness
he
commanded
,
``
Well
,
be
sure
now
,
''
and
minced
*NL*
into
the
safety
of
the
living-room
.
He
wondered
whether
he
could
*NL*
persuade
``
as
slow
a
bunch
as
Myra
and
the
Littlefields
to
go
some
place
*NL*
aft
'
dinner
and
raise
Cain
and
maybe
dig
up
smore
booze
.
''
He
perceived
*NL*
that
he
had
gifts
of
profligacy
which
had
been
neglected
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
the
guests
had
come
,
including
the
inevitable
late
couple
*NL*
for
whom
the
others
waited
with
painful
amiability
,
a
great
gray
*NL*
emptiness
had
replaced
the
purple
swirling
in
Babbitt
's
head
,
and
he
had
*NL*
to
force
the
tumultuous
greetings
suitable
to
a
host
on
Floral
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
were
Howard
Littlefield
,
the
doctor
of
philosophy
who
*NL*
furnished
publicity
and
comforting
economics
to
the
Street
Traction
*NL*
Company
;
Vergil
Gunch
,
the
coal-dealer
,
equally
powerful
in
the
Elks
*NL*
and
in
the
Boosters
'
Club
;
Eddie
Swanson
the
agent
for
the
Javelin
Motor
*NL*
Car
,
who
lived
across
the
street
;
and
Orville
Jones
,
owner
of
the
Lily
*NL*
White
Laundry
,
which
justly
announced
itself
``
the
biggest
,
busiest
,
*NL*
bulliest
cleanerie
shoppe
in
Zenith
.
''
But
,
naturally
,
the
most
*NL*
distinguished
of
all
was
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
,
who
was
not
only
the
*NL*
author
of
``
Poemulations
,
''
which
,
syndicated
daily
in
sixty-seven
leading
*NL*
newspapers
,
gave
him
one
of
the
largest
audiences
of
any
poet
in
the
*NL*
world
,
but
also
an
optimistic
lecturer
and
the
creator
of
``
Ads
that
*NL*
Add
.
''
Despite
the
searching
philosophy
and
high
morality
of
his
verses
,
*NL*
they
were
humorous
and
easily
understood
by
any
child
of
twelve
;
and
it
*NL*
added
a
neat
air
of
pleasantry
to
them
that
they
were
set
not
as
verse
*NL*
but
as
prose
.
Mr.
Frink
was
known
from
Coast
to
Coast
as
``
Chum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
them
were
six
wives
,
more
or
less
--
it
was
hard
to
tell
,
so
early
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
as
at
first
glance
they
all
looked
alike
,
and
as
they
all
*NL*
said
,
``
Oh
,
IS
N'T
this
nice
!
''
in
the
same
tone
of
determined
liveliness
.
*NL*
To
the
eye
,
the
men
were
less
similar
:
Littlefield
,
a
hedge-scholar
,
*NL*
tall
and
horse-faced
;
Chum
Frink
,
a
trifle
of
a
man
with
soft
and
*NL*
mouse-like
hair
,
advertising
his
profession
as
poet
by
a
silk
cord
on
*NL*
his
eye-glasses
;
Vergil
Gunch
,
broad
,
with
coarse
black
hair
en
brosse
;
*NL*
Eddie
Swanson
,
a
bald
and
bouncing
young
man
who
showed
his
taste
*NL*
for
elegance
by
an
evening
waistcoat
of
figured
black
silk
with
glass
*NL*
buttons
;
Orville
Jones
,
a
steady-looking
,
stubby
,
not
very
memorable
*NL*
person
,
with
a
hemp-colored
toothbrush
mustache
.
Yet
they
were
all
so
*NL*
well
fed
and
clean
,
they
all
shouted
''
`
Evenin
'
,
Georgie
!
''
with
such
*NL*
robustness
,
that
they
seemed
to
be
cousins
,
and
the
strange
thing
is
*NL*
that
the
longer
one
knew
the
women
,
the
less
alike
they
seemed
;
*NL*
while
the
longer
one
knew
the
men
,
the
more
alike
their
bold
patterns
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drinking
of
the
cocktails
was
as
canonical
a
rite
as
the
mixing
.
The
*NL*
company
waited
,
uneasily
,
hopefully
,
agreeing
in
a
strained
manner
that
*NL*
the
weather
had
been
rather
warm
and
slightly
cold
,
but
still
Babbitt
*NL*
said
nothing
about
drinks
.
They
became
despondent
.
But
when
the
late
*NL*
couple
-LRB-
the
Swansons
-RRB-
had
arrived
,
Babbitt
hinted
,
``
Well
,
folks
,
do
you
*NL*
think
you
could
stand
breaking
the
law
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
Chum
Frink
,
the
recognized
lord
of
language
.
Frink
pulled
*NL*
at
his
eye-glass
cord
as
at
a
bell-rope
,
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
*NL*
that
which
was
the
custom
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
George
:
I
'm
a
law-abiding
man
,
but
they
do
say
Verg
*NL*
Gunch
is
a
regular
yegg
,
and
of
course
he
's
bigger
'n
I
am
,
and
I
just
*NL*
ca
n't
figure
out
what
I
'd
do
if
he
tried
to
force
me
into
anything
*NL*
criminal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gunch
was
roaring
,
``
Well
,
I
'll
take
a
chance
--
''
when
Frink
held
up
his
*NL*
hand
and
went
on
,
``
So
if
Verg
and
you
insist
,
Georgie
,
I
'll
park
my
car
*NL*
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
,
because
I
take
it
for
granted
that
's
*NL*
the
crime
you
're
hinting
at
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
deal
of
laughter
.
Mrs.
Jones
asserted
,
``
Mr.
Frink
is
*NL*
simply
too
killing
!
You
'd
think
he
was
so
innocent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
clamored
,
``
How
did
you
guess
it
,
Chum
?
Well
,
you-all
just
wait
*NL*
a
moment
while
I
go
out
and
get
the
--
keys
to
your
cars
!
''
Through
a
froth
*NL*
of
merriment
he
brought
the
shining
promise
,
the
mighty
tray
of
glasses
*NL*
with
the
cloudy
yellow
cocktails
in
the
glass
pitcher
in
the
center
.
The
*NL*
men
babbled
,
``
Oh
,
gosh
,
have
a
look
!
''
and
``
This
gets
me
right
where
I
*NL*
live
!
''
and
``
Let
me
at
it
!
''
But
Chum
Frink
,
a
traveled
man
and
not
unused
*NL*
to
woes
,
was
stricken
by
the
thought
that
the
potion
might
be
merely
*NL*
fruit-juice
with
a
little
neutral
spirits
.
He
looked
timorous
as
*NL*
Babbitt
,
a
moist
and
ecstatic
almoner
,
held
out
a
glass
,
but
as
he
*NL*
tasted
it
he
piped
,
``
Oh
,
man
,
let
me
dream
on
!
It
ai
n't
true
,
but
do
n't
*NL*
waken
me
!
Jus
'
lem
me
slumber

''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hours
before
,
Frink
had
completed
a
newspaper
lyric
beginning
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sat
alone
and
groused
and
thunk
,
and
scratched
my
head
and
sighed
*NL*
and
wunk
,
and
groaned
,
There
still
are
boobs
,
alack
,
who
'd
like
the
*NL*
old-time
gin-mill
back
;
that
den
that
makes
a
sage
a
loon
,
the
vile
and
*NL*
smelly
old
saloon
!
I
'll
never
miss
their
poison
booze
,
whilst
I
the
*NL*
bubbling
spring
can
use
,
that
leaves
my
head
at
merry
morn
as
clear
as
*NL*
any
babe
new-born
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
drank
with
the
others
;
his
moment
's
depression
was
gone
;
he
*NL*
perceived
that
these
were
the
best
fellows
in
the
world
;
he
wanted
to
*NL*
give
them
a
thousand
cocktails
.
``
Think
you
could
stand
another
?
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
The
wives
refused
,
with
giggles
,
but
the
men
,
speaking
in
a
wide
,
*NL*
elaborate
,
enjoyable
manner
,
gloated
,
``
Well
,
sooner
than
have
you
get
*NL*
sore
at
me
,
Georgie
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
a
little
dividend
coming
,
''
said
Babbitt
to
each
of
them
,
and
*NL*
each
intoned
,
``
Squeeze
it
,
Georgie
,
squeeze
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
beyond
hope
,
the
pitcher
was
empty
,
they
stood
and
talked
about
*NL*
prohibition
.
The
men
leaned
back
on
their
heels
,
put
their
hands
in
*NL*
their
trousers-pockets
,
and
proclaimed
their
views
with
the
booming
*NL*
profundity
of
a
prosperous
male
repeating
a
thoroughly
hackneyed
*NL*
statement
about
a
matter
of
which
he
knows
nothing
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Vergil
Gunch
;
``
way
I
figure
it
is
this
,
and
*NL*
I
can
speak
by
the
book
,
because
I
've
talked
to
a
lot
of
doctors
and
*NL*
fellows
that
ought
to
know
,
and
the
way
I
see
it
is
that
it
's
a
good
*NL*
thing
to
get
rid
of
the
saloon
,
but
they
ought
to
let
a
fellow
have
beer
*NL*
and
light
wines
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Howard
Littlefield
observed
,
``
What
is
n't
generally
realized
is
that
it
's
*NL*
a
dangerous
prop
`
sition
to
invade
the
rights
of
personal
liberty
.
*NL*
Now
,
take
this
for
instance
:
The
King
of
--
Bavaria
?
I
think
it
was
*NL*
Bavaria
--
yes
,
Bavaria
,
it
was
--
in
1862
,
March
,
1862
,
he
issued
a
*NL*
proclamation
against
public
grazing
of
live-stock
.
The
peasantry
had
*NL*
stood
for
overtaxation
without
the
slightest
complaint
,
but
when
this
*NL*
proclamation
came
out
,
they
rebelled
.
Or
it
may
have
been
Saxony
.
But
*NL*
it
just
goes
to
show
the
dangers
of
invading
the
rights
of
personal
*NL*
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
--
no
one
got
a
right
to
invade
personal
liberty
,
''
said
Orville
*NL*
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
same
,
you
do
n't
want
to
forget
prohibition
is
a
mighty
good
*NL*
thing
for
the
working-classes
.
Keeps
'em
from
wasting
their
money
and
*NL*
lowering
their
productiveness
,
''
said
Vergil
Gunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
so
.
But
the
trouble
is
the
manner
of
enforcement
,
''
insisted
*NL*
Howard
Littlefield
.
``
Congress
did
n't
understand
the
right
system
.
Now
,
*NL*
if
I
'd
been
running
the
thing
,
I
'd
have
arranged
it
so
that
the
drinker
*NL*
himself
was
licensed
,
and
then
we
could
have
taken
care
of
the
shiftless
*NL*
workman
--
kept
him
from
drinking
--
and
yet
not
've
interfered
with
the
*NL*
rights
--
with
the
personal
liberty
--
of
fellows
like
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
bobbed
their
heads
,
looked
admiringly
at
one
another
,
and
stated
,
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
that
would
be
the
stunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thing
that
worries
me
is
that
a
lot
of
these
guys
will
take
to
*NL*
cocaine

sighed
Eddie
Swanson
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
bobbed
more
violently
,
and
groaned
,
``
That
's
so
,
there
is
a
danger
*NL*
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chum
Frink
chanted
,
``
Oh

got
hold

*NL*
*NL*
Gunch
interrupted
,

Littlefield
snorted
,
*NL*
``

Jones
insisted

Swanson
begged

But
Frink
went
on
resolutely

the
shells

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
turned
toward
them
with
yearning
sweetness
;
Frink
hastened
*NL*
to
finish
even
his
best
beer-recipe
;
and
she
said
gaily
,
``
Dinner
is
*NL*
served
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
deal
of
friendly
argument
among
the
men
as
to
which
*NL*
should
go
in
last
,
and
while
they
were
crossing
the
hall
from
the
*NL*
living-room
to
the
dining-room
Vergil
Gunch
made
them
laugh
by
*NL*
thundering
,
``
If
I
ca
n't
sit
next
to
Myra
Babbitt
and
hold
her
hand
under
*NL*
the
table
,
I
wo
n't
play
--
I
'm
goin
'
home
.
''
In
the
dining-room
they
stood
*NL*
embarrassed
while
Mrs.
Babbitt
fluttered
,
``
Now
,
let
me
see
--
Oh
,
I
was
*NL*
going
to
have
some
nice
hand-painted
place-cards
for
you
but
--
Oh
,
let
me
*NL*
see
;
Mr.
Frink
,
you
sit
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
in
the
best
style
of
women
's
-
magazine
art
,
whereby
the
*NL*
salad
was
served
in
hollowed
apples
,
and
everything
but
the
invincible
*NL*
fried
chicken
resembled
something
else
.
Ordinarily
the
men
found
it
hard
*NL*
to
talk
to
the
women
;
flirtation
was
an
art
unknown
on
Floral
Heights
,
*NL*
and
the
realms
of
offices
and
of
kitchens
had
no
alliances
.
But
under
*NL*
the
inspiration
of
the
cocktails
,
conversation
was
violent
.
Each
of
the
*NL*
men
still
had
a
number
of
important
things
to
say
about
prohibition
,
and
*NL*
now
that
each
had
a
loyal
listener
in
his
dinner-partner
he
burst
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
a
place
where
I
can
get
all
the
hootch
I
want
at
eight
a
*NL*
quart
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
read
about
this
fellow
that
went
and
paid
a
thousand
dollars
*NL*
for
ten
cases
of
red-eye
that
proved
to
be
nothing
but
water
?
Seems
this
*NL*
fellow
was
standing
on
the
corner
and
fellow
comes
up
to
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
there
's
a
whole
raft
of
stuff
being
smuggled
across
at
*NL*
Detroit
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
always
say
is
--
what
a
lot
of
folks
do
n't
realize
about
*NL*
prohibition
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
get
all
this
awful
poison
stuff
--
wood
alcohol
and
*NL*
everything
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
I
believe
in
it
on
principle
,
but
I
do
n't
propose
to
have
*NL*
anybody
telling
me
what
I
got
to
think
and
do
.
No
American
'll
ever
*NL*
stand
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
all
felt
that
it
was
rather
in
bad
taste
for
Orville
Jones
--
and
*NL*
he
not
recognized
as
one
of
the
wits
of
the
occasion
anyway
--
to
say
,
``
In
*NL*
fact
,
the
whole
thing
about
prohibition
is
this
:
it
is
n't
the
initial
*NL*
cost
,
it
's
the
humidity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
till
the
one
required
topic
had
been
dealt
with
did
the
conversation
*NL*
become
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
often
and
admiringly
said
of
Vergil
Gunch
,
``
Gee
,
that
fellow
can
*NL*
get
away
with
murder
!
Why
,
he
can
pull
a
Raw
One
in
mixed
company
and
*NL*
all
the
ladies
'll
laugh
their
heads
off
,
but
me
,
gosh
,
if
I
crack
*NL*
anything
that
's
just
the
least
bit
off
color
I
get
the
razz
for
fair
!
''
*NL*
Now
Gunch
delighted
them
by
crying
to
Mrs.
Eddie
Swanson
,
youngest
*NL*
of
the
women
,
``
Louetta
!
I
managed
to
pinch
Eddie
's
doorkey
out
of
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
what
say

me
sneak
across
the
street
when
the
folks
*NL*
are
n't
looking

Got
something

with
a
gorgeous
leer
,
``
awful
important
*NL*
to
tell
you

*NL*
*NL*
The
women
wriggled
,
and
Babbitt
was
stirred
to
like
naughtiness
.
``
Say

*NL*
folks

I
wished
I
dared
show
you
a
book

Patten

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

George
!
The
idea

Mrs.
Babbitt
warned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
book

racy
is
n't
the
word

It
's
some
kind
of
an
anthropological

report
about

about
Customs
,
in
the
South
Seas
,
and
what
it
does
n't

Verg

I
'll
lend

*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
first

insisted
Eddie
Swanson
.
``
Sounds
spicy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Orville
Jones
announced
,
``
Say
,
I
heard
a
Good
One
the
other
day
about

and
,
in
the
best
Jewish
accent
,
he
*NL*
resolutely
carried
the
Good

to
a
slightly
disinfected
ending
.
*NL*
Gunch
capped
it
.
But
the
cocktails
waned
,
the
seekers
dropped
back
into
*NL*
cautious
reality

*NL*
*NL*
Chum
Frink
had
recently
been
on
a
lecture-tour
among
the
small
towns
,
*NL*
and
he
chuckled
,
``
Awful
good

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

exulted
Orville
Jones

I
do

here
now
,
he
'd
think
we
*NL*
were
a
bunch
of
--
of
--
Why
,
gosh
,
I
swear
,
he
would
n't
know
what
to
think
!
*NL*
Yes
,
sir
,
they
're
jealous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chum
Frink
agreed
,
``
That
's
so
.
But
what
I
mind
is
their
lack
of
culture
*NL*
and
appreciation
of
the
Beautiful
--
if
you
'll
excuse
me
for
being
*NL*
highbrow
.
Now
,
I
like
to
give
a
high-class
lecture
,
and
read
some
of
my
*NL*
best
poetry
--
not
the
newspaper
stuff
but
the
magazine
things
.
But
say
,
*NL*
when
I
get
out
in
the
tall
grass
,
there
's
nothing
will
take
but
a
lot
of
*NL*
cheesy
old
stories
and
slang
and
junk
that
if
any
of
us
were
to
indulge
*NL*
in
it
here
,
he
'd
get
the
gate
so
fast
it
would
make
his
head
swim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
summed
it
up
:
``
Fact
is
,
we
're
mighty
lucky
to
be
living
*NL*
among
a
bunch
of
city-folks
,
that
recognize
artistic
things
and
*NL*
business-punch
equally
.
We
'd
feel
pretty
glum
if
we
got
stuck
in
some
*NL*
Main
Street
burg
and
tried
to
wise
up
the
old
codgers
to
the
kind
of
*NL*
life
we
're
used
to
here
.
But
,
by
golly
,
there
's
this
you
got
to
say
for
*NL*
'em
:
Every
small
American
town
is
trying
to
get
population
and
modern
*NL*
ideals
.
And
darn
if
a
lot
of
'em
do
n't
put
it
across
!
Somebody
starts
*NL*
panning
a
rube
crossroads
,
telling
how
he
was
there
in
1900
and
it
*NL*
consisted
of
one
muddy
street
,
count
'em
,
one
,
and
nine
hundred
human
*NL*
clams
.
Well
,
you
go
back
there
in
1920
,
and
you
find
pavements
and
a
*NL*
swell
little
hotel
and
a
first-class
ladies
'
ready-to-wear
shop-real
*NL*
perfection
,
in
fact
!
You
do
n't
want
to
just
look
at
what
these
small
*NL*
towns
are
,
you
want
to
look
at
what
they
're
aiming
to
become
,
and
they
*NL*
all
got
an
ambition
that
in
the
long
run
is
going
to
make
'em
the
finest
*NL*
spots
on
earth
--
they
all
want
to
be
just
like
Zenith

*NL*
*NL*
However
intimate
they
might
be
with
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
as
a
neighbor
,
*NL*
as
a
borrower
of
lawn-mowers
and
monkey-wrenches
,
they
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
also
a
Famous
Poet
and
a
distinguished
advertising-agent
;
that
behind
*NL*
his
easiness
were
sultry
literary
mysteries
which
they
could
not
*NL*
penetrate
.
But
to-night
,
in
the
gin-evolved
confidence
,
he
admitted
them
*NL*
to
the
arcanum
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
literary
problem
that
's
worrying
me
to
death
.
I
'm
doing
a
*NL*
series
of
ads
for
the
Zeeco
Car
and
I
want
to
make
each
of
'em
a
real
*NL*
little
gem
--
reg
`
lar
stylistic
stuff
.
I
'm
all
for
this
theory
that
*NL*
perfection
is
the
stunt
,
or
nothing
at
all
,
and
these
are
as
tough
*NL*
things
as
I
ever
tackled
.
You
might
think
it
'd
be
harder
to
do
my
*NL*
poems
--
all
these
Heart
Topics
:
home
and
fireside
and
happiness
--
but
*NL*
they
're
cinches
.
You
ca
n't
go
wrong
on
'em
;
you
know
what
sentiments
*NL*
any
decent
go-ahead
fellow
must
have
if
he
plays
the
game
,
and
you
stick
*NL*
right
to
'em
.
But
the
poetry
of
industrialism
,
now
there
's
a
literary
*NL*
line
where
you
got
to
open
up
new
territory
.
Do
you
know
the
fellow
*NL*
who
's
really
THE
American
genius
?
The
fellow
who
you
do
n't
know
his
*NL*
name
and
I
do
n't
either
,
but
his
work
ought
to
be
preserved
so
's
future
*NL*
generations
can
judge
our
American
thought
and
originality
to-day
?
Why
,
*NL*
the
fellow
that
writes
the
Prince
Albert
Tobacco
ads
!
Just
listen
to
*NL*
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
It
's
P.A.
that
jams
such
joy
in
jimmy
pipes
.
Say
--
bet
you
've
often
*NL*
bent-an-ear
to
that
spill-of-speech
about
hopping
from
five
to
*NL*
f-i-f-t-y
p-e-r
by
``
stepping
on
her
a
bit
!
''
Guess
that
's
going
some
,
all
*NL*
right
--
BUT
just
among
ourselves
,
you
better
start
a
rapidwhiz
system
*NL*
to
keep
tabs
as
to
how
fast
you
'll
buzz
from
low
smoke
spirits
to
*NL*
TIP-TOP-HIGH
--
once
you
line
up
behind
a
jimmy
pipe
that
's
all
aglow
with
*NL*
that
peach-of-a-pal
,
Prince
Albert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prince
Albert
is
john-on-the-job
--
always
joy'usly
more-ISH
in
flavor
;
*NL*
always
delightfully
cool
and
fragrant
!
For
a
fact
,
you
never
hooked
such
*NL*
double-decked
,
copper-riveted
,
two-fisted
smoke
enjoyment
!
*NL*
*NL*
Go
to
a
pipe
--
speed-o-quick
like
you
light
on
a
good
thing
!
Why
--
packed
*NL*
with
Prince
Albert
you
can
play
a
joy'us
jimmy
straight
across
the
*NL*
boards
!
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THAT
MEANS
!

*NL*

``
Now

caroled
the
motor
agent

Eddie
Swanson
,
``

what
I

just
one

he

for

for

I

tip
my
benny
to
him

The
only
thing
is
:
I
wonder
if
it
sells
the
goods

*NL*
Course
,
like
all
these
poets
,
this
Prince
Albert
fellow
lets
his
idea
*NL*
run
away
with
him

It
makes
elegant
reading

it
do
n't
say
nothing

*NL*
I
'd
never
go
out
and
buy
Prince
Albert
Tobacco
after
reading
it
,
because
*NL*
it
does
n't
tell
me
anything
about
the
stuff

It
's
just
a
bunch
of
*NL*
fluff

''
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
faced
him
:
``
Oh
,
you
're
crazy
!
Have
I
got
to
sell
you
the
idea

Anyway

the
kind
of
stuff
I
'd
like
to
do
for
the
Zeeco

But
*NL*
I
simply
ca
n't
.
So
I
decided
to
stick
to
the
straight
poetic
,
and
I
took
*NL*
a
shot
at
a
highbrow
ad
for
the
Zeeco
.
How
do
you
like
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
The

white
trail
is
calling

calling-and
it
's
over

far
*NL*
away
for
every
man

that
has
red
blood
in
his
veins
and
on
his
*NL*
lips
the
ancient
song
of
the
buccaneers

It
's
away
with
dull
drudging

*NL*
and
a

Speed

Speed

it
's
more
than
just
a
*NL*
moment
's
exhilaration

it
's
Life

This
great
new
truth
*NL*
the
makers
of
the
Zeeco

have
considered
as
much
as

*NL*
It

fleet
as

smooth

as

mused

's
got
an
elegant

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
BABBITT
was
fond
of
his
friends
,
he
loved
the
importance
of
being
host
*NL*
and
shouting
,
``
Certainly
,
you
're
going
to
have
smore
chicken
--
the
idea
!
''
*NL*
and
he
appreciated
the
genius
of
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
,
but
the
vigor
*NL*
of
the
cocktails
was
gone
,
and
the
more
he
ate
the
less
joyful
he
*NL*
felt
.
Then
the
amity
of
the
dinner
was
destroyed
by
the
nagging
of
the
*NL*
Swansons
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Floral
Heights
and
the
other
prosperous
sections
of
Zenith
,
*NL*
especially
in
the
``
young
married
set
,
''
there
were
many
women
who
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
.
Though
they
had
few
servants
,
yet
with
gas
stoves
,
*NL*
electric
ranges
and
dish-washers
and
vacuum
cleaners
,
and
tiled
kitchen
*NL*
walls
,
their
houses
were
so
convenient
that
they
had
little
housework
,
*NL*
and
much
of
their
food
came
from
bakeries
and
delicatessens
.
They
had
*NL*
but
two
,
one
,
or
no
children
;
and
despite
the
myth
that
the
Great
War
*NL*
had
made
work
respectable
,
their
husbands
objected
to
their
``
wasting
*NL*
time
and
getting
a
lot
of
crank
ideas
''
in
unpaid
social
work
,
and
still
*NL*
more
to
their
causing
a
rumor
,
by
earning
money
,
that
they
were
not
*NL*
adequately
supported
.
They
worked
perhaps
two
hours
a
day
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
time
they
ate
chocolates
,
went
to
the
motion-pictures
,
went
*NL*
window-shopping
,
went
in
gossiping
twos
and
threes
to
card-parties
,
*NL*
read
magazines
,
thought
timorously
of
the
lovers
who
never
appeared
,
*NL*
and
accumulated
a
splendid
restlessness
which
they
got
rid
of
by
nagging
*NL*
their
husbands
.
The
husbands
nagged
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
naggers
the
Swansons
were
perfect
specimens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
dinner
Eddie
Swanson
had
been
complaining
,
publicly
,
*NL*
about
his
wife
's
new
frock
.
It
was
,
he
submitted
,
too
short
,
too
low
,
*NL*
too
immodestly
thin
,
and
much
too
expensive
.
He
appealed
to
Babbitt
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest
,
George
,
what
do
you
think
of
that
rag
Louetta
went
and
bought
?
*NL*
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
the
limit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
eating
you
,
Eddie
?
I
call
it
a
swell
little
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
,
Mr.
Swanson
.
It
's
a
sweet
frock
,
''
Mrs.
Babbitt
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
do
you
see
,
smarty
!
You
're
such
an
authority
on
clothes
!
''
*NL*
Louetta
raged
,
while
the
guests
ruminated
and
peeped
at
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
now
,
''
said
Swanson
.
``
I
'm
authority
enough
so
I
know
it
*NL*
was
a
waste
of
money
,
and
it
makes
me
tired
to
see
you
not
wearing
out
a
*NL*
whole
closetful
of
clothes
you
got
already
.
I
've
expressed
my
idea
about
*NL*
this
before
,
and
you
know
good
and
well
you
did
n't
pay
the
least
bit
of
*NL*
attention
.
I
have
to
camp
on
your
trail
to
get
you
to
do
anything
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
more
of
it
,
and
they
all
assisted
,
all
but
Babbitt
.
*NL*
Everything
about
him
was
dim
except
his
stomach
,
and
that
was
a
bright
*NL*
scarlet
disturbance
.
``
Had
too
much
grub
;
ought
n't
to
eat
this
stuff
,
''
*NL*
he
groaned
--
while
he
went
on
eating
,
while
he
gulped
down
a
chill
and
*NL*
glutinous
slice
of
the
ice-cream
brick
,
and
cocoanut
cake
as
oozy
as
*NL*
shaving-cream
.
He
felt
as
though
he
had
been
stuffed
with
clay
;
his
body
*NL*
was
bursting
,
his
throat
was
bursting
,
his
brain
was
hot
mud
;
and
only
*NL*
with
agony
did
he
continue
to
smile
and
shout
as
became
a
host
on
Floral
*NL*
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
,
except
for
his
guests
,
have
fled
outdoors
and
walked
off
the
*NL*
intoxication
of
food
,
but
in
the
haze
which
filled
the
room
they
sat
*NL*
forever
,
talking
,
talking
,
while
he
agonized
,
``
Darn
fool
to
be
eating
*NL*
all
this
--
not
`
nother
mouthful
,
''
and
discovered
that
he
was
again
*NL*
tasting
the
sickly
welter
of
melted
ice
cream
on
his
plate
.
There
was
*NL*
no
magic
in
his
friends
;
he
was
not
uplifted
when
Howard
Littlefield
*NL*
produced
from
his
treasure-house
of
scholarship
the
information
that
the
*NL*
chemical
symbol
for
raw
rubber
is
C10H16
,
which
turns
into
isoprene
,
*NL*
or
2C5H8
.
Suddenly
,
without
precedent
,
Babbitt
was
not
merely
bored
but
*NL*
admitting
that
he
was
bored
.
It
was
ecstasy
to
escape
from
the
table
,
*NL*
from
the
torture
of
a
straight
chair
,
and
loll
on
the
davenport
in
the
*NL*
living-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
,
from
their
fitful
unconvincing
talk
,
their
expressions
of
*NL*
being
slowly
and
painfully
smothered
,
seemed
to
be
suffering
from
the
*NL*
toil
of
social
life
and
the
horror
of
good
food
as
much
as
himself
.
All
*NL*
of
them
accepted
with
relief
the
suggestion
of
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
recovered
from
the
feeling
of
being
boiled
.
He
won
at
bridge
.
*NL*
He
was
again
able
to
endure
Vergil
Gunch
's
inexorable
heartiness
.
But
*NL*
he
pictured
loafing
with
Paul
Riesling
beside
a
lake
in
Maine
.
It
was
as
*NL*
overpowering
and
imaginative
as
homesickness
.
He
had
never
seen
Maine
,
*NL*
yet
he
beheld
the
shrouded
mountains
,
the
tranquil
lake
of
evening
.
*NL*
``
That
boy
Paul
's
worth
all
these
ballyhooing
highbrows
put
together
,
''
he
*NL*
muttered
;
and
,
``
I
'd
like
to
get
away
from
--
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Louetta
Swanson
did
not
rouse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Swanson
was
pretty
and
pliant
.
Babbitt
was
not
an
analyst
of
women
,
*NL*
except
as
to
their
tastes
in
Furnished
Houses
to
Rent
.
He
divided
them
*NL*
into
Real
Ladies
,
Working
Women
,
Old
Cranks
,
and
Fly
Chickens
.
He
mooned
*NL*
over
their
charms
but
he
was
of
opinion
that
all
of
them
-LRB-
save
the
women
*NL*
of
his
own
family
-RRB-
were
``
different
''
and
``
mysterious
.
''
Yet
he
had
known
*NL*
by
instinct
that
Louetta
Swanson
could
be
approached
.
Her
eyes
and
lips
*NL*
were
moist
.
Her
face
tapered
from
a
broad
forehead
to
a
pointed
chin
,
*NL*
her
mouth
was
thin
but
strong
and
avid
,
and
between
her
brows
were
two
*NL*
outcurving
and
passionate
wrinkles
.
She
was
thirty
,
perhaps
,
or
younger
.
*NL*
Gossip
had
never
touched
her
,
but
every
man
naturally
and
instantly
rose
*NL*
to
flirtatiousness
when
he
spoke
to
her
,
and
every
woman
watched
her
*NL*
with
stilled
blankness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
games
,
sitting
on
the
davenport
,
Babbitt
spoke
to
her
with
the
*NL*
requisite
gallantry
,
that
sonorous
Floral
Heights
gallantry
which
is
not
*NL*
flirtation
but
a
terrified
flight
from
it
:
``
You
're
looking
like
a
new
*NL*
soda-fountain
to
night
,
Louetta
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ole
Eddie
kind
of
on
the
rampage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
get
so
sick
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
you
get
tired
of
hubby
,
you
can
run
off
with
Uncle
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
ran
away
--
Oh
,
well

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
ever
tell
you
your
hands
are
awful
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
down
at
them
,
she
pulled
the
lace
of
her
sleeves
over
*NL*
them
,
but
otherwise
she
did
not
heed
him
.
She
was
lost
in
unexpressed
*NL*
imaginings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
too
languid
this
evening
to
pursue
his
duty
of
being
*NL*
a
captivating
-LRB-
though
strictly
moral
-RRB-
male
.
He
ambled
back
to
the
*NL*
bridge-tables
.
He
was
not
much
thrilled
when
Mrs.
Frink
,
a
small
*NL*
twittering
woman
,
proposed
that
they
``
try
and
do
some
spiritualism
and
*NL*
table-tipping
--
you
know
Chum
can
make
the
spirits
come
--
honest
,
he
just
*NL*
scares
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ladies
of
the
party
had
not
emerged
all
evening
,
but
now
,
as
the
sex
*NL*
given
to
things
of
the
spirit
while
the
men
warred
against
base
things
*NL*
material
,
they
took
command
and
cried
,
``
Oh
,
let
's
!
''
In
the
dimness
*NL*
the
men
were
rather
solemn
and
foolish
,
but
the
goodwives
quivered
and
*NL*
adored
as
they
sat
about
the
table
.
They
laughed
,
``
Now
,
you
be
good
or
*NL*
I
'll
tell
!
''
when
the
men
took
their
hands
in
the
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
tingled
with
a
slight
return
of
interest
in
life
as
Louetta
*NL*
Swanson
's
hand
closed
on
his
with
quiet
firmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
them
hunched
over
,
intent
.
They
startled
as
some
one
drew
a
*NL*
strained
breath
.
In
the
dusty
light
from
the
hall
they
looked
unreal
,
*NL*
they
felt
disembodied
.
Mrs.
Gunch
squeaked
,
and
they
jumped
with
*NL*
unnatural
jocularity
,
but
at
Frink
's
hiss
they
sank
into
subdued
awe
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
incredibly
,
they
heard
a
knocking
.
They
stared
at
Frink
's
*NL*
half-revealed
hands
and
found
them
lying
still
.
They
wriggled
,
and
*NL*
pretended
not
to
be
impressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
spoke
with
gravity
:
``
Is
some
one
there
?
''
A
thud
.
``
Is
one
knock
to
*NL*
be
the
sign
for
`
yes

?
''
A
thud
.
``
And
two
for
`
no

?
''
A
thud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

ladies
and
gentlemen

shall
we
ask

put
us
into

communication

some
great

Frink
*NL*
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Orville
Jones
begged
,
``
Oh

let
's
talk

from

insulted

*NL*

Babbitt
.

Vergil

not
that

actually
read
him
,
of
course

to
come
right
down

hard
facts

*NL*
he
would
n't
stand
one-two-three
if
he
had
to
buckle
down
to
practical
*NL*
literature

turn
out
a
poem
for

Gunch
chuckled
,
but
the
others
felt
that
this
was
*NL*
irreligious
.
And
besides
--
``
probably
it

still

there
did
happen

*NL*
*NL*
A
thud
.
The
spirit
of
Dante
had
come
to
the
parlor
of
George
F.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
it
seemed
,
quite
ready
to
answer
their
questions
.
He
was
``
glad
*NL*
to
be
with
them
,
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
spelled
out
the
messages
by
running
through
the
alphabet
till
the
*NL*
spirit
interpreter
knocked
at
the
right
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Littlefield
asked
,
in
a
learned
tone
,
``
Do
you
like
it
in
the
Paradiso
,
*NL*
Messire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
very
happy
on

glad
that
you
are
*NL*
studying
this
great
truth
of
spiritualism

Dante
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circle
moved
with
an
awed
creaking
of
stays
and
shirt-fronts
.
*NL*
``
Suppose
--
suppose
there
were
something
to
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
a
different
worry
.
``
Suppose
Chum
Frink
was
really
one
of
*NL*
these
spiritualists
!
Chum
had
,
for
a
literary
fellow

always
seemed
to
*NL*
be
a
Regular
Guy
;
he
belonged
to
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
Church
*NL*
and
went
to
the
Boosters
'
lunches
and
liked
cigars
and
motors
and
racy
*NL*
stories
.
But
suppose
that
secretly
--
After
all
,
you
never
could
tell
*NL*
about
these
darn
highbrows
;
and
to
be
an
out-and-out
spiritualist
would
*NL*
be
almost
like
being
a
socialist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
could
long
be
serious
in
the
presence
of
Vergil
Gunch
.
``
Ask
Dant

*NL*
how
Jack
Shakespeare
and

Verg

--
the
guy
they
named
after
me

along

could
get
into

*NL*
he
blared
,
and
instantly
all
was
mirth
.
Mrs.
Jones
shrieked
,
and
Eddie
*NL*
Swanson
desired
to
know
whether
Dante
did
n't
catch
cold
with
nothing
on
*NL*
but
his
wreath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pleased
Dante
made
humble
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Babbitt
--
the
curst
discontent
was
torturing
him
again
,
and
heavily
,
*NL*
in
the
impersonal
darkness
,
he
pondered
,
``
I
do
n't
--
We
're
all
so
flip
and
*NL*
think
we
're
so
smart
.
There
'd
be

A
fellow
like
Dante

I
wish
I
'd
read
*NL*
some
of
his
pieces

I
do
n't
suppose
I
ever
will

now

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
without
explanation
,
the
impression
of
a
slaggy
cliff
and
on
it
,
*NL*
in
silhouette
against
menacing
clouds
,
a
lone
and
austere
figure
.
He
was
*NL*
dismayed
by
a
sudden
contempt
for
his
surest
friends
.
He
grasped
Louetta
*NL*
Swanson
's
hand
,
and
found
the
comfort
of
human
warmth
.
Habit
came
,
a
*NL*
veteran
warrior
;
and
he
shook
himself
.
``
What
the
deuce
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
me
,
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
patted
Louetta
's
hand
,
to
indicate
that
he
had
n't
meant
anything
*NL*
improper
by
squeezing
it
,
and
demanded
of
Frink
,
``
Say
,
see
if
you
can
*NL*
get

some
of

The
lights
were
switched
on
;
the
women
sat
on
the
fronts
of
their
chairs
*NL*
in
that
determined
suspense
whereby
a
wife
indicates
that
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
present
speaker
has
finished
,
she
is
going
to
remark
brightly
to
*NL*
her
husband
,
``
Well
,
dear
,
I
think
per-HAPS
it
's
about
time
for
us
to

be
saying
good-night

''
For
once
Babbitt
did
not
break
out
in
blustering
*NL*
efforts
to
keep
the
party
going
.
He
had
--
there
was
something
he
wished
*NL*
to
think
out
--
But
the
psychical
research
had
started
them
off
again
.
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Why
did
n't
they
go
home
!
Why
did
n't
they
go
home

-RRB-
Though
he
*NL*
was
impressed
by
the
profundity
of
the
statement
,
he
was
only
*NL*
half-enthusiastic
when
Howard
Littlefield
lectured
,
``
The
United
States
*NL*
is
the
only
nation
in
which
the
government
is
a
Moral

a
social
arrangement

''
-LRB-
``
True
--
true

were
n't
they
EVER
going
home

-RRB-
He
*NL*
was
usually
delighted
to
have
an
``
inside
view
''
of
the
momentous
world
of
*NL*
motors
but
to-night
he
scarcely
listened
to
Eddie
Swanson
's
revelation
:
*NL*
``
If
you
want
to
go
above
the
Javelin
class

the
Zeeco
is
a
mighty
good
*NL*
buy

Couple
weeks
ago
,
and
mind
you
,
this
was
a
fair
,
square
test
,
they
*NL*
took
a
Zeeco
stock
touring-car
and
they
slid
up
the
Tonawanda
hill
on
*NL*
high
,
and
fellow
told
me

-LRB-
``
Zeeco

Were
they
planning
to

stay
all

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
They
really
were
going
,
with
a
flutter
of
``
We
did
have
the
best
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
aggressively
friendly
of
all
was
Babbitt
,
yet
as
he
burbled
he
was
*NL*
reflecting
,
``
I
got
through
it
,
but
for
a
while
there
I
did
n't
hardly
*NL*
think
I
'd
last
out
.
''
He
prepared
to
taste
that
most
delicate
pleasure
of
*NL*
the
host
:
making
fun
of
his
guests
in
the
relaxation
of
midnight
.
As
the
*NL*
door
closed
he
yawned
voluptuously
,
chest
out
,
shoulders
wriggling
,
and
*NL*
turned
cynically
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
beaming
.
``
Oh

it
was
nice

was

know

*NL*
minute

Do
n't
you
think
so
?

*NL*
*NL*
He
could
n't
do
it
.
He
could
n't
mock
.
It
would
have
been
like
sneering
at
*NL*
a
happy
child
.
He
lied
ponderously
:
``
You
bet
!
Best
party
this
year
,
by
a
*NL*
long
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

thought

*NL*
``

But
his
voice
was
seeping
away
.
They
stood
in
the
hall
,
under
*NL*
the
electric
light
in
its
square
box-like
shade
of
red
glass
bound
with

nickel

She
stared
at
him

*NL*
``

Then
*NL*
he
was
pouring
it
out
nakedly

robbed
of
reticence

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
do
n't
we
do
it

Verona

Matilda
can
run
the
house
between

them

and
you

I
can
go
any
time

if
you

we
can
afford
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that

--
I
've
been
feeling
so
jumpy
lately
,
I
thought
maybe
it
might
*NL*
be
a
good
thing
if
I
kind
of
got
off
by
myself

sweat
it
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
Do

you
WANT

to
go
along

She
was
too
wretchedly
in
*NL*
earnest
to
be
tragic
,
or
gloriously
insulted
,
or
anything
save
dumpy
and
*NL*
defenseless
and
flushed
to
the
red
steaminess
of
a
boiled
beet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
!
I
just
meant
--
''
Remembering
that
Paul
Riesling
had
*NL*
predicted
this
,
he
was
as
desperate
as
she
.
``
I
mean
,
sometimes
it
's
a
*NL*
good
thing
for
an
old
grouch
like
me
to
go
off

get
it
out
of
*NL*
his
system

''
He
tried
to
sound
paternal
.
``
Then
when
you
and
the
kids
*NL*
arrive

I
figured
maybe
I
might
skip
up
to
Maine
just
a

days
ahead
*NL*
of
you

I

be
ready

bat

He
coaxed
her
*NL*
with
large
booming
sounds
,
with
affable
smiles
,
like
a
popular
preacher
*NL*
blessing
an
Easter
congregation
,
like
a
humorous
lecturer
completing
his
*NL*
stint
of
eloquence
,
like
all
perpetrators
of
masculine
wiles

*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
at
him
,
the
joy
of
festival
drained
from
her
face
.
``
Do
I

*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
.
Suddenly
,
dreadfully
,
he
was
hysterical
,
he
was
a
yelping
*NL*
baby
.
``
Yes

yes

yes

*NL*
It
was
she
who
was
mature
and
protective
now
.
``
Why

go
along

She
patted
his
shoulder
--
reaching
up
to
*NL*
it
--
while
he
shook
with
palsied
helplessness
,
and
in
that
moment
was
not
*NL*
merely
by
habit
fond
of
her
but
clung
to
her
strength

*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
cheerily
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
For
many
minutes
,
for
many
hours
,
for
a
bleak
eternity
,
he
lay
awake
,
*NL*
shivering
,
reduced
to
primitive
terror
,
comprehending
that
he
had
won
*NL*
freedom
,
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
with
anything
so
unknown

so
*NL*
embarrassing
as
freedom

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
No
apartment-house
in
Zenith
had
more
resolutely
experimented
in
*NL*
condensation
than
the
Revelstoke
Arms
,
in
which
Paul
and
Zilla
Riesling
*NL*
had
a
flat
.
By
sliding
the
beds
into
low
closets
the
bedrooms
were
*NL*
converted
into
living-rooms
.
The
kitchens
were
cupboards
each
containing
*NL*
an
electric
range
,
a
copper
sink
,
a
glass
refrigerator
,
and
,
very
*NL*
intermittently
,
a
Balkan
maid
.
Everything
about
the
Arms
was
excessively
*NL*
modern
,
and
everything
was
compressed
--
except
the
garages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Babbitts
were
calling
on
the
Rieslings
at
the
Arms
.
It
was
a
*NL*
speculative
venture
to
call
on
the
Rieslings
;
interesting
and
sometimes
*NL*
disconcerting
.
Zilla
was
an
active
,
strident
,
full-blown
,
high-bosomed
*NL*
blonde
.
When
she
condescended
to
be
good-humored
she
was
nervously
*NL*
amusing
.
Her
comments
on
people
were
saltily
satiric
and
penetrative
of
*NL*
accepted
hypocrisies
.
``
That
's
so
!
''
you
said
,
and
looked
sheepish
.
She
*NL*
danced
wildly
,
and
called
on
the
world
to
be
merry
,
but
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
it
she
would
turn
indignant
.
She
was
always
becoming
indignant
.
Life
was
*NL*
a
plot
against
her
and
she
exposed
it
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
affable
to-night
.
She
merely
hinted
that
Orville
Jones
wore
a
*NL*
toupe
,
that
Mrs.
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
's
singing
resembled
a
Ford
going
*NL*
into
high
,
and
that
the
Hon.
Otis
Deeble
,
mayor
of
Zenith
and
candidate
*NL*
for
Congress
,
was
a
flatulent
fool
-LRB-
which
was
quite
true
-RRB-
.
The
Babbitts
*NL*
and
Rieslings
sat
doubtfully
on
stone-hard
brocade
chairs
in
the
small
*NL*
living-room
of
the
flat
,
with
its
mantel
unprovided
with
a
fireplace
,
*NL*
and
its
strip
of
heavy
gilt
fabric
upon
a
glaring
new
player-piano
,
till
*NL*
Mrs.
Riesling
shrieked
,
``
Come
on
!
Let
's
put
some
pep
in
it
!
Get
out
your
*NL*
fiddle
,
Paul
,
and
I
'll
try
to
make
Georgie
dance
decently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Babbitts
were
in
earnest
.
They
were
plotting
for
the
escape
to
*NL*
Maine
.
But
when
Mrs.
Babbitt
hinted
with
plump
smilingness
,
``
Does
*NL*
Paul
get
as
tired
after
the
winter
's
work
as
Georgie
does
?
''
then
Zilla
*NL*
remembered
an
injury
;
and
when
Zilla
Riesling
remembered
an
injury
the
*NL*
world
stopped
till
something
had
been
done
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
get
tired
?
No
,
he
does
n't
get
tired
,
he
just
goes
crazy
,
that
's
*NL*
all
!
You
think
Paul
is
so
reasonable
,
oh
,
yes
,
and
he
loves
to
make
out
*NL*
he
's
a
little
lamb
,
but
he
's
stubborn
as
a
mule
.
Oh
,
if
you
had
to
live
*NL*
with
him
--
!
You
'd
find
out
how
sweet
he
is
!
He
just
pretends
to
be
*NL*
meek
so
he
can
have
his
own
way
.
And
me
,
I
get
the
credit
for
being
*NL*
a
terrible
old
crank
,
but
if
I
did
n't
blow
up
once
in
a
while
and
get
*NL*
something
started
,
we
'd
die
of
dry-rot
.
He
never
wants
to
go
any
place
*NL*
and
--
Why
,
last
evening
,
just
because
the
car
was
out
of
order
--
and
*NL*
that
was
his
fault
,
too
,
because
he
ought
to
have
taken
it
to
the
*NL*
service-station
and
had
the
battery
looked
at
--
and
he
did
n't
want
to
go
*NL*
down
to
the
movies
on
the
trolley
.
But
we
went
,
and
then
there
was
one
*NL*
of
those
impudent
conductors
,
and
Paul
would
n't
do
a
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
standing
on
the
platform
waiting
for
the
people
to
let
me
into
*NL*
the
car
,
and
this
beast
,
this
conductor
,
hollered
at
me
,
`
Come
on
,
you
,
*NL*
move
up
!
'
Why
,
I
've
never
had
anybody
speak
to
me
that
way
in
all
my
*NL*
life
!
I
was
so
astonished
I
just
turned
to
him
and
said
--
I
thought
there
*NL*
must
be
some
mistake
,
and
so
I
said
to
him
,
perfectly
pleasant
,
`
Were
*NL*
you
speaking
to
me
?
'
and
he
went
on
and
bellowed
at
me
,
`
Yes
,
I
was
!
*NL*
You
're
keeping
the
whole
car
from
starting
!
'
he
said
,
and
then
I
saw
he
*NL*
was
one
of
these
dirty
ill-bred
hogs
that
kindness
is
wasted
on
,
and
so
*NL*
I
stopped
and
looked
right
at
him
,
and
I
said
,
`
I
--
beg
--
your
--
pardon
,
*NL*
I
am
not
doing
anything
of
the
kind
,
'
I
said
,
`
it
's
the
people
ahead
of
*NL*
me
,
who
wo
n't
move
up
,
'
I
said
,
`
and
furthermore
,
let
me
tell
you
,
young
*NL*
man
,
that
you
're
a
low-down
,
foul-mouthed
,
impertinent
skunk
,
'
I
said
,
*NL*
`
and
you
're
no
gentleman
!
I
certainly
intend
to
report
you
,
and
we
'll
*NL*
see
,
'
I
said
,
`
whether
a
lady
is
to
be
insulted
by
any
drunken
bum
that
*NL*
chooses
to
put
on
a
ragged
uniform
,
and
I
'd
thank
you
,
'
I
said
,
`
to
keep
*NL*
your
filthy
abuse
to
yourself
.
'
And
then
I
waited
for
Paul
to
show
*NL*
he
was
half
a
man
and
come
to
my
defense
,
and
he
just
stood
there
*NL*
and
pretended
he
had
n't
heard
a
word
,
and
so
I
said
to
him
,
`
Well
,
'
I
*NL*
said
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
cut
it
,
cut
it
,
Zill
!
''
Paul
groaned
.
``
We
all
know
I
'm
a
*NL*
mollycoddle
,
and
you
're
a
tender
bud
,
and
let
's
let
it
go
at
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
go
?
''
Zilla
's
face
was
wrinkled
like
the
Medusa
,
her
voice
was
a
*NL*
dagger
of
corroded
brass
.
She
was
full
of
the
joy
of
righteousness
and
*NL*
bad
temper
.
She
was
a
crusader
and
,
like
every
crusader
,
she
exulted
*NL*
in
the
opportunity
to
be
vicious
in
the
name
of
virtue
.
``
Let
it
go
?
If
*NL*
people
knew
how
many
things
I
've
let
go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quit
being
such
a
bully

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
a
fine
figure
you
'd
cut

I
did
n't
bully
you

You
'd
lie
abed
till
*NL*
noon
and
play
your
idiotic
fiddle
till
midnight

You
're
born
lazy

*NL*
you

born
shiftless

Riesling

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
,
do
n't
say
that

Zilla

you
do
n't

protested
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
say

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
,
Zilla
,
the
idea
!
''
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
maternal
and
fussy
.
She
*NL*
was
no
older
than
Zilla
,
but
she
seemed
so
--
at
first
.
She
was
placid
*NL*
and
puffy
and
mature
,
where
Zilla
,
at
forty-five
,
was
so
bleached
and
*NL*
tight-corseted
that
you
knew
only
that
she
was
older
than
she
looked
.
*NL*
``
The
idea
of
talking
to
poor
Paul
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Paul
is
right

We
'd
both
be
poor

we
'd
be
in
the
poorhouse

*NL*
did
n't
jazz
him
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
now
,
Zilla
,
Georgie
and
I
were
just
saying
how
hard
Paul
's
been
*NL*
working
all
year
,
and
we
were
thinking
it
would
be
lovely
if
the
Boys
*NL*
could
run
off
by
themselves
.
I
've
been
coaxing
George
to
go
up
to
Maine
*NL*
ahead
of
the
rest
of
us
,
and
get
the
tired
out
of
his
system
before
we
*NL*
come
,
and
I
think
it
would
be
lovely
if
Paul
could
manage
to
get
away
*NL*
and
join
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
exposure
of
his
plot
to
escape
,
Paul
was
startled
out
of
*NL*
impassivity
.
He
rubbed
his
fingers
.
His
hands
twitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zilla
bayed
,
``
Yes
!
You
're
lucky
!
You
can
let
George
go

and
not
have

watch
him

Fat
old
Georgie

Never
peeps
at

spunk

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hell

''
Babbitt
was
fervently
defending
his
priceless
*NL*
immorality
when
Paul
interrupted
him
--
and
Paul
looked
dangerous
.
He
rose
*NL*
quickly
;
he
said
gently
to
Zilla
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
imply
I
have
a
lot
of
sweethearts

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

then

my

since
you
ask
for
it

There
has

been
a

the
last
ten
years
when
I
have
n't
found
some
nice
little
girl
to
*NL*
comfort
me
,
and
as
long
as
you
continue
your
amiability
I
shall
probably
*NL*
continue
to
deceive
you

It
is

hard

You
're
so
stupid

*NL*
*NL*
Zilla
gibbered
;
she
howled
;
words
could
not
be
distinguished
in
her
*NL*
slaver
of
abuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
bland
George
F.
Babbitt
was
transformed
.
If
Paul
was
dangerous
,
*NL*
if
Zilla
was
a
snake-locked
fury
,
if
the
neat
emotions
suitable
to
the
*NL*
Revelstoke
Arms
had
been
slashed
into
raw
hatreds
,
it
was
Babbitt
who
*NL*
was
the
most
formidable
.
He
leaped
up
.
He
seemed
very
large
.
He
seized
*NL*
Zilla
's
shoulder
.
The
cautions
of
the
broker
were
wiped
from
his
face
,
*NL*
and
his
voice
was
cruel
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
enough
of
all
this
damn
nonsense

I
've
known
you

I
never

miss
a

your

out
on

You
're
not
wicked

You
're
worse

*NL*
You
're
a
fool

And
let
me
tell
you
that
Paul
is
the
finest
boy
God
ever
*NL*
made

Every
decent
person
is
sick

tired
of
your
taking
advantage

springing
every

innuendo
you
can
think
of

*NL*
Who
the

are
you
that
a
person
like
Paul
should
have
to
ask
your
*NL*
PERMISSION
to
go
with

act

sobbing

talked
to
me
*NL*
like
this
in
all
my
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
that
's
the
way
they
talk
behind
your
back
!
Always
!
They
say
*NL*
you
're
a
scolding
old
woman
.
Old
,
by
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
cowardly
attack
broke
her
.
Her
eyes
were
blank
.
She
wept
.
But
*NL*
Babbitt
glared
stolidly
.
He
felt
that
he
was
the
all-powerful
official
*NL*
in
charge
;
that
Paul
and
Mrs.
Babbitt
looked
on
him
with
awe
;
that
he
*NL*
alone
could
handle
this
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zilla
writhed
.
She
begged
,
``
Oh
,
they
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
certainly
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
a
bad
woman

I
'm
terribly
sorry

I
'll
kill
myself
!
I
'll
do
*NL*
anything
.
Oh
,
I
'll
--
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
abased
herself
completely
.
Also
,
she
enjoyed
it
.
To
the
connoisseur
*NL*
of
scenes
,
nothing
is
more
enjoyable
than
a
thorough
,
melodramatic
,
*NL*
egoistic
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
let
Paul
beat
it
off
to
Maine
with
me
,
''
Babbitt
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
help
his
going
?
You
've
just
said
I
was
an
idiot
and
nobody
*NL*
paid
any
attention
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
can
help
it
,
all
right
,
all
right
!
What
you
got
to
do
is
to
cut
*NL*
out
hinting
that
the
minute
he
gets
out
of
your
sight
,
he
'll
go
chasing
*NL*
after
some
petticoat
.
Matter
fact
,
that
's
the
way
you
start
the
boy
off
*NL*
wrong
.
You
ought
to
have
more
sense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
will
,
honestly
,
I
will

George
.
I
know
I
was
bad

Oh
,
forgive
me
,
*NL*
all
of
you
,
forgive
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
enjoyed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
did
Babbitt
.
He
condemned
magnificently
and
forgave
piously
,
and
as
*NL*
he
went
parading
out
with
his
wife
he
was
grandly
explanatory
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kind
of
a
shame
to
bully
Zilla
,
but
course
it
was
the
only
way
to
*NL*
handle
her
.
Gosh
,
I
certainly
did
have
her
crawling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
calmly
,
``
Yes
.
You
were
horrid
.
You
were
showing
off
.
You
were
*NL*
having
a
lovely
time
thinking
what
a
great
fine
person
you
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
by
golly
!
Can
you
beat
it
!
Of
course
I
might
of
expected
you
to
*NL*
not
stand
by
me
!
I
might
of
expected
you
'd
stick
up
for
your
own
sex
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Poor
Zilla
,
she
's
so
unhappy
.
She
takes
it
out
on
Paul
.
She
has
n't
*NL*
a
single
thing
to
do
,
in
that
little
flat
.
And
she
broods
too
much
.
And
*NL*
she
used
to
be
so
pretty
and
gay
,
and
she
resents
losing
it
.
And
you
*NL*
were
just
as
nasty
and
mean
as
you
could
be
.
I
'm
not
a
bit
proud
of
*NL*
you
--
or
of
Paul
,
boasting
about
his
horrid
love-affairs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sulkily
silent
;
he
maintained
his
bad
temper
at
a
high
level
of
*NL*
outraged
nobility
all
the
four
blocks
home
.
At
the
door
he
left
her
,
in
*NL*
self-approving
haughtiness
,
and
tramped
the
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
shock
it
was
revealed
to
him
:
``
Gosh
,
I
wonder
if
she
was
*NL*
right
--
if
she
was
partly
right
?
''
Overwork
must
have
flayed
him
to
*NL*
abnormal
sensitiveness
;
it
was
one
of
the
few
times
in
his
life
when
he
*NL*
had
queried
his
eternal
excellence
;
and
he
perceived
the
summer
night
,
*NL*
smelled
the
wet
grass
.
Then
:
``
I
do
n't
care
!
I
've
pulled
it
off
.
We
're
*NL*
going
to
have
our
spree
.
And
for
Paul
,
I
'd
do
anything
.

They
were
buying
their
Maine
tackle
at
Ijams
Brothers
'
,
the
Sporting
*NL*
Goods
Mart
,
with
the
help
of
Willis
Ijams
,
fellow
member
of
the
*NL*
Boosters
'
Club
.
Babbitt
was
completely
mad
.
He
trumpeted
and
danced
.
He
*NL*
muttered
to
Paul
,
``
Say
,
this
is
pretty
good
,
eh
?
To
be
buying
the
stuff
,
*NL*
eh

And
good
old
Willis
Ijams
himself
coming
down
on
the
floor
to
wait
*NL*
on
us
!
Say
,
if
those
fellows
that
are
getting
their
kit
for
the
North
*NL*
Lakes
knew
we
were
going
clear
up
to

they
'd
have
a

*NL*
Well

come
on

Brother
Ijams

Willis

I

Here
's
your

We
're

a

Let
me
at
it

I
'm
going

buy
out
the
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
He
gloated
on
fly-rods
and
gorgeous
rubber
hip-boots
,
on
tents
with
*NL*
celluloid
windows
and
folding
chairs
and
ice-boxes
.
He
simple-heartedly
*NL*
wanted
to
buy
all
of
them
.
It
was
the
Paul
whom
he
was
always
vaguely
*NL*
protecting
who
kept
him
from
his
drunken
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
Paul
lightened
when
Willis
Ijams
,
a
salesman
with
poetry
and
*NL*
diplomacy
,
discussed
flies
.
``
Now
,
of
course
,
you
boys
know
.
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
the
great
scrap
is
between
dry
flies

wet

Personally

I
'm
for

dry

More
sporting

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so

Lots
more

fulminated
Babbitt
,
who
knew
very
*NL*
little
about
flies
either
wet
or
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
if
you
'll
take
my
advice

you
'll
stock
up
well

there
's

Babbitt

asserted
Babbitt

his
thick

made
a
rapturous
motion
of
casting
.

never

*NL*
They
were
on
the
New
York
express
,
incredibly
bound
for
Maine
,
*NL*
incredibly
without
their
families
.
They
were
free
,
in
a
man
's
world
,
in
*NL*
the
smoking-compartment
of
the
Pullman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
car
window
was
a
glaze
of
darkness
stippled
with
the
gold
*NL*
of
infrequent
mysterious
lights
.
Babbitt
was
immensely
conscious
,
in
*NL*
the
sway
and
authoritative
clatter
of
the
train
,
of
going
,
of
going
on
.
*NL*
Leaning
toward
Paul
he
grunted
,
``
Gosh
,
pretty
nice
to
be
hiking
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
room
,
with
its
walls
of
ocher-colored
steel
,
was
filled
mostly
*NL*
with
the
sort
of
men
he
classified
as
the
Best
Fellows
You
'll
Ever
*NL*
Meet
--
Real
Good
Mixers
.
There
were
four
of
them
on
the
long
seat
;
a
fat
*NL*
man
with
a
shrewd
fat
face
,
a
knife-edged
man
in
a
green
velour
hat
,
*NL*
a
very
young
young
man
with
an
imitation
amber
cigarette-holder
,
and
*NL*
Babbitt
.
Facing
them
,
on
two
movable
leather
chairs
,
were
Paul
and
a
*NL*
lanky
,
old-fashioned
man
,
very
cunning
,
with
wrinkles
bracketing
*NL*
his
mouth
.
They
all
read
newspapers
or
trade
journals
,
boot-and-shoe
*NL*
journals
,
crockery
journals
,
and
waited
for
the
joys
of
conversation
.
*NL*
It
was
the
very
young
man
,
now
making
his
first
journey
by
Pullman
,
who
*NL*
began
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
gee
,
I
had
a
wild
old
time
in
Zenith
!
''
he
gloried
.
``
Say
,
if
a
*NL*
fellow
knows
the
ropes
there
he
can
have
as
wild
a
time
as
he
can
in
New
*NL*
York
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yuh
,
I
bet
you
simply
raised
the
old
Ned
.
I
figured
you
were
a
bad
man
*NL*
when
I
saw
you
get
on
the
train
!
''
chuckled
the
fat
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
delightedly
laid
down
their
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
right
now
!
I
guess
I
seen
some
things
in
the
Arbor
you
*NL*
never
seen
!
''
complained
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
bet
you
did
!
I
bet
you
lapped
up
the
malted
milk
like
a
*NL*
reg
`
lar
little
devil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
the
boy
having
served
as
introduction
,
they
ignored
him
and
*NL*
charged
into
real
talk
.
Only
Paul
,
sitting
by
himself
,
reading
at
a
*NL*
serial
story
in
a
newspaper
,
failed
to
join
them
and
all
but
Babbitt
*NL*
regarded
him
as
a
snob
,
an
eccentric
,
a
person
of
no
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
of
them
said
which
has
never
been
determined
,
and
does
not
matter
,
*NL*
since
they
all
had
the
same
ideas
and
expressed
them
always
with
the
*NL*
same
ponderous
and
brassy
assurance
.
If
it
was
not
Babbitt
who
was
*NL*
delivering
any
given
verdict
,
at
least
he
was
beaming
on
the
chancellor
*NL*
who
did
deliver
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
that
,
though
,
''
announced
the
first
``
they
're
selling
quite
some
booze
*NL*
in
Zenith
.
Guess
they
are
everywhere
.
I
do
n't
know
how
you
fellows
*NL*
feel
about
prohibition
,
but
the
way
it
strikes
me
is
that
it
's
a
mighty
*NL*
beneficial
thing
for
the
poor
zob
that
has
n't
got
any
will-power
but
for
*NL*
fellows
like
us
,
it
's
an
infringement
of
personal
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fact
.
Congress
has
got
no
right
to
interfere
with
a
fellow

*NL*
personal
liberty

''
contended
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
came
in
from
the
car
,
but
as
all
the
seats
were
full
he
stood
up
*NL*
while
he
smoked
his
cigarette
.
He
was
an
Outsider
;
he
was
not
one
of
the
*NL*
Old
Families
of
the
smoking-compartment
.
They
looked
upon
him
bleakly
*NL*
and
,
after
trying
to
appear
at
ease
by
examining
his
chin
in
the
mirror
,
*NL*
he
gave
it
up
and
went
out
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
been
making
a
trip
through
the
South
.
Business
conditions
not
very
*NL*
good
down
there

said
one
of
the
council
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a

Not
very
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

strike
me

were
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
would
n't
hardly
say

were

*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
council
nodded
sagely
and
decided
,
``
Yump
,
not
hardly
up
to
*NL*
snuff

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

do

Saaaay

You

I
'd
sold
him
a

asked
him
to
work
on

He
hands
me
the

I

*NL*
I
'll
see

and
he
ducks
behind
the
rigamajig
they
keep
track
of
the
*NL*
rooms
on

Well
,
I
guess
he
called
up
the
Credit
Association
and
the
*NL*
American
Security
League
to
see
if
I
was
all
right
--
he
certainly
took
*NL*
long
enough
--
or
maybe
he
just
went
to
sleep
;
but
finally
he
comes
out
*NL*
and
looks
at
me
like
it
hurts
him
,
and
croaks
,
'
I
think
I
can
let
*NL*
you
have
a
room
with
bath

'
`
Well

that
's
awful
nice
of
you

sorry
to
*NL*
trouble
you

how
much
'll
it
set
me
back
?

I
says
,
real
sweet

`
It
'll
*NL*
cost
you
seven

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it
was

I

*NL*
*NL*
They
voted
that

the

sold
collars

then
the

price
of
collars
was
exactly
what
it

be

all

*NL*
was
tragically
too
expensive

They
admired

loved
one
another

They
went
profoundly
into
the

indicated
that

the
purpose

manufacturing
a

a

was
so
that

be

had
an

on

The
shop-talk
roused
Paul
Riesling
.
Though
he
was
a
player
of
violins
*NL*
and
an
interestingly
unhappy
husband
,
he
was
also
a
very
able
salesman
*NL*
of
tar-roofing
.
He
listened
to
the
fat

remarks
on
``
the
value

house-organs

bulletins
as
a
method

and
he
himself
offered
one
or
two
excellent
thoughts
on
the
use
*NL*
of
two-cent

on

Then
he
committed
an

They
were
entering

On

passed
a

flared
in

flame
that
licked
at
the
cadaverous

at

in

sulkily
returned

moved
on

entered

in
white
jacket
with
brass
buttons

``

the

porter
,
folding
towels
and
deftly
tossing
them
up
on

rack
above
the
*NL*
washbowls

The
council
stared
at
him
gloomily
and
when
he
was
gone
they
*NL*
wailed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
``

``

another
thing
we
got

said
the
man
with
the
*NL*
velour
hat

was

``
You

That

observed

and
passed
on
to
lighter

topics

They
rapidly
reviewed
motor-car
prices

tire-mileage

*NL*
oil-stocks
,
fishing
,
and
the
prospects
for
the
wheat-crop
in
Dakota

But
the
fat
man
was
impatient
at
this
waste
of
time

He
was
a
veteran
*NL*
traveler
and
free
of
illusions
.
Already
he
had
asserted
that
he
was
*NL*
``
an
old
he-one

''
He
leaned
forward
,
gathered
in
their
attention
by
his
*NL*
expression
of
sly
humor
,
and
grumbled
,
``
Oh

let
's
cut
out
*NL*
the
formality
and
get
down
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
They
became
very
lively
and
intimate

*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
the
boy
vanished

The
others
slid
forward
on
the
long
seat
,
*NL*
unbuttoned
their
vests
,
thrust
their
feet
up
on
the
chairs
,
pulled
the
*NL*
stately
brass
cuspidors
nearer
,
and
ran
the
green
window-shade
down
on
*NL*
its
little
trolley
,
to
shut
them
in
from
the
uncomfortable
strangeness
*NL*
of
night
.
After
each
bark
of
laughter
they
cried
,
``
Say
,
jever
hear
the
*NL*
one
about

Babbitt
was
expansive
and
virile
.
When
the
train
stopped
*NL*
at
an
important
station
,
the
four
men
walked
up
and
down
the
cement
*NL*
platform
,
under
the
vast
smoky
train-shed
roof
,
like
a
stormy
sky
,
under
*NL*
the
elevated
footways
,
beside
crates
of
ducks
and
sides
of
beef
,
in
the
*NL*
mystery
of
an
unknown
city
.
They
strolled
abreast
,
old
friends
and
well
*NL*
content
.
At
the
long-drawn
``
Alllll
aboarrrrrd
''
--
like
a
mountain
call
at
*NL*
dusk
--
they
hastened
back
into
the
smoking-compartment
,
and
till
two
of
*NL*
the
morning
continued
the
droll
tales
,
their
eyes
damp
with
cigar-smoke
*NL*
and
laughter
.
When
they
parted
they
shook
hands
,
and
chuckled
,
``
Well

it

Babbitt
lay
awake
in

close
hot
tomb

berth

shaking
*NL*
with
remembrance
of
the
fat
man
's
limerick
about
the
lady
who
wished
to
*NL*
be
wild
.
He
raised
the
shade
;
he
lay
with
a
puffy
arm
tucked
between
his
*NL*
head
and
the
skimpy
pillow
,
looking
out
on
the
sliding
silhouettes
of

trees

village
lamps

wished

was
the
Pennsylvania

which
had
been
built
since
his

He
stared
up
at
it

muttering
,
``
Twenty-two
hundred
rooms

That
's
got

I

some

hundred-say
six
times
twenty-two

well
,
anyway
,
with

and
everything
,
say
summers
between
eight
and
fifteen
thousand
a
day
.
*NL*
Every
day
!
I
never
thought
I
'd
see
a
thing
like
that
!
Some
town
!
Of
*NL*
course
the
average
fellow
in
Zenith
has
got
more
Individual
Initiative
*NL*
than
the
fourflushers
here
,
but
I
got
to
hand
it
to
New
York
.
Yes
,
sir
,
*NL*
town
,
you
're
all
right
--
some
ways
.
Well
,
old
Paulski
,
I
guess
we
've
*NL*
seen
everything
that
's
worth
while
.
How
'll
we
kill
the
rest
of
the
time
?
*NL*
Movie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Paul
desired
to
see
a
liner
.
``
Always
wanted
to
go
to
Europe
--
and
,
by
*NL*
thunder
,
I
will
,
too
,
some
day
before
I
past
out
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
rough
wharf
on
the
North
River
they
stared
at
the
stern
of
*NL*
the
Aquitania
and
her
stacks
and
wireless
antenna
lifted
above
the
*NL*
dock-house
which
shut
her
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
golly
,
''
Babbitt
droned
,
``
would
n't
be
so
bad
to
go
over
to
the
*NL*
Old
Country
and
take
a
squint
at
all
these
ruins
,
and
the
place
where
*NL*
Shakespeare
was
born
.
And
think
of
being
able
to
order
a
drink
whenever
*NL*
you
wanted
one
!
Just
range
up
to
a
bar
and
holler
out
loud
,
`
Gim
me
a
*NL*
cocktail
,
and
darn
the
police
!
'
Not
bad
at
all
.
What
juh
like
to
see
,
*NL*
over
there
,
Paulibus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
did
not
answer
.
Babbitt
turned
.
Paul
was
standing
with
clenched
*NL*
fists
,
head
drooping
,
staring
at
the
liner
as
in
terror
.
His
thin
body
,
*NL*
seen
against
the
summer-glaring
planks
of
the
wharf
,
was
childishly
*NL*
meager
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
``
What
would
you
hit
for
on
the
other
side
,
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Scowling
at
the
steamer
,
his
breast
heaving
,
Paul
whispered
,
``
Oh
,
my
*NL*
God
!
''
While
Babbitt
watched
him
anxiously
he
snapped
,
``
Come
on
,
let
's
*NL*
get
out
of
this
,
''
and
hastened
down
the
wharf
,
not
looking
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
funny
,
''
considered
Babbitt
.
``
The
boy
did
n't
care
for
seeing
the
*NL*
ocean
boats
after
all
.
I
thought
he
'd
be
interested
in
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
exulted
,
and
made
sage
speculations
about
locomotive
*NL*
horse-power
,
as
their
train
climbed
the
Maine
mountain-ridge
and
from
*NL*
the
summit
he
looked
down
the
shining
way
among
the
pines
;
though
he
*NL*
remarked
,
``
Well
,
by
golly
!
''
when
he
discovered
that
the
station
at
*NL*
Katadumcook
,
the
end
of
the
line
,
was
an
aged
freight-car
;
Babbitt
's
*NL*
moment
of
impassioned
release
came
when
they
sat
on
a
tiny
wharf
on
Lake
*NL*
Sunasquam
,
awaiting
the
launch
from
the
hotel
.
A
raft
had
floated
down
*NL*
the
lake
;
between
the
logs
and
the
shore
,
the
water
was
transparent
,
*NL*
thin-looking
,
flashing
with
minnows
.
A
guide
in
black
felt
hat
with
*NL*
trout-flies
in
the
band
,
and
flannel
shirt
of
a
peculiarly
daring
blue
,
*NL*
sat
on
a
log
and
whittled
and
was
silent
.
A
dog
,
a
good
country
*NL*
dog
,
black
and
woolly
gray
,
a
dog
rich
in
leisure
and
in
meditation
,
*NL*
scratched
and
grunted
and
slept
.
The
thick
sunlight
was
lavish
on
the
*NL*
bright
water
,
on
the
rim
of
gold-green
balsam
boughs
,
the
silver
birches
*NL*
and
tropic
ferns
,
and
across
the
lake
it
burned
on
the
sturdy
shoulders
*NL*
of
the
mountains
.
Over
everything
was
a
holy
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silent
,
they
loafed
on
the
edge
of
the
wharf
,
swinging
their
legs
above
*NL*
the
water
.
The
immense
tenderness
of
the
place
sank
into
Babbitt
,
and
*NL*
he
murmured
,
``
I
'd
just
like
to
sit
here
--
the
rest
of
my
life
--
and
*NL*
whittle
--
and
sit
.
And
never
hear
a
typewriter
.
Or
Stan
Graff
fussing
in
*NL*
the
`
phone
.
Or
Rone
and
Ted
scrapping
.
Just
sit
.
Gosh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
patted
Paul
's
shoulder
.
``
How
does
it
strike
you
,
old
snoozer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
darn
good
,
Georgie
.
There
's
something
sort
of
eternal
about
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
,
Babbitt
understood
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
Their
launch
rounded
the
bend
;
at
the
head
of
the
lake
,
under
a
mountain
*NL*
slope
,
they
saw
the
little
central
dining-shack
of
their
hotel
and
the
*NL*
crescent
of
squat
log
cottages
which
served
as
bedrooms
.
They
landed
,
*NL*
and
endured
the
critical
examination
of
the
habitues
who
had
been
at
the
*NL*
hotel
for
a
whole
week
.
In
their
cottage
,
with
its
high
stone
fireplace
,
*NL*
they
hastened
,
as
Babbitt
expressed
it
,
to
``
get
into
some
regular
*NL*
he-togs
.
''
They
came
out
;
Paul
in
an
old
gray
suit
and
soft
white
shirt
;
*NL*
Babbitt
in
khaki
shirt
and
vast
and
flapping
khaki
trousers
.
It
was
*NL*
excessively
new
khaki
;
his
rimless
spectacles
belonged
to
a
city
office
;
*NL*
and
his
face
was
not
tanned
but
a
city
pink
.
He
made
a
discordant
noise
*NL*
in
the
place
.
But
with
infinite
satisfaction
he
slapped
his
legs
and
*NL*
crowed
,
``
Say
,
this
is
getting
back
home
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
on
the
wharf
before
the
hotel
.
He
winked
at
Paul
and
drew
*NL*
from
his
back
pocket
a
plug
of
chewing-tobacco
,
a
vulgarism
forbidden
*NL*
in
the
Babbitt
home
.
He
took
a
chew
,
beaming
and
wagging
his
head
as
*NL*
he
tugged
at
it
.
``
Um
!
Um
!
Maybe
I
have
n't
been
hungry
for
a
wad
of
*NL*
eating-tobacco
!
Have
some
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
in
a
grin
of
understanding
.
Paul
took
the
*NL*
plug
,
gnawed
at
it
.
They
stood
quiet
,
their
jaws
working
.
They
solemnly
*NL*
spat
,
one
after
the
other
,
into
the
placid
water
.
They
stretched
*NL*
voluptuously
,
with
lifted
arms
and
arched
backs
.
From
beyond
the
*NL*
mountains
came
the
shuffling
sound
of
a
far-off
train
.
A
trout
leaped
,
*NL*
and
fell
back
in
a
silver
circle
.
They
sighed
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
week
before
their
families
came
.
Each
evening
they
planned
to
*NL*
get
up
early
and
fish
before
breakfast
.
Each
morning
they
lay
abed
till
*NL*
the
breakfast-bell
,
pleasantly
conscious
that
there
were
no
efficient
*NL*
wives
to
rouse
them
.
The
mornings
were
cold
;
the
fire
was
kindly
as
they
*NL*
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
distressingly
clean
,
but
Babbitt
reveled
in
a
good
sound
*NL*
dirtiness
,
in
not
having
to
shave
till
his
spirit
was
moved
to
it
.
He
*NL*
treasured
every
grease
spot
and
fish-scale
on
his
new
khaki
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
morning
they
fished
unenergetically
,
or
tramped
the
dim
and
*NL*
aqueous-lighted
trails
among
rank
ferns
and
moss
sprinkled
with
crimson
*NL*
bells
.
They
slept
all
afternoon
,
and
till
midnight
played
stud-poker
*NL*
with
the
guides
.
Poker
was
a
serious
business
to
the
guides
.
They
did
*NL*
not
gossip
;
they
shuffled
the
thick
greasy
cards
with
a
deft
ferocity
*NL*
menacing
to
the
``
sports
;
''
and
Joe
Paradise
,
king
of
guides
,
was
*NL*
sarcastic
to
loiterers
who
halted
the
game
even
to
scratch
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
,
as
Paul
and
he
blundered
to
their
cottage
over
the
pungent
*NL*
wet
grass
,
and
pine-roots
confusing
in
the
darkness
,
Babbitt
rejoiced
*NL*
that
he
did
not
have
to
explain
to
his
wife
where
he
had
been
all
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
talk
much
.
The
nervous
loquacity
and
opinionation
of
the
*NL*
Zenith
Athletic
Club
dropped
from
them
.
But
when
they
did
talk
they
*NL*
slipped
into
the
naive
intimacy
of
college
days
.
Once
they
drew
their
*NL*
canoe
up
to
the
bank
of
Sunasquam
Water
,
a
stream
walled
in
by
the
dense
*NL*
green
of
the
hardhack
.
The
sun
roared
on
the
green
jungle
but
in
the
*NL*
shade
was
sleepy
peace
,
and
the
water
was
golden
and
rippling
.
Babbitt
*NL*
drew
his
hand
through
the
cool
flood
,
and
mused
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
never
thought
we
'd
come
to
Maine
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
We
've
never
done
anything
the
way
we
thought
we
would
.
I
expected
*NL*
to
live
in
Germany
with
my
granddad
's
people
,
and
study
the
fiddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
.
And
remember
how
I
wanted
to
be
a
lawyer
and
go
into
*NL*
politics
?
I
still
think
I
might
have
made
a
go
of
it
.
I
've
kind
of
got
*NL*
the
gift
of
the
gab
--
anyway
,
I
can
think
on
my
feet
,
and
make
some
kind
*NL*
of
a
spiel
on
most
anything
,
and
of
course
that
's
the
thing
you
need
in
*NL*
politics
.
By
golly
,
Ted
's
going
to
law-school
,
even
if
I
did
n't
!
Well
--
I
*NL*
guess
it
's
worked
out
all
right
.
Myra
's
been
a
fine
wife

And
Zilla
*NL*
means
well
,
Paulibus

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Up
here
,
I
figure
out
all
sorts
of
plans
to
keep
her
amused

I
*NL*
kind
of
feel
life
is
going
to
be
different
,
now
that
we
're
getting
a
*NL*
good
rest
and
can
go
back
and
start
over
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
old
boy
.
''
Shyly
:
``
Say
,
gosh
,
it
's
been
awful
nice
to
sit
*NL*
around
and
loaf
and
gamble
and
act
regular
,
with
you
along
,
you
old
*NL*
horse-thief

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
it
means
to
me
,
Georgie
.
Saved
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
shame
of
emotion
overpowered
them
;
they
cursed
a
little
,
to
prove
*NL*
they
were
good
rough
fellows
;
and
in
a
mellow
silence
,
Babbitt
whistling
*NL*
while
Paul
hummed
,
they
paddled
back
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
Paul
who
had
seemed
overwrought
,
Babbitt
who
had
been
the
*NL*
protecting
big
brother
,
Paul
became
clear-eyed
and
merry
,
while
Babbitt
*NL*
sank
into
irritability
.
He
uncovered
layer
on
layer
of
hidden
weariness
.
*NL*
At
first
he
had
played
nimble
jester
to
Paul
and
for
him
sought
*NL*
amusements
;
by
the
end
of
the
week
Paul
was
nurse
,
and
Babbitt
accepted
*NL*
favors
with
the
condescension
one
always
shows
a
patient
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
before
their
families
arrived
,
the
women
guests
at
the
*NL*
hotel
bubbled
,
``
Oh
,
is
n't
it
nice
!
You
must
be
so
excited
;
''
and
the
*NL*
proprieties
compelled
Babbitt
and
Paul
to
look
excited
.
But
they
went
to
*NL*
bed
early
and
grumpy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Myra
appeared
she
said
at
once
,
``
Now
,
we
want
you
boys
to
go
on
*NL*
playing
around
just
as
if
we
were
n't
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
evening
,
he
stayed
out
for
poker
with
the
guides
,
and
she
said
*NL*
in
placid
merriment
,
``
My
!
You
're
a
regular
bad
one
!
''
The
second
evening
,
*NL*
she
groaned
sleepily
,
``
Good
heavens
,
are
you
going
to
be
out
every
*NL*
single
night
?
''
The
third
evening
,
he
did
n't
play
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
tired
now
in
every
cell
.
``
Funny
!
Vacation
does
n't
seem
to
have
*NL*
done
me
a
bit
of
good
,
''
he
lamented
.
``
Paul
's
frisky
as
a
colt
,
but
I
*NL*
swear
,
I
'm
crankier
and
nervouser
than
when
I
came
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
three
weeks
of
Maine
.
At
the
end
of
the
second
week
he
began
to
*NL*
feel
calm
,
and
interested
in
life
.
He
planned
an
expedition
to
climb
*NL*
Sachem
Mountain
,
and
wanted
to
camp
overnight
at
Box
Car
Pond
.
He
was
*NL*
curiously
weak
,
yet
cheerful
,
as
though
he
had
cleansed
his
veins
of
*NL*
poisonous
energy
and
was
filling
them
with
wholesome
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
to
be
irritated
by
Ted
's
infatuation
with
a
waitress
-LRB-
his
*NL*
seventh
tragic
affair
this
year
-RRB-
;
he
played
catch
with
Ted
,
and
with
*NL*
pride
taught
him
to
cast
a
fly
in
the
pine-shadowed
silence
of
Skowtuit
*NL*
Pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
he
sighed
,
``
Hang
it
,
I
'm
just
beginning
to
enjoy
my
vacation
.
*NL*
But
,
well
,
I
feel
a
lot
better
.
And
it
's
going
to
be
one
great
year
!
*NL*
Maybe
the
Real
Estate
Board
will
elect
me
president
,
instead
of
some
*NL*
fuzzy
old-fashioned
faker
like
Chan
Mott
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
home
,
whenever
he
went
into
the
smoking-compartment
he
felt
*NL*
guilty
at
deserting
his
wife
and
angry
at
being
expected
to
feel
guilty
,
*NL*
but
each
time
he
triumphed
,
``
Oh

this
is
going
to
be

great
old

*NL*
ALL
the
way
home
from
Maine
,
Babbitt
was
certain
that
he
was
a
changed
*NL*
man
.
He
was
converted
to
serenity
.
He
was
going
to
cease
worrying
*NL*
about
business
.
He
was
going
to
have
more
``
interests
''
--
theaters
,
public
*NL*
affairs
,
reading
.
And
suddenly
,
as
he
finished
an
especially
heavy
*NL*
cigar
,
he
was
going
to
stop
smoking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
invented
a
new
and
perfect
method
.
He
would
buy
no
tobacco
;
he
would
*NL*
depend
on
borrowing
it
;
and
,
of
course
,
he
would
be
ashamed
to
borrow
*NL*
often
.
In
a
spasm
of
righteousness
he
flung
his
cigar-case
out
of
the
*NL*
smoking-compartment
window
.
He
went
back
and
was
kind
to
his
wife
*NL*
about
nothing
in
particular
;
he
admired
his
own
purity
,
and
decided
,
*NL*
``
Absolutely
simple
.
Just
a
matter
of
will-power
.
''
He
started
a
magazine
*NL*
serial
about
a
scientific
detective
.
Ten
miles
on
,
he
was
conscious
that
*NL*
he
desired
to
smoke
.
He
ducked
his
head
,
like
a
turtle
going
into
its
*NL*
shell
;
he
appeared
uneasy
;
he
skipped
two
pages
in
his
story
and
did
n't
*NL*
know
it
.
Five
miles
later
,
he
leaped
up
and
sought
the
porter
.
``
Say
,
*NL*
uh
,
George
,
have
you
got
a
--
''
The
porter
looked
patient
.
``
Have
you
got
a
*NL*
time-table
?
''
Babbitt
finished
.
At
the
next
stop
he
went
out
and
bought
a
*NL*
cigar
.
Since
it
was
to
be
his
last
before
he
reached
Zenith
,
he
finished
*NL*
it
down
to
an
inch
stub
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
days
later
he
again
remembered
that
he
had
stopped
smoking
,
but
he
*NL*
was
too
busy
catching
up
with
his
office-work
to
keep
it
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Baseball
,
he
determined
,
would
be
an
excellent
hobby
.
``
No
sense
a
man
's
*NL*
working
his
fool
head
off
.
I
'm
going
out
to
the
Game
three
times
a
week
.
*NL*
Besides
,
fellow
ought
to
support
the
home
team
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
go
and
support
the
team
,
and
enhance
the
glory
of
Zenith
,
by
*NL*
yelling
``
Attaboy
!
''
and
``
Rotten
!
''
He
performed
the
rite
scrupulously
.
He
*NL*
wore
a
cotton
handkerchief
about
his
collar
;
he
became
sweaty
;
he
opened
*NL*
his
mouth
in
a
wide
loose
grin
;
and
drank
lemon
soda
out
of
a
bottle
.
He
*NL*
went
to
the
Game
three
times
a
week
,
for
one
week
.
Then
he
compromised
*NL*
on
watching
the
Advocate-Times
bulletin-board
.
He
stood
in
the
thickest
*NL*
and
steamiest
of
the
crowd
,
and
as
the
boy
up
on
the
lofty
platform
*NL*
recorded
the
achievements
of
Big
Bill
Bostwick
,
the
pitcher
,
Babbitt
*NL*
remarked
to
complete
strangers
,
``
Pretty
nice
!
Good
work
!
''
and
hastened
*NL*
back
to
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
honestly
believed
that
he
loved
baseball
.
It
is
true
that
he
had
n't
,
*NL*
in
twenty-five
years
,
himself
played
any
baseball
except
back-lot
catch
*NL*
with
Ted
--
very
gentle
,
and
strictly
limited
to
ten
minutes
.
But
the
*NL*
game
was
a
custom
of
his
clan
,
and
it
gave
outlet
for
the
homicidal
and
*NL*
sides-taking
instincts
which
Babbitt
called
``
patriotism
''
and
``
love
of
*NL*
sport
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
the
office
he
walked
faster
and
faster
,
muttering
,
*NL*
``
Guess
better
hustle
.
''
All
about
him
the
city
was
hustling
,
for
*NL*
hustling
's
sake
.
Men
in
motors
were
hustling
to
pass
one
another
in
*NL*
the
hustling
traffic
.
Men
were
hustling
to
catch
trolleys
,
with
another
*NL*
trolley
a
minute
behind
,
and
to
leap
from
the
trolleys
,
to
gallop
across
*NL*
the
sidewalk
,
to
hurl
themselves
into
buildings
,
into
hustling
express
*NL*
elevators
.
Men
in
dairy
lunches
were
hustling
to
gulp
down
the
food
*NL*
which
cooks
had
hustled
to
fry
.
Men
in
barber
shops
were
snapping
,
``
Jus
'
*NL*
shave
me
once
over
.
Got
ta
hustle
.
''
Men
were
feverishly
getting
rid
of
*NL*
visitors
in
offices
adorned
with
the
signs
,
``
This
Is
My
Busy
Day
''
and
*NL*
``
The
Lord
Created
the
World
in
Six
Days

You
Can
Spiel
All

*NL*
Say

''
Men
who
had
made
five
thousand
,
year
before
last
,
*NL*
and
ten
thousand
last
year
,
were
urging
on
nerve-yelping
bodies
and
*NL*
parched
brains
so
that
they
might
make
twenty
thousand
this
year
;
*NL*
and
the
men
who
had
broken
down
immediately
after
making
their
twenty
*NL*
thousand
dollars
were
hustling
to
catch
trains
,
to
hustle
through
the
*NL*
vacations
which
the
hustling
doctors
had
ordered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
them
Babbitt
hustled
back
to
his
office
,
to
sit
down
with
*NL*
nothing
much
to
do
except
see
that
the
staff
looked
as
though
they
were
*NL*
hustling
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
Every
Saturday
afternoon
he
hustled
out
to
his
country
club
and
hustled
*NL*
through
nine
holes
of
golf
as
a
rest
after
the
week
's
hustle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Zenith
it
was
as
necessary
for
a
Successful
Man
to
belong
to
a
*NL*
country
club
as
it
was
to
wear
a
linen
collar
.
Babbitt
's
was
the
Outing
*NL*
Golf
and
Country
Club
,
a
pleasant
gray-shingled
building
with
a
broad
*NL*
porch
,
on
a
daisy-starred
cliff
above
Lake
Kennepoose
.
There
was
*NL*
another
,
the
Tonawanda
Country
Club
,
to
which
belonged
Charles
McKelvey
,
*NL*
Horace
Updike
,
and
the
other
rich
men
who
lunched
not
at
the
Athletic
*NL*
but
at
the
Union
Club
.
Babbitt
explained
with
frequency
,
``
You
could
n't
*NL*
hire
me
to
join
the
Tonawanda
,
even
if
I
did
have
a
hundred
and
eighty
*NL*
bucks
to
throw
away
on
the
initiation
fee
.
At
the
Outing
we
've
got
*NL*
a
bunch
of
real
human
fellows
,
and
the
finest
lot
of
little
women
in
*NL*
town
--
just
as
good
at
joshing
as
the
men
--
but
at
the
Tonawanda
there
's
*NL*
nothing
but
these
would-be
's
in
New
York
get-ups
,
drinking
tea
!
Too
*NL*
much
dog
altogether
.
Why
,
I
would
n't
join
the
Tonawanda
even
if
they
--
I
*NL*
would
n't
join
it
on
a
bet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
played
four
or
five
holes
,
he
relaxed
a
bit
,
his
*NL*
tobacco-fluttering
heart
beat
more
normally
,
and
his
voice
slowed
to
the
*NL*
drawling
of
his
hundred
generations
of
peasant
ancestors
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
once
a
week
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Babbitt
and
Tinka
went
to
the
movies
.
*NL*
Their
favorite
motion-picture
theater
was
the
Chateau
,
which
held
three
*NL*
thousand
spectators
and
had
an
orchestra
of
fifty
pieces
which
played
*NL*
Arrangements
from
the
Operas
and
suites
portraying
a
Day
on
the
Farm
,
*NL*
or
a
Four-alarm
Fire
.
In
the
stone
rotunda
,
decorated
with
*NL*
crown-embroidered
velvet
chairs
and
almost
medieval
tapestries
,
*NL*
parrakeets
sat
on
gilded
lotos
columns
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
exclamations
of
``
Well
,
by
golly
!
''
and
``
You
got
to
go
some
to
*NL*
beat
this
dump
!
''
Babbitt
admired
the
Chateau
.
As
he
stared
across
the
*NL*
thousands
of
heads
,
a
gray
plain
in
the
dimness
,
as
he
smelled
good
*NL*
clothes
and
mild
perfume
and
chewing-gum
,
he
felt
as
when
he
had
first
*NL*
seen
a
mountain
and
realized
how
very
,
very
much
earth
and
rock
there
*NL*
was
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
three
kinds
of
films
:
pretty
bathing
girls
with
bare
legs
;
*NL*
policemen
or
cowboys
and
an
industrious
shooting
of
revolvers
;
and
*NL*
funny
fat
men
who
ate
spaghetti
.
He
chuckled
with
immense
,
moist-eyed
*NL*
sentimentality
at
interludes
portraying
puppies
,
kittens
,
and
chubby
*NL*
babies
;
and
he
wept
at
deathbeds
and
old
mothers
being
patient
in
*NL*
mortgaged
cottages
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
preferred
the
pictures
in
which
*NL*
handsome
young
women
in
elaborate
frocks
moved
through
sets
ticketed
as
*NL*
the
drawing-rooms
of
New
York
millionaires
.
As
for
Tinka
,
she
preferred
,
*NL*
or
was
believed
to
prefer
,
whatever
her
parents
told
her
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
relaxations
--
baseball
,
golf
,
movies
,
bridge
,
motoring
,
long
*NL*
talks
with
Paul
at
the
Athletic
Club
,
or
at
the
Good
Red
Beef
and
Old
*NL*
English
Chop
House
--
were
necessary
to
Babbitt
,
for
he
was
entering
a
*NL*
year
of
such
activity
as
he
had
never
known
.

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
by
accident
that
Babbitt
had
his
opportunity
to
address
the
S.
A.
*NL*
R.
E.
B
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
S.
A.
R.
E.
B.
,
as
its
members
called
it
,
with
the
universal
*NL*
passion
for
mysterious
and
important-sounding
initials
,
was
the
State
*NL*
Association
of
Real
Estate
Boards
;
the
organization
of
brokers
and
*NL*
operators
.
It
was
to
hold
its
annual
convention
at
Monarch
,
Zenith
's
*NL*
chief
rival
among
the
cities
of
the
state
.
Babbitt
was
an
official
*NL*
delegate
;
another
was
Cecil
Rountree
,
whom
Babbitt
admired
for
his
*NL*
picaresque
speculative
building
,
and
hated
for
his
social
position
,
*NL*
for
being
present
at
the
smartest
dances
on
Royal
Ridge
.
Rountree
was
*NL*
chairman
of
the
convention
program-committee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
growled
to
him
,
``
Makes
me
tired
the
way
these
doctors
and
*NL*
profs
and
preachers
put
on
lugs
about
being
`
professional
men
.
'
A
good
*NL*
realtor
has
to
have
more
knowledge
and
finesse
than
any
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
are
!
I
say
:
Why
do
n't
you
put
that
into
a
paper
,
and
give
it
*NL*
at
the
S.
A.
R.
E.
B.
?
''
suggested
Rountree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
would
help
you
in
making
up
the
program
--
Tell
you
:
the
way
*NL*
I
look
at
it
is
this
:
First
place
,
we
ought
to
insist
that
folks
call
*NL*
us
`
realtors
'
and
not
`
real-estate
men
.
'
Sounds
more
like
a
reg
`
lar
*NL*
profession
.
Second
place
--
What
is
it
distinguishes
a
profession
from
a
*NL*
mere
trade
,
business
,
or
occupation
?
What
is
it
?
Why
,
it
's
the
public
*NL*
service
and
the
skill
,
the
trained
skill
,
and
the
knowledge
and
,
uh
,
*NL*
all
that
,
whereas
a
fellow
that
merely
goes
out
for
the
jack
,
he
never
*NL*
considers
the-public
service
and
trained
skill
and
so
on
.
Now
as
a
*NL*
professional
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
!
That
's
perfectly
bully
!
Perfectly
corking
!
Now
you
write
it
in
*NL*
a
paper
,
''
said
Rountree
,
as
he
rapidly
and
firmly
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
However
accustomed
to
the
literary
labors
of
advertisements
and
*NL*
correspondence
,
Babbitt
was
dismayed
on
the
evening
when
he
sat
down
to
*NL*
prepare
a
paper
which
would
take
a
whole
ten
minutes
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
out
a
new
fifteen-cent
school
exercise-book
on
his
wife
's
*NL*
collapsible
sewing-table
,
set
up
for
the
event
in
the
living-room
.
The
*NL*
household
had
been
bullied
into
silence
;
Verona
and
Ted
requested
to
*NL*
disappear
,
and
Tinka
threatened
with
``
If
I
hear
one
sound
out
of
you
--
if
*NL*
you
holler
for
a
glass
of
water
one
single
solitary
time
--
You
better
*NL*
not
,
that
's
all
!
''
Mrs.
Babbitt
sat
over
by
the
piano
,
making
a
nightgown
*NL*
and
gazing
with
respect
while
Babbitt
wrote
in
the
exercise-book
,
to
the
*NL*
rhythmical
wiggling
and
squeaking
of
the
sewing-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
rose
,
damp
and
jumpy
,
and
his
throat
dusty
from
cigarettes
,
*NL*
she
marveled
,
``
I
do
n't
see
how
you
can
just
sit
down
and
make
up
things
*NL*
right
out
of
your
own
head
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
the
training
in
constructive
imagination
that
a
fellow
gets
in
*NL*
modern
business
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
written
seven
pages
,
whereof
the
first
page
set
forth
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
-LCB-

*NL*
*NL*
The
other
six
pages
were
rather
like
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
he
went
about
looking
important
.
Every
morning
,
as
he
*NL*
dressed
,
he
thought
aloud
:
``
Jever
stop
to
consider
,
Myra
,
that
before
*NL*
a
town
can
have
buildings
or
prosperity
or
any
of
those
things
,
some
*NL*
realtor
has
got
to
sell
'em
the
land
?
All
civilization
starts
with
him
.
*NL*
Jever
realize
that
?
''
At
the
Athletic
Club
he
led
unwilling
men
aside
to
*NL*
inquire
,
``
Say
,
if
you
had
to
read
a
paper
before
a
big
convention
,
would
*NL*
you
start
in
with
the
funny
stories
or
just
kind
of
scatter
'em
all
*NL*
through
?
''
He
asked
Howard
Littlefield
for
a
``
set
of
statistics
about
*NL*
real-estate
sales
;
something
good
and
impressive
,
''
and
Littlefield
*NL*
provided
something
exceedingly
good
and
impressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
to
T.
Cholmondeley
Frink
that
Babbitt
most
often
turned
.
He
*NL*
caught
Frink
at
the
club
every
noon
,
and
demanded
,
while
Frink
*NL*
looked
hunted
and
evasive
,
``
Say
,
Chum
--
you
're
a
shark
on
this
*NL*
writing
stuff
--
how
would
you
put
this
sentence
,
see
here
in
my
*NL*
manuscript
--
manuscript
now
where
the
deuce
is
that
?
--
oh
,
yes
,
here

*NL*
Would
you
say
`
We
ought
not
also

'
or
`
We
ought
also
not
*NL*
to

or

*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
his
wife
was
away
and
he
had
no
one
to
impress
,
Babbitt
*NL*
forgot
about
Style
,
Order
,
and
the
other
mysteries
,
and
scrawled
off
*NL*
what
he
really
thought
about
the
real-estate
business
and
about
himself
,
*NL*
and
he
found
the
paper
written
.
When
he
read
it
to
his
wife
she
yearned
,
*NL*
``
Why
,
dear
,
it
's
splendid
;
beautifully
written
,
and
so
clear
and
*NL*
interesting
,
and
such
splendid
ideas
!
Why
,
it
's
just
--
it
's
just
*NL*
splendid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
he
cornered
Chum
Frink
and
crowed
,
``
Well
,
old
son
,
I
finished
*NL*
it
last
evening
!
Just
lammed
it
out
!
I
used
to
think
you
writing-guys
*NL*
must
have
a
hard
job
making
up
pieces
,
but
Lord
,
it
's
a
cinch
.
Pretty
*NL*
soft
for
you
fellows
;
you
certainly
earn
your
money
easy
!
Some
day
when
*NL*
I
get
ready
to
retire
,
guess
I
'll
take
to
writing
and
show
you
boys
how
*NL*
to
do
it
.
I
always
used
to
think
I
could
write
better
stuff
,
and
more
*NL*
punch
and
originality
,
than
all
this
stuff
you
see
printed
,
and
now
I
'm
*NL*
doggone
sure
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
four
copies
of
the
paper
typed
in
black
with
a
gorgeous
red
*NL*
title
,
had
them
bound
in
pale
blue
manilla
,
and
affably
presented
one
to
*NL*
old
Ira
Runyon
,
the
managing
editor
of
the
Advocate-Times
,
who
said
yes
,
*NL*
indeed
yes
,
he
was
very
glad
to
have
it
,
and
he
certainly
would
read
it
*NL*
all
through
--
as
soon
as
he
could
find
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
could
not
go
to
Monarch
.
She
had
a
women
's
-
club
meeting
.
*NL*
Babbitt
said
that
he
was
very
sorry
.

*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
five
official
delegates
to
the
convention
--
Babbitt
,
*NL*
Rountree
,
W.
A.
Rogers
,
Alvin
Thayer
,
and
Elbert
Wing
--
there
were
fifty
*NL*
unofficial
delegates
,
most
of
them
with
their
wives
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
met
at
the
Union
Station
for
the
midnight
train
to
Monarch
.
All
*NL*
of
them
,
save
Cecil
Rountree
,
who
was
such
a
snob
that
he
never
wore
*NL*
badges
,
displayed
celluloid
buttons
the
size
of
dollars
and
lettered
``
We
*NL*
zoom
for
Zenith
.
''
The
official
delegates
were
magnificent
with
silver
*NL*
and
magenta
ribbons
.
Martin
Lumsen
's
little
boy
Willy
carried
a
tasseled
*NL*
banner
inscribed
``
Zenith
the
Zip
City
--
Zeal
,
Zest
and
Zowie
--
1,000,000
*NL*
in
1935
.
''
As
the
delegates
arrived
,
not
in
taxicabs
but
in
the
family
*NL*
automobile
driven
by
the
oldest
son
or
by
Cousin
Fred
,
they
formed
*NL*
impromptu
processions
through
the
station
waiting-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
new
and
enormous
waiting-room
,
with
marble
pilasters
,
and
*NL*
frescoes
depicting
the
exploration
of
the
Chaloosa
River
Valley
by
Pere
*NL*
Emile
Fauthoux
in
1740
.
The
benches
were
shelves
of
ponderous
mahogany
;
*NL*
the
news-stand
a
marble
kiosk
with
a
brass
grill
.
Down
the
echoing
*NL*
spaces
of
the
hall
the
delegates
paraded
after
Willy
Lumsen
's
banner
,
*NL*
the
men
waving
their
cigars
,
the
women
conscious
of
their
new
frocks
and
*NL*
strings
of
beads
,
all
singing
to
the
tune
of
Auld
Lang
Syne
the
official
*NL*
City
Song
,
written
by
Chum
Frink
:
*NL*
*NL*
Good
old
Zenith
,
*NL*
Our
kin
and
kith
,
*NL*
Wherever
we
may
be
,
*NL*
Hats
in
the
ring
,
*NL*
We
blithely
sing
*NL*
Of
thy

*NL*
*NL*
Warren
Whitby
,
the
broker
,
who
had
a
gift
of
verse
for
banquets
and
*NL*
birthdays
,
had
added
to
Frink
's
City
Song
a
special
verse
for
the
*NL*
realtors
'
convention
:
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
here
we
come
,
*NL*
The
fellows
from
*NL*
Zenith
,
the
Zip
Citee
.
*NL*
We
wish
to
state
*NL*
In
real
estate
*NL*
There
's
none
so
live
as
we
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
stirred
to
hysteric
patriotism
.
He
leaped
on
a
bench
,
*NL*
shouting
to
the
crowd
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
Zenith
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
best
ole
town
in
the
U.
S.
A.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zeeeeeen-ith
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
patient
poor
people
waiting
for
the
midnight
train
stared
in
*NL*
unenvious
wonder
--
Italian
women
with
shawls
,
old
weary
men
with
broken
*NL*
shoes
,
roving
road-wise
boys
in
suits
which
had
been
flashy
when
they
*NL*
were
new
but
which
were
faded
now
and
wrinkled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
perceived
that
as
an
official
delegate
he
must
be
more
*NL*
dignified
.
With
Wing
and
Rogers
he
tramped
up
and
down
the
cement
*NL*
platform
beside
the
waiting
Pullmans
.
Motor-driven
baggage-trucks
*NL*
and
red-capped
porters
carrying
bags
sped
down
the
platform
with
an
*NL*
agreeable
effect
of
activity
.
Arc-lights
glared
and
stammered
overhead
.
*NL*
The
glossy
yellow
sleeping-cars
shone
impressively
.
Babbitt
made
his
*NL*
voice
to
be
measured
and
lordly
;
he
thrust
out
his
abdomen
and
rumbled
,
*NL*
``
We
got
to
see
to
it
that
the
convention
lets
the
Legislature
understand
*NL*
just
where
they
get
off
in
this
matter
of
taxing
realty
transfers
.
''
Wing
*NL*
uttered
approving
grunts
and
Babbitt
swelled
--
gloated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
of
a
Pullman
compartment
was
raised
,
and
Babbitt
looked
*NL*
into
an
unfamiliar
world
.
The
occupant
of
the
compartment
was
Lucile
*NL*
McKelvey
,
the
pretty
wife
of
the
millionaire
contractor
.
Possibly
,
*NL*
Babbitt
thrilled
,
she
was
going
to
Europe
!
On
the
seat
beside
her
was
a
*NL*
bunch
of
orchids
and
violets
,
and
a
yellow
paper-bound
book
which
seemed
*NL*
foreign
.
While
he
stared
,
she
picked
up
the
book
,
then
glanced
out
of
*NL*
the
window
as
though
she
was
bored
.
She
must
have
looked
straight
at
*NL*
him
,
and
he
had
met
her
,
but
she
gave
no
sign
.
She
languidly
pulled
down
*NL*
the
blind
,
and
he
stood
still
,
a
cold
feeling
of
insignificance
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
the
train
his
pride
was
restored
by
meeting
delegates
from
*NL*
Sparta
,
Pioneer
,
and
other
smaller
cities
of
the
state
,
who
listened
*NL*
respectfully
when
,
as
a
magnifico
from
the
metropolis
of
Zenith
,
*NL*
he
explained
politics
and
the
value
of
a
Good
Sound
Business
*NL*
Administration
.
They
fell
joyfully
into
shop-talk
,
the
purest
and
most
*NL*
rapturous
form
of
conversation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'd
this
fellow
Rountree
make
out
with
this
big
apartment-hotel
he
*NL*
was
going
to
put
up
?
Whadde
do
?
Get
out
bonds
to
finance
it
?
''
asked
a
*NL*
Sparta
broker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Babbitt
.
``
Now
if
I
'd
been
handling
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
Elbert
Wing
was
droning
,
``
I
hired
this
shop-window
for
a
week
,
and
*NL*
put
up
a
big
sign
,
`
Toy
Town

Tiny
Tots
,
'
and
stuck
in
a
lot
of
doll
*NL*
houses
and
some
dinky
little
trees
,
and
then
down
at
the
bottom
,

certainly
got
folks
talking

*NL*
*NL*
The
trucks
sang
``
lickety-lick
,
lickety-lick
''
as
the
train
ran
through
*NL*
the
factory
district
.
Furnaces
spurted
flame
,
and
power-hammers
were
*NL*
clanging
.
Red
lights
,
green
lights
,
furious
white
lights
rushed
past
,
*NL*
and
Babbitt
was
important
again
,
and
eager
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
a
voluptuous
thing
:
he
had
his
clothes
pressed
on
the
train
.
In
*NL*
the
morning
,
half
an
hour
before
they
reached
Monarch
,
the
porter
came
*NL*
to
his
berth
and
whispered
,
``
There
's
a
drawing-room
vacant
,
sir
.
I
put
*NL*
your
suit
in
there
.
''
In
tan
autumn
overcoat
over
his
pajamas
,
Babbitt
*NL*
slipped
down
the
green-curtain-lined
aisle
to
the
glory
of
his
first
*NL*
private
compartment
.
The
porter
indicated
that
he
knew
Babbitt
was
*NL*
used
to
a
man-servant
;
he
held
the
ends
of
Babbitt
's
trousers
,
that
the
*NL*
beautifully
sponged
garment
might
not
be
soiled
,
filled
the
bowl
in
the
*NL*
private
washroom
,
and
waited
with
a
towel
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
a
private
washroom
was
luxurious
.
However
enlivening
a
Pullman
*NL*
smoking-compartment
was
by
night
,
even
to
Babbitt
it
was
depressing
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
when
it
was
jammed
with
fat
men
in
woolen
undershirts
,
*NL*
every
hook
filled
with
wrinkled
cottony
shirts
,
the
leather
seat
piled
*NL*
with
dingy
toilet-kits
,
and
the
air
nauseating
with
the
smell
of
soap
*NL*
and
toothpaste
.
Babbitt
did
not
ordinarily
think
much
of
privacy
,
but
*NL*
now
he
reveled
in
it
,
reveled
in
his
valet
,
and
purred
with
pleasure
as
*NL*
he
gave
the
man
a
tip
of
a
dollar
and
a
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rather
hoped
that
he
was
being
noticed
as
,
in
his
newly
pressed
*NL*
clothes
,
with
the
adoring
porter
carrying
his
suit-case
,
he
disembarked
*NL*
at
Monarch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
to
share
a
room
at
the
Hotel
Sedgwick
with
W.
A.
Rogers
,
that
*NL*
shrewd
,
rustic-looking
Zenith
dealer
in
farm-lands
.
Together
they
had
*NL*
a
noble
breakfast
,
with
waffles
,
and
coffee
not
in
exiguous
cups
but
*NL*
in
large
pots
.
Babbitt
grew
expansive
,
and
told
Rogers
about
the
art
of
*NL*
writing
;
he
gave
a
bellboy
a
quarter
to
fetch
a
morning
newspaper
from
*NL*
the
lobby
,
and
sent
to
Tinka
a
post-card
:
``
Papa
wishes
you
were
here
to
*NL*
bat
round
with
him
.

The
meetings
of
the
convention
were
held
in
the
ballroom
of
the
Allen
*NL*
House
.
In
an
anteroom
was
the
office
of
the
chairman
of
the
executive
*NL*
committee
.
He
was
the
busiest
man
in
the
convention
;
he
was
so
busy
that
*NL*
he
got
nothing
done
whatever
.
He
sat
at
a
marquetry
table
,
in
a
room
*NL*
littered
with
crumpled
paper
and
,
all
day
long
,
town-boosters
and
*NL*
lobbyists
and
orators
who
wished
to
lead
debates
came
and
whispered
to
*NL*
him
,
whereupon
he
looked
vague
,
and
said
rapidly
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
a
*NL*
fine
idea
;
we
'll
do
that
,
''
and
instantly
forgot
all
about
it
,
lighted
*NL*
a
cigar
and
forgot
that
too
,
while
the
telephone
rang
mercilessly
and
*NL*
about
him
men
kept
beseeching
,
``
Say
,
Mr.
Chairman
--
say
,
Mr.
Chairman
!
''
*NL*
without
penetrating
his
exhausted
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
exhibit-room
were
plans
of
the
new
suburbs
of
Sparta
,
pictures
*NL*
of
the
new
state
capitol
,
at
Galop
de
Vache

and
large
ears
of
corn
with
*NL*
the
label
,
``

the
Garden

The
real
convention
consisted
of
men
muttering
in
hotel
bedrooms
or
in
*NL*
groups
amid
the
badge-spotted
crowd
in
the
hotel-lobby
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
show
of
public
meetings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
them
opened
with
a
welcome
by
the
mayor
of
Monarch
.
The
*NL*
pastor
of
the
First
Christian
Church
of
Monarch
,
a
large
man
with
a
long
*NL*
damp
frontal
lock
,
informed
God
that
the
real-estate
men
were
here
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
venerable
Minnemagantic
realtor
,
Major
Carlton
Tuke
,
read
a
paper
in
*NL*
which
he
denounced
cooperative
stores
.
William
A.
Larkin
of
Eureka
gave
*NL*
a
comforting
prognosis
of
``
The
Prospects

Increased
Construction

*NL*
and
reminded
them
that
plate-glass
prices
were
two

The
convention
was
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
delegates
were
entertained
,
incessantly
and
firmly
.
The
Monarch
*NL*
Chamber
of
Commerce
gave
them
a
banquet
,
and
the
Manufacturers
'
*NL*
Association
an
afternoon
reception
,
at
which
a
chrysanthemum
was
*NL*
presented
to
each
of
the
ladies
,
and
to
each
of
the
men
a
leather
*NL*
bill-fold
inscribed
``

*NL*
Mrs.
Crosby
Knowlton
,
wife
of
the
manufacturer
of
Fleetwing
Automobiles
,
*NL*
opened
her
celebrated
Italian
garden
and
served
tea
.
Six
hundred
*NL*
real-estate
men
and
wives
ambled
down
the
autumnal
paths
.
Perhaps
*NL*
three
hundred
of
them
were
quietly
inconspicuous
;
perhaps
three
hundred
*NL*
vigorously
exclaimed
,
``
This
is
pretty
slick
,
eh
?
''
surreptitiously
picked
*NL*
the
late
asters
and
concealed
them
in
their
pockets
,
and
tried
to
get
*NL*
near
enough
to
Mrs.
Knowlton
to
shake
her
lovely
hand
.
Without
request
,
*NL*
the
Zenith
delegates
-LRB-
except
Rountree
-RRB-
gathered
round
a
marble
dancing
*NL*
nymph
and
sang
``
Here
we
come
,
the
fellows
from

,
the
Zip
Citee

*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
all
the
delegates
from
Pioneer
belonged
to
the
Brotherly
*NL*
and
Protective
Order
of
Elks
,
and
they
produced
an
enormous
banner
*NL*
lettered
:
``

*NL*
Nor
was
Galop

Vache
,
the
state
capital
,
to
be
slighted

The
leader
*NL*
of
the
Galop
de
Vache
delegation
was
a
large
,
reddish
,
roundish
man
,
*NL*
but
active
.
He
took
off
his
coat
,
hurled
his
broad
black
felt
hat
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
rolled
up
his
sleeves
,
climbed
upon
the
sundial
,
spat
,
and
*NL*
bellowed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
tell

own
their

n't
starting

they
're
raising

instead
of
raising

The
guests
drove
off
;
the
garden
shivered
into
quiet
.
But
Mrs.
Crosby
*NL*
Knowlton
sighed
as
she
looked
at
a
marble
seat
warm
from
five
hundred
*NL*
summers
of
Amalfi
.
On
the
face
of
a
winged
sphinx
which
supported
it
*NL*
some
one
had
drawn
a
mustache
in
lead-pencil
.
Crumpled
paper
napkins
*NL*
were
dumped
among
the
Michaelmas
daisies
.
On
the
walk
,
like
shredded
*NL*
lovely
flesh
,
were
the
petals
of
the
last
gallant
rose
.
Cigarette
stubs
*NL*
floated
in
the
goldfish
pool
,
trailing
an
evil
stain
as
they
swelled
and
*NL*
disintegrated
,
and
beneath
the
marble
seat
,
the
fragments
carefully
put
*NL*
together
,
was
a
smashed
teacup
.

As
he
rode
back
to
the
hotel
Babbitt
reflected
,
``
Myra
would
have
enjoyed
*NL*
all
this
social
agony
.
''
For
himself
he
cared
less
for
the
garden
party
*NL*
than
for
the
motor
tours
which
the
Monarch
Chamber
of
Commerce
*NL*
had
arranged
.
Indefatigably
he
viewed
water-reservoirs
,
suburban
*NL*
trolley-stations
,
and
tanneries
.
He
devoured
the
statistics
which
were
*NL*
given
to
him
,
and
marveled
to
his
roommate
,
W.
A.
Rogers
,
``
Of
course
*NL*
this
town
is
n't
a
patch
on
Zenith
;
it
has
n't
got
our
outlook
and
*NL*
natural
resources
;
but
did
you
know
--
I
nev
'
did
till
to-day
--
that
they
*NL*
manufactured
seven
hundred
and
sixty-three
million
feet
of
lumber
last
*NL*
year

What
d'
you
think
of
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
nervous
as
the
time
for
reading
his
paper
approached
.
When
he
*NL*
stood
on
the
low
platform
before
the
convention
,
he
trembled
and
saw
*NL*
only
a
purple
haze
.
But
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
when
he
had
finished
the
*NL*
formal
paper
he
talked
to
them
,
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
his
spectacled
*NL*
face
a
flashing
disk
,
like
a
plate
set
up
on
edge
in
the
lamplight
.
*NL*
They
shouted
``
That
's
the
stuff
!
''
and
in
the
discussion
afterward
they
*NL*
referred
with
impressiveness
to
``
our
friend
and
brother
,
Mr.
George
F.
*NL*
Babbitt
.
''
He
had
in
fifteen
minutes
changed
from
a
minor
delegate
to
*NL*
a
personage
almost
as
well
known
as
that
diplomat
of
business
,
Cecil
*NL*
Rountree
.
After
the
meeting
,
delegates
from
all
over
the
state
said
,
*NL*
``
Hower
you
,
Brother
Babbitt
?
''
Sixteen
complete
strangers
called
him
*NL*
``
George
,
''
and
three
men
took
him
into
corners
to
confide
,
``
Mighty
glad
*NL*
you
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
and
give
the
Profession
a
real
boost

Now
I
've
always
maintained

''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
with
tremendous
casualness
,
Babbitt
asked
the
girl
at
the
*NL*
hotel
news-stand
for
the
newspapers
from
Zenith
.
There
was
nothing
in
*NL*
the
Press
,
but
in
the
Advocate-Times
,
on
the
third
page
--
He
gasped
.
*NL*
They
had
printed
his
picture
and
a
half-column
account
.
The
heading
was
*NL*
``

He
murmured
reverently
,
``
I
guess
some
of
the
folks
on
Floral
Heights

will
sit
up
and
take
notice
now

little
attention
to

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
last
meeting
.
The
delegations
were
presenting
the
claims
*NL*
of
their
several
cities
to
the
next
year
's
convention
.
Orators
were
*NL*
announcing
that
``
Galop
de
Vache
,
the
Capital
City
,
the
site
of
Kremer
*NL*
College
and
of
the
Upholtz
Knitting
Works
,
is
the
recognized
center
of
*NL*
culture
and
high-class
enterprise
;
''
and
that
``
Hamburg
,
the
Big
Little
*NL*
City
with
the
Logical
Location
,
where
every
man
is
open-handed
and
every
*NL*
woman
a
heaven-born
hostess
,
throws
wide
to
you
her
hospitable
gates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
these
more
diffident
invitations
,
the
golden
doors
of
*NL*
the
ballroom
opened
with
a
blatting
of
trumpets
,
and
a
circus
*NL*
parade
rolled
in
.
It
was
composed
of
the
Zenith
brokers
,
dressed
as
*NL*
cowpunchers
,
bareback
riders
,
Japanese
jugglers
.
At
the
head
was
*NL*
big
Warren
Whitby
,
in
the
bearskin
and
gold-and-crimson
coat
of
a
*NL*
drum-major
.
Behind
him
,
as
a
clown
,
beating
a
bass
drum
,
extraordinarily
*NL*
happy
and
noisy
,
was
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Warren
Whitby
leaped
on
the
platform
,
made
merry
play
with
his
baton
,
*NL*
and
observed
,
``
Boyses
and
girlses
,
the
time
has
came
to
get
down
to
*NL*
cases
.
A
dyed-in-the-wool
Zenithite
sure
loves
his
neighbors
,
but
we
've
*NL*
made
up
our
minds
to
grab
this
convention
off
our
neighbor
burgs
like
*NL*
we
've
grabbed
the
condensed-milk
business
and
the
paper-box
business
*NL*
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
J.
Harry
Barmhill
,
the
convention
chairman
,
hinted
,
``
We
're
grateful
to
*NL*
you
,
Mr.
Uh
,
but
you
must
give
the
other
boys
a
chance
to
hand
in
their
*NL*
bids
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fog-horn
voice
blared
,
``
In
Eureka
we
'll
promise
free
motor
rides
*NL*
through
the
prettiest
country

''
*NL*
*NL*
Running
down
the
aisle
,
clapping
his
hands
,
a
lean
bald
young
man
cried
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
from
Sparta
!
Our
Chamber
of
Commerce
has
wired
me
they
've
set
aside
*NL*
eight
thousand
dollars
,
in
real
money
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
*NL*
convention
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
clerical-looking
man
rose
to
clamor
,
``
Money
talks
!
Move
we
accept
the
*NL*
bid
from
Sparta
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Committee
on
Resolutions
was
reporting
.
They
said
that
Whereas
*NL*
Almighty
God
in
his
beneficent
mercy
had
seen
fit
to
remove
to
a
sphere
*NL*
of
higher
usefulness
some
thirty-six
realtors
of
the
state
the
past
*NL*
year
,
Therefore
it
was
the
sentiment
of
this
convention
assembled
that
*NL*
they
were
sorry
God
had
done
it
,
and
the
secretary
should
be
,
and
hereby
*NL*
was
,
instructed
to
spread
these
resolutions
on
the
minutes
,
and
to
*NL*
console
the
bereaved
families
by
sending
them
each
a
copy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
resolution
authorized
the
president
of
the
S.A.R.E.B.
to
spend
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
dollars
in
lobbying
for
sane
tax
measures
in
the
State
*NL*
Legislature
.
This
resolution
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
Menaces
to
*NL*
Sound
Business
and
clearing
the
Wheels
of
Progress
from
ill-advised
and
*NL*
shortsighted
obstacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Committee
on
Committees
reported
,
and
with
startled
awe
Babbitt
*NL*
learned
that
he
had
been
appointed
a
member
of
the
Committee
on
Torrens
*NL*
Titles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rejoiced
,
``
I
said
it
was
going
to
be
a
great
year
!
Georgie
,
old
son
,
*NL*
you
got
big
things
ahead
of
you
!
You
're
a
natural-born
orator
and
a
good
*NL*
mixer
and

Zowie
!

IX
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
formal
entertainment
provided
for
the
last
evening
.
Babbitt
*NL*
had
planned
to
go
home
,
but
that
afternoon
the
Jered
Sassburgers
of
*NL*
Pioneer
suggested
that
Babbitt
and
W.
A.
Rogers
have
tea
with
them
at
*NL*
the
Catalpa
Inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Teas
were
not
unknown
to
Babbitt
--
his
wife
and
he
earnestly
attended
*NL*
them
at
least
twice
a
year
--
but
they
were
sufficiently
exotic
to
make
*NL*
him
feel
important
.
He
sat
at
a
glass-covered
table
in
the
Art
Room
of
*NL*
the
Inn
,
with
its
painted
rabbits
,
mottoes
lettered
on
birch
bark
,
and
*NL*
waitresses
being
artistic
in
Dutch
caps
;
he
ate
insufficient
lettuce
*NL*
sandwiches
,
and
was
lively
and
naughty
with
Mrs.
Sassburger
,
who
was
as
*NL*
smooth
and
large-eyed
as
a
cloak-model
.
Sassburger
and
he
had
met
two
*NL*
days
before
,
so
they
were
calling
each
other
``
Georgie
''
and
``
Sassy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sassburger
said
prayerfully
,
``
Say
,
boys
,
before
you
go
,
seeing
this
is
*NL*
the
last
chance
,
I
've
GOT
IT
,
up
in
my
room
,
and
Miriam
here
is
the
best
*NL*
little
mixelogist
in
the
Stati
Unidos
like
us
Italians
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
wide
flowing
gestures
,
Babbitt
and
Rogers
followed
the
Sassburgers
*NL*
to
their
room
.
Mrs.
Sassburger
shrieked
,
``
Oh
,
how
terrible
!
''
when
she
*NL*
saw
that
she
had
left
a
chemise
of
sheer
lavender
crepe
on
the
bed
.
She
*NL*
tucked
it
into
a
bag
,
while
Babbitt
giggled
,
``
Do
n't
mind
us
;
we
're
a
*NL*
couple
o
'
little
divvils
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sassburger
telephoned
for
ice
,
and
the
bell-boy
who
brought
it
said
,
*NL*
prosaically
and
unprompted
,
``
Highball
glasses
or
cocktail
?
''
Miriam
*NL*
Sassburger
mixed
the
cocktails
in
one
of
those
dismal
,
nakedly
white
*NL*
water-pitchers
which
exist
only
in
hotels
.
When
they
had
finished
*NL*
the
first
round
she
proved
by
intoning
``
Think
you
boys
could
stand
*NL*
another
--
you
got
a
dividend
coming
''
that
,
though
she
was
but
a
woman
,
*NL*
she
knew
the
complete
and
perfect
rite
of
cocktail-drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
,
Babbitt
hinted
to
Rogers
,
``
Say
,
W.
A.
,
old
rooster
,
it
comes
*NL*
over
me
that
I
could
stand
it
if
we
did
n't
go
back
to
the
lovin
'
wives
,
*NL*
this
handsome
ABEND
,
but
just
kind
of
stayed
in
Monarch
and
threw
a
*NL*
party
,
heh
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
you
speak
with
the
tongue
of
wisdom
and
sagashiteriferousness

*NL*
El
Wing
's
wife
has
gone
on
to
Pittsburg
.
Let
's
see
if
we
ca
n't
gather
*NL*
him
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
seven
they
sat
in
their
room
,
with
Elbert
Wing
and
two
*NL*
up-state
delegates
.
Their
coats
were
off
,
their
vests
open
,
their
faces
*NL*
red
,
their
voices
emphatic
.
They
were
finishing
a
bottle
of
corrosive
*NL*
bootlegged
whisky
and
imploring
the
bell-boy
,
``
Say
,
son
,
can
you
get
us
*NL*
some
more
of
this
embalming
fluid
?
''
They
were
smoking
large
cigars
and
*NL*
dropping
ashes
and
stubs
on
the
carpet
.
With
windy
guffaws
they
were
*NL*
telling
stories
.
They
were
,
in
fact
,
males
in
a
happy
state
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
sighed
,
``
I
do
n't
know
how
it
strikes
you
hellions
,
but
*NL*
personally
I
like
this
busting
loose
for
a
change
,
and
kicking
over
a
*NL*
couple
of
mountains
and
climbing
up
on
the
North
Pole
and
waving
the
*NL*
aurora
borealis
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
from
Sparta
,
a
grave
,
intense
youngster
,
babbled
,
``
Say
!
I
guess
*NL*
I
'm
as
good
a

as

mill

,
I
do
get
so
tired
*NL*
of
going
home
every
evening

and
nothing
to

but
the

That
's
*NL*

I
go

They
had
dinner
in
the
Moorish
Grillroom
of
the
Hotel
Sedgwick
.
*NL*
Somewhere
,
somehow
,
they
seemed
to
have
gathered
in
two
other
comrades
:
*NL*
a
manufacturer
of
fly-paper
and
a
dentist

They
all
drank
whisky
from
*NL*
tea-cups

they
were
humorous

never
listened
to
one
another

``

*NL*
``

''
said
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
put
off
departure
as
long
as
they
could
.
They
were
safe
while
*NL*
they
sat
here
,
legs
firmly
crossed
under
the
table
,
but
they
felt
*NL*
unsteady
;
they
were
afraid
of
navigating
the
long
and
slippery
floor
of
*NL*
the
grillroom
under
the
eyes
of
the
other
guests
and
the
too-attentive
*NL*
waiters
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
did
venture
,
tables
got
in
their
way
,
and
they
sought
to
cover
*NL*
embarrassment
by
heavy
jocularity
at
the
coatroom
.
As
the
girl
handed
*NL*
out
their
hats
,
they
smiled
at
her
,
and
hoped
that
she
,
a
cool
and
*NL*
expert
judge
,
would
feel
that
they
were
gentlemen
.
They
croaked
at
one
*NL*
another
,
``
Who
owns
the
bum
lid
?
''
and
``
You
take
a
good
one

George
;
I
'll
*NL*
take

''
and
to
the
check-girl
they
stammered
,
``
Better

*NL*
along

High
,
wide
,
and

All
of
them
tried
*NL*
to
tip
her
,
urging
one
another
,
``
No
!
Wait
!
Here
!
I
got
it
right
here

*NL*
Among
them
,
they
gave
her
three

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
Flamboyantly
smoking
cigars
they
sat
in
a
box
at
the
burlesque
show
,
*NL*
their
feet
up
on
the
rail
,
while
a
chorus
of
twenty
daubed
,
worried
,
*NL*
and
inextinguishably
respectable
grandams
swung
their
legs
in
the
more
*NL*
elementary
chorus-evolutions
,
and
a
Jewish
comedian
made
vicious
fun
of
*NL*
Jews
.
In
the
entr
`
actes
they
met
other
lone
delegates
.
A
dozen
of
them
*NL*
went
in
taxicabs
out
to
Bright
Blossom
Inn
,
where
the
blossoms
were
*NL*
made
of
dusty
paper
festooned
along
a
room
low
and
stinking
,
like
a
*NL*
cow-stable
no
longer
wisely
used
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
whisky
was
served
openly
,
in
glasses
.
Two
or
three
clerks
,
who
*NL*
on
pay-day
longed
to
be
taken
for
millionaires
,
sheepishly
danced
with
*NL*
telephone-girls
and
manicure-girls
in
the
narrow
space
between
the
*NL*
tables
.
Fantastically
whirled
the
professionals
,
a
young
man
in
sleek
*NL*
evening-clothes
and
a
slim
mad
girl
in
emerald
silk
,
with
amber
hair
*NL*
flung
up
as
jaggedly
as
flames
.
Babbitt
tried
to
dance
with
her
.
He
*NL*
shuffled
along
the
floor
,
too
bulky
to
be
guided
,
his
steps
unrelated
*NL*
to
the
rhythm
of
the
jungle
music
,
and
in
his
staggering
he
would
have
*NL*
fallen
,
had
she
not
held
him
with
supple
kindly
strength
.
He
was
blind
*NL*
and
deaf
from
prohibition-era
alcohol
;
he
could
not
see
the
tables
,
the
*NL*
faces
.
But
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
girl
and
her
young
pliant
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
firmly
returned
him
to
his
group
,
he
remembered
,
by
a
*NL*
connection
quite
untraceable
,
that
his
mother
's
mother
had
been
Scotch
,
*NL*
and
with
head
thrown
back
,
eyes
closed
,
wide
mouth
indicating
ecstasy
,
*NL*
he
sang
,
very
slowly
and
richly
,
``
Loch
Lomond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
was
the
last
of
his
mellowness
and
jolly
companionship
.
The
*NL*
man
from
Sparta
said
he
was
a
``
bum
singer
,
''
and
for
ten
minutes
Babbitt
*NL*
quarreled
with
him
,
in
a
loud
,
unsteady
,
heroic
indignation
.
They
called
*NL*
for
drinks
till
the
manager
insisted
that
the
place
was
closed
.
All
the
*NL*
while
Babbitt
felt
a
hot
raw
desire
for
more
brutal
amusements
.
When
*NL*
W.
A.
Rogers
drawled
,
``
What
say
we
go
down
the
line
and
look
over
the
*NL*
girls
?
''
he
agreed
savagely
.
Before
they
went
,
three
of
them
secretly
*NL*
made
appointments
with
the
professional
dancing
girl
,
who
agreed
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
sure
,
darling
''
to
everything
they
said
,
and
amiably
forgot
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drove
back
through
the
outskirts
of
Monarch
,
down
streets
of
*NL*
small
brown
wooden
cottages
of
workmen
,
characterless
as
cells
,
as
they
*NL*
rattled
across
warehouse-districts
which
by
drunken
night
seemed
vast
*NL*
and
perilous
,
as
they
were
borne
toward
the
red
lights
and
violent
*NL*
automatic
pianos
and
the
stocky
women
who
simpered
,
Babbitt
was
*NL*
frightened
.
He
wanted
to
leap
from
the
taxicab
,
but
all
his
body
was
a
*NL*
murky
fire
,
and
he
groaned
,
``
Too
late
to
quit
now
,
''
and
knew
that
he
did
*NL*
not
want
to
quit
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
they
felt
,
one
very
humorous
incident
on
the
way
.
A
broker
*NL*
from
Minnemagantic
said
,
``
Monarch
is
a
lot
sportier
than
Zenith
.
You
*NL*
Zenith
tightwads
have
n't
got
any
joints
like
these
here
.
''
Babbitt
raged
,
*NL*
``
That
's
a
dirty
lie
!
Snothin
'
you
ca
n't
find
in
Zenith
.
Believe
me
,
we
*NL*
got
more
houses
and
hootch-parlors
an
'
all
kinds
o
'
dives
than
any
burg
*NL*
in
the
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
realized
they
were
laughing
at
him
;
he
desired
to
fight
;
and
forgot
*NL*
it
in
such
musty
unsatisfying
experiments
as
he
had
not
known
since
*NL*
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
he
returned
to
Zenith
,
his
desire
for
rebellion
was
*NL*
partly
satisfied
.
He
had
retrograded
to
a
shamefaced
contentment
.
He
was
*NL*
irritable
.
He
did
not
smile
when
W.
A.
Rogers
complained
,
``
Ow
,
what
a
*NL*
head
!
I
certainly
do
feel
like
the
wrath
of
God
this
morning
.
Say
!
I
*NL*
know
what
was
the
trouble
!
Somebody
went
and
put
alcohol
in
my
booze
*NL*
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
excursion
was
never
known
to
his
family
,
nor
to
any
one
in
*NL*
Zenith
save
Rogers
and
Wing
.
It
was
not
officially
recognized
even
by
*NL*
himself
.
If
it
had
any
consequences
,
they
have
not
been
discovered
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
THIS
autumn
a
Mr.
W.
G.
Harding
,
of
Marion
,
Ohio
,
was
appointed
*NL*
President
of
the
United
States
,
but
Zenith
was
less
interested
in
the
*NL*
national
campaign
than
in
the
local
election
.
Seneca
Doane
,
though
he
*NL*
was
a
lawyer
and
a
graduate
of
the
State
University
,
was
candidate
for
*NL*
mayor
of
Zenith
on
an
alarming
labor
ticket
.
To
oppose
him
the
Democrats
*NL*
and
Republicans
united
on
Lucas
Prout
,
a
mattress-manufacturer
with
a
*NL*
perfect
record
for
sanity
.
Mr.
Prout
was
supported
by
the
banks
,
the
*NL*
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
all
the
decent
newspapers
,
and
George
F.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
precinct-leader
on
Floral
Heights
,
but
his
district
was
safe
*NL*
and
he
longed
for
stouter
battling
.
His
convention
paper
had
given
him
*NL*
the
beginning
of
a
reputation
for
oratory
,
so
the
Republican-Democratic
*NL*
Central
Committee
sent
him
to
the
Seventh
Ward
and
South
Zenith
,
to
*NL*
address
small
audiences
of
workmen
and
clerks
,
and
wives
uneasy
with
*NL*
their
new
votes
.
He
acquired
a
fame
enduring
for
weeks
.
Now
and
then
a
*NL*
reporter
was
present
at
one
of
his
meetings
,
and
the
headlines
-LRB-
though
*NL*
they
were
not
very
large
-RRB-
indicated
that
George
F.
Babbitt
had
addressed
*NL*
Cheering
Throng
,
and
Distinguished
Man
of
Affairs
had
pointed
out
the
*NL*
Fallacies
of
Doane
.
Once
,
in
the
rotogravure
section
of
the
Sunday
*NL*
Advocate-Times
,
there
was
a
photograph
of
Babbitt
and
a
dozen
other
*NL*
business
men
,
with
the
caption
``
Leaders
of
Zenith
Finance
and
Commerce
*NL*
Who
Back
Prout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
deserved
his
glory
.
He
was
an
excellent
campaigner
.
He
had
faith
;
he
*NL*
was
certain
that
if
Lincoln
were
alive
,
he
would
be
electioneering
for
*NL*
Mr.
W.
G.
Harding
--
unless
he
came
to
Zenith
and
electioneered
for
*NL*
Lucas
Prout
.
He
did
not
confuse
audiences
by
silly
subtleties
;
Prout
*NL*
represented
honest
industry
,
Seneca
Doane
represented
whining
laziness
,
*NL*
and
you
could
take
your
choice
.
With
his
broad
shoulders
and
vigorous
*NL*
voice
,
he
was
obviously
a
Good
Fellow
;
and
,
rarest
of
all
,
he
really
*NL*
liked
people
.
He
almost
liked
common
workmen
.
He
wanted
them
to
be
well
*NL*
paid
,
and
able
to
afford
high
rents
--
though
,
naturally
,
they
must
*NL*
not
interfere
with
the
reasonable
profits
of
stockholders
.
Thus
nobly
*NL*
endowed
,
and
keyed
high
by
the
discovery
that
he
was
a
natural
orator
,
*NL*
he
was
popular
with
audiences
,
and
he
raged
through
the
campaign
,
*NL*
renowned
not
only
in
the
Seventh
and
Eighth
Wards
but
even
in
parts
of
*NL*
the
Sixteenth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Crowded
in
his
car
,
they
came
driving
up
to
Turnverein
Hall
,
South
*NL*
Zenith
--
Babbitt
,
his
wife
,
Verona
,
Ted
,
and
Paul
and
Zilla
Riesling
.
The
*NL*
hall
was
over
a
delicatessen
shop
,
in
a
street
banging
with
trolleys
and
*NL*
smelling
of
onions
and
gasoline
and
fried
fish
.
A
new
appreciation
of
*NL*
Babbitt
filled
all
of
them
,
including
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
how
you
keep
it
up
,
talking
to
three
bunches
in
one
evening
.
*NL*
Wish
I
had
your
strength
,
''
said
Paul
;
and
Ted
exclaimed
to
Verona
,
``
The
*NL*
old
man
certainly
does
know
how
to
kid
these
roughnecks
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Men
in
black
sateen
shirts
,
their
faces
new-washed
but
with
a
hint
of
*NL*
grime
under
their
eyes
,
were
loitering
on
the
broad
stairs
up
to
*NL*
the
hall
.
Babbitt
's
party
politely
edged
through
them
and
into
the
*NL*
whitewashed
room
,
at
the
front
of
which
was
a
dais
with
a
red-plush
*NL*
throne
and
a
pine
altar
painted
watery
blue
,
as
used
nightly
by
the
*NL*
Grand
Masters
and
Supreme
Potentates
of
innumerable
lodges
.
The
hall
*NL*
was
full
.
As
Babbitt
pushed
through
the
fringe
standing
at
the
back
,
he
*NL*
heard
the
precious
tribute
,
``
That
's
him
!
''
The
chairman
bustled
down
the
*NL*
center
aisle
with
an
impressive
,
``
The
speaker
?
All
ready
,
sir
!
Uh
--
let
's
*NL*
see
--
what
was
the
name
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Babbitt
slid
into
a
sea
of
eloquence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
Sixteenth
Ward
,
there
is
one
who
can
not

a
man

whom
there
is
no
more
stalwart

the
political
arena

I
refer
to
our
leader
,
the
Honorable
Lucas

standard-bearer
of
the
city

one
who

brought
up
to
the
blessings

poverty

of
manual
labor

has
,
even
when
Fate
condemned
him
to
sit
*NL*
at
a
desk
,
yet
never
forgotten
how
it
feels

by
heck
,
to
be
up
at
*NL*
five-thirty
and
at
the
factory
with
the
ole
dinner-pail
in
his
hardened
*NL*
mitt
when
the
whistle
blew
at

sneaked

*NL*
patient
,
bleached
,
stooped
carpenters

cheered
him
;
and
*NL*
when
he
worked
up
to
his
anecdote
of
Lincoln
their
eyes
were
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Modestly
,
busily
,
he
hurried
out
of
the
hall
on
delicious
applause
,
and
*NL*
sped
off
to
his
third
audience
of
the
evening
.
``
Ted
,
you
better
drive

*NL*
he
said
.
``
Kind
of
all

after
that
spiel

Well

Paul

how
'd
it
go

Did

Mrs.
Babbitt
worshiped
,
``
Oh
,
it
was
fine
!
So
clear
and
interesting
,
and
*NL*
such
nice
ideas
.
When
I
hear
you
orating
I
realize
I
do
n't
appreciate
*NL*
how
profoundly
you
think
and
what
a
splendid
brain
and
vocabulary
you
*NL*
have
.
Just
--
splendid

But
Verona
was
irritating
.
``
Dad

she
worried
,
*NL*
``
how
do
you
know
that
public
ownership
of
utilities
and
so
on
and
so
*NL*
forth
will
always
be
a
failure

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
reproved
,
``
Rone
,
I
should
think
you
could
see
and
realize
*NL*
that
when
your
father
's
all
worn
out
with
orating
,
it
's
no
time
to
*NL*
expect
him
to
explain
these
complicated
subjects

I
'm
sure
when
he
's
*NL*
rested
he
'll
be
glad
to
explain
it
to
you

Now
let
's
all
be
quiet
and
*NL*
give
Papa
a
chance
to
get
ready
for
his
next
speech

Mr.
Lucas
Prout
and
Sound
Business
defeated
Mr.
Seneca
Doane
and
Class
*NL*
Rule
,
and
Zenith
was
again
saved
.
Babbitt
was
offered
several
minor
*NL*
appointments
to
distribute
among
poor
relations
,
but
he
preferred
*NL*
advance
information
about
the
extension
of
paved
highways
,
and
this
a
*NL*
grateful
administration
gave
to
him
.
Also
,
he
was
one
of
only
nineteen
*NL*
speakers
at
the
dinner
with
which
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
celebrated
the
*NL*
victory
of
righteousness

*NL*
*NL*
His
reputation
for
oratory
established
,
at
the
dinner
of
the
Zenith
Real
*NL*
Estate
Board
he
made
the
Annual
Address
.
The
Advocate-Times
reported
*NL*
this
speech
with
unusual
fullness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
livest
banquets
that
has
recently
been
pulled
off
occurred
*NL*
last
night
in
the
annual
Get-Together
Fest
of
the
Zenith
Real
Estate
*NL*
Board
,
held
in
the
Venetian
Ball
Room
of
the
O'Hearn
House
.
Mine
host
*NL*
Gil
O'Hearn
had
as
usual
done
himself
proud
and
those
assembled
feasted
*NL*
on
such
an
assemblage
of
plates
as
could
be
rivaled
nowhere
west
of
New
*NL*
York
,
if
there
,
and
washed
down
the
plenteous
feed
with
the
cup
which
*NL*
inspired
but
did
not
inebriate
in
the
shape
of
cider
from
the
farm
*NL*
of
Chandler
Mott
,
president
of
the
board
and
who
acted
as
witty
and
*NL*
efficient
chairman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
Mr.
Mott
was
suffering
from
slight
infection
and
sore
throat
,
G.
*NL*
F.
Babbitt
made
the
principal
talk
.
Besides
outlining
the
progress
of
*NL*
Torrensing
real
estate
titles
,
Mr.
Babbitt
spoke
in
part
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
rising
to
address
you
,
with
my
impromptu
speech
carefully
tucked
*NL*
into
my
vest
pocket
,
I
am
reminded
of
the
story
of
the
two
Irishmen
,
*NL*
Mike
and
Pat
,
who
were
riding
on
the
Pullman
.
Both
of
them
,
I
forgot
to
*NL*
say
,
were
sailors
in
the
Navy
.
It
seems
Mike
had
the
lower
berth
and
by
*NL*
and
by
he
heard
a
terrible
racket
from
the
upper
,
and
when
he
yelled
up
*NL*
to
find
out
what
the
trouble
was
,
Pat
answered
,
``
Shure
an
'
bedad
an
'
how
*NL*
can
I
ever
get
a
night
's
sleep
at
all
,
at
all
?
I
been
trying
to
get
into
*NL*
this
darned
little
hammock
ever
since
eight
bells
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Now
,
gentlemen
,
standing
up
here
before
you
,
I
feel
a
good
deal
like
*NL*
Pat
,
and
maybe
after
I
've
spieled
along
for
a
while
,
I
may
feel
so
darn
*NL*
small
that
I
'll
be
able
to
crawl
into
a
Pullman
hammock
with
no
trouble
*NL*
at
all
,
at
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Gentlemen
,
it
strikes
me
that
each
year
at
this
annual
occasion
when
*NL*
friend
and
foe
get
together
and
lay
down
the
battle-ax
and
let
the
waves
*NL*
of
good-fellowship
waft
them
up
the
flowery
slopes
of
amity
,
it
*NL*
behooves
us
,
standing
together
eye
to
eye
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
*NL*
fellow-citizens
of
the
best
city
in
the
world
,
to
consider
where
we
are
*NL*
both
as
regards
ourselves
and
the
common
weal
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
is
true
that
even
with
our
361,000
,
or
practically
362,000
,
*NL*
population
,
there
are
,
by
the
last
census
,
almost
a
score
of
larger
*NL*
cities
in
the
United
States
.
But
,
gentlemen
,
if
by
the
next
census
we
do
*NL*
not
stand
at
least
tenth
,
then
I
'll
be
the
first
to
request
any
knocker
*NL*
to
remove
my
shirt
and
to
eat
the
same
,
with
the
compliments
of
G.
*NL*
F.
Babbitt
,
Esquire
!
It
may
be
true
that
New
York
,
Chicago
,
and
*NL*
Philadelphia
will
continue
to
keep
ahead
of
us
in
size
.
But
aside
from
*NL*
these
three
cities
,
which
are
notoriously
so
overgrown
that
no
decent
*NL*
white
man
,
nobody
who
loves
his
wife
and
kiddies
and
God
's
good
*NL*
out-o'doors
and
likes
to
shake
the
hand
of
his
neighbor
in
greeting
,
*NL*
would
want
to
live
in
them
--
and
let
me
tell
you
right
here
and
now
,
I
*NL*
would
n't
trade
a
high-class
Zenith
acreage
development
for
the
whole
*NL*
length
and
breadth
of
Broadway
or
State
Street
!
--
aside
from
these
three
,
*NL*
it
's
evident
to
any
one
with
a
head
for
facts
that
Zenith
is
the
finest
*NL*
example
of
American
life
and
prosperity
to
be
found
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
we
're
perfect
.
We
've
got
a
lot
to
do
in
the
way
*NL*
of
extending
the
paving
of
motor
boulevards
,
for
,
believe
me
,
it
's
the
*NL*
fellow
with
four
to
ten
thousand
a
year
,
say
,
and
an
automobile
and
a
*NL*
nice
little
family
in
a
bungalow
on
the
edge
of
town
,
that
makes
the
*NL*
wheels
of
progress
go
round
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
That
's
the
type
of
fellow
that
's
ruling
America
to-day
;
in
fact
,
it
's
*NL*
the
ideal
type
to
which
the
entire
world
must
tend
,
if
there
's
to
be
a
*NL*
decent
,
well-balanced
,
Christian
,
go-ahead
future
for
this
little
old
*NL*
planet
!
Once
in
a
while
I
just
naturally
sit
back
and
size
up
this
Solid
*NL*
American
Citizen
,
with
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Our
Ideal
Citizen
--
I
picture
him
first
and
foremost
as
being
busier
*NL*
than
a
bird-dog
,
not
wasting
a
lot
of
good
time
in
day-dreaming
or
going
*NL*
to
sassiety
teas
or
kicking
about
things
that
are
none
of
his
business
,
*NL*
but
putting
the
zip
into
some
store
or
profession
or
art
.
At
night
he
*NL*
lights
up
a
good
cigar
,
and
climbs
into
the
little
old
`
bus
,
and
maybe
*NL*
cusses
the
carburetor
,
and
shoots
out
home
.
He
mows
the
lawn
,
or
sneaks
*NL*
in
some
practice
putting
,
and
then
he
's
ready
for
dinner
.
After
dinner
*NL*
he
tells
the
kiddies
a
story
,
or
takes
the
family
to
the
movies
,
or
*NL*
plays
a
few
fists
of
bridge
,
or
reads
the
evening
paper
,
and
a
*NL*
chapter
or
two
of
some
good
lively
Western
novel
if
he
has
a
taste
for
*NL*
literature
,
and
maybe
the
folks
next-door
drop
in
and
they
sit
and
visit
*NL*
about
their
friends
and
the
topics
of
the
day
.
Then
he
goes
happily
to
*NL*
bed
,
his
conscience
clear
,
having
contributed
his
mite
to
the
prosperity
*NL*
of
the
city
and
to
his
own
bank-account
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
politics
and
religion
this
Sane
Citizen
is
the
canniest
man
on
*NL*
earth
;
and
in
the
arts
he
invariably
has
a
natural
taste
which
makes
him
*NL*
pick
out
the
best
,
every
time
.
In
no
country
in
the
world
will
you
find
*NL*
so
many
reproductions
of
the
Old
Masters
and
of
well-known
paintings
on
*NL*
parlor
walls
as
in
these
United
States
.
No
country
has
anything
like
our
*NL*
number
of
phonographs
,
with
not
only
dance
records
and
comic
but
also
*NL*
the
best
operas
,
such
as
Verdi
,
rendered
by
the
world
's
highest-paid
*NL*
singers
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
In
other
countries
,
art
and
literature
are
left
to
a
lot
of
shabby
*NL*
bums
living
in
attics
and
feeding
on
booze
and
spaghetti
,
but
in
America
*NL*
the
successful
writer
or
picture-painter
is
indistinguishable
from
any
*NL*
other
decent
business
man
;
and
I
,
for
one
,
am
only
too
glad
that
the
man
*NL*
who
has
the
rare
skill
to
season
his
message
with
interesting
reading
*NL*
matter
and
who
shows
both
purpose
and
pep
in
handling
his
literary
wares
*NL*
has
a
chance
to
drag
down
his
fifty
thousand
bucks
a
year
,
to
mingle
*NL*
with
the
biggest
executives
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
,
and
to
show
*NL*
as
big
a
house
and
as
swell
a
car
as
any
Captain
of
Industry
!
But
,
mind
*NL*
you
,
it
's
the
appreciation
of
the
Regular
Guy
who
I
have
been
depicting
*NL*
which
has
made
this
possible
,
and
you
got
to
hand
as
much
credit
to
him
*NL*
as
to
the
authors
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Finally
,
but
most
important
,
our
Standardized
Citizen
,
even
if
he
is
a
*NL*
bachelor
,
is
a
lover
of
the
Little
Ones
,
a
supporter
of
the
hearthstone
*NL*
which
is
the
basic
foundation
of
our
civilization
,
first
,
last
,
and
*NL*
all
the
time
,
and
the
thing
that
most
distinguishes
us
from
the
decayed
*NL*
nations
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
have
never
yet
toured
Europe
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
that
I
care
to
such
an
awful
lot
,
as
long
as
there
's
our
own
mighty
*NL*
cities
and
mountains
to
be
seen
--
but
,
the
way
I
figure
it
out
,
there
*NL*
must
be
a
good
many
of
our
own
sort
of
folks
abroad
.
Indeed
,
one
of
*NL*
the
most
enthusiastic
Rotarians
I
ever
met
boosted
the
tenets
of
*NL*
one-hundred-per-cent
pep
in
a
burr
that
smacked
o
'
bonny
Scutlond
*NL*
and
all
ye
bonny
braes
o
'
Bobby
Burns
.
But
same
time
,
one
thing
that
*NL*
distinguishes
us
from
our
good
brothers
,
the
hustlers
over
there
,
is
*NL*
that
they
're
willing
to
take
a
lot
off
the
snobs
and
journalists
and
*NL*
politicians
,
while
the
modern
American
business
man
knows
how
to
talk
*NL*
right
up
for
himself
,
knows
how
to
make
it
good
and
plenty
clear
that
*NL*
he
intends
to
run
the
works
.
He
does
n't
have
to
call
in
some
highbrow
*NL*
hired-man
when
it
's
necessary
for
him
to
answer
the
crooked
critics
*NL*
of
the
sane
and
efficient
life
.
He
's
not
dumb
,
like
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
merchant
.
He
's
got
a
vocabulary
and
a
punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
With
all
modesty
,
I
want
to
stand
up
here
as
a
representative
*NL*
business
man
and
gently
whisper
,
``
Here
's
our
kind
of
folks
!
Here
's
the
*NL*
specifications
of
the
Standardized
American
Citizen
!
Here
's
the
new
*NL*
generation
of
Americans
:
fellows
with
hair
on
their
chests
and
smiles
*NL*
in
their
eyes
and
adding-machines
in
their
offices
.
We
're
not
doing
any
*NL*
boasting
,
but
we
like
ourselves
first-rate
,
and
if
you
do
n't
like
us
,
*NL*
look
out
--
better
get
under
cover
before
the
cyclone
hits
town

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
So
!
In
my
clumsy
way
I
have
tried
to
sketch
the
Real
He-man
,
the
*NL*
fellow
with
Zip
and
Bang
.
And
it
's
because
Zenith
has
so
large
a
*NL*
proportion
of
such
men
that
it
's
the
most
stable
,
the
greatest
of
our
*NL*
cities
.
New
York
also
has
its
thousands
of
Real
Folks
,
but
New
York
is
*NL*
cursed
with
unnumbered
foreigners
.
So
are
Chicago
and
San
Francisco
.
*NL*
Oh
,
we
have
a
golden
roster
of
cities
--
Detroit
and
Cleveland
with
their
*NL*
renowned
factories
,
Cincinnati
with
its
great
machine-tool
and
soap
*NL*
products
,
Pittsburg
and
Birmingham
with
their
steel
,
Kansas
City
and
*NL*
Minneapolis
and
Omaha
that
open
their
bountiful
gates
on
the
bosom
*NL*
of
the
ocean-like
wheatlands
,
and
countless
other
magnificent
*NL*
sister-cities
,
for
,
by
the
last
census
,
there
were
no
less
than
*NL*
sixty-eight
glorious
American
burgs
with
a
population
of
over
one
*NL*
hundred
thousand
!
And
all
these
cities
stand
together
for
power
and
*NL*
purity
,
and
against
foreign
ideas
and
communism
--
Atlanta
with
Hartford
,
*NL*
Rochester
with
Denver
,
Milwaukee
with
Indianapolis
,
Los
Angeles
with
*NL*
Scranton
,
Portland
,
Maine
,
with
Portland
,
Oregon
.
A
good
live
wire
from
*NL*
Baltimore
or
Seattle
or
Duluth
is
the
twin-brother
of
every
like
fellow
*NL*
booster
from
Buffalo
or
Akron
,
Fort
Worth
or
Oskaloosa

But
it
's
here
in
Zenith

the
home
for
manly
men

womanly
women

bright
kids
,
that
you
find
the
largest
proportion

these
Regular
Guys

that
's
what
sets
it
in

class

itself

remembered

Some
time
I
hope
folks
will
quit
handing
all
the
credit
to
a
lot
of
*NL*
moth-eaten
,
mildewed
,
out-of-date
,
old
,
European
dumps

and
give
proper
*NL*
credit
to
the
famous
Zenith
spirit
,
that
clean
fighting
determination
*NL*
to
win
Success
that
has
made
the
little
old
Zip
City
celebrated
in
*NL*
every
land
and
clime
,
wherever
condensed
milk
and
pasteboard
cartons
*NL*
are
known
!
Believe
me
,
the
world
has
fallen
too
long
for
these
worn-out
*NL*
countries
that
are
n't
producing
anything
but
bootblacks
and
scenery
and
*NL*
booze
,
that
have
n't
got
one
bathroom
per
hundred
people
,
and
that
do
n't
*NL*
know
a
loose-leaf
ledger
from
a
slip-cover
;
and
it
's
just
about
time
for
*NL*
some
Zenithite
to
get
his
back
up
and
holler
for
a
show-down
!

*NL*
''
'
I
tell
you
,
Zenith
and
her
sister-cities
are
producing
a
new
type
of
*NL*
civilization
.
There
are
many
resemblances
between
Zenith
and
these
other
*NL*
burgs
,
and
I
'm
darn
glad
of
it
!
The
extraordinary
,
growing
,
and
sane
*NL*
standardization
of
stores
,
offices
,
streets
,
hotels
,
clothes
,
and
*NL*
newspapers
throughout
the
United
States
shows
how
strong
and
enduring
a
*NL*
type
is
ours
.

*NL*
''
'
I
always
like
to
remember
a
piece
that
Chum
Frink
wrote
for
the
*NL*
newspapers
about
his
lecture-tours
.
It
is
doubtless
familiar
to
many
of
*NL*
you
,
but
if
you
will
permit
me
,
I
'll
take
a
chance
and
read
it
.
It
's
*NL*
one
of
the
classic
poems
,
like
``
If
''
by
Kipling
,
or
Ella
Wheeler
Wilcox
's
*NL*
``
The
Man
Worth
While
''
;
and
I
always
carry
this
clipping
of
it
in
my
*NL*
note-book
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
am
out
upon
the
road
,
a
poet
with
a
pedler
's
load
I
mostly
sing
*NL*
a
hearty
song
,
and
take
a
chew
and
hike
along
,
a-handing
out
my
samples
*NL*
fine
of
Cheero
Brand
of
sweet
sunshine
,
and
peddling
optimistic
pokes
*NL*
and
stable
lines
of
japes
and
jokes
to
Lyceums
and
other
folks
,
to
*NL*
Rotarys
,
Kiwanis
'
Clubs
,
and
feel
I
ai
n't
like
other
dubs
.
And
then
old
*NL*
Major
Silas
Satan
,
a
brainy
cuss
who
's
always
waitin
'
,
he
gives
his
tail
*NL*
a
lively
quirk
,
and
gets
in
quick
his
dirty
work
.
He
fills
me
up
with
*NL*
mullygrubs
;
my
hair
the
backward
way
he
rubs
;
he
makes
me
lonelier
than
*NL*
a
hound
,
on
Sunday
when
the
folks
ai
n't
round
.
And
then
b
'
gosh
,
I
would
*NL*
prefer
to
never
be
a
lecturer
,
a-ridin
'
round
in
classy
cars
and
smoking
*NL*
fifty-cent
cigars
,
and
never
more
I
want
to
roam
;
I
simply
want
to
be
*NL*
back
home
,
a-eatin
'
flap
jacks
,
hash
,
and
ham
,
with
folks
who
savvy
whom
*NL*
I
am
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
when
I
get
that
lonely
spell
,
I
simply
seek
the
best
hotel
,
no
*NL*
matter
in
what
town
I
be
--
St.
Paul
,
Toledo
,
or
K.C.
,
in
Washington
,
*NL*
Schenectady
,
in
Louisville
or
Albany
.
And
at
that
inn
it
hits
my
dome
*NL*
that
I
again
am
right
at
home
.
If
I
should
stand
a
lengthy
spell
in
*NL*
front
of
that
first-class
hotel
,
that
to
the
drummers
loves
to
cater
,
*NL*
across
from
some
big
film
theayter
;
if
I
should
look
around
and
buzz
,
*NL*
and
wonder
in
what
town
I
was
,
I
swear
that
I
could
never
tell
!
For
all
*NL*
the
crowd
would
be
so
swell
,
in
just
the
same
fine
sort
of
jeans
they
*NL*
wear
at
home
,
and
all
the
queens
with
spiffy
bonnets
on
their
beans
,
and
*NL*
all
the
fellows
standing
round
a-talkin
'
always
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
the
same
*NL*
good
jolly
kind
of
guff
,
`
bout
autos
,
politics
and
stuff
and
baseball
*NL*
players
of
renown
that
Nice
Guys
talk
in
my
home
town
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
when
I
entered
that
hotel
,
I
'd
look
around
and
say
,
``
Well
,
well
!
''
*NL*
For
there
would
be
the
same
news-stand
,
same
magazines
and
candies
*NL*
grand
,
same
smokes
of
famous
standard
brand
,
I
'd
find
at
home
,
I
'll
*NL*
tell
!
And
when
I
saw
the
jolly
bunch
come
waltzing
in
for
eats
at
lunch
,
*NL*
and
squaring
up
in
natty
duds
to
platters
large
of
French
Fried
spuds
,
*NL*
why
then
I
'd
stand
right
up
and
bawl
,
``
I
've
never
left
my
home
at
all
!
''
*NL*
And
all
replete
I
'd
sit
me
down
beside
some
guy
in
derby
brown
upon
a
*NL*
lobby
chair
of
plush
,
and
murmur
to
him
in
a
rush
,
``
Hello

Bill
,
tell
*NL*
me

good
old

how

Then
we

be
off

So
when
Sam
Satan
*NL*
makes
you
blue

that
's
what
I
'd
up
and
do
,
for
in
these

you
roam

you
never
leave
your
home

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
sir
,
these
other
burgs
are
our
true
partners
in
the
great
game
*NL*
of
vital
living
.
But
let
's
not
have
any
mistake
about
this
.
I
claim
that
*NL*
Zenith
is
the
best
partner
and
the
fastest-growing
partner
of
the
whole
*NL*
caboodle
.
I
trust
I
may
be
pardoned
if
I
give
a
few
statistics
to
back
*NL*
up
my
claims
.
If
they
are
old
stuff
to
any
of
you
,
yet
the
tidings
of
*NL*
prosperity
,
like
the
good
news
of
the
Bible
,
never
become
tedious
to
the
*NL*
ears
of
a
real
hustler
,
no
matter
how
oft
the
sweet
story
is
told
!
Every
*NL*
intelligent
person
knows
that
Zenith
manufactures
more
condensed
milk
*NL*
and
evaporated
cream
,
more
paper
boxes
,
and
more
lighting-fixtures
,
than
*NL*
any
other
city
in
the
United
States
,
if
not
in
the
world
.
But
it
is
not
*NL*
so
universally
known
that
we
also
stand
second
in
the
manufacture
of
*NL*
package-butter
,
sixth
in
the
giant
realm
of
motors
and
automobiles
,
*NL*
and
somewhere
about
third
in
cheese
,
leather
findings
,
tar
roofing
,
*NL*
breakfast
food
,
and
overalls
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Our
greatness
,
however
,
lies
not
alone
in
punchful
prosperity
but
*NL*
equally
in
that
public
spirit
,
that
forward-looking
idealism
and
*NL*
brotherhood
,
which
has
marked
Zenith
ever
since
its
foundation
by
the
*NL*
Fathers
.
We
have
a
right
,
indeed
we
have
a
duty
toward
our
fair
city
,
*NL*
to
announce
broadcast
the
facts
about
our
high
schools
,
characterized
by
*NL*
their
complete
plants
and
the
finest
school-ventilating
systems
in
*NL*
the
country
,
bar
none
;
our
magnificent
new
hotels
and
banks
and
the
*NL*
paintings
and
carved
marble
in
their
lobbies
;
and
the
Second
National
*NL*
Tower
,
the
second
highest
business
building
in
any
inland
city
in
the
*NL*
entire
country
.
When
I
add
that
we
have
an
unparalleled
number
of
miles
*NL*
of
paved
streets
,
bathrooms
vacuum
cleaners
,
and
all
the
other
signs
*NL*
of
civilization
;
that
our
library
and
art
museum
are
well
supported
and
*NL*
housed
in
convenient
and
roomy
buildings
;
that
our
park-system
is
more
*NL*
than
up
to
par
,
with
its
handsome
driveways
adorned
with
grass
,
*NL*
shrubs
,
and
statuary
,
then
I
give
but
a
hint
of
the
all
round
unlimited
*NL*
greatness
of
Zenith
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
believe
,
however
,
in
keeping
the
best
to
the
last
.
When
I
remind
you
*NL*
that
we
have
one
motor
car
for
every
five
and
seven-eighths
persons
in
*NL*
the
city
,
then
I
give
a
rock-ribbed
practical
indication
of
the
kind
of
*NL*
progress
and
braininess
which
is
synonymous
with
the
name
Zenith
!
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
But
the
way
of
the
righteous
is
not
all
roses
.
Before
I
close
I
must
*NL*
call
your
attention
to
a
problem
we
have
to
face
,
this
coming
year
.
The
*NL*
worst
menace
to
sound
government
is
not
the
avowed
socialists
but
a
*NL*
lot
of
cowards
who
work
under
cover
--
the
long-haired
gentry
who
*NL*
call
themselves
``
liberals
''
and
``
radicals
''
and
``
non-partisan
''
and
*NL*
``
intelligentsia
''
and
God
only
knows
how
many
other
trick
names
!
*NL*
Irresponsible
teachers
and
professors
constitute
the
worst
of
this
whole
*NL*
gang
,
and
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
several
of
them
are
on
the
faculty
of
*NL*
our
great
State
University
!
The
U.
is
my
own
Alma
Mater
,
and
I
am
proud
*NL*
to
be
known
as
an
alumni
,
but
there
are
certain
instructors
there
who
*NL*
seem
to
think
we
ought
to
turn
the
conduct
of
the
nation
over
to
hoboes
*NL*
and
roustabouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Those
profs
are
the
snakes
to
be
scotched
--
they
and
all
their
*NL*
milk-and-water
ilk
!
The
American
business
man
is
generous
to
a
*NL*
fault
.
But
one
thing
he
does
demand
of
all
teachers
and
lecturers
and
*NL*
journalists
:
if
we
're
going
to
pay
them
our
good
money
,
they
've
got
*NL*
to
help
us
by
selling
efficiency
and
whooping
it
up
for
rational
*NL*
prosperity
!
And
when
it
comes
to
these
blab-mouth
,
fault-finding
,
*NL*
pessimistic
,
cynical
University
teachers
,
let
me
tell
you
that
during
*NL*
this
golden
coming
year
it
's
just
as
much
our
duty
to
bring
influence
to
*NL*
have
those
cusses
fired
as
it
is
to
sell
all
the
real
estate
and
gather
*NL*
in
all
the
good
shekels
we
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Not
till
that
is
done
will
our
sons
and
daughters
see
that
the
ideal
*NL*
of
American
manhood
and
culture
is
n't
a
lot
of
cranks
sitting
around
*NL*
chewing
the
rag
about
their
Rights

their
Wrongs

*NL*
Babbitt
promised
to
become
a
recognized
orator
.
He
entertained
a
Smoker
*NL*
of
the
Men
's
Club
of
the
Chatham
Road
presbyterian
Church
with
Irish
,
*NL*
Jewish

dialect
stories
.

But
in
nothing
was
he
more
clearly
revealed
as
the
Prominent
Citizen
*NL*
than
in
his
lecture
on
``
Brass
Tacks

as
delivered
*NL*
before
the
class
in

*NL*
*NL*
The
Advocate-Times
reported
the
lecture
so
fully
that
Vergil

said

to
Babbitt
,
``

*NL*
``

Babbitt
feebly
,
but
at
this
tribute
*NL*
from
Gunch
,
himself
a
man
of
no
mean
oratorical
fame
,
he
expanded
with
*NL*
delight
and
wondered
how

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
HIS
march
to
greatness
was
not
without
disastrous
stumbling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fame
did
not
bring
the
social
advancement
which
the
Babbitts
deserved
.
*NL*
They
were
not
asked
to
join
the
Tonawanda
Country
Club
nor
invited
to
*NL*
the
dances
at
the
Union
.
Himself
,
Babbitt
fretted
,
he
did
n't
``
care
a
fat
*NL*
hoot
for
all
these
highrollers
,
but
the
wife
would
kind
of
like
to
be
*NL*
Among
Those
Present

''
He
nervously
awaited
his
university
class-dinner
*NL*
and
an
evening
of
furious
intimacy
with
such
social
leaders
as
Charles
*NL*
McKelvey
the
millionaire
contractor
,
Max
Kruger
the
banker
,
Irving
Tate
*NL*
the
tool-manufacturer
,
and
Adelbert
Dobson
the
fashionable
interior
*NL*
decorator
.
Theoretically
he
was
their
friend
,
as
he
had
been
in
college
,
*NL*
and
when
he
encountered
them
they
still
called
him
``
Georgie
,
''
but
he
*NL*
did
n't
seem
to
encounter
them
often
,
and
they
never
invited
him
to
*NL*
dinner
-LRB-
with
champagne
and
a
butler
-RRB-
at
their
houses
on
Royal
Ridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
week
before
the
class-dinner
he
thought
of
them
.
``
No
reason

should
n't
become

II

spiritual
outpourings
,
the
*NL*
dinner
of
the
men
of
the
Class
of
1896
was
thoroughly
organized
.
The
*NL*
dinner-committee
hammered
like
a
sales-corporation
.
Once
a
week
they
*NL*
sent
out
reminders
:

's
work
up
some
real
genuine
enthusiasm
and
all
boost
*NL*
together
for
the
snappiest
dinner
yet
!
Elegant
eats
,
short
ginger-talks
,
*NL*
and
memories
shared
together
of
the
brightest
,
gladdest
days
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
held
in
a
private
room
at
the
Union
Club
.
The
club
was
*NL*
a
dingy
building
,
three
pretentious
old
dwellings
knocked
together
,
and
*NL*
the
entrance-hall
resembled
a
potato
cellar
,
yet
the
Babbitt
who
*NL*
was
free
of
the
magnificence
of
the
Athletic
Club
entered
with
*NL*
embarrassment
.
He
nodded
to
the
doorman
,
an
ancient
proud
negro
with
*NL*
brass
buttons
and
a
blue
tail-coat
,
and
paraded
through
the
hall
,
trying
*NL*
to
look
like
a
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sixty
men
had
come
to
the
dinner
.
They
made
islands
and
eddies
in
*NL*
the
hall
;
they
packed
the
elevator
and
the
corners
of
the
private
*NL*
dining-room
.
They
tried
to
be
intimate
and
enthusiastic
.
They
appeared
*NL*
to
one
another
exactly
as
they
had
in
college
--
as
raw
youngsters
whose
*NL*
present
mustaches
,
baldnesses
,
paunches
,
and
wrinkles
were
but
jovial
*NL*
disguises
put
on
for
the
evening
.
``
You
have
n't
changed
a
particle
!
''
*NL*
they
marveled
.
The
men
whom
they
could
not
recall
they
addressed
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
great
to
see
you
again
,
old
man
.
What
are
you
--
Still
doing
the
*NL*
same
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
was
always
starting
a
cheer
or
a
college
song
,
and
it
was
*NL*
always
thinning
into
silence
.
Despite
their
resolution
to
be
democratic
*NL*
they
divided
into
two
sets
:
the
men
with
dress-clothes
and
the
men
*NL*
without
.
Babbitt
-LRB-
extremely
in
dress-clothes
-RRB-
went
from
one
group
to
the
*NL*
other
.
Though
he
was
,
almost
frankly
,
out
for
social
conquest
,
he
sought
*NL*
Paul
Riesling
first
.
He
found
him
alone
,
neat
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
sighed
,
``
I
'm
no
good
at
this
handshaking
and
`
well
,
look
who
's
*NL*
here
'
bunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rats
now
,
Paulibus
,
loosen
up
and
be
a
mixer
!
Finest
bunch
of
boys
on
*NL*
earth
!
Say
,
you
seem
kind
of
glum
.
What
's
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
usual
.
Run-in
with
Zilla
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
!
Let
's
wade
in
and
forget
our
troubles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
Paul
beside
him
,
but
worked
toward
the
spot
where
Charles
*NL*
McKelvey
stood
warming
his
admirers
like
a
furnace
.
*NL*
*NL*
McKelvey
had
been
the
hero
of
the
Class
of
'
96
;
not
only
football
*NL*
captain
and
hammer-thrower
but
debater
,
and
passable
in
what
the
State
*NL*
University
considered
scholarship
.
He
had
gone
on
,
had
captured
the
*NL*
construction-company
once
owned
by
the
Dodsworths
,
best-known
pioneer
*NL*
family
of
Zenith
.
He
built
state
capitols
,
skyscrapers
,
railway
*NL*
terminals
.
He
was
a
heavy-shouldered
,
big-chested
man
,
but
not
sluggish
.
*NL*
There
was
a
quiet
humor
in
his
eyes
,
a
syrup-smooth
quickness
in
his
*NL*
speech
,
which
intimidated
politicians
and
warned
reporters
;
and
in
his
*NL*
presence
the
most
intelligent
scientist
or
the
most
sensitive
artist
*NL*
felt
thin-blooded
,
unworldly
,
and
a
little
shabby
.
He
was
,
particularly
*NL*
when
he
was
influencing
legislatures
or
hiring
labor-spies
,
very
easy
*NL*
and
lovable
and
gorgeous
.
He
was
baronial
;
he
was
a
peer
in
the
rapidly
*NL*
crystallizing
American
aristocracy
,
inferior
only
to
the
haughty
Old
*NL*
Families
.
-LRB-
In
Zenith
,
an
Old
Family
is
one
which
came
to
town
before
*NL*
1840
.
-RRB-
His
power
was
the
greater
because
he
was
not
hindered
by
*NL*
scruples
,
by
either
the
vice
or
the
virtue
of
the
older
Puritan
*NL*
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
McKelvey
was
being
placidly
merry
now
with
the
great
,
the
manufacturers
*NL*
and
bankers
,
the
land-owners
and
lawyers
and
surgeons
who
had
chauffeurs
*NL*
and
went
to
Europe
.
Babbitt
squeezed
among
them
.
He
liked
McKelvey
's
*NL*
smile
as
much
as
the
social
advancement
to
be
had
from
his
favor
.
If
in
*NL*
Paul
's
company
he
felt
ponderous
and
protective
,
with
McKelvey
he
felt
*NL*
slight
and
adoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
McKelvey
say
to
Max
Kruger
,
the
banker
,
``
Yes
,
we
'll
put
up
Sir
*NL*
Gerald
Doak
.
''
Babbitt
's
democratic
love
for
titles
became
a
rich
relish
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
he
's
one
of
the
biggest
iron-men
in
England
,
Max
.
Horribly
*NL*
well-off
...
Why
,
hello
,
old
Georgie
!
Say
,
Max
,
George
Babbitt
is
*NL*
getting
fatter
than
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chairman
shouted
,
``
Take
your
seats
,
fellows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
make
a
move
,
Charley
?
''
Babbitt
said
casually
to
McKelvey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
.
Hello
,
Paul
!
How
's
the
old
fiddler
?
Planning
to
sit
anywhere
*NL*
special
,
George
?
Come
on
,
let
's
grab
some
seats
.
Come
on
,
Max
.
Georgie
,
*NL*
I
read
about
your
speeches
in
the
campaign
.
Bully
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
Babbitt
would
have
followed
him
through
fire
.
He
was
*NL*
enormously
busy
during
the
dinner
,
now
bumblingly
cheering
Paul
,
now
*NL*
approaching
McKelvey
with
``
Hear
,
you
're
going
to
build
some
piers
in
*NL*
Brooklyn
,
''
now
noting
how
enviously
the
failures
of
the
class
,
sitting
*NL*
by
themselves
in
a
weedy
group
,
looked
up
to
him
in
his
association
with
*NL*
the
nobility
,
now
warming
himself
in
the
Society
Talk
of
McKelvey
and
*NL*
Max
Kruger
.
They
spoke
of
a
``
jungle
dance
''
for
which
Mona
Dodsworth
*NL*
had
decorated
her
house
with
thousands
of
orchids
.
They
spoke
,
with
an
*NL*
excellent
imitation
of
casualness
,
of
a
dinner
in
Washington
at
*NL*
which
McKelvey
had
met
a
Senator
,
a
Balkan
princess
,
and
an
English
*NL*
major-general
.
McKelvey
called
the
princess
``
Jenny
,
''
and
let
it
be
known
*NL*
that
he
had
danced
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
thrilled
,
but
not
so
weighted
with
awe
as
to
be
silent
.
If
*NL*
he
was
not
invited
by
them
to
dinner
,
he
was
yet
accustomed
to
talking
*NL*
with
bank-presidents
,
congressmen
,
and
clubwomen
who
entertained
poets
.
*NL*
He
was
bright
and
referential
with
McKelvey
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Charley
,
juh
remember
in
Junior
year
how
we
chartered
a
sea-going
*NL*
hack
and
chased
down
to
Riverdale
,
to
the
big
show
Madame
Brown
used
to
*NL*
put
on
?
Remember
how
you
beat
up
that
hick
constabule
that
tried
to
run
*NL*
us
in
,
and
we
pinched
the
pants-pressing
sign
and
took
and
hung
it
on
*NL*
Prof.
Morrison
's
door
?
Oh
,
gosh
,
those
were
the
days
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
,
McKelvey
agreed
,
were
the
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
reached
``
It
is
n't
the
books
you
study
in
college
but
the
*NL*
friendships
you
make
that
counts
''
when
the
men
at
head
of
the
table
*NL*
broke
into
song
.
He
attacked
McKelvey
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
shame
,
uh
,
shame
to
drift
apart
because
our
,
uh
,
business
*NL*
activities
lie
in
different
fields
.
I
've
enjoyed
talking
over
the
good
*NL*
old
days
.
You
and
Mrs.
McKelvey
must
come
to
dinner
some
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vaguely
,
``
Yes
,
indeed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
to
talk
to
you
about
the
growth
of
real
estate
out
beyond
your
*NL*
Grantsville
warehouse
.
I
might
be
able
to
tip
you
off
to
a
thing
or
two
,
*NL*
possibly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
We
must
have
dinner
together
,
Georgie
.
Just
let
me
know
.
And
*NL*
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
have
your
wife
and
you
at
the
house
,
''
*NL*
said
McKelvey
,
much
less
vaguely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
chairman
's
voice
,
that
prodigious
voice
which
once
had
roused
*NL*
them
to
cheer
defiance
at
rooters
from
Ohio
or
Michigan
or
Indiana
,
*NL*
whooped
,
``
Come
on
,
you
wombats
!
All
together
in
the
long
yell
!
''
Babbitt
*NL*
felt
that
life
would
never
be
sweeter
than
now
,
when
he
joined
with
Paul
*NL*
Riesling
and
the
newly
recovered
hero
,
McKelvey
,
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
Baaaaaattle-ax
Get
an
ax
,
Bal-ax
,
Get-nax
,
Who
,
who
?
The
U.
!
Hooroo
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
Babbitts
invited
the
McKelveys
to
dinner
,
in
early
December
,
and
the
*NL*
McKelveys
not
only
accepted
but
,
after
changing
the
date
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
actually
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Babbitts
somewhat
thoroughly
discussed
the
details
of
the
dinner
,
*NL*
from
the
purchase
of
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
the
number
of
salted
*NL*
almonds
to
be
placed
before
each
person
.
Especially
did
they
mention
the
*NL*
matter
of
the
other
guests
.
To
the
last
Babbitt
held
out
for
giving
*NL*
Paul
Riesling
the
benefit
of
being
with
the
McKelveys
.
``
Good
old
Charley
*NL*
would
like
Paul
and
Verg
Gunch
better
than
some
highfalutin
'
Willy
*NL*
boy
,
''
he
insisted
,
but
Mrs.
Babbitt
interrupted
his
observations
with
,
*NL*
``
Yes
--
perhaps
--
I
think
I
'll
try
to
get
some
Lynnhaven
oysters
,
''
and
*NL*
when
she
was
quite
ready
she
invited
Dr.
J.
T.
Angus
,
the
oculist
,
and
a
*NL*
dismally
respectable
lawyer
named
Maxwell
,
with
their
glittering
wives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Angus
nor
Maxwell
belonged
to
the
Elks
or
to
the
Athletic
Club
;
*NL*
neither
of
them
had
ever
called
Babbitt
``
brother
''
or
asked
his
opinions
*NL*
on
carburetors
.
The
only
``
human
people
''
whom
she
invited
,
Babbitt
*NL*
raged
,
were
the
Littlefields
;
and
Howard
Littlefield
at
times
became
so
*NL*
statistical
that
Babbitt
longed
for
the
refreshment
of
Gunch
's
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
old
lemon-pie-face
,
what
's
the
good
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
lunch
Mrs.
Babbitt
began
to
set
the
table
for
the
*NL*
seven-thirty
dinner
to
the
McKelveys
,
and
Babbitt
was
,
by
order
,
home
at
*NL*
four
.
But
they
did
n't
find
anything
for
him
to
do
,
and
three
times
Mrs.
*NL*
Babbitt
scolded
,
``
Do
please
try
to
keep
out
of
the
way
!
''
He
stood
in
the
*NL*
door
of
the
garage
,
his
lips
drooping
,
and
wished
that
Littlefield
or
*NL*
Sam
Doppelbrau
or
somebody
would
come
along
and
talk
to
him
.
He
saw
Ted
*NL*
sneaking
about
the
corner
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
old
man
?
''
said
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
thin
,
owld
one
?
Gee
,
Ma
certainly
is
on
the
warpath
!
*NL*
I
told
her
Rone
and
I
would
jus
'
soon
not
be
let
in
on
the
fiesta
*NL*
to-night
,
and
she
bit
me
.
She
says
I
got
to
take
a
bath
,
too
.
But
,
say
,
*NL*
the
Babbitt
men
will
be
some
lookers
to-night
!
Little
Theodore
in
a
*NL*
dress-suit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Babbitt
men
!
''
Babbitt
liked
the
sound
of
it
.
He
put
his
arm
about
*NL*
the
boy
's
shoulder
.
He
wished
that
Paul
Riesling
had
a
daughter
,
so
that
*NL*
Ted
might
marry
her
.
``
Yes
,
your
mother
is
kind
of
rouncing
round
,
all
*NL*
right
,
''
he
said
,
and
they
laughed
together
,
and
sighed
together
,
and
*NL*
dutifully
went
in
to
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
McKelveys
were
less
than
fifteen
minutes
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
hoped
that
the
Doppelbraus
would
see
the
McKelveys
'
limousine
,
*NL*
and
their
uniformed
chauffeur
,
waiting
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
well
cooked
and
incredibly
plentiful
,
and
Mrs.
Babbitt
*NL*
had
brought
out
her
grandmother
's
silver
candlesticks
.
Babbitt
worked
*NL*
hard
.
He
was
good
.
He
told
none
of
the
jokes
he
wanted
to
tell
.
He
*NL*
listened
to
the
others
.
He
started
Maxwell
off
with
a
resounding
,
``
Let
's
*NL*
hear
about
your
trip
to
the
Yellowstone
.
''
He
was
laudatory
,
extremely
*NL*
laudatory
.
He
found
opportunities
to
remark
that
Dr.
Angus
was
a
*NL*
benefactor
to
humanity
,
Maxwell
and
Howard
Littlefield
profound
*NL*
scholars
,
Charles
McKelvey
an
inspiration
to
ambitious
youth
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
McKelvey
an
adornment
to
the
social
circles
of
Zenith
,
Washington
,
New
*NL*
York
,
Paris
,
and
numbers
of
other
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
could
not
stir
them
.
It
was
a
dinner
without
a
soul
.
For
no
*NL*
reason
that
was
clear
to
Babbitt
,
heaviness
was
over
them
and
they
spoke
*NL*
laboriously
and
unwillingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
concentrated
on
Lucille
McKelvey
,
carefully
not
looking
at
her
*NL*
blanched
lovely
shoulder
and
the
tawny
silken
bared
which
supported
her
*NL*
frock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
'll
be
going
to
Europe
pretty
soon
again
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
he
*NL*
invited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
awfully
to
run
over
to
Rome
for
a
few
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
see
a
lot
of
pictures
and
music
and
curios
and
everything
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
what
I
really
go
for
is
:
there
's
a
little
trattoria
on
the
Via
*NL*
della
Scrofa
where
you
get
the
best
fettuccine
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
--
Yes
.
That
must
be
nice
to
try
that
.
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
to
ten
McKelvey
discovered
with
profound
regret
that
his
*NL*
wife
had
a
headache
.
He
said
blithely
,
as
Babbitt
helped
him
with
his

``
We
must
lunch
together
some
time

and
talk
over
the
old
days

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
others
had
labored
out
,
at
half-past
ten
,
Babbitt
turned
to
*NL*
his
wife
,
pleading
,
``
Charley
said
he
had
a
corking
time
and
we
must
*NL*
lunch
--
said
they
wanted
to
have
us
up
to
the
house
for
dinner
before
*NL*
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
achieved
,
``
Oh
,
it
's
just
been
one
of
those
quiet
evenings
that
are
*NL*
often
so
much
more
enjoyable
than
noisy
parties
where
everybody
talks
at
*NL*
once
and
does
n't
really
settle
down
to-nice
quiet
enjoyment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
from
his
cot
on
the
sleeping-porch
he
heard
her
weeping
,
slowly
,
*NL*
without
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
month
they
watched
the
social
columns
,
and
waited
for
a
return
*NL*
dinner-invitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
hosts
of
Sir
Gerald
Doak
,
the
McKelveys
were
headlined
all
the
*NL*
week
after
the
Babbitts
'
dinner
.
Zenith
ardently
received
Sir
Gerald
*NL*
-LRB-
who
had
come
to
America
to
buy
coal
-RRB-
.
The
newspapers
interviewed
him
*NL*
on
prohibition
,
Ireland
,
unemployment
,
naval
aviation
,
the
rate
of
*NL*
exchange
,
tea-drinking
versus
whisky-drinking
,
the
psychology
of
*NL*
American
women
,
and
daily
life
as
lived
by
English
county
families
.
Sir
*NL*
Gerald
seemed
to
have
heard
of
all
those
topics
.
The
McKelveys
gave
him
*NL*
a
Singhalese
dinner
,
and
Miss
Elnora
Pearl
Bates
,
society
editor
of
the
*NL*
Advocate-Times
,
rose
to
her
highest
lark-note
.
Babbitt
read
aloud
at
*NL*
breakfast-table
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Twixt
the
original
and
Oriental
decorations
,
the
strange
and
delicious
*NL*
food
,
and
the
personalities
both
of
the
distinguished
guests
,
the
*NL*
charming
hostess
and
the
noted
host
,
never
has
Zenith
seen
a
more
*NL*
recherche
affair
than
the
Ceylon
dinner-dance
given
last
evening
by
Mr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Charles
McKelvey
to
Sir
Gerald
Doak
.
Methought
as
we
--
fortunate
*NL*
one
!
--
were
privileged
to
view
that
fairy
and
foreign
scene
,
nothing
at
*NL*
Monte
Carlo
or
the
choicest
ambassadorial
sets
of
foreign
capitals
could
*NL*
be
more
lovely
.
It
is
not
for
nothing
that
Zenith
is
in
matters
social
*NL*
rapidly
becoming
known
as
the
choosiest
inland
city
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
is
too
modest
to
admit
it
,
Lord
Doak
gives
a
cachet
to
our
*NL*
smart
quartier
such
as
it
has
not
received
since
the
ever-memorable
*NL*
visit
of
the
Earl
of
Sittingbourne
.
Not
only
is
he
of
the
British
*NL*
peerage
,
but
he
is
also
,
on
dit
,
a
leader
of
the
British
metal
*NL*
industries
.
As
he
comes
from
Nottingham
,
a
favorite
haunt
of
Robin
Hood
,
*NL*
though
now
,
we
are
informed
by
Lord
Doak
,
a
live
modern
city
of
275,573
*NL*
inhabitants
,
and
important
lace
as
well
as
other
industries
,
we
like
to
*NL*
think
that
perhaps
through
his
veins
runs
some
of
the
blood
,
both
virile
*NL*
red
and
bonny
blue
,
of
that
earlier
lord
o
'
the
good
greenwood
,
the
*NL*
roguish
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovely
Mrs.
McKelvey
never
was
more
fascinating
than
last
evening
*NL*
in
her
black
net
gown
relieved
by
dainty
bands
of
silver
and
at
her
*NL*
exquisite
waist
a
glowing
cluster
of
Aaron
Ward
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
said
bravely
,
``
I
hope
they
do
n't
invite
us
to
meet
this
Lord
*NL*
Doak
guy
.
Darn
sight
rather
just
have
a
nice
quiet
little
dinner
with
*NL*
Charley
and
the
Missus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Zenith
Athletic
Club
they
discussed
it
amply
.
``
I
s
`
pose
we
'll
*NL*
have
to
call
McKelvey
`
Lord
Chaz
'
from
now
on
,
''
said
Sidney
Finkelstein
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
beats
all
get-out
,
''
meditated
that
man
of
data
,
Howard
Littlefield
,
*NL*
``
how
hard
it
is
for
some
people
to
get
things
straight
.
Here
they
call
*NL*
this
fellow
`
Lord
Doak
'
when
it
ought
to
be
`
Sir
Gerald
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
marvelled
,
``
Is
that
a
fact
!
Well
,
well
!
`
Sir
Gerald
,
'
eh
?
That
's
*NL*
what
you
call
um
,
eh
?
Well
,
sir
,
I
'm
glad
to
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
he
informed
his
salesmen
,
``
It
's
funnier
'n
a
goat
the
way
*NL*
some
folks
that
,
just
because
they
happen
to
lay
up
a
big
wad
,
go
*NL*
entertaining
famous
foreigners
,
do
n't
have
any
more
idea
'n
a
rabbit
how
*NL*
to
address
'em
so
's
to
make
'em
feel
at
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
as
he
was
driving
home
,
he
passed
McKelvey
's
limousine
*NL*
and
saw
Sir
Gerald
,
a
large
,
ruddy
,
pop-eyed
,
Teutonic
Englishman
whose
*NL*
dribble
of
yellow
mustache
gave
him
an
aspect
sad
and
doubtful
.
Babbitt
*NL*
drove
on
slowly
,
oppressed
by
futility
.
He
had
a
sudden
,
unexplained
,
*NL*
and
horrible
conviction
that
the
McKelveys
were
laughing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
betrayed
his
depression
by
the
violence
with
which
he
informed
his
*NL*
wife
,
``
Folks
that
really
tend
to
business
have
n't
got
the
time
to
waste
*NL*
on
a
bunch
like
the
McKelveys
.
This
society
stuff
is
like
any
other
*NL*
hobby
;
if
you
devote
yourself
to
it
,
you
get
on
.
But
I
like
to
have
a
*NL*
chance
to
visit
with
you
and
the
children
instead
of
all
this
idiotic
*NL*
chasing
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
speak
of
the
McKelveys
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
shame
,
at
this
worried
time
,
to
have
to
think
about
the
*NL*
Overbrooks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ed
Overbrook
was
a
classmate
of
Babbitt
who
had
been
a
failure
.
He
had
*NL*
a
large
family
and
a
feeble
insurance
business
out
in
the
suburb
of
*NL*
Dorchester
.
He
was
gray
and
thin
and
unimportant
.
He
had
always
been
*NL*
gray
and
thin
and
unimportant
.
He
was
the
person
whom
,
in
any
group
,
*NL*
you
forgot
to
introduce
,
then
introduced
with
extra
enthusiasm
.
He
had
*NL*
admired
Babbitt
's
good-fellowship
in
college
,
had
admired
ever
since
*NL*
his
power
in
real
estate
,
his
beautiful
house
and
wonderful
clothes
.
It
*NL*
pleased
Babbitt
,
though
it
bothered
him
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
.
*NL*
At
the
class-dinner
he
had
seen
poor
Overbrook
,
in
a
shiny
blue
serge
*NL*
business-suit
,
being
diffident
in
a
corner
with
three
other
failures
.
*NL*
He
had
gone
over
and
been
cordial
:
``
Why
,
hello
,
young
Ed
!
I
hear
you
're
*NL*
writing
all
the
insurance
in
Dorchester
now
.
Bully
work
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
recalled
the
good
old
days
when
Overbrook
used
to
write
poetry
.
*NL*
Overbrook
embarrassed
him
by
blurting
,
``
Say
,
Georgie
,
I
hate
to
think
*NL*
of
how
we
been
drifting
apart
.
I
wish
you
and
Mrs.
Babbitt
would
come
to
*NL*
dinner
some
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
boomed
,
``
Fine
!
Sure
!
Just
let
me
know
.
And
the
wife
and
I
want
*NL*
to
have
you
at
the
house
.
''
He
forgot
it
,
but
unfortunately
Ed
Overbrook
*NL*
did
not
.
Repeatedly
he
telephoned
to
Babbitt
,
inviting
him
to
dinner
.
*NL*
``
Might
as
well
go
and
get
it
over
,
''
Babbitt
groaned
to
his
wife
.
``
But
*NL*
do
n't
it
simply
amaze
you
the
way
the
poor
fish
does
n't
know
the
first
*NL*
thing
about
social
etiquette
?
Think
of
him
`
phoning
me
,
instead
of
his
*NL*
wife
sitting
down
and
writing
us
a
regular
bid
!
Well
,
I
guess
*NL*
we
're
stuck
for
it
.
That
's
the
trouble
with
all
this
class-brother
*NL*
hooptedoodle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
accepted
Overbrook
's
next
plaintive
invitation
,
for
an
evening
two
*NL*
weeks
off
.
A
dinner
two
weeks
off
,
even
a
family
dinner
,
never
seems
*NL*
so
appalling
,
till
the
two
weeks
have
astoundingly
disappeared
and
*NL*
one
comes
dismayed
to
the
ambushed
hour
.
They
had
to
change
the
date
,
*NL*
because
of
their
own
dinner
to
the
McKelveys
,
but
at
last
they
gloomily
*NL*
drove
out
to
the
Overbrooks
'
house
in
Dorchester
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
miserable
from
the
beginning
.
The
Overbrooks
had
dinner
at
*NL*
six-thirty
,
while
the
Babbitts
never
dined
before
seven
.
Babbitt
*NL*
permitted
himself
to
be
ten
minutes
late
.
``
Let
's
make
it
as
short
as
*NL*
possible
.
I
think
we
'll
duck
out
quick
.
I
'll
say
I
have
to
be
at
the
*NL*
office
extra
early
to-morrow
,
''
he
planned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Overbrook
house
was
depressing
.
It
was
the
second
story
of
a
wooden
*NL*
two-family
dwelling
;
a
place
of
baby-carriages
,
old
hats
hung
in
*NL*
the
hall
,
cabbage-smell
,
and
a
Family
Bible
on
the
parlor
table
.
Ed
*NL*
Overbrook
and
his
wife
were
as
awkward
and
threadbare
as
usual
,
and
the
*NL*
other
guests
were
two
dreadful
families
whose
names
Babbitt
never
caught
*NL*
and
never
desired
to
catch
.
But
he
was
touched
,
and
disconcerted
,
by
the
*NL*
tactless
way
in
which
Overbrook
praised
him
:
``
We
're
mighty
proud
to
have
*NL*
old
George
here
to-night
!
Of
course
you
've
all
read
about
his
speeches
*NL*
and
oratory
in
the
papers
--
and
the
boy
's
good-looking
,
too
,
eh
?
--
but
*NL*
what
I
always
think
of
is
back
in
college
,
and
what
a
great
old
mixer
he
*NL*
was
,
and
one
of
the
best
swimmers
in
the
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
tried
to
be
jovial
;
he
worked
at
it
;
but
he
could
find
nothing
*NL*
to
interest
him
in
Overbrook
's
timorousness
,
the
blankness
of
the
other
*NL*
guests
,
or
the
drained
stupidity
of
Mrs.
Overbrook
,
with
her
spectacles
,
*NL*
drab
skin
,
and
tight-drawn
hair
.
He
told
his
best
Irish
story
,
but
it
*NL*
sank
like
soggy
cake
.
Most
bleary
moment
of
all
was
when
Mrs.
Overbrook
,
*NL*
peering
out
of
her
fog
of
nursing
eight
children
and
cooking
and
*NL*
scrubbing
,
tried
to
be
conversational
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
go
to
Chicago
and
New
York
right
along
,
Mr.
Babbitt
,
''
she
*NL*
prodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
get
to
Chicago
fairly
often
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
awfully
interesting
.
I
suppose
you
take
in
all
the
*NL*
theaters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
Mrs.
Overbrook
,
thing
that
hits
me
best
is
a
*NL*
great
big
beefsteak
at
a
Dutch
restaurant
in
the
Loop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
nothing
more
to
say
.
Babbitt
was
sorry
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
hope
;
the
dinner
was
a
failure
.
At
ten
,
rousing
out
of
the
stupor
of
*NL*
meaningless
talk
,
he
said
as
cheerily
as
he
could
,
''
`
Fraid
we
got
to
be
*NL*
starting
,
Ed
.
I
've
got
a
fellow
coming
to
see
me
early
to-morrow
.
''
As
*NL*
Overbrook
helped
him
with
his
coat
,
Babbitt
said
,
``
Nice
to
rub
up
on
the
*NL*
old
days
!
We
must
have
lunch
together
,
P.D.Q.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
sighed
,
on
their
drive
home
,
``
It
was
pretty
terrible
.
But
*NL*
how
Mr.
Overbrook
does
admire
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep
.
Poor
cuss
!
Seems
to
think
I
'm
a
little
tin
archangel
,
and
the
*NL*
best-looking
man
in
Zenith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
certainly
not
that
but
--
Oh
,
Georgie
,
you
do
n't
suppose

have
to
invite
them
to
dinner
at
our
house
now

do
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ouch

Gaw
,
I
hope
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here

now

You
did

anything
about

did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Gee
!
No

Honest
,
I
did
n't

Just
made
a
bluff
about
having
him
to

lunch
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
Oh
,
dear
...
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
their
feelings

But
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
how
I
could
stand
another
evening
like
this
one
.
And
suppose
*NL*
somebody
like
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Angus
came
in
when
we
had
the
Overbrooks
*NL*
there
,
and
thought
they
were
friends
of
ours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
they
worried
,
``
We
really
ought
to
invite
Ed
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
poor
devils
!
''
But
as
they
never
saw
the
Overbrooks
,
they
forgot
them
,
*NL*
and
after
a
month
or
two
they
said
,
``
That
really
was
the
best
way
,
just
*NL*
to
let
it
slide

It
would
n't
be
kind
to
THEM
to
have
them
here
.
They
'd
*NL*
feel
so
out
of
place
and
hard-up
in
our
home

They
did
not
speak
of
the
Overbrooks
again

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
certainty
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
accepted
by
the
McKelveys
made
*NL*
Babbitt
feel
guilty
and
a
little
absurd
.
But
he
went
more
regularly
to
*NL*
the
Elks
;
at
a
Chamber
of
Commerce
luncheon
he
was
oratorical
regarding
*NL*
the
wickedness
of
strikes
;
and
again
he
saw
himself
as
a
Prominent
*NL*
Citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
clubs
and
associations
were
food
comfortable
to
his
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
decent
man
in
Zenith
it
was
required
that
he
should
belong
to
*NL*
one
,
preferably
two
or
three
,
of
the
innumerous
``
lodges
''
and
*NL*
prosperity-boosting
lunch-clubs
;
to
the
Rotarians
,
the
Kiwanis
,
or
the
*NL*
Boosters
;
to
the
Oddfellows
,
Moose
,
Masons
,
Red
Men
,
Woodmen
,
Owls
,
*NL*
Eagles
,
Maccabees
,
Knights
of
Pythias
,
Knights
of
Columbus
,
and
other
*NL*
secret
orders
characterized
by
a
high
degree
of
heartiness
,
sound
*NL*
morals
,
and
reverence
for
the
Constitution
.
There
were
four
reasons
for
*NL*
joining
these
orders
:
It
was
the
thing
to
do
.
It
was
good
for
business
,
*NL*
since
lodge-brothers
frequently
became
customers
.
It
gave
to
Americans
*NL*
unable
to
become
Geheimrate
or
Commendatori
such
unctuous
honorifics
as
*NL*
High
Worthy
Recording
Scribe
and
Grand
Hoogow
to
add
to
the
commonplace
*NL*
distinctions
of
Colonel
,
Judge
,
and
Professor
.
And
it
permitted
the
*NL*
swaddled
American
husband
to
stay
away
from
home
for
one
evening
a
week
.
*NL*
The
lodge
was
his
piazza
,
his
pavement
cafe
.
He
could
shoot
pool
and
*NL*
talk
man-talk
and
be
obscene
and
valiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
what
he
called
a
``
joiner
''
for
all
these
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
gold
and
scarlet
banner
of
his
public
achievements
was
the
*NL*
dun
background
of
office-routine
:
leases
,
sales-contracts
,
lists
of
*NL*
properties
to
rent
.
The
evenings
of
oratory
and
committees
and
lodges
*NL*
stimulated
him
like
brandy
,
but
every
morning
he
was
sandy-tongued
.
Week
*NL*
by
week
he
accumulated
nervousness
.
He
was
in
open
disagreement
with
his
*NL*
outside
salesman
,
Stanley
Graff
;
and
once
,
though
her
charms
had
always
*NL*
kept
him
nickeringly
polite
to
her
,
he
snarled
at
Miss
McGoun
for
*NL*
changing
his
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
presence
of
Paul
Riesling
he
relaxed
.
At
least
once
a
week
*NL*
they
fled
from
maturity
.
On
Saturday
they
played
golf
,
jeering
,
``
As
*NL*
a
golfer
,
you
're
a
fine
tennis-player
,
''
or
they
motored
all
Sunday
*NL*
afternoon
,
stopping
at
village
lunchrooms
to
sit
on
high
stools
at
a
*NL*
counter
and
drink
coffee
from
thick
cups
.
Sometimes
Paul
came
over
in
*NL*
the
evening
with
his
violin
,
and
even
Zilla
was
silent
as
the
lonely
man
*NL*
who
had
lost
his
way
and
forever
crept
down
unfamiliar
roads
spun
out
*NL*
his
dark
soul
in
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
gave
Babbitt
more
purification
and
publicity
than
his
labors
for
*NL*
the
Sunday
School
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
church
,
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
,
was
one
of
the
largest
and
*NL*
richest
,
one
of
the
most
oaken
and
velvety
,
in
Zenith
.
The
pastor
was
*NL*
the
Reverend
John
Jennison
Drew
,
M.A.
,
D.D.
,
LL.D
.
-LRB-
The
M.A.
and
the
*NL*
D.D.
were
from
Elbert
University
,
Nebraska
,
the
LL.D
.
from
Waterbury
*NL*
College
,
Oklahoma
.
-RRB-
He
was
eloquent
,
efficient
,
and
versatile
.
He
*NL*
presided
at
meetings
for
the
denunciation
of
unions
or
the
elevation
of
*NL*
domestic
service
,
and
confided
to
the
audiences
that
as
a
poor
boy
he
*NL*
had
carried
newspapers
.
For
the
Saturday
edition
of
the
Evening
Advocate
*NL*
he
wrote
editorials
on
``
The
Manly
Man
's
Religion
''
and
``
The
Dollars
and
*NL*
Sense
Value
of
Christianity
,
''
which
were
printed
in
bold
type
surrounded
*NL*
by
a
wiggly
border
.
He
often
said
that
he
was
``
proud
to
be
known
as
*NL*
primarily
a
business
man
''
and
that
he
certainly
was
not
going
to
``
permit
*NL*
the
old
Satan
to
monopolize
all
the
pep
and
punch
.
''
He
was
a
thin
,
*NL*
rustic-faced
young
man
with
gold
spectacles
and
a
bang
of
dull
brown
*NL*
hair
,
but
when
he
hurled
himself
into
oratory
he
glowed
with
power
.
*NL*
He
admitted
that
he
was
too
much
the
scholar
and
poet
to
imitate
the
*NL*
evangelist
,
Mike
Monday
,
yet
he
had
once
awakened
his
fold
to
new
life
,
*NL*
and
to
larger
collections
,
by
the
challenge
,
``
My
brethren
,
the
real
*NL*
cheap
skate
is
the
man
who
wo
n't
lend
to
the
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
his
church
a
true
community
center
.
It
contained
everything
*NL*
but
a
bar
.
It
had
a
nursery
,
a
Thursday
evening
supper
with
a
short
*NL*
bright
missionary
lecture
afterward
,
a
gymnasium
,
a
fortnightly
*NL*
motion-picture
show
,
a
library
of
technical
books
for
young
*NL*
workmen
--
though
,
unfortunately
,
no
young
workman
ever
entered
the
church
*NL*
except
to
wash
the
windows
or
repair
the
furnace
--
and
a
sewing-circle
*NL*
which
made
short
little
pants
for
the
children
of
the
poor
while
Mrs.
*NL*
Drew
read
aloud
from
earnest
novels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Dr.
Drew
's
theology
was
Presbyterian
,
his
church-building
*NL*
was
gracefully
Episcopalian
.
As
he
said
,
it
had
the
``
most
perdurable
*NL*
features
of
those
noble
ecclesiastical
monuments
of
grand
Old
England
*NL*
which
stand
as
symbols
of
the
eternity
of
faith
,
religious
and
civil
.
''
*NL*
It
was
built
of
cheery
iron-spot
brick
in
an
improved
Gothic
style
,
and
*NL*
the
main
auditorium
had
indirect
lighting
from
electric
globes
in
lavish
*NL*
alabaster
bowls
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
December
morning
when
the
Babbitts
went
to
church
,
Dr.
John
*NL*
Jennison
Drew
was
unusually
eloquent
.
The
crowd
was
immense
.
Ten
brisk
*NL*
young
ushers
,
in
morning
coats
with
white
roses
,
were
bringing
folding
*NL*
chairs
up
from
the
basement
.
There
was
an
impressive
musical
program
,
*NL*
conducted
by
Sheldon
Smeeth
,
educational
director
of
the
Y.M.C.A.
,
*NL*
who
also
sang
the
offertory
.
Babbitt
cared
less
for
this
,
because
some
*NL*
misguided
person
had
taught
young
Mr.
Smeeth
to
smile
,
smile
,
smile
*NL*
while
he
was
singing
,
but
with
all
the
appreciation
of
a
fellow-orator
*NL*
he
admired
Dr.
Drew
's
sermon
.
It
had
the
intellectual
quality
which
*NL*
distinguished
the
Chatham
Road
congregation
from
the
grubby
chapels
on
*NL*
Smith
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
this
abundant
harvest-time
of
all
the
year
,
''
Dr.
Drew
chanted
,
*NL*
``
when
,
though
stormy
the
sky
and
laborious
the
path
to
the
drudging
*NL*
wayfarer
,
yet
the
hovering
and
bodiless
spirit
swoops
back
o'er
all
the
*NL*
labors
and
desires
of
the
past
twelve
months
,
oh
,
then
it
seems
to
*NL*
me
there
sounds
behind
all
our
apparent
failures
the
golden
chorus
of
*NL*
greeting
from
those
passed
happily
on
;
and
lo
!
on
the
dim
horizon
we
*NL*
see
behind
dolorous
clouds
the
mighty
mass
of
mountains
--
mountains
of
*NL*
melody
,
mountains
of
mirth
,
mountains
of
might
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
do
like
a
sermon
with
culture
and
thought
in
it
,
''
meditated
*NL*
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
service
he
was
delighted
when
the
pastor
,
actively
*NL*
shaking
hands
at
the
door
,
twittered
,
``
Oh
,
Brother
Babbitt
,
can
you
wait
*NL*
a
jiffy
?
Want
your
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
doctor
!
You
bet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drop
into
my
office
.
I
think
you
'll
like
the
cigars
there
.
''
Babbitt
did
*NL*
like
the
cigars
.
He
also
liked
the
office
,
which
was
distinguished
from
*NL*
other
offices
only
by
the
spirited
change
of
the
familiar
wall-placard
*NL*
to
``
This
is
the
Lord
's
Busy
Day
.
''
Chum
Frink
came
in
,
then
William
W.
*NL*
Eathorne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Eathorne
was
the
seventy-year-old
president
of
the
First
State
Bank
*NL*
of
Zenith
.
He
still
wore
the
delicate
patches
of
side-whiskers
which
had
*NL*
been
the
uniform
of
bankers
in
1870
.
If
Babbitt
was
envious
of
the
*NL*
Smart
Set
of
the
McKelveys
,
before
William
Washington
Eathorne
he
was
*NL*
reverent
.
Mr.
Eathorne
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
Smart
Set
.
He
was
*NL*
above
it
.
He
was
the
great-grandson
of
one
of
the
five
men
who
founded
*NL*
Zenith
,
in
1792
,
and
he
was
of
the
third
generation
of
bankers
.
He
could
*NL*
examine
credits
,
make
loans
,
promote
or
injure
a
man
's
business
.
In
his
*NL*
presence
Babbitt
breathed
quickly
and
felt
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reverend
Dr.
Drew
bounced
into
the
room
and
flowered
into
speech
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
asked
you
gentlemen
to
stay
so
I
can
put
a
proposition
before
you
.
*NL*
The
Sunday
School
needs
bucking
up
.
It
's
the
fourth
largest
in
Zenith
,
*NL*
but
there
's
no
reason
why
we
should
take
anybody
's
dust
.
We
ought
to
be
*NL*
first
.
I
want
to
request
you
,
if
you
will
,
to
form
a
committee
of
*NL*
advice
and
publicity
for
the
Sunday
School
;
look
it
over
and
make
any
*NL*
suggestions
for
its
betterment
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
see
that
the
press
*NL*
gives
us
some
attention
--
give
the
public
some
really
helpful
and
*NL*
constructive
news
instead
of
all
these
murders
and
divorces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
,
''
said
the
banker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
and
Frink
were
enchanted
to
join
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
had
asked
Babbitt
what
his
religion
was
,
he
would
have
answered
*NL*
in
sonorous
Boosters
'
-
Club
rhetoric
,
``
My
religion
is
to
serve
my
fellow
*NL*
men
,
to
honor
my
brother
as
myself
,
and
to
do
my
bit
to
make
life
*NL*
happier
for
one
and
all
.
''
If
you
had
pressed
him
for
more
detail
,
he
*NL*
would
have
announced
,
``
I
'm
a
member
of
the
Presbyterian
Church
,
and
*NL*
naturally
,
I
accept
its
doctrines
.
''
If
you
had
been
so
brutal
as
to
*NL*
go
on
,
he
would
have
protested
,
``
There
's
no
use
discussing
and
arguing
*NL*
about
religion
;
it
just
stirs
up
bad
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Actually
,
the
content
of
his
theology
was
that
there
was
a
supreme
being
*NL*
who
had
tried
to
make
us
perfect
,
but
presumably
had
failed
;
that
if
*NL*
one
was
a
Good
Man
he
would
go
to
a
place
called
Heaven
-LRB-
Babbitt
*NL*
unconsciously
pictured
it
as
rather
like
an
excellent
hotel
with
a
*NL*
private
garden
-RRB-
,
but
if
one
was
a
Bad
Man
,
that
is
,
if
he
murdered
*NL*
or
committed
burglary
or
used
cocaine
or
had
mistresses
or
sold
*NL*
non-existent
real
estate
,
he
would
be
punished
.
Babbitt
was
uncertain
,
*NL*
however
,
about
what
he
called
``
this
business
of
Hell
.
''
He
explained
*NL*
to
Ted
,
``
Of
course
I
'm
pretty
liberal
;
I
do
n't
exactly
believe
in
a
*NL*
fire-and-brimstone
Hell
.
Stands
to
reason
,
though
,
that
a
fellow
ca
n't
*NL*
get
away
with
all
sorts
of
Vice
and
not
get
nicked
for
it
,
see
how
I
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
theology
he
rarely
pondered
.
The
kernel
of
his
practical
*NL*
religion
was
that
it
was
respectable
,
and
beneficial
to
one
's
business
,
*NL*
to
be
seen
going
to
services
;
that
the
church
kept
the
Worst
Elements
*NL*
from
being
still
worse
;
and
that
the
pastor
's
sermons
,
however
dull
they
*NL*
might
seem
at
the
time
of
taking
,
yet
had
a
voodooistic
power
which
``
did
*NL*
a
fellow
good
--
kept
him
in
touch
with
Higher
Things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
investigations
for
the
Sunday
School
Advisory
Committee
did
*NL*
not
inspire
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
the
Busy
Folks
'
Bible
Class
,
composed
of
mature
men
and
women
*NL*
and
addressed
by
the
old-school
physician
,
Dr.
T.
Atkins
Jordan
,
in
*NL*
a
sparkling
style
comparable
to
that
of
the
more
refined
humorous
*NL*
after-dinner
speakers
,
but
when
he
went
down
to
the
junior
classes
he
*NL*
was
disconcerted
.
He
heard
Sheldon
Smeeth
,
educational
director
of
the
*NL*
Y.M.C.A.
and
leader
of
the
church-choir
,
a
pale
but
strenuous
young
man
*NL*
with
curly
hair
and
a
smile
,
teaching
a
class
of
sixteen-year-old
boys
.
*NL*
Smeeth
lovingly
admonished
them
,
``
Now
,
fellows
,
I
'm
going
to
have
a
*NL*
Heart
to
Heart
Talk
Evening
at
my
house
next
Thursday
.
We
'll
get
off
by
*NL*
ourselves
and
be
frank
about
our
Secret
Worries
.
You
can
just
tell
old
*NL*
Sheldy
anything
,
like
all
the
fellows
do
at
the
Y.
I
'm
going
to
explain
*NL*
frankly
about
the
horrible
practises
a
kiddy
falls
into
unless
he
's
*NL*
guided
by
a
Big
Brother
,
and
about
the
perils
and
glory
of
Sex
.
''
Old
*NL*
Sheldy
beamed
damply
;
the
boys
looked
ashamed
;
and
Babbitt
did
n't
know
*NL*
which
way
to
turn
his
embarrassed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Less
annoying
but
also
much
duller
were
the
minor
classes
which
were
*NL*
being
instructed
in
philosophy
and
Oriental
ethnology
by
earnest
*NL*
spinsters
.
Most
of
them
met
in
the
highly
varnished
Sunday
School
room
,
*NL*
but
there
was
an
overflow
to
the
basement
,
which
was
decorated
with
*NL*
varicose
water-pipes
and
lighted
by
small
windows
high
up
in
the
oozing
*NL*
wall
.
What
Babbitt
saw
,
however
,
was
the
First
Congregational
Church
*NL*
of
Catawba
.
He
was
back
in
the
Sunday
School
of
his
boyhood
.
He
smelled
*NL*
again
that
polite
stuffiness
to
be
found
only
in
church
parlors
;
he
*NL*
recalled
the
case
of
drab
Sunday
School
books
:
``
Hetty
,
a
Humble
*NL*
Heroine
''
and
``
Josephus
,
a
Lad
of
Palestine
;
''
he
thumbed
once
more
the
*NL*
high-colored
text-cards
which
no
boy
wanted
but
no
boy
liked
to
throw
*NL*
away
,
because
they
were
somehow
sacred
;
he
was
tortured
by
the
stumbling
*NL*
rote
of
thirty-five
years
ago
,
as
in
the
vast
Zenith
church
he
listened
*NL*
to
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Edgar
,
you
read
the
next
verse
.
What
does
it
mean
when
it
says
*NL*
it
's
easier
for
a
camel
to
go
through
a
needle
's
eye
?
What
does
this
*NL*
teach
us
?
Clarence
!
Please
do
n't
wiggle
so
!
If
you
had
studied
your
*NL*
lesson
you
would
n't
be
so
fidgety
.
Now
,
Earl
,
what
is
the
lesson
*NL*
Jesus
was
trying
to
teach
his
disciples
?
The
one
thing
I
want
you
*NL*
to
especially
remember
,
boys
,
is
the
words
,
`
With
God
all
things
*NL*
are
possible

Just
think
of
that
always

Clarence

PLEASE
pay

attention

just

With
God
all
things
are
possible

whenever
you
*NL*
feel
discouraged

and
,
Alec
,
will
you
read
the

if
you
'd
pay

attention
you
would
n't
lose
your
place

Babbitt
started
from
his
open-eyed
nap
,
thanked
the
teacher
for
``
the
*NL*
privilege
of
listening
to
her
splendid
teaching
,
''
and
staggered
on
to
*NL*
the
next
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
weeks
of
this
he
had
no
suggestions
whatever
for
the
Reverend
*NL*
Dr.
Drew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
discovered
a
world
of
Sunday
School
journals
,
an
enormous
*NL*
and
busy
domain
of
weeklies
and
monthlies
which
were
as
technical
,
*NL*
as
practical
and
forward-looking
,
as
the
real-estate
columns
or
the
*NL*
shoe-trade
magazines
.
He
bought
half
a
dozen
of
them
at
a
religious
*NL*
book-shop
and
till
after
midnight
he
read
them
and
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
many
lucrative
tips
on
``
Focusing
Appeals
,
''
``
Scouting
for
New
*NL*
Members
,
''
and
``
Getting
Prospects
to
Sign
up
with
the
Sunday
School
.
''
He
*NL*
particularly
liked
the
word
``
prospects
,
''
and
he
was
moved
by
the
rubric
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moral
springs
of
the
community
's
life
lie
deep
in
its
Sunday
*NL*
Schools
--
its
schools
of
religious
instruction
and
inspiration
.
Neglect
*NL*
now
means
loss
of
spiritual
vigor
and
moral
power
in
years
to
come
...
*NL*
Facts
like
the
above
,
followed
by
a
straight-arm
appeal
,
will
reach
*NL*
folks
who
can
never
be
laughed
or
jollied
into
doing
their
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
admitted
,
``
That
's
so
.
I
used
to
skin
out
of
the
ole
Sunday
*NL*
School
at
Catawba
every
chance
I
got
,
but
same
time
,
I
would
n't
be
where
*NL*
I
am
to-day
,
maybe
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
its
training
in
--
in
moral
*NL*
power
.
And
all
about
the
Bible
.
-LRB-
Great
literature
.
Have
to
read
some
of
*NL*
it
again
,
one
of
these
days
-RRB-
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
scientifically
the
Sunday
School
could
be
organized
he
learned
from
*NL*
an
article
in
the
Westminster
Adult
Bible
Class
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
second
vice-president
looks
after
the
fellowship
of
the
class
.
She
*NL*
chooses
a
group
to
help
her
.
These
become
ushers
.
Every
one
who
comes
*NL*
gets
a
glad
hand
.
No
one
goes
away
a
stranger
.
One
member
of
the
group
*NL*
stands
on
the
doorstep
and
invites
passers-by
to
come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
most
of
all
Babbitt
appreciated
the
remarks
by
William
H.
*NL*
Ridgway
in
the
Sunday
School
Times
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
a
Sunday
School
class
without
any
pep
and
get-up-and-go
*NL*
in
it
,
that
is
,
without
interest
,
that
is
uncertain
in
attendance
,
that
*NL*
acts
like
a
fellow
with
the
spring
fever
,
let
old
Dr.
Ridgway
write
you
*NL*
a
prescription
.
Rx
.
Invite
the
Bunch
for
Supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sunday
School
journals
were
as
well
rounded
as
they
were
practical
.
*NL*
They
neglected
none
of
the
arts
.
As
to
music
the
Sunday
School
Times
*NL*
advertised
that
C.
Harold
Lowden
,
``
known
to
thousands
through
his
sacred
*NL*
compositions
,
''
had
written
a
new
masterpiece
,
``
entitled
`
Yearning
for
*NL*
You
.
'
The
poem
,
by
Harry
D.
Kerr
,
is
one
of
the
daintiest
you
could
*NL*
imagine
and
the
music
is
indescribably
beautiful
.
Critics
are
agreed
*NL*
that
it
will
sweep
the
country
.
May
be
made
into
a
charming
sacred
song
*NL*
by
substituting
the
hymn
words
,
'
I
Heard
the
Voice
of
Jesus
Say
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
manual
training
was
adequately
considered
.
Babbitt
noted
an
*NL*
ingenious
way
of
illustrating
the
resurrection
of
Jesus
Christ
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Model
for
Pupils
to
Make
.
Tomb
with
Rolling
Door
.
--
Use
a
square
covered
*NL*
box
turned
upside
down
.
Pull
the
cover
forward
a
little
to
form
a
groove
*NL*
at
the
bottom
.
Cut
a
square
door
,
also
cut
a
circle
of
cardboard
to
more
*NL*
than
cover
the
door
.
Cover
the
circular
door
and
the
tomb
thickly
with
*NL*
stiff
mixture
of
sand
,
flour
and
water
and
let
it
dry
.
It
was
the
heavy
*NL*
circular
stone
over
the
door
the
women
found
`
rolled
away
'
on
Easter
*NL*
morning
.
This
is
the
story
we
are
to
`
Go-tell
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
advertisements
the
Sunday
School
journals
were
thoroughly
*NL*
efficient
.
Babbitt
was
interested
in
a
preparation
which
``
takes
the
*NL*
place
of
exercise
for
sedentary
men
by
building
up
depleted
nerve
*NL*
tissue
,
nourishing
the
brain
and
the
digestive
system
.
''
He
was
edified
*NL*
to
learn
that
the
selling
of
Bibles
was
a
hustling
and
strictly
*NL*
competitive
industry
,
and
as
an
expert
on
hygiene
he
was
pleased
by
the
*NL*
Sanitary
Communion
Outfit
Company
's
announcement
of
``
an
improved
and
*NL*
satisfactory
outfit
throughout
,
including
highly
polished
beautiful
*NL*
mahogany
tray
.
This
tray
eliminates
all
noise
,
is
lighter
and
more
*NL*
easily
handled
than
others
and
is
more
in
keeping
with
the
furniture
of
*NL*
the
church
than
a
tray
of
any
other
material
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
the
pile
of
Sunday
School
journals
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pondered
,
``
Now

there
's
a

I
certainly
hand
it

They

brought

George
F.

that
's
the
answer
to
the

critics

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
are
but
three
or
four
old
houses
in
Floral
Heights
,
and
in
Floral
*NL*
Heights
an
old
house
is
one
which
was
built
before
1880
.
The
largest
of
*NL*
these
is
the
residence
of
William
Washington
Eathorne
,
president
of
the
*NL*
First
State
Bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Eathorne
Mansion
preserves
the
memory
of
the
``
nice
parts
''
of
Zenith
*NL*
as
they
appeared
from
1860
to
1900
.
It
is
a
red
brick
immensity
with
*NL*
gray
sandstone
lintels
and
a
roof
of
slate
in
courses
of
red
,
green
,
and
*NL*
dyspeptic
yellow
.
There
are
two
anemic
towers
,
one
roofed
with
copper
,
*NL*
the
other
crowned
with
castiron
ferns
.
The
porch
is
like
an
open
*NL*
tomb
;
it
is
supported
by
squat
granite
pillars
above
which
hang
frozen
*NL*
cascades
of
brick
.
At
one
side
of
the
house
is
a
huge
stained-glass
*NL*
window
in
the
shape
of
a
keyhole
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
house
has
an
effect
not
at
all
humorous
.
It
embodies
the
heavy
*NL*
dignity
of
those
Victorian
financiers
who
ruled
the
generation
between
*NL*
the
pioneers
and
the
brisk
``
sales-engineers
''
and
created
a
somber
*NL*
oligarchy
by
gaining
control
of
banks
,
mills
,
land
,
railroads
,
mines
.
*NL*
Out
of
the
dozen
contradictory
Zeniths
which
together
make
up
the
*NL*
true
and
complete
Zenith
,
none
is
so
powerful
and
enduring
yet
none
*NL*
so
unfamiliar
to
the
citizens
as
the
small
,
still
,
dry
,
polite
,
cruel
*NL*
Zenith
of
the
William
Eathornes
;
and
for
that
tiny
hierarchy
the
other
*NL*
Zeniths
unwittingly
labor
and
insignificantly
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
castles
of
the
testy
Victorian
tetrarchs
are
gone
now
or
*NL*
decayed
into
boarding-houses
,
but
the
Eathorne
Mansion
remains
virtuous
*NL*
and
aloof
,
reminiscent
of
London
,
Back
Bay
,
Rittenhouse
Square
.
Its
*NL*
marble
steps
are
scrubbed
daily
,
the
brass
plate
is
reverently
polished
,
*NL*
and
the
lace
curtains
are
as
prim
and
superior
as
William
Washington
*NL*
Eathorne
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
certain
awe
Babbitt
and
Chum
Frink
called
on
Eathorne
for
a
*NL*
meeting
of
the
Sunday
School
Advisory
Committee
;
with
uneasy
stillness
*NL*
they
followed
a
uniformed
maid
through
catacombs
of
reception-rooms
to
*NL*
the
library
.
It
was
as
unmistakably
the
library
of
a
solid
old
banker
as
*NL*
Eathorne
's
side-whiskers
were
the
side-whiskers
of
a
solid
old
banker
.
*NL*
The
books
were
most
of
them
Standard
Sets
,
with
the
correct
and
*NL*
traditional
touch
of
dim
blue
,
dim
gold
,
and
glossy
calf-skin
.
The
*NL*
fire
was
exactly
correct
and
traditional
;
a
small
,
quiet
,
steady
fire
,
*NL*
reflected
by
polished
fire-irons
.
The
oak
desk
was
dark
and
old
and
*NL*
altogether
perfect
;
the
chairs
were
gently
supercilious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eathorne
's
inquiries
as
to
the
healths
of
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
Miss
Babbitt
,
*NL*
and
the
Other
Children
were
softly
paternal
,
but
Babbitt
had
nothing
*NL*
with
which
to
answer
him
.
It
was
indecent
to
think
of
using
the
``
How
's
*NL*
tricks
,
ole
socks
?
''
which
gratified
Vergil
Gunch
and
Frink
and
Howard
*NL*
Littlefield
--
men
who
till
now
had
seemed
successful
and
urbane
.
Babbitt
*NL*
and
Frink
sat
politely
,
and
politely
did
Eathorne
observe
,
opening
his
*NL*
thin
lips
just
wide
enough
to
dismiss
the
words
,
``
Gentlemen
,
before
we
*NL*
begin
our
conference
--
you
may
have
felt
the
cold
in
coming
here
--
so
good
*NL*
of
you
to
save
an
old
man
the
journey
--
shall
we
perhaps
have
a
whisky
*NL*
toddy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
well
trained
was
Babbitt
in
all
the
conversation
that
befits
a
Good
*NL*
Fellow
that
he
almost
disgraced
himself
with
``
Rather
than
make
trouble
,
*NL*
and
always
providin
'
there
ai
n't
any
enforcement
officers
hiding
in
*NL*
the
waste-basket
--
''
The
words
died
choking
in
his
throat
.
He
bowed
in
*NL*
flustered
obedience
.
So
did
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eathorne
rang
for
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
modern
and
luxurious
Babbitt
had
never
seen
any
one
ring
for
a
*NL*
servant
in
a
private
house
,
except
during
meals
.
Himself
,
in
hotels
,
had
*NL*
rung
for
bell-boys
,
but
in
the
house
you
did
n't
hurt
Matilda
's
feelings
;
*NL*
you
went
out
in
the
hall
and
shouted
for
her
.
Nor
had
he
,
since
*NL*
prohibition
,
known
any
one
to
be
casual
about
drinking
.
It
was
*NL*
extraordinary
merely
to
sip
his
toddy
and
not
cry
,
``
Oh
,
maaaaan
,
this
*NL*
hits
me
right
where
I
live
!
''
And
always
,
with
the
ecstasy
of
youth
*NL*
meeting
greatness
,
he
marveled
,
``
That
little
fuzzy-face
there
,
why
,
*NL*
he
could
make
me
or
break
me
!
If
he
told
my
banker
to
call
my
loans
--
!
*NL*
Gosh
!
That
quarter-sized
squirt
!
And
looking
like
he
had
n't
got
a
single
*NL*
bit
of
hustle
to
him
!
I
wonder
--
Do
we
Boosters
throw
too
many
fits
about
*NL*
pep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
thought
he
shuddered
away
,
and
listened
devoutly
to
Eathorne
's
*NL*
ideas
on
the
advancement
of
the
Sunday
School
,
which
were
very
clear
and
*NL*
very
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diffidently
Babbitt
outlined
his
own
suggestions
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
if
you
analyze
the
needs
of
the
school
,
in
fact
,
going
right
*NL*
at
it
as
if
it
was
a
merchandizing
problem
,
of
course
the
one
basic
*NL*
and
fundamental
need
is
growth
.
I
presume
we
're
all
agreed
we
wo
n't
be
*NL*
satisfied
till
we
build
up
the
biggest
darn
Sunday
School
in
the
whole
*NL*
state
,
so
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
wo
n't
have
to
take
anything
*NL*
off
anybody
.
Now
about
jazzing
up
the
campaign
for
prospects
:
they
've
*NL*
already
used
contesting
teams
,
and
given
prizes
to
the
kids
that
bring
*NL*
in
the
most
members
.
And
they
made
a
mistake
there
:
the
prizes
were
*NL*
a
lot
of
folderols
and
doodads
like
poetry
books
and
illustrated
*NL*
Testaments
,
instead
of
something
a
real
live
kid
would
want
to
work
for
,
*NL*
like
real
cash
or
a
speedometer
for
his
motor
cycle
.
Course
I
suppose
*NL*
it
's
all
fine
and
dandy
to
illustrate
the
lessons
with
these
decorated
*NL*
book-marks
and
blackboard
drawings
and
so
on
,
but
when
it
comes
down
to
*NL*
real
he-hustling
,
getting
out
and
drumming
up
customers
--
or
members
,
I
*NL*
mean
,
why
,
you
got
to
make
it
worth
a
fellow
's
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
want
to
propose
two
stunts
:
First
,
divide
the
Sunday
School
into
*NL*
four
armies
,
depending
on
age
.
Everybody
gets
a
military
rank
in
his
own
*NL*
army
according
to
how
many
members
he
brings
in
,
and
the
duffers
that
*NL*
lie
down
on
us
and
do
n't
bring
in
any
,
they
remain
privates
.
The
pastor
*NL*
and
superintendent
rank
as
generals
.
And
everybody
has
got
to
give
*NL*
salutes
and
all
the
rest
of
that
junk

feel
it

worth

get
rank

``
Then
,
second
:
Course
the
school
has
its
advertising
committee

,
*NL*
Lord
,
nobody
ever
really
works
good
--
nobody
works
well
just
for
the
love
*NL*
of
it
.
The
thing
to
do
is
to
be
practical
and
up-to-date
,
and
hire
a
*NL*
real
paid
press-agent
for
the
Sunday
School-some
newspaper
fellow
who
*NL*
can
give
part
of
his
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
you
bet
!

said
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
the
nice
juicy
bits
he
could
get
in

Babbitt
crowed

*NL*
``
Not
only
the
big
,
salient
,
vital
facts

about
how
fast
the
Sunday
*NL*
School
--
and
the
collection
--
is
growing
,
but
a
lot
of
humorous
gossip
*NL*
and
kidding
:
about
how
some
blowhard
fell
down
on
his
pledge
to
get
new
*NL*
members
,
or
the
good
time
the
Sacred
Trinity
class
of
girls
had
at
their
*NL*
wieniewurst
party
.
And
on
the
side
,
if
he
had
time
,
the
press-agent
*NL*
might
even
boost
the
lessons
themselves
--
do
a
little
advertising
for
*NL*
all
the
Sunday
Schools
in
town
,
in
fact

No
use
being
hoggish
toward

the
rest
of

providing
we
can
keep
the

Frinstance

he
might
get
the
papers
to

Course
I
have
n't
got
a
literary
*NL*
training
like
Frink
here
,
and
I
'm
just
guessing
how
the
pieces
ought
*NL*
to
be
written
,
but
take
frinstance
,
suppose
the
week
's
lesson
is
about
*NL*
Jacob
;
well
,
the
press-agent
might
get
in
something
that
would
have
*NL*
a
fine
moral
,
and
yet
with
a
trick
headline
that
'd
get
folks
to
read
*NL*
it
--
say
like
:
`
Jake
Fools
the
Old
Man
;
Makes
Getaway
with
Girl
and
*NL*
Bankroll
.
'
See
how
I
mean
?
That
'd
get
their
interest
!
Now
,
course
,
Mr.
*NL*
Eathorne
,
you
're
conservative
,
and
maybe
you
feel
these
stunts
would
be
*NL*
undignified
,
but
honestly
,
I
believe
they
'd
bring
home
the
bacon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eathorne
folded
his
hands
on
his
comfortable
little
belly
and
purred
*NL*
like
an
aged
pussy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
say
,
first
,
that
I
have
been
very
much
pleased
by
your
analysis
*NL*
of
the
situation
,
Mr.
Babbitt
.
As
you
surmise
,
it
's
necessary
in
My
*NL*
Position
to
be
conservative
,
and
perhaps
endeavor
to
maintain
a
certain
*NL*
standard
of
dignity
.
Yet
I
think
you
'll
find
me
somewhat
progressive
.
In
*NL*
our
bank
,
for
example
,
I
hope
I
may
say
that
we
have
as
modern
a
method
*NL*
of
publicity
and
advertising
as
any
in
the
city
.
Yes
,
I
fancy
you
'll
*NL*
find
us
oldsters
quite
cognizant
of
the
shifting
spiritual
values
of
the
*NL*
age
.
Yes
,
oh
yes
.
And
so
,
in
fact
,
it
pleases
me
to
be
able
to
say
*NL*
that
though
personally
I
might
prefer
the
sterner
Presbyterianism
of
an
*NL*
earlier
era

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
finally
gathered
that
Eathorne
was
willing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chum
Frink
suggested
as
part-time
press-agent
one
Kenneth
Escott
,
*NL*
reporter
on
the
Advocate-Times
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
on
a
high
plane
of
amity
and
Christian
helpfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
did
not
drive
home
,
but
toward
the
center
of
the
city
.
He
wished
*NL*
to
be
by
himself
and
exult
over
the
beauty
of
intimacy
with
William

Washington
Eathorne
.

A
snow-blanched
evening
of
ringing

eager
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
golden
lights
of
trolley-cars
sliding
along
the
packed
snow
of
the
*NL*
roadway
.
Demure
lights
of
little
houses
.
The
belching
glare
of
a
distant
*NL*
foundry
,
wiping
out
the
sharp-edged
stars
.
Lights
of
neighborhood
drug
*NL*
stores
where
friends
gossiped
,
well
pleased
,
after
the
day
's
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
green
light
of
a
police-station
,
and
greener
radiance
on
the
snow
;
*NL*
the
drama
of
a
patrol-wagon
--
gong
beating
like
a
terrified
heart
,
*NL*
headlights
scorching
the
crystal-sparkling
street
,
driver
not
a
*NL*
chauffeur
but
a
policeman
proud
in
uniform
,
another
policeman
perilously
*NL*
dangling
on
the
step
at
the
back
,
and
a
glimpse
of
the
prisoner
.
A
*NL*
murderer
,
a
burglar
,
a
coiner
cleverly
trapped
?
*NL*
*NL*
An
enormous
graystone
church
with
a
rigid
spire
;
dim
light
in
the
*NL*
Parlors
,
and
cheerful
droning
of
choir-practise
.
The
quivering
green
*NL*
mercury-vapor
light
of
a
photo-engraver
's
loft
.
Then
the
storming
lights
*NL*
of
down-town
;
parked
cars
with
ruby
tail-lights
;
white
arched
entrances
*NL*
to
movie
theaters
,
like
frosty
mouths
of
winter
caves
;
electric
*NL*
signs
--
serpents
and
little
dancing
men
of
fire
;
pink-shaded
globes
and
*NL*
scarlet
jazz
music
in
a
cheap
up-stairs
dance-hall
;
lights
of
Chinese
*NL*
restaurants
,
lanterns
painted
with
cherry-blossoms
and
with
pagodas
,
*NL*
hung
against
lattices
of
lustrous
gold
and
black
.
Small
dirty
lamps
in
*NL*
small
stinking
lunchrooms
.
The
smart
shopping-district
,
with
rich
and
*NL*
quiet
light
on
crystal
pendants
and
furs
and
suave
surfaces
of
polished
*NL*
wood
in
velvet-hung
reticent
windows
.
High
above
the
street
,
an
*NL*
unexpected
square
hanging
in
the
darkness
,
the
window
of
an
office
where
*NL*
some
one
was
working
late
,
for
a
reason
unknown
and
stimulating
.
A
man
*NL*
meshed
in
bankruptcy
,
an
ambitious
boy
,
an
oil-man
suddenly
become
rich
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
shrewd
,
the
snow
was
deep
in
uncleared
alleys
,
and
beyond
*NL*
the
city
,
Babbitt
knew
,
were
hillsides
of
snow-drift
among
wintry
oaks
,
*NL*
and
the
curving
ice-enchanted
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loved
his
city
with
passionate
wonder
.
He
lost
the
accumulated
*NL*
weariness
of
business
--
worry
and
expansive
oratory
;
he
felt
young
and
*NL*
potential
.
He
was
ambitious
.
It
was
not
enough
to
be
a
Vergil
Gunch
,
*NL*
an
Orville
Jones
.
No
.
``
They
're
bully
fellows
,
simply
lovely
,
but
they
*NL*
have
n't
got
any
finesse

No
.
He
was
going
to
be
an
Eathorne
;
delicately
*NL*
rigorous
,
coldly
powerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
stuff

The
wallop
in

I
organize

of
my

some

?
And
Ted
*NL*
succeed
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drove
happily
home
,
and
to
Mrs.
Babbitt
he
was
a
William
Washington
*NL*
Eathorne
,
but
she
did
not
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Kenneth
Escott
,
reporter
on
the
Advocate-Times
was
appointed
*NL*
press-agent
of
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
Sunday
School
.
He
gave
six
*NL*
hours
a
week
to
it
.
At
least
he
was
paid
for
giving
six
hours
a
week
.
*NL*
He
had
friends
on
the
Press
and
the
Gazette
and
he
was
not
-LRB-
officially
-RRB-
*NL*
known
as
a
press-agent
.
He
procured
a
trickle
of
insinuating
items
*NL*
about
neighborliness
and
the
Bible
,
about
class-suppers
,
jolly
but
*NL*
educational
,
and
the
value
of
the
Prayer-life
in
attaining
financial
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sunday
School
adopted
Babbitt
's
system
of
military
ranks
.
Quickened
*NL*
by
this
spiritual
refreshment
,
it
had
a
boom
.
It
did
not
become
the
*NL*
largest
school
in
Zenith
--
the
Central
Methodist
Church
kept
ahead
of
it
*NL*
by
methods
which
Dr.
Drew
scored
as
``
unfair
,
undignified
,
un-American
,
*NL*
ungentlemanly
,
and
unchristian
''
--
but
it
climbed
from
fourth
place
to
*NL*
second
,
and
there
was
rejoicing
in
heaven
,
or
at
least
in
that
portion
*NL*
of
heaven
included
in
the
parsonage
of
Dr.
Drew
,
while
Babbitt
had
much
*NL*
praise
and
good
repute
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
received
the
rank
of
colonel
on
the
general
staff
of
the
school
.
*NL*
He
was
plumply
pleased
by
salutes
on
the
street
from
unknown
small
*NL*
boys
;
his
ears
were
tickled
to
ruddy
ecstasy
by
hearing
himself
called
*NL*
``
Colonel
;
''
and
if
he
did
not
attend
Sunday
School
merely
to
be
thus
*NL*
exalted
,
certainly
he
thought
about
it
all
the
way
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
particularly
pleasant
to
the
press-agent
,
Kenneth
Escott
;
he
took
*NL*
him
to
lunch
at
the
Athletic
Club
and
had
him
at
the
house
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
many
of
the
cocksure
young
men
who
forage
about
cities
in
apparent
*NL*
contentment
and
who
express
their
cynicism
in
supercilious
slang
,
Escott
*NL*
was
shy
and
lonely
.
His
shrewd
starveling
face
broadened
with
joy
at
*NL*
dinner
,
and
he
blurted
,
``
Gee
whillikins
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
if
you
knew
how
*NL*
good
it
is
to
have
home
eats
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Escott
and
Verona
liked
each
other
.
All
evening
they
``
talked
about
*NL*
ideas
.
''
They
discovered
that
they
were
Radicals
.
True
,
they
were
*NL*
sensible
about
it
.
They
agreed
that
all
communists
were
criminals
;
*NL*
that
this
vers
libre
was
tommy-rot
;
and
that
while
there
ought
to
be
*NL*
universal
disarmament
,
of
course
Great
Britain
and
the
United
States
*NL*
must
,
on
behalf
of
oppressed
small
nations
,
keep
a
navy
equal
to
the
*NL*
tonnage
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
.
But
they
were
so
revolutionary
*NL*
that
they
predicted
-LRB-
to
Babbitt
's
irritation
-RRB-
that
there
would
some
*NL*
day
be
a
Third
Party
which
would
give
trouble
to
the
Republicans
and
*NL*
Democrats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Escott
shook
hands
with
Babbitt
three
times
,
at
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
mentioned
his
extreme
fondness
for
Eathorne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
week
three
newspapers
presented
accounts
of
Babbitt
's
sterling
*NL*
labors
for
religion
,
and
all
of
them
tactfully
mentioned
William
*NL*
Washington
Eathorne
as
his
collaborator
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
had
brought
Babbitt
quite
so
much
credit
at
the
Elks
,
the
*NL*
Athletic
Club
,
and
the
Boosters
'
.
His
friends
had
always
congratulated
*NL*
him
on
his
oratory
,
but
in
their
praise
was
doubt
,
for
even
in
speeches
*NL*
advertising
the
city
there
was
something
highbrow
and
degenerate
,
*NL*
like
writing
poetry
.
But
now
Orville
Jones
shouted
across
the
Athletic
*NL*
dining-room
,
``
Here
's
the
new
director
of
the
First
State
Bank
!
''
Grover
*NL*
Butterbaugh
,
the
eminent
wholesaler
of
plumbers
'
supplies
,
chuckled
,
*NL*
``
Wonder
you
mix
with
common
folks
,
after
holding
Eathorne
's
hand
!
''
And
*NL*
Emil
Wengert
,
the
jeweler
,
was
at
last
willing
to
discuss
buying
a
house
*NL*
in
Dorchester
.

*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Sunday
School
campaign
was
finished
,
Babbitt
suggested
to
*NL*
Kenneth
Escott
,
``
Say
,
how
about
doing
a
little
boosting
for
Doc
Drew
*NL*
personally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Escott
grinned
.
``
You
trust
the
doc
to
do
a
little
boosting
for
himself
,
*NL*
Mr.
Babbitt
!
There
's
hardly
a
week
goes
by
without
his
ringing
up
the
*NL*
paper
to
say
if
we
'll
chase
a
reporter
up
to
his
Study
,
he
'll
let
us
*NL*
in
on
the
story
about
the
swell
sermon
he
's
going
to
preach
on
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
short
skirts
,
or
the
authorship
of
the
Pentateuch
.
Do
n't
*NL*
you
worry
about
him
.
There
's
just
one
better
publicity-grabber
in
town
,
*NL*
and
that
's
this
Dora
Gibson
Tucker
that
runs
the
Child
Welfare
and
the
*NL*
Americanization
League
,
and
the
only
reason
she
's
got
Drew
beaten
is
*NL*
because
she
has
got
SOME
brains
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
Kenneth
,
I
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
talk
that
way
about
the
*NL*
doctor
.
A
preacher
has
to
watch
his
interests
,
has
n't
he
?
You
remember
*NL*
that
in
the
Bible
about
--
about
being
diligent
in
the
Lord
's
business
,
or
*NL*
something
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
I
'll
get
something
in
if
you
want
me
to

Mr.
Babbitt
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
have
to
wait
till
the
managing
editor
is
out
of
town
,
and
then
*NL*
blackjack
the
city
editor

Thus
it
came
to
pass
that
in
the
Sunday
Advocate-Times
,
under
a
picture
*NL*
of
Dr.
Drew
at
his
earnestest
,
with
eyes
alert
,
jaw
as
granite
,
and
*NL*
rustic
lock
flamboyant
,
appeared
an
inscription
--
a
wood-pulp
tablet
*NL*
conferring
twenty-four
hours

immortality
:

*NL*
*NL*
The
Rev.
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
,
M.A.
,
pastor
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
Church
in
lovely
Floral
Heights
,
is
a
wizard
*NL*
soul-winner
.
He
holds
the
local
record
for
conversions
.
During
his
*NL*
shepherdhood
an
average
of
almost
a
hundred
sin-weary
persons
per
year
*NL*
have
declared
their
resolve
to
lead
a
new
life
and
have
found
a
harbor
*NL*
of
refuge
and
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
zips
at
the
Chatham
Road
Church
.
The
subsidiary
organizations
*NL*
are
keyed
to
the
top-notch
of
efficiency
.
Dr.
Drew
is
especially
keen
*NL*
on
good
congregational
singing
.
Bright
cheerful
hymns
are
used
at
every
*NL*
meeting
,
and
the
special
Sing
Services
attract
lovers
of
music
and
*NL*
professionals
from
all
parts
of
the
city

*NL*
On
the
popular
lecture
platform
as

as
in
the
pulpit
Dr.
Drew
is

a
renowned
word-painter
,
and
during

V
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
let
Dr.
Drew
know
that
he
was
responsible
for
this
tribute
.
Dr.
*NL*
Drew
called
him
``
brother
,
''
and
shook
his
hand
a
great
many
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
meetings
of
the
Advisory
Committee
,
Babbitt
had
hinted
that
*NL*
he
would
be
charmed
to
invite
Eathorne
to
dinner
,
but
Eathorne
had
*NL*
murmured
,
``
So
nice
of
you
--
old
man
,
now
--
almost
never
go
out
.
''
Surely
*NL*
Eathorne
would
not
refuse
his
own
pastor
.
Babbitt
said
boyishly
to
Drew
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
doctor
,
now
we
've
put
this
thing
over
,
strikes
me
it
's
up
to
the
*NL*
dominie
to
blow
the
three
of
us
to
a
dinner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bully
!
You
bet
!
Delighted
!
''
cried
Dr.
Drew
,
in
his
manliest
way
.
-LRB-
Some
*NL*
one
had
once
told
him
that
he
talked
like
the
late
President
Roosevelt
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
uh
,
say
,
doctor
,
be
sure
and
get
Mr.
Eathorne
to
come
.
Insist
*NL*
on
it
.
It
's
,
uh
--
I
think
he
sticks
around
home
too
much
for
his
own
*NL*
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eathorne
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
friendly
dinner
.
Babbitt
spoke
gracefully
of
the
stabilizing
*NL*
and
educational
value
of
bankers
to
the
community
.
They
were
,
he
*NL*
said
,
the
pastors
of
the
fold
of
commerce
.
For
the
first
time
Eathorne
*NL*
departed
from
the
topic
of
Sunday
Schools
,
and
asked
Babbitt
about
the
*NL*
progress
of
his
business
.
Babbitt
answered
modestly
,
almost
filially
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
months
later
,
when
he
had
a
chance
to
take
part
in
the
Street
*NL*
Traction
Company
's
terminal
deal
,
Babbitt
did
not
care
to
go
to
his
own
*NL*
bank
for
a
loan
.
It
was
rather
a
quiet
sort
of
deal
and
,
if
it
had
come
*NL*
out
,
the
Public
might
not
have
understood
.
He
went
to
his
friend
Mr.
*NL*
Eathorne
;
he
was
welcomed
,
and
received
the
loan
as
a
private
venture
;
*NL*
and
they
both
profited
in
their
pleasant
new
association
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
Babbitt
went
to
church
regularly
,
except
on
spring
Sunday
*NL*
mornings
which
were
obviously
meant
for
motoring
.
He
announced
to
Ted
,
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
boy
,
there
's
no
stronger
bulwark
of
sound
conservatism
than
*NL*
the
evangelical
church
,
and
no
better
place
to
make
friends
who
'll
*NL*
help
you
to
gain
your
rightful
place
in
the
community
than
in
your
own
*NL*
church-home
!

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THOUGH
he
saw
them
twice
daily
,
though
he
knew
and
amply
discussed
every
*NL*
detail
of
their
expenditures
,
yet
for
weeks
together
Babbitt
was
no
more
*NL*
conscious
of
his
children
than
of
the
buttons
on
his
coat-sleeves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
admiration
of
Kenneth
Escott
made
him
aware
of
Verona
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
become
secretary
to
Mr.
Gruensberg
of
the
Gruensberg
Leather
*NL*
Company
;
she
did
her
work
with
the
thoroughness
of
a
mind
which
reveres
*NL*
details
and
never
quite
understands
them
;
but
she
was
one
of
the
*NL*
people
who
give
an
agitating
impression
of
being
on
the
point
of
doing
*NL*
something
desperate
--
of
leaving
a
job
or
a
husband
--
without
ever
doing
*NL*
it
.
Babbitt
was
so
hopeful
about
Escott
's
hesitant
ardors
that
he
became
*NL*
the
playful
parent
.
When
he
returned
from
the
Elks
he
peered
coyly
into
*NL*
the
living-room
and
gurgled
,
``
Has
our
Kenny
been
here
to-night
?
''
He
*NL*
never
credited
Verona
's
protest
,
``
Why
,
Ken
and
I
are
just
good
friends
,
*NL*
and
we
only
talk
about
Ideas
.
I
wo
n't
have
all
this
sentimental
*NL*
nonsense
,
that
would
spoil
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Ted
who
most
worried
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
conditions
in
Latin
and
English
but
with
a
triumphant
record
in
*NL*
manual
training
,
basket-ball
,
and
the
organization
of
dances
,
Ted
was
*NL*
struggling
through
his
Senior
year
in
the
East
Side
High
School
.
At
home
*NL*
he
was
interested
only
when
he
was
asked
to
trace
some
subtle
ill
in
the
*NL*
ignition
system
of
the
car
.
He
repeated
to
his
tut-tutting
father
that
*NL*
he
did
not
wish
to
go
to
college
or
law-school
,
and
Babbitt
was
equally
*NL*
disturbed
by
this
``
shiftlessness
''
and
by
Ted
's
relations
with
Eunice
*NL*
Littlefield
,
next
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
was
the
daughter
of
Howard
Littlefield
,
that
wrought-iron
*NL*
fact-mill
,
that
horse-faced
priest
of
private
ownership
,
Eunice
was
*NL*
a
midge
in
the
sun
.
She
danced
into
the
house
,
she
flung
herself
into
*NL*
Babbitt
's
lap
when
he
was
reading
,
she
crumpled
his
paper
,
and
laughed
*NL*
at
him
when
he
adequately
explained
that
he
hated
a
crumpled
newspaper
*NL*
as
he
hated
a
broken
sales-contract
.
She
was
seventeen
now
.
Her
ambition
*NL*
was
to
be
a
cinema
actress
.
She
did
not
merely
attend
the
showing
of
*NL*
every
``
feature
film
;
''
she
also
read
the
motion-picture
magazines
,
*NL*
those
extraordinary
symptoms
of
the
Age
of
Pep-monthlies
and
weeklies
*NL*
gorgeously
illustrated
with
portraits
of
young
women
who
had
recently
*NL*
been
manicure
girls
,
not
very
skilful
manicure
girls
,
and
who
,
unless
*NL*
their
every
grimace
had
been
arranged
by
a
director
,
could
not
have
*NL*
acted
in
the
Easter
cantata
of
the
Central
Methodist
Church
;
magazines
*NL*
reporting
,
quite
seriously
,
in
``
interviews
''
plastered
with
pictures
of
*NL*
riding-breeches
and
California
bungalows
,
the
views
on
sculpture
and
*NL*
international
politics
of
blankly
beautiful
,
suspiciously
beautiful
*NL*
young
men
;
outlining
the
plots
of
films
about
pure
prostitutes
and
*NL*
kind-hearted
train-robbers
;
and
giving
directions
for
making
bootblacks
*NL*
into
Celebrated
Scenario
Authors
overnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
authorities
Eunice
studied
.
She
could
,
she
frequently
did
,
tell
*NL*
whether
it
was
in
November
or
December
,
1905
,
that
Mack
Harker
?
the
*NL*
renowned
screen
cowpuncher
and
badman
,
began
his
public
career
as
*NL*
chorus
man
in
``
Oh
,
You
Naughty
Girlie
.
''
On
the
wall
of
her
room
,
her
*NL*
father
reported
,
she
had
pinned
up
twenty-one
photographs
of
actors
.
But
*NL*
the
signed
portrait
of
the
most
graceful
of
the
movie
heroes
she
carried
*NL*
in
her
young
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
bewildered
by
this
worship
of
new
gods
,
and
he
suspected
*NL*
that
Eunice
smoked
cigarettes
.
He
smelled
the
cloying
reek
from
*NL*
up-stairs
,
and
heard
her
giggling
with
Ted
.
He
never
inquired
.
The
*NL*
agreeable
child
dismayed
him
.
Her
thin
and
charming
face
was
sharpened
*NL*
by
bobbed
hair
;
her
skirts
were
short
,
her
stockings
were
rolled
,
and
,
*NL*
as
she
flew
after
Ted
,
above
the
caressing
silk
were
glimpses
of
soft
*NL*
knees
which
made
Babbitt
uneasy
,
and
wretched
that
she
should
consider
*NL*
him
old
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
veiled
life
of
his
dreams
,
when
the
*NL*
fairy
child
came
running
to
him
she
took
on
the
semblance
of
Eunice
*NL*
Littlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ted
was
motor-mad
as
Eunice
was
movie-mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thousand
sarcastic
refusals
did
not
check
his
teasing
for
a
car
of
*NL*
his
own
.
However
lax
he
might
be
about
early
rising
and
the
prosody
of
*NL*
Vergil
,
he
was
tireless
in
tinkering
.
With
three
other
boys
he
bought
a
*NL*
rheumatic
Ford
chassis
,
built
an
amazing
racer-body
out
of
tin
and
pine
,
*NL*
went
skidding
round
corners
in
the
perilous
craft
,
and
sold
it
at
a
*NL*
profit
.
Babbitt
gave
him
a
motor-cycle
,
and
every
Saturday
afternoon
,
*NL*
with
seven
sandwiches
and
a
bottle
of
Coca-Cola
in
his
pockets
,
and
*NL*
Eunice
perched
eerily
on
the
rumble
seat
,
he
went
roaring
off
to
distant
*NL*
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Usually
Eunice
and
he
were
merely
neighborhood
chums
,
and
quarreled
with
*NL*
a
wholesome
and
violent
lack
of
delicacy
;
but
now
and
then
,
after
the
*NL*
color
and
scent
of
a
dance
,
they
were
silent
together
and
a
little
*NL*
furtive
,
and
Babbitt
was
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
an
average
father
.
He
was
affectionate
,
bullying
,
*NL*
opinionated
,
ignorant
,
and
rather
wistful
.
Like
most
parents
,
he
enjoyed
*NL*
the
game
of
waiting
till
the
victim
was
clearly
wrong
,
then
virtuously
*NL*
pouncing
.
He
justified
himself
by
croaking
,
``
Well
,
Ted
's
mother
spoils
*NL*
him
.
Got
to
be
somebody
who
tells
him
what
's
what
,
and
me
,
I
'm
elected
*NL*
the
goat
.
Because
I
try
to
bring
him
up
to
be
a
real
,
decent
,
human
*NL*
being
and
not
one
of
these
sapheads
and
lounge-lizards
,
of
course
they
*NL*
all
call
me
a
grouch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
,
with
the
eternal
human
genius
for
arriving
by
the
worst
*NL*
possible
routes
at
surprisingly
tolerable
goals
,
Babbitt
loved
his
son
*NL*
and
warmed
to
his
companionship
and
would
have
sacrificed
everything
for
*NL*
him
--
if
he
could
have
been
sure
of
proper
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Ted
was
planning
a
party
for
his
set
in
the
Senior
Class
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
meant
to
be
helpful
and
jolly
about
it
.
From
his
memory
of
*NL*
high-school
pleasures
back
in
Catawba
he
suggested
the
nicest
games
:
*NL*
Going
to
Boston
,
and
charades
with
stew-pans
for
helmets
,
and
*NL*
word-games
in
which
you
were
an
Adjective
or
a
Quality
.
When
he
was
most
*NL*
enthusiastic
he
discovered
that
they
were
n't
paying
attention
;
they
were
*NL*
only
tolerating
him
.
As
for
the
party
,
it
was
as
fixed
and
standardized
*NL*
as
a
Union
Club
Hop
.
There
was
to
be
dancing
in
the
living-room
,
a
noble
*NL*
collation
in
the
dining-room
,
and
in
the
hall
two
tables
of
bridge
for
*NL*
what
Ted
called
``
the
poor
old
dumb-bells
that
you
ca
n't
get
to
dance
*NL*
hardly
more
'n
half
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
breakfast
was
monopolized
by
conferences
on
the
affair
.
No
one
*NL*
listened
to
Babbitt
's
bulletins
about
the
February
weather
or
to
his
*NL*
throat-clearing
comments
on
the
headlines
.
He
said
furiously
,
``
If
I
may
*NL*
be
PERMITTED
to
interrupt
your
engrossing
private
CONVERSATION
--
Juh
hear
*NL*
what
I
SAID
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
be
a
spoiled
baby
!
Ted
and
I
have
just
as
much
right
to
talk
*NL*
as
you
have
!
''
flared
Mrs.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
night
of
the
party
he
was
permitted
to
look
on
,
when
he
was
not
*NL*
helping
Matilda
with
the
Vecchia
ice
cream
and
the
petits
fours
.
He
was
*NL*
deeply
disquieted
.
Eight
years
ago
,
when
Verona
had
given
a
high-school
*NL*
party
,
the
children
had
been
featureless
gabies
.
Now
they
were
men
*NL*
and
women
of
the
world
,
very
supercilious
men
and
women
;
the
boys
*NL*
condescended
to
Babbitt
,
they
wore
evening-clothes
,
and
with
hauteur
*NL*
they
accepted
cigarettes
from
silver
cases
.
Babbitt
had
heard
stories
*NL*
of
what
the
Athletic
Club
called
``
goings
on
''
at
young
parties
;
of
*NL*
girls
``
parking
''
their
corsets
in
the
dressing-room
,
of
``
cuddling
''
and
*NL*
``
petting
,
''
and
a
presumable
increase
in
what
was
known
as
Immorality
.
*NL*
To-night
he
believed
the
stories
.
These
children
seemed
bold
to
him
,
and
*NL*
cold
.
The
girls
wore
misty
chiffon
,
coral
velvet
,
or
cloth
of
gold
,
and
*NL*
around
their
dipping
bobbed
hair
were
shining
wreaths
.
He
had
it
,
upon
*NL*
urgent
and
secret
inquiry
,
that
no
corsets
were
known
to
be
parked
*NL*
upstairs
;
but
certainly
these
eager
bodies
were
not
stiff
with
steel
.
*NL*
Their
stockings
were
of
lustrous
silk
,
their
slippers
costly
and
*NL*
unnatural
,
their
lips
carmined
and
their
eyebrows
penciled
.
They
danced
*NL*
cheek
to
cheek
with
the
boys
,
and
Babbitt
sickened
with
apprehension
and
*NL*
unconscious
envy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Worst
of
them
all
was
Eunice
Littlefield
,
and
maddest
of
all
the
boys
*NL*
was
Ted
.
Eunice
was
a
flying
demon
.
She
slid
the
length
of
the
room
;
her
*NL*
tender
shoulders
swayed
;
her
feet
were
deft
as
a
weaver
's
shuttle
;
she
*NL*
laughed
,
and
enticed
Babbitt
to
dance
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
discovered
the
annex
to
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
and
girls
disappeared
occasionally
,
and
he
remembered
rumors
*NL*
of
their
drinking
together
from
hip-pocket
flasks
.
He
tiptoed
round
the
*NL*
house
,
and
in
each
of
the
dozen
cars
waiting
in
the
street
he
saw
the
*NL*
points
of
light
from
cigarettes
,
from
each
of
them
heard
high
giggles
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
denounce
them
but
-LRB-
standing
in
the
snow
,
peering
round
*NL*
the
dark
corner
-RRB-
he
did
not
dare
.
He
tried
to
be
tactful
.
When
he
had
*NL*
returned
to
the
front
hall
he
coaxed
the
boys
,
``
Say
,
if
any
of
you
*NL*
fellows
are
thirsty
,
there
's
some
dandy
ginger
ale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Thanks
!
''
they
condescended
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sought
his
wife
,
in
the
pantry
,
and
exploded
,
``
I
'd
like
to
go
in
*NL*
there
and
throw
some
of
those
young
pups
out
of
the
house
!
They
talk
*NL*
down
to
me
like
I
was
the
butler
!
I
'd
like
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
she
sighed
;
``
only
everybody
says
,
all
the
mothers
tell
me
,
*NL*
unless
you
stand
for
them
,
if
you
get
angry
because
they
go
out
to
their
*NL*
cars
to
have
a
drink
,
they
wo
n't
come
to
your
house
any
more
,
and
we
*NL*
would
n't
want
Ted
left
out

*NL*
*NL*
He
announced
that
he
would
be
enchanted
to
have
Ted
left
out
of
things
,
*NL*
and
hurried
in
to
be
polite
,
lest
Ted
be
left
out
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
he
resolved
,
if
he
found
that
the
boys
were
drinking
,
he
*NL*
would
--
well
,
he
'd
``
hand
'em
something
that
would
surprise
'em
.
''
While
*NL*
he
was
trying
to
be
agreeable
to
large-shouldered
young
bullies
he
was
*NL*
earnestly
sniffing
at
them
Twice
he
caught
the
reek
of
prohibition-time
*NL*
whisky
,
but
then
,
it
was
only
twice
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Howard
Littlefield
lumbered
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
,
in
a
mood
of
solemn
parental
patronage
,
to
look
on
.
Ted
and
*NL*
Eunice
were
dancing
,
moving
together
like
one
body
.
Littlefield
gasped
.
*NL*
He
called
Eunice
.
There
was
a
whispered
duologue
,
and
Littlefield
*NL*
explained
to
Babbitt
that
Eunice
's
mother
had
a
headache
and
needed
her
.
*NL*
She
went
off
in
tears
.
Babbitt
looked
after
them
furiously
.
``
That
little
*NL*
devil
!
Getting
Ted
into
trouble
!
And
Littlefield
,
the
conceited
old
*NL*
gas-bag
,
acting
like
it
was
Ted
that
was
the
bad
influence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
he
smelled
whisky
on
Ted
's
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
civil
farewell
to
the
guests
,
the
row
was
terrific
,
a
thorough
*NL*
Family
Scene
,
like
an
avalanche
,
devastating
and
without
reticences
.
*NL*
Babbitt
thundered
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
wept
,
Ted
was
unconvincingly
defiant
,
*NL*
and
Verona
in
confusion
as
to
whose
side
she
was
taking
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
months
there
was
coolness
between
the
Babbitts
and
the
*NL*
Littlefields
,
each
family
sheltering
their
lamb
from
the
wolf-cub
next
*NL*
door
.
Babbitt
and
Littlefield
still
spoke
in
pontifical
periods
about
*NL*
motors
and
the
senate
,
but
they
kept
bleakly
away
from
mention
of
their
*NL*
families
.
Whenever
Eunice
came
to
the
house
she
discussed
with
pleasant
*NL*
intimacy
the
fact
that
she
had
been
forbidden
to
come
to
the
house
;
and
*NL*
Babbitt
tried
,
with
no
success
whatever
,
to
be
fatherly
and
advisory
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
all
fishhooks
!
''
Ted
wailed
to
Eunice
,
as
they
wolfed
hot
*NL*
chocolate
,
lumps
of
nougat
,
and
an
assortment
of
glace
nuts
,
in
the
*NL*
mosaic
splendor
of
the
Royal
Drug
Store
,
``
it
gets
me
why
Dad
does
n't
*NL*

pass
out
from
being
so
poky

Every
evening
he
sits
there
,
about
*NL*
half-asleep
,
and
if
Rone
or
I
say
,
`
Oh
,
come
on

do
something

he
*NL*
does
n't
even
take
the
trouble
to
think
about
it
.
He
just
yawns
and
says
,

Naw

this
suits
me
right
here

He
does
n't
know
there
's
any
fun

I
suppose
he
must
do
some
thinking

same

I
do

gosh
,
there
's
no

telling

the

playing
a
little
bum
golf
on
Saturday

knows
there
's

anything
in

do

just
keep
sitting
there-sitting
*NL*
there
every
night

not
wanting
to
go
anywhere

not
wanting

If
he
was
frightened
by
Ted
's
slackness
,
Babbitt
was
not
sufficiently
*NL*
frightened
by
Verona
.
She
was
too
safe
.
She
lived
too
much
in
the
neat
*NL*
little
airless
room
of
her
mind
.
Kenneth
Escott
and
she
were
always
*NL*
under
foot
.
When
they
were
not
at
home
,
conducting
their
cautiously
*NL*
radical
courtship
over
sheets
of
statistics
,
they
were
trudging
off
to
*NL*
lectures
by
authors
and
Hindu
philosophers
and
Swedish
lieutenants
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
,
''
Babbitt
wailed
to
his
wife
,
as
they
walked
home
from
the
*NL*
Fogartys

bridge-party
,
``
it
gets
me
how
Rone

They
sit
there
night

whenever

is

they

to
go
out

play
a

*NL*
*NL*
Then
round
the
swimmer
,
bored
by
struggling
through
the
perpetual
surf
*NL*
of
family
life
,
new
combers
swelled

*NL*
Babbitt
's
father
-
and
mother-in-law
,
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Henry
T.
Thompson
,
*NL*
rented
their
old
house
in
the
Bellevue
district
and
moved
to
the
Hotel
*NL*
Hatton
,
that
glorified
boarding-house
filled
with
widows
,
red-plush
*NL*
furniture
,
and
the
sound
of
ice-water
pitchers
.
They
were
lonely
there
,
*NL*
and
every
other
Sunday
evening
the
Babbitts
had
to
dine
with
them
,
on
*NL*
fricasseed
chicken
,
discouraged
celery

and
cornstarch
ice
cream
,
and
*NL*
afterward
sit

polite

restrained
,
in
the
hotel
lounge
,
while
a
young
*NL*
woman
violinist
played
songs
from
the
German
via
Broadway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Babbitt
's
own
mother
came
down
from
Catawba
to
spend
three
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
kind
woman
and
magnificently
uncomprehending
.
She
*NL*
congratulated
the
convention-defying
Verona
on
being
a
``
nice
,
loyal
*NL*
home-body
without
all
these
Ideas
that
so
many
girls
seem
to
have
*NL*
nowadays

''
and
when
Ted
filled
the
differential
with
grease
,
out
of
pure
*NL*
love
of
mechanics
and
filthiness
,
she
rejoiced
that
he
was
``
so
handy
*NL*
around
the
house

and
helping
his
father
and
all
,
and
not
going
out
with
*NL*
the
girls
all
the
time
and
trying
to
pretend
he
was
a
society
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
loved
his
mother
,
and
sometimes
he
rather
liked
her
,
but
he
was
*NL*
annoyed
by
her
Christian
Patience
,
and
he
was
reduced
to
pulpiness
when
*NL*
she
discoursed
about
a
quite
mythical
hero
called
``
Your
Father
''
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
remember
it

I
remember
just
how
you
looked
that
day

with
your
goldy
brown
*NL*
curls

your
lace
collar
,
you
always
were
such
a
dainty
child

*NL*
kind
of
puny
and
sickly
,

you
loved
pretty
things
so
much
and
the
red
*NL*
tassels
on
your
little
bootees
and
all
--
and
Your
Father
was
taking
us
to
*NL*
church
and
a
man
stopped
us
and
said
`
Major
'
--
so
many
of
the
neighbors
*NL*
used
to
call
Your
Father
`
Major
;
'
of
course
he
was
only
a
private
in
The
*NL*
War
but
everybody
knew
that
was
because
of
the
jealousy
of
his
captain

he
ought
to
have
been
a
high-ranking
officer

he
had
that
natural

ability

command
that
so
very

very
few
men
have

this
man
came
*NL*
out
into
the
road
and
held
up
his
hand
and
stopped
the
buggy
and
said
,
*NL*
`
Major

he
said
,
`
there
's
a
lot
of
the
folks
around
here

decided

support
Colonel
Scanell

we
want
you

join

``
Well

the
*NL*
man

Captain
Smith

used

call

heaven
only
knows

why

be
called

`
Captain

or
any
other

Captain

Well

how

this
Smith
knew
it

he
knew
what
a

*NL*
he
was
,
and
he
knew
Your
Father
knew
the
political
situation
from

Z

he
ought
to
have
seen
that
here
was
one
man
he
could
n't
impose
*NL*
on
,

he
went
on
trying
to

hinting

trying

Your

*NL*
spoke
up

said
to
him
,
`
Captain

with
that
he
drove
on

left
the
fellow
standing
there
in

road

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
most
exasperated
when
she
revealed
his
boyhood
to
the
*NL*
children

He
had
,
it
seemed
,
been
fond
of
barley-sugar
;
had
worn
the
*NL*
``
loveliest
little
pink
bow
in
his
curls

and
corrupted
his
own
name
to
*NL*
``
Goo-goo

He
heard
-LRB-
though
he
did
not
officially
hear
-RRB-
Ted
admonishing
*NL*
Tinka
,
``
Come
on
now
,
kid

stick
the
lovely
pink
bow
in

*NL*
beat
it
down

Goo-goo

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
half-brother
,
Martin
,
with
his
wife
and
youngest
baby
,
came
*NL*
down
from
Catawba
for
two
days
.
Martin
bred
cattle
and
ran
the
dusty
*NL*
general-store
.
He
was
proud
of
being
a
freeborn
independent
American
of
*NL*
the
good
old
Yankee
stock
;
he
was
proud
of
being
honest
,
blunt
,
ugly
,
*NL*
and
disagreeable
.
His
favorite
remark
was
``
How
much
did
you
pay
for
*NL*
that
?
''
He
regarded
Verona
's
books
,
Babbitt
's
silver
pencil
,
and
flowers
*NL*
on
the
table
as
citified
extravagances
,
and
said
so
.
Babbitt
would
have
*NL*
quarreled
with
him
but
for
his
gawky
wife
and
the
baby
,
whom
Babbitt
*NL*
teased
and
poked
fingers
at
and
addressed
:

*NL*
``

*NL*
All
the
while
Verona
and
Kenneth
Escott
held
long
inquiries
into
*NL*
epistemology
;
Ted
was
a
disgraced
rebel
;
and
Tinka
,
aged
eleven

was
*NL*
demanding
that

be
allowed
to
go
to
the
movies
thrice
a
week

``

raged

*NL*
He
enjoyed
being
sick
in
February
;
he
was
delighted
by
their
*NL*
consternation
that
he
,
the
rock
,
should
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
eaten
a
questionable
clam

For
two
days
he
was
languorous
and
*NL*
petted
and
esteemed
.
He
was
allowed
to
snarl
``
Oh
,
let
me
alone
!
''
without
*NL*
reprisals
.
He
lay
on
the
sleeping-porch
and
watched
the
winter
sun
slide
*NL*
along
the
taut
curtains
,
turning
their
ruddy
khaki
to
pale
blood
red
.
*NL*
The
shadow
of
the
draw-rope
was
dense
black
,
in
an
enticing
ripple
on
*NL*
the
canvas
.
He
found
pleasure
in
the
curve
of
it
,
sighed
as
the
fading
*NL*
light
blurred
it
.
He
was
conscious
of
life
,
and
a
little
sad
.
With
no
*NL*
Vergil
Gunches
before
whom
to
set
his
face
in
resolute
optimism
,
he
*NL*
beheld
,
and
half
admitted
that
he
beheld
,
his
way
of
life
as
incredibly
*NL*
mechanical
.
Mechanical
business
--
a
brisk
selling
of
badly
built
houses
.
*NL*
Mechanical
religion
--
a
dry
,
hard
church
,
shut
off
from
the
real
life
*NL*
of
the
streets
,
inhumanly
respectable
as
a
top-hat
.
Mechanical
golf
and
*NL*
dinner-parties
and
bridge
and
conversation

Save
with
Paul
Riesling
,
*NL*
mechanical
friendships

back-slapping
and
jocular
,
never
daring
to
essay
*NL*
the
test
of
quietness

*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
uneasily
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
years
,
the
brilliant
winter
days
and
all
the
long
sweet
*NL*
afternoons
which
were
meant
for
summery
meadows
,
lost
in
such
brittle
*NL*
pretentiousness
.
He
thought
of
telephoning
about
leases
,
of
cajoling
men
*NL*
he
hated
,
of
making
business
calls
and
waiting
in
dirty
anterooms

hat
*NL*
on
knee

yawning
at

the
first
vice-president
,
and
even
the
president
of
*NL*
the
Traction
Company
protested
against
the
Babbitt
price
.
They
mentioned
*NL*
their
duty
toward
stockholders
,
they
threatened
an
appeal
to
the
courts
,
*NL*
though
somehow
the
appeal
to
the
courts
was
never
carried
out
and
the
*NL*
officials
found
it
wiser
to
compromise
with
Babbitt
.
Carbon
copies
of
*NL*
the
correspondence
are
in
the
company
's
files
,
where
they
may
be
viewed
*NL*
by
any
public
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
after
this
Babbitt
deposited
three
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
,
*NL*
the
purchasing-agent
of
the
Street
Traction
Company
bought
a
five
*NL*
thousand
dollar
car
,
he
first
vice-president
built
a
home
in
Devon
*NL*
Woods
,
and
the
president
was
appointed
minister
to
a
foreign
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
obtain
the
options
,
to
tie
up
one
man
's
land
without
letting
his
*NL*
neighbor
know
,
had
been
an
unusual
strain
on
Babbitt
.
It
was
necessary
*NL*
to
introduce
rumors
about
planning
garages
and
stores
,
to
pretend
*NL*
that
he
was
n't
taking
any
more
options
,
to
wait
and
look
as
bored
as
a
*NL*
poker-player
at
a
time
when
the
failure
to
secure
a
key-lot
threatened
*NL*
his
whole
plan
.
To
all
this
was
added
a
nerve-jabbing
quarrel
with
his
*NL*
secret
associates
in
the
deal
.
They
did
not
wish
Babbitt
and
Thompson
*NL*
to
have
any
share
in
the
deal
except
as
brokers
.
Babbitt
rather
*NL*
agreed
.
``
Ethics
of
the
business-broker
ought
to
strictly
represent
his
*NL*
principles
and
not
get
in
on
the
buying
,
''
he
said
to
Thompson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ethics
,
rats
!
Think
I
'm
going
to
see
that
bunch
of
holy
grafters
get
*NL*
away
with
the
swag
and
us
not
climb
in
?
''
snorted
old
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
like
to
do
it
.
Kind
of
double-crossing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
.
It
's
triple-crossing
.
It
's
the
public
that
gets
*NL*
double-crossed
.
Well
,
now
we
've
been
ethical
and
got
it
out
of
our
*NL*
systems
,
the
question
is
where
we
can
raise
a
loan
to
handle
some
of
*NL*
the
property
for
ourselves
,
on
the
Q.
T
.
We
ca
n't
go
to
our
bank
for
it
.
*NL*
Might
come
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
see
old
Eathorne
.
He
's
close
as
the
tomb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eathorne
was
glad
,
he
said
,
to
``
invest
in
character
,
''
to
make
Babbitt
*NL*
the
loan
and
see
to
it
that
the
loan
did
not
appear
on
the
books
of
the
*NL*
bank
.
Thus
certain
of
the
options
which
Babbitt
and
Thompson
obtained
*NL*
were
on
parcels
of
real
estate
which
they
themselves
owned
,
though
the
*NL*
property
did
not
appear
in
their
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
closing
this
splendid
deal
,
which
stimulated
business
*NL*
and
public
confidence
by
giving
an
example
of
increased
real-estate
*NL*
activity
,
Babbitt
was
overwhelmed
to
find
that
he
had
a
dishonest
person
*NL*
working
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dishonest
one
was
Stanley
Graff
,
the
outside
salesman
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
Babbitt
had
been
worried
about
Graff
.
He
did
not
keep
his
*NL*
word
to
tenants
.
In
order
to
rent
a
house
he
would
promise
repairs
*NL*
which
the
owner
had
not
authorized
.
It
was
suspected
that
he
juggled
*NL*
inventories
of
furnished
houses
so
that
when
the
tenant
left
he
had
*NL*
to
pay
for
articles
which
had
never
been
in
the
house
and
the
price
*NL*
of
which
Graff
put
into
his
pocket
.
Babbitt
had
not
been
able
to
prove
*NL*
these
suspicions
,
and
though
he
had
rather
planned
to
discharge
Graff
he
*NL*
had
never
quite
found
time
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
into
Babbitt
's
private
room
charged
a
red-faced
man
,
panting
,
``
Look
*NL*
here
!
I
've
come
to
raise
particular
merry
hell
,
and
unless
you
have
that
*NL*
fellow
pinched
,
I
will
!

``
What
's

Calm
down
,
o

man

What
's
trouble
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Trouble

Huh

Here
's
the
trouble

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
and
take
it
easy

They
can
hear
you
all
over

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
fellow
Graff
you
got
working
for
you
,
he
leases
me
a
house
.
I
*NL*
was
in
yesterday
and
signs
the
lease
,
all
O.K.
,
and
he
was
to
get
the
*NL*
owner
's
signature
and
mail
me
the
lease
last
night
.
Well
,
and
he
did
.
*NL*
This
morning
I
comes
down
to
breakfast
and
the
girl
says
a
fellow
had
*NL*
come
to
the
house
right
after
the
early
delivery
and
told
her
he
wanted
*NL*
an
envelope
that
had
been
mailed
by
mistake
,
big
long
envelope
with
*NL*
`
Babbitt-Thompson
'
in
the
corner
of
it
.
Sure
enough
,
there
it
was
,
so
*NL*
she
lets
him
have
it
.
And
she
describes
the
fellow
to
me
,
and
it
was
*NL*
this
Graff
.
So
I
`
phones
to
him
and
he
,
the
poor
fool
,
he
admits
it
!
He
*NL*
says
after
my
lease
was
all
signed
he
got
a
better
offer
from
another
*NL*
fellow
and
he
wanted
my
lease
back

Now
what
you
going
to
do
about
it

sounded
the
buzzer

When

he

To

Ca

Needless

And
of

your

stands

But
there
's
one
other
thing
I

*NL*
like
to
do

I
'll
tell
the
owner
not
to
pay

the
commission

apply
*NL*
it
to
your

No
!
Straight
!
I
want
to
.
To
be
frank
,
this
thing
shakes
*NL*
me
up
bad

I
suppose
I

always
been
a
Practical

Probably
*NL*
I

told
one

two
fairy

occasion
called

for
it

you

sometimes
you
have
to
lay
things

to
impress

boneheads

But
this
is
the
first
time
I
've
ever
had
to
accuse
one
of
*NL*
my
own
employees
of
anything
more
dishonest
than
pinching
a
few
stamps
.
*NL*
Honest
,
it
would
hurt
me
if
we
profited
by
it

So
you
'll
let
me
hand
you
*NL*
the

He
walked
through
the
February
city
,
where
trucks
flung
up
a
spattering
*NL*
of
slush
and
the
sky
was
dark
above
dark
brick
cornices
.
He
came
back
*NL*
miserable
.
He
,
who
respected
the
law
,
had
broken
it
by
concealing
the
*NL*
Federal
crime
of
interception
of
the
mails
.
But
he
could
not
see
Graff
*NL*
go
to
jail
and
his
wife
suffer
.
Worse
,
he
had
to
discharge
Graff
and
*NL*
this
was
a
part
of
office
routine
which
he
feared
.
He
liked
people
*NL*
so
much
,
he
so
much
wanted
them
to
like
him
that
he
could
not
bear
*NL*
insulting
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
McGoun
dashed
in
to
whisper
,
with
the
excitement
of
an
approaching
*NL*
scene
,
``
He
's
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

Ask
him

He
tried
to
make
himself
heavy
and
calm
in
his
chair
,
and
to
keep
his
*NL*
eyes
expressionless
.
Graff
stalked
in
--
a
man
of
thirty-five
,
dapper
,
*NL*
eye-glassed
,
with
a
foppish
mustache
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Want

said
Graff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Sit

*NL*
Graff
continued
to
stand

grunting

``
I
suppose
that
old

Varney

*NL*
been

Let
me
explain
about

He
's
a
regular
tightwad

*NL*

he
sticks
out
for
every

he
practically
lied
to
me

found

out

then
another

I
was

so
worried
about

skun
up

home
,
they
were
two
men
*NL*
together
.
Ted
was
young
only
in
his
assumption
of
oldness
,
and
the
only
*NL*
realms
,
apparently
,
in
which
Babbitt
had
a
larger
and
more
grown-up
*NL*
knowledge
than
Ted
's
were
the
details
of
real
estate
and
the
phrases
of
*NL*
politics
.
When
the
other
sages
of
the
Pullman
smoking-compartment
had
*NL*
left
them
to
themselves
,
Babbitt
's
voice
did
not
drop
into
the
playful
*NL*
and
otherwise
offensive
tone
in
which
one
addresses
children
but
*NL*
continued
its
overwhelming
and
monotonous
rumble
,
and
Ted
tried
to
*NL*
imitate
it
in
his
strident
tenor
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
,
dad
,
you
certainly
did
show
up
that
poor
boot
when
he
got
flip
*NL*
about
the
League
of
Nations
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
trouble
with
a
lot
of
these
fellows
is
,
they
simply
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
they
're
talking
about
.
They
do
n't
get
down
to
facts

What
*NL*
do
you
think
of
Ken
Escott
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
dad
:
it
strikes
me
Ken
is
a
nice
lad
;
no
special
faults
*NL*
except
he
smokes
too
much
;
but
slow
,
Lord
!
Why
,
if
we
do
n't
give
him
*NL*
a
shove
the
poor
dumb-bell
never
will

And
Rone
just
as
bad

*NL*
Slow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

you
're
right

They
're
slow

either

our
pep

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right

They
're
slow

I

dad

I
do
n't
know
how
Rone
got
*NL*
into
our
family

I
'll
bet

the

*NL*

*NL*
``
Well

out

*NL*
*NL*
They
roared
together
,
and
together
lighted
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
we
going
to
do
with

Babbitt
consulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
,
I
do
n't
know

I

,
sometimes
I
feel
like
taking
Ken
aside

putting
him
over
the
jumps
and
saying
to
him

Rone

twenty-five

you
going

develop
a

get
a

If
there
's
anything
that
George

I
can
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

at
that

it
might
not
be
so
bad
if
you

I
talked

he
might
not
understand

He
's
one
of
these
high

He
ca
n't
come
*NL*
down
to

lay
his
cards
on

They
sighed
,
and
were
silent
and
thoughtful
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conductor
came
in
.
He
had
once
called
at
Babbitt
's
office
,
to
ask
*NL*
about
houses
.
``
H

are
you

Mr.
Babbitt

We

*NL*
``
Well
now

what
do
you
know
about
that

Here
I
been
thinking

were

a

yourself

not
a
day
over
forty

hardly

and
you
with
this
*NL*
great
big

*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty

Why

I
'll
never
see
forty-five
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
fact
!
Would
n't
hardly
`
a

thought
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
it
's
a
bad
give-away
for
the
old
man
when
he
has
to
travel
*NL*
with
a
young
whale
like
Ted
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
it
is
.
''
To
Ted
:
``
I
suppose
you
're
in
college
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Proudly
,
``
No
,
not
till
next
fall
.
I
'm
just
kind
of
giving
the
diff
`
rent
*NL*
colleges
the
once-over
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
conductor
went
on
his
affable
way
,
huge
watch-chain
jingling
*NL*
against
his
blue
chest
,
Babbitt
and
Ted
gravely
considered
colleges
.
*NL*
They
arrived
at
Chicago
late
at
night
;
they
lay
abed
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
rejoicing
,
``
Pretty
nice
not
to
have
to
get
up
and
get
down
to
breakfast
,
*NL*
heh
?
''
They
were
staying
at
the
modest
Eden
Hotel
,
because
Zenith
*NL*
business
men
always
stayed
at
the
Eden
,
but
they
had
dinner
in
the
*NL*
brocade
and
crystal
Versailles
Room
of
the
Regency
Hotel
.
Babbitt
*NL*
ordered
Blue
Point
oysters
with
cocktail
sauce
,
a
tremendous
steak
with
*NL*
a
tremendous
platter
of
French
fried
potatoes
,
two
pots
of
coffee
,
apple
*NL*
pie
with
ice
cream
for
both
of
them
and
,
for
Ted
,
an
extra
piece
of
*NL*
mince
pie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hot
stuff
!
Some
feed
,
young
fella
!
''
Ted
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
You
stick
around
with
me
,
old
man
,
and
I
'll
show
you
a
good
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
a
musical
comedy
and
nudged
each
other
at
the
matrimonial
*NL*
jokes
and
the
prohibition
jokes
;
they
paraded
the
lobby
,
arm
in
arm
,
*NL*
between
acts
,
and
in
the
glee
of
his
first
release
from
the
shame
which
*NL*
dissevers
fathers
and
sons
Ted
chuckled
,
``
Dad
,
did
you
ever
hear
the
one
*NL*
about
the
three
milliners
and
the
judge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Ted
had
returned
to
Zenith
,
Babbitt
was
lonely
.
As
he
was
trying
*NL*
to
make
alliance
between
Offutt
and
certain
Milwaukee
interests
which
*NL*
wanted
the
race-track
plot
,
most
of
his
time
was
taken
up
in
waiting
for
*NL*
telephone
calls
...
Sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
,
holding
the
portable
*NL*
telephone
,
asking
wearily
,
``
Mr.
Sagen
not
in
yet
?
Didn
'
he
leave
any
*NL*
message
for
me
?
All
right
,
I
'll
hold
the
wire
.
''
Staring
at
a
stain
on
*NL*
the
wall
,
reflecting
that
it
resembled
a
shoe
,
and
being
bored
by
this
*NL*
twentieth
discovery
that
it
resembled
a
shoe
.
Lighting
a
cigarette
;
*NL*
then
,
bound
to
the
telephone
with
no
ashtray
in
reach
,
wondering
what
*NL*
to
do
with
this
burning
menace
and
anxiously
trying
to
toss
it
into
the
*NL*
tiled
bathroom
.
At
last
,
on
the
telephone
,
``
No
message
,
eh
?
All
right
,
*NL*
I
'll
call
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
he
wandered
through
snow-rutted
streets
of
which
he
*NL*
had
never
heard
,
streets
of
small
tenements
and
two-family
houses
and
*NL*
marooned
cottages
.
It
came
to
him
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
that
there
*NL*
was
nothing
he
wanted
to
do
.
He
was
bleakly
lonely
in
the
evening
,
when
*NL*
he
dined
by
himself
at
the
Regency
Hotel
.
He
sat
in
the
lobby
afterward
,
*NL*
in
a
plush
chair
bedecked
with
the
Saxe-Coburg
arms
,
lighting
a
cigar
*NL*
and
looking
for
some
one
who
would
come
and
play
with
him
and
save
him
*NL*
from
thinking
.
In
the
chair
next
to
him
-LRB-
showing
the
arms
of
Lithuania
-RRB-
*NL*
was
a
half-familiar
man
,
a
large
red-faced
man
with
pop
eyes
and
a
*NL*
deficient
yellow
mustache
.
He
seemed
kind
and
insignificant
,
and
as
*NL*
lonely
as
Babbitt
himself
.
He
wore
a
tweed
suit
and
a
reluctant
orange
*NL*
tie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
to
Babbitt
with
a
pyrotechnic
crash
.
The
melancholy
stranger
was
*NL*
Sir
Gerald
Doak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instinctively
Babbitt
rose
,
bumbling
,
``
How
're
you
,
Sir
Gerald
?
`
Member
*NL*
we
met
in
Zenith
,
at
Charley
McKelvey

Babbitt

my
name

real
*NL*
estate

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
How
d'
you
do
.
''
Sir
Gerald
shook
hands
flabbily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Embarrassed
,
standing
,
wondering
how
he
could
retreat
,
Babbitt
*NL*
maundered
,
``
Well
,
I
suppose
you
been
having
a
great
trip
since
we
saw
*NL*
you
in
Zenith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
.
British
Columbia
and
California
and
all
over
the
place
,
''
he
said
*NL*
doubtfully
,
looking
at
Babbitt
lifelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
find
business
conditions
in
British
Columbia
?
Or
I
suppose
*NL*
maybe
you
did
n't
look
into
'em
.
Scenery
and
sport
and
so
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scenery
?
Oh
,
capital

But
business
conditions
--
You
know
,
Mr.
Babbitt
,
*NL*
they
're
having
almost
as
much
unemployment
as
we
are
.
''
Sir
Gerald
was
*NL*
speaking
warmly
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
?
Business
conditions
not
so
doggone
good

eh

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

conditions
were
n't

all
what

hoped

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*
``
No

not

not

*NL*
``
That

a

're
waiting
for
somebody
to

take
you
out
to
some
big
shindig

Sir
Gerald

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shindig

Oh

Shindig

No

to
tell
you
the
truth

I
was
wondering
what
*NL*
the
deuce
I
could
do
this
evening
.
Do
n't
know
a
soul
in
Tchicahgo

I
*NL*
wonder
if
you
happen
to
know
whether
there
's
a
good
theater
in
this

city

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

*NL*
``

Went

Shocking

No

I
was
wondering

was
a
good
cinema-movie

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
sitting
down
,
hitching
his
chair
over
,
shouting
,
``
Movie

Say
,
Sir
Gerald

I
supposed

go

There

a
peach
of

at

Grantham
:
Bill

in
a

picture

*NL*
*NL*
``
Right-o

Just
a
moment

get

*NL*
*NL*
Swollen
with
greatness
,
slightly
afraid
lest
the
noble
blood
of
*NL*
Nottingham
change
its
mind
and
leave
him
at
any
street
corner
,
Babbitt
*NL*
paraded
with
Sir
Gerald
Doak
to
the
movie
palace
and
in
silent
bliss
sat
*NL*
beside
him
,
trying
not
to
be
too
enthusiastic
,
lest
the
knight
despise
*NL*
his
adoration
of
six-shooters
and
broncos
.
At
the
end
Sir
Gerald
*NL*
murmured
,
``
Jolly
good
picture

this

So
awfully
decent
of
you
to
take

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

Babbitt
's
speech
had
lost
the
delicate
refinement
*NL*
and
all
the
broad
A
's
with
which
he
had
adorned
it
,
and
become
hearty
*NL*
and
natural
.
``
Well

tickled

They
crawled
past
the
knees
of
fat
women
into
the
aisle
;
they
stood
in
*NL*
the
lobby
waving
their
arms
in
the
rite
of
putting
on
overcoats

Babbitt
*NL*
hinted
,
``
Say

how
about
a
little
something
to
eat

I
know
a
place

we
could
get

up

Sir

transformed

beefily
yearning

*NL*
Sir
Gerald
's
room
was
,
except
for
his
ponderous
and
durable
English
*NL*
bags
,
very
much
like
the
room
of
George
F.
Babbitt
;
and
quite
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
Babbitt
he
disclosed
a
huge
whisky
flask

looked
proud
and
*NL*
hospitable
,
and
chuckled
,
``
Say

It
was
after
the
third
drink
that
Sir

proclaimed
,
``

do
you

get
the
notion

The
real

we
think
those

hunting

all
that
sort

we

have

It
was
after
the
fourth
drink
that
Sir
Gerald
asked
humbly
,
``
What
do
you
*NL*
think
of
North
Dakota

it
was
not
till
after
the
fifth
*NL*
that
Babbitt
began
to
call
him
``
Jerry

Sir
Gerald
confided
,
``

ecstatically
stretched

knightly

his

out
on

lay
abed
at

imagining

asking

him

his

around

picturing

admonishing
her

It

just

says
to

in

yes

Jerry
's
an

*NL*
*NL*
But
that
evening
a
thing
happened
which
wrecked
his
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Regency
Hotel
cigar-counter
he
fell
to
talking
with
a
salesman
*NL*
of
pianos
,
and
they
dined
together
.
Babbitt
was
filled
with
friendliness
*NL*
and
well-being
.
He
enjoyed
the
gorgeousness
of
the
dining-room
:
the
*NL*
chandeliers
,
the
looped
brocade
curtains
,
the
portraits
of
French
kings
*NL*
against
panels
of
gilded
oak
.
He
enjoyed
the
crowd
:
pretty
women
,
good
*NL*
solid
fellows
who
were
``
liberal
spenders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gasped
.
He
stared
,
and
turned
away
,
and
stared
again
.
Three
tables
*NL*
off
,
with
a
doubtful
sort
of
woman
,
a
woman
at
once
coy
and
withered
,
*NL*
was
Paul
Riesling
,
and
Paul
was
supposed
to
be
in
Akron
,
selling
*NL*
tar-roofing
.
The
woman
was
tapping
his
hand
,
mooning
at
him
and
*NL*
giggling
.
Babbitt
felt
that
he
had
encountered
something
involved
*NL*
and
harmful
.
Paul
was
talking
with
the
rapt
eagerness
of
a
man
who
is
*NL*
telling
his
troubles
.
He
was
concentrated
on
the
woman
's
faded
eyes
.
*NL*
Once
he
held
her
hand
and
once
,
blind
to
the
other
guests
,
he
puckered
*NL*
his
lips
as
though
he
was
pretending
to
kiss
her
.
Babbitt
had
so
strong
*NL*
an
impulse
to
go
to
Paul
that
he
could
feel
his
body
uncoiling
,
his
*NL*
shoulders
moving
,
but
he
felt
,
desperately
,
that
he
must
be
diplomatic
,
*NL*
and
not
till
he
saw
Paul
paying
the
check
did
he
bluster
to
the
*NL*
piano-salesman
,
``
By
golly-friend
of
mine
over
there
--
`
scuse
me
*NL*
second
--
just
say
hello
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
Paul
's
shoulder
,
and
cried
,
``
Well
,
when
did
you
hit
town
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
glared
up
at
him
,
face
hardening
.
``
Oh
,
hello
,
George
.
Thought
you
'd
*NL*
gone
back
to
Zenith
.
''
He
did
not
introduce
his
companion
.
Babbitt
peeped
*NL*
at
her
.
She
was
a
flabbily
pretty
,
weakly
flirtatious
woman
of
forty-two
*NL*
or
three
,
in
an
atrocious
flowery
hat
.
Her
rouging
was
thorough
but
*NL*
unskilful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
staying
,
Paulibus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
turned
,
yawned
,
examined
her
nails
.
She
seemed
accustomed
to
*NL*
not
being
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
grumbled
,
``
Campbell
Inn
,
on
the
South
Side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
?
''
It
sounded
insinuating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
Unfortunately
!
''
Furiously
Paul
turned
toward
the
woman
,
smiling
*NL*
with
a
fondness
sickening
to
Babbitt
.
``
May
!
Want
to
introduce
you
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Arnold
,
this
is
my
old-acquaintance
,
George
Babbitt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleasmeech

''
growled
Babbitt
,
while
she
gurgled
,
``
Oh
,
I
'm
very
pleased
*NL*
to
meet
any
friend
of
Mr.
Riesling
's
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
demanded
,
``
Be
back
there
later
this
evening
,
Paul
?
I
'll
drop
*NL*
down
and
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
better
--
We
better
lunch
together
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
but
I
'll
see
you
to-night
,
too
,
Paul
.
I
'll
go
down
to
your
*NL*
hotel

I
'll
wait

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
sat
smoking
with
the
piano-salesman
,
clinging
to
the
warm
refuge
of
*NL*
gossip
,
afraid
to
venture
into
thoughts
of
Paul
.
He
was
the
more
affable
*NL*
on
the
surface
as
secretly
he
became
more
apprehensive
,
felt
more
*NL*
hollow
.
He
was
certain
that
Paul
was
in
Chicago
without
Zilla
's
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
that
he
was
doing
things
not
at
all
moral
and
secure
.
*NL*
When
the
salesman
yawned
that
he
had
to
write
up
his
orders
,
Babbitt
*NL*
left
him
,
left
the
hotel
,
in
leisurely
calm
.
But
savagely
he
said
*NL*
``
Campbell
Inn
!
''
to
the
taxi-driver
.
He
sat
agitated
on
the
slippery
*NL*
leather
seat
,
in
that
chill
dimness
which
smelled
of
dust
and
perfume
*NL*
and
Turkish
cigarettes
.
He
did
not
heed
the
snowy
lake-front
,
the
dark
*NL*
spaces
and
sudden
bright
corners
in
the
unknown
land
south
of
the
Loop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
office
of
the
Campbell
Inn
was
hard
,
bright
,
new
;
the
night
clerk
*NL*
harder
and
brighter
.
``
Yep
?
''
he
said
to
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Paul
Riesling
registered
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
in
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
if
you
'll
give
me
his
key
,
I
'll
wait
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
do
that
,
brother
.
Wait
down
here
if
you
wan
na
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
spoken
with
the
deference
which
all
the
Clan
of
Good
Fellows
*NL*
give
to
hotel
clerks
.
Now
he
said
with
snarling
abruptness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
have
to
wait
some
time
.
I
'm
Riesling
's
brother-in-law
.
I
'll
go
up
*NL*
to
his
room
.
D'
I
look
like
a
sneak-thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
was
low
and
not
pleasant
.
With
considerable
haste
the
*NL*
clerk
took
down
the
key
,
protesting
,
``
I
never
said
you
looked
like
a
*NL*
sneak-thief
.
Just
rules
of
the
hotel
.
But
if
you
want
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
way
up
in
the
elevator
Babbitt
wondered
why
he
was
here
.
Why
*NL*
should
n't
Paul
be
dining
with
a
respectable
married
woman
?
Why
had
he
*NL*
lied
to
the
clerk
about
being
Paul
's
brother-in-law
?
He
had
acted
like
a
*NL*
child
.
He
must
be
careful
not
to
say
foolish
dramatic
things
to
Paul
.
*NL*
As
he
settled
down
he
tried
to
look
pompous
and
placid
.
Then
the
*NL*
thought
--
Suicide
.
He
'd
been
dreading
that
,
without
knowing
it
.
Paul
*NL*
would
be
just
the
person
to
do
something
like
that
.
He
must
be
out
of
*NL*
his
head
or
he
would
n't
be
confiding
in
that
--
that
dried-up
hag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zilla
-LRB-
oh
,
damn
Zilla
!
how
gladly
he
'd
throttle
that
nagging
fiend
of
a
*NL*
woman
!
-RRB-
--
she
'd
probably
succeeded
at
last
,
and
driven
Paul
crazy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suicide
.
Out
there
in
the
lake
,
way
out
,
beyond
the
piled
ice
along
the
*NL*
shore
.
It
would
be
ghastly
cold
to
drop
into
the
water
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
--
throat
cut
--
in
the
bathroom
--
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
flung
into
Paul
's
bathroom
.
It
was
empty
.
He
smiled
,
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
at
his
choking
collar
,
looked
at
his
watch
,
opened
the
window
*NL*
to
stare
down
at
the
street
,
looked
at
his
watch
,
tried
to
read
the
*NL*
evening
paper
lying
on
the
glass-topped
bureau
,
looked
again
at
his
*NL*
watch
.
Three
minutes
had
gone
by
since
he
had
first
looked
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
waited
for
three
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
fixed
,
chilled
,
when
the
doorknob
turned
.
Paul
came
in
*NL*
glowering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
Paul
said
.
``
Been
waiting

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yuh

little
while

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Just
thought
I
'd
drop
in

see
how
you
made
out
in
Akron

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
all
right

What
difference
does
it
make
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Paul
,
what
are
you
sore
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

are

butting
into
my
affairs
for

*NL*
*NL*
``

glad

Slight
of

he
was
of

Paul
threw
his
snow-beaded

overcoat
on

floor

crouched
on

flimsy
cane

lumbered
up

The
Paul
who
normally
refused

cocktail
took
a
second
now

a

He
became
red-eyed
and
thick-tongued

He
was
embarrassingly

jocular

salacious

In

taxicab
Babbitt
incredulously

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
told

of

he
did
stop
at
Akron
,
between
*NL*
trains
,
for
the
one
purpose
of
sending
to
Zilla
a
postcard
with
``
Had

come
here

ran
into

In

he
called
on

If
for
public
appearances
Zilla
was
over-coiffed
,
over-painted
,
*NL*
and
resolutely
corseted
,
for
private
misery
she
wore
a
filthy
blue
*NL*
dressing-gown
and
torn
stockings
thrust
into
streaky
pink
satin
mules
.
*NL*
Her
face
was
sunken
.
She
seemed
to
have
but
half
as
much
hair
as
Babbitt
*NL*
remembered
,
and
that
half
was
stringy
.
She
sat
in
a
rocker
amid
a
debris
*NL*
of
candy-boxes
and
cheap
magazines
,
and
she
sounded
dolorous
when

was

breezy

returned
four

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
International
Organization
of
Boosters
'
Clubs
has
be
come
a
*NL*
world-force
for
optimism
,
manly
pleasantry
,
and
good
business
.
Chapters
*NL*
are
to
be
found
now
in
thirty
countries
.
Nine
hundred
and
twenty
of
the
*NL*
thousand
chapters
,
however
,
are
in
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
these
is
more
ardent
than
the
Zenith
Boosters
'
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
March
lunch
of
the
Zenith
Boosters
was
the
most
important
of
*NL*
the
year
,
as
it
was
to
be
followed
by
the
annual
election
of
officers
.
*NL*
There
was
agitation
abroad
.
The
lunch
was
held
in
the
ballroom
of
the
*NL*
O'Hearn
House
.
As
each
of
the
four
hundred
Boosters
entered
he
took
from
*NL*
a
wall-board
a
huge
celluloid
button
announcing
his
name
,
his
nick
name
,
*NL*
and
his
business
.
There
was
a
fine
of
ten
cents
for
calling
a
Fellow
*NL*
Booster
by
anything
but
his
nickname
at
a
lunch
,
and
as
Babbitt
jovially
*NL*
checked
his
hat
the
air
was
radiant
with
shouts
of
``
Hello
,
Chet
!
''
and
*NL*
``
How
're
you
,
Shorty
!
''
and
``
Top
o
'
the
mornin
'
,
Mac
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
at
friendly
tables
for
eight
,
choosing
places
by
lot
.
Babbitt
*NL*
was
with
Albert
Boos
the
merchant
tailor
,
Hector
Seybolt
of
the
Little
*NL*
Sweetheart
Condensed
Milk
Company
,
Emil
Wengert
the
jeweler
,
Professor
*NL*
Pumphrey
of
the
Riteway
Business
College
,
Dr.
Walter
Gorbutt
,
Roy
*NL*
Teegarten
the
photographer
,
and
Ben
Berkey
the
photo-engraver
.
One
of
*NL*
the
merits
of
the
Boosters
'
Club
was
that
only
two
persons
from
each
*NL*
department
of
business
were
permitted
to
join
,
so
that
you
at
*NL*
once
encountered
the
Ideals
of
other
occupations
,
and
realized
the
*NL*
metaphysical
oneness
of
all
occupations
--
plumbing
and
portrait-painting
,
*NL*
medicine
and
the
manufacture
of

Babbitt
's
table
was
particularly
happy
to-day
,
because
Professor
*NL*
Pumphrey
had
just
had
a
birthday
,
and
was
therefore
open
to
teasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
Babbitt
who
had
the
applause
,
with
``
Do
n't
talk
about
pumps
to
*NL*
that
guy
!
The
only
pump
he
knows
is
a

Honest

they
tell
me
he

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
each
place
was
the
Boosters
'
Club
booklet
,
listing
the
members
.
*NL*
Though
the
object
of
the
club
was
good-fellowship
,
yet
they
never
lost
*NL*
sight
of
the
importance
of
doing
a
little
more
business
.
After
each
name
*NL*
was
the
member
's
occupation
.
There
were
scores
of
advertisements
in
the
*NL*
booklet
,
and
on
one
page
the
admonition
:
``
There
's
no
rule
that
you
have
*NL*
to
trade
with
your
Fellow
Boosters
,
but
get
wise
,
boy
--
what
's
the
use
*NL*
of
letting
all
this
good
money
get
outside
of
our
happy
fambly

And
at
*NL*
each
place

to-day

there
was
a
present

a
card
printed
in

SERVICE
AND
BOOSTERISM
*NL*
*NL*
Service
finds
its
finest
opportunity
and
development
only
in
its
*NL*
broadest
and
deepest
application
and
the
consideration
of
its
perpetual
*NL*
action
upon
reaction
.
I
believe
the
highest
type
of
Service
,
like
the
*NL*
most
progressive
tenets
of
ethics
,
senses
unceasingly
and
is
motived
by
*NL*
active
adherence
and
loyalty
to
that
which
is
the
essential
principle
of

The

Retiring
President

Vergil
Gunch
was
in
the
chair
,
his
stiff
hair
like
a
hedge
,
his
*NL*
voice
like
a
brazen
gong
of
festival

Members
who
had
brought

*NL*
introduced
them
publicly

``

There
were
two
especially
distinguished
guests
:
the
leading
man
of
the
*NL*
``
Bird
of
Paradise
''
company
,
playing
this
week
at
the
Dodsworth
Theater
,
*NL*
and
the
mayor
of
Zenith
,
the
Hon.
Lucas
Prout
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
thundered
,
``
When
we
manage
to
grab
this
celebrated
Thespian
*NL*
off
his
lovely
aggregation
of
beautiful
actresses
--
and
I
got
to
admit
*NL*
I
butted
right
into
his
dressing-room
and
told
him
how
the
Boosters
*NL*
appreciated
the
high-class
artistic
performance
he
's
giving
us
--
and
*NL*
do
n't
forget
that
the
treasurer
of
the
Dodsworth
is
a
Booster
and
will
*NL*
appreciate
our
patronage
--
and
when
on
top
of
that
we
yank
Hizzonor
*NL*
out
of
his
multifarious
duties
at
City
Hall
,
then
I
feel
we
've
done
*NL*
ourselves
proud
,
and
Mr.
Prout
will
now
say
a
few
words
about
the
*NL*
problems
and
duties
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
rising
vote
the
Boosters
decided
which
was
the
handsomest
and
which
*NL*
the
ugliest
guest
,
and
to
each
of
them
was
given
a
bunch
of
carnations
,
*NL*
donated
,
President
Gunch
noted
,
by
Brother
Booster
H.
G.
Yeager
,
the
*NL*
Jennifer
Avenue
florist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
week
,
in
rotation
,
four
Boosters
were
privileged
to
obtain
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
generosity
and
of
publicity
by
donating
goods
or
services
*NL*
to
four
fellow-members
,
chosen
by
lot
.
There
was
laughter
,
this
week
,
*NL*
when
it
was
announced
that
one
of
the
contributors
was
Barnabas
Joy
,
the
*NL*
undertaker
.
Everybody
whispered
,
``
I
can
think
of
a
coupla
good
guys
to
*NL*
be
buried
if
his
donation
is
a
free
funeral
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
all
these
diversions
the
Boosters
were
lunching
on
chicken
*NL*
croquettes
,
peas
,
fried
potatoes
,
coffee
,
apple
pie
,
and
American
*NL*
cheese
.
Gunch
did
not
lump
the
speeches
.
Presently
he
called
on
the
*NL*
visiting
secretary
of
the
Zenith
Rotary
Club
,
a
rival
organization
.
*NL*
The
secretary
had
the
distinction
of
possessing
State
Motor
Car
License
*NL*
Number
5
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rotary
secretary
laughingly
admitted
that
wherever
he
drove
in
the
*NL*
state
so
low
a
number
created
a
sensation
,
and
``
though
it
was
pretty
*NL*
nice
to
have
the
honor
,
yet
traffic
cops
remembered
it
only
too
darn
*NL*
well
,
and
sometimes
he
did
n't
know
but
what
he
'd
almost
as
soon
have
*NL*
just
plain
B56
,876
or
something
like
that
.
Only
let
any
doggone
Booster
*NL*
try
to
get
Number
5
away
from
a
live
Rotarian
next
year
,
and
watch
the
*NL*
fur
fly
!
And
if
they
'd
permit
him
,
he
'd
wind
up
by
calling
for
a
cheer
*NL*
for
the
Boosters
and
Rotarians
and
the
Kiwanis
all
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
sighed
to
Professor
Pumphrey
,
``
Be
pretty
nice
to
have
as
low
a
*NL*
number
as
that
!
Everybody
'd
say
,
`
He
must
be
an
important
guy
!
'
Wonder
*NL*
how
he
got
it
?
I
'll
bet
he
wined
and
dined
the
superintendent
of
the
*NL*
Motor
License
Bureau
to
a
fare-you-well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Chum
Frink
addressed
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
you
may
feel
that
it
's
out
of
place
here
to
talk
on
a
strictly
*NL*
highbrow
and
artistic
subject
,
but
I
want
to
come
out
flatfooted
and
*NL*
ask
you
boys
to
O.K.
the
proposition
of
a
Symphony
Orchestra
for
Zenith
.
*NL*
Now
,
where
a
lot
of
you
make
your
mistake
is
in
assuming
that
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
like
classical
music
and
all
that
junk
,
you
ought
to
oppose
it
.
*NL*
Now
,
I
want
to
confess
that
,
though
I
'm
a
literary
guy
by
profession
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
a
rap
for
all
this
long-haired
music
.
I
'd
rather
listen
to
a
*NL*
good
jazz
band
any
time
than
to
some
piece
by
Beethoven
that
has
n't
any
*NL*
more
tune
to
it
than
a
bunch
of
fighting
cats
,
and
you
could
n't
whistle
*NL*
it
to
save
your
life
!
But
that
is
n't
the
point
.
Culture
has
become
as
*NL*
necessary
an
adornment
and
advertisement
for
a
city
to-day
as
pavements
*NL*
or
bank-clearances
.
It
's
Culture
,
in
theaters
and
art-galleries
and
so
*NL*
on
,
that
brings
thousands
of
visitors
to
New
York
every
year
and
,
to
be
*NL*
frank
,
for
all
our
splendid
attainments
we
have
n't
yet
got
the
Culture
*NL*
of
a
New
York
or
Chicago
or
Boston
--
or
at
least
we
do
n't
get
the
credit
*NL*
for
it
.
The
thing
to
do
then
,
as
a
live
bunch
of
go-getters
,
is
to
*NL*
CAPITALIZE
CULTURE
;
to
go
right
out
and
grab
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pictures
and
books
are
fine
for
those
that
have
the
time
to
study
'em
,
*NL*
but
they
do
n't
shoot
out
on
the
road
and
holler
`
This
is
what
little
*NL*
old
Zenith
can
put
up
in
the
way
of
Culture
.
'
That
's
precisely
what
*NL*
a
Symphony
Orchestra
does
do
.
Look
at
the
credit
Minneapolis
and
*NL*
Cincinnati
get
.
An
orchestra
with
first-class
musickers
and
a
swell
*NL*
conductor
--
and
I
believe
we
ought
to
do
the
thing
up
brown
and
get
*NL*
one
of
the
highest-paid
conductors
on
the
market
,
providing
he
ai
n't
a
*NL*
Hun
--
it
goes
right
into
Beantown
and
New
York
and
Washington
;
it
plays
*NL*
at
the
best
theaters
to
the
most
cultured
and
moneyed
people
;
it
gives
*NL*
such
class-advertising
as
a
town
can
get
in
no
other
way
;
and
the
guy
*NL*
who
is
so
short-sighted
as
to
crab
this
orchestra
proposition
is
passing
*NL*
up
the
chance
to
impress
the
glorious
name
of
Zenith
on
some
big
New
*NL*
York
millionaire
that
might-that
might
establish
a
branch
factory
here
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
also
go
into
the
fact
that
for
our
daughters
who
show
an
*NL*
interest
in
highbrow
music
and
may
want
to
teach
it
,
having
an
A1
local
*NL*
organization
is
of
great
benefit
,
but
let
's
keep
this
on
a
practical
*NL*
basis
,
and
I
call
on
you
good
brothers
to
whoop
it
up
for
Culture
and
a
*NL*
World-beating
Symphony
Orchestra
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
applauded
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
a
rustle
of
excitement
President
Gunch
proclaimed
,
``
Gentlemen
,
we
*NL*
will
now
proceed
to
the
annual
election
of
officers
.
''
For
each
of
the
*NL*
six
offices
,
three
candidates
had
been
chosen
by
a
committee
.
The
second
*NL*
name
among
the
candidates
for
vice-president
was
Babbitt
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
surprised
.
He
looked
self-conscious
.
His
heart
pounded
.
He
was
*NL*
still
more
agitated
when
the
ballots
were
counted
and
Gunch
said
,
``
It
's
*NL*
a
pleasure
to
announce
that
Georgie
Babbitt
will
be
the
next
assistant

gavel-wielder

I
know
of
no
man
who
stands
more
stanchly
for
common
*NL*
sense
and
enterprise
than
good
old
George

Come
on

let
's
give
him
our
*NL*
best
long
yell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
adjourned
,
a
hundred
men
crushed
in
to
slap
his
back
.
He
had
*NL*
never
known
a
higher
moment
.
He
drove
away
in
a
blur
of
wonder
.
He
*NL*
lunged
into
his
office
,
chuckling
to
Miss
McGoun
,
``
Well

I
guess
you
*NL*
better
congratulate

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
disappointed

She
answered
only
,
``

the

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
called

crowed
to
his

``

I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
drove
to
the
City
Prison
,
not
blindly
,
but
with
unusual
fussy
care
at
*NL*
corners
,
the
fussiness
of
an
old
woman
potting
plants
.
It
kept
him
from

facing
the
obscenity
of
fate

The
attendant
said
,
``

It
was
three

For
half
an
hour
Babbitt
sat
looking
at
a
calendar
and
*NL*
a
clock
on
a
whitewashed
wall
.
The
chair
was
hard
and
mean
and
creaky
.
*NL*
People
went
through
the
office
and
,
he
thought
,
stared
at
him
.
He
felt
*NL*
a
belligerent
defiance
which
broke
into
a
wincing
fear
of
this
machine
*NL*
which
was
grinding
Paul

Paul

Exactly
at
half-past
three
he
sent

The

returned
with

``

You
can
come
back

to-morrow

*NL*
Probably
the
poor
guy
is
off
his
nut

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
drove
,
not
at
all
carefully
or
fussily
,
sliding
viciously
past
*NL*
trucks
,
ignoring
the
truckmen
's
curses
,
to
the
City
Hall
;
he
stopped
*NL*
with
a
grind
of
wheels
against
the
curb
,
and
ran
up
the
marble
steps
to
*NL*
the
office
of
the
Hon.
Mr.
Lucas
Prout
,
the
mayor
.
He
bribed
the
mayor
's
*NL*
doorman
with
a
dollar
;
he
was
instantly
inside
,
demanding
,
``
You
remember
*NL*
me
,
Mr.
Prout
?
Babbitt
--
vice-president
of
the
Boosters
--
campaigned
for
*NL*
you
?
Say
,
have
you
heard
about
poor
Riesling
?
Well
,
I
want
an
order
on
*NL*
the
warden
or
whatever
you
call
um
of
the
City
Prison
to
take
me
back
*NL*
and
see
him
.
Good
.
Thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fifteen
minutes
he
was
pounding
down
the
prison
corridor
to
a
cage
*NL*
where
Paul
Riesling
sat
on
a
cot
,
twisted
like
an
old
beggar
,
legs
*NL*
crossed
,
arms
in
a
knot
,
biting
at
his
clenched
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
up
blankly
as
the
keeper
unlocked
the
cell
,
admitted
*NL*
Babbitt
,
and
left
them
together
.
He
spoke
slowly
:
``
Go
on
!
Be
moral
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
plumped
on
the
couch
beside
him
.
``
I
'm
not
going
to
be
moral
!
*NL*
I
do
n't
care
what
happened
!
I
just
want
to
do
anything
I
can
.
I
'm
glad
*NL*
Zilla
got
what
was
coming
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
said
argumentatively
,
``
Now
,
do
n't
go
jumping
on
Zilla
.
I
've
been
*NL*
thinking
;
maybe
she
has
n't
had
any
too
easy
a
time
.
Just
after
I
shot
*NL*
her
--
I
did
n't
hardly
mean
to
,
but
she
got
to
deviling
me
so
I
went
*NL*
crazy
,
just
for
a
second
,
and
pulled
out
that
old
revolver
you
and
I
*NL*
used
to
shoot
rabbits
with
,
and
took
a
crack
at
her
.
Did
n't
hardly
mean
*NL*
to
--
After
that
,
when
I
was
trying
to
stop
the
blood
--
It
was
terrible
*NL*
what
it
did
to
her
shoulder
,
and
she
had
beautiful
skin
--
Maybe
she
wo
n't
*NL*
die
.
I
hope
it
wo
n't
leave
her
skin
all
scarred
.
But
just
afterward
,
*NL*
when
I
was
hunting
through
the
bathroom
for
some
cotton
to
stop
the
*NL*
blood
,
I
ran
onto
a
little
fuzzy
yellow
duck
we
hung
on
the
tree
one
*NL*
Christmas
,
and
I
remembered
she
and
I
'd
been
awfully
happy
then
--
Hell
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
hardly
believe
it
's
me
here
.
''
As
Babbitt
's
arm
tightened
about
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
Paul
sighed
,
``
I
'm
glad
you
came
.
But
I
thought
maybe
you
'd
*NL*
lecture
me
,
and
when
you
've
committed
a
murder
,
and
been
brought
here
*NL*
and
everything
--
there
was
a
big
crowd
outside
the
apartment
house
,
all
*NL*
staring
,
and
the
cops
took
me
through
it
--
Oh
,
I
'm
not
going
to
talk
*NL*
about
it
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
went
on
,
in
a
monotonous
,
terrified
insane
mumble
.
To
divert
him
*NL*
Babbitt
said
,
``
Why
,
you
got
a
scar
on
your
cheek
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
That
's
where
the
cop
hit
me
.
I
suppose
cops
get
a
lot
of
fun
out
*NL*
of
lecturing
murderers
,
too
.
He
was
a
big
fellow
.
And
they
would
n't
let
*NL*
me
help
carry
Zilla
down
to
the
ambulance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
!
Quit
it
!
Listen
:
she
wo
n't
die
,
and
when
it
's
all
over
you
and
*NL*
I
'll
go
off
to
Maine
again
.
And
maybe
we
can
get
that
May
Arnold
to
*NL*
go
along
.
I
'll
go
up
to
Chicago
and
ask
her
.
Good
woman
,
by
golly
.
And
*NL*
afterwards
I
'll
see
that
you
get
started
in
business
out
West
somewhere
,
*NL*
maybe
Seattle
--
they
say
that
's
a
lovely
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
half
smiling
.
It
was
Babbitt
who
rambled
now
.
He
could
not
tell
*NL*
whether
Paul
was
heeding
,
but
he
droned
on
till
the
coming
of
Paul
's
*NL*
lawyer
,
P.
J.
Maxwell
,
a
thin
,
busy
,
unfriendly
man
who
nodded
at
*NL*
Babbitt
and
hinted
,
``
If
Riesling
and
I
could
be
alone
for
a
moment
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
wrung
Paul
's
hands
,
and
waited
in
the
office
till
Maxwell
came
*NL*
pattering
out
.
``
Look
,
old
man
,
what
can
I
do
?
''
he
begged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Not
a
thing
.
Not
just
now
,
''
said
Maxwell
.
``
Sorry
.
Got
to
*NL*
hurry
.
And
do
n't
try
to
see
him
.
I
've
had
the
doctor
give
him
a
shot
of
*NL*
morphine
,
so
he
'll
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
somehow
wicked
to
return
to
the
office
.
Babbitt
felt
as
though
*NL*
he
had
just
come
from
a
funeral
.
He
drifted
out
to
the
City
Hospital
to
*NL*
inquire
about
Zilla
.
She
was
not
likely
to
die
,
he
learned
.
The
bullet
*NL*
from
Paul
's
huge
old
.44
army
revolver
had
smashed
her
shoulder
and
torn
*NL*
upward
and
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
home
and
found
his
wife
radiant
with
the
horified
*NL*
interest
we
have
in
the
tragedies
of
our
friends
.
``
Of
course
Paul
is
n't
*NL*
altogether
to
blame
,
but
this
is
what
comes
of
his
chasing
after
other
*NL*
women
instead
of
bearing
his
cross
in
a
Christian
way
,
''
she
exulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
too
languid
to
respond
as
he
desired
.
He
said
what
was
to
be
said
*NL*
about
the
Christian
bearing
of
crosses
,
and
went
out
to
clean
the
car
.
*NL*
Dully
,
patiently
,
he
scraped
linty
grease
from
the
drip-pan
,
gouged
*NL*
at
the
mud
caked
on
the
wheels
.
He
used
up
many
minutes
in
washing
his
*NL*
hands
;
scoured
them
with
gritty
kitchen
soap
;
rejoiced
in
hurting
his
*NL*
plump
knuckles
.
``
Damn
soft
hands
--
like
a
woman
's
.
Aah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
,
when
his
wife
began
the
inevitable
,
he
bellowed
,
``
I
forbid
*NL*
any
of
you
to
say
a
word
about
Paul
!
I
'll
`
tend
to
all
the
talking
about
*NL*
this
that
's
necessary
,
hear
me
?
There
's
going
to
be
one
house
in
*NL*
this
scandal-mongering
town
to-night
that
is
n't
going
to
spring
the
*NL*
holier-than-thou
.
And
throw
those
filthy
evening
papers
out
of
the
*NL*
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
himself
read
the
papers
,
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
nine
he
set
out
for
the
house
of
Lawyer
Maxwell
.
He
was
received
*NL*
without
cordiality
.
``
Well
?
''
said
Maxwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
offer
my
services
in
the
trial

I
've
got
an
idea

Why
*NL*
could
n't
I
go
on
the
stand
and
swear
I
was
there
,
and
she
pulled
the
gun
*NL*
first

he
wrestled
with
her
and
the
gun
went
off
accidentally

*NL*

And
perjure
yourself

*NL*

Maxwell

just

known
many
and
many
a
case
of
*NL*
perjury

just
to
annex
some
rotten
little
piece

real
estate

*NL*
here
where
it
's
a
case
of
saving
Paul
from
going
to
prison

perjure

myself
black
in

*NL*
``
No

Aside
from
the
ethics
of
the
matter
,
I
'm
afraid
it
is
n't
*NL*
practicable

The
prosecutor
would
tear
your
testimony
to
pieces

It
's
*NL*
known
that
only
Riesling
and
his
wife
were
there
at
the
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

look
here

go
on

stand

swear

this
would
be
*NL*
the
God
's
truth

that
she
pestered
him
till
he
kind
of
went
crazy

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Sorry

Riesling
absolutely
refuses

have
any
testimony
reflecting

on
his

He
insists
on
pleading
guilty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let

get
up
and
testify
something

whatever
you

Let

do

SOMETHING

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry

Babbitt

but
the
best
thing
you
can
do

I
hate
to
say
it

but
you
could
help
us
most
by
keeping
strictly
out
of
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
,
revolving
his
hat
like
a
defaulting
poor
tenant
,
winced
so
*NL*
visibly
that
Maxwell
condescended
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
hurt
your
feelings
,
but
you
see
we
both
want
to
do
our
*NL*
best
for
Riesling
,
and
we
must
n't
consider
any
other
factor
.
The
trouble
*NL*
with
you
,
Babbitt
,
is
that
you
're
one
of
these
fellows
who
talk
too
*NL*
readily
.
You
like
to
hear
your
own
voice
.
If
there
were
anything
for
*NL*
which
I
could
put
you
in
the
witness-box
,
you
'd
get
going
and
give
the
*NL*
whole
show
away

Sorry

Now
I
must
look
over
some
papers

So
sorry

II
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
most
of
the
next
morning
nerving
himself
to
face
the
garrulous
*NL*
world
of
the
Athletic
Club
.
They
would
talk
about
Paul
;
they
would
*NL*
be
lip-licking
and
rotten
.
But
at
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
they
did
not
*NL*
mention
Paul
.
They
spoke
with
zeal
of
the
coming
baseball
season
.
He
*NL*
loved
them
as
he
never
had
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
doubtless
from
some
story-book
,
pictured
Paul
's
trial
as
a
*NL*
long
struggle
,
with
bitter
arguments
,
a
taut
crowd
,
and
sudden
and
*NL*
overwhelming
new
testimony
.
Actually
,
the
trial
occupied
less
than
*NL*
fifteen
minutes
,
largely
filled
with
the
evidence
of
doctors
that
Zilla
*NL*
would
recover
and
that
Paul
must
have
been
temporarily
insane
.
Next
day
*NL*
Paul
was
sentenced
to
three
years
in
the
State
Penitentiary
and
taken
*NL*
off
--
quite
undramatically
,
not
handcuffed
,
merely
plodding
in
a
tired
*NL*
way
beside
a
cheerful
deputy
sheriff
--
and
after
saying
good-by
to
him
*NL*
at
the
station
Babbitt
returned
to
his
office
to
realize
that
he
faced
a
*NL*
world
which
,
without
Paul
,
was
meaningless
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
was
busy
,
from
March
to
June
.
He
kept
himself
from
the
bewilderment
*NL*
of
thinking
.
His
wife
and
the
neighbors
were
generous
.
Every
evening
he
*NL*
played
bridge
or
attended
the
movies
,
and
the
days
were
blank
of
face
*NL*
and
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
June
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
and
Tinka
went
East
,
to
stay
with
relatives
,
and
*NL*
Babbitt
was
free
to
do
--
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
after
their
departure
he
thought
of
the
emancipated
house
*NL*
in
which
he
could
,
if
he
desired
,
go
mad
and
curse
the
gods
without
*NL*
having
to
keep
up
a
husbandly
front
.
He
considered
,
``
I
could
have
a
*NL*
reg
`
lar
party
to-night
;
stay
out
till
two
and
not
do
any
explaining
*NL*
afterwards
.
Cheers
!
''
He
telephoned
to
Vergil
Gunch
,
to
Eddie
Swanson
.
*NL*
Both
of
them
were
engaged
for
the
evening
,
and
suddenly
he
was
bored
by
*NL*
having
to
take
so
much
trouble
to
be
riotous
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
at
dinner
,
unusually
kindly
to
Ted
and
Verona
,
hesitating
*NL*
but
not
disapproving
when
Verona
stated
her
opinion
of
Kenneth
Escott
's
*NL*
opinion
of
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
's
opinion
of
the
opinions
of
the
*NL*
evolutionists
.
Ted
was
working
in
a
garage
through
the
summer
vacation
,
*NL*
and
he
related
his
daily
triumphs
:
how
he
had
found
a
cracked
ball-race
,
*NL*
what
he
had
said
to
the
Old
Grouch
,
what
he
had
said
to
the
foreman
*NL*
about
the
future
of
wireless
telephony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ted
and
Verona
went
to
a
dance
after
dinner
.
Even
the
maid
was
out
.
*NL*
Rarely
had
Babbitt
been
alone
in
the
house
for
an
entire
evening
.
He
was
*NL*
restless
.
He
vaguely
wanted
something
more
diverting
than
the
newspaper
*NL*
comic
strips
to
read
.
He
ambled
up
to
Verona
's
room
,
sat
on
her
maidenly
*NL*
blue
and
white
bed
,
humming
and
grunting
in
a
solid-citizen
manner
as
he
*NL*
examined
her
books
:
Conrad
's
``
Rescue
,
''
a
volume
strangely
named
``
Figures
*NL*
of
Earth
,
''
poetry
-LRB-
quite
irregular
poetry
,
Babbitt
thought
-RRB-
by
Vachel
*NL*
Lindsay
,
and
essays
by
H.
L.
Mencken
--
highly
improper
essays
,
making
fun
*NL*
of
the
church
and
all
the
decencies
.
He
liked
none
of
the
books
.
In
them
*NL*
he
felt
a
spirit
of
rebellion
against
niceness
and
solid-citizenship
.
*NL*
These
authors
--
and
he
supposed
they
were
famous
ones
,
too
--
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
care
about
telling
a
good
story
which
would
enable
a
fellow
to
forget
*NL*
his
troubles
.
He
sighed
.
He
noted
a
book
,
``
The
Three
Black
Pennies
,
''
*NL*
by
Joseph
Hergesheimer
.
Ah
,
that
was
something
like
it
!
It
would
be
an
*NL*
adventure
story
,
maybe
about
counterfeiting
--
detectives
sneaking
up
on
*NL*
the
old
house
at
night
.
He
tucked
the
book
under
his
arm
,
he
clumped
*NL*
down-stairs
and
solemnly
began
to
read
,
under
the
piano-lamp
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
twilight
like
blue
dust
sifted
into
the
shallow
fold
of
the
thickly
*NL*
wooded
hills
.
It
was
early
October
,
but
a
crisping
frost
had
already
*NL*
stamped
the
maple
trees
with
gold
,
the
Spanish
oaks
were
hung
with
*NL*
patches
of
wine
red
,
the
sumach
was
brilliant
in
the
darkening
*NL*
underbrush
.
A
pattern
of
wild
geese
,
flying
low
and
unconcerned
above
*NL*
the
hills
,
wavered
against
the
serene
ashen
evening
.
Howat
Penny
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
comparative
clearing
of
a
road
,
decided
that
the
*NL*
shifting
regular
flight
would
not
come
close
enough
for
a
shot
...
He
*NL*
had
no
intention
of
hunting
the
geese
.
With
the
drooping
of
day
*NL*
his
keenness
had
evaporated
;
an
habitual
indifference
strengthened
,
*NL*
permeating
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
it
was
again
:
discontent
with
the
good
common
ways
.
Babbitt
laid
*NL*
down
the
book
and
listened
to
the
stillness
.
The
inner
doors
of
the
*NL*
house
were
open
.
He
heard
from
the
kitchen
the
steady
drip
of
the
*NL*
refrigerator
,
a
rhythm
demanding
and
disquieting
.
He
roamed
to
the
*NL*
window
.
The
summer
evening
was
foggy
and
,
seen
through
the
wire
*NL*
screen
,
the
street
lamps
were
crosses
of
pale
fire
.
The
whole
world
was
*NL*
abnormal
.
While
he
brooded
,
Verona
and
Ted
came
in
and
went
up
to
*NL*
bed
.
Silence
thickened
in
the
sleeping
house
.
He
put
on
his
hat
,
his
*NL*
respectable
derby
,
lighted
a
cigar
,
and
walked
up
and
down
before
the
*NL*
house
,
a
portly
,
worthy
,
unimaginative
figure
,
humming
``
Silver
Threads
*NL*
among
the
Gold
.
''
He
casually
considered
,
``
Might
call
up
Paul
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
remembered
.
He
saw
Paul
in
a
jailbird
's
uniform
,
but
while
he
agonized
*NL*
he
did
n't
believe
the
tale
.
It
was
part
of
the
unreality
of
this
*NL*
fog-enchanted
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
were
here
Myra
would
be
hinting
,
``
Is
n't
it
late
,
Georgie
?
''
He
*NL*
tramped
in
forlorn
and
unwanted
freedom
.
Fog
hid
the
house
now
.
The
*NL*
world
was
uncreated
,
a
chaos
without
turmoil
or
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
mist
came
a
man
at
so
feverish
a
pace
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
dance
with
fury
as
he
entered
the
orb
of
glow
from
a
street-lamp
.
At
*NL*
each
step
he
brandished
his
stick
and
brought
it
down
with
a
crash
.
His
*NL*
glasses
on
their
broad
pretentious
ribbon
banged
against
his
stomach
.
*NL*
Babbitt
incredulously
saw
that
it
was
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
stopped
,
focused
his
vision
,
and
spoke
with
gravity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
another
fool
.
George
Babbitt
.
Lives
for

houses
.
Know
who
I
am
?
I
'm
traitor
to

.
I
'm
drunk
.
I
'm
*NL*
talking
too
much
.
I
do
n't
care
.
Know
what
I
could
've
been
?
I
could
've
*NL*
been
a

Maybe

Lissen

Just
*NL*
made
it
up

*NL*
Glittering
summery
meadowy
noise
*NL*
Of
beetles
and
bums
and
respectable
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hear
that
?
Whimzh

whimsy

*NL*
Cheer-up

All
tripe
!
Could
have
written
--
Too

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
darted
on
with
an
alarming
plunge
,
seeming
always
to
pitch
forward
*NL*
yet
never
quite
falling
.
Babbitt
would
have
been
no
more
astonished
*NL*
and
no
less
had
a
ghost
skipped
out
of
the
fog
carrying
his
head
.
*NL*
He
accepted
Frink
with
vast
apathy
;
he
grunted
,
``
Poor
boob
!
''
and
*NL*
straightway
forgot
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
plodded
into
the
house
,
deliberately
went
to
the
refrigerator
and
*NL*
rifled
it
.
When
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
at
home
,
this
was
one
of
the
major
*NL*
household
crimes
.
He
stood
before
the
covered
laundry
tubs
,
eating
a
*NL*
chicken
leg
and
half
a
saucer
of
raspberry
jelly
,
and
grumbling
over
a
*NL*
clammy
cold
boiled
potato
.
He
was
thinking
.
It
was
coming
to
him
that
*NL*
perhaps
all
life
as
he
knew
it
and
vigorously
practised
it
was
futile
;
*NL*
that
heaven
as
portrayed
by
the
Reverend
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
was
*NL*
neither
probable
nor
very
interesting
;
that
he
had
n't
much
pleasure
out
*NL*
of
making
money
;
that
it
was
of
doubtful
worth
to
rear
children
merely
*NL*
that
they
might
rear
children
who
would
rear
children
.
What
was
it
all
*NL*
about
?
What
did
he
want
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
blundered
into
the
living-room
,
lay
on
the
davenport
,
hands
behind
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
want
?
Wealth
?
Social
position
?
Travel
?
Servants
?
Yes
,
but
*NL*
only
incidentally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
it
up
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
know
that
he
wanted
the
presence
of
Paul
Riesling
;
and
from
*NL*
that
he
stumbled
into
the
admission
that
he
wanted
the
fairy
girl
--
in
*NL*
the
flesh
.
If
there
had
been
a
woman
whom
he
loved
,
he
would
have
fled
*NL*
to
her
,
humbled
his
forehead
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
his
stenographer
,
Miss
McGoun
.
He
thought
of
the
prettiest
*NL*
of
the
manicure
girls
at
the
Hotel
Thornleigh
barber
shop
.
As
he
fell
*NL*
asleep
on
the
davenport
he
felt
that
he
had
found
something
in
life
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
made
a
terrifying
,
thrilling
break
with
everything
that
was
*NL*
decent
and
normal
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
forgotten
,
next
morning
,
that
he
was
a
conscious
rebel
,
but
he
*NL*
was
irritable
in
the
office
and
at
the
eleven
o'clock
drive
of
telephone
*NL*
calls
and
visitors
he
did
something
he
had
often
desired
and
never
*NL*
dared
:
he
left
the
office
without
excuses
to
those
stave-drivers
his
*NL*
employees
,
and
went
to
the
movies
.
He
enjoyed
the
right
to
be
alone
.
He
*NL*
came
out
with
a
vicious
determination
to
do
what
he
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
approached
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
at
the
club
,
everybody
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
's
the
millionaire
!
''
said
Sidney
Finkelstein
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
him
in
his
Locomobile
!
''
said
Professor
Pumphrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
,
it
must
be
great
to
be
a
smart
guy
like
Georgie
!
''
moaned
Vergil
*NL*
Gunch
.
``
He
's
probably
stolen
all
of
Dorchester
.
I
'd
hate
to
leave
a
poor
*NL*
little
defenseless
piece
of
property
lying
around
where
he
could
get
his
*NL*
hooks
on
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
,
Babbitt
perceived
,
``
something
on
him
.
''
Also
,
they
``
had
their
*NL*
kidding
clothes
on
.
''
Ordinarily
he
would
have
been
delighted
at
the
*NL*
honor
implied
in
being
chaffed
,
but
he
was
suddenly
touchy
.
He
grunted
,
*NL*
``
Yuh
,
sure
;
maybe
I
'll
take
you
guys
on
as
office
boys
!
''
He
was
*NL*
impatient
as
the
jest
elaborately
rolled
on
to
its
denouement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
may
have
been
meeting
a
girl
,
''
they
said
,
and
``
No
,
I
think
*NL*
he
was
waiting
for
his
old
roommate
,
Sir
Jerusalem
Doak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
exploded
,
``
Oh
,
spring
it
,
spring
it
,
you
boneheads
!
What
's
the
great
*NL*
joke
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurray
!
George
is
peeved
!
''
snickered
Sidney
Finkelstein
,
while
a
grin
*NL*
went
round
the
table
.
Gunch
revealed
the
shocking
truth
:
He
had
seen
*NL*
Babbitt
coming
out
of
a
motion-picture
theater
--
at
noon
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
kept
it
up
.
With
a
hundred
variations
,
a
hundred
guffaws
,
they
said
*NL*
that
he
had
gone
to
the
movies
during
business-hours
.
He
did
n't
so
much
*NL*
mind
Gunch
,
but
he
was
annoyed
by
Sidney
Finkelstein
,
that
brisk
,
lean
,
*NL*
red-headed
explainer
of
jokes
.
He
was
bothered
,
too
,
by
the
lump
of
ice
*NL*
in
his
glass
of
water
.
It
was
too
large
;
it
spun
round
and
burned
his
*NL*
nose
when
he
tried
to
drink
.
He
raged
that
Finkelstein
was
like
that
*NL*
lump
of
ice
.
But
he
won
through
;
he
kept
up
his
banter
till
they
grew
*NL*
tired
of
the
superlative
jest
and
turned
to
the
great
problems
of
the
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
,
``
What
's
the
matter
with
me
to-day
?
Seems
like
I
've
got
an
*NL*
awful
grouch
.
Only
they
talk
so
darn
much
.
But
I
better
steer
careful
*NL*
and
keep
my
mouth
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
lighted
their
cigars
he
mumbled
,
``
Got
to
get
back
,
''
and
on
a
*NL*
chorus
of
``
If
you
WILL
go
spending
your
mornings
with
lady
ushers
at
the
*NL*
movies
!
''
he
escaped
.
He
heard
them
giggling
.
He
was
embarrassed
.
While
*NL*
he
was
most
bombastically
agreeing
with
the
coat-man
that
the
weather
*NL*
was
warm
,
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
longing
to
run
childishly
with
*NL*
his
troubles
to
the
comfort
of
the
fairy
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
Miss
McGoun
after
he
had
finished
dictating
.
He
searched
for
a
*NL*
topic
which
would
warm
her
office
impersonality
into
friendliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
going
on
your
vacation
?
''
he
purred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
go
up-state
to
a
farm
do
you
want
me
to
have
the
Siddons
*NL*
lease
copied
this
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
hurry
about
it
...
I
suppose
you
have
a
great
time
when
you
get
*NL*
away
from
us
cranks
in
the
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
and
gathered
her
pencils
.
``
Oh
,
nobody
's
cranky
here
I
think
I
*NL*
can
get
it
copied
after
I
do
the
letters

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gone
.
Babbitt
utterly
repudiated
the
view
that
he
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
discover
how
approachable
was
Miss
McGoun
.
``
Course
!
knew
there
*NL*
was
nothing
doing
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*

IV
*NL*
*NL*
Eddie
Swanson
,
the
motor-car
agent
who
lived
across
the
street
from
*NL*
Babbitt
,
was
giving
a
Sunday
supper
.
His
wife
Louetta
,
young
Louetta
who
*NL*
loved
jazz
in
music
and
in
clothes
and
laughter
,
was
at
her
wildest
.
She
*NL*
cried
,
``
We
'll
have
a
real
party
!
''
as
she
received
the
guests
.
Babbitt
*NL*
had
uneasily
felt
that
to
many
men
she
might
be
alluring
;
now
he
*NL*
admitted
that
to
himself
she
was
overwhelmingly
alluring
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
*NL*
had
never
quite
approved
of
Louetta
;
Babbitt
was
glad
that
she
was
not
*NL*
here
this
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
insisted
on
helping
Louetta
in
the
kitchen
:
taking
the
chicken
*NL*
croquettes
from
the
warming-oven
,
the
lettuce
sandwiches
from
the
*NL*
ice-box
.
He
held
her
hand
,
once
,
and
she
depressingly
did
n't
notice
it
.
*NL*
She
caroled
,
``
You
're
a
good
little
mother
's
-
helper
,
Georgie
.
Now
trot
in
*NL*
with
the
tray
and
leave
it
on
the
side-table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wished
that
Eddie
Swanson
would
give
them
cocktails
;
that
Louetta
*NL*
would
have
one
.
He
wanted
--
Oh
,
he
wanted
to
be
one
of
these
Bohemians
*NL*
you
read
about
.
Studio
parties
.
Wild
lovely
girls
who
were
independent
.
*NL*
Not
necessarily
bad
.
Certainly
not
!
But
not
tame
,
like
Floral
Heights
.
*NL*
How
he
'd
ever
stood
it
all
these
years
--
*NL*
*NL*
Eddie
did
not
give
them
cocktails
.
True
,
they
supped
with
mirth
,
and
*NL*
with
several
repetitions
by
Orville
Jones
of
``
Any
time
Louetta
wants
to
*NL*
come
sit
on
my
lap
I
'll
tell
this
sandwich
to
beat
it
!
''
but
they
*NL*
were
respectable
,
as
befitted
Sunday
evening
.
Babbitt
had
discreetly
*NL*
preempted
a
place
beside
Louetta
on
the
piano
bench
.
While
he
talked
*NL*
about
motors
,
while
he
listened
with
a
fixed
smile
to
her
account
of
the
*NL*
film
she
had
seen
last
Wednesday
,
while
he
hoped
that
she
would
hurry
up
*NL*
and
finish
her
description
of
the
plot
,
the
beauty
of
the
leading
man
,
*NL*
and
the
luxury
of
the
setting
,
he
studied
her
.
Slim
waist
girdled
*NL*
with
raw
silk
,
strong
brows
,
ardent
eyes
,
hair
parted
above
a
broad
*NL*
forehead
--
she
meant
youth
to
him
and
a
charm
which
saddened
.
He
thought
*NL*
of
how
valiant
a
companion
she
would
be
on
a
long
motor
tour
,
exploring
*NL*
mountains
,
picnicking
in
a
pine
grove
high
above
a
valley
.
Her
frailness
*NL*
touched
him
;
he
was
angry
at
Eddie
Swanson
for
the
incessant
family
*NL*
bickering
.
All
at
once
he
identified
Louetta
with
the
fairy
girl
.
He
*NL*
was
startled
by
the
conviction
that
they
had
always
had
a
romantic
*NL*
attraction
for
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
're
leading
a
simply
terrible
life
,
now
you
're
a
widower
,
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
!
I
'm
a
bad
little
fellow
and
proud
of
it
.
Some
evening
you
slip
*NL*
Eddie
some
dope
in
his
coffee
and
sneak
across
the
road
and
I
'll
show
*NL*
you
how
to
mix
a
cocktail
,
''
he
roared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
I
might
do
it
!
You
never
can
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whenever
you
're
ready
,
you
just
hang
a
towel
out
of
the
attic
*NL*
window
and
I
'll
jump
for
the
gin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
giggled
at
this
naughtiness
.
In
a
pleased
way
Eddie
Swanson
*NL*
stated
that
he
would
have
a
physician
analyze
his
coffee
daily
.
The
*NL*
others
were
diverted
to
a
discussion
of
the
more
agreeable
recent
*NL*
murders
,
but
Babbitt
drew
Louetta
back
to
personal
things
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
prettiest
dress
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
honestly
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
it
?
Why
,
say
,
I
'm
going
to
have
Kenneth
Escott
put
a
piece
in
the
*NL*
paper
saying
that
the
swellest
dressed
woman
in
the
U.
S.
is
Mrs.
E.
*NL*
Louetta
Swanson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
stop
teasing
me
!
''
But
she
beamed
.
``
Let
's
dance
a
little
.
*NL*
George
,
you
've
got
to
dance
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
he
protested
,
``
Oh
,
you
know
what
a
rotten
dancer
I
am
!
''
he
was
*NL*
lumbering
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
teach
you
.
I
can
teach
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
moist
,
her
voice
was
jagged
with
excitement
.
He
was
*NL*
convinced
that
he
had
won
her
.
He
clasped
her
,
conscious
of
her
smooth
*NL*
warmth
,
and
solemnly
he
circled
in
a
heavy
version
of
the
one-step
.
He
*NL*
bumped
into
only
one
or
two
people
.
``
Gosh
,
I
'm
not
doing
so
bad
;
hittin
'
*NL*
'em
up
like
a
regular
stage
dancer
!
''
he
gloated
;
and
she
answered
*NL*
busily
,
``
Yes
--
yes
--
I
told
you
I
could
teach
anybody
--
DO
N'T
TAKE
SUCH
*NL*
LONG
STEPS
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
was
robbed
of
confidence
;
with
fearful
concentration
*NL*
he
sought
to
keep
time
to
the
music
.
But
he
was
enveloped
again
by
her
*NL*
enchantment
.
``
She
's
got
to
like
me
;
I
'll
make
her
!
''
he
vowed
.
He
tried
*NL*
to
kiss
the
lock
beside
her
ear
.
She
mechanically
moved
her
head
to
*NL*
avoid
it
,
and
mechanically
she
murmured
,
``
Do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
hated
her
,
but
after
the
moment
he
was
as
urgent
as
*NL*
ever
.
He
danced
with
Mrs.
Orville
Jones
,
but
he
watched
Louetta
swooping
*NL*
down
the
length
of
the
room
with
her
husband
.
``
Careful
!
You
're
getting
*NL*
foolish
!
''
he
cautioned
himself
,
the
while
he
hopped
and
bent
his
solid
*NL*
knees
in
dalliance
with
Mrs.
Jones
,
and
to
that
worthy
lady
rumbled
,
*NL*
``
Gee
,
it
's
hot
!
''
Without
reason
,
he
thought
of
Paul
in
that
shadowy
*NL*
place
where
men
never
dance
.
``
I
'm
crazy
to-night
;
better
go
home
,
''
he
*NL*
worried
,
but
he
left
Mrs.
Jones
and
dashed
to
Louetta
's
lovely
side
,
*NL*
demanding
,
``
The
next
is
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
hot
;
I
'm
not
going
to
dance
this
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
boldly
,
``
come
out
and
sit
on
the
porch
and
get
all
nice
and
*NL*
cool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tender
darkness
,
with
the
clamor
in
the
house
behind
them
,
he
*NL*
resolutely
took
her
hand
.
She
squeezed
his
once
,
then
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louetta
!
I
think
you
're
the
nicest
thing
I
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
you
're
very
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
You
got
to
like
me
!
I
'm
so
lonely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
be
all
right
when
your
wife
comes
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
always
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
clasped
her
hands
under
her
chin
,
so
that
he
dared
not
touch
her
.
He
*NL*
sighed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
feel
punk
and
--
''
He
was
about
to
bring
in
the
tragedy
of
Paul
,
*NL*
but
that
was
too
sacred
even
for
the
diplomacy
of
love
.
''
--
when
I
get
*NL*
tired
out
at
the
office
and
everything
,
I
like
to
look
across
the
street
*NL*
and
think
of
you
.
Do
you
know
I
dreamed
of
you
,
one
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
a
nice
dream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
they
say
dreams
go
by
opposites
!
Now
I
must
run
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
on
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
go
in
yet
!
Please
,
Louetta
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
must
.
Have
to
look
out
for
my
guests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
'em
look
out
for
'em
selves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
do
that
.
''
She
carelessly
tapped
his
shoulder
and
slipped
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
two
minutes
of
shamed
and
childish
longing
to
sneak
home
he
*NL*
was
snorting
,
``
Certainly
I
was
n't
trying
to
get
chummy
with
her
!
Knew
*NL*
there
was
nothing
doing
,
all
the
time
!
''
and
he
ambled
in
to
dance
with
*NL*
Mrs.
Orville
Jones
,
and
to
avoid
Louetta
,
virtuously
and
conspicuously
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HIS
visit
to
Paul
was
as
unreal
as
his
night
of
fog
and
questioning
.
*NL*
Unseeing
he
went
through
prison
corridors
stinking
of
carbolic
acid
to
*NL*
a
room
lined
with
pale
yellow
settees
pierced
in
rosettes
,
like
the
*NL*
shoe-store
benches
he
had
known
as
a
boy
.
The
guard
led
in
Paul
.
Above
*NL*
his
uniform
of
linty
gray
,
Paul
's
face
was
pale
and
without
expression
.
*NL*
He
moved
timorously
in
response
to
the
guard
's
commands
;
he
meekly
*NL*
pushed
Babbitt
's
gifts
of
tobacco
and
magazines
across
the
table
to
the
*NL*
guard
for
examination
.
He
had
nothing
to
say
but
``
Oh
,
I
'm
getting
used
*NL*
to
it
''
and
``
I
'm
working
in
the
tailor
shop
;
the
stuff
hurts
my
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
knew
that
in
this
place
of
death
Paul
was
already
dead
.
And
as
*NL*
he
pondered
on
the
train
home
something
in
his
own
self
seemed
to
have
*NL*
died
:
a
loyal
and
vigorous
faith
in
the
goodness
of
the
world
,
a
fear
of
*NL*
public
disfavor
,
a
pride
in
success
.
He
was
glad
that
his
wife
was
away
.
*NL*
He
admitted
it
without
justifying
it
.
He
did
not
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Her
card
read
``
Mrs.
Daniel
Judique
.
''
Babbitt
knew
of
her
as
the
widow
of
*NL*
a
wholesale
paper-dealer
.
She
must
have
been
forty
or
forty-two
but
he
*NL*
thought
her
younger
when
he
saw
her
in
the
office
,
that
afternoon
.
She
*NL*
had
come
to
inquire
about
renting
an
apartment
,
and
he
took
her
away
*NL*
from
the
unskilled
girl
accountant
.
He
was
nervously
attracted
by
her
*NL*
smartness
.
She
was
a
slender
woman
,
in
a
black
Swiss
frock
dotted
with
*NL*
white
,
a
cool-looking
graceful
frock
.
A
broad
black
hat
shaded
her
face
.
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
lustrous
,
her
soft
chin
of
an
agreeable
plumpness
,
and
her
*NL*
cheeks
an
even
rose
.
Babbitt
wondered
afterward
if
she
was
made
up
,
but
*NL*
no
man
living
knew
less
of
such
arts
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
revolving
her
violet
parasol
.
Her
voice
was
appealing
without
*NL*
being
coy
.
``
I
wonder
if
you
can
help
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
delighted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
looked
everywhere
and
--
I
want
a
little
flat
,
just
a
bedroom
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
two
,
and
sitting-room
and
kitchenette
and
bath
,
but
I
want
one
*NL*
that
really
has
some
charm
to
it
,
not
these
dingy
places
or
these
new
*NL*
ones
with
terrible
gaudy
chandeliers
.
And
I
ca
n't
pay
so
dreadfully
*NL*
much
.
My
name
's
Tanis
Judique
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
maybe
I
've
got
just
the
thing
for
you
.
Would
you
like
to
chase
*NL*
around
and
look
at
it
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
have
a
couple
of
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
new
Cavendish
Apartments
,
Babbitt
had
a
flat
which
he
had
been
*NL*
holding
for
Sidney
Finkelstein
,
but
at
the
thought
of
driving
beside
*NL*
this
agreeable
woman
he
threw
over
his
friend
Finkelstein
,
and
with
a
*NL*
note
of
gallantry
he
proclaimed
,
``
I
'll
let
you
see
what
I
can
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dusted
the
seat
of
the
car
for
her
,
and
twice
he
risked
death
in
*NL*
showing
off
his
driving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
know
how
to
handle
a
car
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
her
voice
.
There
was
,
he
thought
,
music
in
it
and
a
hint
of
*NL*
culture
,
not
a
bouncing
giggle
like
Louetta
Swanson
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
boasted
,
``
You
know
,
there
's
a
lot
of
these
fellows
that
are
so
scared
*NL*
and
drive
so
slow
that
they
get
in
everybody
's
way
.
The
safest
driver
*NL*
is
a
fellow
that
knows
how
to
handle
his
machine
and
yet
is
n't
scared
to
*NL*
speed
up
when
it
's
necessary
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
you
drive
like
a
wiz

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no
--
I
mean
--
not
really

Of
course
,
we
had
a
car
--
I
mean
,
before
*NL*
my
husband
passed
on
--
and
I
used
to
make
believe
drive
it
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
any
woman
ever
learns
to
drive
like
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
there
's
some
mighty
good
woman
drivers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
,
these
women
that
try
to
imitate
men
,
and
play
golf
and
*NL*
everything

ruin
their
complexions
and
spoil
their
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so

I
never
did
like
these
mannish
females

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean

of
course

I
admire
them

dreadfully

I
feel
so
weak
and
*NL*
useless
beside
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
rats
now
!
I
bet
you
play
the
piano
like
a
wiz

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no
--
I
mean
--
not
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'll
bet
you
do

''
He
glanced
at
her
smooth
hands
,
her
diamond
and
*NL*
ruby
rings
.
She
caught
the
glance
,
snuggled
her
hands
together
with
*NL*
a
kittenish
curving
of
slim
white
fingers
which
delighted
him
,
and
*NL*
yearned
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
love
to
play

I
mean
--
I
like
to
drum
on
the
piano

but
I

n't
*NL*
had
any
real
training

Mr.
Judique
used
to
say
I
would
've
been
a
*NL*
good
pianist
if
I
'd
had
any
training

but
then
,
I
guess
he
was
just
*NL*
flattering
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bet
he
was

I
'll
bet
you
've
got
temperament

*NL*
``

you

Well

of

I
go
to
lots

highbrow

concerts

but
I
do
like
a
good
jazz
orchestra
,
right
up
on
its
toes
,
*NL*
with
the
fellow
that
plays
the
bass
fiddle
spinning
it
around

beating

up

bow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es

She
was
not
offended

but
she
was
non-committal

He
warned
*NL*
himself
,
``
Have
some
sense
now

chump

Do
n't
go
making
a
fool

with
loftiness
he
discoursed
:

*NL*
``

the
vice-president

Club

and
I
'm
running
one
of
the
committees
of
the
*NL*
State
Association
of
Real
Estate
Boards
,
and
that
means
a
lot
of
work
*NL*
and
responsibility
--
and
practically
no
gratitude
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
!
Public
men
never
do
get
proper
credit

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
each
other
with
a
high
degree
of
mutual
respect
,
and
at
*NL*
the
Cavendish
Apartments
he
helped
her
out
in
a
courtly
manner
,
waved
*NL*
his
hand
at
the
house
as
though
he
were
presenting
it
to
her
,
and
*NL*
ponderously
ordered
the
elevator
boy
to
``
hustle
and
get
the
keys
.
''
She
*NL*
stood
close
to
him
in
the
elevator
,
and
he
was
stirred
but
cautious
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pretty
flat
,
of
white
woodwork
and
soft
blue
walls
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Judique
gushed
with
pleasure
as
she
agreed
to
take
it
,
and
as
they
*NL*
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
elevator
she
touched
his
sleeve
,
caroling
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
so
glad
I
went
to
you
!
It
's
such
a
privilege
to
meet
a
man
who
*NL*
really
Understands
.
Oh
!
The
flats
SOME
people
have
showed
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
sharp
instinctive
belief
that
he
could
put
his
arm
around
her
,
*NL*
but
he
rebuked
himself
and
with
excessive
politeness
he
saw
her
to
the
*NL*
car
,
drove
her
home
.
All
the
way
back
to
his
office
he
raged
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
I
had
some
sense
for
once
...
Curse
it
,
I
wish
I
'd
tried
.
She
's
a
*NL*
darling
!
A
corker
!
A

charmer

Lovely
eyes
and
darling
lips

that
trim
waist

never
get
sloppy

like
some
women

No
,
no

no

a

cultured

One

the
brightest

met
these

many

*NL*
He
was
harassed
and
puzzled
by
it
,
but
he
found
that
he
was
turning
*NL*
toward
youth
,
as
youth
.
The
girl
who
especially
disturbed
him
--
though
he
*NL*
had
never
spoken
to
her
--
was
the
last
manicure
girl
on
the
right
in
the
*NL*
Pompeian
Barber
Shop
.
She
was
small
,
swift
,
black-haired
,
smiling
.
She
*NL*
was
nineteen
,
perhaps
,
or
twenty
.
She
wore
thin
salmon-colored
blouses
*NL*
which
exhibited
her
shoulders
and
her
black-ribboned
camisoles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
Pompeian
for
his
fortnightly
hair-trim
.
As
always
,
he
*NL*
felt
disloyal
at
deserting
his
neighbor
,
the
Reeves
Building
Barber
*NL*
Shop
.
Then
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
overthrew
his
sense
of
guilt
.
*NL*
``
Doggone
it
,
I
do
n't
have
to
go
here
if
I
do
n't
want
to
!
I
do
n't
own
the
*NL*
Reeves
Building

These
barbers
got
nothing
on
me

I
'll
doggone
well

*NL*
my
hair
cut
where
I
doggone
well
want
to

Do
n't
want
to
hear
anything
*NL*
more
about
it
!
I
'm
through
standing
by
people
--
unless
I
want

It
*NL*

I

The
Pompeian
Barber
Shop
was
in
the
basement
of
the
Hotel
Thornleigh
,
*NL*
largest
and
most
dynamically
modern
hotel
in
Zenith
.
Curving
marble
*NL*
steps
with
a
rail
of
polished
brass
led
from
the
hotel-lobby
down
to
the
*NL*
barber
shop
.
The
interior
was
of
black
and
white
and
crimson
tiles
,
*NL*
with
a
sensational
ceiling
of
burnished
gold
,
and
a
fountain
in
which
*NL*
a
massive
nymph
forever
emptied
a
scarlet
cornucopia
.
Forty
barbers
*NL*
and
nine
manicure
girls
worked
desperately
,
and
at
the
door
six
colored
*NL*
porters
lurked
to
greet
the
customers
,
to
care
reverently
for
their
hats
*NL*
and
collars
,
to
lead
them
to
a
place
of
waiting
where
,
on
a
carpet
like
*NL*
a
tropic
isle
in
the
stretch
of
white
stone
floor
,
were
a
dozen
leather
*NL*
chairs
and
a
table
heaped
with
magazines
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
porter
was
an
obsequious
gray-haired
negro
who
did
him
an
*NL*
honor
highly
esteemed
in
the
land
of
Zenith
--
greeted
him
by
name
.
Yet
*NL*
Babbitt
was
unhappy
.
His
bright
particular
manicure
girl
was
engaged
.
*NL*
She
was
doing
the
nails
of
an
overdressed
man
and
giggling
with
him
.
*NL*
Babbitt
hated
him
.
He
thought
of
waiting
,
but
to
stop
the
powerful
*NL*
system
of
the
Pompeian
was
inconceivable
,
and
he
was
instantly
wafted
*NL*
into
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
him
was
luxury
,
rich
and
delicate
.
One
votary
was
having
a
*NL*
violet-ray
facial
treatment
,
the
next
an
oil
shampoo
.
Boys
wheeled
about
*NL*
miraculous
electrical
massage-machines
.
The
barbers
snatched
*NL*
steaming
towels
from
a
machine
like
a
howitzer
of
polished
nickel
and
*NL*
disdainfully
flung
them
away
after
a
second
's
use
.
On
the
vast
marble
*NL*
shelf
facing
the
chairs
were
hundreds
of
tonics
,
amber
and
ruby
and
*NL*
emerald
.
It
was
flattering
to
Babbitt
to
have
two
personal
slaves
at
*NL*
once
--
the
barber
and
the
bootblack
.
He
would
have
been
completely
happy
*NL*
if
he
could
also
have
had
the
manicure
girl
.
The
barber
snipped
at
his
*NL*
hair
and
asked
his
opinion
of
the
Havre
de
Grace
races
,
the
baseball
*NL*
season
,
and
Mayor
Prout
.
The
young
negro
bootblack
hummed
``
The
Camp
*NL*
Meeting
Blues
''
and
polished
in
rhythm
to
his
tune
,
drawing
the
shiny
*NL*
shoe-rag
so
taut
at
each
stroke
that
it
snapped
like
a
banjo
string
.
*NL*
The
barber
was
an
excellent
salesman
.
He
made
Babbitt
feel
rich
and
*NL*
important
by
his
manner
of
inquiring
,
``
What
is
your
favorite
tonic
,
sir
?
*NL*
Have
you
time
to-day
,
sir
,
for
a
facial
massage
?
Your
scalp
is
a
little
*NL*
tight
;
shall
I
give
you
a
scalp
massage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
best
thrill
was
in
the
shampoo
.
The
barber
made
his
hair
*NL*
creamy
with
thick
soap
,
then
-LRB-
as
Babbitt
bent
over
the
bowl
,
muffled
in
*NL*
towels
-RRB-
drenched
it
with
hot
water
which
prickled
along
his
scalp
,
and
*NL*
at
last
ran
the
water
ice-cold
.
At
the
shock
,
the
sudden
burning
cold
on
*NL*
his
skull
,
Babbitt
's
heart
thumped
,
his
chest
heaved
,
and
his
spine
was
*NL*
an
electric
wire
.
It
was
a
sensation
which
broke
the
monotony
of
life
.
*NL*
He
looked
grandly
about
the
shop
as
he
sat
up
.
The
barber
obsequiously
*NL*
rubbed
his
wet
hair
and
bound
it
in
a
towel
as
in
a
turban
,
so
that
*NL*
Babbitt
resembled
a
plump
pink
calif
on
an
ingenious
and
adjustable
*NL*
throne
.
The
barber
begged
-LRB-
in
the
manner
of
one
who
was
a
good
fellow
*NL*
yet
was
overwhelmed
by
the
splendors
of
the
calif
-RRB-
,
``
How
about
a
little
*NL*
Eldorado
Oil
Rub
,
sir
?
Very
beneficial
to
the
scalp
,
sir
.
Did
n't
I
give
*NL*
you
one
the
last
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
n't
,
but
Babbitt
agreed
,
``
Well
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
quaking
eagerness
he
saw
that
his
manicure
girl
was
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
I
guess
I
'll
have
a
manicure
after
all
,
''
he
droned
,
and
*NL*
excitedly
watched
her
coming
,
dark-haired
,
smiling
,
tender
,
little
.
The
*NL*
manicuring
would
have
to
be
finished
at
her
table
,
and
he
would
be
able
*NL*
to
talk
to
her
without
the
barber
listening
.
He
waited
contentedly
,
not
*NL*
trying
to
peep
at
her
,
while
she
filed
his
nails
and
the
barber
shaved
*NL*
him
and
smeared
on
his
burning
cheeks
all
the
interesting
mixtures
which
*NL*
the
pleasant
minds
of
barbers
have
devised
through
the
revolving
ages
.
*NL*
When
the
barber
was
done
and
he
sat
opposite
the
girl
at
her
table
,
he
*NL*
admired
the
marble
slab
of
it
,
admired
the
sunken
set
bowl
with
its
tiny
*NL*
silver
taps
,
and
admired
himself
for
being
able
to
frequent
so
costly
a
*NL*
place
.
When
she
withdrew
his
wet
hand
from
the
bowl
,
it
was
so
sensitive
*NL*
from
the
warm
soapy
water
that
he
was
abnormally
aware
of
the
clasp
of
*NL*
her
firm
little
paw
.
He
delighted
in
the
pinkness
and
glossiness
of
her
*NL*
nails
.
Her
hands
seemed
to
him
more
adorable
than
Mrs.
Judique
's
thin
*NL*
fingers
,
and
more
elegant
.
He
had
a
certain
ecstasy
in
the
pain
when
she
*NL*
gnawed
at
the
cuticle
of
his
nails
with
a
sharp
knife
.
He
struggled
not
*NL*
to
look
at
the
outline
of
her
young
bosom
and
her
shoulders
,
the
more
*NL*
apparent
under
a
film
of
pink
chiffon
.
He
was
conscious
of
her
as
an
*NL*
exquisite
thing
,
and
when
he
tried
to
impress
his
personality
on
her
he
*NL*
spoke
as
awkwardly
as
a
country
boy
at
his
first
party
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
kinda
hot
to
be
working
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
is
hot
.
You
cut
your
own
nails
,
last
time
,
did
n't
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es
,
guess
I
must
've
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
ought
to
go
to
a
manicure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
maybe
that
's
so
.
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
looks
so
nice
as
nails
that
are
looked
after
good

I
*NL*
always
think
that
's
the
best
way
to
spot
a
real
gent
.
There
was
an
auto
*NL*
salesman
in
here
yesterday
that
claimed
you
could
always
tell
a
fellow
's
*NL*
class
by
the
car
he
drove
,
but
I
says
to
him
,
`
Do
n't
be
silly
,
'
I
says
;
*NL*
`
the
wisenheimers
grab
a
look
at
a
fellow
's
nails
when
they
want
to
tell
*NL*
if
he
's
a
tin-horn
or
a
real
gent
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
maybe
there
's
something
to
that
.
Course
,
that
is
--
with
a
pretty
*NL*
kiddy
like
you
,
a
man
ca
n't

coming
to
get
his
mitts
done

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh

may
be
a
kid

I
'm
a
wise
bird

and
I
know
nice
folks
when
*NL*
I
see
um

I
can
read
character
at
a
glance

and
I
'd
never
talk
so
frank
*NL*
with
a
fellow
if
I
could
n't
see
he
was
a
nice
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
.
Her
eyes
seemed
to
him
as
gentle
as
April
pools
.
With
great
*NL*
seriousness
he
informed
himself
that
``
there
were
some
roughnecks
who
*NL*
would
think
that
just
because
a
girl
was
a
manicure
girl
and
maybe
not
*NL*
awful
well
educated
,
she
was
no
good
,
but
as
for
him
,
he
was
a
democrat
,
*NL*
and
understood
people
,
''
and
he
stood
by
the
assertion
that
this
was
a
*NL*
fine
girl
,
a
good
girl
--
but
not
too
uncomfortably
good
.
He
inquired
in
a
*NL*
voice
quick
with
sympathy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
a
lot
of
fellows
who

fresh

the
briskness

one

have
been
hurt

There
's
one
nice

about

chance

some
awfully
nice
gentlemen
and
improve
her
mind
with

conversation

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here

Ida
;
please

''
He
was
hotly
*NL*
reflecting
that
it
would
be
humiliating
to
be
rejected
by
this
child
,
*NL*
and
dangerous
to
be
accepted
.
If
he
took
her
to
dinner
,
if
he
were
seen
*NL*
by
censorious
friends
--
But
he
went
on
ardently
:
``
Do
n't
think
I
'm
getting
*NL*
fresh
if
I
suggest
it
would
be
nice
for
us
to
go
out
and
have
a
little
*NL*
dinner
together
some
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
as
I
ought
to
but
--
My
gentleman-friend
's
always
wanting
to
*NL*
take
me
out
.
But
maybe
I
could
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reason
,
he
assured
himself
,
why
he
should
n't
have
a
*NL*
quiet
dinner
with
a
poor
girl
who
would
benefit
by
association
with
an
*NL*
educated
and
mature
person
like
himself
.
But
,
lest
some
one
see
them
and
*NL*
not
understand
,
he
would
take
her
to
Biddlemeier
's
Inn
,
on
the
outskirts
*NL*
of
the
city
.
They
would
have
a
pleasant
drive
,
this
hot
lonely
evening
,
*NL*
and
he
might
hold
her
hand
--
no
,
he
would
n't
even
do
that
.
Ida
was
*NL*
complaisant
;
her
bare
shoulders
showed
it
only
too
clearly
;
but
he
'd
be
*NL*
hanged
if
he
'd
make
love
to
her
merely
because
she
expected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
car
broke
down
;
something
had
happened
to
the
ignition
.
And
he
*NL*
HAD
to
have
the
car
this
evening
!
Furiously
he
tested
the
spark-plugs
,
*NL*
stared
at
the
commutator
.
His
angriest
glower
did
not
seem
to
stir
the
*NL*
sulky
car
,
and
in
disgrace
it
was
hauled
off
to
a
garage
.
With
a
renewed
*NL*
thrill
he
thought
of
a
taxicab
.
There
was
something
at
once
wealthy
and
*NL*
interestingly
wicked
about
a
taxicab
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
he
met
her
,
on
a
corner
two
blocks
from
the
Hotel
Thornleigh
,
*NL*
she
said
,
``
A
taxi
?
Why
,
I
thought
you
owned
a
car
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
Of
course
I
do
!
But
it
's
out
of
commission
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
remarked
,
as
one
who
had
heard
that
tale
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
out
to
Biddlemeier
's
Inn
he
tried
to
talk
as
an
old
friend
,
*NL*
but
he
could
not
pierce
the
wall
of
her
words
.
With
interminable
*NL*
indignation
she
narrated
her
retorts
to
``
that
fresh
head-barber
''
and
the
*NL*
drastic
things
she
would
do
to
him
if
he
persisted
in
saying
that
she
*NL*
was
``
better
at
gassing
than
at
hoof-paring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Biddlemeier
's
Inn
they
were
unable
to
get
anything
to
drink
.
The
*NL*
head-waiter
refused
to
understand
who
George
F.
Babbitt
was
.
They
*NL*
sat
steaming
before
a
vast
mixed
grill
,
and
made
conversation
about
*NL*
baseball
.
When
he
tried
to
hold
Ida
's
hand
she
said
with
bright
*NL*
friendliness
,
``
Careful
!
That
fresh
waiter
is
rubbering
.
''
But
they
came
*NL*
out
into
a
treacherous
summer
night
,
the
air
lazy
and
a
little
moon
*NL*
above
transfigured
maples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
drive
some
other
place
,
where
we
can
get
a
drink
and
dance
!
''
he
*NL*
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
some
other
night
.
But
I
promised
Ma
I
'd
be
home
early
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rats
!
It
's
too
nice
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
just
love
to
,
but
Ma
would
give
me
fits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
trembling
.
She
was
everything
that
was
young
and
exquisite
.
He
*NL*
put
his
arm
about
her
.
She
snuggled
against
his
shoulder
,
unafraid
,
*NL*
and
he
was
triumphant
.
Then
she
ran
down
the
steps
of
the
Inn
,
singing
,
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
Georgie
,
we
'll
have
a
nice
drive
and
get
cool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
night
of
lovers
.
All
along
the
highway
into
Zenith
,
under
the
*NL*
low
and
gentle
moon
,
motors
were
parked
and
dim
figures
were
clasped
in
*NL*
revery
.
He
held
out
hungry
hands
to
Ida
,
and
when
she
patted
them
he
was
*NL*
grateful
.
There
was
no
sense
of
struggle
and
transition
;
he
kissed
her
*NL*
and
simply
she
responded
to
his
kiss
,
they
two
behind
the
stolid
back
of
*NL*
the
chauffeur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hat
fell
off
,
and
she
broke
from
his
embrace
to
reach
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
it
be
!
''
he
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
?
My
hat
?
Not
a
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
till
she
had
pinned
it
on
,
then
his
arm
sank
about
her
.
She
*NL*
drew
away
from
it
,
and
said
with
maternal
soothing
,
``
Now
,
do
n't
be
a
*NL*
silly
boy
!
Must
n't
make
Ittle
Mama
scold
!
Just
sit
back
,
dearie
,
and
see
*NL*
what
a
swell
night
it
is
.
If
you
're
a
good
boy
,
maybe
I
'll
kiss
you
when
*NL*
we
say
nighty-night
.
Now
give
me
a
cigarette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
solicitous
about
lighting
her
cigarette
and
inquiring
as
to
*NL*
her
comfort
.
Then
he
sat
as
far
from
her
as
possible
.
He
was
cold
with
*NL*
failure
.
No
one
could
have
told
Babbitt
that
he
was
a
fool
with
more
*NL*
vigor
,
precision
,
and
intelligence
than
he
himself
displayed
.
He
*NL*
reflected
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
Rev.
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
*NL*
he
was
a
wicked
man
,
and
from
the
standpoint
of
Miss
Ida
Putiak
,
an
old
*NL*
bore
who
had
to
be
endured
as
the
penalty
attached
to
eating
a
large
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearie
,
you
are
n't
going
to
go
and
get
peevish
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
pertly
.
He
wanted
to
spank
her
.
He
brooded
,
``
I
do
n't
have
to
*NL*
take
anything
off
this
gutter-pup
!
Darn
immigrant
!
Well
,
let
's
get
it
*NL*
over
as
quick
as
we
can
,
and
sneak
home
and
kick
ourselves
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
snorted
,
``
Huh
?
Me
peevish
?
Why
,
you
baby
,
why
should
I
be
peevish
?
*NL*
Now
,
listen
,
Ida
;
listen
to
Uncle
George
.
I
want
to
put
you
wise
about
*NL*
this
scrapping
with
your
head-barber
all
the
time
.
I
've
had
a
lot
*NL*
of
experience
with
employees
,
and
let
me
tell
you
it
does
n't
pay
to
*NL*
antagonize
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
drab
wooden
house
in
which
she
lived
he
said
good-night
briefly
*NL*
and
amiably
,
but
as
the
taxicab
drove
off
he
was
praying
``
Oh
,
my
God
!

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
awoke
to
stretch
cheerfully
as
he
listened
to
the
sparrows
,
then
to
*NL*
remember
that
everything
was
wrong
;
that
he
was
determined
to
go
astray
,
*NL*
and
not
in
the
least
enjoying
the
process
.
Why
,
he
wondered
,
should
he
*NL*
be
in
rebellion
?
What
was
it
all
about
?
``
Why
not
be
sensible
;
stop
all
*NL*
this
idiotic
running
around
,
and
enjoy
himself
with
his
family
,
*NL*
his
business
,
the
fellows
at
the
club
?
''
What
was
he
getting
out
of
*NL*
rebellion
?
Misery
and
shame
--
the
shame
of
being
treated
as
an
offensive
*NL*
small
boy
by
a
ragamuffin
like
Ida
Putiak
!
And
yet
--
Always
he
came
back
*NL*
to
``
And
yet
.
''
Whatever
the
misery
,
he
could
not
regain
contentment
with
*NL*
a
world
which
,
once
doubted
,
became
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
he
assured
himself
,
he
was
``
through
with
this
chasing
after
*NL*
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
noontime
he
was
not
so
sure
even
of
that
.
If
in
Miss
McGoun
,
Louetta
*NL*
Swanson
,
and
Ida
he
had
failed
to
find
the
lady
kind
and
lovely
,
it
did
*NL*
not
prove
that
she
did
not
exist
.
He
was
hunted
by
the
ancient
thought
*NL*
that
somewhere
must
exist
the
not
impossible
she
who
would
understand
*NL*
him
,
value
him
,
and
make
him
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
returned
in
August
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
previous
absences
he
had
missed
her
reassuring
buzz
and
of
her
*NL*
arrival
he
had
made
a
fete
.
Now
,
though
he
dared
not
hurt
her
by
letting
*NL*
a
hint
of
it
appear
in
his
letters
,
he
was
sorry
that
she
was
coming
*NL*
before
he
had
found
himself
,
and
he
was
embarrassed
by
the
need
of
*NL*
meeting
her
and
looking
joyful
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loitered
down
to
the
station
;
he
studied
the
summer-resort
posters
,
*NL*
lest
he
have
to
speak
to
acquaintances
and
expose
his
uneasiness
.
But
*NL*
he
was
well
trained
.
When
the
train
clanked
in
he
was
out
on
the
cement
*NL*
platform
,
peering
into
the
chair-cars
,
and
as
he
saw
her
in
the
line
of
*NL*
passengers
moving
toward
the
vestibule
he
waved
his
hat
.
At
the
door
he
*NL*
embraced
her
,
and
announced
,
``
Well
,
well
,
well
,
well
,
by
golly
,
you
look
*NL*
fine
,
you
look
fine
.
''
Then
he
was
aware
of
Tinka
.
Here
was
something
,
*NL*
this
child
with
her
absurd
little
nose
and
lively
eyes
,
that
loved
him
,
*NL*
believed
him
great
,
and
as
he
clasped
her
,
lifted
and
held
her
till
she
*NL*
squealed
,
he
was
for
the
moment
come
back
to
his
old
steady
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tinka
sat
beside
him
in
the
car
,
with
one
hand
on
the
steering-wheel
,
*NL*
pretending
to
help
him
drive
,
and
he
shouted
back
to
his
wife
,
``
I
'll
bet
*NL*
the
kid
will
be
the
best
chuffer
in
the
family
!
She
holds
the
wheel
like
*NL*
an
old
professional
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
he
was
dreading
the
moment
when
he
would
be
alone
with
his
*NL*
wife
and
she
would
patiently
expect
him
to
be
ardent
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
about
the
house
an
unofficial
theory
that
he
was
to
take
*NL*
his
vacation
alone
,
to
spend
a
week
or
ten
days
in
Catawba
,
but
he
was
*NL*
nagged
by
the
memory
that
a
year
ago
he
had
been
with
Paul
in
Maine
.
He
*NL*
saw
himself
returning
;
finding
peace
there
,
and
the
presence
of
Paul
,
*NL*
in
a
life
primitive
and
heroic
.
Like
a
shock
came
the
thought
that
he
*NL*
actually
could
go
.
Only
,
he
could
n't
,
really
;
he
could
n't
leave
his
*NL*
business
,
and
``
Myra
would
think
it
sort
of
funny
,
his
going
way
off
*NL*
there
alone
.
Course
he
'd
decided
to
do
whatever
he
darned
pleased
,
from
*NL*
now
on
,
but
still
--
to
go
way
off
to
Maine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
,
after
lengthy
meditations
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
his
wife
,
since
it
was
inconceivable
to
explain
that
he
was
going
*NL*
to
seek
Paul
's
spirit
in
the
wilderness
,
he
frugally
employed
the
lie
*NL*
prepared
over
a
year
ago
and
scarcely
used
at
all
.
He
said
that
he
had
*NL*
to
see
a
man
in
New
York
on
business
.
He
could
not
have
explained
even
*NL*
to
himself
why
he
drew
from
the
bank
several
hundred
dollars
more
than
*NL*
he
needed
,
nor
why
he
kissed
Tinka
so
tenderly
,
and
cried
,
``
God
bless
*NL*
you
,
baby
!
''
From
the
train
he
waved
to
her
till
she
was
but
a
scarlet
*NL*
spot
beside
the
brown
bulkier
presence
of
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
steel
and
cement
aisle
ending
in
vast
barred
gates
.
With
melancholy
he
*NL*
looked
back
at
the
last
suburb
of
Zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
north
he
pictured
the
Maine
guides
:
simple
and
strong
and
*NL*
daring
,
jolly
as
they
played
stud-poker
in
their
unceiled
shack
,
wise
*NL*
in
woodcraft
as
they
tramped
the
forest
and
shot
the
rapids
.
He
*NL*
particularly
remembered
Joe
Paradise
,
half
Yankee
,
half
Indian
.
If
he
*NL*
could
but
take
up
a
backwoods
claim
with
a
man
like
Joe
,
work
hard
with
*NL*
his
hands
,
be
free
and
noisy
in
a
flannel
shirt
,
and
never
come
back
to
*NL*
this
dull
decency
!
*NL*
*NL*
Or
,
like
a
trapper
in
a
Northern
Canada
movie
,
plunge
through
the
*NL*
forest
,
make
camp
in
the
Rockies
,
a
grim
and
wordless
caveman
!
Why
not
?
*NL*
He
COULD
do
it
!
There
'd
be
enough
money
at
home
for
the
family
to
live
*NL*
on
till
Verona
was
married
and
Ted
self-supporting
.
Old
Henry
T.
would
*NL*
look
out
for
them
.
Honestly
!
Why
NOT
?
Really
LIVE
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
longed
for
it
,
admitted
that
he
longed
for
it
,
then
almost
believed
*NL*
that
he
was
going
lo
do
it
.
Whenever
common
sense
snorted
,
``
Nonsense
!
*NL*
Folks
do
n't
run
away
from
decent
families
and
partners
;
just
simply
*NL*
do
n't
do
it
,
that
's
all
!
''
then
Babbitt
answered
pleadingly
,
``
Well
,
it
*NL*
would
n't
take
any
more
nerve
than
for
Paul
to
go
to
jail
and
--
Lord
,
*NL*
how
I
'd
'
like
to
do
it
!
Moccasins-six-gun-frontier
town-gamblers
--
sleep
*NL*
under
the
stars
--
be
a
regular
man
,
with
he-men
like
Joe
Paradise
--
gosh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
came
to
Maine
,
again
stood
on
the
wharf
before
the
camp-hotel
,
*NL*
again
spat
heroically
into
the
delicate
and
shivering
water
,
while
the
*NL*
pines
rustled
,
the
mountains
glowed
,
and
a
trout
leaped
and
fell
in
a
*NL*
sliding
circle
.
He
hurried
to
the
guides
'
shack
as
to
his
real
home
,
*NL*
his
real
friends
,
long
missed
.
They
would
be
glad
to
see
him
.
They
would
*NL*
stand
up
and
shout
?
``
Why
,
here
's
Mr.
Babbitt
!
He
ai
n't
one
of
these
*NL*
ordinary
sports
!
He
's
a
real
guy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
boarded
and
rather
littered
cabin
the
guides
sat
about
the
*NL*
greasy
table
playing
stud-poker
with
greasy
cards
:
half
a
dozen
wrinkled
*NL*
men
in
old
trousers
and
easy
old
felt
hats
.
They
glanced
up
and
nodded
.
*NL*
Joe
Paradise
,
the
swart
aging
man
with
the
big
mustache
,
grunted
,
``
How
*NL*
do
.
Back
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
,
except
for
the
clatter
of
chips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
stood
beside
them
,
very
lonely
.
He
hinted
,
after
a
period
of
*NL*
highly
concentrated
playing
,
``
Guess
I
might
take
a
hand
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
Sit
in
.
How
many
chips
you
want
?
Let
's
see
;
you
were
here
with
*NL*
your
wife
,
last
year
,
wa
'n'
t
you
?
''
said
Joe
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
of
Babbitt
's
welcome
to
the
old
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
played
for
half
an
hour
before
he
spoke
again
.
His
head
was
reeking
*NL*
with
the
smoke
of
pipes
and
cheap
cigars
,
and
he
was
weary
of
pairs
and
*NL*
four-flushes
,
resentful
of
the
way
in
which
they
ignored
him
.
He
flung
*NL*
at
Joe
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Working
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
to
guide
me
for
a
few
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
jus
'
soon
.
I
ai
n't
engaged
till
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
thus
did
Joe
recognize
the
friendship
Babbitt
was
offering
him
.
*NL*
Babbitt
paid
up
his
losses
and
left
the
shack
rather
childishly
.
Joe
*NL*
raised
his
head
from
the
coils
of
smoke
like
a
seal
rising
from
surf
,
*NL*
grunted
,
``
I
'll
come
`
round
t
`
morrow
,
''
and
dived
down
to
his
three
aces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
in
his
voiceless
cabin
,
fragrant
with
planks
of
new-cut
pine
,
*NL*
nor
along
the
lake
,
nor
in
the
sunset
clouds
which
presently
eddied
*NL*
behind
the
lavender-misted
mountains
,
could
Babbitt
find
the
spirit
of
*NL*
Paul
as
a
reassuring
presence
.
He
was
so
lonely
that
after
supper
*NL*
he
stopped
to
talk
with
an
ancient
old
lady
,
a
gasping
and
steadily
*NL*
discoursing
old
lady
,
by
the
stove
in
the
hotel-office
.
He
told
her
of
*NL*
Ted
's
presumable
future
triumphs
in
the
State
University
and
of
Tinka
's
*NL*
remarkable
vocabulary
till
he
was
homesick
for
the
home
he
had
left
*NL*
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
darkness
,
through
that
Northern
pine-walled
silence
,
he
*NL*
blundered
down
to
the
lake-front
and
found
a
canoe
.
There
were
no
*NL*
paddles
in
it
but
with
a
board
,
sitting
awkwardly
amidships
and
poking
*NL*
at
the
water
rather
than
paddling
,
he
made
his
way
far
out
on
the
lake
.
*NL*
The
lights
of
the
hotel
and
the
cottages
became
yellow
dots
,
a
cluster
*NL*
of
glow-worms
at
the
base
of
Sachem
Mountain
.
Larger
and
ever
more
*NL*
imperturbable
was
the
mountain
in
the
star-filtered
darkness
,
and
the
*NL*
lake
a
limitless
pavement
of
black
marble
.
He
was
dwarfed
and
dumb
and
*NL*
a
little
awed
,
but
that
insignificance
freed
him
from
the
pomposities
of
*NL*
being
Mr.
George
F.
Babbitt
of
Zenith
;
saddened
and
freed
his
heart
.
*NL*
Now
he
was
conscious
of
the
presence
of
Paul
,
fancied
him
-LRB-
rescued
*NL*
from
prison
,
from
Zilla
and
the
brisk
exactitudes
of
the
tar-roofing
*NL*
business
-RRB-
playing
his
violin
at
the
end
of
the
canoe
.
He
vowed
,
``
I
will
*NL*
go
on
!
I
'll
never
go
back
!
Now
that
Paul
's
out
of
it
,
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
see
any
of
those
damn
people
again
!
I
was
a
fool
to
get
sore
because
Joe
*NL*
Paradise
did
n't
jump
up
and
hug
me
.
He
's
one
of
these
woodsmen
;
too
wise
*NL*
to
go
yelping
and
talking
your
arm
off
like
a
cityman
.
But
get
him
back
*NL*
in
the
mountains
,
out
on
the
trail
--
!
That
's
real
living
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
reported
at
Babbitt
's
cabin
at
nine
the
next
morning
.
Babbitt
*NL*
greeted
him
as
a
fellow
caveman
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Joe
,
how
d'
you
feel
about
hitting
the
trail
,
and
getting
away
*NL*
from
these
darn
soft
summerites
and
these
women
and
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
Mr.
Babbitt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
we
go
over
to
Box
Car
Pond
--
they
tell
me
the
shack
*NL*
there
is
n't
being
used
--
and
camp
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
Mr.
Babbitt
,
but
it
's
nearer
to
Skowtuit
Pond
,
and
you
*NL*
can
get
just
about
as
good
fishing
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
want
to
get
into
the
real
wilds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
put
the
old
packs
on
our
backs
and
get
into
the
woods
and
really
*NL*
hike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
maybe
it
would
be
easier
to
go
by
water
,
through
Lake
Chogue
.
*NL*
We
can
go
all
the
way
by
motor
boat
--
flat-bottom
boat
with
an
Evinrude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
!
Bust
up
the
quiet
with
a
chugging
motor
?
Not
on
your
life
!
You
*NL*
just
throw
a
pair
of
socks
in
the
old
pack
,
and
tell
'em
what
you
want
*NL*
for
eats
.
I
'll
be
ready
soon
's
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
of
the
sports
go
by
boat
,
Mr.
Babbitt
.
It
's
a
long
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Joe
:
are
you
objecting
to
walking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
guess
I
can
do
it
.
But
I
have
n't
tramped
that
far
for
sixteen
*NL*
years
.
Most
of
the
sports
go
by
boat
.
But
I
can
do
it
if
you
say
so
--
I
*NL*
guess
.
''
Joe
walked
away
in
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
recovered
from
his
touchy
wrath
before
Joe
returned
.
He
*NL*
pictured
him
as
warming
up
and
telling
the
most
entertaining
stories
.
*NL*
But
Joe
had
not
yet
warmed
up
when
they
took
the
trail
.
He
persistently
*NL*
kept
behind
Babbitt
,
and
however
much
his
shoulders
ached
from
the
pack
,
*NL*
however
sorely
he
panted
,
Babbitt
could
hear
his
guide
panting
equally
.
*NL*
But
the
trail
was
satisfying
:
a
path
brown
with
pine-needles
and
rough
*NL*
with
roots
,
among
the
balsams
,
the
ferns
,
the
sudden
groves
of
white
*NL*
birch
.
He
became
credulous
again
,
and
rejoiced
in
sweating
.
When
he
*NL*
stopped
to
rest
he
chuckled
,
``
Guess
we
're
hitting
it
up
pretty
good
for
*NL*
a
couple
o
'
old
birds
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh-huh
,
''
admitted
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
mighty
pretty
place
.
Look
,
you
can
see
the
lake
down
through
*NL*
the
trees
.
I
tell
you
,
Joe
,
you
do
n't
appreciate
how
lucky
you
are
to
*NL*
live
in
woods
like
this
,
instead
of
a
city
with
trolleys
grinding
and
*NL*
typewriters
clacking
and
people
bothering
the
life
out
of
you
all
the
*NL*
time
!
I
wish
I
knew
the
woods
like
you
do
.
Say
,
what
's
the
name
of
that
*NL*
little
red
flower
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rubbing
his
back
,
Joe
regarded
the
flower
resentfully
``
Well
,
some
folks
*NL*
call
it
one
thing
and
some
calls
it
another
I
always
just
call
it
Pink
*NL*
Flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
blessedly
ceased
thinking
as
tramping
turned
into
blind
*NL*
plodding
.
He
was
submerged
in
weariness
.
His
plump
legs
seemed
to
go
*NL*
on
by
themselves
,
without
guidance
,
and
he
mechanically
wiped
away
the
*NL*
sweat
which
stung
his
eyes
.
He
was
too
tired
to
be
consciously
glad
as
,
*NL*
after
a
sun-scourged
mile
of
corduroy
tote-road
through
a
swamp
where
*NL*
flies
hovered
over
a
hot
waste
of
brush
,
they
reached
the
cool
shore
of
*NL*
Box
Car
Pond
.
When
he
lifted
the
pack
from
his
back
he
staggered
from
*NL*
the
change
in
balance
,
and
for
a
moment
could
not
stand
erect
.
He
lay
*NL*
beneath
an
ample-bosomed
maple
tree
near
the
guest-shack
,
and
joyously
*NL*
felt
sleep
running
through
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
awoke
toward
dusk
,
to
find
Joe
efficiently
cooking
bacon
and
eggs
and
*NL*
flapjacks
for
supper
,
and
his
admiration
of
the
woodsman
returned
.
He
*NL*
sat
on
a
stump
and
felt
virile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
,
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
a
lot
of
money
?
Would
you
stick
*NL*
to
guiding
,
or
would
you
take
a
claim
`
way
back
in
the
woods
and
be
*NL*
independent
of
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
Joe
brightened
.
He
chewed
his
cud
a
second
,
and
*NL*
bubbled
,
``
I
've
often
thought
of
that
!
If
I
had
the
money
,
I
'd
go
down
to
*NL*
Tinker
's
Falls
and
open
a
swell
shoe
store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
Joe
proposed
a
game
of
stud-poker
but
Babbitt
refused
with
*NL*
brevity
,
and
Joe
contentedly
went
to
bed
at
eight
.
Babbitt
sat
on
the
*NL*
stump
,
facing
the
dark
pond
,
slapping
mosquitos
.
Save
the
snoring
guide
,
*NL*
there
was
no
other
human
being
within
ten
miles
.
He
was
lonelier
than
he
*NL*
had
ever
been
in
his
life
.
Then
he
was
in
Zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
worrying
as
to
whether
Miss
McGoun
was
n't
paying
too
much
for
*NL*
carbon
paper
.
He
was
at
once
resenting
and
missing
the
persistent
*NL*
teasing
at
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
.
He
was
wondering
what
Zilla
Riesling
*NL*
was
doing
now
.
He
was
wondering
whether
,
after
the
summer
's
maturity
*NL*
of
being
a
garageman
,
Ted
would
``
get
busy
''
in
the
university
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
of
his
wife
.
``
If
she
would
only
--
if
she
would
n't
be
so
darn
*NL*
satisfied
with
just
settling
down
--
No
!
I
wo
n't
!
I
wo
n't
go
back
!
I
'll
*NL*
be
fifty
in
three
years
.
Sixty
in
thirteen
years
.
I
'm
going
to
have
some
*NL*
fun
before
it
's
too
late
.
I
do
n't
care
!
I
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
Ida
Putiak
,
of
Louetta
Swanson
,
of
that
nice
widow
--
what
*NL*
was
her
name
?
--
Tanis
Judique
?
--
the
one
for
whom
he
'd
found
the
flat
.
He
*NL*
was
enmeshed
in
imaginary
conversations
.
Then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
,
I
ca
n't
seem
to
get
away
from
thinking
about
folks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
came
to
him
merely
to
run
away
was
folly
,
because
he
could
never
*NL*
run
away
from
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
moment
he
started
for
Zenith
.
In
his
journey
there
was
no
*NL*
appearance
of
flight
,
but
he
was
fleeing
,
and
four
days
afterward
he
was
*NL*
on
the
Zenith
train
.
He
knew
that
he
was
slinking
back
not
because
it
*NL*
was
what
he
longed
to
do
but
because
it
was
all
he
could
do
.
He
scanned
*NL*
again
his
discovery
that
he
could
never
run
away
from
Zenith
and
family
*NL*
and
office
,
because
in
his
own
brain
he
bore
the
office
and
the
family
*NL*
and
every
street
and
disquiet
and
illusion
of
Zenith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
going
to
--
oh
,
I
'm
going
to
start
something
!
''
he
vowed
,
and
he
*NL*
tried
to
make
it
valiant
.

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
through
the
train
,
looking
for
familiar
faces
,
he
saw
only
*NL*
one
person
whom
he
knew
,
and
that
was
Seneca
Doane
,
the
lawyer
who
,
*NL*
after
the
blessings
of
being
in
Babbitt
's
own
class
at
college
and
*NL*
of
becoming
a
corporation-counsel
,
had
turned
crank
,
had
headed
*NL*
farmer-labor
tickets
and
fraternized
with
admitted
socialists
.
Though
he
*NL*
was
in
rebellion
,
naturally
Babbitt
did
not
care
to
be
seen
talking
*NL*
with
such
a
fanatic
,
but
in
all
the
Pullmans
he
could
find
no
other
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
reluctantly
he
halted
.
Seneca
Doane
was
a
slight
,
*NL*
thin-haired
man
,
rather
like
Chum
Frink
except
that
he
had
n't
Frink
's
*NL*
grin
.
He
was
reading
a
book
called
``
The
Way
of
All
Flesh
.
''
It
looked
*NL*
religious
to
Babbitt
,
and
he
wondered
if
Doane
could
possibly
have
been
*NL*
converted
and
turned
decent
and
patriotic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hello
,
Doane
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doane
looked
up
.
His
voice
was
curiously
kind
.
``
Oh
!
How
do
,
Babbitt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
away
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
been
in
Washington

*NL*
*NL*
``
Washington

How
's
the
old
Government
making
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's

Wo
n't
you
sit
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
.
Do
n't
care
if
I
do
.
Well
,
well
!
Been
quite
a
while
since
I
've
*NL*
had
a
good
chance
to
talk
to
you
,
Doane
.
I
was
,
uh

Sorry
you
did
n't
*NL*
turn
up
at
the
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh-thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
unions
coming
?
Going
to
run
for
mayor
again
?
''
Doane
seemed
*NL*
restless
.
He
was
fingering
the
pages
of
his
book
.
He
said
``
I
might
''
as
*NL*
though
it
did
n't
mean
anything
in
particular
,
and
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
liked
that
smile
,
and
hunted
for
conversation
:
``
Saw
a
bang-up
*NL*
cabaret
in
New
York
:
the
`
Good-Morning
Cutie
'
bunch
at
the
Hotel

Minton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

there
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally

I
like

do

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
gosh

Doane

from

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Not

I

held
at
the
Ritz

with

dance
afterward

that

*NL*

have
no

you

good
for
the

I
remember
--
in
college
you
were
an
unusually
*NL*
liberal

sensitive
chap

I
can
still
recall
your
saying
to
me
that
you

were
going
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
take
the
cases
of
the
poor
for
nothing

fight
the

I
remember
I
said
I
was
going
to
be
one
of
*NL*
the
rich
myself
,
and
buy
paintings
and
live
at
Newport

I

sure
you

inspired
us
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
...
Well

I
've
always
aimed
to
be
liberal

''
Babbitt
was
*NL*
enormously
shy
and
proud
and
self-conscious
;
he
tried
to
look
like
the
*NL*
boy
he
had
been
a
quarter-century
ago
,
and
he
shone
upon
his
old
friend
*NL*
Seneca
Doane
as
he
rumbled
,
``
Trouble
with
a
lot
of
these
fellows

even

some
of
'em
that

're
forward-looking

is
*NL*
they
are
n't
broad-minded

liberal

Now
,
I
always
believe
in
giving

the
other

a
chance

listening
to
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

``
Tell
you
how
I
figure
it

good
for

a
fellow
,
especially
if
he
's
a
business
man
and
engaged
in
doing
the
*NL*
work
of
the
world

ought
to
be
liberal

*NL*
``
Yes

pretty

I
just
let

go
right
on

is
nice

*NL*

we

it

Not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ingram
?
But
,
why
,
he
's
this
nut
preacher
that
got
kicked
out
of
*NL*
the
Congregationalist
Church
,
is
n't
he
,
and
preaches
free
love
and
*NL*
sedition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
Doane
explained
,
was
indeed
the
general
conception
of
Beecher
*NL*
Ingram
,
but
he
himself
saw
Beecher
Ingram
as
a
priest
of
the
brotherhood
*NL*
of
man
,
of
which
Babbitt
was
notoriously
an
upholder
.
So
would
Babbitt
*NL*
keep
his
acquaintances
from
hounding
Ingram
and
his
forlorn
little
*NL*
church
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
!
I
'll
call
down
any
of
the
boys
I
hear
getting
funny
about
*NL*
Ingram
,
''
Babbitt
said
affectionately
to
his
dear
friend
Doane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doane
warmed
up
and
became
reminiscent
.
He
spoke
of
student
days
in
*NL*
Germany
,
of
lobbying
for
single
tax
in
Washington
,
of
international
*NL*
labor
conferences
.
He
mentioned
his
friends
,
Lord
Wycombe
,
Colonel
*NL*
Wedgwood
,
Professor
Piccoli
.
Babbitt
had
always
supposed
that
Doane
*NL*
associated
only
with
the
I.
W.
W.
,
but
now
he
nodded
gravely
,
as
one
*NL*
who
knew
Lord
Wycombes
by
the
score
,
and
he
got
in
two
references
to
Sir
*NL*
Gerald
Doak
.
He
felt
daring
and
idealistic
and
cosmopolitan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
in
his
new
spiritual
grandeur
,
he
was
sorry
for
Zilla
*NL*
Riesling
,
and
understood
her
as
these
ordinary
fellows
at
the
Boosters
'
*NL*
Club
never
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Five
hours
after
he
had
arrived
in
Zenith
and
told
his
wife
how
hot
it
*NL*
was
in
New
York
,
he
went
to
call
on
Zilla
.
He
was
buzzing
with
ideas
and
*NL*
forgiveness
.
He
'd
get
Paul
released
;
he
'd
do
things
,
vague
but
highly
*NL*
benevolent
things
,
for
Zilla
;
he
'd
be
as
generous
as
his
friend
Seneca
*NL*
Doane
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
seen
Zilla
since
Paul
had
shot
her
,
and
he
still
pictured
her
*NL*
as
buxom
,
high-colored
,
lively
,
and
a
little
blowsy
.
As
he
drove
up
*NL*
to
her
boarding-house
,
in
a
depressing
back
street
below
the
wholesale
*NL*
district
,
he
stopped
in
discomfort
.
At
an
upper
window
,
leaning
on
her
*NL*
elbow
,
was
a
woman
with
the
features
of
Zilla
,
but
she
was
bloodless
*NL*
and
aged
,
like
a
yellowed
wad
of
old
paper
crumpled
into
wrinkles
.
Where
*NL*
Zilla
had
bounced
and
jiggled
,
this
woman
was
dreadfully
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
half
an
hour
before
she
came
into
the
boarding-house
parlor
.
*NL*
Fifty
times
he
opened
the
book
of
photographs
of
the
Chicago
World
's
*NL*
Fair
of
1893
,
fifty
times
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
the
Court
of
*NL*
Honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
startled
to
find
Zilla
in
the
room
.
She
wore
a
black
streaky
gown
*NL*
which
she
had
tried
to
brighten
with
a
girdle
of
crimson
ribbon
.
The
*NL*
ribbon
had
been
torn
and
patiently
mended
.
He
noted
this
carefully
,
*NL*
because
he
did
not
wish
to
look
at
her
shoulders
.
One
shoulder
was
lower
*NL*
than
the
other
;
one
arm
she
carried
in
contorted
fashion
,
as
though
it
*NL*
were
paralyzed
;
and
behind
a
high
collar
of
cheap
lace
there
was
a
gouge
*NL*
in
the
anemic
neck
which
had
once
been
shining
and
softly
plump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
old
Zilla
!
By
golly
,
it
's
good
to
see
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
send
his
messages
through
a
lawyer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
rats
,
Zilla
,
I
did
n't
come
just
because
of
him
.
Came
as
an
old
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
waited
long
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
how
it
is
.
Figured
you
would
n't
want
to
see
a
friend
of
*NL*
his
for
quite
some
time
and
--
Sit
down
,
honey
!
Let
's
be
sensible
.
We
've
*NL*
all
of
us
done
a
bunch
of
things
that
we
had
n't
ought
to
,
but
maybe
we
*NL*
can
sort
of
start
over
again
.
Honest
,
Zilla
,
I
'd
like
to
do
something
to
*NL*
make
you
both
happy
.
Know
what
I
thought
to-day
?
Mind
you
,
Paul
does
n't
*NL*
know
a
thing
about
this
--
does
n't
know
I
was
going
to
come
see
you
.
I
got
*NL*
to
thinking
:
Zilla
's
a
fine
?
big-hearted
woman
,
and
she
'll
understand
*NL*
that
,
uh
,
Paul
's
had
his
lesson
now
.
Why
would
n't
it
be
a
fine
idea
if
*NL*
you
asked
the
governor
to
pardon
him
?
Believe
he
would
,
if
it
came
from
*NL*
you
.
No
!
Wait
!
Just
think
how
good
you
'd
feel
if
you
were
generous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
wish
to
be
generous

''
She
was
sitting
primly
,
speaking
icily
.
*NL*
``
For
that
reason
I
wish
to
keep
him
in
prison
,
as
an
example
to
*NL*
evil-doers

I
've
gotten
religion

George
,
since
the
terrible
thing
that
*NL*
man
did
to
me
.
Sometimes
I
used
to
be
unkind
,
and
I
wished
for
worldly
*NL*
pleasures
,
for
dancing
and
the
theater
.
But
when
I
was
in
the
hospital
*NL*
the
pastor
of
the
Pentecostal
Communion
Faith
used
to
come
to
see
me
,
*NL*
and
he
showed
me
,
right
from
the
prophecies
written
in
the
Word
of
God
,
*NL*
that
the
Day
of
Judgment
is
coming
and
all
the
members
of
the
older
*NL*
churches
are
going
straight
to
eternal
damnation

because
they
only
do
*NL*
lip-service

swallow
the
world

the
flesh

*NL*
*NL*
For
fifteen
wild
minutes
she
talked
,
pouring
out
admonitions
to
flee
the
*NL*
wrath
to
come
,
and
her
face
flushed
,
her
dead
voice
recaptured
something
*NL*
of
the
shrill
energy
of
the
old
Zilla
.
She
wound
up
with
a
furious
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
blessing
of
God
himself
that
Paul
should
be
in
prison
now
,
and
*NL*
torn
and
humbled
by
punishment
,
so
that
he
may
yet
save
his
soul
,
and
so
*NL*
other
wicked
men
,
these
horrible
chasers
after
women
and
lust
,
may
have
*NL*
an
example

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
had
itched
and
twisted
.
As
in
church
he
dared
not
move
during
*NL*
the
sermon
so
now
he
felt
that
he
must
seem
attentive
,
though
her
*NL*
screeching
denunciations
flew
past
him
like
carrion
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*

sought
to
be
calm
and
brotherly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

charitable

n't
it

me
tell
you
how
I
figure
it

What
we

liberalism

liberality

liberal

was
very
much

old
Zilla

broad-minded

going

having

me

my
wickedness

's
getting
his

good
and

for
the
cruel
*NL*
things
he
did
to
me

and
I
hope
he
DIES
in
prison
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
up
,
hat
in
hand
,
growling
,
``
Well
,
if
that
's
what
you
call
*NL*
being
at
peace

for

just

III
*NL*
*NL*
Vast
is
the
power
of
cities
to
reclaim
the
wanderer
.
More
than
mountains
*NL*
or
the
shore-devouring
sea
,
a
city
retains
its
character
,
imperturbable
,
*NL*
cynical
,
holding
behind
apparent
changes
its
essential
purpose
.
Though
*NL*
Babbitt
had
deserted
his
family
and
dwelt
with
Joe
Paradise
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
though
he
had
become
a
liberal
,
though
he
had
been
quite
*NL*
sure
,
on
the
night
before
he
reached
Zenith
,
that
neither
he
nor
the
*NL*
city
would
be
the
same
again
,
ten
days
after
his
return
he
could
not
*NL*
believe
that
he
had
ever
been
away
.
Nor
was
it
at
all
evident
to
his
*NL*
acquaintances
that
there
was
a
new
George
F.
Babbitt
,
save
that
he
was
*NL*
more
irritable
under
the
incessant
chaffing
at
the
Athletic
Club
,
and
*NL*
once
,
when
Vergil
Gunch
observed
that
Seneca
Doane
ought
to
be
hanged
,
*NL*
Babbitt
snorted
,
``
Oh
,
rats
,
he
's
not
so
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
he
grunted
``
Eh
?
''
across
the
newspaper
to
his
commentatory
wife
,
*NL*
and
was
delighted
by
Tinka
's
new
red
tam
o'shanter
,
and
announced
,
``
No
*NL*
class
to
that
corrugated
iron
garage
.
Have
to
build
me
a
nice
frame
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Verona
and
Kenneth
Escott
appeared
really
to
be
engaged
.
In
*NL*
his
newspaper
Escott
had
conducted
a
pure-food
crusade
against
*NL*
commission-houses
.
As
a
result
he
had
been
given
an
excellent
job
in
a
*NL*
commission-house
,
and
he
was
making
a
salary
on
which
he
could
marry
,
*NL*
and
denouncing
irresponsible
reporters
who
wrote
stories
criticizing
*NL*
commission-houses
without
knowing
what
they
were
talking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
September
Ted
had
entered
the
State
University
as
a
freshman
in
the
*NL*
College
of
Arts
and
Sciences
.
The
university
was
at
Mohalis
only
fifteen
*NL*
miles
from
Zenith
,
and
Ted
often
came
down
for
the
week-end
.
Babbitt
was
*NL*
worried
.
Ted
was
``
going
in
for
''
everything
but
books
.
He
had
tried
to
*NL*
``
make
''
the
football
team
as
a
light
half-back
,
he
was
looking
forward
*NL*
to
the
basket-ball
season
,
he
was
on
the
committee
for
the
Freshman
*NL*
Hop
,
and
-LRB-
as
a
Zenithite
,
an
aristocrat
among
the
yokels
-RRB-
he
was
being
*NL*
``
rushed
''
by
two
fraternities
.
But
of
his
studies
Babbitt
could
learn
*NL*
nothing
save
a
mumbled
,
``
Oh
,
gosh
,
these
old
stiffs
of
teachers
just
*NL*
give
you
a
lot
of
junk
about
literature
and
economics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
week-end
Ted
proposed
,
``
Say
,
Dad
,
why
ca
n't
I
transfer
over
from
the
*NL*
College
to
the
School
of
Engineering
and
take
mechanical
engineering
?
*NL*
You
always
holler
that
I
never
study
,
but
honest
,
I
would
study
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
the
Engineering
School
has
n't
got
the
standing
the
College
has
,
''
*NL*
fretted
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
how
it
has
n't
!
The
Engineers
can
play
on
any
of
the
*NL*
teams
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
explanation
of
the
``
dollars-and-cents
value
of
being
*NL*
known
as
a
college
man
when
you
go
into
the
law
,
''
and
a
truly
oratorical
*NL*
account
of
the
lawyer
's
life
.
Before
he
was
through
with
it
,
Babbitt
had
*NL*
Ted
a
United
States
Senator
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
great
lawyers
whom
he
mentioned
was
Seneca
Doane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
gee
whiz
,
''
Ted
marveled
,
``
I
thought
you
always
said
this
Doane
was
*NL*
a
reg
`
lar
nut
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
no
way
to
speak
of
a
great
man
!
Doane
's
always
been
a
good
*NL*
friend
of
mine
--
fact
I
helped
him
in
college
--
I
started
him
out
and
you
*NL*
might
say
inspired
him
.
Just
because
he
's
sympathetic
with
the
aims
of
*NL*
Labor
,
a
lot
of
chumps
that
lack
liberality
and
broad-mindedness
think
*NL*
he
's
a
crank
,
but
let
me
tell
you
there
's
mighty
few
of
'em
that
rake
*NL*
in
the
fees
he
does
,
and
he
's
a
friend
of
some
of
the
strongest
;
most
*NL*
conservative
men
in
the
world
--
like
Lord
Wycombe
,
this
,
uh
,
this
big
*NL*
English
nobleman
that
's
so
well
known

And
you
now
,
which
would
you
*NL*
rather
do
:
be
in
with
a
lot
of
greasy
mechanics
and
laboring-men
,
or
*NL*
chum
up
to
a
real
fellow
like
Lord
Wycombe
,
and
get
invited
to
his
house
*NL*
for
parties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
gosh
,
''
sighed
Ted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
week-end
he
came
in
joyously
with
,
``
Say
,
Dad
,
why
could
n't
I
*NL*
take
mining
engineering
instead
of
the
academic
course

You
talk
about

standing

maybe
there
is
n't
much
in
mechanical
engineering

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
strike
which
turned
Zenith
into
two
belligerent
camps
;
white
and
*NL*
red
,
began
late
in
September
with
a
walk-out
of
telephone
girls
and
*NL*
linemen
,
in
protest
against
a
reduction
of
wages
.
The
newly
formed
union
*NL*
of
dairy-products
workers
went
out
,
partly
in
sympathy
and
partly
*NL*
in
demand
for
a
forty-four
hour
week
.
They
were
followed
by
the
*NL*
truck-drivers
'
union
.
Industry
was
tied
up
,
and
the
whole
city
was
*NL*
nervous
with
talk
of
a
trolley
strike
,
a
printers
'
strike
,
a
general
*NL*
strike
.
Furious
citizens
,
trying
to
get
telephone
calls
through
*NL*
strike-breaking
girls
,
danced
helplessly
.
Every
truck
that
made
its
way
*NL*
from
the
factories
to
the
freight-stations
was
guarded
by
a
policeman
,
*NL*
trying
to
look
stoical
beside
the
scab
driver
.
A
line
of
fifty
*NL*
trucks
from
the
Zenith
Steel
and
Machinery
Company
was
attacked
by
*NL*
strikers-rushing
out
from
the
sidewalk
,
pulling
drivers
from
the
seats
,
*NL*
smashing
carburetors
and
commutators
,
while
telephone
girls
cheered
from
*NL*
the
walk
,
and
small
boys
heaved
bricks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
National
Guard
was
ordered
out
.
Colonel
Nixon
,
who
in
private
life
*NL*
was
Mr.
Caleb
Nixon
,
secretary
of
the
Pullmore
Tractor
Company
,
put
on
*NL*
a
long
khaki
coat
and
stalked
through
crowds
,
a
.44
automatic
in
hand
.
*NL*
Even
Babbitt
's
friend
,
Clarence
Drum
the
shoe
merchant
--
a
round
and
*NL*
merry
man
who
told
stories
at
the
Athletic
Club
,
and
who
strangely
*NL*
resembled
a
Victorian
pug-dog
--
was
to
be
seen
as
a
waddling
but
*NL*
ferocious
captain
,
with
his
belt
tight
about
his
comfortable
little
*NL*
belly
,
and
his
round
little
mouth
petulant
as
he
piped
to
chattering
*NL*
groups
on
corners
.
``
Move
on
there
now
!
I
ca
n't
have
any
of
this
*NL*
loitering
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
newspaper
in
the
city
,
save
one
,
was
against
the
strikers
.
When
*NL*
mobs
raided
the
news-stands
,
at
each
was
stationed
a
militiaman
,
a
*NL*
young
,
embarrassed
citizen-soldier
with
eye-glasses
,
bookkeeper
or
*NL*
grocery-clerk
in
private
life
,
trying
to
look
dangerous
while
small
boys
*NL*
yelped
,
``
Get
onto
de
tin
soldier
!
''
and
striking
truck-drivers
inquired
*NL*
tenderly
,
``
Say
,
Joe
,
when
I
was
fighting
in
France
,
was
you
in
camp
*NL*
in
the
States
or
was
you
doing
Swede
exercises
in
the
Y.
M.
C.
A.
?
Be
*NL*
careful
of
that
bayonet
,
now
,
or
you
'll
cut
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
Zenith
who
talked
of
anything
but
the
strike
,
and
*NL*
no
one
who
did
not
take
sides
.
You
were
either
a
courageous
friend
of
*NL*
Labor
,
or
you
were
a
fearless
supporter
of
the
Rights
of
Property
;
and
*NL*
in
either
case
you
were
belligerent
,
and
ready
to
disown
any
friend
who
*NL*
did
not
hate
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
condensed-milk
plant
was
set
afire
--
each
side
charged
it
to
the
*NL*
other
--
and
the
city
was
hysterical
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Babbitt
chose
this
time
to
be
publicly
liberal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
belonged
to
the
sound
,
sane
,
right-thinking
wing
,
and
at
first
he
*NL*
agreed
that
the
Crooked
Agitators
ought
to
be
shot
.
He
was
sorry
when
*NL*
his
friend
,
Seneca
Doane
,
defended
arrested
strikers
,
and
he
thought
of
*NL*
going
to
Doane
and
explaining
about
these
agitators
,
but
when
he
read
a
*NL*
broadside
alleging
that
even
on
their
former
wages
the
telephone
girls
*NL*
had
been
hungry
,
he
was
troubled
.
``
All
lies
and
fake
figures
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
but
in
a
doubtful
croak
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
Sunday
after
,
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
Church
announced
a
*NL*
sermon
by
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
on
``
How
the
Saviour
Would
End
Strikes
.
''
*NL*
Babbitt
had
been
negligent
about
church-going
lately
,
but
he
went
to
*NL*
the
service
,
hopeful
that
Dr.
Drew
really
did
have
the
information
as
*NL*
to
what
the
divine
powers
thought
about
strikes
.
Beside
Babbitt
in
the
*NL*
large
,
curving
,
glossy
,
velvet-upholstered
pew
was
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
whispered
,
``
Hope
the
doc
gives
the
strikers
hell
!
Ordinarily
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
believe
in
a
preacher
butting
into
political
matters
--
let
him
*NL*
stick
to
straight
religion
and
save
souls
,
and
not
stir
up
a
lot
of
*NL*
discussion
--
but
at
a
time
like
this
,
I
do
think
he
ought
to
stand
right
*NL*
up
and
bawl
out
those
plug-uglies
to
a
fare-you-well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
well
--
''
said
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rev.
Dr.
Drew
,
his
rustic
bang
flopping
with
the
intensity
of
his
*NL*
poetic
and
sociologic
ardor
,
trumpeted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
During
the
untoward
series
of
industrial
dislocations
which
have
--
let
*NL*
us
be
courageous
and
admit
it
boldly
--
throttled
the
business
life
of
*NL*
our
fair
city
these
past
days
,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
loose
talk
*NL*
about
scientific
prevention
of
scientific
--
SCIENTIFIC
!
Now
,
let
me
tell
*NL*
you
that
the
most
unscientific
thing
in
the
world
is
science
!
Take
the
*NL*
attacks
on
the
established
fundamentals
of
the
Christian
creed
which
*NL*
were
so
popular
with
the
`
scientists
'
a
generation
ago
.
Oh
,
yes
,
they
*NL*
were
mighty
fellows
,
and
great
poo-bahs
of
criticism
!
They
were
going
to
*NL*
destroy
the
church
;
they
were
going
to
prove
the
world
was
created
and
*NL*
has
been
brought
to
its
extraordinary
level
of
morality
and
civilization
*NL*
by
blind
chance
.
Yet
the
church
stands
just
as
firmly
to-day
as
ever
,
*NL*
and
the
only
answer
a
Christian
pastor
needs
make
to
the
long-haired
*NL*
opponents
of
his
simple
faith
is
just
a
pitying
smile
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
these
same
`
scientists
'
want
to
replace
the
natural
condition
*NL*
of
free
competition
by
crazy
systems
which
,
no
matter
by
what
*NL*
high-sounding
names
they
are
called
,
are
nothing
but
a
despotic
*NL*
paternalism
.
Naturally
,
I
'm
not
criticizing
labor
courts
,
injunctions
*NL*
against
men
proven
to
be
striking
unjustly
,
or
those
excellent
unions
in
*NL*
which
the
men
and
the
boss
get
together
.
But
I
certainly
am
criticizing
*NL*
the
systems
in
which
the
free
and
fluid
motivation
of
independent
labor
*NL*
is
to
be
replaced
by
cooked-up
wage-scales
and
minimum
salaries
and
*NL*
government
commissions
and
labor
federations
and
all
that
poppycock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
not
generally
understood
is
that
this
whole
industrial
matter
*NL*
is
n't
a
question
of
economics
.
It
's
essentially
and
only
a
matter
*NL*
of
Love
,
and
of
the
practical
application
of
the
Christian
religion
!
*NL*
Imagine
a
factory
--
instead
of
committees
of
workmen
alienating
the
boss
,
*NL*
the
boss
goes
among
them
smiling
,
and
they
smile
back
,
the
elder
brother
*NL*
and
the
younger
.
Brothers
,
that
's
what
they
must
be
,
loving
brothers
,
*NL*
and
then
strikes
would
be
as
inconceivable
as
hatred
in
the
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
point
that
Babbitt
muttered
,
``
Oh
,
rot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
?
''
said
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
know
what
he
's
talking
about

It
's
just
as
clear
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Frink
looked
at
him
doubtfully

through
all
the
service
kept
glancing
at

him
doubtfully
,
till
Babbitt
was
nervous

*NL*
The
strikers
had
announced
a
parade
for
Tuesday
morning
,
but
Colonel
*NL*
Nixon
had
forbidden
it
,
the
newspapers
said
.
When
Babbitt
drove
west
*NL*
from
his
office
at
ten
that
morning
he
saw
a
drove
of
shabby
men
heading
*NL*
toward
the
tangled
,
dirty
district
beyond
Court
House
Square
.
He
hated
*NL*
them
,
because
they
were
poor
,
because
they
made
him
feel
insecure
``
Damn
*NL*
loafers
!
Would
n't
be
common
workmen
if
they
had
any
pep
,
''
he
complained
.
*NL*
He
wondered
if
there
was
going
to
be
a
riot
.
He
drove
toward
the
*NL*
starting-point
of
the
parade
,
a
triangle
of
limp
and
faded
grass
known
*NL*
as
Moore
Street
Park
,
and
halted
his
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
park
and
streets
were
buzzing
with
strikers
,
young
men
in
blue
denim
*NL*
shirts
,
old
men
with
caps
.
Through
them
,
keeping
them
stirred
like
a
*NL*
boiling
pot
,
moved
the
militiamen
.
Babbitt
could
hear
the
soldiers
'
*NL*
monotonous
orders
:
``
Keep
moving
--
move
on
,
`
bo
--
keep
your
feet
warm
!
''
*NL*
Babbitt
admired
their
stolid
good
temper
.
The
crowd
shouted
,
``
Tin
*NL*
soldiers
,
''
and
``
Dirty
dogs
--
servants
of
the
capitalists
!
''
but
the
*NL*
militiamen
grinned
and
answered
only
,
``
Sure
,
that
's
right
.
Keep
moving
,
*NL*
Billy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
thrilled
over
the
citizen-soldiers
,
hated
the
scoundrels
who
*NL*
were
obstructing
the
pleasant
ways
of
prosperity
,
admired
Colonel
*NL*
Nixon
's
striding
contempt
for
the
crowd
;
and
as
Captain
Clarence
Drum
,
*NL*
that
rather
puffing
shoe-dealer
,
came
raging
by
,
Babbitt
respectfully
*NL*
clamored
,
``
Great
work
,
Captain
!
Do
n't
let
'em
march
!
''
He
watched
the
*NL*
strikers
filing
from
the
park
.
Many
of
them
bore
posters
with
``
They
*NL*
ca
n't
stop
our
peacefully
walking
.
''
The
militiamen
tore
away
the
*NL*
posters
,
but
the
strikers
fell
in
behind
their
leaders
and
straggled
*NL*
off
,
a
thin
unimpressive
trickle
between
steel-glinting
lines
of
*NL*
soldiers
.
Babbitt
saw
with
disappointment
that
there
was
n't
going
to
be
*NL*
any
violence
,
nothing
interesting
at
all
.
Then
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
marchers
,
beside
a
bulky
young
workman
,
was
Seneca
Doane
,
*NL*
smiling
,
content
.
In
front
of
him
was
Professor
Brockbank
,
head
of
*NL*
the
history
department
in
the
State
University
,
an
old
man
and
*NL*
white-bearded
,
known
to
come
from
a
distinguished
Massachusetts
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
gosh
,
''
Babbitt
marveled
,
``
a
swell
like
him
in
with
the
strikers
?
*NL*
And
good
ole
Senny
Doane
!
They
're
fools
to
get
mixed
up
with
this
bunch
.
*NL*
They
're
parlor
socialists
!
But
they
have
got
nerve
.
And
nothing
in
it
*NL*
for
them
,
not
a
cent
!
And
--
I
do
n't
know
's
ALL
the
strikers
look
like
*NL*
such
tough
nuts
.
Look
just
about
like
anybody
else
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
militiamen
were
turning
the
parade
down
a
side
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
got
just
as
much
right
to
march
as
anybody
else
!
They
own
the
*NL*
streets
as
much
as
Clarence
Drum
or
the
American
Legion
does

''
Babbitt
*NL*
grumbled
.
``
Of
course
,
they
're

they
're
a
bad
element

Oh

rats

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Athletic
Club
,
Babbitt
was
silent
during
lunch
,
while
the
others
*NL*
fretted
,
``
I
do
n't
know
what
the
world
's
coming

solaced
their
*NL*
spirits

*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Clarence
Drum
came
swinging
by
,
splendid
in
khaki
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
it
going

Captain
?
''
inquired
Vergil
Gunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
got
'em
stopped

We
worked

off
on

discouraged

went
home

``

No

``

Mr.

.
``
If
I
had
my
way

there
'd
be
a

I

it

then
the

be
over

I
do

believe
in
standing
back
and
wet-nursing
these

letting
the
disturbances
drag
on

I
tell
you
these
strikers
are
*NL*
nothing
in
God

world

a

of
bomb-throwing
socialists
and
thugs
,
*NL*
and
the
only
way
to
handle
'em
is
with
a
club

That
's
what
I
'd
do

beat

up

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
heard
himself
saying
,
``

Clarence

they
look
just
about

*NL*
Drum
complained

you
did
n't

Well

maybe
you
'd

Just
tell
Colonel

Drum
strode
on
,
while
all
*NL*
the
table
stared
at
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
idea
?
Do
you
want

give

hell-hounds

Orville
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

away

raged
Professor
Pumphrey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
intimidatingly
said
nothing
.
He
put
on
sternness
like
a
*NL*
mask
;
his
jaw
was
hard
,
his
bristly
short
hair
seemed
cruel
,
his
silence
*NL*
was
a
ferocious
thunder

While
the
others
assured
Babbitt
that
they
must
*NL*
have
misunderstood
him
,
Gunch
looked
as
though
he
had
understood
only
*NL*
too
well
.
Like
a
robed
judge
he
listened
to
Babbitt
's
stammering
:

*NL*
``
No

's
bad
policy
to
talk
about
clubbing
'em

Cabe
Nixon
does
n't
.
He
's
*NL*
got
the
fine
Italian
hand

that

why
he

jealous

*NL*
``

said
Professor

``
you

been
out

*NL*
*NL*
Gunch
said
nothing

watched

watched

As
he
was
leaving

Babbitt
heard
Chum
Frink
protesting
to
Gunch
,
*NL*
''
--
do
n't
know
what
's
got
into

Last
Sunday
Doc
Drew
preached
a
*NL*
corking
sermon
about
decency
in
business
and
Babbitt
kicked
about
that
,
*NL*
too
.
Near

I
can
figure
out

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
vaguely
frightened
.

IV
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
a
crowd
listening
to
a
man
who
was
talking
from
the
rostrum
of
a
*NL*
kitchen-chair
.
He
stopped
his
car
.
From
newspaper
pictures
he
knew
that
*NL*
the
speaker
must
be
the
notorious
freelance
preacher
,
Beecher
Ingram
,
*NL*
of
whom
Seneca
Doane
had
spoken
.
Ingram
was
a
gaunt
man
with
flamboyant
*NL*
hair
,
weather-beaten
cheeks
,
and
worried
eyes
.
He
was
pleading
:
*NL*

''
--

telephone
girls
can
hold
out

living
on
one
meal
a
day
,

starving
and
smiling

hulking
men

to
be
able

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
saw
that
from
the
sidewalk
Vergil
Gunch
was
watching
him
.
In
*NL*
vague
disquiet
he
started
the
car
and
mechanically
drove
on
,
while
*NL*
Gunch
's
hostile
eyes
seemed
to
follow
him
all
the
way

``
There

The
voice
of
Tanis
Judique
was

pleasant

The
black
cylinder

of
the
telephone-receiver
seemed
to
hold
a
tiny
animated
image
of
her
:
*NL*
lustrous
eyes
,
delicate
nose
,
gentle
chin

*NL*
*NL*
``
This

know

is
on

the
top
floor

and
with

autumn
rains

roof
is
beginning

The
great
strike
was
over
,
the
strikers
beaten
.
Except
that
Vergil
*NL*
Gunch
seemed
less
cordial
,
there
were
no
visible
effects
of
Babbitt
's
*NL*
treachery
to
the
clan
.
The
oppressive
fear
of
criticism
was
gone
,
but
a
*NL*
diffident
loneliness
remained
.
Now
he
was
so
exhilarated
that
,
to
prove
*NL*
he
was
n't

he
droned
about
the
office
for
fifteen
minutes
,
looking
at
*NL*
blue-prints
,
explaining
to
Miss
McGoun
that
this
Mrs.
Scott
wanted
more
*NL*
money
for
her
house
--
had
raised
the
asking-price
--
raised
it
from
seven
*NL*
thousand
to
eighty-five
hundred
--
would
Miss
McGoun
be
sure
and
put
*NL*
it
down
on
the
card
--
Mrs.
Scott
's
house
--
raise
.
When
he
had
thus
*NL*
established
himself
as
a
person
unemotional
and
interested
only
in
*NL*
business
,
he
sauntered
out
.
He
took
a
particularly
long
time
to
start
*NL*
his
car
;
he
kicked
the
tires
,
dusted
the
glass
of
the
speedometer
,
and
*NL*
tightened
the
screws
holding
the
wind-shield
spot-light
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drove
happily
off
toward
the
Bellevue
district
,
conscious
of
the
*NL*
presence
of
Mrs.
Judique
as
of
a
brilliant
light
on
the
horizon
.
The
*NL*
maple
leaves
had
fallen
and
they
lined
the
gutters
of
the
asphalted
*NL*
streets
.
It
was
a
day
of
pale
gold
and
faded
green
,
tranquil
and
*NL*
lingering
.
Babbitt
was
aware
of
the
meditative
day
,
and
of
the
*NL*
barrenness
of
Bellevue
--
blocks
of
wooden
houses
,
garages
,
little
shops
,
*NL*
weedy
lots
.
``
Needs
pepping
up
;
needs
the
touch
that
people
like
Mrs.
*NL*
Judique
could
give
a
place
,
''
he
ruminated
,
as
he
rattled
through
the
*NL*
long
,
crude
,
airy
streets
.
The
wind
rose
,
enlivening
,
keen
,
and
in
a
*NL*
blaze
of
well-being
he
came
to
the
flat
of
Tanis
Judique
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
wearing
,
when
she
flutteringly
admitted
him
,
a
frock
of
black
*NL*
chiffon
cut
modestly
round
at
the
base
of
her
pretty
throat
.
She
seemed
*NL*
to
him
immensely
sophisticated
.
He
glanced
at
the
cretonnes
and
colored
*NL*
prints
in
her
living-room
,
and
gurgled
,
``
Gosh
,
you
've
fixed
the
place
*NL*
nice
!
Takes
a
clever
woman
to
know
how
to
make
a
home
,
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
like
it
?
I
'm
so
glad
!
But
you
've
neglected
me
,
scandalously
.
*NL*
You
promised
to
come
some
time
and
learn
to
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rather
unsteadily
,
``
Oh
,
but
you
did
n't
mean
it
seriously
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
But
you
might
have
tried
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
I
've
come
for
my
lesson
,
and
you
might
just
as
well
prepare
*NL*
to
have
me
stay
for
supper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
laughed
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
of
course
he
did
n't
*NL*
mean
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
first
I
guess
I
better
look
at
that
leak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
climbed
with
him
to
the
flat
roof
of
the
apartment-house
a
detached
*NL*
world
of
slatted
wooden
walks
,
clotheslines
,
water-tank
in
a
penthouse
.
*NL*
He
poked
at
things
with
his
toe
,
and
sought
to
impress
her
by
being
*NL*
learned
about
copper
gutters
,
the
desirability
of
passing
plumbing
pipes
*NL*
through
a
lead
collar
and
sleeve
and
flashing
them
with
copper
,
and
the
*NL*
advantages
of
cedar
over
boiler-iron
for
roof-tanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
to
know
so
much
,
in
real
estate
!
''
she
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
promised
that
the
roof
should
be
repaired
within
two
days
.
``
Do
you
*NL*
mind
my
`
phoning
from
your
apartment
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
a
moment
at
the
coping
,
looking
over
a
land
of
hard
little
*NL*
bungalows
with
abnormally
large
porches
,
and
new
apartment-houses
,
*NL*
small
,
but
brave
with
variegated
brick
walls
and
terra-cotta
trimmings
.
*NL*
Beyond
them
was
a
hill
with
a
gouge
of
yellow
clay
like
a
vast
wound
.
*NL*
Behind
every
apartment-house
,
beside
each
dwelling
,
were
small
garages
.
*NL*
It
was
a
world
of
good
little
people
,
comfortable
,
industrious
,
*NL*
credulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
autumnal
light
the
flat
newness
was
mellowed
,
and
the
air
was
a
*NL*
sun-tinted
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Golly
,
it
's
one
fine
afternoon
.
You
get
a
great
view
here
,
right
up
*NL*
Tanner
's
Hill
,
''
said
Babbitt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
is
n't
it
nice
and
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
darn
few
people
appreciate
a
View
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
go
raising
my
rent
on
that
account
!
Oh
,
that
was
naughty
*NL*
of
me
!
I
was
just
teasing
.
Seriously
though
,
there
are
so
few
who
*NL*
respond
--
who
react
to
Views
.
I
mean
--
they
have
n't
any
feeling
of
poetry
*NL*
and
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fact
,
they
have
n't
,
''
he
breathed
,
admiring
her
slenderness
and
*NL*
the
absorbed
,
airy
way
in
which
she
looked
toward
the
hill
,
chin
lifted
,
*NL*
lips
smiling
.
``
Well
,
guess
I
'd
better
telephone
the
plumbers
,
so
they
'll
*NL*
get
on
the
job
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
telephoned
,
making
it
conspicuously
authoritative
and
gruff
*NL*
and
masculine
,
he
looked
doubtful
,
and
sighed
,
``
S'pose
I
'd
better
be
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
have
that
cup
of
tea
first
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
would
go
pretty
good
,
at
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
luxurious
to
loll
in
a
deep
green
rep
chair
,
his
legs
thrust
*NL*
out
before
him
,
to
glance
at
the
black
Chinese
telephone
stand
and
the
*NL*
colored
photograph
of
Mount
Vernon
which
he
had
always
liked
so
much
,
*NL*
while
in
the
tiny
kitchen
--
so
near
--
Mrs.
Judique
sang
``
My
Creole
Queen
.
''
*NL*
In
an
intolerable
sweetness
,
a
contentment
so
deep
that
he
was
wistfully
*NL*
discontented
,
he
saw
magnolias
by
moonlight
and
heard
plantation
darkies
*NL*
crooning
to
the
banjo
.
He
wanted
to
be
near
her
,
on
pretense
of
helping
*NL*
her
,
yet
he
wanted
to
remain
in
this
still
ecstasy
.
Languidly
he
*NL*
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
bustled
in
with
the
tea
he
smiled
up
at
her
.
``
This
is
awfully
*NL*
nice
!
''
For
the
first
time
,
he
was
not
fencing
;
he
was
quietly
and
*NL*
securely
friendly
;
and
friendly
and
quiet
was
her
answer
:
``
It
's
nice
to
*NL*
have
you
here
.
You
were
so
kind
,
helping
me
to
find
this
little
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
agreed
that
the
weather
would
soon
turn
cold
.
They
agreed
that
*NL*
prohibition
was
prohibitive
.
They
agreed
that
art
in
the
home
was
*NL*
cultural
.
They
agreed
about
everything
.
They
even
became
bold
.
They
*NL*
hinted
that
these
modern
young
girls
,
well
,
honestly
,
their
short
skirts
*NL*
were
short
.
They
were
proud
to
find
that
they
were
not
shocked
by
such
*NL*
frank
speaking
.
Tanis
ventured
,
``
I
know
you
'll
understand
--
I
mean
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
say
it
,
but
I
do
think
that
girls
who
pretend
*NL*
they
're
bad
by
the
way
they
dress
really
never
go
any
farther
.
They
give
*NL*
away
the
fact
that
they
have
n't
the
instincts
of
a
womanly
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
Ida
Putiak
,
the
manicure
girl
,
and
how
ill
she
had
used
him
,
*NL*
Babbitt
agreed
with
enthusiasm
;
remembering
how
ill
all
the
world
had
*NL*
used
him
,
he
told
of
Paul
Riesling
,
of
Zilla
,
of
Seneca
Doane
,
of
the
*NL*
strike
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
how
it
was
?
Course
I
was
as
anxious
to
have
those
beggars
licked
to
*NL*
a
standstill
as
anybody
else
,
but
gosh
,
no
reason
for
not
seeing
their
*NL*
side
.
For
a
fellow
's
own
sake
,
he
's
got
to
be
broad-minded
and
liberal
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
!
''
Sitting
on
the
hard
little
couch
,
she
clasped
her
hands
*NL*
beside
her
,
leaned
toward
him
,
absorbed
him
;
and
in
a
glorious
state
of
*NL*
being
appreciated
he
proclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
up
and
said
to
the
fellows
at
the
club
,
`
Look
here

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
``
No

but
I
always
say

No

Nothing

I
do
n't
mind
the
*NL*
expense
but
I
ca

all
the
old
fogies

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes

's
so

But
tell
me
:
what
did
you
say
to
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
do
n't

I
'm
probably
boring

troubles

You
would
n't
hardly
think

*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Her
voice
caressed
him
;
it
cloaked
him
like
warm
silk
.
*NL*
``

I
feel
lonely

so
lonely

``
Yes

They
smiled

tell
me
what
you
said

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

it

what
they
want

what

biggest
statesmen

at

a
man
who
*NL*
makes
them
think
,
and
with
your
reputation
for
oratory
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
about
my
reputation
for
oratory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
going
to
tell
you
everything
I
know
!
But
seriously
,
you
*NL*
do
n't
realize
what
a
famous
man
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
Though
I
have
n't
done
much
orating
this
fall
.
Too
kind
of
*NL*
bothered
by
this
Paul
Riesling
business
,
I
guess
.
But
--
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
you
're
the
first
person
that
's
really
understood
what
I
was
getting
at
,
*NL*
Tanis
--
Listen
to
me
,
will
you
!
Fat
nerve
I
've
got
,
calling
you
Tanis
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
!
And
shall
I
call
you
George
?
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
awfully
nice
*NL*
when
two
people
have
so
much
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
--
so
much
analysis
*NL*
that
they
can
discard
all
these
stupid
conventions
and
understand
each
*NL*
other
and
become
acquainted
right
away
,
like
ships
that
pass
in
the
*NL*
night
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
do
!
I
certainly
do

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
quiescent
in
his
chair
;
he
wandered
about
the
room
,
he
*NL*
dropped
on
the
couch
beside
her
.
But
as
he
awkwardly
stretched
his
hand
*NL*
toward
her
fragile
,
immaculate
fingers
,
she
said
brightly
,
``
Do
give
me
*NL*
a
cigarette
.
Would
you
think
poor
Tanis
was
dreadfully
naughty
if
she
*NL*
smoked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
no
!
I
like
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
often
and
weightily
pondered
flappers
smoking
in
Zenith
*NL*
restaurants
,
but
he
knew
only
one
woman
who
smoked
--
Mrs.
Sam
Doppelbrau
,
*NL*
his
flighty
neighbor
.
He
ceremoniously
lighted
Tanis
's
cigarette
,
looked
*NL*
for
a
place
to
deposit
the
burnt
match
,
and
dropped
it
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
want
a
cigar
,
you
poor
man
!
''
she
crooned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
I
love
the
smell
of
a
good
cigar
;
so
nice
and
--
so
nice
and
like
*NL*
a
man
.
You
'll
find
an
ash-tray
in
my
bedroom
,
on
the
table
beside
the
*NL*
bed
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
getting
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
embarrassed
by
her
bedroom
:
the
broad
couch
with
a
cover
of
*NL*
violet
silk
,
mauve
curtains
striped
with
gold
.
Chinese
Chippendale
*NL*
bureau
,
and
an
amazing
row
of
slippers
,
with
ribbon-wound
shoe-trees
,
*NL*
and
primrose
stockings
lying
across
them
.
His
manner
of
bringing
the
*NL*
ash-tray
had
just
the
right
note
of
easy
friendliness
,
he
felt
.
``
A
boob
*NL*
like
Verg
Gunch
would
try
to
get
funny
about
seeing
her
bedroom
,
but
*NL*
I
take
it
casually
.
''
He
was
not
casual
afterward
.
The
contentment
of
*NL*
companionship
was
gone
,
and
he
was
restless
with
desire
to
touch
her
*NL*
hand
.
But
whenever
he
turned
toward
her
,
the
cigarette
was
in
his
way
.
*NL*
It
was
a
shield
between
them
.
He
waited
till
she
should
have
finished
,
*NL*
but
as
he
rejoiced
at
her
quick
crushing
of
its
light
on
the
ashtray
she
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
give
me
another
cigarette
?
''
and
hopelessly
he
*NL*
saw
the
screen
of
pale
smoke
and
her
graceful
tilted
hand
again
between
*NL*
them
.
He
was
not
merely
curious
now
to
find
out
whether
she
would
*NL*
let
him
hold
her
hand
-LRB-
all
in
the
purest
friendship
,
naturally
-RRB-
,
but
*NL*
agonized
with
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
surface
appeared
none
of
all
this
fretful
drama
.
They
were
*NL*
talking
cheerfully
of
motors
,
of
trips
to
California
,
of
Chum
Frink
.
*NL*
Once
he
said
delicately
,
``
I
do
hate
these
guys
--
I
hate
these
people
that
*NL*
invite
themselves
to
meals
,
but
I
seem
to
have
a
feeling
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
have
supper
with
the
lovely
Mrs.
Tanis
Judique
to-night
.
But
I
suppose
*NL*
you
probably
have
seven
dates
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
thinking
some
of
going
to
the
movies
.
Yes
,
I
really
think
I
*NL*
ought
to
get
out
and
get
some
fresh
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
encourage
him
to
stay
,
but
never
did
she
discourage
him
.
*NL*
He
considered
,
``
I
better
take
a
sneak
!
She
WILL
let
me
stay
--
there
IS
*NL*
something
doing
--
and
I
must
n't
get
mixed
up
with
--
I
must
n't
--
I
've
got
to
*NL*
beat
it
.
''
Then
,
``
No
.
it
's
too
late
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
at
seven
,
brushing
her
cigarette
away
,
brusquely
taking
her
*NL*
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tanis
!
Stop
teasing
me
!
You
know
we
--
Here
we
are
,
a
couple
of
lonely
*NL*
birds
,
and
we
're
awful
happy
together
.
Anyway
I
am
!
Never
been
so
*NL*
happy
!
Do
let
me
stay
!
Ill
gallop
down
to
the
delicatessen
and
buy
some
*NL*
stuff
--
cold
chicken
maybe
--
or
cold
turkey
--
and
we
can
have
a
nice
little
*NL*
supper
,
and
afterwards
,
if
you
want
to
chase
me
out
,
I
'll
be
good
and
go
*NL*
like
a
lamb
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
yes
--
it
would
be
nice
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
she
withdraw
her
hand
.
He
squeezed
it
,
trembling
,
and
blundered
*NL*
toward
his
coat
.
At
the
delicatessen
he
bought
preposterous
stores
of
*NL*
food
,
chosen
on
the
principle
of
expensiveness
.
From
the
drug
store
*NL*
across
the
street
he
telephoned
to
his
wife
,
``
Got
to
get
a
fellow
to
*NL*
sign
a
lease
before
he
leaves
town
on
the
midnight
.
Wo
n't
be
home
till
*NL*
late
.
Do
n't
wait
up
for
me
.
Kiss
Tinka
good-night
.
''
He
expectantly
*NL*
lumbered
back
to
the
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
bad
thing
,
to
buy
so
much
food
!
''
was
her
greeting
,
and
her
*NL*
voice
was
gay
,
her
smile
acceptant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
her
in
the
tiny
white
kitchen
;
he
washed
the
lettuce
,
he
*NL*
opened
the
olive
bottle
.
She
ordered
him
to
set
the
table
,
and
as
he
*NL*
trotted
into
the
living-room
,
as
he
hunted
through
the
buffet
for
knives
*NL*
and
forks
,
he
felt
utterly
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
only
other
thing
,
''
he
announced
,
``
is
what
you
're
going
to
wear
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
decide
whether
you
're
to
put
on
your
swellest
evening
gown
,
or
*NL*
let
your
hair
down
and
put
on
short
skirts
and
make-believe
you
're
a
*NL*
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
dine
just
as
I
am
,
in
this
old
chiffon
rag
,
and
if
you
*NL*
ca
n't
stand
poor
Tanis
that
way
,
you
can
go
to
the
club
for
dinner
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
you
!
''
He
patted
her
shoulder
.
``
Child
,
you
're
the
brainiest
and
*NL*
the
loveliest
and
finest
woman
I
've
ever
met
!
Come
now
,
Lady
Wycombe
,
*NL*
if
you
'll
take
the
Duke
of
Zenith
's
arm
,
we
will
proambulate
in
to
the
*NL*
magnolious
feed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
say
the
funniest
,
nicest
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
finished
the
picnic
supper
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
*NL*
window
and
reported
,
``
It
's
turned
awful
chilly
,
and
I
think
it
's
going
*NL*
to
rain
.
You
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
movies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
had
a
fireplace
!
I
wish
it
was
raining
like
all
get-out
*NL*
to-night
,
and
we
were
in
a
funny
little
old-fashioned
cottage
,
and
*NL*
the
trees
thrashing
like
everything
outside
,
and
a
great
big
log
fire
*NL*
and
--
I
'll
tell
you
!
Let
's
draw
this
couch
up
to
the
radiator
,
and
*NL*
stretch
our
feet
out
,
and
pretend
it
's
a
wood-fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
think
that
's
pathetic
!
You
big
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
did
draw
up
to
the
radiator
,
and
propped
their
feet
against
*NL*
it
--
his
clumsy
black
shoes
,
her
patent-leather
slippers
.
In
the
dimness
*NL*
they
talked
of
themselves
;
of
how
lonely
she
was
,
how
bewildered
he
,
and
*NL*
how
wonderful
that
they
had
found
each
other
.
As
they
fell
silent
the
*NL*
room
was
stiller
than
a
country
lane
.
There
was
no
sound
from
the
street
*NL*
save
the
whir
of
motor-tires
,
the
rumble
of
a
distant
freight-train
.
*NL*
Self-contained
was
the
room
,
warm
,
secure
,
insulated
from
the
harassing
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
absorbed
by
a
rapture
in
which
all
fear
and
doubting
were
*NL*
smoothed
away
;
and
when
he
reached
home
,
at
dawn
,
the
rapture
had
*NL*
mellowed
to
contentment
serene
and
full
of
memories
.

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
assurance
of
Tanis
Judique
's
friendship
fortified
Babbitt
's
*NL*
self-approval
.
At
the
Athletic
Club
he
became
experimental
.
Though
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
was
silent
,
the
others
at
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
came
to
*NL*
accept
Babbitt
as
having
,
for
no
visible
reason
,
``
turned
crank
.
''
They
*NL*
argued
windily
with
him
,
and
he
was
cocky
,
and
enjoyed
the
spectacle
*NL*
of
his
interesting
martyrdom
.
He
even
praised
Seneca
Doane
.
Professor
*NL*
Pumphrey
said
that
was
carrying
a
joke
too
far
;
but
Babbitt
argued
,
``
No
!
*NL*
Fact
!
I
tell
you
he
's
got
one
of
the
keenest
intellects
in
the
country
.
*NL*
Why
,
Lord
Wycombe
said
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
who
the
hell
is
Lord
Wycombe
?
What
you
always
lugging
him
in
for
?
*NL*
You
been
touting
him
for
the
last
six
weeks
!
''
protested
Orville
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
ordered
him
from
Sears-Roebuck
.
You
can
get
those
English
*NL*
high-muckamucks
by
mail
for
two
bucks
apiece
,
''
suggested
Sidney
*NL*
Finkelstein
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
now
!
Lord
Wycombe
,
he
's
one
of
the
biggest
intellects
*NL*
in
English
political
life
.
As
I
was
saying
:
Of
course
I
'm
conservative
*NL*
myself
,
but
I
appreciate
a
guy
like
Senny
Doane
because
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
interrupted
harshly
,
``
I
wonder
if
you
are
so
conservative
?
*NL*
I
find
I
can
manage
to
run
my
own
business
without
any
skunks
and
reds
*NL*
like
Doane
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grimness
of
Gunch
's
voice
,
the
hardness
of
his
jaw
,
disconcerted
*NL*
Babbitt
,
but
he
recovered
and
went
on
till
they
looked
bored
,
then
*NL*
irritated
,
then
as
doubtful
as
Gunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
Tanis
always
.
With
a
stir
he
remembered
her
every
aspect
.
*NL*
His
arms
yearned
for
her
.
``
I
've
found
her
!
I
've
dreamed
of
her
all
these
*NL*
years
and
now
I
've
found
her
!
''
he
exulted
.
He
met
her
at
the
movies
*NL*
in
the
morning
;
he
drove
out
to
her
flat
in
the
late
afternoon
or
on
*NL*
evenings
when
he
was
believed
to
be
at
the
Elks
.
He
knew
her
financial
*NL*
affairs
and
advised
her
about
them
,
while
she
lamented
her
feminine
*NL*
ignorance
,
and
praised
his
masterfulness
,
and
proved
to
know
much
more
*NL*
about
bonds
than
he
did
.
They
had
remembrances
,
and
laughter
over
old
*NL*
times
.
Once
they
quarreled
,
and
he
raged
that
she
was
as
``
bossy
''
as
*NL*
his
wife
and
far
more
whining
when
he
was
inattentive
.
But
that
passed
*NL*
safely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
high
hour
was
a
tramp
on
a
ringing
December
afternoon
,
through
*NL*
snow-drifted
meadows
down
to
the
icy
Chaloosa
River
.
She
was
exotic
*NL*
in
an
astrachan
cap
and
a
short
beaver
coat
;
she
slid
on
the
ice
and
*NL*
shouted
,
and
he
panted
after
her
,
rotund
with
laughter
...
Myra
Babbitt
*NL*
never
slid
on
the
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
afraid
that
they
would
be
seen
together
.
In
Zenith
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
lunch
with
a
neighbor
's
wife
without
the
fact
being
*NL*
known
,
before
nightfall
,
in
every
house
in
your
circle
.
But
Tanis
was
*NL*
beautifully
discreet
.
However
appealingly
she
might
turn
to
him
when
*NL*
they
were
alone
,
she
was
gravely
detached
when
they
were
abroad
,
and
he
*NL*
hoped
that
she
would
be
taken
for
a
client
.
Orville
Jones
once
saw
them
*NL*
emerging
from
a
movie
theater
,
and
Babbitt
bumbled
,
``
Let
me
make
you
*NL*
`
quainted
with
Mrs.
Judique
.
Now
here
's
a
lady
who
knows
the
right
*NL*
broker
to
come
to
,
Orvy
!
''
Mr.
Jones
,
though
he
was
a
man
censorious
of
*NL*
morals
and
of
laundry
machinery
,
seemed
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
predominant
fear
--
not
from
any
especial
fondness
for
her
but
from
*NL*
the
habit
of
propriety
--
was
that
his
wife
would
learn
of
the
affair
.
He
*NL*
was
certain
that
she
knew
nothing
specific
about
Tanis
,
but
he
was
also
*NL*
certain
that
she
suspected
something
indefinite
.
For
years
she
had
been
*NL*
bored
by
anything
more
affectionate
than
a
farewell
kiss
,
yet
she
was
*NL*
hurt
by
any
slackening
in
his
irritable
periodic
interest
,
and
now
he
*NL*
had
no
interest
;
rather
,
a
revulsion
.
He
was
completely
faithful
--
to
*NL*
Tanis
.
He
was
distressed
by
the
sight
of
his
wife
's
slack
plumpness
,
by
*NL*
her
puffs
and
billows
of
flesh
,
by
the
tattered
petticoat
which
she
was
*NL*
always
meaning
and
always
forgetting
to
throw
away
.
But
he
was
aware
*NL*
that
she
,
so
long
attuned
to
him
,
caught
all
his
repulsions
.
He
*NL*
elaborately
,
heavily
,
jocularly
tried
to
check
them
.
He
could
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
tolerable
Christmas
.
Kenneth
Escott
was
there
,
admittedly
*NL*
engaged
to
Verona
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
tearful
and
called
Kenneth
her
new
*NL*
son
.
Babbitt
was
worried
about
Ted
,
because
he
had
ceased
complaining
*NL*
of
the
State
University
and
become
suspiciously
acquiescent
.
He
wondered
*NL*
what
the
boy
was
planning
,
and
was
too
shy
to
ask
.
Himself
,
Babbitt
*NL*
slipped
away
on
Christmas
afternoon
to
take
his
present
,
a
silver
*NL*
cigarette-box
,
to
Tanis
.
When
he
returned
Mrs.
Babbitt
asked
,
much
too
*NL*
innocently
,
``
Did
you
go
out
for
a
little
fresh
air
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
just
lil
drive
,
''
he
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
New
Year
's
his
wife
proposed
,
``
I
heard
from
my
sister
to-day
,
*NL*
George
.
She
is
n't
well
.
I
think
perhaps
I
ought
to
go
stay
with
her
for
*NL*
a
few
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
was
not
accustomed
to
leave
home
during
the
winter
*NL*
except
on
violently
demanding
occasions
,
and
only
the
summer
before
,
she
*NL*
had
been
gone
for
weeks
.
Nor
was
Babbitt
one
of
the
detachable
husbands
*NL*
who
take
separations
casually
He
liked
to
have
her
there
;
she
looked
*NL*
after
his
clothes
;
she
knew
how
his
steak
ought
to
be
cooked
;
and
her
*NL*
clucking
made
him
feel
secure
.
But
he
could
not
drum
up
even
a
dutiful
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
does
n't
really
need
you
,
does
she
?
''
While
he
tried
to
look
*NL*
regretful
,
while
he
felt
that
his
wife
was
watching
him
,
he
was
filled
*NL*
with
exultant
visions
of
Tanis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
'd
better
go
?
''
she
said
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
to
decide
,
honey
;
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
,
sighing
,
and
his
forehead
was
damp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
she
went
,
four
days
later
,
she
was
curiously
still
,
he
cumbrously
*NL*
affectionate
.
Her
train
left
at
noon
.
As
he
saw
it
grow
small
beyond
the
*NL*
train-shed
he
longed
to
hurry
to
Tanis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
golly
,
I
wo
n't
do
that
!
''
he
vowed
.
``
I
wo
n't
go
near
her
for
a
*NL*
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
at
her
flat
at
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
had
once
controlled
or
seemed
to
control
his
life
in
a
progress
*NL*
unimpassioned
but
diligent
and
sane
was
for
that
fortnight
borne
on
a
*NL*
current
of
desire
and
very
bad
whisky
and
all
the
complications
of
*NL*
new
acquaintances
,
those
furious
new
intimates
who
demand
so
much
more
*NL*
attention
than
old
friends
.
Each
morning
he
gloomily
recognized
his
*NL*
idiocies
of
the
evening
before
.
With
his
head
throbbing
,
his
tongue
and
*NL*
lips
stinging
from
cigarettes
,
he
incredulously
counted
the
number
of
*NL*
drinks
he
had
taken
,
and
groaned
,
``
I
got
to
quit
!
''
He
had
ceased
saying
,
*NL*
``
I
WILL
quit
!
''
for
however
resolute
he
might
be
at
dawn
,
he
could
not
,
*NL*
for
a
single
evening
,
check
his
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
met
Tanis
's
friends
;
he
had
,
with
the
ardent
haste
of
the
*NL*
Midnight
People
,
who
drink
and
dance
and
rattle
and
are
ever
afraid
to
*NL*
be
silent
,
been
adopted
as
a
member
of
her
group
,
which
they
called
``
The
*NL*
Bunch
.
''
He
first
met
them
after
a
day
when
he
had
worked
particularly
*NL*
hard
and
when
he
hoped
to
be
quiet
with
Tanis
and
slowly
sip
her
*NL*
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
down
the
hall
he
could
hear
shrieks
and
the
grind
of
a
phonograph
.
*NL*
As
Tanis
opened
the
door
he
saw
fantastic
figures
dancing
in
a
haze
of
*NL*
cigarette
smoke
.
The
tables
and
chairs
were
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
n't
this
dandy
!
''
she
gabbled
at
him
.
``
Carrie
Nork
had
the
*NL*
loveliest
idea
.
She
decided
it
was
time
for
a
party
,
and
she
`
phoned
the
*NL*
Bunch
and
told
'em
to
gather
round
...
George
,
this
is
Carrie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
''
was
,
in
the
less
desirable
aspects
of
both
,
at
once
matronly
*NL*
and
spinsterish
.
She
was
perhaps
forty
;
her
hair
was
an
unconvincing
*NL*
ash-blond
;
and
if
her
chest
was
flat
,
her
hips
were
ponderous
.
She
*NL*
greeted
Babbitt
with
a
giggling
``
Welcome
to
our
little
midst
!
Tanis
says
*NL*
you
're
a
real
sport
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
apparently
expected
to
dance
,
to
be
boyish
and
gay
with
Carrie
,
*NL*
and
he
did
his
unforgiving
best
.
He
towed
her
about
the
room
,
bumping
*NL*
into
other
couples
,
into
the
radiator
,
into
chair-legs
cunningly
*NL*
ambushed
.
As
he
danced
he
surveyed
the
rest
of
the
Bunch
:
A
thin
young
*NL*
woman
who
looked
capable
,
conceited
,
and
sarcastic
.
Another
woman
whom
*NL*
he
could
never
quite
remember
.
Three
overdressed
and
slightly
effeminate
*NL*
young
men
--
soda-fountain
clerks
,
or
at
least
born
for
that
profession
.
*NL*
A
man
of
his
own
age
,
immovable
,
self-satisfied
,
resentful
of
Babbitt
's
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
his
dutiful
dance
Tanis
took
him
aside
and
begged
,
*NL*
``
Dear
,
would
n't
you
like
to
do
something
for
me
?
I
'm
all
out
of
booze
,
*NL*
and
the
Bunch
want
to
celebrate
.
Could
n't
you
just
skip
down
to
Healey
*NL*
Hanson
's
and
get
some
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
he
said
,
trying
not
to
sound
sullen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
:
I
'll
get
Minnie
Sonntag
to
drive
down
with
you
.
''
Tanis
*NL*
was
pointing
to
the
thin
,
sarcastic
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Sonntag
greeted
him
with
an
astringent
``
How
d'you
do
,
Mr.
Babbitt
.
*NL*
Tanis
tells
me
you
're
a
very
prominent
man
,
and
I
'm
honored
by
being
*NL*
allowed
to
drive
with
you
.
Of
course
I
'm
not
accustomed
to
associating
*NL*
with
society
people
like
you
,
so
I
do
n't
know
how
to
act
in
such
exalted
*NL*
circles
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Miss
Sonntag
talked
all
the
way
down
to
Healey
Hanson
's
.
To
her
*NL*
jibes
he
wanted
to
reply
``
Oh
,
go
to
the
devil
!
''
but
he
never
quite
*NL*
nerved
himself
to
that
reasonable
comment
.
He
was
resenting
the
*NL*
existence
of
the
whole
Bunch
.
He
had
heard
Tanis
speak
of
``
darling
*NL*
Carrie
''
and
``
Min
Sonntag
--
she
's
so
clever
--
you
'll
adore
her
,
''
but
*NL*
they
had
never
been
real
to
him
.
He
had
pictured
Tanis
as
living
in
a
*NL*
rose-tinted
vacuum
,
waiting
for
him
,
free
of
all
the
complications
of
a
*NL*
Floral
Heights
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
returned
he
had
to
endure
the
patronage
of
the
young
*NL*
soda-clerks
.
They
were
as
damply
friendly
as
Miss
Sonntag
was
dryly
*NL*
hostile
.
They
called
him
``
Old
Georgie
''
and
shouted
,
``
Come
on
now
,
sport
;
*NL*
shake
a
leg
''
...
boys
in
belted
coats
,
pimply
boys
,
as
young
as
Ted
*NL*
and
as
flabby
as
chorus-men
,
but
powerful
to
dance
and
to
mind
the
*NL*
phonograph
and
smoke
cigarettes
and
patronize
Tanis
.
He
tried
to
be
one
*NL*
of
them
;
he
cried
``
Good
work
,
Pete
!
''
but
his
voice
creaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tanis
apparently
enjoyed
the
companionship
of
the
dancing
darlings
;
she
*NL*
bridled
to
their
bland
flirtation
and
casually
kissed
them
at
the
end
*NL*
of
each
dance
.
Babbitt
hated
her
,
for
the
moment
.
He
saw
her
as
*NL*
middle-aged
.
He
studied
the
wrinkles
in
the
softness
of
her
throat
,
the
*NL*
slack
flesh
beneath
her
chin
.
The
taut
muscles
of
her
youth
were
loose
*NL*
and
drooping
.
Between
dances
she
sat
in
the
largest
chair
,
waving
her
*NL*
cigarette
,
summoning
her
callow
admirers
to
come
and
talk
to
her
.
-LRB-
``
She
*NL*
thinks
she
's
a
blooming
queen
!
''
growled
Babbitt
.
-RRB-
She
chanted
to
Miss
*NL*
Sonntag
,
``
Is
n't
my
little
studio
sweet
?
''
-LRB-
``
Studio
,
rats
!
It
's
a
plain
*NL*
old-maid-and-chow-dog
flat
!
Oh
,
God
,
I
wish
I
was
home
!
I
wonder
if
I
*NL*
ca
n't
make
a
getaway
now
?
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
His
vision
grew
blurred
,
however
,
as
he
applied
himself
to
Healey
*NL*
Hanson
's
raw
but
vigorous
whisky
.
He
blended
with
the
Bunch
.
He
began
*NL*
to
rejoice
that
Carrie
Nork
and
Pete
,
the
most
nearly
intelligent
of
the
*NL*
nimble
youths
,
seemed
to
like
him
;
and
it
was
enormously
important
to
*NL*
win
over
the
surly
older
man
,
who
proved
to
be
a
railway
clerk
named
*NL*
Fulton
Bemis
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
of
the
Bunch
was
exclamatory
,
high-colored
,
full
of
*NL*
references
to
people
whom
Babbitt
did
not
know
.
Apparently
they
thought
*NL*
very
comfortably
of
themselves
.
They
were
the
Bunch
,
wise
and
beautiful
*NL*
and
amusing
;
they
were
Bohemians
and
urbanites
,
accustomed
to
all
the
*NL*
luxuries
of
Zenith
:
dance-halls
,
movie-theaters
,
and
roadhouses
;
and
*NL*
in
a
cynical
superiority
to
people
who
were
``
slow
''
or
``
tightwad
''
they
*NL*
cackled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Pete
,
did
I
tell
you
what
that
dub
of
a
cashier
said
when
I
came
in
*NL*
late
yesterday
?
Oh
,
it
was
per-fect-ly
priceless
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
was
n't
T.
D.
stewed
!
Say
,
he
was
simply
ossified
!
What
did
*NL*
Gladys
say
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
the
nerve
of
Bob
Bickerstaff
trying
to
get
us
to
come
to
his
*NL*
house
!
Say
,
the
nerve
of
him
!
Can
you
beat
it
for
nerve
?
Some
nerve
I
*NL*
call
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
how
Dotty
was
dancing
?
Gee
,
was
n't
she
the
limit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
to
be
heard
sonorously
agreeing
with
the
once-hated
Miss
*NL*
Minnie
Sonntag
that
persons
who
let
a
night
go
by
without
dancing
to
*NL*
jazz
music
were
crabs
,
pikers
,
and
poor
fish
;
and
he
roared
``
You
bet
!
''
*NL*
when
Mrs.
Carrie
Nork
gurgled
,
``
Do
n't
you
love
to
sit
on
the
floor
?
It
's
*NL*
so
Bohemian
!
''
He
began
to
think
extremely
well
of
the
Bunch
.
When
he
*NL*
mentioned
his
friends
Sir
Gerald
Doak
,
Lord
Wycombe
,
William
Washington
*NL*
Eathorne
,
and
Chum
Frink
,
he
was
proud
of
their
condescending
interest
.
*NL*
He
got
so
thoroughly
into
the
jocund
spirit
that
he
did
n't
much
mind
*NL*
seeing
Tanis
drooping
against
the
shoulder
of
the
youngest
and
milkiest
*NL*
of
the
young
men
,
and
he
himself
desired
to
hold
Carrie
Nork
's
pulpy
*NL*
hand
,
and
dropped
it
only
because
Tanis
looked
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
home
,
at
two
,
he
was
fully
a
member
of
the
Bunch
,
and
*NL*
all
the
week
thereafter
he
was
bound
by
the
exceedingly
straitened
*NL*
conventions
,
the
exceedingly
wearing
demands
,
of
their
life
of
pleasure
*NL*
and
freedom
.
He
had
to
go
to
their
parties
;
he
was
involved
in
the
*NL*
agitation
when
everybody
telephoned
to
everybody
else
that
she
had
n't
*NL*
meant
what
she
'd
said
when
she
'd
said
that
,
and
anyway
,
why
was
Pete
*NL*
going
around
saying
she
'd
said
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Never
was
a
Family
more
insistent
on
learning
one
another
's
movements
*NL*
than
were
the
Bunch
.
All
of
them
volubly
knew
,
or
indignantly
desired
*NL*
to
know
,
where
all
the
others
had
been
every
minute
of
the
week
.
Babbitt
*NL*
found
himself
explaining
to
Carrie
or
Fulton
Bemis
just
what
he
had
*NL*
been
doing
that
he
should
not
have
joined
them
till
ten
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
apologizing
for
having
gone
to
dinner
with
a
business
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
member
of
the
Bunch
was
expected
to
telephone
to
every
other
*NL*
member
at
least
once
a
week
.
``
Why
have
n't
you
called
me
up
?
''
Babbitt
*NL*
was
asked
accusingly
,
not
only
by
Tanis
and
Carrie
but
presently
by
new
*NL*
ancient
friends
,
Jennie
and
Capitolina
and
Toots
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
for
a
moment
he
had
seen
Tanis
as
withering
and
sentimental
,
he
lost
*NL*
that
impression
at
Carrie
Nork
's
dance
.
Mrs.
Nork
had
a
large
house
and
*NL*
a
small
husband
.
To
her
party
came
all
of
the
Bunch
,
perhaps
thirty-five
*NL*
of
them
when
they
were
completely
mobilized
.
Babbitt
,
under
the
name
*NL*
of
``
Old
Georgie
,
''
was
now
a
pioneer
of
the
Bunch
,
since
each
month
it
*NL*
changed
half
its
membership
and
he
who
could
recall
the
prehistoric
days
*NL*
of
a
fortnight
ago
,
before
Mrs.
Absolom
,
the
food-demonstrator
,
had
*NL*
gone
to
Indianapolis
,
and
Mac
had
``
got
sore
at
''
Minnie
,
was
a
venerable
*NL*
leader
and
able
to
condescend
to
new
Petes
and
Minnies
and
Gladyses
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Carrie
's
,
Tanis
did
not
have
to
work
at
being
hostess
.
She
was
*NL*
dignified
and
sure
,
a
clear
fine
figure
in
the
black
chiffon
frock
he
*NL*
had
always
loved
;
and
in
the
wider
spaces
of
that
ugly
house
Babbitt
was
*NL*
able
to
sit
quietly
with
her
.
He
repented
of
his
first
revulsion
,
mooned
*NL*
at
her
feet
,
and
happily
drove
her
home
.
Next
day
he
bought
a
violent
*NL*
yellow
tie
,
to
make
himself
young
for
her
.
He
knew
,
a
little
sadly
,
that
*NL*
he
could
not
make
himself
beautiful
;
he
beheld
himself
as
heavy
,
hinting
*NL*
of
fatness
,
but
he
danced
,
he
dressed
,
he
chattered
,
to
be
as
young
as
*NL*
she
was
...
as
young
as
she
seemed
to
be
.

IV
*NL*
*NL*
As
all
converts
,
whether
to
a
religion
,
love
,
or
gardening
,
find
as
by
*NL*
magic
that
though
hitherto
these
hobbies
have
not
seemed
to
exist
,
now
*NL*
the
whole
world
is
filled
with
their
fury
,
so
,
once
he
was
converted
*NL*
to
dissipation
,
Babbitt
discovered
agreeable
opportunities
for
it
*NL*
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
new
view
of
his
sporting
neighbor
,
Sam
Doppelbrau
.
The
*NL*
Doppelbraus
were
respectable
people
,
industrious
people
,
prosperous
*NL*
people
,
whose
ideal
of
happiness
was
an
eternal
cabaret
.
Their
life
was
*NL*
dominated
by
suburban
bacchanalia
of
alcohol
,
nicotine
,
gasoline
,
and
*NL*
kisses
.
They
and
their
set
worked
capably
all
the
week
,
and
all
week
*NL*
looked
forward
to
Saturday
night
,
when
they
would
,
as
they
expressed
*NL*
it
,
``
throw
a
party
;
''
and
the
thrown
party
grew
noisier
and
noisier
up
to
*NL*
Sunday
dawn
,
and
usually
included
an
extremely
rapid
motor
expedition
to
*NL*
nowhere
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
Tanis
was
at
the
theater
,
Babbitt
found
himself
being
*NL*
lively
with
the
Doppelbraus
,
pledging
friendship
with
men
whom
he
*NL*
had
for
years
privily
denounced
to
Mrs.
Babbitt
as
a
``
rotten
bunch
of
*NL*
tin-horns
that
I
would
n't
go
out
with
,
rot
if
they
were
the
last
people
*NL*
on
earth
.
''
That
evening
he
had
sulkily
come
home
and
poked
about
in
*NL*
front
of
the
house
,
chipping
off
the
walk
the
ice-clots
,
like
fossil
*NL*
footprints
,
made
by
the
steps
of
passers-by
during
the
recent
snow
.
*NL*
Howard
Littlefield
came
up
snuffling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
a
widower
,
George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump
.
Cold
again
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
hear
from
the
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
feeling
fine
,
but
her
sister
is
still
pretty
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
better
come
in
and
have
dinner
with
us
to-night
,
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
oh
,
thanks
.
Have
to
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
could
not
endure
Littlefield
's
recitals
of
the
more
*NL*
interesting
statistics
about
totally
uninteresting
problems
.
He
scraped
*NL*
at
the
walk
and
grunted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
Doppelbrau
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evenin
'
,
Babbitt
.
Working
hard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yuh
,
lil
exercise

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cold
enough
for
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
just
about

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh-huh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Babbitt
,
while
she
's
away
--
I
know
you
do
n't
care
much
for

booze-fights
,
but
the
Missus
and
I
'd
be
awfully
glad
if
you
could
come
*NL*
in
some
night
.
Think
you
could
stand
a
good
cocktail
for
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
it
?
Young
fella
,
I
bet
old
Uncle
George
can
mix
the
best
cocktail
*NL*
in
these
United
States
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurray
!
That
's
the
way
to
talk
!
Look
here
:
There
's
some
folks
coming
*NL*
to
the
house
to-night
,
Louetta
Swanson
and
some
other
live
ones
,
and
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
open
up
a
bottle
of
pre-war
gin
,
and
maybe
we
'll
dance
a
while
.
*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
drop
in
and
jazz
it
up
a
little
,
just
for
a
change
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
What
time
they
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
at
Sam
Doppelbrau
's
at
nine
.
It
was
the
third
time
he
had
entered
*NL*
the
house
.
By
ten
he
was
calling
Mr.
Doppelbrau
``
Sam
,
old
hoss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
they
all
drove
out
to
the
Old
Farm
Inn
.
Babbitt
sat
in
the
*NL*
back
of
Doppelbrau
's
car
with
Louetta
Swanson
.
Once
he
had
timorously
*NL*
tried
to
make
love
to
her
.
Now
he
did
not
try
;
he
merely
made
love
;
and
*NL*
Louetta
dropped
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
told
him
what
a
nagger
Eddie
*NL*
was
,
and
accepted
Babbitt
as
a
decent
and
well-trained
libertine
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
assistance
of
Tanis
's
Bunch
,
the
Doppelbraus
,
and
other
*NL*
companions
in
forgetfulness
,
there
was
not
an
evening
for
two
weeks
when
*NL*
he
did
not
return
home
late
and
shaky
.
With
his
other
faculties
blurred
*NL*
he
yet
had
the
motorist
's
gift
of
being
able
to
drive
when
he
could
*NL*
scarce
walk
;
of
slowing
down
at
corners
and
allowing
for
approaching
*NL*
cars
.
He
came
wambling
into
the
house
.
If
Verona
and
Kenneth
Escott
were
*NL*
about
,
he
got
past
them
with
a
hasty
greeting
,
horribly
aware
of
their
*NL*
level
young
glances
,
and
hid
himself
up-stairs
.
He
found
when
he
came
*NL*
into
the
warm
house
that
he
was
hazier
than
he
had
believed
.
His
head
*NL*
whirled
.
He
dared
not
lie
down
.
He
tried
to
soak
out
the
alcohol
in
a
*NL*
hot
bath
.
For
the
moment
his
head
was
clearer
but
when
he
moved
about
*NL*
the
bathroom
his
calculations
of
distance
were
wrong
,
so
that
he
dragged
*NL*
down
the
towels
,
and
knocked
over
the
soap-dish
with
a
clatter
which
,
he
*NL*
feared
,
would
betray
him
to
the
children
.
Chilly
in
his
dressing-gown
he
*NL*
tried
to
read
the
evening
paper
.
He
could
follow
every
word
;
he
seemed
*NL*
to
take
in
the
sense
of
things
;
but
a
minute
afterward
he
could
not
have
*NL*
told
what
he
had
been
reading
.
When
he
went
to
bed
his
brain
flew
in
*NL*
circles
,
and
he
hastily
sat
up
,
struggling
for
self-control
.
At
last
*NL*
he
was
able
to
lie
still
,
feeling
only
a
little
sick
and
dizzy
--
and
*NL*
enormously
ashamed
.
To
hide
his
``
condition
''
from
his
own
children
!
*NL*
To
have
danced
and
shouted
with
people
whom
he
despised
!
To
have
*NL*
said
foolish
things
,
sung
idiotic
songs
,
tried
to
kiss
silly
girls
!
*NL*
Incredulously
he
remembered
that
he
had
by
his
roaring
familiarity
with
*NL*
them
laid
himself
open
to
the
patronizing
of
youths
whom
he
would
have
*NL*
kicked
out
of
his
office
;
that
by
dancing
too
ardently
he
had
exposed
*NL*
himself
to
rebukes
from
the
rattiest
of
withering
women
.
As
it
came
*NL*
relentlessly
back
to
him
he
snarled
,
``
I
hate
myself
!
God
how
I
hate
*NL*
myself
!
''
But
,
he
raged
,
``
I
'm
through
!
No
more
!
Had
enough
,
plenty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
even
surer
about
it
the
morning
after
,
when
he
was
trying
to
be
*NL*
grave
and
paternal
with
his
daughters
at
breakfast
.
At
noontime
he
was
*NL*
less
sure
.
He
did
not
deny
that
he
had
been
a
fool
;
he
saw
it
almost
*NL*
as
clearly
as
at
midnight
;
but
anything
,
he
struggled
,
was
better
than
*NL*
going
back
to
a
life
of
barren
heartiness
.
At
four
he
wanted
a
drink
.
He
*NL*
kept
a
whisky
flask
in
his
desk
now
,
and
after
two
minutes
of
battle
he
*NL*
had
his
drink
.
Three
drinks
later
he
began
to
see
the
Bunch
as
tender
*NL*
and
amusing
friends
,
and
by
six
he
was
with
them
...
and
the
tale
was
*NL*
to
be
told
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
morning
his
head
ached
a
little
less
.
A
bad
head
for
drinks
had
*NL*
been
his
safeguard
,
but
the
safeguard
was
crumbling
.
Presently
he
*NL*
could
be
drunk
at
dawn
,
yet
not
feel
particularly
wretched
in
his
*NL*
conscience
--
or
in
his
stomach
--
when
he
awoke
at
eight
.
No
regret
,
no
*NL*
desire
to
escape
the
toil
of
keeping
up
with
the
arduous
merriment
of
*NL*
the
Bunch
,
was
so
great
as
his
feeling
of
social
inferiority
when
he
*NL*
failed
to
keep
up
.
To
be
the
``
livest
''
of
them
was
as
much
his
ambition
*NL*
now
as
it
had
been
to
excel
at
making
money
,
at
playing
golf
,
at
*NL*
motor-driving
,
at
oratory
,
at
climbing
to
the
McKelvey
set
.
But
*NL*
occasionally
he
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
that
Pete
and
the
other
young
men
considered
the
Bunch
too
*NL*
austerely
polite
and
the
Carrie
who
merely
kissed
behind
doors
too
*NL*
embarrassingly
monogamic
.
As
Babbitt
sneaked
from
Floral
Heights
down
*NL*
to
the
Bunch
,
so
the
young
gallants
sneaked
from
the
proprieties
of
the
*NL*
Bunch
off
to
``
times
''
with
bouncing
young
women
whom
they
picked
up
*NL*
in
department
stores
and
at
hotel
coatrooms
.
Once
Babbitt
tried
to
*NL*
accompany
them
.
There
was
a
motor
car
,
a
bottle
of
whisky
,
and
for
him
*NL*
a
grubby
shrieking
cash-girl
from
Parcher
and
Stein
's
.
He
sat
beside
her
*NL*
and
worried
.
He
was
apparently
expected
to
``
jolly
her
along
,
''
but
when
*NL*
she
sang
out
,
``
Hey
,
leggo
,
quit
crushing
me
cootie-garage
,
''
he
did
not
*NL*
quite
know
how
to
go
on
.
They
sat
in
the
back
room
of
a
saloon
,
and
*NL*
Babbitt
had
a
headache
,
was
confused
by
their
new
slang
looked
at
them
*NL*
benevolently
,
wanted
to
go
home
,
and
had
a
drink
--
a
good
many
drinks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
evenings
after
,
Fulton
Bemis
,
the
surly
older
man
of
the
Bunch
,
took
*NL*
Babbitt
aside
and
grunted
,
``
Look
here
,
it
's
none
of
my
business
,
and
God
*NL*
knows
I
always
lap
up
my
share
of
the
hootch
,
but
do
n't
you
think
you
*NL*
better
watch
yourself
?
You
're
one
of
these
enthusiastic
chumps
that
*NL*
always
overdo
things
.
D'
you
realize
you
're
throwing
in
the
booze
as
*NL*
fast
as
you
can
,
and
you
eat
one
cigarette
right
after
another
?
Better
*NL*
cut
it
out
for
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
tearfully
said
that
good
old
Fult
was
a
prince
,
and
yes
,
he
*NL*
certainly
would
cut
it
out
,
and
thereafter
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
*NL*
took
a
drink
and
had
a
terrific
quarrel
with
Tanis
when
she
caught
him
*NL*
being
affectionate
with
Carrie
Nork
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
he
hated
himself
that
he
should
have
sunk
into
a
position
*NL*
where
a
fifteenth-rater
like
Fulton
Bemis
could
rebuke
him
.
He
perceived
*NL*
that
,
since
he
was
making
love
to
every
woman
possible
,
Tanis
was
no
*NL*
longer
his
one
pure
star
,
and
he
wondered
whether
she
had
ever
been
*NL*
anything
more
to
him
than
A
Woman
.
And
if
Bemis
had
spoken
to
him
,
were
*NL*
other
people
talking
about
him
?
He
suspiciously
watched
the
men
at
the
*NL*
Athletic
Club
that
noon
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
they
were
uneasy
.
They
*NL*
had
been
talking
about
him
then
?
He
was
angry
.
He
became
belligerent
.
*NL*
He
not
only
defended
Seneca
Doane
but
even
made
fun
of
the
Y.
M.
C.
A
,
*NL*
Vergil
Gunch
was
rather
brief
in
his
answers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterward
Babbitt
was
not
angry
.
He
was
afraid
.
He
did
not
go
to
the
*NL*
next
lunch
of
the
Boosters
'
Club
but
hid
in
a
cheap
restaurant
,
and
,
*NL*
while
he
munched
a
ham-and-egg
sandwich
and
sipped
coffee
from
a
cup
on
*NL*
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
he
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
days
later
,
when
the
Bunch
were
having
one
of
their
best
parties
,
*NL*
Babbitt
drove
them
to
the
skating-rink
which
had
been
laid
out
on
the
*NL*
Chaloosa
River
.
After
a
thaw
the
streets
had
frozen
in
smooth
ice
.
Down
*NL*
those
wide
endless
streets
the
wind
rattled
between
the
rows
of
wooden
*NL*
houses
,
and
the
whole
Bellevue
district
seemed
a
frontier
town
.
Even
*NL*
with
skid
chains
on
all
four
wheels
,
Babbitt
was
afraid
of
sliding
,
and
*NL*
when
he
came
to
the
long
slide
of
a
hill
he
crawled
down
,
both
brakes
*NL*
on
.
Slewing
round
a
corner
came
a
less
cautious
car
.
It
skidded
,
it
*NL*
almost
raked
them
with
its
rear
fenders
.
In
relief
at
their
escape
the
*NL*
Bunch
--
Tanis
,
Minnie
Sonntag
,
Pete
,
Fulton
Bemis
--
shouted
``
Oh
,
baby
,
''
*NL*
and
waved
their
hands
to
the
agitated
other
driver
.
Then
Babbitt
saw
*NL*
Professor
Pumphrey
laboriously
crawling
up
hill
,
afoot
,
Staring
owlishly
*NL*
at
the
revelers
.
He
was
sure
that
Pumphrey
recognized
him
and
saw
Tanis
*NL*
kiss
him
as
she
crowed
,
``
You
're
such
a
good
driver
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
lunch
next
day
he
probed
Pumphrey
with
``
Out
last
night
with
my
*NL*
brother
and
some
friends
of
his
.
Gosh
,
what
driving
!
Slippery
's
glass
.
*NL*
Thought
I
saw
you
hiking
up
the
Bellevue
Avenue
Hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
n't
--
I
did
n't
see
you
,
''
said
Pumphrey
,
hastily
,
rather
*NL*
guiltily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
two
days
afterward
Babbitt
took
Tanis
to
lunch
at
the
Hotel
*NL*
Thornleigh
.
She
who
had
seemed
well
content
to
wait
for
him
at
her
flat
*NL*
had
begun
to
hint
with
melancholy
smiles
that
he
must
think
but
little
*NL*
of
her
if
he
never
introduced
her
to
his
friends
,
if
he
was
unwilling
to
*NL*
be
seen
with
her
except
at
the
movies
.
He
thought
of
taking
her
to
the
*NL*
``
ladies
'
annex
''
of
the
Athletic
Club
,
but
that
was
too
dangerous
.
He
*NL*
would
have
to
introduce
her
and
,
oh
,
people
might
misunderstand
and
--
He
*NL*
compromised
on
the
Thornleigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unusually
smart
,
all
in
black
:
small
black
tricorne
hat
,
short
*NL*
black
caracul
coat
,
loose
and
swinging
,
and
austere
high-necked
black
*NL*
velvet
frock
at
a
time
when
most
street
costumes
were
like
evening
*NL*
gowns
.
Perhaps
she
was
too
smart
.
Every
one
in
the
gold
and
oak
*NL*
restaurant
of
the
Thornleigh
was
staring
at
her
as
Babbitt
followed
her
*NL*
to
a
table
.
He
uneasily
hoped
that
the
head-waiter
would
give
them
a
*NL*
discreet
place
behind
a
pillar
,
but
they
were
stationed
on
the
center
*NL*
aisle
.
Tanis
seemed
not
to
notice
her
admirers
;
she
smiled
at
Babbitt
*NL*
with
a
lavish
``
Oh
,
is
n't
this
nice
!
What
a
peppy-looking
orchestra
!
''
*NL*
Babbitt
had
difficulty
in
being
lavish
in
return
,
for
two
tables
away
he
*NL*
saw
Vergil
Gunch
.
All
through
the
meal
Gunch
watched
them
,
while
Babbitt
*NL*
watched
himself
being
watched
and
lugubriously
tried
to
keep
from
*NL*
spoiling
Tanis
's
gaiety
.
``
I
felt
like
a
spree
to-day
,
''
she
rippled
.
``
I
*NL*
love
the
Thornleigh
,
do
n't
you
?
It
's
so
live
and
yet
so
--
so
refined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
talk
about
the
Thornleigh
,
the
service
,
the
food
,
the
people
he
*NL*
recognized
in
the
restaurant
,
all
but
Vergil
Gunch
.
There
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
be
anything
else
to
talk
of
.
He
smiled
conscientiously
at
her
*NL*
fluttering
jests
;
he
agreed
with
her
that
Minnie
Sonntag
was
``
so
hard
to
*NL*
get
along
with
,
''
and
young
Pete
``
such
a
silly
lazy
kid
,
really
just
no
*NL*
good
at
all
.
''
But
he
himself
had
nothing
to
say
.
He
considered
telling
*NL*
her
his
worries
about
Gunch
,
but
--
``
oh
,
gosh
,
it
was
too
much
work
to
go
*NL*
into
the
whole
thing
and
explain
about
Verg
and
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
relieved
when
he
put
Tanis
on
a
trolley
;
he
was
cheerful
in
the
*NL*
familiar
simplicities
of
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
Vergil
Gunch
called
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
agitated
,
but
Gunch
began
in
a
friendly
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
boy
?
Say
,
some
of
us
are
getting
up
a
scheme
we
'd
kind
of
*NL*
like
to
have
you
come
in
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
,
Verg
.
Shoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
during
the
war
we
had
the
Undesirable
Element
,
the
Reds
and
*NL*
walking
delegates
and
just
the
plain
common
grouches
,
dead
to
rights
,
*NL*
and
so
did
we
for
quite
a
while
after
the
war
,
but
folks
forget
about
*NL*
the
danger
and
that
gives
these
cranks
a
chance
to
begin
working
*NL*
underground
again
,
especially
a
lot
of
these
parlor
socialists
.
Well
,
*NL*
it
's
up
to
the
folks
that
do
a
little
sound
thinking
to
make
a
conscious
*NL*
effort
to
keep
bucking
these
fellows
.
Some
guy
back
East
has
organized
*NL*
a
society
called
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
for
just
that
purpose
.
Of
*NL*
course
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
and
the
American
Legion
and
so
on
do
*NL*
a
fine
work
in
keeping
the
decent
people
in
the
saddle
,
but
they
're
*NL*
devoted
to
so
many
other
causes
that
they
ca
n't
attend
to
this
one
*NL*
problem
properly
.
But
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
,
the
G.
C.
L.
,
they
*NL*
stick
right
to
it
.
Oh
,
the
G.
C.
L.
has
to
have
some
other
ostensible
*NL*
purposes
--
frinstance
here
in
Zenith
I
think
it
ought
to
support
the
*NL*
park-extension
project
and
the
City
Planning
Committee
--
and
then
,
too
,
*NL*
it
should
have
a
social
aspect
,
being
made
up
of
the
best
people
--
have
*NL*
dances
and
so
on
,
especially
as
one
of
the
best
ways
it
can
put
the
*NL*
kibosh
on
cranks
is
to
apply
this
social
boycott
business
to
folks
big
*NL*
enough
so
you
ca
n't
reach
'em
otherwise
.
Then
if
that
do
n't
work
,
the
G.
*NL*
C.
L.
can
finally
send
a
little
delegation
around
to
inform
folks
that
*NL*
get
too
flip
that
they
got
to
conform
to
decent
standards
and
quit
*NL*
shooting
off
their
mouths
so
free
.
Do
n't
it
sound
like
the
organization
*NL*
could
do
a
great
work
?
We
've
already
got
some
of
the
strongest
men
in
*NL*
town
,
and
of
course
we
want
you
in
.
How
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
uncomfortable
.
He
felt
a
compulsion
back
to
all
the
*NL*
standards
he
had
so
vaguely
yet
so
desperately
been
fleeing
.
He
fumbled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
'd
especially
light
on
fellows
like
Seneca
Doane
and
try
*NL*
to
make
'em
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
your
sweet
life
we
would
!
Look
here
,
old
Georgie
:
I
've
never
*NL*
for
one
moment
believed
you
meant
it
when
you
've
defended
Doane
,
and
the
*NL*
strikers
and
so
on
,
at
the
Club

I
knew
you
were
simply
kidding
those
*NL*
poor
galoots
like
Sid
Finkelstein

At

I
certainly
hope
you
were

kidding

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
--
sure

Course
you
might
say

''
Babbitt
was
conscious
of
how
*NL*
feeble
he
sounded
,
conscious
of
Gunch
's
mature
and
relentless
eye
.
*NL*
``
Gosh

you
know
where

honestly

I
do
n't
think
*NL*
Doane
means
so
badly

you
got
to
remember
he
's
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``

those
lazy

Babbitt
was
relieved
to
be
let
off
so
*NL*
easily
,
but
Gunch
went
on
:
``
George

I
do
n't
know
what
's
come
over
you
;
*NL*
none
of
us
do

and
we
've
talked
a
lot
about
you
.
For
a
while
we
figured
*NL*
out
you
'd
been
upset
by
what
happened
to
poor
Riesling
,
and
we
forgave
*NL*
you
for
any
fool
thing
you
said
,
but
that
's
old
stuff
now

George

*NL*
we
ca

make
out
what
's
got
into
you

Personally
,
I
've
always
defended
*NL*
you
,
but
I
must
say
it
's
getting
too
much
for
me
.
All
the
boys
at
the
*NL*
Athletic
Club
and
the
Boosters

are
sore
,
the
way
you
go
on
deliberately
*NL*
touting
Doane
and
his
bunch
of
hell-hounds

talking
about
being
*NL*
liberal

being
wishy-washy

even
saying

all
stewed
to

here
to-day

coming
right
into
the
Thornleigh
with
a
--
well
,
she
may
be
all
right
and
*NL*
a
perfect
lady

she
certainly
did
look
like
a
pretty
gay
skirt
for
*NL*
a
fellow
with
his
wife
out
of
town
to
be
taking
to
lunch

Did
n't
look

well

over

Now
do
n't

tattling
behind

He
was
gone

*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Babbitt
dined
alone
.
He
saw
all
the
Clan
of
Good
Fellows
*NL*
peering
through
the
restaurant
window
,
spying
on
him
.
Fear
sat
beside

him

he
told
himself
that
to-night
he
would
not
go
to

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
summer
before
,
Mrs.
Babbitt
's
letters
had
crackled
with
desire
to
*NL*
return
to
Zenith
.
Now
they
said
nothing
of
returning
,
but
a
wistful
*NL*
``
I
suppose
everything
is
going
on
all
right
without
me
''
among
her
dry
*NL*
chronicles
of
weather
and
sicknesses
hinted
to
Babbitt
that
he
had
n't
*NL*
been
very
urgent
about
her
coming
.
He
worried
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
were
here
,
and
I
went
on
raising
cain
like
I
been
doing
,
she
'd
*NL*
have
a
fit
.
I
got
to
get
hold
of
myself
.
I
got
to
learn
to
play
around
*NL*
and
yet
not
make
a
fool
of
myself
.
I
can
do
it
,
too
,
if
folks
like
*NL*
Verg
Gunch
'll
let
me
alone
,
and
Myra
'll
stay
away
.
But
--
poor
kid
,
she
*NL*
sounds
lonely
.
Lord
,
I
do
n't
want
to
hurt
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Impulsively
he
wrote
that
they
missed
her
,
and
her
next
letter
said
*NL*
happily
that
she
was
coming
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
persuaded
himself
that
he
was
eager
to
see
her
.
He
bought
roses
*NL*
for
the
house
,
he
ordered
squab
for
dinner
,
he
had
the
car
cleaned
and
*NL*
polished
.
All
the
way
home
from
the
station
with
her
he
was
adequate
*NL*
in
his
accounts
of
Ted
's
success
in
basket-ball
at
the
university
,
but
*NL*
before
they
reached
Floral
Heights
there
was
nothing
more
to
say
,
and
*NL*
already
he
felt
the
force
of
her
stolidity
,
wondered
whether
he
could
*NL*
remain
a
good
husband
and
still
sneak
out
of
the
house
this
evening
for
*NL*
half
an
hour
with
the
Bunch
.
When
he
had
housed
the
car
he
blundered
*NL*
upstairs
,
into
the
familiar
talcum-scented
warmth
of
her
presence
,
*NL*
blaring
,
``
Help
you
unpack
your
bag
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
can
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
she
turned
,
holding
up
a
small
box
,
and
slowly
she
said
,
``
I
*NL*
brought
you
a
present
,
just
a
new
cigar-case
.
I
do
n't
know
if
you
'd
care
*NL*
to
have
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
lonely
girl
,
the
brown
appealing
Myra
Thompson
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
married
,
and
he
almost
wept
for
pity
as
he
kissed
her
and
besought
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
honey
,
honey
,
CARE
to
have
it
?
Of
course
I
do
!
I
'm
awful
proud
you
*NL*
brought
it
to
me
.
And
I
needed
a
new
case
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
how
he
would
get
rid
of
the
case
he
had
bought
the
week
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
really
are
glad
to
see
me
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
poor
kiddy
,
what
you
been
worrying
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
did
n't
seem
to
miss
me
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
he
had
finished
his
stint
of
lying
they
were
firmly
bound
*NL*
again
.
By
ten
that
evening
it
seemed
improbable
that
she
had
ever
*NL*
been
away
.
There
was
but
one
difference
:
the
problem
of
remaining
a
*NL*
respectable
husband
,
a
Floral
Heights
husband
,
yet
seeing
Tanis
and
*NL*
the
Bunch
with
frequency
.
He
had
promised
to
telephone
to
Tanis
that
*NL*
evening
,
and
now
it
was
melodramatically
impossible
.
He
prowled
about
*NL*
the
telephone
,
impulsively
thrusting
out
a
hand
to
lift
the
receiver
,
*NL*
but
never
quite
daring
to
risk
it
.
Nor
could
he
find
a
reason
*NL*
for
slipping
down
to
the
drug
store
on
Smith
Street
,
with
its
*NL*
telephone-booth
.
He
was
laden
with
responsibility
till
he
threw
it
off
*NL*
with
the
speculation
:
``
Why
the
deuce
should
I
fret
so
about
not
being
*NL*
able
to
`
phone
Tanis
?
She
can
get
along
without
me
.
I
do
n't
owe
her
*NL*
anything
.
She
's
a
fine
girl
,
but
I
've
given
her
just
as
much
as
she
has
*NL*
me
...
Oh
,
damn
these
women
and
the
way
they
get
you
all
tied
up
in
*NL*
complications
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
he
was
attentive
to
his
wife
,
took
her
to
the
theater
,
to
*NL*
dinner
at
the
Littlefields
'
;
then
the
old
weary
dodging
and
shifting
*NL*
began
and
at
least
two
evenings
a
week
he
spent
with
the
Bunch
.
He
still
*NL*
made
pretense
of
going
to
the
Elks
and
to
committee-meetings
but
less
*NL*
and
less
did
he
trouble
to
have
his
excuses
interesting
,
less
and
less
*NL*
did
she
affect
to
believe
them
.
He
was
certain
that
she
knew
he
was
*NL*
associating
with
what
Floral
Heights
called
``
a
sporty
crowd
,
''
yet
*NL*
neither
of
them
acknowledged
it
.
In
matrimonial
geography
the
distance
*NL*
between
the
first
mute
recognition
of
a
break
and
the
admission
thereof
*NL*
is
as
great
as
the
distance
between
the
first
naive
faith
and
the
first
*NL*
doubting
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
began
to
drift
away
he
also
began
to
see
her
as
a
human
being
,
to
*NL*
like
and
dislike
her
instead
of
accepting
her
as
a
comparatively
movable
*NL*
part
of
the
furniture
,
and
he
compassionated
that
husband-and-wife
*NL*
relation
which
,
in
twenty-five
years
of
married
life
,
had
become
a
*NL*
separate
and
real
entity
.
He
recalled
their
high
lights
the
summer
*NL*
vacation
in
Virginia
meadows
under
the
blue
wall
of
the
mountains
;
their
*NL*
motor
tour
through
Ohio
,
and
the
exploration
of
Cleveland
,
Cincinnati
,
*NL*
and
Columbus
;
the
birth
of
Verona
;
their
building
of
this
new
house
,
*NL*
planned
to
comfort
them
through
a
happy
old
age
--
chokingly
they
had
said
*NL*
that
it
might
be
the
last
home
either
of
them
would
ever
have
.
Yet
his
*NL*
most
softening
remembrance
of
these
dear
moments
did
not
keep
him
from
*NL*
barking
at
dinner
,
``
Yep
,
going
out
f
'
few
hours
.
Do
n't
sit
up
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
dare
now
to
come
home
drunk
,
and
though
he
rejoiced
in
his
*NL*
return
to
high
morality
and
spoke
with
gravity
to
Pete
and
Fulton
Bemis
*NL*
about
their
drinking
,
he
prickled
at
Myra
's
unexpressed
criticisms
and
*NL*
sulkily
meditated
that
a
``
fellow
could
n't
ever
learn
to
handle
himself
*NL*
if
he
was
always
bossed
by
a
lot
of
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
no
longer
wondered
if
Tanis
was
n't
a
bit
worn
and
sentimental
.
In
*NL*
contrast
to
the
complacent
Myra
he
saw
her
as
swift
and
air-borne
and
*NL*
radiant
,
a
fire-spirit
tenderly
stooping
to
the
hearth
,
and
however
*NL*
pitifully
he
brooded
on
his
wife
,
he
longed
to
be
with
Tanis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Babbitt
tore
the
decent
cloak
from
her
unhappiness
and
*NL*
the
astounded
male
discovered
that
she
was
having
a
small
determined
*NL*
rebellion
of
her
own
.

They
were
beside
the
fireless
fire-place
,
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Georgie

she
said
,

'll
cut

a
good

the

The
Zenith
branch
of

Higher

met
in
the
*NL*
smaller
ballroom
at
the
Hotel
Thornleigh
,
a
refined
apartment
with
pale
*NL*
green
walls
and
plaster
wreaths
of
roses
,
refined
parquet
flooring
,
and
*NL*
ultra-refined
frail
gilt
chairs
.
Here
were
gathered
sixty-five
women
and
*NL*
ten
men
.
Most
of
the
men
slouched
in
their
chairs
and
wriggled
,
while

their
wives
sat
rigidly
at
attention
,
but
two
of
them
--
red-necked
,
meaty
*NL*
men
--
were
as
respectably
devout
as
their
wives
.
They
were
newly
rich
*NL*
contractors
who
,
having
bought
houses
,
motors
,
hand-painted
pictures
,
*NL*
and
gentlemanliness
,
were
now
buying
a
refined
ready-made
philosophy
.
*NL*
It
had
been
a
toss-up
with
them
whether
to
buy
New
Thought
,
Christian
*NL*
Science
,
or
a
good
standard
high-church
model
of
Episcopalianism

*NL*
In
the
flesh
,
Mrs.
Opal
Emerson
Mudge
fell
somewhat
short
of
a
prophetic
*NL*
aspect

She
was
pony-built
and
plump
,
with
the
face
of
a
haughty
*NL*
Pekingese
,
a
button
of
a
nose
,
and
arms
so
short
that
,
despite
her
most
*NL*
indignant
endeavors
,
she
could
not
clasp
her
hands
in
front
of
her
as
*NL*
she
sat
on
the
platform
waiting
.
Her
frock
of
taffeta
and
green
velvet
,
*NL*
with
three
strings
of
glass
beads
,
and
large
folding
eye-glasses
*NL*
dangling
from
a
black
ribbon
,
was
a
triumph
of
refinement
.

voice
,
white
spats
,
*NL*
and
a
mustache
.
She
said
that
Mrs.
Mudge
would
now
make
it
plain
to
the
*NL*
simplest
intellect
how
the
Sun
Spirit
could
be
cultivated
,
and
they
who
*NL*
had
been
thinking
about
cultivating
one
would
do
well
to
treasure
Mrs.
*NL*
Mudge
's
words
,
because
even
Zenith
-LRB-
and
everybody
knew
that
Zenith
stood
*NL*
in
the
van
of
spiritual
and
New
Thought
progress
-RRB-
did
n't
often
have
*NL*
the
opportunity
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
such
an
inspiring
Optimist
and
*NL*
Metaphysical
Seer
as
Mrs.
Opal
Emerson
Mudge
,
who
had
lived
the
Life
of
*NL*
Wider
Usefulness
through
Concentration
,
and
in
the
Silence
found
those
*NL*
Secrets
of
Mental
Control
and
the
Inner
Key
which
were
immediately
*NL*
going
to
transform
and
bring
Peace
,
Power
,
and
Prosperity
to
the
unhappy
*NL*
nations
;
and
so
,
friends
,
would
they
for
this
precious
gem-studded
hour
*NL*
forget
the
Illusions
of
the
Seeming
Real
,
and
in
the
actualization
of
*NL*
the
deep-lying
Veritas
pass
,
along
with
Mrs.
Opal
Emerson
Mudge
,
to
the
*NL*
Realm
Beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mrs.
Mudge
was
rather
pudgier
than
one
would
like
one
's
swamis
,
*NL*
yogis
,
seers
,
and
initiates
,
yet
her
voice
had
the
real
professional
*NL*
note
.
It
was
refined
and
optimistic
;
it
was
overpoweringly
calm
;
it
*NL*
flowed
on
relentlessly
,
without
one
comma
,
till
Babbitt
was
hypnotized
.
*NL*
Her
favorite
word
was
``
always
,
''
which
she
pronounced
olllllle-ways
.
Her
*NL*
principal
gesture
was
a
pontifical
but
thoroughly
ladylike
blessing
with
*NL*
two
stubby
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
explained
about
this
matter
of
Spiritual
Saturation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
those
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
``
those
''
she
made
a
linked
sweetness
long
drawn
out
;
a
far-off
*NL*
delicate
call
in
a
twilight
minor
.
It
chastely
rebuked
the
restless
*NL*
husbands
,
yet
brought
them
a
message
of
healing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
those
who
have
seen
the
rim
and
outer
seeming
of
the
logos
*NL*
there
are
those
who
have
glimpsed
and
in
enthusiasm
possessed
themselves
*NL*
of
some
segment
and
portion
of
the
Logos
there
are
those
who
thus
*NL*
flicked
but
not
penetrated
and
radioactivated
by
the
Dynamis
go
always
*NL*
to
and
fro
assertative
that
they
possess
and
are
possessed
of
the
Logos
*NL*
and
the
Metaphysikos
but
this
word
I
bring
you
this
concept
I
enlarge
*NL*
that
those
that
are
not
utter
are
not
even
inceptive
and
that
holiness
*NL*
is
in
its
definitive
essence
always
always
always
whole-iness
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
proved
that
the
Essence
of
the
Sun
Spirit
was
Truth
,
but
its
Aura
and
*NL*
Effluxion
were
Cheerfulness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Face
always
the
day
with
the
dawn-laugh
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
*NL*
initiate
who
perceives
that
all
works
together
in
the
revolutions
of
*NL*
the
Wheel
and
who
answers
the
strictures
of
the
Soured
Souls
of
the
*NL*
Destructionists
with
a
Glad
Affirmation
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
went
on
for
about
an
hour
and
seven
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
Mrs.
Mudge
spoke
with
more
vigor
and
punctuation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
me
suggest
to
all
of
you
the
advantages
of
the
Theosophical
and
*NL*
Pantheistic
Oriental
Reading
Circle
,
which
I
represent
.
Our
object
is
to
*NL*
unite
all
the
manifestations
of
the
New
Era
into
one
cohesive
whole
--
New
*NL*
Thought
,
Christian
Science
,
Theosophy
,
Vedanta
,
Bahaism
,
and
the
other
*NL*
sparks
from
the
one
New
Light
.
The
subscription
is
but
ten
dollars
*NL*
a
year
,
and
for
this
mere
pittance
the
members
receive
not
only
the
*NL*
monthly
magazine
,
Pearls
of
Healing
,
but
the
privilege
of
sending
right
*NL*
to
the
president
,
our
revered
Mother
Dobbs
,
any
questions
regarding
*NL*
spiritual
progress
,
matrimonial
problems
,
health
and
well-being
*NL*
questions
,
financial
difficulties
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
to
her
with
adoring
attention
.
They
looked
genteel
.
They
*NL*
looked
ironed-out
.
They
coughed
politely
,
and
crossed
their
legs
with
*NL*
quietness
,
and
in
expensive
linen
handkerchiefs
they
blew
their
noses
*NL*
with
a
delicacy
altogether
optimistic
and
refined
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Babbitt
,
he
sat
and
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
blessedly
out
in
the
air
again
,
when
they
drove
home
*NL*
through
a
wind
smelling
of
snow
and
honest
sun
,
he
dared
not
speak
.
They
*NL*
had
been
too
near
to
quarreling
,
these
days
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
forced
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
enjoy
Mrs.
Mudge
's
talk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
I
--
What
did
you
get
out
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
starts
a
person
thinking
.
It
gets
you
out
of
a
routine
of
*NL*
ordinary
thoughts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
hand
it
to
Opal
she
is
n't
ordinary
,
but
gosh
--
Honest
,
did
*NL*
that
stuff
mean
anything
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
'm
not
trained
in
metaphysics
,
and
there
was
lots
I
could
n't
*NL*
quite
grasp
,
but
I
did
feel
it
was
inspiring
.
And
she
speaks
so
readily
.
*NL*
I
do
think
you
ought
to
have
got
something
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
!
I
swear
,
I
was
simply
astonished
,
the
way
those
women
*NL*
lapped
it
up
!
Why
the
dickens
they
want
to
put
in
their
time
listening
*NL*
to
all
that
blaa
when
they
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
certainly
better
for
them

going

smoking

drinking

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
it

not

Personally
I
do

see
a

of
difference

In
both
cases
they
're
trying
to
get
away
from
*NL*
themselves

most
everybody
is
,
these
days
,
I
guess
.
And
I
'd
certainly
*NL*
get
a
whole
lot
more
out
of
hoofing
it
in
a
good
lively
dance
,
even
*NL*
in
some
dive
,
than
sitting
looking
as
if
my
collar
was
too
tight
,
and
*NL*
feeling
too
scared
to
spit

and
listening
to
Opal
chewing
her
words

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

sure
you
do

're

them

away

``
Look
here

You
been
doing
a

around

if
I
were
leading
a
double
life

something

and
I
'm
*NL*
damn
sick
of
it

*NL*
``

even

never

*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
hard
.
With
amazement
he
found
that
he
was
n't
particularly
*NL*
sorry
.
It
was
only
with
an
effort
that
he
made
himself
more
agreeable
:

``
Well

I
did

to
get
sore

*NL*
``

you
realize

farther

farther
apart

you
ruder

ruder
to
me

I
just
do
n't
know
*NL*
what

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
moment
's
pity
for
her
bewilderment
;
he
thought
of
how
many
*NL*
deep
and
tender
things
would
be
hurt
if
they
really
``
could
n't
go
on
like
*NL*
this

But
his
pity
was
impersonal
,
and
he
was
wondering
,
``
Would
n't
it
*NL*
maybe
be
a
good
thing
if
--
Not
a
divorce
and
all
that
,
o

course
,
but
*NL*
kind
of
a
little
more
independence

*NL*
*NL*
While
she
looked
at
him
pleadingly
he
drove
on
in
a
dreadful
silence

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
he
was
away
from
her
,
while
he
kicked
about
the
garage
and
swept
*NL*
the
snow
off
the
running-board
and
examined
a
cracked
hose-connection
,
*NL*
he
repented
,
he
was
alarmed
and
astonished
that
he
could
have
flared
out
*NL*
at
his
wife
,
and
thought
fondly
how
much
more
lasting
she
was
than
the
*NL*
flighty
Bunch
.
He
went
in
to
mumble
that
he
was
``
sorry
,
did
n't
mean
to
*NL*
be
grouchy
,
''
and
to
inquire
as
to
her
interest
in
movies
.
But
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
movie
theater
he
brooded
that
he
'd
``
gone
and
tied
*NL*
himself
up
to
Myra
all
over
again
.
''
He
had
some
satisfaction
in
taking
*NL*
it
out
on
Tanis
Judique
.
``
Hang
Tanis
anyway
!
Why
'd
she
gone
and
got
him
*NL*
into
these
mix-ups
and
made
him
all
jumpy
and
nervous
and
cranky
?
Too
*NL*
many
complications
!
Cut
'em
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
peace
.
For
ten
days
he
did
not
see
Tanis
nor
telephone
to
her
,
*NL*
and
instantly
she
put
upon
him
the
compulsion
which
he
hated
.
When
*NL*
he
had
stayed
away
from
her
for
five
days
,
hourly
taking
pride
in
his
*NL*
resoluteness
and
hourly
picturing
how
greatly
Tanis
must
miss
him
,
Miss
*NL*
McGoun
reported
,
``
Mrs.
Judique
on
the
`
phone

Like
t
'
speak
t
'
you
`
bout
*NL*
some
repairs

*NL*
*NL*
Tanis
was
quick
and
quiet
:

``
Mr.
Babbitt

``
No

terribly
rushed

'll

meditated

``

kid

But
gosh
,
she
ought
n't
to
`
phone
me
at
*NL*
the
office

's
a
wonder

sympathy
`
ambitious
for

gosh

I
wo

made

compelled

call

up

to-night

sweet
*NL*
little
thing

Oh
,
cut
that
,
son
!
Now
you
've
broken
away
,
be
wise
!

*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
telephone
again
,
nor
he
,
but
after
five
more
days
she
wrote
*NL*
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Have
I
offended
you
?
You
must
know
,
dear
,
I
did
n't
mean
to
.
I
'm
so
*NL*
lonely
and
I
need
somebody
to
cheer
me
up
.
Why
did
n't
you
come
to
the
*NL*
nice
party
we
had
at
Carrie
's
last
evening
I
remember
she
invited
you
.
*NL*
Ca
n't
you
come
around
here
to-morrow
Thur
evening
?
I
shall
be
alone
and
*NL*
hope
to
see
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
His
reflections
were
numerous
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doggone
it
,
why
ca
n't
she
let
me
alone
?
Why
ca
n't
women
ever
learn
a
*NL*
fellow
hates
to
be
bulldozed
?
And
they
always
take
advantage
of
you
by
*NL*
yelling
how
lonely
they
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that

young

Nice-looking

II
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
,
the
to-morrow
of
Tanis
's
note
,
was
full
of
emotional
crises
.
*NL*
At
the
Roughnecks
'
Table
at
the
club
,
Verg
Gunch
talked
of
the
Good
*NL*
Citizens
'
League
and
-LRB-
it
seemed
to
Babbitt
-RRB-
deliberately
left
him
out
*NL*
of
the
invitations
to
join
.
Old
Mat
Penniman
,
the
general
utility
man
*NL*
at
Babbitt
's
office
,
had
Troubles
,
and
came
in
to
groan
about
them
:
his
*NL*
oldest
boy
was
``
no
good
,
''
his
wife
was
sick
,
and
he
had
quarreled
with
*NL*
his
brother-in-law
.
Conrad
Lyte
also
had
Troubles
,
and
since
Lyte
was
*NL*
one
of
his
best
clients
,
Babbitt
had
to
listen
to
them
.
Mr.
Lyte
,
it
*NL*
appeared
,
was
suffering
from
a
peculiarly
interesting
neuralgia
,
and
*NL*
the
garage
had
overcharged
him
.
When
Babbitt
came
home
,
everybody
had
*NL*
Troubles
:
his
wife
was
simultaneously
thinking
about
discharging
the
*NL*
impudent
new
maid
,
and
worried
lest
the
maid
leave
;
and
Tinka
desired
to
*NL*
denounce
her
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
quit
fussing
!
''
Babbitt
fussed
.
``
You
never
hear
me
whining
about
my
*NL*
Troubles
,
and
yet
if
you
had
to
run
a
real-estate
office
--
Why
,
to-day
I
*NL*
found
Miss
Bannigan
was
two
days
behind
with
her
accounts
,
and
I
pinched
*NL*
my
finger
in
my
desk
,
and
Lyte
was
in
and
just
as
unreasonable
as
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
vexed
that
after
dinner
,
when
it
was
time
for
a
tactful
escape
*NL*
to
Tanis
,
he
merely
grumped
to
his
wife
,
``
Got
to
go
out
.
Be
back
by
*NL*
eleven
,
should
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
're
going
out
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
!
What
do
you
mean
`
again
'
!
Have
n't
hardly
been
out
of
the
house
*NL*
for
a
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
--
are
you
going
to
the
Elks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nope
.
Got
to
see
some
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
time
he
heard
his
own
voice
and
knew
that
it
was
curt
,
*NL*
though
she
was
looking
at
him
with
wide-eyed
reproach
,
he
stumped
into
*NL*
the
hall
,
jerked
on
his
ulster
and
furlined
gloves
,
and
went
out
to
*NL*
start
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
relieved
to
find
Tanis
cheerful
,
unreproachful
,
and
brilliant
in
*NL*
a
frock
of
brown
net
over
gold
tissue
.
``
You
poor
man
,
having
to
come
*NL*
out
on
a
night
like
this
!
It
's
terribly
cold
.
Do
n't
you
think
a
small
*NL*
highball
would
be
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
by
golly
,
there
's
a
woman
with
savvy
!
I
think
we
could
more
or
*NL*
less
stand
a
highball
if
it
was
n't
too
long
a
one
--
not
over
a
foot
*NL*
tall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
with
careless
heartiness
,
he
forgot
the
compulsion
of
her
*NL*
demands
,
he
stretched
in
a
large
chair
and
felt
that
he
had
beautifully
*NL*
come
home
.
He
was
suddenly
loquacious
;
he
told
her
what
a
noble
and
*NL*
misunderstood
man
he
was
,
and
how
superior
to
Pete
,
Fulton
Bemis
,
and
*NL*
the
other
men
of
their
acquaintance
;
and
she
,
bending
forward
,
chin
*NL*
in
charming
hand
,
brightly
agreed
.
But
when
he
forced
himself
to
*NL*
ask
,
``
Well
,
honey
,
how
's
things
with
YOU
,
''
she
took
his
duty-question
*NL*
seriously
,
and
he
discovered
that
she
too
had
Troubles
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
but
--
I
did
get
so
angry
with
Carrie
.
She
told
Minnie
that
*NL*
I
told
her
that
Minnie
was
an
awful
tightwad
,
and
Minnie
told
me
Carrie
*NL*
had
told
her
,
and
of
course
I
told
her
I
had
n't
said
anything
of
the
*NL*
kind
,
and
then
Carrie
found
Minnie
had
told
me
,
and
she
was
simply
*NL*
furious
because
Minnie
had
told
me
,
and
of
course
I
was
just
boiling
*NL*
because
Carrie
had
told
her
I
'd
told
her
,
and
then
we
all
met
up
at
*NL*
Fulton
's
--
his
wife
is
away
--
thank
heavens
!
--
oh
,
there
's
the
dandiest
*NL*
floor
in
his
house
to
dance
on
--
and
we
were
all
of
us
simply
furious
*NL*
at
each
other
and
--
Oh
,
I
do
hate
that
kind
of
a
mix-up
,
do
n't
you
?
I
*NL*
mean
--
it
's
so
lacking
in
refinement
,
but
--
And
Mother
wants
to
come
and
*NL*
stay
with
me
for
a
whole
month
,
and
of
course
I
do
love
her
,
I
suppose
*NL*
I
do
,
but
honestly
,
she
'll
cramp
my
style
something
dreadful
--
she
never
*NL*
can
learn
not
to
comment
,
and
she
always
wants
to
know
where
I
'm
going
*NL*
when
I
go
out
evenings
,
and
if
I
lie
to
her
she
always
spies
around
and
*NL*
ferrets
around
and
finds
out
where
I
've
been
,
and
then
she
looks
like
*NL*
Patience
on
a
Monument
till
I
could
just
scream
.
And
oh
,
I
MUST
tell
*NL*
you
--
You
know
I
never
talk
about
myself
;
I
just
hate
people
who
do
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
?
But
--
I
feel
so
stupid
to-night
,
and
I
know
I
must
be
boring
*NL*
you
with
all
this
but
--
What
would
you
do
about
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
facile
masculine
advice
.
She
was
to
put
off
her
mother
's
*NL*
stay
.
She
was
to
tell
Carrie
to
go
to
the
deuce
.
For
these
valuable
*NL*
revelations
she
thanked
him
,
and
they
ambled
into
the
familiar
gossip
*NL*
of
the
Bunch
.
Of
what
a
sentimental
fool
was
Carrie
.
Of
what
a
lazy
*NL*
brat
was
Pete
.
Of
how
nice
Fulton
Bemis
could
be
--
``
course
lots
of
people
*NL*
think
he
's
a
regular
old
grouch
when
they
meet
him
because
he
does
n't
*NL*
give
'em
the
glad
hand
the
first
crack
out
of
the
box
,
but
when
they
get
*NL*
to
know
him
,
he
's
a
corker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
they
had
gone
conscientiously
through
each
of
these
analyses
*NL*
before
,
the
conversation
staggered
.
Babbitt
tried
to
be
intellectual
*NL*
and
deal
with
General
Topics
.
He
said
some
thoroughly
sound
things
about
*NL*
Disarmament
,
and
broad-mindedness
and
liberalism
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
General
Topics
interested
Tanis
only
when
she
could
apply
them
to
*NL*
Pete
,
Carrie
,
or
themselves
.
He
was
distressingly
conscious
of
their
*NL*
silence
.
He
tried
to
stir
her
into
chattering
again
,
but
silence
rose
*NL*
like
a
gray
presence
and
hovered
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
uh
--
''
he
labored
.
``
It
strikes
me
--
it
strikes
me
that
unemployment
is
*NL*
lessening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
Pete
will
get
a
decent
job
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desperately
he
essayed
,
``
What
's
the
trouble
,
old
honey
?
You
seem
kind
of
*NL*
quiet
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
?
Oh
,
I
'm
not
.
But
--
do
you
really
care
whether
I
am
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Care
?
Sure
!
Course
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
?
''
She
swooped
on
him
,
sat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hated
the
emotional
drain
of
having
to
appear
fond
of
her
.
He
stroked
*NL*
her
hand
,
smiled
up
at
her
dutifully
,
and
sank
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
I
wonder
if
you
really
like
me
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
I
do
,
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
,
precious
?
Do
you
care
a
bit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
certainly
!
You
do
n't
suppose
I
'd
be
here
if
I
did
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
see
here
,
young
man
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
speaking
to
me
in
that
huffy
*NL*
way
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
sound
huffy
.
I
just
--
''
In
injured
and
rather
childish
*NL*
tones
:
``
Gosh
almighty
,
it
makes
me
tired
the
way
everybody
says
I
*NL*
sound
huffy

I
just

!
Do
they
expect
me
to
sing
it
or
*NL*
something
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
do
you
mean
by
`
everybody

?
How
many
other
ladies
have
you
been
*NL*
consoling
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
now
,
I
wo
n't
have
this
hinting

''
*NL*
*NL*
Humbly
:
``
I
know
,
dear
.
I
was
only
teasing
.
I
know
it
did
n't
mean
to
talk
*NL*
huffy
--
it
was
just
tired
.
Forgive
bad
Tanis

But
say
you
love
me

say
*NL*
it
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

cynically
.
``
Oh

darling
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
rude
but

I

get
so
lonely

feel
so
useless

Nobody
needs

nothing

can
do

for
anybody

so
active

something

'm
not
*NL*
old
and
stupid

am
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
assure
her
.
She
stroked
his
hair
,
and
he
had
to
look
pleased
*NL*
under
that
touch
,
the
more
demanding
in
its
beguiling
softness
.
He
was
*NL*
impatient
.
He
wanted
to
flee
out
to
a
hard
,
sure
,
unemotional
man-world
.
*NL*
Through
her
delicate
and
caressing
fingers
she
may
have
caught
something
*NL*
of
his
shrugging
distaste
.
She
left
him
--
he
was
for
the
moment
*NL*
buoyantly
relieved
--
she
dragged
a
footstool
to
his
feet
and
sat
looking
*NL*
beseechingly
up
at
him
.
But
as
in
many
men
the
cringing
of
a
dog
,
the
*NL*
flinching
of
a
frightened
child
,
rouse
not
pity
but
a
surprised
and
*NL*
jerky
cruelty
,
so
her
humility
only
annoyed
him
.
And
he
saw
her
now
*NL*
as
middle-aged
,
as
beginning
to
be
old
.
Even
while
he
detested
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
they
rode
him
.
She
was
old
,
he
winced
.
Old
!
He
noted
how
the
*NL*
soft
flesh
was
creasing
into
webby
folds
beneath
her
chin
,
below
her
*NL*
eyes
,
at
the
base
of
her
wrists
.
A
patch
of
her
throat
had
a
minute
*NL*
roughness
like
the
crumbs
from
a
rubber
eraser
.
Old
!
She
was
younger
in
*NL*
years
than
himself
,
yet
it
was
sickening
to
have
her
yearning
up
at
him
*NL*
with
rolling
great
eyes
--
as
if
,
he
shuddered
,
his
own
aunt
were
making
*NL*
love
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fretted
inwardly
,
``
I
'm
through
with
this
asinine
fooling
around
.
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
cut
her
out
.
She
's
a
darn
decent
nice
woman
,
and
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
hurt
her
,
but
it
'll
hurt
a
lot
less
to
cut
her
right
out
,
like
a
good
*NL*
clean
surgical
operation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
his
feet
.
He
was
speaking
urgently
.
By
every
rule
of
*NL*
self-esteem
,
he
had
to
prove
to
her
,
and
to
himself
,
that
it
was
her
*NL*
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose

I
'm
kind
of
out
of

stayed
away
for
a
while
to
catch
up
on
work

everything

*NL*
figure
out
where
I
was
at
,
you
ought
to
have
been
cannier

waited
*NL*
till
I
came
back

Ca
n't
you
see

,
when
you
MADE
me
come
,
I
--
being
*NL*
about
an
average
bull-headed
chump

my
tendency
was
to
resist
?

I
'm
going
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep

Right
now

And
then

we
'll
see
about
the
future

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

`
about
the
future

Have
I
done
something
I
*NL*
ought
n't
to
?
Oh
,
I
'm
so
dreadfully
sorry
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
resolutely
put
his
hands
behind
him
.
``
Not
a
thing
,
God
bless
you
,
not
*NL*
a
thing

You
're
as
good
as
they
make
'em

But
it
's
just

Good
Lord

do

you
realize
I

a
business
to

attend
to
and

not
believe
it
,
but
I
've
got
a
wife
and
kids
*NL*
that
I
'm
awful
fond
of
!
''
Then
only
during
the
murder
he
was
committing
*NL*
was
he
able
to
feel
nobly
virtuous
.
``
I
want
us
to
be
friends

gosh

I
ca
n't
go
on

``

always

so
carefully

come
around

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
reasonable
,
she
was
so
gently
right
!
It
took
him
an
hour
to
*NL*
make
his
escape
,
with
nothing
settled
and
everything
horribly
settled
.
*NL*
In
a
barren
freedom
of
icy
Northern
wind
he
sighed
,
``
Thank
God
that
's
*NL*
over

I

*NL*
HIS
wife
was
up
when
he
came
in
.
``
Did
you
have
a
good
time

she
*NL*
sniffed

``

He
was
warning
himself
,
``
Careful

disagreeable

feels
it

being
left
alone

But
he
forgot
his

this

*NL*
``
Nope

sat

Overwhelmed
she
bent
to
his
unprecedented
tirade
,
and
in
answer
she
*NL*
mourned
:

*NL*
``
Oh

Perhaps
you
're
partly
right

Perhaps
I
am
slow
about
getting

acquainted
with

But
when
you

we
have

*NL*
*NL*
With
true
masculine
wiles
he
not
only
convinced
himself
that
she
had
*NL*
injured
him
but
,
by
the
loudness
of
his
voice
and
the
brutality
of
his
*NL*
attack
,
he
convinced
her
also
,
and
presently
he
had
her
apologizing
for
*NL*
his
having
spent
the
evening
with
Tanis
.
He
went
up
to
bed
well
pleased
,
*NL*
not
only
the
master
but
the
martyr
of
the
household
.
For
a
distasteful
*NL*
moment
after
he
had
lain
down
he
wondered
if
he
had
been
altogether
*NL*
just
.
``
Ought
to
be
ashamed

bullying

Maybe
there
is
her
side

had
such
a
bloomin

hectic
time

I

do
n't
care

Good
for
her
to
get
waked
up
a
little
.
And
I
'm
going
to
keep

free

Of
her
and
Tanis
and
the
fellows
at

going

In
this
mood
he
was
particularly
objectionable
at
the
Boosters
'
Club
*NL*
lunch
next
day
.
They
were
addressed
by
a
congressman
who
had
just
*NL*
returned
from
an
exhaustive
three-months
study
of
the
finances
,
*NL*
ethnology
,
political
systems
,
linguistic
divisions
,
mineral
resources
,
*NL*
and
agriculture
of
Germany
,
France
,
Great
Britain
,
Italy
,
Austria
,
*NL*
Czechoslovakia
,
Jugoslavia
,
and
Bulgaria
.
He
told
them
all
about
*NL*
those
subjects
,
together
with
three
funny
stories
about
European
*NL*
misconceptions
of
America
and
some
spirited
words
on
the
necessity
of
*NL*
keeping
ignorant
foreigners
out
of
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
that
was
a
mighty
informative
talk
.
Real
he-stuff
,
''
said
Sidney
*NL*
Finkelstein
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
disaffected
Babbitt
grumbled
,
``
Four-flusher
!
Bunch
of
hot
*NL*
air
!
And
what
's
the
matter
with
the
immigrants
?
Gosh
,
they
are
n't
*NL*
all
ignorant
,
and
I
got
a
hunch
we
're
all
descended
from
immigrants
*NL*
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
make
me
tired
!
''
said
Mr.
Finkelstein
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
aware
that
Dr.
A.
I.
Dilling
was
sternly
listening
from
*NL*
across
the
table
.
Dr.
Dilling
was
one
of
the
most
important
men
in
the
*NL*
Boosters
'
.
He
was
not
a
physician
but
a
surgeon
,
a
more
romantic
and
*NL*
sounding
occupation
.
He
was
an
intense
large
man
with
a
boiling
of
black
*NL*
hair
and
a
thick
black
mustache
.
The
newspapers
often
chronicled
his
*NL*
operations
;
he
was
professor
of
surgery
in
the
State
University
;
he
went
*NL*
to
dinner
at
the
very
best
houses
on
Royal
Ridge
;
and
he
was
said
to
be
*NL*
worth
several
hundred
thousand
dollars
.
It
was
dismaying
to
Babbitt
to
*NL*
have
such
a
person
glower
at
him
.
He
hastily
praised
the
congressman
's
*NL*
wit
,
to
Sidney
Finkelstein
,
but
for
Dr.
Dilling
's
benefit
.

That
afternoon
three
men
shouldered
into
Babbitt
's
office
with
the
air
*NL*
of
a
Vigilante
committee
in
frontier
days
.
They
were
large
,
resolute
,
*NL*
big-jawed
men
,
and
they
were
all
high
lords
in
the
land
of
Zenith
--
Dr.
*NL*
Dilling
the
surgeon
,
Charles
McKelvey
the
contractor
,
and
,
most
*NL*
dismaying
of
all
,
the
white-bearded
Colonel
Rutherford
Snow
,
owner
of
*NL*
the
Advocate-Times
.
In
their
whelming
presence
Babbitt
felt
small
and
*NL*
insignificant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
great
pleasure
,
have
chairs
,
what
c
'n
I
do
for
you
?
''
he
*NL*
babbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
neither
sat
nor
offered
observations
on
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Babbitt
,
''
said
Colonel
Snow
,
``
we
've
come
from
the
Good
Citizens
'
*NL*
League
.
We
've
decided
we
want
you
to
join

Vergil
Gunch
says
you
do
n't
*NL*
care
to
,
but
I
think
we
can
show
you
a
new
light
.
The
League
is
going
to
*NL*
combine
with
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
a
campaign
for
the
Open
Shop
,
so
*NL*
it
's
time
for
you
to
put
your
name
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
embarrassment
Babbitt
could
not
recall
his
reasons
for
not
*NL*
wishing
to
join
the
League
,
if
indeed
he
had
ever
definitely
known
them
,
*NL*
but
he
was
passionately
certain
that
he
did
not
wish
to
join
,
and
at
the
*NL*
thought
of
their
forcing
him
he
felt
a
stirring
of
anger
against
even
*NL*
these
princes
of
commerce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
,
Colonel
,
have
to
think
it
over
a
little
,

he
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
McKelvey
snarled
,
``
That
means
you
're
not
going
to
join

George
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
black
and
unfamiliar
and
ferocious
spoke
from
Babbitt
:
``
Now
,
*NL*
you
look
here
,
Charley
!
I
'm
damned
if
I
'm
going
to
be
bullied
into
*NL*
joining
anything
,
not
even
by
you
plutes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
bullying
anybody
,
''
Dr.
Dilling
began
,
but
Colonel
Snow
thrust
*NL*
him
aside
with
,
``
Certainly
we
are
!
We
do
n't
mind
a
little
bullying
,
if
*NL*
it
's
necessary

Babbitt
,
the
G.C.L.
has
been
talking
about
you
a
good
*NL*
deal
.
You
're
supposed
to
be
a
sensible
,
clean
,
responsible
man
;
you
*NL*
always
have
been
;
but
here
lately
,
for
God
knows
what
reason
,
I
hear
*NL*
from
all
sorts
of
sources
that
you
're
running
around
with
a
loose
*NL*
crowd
,
and
what
's
a
whole
lot
worse
,
you
've
actually
been
advocating
and
*NL*
supporting
some
of
the
most
dangerous
elements
in
town
,
like
this
fellow
*NL*
Doane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Colonel
,
that
strikes
me
as
my
private
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
but
we
want
to
have
an
understanding
.
You
've
stood
in
,
*NL*
you
and
your
father-in-law
,
with
some
of
the
most
substantial
and
*NL*
forward-looking
interests
in
town
,
like
my
friends
of
the
Street
*NL*
Traction
Company
,
and
my
papers
have
given
you
a
lot
of
boosts
.
Well
,
*NL*
you
ca
n't
expect
the
decent
citizens
to
go
on
aiding
you
if
you
intend
*NL*
to
side
with
precisely
the
people
who
are
trying
to
undermine
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
frightened
,
but
he
had
an
agonized
instinct
that
if
he
*NL*
yielded
in
this
he
would
yield
in
everything
.
He
protested
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
exaggerating
,
Colonel
.
I
believe
in
being
broad-minded

liberal

of

I
'm
just
as
much
agin
the
cranks
and
*NL*
blatherskites
and
labor
unions
and
so
on
as
you
are
.
But
fact
is
,
I
*NL*
belong
to
so
many
organizations
now
that
I
ca
n't
do
'em
justice
,
and
I
*NL*
want
to
think
it
over
before
I
decide
about
coming
into
the
G.C.L.

*NL*
*NL*
Colonel
Snow
condescended
,
``
Oh
,
no
,
I
'm
not
exaggerating
!
Why
the
doctor

here
heard
you
cussing
out
and
defaming
one
of
the
finest
types
of
*NL*
Republican
congressmen
,
just
this
noon
!
And
you
have
entirely
the
wrong

idea
about

over

We
're
not
begging
you
to
join
the
*NL*
G.C.L.

we
're
permitting
you
to
join

I
'm
not
sure

my
boy

but
what

if
you
put
it
off
it
'll
be
too
late

I

not

we
'll
want

Better

The
three
Vigilantes
,
formidable
in
their
righteousness
,
stared
at
him
*NL*
in
a
taut
silence
.
Babbitt
waited
through
.
He
thought
nothing
at
all
,
*NL*
he
merely
waited
,
while
in
his
echoing
head
buzzed
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to

``

As
Babbitt
went
out
to
his
car
that
evening
he
saw
Vergil
Gunch
coming
*NL*
down
the
block
.
He
raised
his
hand
in
salutation
,
but
Gunch
ignored
it
*NL*
and
crossed
the
street
.
He
was
certain
that
Gunch
had
seen
him
.
He
drove
*NL*
home
in
sharp
discomfort
.

*NL*
His
wife
attacked
at
once
:

longed

that
evening

to
see
Tanis

to
be
strengthened
by

her
sympathy

When
all

were
up-stairs
he
got
as
far

apartment-house

he
was
agitated

blurted

about

next
morning

When
Babbitt
was
driving
down
to

office
he
overtook
Eathorne

car

with
the
great

sitting
in
anemic

looked

Who

Only

get
an

idea
you

scatter-brained
and
unstable
,
you
do
n't
suppose
they
'll
want
*NL*
to
do
business
with
you
,
do
you

One
little
rumor
about
your
being
a
*NL*
crank
would
do
more
to
ruin
this
business
than
all
the
plots
and
stuff
*NL*
that
these
fool
story-writers
could
think
up
in
a
month
of
Sundays

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
,
when
the
old
reliable
Conrad
Lyte
,
the
merry
miser
,
*NL*
Conrad
Lyte
,
appeared
,
and
Babbitt
suggested
his
buying
a
parcel
of
land
*NL*
in
the
new
residential
section
of
Dorchester
,
Lyte
said
hastily
,
too
*NL*
hastily
,
``
No
,
no
,
do
n't
want
to
go
into
anything
new
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
Babbitt
learned
,
through
Henry
Thompson
,
that
the
officials
*NL*
of
the
Street
Traction
Company
were
planning
another
real-estate
coup
,
*NL*
and
that
Sanders
,
Torrey
and
Wing
,
not
the
Babbitt-Thompson
Company
,
*NL*
were
to
handle
it
for
them
.
``
I
figure
that
Jake
Offutt
is
kind
of
*NL*
leery
about
the
way
folks
are
talking
about
you
.
Of
course
Jake
is
a
*NL*
rock-ribbed
old
die-hard
,
and
he
probably
advised
the
Traction
fellows
*NL*
to
get
some
other
broker
.
George
,
you
got
to
do
something
!
''
trembled
*NL*
Thompson
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
a
rush
,
Babbitt
agreed
.
All
nonsense
the
way
people
misjudged
*NL*
him
,
but
still
--
He
determined
to
join
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
the
*NL*
next
time
he
was
asked
,
and
in
furious
resignation
he
waited
.
He
was
n't
*NL*
asked
.
They
ignored
him
.
He
did
not
have
the
courage
to
go
to
the
League
*NL*
and
beg
in
,
and
he
took
refuge
in
a
shaky
boast
that
he
had
``
gotten
*NL*
away
with
bucking
the
whole
city
.
Nobody
could
dictate
to
him
how
he
was
*NL*
going
to
think
and
act
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
jarred
as
by
nothing
else
when
the
paragon
of
stenographers
,
Miss
*NL*
McGoun
,
suddenly
left
him
,
though
her
reasons
were
excellent
--
she
needed
*NL*
a
rest
,
her
sister
was
sick
,
she
might
not
do
any
more
work
for
six
*NL*
months
.
He
was
uncomfortable
with
her
successor
,
Miss
Havstad
.
What
*NL*
Miss
Havstad
's
given
name
was
,
no
one
in
the
office
ever
knew
.
It
seemed
*NL*
improbable
that
she
had
a
given
name
,
a
lover
,
a
powder-puff
,
or
a
*NL*
digestion
.
She
was
so
impersonal
,
this
slight
,
pale
,
industrious
Swede
,
*NL*
that
it
was
vulgar
to
think
of
her
as
going
to
an
ordinary
home
to
eat
*NL*
hash
.
She
was
a
perfectly
oiled
and
enameled
machine
,
and
she
ought
,
*NL*
each
evening
,
to
have
been
dusted
off
and
shut
in
her
desk
beside
her
*NL*
too-slim
,
too-frail
pencil
points
.
She
took
dictation
swiftly
,
her
*NL*
typing
was
perfect
,
but
Babbitt
became
jumpy
when
he
tried
to
work
with
*NL*
her
.
She
made
him
feel
puffy
,
and
at
his
best-beloved
daily
jokes
she
*NL*
looked
gently
inquiring
.
He
longed
for
Miss
McGoun
's
return
,
and
thought
*NL*
of
writing
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
heard
that
Miss
McGoun
had
,
a
week
after
leaving
him
,
gone
over
*NL*
to
his
dangerous
competitors
,
Sanders
,
Torrey
and
Wing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
merely
annoyed
;
he
was
frightened
.
``
Why
did
she
quit
,
then
?
''
*NL*
he
worried
.
``
Did
she
have
a
hunch
my
business
is
going
on
the
rocks
?
And
*NL*
it
was
Sanders
got
the
Street
Traction
deal
.
Rats
--
sinking
ship
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gray
fear
loomed
always
by
him
now
.
He
watched
Fritz
Weilinger
,
the
*NL*
young
salesman
,
and
wondered
if
he
too
would
leave
.
Daily
he
fancied
*NL*
slights
.
He
noted
that
he
was
not
asked
to
speak
at
the
annual
Chamber
*NL*
of
Commerce
dinner
.
When
Orville
Jones
gave
a
large
poker
party
and
he
*NL*
was
not
invited
,
he
was
certain
that
he
had
been
snubbed
.
He
was
afraid
*NL*
to
go
to
lunch
at
the
Athletic
Club
,
and
afraid
not
to
go
.
He
believed
*NL*
that
he
was
spied
on
;
that
when
he
left
the
table
they
whispered
about
*NL*
him
.
Everywhere
he
heard
the
rustling
whispers
:
in
the
offices
of
*NL*
clients
,
in
the
bank
when
he
made
a
deposit
,
in
his
own
office
,
in
his
*NL*
own
home
.
Interminably
he
wondered
what
They
were
saying
of
him
.
All
day
*NL*
long
in
imaginary
conversations
he
caught
them
marveling
,
``
Babbitt
?
*NL*
Why
,
say
,
he
's
a
regular
anarchist
!
You
got
to
admire
the
fellow
for
his
*NL*
nerve
,
the
way
he
turned
liberal
and
,
by
golly
,
just
absolutely
runs
his
*NL*
life
to
suit
himself
,
but
say
,
he
's
dangerous
,
that
's
what
he
is
,
and
*NL*
he
's
got
to
be
shown
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
twitchy
that
when
he
rounded
a
corner
and
chanced
on
two
*NL*
acquaintances
talking
--
whispering
--
his
heart
leaped
,
and
he
stalked
*NL*
by
like
an
embarrassed
schoolboy
.
When
he
saw
his
neighbors
Howard
*NL*
Littlefield
and
Orville
Jones
together
,
he
peered
at
them
,
went
indoors
*NL*
to
escape
their
spying
,
and
was
miserably
certain
that
they
had
been
*NL*
whispering
--
plotting
--
whispering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
all
his
fear
ran
defiance
.
He
felt
stubborn
.
Sometimes
he
*NL*
decided
that
he
had
been
a
very
devil
of
a
fellow
,
as
bold
as
Seneca
*NL*
Doane
;
sometimes
he
planned
to
call
on
Doane
and
tell
him
what
a
*NL*
revolutionist
he
was
,
and
never
got
beyond
the
planning
.
But
just
as
*NL*
often
,
when
he
heard
the
soft
whispers
enveloping
him
he
wailed
,
``
Good
*NL*
Lord
,
what
have
I
done
?
Just
played
with
the
Bunch
,
and
called
down
*NL*
Clarence
Drum
about
being
such
a
high-and-mighty
sodger
.
Never
catch
ME
*NL*
criticizing
people
and
trying
to
make
them
accept
MY
ideas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
stand
the
strain
.
Before
long
he
admitted
that
he
would
*NL*
like
to
flee
back
to
the
security
of
conformity
,
provided
there
was
a
*NL*
decent
and
creditable
way
to
return
.
But
,
stubbornly
,
he
would
not
be
*NL*
forced
back
;
he
would
not
,
he
swore
,
``
eat
dirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
in
spirited
engagements
with
his
wife
did
these
turbulent
fears
*NL*
rise
to
the
surface
.
She
complained
that
he
seemed
nervous
,
that
*NL*
she
could
n't
understand
why
he
did
not
want
to
``
drop
in
at
the
*NL*
Littlefields
'
''
for
the
evening
.
He
tried
,
but
he
could
not
express
to
*NL*
her
the
nebulous
facts
of
his
rebellion
and
punishment
.
And
,
with
Paul
*NL*
and
Tanis
lost
,
he
had
no
one
to
whom
he
could
talk
.
``
Good
Lord
,
Tinka
*NL*
is
the
only
real
friend
I
have
,
these
days
,
''
he
sighed
,
and
he
clung
to
*NL*
the
child
,
played
floor-games
with
her
all
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
considered
going
to
see
Paul
in
prison
,
but
,
though
he
had
a
pale
*NL*
curt
note
from
him
every
week
,
he
thought
of
Paul
as
dead
.
It
was
Tanis
*NL*
for
whom
he
was
longing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
was
so
smart
and
independent
,
cutting
Tanis
out
,
and
I
need
*NL*
her
,
Lord
how
I
need
her
!
''
he
raged
.
``
Myra
simply
ca
n't
understand
.
All
*NL*
she
sees
in
life
is
getting
along
by
being
just
like
other
folks
.
But
*NL*
Tanis
,
she
'd
tell
me
I
was
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
broke
,
and
one
evening
,
late
,
he
did
run
to
Tanis
.
He
had
not
*NL*
dared
to
hope
for
it
,
but
she
was
in
,
and
alone
.
Only
she
was
n't
Tanis
.
*NL*
She
was
a
courteous
,
brow-lifting
,
ice-armored
woman
who
looked
like
*NL*
Tanis
.
She
said
,
``
Yes
,
George
,
what
is
it
?
''
in
even
and
uninterested
*NL*
tones
,
and
he
crept
away
,
whipped
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
comfort
was
from
Ted
and
Eunice
Littlefield
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
danced
in
one
evening
when
Ted
was
home
from
the
university
,
and
*NL*
Ted
chuckled
,
``
What
's
this
I
hear
from
Euny
,
dad
?
She
says
her
dad
says
*NL*
you
raised
Cain
by
boosting
old
Seneca
Doane
.
Hot
dog
!
Give
'em
fits
!
*NL*
Stir
'em
up
!
This
old
burg
is
asleep
!
''
Eunice
plumped
down
on
Babbitt
's
*NL*
lap
,
kissed
him
,
nestled
her
bobbed
hair
against
his
chin
,
and
crowed
;
*NL*
``
I
think
you
're
lots
nicer
than
Howard
.
Why
is
it
,
''
confidentially
,
*NL*
``
that
Howard
is
such
an
old
grouch
?
The
man
has
a
good
heart
,
and
*NL*
honestly
,
he
's
awfully
bright
,
but
he
never
will
learn
to
step
on
the
*NL*
gas
,
after
all
the
training
I
've
given
him
.
Do
n't
you
think
we
could
do
*NL*
something
with
him
,
dearest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Eunice
,
that
is
n't
a
nice
way
to
speak
of
your
papa
,
''
Babbitt
*NL*
observed
,
in
the
best
Floral
Heights
manner
,
but
he
was
happy
for
*NL*
the
first
time
in
weeks
.
He
pictured
himself
as
the
veteran
liberal
*NL*
strengthened
by
the
loyalty
of
the
young
generation
.
They
went
out
to
*NL*
rifle
the
ice-box
.
Babbitt
gloated
,
``
If
your
mother
caught
us
at
this
,
*NL*
we
'd
certainly
get
our
come-uppance
!
''
and
Eunice
became
maternal
,
*NL*
scrambled
a
terrifying
number
of
eggs
for
them
,
kissed
Babbitt
on
the
*NL*
ear
,
and
in
the
voice
of
a
brooding
abbess
marveled
,
``
It
beats
the
devil
*NL*
why
feminists
like
me
still
go
on
nursing
these
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
stimulated
,
Babbitt
was
reckless
when
he
encountered
Sheldon
*NL*
Smeeth
,
educational
director
of
the
Y.M.C.A.
and
choir-leader
of
the
*NL*
Chatham
Road
Church
.
With
one
of
his
damp
hands
Smeeth
imprisoned
*NL*
Babbitt
's
thick
paw
while
he
chanted
,
``
Brother
Babbitt
,
we
have
n't
seen
*NL*
you
at
church
very
often
lately
.
I
know
you
're
busy
with
a
multitude
*NL*
of
details
,
but
you
must
n't
forget
your
dear
friends
at
the
old
church
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
shook
off
the
affectionate
clasp
--
Sheldy
liked
to
hold
hands
for
*NL*
a
long
time
--
and
snarled
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
you
fellows
can
run
the
show
*NL*
without
me
.
Sorry
,
Smeeth
;
got
to
beat
it
.
G'day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
afterward
he
winced
,
``
If
that
white
worm
had
the
nerve
to
try
to
*NL*
drag
me
back
to
the
Old
Church
Home
,
then
the
holy
outfit
must
have
been
*NL*
doing
a
lot
of
talking
about
me
,
too

*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
them
whispering
--
whispering
--
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
,
*NL*
Cholmondeley
Frink
,
even
William
Washington
Eathorne
.
The
independence
*NL*
seeped
out
of
him
and
he
walked
the
streets
alone
,
afraid
of
men
's
*NL*
cynical
eyes
and
the
incessant
hiss
of
whispering

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
HE
tried
to
explain
to
his
wife
,
as
they
prepared
for
bed
,
how
*NL*
objectionable
was
Sheldon
Smeeth
,
but
all
her
answer
was
,
``
He
has
such
*NL*
a
beautiful
voice
--
so
spiritual
.
I
do
n't
think
you
ought
to
speak
of
him
*NL*
like
that
just
because
you
ca
n't
appreciate
music
!
''
He
saw
her
then
as
a
*NL*
stranger
;
he
stared
bleakly
at
this
plump
and
fussy
woman
with
the
broad
*NL*
bare
arms
,
and
wondered
how
she
had
ever
come
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
chilly
cot
,
turning
from
aching
side
to
side
,
he
pondered
of
*NL*
Tanis
.
``
He
'd
been
a
fool
to
lose
her
.
He
had
to
have
somebody
he
could
*NL*
really
talk
to
.
He
'd
--
oh
,
he
'd
BUST
if
he
went
on
stewing
about
things
*NL*
by
himself
.
And
Myra
,
useless
to
expect
her
to
understand
.
Well
,
rats
,
*NL*
no
use
dodging
the
issue
.
Darn
shame
for
two
married
people
to
drift
*NL*
apart
after
all
these
years
;
darn
rotten
shame
;
but
nothing
could
bring
*NL*
them
together
now
,
as
long
as
he
refused
to
let
Zenith
bully
him
into
*NL*
taking
orders
--
and
he
was
by
golly
not
going
to
let
anybody
bully
him
*NL*
into
anything
,
or
wheedle
him
or
coax
him
either
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
at
three
,
roused
by
a
passing
motor
,
and
struggled
out
of
bed
*NL*
for
a
drink
of
water
.
As
he
passed
through
the
bedroom
he
heard
his
wife
*NL*
groan
.
His
resentment
was
night-blurred
;
he
was
solicitous
in
inquiring
,
*NL*
``
What
's
the
trouble
,
hon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
--
such
a
pain
down
here
in
my
side
--
oh
,
it
's
just
--
it
tears
at
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
indigestion
?
Shall
I
get
you
some
bicarb
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

that
would
help

I
felt
funny
last
evening
and
yesterday
,
*NL*
and
then
--
oh
!
--
it
passed
away
and
I
got
to
sleep
and
--
That
auto
woke
me
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
laboring
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
.
He
was
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
better
call
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
It
'll
go
away

But
maybe
you
might
get
me
an
ice-bag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stalked
to
the
bathroom
for
the
ice-bag
,
down
to
the
kitchen
for
ice
.
*NL*
He
felt
dramatic
in
this
late-night
expedition
,
but
as
he
gouged
the
*NL*
chunk
of
ice
with
the
dagger-like
pick
he
was
cool
,
steady
,
mature
;
*NL*
and
the
old
friendliness
was
in
his
voice
as
he
patted
the
ice-bag
into
*NL*
place
on
her
groin
,
rumbling
,
``
There
,
there
,
that
'll
be
better
now
.
''
*NL*
He
retired
to
bed
,
but
he
did
not
sleep
.
He
heard
her
groan
again
.
*NL*
Instantly
he
was
up
,
soothing
her
,
``
Still
pretty
bad
,
honey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
just
gripes
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
get
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
faint
.
He
knew
her
dread
of
doctors
'
verdicts
and
he
*NL*
did
not
inform
her
,
but
he
creaked
down-stairs
,
telephoned
to
Dr.
*NL*
Earl
Patten
,
and
waited
,
shivering
,
trying
with
fuzzy
eyes
to
read
a
*NL*
magazine
,
till
he
heard
the
doctor
's
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
youngish
and
professionally
breezy
.
He
came
in
as
though
*NL*
it
were
sunny
noontime
.
``
Well
,
George
,
little
trouble
,
eh
?
How
is
*NL*
she
now
?
''
he
said
busily
as
,
with
tremendous
and
rather
irritating
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
he
tossed
his
coat
on
a
chair
and
warmed
his
hands
at
*NL*
a
radiator
.
He
took
charge
of
the
house
.
Babbitt
felt
ousted
and
*NL*
unimportant
as
he
followed
the
doctor
up
to
the
bedroom
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
doctor
who
chuckled
,
``
Oh
,
just
little
stomach-ache
''
when
Verona
peeped
*NL*
through
her
door
,
begging
,
``
What
is
it
,
Dad
,
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Mrs.
Babbitt
the
doctor
said
with
amiable
belligerence
,
after
his
*NL*
examination
,
``
Kind
of
a
bad
old
pain
,
eh
?
I
'll
give
you
something
to
*NL*
make
you
sleep
,
and
I
think
you
'll
feel
better
in
the
morning
.
I
'll
come
*NL*
in
right
after
breakfast
.
''
But
to
Babbitt
,
lying
in
wait
in
the
lower
*NL*
hall
,
the
doctor
sighed
,
``
I
do
n't
like
the
feeling
there
in
her
belly
.
*NL*
There
's
some
rigidity
and
some
inflammation
.
She
's
never
had
her
*NL*
appendix
out
has
she
?
Um
.
Well
,
no
use
worrying
.
I
'll
be
here
first
*NL*
thing
in
the
morning
,
and
meantime
she
'll
get
some
rest
.
I
've
given
her
*NL*
a
hypo
.
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
was
Babbitt
caught
up
in
the
black
tempest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
all
the
indignations
which
had
been
dominating
him
and
the
*NL*
spiritual
dramas
through
which
he
had
struggled
became
pallid
and
*NL*
absurd
before
the
ancient
and
overwhelming
realities
,
the
standard
and
*NL*
traditional
realities
,
of
sickness
and
menacing
death
,
the
long
night
,
*NL*
and
the
thousand
steadfast
implications
of
married
life
.
He
crept
back
*NL*
to
her
.
As
she
drowsed
away
in
the
tropic
languor
of
morphia
,
he
sat
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
her
bed
,
holding
her
hand
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
*NL*
weeks
her
hand
abode
trustfully
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
draped
himself
grotesquely
in
his
toweling
bathrobe
and
a
pink
and
*NL*
white
couch-cover
,
and
sat
lumpishly
in
a
wing-chair
.
The
bedroom
was
*NL*
uncanny
in
its
half-light
,
which
turned
the
curtains
to
lurking
robbers
,
*NL*
the
dressing-table
to
a
turreted
castle
.
It
smelled
of
cosmetics
,
of
*NL*
linen
,
of
sleep
.
He
napped
and
woke
,
napped
and
woke
,
a
hundred
times
.
*NL*
He
heard
her
move
and
sigh
in
slumber
;
he
wondered
if
there
was
n't
some
*NL*
officious
brisk
thing
he
could
do
for
her
,
and
before
he
could
quite
*NL*
form
the
thought
he
was
asleep
,
racked
and
aching
.
The
night
was
*NL*
infinite
.
When
dawn
came
and
the
waiting
seemed
at
an
end
,
he
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
and
was
vexed
to
have
been
caught
off
his
guard
,
to
have
been
*NL*
aroused
by
Verona
's
entrance
and
her
agitated
``
Oh
,
what
is
it
,
Dad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
was
awake
,
her
face
sallow
and
lifeless
in
the
morning
light
,
*NL*
but
now
he
did
not
compare
her
with
Tanis
;
she
was
not
merely
A
Woman
,
*NL*
to
be
contrasted
with
other
women
,
but
his
own
self
,
and
though
he
might
*NL*
criticize
her
and
nag
her
,
it
was
only
as
he
might
criticize
and
nag
*NL*
himself
,
interestedly
,
unpatronizingly
,
without
the
expectation
of
*NL*
changing
--
or
any
real
desire
to
change
--
the
eternal
essence
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Verona
he
sounded
fatherly
again
,
and
firm
.
He
consoled
Tinka
,
who
*NL*
satisfactorily
pointed
the
excitement
of
the
hour
by
wailing
.
He
ordered
*NL*
early
breakfast
,
and
wanted
to
look
at
the
newspaper
,
and
felt
somehow
*NL*
heroic
and
useful
in
not
looking
at
it
.
But
there
were
still
crawling
*NL*
and
totally
unheroic
hours
of
waiting
before
Dr.
Patten
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
see
much
change
,
''
said
Patten
.
``
I
'll
be
back
about
eleven
,
and
*NL*
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
think
I
'll
bring
in
some
other
world-famous
*NL*
pill-pedler
for
consultation
,
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
.
Now
*NL*
George
,
there
's
nothing
you
can
do
.
I
'll
have
Verona
keep
the
ice-bag
*NL*
filled
--
might
as
well
leave
that
on
,
I
guess
--
and
you
,
you
better
beat
*NL*
it
to
the
office
instead
of
standing
around
her
looking
as
if
you
were
*NL*
the
patient
.
The
nerve
of
husbands
!
Lot
more
neurotic
than
the
women
!
*NL*
They
always
have
to
horn
in
and
get
all
the
credit
for
feeling
bad
when
*NL*
their
wives
are
ailing
.
Now
have
another
nice
cup
of
coffee
and
git
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
this
derision
Babbitt
became
more
matter-of-fact
.
He
drove
to
the
*NL*
office
,
tried
to
dictate
letters
,
tried
to
telephone
and
,
before
the
*NL*
call
was
answered
,
forgot
to
whom
he
was
telephoning
.
At
a
quarter
after
*NL*
ten
he
returned
home
.
As
he
left
the
down-town
traffic
and
sped
up
the
*NL*
car
,
his
face
was
as
grimly
creased
as
the
mask
of
tragedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
greeted
him
with
surprise
.
``
Why
did
you
come
back
,
dear
?
I
*NL*
think
I
feel
a
little
better
.
I
told
Verona
to
skip
off
to
her
office
.
*NL*
Was
it
wicked
of
me
to
go
and
get
sick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
that
she
wanted
petting
,
and
she
got
it
,
joyously
.
They
were
*NL*
curiously
happy
when
he
heard
Dr.
Patten
's
car
in
front
.
He
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
He
was
frightened
.
With
Patten
was
an
impatient
man
*NL*
with
turbulent
black
hair
and
a
hussar
mustache
--
Dr.
A.
I.
Dilling
,
*NL*
the
surgeon
.
Babbitt
sputtered
with
anxiety
,
tried
to
conceal
it
,
and
*NL*
hurried
down
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Patten
was
profusely
casual
:
``
Do
n't
want
to
worry
you
,
old
man
,
but
*NL*
I
thought
it
might
be
a
good
stunt
to
have
Dr.
Dilling
examine
her
.
''
He
*NL*
gestured
toward
Dilling
as
toward
a
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dilling
nodded
in
his
curtest
manner
and
strode
up-stairs
Babbitt
*NL*
tramped
the
living-room
in
agony
.
Except
for
his
wife
's
confinements
*NL*
there
had
never
been
a
major
operation
in
the
family
,
and
to
him
surgery
*NL*
was
at
once
a
miracle
and
an
abomination
of
fear
.
But
when
Dilling
and
*NL*
Patten
came
down
again
he
knew
that
everything
was
all
right
,
and
he
*NL*
wanted
to
laugh
,
for
the
two
doctors
were
exactly
like
the
bearded
*NL*
physicians
in
a
musical
comedy
,
both
of
them
rubbing
their
hands
and
*NL*
looking
foolishly
sagacious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Dilling
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
old
man
,
but
it
's
acute
appendicitis
.
We
ought
to
operate
.
*NL*
Of
course
you
must
decide
,
but
there
's
no
question
as
to
what
has
to
be
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
did
not
get
all
the
force
of
it
.
He
mumbled
,
``
Well
I
suppose
we
*NL*
could
get
her
ready
in
a
couple
o
'
days
.
Probably
Ted
ought
to
come
down
*NL*
from
the
university
,
just
in
case
anything
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Dilling
growled
,
``
Nope
.
If
you
do
n't
want
peritonitis
to
set
in
,
*NL*
we
'll
have
to
operate
right
away
.
I
must
advise
it
strongly
.
If
you
say
*NL*
go
ahead
,
I
'll
`
phone
for
the
St.
Mary
's
ambulance
at
once
,
and
we
'll
*NL*
have
her
on
the
table
in
three-quarters
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
Of
course
,
I
suppose
you
know
what
--
But
great
God
,
man
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
get
her
clothes
ready
and
everything
in
two
seconds
,
you
know
!
And
in
*NL*
her
state
,
so
wrought-up
and
weak
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
throw
her
hair-brush
and
comb
and
tooth-brush
in
a
bag
;
that
's
*NL*
all
she
'll
need
for
a
day
or
two
,
''
said
Dr.
Dilling
,
and
went
to
the
*NL*
telephone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
galloped
desperately
up-stairs
.
He
sent
the
frightened
Tinka
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
He
said
gaily
to
his
wife
,
``
Well
,
old
thing
,
the
doc
thinks
*NL*
maybe
we
better
have
a
little
operation
and
get
it
over
.
Just
take
a
few
*NL*
minutes
--
not
half
as
serious
as
a
confinement
--
and
you
'll
be
all
right
*NL*
in
a
jiffy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gripped
his
hand
till
the
fingers
ached
.
She
said
patiently
,
like
a
*NL*
cowed
child
,
``
I
'm
afraid
--
to
go
into
the
dark
,
all
alone
!
''
Maturity
was
*NL*
wiped
from
her
eyes
;
they
were
pleading
and
terrified
.
``
Will
you
stay
*NL*
with
me
?
Darling
,
you
do
n't
have
to
go
to
the
office
now
,
do
you
?
Could
*NL*
you
just
go
down
to
the
hospital
with
me
?
Could
you
come
see
me
this
*NL*
evening
--
if
everything
's
all
right
?
You
wo
n't
have
to
go
out
this
*NL*
evening
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
his
knees
by
the
bed
.
While
she
feebly
ruffled
his
hair
,
he
*NL*
sobbed
,
he
kissed
the
lawn
of
her
sleeve
,
and
swore
,
``
Old
honey
,
I
*NL*
love
you
more
than
anything
in
the
world
!
I
've
kind
of
been
worried
by
*NL*
business
and
everything
,
but
that
's
all
over
now
,
and
I
'm
back
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
really
?
George
,
I
was
thinking
,
lying
here
,
maybe
it
would
be
a
*NL*
good
thing
if
I
just
WENT
.
I
was
wondering
if
anybody
really
needed
me
.
*NL*
Or
wanted
me
.
I
was
wondering
what
was
the
use
of
my
living
.
I
've
been
*NL*
getting
so
stupid
and
ugly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
old
humbug
!
Fishing
for
compliments
when
I
ought
to
be
packing
*NL*
your
bag
!
Me
,
sure
,
I
'm
young
and
handsome
and
a
regular
village
*NL*
cut-up
and
--
''
He
could
not
go
on
.
He
sobbed
again
;
and
in
muttered
*NL*
incoherencies
they
found
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
packed
,
his
brain
was
curiously
clear
and
swift
.
He
'd
have
no
more
*NL*
wild
evenings
,
he
realized
.
He
admitted
that
he
would
regret
them
.
A
*NL*
little
grimly
he
perceived
that
this
had
been
his
last
despairing
fling
*NL*
before
the
paralyzed
contentment
of
middle-age
.
Well
,
and
he
grinned
*NL*
impishly
,
``
it
was
one
doggone
good
party
while
it
lasted
!
''
And
--
how
much
*NL*
was
the
operation
going
to
cost
?
``
I
ought
to
have
fought
that
out
with
*NL*
Dilling
.
But
no
,
damn
it
,
I
do
n't
care
how
much
it
costs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
motor
ambulance
was
at
the
door
.
Even
in
his
grief
the
Babbitt
who
*NL*
admired
all
technical
excellences
was
interested
in
the
kindly
skill
*NL*
with
which
the
attendants
slid
Mrs.
Babbitt
upon
a
stretcher
and
carried
*NL*
her
down-stairs
.
The
ambulance
was
a
huge
,
suave
,
varnished
,
white
*NL*
thing
.
Mrs.
Babbitt
moaned
,
``
It
frightens
me
.
It
's
just
like
a
hearse
,
*NL*
just
like
being
put
in
a
hearse

I
want
you
to
stay
with
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
right
up
front
with
the
driver

Babbitt
promised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
want
you
to
stay
inside
with
me

''
To
the
attendants
:
``
Ca
n't
he
be
*NL*
inside
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
ma'am
,
you
bet
.
There
's
a
fine
little
camp-stool
in
there
,
''
the
*NL*
older
attendant
said
,
with
professional
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
beside
her
in
that
traveling
cabin
with
its
cot
,
its
stool
,
its
*NL*
active
little
electric
radiator
,
and
its
quite
unexplained
calendar
,
*NL*
displaying
a
girl
eating
cherries
,
and
the
name
of
an
enterprising
*NL*
grocer
.
But
as
he
flung
out
his
hand
in
hopeless
cheerfulness
it
touched
*NL*
the
radiator
,
and
he
squealed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ouch
!
Jesus
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
George
Babbitt
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
cursing
and
swearing
and
*NL*
blaspheming

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

awful
sorry

Gosh
all
fish-hooks

look
how
I
burned
my

Gee
whiz

it
hurts

It
hurts
like
the
mischief
!
Why
,
that
damn
*NL*
radiator
is
hot
as
--
it
's
hot
as
--
it
's
hotter
'n
the
hinges
of
Hades
!
*NL*
Look
!
You
can
see
the
mark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
as
they
drove
up
to
St.
Mary
's
Hospital
,
with
the
nurses
already
*NL*
laying
out
the
instruments
for
an
operation
to
save
her
life
,
it
was
*NL*
she
who
consoled
him
and
kissed
the
place
to
make
it
well
,
and
though
*NL*
he
tried
to
be
gruff
and
mature
,
he
yielded
to
her
and
was
glad
to
be
*NL*
babied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ambulance
whirled
under
the
hooded
carriage-entrance
of
the
*NL*
hospital
,
and
instantly
he
was
reduced
to
a
zero
in
the
nightmare
*NL*
succession
of
cork-floored
halls
,
endless
doors
open
on
old
women
*NL*
sitting
up
in
bed
,
an
elevator
,
the
anesthetizing
room
,
a
young
interne
*NL*
contemptuous
of
husbands
.
He
was
permitted
to
kiss
his
wife
;
he
saw
a
*NL*
thin
dark
nurse
fit
the
cone
over
her
mouth
and
nose
;
he
stiffened
at
a
*NL*
sweet
and
treacherous
odor
;
then
he
was
driven
out
,
and
on
a
high
stool
*NL*
in
a
laboratory
he
sat
dazed
,
longing
to
see
her
once
again
,
to
insist
*NL*
that
he
had
always
loved
her
,
had
never
for
a
second
loved
anybody
else
*NL*
or
looked
at
anybody
else
.
In
the
laboratory
he
was
conscious
only
of
a
*NL*
decayed
object
preserved
in
a
bottle
of
yellowing
alcohol
.
It
made
him
*NL*
very
sick
,
but
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
.
He
was
more
aware
of
*NL*
it
than
of
waiting
.
His
mind
floated
in
abeyance
,
coming
back
always
*NL*
to
that
horrible
bottle
.
To
escape
it
he
opened
the
door
to
the
right
,
*NL*
hoping
to
find
a
sane
and
business-like
office
.
He
realized
that
he
was
*NL*
looking
into
the
operating-room
;
in
one
glance
he
took
in
Dr.
Dilling
,
*NL*
strange
in
white
gown
and
bandaged
head
,
bending
over
the
steel
table
*NL*
with
its
screws
and
wheels
,
then
nurses
holding
basins
and
cotton
*NL*
sponges
,
and
a
swathed
thing
,
just
a
lifeless
chin
and
a
mound
of
white
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
which
was
a
square
of
sallow
flesh
with
a
gash
a
little
*NL*
bloody
at
the
edges
,
protruding
from
the
gash
a
cluster
of
forceps
like
*NL*
clinging
parasites
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
the
door
with
haste
.
It
may
be
that
his
frightened
repentance
of
*NL*
the
night
and
morning
had
not
eaten
in
,
but
this
dehumanizing
interment
*NL*
of
her
who
had
been
so
pathetically
human
shook
him
utterly
,
and
as
he
*NL*
crouched
again
on
the
high
stool
in
the
laboratory
he
swore
faith
to
his
*NL*
wife
...
to
Zenith
...
to
business
efficiency
...
to
the
Boosters
'
*NL*
Club
...
to
every
faith
of
the
Clan
of
Good
Fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
nurse
was
soothing
,
``
All
over
!
Perfect
success
!
She
'll
come
out
*NL*
fine
!
She
'll
be
out
from
under
the
anesthetic
soon
,
and
you
can
see
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
her
on
a
curious
tilted
bed
,
her
face
an
unwholesome
yellow
but
*NL*
her
purple
lips
moving
slightly
.
Then
only
did
he
really
believe
that
*NL*
she
was
alive
.
She
was
muttering
.
He
bent
,
and
heard
her
sighing
,
``
Hard
*NL*
get
real
maple
syrup
for
pancakes
.
''
He
laughed
inexhaustibly
;
he
beamed
*NL*
on
the
nurse
and
proudly
confided
,
``
Think
of
her
talking
about
maple
*NL*
syrup
!
By
golly
,
I
'm
going
to
go
and
order
a
hundred
gallons
of
it
,
*NL*
right
from
Vermont
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
out
of
the
hospital
in
seventeen
days
.
He
went
to
see
her
each
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
in
their
long
talks
they
drifted
back
to
intimacy
.
Once
*NL*
he
hinted
something
of
his
relations
to
Tanis
and
the
Bunch
,
and
she
was
*NL*
inflated
by
the
view
that
a
Wicked
Woman
had
captivated
her
poor
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
once
he
had
doubted
his
neighbors
and
the
supreme
charm
of
the
Good
*NL*
Fellows
,
he
was
convinced
now
.
You
did
n't
,
he
noted
,
``
see
Seneca
Doane
*NL*
coming
around
with
any
flowers
or
dropping
in
to
chat
with
the
Missus
,
''
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Howard
Littlefield
brought
to
the
hospital
her
priceless
wine
*NL*
jelly
-LRB-
flavored
with
real
wine
-RRB-
;
Orville
Jones
spent
hours
in
picking
*NL*
out
the
kind
of
novels
Mrs.
Babbitt
liked
--
nice
love
stories
about
New
*NL*
York
millionaries
and
Wyoming
cowpunchers
;
Louetta
Swanson
knitted
a
*NL*
pink
bed-jacket
;
Sidney
Finkelstein
and
his
merry
brown-eyed
flapper
of
*NL*
a
wife
selected
the
prettiest
nightgown
in
all
the
stock
of
Parcher
and
*NL*
Stein
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
his
friends
ceased
whispering
about
him
,
suspecting
him
.
At
the
*NL*
Athletic
Club
they
asked
after
her
daily
.
Club
members
whose
names
he
*NL*
did
not
know
stopped
him
to
inquire
,
``
How
's
your
good
lady
getting
on
?
''
*NL*
Babbitt
felt
that
he
was
swinging
from
bleak
uplands
down
into
the
rich
*NL*
warm
air
of
a
valley
pleasant
with
cottages
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
noon
Vergil
Gunch
suggested
,
``
You
planning
to
be
at
the
hospital
*NL*
about
six
?
The
wife
and
I
thought
we
'd
drop
in
.
''
They
did
drop
in
.
Gunch
*NL*
was
so
humorous
that
Mrs.
Babbitt
said
he
must
``
stop
making
her
laugh
*NL*
because
honestly
it
was
hurting
her
incision
.
''
As
they
passed
down
the
*NL*
hall
Gunch
demanded
amiably
,
``
George
,
old
scout
,
you
were
soreheaded
*NL*
about
something
,
here
a
while
back
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
and
it
's
none
of
*NL*
my
business
.
But
you
seem
to
be
feeling
all
hunky-dory
again
,
and
why
*NL*
do
n't
you
come
join
us
in
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
,
old
man
?
We
have
*NL*
some
corking
times
together
,
and
we
need
your
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
did
Babbitt
,
almost
tearful
with
joy
at
being
coaxed
instead
of
*NL*
bullied
,
at
being
permitted
to
stop
fighting
,
at
being
able
to
desert
*NL*
without
injuring
his
opinion
of
himself
,
cease
utterly
to
be
a
domestic
*NL*
revolutionist
.
He
patted
Gunch
's
shoulder
,
and
next
day
he
became
a
*NL*
member
of
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
two
weeks
no
one
in
the
League
was
more
violent
regarding
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
Seneca
Doane
,
the
crimes
of
labor
unions
,
the
perils
of
*NL*
immigration
,
and
the
delights
of
golf
,
morality
,
and
bank-accounts
than
*NL*
was
George
F.
Babbitt
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
Good
Citizens
'
League
had
spread
through
the
country
,
but
nowhere
*NL*
was
it
so
effective
and
well
esteemed
as
in
cities
of
the
type
of
*NL*
Zenith
,
commercial
cities
of
a
few
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
,
most
*NL*
of
which
--
though
not
all
--
lay
inland
,
against
a
background
of
*NL*
cornfields
and
mines
and
of
small
towns
which
depended
upon
them
for
*NL*
mortgage-loans
,
table-manners
,
art
,
social
philosophy
and
millinery
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
League
belonged
most
of
the
prosperous
citizens
of
Zenith
.
They
*NL*
were
not
all
of
the
kind
who
called
themselves
``
Regular
Guys
.
''
Besides
*NL*
these
hearty
fellows
,
these
salesmen
of
prosperity
,
there
were
the
*NL*
aristocrats
,
that
is
,
the
men
who
were
richer
or
had
been
rich
for
more
*NL*
generations
:
the
presidents
of
banks
and
of
factories
,
the
land-owners
,
*NL*
the
corporation
lawyers
,
the
fashionable
doctors
,
and
the
few
young-old
*NL*
men
who
worked
not
at
all
but
,
reluctantly
remaining
in
Zenith
,
*NL*
collected
luster-ware
and
first
editions
as
though
they
were
back
in
*NL*
Paris
.
All
of
them
agreed
that
the
working-classes
must
be
kept
in
their
*NL*
place
;
and
all
of
them
perceived
that
American
Democracy
did
not
imply
*NL*
any
equality
of
wealth
,
but
did
demand
a
wholesome
sameness
of
thought
,
*NL*
dress
,
painting
,
morals
,
and
vocabulary
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
they
were
like
the
ruling-class
of
any
other
country
,
*NL*
particularly
of
Great
Britain
,
but
they
differed
in
being
more
vigorous
*NL*
and
in
actually
trying
to
produce
the
accepted
standards
which
all
*NL*
classes
,
everywhere
,
desire
,
but
usually
despair
of
realizing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
longest
struggle
of
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
was
against
the
*NL*
Open
Shop
--
which
was
secretly
a
struggle
against
all
union
labor
.
*NL*
Accompanying
it
was
an
Americanization
Movement
,
with
evening
classes
in
*NL*
English
and
history
and
economics
,
and
daily
articles
in
the
newspapers
,
*NL*
so
that
newly
arrived
foreigners
might
learn
that
the
true-blue
and
*NL*
one
hundred
per
cent
.
American
way
of
settling
labor-troubles
was
for
*NL*
workmen
to
trust
and
love
their
employers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
League
was
more
than
generous
in
approving
other
organizations
*NL*
which
agreed
with
its
aims
.
It
helped
the
Y.M.
C.A.
to
raise
a
*NL*
two-hundred-thousand-dollar
fund
for
a
new
building
.
Babbitt
,
Vergil
*NL*
Gunch
,
Sidney
Finkelstein
,
and
even
Charles
McKelvey
told
the
spectators
*NL*
at
movie
theaters
how
great
an
influence
for
manly
Christianity
the
*NL*
``
good
old
Y.
''
had
been
in
their
own
lives
;
and
the
hoar
and
mighty
*NL*
Colonel
Rutherford
Snow
,
owner
of
the
Advocate-Times
,
was
photographed
*NL*
clasping
the
hand
of
Sheldon
Smeeth
of
the
Y.M.C.A.
.
It
is
true
*NL*
that
afterward
,
when
Smeeth
lisped
,
``
You
must
come
to
one
of
our
*NL*
prayer-meetings
,
''
the
ferocious
Colonel
bellowed
,
``
What
the
hell
would
*NL*
I
do
that
for
?
I
've
got
a
bar
of
my
own
,
''
but
this
did
not
appear
in
the
*NL*
public
prints
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
League
was
of
value
to
the
American
Legion
at
a
time
when
certain
of
*NL*
the
lesser
and
looser
newspapers
were
criticizing
that
organization
of
*NL*
veterans
of
the
Great
War
.
One
evening
a
number
of
young
men
raided
*NL*
the
Zenith
Socialist
Headquarters
,
burned
its
records
,
beat
the
*NL*
office
staff
,
and
agreeably
dumped
desks
out
of
the
window
.
All
of
the
*NL*
newspapers
save
the
Advocate-Times
and
the
Evening
Advocate
attributed
*NL*
this
valuable
but
perhaps
hasty
direct-action
to
the
American
Legion
.
*NL*
Then
a
flying
squadron
from
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
called
on
the
*NL*
unfair
papers
and
explained
that
no
ex-soldier
could
possibly
do
such
*NL*
a
thing
,
and
the
editors
saw
the
light
,
and
retained
their
advertising
.
*NL*
When
Zenith
's
lone
Conscientious
Objector
came
home
from
prison
and
was
*NL*
righteously
run
out
of
town
,
the
newspapers
referred
to
the
perpetrators
*NL*
as
an
``
unidentified
mob
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
activities
and
triumphs
of
the
Good
Citizens
'
League
Babbitt
*NL*
took
part
,
and
completely
won
back
to
self-respect
,
placidity
,
and
the
*NL*
affection
of
his
friends
.
But
he
began
to
protest
,
``
Gosh
,
I
've
done
my
*NL*
share
in
cleaning
up
the
city
.
I
want
to
tend
to
business
.
Think
I
'll
*NL*
just
kind
of
slacken
up
on
this
G.C.L.
stuff
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
returned
to
the
church
as
he
had
returned
to
the
Boosters
'
Club
.
*NL*
He
had
even
endured
the
lavish
greeting
which
Sheldon
Smeeth
gave
him
.
*NL*
He
was
worried
lest
during
his
late
discontent
he
had
imperiled
his
*NL*
salvation
.
He
was
not
quite
sure
there
was
a
Heaven
to
be
attained
,
but
*NL*
Dr.
John
Jennison
Drew
said
there
was
,
and
Babbitt
was
not
going
to
take
*NL*
a
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
when
he
was
walking
past
Dr.
Drew
's
parsonage
he
impulsively
*NL*
went
in
and
found
the
pastor
in
his
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jus
'
minute
--
getting
`
phone
call
,
''
said
Dr.
Drew
in
businesslike
tones
,
*NL*
then
,
aggressively
,
to
the
telephone
:
''
`
Lo
--
`
lo
!
This
Berkey
and
Hannis
?
*NL*
Reverend
Drew
speaking
.
Where
the
dickens
is
the
proof
for
next
Sunday
's
*NL*
calendar
?
Huh
?
Y
'
ought
to
have
it
here
.
Well
,
I
ca
n't
help
it
if
*NL*
they
're
ALL
sick
!
I
got
to
have
it
to-night
.
Get
an
A.D.T.
boy
and
shoot
*NL*
it
up
here
quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
,
without
slackening
his
briskness
.
``
Well
,
Brother
Babbitt
,
*NL*
what
c
'n
I
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
wanted
to
ask
--
Tell
you
how
it
is
,
dominie
:
Here
a
while
ago
I
*NL*
guess
I
got
kind
of
slack
.
Took
a
few
drinks
and
so
on
.
What
I
wanted
*NL*
to
ask
is
:
How
is
it
if
a
fellow
cuts
that
all
out
and
comes
back
to
his
*NL*
senses
?
Does
it
sort
of
,
well
,
you
might
say
,
does
it
score
against
him
*NL*
in
the
long
run
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Reverend
Dr.
Drew
was
suddenly
interested
.
``
And
,
uh
,
brother
--
the
*NL*
other
things
,
too
?
Women
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
practically
,
you
might
say
,
practically
not
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hesitate
to
tell
me
,
brother
!
That
's
what
I
'm
here
for
.
Been
*NL*
going
on
joy-rides
?
Squeezing
girls
in
cars
?
''
The
reverend
eyes
*NL*
glistened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
.
I
've
got
a
deputation
from
the
Do
n't
Make

Prohibition
a
Joke
Association
coming
to
see
me
in
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
and
one
from
the
Anti-Birth-Control
Union
at
a
quarter
of
ten
.
''
He
*NL*
busily
glanced
at
his
watch
.
``
But
I

*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
's
scalp
itched
and
he
longed
to
flee
,
but
Dr.
Drew
had
already
*NL*
flopped
down
beside
his
desk-chair
and
his
voice
had
changed
from
*NL*
rasping
efficiency
to
an
unctuous
familiarity
with
sin
and
with
the
*NL*
Almighty
.
Babbitt
also
knelt
,
while
Drew
gloated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
thou
seest
our
brother
here
,

been
led
astray

*NL*
Sheldon
Smeeth
came
frolicking
into
the
study
.
At
the
sight
of
the
two
*NL*
men
he
smirked
,
forgivingly
patted
Babbitt
on
the
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
knelt
beside
him
,
his
arm
about
him
,
while
he
authorized
Dr.
Drew
's
*NL*
imprecations
with
moans
of
``
Yes
,
Lord
!
Help
our
brother
,
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
he
was
trying
to
keep
his
eyes
closed
,
Babbitt
squinted
between
*NL*
his
fingers
and
saw
the
pastor
glance
at
his
watch
as
he
concluded
with
*NL*
a
triumphant
,
``
And
let
him
never
be
afraid
to
come
to
Us
for
counsel
and
*NL*
tender
care
,
and
let
him
know
that
the
church
can
lead
him
as
a
little
*NL*
lamb

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Drew
sprang
up
,
rolled
his
eyes
in
the
general
direction
of
Heaven
,
*NL*
chucked
his
watch
into
his
pocket
,
and
demanded
,
``
Has

come

Sheldy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yep

Sheldy
answered
,
with
equal
liveliness
;
then
,
*NL*
caressingly
,
to
Babbitt
,
``

``

yelped
Babbitt
,
rushing
toward
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thereafter
he
was
often
seen
at
the
Chatham
Road
Presbyterian
Church
,
*NL*
but
it
is
recorded
that
he
avoided
shaking
hands
with
the
pastor
at
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
If
his
moral
fiber
had
been
so
weakened
by
rebellion
that
he
was
not
*NL*
quite
dependable
in
the
more
rigorous
campaigns
of
the
Good
Citizens
'
*NL*
League
nor
quite
appreciative
of
the
church
,
yet
there
was
no
doubt
of
*NL*
the
joy
with
which
Babbitt
returned
to
the
pleasures
of
his
home
and
of
*NL*
the
Athletic
Club
,
the
Boosters
,
the
Elks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Verona
and
Kenneth
Escott
were
eventually
and
hesitatingly
married
.
*NL*
For
the
wedding
Babbitt
was
dressed
as
carefully
as
was
Verona
;
he
was
*NL*
crammed
into
the
morning-coat
he
wore
to
teas
thrice
a
year
;
and
with
a
*NL*
certain
relief
,
after
Verona
and
Kenneth
had
driven
away
in
a
limousine
,
*NL*
he
returned
to
the
house
,
removed
the
morning
coat
,
sat
with
his
aching
*NL*
feet
up
on
the
davenport
,
and
reflected
that
his
wife
and
he
could
have
*NL*
the
living-room
to
themselves
now
,
and
not
have
to
listen
to
Verona
and
*NL*
Kenneth
worrying
,
in
a
cultured
collegiate
manner
,
about
minimum
wages
*NL*
and
the
Drama
League
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
this
sinking
into
peace
was
less
consoling
than
his
return
to
*NL*
being
one
of
the
best-loved
men
in
the
Boosters
'
Club
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
President
Willis
Ijams
began
that
Boosters
'
Club
luncheon
by
standing
*NL*
quiet
and
staring
at
them
so
unhappily
that
they
feared
he
was
about
*NL*
to
announce
the
death
of
a
Brother
Booster
.
He
spoke
slowly
then
,
and
*NL*
gravely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
I
have
something
shocking
to
reveal
to
you
;
something
terrible
*NL*
about
one
of
our
own
members

''
*NL*
*NL*
Several
Boosters
,
including
Babbitt
,
looked
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
knight
of
the
grip
,
a
trusted
friend
of
mine
,
recently
made
a
trip
*NL*
up-state
,
and
in
a
certain
town
,
where
a
certain
Booster
spent
his
*NL*
boyhood
,
he
found
out
something
which
can
no
longer
be
concealed
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
he
discovered
the
inward
nature
of
a
man
whom
we
have
accepted
as
*NL*
a
Real
Guy
and
as
one
of
us
.
Gentlemen
,
I
can
not
trust
my
voice
to
say
*NL*
it
,
so
I
have
written
it
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
uncovered
a
large
blackboard
and
on
it
,
in
huge
capitals
,
was
the
*NL*
legend
:
*NL*
*NL*
George
Follansbee
Babbitt
--
oh
you
Folly
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
Boosters
cheered
,
they
laughed
,
they
wept
,
they
threw
rolls
at
*NL*
Babbitt
,
they
cried
,
``
Speech
,
speech
!
Oh
you
Folly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
President
Ijams
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

gentlemen

is
the
awful
thing
Georgie
Babbitt
has
been
concealing
*NL*
all
these
years

when
we
thought
he
was
just
plain
George
F

Now
I
want
*NL*
you
to
tell
us

taking
it
in

what
you

supposed

,
they
suggested
,
and
Frog-face
and
Flathead
and
Farinaceous
and
*NL*
Freezone
and
Flapdoodle
and
Foghorn
.
By
the
joviality
of
their
insults
*NL*
Babbitt
knew
that
he
had
been
taken
back
to
their
hearts
,
and
happily
he
*NL*
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys

I
've
got
to
admit

I

never

my
name
in
the
middle
,
but
I
will
confess
to

Follansbee

'
My
only
*NL*
justification
is
that
my
old
dad
--
though
otherwise
he
was
perfectly
*NL*
sane
,
and
packed
an
awful
wallop
when
it
came
to
trimming
the

named
me
after

apologize

In
my
next
what-d'you-call-it
I
'll
see
*NL*
to
it
that
I
get
named
something
really
practical
--
something
that
sounds
*NL*
swell
and
yet
is
good
and
virile

something
,
in
fact
,
like
that
*NL*
grand
old
name
so
familiar
to
every
household

that
bold
and
almost
*NL*
overpowering
name

*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
by
the
cheer
that
he
was
secure
again
and
popular
;
he
knew
that
*NL*
he
would
no
more
endanger
his
security
and
popularity
by
straying
from
*NL*
the
Clan
of
Good
Fellows

*NL*
*NL*

V
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Thompson
dashed
into
the
office
,
clamoring
,
``

news

Traction
Bunch
are
dissatisfied
with

way

their
last
deal
,
and
they
're
willing
to
*NL*
dicker
with
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
was
pleased
in
the
realization
that
the
last
scar
of
his
*NL*
rebellion
was
healed
,
yet
as
he
drove
home
he
was
annoyed
by
such
*NL*
background
thoughts
as
had
never
weakened
him
in
his
days
of
belligerent
*NL*
conformity
.
He
discovered
that
he
actually
did
not
consider
the
Traction
*NL*
group
quite
honest
.
``
Well
,
he
'd
carry
out
one
more
deal
for
them
,
but
*NL*
as
soon
as
it
was
practicable
,
maybe
as
soon
as
old
Henry
Thompson
died
,
*NL*
he
'd
break
away
from
all
association
from
them
.
He
was
forty-eight
;
in
*NL*
twelve
years
he
'd
be
sixty
;
he
wanted
to
leave
a
clean
business
to
his
*NL*
grandchildren
.
Course
there
was
a
lot
of
money
in
negotiating
for
the
*NL*
Traction
people
,
and
a
fellow
had
to
look
at
things
in
a
practical
way
,
*NL*
only
--
''
He
wriggled
uncomfortably
.
He
wanted
to
tell
the
Traction
group
*NL*
what
he
thought
of
them
.
``
Oh
,
he
could
n't
do
it
,
not
now

If
he
offended
*NL*
them
this
second
time
,
they
would
crush
him
.
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
that
his
line
of
progress
seemed
confused
.
He
wondered
*NL*
what
he
would
do
with
his
future
.
He
was
still
young
;
was
he
through
*NL*
with
all
adventuring
?
He
felt
that
he
had
been
trapped
into
the
very
*NL*
net
from
which
he
had
with
such
fury
escaped
and
,
supremest
jest
of
all
,
*NL*
been
made
to
rejoice
in
the
trapping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
licked
me
;
licked
me
to
a
finish
!
''
he
whimpered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
peaceful
,
that
evening
,
and
he
enjoyed
a
game
of
pinochle
*NL*
with
his
wife
.
He
indignantly
told
the
Tempter
that
he
was
content
to
do
*NL*
things
in
the
good
old
fashioned
way
.
The
day
after
,
he
went
to
see
the
*NL*
purchasing-agent
of
the
Street
Traction
Company
and
they
made
plans
for
*NL*
the
secret
purchase
of
lots
along
the
Evanston
Road
.
But
as
he
drove
to
*NL*
his
office
he
struggled
,
``
I
'm
going
to
run
things
and
figure
out
things
*NL*
to
suit
myself

when
I
retire

Ted
had
come
down
from
the
University
for
the
week-end
.
Though
he
no
*NL*
longer
spoke
of
mechanical
engineering
and
though
he
was
reticent
about
*NL*
his
opinion
of
his
instructors
,
he
seemed
no
more
reconciled
to
college
,
*NL*
and
his
chief
interest
was
his
wireless
telephone
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
evening
he
took
Eunice
Littlefield
to
a
dance
at
Devon
*NL*
Woods
.
Babbitt
had
a
glimpse
of
her
,
bouncing
in
the
seat
of
the
car
,
*NL*
brilliant
in
a
scarlet
cloak
over
a
frock
of
thinnest
creamy
silk
.
They
*NL*
two
had
not
returned
when
the
Babbitts
went
to
bed
,
at
half-past
eleven
.
*NL*
At
a
blurred
indefinite
time
of
late
night
Babbitt
was
awakened
by
*NL*
the
ring
of
the
telephone
and
gloomily
crawled
down-stairs
.
Howard
*NL*
Littlefield
was
speaking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
Euny
is
n't
back
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

at
least
his
door
is
open
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ought
to
be
home

Eunice
said
the
dance
would
be
over
at
midnight
.
*NL*
What
's
the
name
of
those
people
where
they
're
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
gosh
,
tell
the
truth

I
do
n't
know

Howard
.
It
's
some
classmate
of
*NL*
Ted
's
,
out
in
Devon
Woods
.
Do
n't
see
what
we
can
do
.
Wait
,
I
'll
skip
up
*NL*
and
ask
Myra
if
she
knows
their
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babbitt
turned
on
the
light
in
Ted
's
room
.
It
was
a
brown
boyish
room
;
*NL*
disordered
dresser
,
worn
books
,
a
high-school
pennant
,
photographs
of
*NL*
basket-ball
teams
and
baseball
teams
.
Ted
was
decidedly
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Babbitt
,
awakened
,
irritably
observed
that
she
certainly
did
not
*NL*
know
the
name
of
Ted
's
host
,
that
it
was
late
,
that
Howard
Littlefield
*NL*
was
but
little
better
than
a
born
fool
,
and
that
she
was
sleepy
.
But
*NL*
she
remained
awake
and
worrying
while
Babbitt
,
on
the
sleeping-porch
,
*NL*
struggled
back
into
sleep
through
the
incessant
soft
rain
of
her
*NL*
remarks
.
It
was
after
dawn
when
he
was
aroused
by
her
shaking
him
and
*NL*
calling
``
George
!
George
!
''
in
something
like
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wha
--
wha
--
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
quick
and
see

Be
quiet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
led
him
down
the
hall
to
the
door
of
Ted
's
room
and
pushed
it
gently
*NL*
open
.
On
the
worn
brown
rug
he
saw
a
froth
of
rose-colored
chiffon
*NL*
lingerie
;
on
the
sedate
Morris
chair
a
girl
's
silver
slipper
.
And
on
the
*NL*
pillows
were
two
sleepy
heads
--
Ted
's
and
Eunice
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ted
woke
to
grin
,
and
to
mutter
with
unconvincing
defiance
,
``
Good
*NL*
morning
!
Let
me
introduce
my
wife

Mrs.
Theodore
Roosevelt
Eunice

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

''
from
Babbitt
,
and
from
his
wife
a
long
wailing
,
``
You

gone
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Eunice
hid
her
shoulders
and
her
charming
wild
hair
under
the
*NL*
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
nine
o'clock
the
assembly
which
was
gathered
about
Ted
and
Eunice
*NL*
in
the
living-room
included
Mr.

Mrs.
George
Babbitt

,
and
Tinka
Babbitt
,
who
was
the
only
pleased
member
of
the
*NL*
inquisition
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crackling
shower
of
phrases
filled
the
room
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
their
age

``

here

all

I

getting

If
you
want

kill
somebody

go
kill
the
preacher

Why

he
stung
me
five
dollars

and
all
the
money
I
had
in

the

was
six

A
new
voice

booming
,
authoritative
,
dominated
the

It
was
Babbitt

*NL*
``
Yuh

there

many
putting

Rone

you

I

still

strong

able

do

Ted

come
into

*NL*
In

,
the
door
firmly
closed
,
Babbitt
walked
to
his
son
,
*NL*
put
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
.
``
You
're
more
or
less
right
.
They
all
*NL*
talk
too
much

Now
what
do
you
plan
to
do
,
old
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh

dad

are
you
really
going

be
human

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
--
Remember
one
time
you
called
us
`
the
Babbitt
men

and
said
we
*NL*
ought
to
stick
together
?
I
want
to
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
think
this
is
n't
*NL*
serious
.
The
way
the
cards
are
stacked
against
a
young
fellow
to-day
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
I
approve
of
early
marriages
.
But
you
could
n't
have
married
a
*NL*
better
girl
than
Eunice
;
and
way
I
figure
it
,
Littlefield
is
darn
lucky
*NL*
to
get
a
Babbitt
for
a
son-in-law
!
But
what
do
you
plan
to
do
?
Course
*NL*
you
could
go
right
ahead
with
the
U.
,
and
when
you
'd
finished

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dad
,
I
ca
n't
stand
it
any
more

Maybe
it

all
right

some
fellows

*NL*
Maybe
I
'll
want
to
go
back
some
day
.
But
me
,
I
want
to
get
into
*NL*
mechanics
.
I
think
I
'd
get
to
be
a
good
inventor
.
There
's
a
fellow
that
*NL*
would
give
me
twenty
dollars
a
week
in
a
factory
right
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
Babbitt
crossed
the
floor
,
slowly
,
ponderously
,
seeming
a
*NL*
little
old
.
``
I
've
always
wanted
you
to
have
a
college
degree
.
''
He
*NL*
meditatively
stamped
across
the
floor
again
.
``
But
I
've
never
--
Now
,
for
*NL*
heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
repeat
this
to
your
mother
,
or
she
'd
remove
what
*NL*
little
hair
I
've
got
left
,
but
practically
,
I
've
never
done
a
single
*NL*
thing
I
've
wanted
to
in
my
whole
life
!
I
do
n't
know
's
I
've
accomplished
*NL*
anything
except
just
get
along
.
I
figure
out
I
've
made
about
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
inch
out
of
a
possible
hundred
rods
.
Well
,
maybe
you
'll
carry
*NL*
things
on
further
.
I
do
n't
know
.
But
I
do
get
a
kind
of
sneaking
*NL*
pleasure
out
of
the
fact
that
you
knew
what
you
wanted
to
do
and
did
*NL*
it
.
Well
,
those
folks
in
there
will
try
to
bully
you
,
and
tame
you
down
.
*NL*
Tell
'em
to
go
to
the
devil
!
I
'll
back
you
.
Take
your
factory
job
,
if
*NL*
you
want
to
.
Do
n't
be
scared
of
the
family
.
No
,
nor
all
of
Zenith
.
Nor
*NL*
of
yourself
,
the
way
I
've
been
.
Go
ahead
,
old
man
!
The
world
is
yours
!

*NL*
*NL*
Arms
about
each
other
's
shoulders
,
the
Babbitt

marched
into
the
*NL*
living-room

faced
the
swooping
family
